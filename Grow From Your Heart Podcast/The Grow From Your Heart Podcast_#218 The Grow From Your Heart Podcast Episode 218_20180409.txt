[00:25.340 --> 00:30.540]  Yeah, what's up cannabis community? It's time for episode 52 of the Grow From Your Heart
[00:30.540 --> 00:36.340]  podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. If you're a new grower or
[00:36.340 --> 00:40.460]  a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a cannabis
[00:40.460 --> 00:44.120]  activist or if you're just curious about the current state of cannabis, this my friends
[00:44.120 --> 00:48.260]  is the podcast for you. Thanks for joining me. I'm your host Rasta Jeff. I want to send
[00:48.260 --> 00:52.140]  a huge thanks to the Mystic Roots Band. Thanks a lot for letting me play your music on the
[00:52.140 --> 00:55.780]  show guys. You're listening to the Mystic Roots Band. The song is DJ and a dance, the
[00:55.780 --> 00:59.580]  instrumental version. The intro I usually play is called the doggy dub. I wanted to
[00:59.580 --> 01:04.460]  switch it up, bring some spice to your life. Variety is the spice of life. So big shout
[01:04.460 --> 01:07.820]  out to Kat and Coot from the Mystic Roots Band. How are you guys doing? Thanks for joining
[01:07.820 --> 01:13.540]  me. Coming to you on, today was our good friend, Jesse's birthday and it was also cousin Tater's
[01:13.540 --> 01:19.220]  birthday. So I just got home from Jesse and Tater's birthday party. Dude, that was a fun
[01:19.220 --> 01:23.300]  party. I am not an alcohol drinker. So I left when the alcohol kind of got a little
[01:23.300 --> 01:28.180]  heavy, but we retreated back to the garden of Whedon and Spence and Maddie and Michael
[01:28.180 --> 01:33.860]  and Big Mike and myself and Joe hung out and took some dabs after the rest of the party.
[01:33.860 --> 01:37.940]  But man, big shout out to Jesse and Tater. I keep calling you Tater, dude. Your name's
[01:37.940 --> 01:41.420]  Jason. What's up cousin Tater and Uncle Jesse. Happy birthday, you guys. I hope you had as
[01:41.420 --> 01:45.820]  much fun as I did. Thanks for bringing me to your party. Also huge, huge shout out to
[01:45.820 --> 01:50.540]  Maddie and Spence. They had a little dinner at their house before the party. We went to
[01:50.540 --> 01:53.580]  a bowling alley and tried to bowl, but it was too damn crowded. So everyone just ended
[01:53.580 --> 01:57.820]  up in the bar. But before that, we went to Spence and Maddie's and had some food. And
[01:57.820 --> 02:01.420]  I'm a vegetarian and I will not eat anything with animals or animal products in it. That's
[02:01.420 --> 02:05.460]  just my personal preference. You can eat what you want. I don't judge you, but I don't eat
[02:05.460 --> 02:11.540]  animals. They were nice enough to make me several. There was an entree for me. They
[02:11.540 --> 02:15.620]  made a portobello, a big portobello mushroom, and I put it on a bun and I called it a portobello
[02:15.620 --> 02:19.980]  mushroom burger. I put a couple slices of avocado, some Swiss cheese, put a little bit
[02:19.980 --> 02:23.780]  of onion on there. It was delicious. They made some potatoes that were delicious and
[02:23.780 --> 02:28.140]  some potato salad or some pasta salad. That was amazing. So big, huge shout out to those
[02:28.140 --> 02:33.540]  guys for catering to my picky ass and taking care of me and my picky diet. That's really
[02:33.540 --> 02:36.740]  cool. So shout out to Spence and Maddie. I appreciate it, you guys. Thanks for having
[02:36.740 --> 02:42.060]  me at the party. Love it. Love you guys every day. So yesterday was Bob Marley's birthday
[02:42.060 --> 02:45.380]  since we're doing birthday shout outs. I got dreadlocks and I'm a Rasta. So you know I
[02:45.420 --> 02:49.900]  love me some Bob Marley. Big shout out to Bob Marley. There's a lot of other reggae,
[02:49.900 --> 02:52.980]  you guys. Everyone always tells me when they see my dreadlocks, their first thing a lot
[02:52.980 --> 02:56.340]  of people say is, I love Bob Marley. Dude, there's more reggae. Listen to some other
[02:56.340 --> 03:01.140]  reggae. Check out some Steel Pulse. Check out some Morgan Heritage. And if you're into
[03:01.140 --> 03:05.180]  it, it's a little bit different. Check out some Bounty Killer and some Capleton and see
[03:05.180 --> 03:10.620]  where I was inspired to name my strains from. I honored two of my favorite reggae artists.
[03:10.620 --> 03:14.540]  Actually three of them. The Kalonji is after Sizzla Kalonji. So check out Sizzla, Bounty
[03:14.540 --> 03:18.540]  Killer and Capleton also and see where I decided to name some of my strains that I've
[03:18.540 --> 03:22.380]  bred from. I'm doing an episode by myself, guys. So I'm just going to be rambling for
[03:22.380 --> 03:27.740]  a little while. I've got some news articles and this will be the episode where I am going
[03:27.740 --> 03:32.540]  to announce the winners from episode number 50. So I'm probably going to probably going
[03:32.540 --> 03:38.180]  to do that towards the end of the show just to keep you listening because that's how you
[03:38.180 --> 03:41.020]  build suspense and keep people listening. But this is the one. So if you entered the
[03:41.020 --> 03:46.060]  contest on Facebook and or Instagram, this could be the show where you're going to get
[03:46.060 --> 03:49.060]  excited and win some shit. So keep listening and I'll tell you the winners in a minute
[03:49.060 --> 03:52.420]  here. Before we get that far, I have to do this part. This podcast is brought to you
[03:52.420 --> 03:56.960]  by some of my good friends, some of my favorite people, Jesse and Bern over at Hygro Indoor

[04:40.920 --> 04:46.360]  Rocky Mountain Worm Company Worm Castings. Dude, if you've messed with worm castings
[04:46.360 --> 04:50.440]  before, the minute you pick up this bag of worm castings, you will know that this is
[04:50.440 --> 04:55.840]  a high quality bag of castings. Nobody paid me to say that. I bought a bag of it myself
[04:55.840 --> 05:00.960]  and it smells rich like worm casting should. It's the proper color. I made a little bit
[05:00.960 --> 05:06.640]  of tea out of it and that tea foamed up really nice. It smelled good. A lot of people are
[05:06.640 --> 05:09.840]  going to think I'm gross because I think the worm tea smells good, but it smelled the way
[05:09.840 --> 05:14.160]  it was supposed to. Quality, quality worm castings. I apologize for the mic bump right
[05:14.160 --> 05:18.720]  there. That was weird. All right. So check out Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies. Also, big
[05:18.720 --> 05:23.920]  shout out to Jay and the Rocky Mountain Worm Company. They are scheduled, Jay and one of
[05:23.920 --> 05:27.000]  his partners whose first name I do not know. I know his Instagram name, but I don't know
[05:27.000 --> 05:30.520]  his real name. Jay from Rocky Mountain Worm Company and one of his partners are scheduled
[05:30.520 --> 05:35.560]  to be here on this podcast. They're supposed to be here Tuesday afternoon. I think we said
[05:35.560 --> 05:38.360]  six o'clock. It might've been five o'clock. I'll check my scheduling, but they will be
[05:38.360 --> 05:43.640]  here to record a podcast. So next episode should be Jay from Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[05:43.640 --> 05:49.960]  And we're going to talk about worms and environmentally sustainable cannabis and organics. And we'll
[05:49.960 --> 05:53.240]  see what Jay brings to the table. I'm going to kind of let them talk and tell us what
[05:53.240 --> 05:59.880]  they want to say. And coming up after that, I think will be an episode with Jesse talking
[05:59.880 --> 06:05.480]  about we want to give a lesson on light deprivation so that you guys can get your outdoor crops
[06:05.480 --> 06:08.920]  going a little bit earlier this year. So we're going to start, we're starting to plan more
[06:08.920 --> 06:12.280]  outdoor lessons. I'm just letting you guys know we got a lot of cool shit coming up.
[06:12.280 --> 06:16.400]  I'm not slacking off like I used to. I'm trying to get more on top of the podcast. I used
[06:16.400 --> 06:20.080]  to do it week by week. Now I'm trying to be a week or two ahead of myself. It just feels
[06:20.080 --> 06:23.720]  better and I feel like I'm bringing you a better show, which I want to keep doing. Thanks
[06:23.720 --> 06:26.680]  for listening. Thanks to somebody told me that they went back and listened to a bunch
[06:26.680 --> 06:30.720]  of old episodes and I felt embarrassed, but then they told me, don't be embarrassed because
[06:30.720 --> 06:34.280]  I'm kicking ass now. And they got to see the progression. So that's cool. Thanks a lot,
[06:34.280 --> 06:36.240]  dude. The guy that said that, you know who you are.
[06:36.240 --> 06:40.320]  One more ad. This podcast is brought to you by our good friends at naturesgreenremedies.com.

[07:55.480 --> 08:01.320]  it is product reviews. So where was I? I want to take a minute and read a couple of the
[08:01.320 --> 08:06.380]  Facebook and Stitcher comments that I've gotten recently. I had to save them on my phone.
[08:06.380 --> 08:11.840]  So I'm searching through the phone right now to find that. Come on, iPhone. Man, my iPhone
[08:11.840 --> 08:18.840]  has been slow lately. All right, here we go. This is a comment that was left on our iTunes
[08:20.880 --> 08:25.560]  the Grow From Your Heart iTunes page. This comment was from a person who calls himself
[08:25.560 --> 08:31.840]  Sticky Wiki. He gave us five stars and he says, good listen, recently found the podcast.
[08:31.840 --> 08:36.400]  I have followed iRegenetics on IG, which is Instagram. I followed iRegenetics on Instagram
[08:36.400 --> 08:41.560]  for a while now and I'm really enjoying some of these episodes and take care. So right
[08:41.560 --> 08:46.000]  on dude. Sticky Wiki gave us five stars and loves the show. Thanks for listening, bro.
[08:46.000 --> 08:49.960]  Thanks for also, thanks for following iRegenetics on Instagram. I'm glad to have you on there.
[08:49.960 --> 08:54.040]  Go comment on something and I will follow you. Show me who you are and I'll follow you
[08:54.040 --> 09:00.600]  back. Our next comment was from a guy named Buzzer with a bunch of Zs. He said, sweet
[09:00.600 --> 09:07.040]  show five stars. And his comment was, thanks for making this for us. Dude, you're very
[09:07.040 --> 09:11.080]  welcome. Thanks for listening. Thanks for commenting. Thanks for showing me that you
[09:11.080 --> 09:14.840]  appreciate it. That makes it all worth it. I hope you're growing better cannabis than
[09:14.840 --> 09:19.920]  you were before and I hope you have a better understanding of the cannabis plant, the community
[09:19.920 --> 09:24.400]  and my goal of the plant. I hope you learned some stuff and thanks a lot, man. And then
[09:24.400 --> 09:27.600]  Robert Lee commented, Robert Lee, I know who you are, dude. Thanks for finally listening
[09:27.600 --> 09:30.400]  to the show. I've been trying to get you to listen to the podcast for a little while.
[09:30.400 --> 09:34.760]  You seem to be reluctant to hear me on the show, but thanks for listening. His comment
[09:34.760 --> 09:39.280]  was left on Stitcher and he said, I really enjoyed this episode. Very informative. And
[09:39.280 --> 09:44.520]  he left that comment on episode 51, our CBD episode, which featured Angela and my good
[09:44.520 --> 09:49.880]  buddy Clint. If you guys listen to that, you understand why I'm going to give a huge shout
[09:49.880 --> 09:53.880]  out to Angela for letting me post that entire show without editing anything. That was really
[09:53.880 --> 09:57.680]  cool of her. Some of what she said that was kind of personal and could have been embarrassing,
[09:57.680 --> 10:01.240]  but she's a bad-ass chick. She's a bad-ass woman. She deserves more respect than being
[10:01.240 --> 10:05.320]  called a chick. She's a bad-ass woman. And she let me post the entire conversation without
[10:05.320 --> 10:08.920]  a single edit. So that's really cool. Thank you. I hope you're listening to this episode.
[10:08.920 --> 10:15.160]  All right. So that was the Stitcher and iTunes comments. Sorry, I had a little bit of a brain
[10:15.160 --> 10:19.040]  fart there. I really appreciate you guys leaving comments. It shows me that you are listening
[10:19.040 --> 10:23.920]  to the show. And if you hate the show, you can leave a comment because I haven't gotten
[10:23.920 --> 10:28.600]  a shitty comment yet. And do people just not do that? Do you just not, or you probably
[10:28.600 --> 10:31.480]  skipped it and don't even want to listen if you hated it, right? You don't even go leave
[10:31.480 --> 10:34.760]  a shitty review, but it makes me feel good that people are liking it and giving me lots
[10:34.760 --> 10:38.200]  of good stars. Please leave me a review, you guys, because what that does is it boosts
[10:38.200 --> 10:42.680]  me up in the iTunes and in the Stitcher rankings. And then more people see the show. And then
[10:42.680 --> 10:46.800]  the more people see the show, the more listen. And then the more people grow better cannabis
[10:46.800 --> 10:50.880]  and the more people have a better education about cannabis. And then we can dispel a lot
[10:50.880 --> 10:56.520]  of the stupid myths and rumors. And then we can legalize cannabis worldwide. I think that's
[10:56.520 --> 11:02.040]  our goal for now is to legalize it and grow the best we can. Those are our two main objectives.
[11:02.040 --> 11:05.640]  If we're going to assign ourselves main goals, that's it. Grow the best cannabis we can and
[11:05.640 --> 11:10.240]  legalize this shit everywhere. All right. I'm really rambly today, which is good because
[11:10.240 --> 11:16.140]  I'm by myself. I think it's time to get into some news articles. Our first article has
[11:16.140 --> 11:22.260]  nothing to do with cannabis. Well, it loosely has something to do with cannabis. It's something
[11:22.260 --> 11:26.180]  that is personal to me and I found it very entertaining. The remaining members of the
[11:26.180 --> 11:31.020]  Grateful Dead, along with Trey from Phish, I know some of you guys are going blah, blah,
[11:31.020 --> 11:36.500]  blah right now, but just give me 10 seconds. There's a concert in Chicago on the third,
[11:36.500 --> 11:40.700]  fourth, and fifth of July at Soldier Field in Chicago. It is celebrating 50 years of
[11:40.700 --> 11:44.740]  the Grateful Dead. It's Mickey Hart, Bill Kruitzman, Phil Lesch, Bob Ware, Trey Anastasio,
[11:44.740 --> 11:49.900]  Jeff Chiminti, and Bruce Hornsby. Sorry, that was hard to read. They're doing three
[11:49.900 --> 11:55.340]  shows. It's all Grateful Dead music. This article comes from Jambase.com. It says, if
[11:55.340 --> 12:00.220]  you're like us, you were wondering just how many mail orders were received for Fare The
[12:00.220 --> 12:04.740]  Well, which will bring together Grateful Dead members, Bob Ware, Phil Lesch, Mickey Hart,
[12:04.740 --> 12:08.460]  and Bill Kruitzman, along with Trey Anastasio, Jeff Chiminti, and Bruce Hornsby for three
[12:08.460 --> 12:13.860]  nights of shows in Chicago over the fourth of July weekend. The answer is almost unbelievable.
[12:13.980 --> 12:18.100]  This is the part I wanted to talk about. As a note, on the event's website mentions that
[12:18.100 --> 12:24.580]  60,000 plus envelopes were received so far, which is by the company that's handling their
[12:24.580 --> 12:29.780]  mail order fulfillment. The tickets only went on sale through mail order, which is only
[12:29.780 --> 12:33.500]  the people that know what's up are going to be able to order the mail order. This isn't
[12:33.500 --> 12:39.940]  a publicly known thing. You got to be on the inside. They got 60,000 requests just from
[12:39.940 --> 12:45.900]  the mail order. That is amazing. That's crazy. This is going to be a huge event, you guys.
[12:45.900 --> 12:50.940]  If you're in Chicago on the third, fourth, or fifth of July, make sure you go check out
[12:50.940 --> 12:54.820]  Soldier Field. Even if you don't want to go to the concert, go see what it's like to be
[12:54.820 --> 12:59.660]  on a Grateful Dead lot, the parking lot scene. Just go see that hippie scene. Go see that
[12:59.660 --> 13:06.740]  community. I didn't get to see the Grateful Dead because I was only 15 when Jerry died,
[13:06.740 --> 13:13.540]  I think, 15 or 16, but I did see plenty of fish. At the time, fish took over for the
[13:13.540 --> 13:18.660]  Grateful Dead. The dead, fish, all of that stuff means something to me. If you guys go
[13:18.660 --> 13:22.060]  see that lot, go see that show. You never know, Rasta Jeff could be there. I have not
[13:22.060 --> 13:26.020]  committed to anything yet. Go see that show. Go check that shit out, dude. Go see what
[13:26.020 --> 13:30.820]  it's like. That's a lot of why I am who I am and a lot of what made me who I am.
[13:31.380 --> 13:37.060]  Honestly, the stream Chemdog was discovered in a bag of weed that was bought on a Grateful
[13:37.060 --> 13:40.780]  Dead parking lot at a Grateful Dead show. That's where Chemdog came from. If there weren't
[13:40.780 --> 13:44.780]  these silly hippies traveling around being deadheads, Chemdog would not exist. A lot
[13:44.780 --> 13:48.980]  of the streams that we work with now would not exist. Most of my lineup would not exist
[13:48.980 --> 13:55.140]  because a lot of my stuff is crossed with Chemdog. Anyway, news article here, number
[13:55.140 --> 14:00.740]  two. It says new regulations on pot edibles designed to protect children and adults. This
[14:00.740 --> 14:08.500]  was put out January 30th. This is actually from CBS Denver Channel 4. It says new regulations
[14:08.500 --> 14:12.500]  on pot edibles going to affect Sunday. Those regulations are designed to protect children
[14:12.500 --> 14:16.820]  and warn adults about the potency of marijuana edibles. The law is being put into place by
[14:16.820 --> 14:20.780]  the Colorado Department of Revenue. The agency is hoping to prevent problems that have put
[14:20.780 --> 14:25.860]  Colorado's budding retail pot industry under scrutiny. Then there's a picture of this African
[14:25.860 --> 14:31.500]  student and they're trying to blame a lot of this on him. I'll keep reading. Last year,
[14:31.500 --> 14:36.660]  African student and African and African student in Wyoming, Levi, I'm just going to say Levi
[14:36.660 --> 14:40.780]  Tomba, because I'm not sure how to pronounce that. Levi Tomba died after eating an entire
[14:40.780 --> 14:46.340]  marijuana infused cookie and jumping off a hotel balcony. There have also been several
[14:46.340 --> 14:51.180]  cases of children mistaking pot for candy. That means some changes for edibles, including
[14:51.180 --> 14:55.980]  placing marijuana infused candy and baked goods in childproof packaging. Each individual
[14:55.980 --> 15:00.740]  square of chocolate must be marked according to how potent it is. So you guys back in the
[15:00.740 --> 15:04.660]  day when you would buy, I can't even pick a brand because I don't want to like single
[15:04.660 --> 15:08.060]  out a brand back in the day when you would buy a large edible of a candy bar, it would
[15:08.060 --> 15:11.940]  be the size of your normal candy bar that you buy at the gas station or wherever you're
[15:11.940 --> 15:15.660]  at the grocery store, wherever you get your candy bar, right? You would buy that one candy
[15:15.660 --> 15:19.180]  bar and it would just look, it would be in a wrapper that was plainly marked. This is
[15:19.180 --> 15:23.900]  a ganja candy bar. But then once you open it, you can't tell at all. And now every single
[15:23.900 --> 15:27.820]  piece they have made a mold that you pour your chocolate into, not you, but the companies,
[15:27.820 --> 15:32.380]  they pour their chocolate into there and it divides it for you into little squares. And
[15:32.380 --> 15:36.020]  they're showing a picture of it. The whole candy bar is a hundred milligrams, but now
[15:36.020 --> 15:42.300]  they've divided it into 10 little squares and they're all labeled 10 milligrams THC
[15:42.300 --> 15:47.820]  for each little square. So now it's a little better because sometimes when you buy edibles,
[15:47.820 --> 15:52.820]  you don't remember what you bought or you don't remember which is which, or sometimes
[15:52.820 --> 15:56.140]  it's hard to tell if this is a third or if this is a quarter. So now these guys have
[15:56.140 --> 16:00.060]  really made it nice and easy for you. I'll keep reading the article. It says, at the
[16:00.060 --> 16:04.700]  Incredibles Edibles shop, they mark each square of chocolate with the number 10 to indicate
[16:04.700 --> 16:10.540]  10 milligrams of THC, the psychoactive ingredient of marijuana. 10 is the standard serving.
[16:11.420 --> 16:15.740]  In the past, chocolate didn't have to indicate the amount of THC in each bar. Some of them
[16:15.740 --> 16:19.580]  were in line with what industry feels will improve. I'm going to start that sentence again.
[16:19.580 --> 16:23.420]  I'm sorry. Some of them are in line with what the industry feels will improve safety out there.
[16:23.420 --> 16:28.220]  Others seem like overkill, but we were happy to do it, said Incredibles spokesman, Bob Aschino.
[16:29.180 --> 16:32.940]  Some clerks working at retail pot shops had been recommending much more, which could cause
[16:32.940 --> 16:37.580]  some issues with those who had not had much experience with edibles. Now edible packaging
[16:37.580 --> 16:42.380]  contains warnings to eat only a small amount and then wait before eating more. So it says,
[16:42.380 --> 16:48.780]  wait 45 minutes. So when you eat this, wait 45... This is a weirdly worded article. So it says,
[16:48.780 --> 16:53.340]  wait 45 minutes. So when you eat this, wait 45 minutes to see how it affects you. And then you
[16:53.340 --> 16:59.580]  can continue with another dose if you really wanted to, says Sweet Leaf spokeswoman, Elizabeth
[16:59.580 --> 17:04.540]  D. That's a long last name. Elizabeth D. I won't butcher that for you. So they're showing a picture
[17:04.540 --> 17:08.860]  of the package and it totally shows like a little... It says to educate and to medicate.
[17:08.860 --> 17:11.580]  And there's like a little clock on there, like the one that you'd see at the store that says,
[17:11.580 --> 17:17.660]  be back in 10 minutes. Instead it shows, it says, take one square, wait two hours. So they're
[17:17.660 --> 17:21.180]  trying to encourage you to take one and wait two hours. The problem is a lot of people don't do,
[17:21.180 --> 17:24.860]  they think they're bad-asses and they can just eat it all. But back into the article,
[17:24.860 --> 17:29.660]  a variety of the marijuana infused products, including drinks, cookies, and candies come in
[17:29.660 --> 17:34.380]  single servings. We just want to educate people that five milligrams is a good serving. Not too
[17:34.380 --> 17:39.820]  much, not over the top, make it safe, said Elizabeth. I can't read her last name. I'm
[17:39.820 --> 17:43.660]  sorry. It's long. This is the first step in regulation for the edibles industry.
[17:44.620 --> 17:47.340]  This is a good idea, you guys, but something I wanted to bring up,
[17:48.700 --> 17:54.140]  this is going to crush a couple of companies, I'm sure, because this came up quickly and it had to
[17:54.140 --> 17:58.780]  happen. I think it went into effect on the first of this month and they didn't get a lot of time.
[17:58.780 --> 18:03.260]  People had to pull product that they have already made, already have packaged,
[18:03.260 --> 18:07.420]  they had to pull it all off the shelf. And then they had to repackage it, or I don't know if
[18:07.420 --> 18:10.860]  they were even allowed to repackage it because if the pieces weren't properly labeled, they had to
[18:10.860 --> 18:16.060]  destroy those candy bars. So I'm certain that this put at least one or two small businesses
[18:16.060 --> 18:19.020]  out of business because of these new regulations they keep pushing on us.
[18:20.460 --> 18:28.140]  I kind of agree with the whole situation because, well, I work at the dispensary and I hang out with
[18:28.140 --> 18:32.620]  people that work there all day and we insist to people just take this and they laugh like they're
[18:32.620 --> 18:38.300]  going to be able, like they're Superman. And they don't realize what they're buying is proper.
[18:38.300 --> 18:42.140]  They're used to buying brownies that their cousin made or that their stoner uncle made and they
[18:42.140 --> 18:45.260]  weren't that potent. So they're buying these medical edibles and they're just getting...
[18:45.260 --> 18:48.220]  Or they're rec edibles, but I mean, they're made by the same people that make medical.
[18:48.780 --> 18:51.820]  They're buying these quality edibles and they're just getting fucked up.
[18:51.820 --> 18:54.860]  So I kind of like the idea that we're marking them each piece, but
[18:54.940 --> 19:00.380]  I'm sure it's hard for a business to keep itself going when every month there's a new regulation.
[19:00.380 --> 19:04.060]  They're like, oh, you guys put all those stripes on the package. Now you have to put the stripes
[19:04.060 --> 19:08.540]  plus a hologram. So that's going to crush somebody. All right, let's get into another
[19:08.540 --> 19:14.300]  news article because that one is boring as shit. This one is from The Cannabis. What's up to The
[19:14.300 --> 19:18.860]  Cannabis? Everybody's read a lot of their stuff. This article is by David Magoya. He's a writer
[19:19.820 --> 19:26.300]  for the Denver Post. The headline says, Oregon's M Bank pulls out of Colorado a week after taking
[19:26.300 --> 19:30.460]  on pot accounts. A lot of you are going to say what, but I'll catch you up to speed.
[19:30.460 --> 19:35.340]  It says, the Oregon Community Bank that a week ago openly welcomed Colorado marijuana industry
[19:35.340 --> 19:39.580]  customers has changed its mind, publicly saying it doesn't have the infrastructure to handle the
[19:39.580 --> 19:44.540]  overwhelming response for service. But people familiar with the move say the retreat was
[19:44.540 --> 19:49.020]  pressed by federal banking regulators who stepped in late last week to tell M Bank executives that
[19:49.020 --> 19:54.860]  crossing several states to work with an industry that remains illegal under federal law was simply
[19:54.860 --> 20:00.300]  too risky. Following national press, the volume of inquiries in Oregon, Washington, and Colorado
[20:00.300 --> 20:05.660]  has been so overwhelming that we don't currently have the infrastructure to adequately support all
[20:05.660 --> 20:11.340]  of these customers. M Bank CEO Jeff Baker said Monday, Colorado is the furthest from our market
[20:11.340 --> 20:16.140]  area and the most difficult to provide the quality customer service to. There are nearly
[20:16.140 --> 20:22.220]  2,200 pot retail manufacturing and grow businesses in Colorado, according to the state licensing data.
[20:22.220 --> 20:26.940]  The bank will continue to serve legal marijuana businesses in Oregon and Washington, Baker said.
[20:26.940 --> 20:31.740]  Industry insiders said the pullback was not unexpected. We've become accustomed to our
[20:31.740 --> 20:36.060]  banking solutions not actually working out, said Michael Elliott, executive director of the
[20:36.060 --> 20:41.820]  marijuana industry group. After they got all that press, I was wondering if they'd get
[20:41.820 --> 20:47.260]  increased scrutiny and pressure as a result, just like all the other banks have. Part of the issue,
[20:47.260 --> 20:53.660]  Baker said, was M Bank's lack of a Colorado branch, which would require approval from the
[20:53.660 --> 20:58.540]  state banking authorities. It did not need approval to accept deposits from Colorado businesses.
[20:59.340 --> 21:02.540]  So they're just searching for loopholes to not want to do business with us. All right, it says,
[21:02.540 --> 21:07.900]  without branch cash deposits, millions of dollars that often must be treated with cleaners, such as
[21:07.900 --> 21:13.660]  Febreze, to remove the pungent marijuana smell would have to be made at a federal reserve bank,
[21:13.660 --> 21:18.700]  such as one located in downtown Denver. From there, deposits would be electronically credited
[21:18.700 --> 21:24.460]  to M Bank's accounts, then to its marijuana business depositors. Founded in 1995,
[21:24.460 --> 21:31.180]  the $165 million bank has three Oregon locations in and around Portland. It nearly closed in 2009,
[21:31.180 --> 21:36.780]  following a string of problems that ranged from inadequate board management to a balance sheet
[21:36.780 --> 21:41.420]  weighed... God, I can't even read that. I'm sorry, you guys. That ranged from inadequate board
[21:41.420 --> 21:46.060]  management to a balance sheet weighed down by toxic and poorly performing loans. That was hard
[21:46.060 --> 21:50.460]  to say, dude. I'm going to take a dab here after this article, trust me. All right, Baker said the
[21:50.460 --> 21:55.820]  five Colorado-based marijuana business accounts that were open will most likely be closed. I'm
[21:55.820 --> 22:02.300]  not 100% on that, but we're reviewing it. Another 60 inquiries from Colorado pot shop owners will be
[22:02.300 --> 22:07.580]  shelved, he said. When M Bank went public with its desire to bank the marijuana sector last week,
[22:07.580 --> 22:12.860]  its brazenness raised industry eyebrows. Banking regulators, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance
[22:12.860 --> 22:18.380]  Corporation, which oversees M Bank, have frowned on institutions that are overt about working with
[22:18.380 --> 22:23.820]  legal cannabis businesses. Colorado's legal pot businesses have long lamented that their accounts
[22:23.820 --> 22:30.140]  are closed as soon as... Okay, as soon as where they are banking becomes public. That was odd.
[22:30.780 --> 22:35.020]  This is exactly the reason why the marijuana industry cannot say who they have a bank account
[22:35.020 --> 22:39.500]  with and why the banks don't want it public, Elliot said. Baker sidestepped the question
[22:39.500 --> 22:45.260]  about whether the FDIC, the agency he said offered its tactic approval to the idea only a week ago,
[22:45.260 --> 22:50.860]  that pushed M Bank out of Colorado. We are regulated by the government and the expectation
[22:50.860 --> 22:55.340]  is that we run our bank in a safe and sound manner. In the event we don't, we face severe
[22:55.340 --> 22:59.980]  repercussions from our regulators, Baker said. Certainly regulators influence our decisions,
[22:59.980 --> 23:04.300]  but it ultimately is our call. So they were definitely coerced into it by the FDIC.
[23:05.420 --> 23:08.860]  The feds don't want cannabis money. They don't want us to be able to bank, I think.
[23:11.340 --> 23:15.420]  All right, I'll continue with the article. Sorry, I needed a drink. Others familiar with the outcome
[23:15.420 --> 23:19.820]  of the FDIC frowned at the public nature of M Bank's move, making it unclear whether the plan
[23:19.820 --> 23:25.740]  would have met approval had it not been so well publicized. The regulators have the gun and all
[23:25.740 --> 23:30.300]  the bullets, said one banking insider who's familiar with the FDIC and its methods. Any of
[23:30.300 --> 23:34.940]  us who have survived the financial crisis knows exactly how this works. If we're not team players,
[23:34.940 --> 23:41.100]  our life becomes miserable. Colorado has had several efforts at banking the marijuana industry
[23:41.740 --> 23:46.300]  go awry. The most recent, a long delay in the opening of the fourth corner credit union,
[23:46.300 --> 23:49.980]  the world's first credit union created specifically for the pot industry had expected
[23:49.980 --> 23:54.620]  to open at the new year, but it has not yet been granted a master account by the Federal Reserve
[23:54.620 --> 24:00.220]  Bank in Kansas City. So they're already two months, almost three months behind in getting
[24:00.220 --> 24:04.940]  that open because the feds don't want us to put our money in the banks so that we can have it on
[24:04.940 --> 24:08.780]  us when they rate us. That's why they can take it all from us. All right, I'll keep reading.
[24:08.780 --> 24:15.740]  A move last year by the Colorado legislature set the stage for a banking cooperative similar to a
[24:15.740 --> 24:20.860]  credit union, but has made no progress despite numerous discussions. That's because it too would
[24:20.860 --> 24:26.380]  require the same master account necessary to access the nation's money system. Colorado Springs State
[24:26.380 --> 24:31.420]  Bank, the last Colorado bank to openly work with the marijuana industry closed about 300 accounts
[24:31.420 --> 24:37.260]  in late 2011 amid concerns of working with companies that violate federal law. Baker said
[24:37.260 --> 24:42.300]  he'll likely revisit the Colorado plan, but it might take some time. The position of state and
[24:42.300 --> 24:47.020]  federal regulators is that they do not object to banking services being provided to the cannabis
[24:47.020 --> 24:51.740]  industry, he said. However, they absolutely expect the development of strong programs.
[24:51.740 --> 24:57.580]  Time and experience will allow programs to become stronger. It doesn't sound like they want to work
[24:57.580 --> 25:02.140]  with us at all to tell you the truth. These dispensaries are making a lot of money and
[25:02.140 --> 25:09.020]  without having a bank, I see how difficult it can be because other businesses don't want to be paid
[25:09.020 --> 25:15.820]  in cash. Whatever businesses are attached to your dispensary, you have to have a security
[25:15.820 --> 25:19.900]  guard all day long, so you have to pay for security service. The security service does not want to be
[25:19.900 --> 25:25.020]  paid in cash. All of the dispensary customers paid in cash. So now the dispensary is sitting
[25:25.020 --> 25:30.140]  on a shit ton of cash. They have to turn that into some sort of currency that they can pay
[25:30.140 --> 25:34.380]  the electricity, they got to pay payroll, they've got to pay the accountant, they got to pay the
[25:34.380 --> 25:38.780]  lawyer, they've got to pay the employees, they got to pay the master grower, they got to buy nutrients.
[25:39.740 --> 25:43.340]  So it's a pain in the ass to deal with this because I'm going to press pause for a second.
[25:43.340 --> 25:45.740]  I'm going to take a drink and a dab and I'll be right back with you. Hold on.
[25:46.460 --> 25:48.860]  All right, guys, thanks for letting me get a quick drink. I needed that. It was getting all
[25:48.860 --> 25:52.300]  dried out. I got a couple more news articles and then we're going to get to the part that everyone's
[25:52.300 --> 25:57.980]  waiting for. I'm going to give away some prizes, some prizes. Just bear with me through a couple
[25:57.980 --> 26:01.900]  more articles. I'm building up suspense, that's all. I've got another article in a minute that's
[26:01.900 --> 26:05.660]  going to come from my hometown, so that's a little bit interesting. I'm going to click over and see
[26:05.660 --> 26:10.540]  how long we've been going at this. 25 minutes. Yeah. A couple more articles and I'll give away
[26:10.540 --> 26:16.060]  the prizes and I'll get out of here and let you guys get back onto your day. Let's see. This
[26:16.060 --> 26:22.540]  article is from Ricardo Baca from The Cannabis. Once again, it says $573 million in pot sales.
[26:22.540 --> 26:28.860]  Here are 12 stats that define the year in marijuana. So a couple episodes ago,
[26:28.860 --> 26:33.020]  Spence and Maddie came on and we talked about the year in review. And then in episode 50,
[26:33.020 --> 26:37.740]  we talked about Live Resin being one of the big dicks of the year. The Cannabis went and put
[26:37.740 --> 26:42.700]  together their 12 stats of the year. I'll read most of these. I probably won't read all 12 of
[26:42.700 --> 26:48.700]  them because I want to get to the prizes, you guys. The first one says, number one, 130.3 metric
[26:48.700 --> 26:56.060]  tons. That's Colorado's annual demand for marijuana equal to 36.8 million eighths of cannabis flower.
[26:56.860 --> 27:04.700]  So every year Colorado sells and or smokes 36.8 million eighths. That's a lot of eighths.
[27:06.140 --> 27:11.820]  If you're buying them at a shop, that's averaging you about 65 to $70 an eighth. That's a lot of
[27:11.820 --> 27:18.380]  freaking money we're bringing in. It says, makes you wonder how many Coloradoans use regularly.
[27:18.940 --> 27:25.740]  The answer to that is 485,000. That's the number of adults who are 21 and older using marijuana
[27:25.740 --> 27:30.780]  regularly, which they account for at least once a month. And it's about 9% of the state's
[27:30.780 --> 27:36.700]  population. And then it says, and what about those using more often than that? 23%. That's
[27:37.500 --> 27:42.700]  the amount of Colorado's user population that consumes cannabis nearly daily. So if you're
[27:42.700 --> 27:49.260]  in my club, 23% of us, we're in the 23 club. We smoke cannabis on a daily basis. But what about
[27:49.260 --> 27:56.140]  the out-of-state tourists visiting Colorado that purchase legal weed? 90%. That's the amount of
[27:56.140 --> 28:02.220]  recreational pot sales out-of-state tourists are responsible for at shops in mountain town resort
[28:02.220 --> 28:08.700]  communities. So they're saying places like Breck and Vale, 90% of pot sales are from out-of-state
[28:08.700 --> 28:14.300]  tourists. In my neighborhood, in our area, what we have observed, I'm going to say about 70%
[28:14.300 --> 28:20.620]  of the people that stop into the spot dispensary are from out-of-state. And I'm going to say 50%
[28:20.620 --> 28:26.620]  of the people are from Texas. That's just what we have observed being in the place a lot.
[28:27.580 --> 28:33.100]  The next one says, but how much of Colorado's annual demand are these tourists actually buying?
[28:33.100 --> 28:38.060]  7%. That's the amount of Colorado's annual pot demand purchased by out-of-state tourists.
[28:39.020 --> 28:46.460]  9% is the price drop on a recreational eighth of marijuana at a dozen prominent Colorado shops
[28:46.460 --> 28:58.380]  since the 1st of January. So an eighth has gone from $53.88 to $48.95 is how much the prices have
[28:58.380 --> 29:01.980]  dropped. I'm going to skip over a couple of these because they're just ridiculous numbers.
[29:02.460 --> 29:15.500]  So, geez, is that 200 and... Has that a million? Okay. $246,810,599.03 is the state's total
[29:15.500 --> 29:22.220]  recreational marijuana sales as counted from January to October because November and December
[29:22.220 --> 29:27.340]  data was not available at the time of this article from the Colorado Department of Revenue.
[29:27.340 --> 29:34.620]  So $246 million, you guys, that's nine digits. You got your hundreds, you got your thousands,
[29:34.620 --> 29:37.260]  your hundred thousand, your 10,000, your hundred thousand. Then you got these
[29:37.820 --> 29:43.900]  other three digits over here. There's two commas in that sets of money. That's a lot of damn money.
[29:43.900 --> 29:54.140]  So of course, you're going to ask, what about total medical sales? 326,716,273.59.
[29:54.540 --> 30:00.220]  Can you guys fathom that much money? That's nine digits. That's a lot of money, dude.
[30:01.100 --> 30:06.460]  That's Colorado's total medical marijuana sales also from January to October.
[30:07.340 --> 30:19.980]  Somebody do some math on that. That's $572 million, dude. $572 million we made
[30:19.980 --> 30:27.580]  on cannabis, legal cannabis sales. Gosh, that's a lot of money. Imagine where that was going before
[30:27.580 --> 30:31.420]  we had legalized cannabis. Of course, a lot of it is coming from out of state people and stuff,
[30:31.420 --> 30:36.620]  but imagine where that money was going before we had legalized cannabis. Where was that going? What
[30:36.620 --> 30:44.060]  was happening with it? So the next number is 103,918. That's the number of medical marijuana
[30:44.060 --> 30:49.820]  patients reporting severe pain as their condition for a license, or 94% of the state's total
[30:49.820 --> 30:57.020]  patients are using severe pain as their condition. How can you deny severe pain? If you go to the
[30:57.020 --> 31:00.620]  doctor and you say, it hurts, he's going to go, I believe you because he's a doctor and he's
[31:00.620 --> 31:08.220]  compassionate. So hell yeah, use that one. It hurts. Pick a spot and say it hurts. $600 or $60.1
[31:08.220 --> 31:14.780]  million. That's the amount Colorado has brought in via taxes, licenses, and fees on recreational
[31:14.780 --> 31:20.060]  and medical marijuana. I'm not going to say marijuana, recreational and medical cannabis
[31:20.060 --> 31:26.940]  from January to October. So $60.1 million has been brought into the state of Colorado
[31:26.940 --> 31:32.780]  just from taxes, licenses, and fees. Nothing was sold and no product passed hands that way,
[31:32.780 --> 31:41.420]  simply licensing and taxing people. $60.1 million. Oh my goodness. All right. What about the cannabis
[31:41.420 --> 31:45.660]  infused edibles, the cookies and gummies and brownies that proved to be surprisingly popular
[31:45.660 --> 31:51.020]  in this first year of recreational sales? And then the answer is 10 milligrams of THC. That's the
[31:51.020 --> 31:56.780]  state's standard single serving size for marijuana edibles with a hundred milligrams maximum allowed
[31:56.780 --> 32:04.140]  in an individually packaged product being sold recreationally. A hundred milligram incredible
[32:04.140 --> 32:08.700]  bar is fine. There's nothing, you don't need more than that. If you're from out of state and you're
[32:08.700 --> 32:11.980]  coming here and you're going to buy a hundred milligram edible, you're good. Don't eat that
[32:11.980 --> 32:17.900]  whole thing. I see that that is a decent amount. A hundred milligrams is a good limit. And you can
[32:17.900 --> 32:22.460]  buy multiple of those because if you're out of state, you're allowed up to seven grams of cannabis.
[32:22.460 --> 32:26.620]  You're allowed to divide that into milligrams. However many milligrams are in that candy bar,
[32:26.620 --> 32:32.940]  you can get that many. So here's a neat fact that says, and did any of these edibles end up making
[32:32.940 --> 32:37.820]  for a crazy Halloween? As some thought they would. And then the response is zero. That's the number of
[32:37.820 --> 32:42.700]  reports of THC laced candy given to trick or treaters on Halloween, regardless of widespread
[32:42.700 --> 32:47.180]  concern that legal marijuana would lead to pot laced candies in children's Halloween hauls.
[32:48.540 --> 32:53.580]  Yeah. Nobody got ganja edibles because they're expensive. And because if you bought it,
[32:53.580 --> 32:58.460]  you probably ate it yourself and didn't want to give it to some kid. So those are 12 interesting
[32:58.460 --> 33:05.020]  facts, statistics, I guess they are from the state of Colorado for the first year of legal cannabis.
[33:05.580 --> 33:11.500]  I've got one more article. This comes from, part of this happened in my hometown in the lovely,
[33:11.500 --> 33:19.580]  lovely town of Pueblo, Colorado. This is why I have said stop shipping cannabis,
[33:20.300 --> 33:24.940]  because this dude got caught and he is going to get fucked. And then he'll probably get fucked
[33:24.940 --> 33:29.740]  after that, but I'm not going to go there. The article is from the cannabis and it says,
[33:29.820 --> 33:37.500]  police found $63,000 in marijuana and pot products in a UPS package. And then the headline is Pueblo
[33:37.500 --> 33:43.820]  police, Texas man arrested after trying to ship 63 K of marijuana. There's a picture of a table
[33:44.620 --> 33:50.060]  with, it looks like this dude has a bunch of eights and they're rolled up. Oh no, those are
[33:50.060 --> 33:53.660]  probably ounces. Those are ounces. It looks like I'm trying to zoom in here. He's got ounces and
[33:53.660 --> 33:57.340]  they're wrapped up. And then those ounces are all shoved into bags. And it looks like he's got one,
[33:57.420 --> 34:02.540]  two, three, four of those ounces per bag. And then he's got one, two, three, four, five.
[34:02.540 --> 34:06.220]  They're like eight of them on the table and whatever I just pushed made the thing refresh.
[34:06.220 --> 34:11.020]  But yeah, he's got several pounds there. And then there's another picture of a bunch of edibles.
[34:11.660 --> 34:16.620]  There's a monkey bar on there, which was one of my favorite edibles. There's a bunch of really
[34:16.620 --> 34:21.500]  popular edibles. There's some Mahatma concentrates. So it looks like this dude was trying to send the
[34:21.500 --> 34:26.780]  goods back to Texas and let's read about what happened to him. This article is by Jesse Paul
[34:26.780 --> 34:31.340]  from the Denver Post. I found it on the Cannabis. It says a Texas man was arrested Wednesday on
[34:31.340 --> 34:37.180]  suspicion of trying to send himself an estimated $63,000 in marijuana and marijuana products.
[34:37.180 --> 34:44.540]  Some of which was legally purchased from Pueblo back home. And I'm curious because they say $63,000.
[34:46.060 --> 34:50.300]  Is that Texas price or was that the price at the dispensary when he bought it? Or is that street
[34:50.300 --> 34:55.820]  price or is that DEA markup price? I'm curious. Should I say this guy's name? I don't want to say
[34:55.820 --> 34:58.700]  his name. I'll read his name in the article. I don't want to because that makes him popular. He's
[34:58.700 --> 35:03.980]  going to get credit. Johnny Wolf was arrested by the San Angelo police department in Texas at his
[35:03.980 --> 35:09.500]  residence and is being held at the Tom Green County jail in lieu of a hundred thousand dollars
[35:09.500 --> 35:14.540]  cash only bond. Pueblo police said Wolf has been charged with possession of marijuana with intent
[35:14.540 --> 35:20.460]  to distribute. Here's where the article gets interesting to me. Police in Pueblo began
[35:20.460 --> 35:25.020]  investigating investigating Wolf early last month after United Parcel Service employees
[35:25.020 --> 35:30.140]  reported receiving a package that was suspicious. The package was sent by Wolf out of Pueblo to
[35:30.140 --> 35:36.460]  himself at an address in San Angelo, Texas. I want to know what makes a package suspicious
[35:36.460 --> 35:42.060]  because they show a picture of this guy and this dude's got long hair and he looks like he'd be a
[35:42.060 --> 35:45.580]  rowdy Texas troublemaker. Sorry, dude. I just called you out, but you do, man. You got that
[35:45.580 --> 35:49.740]  long hair. I got dreadlocks too, bro. I know what it's like, but you look like fucking trouble.
[35:49.740 --> 35:55.180]  I wonder if that was all it took to make him suspicious. That and the fact that he sent the
[35:55.180 --> 36:00.940]  package to himself in Texas. He's like, I'm Justin Wolf and I want to send this to Justin Wolf. That
[36:00.940 --> 36:06.460]  might've been it, but I'll keep reading. It says inside police found several double vacuum sealed
[36:06.460 --> 36:11.340]  packages with a total of nine pounds of high grade marijuana. Police said investigators say the
[36:11.340 --> 36:16.060]  package also had cannabis edibles, cough syrup, skin patches, and wax concentrate that had been
[36:16.060 --> 36:22.380]  legally purchased from two separate dispensaries in Pueblo, Colorado. Police estimate the marijuana
[36:22.380 --> 36:28.780]  to be worth $58,000 and the cannabis products worth to be $5,000. Pueblo police say they drafted a
[36:28.780 --> 36:34.060]  warrant on Tuesday for Wolf's arrest and contacted police in Texas who arrested him. I actually read
[36:34.060 --> 36:41.260]  this article somewhere else. They said that they already have a team in Texas that works on this.
[36:41.260 --> 36:44.620]  So the way they just called their bros, you know, Hey, we got another one guys. And they
[36:44.620 --> 36:50.220]  would just went and picked him up. So my point, the reason I'm reading this article, stop shipping
[36:50.220 --> 36:54.140]  things out of state. You guys are it up for Colorado. We've got a good thing here. If you
[36:54.140 --> 36:57.740]  want some weed, come get it and enjoy it while you're here. If you want weed while you're at
[36:57.740 --> 37:04.620]  home in Texas or North Carolina or Alabama or Arkansas, do what you got to do to make cannabis
[37:04.620 --> 37:09.420]  legal there. Don't come here and mail yourself some shit to your state and it up for us.
[37:09.420 --> 37:13.260]  And you're it up for yourself because you're going to go to jail and you're thwarting your
[37:13.260 --> 37:17.020]  legalization efforts in your own place. You could have spent that energy, that time and that money
[37:17.020 --> 37:22.460]  legalizing cannabis where you are. That's my rant on that. Don't, don't send shit in the mail, dude.
[37:22.460 --> 37:28.060]  It's dumb. This guy is going to go to prison and he's got long hair and he's a skinny white dude.
[37:28.060 --> 37:33.340]  I, he will not do well in prison. We're the same build. I don't want to go to prison. It's not
[37:33.340 --> 37:38.460]  going to be fun. Don't ship some shit. You guys. All right. I'll quit bitching at you about shipping
[37:38.460 --> 37:40.860]  shit. Cause most of the people that listen to the show, aren't the people that are going to
[37:40.860 --> 37:46.380]  ship some stuff anyway. So I'll quit bitching at you. I guess it is time to get to the fun part.
[37:46.380 --> 37:49.900]  Let's see how long the show has been going. We're 37 minutes in and I haven't given out any prizes
[37:49.900 --> 37:55.340]  yet. Oh my God. Let's do this. All right. I read that part. I read that part. I read that part.
[37:55.340 --> 37:59.260]  Here we go. Let's get to this paper. Are you guys ready for this? Somebody answer me. All right.
[38:00.620 --> 38:05.180]  So on episode 50, we gave some instructions on how you guys could win some great prizes.
[38:06.140 --> 38:13.900]  I'm going to go from the bottom here. Um, on Instagram, I posted an Irie hat pin. So this,
[38:13.900 --> 38:17.260]  these are, I'm just going to do it kind of quickly. These are the Instagram prize winners
[38:17.900 --> 38:25.820]  going from the bottom. The Irie hat pin was won by not you again, 83. Irie hat pin,
[38:25.820 --> 38:32.140]  not you again, 83 from Instagram. The highly educated titanium t-shirt was won by logistics.
[38:32.780 --> 38:36.460]  The white Irie genetics t-shirt enlarge. The winner is Bob rennet.
[38:37.500 --> 38:43.900]  The black Irie genetics t-shirt and extra large is won by dabbing mile high, the garden of weed
[38:43.900 --> 38:48.860]  and package, which features a sweet pendant by ghost cat glass, the garden of weed and t-shirt
[38:48.860 --> 38:54.780]  and some stickers that is one by Rasta Ralph. Congratulations. Rasta Ralph. I will say this
[38:54.780 --> 38:59.900]  guys. Rasta Ralph is a friend of ours. I know him, but the contest said, uh, put a reason why you
[38:59.900 --> 39:03.980]  should win this. And honestly, Rasta Ralph wrote the best reason why he should win that prize,
[39:03.980 --> 39:09.260]  dude. So Rasta Ralph wins. Um, our second prize winner. This is the one that is going to be
[39:09.260 --> 39:14.060]  exciting. The second prize winner on Instagram. This is the nutrient package without the grokashi
[39:14.060 --> 39:18.860]  and the OGT. This is the second prize, not the grand prize you guys. So the winner of this second
[39:18.860 --> 39:25.260]  prize package from Instagram is Nate McVillain. So congratulations to all of my Instagram winners,
[39:25.260 --> 39:31.020]  Nate McVillain, Rasta Ralph, dabbing mile high, Bob rennet, logistics, and not you again, 83.
[39:31.020 --> 39:36.780]  Here's what you do to claim your prize. I need you to email me at grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[39:36.780 --> 39:41.500]  Tell me your Instagram name. So I know who the hell you are. Give me your real name and your
[39:41.500 --> 39:46.860]  mailing address. And I will get these prizes to you as soon as I can. And maybe it's going to be a
[39:46.860 --> 39:49.740]  little bit, cause I'm going to try to mail all of them at once. So I don't have to keep going to
[39:49.740 --> 39:55.100]  the post office. But as soon as you guys give me all your info, I can get all the packages out.
[39:55.100 --> 40:00.860]  So Nate McVillain, Rasta Ralph, dabbing mile high, Bob rennet, logistics, and not you again, 83.
[40:00.860 --> 40:04.380]  Send me your mailing information. Congratulations. You've got some prizes coming to you.
[40:04.940 --> 40:08.940]  All right, now let's do the Facebook winners. If you guys enter the contest on Facebook,
[40:08.940 --> 40:14.220]  you should be paying attention. The IRIE genetics hat pin will go to Mr. Stuart Coleman.
[40:14.940 --> 40:19.020]  The large IRIE genetics t-shirt goes to my friend, Jake Henry. I don't know Jake,
[40:19.020 --> 40:25.260]  but he's my friend now. The extra large t-shirt goes to Jason Box. The second place prize. This
[40:25.260 --> 40:31.580]  is the prize package without the Grokashi and the OGT. This has, I don't remember what's in there.
[40:31.580 --> 40:34.460]  I'm not going to try to rattle it off. There's stickers, there's nutrients. There's a whole
[40:34.460 --> 40:40.540]  bunch of heavy 16 shit in there. It's a great prize package. The winner is Fred Garvin is the
[40:40.540 --> 40:46.540]  winner of the second place prize package from Facebook. So Fred Garvin, Jason Box, Jake Henry,
[40:46.540 --> 40:52.220]  and Stuart Coleman, please email me, growfromyourheartathotmail.com. I've already got
[40:52.220 --> 40:56.860]  your real name here. Just tell me who you are, give me your name and a shipping address where I
[40:56.860 --> 41:01.100]  can send these packages to, and I will get them to you. Don't worry about where I'm shipping it,
[41:01.100 --> 41:05.500]  because honestly, this is all just grow merchandise or grow equipment, merchandise,
[41:05.500 --> 41:10.140]  gifts. There will not be any IRIE genetic seeds in here. I promise you. We just read an article
[41:10.140 --> 41:13.820]  about shipping shit. I think seeds would be just as bad, probably get me in just as much trouble.
[41:14.780 --> 41:19.340]  So you guys want to know who won the grand prize, right? How do I build suspense? I just go,
[41:20.300 --> 41:25.500]  before I tell you what's in there, there's a bag of OGT. There's a big ass bag of GrowKashi.
[41:25.500 --> 41:29.500]  There are so many bottles of nutrients. There's a bottle of plant catalyst.
[41:30.380 --> 41:35.820]  There's a whole bunch of heavy 16 stuff in there. There are IRIE genetics stickers in there.
[41:36.940 --> 41:43.340]  There is a t-shirt in there. It is heavy. It's going to cost me a lot of money to ship it. So
[41:43.420 --> 41:47.340]  you're lucky I put all that stuff in one prize package. I'm going to do a drum roll on the table
[41:47.340 --> 41:52.540]  here. I don't know if you can hear me. The winner of the grand prize package that was donated to us
[41:52.540 --> 41:57.100]  by our good friends at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies in Denver and Pueblo, make sure you

[42:35.260 --> 42:39.260]  I feel bad. I don't like doing contests because that means that somebody didn't win
[42:39.260 --> 42:45.340]  and I feel like shit for that. So if you didn't win, I'm sorry. I feel guilty already. So don't
[42:45.340 --> 42:48.860]  feel bad that you didn't win. It was hard to pick winners. I only had so many prizes and I had a lot
[42:48.860 --> 42:53.820]  of entries. Thank you to everybody that entered the contest. That means a lot to me. Thank you to
[42:53.820 --> 43:00.140]  everybody that listened to the podcast. Episode 50 got more listens than any other show and it pushed
[43:00.140 --> 43:07.260]  us up to 888 in the Stitcher ranks. There are 25,000 shows on Stitcher and this little show
[43:07.260 --> 43:14.700]  that happens here in my kitchen at my dining room table has placed 888 out of 25,000 shows.
[43:14.700 --> 43:18.700]  So I'm kind of proud. It's not me that did that. It's you guys because I don't listen to it. I just
[43:18.700 --> 43:22.940]  produce it and record it and talk into a mic. So thank you guys for doing that. That is super
[43:22.940 --> 43:27.820]  awesome. You guys make sure you email me, Rich email me, Fred Garvin, Jason Box, Jake Henry,
[43:27.820 --> 43:32.540]  Nate McVillain, Rasta Ralph, Dabin Mile High, Bob Rennet, Logistics, not you again, 83.
[43:33.420 --> 43:39.260]  Please email me. Also, there was an extra prize package that I did not list. I'm going to make
[43:39.260 --> 43:42.300]  sure. I'm going to look over there one more time because I realized that there's another prize pack.
[43:42.300 --> 43:47.580]  I'm going to look. I'm going to peek across the room. There are four bags over there, you guys,
[43:47.580 --> 43:54.380]  and I only gave away three of them. So that meant that I had an extra bag and that extra bag has
[43:54.380 --> 44:00.460]  heavy 16 nutrients. There's iRegenetic stickers in there. There's heavy 16 stickers. There's
[44:00.460 --> 44:06.460]  random shit from Hygro and their growing supplies. And I would like to give that bag to El Rocho.
[44:08.380 --> 44:13.180]  He entered his comment on Instagram. So El Rocho, bro, I need your contact information. Also,
[44:13.740 --> 44:17.420]  you won the prize that I forgot to list because you commented on the nutrient package.
[44:18.060 --> 44:21.420]  And since there's another one, bro, you get it. So message me and I'll get that to you. It's
[44:21.420 --> 44:26.220]  growfromyourheartathotmail.com, you guys. I'm talking really fast, huh? I'm going to take a dab.
[44:26.220 --> 44:30.220]  The show is almost over. Let's take a dab together. I had to pause for the last dab because
[44:30.220 --> 44:37.340]  I needed a drink so badly. Get yourselves a dab, guys. I got the email going, so I'm already ahead
[44:37.340 --> 44:44.220]  of you. I'm going to dab some Sativa mix that I made. Shout out to the Garden of Weeden and Spence.
[44:44.940 --> 44:49.260]  Big Mike helped a lot. And Michael, those guys have got me making pretty good hash. Thanks a lot.
[44:50.060 --> 44:56.140]  So we're going to take a dab, wrap up the show. All right. Three, two, one. Let's dab, you guys.
[45:09.010 --> 45:12.210]  It might've been bigger than I wanted to take on the podcast, but we'll be all right.
[45:14.130 --> 45:17.330]  All right. So I'm going to tell one quick story before I wrap it up because I just hit my Hitman
[45:17.330 --> 45:24.610]  rig and it made me think of something. Yesterday, I straight dropped and broke a $300 Hitman Phase
[45:24.610 --> 45:29.250]  2 cake. It hit the table and it just fucking broke. And I know everyone's going, oh my God,
[45:29.250 --> 45:32.930]  really? You broke a $300 rig? Yeah, I did. And I felt like a real dumb ass about it.
[45:33.490 --> 45:37.650]  I kind of had a moment of guilt in my heart for it. And I sat at the table and I was like,
[45:37.650 --> 45:44.050]  you just dropped one of your favorite rigs, dude. And then what do you do? There's broken glass on
[45:44.050 --> 45:48.130]  the table. You can be mad for a minute. You can be brokenhearted, but then you got to grab the
[45:48.130 --> 45:52.130]  broom and the dustpan and sweep up the fucking broken glass. You got to throw that glass in the
[45:52.130 --> 45:57.650]  trash and you got to move on. Right? That's all I could do because it's broken. I can't glue it back
[45:57.650 --> 46:03.730]  together. Duct tape is not going to work. That shit's done. So I had a moment of Zen as I was
[46:03.730 --> 46:09.170]  sweeping up this broken glass. I thought there's so many things that happen in your life that suck
[46:09.170 --> 46:13.890]  and they hurt, or maybe they're good, but you can't cling to things because you could drop
[46:13.890 --> 46:17.410]  that glass at any minute and that shit could break, dude. And you can't put it back together.
[46:17.970 --> 46:22.210]  And sometimes you just got to sweep some shit up, throw it in the trash can and fucking walk away
[46:22.850 --> 46:27.090]  and just move on. So when you have some shit happen to you, just try to learn something and
[46:27.090 --> 46:33.810]  think about it like that because I've been stuck on something and breaking that rig was definitely
[46:33.810 --> 46:38.050]  symbolic in some way to me. And I learned something from it. I just wanted to share that with you guys.
[46:38.050 --> 46:42.610]  I broke a rig and I learned a huge life lesson from it that had nothing to do with the rig itself.
[46:42.610 --> 46:47.810]  I just, this moment of Zen came over me and taught me a huge life lesson. I wanted to share that.
[46:48.450 --> 46:51.010]  Hope you enjoyed it. I hope you learned something from it also. If there's something that you're
[46:51.010 --> 46:55.730]  fucking stuck on that you're clinging to, just let it go, dude. I know it's easier said than done,
[46:55.730 --> 47:00.050]  but I dropped a $300 rig and I swept it up and threw it away. There's nothing we can do about it.
[47:00.850 --> 47:04.770]  Just sometimes you got to sweep some shit up and move on. I didn't get cut from the rig
[47:04.770 --> 47:09.330]  and I had fun hitting it when I hit it. So that's all I could do. With that being said, you guys,
[47:09.330 --> 47:13.010]  now that the show's over, please go to iTunes or Stitcher, go to the iTunes or the Stitcher main
[47:13.010 --> 47:17.570]  page, search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast, find the review section, give me a five-star rating.

[47:21.330 --> 47:24.770]  on the show. Big shout out to all the people that left comments. I read them at the start of the show.
[47:24.770 --> 47:29.090]  I love it. I really love it. Interacting with you guys makes me feel like you're paying attention.
[47:29.090 --> 47:32.610]  It makes it worth my time and effort. Don't forget that the show is available on iTunes,
[47:32.610 --> 47:37.170]  Stitcher, and every single episode is archived on iRegeneticsColorado.com.

[48:17.970 --> 48:21.570]  that's where that money goes. That goes to my 11-year-old little girl. I'm not going to buy a
[48:21.570 --> 48:25.490]  new dab rig. I'm not going to smoke it up. I'm not going to buy a new hat. It's going to my little

[49:50.420 --> 49:54.900]  Long, long time. I'm out of DJ in the dance. Come watch me nice.
[50:17.240 --> 50:20.520]  Welcome back cannabis community. It's time for another episode of the grow from your heart
[50:20.520 --> 50:26.200]  podcast. Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. If you're a new grower, a pro
[50:26.200 --> 50:30.680]  grower, if you're a new smoker, or if you're a veteran dabber, if you're a cannabis activist,
[50:30.680 --> 50:34.120]  or if you're just someone who's curious about the current state of cannabis, this my friends
[50:34.120 --> 50:38.840]  is the podcast for you. I'm your host, Ross DeGeff. And it's time for episode number 53. I'm
[50:38.840 --> 50:42.280]  having a hard time breathing because we just took some fat dabs in this room. Everyone's looking at
[50:42.280 --> 50:47.080]  me like yes, we did. Thanks for joining us guys sitting to my left. We've got King Cola again.
[50:47.080 --> 50:50.920]  Welcome back, bro. Thanks for having me, man. And right kind of in front of me into my left a
[50:50.920 --> 50:54.280]  little bit. I'm going to say like the 11 o'clock position is my new friend, Alan. How you doing,
[50:54.280 --> 50:57.720]  bro? What's going on, man? Nice to meet you. And over here, the guy who I want to call somebody
[50:57.720 --> 51:01.800]  else because I was told somebody else was coming. But my good friend Nick is over here. How's it
[51:01.800 --> 51:06.040]  going? Jay couldn't make it. I promised you guys Jay would be here. But instead of Jay,
[51:06.040 --> 51:11.080]  he sent three minions in his place. That's how important that dude is. He sent me three guys.
[51:11.080 --> 51:13.720]  And we've been sitting here at the table bullshitting for a few minutes. And these guys
[51:13.720 --> 51:18.920]  know they're worms. We're ready to talk. Ready to talk wormage. They got all the worm puns figured
[51:18.920 --> 51:23.400]  out already. These should have heard the worm puns. Before we get too far, guys, I got to give
[51:23.400 --> 51:27.640]  a big thanks to, shout out thanks to Koo and Kat from the Mystic Roots Band. They allow me to play
[51:27.640 --> 51:32.200]  their music at the start of the show. That is cool as shit because playing music on a podcast
[51:32.200 --> 51:36.840]  is expensive. I know that sounds weird, but you got to pay to play people's music on your show.
[51:36.840 --> 51:41.480]  Why do you got to do that, man? Music should be free, free, free, free freedom. Royalties,
[51:41.480 --> 51:46.920]  royalties. We are royalty. We're the kings of cannabis, aren't we? Art is not free anymore.
[51:46.920 --> 51:50.360]  That's true. Art is not. Well, the artist has got to get paid. I guess that's cool. Thanks,
[51:50.360 --> 51:53.800]  Kat and Koot for letting me play their stuff. Oh, you just pulled out a cool surprise.
[51:54.520 --> 52:00.120]  The solventless. That's going to totally interrupt the show. Nice. Lemon headed stranger.
[52:01.400 --> 52:06.920]  Oh, dude, that is terpidelic. Terpidelic. It's trichome heavy, so. Trichome heavy extracts.
[52:08.040 --> 52:11.400]  That smells, man, that totally derailed me. I was going to do an ad for Hygro, but.
[52:11.400 --> 52:15.400]  It's like lemon paint thinner. Yeah, lemon paint thinner.
[52:16.120 --> 52:19.160]  Took a trip to Lowe's to get some grow supplies. Came in with some water hash.
[52:19.160 --> 52:22.440]  Figured out a good way to dab that one. This podcast is brought to you by our good friends

[54:01.720 --> 54:04.600]  I don't have any other distributors because they're the only ones I need because they do
[54:04.600 --> 54:08.520]  it right for me. I think Yankee. Yeah. Yankee's the dude. Yeah. Shout out to Yankee. I hope you
[54:08.520 --> 54:11.880]  listen. He listens sometimes, but we're 50 something in. You can't listen to all of them.
[54:11.880 --> 54:15.160]  He's a real cool dude. Shout out, bro. Hope you hear us. Much respect to all the sponsors.
[54:15.960 --> 54:19.480]  We're going to announce it right now. One of our new sponsors. What's the official name? The Rocky
[54:19.480 --> 54:23.000]  Mountain Worm Company? Yeah. Rocky Mountain Worm Company. This podcast is now brought to you by the
[54:23.000 --> 54:26.760]  Rocky Mountain Worm Company. I don't know what to say yet because I have not written a commercial.
[54:26.760 --> 54:31.560]  What you worming with? Do worm, son. We could go on forever with that, I think. There'll be some
[54:31.560 --> 54:35.240]  cool worm puns going on pretty soon here. But yeah, those guys are going to help me out. They're
[54:35.240 --> 54:39.560]  going to contribute organics and they're going to... Part of their sponsorship, they don't know,
[54:39.560 --> 54:43.320]  but I'm going to sucker them into teaching me how to throw away my bottles and we're going to get
[54:43.320 --> 54:47.960]  me working with all organics that will be supplied by them. So all of my grow equipment will come from
[54:47.960 --> 54:52.360]  Hygro and all of my organic supplies will come from the worm company. We're going to be killing
[54:52.360 --> 54:57.080]  it with a sponsorship help. Sounds like a plan. Yeah. I like it. You guys are... You've changed
[54:57.080 --> 55:01.080]  my growing already. I've been using a lot more Grow Kashi, a lot of worm castings and stuff.
[55:01.080 --> 55:05.160]  And I've got a question about that coming up for you in just a couple of seconds. I think we can
[55:05.160 --> 55:10.040]  almost get to that. Let's see. I said, thanks to everybody. I read the commercials. Yeah, dude,
[55:10.040 --> 55:13.800]  I want to thank you guys for coming. These guys showed up early, dude. Three paw heads showed up
[55:13.800 --> 55:18.840]  to my house early. I was impressed. Yeah, it worked out really well. Yeah. We like pulled
[55:18.840 --> 55:24.600]  up at the same time. Five seconds after we did. Nice, nice. Punctual stoners. So this will be a
[55:24.600 --> 55:28.600]  perfect question since you guys are from the organic side of the growing. I've been talking
[55:28.600 --> 55:33.640]  about Grow Kashi. I actually gave some Grow Kashi away in a prize package recently. And one of my
[55:33.640 --> 55:39.000]  listeners, a lot of the listeners have been asking how to use the Grow Kashi. I read the
[55:39.000 --> 55:42.920]  instructions and it says to fill up your reservoir with however many gallons of water. And then you
[55:42.920 --> 55:47.160]  add a third of a cup of Kashi and then you mix in, I don't remember the specific amount of molasses,
[55:47.160 --> 55:54.040]  but you mix in a specific amount of molasses per gallon. And then you let it sit for 24 to 48 hours.
[55:54.040 --> 55:59.560]  And then that, I use that, excuse my cough guys, we took some gnarly dabs. After that's mixed,
[55:59.560 --> 56:03.880]  I use that and just water into the top of my plants. And I noticed that they love it.
[56:04.520 --> 56:08.760]  Do you guys have other ways that you prefer or recommend? Do you guys want to take that? There's
[56:08.760 --> 56:13.320]  a ton of other ways you can put it in your soil. Hey guys, this is Alan on the mic just so that
[56:13.320 --> 56:19.800]  you know who you're listening to. You can put it in your teas, top dress, you can get your mycelium
[56:19.800 --> 56:24.120]  going on the top layer. With that, sometimes you want to put a mulch down. You don't want to get
[56:24.120 --> 56:28.520]  too dry. So you've got to watch out with that. But definitely have seen results layering it in
[56:28.520 --> 56:34.360]  your pot as you transplant. Okay. So some dirt, then some Kashi, then some dirt, then some Kashi.
[56:35.000 --> 56:39.240]  Whatever you're doing, whatever your organic heart desires. And since you're in there throwing some
[56:39.240 --> 56:44.280]  worm castings, right? Worm castings everywhere. Every time. Everywhere. I've seen a difference in
[56:44.280 --> 56:49.080]  my plants. I've only been using them for a week and my plants, they're more vigorous. They're
[56:49.080 --> 56:53.560]  wanting more water more often because they're growing so much more. It's because they're
[56:53.560 --> 56:59.000]  learning how to eat by themselves. They're starting to cycle nutrients. Basically what
[56:59.000 --> 57:05.320]  you're doing is when you're growing synthetically, you're just bypassing this entire organic life.
[57:05.320 --> 57:09.320]  Yeah. I mean, you're just cutting everything out. So we're just shooting it up. You're
[57:09.320 --> 57:14.120]  forced to feeding it. Exactly. Shortcut through the rhizosphere. Okay. Exactly. As you know,
[57:14.120 --> 57:19.160]  that's actually why hydro growers have to supplement with so much CO2. There's no CO2
[57:19.160 --> 57:24.360]  produced in the decomposition of the soil. I don't have the number in front of me, but I've
[57:24.360 --> 57:28.840]  been doing some research lately, but yeah, there's actually a significant amount of CO2 put off
[57:28.840 --> 57:31.800]  running like a no-till system in larger containers. There's a lot of importance to
[57:31.800 --> 57:39.720]  decomposition. We're taught science, but it's not science. It's all nature. It's been done
[57:39.720 --> 57:44.920]  for thousands of years. Koreans and... And that goes back to the Bokashi.
[57:44.920 --> 57:49.240]  Yeah. Bokashi has been around forever. It's nothing new. It's not rocket science.
[57:49.240 --> 57:51.960]  What's the difference between Bokashi and Grokashi? I'm good on that,
[57:51.960 --> 57:55.000]  Joynton. Here, I'll take a hit because you looked at me like I'm a puss. I'll hit it.
[57:55.000 --> 57:56.680]  I just don't need the cotton mouth on the show here.
[57:57.320 --> 58:03.800]  It's kind of like the Band-Aid brand. Grokashi has kind of taken over the industry like that.
[58:03.800 --> 58:12.760]  Okay. So Grokashi is Bokashi. They are the same thing. It's just Grokashi makes their own
[58:12.760 --> 58:18.280]  mix of Bokashi. Bokashi is nothing but a... A brand.
[58:18.280 --> 58:23.240]  Yeah. Basically it's a brand. It can be any medium. You can use sticks or stems or oat bran,
[58:23.240 --> 58:28.280]  just any sort of carbon-based material. Then you're going to inoculate it with typically
[58:29.000 --> 58:35.320]  yeast, photosynthetic bacteria, and lactic acid bacteria. So that's an EM1 if you're familiar,
[58:35.320 --> 58:37.320]  follow our feeds and stuff. Yeah. And actually I got the...
[58:37.320 --> 58:39.080]  It's pretty important. Probiotic Farmers Alliance stuff.
[58:39.080 --> 58:45.800]  And then if I'm not mistaken, Grokashi actually adds in glacial rock dust for trace minerals.
[58:45.800 --> 58:49.480]  So that's kind of what makes up their mix. Okay.
[58:50.040 --> 58:54.200]  Rocky Mount Worm Company will actually start carrying their own Bokashi here soon.
[58:54.200 --> 58:58.680]  You can add a lot to your Bokashi. And ours will actually be inoculated with
[58:58.680 --> 59:00.920]  humic acid, some local animals. Very cool.
[59:00.920 --> 59:01.880]  So that's some... Wow.
[59:01.880 --> 59:05.640]  Yeah. So basically you'll get a little piece of our gardens in yours. It'll be pretty neat.
[59:05.640 --> 59:07.240]  Nice. A little bit of love spread around.
[59:07.960 --> 59:12.600]  We want to try to keep it local. Rocky Mountain Natural Farm is trying to keep everything in
[59:12.600 --> 59:15.400]  Colorado, bring back to the community. That's really cool.
[59:15.400 --> 59:19.640]  Yeah. Because it's important, especially in the cannabis community to give back to others. And
[59:19.640 --> 59:23.640]  you see it a lot in other states that have been doing it a little longer. Their community is a
[59:23.640 --> 59:27.880]  little bit more integrated up in NorCal, a lot of people...
[59:27.880 --> 59:29.240]  That's how farming should work. Exactly.
[59:29.240 --> 59:30.360]  And this is farming. Exactly.
[59:30.360 --> 59:32.760]  It's a specialized product, but it's definitely farming.
[59:32.840 --> 59:37.560]  It's an artisan product. It goes with anything, with wine, cheese, meats.
[59:40.120 --> 59:41.720]  You should have... Instruments.
[59:41.720 --> 59:47.000]  Instruments, yeah. Computers, cars. You should want the best. And with organic
[59:47.880 --> 59:55.000]  practices, that's what you get. An actual medicine that's pure. You're not smoking anything that
[59:55.000 --> 59:57.160]  shouldn't be in your body. A map and dap.
[59:58.600 --> 01:00:01.000]  Sean just gave me the, yeah, get away from the map and dap.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.880]  It makes me want to get back to the how to use the Grokashi though. I don't want to leave them
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:08.280]  without some sort of answer on that. I was definitely going to come back around.
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:13.160]  I'd definitely try to do that. Yeah. So basically for me personally,
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:16.040]  if you just want me to tell you how I use Grokashi. Yeah, let's hear it because you're
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:21.240]  great at this field. Well, thank you. So basically when I do my
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:27.400]  initial transplant out of a Red Solo cup, the soil mix traditionally, because I make my own soils,
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:33.800]  will have Grokashi in it already or my own form of Bokashi or Grokashi. So it'll have it in the
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:39.160]  soil mix, but I always top dress. Every time I transplant, always top dress. And usually
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:43.800]  it's with a cover crop, a little bit of Grokashi, a little bit of worm castings,
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:48.040]  and then I'll just water it in with a product we carry that's called C-Crop.
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:52.040]  I heard a lot about that. It's amazing. It's basically,
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  it's kind of like fermented seawater. Is that your fish?
[01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:02.120]  No, it's not a fish emulsion. I would say I use this in place traditionally of if you're familiar
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:06.520]  with full power. I kind of use it in the place of that. It's got a lot of fulvic acids, a lot
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:11.720]  of trace minerals, a lot of things that you're not going to get from your basic.
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:16.920]  What you see a lot of coastal growers use. Exactly. We don't have a micronutrient bottle
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:22.600]  to use. So we use a C-Crop, but yeah, so I usually water in with a C-Crop right after that.
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:30.840]  And then we'll roll into, basically after that, it'll be every two weeks, I'll go through and do
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:37.720]  a Grokashi Dreg, which is basically what you're referring to. I do mine a little bit differently.
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:44.920]  So what I like to do is use a grinded herb, traditionally like a Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:53.240]  So I'll use a, take basically, if I'm doing a 10 gallon thing of tea or Grokashi Dreg,
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:58.280]  so I'll take my Dragonfly Earth Medicine. I'll mix it in there, depending on, you know, flower,
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:03.080]  veg, radiant green, or flat flower, dump that in there. If you don't have those, you can use
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:08.280]  alfalfa or kelp. So I dumped that in there. It usually, at whatever recommended rate you're
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:15.880]  going to run a tea with. Then I add in a fourth a cup of, you know, Bokashi per gallon, a fourth
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:23.480]  a cup of worm castings per gallon, and then one teaspoon of, depending on what stage, I'll either
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:29.880]  use molasses or yucca and use some sort of carbohydrate source. And then I seal it up and
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:37.240]  then forget about it. They say like 12 to 24 hours, but in my personal experience, nothing's wrong
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:42.520]  with taking it 14 days. Wow. Okay. I mean, you're fermenting. So yeah, as long as you want it to go
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:47.800]  a little longer. Rule of thumb, if it smells bad, it is bad. Okay. And you're, if you're familiar with
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:54.440]  probiotics, things like that, you'll, you'll start to learn what good ferments are, what bad
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:59.880]  ferments are. So you want that almost sweet, bitter and not funky. Exactly. Okay. Exactly.
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:05.640]  Yeah. Once the, once the fish smell overpowers, then it's funk, right? Yes. Exactly. Okay.
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:09.720]  That makes sense. When you can tolerate it. And then as far as, do you want to seal it up also,
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:14.920]  you said? Yeah. What I usually do is, everybody's probably got a bunch of Panda film laying around
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:19.320]  somewhere. So what I usually do is cut a big square or have a big square Panda film that was
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:25.080]  left over from like a floor door or something I made. And I just lay it over the container and
[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:30.600]  wrap it in string and tie it tight. There you go. That's it. I mean, it's, it doesn't have to be,
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:36.680]  yeah, you know, this is, this is all in my basement at the home. It doesn't really want to
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:41.880]  happen by nature running down a Hill into a big shitty puddle. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. It's not
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:47.640]  fancy. Yeah. So, and the idea is that we're going to try to balance out aerobic and anaerobic
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:53.160]  bacteria in nature both exists. Like you were for the exact reason you were saying things fall on
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:59.640]  the ground, they decay, you have stagnant water, animals dying, hot spots in the ground. So by
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:04.280]  introducing these things on a regular basis, I've, you know, I feel that that's where we're
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:09.400]  kind of getting a biological edge. I see a difference in my plants and I know it's only
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:13.400]  been a couple of weeks, but just feeding them, they're more vigorous. They're ready to grow.
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:18.920]  It's basically, yeah. The, so you've got your protozoa cycle nutrients, your fungal hypha,
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:25.080]  the bacteria content, there's nematodes in there. So you're just getting this. I mean,
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:28.920]  it's funny because, you know, you go to the hydro store and you see that they sell nematodes and you
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:33.720]  see that they sell great white and you see that they sell OG tea and they sell all of these things.
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:38.680]  And it's like, you take some time to go to Rocky Mount worm companies website. You can actually
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:42.600]  look it up and you'll see that all of these things are already in your worm castings.
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.840]  Chris Willis-Gilliams-Miller And you can make your own, you take
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:50.280]  five small scoops of worm castings and a five gallon bucket of water of good clean water,
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:54.760]  reverse osmosis, clean, dechlorinated water and bubble that shit for like 12 hours. And you've
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:57.640]  just made great white. You've made all of those products on the shelf.
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:01.160]  Chris Willis-Gilliams-Miller Exactly. And I will say that if you're new to
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:06.600]  making teas or even if you're familiar with making teas with a worm castings, a lot of people, we use
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:11.880]  like a Lask and humus from General Organics or different things like that. Traditionally, they're
[01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:17.720]  using one cup per gallon. Please don't waste your, like, you're just going to be wasting money and
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:23.400]  you're going to be creating a mess. A fourth of cup per gallon is all you're going to need with Jays.
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:25.240]  No more. Chris Willis-Gilliams-Miller I'm going to write that down because I don't,
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:28.120]  I think I use more to tell you the truth. I have it written down in the row.
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:30.760]  Chris Willis-Gilliams-Miller I mean, and honestly, that's one, I would even go
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:35.880]  one cup per five gallon bucket. Yeah, just to keep it real simple. But yeah, that's, you're
[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:37.160]  going to get every result. Chris Willis-Gilliams-Miller And you got to
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:40.120]  leave some room for foam, you guys, leave room for foam. So it's just going to foam up.
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:42.680]  Chris Willis-Gilliams-Miller And if you do have a problem with the foam,
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:48.120]  you can always add in some sort of like a fat lipid. So you could use like a fish hydroslate,
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:52.200]  it'll take it out. Neem oil, Karaja oil, coconut oil.
[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:54.200]  If I put neem oil in there, how much would I use?
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:57.320]  Chris Willis-Gilliams-Miller Honestly, to take away foam,
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:01.240]  you would just kind of like drip it off your finger out of the bottle and it'll just kind of
[01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:06.760]  go away. Yeah, I would recommend more or less just throwing a, plants love coconuts. I mean,
[01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:09.640]  seriously, coconut water, coconut powder. If you can get into it.
[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:13.800]  Yeah. If you eat them and you, you know, buy them at the supermarket, go ahead and grab an extra one
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:15.240]  and throw it in every so often. Chris Willis-Gilliams-Miller
[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:18.760]  But yeah, I would throw a tea, like if your stuff's foaming up too bad,
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:22.760]  throw a little bit of coconut oil in there. Your plants will like it. Foam will go away. Keep your
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:29.960]  floor nice and clean. If not, buy a drip tray twice the size of your brewer or brew it in like
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:30.920]  a rubber made container. Neem oil.
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:33.480]  Organics can get hands on and a little messy, but don't be afraid.
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:35.560]  Chris Willis-Gilliams-Miller That's the fun part. I used to,
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:40.680]  when I started, I've been through every nutrient line. I miss back in the day, mixing 42 bottles
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:45.160]  of advanced nutrients. It used to be fun. I felt like the mad scientist looking for the perfect
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:47.720]  mix. And now I can do it with my organics with the help of you guys.
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:53.000]  That's how I first started growing was with bottles. And my first grow, I'll admit it,
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:58.840]  I messed those plants up. I feel so bad. And I wish I had went with organics, but I was nervous.
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:05.880]  But now after actually practicing it and going hands on and just diving in, and after reading a
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:11.000]  lot of the books, they help, but you get to the end of them and it's like, this is just life and
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:16.120]  just what has been happening. And it's what you've learned in science class. It's nothing new. It's
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:22.600]  just going a little farther beyond and that's where the Korean farming comes into. And that's
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:29.880]  a little bit more hands on. But once you start somewhere small with worm castings, that's a big
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:31.800]  step in your gardening practice. Tanner Iskra
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:36.120]  If you're trying to get hardcore into it and you want to be completely self-sufficient and we can
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:39.960]  help you do that. I mean, I'm serious. We can help you to where you'll never have to go to the
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:46.440]  hydro store. You'll never have to come to Jay. You'll never have to rely on anybody to grow your
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:51.720]  own plants. But in order to do that, you're going to have to start somewhere. And that somewhere
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:58.680]  is worm castings. And once you start with that base and then you'll start to understand,
[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:05.960]  okay, this is why I'm mixing it in with the soil. This is what they're doing. A lot of stuff starts
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:07.480]  to make sense. So you're going to see like- Chris Stern
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:10.840]  Root growth on your plants after you transplant. How beautiful everything looks.
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:10.920]  Tanner Iskra
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:15.800]  Root bags for this run and they're coming out of the bottoms vigorously. And usually those roots
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:19.160]  that fall out of the holes like that, they die off, but they're still reaching. They're crawling
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:23.320]  around the room on the floor. Like I can find somewhere I'm sure. Like they're stoked about
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:24.200]  life in there. Yeah. Chris Stern
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:25.160]  Little shop of horrors. Tanner Iskra
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:27.720]  That's it. Yeah. Yep. I got huge roots now. Chris Stern
[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:28.040]  Awesome. Tanner Iskra
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:28.600]  Not a bad thing. Chris Stern
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:30.280]  And they're white. They're super, super white. Tanner Iskra
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:32.600]  So glad to hear that. Yeah. Yeah. Nice and fuzzy.
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:32.760]  Tanner Iskra
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:36.760]  Just a little kashi and two applications of worm castings is really all it is.
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:41.480]  And don't be afraid to use the worm castings in the soil mixes. And, you know, when you transplant-
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:43.560]  Chris Stern 10% is what I typically go with
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:49.160]  for my personal. I don't know what you mean. How long does it take for those worm castings to
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:52.680]  become bioavailable to my plants? Tanner Iskra
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:56.680]  I would say theoretically instantaneously. Chris Stern
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:58.280]  Okay. There's no breakdown time. Tanner Iskra
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:03.800]  There's no NPK. So there is a base, an NPK value, but that's not why you're using them.
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:05.160]  Chris Stern So well done. It's my meniscus.
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:09.880]  When you're adding them, the reason that you're going to get, I'm not going to say instant results,
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:15.080]  but results so quick is because when you introduce those, you're not like, it's not like a fertilizer
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:20.680]  that you're waiting to be absorbed by the root. Exactly. It's life. You just dropped a spaceship
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:21.400]  in that soil. Tanner Iskra
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:25.240]  There are little worms in these worm castings, you guys. There are little tiny baby worms in
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:25.560]  the package. Chris Stern
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.720]  You may get some worms in your castings. Tanner Iskra
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:31.400]  That tells you that, that tells me that that shit is alive. If that worm was alive in there,
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:35.800]  they were packaged in Colorado Springs as far as I know. I bought it in Pueblo at Hygro.
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:41.400]  I had it in my car for a day before I even was able to bring it in the house because you can't
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:43.880]  haul in all the gross shit during the day. You got to kind of-
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:45.400]  Chris Stern Yeah. I will say though,
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:50.280]  when purchasing worm castings, the first thing you want to do is seal them. You want to put them in a
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:55.640]  sealed container because they will dry out. And that's one of the worst, you'll waste a lot of
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:10:01.000]  money doing that because once they dry out, then they're no better than anything off a store shelf.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.560]  They're just that packaged stuff at the store that's all dusty.
[01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:04.120]  Tanner Iskra
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:05.160]  Then I can see a difference. Chris Stern
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:06.920]  No one's bought it and now someone came in. Tanner Iskra
[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:08.040]  I like playing with it. Chris Stern
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:09.400]  You feel it. You smell it. You look at it. Tanner Iskra
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:11.800]  I said that on the last episode. I said, they smell so good.
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:12.280]  Chris Stern You could eat them.
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:12.920]  Tanner Iskra
[01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:17.080]  I don't think I would, but I said it smells delicious. And I said that people are going to
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:21.080]  think I'm weird because I said it smells good, but I love that. That's part of why I grow dirt
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:23.480]  stills because I love the smell of good dirt. I'm just a dirt warrior.
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:24.280]  Chris Stern They smell great.
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:25.480]  Tanner Iskra
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:32.040]  I'm from the East Coast and when I came to Colorado, it hurt my soul to not see dirt.
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:34.600]  It's just- Chris Stern
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:36.600]  Yeah, East Coast, we have loamy soils. Tanner Iskra
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:39.320]  Okay. I was going to say there's a lot of dirt here, bro. We got mountains.
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:40.760]  Chris Stern
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:43.400]  Nice coastal loamy soil. Tanner Iskra
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:45.480]  A lot of decomposition trees. Tanner Iskra
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:46.280]  All that water and humidity. Chris Stern
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:47.480]  Vegetation. Tanner Iskra
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:47.720]  Yeah. Tanner Iskra
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:50.520]  A lot of deciduous forests that die off. Chris Stern
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:51.400]  Dust. Tanner Iskra
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:52.120]  Yeah. Chris Stern
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:52.840]  Pueblo. Tanner Iskra
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:53.800]  Pueblo dust. Tanner Iskra
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:54.280]  Clay. Tanner Iskra
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:57.640]  I'm sorry. I haven't been out of Pueblo much here lately.
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:58.840]  Chris Stern Oh, you got to get in the car and go to
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:00.600]  Manitou with us one day. We just go on random trips.
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:01.080]  Tanner Iskra
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:05.080]  I take that back. I've been to Denver a lot. I haven't had any time to stop and enjoy it.
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:06.360]  Chris Stern The best place I've been to was
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:08.200]  Estes Park and I think that's the closest that was.
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:08.280]  Tanner Iskra
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:09.240]  That's a beautiful place. Chris Stern
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:10.040]  It's really nice. Tanner Iskra
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:10.760]  It's a beautiful place. Tanner Iskra
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:14.760]  I am a Manitou junkie though. Anytime I get a chance, it's the Monte Factor.
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:16.360]  Chris Stern Monte Factor and just a little
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:20.360]  walk on Manitou Avenue. Go visit the Poppy Seed. There's a chiropractor up there that charges a
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:21.960]  dollar a minute I think. Tanner Iskra
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:22.840]  What? I need that.
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:23.000]  Chris Stern
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.280]  Yeah, he's awesome. He pops one of my favorite people. He pops her back once a week.
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:26.360]  Tanner Iskra
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.560]  Is he a chiropractor? Chris Stern
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:28.600]  I don't know. Tanner Iskra
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:31.080]  Maybe train him some workouts and stuff. Chris Stern
[01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:35.640]  He talks about cool things. He knows that we work at a dispensary. He knows that that's where
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:36.280]  his patient works. Tanner Iskra
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:38.280]  Big fan of the arcade up there. Chris Stern
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:38.760]  Yeah. Tanner Iskra
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:41.320]  Nothing's better than when you can just cut loose, man.
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:41.560]  Chris Stern
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:43.880]  Shout out to the Manitou Springs. That's an awesome place.
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:44.120]  Tanner Iskra
[01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:44.760]  Keeping it real. Tanner Iskra
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:49.560]  People who don't do hard drugs. How do we cut loose? We go play penny video games.
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:49.720]  Chris Stern
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:51.160]  Yeah. Tanner Iskra
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:54.040]  What our parents used to do in the day. Chris Stern
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:56.680]  Right. We are turning into old people. Tanner Iskra
[01:11:56.680 --> 01:12:01.400]  I say it every day. I'm like, oh my gosh. My back hurts. My knees crack.
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:01.800]  Chris Stern
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:03.880]  Remember when you could get up without making sound effects?
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:04.600]  Tanner Iskra
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:09.000]  Every time I walk up the stairs, I'm like, crack, crack, crack. I need just joint one
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:09.880]  in my hand all day. Chris Stern
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:12.600]  You aren't sneaking up on anybody, bro. Tanner Iskra
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:15.240]  Hey, Alan's coming upstairs. Watch out. Tanner Iskra
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:20.040]  Aside from the drag, we go, I'm just trying to stay on track.
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:20.200]  Chris Stern
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:21.480]  No, it's cool. I like it. Tanner Iskra
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:26.200]  No, I like to let it go a little A-wire. It's like jam band music. If you let it go for a
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:29.640]  minute, some gold may just come out. If it doesn't after a minute, I'll put you back on track.
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:29.720]  Chris Stern
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:33.720]  You can, since you're going to be recycling soil and organics and you're going to want
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:38.840]  to stay sustainable, you can put it in your soil bins when you're recycling your soil to help break
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:43.240]  down organic matter in there, such as leaves and stalks. Tanner Iskra
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:44.040]  Hold dead roots. Chris Stern
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:48.760]  Root balls, everything. Put it in there, put a top layer, mix it in while you're covering it.
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:49.560]  Tanner Iskra
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:56.920]  The mulch is my next step. And as far as mixing bucotia into your soil, traditionally it's a 2%
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:13:00.360]  by volume. So two gallons for 200 gallons. Chris Stern
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:00.840]  Okay. Tanner Iskra
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:02.120]  Yeah, that goes a long way. Chris Stern
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:07.960]  So yeah, I mean, you're going to have to build a trough or something or buy a res or something
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:11.800]  to mix up your soil in. A tarp on the ground works, but it's low down and it's hard to work with.
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:12.840]  Tanner Iskra
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:13.400]  Kitty pools are good. Chris Stern
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:15.240]  Kitty pools are awesome. There you go. It's a good idea.
[01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:15.320]  Tanner Iskra
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:17.880]  And then buckets and then store it. Chris Stern
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:20.280]  Buckets, yeah. Rubbermaid containers work really well.
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:20.440]  Tanner Iskra
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:21.560]  Big ass trash cans. Chris Stern
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:22.440]  27 gallons. Tanner Iskra
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:25.960]  When you guys see that white stuff growing on your soil, don't freak out. That's good. That's
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:26.840]  what you're aiming for. I've seen people- Chris Stern
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:27.880]  Black's bad, white is good. Tanner Iskra
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:30.280]  ... open it up and see that white growth and throw their shit away.
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:31.080]  Chris Stern Don't do that.
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:31.160]  Tanner Iskra
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:36.040]  So mix your soil, grab some Grokashi, mix it. So if you're going to reamend your soil,
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:39.560]  make sure Grokashi in, put your amendments in there, like you were saying, mix it up in a
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:43.880]  kitty pool or on a tarp, put them up in a Rubbermaid container.
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:44.600]  Chris Stern Don't be afraid to eat the biodiverse.
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:44.680]  Tanner Iskra
[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:51.880]  And then what I would recommend doing is swinging by GA's and picking up either cocoons,
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:57.560]  or if you really want to, it's a lot of fun, but live worms and throw them in there.
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:58.120]  Chris Stern Okay.
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:13:58.360]  Tanner Iskra
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:03.800]  And just let them go to town because either they're going to die or they're going to survive.
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:07.000]  They self-populate, so they'll either get in there, they'll do well.
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:14.200]  If your soil is optimal and is running how it should, your worms will reproduce and you will
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:20.280]  have an active soil food web. And they do help, but I know Sean's had experience with them kind
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:23.080]  of over-ferting the plant with breaking down. Chris Stern
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:27.560]  Yeah, they find hot spots. So if you mix your, so let's say that you mix your soil and you're
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:32.280]  like, dang, I don't know if I did that good enough. Maybe throw some worms in there and
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:37.400]  they tend to find hot spots and they'll work their way through it and they tend to break it
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:43.640]  up. But yeah, actually I was running, I went into one of my rooms and saw some test plants with a
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:48.200]  little bit of nitrogen toxicity. And so the tips of the leaves were kind of pointing at the ground
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:52.760]  and they were a little dark green. I was like, this is weird. I don't feed them anything.
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:15:00.440]  How is this happening? So it was actually alfalfa hay that I mulch or that I used to mulch with,
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:07.240]  but the worms went crazy in it and started just eating the shit out of it. And I guess they
[01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:13.720]  cycled it and it burnt my plant. It didn't burn my plant, but it was taking up a lot of it. Yeah.
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:15.880]  I mean, it was, it was pretty amazing. So it really kind of...
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:17.320]  Mike Santos So you can kind of overdo it with
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:18.120]  organics as well. Chris Stern
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:21.480]  Yeah. I mean, you don't, you really want to be less is more with organics.
[01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:24.040]  Mike Santos You got to know what breaks down
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:29.800]  in what fashion and how long it takes to break down. And, you know, knowing your plant, don't,
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:35.800]  don't run one plant, one cycle in organics and give up because you want to dial that in. And it's,
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:39.240]  it might take one or two runs, but that's the beginning. You know, you got to start growing.
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:40.280]  Chris Stern Yeah. You got to start somewhere.
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:42.600]  Mike Santos And then whatever your best friend told you
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:48.280]  to mix your soil at, do it at half that rate because it's way easier to fix the deficiency
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:52.120]  than it is to flush out some sort of something that you put in there way too high.
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:54.760]  Chris Stern Grow science does not work all the time. So...
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:57.960]  Mike Santos Do you carry any sort of dehydrated coconut water?
[01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:01.160]  Chris Stern Yes. Well, I don't want to say yes. So we've
[01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:08.520]  been working really hard. We kind of revamping inventory we're carrying. Soon we'll be, cover
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:14.440]  crops will be available. All amendments will be available. Yeah. We'll have herbal inoculants. So
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:18.680]  not just, we'll be able to offer things like alfalfa meal, crustacean meal, oyster shell
[01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:24.520]  powder, kelp meal. It's all food grade. It's all organic, but we'll also be carrying aloe vera
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:31.240]  powder, freeze dried coconut powder. This is all organic, cold processed. It's of the highest
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:37.320]  quality. We'll also be starting to carry, I don't know if we can grind herbs. Can we start saying
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:39.960]  that? Can we say that we're going to start powderizing our own herbs?
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:43.720]  Mike Santos Rocky Mountain Worm Company in the next few months is definitely going to be
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:51.880]  changing a face. Nothing is set in stone yet, so I won't say anything definite, but the community is
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:56.520]  definitely going to have a lot more things available to them for their organic needs.
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:59.880]  So just keep an eye out, follow our Instagram, Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:03.720]  How about some sort of like a feed chart or something to go with all the goods you're
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:07.960]  offering? Is that available yet? Not yet. So basically we're trying to
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:14.120]  work out inventory first before we tell you what to use and not have it for you to use.
[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:17.880]  That's a good idea. Thanks. So yeah, we're really working on inventory right now.
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:24.360]  We're, we've worked it out a couple of times. A couple of the products that we were had on our,
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:28.280]  we call it the Rocky Mountain Natural Farming Schedule. A couple of things that we had on there
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:33.240]  initially are a little harder to source and I don't think that we'll be able to keep the regiment
[01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:38.200]  up if people actually pick it on. So we're trying to make sure that if that occasion does happen,
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:43.400]  like I was saying, I mean, I guess we can say he already bought the damn grinder. So we're going
[01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:47.320]  to start powderizing our own herbs, even if we don't start selling them, we'll start be doing,
[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:52.120]  we're going to start doing experiments of powderizing our own yarrow and alfalfa and stuff.
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:58.200]  But we will have, I would say April is going to be, is the big kickoff date.
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:03.400]  We'll be at the Cannabis Cup in some fashion. So you can't miss me with the beard. Come find me.
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:09.000]  It's Colorado, bro. There's a lot of beards now. You can't, trust me, I'll have some type of hat
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.160]  on if I don't have my BMO hat on. And then Rocky Mountain Worm Company will be,
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:19.560]  they'll be getting a booth. So, and then potentially around that time, we'll have some new
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:23.960]  info that they want to release. As far as like I said, us carrying a new product,
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:29.080]  us releasing feeding charts. There's going to be a lot of stuff out. So you can come and catch us
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:33.080]  at the cup. If you- Yeah, come by the Rocky Mountain Worm Company booth guys, because I
[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:37.400]  will be hanging out. We're going to schedule probably a good two hour block each day. The
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:41.640]  cup is three days. I'll probably pick two hours at it. I'll try to do different times or maybe
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:44.360]  the same time. I don't know. I want to be able to meet as many people as I can, but that's a
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:49.160]  landmark for me to go. Yeah, let them know. We'll try to come back on here one more time,
[01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:53.000]  but in the meantime- Oh, we got plenty of time. Oh, definitely. Yeah. Let Jeff know when you want
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:58.520]  them there. Yeah. Tell me. Be like, dude, noon to two or like, well, I got to get into the cup.
[01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:02.040]  You got to stand in line for three hours before we can even get in. So after I get in the cup,
[01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:04.680]  I'll just go to your guys' booth and I'll be there. Yeah, just come find us. Hey, you're going
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:09.160]  to need a place to sit down, dab out. I'll have some water for you. Yeah. Yeah. Dude, I started
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:12.440]  partying in the line last year. It was so much fun. I got out of the dab rig and started dabbing
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:15.800]  people out in line and the cops were standing there just looking at us like, well, okay.
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:20.680]  You just got to celebrate. It's a big thing and it was 420. Yeah, exactly.
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:25.320]  Yeah. The booth will potentially have some really cool stuff. We'll be able to,
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:29.640]  we'll have some example containers of all of our cover crops. We'll have example of all of the
[01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:32.040]  amendments and things out there. I'll have some flowers there, you guys. Yeah,
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:37.320]  we'll definitely have some. And we'll have plenty of flower. Yeah. This has been one of the stoniest
[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:41.720]  episodes we've recorded. There has been a joint burning the entire show. These guys are rolling up
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:46.040]  combs as we speak. We're about to light up another one. This one is the homegrown using the Rocky
[01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:51.880]  Mountain Worm Castings. Nice. Everything you guys showed up with smells and looks and tastes
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:58.600]  delicious. Yeah, we try to keep it connoisseur quality in what you should be smoking. I kind
[01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:02.120]  of cut you off a minute ago. You were about to hype out the Instagram for Rocky Mountain Worm
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:05.480]  Company. Tell us how we can find the Worm Company and stuff. And we'll do that again at the end of
[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:09.000]  the show too. But since you were almost there, I'm going to let you do it. It's Rocky Mountain
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:17.560]  Worm Co. It's Rocky and then MTN Worm CO. Or you can check Sean out on Rocky Mountain Natural
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:23.640]  Farming. I know there's a little, what's that called? Underscore. Yeah. Rocky,
[01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:32.680]  Rocky MTN underscore natural farming or King underscore Cola underscore. We'll work a link
[01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:36.680]  out so you can just find all of us after the show. When I post up a, when this episode goes
[01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:40.760]  out, I'll try to post up all of those in the listing with the show. I post up to Instagram
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:43.960]  and Twitter and all that. So hopefully people will find you and follow you. Yeah. I don't have
[01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:48.360]  any parchment paper, but who wants a little fingerprint dab? Fingerprint dabs. We want to
[01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:52.520]  keep it real organic in here. They'll take a fingerprint dab. Why not? I ain't scared. We're
[01:20:52.520 --> 01:21:02.520]  bros. That stuff smells delicious. Yeah. That smells like some turkeys. Shout out to Jibbs and
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:08.120]  Ken from THE. Yeah. Jibbs is an awesome dude. Yeah. They're out at the, oh yeah. Shout out
[01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:13.640]  that they just won second place at the cup. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, man. And they'll be at the
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:19.320]  Denver cup for sure. I know that there'll be running some more of growing Kush one mile high
[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:25.320]  stuff and he will be stopping by the Worm Company booth also. We'll, we'll come back with that.
[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:29.240]  We're going to schedule hopefully some times for you guys to come by and meet some of your favorite
[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:33.640]  growers and stay in the booth. There's going to be a lot of people in Denver, so it's going to be
[01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:38.200]  a real interesting weekend. Growing Kush one mile high, bro. Get in touch with me. Yeah. We'll have
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:44.520]  to try to talk to Jeff down here one day, man. Yeah. The dirty low. You can meet us in Colorado
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:50.040]  Springs and mob down with us. There we go. I just got a gift for him. Oh, see, that's even more of
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:54.840]  an incentive. Gifts are always worth the drive. Speaking of gifts, I have to reach for a business
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:58.280]  card. Where did I put that business? I'm going to let you do it, bro. These, the kind of guests
[01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:01.720]  on the show, my new friend, I had to write down his name because I totally expected Jay and I
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:06.200]  wanted to call him Jay all day. His name is Nick. You guys, his name is Nick. He brought me a killer.
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:10.360]  Uh, it's a wire wrap. If you're a hippie, if you're a woke dude, this is the most killer wire wrap.
[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:14.920]  It's some, I cannot identify the Jasper. I'm sure it's Jasper. It's a red, yellow Jasper,
[01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:19.320]  Picasso, Jasper. I'll remember that because I'll remember the artist Picasso. It's red, yellow,
[01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:23.960]  and green Jasper wrapped in a really sweet wrap. I've never seen a wrap that style. It is dope.
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:29.320]  It is from clear sky creations. Check them out on Etsy. Uh, can I say the artist's real name?
[01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:33.960]  It's on the card. Oh yeah. Go for it. Uh, is it Elise? Yeah. Okay. Check out this artist,
[01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:38.600]  Elise. Dude, Elise. Thank you. I am wearing this with pride. Yeah. I think everybody in the crew's
[01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:46.920]  got like four. It's a thing now. And I think all of us have links to her on our Instagram. Scroll
[01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:51.560]  through. We've all got shots of pages, you know, check our stuff out. We, we put a lot of posts of
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:55.720]  what we're doing and how we're doing it. You know, we're not hiding anything from anybody.
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:23:01.000]  This isn't, you know, nothing that isn't already available. So why not tell someone how to do it
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:06.040]  as long as they're willing to learn, but, uh, you know, just check our stuff out and, uh,
[01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:11.400]  we're community. It's time for this fingerprint dab. It smells fingerprinting. Um, they get you
[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:16.360]  like 10 times. I have to ask a question now so that somebody will talk while I dab this. Um,
[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:21.000]  I want to know about, I want to start a compost bin and I've got some worm castings now. Uh,
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.120]  and I don't have, obviously I live in, I live in the city. I don't have a lot of space. I
[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:27.560]  wanted to use that little space right over there by the trash can. Maybe. Uh, could,
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:32.360]  could you guys help me start my own little compost bin? Yes. I'll, uh, I'll, we'll get you a bukkake
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:37.720]  as far, I'll tell you what, as far as, uh, our first sponsorship agreement, I'll bring you down
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:43.640]  a bukkake bucket. So we'll start you some anaerobic compost, and then we'll also get you set
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:49.560]  up on a actual compost pile for more of a traditional system. So you can finally start
[01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:55.320]  to recycle all your leftover avocados, your banana peels, eggshells, everything like that.
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:24:00.600]  You're vegan, correct? Not vegan, but vegetarian. Vegetarian. So the worm castings are vegetarians
[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:05.160]  as well. Uh, besides the minerals that they eat. So people that are worried about that,
[01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:09.960]  don't be afraid to put it in your garden. Right on. Yeah, definitely. That's important nowadays.
[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:13.560]  I know. So shout out to all the vegans. Sorry guys, I was off mic for a second,
[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:17.480]  taking one of these delicious dabs. I kind of want to turn the nail up to make it burn better,
[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:22.040]  but I want to turn it down to make it taste better. It's such a toss up. I forgot there's
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:27.080]  a slogan they have for that. You don't waste it to taste it. You gotta waste it. I'm not a dabber.
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:31.800]  I'm a flower guy. So they hate us because they ain't us. Peanut butter and jealous.
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:37.080]  Yeah. Uh, yeah. Shout out to my friend that watched that movie with me twice this week.
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:43.320]  Shout out to the interview. James Franco and Seth Rogan. They killed that movie. You know,
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:46.760]  for the first few minutes I wanted to smack Franco. I was like, oh, he's going to ruin
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:50.600]  this movie. But then like the director must've pulled him aside and been like, tone it down to
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:55.160]  seven. You're on 11. Let's just go to seven. You just, I think now you just going to let that man
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:25:01.000]  do what he, he does. Cause he, if no one's watched freaks and geeks, it's an older show. You know,
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:06.520]  not too old. Cause we're, we're not that old here, but, um, it's a great show. Check that out. It's,
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:11.400]  it's old school Franco. I've never seen an actor spit so much in a scene before. That's weird.
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:17.720]  That was the movie though. You know, just like they perfectly did the Lord of the Rings references
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:23.640]  on key. That was, that was needed in that movie, but that was just a beautiful movie.
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:29.560]  Oh yeah. So I was glad that Netflix put that on there. So, so like a Bokashi bucket. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:34.840]  So we'll get you a Bokashi bucket. We'll start you with an anaerobic compost so we can start
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:42.440]  recycling all of your kitchen scrap. And then as far as your plant waste, the maze,
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:48.200]  different materials like that, we can also show you how to recycle those. Basically what you're
[01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:52.920]  going to want, what I would recommend doing would be, so you want to start a compost bin,
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:59.800]  take a leftover pot from last season, start out with a nice soil base, just dump it in there.
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:05.560]  And then just feel free to start adding stuff, you know, throw stuff in there. I keep a bucket
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:11.160]  in my, like a five gallon bucket in my back door and I'll just throw things into it. And then every
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:16.920]  couple of days I'll walk that out to the actual compost pile in my backyard and then dump that in
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:22.440]  there, throw some worm cast. Typically I do for per like five gallon bucket full, I'll do like a
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:31.160]  handful of worm castings. And then the secret is brewer's yeast. So you throw brewer's yeast onto
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:40.200]  the pile. And then if you really want to Bokashi grain. Yeah. If you look at, what is it? Buena Tea,
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:45.640]  the company, their fungal, their compost accelerator is like a worm castings kelp and
[01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:52.280]  a brewer's yeast. Yeah. You'd be amazed what you can find out. They're like, how do you know all
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:58.200]  this stuff? It's like, well, if you turn the bottle around, read what's going on. Don't be afraid.
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:04.040]  You know? And then if it says it and you're like, wait, kelp, brewer's yeast, alfalfa, all of this
[01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:10.680]  stuff I see at the store, go and buy it. Yeah. Yucca extract, molasses. You can try to source it
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:15.960]  from somewhere that is sourcing it naturally, whether they grow it sustainably or they've been
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:21.640]  growing it for a while. You might not be able to get it to from where you are. But you know,
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:27.000]  someone is making it somewhere and if you want it, it might be, you know, if you can't find it,
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:32.200]  you're not looking hard enough. Yeah, exactly. It's somewhere. Yeah. Craigslist, man. Yeah. Google.
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:38.600]  Yeah. Backwoods. That's those people are your friends now. You know, if you want barley straw,
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:43.400]  you want hay, you want manures, you want compost, you want any of those things.
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:47.800]  Find someone that's feeding there. People look at, go on Craigslist. People want to get rid of it.
[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:50.680]  They'll pay you to come and get it the hell out of there. Yeah. Right. Come clean up my shit.
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:55.880]  That's how I got all of my alfalfa hay. It was, the guy had to scrape his horse pens.
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:59.480]  And I don't know if you're familiar with horses, but they scrape the pens
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:02.760]  and I went and collected that. So I got a lot of the alfalfa hay that I ran
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:08.120]  in my last grow. Nice. So it got repurposed. It didn't get thrown in a landfill.
[01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:13.320]  And it got to grow. It wasn't wasted. Yeah. Last grow. I was, I was really like motivated
[01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:20.200]  to make all of my own nutrients. Um, really motivated. So I learned how to kind of source
[01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:24.360]  it from everywhere for just about free. You've kind of murdered yourself trying to be so motivated.
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:30.680]  That means that basically I, all I had to pay for last grow was power. I didn't have any other
[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:35.320]  money. Nice. You know, so that's helpful. It was, it was, you know, organics keeps your pocket.
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:39.880]  Yeah. The past, I'm not going to lie. The past like half a year has been a little rough and
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:45.640]  I didn't have all the money to really do what we wanted to. So it was, let's buy fruits. Let's take
[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:50.440]  the cores and the skins and the pits and let's ferment and make a plant juice out of it. And
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:55.720]  it's like, Oh, I can grow micro greens and peas and sprouts and I can eat them in my sandwiches,
[01:28:55.720 --> 01:29:01.400]  but I can also ferment and use them as a tea additive or a foliar spray. The same thing with
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:07.400]  my eggs. Like I'm buying eggs from the store. I'm going to save my eggshells because I can use that
[01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:11.960]  with apple cider vinegar, which I'm already buying because I, you know, I drink it for health
[01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:17.800]  reasons. Yeah. So you just mix that. So you Brown eggshell, crush them up, Brown, some eggshells,
[01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:23.320]  mix it with apple cider vinegar, water soluble calcium. So you can make everything in your grow
[01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:29.320]  with nothing. And if you've done it, it's easy to learn where it comes from, what it is,
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:33.240]  where nature would have provided it. Go by the Oriental fish if you're hungry and you need to.
[01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:37.720]  So if you and your plants are hungry in the same, at the same time, what I'd recommend doing is
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:41.560]  cruising on down to your local Asian market and grabbing you some black fish, the darker, the
[01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:48.040]  better. I don't know the exact reason, but I would just go with it. So yeah, you go and get you better.
[01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:52.280]  That's what Dr. Chow said. And so, I mean, you gotta, you just gotta go with, he's a kind of
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:57.880]  the founder of natural farming, but yeah, so you can take some, so yeah, literally go and buy you
[01:29:57.880 --> 01:30:05.880]  some fish, clean it, eat what you want, whatever's left over, blend it, you know, typically with like
[01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:16.200]  a Brown sugar, blend it all up together and then seal it and 30 days strain it, add a IMO, which
[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:22.280]  or a, you can, which is an indigenous microorganisms or EM1 or lactic acid bacteria. Any of those will
[01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:26.920]  really work in that situation. And that's the one thing about organic gardening and sourcing
[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:32.920]  things locally. It's going to help your plant fight off a lot of different diseases, pests that
[01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:38.040]  are found in your region. Especially if you're growing outside, use a lot of different IMOs.
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:43.400]  It's just indigenous microorganisms. Yeah. We will be having a,
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:46.360]  maybe we'll get into that a little more in another episode.
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:51.800]  Chris- We will be having a class or I don't want to say it's a class. We can go ahead and mention
[01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:56.920]  it on here. So we want to start doing classes, but we need to know who wants to come to them.
[01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:57.960]  Tanner Iskra, MPH- Yeah. Let us know.
[01:30:57.960 --> 01:31:02.520]  Chris- So let us know. So we're going to try to schedule a meet and greet before this month is
[01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:09.880]  over. Maybe up in Colorado Springs, where if you listen to us, you follow us on Instagram,
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:15.560]  you've heard about the shop, you want to talk. Yeah. You know, just, we want to meet you. We
[01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:19.560]  want to hear from you. You want to know who you are. You're important to us. So we'll get all of
[01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:24.280]  that stuff situated. Now that we're a sponsor, you'll hear from Jay show or Jeff show when that's
[01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:27.160]  ready. Tanner Iskra, MPH- Yeah. We'll keep you guys posted. I like to announce when that stuff's
[01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:30.920]  coming. We're going to do another night like that at Hygro also in the future, but Jesse's been
[01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:34.840]  booked busy. Chris- Yeah. I've actually talked to Jesse about the potential of us teaming up
[01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:39.160]  and maybe doing some classes together. He's Tanner Iskra, MPH- Get hands on with everybody.
[01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:44.760]  Chris- Jeff is so good at just articulating what needs to be done to like basic, just, I mean,
[01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:47.880]  really anybody. He can tell anybody how to grow. Tanner Iskra, MPH- I was hoping he was going to
[01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:51.240]  be here tonight. Chris- Yeah. But I know they're doing some like really cool classes. I think they
[01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:56.040]  did like cloning last time and some really like awesome introduction classes. So I'm hoping we
[01:31:56.040 --> 01:32:00.600]  can kind of team up and maybe do some more advanced classes for the- Tanner Iskra, MPH- Yeah. Start
[01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:04.600]  off easy and then go into the heavy stuff and then people can leave if they get lost. Chris- Exactly.
[01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:09.720]  Or if they come to our, if you come to us and you feel like maybe you need to, you know what I mean?
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:15.640]  Maybe we're a little over your head, contact Hygro and Jesse and they'll tell you, they'll walk you
[01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:19.480]  through the process. They'll teach you how to clone, they'll teach you how to pH or they'll,
[01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:24.120]  whatever you need, they'll get you going. And then whenever you feel comfortable or you're ready,
[01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:28.280]  come to us, you know? And- Tanner Iskra, MPH- Yeah. I try to keep stuff, if you follow me on
[01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:35.240]  Instagram, the BigToker underscore, kind of try to keep things simple so everybody can kind of
[01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:41.320]  grasp it. And then, you know, from there you can delve into a little bit more because a lot of
[01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:46.360]  growers, when they use bottle nutrients, they go to the Hydro store and they ask,
[01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:54.440]  what do I need to grow? What are you using? And it's like, you got to do some research to be a
[01:32:54.440 --> 01:33:00.120]  grower and your plants will appreciate that and you'll notice it in your results at the end. But
[01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:09.800]  I'll explain things, but I'll let you open your mind to it more. So I'm going to be running a lot
[01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:15.000]  of examples with products that we're going to be carrying and research and development. So
[01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:21.000]  that's with Sean's page too, and the Rocky Mountain Natural Farming. So just keep an eye out and just
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:25.560]  be part of the community. Especially when you're in Colorado, if you want to link up and talk
[01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:32.440]  organics, we're always around. When is the shop open? The shop is open during the day. Get there
[01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:40.600]  before like two. It's a little earlier in the day. It's like a 10 to four, I think. Jay is usually
[01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:44.920]  there. So flexible. The phone number's on the door. He's there basically every day of the week
[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:51.960]  from about 10 to four. And then outside of that, just email or call or message him through Instagram
[01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:59.880]  and he'll meet you 24 seven or yeah, contact Nick. But if you want it, we got you. Yeah,
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:02.840]  we can get you what you need. And that's not just me, you guys, that's the customers. That's
[01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:05.960]  the people. Yeah, exactly. That's the people, the growers, the patients. I didn't mean to call you
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:11.800]  customers, but the shoppers. Yeah. No, yeah. We want them to know that the product's out there,
[01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:14.920]  but the help's out there at the same time. Don't feel like you're doing this alone.
[01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:19.160]  These guys have put me on the track to organics. Like without a couple of conversations between
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:25.240]  Spence and Sean, I'd still be using the bottles. It's not worth it. And Nestor. Yeah, shout out.
[01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:28.440]  Spence. I don't know if you guys are familiar with Nestor, but Nestor up in Denver, he's won a few
[01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:33.240]  cups. I forget the shop he used to grow for, but that dude gave a talk one night about soil
[01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:37.800]  recycling and reconditioning. Oh yeah. There's a lot that sparked my brain. Yeah. So hopefully,
[01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:41.640]  you know, we can definitely get on here again and have some more conversations and get into
[01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:46.280]  things a little bit more in depth. This is my one argument with organics, all right, with your
[01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:54.680]  plants. If, okay, when you go to put it in your plant, I want you to freaking drink it before you
[01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:59.480]  put it in your plant. And if you don't feel comfortable doing that, then don't use it on
[01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:06.040]  your plant. I will eat anything in my garden right now. Just throw that out there. Even the worm poop?
[01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:12.440]  Even the worm castings? You will not have to pay me to ingest something in the garden that we have.
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:19.480]  Everything is how it should be. As a patient, you medicate in many different ways. And one of those
[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:26.040]  ways is ingesting raw cannabis as a plant. Juicing the leaves, the nugs. There's a lot of
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:34.920]  beneficials for that with pain fibromyalgia, just with antibiotics in the cannabis. So
[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:39.080]  releasing a lot of more of those cannabinoids that aren't available, what you can smoke or
[01:35:39.080 --> 01:35:43.400]  ingest through edibles. And some people can't take edibles or ingest and that's not what they're
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:51.480]  looking for. So, having a plant that you can actually chew, it's what should be like any
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:53.160]  vegetable or flower. You should be able to eat it. It's indigestible.
[01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:57.800]  Chris Steininger If it's for medicine, I believe it should be food grade. That's kind of how I
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:02.760]  look at it. If you're going to be treating it as medicine, then it should be food grade. Recreational
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:08.840]  purposes, it is what it is. But if you're going to be, for example, a medical dispensary, I'm
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:12.520]  calling you out. Quit using the shit. If you want to know how to grow proper
[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:14.360]  cannabis for your dispensaries, get out of it.
[01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:15.240]  Chris Steininger Sick people don't need
[01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:19.560]  phosphates. I mean, they really don't. And there's even other companies.
[01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:23.720]  Michael Kemp EGLE 20. Oh, I had a conversation about that earlier. Take that off your shelf.
[01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:26.280]  Chris Steininger People need to educate themselves.
[01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:27.400]  Michael Kemp Take everything off your shelf and get some worm castings.
[01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:30.520]  Chris Steininger I wouldn't even say that. Just people need to educate themselves.
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:36.360]  Don't go jump into organics. Don't go and read every organic book and buy everything in there
[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:41.560]  because that's just as bad. I mean, there's reasons that you, I mean, I would almost say
[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:47.560]  use synthetics instead of bone meal or blood meal because those care, those are more harmful than
[01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:53.080]  they are good. Same thing with glacial rock dust, soft rock phosphates, different things like that,
[01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:58.200]  azomites, they carry heavy metals and used in large quantities like a lot of these super soils
[01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:02.600]  call for. You're putting more, the same, if not more heavy metals into your plant.
[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:04.040]  Michael Kemp You're using chelated nutrients.
[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:06.840]  Chris Steininger Exactly. So you really want to
[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:12.120]  educate yourself and that's key. I really want to emphasize that if it's for medical purposes
[01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:17.320]  and you won't ingest the, if it's not food grade, it's not medical grade.
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:19.800]  Michael Kemp Exactly. So I can eat worm castings.
[01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:21.400]  Chris Steininger You can totally eat worm castings.
[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:25.800]  Michael Kemp I wouldn't recommend it, but the, the, the basis is, is you're not going to get sick.
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:29.880]  It's not going to hurt you. You're not going to, you know, I'm just, that's kind of where I'm
[01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:34.680]  coming from is that, you know, if, if it says keep out of reach of children and it has a warning
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:40.040]  label of like what to do when you get it in your eyes, that's, that's not cool. I mean, if it's like,
[01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:44.760]  if I can't touch it, if it can't touch my skin, why can't it touch my plant? And that's really
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:51.320]  where I'm coming from. I, I feel like people are just not aware. Like I said, just educate
[01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:54.440]  yourselves. Not every organic option is the best or, you know, or what is said organic.
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:55.800]  Chris Steininger Right. Yeah. You said the, yeah, the
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:59.720]  one meal and bone meal, that's a slaughterhouse product. That's their cow left over.
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:00.760]  Michael Kemp No way you source it from.
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:02.040]  Chris Steininger Exactly. And it's, yeah, especially
[01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:07.080]  depending on where you source it from. A feather meal, the, that's just as, that's even worse.
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:07.320]  Michael Kemp Yeah.
[01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:07.960]  Chris Steininger Feather meal is-
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:08.920]  Michael Kemp The McDonald's chicken farm.
[01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:09.080]  Chris Steininger Yeah.
[01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:12.360]  Michael Kemp Cover crops, you know, barley and stuff like that, like that you're going to use
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:16.600]  as a mulch, you know, watch out where you get that from. You don't want any dyes or any pesticides
[01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:17.320]  used with that.
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:20.200]  Chris Steininger That's like 99% of corn is all GMO.
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:20.520]  Michael Kemp Yeah.
[01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:22.520]  Chris Steininger So for your seed sprouted teas.
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:24.360]  Michael Kemp Whoa, that was a weird noise.
[01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:24.840]  Chris Steininger Hold it guys.
[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:27.400]  Michael Kemp Oh, wow. Okay. That's what happens when that cord touches there. That was pretty
[01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:32.600]  neat. That's what happens when the email cord touches the microphone or the headphone jack.
[01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:33.400]  You guys, that was neat.
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:35.320]  Chris Steininger Just dab my eardrums.
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:37.320]  Michael Kemp It's all like a weird heartbeat in my head.
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:39.960]  I'm taking a dab. Somebody say something intelligent.
[01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:42.120]  Chris Steininger I don't know right now. I'm saying,
[01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:46.040]  I forgot what we're talking about real quick. Cause that's sometimes how it goes. You're just
[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:47.400]  sitting around the table taking dabs.
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:47.800]  Michael Kemp Yeah.
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:50.120]  Chris Steininger I don't know what we're taking a dab of right now, but-
[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:53.080]  Michael Kemp I just, basically if you're really-
[01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:54.440]  Chris Steininger Yeah, you, we're using our-
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:56.280]  Michael Kemp We're still on, we're still on starting,
[01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:57.640]  you know, running organics.
[01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:00.680]  Chris Steininger There's so many avenues to go and, you know,
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:02.680]  it's just-
[01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:05.720]  Michael Kemp My head is still making that noise from the headphone jack after that dab.
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:07.480]  Wow, that was good.
[01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:11.000]  Chris Steininger Start off, start off slow and, you know,
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:18.520]  don't read too many books. Go, like I said, source things that were written a little while ago.
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:21.320]  There's a really good website called The Unconventional Farmer.
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:22.040]  Michael Kemp Yeah.
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:22.920]  Chris Steininger Yeah.
[01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:24.280]  Michael Kemp Shout out Gil Cardigan.
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:26.600]  Chris Steininger Yeah, he's, they are really cool dudes.
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:31.080]  They keep it real simple and fun. It's very hands-on and-
[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:32.520]  Michael Kemp Squiggles WordPress.
[01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:33.080]  Chris Steininger Yeah.
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:34.680]  Michael Kemp I don't know if you guys are familiar with them.
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:37.160]  Cchar.org.
[01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:38.840]  Chris Steininger Yeah, there's a lot.
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:40.040]  Michael Kemp Not microbes.
[01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:43.800]  Chris Steininger Don't go to dot coms. Go to dot orgs or edus.
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:47.080]  But even then, you know, check where it was sourced from.
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:50.200]  But just explore. Don't be afraid to go to the library.
[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:52.680]  Michael Kemp Yeah, don't just stick to weed forums and stuff.
[01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:57.080]  We're not growing just cannabis. You're growing a plant.
[01:39:57.080 --> 01:39:59.000]  And this benefits you.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:39:59.560]  Charles We're switching to farming now.
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:01.320]  Michael Kemp Yeah, this benefits you in every way.
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:02.360]  Chris Steininger On the subject, let's just,
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:03.960]  you want to touch on some books real quick?
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:04.440]  Michael Kemp Let's do it.
[01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:05.240]  Chris Steininger Since we're right here.
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:05.480]  Michael Kemp Yeah, okay.
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:06.920]  Charles This is Sean's department for sure.
[01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:07.640]  Michael Kemp Touch my books.
[01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:10.440]  Chris Steininger Okay. TLO, True Living Organics.
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:10.760]  Michael Kemp Yeah.
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:11.400]  Chris Steininger Read it.
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:11.720]  Michael Kemp Yes.
[01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:12.120]  Michael Kemp Yeah.
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:13.080]  Very good beginner book.
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:15.000]  Chris Steininger Don't follow it word for word.
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:20.200]  But it is an, I mean, it's one of the best books I've ever read.
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:21.880]  It teaches you what you can and can't use.
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:25.560]  Michael Kemp It was detrimental in creating who I am today.
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:30.040]  For the simple fact of that, it taught me what things were, where they were from.
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:34.280]  It really opened my eyes to how you can create your own nutrients and all that.
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:35.640]  You shouldn't just take everything at face value.
[01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:37.080]  Charles The first time I mixed up my own tea,
[01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:38.920]  that's the book I grabbed for instructions.
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:40.680]  Michael Kemp That was my first jump into organics.
[01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:42.280]  Chris Steininger And that goes right back though to,
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:49.160]  you know, depending on how you personally want to garden and what level of organics you want to be on,
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:51.000]  that's where you want to take things with the grain of salt.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.280]  So you might not want to use all of the phosphate products,
[01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:56.600]  or you might not want to use all of the animal-based products.
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:59.320]  Michael Kemp It's definitely a good guideline.
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:40:59.880]  Chris Steininger Yeah, exactly.
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:01.640]  Michael Kemp And that's the thing with growing cannabis,
[01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:02.520]  you're doing it your way.
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:03.240]  It's like music.
[01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:08.920]  John Bonham might've played it, and you could play it and give it your own flavor, you know,
[01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:11.560]  put open hi-hats somewhere and do your thing with it.
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:14.120]  Because your plants are in a different room.
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:18.120]  You could, we can mix up the same exact nudes and feed all of our plants that,
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:19.720]  and some of our plants are going to be pissed off.
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:20.680]  Chris Steininger Completely different.
[01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:22.760]  Michael Kemp Yeah, so you gotta perfect it.
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:24.520]  It's like having girlfriends, man.
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:26.520]  One of them is not going to like the same thing as the other one.
[01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:27.560]  John Bonham It's not even getting to that.
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:30.760]  Chris Steininger You're probably smart.
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:32.680]  Michael Kemp I try sometimes.
[01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:36.440]  Michael Kemp Well, you know, yes, I'd say that we were,
[01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:38.920]  you know, the TLO is a good place to start.
[01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:39.320]  John Bonham Okay.
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:42.200]  Michael Kemp And then you, while you're reading through
[01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:45.880]  that or before you read through that, I would recommend everybody should just,
[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:48.200]  it sounds stupid, but just make yourself read it.
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:52.120]  Everybody should read some sort of Jorge Cervante or Ed Rosenthal.
[01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:53.000]  Everybody should read it.
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.080]  If you haven't, read Ed Rosenthal.
[01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:57.080]  John Bonham The Oaksterdam Course Guide.
[01:41:57.080 --> 01:41:58.120]  Michael Kemp Marijuana Horticulture.
[01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:00.360]  Yeah, that's the one, the Oaksterdam Course Guide.
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:01.800]  It's marijuana horticulture.
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:04.520]  I highly recommend reading that one.
[01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:04.680]  John Bonham Set your room up right.
[01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:06.600]  Don't cut corners in your room.
[01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:09.960]  Sometimes you might have to in the beginning, but as you go,
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:12.120]  something to do is definitely upgrade your room.
[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:12.440]  Michael Kemp Yeah.
[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:14.280]  John Bonham Dial it in, have an environment.
[01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:21.320]  With the organics, the one thing that you're trying to do is mimic nature to your fullest.
[01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:27.800]  And when growing in a pot and using a chelated nutrient in a bottle,
[01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:30.440]  there's nothing living going on.
[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:31.720]  There's no nature.
[01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:37.960]  So by bringing that, those microbes into your pot, you're doing so much to your plant.
[01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:42.200]  It's actually going back to what it should.
[01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:43.240]  And it might take it a little bit.
[01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:46.520]  Some strains might freak out depending on where you get it from.
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:51.960]  But if you're going to do organics and you like to start from seed, definitely start from seed.
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:53.480]  Michael Kemp Start from seed.
[01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:54.040]  John Bonham Yeah.
[01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:55.800]  Get some good quality genetics.
[01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:57.240]  Don't skimp on that.
[01:42:57.240 --> 01:43:01.560]  Cuts are good, but definitely a good way to grow is start some seeds.
[01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:03.000]  Jump in.
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000]  And even if it's bag seed, it's-
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:05.640]  Michael Kemp Yeah.
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:07.160]  I don't oppose growing a bag seed.
[01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:08.040]  John Bonham No, it's not bad.
[01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:09.000]  Michael Kemp My dog was a bag seed.
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:09.400]  John Bonham Yeah.
[01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:13.960]  If you got a bag seed and it turns out to be a reg seed,
[01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:18.840]  pollen happens and it might be beneficial for you to let it happen the first time.
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:19.640]  Who knows?
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:21.160]  But that's a whole other subject as well.
[01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:22.600]  Michael Kemp As long as they're not all female.
[01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:23.720]  All right, more books, more books.
[01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:24.760]  What you got on track?
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:25.320]  Ed Rosenthal Yeah.
[01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:29.240]  I'd read TLO would be one of the first ones.
[01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:31.080]  Marijuana Horticulture, Ed Rosenthal.
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:33.160]  Some sort of basic book.
[01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:37.000]  His books are amazing just because they touch on so many different bases.
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.200]  It's a great gateway.
[01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:44.520]  And when you read books like that, if you're not familiar with academia and going to school
[01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:49.320]  and things like that, it really helps recharge you and teach you how to research and teach
[01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:50.040]  how to learn.
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.240]  And that's where I really recommend reading books.
[01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:56.760]  John Bonham And that's where The Rev, I think,
[01:43:56.760 --> 01:44:02.680]  pinpoints his book as getting hands-on to people that aren't necessarily, like Sean said, book
[01:44:02.680 --> 01:44:04.680]  smart or can sit in a classroom and learn something.
[01:44:04.680 --> 01:44:06.680]  Ed Rosenthal The Rev will tell a joke in the middle of a paragraph.
[01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:06.840]  John Bonham Yeah.
[01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:09.400]  He'll do it totally off key.
[01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:12.440]  Ed Rosenthal So if you think like, oh man, I hate reading,
[01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:14.280]  or if you're not like that type of guy, just try it.
[01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:17.160]  And I promise, and it's different when you want to learn something.
[01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:19.720]  But yeah, so I would go with those books.
[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:20.840]  Those are great bases.
[01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:26.280]  And then when you want to start getting a little bit more advanced, obviously, most
[01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:29.160]  people are familiar, have heard of Teeming with Microbes.
[01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:32.200]  So that one, it's a little complex.
[01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:36.680]  That one I read over and over and over again.
[01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:39.080]  It's a quick reference book.
[01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:41.800]  So you'll use The Rev's book a lot.
[01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:45.080]  And you'll see when you're a beginner and you're mixing soils and you're making teas,
[01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:45.720]  you're going to have that.
[01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:49.000]  It's going to, you're going to end up buying six copies of it because you're going to have
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.640]  it next to your brewer and you're going to leave it on the page.
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:54.200]  Ed Rosenthal If you don't know how to do something, he
[01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:56.760]  starts you off and he lets you know that you might mess up.
[01:44:56.760 --> 01:44:59.720]  But like you said, smell your teas, you're going to smell bad.
[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:04.760]  But yeah, the Teeming with Microbes book will eventually become like that for you once you
[01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:07.640]  kind of, you know, once you get to the next level, you're going to start.
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:07.800]  Yeah.
[01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:11.480]  Once you get in there, but once you've covered your, your basis and you're a little bit more
[01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:17.480]  familiar with the soil food web and how things work as far as nutrient cycling and you get
[01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:21.640]  a little bit more familiar with compost tea inputs, why you're using them and you really
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:22.520]  like, oh, you know what?
[01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:23.880]  This is, this is cool.
[01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:28.760]  I'm using my, even if you're using your bottled organic nutrient, you got your earthworm castings
[01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:32.680]  and your mix, you're doing your weekly teas and you're rolling and you're like, man, this
[01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:33.080]  is cool.
[01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:34.520]  I want to take it to the next level.
[01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:35.800]  I've already read these books.
[01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:40.600]  Especially if you live in a state to where you don't really, you know, not everybody's
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:41.640]  open about growing.
[01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:42.280]  Yeah.
[01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:43.640]  Don't be afraid to grow.
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:48.440]  Where I would go is then where I would turn is like where we were kind of talking about
[01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:54.680]  earlier, you know, there's a lot of PDF files about Korean natural farming, different things
[01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:56.360]  like that, natural farming inputs.
[01:45:57.320 --> 01:46:01.400]  That's where I would recommend going once you kind of get comfortable with your basis
[01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:05.400]  and that'll tell you how you can actually make your own inoculants, how you can make
[01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:06.520]  your own fertilizers.
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:06.920]  Nice.
[01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:09.640]  And that's where, save all your money.
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:09.960]  Yeah.
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:13.960]  The unconventional farmer shows that, but the Rev, getting back to this, since this is like
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:19.720]  a beginning into organics, he shows you different ways to do it that might suit your grow style.
[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:24.040]  If you don't want to necessarily do teas, but just want to use water as he talks about,
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:27.800]  nutrient spikes that you can put in your soil that are beneficial.
[01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:29.640]  And that's how I first got into organics.
[01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:35.000]  I just, I couldn't have some plants inside, so I needed to put them outdoors and not have
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:36.040]  to check on them that much.
[01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:37.400]  So I said, why not try it?
[01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:39.320]  And it worked out pretty, pretty well.
[01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:40.760]  Don't, don't overdo it.
[01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:41.560]  That's for sure.
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:41.960]  Okay.
[01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:43.480]  Cause you can really mess things up.
[01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:47.400]  I think I actually said on like what may be the first show about how I actually ran a
[01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:48.360]  lot of the Rev stuff.
[01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:48.680]  Yeah.
[01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:49.160]  Yeah.
[01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:49.480]  Yeah.
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:50.680]  Fucked my world up.
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:51.240]  Yeah.
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:52.760]  But you know, you gotta learn some more.
[01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:55.800]  Animal proteins and you could really overdo a lot.
[01:46:55.800 --> 01:46:57.000]  You can really burn your plants.
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:58.280]  They get super hot.
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:47:00.680]  They need to decompose over time.
[01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:03.320]  You need to give them their, their moment to shine in your soil.
[01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:06.120]  So you don't, the Revs, I wouldn't try the Revs mix.
[01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:06.840]  Yeah.
[01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:12.520]  What I would do is if you really want to start mixing your own soil and like you really,
[01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:16.840]  you're just fucking just determined on it and you go into the Hydro store and you're
[01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:18.280]  going to pick up some amendments.
[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:23.320]  Basically, if you're going to go with the back soil, it doesn't matter.
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:26.680]  You can go Sunshine 4, you can go Pro-Mix, you can go Happy Frog.
[01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:28.200]  It doesn't matter.
[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:30.040]  Just pick what you want.
[01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:34.040]  I personally would recommend you go on with the sterile medium, something with not no
[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:35.240]  real nutrient pack to it.
[01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:35.640]  Yeah.
[01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:37.240]  Start from a laboratory standpoint.
[01:47:37.240 --> 01:47:42.680]  I would recommend like a Pro-Mix or a base Sunshine mix, or even a Sunshine Advanced.
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:46.040]  Think those options are really great.
[01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:50.840]  If you don't even want to buy your own back soil, then just go and pick up a brick of
[01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:57.000]  peat moss from Lowe's, go and get you a bag of perlite from, you know, the Hydro store.
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:57.240]  Yeah.
[01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:58.040]  Or the farming store.
[01:47:58.040 --> 01:47:58.680]  Or the farming store.
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:47:59.560]  Garden supply store.
[01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:03.240]  Just watch out because, you know, sometimes when you source that stuff, things can come
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:03.560]  in it.
[01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:08.840]  So you might want to treat it naturally before you start using it or, you know, keep an eye
[01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:11.560]  on it because pests are everywhere.
[01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:13.720]  Little bugs, microbes are everywhere.
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:16.120]  Fungus in, you know, you don't want to bring in...
[01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:19.720]  How much are my worm castings going to help me keep away those pests?
[01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:24.280]  That's going to build up just everything in the soil around your rhizosphere that the
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:25.240]  plant needs.
[01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:29.880]  You know, it's going to start fighting the fight before your plant's even growing.
[01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:33.160]  You know, so it's like, I don't know, like an antibiotic.
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:37.000]  I mean, it's going to help build your plant's immune system.
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.560]  Like you said, it'll start fighting it from the inside out.
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:41.000]  That kind of goes back down into...
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:42.040]  Building a shield.
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:47.720]  ...eating bacteria and how that's cycled through the plant, which I'd love to come to...
[01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:48.600]  We're going to get some...
[01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:52.840]  Tell Jeff you want classes because I really want to get to talking about like the different
[01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:56.520]  what is in our castings and why they work.
[01:48:56.520 --> 01:48:59.000]  Yeah, we'll do more episodes for sure.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.960]  I'll have you guys back soon because I want to do an episode about like...
[01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:04.360]  We can't have everybody...
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:06.520]  Guys, we're not telling you to throw away the bottled nutrients today.
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:07.560]  That's not what anyone's saying.
[01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:07.800]  Don't go just...
[01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:09.560]  We're going to find a balance for you.
[01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:14.200]  So that'll be one of our next topic is the find the balance between the bottles and the organics.
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:14.600]  Yeah.
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:16.200]  In the meantime, yeah, just don't...
[01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:18.120]  Yeah, don't toss your bottled nutrients.
[01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:21.000]  Don't throw anything away.
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.240]  Slowly get some worm castings.
[01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:23.640]  Yeah.
[01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:27.080]  Start making teas and then slowly start working things out.
[01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:28.200]  It's not like a...
[01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:31.480]  You're not just going to magically become an organic gardener.
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:31.720]  Right.
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:33.080]  Dip your foot in the water.
[01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:33.400]  Yeah.
[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:35.960]  This could be the way to way improve your growing though.
[01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:37.960]  This could make your buds taste better.
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:39.000]  It'll make them grow bigger.
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.040]  The taste of your...
[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:41.480]  Yeah, you can smell it in this room.
[01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:42.280]  It's just sweeter.
[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:43.000]  And who knows?
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:47.640]  There's a lot of growers who will actually go to make the transition and they'll find their nice
[01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:50.600]  little happy spot in the middle and nothing's wrong with that.
[01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:50.840]  Yeah.
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:55.080]  You know, if that's what you want as a grower, I know a lot of people who are really happy and
[01:49:55.640 --> 01:49:58.840]  just kill it growing synthetics and organics together.
[01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:03.240]  So yeah, like you said, it can really improve your growing style and whether you want to
[01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:07.480]  commit to going fully organic or you want to run synthetics, I think that everybody could benefit.
[01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:08.280]  Yeah.
[01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:09.320]  Just a little bit of worm casting.
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:14.120]  Some of the flower that we're actually smoking tonight was grown by a friend that works at the
[01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:18.600]  grow warehouse in Colorado Springs who uses Rocky Mountain worm castings, but he
[01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:22.920]  integrates it with nectar of the gods, but he uses nectar of the gods in a very low
[01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:26.520]  dosage with teas and he uses cover crops and things like that.
[01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:34.520]  So he does practice an organic style of growing, but it's not full organic permaculture.
[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:36.040]  It's got that bottle kick.
[01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:36.280]  Yeah.
[01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:38.280]  It's got that little boost that it needs.
[01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:38.600]  Okay.
[01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:39.640]  The training wheels.
[01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:43.880]  Yeah, the training wheels, but he is actually an arborist.
[01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:45.080]  I've been looking into that.
[01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:50.920]  So one of the things that we want to try to be able to present through Jay is if it holds any
[01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:54.920]  merit to anybody out there, we're going to call it Rocky Mountain Natural Farming Certified.
[01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:59.960]  So what we'll do is we're going to try to start looking into some of these products for you.
[01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:00.520]  Yeah.
[01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:02.360]  And we will R&D everything.
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:07.000]  We'll give it our stamp of approval and there is no OMRI listing for us, man.
[01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:12.200]  There is no, there's, I mean, there is an OMRI listing on certain,
[01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:15.640]  you know, bottled nutrients and stuff, but we have nothing to really go off of.
[01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:19.880]  We need to create some sort of system and that's what we're really hoping to do.
[01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:21.000]  Know where you source from.
[01:51:21.240 --> 01:51:25.800]  Take the time for you to look into where your products come from, how they're made,
[01:51:25.800 --> 01:51:27.320]  how they affect the final product.
[01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:30.680]  So that if I'm in your store, I can buy that and know that I didn't just buy.
[01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:33.560]  I'll tell you who planted it, where it came from, you know,
[01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:36.680]  I'll tell you how it was harvested and when it was harvested.
[01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:38.760]  And that's very important.
[01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:40.280]  You guys are going to have to hire more people,
[01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:44.280]  open your doors more after a couple of episodes, you're going to get people knocking on your door.
[01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:45.000]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:50.120]  And in the meantime, as we get things working, like I said, you know, please contact us.
[01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:56.200]  You know, we're working really hard to make orders and keep everybody happy.
[01:51:56.200 --> 01:51:57.320]  Do you guys ship?
[01:51:57.320 --> 01:51:58.200]  We do ship.
[01:51:58.200 --> 01:51:58.920]  Nationwide.
[01:51:58.920 --> 01:51:59.560]  Nationwide.
[01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:00.440]  They're all like, oh yeah.
[01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:03.880]  We have homies all over the place that use Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:05.400]  What's the website?
[01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:07.880]  Rockymountainwormcompany.com
[01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:09.880]  Or you can get in touch with any one of us
[01:52:10.920 --> 01:52:15.000]  through Instagram or our emails that we will leave with Jeff.
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:19.480]  I would highly recommend if you want something out of the state of Colorado,
[01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:22.920]  I would recommend going online and then just sourcing it straight through
[01:52:22.920 --> 01:52:24.440]  rockymountainwormcompany.com
[01:52:25.640 --> 01:52:29.160]  As far as local growers, I cannot stress this enough.
[01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:31.320]  We want to know who you are.
[01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:35.320]  If you're in Colorado, stop by the store, let us know.
[01:52:35.320 --> 01:52:38.600]  Tell us, I talked to Jay a little earlier, we're trying to work something out,
[01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:41.080]  but tell us that you listened to the show and that you heard about it
[01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:43.880]  and we'll give you a quarter pound of cover crop for free.
[01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:45.720]  Just for mentioning that, you know.
[01:52:45.720 --> 01:52:46.600]  We'll figure something out.
[01:52:46.600 --> 01:52:47.320]  We're nifty.
[01:52:47.320 --> 01:52:48.680]  So you never know.
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.960]  Just to repeat what he said, I want to, because the listeners were high.
[01:52:51.960 --> 01:52:55.560]  If you mentioned, if you shop at the worm store and you say that you listen to the podcast,
[01:52:55.560 --> 01:52:58.920]  they'll give you a quarter pound of cover crop to start off your organics.
[01:52:58.920 --> 01:53:00.120]  So I said, help out your organics.
[01:53:00.120 --> 01:53:00.760]  It'll go on top.
[01:53:00.760 --> 01:53:02.680]  It'll keep everything moist so that your worms don't,
[01:53:02.680 --> 01:53:04.360]  or your worm castings don't dry out.
[01:53:04.360 --> 01:53:05.960]  So that your mycofungi go in.
[01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:08.680]  It does not die on you while it's growing and then when things dry out.
[01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:10.840]  Because I think I let mine get a little too dry lately.
[01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:11.160]  Yeah.
[01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:14.680]  You want to use the natural enzymes of plants that are around you.
[01:53:14.680 --> 01:53:18.520]  And that's one big thing with organics is with sourcing things locally.
[01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:20.280]  We're gonna have to do like six episodes with you guys.
[01:53:22.680 --> 01:53:23.640]  Another thing is.
[01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:24.680]  What do you want to hear guys?
[01:53:24.680 --> 01:53:25.320]  What do you tell us?
[01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:30.360]  For the month of March, like I said, we're hoping to have some big things planned for April.
[01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:32.920]  So we're hoping to have, we want to have a meet and greet this month.
[01:53:32.920 --> 01:53:34.920]  We want to know who everybody's out there.
[01:53:34.920 --> 01:53:39.880]  Planning to have one or two classes in March all leading up to the cup with our business stuff.
[01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:45.800]  But for the month of March, we're going to try to offer what I would call free consultation.
[01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:50.600]  Basically, we want to help you replace your nutrients.
[01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:56.200]  So if you want to direct message me, Nick, Alan, Jay, email us.
[01:53:57.880 --> 01:53:59.400]  Or Jeff and get in touch with them.
[01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:01.880]  And what we want to do is we want to know what you're using.
[01:54:01.880 --> 01:54:02.200]  Yeah.
[01:54:02.200 --> 01:54:02.520]  Okay.
[01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:04.680]  And we're going to, we want to help you out with that.
[01:54:04.680 --> 01:54:07.000]  You'll say, but for this bottle, you could try this.
[01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:07.320]  Exactly.
[01:54:07.320 --> 01:54:08.040]  Throw away this bottle.
[01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:09.800]  You know, and then if, for example,
[01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:14.520]  if you're in Nebraska or you're in Canada or you're in England.
[01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:19.640]  If you're growing in a computer or a basement, we can direct you in the right direction.
[01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:24.040]  Or, yeah, what I was going to say, or even we can, we can give you your product.
[01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:27.800]  And then if we can't, if it doesn't seem logical, it's just been no good.
[01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:30.680]  You know, it's, it's that jet life.
[01:54:30.680 --> 01:54:31.960]  Alan's the joint monitor.
[01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:33.960]  I come from the East coast.
[01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:36.440]  I'm saying I usually smoke blunts.
[01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:42.120]  I was respectful in this situation because I didn't know if you smoke the blunts, but I am a
[01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:43.400]  blunt master.
[01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:45.960]  Sean, I know is as well from the East coast with me.
[01:54:45.960 --> 01:54:50.840]  So he's not afraid of the blunts as well as Spencer probably smoked way more blunts than you
[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:52.200]  would think.
[01:54:52.200 --> 01:54:55.960]  So, uh, you know, I brought the Dutchies, but I showed up with the Dutchie.
[01:54:55.960 --> 01:54:56.120]  Yeah.
[01:54:56.120 --> 01:54:57.000]  I brought the Dutchies.
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:58.600]  So I just didn't, uh, roll on.
[01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:00.440]  So maybe we have to roll on for a farewell.
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:02.520]  Some of us hate our lungs.
[01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:02.840]  Yeah.
[01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:03.480]  Yeah.
[01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:07.480]  I love quality cannabis, but I love Dutch masters.
[01:55:07.480 --> 01:55:10.440]  I'll take one or two off it just to be, uh, just to celebrate with you.
[01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:10.680]  Yeah.
[01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:11.320]  You know?
[01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:11.800]  Yeah.
[01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:14.040]  We can, we can just not in every day.
[01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:16.120]  So I get, I get so lit off the tobacco.
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:17.320]  It just makes my head weird.
[01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:18.760]  It's just a, it's a tradition.
[01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:23.080]  And you know, I came out here and everybody smokes joints, but when I came out here, I
[01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:28.280]  couldn't find the Dutchies until one day I went to a little convenience store that had the Dutchies.
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:30.680]  So shout out to that little convenience store in Colorado Springs.
[01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:31.640]  He did a back flip.
[01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:31.960]  Yeah.
[01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:33.400]  I was all these Dutchies.
[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:34.680]  A homie told me about it.
[01:55:34.680 --> 01:55:35.800]  He came into a session.
[01:55:35.800 --> 01:55:38.920]  I was like, man, you just made my heart melt.
[01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:40.520]  Cause like that is beautiful.
[01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:43.400]  And they were fresh and it was a great night that night.
[01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:46.120]  So shout out to them for always keeping the fresh Dutchies.
[01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:46.600]  There you go.
[01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:48.120]  All right.
[01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:50.200]  So meet and greets coming up in March.
[01:55:50.200 --> 01:55:50.360]  Yeah.
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:51.480]  I was just going to say that too.
[01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:53.480]  Sorry to interrupt you, but do it, do it.
[01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:54.360]  I'm here all the time.
[01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:54.600]  Yeah.
[01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:56.040]  So we're up in the Springs.
[01:55:56.040 --> 01:56:00.760]  Uh, Nick and I just kinda, we did a little side, uh, side meeting real quick.
[01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:03.560]  And, uh, we might be having maybe like a barbecue.
[01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:08.520]  So maybe we can do some organic, um, you know, demonstrations there and get some little meet

[01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:14.840]  know the community.

[01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:19.800]  Like I said, we'll, uh, we'll keep in touch with you.
[01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:20.440]  We'll let you know.
[01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:23.720]  We're going to try to set a date for a nice little formal meet and greet.
[01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:29.080]  If you want to drop by and say, Hey, Friday night, we'll record you saying that.
[01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:32.520]  I mean, there, there are phones we can text and things like that too.
[01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:34.600]  I just need to carry your pigeon.
[01:56:34.600 --> 01:56:36.200]  I'll put your text on the show.
[01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:37.240]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:41.880]  But yeah, if you just, we'll get it to you to get out there and, uh, yeah, we'll just
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:44.200]  put a date out, but we're going to have a meet and greet this month.
[01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:48.840]  Uh, next month we plan to have one or two classes leading up to the cup and then we're
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:52.200]  going to try to help everybody out as much as we can.
[01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:59.000]  And like I was saying before, if you want to change the way you grow, email us, email
[01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:02.920]  Jeff, email Nick, email Alan, email Jay.
[01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:05.480]  We'll, you know, tell us what you're using.
[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:10.040]  Tell us, you know, if you've ever done organics, give us a little bit of background about yourself.
[01:57:10.040 --> 01:57:11.240]  How do you do things?
[01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:15.800]  You know, are you familiar with organics and let us help you, let us help change the way
[01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:18.280]  you grow or at least change the way you source things.
[01:57:18.280 --> 01:57:21.960]  We like to really want to shine some light on what you're using.
[01:57:21.960 --> 01:57:27.480]  We want you to understand that's like, you know, okay, this is, you know, this is a better
[01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:27.960]  option.
[01:57:27.960 --> 01:57:28.280]  Yeah.
[01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:30.200]  Not everything that's in a bottle is bad.
[01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:34.360]  Some companies do care what their patients are putting into their plants and into their
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:34.840]  medicine.
[01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:37.000]  So there are some good companies.
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.320]  So like I said, you're buying a lot of water.
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:40.120]  Yeah.
[01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:41.800]  There's a lot when you, yeah.
[01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:48.040]  When you go to the hydro store and you're asking somebody a question, go to the bottle
[01:57:48.040 --> 01:57:48.920]  and read things.
[01:57:48.920 --> 01:57:53.560]  A lot of companies put a face on their brand and that's marketing and that's not what organics
[01:57:53.560 --> 01:57:54.040]  is.
[01:57:54.040 --> 01:57:57.240]  Organics is actually like having the product and it does what it does.
[01:57:57.240 --> 01:58:02.280]  A lot of bottles put things on their labels to make you go towards the bottle that exactly
[01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:05.160]  the same thing as another nutrient line that might be a little cheaper.
[01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:07.000]  And it's just, you know, it's the same value.
[01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:10.440]  That's why some companies change their label every three months.
[01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:11.800]  Big inside secret.
[01:58:11.800 --> 01:58:18.040]  You know what that 98% inert ingredient is, you know, water, water, and you got to pay
[01:58:18.040 --> 01:58:19.480]  for that to be shipped.
[01:58:19.480 --> 01:58:21.000]  Water is expensive, man.
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:21.800]  Oh yeah, it is.
[01:58:21.800 --> 01:58:25.160]  You got to drive it across the country, put it in a plastic bottle and throw the bottle
[01:58:25.160 --> 01:58:25.240]  away.
[01:58:25.240 --> 01:58:26.280]  Truckers don't like doing that.
[01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:27.960]  Kids in Africa need it.
[01:58:27.960 --> 01:58:28.760]  Yeah.
[01:58:28.760 --> 01:58:30.520]  A lot of people can use that water.
[01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:31.720]  So, you know, get some dry amendments.
[01:58:31.720 --> 01:58:32.600]  Grow organic.
[01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:35.080]  Kids in Africa need the water from your nutrient bottle.
[01:58:35.080 --> 01:58:36.600]  There's water coming out of your faucet.
[01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:39.320]  So just make your own nutrients with the water coming out of your faucet.
[01:58:39.320 --> 01:58:39.720]  There you go.
[01:58:39.720 --> 01:58:39.880]  All right.
[01:58:39.880 --> 01:58:41.160]  We've been going for a little bit over an hour.
[01:58:41.160 --> 01:58:44.200]  We should start wrapping it up because the listeners get high as like we do and they
[01:58:44.200 --> 01:58:45.480]  start getting ADD.
[01:58:45.480 --> 01:58:48.440]  Does anybody have anything they want to plug or anything that they really need to get off
[01:58:48.440 --> 01:58:50.280]  their chest here at the last couple minutes of the show?
[01:58:50.280 --> 01:58:51.400]  I'll let you go around the circle.

[01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:06.120]  I'll put it in the show notes and I'll tweet that out.
[01:59:06.120 --> 01:59:07.240]  We'll get it out there.
[01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:07.560]  Sweet.
[01:59:08.280 --> 01:59:08.440]  Yeah.

[01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:16.520]  So this this was definitely a nice little intro to it.
[01:59:16.520 --> 01:59:17.880]  This is number one of this.
[01:59:17.880 --> 01:59:19.320]  There'll be six or seven of these episodes.
[01:59:19.320 --> 01:59:19.480]  Yeah.

[01:59:35.720 --> 01:59:36.840]  and just getting it done.
[01:59:36.840 --> 01:59:39.880]  You can really save some money and have a beautiful quality product.
[01:59:39.880 --> 01:59:41.400]  So why wouldn't you want to?
[01:59:41.400 --> 01:59:42.520]  Why wouldn't you want to do that?

[01:59:52.040 --> 01:59:54.600]  And, you know, thank you for having us, Jeff.
[01:59:54.600 --> 01:59:55.080]  Oh, for sure, man.
[01:59:55.080 --> 01:59:55.560]  Thanks for coming.
[01:59:55.560 --> 01:59:55.960]  Time.
[01:59:55.960 --> 01:59:57.400]  What's your Instagram?
[01:59:57.400 --> 01:59:59.160]  The big toker underscore.
[01:59:59.160 --> 01:59:59.720]  All right.
[01:59:59.720 --> 02:00:00.040]  Follow him.
[02:00:00.040 --> 02:00:00.920]  He's got some good pictures.
[02:00:00.920 --> 02:00:03.240]  Yeah, I try to keep it real for you guys.
[02:00:03.240 --> 02:00:05.080]  And it's my it's lifestyle.
[02:00:05.080 --> 02:00:08.120]  He's the one that reached out to me and got him on the show and got this group on the show.
[02:00:08.120 --> 02:00:09.640]  Well, Sean's been here, but Jay was supposed to come.
[02:00:09.640 --> 02:00:10.040]  What's up, Jay?
[02:00:10.040 --> 02:00:10.680]  Where are you, bro?
[02:00:10.680 --> 02:00:11.880]  Yeah, we're going to get Jay on.
[02:00:11.880 --> 02:00:13.400]  You hear how much fun this is, right, dude?
[02:00:13.400 --> 02:00:14.600]  It's don't be scared.
[02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:15.160]  Don't be nervous.
[02:00:15.160 --> 02:00:16.040]  Don't be worried.
[02:00:16.040 --> 02:00:17.000]  Don't buy another car.
[02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:17.960]  Don't do inventory.
[02:00:18.040 --> 02:00:18.840]  Come hang out with us.
[02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:20.360]  Do you want to smoke a dab?
[02:00:20.360 --> 02:00:20.920]  Chill out.
[02:00:20.920 --> 02:00:21.160]  Yeah.
[02:00:21.160 --> 02:00:23.480]  Jay does not medicate like that.
[02:00:23.480 --> 02:00:28.520]  So he will probably be floating on the ceiling just from the the aroma around us.
[02:00:28.520 --> 02:00:29.400]  The second hand.
[02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:30.680]  Yeah, we have to use the couch.
[02:00:30.680 --> 02:00:32.760]  Yeah, we might have to put him in another room or something.
[02:00:32.760 --> 02:00:34.920]  One time I gave Jesse a dab dab.
[02:00:34.920 --> 02:00:35.800]  I said a dab.
[02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:39.320]  I gave Jesse a dab and he ended up on that couch for about two hours.
[02:00:39.320 --> 02:00:40.440]  I can totally believe it.
[02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:41.000]  That's good.
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.480]  I've had some of those any shout outs or plugs or anything over there, bro?
[02:00:44.600 --> 02:00:45.640]  Clear sky creation.
[02:00:45.640 --> 02:00:47.240]  Yeah, I create creation.
[02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:50.280]  Make sure to say the name of the wonderful artist that made this beautiful wrap.
[02:00:50.280 --> 02:00:50.840]  His wife.
[02:00:50.840 --> 02:00:52.040]  That's my wife, Elise.
[02:00:52.040 --> 02:00:52.600]  Nice.
[02:00:52.600 --> 02:00:53.480]  Thank you, Elise.
[02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:53.960]  It's awesome.
[02:00:53.960 --> 02:00:54.520]  I dig it.
[02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:55.320]  I'll wear it all the time.
[02:00:55.320 --> 02:01:01.080]  I'm going to put it on a shorter chain so that it doesn't cover up my Irie logo and end up in all my food because if the length it is, it'll end up in my food, bro.
[02:01:01.080 --> 02:01:02.600]  And we figure you're a big guy.
[02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:03.720]  It's all over the place.
[02:01:03.720 --> 02:01:04.280]  I love it.
[02:01:04.280 --> 02:01:04.600]  I love it.
[02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:05.480]  I'm just going to shorten it up.
[02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:06.440]  I'll use the same necklace.
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:07.800]  I'm just going to make it a little shorter.
[02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:09.000]  I'll rock it every day.
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:09.720]  Every other day.
[02:01:09.720 --> 02:01:11.000]  Probably trade.
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:12.120]  I think mine's shorter.
[02:01:12.120 --> 02:01:13.400]  Yeah, dude, I'm down if you are.
[02:01:13.400 --> 02:01:14.600]  That looks just about the right length.
[02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:16.840]  Yeah, out of the like my food bowl goes right there.
[02:01:16.840 --> 02:01:17.160]  For sure.
[02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:18.280]  She makes them all the time.
[02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:18.760]  So nice.
[02:01:18.760 --> 02:01:19.880]  Thanks, man.
[02:01:19.880 --> 02:01:21.640]  I'll just go have her shorten that one for me.
[02:01:21.640 --> 02:01:22.360]  There you go.
[02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:23.160]  Final word.
[02:01:23.160 --> 02:01:24.360]  Go buy some worms.
[02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:25.080]  Use your worms.
[02:01:25.080 --> 02:01:26.360]  Yeah, do worm son.
[02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:27.400]  Worm castings.
[02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:30.760]  If you're going to get worms from us, use the tag.
[02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:32.280]  What are you worming with?
[02:01:33.240 --> 02:01:35.720]  I just I'm going to coin that right now.
[02:01:35.720 --> 02:01:37.800]  So hashtag what are you worming with?
[02:01:37.800 --> 02:01:41.960]  And don't be afraid to let us use your like you said, we're a community.
[02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:44.360]  So let's let's come together.
[02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:45.880]  So one random question to you guys.
[02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:48.280]  I'm adding OGT into my mix with my worm castings.
[02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:49.320]  I'm just wasting money now.
[02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:50.120]  How do I use it?
[02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:50.840]  Yeah, don't.
[02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:58.440]  OGT is a sulfuric phosphate trichoderma hyzarum, which has actually been taken out of like
[02:01:58.440 --> 02:02:00.040]  great white a couple of their products.
[02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:01.720]  They cycle nutrients too quickly.
[02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:05.800]  I don't know if you're familiar with OG Bioar, but it's the same reason they recommend not
[02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:08.920]  using the new pack with a hydroponic system.
[02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:10.920]  It'll actually cycle nutrients out of the plant.
[02:02:10.920 --> 02:02:11.480]  Okay.
[02:02:11.480 --> 02:02:12.200]  Yeah. Be careful.
[02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:13.800]  I just, worm castings, man.
[02:02:15.160 --> 02:02:16.280]  You don't even need the molasses every time.
[02:02:16.280 --> 02:02:17.320]  You just answered a question I had.
[02:02:17.320 --> 02:02:21.640]  I have a few plants that are showing some deficiencies and they're fed and it's because
[02:02:21.640 --> 02:02:24.040]  I put so much OGT in there.
[02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:25.240]  So just take that out.
[02:02:25.240 --> 02:02:28.680]  Yeah, when you feed too much of a certain things, it can lock out other things.
[02:02:28.680 --> 02:02:29.080]  Yeah.
[02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:31.640]  But you never would think that OGT would cause you a problem.
[02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:31.800]  No.
[02:02:31.800 --> 02:02:32.760]  I wouldn't assume so.
[02:02:32.760 --> 02:02:37.640]  You know, that's one of the good, I guess that's one of the good things about OGT is
[02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:38.840]  a little bit goes a long way.
[02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:42.360]  They use a very aggressive form of...
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.560]  It's like a third of a cup to 25 gallons of water.
[02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:50.440]  They try to give you a plant that boosts, you know, that you don't get with the organic
[02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:53.400]  sometimes because the plants, you know, still becoming itself.
[02:02:53.400 --> 02:03:00.120]  But yes, bottom line with using Rocky Mount worm castings, no, you don't need to use OGT.
[02:03:00.120 --> 02:03:00.360]  All right.
[02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:00.840]  Definitely not.
[02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:01.800]  You hear that guys?
[02:03:01.800 --> 02:03:05.240]  And I'm not a hater of OGT, but these worm castings are ridiculously cheap.
[02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:07.560]  They are the retarded cheaps.
[02:03:07.640 --> 02:03:11.160]  And then if you want to put soft rock phosphate or anything like that in there, we also sell
[02:03:11.160 --> 02:03:11.720]  that at the shop.
[02:03:11.720 --> 02:03:11.960]  Yeah.
[02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:13.160]  And you can make your own instead of buying.
[02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:16.600]  We'll give you a little, you know, a bump in the right direction.
[02:03:16.600 --> 02:03:17.000]  There we go.
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:18.680]  These guys have already given me 20 new ideas.
[02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:21.960]  I've got like seven products written down that I need to go pick up.
[02:03:21.960 --> 02:03:23.400]  A couple new tricks I want to try.
[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:23.960]  No.
[02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:24.360]  All right.
[02:03:25.160 --> 02:03:25.960]  Did you get your shout outs?
[02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:26.120]  Yeah.
[02:03:26.120 --> 02:03:27.320]  We said thanks to your wife.
[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:27.720]  Oh yeah.
[02:03:27.720 --> 02:03:28.120]  All right.
[02:03:28.120 --> 02:03:28.600]  Yeah, I'm high.
[02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:29.480]  Everyone's high at this table.
[02:03:29.480 --> 02:03:29.720]  I'm feeling nice.
[02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:30.680]  We just want to talk all day.
[02:03:30.680 --> 02:03:32.280]  It's going to be a long episode.
[02:03:32.280 --> 02:03:33.800]  So I'm going to read the part that I read at the end.
[02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:35.240]  It says, thanks for listening to another episode.
[02:03:35.240 --> 02:03:39.000]  You guys don't forget to check out our sponsors, nature's green remedies.com and hygro indoor
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:39.960]  growing supplies.
[02:03:39.960 --> 02:03:43.160]  And of course we hyped him up a little bit on the show, the Rocky mountain worm company.
[02:03:43.160 --> 02:03:45.240]  Check out all my friends that came and joined us today.
[02:03:45.240 --> 02:03:46.040]  Came and joined us.
[02:03:46.040 --> 02:03:47.000]  Yeah, that's a proper sentence.
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:47.240]  Yeah.
[02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:48.760]  Make sure you follow them all on Instagram.
[02:03:49.800 --> 02:03:50.680]  And now the show's over.
[02:03:50.680 --> 02:03:51.800]  Please go to iTunes or Stitcher.
[02:03:51.800 --> 02:03:53.960]  Go to the iTunes store or the Stitcher main page.
[02:03:53.960 --> 02:03:56.440]  Search for agriculture or no search for grow from your heart.
[02:03:56.440 --> 02:03:58.120]  Man, I printed the wrong paper again.
[02:03:58.120 --> 02:03:58.920]  While I said that.
[02:03:58.920 --> 02:04:00.520]  Can I just say like that?
[02:04:00.520 --> 02:04:02.840]  I was so upset about that.
[02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:07.480]  And that is just something that they should, you know, I don't know whatever Apple had
[02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:09.640]  to say, but Hey, you should get in touch with us.
[02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:13.880]  Cause you know, this is something that you should have on your, uh, your station.
[02:04:13.880 --> 02:04:19.880]  So there's actually some, uh, it's an, an educational agricultural entity that does
[02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:24.200]  courses and shit and they didn't want cannabis associated with their school stuff.
[02:04:24.200 --> 02:04:26.840]  So they're like, well, you gotta change that.
[02:04:26.840 --> 02:04:29.240]  If you, if you don't want to use cannabis, we can go with hemp.
[02:04:29.240 --> 02:04:30.360]  So hit us up and let us know.
[02:04:30.360 --> 02:04:31.080]  We'll totally get on.
[02:04:31.080 --> 02:04:32.600]  I think grow from your heart fits perfectly.
[02:04:32.920 --> 02:04:33.480]  I do like it.
[02:04:33.480 --> 02:04:33.800]  Rings.
[02:04:33.800 --> 02:04:34.840]  We're about to grow from our heart.
[02:04:34.840 --> 02:04:35.400]  And that's true.
[02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:35.800]  You know what I mean?
[02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:36.840]  We're not growing from our wallets.
[02:04:36.840 --> 02:04:37.800]  I do love cannabis.
[02:04:37.800 --> 02:04:37.960]  Yeah.
[02:04:37.960 --> 02:04:39.000]  We're growing from our heart.
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:40.120]  So I'll correct myself.
[02:04:40.120 --> 02:04:41.240]  I'll never say I grow culture again.
[02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:42.280]  It's growing from your heart.
[02:04:42.280 --> 02:04:44.360]  Find that review section in there and iTunes and Stitcher.
[02:04:44.360 --> 02:04:46.120]  Give me a five-star rating, please.
[02:04:46.120 --> 02:04:47.640]  You can give me as many as you want.
[02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:51.640]  But what happens is the more ratings I get, uh, the more they move me up, the more I'm
[02:04:51.640 --> 02:04:55.000]  advertised in the show, the more people see us, the more people get to grow better cannabis.
[02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:58.760]  The more people quit using map and DAP, the more people use worm castings, the more people
[02:04:58.760 --> 02:05:00.680]  have better weed and the more patients feel better.
[02:05:00.680 --> 02:05:02.440]  And then your eyes are redder and things are better.
[02:05:02.440 --> 02:05:02.760]  Yes.
[02:05:02.760 --> 02:05:04.360]  And it goes in circles like that.
[02:05:04.360 --> 02:05:05.320]  So type in a comment.
[02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:06.040]  Let me see what you think.
[02:05:06.040 --> 02:05:07.160]  Let me know what you think of the show.
[02:05:07.160 --> 02:05:08.200]  If you think the show is awesome.
[02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:09.720]  Tell me if you think the show sucks.
[02:05:09.720 --> 02:05:12.920]  Tell me, I'll try to improve what you say, but I'll probably just ignore you and keep
[02:05:12.920 --> 02:05:14.120]  doing what I'm doing because I like it.
[02:05:14.680 --> 02:05:16.680]  Stitcher keeps changing the way the comments are handled.
[02:05:16.680 --> 02:05:19.000]  So leave a comment wherever you can find the spot to do it.
[02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:20.600]  And I'll read your comment on the show.
[02:05:20.600 --> 02:05:23.720]  Don't forget that the show is available on iTunes, Stitcher, and every single episode
[02:05:23.720 --> 02:05:26.760]  is archived on iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[02:05:26.760 --> 02:05:29.880]  We recently added a donation button to the podcast page on the website.

[02:05:42.920 --> 02:05:43.800]  I promise you that.

[02:05:51.080 --> 02:05:52.200]  I'll buy new microphones.
[02:05:52.200 --> 02:05:53.720]  I'll buy these new little covers for the mics.
[02:05:53.720 --> 02:05:54.600]  Water bottles.
[02:05:54.600 --> 02:05:55.240]  Water bottles.
[02:05:55.240 --> 02:05:55.560]  Yeah.
[02:05:55.560 --> 02:05:56.200]  Essentials.
[02:05:56.200 --> 02:05:56.440]  Yeah.
[02:05:56.440 --> 02:05:57.320]  You know, just like that.
[02:05:57.320 --> 02:05:58.520]  Every little bit counts.
[02:05:58.520 --> 02:06:01.000]  Somebody told me that I should have the button and they would contribute.
[02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:02.360]  So I put it up there, dude.
[02:06:02.360 --> 02:06:06.440]  So they have not done so yet.
[02:06:06.440 --> 02:06:07.720]  It's only been there for a couple of weeks.
[02:06:07.720 --> 02:06:08.680]  I'm not begging you guys.
[02:06:08.680 --> 02:06:09.480]  If you want to do it, do it.
[02:06:09.480 --> 02:06:10.680]  If not, then it doesn't happen.
[02:06:11.560 --> 02:06:13.560]  Make sure you follow the podcast on Twitter.
[02:06:13.560 --> 02:06:15.480]  There's a new Twitter handle I've been advertising.

[02:06:17.800 --> 02:06:18.520]  The old one.
[02:06:18.520 --> 02:06:22.200]  I'm not going to use it anymore because it's the old word that we're not going to say.
[02:06:22.200 --> 02:06:23.240]  Find me on Facebook.
[02:06:23.240 --> 02:06:24.520]  Search for Grow From Your Heart.

[02:06:31.640 --> 02:06:33.640]  Some contest stuff goes up there.

[02:06:50.520 --> 02:06:51.160]  Don't worry.
[02:06:51.160 --> 02:06:52.920]  Super huge shout out to my ninja spits.
[02:06:52.920 --> 02:06:53.960]  Thanks again for listening, you guys.
[02:06:53.960 --> 02:06:57.160]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[02:06:57.720 --> 02:06:58.200]  Thanks, man.
[02:07:15.400 --> 02:07:17.000]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:21.560]  It's time for episode number 53, 54 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:07:21.560 --> 02:07:24.920]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[02:07:24.920 --> 02:07:28.920]  If you're a new grower, a professional grower, if you're a new smoker, if you're a veteran dabber,
[02:07:28.920 --> 02:07:32.680]  if you're a cannabis activist, or even if you're just someone who's curious about the current state
[02:07:32.680 --> 02:07:35.080]  of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:35.800]  Welcome.
[02:07:35.800 --> 02:07:37.400]  Roll up a fat joint, grab a dabber.
[02:07:37.400 --> 02:07:38.360]  I'm your host, Ross DeGeff.
[02:07:38.360 --> 02:07:40.600]  We are joined today by King Kola once again.
[02:07:40.600 --> 02:07:41.480]  Welcome back, bro.
[02:07:41.480 --> 02:07:42.360]  Thanks for having me, man.
[02:07:42.360 --> 02:07:43.080]  His real name is Sean.
[02:07:43.080 --> 02:07:43.880]  We'll call him King Kola.
[02:07:43.880 --> 02:07:44.520]  We'll call him Sean.
[02:07:44.520 --> 02:07:45.640]  We'll alternate between the two.
[02:07:45.640 --> 02:07:46.520]  He's got an alter ego.
[02:07:46.520 --> 02:07:48.120]  He's like a superhero and shit over here.
[02:07:48.120 --> 02:07:48.760]  It works for me.
[02:07:48.760 --> 02:07:50.440]  He's the organic as fuck superhero.
[02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:51.640]  Ras Kola.
[02:07:52.200 --> 02:07:54.200]  Sitting across the table from me is our good buddy, Jesse.
[02:07:54.200 --> 02:07:55.080]  Welcome back, bro.
[02:07:55.080 --> 02:07:56.120]  Hey, thank you.
[02:07:56.120 --> 02:07:57.160]  Man, dude, thanks for coming.
[02:07:57.160 --> 02:07:59.320]  We're going to let Jesse talk a lot on this episode.
[02:07:59.320 --> 02:08:00.200]  Ah, shit.
[02:08:00.200 --> 02:08:02.120]  Well, yeah, you have a lot of good shit to say.
[02:08:02.680 --> 02:08:04.360]  Yeah, you showed up with the sheets, man.
[02:08:04.360 --> 02:08:05.800]  Yeah, Jesse brought notes and shit.
[02:08:05.800 --> 02:08:06.760]  This is going to be good.
[02:08:06.760 --> 02:08:08.520]  So thanks for coming, guys, on time and everything.
[02:08:08.520 --> 02:08:09.640]  I appreciate it.
[02:08:09.640 --> 02:08:12.680]  As always, I need to give a big shout out to the Mystic Roots man for letting me play
[02:08:12.680 --> 02:08:13.960]  their music on the show.
[02:08:13.960 --> 02:08:16.840]  Big, huge thanks to Kat and Coot and the Mystic Roots crew.
[02:08:17.720 --> 02:08:20.920]  I usually do an ad, but Sean just said something that really got my attention here.
[02:08:21.640 --> 02:08:25.240]  He said that NPK value no longer matters to him.
[02:08:25.240 --> 02:08:28.200]  Would you like to elaborate that now that I've got some microphones turned on?
[02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:35.720]  Yeah, so I think NPK with organic, true organic gardening isn't a necessity.
[02:08:35.720 --> 02:08:39.640]  That's something that is NPK value is all synthetic.
[02:08:39.640 --> 02:08:42.600]  It was invented for synthetic fertilizers.
[02:08:42.600 --> 02:08:43.160]  Okay.
[02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:44.600]  As a way to sell them.
[02:08:44.600 --> 02:08:45.240]  Exactly.
[02:08:45.800 --> 02:08:49.400]  You know, you're just giving the plant what they need when they need it.
[02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:54.520]  And the reason I brought this up to you is I actually saw a post earlier today,
[02:08:54.520 --> 02:08:56.920]  and it was out of a publication.
[02:08:56.920 --> 02:08:58.280]  I'll just read it for you real quick.
[02:08:58.920 --> 02:09:00.120]  Give credit to who it is.
[02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:03.240]  Okay, so this is Plant and Prosper.
[02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:05.880]  He's a really cool guy.
[02:09:05.880 --> 02:09:09.800]  If you don't follow him on Instagram, it's plant underscore in underscore prosper.
[02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:10.520]  Sweet.
[02:09:10.520 --> 02:09:12.360]  Saw him throw this up earlier.
[02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:15.080]  It's Justin Von Liebig.
[02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:21.160]  He's actually credited with creating synthetic fertilizers.
[02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:25.160]  So here's a little excerpt that Plant Prosper posted from a book that he was reading.
[02:09:25.880 --> 02:09:29.800]  NPK gardeners owe their practices to the great scientist, Justin Von Liebig,
[02:09:29.800 --> 02:09:32.840]  the father of artificial fertilizers.
[02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:34.760]  What most don't know is that later in life,
[02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:39.400]  Von Liebig acknowledged a grave mistake in relying only on chemistry.
[02:09:39.400 --> 02:09:43.640]  In fact, he saw negative impacts of artificial fertilizers on life in the soil
[02:09:43.640 --> 02:09:46.760]  and his own vegetable garden and thereafter preferred organic matter
[02:09:46.760 --> 02:09:49.560]  to inorganic chemical fertilizer he invented.
[02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:51.240]  To quote Von Liebig,
[02:09:51.240 --> 02:09:55.000]  after I learned the reason why my fertilizers weren't effective in the proper way,
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.320]  I was like a person that received a new life.
[02:09:57.320 --> 02:09:59.320]  Understanding how nutrients will make us work,
[02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:01.560]  will make us all see the light.
[02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:06.440]  And then ultimately make us better gardeners with more sustainable gardens.
[02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:08.040]  Sorry, kind of butchered that at the end.
[02:10:08.040 --> 02:10:12.040]  Oh no, that's pretty much been your message the whole time anyway.
[02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:16.760]  Is it the synthetics are disrupting the eco life, the organic life and the plants,
[02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:18.440]  and that we need to get away from that.
[02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:21.560]  And have I said on the show that you brought me a Bokashi bucket?
[02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:22.840]  Have I said that yet?
[02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:25.320]  No, last show I mentioned I was going to bring it to you.
[02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:27.160]  Okay, well, I got to give you a big thanks for that one.
[02:10:27.160 --> 02:10:29.400]  Big thanks and shout out to the Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:31.080]  Sean brought me a Bokashi bucket.
[02:10:31.160 --> 02:10:34.040]  I'm one step closer to becoming organic as fuck.
[02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:36.360]  Hell yeah, I ordered one last week too.
[02:10:36.360 --> 02:10:37.880]  Sweet, let me know how it goes.
[02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:39.080]  Yeah, we'll Bokashi together.
[02:10:39.080 --> 02:10:40.520]  Yeah, we'll be Bokashi buddies.
[02:10:41.080 --> 02:10:42.040]  Bokashi bros.
[02:10:42.040 --> 02:10:44.440]  And don't say that out loud, it's not a little weird.
[02:10:46.360 --> 02:10:47.880]  All the growers are like, sounds fun.
[02:10:47.880 --> 02:10:49.960]  Everybody else is like, what the hell are those guys doing?
[02:10:49.960 --> 02:10:51.640]  I'm going to Bokashi with Jeff.
[02:10:51.640 --> 02:10:53.080]  We got to go to a Bokashi class.
[02:10:54.840 --> 02:10:56.840]  It's like the Purple Kalonji.
[02:10:56.840 --> 02:10:58.120]  Purple Kalonji Club.
[02:10:58.120 --> 02:11:00.040]  Mine's turning purple too, I took a lot of pictures today.
[02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:02.600]  Shout out to the Kalonji Kush, that's a sweet strain.
[02:11:02.600 --> 02:11:04.440]  So what were you saying about the NPK?
[02:11:04.440 --> 02:11:09.960]  So yeah, basically NPK was created with synthetic fertilizers as kind of, you know,
[02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:12.280]  the basis behind it.
[02:11:13.160 --> 02:11:17.160]  You give plant nitrogen when it needs it, you give the plant phosphorus and potassium when they need
[02:11:17.160 --> 02:11:22.040]  it or when you think they need it and you bypass this natural process.
[02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:28.760]  And by doing that, when you bypass this process, basically you're just leaving the salts,
[02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:33.080]  the mineral salts and everything that's left over from the fertilizer that's not immediately
[02:11:33.080 --> 02:11:34.360]  taken up by the plant's roots.
[02:11:34.360 --> 02:11:38.360]  You're leaving that in the dirt because you've bypassed all natural chemistry.
[02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:39.640]  It's not being digested.
[02:11:39.640 --> 02:11:40.840]  It's not being broken down.
[02:11:40.840 --> 02:11:41.720]  It stays there.
[02:11:42.280 --> 02:11:47.800]  It's like what you were saying about CO2 and synthetic rooms in the last episode.
[02:11:47.800 --> 02:11:48.200]  Exactly.
[02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:51.640]  There's nothing that, you know, I'm going to have some numbers on that.
[02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:57.480]  So that's basically if I just drank Gatorade all day or something salty all day, I can't
[02:11:57.560 --> 02:11:59.240]  say Gatorade because they'll sue the shit out of me.
[02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:03.080]  But if I drank some, if I just put salt water all day, that's essentially what we're feeding
[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:04.920]  the plants by feeding them synthetic nutrients.
[02:12:04.920 --> 02:12:05.240]  Exactly.
[02:12:05.240 --> 02:12:08.280]  Like you'll pee out the water, but the salts stay in there.
[02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:10.520]  You know, I mean, it's not good for you.
[02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:11.640]  It's not good for the plant.
[02:12:11.640 --> 02:12:15.240]  And someone's going to say, but I flush heavily, but you don't flush often enough.
[02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:19.000]  I don't think even if you get run off, that salt is still binding to you because your
[02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:20.200]  plant has to metabolize it.
[02:12:20.200 --> 02:12:23.480]  And what it does metabolize is still coming out of the roots as well.
[02:12:24.360 --> 02:12:26.440]  So you've got the extra buildup you put in there.
[02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:28.040]  You got the part that was never used.
[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:29.640]  And then you got the part that was metabolized.
[02:12:29.640 --> 02:12:31.800]  You got a lot of salt stuck in there using the synthetics.
[02:12:31.800 --> 02:12:33.640]  Well, then it also forms the plant too.
[02:12:33.640 --> 02:12:35.640]  So it's in the plant materials as well.
[02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:37.000]  Yeah.
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:38.200]  You got to smoke those salts, right?
[02:12:38.200 --> 02:12:38.700]  Yeah.
[02:12:39.560 --> 02:12:40.120]  Salts.
[02:12:40.120 --> 02:12:41.000]  What are you rolling up, dude?
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:42.280]  Because you're a couple of feet away from me.
[02:12:42.280 --> 02:12:44.040]  I mentioned it smells delicious over here.
[02:12:44.040 --> 02:12:45.160]  I swear it's getting stronger.
[02:12:45.720 --> 02:12:48.520]  I think that I brought the Wi-Fi Tahoe.
[02:12:48.520 --> 02:12:50.200]  The Wi-Fi Tahoe smells delicious.
[02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:50.920]  Did you grow that?
[02:12:50.920 --> 02:12:51.560]  I know.
[02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:54.280]  No, I picked it up from a local shop up in the Springs.
[02:12:54.280 --> 02:12:54.760]  Nice.
[02:12:54.760 --> 02:12:56.200]  Shout out to that local shop in the Springs.
[02:12:56.200 --> 02:12:56.700]  Good work.
[02:12:57.320 --> 02:13:02.920]  But yeah, so with the MPK, we don't rely on the numbers.
[02:13:02.920 --> 02:13:07.160]  We rely on more of what is called the nutritive cycle theory.
[02:13:07.160 --> 02:13:13.560]  So it's, you know, the plant, it's kind of like a person, you know, the plant's a baby.
[02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:14.680]  It's growing.
[02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:19.480]  It needs things to aid in, you know, its vegetative growth.
[02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:21.480]  So that's where your nitrogen comes in.
[02:13:21.480 --> 02:13:28.360]  That's where your potassium comes in to help strengthen those cell walls as your plants
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:31.000]  get bigger to make sure, you know, that everything's going properly.
[02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:36.440]  Instead of giving the plant directly what it needs, what we'll do is we'll let the plant
[02:13:36.440 --> 02:13:37.640]  decide for itself.
[02:13:37.640 --> 02:13:41.000]  All of those things will be available in the soil and not in the sense that we're going
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:46.120]  to load it down with alfalfa meal or bone meal or blood meal, but the soil will have
[02:13:46.120 --> 02:13:47.320]  an MPK value.
[02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:53.720]  Usually, you know, I calculated last time and just with the real basic mix of like neem
[02:13:53.720 --> 02:13:59.240]  and Karaja and kelp meal and things like that, I think we were running around like a three
[02:13:59.240 --> 02:14:02.840]  to four is kind of what the fertilizer quote unquote was coming out at.
[02:14:02.840 --> 02:14:03.800]  That's fairly low.
[02:14:03.800 --> 02:14:04.300]  Exactly.
[02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:06.520]  I'm sure that plant got everything it needed.
[02:14:06.520 --> 02:14:07.020]  Yeah.
[02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:10.920]  And that's where we come from is, you know, that's the reason that when you go to the
[02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:18.280]  growth store, you'll see that organic fertilizers are like zero or 1.23 or these extremely low
[02:14:18.280 --> 02:14:23.720]  numbers and people see that and they're like, oh, that's the other one says 0.060.
[02:14:23.720 --> 02:14:25.480]  Like that's going to yield me way more.
[02:14:25.480 --> 02:14:25.980]  Right.
[02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:29.720]  And that's a common misconception.
[02:14:32.040 --> 02:14:34.360]  I mean, you will get bigger buds using that.
[02:14:34.360 --> 02:14:34.680]  Right.
[02:14:34.680 --> 02:14:36.520]  They're not going to be the tastiest or the cleanest.
[02:14:36.520 --> 02:14:40.120]  If I ate a bunch of pennies, I would feel full, but I just shoot out a bunch of pennies.
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:40.600]  Exactly.
[02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:41.080]  Yeah.
[02:14:41.080 --> 02:14:42.600]  I wouldn't get anything from it.
[02:14:42.600 --> 02:14:45.800]  And I'll argue that you're not necessarily going to get bigger buds from it.
[02:14:46.520 --> 02:14:47.160]  Right.
[02:14:47.160 --> 02:14:52.920]  A lot of the, like the, you know, 0.060, that sounds like a powdered bloom booster.
[02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:57.400]  And those things can really fuck your plan up in a hurry.
[02:14:57.400 --> 02:15:00.600]  If you try to go too crazy with them, they're yeah.
[02:15:02.680 --> 02:15:03.240]  Yeah.
[02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:07.720]  Like I said, I, as far as the whole MPK thing, I wouldn't stress it.
[02:15:07.720 --> 02:15:13.080]  I'd make sure that when you, you go into your cycle, make sure your soil's amended properly.
[02:15:13.080 --> 02:15:17.800]  And then, you know, make sure that you're feeding it beneficial bacteria,
[02:15:17.800 --> 02:15:19.720]  that it's getting everything it needs.
[02:15:19.720 --> 02:15:24.520]  If you know, you don't have alfalfa and it'll have kelp in it.
[02:15:24.520 --> 02:15:29.320]  If you need that booster, you can always top dress with like a fish bone meal or make a
[02:15:29.320 --> 02:15:30.840]  nettle tea or a yarrow tea.
[02:15:31.640 --> 02:15:33.480]  There are many different options.
[02:15:33.560 --> 02:15:39.320]  And those, while they may not be high in MPK, that's what they're predominant with.
[02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:42.920]  And that's going to, you know, that's going to get the, you enter that into the soil.
[02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:47.000]  That's going to get the bacteria and the fungi cycling, whatever nutrient you just ingested,
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:48.520]  you know, you entered into the soil.
[02:15:48.520 --> 02:15:51.560]  So they're just going to keep carrying on that process and keep delivering it to your
[02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:53.000]  plant as your plant needs it.
[02:15:54.040 --> 02:15:55.960]  Does your plant know when to stop eating at that point?
[02:15:55.960 --> 02:15:56.600]  Yes.
[02:15:56.600 --> 02:16:01.080]  It'll be like, oh, so you can't, you're not, you don't run as much risk of burning it with
[02:16:01.080 --> 02:16:02.680]  the organics is something I've noticed.
[02:16:02.680 --> 02:16:03.160]  Yeah.
[02:16:03.160 --> 02:16:07.880]  Well, when I was, when I really kind of first got into it, I kept getting a lot of nitrogen
[02:16:07.880 --> 02:16:09.960]  deficiencies at the beginning of flower.
[02:16:09.960 --> 02:16:15.000]  I mean, like every ran I did organic, it would just, for some reason I would just get these
[02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:18.600]  yellow ass leaves, you know, week three and it just, it sucked.
[02:16:19.800 --> 02:16:23.080]  Trying to follow your feed to keep up and do everything you can to chase it.
[02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:23.240]  Yeah.
[02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:26.520]  But in week three, if you're already yellow and it's, it's a lost race.
[02:16:26.520 --> 02:16:31.320]  And I thought that it was because I wasn't feeding the plant enough nitrogen and that
[02:16:31.320 --> 02:16:37.960]  wasn't necessarily the case where I really saw the improvement was when I dialed my amendments
[02:16:37.960 --> 02:16:42.120]  back, you know, when I really slowed things down and was like, okay, I'm not going to
[02:16:42.120 --> 02:16:43.000]  pound it with stuff.
[02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:47.960]  I'm going to make sure that the, you know, soil food web's alive, that everything's cycling
[02:16:47.960 --> 02:16:53.400]  how it needs to, that everything is working and we'll let the plant decide for itself.
[02:16:53.400 --> 02:16:59.000]  And yeah, I mean, I haven't, I haven't seen, you know, any more, I haven't dealt with the
[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:00.280]  deficiency in a while.
[02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:05.400]  I will say that I don't, I haven't ran comparisons.
[02:17:05.400 --> 02:17:08.600]  I don't run when I, I don't run traditional growth.
[02:17:08.600 --> 02:17:12.040]  So I can't say that this is what I'm, you know, you're going to yield compared to this.
[02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:12.280]  Right.
[02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:13.560]  I only do my own thing.
[02:17:13.560 --> 02:17:13.800]  Yeah.
[02:17:15.800 --> 02:17:16.120]  Sorry.
[02:17:16.680 --> 02:17:22.520]  I just trans, I just made the switch back to full organics in my indoor grows.
[02:17:23.560 --> 02:17:25.400]  I had been using bottled nutrients.
[02:17:25.800 --> 02:17:33.160]  And my, my first, I took the clones, my first set of plants that we transplanted into a
[02:17:33.160 --> 02:17:34.360]  good soil and everything.
[02:17:35.560 --> 02:17:38.200]  We never fed them any bottled nutrients or anything like that.
[02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:43.640]  So there wasn't any flushing involved, but I use the soil mix.
[02:17:43.640 --> 02:17:51.000]  That was pretty much what I'd been using previously when I grew indoors and I nitrogen burned
[02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:51.560]  some of them.
[02:17:52.280 --> 02:18:01.080]  Some of them, I think the first half of the plants I transplanted used one amount of all
[02:18:01.080 --> 02:18:04.040]  the inputs and I got yellowing instantly.
[02:18:04.040 --> 02:18:08.360]  And, you know, a lot of people could have been like, oh, that's lack of nitrogen, but
[02:18:08.360 --> 02:18:10.520]  already knew there was a shit ton of nitrogen in there.
[02:18:10.520 --> 02:18:17.160]  So the next night when we transplanted the other half of the plants, I just cut the mountain
[02:18:17.160 --> 02:18:19.400]  half and use the half amount of everything.
[02:18:20.040 --> 02:18:22.360]  And those plants just exploded instantly.
[02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:27.800]  And they're still outgrowing, you know, those spend three weeks ago and they're still out
[02:18:27.800 --> 02:18:31.320]  growing the plants that we transplanted the first night.
[02:18:31.320 --> 02:18:34.520]  So go easy with the organics because they're bioavailable.
[02:18:34.520 --> 02:18:35.640]  The plants are, that's right there.
[02:18:35.640 --> 02:18:36.360]  The plants can eat it.
[02:18:36.360 --> 02:18:39.560]  You don't have to, yeah, they don't have to do as much work to eat that.
[02:18:40.280 --> 02:18:43.480]  So you can speed them up too much by overfeeding them with a lot of these organics.
[02:18:43.480 --> 02:18:46.680]  And that's something we're talking about with one of our favorite products is OGT.
[02:18:47.240 --> 02:18:51.720]  And Sean was teaching me how OGT can kind of speed up the metabolism of your plants
[02:18:51.720 --> 02:18:52.440]  a little bit too much.
[02:18:52.440 --> 02:18:53.880]  So go easy on the OGT guys.
[02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:55.080]  I've been recommending that a lot.
[02:18:56.040 --> 02:18:58.760]  Replace that with Rocky Mountain worm castings if you're able to.
[02:18:58.760 --> 02:19:01.400]  Sean Gillespie I was wondering when I heard, I listened
[02:19:01.400 --> 02:19:08.840]  to the podcast last night, but I was wondering if that could be useful in flushing in any way.
[02:19:08.840 --> 02:19:10.280]  Chris Yeah, you know, it can.
[02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:12.200]  Yeah, it actually absolutely could.
[02:19:12.200 --> 02:19:13.320]  Mike That makes a lot of good sense.
[02:19:13.320 --> 02:19:16.360]  Chris And I know you're a super huge fan of OG BioR.
[02:19:16.360 --> 02:19:18.280]  I started using them here recently.
[02:19:18.280 --> 02:19:21.640]  I am so impressed with OG BioR.
[02:19:21.640 --> 02:19:22.520]  Holy hell.
[02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:29.480]  I mean, I'm talking just from the standpoint of the plant's overall health.
[02:19:29.480 --> 02:19:31.880]  I mean, I haven't seen a damn yellow leaf.
[02:19:31.880 --> 02:19:34.280]  I haven't, everything's green and waxy.
[02:19:34.280 --> 02:19:36.120]  It's, it's pretty cool.
[02:19:36.120 --> 02:19:38.920]  I mean, but the, that goes to the new pack.
[02:19:39.560 --> 02:19:43.480]  I read somewhere that somebody had actually mentioned hitting it because you're only
[02:19:43.480 --> 02:19:47.000]  supposed to use the nutrient pack, I believe three times throughout the whole cycle.
[02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.480]  But I heard him about introducing it a fourth time.
[02:19:49.480 --> 02:19:50.520]  Mike Into flush.
[02:19:50.520 --> 02:19:52.760]  Chris Yeah, about like, or not even into flush.
[02:19:52.760 --> 02:19:57.800]  I think they were saying like around like week, you know, a couple of weeks before flush,
[02:19:57.800 --> 02:19:59.560]  they actually like really start cycling in.
[02:19:59.560 --> 02:20:02.120]  But yeah, I mean, that's definitely something worth looking into.
[02:20:02.120 --> 02:20:02.920]  It's a great idea.
[02:20:02.920 --> 02:20:04.520]  Mike You guys are going to have to start taking
[02:20:04.520 --> 02:20:06.520]  a lot of notes on these next few episodes.
[02:20:06.520 --> 02:20:07.480]  I'm going to have Sean back.
[02:20:07.480 --> 02:20:12.280]  Sean wants to do a full episode on recycling soil and reamending your soil.
[02:20:12.280 --> 02:20:14.280]  We had a listener ask specifically about that.
[02:20:14.280 --> 02:20:15.320]  We're going to get to that one.
[02:20:15.320 --> 02:20:16.520]  Mike That's always been.
[02:20:16.520 --> 02:20:17.800]  Chris Yeah, thanks Fastberry.
[02:20:17.800 --> 02:20:22.440]  I don't know who you are, but you follow, you're an awesome person.
[02:20:22.440 --> 02:20:25.160]  And we really appreciate you listening and appreciate your input.
[02:20:25.160 --> 02:20:29.880]  And I do want to let Jesse talk a little bit or a lot actually about he wants to talk about
[02:20:31.080 --> 02:20:31.880]  light deprivation.
[02:20:31.880 --> 02:20:33.320]  My brain is blank today.
[02:20:33.320 --> 02:20:37.000]  He wants to talk about light deprivation and getting a headstart on the outdoor season.
[02:20:38.440 --> 02:20:41.960]  Sean's got a bomb he wants to drop.
[02:20:41.960 --> 02:20:42.360]  I'm not sure.
[02:20:42.360 --> 02:20:47.320]  Do you want to drop it now or do you want to put people in suspense and give this new idea?
[02:20:47.320 --> 02:20:50.680]  Mike I think that we'll bring it out on the next
[02:20:50.680 --> 02:20:51.160]  episode.
[02:20:51.160 --> 02:20:52.680]  Chris On the next time that Sean comes over,
[02:20:52.680 --> 02:20:57.000]  he's going to talk about reamending recycled soils, and then he's got a bomb to drop on
[02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:58.360]  the entire growing world.
[02:20:58.360 --> 02:21:00.760]  Mike Yeah, you're going to either you're going
[02:21:00.760 --> 02:21:02.200]  to hate me or you're going to love me.
[02:21:02.200 --> 02:21:06.840]  But we're going to change the way you think about a certain item that most people are
[02:21:06.840 --> 02:21:07.480]  using regularly.
[02:21:07.480 --> 02:21:09.640]  Chris Everybody that I know is.
[02:21:09.640 --> 02:21:10.920]  Mike Everybody's using regularly.
[02:21:11.720 --> 02:21:15.400]  I use it regularly in my lineup, so don't think that you know what I mean?
[02:21:15.400 --> 02:21:18.360]  I just learned this too, so I'm guilty of it as well.
[02:21:18.360 --> 02:21:19.640]  Chris All right, then you got probably will
[02:21:19.640 --> 02:21:21.320]  probably give you two weeks to study up on it.
[02:21:21.320 --> 02:21:24.600]  We'll probably skip you on it one episode just because we don't want you too many times
[02:21:24.600 --> 02:21:26.440]  so you don't get stale and expected.
[02:21:26.440 --> 02:21:28.440]  And then we'll do this ash right on the table, bro.
[02:21:28.440 --> 02:21:29.080]  Yeah, perfect.
[02:21:29.080 --> 02:21:29.720]  It fell anyway.
[02:21:30.920 --> 02:21:33.960]  I'm too lazy to get up and get an ashtray, but then we'll have you back and we'll let
[02:21:33.960 --> 02:21:37.880]  you drop that bomb on the show and disrupt everybody's growing methods.
[02:21:37.880 --> 02:21:38.440]  Mike Sounds good.
[02:21:39.400 --> 02:21:42.920]  I've got to do a couple of commercials because I did not do them and we're about to let Jesse
[02:21:42.920 --> 02:21:43.800]  talk a lot.
[02:21:44.360 --> 02:21:45.160]  Our first ad.
[02:21:46.760 --> 02:21:49.480]  First ad is from naturesgreenremedies.com.
[02:21:49.480 --> 02:21:54.120]  Visit naturesgreenremedies.com for Gage Green Genetics, La Plata Labs, Sin City, Rare Dankness,
[02:21:54.120 --> 02:21:59.560]  Mile High, Canaventure, The Cali Connection, MTG, iRegenetics, and many, many more trusted
[02:21:59.560 --> 02:22:00.120]  brands.
[02:22:00.760 --> 02:22:02.920]  I'm not sure what the coupon code is for this month.
[02:22:02.920 --> 02:22:06.200]  I'll try to update you in the next episode, but make sure you check them out.
[02:22:06.760 --> 02:22:07.960]  I saw a coupon code.
[02:22:07.960 --> 02:22:09.160]  Sorry to interrupt you for that.
[02:22:09.160 --> 02:22:09.720]  No, go for it.
[02:22:09.720 --> 02:22:10.440]  Let's hear it.
[02:22:10.440 --> 02:22:14.600]  I can't remember what it was, but it was 25% off and that's a hell of a fucking deal.
[02:22:14.600 --> 02:22:15.000]  Yeah, it is.
[02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:16.200]  If you can find that coupon code.
[02:22:16.200 --> 02:22:18.600]  Yeah, someone on Instagram was talking about it.
[02:22:18.600 --> 02:22:19.000]  There you go.
[02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.160]  Make sure you check out naturesgreenremedies on Instagram.
[02:22:21.160 --> 02:22:25.880]  It's like green remedies nature or naturesgreen or something because Instagram is kind of
[02:22:25.880 --> 02:22:27.480]  a bitch and they've been killing people's pages.
[02:22:27.480 --> 02:22:30.280]  So all right, check them out.
[02:22:30.280 --> 02:22:31.000]  Shout out to Yankee.
[02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:32.360]  I'm sorry I don't have a coupon code for you.
[02:22:32.360 --> 02:22:36.600]  I got to figure out the date that this show posts because if this goes out after February,
[02:22:36.600 --> 02:22:38.840]  which I think it does, then I need a new coupon code.
[02:22:38.840 --> 02:22:39.720]  That's all I'm doing here.
[02:22:39.720 --> 02:22:41.160]  I'll try to post one up at the end of the show.
[02:22:41.160 --> 02:22:42.200]  I'll make a note.
[02:22:42.200 --> 02:22:43.320]  Code is what I'm writing.
[02:22:44.120 --> 02:22:47.960]  Since Jesse's here, this podcast is also brought to you by our good friends at Hydro
[02:22:47.960 --> 02:22:48.840]  Indoor Growing Supplies.
[02:22:48.840 --> 02:22:50.280]  Check out Hydro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[02:22:50.280 --> 02:22:52.440]  They have two locations to serve Colorado.

[02:23:02.520 --> 02:23:04.040]  Say what's up to my friends.
[02:23:04.040 --> 02:23:04.680]  Check out Hygro.
[02:23:04.680 --> 02:23:05.560]  Maybe I'll be there.
[02:23:05.560 --> 02:23:06.840]  Lately, I've been there a lot.
[02:23:06.840 --> 02:23:10.040]  Check out Hygro for competitive pricing and a great selection of indoor grow supplies.
[02:23:10.040 --> 02:23:12.520]  Hygro runs a special for the podcast listeners.
[02:23:12.520 --> 02:23:15.400]  All you have to do is tell them that you listen to the Grow From Your Heart podcast and they
[02:23:15.400 --> 02:23:17.480]  will give you commercial pricing.
[02:23:17.480 --> 02:23:18.920]  I wish I had some cool effects for that.
[02:23:18.920 --> 02:23:20.200]  I'm going to order.
[02:23:20.200 --> 02:23:20.840]  Yes, there you go.
[02:23:20.840 --> 02:23:22.520]  Your whole order, you'll get commercial pricing.
[02:23:23.160 --> 02:23:24.360]  That saves you a few bucks.
[02:23:24.360 --> 02:23:25.720]  Dude, it definitely saves you some money.
[02:23:25.720 --> 02:23:28.680]  If you're buying a big bag of soil, it definitely chops down the price.
[02:23:29.560 --> 02:23:30.760]  I used it today myself.
[02:23:32.120 --> 02:23:34.600]  Saved myself four and a half bucks on a bag of soil.
[02:23:34.600 --> 02:23:36.200]  See, four and a half bucks counts.
[02:23:36.200 --> 02:23:38.360]  It makes it cheaper than everywhere else.
[02:23:38.360 --> 02:23:43.080]  Yeah, that coupon code is actually better than the employee discount I'm supposed to
[02:23:43.080 --> 02:23:43.640]  give myself.
[02:23:45.160 --> 02:23:46.280]  Sweet.
[02:23:46.280 --> 02:23:48.840]  Also, big shout out to Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[02:23:48.840 --> 02:23:53.320]  If you're looking to move to organics, more sustainable gardening, a better way of growing,
[02:23:53.320 --> 02:23:57.560]  a healthier, safer way of farming, a way that will last forever, you'll be able to eliminate
[02:23:57.560 --> 02:24:01.080]  those plastic bottles, eliminate a lot of water shipping, a lot of waste.
[02:24:01.880 --> 02:24:02.840]  It'll be self-sufficient.
[02:24:02.840 --> 02:24:04.440]  Check out the Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.160]  If you have questions about that, check out.
[02:24:07.160 --> 02:24:08.760]  It's at KingCola on Instagram.
[02:24:08.760 --> 02:24:09.800]  How do you spell it actually?
[02:24:09.800 --> 02:24:14.440]  It's at K-I-N-G underscore C-O-L-A.
[02:24:14.440 --> 02:24:14.840]  All right.
[02:24:14.840 --> 02:24:15.640]  I knew there was an underscore.
[02:24:15.640 --> 02:24:19.480]  There's an underscore between the words and at the end, so make sure you check that out.
[02:24:19.480 --> 02:24:21.320]  The big shout out to the Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[02:24:21.320 --> 02:24:23.240]  They're now an official sponsor for the show.
[02:24:23.240 --> 02:24:25.320]  I will write them a really super ad.
[02:24:25.320 --> 02:24:27.480]  I'm just not sure how to advertise that yet.
[02:24:27.480 --> 02:24:29.720]  All the ads sound the same to tell you the truth.
[02:24:29.720 --> 02:24:30.760]  And they're great guys too.
[02:24:30.760 --> 02:24:31.480]  They're great dudes.
[02:24:31.480 --> 02:24:32.840]  We're going to get them back on the show.
[02:24:32.840 --> 02:24:34.520]  In the future, we're going to have the guys from...
[02:24:35.640 --> 02:24:36.920]  I shouldn't even tease you yet.
[02:24:36.920 --> 02:24:40.600]  The Dragonfly Earth Medicine people are going to be on the show pretty soon also.
[02:24:40.600 --> 02:24:42.040]  So we got a lot of cool stuff.
[02:24:42.040 --> 02:24:44.360]  Hunt, Grimey Gatsby, I hope you're listening, dude.
[02:24:44.360 --> 02:24:46.360]  It's time for you to come be on the podcast.
[02:24:46.360 --> 02:24:47.000]  You got to come.

[02:25:16.840 --> 02:25:17.640]  I'm not begging you.
[02:25:17.640 --> 02:25:19.400]  I just want you to know that it's there.
[02:25:19.400 --> 02:25:20.520]  Do that, do that, do that.
[02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:21.240]  Thanks a lot.
[02:25:21.240 --> 02:25:24.920]  So I think it's time to let Jesse talk about light deprivation.
[02:25:24.920 --> 02:25:26.440]  He's got a lot of notes over there.
[02:25:27.320 --> 02:25:30.600]  Um, do you want me to just let you go about it?
[02:25:30.600 --> 02:25:32.680]  Do you want me to ask you a couple of questions I had written down?
[02:25:32.680 --> 02:25:33.880]  How do you think is cool?
[02:25:33.880 --> 02:25:35.160]  You got a good starting point?
[02:25:35.160 --> 02:25:36.360]  Yeah, I got a good starting point.
[02:25:36.360 --> 02:25:37.480]  Well, then get started, bro.
[02:25:38.680 --> 02:25:39.480]  Here comes Jesse.
[02:25:39.480 --> 02:25:42.040]  I actually don't have as many notes as it looks like.
[02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:43.720]  I haven't even read most of this stuff.
[02:25:43.720 --> 02:25:44.520]  This is just...
[02:25:44.520 --> 02:25:45.560]  It's really big print.
[02:25:46.680 --> 02:25:47.480]  It's pretty big.
[02:25:47.480 --> 02:25:50.360]  This top paragraph or three is the important part.
[02:25:51.640 --> 02:25:53.160]  This was written by, um,
[02:25:53.480 --> 02:25:57.480]  either Eric or Jonathan from, uh, Forever Flower and Greenhouses.
[02:25:57.480 --> 02:25:58.760]  Sweet. I was going to shout them out.
[02:25:58.760 --> 02:25:59.560]  Yeah. Yeah.
[02:25:59.560 --> 02:26:00.440]  They're great guys.
[02:26:00.440 --> 02:26:01.160]  Great products.
[02:26:01.160 --> 02:26:06.120]  Um, and I found it on a website called the ganji-air.com,
[02:26:06.120 --> 02:26:07.720]  which is also a great website.
[02:26:07.720 --> 02:26:12.600]  Um, joint break.
[02:26:14.040 --> 02:26:16.200]  So light deprivation, this is just a definition.
[02:26:16.200 --> 02:26:17.000]  That we taste good.
[02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:21.000]  I, uh, yeah, I can taste the Tahoe in there for sure.
[02:26:21.080 --> 02:26:23.960]  I was having trouble and I've always had trouble, uh,
[02:26:24.600 --> 02:26:27.560]  explaining light depth to some people.
[02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:30.760]  So I will use someone else's definition of it.
[02:26:32.200 --> 02:26:34.600]  Light deprivation, AKA light depth,
[02:26:34.600 --> 02:26:37.560]  is the process of forcing plants to flower with sunlight
[02:26:38.440 --> 02:26:41.640]  in a time of year that is not normally the flowering period
[02:26:41.640 --> 02:26:43.720]  of the sun's natural light cycle.
[02:26:44.600 --> 02:26:48.200]  Similar to controlling the light cycle with a light bulb,
[02:26:48.200 --> 02:26:51.880]  similar to controlling the light cycle with a grow light
[02:26:51.880 --> 02:26:53.720]  by turning it on and off with a timer.
[02:26:54.440 --> 02:26:58.120]  Farmers can control the budding cycle by blocking the sunlight
[02:26:58.120 --> 02:26:59.960]  and making the plants think it's time to flower.
[02:27:00.920 --> 02:27:07.640]  Um, typically this is done with a hoop house or greenhouse of some kind.
[02:27:07.640 --> 02:27:10.440]  Um, however, it's not actually necessary.
[02:27:10.440 --> 02:27:16.200]  Um, and, um, I forgot what I lost my track.
[02:27:16.200 --> 02:27:16.440]  All right.
[02:27:16.520 --> 02:27:19.000]  So I'll recap a little, I'll recap a little while you catch up.
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.640]  Uh, basically what we're trying to do, we want to grow outside,
[02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:24.120]  but we want to get a little bit of a jump on the outdoor season
[02:27:24.120 --> 02:27:28.200]  before the police and thieves go looking for the outdoor crops.
[02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:31.960]  So our trick is to build a greenhouse outside or a hoop house,
[02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:33.720]  which I'll let Jesse explain how to build a hoop house.
[02:27:33.720 --> 02:27:34.600]  He's our construction guy.
[02:27:34.600 --> 02:27:38.680]  He's got a beard and a hammer and a truck.
[02:27:38.680 --> 02:27:42.920]  So basically what we need to do, we want to put our plants outside
[02:27:42.920 --> 02:27:43.640]  and outside.
[02:27:44.520 --> 02:27:47.800]  We'll put them out early before we get to our flowering cycle
[02:27:47.800 --> 02:27:50.360]  that nature gives us with the sun, the sun cycles.
[02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:52.440]  The photo period is what makes these plants flower.
[02:27:52.440 --> 02:27:53.480]  So we're going to trick them.
[02:27:53.480 --> 02:27:57.240]  We're going to cover up our outdoor greenhouse or hoop house.
[02:27:57.240 --> 02:28:00.120]  We're going to cover that up every day at the same time
[02:28:00.120 --> 02:28:04.280]  and let them sleep for 12 hours and then uncover it every morning at the same time
[02:28:04.280 --> 02:28:08.120]  so that these plants are tricked into thinking that the season has changed to fall
[02:28:08.120 --> 02:28:10.280]  and it's time for them to flower.
[02:28:10.280 --> 02:28:12.600]  So maybe we can do this with the,
[02:28:12.600 --> 02:28:14.840]  if you schedule it right, you can get these going four weeks,
[02:28:14.840 --> 02:28:18.120]  maybe three or four weeks before everybody else's in flower.
[02:28:18.120 --> 02:28:21.960]  You can pull off one crop before everybody else and that shit won't get stolen.
[02:28:22.520 --> 02:28:23.080]  Here you can,
[02:28:24.200 --> 02:28:26.760]  shit, I have it all figured out because I'm doing it myself.
[02:28:27.720 --> 02:28:34.120]  If you put your plants out April 25th here, you will harvest July 30th, I want to say.
[02:28:34.120 --> 02:28:34.920]  Wow, that's early.
[02:28:34.920 --> 02:28:35.400]  Yeah.
[02:28:35.400 --> 02:28:39.400]  Yeah, because nobody gets a harvest till late September, early October, mid October.
[02:28:39.400 --> 02:28:41.320]  Yeah. And that's with the 65 day strain.
[02:28:42.040 --> 02:28:42.840]  You know, so.
[02:28:42.840 --> 02:28:44.600]  And you're not going to worry about any cold.
[02:28:44.600 --> 02:28:47.000]  You're not going to get that freeze that everybody worries about.
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:50.360]  But you know, in our region, possibly a little bit in the early season.
[02:28:50.360 --> 02:28:53.800]  You can put plants back in there and re-flower them, couldn't you?
[02:28:53.800 --> 02:28:54.600]  You can actually.
[02:28:54.600 --> 02:28:56.040]  You can get two runs out of that.
[02:28:56.040 --> 02:28:57.240]  Yeah, two runs easily.
[02:28:58.120 --> 02:28:59.480]  I've seen three runs.
[02:28:59.480 --> 02:29:00.040]  Nice.
[02:29:00.040 --> 02:29:03.640]  So actually I've seen four runs, but that was with a forever flowering greenhouse.
[02:29:03.640 --> 02:29:04.600]  Yeah, forever flowering.
[02:29:05.560 --> 02:29:08.360]  So a hoop house or a small greenhouse is the way to go.
[02:29:08.360 --> 02:29:10.360]  If you guys are trying to do this on a small level,
[02:29:10.440 --> 02:29:14.920]  the smallest level of light deprivation I think you could do, put a couple of potted plants.
[02:29:16.840 --> 02:29:18.520]  Try to use a seven gallon or bigger.
[02:29:18.520 --> 02:29:19.240]  At least.
[02:29:19.240 --> 02:29:19.960]  Yeah, at least.
[02:29:19.960 --> 02:29:24.120]  But I mean, some people, you know, this is for the guy that's just trying to do one plant for himself or whatever.
[02:29:24.120 --> 02:29:24.440]  Yeah.
[02:29:24.440 --> 02:29:25.320]  Put your seven gallon.
[02:29:25.320 --> 02:29:27.560]  A lot of guys are going to use a five gallon bucket from Home Depot.
[02:29:27.560 --> 02:29:28.840]  You know, that's what they're going to go get.
[02:29:28.840 --> 02:29:29.400]  44.
[02:29:30.040 --> 02:29:31.320]  What's up 44?
[02:29:31.320 --> 02:29:34.600]  So 44, you take your, and 44 was kind of doing this last year.
[02:29:34.600 --> 02:29:38.120]  You take your five gallon Home Depot bucket with your big ass plant in there.
[02:29:38.120 --> 02:29:41.560]  And every day at six o'clock or every day at seven o'clock, whatever time you choose,
[02:29:41.560 --> 02:29:43.880]  you got to pay attention to what time the sun goes down.
[02:29:44.520 --> 02:29:47.240]  Get that plant and go put it in a closet in the house.
[02:29:47.240 --> 02:29:49.000]  Just put it back in your grow room.
[02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:50.440]  Yeah, put it in your grow room or whatever.
[02:29:50.440 --> 02:29:51.800]  If it's a small operation.
[02:29:51.800 --> 02:29:52.520]  Yeah.
[02:29:52.520 --> 02:29:55.560]  Just put it in the room for the night and let it sleep every night at the same time.
[02:29:55.560 --> 02:29:59.800]  And then it has to go back outside under the sun every night or every day at the same time.
[02:29:59.800 --> 02:30:04.200]  As long as you give that plant 12 hours of consistent, 12 hours of darkness uninterrupted
[02:30:04.200 --> 02:30:09.320]  every night, you can do a light depth like that and use the sun and a closet for your grow area.
[02:30:09.320 --> 02:30:09.640]  44.
[02:30:09.640 --> 02:30:10.440]  Here's the trick too.
[02:30:11.480 --> 02:30:14.440]  You don't actually have to put it back out at the same time.
[02:30:15.080 --> 02:30:23.320]  Just look to wait for 10, 11 o'clock at night, safe time, sun completely down, no lumens.
[02:30:23.320 --> 02:30:24.840]  Oh, genius.
[02:30:24.840 --> 02:30:25.080]  44.
[02:30:25.080 --> 02:30:30.200]  And then use your farmer's almond act to find out what time the sun goes up that morning.
[02:30:30.200 --> 02:30:30.520]  There you go.
[02:30:30.520 --> 02:30:30.680]  Yeah.
[02:30:31.400 --> 02:30:37.720]  And typically you're probably getting your first actual, this is from Jonathan of Forever
[02:30:37.720 --> 02:30:38.600]  Flowering, actually.
[02:30:38.600 --> 02:30:44.520]  I'm not this smart, but you get your first lumens probably before the sun actually comes up.
[02:30:44.520 --> 02:30:45.080]  Yes.
[02:30:45.080 --> 02:30:47.880]  So, you know, take 20 minutes off that time.
[02:30:47.880 --> 02:30:48.920]  Okay.
[02:30:48.920 --> 02:30:55.960]  But yeah, that's, I've done it before the old fashion or the other way of, you know,
[02:30:55.960 --> 02:30:58.440]  seven and seven and it's very tedious.
[02:30:58.440 --> 02:30:59.400]  Yeah.
[02:30:59.400 --> 02:30:59.640]  Yeah.
[02:30:59.640 --> 02:31:02.120]  So you can take it back outside guys, bring it in.
[02:31:02.120 --> 02:31:05.480]  Uh, if the sun's going to set at eight o'clock and bring that plan in at seven o'clock, let
[02:31:05.480 --> 02:31:09.320]  it chill out before you go to bed at 11 or 12, go put it back outside because it's nighttime
[02:31:09.320 --> 02:31:11.160]  or you got to find out what time the sun's going to come up.
[02:31:11.160 --> 02:31:11.400]  Yeah.
[02:31:11.400 --> 02:31:14.120]  You know, it's going to be six 37 o'clock in the summer, probably.
[02:31:14.120 --> 02:31:14.520]  Exactly.
[02:31:14.520 --> 02:31:15.400]  Depending on where you are.
[02:31:15.400 --> 02:31:15.880]  Yeah.
[02:31:15.880 --> 02:31:16.280]  Yeah.
[02:31:16.280 --> 02:31:17.560]  That's a good, good idea right there.
[02:31:17.560 --> 02:31:18.760]  And that's basically free.
[02:31:19.320 --> 02:31:19.960]  Yeah.
[02:31:19.960 --> 02:31:22.360]  You got to buy a pot, a big ass pot.
[02:31:22.360 --> 02:31:23.320]  You got to buy some soil.
[02:31:23.320 --> 02:31:24.840]  You got to buy some Rocky mountain worms.
[02:31:24.840 --> 02:31:25.960]  You got to buy some grow Kashi.
[02:31:25.960 --> 02:31:27.400]  You need some dragonfly earth medicine.
[02:31:27.960 --> 02:31:29.160]  A lot of cool other shit.
[02:31:29.160 --> 02:31:30.600]  Some as a mite a little bit, mix that up.
[02:31:30.600 --> 02:31:33.000]  Sean's going to teach you what to put in your soil in a couple of episodes.
[02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:37.160]  Put all that shit in a pot, put a nice clone of some grateful dog in there.
[02:31:37.960 --> 02:31:39.480]  Throw that sucker outside.
[02:31:39.480 --> 02:31:39.880]  Yep.
[02:31:39.880 --> 02:31:40.680]  You can do it.
[02:31:40.680 --> 02:31:41.880]  That's free weed.
[02:31:41.880 --> 02:31:47.240]  Um, I mean, you could use a garage, a shed, you know, anything, if it's just a couple of
[02:31:47.240 --> 02:31:48.680]  plants, old grow tent.
[02:31:48.680 --> 02:31:51.240]  I've seen people take a big ass trash can.
[02:31:51.240 --> 02:31:54.760]  If you've got a little plant, you take a little big 30 something gallon trash can drill some
[02:31:54.760 --> 02:31:57.880]  holes in the bottom of it so that you got airflow and then just set that bitch right
[02:31:57.880 --> 02:31:58.600]  on top of it.
[02:31:58.600 --> 02:31:59.240]  Yeah.
[02:31:59.240 --> 02:32:02.840]  I've seen him do that for hail storms, but also seen him do that for a shitty light depth.
[02:32:02.840 --> 02:32:03.400]  It'll work.
[02:32:03.400 --> 02:32:05.000]  I mean, I'm sure it'd work.
[02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:05.400]  It'll work.
[02:32:05.400 --> 02:32:08.440]  It's not going to be, you know, it's not going to be the most amazing, but it's what you got.
[02:32:08.440 --> 02:32:12.120]  So, uh, do you want to teach these guys how to do a hoop house?
[02:32:12.120 --> 02:32:12.360]  Yeah.
[02:32:12.360 --> 02:32:15.160]  Just like a quick, since you're, since you're the man with the hammer and all.
[02:32:15.160 --> 02:32:19.560]  A real simple one is just, you need a gravel pad or an elevated area.
[02:32:19.560 --> 02:32:22.840]  Um, I mean, you don't need it, but you need drainage.
[02:32:22.840 --> 02:32:25.640]  Uh, it keeps it from being a muddy mass.
[02:32:25.640 --> 02:32:26.040]  Jesus.
[02:32:26.040 --> 02:32:26.840]  I'm stoned again.
[02:32:29.480 --> 02:32:33.160]  Um, I made the mistake of not smoking all day before coming at Jeff's.
[02:32:34.920 --> 02:32:38.280]  When you show up at my spot, it's dad time to get a pregame.
[02:32:38.280 --> 02:32:38.520]  Yeah.
[02:32:38.520 --> 02:32:39.240]  You got to warm up.
[02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:45.800]  But yeah, I mean, take two by fours, lay them down on the ground, uh, screw them to each
[02:32:45.800 --> 02:32:50.840]  other, make a big rectangle, um, eight foot by let's say 12 foot.
[02:32:51.480 --> 02:32:58.920]  Um, so you need to eight foot, two by fours to 12 foot, two by fours, um, make a rectangle
[02:32:58.920 --> 02:33:01.080]  pretty much handful of screws.
[02:33:01.080 --> 02:33:04.520]  Um, build that, stake it to the ground.
[02:33:04.520 --> 02:33:06.760]  Um, lots of different ways to do that.
[02:33:06.760 --> 02:33:13.560]  A piece of rebar or something, and then Nell, the, you know, now the rebar to the, uh, um,
[02:33:15.320 --> 02:33:18.200]  to the two by four with a fence staple or something like that.
[02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:22.360]  Um, and then take you, let's see, eight or 12 foot.
[02:33:23.880 --> 02:33:24.840]  He's counting.
[02:33:24.840 --> 02:33:26.760]  He's doing, he's doing construction math.
[02:33:26.760 --> 02:33:37.000]  I'd say at least six, uh, pieces of, um, at least two inch PVC, um, would need to be
[02:33:39.240 --> 02:33:43.160]  at least 12 or 14 foot long, I think to make the entire hoop over.
[02:33:43.160 --> 02:33:43.400]  Okay.
[02:33:43.640 --> 02:33:50.760]  Um, at the front you'll screw, basically you're just going to bend the PVC into hoop.
[02:33:50.760 --> 02:33:50.920]  Yeah.
[02:33:50.920 --> 02:33:51.800]  Into a half circle.
[02:33:51.800 --> 02:33:52.040]  Yeah.
[02:33:52.040 --> 02:33:55.320]  So you're making kind of a, it just looks like a really cheap greenhouse.
[02:33:55.320 --> 02:33:55.560]  Yeah.
[02:33:55.560 --> 02:33:55.960]  Yeah.
[02:33:55.960 --> 02:34:01.400]  And then you use some clamps, um, uh, like some conduit clamps.
[02:34:01.400 --> 02:34:05.560]  You can even just screw straight through the PVC into the, but I mean, you got to secure
[02:34:05.560 --> 02:34:06.840]  it to the two by four somehow.
[02:34:07.480 --> 02:34:11.160]  So, um, for a 12 foot greenhouse, I'd put up.
[02:34:12.520 --> 02:34:18.760]  Four of those pieces of PVC or four hoops, and then use one as a skeleton beam down the
[02:34:18.760 --> 02:34:23.640]  middle that that would be at the peak, um, attach it with zip ties or something like that.
[02:34:24.440 --> 02:34:30.360]  Um, if you're in a really windy area, um, you'll probably want to beef up your material a little,
[02:34:31.240 --> 02:34:31.800]  yeah.
[02:34:31.800 --> 02:34:33.960]  Um, like the front range, Colorado.
[02:34:34.920 --> 02:34:40.920]  But, um, and then, you know, just throw some plastic over it and, uh, boom, you got a greenhouse.
[02:34:42.200 --> 02:34:42.920]  It's pretty simple.
[02:34:43.560 --> 02:34:45.880]  Some thin see-through plastic right over it.
[02:34:45.880 --> 02:34:46.440]  Yeah.
[02:34:46.440 --> 02:34:49.400]  And then you've got a weatherproof, a weather resistant greenhouse.
[02:34:49.400 --> 02:34:49.880]  Yeah.
[02:34:49.880 --> 02:34:54.440]  And then, so now you basically built this big rectangle, you've secured the rectangle to the
[02:34:54.440 --> 02:34:54.760]  ground.
[02:34:55.320 --> 02:35:01.000]  Uh, and then we took PVC and made arches and then he just made one, two, three, four, so
[02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:01.880]  arches.
[02:35:01.880 --> 02:35:04.840]  You got one at each end and then a couple in the middle, and then you take that one right
[02:35:04.840 --> 02:35:05.560]  down the center.
[02:35:05.560 --> 02:35:06.040]  Yeah.
[02:35:06.040 --> 02:35:10.120]  And then we just drape plastic and secure the plastic at each on the bottom on each
[02:35:10.120 --> 02:35:10.360]  side.
[02:35:11.240 --> 02:35:14.120]  And then, uh, do you let it hang and you get, make some on the front and back too?
[02:35:14.120 --> 02:35:15.960]  Or do you just leave the front and back open?
[02:35:15.960 --> 02:35:18.840]  If you're wanting to do it cheap, I just really recommend leaving them open.
[02:35:18.840 --> 02:35:19.320]  Okay.
[02:35:19.320 --> 02:35:20.520]  You get some airflow in there.
[02:35:20.520 --> 02:35:20.680]  Yeah.
[02:35:20.680 --> 02:35:23.880]  You're not going to get, unless it rains totally sideways, you should be legit, right?
[02:35:23.880 --> 02:35:24.120]  Yeah.
[02:35:24.120 --> 02:35:26.680]  I mean, you can have the plastic.
[02:35:27.640 --> 02:35:29.640]  Now that greenhouse is good all year, right?
[02:35:29.720 --> 02:35:33.320]  Like you can use that for, if you don't want to do light depth, that's a perfect cheap
[02:35:33.320 --> 02:35:33.960]  little hoop house.
[02:35:33.960 --> 02:35:37.480]  You can put a bunch of cannabis in there and eight by 12, you can put a lot of pots in
[02:35:37.480 --> 02:35:37.720]  there.
[02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:37.960]  Yeah.
[02:35:37.960 --> 02:35:38.280]  A lot.
[02:35:38.280 --> 02:35:38.600]  Fuck yeah.
[02:35:38.600 --> 02:35:39.320]  Okay.
[02:35:39.320 --> 02:35:42.680]  So guys get, get some seeds going or get some clones cut now because you're going to want
[02:35:42.680 --> 02:35:44.600]  to get these suckers outside pretty soon.
[02:35:44.600 --> 02:35:45.000]  Yeah.
[02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:46.440]  Like this is real time stuff.
[02:35:47.320 --> 02:35:48.520]  Vegem inside.
[02:35:48.520 --> 02:35:53.960]  Uh, we haven't actually addressed this, uh, but Vegem inside to the size that you would
[02:35:53.960 --> 02:35:57.400]  normally flip a plant, um, or even fucking bigger.
[02:35:58.200 --> 02:35:59.320]  Top them a few times.
[02:35:59.320 --> 02:36:00.040]  Femm them if you can.
[02:36:00.040 --> 02:36:00.440]  Yeah.
[02:36:00.440 --> 02:36:04.440]  Our light depth plants are fucking gigantic.
[02:36:04.440 --> 02:36:06.600]  I mean, um, and they're terpy.
[02:36:06.600 --> 02:36:07.560]  They taste good.
[02:36:07.560 --> 02:36:10.120]  They're as big as an outdoor plant.
[02:36:10.120 --> 02:36:16.360]  Um, when it's start, starts flowering outdoors, you know, an in-ground traditional or natural,
[02:36:16.360 --> 02:36:17.640]  uh, light cycle plant.
[02:36:18.360 --> 02:36:25.160]  So that's, I mean, the yield is, uh, I'm not going to say numbers, but it, it's, it's very
[02:36:25.160 --> 02:36:25.800]  much worth it.
[02:36:25.800 --> 02:36:26.520]  Oh, if you do it right.
[02:36:26.520 --> 02:36:26.680]  Yeah.
[02:36:26.680 --> 02:36:28.440]  This will definitely pay for itself.
[02:36:28.440 --> 02:36:28.760]  Definitely.
[02:36:28.760 --> 02:36:30.680]  And that outdoor cannabis is so good.
[02:36:30.680 --> 02:36:30.840]  Yeah.
[02:36:30.840 --> 02:36:31.880]  It's definitely good.
[02:36:31.880 --> 02:36:32.520]  It tastes good.
[02:36:32.520 --> 02:36:35.720]  It's well-grown and then, uh, does amazing things.
[02:36:35.720 --> 02:36:40.520]  Greenhouse cannabis, uh, you know, has been protected from the wind and rain.
[02:36:40.520 --> 02:36:42.840]  So it's a lot more frosty.
[02:36:42.840 --> 02:36:45.560]  Your, uh, looks a little more like indoor weed.
[02:36:45.560 --> 02:36:45.800]  Yeah.
[02:36:46.760 --> 02:36:48.760]  I think greenhouse weed is my favorite.
[02:36:49.560 --> 02:36:50.360]  Yeah, for sure.
[02:36:50.360 --> 02:36:50.520]  Yeah.
[02:36:50.520 --> 02:36:53.160]  I, I honestly prefer it to indoor.
[02:36:53.160 --> 02:36:54.040]  Sunterps.
[02:36:54.040 --> 02:36:54.520]  Exactly.
[02:36:54.520 --> 02:36:55.560]  You can't match that.
[02:36:55.560 --> 02:36:55.960]  Sun.
[02:36:55.960 --> 02:36:56.200]  Yeah.
[02:36:56.280 --> 02:36:57.720]  That controlled environment.
[02:36:57.720 --> 02:36:57.960]  All right.
[02:36:57.960 --> 02:37:01.000]  So we've got this hoop house and it's pretty much weather resistant.
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:02.440]  It's eight by 12.
[02:37:02.440 --> 02:37:04.840]  Uh, how tall does it usually end up about seven, eight feet tall?
[02:37:04.840 --> 02:37:06.360]  It's usually about where we are.
[02:37:06.360 --> 02:37:06.600]  Yeah.
[02:37:06.600 --> 02:37:06.760]  Yeah.
[02:37:06.760 --> 02:37:10.040]  The, uh, the one I was thinking of in my head would be about seven feet tall.
[02:37:10.040 --> 02:37:10.360]  Okay.
[02:37:10.360 --> 02:37:10.600]  Yeah.
[02:37:10.600 --> 02:37:12.760]  I've been in the one that I've pretty much been in one that you've built.
[02:37:12.760 --> 02:37:14.200]  I've been into it side by side.
[02:37:14.200 --> 02:37:14.440]  Yeah.
[02:37:14.440 --> 02:37:15.960]  I know exactly what we're dealing with here.
[02:37:15.960 --> 02:37:19.560]  You can get some big ass being your plants can finish seven feet tall in here.
[02:37:19.560 --> 02:37:21.320]  You can get gigantic with this.
[02:37:21.320 --> 02:37:23.080]  I've seen some guys in NorCal.
[02:37:23.080 --> 02:37:29.640]  Um, I mean, they have scissor lifts to, uh, pull the plastic over and shit like that.
[02:37:29.640 --> 02:37:31.320]  They're just, all right.
[02:37:31.320 --> 02:37:32.760]  So that's the part we're going to have to talk about.
[02:37:32.760 --> 02:37:34.760]  Now we're trying to make this light depth.
[02:37:34.760 --> 02:37:39.480]  So we're going to put our plants out there when they're waist high ish, maybe a little
[02:37:39.480 --> 02:37:40.760]  higher, maybe I'm tall.
[02:37:40.760 --> 02:37:42.680]  So I can't really judge by that.
[02:37:42.680 --> 02:37:48.680]  I guess when they're about 36 to 42 inches tall, you want to start inducing flower.
[02:37:48.680 --> 02:37:49.880]  And now we can't just flip the light.
[02:37:49.880 --> 02:37:51.960]  Like we used to indoors to 12, 12.
[02:37:51.960 --> 02:37:53.000]  Now we've got to do it.
[02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.640]  Like Jesse was saying, we've got to use some sort of cover.
[02:37:55.640 --> 02:37:57.080]  We got to use some kind of tarp.
[02:37:57.080 --> 02:38:01.160]  So you need, if you've got, if your greenhouse is 12 feet long and eight feet wide, you're
[02:38:01.160 --> 02:38:04.440]  going to need like 12 by 12, at least to cover it because that arch is going to take a lot
[02:38:04.440 --> 02:38:06.840]  more space, probably 12 by 15 or so.
[02:38:06.840 --> 02:38:07.240]  Right.
[02:38:07.240 --> 02:38:07.400]  Yeah.
[02:38:07.960 --> 02:38:08.520]  Yeah.
[02:38:08.520 --> 02:38:10.200]  So just get a 15 by 15 tarp.
[02:38:10.200 --> 02:38:11.640]  Does that you have plenty of coverage?
[02:38:12.280 --> 02:38:13.000]  Um, yeah.
[02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:16.920]  And make sure it's actually, uh, it actually blocks out the sun.
[02:38:16.920 --> 02:38:17.000]  Yeah.
[02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:18.280]  You might have to use two layers.
[02:38:18.840 --> 02:38:25.720]  Um, I have used, I get green tarps, um, cause of the green spectrum, uh, supposedly, you
[02:38:25.720 --> 02:38:32.200]  know, um, I don't know if that's, yeah, I don't know about the science behind that.
[02:38:32.200 --> 02:38:35.000]  That's just, I was standing in there and I was like, green tarp.
[02:38:36.360 --> 02:38:39.480]  The point is to keep out all of the light because you need it dark.
[02:38:39.480 --> 02:38:43.800]  So whatever time you pick every night, if you pick seven o'clock, you got to figure
[02:38:43.800 --> 02:38:45.240]  out what time the sun's going to come up.
[02:38:45.240 --> 02:38:49.080]  If you pick seven o'clock, you got to go out to this hoop house every night and cover
[02:38:49.080 --> 02:38:50.840]  it up with a tarp.
[02:38:50.840 --> 02:38:52.120]  So it's completely dark.
[02:38:52.120 --> 02:38:56.920]  The first few times you do it, go in there and hang out, wait for like 40 minutes, just
[02:38:56.920 --> 02:39:00.680]  lay down and hang out for a little bit, close your eyes and adjust to the dark.
[02:39:00.680 --> 02:39:04.760]  And then if you can see any light, if you can see any light in there, it's too much
[02:39:04.760 --> 02:39:05.000]  light.
[02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:06.040]  You got to make it darker.
[02:39:06.040 --> 02:39:08.120]  I continuously do that through the season.
[02:39:08.120 --> 02:39:08.600]  Yeah.
[02:39:08.600 --> 02:39:08.920]  Yeah.
[02:39:08.920 --> 02:39:15.080]  So it's, um, with tarps and cheaper material, I mean, you forever flowering makes
[02:39:15.080 --> 02:39:15.880]  really nice stuff.
[02:39:16.440 --> 02:39:16.600]  Yeah.
[02:39:16.600 --> 02:39:19.800]  If you've got, if you've got some money to spend and some land to put it on, check out
[02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:21.160]  forever flowering greenhouses.
[02:39:21.160 --> 02:39:23.240]  Well, yeah, but it's not your backyard set up though.
[02:39:23.240 --> 02:39:27.800]  You can get just the greenhouse fabrics from them and they're actually not too expensive.
[02:39:27.800 --> 02:39:28.760]  I'm going to do it this year.
[02:39:29.880 --> 02:39:32.360]  And they also have a blackout tarp that's breathable.
[02:39:32.360 --> 02:39:37.240]  So, um, you know, that's, and it's not too much just order the tarp from them.
[02:39:37.240 --> 02:39:43.560]  Um, so if you can afford that, that, um, otherwise, yeah, yeah, please.
[02:39:45.080 --> 02:39:45.800]  We want hats.
[02:39:47.160 --> 02:39:48.840]  I'm trying to close a deal for you, man.
[02:39:50.360 --> 02:39:55.880]  Um, but, uh, uh, damn, I lost my train of thought thinking about their bitching hat
[02:39:55.880 --> 02:39:56.520]  covering it up.
[02:39:56.520 --> 02:39:57.080]  Get dark.
[02:39:57.080 --> 02:39:57.880]  Oh yeah.
[02:39:57.880 --> 02:39:58.840]  Cheap plastic.
[02:39:58.840 --> 02:40:00.760]  It's going to tear throughout the season.
[02:40:00.760 --> 02:40:06.360]  Um, so, you know, uh, continuously check it, have extra plastic.
[02:40:06.840 --> 02:40:10.840]  Um, I put plastic, I put the tarp and then plastic over it.
[02:40:10.840 --> 02:40:14.280]  So, um, to make sure I get a total blackout.
[02:40:14.280 --> 02:40:14.680]  Okay.
[02:40:15.080 --> 02:40:15.240]  Yeah.
[02:40:15.240 --> 02:40:16.520]  So you can't have any light in there.
[02:40:16.520 --> 02:40:17.400]  That's our point guys.
[02:40:17.400 --> 02:40:21.160]  So every night, this is the whole time you're doing this every night.
[02:40:21.160 --> 02:40:24.120]  Somebody, hopefully you, hopefully you've got the dedication.
[02:40:24.120 --> 02:40:27.320]  Somebody has got to go out there every night and make this shit dark.
[02:40:27.320 --> 02:40:31.480]  And then every morning you have to go out there and turn the lights on by uncovering it.
[02:40:31.480 --> 02:40:31.720]  Yeah.
[02:40:31.720 --> 02:40:32.520]  And you're going to get some air.
[02:40:32.520 --> 02:40:34.920]  You're going to have to get airflow in there while it's covered up.
[02:40:34.920 --> 02:40:37.880]  So think about a way to, to get airflow in there while you're covered.
[02:40:37.880 --> 02:40:39.560]  You might need a fan towards the floor.
[02:40:39.560 --> 02:40:39.800]  Yeah.
[02:40:39.800 --> 02:40:40.760]  It's an air in and out.
[02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:46.920]  A trick I use for that is, um, this also helps keep everything secure.
[02:40:46.920 --> 02:40:47.720]  Sean's dedicated.
[02:40:47.720 --> 02:40:49.880]  He just pulled out forever flower stickers.
[02:40:49.880 --> 02:40:50.760]  Oh, nice.
[02:40:50.760 --> 02:40:51.800]  And a business card.
[02:40:51.800 --> 02:40:52.440]  There you go.
[02:40:52.440 --> 02:40:53.080]  Yeah.
[02:40:53.080 --> 02:40:54.680]  Help you get in touch with them for sure.
[02:40:54.680 --> 02:40:55.160]  Tell them.
[02:40:55.160 --> 02:40:55.800]  Yeah.
[02:40:55.800 --> 02:40:56.840]  I send you.
[02:40:56.840 --> 02:40:57.160]  Yeah.
[02:40:58.360 --> 02:41:02.120]  Um, I met him once kind of, so yeah.
[02:41:03.640 --> 02:41:04.600]  In a dab session.
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:08.520]  Um, it was, uh, when they were through the greener side one time.
[02:41:08.520 --> 02:41:08.840]  Yeah.
[02:41:08.840 --> 02:41:10.120]  No smoking allowed there.
[02:41:10.120 --> 02:41:10.280]  Yeah.
[02:41:11.320 --> 02:41:12.360]  Oh yeah, of course.
[02:41:13.800 --> 02:41:17.160]  But, uh, uh, uh, shit, I lost my train of thought.
[02:41:17.160 --> 02:41:18.040]  You're good at that.
[02:41:18.040 --> 02:41:18.360]  Dude.
[02:41:18.360 --> 02:41:21.080]  Was that like some sativa or something in those tabs?
[02:41:21.080 --> 02:41:24.600]  Uh, yes, that was actually some lemon Jeffrey sour diesel dab.
[02:41:24.600 --> 02:41:25.720]  You gotta warn me about that.
[02:41:26.440 --> 02:41:28.040]  I'm not a sativa smoker.
[02:41:28.040 --> 02:41:28.760]  You are today.
[02:41:29.400 --> 02:41:31.000]  I'm sitting here losing my shit, man.
[02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:32.440]  He's kind of wiggling around.
[02:41:32.440 --> 02:41:32.920]  Yeah.
[02:41:32.920 --> 02:41:33.160]  Yeah.
[02:41:33.160 --> 02:41:34.360]  It's so hard to sit still.
[02:41:34.360 --> 02:41:36.120]  You guys would be proud of me.
[02:41:36.120 --> 02:41:37.960]  That's why I couldn't sleep last night.
[02:41:37.960 --> 02:41:40.440]  I was dabbing this stuff, just going, I'm trying to get tired.
[02:41:40.520 --> 02:41:41.560]  It's not working.
[02:41:41.560 --> 02:41:42.040]  Yeah.
[02:41:42.040 --> 02:41:42.600]  Dabbing it.
[02:41:44.040 --> 02:41:44.200]  Yeah.
[02:41:44.200 --> 02:41:45.800]  I'm totally an indica guy.
[02:41:45.800 --> 02:41:46.120]  Okay.
[02:41:46.120 --> 02:41:47.080]  I'll remember that.
[02:41:47.080 --> 02:41:48.600]  Um, shit.
[02:41:48.600 --> 02:41:49.640]  I lost my train of thought.
[02:41:50.200 --> 02:41:52.040]  That's going to be the name of this episode.
[02:41:52.040 --> 02:41:53.800]  Jesse lost his train of thought.
[02:41:53.800 --> 02:41:56.840]  Um, but yeah, no, just, uh, I'll remember.
[02:41:56.840 --> 02:41:58.200]  Uh, light depth is awesome.
[02:41:58.200 --> 02:42:01.000]  You were, you were just kind of talking about what fabric and stuff you were going to.
[02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:01.880]  Ventilation.
[02:42:01.880 --> 02:42:02.200]  Yeah.
[02:42:02.200 --> 02:42:07.320]  Um, I'll take a booster fan, like a 10 inch or 12 inch one.
[02:42:07.320 --> 02:42:08.760]  Um, and.
[02:42:09.960 --> 02:42:13.160]  Hook the ducting to it, um, tie it to the side of the greenhouse.
[02:42:13.160 --> 02:42:14.200]  So it's up off the ground.
[02:42:14.200 --> 02:42:16.600]  It doesn't suck any dirt or anything into the fan.
[02:42:17.240 --> 02:42:22.600]  Um, set that on the floor of the greenhouse, uh, plug it in, pull your tarp, uh, hook to
[02:42:22.600 --> 02:42:28.440]  that, have like a six foot chunk of ducting and pull that out, wrap the plastic around
[02:42:28.440 --> 02:42:28.680]  it.
[02:42:28.680 --> 02:42:29.320]  There you go.
[02:42:29.320 --> 02:42:33.160]  And make it do a couple of S's on the ground and all that good stuff.
[02:42:33.160 --> 02:42:33.320]  Yeah.
[02:42:33.320 --> 02:42:36.600]  The S's are so the light comes in, you got to bend your ducting to keep the lights out.
[02:42:36.600 --> 02:42:39.480]  I know everybody tells you to keep your ducting straight, but at this time you got to bend
[02:42:39.480 --> 02:42:39.560]  it.
[02:42:39.560 --> 02:42:40.760]  That's how you keep light out.
[02:42:40.760 --> 02:42:45.880]  And that puts a, um, negative pressure on the greenhouse to help suck the tarp nice
[02:42:45.880 --> 02:42:46.680]  and tight.
[02:42:46.680 --> 02:42:47.080]  Yeah.
[02:42:47.080 --> 02:42:48.360]  If you've got it sealed up good.
[02:42:48.360 --> 02:42:48.920]  Okay.
[02:42:48.920 --> 02:42:49.240]  Yeah.
[02:42:49.240 --> 02:42:50.280]  That's a good idea.
[02:42:50.280 --> 02:42:57.400]  Uh, use some, uh, some timbers, rocks, whatever that is or whatever, um, to hold the tarp
[02:42:57.400 --> 02:42:57.880]  down.
[02:42:57.880 --> 02:43:05.160]  Um, you know, once you pull it over, uh, you can have sandbags, um, but that'll be on the
[02:43:05.160 --> 02:43:06.200]  edges on the ground.
[02:43:06.280 --> 02:43:10.680]  Something heavy enough to keep wind from lifting, taking your tarp away, giving you sunlight
[02:43:10.680 --> 02:43:11.560]  when you don't need it.
[02:43:11.560 --> 02:43:17.000]  And then like squeeze clamps from Harbor freight, like a big old alligator clips.
[02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:17.320]  Okay.
[02:43:17.320 --> 02:43:18.920]  Um, use those.
[02:43:18.920 --> 02:43:19.160]  Yeah.
[02:43:19.160 --> 02:43:19.480]  Yeah.
[02:43:19.480 --> 02:43:20.120]  Okay.
[02:43:20.120 --> 02:43:25.480]  Um, use those to, uh, help secure it all to the PVC frame.
[02:43:25.480 --> 02:43:31.560]  Um, and also close up the ends, uh, wrapped a plastic grill tight and clamp the, uh,
[02:43:31.560 --> 02:43:32.280]  clamps on them.
[02:43:32.280 --> 02:43:33.000]  Yeah.
[02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:33.320]  All right.
[02:43:33.320 --> 02:43:34.360]  We've got a sweet structure.
[02:43:34.360 --> 02:43:35.240]  We got some cover.
[02:43:35.240 --> 02:43:36.280]  We've got some airflow.
[02:43:37.480 --> 02:43:39.880]  Um, you can do the exact opposite.
[02:43:39.880 --> 02:43:41.480]  We've got some big ass plants to go in there.
[02:43:41.480 --> 02:43:44.840]  Hopefully you got some good I read genetics or some gauge green genetics or something to
[02:43:44.840 --> 02:43:45.400]  put in there.
[02:43:45.400 --> 02:43:46.680]  That'd be pretty sweet.
[02:43:46.680 --> 02:43:49.080]  Um, you can do the opposite with this.
[02:43:49.080 --> 02:43:53.400]  Also, you guys, if you're trying to keep your growing season going longer, you can put lights
[02:43:53.400 --> 02:43:57.800]  in this greenhouse too, uh, which sounds strange, but sometimes your plants are going to flower
[02:43:57.800 --> 02:44:00.040]  earlier than you want them to in some areas.
[02:44:00.040 --> 02:44:03.240]  If you're in a warmer place and then you can keep it going and then you may have to add
[02:44:03.240 --> 02:44:04.280]  a heater later in the season.
[02:44:04.280 --> 02:44:07.000]  But if you're trying to get two grows out of it, like we were talking about, you can
[02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:10.840]  pull off that light depth, grow, hang up a couple of lights, veg, some plants in there.
[02:44:10.840 --> 02:44:14.120]  All you have to do when the sun goes down at night, just turn on one or two lights and
[02:44:14.120 --> 02:44:17.000]  those will keep your plants awake so that they don't go into flower.
[02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:20.360]  Then when you're ready, just take the lights down and you can get that whole other.
[02:44:20.360 --> 02:44:22.120]  It can just be CFLs too.
[02:44:22.120 --> 02:44:23.800]  It doesn't have to keep them awake.
[02:44:23.800 --> 02:44:25.080]  They don't have to stay on all the time.
[02:44:25.080 --> 02:44:28.760]  You can just walk through every couple of hours with a light and it'll wake them up
[02:44:28.760 --> 02:44:29.320]  for sure.
[02:44:29.320 --> 02:44:30.120]  And just disrupt that.
[02:44:30.120 --> 02:44:31.960]  And they won't hurt out because they're out in the sun like that.
[02:44:31.960 --> 02:44:32.680]  They'll be cool.
[02:44:32.680 --> 02:44:35.000]  So that's a good way to get two full harvests out of this cheap.
[02:44:35.880 --> 02:44:38.760]  You're going to have to put a heater in there by the end of the season if you do it that
[02:44:38.760 --> 02:44:38.840]  way.
[02:44:38.840 --> 02:44:40.440]  But you'll get two full crops out of this.
[02:44:40.440 --> 02:44:43.720]  And if you're doing 18 by, or are we doing 12 by eight?
[02:44:43.720 --> 02:44:44.760]  Yeah, 12 by eight.
[02:44:44.760 --> 02:44:46.360]  You can fit quite a few plants in there.
[02:44:47.560 --> 02:44:49.080]  We don't want to get you hyped up on numbers.
[02:44:49.080 --> 02:44:51.960]  But yeah, well, it depends on your container size and your plant size.
[02:44:51.960 --> 02:44:52.200]  Right.
[02:44:52.200 --> 02:44:55.240]  But if you're eight feet wide, you can do either two or three pots.
[02:44:55.240 --> 02:44:55.800]  Yeah.
[02:44:55.800 --> 02:44:57.560]  I mean, cram them in there.
[02:44:57.560 --> 02:44:59.080]  There's no need to have a walk space.
[02:44:59.080 --> 02:45:01.640]  If you need to get in there, just pull the plants out.
[02:45:01.640 --> 02:45:03.080]  I mean, it's freaking outdoors.
[02:45:03.080 --> 02:45:06.920]  So, you know, that's like to army crawl through your rooms.
[02:45:06.920 --> 02:45:07.160]  Yeah.
[02:45:07.720 --> 02:45:08.520]  I'm big and clumsy.
[02:45:08.520 --> 02:45:12.040]  I leave a little bit of space and I'll get a dreadlock hung up on a branch or something.
[02:45:12.040 --> 02:45:15.560]  And that's 96 square foot of biomass if you do it right.
[02:45:16.200 --> 02:45:19.400]  So the topping lots of training, get the plants going.
[02:45:19.400 --> 02:45:19.960]  All right.
[02:45:19.960 --> 02:45:22.040]  96 square feet of tops.
[02:45:22.040 --> 02:45:23.960]  I feel like that's a decent start on light depth.
[02:45:24.600 --> 02:45:26.120]  I'm sure you guys will have questions.
[02:45:26.120 --> 02:45:27.320]  So that's what you got to do.
[02:45:27.320 --> 02:45:29.960]  You got to email me or Facebook or something.
[02:45:29.960 --> 02:45:30.600]  Me, Twitter me.
[02:45:31.240 --> 02:45:31.640]  I grow.
[02:45:31.640 --> 02:45:33.000]  No, it's grow from your heart at Hotmail.
[02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:33.720]  I won't say that anymore.
[02:45:33.720 --> 02:45:34.040]  I'm sorry.
[02:45:34.040 --> 02:45:34.920]  That's a bad habit.
[02:45:34.920 --> 02:45:36.600]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[02:45:37.800 --> 02:45:40.040]  It's at GFYH podcast on Twitter.
[02:45:40.040 --> 02:45:41.800]  It's grow from your heart on Facebook.
[02:45:42.680 --> 02:45:43.640]  You can Instagram me.
[02:45:43.640 --> 02:45:44.920]  You can call me if you know me.
[02:45:45.640 --> 02:45:47.560]  It's funny because I'll get like text messages.
[02:45:47.560 --> 02:45:48.120]  Just listen.
[02:45:48.120 --> 02:45:48.440]  What's up?
[02:45:48.440 --> 02:45:50.520]  And I'm like, oh, you should email me or something.
[02:45:50.520 --> 02:45:52.120]  It feels weird getting it this way.
[02:45:52.120 --> 02:45:52.360]  Yeah.
[02:45:52.360 --> 02:45:53.880]  Hit me up too.
[02:45:53.880 --> 02:45:55.640]  Jesse grows on Instagram.
[02:45:55.640 --> 02:45:55.800]  Yeah.
[02:45:56.760 --> 02:45:59.720]  I'm kind of bad about answering direct messages.
[02:46:00.520 --> 02:46:00.920]  Me too.
[02:46:00.920 --> 02:46:01.240]  I'll admit that.
[02:46:01.240 --> 02:46:02.360]  I swear I'll do it.
[02:46:02.360 --> 02:46:03.000]  One of these.
[02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:04.280]  No, I normally get to them.
[02:46:04.280 --> 02:46:05.560]  I'm just not very timely.
[02:46:05.560 --> 02:46:08.040]  So it may take me a week, but I'll get to you.
[02:46:08.040 --> 02:46:08.200]  Yeah.
[02:46:08.200 --> 02:46:11.880]  I got to sit down and answer just all of my emails and Facebook and Instagram direct
[02:46:11.880 --> 02:46:12.280]  messages.
[02:46:12.280 --> 02:46:15.160]  One of these days, just go right through it and empty out the inbox.
[02:46:15.720 --> 02:46:16.760]  Takes work though.
[02:46:16.760 --> 02:46:17.160]  Yeah.
[02:46:17.160 --> 02:46:17.320]  Yeah.
[02:46:17.320 --> 02:46:19.480]  And then you assign yourself tasks when you do it.
[02:46:19.480 --> 02:46:20.680]  Yes, I can do this for you.
[02:46:20.680 --> 02:46:22.440]  And then you're like, oh, there's more work.
[02:46:22.440 --> 02:46:24.760]  I'm already kind of, I'm already working.
[02:46:25.720 --> 02:46:30.200]  Like light dep takes a lot of dedication and commitment.
[02:46:30.200 --> 02:46:34.440]  So yes, it's like ninja status, but for the cost of the supplies, the time you're going
[02:46:34.440 --> 02:46:38.040]  to do it, you don't have to pay for any electricity and the sun is free.
[02:46:38.040 --> 02:46:42.200]  As long as you're reliable with getting out and covering and uncovering every day and
[02:46:42.200 --> 02:46:46.760]  not letting, uh, keeping the airflow in there and not letting it get stagnant in there.
[02:46:46.760 --> 02:46:47.400]  You should be cool.
[02:46:47.400 --> 02:46:53.560]  I think, um, I think when Sean comes to talk about his soil recycling, we'll talk a little
[02:46:53.560 --> 02:46:54.680]  bit about keeping bugs away.
[02:46:54.680 --> 02:46:57.560]  Unless you guys want to talk about bugs and the outdoor right now.
[02:46:59.720 --> 02:47:00.280]  Prevention.
[02:47:02.040 --> 02:47:02.680]  Spinosad.
[02:47:03.320 --> 02:47:03.960]  Let's go for it.
[02:47:03.960 --> 02:47:04.440]  Talk about, yeah.
[02:47:04.440 --> 02:47:05.560]  How are we going to keep bugs away?
[02:47:05.560 --> 02:47:05.960]  Actually.
[02:47:05.960 --> 02:47:06.200]  Okay.
[02:47:06.200 --> 02:47:10.440]  I had a friend ask me, um, about caterpillars last night.
[02:47:10.440 --> 02:47:15.480]  So, um, and there's not a lot you can do about them.
[02:47:15.480 --> 02:47:21.560]  Um, once it happens, so just, you know, manual labor, pick them out, um, cut away the rotten
[02:47:21.560 --> 02:47:21.800]  spots.
[02:47:22.360 --> 02:47:23.480]  And have them come pick them up for you.
[02:47:24.600 --> 02:47:25.560]  That's a Pueblo thing.
[02:47:26.120 --> 02:47:27.000]  That is a local joke.
[02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:27.320]  Sorry.
[02:47:28.040 --> 02:47:29.320]  I actually used to know a guy.
[02:47:29.320 --> 02:47:33.880]  He, uh, he told everyone that was his name and his first name actually was manual.
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.880]  So how do we keep the caterpillars from getting into the grow?
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:45.640]  Um, I believe I was told those little fuckers lay their eggs about three weeks before you
[02:47:45.640 --> 02:47:46.600]  actually see them.
[02:47:46.600 --> 02:47:51.320]  Um, so that's when it's still pretty early bud growth.
[02:47:51.320 --> 02:47:55.720]  Um, and you know, especially outdoors, they're still stretching a lot at that point.
[02:47:55.720 --> 02:47:58.040]  Um, there's just little popcorn notes on shit.
[02:47:58.920 --> 02:48:04.680]  Um, so, uh, Spinosad is something I had great success with last year.
[02:48:04.680 --> 02:48:07.560]  Um, I got it in a Monterey spray.
[02:48:07.560 --> 02:48:07.720]  Yeah.
[02:48:07.720 --> 02:48:08.680]  Monterey bug spray.
[02:48:11.400 --> 02:48:12.840]  No, actually we don't have that one.
[02:48:13.560 --> 02:48:14.520]  I think I bought it there.
[02:48:15.400 --> 02:48:22.840]  Well, we have the captain Jack's actually has more Spinosad in it than Monterey, I believe.
[02:48:22.840 --> 02:48:30.440]  So, um, uh, Neem oil, although, um, I mean, Neem oil works great.
[02:48:30.440 --> 02:48:31.320]  So, yeah.
[02:48:31.320 --> 02:48:32.520]  How do you feel about Spinosad?
[02:48:32.520 --> 02:48:36.520]  It's a, it's actually a bacteria found in the bottle of rum, uh, barrels.
[02:48:36.520 --> 02:48:36.680]  Yeah.
[02:48:36.680 --> 02:48:38.840]  I think it's, it's good to be used.
[02:48:38.840 --> 02:48:41.720]  It needs to be, it's something to be used strategically.
[02:48:41.720 --> 02:48:46.760]  Like Jesse was saying, it needs to be well-planned, thought out, talk to other people,
[02:48:46.760 --> 02:48:49.640]  figure out when they usually see these problems.
[02:48:49.640 --> 02:48:52.280]  That's a good way to put my thoughts on Neem oil too, strategically.
[02:48:52.280 --> 02:48:53.000]  Yeah.
[02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:54.760]  You don't just spray willy nilly.
[02:48:54.760 --> 02:48:58.680]  I mean, you want to, you want to apply for reasons at certain times, you know,
[02:48:58.680 --> 02:49:00.280]  you want to get in tune with your environment.
[02:49:01.560 --> 02:49:02.760]  That's where I feel about that.
[02:49:02.760 --> 02:49:05.480]  I mean, you, you want to utilize everything that you can.
[02:49:05.480 --> 02:49:10.920]  There's, you don't have too many options, especially here in Pueblo with our extreme
[02:49:10.920 --> 02:49:12.680]  weather and the past.
[02:49:12.680 --> 02:49:13.720]  We get a huge variety of pests here.
[02:49:13.720 --> 02:49:14.360]  It's amazing.
[02:49:14.360 --> 02:49:14.600]  Yeah.
[02:49:15.240 --> 02:49:17.080]  But yes, you're high and dry.
[02:49:17.080 --> 02:49:19.560]  I was, if I was a spider mite, I don't want to live here.
[02:49:20.520 --> 02:49:21.800]  Um, outdoors is the only one.
[02:49:21.800 --> 02:49:23.320]  Don't say those words, bro.
[02:49:24.440 --> 02:49:29.960]  Here, I mean, I've seen crops here completely wrecked by, uh, here goes organics again.
[02:49:29.960 --> 02:49:34.840]  I've seen crops here completely wrecked by spider mites and powdery mold, and I've never
[02:49:34.840 --> 02:49:36.520]  had an issue with them personally.
[02:49:37.480 --> 02:49:41.880]  I've found that, you know, occasionally you'll have some when the plants come out in the
[02:49:41.880 --> 02:49:43.800]  spring and they're very easy to deal with.
[02:49:45.400 --> 02:49:54.520]  A little neem oil, um, maybe some, uh, uh, like lemongrass based, uh, water, uh, is,
[02:49:55.160 --> 02:49:57.000]  you know, very easy to deal with.
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:58.680]  Most of the bugs just don't like water.
[02:49:58.680 --> 02:49:58.920]  Yeah.
[02:49:59.800 --> 02:50:00.680]  Moisture.
[02:50:00.680 --> 02:50:04.040]  The gardens I've seen wrecked by them are new or bottle fed.
[02:50:04.760 --> 02:50:08.040]  They're pouring fucking chelated nutrients into the earth.
[02:50:08.040 --> 02:50:13.720]  You know, I think that the, the big problem is, is it's usually in, it comes in two situations,
[02:50:13.720 --> 02:50:19.000]  either a, they don't do anything about it and then they just get the infestation.
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:22.280]  And then that's usually where they want to come in and treat with like an Eagle 20 or
[02:50:22.280 --> 02:50:23.800]  Tetra Zan or something like that.
[02:50:24.600 --> 02:50:32.440]  Um, or the other situation is, is that they'll actually use those things on a regular basis
[02:50:32.440 --> 02:50:33.800]  as a preventative.
[02:50:33.800 --> 02:50:39.400]  Uh, the plant builds no sort of self immune system, you know, you're all, you're doing
[02:50:39.400 --> 02:50:40.040]  it for it.
[02:50:40.040 --> 02:50:44.680]  The second that you forget, or the second that that insect builds up a resistance, you've
[02:50:44.680 --> 02:50:45.880]  lost the war.
[02:50:45.880 --> 02:50:48.200]  So yeah, the trick is prevention.
[02:50:48.200 --> 02:50:49.080]  You want to go at it.
[02:50:49.720 --> 02:50:49.960]  Really?
[02:50:49.960 --> 02:50:51.560]  You want to go at it systemically.
[02:50:51.560 --> 02:50:55.800]  You want to add in neem cake and crustacean meal, things like that into your soil mix.
[02:50:55.800 --> 02:51:00.760]  You want to plan out spray regiments of neem oil, uh, essential oils.
[02:51:00.760 --> 02:51:08.040]  Like he was saying, uh, lemon grass, uh, peppermint oil, uh, rosemary, rosemary kills
[02:51:08.040 --> 02:51:09.720]  spider mites on contacts.
[02:51:09.720 --> 02:51:14.120]  Um, so if you, if you see a little bit of an infestation, your first thing is to go
[02:51:14.120 --> 02:51:17.960]  and remove any stippled, you know, anything with stippling and then go back through and
[02:51:17.960 --> 02:51:19.960]  hit them with some rosemary oil.
[02:51:19.960 --> 02:51:21.160]  What's your thoughts on this?
[02:51:21.160 --> 02:51:23.560]  Um, I have rosemary growing in my yard.
[02:51:24.520 --> 02:51:30.360]  Um, how would I go about just taking the raw plant and utilizing that into, uh,
[02:51:30.920 --> 02:51:32.840]  so you can go a couple of ways.
[02:51:32.840 --> 02:51:38.920]  So there's either a, you can make it like a traditional essential oil, which is, I have
[02:51:38.920 --> 02:51:40.440]  no idea how to do that.
[02:51:40.440 --> 02:51:42.280]  That's just, that's just a quick Google search.
[02:51:42.280 --> 02:51:43.640]  It's really not that hard.
[02:51:43.640 --> 02:51:47.640]  It's just kind of like you, you know, you mix it, sit and forget it.
[02:51:47.640 --> 02:51:50.280]  You know, you might have to apply some heat to it or things like that.
[02:51:50.280 --> 02:51:55.320]  The other option would be like a cold process, kind of like a ferment to kind of extract
[02:51:55.320 --> 02:51:56.760]  those essential oils.
[02:51:56.760 --> 02:51:59.880]  So that would be more like a fermented plant juice.
[02:51:59.880 --> 02:52:03.320]  So then you would go, that would go back to like the Korean natural farming that I kind
[02:52:03.320 --> 02:52:08.600]  of do where you would take the rosemary or whatever plant you would want, mix it in.
[02:52:08.600 --> 02:52:09.160]  Basil.
[02:52:09.160 --> 02:52:09.880]  Yeah, basil.
[02:52:10.760 --> 02:52:13.160]  Honestly, you could do mixtures of them all.
[02:52:13.160 --> 02:52:21.560]  I do, uh, personally I do ginger, garlic, cinnamon sticks, and then I'll grind all of
[02:52:21.560 --> 02:52:25.400]  that up, mix it in with the indigenous microorganism and EM1.
[02:52:26.120 --> 02:52:31.000]  And yeah, that's usually how I create a little, you know, spray off of that.
[02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:31.560]  I also have a...
[02:52:31.560 --> 02:52:31.960]  Tanner Iskra
[02:52:31.960 --> 02:52:33.560]  Damn, I bet that smells amazing.
[02:52:33.560 --> 02:52:34.040]  Chris It does.
[02:52:35.240 --> 02:52:38.360]  Like my girlfriend actually likes that when I spray it in the house.
[02:52:38.360 --> 02:52:43.000]  Um, but yeah, so yeah, damn, I'm like, forget what I'm saying.
[02:52:43.400 --> 02:52:45.160]  We got to smoke different dabs next time.
[02:52:45.160 --> 02:52:45.720]  I'm sorry.
[02:52:46.280 --> 02:52:49.800]  We only took one or two dabs and everybody looked at me like, I'm high, let's podcast.
[02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:52.520]  Ah, so preventatives.
[02:52:52.520 --> 02:52:53.560]  Yeah, the stuff you mix up.
[02:52:53.560 --> 02:52:57.240]  So yeah, you just want to, uh, preventative, preventatives are key.
[02:52:57.240 --> 02:53:02.760]  So you want to plan out your neem sprays, your essential oil sprays, uh, your Spinosia,
[02:53:02.760 --> 02:53:04.440]  anything that you're going to use.
[02:53:04.440 --> 02:53:08.520]  You want to make sure that you have it planned out on a calendar when you're going to use
[02:53:08.520 --> 02:53:09.400]  it before you go.
[02:53:09.400 --> 02:53:13.400]  If you're going to make things like I was saying, you want to make sure that you give
[02:53:13.400 --> 02:53:18.040]  yourself a month or two in advance so you can make them and they'll be ready.
[02:53:18.040 --> 02:53:19.720]  Cause these are, you know, 30 day ferments.
[02:53:19.720 --> 02:53:19.960]  Tanner Iskra
[02:53:19.960 --> 02:53:20.120]  Right.
[02:53:20.120 --> 02:53:23.720]  And making worm casting teas and things has taught me to plan several days ahead.
[02:53:23.720 --> 02:53:24.280]  Chris Exactly.
[02:53:24.280 --> 02:53:28.600]  You know, you're going to, you have to start it, you know, 12 to 48 hours before you're
[02:53:28.600 --> 02:53:29.480]  actually going to apply it.
[02:53:29.480 --> 02:53:29.640]  Tanner Iskra
[02:53:29.640 --> 02:53:30.760]  Before it's even useful.
[02:53:30.760 --> 02:53:31.320]  Yep.
[02:53:31.320 --> 02:53:32.360]  Get that foamy layer.
[02:53:32.360 --> 02:53:33.960]  Chris Which when you, when you get used to it,
[02:53:33.960 --> 02:53:38.040]  it actually is, it kind of turns out to be a lot easier because you're like, well, I'm
[02:53:38.040 --> 02:53:39.160]  on your way out of the garden.
[02:53:39.160 --> 02:53:41.960]  You start this tea up and you'll hit it the next day with it.
[02:53:41.960 --> 02:53:44.280]  So it works out like that.
[02:53:44.280 --> 02:53:44.920]  Tanner Iskra
[02:53:44.920 --> 02:53:46.200]  I'm getting away from the bottles.
[02:53:46.200 --> 02:53:47.000]  Thank you.
[02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:48.120]  You guys are doing it for me.
[02:53:48.120 --> 02:53:51.480]  So we got some hoop house action, kind of got some ideas on how to keep away the bugs.
[02:53:52.120 --> 02:53:53.640]  What was the one thing you talk about a lot?
[02:53:53.640 --> 02:53:54.520]  Karanja meal?
[02:53:54.520 --> 02:53:57.800]  Chris So yeah, so there's neem and then there's
[02:53:57.800 --> 02:53:58.440]  Karanja.
[02:53:59.240 --> 02:54:00.520]  They're the same thing.
[02:54:00.520 --> 02:54:05.400]  You hear a lot of people talk about like a neem and Karanja 50 50 mix.
[02:54:05.400 --> 02:54:07.080]  It's really unnecessary.
[02:54:07.080 --> 02:54:14.680]  The big difference is that like neem oil technically has like, what's the word I'm
[02:54:14.680 --> 02:54:15.320]  looking for?
[02:54:16.440 --> 02:54:23.560]  Almost like birth control style properties to it, which for human health reasons and
[02:54:23.560 --> 02:54:24.840]  Karanja oil doesn't.
[02:54:24.840 --> 02:54:25.400]  Tanner Iskra
[02:54:25.400 --> 02:54:30.920]  So that's kind of my basic understanding is that they're the same thing.
[02:54:30.920 --> 02:54:35.640]  Basically Karanja oil is a hell of a lot cheaper to source or at least Karanja meal.
[02:54:36.600 --> 02:54:42.200]  I can't, I've never personally used Karanja oil specifically, but the, it's basically
[02:54:42.200 --> 02:54:43.080]  the same thing as neem.
[02:54:43.080 --> 02:54:43.560]  Chris Okay.
[02:54:43.560 --> 02:54:45.800]  You got me curious about these birth control properties now.
[02:54:45.800 --> 02:54:46.840]  Tanner Iskra
[02:54:46.840 --> 02:54:47.160]  Yeah.
[02:54:47.160 --> 02:54:48.280]  Chris I won't ask.
[02:54:48.280 --> 02:54:49.720]  Tanner Iskra
[02:54:49.720 --> 02:54:52.680]  Oh, if you really want some birth control properties, go use Eagle 20.
[02:54:52.680 --> 02:54:53.480]  I'll make you spiritual.
[02:54:53.480 --> 02:54:53.960]  Chris Oh yeah.
[02:54:55.320 --> 02:54:56.200]  It'll make you twitch.
[02:54:56.920 --> 02:54:59.640]  You won't get laid at all because your eyes are twitching.
[02:54:59.640 --> 02:55:01.800]  Yeah, definitely birth control right there.
[02:55:02.360 --> 02:55:02.600]  All right.
[02:55:02.600 --> 02:55:05.560]  I want to see if I got over all the stuff we wrote down because we're coming up on
[02:55:05.880 --> 02:55:06.120]  minutes.
[02:55:06.120 --> 02:55:07.560]  I'm trying to keep this about an hour.
[02:55:07.560 --> 02:55:11.320]  I've noticed we get a lot more lessons when we go like 50 instead of 70.
[02:55:13.320 --> 02:55:14.600]  We ran out of our attention.
[02:55:14.600 --> 02:55:15.560]  What are we going to say?
[02:55:16.280 --> 02:55:18.600]  Part of my problem is I'm over here making notes and reading shit.
[02:55:18.600 --> 02:55:19.480]  You guys are just high.
[02:55:21.400 --> 02:55:21.720]  Let's see.
[02:55:21.720 --> 02:55:22.280]  We got over that.
[02:55:22.280 --> 02:55:24.840]  We got over all the stuff that I wrote down on this page.
[02:55:24.840 --> 02:55:27.240]  I promise you guys I'll get you a coupon code at the end of the episode.
[02:55:27.240 --> 02:55:28.600]  I'll throw that in right at the end.
[02:55:29.960 --> 02:55:33.400]  Man, one of the cool words I learned today, nutritive cycle theory.
[02:55:33.400 --> 02:55:34.360]  I like that.
[02:55:34.360 --> 02:55:34.760]  It's good.
[02:55:35.480 --> 02:55:37.560]  I'm going to have to do that again and read more about that.
[02:55:37.560 --> 02:55:38.360]  I said, do that again.
[02:55:38.360 --> 02:55:38.920]  What am I going to do with that?
[02:55:38.920 --> 02:55:39.720]  The good old NCT.
[02:55:40.360 --> 02:55:41.240]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:55:41.240 --> 02:55:42.200]  No, I just made that up.
[02:55:43.640 --> 02:55:44.600]  That's new to me too.
[02:55:45.320 --> 02:55:50.440]  I've got a couple of posts up about it on my feed and then Rocky Mountain Natural Farming's
[02:55:50.440 --> 02:55:51.000]  page.
[02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.080]  I've got a little post about it up.
[02:55:53.080 --> 02:55:57.080]  Guys, make sure you check out the Rocky Mountain Natural Farming and the Rocky Mountain Worm
[02:55:57.080 --> 02:55:57.400]  Company.
[02:55:57.400 --> 02:55:58.280]  Check those guys out.
[02:55:58.280 --> 02:55:59.160]  All their internet stuff.
[02:55:59.160 --> 02:56:00.600]  You will learn so much.
[02:56:00.600 --> 02:56:05.640]  Put on the podcast, put in some headphones and go type in Rocky Mountain Worm Company
[02:56:05.640 --> 02:56:10.040]  and just click on links and see where you end up and see what you learn.
[02:56:10.040 --> 02:56:11.720]  Anything you read on there is useful.
[02:56:11.720 --> 02:56:12.680]  So just read it all.
[02:56:12.680 --> 02:56:15.400]  And then when you have a question, just comment and ask.
[02:56:15.400 --> 02:56:15.640]  Yes.
[02:56:16.360 --> 02:56:17.560]  And I'll bring Sean back.
[02:56:17.560 --> 02:56:20.600]  I'll be like, this guy asked this question and Sean will come and he'll say, this is
[02:56:20.600 --> 02:56:22.280]  the answer, young Jedi.
[02:56:22.280 --> 02:56:24.920]  We'll all learn to grow like a pro here organically.
[02:56:24.920 --> 02:56:29.240]  And every bit of this applies to your gardens too.
[02:56:30.280 --> 02:56:33.800]  Corn, tomatoes, all that good stuff too.
[02:56:33.800 --> 02:56:34.440]  Yeah.
[02:56:34.440 --> 02:56:34.680]  Yeah.
[02:56:35.800 --> 02:56:37.400]  We use worm castings on all of it.
[02:56:37.400 --> 02:56:37.560]  Yeah.
[02:56:37.560 --> 02:56:38.840]  This is not just pot.
[02:56:38.840 --> 02:56:39.000]  Yeah.
[02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:39.720]  I'm glad that...
[02:56:39.720 --> 02:56:41.880]  And you don't have to buy everything at the Hydro store either.
[02:56:41.880 --> 02:56:43.000]  There's their other store.
[02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:46.600]  And I hate to say that since the Hydro shop is a sponsor, but you can go to the farming
[02:56:46.600 --> 02:56:48.440]  store and the regular grow store.
[02:56:48.440 --> 02:56:52.920]  There's a nursery around here that sells grow supplies, but they don't have any grow lights
[02:56:52.920 --> 02:56:53.240]  or anything.
[02:56:53.240 --> 02:56:55.160]  But they've got lots of great amendments and things.
[02:56:55.160 --> 02:56:56.680]  It's a garden supply store.
[02:56:56.680 --> 02:56:58.120]  You can go to those places too, you guys.
[02:56:58.120 --> 02:56:58.760]  Don't be afraid.
[02:56:59.320 --> 02:57:01.720]  Agriculture, horticulture stores, supply stores.
[02:57:01.720 --> 02:57:03.080]  And support your local economy.
[02:57:03.080 --> 02:57:03.480]  Yeah.
[02:57:03.480 --> 02:57:04.520]  They know why you're there.
[02:57:04.520 --> 02:57:05.800]  Don't rub it in their face.
[02:57:05.800 --> 02:57:06.280]  Yeah.
[02:57:06.280 --> 02:57:08.680]  That's just a garden store, man.
[02:57:08.680 --> 02:57:08.840]  Yeah.
[02:57:09.560 --> 02:57:12.760]  Well, if you're on that level buying that stuff, you know the etiquette by now anyway.
[02:57:12.760 --> 02:57:13.400]  For sure.
[02:57:13.400 --> 02:57:13.720]  I hope.
[02:57:13.720 --> 02:57:16.600]  If you're listening to us, we don't have to remind you to not walk into the garden store
[02:57:16.600 --> 02:57:19.880]  and be like, my weed plants need more nitrogen, bro.
[02:57:19.880 --> 02:57:21.240]  No, go in there and just be discreet.
[02:57:21.320 --> 02:57:24.280]  At our local one, I've seen more than one person get kicked out of there.
[02:57:24.280 --> 02:57:24.600]  Oh yeah.
[02:57:24.600 --> 02:57:25.960]  They'll completely make you leave.
[02:57:25.960 --> 02:57:30.040]  I'm like, man, I'm here for the exact same thing, but I'm not a dick.
[02:57:30.600 --> 02:57:30.840]  Yep.
[02:57:31.400 --> 02:57:31.640]  Yeah.
[02:57:31.640 --> 02:57:32.200]  And they know.
[02:57:32.200 --> 02:57:33.880]  We smoked a joint in the car on the way.
[02:57:33.880 --> 02:57:33.960]  Yeah.
[02:57:33.960 --> 02:57:35.400]  So we smelled lovely.
[02:57:35.400 --> 02:57:36.680]  And they're like, oh, what's up, man?
[02:57:37.800 --> 02:57:39.240]  Before I forget, I wrote down this.
[02:57:39.240 --> 02:57:40.200]  Big shout out to Lins.
[02:57:40.200 --> 02:57:41.160]  Big shout out to Judy.
[02:57:41.160 --> 02:57:42.600]  Big shout out to Dreadful J.
[02:57:42.600 --> 02:57:45.400]  And also everyone to, or shout out to everyone from Bonk TV.
[02:57:45.400 --> 02:57:46.920]  You guys have been listening to the show.
[02:57:46.920 --> 02:57:47.880]  I appreciate that.
[02:57:48.840 --> 02:57:52.120]  That's something important that I wrote down because I'm high and forgetful today.
[02:57:53.400 --> 02:57:54.280]  We're going to wrap it up.
[02:57:54.280 --> 02:57:59.720]  Do you guys have any final magnificent words of wisdom towards the end of the show here?
[02:58:00.760 --> 02:58:03.400]  Grow meeting March 6th at Hygro.
[02:58:03.400 --> 02:58:04.440]  March 6th.
[02:58:04.440 --> 02:58:07.000]  I'm going to write that down because I'm forgetful today.
[02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:07.960]  And I lost my pen.
[02:58:07.960 --> 02:58:09.240]  How did, what's going on?
[02:58:09.240 --> 02:58:12.200]  I'll be sure to be there for that one.
[02:58:12.200 --> 02:58:12.760]  For sure.
[02:58:12.760 --> 02:58:13.480]  Yeah.
[02:58:13.480 --> 02:58:15.000]  Let us, I don't have a topic.
[02:58:15.160 --> 02:58:21.000]  Um, I did have a topic, but, um, I don't know how, yeah.
[02:58:21.880 --> 02:58:22.520]  Give me a new one.
[02:58:23.960 --> 02:58:25.080]  Throw us an ideal.
[02:58:25.080 --> 02:58:25.880]  So, yeah.
[02:58:25.880 --> 02:58:26.600]  All right.
[02:58:26.600 --> 02:58:27.100]  Yeah.
[02:58:27.800 --> 02:58:31.880]  So new grow, uh, the next grow meeting and Hygro indoor growing supplies in Pueblo,
[02:58:31.880 --> 02:58:33.960]  March 6th, 2015.
[02:58:33.960 --> 02:58:34.760]  I will be there.
[02:58:34.760 --> 02:58:36.040]  I'm pretty sure I'll be there.
[02:58:36.040 --> 02:58:39.640]  I don't see any reason why I wouldn't be unless fish comes to town or something.
[02:58:40.520 --> 02:58:41.800]  Jesse will be there.
[02:58:41.800 --> 02:58:42.520]  Sean will be there.
[02:58:43.160 --> 02:58:44.440]  We'll get a lot of cool people there.
[02:58:44.440 --> 02:58:45.000]  Come meet us.
[02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:46.520]  You guys, Armando V Hill.
[02:58:46.520 --> 02:58:48.280]  This is your personal invitation.
[02:58:48.280 --> 02:58:51.160]  We wanted to hang out and meet you for a while.
[02:58:51.160 --> 02:58:52.120]  Come down, bro.
[02:58:52.120 --> 02:58:55.960]  All the people that have been trying to hang out with us, uh, us growers can't leave.
[02:58:55.960 --> 02:59:00.120]  We're kind of nerds and, uh, hermits and we stay at home and grow weed all day.
[02:59:00.120 --> 02:59:03.800]  And then, uh, we do, we got to do at work and then we go home and grow more weed.
[02:59:03.800 --> 02:59:07.640]  But, uh, so come hang out with us at these grower meetings because we've just committed
[02:59:07.640 --> 02:59:08.120]  to be in there.
[02:59:08.120 --> 02:59:09.320]  We'll all be there all at once.
[02:59:09.320 --> 02:59:10.440]  We're going to teach you a bunch of stuff.
[02:59:10.440 --> 02:59:11.560]  We're going to learn a bunch of stuff.
[02:59:11.560 --> 02:59:12.200]  It'll be fun.
[02:59:12.200 --> 02:59:13.960]  And just added it into the calendar, man.
[02:59:14.440 --> 02:59:15.560]  Oh, it's official now.
[02:59:16.760 --> 02:59:19.480]  Jesse will put it on Facebook and that'll make it super official.
[02:59:19.480 --> 02:59:20.440]  Facebook official.
[02:59:21.720 --> 02:59:22.920]  February 27th.
[02:59:22.920 --> 02:59:24.440]  We're going to do another free tea day.
[02:59:25.320 --> 02:59:25.640]  Cool.
[02:59:25.640 --> 02:59:27.880]  We had a great response from that.
[02:59:27.880 --> 02:59:30.120]  So, and request to do it again.
[02:59:30.120 --> 02:59:31.800]  So it was like, hell, all right.
[02:59:31.800 --> 02:59:33.080]  I saw the TB and brood.
[02:59:33.080 --> 02:59:34.280]  It looked perfect.
[02:59:34.280 --> 02:59:35.240]  It was marvelous.
[02:59:35.240 --> 02:59:36.440]  Did you mix that yourself?
[02:59:36.440 --> 02:59:36.760]  Yeah.
[02:59:36.760 --> 02:59:37.320]  Good job, bro.
[02:59:37.960 --> 02:59:41.160]  Rocky mountain earthworm castings and molasses.
[02:59:41.160 --> 02:59:41.880]  That's all you need.
[02:59:41.880 --> 02:59:43.720]  Oh, I put a little alfalfa in it.
[02:59:44.760 --> 02:59:45.880]  Minuscule amount.
[02:59:45.880 --> 02:59:47.640]  So make it bubbly.
[02:59:48.920 --> 02:59:50.040]  Show me what you're warming with.
[02:59:50.040 --> 02:59:50.520]  Yeah.
[02:59:50.520 --> 02:59:51.800]  That shit was, yeah.
[02:59:53.160 --> 02:59:55.640]  Oh, this is going to get out of hand if we do the worm puns again.
[02:59:56.200 --> 02:59:56.440]  All right.
[02:59:56.440 --> 02:59:57.640]  You got any shout outs, dude?
[02:59:57.640 --> 03:00:01.240]  Uh, I mean, as always shout out to Rocky mountain worm company.
[03:00:01.240 --> 03:00:06.200]  Uh, you know, everybody who's helping us out over there, Allen, the big toker, Nick,
[03:00:06.200 --> 03:00:09.320]  you know, coming on last time and obviously you for having us.
[03:00:10.520 --> 03:00:12.840]  Thanks for coming on and giving me great content.
[03:00:12.840 --> 03:00:17.560]  You two are probably you guys and Clint are my most listened to guests.
[03:00:17.560 --> 03:00:19.960]  So this one's probably going to blow up since you're both here.
[03:00:19.960 --> 03:00:21.480]  It's like superhero status.
[03:00:21.480 --> 03:00:22.200]  What's up, Clint?
[03:00:22.200 --> 03:00:23.960]  Come do a show with us sometime.
[03:00:23.960 --> 03:00:24.460]  Yeah.
[03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:28.760]  Clint keeps us, he's like training wheels because he's, he doesn't know anything about
[03:00:28.760 --> 03:00:29.160]  cannibal.
[03:00:29.160 --> 03:00:30.440]  Not like I'm not even being a dick.
[03:00:30.440 --> 03:00:32.200]  He does not know shit about weed.
[03:00:32.200 --> 03:00:33.560]  He's like weed ignorant.
[03:00:33.560 --> 03:00:37.320]  So we'll be saying stuff and he'll look over at me like, what does all that mean?
[03:00:37.320 --> 03:00:38.680]  And then I got, oh yeah, you're right.
[03:00:38.680 --> 03:00:40.520]  We should tell everybody what that means.
[03:00:40.520 --> 03:00:43.560]  Cause we just talked like pros and they're still learning with training wheels.
[03:00:43.560 --> 03:00:49.160]  Let's have them come ask us questions about organics beginner, you know, from a dude who
[03:00:49.160 --> 03:00:53.960]  doesn't even, you know, come quiz us, come ask us the stuff that we've talked to quickly
[03:00:53.960 --> 03:00:55.000]  over and lost people.
[03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:56.840]  Come remind us to slow down.
[03:00:56.840 --> 03:00:58.280]  We'll give you six questions.
[03:00:59.160 --> 03:01:00.920]  And then after that, we'll give you six dabs.
[03:01:02.440 --> 03:01:05.320]  He's never taken a dab before, so I don't want to know.
[03:01:05.320 --> 03:01:07.080]  I'm not ready to give a dude six dabs.
[03:01:07.960 --> 03:01:10.280]  Uh, my friend D said that he's coming to Colorado.
[03:01:10.280 --> 03:01:11.400]  He doesn't live in Colorado.
[03:01:11.400 --> 03:01:14.680]  And a friend told him that his first stab he's going to take is a gram dab.
[03:01:14.680 --> 03:01:19.080]  And I've been trying strongly to discourage that from happening, but he's insisting on
[03:01:19.080 --> 03:01:21.400]  taking a gram dab for his first try.
[03:01:21.400 --> 03:01:22.600]  Dude, don't do that.
[03:01:22.600 --> 03:01:23.960]  D's listen to my friends here.
[03:01:23.960 --> 03:01:25.960]  They don't know you and they advise against it.
[03:01:25.960 --> 03:01:27.320]  You're just going to hurt yourself.
[03:01:27.320 --> 03:01:28.040]  Yeah.
[03:01:28.040 --> 03:01:29.480]  I told him he's going to fuck up his whole day.
[03:01:29.480 --> 03:01:29.640]  Yeah.
[03:01:29.640 --> 03:01:30.920]  And then everybody's going to laugh at you.
[03:01:30.920 --> 03:01:34.520]  You're looking at, well, you're going to have to eat and then go lay down and then wake
[03:01:34.520 --> 03:01:36.920]  up like 10 hours later and eat again.
[03:01:36.920 --> 03:01:38.600]  And you're going to cough for 30 minutes.
[03:01:38.600 --> 03:01:39.720]  You're going to look like an asshole.
[03:01:39.720 --> 03:01:40.200]  Don't do it.
[03:01:40.200 --> 03:01:43.960]  These are like shit for probably 30 hours.
[03:01:43.960 --> 03:01:44.280]  Yeah.
[03:01:44.280 --> 03:01:48.120]  See, and that's coming from three people that really smoke a lot of dads.
[03:01:48.120 --> 03:01:48.520]  Yeah.
[03:01:48.520 --> 03:01:51.960]  I've I do gram dabs and a gram dab is a big ass dad for me.
[03:01:51.960 --> 03:01:52.920]  That's my limit.
[03:01:52.920 --> 03:01:54.680]  Half gram is a little more than I want.
[03:01:54.680 --> 03:01:56.280]  Point three is comfortable.
[03:01:56.280 --> 03:01:58.120]  Like that's, and that's a big dad.
[03:01:58.120 --> 03:01:59.880]  Most people do about 0.1.
[03:01:59.880 --> 03:02:01.080]  It's just dick waving.
[03:02:01.080 --> 03:02:01.560]  I'm sorry.
[03:02:02.200 --> 03:02:02.520]  Yeah.
[03:02:02.520 --> 03:02:04.040]  There, there's no need to do that.
[03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:05.560]  Yeah.
[03:02:05.560 --> 03:02:11.080]  I mean, Jeff has his reasons and, and he's very aware that it's just dick waving and
[03:02:11.080 --> 03:02:12.440]  I like to take dabs.
[03:02:12.440 --> 03:02:14.040]  I just like waving his dicks.
[03:02:14.040 --> 03:02:17.640]  I like it when, when that dad, when you're not sure if you're going to come have a stroke,
[03:02:17.640 --> 03:02:21.480]  a little bit of a heart attack, or if you want to jump up and high five, all your friends
[03:02:21.480 --> 03:02:23.000]  all at the same time from a dab.
[03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:24.200]  I love that feeling.
[03:02:24.200 --> 03:02:26.520]  That's, and that's what a 0.5 does to you.
[03:02:26.520 --> 03:02:27.080]  Cheerleader.
[03:02:27.080 --> 03:02:29.160]  Dev cheerleader, dads, cheerleader, dads, guys.
[03:02:29.160 --> 03:02:31.240]  When you take a big dab in your arms, just start moving.
[03:02:31.800 --> 03:02:34.120]  Give me an a, give me a B and you're not even trying.
[03:02:35.480 --> 03:02:37.160]  It's similar to the Josh blue.
[03:02:37.160 --> 03:02:39.160]  That was a straight from Facebook.
[03:02:39.160 --> 03:02:40.920]  That, oh no, he'd laugh his ass off.
[03:02:40.920 --> 03:02:41.000]  Yeah.
[03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:41.480]  That's true.
[03:02:41.480 --> 03:02:42.280]  Shout out to Josh blue.
[03:02:42.280 --> 03:02:43.400]  I've seen Josh a few times.
[03:02:43.400 --> 03:02:44.280]  He's hilarious.
[03:02:44.280 --> 03:02:44.760]  Yeah.
[03:02:44.760 --> 03:02:45.560]  Hilarious guys.
[03:02:45.560 --> 03:02:46.520]  I hope you paid attention to all.
[03:02:46.520 --> 03:02:48.040]  I hope you learned a whole bunch of stuff today.
[03:02:48.040 --> 03:02:50.520]  I hope you learned how to build your own outdoor hoop house.
[03:02:50.520 --> 03:02:52.360]  I hope you're going to build a hoop house in your backyard.
[03:02:52.360 --> 03:02:54.520]  I hope you're going to grow a whole bunch of cannabis.
[03:02:54.520 --> 03:02:57.720]  I hope you, your neighbors, their neighbors, their neighbors, and all your other neighbors
[03:02:57.720 --> 03:03:01.720]  are going to be like, damn, whose weed smells so good because everybody is growing a big
[03:03:01.720 --> 03:03:03.240]  plot of outdoor cannabis this summer.
[03:03:03.240 --> 03:03:04.120]  That's what I want.
[03:03:04.120 --> 03:03:05.320]  Happens on a County road.
[03:03:05.320 --> 03:03:07.640]  I hang around on overgrow the government.
[03:03:07.640 --> 03:03:08.520]  They can't bust us all.
[03:03:08.520 --> 03:03:12.360]  They can't take down every crop grow, grow, grow, grow, grow, grow some more.
[03:03:12.360 --> 03:03:14.760]  Teach a friend how to grow while you're teaching your friends, how to grow.
[03:03:14.760 --> 03:03:18.280]  Teach one of your friends, teach, teach to your friends about the grow from your heart
[03:03:18.280 --> 03:03:18.680]  podcast.
[03:03:18.680 --> 03:03:21.080]  Cause if you teach one person, they'll get high and forget.
[03:03:21.080 --> 03:03:24.840]  If you tell two people, the chances are one of those people might come and listen to the
[03:03:24.840 --> 03:03:25.160]  show.
[03:03:25.160 --> 03:03:27.960]  So teach more people about the show while we're teaching everyone to grow weed.
[03:03:28.760 --> 03:03:29.880]  I think we're making mom.
[03:03:29.880 --> 03:03:31.160]  Listen, make your mom.
[03:03:31.160 --> 03:03:32.840]  Listen, that's funny.
[03:03:32.840 --> 03:03:35.000]  Grab your mom, make her listen to the podcast.
[03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:37.560]  She might be, she might think that weeds a devil and she'll listen to us.
[03:03:37.560 --> 03:03:40.520]  The only problems we had today was we all forgot what the hell we're talking about.
[03:03:41.240 --> 03:03:42.440]  Jesse needed extra water.
[03:03:44.040 --> 03:03:47.320]  I could already have ADHD, but I could barely sit.
[03:03:47.320 --> 03:03:51.240]  I'm having a very hard time sitting still right now.
[03:03:51.240 --> 03:03:52.760]  That's why you're like the construction guy.
[03:03:52.760 --> 03:03:54.280]  That's why you build shit all day.
[03:03:54.280 --> 03:03:54.840]  I gotta go.
[03:03:54.840 --> 03:03:55.640]  I gotta do stuff.
[03:03:55.640 --> 03:03:56.600]  I gotta build things.
[03:03:57.480 --> 03:03:58.120]  That's why I smoke.
[03:03:58.120 --> 03:03:59.080]  Chemical dude.
[03:03:59.080 --> 03:03:59.320]  All right.
[03:04:01.320 --> 03:04:02.120]  No, it's all cool.
[03:04:02.600 --> 03:04:04.040]  I made these lemon Jeffrey dad.
[03:04:04.040 --> 03:04:09.160]  Someone had some sour diesel the other day and it was very good.
[03:04:09.160 --> 03:04:10.520]  A cousin Tater there.
[03:04:10.520 --> 03:04:11.480]  Shout out cousin Tater.
[03:04:11.480 --> 03:04:12.600]  Good cousin Tater.
[03:04:12.600 --> 03:04:13.240]  He's killing it.
[03:04:13.240 --> 03:04:15.720]  He's got a bunch of my genetics and he's been killing it with my stuff.
[03:04:15.720 --> 03:04:16.920]  He does well with my seeds.
[03:04:17.640 --> 03:04:20.600]  I'd give him a best new grower of the year that I know.
[03:04:22.360 --> 03:04:22.920]  There you go.
[03:04:22.920 --> 03:04:25.160]  And then Adam, let's get Adam that award this year.
[03:04:25.160 --> 03:04:27.320]  Let's make Adam the best new grower of the year.
[03:04:27.320 --> 03:04:28.200]  Most dedication.
[03:04:28.200 --> 03:04:29.080]  He's got to, yeah.
[03:04:29.080 --> 03:04:29.800]  You got to earn it, bro.
[03:04:29.800 --> 03:04:31.880]  We're not giving it to you yet, but that's what we want from you.
[03:04:32.200 --> 03:04:33.880]  We want you to be the best new grower that we know.
[03:04:34.520 --> 03:04:36.680]  You're part of the grow crew now, like it or not.
[03:04:36.680 --> 03:04:38.520]  He does what he's told to do.
[03:04:38.520 --> 03:04:39.960]  He puts the lotion on the skin.
[03:04:42.360 --> 03:04:43.640]  No more whip for Adam again.
[03:04:44.360 --> 03:04:47.480]  I'm going to close the show with all that nonsense.
[03:04:47.480 --> 03:04:48.360]  You guys, thanks for listening.
[03:04:48.360 --> 03:04:49.800]  You guys, thanks for coming, dude.
[03:04:49.800 --> 03:04:53.400]  I called Sean at like, I was like, can you be here like a half hour for a podcast?
[03:04:53.400 --> 03:04:54.920]  And he's like, sure, no problem.
[03:04:54.920 --> 03:04:55.880]  So that was kind of cool.
[03:04:55.880 --> 03:04:56.840]  Jesse, thanks for coming, dude.
[03:04:56.840 --> 03:04:58.040]  I know you're a super busy guy.
[03:04:58.040 --> 03:05:01.240]  I appreciate you guys being here, teaching the world how to grow great cannabis,
[03:05:01.240 --> 03:05:02.440]  organic and sustainably.
[03:05:03.240 --> 03:05:03.880]  Guys, thank you for...
[03:05:03.880 --> 03:05:04.920]  Treating our mother right.
[03:05:04.920 --> 03:05:05.800]  That's right.
[03:05:05.800 --> 03:05:06.920]  And I treat your mother right too.
[03:05:10.440 --> 03:05:11.960]  Thanks for listening to the podcast, everybody.
[03:05:13.320 --> 03:05:15.000]  I promise the episodes are getting better and better.
[03:05:15.000 --> 03:05:16.280]  I've got more cool guests.
[03:05:16.280 --> 03:05:18.040]  People are reaching out to me to be on the show.
[03:05:18.680 --> 03:05:21.400]  I hear the guys from CannaVenture and Sour Seeds want to be on the show.
[03:05:21.960 --> 03:05:24.600]  The Dragonfly Earth Medicine people want to be on the show.
[03:05:24.600 --> 03:05:27.960]  We're going to get Alan from the Worm Company on here, like it or not.
[03:05:27.960 --> 03:05:30.600]  We'll duct tape him and drag him in here and make him talk.
[03:05:30.600 --> 03:05:33.480]  I'm sure if I say, tell me about worms, he'll just start going.
[03:05:33.480 --> 03:05:35.080]  And that's all I need to do is just get him here.
[03:05:36.280 --> 03:05:36.920]  Keep listening, guys.
[03:05:36.920 --> 03:05:37.480]  They're getting better.
[03:05:37.480 --> 03:05:40.920]  I appreciate you for sticking through the weird winter episodes when things got chaotic.
[03:05:41.560 --> 03:05:42.440]  Now the show's over.
[03:05:42.440 --> 03:05:43.880]  Please go to iTunes or Stitcher.
[03:05:43.880 --> 03:05:46.360]  Go to the iTunes store or Stitcher's weird.
[03:05:46.360 --> 03:05:49.000]  It's hard to find where to make comments, but just figure that out.
[03:05:49.000 --> 03:05:49.960]  Search for Grow From Your Heart.
[03:05:49.960 --> 03:05:50.760]  Find the review section.
[03:05:50.760 --> 03:05:51.800]  Give me a five-star rating.
[03:05:51.800 --> 03:05:52.760]  After that, type in a comment.
[03:05:52.760 --> 03:05:56.440]  Let me know what you think of the show and I will read your comments on the show.
[03:05:56.440 --> 03:05:58.760]  Stitcher keeps changing the way everything's done on there.
[03:05:58.760 --> 03:05:59.960]  I don't know why they keep doing that.
[03:05:59.960 --> 03:06:01.320]  It's hard to find a spot for comments.
[03:06:01.320 --> 03:06:03.320]  Sometimes it's hard for me to read the comments.
[03:06:03.320 --> 03:06:05.080]  If I can find them, I'll read them for you.
[03:06:05.080 --> 03:06:06.600]  Don't feel bad if I skip you on Stitcher.
[03:06:06.600 --> 03:06:08.040]  It's just that place is a pain in the ass.
[03:06:08.040 --> 03:06:09.640]  It's free, so I can't complain.
[03:06:09.640 --> 03:06:11.560]  That's where I listen to it at most of the time.
[03:06:11.560 --> 03:06:13.000]  We get a lot of good ratings on Stitcher.
[03:06:13.000 --> 03:06:16.040]  We were ranked, there are, you know, I kept saying 25,000.
[03:06:16.040 --> 03:06:21.240]  There are only 15,000 shows on Stitcher, but we were ranked 888 for a couple of episodes.
[03:06:21.240 --> 03:06:22.840]  Around 50 in that time period.
[03:06:22.840 --> 03:06:23.640]  We're really kicking it.
[03:06:23.640 --> 03:06:28.760]  I haven't looked lately because I don't want to get too excited or disappointed, but 888.
[03:06:28.760 --> 03:06:32.200]  That's more than another podcast that's on there.
[03:06:32.200 --> 03:06:36.680]  That's more than, yeah, we, for that week, we may have been the leading cannabis podcast.
[03:06:36.680 --> 03:06:37.080]  I bet.
[03:06:37.080 --> 03:06:38.120]  For that week.
[03:06:38.120 --> 03:06:39.480]  And I'm not even dissing anybody.
[03:06:39.480 --> 03:06:40.920]  I'm just saying, holy shit, we've done that.
[03:06:40.920 --> 03:06:41.800]  Thank you guys for listening.
[03:06:41.800 --> 03:06:43.080]  You made that happen.
