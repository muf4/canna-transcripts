[00:00.000 --> 00:11.980]  Welcome to the show podcast world.
[00:11.980 --> 00:15.380]  It's time for episode 353 of the grow from your heart podcast,
[00:15.460 --> 00:18.540]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:19.340 --> 00:21.700]  That's right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:21.740 --> 00:23.780]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:24.060 --> 00:27.100]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the
[00:27.100 --> 00:30.900]  current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:31.460 --> 00:33.460]  I'm your host. My friends call me Ross DeJeff.
[00:33.500 --> 00:35.060]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:35.660 --> 00:38.660]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at the hella dank seed
[00:38.660 --> 00:42.340]  company. If you need new regular or feminized seeds for your garden,
[00:42.380 --> 00:46.180]  I highly recommend the hella dank seed company and you can find them at
[00:46.180 --> 00:50.420]  dankseed.store. Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat spliff,
[00:50.620 --> 00:53.180]  pack up a fresh bowl, put some fresh water in the bomb,
[00:53.340 --> 00:57.140]  or start heating up that dab nail because it's time for a fresh episode of the
[00:57.140 --> 00:58.700]  grow from your heart podcast.
[01:02.630 --> 01:06.270]  Welcome to the show. Everybody it's time for episode three 53, you know,
[01:06.270 --> 01:09.590]  I like to start the show off by letting you know what I'm smoking today.
[01:09.590 --> 01:13.830]  I'm taking dabs of blueberry Citron Fambrosia from apothecary farms in
[01:13.830 --> 01:14.950]  Colorado Springs.
[01:15.110 --> 01:19.910]  This is labeled as 74.8% THC and total cannabinoids
[01:19.910 --> 01:21.950]  are 87.3%.
[01:22.190 --> 01:25.950]  The remarkable part about this concentrate is the aroma and the flavor.
[01:26.190 --> 01:30.350]  It smells like clementines. It smells like sweet candied oranges rolled in sugar.
[01:30.630 --> 01:34.630]  Then it also has a hint of purple Laffy Taffy's in the background.
[01:34.630 --> 01:37.470]  This stuff smells delicious. It tastes incredible.
[01:37.670 --> 01:41.390]  The high goes right to my head. It makes me ridiculously ramble.
[01:41.390 --> 01:44.550]  It was hard to sit still long enough to record a podcast, but I'm going to do it.
[01:45.030 --> 01:48.350]  Also the size of the diamonds. I bought a four gram jar.
[01:48.350 --> 01:51.910]  That's why it is labeled Fambrosia. It's a four gram jar of concentrates.
[01:52.470 --> 01:56.630]  The chunky diamonds in here are ridiculous. I, uh, I hate to admit it,
[01:56.630 --> 01:59.750]  but I've had to break a couple of them apart to dab them because they are just
[01:59.950 --> 02:01.510]  too big for one dab.
[02:01.510 --> 02:04.430]  It would be kind of a waste and it would be the end of the day.
[02:04.990 --> 02:09.390]  So I'm dabbing the blueberry citron Fambrosia from apothecary farms in Colorado
[02:09.390 --> 02:13.590]  Springs and it tastes delicious and I do approve. All right,
[02:13.590 --> 02:16.430]  where do we want to go next? Let's talk about Stitcher.
[02:17.270 --> 02:20.190]  Stitcher is a service where a lot of people were attempting to listen to the
[02:20.190 --> 02:22.510]  podcast, but it was kind of giving us trouble.
[02:22.510 --> 02:24.430]  People who listen on Android devices,
[02:24.430 --> 02:27.830]  weren't able to listen on the Stitcher application while on the go.
[02:28.750 --> 02:30.710]  I'm going to say it again with confidence.
[02:30.790 --> 02:33.470]  I have corrected all of the issues with Stitcher.
[02:33.470 --> 02:36.310]  It should work on all devices at this time.
[02:36.790 --> 02:38.670]  I've tested it on several devices.
[02:38.830 --> 02:42.870]  Mike has the exact device on which Stitcher was failing and both of the new
[02:42.890 --> 02:45.990]  episodes have worked there. So if this one works on Mike's phone,
[02:45.990 --> 02:49.310]  that is three in a row, I will feel like we have solved the issue.
[02:49.550 --> 02:51.590]  Stitcher just put out a brand new update.
[02:51.590 --> 02:55.590]  So make sure you download the new update on Stitcher radio and the show will
[02:55.590 --> 03:00.350]  work. The old episodes won't correct themselves. Starting at episode 351,
[03:00.350 --> 03:03.070]  Stitcher should be repaired on all devices.
[03:03.990 --> 03:06.750]  So I want to give a huge shout out to everybody at Stitcher. Big shout out,
[03:06.750 --> 03:08.190]  big thanks to the support team.
[03:08.390 --> 03:11.230]  We did a lot of work together to get that problem solved.
[03:11.250 --> 03:12.470]  So big thanks to them.
[03:12.510 --> 03:17.190]  Also big thank you to everybody who politely and gently reached out to me and
[03:17.190 --> 03:20.990]  said, Hey bro, your show is not working on Stitcher. I do appreciate that help.
[03:21.630 --> 03:25.750]  Sometimes I don't know when there's a tech issue on my website, on my podcast,
[03:25.750 --> 03:29.190]  on my YouTube channel, on my social media, maybe I'm not aware.
[03:29.190 --> 03:33.110]  So those gentle notifications are appreciated. Thank you for the help.
[03:33.310 --> 03:37.430]  Thank you for the support. A lot of times I say, this is just a one man show.
[03:37.470 --> 03:38.270]  It is just me.
[03:38.270 --> 03:42.590]  I read genetics as all me from doing the breeding, the selection,
[03:42.630 --> 03:45.050]  all the growing, most of the photography.
[03:45.050 --> 03:47.470]  I give a lot of the photography credit to other folks when they take the
[03:47.490 --> 03:47.890]  pictures,
[03:47.890 --> 03:50.810]  but most of the photography is mine because I have the plants first.
[03:50.810 --> 03:54.970]  I get to take the first pictures. So the breeding, the growing, the photography,
[03:54.970 --> 03:58.510]  the social media, all of the email and dealing with vendors,
[03:58.650 --> 04:03.490]  all of that is handled by myself. So that company is just me. Also,
[04:03.550 --> 04:07.370]  I'm the grow from your heart podcast. I write all of the episodes.
[04:07.650 --> 04:10.090]  I host and produce all of the episodes.
[04:10.290 --> 04:14.570]  I edit every single episode and I make the videos for every single episode.
[04:14.590 --> 04:16.450]  I also do all of the internet work.
[04:16.450 --> 04:19.490]  I've got a friend that does a lot of the website work, but for the podcast,
[04:19.730 --> 04:23.210]  I don't need his help. I do all of the internet work for the podcast on my own.
[04:23.490 --> 04:26.850]  So I am running the grow from your heart podcast. I'm running,
[04:26.850 --> 04:30.610]  I read genetics, the seed company. Also I'm somebody's dad.
[04:30.810 --> 04:35.610]  So I'm a busy person, but often I say that it is a one man show over here.
[04:35.810 --> 04:36.630]  Honestly,
[04:36.770 --> 04:41.570]  I couldn't do a lot of what I do without the backup and support from all of my
[04:41.570 --> 04:44.890]  social media friends and my friends and family that are around me.
[04:45.530 --> 04:49.010]  I don't really allow anybody to put their hands in the projects.
[04:49.030 --> 04:51.010]  That's all my work and it's my love,
[04:51.250 --> 04:54.930]  but I do allow them to support me in many other ways.
[04:55.010 --> 04:58.210]  And I do appreciate that support. It does not go unnoticed.
[04:58.210 --> 05:02.490]  So big shout out to the ivory army, the grow from your heart podcast family,
[05:02.730 --> 05:07.210]  and also all the people that come and help me in numerous ways. Thank you.
[05:07.450 --> 05:10.170]  And I do say this is a one man show. When I talk about the podcast,
[05:10.170 --> 05:14.450]  I do need to give a shout out to Mike who comes over and contributes heavily.
[05:14.610 --> 05:18.210]  And also a big shout out to every guest who has ever been on here and a big
[05:18.210 --> 05:22.250]  shout out to everybody who sends me emails and social media questions and
[05:22.250 --> 05:25.170]  comments and also everybody on the Instagram live,
[05:25.330 --> 05:29.690]  because I get a lot of podcast material from those resources.
[05:29.850 --> 05:33.530]  I have to come up with show content, two episodes a week out of my head.
[05:33.690 --> 05:37.690]  So a lot of your guys's questions, a lot of the comments that does inspire,
[05:37.690 --> 05:40.690]  great content. So thank you. And thank you for all of the support.
[05:40.930 --> 05:45.890]  That's what I was trying to get at. Now, speaking of listener generated content,
[05:45.890 --> 05:50.410]  my next segment comes from my listeners. A few episodes back,
[05:50.450 --> 05:54.250]  I asked if you could smoke a joint with anybody living or dead,
[05:54.530 --> 05:56.490]  who would you choose to smoke with?
[05:56.530 --> 05:59.210]  I got a lot of creative and interesting answers.
[05:59.490 --> 06:02.810]  Let's just run right through them. All right.
[06:02.810 --> 06:04.650]  Our first response comes from Instagram.
[06:04.650 --> 06:08.490]  This one was left by somebody who calls themselves morning do 72. What's up, bro?
[06:08.730 --> 06:12.250]  He says, would have been cool to smoke with Robin Williams, circa,
[06:12.290 --> 06:15.810]  Mork and Mindy. Robin Williams was always hilarious.
[06:15.810 --> 06:17.850]  He was extra funny during the Mork and Mindy years.
[06:18.090 --> 06:19.570]  That would have been a great time.
[06:19.570 --> 06:22.970]  Get stoned with Robin Williams and watch them get goofy and make those funny,
[06:22.970 --> 06:25.690]  silly noises. That would have been hilarious.
[06:26.090 --> 06:30.370]  So I really appreciate that reply. Thanks for the input. Morning do 72.
[06:30.370 --> 06:33.930]  I've got another screenshot with a whole bunch of great replies. This one says,
[06:33.930 --> 06:36.370]  dude, could you imagine tripping with Jimi Hendrix?
[06:36.410 --> 06:39.970]  That's because this person said they would like to smoke with Jimi Hendrix.
[06:39.970 --> 06:41.410]  And I was like, bro, if you're going to hang with Jimi,
[06:41.410 --> 06:43.370]  are you sure all you want to do is smoke some weed?
[06:43.370 --> 06:46.930]  So that conversation got a little out of control, but shout out to tip top Magoo.
[06:46.930 --> 06:50.850]  We talked about smoking with Jimi Hendrix and we also talked about taking it a
[06:50.850 --> 06:53.810]  little further with Jimi. Of course, right? If you're hanging out with Jimi,
[06:54.090 --> 06:58.570]  you do as Jimi do. All right. Our next reply comes from my friend, Clint.
[06:58.570 --> 06:59.970]  What's up, Clint? Good to hear from you, bro.
[06:59.970 --> 07:04.930]  Clint says Trump today to try and figure out what his game plan
[07:04.930 --> 07:06.330]  is. That is a very good reply.
[07:06.330 --> 07:08.890]  I'm sure a lot of people want to know what the fuck his game plan is.
[07:09.170 --> 07:12.610]  And just to see Trump nice and stoned, that may change him. That may, uh,
[07:12.810 --> 07:16.290]  it may open his eyes and may make him on our team. Yeah.
[07:16.290 --> 07:18.250]  I just realized I said it would open his eyes.
[07:18.250 --> 07:22.330]  Hopefully it will make his eyes droopy and open his heart. That's what I meant.
[07:22.490 --> 07:24.290]  Let's move forward with Twitter replies.
[07:24.610 --> 07:28.810]  This one says from our friend Aldridge, it says my pops whenever,
[07:28.810 --> 07:30.730]  and wherever I never got the chance.
[07:30.730 --> 07:33.810]  I knew a lot of people would reach out and say that they wish they got a chance
[07:33.810 --> 07:35.810]  to smoke with their old man. I kind of expected that.
[07:35.810 --> 07:38.410]  So much respect for that reply. Thanks for that one, my friend.
[07:38.690 --> 07:43.770]  Then our other friend Damian, who goes by free market capitalist,
[07:43.770 --> 07:46.330]  it's kind of spelled awkwardly on it on Twitter, but you'll find it.
[07:46.330 --> 07:50.490]  If you look for him, he says Ernest Hemingway in Paris in the twenties.
[07:50.490 --> 07:52.970]  I think that is a great response.
[07:54.090 --> 07:56.010]  Everything was so much different in the twenties.
[07:56.050 --> 07:59.850]  I bet you'll find everybody is more calm and more peaceful.
[07:59.850 --> 08:04.610]  And the conversations are more rich and people actually look you in the eye and
[08:04.610 --> 08:06.010]  there's no cell phone to pull out.
[08:06.010 --> 08:08.970]  So not everybody's wondering what's happening on Twitter and Instagram.
[08:08.970 --> 08:12.370]  It would be so much better to sit down and have a talk.
[08:12.370 --> 08:15.090]  Then what are you going to do at the end of the hangout when you can't pull out
[08:15.090 --> 08:18.330]  your phone and take a little Instagram shot with Hemingway,
[08:18.330 --> 08:22.170]  you're going to be all right. That's going to be the only downfall to that one,
[08:22.170 --> 08:23.730]  bro. I hope you get to live out your dream.
[08:23.890 --> 08:27.850]  I hope one day we get to get some time travel devices and we get to legally take
[08:27.890 --> 08:32.690]  our cannabis with us to the past and go smoke out our heroes.
[08:32.690 --> 08:34.810]  I'm going to move forward because this is getting weird quickly.
[08:35.810 --> 08:39.450]  Our friend couch glow on Twitter said he would like to smoke with Terrence
[08:39.450 --> 08:41.130]  McKenna in 1990.
[08:41.490 --> 08:45.490]  I would definitely like to be a part of that smoke session.
[08:45.810 --> 08:50.050]  Terrence McKenna was a, an activist and a spokesperson for psychedelics.
[08:50.290 --> 08:54.010]  He may have been an ethno pharmacologist may have been his official title.
[08:54.010 --> 08:56.890]  I didn't do any research before the show, but I think that's what he went by.
[08:57.170 --> 09:01.210]  Terrence McKenna was all about psychedelics and the psychedelic experience and
[09:01.210 --> 09:05.650]  opening your mind. He did not smoke a lot of cannabis. He was not a pothead.
[09:05.650 --> 09:09.530]  He said the best way to consume cannabis was to go for long periods of time
[09:09.770 --> 09:12.050]  without smoking. And then when you do smoke,
[09:12.250 --> 09:16.170]  smoke as much as you can possibly handle. And that's how you smoke cannabis.
[09:16.650 --> 09:20.170]  So he had a different approach than most of us, but he went extreme.
[09:20.170 --> 09:24.530]  Imagine if you didn't smoke for 60 days and you went in and took a giant dab.
[09:24.770 --> 09:28.290]  Imagine how psychedelic and brand new that would be.
[09:28.450 --> 09:30.650]  That was his smoking experience every time.
[09:30.650 --> 09:33.370]  So Terrence McKenna would be a great smoking experience.
[09:33.370 --> 09:35.170]  Maybe you don't get him so high. He can't function.
[09:35.410 --> 09:37.250]  Just a few puffs to open both of your minds.
[09:37.490 --> 09:40.890]  And then you can sit there and have that talk about spirituality and psychedelia
[09:41.130 --> 09:44.450]  and all the things that he hasn't been able to talk about, bro. He spoke a lot.
[09:44.450 --> 09:48.330]  So I'm sure you've heard a lot of his stuff by now. Great reply. I like that.
[09:48.810 --> 09:51.330]  Thanks for that one. Couch glow. Our next one says,
[09:51.370 --> 09:54.290]  I read an article about Willie Nelson before this podcast.
[09:54.290 --> 09:58.330]  So I imagine I have to say, Oh Willie. And that's from our friend Mileman5280.
[09:59.530 --> 10:02.730]  I knew I would get at least one Willie Nelson. So that's a great one.
[10:02.730 --> 10:07.090]  I expected that. I hope you enjoy your smoke sesh with old Willie one day.
[10:07.090 --> 10:10.210]  I heard Willie could smoke some weed. So come prepared.
[10:11.010 --> 10:15.730]  The next tweet is from The Canna Crat. And he said, my dad passed in 99.
[10:15.730 --> 10:19.090]  So not a fair pick, but I tweeted Bourdain a bunch of times,
[10:19.090 --> 10:22.210]  jokingly inviting him to burn one before he passed.
[10:22.530 --> 10:25.610]  That would have been a cool one. Of course he means Anthony Bourdain,
[10:25.610 --> 10:28.250]  who recently passed. That would have been really fun.
[10:28.250 --> 10:29.490]  He was a very creative person.
[10:29.490 --> 10:32.370]  He was very open-minded and he's been a lot of places.
[10:32.690 --> 10:37.450]  I believe he is a practitioner of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and he does consume
[10:37.450 --> 10:38.610]  cannabis regularly.
[10:38.810 --> 10:42.090]  So he would have known how to just chill out and smoke and have a conversation
[10:42.090 --> 10:43.930]  with you. That would have been a great time.
[10:44.050 --> 10:47.650]  Maybe go eat some weird food with him. Maybe go do some Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
[10:47.890 --> 10:51.490]  That would have been fun. I like that. There's a little bit more to this tweet.
[10:51.650 --> 10:55.010]  He also says one more to break the rules.
[10:55.370 --> 11:00.050]  One more dead would be Joe Strummer. One more alive Rasta Jeff 420.
[11:00.250 --> 11:03.970]  So his choices were his pops. Of course, a lot of people chose their pops.
[11:03.970 --> 11:06.490]  I respect that. Then he chose Anthony Bourdain,
[11:06.490 --> 11:09.690]  which would have been a lot of fun. Then he chose Joe Strummer.
[11:09.810 --> 11:11.010]  That would always be a good time.
[11:11.010 --> 11:14.130]  All the rock stars are going to be fun to smoke with. And then his next choice,
[11:14.370 --> 11:17.010]  Rasta Jeff 420. That is an honor, my friend.
[11:17.010 --> 11:19.730]  I am honored to be in that list of great people. Uh, dude,
[11:19.890 --> 11:21.810]  let's get together and take some dabs.
[11:22.690 --> 11:24.210]  Hopefully I'll be around for a little while.
[11:24.250 --> 11:26.970]  So you got some time to plan that trip, dude. Thanks for the great tweet.
[11:26.970 --> 11:31.210]  Everybody. I appreciate that. Let's see if we've got any more. Um,
[11:31.250 --> 11:34.770]  let's see. Aldridge says congrats on five years of consecutive Mondays.
[11:34.770 --> 11:37.170]  I know that's random, but Hey dude, thanks for that one.
[11:37.530 --> 11:42.370]  I also asked when you smoke with your favorite person or with your person of
[11:42.390 --> 11:46.010]  choice, what strain are you going to smoke? So far as I record this,
[11:46.010 --> 11:49.970]  I've only gotten one reply and that reply was strawberry cough.
[11:49.970 --> 11:52.690]  And that came from our friend free market capitalist.
[11:53.650 --> 11:57.530]  So big thanks to everybody who sent me replies. And now I will ask the question.
[11:57.690 --> 12:00.930]  Once again, it's never too late to send in your Twitter replies,
[12:00.950 --> 12:02.450]  or you can email me. Uh,
[12:02.450 --> 12:06.530]  if you were able to smoke with any one person living or dead,
[12:06.730 --> 12:11.330]  who would you choose to smoke a joint with? And if that person is dead,
[12:11.810 --> 12:16.050]  what era of their life would you bring them back from to smoke with them?
[12:16.570 --> 12:20.490]  Would you choose to smoke with that person right before they got famous or when
[12:20.490 --> 12:23.650]  they got famous or right at the height of their career, whoever it is,
[12:23.850 --> 12:26.570]  you know, when you want to join them for a smoke, let me know.
[12:26.690 --> 12:31.490]  Also I want to know what strain you're going to smoke with this person.
[12:31.490 --> 12:36.110]  What are you going to roll up to smoke with your one favorite smoke buddy?
[12:36.290 --> 12:40.130]  Send me an email. It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com or find me on Twitter.
[12:40.250 --> 12:43.450]  It's at G F Y H podcast.
[12:44.250 --> 12:48.010]  Now I guess it's only fair that I share with you who I would choose to smoke
[12:48.010 --> 12:48.730]  with.
[12:48.730 --> 12:52.170]  I think I said in a previous episode that the person I would choose to smoke
[12:52.170 --> 12:54.970]  with who is dead would be my gramps.
[12:55.250 --> 13:00.250]  I would like to go back somewhere between 1995 and 2005 and smoke with my
[13:01.410 --> 13:03.090]  gramps. He was a really cool old guy.
[13:03.490 --> 13:08.490]  I think around 95 to 2005 was when I was becoming adults enough to enjoy my
[13:10.250 --> 13:14.130]  an adult conversation with him and smoke a joint with him and be mature enough
[13:14.130 --> 13:16.650]  to take it as an adult thing.
[13:16.690 --> 13:20.330]  Not like a disrespectful kid getting high with the old man sort of thing.
[13:20.690 --> 13:23.050]  I think there would have been a different level of respect around then.
[13:23.450 --> 13:26.290]  Also he was in good health at that time.
[13:26.330 --> 13:29.730]  He was physically and mentally doing pretty well in that time period.
[13:29.730 --> 13:33.650]  So there's about a 10 year timeframe where I think I really would have enjoyed
[13:33.770 --> 13:37.970]  smoking a joint with my grandpa. So that would have been my, my dead pick,
[13:37.970 --> 13:41.850]  my alive pick. Uh, that took a little bit of thinking. I am spoiled.
[13:41.850 --> 13:46.330]  I live in Colorado where we get a lot more opportunity to smoke with a lot more
[13:46.330 --> 13:48.490]  people. I am in the cannabis industry,
[13:48.490 --> 13:51.770]  which gives me even more opportunity to smoke with more people.
[13:52.210 --> 13:57.210]  I am a six foot five white guy with dreadlocks almost to my knees.
[13:58.330 --> 14:02.490]  So that gives me a little more opportunity to smoke with more people. You guys,
[14:02.490 --> 14:05.730]  if I go to a reggae concert at a theater or a small club,
[14:06.050 --> 14:10.130]  I can just walk right past security because they think I'm in the band or part
[14:10.130 --> 14:13.690]  of the band. So if I take good herb to a reggae show, when the show's over,
[14:13.730 --> 14:16.530]  I walk backstage and go smoke with the reggae band.
[14:16.570 --> 14:21.290]  It's pretty easy being Rasta Jeff sometimes. So I am spoiled. Also,
[14:22.250 --> 14:26.650]  I've made friends with some folks at comedy works where I may end up in a lot of
[14:26.650 --> 14:30.850]  smoke sessions with comedians before and or after comedy shows.
[14:30.930 --> 14:34.570]  Allegedly, maybe I really don't want to get anybody in any trouble,
[14:34.570 --> 14:38.250]  but everybody has seen the pictures of Doug Benson and myself smoking after the
[14:38.250 --> 14:42.170]  shows at comedy works. So I've made friends with a lot of comedians like that.
[14:42.170 --> 14:44.610]  A lot of them don't want pictures of us smoking out.
[14:44.610 --> 14:47.090]  A lot of it doesn't happen in a place where I can take a picture,
[14:47.450 --> 14:50.530]  but I do get spoiled. I've smoked with a lot of people.
[14:50.530 --> 14:54.930]  I've smoked hash with Joey Diaz. I've smoked countless times with Doug Benson.
[14:55.210 --> 14:59.210]  I've gotten a few comedians so high that they had to delay the show and go on
[14:59.210 --> 15:00.030]  late.
[15:00.030 --> 15:03.970]  One time I was the only guy with weed and a pipe at the high plains comedy
[15:04.010 --> 15:08.330]  festival where a lot of headliners wanted to smoke some weed.
[15:08.330 --> 15:12.570]  So I got spoiled that day and got to meet a lot of mine and your favorite
[15:12.570 --> 15:13.050]  comedians.
[15:13.050 --> 15:16.330]  I got to just sit in the green room and just smoke out everybody that came
[15:16.330 --> 15:18.250]  through that day. That was a great time.
[15:18.450 --> 15:20.570]  Shout out to my friend who put me in that position.
[15:20.570 --> 15:23.010]  He knows who he is and he probably is listening right now.
[15:23.170 --> 15:26.290]  He does not want his name said, thank you, bro. I appreciate that.
[15:26.770 --> 15:31.450]  But my point is I have smoked with a lot of musicians and comedians and most of
[15:31.450 --> 15:32.770]  the people I want to smoke with.
[15:33.490 --> 15:37.410]  The one person at the top of my list that I would like to smoke with that I have
[15:37.430 --> 15:41.570]  not had the opportunity to shake his hand or smoke some weed with him would be
[15:41.590 --> 15:42.410]  Joe Rogan.
[15:42.530 --> 15:46.130]  I would love to just meet Joe and smoke and have a conversation.
[15:46.330 --> 15:49.370]  I would be super honored to be on the show, but there's no need for that.
[15:49.610 --> 15:54.610]  But Joe Rogan has always had my attention for years before he got super popular.
[15:54.650 --> 15:57.490]  I've been listening to his comedy. I've been watching his videos.
[15:57.810 --> 15:59.850]  I've been watching the podcast since the beginning.
[16:00.010 --> 16:04.250]  So it would be an honor to smoke with Joe Rogan would probably be my number one
[16:04.250 --> 16:04.930]  pick.
[16:04.930 --> 16:09.330]  A close second would be Snoop Dogg because who doesn't want to smoke a joint
[16:09.530 --> 16:12.210]  with Uncle Snoop? Imagine how fun that would be.
[16:12.890 --> 16:15.610]  I think Snoop is hilarious and he's super chill.
[16:15.610 --> 16:18.290]  So you could just smoke a joint and just sit there and laugh at shit,
[16:18.290 --> 16:22.130]  probably get some food, listen to some good music. I think it'd be a good time.
[16:22.150 --> 16:25.410]  So my first choice of living person would be Rogan.
[16:25.430 --> 16:28.250]  My backup plan would be Snoop. And if I could time travel,
[16:28.450 --> 16:31.730]  I would try to smoke a joint with my gramps.
[16:32.650 --> 16:35.410]  Imagine what's going to happen when we time travel and go back in the day and
[16:35.410 --> 16:39.010]  try to smoke dabs with these people who aren't even familiar too much with
[16:39.010 --> 16:40.970]  cannabis. Like, yo, what are you doing?
[16:41.010 --> 16:44.490]  What the fuck happened to weed in the future? They're going to be confused.
[16:45.490 --> 16:45.730]  All right.
[16:45.730 --> 16:49.810]  The next part of the podcast was inspired by my friends who were worried about
[16:49.810 --> 16:52.450]  and who were dealing with Hurricane Florence.
[16:52.770 --> 16:56.450]  I was talking with a friend who was very concerned with how to keep his plants
[16:56.490 --> 16:59.170]  alive during the hurricane. If power goes out,
[16:59.370 --> 17:02.370]  what is he going to do to keep the environment dialed in?
[17:02.650 --> 17:05.650]  What is he going to do to keep the lights on schedule?
[17:05.890 --> 17:10.810]  And I had a couple of pieces of advice that I feel like really made him at ease
[17:10.970 --> 17:12.810]  during this emergency time.
[17:13.690 --> 17:16.850]  Now my friend's main concern was interrupting the light cycle.
[17:16.870 --> 17:20.370]  He did not want to disrupt the current light cycle. He's on 1212.
[17:20.370 --> 17:21.410]  He's in the middle of flower.
[17:21.730 --> 17:24.290]  And he knows that if he disrupts that light cycle too much,
[17:24.850 --> 17:28.410]  he gives the plants the opportunity to turn into hermaphrodites,
[17:28.410 --> 17:32.450]  which will seed his crop, which will potentially cost him income.
[17:32.970 --> 17:36.090]  Now here was my main piece of advice to my friend.
[17:37.090 --> 17:41.370]  Our plants are tolerant of interruptions of the day cycle.
[17:41.770 --> 17:46.570]  However, our plants are not tolerant to interruptions of the night
[17:46.570 --> 17:47.410]  cycle.
[17:47.570 --> 17:52.290]  So if you have a power failure during the light cycle and the lights go off for a
[17:52.290 --> 17:54.730]  little while, your plants will be okay.
[17:55.010 --> 17:58.610]  They won't get that light energy and they'll miss that growth for that amount of
[17:58.610 --> 18:03.210]  time, but it will not turn them into herms. On the opposite,
[18:03.690 --> 18:06.370]  if your plants get light during their night cycle,
[18:06.610 --> 18:08.490]  you are definitely risking issues.
[18:08.490 --> 18:13.490]  You are risking causing hermaphrodite flowers and seeds in your crop.
[18:14.370 --> 18:18.610]  So the first piece of advice was don't worry too much about interruptions of the
[18:18.650 --> 18:22.930]  day cycle, but focus strongly on interruptions of the night cycle.
[18:23.890 --> 18:27.970]  My next piece of guidance was that if they're getting frequent interruptions in
[18:27.970 --> 18:32.770]  electricity and the light is going on for two hours and then maybe off for 15
[18:32.770 --> 18:36.690]  minutes and then on for 15 and then off during the day cycle,
[18:37.050 --> 18:41.650]  it may be best just to unplug that light until you get the electrical issue
[18:41.650 --> 18:42.490]  solved.
[18:42.610 --> 18:47.610]  I think the plant would react better to just having a long dark period than
[18:48.730 --> 18:53.730]  a day where I had two hours of light and then 15 minutes of dark and then 15
[18:53.850 --> 18:56.370]  minutes of light and then some random time of dark.
[18:56.370 --> 18:58.890]  And then the lights went off for a couple of minutes and then they came back on
[18:59.410 --> 19:02.970]  and then we had our normal 12 hour dark cycle and the lights came on for about an
[19:02.970 --> 19:05.890]  hour and then they went off again randomly and then they got back on.
[19:06.250 --> 19:10.330]  I would just leave the lights off, having them come off and on and off and on like
[19:10.330 --> 19:10.690]  that.
[19:10.690 --> 19:14.970]  Those will probably cause more issues than just an extended dark period until the
[19:14.970 --> 19:15.930]  problem is solved.
[19:16.210 --> 19:18.810]  Also, that's going to put stress on your equipment.
[19:19.370 --> 19:23.410]  Having the hot bulbs reignite is not good for the bulbs or the ballast,
[19:23.530 --> 19:24.450]  so avoid that.
[19:25.010 --> 19:29.970]  I would recommend leaving on the fans and the blowers until the very last minute.
[19:30.250 --> 19:32.810]  If you decide to unplug the lights because they're flickering,
[19:33.090 --> 19:36.290]  leave the blowers plugged in because you still want airflow in your room.
[19:36.290 --> 19:39.450]  You don't want it to get stale and it's not going to hurt the fans and blowers
[19:39.450 --> 19:41.730]  too much if they go off and come on too frequently.
[19:42.050 --> 19:45.330]  It's the bulbs and ballast that we're going to do damage to and it's also the
[19:45.330 --> 19:46.890]  plants that are going to get annoyed.
[19:47.170 --> 19:50.290]  How do you like it if I just walk in the room and turn the lights off randomly
[19:50.330 --> 19:53.650]  then walk back by and turn them back on and piss you off eventually too.
[19:53.850 --> 19:58.010]  So if you've got flickering, if you've got intermittent power failures,
[19:58.290 --> 20:01.770]  just unplug the lights until the power is fixed and the plants will probably like
[20:01.770 --> 20:05.330]  you for that more than they would like you if you just let them get flickered
[20:05.370 --> 20:07.210]  off and on through the entire storm.
[20:07.690 --> 20:09.810]  Another thing to think about is you may get a lot of water.
[20:09.850 --> 20:11.290]  I'm not, I've never been in a hurricane.
[20:11.290 --> 20:12.650]  I don't know what this is going to be like.
[20:12.970 --> 20:14.250]  Are you electrically safe?
[20:14.530 --> 20:16.810]  Maybe just unplug things anyway.
[20:17.050 --> 20:19.690]  You're going to have the chance of a lot of water coming into that house.
[20:19.730 --> 20:23.970]  If you were evacuated or if you feel like the water is getting close, unplug
[20:23.970 --> 20:27.290]  your stuff so that the ballast and the bulbs aren't plugged in when the water
[20:27.290 --> 20:28.970]  comes, I don't know the situation.
[20:28.970 --> 20:32.730]  I don't know how bad it's going to get, but if you were evacuated, unplug your
[20:32.730 --> 20:34.730]  shit before you leave, unplug everything.
[20:34.730 --> 20:37.890]  I would just go turn off the breakers, just flip the breaker in the garage.
[20:38.050 --> 20:39.490]  Make sure that there's no power going.
[20:40.490 --> 20:43.450]  Now, if you're in veg, you're going to need some light on your
[20:43.450 --> 20:46.170]  plants or they will start to flower.
[20:46.450 --> 20:49.490]  Some plants will start to flower within 24 hours.
[20:49.690 --> 20:54.410]  Some will need 48 hours or more, but if we don't get some light on them, they
[20:54.410 --> 20:56.890]  may start the flowering process.
[20:57.650 --> 21:01.530]  Your veg plants don't need a lot of light for very long to
[21:01.530 --> 21:03.010]  prevent them from flowering.
[21:03.690 --> 21:08.850]  If you have a strong battery powered flashlight or one of those industrial
[21:09.130 --> 21:12.610]  flashlights that takes the square battery, the big square battery, if
[21:12.610 --> 21:13.730]  you've got one, you know what I mean.
[21:14.130 --> 21:18.170]  If you've got that type of flashlight, you can shine that over your plants
[21:18.850 --> 21:22.490]  for three, maybe seven, maybe 10 minutes at the most, and that'll keep them
[21:22.490 --> 21:27.090]  awake if you do that every six hours or so, they'll go, oh, we don't need to
[21:27.090 --> 21:30.170]  flower, they go in there and you wake them up, they just trigger them to wake
[21:30.170 --> 21:33.050]  up and then it takes a little while for them to fall back to sleep and they
[21:33.050 --> 21:36.690]  don't ever get the idea that they've gotten 12 hours of uninterrupted
[21:36.690 --> 21:38.930]  darkness and they will not start to flower.
[21:39.170 --> 21:42.210]  So just go in there every six hours or so and just shine a
[21:42.210 --> 21:43.330]  bunch of bright light on them.
[21:43.330 --> 21:45.130]  I understand you may not have electricity.
[21:45.410 --> 21:47.650]  That's why I'm recommending flashlights.
[21:47.850 --> 21:50.210]  Try the weak flashlight on your phone.
[21:50.450 --> 21:52.330]  Maybe that'll work if it's all you've got.
[21:52.930 --> 21:55.650]  Hopefully you can still charge your phone with your car.
[21:55.890 --> 21:57.770]  So you've got a little bit of power.
[21:57.770 --> 21:59.050]  You've got that little flashlight.
[21:59.290 --> 22:00.570]  Maybe that will work for you.
[22:00.770 --> 22:04.650]  It's going to depend on the size of the plants, the age of the plants, the
[22:04.650 --> 22:06.370]  genetics, and a lot of other things.
[22:06.370 --> 22:09.890]  But that's one way to prevent those plants from going into
[22:09.890 --> 22:11.730]  flower during a power outage.
[22:12.290 --> 22:15.410]  So that's my advice for how to handle this hurricane season
[22:15.610 --> 22:17.090]  and random power outages.
[22:17.410 --> 22:20.650]  The most important piece of advice is to make sure that you, your
[22:20.650 --> 22:23.250]  loved ones, and your pets are safe.
[22:23.290 --> 22:25.810]  If they say evacuate, don't be a stubborn asshole.
[22:26.010 --> 22:26.730]  Evacuate.
[22:26.930 --> 22:27.330]  I get it.
[22:27.370 --> 22:28.250]  That's all your stuff.
[22:28.450 --> 22:29.090]  That's your house.
[22:29.290 --> 22:30.250]  That's your livelihood.
[22:30.730 --> 22:31.210]  I get it.
[22:31.370 --> 22:33.610]  But you've got to get out of there so that you don't get hurt.
[22:33.810 --> 22:37.450]  And then nobody else gets hurt trying to rescue your dumb ass.
[22:37.490 --> 22:39.490]  So get out of there when they say evacuate.
[22:39.730 --> 22:40.610]  That is my advice.
[22:40.850 --> 22:41.810]  Take care of yourself.
[22:41.890 --> 22:44.250]  Take care of your family and take care of your pets.
[22:44.450 --> 22:48.170]  And if you need to help somebody else out, do what you can and be very careful.
[22:48.650 --> 22:52.130]  So that is my hurricane and interrupted light cycle advice.
[22:52.130 --> 22:56.410]  If you have problems or you suspect you'll have repeated problems, just unplug it and
[22:56.410 --> 22:58.410]  you will save yourself some headaches.
[22:59.370 --> 23:01.570]  You guys, I know these episodes have been short lately.
[23:01.610 --> 23:03.530]  I've been trying to not be so rambly.
[23:03.530 --> 23:07.770]  I've been trying to keep a lot of info and a lot of details into the show without a lot
[23:07.770 --> 23:08.770]  of sidetrack crap.
[23:08.770 --> 23:11.970]  So I do apologize if the episodes feel short to you.
[23:11.970 --> 23:16.570]  I feel like it's better to have a short episode that is to the point than a rambly
[23:16.570 --> 23:19.290]  episode with a bunch of crap for people to fast forward through.
[23:19.610 --> 23:22.250]  I will get back to the grow lessons on the next episode.
[23:22.250 --> 23:24.170]  I just wanted to get these Twitter replies out.
[23:24.410 --> 23:27.850]  I also wanted to get to this hurricane question while it was kind of relevant.
[23:28.370 --> 23:31.610]  So I do understand that I've put out a couple of really short episodes.
[23:31.650 --> 23:33.930]  Under 30 minutes is really short in my opinion.
[23:34.690 --> 23:37.250]  But I feel like those episodes were right to the point.
[23:37.290 --> 23:40.090]  I'm going to try to keep the grow lessons nice and tight like that.
[23:40.090 --> 23:42.810]  There will be episodes like these where I come hang out and get rambly.
[23:42.810 --> 23:45.450]  But the grow lessons are going to be a little tighter.
[23:45.610 --> 23:49.610]  If the episodes don't require a long time, I'm just going to do a short episode.
[23:49.890 --> 23:53.930]  I guarantee there will be longer episodes because I have some highly detailed grow
[23:53.930 --> 23:56.410]  lessons coming your way very soon.
[23:56.970 --> 23:59.610]  Ladies and gentlemen, that is all I've got for you for this episode.
