[00:15.680 --> 00:21.680]  Welcome back, Cannabis Community. It's time for episode number 258 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:21.680 --> 00:24.680]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:24.680 --> 00:29.680]  That's right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:29.680 --> 00:34.680]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:34.680 --> 00:37.680]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:37.680 --> 00:41.680]  I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:41.680 --> 00:47.680]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:47.680 --> 00:52.680]  Big thanks to Kat, Coop, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:52.680 --> 00:57.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, you ask and you shall receive. White Mike is back in the house. Welcome to the show, brother.
[00:57.680 --> 01:00.680]  Thanks, man. What up, everybody?
[01:00.680 --> 01:04.680]  I left a moment so that everybody could applaud. That's why I was silent for a moment. In my mind, I just heard,
[01:05.680 --> 01:12.680]  and everybody was applauding. You guys, if you did not applaud heavily at that moment, I will allow you to rewind your podcast 15 seconds.
[01:12.680 --> 01:14.680]  And at that moment, I expect you to applaud in your car.
[01:14.680 --> 01:19.680]  That's what I do. On the off chance Stitcher grabs the episode correctly, there's a 30 second back button.
[01:19.680 --> 01:23.680]  Aw, poor Stitcher. For some reason, Stitcher keeps fucking up, but I think we've got it all corrected.
[01:23.680 --> 01:26.680]  You guys, for some reason, there's one episode that Stitcher will not take.
[01:26.680 --> 01:29.680]  Stitcher decided y'all don't get it.
[01:29.680 --> 01:32.680]  I apologize. I'm part of y'all on that, which is a little annoying.
[01:32.680 --> 01:34.680]  Yeah, Mike didn't get to hear it either. Mike listens on Stitcher.
[01:34.680 --> 01:37.680]  I will not. They've sent me emails like we fixed all your problems.
[01:37.680 --> 01:40.680]  And I'm like, this episode won't go on. They're like, sorry, but count them.
[01:40.680 --> 01:46.680]  Fuckhead. See those two numbers that are next to each other that don't go next to each other.
[01:46.680 --> 01:49.680]  Two fifty two, two fifty four, two fifty five. See the problem here.
[01:49.680 --> 01:53.680]  But no, but we're not going to come fuckheads because people do get to listen for free.
[01:53.680 --> 01:58.680]  So we're going to just be like, I'm sorry. I apologize. That's one throwback Thursday episode you will not get.
[01:59.680 --> 02:04.680]  But when the time comes, when that number falls in sequence, I will put it in the YouTube feed.
[02:04.680 --> 02:08.680]  It will happen there. Right. So you'll get it that way. I apologize.
[02:08.680 --> 02:12.680]  I could listen to it on iTunes. I'm just lazy.
[02:12.680 --> 02:15.680]  There are other ways to listen to it, I'm sure. I apologize, guys.
[02:15.680 --> 02:19.680]  I don't know what to do, but Stitcher just pretty much gave me the big purple middle finger.
[02:19.680 --> 02:23.680]  Go to the website and listen. I don't know. The website's a piece of shit. It's embarrassing.
[02:23.680 --> 02:25.680]  That's why I said people could find other ways to listen.
[02:25.680 --> 02:28.680]  I didn't want to encourage that piece of shit website being visited.
[02:28.680 --> 02:32.680]  Hey, it listens just fine. Yeah, you can go there if you'd like, you guys. It's not that bad.
[02:32.680 --> 02:36.680]  As far as two fifty three is concerned, it's way better than Stitcher.
[02:36.680 --> 02:41.680]  Hey, since I mentioned on the last episode that I met Mr. Jinxproof.
[02:41.680 --> 02:44.680]  I couldn't tell you. Stitcher didn't let me listen.
[02:44.680 --> 02:47.680]  No, that was just a throwback Thursday episode you missed.
[02:47.680 --> 02:51.680]  So, yeah, just a quick shout out to a few friends.
[02:51.680 --> 02:56.680]  If you're not aware of Jinxproof, a big shout out to a breeder known as Jinxproof, breeder of the nine pound hammer
[02:56.680 --> 03:00.680]  and several other award winning strains, notable strains.
[03:00.680 --> 03:06.680]  Jinxproof came to a grocery store in Pueblo West, Colorado and hung out.
[03:06.680 --> 03:12.680]  Just hung out and visited, did a little bit of a seed exchange and gave some advice, gave some talking.
[03:12.680 --> 03:20.680]  Jinxproof is a very positive dude. Jinxproof has an autistic son and they do autistic autism awareness.
[03:20.680 --> 03:24.680]  He's got a very cool wife named Miss Rose. He didn't bring the son or the wife, but he came and hung out.
[03:24.680 --> 03:27.680]  I want to give a big shout out to my friend Dung Beetle for inviting me.
[03:27.680 --> 03:34.680]  Also, it was random because I was standing there and a dude walked up to me and he goes, hey, is this where Jinxproof is going to be?
[03:34.680 --> 03:37.680]  And I was like, yeah, he goes, are you Rasta Jeff? And I was like, yeah, man, that's me.
[03:37.680 --> 03:40.680]  And he's like, dude, my name's Bag Seed Jesse and I listen to the fucking podcast.
[03:40.680 --> 03:47.680]  I was like, what's up, bro? So I met Bag Seed Jesse, who comments on my Instagram stuff quite a bit, who I've read his messages on the show before.
[03:47.680 --> 03:51.680]  So that was cool to meet him. Big shout out. I may have talked about this on a previous podcast.
[03:51.680 --> 03:54.680]  It feels like I also met a dude who goes by the name of Paperweight Seeds.
[03:54.680 --> 03:59.680]  Oh, I met Bag Seed Jesse's brother also. Can't think of the dude's name. Quiet guy. Cool dude, though.
[03:59.680 --> 04:03.680]  We had fun. Everybody kind of ditched us in the corner when we were hanging out, having a little session.
[04:03.680 --> 04:07.680]  But he's a cool guy. We got to hang out. Shout out to our friend Paperweight Seeds.
[04:07.680 --> 04:11.680]  I got to make some friends with some more growers and breeders.
[04:11.680 --> 04:15.680]  And also there was a guy there whose name I can't fucking remember. I feel bad.
[04:15.680 --> 04:18.680]  Him and I hung out quite a bit. He had some great turps.
[04:18.680 --> 04:20.680]  This happens at sessions.
[04:20.680 --> 04:24.680]  Yeah, when you smoke out and meet a bunch of people, you're bound to forget someone's name.
[04:24.680 --> 04:25.680]  Did I get too high to enunciate?
[04:25.680 --> 04:26.680]  I think you did.
[04:26.680 --> 04:28.680]  This could be interesting.
[04:28.680 --> 04:30.680]  This is going to be a very interesting podcast.
[04:30.680 --> 04:34.680]  So I just want to give a shout out to all my friends for hanging out.
[04:34.680 --> 04:39.680]  I got the opportunity to meet Jinxproof. Jinxproof is a very cool guy, very inspirational person, very positive guy.
[04:40.680 --> 04:47.680]  And it's weird because a lot of times when you meet people that you see on social media or that you followed on YouTube or whatever,
[04:47.680 --> 04:50.680]  when you meet them, they're not what they're cracked up to be.
[04:50.680 --> 04:52.680]  It happens a lot, unfortunately.
[04:52.680 --> 04:56.680]  You guys, I'm sorry. I get to meet a lot of people and a lot of people I meet are bags of shit.
[04:56.680 --> 04:58.680]  Jinxproof was cooler than I had imagined.
[04:58.680 --> 05:01.680]  He walked in and I was the first person he saw and I just stuck my fist out.
[05:01.680 --> 05:03.680]  I go, what's up, bro? Welcome. And gave him a fist bump.
[05:03.680 --> 05:05.680]  He goes, hey, brother. And just did his thing. You know what I mean?
[05:05.680 --> 05:07.680]  He walked in just like it was you or me.
[05:07.680 --> 05:11.680]  He's like, so what's up, man? What's going on, guys? Where do I need to be? How are things going? Sorry, I'm late.
[05:11.680 --> 05:15.680]  He was just a normal fucking dude and he hung out and he talked with us.
[05:15.680 --> 05:18.680]  And I let him do all of his like meet and greet business and shit.
[05:18.680 --> 05:22.680]  And then I went and talked to him and he was just super cool, super legit.
[05:22.680 --> 05:28.680]  He didn't smoke with us because we were smoking dabs and he's got epilepsy and he's afraid of butane, which I completely respected.
[05:28.680 --> 05:33.680]  But anyway, shout out to all my friends that set up the meet and greet with Jinxproof.
[05:33.680 --> 05:36.680]  That was a great fucking time.
[05:36.680 --> 05:39.680]  Mike mentioned how high we were and why we're so rambly.
[05:39.680 --> 05:44.680]  We got dabbed the fuck out on some Stardog OG Shatter from our friends at The Craft.
[05:44.680 --> 05:49.680]  I picked it up at Three Rivers. We smoked a whole bunch of that shit on an Instagram live video.
[05:49.680 --> 05:53.680]  We were on Instagram live way longer than we were supposed to be.
[05:53.680 --> 05:56.680]  We just meant to drop in and take a dab and we hung out for a long time.
[05:56.680 --> 05:59.680]  Got rambly. It got rambly, but they like it when we ramble.
[06:00.680 --> 06:03.680]  Let's see, where else are we in this?
[06:03.680 --> 06:06.680]  So shout out to all my friends that joined us on the Instagram live feed. That was fun.
[06:06.680 --> 06:09.680]  I appreciate that. I get a lot of inspiration for podcast stuff.
[06:09.680 --> 06:13.680]  I've written down so many notes from those conversations that we have on Instagram live.
[06:13.680 --> 06:16.680]  And I'm going to put them into podcasts.
[06:16.680 --> 06:21.680]  You may hear it in my voice, you guys. I am getting over a head cold, a chest cold, a nasty fucking situation.
[06:21.680 --> 06:25.680]  The whole growth is getting over a head cold right now. You can probably hear it in my lungs too.
[06:25.680 --> 06:30.680]  Yeah, everybody in our cultivation facility passed around this little cold like it was fucking the plague.
[06:30.680 --> 06:32.680]  It got passed around like a joint.
[06:32.680 --> 06:36.680]  Yeah, it sure did. Well, it's probably got something to do with us.
[06:36.680 --> 06:38.680]  Fucking safety meetings.
[06:38.680 --> 06:40.680]  May have something to do with all that shit.
[06:40.680 --> 06:44.680]  But yeah, I'm getting over it. It's Friday night and I'm finally recording.
[06:44.680 --> 06:47.680]  This episode will come out Monday as scheduled, but I am behind on my recording day.
[06:47.680 --> 06:49.680]  It makes me a little antsy, makes me anxious.
[06:49.680 --> 06:54.680]  I apologize for sounding kind of raspy and kind of shitty, but I've got a confession.
[06:54.680 --> 06:56.680]  Hey, you being late meant I could get over here and be on the show.
[06:56.680 --> 06:59.680]  That's the truth. And you've been asked to come back.
[06:59.680 --> 07:01.680]  So I'm glad that you're here, bro. Thanks for joining me.
[07:02.680 --> 07:08.680]  What I was going to confess to, however, is being cold and having a chest cold and having a sore throat for a couple of days.
[07:08.680 --> 07:18.680]  Oh, by the way, this is not an ad for any product, but if you take too much mucinex, holy fuck, you'll feel better and you'll feel better.
[07:18.680 --> 07:20.680]  Oh my God, that was a fucking adventure.
[07:20.680 --> 07:24.680]  A little bit extra mucinex and a fucking edible.
[07:24.680 --> 07:26.680]  Whoa, holy fuck.
[07:26.680 --> 07:30.680]  I'm guessing most of that was the, what'd you say? 120 milligrams of THC?
[07:30.680 --> 07:33.680]  Yeah, yeah. So I haven't eaten edibles, you guys, in over a year.
[07:33.680 --> 07:34.680]  You took a long...
[07:34.680 --> 07:38.680]  I took a long edible break, a really, really long edible break.
[07:38.680 --> 07:40.680]  And, uh...
[07:40.680 --> 07:42.680]  Definitely since well before March.
[07:42.680 --> 07:44.680]  I was gifted some edibles.
[07:44.680 --> 07:46.680]  Uh, and...
[07:47.680 --> 07:51.680]  I decided since I was sick and had a sore throat, it was time to munch them.
[07:51.680 --> 07:57.680]  So I got down on an Afgato bar, I ate 60 milligrams of it, and I was like, I kind of feel like I might be high.
[07:57.680 --> 08:00.680]  So I ate 60 more, and I was like, now I'm fucking high.
[08:00.680 --> 08:04.680]  120 milligrams, had my eyes a little red, and I was feeling a little loopy.
[08:04.680 --> 08:08.680]  And then I took a couple of small dabs just to fucking push me right there, and it got me...
[08:08.680 --> 08:09.680]  I was pretty lit.
[08:09.680 --> 08:12.680]  So I'm kind of back on the edibles train, you guys.
[08:12.680 --> 08:13.680]  I'm not going to go crazy.
[08:13.680 --> 08:17.680]  I don't want to be the super edible monster that I was for a while.
[08:17.680 --> 08:22.680]  You guys, it would not be a feat for me to eat a thousand milligrams in one sitting.
[08:22.680 --> 08:26.680]  That used to happen regularly.
[08:26.680 --> 08:28.680]  Once a week, once every two weeks.
[08:28.680 --> 08:29.680]  Yeah.
[08:29.680 --> 08:33.680]  I was hanging out with some guys that liked to do the thousand and the 2,500 milligram challenge.
[08:33.680 --> 08:34.680]  Yeah.
[08:34.680 --> 08:35.680]  Every once in a while.
[08:35.680 --> 08:38.680]  It started as a thousand, and within like a month, it was to 2,500.
[08:38.680 --> 08:40.680]  Well, yeah, because a thousand got easy.
[08:40.680 --> 08:41.680]  Like, you do...
[08:41.680 --> 08:43.680]  I've gotten really crazy metabolism.
[08:43.680 --> 08:46.680]  I could eat 120 milligrams and not be high in two hours.
[08:46.680 --> 08:49.680]  So I eat 250, and then I'm not high in two and a half hours.
[08:49.680 --> 08:53.680]  And then I eat 300, and then I'm just super high for an hour.
[08:53.680 --> 08:54.680]  All right.
[08:54.680 --> 08:55.680]  It just does like...
[08:55.680 --> 08:57.680]  It just all comes through at once.
[08:57.680 --> 09:02.680]  But once you start getting in like the thousands, that's when you start getting that like four-hour high.
[09:02.680 --> 09:05.680]  Once you eat that 2,500 milligram, you get this vision quest.
[09:05.680 --> 09:07.680]  I can do that to myself with like 30.
[09:07.680 --> 09:10.680]  Not the vision quest, but the bake for three hours.
[09:12.680 --> 09:14.680]  Sorry that the iPad rang.
[09:14.680 --> 09:15.680]  That might have interrupted the recording.
[09:15.680 --> 09:16.680]  I'm not sure.
[09:16.680 --> 09:18.680]  No, the iPad rang, though.
[09:18.680 --> 09:19.680]  That's really weird.
[09:19.680 --> 09:22.680]  I turned off all the phones, and the fucking iPad rang and tried to defeat us.
[09:22.680 --> 09:23.680]  It snitched on us.
[09:25.680 --> 09:26.680]  Sorry about that.
[09:26.680 --> 09:27.680]  That's very unprofessional.
[09:28.680 --> 09:31.680]  It did a really good job for the last hour.
[09:31.680 --> 09:33.680]  It just dropped the ball now.
[09:33.680 --> 09:37.680]  It doesn't have the little floppy thing like the phone does on the side to put it all the way down.
[09:37.680 --> 09:39.680]  So I can't turn it down.
[09:41.680 --> 09:42.680]  That's cool.
[09:42.680 --> 09:43.680]  We're just not even going to edit that.
[09:43.680 --> 09:45.680]  I apologize that you guys got to hear the iPad ring.
[09:45.680 --> 09:46.680]  Real life.
[09:46.680 --> 09:47.680]  That was awkward.
[09:47.680 --> 09:49.680]  Hey, Mike, where the fuck were we on this podcast?
[09:49.680 --> 09:50.680]  Edibles.
[09:50.680 --> 09:51.680]  Edibles.
[09:51.680 --> 09:52.680]  Too many edibles.
[09:52.680 --> 09:55.680]  The numbers you throw out are just insane to me.
[09:56.680 --> 10:04.680]  I eat 10 for pain management reasons, or I really like 10 of THC and 10 of CBD.
[10:04.680 --> 10:10.680]  There's not an intoxication that goes with that, but the pain relief I get from it is really nice.
[10:11.680 --> 10:17.680]  But if I up the THC to 25 or 30, I'm having fun for most of the night.
[10:18.680 --> 10:21.680]  I don't want any CBD in my mix.
[10:22.680 --> 10:27.680]  A friend of mine gave me one of the 100 milligram donuts for my birthday.
[10:27.680 --> 10:31.680]  And when I ate half of that, I was ruined for like four hours.
[10:33.680 --> 10:37.680]  Just like giggle high, like laughing at words, bro ads.
[10:38.680 --> 10:39.680]  Bro ads.
[10:39.680 --> 10:41.680]  Don't get us started on bro ads on our podcast.
[10:41.680 --> 10:43.680]  It was listo was the word that I died on that night.
[10:43.680 --> 10:45.680]  You learned in Spanish, buddy?
[10:45.680 --> 10:48.680]  One of the Davies books, there's English and Spanish.
[10:48.680 --> 10:49.680]  That's pretty cool, man.
[10:49.680 --> 10:51.680]  I'm glad you're teaching him Spanish.
[10:51.680 --> 10:55.680]  And the wife said listo, and I turned into a giggle puddle and had to leave the room.
[10:55.680 --> 11:00.680]  One of these days when you're old, you're going to hear the word listo and you're going to piss yourself and it's going to be hilarious.
[11:00.680 --> 11:01.680]  Yep.
[11:01.680 --> 11:02.680]  All right.
[11:02.680 --> 11:03.680]  Yeah.
[11:03.680 --> 11:05.680]  Well, yeah, you guys don't go trying to eat 2500 milligrams of edibles unless you're...
[11:05.680 --> 11:07.680]  Know your own tolerance.
[11:07.680 --> 11:08.680]  Yeah.
[11:08.680 --> 11:10.680]  Like Mike said, start off with like 30, 50.
[11:10.680 --> 11:11.680]  Go low.
[11:11.680 --> 11:13.680]  And you can always eat more, but you can't uneat those edibles.
[11:14.680 --> 11:16.680]  Once you eat the drugs, the drugs is in you.
[11:16.680 --> 11:17.680]  Yeah.
[11:17.680 --> 11:20.680]  Once you're spinning around, wishing you didn't do that, you're spinning around, wishing you didn't do that.
[11:20.680 --> 11:21.680]  All right.
[11:21.680 --> 11:22.680]  Did I mention what we're dabbing on?
[11:22.680 --> 11:23.680]  I did.
[11:23.680 --> 11:24.680]  We're smoking some Stardog OG Shatter.
[11:24.680 --> 11:27.680]  We had some, there's some Bordello on the table I'm going to dab.
[11:27.680 --> 11:29.680]  And then what did you give me a dab of Mike?
[11:29.680 --> 11:30.680]  It was good.
[11:30.680 --> 11:32.680]  You took some Chem 4 as well.
[11:32.680 --> 11:33.680]  Chem 4.
[11:33.680 --> 11:34.680]  Yes.
[11:34.680 --> 11:35.680]  Chem 4.
[11:35.680 --> 11:37.680]  I'm dabbing on some, I can never remember the name of this one.
[11:37.680 --> 11:38.680]  Jackie's Mission.
[11:38.680 --> 11:39.680]  Jackie's Mission.
[11:39.680 --> 11:40.680]  That's a CBD.
[11:40.680 --> 11:41.680]  I took a dab of that one earlier today.
[11:42.680 --> 11:43.680]  I really enjoyed the flavor.
[11:43.680 --> 11:45.680]  It made me so lazy.
[11:45.680 --> 11:50.680]  My knees and my lower back don't remember that it's Friday and it was a long, hard week.
[11:50.680 --> 11:51.680]  It was a long week.
[11:51.680 --> 11:53.680]  We just chilled out.
[11:53.680 --> 11:55.680]  Yeah, a lot happened this week.
[11:55.680 --> 11:56.680]  We were productive.
[11:56.680 --> 11:57.680]  We were quite productive.
[11:57.680 --> 11:58.680]  Good job.
[11:58.680 --> 12:03.680]  Good job to everybody out there busting your ass, especially all the people out there doing the outdoor harvest season.
[12:03.680 --> 12:04.680]  Oh, man.
[12:04.680 --> 12:06.680]  It's in full swing, big time now.
[12:06.680 --> 12:07.680]  Full swing.
[12:07.680 --> 12:09.680]  It's been a treacherous year for all the outdoor growers.
[12:09.680 --> 12:10.680]  Yep.
[12:10.680 --> 12:11.680]  Let's see.
[12:11.680 --> 12:12.680]  What do I do next?

[13:15.680 --> 13:17.680]  So, the Dank Team ad is done.
[13:17.680 --> 13:23.680]  Mike, you got anything you want to say before I get into this email that I've got here?
[13:24.680 --> 13:25.680]  Nope.
[13:25.680 --> 13:26.680]  Blank look on your face.
[13:26.680 --> 13:29.680]  Jeez, your fucking wheels just locked up.
[13:29.680 --> 13:33.680]  There's lots of stuff I could ramble at, but I want to see what we've got in the email bin.
[13:33.680 --> 13:35.680]  I'm kind of curious what you're going to ramble about.
[13:35.680 --> 13:37.680]  I can read emails any time.
[13:37.680 --> 13:42.680]  Just pick one, like as if it's a stack of emails and you're going to shuffle through.
[13:42.680 --> 13:44.680]  Just throw one of your topics at me.
[13:44.680 --> 13:45.680]  One thing.
[13:45.680 --> 13:49.680]  Okay, so today I saw this on five different anti-plot pages that I follow.
[13:49.680 --> 13:56.680]  There was another recall today in Colorado where some dispensary used some pesticide
[13:56.680 --> 14:01.680]  that isn't allowed in commercial use for cannabis in Colorado.
[14:01.680 --> 14:05.680]  When they sent their shit to be lab tested, it tested for that.
[14:05.680 --> 14:07.680]  It got recalled because of that.
[14:07.680 --> 14:14.680]  The way it works in Colorado is you can't send any of the harvest batch out before the lab test comes back.
[14:14.680 --> 14:21.680]  So, all of that product was still sitting on a shelf waiting to be sent to a retail location.
[14:21.680 --> 14:29.680]  The announcement was the system working, was legalization working, was a huge point of legalization being passed into law.
[14:29.680 --> 14:33.680]  Millions of people are already spending billions of dollars on marijuana.
[14:33.680 --> 14:38.680]  The least we can do is make sure they're buying a lab tested product and know what they're getting.
[14:38.680 --> 14:40.680]  And is the system working?
[14:40.680 --> 14:42.680]  And I see five different anti-pot pages like,
[14:42.680 --> 14:46.680]  Oh my God, it's not natural or safe. This is a marijuana fail.
[14:46.680 --> 14:53.680]  And then on the way over here, I see that, fucking, I want to say Safeway had their burritos recalled for listeria.
[14:53.680 --> 14:57.680]  And so when I get home tonight, I'm going to be like, Burrito fail, not safe or natural.
[14:57.680 --> 14:59.680]  Safeway is a dangerous corporation.
[14:59.680 --> 15:01.680]  No, I'm just kidding. Don't implement me in that shit.
[15:01.680 --> 15:05.680]  That was one of the five things that flashed through my head when you were like, what do you want to rant about?
[15:05.680 --> 15:07.680]  Yeah, no, it's a good thing that cannabis got caught.
[15:07.680 --> 15:13.680]  Now, I am pretty sure that only recreational cannabis is tested for pesticides. Is that accurate?
[15:13.680 --> 15:15.680]  At this point?
[15:15.680 --> 15:23.680]  It's the only, the requirements are for both, but the medical doesn't have to be submitted until January 1, I believe.
[15:23.680 --> 15:24.680]  Okay.
[15:24.680 --> 15:26.680]  We don't have any fucking labs.
[15:26.680 --> 15:28.680]  Yeah, that's a whole other story.
[15:28.680 --> 15:38.680]  If you don't know, the places that test the cantaloupe and the chicken wings aren't allowed to test the cannabis because of federal licensure.
[15:38.680 --> 15:46.680]  The first lab in Colorado that got set up to test cannabis applied for that license and got rated.
[15:46.680 --> 15:54.680]  So it's wonky. We're still building part of that system, but all rec is tested for pesticides.
[15:54.680 --> 16:01.680]  Yeah, all recreational cannabis. So if you're coming from another state and you're shopping at the recreational market, your product has been tested, which is weird.
[16:01.680 --> 16:03.680]  I think they would have done medical first.
[16:03.680 --> 16:13.680]  They wanted to, but medical was already up and running and had kind of built a stable system before they passed any of these rules.
[16:13.680 --> 16:21.680]  And then they were lobbied heavily by both the testing labs and the rec owners.
[16:22.680 --> 16:32.680]  The rec owners have a hard enough time getting their lab tests turned around in a reasonable amount of time, and they end up with products sitting in a storeroom when they want it sitting on a store shelf.
[16:32.680 --> 16:40.680]  And so they lobbied pretty heavily to not require medical submissions or turnaround until there were enough labs.
[16:40.680 --> 16:47.680]  Part of that's because in the years since this was done, it's been like two and a half years, several more labs have opened up.
[16:47.680 --> 16:48.680]  Of course we do.
[16:48.680 --> 16:50.680]  For a while there was fucking one lab in Durango that could do one of the tests.
[16:51.680 --> 16:53.680]  Yeah, and we do fucking send our shit to fucking Boulder.
[16:53.680 --> 16:55.680]  We're in Pueblo and we have a courier.
[16:55.680 --> 17:03.680]  A dude comes from Boulder and then drives all the way down to Pueblo, turns around five minutes after he gets there and drives all the way back to Boulder.
[17:03.680 --> 17:06.680]  It's like the shittiest drug deal you could ever imagine.
[17:06.680 --> 17:12.680]  I get one gram of everything please, and then I'm going to drive for three and a half hours home.
[17:12.680 --> 17:17.680]  Yeah, the fun part is just pulling a gram out of everything that we harvested.
[17:17.680 --> 17:23.680]  And then we sit around at the Grow just kind of one eye on our email waiting for Christmas to show up when we get our test results back.
[17:23.680 --> 17:25.680]  Yeah, we've had some pretty nice test results.
[17:25.680 --> 17:27.680]  Thirty-threes, thirty-twos.
[17:27.680 --> 17:29.680]  We had a bunch over thirty this last round.
[17:29.680 --> 17:30.680]  Yeah, we're doing all right.
[17:30.680 --> 17:31.680]  We're getting that Grow dialed in.
[17:31.680 --> 17:32.680]  So shout out to the whole crew out there.
[17:32.680 --> 17:35.680]  If you guys are listening, much love and respect to everybody that helps out in the garden out there.
[17:35.680 --> 17:37.680]  All the trimmers, everybody in the whole building.
[17:37.680 --> 17:38.680]  Appreciate everybody.
[17:38.680 --> 17:40.680]  Killing it lately.
[17:40.680 --> 17:41.680]  Thank you, boys.
[17:41.680 --> 17:44.680]  Well shit, Mike, you're here.
[17:44.680 --> 17:45.680]  What's the second thing on your mind?
[17:45.680 --> 17:47.680]  What grinds your gears?
[17:51.680 --> 17:52.680]  Oh God, I'm tired.
[17:53.680 --> 17:55.680]  There's so many different ways I go at this.
[17:55.680 --> 17:58.680]  How can you be tired with all the Mountain Dew you drink?
[17:58.680 --> 18:02.680]  The Mountain Dew I drink is the only reason I'm able to function at all.
[18:02.680 --> 18:07.680]  I don't know if you've seen how insane I am up front these days.
[18:07.680 --> 18:11.680]  And you add a two-year-old to that, it's a miracle.
[18:11.680 --> 18:14.680]  I'm fucking talking English right now, not just gibberish.
[18:15.680 --> 18:17.680]  What do you guys want to hear about?
[18:17.680 --> 18:24.680]  You want to hear about Maine's governor vetoing legalization that passed by fucking popular vote?
[18:24.680 --> 18:25.680]  So it passed.
[18:25.680 --> 18:26.680]  In the last election?
[18:26.680 --> 18:27.680]  And he just said, nuh-uh.
[18:27.680 --> 18:29.680]  It passed.
[18:29.680 --> 18:34.680]  The state legislature and Senate had to pass a rules and regulations package.
[18:34.680 --> 18:36.680]  And then the governor said no today.
[18:37.680 --> 18:50.680]  And in his statement about it, he specifies other states that have done this did so under an Obama administration that was pretty clear that they were going to be hands off.
[18:50.680 --> 18:55.680]  We don't have that anymore, so I ain't going to risk it, which is nonsense.
[18:55.680 --> 19:04.680]  Because if you remember, folks, this was the governor who went on national television, elected politician, in front of a camera that he invited.
[19:05.680 --> 19:13.680]  And he says, and this is a quote or as close as I can get to a quote, so I apologize for the heavy racial undertones and overtones.
[19:13.680 --> 19:25.680]  But this governor of Maine says, we don't want to pass a law and encourage D-money to come up here and impregnate white girls with luring them with drugs.
[19:25.680 --> 19:28.680]  That's what his fear of marijuana was, legalization.
[19:28.680 --> 19:32.680]  And he threw out a couple of names like D-money and I can't remember the other two.
[19:32.680 --> 19:33.680]  D-money is the one that stuck in my head.
[19:33.680 --> 19:34.680]  Slightly racist.
[19:34.680 --> 19:36.680]  Yeah, not even slightly.
[19:36.680 --> 19:37.680]  It's ridiculous.
[19:37.680 --> 19:43.680]  I don't know how he's still got his job after going on TV and saying that shit like six months, a year ago.
[19:43.680 --> 19:44.680]  But he did.
[19:44.680 --> 19:45.680]  Where did you say it is?
[19:45.680 --> 19:47.680]  The governor of Maine.
[19:47.680 --> 19:48.680]  See, Maine.
[19:48.680 --> 19:50.680]  That's how he still has his job.
[19:50.680 --> 19:51.680]  Yep.
[19:51.680 --> 19:54.680]  All nine people up there don't give a fuck.
[19:54.680 --> 19:58.680]  They're all freezing their dicks off and didn't want to go out and vote on shit.
[19:59.680 --> 20:02.680]  The lucky ones found a way to move fucking anywhere that doesn't suck.
[20:02.680 --> 20:04.680]  But yeah, sorry Maine.
[20:04.680 --> 20:08.680]  You're going to have to wait quite a while longer for legalization.
[20:08.680 --> 20:10.680]  I apologize if anybody heard that sniffle.
[20:10.680 --> 20:12.680]  We may have to press pause here in a second.
[20:12.680 --> 20:14.680]  I'm getting a pretty good sniffle set up going on.
[20:14.680 --> 20:16.680]  Unless you just want to talk for a few seconds.
[20:16.680 --> 20:17.680]  I don't know if they want me to do that.
[20:17.680 --> 20:20.680]  Let's hit pause and grab fresh drinks and shit, buddy.
[20:20.680 --> 20:21.680]  All right, guys, we're going to take a quick second.
[20:21.680 --> 20:22.680]  I got to blow my nose.
[20:22.680 --> 20:23.680]  We're going to grab a quick drink.
[20:23.680 --> 20:24.680]  We may take a dab.
[20:24.680 --> 20:25.680]  We'll be right back.
[20:25.680 --> 20:26.680]  Love and kisses.
[20:26.680 --> 20:27.680]  Peace.
[20:27.680 --> 20:28.680]  Oh, is that torch dying?
[20:28.680 --> 20:29.680]  Did it just die on you?
[20:29.680 --> 20:30.680]  Yeah.
[20:30.680 --> 20:31.680]  Here, dab it quick.
[20:31.680 --> 20:32.680]  I'll get it going.
[20:32.680 --> 20:33.680]  Don't worry.
[20:33.680 --> 20:34.680]  I can do this.
[20:38.140 --> 20:39.140]  How about fucking it's plenty hot.
[20:39.140 --> 20:40.140]  Oh, shit.
[20:41.140 --> 20:42.140]  Hot and hurty.
[20:42.140 --> 20:43.140]  Who needs an esophagus?
[20:44.140 --> 20:45.140]  Not you.
[20:48.140 --> 20:49.140]  Did you hit record before or after that?
[20:49.140 --> 20:50.140]  Oh, right before that.
[20:50.140 --> 20:52.140]  I took that right on the show.
[20:52.140 --> 20:53.140]  Oh my God.
[20:53.140 --> 20:56.140]  Because if you didn't, I'm talking to the microphone for no reason.
[20:57.140 --> 20:58.140]  Nice dab, buddy.
[20:58.140 --> 20:59.140]  Super hot dab.
[20:59.140 --> 21:00.140]  Holy shit.
[21:00.140 --> 21:01.140]  Thank you.
[21:01.140 --> 21:02.140]  You're welcome.
[21:02.140 --> 21:04.140]  Mike just gave me a dab of his bordello shatter.
[21:04.140 --> 21:06.140]  The whole fucking room smells so good right now.
[21:07.140 --> 21:08.140]  Oh, my brain smells funny.
[21:10.140 --> 21:11.140]  Oh God, it was too hot.
[21:11.140 --> 21:13.140]  It was more the heat cooking me than the high.
[21:13.140 --> 21:14.140]  Face tingles.
[21:15.140 --> 21:16.140]  Oh, lung tingles.
[21:16.140 --> 21:17.140]  Finger tingles.
[21:18.140 --> 21:19.140]  If it ain't burning and it ain't working.
[21:20.140 --> 21:21.140]  It's like questionable.
[21:21.140 --> 21:22.140]  Is this a stroke or an orgasm?
[21:22.140 --> 21:23.140]  Somewhere in the middle.
[21:25.140 --> 21:26.140]  Either way, don't stop.
[21:26.140 --> 21:27.140]  I like it.
[21:27.140 --> 21:28.140]  I like the face and the O-face.
[21:29.140 --> 21:30.140]  Equally hilarious.
[21:31.140 --> 21:32.140]  Oh, I'm glad you're laughing.
[21:32.140 --> 21:33.140]  Yep.
[21:34.140 --> 21:35.140]  It's fun to watch.
[21:35.140 --> 21:37.140]  Y'all getting to listen to me choke for like five minutes here in a second.
[21:37.140 --> 21:38.140]  So, don't feel bad for Jeff.
[21:39.140 --> 21:40.140]  Get fucking redemption.
[21:40.140 --> 21:41.140]  What do you want to dab, buddy?
[21:41.140 --> 21:42.140]  It might not be super, super hot.
[21:43.140 --> 21:44.140]  What are my options?
[21:44.140 --> 21:46.140]  Pretty much Chem IV or the Stardog.
[21:47.140 --> 21:48.140]  You know?
[21:49.140 --> 21:50.140]  Or bordello.
[21:50.140 --> 21:51.140]  I think I want a bordello dab.
[21:51.140 --> 21:52.140]  I want to second taste it.
[21:54.140 --> 21:55.140]  Toss me a pencil dabber.
[21:55.140 --> 21:56.140]  There's a pencil dabber?
[21:56.140 --> 21:57.140]  We're going to need some butane, sir.
[21:58.140 --> 21:59.140]  I've got butane.
[22:00.140 --> 22:01.140]  Listeners, we love you.
[22:02.140 --> 22:03.140]  You like it when we ramble.
[22:03.140 --> 22:05.140]  Do you like it when we get distracted and dab?
[22:06.140 --> 22:08.140]  There's, oh, there should be butane in there.
[22:08.140 --> 22:09.140]  If not, we'll figure something out.
[22:09.140 --> 22:10.140]  There's somebody on their way here.
[22:10.140 --> 22:12.140]  We'll make them acquire butane for us.
[22:12.140 --> 22:14.140]  In the meantime, we can use the e-nail.
[22:14.140 --> 22:16.140]  This torch may have taint, if nothing else.
[22:18.140 --> 22:19.140]  All right, we're getting it going, you guys.
[22:21.140 --> 22:24.140]  When the dabber's too sticky to get one dab, so you get four.
[22:24.140 --> 22:25.140]  Take all four of the dabs, Mike.
[22:25.140 --> 22:26.140]  I'm going to dab all four of them.
[22:27.140 --> 22:28.140]  Guys, welcome back to the podcast.
[22:28.140 --> 22:29.140]  I'm scared.
[22:29.140 --> 22:30.140]  We are here.
[22:30.140 --> 22:31.140]  We got hydrated.
[22:31.140 --> 22:32.140]  Mike got nicotine.
[22:32.140 --> 22:33.140]  I got TAC'd.
[22:33.140 --> 22:34.140]  I'm a little scared of the butane.
[22:34.140 --> 22:35.140]  I got caffeinated.
[22:35.140 --> 22:36.140]  We're doing just fine now.
[22:37.140 --> 22:38.140]  I got that crap out of my nose.
[22:39.140 --> 22:40.140]  Thanks for listening.
[22:40.140 --> 22:41.140]  Thanks for tolerating my head cold.
[22:42.140 --> 22:44.140]  Mike, thanks for coming over and helping me put together a podcast.
[22:45.140 --> 22:46.140]  Fuck yeah, bud.
[22:46.140 --> 22:47.140]  When I'm not doing 100% with my head cold here.
[22:48.140 --> 22:49.140]  It's a lot easier to ramble with two people.
[22:50.140 --> 22:51.140]  Got to give the peoples what they want.
[22:52.140 --> 22:53.140]  That hissing sound is Mike filling up a torch.
[22:53.140 --> 22:54.140]  I should have probably turned down his mic.
[22:55.140 --> 22:56.140]  I apologize.
[22:56.140 --> 22:57.140]  That's the tain.
[22:57.140 --> 22:58.140]  The tain brain.
[22:59.140 --> 23:00.140]  All right, so let's get into an email.
[23:01.140 --> 23:02.140]  We've been rambling a whole bunch.
[23:03.140 --> 23:04.140]  Email.
[23:05.140 --> 23:06.140]  Email.
[23:07.140 --> 23:08.140]  Email.
[23:08.140 --> 23:09.140]  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[23:09.140 --> 23:12.140]  All right, so this one comes from somebody who did not mention if they want their name said on the show.
[23:13.140 --> 23:14.140]  What up, Chris?
[23:15.140 --> 23:17.140]  Such a great fucking callback.
[23:18.140 --> 23:19.140]  Oh my God.
[23:20.140 --> 23:21.140]  That person probably doesn't listen.
[23:21.140 --> 23:22.140]  They probably hate us.
[23:23.140 --> 23:24.140]  Right.
[23:24.140 --> 23:25.140]  Delete it.
[23:25.140 --> 23:26.140]  All podcasts off their phone in spite.
[23:27.140 --> 23:28.140]  All right.
[23:29.140 --> 23:36.140]  Anyway, our listener sent an email and said, Rasta Jeff, I know you're a busy man, but could you point me in the direction of some short growing strains that the dank team provides?
[23:37.140 --> 23:41.140]  I've been viewing strains on their website, but they don't show height stats on any of the strains.
[23:42.140 --> 23:43.140]  There you go.
[23:43.140 --> 23:45.140]  All that sound you guys heard was Mike not being able to turn off the torch.
[23:46.140 --> 23:47.140]  That was the torch fucking with me.
[23:48.140 --> 23:49.140]  The torch is trolling me.
[23:49.140 --> 23:50.140]  It did it to me earlier.
[23:51.140 --> 23:52.140]  It would not shut off.
[23:52.140 --> 23:53.140]  It's becoming dangerous.
[23:54.140 --> 23:59.140]  Anyway, I've been doing strains on their website, but they don't show any height stats on any of the strains.
[24:00.140 --> 24:06.140]  Also, a lot of the strains are hard to find on other websites, so I can't cross reference many of them to find this out.
[24:08.140 --> 24:10.140]  Oh, I tried to get through it without choking.
[24:10.140 --> 24:11.140]  Those dabs we took had me choking.
[24:12.140 --> 24:13.140]  Let's see.
[24:13.140 --> 24:20.140]  This listener wants me to give them information on short growing strains available at the dank team.
[24:21.140 --> 24:22.140]  So I did a little bit of research.
[24:23.140 --> 24:25.140]  They do have some iRegenetics available.
[24:27.140 --> 24:28.140]  Short growing.
[24:28.140 --> 24:30.140]  Now, I'm not sure Mike's dying over there.
[24:30.140 --> 24:31.140]  Should I leave the mic on or not?
[24:32.140 --> 24:33.140]  We'll turn it down so that you can hear him.
[24:34.140 --> 24:35.140]  Wow, he turned purple, then pale.
[24:35.140 --> 24:36.140]  A little bit of sweat.
[24:37.140 --> 24:39.140]  I think Mike is kind of like my Lee Syatt, you guys.
[24:40.140 --> 24:41.140]  It's fun watching him change colors.
[24:41.140 --> 24:43.140]  Mike, give me a thumbs up when you're alive, and we'll put your mic back on.
[24:44.140 --> 24:45.140]  I'm alive. Don't turn it on.
[24:46.140 --> 24:47.140]  I'm alive. Don't turn it on.
[24:48.140 --> 24:53.140]  All right. Now, I'm not sure if you mean short growing strains by height-wise or time-wise.
[24:54.140 --> 24:57.140]  I'm not certain what you mean by short growing strains.
[24:58.140 --> 25:04.140]  When I read the question the first time, I interpreted it, interpreted the question as height.
[25:05.140 --> 25:08.140]  Now that I'm rereading it on the show, I'm wondering if you meant time.
[25:08.140 --> 25:12.140]  Yeah, do you mean like some eight-week plants, some seven-week plants, some nine, maybe?
[25:13.140 --> 25:15.140]  Yeah. Or do you mean not as tall?
[25:16.140 --> 25:17.140]  Because I may need to redo my research.
[25:18.140 --> 25:19.140]  But let's talk about...
[25:20.140 --> 25:21.140]  I'm coming back, folks.
[25:22.140 --> 25:23.140]  Yeah, I'm putting your mic back on.
[25:24.140 --> 25:25.140]  I just reached over to do that.
[25:26.140 --> 25:27.140]  There you go. Mike's back, you guys.
[25:28.140 --> 25:29.140]  I'm tagging him back in.
[25:30.140 --> 25:31.140]  It makes my mic sound better, too.
[25:32.140 --> 25:33.140]  I get a little echo off that one.
[25:34.140 --> 25:35.140]  He lied. He's not back in.
[25:36.140 --> 25:37.140]  I'm back-ish.
[25:38.140 --> 25:39.140]  Here's something that fits both categories.
[25:40.140 --> 25:41.140]  Cookie stomper.
[25:42.140 --> 25:44.140]  Some of the cookie stomper phenotypes are done in like eight-ish weeks.
[25:45.140 --> 25:46.140]  56 days, maybe 60 days.
[25:47.140 --> 25:48.140]  And also, they don't get too tall.
[25:49.140 --> 25:51.140]  So cookie stomper fits both of those categories.
[25:52.140 --> 25:53.140]  Another one, prana.
[25:54.140 --> 25:56.140]  Prana is across a flow and a rise.
[25:57.140 --> 25:59.140]  Prana makes very unique smelling plants.
[26:00.140 --> 26:01.140]  They smell amazing.
[26:02.140 --> 26:03.140]  And some of them are done at like 55.
[26:04.140 --> 26:05.140]  Some are done at 60.
[26:06.140 --> 26:07.140]  Some are done at 63 days.
[26:08.140 --> 26:09.140]  Mike, you all right, bro?
[26:10.140 --> 26:11.140]  That tab's taking me places.
[26:12.140 --> 26:13.140]  I can see it. You weren't there for a moment.
[26:14.140 --> 26:15.140]  No, I went somewhere else. It was fun.
[26:16.140 --> 26:17.140]  You guys, I wish I had video of this.
[26:18.140 --> 26:19.140]  It had snacks.
[26:20.140 --> 26:21.140]  That's better than here. We don't have any snacks right now.
[26:22.140 --> 26:23.140]  Where was I? Did I say cookie stomper?
[26:24.140 --> 26:25.140]  I said prana. Did I say the flow stomper?
[26:26.140 --> 26:27.140]  Flow stomper would be good for you.
[26:28.140 --> 26:29.140]  It doesn't take too long to flower and stays short.
[26:30.140 --> 26:31.140]  Another one that you will love,
[26:32.140 --> 26:33.140]  that everybody will love,
[26:34.140 --> 26:35.140]  the morning dew.
[26:36.140 --> 26:37.140]  Morning dew is a grateful dog,
[26:38.140 --> 26:39.140]  which is one of my favorites.
[26:40.140 --> 26:41.140]  Cross to a rise,
[26:42.140 --> 26:43.140]  which is another one of a lot of people's favorites.
[26:44.140 --> 26:45.140]  Those are two of my favorite strains.
[26:46.140 --> 26:47.140]  I bred both of them.
[26:48.140 --> 26:49.140]  I crossed them together.
[26:50.140 --> 26:51.140]  I call it morning dew.
[26:52.140 --> 26:53.140]  It doesn't get too tall.
[26:54.140 --> 26:55.140]  There are some very Cush dominant phenotypes in there
[26:56.140 --> 26:57.140]  that will give you some big, fat, beefy Cush.
[26:58.140 --> 26:59.140]  There's some Chem D in there.
[27:00.140 --> 27:01.140]  There's Joseph O.G.
[27:02.140 --> 27:03.140]  There's a lot of great stuff in that cross.
[27:04.140 --> 27:05.140]  There's San Fernando Valley O.G. Cush.
[27:06.140 --> 27:07.140]  There's Chem 91.
[27:08.140 --> 27:09.140]  There's a lot of short, but buddy plants
[27:10.140 --> 27:11.140]  if you find the right phenotypes.
[27:12.140 --> 27:13.140]  That's stuff from iReed Genetics.
[27:14.140 --> 27:15.140]  Let's talk about stuff from other breeders.
[27:16.140 --> 27:17.140]  Mike, it looked like you had an idea.
[27:18.140 --> 27:20.140]  If you're talking height or timeline,
[27:21.140 --> 27:22.140]  if you're talking height and you're really restricted,
[27:23.140 --> 27:24.140]  shoot us an email with some specifications
[27:25.140 --> 27:26.140]  of your grow area.
[27:27.140 --> 27:28.140]  I know Jeff can come up with three or four ideas
[27:29.140 --> 27:30.140]  to help you out.
[27:31.140 --> 27:32.140]  Guaranteed on that. Guaranteed.
[27:33.140 --> 27:34.140]  Lungs are still fluttering.
[27:35.140 --> 27:36.140]  I can see it on you.
[27:36.140 --> 27:37.140]  We can hear it a little bit in you.
[27:38.140 --> 27:39.140]  I'm going to turn it up just a touch.
[27:40.140 --> 27:41.140]  You're good, man.
[27:42.140 --> 27:43.140]  You took a big old dab.
[27:44.140 --> 27:45.140]  You took four of your size dabs,
[27:46.140 --> 27:47.140]  which is one dab for a normal girl.
[27:48.140 --> 27:49.140]  Anyway, another strain that I could recommend.
[27:50.140 --> 27:51.140]  It's no dab competition.
[27:52.140 --> 27:53.140]  I'm just fucking with you.
[27:54.140 --> 27:55.140]  Another strain I could recommend
[27:56.140 --> 27:57.140]  that is not from iReed Genetics,
[27:58.140 --> 27:59.140]  but is available at thedankteam.com.
[28:00.140 --> 28:01.140]  It's from our friends at La Plata Labs.
[28:02.140 --> 28:03.140]  I would recommend the Durango O.G.
[28:04.140 --> 28:05.140]  It's got phenotypes that finish in eight weeks.
[28:06.140 --> 28:07.140]  If you grow from seed,
[28:08.140 --> 28:09.140]  you're going to find some phenotypes
[28:10.140 --> 28:11.140]  that finish earlier, some that finish later.
[28:12.140 --> 28:13.140]  Grow from seed, get that earlier finishing one
[28:14.140 --> 28:15.140]  that works best for you.
[28:16.140 --> 28:17.140]  Finish it up that way.
[28:18.140 --> 28:19.140]  Fucking you've got what you need.
[28:20.140 --> 28:21.140]  The Durango O.G. will have eight-week phenotypes in there.
[28:22.140 --> 28:23.140]  Here's another strain that I don't hype a lot
[28:24.140 --> 28:25.140]  because it gets enough fucking hype on its own.
[28:26.140 --> 28:27.140]  Tangi.
[28:28.140 --> 28:29.140]  Tangi from Crockett Family Farms.
[28:30.140 --> 28:31.140]  If you grow it up to be about,
[28:32.140 --> 28:33.140]  I don't know how high your tight restrictions are,
[28:34.140 --> 28:35.140]  but it's not one of those strains that stretch.
[28:36.140 --> 28:37.140]  They do what we like to call the 21-day stretch.
[28:38.140 --> 28:39.140]  For the first three weeks of flower,
[28:40.140 --> 28:41.140]  they really like to take the fuck off.
[28:42.140 --> 28:43.140]  Just the scabs.
[28:44.140 --> 28:45.140]  That's what I like to call it.
[28:46.140 --> 28:47.140]  They like to just start taking off.
[28:48.140 --> 28:49.140]  Tangi doesn't seem to do it as badly
[28:50.140 --> 28:51.140]  as a lot of other plants.
[28:52.140 --> 28:53.140]  Tangi kind of doesn't do that stretch.
[28:54.140 --> 28:55.140]  Some of them just race for those lights.
[28:56.140 --> 28:57.140]  Yeah, Tangi stays sort of low for you.
[28:58.140 --> 28:59.140]  So Tangi crosses, Strawberry Banana Tangi,
[29:00.140 --> 29:01.140]  the Taffy, stuff like that,
[29:02.140 --> 29:03.140]  which is Tangi and Affy,
[29:04.140 --> 29:05.140]  stuff like that will stay kind of short for you.
[29:06.140 --> 29:07.140]  They don't take a real long time to finish.
[29:08.140 --> 29:09.140]  So that fits both of your timelines.
[29:10.140 --> 29:11.140]  That should be enough recommendations for you.
[29:12.140 --> 29:13.140]  Mike, I'll put your mic back on.
[29:14.140 --> 29:15.140]  You look like you're back on the planet.
[29:16.140 --> 29:17.140]  I'm mostly good to go.
[29:18.140 --> 29:19.140]  You're on animal planet again.
[29:20.140 --> 29:21.140]  Baked like a cake, but good to go.
[29:22.140 --> 29:23.140]  Baked like a cake.
[29:24.140 --> 29:25.140]  So those are some strains that are available.
[29:26.140 --> 29:27.140]  There's a lot of stuff available
[29:28.140 --> 29:29.140]  from the Cali Connection.
[29:30.140 --> 29:31.140]  You'll find some eight or nine week phenotypes
[29:32.140 --> 29:33.140]  that stays fairly short because they're Cush dominant.
[29:34.140 --> 29:35.140]  I'm not exactly sure what you meant,
[29:36.140 --> 29:37.140]  but I'm not sure what you meant
[29:38.140 --> 29:39.140]  because short growing has me confused.
[29:40.140 --> 29:41.140]  At first I thought one thing,
[29:42.140 --> 29:43.140]  and I read it again, and I thought another thing.
[29:44.140 --> 29:45.140]  So let me know what you think.
[29:46.140 --> 29:47.140]  Randomly, I want to give a huge shout out
[29:48.140 --> 29:49.140]  to my friends, the Lacewings.
[29:50.140 --> 29:51.140]  That's right.
[29:52.140 --> 29:53.140]  I just saw one fly by.
[29:54.140 --> 29:55.140]  I released Lacewings in a Garden recently,
[29:56.140 --> 29:57.140]  and I just saw a Lacewing fly by here
[29:58.140 --> 29:59.140]  because, yeah, they followed me.
[30:00.140 --> 30:01.140]  They followed me.
[30:02.140 --> 30:03.140]  Let's see.
[30:04.140 --> 30:05.140]  To our friend that sent this email,
[30:06.140 --> 30:07.140]  I have no restrictions.
[30:08.140 --> 30:09.140]  Thanks for the email.
[30:10.140 --> 30:11.140]  Let me know how I can guide you more carefully.
[30:12.140 --> 30:13.140]  I gave you a few strain recommendations.
[30:14.140 --> 30:15.140]  I would like to get more specific
[30:16.140 --> 30:17.140]  and answer your question more specifically.
[30:18.140 --> 30:19.140]  Mike, you got any insight on that one?
[30:20.140 --> 30:22.140]  No, just let us know which one you meant,
[30:23.140 --> 30:24.140]  and we can get you a better list
[30:25.140 --> 30:26.140]  of quick flowering strains
[30:27.140 --> 30:28.140]  or a better list of short strains,
[30:29.140 --> 30:30.140]  or we can give you some specific grow tips
[30:31.140 --> 30:32.140]  to work with your space.
[30:33.140 --> 30:34.140]  Absolutely.
[30:34.140 --> 30:35.140]  You can trellis down most plants.
[30:36.140 --> 30:37.140]  Put a little 4x4 or 5x5 trellis net up,
[30:38.140 --> 30:39.140]  like just the square net.
[30:40.140 --> 30:41.140]  I've seen so many different methods.
[30:42.140 --> 30:43.140]  Yeah, yeah.
[30:44.140 --> 30:45.140]  Just let the plant grow into that,
[30:46.140 --> 30:47.140]  and then when it starts,
[30:48.140 --> 30:49.140]  it'll grow up into it,
[30:50.140 --> 30:51.140]  and then just bend it down and keep it,
[30:52.140 --> 30:53.140]  weave it into that, basically,
[30:54.140 --> 30:55.140]  is what you're doing to keep it low.
[30:56.140 --> 30:57.140]  Don't let it go up.
[30:58.140 --> 30:59.140]  Let it go out and spread it out.
[31:00.140 --> 31:01.140]  One plant, 5x5.
[31:02.140 --> 31:03.140]  I watched a guy every morning.
[31:04.140 --> 31:05.140]  He had a bunch of plants left.
[31:06.140 --> 31:07.140]  Yep.
[31:08.140 --> 31:09.140]  Come October, it was just one long vine
[31:10.140 --> 31:11.140]  that went halfway down his fence
[31:12.140 --> 31:13.140]  with little Christmas tree buds
[31:14.140 --> 31:15.140]  coming off at every three inches.
[31:16.140 --> 31:17.140]  Yeah, a big pine cone or a large pine cone
[31:18.140 --> 31:19.140]  sticking off at each little spot.
[31:20.140 --> 31:21.140]  Yep.
[31:21.140 --> 31:22.140]  Instead of one giant glory bud
[31:23.140 --> 31:24.140]  sticking up and touching the light,
[31:25.140 --> 31:26.140]  you get a whole room,
[31:27.140 --> 31:28.140]  a whole 5x5 section of just beautiful little buds,
[31:29.140 --> 31:30.140]  little seven-grammers everywhere.
[31:31.140 --> 31:32.140]  Yep.
[31:32.140 --> 31:33.140]  Nice setup.
[31:34.140 --> 31:35.140]  Let's see.
[31:36.140 --> 31:37.140]  Since we're talking about seeds,
[31:38.140 --> 31:39.140]  here's another question about seeds.
[31:40.140 --> 31:41.140]  He says,
[31:42.140 --> 31:43.140]  Hey, Jeff, I've emailed before from Alaska
[31:44.140 --> 31:45.140]  about an auto flower,
[31:46.140 --> 31:47.140]  and you hooked me up with the answer.
[31:48.140 --> 31:49.140]  Now I'm hoping for a two-for-two.
[31:50.140 --> 31:51.140]  It's been a little while since you sent this.
[31:52.140 --> 31:53.140]  I'm sorry, I've got a ton of fucking emails,
[31:54.140 --> 31:55.140]  but here you are.
[31:56.140 --> 31:57.140]  I hope you're still listening.
[31:58.140 --> 31:59.140]  Big shout-out.
[32:00.140 --> 32:01.140]  He continues to say,
[32:02.140 --> 32:03.140]  I'm interested in your seeds
[32:04.140 --> 32:05.140]  and deepwater culture and hydroponics,
[32:06.140 --> 32:07.140]  so I'll go ahead and admit
[32:08.140 --> 32:09.140]  that I don't have a lot of experience
[32:10.140 --> 32:11.140]  with that type of grow situation,
[32:12.140 --> 32:13.140]  but I do have a lot of experience
[32:14.140 --> 32:15.140]  with strains that are good producers
[32:16.140 --> 32:17.140]  and good flavor.
[32:18.140 --> 32:19.140]  Good producers.
[32:20.140 --> 32:21.140]  Anything crossed to the white widow.
[32:22.140 --> 32:23.140]  So...
[32:24.140 --> 32:25.140]  Widow gets nuggy.
[32:26.140 --> 32:27.140]  The look on your face, widow gets nuggy.
[32:28.140 --> 32:29.140]  Mike's still high from the dab.
[32:30.140 --> 32:31.140]  There's a white widow plant
[32:32.140 --> 32:33.140]  that my father-in-law of all people grew
[32:34.140 --> 32:35.140]  and I'm like,
[32:36.140 --> 32:37.140]  I'm a white widow.
[32:38.140 --> 32:39.140]  I'm immediately flashback to that summer,
[32:40.140 --> 32:41.140]  harvesting her.
[32:42.140 --> 32:43.140]  It was just monumental.
[32:44.140 --> 32:45.140]  The storm shadow cross
[32:46.140 --> 32:47.140]  is what I'm talking about from iRegenetics.
[32:48.140 --> 32:49.140]  iRegenetics puts out huge,
[32:50.140 --> 32:51.140]  or the storm shadow puts out huge colas.
[32:52.140 --> 32:53.140]  Tastes really, really amazing,
[32:54.140 --> 32:55.140]  kind of unique.
[32:56.140 --> 32:57.140]  That's a good one.
[32:58.140 --> 32:59.140]  So I would go for the storm shadow.
[33:00.140 --> 33:01.140]  That's white widow to arise.
[33:02.140 --> 33:03.140]  Also, there's the cream.
[33:04.140 --> 33:06.920]  I'm curious what the look on your face means.
[33:07.920 --> 33:08.920]  I'm sitting here trying to think of strains
[33:09.920 --> 33:10.920]  and my list is very different than yours
[33:11.920 --> 33:12.920]  because it's generated from different places
[33:13.920 --> 33:14.920]  and a totally different knowledge base.
[33:15.920 --> 33:16.920]  And then I chuckled
[33:17.920 --> 33:19.920]  because of our friend 44 in Blue Dream.
[33:20.920 --> 33:21.920]  That's sort of what people love about it.
[33:22.920 --> 33:23.920]  It's got a smell and a flavor profile
[33:24.920 --> 33:25.920]  that most people find pleasant
[33:26.920 --> 33:27.920]  and it harvests like a motherfucker.
[33:29.920 --> 33:30.920]  Another strain of mine that's available,
[33:31.920 --> 33:32.920]  you can either get it at the Dank Team
[33:33.920 --> 33:34.920]  or at the Danker Team.
[33:35.920 --> 33:36.920]  If it's not available at the Dank Team,
[33:37.920 --> 33:38.920]  available, did I stutter on available?
[33:39.920 --> 33:40.920]  Another strain,
[33:41.920 --> 33:42.920]  you can get it at the, what's it called?
[33:43.920 --> 33:44.920]  Dankseed.co
[33:45.920 --> 33:47.920]  or just Google the Hella Dank Seed Company
[33:48.920 --> 33:49.920]  and you'll be able to find it.
[33:50.920 --> 33:51.920]  But something I recommend is called Scarlet Begonias.
[33:52.920 --> 33:53.920]  It's redheaded stranger to arise
[33:54.920 --> 33:55.920]  and it will produce huge crops
[33:56.920 --> 33:57.920]  and it will smell amazing.
[33:58.920 --> 33:59.920]  So there's a few recommendations for you.
[34:00.920 --> 34:01.920]  I hope you find something you like in that mix.
[34:02.920 --> 34:03.920]  There are two options to find seeds.
[34:03.920 --> 34:04.920]  The Dank Team.com
[34:05.920 --> 34:06.920]  and the Hella Dank Seed Co.
[34:07.920 --> 34:08.920]  Just Google the Dank Team Seeds
[34:09.920 --> 34:10.920]  or the Hella Dank Seed Co.
[34:11.920 --> 34:12.920]  and one of them will pop up.
[34:13.920 --> 34:14.920]  You'll be able to find what you need.
[34:15.920 --> 34:16.920]  They're on opposite coasts.
[34:17.920 --> 34:18.920]  So if you live on one coast,
[34:19.920 --> 34:20.920]  maybe that'll help you out with shipping.
[34:21.920 --> 34:22.920]  They've both got different deals.
[34:23.920 --> 34:24.920]  They've both got different giveaways.
[34:25.920 --> 34:26.920]  Check out their websites.
[34:27.920 --> 34:28.920]  You decide where to shop.
[34:29.920 --> 34:30.920]  I endorse them both.
[34:31.920 --> 34:32.920]  I want to give a big shout out
[34:33.920 --> 34:34.920]  to my friend,
[34:35.920 --> 34:36.920]  but you know who you are
[34:37.920 --> 34:38.920]  because you wrote this email to me in May
[34:39.920 --> 34:40.920]  and I'm just now reading it to you.
[34:41.920 --> 34:42.920]  I apologize.
[34:43.920 --> 34:44.920]  When my phone updated,
[34:45.920 --> 34:46.920]  it wiped out all my emails off my phone
[34:47.920 --> 34:48.920]  and I had to go download apps
[34:49.920 --> 34:50.920]  for each individual email address.
[34:51.920 --> 34:52.920]  Yeah, well, no.
[34:53.920 --> 34:54.920]  Then when I reloaded it on the app,
[34:55.920 --> 34:56.920]  it brought up so many fucking emails.
[34:57.920 --> 34:58.920]  I was like, I never even saw that.
[34:59.920 --> 35:00.920]  So I printed them off.
[35:01.920 --> 35:02.920]  I wasted like seven trees.
[35:03.920 --> 35:04.920]  I apologize, but hey, I read it.
[35:05.920 --> 35:06.920]  I did it.
[35:07.920 --> 35:08.920]  I'm going to catch up.
[35:09.920 --> 35:10.920]  There's so many emails.
[35:11.920 --> 35:12.920]  All right, Mike, you got anything
[35:13.920 --> 35:14.920]  you want to add to the good producer
[35:15.920 --> 35:16.920]  and good flavor from iRegeneticSeeds?
[35:17.920 --> 35:18.920]  Nope.
[35:19.920 --> 35:20.920]  Yeah, I didn't think you'd have any better insight
[35:21.920 --> 35:22.920]  than what I've got available.
[35:23.920 --> 35:24.920]  Nope.
[35:24.920 --> 35:25.920]  I didn't even hear the iRegeneticSeeds part.
[35:26.920 --> 35:27.920]  Yeah, they want something for my line.
[35:28.920 --> 35:29.920]  That's funny.
[35:30.920 --> 35:31.920]  So I would say the Storm Shadow
[35:31.920 --> 35:32.920]  and all their stuff that will be
[35:33.920 --> 35:34.920]  a lot harder to find than those
[35:35.920 --> 35:36.920]  that meets that definition.
[35:37.920 --> 35:38.920]  Dude, if you can get the Storm Shadow,
[35:39.920 --> 35:40.920]  fucking dive on it.
[35:41.920 --> 35:42.920]  Bounty Killer.
[35:43.920 --> 35:44.920]  The Bounty Killer is what I was thinking
[35:45.920 --> 35:46.920]  of specifically.
[35:47.920 --> 35:48.920]  I don't know where that's available.
[35:49.920 --> 35:50.920]  You can find Bounty Killer seeds.
[35:51.920 --> 35:52.920]  Go get those if you want to be a producer.
[35:53.920 --> 35:54.920]  It was like your standard movie theater
[35:55.920 --> 35:56.920]  straw with a two-liter bottle on it
[35:57.920 --> 35:58.920]  is how that plant built out.
[35:59.920 --> 36:00.920]  It was just fucking retarded.
[36:01.920 --> 36:02.920]  I wish you luck.
[36:03.920 --> 36:04.920]  It looks long.
[36:05.920 --> 36:06.920]  It is kind of long, but it's quick
[36:07.920 --> 36:08.920]  and to the point for being so long.
[36:09.920 --> 36:10.920]  This guy says,
[36:11.920 --> 36:12.920]  Hey, Rasta Jeff, you don't know me,
[36:13.920 --> 36:14.920]  but I know you.
[36:15.920 --> 36:16.920]  My name is...
[36:17.920 --> 36:18.920]  and his name is not Slim Shady,
[36:19.920 --> 36:20.920]  but I don't know if I should say his name.
[36:21.920 --> 36:22.920]  He says, my name is...
[36:23.920 --> 36:24.920]  You don't know me,
[36:25.920 --> 36:26.920]  but I watch you throw your trash
[36:27.920 --> 36:28.920]  out every Wednesday.
[36:29.920 --> 36:30.920]  His initials are ZD,
[36:31.920 --> 36:32.920]  but he says,
[36:33.920 --> 36:34.920]  I've been listening to your podcast.
[36:35.920 --> 36:36.920]  I've been listening for a few months,
[36:37.920 --> 36:38.920]  just keeping up with the most current one posted.
[36:39.920 --> 36:40.920]  Recently, your podcast has recently
[36:41.920 --> 36:42.920]  started to click with me.
[36:43.920 --> 36:44.920]  One of your latest GFYH podcasts,
[36:45.920 --> 36:46.920]  you had set out a correctly used weed terminology
[36:47.920 --> 36:48.920]  like the phrase dabs instead of dab
[36:49.920 --> 36:50.920]  when you talk about doing dabs.
[36:51.920 --> 36:52.920]  I thought you brought up a good point
[36:53.920 --> 36:54.920]  and it really seemed like a move
[36:55.920 --> 36:56.920]  I would do also in trying to help out
[36:57.920 --> 36:58.920]  my weed-smoking brothers.
[36:59.920 --> 37:00.920]  Now I feel more like your brother to me
[37:01.920 --> 37:02.920]  so keep up the good work, brother,
[37:03.920 --> 37:04.920]  and let's work together to educate each other
[37:05.920 --> 37:07.920]  about what we are truly passionate about.
[37:08.920 --> 37:09.920]  There's more to the email,
[37:10.920 --> 37:11.920]  but I want to say I like these emails
[37:12.920 --> 37:13.920]  when people tell me that they feel like
[37:14.920 --> 37:15.920]  they're my friend because this may sound weird,
[37:16.920 --> 37:17.920]  but I'm not only a podcaster,
[37:18.920 --> 37:19.920]  but I listen to podcasts as well.
[37:20.920 --> 37:21.920]  I'm also a member.
[37:22.920 --> 37:23.920]  I listen to a lot of podcasts
[37:24.920 --> 37:25.920]  and I listen to the podcast hosted by comedians.
[37:26.920 --> 37:27.920]  I don't listen to a lot of cannabis podcasts
[37:28.920 --> 37:29.920]  because the reason I don't listen
[37:29.920 --> 37:30.920]  to a lot of cannabis podcasts
[37:31.920 --> 37:32.920]  is because I don't want to bite their style.
[37:33.920 --> 37:34.920]  I don't want to accidentally steal their voice.
[37:35.920 --> 37:36.920]  I don't want to contaminate my flow with...
[37:37.920 --> 37:38.920]  Yes, exactly.
[37:39.920 --> 37:40.920]  I don't want to become other people
[37:41.920 --> 37:42.920]  so I try to keep my...
[37:43.920 --> 37:44.920]  Oh, God.
[37:45.920 --> 37:46.920]  Shout out to our friends at the Dude Grows podcast.
[37:47.920 --> 37:48.920]  Our friends at the DGC, the Dude Grows crew.
[37:49.920 --> 37:50.920]  Great people, great podcast.
[37:51.920 --> 37:52.920]  If you're not listening to the Dude Grows podcast,
[37:53.920 --> 37:54.920]  just Google Dude Grows Show and listen.
[37:55.920 --> 37:56.920]  You'll love it.
[37:57.920 --> 37:58.920]  This is some of my favorite music.
[37:59.920 --> 38:00.920]  Dude Grows Show is available there.
[38:01.920 --> 38:02.920]  Please message them and be like,
[38:03.920 --> 38:04.920]  hey, Ross and Jeff gave you a shout out
[38:05.920 --> 38:06.920]  and we're going to listen to your show.
[38:07.920 --> 38:08.920]  Ross says, what up?
[38:09.920 --> 38:10.920]  I don't see a competition.
[38:11.920 --> 38:12.920]  They put out an episode every fucking day.
[38:13.920 --> 38:14.920]  If you've got time to listen to all their stuff,
[38:15.920 --> 38:16.920]  listen, please do.
[38:17.920 --> 38:18.920]  I don't have time to put out that much content.
[38:19.920 --> 38:20.920]  I was listening to an episode of theirs the other day
[38:21.920 --> 38:22.920]  and they were like, just hit 500,000.
[38:23.920 --> 38:24.920]  No biggie, coming at it.
[38:25.920 --> 38:26.920]  I'm like, fuck, dude, 500?
[38:27.920 --> 38:28.920]  If you guys could cover my monthly salary
[38:29.920 --> 38:30.920]  and I just know if my listeners
[38:31.920 --> 38:32.920]  would cover what I make monthly,
[38:33.920 --> 38:34.920]  however I make on a good month,
[38:35.920 --> 38:36.920]  with a little bit of overtime
[38:37.920 --> 38:38.920]  and maybe a small bonus,
[38:39.920 --> 38:40.920]  just pay me what I expect to make in a month,
[38:41.920 --> 38:42.920]  which I know what I bring in.
[38:43.920 --> 38:44.920]  If the podcast listeners could put that together.
[38:45.920 --> 38:46.920]  I'm not asking you guys to do this.
[38:47.920 --> 38:48.920]  This is just hypothetical.
[38:49.920 --> 38:50.920]  This would be the dream.
[38:51.920 --> 38:52.920]  I would put out four episodes a week of new content
[38:53.920 --> 38:54.920]  and then every Thursday I would still do
[38:55.920 --> 38:56.920]  a throwback Thursday.
[38:57.920 --> 38:58.920]  I'd do Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday
[38:59.920 --> 39:00.920]  and then Friday.
[39:01.920 --> 39:02.920]  Podcasts on a Friday seems weird.
[39:03.920 --> 39:04.920]  I don't think anybody would even fucking listen
[39:05.920 --> 39:06.920]  to a Friday podcast.
[39:07.920 --> 39:08.920]  If you put out a show on a Friday,
[39:09.920 --> 39:10.920]  everyone's out partying,
[39:11.920 --> 39:12.920]  everyone's out doing their thing,
[39:13.920 --> 39:14.920]  nobody's listening to a podcast.
[39:15.920 --> 39:16.920]  Road tripping.
[39:17.920 --> 39:18.920]  Road tripping, okay, maybe, maybe.
[39:19.920 --> 39:20.920]  And then maybe a Sunday show,
[39:21.920 --> 39:22.920]  you know what I mean?
[39:23.920 --> 39:24.920]  But I'd put out at least four fresh episodes
[39:25.920 --> 39:26.920]  and a throwback Thursday episode
[39:27.920 --> 39:28.920]  and I would also do a lot of YouTube stuff.
[39:29.920 --> 39:30.920]  I'm trying to plug Patreon.
[39:31.920 --> 39:32.920]  Well, I guess we'll do it.
[39:33.920 --> 39:34.920]  Patreon, since we're in the middle of an email,
[39:35.920 --> 39:36.920]  Patreon is a service that allows my listeners
[39:37.920 --> 39:38.920]  to contribute to the podcast financially.
[39:39.920 --> 39:40.920]  Just a minute ago Mike told me
[39:41.920 --> 39:42.920]  that his microphone cover smelled like
[39:43.920 --> 39:44.920]  he'd been spitting in it for too long.
[39:45.920 --> 39:46.920]  No, I said this one smelled like one
[39:47.920 --> 39:48.920]  that hadn't been spit in it.
[39:49.920 --> 39:50.920]  Yeah, that's kind of a freshy one.
[39:51.920 --> 39:52.920]  It smells like shoe polish or something, doesn't it?
[39:53.920 --> 39:54.920]  No, it just smells like synthetic fabric
[39:55.920 --> 39:56.920]  microphone cover.
[39:57.920 --> 39:58.920]  I got these black microphone covers
[39:59.920 --> 40:00.920]  from sitting out for a while
[40:01.920 --> 40:02.920]  because the odor was really strong.
[40:03.920 --> 40:04.920]  But anyway, Patreon, you can contribute
[40:05.920 --> 40:06.920]  to the podcast by going to
[40:07.920 --> 40:08.920]  patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[40:09.920 --> 40:10.920]  Patreon will allow you as a listener
[40:11.920 --> 40:12.920]  to financially contribute to the podcast.
[40:13.920 --> 40:14.920]  What I will do with your contributions
[40:15.920 --> 40:16.920]  is pay for my website,
[40:17.920 --> 40:18.920]  iRegioneticsColorado.com,
[40:19.920 --> 40:20.920]  which is where I host the show,
[40:21.920 --> 40:22.920]  which allows you as a listener
[40:23.920 --> 40:24.920]  to listen to the show for free.
[40:25.920 --> 40:26.920]  There are a few people out there
[40:27.920 --> 40:28.920]  that would like to contribute.
[40:29.920 --> 40:30.920]  They don't start to smell like sausage
[40:31.920 --> 40:32.920]  and bad breath so that when other people
[40:33.920 --> 40:34.920]  come over to be on the show...
[40:35.920 --> 40:36.920]  They get ragged after like 30 shows.
[40:37.920 --> 40:38.920]  Yeah, well, I don't even know.
[40:39.920 --> 40:40.920]  I won't let them go that long.
[40:41.920 --> 40:42.920]  That's just bad hygiene.
[40:43.920 --> 40:44.920]  Dude, I remember the orange one
[40:45.920 --> 40:46.920]  was here for like the first 50.
[40:47.920 --> 40:48.920]  That was a certain person's mic
[40:49.920 --> 40:50.920]  and he had a funky mustache
[40:51.920 --> 40:52.920]  and he used to always rub his mustache
[40:53.920 --> 40:54.920]  onto it and it just funked it up real bad.
[40:55.920 --> 40:56.920]  And I also buy a bottle of water
[40:57.920 --> 40:58.920]  and stuff like that.
[40:59.920 --> 41:00.920]  So if you're a listener,
[41:01.920 --> 41:02.920]  if you're a listener from your heart,
[41:03.920 --> 41:04.920]  check it out.
[41:05.920 --> 41:06.920]  All the information will be right there.
[41:07.920 --> 41:08.920]  Since I'm speaking about Patreon,
[41:09.920 --> 41:10.920]  Kelvin Medina, huge, gigantic shout out
[41:11.920 --> 41:12.920]  and a big fat hug.
[41:13.920 --> 41:14.920]  Thank you.
[41:15.920 --> 41:16.920]  I appreciate all of your support.
[41:17.920 --> 41:18.920]  Let's get back into this email.
[41:19.920 --> 41:20.920]  I was going to say to loop back to the email.
[41:21.920 --> 41:22.920]  One of my favorite things about the show
[41:23.920 --> 41:24.920]  is that it feels like when you're listening
[41:25.920 --> 41:26.920]  to it, it feels like I'm at the table.
[41:27.920 --> 41:28.920]  Yeah.
[41:29.920 --> 41:30.920]  I'm not listening to the show.
[41:31.920 --> 41:32.920]  But I've been listening a lot more
[41:33.920 --> 41:34.920]  now that I'm over here less.
[41:35.920 --> 41:36.920]  Mainly to fill some of the hours
[41:37.920 --> 41:38.920]  at work and stuff.
[41:39.920 --> 41:40.920]  But it makes me feel like I'm getting out
[41:41.920 --> 41:42.920]  and doing a lot more than I actually am.
[41:43.920 --> 41:44.920]  I've been listening to Joey Diaz
[41:45.920 --> 41:46.920]  on podcasts for years.
[41:47.920 --> 41:48.920]  Anybody that listens to this show
[41:49.920 --> 41:50.920]  knows how much I listen to Diaz.
[41:51.920 --> 41:52.920]  Diaz is one of my favorites.
[41:53.920 --> 41:54.920]  And from listening to,
[41:55.920 --> 41:56.920]  and also Chris Hardwick
[41:57.920 --> 41:58.920]  and also Proops, Greg Proops.
[41:59.920 --> 42:00.920]  He's been on every show
[42:01.920 --> 42:02.920]  is the same lately.
[42:03.920 --> 42:04.920]  Sorry Proops, I don't mean to say that,
[42:05.920 --> 42:06.920]  but every show is the fucking same lately.
[42:07.920 --> 42:08.920]  Please switch it up a little bit.
[42:09.920 --> 42:10.920]  I love you.
[42:11.920 --> 42:12.920]  Please switch it up a little.
[42:13.920 --> 42:14.920]  But I've listened to all these
[42:15.920 --> 42:16.920]  comedians' podcasts for so long.
[42:17.920 --> 42:18.920]  Doug Benson.
[42:19.920 --> 42:20.920]  How did I skip Doug Benson?
[42:21.920 --> 42:22.920]  So when I go to see them,
[42:23.920 --> 42:24.920]  it's just like hanging out with you.
[42:25.920 --> 42:26.920]  There's no like stardom.
[42:27.920 --> 42:28.920]  It's like, hey, what up Uncle Joey?
[42:29.920 --> 42:30.920]  Or I'll take Jenny Beth with me
[42:31.920 --> 42:32.920]  or I've taken other friends with me,
[42:33.920 --> 42:34.920]  dudes or females.
[42:35.920 --> 42:36.920]  And some of them get jittery
[42:37.920 --> 42:38.920]  and they get weird and they talk differently
[42:39.920 --> 42:40.920]  than they normally would when I'm around them.
[42:41.920 --> 42:42.920]  Like, Uncle Joey, it's so good to meet you.
[42:43.920 --> 42:44.920]  And I'm like, are you squeaking?
[42:45.920 --> 42:46.920]  Dude, are you squeaking at Uncle Joey?
[42:47.920 --> 42:48.920]  You don't squeak when you talk.
[42:49.920 --> 42:50.920]  What the fuck are you doing?
[42:51.920 --> 42:52.920]  Like people change.
[42:53.920 --> 42:54.920]  And I'm just like, hey, what up Joey?
[42:55.920 --> 42:56.920]  I got some weed.
[42:57.920 --> 42:58.920]  You want to smoke it?
[42:59.920 --> 43:00.920]  I know what he's talking about.
[43:01.920 --> 43:02.920]  Like I relate to it.
[43:03.920 --> 43:04.920]  And so when these people,
[43:05.920 --> 43:06.920]  what I'm getting to is when people say
[43:07.920 --> 43:08.920]  that I'm more like a brother,
[43:09.920 --> 43:10.920]  I reciprocate that feeling.
[43:11.920 --> 43:12.920]  I understand that probably more than some people would.
[43:13.920 --> 43:14.920]  Here's a really random story
[43:15.920 --> 43:16.920]  that's going to make me feel like a fanboy.
[43:17.920 --> 43:18.920]  I've been watching Chris Hardwick since Singled Out.
[43:19.920 --> 43:20.920]  Hardwick's an awesome comedian, funny dude.
[43:21.920 --> 43:22.920]  I've heard him say several times,
[43:23.920 --> 43:24.920]  I want to play Red Rocks.
[43:25.920 --> 43:26.920]  Chris Hardwick is from Denver.
[43:27.920 --> 43:28.920]  One of his wife's goals, bucket list,
[43:29.920 --> 43:30.920]  was to be a star one year.
[43:31.920 --> 43:32.920]  They played at fucking Red Rocks.
[43:33.920 --> 43:34.920]  He walked out on stage
[43:35.920 --> 43:36.920]  and took a selfie of himself.
[43:37.920 --> 43:38.920]  And he goes, I've always wanted to fucking do that.
[43:39.920 --> 43:40.920]  I felt an odd sense of pride.
[43:41.920 --> 43:42.920]  Like you were watching a friend meet a goal?
[43:43.920 --> 43:44.920]  Like you did it.
[43:45.920 --> 43:46.920]  I was like, my bro just fucking got to play Red Rocks, man.
[43:47.920 --> 43:48.920]  That's fucking cool.
[43:49.920 --> 43:50.920]  And honestly, Hardwick's one of the few I've never met.
[43:51.920 --> 43:52.920]  I've seen him.
[43:53.920 --> 43:54.920]  I've seen him do shows,
[43:55.920 --> 43:56.920]  but I've never shook his hand.
[43:57.920 --> 43:58.920]  He doesn't seem like the type to hang out
[43:59.920 --> 44:00.920]  with people who are not his age.
[44:01.920 --> 44:02.920]  Yeah, he's different.
[44:03.920 --> 44:04.920]  He seems like he'd need to be on a plane
[44:05.920 --> 44:06.920]  to go film a talking show.
[44:07.920 --> 44:08.920]  Right, exactly.
[44:09.920 --> 44:10.920]  Exactly, got to record the intro to his podcast
[44:11.920 --> 44:12.920]  in an airplane bathroom real quick.
[44:13.920 --> 44:14.920]  Yep.
[44:15.920 --> 44:16.920]  But anyway, I relate to it
[44:17.920 --> 44:18.920]  because when I saw Hardwick up there at Red Rocks,
[44:19.920 --> 44:20.920]  I was like, my bro Hardwick is fucking doing it.
[44:21.920 --> 44:22.920]  Right.
[44:22.920 --> 44:23.920]  So that was cool.
[44:24.920 --> 44:25.920]  So I get it, you guys.
[44:26.920 --> 44:27.920]  I do get it.
[44:27.920 --> 44:28.920]  I'm not saying that I'm not proud and praised
[44:29.920 --> 44:30.920]  and whatever the other humble words are for it
[44:31.920 --> 44:32.920]  hasn't gotten to my head too much.
[44:33.920 --> 44:34.920]  I still appreciate it.
[44:35.920 --> 44:36.920]  It still means a lot to me to get compliments.
[44:37.920 --> 44:38.920]  I'm trying to stay humble.
[44:39.920 --> 44:40.920]  That's what I think I'm trying to say.
[44:41.920 --> 44:42.920]  Anyway, I want to continue with this email
[44:43.920 --> 44:44.920]  because I'm making it really fucking long.
[44:45.920 --> 44:46.920]  Usually Mike's the damn rambly one.
[44:47.920 --> 44:48.920]  I saw the length of the text on the page.
[44:49.920 --> 44:50.920]  I knew this was going to be a good content-length
[44:51.920 --> 44:52.920]  email, folks.
[44:53.920 --> 44:54.920]  Oh, man, there's an email that I didn't print
[44:55.920 --> 44:56.920]  that I wanted to read.
[44:57.920 --> 44:58.920]  Let's find it.
[44:59.920 --> 45:00.920]  We may press pause and find it here in just a minute.
[45:01.920 --> 45:02.920]  This guy says, also, I live in Colorado
[45:03.920 --> 45:04.920]  and I represent my state rights by maintaining
[45:05.920 --> 45:06.920]  my luscious closet grow operation.
[45:07.920 --> 45:08.920]  I need to branch out with some new genetics
[45:09.920 --> 45:10.920]  and I feel confident you've got the quality
[45:11.920 --> 45:12.920]  I'm looking for.
[45:13.920 --> 45:14.920]  Let's go get a slapper, bro.
[45:15.920 --> 45:16.920]  I can recommend thedankteam.com
[45:20.920 --> 45:21.920]  or the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[45:22.920 --> 45:23.920]  That's what I can tell you.
[45:24.920 --> 45:25.920]  Then he says, let's meet up.
[45:25.920 --> 45:26.920]  Then he says he was going to be at a comedy show
[45:27.920 --> 45:28.920]  which already happened and we did not meet up
[45:29.920 --> 45:32.920]  so I apologize for that, Mr. Zane.
[45:33.920 --> 45:34.920]  Hey, I do appreciate the email.
[45:35.920 --> 45:36.920]  I'm sorry that I'm just reading emails from September.
[45:37.920 --> 45:38.920]  That's not too bad.
[45:39.920 --> 45:40.920]  Yeah, but they were in this email box
[45:41.920 --> 45:42.920]  that I didn't-
[45:43.920 --> 45:44.920]  Did your phone hit?
[45:45.920 --> 45:46.920]  Yeah, it was like, hey, you don't get to see these.
[45:47.920 --> 45:48.920]  I had a relative recently get married
[45:49.920 --> 45:50.920]  from my nuclear family.
[45:51.920 --> 45:52.920]  Say that again?
[45:53.920 --> 45:54.920]  From my nuclear family.
[45:55.920 --> 45:56.920]  Say that for me.
[45:57.920 --> 45:58.920]  Mother, father, brothers.
[45:59.920 --> 46:00.920]  Nuclear.
[46:01.920 --> 46:02.920]  Did I just use a word you're not familiar with?
[46:03.920 --> 46:04.920]  I don't know that I've ever heard it used like that.
[46:05.920 --> 46:06.920]  I'm pretty high and I was totally focused
[46:07.920 --> 46:08.920]  on another idea in my head.
[46:09.920 --> 46:10.920]  I was going to go find this email
[46:11.920 --> 46:12.920]  where somebody said something, but okay, nuclear.
[46:13.920 --> 46:14.920]  For some reason, the family,
[46:15.920 --> 46:16.920]  the email chain about the wedding,
[46:17.920 --> 46:18.920]  they used the email I haven't checked
[46:19.920 --> 46:20.920]  since at the end of high school.
[46:21.920 --> 46:22.920]  Aw.
[46:23.920 --> 46:24.920]  At one point, I got a phone call
[46:25.920 --> 46:26.920]  from my wife and I was like, what the fuck?
[46:27.920 --> 46:28.920]  I was like, what the hell are you talking about?
[46:29.920 --> 46:30.920]  I have plane tickets past that.
[46:31.920 --> 46:32.920]  I haven't thought about it at all.
[46:33.920 --> 46:34.920]  They're like, well, check your email.
[46:35.920 --> 46:36.920]  I opened it up and I had 208 unresponded emails
[46:37.920 --> 46:38.920]  about this event.
[46:39.920 --> 46:40.920]  I was like, oh shit.
[46:41.920 --> 46:42.920]  That's why I'm not the white sheep.
[46:43.920 --> 46:44.920]  Yep.
[46:45.920 --> 46:46.920]  Well, I'm looking for this-
[46:47.920 --> 46:48.920]  For the last email that you found.
[46:49.920 --> 46:50.920]  Yeah, but no, we'll just save it
[46:51.920 --> 46:52.920]  for another episode because there are
[46:53.920 --> 46:54.920]  so many great emails in here.
[46:55.920 --> 46:56.920]  We'll save it for this other one.
[46:57.920 --> 46:58.920]  I'm high as giraffe pussy.
[46:59.920 --> 47:00.920]  I thought we were at least at an hour and a half.
[47:01.920 --> 47:02.920]  Well, we would be if you hadn't
[47:03.920 --> 47:04.920]  taken a cigarette break, Mike.
[47:05.920 --> 47:06.920]  Fair point.
[47:07.920 --> 47:08.920]  Yeah, yeah.
[47:09.920 --> 47:10.920]  So how are we going to save the world?
[47:11.920 --> 47:12.920]  Save it or take it over?
[47:13.920 --> 47:14.920]  I don't remember.
[47:15.920 --> 47:16.920]  I think they're the same thing.
[47:17.920 --> 47:18.920]  You guys should really try this Bortello.
[47:19.920 --> 47:20.920]  Mike, are you that lit?
[47:21.920 --> 47:22.920]  I'm getting there.
[47:23.920 --> 47:24.920]  The CBD, I think, wore off.
[47:25.920 --> 47:26.920]  I think it's been the last 10 minutes.
[47:27.920 --> 47:28.920]  All right, Mike.
[47:29.920 --> 47:30.920]  I want to read this other email
[47:31.920 --> 47:32.920]  because you're super high and there's no reason
[47:33.920 --> 47:34.920]  to quit recording if you're this lit
[47:35.920 --> 47:36.920]  and having that good of a time.
[47:37.920 --> 47:38.920]  I'm having a good time with you
[47:39.920 --> 47:40.920]  and I'm sure the listeners enjoy listening to us.
[47:41.920 --> 47:42.920]  But I have to dig through my phone to find it.
[47:43.920 --> 47:44.920]  So what I need from you is a solid two minutes
[47:45.920 --> 47:46.920]  of just soapbox Mike.
[47:47.920 --> 47:48.920]  You want me to soapbox it?
[47:49.920 --> 47:50.920]  Yeah, get up on a soapbox.
[47:51.920 --> 47:52.920]  Okay, so I got a fan reached out
[47:53.920 --> 47:54.920]  through Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Law's
[47:55.920 --> 47:56.920]  and they asked me about Texas medical marijuana law
[47:57.920 --> 47:58.920]  and some tips about advancing
[47:59.920 --> 48:02.920]  the legalization cause down in Tejas.
[48:03.920 --> 48:04.920]  So I, for the first time ever,
[48:05.920 --> 48:06.920]  looked up Texas' medical marijuana law.
[48:07.920 --> 48:08.920]  I hadn't even heard about it.
[48:09.920 --> 48:10.920]  I'd been so busy that got past me.
[48:11.920 --> 48:14.920]  And their law is like 10 milligrams of CBD,
[48:15.920 --> 48:17.920]  less than half a milligram of THC,
[48:18.920 --> 48:20.920]  oil only, like super bullshit-y.
[48:21.920 --> 48:22.920]  And they were asking me what I thought
[48:22.920 --> 48:23.920]  they should do to advance the cause.
[48:24.920 --> 48:25.920]  And I gave them the,
[48:26.920 --> 48:27.920]  you can dig back through the pile
[48:28.920 --> 48:29.920]  and find a whole 45 minute show
[48:30.920 --> 48:31.920]  on going to city council
[48:32.920 --> 48:33.920]  and getting involved in local politics
[48:34.920 --> 48:35.920]  and researching and going and making
[48:36.920 --> 48:38.920]  a solid argument that we did for a podcast.
[48:39.920 --> 48:40.920]  And I kind of gave them that spiel
[48:41.920 --> 48:42.920]  and then I thought about it for a minute.
[48:43.920 --> 48:44.920]  I was like, don't fucking leave.
[48:45.920 --> 48:46.920]  You know a trade, you work in a trade,
[48:47.920 --> 48:48.920]  save up some money.
[48:49.920 --> 48:50.920]  And the more I thought about it,
[48:50.920 --> 48:51.920]  I'm like, if I was in that situation,
[48:52.920 --> 48:53.920]  I would save up as much as I could
[48:54.920 --> 48:55.920]  and I would bail.
[48:56.920 --> 48:57.920]  Like, if it's possible for you
[48:58.920 --> 48:59.920]  to leave a place that sucks
[49:00.920 --> 49:01.920]  and join a place that doesn't suck,
[49:02.920 --> 49:03.920]  why not do it?
[49:04.920 --> 49:05.920]  And I'm thinking about Maine right now too.
[49:06.920 --> 49:07.920]  And there are a lot of people
[49:08.920 --> 49:09.920]  that work really hard.
[49:10.920 --> 49:11.920]  And easily the biggest moron
[49:12.920 --> 49:13.920]  in that square area
[49:14.920 --> 49:15.920]  just fucked it up for everybody.
[49:16.920 --> 49:17.920]  And now your choice is
[49:18.920 --> 49:19.920]  fight for another two to four years
[49:20.920 --> 49:21.920]  and get back to where you were yesterday.
[49:22.920 --> 49:25.920]  Or work for six months,
[49:26.920 --> 49:27.920]  live on a tight budget,
[49:28.920 --> 49:29.920]  move out of hell.
[49:30.920 --> 49:32.920]  And I can't say I don't recommend option B.
[49:33.920 --> 49:34.920]  If you live in a place
[49:35.920 --> 49:36.920]  that's sort of in between hell and heaven
[49:37.920 --> 49:38.920]  or hell and Colorado,
[49:39.920 --> 49:42.920]  feel free to fight a lot harder
[49:43.920 --> 49:44.920]  or maybe think a lot harder about fighting
[49:45.920 --> 49:46.920]  than moving.
[49:47.920 --> 49:48.920]  But if you're in a place
[49:48.920 --> 49:49.920]  where they're still doing
[49:50.920 --> 49:51.920]  roadside cavity searches
[49:52.920 --> 49:53.920]  for I smell weed in the car ladies,
[49:54.920 --> 49:57.920]  like, I wouldn't feel bad
[49:58.920 --> 49:59.920]  about putting the rest of my shit in the truck
[50:00.920 --> 50:02.920]  and heading out with just me and my bank account.
[50:03.920 --> 50:04.920]  If you're going to do so,
[50:05.920 --> 50:06.920]  have a plan though.
[50:07.920 --> 50:08.920]  Definitely come up with a plan.
[50:09.920 --> 50:10.920]  Like, don't just run away.
[50:11.920 --> 50:12.920]  But it's not that hard
[50:13.920 --> 50:14.920]  to move across country and start over,
[50:15.920 --> 50:16.920]  especially if you make a plan.
[50:16.920 --> 50:17.920]  Save up some money,
[50:18.920 --> 50:19.920]  like more than a few months rent,
[50:20.920 --> 50:22.920]  and look for jobs in your area,
[50:23.920 --> 50:24.920]  out wherever you want to move.
[50:25.920 --> 50:27.920]  There's like 26 states that have medical programs.
[50:28.920 --> 50:29.920]  You don't have to go
[50:30.920 --> 50:32.920]  for a medical or for a marijuana job.
[50:33.920 --> 50:34.920]  Just because you're moving, this is something that...
[50:35.920 --> 50:36.920]  No, we need lawyers and bankers and welders
[50:37.920 --> 50:38.920]  and people that make tacos.
[50:39.920 --> 50:40.920]  It seems to trip a lot of people up.
[50:41.920 --> 50:42.920]  They move here from another state
[50:43.920 --> 50:44.920]  and they're like, I'm going to go get a weed job.
[50:44.920 --> 50:45.920]  I'm going to be in the industry.
[50:46.920 --> 50:47.920]  I'm like, well, what are you going to do?
[50:48.920 --> 50:49.920]  Can you trim? Can you bud tend?
[50:50.920 --> 50:51.920]  Can you fucking grow weed?
[50:52.920 --> 50:53.920]  No, I'm going to get a job in the industry though.
[50:54.920 --> 50:55.920]  No, you're not.
[50:56.920 --> 50:57.920]  You're going to come be a burden.
[50:58.920 --> 50:59.920]  Have a skill.
[51:00.920 --> 51:01.920]  Whatever you're doing, where you are,
[51:02.920 --> 51:03.920]  you can do that here and have legal cannabis accessible.
[51:04.920 --> 51:05.920]  Unless you're a deep sea fisherman,
[51:06.920 --> 51:07.920]  we have your job here.
[51:08.920 --> 51:09.920]  Yeah, you know what I got.
[51:10.920 --> 51:11.920]  No, seriously,
[51:12.920 --> 51:13.920]  and that's through the continental United States.
[51:14.920 --> 51:15.920]  You can fucking move to Oregon or Washington.
[51:16.920 --> 51:17.920]  They're on a fucking ocean too.
[51:18.920 --> 51:19.920]  Yeah, there are places you can go that have got your skill.
[51:20.920 --> 51:21.920]  What I'm saying though is don't be too stubborn
[51:22.920 --> 51:23.920]  and think just because you're moving to a weed state,
[51:24.920 --> 51:25.920]  you have to go full on weed and work in the weed industry,
[51:26.920 --> 51:27.920]  be a weed-stagram person.
[51:28.920 --> 51:29.920]  You don't have to do all of that.
[51:30.920 --> 51:31.920]  You can just move here and have a normal people job
[51:32.920 --> 51:33.920]  and have access to safe, clean medicine
[51:34.920 --> 51:35.920]  by going to a dispenser.
[51:36.920 --> 51:37.920]  You could be discreet about it.
[51:38.920 --> 51:39.920]  You can move here and never tell anybody
[51:40.920 --> 51:41.920]  that you moved here for weed.
[51:42.920 --> 51:43.920]  Be like, why'd you move here?
[51:44.920 --> 51:45.920]  We definitely need,
[51:46.920 --> 51:47.920]  like Colorado's expanding,
[51:48.920 --> 51:49.920]  lots of people moved here.
[51:50.920 --> 51:51.920]  They need dentists and teachers
[51:52.920 --> 51:53.920]  and people to iron their shirts and fucking everybody.
[51:54.920 --> 51:55.920]  Business executives.
[51:56.920 --> 51:59.920]  It is that kind of show, folks.
[52:00.920 --> 52:01.920]  All right.
[52:02.920 --> 52:03.920]  Mike, I wanted you to ramble so that I could find this email.
[52:04.920 --> 52:05.920]  Did you find it?
[52:06.920 --> 52:07.920]  I am here, dude.
[52:08.920 --> 52:09.920]  Dive us in.
[52:09.920 --> 52:10.920]  Got it.
[52:11.920 --> 52:12.920]  It's a quick one, but it's great.
[52:12.920 --> 52:13.920]  This dude wants to go by the name Collard Greens.
[52:14.920 --> 52:15.920]  So what up, my G, Collard Greens?
[52:16.920 --> 52:17.920]  The message goes like this.
[52:18.920 --> 52:19.920]  Howdy, Jeff.
[52:20.920 --> 52:21.920]  Just wanted to send you some grower's love
[52:22.920 --> 52:23.920]  from the great state of Massachusetts.
[52:24.920 --> 52:25.920]  What up, you asshole?
[52:26.920 --> 52:27.920]  I've been to Massachusetts, had a good time.
[52:28.920 --> 52:29.920]  Went to Newbury Street, hated it,
[52:30.920 --> 52:31.920]  but the rest of Massachusetts was decent.
[52:32.920 --> 52:33.920]  He says, been growing my own top-notch organic medicine
[52:34.920 --> 52:35.920]  for at least a few years now,
[52:36.920 --> 52:37.920]  and I love everything about it.
[52:38.920 --> 52:39.920]  Well, congratulations on the continued successful garden.
[52:40.920 --> 52:41.920]  I'm proud of you.
[52:42.920 --> 52:43.920]  I'm proud of Cannabis.
[52:44.920 --> 52:45.920]  Let me rephrase that and slow my face down.
[52:46.920 --> 52:47.920]  The most addictive part of Cannabis is growing it.
[52:48.920 --> 52:49.920]  Heard about your podcast from Scotty Real and The Dude.
[52:50.920 --> 52:51.920]  A big shout out to those boys.
[52:52.920 --> 52:53.920]  We just gave them a shout out a moment ago.
[52:54.920 --> 52:55.920]  It's what made me think of this email.
[52:56.920 --> 52:57.920]  It's the psychic.
[52:58.920 --> 52:59.920]  I knew it was coming.
[53:00.920 --> 53:01.920]  He said, I really credit their podcast
[53:02.920 --> 53:03.920]  with my excellent performance in my garden,
[53:04.920 --> 53:05.920]  and now I get extra details to polish my technique
[53:06.920 --> 53:07.920]  from your library of listening.
[53:08.920 --> 53:09.920]  Here's something really funny.
[53:10.920 --> 53:11.920]  At least I thought so.
[53:12.920 --> 53:13.920]  They mentioned that you keep it clean.
[53:14.920 --> 53:15.920]  The first episode I listened to,
[53:16.920 --> 53:17.920]  you read a comment about your fucking cool show
[53:18.920 --> 53:19.920]  or something with lots of F-bombs,
[53:20.920 --> 53:21.920]  and the next episode had a butthole song.
[53:22.920 --> 53:23.920]  That's really fucking hilarious.
[53:24.920 --> 53:25.920]  Perfect timing.
[53:26.920 --> 53:27.920]  I wonder if they listened to the boofing episode.
[53:28.920 --> 53:29.920]  I'm not sure which one was the butthole song.
[53:30.920 --> 53:31.920]  Then he said, that's really fucking hilarious.
[53:32.920 --> 53:33.920]  Not at all what I was expecting to hear,
[53:34.920 --> 53:35.920]  and I love you for it.
[53:36.920 --> 53:37.920]  Earned yourself a new disciple, my friend.
[53:38.920 --> 53:39.920]  Anyway, no secrecy about my name needed.
[53:40.920 --> 53:41.920]  Not a fan of the podcast,
[53:42.920 --> 53:43.920]  not searching for cred,
[53:44.920 --> 53:45.920]  but not hiding either.
[53:46.920 --> 53:47.920]  Keep on teaching from Collard Greens.
[53:48.920 --> 53:49.920]  Collard Greens, I love you, man.
[53:50.920 --> 53:51.920]  Or, or, no up to man.
[53:52.920 --> 53:53.920]  Love you, man.
[53:54.920 --> 53:55.920]  Thanks for all the love.
[53:56.920 --> 53:57.920]  Thanks for reaching out.
[53:58.920 --> 53:59.920]  I think it's funny.
[54:00.920 --> 54:01.920]  For a little while,
[54:02.920 --> 54:03.920]  when I first started podcasting,
[54:04.920 --> 54:05.920]  I had a dirty mouth.
[54:06.920 --> 54:07.920]  I was on another podcast.
[54:08.920 --> 54:09.920]  It was comedy-based.
[54:10.920 --> 54:11.920]  I was hanging out with a group of folks
[54:12.920 --> 54:13.920]  who were really good.
[54:14.920 --> 54:15.920]  Some of them go hold a microphone
[54:16.920 --> 54:17.920]  for four minutes and embarrass everybody.
[54:18.920 --> 54:19.920]  Some of them are actually fucking good.
[54:20.920 --> 54:21.920]  I'm just being a smartass about it.
[54:22.920 --> 54:23.920]  When I would leave that show
[54:24.920 --> 54:25.920]  and come to court,
[54:26.920 --> 54:27.920]  I would come do this show
[54:28.920 --> 54:29.920]  with a bad comedian attitude.
[54:30.920 --> 54:31.920]  It doesn't stop when you hit.
[54:32.920 --> 54:33.920]  You act how you're fed.
[54:34.920 --> 54:35.920]  You know what I mean?
[54:36.920 --> 54:37.920]  That comedy would continue throughout my day.
[54:38.920 --> 54:39.920]  I would just come be a witty asshole.
[54:40.920 --> 54:41.920]  It didn't work on the show,
[54:42.920 --> 54:43.920]  but I got to a point where I was like,
[54:44.920 --> 54:45.920]  man, I cuss too much.
[54:46.920 --> 54:47.920]  I'm going to stop cussing.
[54:48.920 --> 54:49.920]  I put up a swear jar
[54:50.920 --> 54:51.920]  to where every time I said fuck,
[54:52.920 --> 54:53.920]  I had to put money in the jar.
[54:54.920 --> 54:55.920]  We donated that to a charity.
[54:56.920 --> 54:57.920]  I was like, you know what?
[54:58.920 --> 54:59.920]  That feels weird.
[55:00.920 --> 55:01.920]  I say fuck.
[55:02.920 --> 55:03.920]  I have a bad mouth.
[55:04.920 --> 55:05.920]  It helped to tone it down,
[55:06.920 --> 55:07.920]  but it got unnecessary after a point.
[55:08.920 --> 55:09.920]  I would feel weird because I'd come over here
[55:10.920 --> 55:11.920]  and you'd be doing a really good job not swearing.
[55:12.920 --> 55:13.920]  This is my podcast.
[55:14.920 --> 55:15.920]  We can put the explicit rating up on iTunes
[55:16.920 --> 55:17.920]  and all the fucking adults can listen.
[55:18.920 --> 55:19.920]  That's how it'll fucking be.
[55:20.920 --> 55:23.920]  Eventually, I did just drop the facade
[55:24.920 --> 55:25.920]  and I like to be myself on my podcast.
[55:26.920 --> 55:27.920]  Now, it's a lot more fun, honestly.
[55:28.920 --> 55:29.920]  Somewhere around episode 100,
[55:30.920 --> 55:31.920]  I just got really comfortable here with the microphone.
[55:32.920 --> 55:33.920]  I'm lucky enough to have been a guest
[55:34.920 --> 55:35.920]  on a few podcasts.
[55:36.920 --> 55:37.920]  Shout out to my friend Tim Martin
[55:38.920 --> 55:39.920]  on the John Doe Radio podcast.
[55:40.920 --> 55:41.920]  I was lucky enough to be a guest on that.
[55:42.920 --> 55:43.920]  I got to be a host of other shows.
[55:44.920 --> 55:47.920]  Then also, I got to be a co-host and producer
[55:48.920 --> 55:49.920]  of a whole other podcast that did...
[55:50.920 --> 55:51.920]  We did close to 100 episodes
[55:52.920 --> 55:53.920]  before I parted ways with them.
[55:54.920 --> 55:55.920]  They wanted to do a whole other thing
[55:56.920 --> 55:57.920]  and the dude actually moved away from town.
[55:58.920 --> 55:59.920]  I just ended that relationship with that podcast.
[56:00.920 --> 56:01.920]  I got a very good warm-up start there.
[56:02.920 --> 56:04.920]  I was basically comfortable when I got on this show.
[56:05.920 --> 56:06.920]  The hard part of this show is finding
[56:07.920 --> 56:08.920]  this show's voice and the rhythm
[56:09.920 --> 56:10.920]  and what I wanted to do with it.
[56:10.920 --> 56:11.920]  I had a lot of weird segments and weird shit.
[56:12.920 --> 56:13.920]  I think it's better when we just start
[56:14.920 --> 56:15.920]  and talk and hang out and have a good show.
[56:16.920 --> 56:17.920]  When you first started doing
[56:18.920 --> 56:19.920]  the Throwback Thursday episodes,
[56:20.920 --> 56:21.920]  I had completely forgotten the segments.
[56:22.920 --> 56:23.920]  In the first episode where you skipped a segment,
[56:24.920 --> 56:25.920]  I was like, oh, but where is it?
[56:26.920 --> 56:27.920]  I was expecting that.
[56:28.920 --> 56:29.920]  It's hard to keep all those segments going.
[56:30.920 --> 56:31.920]  It's hard to keep all that shit happening.
[56:32.920 --> 56:33.920]  We got off on to a really good ramble
[56:34.920 --> 56:35.920]  because of this email.
[56:36.920 --> 56:37.920]  I like it.
[56:38.920 --> 56:39.920]  It's not necessarily the email's fault, bro.
[56:40.920 --> 56:41.920]  It's all the good hash.
[56:42.920 --> 56:43.920]  I haven't felt well lately.
[56:44.920 --> 56:45.920]  I haven't been able to dab hard.
[56:46.920 --> 56:47.920]  Mike and I dabbed a little bit hard.
[56:48.920 --> 56:49.920]  I think we got a little bit lit up tonight.
[56:50.920 --> 56:51.920]  It was a long week.
[56:52.920 --> 56:53.920]  I needed it.
[56:54.920 --> 56:55.920]  It was a long week.
[56:56.920 --> 56:57.920]  I want to thank everybody for all the emails
[56:58.920 --> 56:59.920]  they've sent me.
[57:00.920 --> 57:01.920]  I apologize.
[57:02.920 --> 57:03.920]  I know I've got a bunch of emails
[57:04.920 --> 57:05.920]  from a long time ago, but I will get to them.
[57:06.920 --> 57:07.920]  I will try to do my best to answer all of them.
[57:08.920 --> 57:09.920]  Big shout out to our friend Collard Greens
[57:10.920 --> 57:11.920]  who will help you do that.
[57:12.920 --> 57:13.920]  I will get the phone back.
[57:14.920 --> 57:15.920]  My disciples take people's phones,
[57:16.920 --> 57:17.920]  add the podcast to their auto download,
[57:18.920 --> 57:19.920]  and put the phone back.
[57:20.920 --> 57:21.920]  Shout out to my friend Brett,
[57:22.920 --> 57:23.920]  also known as Mary's Motivation on Instagram.
[57:24.920 --> 57:25.920]  Brett will grab your phone and be like,
[57:26.920 --> 57:27.920]  you should listen to my friend Jeff's podcast.
[57:28.920 --> 57:29.920]  He will put it into your phone for you.
[57:30.920 --> 57:31.920]  No work on your part.
[57:32.920 --> 57:33.920]  Just click the button.
[57:34.920 --> 57:35.920]  That's right, all you got to do is listen.
[57:36.920 --> 57:37.920]  Every Monday morning a little icon will light up
[57:38.920 --> 57:39.920]  and it says,
[57:40.920 --> 57:44.580]  Uh, the episode, uh, the what fucking number was it?
[57:44.580 --> 57:47.840]  Two 50 contest where people got to win prizes and get stickers.

[57:52.380 --> 57:53.720]  put some stickers in them for you.
[57:54.000 --> 57:56.100]  Uh, depending on where you are, who you are and what you did,
[57:56.400 --> 57:57.600]  uh, you'll get a different prize.
[57:57.860 --> 57:59.800]  Uh, you're going to at least get a couple of stickers from me.
[58:00.060 --> 58:01.320]  Who knows what the stickers may be.
[58:01.320 --> 58:02.760]  Hopefully it's an Irish genetic sticker.
[58:02.760 --> 58:06.420]  I've got a really nice sticker pack I can give to people that I put them together.
[58:07.000 --> 58:07.660]  You'll enjoy it.
[58:07.820 --> 58:09.160]  Just, uh, send me your address.
[58:09.160 --> 58:13.480]  However, uh, I'd like the, I'd like it if you send it to me via email would be the
[58:13.480 --> 58:16.240]  best, uh, grow from your heart at hotmail.com.

[58:30.460 --> 58:31.920]  the right answer, send me your address.
[58:31.920 --> 58:32.720]  We'll get you some stickers.
[58:32.720 --> 58:33.820]  I am going to check fuckers.
[58:33.820 --> 58:35.160]  Don't try to, don't try to troll me.
[58:35.160 --> 58:35.520]  Right.
[58:35.600 --> 58:38.400]  And if you follow directions, that's right.
[58:38.400 --> 58:42.680]  More likely to get your prize, grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[58:42.720 --> 58:46.560]  Life is difficult when you've got 42 different social media platforms to monitor.
[58:47.080 --> 58:47.280]  Yeah.
[58:47.280 --> 58:49.140]  And I'm a busy dude, so it's hard to go through all of them.
[58:49.140 --> 58:50.960]  I'll scroll through Twitter and be like, ah, fuck.
[58:50.960 --> 58:52.280]  I had that message a year ago.
[58:52.600 --> 58:55.200]  People don't understand what we do at work.
[58:55.640 --> 58:57.480]  No, they think we're smoking a lot of weed all day.
[58:57.480 --> 59:02.200]  And we talk to people in the building that physically see what we do all day.
[59:02.200 --> 59:03.960]  They don't understand what we do all day.
[59:04.680 --> 59:07.040]  Um, it's a lot of work, y'all.
[59:07.120 --> 59:07.440]  Yeah.
[59:07.640 --> 59:07.800]  Yeah.
[59:07.800 --> 59:11.960]  Everybody that's before the podcast and the personal life and the family and all
[59:11.960 --> 59:18.360]  of that, the home grow and the fucking breeding projects and the kids, whatever
[59:18.360 --> 59:21.880]  else, everybody else has everybody at that grow has something else going on.
[59:22.360 --> 59:22.960]  Everybody.
[59:23.440 --> 59:23.720]  Yeah.
[59:24.440 --> 59:25.040]  Everybody.
[59:27.320 --> 59:29.480]  All right, Mike, we've been going for just about an hour.
[59:29.800 --> 59:31.480]  Uh, do you have anything to say?
[59:31.480 --> 59:33.320]  Well, you've got a microphone in front of your face and a whole bunch of
[59:33.320 --> 59:34.200]  people are going to be listening.
[59:34.440 --> 59:37.360]  Um, check out my social media if you're interested.
[59:37.520 --> 59:42.280]  Uh, it's Nemo Punk 15 on Twitter and Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws on Facebook.
[59:43.040 --> 59:48.440]  Um, I've been a little uninspired with Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws lately.
[59:48.760 --> 59:51.600]  I used to do a bunch of really long winded elaborate posts and
[59:51.600 --> 59:52.920]  then get like one comment on them.
[59:53.560 --> 59:57.600]  Um, and I'd get like 1500, 2000 views, but one comment.
[59:58.440 --> 01:00:01.040]  And over the last couple of months with the new gig, I've been a little
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:05.360]  uninspired, so keep hitting me up on there, re-inspire me, re-inspire my buddy.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.080]  Mike, get him going.
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.360]  You guys go troll him a little bit.
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:08.760]  Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:09.760]  Get him fired up.
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:12.000]  Um, we mentioned Patreon earlier.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.960]  I would love it if you guys check us out on Patreon, patreon.com
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:16.360]  slash grow from your heart.
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:18.920]  If you'd like to contribute to the podcast, I would appreciate the
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:20.520]  support, not trying to get rich.
[01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:26.440]  However, if you guys would like to pay my monthly wage, I would just be a podcaster.
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:28.760]  If you want a lot more content, think about it.
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:29.720]  So much content.
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:30.360]  I would do it.
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:30.880]  I would do it.
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.160]  I'm not asking one person to do it.
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:33.400]  I'm asking the collective.
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:34.040]  All right.
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:36.400]  Anyway, uh, that may come true and I'd get scared.
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:41.280]  Uh, you get that email one day and you're like, well, fuck, I really liked growing.
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:42.320]  Or I'll do it.
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:42.920]  I'll do it.
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:43.720]  I'm getting old.
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:47.400]  Um, also I'd love it if you guys support me on social media, I'm on Facebook.
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:49.560]  Uh, search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast on Twitter.
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:51.080]  It's at GFYH podcast.
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:52.880]  You guys, Instagram.
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:54.560]  I'm all over the Instagram.
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:56.520]  It's IRI underscore genetics.
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.480]  I R I E underscore genetics.
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:00:59.520]  Make sure you check that out.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  Occasionally I will jump on Instagram live and do an Instagram live video where I will
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.880]  talk about a lot of material that I plan on doing on the podcast.
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:10.480]  I get a lot of ideas from my Instagram live audience.
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:12.880]  I interact a lot and it's been a lot of fun.
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.240]  I can't do it constantly.
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.760]  I like to do it sometimes after work, after I've taken a shower and I'm sitting
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:20.800]  here taking a couple of dabs and I'm chilling out, that's my favorite time to do it.
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:23.200]  So, uh, check me out on Instagram live.
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:26.440]  If you've got the option and or opportunity.
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:32.560]  Is lucky Instagram live viewers got a shot of me on video tonight.
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:34.120]  They got to see Mike a little bit today.
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:37.040]  They know what white Mike looks like.
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:37.840]  That's harder to say.
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:38.800]  People don't see me.
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:40.800]  It sounded weird when I said that.
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:44.760]  Anyway, if you'd like to contact us and you are not into the social media thing,
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:45.800]  you can simply email me.
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.360]  If you've been listening, you know, by now the email address is
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:50.480]  growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:53.960]  I want to thank everybody that sent me emails that got read on this episode.
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:56.920]  I want to thank everybody that sent me emails that got read on previous episodes.
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:01.640]  And even more, I want to thank people that send me episodes in the future.
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:02.720]  No episodes, emails.
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:03.160]  Fuck.
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:04.280]  I almost said something smooth.
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:06.960]  Damn dabs are wrecking my brain.
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:07.600]  Yep.
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:09.360]  Oh, I'm fried too.
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:12.000]  I can't believe it's we're only about an hour.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.520]  It feels like this was a really long show, a good show, but it feels way longer.
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:18.680]  You took that one dab Mike that made you time travel.
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:19.600]  It did that.
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.040]  Bordeaux took me fun places.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.040]  I think it did.
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:22.560]  Dude.
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.560]  CSC has just been crushing my meds lately.
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:25.080]  I'm loving it.
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:26.320]  Nice.
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:31.000]  Um, also guys, uh, don't forget a lot of videos are up on YouTube now.
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:32.840]  I've been putting more and more YouTube videos.
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.560]  Uh, I saw now a hundred.
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:34.760]  Yeah.
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:36.640]  One came out this morning too, at 10 o'clock.
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:37.760]  It'd be one Oh one Oh six.
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:38.400]  So one Oh nine.
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:39.200]  There's a lot of them.
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:41.120]  There will be more Alexia is fucking with me.
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:43.320]  Number Alexia got the numbers backwards.
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:44.480]  You're just thinking about 69.
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:46.840]  Or 96, 96.
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.160]  You can do it all backwards that way.
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:48.880]  That's fine.
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:50.480]  Awkward.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.840]  Maybe some editing to be done at the end of this podcast or maybe not.
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:55.560]  Yeah.
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:57.720]  Well, thanks all kinds folks.
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:59.400]  It's all kinds.
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:00.720]  Mike is one of those kinds.
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:01.000]  Yep.
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:03.280]  We take your type around here.
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.800]  We take, I resemble that remark.
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:07.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're getting weird.
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:08.520]  So we're going to turn off these microphones.
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:09.840]  We're going to take a couple of dabs.
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:10.120]  Yeah.
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.320]  Oddly enough, more hashes.
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:12.600]  The answer to this particular, yeah.
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:14.640]  Well, I think food is my answer here pretty soon.
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:15.600]  I've got Chinese food.
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:16.000]  I don't know.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:16.640]  I do not.
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:17.160]  I don't know.
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:17.680]  I don't know.
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:18.200]  I don't know.
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:18.680]  I don't know.
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:20.560]  Oh, I do not have Chinese food at home.
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:21.440]  So you shut your mouth.
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:25.840]  That you're going to have soul food in a little while.
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:26.360]  Don't hate.
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:27.640]  Whoa.
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:29.480]  Cutting deep.
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:29.840]  Whitey.
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:31.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:34.600]  Um, I will be back Thursday, of course, with the throwback Thursday episode.
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:37.600]  Then I'll be back Monday with a brand new episode where we will talk
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:39.400]  about listener generated content.
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.760]  Um, I want to thank everybody for listening.
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:43.680]  Mike, I want to thank you for coming and hanging out and getting
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:44.720]  dabbed in the shit with me.
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.200]  The look on your face is great, bro.
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:47.800]  I can see how high you are.
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:49.160]  It's amazing.
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:51.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, make sure you follow Mike on social media so
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:53.640]  you can interact with this high ass.
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:55.400]  Yeah, I'm usually less high.
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:03:58.920]  Shout out.
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:00.720]  I've been this toasted in a minute.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:01.320]  That's good.
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:02.080]  I enjoy this.
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:02.680]  This is fun.
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:03.640]  Thanks for coming over, buddy.
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:04.240]  Hell yeah.
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:05.080]  Uh, shout out to him.
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:06.920]  For, uh, for listening listeners.
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:09.800]  If you made it this far, uh, I would go high five.
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:10.840]  High five.
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:14.320]  If he's high five right now, he might even miss.
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:15.440]  All right.
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:17.720]  Make sure you check us out on the throwback Thursday episode.
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:19.280]  Please let me know what you think about those.
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:21.560]  Uh, follow us on all the social media.
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:23.400]  Listen to us on YouTube.
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:27.440]  Um, I apologize if Stitcher fails, you guys have to be on my control.
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:28.360]  I'm doing my best.
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:30.520]  They keep sending me emails that say, Oh, well.
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:32.480]  Uh, that's all I've got for you.
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:33.520]  I'm going to quit rambling.
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:35.840]  I'm going to give a huge shout out to my friend bag seed, Jesse.
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:39.680]  And until next time, take a fat dad and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:03.880]  More than often.
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:05.400]  I drive so much.
[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:08.240]  It is like my ass is my feet.
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:15.440]  I see little black furry running dogs and I'm standing up in my seat.
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:23.880]  I'm standing up in my seat to avoid sleep, driving, crashing and dying.
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:28.600]  You got to turn up the dude rest area.
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:33.400]  Next ride is my salvation because I'm running on.
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:36.640]  I'm running on.
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:38.680]  I'm running on.
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:54.720]  Let's get heavy.
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:57.400]  Window goes down on my face.
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:59.120]  I begin to beat.
[01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:03.640]  Keep my eyes open until I get there.
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:06.240]  Then I'll kick back that bucket seat.
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:09.640]  Gonna kick back that bucket seat.
[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:14.320]  Scattered, smothered, covered and chunked.
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.600]  Maybe a short stack.
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:21.320]  Mountain dew, many things and camel lights.
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:23.920]  It's a boxer, a soft pack.
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:27.200]  Boxers, soft.
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:03.520]  Dollars is cheap for five hours in a motel bed.
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:08.120]  Truck stop shower is only five dollars.
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:10.440]  I think I'll go with that instead.
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.440]  I'm going with that instead.
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:16.520]  I love it when it all runs together.
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:19.120]  You gotta think about where you've been.
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:24.160]  All of the places and the weird looking faces.
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:26.480]  I love it when it never ends.
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:32.040]  Wake me when this song ends.
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:48.160]  And the windows here become the paintings.
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:50.480]  And the windows here become the paintings.
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:54.000]  With the glass and the world as the canvas.
[01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:57.000]  It's a peaceful diameter.
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:59.320]  It's like two gentle arms.
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:02.520]  It's hugging me and there's a four points chair.
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:04.320]  That hangs on two chains.
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:06.640]  There's an old back seat of a jeep.
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:10.840]  I don't mind shooing the dogs off.
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:14.560]  To observe the world revolve.
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:18.440]  Observe the world revolve.
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:23.040]  Observe the world revolve.
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:38.880]  Sun goes to China.
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:41.800]  Sky comes alive and those paintings.
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:43.800]  A purple swirl.
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:47.480]  Lift up the glass and you climb into the color.
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:50.560]  Then you deeply breathe and absorb.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.200]  Deeply breathe and absorb.
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:56.600]  Well I'm here, I'm not there.
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:58.320]  You know there should be here.
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:01.200]  It would be nice if everywhere were here.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.880]  Then we would not have to leave or drive or fly.
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:08.480]  Or hurry real fast or decide.
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:12.960]  Hurry real fast or decide.
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:16.520]  Cause more than often I drive so much.
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:19.200]  It's like my ass is my feet.
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:23.360]  I see little black furry running dogs.
[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:26.400]  And I'm standing up in my seat.
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:29.800]  I'm standing up in my seat.
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:34.680]  To avoid sleep driving, crashing and dying.
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:36.680]  You gotta turn up the tune.
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:41.960]  Rest area next right is my salvation.
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:45.520]  Cause I'm running on the flumes.
