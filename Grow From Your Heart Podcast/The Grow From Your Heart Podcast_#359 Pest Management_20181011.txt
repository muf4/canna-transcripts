[00:00.000 --> 00:02.280]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:02.280 --> 00:06.240]  It's time for episode 359 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:06.240 --> 00:09.720]  This episode of the show is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:09.720 --> 00:14.240]  If you need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company, and
[00:14.240 --> 00:18.800]  you can find them at dankseed.store.
[00:18.800 --> 00:21.880]  I like to start the podcast off by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[00:21.880 --> 00:26.960]  Today I'm taking dabs of Bubble Jack Full Spectrum Extract from Fuego Extracts.
[00:26.960 --> 00:30.760]  I really love the flavor and aroma of this concentrate.
[00:30.760 --> 00:35.640]  It smells like Jack Harrier and bubble gum, and when you dab it, it leaves a sweet, soft
[00:35.640 --> 00:40.240]  bubble gum flavor on your mouth that just lingers for a long time, and the high goes
[00:40.240 --> 00:41.440]  straight to the head.
[00:41.440 --> 00:43.660]  I really like this concentrate.
[00:43.660 --> 00:45.820]  One thing I am going to complain about is the packaging.
[00:45.820 --> 00:47.880]  These little plastic jars get stuck.
[00:47.880 --> 00:50.620]  The Fuego jars get stuck every time I buy them.
[00:50.620 --> 00:52.400]  It is a pain in the ass.
[00:52.400 --> 00:57.240]  When they are putting the jar inside of a black bag with a drawstring, kind of like
[00:57.240 --> 01:02.400]  a little tiny crown royal bag, the jar has stickers on it to indicate the brand and the
[01:02.400 --> 01:03.400]  strain.
[01:03.400 --> 01:06.480]  The little black bag has a bunch of fibers that come off of it.
[01:06.480 --> 01:11.440]  So now I've got a jar that looks like it's got long black hairs hanging off of it.
[01:11.440 --> 01:12.900]  I don't like that at all.
[01:12.900 --> 01:13.900]  It's unappealing.
[01:13.900 --> 01:14.940]  There's no need for that bag.
[01:14.940 --> 01:16.760]  It's a waste of material.
[01:16.760 --> 01:20.820]  It's another step in the packaging process, and it is completely useless.
[01:20.820 --> 01:25.140]  Then after they've put the jar in that bag, they place that bag inside of another box,
[01:25.140 --> 01:29.600]  which slides into another box, which is all beautifully decorated and well-labeled.
[01:29.600 --> 01:30.680]  It is a lot of packaging.
[01:30.680 --> 01:34.880]  I'm sure most of that packaging is because of the Colorado compliance laws, but I would
[01:34.880 --> 01:37.360]  like to see less packaging from the concentrate companies.
[01:37.360 --> 01:39.480]  I feel like I throw away a lot of packaging.
[01:39.480 --> 01:40.880]  All right, you guys.
[01:40.880 --> 01:42.040]  So let me be completely clear.
[01:42.040 --> 01:43.540]  The concentrate is amazing.
[01:43.540 --> 01:45.960]  The bubble jack full spectrum extract tastes great.
[01:45.960 --> 01:46.960]  The high is perfect.
[01:47.060 --> 01:51.140]  My only complaint is with the packaging, and that is not just Fuego.
[01:51.140 --> 01:54.440]  I just happen to be using Fuego products today when I'm talking about this.
[01:54.440 --> 01:58.980]  A lot of the companies are using too much packaging, and I understand it's Colorado
[01:58.980 --> 01:59.980]  law.
[01:59.980 --> 02:00.980]  We've got to be compliant.
[02:00.980 --> 02:01.980]  I get it.
[02:01.980 --> 02:04.940]  I just wish there was a way we could do this more efficiently and more environmentally
[02:04.940 --> 02:05.940]  friendly.
[02:05.940 --> 02:06.940]  All right, you guys.
[02:06.940 --> 02:07.940]  Let's move forward with the show.
[02:07.940 --> 02:10.360]  This is going to be another grow lesson.
[02:10.360 --> 02:14.420]  This is going to be the seventh lesson in a long series of grow lessons.
[02:14.420 --> 02:19.180]  In this episode, I want to talk about planning your integrated pest management.
[02:19.180 --> 02:21.300]  Everybody likes to think they will not get bugs.
[02:21.300 --> 02:24.060]  Everybody likes to say that's not going to happen to me, but guess what?
[02:24.060 --> 02:25.060]  It will.
[02:25.060 --> 02:29.620]  And the only way you can prevent it is by starting an integrated pest management system
[02:29.620 --> 02:33.300]  while you're planning your grow, while you're setting up your grow, and having it in place
[02:33.300 --> 02:37.660]  before you ever introduce plants into your grow environment.
[02:37.660 --> 02:40.420]  Now let's talk a little bit about integrated pest management.
[02:40.420 --> 02:43.640]  What is the goal of our integrated pest management system?
[02:43.860 --> 02:48.280]  The ultimate goal is to keep our garden free of pests and bugs.
[02:48.280 --> 02:53.200]  A good spot to start would be knowing how to identify the bugs we are looking for and
[02:53.200 --> 02:55.000]  the damage that they will leave.
[02:55.000 --> 02:58.840]  Now what insects are we going to find in our cannabis garden?
[02:58.840 --> 03:03.300]  The most common problem we are going to find is spider mites.
[03:03.300 --> 03:05.280]  Spider mites are very small.
[03:05.280 --> 03:09.720]  You are very unlikely to see a spider mite unless you flip over a leaf and look at it
[03:09.720 --> 03:11.400]  and do some investigating.
[03:11.400 --> 03:14.300]  What you will see is spider mite damage.
[03:14.300 --> 03:17.880]  If you've got a leaf that looks like somebody has just been taking a needle and poking little
[03:17.880 --> 03:21.680]  dots in that leaf, or something's been sticking its fangs in there and sucking the juice out
[03:21.680 --> 03:25.120]  of those little spots, that is spider mite damage.
[03:25.120 --> 03:28.420]  Learn how to identify spider mite damage.
[03:28.420 --> 03:32.700]  If you see damage on a leaf, pull that leaf off, flip it upside down and look at the underside
[03:32.700 --> 03:33.700]  of the leaf.
[03:33.700 --> 03:37.800]  Along the main vein of that leaf, tucked right up against that vein, you will see spider
[03:37.800 --> 03:39.740]  mites and spider mite eggs.
[03:39.740 --> 03:42.540]  Those little dots you see, those are spider mite eggs.
[03:42.540 --> 03:45.700]  Those little itty bitty dots that are moving, those are the spider mites.
[03:45.700 --> 03:46.780]  They are there.
[03:46.780 --> 03:48.580]  It is time to treat for them.
[03:48.580 --> 03:52.260]  Depending on what cycle of growth you are in, treating for spider mites can be very
[03:52.260 --> 03:53.260]  easy.
[03:53.260 --> 03:56.260]  It can also be kind of a pain in the ass later in flower.
[03:56.260 --> 04:01.000]  If you learn how to identify spider mite damage and learn how to identify spider mites, finding
[04:01.000 --> 04:06.100]  the problem early and correcting it should not be a problem before it gets out of hand.
[04:06.100 --> 04:10.500]  Another pest that is very common in the garden and very easy to identify because of its damage
[04:10.500 --> 04:12.260]  is a thrip.
[04:12.260 --> 04:16.380]  A lot like a spider mite, the thrips like to suck the juice out of our plants.
[04:16.380 --> 04:20.780]  After they do this, they leave a little trail of gooey stuff called honeydew on the leaves.
[04:20.780 --> 04:25.700]  If you see a little trail of silvery, shiny, shimmery stuff left on your lower leaves,
[04:25.700 --> 04:27.860]  you probably have thrips.
[04:27.860 --> 04:32.300]  If we become familiar with what thrip damage looks like, we can identify the problem sooner
[04:32.300 --> 04:35.760]  and that makes it really easy to eradicate our problems.
[04:35.760 --> 04:40.580]  So my point is, knowing what to look for will be seriously advantageous when it comes
[04:40.580 --> 04:43.600]  to treating for a pest problem.
[04:43.600 --> 04:46.920]  Another common pest you're going to run into is the whitefly.
[04:46.920 --> 04:47.920]  What does a whitefly look like?
[04:47.920 --> 04:50.600]  It looks like a little piece of ash just flying around.
[04:50.600 --> 04:51.600]  Just a little whitefly.
[04:51.600 --> 04:52.960]  It'll start off with two of them.
[04:52.960 --> 04:54.800]  Then the next day you'll see 200 of them.
[04:54.800 --> 04:57.680]  Then the next day you'll see 2,000 of them.
[04:57.680 --> 05:02.960]  Whiteflies multiply rapidly, but once you see them, they are easy to get rid of if you
[05:02.960 --> 05:05.540]  understand how to combat them.
[05:05.540 --> 05:10.700]  So the very first step of an integrated pest management system is learning to identify
[05:10.700 --> 05:14.500]  the damage caused by common garden pests.
[05:14.500 --> 05:18.480]  Once we know how to identify the problems, then we can identify the pest, then we can
[05:18.480 --> 05:22.300]  decide on the course of action to treat that problem.
[05:22.300 --> 05:26.880]  Also, it is very important to treat for the correct pest.
[05:26.880 --> 05:32.100]  Some pesticides will work on a broad spectrum of pests, but if you're using specific pesticides
[05:32.180 --> 05:38.180]  or if you're using specific predatory pests, you do need to use the correct method of attack.
[05:38.180 --> 05:43.020]  In today's market, we can't afford to spend money on a product that does not specifically
[05:43.020 --> 05:48.980]  attack our problem, and also we can't spend time applying a product or releasing predators
[05:48.980 --> 05:52.820]  that are not going to get in there and eradicate our problems.
[05:52.820 --> 05:59.340]  So learn how to identify the signs, then identify the actual pest, then we can dial in and attack
[05:59.340 --> 06:01.300]  to eradicate our problem.
[06:01.300 --> 06:05.860]  Now let's talk about a few ways we can prepare our grow and prevent pests from entering our
[06:05.860 --> 06:07.700]  new garden.
[06:07.700 --> 06:11.760]  Cleanliness is a huge factor when it comes to keeping bugs out of our garden.
[06:11.760 --> 06:14.960]  Everything that goes in that garden is taken in there by you.
[06:14.960 --> 06:19.720]  You travel in and out of there, you take things in and out, it is your responsibility to control
[06:19.720 --> 06:22.360]  what goes in and out of that grow.
[06:22.360 --> 06:28.040]  One way to prevent contaminating your garden is to have dedicated garden clothes.
[06:28.040 --> 06:31.960]  Don't come from a hike, don't come from the grow store, don't come from work, don't go
[06:31.960 --> 06:34.560]  from wherever you are into your grow room.
[06:34.560 --> 06:37.040]  Have specific garden clothes.
[06:37.040 --> 06:40.280]  Change your clothes, change your shoes, change your hat.
[06:40.280 --> 06:43.120]  Don't take your daily clothing into your grow room.
[06:43.120 --> 06:44.420]  Who knows what's on you?
[06:44.420 --> 06:48.600]  Maybe you've been petting a dog, maybe the dog was outside leaning against the tree,
[06:48.600 --> 06:50.080]  maybe that tree had aphids.
[06:50.080 --> 06:54.280]  That dog came in, rubbed up against your leg, you and the dog spent a minute together scratching
[06:54.280 --> 06:58.200]  on each other, then you went to the grow, you just took those aphids from the tree to
[06:58.200 --> 06:59.960]  the dog into your garden.
[06:59.960 --> 07:01.780]  Try to prevent that sort of thing.
[07:01.780 --> 07:03.360]  Be very careful.
[07:03.360 --> 07:05.760]  I've got dreadlocks down to my knees.
[07:05.760 --> 07:10.120]  I wrap my dreadlocks up in a specific hat before I go into any grow.
[07:10.120 --> 07:15.080]  If you've got dreadlocks or long hair, I suggest you put it in a hat of some sort, maybe a
[07:15.080 --> 07:16.400]  hairnet, whatever it takes.
[07:16.400 --> 07:18.160]  My hair would not fit in a hairnet.
[07:18.160 --> 07:20.480]  I wrap my dreads in a big bun on top of my head.
[07:20.480 --> 07:23.200]  I wrap that in a piece of material that wraps real tight.
[07:23.200 --> 07:26.320]  Then I slide a dreadlock hat over that so I'm double wrapped.
[07:26.320 --> 07:28.120]  Nothing will get in, nothing will get out.
[07:28.120 --> 07:32.240]  I won't transfer any problems from grow to grow or room to room.
[07:32.240 --> 07:36.080]  If you've got dreadlocks or long hair, I highly recommend you keep it wrapped up maybe in
[07:36.080 --> 07:39.660]  a hairnet or something similar, maybe a dread hat just where it's contained in there and
[07:39.660 --> 07:40.840]  not exposed.
[07:40.840 --> 07:44.720]  That way you can prevent moving spider mites around through your hair.
[07:44.720 --> 07:48.640]  Some of you guys with the big beards, you may want to consider a beard net also, not
[07:48.640 --> 07:52.880]  just to prevent the bugs from getting into our hair, but also to prevent our hair from
[07:52.880 --> 07:53.960]  sticking to the buds.
[07:53.960 --> 07:57.240]  Nobody wants to buy a bud with a big hair in it.
[07:57.240 --> 08:00.320]  Change your clothes, keep your hair tied up, and then let's get back to that dog I was
[08:00.320 --> 08:01.320]  talking about.
[08:01.320 --> 08:03.720]  I don't recommend having pets in the grow room.
[08:03.720 --> 08:07.160]  I see a lot of pictures of people with their dog or their cat in the grow room talking
[08:07.160 --> 08:10.360]  about it's their guard dog or their mascot.
[08:10.360 --> 08:13.120]  That's cool if you want to do that, but I don't recommend it.
[08:13.120 --> 08:17.280]  Like I said earlier, your dog or your cat goes outside, it rolls around in the dirt,
[08:17.280 --> 08:20.360]  it rolls around in the bushes, it just goes everywhere.
[08:20.360 --> 08:22.040]  Who knows what it's getting into?
[08:22.200 --> 08:27.440]  Maybe it walked up right up against a plant that was covered in spider mites and you had
[08:27.440 --> 08:28.440]  no idea.
[08:28.440 --> 08:32.680]  Now that dog is in your garden rubbing up against your plants, guess what?
[08:32.680 --> 08:34.720]  Free spider mites for everybody.
[08:34.720 --> 08:36.920]  I don't recommend having a pet in the grow.
[08:36.920 --> 08:39.580]  If you insist, do your thing, that is your grow.
[08:39.580 --> 08:44.880]  But in my opinion, that is a huge risk for bringing bugs into your garden.
[08:44.880 --> 08:48.440]  Another thing I would recommend is that if you've got an outdoor grow and an indoor
[08:49.040 --> 08:53.080]  don't bring your tools from that outdoor grow into your indoor grow environment.
[08:53.080 --> 08:54.920]  You may be bringing problems.
[08:54.920 --> 08:58.680]  And sometimes I know I sound like I might just be paranoid, but it's better to be paranoid
[08:58.680 --> 09:00.880]  than to make stupid mistakes.
[09:00.880 --> 09:04.240]  Now as long as you're changing your clothes, you're keeping your hair clean, you're keeping
[09:04.240 --> 09:07.600]  your shoes and your equipment clean, and you're not letting your dog or your friends in your
[09:07.600 --> 09:11.720]  grow room, there shouldn't be a way for any pests to get into this grow.
[09:11.720 --> 09:15.500]  You may have some cracks in the walls, there may be gaps in your building, that's always
[09:15.500 --> 09:18.880]  going to happen, but we're not going to drag them in there on our own.
[09:18.880 --> 09:21.500]  If they find a way in, we will deal with that.
[09:21.500 --> 09:25.160]  Now once you're certain you've minimized the opportunity for pests to enter your grow through
[09:25.160 --> 09:29.940]  your own doing, we need to think about treating the clones that come into our grow before
[09:29.940 --> 09:32.140]  they are introduced to population.
[09:32.140 --> 09:35.620]  Wherever your clones come from, if it's your best friend, if it's a dispensary, if it's
[09:35.620 --> 09:40.820]  some guy on Instagram, wherever they came from, treat them as if they are contaminated
[09:40.820 --> 09:43.160]  with some sort of pest issue.
[09:43.160 --> 09:47.600]  Never introduce clones into your general population without some sort of quarantine
[09:47.600 --> 09:48.640]  period.
[09:48.640 --> 09:51.360]  If your room is brand new, you don't have bugs.
[09:51.360 --> 09:54.320]  Why take plants in there that have bugs on them?
[09:54.320 --> 09:58.320]  We can treat those plants before we take them into our main grow room.
[09:58.320 --> 10:02.540]  If you've got a room with plants going, why would you want to introduce a plant with bugs
[10:02.540 --> 10:06.280]  on it into that room to contaminate the entire grow?
[10:06.280 --> 10:11.420]  If you get clones from anybody, isolate them, quarantine them, investigate them, get a jeweler's
[10:11.420 --> 10:16.140]  loop and go over the leaves and see if you can see any signs of bugs on the top or bottoms
[10:16.140 --> 10:17.460]  of those leaves.
[10:17.460 --> 10:21.940]  If you see any pests, now you have to decide if you want to keep that clone or if you're
[10:21.940 --> 10:26.500]  going to treat it and try to eradicate that problem before you introduce that clone to
[10:26.500 --> 10:28.360]  your general population.
[10:28.360 --> 10:31.860]  If I got a clone that had bugs on it, I would probably throw it away unless it were some
[10:31.860 --> 10:34.380]  super elite cut that I could never get again.
[10:34.380 --> 10:35.740]  Why start with problems?
[10:35.740 --> 10:38.900]  I wouldn't even allow that to make it past quarantine.
[10:38.900 --> 10:41.980]  If it looked like it was clean, I would still probably treat it.
[10:41.980 --> 10:45.940]  I would treat it with whatever pest management system I have decided to work with.
[10:45.940 --> 10:51.020]  If I'm using sprays and oils, I would heavily treat it with multiple oils several times.
[10:51.020 --> 10:53.460]  It would probably spend a week in quarantine.
[10:53.460 --> 10:55.740]  The first day it would get blasted with something.
[10:55.740 --> 10:58.100]  On day three, it would get blasted with something different.
[10:58.100 --> 10:59.540]  On day five, something different.
[10:59.540 --> 11:00.540]  They were going to look at it.
[11:00.540 --> 11:04.140]  If I feel like it's safe and clean, it may enter general population on day seven, or
[11:04.140 --> 11:08.360]  it may get treated one more time depending on how it looks to me.
[11:08.360 --> 11:12.600]  If I were working in a facility that did not use spray applications, I would put that
[11:12.600 --> 11:16.640]  plant in an isolated area with enough light and living conditions to survive for a few
[11:16.640 --> 11:20.560]  days, and then I would start heavily applying beneficial insects.
[11:20.560 --> 11:22.840]  I would build up a colony of predators on there.
[11:22.840 --> 11:25.800]  Hopefully they would go through and eat anything that was causing me a problem, and by day
[11:25.800 --> 11:30.360]  seven I would be safe to enter that clone into general population.
[11:30.360 --> 11:34.640]  But honestly, if I got a clone and it was contaminated, I probably would just destroy
[11:34.640 --> 11:35.640]  it.
[11:35.640 --> 11:37.440]  It wouldn't even make it past the inspection stage.
[11:37.520 --> 11:39.320]  It wouldn't even get into my grow.
[11:39.320 --> 11:44.680]  So as a grower, it is your responsibility to check incoming clones and check them thoroughly,
[11:44.680 --> 11:45.920]  no matter where they came from.
[11:45.920 --> 11:49.520]  If it came from your best friend, if it came from a dispensary, if it came from somebody
[11:49.520 --> 11:52.280]  on the internet, it is your responsibility.
[11:52.280 --> 11:56.240]  You cannot blame anybody for giving you a clone with bugs.
[11:56.240 --> 11:57.240]  That is your fault.
[11:57.240 --> 11:59.160]  It is not their fault.
[11:59.160 --> 12:02.640]  So treat any incoming plants as if they are contaminated.
[12:02.640 --> 12:06.600]  Isolate them, treat them, and continue to monitor them until you are certain the problem
[12:06.680 --> 12:09.480]  is not there or has been eradicated.
[12:09.480 --> 12:15.000]  Now another very common way for people to get garden pests is through store-bought soil
[12:15.000 --> 12:16.320]  or soilless mix.
[12:16.320 --> 12:21.680]  A lot of people try to blame specific brands for being infested with specific bugs.
[12:21.680 --> 12:24.320]  I find that to be inaccurate.
[12:24.320 --> 12:25.600]  Think about it this way.
[12:25.600 --> 12:28.240]  Brand A is made in one area in California.
[12:28.240 --> 12:31.280]  Brand B is probably made in another area of California.
[12:31.280 --> 12:34.800]  And Brand C, we'll just say that it's manufactured in Colorado.
[12:34.800 --> 12:36.360]  So all three of those brands are made.
[12:37.120 --> 12:39.200]  And they're all shipped to a warehouse.
[12:39.200 --> 12:43.200]  Sometimes these warehouses store their soil in pallets outdoors.
[12:43.200 --> 12:47.560]  Now if one of those pallets had a little bit of bugs in it, they started thriving in that
[12:47.560 --> 12:49.360]  one pallet of soil.
[12:49.360 --> 12:51.420]  Then they moved over to the next pallet.
[12:51.420 --> 12:53.000]  Then they moved over to the next pallet.
[12:53.000 --> 12:59.000]  Now they are in Brands A, B, and C. There is no way to blame a specific soil company
[12:59.000 --> 13:00.000]  for giving you bugs.
[13:00.000 --> 13:03.800]  It was probably the warehouse in which all of those pallets were stored is where your
[13:03.800 --> 13:05.000]  bugs came from.
[13:05.000 --> 13:09.960]  So let's try to get away from blaming a specific brand for having specific bugs in there.
[13:09.960 --> 13:12.440]  That's unfair and probably inaccurate.
[13:12.440 --> 13:17.320]  But it is a fact that our soil does come with bugs quite frequently.
[13:17.320 --> 13:20.160]  A lot of times you'll notice this when you're transplanting.
[13:20.160 --> 13:23.040]  You'll stick your hand in there and a little bug will just fly right up.
[13:23.040 --> 13:24.760]  It's usually a fungus gnat or a white fly.
[13:24.760 --> 13:26.800]  It'll just fly right up out of the soil.
[13:26.800 --> 13:27.960]  You know they're there.
[13:27.960 --> 13:32.840]  Now it's time to start thinking about how you're going to treat for those pests.
[13:32.840 --> 13:36.960]  Other times you don't see those soil-borne pests until the first time you water.
[13:36.960 --> 13:38.520]  You just potted all those pots.
[13:38.520 --> 13:41.000]  You got a whole bag worth of soil worth of up pots done.
[13:41.000 --> 13:42.280]  You feeling really good about life.
[13:42.280 --> 13:43.640]  You got the grow room all organized.
[13:43.640 --> 13:44.640]  You mix up your nutrients.
[13:44.640 --> 13:48.840]  You go to water and that first batch of water that hits that soil, you see little bugs come
[13:48.840 --> 13:49.840]  flying out.
[13:49.840 --> 13:50.840]  Those are fresh bugs.
[13:50.840 --> 13:52.240]  They came fresh with the soil.
[13:52.240 --> 13:56.560]  They're not a big deal as long as we know how to identify the insect and we know how
[13:56.560 --> 14:00.000]  to properly treat for that problem.
[14:00.000 --> 14:02.600]  Treating for soil-bound pests is very easy.
[14:03.360 --> 14:07.560]  You can either purchase predator insects that will get in there and eat that specific pest
[14:07.560 --> 14:12.120]  or we can mix up a root drench, which is a basic pesticide and you mix it with water
[14:12.120 --> 14:15.600]  and then you water that into the plants just like you would when you normally water.
[14:15.600 --> 14:19.340]  Then that pesticide gets down in there in the root zone and then it will eradicate any
[14:19.340 --> 14:21.240]  pests that are in there.
[14:21.240 --> 14:25.760]  The things you're most commonly going to find in soil are going to be white flies.
[14:25.760 --> 14:31.440]  You'll probably find some fungus gnats and I quite often have found thrips in my soil.
[14:31.440 --> 14:33.640]  Just know that your soil may have bugs in it.
[14:33.640 --> 14:36.200]  Be aware, be looking and be prepared.
[14:36.200 --> 14:41.840]  Once you see some pests, identify them, then start thinking about eradication strategies.
[14:41.840 --> 14:46.200]  I do plan on giving you options for eradication strategies, but I'm not going to tell you
[14:46.200 --> 14:47.440]  what to do.
[14:47.440 --> 14:50.800]  There are countless options and variables when it comes to deciding your integrated
[14:50.800 --> 14:55.920]  pest management, but I want to give you guidance to let you decide and modify your own pest
[14:55.920 --> 15:00.360]  management system to where it fits with your grow style, with your grow environment, and
[15:00.360 --> 15:02.480]  also it's got to fit your budget.
[15:02.480 --> 15:05.640]  I'm going to give you a good guideline on how to take care of pests in your garden,
[15:05.640 --> 15:11.640]  but it is up to you to implement and modify these practices to work for you.
[15:11.640 --> 15:15.120]  We've covered most of the ways that we are going to introduce pests into a grow.
[15:15.120 --> 15:18.880]  Let's talk about the other ways pests are going to find their way into the grow.
[15:18.880 --> 15:21.960]  They're going to come in through your venting and your ducting.
[15:21.960 --> 15:25.920]  If you have any spots that are not sealed up, a spider mite or a little bug could just
[15:25.920 --> 15:27.280]  wiggle its way right through there.
[15:27.280 --> 15:29.240]  It's going to smell that sweet ganja plant.
[15:29.240 --> 15:32.240]  It's going to feel that warmth from the light and it's going to go, man, I want to be in
[15:32.240 --> 15:33.240]  there.
[15:33.240 --> 15:35.800]  It's going to just go that way and then it's going to tell all of its friends, hey bro,
[15:35.800 --> 15:38.720]  I found a way in, and they're just going to start parading in.
[15:38.720 --> 15:42.160]  Any cracks or gaps in your structure need to be sealed.
[15:42.160 --> 15:46.600]  If you can find a gap or a crack or a hole of some sort, put some caulk in there, put
[15:46.600 --> 15:51.280]  some tape over it, seal it up super tight so that the bugs cannot get in there.
[15:51.280 --> 15:55.240]  It's ideal to have a completely sealed room, but I understand that that is not always a
[15:55.240 --> 15:56.960]  viable option.
[15:56.960 --> 16:01.560]  Since we do have the opportunity to get bugs in there, our next step is to have a way to
[16:01.560 --> 16:04.840]  monitor and indicate the presence of pests.
[16:04.840 --> 16:09.640]  And the easiest way and most affordable and cost-effective way to do that is first by
[16:09.640 --> 16:10.640]  scouting.
[16:10.640 --> 16:16.080]  You need to spend time every day looking through your garden to see if you see any signs of
[16:16.080 --> 16:18.960]  bugs or bug damage.
[16:18.960 --> 16:20.400]  Scouting for bugs is free.
[16:20.400 --> 16:21.400]  It just takes time.
[16:21.400 --> 16:25.040]  Depending on the size of your grow, this could take anywhere from five minutes to a full
[16:25.040 --> 16:26.040]  hour.
[16:26.120 --> 16:27.400]  But it is important work.
[16:27.400 --> 16:30.600]  Put on some good music, get in the zone, and scout for pests.
[16:30.600 --> 16:35.240]  Train everybody in the grow how to identify signs of pests and also teach them how to
[16:35.240 --> 16:37.740]  identify which pests they're dealing with.
[16:37.740 --> 16:42.520]  If you do discover pests, have a way to mark the plant and also mark on paper where it
[16:42.520 --> 16:43.760]  was in the facility.
[16:43.760 --> 16:47.800]  You probably have row numbers or room numbers, or if it's just a home grow, just plant number
[16:47.800 --> 16:49.400]  three or the plant in the middle.
[16:49.400 --> 16:52.800]  Just kind of mark down roughly where it is and then start thinking of a strategy.
[16:52.800 --> 16:56.800]  If you're not the one in charge of pest management, make sure you report that to the person above
[16:56.800 --> 16:57.800]  you.
[16:57.800 --> 16:58.800]  So just make a note of it.
[16:58.800 --> 17:02.120]  Write down what you found, what it looks like, what pest you think it is, and then start
[17:02.120 --> 17:04.880]  doing research on how do we eradicate that pest.
[17:04.880 --> 17:06.760]  Start coming up with options.
[17:06.760 --> 17:08.320]  So scouting for bugs is free.
[17:08.320 --> 17:12.320]  You walk the rows, you turn the leaves upside down, you look, you look low in the canopy,
[17:12.320 --> 17:15.160]  you look high in the canopy, you look around.
[17:15.160 --> 17:16.720]  Feel free to pull a few leaves off.
[17:16.720 --> 17:19.720]  If you can't get a good look, reach in there, pop off a few leaves.
[17:19.720 --> 17:20.920]  Look at those under your scope.
[17:20.920 --> 17:22.520]  See if you see anything.
[17:23.240 --> 17:27.120]  You should be scouting for pests on a regular basis with some sort of a strategy.
[17:27.120 --> 17:31.640]  Now while you're out scouting for pests, you should check your yellow sticky cards.
[17:31.640 --> 17:36.160]  Every grow should have yellow sticky cards and they should be checked frequently and
[17:36.160 --> 17:39.040]  changed frequently as well.
[17:39.040 --> 17:41.520]  Yellow sticky cards are exactly what I'm saying.
[17:41.520 --> 17:43.140]  They're little yellow cards.
[17:43.140 --> 17:47.200]  They're about four inches by four inches or maybe four inches by six inches and they are
[17:47.200 --> 17:49.000]  bright yellow and they are sticky.
[17:49.000 --> 17:52.400]  They've got a disgusting glue on them that if you touch it, it's going to take all day
[17:52.400 --> 17:53.800]  to get that stuff off of you.
[17:53.800 --> 17:56.280]  Don't get one stuck to your elbow when you're working in the grow.
[17:56.280 --> 17:58.320]  If you've done it, you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[17:58.320 --> 18:00.560]  When you do it, you'll go, ah, that's what he meant.
[18:00.560 --> 18:03.680]  But you should have yellow sticky traps all over the grow.
[18:03.680 --> 18:08.400]  I like to put yellow sticky traps low down by the soil so that if I get any soil bound
[18:08.400 --> 18:11.320]  pests coming up out of the dirt, I get indicators of that.
[18:11.320 --> 18:13.800]  I like to put yellow sticky traps low in the canopy.
[18:13.800 --> 18:17.280]  So if I get any low flying stuff, I get indicators of that.
[18:17.280 --> 18:20.760]  I'll put stuff at the top of the canopy and then I'll also put stuff up near the light
[18:20.760 --> 18:24.160]  so that if anything flies into it, I get an indicator of that.
[18:24.160 --> 18:28.480]  And that is a really easy way to find out that you have got insects.
[18:28.480 --> 18:30.720]  Bugs love those yellow sticky traps.
[18:30.720 --> 18:32.560]  They say, wow, look how bright that is.
[18:32.560 --> 18:34.160]  That's a leaf that is weak.
[18:34.160 --> 18:37.580]  That's a leaf that's got a weak surface that I can get in there and really start sucking
[18:37.580 --> 18:39.320]  the juice out of without a lot of effort.
[18:39.320 --> 18:40.320]  I want to go to that.
[18:40.320 --> 18:44.320]  So the bugs run to that yellow sticky trap and they go, ah, shit, this is yellow sticky
[18:44.320 --> 18:45.320]  trap.
[18:45.320 --> 18:46.320]  I'm stuck here.
[18:46.360 --> 18:49.920]  We get up in the morning and we get to find out what kind of bugs were messing around
[18:49.920 --> 18:54.040]  in the garden, having a party while we were at home trying to get some rest.
[18:54.040 --> 18:58.240]  Yellow sticky traps are really affordable and they are a really early indicator of the
[18:58.240 --> 18:59.880]  presence of pests.
[18:59.880 --> 19:03.360]  So hang up your sticky traps, check them on a daily basis.
[19:03.360 --> 19:08.320]  If you start seeing things stuck to them, investigate what that pest is and treat accordingly.
[19:08.320 --> 19:12.920]  Then hang up fresh sticky traps and see if that problem has gone away or if it has gotten
[19:12.920 --> 19:15.040]  worse or if anything new pops up.
[19:15.040 --> 19:18.360]  But if you're going to use the yellow sticky traps, there has to be some sort of method
[19:18.360 --> 19:19.440]  to your madness.
[19:19.440 --> 19:23.840]  You have to hang them strategically, you have to check them and you have to replace them.
[19:23.840 --> 19:27.280]  And if you see something, you have to react accordingly.
[19:27.280 --> 19:29.920]  So now we have two methods of finding bugs in our garden.
[19:29.920 --> 19:34.360]  We can use our own vision from scouting and then we can use yellow sticky traps to assist
[19:34.360 --> 19:35.360]  us.
[19:35.360 --> 19:40.080]  Our next step is to learn to use our integrated pest management system to continue to prevent
[19:40.080 --> 19:46.480]  infestations and we also need to learn what to do if a pest infestation should occur.
[19:46.480 --> 19:51.000]  In a strategic pest management system, it's always wise to have preventative measures
[19:51.000 --> 19:52.060]  in place.
[19:52.060 --> 19:55.680]  Why wait until we've got bugs to start treating for bugs?
[19:55.680 --> 20:00.760]  Let's make it uncomfortable and undesirable for the pests we know may arrive.
[20:00.760 --> 20:04.800]  Now before we talk about options, let's talk a little bit about ethics.
[20:04.800 --> 20:10.960]  You can choose predator bugs, you can choose organic sprays, you can choose harsh chemical
[20:10.960 --> 20:16.960]  sprays, whatever you choose to treat your garden is up to you.
[20:16.960 --> 20:19.860]  I encourage you to use something safe.
[20:19.860 --> 20:21.000]  Is it safe to you?
[20:21.000 --> 20:22.700]  Is it safe to the consumer?
[20:22.700 --> 20:23.980]  Is it safe to your pets?
[20:23.980 --> 20:26.920]  And is it overall safe to our environment?
[20:26.920 --> 20:30.760]  If you're going to smoke it yourself, spray whatever you are comfortable with spraying
[20:30.760 --> 20:31.760]  on your garden.
[20:31.760 --> 20:33.440]  That's yours, you can do whatever you want.
[20:33.440 --> 20:37.040]  I probably don't want to smoke it if you sprayed it with a few things, but if it's
[20:37.040 --> 20:42.000]  yours and you're sure it's not going anywhere, you can treat it however you are comfortable.
[20:42.000 --> 20:46.320]  If you have other consumers that are going to consume your product, keep their health
[20:46.320 --> 20:48.140]  and safety in mind.
[20:48.140 --> 20:51.080]  Not everybody is a young, healthy person.
[20:51.080 --> 20:56.400]  Some people may have underlying health issues that may be exacerbated by a pesticide or
[20:56.400 --> 20:58.960]  an essential oil or a botanical oil.
[20:58.960 --> 21:03.960]  Keep other people in mind if you are going to share, sell, or dispense your product in
[21:03.960 --> 21:05.560]  any sort of way.
[21:05.560 --> 21:09.920]  Then of course, please make sure that your pest management system is environmentally
[21:09.920 --> 21:10.920]  friendly.
[21:10.920 --> 21:15.760]  We also need to keep in mind the long-term effects of whatever we choose to use.
[21:15.760 --> 21:21.080]  Beneficial mites will have a long-term environmental effect, but it is a much gentler effect than
[21:21.080 --> 21:24.000]  if we went outside and sprayed harsh chemicals.
[21:24.000 --> 21:25.720]  Think about long-term.
[21:25.720 --> 21:30.720]  Think about exposure, not just to the plant, the environment, the soil, your neighbor's
[21:30.720 --> 21:32.680]  gardens, but also to yourself.
[21:32.680 --> 21:36.800]  You've got to apply those chemicals or pesticides or botanical oils.
[21:36.800 --> 21:39.560]  Think about if they're going to harm you over time.
[21:39.560 --> 21:42.980]  Also think about, this is something we don't think about often enough here, but I'm trying
[21:42.980 --> 21:44.880]  to gear myself more toward.
[21:44.880 --> 21:49.360]  Think about the ethics of the company that makes the products you are using.
[21:49.360 --> 21:50.760]  Does that company care?
[21:50.760 --> 21:52.280]  Do they care about the environment?
[21:52.280 --> 21:53.600]  Do they care about people?
[21:53.600 --> 21:55.120]  Do they care about cannabis?
[21:55.120 --> 21:57.480]  Are they opposed to cannabis?
[21:57.480 --> 22:01.560]  There are some companies out there that make products that are available at the hydro store
[22:01.560 --> 22:07.040]  that are completely opposed to cannabis and cannabis legalization.
[22:07.040 --> 22:10.520]  Why would we buy those products to support those people?
[22:10.520 --> 22:15.960]  So when it comes to selecting a pesticide, understand the company, understand the product
[22:15.960 --> 22:20.920]  you're buying, understand the active ingredient, and understand the effects of that ingredient
[22:20.920 --> 22:22.500]  in the long-term.
[22:22.500 --> 22:26.200]  Understand what it's doing to yourself, understand what it's doing to your consumers, and try
[22:26.200 --> 22:29.060]  to understand what it does to the environment.
[22:29.060 --> 22:32.420]  And then really think about if that's something you can support, if that is something you
[22:32.420 --> 22:35.540]  would be proud to say you did, if that is something you would stand behind.
[22:35.540 --> 22:39.040]  And if you're proud of it, if you can support it, and you'd put your signature on it, go
[22:39.040 --> 22:40.440]  ahead and use that product.
[22:40.440 --> 22:42.040]  Do what you're comfortable with.
[22:42.040 --> 22:44.400]  So now let's talk a little bit more about preventative.
[22:44.400 --> 22:46.360]  That's where I was headed with all of that.
[22:46.360 --> 22:47.520]  Preventative measures.
[22:47.520 --> 22:51.460]  It's okay to start treating for a pest problem before you see a pest problem.
[22:51.460 --> 22:54.440]  Why wouldn't we go ahead and make an undesirable environment?
[22:54.440 --> 22:56.260]  What are easy ways to do that?
[22:56.260 --> 22:59.740]  An easy way to do that is to already apply beneficial insects.
[22:59.740 --> 23:04.860]  Why not start a colony of beneficial bugs in our garden before the bad bugs even have
[23:04.860 --> 23:06.380]  a chance to take hold?
[23:06.380 --> 23:11.120]  You can start getting your persimilis, your swarskies, whatever you decide to use in there.
[23:11.120 --> 23:12.220]  Do a little bit of research.
[23:12.220 --> 23:14.660]  Make sure that you order the proper bugs that work for your environment.
[23:14.660 --> 23:19.020]  Your temperature and humidity will play a huge factor in the bugs that you need to order.
[23:19.020 --> 23:20.160]  But get some predators in there.
[23:20.160 --> 23:25.040]  Get the army established and get them started before the bad guys can even get started.
[23:25.040 --> 23:29.280]  So another route you can take is by spraying pesticide applications.
[23:29.280 --> 23:34.240]  You can use your essential oils, your botanical oils, or you can use your light or heavy chemical
[23:34.240 --> 23:35.900]  sprays, whatever you choose to use.
[23:35.900 --> 23:40.440]  You can start applying them before you see an insect infestation.
[23:40.440 --> 23:44.080]  That way if a bug does try to creep down the ducting, it jumps on the plant and it goes,
[23:44.080 --> 23:45.080]  oh, fuck that.
[23:45.080 --> 23:46.080]  I don't want to be here at all.
[23:46.080 --> 23:47.080]  And it just tries to run.
[23:47.080 --> 23:48.460]  It doesn't invite its friends.
[23:48.460 --> 23:53.160]  You can create that undesirable environment before you even get an infestation.
[23:53.160 --> 23:56.740]  I would start with a schedule and a strategy.
[23:56.740 --> 24:00.340]  Decide that you're going to spray every so often and then decide that you need to rotate
[24:00.340 --> 24:04.660]  your products this frequently and then set a schedule and a routine.
[24:04.660 --> 24:08.060]  And then if you see anything, you can step up your game accordingly.
[24:08.060 --> 24:11.480]  We'll talk more about scheduling and strategy a little later.
[24:11.480 --> 24:15.760]  Now let's say we have been scouting and we have been doing our preventative sprays and
[24:15.760 --> 24:18.520]  now we have discovered some pests.
[24:18.520 --> 24:19.960]  Now how do we treat them?
[24:19.960 --> 24:21.040]  What's the first step?
[24:21.040 --> 24:24.500]  The first step is to correctly identify your pest.
[24:24.500 --> 24:28.680]  On a commercial scale, it would save a lot of time and energy to treat for the correct
[24:28.680 --> 24:30.700]  pest the first time.
[24:30.700 --> 24:34.160]  So the first step is to correctly identify our pest.
[24:34.160 --> 24:38.520]  The next step is to think about how do we want to treat this problem.
[24:38.520 --> 24:40.040]  Do we want to use predators?
[24:40.040 --> 24:42.200]  Do we want to use horticultural oils?
[24:42.200 --> 24:43.880]  Do we want to use botanical sprays?
[24:43.880 --> 24:47.120]  Do we want to get in there with essential oils or do we want to step up our game and
[24:47.120 --> 24:50.720]  start using light pesticides or maybe even stronger pesticides?
[24:50.720 --> 24:52.400]  This is where we have to think about that.
[24:52.400 --> 24:56.840]  A lot of the essential oils and the hippie products aren't going to get rid of a strong
[24:56.840 --> 24:57.840]  infestation.
[24:57.840 --> 25:01.240]  That's where you'll need to step up to a mild pesticide.
[25:01.240 --> 25:03.400]  A lot of the pesticides are organic.
[25:03.400 --> 25:05.720]  A lot of those will work for you.
[25:05.720 --> 25:09.180]  If you've got a serious infestation and you don't want to deal with some organic stuff,
[25:09.180 --> 25:11.560]  you can step your way up to more harsh chemicals.
[25:11.680 --> 25:15.520]  Like I said, those are toxic and they become dangerous and you need to think about the
[25:15.520 --> 25:18.480]  ethics of what you are giving to other people.
[25:18.480 --> 25:22.320]  Now if you're trying to stay more organic, if you're doing a TLO sort of setup, you can
[25:22.320 --> 25:24.240]  introduce predator bugs.
[25:24.240 --> 25:25.680]  Predators are expensive.
[25:25.680 --> 25:29.200]  You also have to have specific insects to battle specific insects.
[25:29.200 --> 25:32.480]  You can't just release one thing and expect it to go take care of any bug that you may
[25:32.480 --> 25:33.480]  get.
[25:33.480 --> 25:34.920]  So predators are an option.
[25:34.920 --> 25:36.480]  They're also time consuming.
[25:36.480 --> 25:38.280]  You have to get out there and let them go.
[25:38.280 --> 25:39.280]  You have to apply.
[25:39.360 --> 25:42.400]  They either come in satchets or they come in a bottle with like a little spout.
[25:42.400 --> 25:43.680]  You got to let them out somehow.
[25:43.680 --> 25:45.580]  They have to be dispersed through the garden.
[25:45.580 --> 25:49.160]  So they are time consuming, but they are organic.
[25:49.160 --> 25:50.800]  They are 100% organic.
[25:50.800 --> 25:54.160]  You're not applying anything to the garden that's going to change the flavor.
[25:54.160 --> 25:57.480]  You're not putting any chemicals on there that may make anybody else sick and they are
[25:57.480 --> 25:58.960]  completely safe.
[25:58.960 --> 26:02.840]  So you found a pest, you identified the pest, you've done some research on products that
[26:02.840 --> 26:07.920]  will help you get rid of that pest, either beneficial bugs or pesticide sprays.
[26:07.920 --> 26:10.960]  And now you've decided to apply that product.
[26:10.960 --> 26:16.660]  Now keep in mind, if we apply the same product to a pest too many times, those bugs will
[26:16.660 --> 26:18.660]  develop a resistance.
[26:18.660 --> 26:21.580]  So you'll see a bug, you'll treat it, it'll look like it's gone.
[26:21.580 --> 26:22.580]  It'll come back.
[26:22.580 --> 26:24.180]  You'll spray for that bug again.
[26:24.180 --> 26:25.180]  You'll think it's gone.
[26:25.180 --> 26:26.840]  A couple of weeks later, it'll come back.
[26:26.840 --> 26:28.320]  You'll spray twice as hard.
[26:28.320 --> 26:30.860]  It'll come back and it won't show up for a long time.
[26:30.860 --> 26:34.040]  When it does come back, you won't be able to spray it down with the product you've been
[26:34.040 --> 26:35.040]  using before.
[26:35.040 --> 26:36.320]  You'll have to switch it up.
[26:36.360 --> 26:40.980]  So to prevent that, I recommend using multiple modes of attack.
[26:40.980 --> 26:44.960]  And don't forget that if the pesticides work together and don't cause a chemical problem
[26:44.960 --> 26:49.680]  together and don't disrupt the plant health, you can mix more than one pesticide in a tank
[26:49.680 --> 26:50.680]  together.
[26:50.680 --> 26:52.740]  I've done an episode about it titled Tank Mix.
[26:52.740 --> 26:55.420]  Don't be afraid to mix multiple products together.
[26:55.420 --> 26:59.260]  So you mix your products, you give it a good shake, you apply to your plants.
[26:59.260 --> 27:04.020]  I would say give it two or three days, then apply a different mix.
[27:04.020 --> 27:08.640]  And then if you still see the presence of bugs, apply a different mix.
[27:08.640 --> 27:12.720]  Don't go at it with the same product over and over because they will develop a resistance
[27:12.720 --> 27:13.720]  to it.
[27:13.720 --> 27:16.940]  Earlier, I said we would talk about scheduling and strategy.
[27:16.940 --> 27:22.480]  So let's talk about a more scheduled and detailed integrated pest management strategy.
[27:22.480 --> 27:28.760]  Here is a quick rundown of my scheduling and my strategy for pest management in a grow.
[27:28.760 --> 27:33.480]  Everything I mentioned is approved by the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division and
[27:33.940 --> 27:35.660]  the Colorado Department of Ag.
[27:35.660 --> 27:40.540]  I cannot apply a pesticide that is on the banned list or that has not been approved
[27:40.540 --> 27:42.740]  for use in a commercial grow.
[27:42.740 --> 27:46.940]  So everything I'm using is approved by the state of Colorado.
[27:46.940 --> 27:52.980]  Now to start my pest management system, every Monday I apply a specific pesticide regimen
[27:52.980 --> 27:54.820]  to all of my vegetative plants.
[27:54.820 --> 28:00.240]  My small veg, my large veg, my mother plants, and the clones that are rooted and in pots,
[28:00.240 --> 28:02.980]  they all get sprayed with a pesticide.
[28:02.980 --> 28:06.940]  Depending on the size of the plant, I may spray them with a little more potent mix.
[28:06.940 --> 28:08.440]  I may spray them with a lighter mix.
[28:08.440 --> 28:09.980]  I may spray with just one product.
[28:09.980 --> 28:12.360]  I may mix up multiple products at a time.
[28:12.360 --> 28:15.460]  But every Monday, those plants are getting treated.
[28:15.460 --> 28:19.740]  I also write down exactly what I sprayed on each plant.
[28:19.740 --> 28:22.700]  That way next week, I know I can switch my pesticide.
[28:22.700 --> 28:26.900]  I can spray something different next week to prevent a resistance.
[28:26.900 --> 28:30.180]  Now I know that my plants have got a protective barrier.
[28:30.200 --> 28:34.600]  There's a little protection going on to prevent from getting pests in the room.
[28:34.600 --> 28:40.120]  If you're using lighter sprays, if you're using botanical oils or essential oils, you
[28:40.120 --> 28:43.120]  may want to up your spray regimen to twice a week.
[28:43.120 --> 28:47.840]  If those things don't stick around very long, you may want to apply them more frequently.
[28:47.840 --> 28:52.600]  So have a weekly spray schedule in place and try to switch up your products so that you
[28:52.600 --> 28:56.520]  can prevent your pests from building any type of resistance.
[28:56.540 --> 29:01.300]  Now when you're in there applying the sprays, spray the undersides of the leaves.
[29:01.300 --> 29:04.420]  You'll notice the spider mites are on the underside of the leaves.
[29:04.420 --> 29:05.900]  Why not spray there?
[29:05.900 --> 29:10.140]  So start at the bottom of the plant and start spraying the underside of the leaf and work
[29:10.140 --> 29:11.860]  your way up the plant to the top.
[29:11.860 --> 29:14.460]  And you will saturate the entire grow this way.
[29:14.460 --> 29:18.500]  Try to cover all of the plants just to the point of runoff, right to when they start
[29:18.500 --> 29:19.500]  dripping.
[29:19.500 --> 29:22.880]  Specific products will have specific guidelines, but I recommend you spray right to where they
[29:22.880 --> 29:23.900]  start running off.
[29:23.900 --> 29:26.260]  You just want to saturate that plant.
[29:26.260 --> 29:29.080]  Don't leave any desirable space for a pest.
[29:29.080 --> 29:32.240]  So get in there and spray once, maybe twice a week.
[29:32.240 --> 29:35.600]  And you can do this throughout the vegetative stage.
[29:35.600 --> 29:39.480]  Now once we start approaching the flower phase, we need to think about what we are going to
[29:39.480 --> 29:42.560]  do for pest management during the bloom phase.
[29:42.560 --> 29:49.320]  In a typical commercial grow, I would generally apply approved pesticides until day 14 or
[29:49.320 --> 29:51.320]  15 of the flowering phase.
[29:51.320 --> 29:56.060]  I may go in there the first day of the third week and hit that room one last time if I've
[29:56.080 --> 30:00.600]  had any problems just to make sure those bugs aren't coming back.
[30:00.600 --> 30:03.920]  If you don't have any buds building yet, if you're just starting to get bud set, you should
[30:03.920 --> 30:08.000]  be okay with one final spray if you were selective with your products.
[30:08.000 --> 30:12.200]  Now if you haven't seen any bugs, you can taper off your spray applications earlier
[30:12.200 --> 30:17.120]  in flower and that's when we can start to introduce our beneficial and predator insects.
[30:17.120 --> 30:20.560]  Now the beneficial insects work just like pesticide applications.
[30:20.560 --> 30:24.100]  You have to reapply them at specified intervals.
[30:24.140 --> 30:28.280]  Most of the vendors that provide live bugs are willing to set you up on a schedule to
[30:28.280 --> 30:31.320]  where you will receive the same order every week.
[30:31.320 --> 30:33.360]  That way you can rely on it coming.
[30:33.360 --> 30:34.360]  It'll show up at the grow.
[30:34.360 --> 30:35.760]  You'll say, hey look, they're here.
[30:35.760 --> 30:38.040]  And then you've got to hang them because they're right there in your face.
[30:38.040 --> 30:39.040]  You can't forget.
[30:39.040 --> 30:40.040]  You can't put it off.
[30:40.040 --> 30:41.040]  They're alive.
[30:41.040 --> 30:44.520]  So that's a good way to get yourself on a good regimen and a good schedule of getting
[30:44.520 --> 30:46.120]  the live bugs out.
[30:46.120 --> 30:50.920]  So in a commercial grow, we basically work with spray applications until we see bud set.
[30:50.920 --> 30:53.160]  That's when we switch to the predator bugs.
[30:53.220 --> 30:57.620]  Make sure to taper off your spray application to where it doesn't destroy your predator bugs.
[30:58.620 --> 31:01.980]  Now if you've been releasing your predators on your schedule and you start seeing spider
[31:01.980 --> 31:06.540]  mites, you can order fast release predators that will get in there and eat those spider
[31:06.540 --> 31:07.540]  mites for you.
[31:07.540 --> 31:10.660]  They come in a bottle with a little spout and they are hungry.
[31:10.660 --> 31:14.220]  You turn the spout, you open that bottle, you point that bottle at a leaf and the spider
[31:14.220 --> 31:17.300]  mite, the predator mites that are in there start marching out.
[31:17.300 --> 31:20.380]  They go and destroy the spider mite colonies.
[31:20.600 --> 31:24.400]  So if you start seeing an infestation during flower and you're already putting out the
[31:24.400 --> 31:28.320]  bugs, you just need to step up the bugs and try to ride it out through flower.
[31:28.320 --> 31:33.960]  You can defoliate, take any spider mite infested leaves out of there, get them out of the room.
[31:33.960 --> 31:36.320]  Don't go into a different room after that.
[31:36.320 --> 31:40.040]  Don't drag the bugs from the dirty room to the clean room on your clothes.
[31:40.040 --> 31:43.400]  Try to start the day working in the clean room and then work your way through to the
[31:43.400 --> 31:48.480]  dirtiest rooms and try to work on the bug infested room very last if that is an option.
[31:48.580 --> 31:52.260]  So if you've done everything correctly, you won't see spider mites late in flower, but
[31:52.260 --> 31:57.220]  if you do and you're using beneficial insects, you've got the option to apply more beneficial
[31:57.220 --> 31:58.220]  insects.
[31:58.220 --> 32:01.700]  I don't recommend spraying flowering plants with anything.
[32:01.700 --> 32:04.940]  Once you have bud set, everything you spray on there, you will taste it.
[32:04.940 --> 32:08.400]  If not in the flower, you will taste it in the concentrates.
[32:08.400 --> 32:13.540]  So if you do notice a presence of bugs late in flower in your flowering room and you were
[32:13.540 --> 32:19.160]  using beneficial insects as your pest management system, or if you're using sprays as your
[32:19.160 --> 32:23.580]  pest management system, it is time to step your game up in your vegetative areas.
[32:23.580 --> 32:27.800]  We need to eliminate the pests in veg because if you've got them in flower, they are in
[32:27.800 --> 32:32.680]  veg and we need to start getting rid of them and having a clean grow before we move stuff
[32:32.680 --> 32:37.080]  into the flower room because like I've mentioned, once we get past week three, we can't really
[32:37.080 --> 32:38.280]  spray those plants.
[32:38.280 --> 32:42.220]  We can only treat them with bugs and that takes time to build up.
[32:42.240 --> 32:46.680]  So let's focus on getting the plants clean and pest free before we even move them to
[32:46.680 --> 32:48.320]  that stage.
[32:48.320 --> 32:50.600]  A lot of people try to focus on the flowering plants.
[32:50.600 --> 32:52.280]  They want to get those pest free.
[32:52.280 --> 32:53.520]  Those are on their way out.
[32:53.520 --> 32:54.980]  Let's focus on the moms.
[32:54.980 --> 32:58.200]  Let's go all the way to the beginning and get the mother plants very clean.
[32:58.200 --> 33:00.180]  Let's get the source material clean.
[33:00.180 --> 33:02.300]  Let's work on keeping the clones clean.
[33:02.300 --> 33:04.420]  Let's learn how to get the veg room immaculate.
[33:04.420 --> 33:07.840]  So that way when we move into the flower room, we don't have to battle bugs.
[33:07.840 --> 33:09.040]  We don't have to battle pests.
[33:09.040 --> 33:13.580]  We can focus on building those fat juicy buds and delicious trichomes that we're all
[33:13.580 --> 33:14.580]  after.
[33:14.580 --> 33:17.680]  Now, one thing I do recommend is write down all of your sprays.
[33:17.680 --> 33:21.300]  If you were working in a commercial grow, you were required to write down all of your
[33:21.300 --> 33:22.300]  sprays.
[33:22.300 --> 33:23.900]  You have to write down the date, the time.
[33:23.900 --> 33:28.820]  You also have to write down the name of every product and the EPA number of every product
[33:28.820 --> 33:31.400]  and the amount of every product that you applied.
[33:31.400 --> 33:35.040]  You have to write down the REI of each product that you applied.
[33:35.040 --> 33:37.640]  You have to write down the lot number of plants.
[33:37.640 --> 33:40.940]  There's a lot of documenting to be done in a commercial grow.
[33:40.940 --> 33:44.900]  I recommend you do the same thing in your private grow just for peace of mind.
[33:44.900 --> 33:46.740]  It's always nice to have records.
[33:46.740 --> 33:50.700]  And if you do end up working in a commercial grow, you've already got experience writing
[33:50.700 --> 33:52.340]  down what you've been using.
[33:52.340 --> 33:58.820]  Now, I'm sure there are a lot of people that will not agree with my pesticide spray application
[33:58.820 --> 33:59.820]  regimen.
[33:59.820 --> 34:01.060]  That is just fine with me.
[34:01.060 --> 34:03.540]  I like that people have different opinions.
[34:03.540 --> 34:06.680]  That's just the method that I use in a commercial environment.
[34:06.720 --> 34:08.940]  That's what has been proven to work for me.
[34:08.940 --> 34:12.660]  It has been proven to be cost-effective and it is something that I can train other employees
[34:12.660 --> 34:16.140]  to do on a repeatable basis.
[34:16.140 --> 34:20.380]  Just like all other aspects of growing cannabis, the options for integrated pest management
[34:20.380 --> 34:21.420]  are endless.
[34:21.420 --> 34:25.300]  And as long as it's making you happy, as long as you are satisfied with the results, keep
[34:25.300 --> 34:26.300]  doing it.
[34:26.300 --> 34:30.580]  All right, podcast world, that is my quick talk on integrated pest management.
[34:30.580 --> 34:32.660]  I know I didn't recommend any products.
[34:32.660 --> 34:34.620]  I didn't recommend any specific vendors.
[34:34.640 --> 34:36.800]  I did not recommend any brands.
[34:36.800 --> 34:41.560]  My goal was to give you an idea of how to start your own custom-tailored integrated
[34:41.560 --> 34:43.000]  pest management.
[34:43.000 --> 34:46.520]  Now you know what to expect and you've got a few options on how to prevent and how to
[34:46.520 --> 34:47.760]  treat those things.
[34:47.760 --> 34:53.600]  Now you can customize that program to work for your grow, your budget, and your style.
[34:53.600 --> 34:57.520]  If you've got any questions or comments about this podcast, I would love to hear from you.

[35:16.860 --> 35:19.580]  Ladies and gentlemen, I made it 35 minutes without taking a break.
[35:19.580 --> 35:21.060]  My voice is burning out.
[35:21.060 --> 35:23.660]  I want to thank you for hanging out for this long episode.
[35:23.660 --> 35:25.860]  I'll be back Monday with a fresh new episode.
[35:25.860 --> 35:28.800]  I want to give a huge shout out to Stabby McStabberson.
[35:28.800 --> 35:32.100]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
