[00:23.280 --> 00:28.040]  host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me. This
[00:28.040 --> 00:32.000]  episode of the podcast is brought to you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.

[00:46.440 --> 00:57.320]  Grow From Your Heart podcast. Yo, what's up podcast world? It's time for episode 312.
[00:57.320 --> 01:00.420]  Thanks again for joining me. You know, I like to start these episodes off by letting you
[01:00.420 --> 01:06.820]  know what I'm smoking on. Today I'm taking dabs of Apollo 13 live batter from our friends
[01:06.820 --> 01:12.260]  at Apothecary Farms in Colorado Springs. You guys, this concentrate smells amazing. I always
[01:12.260 --> 01:17.360]  thought Apollo 13 had sort of a funky smell. And when they made it into a concentrate,
[01:17.360 --> 01:22.300]  it definitely brought out that funky smell. There is sort of like a rotten mangoes or
[01:22.300 --> 01:27.380]  a filthy apricot with some dirty peaches on it. It's got a rotten fruit sort of a smell,
[01:27.380 --> 01:31.740]  sort of like you're making some, some bum wine, some prison hooch. That's like the very
[01:31.740 --> 01:36.380]  start of that funky fermentation process. And honestly, I love that smell. There's just
[01:36.380 --> 01:41.340]  something about fermented funk that I kind of enjoy. And this really hits that note.
[01:41.340 --> 01:45.060]  When you smoke it, that fermented funk flavor doesn't come through. It comes through more
[01:45.060 --> 01:49.980]  like a sweet, funky sort of a thing. And I actually enjoyed that. And then the head high
[01:49.980 --> 01:55.420]  is just tremendous. You guys, my head is spinning from this Apollo. So Apollo 13 from Apothecary
[01:55.420 --> 01:59.460]  Farms is what I'm dabbing today. I hope you're joining me. I hope you're smoking something
[01:59.460 --> 02:03.940]  delicious. Let me know what you're smoking. Send me a tweet. It's at GFYH podcast. I would
[02:03.940 --> 02:05.740]  love to hear from you.
[02:05.740 --> 02:10.500]  All right, podcast world, let's get this show on the road. Where do we want to start? How
[02:10.500 --> 02:14.580]  about some good news? If you've been listening to the show for a while, you've been hearing
[02:14.580 --> 02:19.260]  me talk about making more lemon Jeffrey and more golden goat feminized seeds. That's right.
[02:19.260 --> 02:23.940]  I am the creator of the strain lemon Jeffrey. And I also made the golden goat into feminized
[02:23.940 --> 02:28.740]  seeds. I did not invent or create the golden goat. I simply put it into feminized seeds.
[02:28.740 --> 02:33.100]  Please don't give me credit for that. The lemon Jeffrey, however, is my creation. Those
[02:33.100 --> 02:37.300]  are both made from a reversed golden goat. I take a girl golden goat plant, I reverse
[02:37.300 --> 02:42.460]  it, I turn it into a boy that makes female pollen. Then I put that pollen on more golden
[02:42.460 --> 02:46.300]  goat plants. And then I put that pollen on more lemon skunk plants. And then I create
[02:46.300 --> 02:50.820]  golden goat feminized seeds and I create lemon Jeffrey feminized seeds. Lemon Jeffrey is
[02:50.820 --> 02:57.660]  one of my most popular strains. It is a super sativa with a super lemon flavor. And it harvests
[02:57.660 --> 03:02.180]  very heavy harvest. It has been a huge hit and I haven't made seeds of that in several
[03:02.180 --> 03:07.340]  years. So it is time to make more lemon Jeffrey seeds. Those will be available in about 90
[03:07.340 --> 03:10.980]  days. So make sure you check back with the hella dank seed company at dank seed store
[03:10.980 --> 03:16.100]  in about 90 days. I'm recording this at the very start of May. We've got all of May and
[03:16.100 --> 03:19.940]  all of June for them to grow. And then it's going to take me a little bit to get the seeds
[03:19.940 --> 03:24.860]  pulled out of the buds and everything packaged. So you're looking into July. So hopefully
[03:24.860 --> 03:29.420]  the middle or the end of July, there will be golden goat lemon Jeffrey seeds available
[03:29.420 --> 03:34.460]  about 90 days you guys be patient. Bear with me. All right, you know, I'm gonna make an
[03:34.460 --> 03:37.700]  Instagram post and I'm gonna talk about it on the show. So don't worry, you won't be
[03:37.700 --> 03:42.020]  left out and I will not let you forget about it. Also speaking of seeds and speaking of
[03:42.020 --> 03:46.620]  the hella dank seed company, I recently put a name to one of my new crosses. That's right.
[03:46.620 --> 03:50.900]  I've had a cross that has needed a name for quite some time. I've been racking my brain
[03:50.900 --> 03:55.340]  and bugging all of my friends about what to name it. I have finally settled on a name.
[03:55.340 --> 03:59.740]  The strain that I've been trying to name of course was Stardog to Arise. There were many
[03:59.740 --> 04:06.460]  great options. I narrowed it down to Starbreaker because it was Stardog to Arise and Arise
[04:06.460 --> 04:09.860]  is Daybreaker and golden goat. So there was Daybreaker in there. So I wanted to call it
[04:09.860 --> 04:16.420]  Starbreaker. Also, somebody in my Instagram live feed dropped the name Starstruck. As
[04:16.420 --> 04:19.620]  soon as they said Starstruck, I think I knew that that was going to be the name but I wanted
[04:19.620 --> 04:24.400]  to hesitate because I got super excited. But since they said that, I've known since then
[04:24.400 --> 04:29.300]  that the name of that strain was Starstruck. So Stardog to Arise is officially called Starstruck
[04:29.300 --> 04:33.380]  you guys. Thanks for all the support. I want to thank everybody on my social media that
[04:33.380 --> 04:37.020]  pitched in with name ideas. I want to thank everybody on my Instagram live feed that helped
[04:37.020 --> 04:40.740]  with name ideas. Big shout out to the guy who actually threw out the name. I'm not sure
[04:40.740 --> 04:44.540]  if he wants his name said on a podcast. And also a big shout out to Adam Ill for helping
[04:44.540 --> 04:51.100]  me narrow down and decide the final names. So you guys, Stardog to Arise is officially
[04:51.100 --> 04:55.500]  known as Starstruck and guess what? You can get it at dankseed.store.
[04:55.500 --> 05:00.700]  Alright, I've only got one more thing I want to talk about before we start getting into
[05:00.700 --> 05:04.620]  some cannabis talk and start reading some emails. I want to talk about what I got to
[05:04.620 --> 05:09.620]  do on Thursday night. You guys, if you listen to the podcast, if you know anything about
[05:09.620 --> 05:15.220]  me, you know that I am a huge reggae fan. And you know that Morgan Heritage is my favorite
[05:15.220 --> 05:20.240]  reggae band. It takes me a lot to commit to something and say that something is my favorite.
[05:20.240 --> 05:25.340]  To fill that spot really takes a lot and Morgan Heritage is my favorite reggae band, alive
[05:25.340 --> 05:31.300]  or dead, any country, any planet. Morgan Heritage is my favorite reggae band. They are fucking
[05:31.300 --> 05:36.500]  amazing. They've been on fire for the past two years. So let me talk about Morgan Heritage
[05:36.500 --> 05:42.100]  for just a minute. They are mainly three brothers. There used to be a sister in the band, but
[05:42.100 --> 05:45.860]  she's not traveling with them anymore. Shout out to Miss Una Morgan, I hope you're well.
[05:45.860 --> 05:50.940]  But there is Mr. Mojo Morgan, who is a big smiley dude with big thick dreadlocks. He's
[05:50.940 --> 05:57.180]  a big thick man. He plays percussion and backup vocals and does a little kind of some rappy
[05:57.180 --> 06:01.980]  type stuff. A lot of reggae songs have that perfect opportunity for a rap verse. And that's
[06:01.980 --> 06:05.820]  always where Mr. Mojo drops in. He walks up to the front of the stage, throws out a nice
[06:05.820 --> 06:10.620]  clean rap and then walks right back to his percussion and keeps going. Also in the band
[06:10.620 --> 06:16.220]  is Gramps Morgan. Gramps Morgan is another giant man with giant dreadlocks and a giant
[06:16.220 --> 06:23.120]  smile, also a giant heart and a giant voice. Gramps Morgan plays keyboards. When it's his
[06:23.120 --> 06:27.740]  turn to sing, he walks out to the front of the stage and he sings with this super low
[06:27.740 --> 06:34.560]  voice and this big giant smile. And the ladies just go crazy for Gramps Morgan and that giant
[06:34.560 --> 06:39.160]  voice that comes out of that man. Sometimes he'll like look at the crowd like, all right,
[06:39.160 --> 06:43.040]  if you don't quit screaming, I can't sing because nobody can hear me. And he loves it.
[06:43.040 --> 06:47.600]  He milks the crowd. He's he's got huge stage presence and he knows it. And he plays it
[06:47.600 --> 06:52.600]  very well. So that's Gramps Morgan. He he's a ladies man. He makes the ladies go crazy.
[06:52.600 --> 06:58.000]  I also love the way the man sings. He's got such a soulful style to him. He's always wearing
[06:58.000 --> 07:03.520]  his sunglasses indoors because I'm sure his eyes are super red. He's just a big, happy,
[07:03.520 --> 07:08.840]  joyful Rasta man. Next to them is his brother, Peter Morgan. Peter Morgan is kind of a small
[07:08.840 --> 07:16.720]  guy. He's not as huge as the other two, but he's got a huge presence. He has a silky smooth
[07:16.720 --> 07:21.200]  Michael Jackson reggae voice. And I think it's awesome. He sings the high parts. You've
[07:21.200 --> 07:25.520]  got Gramps over there doing the lows, and then you got Peter up there doing the highs.
[07:25.520 --> 07:30.240]  And it just the way that it they, they contrast each other is perfect. They contrast, they
[07:30.240 --> 07:34.680]  harmonize, they match. It works so well. Also, there's a backup singer named Natasha that
[07:34.680 --> 07:40.320]  sounds a lot like Peter. They blend very well together. But Peter Morgan has this really
[07:40.320 --> 07:47.360]  great he's got a very neat accent. His patois accent is very thick. And it comes out very
[07:47.360 --> 07:52.720]  neat when he gets fired up and gets going. And he's so passionate. The three brothers
[07:52.720 --> 07:57.880]  and the backup singer Natasha together have such a great harmonious feel to them. They
[07:57.880 --> 08:02.040]  could come out and just sing without instruments. And I think it would be a great show. The
[08:02.040 --> 08:05.800]  Morgan brothers along with Una Morgan, their sister have been singing together since they
[08:05.800 --> 08:09.760]  were children. So they've got a really tight vibe to them. And they can just look at each
[08:09.760 --> 08:13.600]  other and know what songs are going to play. They don't even have to talk. And Natasha
[08:13.600 --> 08:18.200]  has been on tour with them for two or three years now. So she's really fallen and I see
[08:18.200 --> 08:22.880]  her finding her space. She knows little drum parts. Now there'll be drum fills that she
[08:22.880 --> 08:26.720]  does that she air drums to the fills. I've seen this band a lot you guys if you can't
[08:26.720 --> 08:30.720]  tell. But the vibe that this band brings is amazing because they're a family and they've
[08:30.720 --> 08:35.600]  been together for years and they just bring such a good family vibe and they're well rehearsed
[08:35.600 --> 08:40.760]  and their harmonies are so strong and Natasha has fallen in perfectly. I love it. Also,
[08:40.760 --> 08:46.320]  there's another singer that joins them. Gramps Morgan's son, Jamiri Morgan is an up and
[08:46.320 --> 08:50.360]  coming reggae star. He's got an album out. He comes and sings a couple of songs with
[08:50.360 --> 08:55.560]  them. Jamiri is always great. But they would be awesome without the band is what I said
[08:55.560 --> 09:00.880]  a moment ago. But they do bring an amazing backup band. They bring a bass player who
[09:00.880 --> 09:06.000]  is Toots's grandson. It's Toots Hibbert's grandson. Their drummer, I'm not sure his
[09:06.000 --> 09:11.440]  name. He is an awesome drummer. He's kind of you could call him maybe the Tony Royster,
[09:11.440 --> 09:15.640]  or maybe the Tony Royster Jr. of reggae music. He looks like Tony Royster and he plays with
[09:15.640 --> 09:20.200]  that aggressive movement and that nonstop action and he makes a bunch of great funny
[09:20.200 --> 09:25.080]  faces which I really love in a drummer. Their guitar player is great. In a reggae band,
[09:25.080 --> 09:28.240]  you don't really need a show off of a guitar player. You need a guy that can keep a solid
[09:28.240 --> 09:32.080]  rhythm and then throw down a solo when it's needed. And the guy they've got does that
[09:32.080 --> 09:35.600]  perfectly right now. He's been on tour with them for quite a while. He's recorded with
[09:35.600 --> 09:41.360]  them. They fit together so well. They've got a keyboard player, same story as the guitarist,
[09:41.360 --> 09:44.640]  you just need a guy that can hold the rhythm and remember all of the songs and all of the
[09:44.640 --> 09:49.280]  changes and pull off a solo when needed. Their keyboard player can also throw out some rap
[09:49.280 --> 09:52.960]  verses. There are one or two songs where he'll grab a mic and run up to the front of the
[09:52.960 --> 09:56.880]  stage and spit out a rap verse and then run back to the keyboards and keep playing. So
[09:56.880 --> 10:01.480]  that's always fun when your guys can add more stuff to the show. So yeah, Morgan Heritage
[10:01.480 --> 10:06.240]  just has a bunch of great musicians, a bunch of great singers. They're great to go see.
[10:06.240 --> 10:09.840]  They bring such a good vibe. I always leave there with such good energy, and I always
[10:09.840 --> 10:15.840]  feel so refreshed. So Morgan Heritage was awesome. Also, the show was opened by... There
[10:15.840 --> 10:19.160]  were a couple acts that I didn't make it on time for. I had to leave work, I had to come
[10:19.160 --> 10:23.040]  home, get cleaned up, drive out of town and get there, and then parking took for freaking
[10:23.040 --> 10:25.800]  ever, and then getting into the show. So I missed a couple of the opening acts, but I
[10:25.800 --> 10:31.560]  did catch a new up and coming artist by the name of Anna Lee Brown, a very beautiful young
[10:31.560 --> 10:38.240]  lady from the islands who sang like an angel. She had some poppy reggae type stuff that
[10:38.240 --> 10:45.920]  I was really enjoying. Also, there was a group that was fronted by a man by the name of Fiji.
[10:45.920 --> 10:50.120]  I have never seen Fiji live until that night. I hadn't even heard that much of him until
[10:50.120 --> 10:56.920]  I saw Morgan Heritage was going on tour with them. Apparently, in Hawaii, Fiji is super
[10:56.920 --> 11:02.680]  popular. And apparently in Colorado Springs, we have a big gathering of people from Hawaii.
[11:02.680 --> 11:08.040]  There's a large community of Hawaiian or islanders in Colorado Springs. I was not aware of that
[11:08.040 --> 11:13.520]  because this guy Fiji and his brother Maui come to do reggae, and everybody from the
[11:13.520 --> 11:17.400]  islands and everybody from the island community that lives in Springs, they all filled the
[11:17.400 --> 11:22.000]  black sheep. You guys, I've never seen the black sheep this full for a Morgan Heritage
[11:22.000 --> 11:26.560]  show. Last year, when I went to see Morgan Heritage there, there were maybe 30 to 50,
[11:26.560 --> 11:31.280]  maybe 75 people in the entire club during Morgan Heritage's set. This time, the place
[11:31.280 --> 11:38.360]  was sold out. It was packed. People knew all of the words to Fiji and his friend Maui.
[11:38.360 --> 11:42.960]  They knew all the words to these guys' songs. They also knew all the words to Anna Lee Brown's
[11:42.960 --> 11:49.160]  songs. I have never heard of these bands before, but the islanders knew every word.
[11:49.160 --> 11:54.120]  I really like the way that guy Fiji gets down. That dude's got some soul. He's a big dude.
[11:54.120 --> 11:58.880]  He can sing high, he can sing low, and he also isn't afraid to get silly on stage. He'll
[11:58.880 --> 12:02.400]  crack himself up in the middle of a song and have some fun, which I really enjoy seeing
[12:02.400 --> 12:08.240]  an artist do. Another thing that I really enjoyed was the band that backs up Fiji and
[12:08.240 --> 12:15.240]  Maui. They come on stage and they play a pre-recorded Polynesian sounding soundtrack.
[12:15.240 --> 12:21.440]  I'm not sure what it was, honestly. I have never heard anything like that before. It
[12:21.440 --> 12:27.400]  was intense and it was very neat. But when that ends, the band goes into an instrumental
[12:27.400 --> 12:32.600]  and they play an instrumental, really intense instrumental jam while Fiji and Maui walk
[12:32.600 --> 12:39.040]  out onto the stage. And then once the singers get out onto the stage, they start doing a
[12:39.040 --> 12:44.280]  chant. And I don't want to sound offensive, but they say it's Hawaiian words and it's
[12:44.280 --> 12:53.200]  short sentences and it's just like, and then the crowd responds with just quick words back.
[12:53.200 --> 13:00.040]  And then the band did it again. And then the crowd responded back. And I have no idea what
[13:00.040 --> 13:06.360]  the fuck's going on, you guys. There were like 50 or 75 Polynesian people surrounding
[13:06.360 --> 13:11.560]  me and I was the tallest person in the front row by like an entire foot. And they all knew
[13:11.560 --> 13:14.320]  what was happening. And I was just kind of looking around like, wow, this is fucking
[13:14.320 --> 13:17.720]  amazing. It was really neat. It was really intense. I was also high as giraffe pussy.
[13:17.720 --> 13:22.320]  That may have had something to do with it. But this went on for two or three solid minutes.
[13:22.320 --> 13:26.840]  And then at the end of it, the guy ended it with like a really high one. He's like, and
[13:26.840 --> 13:31.440]  then they all did this really high pitch thing. And they stopped instantly like all
[13:31.440 --> 13:35.960]  together. And then the band took off playing reggae music. It was really intense. It was
[13:35.960 --> 13:40.080]  really beautiful. It was really neat. I've never seen anything like it. So if you get
[13:40.080 --> 13:44.360]  the chance you guys go see Fiji and Maui. They were fucking awesome and always go see
[13:44.360 --> 13:48.800]  Morgan heritage. Reggae music just makes me feel so good. If you can't tell by the enthusiasm
[13:48.800 --> 13:52.440]  in my voice when I talk about it, you guys, I need to take a dab I need to calm down a
[13:52.440 --> 13:56.880]  little bit. I also need to get some water. So I'm going to press pause. YouTube doesn't
[13:56.880 --> 13:59.800]  like it when I play reggae music, but I'm going to sneak in a couple of seconds of some
[13:59.800 --> 14:03.600]  Morgan heritage and then I'll be right back and we will talk about cannabis. Thanks for
[14:03.600 --> 14:04.360]  hanging out you guys.
[14:22.440 --> 14:23.720]  Oh,
[14:23.720 --> 14:26.760]  you know,
[14:26.760 --> 14:28.480]  more than
[14:28.480 --> 14:32.000]  you
[14:32.000 --> 14:33.000]  do.
[14:33.000 --> 14:34.000]  Oh,
[14:34.000 --> 14:35.000]  oh,
[14:35.000 --> 14:36.000]  oh,
[14:36.000 --> 14:37.000]  oh,
[14:37.000 --> 14:38.000]  oh,
[14:38.000 --> 14:39.000]  oh,
[14:39.000 --> 14:40.000]  oh,
[14:40.000 --> 14:41.000]  oh,
[14:41.000 --> 14:42.000]  oh,
[14:42.000 --> 14:43.000]  oh,
[14:43.000 --> 14:44.000]  Oh,
[14:44.000 --> 14:45.000]  now I lay me down to sleep.
[14:45.000 --> 14:52.160]  This world you keep for the sake of the children and future.
[14:52.160 --> 14:54.160]  Oh, yeah.
[14:54.160 --> 14:57.160]  Most hajjah we know we've all sinned,
[14:57.160 --> 15:00.160]  but leave us not to destroy all things
[15:00.160 --> 15:05.160]  for the sake of the children and future days.
[15:05.160 --> 15:06.160]  Oh, yeah.
[15:06.160 --> 15:10.160]  We hear the youth dem in Jamaica crying.
[15:10.160 --> 15:12.160]  Abwa war in the streets again.
[15:12.160 --> 15:16.160]  We hear the youth dem in Africa crying.
[15:16.160 --> 15:18.160]  Abwa war in the streets again.
[15:18.160 --> 15:22.160]  We hear the youth dem in the Middle East crying.
[15:22.160 --> 15:24.160]  Abwa war in the streets again.
[15:24.160 --> 15:27.160]  They tell you war and bondage is destruction for the children.
[15:27.160 --> 15:30.160]  Love is all we need for the children.
[15:30.160 --> 15:34.160]  Say, yin wuja, we need you now more than ever.
[15:34.160 --> 15:35.160]  Ever.
[15:35.160 --> 15:41.160]  Say, yin wuja, we need you now more than ever.
[15:41.160 --> 15:46.160]  Now the youth dem are bad, say too much blood are wrong.
[15:46.160 --> 15:48.160]  Too much blood are wrong.
[15:48.160 --> 15:50.160]  Now the youth dem are bad.
[15:50.160 --> 15:51.160]  All right, Podcast World, I am back.
[15:51.160 --> 15:54.160]  Thanks for hanging out and jamming some reggae music with me.
[15:54.160 --> 15:55.160]  Let's get into some emails.
[15:55.160 --> 15:57.160]  This first email comes from a listener.
[15:57.160 --> 15:59.160]  I'm not sure if he wants me to say his name.
[15:59.160 --> 16:01.160]  He clearly typed his name here in the email,
[16:01.160 --> 16:03.160]  but I am not going to say it just out of respect.
[16:03.160 --> 16:05.160]  He says, hey, Rasta Jeff, aloha.
[16:05.160 --> 16:06.160]  It's me.
[16:06.160 --> 16:07.160]  I live in Maui, Hawaii.
[16:07.160 --> 16:08.160]  How are you doing?
[16:08.160 --> 16:10.160]  Hope all is ivory.
[16:10.160 --> 16:13.160]  And first off, I hope all is well with you.
[16:13.160 --> 16:15.160]  It looks like the big island is erupting,
[16:15.160 --> 16:18.160]  and I hope you and your family and all of your people are safe.
[16:18.160 --> 16:23.160]  The email goes on to say, I made a big, big iRegenetics purchase on 420 during the sale,
[16:23.160 --> 16:26.160]  and I look forward to running your beans.
[16:26.160 --> 16:30.160]  I got an email from the Helladink Seed Bank about your blueberry cookies crosses.
[16:30.160 --> 16:33.160]  I haven't heard you talk about this on the podcast.
[16:33.160 --> 16:36.160]  I know you've had trouble in the past with genetic labeling with this company.
[16:36.160 --> 16:39.160]  I was wondering if this is your genetics.
[16:39.160 --> 16:41.160]  First off, yes, those are my genetics.
[16:41.160 --> 16:44.160]  Those are my blueberry cookies, feminized crosses.
[16:44.160 --> 16:47.160]  I've been talking about that a little bit on the show recently.
[16:47.160 --> 16:52.160]  Also, the Helladink Seed Company is not who was mislabeling my stuff.
[16:52.160 --> 16:54.160]  It was the Dink Team.
[16:54.160 --> 16:59.160]  The DinkTeam.com was getting bulk seeds and then just inventing a name for them.
[16:59.160 --> 17:02.160]  Strains that I hadn't named yet, they were just putting a name on it.
[17:02.160 --> 17:05.160]  So the Helladink Seed Company is totally cool.
[17:05.160 --> 17:07.160]  They have never done me wrong.
[17:07.160 --> 17:08.160]  They've never mislabeled anything.
[17:08.160 --> 17:10.160]  I fully support and endorse them.
[17:10.160 --> 17:12.160]  Those are my seeds that they've got.
[17:13.160 --> 17:16.160]  I no longer do business with the vendor that was changing my names.
[17:16.160 --> 17:21.160]  So when they run out of my seeds, they won't be able to advertise that they've got any of my products.
[17:21.160 --> 17:23.160]  They won't be able to give out any of my freebies.
[17:23.160 --> 17:29.160]  And they certainly will not be able to change any of my strain names or invent names for me.
[17:29.160 --> 17:33.160]  So I fully endorse and fully support the Helladink Seed Company.
[17:33.160 --> 17:35.160]  They've never done me wrong.
[17:35.160 --> 17:37.160]  Those are my blueberry cookies crosses on there.
[17:37.160 --> 17:39.160]  And also, they're going to go very quickly.
[17:39.160 --> 17:42.160]  So make sure you grab them while they are still available.
[17:42.160 --> 17:44.160]  Let's get back into the email.
[17:44.160 --> 17:45.160]  There is more.
[17:45.160 --> 17:48.160]  He says, I'd love to run all six of those crosses.
[17:48.160 --> 17:49.160]  I love the podcast, brother.
[17:49.160 --> 17:50.160]  Keep up the good work.
[17:50.160 --> 17:51.160]  I don't have a question.
[17:51.160 --> 17:54.160]  Then he says, wait, I do have a question.
[17:54.160 --> 17:55.160]  And it's a really good question, too.
[17:55.160 --> 17:57.160]  So I'm glad you came up with this.
[17:57.160 --> 18:02.160]  He says, do you map where you get the seeds off of the plant?
[18:02.160 --> 18:07.160]  Like, do you save main stock seeds, lower plant seeds, and upper cola seeds?
[18:07.160 --> 18:09.160]  Do you map where you take them off of the plant?
[18:09.160 --> 18:13.160]  Because I feel when I run main stock seeds, I get cup winners.
[18:13.160 --> 18:18.160]  My patient's feedback is that they are a lot more potent than bud seeds.
[18:18.160 --> 18:22.160]  If you do use the question on your podcast, you can use my real name.
[18:22.160 --> 18:23.160]  I don't mind.
[18:23.160 --> 18:24.160]  Cool, brother.
[18:24.160 --> 18:25.160]  Have a good night.
[18:25.160 --> 18:26.160]  Love you.
[18:26.160 --> 18:27.160]  From Robert Nash.
[18:27.160 --> 18:30.160]  Since he says we can use his full name, we'll sign off with his full name there.
[18:30.160 --> 18:32.160]  Hey, Robert Nash, thanks for the great email.
[18:32.160 --> 18:35.160]  I hope everything is well for you in Hawaii, bro.
[18:35.160 --> 18:36.160]  I seriously do.
[18:36.160 --> 18:37.160]  I've been watching videos.
[18:37.160 --> 18:39.160]  I've seen some updates.
[18:39.160 --> 18:40.160]  I hope you are safe.
[18:40.160 --> 18:41.160]  I hope your family is safe.
[18:41.160 --> 18:43.160]  I hope your garden is safe.
[18:43.160 --> 18:45.160]  I hope the whole island is well.
[18:45.160 --> 18:47.160]  I hope everything goes well for you guys.
[18:47.160 --> 18:51.160]  Everybody on the Morgan Heritage Tour, they were calling the tour the Island Vibes Tour.
[18:51.160 --> 18:53.160]  So everybody is an islander.
[18:53.160 --> 18:54.160]  And they brought such a great vibe.
[18:54.160 --> 18:56.160]  I feel like I owe you guys some love back.
[18:56.160 --> 18:59.160]  So much love, much respect out to the islands.
[18:59.160 --> 19:00.160]  I hope you guys are well.
[19:00.160 --> 19:02.160]  Let's answer the question.
[19:02.160 --> 19:03.160]  Honestly, no.
[19:03.160 --> 19:08.160]  I have never thought about mapping where the seeds came from on the plant.
[19:08.160 --> 19:15.160]  I've always been so excited just to get all of the seeds out so that I could count them and package them up and then get them out to people.
[19:15.160 --> 19:21.160]  But I've never thought to pay attention to where the actual seed came from on which part of the plant.
[19:21.160 --> 19:27.160]  I think I'm going to set aside a plant and do that myself when I clean the seeds next time.
[19:27.160 --> 19:30.160]  I'm going to cut the top bud off and then I'll cut the bottom buds off.
[19:30.160 --> 19:33.160]  And then I'll go and get the buds that are right next to the stick.
[19:33.160 --> 19:35.160]  I know what you mean when you go up that top bud.
[19:35.160 --> 19:38.160]  A bunch of the seeds are going to be right up the stem.
[19:38.160 --> 19:39.160]  So I'll set those aside.
[19:39.160 --> 19:43.160]  And then I'll set the top buds that have the seeds, I'll set those aside.
[19:43.160 --> 19:45.160]  And then the bottom buds, I'll set those aside.
[19:45.160 --> 19:47.160]  And then I'm going to germinate some of them.
[19:47.160 --> 19:49.160]  And I'll grow them and see if they perform differently.
[19:49.160 --> 19:50.160]  And I'll take notes of it.
[19:50.160 --> 19:53.160]  Because that could be very helpful.
[19:53.160 --> 19:58.160]  That could help the breeder speed up the entire pheno hunt process.
[19:58.160 --> 20:05.160]  If I know which seeds are going to give me the winner plants that are going to be more likely to give me the champions,
[20:05.160 --> 20:10.160]  if I already know which toolbox to reach into to get the appropriate tool, then that'll speed up my breeding.
[20:10.160 --> 20:11.160]  That's going to help me.
[20:11.160 --> 20:12.160]  It'll help everybody.
[20:12.160 --> 20:16.160]  Now I'm sure that there's some hater out there already going,
[20:16.160 --> 20:19.160]  he's just going to keep all those good seeds for himself and send us all the crappy ones.
[20:19.160 --> 20:20.160]  No, don't worry.
[20:20.160 --> 20:25.160]  There are so many seeds that even if I wanted to do that, it would be pointless.
[20:25.160 --> 20:29.160]  I couldn't grow all of those seeds from one plant by myself.
[20:29.160 --> 20:35.160]  And I have already got such a hoard, such a collection, such a catalog, such a backstock of other seeds,
[20:35.160 --> 20:39.160]  that you do not have to worry about me keeping the good ones for myself.
[20:39.160 --> 20:41.160]  I want you guys to have the good ones.
[20:41.160 --> 20:44.160]  I'll get 10 or 20 of them, and I'll be just fine.
[20:44.160 --> 20:45.160]  That's all I need.
[20:45.160 --> 20:46.160]  Then I want the rest to go to you.
[20:46.160 --> 20:51.160]  So don't think I'm going to keep the best ones for myself if I do learn how to identify those seeds.
[20:51.160 --> 20:53.160]  Hey, that's a great idea, Robert Nash.
[20:53.160 --> 20:54.160]  Thanks for the inspiration.
[20:54.160 --> 20:55.160]  Thanks for the motivation.
[20:55.160 --> 20:56.160]  And thanks for a new project.
[20:56.160 --> 20:58.160]  And thanks for more notes to take.
[20:58.160 --> 20:59.160]  I appreciate that.
[20:59.160 --> 21:02.160]  If you guys do something like this, make sure you take lots of notes.
[21:02.160 --> 21:05.160]  We're going to do an episode about journaling here in the future.
[21:05.160 --> 21:09.160]  I strongly encourage keeping a grow journal and taking lots of strong notes.
[21:09.160 --> 21:11.160]  Hey, dude, thanks for the great email.
[21:11.160 --> 21:13.160]  I'm going to move forward.
[21:13.160 --> 21:17.160]  This next email says, Hey, Rasta Jeff, I just started listening two weeks ago,
[21:17.160 --> 21:19.160]  and I've been crushing through since.
[21:19.160 --> 21:20.160]  Keep up the good work.
[21:20.160 --> 21:21.160]  Hey, man, thanks for listening.
[21:21.160 --> 21:25.160]  Keep crushing because there are 300 episodes to catch up on.
[21:25.160 --> 21:29.160]  If you get through all 100 of the episodes on iTunes or Stitcher,
[21:29.160 --> 21:35.160]  you can go to YouTube because episodes 1 through 260 are now available on YouTube,
[21:35.160 --> 21:38.160]  or at least they'll be there until YouTube crushes my channel.
[21:38.160 --> 21:40.160]  We'll talk more about that in a future episode.
[21:40.160 --> 21:43.160]  And dude, thanks for the compliment, and I will keep up the good work.
[21:43.160 --> 21:44.160]  I promise.
[21:44.160 --> 21:47.160]  As long as there is a platform for this podcast to be listened to,
[21:47.160 --> 21:50.160]  if there's a place for this to be heard, I will put it out.
[21:50.160 --> 21:55.160]  So the message goes on, and it says, Today I'm smoking some Golden Goat live resin.
[21:55.160 --> 21:56.160]  It is so tasty.
[21:56.160 --> 21:58.160]  Hey, shout out to the Golden Goat.
[21:58.160 --> 21:59.160]  I've done a lot of work with that.
[21:59.160 --> 22:02.160]  A lot of people think I bred and invented the Golden Goat.
[22:02.160 --> 22:04.160]  I did not create the Golden Goat, you guys.
[22:04.160 --> 22:06.160]  That was done by a guy named Mr. Dank.
[22:06.160 --> 22:08.160]  I got the clone from a friend that I call.
[22:08.160 --> 22:11.160]  I call him Pineapple Express just because he's from Hawaii.
[22:11.160 --> 22:14.160]  I've had a lot of Hawaii references in the past week.
[22:14.160 --> 22:15.160]  That's been awesome.
[22:15.160 --> 22:18.160]  I got the clone from that guy, and I loved it, so I bred with it.
[22:18.160 --> 22:20.160]  But shout out to Golden Goat.
[22:20.160 --> 22:24.160]  He also says, Was curious what your thoughts are on the pathogen death wands
[22:24.160 --> 22:27.160]  I hear so much about from California growers.
[22:27.160 --> 22:34.160]  I'm experimenting with a 1000 watt HPS and an infrared UV LED as a cheaper alternative.
[22:35.160 --> 22:41.160]  The death wand sounds like it's too good to be true and costs $500 to $800 a piece.
[22:41.160 --> 22:47.160]  I can't justify that expense, so I'm making my own from LED strands and different light spectrums.
[22:47.160 --> 22:49.160]  And then he said, Thanks again.
[22:49.160 --> 22:54.160]  And then he signed his name, and I'm not sure if he wants that said, so I'm not going to share that out of respect.
[22:54.160 --> 22:56.160]  Hey, dude, thanks for the great email.
[22:56.160 --> 22:59.160]  You guys, if you'd like to send me an email, it's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[22:59.160 --> 23:00.160]  I'd love to hear from you.
[23:00.160 --> 23:02.160]  I would love to answer your questions.
[23:02.160 --> 23:05.160]  Let's talk about pathogen death wands.
[23:05.160 --> 23:07.160]  What he's talking about, you guys.
[23:07.160 --> 23:09.160]  It kind of looks like a lightsaber.
[23:09.160 --> 23:11.160]  There are different versions of them available.
[23:11.160 --> 23:17.160]  It looks like a lightsaber with the shield over one end of it so that that way the light doesn't shine into your face from that direction.
[23:17.160 --> 23:22.160]  It kind of looks like one of those, like a bug light, sort of.
[23:22.160 --> 23:23.160]  It's got a handle.
[23:23.160 --> 23:26.160]  There are different versions, but the one I'm familiar with plugs into the wall.
[23:26.160 --> 23:31.160]  It's got a handle on it that you would kind of hold sort of like the weed eater.
[23:31.160 --> 23:34.160]  Like if you're going to do the weed eater, it holds the handle is kind of shaped like that.
[23:34.160 --> 23:40.160]  And then it's got basically a small light reflector on it with a light bulb inside of it.
[23:40.160 --> 23:42.160]  And that is a UV light inside of there.
[23:42.160 --> 23:46.160]  And what that light does is it destroys powdery mildew.
[23:46.160 --> 23:50.160]  That UV light breaks down powdery mildew almost instantly.
[23:50.160 --> 23:55.160]  And so what growers will do is they will plug in this light and you've got to wear protective eyewear.
[23:55.160 --> 23:57.160]  They sell you certain glasses with this light.
[23:57.160 --> 24:04.160]  You have to wear those glasses and do not by any means ever look into your death wand.
[24:04.160 --> 24:06.160]  It is called a fucking death wand.
[24:06.160 --> 24:08.160]  If you look into it, your eyes are toast.
[24:08.160 --> 24:11.160]  Okay, you will go blind.
[24:11.160 --> 24:13.160]  This thing is not a joke.
[24:13.160 --> 24:15.160]  So be really serious about this.
[24:15.160 --> 24:17.160]  There are a lot of things we play with in the grow that can hurt us.
[24:17.160 --> 24:20.160]  This one, you will instantly feel the effects.
[24:20.160 --> 24:22.160]  You will be fucking blind.
[24:22.160 --> 24:23.160]  No more Fortnite.
[24:23.160 --> 24:24.160]  All right.
[24:24.160 --> 24:25.160]  Think about that.
[24:25.160 --> 24:28.160]  I don't play video games, but everyone is stuck on Fortnite right now.
[24:28.160 --> 24:32.160]  If you fuck up with the pathogen death wand and look into it, you don't get to play Fortnite anymore.
[24:32.160 --> 24:33.160]  All right.
[24:33.160 --> 24:34.160]  Think about that.
[24:34.160 --> 24:36.160]  So the pathogen death wand.
[24:36.160 --> 24:38.160]  They are making them with a UV light.
[24:38.160 --> 24:40.160]  They are putting different types of lights in them.
[24:40.160 --> 24:41.160]  You hold it.
[24:41.160 --> 24:43.160]  It has this handle like I explained.
[24:43.160 --> 24:45.160]  It has the reflector coming off of it.
[24:45.160 --> 24:47.160]  And then it has a light that shines down.
[24:47.160 --> 24:54.160]  And you just simply walk down the rows of plants and just shine this light over the canopy and try to get the light on each leaf surface.
[24:54.160 --> 24:55.160]  You don't touch it.
[24:55.160 --> 24:56.160]  You shine it over it.
[24:56.160 --> 24:58.160]  You go about 10 to 14 inches away.
[24:58.160 --> 25:01.160]  And you just hover that light above every single leaf.
[25:01.160 --> 25:04.160]  And you try to get it over each leaf for about 1 to 2 seconds.
[25:04.160 --> 25:09.160]  If you go too long, it will kind of wrinkle and burn the leaves if you stay there too long.
[25:09.160 --> 25:13.160]  So I would pick a spot that you can get to and just shine the light over there.
[25:13.160 --> 25:15.160]  And then just start walking down that row.
[25:15.160 --> 25:16.160]  And then finish that row.
[25:16.160 --> 25:19.160]  And then go to the other side of the table and walk up that row.
[25:19.160 --> 25:22.160]  And then if you can't get to the middle, maybe reach your arm out real far.
[25:22.160 --> 25:24.160]  Maybe hang it on a pole or something.
[25:24.160 --> 25:27.160]  Put it on a PVC pipe or a 2x4 and just get it a little extension.
[25:27.160 --> 25:30.160]  Just do your best to get over the entire canopy.
[25:30.160 --> 25:34.160]  You want to get that light over each and every leaf of that whole canopy.
[25:34.160 --> 25:37.160]  Don't ever do it while the plants are wet, you guys.
[25:37.160 --> 25:44.160]  If you've got morning dew or if you've applied not the strain morning dew, actual morning dew, like some dew in the morning, some moisture.
[25:44.160 --> 25:51.160]  Or if you've sprayed the plants or if it's rained or something like that, don't shine this UV light over any moisture bubbles because that's going to give you problems.
[25:51.160 --> 25:55.160]  But just simply walk the rows and shine the light over every single plant.
[25:55.160 --> 25:58.160]  And that's going to help you get rid of your powdery mildew.
[25:58.160 --> 26:01.160]  It's going to help you get rid of other spores and pathogens.
[26:01.160 --> 26:10.160]  The problem is, the one that you are making, I'm not sure it is going to be the correct spectrum and the correct lighting.
[26:10.160 --> 26:17.160]  The reason they're so expensive is because they're using the UV light and the infrared lighting and those are expensive.
[26:17.160 --> 26:23.160]  I understand you're trying to save a few bucks, but I'm not sure if you're using the right spectrums.
[26:23.160 --> 26:25.160]  I hope it works. Let me know how it works for you.
[26:25.160 --> 26:38.160]  If you're already battling PM and you run your 1000 watt HPS and your infrared and UV and LEDs, if you run that over there and it destroys your powdery mildew, let me know how that works.
[26:38.160 --> 26:40.160]  Because you're right, those death ones are somewhere.
[26:40.160 --> 26:44.160]  I've seen them for as low as $400 for a very entry level one.
[26:44.160 --> 26:48.160]  It would probably take you two weeks to run that little light over your entire garden.
[26:48.160 --> 26:51.160]  And it's not super intense. You'd have to be at it every day.
[26:51.160 --> 26:53.160]  But yes, they are super expensive.
[26:53.160 --> 26:56.160]  I hope your homemade MacGyver device works for you.
[26:56.160 --> 26:58.160]  I wish you the best of luck.
[26:58.160 --> 27:01.160]  I understand not being able to justify the expense at the time.
[27:02.160 --> 27:08.160]  But what you're going to really have to do is you're going to have to figure out what is causing the powdery mildew in your grow.
[27:08.160 --> 27:13.160]  Just simply treating it with the death wand all the time is not going to be effective.
[27:13.160 --> 27:18.160]  You're going to find yourself in there way too frequently spending way too many man hours trying to fight this.
[27:18.160 --> 27:25.160]  It's going to be more cost effective to eliminate the problem, find the cause and correct that.
[27:25.160 --> 27:27.160]  Maybe you need more HVAC.
[27:27.160 --> 27:29.160]  Maybe you need more dehumidification.
[27:29.160 --> 27:31.160]  Maybe your vapor pressure deficit is off.
[27:31.160 --> 27:34.160]  Maybe it's too hot. Maybe it's too cold.
[27:34.160 --> 27:36.160]  Maybe you have too far of a swing in there.
[27:36.160 --> 27:41.160]  Do you have something in that room that is letting you know what your temperatures are constantly?
[27:41.160 --> 27:48.160]  I know we've all got the hygrometer that hangs in the room, the hygrometer thermometer combo that lets you know how hot it got and how cool it got.
[27:48.160 --> 27:51.160]  But does it tell you for how long and when it happened?
[27:51.160 --> 27:54.160]  We need something that lets us know what's going on in the grow.
[27:54.160 --> 27:56.160]  So find out what's happening in there.
[27:56.160 --> 27:59.160]  I bet your problem is happening right when the lights go off.
[27:59.160 --> 28:02.160]  That's usually the temperatures drop.
[28:02.160 --> 28:05.160]  The humidity goes real high because all that moisture is in the air.
[28:05.160 --> 28:07.160]  You've got all that dew in the air.
[28:07.160 --> 28:08.160]  It's dark.
[28:08.160 --> 28:10.160]  You're just welcoming powdery mildew right then.
[28:10.160 --> 28:12.160]  So find out what's happening in your grow.
[28:12.160 --> 28:14.160]  Correct the issue.
[28:14.160 --> 28:17.160]  Then you will not have to spend money on a death wand.
[28:17.160 --> 28:23.160]  You won't have to spend hours on time walking around shining a light over plants.
[28:23.160 --> 28:25.160]  It doesn't feel like you're doing anything when you do it.
[28:25.160 --> 28:27.160]  I've used one of these things before in another grow.
[28:27.160 --> 28:30.160]  It did not feel like anything was happening.
[28:30.160 --> 28:33.160]  I could see that the powdery mildew would disappear, but you're just walking around shining a light.
[28:33.160 --> 28:39.160]  It feels like such a waste of time when there are such other important things to be done in a commercial grow.
[28:39.160 --> 28:42.160]  So I hope this does work for you.
[28:42.160 --> 28:43.160]  You asked about my thoughts.
[28:43.160 --> 28:44.160]  They do work.
[28:44.160 --> 28:48.160]  If you buy the appropriate death wand, it will work for you.
[28:48.160 --> 28:54.160]  They actually make lights out of the same UV and infrared that go inside of your HVAC equipment.
[28:54.160 --> 28:57.160]  They will work to kill the spores in the HVAC as well.
[28:57.160 --> 29:00.160]  They're quite expensive to install, but they're constantly running.
[29:00.160 --> 29:03.160]  Anything that passes through your HVAC system will then be killed.
[29:03.160 --> 29:05.160]  It will not even make it to your grow room.
[29:05.160 --> 29:13.160]  There are other alternatives that aren't as expensive, but the first thing you need to do is correct the issue in the grow room.
[29:13.160 --> 29:16.160]  So figure out what's causing the problem.
[29:16.160 --> 29:19.160]  Find a solution and then implement that solution.
[29:19.160 --> 29:22.160]  Hopefully, you can stop having powdery mildew.
[29:22.160 --> 29:28.160]  The pathogen death wand is sort of like taking cough medicine.
[29:28.160 --> 29:32.160]  What we need to do is take better care of ourselves so that we don't get a cough.
[29:32.160 --> 29:34.160]  You're out there with a cold.
[29:34.160 --> 29:37.160]  We've got to make sure that we don't get a cold again.
[29:37.160 --> 29:38.160]  So let's figure out what caused the problem.
[29:38.160 --> 29:40.160]  Let's implement a solution.
[29:40.160 --> 29:45.160]  In the meantime, I hope your makeshift death wand works out for you.
[29:45.160 --> 29:54.160]  I am curious how it works because we could save a lot of people a lot of money if they don't have to spend the $500-$800 on the horticultural death wand.
[29:54.160 --> 29:56.160]  Hey dude, I really do appreciate this email.
[29:56.160 --> 29:58.160]  I look forward to your response.
[29:58.160 --> 30:00.160]  I look forward to following up with you.
[30:00.160 --> 30:08.160]  Like I said earlier, if anybody out there has a question about cannabis, about cannabis growing, about cannabis consumption, about cannabis politics,
[30:08.160 --> 30:14.160]  if there are any myths or rumors or anything you'd like cleared up about cannabis, I would be happy to answer your questions.
[30:14.160 --> 30:16.160]  All you've got to do is send me an email.
[30:16.160 --> 30:18.160]  It's growfromyourheart.com.
[30:18.160 --> 30:23.160]  Maybe you will hear your question answered on a future episode.
[30:23.160 --> 30:29.160]  Alright, Podcast World, I've got one more quick email I want to read, but before I do that, I want to give a couple of quick shoutouts.
[30:29.160 --> 30:31.160]  I owe a huge shoutout to my buddy Dank Sinatra.
[30:31.160 --> 30:32.160]  What's up, buddy?
[30:32.160 --> 30:35.160]  Also, a hug and a shoutout to Cannabliss.
[30:35.160 --> 30:39.160]  A big old fist bump and a high five to Warpath Glass.
[30:39.160 --> 30:42.160]  And a big old Viking handshake to my buddy Grimbold the Druid.
[30:42.160 --> 30:43.160]  Thanks for the love and support, you guys.
[30:43.160 --> 30:47.160]  Alright, I've got one more email, and it goes like this.
[30:47.160 --> 30:50.160]  It says, hey, Rasta Jeff, stay iry and stay elevated.
[30:50.160 --> 30:51.160]  I love your show.
[30:51.160 --> 30:54.160]  I'm a new grower and a new podcast host.
[30:54.160 --> 30:58.160]  I heard you say that YouTube will not accept your music, and I've been having the same issue.
[30:58.160 --> 31:00.160]  This is a big problem.
[31:00.160 --> 31:02.160]  I would love to hear how you resolve this.
[31:02.160 --> 31:03.160]  Thanks for sharing.
[31:03.160 --> 31:09.160]  You and the DGC, which is the Dude Grows crew, inspired me and my buddy, Soup, to start up a podcast.
[31:09.160 --> 31:12.160]  Hey, I think I met Soup at the Dude Grows Cup.
[31:12.160 --> 31:13.160]  Shoutout to Soup.
[31:13.160 --> 31:15.160]  He said, we shot you out on episode two.
[31:15.160 --> 31:19.160]  Our podcast is called Let's Smoke Cannabis.
[31:19.160 --> 31:21.160]  So check it out at letsmokecannabis.com, you guys.
[31:21.160 --> 31:22.160]  He sent me a link here.
[31:22.160 --> 31:23.160]  Click on the link, alright?
[31:23.160 --> 31:25.160]  Go check it out, letsmokecannabis.com.
[31:25.160 --> 31:27.160]  He said, you're great for the community.
[31:27.160 --> 31:29.160]  Thanks for everything, Rasta Jeff.
[31:29.160 --> 31:32.160]  What's the best way to promote your podcast?
[31:32.160 --> 31:35.160]  Positive vibes and cheers from bong.cali.
[31:35.160 --> 31:37.160]  P.S. we hit up your Patreon.
[31:37.160 --> 31:39.160]  Hey, thank you for the Patreon contribution.
[31:39.160 --> 31:40.160]  I appreciate that.
[31:40.160 --> 31:42.160]  What's the best way to promote?
[31:42.160 --> 31:48.160]  Are you asking the best way for you to promote my show, or the best way to promote a podcast in general?
[31:48.160 --> 31:51.160]  My answer is going to kind of be the same.
[31:51.160 --> 31:56.160]  The best way to promote your podcast is just to focus on putting out quality content.
[31:56.160 --> 31:58.160]  People hear podcasts, and when they hear it...
[31:58.160 --> 32:00.160]  Excuse the throat clearing, you guys.
[32:00.160 --> 32:02.160]  Hold on for just one quick second.
[32:04.160 --> 32:06.160]  Alright, so people hear quality content.
[32:06.160 --> 32:09.160]  So when they hear it, they like it, and they talk about it, and they tell their friends.
[32:09.160 --> 32:12.160]  And then their friends listen to it, and their friends do the same thing.
[32:12.160 --> 32:18.160]  The best way that I have found to advertise and promote a podcast is just to focus on doing a quality show,
[32:18.160 --> 32:20.160]  and the show will promote itself.
[32:20.160 --> 32:24.160]  The more people listen, the more you get moved up in iTunes, the more you get moved up in Stitcher,
[32:24.160 --> 32:26.160]  and then more people listen.
[32:26.160 --> 32:28.160]  Don't worry about promoting, don't worry about advertising.
[32:28.160 --> 32:34.160]  Focus on your job, which is doing a quality show, and a quality product will sell itself.
[32:34.160 --> 32:35.160]  That's what I think.
[32:35.160 --> 32:40.160]  I think a little bit of Instagram, a little bit of social media is good for you, but don't overdo it.
[32:40.160 --> 32:45.160]  Don't get too caught up trying to be relevant to where you push yourself out of being relevant.
[32:45.160 --> 32:49.160]  Do your job, and things will come the way that they're supposed to.
[32:49.160 --> 32:50.160]  So that's what I say.
[32:50.160 --> 32:56.160]  The best way, if you want to promote your podcast, light social media, maybe just word of mouth, and do a great show.
[32:56.160 --> 32:58.160]  The best way to promote my podcast, just say,
[32:58.160 --> 33:02.160]  Just say, hey, listen to the Grow From Your Heart podcast on your show, just like I'm going to say,
[33:02.160 --> 33:08.160]  listen to Let's Smoke Cannabis, the new cannabis podcast, with my friends Soup and Bong.
[33:08.160 --> 33:10.160]  There's another dude, what's his name?
[33:10.160 --> 33:14.160]  Fuck, Stew, Beef Stew, Roast, Pot Roast, that's his name.
[33:14.160 --> 33:15.160]  It took me a fucking minute to remember his name.
[33:15.160 --> 33:17.160]  Sorry I called you Stew, bro.
[33:17.160 --> 33:18.160]  That's fucked up.
[33:18.160 --> 33:20.160]  Pot Roast, they call him Roast now.
[33:20.160 --> 33:24.160]  So yeah, check out that show, letsmokecannabis.com.
[33:24.160 --> 33:26.160]  Let's move up and see the rest of the questions.
[33:26.160 --> 33:28.160]  He said he's a new grower and a new podcast host.
[33:28.160 --> 33:29.160]  Hey, keep it up, man.
[33:29.160 --> 33:31.160]  It sounds like you're off to a good start on the podcast.
[33:31.160 --> 33:32.160]  I actually have listened.
[33:32.160 --> 33:33.160]  YouTube.
[33:33.160 --> 33:40.160]  YouTube is not, they will accept my submissions with other people's music, but I cannot monetize it,
[33:40.160 --> 33:43.160]  and they give me little strikes against my account for copyright violations.
[33:43.160 --> 33:51.160]  My resolution has been to create my own opening and closing music and not play other people's music on the show.
[33:51.160 --> 33:54.160]  Of course, I fucked that all up on this episode because I couldn't resist,
[33:54.160 --> 33:59.160]  and I had to play some Morgan Heritage for you, but this episode simply won't be monetized.
[33:59.160 --> 34:03.160]  Honestly, I don't make a penny off of my YouTube channel because I don't get enough views for that,
[34:03.160 --> 34:05.160]  so it doesn't even matter.
[34:05.160 --> 34:09.160]  If I were Joe Rogan or something, that would make a huge difference to me.
[34:09.160 --> 34:14.160]  I'm sure Rogan makes thousands of dollars per YouTube episode, and I don't make pennies,
[34:14.160 --> 34:19.160]  so I don't mind losing the monetization of one show that wouldn't have gotten paid anything anyway.
[34:19.160 --> 34:20.160]  So that's alright.
[34:20.160 --> 34:21.160]  That's just my way around it.
[34:21.160 --> 34:22.160]  They'll let the episodes go up.
[34:22.160 --> 34:25.160]  I just can't monetize it, and they give me little copyright strikes,
[34:25.160 --> 34:27.160]  and they let me know that they're looking.
[34:27.160 --> 34:33.160]  We have to be careful as a cannabis community because right now YouTube is taking down all of the cannabis channels,
[34:33.160 --> 34:35.160]  so hopefully I survive.
[34:35.160 --> 34:38.160]  Hopefully Let's Smoke Cannabis survives.
[34:38.160 --> 34:42.160]  But anyway, that was my resolution, is I just made my own music,
[34:42.160 --> 34:47.160]  and I try to refrain from using copywritten music that is not owned by myself.
[34:47.160 --> 34:50.160]  Another thing that you could do is you could record your episode,
[34:51.160 --> 34:55.160]  and then you can add the music and post it to iTunes, and then you could go,
[34:55.160 --> 34:56.160]  however you're recording.
[34:56.160 --> 34:57.160]  I use GarageBand.
[34:57.160 --> 35:04.160]  I would go into GarageBand and just delete the music track and then post that file to YouTube instead of using the music part.
[35:04.160 --> 35:07.160]  So it's a little bit different experience for the different listeners, but that's alright,
[35:07.160 --> 35:12.160]  because nobody will know unless they listen on two different platforms, and they'll just be missing music.
[35:12.160 --> 35:18.160]  But my recommendation would just be to either make your own song or recruit somebody with the proper software
[35:18.160 --> 35:20.160]  and the time and skills to make a song for you.
[35:20.160 --> 35:22.160]  You can pay people to do it.
[35:22.160 --> 35:26.160]  There are services where you can go and have them create a custom jingle for you.
[35:26.160 --> 35:27.160]  I'm not sure if that's in your budget.
[35:27.160 --> 35:29.160]  I haven't considered doing that yet.
[35:29.160 --> 35:33.160]  I would like to get one of my favorite reggae artists to do a dub plate for me.
[35:33.160 --> 35:35.160]  But that's what I would recommend.
[35:35.160 --> 35:36.160]  Get some custom music made.
[35:36.160 --> 35:39.160]  He said, you're great for the community, and thanks for everything.
[35:39.160 --> 35:40.160]  Hey, dude, thanks for the huge compliments.
[35:40.160 --> 35:41.160]  I appreciate that.
[35:41.160 --> 35:43.160]  And you're very welcome.
[35:43.160 --> 35:44.160]  Thanks for the love.
[35:44.160 --> 35:45.160]  Thanks for the support.
[35:45.160 --> 35:46.160]  Thanks for your podcast.
[35:46.160 --> 35:50.160]  Thanks for what you're doing for me for the community and extra thanks for the Patreon.
[35:50.160 --> 35:54.160]  Every month, the Patreon gets bigger and bigger, and I appreciate that.
[35:54.160 --> 35:58.160]  I'm moving toward a goal, and I can't wait to reach that goal.
[35:58.160 --> 36:03.160]  You guys check out patreon.com slash go from your heart for all of that information.
[36:03.160 --> 36:06.160]  My friend Bong, thanks again for the great email, dude.
[36:06.160 --> 36:12.160]  Once again, you guys, if you'd like to send me an email, the email address is grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[36:12.160 --> 36:13.160]  I would love to hear from you.
[36:13.160 --> 36:16.160]  I may answer your question on a future episode.
[36:16.160 --> 36:19.160]  And you guys, if I don't respond to your email, don't take it personally.
[36:19.160 --> 36:20.160]  I get a lot of emails.
[36:20.160 --> 36:23.160]  I've got over 100 unread emails in my inbox right now.
[36:23.160 --> 36:25.160]  I will get to the emails.
[36:25.160 --> 36:27.160]  I slowly work my way through.
[36:27.160 --> 36:34.160]  In fact, some of the emails that I've gotten this pile of pernick emails are from about a year ago, but I'm still going to read them because they're still relevant questions.
[36:34.160 --> 36:38.160]  I'm kind of behind on the person that needed help, but hopefully I can help somebody else.
[36:38.160 --> 36:41.160]  All right, you guys keep the emails coming.
[36:41.160 --> 36:42.160]  Keep supporting the show.
[36:42.160 --> 36:45.160]  I completely appreciate all of the interaction with everybody.
[36:45.160 --> 36:47.160]  I would love it if you support me on social media.
[36:47.160 --> 36:49.160]  You can find me on Facebook.
[36:49.160 --> 36:52.160]  Simply search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast on Instagram.
[36:52.160 --> 36:54.160]  I'm irie underscore genetics.
[36:54.160 --> 36:58.160]  I like to do Instagram live videos where I go and hang out and smoke dabs and talk about growing cannabis.
[36:58.160 --> 37:01.160]  I let people ask me cannabis questions and I answer on the fly.
[37:01.160 --> 37:02.160]  I don't have any notes.
[37:02.160 --> 37:03.160]  I don't have any preparation.
[37:03.160 --> 37:05.160]  So it's kind of fun for me.
[37:05.160 --> 37:06.160]  It's fun for the viewers.
[37:06.160 --> 37:08.160]  It's fun to just hang out and smoke with me.
[37:08.160 --> 37:10.160]  Sometimes it's not as put together as the podcast.
[37:10.160 --> 37:12.160]  So I kind of chill out a little bit and have a little more fun.
[37:12.160 --> 37:14.160]  So check me out on Instagram.
[37:14.160 --> 37:16.160]  It's irie underscore genetics.

[37:20.160 --> 37:22.160]  I'm rostagef420.
[37:22.160 --> 37:23.160]  Really easy to find.
[37:23.160 --> 37:26.160]  I'm sure I've mentioned it at least once or twice in this episode.
[37:26.160 --> 37:27.160]  Don't forget about my email.

[37:37.160 --> 37:38.160]  I would love to hear from you.
[37:38.160 --> 37:40.160]  Also, like I've mentioned before, YouTube.
[37:40.160 --> 37:44.160]  There are currently 260 videos available on YouTube.
[37:44.160 --> 37:47.160]  I'm not sure how long the YouTube channel is going to last.
[37:47.160 --> 37:51.160]  YouTube is on a crackdown, taking all the cannabis channels and cannabis material down.
[37:51.160 --> 37:53.160]  So catch them while you can.
[37:53.160 --> 37:56.160]  I'll keep posting videos until they shut me down, you guys.
[37:56.160 --> 37:59.160]  I will get caught up to episode, this is 312.
[37:59.160 --> 38:05.160]  I plan to have all, excuse me, I plan to have all 312 episodes up there unless they shut me down.
[38:06.160 --> 38:08.160]  And then if they shut me down, I'll join a new service.
[38:08.160 --> 38:12.160]  I'm going to talk about some stuff on a future episode, some more options.
[38:12.160 --> 38:13.160]  So stay tuned for that.
[38:13.160 --> 38:17.160]  Also, I've mentioned it already, but don't forget patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.

[38:26.160 --> 38:28.160]  I'm not trying to get rich off of podcasting.
[38:28.160 --> 38:32.160]  I would just like some help covering the price of the new computer I bought for the show.
[38:32.160 --> 38:34.160]  Also covering the website for the year.
[38:34.160 --> 38:37.160]  Also these little microphone covers and my internet connection.
[38:37.160 --> 38:39.160]  Just asking for a little help, not trying to beg.
[38:39.160 --> 38:43.160]  There are a few people out there who have offered to contribute, who have wanted to help.
[38:43.160 --> 38:47.160]  Obviously there are several people who do enjoy supporting the show, so thank you to all of them.

[38:55.160 --> 38:57.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, I feel like I'm talking super fast.
[38:57.160 --> 38:59.160]  I feel like I got super rambly at the end of the show.
[38:59.160 --> 39:02.160]  I'm going to wrap it up so that it's a good show before I get off topic here.
[39:02.160 --> 39:06.160]  I want to give a huge shout out to everybody out there on the big island.
[39:06.160 --> 39:08.160]  Take care of yourselves. Take care of one another.
[39:08.160 --> 39:10.160]  I love each and every one of you.
[39:10.160 --> 39:12.160]  Also, huge shout out to my friend, Kelvin Medina.
[39:12.160 --> 39:16.160]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[40:01.700 --> 40:05.700]  And find the truth for myself.
[40:07.700 --> 40:10.700]  The world is more beautiful than you know.
[40:10.700 --> 40:15.420]  So much beauty.
[40:17.420 --> 40:19.420]  So much is.
[40:21.420 --> 40:23.420]  Like I'm going to send a gun.
[40:24.420 --> 40:26.420]  Never reach Carribean Islands.
[40:27.420 --> 40:29.420]  The slave trade was wicked.
[40:29.420 --> 40:35.890]  You know, I know.
[40:36.890 --> 40:56.740]  It's just.
[41:15.750 --> 41:18.750]  I realize music is the savior.
[41:19.750 --> 41:22.750]  Preserving the knowledge of our former selves.
[41:23.750 --> 41:26.750]  You know, if you never knew.
[41:27.750 --> 41:30.750]  You know, the culture.
[41:31.750 --> 41:33.750]  Culture.
