[00:17.920 --> 00:25.890]  All right, here we go.
[00:25.890 --> 00:27.450]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:27.450 --> 00:28.450]  I'm your host.
[00:28.450 --> 00:30.010]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.

[01:21.130 --> 01:21.530]  Thank you.
[01:21.530 --> 01:23.830]  Shout out to growing Tennessee.

[01:45.130 --> 01:49.430]  description to make it nice and easy for everyone to support the show.
[01:50.130 --> 01:54.130]  I want to start off by sending a big shout out to my friend who allegedly
[01:54.130 --> 01:59.230]  possibly sent me or made some lemon Jeffrey concentrates that has got me.
[01:59.330 --> 02:01.130]  Um, I don't even know the word.
[02:01.130 --> 02:02.130]  I'm a little bit goofy.
[02:02.130 --> 02:03.130]  I'm like dodging shit.
[02:03.130 --> 02:04.730]  That's not coming at me over here.
[02:04.930 --> 02:07.330]  Uh, I'm high as shit from that lemon Jeffrey, bro.
[02:07.330 --> 02:10.830]  If you made the lemon Jeffrey concentrates that somehow landed in my rig a few
[02:10.830 --> 02:13.530]  minutes ago, that shit is effective, bro.
[02:13.530 --> 02:15.430]  Good, good job.
[02:15.430 --> 02:16.530]  Where do we go from there?
[02:16.530 --> 02:17.530]  The greenhouse.
[02:17.730 --> 02:20.830]  If you've been following along, you know that I'm doing a breeding project
[02:20.830 --> 02:21.830]  in a greenhouse.
[02:21.830 --> 02:23.930]  I was at the greenhouse today and guess what?
[02:24.330 --> 02:25.230]  Everything looks good.
[02:25.230 --> 02:26.130]  Not a lot to report.
[02:26.130 --> 02:26.830]  Things are growing.
[02:26.830 --> 02:27.630]  Things are in veg.
[02:27.630 --> 02:28.330]  They're getting big.
[02:28.330 --> 02:29.330]  They're growing quickly.
[02:29.630 --> 02:32.030]  Uh, I'm always amazed at the outdoor growth.
[02:32.030 --> 02:33.630]  I'm not there every single day.
[02:33.830 --> 02:37.230]  So when I do go there, it looks like they've grown, uh, astronomically since
[02:37.230 --> 02:40.630]  the last time I was there, they grow so fast outdoors compared to the indoors,
[02:40.830 --> 02:43.330]  uh, double or triple as fast outdoors is what I think.
[02:43.630 --> 02:44.630]  Uh, but they're looking good.
[02:44.630 --> 02:49.030]  They're going strong, not a lot to report, but everything looks good in the
[02:49.030 --> 02:51.130]  greenhouse breeding project.
[02:51.130 --> 02:52.530]  Stay tuned in future episodes.
[02:52.530 --> 02:55.230]  I will talk more about what plants I've got going on out there.
[02:55.530 --> 02:59.030]  Of course, we did put the Jack the Ripper male outside.
[02:59.030 --> 03:01.830]  So that's what we'll be dumping pollen this year.
[03:01.930 --> 03:04.830]  I love doing the teases about the greenhouse and keeping you updated.
[03:04.830 --> 03:05.830]  Not a lot to report.
[03:05.930 --> 03:06.530]  Stay tuned.
[03:06.530 --> 03:07.830]  There will be more in the future.
[03:08.330 --> 03:09.830]  All right, the next order of business.
[03:09.830 --> 03:13.730]  I look forward to seeing you at the DGC growers cup.
[03:13.830 --> 03:14.330]  That's right.
[03:14.330 --> 03:19.030]  Saturday, July 30th at a location just outside of Colorado Springs team.
[03:19.030 --> 03:22.530]  I read genetics will be at the DGC growers cup.
[03:22.730 --> 03:24.030]  I hope to see you there.
[03:24.130 --> 03:26.330]  The cup is going to be a great event.
[03:26.330 --> 03:28.230]  It is a consumption friendly event.
[03:28.230 --> 03:32.730]  We will be there consuming cannabis, making friends, shaking hands, having a
[03:32.730 --> 03:33.530]  good time.
[03:33.630 --> 03:35.530]  There is a small competition happening.
[03:35.530 --> 03:38.930]  A bunch of people have entered some flowers into a competition.
[03:39.130 --> 03:41.530]  Everybody who attends is a judge.
[03:41.530 --> 03:45.830]  If you attend the dude grows cup, the DGC growers cup, you get to be a judge
[03:45.830 --> 03:47.730]  in the flower competition.
[03:47.730 --> 03:50.930]  You get a one, you get a lighter, you get to taste all the entries and you
[03:50.930 --> 03:54.130]  get to vote on what the best flower at the event is.
[03:54.230 --> 03:56.730]  So show up, come taste some good herb, come hang out.
[03:56.730 --> 04:02.330]  There will also be a plethora of great seed breeders vending their seeds at
[04:02.330 --> 04:02.830]  the event.
[04:02.830 --> 04:06.630]  So we do look forward to seeing you at the dude grows cup.
[04:06.630 --> 04:07.930]  For tickets, deets and links.
[04:07.930 --> 04:11.630]  Make sure you do check out dude grows.com for all of the information on
[04:11.630 --> 04:13.630]  the DGC growers cup.
[04:13.630 --> 04:15.930]  There's a big tab right on the front page.
[04:16.030 --> 04:17.130]  You cannot miss it.
[04:17.130 --> 04:17.930]  Come join us.
[04:17.930 --> 04:20.130]  It is going to be a great time.
[04:20.530 --> 04:22.030]  All right, I've been rambling long enough.
[04:22.030 --> 04:25.030]  Let's jump into the email portion of this podcast.
[04:25.130 --> 04:27.430]  I've got a bunch of emails stacked up here on the table.
[04:27.530 --> 04:29.130]  This one comes from our friend Mark.
[04:29.130 --> 04:31.430]  This question is a recap.
[04:31.730 --> 04:36.030]  In a previous episode, somebody did ask me if I think that the male plants or
[04:36.030 --> 04:39.130]  the female plants know about each other in the other rooms.
[04:39.130 --> 04:42.230]  They asked if I notice a difference in the female plants, if I have a male in
[04:42.230 --> 04:45.230]  the other room, or if I notice a difference in the male plants, if I have
[04:45.230 --> 04:46.530]  a female in the other room.
[04:46.730 --> 04:50.730]  I said I've noticed visible differences, but I didn't have any real scientific
[04:50.730 --> 04:51.430]  background.
[04:51.630 --> 04:53.030]  Our friend Mark updated me.
[04:53.030 --> 04:54.730]  He said, I have an update.
[04:54.730 --> 04:55.830]  Thank you for the update, bro.
[04:56.030 --> 05:01.030]  It says I watched a documentary called The Magic Plant and it said the terpenes
[05:01.030 --> 05:04.730]  come from the sun and they are the sex hormones for the plant.
[05:04.730 --> 05:05.830]  So it sounds plausible.
[05:05.830 --> 05:06.430]  I guess.
[05:06.630 --> 05:10.530]  Anyway, take care and thank you for everything you do.
[05:10.930 --> 05:12.830]  Those terpenes do have a lot of purposes.
[05:12.830 --> 05:14.630]  The terps put off a lot of aromas.
[05:14.830 --> 05:19.330]  Think about when you smell food or when you smell candy or when you smell
[05:19.330 --> 05:23.430]  flowers or when you smell a pretty lady or maybe you smell a pretty dude.
[05:23.530 --> 05:25.030]  You go, that smells nice.
[05:25.030 --> 05:26.030]  I want some of that.
[05:26.130 --> 05:28.630]  Maybe the cannabis plants are doing the same thing to each other.
[05:28.630 --> 05:32.830]  Maybe that lady plant is over there going limonene, limonene, and that male
[05:32.830 --> 05:34.630]  plant's going, I need some limonene.
[05:35.230 --> 05:37.630]  We don't know exactly what they're saying because we can't speak their
[05:37.630 --> 05:40.330]  plant language, but it sounds like you're onto something.
[05:40.630 --> 05:42.430]  Maybe those terps act like pheromones.
[05:42.430 --> 05:45.430]  Maybe the plants have pheromones that we haven't, that I haven't learned
[05:45.430 --> 05:48.630]  about yet, but it does make good sense to me.
[05:48.630 --> 05:49.930]  Those terps are doing a lot to me.
[05:49.930 --> 05:51.330]  They make me want to smoke it.
[05:51.330 --> 05:55.130]  So maybe they're making the plants want to mate with each other and I can
[05:55.130 --> 05:56.330]  smell the terps in the other room.
[05:56.330 --> 05:57.230]  That is for sure.
[05:57.330 --> 05:58.930]  So it does make good sense.
[05:59.030 --> 06:00.930]  My dude, Mark, thank you for the great update.
[06:00.930 --> 06:02.130]  I do appreciate it.
[06:02.130 --> 06:04.430]  If anybody else out there has any updates, of course, the
[06:04.430 --> 06:07.930]  email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[06:08.330 --> 06:09.030]  Don't be shy.
[06:09.030 --> 06:09.530]  Reach out.
[06:09.530 --> 06:10.930]  I love generating.
[06:10.930 --> 06:13.230]  I love creating listener generated content.
[06:13.230 --> 06:14.330]  That's what I'm trying to say.
[06:14.530 --> 06:17.030]  I am pre-reading this next message while I'm talking.
[06:17.630 --> 06:21.330]  All right, this next message comes from a good friend and a Patreon supporter.
[06:21.630 --> 06:23.930]  Big shout out to my friend, Girls Grow Too.
[06:24.130 --> 06:26.430]  This message goes a little bit like this.
[06:26.430 --> 06:29.930]  It says, when is it too late to save a plant?
[06:29.930 --> 06:32.030]  That is a very, very good question.
[06:32.030 --> 06:33.630]  When is it too late to save a plant?
[06:33.630 --> 06:34.430]  When do you give up?
[06:34.430 --> 06:35.730]  When do you try to fix it?
[06:35.930 --> 06:36.930]  What is that boundary?
[06:36.930 --> 06:39.930]  Where is that borderline where you say, fuck it and throw in the towel?
[06:40.030 --> 06:42.430]  How hard do you actually try on a plant?
[06:42.530 --> 06:43.730]  And also, is it one plant?
[06:43.730 --> 06:44.730]  Is it several plants?
[06:44.730 --> 06:47.630]  That kind of makes a big difference here, but there's more to the message.
[06:47.630 --> 06:51.830]  It says, if the plant is very sick, is there a way, a product, etc.
[06:52.030 --> 06:53.130]  that would save it?
[06:53.130 --> 06:58.330]  Let's just say new lockout or over hot or stunted growth.
[06:58.330 --> 06:58.830]  Okay.
[06:58.930 --> 07:03.230]  Um, it kind of depends on how bad the plant is.
[07:03.230 --> 07:07.730]  First of all, it kind of depends on how bad I need the plant.
[07:07.730 --> 07:12.730]  Honestly, it depends on how far along the plant is.
[07:12.730 --> 07:16.430]  Honestly, it depends on, is it the personal grow or the commercial grow?
[07:16.630 --> 07:18.330]  Is it life or death?
[07:18.330 --> 07:21.030]  Or is it a breeding project that's kind of just for fun?
[07:21.530 --> 07:26.230]  I've got the honor, the privilege, the blessing to be able to, if I'm growing
[07:26.330 --> 07:30.130]  a crop and I'm not happy with the way it looks, I can scrap it and it's not
[07:30.130 --> 07:31.730]  going to ruin me financially.
[07:31.730 --> 07:34.430]  I talked in a previous episode about a commercial grow.
[07:34.430 --> 07:38.830]  If they were to scrap one grow too far in, then that could ruin them.
[07:38.830 --> 07:43.030]  That could ruin the commercial grow, which would fire everybody in that facility.
[07:43.130 --> 07:44.930]  I'm just recapping that fire a lot of people.
[07:44.930 --> 07:49.530]  So in a personal grow, I've got maybe, maybe hypothetically, somebody's got
[07:49.530 --> 07:53.530]  one light and that's just going to be maybe a pound of herb, maybe two pounds.
[07:53.530 --> 07:54.930]  Maybe it's just a few ounces.
[07:55.130 --> 07:56.630]  That's when I start making decisions.
[07:56.630 --> 07:59.930]  Like, do I really need this crop or do I really need this crop?
[07:59.930 --> 08:03.630]  Or would it be less of a headache just to cut this shit down and start over again?
[08:03.630 --> 08:09.530]  So there are a lot of determining factors in my strategies here.
[08:09.530 --> 08:14.830]  In a commercial grow, I don't cut enough clones and have enough plants to
[08:14.830 --> 08:16.730]  have enough of a backup strategy.
[08:16.730 --> 08:18.130]  I'm on a tight schedule.
[08:18.230 --> 08:19.630]  I'm on a tight plant count.
[08:19.830 --> 08:23.930]  So I'm going to do a lot to try to save every single plant that I can in a
[08:23.930 --> 08:25.030]  commercial environment.
[08:25.030 --> 08:29.930]  Also, in a commercial grow, my panic button is much shorter.
[08:29.930 --> 08:33.930]  My panic fuse is much shorter than it would be in a private grow.
[08:33.930 --> 08:36.530]  In my home grow, like I said, I can lose a personal crop.
[08:36.630 --> 08:38.030]  You guys might not get some seeds.
[08:38.030 --> 08:40.930]  Mike might not get some weed for a couple of weeks, but we could lose a
[08:40.930 --> 08:41.630]  personal crop.
[08:41.630 --> 08:42.830]  Nobody's going to go bankrupt.
[08:42.830 --> 08:44.430]  Nobody's going to have to file any paperwork.
[08:44.430 --> 08:46.030]  No one needs to look for a new job.
[08:46.330 --> 08:50.430]  If I do kill a crop at this rate, I may need to look for a new job by then, but
[08:50.530 --> 08:51.430]  nobody's going to get fired.
[08:51.430 --> 08:53.030]  Nothing too crazy is going to go wrong.
[08:53.230 --> 08:58.030]  In a commercial grow, I can't let it get that bad before I start taking drastic
[08:58.030 --> 08:59.430]  measures to correct things.
[08:59.430 --> 09:02.330]  Luckily, in a commercial grow, I've got all the technology.
[09:02.330 --> 09:03.330]  I've got all the meters.
[09:03.330 --> 09:06.630]  I got anything I could imagine to help me figure out what is going on.
[09:06.630 --> 09:09.330]  Also, I've got a really good network of friends.
[09:09.330 --> 09:11.530]  People think I'm like the Wizard of Oz of growing.
[09:11.830 --> 09:15.030]  I oftentimes, when you guys ask me grow questions, I've just got a team of
[09:15.030 --> 09:18.630]  friends that I know that I can say, hey, bro, why this or why this?
[09:18.930 --> 09:21.230]  I'm willing to admit that I am not the light guy.
[09:21.230 --> 09:22.930]  I don't know anything about grow lights.
[09:22.930 --> 09:28.430]  When it comes to lumens and frequencies and all that stuff, I, my brain simply
[09:28.430 --> 09:29.130]  does not care.
[09:29.130 --> 09:30.530]  I would love to learn about lights.
[09:30.730 --> 09:34.530]  My brain and my ADD does not want to learn about lights when it comes to outdoor
[09:34.530 --> 09:35.030]  growing.
[09:35.430 --> 09:37.530]  I simply don't do a lot of outdoor growing.
[09:37.530 --> 09:38.730]  I rock a greenhouse.
[09:38.930 --> 09:40.930]  This will be my second year growing in a greenhouse.
[09:40.930 --> 09:42.230]  That's not outdoor growing.
[09:42.630 --> 09:43.130]  It's close.
[09:43.130 --> 09:44.230]  It's greenhouse growing.
[09:44.430 --> 09:47.930]  But when you ask me greenhouse growing questions, I call Jesse or when you ask
[09:47.930 --> 09:50.230]  me outdoor growing questions, I call Jesse.
[09:50.230 --> 09:51.830]  I go, hey, bro, somebody asked me this.
[09:52.030 --> 09:52.930]  He tells me something.
[09:52.930 --> 09:54.630]  I parrot that shit back to you on the show.
[09:54.630 --> 09:57.330]  I'm not the Wizard of Oz, but luckily I've got a big team.
[09:57.330 --> 09:58.430]  I've got people that I can call.
[09:58.430 --> 10:01.630]  There are other consultants that I work with that they call me too.
[10:01.630 --> 10:04.430]  They're like, hey, bro, I've got this weird fucking thing going on in my grow.
[10:04.430 --> 10:04.930]  Can you help me?
[10:04.930 --> 10:07.030]  And I'll take a look and I'll go, oh, it's because of that.
[10:07.230 --> 10:10.230]  And so we just do each other favors, just call each other back and forth.
[10:10.230 --> 10:14.030]  So my panic button, what I'm getting at is I've got a lot more resources in the
[10:14.030 --> 10:14.730]  commercial grow.
[10:14.730 --> 10:18.730]  So I will do a lot more in the commercial grow to keep those plants alive, to
[10:18.830 --> 10:19.930]  rescue them, to save them.
[10:19.930 --> 10:24.530]  And I don't let them get too far fucked up before I really start taking drastic
[10:24.530 --> 10:24.930]  measures.
[10:24.930 --> 10:28.530]  And the personal grow, I might go, ah, there's some yellowing.
[10:28.530 --> 10:31.230]  I might want to up the nitrogen the next time I feed it.
[10:31.430 --> 10:34.630]  If I see yellowing in the commercial grow, I'm going to tell everybody, bro,
[10:34.630 --> 10:37.530]  the next time we feed up the nitrogen, pay a lot of attention.
[10:37.630 --> 10:38.930]  Like there's a meeting about it.
[10:38.930 --> 10:40.030]  There's a lot of shit to be done.
[10:40.030 --> 10:43.530]  We're making sure that that nitrogen gets added the next time we might foliar
[10:43.530 --> 10:44.030]  feed.
[10:44.230 --> 10:45.430]  Like I don't let it get too far.
[10:45.430 --> 10:46.830]  It is time to take action.
[10:47.230 --> 10:50.930]  In the commercial grows, we're running cocoa with perlite, which is basically
[10:50.930 --> 10:51.630]  hydro.
[10:51.830 --> 10:55.130]  So the minute you feed, you're going to start seeing reactions, not necessarily
[10:55.130 --> 10:57.130]  the minute, but I mean, you're going to see some shit change.
[10:57.330 --> 10:59.530]  So in hydro, it can go really quickly.
[10:59.530 --> 11:05.330]  So in a commercial grow, I really, it's, I try really hard not to let them get
[11:05.330 --> 11:07.730]  to that panic mode, but I will try to pull them out.
[11:07.730 --> 11:09.730]  We've had a pretty bad mite infestation.
[11:09.930 --> 11:13.830]  One of the things that I talk about, one of my goals, one of the things I pitch
[11:13.830 --> 11:17.930]  myself as is I'm able to help get rid of bugs and problems and turn a
[11:17.930 --> 11:19.430]  problematic grow around.
[11:19.530 --> 11:23.530]  So I've been hired to take over grows that were infested with spider mites
[11:23.530 --> 11:28.130]  grows that were infested with powdery mildew and I almost have more fun
[11:28.230 --> 11:32.130]  turning a grow around than walking into a grow that's doing well and just
[11:32.130 --> 11:33.830]  keeping it going or making it better.
[11:33.830 --> 11:36.930]  I like a good fucking it sounds maybe it's because I've been grown for so
[11:36.930 --> 11:38.830]  long and it's more of a it's more fun to me.
[11:38.830 --> 11:41.830]  I like a nice challenging grow a grow that's got spider mites and powdery
[11:41.830 --> 11:44.230]  mildew and got nine bad employees.
[11:44.230 --> 11:47.530]  That's a great grow for me to walk into because I can cure spider mites.
[11:47.530 --> 11:51.230]  I can cure powdery mildew and I can get rid of nine bad employees and get five
[11:51.230 --> 11:53.130]  badass people to rock that facility.
[11:53.430 --> 11:54.630]  So it's kind of a fun thing.
[11:54.830 --> 11:56.330]  I like fixing things.
[11:56.330 --> 12:00.330]  So I don't I like being in the weeds so I don't throw shit away.
[12:00.330 --> 12:04.330]  I don't give up my there's it sounds crazy.
[12:04.330 --> 12:07.030]  Maybe I've grown so much weed that it's like I can do that.
[12:07.030 --> 12:07.430]  Sure.
[12:07.430 --> 12:08.130]  We can do that.
[12:08.130 --> 12:11.930]  We can turn rooms and cut down a crop and have that room running tomorrow
[12:11.930 --> 12:13.030]  and flower again.
[12:13.030 --> 12:16.130]  We don't never missed 12 hours of a day in that room of plants.
[12:16.130 --> 12:18.030]  It was fucking I can do that.
[12:18.030 --> 12:21.130]  So now it's more fun for me to try to go into those rooms that are
[12:21.130 --> 12:22.930]  problematic and kind of start in the weeds.
[12:22.930 --> 12:26.430]  Like I said, it's more fun to dig myself out of a hole and then try to fix
[12:26.430 --> 12:31.130]  that and then give myself so many crops to have this goal by five crops out
[12:31.130 --> 12:31.930]  of this facility.
[12:32.130 --> 12:35.430]  We'll be kicking up this much product and we'll get this much THC percentage
[12:35.430 --> 12:38.730]  and we'll get this much concentrate percentage and we'll get this much
[12:38.730 --> 12:41.730]  customer retention and I try to work on those sorts of things.
[12:41.730 --> 12:44.530]  So I almost have fun pulling myself out of the weeds.
[12:45.130 --> 12:48.530]  A lot of it is just having knowing if you've got the resources.
[12:48.530 --> 12:51.030]  Can you repair the problem knowing that you've got the time?
[12:51.030 --> 12:55.430]  Can you invest the time or is it going to be how far back is that problem
[12:55.430 --> 12:57.430]  going to set you is it going to set you two weeks back?
[12:57.430 --> 13:00.330]  Would it be easier just to cut new clones get them going?
[13:00.330 --> 13:01.530]  Maybe that is easier.
[13:01.730 --> 13:02.330]  Let me focus.
[13:02.330 --> 13:03.530]  You said new lock.
[13:04.530 --> 13:08.130]  Nutrient lockout depending on when if it's like it's usually going to happen
[13:08.130 --> 13:11.030]  right as you switch that usually happens when you go from veg into the
[13:11.030 --> 13:16.330]  flowering stage your transition phase is going to suck but your stretch phase
[13:16.330 --> 13:18.630]  is going to suck your plants are going to look like shit, but you haven't
[13:18.630 --> 13:20.230]  started getting bud set yet.
[13:20.630 --> 13:23.530]  So you've got a new lockout and you've still got like six weeks to go.
[13:23.530 --> 13:25.630]  You've you figured it out at like day 10 of flower.
[13:25.630 --> 13:27.330]  It started showing signs by 14.
[13:27.330 --> 13:28.730]  You're ready to make corrections.
[13:29.130 --> 13:32.730]  I would mix up a solid batch of nutrients that you know is correct a good
[13:32.730 --> 13:37.330]  base nutrient some good microbes in there, but your calcium your magnesium
[13:37.330 --> 13:41.630]  your phosphorus potassium molybdenum get all the good shit that you need
[13:41.630 --> 13:45.630]  and they're all the basics of perfectly balanced meal perfectly pH to the
[13:45.630 --> 13:50.530]  perfect DC and then feed that to those plants on that day and that's I would
[13:50.530 --> 13:51.930]  start correcting it from that day.
[13:51.930 --> 13:55.830]  Now, you've got six or seven more weeks to go before that plants even done.
[13:56.230 --> 13:59.230]  You're going to transition out of that shit phase where it's looking like
[13:59.230 --> 14:00.230]  it's been beat up.
[14:00.230 --> 14:01.230]  It's going to take about a week.
[14:01.230 --> 14:02.930]  Then you're going to get a bunch of new growth.
[14:03.030 --> 14:05.530]  Then you're going to get bud set and you're going to get buds.
[14:05.530 --> 14:08.630]  You haven't even started developing buds yet to do any damage to them.
[14:08.630 --> 14:13.530]  So why not just keep pushing on through if that loot new lock happens later
[14:13.530 --> 14:17.230]  on when you start adding the bloom boosters at that point, you're fucking
[14:17.230 --> 14:20.530]  six weeks in just push on through and finish the buds.
[14:21.730 --> 14:25.530]  Once you're like four or five weeks past a lot of people might just cut it
[14:25.530 --> 14:25.730]  down.
[14:25.730 --> 14:27.330]  Once you're four or five weeks into flower.
[14:27.330 --> 14:30.130]  A lot of people may consider cutting it down if they've got spider mites or
[14:30.130 --> 14:33.030]  a nutrient lockout, but you're so close to the finish line.
[14:33.030 --> 14:34.630]  Why not just push through it?
[14:34.630 --> 14:36.330]  You may not get the outcome that you wanted.
[14:36.330 --> 14:39.230]  You may not get the product that you wanted the weight the yield the
[14:39.230 --> 14:42.930]  potency the flavor the dank photos, but you're going to get a learning
[14:42.930 --> 14:46.130]  experience push on through and have something to show for your work.
[14:46.130 --> 14:49.230]  I wouldn't give up if you're in flower keep going.
[14:49.230 --> 14:53.030]  That's I never I would never want to just give up and cut my losses.
[14:53.030 --> 14:56.330]  If I've made it all the way to the flowering phase, you've done veg work.
[14:56.830 --> 14:59.030]  You've takes a lot of work to get up to that phase.
[14:59.030 --> 15:00.730]  So I always try to fix them.
[15:00.730 --> 15:03.530]  I keep saying I really enjoy trying to fix the plants.
[15:03.530 --> 15:05.030]  It's really easy to grow herb for me.
[15:05.030 --> 15:08.930]  I why not try to fix these problems and pull my way out of it.
[15:08.930 --> 15:11.430]  So if you got new lock, I would try to fix that.
[15:11.430 --> 15:13.330]  That's only going to set you back two weeks.
[15:13.330 --> 15:17.130]  If you were going to pull a pound, maybe you're only going to pull 1413
[15:17.130 --> 15:17.730]  12 ounces.
[15:17.730 --> 15:19.530]  Now, you're still going to have product.
[15:19.530 --> 15:21.030]  Don't give up some is better than none.
[15:21.030 --> 15:26.130]  The next example was over hot and stunted growth over hot.
[15:26.130 --> 15:27.130]  Let's talk about too much heat.
[15:27.930 --> 15:30.130]  As soon as you change the temperature, they'll start growing back.
[15:30.130 --> 15:32.830]  They're going to be tall and skinny and lanky and kind of pissed off.
[15:33.130 --> 15:36.130]  But as soon as you correct the temperature, they'll start growing back
[15:36.130 --> 15:41.030]  unless you meant over hot by too much food, which depending on how bad you
[15:41.030 --> 15:45.430]  roasted them, you may be able to recover them feed them a normal diet dial
[15:45.430 --> 15:46.530]  back the nutrients.
[15:46.630 --> 15:48.230]  They may recover from that as well.
[15:48.830 --> 15:50.530]  The other one is stunted growth.
[15:51.630 --> 15:54.730]  If they look super pissed off if you're embarrassed about it and you just
[15:54.730 --> 15:55.330]  want to start over.
[15:55.330 --> 15:56.930]  Sometimes you just have that feeling inside.
[15:56.930 --> 15:58.230]  You're like fuck these plants.
[15:58.430 --> 16:02.530]  If you feel fuck these plants, then just cut them down and start over because
[16:02.530 --> 16:06.230]  you're never going to give them the love and care that they deserve because
[16:06.230 --> 16:09.930]  you've already got that that fuck these plants feeling in your heart and
[16:09.930 --> 16:11.030]  you're not going to change that.
[16:11.030 --> 16:13.330]  You might try to convince yourself that you're going to take care of them
[16:13.330 --> 16:17.130]  and pull them through but once your heart and your brain decide man, fuck
[16:17.130 --> 16:21.030]  these plants it that they know it to the plants heard you say that the plants
[16:21.030 --> 16:24.530]  felt you say that and so that is the point when I would just kind of cut
[16:24.530 --> 16:26.030]  them down give up at that point.
[16:26.030 --> 16:27.830]  I have never lost a commercial crop.
[16:27.830 --> 16:31.030]  I've never cut down an entire commercial crop and given up.
[16:31.230 --> 16:35.730]  I've had commercial crops that were not up to the standards that I would like
[16:35.730 --> 16:36.330]  them to be.
[16:36.330 --> 16:38.830]  They definitely did not get posted to Instagram.
[16:38.830 --> 16:42.630]  There were no pictures, but I've never cut down an entire crop in a commercial
[16:42.630 --> 16:43.730]  grow and given up.
[16:43.830 --> 16:48.630]  I have cut down crops in my private grow because we discovered that the whole
[16:48.630 --> 16:49.530]  back corner.
[16:49.830 --> 16:50.730]  Excuse me read.
[16:51.430 --> 16:55.230]  I did cut down an entire crop in my private grow one time because Mike and
[16:55.230 --> 16:57.030]  I discovered that the back corner.
[16:57.330 --> 17:00.330]  It was winter time and this one back corner at the exterior part of the
[17:00.330 --> 17:02.130]  house that whole corner.
[17:02.130 --> 17:03.030]  I said whole corner.
[17:03.030 --> 17:06.230]  Excuse me for that that entire corner got powdery mildew.
[17:06.230 --> 17:09.530]  There were some big beefy plants back there, but we noticed the powdery mildew
[17:09.530 --> 17:10.730]  along the back wall.
[17:10.930 --> 17:12.430]  The buds were late into flower.
[17:12.430 --> 17:17.130]  I wasn't experienced and knowledgeable as knowledgeable as I am now to know
[17:17.130 --> 17:18.130]  what to have done about it.
[17:18.130 --> 17:19.930]  So we just went cut down all those plants.
[17:19.930 --> 17:21.830]  I knew that they weren't healthy.
[17:21.830 --> 17:22.630]  They weren't safe.
[17:22.630 --> 17:23.730]  They weren't any good.
[17:23.830 --> 17:27.630]  So I just cut all those down because there was so much powdery mildew that
[17:27.830 --> 17:30.930]  treating them spraying them cleaning them up still would not have made me
[17:30.930 --> 17:31.330]  happy.
[17:31.330 --> 17:32.830]  I would have felt gross about that.
[17:33.430 --> 17:36.230]  I was working as a caregiver.
[17:36.230 --> 17:40.130]  I was growing for medical cannabis patients and I was I really thought
[17:40.130 --> 17:41.130]  about a couple of those people.
[17:41.130 --> 17:42.330]  I thought about my friend Doug.
[17:42.330 --> 17:45.630]  I thought about what if I give Doug or Mike some herb that's covered in
[17:45.630 --> 17:48.930]  powdery mildew and we smoke it one of us or all three of us get sick.
[17:49.030 --> 17:51.330]  I'm going to feel like a shithead my job.
[17:51.330 --> 17:55.030]  My goal is a cannabis grower as a caregiver is to make people feel better
[17:55.030 --> 17:58.730]  and heal them not to give them a lung infection or a sinus problem or
[17:59.030 --> 18:01.130]  whatever the fuck else that powdery mildew could have caused.
[18:01.130 --> 18:02.430]  So I did cut down.
[18:02.930 --> 18:04.830]  I think I cut down 90% of that crop.
[18:04.830 --> 18:07.130]  Well, maybe we saved a few of the plants that were up in the front, but I
[18:07.130 --> 18:09.330]  do remember cutting down all the shit in the back.
[18:09.330 --> 18:13.330]  There were white Rhino plants with buds the size of footballs and we were
[18:13.330 --> 18:15.030]  really sad to cut that shit down.
[18:15.030 --> 18:17.730]  But sometimes you got to cut your losses.
[18:17.730 --> 18:21.030]  So 90% of the time I would push on through.
[18:21.030 --> 18:23.330]  I would just because it's rewarding.
[18:23.730 --> 18:27.630]  I do know that our friend girls grow to has military experience and you know
[18:27.630 --> 18:32.430]  that feeling of like I said the example being in the weeds and fucking pulling
[18:32.430 --> 18:32.930]  through.
[18:32.930 --> 18:35.830]  I know you've got that that rewarding feeling inside of you of that
[18:35.830 --> 18:37.430]  accomplishment because you're a soldier.
[18:37.430 --> 18:39.030]  We've talked about things like that.
[18:39.130 --> 18:42.730]  I know that you've got that feeling that shit feels good when you're like,
[18:42.830 --> 18:43.630]  I'm going to fail.
[18:43.630 --> 18:44.130]  I'm going to fail.
[18:44.130 --> 18:46.930]  I'm going to fail and then at week 10 you cut some shit down and you've got
[18:47.130 --> 18:50.530]  usable smokable tangible enjoyable product.
[18:50.530 --> 18:52.430]  It may not be Cannabis Cup winning herb.
[18:52.430 --> 18:57.030]  It may not be trophy weed, but you got something and without a struggle.
[18:57.430 --> 18:59.930]  Maybe it wasn't as enjoyable and you had to learn something.
[18:59.930 --> 19:04.830]  Maybe it's better to learn how to fight spider mites now than it is way later
[19:04.830 --> 19:08.430]  on when you think you've got when your grow is flowing when it's humming you
[19:08.430 --> 19:09.830]  got more expensive genetics.
[19:09.830 --> 19:12.030]  You got more expensive lights and then you get mites.
[19:12.330 --> 19:15.230]  Maybe it's good now to find that sort of shit out when you're beginning or
[19:15.230 --> 19:18.930]  maybe when you're newer and then you can learn how to fight that shit.
[19:19.130 --> 19:20.930]  So when is it too late to save a plant?
[19:21.530 --> 19:22.830]  That's really up to you.
[19:22.830 --> 19:24.530]  That is really up to you.
[19:25.830 --> 19:29.330]  If it's covered if it's got webs on it, it's might be time just to go.
[19:29.330 --> 19:30.430]  I've got spider mite webs.
[19:30.430 --> 19:32.430]  It might be time just to cut that shit down.
[19:33.230 --> 19:37.330]  If it's got powdery mildew, it might be time to cut that shit down.
[19:38.230 --> 19:41.230]  Most of the other things we can usually usually get rid of now.
[19:41.430 --> 19:43.030]  Now, I know how to get rid of powdery mildew.
[19:43.030 --> 19:44.730]  Now, I know how to get rid of spider mites.
[19:45.330 --> 19:46.430]  Prevention is key.
[19:46.930 --> 19:51.230]  Use that feeling inside of, ah, fuck, I want to give up to remind you of
[19:51.230 --> 19:52.530]  like, how did I get here?
[19:52.530 --> 19:54.030]  Maybe that's a good thing to touch on.
[19:54.230 --> 19:55.830]  How did I get to this point?
[19:56.030 --> 20:00.330]  If your plant is sick enough or new locked out or over hot or stunted or
[20:00.330 --> 20:04.230]  has bugs or mildew badly enough to where you're thinking I might want to
[20:04.230 --> 20:05.230]  cut this down.
[20:05.930 --> 20:08.230]  Think of that as like, how did I get here?
[20:08.230 --> 20:09.730]  What kind of was it neglect?
[20:09.730 --> 20:10.630]  Was it laziness?
[20:10.630 --> 20:11.930]  Was it ignorance?
[20:11.930 --> 20:13.330]  Was it miseducation?
[20:13.630 --> 20:16.330]  Was it lack of communication with the team?
[20:16.330 --> 20:17.630]  Maybe you got somebody else helping you.
[20:17.630 --> 20:20.030]  Was it lack of communication with a partner?
[20:20.730 --> 20:21.430]  What happened?
[20:21.430 --> 20:24.630]  Why did we get powdery mildew and spider mites to the level where I've
[20:24.630 --> 20:26.330]  got to cut down all of these plants?
[20:26.330 --> 20:27.330]  Think about that.
[20:27.730 --> 20:31.430]  Then see how you can prevent that from happening in future grows because
[20:31.430 --> 20:33.930]  we definitely don't want to deal with the problem twice.
[20:34.230 --> 20:37.630]  But if you get that fuck these plants feeling that is basically the only
[20:37.630 --> 20:39.430]  time that I would really cut them down.
[20:39.730 --> 20:44.830]  And sometimes I've had that like, not fuck these plants, but yeah, with
[20:44.830 --> 20:46.230]  these plants, you know, it's borderline.
[20:46.630 --> 20:49.530]  And I've pulled those crops through those did survive.
[20:50.630 --> 20:54.130]  Not every crop has been beautiful, but I've had some that have made me want
[20:54.130 --> 20:55.930]  to grab my dreads and just start yanking.
[20:55.930 --> 20:59.730]  So when is it too late to save a plant that is really up to your level of
[20:59.730 --> 21:00.430]  patience?
[21:00.730 --> 21:02.330]  How badly do you want to learn?
[21:02.430 --> 21:03.730]  How bad do you need the medicine?
[21:03.730 --> 21:06.930]  If you're in veg and you can tell like two or three weeks in that that shit
[21:06.930 --> 21:07.930]  just isn't going to work.
[21:07.930 --> 21:09.030]  Go ahead and cut it down.
[21:09.230 --> 21:11.830]  I always talk about last winter or two winters ago.
[21:12.030 --> 21:13.830]  The pandemic really fucked up my scheduling.
[21:13.830 --> 21:16.830]  I have no idea what year it is and how long it's been anymore.
[21:17.030 --> 21:18.630]  I felt like it was Tuesday for two years.
[21:18.630 --> 21:19.930]  So I'm kind of fucked up on timing.
[21:19.930 --> 21:25.730]  But at some point in life, I decided to switch from HPS high-pressure sodium
[21:25.730 --> 21:27.630]  lights to LED lighting.
[21:27.630 --> 21:31.430]  And when I did the plants looked like total shit and honestly a few weeks
[21:31.430 --> 21:32.130]  into flower.
[21:32.130 --> 21:35.630]  I just went in and cut them all the fuck down and started over because they
[21:35.630 --> 21:39.130]  were not going to do anything good from what I was seeing from those plants.
[21:39.130 --> 21:40.530]  Nothing good was going to come out of that room.
[21:40.530 --> 21:41.730]  I was going to have a headache.
[21:41.830 --> 21:42.930]  I was going to have a struggle.
[21:43.030 --> 21:45.830]  I was going to have tall shitty plants that were getting burnt by the light
[21:45.830 --> 21:47.330]  that were never going to meet my goals.
[21:47.530 --> 21:50.730]  So like week three, I just said bucket and I cut every single one of those
[21:50.730 --> 21:54.930]  plants down about 25 days into flower chopped them all up.
[21:54.930 --> 21:56.730]  Yeah, Mike was really heartbroken over that.
[21:56.730 --> 21:59.330]  But for me, it was like I can do better than this.
[21:59.330 --> 22:02.130]  And what I did was I learned how to grow under LEDs.
[22:02.130 --> 22:04.930]  I made some adjustments and I pulled through and I did it better the next
[22:04.930 --> 22:05.130]  time.
[22:05.130 --> 22:06.230]  So that's it.
[22:06.230 --> 22:07.130]  That is two crops.
[22:07.130 --> 22:12.730]  I guess that I've cut down the powdery mildew crop and the failed LED crop
[22:12.730 --> 22:15.130]  or crops that I cut down just because I wasn't happy.
[22:15.130 --> 22:17.230]  I was frustrated but that is up to you.
[22:17.230 --> 22:18.430]  How bad do you need the herb?
[22:18.430 --> 22:19.730]  How frustrated are you?
[22:19.830 --> 22:21.230]  How much do you want to learn?
[22:21.530 --> 22:23.630]  Do you have an opportunity to get more plants?
[22:23.630 --> 22:24.830]  Do you have a backup plan?
[22:25.030 --> 22:27.230]  That is something I may keep in mind.
[22:27.430 --> 22:28.330]  All right girls grow too.
[22:28.330 --> 22:31.330]  I feel like I rambled on and on about that question.
[22:31.530 --> 22:32.430]  I hope I helped you out.
[22:32.430 --> 22:34.230]  I hope I gave you some useful advice.
[22:34.430 --> 22:37.130]  It's all about your level of frustration.
[22:37.130 --> 22:38.330]  What will you accept?
[22:38.330 --> 22:40.130]  How far will you take it?
[22:40.230 --> 22:41.230]  All right girls grow too.
[22:41.230 --> 22:42.830]  Thank you once again for the great message.
[22:42.830 --> 22:46.830]  I have got time for one more quick email before we wrap this up.
[22:46.830 --> 22:48.930]  This one came from our friend.
[22:49.730 --> 22:51.530]  Oh, this one came from my buddy JH.
[22:51.530 --> 22:52.530]  What's up JH?
[22:52.630 --> 22:54.230]  You do send me a lot of messages.
[22:54.730 --> 22:57.030]  I apologize that I don't answer all of them bro.
[22:57.030 --> 23:02.130]  You send, JH I get more messages from you than I do all day long from
[23:02.130 --> 23:03.230]  everybody else combined.
[23:03.230 --> 23:06.030]  That's why when you wonder why I don't answer every one of them, nothing
[23:06.030 --> 23:07.930]  personal but just send a lot of them buddy.
[23:07.930 --> 23:10.330]  Keep them coming because you do send a lot of great content.
[23:10.330 --> 23:12.330]  I do pull some great messages out of there.
[23:12.830 --> 23:14.930]  There's some gold in all that mud.
[23:15.030 --> 23:16.430]  This one I'm just picking on you bro.
[23:16.430 --> 23:17.230]  I got nothing but love for you.
[23:17.230 --> 23:18.230]  This one goes like this.
[23:18.230 --> 23:22.730]  It says, hey Rasta Jeff, long time listener, first time caller here.
[23:22.930 --> 23:27.230]  It says when you're growing a small crop in a 4x4 tent or maybe a
[23:27.230 --> 23:30.530]  5x5 tent, what size pots do you go with?
[23:30.530 --> 23:34.330]  That is a really good, really universal, really common question.
[23:34.630 --> 23:35.330]  It does go on.
[23:35.330 --> 23:39.230]  It says would reducing my pot size from a three gallon to a two gallon
[23:39.230 --> 23:41.430]  pot help reduce stretch?
[23:41.430 --> 23:44.830]  Do you use fabric or plastic pots is one superior to the other?
[23:45.130 --> 23:46.730]  This is a great line of questioning.
[23:46.730 --> 23:47.930]  I do like this.
[23:48.130 --> 23:49.530]  Shout out to you, JH.
[23:49.930 --> 23:54.630]  When I'm growing a small crop in a 4x4 or a 5x5, what size pots do I go
[23:54.630 --> 23:56.330]  with? That depends on my goal.
[23:57.630 --> 24:01.530]  If I am running new plants and just running new shit and trying to take
[24:01.530 --> 24:05.830]  some pictures and see what we just made, I may do one or two gallon pots.
[24:05.930 --> 24:08.330]  Sometimes I may do beer cups.
[24:09.130 --> 24:13.130]  Now, honestly, we are limited to plant counts here in Colorado.
[24:13.130 --> 24:15.830]  So in a personal grow, that's going to be way different.
[24:15.830 --> 24:19.630]  We'll touch on that as the theories and the ideas of this progress.
[24:19.730 --> 24:23.530]  Keep in mind in a commercial grow, I can run as many plants as I want in
[24:23.530 --> 24:24.330]  a commercial grow.
[24:24.330 --> 24:27.830]  If you're in a home grow, follow the legal limits, follow the rules there.
[24:28.130 --> 24:31.930]  That is quite often what determines how many plants I put where is legal
[24:31.930 --> 24:32.930]  limits and things.
[24:33.130 --> 24:36.730]  So if I were to do a 4x4 and I was to put a bunch of beer cups in there,
[24:36.830 --> 24:39.630]  I may consider putting like a hundred beer cups in there.
[24:39.630 --> 24:43.330]  Maybe put like 10 rows of 10 and just space them out just a little bit,
[24:43.630 --> 24:45.130]  but I'm limited to plant count.
[24:45.130 --> 24:46.730]  So I wouldn't do that here in Colorado.
[24:46.730 --> 24:48.830]  We'll segue into what I would do here.
[24:49.230 --> 24:53.030]  Maybe you would do a bunch of one gallon pots and you could probably fit.
[24:53.430 --> 24:57.030]  I'm going to guess you could probably fit 10 or 12 of those in a 5x5.
[24:57.230 --> 24:58.530]  So I would just say 10x10.
[24:58.530 --> 24:58.930]  There you go.
[24:58.930 --> 24:59.830]  100 again.
[25:00.030 --> 25:01.730]  You're just taking up some of that cup space.
[25:01.730 --> 25:06.230]  Maybe it's only eight of those, but I would do maybe that 64 one gallon
[25:06.230 --> 25:09.030]  pots in there and that crams them in real tight.
[25:09.030 --> 25:12.630]  Then we're only vegging to about 10 or 12 inches tall and then flowering
[25:12.630 --> 25:15.230]  and getting just getting in and getting out really quick.
[25:15.630 --> 25:18.830]  So maybe you would do like 16 one gallon pots and just have them in
[25:18.830 --> 25:19.630]  there real tight.
[25:19.630 --> 25:21.630]  Maybe you could do 25 one gallon pots.
[25:21.630 --> 25:23.330]  I'm not sure how tight that would fit in there.
[25:23.630 --> 25:24.630]  I can't visualize it.
[25:24.630 --> 25:28.930]  I think I could see five one gallon pots across that 5x5 or 4x4.
[25:29.430 --> 25:32.930]  So you got 25 of them in there, but a more practical application that we
[25:32.930 --> 25:35.130]  would run in a tent and a 5x5.
[25:35.130 --> 25:42.230]  Maybe you could do 9, 12, maybe 15, maybe 16 three gallon pots depends
[25:42.230 --> 25:44.130]  on how tightly you want to pack them in there.
[25:44.330 --> 25:47.230]  If you're going to veg for a short time, put more pots in there.
[25:47.230 --> 25:50.330]  If you're going to veg for a long time, put less pots in there.
[25:50.430 --> 25:55.330]  Something that I frequently do is nine three gallon pots in a 5x5.
[25:55.330 --> 25:56.530]  That works beautifully for me.
[25:56.530 --> 25:58.130]  That gives the plants enough space.
[25:58.630 --> 26:01.030]  Let's me grow them up to about my knee high.
[26:01.030 --> 26:01.930]  Then I flower them.
[26:01.930 --> 26:03.430]  They finish it just the right height.
[26:03.630 --> 26:08.230]  So nine three gallon pots is quite often a very good, very successful
[26:08.230 --> 26:12.730]  grow, or if you're more limited on plant count, four seven gallon
[26:12.730 --> 26:15.230]  pots is beautiful in a 5x5.
[26:15.430 --> 26:18.930]  I like to do four seven gallon pots in a trellis net and pull them all
[26:18.930 --> 26:24.530]  down, or if you want to run a perpetual grow in a 5x5 environment, I
[26:24.530 --> 26:29.330]  recommend four seven gallon pots and you put one in every two weeks and
[26:29.330 --> 26:31.030]  take one out every two weeks.
[26:31.230 --> 26:33.730]  So you've got one that's in there at two weeks, one that's in there at
[26:33.730 --> 26:36.930]  four weeks, one that's in there at six, one that's in there at eight,
[26:37.030 --> 26:39.930]  and then hopefully you got a cultivar that finishes right at eight weeks
[26:40.130 --> 26:41.930]  and you can just rotate every two weeks.
[26:41.930 --> 26:44.930]  You take a plant out, harvest it, put a new plant in there and put it
[26:44.930 --> 26:45.630]  into flower.
[26:45.830 --> 26:49.730]  Four seven gallon pots work beautifully in that 5x5.
[26:49.930 --> 26:54.330]  That is probably what I would do running a small crop in a 4x4.
[26:54.630 --> 26:57.830]  You're probably looking at like a whole bunch of one gallon pots.
[26:58.030 --> 27:01.030]  I'm guessing you could probably do like 10 of them across.
[27:01.330 --> 27:02.930]  This one gallon pots are little.
[27:03.230 --> 27:05.330]  The ones I'm thinking about, you probably fit 10 across.
[27:05.330 --> 27:06.230]  That's like a hundred of those.
[27:06.230 --> 27:09.730]  If you really wanted to cram them in there, if you want some space, maybe
[27:09.730 --> 27:13.530]  do 64 and then start working up to three gallon pots where you're doing
[27:13.530 --> 27:18.330]  like maybe 12, maybe 16, maybe nine.
[27:18.330 --> 27:21.330]  It just depends on how big the plants and how much space you want to have.
[27:21.530 --> 27:23.230]  If the plants are bigger, you need more space.
[27:23.230 --> 27:26.930]  Of course, if the plants are smaller, you don't need as much space for
[27:26.930 --> 27:27.830]  them to grow.
[27:27.930 --> 27:30.030]  That does segue me into the next part.
[27:30.230 --> 27:33.930]  Would reducing my pot size from three gallon to two gallon help reduce
[27:33.930 --> 27:34.330]  stretch?
[27:34.330 --> 27:36.930]  No, I believe it would do kind of the opposite.
[27:37.130 --> 27:41.430]  I believe that the plants, they know how wide their pot is and you'll
[27:41.430 --> 27:45.230]  notice that the plants generally, unless you do some manipulating, they
[27:45.230 --> 27:49.530]  don't branch out much wider than the size of your pot.
[27:49.530 --> 27:53.030]  If you keep your plant in a two gallon pot, that's only, what's this?
[27:53.030 --> 27:53.930]  Eight, 10 inches around.
[27:53.930 --> 27:54.430]  I'm a drummer.
[27:54.430 --> 27:56.030]  That's, I'm going to say that's 10 inches around.
[27:56.330 --> 28:00.130]  If you keep your plant in a 10 inch around pot, the root base only gets
[28:00.130 --> 28:00.830]  10 inches.
[28:00.930 --> 28:03.830]  If you look up that plant, it only spread out about 10 inches.
[28:03.830 --> 28:07.630]  Maybe those bottom branches where I got real far, maybe they went 14, 18
[28:07.630 --> 28:10.230]  inches, but not much further than that 10 inch base.
[28:10.430 --> 28:13.930]  Then if you put that plant in a wider pot, you'll notice it will widen
[28:13.930 --> 28:14.230]  out.
[28:14.530 --> 28:15.530]  That is because it knows.
[28:15.530 --> 28:17.230]  It's like, I don't know.
[28:17.230 --> 28:18.330]  It's sort of a gravity thing.
[28:18.330 --> 28:21.530]  Maybe it just knows that if I get, I can't get too wide because my feet
[28:21.530 --> 28:22.630]  aren't big enough to hold me up.
[28:22.630 --> 28:23.430]  I'm 6'5".
[28:23.530 --> 28:25.730]  Maybe that's why I wear size 13 shoes.
[28:26.030 --> 28:28.130]  Need that bigger pot for that bigger plant.
[28:28.230 --> 28:29.330]  That is my theory.
[28:29.430 --> 28:31.330]  That is just my theory and my experience.
[28:31.330 --> 28:33.730]  They get wider when you put them in a wider pot.
[28:33.830 --> 28:37.130]  So they'll stretch up more if you put them in a skinnier pot.
[28:37.230 --> 28:39.730]  Also, you're probably going to put them closer together when they get
[28:39.730 --> 28:40.830]  all close together like that.
[28:40.830 --> 28:42.630]  They don't like to grow out.
[28:42.630 --> 28:43.730]  They like to grow up.
[28:43.830 --> 28:47.330]  Somebody recently asked me why plants would get angry if I put them too
[28:47.330 --> 28:49.230]  close together, why they would get stretchy.
[28:49.230 --> 28:50.130]  They're just angry.
[28:50.530 --> 28:52.330]  They're, they can't grow out the way that they want to.
[28:52.330 --> 28:53.130]  They got to grow up.
[28:53.130 --> 28:55.730]  They get stretchy trying to get to the light because the light's not
[28:55.730 --> 28:57.530]  penetrating because they're so close together.
[28:57.730 --> 28:58.430]  They're just mad.
[28:58.430 --> 28:59.830]  They want to grow out, but they can't.
[28:59.930 --> 29:01.630]  So they just grow up to fight for the light.
[29:01.830 --> 29:02.730]  There is more.
[29:03.130 --> 29:05.430]  Do you use fabric pots or plastic pots?
[29:05.430 --> 29:10.430]  In a commercial environment, I use three gallon fabric pots with 70%
[29:10.430 --> 29:15.230]  cocoa and 30% perlite with two drip emitters per pot.
[29:15.330 --> 29:18.730]  Each drip emitter comes from a different reservoir so I can feed two
[29:18.730 --> 29:21.230]  different feeds during the day if I want to.
[29:21.430 --> 29:24.030]  Lots of different controls so I can mix up a reservoir.
[29:24.130 --> 29:28.130]  Reservoir A will have one feed and Res A will have, Res B will have another
[29:28.130 --> 29:31.830]  feed so that I can feed one part throughout the day and then right
[29:31.830 --> 29:34.430]  before they go to bed, I can feed them with another thing if I so choose
[29:34.430 --> 29:37.430]  to, or I can just run clean water through one if we decide to clean
[29:37.430 --> 29:37.930]  them out.
[29:38.330 --> 29:42.530]  So in the commercial environment, fabric, three gallon fabric pots, 70%
[29:42.530 --> 29:46.130]  cocoa, 30% perlite, two drip emitters running from two different
[29:46.130 --> 29:48.830]  reservoirs so we could feed two different nutrient solutions.
[29:48.930 --> 29:52.230]  In the home grow, I switch it up all the fucking time, honestly.
[29:52.730 --> 29:57.230]  I'm currently using the tall five gallon plastic pots.
[29:58.230 --> 30:01.030]  During the the pandy shit was hard to get and those were what was
[30:01.030 --> 30:03.630]  available so that's what I grabbed from my local grow store.
[30:03.930 --> 30:06.530]  I am very versatile, very flexible.
[30:06.530 --> 30:07.930]  I can work with what I've got.
[30:08.830 --> 30:12.130]  I'd like to have some shit but those were the pots that were there so
[30:12.130 --> 30:13.130]  that's what I grabbed.
[30:13.330 --> 30:15.230]  Is one superior to the other?
[30:15.530 --> 30:17.630]  No, it's all about your goal, all about your goals.
[30:17.630 --> 30:20.330]  It's all about your goal, all about your intent, all about your purpose.
[30:20.330 --> 30:21.930]  They both have pros and cons.
[30:23.230 --> 30:26.030]  The one thing I don't like about the fabric pots is if you don't get
[30:26.030 --> 30:28.430]  them full and don't pack them up right, the water will kind of run
[30:28.430 --> 30:29.330]  out of the sides.
[30:29.730 --> 30:33.130]  But also I like that you can't over water them because the water will
[30:33.130 --> 30:34.430]  run out of the side.
[30:34.430 --> 30:36.030]  So pros and cons there.
[30:36.430 --> 30:40.030]  My friend JH, I think I answered your question, at least this one.
[30:40.130 --> 30:41.430]  I've got a lot more from you.
[30:41.530 --> 30:45.330]  Please don't get offended that I am not answering your, is that a deluge
[30:45.330 --> 30:45.930]  of questions?
[30:45.930 --> 30:47.430]  That might be what that is.
[30:47.530 --> 30:49.230]  Dude, I got nothing but love and respect for you.
