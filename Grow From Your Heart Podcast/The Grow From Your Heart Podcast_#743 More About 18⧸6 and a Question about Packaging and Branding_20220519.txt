[00:14.780 --> 00:26.250]  All right, here we go.
[00:26.250 --> 00:27.850]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:27.850 --> 00:28.850]  I'm your host.
[00:28.850 --> 00:30.570]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:30.570 --> 00:35.730]  This is episode 743 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:35.730 --> 00:38.330]  In this episode, I'm going to talk about seed packaging.
[00:38.330 --> 00:39.970]  We'll read a couple of emails.
[00:39.970 --> 00:43.410]  Before I get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great
[00:43.410 --> 00:47.590]  folks who continue to support the show on Patreon.
[00:47.590 --> 00:51.610]  Let's kick it off with a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out to my friend
[00:51.610 --> 00:52.930]  Elders Garden.
[00:52.930 --> 00:54.970]  Let's send a fist bump and a thank you shout out to Root305.
[00:54.970 --> 00:59.530]  I want to send a big thank you shout out to my buddy ADHD Grower.
[00:59.530 --> 01:02.030]  Let's send a special thank you shout out to Jay Dutch.
[01:02.030 --> 01:05.390]  Let's send a fist bump and a thank you shout out to my dude Dreadlock Farmer.
[01:05.390 --> 01:08.130]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Growman Stan.
[01:08.130 --> 01:09.550]  Special thank you to Jimmy Limmer.
[01:09.550 --> 01:11.850]  A big fist bump to my dude Kojax.
[01:11.850 --> 01:13.810]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Kwasi.
[01:13.810 --> 01:17.750]  Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out
[01:17.750 --> 01:19.930]  to my friend Danny Potts.
[01:19.930 --> 01:24.650]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:24.650 --> 01:28.170]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:28.170 --> 01:34.430]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:34.430 --> 01:37.050]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:37.050 --> 01:40.890]  And you know I do include a link in the show notes and in the video description to make
[01:40.890 --> 01:45.350]  it super easy for all of my friends to support the podcast.
[01:45.350 --> 01:49.570]  Let me start off by sending a big thank you to everybody who gave me feedback on the current
[01:49.610 --> 01:51.290]  Patreon episode.
[01:51.290 --> 01:54.690]  That's right if you're supporting the show on Patreon you were sent a link where you
[01:54.690 --> 01:58.890]  can watch a special edition Patreon only version of the podcast.
[01:58.890 --> 02:00.850]  It does feature myself and White Mike.
[02:00.850 --> 02:03.530]  We both ate 100 milligrams of edibles.
[02:03.530 --> 02:06.010]  We did get a lot of feedback on that episode.
[02:06.010 --> 02:07.950]  All 100% positive feedback.
[02:07.950 --> 02:08.950]  So thank you for that.
[02:08.950 --> 02:09.970]  I do appreciate that.
[02:09.970 --> 02:15.370]  I do want to attempt to give you more episodes like that but I need more ideas for more content.
[02:15.370 --> 02:17.450]  People have sent me some ideas, some things to think about.
[02:17.450 --> 02:19.410]  I will work those into the show.
[02:19.450 --> 02:24.370]  I don't feel like I want to do grow material on the Patreon because I want to include everybody
[02:24.370 --> 02:26.050]  and grow material.
[02:26.050 --> 02:29.250]  So if there's other stuff you'd like me to talk about, if you've got questions that are
[02:29.250 --> 02:33.530]  not grow related or something, you just want some info, some details on other stuff I've
[02:33.530 --> 02:37.370]  talked about, whatever you want to know that's not grow related we can put it on the Patreon.
[02:37.370 --> 02:38.370]  Send me that question.
[02:38.370 --> 02:39.730]  Join the Patreon.
[02:39.730 --> 02:42.730]  Check for those special edition episodes.
[02:42.730 --> 02:46.050]  Also let me give a giant shout out to my buddy Riven.
[02:46.050 --> 02:47.370]  That's right Riven Waters made that.
[02:47.370 --> 02:51.090]  If you're watching the video episode and I hope you are, if you're listening on Spotify,
[02:51.090 --> 02:57.370]  Apple Podcasts, wherever you may be listening, I do encourage you to join us on the YouTube
[02:57.370 --> 03:02.490]  channel because my buddy Riven did make a great, really cool intro video for the podcast.
[03:02.490 --> 03:05.930]  That's what you've seen for this episode and the past couple and probably for the next
[03:05.930 --> 03:08.290]  few episodes because I do like that intro.
[03:08.290 --> 03:12.970]  So big special thanks, a fist bump, a high five, a thumbs up, a shout out to my buddy
[03:12.970 --> 03:15.090]  Riven for the beautiful intro screen.
[03:15.090 --> 03:16.370]  I love that spinning cross.
[03:16.370 --> 03:18.810]  He took my logo and made it spin around.
[03:18.810 --> 03:19.810]  That is super cool.
[03:19.810 --> 03:20.810]  It made me smile real big.
[03:20.810 --> 03:22.170]  Thank you bro, I appreciate that.
[03:22.170 --> 03:23.890]  The next order of business.
[03:23.890 --> 03:27.850]  If you hear some jingling, some clang-a-langing sounds in the background, that's my new air
[03:27.850 --> 03:28.850]  conditioner.
[03:28.850 --> 03:29.850]  It's making a lot of noise.
[03:29.850 --> 03:30.970]  It's a hot day here in Colorado.
[03:30.970 --> 03:31.970]  The first real hot day.
[03:31.970 --> 03:35.650]  I'm not going to be an old man and talk about the weather, but it's hot outside.
[03:35.650 --> 03:36.690]  So I got the air conditioner going.
[03:36.690 --> 03:39.570]  I don't know if the software and equipment will cut that out.
[03:39.570 --> 03:40.770]  If not, there you go.
[03:40.770 --> 03:42.330]  Disclaimer, there's some background noise.
[03:42.330 --> 03:43.330]  I apologize.
[03:43.330 --> 03:44.330]  It's hot.
[03:44.330 --> 03:45.410]  You got to deal with it.
[03:45.450 --> 03:47.010]  Where do we go from there?
[03:47.010 --> 03:49.710]  A lot of people have been asking, where is the Discord?
[03:49.710 --> 03:52.750]  What happened to the Iry Army Discord server?
[03:52.750 --> 03:54.570]  There is a new Discord server.
[03:54.570 --> 03:58.170]  I've been talking about this on a lot of episodes, but I'm trying to get the word out.
[03:58.170 --> 04:00.690]  I would appreciate it if you share the word with your friends.
[04:00.690 --> 04:04.570]  If you had friends on Discord and they're not on the Iry Army Discord server, please
[04:04.570 --> 04:08.670]  invite them, remind them that there was a change in the server.
[04:08.670 --> 04:10.230]  We are no longer on the old server.
[04:10.230 --> 04:12.530]  If you click on that, that's a different link.
[04:12.530 --> 04:13.930]  Some things went weird there.
[04:13.930 --> 04:15.370]  We have abandoned that server.
[04:15.370 --> 04:17.610]  We have created our own new server.
[04:17.610 --> 04:19.530]  We've got a great new mod team.
[04:19.530 --> 04:25.130]  I just actually finished up an hour and 20-minute mod meeting with the Discord mods.
[04:25.130 --> 04:26.510]  Big thanks to all those guys.
[04:26.510 --> 04:31.650]  The point of this is there is a new link to the new updated Discord server in the video
[04:31.650 --> 04:33.450]  notes and the show description.
[04:33.450 --> 04:36.550]  If you want to find the new Discord server, join us on there.
[04:36.550 --> 04:38.810]  You are invited on that server.
[04:38.810 --> 04:41.510]  There's a lot of great content, a lot of great information.
[04:41.510 --> 04:45.910]  One of my favorite things is the Smokers Lounge chat where anybody can just come in
[04:45.910 --> 04:46.910]  and hang out and chat.
[04:46.910 --> 04:48.390]  It is a video chat.
[04:48.390 --> 04:52.710]  I'm there at least one night a week, sometimes twice a week depending on how busy things
[04:52.710 --> 04:53.710]  get.
[04:53.710 --> 04:54.710]  I like to pop in.
[04:54.710 --> 04:57.950]  It just depends on if I get done with my chores or maybe I'm packing up seeds, something I'm
[04:57.950 --> 05:01.270]  doing, sitting at the desk, that kind of work where I can hang out and bullshit.
[05:01.270 --> 05:05.530]  I'll just pop into the live chat, hang out with people, answer a few questions.
[05:05.530 --> 05:07.230]  Sometimes I'm just hanging out, listening to you guys chat.
[05:07.230 --> 05:10.030]  We just have normal everyday conversations.
[05:10.150 --> 05:13.550]  We talk very intensely about growing cannabis and cannabis ideas.
[05:13.550 --> 05:15.350]  A lot of interesting conversation.
[05:15.350 --> 05:18.870]  Also one of my other favorite parts is the tester tab.
[05:18.870 --> 05:23.150]  I send out a lot of tester seeds to people and they post their reports there on the tester
[05:23.150 --> 05:27.230]  tab and I love seeing what people are growing, the progress of the testers.
[05:27.230 --> 05:28.710]  I love that.
[05:28.710 --> 05:33.190]  On the Discord, you will also find tabs for most of the strains I have created.
[05:33.190 --> 05:37.150]  The users and the mods have created a tab for most of the strains.
[05:37.150 --> 05:40.350]  I say most because there's stuff that's not even put out yet, things they don't know about
[05:40.350 --> 05:42.750]  that are coming out that will be out very soon.
[05:42.750 --> 05:44.830]  Hint, hint, tease, tease.
[05:44.830 --> 05:47.850]  They've got a list on the side of every single strain that's available.
[05:47.850 --> 05:51.810]  You can click on there and you can see other growers' experiences with that strain.
[05:51.810 --> 05:55.790]  You can see their flowering photos, their grow reports, if they had problems, if they
[05:55.790 --> 05:58.270]  have questions, the answers to those questions.
[05:58.270 --> 06:03.150]  I find it to be a very great resource and a useful resource for anybody growing Irie
[06:03.150 --> 06:05.050]  genetics.
[06:06.050 --> 06:09.850]  If you are a part of the Irie Army, the Grow From Your Heart podcast community, which you
[06:09.850 --> 06:14.010]  are if you are watching or listening, I invite you to the Discord server.
[06:14.010 --> 06:15.010]  Come hang out with us.
[06:15.010 --> 06:18.410]  You never know, you may pop in on the Smoker's Lounge and I may be hanging out right there
[06:18.410 --> 06:19.410]  in the chat.
[06:19.410 --> 06:22.650]  You might see me taking dabs, you might get to hang out, you might get to ask me your
[06:22.650 --> 06:24.850]  question face to face.
[06:24.850 --> 06:26.490]  What else are we going to talk about?
[06:26.490 --> 06:29.770]  One more thing to ramble about, then we're going to talk about some of the main topics
[06:29.770 --> 06:31.650]  of this podcast.
[06:31.650 --> 06:36.210]  I got to see, if you know me at all, you know I'm a huge reggae fan.
[06:36.210 --> 06:38.330]  Not only am I huge, I'm also a reggae fan.
[06:38.330 --> 06:40.730]  I am also a huge reggae fan.
[06:40.730 --> 06:42.010]  That just works out for me.
[06:42.010 --> 06:44.930]  Yeah, I'm 6'5", with dreadlocks down to about my calf region.
[06:44.930 --> 06:48.970]  You guys, just in case you wondered how far down these crazy things go, they hit the calf
[06:48.970 --> 06:50.170]  area and I'm 6'5".
[06:50.170 --> 06:52.010]  So I am a huge reggae fan.
[06:52.010 --> 06:53.810]  I will move forward.
[06:53.810 --> 06:57.690]  A few nights ago, I got to go see with my lovely queen, Miss Dread Vibes, also known
[06:57.690 --> 06:58.970]  as Miss Zara.
[06:58.970 --> 07:01.810]  We got to go see the lovely Natalie Rise.
[07:01.810 --> 07:05.850]  If you know anything about me, you know that I smile weirdly when we talk about Natalie
[07:05.850 --> 07:06.850]  Rise.
[07:06.850 --> 07:07.850]  I think she's amazing.
[07:07.850 --> 07:08.850]  She's a great musician.
[07:08.850 --> 07:09.850]  She's a great singer.
[07:09.850 --> 07:10.850]  She's a great writer.
[07:10.850 --> 07:14.290]  I may have a little bit of a crush on her and my girlfriend is okay with that, so don't
[07:14.290 --> 07:16.010]  go snitching on me.
[07:16.010 --> 07:17.290]  But we got to see Natalie sing.
[07:17.290 --> 07:18.290]  We got to see her perform.
[07:18.290 --> 07:20.490]  It was a great show.
[07:20.490 --> 07:21.850]  Good energy.
[07:21.850 --> 07:25.530]  Something about just the recharging of the energy there that comes from a Natalie Rise
[07:25.530 --> 07:27.210]  concert felt really good.
[07:27.210 --> 07:28.450]  So big up to Natalie Rise.
[07:28.450 --> 07:29.450]  Big up to the few people.
[07:29.450 --> 07:32.610]  I saw a couple people there that knew who we were and what we were doing, so big up
[07:32.610 --> 07:34.010]  to the crew that saw us there.
[07:34.010 --> 07:36.290]  Shout out to all the great dreadlocks at the event.
[07:36.290 --> 07:38.970]  There were so many people with dreadlocks at that concert.
[07:38.970 --> 07:39.970]  I had a great time.
[07:39.970 --> 07:41.130]  You guys, go see some live music.
[07:41.130 --> 07:43.610]  We're allowed and able to go get out and see music again.
[07:43.610 --> 07:44.610]  It doesn't have to be reggae.
[07:44.610 --> 07:47.570]  If you're not a reggae fan, if you're not into that, go see whatever you're into.
[07:47.570 --> 07:50.250]  If you're into Norwegian death metal, go get your mosh pit on.
[07:50.250 --> 07:53.330]  If you're into some Celtic folk dance, go spin your legs around.
[07:53.330 --> 07:55.390]  Do your thing and have a good time is what I'm talking about.
[07:55.390 --> 07:56.390]  Get out there.
[07:56.390 --> 07:57.750]  Get into your vibes with some good music.
[07:57.750 --> 07:58.750]  Fill your soul up.
[07:58.750 --> 07:59.910]  We're able to do it again.
[07:59.910 --> 08:00.910]  Go get out there.
[08:00.910 --> 08:01.910]  It felt really nice.
[08:01.910 --> 08:03.430]  Now I'm fucking rambling.
[08:03.430 --> 08:07.190]  Let's talk about some cannabis cultivation things.
[08:07.190 --> 08:08.630]  That's what this podcast is all about.
[08:08.630 --> 08:09.630]  We've been going for a long time.
[08:09.630 --> 08:12.270]  I haven't talked about cannabis yet.
[08:12.270 --> 08:17.190]  I recently got a message from somebody who was saying that they want to start a new seed
[08:17.190 --> 08:18.190]  company.
[08:18.190 --> 08:20.630]  They said that they look up to my company, that they see that what I've been doing is
[08:20.630 --> 08:26.310]  obviously working, and they had questions about how important is seed packaging and
[08:26.430 --> 08:28.270]  how to package seeds.
[08:28.270 --> 08:33.030]  I'm going to focus mainly on seed company with branding and all that sort of stuff,
[08:33.030 --> 08:37.230]  like an official company that's going out for a seed vendor for retail sales.
[08:37.230 --> 08:39.230]  Let's think about that type of packaging.
[08:39.230 --> 08:44.350]  We'll also talk about just bro to bro, peer to peer seed exchanges and that sort of stuff.
[08:44.350 --> 08:49.650]  When it comes to commercial packaging, something that's very important is branding.
[08:49.650 --> 08:53.990]  Some people are not going to know who you are, what you're about, what your vibe is,
[08:53.990 --> 08:54.990]  what your motto is.
[08:54.990 --> 08:58.030]  They're not going to know anything about you except this package of seeds that they've
[08:58.030 --> 08:59.030]  got in their hand.
[08:59.030 --> 09:03.310]  That's the only thing that is representing your company, your seeds, your expectations
[09:03.310 --> 09:05.830]  of those beans.
[09:05.830 --> 09:08.710]  I think branding is very important.
[09:08.710 --> 09:10.230]  Have the company name.
[09:10.230 --> 09:14.510]  On my packaging, you can prominently see iRegenetics displayed at the top.
[09:14.510 --> 09:16.030]  Then it says premium seeds.
[09:16.030 --> 09:17.950]  It lets you know these are premium seeds.
[09:17.950 --> 09:20.830]  It tells you what the brand is and what is in the package.
[09:20.830 --> 09:24.070]  When you flip it over on the back, it tells you the strain.
[09:24.070 --> 09:25.910]  On the middle of the package, it says the strain.
[09:25.910 --> 09:29.030]  On the top, once again, it says iRegenetics because I want it to be redundant.
[09:29.030 --> 09:31.550]  When you flip it over, you see it's iRegenetics.
[09:31.550 --> 09:33.510]  In the middle, I use a sticker that says the strain.
[09:33.510 --> 09:35.670]  It indicates what strain it is.
[09:35.670 --> 09:39.590]  Sometimes I will put how many weeks it takes to flower on that package depending on how
[09:39.590 --> 09:41.810]  old my labels are.
[09:41.810 --> 09:42.810]  Sometimes I do that.
[09:42.810 --> 09:43.810]  Sometimes I don't.
[09:43.810 --> 09:46.390]  I should be more fluid with doing that more regularly.
[09:46.390 --> 09:49.430]  But I'll put the brand on top, the strain in the middle.
[09:49.430 --> 09:53.810]  Then on the bottom, something I find to be very important, I put my website address.
[09:53.810 --> 09:55.410]  Why not have the web address on there?
[09:55.410 --> 09:59.690]  That way, if there are any questions, any problems, anything you want to know more details,
[09:59.690 --> 10:00.810]  you can go to the website.
[10:00.810 --> 10:05.890]  On my website, there is a full report on that strain possibly with a link to a podcast of
[10:05.890 --> 10:10.250]  that strain, possibly with Discord info, all kinds of great shit linked up to it that you
[10:10.250 --> 10:13.770]  can read about the whole strain, get the info you need.
[10:13.770 --> 10:16.890]  The main things I think about are the company name.
[10:16.890 --> 10:17.970]  What's your company name?
[10:17.970 --> 10:18.970]  What are you called?
[10:18.970 --> 10:20.610]  I'm obviously iRegenetics.
[10:20.610 --> 10:22.370]  That's printed on the very front.
[10:22.370 --> 10:24.810]  It says Premium C. I created a logo.
[10:24.810 --> 10:25.810]  I did not create.
[10:25.810 --> 10:28.970]  I had an artist create me a logo big up to my artist friend.
[10:28.970 --> 10:30.370]  His name's Adam, I believe.
[10:30.370 --> 10:34.690]  They made me a very cool logo that I feel represents my brand very well.
[10:34.690 --> 10:37.610]  Obviously, the name is IRI, which is a Jamaican word.
[10:37.610 --> 10:41.370]  It's a Patois word that means ... It's got a lot of meanings to it, but basically, it
[10:41.370 --> 10:42.550]  means to feel really good.
[10:42.550 --> 10:46.090]  It's most powerful, the most pleasing feeling you could ever imagine.
[10:46.090 --> 10:50.090]  I describe it as kind of like if you're sitting on the beach or if you're sitting on a hill,
[10:50.090 --> 10:54.170]  a grassy hill and the sun is setting and you see the waves going maybe and you got
[10:54.170 --> 10:56.410]  your girl on one side and the dog on the other.
[10:56.410 --> 10:58.330]  Maybe you're smoking a fat joint.
[10:58.330 --> 10:59.490]  Everything is just cool, man.
[10:59.490 --> 11:01.090]  There's nothing bothering you.
[11:01.090 --> 11:02.090]  Nothing's wrong.
[11:02.090 --> 11:03.090]  Nothing could go wrong.
[11:03.090 --> 11:04.090]  Everything feels right.
[11:04.090 --> 11:05.490]  That is IRI, feeling IRI.
[11:05.490 --> 11:08.010]  You got the IRI genetics.
[11:08.010 --> 11:13.250]  My vibe and my brand has obviously got that Rasta, reggae, IRI sort of vibe to it.
[11:13.250 --> 11:15.610]  There's a lot of red, yellow, and green colors in there.
[11:15.610 --> 11:19.530]  Then I use a cross logo that comes heavily from Rasta culture.
[11:19.530 --> 11:22.170]  Then on the back, when we flip it over, it's got a cool little design.
[11:22.170 --> 11:25.730]  There's another little design hidden under the main design also that you may not notice.
[11:25.730 --> 11:30.330]  But then on the back, I feel like it's got my face on it and a website address.
[11:30.330 --> 11:33.690]  I feel like putting my face on there really puts a lot of transparency to my brand.
[11:33.690 --> 11:34.690]  That is me.
[11:34.690 --> 11:36.070]  I'm the guy to that brand.
[11:36.070 --> 11:38.370]  You know who to talk to when you email it.
[11:38.370 --> 11:40.410]  When you email my company, you know who you're talking to.
[11:40.410 --> 11:41.930]  You know who the customer service guy is.
[11:41.930 --> 11:43.450]  You know who made the seeds.
[11:43.450 --> 11:44.950]  You know whose ideas these are.
[11:44.950 --> 11:48.490]  You know who you're representing and whose product you're buying.
[11:48.490 --> 11:50.050]  On the top, it says IRI Genetics.
[11:50.050 --> 11:51.130]  In the middle, it's got the strain.
[11:51.130 --> 11:55.130]  On the bottom, it's got the website with my little face logo on the bottom of the packaging.
[11:55.130 --> 11:58.810]  I feel like we cover most of the important aspects that are on the outside.
[11:58.810 --> 12:03.450]  We've got branding, we've got contact info, and we've got product information.
[12:03.450 --> 12:06.170]  A lot of people will put disclaimers of some sort.
[12:06.170 --> 12:08.450]  This is a novelty item, souvenir purposes only.
[12:08.450 --> 12:10.570]  It depends on where you're shipping your product.
[12:10.570 --> 12:13.250]  That is legal stuff that I would consult your legal team with.
[12:13.250 --> 12:18.170]  I don't add that to my packages because many of my vendors will staple a card to the package
[12:18.210 --> 12:22.210]  or a big order will get one card that says whatever it needs to say depending on where
[12:22.210 --> 12:26.850]  it is going, if it's a novelty, a souvenir, a CBD, a hemp item that will be attached later
[12:26.850 --> 12:30.450]  on as necessary depending on where it's being distributed.
[12:30.450 --> 12:32.210]  The first thing I think about is branding.
[12:32.210 --> 12:33.770]  Put your brand name on there.
[12:33.770 --> 12:35.810]  This is like your business card.
[12:35.810 --> 12:40.490]  This is the one opportunity people get to identify your brand, associate it with something
[12:40.490 --> 12:41.490]  in their head.
[12:41.490 --> 12:45.050]  If you draw a dagger on it, some people may not be into that, but the people that are
[12:45.050 --> 12:47.630]  into daggers are definitely going to remember it.
[12:47.630 --> 12:51.310]  If you put a lollipop on there, some of my packages have really cool logos.
[12:51.310 --> 12:53.670]  The lollipop logo gets a lot of attention.
[12:53.670 --> 12:56.390]  The blue raspberry truffle logo gets a lot of attention.
[12:56.390 --> 12:57.950]  Orangegasm has a fancy logo.
[12:57.950 --> 12:58.990]  It gets a lot of attention.
[12:58.990 --> 13:01.110]  Those packages get noticed.
[13:01.110 --> 13:05.390]  After many strains get success, I will create a specific package for that strain, but most
[13:05.390 --> 13:09.790]  of my stuff comes in a generic package with iRegenetics premium seeds, the cross logo.
[13:09.790 --> 13:13.790]  You flip it over, it's got the brand, the strain name, and the website on the bottom.
[13:13.790 --> 13:17.070]  Keep it simple, but give all of the pertinent information that is needed.
[13:17.070 --> 13:19.310]  Then people can contact me from there.
[13:19.310 --> 13:20.830]  Kind of got rambly, forgot where I was going.
[13:20.830 --> 13:24.130]  The next thing we should think about is protecting those seeds.
[13:24.130 --> 13:26.470]  What is inside that package is the most important part.
[13:26.470 --> 13:28.010]  The branding is great.
[13:28.010 --> 13:29.710]  Contact info is good.
[13:29.710 --> 13:34.550]  Having an identity on a table filled with seed packs and your seed pack standing out,
[13:34.550 --> 13:36.710]  that is really cool, but are the seeds in there crushed?
[13:36.710 --> 13:39.550]  Because they've got to get mailed, handled, and delivered.
[13:39.550 --> 13:44.270]  Always put them inside of some sort of protective packaging of some sort.
[13:44.270 --> 13:49.350]  I buy bubble containers from a company called lacontainers.com.
[13:49.350 --> 13:50.630]  They're quite expensive.
[13:50.630 --> 13:55.510]  I buy them by $3,000 at a time, to be quite honest with you, and it is quite expensive.
[13:55.510 --> 13:57.510]  Shipping on those things is super expensive.
[13:57.510 --> 14:00.030]  They ship from LA via UPS.
[14:00.030 --> 14:01.190]  Really expensive.
[14:01.190 --> 14:03.830]  That eats up a big cost of seed sales right there.
[14:03.830 --> 14:05.470]  It's just the packaging.
[14:05.470 --> 14:08.150]  So I use the bubbles with the foam insert.
[14:08.150 --> 14:11.950]  I open up the clamshell bubble, put the seeds in there, put the foam insert over it, and
[14:11.950 --> 14:12.950]  then I close it.
[14:12.950 --> 14:17.830]  Then that goes inside of a three by three baggie with the folded card inside with all
[14:17.830 --> 14:18.990]  of the info.
[14:18.990 --> 14:20.350]  Those all slide together.
[14:20.350 --> 14:25.950]  Then, just for security purposes, for safety, for peace of mind, I like to heat seal most
[14:25.950 --> 14:27.310]  of my packages.
[14:27.310 --> 14:30.650]  If you get them directly from me, they might not be heat sealed, but if I send them to
[14:30.650 --> 14:34.190]  a vendor, I try to make sure they're heat sealed before they go out so they cannot be
[14:34.190 --> 14:35.570]  tampered with.
[14:35.570 --> 14:38.530]  If they come from me and they're not heat sealed, they came straight from me, bro.
[14:38.530 --> 14:40.690]  The only person that fucked with them was me.
[14:40.690 --> 14:43.730]  Then if you plan on reselling them or something, just tell them you got them straight from
[14:43.730 --> 14:44.730]  me.
[14:44.730 --> 14:45.730]  It should be legit.
[14:45.730 --> 14:48.250]  But yeah, I seal most of the packs that go out.
[14:48.250 --> 14:52.010]  So they are in a protective bubble in a foam so they don't rattle around too much in the
[14:52.010 --> 14:55.210]  packaging and also so they don't go flying out when you open that.
[14:55.210 --> 14:59.170]  That gets put inside of a baggie, which has got a card folded inside of it for all the
[14:59.170 --> 15:00.170]  info.
[15:00.170 --> 15:02.530]  Also, that card keeps the light out.
[15:02.530 --> 15:04.450]  Now the seeds are protected from the light.
[15:04.450 --> 15:07.510]  When that gets heat sealed, then I bundle them in packs of five.
[15:07.510 --> 15:10.510]  They go into a container that is labeled properly.
[15:10.510 --> 15:11.510]  That's how those go.
[15:11.510 --> 15:13.890]  But mainly think about branding.
[15:13.890 --> 15:18.290]  Put your brand name on there, the strain name, as much strain info as you can, and then some
[15:18.290 --> 15:19.290]  contact info.
[15:19.290 --> 15:21.330]  I think my website info is great.
[15:21.330 --> 15:24.410]  Sometimes I do include a sticker on the inside with a link to my Discord.
[15:24.410 --> 15:27.410]  So if people want to join the Discord, they can check that out as well.
[15:27.410 --> 15:30.450]  But I try not to put too many confusing things inside there.
[15:30.450 --> 15:31.570]  Now keep this in mind.
[15:31.570 --> 15:34.350]  I do come from the music industry.
[15:34.350 --> 15:39.270]  So when you look at my packaging, my packages are designed as record labels.
[15:39.270 --> 15:42.950]  If you look at an album, yeah guys, we're going that old.
[15:42.950 --> 15:44.230]  Vinyl's coming back.
[15:44.230 --> 15:47.670]  Back in the day, we had these big, this is older than me even, but back in the day we
[15:47.670 --> 15:48.670]  had vinyls.
[15:48.670 --> 15:49.670]  I grew up with CDs.
[15:49.670 --> 15:51.990]  It's a square case with a square design.
[15:51.990 --> 15:54.190]  All the CD covers were a square.
[15:54.190 --> 15:58.230]  I always wanted to be in a fucking successful rock and roll band or some shit.
[15:58.230 --> 15:59.230]  I had fun.
[15:59.230 --> 16:00.230]  I did my thing.
[16:00.230 --> 16:02.110]  But this is where I'm supposed to be is in the cannabis industry.
[16:02.110 --> 16:03.390]  But I did tour with a lot of bands.
[16:03.430 --> 16:05.270]  I did a lot of work with a lot of bands.
[16:05.270 --> 16:10.950]  A lot of my art and design and branding ideas come from the music industry.
[16:10.950 --> 16:15.990]  So it's all about catching somebody's eye and standing out and kind of identifying your...
[16:15.990 --> 16:20.430]  So in the music industry, if you're metal or some sort of hard rock stuff, use Skulls
[16:20.430 --> 16:22.830]  and like that Blood Drip sort of fucking logo, right?
[16:22.830 --> 16:24.630]  We already know what that is.
[16:24.630 --> 16:28.710]  If you use a certain kind of font, we know that you're a rap group.
[16:28.710 --> 16:31.390]  If you use a certain kind of font, we know that you're a pop group.
[16:31.390 --> 16:33.550]  You've just identified certain things with certain...
[16:33.550 --> 16:35.230]  If you see the K, you know that's Kmart.
[16:35.230 --> 16:38.310]  If you see that lady with her legs behind her head, you know that's Starbucks.
[16:38.310 --> 16:41.270]  They're just certain things inside of our brain that give us a certain idea.
[16:41.270 --> 16:45.190]  I've learned how to do that through branding through bands with my seed company.
[16:45.190 --> 16:50.630]  So I've learned how to identify myself, create a vibe and stand out with my packaging.
[16:50.630 --> 16:54.750]  So I think a lot of that came from the music industry is where I get a lot of that vibe,
[16:54.750 --> 16:56.190]  a lot of those ideas.
[16:56.190 --> 16:58.150]  If you notice, a lot of my shit looks like a record label.
[16:58.150 --> 17:02.430]  It's like the band name, the album name, you flip it over, the songs are listed on the
[17:02.430 --> 17:04.150]  back, here's our website.
[17:04.150 --> 17:05.650]  That's a lot of how albums do it.
[17:05.650 --> 17:07.270]  That's kind of how I was doing it.
[17:07.270 --> 17:08.550]  And then I found a really cool artist.
[17:08.550 --> 17:11.350]  Shout out to my buddy Kevin who does great art for me.
[17:11.350 --> 17:13.630]  Also shout out to DP710.
[17:13.630 --> 17:16.710]  But these guys do great art and then I put those on the packages.
[17:16.710 --> 17:17.710]  That makes it a lot of fun.
[17:17.710 --> 17:19.910]  All right, I've been rambling for a little bit here.
[17:19.910 --> 17:23.750]  I did say I was going to read a cannabis cultivation question.
[17:23.750 --> 17:25.310]  I do have one great question here in front of me.
[17:25.310 --> 17:26.590]  I said one great question.
[17:26.590 --> 17:28.750]  I hope you guys enjoy it as much as I do.
[17:28.750 --> 17:32.070]  This one came from our friend who calls himself used to be cool.
[17:32.070 --> 17:34.910]  Every time I read that I say, you're listening to the podcast, bro.
[17:34.910 --> 17:37.790]  So you are still cool in my book.
[17:37.790 --> 17:38.950]  Don't ever think you're not cool, bro.
[17:38.950 --> 17:41.310]  You're cool until you decide you're not cool anymore.
[17:41.310 --> 17:42.670]  It's just like getting old.
[17:42.670 --> 17:44.150]  You're not old until you decide you are.
[17:44.150 --> 17:45.150]  I'm rambling.
[17:45.150 --> 17:46.430]  Let me stay focused a little bit.
[17:46.430 --> 17:52.430]  This one says, I had five plants in my four by four, which included two orange chasm plants,
[17:52.430 --> 17:56.750]  all of them, but one orange chasm finished between 55 and 60 days.
[17:56.750 --> 18:02.190]  The remaining orange chasm appears to be within, appeared to be within 10 days of finishing.
[18:02.190 --> 18:07.630]  So to help it along, I followed your pro tip about switching the lights back to 18 six.
[18:07.630 --> 18:11.030]  Let me talk about that because maybe people don't listen to every episode.
[18:11.030 --> 18:12.870]  I've talked about this in several episodes.
[18:12.870 --> 18:17.550]  This is a technique and a method that I do use quite often when I'm flowering my plants
[18:17.550 --> 18:22.050]  at the end of flower, approximately 10 to 14 days before harvest, around the same time
[18:22.050 --> 18:23.330]  that I begin to flush.
[18:23.330 --> 18:28.170]  I put my grow lights back on an 18 hour on and six hour off cycle.
[18:28.170 --> 18:33.410]  My theory and what I've proven by doing this several times is that my buds get chunkier.
[18:33.410 --> 18:36.730]  They get more dense and they finish up more quickly.
[18:36.730 --> 18:37.810]  So that is why I'm doing this.
[18:37.810 --> 18:42.690]  I'm turning my lights to 18 six for a faster finish and a chunkier product.
[18:42.690 --> 18:45.730]  Now let's talk about what our friend is doing and what has happened here.
[18:45.730 --> 18:48.850]  I followed your advice and switch the lights to 18 six.
[18:48.850 --> 18:54.570]  I'm now on day 67 and the remaining orange chasm still looks like it's about 10 days
[18:54.570 --> 18:55.970]  from finishing.
[18:55.970 --> 19:00.050]  I'm not sure what to do if it doesn't finish within the 14 days of the light switch.
[19:00.050 --> 19:04.330]  Can I go back to 12 12 if it's not done and then, uh, okay.
[19:04.330 --> 19:05.330]  Now I know where we are.
[19:05.330 --> 19:07.410]  It says, thanks for any advice you can offer.
[19:07.410 --> 19:08.810]  Now this is a great question.
[19:08.810 --> 19:13.890]  I'm going to start off by, um, I'm not going to scold you, but I'm going to give you some
[19:13.890 --> 19:18.510]  constructive criticism that I keep saying when we talk about the 18 six, because I need
[19:19.170 --> 19:22.070]  to get this piece of advice out and make it more clear.
[19:22.070 --> 19:25.590]  Many people have taken to the 18 six idea at the end of flower.
[19:25.590 --> 19:28.610]  It seems to be successful for a lot of people.
[19:28.610 --> 19:33.850]  One thing I want to make clear and reiterate and remind you that I think is a better practice
[19:33.850 --> 19:39.630]  is to not do this the first time you run a plant, run the plant the first time, find
[19:39.630 --> 19:44.270]  out how long that plant takes to finish, then do this the second time.
[19:44.270 --> 19:46.110]  We don't know how long that plant's going to go.
[19:46.110 --> 19:49.430]  Our dude, uh, used to be cool here, started too early.
[19:49.430 --> 19:52.630]  Now the plant is not done because he didn't know the plant doesn't have any experience
[19:52.630 --> 19:56.390]  with this cultivar and now he's got himself in a weird position and he's not sure what
[19:56.390 --> 19:57.390]  to do.
[19:57.390 --> 20:02.310]  So my very first piece of advice is don't do this on the first run with a new plant,
[20:02.310 --> 20:06.830]  run that plant once, run that plant maybe twice, find out how long is ideal for that,
[20:06.830 --> 20:09.770]  that plant to finish that particular plant to finish up.
[20:09.770 --> 20:13.870]  Then do this technique the second time and see if you can reduce the flowering time,
[20:13.870 --> 20:17.510]  have some data to compare it to the first time would be my suggestion.
[20:17.510 --> 20:19.810]  Now unfortunately we're past that.
[20:19.810 --> 20:20.910]  We can't go back in time.
[20:20.910 --> 20:23.550]  We can't grow this one more time and then figure it out.
[20:23.550 --> 20:25.470]  We've got to work with what we've got.
[20:25.470 --> 20:27.710]  So let's find a solution.
[20:27.710 --> 20:31.710]  What I would do is keep going the way that you are going.
[20:31.710 --> 20:32.710]  Keep going.
[20:32.710 --> 20:33.870]  Do not put it back to 1212.
[20:33.870 --> 20:37.830]  You've already gone from 18 six to 1212 back to 18 six.
[20:37.830 --> 20:40.110]  We don't want to confuse this plant anymore.
[20:40.110 --> 20:41.270]  That's when you may get seeds.
[20:41.270 --> 20:42.390]  That's when you may get nanners.
[20:42.390 --> 20:43.950]  That's when you may get problems.
[20:43.950 --> 20:47.070]  That's when it just may completely fucking freak out and ruin everything.
[20:47.070 --> 20:48.230]  So I would not go back.
[20:48.230 --> 20:53.150]  I would keep going until the moment I see signs of absolute revenge.
[20:53.150 --> 20:56.510]  Once you know what is for sure, reveging on you, that's when I would cut down.
[20:56.510 --> 20:57.990]  You should be flushing already.
[20:57.990 --> 21:00.790]  So it's going to be ready to cut whenever you're ready to cut it.
[21:00.790 --> 21:05.230]  So as soon as you see that revenge cut, but, um, it'll take a little bit.
[21:05.230 --> 21:07.670]  It's not going to happen to revenge right away.
[21:07.670 --> 21:08.990]  You've got a pretty strong plant.
[21:08.990 --> 21:12.550]  If it's still taking a, if it's still taking time to finish, that means it will take longer
[21:12.550 --> 21:14.310]  to revenge as well.
[21:14.310 --> 21:15.990]  That's just a commonality in the genetics.
[21:15.990 --> 21:18.830]  If it takes longer to finish, it will take longer to revenge.
[21:18.830 --> 21:20.350]  So that's a good thing.
[21:20.350 --> 21:21.350]  Keep it going.
[21:21.350 --> 21:22.790]  Wait until you see signs of revenge.
[21:22.790 --> 21:24.350]  You've got more than the 14 days.
[21:24.350 --> 21:27.670]  I say 10 to 14 because that is ideal.
[21:27.670 --> 21:34.110]  You won't see signs of revenge until at least 1721, maybe 2426 days.
[21:34.110 --> 21:35.630]  Pay attention to the plant, keep going.
[21:35.630 --> 21:38.610]  And as soon as you see that revenge, then cut it down.
[21:38.610 --> 21:40.170]  That's what I would do.
[21:40.170 --> 21:42.530]  Um, I would not do the 1212.
[21:42.530 --> 21:43.530]  It's had enough.
[21:43.530 --> 21:45.170]  I said this before, it's already stressed out.
[21:45.170 --> 21:46.170]  It's already had enough.
[21:46.170 --> 21:47.370]  Uh, it will get confused.
[21:47.370 --> 21:48.370]  It'll get pissed off.
[21:48.370 --> 21:49.850]  I don't know what it will do.
[21:49.850 --> 21:55.370]  Uh, if you put it back under 1212, that really could freak that plant out.
[21:55.370 --> 21:59.490]  So I think, uh, the number one thing to take away from this and my dude, I know it's already
[21:59.490 --> 22:00.490]  too late.
[22:00.490 --> 22:03.810]  We can't go back in time, but the number one thing that I would take away from this is
[22:03.810 --> 22:08.210]  do not do this with new cuts that we don't know how long they take to finish because
[22:08.210 --> 22:11.610]  that is how you run into this exact situation to wrap it up.
[22:11.610 --> 22:14.130]  I would keep going until you see signs of revenge.
[22:14.130 --> 22:17.530]  Uh, revenge will be little leaves poking out of the top of the buds.
[22:17.530 --> 22:20.330]  Uh, the bottom leaves will start curling up kind of weird.
[22:20.330 --> 22:23.610]  I would keep going until you see that, uh, you're already flushing.
[22:23.610 --> 22:25.450]  So it'll be clean by the time you cut it down.
[22:25.450 --> 22:30.370]  Uh, as soon as you see that, uh, revenge starting, cut it down unless it gets ready before that,
[22:30.370 --> 22:31.370]  which it might.
[22:31.370 --> 22:32.850]  That's another thing I wanted to touch on.
[22:32.850 --> 22:37.010]  Uh, since you're going at this light pace, it is finishing more rapidly than you think.
[22:37.010 --> 22:39.650]  Uh, you're saying it appeared to be within 10 days.
[22:39.650 --> 22:41.570]  Uh, it looks like it's still 10 days.
[22:41.570 --> 22:46.490]  Uh, if it doesn't finish within the 14, within the next few days, this plan is going to show
[22:46.490 --> 22:47.490]  a lot of progress.
[22:47.490 --> 22:48.690]  It is getting a lot of light.
[22:48.690 --> 22:52.450]  It is going to progress much more quickly than you're anticipating because it is at
[22:52.450 --> 22:53.450]  the end.
[22:53.450 --> 22:56.130]  Uh, if it's not already turning yellow, the leaves are getting droopy.
[22:56.130 --> 22:57.530]  That will happen very soon.
[22:57.530 --> 23:02.050]  Uh, it will begin to go into senescence and it will be done, uh, before too long, just
[23:02.050 --> 23:06.550]  naturally because the plant knows that it's just about time for that plant to be done.
[23:06.590 --> 23:08.510]  So I think you'll be all right.
[23:08.510 --> 23:12.270]  And if not, you're going to have to cut down a plant that is a little bit too early.
[23:12.270 --> 23:16.150]  It's not quite done, but, uh, that's a learning lesson.
[23:16.150 --> 23:20.550]  And if you cut down orange chasm, I think you'll still have, if you cut down orange
[23:20.550 --> 23:23.070]  chasm too early, I think you'll still be happy.
[23:23.070 --> 23:26.150]  You'll still have a satisfying outcome because it's still going to be a head ringer of a
[23:26.150 --> 23:29.510]  buzz that sativa buzz is really strong when he cut it down early.
[23:29.510 --> 23:33.630]  So even if it's a little bit early, you still may get a real head ripping psychedelic sativa
[23:33.630 --> 23:38.390]  buzz out of that, even though it didn't finish as long as we could have let it go.
[23:38.390 --> 23:39.390]  My dude used to be cool.
[23:39.390 --> 23:40.670]  It's been great hearing from you.
[23:40.670 --> 23:42.630]  I haven't gotten a message from you in a while.
[23:42.630 --> 23:44.110]  Hope everything is iry.
[23:44.110 --> 23:45.230]  Let me know how things go.
[23:45.230 --> 23:47.510]  Let me know when you finally cut this plant down.
[23:47.510 --> 23:49.910]  Let me know how it looked, how it smoked, how it tasted.
[23:49.910 --> 23:51.630]  Let me know if you got any reveg.
[23:51.630 --> 23:52.630]  Let me know.
[23:52.630 --> 23:53.630]  I want a feedback report.
[23:53.630 --> 23:54.630]  Uh, thank you, bro.
[23:54.630 --> 23:55.630]  I do appreciate that.
[23:55.630 --> 23:57.870]  All right, we've got one more breeding question here.
[23:57.870 --> 23:59.550]  This one came from our friend.
[23:59.550 --> 24:01.710]  Uh, no need to give me a shout out.
[24:01.710 --> 24:02.710]  We know who I am.
[24:02.790 --> 24:03.790]  This is my dude.
[24:03.790 --> 24:04.790]  Thank you.
[24:04.790 --> 24:06.230]  Uh, he wants to remain anonymous.
[24:06.230 --> 24:10.830]  So we're going to quickly read this message and it says, Rasta Jeff, you bad motherfucker.
[24:10.830 --> 24:13.030]  I hope all is well in your corner of the world.
[24:13.030 --> 24:17.670]  I'd like to start off by saying thank you for providing high quality content, practical
[24:17.670 --> 24:22.190]  and reliable advice and at the best price the internet has to offer.
[24:22.190 --> 24:23.470]  Dude, thank you.
[24:23.470 --> 24:24.710]  That is a great way to start a message.
[24:24.710 --> 24:26.110]  I appreciate that.
[24:26.110 --> 24:27.950]  Um, you're welcome.
[24:27.950 --> 24:28.950]  High quality content.
[24:28.950 --> 24:29.950]  I appreciate that.
[24:29.950 --> 24:31.670]  That's a lot of work, practical and reliable.
[24:31.670 --> 24:32.670]  That's what it's all about.
[24:32.670 --> 24:35.310]  I know a lot of people on the internet are giving crazy fucking advice.
[24:35.310 --> 24:37.750]  Keep it simple stoner and then the best price.
[24:37.750 --> 24:39.030]  Yes, the show is free.
[24:39.030 --> 24:41.550]  I do appreciate it that you notice that the show is free.
[24:41.550 --> 24:45.510]  Uh, some people are bothered that I do ask for Patreon contributions, but there are,
[24:45.510 --> 24:48.350]  nobody's forcing anybody in the people that do contribute.
[24:48.350 --> 24:49.350]  Seem grateful.
[24:49.350 --> 24:50.390]  So thank you for that.
[24:50.390 --> 24:51.390]  Let's keep moving.
[24:51.390 --> 24:56.070]  It says leading to the question, I found two plants that I've selected to breed for very
[24:56.070 --> 24:58.110]  different yet specific reasons.
[24:58.110 --> 24:59.190]  And then he talks about the plants.
[24:59.190 --> 25:01.190]  I don't think I'm going to talk too much about that.
[25:01.350 --> 25:03.790]  Um, he says one has lateral branches.
[25:03.790 --> 25:05.590]  Okay, we can skip a lot of this.
[25:05.590 --> 25:08.110]  It says the second plant, they talk about the second plant.
[25:08.110 --> 25:11.310]  Now I know the answer to this question is which is why I'm able to skip over some of
[25:11.310 --> 25:12.310]  this.
[25:12.310 --> 25:13.310]  I did pre read this.
[25:13.310 --> 25:14.310]  It goes on.
[25:14.310 --> 25:17.390]  It says, I know part of this was covered in a previous episode, but I cannot seem to find
[25:17.390 --> 25:18.390]  it.
[25:18.390 --> 25:21.390]  But which of these plants should I reverse?
[25:21.390 --> 25:26.030]  My goal is basically to get buds and turps as well as the shorter flowering time from
[25:26.030 --> 25:30.870]  the tall skinny one and get the structure and vigor from the short one.
[25:31.550 --> 25:35.630]  It seems logical to reverse the taller one as it will seem it will have an easier time
[25:35.630 --> 25:37.830]  pollinating the shorter plant more thoroughly.
[25:37.830 --> 25:40.270]  That's a good logical approach to that.
[25:40.270 --> 25:44.670]  But I'm not sure the best way to go just because it seems to make sense to me.
[25:44.670 --> 25:45.670]  I attached picks.
[25:45.670 --> 25:46.670]  I did.
[25:46.670 --> 25:47.670]  He goes on to say, I did attach picks.
[25:47.670 --> 25:48.670]  I did look at the pictures.
[25:48.670 --> 25:50.630]  I'll have some feedback on that.
[25:50.630 --> 25:54.810]  It says respectively, and I hope they give you a better, uh, mean to my goals.
[25:54.810 --> 25:55.990]  Thank you for the time, bro.
[25:55.990 --> 25:57.550]  Any advice would mean a lot to me.
[25:57.550 --> 26:00.710]  I'll be sure to give my mom a hug for both of us as well.
[26:00.710 --> 26:01.710]  P.S.
[26:01.710 --> 26:02.710]  Okay.
[26:02.710 --> 26:03.710]  And then he said, there's no need to give him a shout out.
[26:03.710 --> 26:07.790]  So I skipped a lot of the plant description here because in this message, your plant descriptions
[26:07.790 --> 26:10.190]  are not super important to the audience.
[26:10.190 --> 26:11.190]  I know what your goal is.
[26:11.190 --> 26:12.190]  I know what you're going for.
[26:12.190 --> 26:14.270]  I don't need to read the long descriptions here.
[26:14.270 --> 26:15.430]  You've got the right idea.
[26:15.430 --> 26:20.190]  I think you answered your own question with your own intuition.
[26:20.190 --> 26:23.710]  You said it seems logical to reverse the taller one.
[26:23.710 --> 26:25.550]  Something inside of you is saying to do that.
[26:25.550 --> 26:30.710]  And if you don't do that, you're always going to wonder what you would have done if you,
[26:30.710 --> 26:33.590]  what you would have done if you did that and didn't do the other thing.
[26:33.590 --> 26:36.990]  So my first advice is always follow your intuition.
[26:36.990 --> 26:41.730]  If something inside of you says to reverse that one as a breeder, as a plant grower,
[26:41.730 --> 26:45.910]  as the person in charge of this product, as the artist involved here, do what your heart
[26:45.910 --> 26:48.830]  is telling you to do, what your intuition says.
[26:48.830 --> 26:52.950]  When it comes to breeding, I often say, learn about Mendel charts, learn about aliel charts,
[26:52.950 --> 26:57.270]  learn about dominant and recessive genes, learn about co-dominant genes, learn about
[26:57.270 --> 27:01.030]  filial generations, learn how to label things.
[27:01.030 --> 27:05.230]  Then once you've got all that stuff figured out, forget about it and grow from your heart
[27:05.230 --> 27:07.830]  and breed with love and use your intuition.
[27:07.830 --> 27:11.430]  When you look at two plants in a grow room, something's going to go, man, if that plant
[27:11.430 --> 27:15.230]  and that plant got together and made seeds and made plants, they would be amazing.
[27:15.230 --> 27:16.230]  Do that.
[27:16.230 --> 27:20.670]  It seems like you're on that path, which is the passion, the desire, the grow from your
[27:20.670 --> 27:22.010]  heart, the breed with love.
[27:22.070 --> 27:24.450]  That's the most important part of it.
[27:24.450 --> 27:26.890]  Then seeing what comes out of it is the most fun.
[27:26.890 --> 27:31.850]  If you are making a project that is assigned by me, that's an assignment, that's work.
[27:31.850 --> 27:34.010]  That's a project that you're just doing.
[27:34.010 --> 27:35.230]  Do what you love to do.
[27:35.230 --> 27:37.730]  Do what your heart is calling for you to do.
[27:37.730 --> 27:42.970]  Also, my next piece of advice is do the other way also, because this isn't going to be your
[27:42.970 --> 27:45.630]  last time breeding seeds, your only time breeding.
[27:45.630 --> 27:47.490]  Do them both and see what they both do.
[27:47.490 --> 27:50.010]  Then in the future, breed them together.
[27:50.010 --> 27:51.010]  I know it sounds crazy.
[27:51.010 --> 27:54.730]  It sounds like a lot, but as a breeder who's way ahead of you in this breeding game, who
[27:54.730 --> 27:58.170]  knows how this ... I don't want to say addiction, but that's how this addiction goes.
[27:58.170 --> 27:59.730]  That's how this passion goes.
[27:59.730 --> 28:03.370]  You're going to make some seeds out of plant A to plant B, and you're going to grow them,
[28:03.370 --> 28:06.850]  and you're going to go, hmm, and you're going to do plant B to plant A, and you're going
[28:06.850 --> 28:09.370]  to grow them, and then you're going to see two plants in there, and you're going to go,
[28:09.370 --> 28:14.530]  oh shit, and then you're going to cross those, and that one is going to be your fucking mastermind
[28:14.530 --> 28:15.530]  right there.
[28:15.530 --> 28:18.850]  That's going to be the ninja samurai warrior Yoda Buddha right there that you're looking
[28:18.850 --> 28:19.850]  for.
[28:20.050 --> 28:24.690]  My first advice is use your intuition, follow your heart, do what your heart told you to
[28:24.690 --> 28:25.690]  do.
[28:25.690 --> 28:29.170]  If not, that's almost a lot of things in life.
[28:29.170 --> 28:30.170]  Follow your heart.
[28:30.170 --> 28:33.850]  Use your intuition, because if you don't, if there's something that you want to do and
[28:33.850 --> 28:36.930]  you don't do it, when you're too old to do it, you're going to be like, fuck, I should
[28:36.930 --> 28:37.930]  have done that.
[28:37.930 --> 28:40.210]  I wish I would have done that.
[28:40.210 --> 28:43.010]  You're going to really ... That's when you have regrets, is when you don't do the shit
[28:43.010 --> 28:44.270]  that you thought you should do.
[28:44.270 --> 28:45.270]  Get that shit done.
[28:45.270 --> 28:46.850]  Do the one you had the idea for.
[28:46.850 --> 28:49.170]  Use that taller one as your first pollinator.
[28:49.490 --> 28:51.330]  Then again, the second time, reverse that shit.
[28:51.330 --> 28:54.570]  Do the other one and let that tall one receive pollen.
[28:54.570 --> 28:59.010]  Also, it really depends on who ... We don't know this until we breed.
[28:59.010 --> 29:02.850]  We don't know which plant has dominant and recessive and co-dominant traits.
[29:02.850 --> 29:05.290]  We don't know which traits are going to take over the mix.
[29:05.290 --> 29:06.970]  You've never bred with either one of these plants.
[29:06.970 --> 29:10.730]  We don't know what either one of them adds, so we don't know what to expect.
[29:10.730 --> 29:15.890]  You could possibly, and this is just hypothetical, you could reverse plant A and pollinate plant
[29:15.890 --> 29:21.130]  B and the outcome could either be all plant A or all plant B. You could do the opposite
[29:21.130 --> 29:23.970]  and both of those effects could be the outcome.
[29:23.970 --> 29:28.370]  Or you could reverse plant A and pollinate plant B and it could be a 50-50 mix.
[29:28.370 --> 29:32.530]  You could reverse plant B and pollinate A and it could be 70-30 on the outcome on the
[29:32.530 --> 29:33.650]  phenotypes.
[29:33.650 --> 29:35.330]  We don't know what they're offering.
[29:35.330 --> 29:37.450]  It could be all intersex plants.
[29:37.450 --> 29:41.490]  It could be all intersex if you do it one way and all solid fems if you do it the other
[29:41.490 --> 29:42.490]  way.
[29:43.010 --> 29:46.170]  We just have to breed with these plants is really the only true way to find out.
[29:46.170 --> 29:50.610]  You have to breed them, make the crosses, grow them, take a lot of notes and pay a lot
[29:50.610 --> 29:51.610]  of attention.
[29:51.610 --> 29:53.490]  But that is where the passion comes from.
[29:53.490 --> 29:55.670]  That is what the passion is all about.
[29:55.670 --> 29:59.610]  That's why we're growing from our heart and breeding with love.
[29:59.610 --> 30:03.730]  My dude who wants to remain anonymous, I really hope I gave you some useful advice.
[30:03.730 --> 30:07.050]  My main piece of advice with this one is follow your intuition.
[30:07.050 --> 30:09.630]  Do the thing that first inspired you to do this.
[30:09.630 --> 30:14.190]  And you got the rest of your life to do the rest of the projects I recommended.
[30:14.190 --> 30:18.270]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers,
