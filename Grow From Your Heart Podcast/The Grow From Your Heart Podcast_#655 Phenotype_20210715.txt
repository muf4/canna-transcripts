[00:00.000 --> 00:08.720]  Welcome to the show podcast world.
[00:08.720 --> 00:09.720]  I'm your host.
[00:09.720 --> 00:17.040]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff and this is episode 655 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:17.040 --> 00:20.720]  In this episode, we're going to focus on the word phenotype and talk about what phenotype
[00:20.720 --> 00:24.080]  means and talk a little bit about phenotype selection.
[00:24.080 --> 00:27.760]  Before we get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of the kind folks
[00:28.300 --> 00:32.600]  Show on patreon, let's start off with a big grow from your heart podcast thank you show
[00:32.600 --> 00:34.300]  up to a brand new supporter.
[00:34.300 --> 00:38.120]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Terry P. I want to send a big thank you shout out
[00:38.120 --> 00:39.420]  to a longtime supporter.
[00:39.420 --> 00:41.440]  Let's send a special thank you shout out to magic Mike.
[00:41.440 --> 00:44.600]  I want to send a big thank you shout out to my buddy Guido.
[00:44.600 --> 00:47.440]  Let's send a big fist bump and a thank you shout out to Justin smoking.
[00:47.440 --> 00:51.560]  If you want to send a big thank you shout out to a longtime supporter grams mammal.
[00:51.560 --> 00:53.740]  Let's send a big fist bump to the cano crack.
[00:53.740 --> 00:55.620]  Let's send a big thank you to 716 groves.
[00:55.620 --> 00:58.680]  I want to send a big high five to Noah N.

[01:02.740 --> 01:05.380]  I want to send a big thank you to Mr. Mean Green.
[01:05.380 --> 01:09.740]  And then let's wrap up the thank you and shout out portion of the podcast by sending a big
[01:09.740 --> 01:13.180]  thank you shout out to my buddy OG Purple Thumb.
[01:13.180 --> 01:16.940]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show.

[01:49.580 --> 01:53.300]  And yes, I did correct that link in a previous episode.
[01:53.300 --> 01:56.820]  A couple of previous episodes, the link was dead, I put in the wrong link.
[01:56.820 --> 01:58.140]  I apologize for that.
[01:58.140 --> 02:01.820]  I have corrected the link you can now get to the Patreon.
[02:01.820 --> 02:04.660]  Also big thanks to everybody for the Patreon support.
[02:04.660 --> 02:06.080]  I know I say that a lot.
[02:06.080 --> 02:10.420]  We are hovering around 225 faithful patrons.
[02:10.420 --> 02:11.420]  That means a lot to me.
[02:11.420 --> 02:12.420]  That is overwhelming.
[02:12.420 --> 02:13.420]  That is tremendous.
[02:13.420 --> 02:14.420]  That's delightful.
[02:14.420 --> 02:15.760]  I don't even know what to say about that.
[02:15.760 --> 02:19.960]  So thank you to all 225 of the patrons.
[02:19.960 --> 02:21.040]  That is amazing.
[02:21.040 --> 02:22.040]  Thank you.
[02:22.040 --> 02:23.720]  All right, what else do we want to talk about?
[02:23.720 --> 02:28.160]  I don't want to dwell on it too long, but it has been super warm outside.
[02:28.160 --> 02:33.120]  I want to send a big respect shout out to all of the folks growing outdoors.
[02:33.120 --> 02:36.920]  If you're growing ganja outdoors, if you're growing fruits and vegetables outdoors, big
[02:36.920 --> 02:38.420]  shout out, big respect.
[02:38.420 --> 02:40.120]  Thank you for the hard work and dedication.
[02:40.120 --> 02:41.120]  It is hot.
[02:41.120 --> 02:42.120]  It is tremendous.
[02:42.120 --> 02:43.520]  It is sweltering hot out there.
[02:43.520 --> 02:45.240]  Man, good work.
[02:45.240 --> 02:46.440]  Big shout out, much respect.
[02:46.440 --> 02:49.360]  If you're out there growing, if you're doing construction out there, if you're out there
[02:49.360 --> 02:52.320]  spinning a sign, if you're doing anything where you have to be outside for more than
[02:52.320 --> 02:55.560]  a couple of hours at a time, big shout out, much respect.
[02:55.560 --> 02:56.560]  It is too crazy hot.
[02:56.560 --> 02:57.560]  It's so hot.
[02:57.560 --> 02:58.560]  I was at a farm.
[02:58.560 --> 03:02.160]  I may have been on an outdoor farm looking at some stuff, may have been at a couple of
[03:02.160 --> 03:03.520]  greenhouses doing some things.
[03:03.520 --> 03:08.240]  We can't talk too much about that, but I was out there and I thought, I've been out here
[03:08.240 --> 03:09.240]  for a long time.
[03:09.240 --> 03:10.240]  It's really hot.
[03:10.240 --> 03:11.680]  I'm covered in sweat, getting kind of funky.
[03:11.680 --> 03:14.440]  Some wind came by and I thought, oh, that breeze is going to be beautiful.
[03:14.640 --> 03:15.640]  But I was wrong.
[03:15.640 --> 03:19.360]  That breeze came by and it just grabbed all the moisture in my body and just left with
[03:19.360 --> 03:20.360]  it.
[03:20.360 --> 03:22.320]  That breeze was not refreshing at all.
[03:22.320 --> 03:24.000]  Even the wind is hot out there.
[03:24.000 --> 03:25.240]  That is miserable.
[03:25.240 --> 03:27.840]  Big shout out to all you outdoor workers and growers.
[03:27.840 --> 03:30.720]  Also, I hope your indoor equipment is working.
[03:30.720 --> 03:32.720]  Is that air conditioner kicking in?
[03:32.720 --> 03:34.200]  Are you blowing breakers yet?
[03:34.200 --> 03:35.600]  I hope things are working for you.
[03:35.600 --> 03:40.120]  If you're running a swamp cooler, I hope you've got a dehumidifier and I hope you added another
[03:40.120 --> 03:42.460]  breaker because you're going to start flipping breakers.
[03:42.460 --> 03:43.460]  It is hot out there.
[03:43.480 --> 03:43.980]  All right.
[03:43.980 --> 03:46.100]  I did talk about I have been quite busy.
[03:46.100 --> 03:49.140]  I've been going to greenhouses and outdoor grows and doing some things.
[03:49.140 --> 03:51.500]  I've got some secret projects up my sleeve.
[03:51.500 --> 03:55.260]  I don't like to talk too much about that stuff until I've got some progress to show you.
[03:55.260 --> 03:56.900]  I will talk about that.
[03:56.900 --> 03:57.900]  Trust me, I'm excited.
[03:57.900 --> 03:59.740]  I've got some partners and some friends doing some things.
[03:59.740 --> 04:01.060]  They're all excited to share it with you.
[04:01.060 --> 04:03.340]  We're just not ready yet.
[04:03.340 --> 04:07.260]  But that is why the MailChimp newsletter is late.
[04:07.260 --> 04:08.260]  That's right.
[04:08.260 --> 04:10.660]  If you were part of the show, if you've been listening and watching for a long time, maybe
[04:10.740 --> 04:14.740]  you've signed up for the MailChimp newsletter on the website at iRegenetics.com.
[04:14.740 --> 04:19.220]  Monthly, I try to put out a newsletter, let you know about vendor updates, sales, coupon
[04:19.220 --> 04:20.500]  codes, stuff like that.
[04:20.500 --> 04:22.460]  I did not put out the MailChimp this month.
[04:22.460 --> 04:23.860]  We're around the 13th of this month.
[04:23.860 --> 04:25.260]  I have not put that out.
[04:25.260 --> 04:26.380]  I apologize.
[04:26.380 --> 04:29.420]  I've simply been overwhelmed and there was not a lot to share.
[04:29.420 --> 04:33.260]  If you've got the MailChimp newsletter last month, simply repeat that newsletter this
[04:33.260 --> 04:35.180]  month except there are no coupon codes.
[04:35.180 --> 04:37.220]  I did not make coupon codes this month.
[04:37.220 --> 04:38.300]  No sale for this month.
[04:38.300 --> 04:39.300]  Not a big deal.
[04:39.300 --> 04:42.620]  We'll get more on the sales next month on Etsy or some cool coupon codes to make up
[04:42.620 --> 04:43.620]  for it.
[04:43.620 --> 04:45.620]  But I did not put out the MailChimp newsletter this month.
[04:45.620 --> 04:48.940]  There was not much to report and I was overwhelmed with life.
[04:48.940 --> 04:49.940]  I was having a good time.
[04:49.940 --> 04:51.500]  I had a ... My daughter has graduated.
[04:51.500 --> 04:52.500]  She turned 18.
[04:52.500 --> 04:54.460]  Spent some time with her.
[04:54.460 --> 04:56.980]  We got a cool couple of events in Denver.
[04:56.980 --> 05:01.060]  I've got this new secret project going on and it is summertime.
[05:01.060 --> 05:03.700]  I have been overloaded and it has been super hot.
[05:03.700 --> 05:06.420]  I've put over 2,500 miles on my car.
[05:06.420 --> 05:08.780]  We're around the 12th or 13th of this month.
[05:08.780 --> 05:09.780]  It has been good.
[05:09.780 --> 05:11.220]  Nothing seems to be slowing down.
[05:11.220 --> 05:12.220]  I'm not complaining.
[05:12.220 --> 05:15.340]  I'm just letting you know why the MailChimp letter did not happen.
[05:15.340 --> 05:16.340]  All right.
[05:16.340 --> 05:17.340]  Where are we going to go from there?
[05:17.340 --> 05:19.060]  I think I've been rambling long enough.
[05:19.060 --> 05:20.620]  Let's talk about phenotypes.
[05:20.620 --> 05:22.860]  I've got an email here in front of me about phenotypes.
[05:22.860 --> 05:25.020]  This is a great question.
[05:25.020 --> 05:30.540]  I actually was talking on Instagram Live about this just a couple of days ago randomly and
[05:30.540 --> 05:33.820]  then this email popped up so it worked out perfectly.
[05:33.820 --> 05:34.820]  Let's jump right into it.
[05:34.820 --> 05:41.580]  Someone says, can you do a shortish video on what a pheno is and how to find a pheno?
[05:41.580 --> 05:43.500]  That is a really good question.
[05:43.500 --> 05:45.300]  I talk about phenos a lot.
[05:45.300 --> 05:50.480]  I think a great way to start this is by defining the word phenotype.
[05:50.480 --> 05:51.480]  What is a phenotype?
[05:51.480 --> 05:52.480]  I simply went to Google.
[05:52.480 --> 05:59.300]  I typed in the word phenotype and it says, the set of observable characteristics of an
[05:59.300 --> 06:03.500]  individual resulting from the interaction of its genotype with the environment.
[06:03.500 --> 06:06.380]  I'll read it one more time because I did stutter in the middle of that.
[06:06.380 --> 06:12.820]  It is the set of observable characteristics of an individual resulting from the interaction
[06:12.820 --> 06:15.860]  of its genotype with the environment.
[06:15.860 --> 06:20.020]  Let's put that into terms when we actually talk about plants to explain this.
[06:20.020 --> 06:22.300]  The set of observable characteristics.
[06:22.300 --> 06:25.300]  What are observable characteristics within our plants?
[06:25.300 --> 06:27.820]  We have leaf shape.
[06:27.820 --> 06:28.820]  We have leaf color.
[06:28.820 --> 06:32.100]  Then we have plant shape, plant structure, branchiness.
[06:32.100 --> 06:33.140]  Are they tall?
[06:33.780 --> 06:34.780]  Are they short?
[06:34.780 --> 06:35.780]  Are they squatty?
[06:35.780 --> 06:36.780]  Are they bushy?
[06:36.780 --> 06:37.780]  Are they really sparse?
[06:37.780 --> 06:38.780]  Are they super stretchy?
[06:38.780 --> 06:43.620]  These are observable characteristics of an individual.
[06:43.620 --> 06:45.800]  The individual being the plants we are working with.
[06:45.800 --> 06:48.900]  Those are all individual observable characteristics.
[06:48.900 --> 06:50.420]  This is a mouthful to talk about here.
[06:50.420 --> 06:54.780]  I apologize for a couple of stumbles, but we will get through this, I promise.
[06:54.780 --> 06:55.780]  Observable characteristics.
[06:55.780 --> 07:00.480]  Odors, aromas, those are observable characteristics.
[07:00.480 --> 07:02.780]  The buzz is an observable characteristic.
[07:03.420 --> 07:04.420]  You have to finish the plants.
[07:04.420 --> 07:09.420]  You have to smoke it to determine and discover that, but the high you get is a characteristic.
[07:09.420 --> 07:12.660]  The flavors and aromas, those are all characteristics.
[07:12.660 --> 07:14.180]  Also, reactions.
[07:14.180 --> 07:15.620]  How does it respond to things?
[07:15.620 --> 07:17.440]  That is something we can observe.
[07:17.440 --> 07:22.480]  If I take two plants and I pop and twist this one and pop and twist this one, they may react
[07:22.480 --> 07:23.580]  differently.
[07:23.580 --> 07:29.500]  That is an observable characteristic of that individual resulting from the interaction
[07:29.500 --> 07:32.100]  of its genotype with the environment.
[07:32.100 --> 07:35.860]  Let's talk more about the interaction of its genotype with the environment.
[07:35.860 --> 07:39.340]  That's a big part right there.
[07:39.340 --> 07:43.180]  Observable characteristics that result from the interaction of its genotype with the environment.
[07:43.180 --> 07:46.700]  I think the next move is to go define the word genotype.
[07:46.700 --> 07:49.100]  What does genotype mean?
[07:49.100 --> 07:54.540]  Genotype is the genetic constitution of an individual organism.
[07:54.540 --> 07:59.880]  That is the ingredients of the organism, the plant, the ingredients of the plant.
[07:59.880 --> 08:04.040]  If this were going to be a cake, these would be the cake ingredients.
[08:04.040 --> 08:07.560]  The phenotype is what happens when we bake this cake.
[08:07.560 --> 08:10.960]  Do we burn it or do we cook it just right or do we freeze it?
[08:10.960 --> 08:14.720]  These are interactions of the genotype with its environment.
[08:14.720 --> 08:18.120]  The environment is the grow room in which we are putting it in.
[08:18.120 --> 08:21.080]  We've got a genotype that's got certain genes in it.
[08:21.080 --> 08:25.100]  They're going to express differently in different environments.
[08:25.100 --> 08:32.180]  If I took the same plant, if I took 10 clones of the same plant, all healthy clones, I rooted
[08:32.180 --> 08:37.020]  them all the same, they were all the same size, they were all equal in all ways, and
[08:37.020 --> 08:43.420]  I gave them to 10 different growers, we're going to see 10, not completely different
[08:43.420 --> 08:46.940]  growers, but we're going to see 10 different outcomes from these plants.
[08:46.940 --> 08:50.660]  Some are going to be stickier, some are going to be sweeter, some will be more dense, some
[08:50.660 --> 08:52.020]  will be more airy.
[08:52.020 --> 08:56.980]  You're just going to see very typical differences from different grow rooms.
[08:56.980 --> 09:02.780]  This is the phenotypical expression, which is the characteristics of an individual resulting
[09:02.780 --> 09:06.780]  from its interaction of its genotype with the environment.
[09:06.780 --> 09:07.780]  We can shorten that.
[09:07.780 --> 09:11.960]  We can say this is what the plant is expressing because of its environment.
[09:11.960 --> 09:17.780]  This particular plant does these particular things in this type of environment.
[09:17.780 --> 09:23.860]  That's how I know that some of my plants really like it when it gets super cool or
[09:23.860 --> 09:26.460]  super hot or super dry.
[09:26.460 --> 09:31.100]  That's when you start learning characteristics because you start observing those characteristics
[09:31.100 --> 09:32.260]  of an individual plant.
[09:32.260 --> 09:36.300]  Then you start learning how to make it express certain things or stop it from expressing
[09:36.300 --> 09:37.580]  certain things.
[09:37.580 --> 09:43.940]  We know that if we want plants to turn purple toward the end, we can make them cold.
[09:43.940 --> 09:51.340]  That is a phenotypical expression directly related to its interaction to response from
[09:51.340 --> 09:53.340]  the environmental factor we put on it.
[09:53.340 --> 09:56.620]  We made it cold and it said, it's cold, I'm going to get purple.
[09:56.620 --> 09:58.500]  That's phenotypical expression.
[09:58.500 --> 10:00.900]  Not all plants will do that.
[10:00.900 --> 10:04.940]  I could take a pack of seeds and grow 10 seeds.
[10:04.940 --> 10:08.460]  Some females, some of the plants, some of the males and females, some of the plants
[10:08.460 --> 10:11.340]  out of there may turn purple, some may not turn purple.
[10:11.340 --> 10:14.660]  Those are specific phenotypes.
[10:14.660 --> 10:17.060]  Phenotype is the expression.
[10:17.060 --> 10:22.100]  We're just going to say it's the expression of those genes.
[10:22.100 --> 10:24.820]  Once the cake goes into the oven, it is how it is baked.
[10:24.820 --> 10:26.860]  Did you put it in too hot of an oven to burn it?
[10:26.860 --> 10:29.580]  Did you put it in an oven just right where it baked perfectly?
[10:29.580 --> 10:33.100]  These phenotypes are going to show you what they want from your room.
[10:33.100 --> 10:34.860]  You've got your room dialed in most of the time.
[10:34.860 --> 10:40.260]  We've got pretty good guidelines of temperature, humidity, light cycles that we want it at.
[10:40.260 --> 10:44.420]  But then your plants are going to tell you based on phenotypical selection, what is
[10:44.420 --> 10:46.500]  perfect for that plant for that room.
[10:46.500 --> 10:50.740]  That is dialing it in for that phenotype, getting it perfect for that room.
[10:50.740 --> 10:56.580]  So phenotype is the set of observable characteristics of an individual resulting from the interaction
[10:56.580 --> 10:58.300]  of its genotype with the environment.
[10:58.300 --> 11:03.300]  The genotype is the genetic constitution of an individual organism.
[11:03.300 --> 11:09.460]  So sometimes we can put a plant in a room and it will show taco shaped leaves and bright
[11:09.500 --> 11:10.500]  green colors.
[11:10.500 --> 11:14.020]  Then you can put the same plant in a different room and the leaves will not taco at all and
[11:14.020 --> 11:15.580]  they won't get super bright green.
[11:15.580 --> 11:17.580]  This is a phenotypical expression.
[11:17.580 --> 11:20.700]  If you're putting too much light on it, it may get a different green color.
[11:20.700 --> 11:22.780]  If you're making it too hot, it may do different shit.
[11:22.780 --> 11:26.140]  If you make it cold, it may curl downward instead of upward.
[11:26.140 --> 11:28.900]  This is going to be a phenotypical expression.
[11:28.900 --> 11:30.900]  I do have a bunch of notes here.
[11:30.900 --> 11:33.580]  Let's kind of talk about some of the notes that I have got.
[11:33.580 --> 11:35.060]  We're going to talk about another word also.
[11:35.060 --> 11:41.340]  We're going to talk about chemotype later, but that's a whole other conversation.
[11:41.340 --> 11:42.700]  Phenotype and how to find a pheno.
[11:42.700 --> 11:45.740]  So a phenotype, let's talk about a pheno hunt.
[11:45.740 --> 11:52.900]  When you've got a pack of seeds, there is a label and an idea of what's expected from
[11:52.900 --> 11:53.900]  these seeds.
[11:53.900 --> 11:54.900]  I'm just going to pick a strain.
[11:54.900 --> 11:59.060]  We're going to say strawberry starburst because that's really easy to pick some phenotypes
[11:59.060 --> 12:00.100]  and talk about flavors.
[12:00.100 --> 12:03.380]  When I say strawberry starburst, you've read the description.
[12:03.380 --> 12:06.540]  It says strawberry candy and funky gassy aromas.
[12:06.540 --> 12:08.500]  That's kind of the short version.
[12:08.500 --> 12:13.340]  You bought the pack because you want strawberry candy and funky gas aromas.
[12:13.340 --> 12:18.140]  Now since that plant came from a rise and strawberry starburst, we've got potential
[12:18.140 --> 12:22.820]  to see plants that look a little bit like the arise and plants that look a little bit
[12:22.820 --> 12:24.300]  like strawberry starburst.
[12:24.300 --> 12:28.580]  And then we're going to see stuff in the middle that is combinations of the two.
[12:28.580 --> 12:31.420]  You'll see some that lean a little bit more one way, some that lean a little bit more
[12:31.420 --> 12:35.340]  one way and then some that are 50% and then some that are kind of more dominant of the
[12:35.340 --> 12:36.340]  other.
[12:36.340 --> 12:38.380]  That's just how breeding works when you make an F1.
[12:38.380 --> 12:43.500]  There'll be probably four or five main phenotypes you can identify from that.
[12:43.500 --> 12:46.820]  Now which phenotype do you want is the main question.
[12:46.820 --> 12:49.860]  When they grow, they're going to show a little bit different expression.
[12:49.860 --> 12:53.460]  You already know that you want this strain because you've selected it.
[12:53.460 --> 12:54.580]  You've paid the money for it.
[12:54.580 --> 12:55.580]  You read the description.
[12:55.580 --> 12:57.460]  It's got traits that you're after.
[12:57.460 --> 12:59.820]  Nothing was desirable in this plant.
[12:59.820 --> 13:04.180]  Now we've just got to find the perfect one for you.
[13:04.180 --> 13:08.460]  Do you want the one that grows a little bit taller and takes a little bit longer but puts
[13:08.460 --> 13:13.020]  out more potency and more buds or do you want the one that stays short and squatty and gives
[13:13.020 --> 13:18.060]  you a real head buzz or a real make sure ears ring if you're so high when you smoke it or
[13:18.060 --> 13:24.420]  do you want the one that doesn't grow very tall but makes super strawberry candy buds.
[13:24.420 --> 13:30.900]  It's up to you at that point to see which phenotype works best for you for your garden.
[13:30.900 --> 13:33.460]  I don't know if you're growing for yourself to smoke medically.
[13:33.460 --> 13:35.900]  I don't know if you're growing for yourself to smoke recreationally.
[13:35.900 --> 13:39.620]  I don't know if you're growing for another consumer who is a medical patient.
[13:39.620 --> 13:43.740]  I don't know if you're growing as a provider, a free market provider.
[13:43.740 --> 13:48.460]  I don't know your goal but if you do, you can find the plant that works best for you.
[13:48.460 --> 13:49.540]  Are you growing soil?
[13:49.540 --> 13:50.540]  Are you growing hydro?
[13:50.540 --> 13:51.540]  Are you growing indoors?
[13:51.540 --> 13:52.540]  You're growing outdoors?
[13:52.540 --> 13:53.660]  Is it in a greenhouse?
[13:53.660 --> 13:55.860]  Is it going to be a screen of green?
[13:55.860 --> 13:57.020]  Is it going to be a sea of green?
[13:57.020 --> 14:00.860]  Is it going to be just one big plant in a seven gallon pot left to do whatever it wants
[14:00.860 --> 14:01.860]  to do?
[14:01.860 --> 14:05.900]  You will find different phenotypes within that pack of seeds that work the best for
[14:05.900 --> 14:06.900]  you.
[14:06.900 --> 14:12.860]  I like to explain it as sometimes you might say I want dinner and you decide I want Italian
[14:12.860 --> 14:15.580]  food and we all agree we're going to go get Italian food, right?
[14:15.580 --> 14:17.700]  So you go to the Italian restaurant.
[14:17.700 --> 14:20.340]  Once you get to that Italian restaurant, you've got a few more options.
[14:20.340 --> 14:22.020]  You got fettuccine.
[14:22.020 --> 14:23.580]  You got penne pasta.
[14:23.580 --> 14:25.260]  You got all kinds of other Italian food.
[14:25.260 --> 14:27.300]  I'm not even going to dig into it because I'm going to make myself hungry.
[14:27.300 --> 14:29.220]  I saw the Italian food come into the tables.
[14:29.220 --> 14:30.220]  I started doing that.
[14:30.220 --> 14:31.220]  Oh man.
[14:31.220 --> 14:33.420]  Anyway, you got all these different Italian options.
[14:33.420 --> 14:34.420]  You got red sauce.
[14:34.420 --> 14:35.420]  You got white sauce.
[14:35.420 --> 14:36.800]  You got no sauce.
[14:36.800 --> 14:39.240]  You got so many options when it comes to Italian food.
[14:39.240 --> 14:40.240]  Those are your phenotypes.
[14:40.240 --> 14:42.620]  So you got a pack of strawberry starburst.
[14:42.620 --> 14:43.840]  You're going to grow them.
[14:43.840 --> 14:45.780]  One is going to be a little bit strawberry.
[14:45.780 --> 14:47.900]  One is going to be a little bit gassy and footy.
[14:47.900 --> 14:50.020]  One's going to be strawberry gas and foot.
[14:50.700 --> 14:52.100]  And then one of them is probably not even going to get your attention.
[14:52.100 --> 14:54.980]  You're going to go, that plant right there, I'm just going to finish that and never grow
[14:54.980 --> 14:55.980]  that again.
[14:55.980 --> 14:58.540]  You can just tell there's one in the batch that is not for you.
[14:58.540 --> 15:00.700]  But there will be one that is for you.
[15:00.700 --> 15:06.460]  A lot of times, I find out of a 10 pack, I usually find two that I can't decide which
[15:06.460 --> 15:07.540]  are my favorites.
[15:07.540 --> 15:10.420]  One is usually the pain in the ass.
[15:10.420 --> 15:11.780]  It takes a little bit longer.
[15:11.780 --> 15:12.780]  It gets taller.
[15:12.780 --> 15:16.100]  It's got some, like, it's just frustrating, but it gets you so high and smells good that
[15:16.100 --> 15:17.740]  you cannot get rid of it.
[15:17.740 --> 15:22.860]  And then there's another one that is almost as good but not as good, but grows easier.
[15:22.860 --> 15:27.700]  So you're like, ah, the struggle of the grow and the extra 10 or 12 days versus that free
[15:27.700 --> 15:29.540]  10 or 12 days and it's almost as good.
[15:29.540 --> 15:32.700]  Do I even notice 10 or 12 days on the struggle worth?
[15:32.700 --> 15:34.620]  Like that's what I find in phenotypes.
[15:34.620 --> 15:38.660]  A lot of times I will share the easier phenotype with all of my friends so that they've got
[15:38.660 --> 15:42.820]  that cut for me if I want it and then I keep the harder one for myself because I know I
[15:42.820 --> 15:44.980]  can handle that harder, more challenging grow.
[15:45.020 --> 15:48.540]  So phenotypes, you're going to find different stuff in there.
[15:48.540 --> 15:56.940]  I have kind of, for a while I was really giving phenotype advice on my crosses and my strains,
[15:56.940 --> 16:01.300]  but I have kind of slowed down and dialed back and pulled back from doing that because
[16:01.300 --> 16:06.260]  I feel like I could be causing you, I'm not doing you a service.
[16:06.260 --> 16:08.900]  I'm causing you a detriment by doing that for you.
[16:08.900 --> 16:11.180]  I don't want to select the phenotype for you.
[16:11.180 --> 16:12.900]  You should select the phenotype yourself.
[16:12.900 --> 16:15.140]  I've narrowed it down pretty far.
[16:15.140 --> 16:21.260]  I bred these plants with a solid male that I know is going to put out good structure,
[16:21.260 --> 16:26.180]  good potency, good resistance to problems, and he's going to grow with vigor and he's
[16:26.180 --> 16:27.180]  going to work well.
[16:27.180 --> 16:28.180]  He's going to clone well.
[16:28.180 --> 16:30.500]  Then I use females that I know are tested.
[16:30.500 --> 16:31.500]  They grow well.
[16:31.500 --> 16:34.460]  They put out good structure, potency, flavors, aromas.
[16:34.460 --> 16:38.660]  So I've done the work to know that what I'm breeding is going to offer you a pretty good
[16:38.660 --> 16:40.700]  category of phenotypes to work with.
[16:40.700 --> 16:46.100]  Then it's just up to you to select out of that batch to find the phenotype that is for
[16:46.100 --> 16:47.100]  you.
[16:47.100 --> 16:49.260]  I said earlier, we're going to go to Italian food.
[16:49.260 --> 16:51.700]  All right, we all agreed on Italian food.
[16:51.700 --> 16:58.340]  When we get to the Italian restaurant, I like real heavy, rich, garlicky, white sauce kind
[16:58.340 --> 16:59.340]  of stuff.
[16:59.340 --> 17:00.340]  That's what we're going for today.
[17:00.340 --> 17:02.900]  Maybe some capers in there, something like that.
[17:02.900 --> 17:08.740]  You may want red sauce with sweetness to it, maybe a sweet red sauce.
[17:08.740 --> 17:11.300]  I'm just making shit up right now off the top of my head.
[17:11.300 --> 17:14.020]  But we can get both of those at the Italian restaurant.
[17:14.020 --> 17:18.640]  So if you buy a pack of Italian restaurant seeds, there's going to be that red sauce
[17:18.640 --> 17:20.940]  and that white sauce phenotype.
[17:20.940 --> 17:23.360]  Don't let me pick the phenotype for you.
[17:23.360 --> 17:25.500]  Pick the one that works best for you.
[17:25.500 --> 17:30.500]  I'm going to pick the 77-day phenotype that gets kind of tall and it's hard to grow, but
[17:30.500 --> 17:34.260]  it gets covered in trichomes and it's just super potent.
[17:34.260 --> 17:36.740]  I'm going to take a drink so you don't hear my throat do that.
[17:36.740 --> 17:38.420]  But that's what I'm going to pick.
[17:38.420 --> 17:39.420]  You might not pick that.
[17:39.420 --> 17:42.500]  You might not have been growing for half of your life and you may not be ready to deal
[17:42.500 --> 17:46.100]  with the plant that takes 77 or 87 days to finish.
[17:46.100 --> 17:47.100]  You might not want that.
[17:47.100 --> 17:51.140]  They may, just that description, you may say, get rid of that plant now.
[17:51.140 --> 17:55.540]  So it's all about you choosing the phenotype that works best for you or your patients or
[17:55.540 --> 17:59.540]  your clients or whatever your goal is.
[17:59.580 --> 18:05.060]  So I may talk about which phenotypes are available from my crosses and I may kind of highlight
[18:05.060 --> 18:07.300]  things that I've seen and what's common.
[18:07.300 --> 18:11.820]  And like usually there are three to five, maybe seven really common phenotypes in an
[18:11.820 --> 18:14.700]  F1 and I observe them because I grow a lot of the seeds.
[18:14.700 --> 18:16.100]  I'll tell you what I see.
[18:16.100 --> 18:17.180]  Sometimes I name some of them.
[18:17.180 --> 18:21.640]  There's like the mean girl phenotype and the chunky girl phenotype of stuff.
[18:21.640 --> 18:23.860]  Sometimes we just call it the arise leaning phenotype.
[18:23.860 --> 18:28.560]  If you've got a blueberry cookies or a blueberry butcher plant, now I just really talked myself
[18:28.580 --> 18:29.580]  into a circle.
[18:29.580 --> 18:33.120]  If you've got a blueberry butcher plant, sometimes I'll say that one is Jack the Ripper leaning.
[18:33.120 --> 18:34.120]  That's the Jack phenotype.
[18:34.120 --> 18:38.600]  It just looks more like Jack the Ripper or maybe it looks more like blueberry cookies.
[18:38.600 --> 18:40.800]  We'll just call it the one name phenotype.
[18:40.800 --> 18:43.640]  There's a, I've got a plant I call the sour balls pheno.
[18:43.640 --> 18:46.060]  It smells like your balls need a bath.
[18:46.060 --> 18:48.720]  I've got a phenotype that I call the arise pheno.
[18:48.720 --> 18:53.320]  There are phenotypes that I name after the people who give me the cut.
[18:53.320 --> 18:59.800]  I maybe allegedly got a cut of my afterglow back from a friend and it is named after her.
[18:59.800 --> 19:04.480]  So in the future you will see the afterglow painted lady cut.
[19:04.480 --> 19:08.920]  It will be made famous because she did a really good job finding that phenotype for me.
[19:08.920 --> 19:13.560]  The painted lady afterglow or the afterglow cut found by painted lady.
[19:13.560 --> 19:20.080]  So the painted lady phenotype is a, just a, it's a seed of the afterglow that came from
[19:20.080 --> 19:25.200]  a bag of afterglow seeds and she grew it and found a beautiful, beautiful phenotype
[19:25.200 --> 19:29.840]  and she kept it and I acquired a clone of that somehow and I've got it and I, it's still
[19:29.840 --> 19:34.360]  called afterglow, but since it's that special phenotype that painted lady found, it is the
[19:34.360 --> 19:36.560]  afterglow painted lady phenotype.
[19:36.560 --> 19:37.840]  She put, I put her name on it.
[19:37.840 --> 19:39.480]  She will be known for finding that.
[19:39.480 --> 19:42.600]  She's always going to get some love from me for searching that out of a pack.
[19:42.600 --> 19:45.920]  You guys follow the painted lady on cannabis, painted lady 13 or the painted lady.
[19:45.920 --> 19:46.920]  You'll find her.
[19:46.920 --> 19:47.920]  She's a great girl.
[19:47.920 --> 19:48.920]  A great person.
[19:48.920 --> 19:49.920]  She's a big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big
[19:49.920 --> 19:53.880]  ass out there in Michigan, killing it a big shout out, but she will always be known for
[19:53.880 --> 19:57.360]  that a painted lady cut and that painted lady coat will always have her name on it.
[19:57.360 --> 20:00.920]  When I breed to it, people say, well, which, which afterglow did you use?
[20:00.920 --> 20:02.320]  And I'll say that painted lady bro.
[20:02.320 --> 20:03.520]  And that'll be the one.
[20:03.520 --> 20:07.920]  So there is the painted lady phenotype of afterglow.
[20:07.920 --> 20:13.000]  Um, but I feel like when I was telling you guys which phenotypes to select from my plants,
[20:13.000 --> 20:16.620]  I was kind of messing you up because then everybody was just picking the same phenotypes
[20:16.620 --> 20:18.240]  and why do you want what I like?
[20:18.560 --> 20:21.760]  I gave you like, I gave you a CD with 10 tracks on there.
[20:21.760 --> 20:23.480]  You don't have to pick the same track that I like.
[20:23.480 --> 20:28.200]  You could pick a different track and play it and jam it and love it just as much.
[20:28.200 --> 20:30.000]  So, uh, what is a phenotype?
[20:30.000 --> 20:35.600]  A phenotype when we grow multiple seeds, we're going to see a variation in those seeds.
[20:35.600 --> 20:37.280]  You're going to find boys, pull the boys.
[20:37.280 --> 20:39.880]  Now you're going to have females to select from.
[20:39.880 --> 20:42.160]  They're going to show you different traits.
[20:42.160 --> 20:46.060]  Some will be shorter, some will be taller, some will be stinkier, some will taste better.
[20:46.060 --> 20:47.680]  Some will get a better buzz.
[20:47.680 --> 20:49.440]  Some will taste long, take longer to finish.
[20:49.440 --> 20:51.240]  Some will finish more quickly.
[20:51.240 --> 20:52.240]  Some will be problematic.
[20:52.240 --> 20:54.560]  Some will just give you some bullshit problems to deal with.
[20:54.560 --> 20:59.080]  Those are all different phenotypes and it's up to you to find the phenotype that you really
[20:59.080 --> 21:00.080]  enjoy.
[21:00.080 --> 21:03.520]  Once a breeder has been making seeds for a long time and we've narrowed down our breeding
[21:03.520 --> 21:08.520]  process to our things come out, um, more uniform stable is not the word I want to use because
[21:08.520 --> 21:10.680]  they're not stable at this point when we're making F1s.
[21:10.680 --> 21:11.680]  They are brand new.
[21:11.680 --> 21:13.200]  Uh, they're all over the place.
[21:13.200 --> 21:14.280]  There's a lot of variation.
[21:14.280 --> 21:16.840]  That's why we're seeing phenotypical expression.
[21:16.840 --> 21:19.400]  Um, you're going to see this difference.
[21:19.400 --> 21:21.600]  You're going to see, I just talked to myself in a circle, don't even remember what the
[21:21.600 --> 21:22.600]  fuck I was saying.
[21:22.600 --> 21:26.840]  Uh, when you make seeds, you're going to see this variation, this phenotypical variation.
[21:26.840 --> 21:29.480]  You get to pick the variation that works best for you.
[21:29.480 --> 21:31.400]  Do you want the tall one, the short one?
[21:31.400 --> 21:32.400]  That's what you get to pick.
[21:32.400 --> 21:33.840]  That is called the phenohyme.
[21:33.840 --> 21:37.800]  Run a package of seeds, find the one that works best for you, your garden, your customers,
[21:37.800 --> 21:39.640]  your clientele, your future.
[21:39.640 --> 21:40.640]  Select that one.
[21:40.640 --> 21:41.640]  You can name it if you want.
[21:41.640 --> 21:47.440]  This is a Arise, the let's pick a grower, the Arise Tenasi Gardens Cut.
[21:47.440 --> 21:48.440]  He may have that.
[21:48.440 --> 21:49.440]  I don't know.
[21:49.440 --> 21:50.440]  It's possible.
[21:50.440 --> 21:53.720]  So Tenasi may have found a beautiful cut of Arise and he named it the Tenasi Cut.
[21:53.720 --> 21:56.360]  And if he wants to share it out, he could just say that's Arise.
[21:56.360 --> 21:57.560]  I call it the Tenasi Cut.
[21:57.560 --> 22:00.320]  And then people will know that's the one that came from Tenasi forever.
[22:00.320 --> 22:01.320]  Shout out to my boy Tenasi.
[22:01.320 --> 22:02.920]  I just made that up, put you in the game.
[22:02.920 --> 22:05.520]  Um, where do we go from there?
[22:05.520 --> 22:07.160]  How do I find a pheno?
[22:07.160 --> 22:13.440]  I think I've done a full podcast on pheno hunts and phenotype selection, but grow them.
[22:13.440 --> 22:15.600]  Find the one that you're in love with the most.
[22:15.600 --> 22:16.640]  You'll know early.
[22:16.640 --> 22:19.120]  A lot of us will find out very early into flower.
[22:19.120 --> 22:21.320]  You go like week three, you're like, that's the one right there.
[22:21.320 --> 22:23.040]  And then you're already in love with it.
[22:23.040 --> 22:26.640]  It's going to be your favorite all the way through growing, drying, curing, and smoking.
[22:26.640 --> 22:28.800]  And you're going to say number three is the champion.
[22:28.800 --> 22:33.800]  A lot of times I will narrow it down to two or three out of a 10 or 25 pack of testers.
[22:33.800 --> 22:38.520]  I'll find my favorite two or three, and then I'll run those two or three side by side again.
[22:38.520 --> 22:41.720]  And then we'll do smoke tests and we'll do extraction tests.
[22:41.720 --> 22:46.640]  See which smokes better, which extracts better, which washes better, which takes better pictures.
[22:46.640 --> 22:50.380]  We'll just kind of narrow it down, blindly smoke it with all the homies around and see
[22:50.380 --> 22:52.080]  who likes which one better.
[22:52.080 --> 22:53.520]  But that is how we do a pheno hunt.
[22:53.520 --> 22:56.400]  Just grow it, smoke it, and see what works best.
[22:56.400 --> 23:03.440]  Are you, one thing that is always noticeable, the growers and the consumers often argue
[23:03.560 --> 23:04.840]  over which is better.
[23:04.840 --> 23:09.080]  Because the grower doesn't, the grower has to deal with the grow.
[23:09.080 --> 23:13.160]  The consumer doesn't have to think about this plant was fucking nitrogen deficient the whole
[23:13.160 --> 23:18.480]  time and it gave me a headache for nine weeks and I was chasing it and fighting it the entire time.
[23:18.480 --> 23:23.400]  The smoker doesn't think about this one needs extra water because it's super thirsty.
[23:23.400 --> 23:26.400]  Or it doesn't think about, man I had to watch that one every day because it doesn't drink
[23:26.400 --> 23:29.500]  much and if I over watered it ever it would give me problems.
[23:29.500 --> 23:31.060]  The smokers don't think about that.
[23:31.060 --> 23:34.900]  So the growers and the smokers are often choosing different phenotypes.
[23:34.900 --> 23:37.060]  The grower wants the one that's going to grow easier.
[23:37.060 --> 23:38.100]  I don't mind a challenge.
[23:38.100 --> 23:39.100]  I like that at this point.
[23:39.100 --> 23:40.100]  It makes it more fun for me.
[23:40.100 --> 23:41.340]  It keeps me on my toes.
[23:41.340 --> 23:45.920]  But you'll find out that often times the one that grows the best and smokes the best are
[23:45.920 --> 23:46.920]  not the same phenotypes.
[23:46.920 --> 23:49.180]  You're going to have to make some decisions there.
[23:49.180 --> 23:50.180]  I do have some more notes.
[23:50.180 --> 23:51.180]  I want to make sure I cover them all.
[23:51.180 --> 23:52.180]  I got rambly.
[23:52.180 --> 23:54.180]  I love it when it works like that.
[23:54.180 --> 23:55.180]  Nice and flowy.
[23:55.180 --> 23:58.740]  I was going to say you chose that seed pack for a reason.
[23:58.740 --> 24:01.220]  It's got what you're seeking should be in there.
[24:01.220 --> 24:05.100]  So you just have to find the one that works the best for you.
[24:05.100 --> 24:09.020]  Then somebody asked me if I prefer a large pheno hunt or a small pheno hunt.
[24:09.020 --> 24:11.180]  And I've got a very good answer for that.
[24:11.180 --> 24:17.700]  In a commercial environment I would do somewhere between 25 to 100 seeds because as the breeder
[24:17.700 --> 24:20.700]  I want to see what that seed line has got to offer.
[24:20.700 --> 24:23.460]  I'm going to find those 3 to 7 basic phenotypes.
[24:23.460 --> 24:26.660]  I've been talking about 3, 5, maybe 7 basic phenotypes.
[24:26.660 --> 24:31.580]  But if I grow 100, maybe 200 seeds I'm going to find things that most people will never
[24:31.580 --> 24:32.580]  see.
[24:32.580 --> 24:33.580]  It's all about numbers.
[24:33.580 --> 24:37.780]  The more population I grow the more oddities, the more outliers I've got the opportunity
[24:37.780 --> 24:38.780]  to find.
[24:38.780 --> 24:43.220]  So that's when I see weird shit is when I grow 100 or 200 at a time and just let them
[24:43.220 --> 24:44.220]  grow.
[24:44.220 --> 24:45.780]  Don't pull anything too early.
[24:45.780 --> 24:48.260]  Just see what they all look like and what they all do.
[24:48.260 --> 24:50.700]  That is a commercial grower approach.
[24:50.700 --> 24:52.260]  That is a breeder's approach.
[24:52.260 --> 24:58.220]  In a home grow environment I feel like, and this is just my opinion, I feel like I have
[24:58.220 --> 25:03.700]  done the work on the seeds that you should find a keeper in a 10 pack of seeds.
[25:03.700 --> 25:08.020]  If you're not in a 5 pack, I sell 5 packs, you will find a keeper in a 5 pack of seeds
[25:08.020 --> 25:10.500]  and if you don't let me know we'll make you happy.
[25:10.500 --> 25:13.460]  I have done the work by having reliable male plants.
[25:13.460 --> 25:16.180]  I have done the work by having reliable female plants.
[25:16.180 --> 25:17.740]  I've tested all of these plants.
[25:17.740 --> 25:22.300]  I know that my breeding works and I know that within a 5 pack you will find at least
[25:22.300 --> 25:26.100]  one keeper and a 10 pack you should find one amazing keeper.
[25:26.100 --> 25:30.460]  I have done the work with the selection of my breeding stock to make that part easy for
[25:30.460 --> 25:31.460]  you.
[25:31.460 --> 25:35.180]  If you're not finding a keeper in a 10 pack of seeds you might want to reconsider who
[25:35.180 --> 25:36.900]  you're buying your seeds from.
[25:36.900 --> 25:38.740]  I'm not saying that they're a bad breeder.
[25:38.740 --> 25:42.140]  I'm not saying they're not doing good work, but if you're not finding what you want in
[25:42.140 --> 25:45.860]  a 10 pack, are they being advertised and described properly?
[25:45.860 --> 25:49.540]  As it's said, oranges and chocolate grows in 70 days.
[25:49.540 --> 25:52.300]  You bought it thinking oranges and chocolate 70 days.
[25:52.300 --> 25:56.220]  Obviously, if it's not doing what you expected it to do and not making you happy, you may
[25:56.220 --> 25:58.500]  need to find another seed breeder.
[25:58.500 --> 26:00.500]  Somebody whose descriptions match their outcomes.
[26:00.500 --> 26:04.180]  I really try to do my best when it comes to descriptions and outcomes.
[26:04.180 --> 26:06.460]  I take a lot of feedback from people.
[26:06.460 --> 26:07.860]  I do a lot of my own research.
[26:07.860 --> 26:09.380]  I do a lot of observation.
[26:09.380 --> 26:14.120]  I do a lot of editing and updating because I want you people to get accurate information
[26:14.120 --> 26:16.720]  and accurate advice on a seed package.
[26:16.720 --> 26:17.720]  All right.
[26:17.720 --> 26:19.760]  I feel like I got really off topic and really rambly today.
[26:19.760 --> 26:20.960]  This was a fun podcast.
[26:20.960 --> 26:23.800]  It is too hot in here to even focus any longer.
[26:23.800 --> 26:25.160]  I am sweating through my shirt.
[26:25.160 --> 26:26.880]  I hope you don't see it.
[26:26.880 --> 26:28.320]  This has been a great fun podcast.
[26:28.320 --> 26:30.200]  I like talking about phenotypes.
[26:30.200 --> 26:33.400]  I also feel like I could get super rambly and off topic on this one.
[26:33.400 --> 26:35.400]  So I'm going to check my notes here.
[26:35.400 --> 26:36.400]  Check my notes here.
[26:36.400 --> 26:38.000]  I feel like I have covered everything.
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.620]  I want to thank you for this great question about phenotypes.
[26:40.620 --> 26:45.420]  If you have got any more questions about phenotypes, I've done a full episode on phenotypical
[26:45.420 --> 26:46.420]  selection.
[26:46.420 --> 26:48.620]  Also, feel free to send me an email.

[26:57.740 --> 26:58.740]  Let me know what you think.
[26:58.740 --> 26:59.740]  Let me know what I missed.
[26:59.740 --> 27:00.740]  Tell me how you feel about the show.
[27:00.740 --> 27:02.420]  I think that is all I've got for you.
[27:02.420 --> 27:03.780]  My brain is seriously cooking.
[27:03.780 --> 27:04.780]  I am seriously sweating.
[27:04.780 --> 27:08.940]  It is time to take off some shoes and get some water in my body, turn the air conditioner
[27:08.940 --> 27:09.940]  back up.
[27:09.940 --> 27:10.940]  Thank you again for listening.

[27:24.180 --> 27:25.860]  I'm going to get out of here before my brain melts.
[27:25.860 --> 27:28.700]  I want to give a big shout-out to my buddy Raptor Grows.
[27:28.700 --> 27:31.980]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
