[00:17.340 --> 00:20.020]  Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis community.
[00:20.020 --> 00:21.740]  It's time for episode number 149
[00:21.740 --> 00:23.540]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:23.540 --> 00:27.100]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.100 --> 00:28.100]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:28.100 --> 00:29.160]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.160 --> 00:31.540]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:31.540 --> 00:32.780]  if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:32.780 --> 00:33.940]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:33.940 --> 00:35.740]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:35.740 --> 00:38.140]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:39.120 --> 00:40.820]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:40.820 --> 00:42.620]  I wanna thank you once again for joining me.
[00:42.620 --> 00:44.780]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:44.780 --> 00:46.500]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots Band
[00:46.500 --> 00:48.860]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:48.860 --> 00:50.500]  Big thanks to Kat, Koot,
[00:50.500 --> 00:52.540]  and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:53.380 --> 00:55.180]  Yeah, I hope everybody's having a great week.
[00:55.180 --> 00:56.420]  I hope you're smoking a fat joint.
[00:56.420 --> 00:57.740]  I hope you got the email turned on.
[00:57.740 --> 00:59.180]  I hope you're taking a dab.
[00:59.180 --> 01:00.420]  Hope you're smoking some good shatter,
[01:00.420 --> 01:01.540]  maybe some good live resin.
[01:01.540 --> 01:02.940]  Maybe you're smoking some rosin with me.
[01:02.940 --> 01:05.100]  Whatever you're smoking, I hope you're getting high as shit
[01:05.100 --> 01:06.540]  and having a good time with us.
[01:06.540 --> 01:07.820]  Ladies and gentlemen, this episode
[01:07.820 --> 01:09.580]  features our good friends White Mike
[01:09.580 --> 01:11.160]  and also Jesse Groza's back.
[01:11.160 --> 01:13.060]  We talk about a little bit of outdoor growing.
[01:13.060 --> 01:15.040]  We talk about a whole bunch of randomness.
[01:15.040 --> 01:17.660]  This is a really wonderful episode in my opinion.
[01:18.840 --> 01:21.080]  You guys, I did drop a Thursday episode.
[01:21.080 --> 01:23.000]  If you didn't catch the episode that came out on Thursday,
[01:23.000 --> 01:24.400]  make sure you go back and check that one out.
[01:24.400 --> 01:25.680]  Number 148 is available.
[01:25.680 --> 01:27.080]  It came out Thursday.
[01:27.080 --> 01:28.800]  I usually post every episode on Monday.
[01:28.800 --> 01:30.620]  I have had a bunch of content,
[01:30.620 --> 01:32.800]  so I felt like I could put one out on Thursday for you.
[01:32.800 --> 01:33.640]  I hope you listened.
[01:33.640 --> 01:34.760]  I hope you enjoyed it.
[01:34.760 --> 01:35.600]  Send me a tweet.

[01:36.900 --> 01:37.740]  Find me on Twitter.
[01:37.740 --> 01:39.400]  It's at GFYH Podcast.
[01:39.400 --> 01:41.280]  I would love to hear from you.
[01:41.280 --> 01:42.640]  You guys, I'm gonna let the music play,
[01:42.640 --> 01:43.800]  and when we get back,
[01:43.840 --> 01:46.160]  Mike and Jesse will be joining us at the table.
[01:46.160 --> 01:47.600]  Enjoy the music for a moment.
[01:51.140 --> 01:51.980]  Do it, Mike.
[01:51.980 --> 01:52.800]  You wanna bust a freestyle?
[01:52.800 --> 01:53.640]  No.
[01:53.640 --> 01:54.480]  It looks like you're about to let one go.
[01:54.480 --> 01:55.300]  No.
[01:55.300 --> 01:56.140]  I wanna hear a freestyle rap.
[01:56.140 --> 01:57.740]  I wanna hear the white Mike freestyle rap.
[01:57.740 --> 01:59.100]  There's not a white Mike freestyle.
[01:59.100 --> 01:59.940]  It's not gonna happen.
[01:59.940 --> 02:00.780]  Trap rap.
[02:00.780 --> 02:01.600]  No.
[02:01.600 --> 02:02.700]  Talking about city council.
[02:02.700 --> 02:03.540]  City council.
[02:03.540 --> 02:04.380]  Oh!
[02:04.380 --> 02:05.620]  Talking about city council.
[02:05.620 --> 02:06.460]  No, man.
[02:06.460 --> 02:07.280]  City council.
[02:07.280 --> 02:09.300]  Make sure you register to vote, city council.
[02:09.300 --> 02:10.420]  Slang it to Texans.
[02:10.420 --> 02:11.260]  Yes, we will.
[02:11.260 --> 02:13.940]  I have press record, you guys.
[02:13.940 --> 02:15.180]  So we are recording at this podcast.
[02:15.220 --> 02:17.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to episode number 149.
[02:17.700 --> 02:19.620]  As promised, sitting to the left of me
[02:19.620 --> 02:21.960]  is a repeat offender, a returning champion.
[02:21.960 --> 02:23.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the podcast,
[02:23.440 --> 02:24.580]  our good buddy Jesse Gross.
[02:24.580 --> 02:25.420]  Welcome back, bro.
[02:25.420 --> 02:26.460]  Hey, what's up?
[02:26.460 --> 02:31.140]  You guys, Jesse showed up with Raw Terps today.
[02:31.140 --> 02:32.220]  He's got some distillate.
[02:32.220 --> 02:33.860]  He's got some shatter.
[02:33.860 --> 02:36.060]  He's locked and loaded and ready to go.
[02:36.060 --> 02:37.660]  Bro, thanks for showing up ready.
[02:37.660 --> 02:38.980]  For sure, yeah.
[02:38.980 --> 02:40.180]  Yeah, you gotta use your microphone voice.
[02:40.180 --> 02:41.340]  Sorry, I interrupted him.
[02:41.340 --> 02:42.380]  He was about to take a drink of that
[02:42.380 --> 02:44.620]  frosty cold blue beer, and I started talking to him.
[02:45.020 --> 02:45.860]  The cotton mouth killer.
[02:45.860 --> 02:47.660]  Yeah, oh man, speaking of cotton mouth,
[02:47.660 --> 02:49.800]  we are taking some serious dabs here today.
[02:49.800 --> 02:51.260]  Jesse, before we get too far,
[02:51.260 --> 02:53.860]  tell everybody on social media how they can stalk you
[02:53.860 --> 02:55.760]  while they listen to your sexy voice.
[02:56.740 --> 02:58.420]  Instagram, jessegross.
[02:59.340 --> 03:02.340]  And then also you can check out my podcast.
[03:02.340 --> 03:04.340]  We've got a Facebook page,
[03:04.340 --> 03:06.420]  Colorado Dope Podcast on Facebook.
[03:06.420 --> 03:07.900]  The Colorado Dope Podcast, you guys.

[03:09.220 --> 03:10.060]  It's a great show.
[03:10.060 --> 03:10.880]  I've been on that show.
[03:10.880 --> 03:11.860]  Big shout out to Mick the Dog.
[03:11.860 --> 03:13.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, Mick the Dog will be joining us
[03:13.540 --> 03:14.740]  also on this podcast right now.
[03:14.740 --> 03:17.020]  He's taking a comfy seat underneath the table.
[03:17.020 --> 03:18.220]  If you're a regular listener,
[03:18.220 --> 03:19.580]  you know the other day I kicked the dog.
[03:19.580 --> 03:22.380]  I apologize, I did not mean to do that.
[03:22.380 --> 03:23.420]  Jesse, thanks for joining us.
[03:23.420 --> 03:26.180]  Everybody, make sure you follow at jessegross on Instagram.
[03:26.180 --> 03:27.220]  Take a look at his photography
[03:27.220 --> 03:28.160]  while you're listening to the show.
[03:28.160 --> 03:29.740]  Check him out, see what he does.
[03:29.740 --> 03:31.880]  We're gonna talk a whole lot about outdoor growing.
[03:31.880 --> 03:33.600]  You guys, also across the table from me,
[03:33.600 --> 03:35.860]  another repeat offender, a returning champion,
[03:35.860 --> 03:37.100]  the guy that was here just last night
[03:37.100 --> 03:37.980]  recording a show with me.
[03:37.980 --> 03:38.820]  I missed you, bro.
[03:38.820 --> 03:39.660]  Welcome back, Mike.
[03:39.660 --> 03:40.500]  What's up, everybody?
[03:40.500 --> 03:41.620]  White Mike is on the podcast.
[03:41.620 --> 03:43.660]  If you're not a regular listener,
[03:43.660 --> 03:44.500]  you can check Mike out.
[03:44.500 --> 03:46.820]  He's at Nemopunk15 on Twitter,
[03:46.820 --> 03:51.620]  and he is also Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws on Facebook.
[03:51.620 --> 03:52.900]  Make sure you check out that group page.
[03:52.900 --> 03:53.740]  Did I get that right?
[03:53.740 --> 03:54.560]  Perfectly.
[03:54.560 --> 03:55.400]  I've been trying to train that in my brain.
[03:55.400 --> 03:57.500]  That's a lot of words for my stoner brain.
[03:58.540 --> 04:00.220]  Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws on Facebook.
[04:00.220 --> 04:01.700]  You've got enough of your own social media in your head
[04:01.700 --> 04:04.540]  remembering someone else's is, thanks, man.
[04:04.540 --> 04:05.380]  For sure, man.
[04:05.380 --> 04:06.200]  Thanks for doing that for us.
[04:06.200 --> 04:07.040]  I told you on the last episode,
[04:07.040 --> 04:09.620]  we need you out there fighting that part of the fight.
[04:09.620 --> 04:11.300]  I'll do the breeding, Jesse will do the growing.
[04:11.980 --> 04:13.020]  You get us legal fight for us.
[04:13.020 --> 04:13.860]  Welcome back to the show, bro.
[04:13.860 --> 04:15.300]  I appreciate having you here.
[04:15.300 --> 04:17.660]  Taking time away from the baby, the family, the dogs.
[04:17.660 --> 04:18.500]  You're a busy dude.
[04:18.500 --> 04:19.660]  It's great to have you here.
[04:19.660 --> 04:20.860]  You were supposed to trim all night,
[04:20.860 --> 04:22.380]  so I'm glad that you ended up not trimming.
[04:22.380 --> 04:23.460]  I was, I ended up trimming all night,
[04:23.460 --> 04:26.340]  and then that got waved off, so yeah.
[04:26.340 --> 04:27.980]  Back for the podcast, I love it.
[04:27.980 --> 04:28.820]  Shut up.
[04:28.820 --> 04:30.780]  I was hoping to be here with Jesse finally.
[04:30.780 --> 04:32.380]  This is a first.
[04:32.380 --> 04:33.220]  No, it's not.
[04:33.220 --> 04:34.040]  It's not.
[04:34.040 --> 04:34.880]  I was gonna say.
[04:34.880 --> 04:35.720]  Though, we've done celebratories, haven't we?
[04:35.720 --> 04:36.700]  Yeah, like 50 and 100.
[04:36.700 --> 04:38.300]  I think you're both here for those.
[04:38.300 --> 04:40.700]  Yeah, I think we did one before, too.
[04:40.740 --> 04:43.580]  I met you at this table doing a podcast.
[04:43.580 --> 04:44.580]  That's how many I've done.
[04:44.580 --> 04:46.460]  I dabbed that memory away completely.
[04:46.460 --> 04:49.380]  It's hard to remember some of those early, early episodes.
[04:49.380 --> 04:50.580]  Right, they're foggy in my head.
[04:50.580 --> 04:52.180]  People remind me of things I've said
[04:52.180 --> 04:53.300]  and done on those episodes,
[04:53.300 --> 04:54.820]  and I'm like, wow, that happened.
[04:54.820 --> 04:55.660]  Yeah.
[04:55.660 --> 04:56.480]  Way to burst the balloon.
[04:56.480 --> 04:57.700]  I've been toting around all day, bud.
[04:57.700 --> 04:58.540]  Sorry.
[04:58.540 --> 05:01.300]  Well, hey, this is the first meaningful one.
[05:01.300 --> 05:02.120]  How about that?
[05:02.120 --> 05:04.300]  Right, the first grow-oriented one.
[05:04.300 --> 05:06.860]  This is episode 149, you guys.
[05:06.860 --> 05:09.460]  149 episodes into this podcast.
[05:09.460 --> 05:11.340]  I haven't missed a week in two and a half years.
[05:11.340 --> 05:13.700]  Every Monday, you guys have had a podcast to listen to,
[05:13.700 --> 05:15.340]  and some Thursdays.
[05:15.340 --> 05:17.060]  It's been incredible.
[05:17.060 --> 05:20.020]  I've been running 20 episodes.
[05:20.020 --> 05:20.860]  Nice.
[05:20.860 --> 05:21.680]  Or tomorrow, actually.
[05:21.680 --> 05:22.520]  Tomorrow will be your 20th?
[05:22.520 --> 05:23.360]  Yeah.
[05:23.360 --> 05:24.780]  I was honored to be on one of those episodes.
[05:24.780 --> 05:26.580]  You guys, we did a, I call it a swap cast.
[05:26.580 --> 05:29.340]  I learned the phrase swap cast from Doug Stanhope,
[05:29.340 --> 05:31.300]  but it's when two podcasters come together
[05:31.300 --> 05:32.920]  and record one podcast,
[05:32.920 --> 05:34.340]  and then they both put it up on their feed
[05:34.340 --> 05:35.540]  so that everybody gets exposed
[05:35.540 --> 05:37.380]  to both shows at the same time.
[05:37.380 --> 05:39.280]  I did one of those with the Colorado podcast.
[05:40.100 --> 05:41.060]  It was good fun.
[05:41.060 --> 05:42.980]  It's a little bit of chaos, but it is a great show.
[05:42.980 --> 05:45.320]  Listen to it on their feed so that they get the clicks,
[05:45.320 --> 05:46.160]  you guys.
[05:46.160 --> 05:48.000]  Go to the Colorado podcast page
[05:48.000 --> 05:49.720]  and listen to that episode on their feed
[05:49.720 --> 05:51.200]  because they could use the traffic.
[05:51.200 --> 05:53.120]  We've actually got to boost them up.
[05:53.120 --> 05:54.720]  We've got some internet problems
[05:54.720 --> 05:56.520]  or some website problems at the moment,
[05:56.520 --> 05:58.480]  so I'm not sure they'll be able to find that one.
[05:58.480 --> 05:59.960]  Uh-oh, tech difficulties, mate.
[05:59.960 --> 06:01.600]  Well, this episode won't come out for a few days,
[06:01.600 --> 06:03.280]  so hopefully you've got that resolved by then, bro.
[06:03.280 --> 06:04.560]  Hopefully your tech guy is on it.
[06:04.560 --> 06:07.280]  If not, I know a guy that'll work on that one for you.
[06:07.280 --> 06:08.120]  All right.
[06:08.520 --> 06:10.960]  I was gonna say I'm excited because episode 150,
[06:10.960 --> 06:12.480]  it has been confirmed.
[06:12.480 --> 06:15.320]  Episode 150 is going to feature the Dab and Granny
[06:15.320 --> 06:16.160]  once again.
[06:16.160 --> 06:17.340]  I know I recorded the episode before.
[06:17.340 --> 06:18.680]  I'm still heartbroken that it failed.
[06:18.680 --> 06:21.840]  Everyone has been real supportive and encouraging.
[06:21.840 --> 06:23.240]  Everyone's all about coming back
[06:23.240 --> 06:25.140]  and re-recording that podcast.
[06:25.140 --> 06:27.280]  Dab and Granny went and bought special hash
[06:27.280 --> 06:28.680]  to smoke with me to show me
[06:28.680 --> 06:30.520]  that she doesn't mind doing it again.
[06:30.520 --> 06:31.360]  I love it.
[06:31.360 --> 06:32.920]  So tomorrow night at a secret location,
[06:32.920 --> 06:34.520]  I will be recording with the Dab and Granny.
[06:34.520 --> 06:35.700]  You guys, it'll be at the Cana Canyon.
[06:35.700 --> 06:36.540]  By the time this goes out,
[06:36.540 --> 06:38.660]  it'll be too late for anyone to show up and harass us.
[06:38.660 --> 06:40.140]  But tomorrow night at the Cana Canyon,
[06:40.140 --> 06:41.580]  it'll be myself, Dab and Granny,
[06:41.580 --> 06:42.820]  Brett from Evo Labs,
[06:42.820 --> 06:44.460]  and Lindsey the Traveling Stoner,
[06:44.460 --> 06:46.540]  and probably Bobo Blaster Co. will be there.
[06:46.540 --> 06:47.820]  Hopefully Miss Camille will be there.
[06:47.820 --> 06:49.100]  Hopefully Aaron will be there.
[06:49.100 --> 06:50.500]  Hopefully Biddy and Sirius will be there.
[06:50.500 --> 06:51.340]  We'll try to,
[06:51.340 --> 06:53.220]  I'm not even gonna try to mimic the show we did last time.
[06:53.220 --> 06:54.580]  That's bullshit to try to do.
[06:54.580 --> 06:55.940]  There'll be things that get left behind.
[06:55.940 --> 06:57.580]  We're just gonna have a conversation like we did.
[06:57.580 --> 06:59.540]  Some of that is lost forever
[06:59.540 --> 07:02.140]  unless you find it on Dab and Granny's social feed.
[07:02.140 --> 07:04.460]  And you know, it was Dab and Granny's first podcast
[07:04.460 --> 07:06.100]  and she wasn't sure how to go about it right away,
[07:06.660 --> 07:07.860]  so now she is completely fucking comfortable
[07:07.860 --> 07:09.220]  and she knows what to do on a podcast.
[07:09.220 --> 07:10.700]  So it was a practice run, you guys.
[07:10.700 --> 07:12.660]  But 150 will be the Dab and Granny.
[07:12.660 --> 07:14.820]  That's kind of a cool way for karma to land on us.
[07:14.820 --> 07:15.740]  That's not a bad deal.
[07:15.740 --> 07:16.580]  That's gonna be awesome.
[07:16.580 --> 07:17.400]  Yeah, all right.
[07:17.400 --> 07:18.820]  We're gonna talk about outdoor growing, you guys.
[07:18.820 --> 07:19.860]  I wanna talk about these Dabs,
[07:19.860 --> 07:21.300]  this Distillate, and these Terps, though, bro.
[07:21.300 --> 07:23.900]  You showed up with some delicious shit, Jesse.
[07:23.900 --> 07:27.800]  Remind me what's in each of these little vials you got here.
[07:27.800 --> 07:29.980]  We got Critical Mass.
[07:29.980 --> 07:31.820]  Critical Mass Terps.
[07:31.820 --> 07:32.900]  Distillate.
[07:32.900 --> 07:34.460]  Raw Distillate.
[07:34.460 --> 07:35.820]  This is the OVM.
[07:36.460 --> 07:37.860]  Orange...
[07:37.860 --> 07:38.900]  Vanilla Milano.
[07:38.900 --> 07:39.980]  Orange Vanilla Milano.
[07:39.980 --> 07:41.100]  Shout out to the Garden of Weden
[07:41.100 --> 07:42.500]  for an amazing breeding project.
[07:42.500 --> 07:44.320]  That was his first run Chuck and Pollen
[07:44.320 --> 07:47.140]  and those fucking, that strain came out amazing.
[07:47.140 --> 07:48.260]  Yeah, I could tell him.
[07:48.260 --> 07:49.440]  Yeah.
[07:49.440 --> 07:50.700]  I had 12 females of it,
[07:50.700 --> 07:53.020]  so I don't know how much he's grown it out,
[07:53.020 --> 07:55.460]  but I could tell him a little about it.
[07:55.460 --> 07:57.260]  I could use a pack of those Spence.
[07:57.260 --> 07:58.100]  Nice.
[07:58.100 --> 07:58.920]  I could use some of them.
[07:58.920 --> 08:00.020]  And then what's this last one here?
[08:00.020 --> 08:02.340]  That is Gorilla Glue.
[08:02.340 --> 08:03.960]  Gorilla Glue Raw Terps.
[08:03.960 --> 08:05.520]  So you guys, they have figured out
[08:06.220 --> 08:07.840]  how to take a plant, a cannabis plant,
[08:07.840 --> 08:09.080]  probably takes more than one plant,
[08:09.080 --> 08:10.920]  but take a large batch of cannabis
[08:10.920 --> 08:14.640]  and extract the terpenoids from that specific batch,
[08:14.640 --> 08:16.840]  that one plant, and then you can get the essence,
[08:16.840 --> 08:19.240]  the flavor, the aroma, the taste,
[08:19.240 --> 08:21.400]  and get it all in your face and all in your palate
[08:21.400 --> 08:23.640]  just with one little droplet on a dab.
[08:23.640 --> 08:25.160]  And it's amazing.
[08:25.160 --> 08:26.840]  It can actually be overwhelming.
[08:26.840 --> 08:28.000]  It is, I've said that.
[08:28.000 --> 08:33.000]  That some require far, far less than a droplet.
[08:33.080 --> 08:34.840]  Durban Poison Dabs.
[08:34.840 --> 08:36.360]  Very, very little.
[08:36.360 --> 08:37.200]  Very little.
[08:37.200 --> 08:39.040]  I overdone it on some that I took the other night
[08:39.040 --> 08:40.120]  and it was just too much.
[08:40.120 --> 08:43.120]  I was like, that was way too much Durban Poison on there.
[08:43.120 --> 08:44.840]  This glue was like that.
[08:44.840 --> 08:45.680]  Okay.
[08:45.680 --> 08:46.760]  It was really overwhelming.
[08:46.760 --> 08:48.920]  I really think the terpenes are really contributing
[08:48.920 --> 08:49.960]  to my high also.
[08:49.960 --> 08:52.760]  It makes me skyrocket to that next level.
[08:52.760 --> 08:54.920]  That became crystal clear when I started playing
[08:54.920 --> 08:57.360]  with the Distillate and the Terps.
[08:57.360 --> 08:59.720]  You're taking the same THC material,
[08:59.720 --> 09:04.120]  and when you add it to something like the Critical Mass,
[09:04.120 --> 09:05.760]  you go one way hard.
[09:05.760 --> 09:07.480]  When you add it to something like the Durban,
[09:07.480 --> 09:09.160]  you go the other way real hard.
[09:09.160 --> 09:10.400]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[09:10.400 --> 09:12.760]  And you're not changing the THC content.
[09:12.760 --> 09:13.600]  Right.
[09:13.600 --> 09:14.960]  It's the other parts of the plant
[09:14.960 --> 09:16.280]  that really shape that eye.
[09:16.280 --> 09:18.880]  That entourage effect, the synergistic effect.
[09:18.880 --> 09:20.000]  What Gupta talked about.
[09:20.000 --> 09:21.600]  Yeah, it's exactly evident.
[09:21.600 --> 09:23.920]  And when we're using the Terps like this, yeah.
[09:23.920 --> 09:24.760]  Dude, good job.
[09:24.760 --> 09:26.440]  I know your company's experimenting.
[09:26.440 --> 09:27.320]  Give your company a shout out
[09:27.320 --> 09:28.520]  so that we can hype them up a little bit.
[09:28.520 --> 09:29.800]  It's the Uncle Bud Company.
[09:29.800 --> 09:32.360]  The Uncle Bud Company based in Pueblo, Colorado, you guys.
[09:32.400 --> 09:35.000]  We were pulling raw Terps out here in Pueblo, Colorado.
[09:35.000 --> 09:35.840]  Can I-
[09:35.840 --> 09:36.680]  With no THC in them.
[09:36.680 --> 09:38.160]  Zero THC in these terpenoids?
[09:38.160 --> 09:40.680]  Zero THC, lab proven.
[09:40.680 --> 09:42.040]  Zero THC.
[09:42.040 --> 09:42.880]  Yeah.
[09:42.880 --> 09:44.760]  So these, it would not be, hypothetically,
[09:44.760 --> 09:46.520]  I'm not gonna do this, don't fucking ask.
[09:46.520 --> 09:49.480]  Hypothetically, we could make these available nationwide
[09:49.480 --> 09:51.600]  because there are no cannabinoids in there.
[09:51.600 --> 09:52.440]  Yes.
[09:52.440 --> 09:53.480]  Awesome.
[09:53.480 --> 09:56.480]  Diverting it out of metric is a whole nother story,
[09:56.480 --> 09:58.400]  but making them-
[09:58.400 --> 10:00.240]  So it's virtually impossible for that
[10:00.240 --> 10:03.720]  to leave the Colorado marijuana enforcement tracking system.
[10:03.720 --> 10:04.560]  That is stuck.
[10:04.560 --> 10:06.000]  You're not gonna get it, you guys.
[10:06.000 --> 10:08.920]  But as a consumer, once you,
[10:08.920 --> 10:10.960]  if you purchase it in a store,
[10:10.960 --> 10:13.240]  if there's no THC in it, can it travel?
[10:13.240 --> 10:14.080]  Yes.
[10:14.080 --> 10:14.920]  I would believe so.
[10:14.920 --> 10:15.740]  Yes.
[10:15.740 --> 10:16.580]  That was also my assumption.
[10:16.580 --> 10:18.040]  Because there's nothing, that's terpenoids.
[10:18.040 --> 10:19.080]  Terpenoids are not illegal.
[10:19.080 --> 10:19.920]  Cannabinoids.
[10:19.920 --> 10:20.740]  It's not a little glass vial.
[10:20.740 --> 10:22.400]  You're gonna spend a lot of time explaining that.
[10:22.400 --> 10:24.920]  It just smells like weed, officer, stop hating me.
[10:24.920 --> 10:27.200]  Go to Vitamin Cottage, get yourself some fucking-
[10:27.200 --> 10:30.560]  Theoretically, it's also legal to ship in the mail.
[10:30.560 --> 10:32.480]  I wasn't gonna go there.
[10:32.480 --> 10:35.160]  But yeah, theoretically, since it's just terpenoids,
[10:35.160 --> 10:37.440]  I mean, you can buy terpenoids-
[10:37.440 --> 10:38.880]  Vials of liquid in the mail,
[10:38.880 --> 10:40.400]  that's the thing they're big on.
[10:40.400 --> 10:43.120]  Well, like I said, theoretically.
[10:43.120 --> 10:44.840]  I'm not gonna try it, but-
[10:44.840 --> 10:46.300]  I wouldn't, folks.
[10:46.300 --> 10:48.200]  But if there's really no THC in it,
[10:48.200 --> 10:51.400]  I think there's a loop here to be played with if necessary.
[10:51.400 --> 10:53.080]  There's actually a, whoa, my mic got too hot.
[10:53.080 --> 10:55.240]  There's a website called justterps.com
[10:55.240 --> 10:56.120]  or something similar to that,
[10:56.120 --> 10:57.400]  where you can purchase terpenoids.
[10:57.400 --> 10:58.440]  You can buy limonene.
[10:58.440 --> 11:00.640]  You can buy all of the terpenoids separately.
[11:00.640 --> 11:02.840]  Is that the big, pretty wheel I've seen?
[11:02.840 --> 11:05.920]  Probably, but those terps are not derived from cannabis.
[11:05.920 --> 11:07.680]  Those are pulled from things like bananas
[11:07.680 --> 11:10.520]  and roses and oranges and other fruits.
[11:10.520 --> 11:12.080]  This is just the terps.
[11:12.080 --> 11:14.680]  And people that are not able to smoke
[11:14.680 --> 11:16.560]  this quality cannabis would be able,
[11:16.560 --> 11:18.440]  they'd have to get some dabs or some distillate
[11:18.440 --> 11:20.080]  or something to carry it.
[11:20.080 --> 11:22.400]  You could probably put this in a vape pen cartridge.
[11:22.400 --> 11:24.000]  You can mix that up with some VG,
[11:24.000 --> 11:25.800]  some vegetable glycol or something.
[11:26.480 --> 11:27.320]  All day long.
[11:27.320 --> 11:28.160]  We've tried it.
[11:28.160 --> 11:29.000]  Yeah, see, I'm just.
[11:29.000 --> 11:30.640]  It's actually pretty amazing.
[11:30.640 --> 11:33.280]  It makes vaping a little less gay.
[11:33.280 --> 11:34.320]  Yeah, yeah.
[11:34.320 --> 11:36.160]  I wasn't gonna go there about it, but yeah.
[11:36.160 --> 11:37.280]  You could put that in a vape pen
[11:37.280 --> 11:39.240]  and then you can actually taste Gorilla Glue.
[11:39.240 --> 11:40.760]  You could taste this OVM.
[11:40.760 --> 11:42.680]  You could taste the Critical Mass.
[11:42.680 --> 11:44.960]  You could taste, I've got Ghost Train Haze over here.
[11:44.960 --> 11:47.400]  I had Lemon OG or Lemon G.
[11:47.400 --> 11:49.600]  That Lemon G, you guys, people do crazy shit for me
[11:49.600 --> 11:50.440]  for the Lemon G.
[11:50.440 --> 11:51.260]  They'll stare at you like,
[11:51.260 --> 11:53.000]  can I get one of them Lemon G dabs?
[11:53.000 --> 11:54.320]  They look like they got them white lips.
[11:54.320 --> 11:55.160]  You know what I'm saying?
[11:55.760 --> 11:58.680]  For the Friday five o'clock free Lemon G dab giveaway.
[11:58.680 --> 11:59.520]  You know what I'm saying?
[11:59.520 --> 12:01.560]  They got VCRs and shit in their hand for it.
[12:01.560 --> 12:03.600]  Something about the Lemon G turps are amazing.
[12:03.600 --> 12:05.760]  I had OG Kush turps.
[12:05.760 --> 12:08.640]  There's Paradigm turps floating around here somewhere.
[12:08.640 --> 12:11.320]  It's so delicious to taste these cannabis turpines.
[12:11.320 --> 12:12.520]  We're getting spoiled.
[12:12.520 --> 12:13.440]  It's actually,
[12:15.840 --> 12:18.280]  it's really not that hard to extract them either.
[12:19.440 --> 12:21.400]  It's just the right equipment and the right knowledge.
[12:21.400 --> 12:22.240]  Yeah, yeah.
[12:22.240 --> 12:23.880]  I was gonna say, tell us what you feel comfortable sharing.
[12:23.880 --> 12:25.600]  I don't want to pry too much information out of you,
[12:25.600 --> 12:26.960]  but if there's something you want to tell us
[12:26.960 --> 12:29.880]  that we would love to know some of your process.
[12:29.880 --> 12:31.760]  I'll tell you this.
[12:31.760 --> 12:33.920]  If you get with me and give me a hundred bucks,
[12:33.920 --> 12:35.440]  I'll walk you through the entire process.
[12:35.440 --> 12:36.840]  A hundred bucks?
[12:36.840 --> 12:39.280]  I can even, I've already proven I can do it.
[12:39.280 --> 12:41.000]  I taught Rasta Seb how to do it over Facebook.
[12:41.000 --> 12:42.400]  A hundred is not enough.
[12:42.400 --> 12:43.240]  You should.
[12:43.240 --> 12:44.080]  Yeah, but I'm a nice man.
[12:44.080 --> 12:46.000]  $250 consulting fee just for showing up, bro.
[12:46.000 --> 12:46.840]  For sure.
[12:46.840 --> 12:47.680]  $250.
[12:47.680 --> 12:48.880]  But it takes,
[12:50.280 --> 12:53.160]  it takes an investment in equipment.
[12:53.600 --> 12:56.600]  How much would the equipment cost for a small operation?
[12:56.600 --> 12:59.280]  So maybe I had five pounds of plant material to run.
[12:59.280 --> 13:01.000]  How much equipment should I buy?
[13:01.000 --> 13:03.480]  What would I be spending for a five pound run?
[13:03.480 --> 13:04.960]  Yeah, good equipment.
[13:04.960 --> 13:06.960]  You're looking about 600 bucks
[13:06.960 --> 13:09.280]  and you're going to be doing five runs
[13:09.280 --> 13:10.760]  instead of one five pound run.
[13:10.760 --> 13:11.680]  Okay.
[13:11.680 --> 13:14.040]  So about a pound at a time and it's 600 bucks in equipment.
[13:14.040 --> 13:15.480]  Yeah.
[13:15.480 --> 13:16.880]  You want to go to the store?
[13:18.320 --> 13:19.560]  We can do it on the internet.
[13:19.560 --> 13:20.960]  And I got the a hundred bucks
[13:20.960 --> 13:22.720]  so that you could teach me how to do it.
[13:23.320 --> 13:24.160]  It's next week's episode.
[13:24.160 --> 13:26.000]  We're going to order a bunch of shit online.
[13:26.000 --> 13:27.200]  Yeah, the next episode you're going to come back
[13:27.200 --> 13:28.840]  and I'm going to just be sitting here covered in turps.
[13:28.840 --> 13:30.680]  I'm like, I spilled some and I don't care.
[13:30.680 --> 13:35.040]  It's a solventless process completely and totally organic.
[13:35.040 --> 13:38.400]  It takes a little bit of a chemistry background or-
[13:38.400 --> 13:39.240]  I know that guy.
[13:39.240 --> 13:40.600]  Or you just need to know someone
[13:40.600 --> 13:42.320]  who can walk you through the process.
[13:42.320 --> 13:43.360]  It's already been taught it.
[13:43.360 --> 13:44.200]  All right.
[13:44.200 --> 13:45.600]  Well between you and Brett Maverick,
[13:45.600 --> 13:46.640]  I should be able to figure it out.
[13:46.640 --> 13:47.880]  Oh yeah.
[13:47.880 --> 13:49.120]  Shout out to Brett Maverick.
[13:49.120 --> 13:51.920]  But yeah, I mean, like I said, I taught Seb how to do it.
[13:51.920 --> 13:52.760]  Okay.
[13:52.760 --> 13:54.320]  Shout out to Rasta Seb also, by the way.
[13:54.320 --> 13:56.040]  Just a quick shout out.
[13:56.040 --> 13:57.560]  Yeah. Yeah.
[13:57.560 --> 13:58.400]  I don't know if I'm ready to answer
[13:58.400 --> 14:01.600]  your Facebook messages yet, bro, but shout out on the show.
[14:01.600 --> 14:02.440]  All right.
[14:02.440 --> 14:03.400]  Let's talk about outdoor growing.
[14:03.400 --> 14:04.920]  No, no, dude, I'm over it.
[14:04.920 --> 14:07.240]  I'm just not ready to interact yet.
[14:07.240 --> 14:09.240]  Let's talk about outdoor growing.
[14:09.240 --> 14:11.440]  I brought Jesse on the show because Jesse is
[14:11.440 --> 14:12.920]  my outdoor expert.
[14:12.920 --> 14:14.600]  It's a lot of pressure on you, bro.
[14:14.600 --> 14:16.720]  My outdoor expert.
[14:16.720 --> 14:17.560]  Ouch.
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.200]  That means I don't know a lot of outdoor growers.
[14:22.600 --> 14:24.240]  Oh, come on.
[14:24.240 --> 14:25.080]  No, no, no.
[14:25.080 --> 14:25.920]  You're reliable.
[14:25.920 --> 14:28.160]  Some of the previous outdoor grow episodes
[14:28.160 --> 14:31.120]  that Jesse's done with you have been some of my favorites.
[14:31.120 --> 14:34.120]  So if I were you at home, I'd get a notepad and a pen.
[14:34.120 --> 14:35.000]  John Randall Jr.
[14:35.000 --> 14:36.280]  Get out a notepad and a pen, buddy.
[14:36.280 --> 14:38.240]  I know you're taking notes right there.
[14:38.240 --> 14:39.400]  Put down the Pokemon Go, buddy.
[14:39.400 --> 14:41.040]  It's time to take some notes about the grow.
[14:41.040 --> 14:42.040]  I try as I can wait.
[14:42.040 --> 14:42.880]  Get on it.
[14:43.920 --> 14:45.640]  Randall's, we love you, bro.
[14:45.640 --> 14:46.560]  So outdoor growing.
[14:46.560 --> 14:48.680]  You guys are probably about three weeks into flower.
[14:48.680 --> 14:50.760]  You should start seeing the pistols.
[14:50.800 --> 14:53.440]  The Calyx pistols are starting to form on your plants.
[14:53.440 --> 14:55.200]  Those little, you guys call them hairs.
[14:55.200 --> 14:56.040]  The white hairs.
[14:56.040 --> 14:57.080]  Those are popping up on your plants.
[14:57.080 --> 14:59.320]  If you've got girls, those are popping up.
[14:59.320 --> 15:02.800]  Something super important and hypercritical.
[15:02.800 --> 15:05.720]  Your boy plants need to be fucking pulled by now.
[15:05.720 --> 15:06.640]  Walk through your garden.
[15:06.640 --> 15:07.480]  Look for boys.
[15:07.480 --> 15:08.560]  Look for hermaphrodites.
[15:08.560 --> 15:09.720]  Get rid of that shit.
[15:09.720 --> 15:12.260]  Because how far can pollen travel?
[15:12.260 --> 15:13.800]  At least four miles or so.
[15:13.800 --> 15:14.680]  Very far.
[15:14.680 --> 15:17.880]  Yeah, I don't want everybody's crop getting pollinated
[15:17.880 --> 15:19.560]  because you're, whoa, excuse me.
[15:19.560 --> 15:21.400]  I just let out a full solid burp on the podcast.
[15:21.400 --> 15:22.240]  That was rad.
[15:22.240 --> 15:24.000]  I don't need everybody's crop getting pollinated
[15:24.000 --> 15:25.800]  because you're too lazy to pull a male plant
[15:25.800 --> 15:26.640]  out of your garden.
[15:26.640 --> 15:27.960]  So go outside, pull the male plants.
[15:27.960 --> 15:29.200]  If you haven't already done it,
[15:29.200 --> 15:30.360]  you might be fucking up already.
[15:30.360 --> 15:32.200]  I talked about it on another episode
[15:32.200 --> 15:34.400]  of how quickly male plants drop pollen.
[15:34.400 --> 15:36.800]  I've got a male plant in another room right over there.
[15:36.800 --> 15:38.240]  He is like 15 days in
[15:38.240 --> 15:40.560]  and he is just blasting pollen right now.
[15:40.560 --> 15:42.360]  So it only takes 15 or 16 days
[15:42.360 --> 15:44.520]  for serious trouble to start happening.
[15:44.520 --> 15:45.840]  Yep, doesn't take long.
[15:45.840 --> 15:49.120]  I've actually, I've known an amateur breeder
[15:49.680 --> 15:51.960]  that pollinated his neighbor's grow
[15:51.960 --> 15:56.400]  that was let's say 400, 500 feet away.
[15:56.400 --> 15:57.240]  Oh man.
[15:57.240 --> 16:01.080]  With trees, fences, houses, all kinds of stuff.
[16:01.080 --> 16:02.200]  Oh, pollen is amazing.
[16:02.200 --> 16:03.040]  Yeah.
[16:03.040 --> 16:03.960]  That's its whole purpose of life
[16:03.960 --> 16:05.600]  is to just land on the female plant
[16:05.600 --> 16:07.640]  and climb up that pistol and get up in there.
[16:07.640 --> 16:09.960]  Wants to get in the ovule.
[16:09.960 --> 16:13.200]  There's a couple of places that have passed special rules
[16:13.200 --> 16:15.840]  keeping hemp and marijuana grows
[16:15.840 --> 16:17.240]  like five or six miles away
[16:17.240 --> 16:21.520]  just to make sure that there's never a legal war
[16:21.520 --> 16:25.240]  between like the big hemp field and the big marijuana field.
[16:25.240 --> 16:27.160]  I totally know a solution to that.
[16:27.160 --> 16:32.160]  I would grow my sensamelia grow right next to a hemp field.
[16:33.480 --> 16:35.680]  Are you willing to expose your secret on the podcast?
[16:35.680 --> 16:37.640]  I think I know you, you told me the way.
[16:37.640 --> 16:38.480]  You told me.
[16:38.480 --> 16:39.300]  Will you tell us on the show
[16:39.300 --> 16:40.140]  or do you want to keep that a secret?
[16:40.140 --> 16:42.000]  Hemp plants only pollinate once a year
[16:42.000 --> 16:43.960]  or they only release pollen once a year.
[16:43.960 --> 16:44.800]  Oh, okay.
[16:45.760 --> 16:50.640]  Plan your bloom cycles accordingly.
[16:50.640 --> 16:51.760]  If you can.
[16:51.760 --> 16:52.600]  Yeah.
[16:53.640 --> 16:56.480]  But also most hemp growers like to grow from cloud.
[16:56.480 --> 16:58.280]  Well, there's significant other ways
[16:58.280 --> 17:01.120]  you can protect your own growth from the guy next door
[17:01.120 --> 17:04.040]  who doesn't know the difference between a male and a female.
[17:04.040 --> 17:05.880]  You just gotta, it's part of the planning
[17:05.880 --> 17:07.680]  and the research you should have done by now.
[17:07.680 --> 17:08.760]  Or he should have done.
[17:08.760 --> 17:10.040]  He should not have a male out there
[17:10.040 --> 17:11.080]  outside in the first place.
[17:11.080 --> 17:13.320]  I actually know a couple of breeders in California
[17:13.320 --> 17:14.520]  that do everything outdoors.
[17:15.240 --> 17:16.080]  I just shake my heads at them.
[17:16.080 --> 17:18.560]  I'm like, you shouldn't be doing that, bro.
[17:18.560 --> 17:20.320]  So you'll be getting buds right about now.
[17:20.320 --> 17:21.540]  You'll start seeing the bud sites.
[17:21.540 --> 17:22.380]  It's time to get in there
[17:22.380 --> 17:24.400]  and kind of take off that lower shit.
[17:24.400 --> 17:26.800]  The little, yeah, scurred them up.
[17:26.800 --> 17:27.640]  Shave the legs in there.
[17:27.640 --> 17:29.480]  You guys get in there and clean off all the lower canopy
[17:29.480 --> 17:30.600]  where the air is not getting in.
[17:30.600 --> 17:31.840]  Something where like a little squirrel
[17:31.840 --> 17:32.960]  could get help climbing up.
[17:32.960 --> 17:35.240]  The little ladder at the bottom, take that off of there.
[17:35.240 --> 17:36.720]  All that stuff that's going to hang down
[17:36.720 --> 17:38.840]  and touch the dirt, get rid of that.
[17:38.840 --> 17:40.520]  All those little sucker branches,
[17:40.520 --> 17:42.480]  just the little thin pale yellow branches
[17:42.480 --> 17:43.640]  that are just shooting up.
[17:43.640 --> 17:44.520]  Take all those off.
[17:44.520 --> 17:45.360]  You don't need those.
[17:45.360 --> 17:47.040]  Go clean up the inside a little bit.
[17:47.040 --> 17:48.640]  You want to focus on the tops of the plants.
[17:48.640 --> 17:50.160]  That's where all the magic is going to happen.
[17:50.160 --> 17:51.560]  So clean them up a little bit.
[17:51.560 --> 17:52.680]  Hollow them out.
[17:52.680 --> 17:53.960]  Yeah, hollow them out a little bit.
[17:53.960 --> 17:55.480]  Pull them apart and spread them if you can.
[17:55.480 --> 17:56.600]  If you need to get a giant stick
[17:56.600 --> 17:58.600]  and stick it in the dirt and pull one branch this way
[17:58.600 --> 17:59.480]  and one branch this way
[17:59.480 --> 18:02.000]  so that they're getting sun properly, feel free to do it.
[18:02.000 --> 18:03.280]  They could take a beating.
[18:03.280 --> 18:06.520]  Go out into your grow around noon, one o'clock
[18:06.520 --> 18:09.120]  when the sun's really high in the sky
[18:09.120 --> 18:12.560]  and everything that's not getting direct sunlight
[18:12.560 --> 18:13.760]  right then and there,
[18:15.760 --> 18:18.560]  you know, that kind of use that as a guide
[18:18.560 --> 18:19.560]  of what to take off.
[18:19.560 --> 18:21.720]  So it's, you know, I mean,
[18:21.720 --> 18:24.320]  not everything's going to be getting full sunlight,
[18:24.320 --> 18:27.120]  but, you know, things that are just in the dark,
[18:27.120 --> 18:29.920]  you know, at the bottom, you know, you can take that off.
[18:29.920 --> 18:32.760]  Things that are, you know, a little further down the side
[18:32.760 --> 18:35.000]  or bud sites that are further down the side,
[18:36.000 --> 18:37.560]  they may not be getting full sunlight,
[18:37.560 --> 18:38.600]  but they're still getting sunlight.
[18:38.600 --> 18:39.440]  Leave those there.
[18:39.440 --> 18:42.280]  So, you know, just judge accordingly,
[18:42.960 --> 18:45.900]  but all that dark stuff, you can definitely take that off.
[18:47.160 --> 18:48.360]  It's just going to be larfy.
[18:48.360 --> 18:49.880]  Yeah, you don't want to turn that
[18:49.880 --> 18:51.040]  unless you're making a bunch of hash.
[18:51.040 --> 18:52.560]  And then, I mean, maybe you leave that if you want to,
[18:52.560 --> 18:54.560]  but it's going to take away from the energy up top.
[18:54.560 --> 18:55.400]  Yeah.
[18:55.400 --> 18:56.240]  All right.
[18:56.240 --> 18:58.480]  So stretch phase should be just about over, right?
[18:58.480 --> 19:00.040]  We've got the first three weeks,
[19:00.040 --> 19:01.160]  we've really started stretching.
[19:01.160 --> 19:02.680]  That should be slowing down now.
[19:02.680 --> 19:04.180]  So we can see kind of how big our plants
[19:04.180 --> 19:05.440]  are actually going to be,
[19:05.440 --> 19:07.200]  kind of get a judgment of how tall they're going to be,
[19:07.200 --> 19:10.360]  how much panicking you need to do on readjusting that fence.
[19:10.360 --> 19:11.320]  Because a lot of people, I know,
[19:11.560 --> 19:12.380]  I know some people that are-
[19:12.380 --> 19:13.220]  We're building that second trellis.
[19:13.220 --> 19:15.160]  Yeah, well, people are growing crazy outdoor plants
[19:15.160 --> 19:16.800]  here in Pueblo, and it's completely illegal
[19:16.800 --> 19:18.160]  to grow outside in Pueblo, Colorado.
[19:18.160 --> 19:19.640]  It is banned, but there are people that are doing it,
[19:19.640 --> 19:21.400]  and they're just building a higher fence every week.
[19:21.400 --> 19:23.640]  I see them, like, had to put more plywood up.
[19:23.640 --> 19:24.880]  I spotted another one today.
[19:24.880 --> 19:27.400]  There was an old school giant back TV set
[19:27.400 --> 19:29.400]  propped against a gate on the outside
[19:29.400 --> 19:32.680]  of the target place, and I about died laughing.
[19:32.680 --> 19:34.400]  That's that time of year, you guys.
[19:34.400 --> 19:36.160]  It's going to be all over Pueblo.
[19:36.160 --> 19:37.800]  You guys, if you're growing outdoors this year
[19:37.800 --> 19:39.000]  and someone tries to steal your shit,
[19:39.000 --> 19:40.240]  don't fucking shoot them.
[19:40.240 --> 19:41.080]  Grow more weed next year.
[19:41.840 --> 19:43.200]  I don't think that we have to do this episode every year,
[19:43.200 --> 19:45.320]  but it's just weed, just let it go.
[19:45.320 --> 19:46.200]  Yeah, it's happened here, though.
[19:46.200 --> 19:47.340]  Somebody got shot trying to steal
[19:47.340 --> 19:48.640]  somebody's cannabis outdoors,
[19:48.640 --> 19:51.000]  and that medicine that was supposed to be medicine
[19:51.000 --> 19:52.320]  became a target of theft,
[19:52.320 --> 19:54.840]  which became an attempted homicide, which, fuck that.
[19:54.840 --> 19:56.880]  We don't need that vibe attached to this plant at all.
[19:56.880 --> 19:58.340]  That's why we tried to make it legal.
[19:58.340 --> 20:00.360]  That's why we wanted it safely accessible
[20:00.360 --> 20:02.040]  so nobody's getting shot over this shit.
[20:02.040 --> 20:03.760]  We took it away from the cartels,
[20:03.760 --> 20:05.880]  put it in the hands of the medical community.
[20:05.880 --> 20:06.720]  Let's do it right, you guys.
[20:06.720 --> 20:08.600]  It is not justifiable.
[20:08.600 --> 20:12.440]  It instantly makes it into a criminal element,
[20:12.440 --> 20:13.760]  or a criminal act.
[20:13.760 --> 20:14.600]  Criminal enterprise?
[20:14.600 --> 20:15.800]  Yeah.
[20:15.800 --> 20:18.480]  Now you're protecting your illegal crop.
[20:18.480 --> 20:20.200]  Yeah, don't shoot anybody, please, you guys.
[20:20.200 --> 20:21.040]  If you're listening to this,
[20:21.040 --> 20:22.600]  you're probably not gonna shoot anybody,
[20:22.600 --> 20:24.000]  and you're all peaceful, cool-ass people,
[20:24.000 --> 20:25.720]  is why you're listening to my show.
[20:25.720 --> 20:26.680]  So, stretch phase is over.
[20:26.680 --> 20:28.520]  You're gonna start seeing what size the plants are.
[20:28.520 --> 20:29.360]  Don't top.
[20:29.360 --> 20:30.360]  Don't top anymore.
[20:30.360 --> 20:31.960]  I'm glad that's one of the next things
[20:31.960 --> 20:33.400]  I had written down, is no more topping.
[20:33.400 --> 20:35.180]  The hormones in the plants have all decided
[20:35.180 --> 20:36.760]  where the tops of those plants are gonna be
[20:36.800 --> 20:38.680]  and where they need to bake the most energy,
[20:38.680 --> 20:40.040]  where they need to send the THC,
[20:40.040 --> 20:42.200]  where they need to send all the energy for budding.
[20:42.200 --> 20:43.100]  Quit topping them.
[20:43.100 --> 20:43.940]  No more topping.
[20:43.940 --> 20:45.000]  You can kind of bend them.
[20:45.000 --> 20:46.120]  You can stretch them down,
[20:46.120 --> 20:48.480]  but don't cut anymore off the tops of the plants.
[20:48.480 --> 20:50.280]  You can take all that bottom shit freely,
[20:50.280 --> 20:52.260]  but the tops where the hormones have climbed up,
[20:52.260 --> 20:53.780]  don't take that off of there.
[20:53.780 --> 20:55.640]  No more topping.
[20:55.640 --> 20:58.040]  Is it time now to adjust the nutrients
[20:58.040 --> 20:59.140]  that we're feeding them?
[20:59.140 --> 21:00.840]  Yeah, for sure.
[21:00.840 --> 21:03.880]  Probably, you know, especially by the time this comes out.
[21:03.880 --> 21:07.680]  But yeah, last week, most definitely now,
[21:07.680 --> 21:09.220]  but yeah, go for it.
[21:10.360 --> 21:12.680]  We can put this out Monday morning.
[21:13.540 --> 21:17.600]  Outdoor plants, they'll use a little more nitrogen
[21:17.600 --> 21:19.960]  than indoor plants will through the bloom cycle,
[21:19.960 --> 21:22.040]  so keep that in mind.
[21:22.040 --> 21:23.680]  You know, keep that bottle of bloom,
[21:23.680 --> 21:25.460]  or I mean, bottle of grow around.
[21:27.440 --> 21:29.480]  The way I do it is I'd probably just,
[21:29.480 --> 21:31.840]  if I felt they needed a little extra nitrogen shot,
[21:31.840 --> 21:36.440]  I'd just mix up some grow and maybe a little cow mag
[21:36.440 --> 21:40.440]  and feed that in addition to the normal feed.
[21:40.440 --> 21:43.080]  Okay, so add it on top of what you're normally feeding.
[21:43.080 --> 21:46.000]  You know, I saw Subcool take a bottle of nutrients
[21:46.000 --> 21:49.040]  and pour it directly onto the soil on his outdoor grow
[21:49.040 --> 21:50.640]  and then just watered it in.
[21:50.640 --> 21:52.480]  I wouldn't recommend that, but I saw that shit
[21:52.480 --> 21:53.520]  and it made me shake my head.
[21:53.520 --> 21:56.280]  Like, Subcool really did that, bro?
[21:56.280 --> 21:57.620]  Like, one of the most reputable growers
[21:57.620 --> 21:58.920]  you could find on the internet,
[21:58.920 --> 22:01.320]  and that dude just poured a bottle of a nutrient
[22:01.760 --> 22:03.760]  that I won't even use straight onto the dirt
[22:03.760 --> 22:04.920]  and then watered it in.
[22:04.920 --> 22:06.440]  He'd be like, it'll be just fine.
[22:06.440 --> 22:08.900]  You know, Subcool's kind of from the south a little bit.
[22:08.900 --> 22:10.400]  He's got that southern flavor to him,
[22:10.400 --> 22:12.120]  so he doesn't give two shits most of the time.
[22:12.120 --> 22:13.520]  I'll hold my tongue on this.
[22:13.520 --> 22:15.480]  Yeah, all right, let's move on from Subcool talk.
[22:15.480 --> 22:17.840]  So it's time to adjust the feed.
[22:17.840 --> 22:18.680]  You might want to keep,
[22:18.680 --> 22:20.440]  Jesse made a really good point that I didn't think about.
[22:20.440 --> 22:22.440]  These outdoor plants are going to use a little more nitrogen
[22:22.440 --> 22:25.080]  than what we're used to, so increase your nitrogen feed.
[22:25.080 --> 22:27.640]  If you're not going to be a bottle-fed nutrient kind of guy,
[22:27.640 --> 22:30.020]  what kind of stuff can we add to top dress
[22:30.020 --> 22:31.260]  to get a little more nitrogen in there?
[22:31.260 --> 22:32.500]  Yeah, now we're talking.
[22:32.500 --> 22:33.340]  No.
[22:33.340 --> 22:34.900]  Right up your alley.
[22:34.900 --> 22:39.900]  Some Neem Mill, Seabird Guano's a great all-purpose guano
[22:40.540 --> 22:42.140]  if that's your thing.
[22:43.460 --> 22:45.700]  I've quit using it, but I had a shit ton of it,
[22:45.700 --> 22:48.040]  so it's not going anywhere.
[22:48.040 --> 22:48.980]  I got to use it up.
[22:48.980 --> 22:50.780]  I'm just not going to buy any more,
[22:50.780 --> 22:55.080]  but Seabird Guano gives you PK and nitrogen,
[22:55.080 --> 22:56.620]  so it's a real good one.
[22:56.620 --> 22:58.700]  There's something about whatever they're eating,
[22:59.060 --> 23:00.940]  the fish and the kelp that's in that,
[23:00.940 --> 23:03.020]  I think that really adds to the flavor
[23:03.020 --> 23:04.980]  and the funky smell of good, cushy bud.
[23:04.980 --> 23:07.780]  I think kelp and Seabird Guano really contribute.
[23:07.780 --> 23:11.660]  I love, ocean products make the best tasting bud,
[23:11.660 --> 23:12.500]  in my opinion.
[23:12.500 --> 23:13.340]  I agree.
[23:13.340 --> 23:18.180]  I've done veganic, I've done the bone meals and blood meals,
[23:19.660 --> 23:24.660]  everything, and I love my little, my ocean-style kelp
[23:25.660 --> 23:28.780]  and crab shell meal.
[23:28.780 --> 23:31.660]  Seabird Guano works good with it, but yeah, that's.
[23:31.660 --> 23:35.220]  I like the product SeaPlex from Organicare.
[23:35.220 --> 23:36.060]  Nice, yeah.
[23:36.060 --> 23:38.740]  Definitely, it's a cold-pressed,
[23:38.740 --> 23:41.100]  blue algae-based product,
[23:41.100 --> 23:42.980]  and it makes, I think it makes the buds taste better,
[23:42.980 --> 23:45.300]  smell better, they get more density,
[23:45.300 --> 23:47.020]  and I think there's something else in there
[23:47.020 --> 23:48.820]  that just makes them grow better.
[23:48.820 --> 23:50.100]  Whatever's happening in that kelp,
[23:50.100 --> 23:52.980]  that life that's in that kelp makes my plants happier.
[23:53.020 --> 23:55.140]  It definitely gives them a little boost.
[23:55.140 --> 23:58.820]  Kelp's the fastest growing plant on the face of the planet,
[23:58.820 --> 24:02.580]  so there's all kinds of natural PGRs going on there.
[24:02.580 --> 24:04.380]  Okay, it works.
[24:04.380 --> 24:07.460]  Cytotoxins and.
[24:07.460 --> 24:08.340]  Cytokinins.
[24:08.340 --> 24:09.180]  Yeah.
[24:09.180 --> 24:10.020]  Oh, fuck.
[24:10.020 --> 24:11.060]  Oxins and cytokinins.
[24:11.060 --> 24:11.900]  Yeah.
[24:11.900 --> 24:13.300]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[24:13.300 --> 24:14.900]  Very, very happy plant food.
[24:14.900 --> 24:16.820]  Like I said, notepads.
[24:18.820 --> 24:20.740]  Yeah, some of this stuff is not for everybody.
[24:20.740 --> 24:23.820]  So here's a quick little kelp.
[24:23.820 --> 24:26.740]  Kelp is also a great bloom booster.
[24:26.740 --> 24:29.540]  So you can take kelp,
[24:29.540 --> 24:31.500]  put it in a Mason, say, a quart Mason jar,
[24:31.500 --> 24:33.220]  put a cup of kelp in there,
[24:33.220 --> 24:35.180]  go ahead and top it off with water,
[24:35.180 --> 24:37.380]  let it rehydrate for 24 hours,
[24:38.980 --> 24:42.260]  strain any extra water away if there is a little bit,
[24:43.380 --> 24:46.060]  run that kelp through your food processor,
[24:46.060 --> 24:48.680]  and that'll turn it into just a mush.
[24:49.640 --> 24:52.640]  At that point, it dissolves into water
[24:52.640 --> 24:55.520]  and you can foliar spray it as a bloom booster
[24:55.520 --> 24:56.720]  right there on your plant,
[24:56.720 --> 24:58.960]  and then store it in your refrigerator.
[25:00.200 --> 25:03.000]  In the back, keep it as cold as possible.
[25:03.000 --> 25:04.720]  That'll definitely make your plants happy.
[25:04.720 --> 25:05.560]  Yeah.
[25:05.560 --> 25:08.280]  Would you add any fulvic acid to that spray?
[25:08.280 --> 25:09.920]  That wouldn't hurt a bit.
[25:09.920 --> 25:11.720]  Make it a little more absorbable?
[25:11.720 --> 25:12.960]  That's probably the recipe
[25:12.960 --> 25:15.040]  to a lot of organic gluten boosters
[25:15.040 --> 25:15.880]  on the market right there.
[25:15.880 --> 25:17.000]  A lot, a lot, yeah.
[25:17.240 --> 25:18.720]  That's the key right there.
[25:18.720 --> 25:20.480]  Any foliar that you're spraying has got kelp in it.
[25:20.480 --> 25:23.120]  Is there silicic acid naturally in kelp like that?
[25:23.120 --> 25:24.560]  Is that where the silicic acid comes in?
[25:24.560 --> 25:26.440]  There's a little bit, but most of that,
[25:26.440 --> 25:29.200]  or the big source of that is aloe vera.
[25:29.200 --> 25:30.600]  That's really popular right now.
[25:30.600 --> 25:31.440]  Yeah, that's-
[25:31.440 --> 25:34.120]  You could easily add some aloe vera into that,
[25:34.120 --> 25:37.400]  and that's, am I actually gonna do that?
[25:37.400 --> 25:39.440]  That's a really good bloom booster, thank you.
[25:39.440 --> 25:42.880]  We just made a new product.
[25:42.880 --> 25:43.720]  Let's fucking pad this shit now.
[25:43.720 --> 25:45.920]  We also have no pads.
[25:46.480 --> 25:48.160]  Yeah, you want me to write that down?
[25:48.160 --> 25:49.000]  That's went up here.
[25:49.000 --> 25:50.120]  That went into my grower brain.
[25:50.120 --> 25:51.400]  That's in my grower brain.
[25:53.480 --> 25:54.640]  See, back in the day, we were taught
[25:54.640 --> 25:55.880]  not to take too many notes,
[25:55.880 --> 25:57.080]  because if your door got kicked in
[25:57.080 --> 25:58.880]  and there were notes that said feed on week six,
[25:58.880 --> 25:59.720]  feed on week seven,
[25:59.720 --> 26:01.760]  you just left a paper trail in your handwriting.
[26:01.760 --> 26:02.920]  You had to have those plants in there
[26:02.920 --> 26:04.800]  with no fucking notes and a good memory.
[26:04.800 --> 26:05.640]  Yep.
[26:05.640 --> 26:07.960]  Yeah, it was harder at that time.
[26:08.920 --> 26:11.240]  So many things change in legalization,
[26:11.240 --> 26:13.280]  and that's just one of the really nice ones
[26:13.280 --> 26:15.840]  that not everyone even gets to see.
[26:16.560 --> 26:21.000]  I was scared to look at it on the internet even.
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.360]  Even to Google, or back then it was like Yahoo
[26:23.360 --> 26:24.800]  or American Online.
[26:24.800 --> 26:27.600]  Were you part of overgrow.com?
[26:27.600 --> 26:30.920]  I was way too scared to ever ask questions or post on it,
[26:30.920 --> 26:31.760]  but I totally read the fuck out of that.
[26:31.760 --> 26:33.120]  Totally trolled it and looked at it?
[26:33.120 --> 26:33.960]  All right.
[26:33.960 --> 26:35.840]  Yeah, I used to go look and all that good stuff.
[26:35.840 --> 26:37.840]  I used to make up fake accounts on other sites
[26:37.840 --> 26:38.800]  and just go look like that
[26:38.800 --> 26:40.640]  before I was supposed to be doing it.
[26:41.920 --> 26:44.320]  Cannabis Culture Magazine had a really good one too
[26:44.320 --> 26:46.000]  after they shut down Overgrow.
[26:46.000 --> 26:47.800]  A lot of the people from there went.
[26:50.000 --> 26:53.120]  I got into the forums years later.
[26:53.120 --> 26:55.240]  When I got my MedCard I was like, fuck this.
[26:55.240 --> 26:57.920]  Once I had my MedCard I was game the fuck on.
[26:57.920 --> 27:00.480]  I think, and a lot of people may argue with me,
[27:00.480 --> 27:04.160]  I think that the OG Kush, the OG and OG Kush
[27:04.160 --> 27:07.040]  could be OG from overgrow.com.
[27:07.040 --> 27:08.840]  Because if you met somebody from Overgrow
[27:08.840 --> 27:11.080]  they'd just say, hey, are you fucking Jesse from OG?
[27:11.080 --> 27:13.040]  And you wouldn't, because you wouldn't want to say Overgrow
[27:13.040 --> 27:14.920]  because if it wasn't you, then I mean, I just fucked up.
[27:14.920 --> 27:16.640]  They'd be like, from what?
[27:16.640 --> 27:18.960]  Nevermind man, from this thing I do.
[27:18.960 --> 27:20.120]  So we just called it OG.
[27:20.120 --> 27:21.600]  Are you guys all on OG or what?
[27:21.600 --> 27:23.440]  I'm on overgrow.com.
[27:23.440 --> 27:26.760]  And so I think that people were shipping seeds around.
[27:26.760 --> 27:29.440]  Like one guy had a seed and he shipped some of them to Jesse
[27:29.440 --> 27:31.600]  and then Jesse grew them and found the phenotype he liked
[27:31.600 --> 27:33.800]  and bred to that and then shipped those seeds to somebody.
[27:33.800 --> 27:35.760]  And I think that somebody ended up with a bag of seeds
[27:35.760 --> 27:37.760]  and they call it the Overgrow Kush.
[27:37.760 --> 27:40.520]  And that could be completely fucking wrong.
[27:40.520 --> 27:42.520]  There's so many stories of where the OG Kush came from.
[27:42.960 --> 27:43.800]  That's my story.
[27:43.800 --> 27:44.800]  That's one of the more plausible ones that,
[27:44.800 --> 27:47.880]  I mean, that's kind of an adaptation
[27:47.880 --> 27:48.960]  of another one I've heard.
[27:48.960 --> 27:52.240]  So that's that one.
[27:52.240 --> 27:56.200]  And then the one that involves the Bubba Kush guy.
[27:56.200 --> 27:58.200]  Yeah, Matt from Florida coming out.
[27:58.200 --> 27:59.680]  That's kind of the same.
[27:59.680 --> 28:01.040]  I mean, it kind of falls in there,
[28:01.040 --> 28:03.160]  but that's the two I tend to believe personally.
[28:03.160 --> 28:04.560]  Okay.
[28:04.560 --> 28:07.360]  Yeah, there are plenty of other stories of how that happened.
[28:07.360 --> 28:09.560]  I won't even bring up the podcasts that I've heard them on.
[28:09.560 --> 28:11.800]  Having the OGs I have,
[28:11.840 --> 28:13.520]  yeah, I love OG.
[28:13.520 --> 28:14.640]  I love some good OG.
[28:14.640 --> 28:16.560]  My Jeff's OG has got some flavor to it.
[28:16.560 --> 28:18.240]  There'll be some Jeff's OG available on the shelf
[28:18.240 --> 28:19.280]  at the store pretty soon here
[28:19.280 --> 28:21.360]  that John Randall's Jr. trimmed up for us.
[28:21.360 --> 28:22.400]  It looks delicious.
[28:22.400 --> 28:23.240]  Nice.
[28:23.240 --> 28:25.440]  So we're top dressing with nitrogen heavy products.
[28:25.440 --> 28:26.520]  How about some-
[28:26.520 --> 28:28.400]  Well, not, I mean,
[28:28.400 --> 28:29.560]  to add them in there, but-
[28:29.560 --> 28:30.400]  Okay, add them in there.
[28:30.400 --> 28:31.240]  Yeah.
[28:31.240 --> 28:32.080]  All right, but don't go too hard.
[28:32.080 --> 28:34.120]  Yeah, you want to hit hard with your P's and K's.
[28:34.120 --> 28:35.280]  P's and K's now.
[28:35.280 --> 28:38.200]  Yeah, and remember it takes a week to two weeks
[28:38.200 --> 28:41.560]  on a typical top dress for it to break down enough
[28:42.320 --> 28:45.720]  to be uptakeable by the plant.
[28:45.720 --> 28:47.560]  So plan ahead.
[28:47.560 --> 28:51.000]  And if you do it right now or in the morning,
[28:52.040 --> 28:52.960]  whatever it is,
[28:54.160 --> 28:56.720]  that's not gonna really take effect for at least a week.
[28:56.720 --> 28:59.760]  So think about it.
[28:59.760 --> 29:01.480]  So if that plant is already yellowing,
[29:01.480 --> 29:02.640]  you're chasing it by now.
[29:02.640 --> 29:03.480]  Yeah.
[29:03.480 --> 29:06.800]  Yeah, so you should have done more nitrogen already.
[29:06.800 --> 29:08.200]  So next year, do more.
[29:08.200 --> 29:09.040]  Yeah, yeah.
[29:09.440 --> 29:12.360]  And I would still add nitrogen to keep it
[29:12.360 --> 29:13.200]  from getting worse.
[29:13.200 --> 29:14.800]  And that'll help your buds develop.
[29:14.800 --> 29:16.320]  It'll keep everything moving.
[29:16.320 --> 29:17.520]  All right.
[29:17.520 --> 29:18.840]  Other top dresses though,
[29:18.840 --> 29:20.800]  neem meal is a favorite of mine.
[29:20.800 --> 29:24.240]  Crab meal is good for blooming.
[29:24.240 --> 29:26.280]  And then kelp, I mean,
[29:26.280 --> 29:28.520]  most organic bloom boosters are made out of kelp.
[29:28.520 --> 29:31.000]  So that's really where you want to go.
[29:31.000 --> 29:32.920]  Do you mess with the caranja meal?
[29:32.920 --> 29:33.760]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[29:33.760 --> 29:34.600]  Okay.
[29:34.600 --> 29:35.720]  That's the neem meal mix I use.
[29:35.720 --> 29:36.560]  It's 50-50.
[29:36.560 --> 29:37.400]  Neem and caranja?
[29:37.400 --> 29:38.240]  Okay.
[29:38.240 --> 29:39.080]  That's a great mix.
[29:39.080 --> 29:40.480]  That'll keep most bugs out of the soil.
[29:40.480 --> 29:41.320]  Oh yeah.
[29:41.320 --> 29:42.160]  It'll keep most bugs out of the plants.
[29:42.160 --> 29:43.000]  Yeah.
[29:43.000 --> 29:43.840]  Yeah, and you'll never notice it
[29:43.840 --> 29:45.000]  when they're in the finished product.
[29:45.000 --> 29:47.200]  All right, so let's talk about defoliating
[29:47.200 --> 29:48.380]  because at this point of the season,
[29:48.380 --> 29:50.620]  it's time to clean up a bunch of the leaves.
[29:50.620 --> 29:52.140]  Do you like to heavily defoliate
[29:52.140 --> 29:53.940]  or do you just kind of clean them up?
[29:55.160 --> 29:58.200]  I'm more of a cleanup guy on outdoors.
[29:58.200 --> 29:59.040]  I get in there.
[29:59.040 --> 30:00.880]  I get in there and clean them the fuck up on an inorgra.
[30:00.880 --> 30:02.480]  I'll take off a lot of leaves
[30:02.480 --> 30:04.240]  to where people look at you like you're crazy,
[30:04.240 --> 30:05.920]  but then they come back a week, 10 days later,
[30:05.920 --> 30:07.800]  and all the leaves are back and they can't even tell.
[30:08.320 --> 30:09.160]  Yeah.
[30:09.160 --> 30:11.160]  I actually have a plant I'm gonna try it on this year.
[30:11.160 --> 30:15.120]  I've got three of the same strains planted in a row.
[30:15.120 --> 30:16.560]  So the one in the middle,
[30:16.560 --> 30:17.920]  they're all about the same size.
[30:17.920 --> 30:19.320]  The one in the middle is gonna get tortured?
[30:19.320 --> 30:20.160]  Yeah.
[30:20.160 --> 30:21.880]  What strain do you have?
[30:21.880 --> 30:22.840]  Northern Lights.
[30:22.840 --> 30:23.680]  Oh, nice.
[30:23.680 --> 30:25.520]  Old school Northern Lights number five?
[30:25.520 --> 30:27.920]  The cut that goes around Denver shops quite a bit.
[30:27.920 --> 30:29.160]  Is that the one that Spence bred too?
[30:29.160 --> 30:30.000]  Yeah.
[30:30.000 --> 30:30.820]  Nice, that's a good cut.
[30:30.820 --> 30:31.660]  I had that for a little bit.
[30:31.660 --> 30:34.600]  That's the cut I made my grape OG with too.
[30:34.600 --> 30:35.440]  Oh, that's a great cut.
[30:35.440 --> 30:37.600]  It makes some donkey dicks for buds for sure.
[30:38.360 --> 30:40.280]  It makes some huge, huge fucking buds.
[30:40.280 --> 30:42.600]  All right, so defoliate, you guys clean up in there.
[30:42.600 --> 30:44.280]  Basically any leaf that looks like
[30:44.280 --> 30:46.760]  it's gonna be blocking a bud site from getting sunlight,
[30:46.760 --> 30:48.120]  just go ahead and pull that fucker off.
[30:48.120 --> 30:50.040]  And it's gonna grow back because it's an outdoor plant
[30:50.040 --> 30:51.080]  and you're gonna be amazed
[30:51.080 --> 30:53.160]  at how quickly the leaves grow back.
[30:53.160 --> 30:54.760]  You'll pull off a leaf the size of your hand
[30:54.760 --> 30:57.840]  and in 10 days you'll have one back bigger than your head.
[30:57.840 --> 30:58.680]  For sure.
[30:58.680 --> 30:59.520]  They just grow and grow.
[30:59.520 --> 31:01.480]  They love the outdoors.
[31:01.480 --> 31:03.160]  All right, so we've talked about feeding a little bit.
[31:03.160 --> 31:05.440]  We talked a little bit about top dressing.
[31:05.440 --> 31:07.100]  We talked about defoliating.
[31:07.600 --> 31:09.460]  You mentioned specifically that we need to talk
[31:09.460 --> 31:11.300]  about caterpillar prevention.
[31:11.300 --> 31:12.540]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[31:12.540 --> 31:17.540]  So this is the time, it happens every year.
[31:17.740 --> 31:20.060]  What do we do to get rid of caterpillars?
[31:20.060 --> 31:23.400]  And they've already got full blown
[31:23.400 --> 31:26.380]  or full grown caterpillars inside your fully developed buds.
[31:26.380 --> 31:28.260]  You're fucked, there's nothing you can do.
[31:28.260 --> 31:30.980]  Aside from just manually picking through
[31:30.980 --> 31:32.480]  and pulling them out yourself.
[31:33.380 --> 31:34.220]  Yuck.
[31:34.220 --> 31:35.820]  Now, yeah, it sucks.
[31:35.820 --> 31:36.660]  Yuck.
[31:37.300 --> 31:41.540]  Now is the time to apply those preventative things
[31:41.540 --> 31:43.020]  that will keep them away.
[31:43.020 --> 31:45.340]  And you're gonna have to spray your bud sites.
[31:46.240 --> 31:50.460]  Spraying your, sorry.
[31:51.380 --> 31:53.660]  I just heard voices in my head jump.
[31:53.660 --> 31:55.940]  Or the volume in my head jumped.
[31:55.940 --> 31:56.780]  Just turning you up a little bit.
[31:56.780 --> 31:57.980]  You're getting far from the mic.
[31:57.980 --> 31:59.460]  I was trying to fix it, but you fixed yourself.
[31:59.460 --> 32:00.300]  You're good.
[32:01.700 --> 32:04.860]  You need some bud site for that BT to be on
[32:04.860 --> 32:08.420]  to ward off the parent from laying the egg in there
[32:08.420 --> 32:09.300]  in the first place.
[32:09.300 --> 32:13.100]  So BT is what I recommend.
[32:13.100 --> 32:15.620]  That's like Captain Jack's Monterey spray.
[32:19.220 --> 32:21.860]  BT, Bacillus thuracid.
[32:21.860 --> 32:23.260]  Bacillus thurigensis.
[32:23.260 --> 32:24.220]  Yeah, there you go.
[32:24.220 --> 32:25.500]  I think, I should Google that.
[32:25.500 --> 32:27.220]  You keep talking, I'll Google that one.
[32:27.220 --> 32:31.500]  That's what I recommend for getting rid
[32:31.500 --> 32:33.580]  of any kind of bud worm.
[32:33.620 --> 32:35.660]  And now's the time to apply it.
[32:36.700 --> 32:41.340]  Also the garlic oil ferment that you were talking about.
[32:41.340 --> 32:43.340]  Is very good for that too.
[32:43.340 --> 32:47.420]  Even just essential garlic oil from the health food store
[32:47.420 --> 32:50.740]  would probably have some of the same properties
[32:50.740 --> 32:52.300]  in it right there.
[32:52.300 --> 32:55.420]  Yes, it's Bacillus thurigensis.
[32:55.420 --> 32:57.460]  I was really close.
[32:57.460 --> 33:00.540]  So yeah, that's available from Captain Jack's.
[33:00.540 --> 33:01.900]  It's available at Monterey spray.
[33:01.940 --> 33:04.540]  It's a very, very popular product
[33:04.540 --> 33:06.540]  to use for keeping away insects.
[33:06.540 --> 33:08.820]  And it's also usable, you can use it in the soil.
[33:08.820 --> 33:10.740]  It will not cause any problems.
[33:10.740 --> 33:14.900]  The mosquito dunks that you buy at whatever Lowe's
[33:14.900 --> 33:16.740]  or Home Depot, that's the main ingredient in there.
[33:16.740 --> 33:17.780]  You can crush those up.
[33:17.780 --> 33:18.820]  You can put that in some water.
[33:18.820 --> 33:20.540]  You can water that directly into your soil.
[33:20.540 --> 33:21.900]  That will get rid of your fungus gnats.
[33:21.900 --> 33:24.420]  That'll get rid of most soil bound creatures.
[33:25.260 --> 33:27.540]  Actinovate is another brand name.
[33:27.540 --> 33:29.180]  That's a dry powdered product,
[33:29.180 --> 33:31.180]  but it's same active ingredient.
[33:31.220 --> 33:33.220]  Natural is the same thing.
[33:33.220 --> 33:35.140]  You guys, if you're gonna use any of these powdered products
[33:35.140 --> 33:37.100]  beyond the dunks, the dunks are just fine,
[33:37.100 --> 33:38.300]  probably to use without a mask.
[33:38.300 --> 33:40.020]  If you're gonna use natural or Actinovate,
[33:40.020 --> 33:41.060]  please wear a mask.
[33:41.060 --> 33:43.180]  Research everything before use.
[33:43.180 --> 33:45.060]  Yeah, when you get a new pesticide,
[33:45.060 --> 33:46.820]  if you take that little booklet that's on there,
[33:46.820 --> 33:48.260]  I know it's crazy, nobody does this.
[33:48.260 --> 33:49.660]  That little booklet, if you open it up,
[33:49.660 --> 33:51.780]  it tells you all the safety precautions.
[33:51.780 --> 33:52.620]  It tells you-
[33:52.620 --> 33:53.460]  Crazy, no one does this.
[33:53.460 --> 33:54.300]  No one does that.
[33:54.300 --> 33:55.140]  No, that's the truth though.
[33:55.140 --> 33:55.980]  I love reading those things.
[33:55.980 --> 33:58.460]  It tells you how much to apply on certain types of crops.
[33:58.460 --> 34:00.620]  It tells you how long between applications.
[34:01.060 --> 34:02.380]  It tells you what kind of safety equipment
[34:02.380 --> 34:03.220]  you need to wear.
[34:03.220 --> 34:04.060]  It tells-
[34:04.060 --> 34:05.300]  What kind of weather you need to apply it in.
[34:05.300 --> 34:06.540]  Right, because that matters.
[34:06.540 --> 34:08.620]  Because if it's gonna rain and you apply certain things,
[34:08.620 --> 34:09.700]  it's just gonna wash right off
[34:09.700 --> 34:11.700]  and you just wasted that whole application time
[34:11.700 --> 34:13.300]  and the expense on the product.
[34:14.220 --> 34:16.900]  Also in there, it tells you the re-entry interval.
[34:16.900 --> 34:18.420]  How long from spraying this product
[34:18.420 --> 34:21.540]  should you avoid this room without wearing protective gear?
[34:21.540 --> 34:23.100]  Because some of the chemicals and products
[34:23.100 --> 34:24.260]  that are available at your hydro store
[34:24.260 --> 34:26.380]  are much more toxic and dangerous than you realize.
[34:26.380 --> 34:28.060]  They expect you to be a responsible adult
[34:28.060 --> 34:29.540]  that can read that label.
[34:29.700 --> 34:31.620]  That bear stuff, the bear spray they sell
[34:31.620 --> 34:34.900]  for your outdoor house at Lowe's, that can kill you.
[34:34.900 --> 34:36.460]  That can completely kill a human
[34:36.460 --> 34:37.660]  if you fuck around and do it wrong.
[34:37.660 --> 34:38.940]  So pay attention to the labels, you guys.
[34:38.940 --> 34:39.980]  Read that shit.
[34:39.980 --> 34:41.100]  Read the safety sheets in there.
[34:41.100 --> 34:41.980]  It's really important.
[34:41.980 --> 34:43.140]  I know I sound like I'm preaching to you,
[34:43.140 --> 34:45.940]  but a lot of the things that you can get from these products
[34:45.940 --> 34:48.620]  you won't notice until 10 or 12 years down the line.
[34:48.620 --> 34:50.420]  You'll start getting a facial tick or something
[34:50.420 --> 34:52.460]  and it'll be from that time you sprayed fluoromite
[34:52.460 --> 34:54.540]  into the fan and it came back into your face.
[34:54.540 --> 34:55.660]  That's how they affect you too.
[34:55.660 --> 34:59.180]  It's most, the nervous system and reproductive system.
[34:59.820 --> 35:01.220]  It's the exact same thing they do to the insects.
[35:01.220 --> 35:02.340]  They're intended to kill.
[35:02.340 --> 35:04.500]  Yeah, it's just gonna take a little while longer on you
[35:04.500 --> 35:07.420]  because you're fucking 160 pounds.
[35:07.420 --> 35:09.500]  All right, so caterpillar prevention.
[35:09.500 --> 35:12.380]  Use that Bacillus Thurigensis spray.
[35:12.380 --> 35:13.700]  It's available in Captain Jack's.
[35:13.700 --> 35:15.380]  Monterey Insect Spray has it.
[35:15.380 --> 35:17.740]  You guys, a very good recommendation for you.
[35:17.740 --> 35:18.580]  They do not pay me.
[35:18.580 --> 35:19.640]  They don't sponsor me in any way.
[35:19.640 --> 35:24.040]  There's a company called arbico.com, A-R-B-I-C-O.com.
[35:24.040 --> 35:26.580]  They sell all types of horticultural supply,
[35:26.580 --> 35:28.360]  gardening supply type stuff.
[35:28.360 --> 35:31.720]  You can buy almost any type of sprays you want.
[35:31.720 --> 35:32.960]  You can buy organic sprays.
[35:32.960 --> 35:34.080]  You could buy crazy.
[35:34.080 --> 35:37.640]  They sell anything from stylet oil to fluoromite
[35:37.640 --> 35:38.920]  in this one catalog.
[35:38.920 --> 35:40.560]  They also sell beneficial insects.
[35:40.560 --> 35:42.080]  They sell beneficial insects.
[35:42.080 --> 35:43.640]  That is something I was gonna talk about
[35:43.640 --> 35:44.840]  on a future episode with you,
[35:44.840 --> 35:46.320]  but let's jump into it for a minute.
[35:46.320 --> 35:48.700]  Beneficial insects is now the time to release
[35:48.700 --> 35:51.920]  my whole bunch of beneficial insects.
[35:51.920 --> 35:55.000]  Yeah, yeah, I mean, that'd be totally cool.
[35:55.000 --> 35:56.400]  Predator mites and ladybugs?
[35:56.400 --> 35:57.240]  For sure.
[35:57.240 --> 35:58.080]  Lacewigs?
[35:58.820 --> 36:01.360]  I'd go for ladybug larvae, especially outdoors.
[36:02.780 --> 36:05.400]  The larvae are a lot more productive,
[36:05.400 --> 36:06.800]  meaning they eat more shit.
[36:06.800 --> 36:08.320]  Okay, because they're still growing?
[36:08.320 --> 36:09.160]  Yeah.
[36:09.160 --> 36:09.980]  Yeah, okay.
[36:09.980 --> 36:11.680]  And they'll hang around longer too.
[36:11.680 --> 36:13.560]  All right, what's the trick to keeping ladybugs
[36:13.560 --> 36:14.380]  to stick around?
[36:14.380 --> 36:15.720]  Is there a trick to that?
[36:15.720 --> 36:17.720]  I've heard some pretty awful things.
[36:19.840 --> 36:23.060]  For me, outdoors is where I use them most
[36:23.060 --> 36:26.720]  and just having a nice welcoming environment.
[36:28.840 --> 36:31.640]  There's not normally many pests on the plants,
[36:31.640 --> 36:33.960]  but there can be pests found in the mulches
[36:33.960 --> 36:35.520]  and the garden beds around,
[36:35.520 --> 36:38.160]  so I think that works to keep them around.
[36:38.160 --> 36:39.800]  Stick around there too, okay.
[36:39.800 --> 36:42.000]  How do you feel about a praying mantis?
[36:42.000 --> 36:42.840]  They're awesome.
[36:42.840 --> 36:43.660]  They're awesome.
[36:43.660 --> 36:44.500]  We've got a shit ton of them.
[36:44.500 --> 36:47.400]  Okay, so arbico.com happens to sell
[36:47.400 --> 36:48.720]  praying mantis larvae.
[36:48.720 --> 36:51.160]  You can order them, set the larvae on a plant,
[36:51.160 --> 36:53.520]  they will hatch and come alive in your garden.
[36:53.520 --> 36:54.360]  You can watch it happen.
[36:54.360 --> 36:55.360]  It's kind of cool.
[36:55.360 --> 36:56.200]  I haven't seen it happen,
[36:56.200 --> 36:57.240]  but I've seen videos of it
[36:57.240 --> 36:58.860]  because I'm kind of an internet nerd.
[36:58.860 --> 36:59.700]  But yeah, check them out.
[36:59.700 --> 37:00.780]  That company does not pay me anything,
[37:00.780 --> 37:03.120]  but I mean, they've got all the products that you need.
[37:03.120 --> 37:05.760]  If you want a preventative to keep the bugs away,
[37:05.760 --> 37:07.820]  if you want something a little stronger to destroy them,
[37:07.820 --> 37:10.720]  or if you want to go full fucking madness nuclear,
[37:10.720 --> 37:12.340]  they've got the product for you.
[37:12.340 --> 37:13.240]  You can order it from there.
[37:13.240 --> 37:14.880]  They'll ship it to you quickly.
[37:14.880 --> 37:15.720]  Check them out.
[37:15.720 --> 37:16.540]  I use that product.
[37:16.540 --> 37:17.680]  I use that catalog all the time.
[37:17.680 --> 37:19.520]  Just for plenty of research to compare things.
[37:19.520 --> 37:20.360]  Oh, I know.
[37:20.360 --> 37:21.520]  Yeah.
[37:21.520 --> 37:23.360]  What is this versus this, which is better?
[37:23.360 --> 37:24.720]  And you just hold the page side by side
[37:24.720 --> 37:26.360]  and see what you like better and read them.
[37:26.400 --> 37:28.000]  Yeah, they've got everything in there.
[37:28.000 --> 37:29.440]  But again, if you get some floor mite,
[37:29.440 --> 37:30.720]  if you get something crazy,
[37:30.720 --> 37:34.920]  get yourself a Tyvek suit and some gloves, a mask, suit up,
[37:34.920 --> 37:36.720]  go all Walter White style in that shit.
[37:36.720 --> 37:37.560]  Do it properly.
[37:37.560 --> 37:38.800]  Don't get sick.
[37:38.800 --> 37:40.160]  And I also think you're a bastard
[37:40.160 --> 37:41.640]  for spraying that shit outside.
[37:41.640 --> 37:43.280]  Yeah, don't ever spray it outside.
[37:43.280 --> 37:44.120]  Yeah.
[37:44.120 --> 37:44.960]  Don't kill bees.
[37:44.960 --> 37:46.880]  And that shit wipes eyes out.
[37:48.800 --> 37:49.640]  Just personal opinion.
[37:49.640 --> 37:51.640]  Without the bees, you don't have any food, right?
[37:51.640 --> 37:52.960]  Especially me, I'm a vegetarian.
[37:52.960 --> 37:54.200]  Everything I eat grows.
[37:54.200 --> 37:55.120]  We don't have a lot of food.
[37:55.120 --> 37:58.160]  Everything I eat either grows or eats.
[37:58.160 --> 37:59.520]  Eat something that grows.
[37:59.520 --> 38:00.800]  Your food eats my food.
[38:00.800 --> 38:01.640]  Yep.
[38:01.640 --> 38:02.760]  It's not fair.
[38:02.760 --> 38:06.280]  It'd be a pretty shitty place without pollinators.
[38:06.280 --> 38:07.720]  Yeah, absolutely.
[38:07.720 --> 38:09.720]  So we want ladybugs.
[38:09.720 --> 38:12.280]  We want beneficial predators.
[38:12.280 --> 38:14.040]  Predatory mites is what I'm thinking.
[38:14.040 --> 38:16.560]  We want some of the praying mantises.
[38:16.560 --> 38:20.080]  What other kind of bugs can we put out there to help us out?
[38:20.080 --> 38:21.320]  Worms in your soil.
[38:21.320 --> 38:22.160]  Okay.
[38:22.160 --> 38:23.200]  Oh yeah, put worms in the soil.
[38:23.200 --> 38:24.040]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[38:24.080 --> 38:25.480]  A spider, good luck in your garden.
[38:25.480 --> 38:27.920]  Is it a good thing to have one or two spiders?
[38:27.920 --> 38:29.200]  We've got a few.
[38:29.200 --> 38:31.080]  Right, they'll eat most of the other bugs, right?
[38:31.080 --> 38:31.920]  Yeah.
[38:31.920 --> 38:33.000]  How about a wasp?
[38:33.000 --> 38:33.960]  We've got those too.
[38:33.960 --> 38:34.800]  Okay.
[38:34.800 --> 38:35.920]  They're not gonna cause any problems, are they?
[38:35.920 --> 38:37.240]  No, not really.
[38:37.240 --> 38:40.240]  I've actually watched the wasps
[38:40.240 --> 38:44.000]  carry away a full grown budworm before.
[38:44.000 --> 38:45.200]  Wow.
[38:45.200 --> 38:46.800]  Okay, here in Colorado, we get something
[38:46.800 --> 38:49.440]  that I don't know if these happen anywhere else.
[38:49.440 --> 38:51.080]  And Mike will remember these.
[38:51.080 --> 38:52.840]  My microphone cover is bright orange.
[38:52.840 --> 38:54.680]  We get these orange budworms.
[38:54.680 --> 38:57.800]  I've heard them called melon worms before.
[38:57.800 --> 38:59.880]  Do you get those in your buds around here?
[38:59.880 --> 39:01.320]  I've never had those ones.
[39:01.320 --> 39:04.760]  I get like the, they're like a brownish green color.
[39:04.760 --> 39:05.600]  Okay.
[39:05.600 --> 39:07.080]  But they're all, I mean,
[39:07.080 --> 39:09.320]  they're all beetles of some kind, I believe.
[39:09.320 --> 39:10.160]  All right.
[39:10.160 --> 39:13.480]  So it's, but I have seen the orange ones.
[39:13.480 --> 39:15.520]  Is the Captain Jack's and the Monterey spray
[39:15.520 --> 39:16.920]  gonna keep that shit away?
[39:16.920 --> 39:19.800]  Yeah, it affects them all equally.
[39:19.800 --> 39:20.960]  I mean, for the most part.
[39:20.960 --> 39:23.480]  If you got something really exotic and crazy,
[39:24.520 --> 39:25.360]  you know, I don't know,
[39:25.360 --> 39:27.200]  but I know here in Southern Colorado,
[39:27.200 --> 39:29.640]  it takes care of anything.
[39:29.640 --> 39:30.480]  So.
[39:30.480 --> 39:31.800]  So if somebody is local,
[39:31.800 --> 39:33.680]  if they're here in the Pueblo, Colorado area,
[39:33.680 --> 39:36.760]  where can they go pick up some good sprays
[39:36.760 --> 39:39.040]  to take care of their insects?
[39:39.040 --> 39:40.520]  One Love Garden Supply.
[39:40.520 --> 39:41.560]  That's it, isn't that?
[39:41.560 --> 39:42.760]  Let me see if I can remember the address.
[39:42.760 --> 39:45.560]  It's 116 East 4th Street, right?
[39:45.560 --> 39:46.400]  618.
[39:46.400 --> 39:47.240]  618.
[39:47.240 --> 39:48.080]  I had the right numbers.
[39:48.080 --> 39:48.920]  I was close.
[39:48.920 --> 39:49.760]  I was close.
[39:49.760 --> 39:50.600]  It was dyslexic or some shit on there.
[39:50.960 --> 39:53.000]  Yeah, 618 East 4th Street.
[39:53.000 --> 39:54.560]  Go support One Love Garden Supply.
[39:54.560 --> 39:55.400]  For sure.
[39:55.400 --> 39:56.240]  Burns down there.
[39:56.240 --> 39:57.060]  She's a great lady.
[39:57.060 --> 39:57.900]  She'll take good care of you.
[39:57.900 --> 39:59.440]  Go say hi to my beautiful wife.
[39:59.440 --> 40:00.280]  Yeah, go say hi.
[40:00.280 --> 40:01.100]  Go support that place.
[40:01.100 --> 40:02.880]  Go support local businesses if you can, guys.
[40:02.880 --> 40:03.720]  For sure.
[40:03.720 --> 40:04.540]  Do that.
[40:04.540 --> 40:05.380]  Awesome.
[40:05.380 --> 40:06.220]  All right, we've been going for like 40 minutes
[40:06.220 --> 40:07.040]  talking about outdoor growing.
[40:07.040 --> 40:08.520]  If you guys have any outdoor grow questions
[40:08.520 --> 40:10.800]  that you would like me to ask Jesse,
[40:10.800 --> 40:11.640]  send them to me.
[40:11.640 --> 40:14.360]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[40:14.360 --> 40:15.520]  I would love to hear from you.
[40:15.520 --> 40:16.760]  I will compile the questions.
[40:16.760 --> 40:18.120]  I'll take screenshots into my phone.
[40:18.120 --> 40:19.800]  I'll put them all in one little section,
[40:19.800 --> 40:21.320]  and then I'll get Jesse back over here,
[40:21.320 --> 40:23.600]  and we will address your question specifically
[40:23.600 --> 40:26.880]  so that we can help you out with exactly what you need.
[40:26.880 --> 40:27.720]  Oh yeah.
[40:27.720 --> 40:29.080]  Kind of dial it in and aim it a little more at you
[40:29.080 --> 40:30.880]  specifically and get what you need.
[40:31.800 --> 40:32.760]  One other quick thing.
[40:32.760 --> 40:34.760]  Plants are gonna start using more water.
[40:36.880 --> 40:38.640]  Don't just give them what they'll take
[40:38.640 --> 40:40.240]  and what they need to stay perked up.
[40:40.240 --> 40:41.600]  If you want big fat buds,
[40:41.600 --> 40:43.600]  you gotta get them lots of water.
[40:43.600 --> 40:44.440]  Lots of water.
[40:44.440 --> 40:47.080]  I guess that mainly applies to in-ground plants,
[40:47.080 --> 40:52.080]  but same for a potted container.
[40:52.400 --> 40:55.120]  I mean, it'll only take so much water.
[40:55.120 --> 40:56.840]  Right, but as soon as it dries, give it some more.
[40:56.840 --> 40:57.680]  Oh yeah.
[40:57.680 --> 40:58.520]  Don't be shy.
[40:58.520 --> 40:59.360]  And don't sleep in and think
[40:59.360 --> 41:00.520]  you can water those plants later.
[41:00.520 --> 41:01.480]  Nope, you can't.
[41:01.480 --> 41:02.960]  You gotta get out there and water them right now.
[41:02.960 --> 41:05.080]  If you're not willing to stay on it, don't start it.
[41:05.080 --> 41:05.920]  That's the truth.
[41:05.920 --> 41:08.200]  If you let them dry out,
[41:08.200 --> 41:10.840]  it's a noticeable chunk out of your harvest.
[41:10.840 --> 41:11.680]  Yeah.
[41:11.680 --> 41:14.360]  I'm sure it's a noticeable percentage.
[41:14.360 --> 41:15.960]  It's like that in indoor or outdoor.
[41:15.960 --> 41:16.800]  Yeah.
[41:17.560 --> 41:18.400]  How do you feel about using a drip system
[41:18.400 --> 41:19.400]  in an outdoor grow?
[41:19.400 --> 41:20.240]  Awesome.
[41:20.240 --> 41:21.320]  Awesome, okay.
[41:21.320 --> 41:22.760]  I've promised the listeners that I would talk
[41:22.760 --> 41:23.920]  about building a drip system,
[41:23.920 --> 41:26.520]  but it's not a lot of plant involvement
[41:26.520 --> 41:28.040]  and I don't want to spend too much of an episode
[41:28.040 --> 41:30.400]  talking about building PVC pipes.
[41:30.400 --> 41:32.040]  That'd actually kind of be a hard episode
[41:32.040 --> 41:33.680]  because it's not really hard.
[41:33.680 --> 41:34.520]  Right.
[41:34.520 --> 41:36.040]  It's just something that, just go do it.
[41:36.040 --> 41:39.040]  Just get your hands dirty and do it.
[41:39.040 --> 41:39.880]  There you go, that's perfect.
[41:39.880 --> 41:41.440]  I'll give them like a five or 10 minute primer.
[41:41.440 --> 41:42.280]  Yeah.
[41:42.280 --> 41:43.120]  Like here's what you need.
[41:43.120 --> 41:44.520]  You need a pump and some tubes and a fucking octopus head
[41:44.520 --> 41:45.960]  and then some tubing and some sprinklers
[41:46.000 --> 41:47.080]  and then you build that.
[41:47.080 --> 41:48.920]  It seems really daunting, but.
[41:48.920 --> 41:49.800]  Tutorial.
[41:49.800 --> 41:52.160]  Yeah, just get, like Jesse said, just doing it
[41:52.160 --> 41:53.440]  because you got to get out there and measure.
[41:53.440 --> 41:56.400]  You need a tape measure and a PVC pipe cutter
[41:56.400 --> 41:58.440]  and just got to go to town to learn how to build.
[41:58.440 --> 41:59.720]  It's like Legos basically.
[41:59.720 --> 42:03.120]  I bought these two $30 kits from Lowe's
[42:03.120 --> 42:05.480]  and like I'd never, this was last year.
[42:05.480 --> 42:07.720]  I'd never really done a drip system before.
[42:07.720 --> 42:10.120]  I was a little nervous and by the afternoon,
[42:10.120 --> 42:11.800]  I'm like, I'm a fucking expert.
[42:11.800 --> 42:12.640]  Yeah.
[42:12.640 --> 42:13.480]  Yeah, it's really.
[42:14.200 --> 42:16.400]  It's really not that hard.
[42:16.400 --> 42:18.520]  Boys playing with Legos is essentially what it is.
[42:18.520 --> 42:20.400]  They have all of the parts over there at Lowe's.
[42:20.400 --> 42:21.960]  If you go to that little section and look around,
[42:21.960 --> 42:23.120]  your head will just start spinning
[42:23.120 --> 42:23.960]  and you'll know what to do.
[42:23.960 --> 42:25.680]  I'll do a quick lesson on it in the future here.
[42:25.680 --> 42:26.840]  I might let you come hang out with me
[42:26.840 --> 42:28.120]  and talk me through it also.
[42:28.120 --> 42:29.040]  It'll be fun.
[42:29.040 --> 42:30.160]  All right guys, we've gone 40 minutes.
[42:30.160 --> 42:31.280]  Is there anything funny you want to ramble
[42:31.280 --> 42:33.000]  and talk about chaotically, randomly
[42:33.000 --> 42:34.760]  that you want to make sure that people hear on a podcast?
[42:34.760 --> 42:35.600]  Anything you got coming up
[42:35.600 --> 42:38.000]  that you want to share with people?
[42:38.000 --> 42:38.960]  I just put you guys on the spot
[42:38.960 --> 42:40.520]  and you both look at me blankly.
[42:40.520 --> 42:41.760]  Secret session's coming up, you guys.
[42:41.760 --> 42:44.720]  August 27th, I cannot reveal the location,
[42:44.720 --> 42:45.560]  but it is coming up.
[42:45.560 --> 42:46.380]  I should be there.
[42:46.380 --> 42:47.220]  It's a secret.
[42:47.220 --> 42:48.060]  It's a secret.
[42:48.060 --> 42:49.320]  Shh.
[42:49.320 --> 42:50.600]  It's the same day as Reggae on the Rocks,
[42:50.600 --> 42:52.480]  so I've got to go to Reggae on the Rocks.
[42:52.480 --> 42:54.400]  But the headlining, I'm not into the headlining band.
[42:54.400 --> 42:55.920]  I'm just not feeling it.
[42:55.920 --> 42:56.760]  That'll happen.
[42:56.760 --> 42:58.680]  So I'm going to leave during the headlining band
[42:58.680 --> 43:00.680]  and then I'm going to go over to secret session.
[43:00.680 --> 43:01.880]  Mike, I wish I could tag you in
[43:01.880 --> 43:03.400]  for the headlining band, bro.
[43:03.400 --> 43:04.520]  Oh, is it my boys?
[43:04.520 --> 43:05.360]  It's your boys.
[43:05.360 --> 43:06.180]  Hey, guys.
[43:06.180 --> 43:07.020]  It's your boys.
[43:07.020 --> 43:07.840]  Yeah, sorry, no offense.
[43:07.840 --> 43:08.680]  It's just not my thing.
[43:08.680 --> 43:09.520]  Well, now.
[43:09.520 --> 43:10.340]  Wait.
[43:10.340 --> 43:12.220]  They're able to play Reggae on the Rocks.
[43:12.220 --> 43:14.220]  Like, I'm less of a fan than I used to be.
[43:14.220 --> 43:15.060]  Mike's favorite band is-
[43:15.060 --> 43:16.180]  Those guys?
[43:16.180 --> 43:18.380]  311 is Mike's favorite band ever.
[43:18.380 --> 43:19.380]  Reggae on the Rocks?
[43:19.380 --> 43:20.860]  Yeah, they're playing with Iration.
[43:20.860 --> 43:24.180]  It's 311 and Iration doing a set together.
[43:24.180 --> 43:25.100]  Oh, man, at Red Rocks,
[43:25.100 --> 43:27.220]  Red Rocks is such a beautiful venue for that band.
[43:27.220 --> 43:28.060]  Yeah.
[43:28.060 --> 43:29.340]  That's like the first time a plebeian
[43:29.340 --> 43:31.740]  snuck into the Roman council or some shit like that.
[43:31.740 --> 43:32.580]  Oh.
[43:32.580 --> 43:34.660]  They've been,
[43:34.660 --> 43:37.420]  Reggae on the Rocks has been not as reggae every year.
[43:37.420 --> 43:38.260]  Yeah, no.
[43:38.260 --> 43:39.260]  That's the politest way to say that.
[43:39.740 --> 43:42.180]  While the band has gotten slightly more reggae.
[43:42.180 --> 43:45.380]  Two of my favorite reggae bands ever
[43:45.380 --> 43:47.220]  are opening the show.
[43:47.220 --> 43:49.140]  Steel Pulse, of course, if you're a reggae fan,
[43:49.140 --> 43:50.140]  you know good old Steel Pulse.
[43:50.140 --> 43:51.060]  If you've ever hung out with me,
[43:51.060 --> 43:52.500]  you know I love Steel Pulse.
[43:52.500 --> 43:54.700]  And Morgan Heritage is also there.
[43:54.700 --> 43:56.380]  And those are my two favorite,
[43:56.380 --> 43:58.380]  like, if I had to just pick two reggae bands
[43:58.380 --> 44:00.100]  that defined what I like about reggae,
[44:00.100 --> 44:01.620]  those would be the bands.
[44:01.620 --> 44:03.180]  So that's a great show for me.
[44:03.180 --> 44:04.020]  It'll be the afternoon.
[44:04.020 --> 44:04.860]  I'll get all sunburned.
[44:04.860 --> 44:05.680]  I'll have a good time.
[44:05.680 --> 44:06.520]  Nice.
[44:06.520 --> 44:08.860]  And then when it starts getting all 311-y,
[44:09.260 --> 44:11.300]  that's when I'm gonna take off.
[44:11.300 --> 44:12.140]  Yeah.
[44:12.140 --> 44:14.100]  Oh my God, 311's gonna come on.
[44:14.100 --> 44:15.820]  Your hair is so cool.
[44:15.820 --> 44:19.620]  I met 311 backstage at Warped Tour one time.
[44:19.620 --> 44:22.100]  I won tickets and a meet and greet from Kilo.
[44:22.100 --> 44:22.940]  That's fucking rad.
[44:22.940 --> 44:24.100]  Yeah, it was cool.
[44:24.100 --> 44:25.940]  The dopest thing was this dope-ass
[44:25.940 --> 44:29.180]  Jansport backpack I got in the giveaway too.
[44:29.180 --> 44:31.620]  Because I'm not a 311 fan either.
[44:31.620 --> 44:35.020]  Actually, there's a 311 used to actually
[44:35.020 --> 44:36.780]  get in fist fights with Sublime,
[44:36.780 --> 44:38.180]  which is my favorite band.
[44:38.220 --> 44:39.460]  And I know that a lot of people,
[44:39.460 --> 44:41.300]  they sound like the exact same band.
[44:41.300 --> 44:44.740]  But, so I don't like 311.
[44:44.740 --> 44:47.580]  And the whole time I was bringing up all these fights
[44:47.580 --> 44:49.940]  and these guys are like, man, these guys are lame.
[44:49.940 --> 44:51.700]  And just kind of wandered off.
[44:51.700 --> 44:55.020]  I was like 19 years old, so.
[44:55.020 --> 44:55.860]  Nice.
[44:55.860 --> 44:57.580]  You weren't as polite as you are now either.
[44:57.580 --> 44:58.420]  No, no.
[44:58.420 --> 45:00.200]  I'm sure you were having a little more fun with them
[45:00.200 --> 45:01.860]  than you're letting on.
[45:01.860 --> 45:02.900]  You might've trolled them a little bit
[45:02.900 --> 45:04.820]  before trolling people was a thing.
[45:04.820 --> 45:05.660]  Totally.
[45:05.700 --> 45:06.540]  Yeah.
[45:06.540 --> 45:09.940]  All right, let's remind everybody how they can check us

[46:53.660 --> 46:56.180]  Outdoor harvest can be very overwhelming.
[46:56.180 --> 46:57.020]  Yep, yep.
[46:57.020 --> 46:57.840]  Don't be shy.
[46:57.840 --> 46:59.500]  I know somebody that from their Facebook post
[46:59.500 --> 47:01.380]  looks like they're a wee bit overwhelmed.
[47:01.380 --> 47:02.220]  Oh.
[47:03.040 --> 47:04.060]  I have two people that still haven't trimmed
[47:04.060 --> 47:05.380]  all their shit from last year.
[47:05.380 --> 47:07.060]  And they put, I'm not even kidding.
[47:07.060 --> 47:09.460]  And they put themselves in an even worse predicament
[47:09.460 --> 47:10.300]  this year.
[47:10.300 --> 47:11.140]  Oof.
[47:11.140 --> 47:11.960]  Yeah.
[47:11.960 --> 47:13.500]  It sounds like you know them very well.
[47:13.500 --> 47:14.340]  Uh-huh.
[47:14.340 --> 47:17.060]  All right, don't be shy, you guys.
