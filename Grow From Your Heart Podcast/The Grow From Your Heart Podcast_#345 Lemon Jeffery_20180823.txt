[00:04.600 --> 00:21.360]  Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[00:21.360 --> 00:24.880]  It's time for episode 345 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:24.880 --> 00:28.280]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:28.280 --> 00:31.280]  That's right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:31.280 --> 00:35.040]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:35.040 --> 00:38.200]  or even someone who is just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:38.200 --> 00:43.480]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you. I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:43.480 --> 00:45.200]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:47.560 --> 00:50.760]  This episode of the show is brought to you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed
[00:50.760 --> 00:54.280]  Company. If you need new regular or feminized seeds for your garden,
[00:54.440 --> 00:58.360]  I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company and you can find them at

[01:03.520 --> 01:05.760]  smokers and growers, roll up a fat spliff,
[01:05.960 --> 01:09.600]  put some fresh water in the bong and start heating up that dab nail because it's
[01:09.600 --> 01:12.760]  time for a fresh episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:14.120 --> 01:19.040]  What's up podcast world. Welcome to episode 345.
[01:19.040 --> 01:20.160]  Thanks again for joining me.
[01:20.400 --> 01:23.440]  You know I like to start these episodes off by letting you know what I'm smoking
[01:23.440 --> 01:24.000]  on.
[01:24.000 --> 01:29.000]  I just took a ridiculous dab of some Infinity OG nectar from Green Dot Labs.
[01:29.240 --> 01:32.680]  This is a combination of Underdog OG and I-95.
[01:33.120 --> 01:36.280]  The label describes it as gas and earth, and I completely agree.
[01:36.280 --> 01:39.240]  It's gas and earth and a little bit of a punch to the face.
[01:39.880 --> 01:43.760]  I'm always a fan of Underdog OG. That's also known as a Lumpa's headband.
[01:43.880 --> 01:46.080]  And I've always been a fan of the I-95.
[01:46.320 --> 01:50.000]  Both of those strains have got a gassy, fuely, funky,
[01:50.360 --> 01:53.160]  kind of chemmy kind of smell and aroma and flavor to them.
[01:53.160 --> 01:57.000]  And that's right up my alley. So the Infinity OG nectar is a beautiful blend.
[01:57.000 --> 01:59.840]  I definitely approve. You can tell it's got me rambly,
[02:00.760 --> 02:05.320]  but that's a good thing because this episode is about one of my favorite
[02:05.320 --> 02:06.160]  things.
[02:06.920 --> 02:11.480]  A lot of my audience has shown that they really enjoy when I do strain
[02:11.480 --> 02:15.280]  reports. If you're not aware already, I am iRegenetics.
[02:15.280 --> 02:19.520]  I am the breeder and founder and sole proprietor of iRegenetics Colorado.
[02:20.040 --> 02:22.440]  I do all of the breeding work. I do all of the selection.
[02:22.440 --> 02:25.760]  I do the male selection, the female selection. I do all the pollination.
[02:26.160 --> 02:29.360]  I do all of the seed collection. I do all of the packaging.
[02:29.360 --> 02:31.600]  I handle all of the emails and social medias.
[02:32.080 --> 02:36.480]  Just about everything except distribution is all on me.
[02:37.240 --> 02:39.280]  But over the years working as iRegenetics,
[02:39.280 --> 02:42.240]  I have developed quite a few notable strains.
[02:43.040 --> 02:45.600]  And I keep mentioning that you guys like it when I do strain reports.
[02:45.640 --> 02:49.600]  So that's where we are. We are going to do a report on Lemon Jeffrey.
[02:50.160 --> 02:53.120]  Let's talk about one of my proudest and favorite crosses.
[02:53.120 --> 02:55.880]  And let's just do a side rant because I'm famous for that shit.
[02:55.880 --> 02:59.160]  Also somebody asked me what my favorite strain was.
[02:59.160 --> 03:01.320]  And I said, I couldn't decide on my favorite strain.
[03:01.440 --> 03:03.480]  They were asking my favorite strain I've bred.
[03:04.000 --> 03:07.360]  I could not decide. I said I would give them my top three favorite.
[03:07.600 --> 03:11.960]  My top three favorite strains that I have bred in no particular order
[03:12.160 --> 03:16.440]  are the Lemon Jeffrey, Arise, and the Grateful Dog.
[03:16.760 --> 03:19.640]  And I can tell you really quickly why those are my top three favorites.
[03:19.640 --> 03:23.520]  The Lemon Jeffrey is my favorite because that lemon flavor,
[03:24.120 --> 03:28.840]  that limonene flavor, that smooth lemon candy, the high to it is beautiful.
[03:28.840 --> 03:30.680]  It makes my eyes vibrate.
[03:30.680 --> 03:33.840]  It's fun to grow. It's really easy to grow. It's really photogenic.
[03:34.400 --> 03:38.200]  It makes great concentrates and it really does what I want in a plant overall.
[03:38.200 --> 03:42.760]  So it's got that lemon candy and I named it after myself, Lemon Jeffrey.
[03:43.040 --> 03:45.600]  At the time that everybody was naming strains after themselves,
[03:45.960 --> 03:48.520]  Arian had a strain, Scott had a strain.
[03:48.680 --> 03:50.080]  I wanted a strain.
[03:50.080 --> 03:52.520]  And instead of just doing a Jeff's OG or something like that,
[03:52.520 --> 03:54.560]  I went with the Lemon Jeffrey.
[03:54.560 --> 03:56.840]  So the Lemon Jeffrey is one of my top three favorites.
[03:56.840 --> 03:59.880]  Then on the same totem pole there or on that same pyramid,
[03:59.880 --> 04:04.040]  we have got the Arise. Arise is one of my favorites because
[04:04.760 --> 04:07.720]  I did exactly what I was trying to do with that cross.
[04:07.960 --> 04:11.400]  I thought, what if I take a really indica-dominant, wide leaf,
[04:12.240 --> 04:16.320]  shorter, stockier plant, and I cross it with this really skinny leaf?
[04:16.480 --> 04:21.800]  And the other, the male that I used was like gassy and cushy and feet smelling.
[04:21.880 --> 04:24.800]  And the female that I used was tropical and sweet.
[04:24.800 --> 04:26.880]  So I was like, what if I cross those two?
[04:26.920 --> 04:31.320]  It should make something completely in the middle that is totally unique.
[04:31.320 --> 04:33.040]  And it did exactly what I was trying to do.
[04:33.040 --> 04:35.640]  So, and it tested amazingly high.
[04:36.040 --> 04:39.800]  It's not rare to see Arise testing in the 27 to 30% area.
[04:39.960 --> 04:43.360]  So Arise tests super high and it tastes really good.
[04:43.360 --> 04:46.200]  And it's a beautiful blend of that indica sativa mix,
[04:46.400 --> 04:47.960]  which is kind of what I was trying to do there.
[04:47.960 --> 04:50.440]  So it worked out beautifully. Then the Grateful Dog.
[04:51.120 --> 04:54.280]  That was my first feminized project and it went well.
[04:54.680 --> 04:58.560]  And the aromas and flavors that came from that were just amazing.
[04:58.560 --> 05:01.120]  The colors that come from those plants were just amazing.
[05:01.480 --> 05:04.240]  And being my first feminized project that I worked with.
[05:04.240 --> 05:08.160]  And the first thing that when we were at a party and nobody had any herb but me
[05:08.160 --> 05:10.520]  and somebody's like, anybody got any weed? And I was like, sure,
[05:10.520 --> 05:12.640]  let's smoke some weed. And they're like, we got to go in the backyard.
[05:12.640 --> 05:15.600]  And I went in the backyard and I sat down on the steps to bust out my weed and
[05:15.600 --> 05:18.640]  put some in the pipe. And they're like, holy shit. As soon as I cracked it open,
[05:18.680 --> 05:22.440]  everybody at the party was like, damn, that smells so good. And it was,
[05:22.480 --> 05:23.320]  I felt the same way,
[05:23.320 --> 05:26.800]  but I didn't know it was that potent yet until I had taken it out in the public.
[05:27.120 --> 05:29.680]  And everybody in there in that area was a smoker.
[05:29.680 --> 05:33.400]  We'd all smoked plenty of herb and they all reacted heavily to the aroma and
[05:33.400 --> 05:35.800]  flavor and the potency of that Grateful Dog.
[05:35.800 --> 05:37.800]  So I knew I had something special there.
[05:38.120 --> 05:41.040]  There's a whole nother story that I'm going to share with you guys about
[05:41.040 --> 05:43.920]  Grateful Dog in the future, but that's a Grateful Dog episode.
[05:44.040 --> 05:45.360]  We're going to focus on Lemon Jeffrey.
[05:45.360 --> 05:49.680]  So the top three would be Lemon Jeffrey, Arise and the Grateful Dog.
[05:49.680 --> 05:53.720]  Now let's continue and let's talk about that lemony goodness.
[05:53.760 --> 05:55.680]  My namesake, Lemon Jeffrey.
[05:57.560 --> 06:00.600]  Lemon Jeffrey is only available in feminized seeds.
[06:00.600 --> 06:03.800]  Lemon Jeffrey is a cross of Lemon Skunk and Golden Goat.
[06:03.840 --> 06:06.680]  My Lemon Skunk is from greenhouse seeds.
[06:06.680 --> 06:09.560]  My Lemon Skunk plant is a beautiful plant.
[06:09.840 --> 06:14.400]  It produces super frosty buds that smell like lemon candy.
[06:14.720 --> 06:19.400]  And I always describe it as if you take a box of lemon heads and pour the
[06:19.400 --> 06:23.480]  candy out and then just smell the inside of the box, that sweet, soft,
[06:23.480 --> 06:27.560]  smooth lemon candy smell that's coming from my Lemon Skunk plant.
[06:27.560 --> 06:30.760]  I've had this Lemon Skunk for probably seven or eight years and I've
[06:30.760 --> 06:32.680]  used her in a lot of crosses.
[06:33.240 --> 06:38.440]  So she smells amazing, but this Lemon Skunk plant grows kind of tall, kind of
[06:38.440 --> 06:43.240]  stretchy, kind of extra branchy, and she doesn't put out enough yield for how
[06:43.240 --> 06:48.120]  much space she takes and she also flowers for too long, but she produces a lot of
[06:48.120 --> 06:51.800]  resin and she smells amazing and I love the way it smells.
[06:51.800 --> 06:53.520]  So I chose to breed with her.
[06:54.000 --> 06:56.520]  I chose to breed it to my Golden Goat.
[06:56.520 --> 06:57.800]  I have a Golden Goat female.
[06:57.800 --> 06:59.640]  Let's talk about Golden Goat for a little bit.
[06:59.960 --> 07:04.400]  Golden Goat is Island Sweet Skunk, Hawaiian Sativa, and Romulan.
[07:05.040 --> 07:10.800]  It is a tropical smelling Sativa dominant plant that doesn't get super tall.
[07:10.800 --> 07:13.720]  It stays short and stout because of the Romulan in there.
[07:14.000 --> 07:16.920]  If you don't give it enough light, it will stretch and get tall on you.
[07:16.920 --> 07:21.520]  But Golden Goat will stay short and stocky if you top it and give it plenty
[07:21.520 --> 07:23.160]  of light and room to spread out.
[07:23.160 --> 07:26.360]  If it doesn't have room to spread, it will go up, but if you have space for
[07:26.360 --> 07:27.640]  it to go out, it will go out.
[07:27.640 --> 07:30.320]  And if you teach it to go out, if you train it, it will spread.
[07:30.720 --> 07:33.840]  So Golden Goat likes to finish around eight weeks.
[07:33.840 --> 07:35.800]  You could let it go nine weeks if you really want.
[07:36.000 --> 07:38.920]  The Lemon Skunk on the other hand, that sucker could go 10 weeks.
[07:38.920 --> 07:42.560]  You could let it go longer if you wanted and it would really pack on the weight.
[07:43.040 --> 07:46.120]  But the Romulan in the Golden Goat side of things really keeps
[07:46.120 --> 07:47.360]  the flowering time down.
[07:47.600 --> 07:50.840]  So the Golden Goat has a tropical, delicious flavor.
[07:51.280 --> 07:55.120]  It's shorter, it's more stout, and it produces a lot of weight.
[07:55.120 --> 07:58.240]  Some of my heaviest harvests have come from Golden Goat.
[07:58.240 --> 08:02.200]  I used to run just lights of Golden Goat because I could just pull huge harvest.
[08:02.200 --> 08:06.560]  I could get almost three pounds per light under the old school single
[08:06.560 --> 08:07.880]  ended bulbs back in the day.
[08:08.200 --> 08:12.200]  When everybody else was striving for two, I was pulling 2.6 and three pounds of
[08:12.200 --> 08:15.840]  light with crops of Golden Goat in seven gallon pots.
[08:16.600 --> 08:17.720]  So those are the two parents.
[08:17.720 --> 08:18.640]  They're both females.
[08:18.640 --> 08:20.080]  We'll talk about that in a second.
[08:20.080 --> 08:26.360]  My goal in this cross was to take that Lemon Skunk smooth, sweet flavor and mix
[08:26.360 --> 08:31.480]  it with that tropical flavor of the Golden Goat while making more robust plants.
[08:31.480 --> 08:34.720]  I wanted to put some vigor and some beef into that Lemon Skunk.
[08:34.720 --> 08:38.680]  That Lemon Skunk is so dainty and skinny and it just takes off and grows straight
[08:38.680 --> 08:41.920]  up into the lights, but it doesn't produce a lot, but the aroma and the
[08:41.920 --> 08:44.840]  frost were so phenomenal that I just had to work with it.
[08:45.320 --> 08:50.000]  So I was trying to make my own feminized Golden Goat seeds because I had posted
[08:50.000 --> 08:54.560]  pictures of my Golden Goat crop and everybody went nuts and wanted Golden Goat seeds.
[08:54.680 --> 08:57.600]  So I was making Golden Goat feminized seeds.
[08:57.600 --> 09:01.480]  Now, when I make feminized seeds, I always think, why not put a couple other
[09:01.480 --> 09:05.000]  plants in here, do some thinking about it and make some unique feminized
[09:05.000 --> 09:06.080]  crosses while I'm at it.
[09:06.440 --> 09:09.200]  I knew that this Lemon Skunk and Golden Goat would pair well.
[09:09.440 --> 09:10.520]  I just knew it's something.
[09:10.800 --> 09:11.880]  It's like being a chef.
[09:11.880 --> 09:12.920]  It's like being an artist.
[09:12.920 --> 09:14.600]  It's like being a musician, being a breeder.
[09:14.640 --> 09:19.000]  Sometimes you just know, and I've noticed that a lot of great breeders are also
[09:19.000 --> 09:19.600]  chefs.
[09:20.000 --> 09:21.480]  There's just something with the palate.
[09:21.480 --> 09:24.680]  You just know that this and this are going to make something phenomenal.
[09:24.960 --> 09:27.400]  And I hit the nail right on the head with this one.
[09:27.760 --> 09:31.560]  So now let's talk about, I said earlier, both of these are females.
[09:31.760 --> 09:33.960]  The Lemon Skunk is a girl that came from a seed.
[09:34.000 --> 09:36.120]  The Golden Goat is a clone only.
[09:36.120 --> 09:40.280]  There's no male of the Golden Goat unless you get a back cross or unless
[09:40.280 --> 09:42.160]  you reverse it, which is what I did.
[09:42.720 --> 09:46.400]  I mixed my own solution of silver thiosulfate and I applied it at very
[09:46.400 --> 09:49.000]  specific rates and intervals and dilutions.
[09:49.360 --> 09:55.360]  And I turned my female Golden Goat plant into a male that produced pollen that
[09:55.440 --> 10:01.040]  only contained female chromosomes so that when I pollinated my female plant, all
[10:01.040 --> 10:04.200]  of the seeds that came out are only females.
[10:04.200 --> 10:06.120]  And that cross is the Lemon Jeffrey.
[10:06.120 --> 10:11.800]  That Lemon Skunk female crossed to the Golden Goat reversed male.
[10:12.280 --> 10:13.440]  Is the Lemon Jeffrey.
[10:13.440 --> 10:17.960]  And that would be known as a Lemon Jeffrey R1 because it is technically a reversal.
[10:18.200 --> 10:23.840]  You see a lot of packages that'll say, uh, whatever, a Rise F1, a Rise F2, or
[10:23.840 --> 10:29.160]  Golden Goat BX1, this is a Lemon Jeffrey R1.
[10:30.080 --> 10:30.320]  All right.
[10:30.320 --> 10:33.280]  That's enough about the background and parents of Lemon Jeffrey.
[10:33.280 --> 10:36.400]  Let's talk more about the plants themselves.
[10:36.960 --> 10:40.600]  You won't see a lot of morphology or different phenotypes from the Lemon
[10:40.640 --> 10:41.040]  Jeffrey.
[10:41.360 --> 10:45.440]  It's basically that perfect 50, 50 mix of Lemon Skunk and Golden Goat.
[10:45.840 --> 10:48.360]  The plants grow like those short stout Christmas trees.
[10:48.360 --> 10:52.680]  And if you cut the top off the lower branches meet up at the top, nice and
[10:52.680 --> 10:56.640]  even to make a very beautiful, nice canopy, you can leave that top glory bud
[10:56.800 --> 10:59.080]  and it will produce a giant bud up there at the top.
[10:59.080 --> 11:02.720]  But if you cut that main top out and let all those bottoms catch up, you'll
[11:02.720 --> 11:05.240]  produce a big sea of beautiful colors.
[11:05.240 --> 11:08.480]  It'll produce nice long spears and it likes to be topped and it
[11:08.480 --> 11:10.320]  likes to be trained and spread out.
[11:10.640 --> 11:14.480]  So most of the phenotypes are going to have that Christmas tree sort of shape to them.
[11:14.480 --> 11:17.680]  They're going to be kind of branchy, but they're not going to have a super
[11:17.680 --> 11:19.320]  dominant top, that apical top.
[11:19.320 --> 11:23.760]  Isn't going to try to stretch way above the rest of the plants until late flower.
[11:23.760 --> 11:27.160]  It's going to turn into a giant bud, but through most of veg and early
[11:27.160 --> 11:30.080]  flower, it's not going to take off real tall, late in flower.
[11:30.120 --> 11:33.200]  That sucker is going to be a giant baseball bat up on the top there.
[11:33.480 --> 11:36.360]  But if you top that one, you'll get a whole bunch of arms just
[11:36.360 --> 11:37.800]  sticking up and there'll be huge.
[11:38.480 --> 11:40.400]  Now there will be a couple of weirdos in the mix.
[11:40.400 --> 11:44.560]  You'll see some weird leaves because that golden goat passes on some weird traits.
[11:45.160 --> 11:49.280]  But I've noticed in golden goat crosses, those super skinny leaves often have more
[11:49.280 --> 11:51.240]  THC, they've got more potency to them.
[11:51.240 --> 11:55.240]  The thinner the leaf, the more potent also, the longer they take to flower.
[11:55.960 --> 12:00.360]  So you may see some weirdness from the golden goat in some very rare phenotypes.
[12:00.360 --> 12:04.400]  You may also see phenotypes that produce extra nodes and extra branching.
[12:04.640 --> 12:06.240]  I really like those phenotypes.
[12:06.240 --> 12:09.280]  Those are great for commercial production because I feel like more nodes and more
[12:09.320 --> 12:12.120]  branching is room for more production.
[12:12.120 --> 12:14.040]  You'll see what I'm talking about when that pops up.
[12:14.320 --> 12:16.080]  That is a good sign if you see that.
[12:16.320 --> 12:20.320]  I describe it as most plants put off nodes at the north, south, east, and west
[12:20.320 --> 12:25.200]  positions. Sometimes golden goat crosses will throw out a fifth and sixth set of
[12:25.200 --> 12:29.600]  branches. So instead of just a cross up the stem, up the meristem, you've got more
[12:29.840 --> 12:34.120]  of a spiral happening, like a spiral staircase of branches, and it gives you the
[12:34.120 --> 12:36.480]  opportunity for more production.
[12:36.520 --> 12:40.320]  So those are the basic phenotypical traits of the lemon jeffery.
[12:40.480 --> 12:45.520]  It's mainly a 50-50 mix of the lemon skunk mom and the golden goat dad.
[12:45.720 --> 12:50.440]  Being a feminized cross, there's not a lot of room for a whole bunch of variation in
[12:50.440 --> 12:56.240]  there. However, I did mention there will be some mutants from the golden goat
[12:56.560 --> 12:59.960]  background. Now let's talk about the height of lemon jeffery.
[12:59.960 --> 13:03.720]  Lemon jeffery will be fairly tall at the end of flower, but you will have giant
[13:03.720 --> 13:09.960]  buds. If you're not using any trellising or sticks or netting of some sort, it's got
[13:09.960 --> 13:14.840]  the opportunity and the potential to double in size through the flowering cycle.
[13:14.840 --> 13:16.360]  So be prepared for tall plants.
[13:16.360 --> 13:21.040]  Maybe flower early if you're not going to use a trellis or a scrog or tie these
[13:21.040 --> 13:22.560]  plants down in some way.
[13:22.560 --> 13:26.160]  Also, if you're going to have that giant glory bud in there, you're going to need
[13:26.160 --> 13:28.040]  to flower early because they're going to get tall.
[13:28.040 --> 13:32.280]  That middle bud is going to get huge if you don't cut that main top out.
[13:32.280 --> 13:36.480]  So the plants will get fairly tall with moderate stretch in flower.
[13:36.480 --> 13:39.640]  They will stretch on you if you don't take that main top out.
[13:40.080 --> 13:42.000]  I recommend spreading the branches out.
[13:42.160 --> 13:45.600]  If you're just using individual pots, put a bunch of sticks in there around the
[13:45.600 --> 13:49.640]  perimeter of the pot, put them outward and then just spread those branches out so that
[13:49.640 --> 13:51.080]  the whole plant gets a lot of light.
[13:51.080 --> 13:56.200]  Clean up the bottom quite a bit and let those long arms develop long, giant spear buds.
[13:56.400 --> 14:01.000]  So if you don't have some sort of trellis or a tomato cage, use some sticks and spread
[14:01.000 --> 14:02.800]  out the plants real wide.
[14:03.160 --> 14:06.640]  Lemon Jeffrey can cover some distance and it likes a lot of light.
[14:06.640 --> 14:09.440]  The more light you give it, the happier it will be.
[14:10.520 --> 14:15.200]  If you take care of Lemon Jeffrey, you should get fairly generous yields.
[14:15.200 --> 14:17.880]  I can get huge harvest off of it in three gallon pots.
[14:17.880 --> 14:19.960]  I can get huge harvest in seven gallon pots.
[14:19.960 --> 14:21.280]  I've ran it in private grows.
[14:21.480 --> 14:22.600]  I've ran it in home grows.
[14:22.600 --> 14:23.840]  I've ran it in commercial grows.
[14:23.840 --> 14:24.600]  I've bred with it.
[14:24.920 --> 14:27.720]  This plant puts out generous harvest.
[14:27.840 --> 14:32.160]  Even if you're a beginner grower, you should be able to get great harvest off of this plant.
[14:33.080 --> 14:37.680]  Now being a sativa dominant hybrid, I would recommend letting this plant go around 70 days.
[14:37.960 --> 14:39.680]  It may be ready around 63.
[14:39.920 --> 14:43.960]  I would recommend closer to 70 days, you will have better results.
[14:44.480 --> 14:46.040]  Of course, that's up to your schedule.
[14:46.040 --> 14:47.120]  It's up to your nutrients.
[14:47.120 --> 14:48.360]  It's up to your environment.
[14:48.600 --> 14:49.800]  It's up to your lights.
[14:50.280 --> 14:51.800]  Everything will make a difference there.
[14:51.800 --> 14:54.680]  But 63 to 70 days is what I would recommend.
[14:55.400 --> 14:59.240]  Be patient because right at the end there, they may pack on a little extra weight.
[14:59.240 --> 15:03.880]  The Lemon Jeffrey may bulk up for you, get a little chunkier right at the end of flower.
[15:04.440 --> 15:08.200]  And also she looks so pretty right at the end of flower when you're flushing her out and she starts
[15:08.200 --> 15:11.800]  getting all chunky and those, the ends of the leaves just start turning yellow and they start to
[15:11.800 --> 15:13.680]  curl down because that's what she does at the end.
[15:13.920 --> 15:18.400]  The leaves get long and they just curl down toward the end and they get real pale and those buds are
[15:18.400 --> 15:19.520]  giant and bright green.
[15:19.520 --> 15:22.040]  It just looks so pretty at the end if you let it go 10 weeks.
[15:22.920 --> 15:26.400]  So 63, 70 days, that's what I would recommend for flowering time.
[15:26.960 --> 15:29.400]  Let's talk a little bit about feeding Lemon Jeffrey.
[15:29.400 --> 15:33.760]  I have fed the crap out of this plant and she seems to be able to take a feeding.
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.480]  Although all of my feeds are very well balanced.
[15:36.480 --> 15:42.200]  I do go high in PPMs, but I'm not overdoing any one particular nutrient.
[15:42.200 --> 15:46.080]  But in my experience, Lemon Jeffrey can take a heavy feeding.
[15:46.320 --> 15:51.160]  And I would start off feeding her strong because like I said, she goes 70 days and she'll need some
[15:51.160 --> 15:53.880]  nutrients for the end. So make sure you get her fired up in the beginning.
[15:54.400 --> 16:00.400]  Our plants uptake about 90% of their nitrogen during the vegetative phase.
[16:00.480 --> 16:06.480]  So make sure you're feeding your plants plenty of nitrogen in the vegetative phase before flower to
[16:06.480 --> 16:08.320]  give them plenty of energy.
[16:08.320 --> 16:11.440]  You want to get that plant ready to go.
[16:11.480 --> 16:12.600]  Don't OD your plants.
[16:12.600 --> 16:15.920]  Don't think, well, Rasta Jeff said to feed them a lot, so I need to go in there and fucking slam
[16:15.920 --> 16:18.680]  them, but make sure they're getting fed appropriately.
[16:19.280 --> 16:24.920]  At least make sure you're giving them enough NPNK and maybe some CalMag and then definitely take
[16:24.920 --> 16:25.680]  care of the roots.
[16:25.720 --> 16:30.080]  Put something in there for the roots, some sort of root inoculant, some sort of microbial, some
[16:30.080 --> 16:31.040]  sort of root booster.
[16:31.040 --> 16:33.240]  You want something that works on the roots for your plants.
[16:33.600 --> 16:35.680]  That's what I recommend as a bare minimum.
[16:36.360 --> 16:41.040]  But make sure your plants are healthy before they go into the flower phase, especially with a
[16:41.040 --> 16:43.400]  longer flowering plant like the Lemon Jeffrey.
[16:43.400 --> 16:44.640]  It's going to take 70 days.
[16:44.800 --> 16:46.720]  You want it to have plenty of nitrogen.
[16:46.720 --> 16:47.880]  You don't want to be chasing it.
[16:48.080 --> 16:52.560]  You'll see around week three, four, maybe week five, it starts fading already and you're feeding it
[16:52.560 --> 16:52.840]  right.
[16:52.840 --> 16:53.680]  But you're like, what the shit?
[16:53.680 --> 16:55.000]  It looks like I've got a deficiency.
[16:55.000 --> 16:58.080]  It's because it just went nitrogen deficient on you because it took off.
[16:58.080 --> 16:58.920]  You weren't prepared.
[16:59.160 --> 17:03.800]  You weren't giving it enough nitrogen late in flower or late in veg and possibly early in
[17:03.800 --> 17:04.320]  flower.
[17:04.920 --> 17:08.600]  So feed your plants and Lemon Jeffrey can take a lot of feeding is my point to that rant.
[17:08.600 --> 17:11.480]  Also make sure your pH is on point.
[17:11.480 --> 17:18.280]  Lemon Jeffrey, in my experience, likes to be somewhere between 6.2 and 6.4 in cocoa or soil.
[17:18.640 --> 17:21.720]  So when you mix up your nutrients, get everything all mixed up the way you need it.
[17:22.040 --> 17:24.400]  Then get your pH pen, see what the pH is.
[17:24.560 --> 17:26.160]  Use your pH up or pH down.
[17:26.160 --> 17:30.400]  Put a few drops in there until you get it somewhere between 6.2 and 6.4.
[17:30.400 --> 17:34.320]  That's where those plants are going to want that solutions where they're going to react the best
[17:34.320 --> 17:34.640]  for you.
[17:34.640 --> 17:38.880]  They're going to go crazy when you get it dialed in, pay attention to them and write it down,
[17:39.120 --> 17:41.200]  write down the pH and then pay attention to how they grew.
[17:41.200 --> 17:44.880]  And then the next time, maybe if you went 6.2 this time, write it down and see how the plants
[17:44.880 --> 17:45.400]  reacted.
[17:45.640 --> 17:50.280]  The next time, adjust your solution to 6.4 and water the plants and write down 6.4 and see how
[17:50.280 --> 17:51.040]  the plants react.
[17:51.040 --> 17:55.360]  If they go, if they, if you can see a difference, stick with what worked better, right?
[17:55.400 --> 17:57.880]  Obviously it's trial and error when you're learning with cannabis.
[17:58.080 --> 17:59.960]  Anyway, make sure you get the pH correct.
[17:59.960 --> 18:02.040]  Make sure you get the feed dialed in.
[18:02.560 --> 18:06.920]  Then for sure, God, I sound like Brendan Chobb for sure.
[18:07.080 --> 18:09.920]  Make sure you flush the shit out of your Lemon Jeffrey plants.
[18:10.240 --> 18:13.960]  This strain is known for its delicious lemon candy flavor.
[18:13.960 --> 18:19.440]  Let's not ruin that by failing to flush our plants at the end and making it taste like burnt ash
[18:19.440 --> 18:20.400]  or something funky.
[18:20.640 --> 18:23.000]  Like how much molasses did you put in here at the end?
[18:23.120 --> 18:23.880]  Some shit like that.
[18:23.880 --> 18:25.720]  How much worm castings was in this mix?
[18:25.920 --> 18:27.080]  I don't want anybody to say that.
[18:27.080 --> 18:28.840]  How much cow mag did you feed these plants?
[18:28.840 --> 18:29.480]  You don't want that.
[18:29.480 --> 18:30.440]  Make sure you flush it.
[18:30.720 --> 18:35.480]  You want it to taste like sweet lemon candies, not like botanic care at the end of the
[18:35.480 --> 18:36.040]  harvest.
[18:36.960 --> 18:41.880]  So that sounds like a good way to segue into the flavors and aromas of Lemon Jeffrey.
[18:42.160 --> 18:46.320]  I know I say it a lot, but I think it smells and tastes like if you took a box of lemon
[18:46.320 --> 18:49.960]  heads and you poured those lemon heads on the table and you just smelled the inside of the
[18:49.960 --> 18:50.280]  box.
[18:50.280 --> 18:55.400]  If you squeeze it, that soft lemon head, lemon sorbet kind of candy smell that comes out.
[18:55.720 --> 18:58.720]  It's also sort of like country time lemonade powder.
[18:58.720 --> 19:02.840]  If you take the country time lemonade powder and you pop it open and just stick your head
[19:02.840 --> 19:04.720]  in there and give it a light smell, don't inhale too hard.
[19:04.720 --> 19:06.880]  You don't want to snort up any of that shit that's going to burn.
[19:07.160 --> 19:09.880]  But when you smell that country time lemonade powder, that's kind of what the Lemon
[19:09.880 --> 19:10.760]  Jeffrey smells like.
[19:11.080 --> 19:16.840]  Or also maybe a lemon car air freshener or also some of that lemon lime Gatorade powder.
[19:16.840 --> 19:19.320]  And maybe it's got a hint of sweet tarts in there.
[19:19.320 --> 19:23.320]  It's got that aftertaste, that after aroma of sweet tarts.
[19:23.320 --> 19:27.000]  That's usually the flavors that I experience with Lemon Jeffrey.
[19:27.720 --> 19:31.200]  Now let's talk a little bit about the effects of Lemon Jeffrey.
[19:32.040 --> 19:37.880]  I really prefer like a sativa heavy high THC lemon lime flavored kind of a strain for my
[19:37.880 --> 19:38.960]  daytime smoke.
[19:39.240 --> 19:43.320]  Some people may find Lemon Jeffrey to be too potent.
[19:43.360 --> 19:45.840]  It tests in the high 20s consistently.
[19:46.040 --> 19:47.160]  24 to 28.
[19:47.160 --> 19:50.520]  I've seen 28% THCA.
[19:51.160 --> 19:53.080]  Sometimes that's too much for people.
[19:53.800 --> 19:54.720]  I think it's great.
[19:55.240 --> 19:59.480]  It makes me feel euphoric and talkative and energized.
[19:59.920 --> 20:02.320]  Some people, it makes them a little anxious.
[20:03.000 --> 20:06.960]  I've noticed that the people that are already going kind of fast, the people that are real
[20:06.960 --> 20:11.160]  talkative and that have a lot of thoughts and have a lot to say and are always thinking a
[20:11.160 --> 20:11.480]  lot.
[20:11.840 --> 20:16.480]  I feel like the strains with Limonene, things like Lemon Jeffrey and Lemon Skunk, I feel
[20:16.480 --> 20:19.440]  like those strains sort of even those people out.
[20:19.520 --> 20:21.320]  It balances their conversation.
[20:21.320 --> 20:23.480]  It slows them down and it puts them more in a focus thing.
[20:23.480 --> 20:27.280]  Instead of just being in a spin, it kind of gives them a target and they can kind of quit
[20:27.520 --> 20:31.360]  talking at everybody and kind of look at a person and talk to a person.
[20:31.680 --> 20:35.360]  I think that the Lemon Jeffrey and the Lemon Skunk kind of do that.
[20:35.760 --> 20:40.800]  But that's just for that fast minded, talkative kind of a person with that creative,
[20:41.120 --> 20:42.680]  just nonstop kind of a mind.
[20:42.680 --> 20:46.360]  People that don't consume a lot of cannabis and people that are already kind of quiet,
[20:46.920 --> 20:48.800]  people that can get jittery and anxious.
[20:48.960 --> 20:52.440]  Sometimes the Lemon Jeffrey may kind of give you a little bit of the sweats and a little
[20:52.440 --> 20:55.120]  bit of the nerves because it is a quite potent strain.
[20:55.760 --> 20:57.800]  For me, it's a beautiful morning smoke.
[20:57.800 --> 20:59.560]  I love that lemon flavor in the morning.
[20:59.560 --> 21:00.680]  It wakes my brain up.
[21:00.880 --> 21:02.400]  It puts all the pieces of my puzzle.
[21:02.560 --> 21:04.720]  I feel like overnight my brain just fell apart.
[21:04.720 --> 21:06.000]  The puzzle pieces went everywhere.
[21:06.000 --> 21:09.800]  I feel like the Lemon Jeffrey just puts the puzzle pieces right back together for me.
[21:10.400 --> 21:13.080]  So for me, Lemon Jeffrey puts me right in that sweet spot.
[21:13.160 --> 21:15.600]  For other people, it could be too much.
[21:15.760 --> 21:17.520]  It could make you super giggly.
[21:17.560 --> 21:19.400]  It could make you super paranoid.
[21:19.560 --> 21:22.360]  It will definitely make you talkative and energetic.
[21:22.600 --> 21:25.600]  So let's talk about some of the medical effects of Lemon Jeffrey.
[21:25.840 --> 21:26.880]  I am not a doctor.
[21:26.880 --> 21:29.160]  I am reading these effects off of Leafly.
[21:29.440 --> 21:35.080]  So the effects that have been reported to Leafly about Lemon Jeffrey are it's good to
[21:35.080 --> 21:41.760]  relieve stress, which I believe because limonene, the terpene found in Lemon Jeffrey,
[21:42.480 --> 21:44.760]  has definitely been linked to stress relief.
[21:44.760 --> 21:49.120]  They are actually doing scientific research on terpenoids and limonene has been proven
[21:49.400 --> 21:51.080]  to help with stress relief.
[21:51.080 --> 21:53.120]  So that definitely is believable.
[21:53.440 --> 21:55.280]  The next thing on the list is depression.
[21:55.280 --> 21:57.760]  Of course, if you're not as stressed, you're not as depressed.
[21:57.760 --> 22:00.400]  And if you're giggling and smiling, you don't feel depression.
[22:00.400 --> 22:05.400]  So I believe that Lemon Jeffrey could help ease the effects of your depression.
[22:05.600 --> 22:07.200]  Also, it says here headaches.
[22:07.240 --> 22:10.880]  I know for sure that golden goat crosses will help with migraines.
[22:10.880 --> 22:12.600]  I've seen it work on multiple people.
[22:12.760 --> 22:16.680]  So it says here that Lemon Jeffrey will help with your headaches.
[22:16.680 --> 22:17.960]  I completely believe that.
[22:17.960 --> 22:24.880]  Also, Lemon Jeffrey has been known to help prevent seizures in folks with epilepsy.
[22:24.880 --> 22:27.680]  So that is a great medical quality of the Lemon Jeffrey.
[22:27.680 --> 22:28.680]  Again, I am not a doctor.
[22:28.680 --> 22:32.720]  These are just things that have been reported by consumers and patients to Leafly.
[22:33.080 --> 22:35.080]  I am just sharing that information with you.
[22:35.160 --> 22:36.600]  Your experience may be different.
[22:36.600 --> 22:38.040]  That's my little disclaimer here.
[22:38.480 --> 22:40.920]  So those are some of the effects reported from Lemon Jeffrey.
[22:40.920 --> 22:43.600]  While I'm here on the Leafly website, let's read a couple of their reviews.
[22:43.600 --> 22:46.080]  I just saw they have a bunch of reviews on Lemon Jeffrey.
[22:46.280 --> 22:50.040]  The first one says Lemon Jeffrey is an awesome, energetic and chill mode strain.
[22:50.040 --> 22:53.560]  Depending on your mood, I'm speaking for serious smokers that can smoke and harness
[22:53.920 --> 22:56.280]  the effects of high THC levels.
[22:56.280 --> 22:57.120]  That's a great review.
[22:57.440 --> 22:58.840]  This one says great strain.
[22:59.040 --> 23:03.440]  This has been so helpful to start my day and helps my pain and keeps me focused
[23:03.440 --> 23:05.480]  and increases my appetite, which I need.
[23:05.960 --> 23:06.880]  Hey, that's a cool review.
[23:06.880 --> 23:08.160]  This one is the best though.
[23:08.160 --> 23:12.360]  This one says best strain I've ever tried made everything so uplifting.
[23:12.400 --> 23:15.640]  That's a really cool review to see on a strain that you read.
[23:15.640 --> 23:16.760]  So all those are from Leafly.
[23:16.760 --> 23:20.520]  Big shout out to our friends at Leafly.com for having Lemon Jeffrey up there.
[23:20.680 --> 23:24.160]  I'm hoping they will put Arise up there before too long.
[23:24.160 --> 23:26.440]  All right, you guys, that's a quick breakdown on the effects
[23:26.440 --> 23:27.800]  and flavors of Lemon Jeffrey.
[23:28.160 --> 23:30.080]  I think that covers most of the details.
[23:30.080 --> 23:33.480]  Let's talk about a little tips and tricks with Lemon Jeffrey.
[23:33.480 --> 23:35.880]  Lemon Jeffrey is great for concentrates.
[23:35.880 --> 23:40.720]  If you're trying to make BHO or rosin or full spectrum extracts, Lemon
[23:40.720 --> 23:43.280]  Jeffrey is a great strain for extraction.
[23:43.800 --> 23:48.080]  I'm looking at a lab test on my phone and I've got a concentrate test from a
[23:48.080 --> 23:50.440]  friend who I'm not sure if they want their name mentioned on the show.
[23:50.440 --> 23:51.240]  They know who they are.
[23:51.240 --> 23:52.600]  Shout out for the great work, bro.
[23:52.840 --> 24:02.040]  I've got a lab test that is showing 86.6 total cannabinoids with 75.4% THC.
[24:02.320 --> 24:07.440]  The terpene test is showing 3.46% terpenes and that is from a
[24:07.440 --> 24:09.560]  Lemon Jeffrey concentrate sample.
[24:10.040 --> 24:12.600]  So the Lemon Jeffrey makes wonderful concentrates.
[24:12.600 --> 24:13.920]  It always tastes super good.
[24:14.120 --> 24:15.680]  It always gives me an amazing high.
[24:15.680 --> 24:18.360]  The Lemon Jeffrey concentrates make my eyes jitter.
[24:18.360 --> 24:19.600]  They make my eyes jump up and down.
[24:19.600 --> 24:21.960]  Like remember when you were a kid and you used to ride the school bus and
[24:21.960 --> 24:24.540]  you'd lean your head on the window and your eyes would jump up and down a
[24:24.540 --> 24:26.440]  little bit and everything would move around real weird.
[24:26.640 --> 24:29.240]  That's kind of what it feels like when you first take your dab of Lemon Jeffrey,
[24:29.240 --> 24:32.400]  everything goes, and you got to grab the table and get your shit together.
[24:32.400 --> 24:33.240]  It's real nice.
[24:33.240 --> 24:34.240]  I really enjoy it.
[24:34.520 --> 24:35.960]  So it makes great concentrates.
[24:36.440 --> 24:40.600]  One great thing about Lemon Jeffrey is it takes heat very well.
[24:40.600 --> 24:44.480]  Lemon Jeffery is known to get kind of tall, so it's going to grow right toward
[24:44.480 --> 24:48.520]  those lights. It will take that light heat fairly well. I'm not saying put it
[24:48.520 --> 24:51.920]  up against the light, but if it gets too close and it gets kind of warm, it's not
[24:51.920 --> 24:56.440]  gonna get too crazy and get too mad on it. I feel like limonene is a heat
[24:56.440 --> 24:59.640]  reaction and a heat response. It's a stress response in the plants and I
[24:59.640 --> 25:03.000]  think if we stress it with light and heat a little bit, it will create a
[25:03.000 --> 25:06.640]  little more limonene in the plants. Have you noticed if you put your plants too
[25:06.640 --> 25:09.840]  close to the light, sometimes they'll taste lemony even if they're not a lemon
[25:09.840 --> 25:14.480]  strain? Well, if you do it with a lemony strain, it will even more lemon it. So
[25:14.480 --> 25:18.240]  they take the heat fairly well. They are kind of a sativa dominant, so they're
[25:18.240 --> 25:21.840]  not super tight. They don't have gigantic leaves, so you're not running a lot of
[25:21.840 --> 25:26.200]  problems in that higher heat. They can take it. Also, I have never seen powdery
[25:26.200 --> 25:29.840]  mildew on a Lemon Jeffery plant before. So those are a few tips. Those are a few
[25:29.840 --> 25:33.680]  pointers with the Lemon Jeffery. Run it for concentrates. Run it for flowers. Make
[25:33.680 --> 25:38.640]  sure you take pictures and make sure you flush it so that you get that delicious
[25:38.640 --> 25:42.640]  lemon candy flavor. Alright you guys, that's all I've got for you about Lemon
[25:42.640 --> 25:45.640]  Jeffery. Thanks for hanging out. Thanks for listening to me ramble about one of
