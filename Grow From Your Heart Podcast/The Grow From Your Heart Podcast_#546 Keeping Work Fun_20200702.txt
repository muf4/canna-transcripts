[00:49.970 --> 00:54.070]  You know, I like to start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking today.
[00:54.070 --> 00:58.410]  I've been taking dabs of headbanger live batter from green dot labs.
[00:58.410 --> 01:03.210]  This is a blend of sour diesel, IBL and biker cush on the package.
[01:03.210 --> 01:06.410]  The flavor is described as sour and fuel.
[01:06.410 --> 01:09.310]  They should have followed that up with fucking delightful.
[01:09.310 --> 01:12.070]  I love the flavor of this concentrate.
[01:12.070 --> 01:14.590]  The sour, the fuel, it is perfect.
[01:14.590 --> 01:16.450]  It's funky, it's delicious.
[01:16.450 --> 01:20.230]  And when I dab it, I get goofy high from this concentrate.
[01:20.230 --> 01:23.330]  I'm going to crack the jar open and let you see what it looks like.
[01:23.330 --> 01:25.210]  That was the four gram jar of batter.
[01:25.210 --> 01:26.810]  I've worked my way about halfway through.
[01:26.810 --> 01:31.070]  You can see that's a beautiful golden texture, nice and smooth, beautiful color.
[01:31.070 --> 01:36.050]  I really enjoy the live batter from our friends at green dot labs on the back of the package.
[01:36.050 --> 01:44.170]  It does say the product contains 63.97% total THC and non detectable CBD.
[01:44.170 --> 01:49.210]  Once again, big shout out to our friends at green dot labs for the delicious and tremendous
[01:49.210 --> 01:51.130]  headbanger live batter.
[01:51.130 --> 01:55.830]  All right, podcast world, I do have a fun show lined up for you.
[01:55.850 --> 02:00.670]  Before we get there, let's do some shout outs to a few of our friends on Patreon.
[02:00.670 --> 02:05.550]  I do need to remind you that they have started adding taxes to Patreon.
[02:05.550 --> 02:09.510]  I don't think any of the things I offer on Patreon are taxable.
[02:09.510 --> 02:14.030]  Since all of the things I give you as Patreon tiers as rewards are virtual, they're all
[02:14.030 --> 02:16.750]  like thank yous and shout outs and I read your question.
[02:16.750 --> 02:18.830]  I don't think those things will be taxable.
[02:18.830 --> 02:23.310]  It is based on your location, not my location is based on where you are.
[02:23.310 --> 02:27.430]  When you contribute to Patreon, I tried to adjust all of the tiers to keep things tax
[02:27.430 --> 02:28.430]  free.
[02:28.430 --> 02:29.830]  I also have to be honest and legal.
[02:29.830 --> 02:32.870]  I did my best to keep it the same for everybody.
[02:32.870 --> 02:35.710]  I did, however, increase the price of a few tiers.
[02:35.710 --> 02:37.830]  I did talk about this on a previous episode.
[02:37.830 --> 02:41.670]  I just want to talk about it again because this will take effect by the time this episode
[02:41.670 --> 02:43.370]  comes out.
[02:43.370 --> 02:46.110]  There are new tiers on Patreon.
[02:46.110 --> 02:47.350]  I moved everything up.
[02:47.350 --> 02:51.510]  I was getting, I make promises that if you contribute to my Patreon, I will do things
[02:51.870 --> 02:53.270]  for you to say thank you.
[02:53.270 --> 02:54.630]  I was getting overwhelmed.
[02:54.630 --> 02:55.630]  I'm not complaining.
[02:55.630 --> 02:56.630]  I love the support.
[02:56.630 --> 03:00.830]  I love the contributions, but I wasn't able to keep up with my end of the agreement.
[03:00.830 --> 03:01.830]  People were contributing.
[03:01.830 --> 03:04.310]  They were not getting their shout outs and their questions read.
[03:04.310 --> 03:06.270]  To slow that down, I raised the prices.
[03:06.270 --> 03:09.390]  Normally, when you raise prices, you sell less of something.
[03:09.390 --> 03:11.230]  Hopefully, you guys just continue.
[03:11.230 --> 03:13.390]  You keep sending me the extra funds.
[03:13.390 --> 03:15.590]  That will result in me doing extra podcasts.
[03:15.590 --> 03:20.550]  I'm already trying to find scheduling time and energy to do another show every week.
[03:20.590 --> 03:24.110]  There will be some changes in the Patreon and there may be changes coming up in the
[03:24.110 --> 03:28.550]  podcast if the Patreon continues to kick ass the way that it has been.
[03:28.550 --> 03:31.070]  Thank you guys for the kick ass Patreon contributions.
[03:31.070 --> 03:32.670]  I am stoned and rambly.
[03:32.670 --> 03:36.790]  Once again, shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious Headbanger Live
[03:36.790 --> 03:37.790]  Batter.
[03:37.790 --> 03:38.790]  It's fucking working.
[03:38.790 --> 03:39.790]  All right.
[03:39.790 --> 03:41.790]  Now, here's the part where we are going to do some shout outs.
[03:41.790 --> 03:44.190]  I have invented a new club, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:44.190 --> 03:45.550]  This is the 710 Club.
[03:45.550 --> 03:50.510]  The following folks have contributed $7.10 as a monthly contribution to the Patreon.
[03:51.470 --> 03:53.550]  Welcome to the 710 Club.
[03:53.550 --> 03:55.510]  Ladies and gentlemen, let's give some shout outs.
[03:55.510 --> 03:58.510]  The leader of the 710 Club gets a shout out first.
[03:58.510 --> 04:00.710]  Let's give a giant shout out to my buddy Lemur Priest.
[04:00.710 --> 04:02.230]  Thank you for all of the support, bro.
[04:02.230 --> 04:03.310]  I do appreciate it.
[04:03.310 --> 04:04.830]  That does not go unnoticed.
[04:04.830 --> 04:05.830]  Thank you.
[04:05.830 --> 04:06.830]  Fist bump.
[04:06.830 --> 04:07.830]  Big respect.
[04:07.830 --> 04:08.830]  I appreciate that.
[04:08.830 --> 04:11.590]  Then, we need to follow that up with a big giant dab and a high five and a thank you
[04:11.590 --> 04:13.310]  for my friend, Popperoni.
[04:13.310 --> 04:16.430]  Then we need a big thank you shout out for my buddy, Godfather Kush.
[04:16.430 --> 04:21.270]  Then we need a big thank you shout out and a high five for EZ057420.
[04:21.270 --> 04:26.030]  Then I want to follow that up with a giant thank you shout out to my friend, Blackbird76.
[04:26.030 --> 04:29.950]  I've always got a thank you shout out and a high five for my buddy, Fat Rabbit.
[04:29.950 --> 04:33.070]  Let's send a giant thank you shout out to my buddy, Lefty's Farm.
[04:33.070 --> 04:34.630]  Thanks for all the support, Lefty.
[04:34.630 --> 04:37.430]  Also want to send a giant thank you to my buddy, Kes Burton.
[04:37.430 --> 04:38.430]  Hey, bro.
[04:38.430 --> 04:40.590]  Thank you for all the work you're doing with cannabis.
[04:40.590 --> 04:44.070]  You're learning a lot, but you are also teaching a lot, and that means a lot to me.
[04:44.070 --> 04:45.710]  Thanks for sharing the knowledge.
[04:45.750 --> 04:48.910]  I also want to give a giant thank you shout out to my friend, Rasta K.
[04:48.910 --> 04:49.910]  Big fist bump.
[04:49.910 --> 04:51.790]  Big thank you for all of the continued support.
[04:51.790 --> 04:55.230]  If you have more Grow questions, please send those my way, Rasta K.
[04:55.230 --> 04:57.110]  I'm more than delighted to help you out.
[04:57.110 --> 04:59.870]  Also, let's send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[04:59.870 --> 05:00.870]  Thank you.
[05:00.870 --> 05:02.270]  Shout out to our friend, Grow Man Stan.
[05:02.270 --> 05:05.470]  Also, we need to send a big thank you shout out to Xoso J.
[05:05.470 --> 05:11.230]  Xoso J, keeping up the awesome cannabis photography, running some of my genetics, doing wonderfully,
[05:11.230 --> 05:12.430]  posting beautiful photos.
[05:12.430 --> 05:13.430]  Thank you.
[05:13.550 --> 05:17.750]  Last but certainly not least, I want to send a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast thank
[05:17.750 --> 05:22.830]  you shout out, and a fist bump, and a virtual dab to my friend, John K.
[05:22.830 --> 05:23.830]  Big thank you.
[05:23.830 --> 05:24.830]  Big shout out.
[05:24.830 --> 05:28.550]  Again, big thanks to everybody who is supporting the show on Patreon.
[05:28.550 --> 05:32.430]  I do appreciate the support, and I could not continue to do the show the way that I do
[05:32.430 --> 05:33.750]  it without you.
[05:33.750 --> 05:37.870]  If it continues to go the way it is, I will put out more content.
[05:37.870 --> 05:41.670]  Look forward to more content in the future, because I've got faith you guys are not going
[05:41.670 --> 05:43.230]  to stop.
[05:43.230 --> 05:44.670]  What is the next order of business?
[05:44.670 --> 05:47.830]  The next thing I should cover is musical submissions.
[05:47.830 --> 05:49.110]  I am not ignoring you.
[05:49.110 --> 05:50.750]  I get a lot of emails every day.
[05:50.750 --> 05:52.670]  I get a lot of questions every day.
[05:52.670 --> 05:57.510]  I focused a lot of my time on catching up on Patreon messages and questions.
[05:57.510 --> 06:01.190]  If you've been waiting for an email or a reply via Patreon, I should have caught up with
[06:01.190 --> 06:02.190]  you by now.
[06:02.190 --> 06:05.230]  If not, you are probably next.
[06:05.230 --> 06:08.950]  The emails and musical submissions are also being caught up.
[06:08.950 --> 06:11.910]  I've gotten a lot of great musical submissions, you guys.
[06:11.910 --> 06:12.910]  Good work.
[06:13.590 --> 06:16.590]  I'm aware that we're a little bit too much for an intro.
[06:16.590 --> 06:20.150]  Keep in mind, if you're sending me music, I've got to talk over it.
[06:20.150 --> 06:25.950]  It can't sound like trash cans and trash trucks, and it can't be dubstep, is what I think I'm
[06:25.950 --> 06:26.950]  trying to say.
[06:26.950 --> 06:29.430]  If it is dubstep, mellow it down in a part where I can talk.
[06:29.430 --> 06:31.310]  Don't make the robots battle all at once.
[06:31.310 --> 06:34.390]  I think dubstep sounds like the toaster in the microwave having a fight, but if that's
[06:34.390 --> 06:37.910]  what you're into, do your bad thing.
[06:37.910 --> 06:39.670]  I'm still reviewing the musical submissions.
[06:39.670 --> 06:42.030]  There are a couple that I really enjoy.
[06:42.150 --> 06:44.430]  A couple of guys really get my vibe.
[06:44.430 --> 06:46.110]  I've sent a couple of emails out.
[06:46.110 --> 06:49.110]  I asked for permission to play one on the show tonight, but it's a little bit late.
[06:49.110 --> 06:50.110]  It was spontaneous.
[06:50.110 --> 06:54.670]  When I do have permission to play the samples, and I know what is expected of me, and once
[06:54.670 --> 06:58.110]  we've worked some things out, I will debut some really cool music.
[06:58.110 --> 07:01.390]  There's some really cool digital music, some really cool live music that has been produced
[07:01.390 --> 07:02.750]  for the show.
[07:02.750 --> 07:08.630]  Even if I don't select the tracks as a permanent start-stop commercial type of track that I
[07:08.630 --> 07:12.470]  play on the show, it still may end up being played on the show at least once so that
[07:12.470 --> 07:14.830]  you guys can hear these people's hard work.
[07:14.830 --> 07:15.830]  People put some time into it.
[07:15.830 --> 07:16.830]  I make music myself.
[07:16.830 --> 07:17.830]  I know what it's like.
[07:17.830 --> 07:19.610]  I stay up all night long.
[07:19.610 --> 07:22.550]  You don't realize that the sun is coming up, and you've just got to get this fucking sound
[07:22.550 --> 07:23.550]  perfect.
[07:23.550 --> 07:26.310]  You need this one sound panned over to the left just a little bit more, then you've got
[07:26.310 --> 07:28.390]  to go hear it in the car and make sure it's right.
[07:28.390 --> 07:29.390]  I know what it takes.
[07:29.390 --> 07:35.150]  I appreciate all of you folks who have made and contributed music and tracks for the show.
[07:35.150 --> 07:36.870]  Also keep in mind, it's got to be an original.
[07:36.870 --> 07:38.330]  You can't just remake another song.
[07:39.030 --> 07:40.030]  You can't cut and paste other pieces.
[07:40.030 --> 07:41.030]  Thank you, guys.
[07:41.030 --> 07:45.050]  I'm reviewing it, and I will share some on the show when I've got permission.
[07:45.050 --> 07:48.570]  Once again, shout out to Green Dot because they got me rambly.
[07:48.570 --> 07:50.250]  Where else are we?
[07:50.250 --> 07:52.610]  We are charting in Jamaica.
[07:52.610 --> 07:53.610]  That's right.
[07:53.610 --> 07:58.250]  I get statistics from a couple of sources on the podcast.
[07:58.250 --> 08:02.810]  Right now, it's not called ... I can't say the wrong terms because they've changed it.
[08:02.810 --> 08:04.850]  An Apple podcast, is that the correct word?
[08:04.850 --> 08:06.210]  Yeah, you can't call it iTunes anymore.
[08:06.210 --> 08:07.770]  It's Apple podcast.
[08:07.770 --> 08:14.130]  In the Apple podcasting app in Jamaica, we are ranked very high in the education category.
[08:14.130 --> 08:19.450]  We keep moving up and down every couple of days, but we are ranking in the top 50 and
[08:19.450 --> 08:23.530]  top 25 in the education category in Jamaica.
[08:23.530 --> 08:25.170]  That means a lot to me.
[08:25.170 --> 08:27.090]  Big up to everybody on the island of Jamaica.
[08:27.090 --> 08:31.650]  Big up to all the ganja farmers, all the ganja learners, all the upcoming ganja growers,
[08:31.650 --> 08:36.890]  everybody out there on the island who is dedicated and involved in the legalization and the ganja
[08:36.890 --> 08:37.890]  movement.
[08:37.890 --> 08:38.890]  Big respect.
[08:38.890 --> 08:39.890]  Keep listening to the show.
[08:39.890 --> 08:44.290]  I would love to hear some emails if you folks out there in Jamaica have any questions.
[08:44.290 --> 08:47.050]  Anybody has any questions, but I want to hear from my Jamaican family.
[08:47.050 --> 08:51.570]  Send me some emails, some questions to growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[08:51.570 --> 08:56.330]  Of course, if anybody has a grow question, a cultivation question, a cannabis culture
[08:56.330 --> 08:59.610]  question, growfromyourheartathotmail.com is the way to reach me.
[08:59.610 --> 09:04.730]  Of course, Patreon puts you at the front of the line, patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[09:04.730 --> 09:07.290]  I don't think I even said that part when I did the Patreon rant.
[09:07.290 --> 09:11.090]  If you're not already supporting the podcast and you would like to learn how to do so,
[09:11.090 --> 09:14.210]  visit patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[09:14.210 --> 09:15.970]  That should pop up on the screen right there.
[09:15.970 --> 09:20.210]  Of course, I did put a link in the show notes for all of the stoned friends and for the
[09:20.210 --> 09:21.730]  people who have their hands full.
[09:21.730 --> 09:24.290]  If you're working, if you're driving, just wait till you get home.
[09:24.290 --> 09:25.290]  You can click on that link.
[09:25.290 --> 09:26.690]  It'll take you right to Patreon.
[09:26.690 --> 09:27.690]  You can support the show.
[09:27.690 --> 09:28.690]  All right.
[09:28.690 --> 09:31.970]  I think that puts us back in rhythm, back on track.
[09:31.970 --> 09:32.970]  Where are we?
[09:32.970 --> 09:33.970]  Garden updates.
[09:34.210 --> 09:35.570]  I like to update you guys on what is happening.
[09:35.570 --> 09:37.370]  You guys and gals and binary folk.
[09:37.370 --> 09:41.570]  I like to keep you updated on what is happening in my personal garden.
[09:41.570 --> 09:46.170]  Most of you know that I am running a Jack the Ripper mail to make a Jack the Ripper
[09:46.170 --> 09:47.170]  F2 experiment.
[09:47.170 --> 09:50.650]  Of course, I was heavily influenced by Subcool.
[09:50.650 --> 09:52.090]  Big up, big respect to Subcool.
[09:52.090 --> 09:53.090]  Rest in peace, bro.
[09:53.090 --> 09:55.650]  I wish you were still here because I've got some fucking questions.
[09:55.650 --> 09:56.770]  Subcool had a lot of answers.
[09:56.770 --> 09:59.570]  He was miles ahead of me in this industry.
[09:59.570 --> 10:03.410]  He was doing the same thing I'm doing, but he's faced a lot of the trials and tribulations
[10:03.410 --> 10:04.730]  and had a lot of the questions.
[10:04.730 --> 10:07.370]  He's got a lot of the fucking answers that I need right now.
[10:07.370 --> 10:12.330]  I wish Subby was around, but I have got a Jack the Ripper mail plant in a room.
[10:12.330 --> 10:15.770]  I have got four Jack the Ripper females in a room.
[10:15.770 --> 10:21.210]  I have narrowed down my selections to where I know which three Jack the Ripper females
[10:21.210 --> 10:22.410]  I'm going to keep.
[10:22.410 --> 10:23.410]  Maybe two.
[10:23.410 --> 10:24.410]  I've got a good idea.
[10:24.410 --> 10:25.410]  Numbers two and four.
[10:25.410 --> 10:28.490]  That doesn't make any difference to you, but when I grew them, I labeled them one through
[10:28.490 --> 10:30.210]  10.
[10:30.210 --> 10:32.490]  Number one happened to be the fucking best male.
[10:32.570 --> 10:33.770]  He was a stud from the beginning.
[10:33.770 --> 10:35.490]  I was like, that one right there, I like it.
[10:35.490 --> 10:36.490]  Labeled it number one.
[10:36.490 --> 10:37.490]  It's what I was looking for.
[10:37.490 --> 10:40.330]  This whole project was based on finding a JTR male.
[10:40.330 --> 10:43.770]  I labeled him number one, then I labeled the next plant number two, the next one number
[10:43.770 --> 10:46.710]  three, the next one number four, down the line up to 10.
[10:46.710 --> 10:50.230]  As they grew and looked shitty, I got rid of the not, not shitty, but not up to my standards
[10:50.230 --> 10:51.230]  for breeding.
[10:51.230 --> 10:53.050]  I eliminated the not keepers.
[10:53.050 --> 10:55.010]  I shunned the non-believers.
[10:55.010 --> 10:56.730]  Then I was left with five.
[10:56.730 --> 10:57.930]  There's a male and four girls.
[10:57.930 --> 10:59.730]  I think I've eliminated.
[10:59.730 --> 11:02.490]  Number five doesn't root well.
[11:02.490 --> 11:04.570]  I think two and four are the keepers.
[11:04.570 --> 11:07.730]  I think seven is the one that's questionable that might stick around.
[11:07.730 --> 11:08.730]  We'll grow it again.
[11:08.730 --> 11:11.410]  One, two, and four are the keepers.
[11:11.410 --> 11:12.410]  Those are the champs.
[11:12.410 --> 11:16.770]  I've got some Jack the Ripper males, some Jack the Ripper girls.
[11:16.770 --> 11:19.970]  The Jack the Ripper male has successfully pollinated.
[11:19.970 --> 11:23.470]  I said in a couple episodes ago, it looked like the pollination worked.
[11:23.470 --> 11:24.810]  That room is seeded.
[11:24.810 --> 11:25.810]  Those pistils are brown.
[11:25.810 --> 11:26.810]  They're crinkled up.
[11:26.810 --> 11:28.390]  The calyxes are stuffed with seeds.
[11:28.390 --> 11:29.870]  The plants look amazing.
[11:29.870 --> 11:31.710]  They're nice and pregnant.
[11:31.710 --> 11:32.710]  What have we pollinated?
[11:32.710 --> 11:36.710]  I've been hinting slowly on the show at the strains that I've got in there that are getting
[11:36.710 --> 11:39.150]  pollinated by the JTR.
[11:39.150 --> 11:43.550]  Of course, I think I have mentioned there is an Arise plant in that mix.
[11:43.550 --> 11:48.390]  Part of the idea of making the Jack the Ripper cross was to cross Subcool's plant to one
[11:48.390 --> 11:51.710]  of my popular plants, which of course would be the Arise.
[11:51.710 --> 11:52.750]  There's a female Arise.
[11:52.750 --> 11:55.350]  We will have Arise X Jack the Ripper.
[11:55.350 --> 11:57.950]  You always list the ladies first when you're listing genetics.
[11:58.510 --> 12:00.510]  I think it would be Arise X Jack the Ripper.
[12:00.510 --> 12:03.750]  Also, I put a Golden Goat female in there.
[12:03.750 --> 12:05.630]  We've talked about that previously on the show.
[12:05.630 --> 12:07.430]  People are sending me name suggestions.
[12:07.430 --> 12:08.750]  I'll reveal some of those on the show.
[12:08.750 --> 12:09.750]  I'll share some of those.
[12:09.750 --> 12:13.510]  I, of course, will reveal the names of these crosses on the show as well.
[12:13.510 --> 12:15.430]  There's a Golden Goat in there.
[12:15.430 --> 12:17.230]  Lots of great name suggestions in the comments.
[12:17.230 --> 12:18.230]  Thank you, guys.
[12:18.230 --> 12:20.750]  There is a Blueberry Cookies female in there.
[12:20.750 --> 12:25.110]  We will have Blueberry Cookies X the Jack the Ripper.
[12:25.150 --> 12:28.830]  I think with the Blueberry Cookies, we're going to get the Blueberry Cookies flavor
[12:28.830 --> 12:33.630]  and potency, but I think the Jack the Ripper is going to give it a more bubblegum sweetness.
[12:33.630 --> 12:37.390]  The Jack the Ripper that I have selected, the phenotypes I'm finding in the room have
[12:37.390 --> 12:41.630]  a bubblegum, strawberry sweetness, maybe a watermelon sort of a thing.
[12:41.630 --> 12:47.110]  I think out of the Blueberry Cookies, we're going to get strawberry, blueberry, Skittles-y.
[12:47.110 --> 12:48.990]  I smell Laffy Taffy when I think about it.
[12:48.990 --> 12:51.070]  My brain smells the pink and purple Laffy Taffy.
[12:51.070 --> 12:52.310]  That's what my brain thinks.
[12:52.310 --> 12:54.950]  I also put a Platinum Tangy in there.
[12:54.950 --> 12:56.470]  Platinum Tangy is a great plant.
[12:56.470 --> 13:00.750]  It's a very good breeder, but I've noticed all of its offspring are not major monster
[13:00.750 --> 13:01.750]  growers.
[13:01.750 --> 13:04.310]  I'm wondering if this Jack the Ripper will make it bigger.
[13:04.310 --> 13:05.550]  That's what I'm going for for there.
[13:05.550 --> 13:09.310]  There's a Platinum Tangy, there's Blueberry Cookies, there's Golden Goat, and of course,
[13:09.310 --> 13:10.630]  there is a Rise.
[13:10.630 --> 13:12.470]  There are a few more other ladies in there.
[13:12.470 --> 13:14.550]  I will reveal more of those as time goes on.
[13:14.550 --> 13:16.990]  There's no need to spill all of the beans on one show.
[13:16.990 --> 13:18.350]  I got to keep your attention.
[13:18.350 --> 13:20.550]  Got to keep you coming back for more somehow.
[13:20.550 --> 13:21.910]  That is a garden update.
[13:21.910 --> 13:27.150]  Of course, all of those plants are underneath a Cannon, underneath two Cannon LED lights
[13:27.150 --> 13:28.710]  and a 5x5 tent.
[13:28.710 --> 13:32.430]  I am loving the Cannon LEDs.
[13:32.430 --> 13:37.550]  After vegging one round under the Cannon LEDs, I went back to Keith and I bought three
[13:37.550 --> 13:38.550]  more.
[13:38.550 --> 13:40.390]  Now I've got five Cannons running.
[13:40.390 --> 13:46.590]  The entire veg space, my clone area, my mom area, is all Cannon LEDs.
[13:46.590 --> 13:51.870]  I'm going to finish this flower run in a small room with Cannons and see how I like the finish.
[13:51.870 --> 13:56.750]  I'm going to see if I approve with the seed production and the way that everything goes
[13:56.750 --> 13:57.750]  and grows.
[13:57.750 --> 13:59.550]  So far, we're halfway in and I'm fucking happy.
[13:59.550 --> 14:05.670]  So if that continues, I may, I probably will, replace all of the lights in my personal flowering
[14:05.670 --> 14:08.790]  space with Cannon LEDs.
[14:08.790 --> 14:13.190]  Or I'm going to try to be really patient and get to be a tester for some of his new shit
[14:13.190 --> 14:16.510]  because I heard there's new things coming down the pipeline.
[14:16.510 --> 14:17.830]  Probably not supposed to say that.
[14:17.830 --> 14:18.830]  Shout out Keith.
[14:18.830 --> 14:19.830]  Getting you some hype.
[14:20.390 --> 14:21.390]  All right.
[14:21.390 --> 14:23.110]  Where do we want to move forward from here?
[14:23.110 --> 14:29.470]  I think this is a good time to segue into the Patreon question for this episode.
[14:29.470 --> 14:31.710]  I've only got one email for this episode.
[14:31.710 --> 14:33.550]  I thought it was a really good question.
[14:33.550 --> 14:38.950]  It also works with another question that another podcaster and fellow grower asked me.
[14:38.950 --> 14:42.950]  So let's start with the email part that was sent in by a listener.
[14:42.950 --> 14:46.710]  Then I'll also add on the other part that my friend attached, and then I will get on
[14:46.710 --> 14:49.710]  a nice little ramble here about this topic.
[14:50.590 --> 14:53.190]  This one comes from a person.
[14:53.190 --> 14:54.190]  Let's see.
[14:54.190 --> 14:55.190]  They did not sign their name.
[14:55.190 --> 14:57.430]  I don't think they want their name said.
[14:57.430 --> 14:58.430]  Easy enough for me.
[14:58.430 --> 14:59.430]  Let's get to the point.
[14:59.430 --> 15:04.190]  It goes, hey, hey, just was high as hell and wondered if growing commercially has taken
[15:04.190 --> 15:06.350]  the fun out of growing for you.
[15:06.350 --> 15:07.870]  Bro, that's all for now.
[15:07.870 --> 15:11.430]  I'm waiting on my new Cannon to pop some orange gasm seeds.
[15:11.430 --> 15:12.430]  Take care.
[15:12.430 --> 15:13.430]  P.S.
[15:13.430 --> 15:14.430]  Here's my favorite part.
[15:14.430 --> 15:15.430]  P.S.
[15:15.430 --> 15:16.430]  Kombucha makes me poo.
[15:16.430 --> 15:17.590]  And that's how the news goes.
[15:17.590 --> 15:21.030]  They didn't sign their name, but I think this is a great question.
[15:21.030 --> 15:25.430]  They're asking if growing commercially has taken the fun out of growing for me.
[15:25.430 --> 15:28.310]  Then they also said they're waiting for their Cannon LED.
[15:28.310 --> 15:31.450]  So this person's got some cannons and some orange gasm seeds.
[15:31.450 --> 15:32.790]  You're going to have a good time with that.
[15:32.790 --> 15:35.110]  I've seen the orange gasms under cannons.
[15:35.110 --> 15:36.190]  They do very well.
[15:36.190 --> 15:39.670]  I think with that one cannon, you probably want to run about a three by three, maybe
[15:39.670 --> 15:42.350]  a four by four space at the most.
[15:42.350 --> 15:44.710]  Keep that light a little bit above that seedling.
[15:44.870 --> 15:48.070]  And as the seedling grows, get that light closer and closer.
[15:48.070 --> 15:49.070]  We're off topic.
[15:49.070 --> 15:52.030]  I'm just excited that you've got my genetics and a light grown by my friend or made by
[15:52.030 --> 15:53.030]  my friend.
[15:53.030 --> 15:56.430]  Now I recommend you get some new millennium nutrients and you do the trifecta, bro.
[15:56.430 --> 15:57.830]  You can't go wrong that way.
[15:57.830 --> 16:02.630]  Also, you need a PL grow minder unit in that tent to make sure everything's iry.
[16:02.630 --> 16:03.630]  Shit can't go wrong.
[16:03.630 --> 16:08.190]  If you got iry genetics, a PL minder unit, if you've got a cannon light and you've got
[16:08.190 --> 16:12.070]  some new millennium nutrients, you are setting yourself up for success.
[16:12.070 --> 16:15.750]  You have got the fucking Ferrari, the keys, the fast tires.
[16:15.750 --> 16:16.830]  You got cool paint.
[16:16.830 --> 16:17.990]  You're ready to shred it.
[16:17.990 --> 16:21.190]  Let's get my high ass back on track because there was a question here.
[16:21.190 --> 16:22.750]  Also kombucha makes me poo.
[16:22.750 --> 16:23.750]  That's a good thing, bro.
[16:23.750 --> 16:25.070]  You don't need that stuff sitting in there for too long.
[16:25.070 --> 16:26.590]  It probably needed to come out.
[16:26.590 --> 16:28.510]  It'll fix your guts right up.
[16:28.510 --> 16:33.910]  Now, has commercial growing taken the fun out of growing for me?
[16:33.910 --> 16:36.230]  No, because I won't let it.
[16:36.230 --> 16:37.910]  I live to have a good time.
[16:37.910 --> 16:39.910]  I look like a serious, I don't look like a serious dude.
[16:39.910 --> 16:41.110]  I got fucking dreadlocks to my knees.
[16:41.150 --> 16:42.550]  I got a scruffy beard today.
[16:42.550 --> 16:45.510]  I wear a backwards hat and I'm fucking 41 years old.
[16:45.510 --> 16:47.950]  I come across fairly serious.
[16:47.950 --> 16:49.150]  I get shit done.
[16:49.150 --> 16:50.150]  People can rely on me.
[16:50.150 --> 16:54.790]  I like to give the appearance, the presentation that people can rely on me.
[16:54.790 --> 16:55.910]  I can get shit done.
[16:55.910 --> 16:57.470]  That's what I like to give off.
[16:57.470 --> 17:02.070]  Even being a stoner with dreadlocks and whatever, I still like to give people confidence that
[17:02.070 --> 17:03.070]  I can get shit done.
[17:03.070 --> 17:08.070]  So I seem kind of serious, especially being in charge, being the boss, being whatever,
[17:08.070 --> 17:11.910]  the lead grower, the team leader, the cultivation director at a facility.
[17:11.910 --> 17:14.030]  It can become stressful.
[17:14.030 --> 17:15.870]  There are a lot of things to worry about.
[17:15.870 --> 17:19.670]  I am the person between upper management and the employees.
[17:19.670 --> 17:22.150]  So when the employees fuck up, I got to yell at them and it's hard.
[17:22.150 --> 17:23.150]  I don't like yelling at people.
[17:23.150 --> 17:24.150]  They're my friends.
[17:24.150 --> 17:25.350]  They're my buddies.
[17:25.350 --> 17:26.350]  We dab after work.
[17:26.350 --> 17:27.350]  We hang out and shit.
[17:27.350 --> 17:29.730]  But I also don't like getting yelled at by management.
[17:29.730 --> 17:34.390]  So it's a weird place to be.
[17:34.390 --> 17:37.150]  I don't like being the disciplinarian kind of person.
[17:38.030 --> 17:41.270]  I don't let it suck the fun out of it because we are there to have fun.
[17:41.270 --> 17:45.210]  I let the first person that shows up to the grow select the music for the day.
[17:45.210 --> 17:48.710]  So if you're the first grow tech there, you get to go in the back and you get to select
[17:48.710 --> 17:49.710]  music.
[17:49.710 --> 17:51.250]  If you're the first trimmer there, you get to go up front.
[17:51.250 --> 17:52.250]  You get to select music.
[17:52.250 --> 17:54.530]  There's a big divide between the two parts of the building.
[17:54.530 --> 17:56.270]  I can't hear trimmer music when I'm in the back.
[17:56.270 --> 17:58.670]  I can't hear grower music when I'm up toward the front.
[17:58.670 --> 18:01.690]  So the first person in each part gets to select music.
[18:01.690 --> 18:03.550]  That gives a person a little bit of groove.
[18:03.550 --> 18:04.550]  They're there.
[18:04.550 --> 18:05.550]  They're first.
[18:05.550 --> 18:06.550]  They're kicking ass.
[18:06.950 --> 18:07.950]  I put the music up loud.
[18:07.950 --> 18:08.950]  I don't care what you want to play.
[18:08.950 --> 18:11.910]  I'll give you like 45 minutes of whatever you want.
[18:11.910 --> 18:16.910]  If it's gangster rap, if it's hip hop, if it's fucking Swedish country folk death metal,
[18:16.910 --> 18:17.910]  I'm in.
[18:17.910 --> 18:19.990]  If that's what you want to hear and you were first, let's do it.
[18:19.990 --> 18:22.390]  But we're going to switch it up before break.
[18:22.390 --> 18:23.390]  We're going to change it.
[18:23.390 --> 18:25.630]  When we come back from break, it's definitely going to be different.
[18:25.630 --> 18:27.030]  When we go to break, we'll know.
[18:27.030 --> 18:28.550]  After we go take a dab or two, we'll come back.
[18:28.550 --> 18:30.490]  We'll know what to put on after that.
[18:30.490 --> 18:32.910]  But I don't let it suck the fun out of it.
[18:32.910 --> 18:34.990]  I walk through the grow.
[18:34.990 --> 18:38.070]  I make sure that all the guys, I assign tasks for multiple guys.
[18:38.070 --> 18:39.070]  I get them going.
[18:39.070 --> 18:40.150]  They're doing their thing.
[18:40.150 --> 18:43.590]  I know that this guy doesn't really enjoy doing this job.
[18:43.590 --> 18:47.190]  I'm going to walk by him every couple of minutes and tell him he looks fucking good doing his
[18:47.190 --> 18:48.670]  job.
[18:48.670 --> 18:49.790]  He knows I'm fucking with him.
[18:49.790 --> 18:52.550]  He knows I'm just fucking patronizing him, but it's fun.
[18:52.550 --> 18:53.550]  It keeps us.
[18:53.550 --> 18:57.790]  He knows he's doing a job that sucks, but the boss is acknowledging it.
[18:57.790 --> 18:59.150]  I go check on every guy.
[18:59.150 --> 19:00.790]  Say I've got five guys growing.
[19:00.790 --> 19:02.550]  I've got them all doing separate things.
[19:02.550 --> 19:03.990]  Maybe two guys are putting up trellis.
[19:03.990 --> 19:05.110]  One guy's doing transplants.
[19:05.110 --> 19:07.470]  One guy's cutting clones and one guy's doing some bullshit.
[19:07.470 --> 19:10.070]  I'll bounce through all the guys and make sure they're all doing something that they
[19:10.070 --> 19:11.070]  need to be doing.
[19:11.070 --> 19:12.070]  Make sure they don't need help.
[19:12.070 --> 19:13.070]  If they need help, I'll help them.
[19:13.070 --> 19:14.950]  If the guy's putting up trellis, I'm six five.
[19:14.950 --> 19:18.470]  If they need a guy to go run fucking zip ties down the poles, I'll zip tie the shit out
[19:18.470 --> 19:19.470]  of it.
[19:19.470 --> 19:20.470]  Keep them up.
[19:20.470 --> 19:21.470]  Catch them up.
[19:21.470 --> 19:24.590]  While they're doing it, I'll fucking, I hoot and holler like Ric Flair.
[19:24.590 --> 19:29.150]  If we accomplish something and we get lunch 10 minutes early, you'll hear me go, woo.
[19:29.150 --> 19:31.790]  Because we get to go to lunch 10 minutes fucking early.
[19:31.790 --> 19:32.790]  We're going to go have a good time.
[19:32.950 --> 19:35.630]  That means you get two more dabs in is what that really means.
[19:35.630 --> 19:37.070]  So I hoot and holler.
[19:37.070 --> 19:39.270]  I fucking scream and yell.
[19:39.270 --> 19:40.270]  And nothing bad.
[19:40.270 --> 19:41.830]  I'm like, let's get it done, motherfuckers.
[19:41.830 --> 19:43.150]  We're going to grow some fucking weed today.
[19:43.150 --> 19:44.630]  And you just got to have a good time in there.
[19:44.630 --> 19:46.350]  I think keeping morale up really helps.
[19:46.350 --> 19:48.110]  So I go check on the guys hanging trellis.
[19:48.110 --> 19:50.090]  Then I'll go look at the guys transplanting.
[19:50.090 --> 19:51.750]  When they're transplanting, I'll walk by.
[19:51.750 --> 19:54.150]  If they look like they've fallen behind, I'll catch them up.
[19:54.150 --> 19:55.150]  I can do something.
[19:55.150 --> 19:56.250]  I know how to do all the shit.
[19:56.250 --> 19:57.250]  So I get my hands dirty.
[19:57.250 --> 19:59.510]  I do a couple of the things.
[19:59.510 --> 20:03.950]  Then as I'm leaving, I go, man, you guys look fucking sexy potting all these plants.
[20:03.950 --> 20:04.990]  You guys keep it going.
[20:04.990 --> 20:05.990]  If it's just a couple of bros.
[20:05.990 --> 20:08.110]  If it's a lady, I won't say that because I'll get myself in trouble.
[20:08.110 --> 20:09.110]  But you know what I mean?
[20:09.110 --> 20:10.110]  I'll say, you guys are kicking ass.
[20:10.110 --> 20:11.270]  You look fucking great doing it.
[20:11.270 --> 20:12.790]  I like your shoes.
[20:12.790 --> 20:13.790]  Something random.
[20:13.790 --> 20:15.310]  They know what I'm doing, but it still feels good.
[20:15.310 --> 20:16.310]  We're bonding.
[20:16.310 --> 20:17.990]  They're not just sucking at work all day.
[20:17.990 --> 20:20.550]  So then I go find the other guy who's cleaning something or whatever.
[20:20.550 --> 20:21.790]  And I clean up a little bit for him.
[20:21.790 --> 20:22.790]  Just catch him up.
[20:22.790 --> 20:24.670]  So now his cleaning job doesn't suck as much.
[20:24.670 --> 20:26.030]  He's like, bro, you're a bad motherfucker.
[20:26.030 --> 20:27.030]  You're the boss.
[20:27.030 --> 20:29.310]  You don't have to clean that, but you did.
[20:29.310 --> 20:30.310]  I'm not above anything.
[20:30.310 --> 20:32.650]  I started off as the bud tender, as the trimmer.
[20:32.650 --> 20:33.910]  I started off in the bottom.
[20:33.910 --> 20:35.950]  Now I'm fucking, let's everybody start somewhere.
[20:35.950 --> 20:37.250]  You just got to fucking earn your spot.
[20:37.250 --> 20:39.310]  So I've just been there longer than a lot of them.
[20:39.310 --> 20:40.630]  I respect all of them.
[20:40.630 --> 20:41.630]  I keep it fun.
[20:41.630 --> 20:42.630]  I help them.
[20:42.630 --> 20:47.070]  So keeping it fun with music and just being, I'm just a fucking jolly dude.
[20:47.070 --> 20:51.310]  I've kind of got an unspoken rule that if I can't tell you're high in the facility,
[20:51.310 --> 20:53.290]  nobody else can, and just shut up and be high.
[20:53.290 --> 20:56.270]  But the minute we can tell you're high, go fucking take a break.
[20:56.270 --> 20:59.590]  Get some water, drink some sodas or eat some cookies, get your shit back together, whatever
[20:59.590 --> 21:01.230]  you got to do to get it going.
[21:01.230 --> 21:04.710]  But if you're, if nobody can tell you're high, I don't know you're high.
[21:04.710 --> 21:06.030]  I can't be mad at you.
[21:06.030 --> 21:07.830]  So that's an unspoken thing.
[21:07.830 --> 21:09.850]  Be blazed if you can be blazed.
[21:09.850 --> 21:12.070]  We take a break every couple of hours.
[21:12.070 --> 21:13.070]  Sometimes I just buy pizza.
[21:13.070 --> 21:17.110]  If the guys are kicking ass and I see that a couple, I know that we get paid every two
[21:17.110 --> 21:18.110]  weeks.
[21:18.110 --> 21:20.670]  I know that around the end of that second week, a couple of the guys, we go to lunch
[21:20.670 --> 21:22.550]  breaks and their car doesn't leave the parking lot.
[21:22.550 --> 21:24.110]  It's because they don't got no weed or no money.
[21:24.110 --> 21:25.310]  I'll buy pizza the next day.
[21:25.350 --> 21:27.150]  I have to keep those guys fucking fed.
[21:27.150 --> 21:29.870]  One meal will get your fucking crew back, back on your team.
[21:29.870 --> 21:31.030]  It prevents a mutiny.
[21:31.030 --> 21:32.990]  So I'm Rick Flair and the fucking girl.
[21:32.990 --> 21:35.110]  I go, whoa, all day long.
[21:35.110 --> 21:36.270]  Fucking, you know, I'm coming.
[21:36.270 --> 21:37.270]  I cannot sneak up on you.
[21:37.270 --> 21:38.270]  I'm loud.
[21:38.270 --> 21:39.270]  We have a good time.
[21:39.270 --> 21:40.270]  We're bros.
[21:40.270 --> 21:41.270]  I love growing.
[21:41.270 --> 21:44.910]  So it hasn't sucked the fun out of it because I make it fun.
[21:44.910 --> 21:46.390]  Part of my job is to make it fun.
[21:46.390 --> 21:48.270]  I get to do different tasks every day.
[21:48.270 --> 21:50.470]  I was saying I get to help all the guys at different stations.
[21:50.470 --> 21:53.390]  That means I get to do different shit every single day.
[21:53.390 --> 21:55.190]  And I learn new stuff by doing that.
[21:55.270 --> 21:56.270]  I love learning.
[21:56.270 --> 21:59.630]  I'm passionately curious is what I think the term is.
[21:59.630 --> 22:00.630]  I love that.
[22:00.630 --> 22:07.350]  So it has not sucked the fun out of growing for me because I just simply won't let it.
[22:07.350 --> 22:08.350]  I make it fun.
[22:08.350 --> 22:09.350]  I love it.
[22:09.350 --> 22:10.470]  And it's never going to stop being fun.
[22:10.470 --> 22:13.150]  Now let me segue into the second part.
[22:13.150 --> 22:17.350]  I was on a live chat with my friend Scotty Real and a few other folks.
[22:17.350 --> 22:19.470]  And Scotty Real dropped a question.
[22:19.470 --> 22:23.910]  He said, man, with all of the technology and all of the things we have learned, has growing
[22:23.950 --> 22:27.470]  become easier or harder for you?
[22:27.470 --> 22:32.830]  And there are a couple of good answers from me for that question.
[22:32.830 --> 22:36.110]  I am at a level where I call myself a black belt grower.
[22:36.110 --> 22:37.950]  I don't try to be egotistical about it.
[22:37.950 --> 22:39.270]  I don't try to boast.
[22:39.270 --> 22:40.710]  I just know that I'm confident.
[22:40.710 --> 22:45.270]  And if there's a grow issue, a plant issue, a commercial cultivation issue, a small grow
[22:45.270 --> 22:49.590]  issue, a breeding question, I can probably cover and answer the question without much
[22:49.590 --> 22:50.590]  research.
[22:50.590 --> 22:53.430]  Sometimes I got to go, I don't know, let me check a couple of resources so I don't give
[22:53.430 --> 22:54.430]  you wrong details.
[22:54.430 --> 22:56.790]  But for the most part, I know the answer.
[22:56.790 --> 23:00.630]  So I'm like a black belt grower.
[23:00.630 --> 23:03.110]  With being a black belt grower, there's a lot of information.
[23:03.110 --> 23:05.510]  I know how to do a lot of shit.
[23:05.510 --> 23:08.630]  Hypothetically, I know how to throw a lot of kicks and a lot of fucking blocks.
[23:08.630 --> 23:11.270]  But that also gives me a lot of decisions to make.
[23:11.270 --> 23:13.650]  Which kick and which block do I throw?
[23:13.650 --> 23:15.090]  Sometimes you got to make a decision on the fly.
[23:15.090 --> 23:18.550]  You really hope you block that right punch and you don't get hit with a fucking left
[23:18.550 --> 23:20.510]  punch on accident.
[23:20.510 --> 23:22.390]  I hope you guys follow my karate analogies.
[23:22.390 --> 23:23.390]  It's fucking simple for me.
[23:23.390 --> 23:24.390]  I'm a black belt grower.
[23:24.390 --> 23:25.550]  You know where I'm going.
[23:25.550 --> 23:30.030]  So is growing harder or easier now that I'm a black belt grower?
[23:30.030 --> 23:34.830]  I've been given, not given, but I've got the controls, the keys, the driver's seat, and
[23:34.830 --> 23:40.830]  the codes, the launch codes to several large commercial cultivation facilities.
[23:40.830 --> 23:45.430]  I could make those facilities and those jobs as hard as I wanted to make them.
[23:45.430 --> 23:49.950]  There is a lot of shit to go wrong in a commercial cultivation facility.
[23:49.950 --> 23:54.890]  When I train new people in a grow, the first, usually they start in the middle of the day.
[23:54.890 --> 23:55.890]  We hire them.
[23:55.890 --> 23:56.890]  They come in about lunchtime.
[23:56.890 --> 24:00.150]  The second day they meet me at the door to go in at eight or nine in the morning or seven
[24:00.150 --> 24:01.950]  in the morning, wherever we are.
[24:01.950 --> 24:05.950]  As I'm turning off the alarm, I go, okay, here's the fun part.
[24:05.950 --> 24:10.730]  The first thing we do at every grow after you turn off the alarm and clock in is find
[24:10.730 --> 24:13.350]  what went wrong last night.
[24:13.350 --> 24:16.510]  I know it sounds shitty, but there are a lot of moving parts.
[24:16.510 --> 24:17.510]  There's more to break.
[24:17.510 --> 24:18.670]  There's more to maintain.
[24:18.670 --> 24:19.990]  There's more to take care of.
[24:19.990 --> 24:23.830]  There is more to find what the fuck went wrong last night.
[24:23.830 --> 24:26.830]  Some of my facilities have five to 700 lights.
[24:26.830 --> 24:27.830]  Something went wrong.
[24:27.830 --> 24:28.830]  There are pumps, there are fans.
[24:28.830 --> 24:30.990]  There are a lot of moving parts.
[24:30.990 --> 24:31.990]  Something went wrong.
[24:31.990 --> 24:34.090]  So every day we got to walk in and find out what went wrong.
[24:34.090 --> 24:37.070]  Sometimes that's the hardest part of commercial growing.
[24:37.070 --> 24:41.570]  Also commercial growing is everything you're doing at scale, mixing nutrients.
[24:41.570 --> 24:43.230]  You can really make a mistake.
[24:43.230 --> 24:47.430]  If you put in, if you do the math wrong, if you're trying to add for 50 gallons, you accidentally
[24:47.430 --> 24:52.030]  do seven milliliters times 50 instead of five, you just did a lot more nutrients on
[24:52.030 --> 24:53.030]  accident.
[24:53.030 --> 24:54.710]  Your mistakes can be much larger.
[24:54.710 --> 24:59.390]  So it's easier, but it's also harder, but I don't let it get too difficult.
[24:59.390 --> 25:02.670]  I try to keep it simple stoner.
[25:02.670 --> 25:04.830]  The more parts you add, the more shit that can break.
[25:04.830 --> 25:08.830]  So I try to keep a commercial grow reliable and self-sufficient.
[25:08.830 --> 25:10.750]  I don't like to water by myself by hand.
[25:10.750 --> 25:15.070]  I like an auto watering system, but it's not harder because I can see the issues.
[25:15.070 --> 25:16.830]  I've learned to read the plants.
[25:16.830 --> 25:17.950]  That makes things a lot easier.
[25:17.950 --> 25:19.950]  I've learned to calm the fuck down.
[25:19.950 --> 25:25.710]  My grower panic button is much pressed less much often when I was a new grower and I would
[25:25.710 --> 25:26.910]  see something weird in the plants.
[25:26.910 --> 25:27.910]  I call it the panic button.
[25:27.910 --> 25:29.870]  You just go, Oh shit, I have to flush.
[25:29.870 --> 25:30.870]  I have to spray.
[25:30.870 --> 25:31.870]  I have to defoliate.
[25:31.870 --> 25:34.350]  I have to call six friends and find out what they think I should do.
[25:34.350 --> 25:35.350]  Now I go, huh?
[25:35.350 --> 25:36.350]  Those leaves look like shit.
[25:36.350 --> 25:37.350]  I wonder what we did.
[25:37.350 --> 25:39.270]  And I just think about it and I solve the problem.
[25:39.270 --> 25:45.070]  So in the sense of my knowledge, growing is much easier with all of the technology shit
[25:45.070 --> 25:46.550]  can become way difficult.
[25:47.270 --> 25:52.070]  We've got controllers and watering controllers and light controllers and climate controllers
[25:52.070 --> 25:54.110]  and gigantic HVAC systems.
[25:54.110 --> 25:58.670]  I don't understand some of the, I don't understand most of the giant HVAC systems.
[25:58.670 --> 26:00.550]  So when they break, that's hard for me.
[26:00.550 --> 26:03.230]  That's the hard part is maintaining all of the gear.
[26:03.230 --> 26:04.950]  The hard part is maintaining the staff.
[26:04.950 --> 26:11.270]  The hard part is maintaining scheduling for rooms, employees, vacations, plants, transplants,
[26:11.270 --> 26:13.030]  fucking inspections.
[26:13.030 --> 26:14.030]  That's the hard part.
[26:14.030 --> 26:15.030]  It's not really the growing.
[26:15.030 --> 26:16.030]  I'm a black belt grower.
[26:16.510 --> 26:19.510]  I can handle 99% of what you throw at me as a grower.
[26:19.510 --> 26:23.550]  Now most of what I've said is relating to a commercial grow.
[26:23.550 --> 26:25.190]  Let's talk about a home grow.
[26:25.190 --> 26:29.890]  In a home grow, you would be surprised at how much of a caveman grow I run.
[26:29.890 --> 26:35.950]  I have got vented lights with a carbon filter and a blower blowing air over the vented light
[26:35.950 --> 26:36.990]  out of a window.
[26:36.990 --> 26:37.990]  That's my light setup.
[26:37.990 --> 26:40.770]  Thousand watt HPS lights for my breeding in my main area.
[26:40.770 --> 26:45.550]  Like I said, they may switch to the cannons, but for now that's what we've got.
[26:45.550 --> 26:48.630]  The lights are plugged into the blue one.
[26:48.630 --> 26:49.630]  What's it called?
[26:49.630 --> 26:51.150]  The blue control box, power box.
[26:51.150 --> 26:55.070]  I've got the one that controls four lights with the two accessory switches on there and
[26:55.070 --> 26:57.190]  that is set on 1212.
[26:57.190 --> 26:58.190]  What else is in there?
[26:58.190 --> 26:59.430]  A couple of fans.
[26:59.430 --> 27:02.030]  Everything is lifted up off the ground.
[27:02.030 --> 27:03.030]  Very low tech.
[27:03.030 --> 27:05.590]  It's just so the plants aren't touching the floor because I don't like my plants on the
[27:05.590 --> 27:06.590]  floor.
[27:06.590 --> 27:07.590]  Floor gets cold.
[27:07.590 --> 27:08.950]  I like them lifted up.
[27:08.950 --> 27:12.110]  Very low tech, three gallon pots, fucking some sticks.
[27:12.110 --> 27:13.310]  Sometimes I do trellising in that room.
[27:13.310 --> 27:16.070]  I move the plants a lot, so I prefer the sticks in there.
[27:16.070 --> 27:20.630]  But my technology for my personal grow is very simple.
[27:20.630 --> 27:22.790]  Keep it simple stoner.
[27:22.790 --> 27:24.350]  That keeps it really easy.
[27:24.350 --> 27:27.350]  The only things that can really die, I've got an air conditioner.
[27:27.350 --> 27:31.390]  The things that can really break in the room, the ballast could burn out, the light bulbs
[27:31.390 --> 27:35.990]  could burn out, the fan could die, the air conditioner could die, or the power box could
[27:35.990 --> 27:36.990]  die.
[27:36.990 --> 27:41.570]  But those are about my major pieces of equipment that I would have to replace or the PL minder
[27:41.570 --> 27:43.890]  units in there telling me what's going on.
[27:43.890 --> 27:47.290]  Also I've got a high temp shut off switch.
[27:47.290 --> 27:52.410]  My power box plugs into, so I've got a piece that plugs into my main plug.
[27:52.410 --> 27:54.610]  The power box plugs into that.
[27:54.610 --> 27:58.370]  The piece has a thermometer that hangs in the middle of the room.
[27:58.370 --> 28:02.970]  If the temperature exceeds 100 degrees, it cuts the power to everything in the room.
[28:02.970 --> 28:04.010]  Everything shuts off.
[28:04.010 --> 28:05.010]  Not everything.
[28:05.010 --> 28:09.490]  The fans and the air conditioner may stay on depending on how I've got the plugs configured,
[28:09.490 --> 28:10.770]  but my cooling will stay on.
[28:10.770 --> 28:11.770]  The lights will go off.
[28:11.770 --> 28:14.050]  That way the lights don't continue to roast the room.
[28:14.050 --> 28:16.250]  Mainly I've got the lights plugged into that most of the time.
[28:16.250 --> 28:17.650]  So the lights will turn off.
[28:17.650 --> 28:19.210]  I'll rescue the room.
[28:19.210 --> 28:23.490]  Then I'll get a notification from the PL minder unit that will say, bro, it's 105 degrees
[28:23.490 --> 28:24.490]  in the room.
[28:24.490 --> 28:25.490]  The lights went off.
[28:25.490 --> 28:26.490]  We don't know what the fuck's happening.
[28:26.490 --> 28:30.330]  I can either drive home or I can walk to the grow room and see what's going on and solve
[28:30.330 --> 28:31.330]  the issue.
[28:31.330 --> 28:36.050]  So I mainly like to keep it simple stoner in my personal grows.
[28:36.050 --> 28:37.050]  That keeps it easy.
[28:37.050 --> 28:38.050]  Nothing can break.
[28:38.050 --> 28:39.330]  It makes it easier to grow.
[28:40.170 --> 28:45.490]  In the commercial grow, we spend a lot of time cleaning filters, cleaning nozzles, cleaning
[28:45.490 --> 28:49.290]  sprayer jets, cleaning the dehumidifier.
[28:49.290 --> 28:50.930]  There is a lot of cleaning to be done.
[28:50.930 --> 28:52.730]  So it's not harder, but it's more maintenance.
[28:52.730 --> 28:55.270]  In a personal grow, I've got an air conditioner.
[28:55.270 --> 28:57.810]  I don't have a dehumidifier or a humidifier in that room.
[28:57.810 --> 29:00.770]  I let the plants and the fucking rest of the equipment kind of do that part.
[29:00.770 --> 29:01.770]  It's Colorado.
[29:01.770 --> 29:04.610]  It's kind of easy in my room to dial that in.
[29:04.610 --> 29:06.010]  I let the equipment do all the work for me.
[29:06.010 --> 29:09.290]  I think I lost track of my fucking train of thought there, but I don't have a lot of equipment.
[29:10.250 --> 29:13.890]  So I can spend more time, not so much time cleaning filters, cleaning shit.
[29:13.890 --> 29:17.650]  I'm just cleaning one air conditioner filter, and that's about really all I got to clean in there.
[29:18.650 --> 29:19.650]  I got to mop the floor occasionally.
[29:19.650 --> 29:22.090]  I got to fucking spray things down and clean shit up and change the bulbs.
[29:22.090 --> 29:26.170]  And I clean the glass, the glass between the bulb and the fucking plants.
[29:26.170 --> 29:27.650]  There's a little glass bulb in there.
[29:27.650 --> 29:29.530]  So the heat stays in there and the air moves it out.
[29:29.530 --> 29:33.170]  I clean that quite frequently, but there's not a lot of moving parts to take care of.
[29:33.170 --> 29:36.770]  So that gives me so much more time to play and focus on the plants.
[29:36.770 --> 29:40.090]  I don't have to touch so much working parts and machinery.
[29:40.090 --> 29:42.210]  Less shit to break, less to replace.
[29:42.210 --> 29:45.530]  That keeps it more fun.
[29:45.530 --> 29:50.210]  Does commercial growing suck the fun out of it was the original question that got me triggered on this.
[29:50.210 --> 29:53.130]  Sometimes it's stressful, but I keep it fun in there.
[29:53.130 --> 29:57.950]  Then I know that I get to come home and do whatever I want in that grow.
[29:57.950 --> 30:02.450]  If I want to run around in there with no clothes and no shoes and just my earbuds in my ears
[30:02.450 --> 30:05.730]  and listen to Joe Rogan talk about aliens, I can do that.
[30:05.730 --> 30:09.250]  If I want to wear my full on clothes just to get that other image out of your head and
[30:09.250 --> 30:13.010]  my shoes and still have Joe Rogan in my headphones, I can do that.
[30:13.010 --> 30:16.670]  If I want to sit on a five gallon bucket and smoke a joint, I don't smoke in the grow room,
[30:16.670 --> 30:22.290]  but if I wanted to, I could sit on a five gallon bucket, smoke a joint, listen to the
[30:22.290 --> 30:26.570]  fighter and the kid in my headphones or on their fucking radio, nice and loud.
[30:26.570 --> 30:27.850]  I don't have to worry about anybody in there.
[30:27.850 --> 30:29.130]  It's my personal grow.
[30:29.130 --> 30:32.770]  If I want to cut down all these plants, because it looks like fun, I could cut them all down.
[30:32.770 --> 30:35.250]  If I want to light them on fire, we could do it.
[30:35.250 --> 30:39.490]  I got my own personal grow, so I'll never quit having fun in my personal grow.
[30:39.490 --> 30:41.010]  I'm a breeder.
[30:41.010 --> 30:45.730]  I find two plants and I make them fuck and then I make seeds and then I get to grow those seeds.
[30:45.730 --> 30:50.330]  I'm like making packages of baseball cards and looking for Mickey Mantles all day, but
[30:50.330 --> 30:51.850]  I'm printing the cards.
[30:51.850 --> 30:53.130]  So that's a lot of fun.
[30:53.130 --> 30:54.330]  Phenohunts are fun.
[30:54.330 --> 30:55.330]  Breeding is fun.
[30:55.330 --> 30:59.370]  Watching what you do with my seeds is a lot of fun.
[30:59.370 --> 31:00.530]  I send seed packs out.
[31:00.530 --> 31:02.290]  You guys post them up on social media.
[31:02.290 --> 31:05.050]  I get to see what you did with my creations.
[31:05.050 --> 31:06.650]  That is really fun to me.
[31:06.650 --> 31:13.290]  So commercial growing can be stressful, but I handle stress with a big smile.
[31:13.290 --> 31:14.770]  I don't take shit like it's shit.
[31:14.770 --> 31:18.050]  I take shit like it's life because shit's always going to keep coming.
[31:18.050 --> 31:21.130]  If you let shit bug you, it's like if you show the dog you're weak, the dog's going
[31:21.130 --> 31:22.130]  to bite you more.
[31:22.130 --> 31:23.130]  I feel like life is the same.
[31:23.130 --> 31:26.130]  If you're like, oh, I'm losing life because you thought you were losing before, bitch,
[31:26.130 --> 31:27.130]  watch this.
[31:27.130 --> 31:30.250]  But if you go, man, I'm crushing it and you stay on top of your shit, life goes, you've
[31:30.250 --> 31:31.250]  been crushing it, dude.
[31:31.250 --> 31:32.890]  We're going to just make sure you keep crushing it.
[31:32.890 --> 31:35.810]  We're going to put you on the path of crush, crush, crush.
[31:35.810 --> 31:36.810]  All right.
[31:36.810 --> 31:40.290]  I think I've rambled for quite a bit for a Thursday episode.

[32:58.450 --> 32:59.450]  That's my favorite comment.
[32:59.450 --> 33:00.450]  I agree.
[33:00.450 --> 33:01.450]  Why do I only have 3000?
[33:01.450 --> 33:02.450]  I'm not complaining.
[33:02.450 --> 33:04.570]  I appreciate all 3000 of you.
[33:04.570 --> 33:06.090]  Let's get that shit up to 10,000.
[33:06.090 --> 33:07.250]  I'm just joking, you guys.

[33:20.610 --> 33:21.610]  We'll be more available.
[33:21.610 --> 33:25.610]  We will overgrow the entire planet altogether.
[33:25.610 --> 33:26.610]  Let's do that.
[33:26.610 --> 33:27.610]  All right.

[33:47.290 --> 33:50.690]  I want to give a giant shout out to my friend, Mr. Soul.
[33:50.690 --> 33:53.770]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
