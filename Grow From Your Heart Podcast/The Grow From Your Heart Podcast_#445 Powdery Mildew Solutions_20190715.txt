[00:00.000 --> 00:06.160]  Welcome back, Podcast World! It is time for Episode 445 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:06.160 --> 00:09.840]  This episode of the show is brought to you by my friends at Seeds Here Now. If you need
[00:09.840 --> 00:20.240]  new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Seeds Here Now, and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:20.240 --> 00:23.360]  You know, it has become a tradition that we start this podcast off by talking about what
[00:23.360 --> 00:28.560]  I'm smoking. Today, I've been taking dabs of watermelon gelato ambrosia from our friends
[00:28.560 --> 00:37.200]  at Apothecary Farms. The potency label says this product contains 64.6% THC and 76.7%
[00:37.200 --> 00:41.040]  total cannabinoids. I'm cracking open the jar right now so I can give it a fresh smell.
[00:42.640 --> 00:47.760]  The first smell that hits my face is exactly watermelons. It is like watermelon candies.
[00:47.760 --> 00:53.200]  It is delicious. Then there is sort of a funky, gassy thing in the background. It is amazing.
[00:53.200 --> 00:58.800]  When you dab it, it tastes like fresh watermelon candies with a hint of green apples. I really
[00:58.800 --> 01:04.160]  love the watermelon gelato. So big shout out to my friends at Apothecary Farms for the delicious
[01:04.160 --> 01:08.560]  concentrates. Ladies and gentlemen, in this episode, I'm going to address a couple of
[01:08.560 --> 01:13.040]  questions that people asked me about correcting powdery mildew and handling bugs in a grow room.
[01:13.040 --> 01:17.440]  But before we get there, I'd like to do a shout out to a few of my friends on Patreon.
[01:17.440 --> 01:21.200]  How about a big giant Grow From Your Heart Podcast shout out to my friend Todd K.

[02:06.000 --> 02:10.480]  big shout out to everybody who has helped the show in the past, in the present, and in the future.
[02:11.280 --> 02:15.280]  All right, podcast world. At the start of the show, I said I was going to address a question
[02:15.360 --> 02:21.120]  about spray applications to take care of powdery mildew and pests. Let's jump into that.
[02:21.120 --> 02:25.440]  I was in an Instagram live feed today, and somebody kept asking questions about what
[02:25.440 --> 02:30.000]  they can spray to take care of powdery mildew. Then they asked what they can spray to take
[02:30.000 --> 02:36.800]  care of their bugs. Now, spraying is a good way to minimize a pest population. Spraying is a good way
[02:36.800 --> 02:44.400]  to minimize potential powdery mildew problems. But spraying products is not a long-term solution
[02:44.400 --> 02:48.800]  to cure problems in a grow environment. Let's talk about that for a little bit here.
[02:48.800 --> 02:52.880]  The plants in this person's garden are obviously displaying that they are infected with powdery
[02:52.880 --> 02:57.360]  mildew. He can see it. It is visible. It is present. Now, it's going to be really easy to
[02:57.360 --> 03:02.160]  grab a product and spray it all over those plants and wash that powdery mildew off and act like we
[03:02.160 --> 03:06.560]  have just solved the problem. It's not visible. It's out of sight. It's out of mind. We think it
[03:06.560 --> 03:12.160]  may be cured. The problem is solved. Let's move forward. It is not that simple. Depending on the
[03:12.160 --> 03:16.720]  product you applied, depending on the environment, depending on the conditions, that powdery mildew
[03:16.720 --> 03:22.080]  has a very good potential of coming back. All you did was give that plant a little bath. You did not
[03:22.080 --> 03:26.560]  destroy. You did not kill that powdery mildew. You just rinsed it off. You probably just spread
[03:26.560 --> 03:30.960]  it out to tell you the truth. So your powdery mildew is going to come back. All we have done
[03:30.960 --> 03:35.120]  is a temporary fix. It looks like it's gone, but it is going to come back and it is going to be
[03:35.120 --> 03:39.440]  worse. Then what are you going to do when it comes back with a vengeance? You had a little powdery
[03:39.440 --> 03:43.280]  mildew. You sprayed it with a product that knocked it down for a little bit, but then when
[03:43.280 --> 03:47.360]  it came back, it was even stronger. Now what are you going to do? You're going to spray again so
[03:47.360 --> 03:52.000]  that it can come back even stronger. Then as the plants get older, as the cycle progresses,
[03:52.000 --> 03:56.480]  you're going to get big fat juicy buds. Are you going to spray those? I don't want to consume
[03:56.480 --> 04:01.440]  your buds that were sprayed with any sort of product that is used to treat powdery mildew.
[04:01.440 --> 04:06.400]  Once your plants get big fat buds, if you continue to spray them, you're going to destroy the flavor.
[04:06.400 --> 04:10.960]  You're going to destroy the aroma. They're going to burn funky. Your buds are going to taste funny.
[04:10.960 --> 04:16.800]  In a lot of commercial grow environments, I see people attempt to use a sulfur burner to minimize
[04:16.800 --> 04:22.720]  the risk of powdery mildew. That works to get rid of powdery mildew, but it also puts a terrible,
[04:22.720 --> 04:28.240]  shitty sulfur flavor in the finished product. Also, if you turn that finished product into
[04:28.240 --> 04:33.920]  a concentrate, it makes the concentrate taste like burnt fish. It is disgusting. So do not
[04:33.920 --> 04:40.160]  use a sulfur burner in your grow. That is my advice. That is my opinion. Many people will argue
[04:40.160 --> 04:44.720]  with that. I do not like it. I do not approve. You will be able to taste it and it will ruin
[04:44.720 --> 04:50.640]  your concentrates. So I highly advise against the sulfur burner. Now let's talk more about spraying.
[04:50.640 --> 04:54.640]  What are you going to do? Are you just going to keep spraying forever? Spraying will not last
[04:54.640 --> 04:59.840]  forever. Spraying is like a temporary bandaid for whatever problem you have got. If you've got a
[04:59.840 --> 05:04.000]  giant gash on your arm, you need some stitches, are you just going to keep putting little band-aids
[05:04.000 --> 05:07.920]  over it every day and hope that shit closes? Or are you just going to suck it up and go to the ER
[05:07.920 --> 05:12.880]  and get seven stitches and get that shit fixed? Sometimes you need to just bite the bullet and
[05:12.880 --> 05:16.880]  fix the grow room. You need to figure out the problem and you need to correct the issue and
[05:16.880 --> 05:21.760]  quit spraying every day. Spraying will get expensive. If you have a small garden, it may
[05:21.760 --> 05:27.280]  not add up as quickly. If you are in a commercial environment, spraying a large room will become
[05:27.280 --> 05:32.720]  very expensive very quickly. First, you have to buy whatever product you are going to apply.
[05:32.720 --> 05:38.080]  If you have a large room, a large facility, you're buying a lot of product. Then you need an
[05:38.080 --> 05:42.240]  applicator. That is going to get expensive depending on the size of your grow, the size
[05:42.240 --> 05:46.160]  of your environment. You need something that can effectively and efficiently cover all of your
[05:46.160 --> 05:51.920]  plants with the pesticide product you choose to use. Then once you've got the products, you need
[05:51.920 --> 05:58.000]  to pay somebody to apply that product to your grow. They're using manpower. They're using time.
[05:58.000 --> 06:02.800]  Also, they're damaging the plants. They're decreasing the overall quality of your finished
[06:02.800 --> 06:08.560]  product by applying that pesticide. Also, you are cutting that room off for work for the rest of the
[06:08.560 --> 06:14.880]  day. In most cases, a pesticide application will have a re-entry interval in which you are not
[06:14.880 --> 06:21.440]  allowed to enter that room until that time period has passed. Most pesticides have a minimum of a
[06:21.440 --> 06:28.480]  four-hour re-entry interval. In most cases, that is half of a work shift. That will eliminate access
[06:28.480 --> 06:32.880]  to that room for the rest of the staff for probably half the day. If there was more work to
[06:32.880 --> 06:37.280]  be done in there, you're shit out of luck. You can't defoliate. You can't do any of the extra
[06:37.280 --> 06:41.040]  catch-up work. You can't put up trellising. You can't do any popping and twisting because that
[06:41.040 --> 06:47.040]  room is off limits now. It is shut down. It is under a re-entry interval and the door is marked,
[06:47.040 --> 06:53.040]  do not enter until this time. So applying pesticides will become costly. In the long run,
[06:53.040 --> 06:58.240]  correcting the issue that is causing the problem will be more efficient than reapplying pesticides
[06:58.240 --> 07:03.600]  every three days. I didn't even think about the cost of training an employee to spray that room.
[07:03.600 --> 07:06.800]  That employee has to be trained. They have to have Department of Agriculture
[07:07.360 --> 07:15.040]  pesticide safety training if they want to apply a pesticide. They have to have an OSHA respirator
[07:15.040 --> 07:19.520]  fit certification, which means they have to go to a doctor and they have to put on the respirator
[07:19.520 --> 07:24.320]  that they intend to use when they apply pesticides. They have to show that they know how to put on
[07:24.320 --> 07:28.400]  that respirator correctly. They have to show that it fits them correctly around their face and there
[07:28.400 --> 07:32.000]  are no air leaks. Then they have to show that they can remove it correctly without getting
[07:32.000 --> 07:36.960]  pesticides on their face. They also have to show that they can clean it and keep it up to date.
[07:36.960 --> 07:41.680]  That is an expensive class. That is an expensive doctor appointment. So that is another thing that
[07:41.680 --> 07:46.880]  you have to pay for when it comes to a pesticide applicator. Also, you have to pay for all of the
[07:46.880 --> 07:52.400]  personal protective equipment. Every time somebody applies a pesticide, they need to suit up in a
[07:52.400 --> 07:57.360]  commercial environment. Anybody that I am responsible for wears a full Tyvek suit when
[07:57.360 --> 08:02.080]  they're applying a pesticide. They're suited up from head to toe. They've got the hood up. They've
[08:02.080 --> 08:06.080]  got the appropriate goggles. Some of my dudes wear that big, full face mask respirator that
[08:06.080 --> 08:10.800]  covers your whole face. You look like the fucking SWAT team. I like that one really well. We wear
[08:10.800 --> 08:16.080]  at least six millimeter thick gloves depending on the pesticides we're applying. Most of the time,
[08:16.080 --> 08:19.760]  it's a six millimeter, sometimes a little bit thicker of a glove. We've got the appropriate
[08:19.760 --> 08:24.880]  gloves based on the pesticides we're using. We're suited up. All of that shit is very expensive.
[08:24.880 --> 08:30.480]  Those Tyvek suits are one-time use. You go in the room, you spray, you get coated in pesticide.
[08:30.480 --> 08:33.920]  You got to take that suit off and throw it away. You basically do your best to step out of it
[08:33.920 --> 08:38.720]  without touching it too much. Those respirator cartridges, those are expensive to replace.
[08:38.720 --> 08:44.000]  The respirators are quite expensive to replace. All of the gloves we go through are extremely
[08:44.000 --> 08:48.000]  expensive when you go through them in the volumes that we do in a commercial grow environment.
[08:48.000 --> 08:53.520]  All of those little costs will add up. In the long run, whatever was causing your powdery mildew
[08:53.520 --> 08:59.360]  issue would probably have been cheaper just to correct that in one big bite. That is a good way
[08:59.360 --> 09:05.680]  to segue into some of the things that are probably causing the powdery mildew. In my opinion, the most
[09:05.680 --> 09:11.520]  common cause of powdery mildew is an incorrect VPD. That's right, vapor pressure deficit. I have
[09:11.520 --> 09:17.280]  done a full episode on VPD. If you are interested in learning a lot about vapor pressure deficit,
[09:17.280 --> 09:21.840]  I recommend episode 314 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast. It is actually titled
[09:21.840 --> 09:28.080]  Vapor Pressure Deficit. That episode will teach you a lot. But I think VPD is the most common
[09:28.080 --> 09:33.280]  cause of powdery mildew, and that includes excessive heat and high humidity. Another
[09:33.280 --> 09:39.120]  thing that I think really contributes to powdery mildew is temperature swings, diurnal temperature
[09:39.120 --> 09:44.800]  swing. When your day and night temperature change, if your day is 80 degrees and your night is 60
[09:44.800 --> 09:49.680]  degrees, you are giving yourself a really good opportunity for powdery mildew development.
[09:49.680 --> 09:56.240]  Try not to have more than a five to seven degree swing in your diurnal temperatures. 10 degrees max,
[09:56.240 --> 10:01.760]  maybe 12 degrees. I'd like to see you stay within five to seven degrees temperature swing from day
[10:01.760 --> 10:06.960]  to night. 10 degrees is cool, 12 degrees is pushing it, 15 to 20, you're going to start
[10:06.960 --> 10:12.640]  causing yourself problems. Another thing that I think often contributes to powdery mildew is
[10:12.640 --> 10:17.840]  excessive water left in the grow room. Sometimes I see small puddles in a commercial environment
[10:17.840 --> 10:22.080]  just because shit happens in the grow. We're busy. Sometimes we're cleaning things. Sometimes
[10:22.080 --> 10:26.560]  we're watering things. Sometimes we just spill some shit and there is water left in the grow.
[10:26.560 --> 10:30.720]  Sometimes there's a bucket left somewhere with water in it. Sometimes the tables, the flood to
[10:30.720 --> 10:35.280]  drain tables will get clogged with debris at the drain and you don't clean that out and then the
[10:35.280 --> 10:39.520]  table will get a little layer of water in there. Then you start seeing that little green algae
[10:39.520 --> 10:45.680]  build up on your table. That will also contribute to powdery mildew. Another thing I think contributes
[10:45.680 --> 10:51.120]  to powdery mildew is improper airflow. I talked about in a previous episode, people squish their
[10:51.120 --> 10:56.400]  plants too close together. That will contribute to powdery mildew. Also, you need some fans in
[10:56.400 --> 11:03.280]  the room. Move some air around. Also, another critical thing, you can't just move air around.
[11:03.280 --> 11:08.320]  We need air exchange. You have to get that old stagnant air out and put some fresh air in the
[11:08.320 --> 11:14.000]  room. You need a dehumidifier. You may need a humidifier and you need air exchange. Some folks
[11:14.000 --> 11:18.400]  may be working a sealed environment. They are advanced growers. They understand how to control
[11:18.400 --> 11:22.640]  the environment and keep things safe. If they're running a sealed environment, I'm pretty confident
[11:22.640 --> 11:27.440]  in their skills. They're running CO2 to augment the CO2 to keep the CO2 high in there. They don't
[11:27.440 --> 11:32.560]  need much advice on keeping the powdery mildew under control, hopefully at this point. Another
[11:32.560 --> 11:38.080]  thing I see that people commonly overlook when they are starting to have powdery mildew issues is
[11:38.080 --> 11:43.520]  defoliation. If you've got powdery mildew on a leaf, why not pull the damn leaf off? Take it
[11:43.520 --> 11:49.520]  off of there. That is less opportunity for a bug or a piece of mildew to attach itself to your plant.
[11:49.520 --> 11:54.560]  Less places to hang out, less things to hang out. That is just good logic in my opinion.
[11:54.560 --> 11:59.360]  Also, you will reduce the amount of water that those plants release into the air because there
[11:59.360 --> 12:03.760]  are not as many leaves. Basically, there aren't as many mouth breathers in there spitting out a
[12:03.760 --> 12:08.560]  bunch of hot air. So defoliate and that will help you out. Another thing that will help you
[12:08.560 --> 12:15.120]  tremendously is to just basically clean up the grow space. I talk a lot about cleaning up. I
[12:15.120 --> 12:20.640]  find it really important to clean up the grow space. Also, clean your tools. If you're going
[12:20.640 --> 12:25.520]  from one plant to another plant or from one table to another table, why not just dip your scissors
[12:25.520 --> 12:30.880]  into some rubbing alcohol and dry them off with a paper towel and keep moving? Sterilize your shit.
[12:30.880 --> 12:34.720]  That way, if one plant's infected with something, you don't move it right along through the entire
[12:34.720 --> 12:39.920]  garden, which is another great way to segue into this next bullet point. I don't have any of this
[12:39.920 --> 12:42.960]  shit written down, you guys. This is all flying out of the top of my head just so that you know
[12:42.960 --> 12:48.320]  that today. The next thing I was going to talk about is infected clones. Another way that I see
[12:48.320 --> 12:53.760]  people bring powdery mildew into a grow is by bringing a clone from a friend or a dispensary
[12:53.760 --> 12:59.840]  or wherever that had powdery mildew on that clone already. Quite often, clones travel around our
[12:59.840 --> 13:06.800]  country. Allegedly, clones may happen to go across the country in a sealed baggie and then also
[13:06.800 --> 13:11.440]  inside of a box and they are moved from one point to another and they are left in that packaging for
[13:11.440 --> 13:16.480]  quite some time. Often, when those clones are opened up, they have developed powdery mildew
[13:16.480 --> 13:21.920]  inside that packaging. The person who received that package is so excited to get that new clone
[13:21.920 --> 13:26.400]  that they don't give a shit about the powdery mildew. They forget to look. They pop that clone
[13:26.400 --> 13:30.480]  into a little bit of dirt. They put it right into the general population of their grow room.
[13:30.480 --> 13:35.200]  They put it right next to the fan. And then in three or four days, the entire room has got a
[13:35.200 --> 13:41.600]  nice little sprinkle of powdery mildew. That is a very, very common way for folks to get PM.
[13:41.600 --> 13:45.760]  You get a clone from a friend, you get a clone from a dispensary, maybe you get a clone from
[13:45.760 --> 13:50.880]  a friend online or something like that and it ends up in your grow and you have now contaminated your
[13:50.880 --> 13:56.400]  entire grow. That is a big mistake. If you ever get a new plant from anybody, I don't care if it's
[13:56.400 --> 14:00.880]  your best friend. I don't care if it's your mama. I don't care if it's your mentor. If you get a new
[14:00.880 --> 14:06.960]  clone from anybody, quarantine that clone and make sure that it is pest and pathogen-free before
[14:06.960 --> 14:12.640]  you introduce that plant into your general population. As a responsible gardener, you cannot
[14:12.640 --> 14:18.160]  blame your friends, your fellow growers, whoever gave you that clone for giving you powdery mildew,
[14:18.160 --> 14:23.680]  spider mites, thrips. Whatever comes with that plant is not their fault. It is your fault for
[14:23.680 --> 14:29.520]  not being responsible and treating that clone as if it had every bug and pathogen on the planet
[14:29.520 --> 14:34.800]  when it was brought to your grow. It is your responsibility to make sure that plant is clean.
[14:34.800 --> 14:39.600]  Everybody thinks their garden is clean. Everybody thinks their plants are pest and pathogen-free.
[14:39.600 --> 14:44.640]  Most of those people are wrong. What I have found is the people who boast the most about having a
[14:44.640 --> 14:49.520]  clean and pest and pathogen-free garden are the ones with the most problems. They just haven't
[14:49.520 --> 14:54.640]  discovered the problems yet. So be very careful. All right. So I have talked about how we get
[14:54.640 --> 14:59.440]  powdery mildew. I have talked about how sprays are only temporarily effective and how they will
[14:59.440 --> 15:04.720]  not solve the problem for long-term. So let's talk about things we can do to correct the room
[15:04.720 --> 15:11.280]  and make sure we do not get powdery mildew ever again. First off, let's start treating any incoming
[15:11.280 --> 15:17.520]  plants with proper pesticides and proper fungicide sprays. Now, yes, I have been ranting that sprays
[15:17.520 --> 15:21.680]  are not the solution to everything, but if you're bringing something in, you want to spray it,
[15:21.680 --> 15:25.680]  you want to treat it so that you don't introduce a problem to the rest of your grow.
[15:25.680 --> 15:30.080]  You don't want somebody else's problems. We can't correct their room, so let's correct the plant
[15:30.080 --> 15:34.400]  that they brought us. That's where we have to start. Now, let's make sure that the room we're
[15:34.400 --> 15:40.000]  going to put that new plant into is proper. Let's make sure we have got the proper VPD.
[15:40.000 --> 15:45.440]  I'm going to leave it up to you to understand and study VPD. Once again, I did a podcast all about
[15:45.440 --> 15:52.480]  it. It is episode 314. Check that out. Get your VPD dialed in. Get your temperature and humidity
[15:52.480 --> 15:58.720]  dialed in. Get your airflow dialed in. Make sure you don't have any microclimates in your
[15:58.720 --> 16:05.040]  grow space. What that means is, is it 80 degrees over here? Is it 72 degrees over here? Is it 68
[16:05.040 --> 16:11.120]  degrees down here under this canopy? You need enough airflow to keep a homogenous environment.
[16:11.120 --> 16:16.880]  You want it 80 degrees over here, 80 degrees over here, 60% humidity over here, 60% humidity
[16:16.880 --> 16:21.360]  over here. You don't want big swings and jumps throughout the room. Maybe another thing that
[16:21.360 --> 16:27.680]  you may need is a proper grow room monitor, something that can actually monitor the VPD
[16:27.680 --> 16:31.760]  of your room. You need to pay attention to those things. If we don't know what's going on in there,
[16:31.760 --> 16:37.760]  we don't know what is causing problems. Dial in the VPD. Dial in the temperature and the humidity.
[16:37.760 --> 16:44.880]  Get your airflow up to speed. Clean up the room. Remove any excess water that does not need to be
[16:44.880 --> 16:50.480]  in the room. Maybe you're over-watering the plants. Perhaps you were trying to saturate your medium
[16:50.480 --> 16:56.560]  a little too heavily. Maybe you need to saturate a little less and let the medium dry and then water
[16:56.560 --> 17:02.240]  again. Instead of one big fat watering through the day, maybe do two medium waterings. That way,
[17:02.240 --> 17:07.280]  you have less water in the air, less water in the room. That will help you out.
[17:07.280 --> 17:11.680]  Another thing I highly suggest to help you minimize the potential of powdery mildew is
[17:11.680 --> 17:18.960]  to defoliate. The less leaf in the room, the less potential for problems. I also suggest that you
[17:18.960 --> 17:23.680]  dial in your diurnal temperature swings. You don't want drastic swings from your day and night
[17:23.680 --> 17:29.040]  temperatures. Make sure things aren't going crazy there. Also, make sure your humidity swings aren't
[17:29.040 --> 17:34.160]  crazy when your lights go off. You've got the lights on all day. That is putting heat in the
[17:34.160 --> 17:38.400]  air. That is making the water rise. Then the lights go off. All that moisture is in the air.
[17:38.400 --> 17:42.240]  It doesn't know what to do. The humidity spikes. It goes crazy in the room for a few minutes.
[17:42.240 --> 17:46.560]  If you've got the proper monitoring gear, you can see what is happening at the lights on and
[17:46.560 --> 17:51.520]  lights off in your room. In a lot of cases, that is where we start developing powdery mildew
[17:51.520 --> 17:55.680]  problems. Make sure you're not getting temperature swings. Make sure you're not getting humidity
[17:55.680 --> 18:00.880]  spikes. Then another thing we can think about is to make sure that none of the air being drawn
[18:00.880 --> 18:06.400]  into the room is extremely cool. Some growers like to pull air from outside during the winter
[18:06.400 --> 18:10.960]  because they think that helps cool the room. That is actually giving you a huge potential
[18:10.960 --> 18:15.520]  for powdery mildew. You're bringing that cool air into the warm grow room. It is going to create
[18:15.520 --> 18:21.040]  moisture. That will begin to create perfect conditions for powdery mildew. If you take
[18:21.040 --> 18:25.840]  some time to correct your vapor pressure deficit, get your temperature and your humidity dialed in,
[18:25.840 --> 18:31.200]  make sure that your airflow is proper, clean up that grow room, maybe add a few fans, maybe add
[18:31.200 --> 18:35.760]  an extraction fan so that you can suck that humidity out, maybe add an intake fan so that
[18:35.760 --> 18:41.200]  you can suck some fresh air into the room. Maybe some small adjustments will help you minimize the
[18:41.200 --> 18:45.120]  risks of getting powdery mildew. Now, here's something that just came to my mind when I was
[18:45.120 --> 18:50.720]  talking about moving air around. This is something funny that I see in a lot of commercial environments.
[18:50.720 --> 18:55.200]  You've got multiple flowering rooms and multiple bedrooms in one big building.
[18:55.920 --> 19:00.320]  A lot of times, there's a hallway. In most facilities, there's one long hallway with
[19:00.320 --> 19:04.560]  flowering rooms all along one side and flowering rooms all along another side,
[19:04.560 --> 19:09.200]  just separated by walls and doors. It's basically like an apartment building. You got a long hallway
[19:09.200 --> 19:13.040]  and you got apartment A, apartment B, apartment C, and then on the other side, you got D, E, and F,
[19:13.040 --> 19:19.040]  right? Except I do them letters and numbers just because I'm weird. A lot of facilities I see,
[19:19.040 --> 19:24.400]  they're ducting the heat straight out of room A into that hallway. They're ducting that heat
[19:24.400 --> 19:29.600]  straight out of room B into the hallway. They're ducting the heat from room C into the hallway.
[19:29.600 --> 19:35.520]  Also, their air conditioner intake is in the hallway. You're just dumping hot air into the
[19:35.520 --> 19:39.200]  hallway and then trying to suck that right back up through the air conditioner intake.
[19:39.200 --> 19:42.960]  All that humid air, all that stagnant air is just going right back into the grow.
[19:42.960 --> 19:47.120]  You're fighting yourself. Think about your ducting. Think about efficiency that way.
[19:47.120 --> 19:51.280]  Are you heating up a room where you're pulling your air conditioning air through? Are you
[19:51.280 --> 19:55.440]  humidifying a room that you're trying to dehumidify? Are you dumping the hot air into a
[19:55.440 --> 19:59.440]  room where you're fighting yourself? Just think about air efficiency when it comes to designing
[19:59.440 --> 20:04.400]  your HVAC system and where the heat and humidity end up. I can think of one clear example where
[20:04.400 --> 20:09.200]  there's a grow facility where they've got their heat duct shooting the heat, their extractions
[20:09.200 --> 20:13.280]  shooting the heat right into the hallway, but then right across that hallway is an intake fan
[20:13.280 --> 20:18.080]  sucking what should be fresh cool air into that flowering room. It's actually sucking all of that
[20:18.080 --> 20:22.480]  heat straight out of the other room into that room, and it heats up that room perpetually,
[20:22.480 --> 20:26.800]  and that room never gets cooled down. So that room has been designated as a veg space because
[20:26.800 --> 20:31.200]  they can't figure out how to cool it. I told them, spend a few bucks, redirect your air,
[20:31.200 --> 20:36.160]  and that problem will be solved. Unfortunately, that is not how all owners see things.
[20:36.160 --> 20:39.680]  They would rather just make the grow team struggle and make it hard on them and then
[20:39.680 --> 20:44.400]  yell at everybody because they can't reach production goals. Unfortunately, all too often,
[20:44.400 --> 20:49.600]  that is how a commercial grow environment will work. But my point of this 20-minute rant, you
[20:49.600 --> 20:56.160]  guys, is that sprays are not a long-term solution. Sprays are temporary quick fixes that will not
[20:56.160 --> 20:59.840]  solve the problem. You can't just keep spraying forever. What are you going to do? Are you going
[20:59.840 --> 21:04.480]  to spray every three days? You're going to be buying personal protective equipment every week.
[21:04.480 --> 21:08.960]  You're going to be buying more pesticide and more fungicide every week. Solve the problem.
[21:08.960 --> 21:13.840]  Fix the air conditioner. Fix all those air conditioner gaps. Fix all the ducting gaps.
[21:13.840 --> 21:17.520]  Just solve the bullshit, and your whole grow will be more enjoyable.
[21:17.520 --> 21:21.840]  Now, let's shift gears and talk about the same thing, but we're going to focus more on pests
[21:21.840 --> 21:28.720]  this time. Most often, pests come in on clones, or you bring them in the grow yourself, or they find
[21:28.720 --> 21:34.480]  the most minute crack in the walls, and they sneak their way in. But I believe that most commonly,
[21:34.480 --> 21:39.120]  they come in with a clone, or they come in on your clothes, on your shoes, or you bring them
[21:39.120 --> 21:43.360]  in from your home grow, or from your commercial grow. Maybe you've got a friend that grows at
[21:43.360 --> 21:47.280]  home, or you've got multiple friends that grow at other places. You guys all go hang out at the same
[21:47.280 --> 21:52.560]  place. You sit on the same couch. His thrips crawl onto your shorts. Your spider mites crawl onto his
[21:52.560 --> 21:56.880]  shorts. You guys go home. Now, you both have thrips and spider mites. I just think that since
[21:56.880 --> 22:01.760]  everybody is growing cannabis, we are all just constantly trading bugs. So we've got to think
[22:01.760 --> 22:08.320]  about pest management. Before you go into your grow, change into your dedicated grow room clothes.
[22:08.320 --> 22:12.080]  You should have grow room shoes. You should have some grow room pants. You should have grow room
[22:12.080 --> 22:16.560]  shirts. You should have a separate grow room hat. You can't just wear your normal hat. That's not
[22:16.560 --> 22:20.720]  going to work. You want separate clothes for your grow space, so that when you come in and out of
[22:20.720 --> 22:25.680]  that grow, you're basically wearing your uniform. This will help you out in so many ways. You're
[22:25.680 --> 22:29.600]  only going to get pesticides on those clothes, because when you're in the grow, if you've
[22:29.600 --> 22:33.360]  applied a pesticide, every time you rub up against that plant and that wall, you're now
[22:33.360 --> 22:39.120]  getting pesticides on your clothes. So have some designated clothes. Also have designated shoes.
[22:39.120 --> 22:42.640]  You don't want to be, I'm a hippie. I'm out hiking on the trails. I'm running in the mountains.
[22:42.640 --> 22:46.960]  I don't want to go take my mountain shoes into my grow room or into a commercial grow
[22:46.960 --> 22:50.960]  and think about whatever kind of bugs I may have picked up out near Red Rocks or out at the Canyon
[22:50.960 --> 22:54.400]  Trail and take that shit into a commercial environment. The next day I walk in and there
[22:54.400 --> 22:59.600]  are fucking aphids everywhere. Oh, I would be so mad at myself. So get yourself some dedicated
[22:59.600 --> 23:04.560]  grow room shoes, some dedicated grow room clothes, all the way up to the hat.
[23:04.560 --> 23:08.400]  If you're in a commercial facility, I almost recommend changing. If you've got a lab coat
[23:08.400 --> 23:12.400]  or if you've got the opportunity to change clothes between big rooms, I would definitely
[23:12.400 --> 23:18.080]  suggest that. If you've got a room in a commercial facility that is contaminated with bugs,
[23:18.080 --> 23:22.960]  make that the last room you work on every day so that you don't start in that room.
[23:22.960 --> 23:26.560]  Get yourself coated in spider mites and then drag them through the rest of the grow throughout the
[23:26.560 --> 23:31.520]  day. Start in the cleanest room, then work your way to the dirty room and then go home.
[23:31.520 --> 23:35.120]  That way you don't take those bugs through the rest of the grow. That way you're probably going
[23:35.120 --> 23:39.360]  to take them home, but as soon as you get home, drop those clothes in the dirty clothes pile,
[23:39.360 --> 23:43.120]  take a quick shower, put on some fresh clothes or put on your grow room clothes,
[23:43.120 --> 23:47.280]  then head to your grow room and handle your shit. But you need to switch clothes before
[23:47.280 --> 23:52.800]  grow spaces. I also recommend switching clothes between your indoor and outdoor grow space if
[23:52.800 --> 23:57.280]  you've got the opportunity. I understand switching clothes can be quite time consuming if you need to
[23:57.280 --> 24:01.040]  do it multiple times in a day. Maybe if you've got a couple of lab coats or something you can
[24:01.040 --> 24:06.240]  switch in and out of, that would be helpful. But do anything you can to minimize the opportunity
[24:06.240 --> 24:11.760]  of bringing a stowaway pest from grow to grow. So I think some of the most efficient ways to
[24:11.760 --> 24:16.240]  prevent yourself from getting spider mites is to treat any clones that come into your grow. Act
[24:16.240 --> 24:20.960]  like that any plant that comes into your grow has got all of the bugs and all of the problems.
[24:20.960 --> 24:25.440]  Act like that thing is a trap. You've got to treat that plant for spider mites, for thrips,
[24:25.440 --> 24:30.320]  for aphids, and for powdery mildew before you even think about bringing it into the grow.
[24:30.320 --> 24:36.240]  Then also change clothes and keep yourself clean from grow to grow. If you go to the grow store,
[24:36.240 --> 24:40.160]  if you go to some grow meeting, if you go to a grow class, I would definitely change clothes
[24:40.160 --> 24:45.040]  before you enter your grow environment. And then you also need to think about long-term
[24:45.040 --> 24:49.120]  pest management. We are not going to apply pesticide sprays forever. We're going to get
[24:49.120 --> 24:54.080]  big fat buds. Eventually any pesticide will die off. It will not be effective. Most of them have
[24:54.080 --> 24:58.480]  a very short shelf life unless you're going with something pretty extreme. So you will need to find
[24:58.480 --> 25:05.120]  a better solution. I highly suggest predator mites. I like predator bugs in the grow. One of
[25:05.120 --> 25:11.760]  the most popular pest management instructors has coined the phrase, no bug can build a resistance
[25:11.760 --> 25:17.040]  to being eaten, which is a great statement. If we keep applying pesticides to our pests,
[25:17.040 --> 25:21.440]  they're going to build a resistance to it. If you keep spraying Azimax on your spider mites,
[25:21.440 --> 25:25.920]  you are going to create an Azimax resistant spider mite. They will start drinking it and
[25:25.920 --> 25:31.280]  spitting it back in your face and laughing at you. You need to rotate your pesticides. Once you get
[25:31.280 --> 25:36.640]  into flower, you release those predator mites. And guess what? Nothing has a resistance to being
[25:36.640 --> 25:41.280]  eaten. If you are a little tiny spider mite and a great big hungry predator mite comes by,
[25:41.280 --> 25:46.640]  your food, you're going to die. That's how it goes. So I would suggest switching to predator
[25:46.640 --> 25:52.080]  bugs early in flower, if not late in veg. And here's a little note that I've been talking about
[25:52.080 --> 25:56.480]  just randomly when I'm teaching classes and talking about pest management. I think many
[25:56.480 --> 26:02.400]  people are prioritizing their plants backwards when it comes to pest management. Many people
[26:02.400 --> 26:07.680]  focus on the plants that have the big fat buds that are almost ready for harvest, that are really
[26:07.680 --> 26:12.000]  photogenic, that are beautiful, that management is going to come in and look at. Many people
[26:12.000 --> 26:18.480]  focus on keeping those plants pest free. I recommend starting the other direction. I think
[26:18.480 --> 26:23.120]  that the mother plants and the small clones are the most important plants to keep pest free because
[26:23.120 --> 26:28.160]  that is where everything starts. If you've got to grow that is contaminated, I would start working
[26:28.160 --> 26:33.120]  on the mother plants and the veg plants first. Those plants that are in flower, their numbers
[26:33.200 --> 26:37.760]  are up, their time is counting down. They're going to be cut down and removed from your facility
[26:37.760 --> 26:43.120]  in just a few weeks. Those mother plants, they're there for a much longer time. You've got to deal
[26:43.120 --> 26:48.560]  with them much longer. We need to correct their problems, get them happy, get them healthy because
[26:48.560 --> 26:52.720]  the mother plants are the start of everything. The mother plants are where it all comes from.
[26:52.720 --> 26:56.880]  You need a happy, healthy mother plant so that you can get a happy, healthy clone, so that you can
[26:56.880 --> 27:01.760]  have happy, healthy veg plants, so that we can have happy, healthy flowering plants, so that we can
[27:01.760 --> 27:07.600]  have big, fat, juicy, beautiful, healthy buds, so that in turn we can have happy, healthy patients.
[27:07.600 --> 27:12.320]  So you need happy, healthy mother plants to make that happen. To make all of that happen,
[27:12.320 --> 27:17.280]  you need a happy, healthy, clean, dialed in grow environment. Ladies and gentlemen,
[27:17.280 --> 27:21.360]  I think this was a great podcast episode. I had a lot of fun doing this with very minimal notes.

[29:22.480 --> 29:26.080]  the Grow From Your Heart podcast. Thanks again for listening. I want to give a huge shout out
