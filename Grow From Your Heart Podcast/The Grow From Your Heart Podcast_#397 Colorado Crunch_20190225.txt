[00:00.000 --> 00:04.780]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World. It is time for episode 397 of the Grow From Your
[00:04.780 --> 00:09.920]  Heart Podcast. This episode of the show is brought to you by Oregon Elite Seeds. If you
[00:09.920 --> 00:14.720]  need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds, and you can find them
[00:14.720 --> 00:21.480]  at www.oregoneliteseeds.com. It has become a tradition that we start the
[00:21.480 --> 00:26.880]  podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking. Today, I've been taking dabs of Lemon G Ambrosia
[00:26.880 --> 00:34.560]  from Apothecary Farms. The potency label says this contains 64.4% THC and 74% total
[00:34.560 --> 00:40.640]  cannabinoids. My favorite part about the Lemon G is the disgustingly delicious flavor and
[00:40.640 --> 00:45.720]  aroma. It's gross and delicious all at the same time. It is like Lemon G with armpits
[00:45.720 --> 00:50.360]  and onions on top of it, and for some reason, I really enjoy it.
[00:50.360 --> 00:54.160]  So that's what I'm dabbing on today. I'm smoking the Lemon G Ambrosia from Apothecary
[00:54.160 --> 00:57.720]  Farms. It's got a really nice buzz to it. It's got me nice and talkative. It's got me
[00:57.720 --> 01:03.660]  really chatty. It's got my brain in a nice flow. So this should be a great podcast.
[01:03.660 --> 01:07.920]  This episode is going to be all about what I call the Colorado Crunch. Let's jump right
[01:07.920 --> 01:12.560]  into it. What the hell is the Colorado Crunch? What am I talking about? If you come to Colorado
[01:12.560 --> 01:17.560]  and you shop in a Colorado dispensary, most of the time, you are going to be served what
[01:17.560 --> 01:22.880]  is known as the Colorado Crunch. In the cannabis community around the nation,
[01:22.880 --> 01:28.440]  Colorado is laughed at because most of our product is way too dry. Being in the environment
[01:28.440 --> 01:32.280]  in which we are in, that is hard to prevent. We're at a very high altitude. It is very
[01:32.280 --> 01:36.760]  dry here. There's not a lot of moisture in the air. So of course, all of the buds that
[01:36.760 --> 01:40.920]  are in that environment are going to become dry and crispy.
[01:40.920 --> 01:45.580]  We know that it's happening. We understand. Being a commercial cultivator and somebody
[01:45.580 --> 01:50.480]  who takes pride in my work and takes pride in my final product and wants to deliver the
[01:50.480 --> 01:55.680]  highest quality product to the table, I do understand that the Colorado Crunch can be
[01:55.680 --> 02:00.920]  an issue for a consumer. I also understand how and why it's happening. I see the chain
[02:00.920 --> 02:04.400]  of command that is creating this Colorado Crunch.
[02:04.400 --> 02:08.920]  So let's talk about the Colorado Crunch. What is the Colorado Crunch?
[02:08.920 --> 02:12.800]  Colorado Crunch is what I call it. When you come to Colorado and you shop at one of our
[02:12.800 --> 02:17.160]  dispensaries and you buy your product and you go somewhere safe and you attempt to smoke
[02:17.160 --> 02:20.720]  that product, but when you put it in the grinder and you go to grind it, instead of
[02:20.720 --> 02:26.640]  grinding it into a nice rollable consistency, it basically just turns into a dry, crispy,
[02:26.640 --> 02:30.600]  crunchy powder. That's what I call the Colorado Crunch.
[02:30.600 --> 02:34.360]  In an ideal environment, that herb would be a little bit sticky. It would have a little
[02:34.360 --> 02:37.720]  bit of moisture to it. And when you put it in the grinder, it would feel a little bit
[02:37.720 --> 02:41.280]  sticky as you twist it. And when you take that material out of the grinder, it would
[02:41.280 --> 02:44.840]  stick to your fingers just a little bit. And then as you roll it, it would have a little
[02:44.840 --> 02:49.520]  bit of fluff to it. And then when you went to smoke it, it would have a nice, delicious,
[02:49.520 --> 02:53.760]  smooth, full flavor to it that tasted like a freshly rolled joint.
[02:53.760 --> 03:01.440]  Unfortunately, a lot of what is sold to customers in Colorado is way too dry to be impressive.
[03:01.440 --> 03:06.240]  And again, once your herb gets that dry, it grinds up like shit. It burns up when you
[03:06.240 --> 03:11.120]  try to smoke it. And also, it doesn't taste very good. You have dried out all of the turps,
[03:11.120 --> 03:15.240]  all of the flavor is gone. And now instead of smoking what could have been connoisseur
[03:15.240 --> 03:19.760]  quality product, you're now just smoking a 7 out of a 10.
[03:19.760 --> 03:24.680]  Now being the lead cultivator, I would like to deliver a 10 to the shelf. I'm not satisfied
[03:24.680 --> 03:31.720]  with putting 70% of my quality out there. I want 100% of the quality. My name, my face,
[03:31.720 --> 03:36.760]  and my reputation are on the line when it comes to that product. A lot of people know
[03:36.880 --> 03:42.160]  which grows and which dispensaries I am affiliated with, and they will shop at those stores just
[03:42.160 --> 03:46.520]  because they know I grew that product. So it's embarrassing to me to know that we're
[03:46.520 --> 03:53.120]  putting out 70% of what we could be doing. I would like to deliver a 100% top shelf quality
[03:53.120 --> 03:55.360]  product to the consumers.
[03:55.360 --> 03:59.640]  So now I want to talk a little bit about what happens to the product from the time it leaves
[03:59.640 --> 04:05.600]  the commercial cultivation facility to the time it finally reaches the end consumer.
[04:05.600 --> 04:11.280]  In most large commercial cultivation facilities, there is a person in charge of drying and
[04:11.280 --> 04:16.720]  curing the finished product. It is that person's duty to make sure that product is dried and
[04:16.720 --> 04:21.240]  cured properly and that it never becomes too dry. On the other side of that token, part
[04:21.240 --> 04:25.680]  of their job is also to make sure that herb doesn't stay wet too long and stay sealed
[04:25.680 --> 04:30.580]  in a container too long and become moldy or funky and ruin the aroma and flavor. So they
[04:30.580 --> 04:36.380]  have a lot of responsibilities. One of their big responsibilities is to maintain correct
[04:36.380 --> 04:38.960]  moisture of finished product.
[04:38.960 --> 04:44.300]  In the facilities which I operate, we do that by keeping a dehumidifier running constantly
[04:44.300 --> 04:49.820]  and a humidifier running constantly, and we set them both at 50% and we seal a room and
[04:49.820 --> 04:56.080]  we let them battle it out at all times. So that room is constantly at 50% humidity, which
[04:56.080 --> 05:01.240]  keeps our buds at a perfect moisture level. Now, depending on how much product there is,
[05:01.240 --> 05:05.880]  the buds will be kept in different size containers. When there is a lot, we use very large, like
[05:05.880 --> 05:10.840]  rubber made storage containers. Once we get down to smaller batches, we use smaller containers.
[05:10.840 --> 05:15.140]  Once we get down to the pound level, we start using turkey bags actually, and we seal the
[05:15.140 --> 05:20.880]  turkey bags up and those turkey bags and all of those packages are still kept in that room,
[05:20.880 --> 05:25.340]  which is maintained at 50% relative humidity at all times.
[05:25.340 --> 05:30.660]  So while any flower is in my possession in any facility in which I am responsible for,
[05:30.660 --> 05:35.980]  we are very careful to maintain the correct humidity and moisture levels of our flowers
[05:35.980 --> 05:41.180]  at all times. Now, a lot of people may say that herb is going to sit there in that dry
[05:41.180 --> 05:47.340]  and cure room for a long time and it's just going to get funky waiting, but that is inaccurate.
[05:47.340 --> 05:51.500]  At this point in time, cannabis is in high demand, recreationally and medically, there
[05:51.500 --> 05:56.700]  is a high demand for quality flowers. As soon as I determine the flowers are ready
[05:56.700 --> 06:01.740]  for the shelf, the store will take it. They want that delivery immediately. So the flower
[06:01.740 --> 06:07.020]  is not sitting around at all. First off, we don't have any space to store bulk flower
[06:07.020 --> 06:11.340]  in most commercial facilities. We just need it out of there. Second of all, it's in high
[06:11.340 --> 06:16.260]  demand. There is no backstock at the store. They need to get that product from us to the
[06:16.260 --> 06:20.980]  store on the shelf to the consumer in a pipe and keep the cycle moving. So there is no
[06:20.980 --> 06:25.380]  backstock. It's not sitting around getting dry. There's no opportunity for that. As soon
[06:25.380 --> 06:30.100]  as we harvest a crop, it is basically sold. And then all of the trim material is immediately
[06:30.100 --> 06:34.960]  sent off to a concentrate company to be turned into concentrates. We don't sit on anything.
[06:34.960 --> 06:37.540]  We need quick returns in this industry.
[06:37.540 --> 06:41.900]  So why is the bud crunchy? We still haven't gotten to that part. At some point, this product
[06:41.900 --> 06:46.180]  has to leave my custody. It has got to leave the commercial cultivation facility where
[06:46.180 --> 06:50.780]  it is kept in that controlled environment at all times. It is transferred to the retail
[06:50.780 --> 06:56.540]  location and that is where I feel the problem begins. Most of the time, the dispensary will
[06:56.540 --> 07:00.140]  place an order from the commercial grow. They'll say, hey, we see you've got this in stock
[07:00.140 --> 07:04.480]  on your spreadsheet because I keep a spreadsheet of my entire inventory. And they'll say, hey,
[07:04.480 --> 07:08.020]  we need this much. We'll say golden goat. For this conversation, we're going to say
[07:08.020 --> 07:12.020]  they just ordered two pounds of golden goat. Send us two pounds of golden goat with the
[07:12.020 --> 07:14.740]  next order. There's going to be more stuff in that order, but we're going to stick with
[07:14.740 --> 07:17.120]  the golden goat for this conversation.
[07:17.120 --> 07:21.040]  So at this point, the person in charge of the product in our facility will weigh two
[07:21.040 --> 07:24.700]  pounds of golden goat. They'll package it up. They'll give it a package number. It'll
[07:24.700 --> 07:28.360]  be all marked. It'll be all sealed up. It'll be ready to go. That will go with the delivery.
[07:28.360 --> 07:33.740]  So that gets taken to the store. Now it is at a store without a controlled environment.
[07:33.740 --> 07:38.980]  You were just in the store environment. It's probably whatever it is in the room, 77, 78
[07:38.980 --> 07:43.700]  degrees, whatever ambient humidity you've got in that dispensary. That's what it is.
[07:43.700 --> 07:47.780]  That's where that product is now stored. It is probably in a back stock room, just
[07:47.780 --> 07:52.180]  chilling out on a shelf. Who knows if the bud tender or whoever is responsible for the
[07:52.180 --> 07:56.620]  product there knows that they need to reseal that bag when they're done pulling out whatever
[07:56.620 --> 08:00.500]  they need. Who knows where it is stored? Is it sitting right by the heater? Is it sitting
[08:00.500 --> 08:05.580]  right by the air conditioner? I have no idea, nor do I have any control over what happens
[08:05.580 --> 08:10.420]  to this product once it has entered the dispensary and it has left my custody.
[08:10.420 --> 08:13.700]  Now earlier I did mention that there's not much back stock and that we're not hanging
[08:13.700 --> 08:18.560]  on to a lot of product. We do deliver enough product to last about a week so we don't have
[08:18.560 --> 08:23.300]  to keep making deliveries every day. So there will be a little bit of excess product in
[08:23.300 --> 08:27.380]  the store. There is probably that bag of two pounds of golden goat sitting somewhere in
[08:27.380 --> 08:32.700]  the stock room. Now what will happen is an employee will get the jar that is on display.
[08:32.700 --> 08:36.780]  It will take that to the stock room and they will fill it up with as much golden goat fits
[08:36.780 --> 08:41.260]  in that jar. For the sake of this conversation, we're going to say that jar probably holds
[08:41.260 --> 08:45.660]  two ounces. So they're going to pull out of that 32 ounce bag I just sent them. They're
[08:45.660 --> 08:50.840]  going to pull two ounces and put that in a jar. That jar is now going to go on display.
[08:50.840 --> 08:55.780]  Like we said earlier, who knows what happens to that big two pound surplus bag? Did they
[08:55.780 --> 09:00.340]  seal it back up? Did they leave it wide open? I don't know. That's where the problem of
[09:00.340 --> 09:02.860]  the Colorado Crunch begins.
[09:02.940 --> 09:07.660]  So at this point, we've got the big bulk bag. It's got about 30 ounces remaining in it.
[09:07.660 --> 09:11.480]  That's in a store room somewhere that I can't see. I don't have access to. I have no idea
[09:11.480 --> 09:15.860]  what's going on. That is where the Colorado Crunch is beginning. Now let's talk about
[09:15.860 --> 09:20.700]  this display jar. They've pulled out two ounces and it is on display. It's on the top shelf.
[09:20.700 --> 09:24.960]  It says golden goat. Shoppers are going to come in all day and they're going to see the
[09:24.960 --> 09:30.020]  golden goat. Now here's what happens in a dispensary. You walk in, you look at the jars,
[09:30.020 --> 09:34.700]  you see the labels, something gets your attention, and then you start by saying, can I smell
[09:34.700 --> 09:39.380]  the whatever? And you pick a jar. In this conversation, I'm going with my golden goat.
[09:39.380 --> 09:43.060]  The bud tender will turn around, grab the jar, get the golden goat off the jar or off
[09:43.060 --> 09:48.260]  the shelf. Then they will pop the lid of that jar and let you smell it. Now it depends on
[09:48.260 --> 09:54.120]  how busy your specific dispensary is, but imagine how many times in one day that jar
[09:54.120 --> 09:58.860]  is going to be opened and closed. So here's what happens. You close the jar. There's a
[09:58.860 --> 10:02.420]  little bit of moisture in that bud. There should be moisture in the bud. We want that.
[10:02.420 --> 10:07.060]  That is properly dried and cured. We've got some moisture in there. When we seal it up,
[10:07.060 --> 10:11.580]  that moisture starts to move around. It wants to even itself out. It wants to redistribute
[10:11.580 --> 10:15.580]  all through that jar. So if you've got one bud in there that's kind of wet and one bud
[10:15.580 --> 10:18.740]  that's not, they're going to kind of even each other out inside the jar. The moisture
[10:18.740 --> 10:23.380]  is going to move around. That moisture will also be in the air inside the jar. It will
[10:23.380 --> 10:27.940]  be moving around in the environment, in the atmosphere, in the jar. We crack open the
[10:27.940 --> 10:32.460]  lid. Now guess what happens? All the moisture goes flying right out of the jar. You stick
[10:32.460 --> 10:36.300]  it up to the customer's nose. They give it a smell. I'll take an eighth of that. The
[10:36.300 --> 10:40.860]  bud tender pulls out an eighth, 3.5 grams, throw it into a little container, seal it
[10:40.860 --> 10:45.540]  up, put the lid back on the jar, put the jar back on the shelf, ask you what else you'd
[10:45.540 --> 10:52.500]  like. Now that process happens to that jar over and over and over again all day if they
[10:52.500 --> 10:57.180]  shop from it or not. They may choose not to even buy that. So it got opened. It got that
[10:57.180 --> 11:01.060]  cycle. It got the moisture built up. It got cracked open. It let the moisture out. Then
[11:01.060 --> 11:05.900]  it got resealed so it can repeat the process. And that happens all day, every day until
[11:05.900 --> 11:10.420]  all of that product is sold. Now something that dispensaries like to do, it looks way
[11:10.420 --> 11:14.900]  better to have full jars. It's just more appealing. It looks better on the shelf. As a retail
[11:14.900 --> 11:20.100]  manager, we like to see full jars instead of half empty jars. So when that jar starts
[11:20.100 --> 11:24.740]  to look a little empty, about halfway, most retail managers will send a bud tender to
[11:24.740 --> 11:29.620]  refill that jar so it looks like you've got big, full, fresh jars and it looks like you've
[11:29.620 --> 11:33.860]  got a lot of product and it's more inviting. Now what happened to that product on the bottom?
[11:33.860 --> 11:38.220]  It is still on the bottom. It's been getting opened and closed for even longer now and
[11:38.220 --> 11:43.100]  it's just going to continue to sit there on the bottom. So that is a lot of what is contributing
[11:43.100 --> 11:50.140]  to the Colorado Crunch. I feel like I try very hard to prevent crunchy herb in the commercial
[11:50.140 --> 11:55.260]  grow environment. It is hard. We have to maintain a perfect environment in a very large
[11:55.260 --> 12:00.620]  room. It does require a little bit of equipment and it requires a lot of attention to detail,
[12:00.620 --> 12:06.460]  but I feel like I do a very good job at delivering a properly dried and cured product. I'm not
[12:06.460 --> 12:11.900]  trying to pass the buck, but I feel many commercial cultivators take as much pride in their product
[12:11.900 --> 12:17.100]  as I do. And I feel like this Colorado Crunch is happening after the product leaves the
[12:17.100 --> 12:22.540]  custody of the grower at the facility. I feel like it is happening in the back of the store
[12:22.540 --> 12:27.500]  and it is greatly happening because of that jar being opened and closed all day.
[12:28.140 --> 12:32.780]  So that is my explanation of the Colorado Crunch. I understand that it's happening.
[12:32.780 --> 12:36.300]  It's not something that I can fix. It's not something I can do anything about,
[12:36.300 --> 12:40.860]  but I hope I taught you guys about the Colorado Crunch. I hope you understand what the crunch is
[12:40.860 --> 12:44.860]  and I hope you understand why it's happening. And I hope you see that I understand that it's
[12:44.860 --> 12:51.980]  an issue, but also understand that it is beyond my control. Now I do have a solution to the
[12:51.980 --> 12:57.260]  Colorado Crunch. What type of podcaster would I be? What kind of commercial consultant would I be
[12:57.260 --> 13:02.220]  if I just came and told you about a problem, but I did not offer any type of solution. I do have
[13:02.220 --> 13:09.020]  what I feel is a good solution, but what I have noticed is consumers do not like this idea. In my
[13:09.020 --> 13:15.260]  opinion, the solution to the Colorado Crunch is pre-weighed and pre-packaged products. If we had
[13:15.260 --> 13:19.660]  everything pre-weighed and pre-packaged, we wouldn't be opening that big jar all day, every
[13:19.660 --> 13:25.740]  day, and we would be able to maintain the proper dry and cure moisture level that we desire in
[13:25.740 --> 13:31.740]  that stock. My ideal scenario would be that we've got a small jar of each offering available on the
[13:31.740 --> 13:35.820]  counter that you can look at at your own leisure. You can just grab the jar, pop the lid, give it
[13:35.820 --> 13:40.460]  a smell, and if you want an eighth of that, let me know. All I've got to do is turn around and grab
[13:40.460 --> 13:45.820]  a pre-packaged eighth off of the shelf and hand it to you. That would be advantageous in a couple
[13:45.820 --> 13:50.940]  of ways. First off, it would save bud tenders time. The bud tender wouldn't have to weigh out
[13:50.940 --> 13:55.500]  your eighth while you're standing there staring at me, and I've got a line of customers behind you
[13:55.500 --> 13:59.260]  that also would like to get an eighth. So a pre-weighed eighth would make it quicker. You say,
[13:59.260 --> 14:04.540]  I want golden goat. I reach back, golden goat, bro, ready to go. Also, it's in a container. It
[14:04.540 --> 14:11.020]  is sealed. A lot of companies offer nitrogen-sealed cannabis in a container. Some people are against
[14:11.020 --> 14:16.060]  that. Some people are all about it. I don't see any problem with it because it keeps the herb
[14:16.060 --> 14:21.740]  deliciously fresh. It doesn't get too dry in that container. It doesn't get funky in that container,
[14:21.740 --> 14:27.180]  and it is just as good as it was when the grower sealed it up when he felt it was perfectly dried
[14:27.180 --> 14:32.620]  and cured. So I think a pre-weighed product is the way to go. Now, the reason a lot of people don't
[14:32.620 --> 14:37.180]  like the pre-weighed product is because they are old school, and they don't trust the person who
[14:37.180 --> 14:42.780]  is selling them their cannabis. You guys, this is a retail environment. We're going to be there
[14:42.780 --> 14:47.820]  tomorrow. We paid a lot of money for all of our licensing. We've got a reputation to uphold.
[14:47.820 --> 14:54.940]  Our name of our business is on a sign out front of the building. There's no need to sell anybody
[14:54.940 --> 15:01.180]  a short bag in the legal cannabis industry. Your bag is going to weigh. Your product will be what
[15:01.180 --> 15:07.420]  you expected it to be, even if it was pre-weighed before you came in. There is a packaging department.
[15:07.420 --> 15:12.860]  We hire competent people to work in the packaging department. Their only job is to weigh eights all
[15:12.860 --> 15:17.580]  day. They put those eights in the container. They seal it up, put a sticker on it, put it in the bin.
[15:17.580 --> 15:21.340]  At the end of the day, all of those eights are delivered to the store, and those are what would
[15:21.340 --> 15:26.140]  be sold to you. Some dispensaries are doing that now. In California, it is the common practice.
[15:26.940 --> 15:32.300]  In California, you don't hear about the California crunch. I think that pre-packaged eights and
[15:32.300 --> 15:36.540]  quarters would be the way to go for the future to prevent the Colorado crunch.
[15:37.420 --> 15:42.140]  I think over time, consumers will become more comfortable with being given a pre-weighed eighth.
[15:42.700 --> 15:47.980]  I think now a lot of people still probably get their package from the dispensary, and a lot of
[15:47.980 --> 15:53.020]  people probably drive home and dump their package right on a scale to make sure that it weighs.
[15:53.020 --> 15:57.340]  I'm sure that all of those packages that you're getting from a dispensary, I'm certain that they
[15:57.340 --> 16:05.340]  all weigh. Look at it this way. Most bud tenders are hourly employees that also get tips. If they
[16:05.340 --> 16:09.740]  give you good service and give you a nice eighth, there's a good chance that when you get home and
[16:09.740 --> 16:14.780]  see that nice eighth, the next time you come back to shop, you're going to give them a better tip.
[16:14.780 --> 16:21.020]  Now, they have no incentive to give you a short bag because the product is owned by the dispensary.
[16:21.020 --> 16:24.540]  It is not their product. The only reason they would want to short you is because they don't
[16:24.540 --> 16:29.420]  want to sell all of their weed. If they short you half a gram here, half a gram there, they can sell
[16:29.420 --> 16:33.180]  a few more grams, make a little bit more money. It's not street dealing. They're not going to make
[16:33.180 --> 16:38.300]  any money. That product, again, belongs to the dispensary. They are an hourly employee.
[16:38.300 --> 16:41.980]  So if they don't put that half a gram or whatever you think they're going to rip you off into your
[16:41.980 --> 16:45.740]  container, they don't make anything off of it. So they want to give you your product.
[16:45.740 --> 16:49.660]  They want you to come back. They want you to keep shopping there. They want to develop a
[16:49.660 --> 16:54.700]  relationship with you and they want you to start giving them fatter tips. So don't think that the
[16:54.700 --> 16:58.620]  dispensary is going to short you. You guys, I got to press pause for one second because I'm going to
[16:58.620 --> 17:04.060]  sneeze. All right, podcast world, after a nice little sneeze fit and a couple of dabs, I am back.
[17:04.060 --> 17:08.620]  Excuse me for that. I hope you couldn't hear that sneeze in my voice for too long. I could feel that
[17:08.620 --> 17:13.500]  it was coming, but we all know that if I cut myself off, I will never remember what I was
[17:13.500 --> 17:18.220]  saying. So I was just trying to get my thought out before I pressed pause. Anyway, we are back,
[17:18.220 --> 17:22.780]  nicely medicated, ready to keep rambling. I was talking about the Colorado Crunch,
[17:22.780 --> 17:27.500]  and I was encouraging you to not be afraid of a pre-packaged product.
[17:28.140 --> 17:33.340]  All right, podcast world, the next thing I want to talk about is pre-rolls. Quite often, I hear
[17:33.340 --> 17:37.580]  people complaining about the quality of the pre-rolls they are buying from their local
[17:37.580 --> 17:43.500]  dispensaries. You can probably walk in and buy a joint for about $5. Really convenient if you're
[17:43.500 --> 17:47.500]  just hanging out, going somewhere and want to get stoned. That's a really easy way to do it.
[17:48.140 --> 17:53.020]  But quite often, I hear people complain about the quality of the pre-roll.
[17:53.020 --> 17:57.500]  And something that really breaks my heart is when somebody tells me that they tried a new strain,
[17:57.500 --> 18:01.900]  perhaps something I bred, or perhaps something they think I may have grown, and they tell me
[18:01.900 --> 18:06.940]  that they did not like the pre-roll. I often feel like if they would have purchased a gram or maybe
[18:06.940 --> 18:11.500]  an eighth, they would have gotten a much better representation of the quality of the product that
[18:11.500 --> 18:16.460]  I intended to produce. Now let's talk about pre-rolls and why people complain about them.
[18:18.060 --> 18:22.940]  Remember earlier I was talking about that display jar that we open and close all day and we just
[18:22.940 --> 18:27.740]  keep topping it off with fresh bud? Well that stuff at the bottom gets really dry, it gets
[18:27.740 --> 18:31.580]  really crunchy. That's where all the bottom popcorn buds go. It's where all the stuff that
[18:31.580 --> 18:37.740]  nobody really wants to purchase ends up. So all that super dry, super crunchy, super tiny shit
[18:37.740 --> 18:43.740]  all ends up in your pre-rolls. When the dispensary is slow and the bud tender doesn't have anything
[18:43.740 --> 18:49.660]  to do, they'll grab that jar of bottom, dried up, crunchy popcorn buds and they'll pour it into a
[18:49.660 --> 18:55.260]  colander or a strainer and they'll use that to clean it up. They crunch it up real fine and real
[18:55.260 --> 19:01.260]  small so that the buds fit through the colander or the strainer and all of the stems and the junk
[19:01.260 --> 19:07.500]  stay in the strainer so it can be thrown away. Then that fine, dusty, crunchy material is used
[19:07.500 --> 19:12.940]  to roll all of the pre-rolls that go on the shelf. So the next time somebody complains about a pre-roll,
[19:12.940 --> 19:18.300]  just remember it's because you are buying the very bottom of the barrel, literally, and it is
[19:18.300 --> 19:24.380]  also the cheapest item on the menu. So if you really want a good representation of a strain,
[19:24.380 --> 19:30.460]  don't buy the pre-roll if it's available. A lot of dispensaries offer strain-specific pre-rolls,
[19:30.460 --> 19:34.380]  meaning you can go in and look at the menu and get a Golden Goat pre-roll, maybe you can get a
[19:34.380 --> 19:39.340]  Lemon Jeffrey pre-roll. Even if it's a Lemon Jeffrey or a Golden Goat, I still suggest you
[19:39.340 --> 19:44.460]  get a gram or two and roll it up yourself. So that is my rant on pre-rolls. The next thing I
[19:44.460 --> 19:51.740]  want to bash is caviar or whatever they call it in your dispensary. It is really popular for people
[19:51.740 --> 19:58.460]  to take buds, small buds, like one gram size buds, and then they roll it around in what they call
[19:58.460 --> 20:04.620]  honey oil. It's butane honey oil, BHO. Then once it's rolled around in the BHO and it's nice and
[20:04.620 --> 20:11.500]  sticky, they coat it in keef. To be quite honest with you, I am always very suspect of caviar.
[20:12.060 --> 20:16.700]  First, why did you want to hide your bud? I want to know why they hid the bud. I want to see the
[20:16.700 --> 20:21.020]  bud that's in there. Why did they want to cover that up? Most people want to show off their work.
[20:21.020 --> 20:25.740]  Why are you hiding the buds? I think there's something to hide. That's my first suspicion.
[20:25.740 --> 20:31.500]  Second of all, why did you hide the oil? You rolled it in oil and made it nice and sticky.
[20:31.500 --> 20:35.660]  It makes me question the consistency and the quality of your oil, first of all.
[20:35.660 --> 20:41.100]  Then you coated that oil in keef. It just seems like you had a bunch of shit that wasn't really
[20:41.100 --> 20:45.980]  up to par and you thought you could take three low-grade products and combine them and actually
[20:45.980 --> 20:51.740]  make one high-grade product. Honestly, I'm just not buying it. I am always very suspicious of
[20:51.740 --> 20:56.220]  the caviar. I think that's three products that were all problematic that were just combined
[20:56.220 --> 21:00.460]  and put into one product so they could put it on the shelf and get a little bit of return
[21:00.460 --> 21:05.420]  on an investment. That's just my opinion on the moon rocks and caviar. I've never been really
[21:05.420 --> 21:10.060]  impressed by it. I've always found it a pain in the ass to work with. Again, when you hide your
[21:10.060 --> 21:14.540]  buds, I immediately wonder what you're hiding. What's wrong with the quality of the flour?
[21:14.540 --> 21:18.380]  What's wrong with the quality of the oil? Why did you put a bunch of keef over all of it
[21:18.380 --> 21:22.940]  to hide it all from me? All right, podcast rule. That is enough bashing products. I just bashed
[21:22.940 --> 21:27.500]  pre-rolls and I bashed caviar pretty hard. I try not to be Negative Nancy on the podcast,
[21:27.500 --> 21:32.300]  but that's just my opinion. I wanted to give you a heads up as a consumer. I feel like it is partly
[21:32.300 --> 21:37.180]  my responsibility to look out for the consumers. I've got one more quick thing I want to talk
[21:37.180 --> 21:41.740]  about since I'm looking out for people. Let's look out for the people who work in the grows
[21:41.740 --> 21:47.420]  and in the dispensaries. Here's a quick rant that I've wanted to share. If you work in the legal
[21:47.420 --> 21:54.060]  cannabis industry, I highly suggest that you look into the rules, the laws, and regulations
[21:54.060 --> 21:59.980]  involving your position. Make sure you are not doing anything that can put yourself in
[21:59.980 --> 22:08.940]  legal jeopardy. Unfortunately, if you do break the law at work under somebody else's direction,
[22:09.900 --> 22:16.700]  you can still be arrested for a crime. Here's an example. Maybe you're a bud tender and you
[22:16.700 --> 22:21.660]  accidentally sell product to somebody with an invalid license. Here's the scenario.
[22:21.660 --> 22:26.380]  A customer walks in, they hand their driver's license to the person at the door. They're a
[22:26.380 --> 22:31.580]  familiar customer. They've been there before. The person at the door looks at the ID really quickly.
[22:31.580 --> 22:36.460]  The picture looks right. Says, Bill, that's Bill. Here's your ID back, Bill. I'll buzz you in. Go
[22:36.460 --> 22:41.260]  into the bud room. Do your shopping. So Bill walks into the bud room. You as a bud tender,
[22:41.260 --> 22:45.580]  you say, Hey Bill, how's it going? Because you know Bill. Bill has been there frequently. You
[22:45.580 --> 22:50.700]  already know what Bill is going to buy. He comes there so often. So you say, the usual Bill? And
[22:50.700 --> 22:55.980]  he says, Yes ma'am or yes sir. And you serve Bill right up. You give Bill product. You take Bill's
[22:55.980 --> 23:01.580]  money. Bill leaves. You may have just committed a crime because you did not check Bill's ID
[23:01.580 --> 23:09.100]  yourself. You need to make sure that Bill's ID is valid. If that ID is expired or invalid for any
[23:09.100 --> 23:15.660]  reason, you just made an illegal cannabis sale and you can be arrested and charged with a crime.
[23:16.220 --> 23:22.380]  Now that sounds like a very minor infraction, a very small detail at work, but it is a very
[23:22.380 --> 23:27.260]  serious matter, which is why I felt like, again, it was my responsibility to make sure you are
[23:27.260 --> 23:34.060]  aware that you can be arrested and charged with a crime if you make a mistake in the cannabis
[23:34.060 --> 23:40.700]  industry. And this applies for almost any position in the industry. Anybody in the industry from an
[23:40.700 --> 23:45.660]  hourly paid bud tender all the way up to a salaried dispensary owner can be charged with
[23:45.660 --> 23:51.740]  a crime if they are found to be breaking the law. So if you work in the industry, I highly suggest
[23:51.740 --> 23:57.340]  you learn all of the rules, all of the laws, and all the regulations around your position.
[23:57.340 --> 24:02.460]  If you are a bud tender, get very familiar with which forms of ID are acceptable.
[24:02.460 --> 24:08.620]  If you are a bud tender, get very familiar with transaction limits. Small details like that can
[24:08.620 --> 24:13.260]  really keep you out of trouble, and it is your responsibility. We would like to think that that
[24:13.260 --> 24:18.140]  responsibility falls on the dispensary owner or your boss or whoever you'd like to call that person,
[24:18.140 --> 24:22.780]  but it is not their job. When you got that marijuana enforcement division badge,
[24:22.780 --> 24:26.700]  you signed up and said, I know the rules and I'm willing to play by your rules.
[24:26.700 --> 24:32.860]  And at that point, it is your responsibility to know those rules. So again, learn the rules,
[24:32.860 --> 24:36.700]  learn the laws, do a little bit of reading, and keep yourself out of trouble.
[24:36.700 --> 24:41.580]  If you have any questions in the state of Colorado, we have got the marijuana enforcement
[24:41.580 --> 24:46.620]  division and metric at your fingertips to help you out. They want to keep you out of trouble.
[24:46.620 --> 24:51.180]  They want to keep you compliant. Reach out to them. They're very easy to get a hold of.
[24:51.180 --> 24:57.180]  Also, many facilities have a compliance officer. A compliance officer should have most of the
[24:57.180 --> 25:02.060]  answers to all of your questions, and if not, they should be familiar enough with the rules
[25:02.060 --> 25:05.660]  to where they can skim right through the rule book and get to the section that applies to what
[25:05.660 --> 25:10.300]  you're asking, and they should be able to answer you in just a few hours. I'm not sure the rules,
[25:10.300 --> 25:16.220]  the setup, the laws in your state, but again, it is your responsibility to keep yourself safe
[25:16.220 --> 25:20.940]  at work. Do not commit a crime while trying to feed yourself and your family. We have turned
[25:20.940 --> 25:26.140]  this into a legal market. Let's do our best to stay out of trouble while in the legal market.
[25:27.020 --> 25:31.420]  All right, Podcast World, that is all I've got for you for episode number 397. I want to thank

[25:39.340 --> 25:45.260]  couple of grams instead. Get that real flavor. Get the actual quality. Ladies and gentlemen, if you
