[00:00.250 --> 00:14.660]  Welcome back podcast world.
[00:14.660 --> 00:15.660]  I'm your host.
[00:15.660 --> 00:20.420]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff and it is time for episode 585 of the Grow From Your Heart
[00:20.420 --> 00:21.420]  podcast.
[00:21.420 --> 00:24.900]  You know I like to start the show off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:24.900 --> 00:28.740]  Today I've been taking dabs of OG Lime Killer Live Batter.
[00:28.740 --> 00:31.740]  I think it smells like limes and Gatorade powder.
[00:31.740 --> 00:33.620]  It's got a really nice head buzz to it.
[00:33.620 --> 00:36.940]  It's got me talking kind of fast and it's got my brain moving quite quickly.
[00:37.020 --> 00:40.580]  So this should make perfect podcast concentrates.
[00:40.580 --> 00:44.940]  So big shout out to the OG Lime Killer Live Batter.
[00:44.940 --> 00:48.220]  In this episode I'm going to read a couple of Patreon messages.
[00:48.220 --> 00:52.180]  Before we get there let's do a few shout outs to a few members of the 710 Club.
[00:52.180 --> 00:57.980]  Of course the 710 Club are the folks who support us on Patreon at the $7.10 a month level or
[00:57.980 --> 00:58.980]  higher.
[00:58.980 --> 01:02.660]  So with no further ado let's start off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:02.660 --> 01:05.980]  Thank you shout out to our friend Mr. Let's follow that one up with a shout out to our
[01:05.980 --> 01:06.980]  buddy Jeffrey.
[01:06.980 --> 01:10.820]  I want to send a special thank you shout out to I want to talk to Samson.
[01:10.820 --> 01:12.900]  Let's follow that up with a Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:12.900 --> 01:15.680]  Thank you shout out to Oh Cannabis 613.
[01:15.680 --> 01:18.180]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Yannick Bucci.
[01:18.180 --> 01:22.060]  If I said that incorrectly send me an email and I will say it correctly the next time
[01:22.060 --> 01:23.600]  I give you a shout out.
[01:23.600 --> 01:26.000]  Let's follow that up with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:26.000 --> 01:27.660]  Thank you shout out to Froggle Rock.
[01:27.660 --> 01:29.980]  I want to send a thank you shout out to Lernon and Burnin.
[01:29.980 --> 01:33.420]  I've always got a special thank you shout out to Just a Smokin.
[01:33.420 --> 01:38.020]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Xavier C. And last but certainly not least let's
[01:38.020 --> 01:40.360]  send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:40.360 --> 01:45.640]  Thank you shout out to our friend ADHD Grower.
[01:45.640 --> 01:48.560]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who supports the show.
[01:48.560 --> 01:52.340]  If you are not supporting the show on Patreon and you would like to learn how to do so all
[01:52.340 --> 01:58.620]  you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:58.620 --> 02:01.180]  All the information you need on will be right there on the screen.
[02:01.180 --> 02:05.100]  And of course I did include a link in the show notes and in the video description to
[02:05.100 --> 02:09.300]  make it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[02:09.300 --> 02:13.340]  Also ladies and gentlemen I do invite you and encourage you to check out the new updated
[02:13.340 --> 02:14.340]  website.
[02:14.340 --> 02:18.020]  I do keep saying that the website is updated and improved on every episode.
[02:18.020 --> 02:21.700]  I think we are almost complete with the upgrades, the updates.
[02:21.700 --> 02:26.480]  iRegenetics.com and iRegeneticsColorado.com are all updated.
[02:26.480 --> 02:30.460]  The only thing we need to do is add a few more strain descriptions, add a few more strain
[02:30.460 --> 02:32.860]  photos, update a few of those things.
[02:32.860 --> 02:33.860]  Everything will be up to speed.
[02:33.860 --> 02:37.940]  I will add more strains over time but I am proud of what we've got up there.
[02:37.940 --> 02:40.020]  Big shout out to my friend who helped me with the new web design.
[02:40.020 --> 02:42.280]  I do appreciate the help.
[02:42.280 --> 02:46.020]  Big shout out to everybody who has sent me feedback and encouragement on the new website.
[02:46.020 --> 02:47.580]  I do appreciate it.
[02:47.580 --> 02:51.900]  There's more stuff coming soon so by the time you hear this we should be upgraded but if
[02:51.900 --> 02:54.860]  there's a strain you're curious about on there please take a look.
[02:54.860 --> 02:59.700]  So if you're interested in anything iRegenetics, if it's iRegenetics seeds, the Grow From Your
[02:59.700 --> 03:04.140]  Heart podcast, if you're looking for my social media, if you need to contact me, everything
[03:04.140 --> 03:07.820]  is right there at iRegenetics.com.
[03:07.820 --> 03:09.180]  Please do take a look.
[03:09.180 --> 03:12.660]  Also there are more shirts and hoodies on the website.
[03:12.660 --> 03:16.900]  That's right I have added pink and gray Arise t-shirts and hoodies.
[03:16.900 --> 03:21.460]  You get a pink t-shirt or a pink hoodie or a gray t-shirt or a gray hoodie.
[03:21.460 --> 03:24.380]  Grab them quickly because some of the sizes already sold out.
[03:24.380 --> 03:26.140]  I had to replenish them.
[03:26.140 --> 03:27.620]  Some of those already sold out again.
[03:27.620 --> 03:32.260]  So go quickly, grab your t-shirts and hoodies before they sell out.
[03:32.260 --> 03:34.420]  All right that is enough chatter here at the start of the show.
[03:34.420 --> 03:37.140]  Let's jump into a few Patreon messages.
[03:37.140 --> 03:38.860]  I've got a great message here right in front of me.
[03:38.860 --> 03:40.580]  This one comes from our friend Krios.
[03:40.580 --> 03:41.580]  What's up Krios?
[03:41.580 --> 03:42.580]  Good to hear from you bro.
[03:42.580 --> 03:44.460]  I love picking on you, making fun of your name.
[03:44.460 --> 03:46.360]  That's all in love and respect.
[03:46.360 --> 03:48.300]  This message goes just like this.
[03:48.300 --> 03:51.180]  It's a full moon so I just flipped to flower.
[03:51.180 --> 03:52.180]  I like that.
[03:52.180 --> 03:54.500]  A lot of people follow the full moon for their flowering cycles.
[03:54.500 --> 03:55.860]  I can respect that.
[03:55.860 --> 04:00.140]  It goes on to say, I probably F'd that up by taking pictures just now.
[04:00.140 --> 04:01.140]  That's funny.
[04:01.140 --> 04:04.260]  You turned it to 1212, the lights went off and you realized I should take some pictures
[04:04.260 --> 04:05.260]  in the dark.
[04:05.260 --> 04:07.180]  If it was the first day, that's not a big deal.
[04:07.180 --> 04:09.780]  And it says it was day one so no worries there.
[04:09.780 --> 04:13.580]  It goes on to say, the big one is a rise, the shorter one is morning dew.
[04:13.580 --> 04:16.940]  I probably need to make the canopy more even for flower.
[04:16.940 --> 04:19.540]  Flower picks in 63 to 70 days.
[04:19.540 --> 04:21.300]  So he's sent me some vegetative pictures.
[04:21.300 --> 04:24.060]  I did not save them to show them to you guys.
[04:24.060 --> 04:28.500]  But we've got the important part of the email and I look forward to seeing flower picks
[04:28.500 --> 04:30.100]  in 63 to 70 days.
[04:30.100 --> 04:31.420]  Don't wait 63.
[04:31.420 --> 04:32.580]  Catch me around week six.
[04:32.580 --> 04:34.080]  That's when the photos start getting really good.
[04:34.080 --> 04:35.860]  So snap some photos then.
[04:35.860 --> 04:37.140]  Anyway, there is a lot to this.
[04:37.140 --> 04:38.420]  It says, thank you for the reply.
[04:38.420 --> 04:41.060]  I was just about to send you an email with some questions.
[04:41.060 --> 04:42.860]  Here's the great part of the message.
[04:42.860 --> 04:47.860]  It says, with your new LEDs, do you notice it takes less time to finish?
[04:47.860 --> 04:50.900]  So I'm sure if you've been paying attention to the show, you know that I've started growing
[04:51.020 --> 04:55.700]  in some spaces with Black Sale Canon LEDs from Black Sale Market.
[04:55.700 --> 05:01.140]  And I really do enjoy and appreciate the results I am seeing with my LED lights.
[05:01.140 --> 05:03.460]  The plants are growing quite quickly.
[05:03.460 --> 05:05.160]  The stalks are a little bit thicker.
[05:05.160 --> 05:07.380]  The internode spacing is a little bit tighter.
[05:07.380 --> 05:10.020]  The plants seem overall just a little bit healthier.
[05:10.020 --> 05:13.420]  So do I notice it takes less time to finish?
[05:13.420 --> 05:19.300]  Yes, I do notice that it could probably come down about three to five days sooner than
[05:19.420 --> 05:21.380]  what I'm used to with the HPS lights.
[05:21.380 --> 05:24.660]  They're finishing up a little bit more quickly.
[05:24.660 --> 05:26.740]  Just three to five days, maybe a week at the most.
[05:26.740 --> 05:29.180]  I don't have enough experience yet.
[05:29.180 --> 05:33.100]  I don't have enough completed crops to have a good, solid, reliable report.
[05:33.100 --> 05:37.300]  But yes, it did seem like they finished a little bit earlier this time.
[05:37.300 --> 05:43.180]  Then it goes on to say, how far above the canopy do you hang your LED lights?
[05:43.180 --> 05:45.700]  Unfortunately, I ran out of space.
[05:45.700 --> 05:51.380]  So I started off at the recommended ... Black Sale sends a recommendation sheet with the
[05:51.380 --> 05:52.380]  lights.
[05:52.380 --> 05:53.380]  There's a little instruction sheet.
[05:53.380 --> 05:58.180]  I think they say to start off about 36 inches above the canopy, to the best of my memory.
[05:58.180 --> 06:00.140]  I started off as recommended.
[06:00.140 --> 06:04.300]  I saw that the plants were happy, but I thought maybe they could take a little bit more light.
[06:04.300 --> 06:05.740]  So I lowered them.
[06:05.740 --> 06:07.660]  Then the plants were growing like crazy.
[06:07.660 --> 06:08.860]  I put them into flower.
[06:08.860 --> 06:11.700]  And that thing that happens, the plants got taller than anticipated.
[06:11.700 --> 06:14.180]  I didn't flower early enough and they got real tall.
[06:14.180 --> 06:17.380]  I was worried that those plants were going to get burned by that bright light, but they
[06:17.380 --> 06:18.500]  did not.
[06:18.500 --> 06:22.660]  They got about 10 to 14 inches, somewhere in that range, depending on which plant it
[06:22.660 --> 06:24.220]  was, which phenotype it was.
[06:24.220 --> 06:28.940]  They got about 10 to 14 inches from those LEDs and they did not cause any problems.
[06:28.940 --> 06:32.220]  There was no crinkling, no burning, no leaf issues.
[06:32.220 --> 06:33.220]  Everything looked okay.
[06:33.220 --> 06:37.340]  So 10 to 14 inches didn't seem to cause a problem.
[06:37.340 --> 06:39.100]  They needed a lot of water at that rate.
[06:39.100 --> 06:41.300]  They were definitely drinking and eating a lot.
[06:41.300 --> 06:43.880]  So 10 to 14 inches is as close as I would go.
[06:43.880 --> 06:46.080]  And the only reason I did that is because I ran out of space.
[06:46.080 --> 06:49.680]  I was growing that strawberry starburst in there, the strawberry fields in there, and
[06:49.680 --> 06:53.040]  it got up near the lights because it was just growing too long, got tall on me.
[06:53.040 --> 06:57.680]  I would prefer to stay probably about 18 inches away from that light, but I didn't see any
[06:57.680 --> 07:01.600]  problems when I got 10 to 14 other than I needed more water.
[07:01.600 --> 07:03.080]  So it says dimmed or no.
[07:03.080 --> 07:04.200]  I don't dim.
[07:04.200 --> 07:05.320]  I don't dim the lights.
[07:05.320 --> 07:06.520]  I feel like I paid for that light.
[07:06.520 --> 07:08.500]  I want all the wattage from it.
[07:08.500 --> 07:12.080]  Maybe I could have dimmed it when they were getting close, but that's just not my style.
[07:12.080 --> 07:13.080]  I paid for all that.
[07:13.080 --> 07:17.040]  So yes, they did finish faster.
[07:17.040 --> 07:20.160]  They did start to grow into the light and no, I did not dim it.
[07:20.160 --> 07:21.880]  Those are the notes that I wrote down for you.
[07:21.880 --> 07:22.880]  So there is more.
[07:22.880 --> 07:26.560]  It says, should I feed to week six and flush on the plants in these pictures?
[07:26.560 --> 07:28.940]  Here's where we get into another question.
[07:28.940 --> 07:33.040]  These plants were supposed to be in cocoa, but I used a hot organic mix and then transplanted
[07:33.040 --> 07:34.840]  into cocoa.
[07:34.840 --> 07:36.720]  That's kind of where your plants are getting a little bit confused.
[07:36.720 --> 07:38.560]  They got one rhizosphere right in the middle.
[07:38.560 --> 07:43.240]  It's cocoa that's soil and it's holding a bunch of nutrients and it's a hot mix.
[07:43.240 --> 07:45.120]  And then on the outside you got cocoa.
[07:45.120 --> 07:46.480]  So they're not sure what to do.
[07:46.480 --> 07:47.480]  They're kind of confused.
[07:47.480 --> 07:49.860]  It said, I feed them half strength nutrients.
[07:49.860 --> 07:53.000]  They tend to burn if I go heavier than that at the moment.
[07:53.000 --> 07:56.320]  Cause you've got two different root zones and they're kind of confused.
[07:56.320 --> 07:59.600]  It said most likely the VPD is too high.
[07:59.600 --> 08:02.440]  If you think the VPD is too high, you're probably correct.
[08:02.440 --> 08:04.200]  A lot of people say it could be this.
[08:04.200 --> 08:06.360]  It's probably exactly what it is.
[08:06.600 --> 08:10.680]  It's open vented with 86 degrees and 63% humidity.
[08:10.680 --> 08:12.840]  That's a little bit warm and that's a lot of humidity in there.
[08:12.840 --> 08:17.320]  So yeah, it says, but I plan to close things up and use the AC and add CO2 a couple of
[08:17.320 --> 08:18.320]  weeks into flower.
[08:18.320 --> 08:19.320]  That will definitely help you out.
[08:19.320 --> 08:23.600]  But yes, your VPD is off and I don't have a picture of those plants to help you out
[08:23.600 --> 08:25.920]  to tell you what to do with them.
[08:25.920 --> 08:28.560]  But it does sound like yes, your VPD is off.
[08:28.560 --> 08:33.400]  You're asking if you should feed till week six and then flush the plants.
[08:33.440 --> 08:38.760]  I don't have a picture to tell you, but if you think the VPD is off, give them a flush,
[08:38.760 --> 08:41.080]  then get them on a solid regular feeding.
[08:41.080 --> 08:43.400]  Just wash out that cocoa soil mix.
[08:43.400 --> 08:46.080]  It's only going to take one rinse to get anything out of there.
[08:46.080 --> 08:47.440]  Then mix up a solid feeding.
[08:47.440 --> 08:52.240]  You need a good, a good NPK, a good CalMac, put some enzymes in there, put some microbes
[08:52.240 --> 08:54.720]  in there, maybe a kelp product in there.
[08:54.720 --> 08:56.960]  Get a good solid diet for those plants.
[08:56.960 --> 08:58.560]  Give them a good solid meal.
[08:58.560 --> 09:01.640]  Like they just got out of jail or the hospital and you want to feed them up real nice and
[09:01.640 --> 09:03.040]  get them healthy again.
[09:03.040 --> 09:07.360]  Give them a rinse, get all the crap out of them, mix up a solid feed and then feed them.
[09:07.360 --> 09:09.880]  And then let's pay attention to what happens to them from there.
[09:09.880 --> 09:11.520]  And also let's correct the VPD.
[09:11.520 --> 09:16.360]  That VPD is probably making it not able to, making the plants not able to eat properly.
[09:16.360 --> 09:19.600]  So they can't get the proper nutrition if you're even giving it to them.
[09:19.600 --> 09:22.000]  And they're confused by that double root zone stuff.
[09:22.000 --> 09:25.440]  They don't know what to do with the soilless mix, the hot soilless mix in the middle and
[09:25.440 --> 09:27.160]  the cocoa on the outside.
[09:27.160 --> 09:28.400]  They're confused, bro.
[09:28.400 --> 09:31.520]  So that's going to be a struggle for the next couple of weeks.
[09:31.520 --> 09:35.280]  If you're in week six, I would say flush them, water them with a good feed, see how
[09:35.280 --> 09:37.760]  they react and then consider your moves from there.
[09:37.760 --> 09:42.000]  If they respond well to that flushing and new feeding, proceed with caution until about
[09:42.000 --> 09:44.300]  week eight, then flush and then finish them.
[09:44.300 --> 09:47.960]  If they keep acting weird, you're going to have to adjust your feedings.
[09:47.960 --> 09:51.080]  You said that they go, they burn if you go any more than half strength.
[09:51.080 --> 09:52.560]  So feed them half strength, man.
[09:52.560 --> 09:54.200]  Keep going half strength all the way up to the end.
[09:54.200 --> 09:55.200]  Don't burn them.
[09:55.200 --> 09:56.200]  Don't fuck them up.
[09:56.200 --> 09:57.200]  Give them what they need.
[09:57.200 --> 09:59.120]  Try to nurse them all the way to the end and learn from it.
[09:59.120 --> 10:01.100]  Baby them, learn as much as you can.
[10:01.100 --> 10:04.020]  Take a lot of notes, observe a lot, see what they do for you.
[10:04.020 --> 10:09.380]  Then it says, last question, at harvest, do the pistils shrivel when the bud is ripe or
[10:09.380 --> 10:11.380]  should I just watch the trichomes?
[10:11.380 --> 10:15.460]  I'm going to look right into the camera here.
[10:15.460 --> 10:18.100]  Always judge ripeness by your trichomes.
[10:18.100 --> 10:19.100]  Always.
[10:19.100 --> 10:21.160]  That's what tells you when the plants are ripe.
[10:21.160 --> 10:25.100]  Those pistils, the stigmas, those are the breeding parts of the plant.
[10:25.100 --> 10:29.300]  Those are there to catch pollen and slide that pollen down into the calyx, into the
[10:29.300 --> 10:32.380]  ovule, start making a seed.
[10:32.380 --> 10:35.060]  Those pistils, those stigmas aren't for ripeness.
[10:35.060 --> 10:38.060]  We're going to smoke them because they're there, but they don't have anything to do
[10:38.060 --> 10:40.340]  with the buzz, with the ripeness.
[10:40.340 --> 10:41.340]  We don't need those.
[10:41.340 --> 10:44.700]  You could wipe all of those off and the cannabis will still be the same.
[10:44.700 --> 10:46.420]  It will still be high quality.
[10:46.420 --> 10:50.660]  If all the hairs from your buds end up in the bottom of the bag before you smoke it
[10:50.660 --> 10:53.460]  and all you smoke are trichomes, you'll still get high.
[10:53.460 --> 10:56.860]  If all the trichomes come off your buds and all you smoke are hairs, you're not going
[10:56.860 --> 10:57.860]  to get high.
[10:57.940 --> 11:02.740]  So let's not judge ripeness ever by the pistils or the stigmas of our plants.
[11:02.740 --> 11:07.180]  The only way to determine ripeness of a cannabis plant is through the trichomes.
[11:07.180 --> 11:08.700]  You want amber trichomes.
[11:08.700 --> 11:11.100]  A lot of people say 20 to 30% amber.
[11:11.100 --> 11:12.540]  I can agree with that.
[11:12.540 --> 11:14.460]  Cut them down, dry them and cure them.
[11:14.460 --> 11:16.300]  They'll be perfect at that point.
[11:16.300 --> 11:17.300]  Judge your ripeness.
[11:17.300 --> 11:18.300]  Always.
[11:18.300 --> 11:19.540]  I'm looking into the camera right here again.
[11:19.540 --> 11:21.900]  We're going to zoom in on my face for this one.
[11:21.900 --> 11:26.560]  Always determine the ripeness of your cannabis plants by the color of the trichomes.
[11:26.560 --> 11:27.560]  Nothing else matters.
[11:27.560 --> 11:28.560]  All right?
[11:28.560 --> 11:29.560]  You're not going to smoke the leaves.
[11:29.560 --> 11:30.560]  You are.
[11:30.560 --> 11:31.560]  That's not what we're aiming for.
[11:31.560 --> 11:34.600]  If you're going to make a concentrate, all you're going to consume is the trichomes.
[11:34.600 --> 11:35.960]  We're not going to smoke the leaves.
[11:35.960 --> 11:37.860]  We're not trying to smoke the hairs or the stigmas.
[11:37.860 --> 11:40.640]  Our goal is to smoke ripe trichomes.
[11:40.640 --> 11:43.880]  So judge all of your ripeness by your trichomes.
[11:43.880 --> 11:46.080]  That is when you cut down is when the trichomes are ripe.
[11:46.080 --> 11:47.080]  All right.
[11:47.080 --> 11:49.040]  I think I covered all of the questions in this.
[11:49.040 --> 11:53.760]  It says, thanks for the advice and reply in advance from your friend Krios.
[11:54.200 --> 11:58.040]  Hey, Chris, thanks for all of the continued Patreon support and thank you for the great
[11:58.040 --> 11:59.040]  message.
[11:59.040 --> 12:01.360]  And I do apologize that this one took me a minute to get to.
[12:01.360 --> 12:04.080]  I just saw the date on there and I'm late, bro.
[12:04.080 --> 12:05.760]  A big shout out and thank you for the support.
[12:05.760 --> 12:06.760]  All right.
[12:06.760 --> 12:07.760]  Let's keep moving.
[12:07.760 --> 12:11.360]  This message comes from a good friend known as Yee Mufuckin Ha.
[12:11.360 --> 12:16.880]  He spells it Y-E-E-M-U-F-U-K-K-I-N-H-A-W just in case you wondered.
[12:16.880 --> 12:19.360]  That looks like Yee Mufuckin Ha to me.
[12:19.360 --> 12:23.160]  It starts off with, Irie Army for life.
[12:23.160 --> 12:24.160]  That's right, dude.
[12:24.160 --> 12:25.160]  Irie Army for life.
[12:25.160 --> 12:26.720]  It goes on to say, how's it going Rasta Jeff?
[12:26.720 --> 12:28.480]  It's your friend Yee Mufuckin Ha.
[12:28.480 --> 12:30.960]  I hope you and your loved ones are well.
[12:30.960 --> 12:32.360]  I myself am great.
[12:32.360 --> 12:35.040]  I'm pretty sure that my loved ones are doing well also.
[12:35.040 --> 12:38.520]  It says, I would love to hear your thoughts on how you would strategize if you were in
[12:38.520 --> 12:42.960]  a scenario similar to the situation I am in.
[12:42.960 --> 12:45.760]  If you were growing nothing more than your own small personal garden.
[12:45.760 --> 12:52.760]  I've got a 3x5 or a 3.5x3.5 veg space and a 5x5 flower space and a separate spot for
[12:52.760 --> 12:54.800]  seedlings and clones.
[12:54.800 --> 12:59.160]  What would you be looking for in regards to narrowing out about three keepers if your
[12:59.160 --> 13:04.240]  goal is to have a rotation of flavors as well as trying to avoid tolerance buildup to a
[13:04.240 --> 13:05.920]  particular cultivar?
[13:05.920 --> 13:07.640]  That's a very great question.
[13:07.640 --> 13:11.720]  Said my first set of Irie beans arrived in April and after running the females through
[13:11.720 --> 13:15.760]  flower a couple of times and separating the good weed from the incredible weed, I have
[13:15.760 --> 13:21.440]  a firefly and a lemon jeffery that are both far superior to any herb you can find for
[13:21.440 --> 13:23.160]  miles around here.
[13:23.160 --> 13:24.160]  I really loved it.
[13:24.160 --> 13:28.220]  I really love hearing that my genetics are making people happy and that they've got superior
[13:28.220 --> 13:30.480]  product compared to everybody around them.
[13:30.480 --> 13:33.680]  It does go on to say, what does it say?
[13:33.680 --> 13:38.720]  Scarlet begonias is also incredibly bonkers, but she grows so fast I have a hard time staying
[13:38.720 --> 13:40.520]  on top of her.
[13:40.520 --> 13:44.240]  Isn't that a bummer that that plant grows so fast it messes up your schedule?
[13:44.240 --> 13:48.240]  That's how the redheaded stranger that I bred it from was in my commercial grows.
[13:48.240 --> 13:50.480]  I had to cut clones of that two weeks later.
[13:50.520 --> 13:54.520]  I've cut clones of everybody else today and then in two weeks we'll cut that one because
[13:54.520 --> 13:57.960]  she's going to go so quickly that I just don't need her for that two weeks.
[13:57.960 --> 13:58.960]  She'll get way too big.
[13:58.960 --> 14:00.640]  She'll outgrow everybody else and fuck up the rhythm.
[14:00.640 --> 14:02.040]  So I know what you're saying.
[14:02.040 --> 14:04.920]  The mommy plant that made that one had hyper, hyper vigor.
[14:04.920 --> 14:06.720]  I'm trying to get my mic right in my face here.
[14:06.720 --> 14:08.160]  All right, let's keep moving.
[14:08.160 --> 14:13.240]  It says, I know lemon skunk is the mother of both firefly and lemon jeffery, even though
[14:13.240 --> 14:16.000]  these two are not that similar to each other.
[14:16.000 --> 14:17.540]  And I'm thinking long term.
[14:17.540 --> 14:20.240]  If I can part with one of them, I'll have to make a tough decision.
[14:20.280 --> 14:22.440]  Either way, one will stay.
[14:22.440 --> 14:27.720]  So where would you go from there if you were trying to establish a small variety of killers
[14:27.720 --> 14:29.840]  that would be a good rotation?
[14:29.840 --> 14:31.440]  This is a very good question.
[14:31.440 --> 14:35.480]  If you are a medical grower and you're growing for yourself, you need to keep your medicine
[14:35.480 --> 14:36.480]  supplied.
[14:36.480 --> 14:40.080]  But if you continue to smoke the same thing over and over again, you will get what I call
[14:40.080 --> 14:42.200]  strain lock or strain burnout.
[14:42.200 --> 14:47.640]  If I smoked lemon jeffery as one of my top five favorite strains ever of all time, if
[14:47.640 --> 14:52.440]  I smoked lemon jeffery all day, every day by day seven or eight, it's not going to do
[14:52.440 --> 14:53.440]  much.
[14:53.440 --> 14:54.440]  I'm going to smoke it.
[14:54.440 --> 14:55.440]  I'm a heavy smoker, you guys.
[14:55.440 --> 14:56.440]  So it may take most people like a month.
[14:56.440 --> 14:58.560]  It's going to take me a week, 10 days.
[14:58.560 --> 15:01.360]  I'm going to be smoking it and smoking it on days one through three.
[15:01.360 --> 15:02.360]  I'm going to be like, this is good weed.
[15:02.360 --> 15:03.360]  I'm nice and high by day four.
[15:03.360 --> 15:05.280]  I'm going to be like, that ain't working so much.
[15:05.280 --> 15:08.000]  Day five, I'm going to be like, yeah, I need to switch it up by day seven.
[15:08.000 --> 15:11.320]  I'm going to be like, nothing's even happening when I smoke all this.
[15:11.320 --> 15:13.880]  So I do believe you get sort of a strain lock.
[15:13.880 --> 15:16.680]  You get too used to smoking the same thing.
[15:16.720 --> 15:21.320]  Also, if you're growing to, uh, for a profit, you need to switch it up to switch it up for
[15:21.320 --> 15:23.040]  your clientele.
[15:23.040 --> 15:25.760]  People are going to get bored buying the same shit all the same time.
[15:25.760 --> 15:27.720]  So here is a very good question.
[15:27.720 --> 15:31.520]  How do we keep a good rotation of just three different strains?
[15:31.520 --> 15:34.360]  And you did say that you've got the lemon Jeffrey in there.
[15:34.360 --> 15:39.880]  You said you've got the firefly in there and you mentioned Scarlet begonias and you want
[15:39.880 --> 15:42.420]  three keepers.
[15:42.420 --> 15:44.560]  The main thing is what works for you.
[15:44.560 --> 15:48.720]  It sounds like you're in love with the, uh, the firefly and the lemon Jeffrey, which are
[15:48.720 --> 15:52.200]  similar but different, which will be, uh, that's a great thing.
[15:52.200 --> 15:57.180]  If those work for you medicinally, they are very similar, but also very different.
[15:57.180 --> 16:00.760]  So they're going to have similar medicinal properties, but there'll be different enough
[16:00.760 --> 16:04.620]  to where I think you could probably switch them out and not get a strain lock from switching
[16:04.620 --> 16:05.920]  those two different types.
[16:05.920 --> 16:10.440]  Now you said you've got the Scarlet begonias, but it goes too fast for you and it's incredibly
[16:10.440 --> 16:11.440]  bonkers.
[16:11.440 --> 16:12.440]  Yes.
[16:12.440 --> 16:16.560]  Some of the head buzzes, the sativa dominant varieties, they come from that Scarlet begonias
[16:16.560 --> 16:20.800]  cross will give you a panic attack to make you feel all warm when you smoke it, make
[16:20.800 --> 16:24.160]  you feel like your blood's on fire and you've got a sweater on, you just get so hot and
[16:24.160 --> 16:25.160]  panicky.
[16:25.160 --> 16:27.160]  It is bonkers is a great word for it.
[16:27.160 --> 16:33.040]  But it says, where would you go if you had to pick three, four killers for a good rotation?
[16:33.040 --> 16:34.920]  Um, and what works the best for you?
[16:34.920 --> 16:37.200]  It sounds like those two lemon strains are working great for you.
[16:37.200 --> 16:40.080]  It doesn't sound like the Scarlet begonias was your favorite.
[16:40.080 --> 16:44.840]  What I would do is I would pick one for the day and one for the night and then possibly
[16:44.840 --> 16:49.600]  either one to pay the bills, if you know what I mean, and then maybe one for rotation.
[16:49.600 --> 16:54.240]  So you've got your lemon sunrise, you got your lemon Jeffrey, and then we need something
[16:54.240 --> 16:56.960]  else in there just to rotate out of.
[16:56.960 --> 17:01.120]  Those two are kind of the lemon sunrise and lemon Jeffrey are more, I would consider daytime
[17:01.120 --> 17:02.120]  smoke.
[17:02.120 --> 17:04.040]  They're going to keep you up, keep your head going, keep your brain spinning, keep you
[17:04.040 --> 17:05.040]  active.
[17:05.040 --> 17:07.760]  So I would recommend maybe something a little bit more mellow.
[17:08.400 --> 17:12.140]  Maybe something like the double dose or the dark hollow or something, kind of chill you
[17:12.140 --> 17:13.560]  out a little bit.
[17:13.560 --> 17:18.920]  Also those are so far, they don't have as many of the same cannabinoids and turps as
[17:18.920 --> 17:24.440]  the, uh, the lemon strains are more earthy, more cushy, different variety, different flavor,
[17:24.440 --> 17:25.540]  different aroma, different buzz.
[17:25.540 --> 17:29.720]  They do have that arise parent in there, but the mommy plants are so vastly different that
[17:29.720 --> 17:33.320]  the buzz and the medicinal effect are going to be way different.
[17:33.320 --> 17:37.480]  So I would say, um, stick with those two lemons if they're working for you.
[17:38.200 --> 17:40.240]  You don't want to get rid of those if they're working for you.
[17:40.240 --> 17:44.480]  But the funnest part about growing is you have more seeds and you get to hunt that next
[17:44.480 --> 17:47.560]  phenotype every time you get rid of one, as long as you've got one or two that work, you've
[17:47.560 --> 17:49.420]  got room to get that rotation.
[17:49.420 --> 17:54.440]  You've got one to play with, but I would work with the two lemons and then maybe dark hollow
[17:54.440 --> 17:59.180]  and maybe a double dose because those are vastly different from the two you're working
[17:59.180 --> 18:00.180]  with.
[18:00.180 --> 18:04.080]  You can work with the two, have them in rotation, have the other one as that third, like nighttime
[18:04.080 --> 18:05.800]  medicine or a switch it up.
[18:05.800 --> 18:07.680]  So what works the best for you?
[18:07.680 --> 18:09.020]  What's best for you medicinally?
[18:09.020 --> 18:10.020]  That's what we need.
[18:10.020 --> 18:11.740]  I don't know what strains work the best for you.
[18:11.740 --> 18:15.520]  I don't know what your, your brain and your body and all of that stuff require.
[18:15.520 --> 18:17.280]  I don't know if you're trying to stay energized all day.
[18:17.280 --> 18:18.920]  I don't know if you're trying to take a nap.
[18:18.920 --> 18:23.320]  I don't know exactly what you need, but, uh, I would stick with the two you've got and
[18:23.320 --> 18:26.880]  then just, uh, do auditions since you've got two that are reliable.
[18:26.880 --> 18:31.480]  Let's just pop some seeds, man, and see if you can run some, uh, some dark hollow, run
[18:31.480 --> 18:32.820]  a couple of dark hollow seeds.
[18:32.820 --> 18:34.600]  See if one of those does the magic trick for you.
[18:34.600 --> 18:36.640]  If not, you don't have to keep it, abandon it.
[18:36.640 --> 18:39.120]  You've still got those two champions right there for you.
[18:39.120 --> 18:43.060]  So maybe that's my advice as a breeder, as a grower, as somebody who's always looking
[18:43.060 --> 18:47.440]  for the next one, I would say, keep those two reliable there and then just have that
[18:47.440 --> 18:49.120]  third spot as an audition spot.
[18:49.120 --> 18:53.240]  And if something better beats those two, keep the two new best.
[18:53.240 --> 18:55.720]  And that third spot is your new audition spot.
[18:55.720 --> 18:59.640]  Maybe you're going to end up with lemon Jeffrey and dark hollow and something that isn't even
[18:59.640 --> 19:00.780]  released yet.
[19:00.780 --> 19:02.260]  You just haven't found it yet.
[19:02.260 --> 19:06.680]  So just have two reliables and one that's being an audition or always have one that's
[19:06.680 --> 19:08.140]  like that backup rotation.
[19:08.140 --> 19:10.220]  That's always different from the other two.
[19:10.220 --> 19:13.300]  So I would stick with the lemon Jeffrey, the lemon sunrise.
[19:13.300 --> 19:17.340]  And then I keep saying it, but I feel like dark hollow or double dose would fill in that
[19:17.340 --> 19:18.340]  gap very well.
[19:18.340 --> 19:19.340]  It's a different flavor.
[19:19.340 --> 19:21.340]  It's a different aroma and it's a different buzz.
[19:21.340 --> 19:24.180]  And also that double dose puts out big harvest.
[19:24.180 --> 19:26.740]  Uh, the dark hollow puts out a big harvest.
[19:26.740 --> 19:28.180]  You're not going to lose any weight.
[19:28.180 --> 19:31.700]  I know the lemon Jeffrey and the lemon sunrise really put out fat harvest.
[19:32.140 --> 19:35.740]  So if you're expecting a big fat yield like that, you'll still keep all of that.
[19:35.740 --> 19:36.740]  All right.
[19:36.740 --> 19:37.740]  I hope I answered your question there.
[19:37.740 --> 19:40.180]  I'm going to go back over this real quick and make sure I got you.
[19:40.180 --> 19:42.780]  Um, yeah, I think we're good.
[19:42.780 --> 19:43.780]  The struggle is real.
[19:43.780 --> 19:47.100]  It's trying to decide what to grow, not just for you, but for me.
[19:47.100 --> 19:52.220]  I have limited plant counts and as a breeder who wants to do new projects and new things,
[19:52.220 --> 19:54.980]  I completely understand your struggle.
[19:54.980 --> 19:55.980]  And then I'm going to make new stuff.
[19:55.980 --> 20:00.120]  As soon as you decide what you like, I'm going to make new stuff to keep you on your toes
[20:00.200 --> 20:01.640]  and make the decisions hard for you.
[20:01.640 --> 20:02.640]  All right.
[20:02.640 --> 20:03.640]  You motherfucking hi.
[20:03.640 --> 20:04.640]  I want to thank you for the great message.
[20:04.640 --> 20:07.040]  Uh, thank you for all of the continued Patreon support.
[20:07.040 --> 20:08.280]  I do appreciate it.
[20:08.280 --> 20:10.720]  I've got one more email here in front of me.
[20:10.720 --> 20:14.320]  This one comes from our friend Tucker and it goes like this.
[20:14.320 --> 20:15.480]  It says, Hey, Ross to Jeff.
[20:15.480 --> 20:16.480]  How are you, brother?
[20:16.480 --> 20:17.480]  I am marvelous.
[20:17.480 --> 20:19.360]  I'm doing wonderfully tonight.
[20:19.360 --> 20:20.360]  Thank you for asking.
[20:20.360 --> 20:23.520]  It goes on to say, I hope all is Irie.
[20:23.520 --> 20:24.560]  Everything Irie.
[20:24.560 --> 20:27.600]  It says, I am hoping you can answer a few questions on IPM.
[20:27.600 --> 20:31.680]  And I was wondering if you had a recommendation for where to get some predator bugs for my
[20:31.680 --> 20:32.880]  garden.
[20:32.880 --> 20:34.720]  That is a great question.
[20:34.720 --> 20:39.160]  Predator bugs are a great way for, uh, to manage an integrated pest management system.
[20:39.160 --> 20:43.280]  It says I mostly deal with the pressure from spider mites and fungus gnats, but the spider
[20:43.280 --> 20:45.320]  mites are what I am mostly concerned with.
[20:45.320 --> 20:50.800]  I would love to treat my veg and have an idea of what would be best to release for flower.
[20:50.800 --> 20:54.760]  I know you said recently on a podcast, you're moving away from sprays and I would like to
[20:54.760 --> 20:59.640]  follow suit as you have shown me a great deal on things concerning IPM.
[20:59.640 --> 21:02.840]  Thanks and praises to Jaa.
[21:02.840 --> 21:03.840]  Big respect.
[21:03.840 --> 21:04.840]  Thank you for the great message.
[21:04.840 --> 21:05.840]  Yes.
[21:05.840 --> 21:06.840]  Jaa Rastafari.
[21:06.840 --> 21:07.840]  Big thanks and praises to Jaa.
[21:07.840 --> 21:11.960]  Let's talk about adding some beneficial, uh, beneficial bugs.
[21:11.960 --> 21:14.240]  Sorry, that was harder to say than it looked.
[21:14.240 --> 21:18.280]  Let's add some beneficial bugs to your integrated pest management system.
[21:18.280 --> 21:19.600]  Those are a lot of words there.
[21:19.600 --> 21:22.760]  Um, they asked for a reputable place to get them.
[21:22.760 --> 21:24.360]  I am not paid by anybody.
[21:24.360 --> 21:26.160]  I'm not sponsored by anybody.
[21:26.160 --> 21:31.560]  In my opinion, the most reliable spot for a home grower to acquire a living bugs is
[21:31.560 --> 21:35.040]  from rbco-organics.com.
[21:35.040 --> 21:36.740]  I've had great experience with them.
[21:36.740 --> 21:39.120]  A lot of my friends have had great experience with them.
[21:39.120 --> 21:46.600]  I like them a lot, but also you have to be responsible and shop locally first if possible.
[21:46.600 --> 21:51.200]  If you can find a local insectiary that has the bugs you need, I would recommend getting
[21:51.200 --> 21:52.800]  them from them.
[21:52.800 --> 21:57.000]  The less time your bugs are in the mail or on the road or in a shipping container, the
[21:57.000 --> 22:00.040]  more likely you are to get living bugs.
[22:00.040 --> 22:01.120]  They are a living product.
[22:01.120 --> 22:04.040]  We're buying bugs that we want to come out aggressive and hungry.
[22:04.040 --> 22:05.800]  We need them to come out of the box ready to go.
[22:05.800 --> 22:08.320]  We don't need them lethargic and dead from a trip.
[22:08.320 --> 22:10.400]  They don't, they don't need jet lag when they get here.
[22:10.400 --> 22:13.960]  So try to get them from as local of a source as you can.
[22:13.960 --> 22:18.920]  Maybe Google, uh, put in your city and state and then insectiary and see if you can find
[22:18.920 --> 22:21.880]  an insectiary that will sell small batches to you.
[22:21.960 --> 22:27.200]  If not, contact your local nurseries and see if they are offering predator bugs or maybe
[22:27.200 --> 22:31.680]  if they're using predator bugs, maybe they will add some for you to their next order.
[22:31.680 --> 22:34.920]  That's often a way that it happens in smaller communities.
[22:34.920 --> 22:36.920]  Again I do recommend shopping locally.
[22:36.920 --> 22:39.800]  Try to find somewhere that is close to you.
[22:39.800 --> 22:42.600]  You don't want them to have to be shipped for too far.
[22:42.600 --> 22:47.040]  The most important thing you do is get the correct insect for the job.
[22:47.040 --> 22:48.800]  If you've got fungus gnats, you want one bug.
[22:48.800 --> 22:50.280]  If you've got thrips, you may want another.
[22:50.600 --> 22:53.600]  If you've got spider mites, you're going to want to get a couple of bugs.
[22:53.600 --> 22:56.540]  But another thing to keep in mind is your environment.
[22:56.540 --> 23:01.440]  How dry, how humid, how hot and how cold is it in your area?
[23:01.440 --> 23:04.440]  Those things are going to affect how long your pests stick around.
[23:04.440 --> 23:07.100]  Yes, you may buy thousands of predator bugs.
[23:07.100 --> 23:11.040]  You may release a whole bunch of swarskies, a whole bunch of californias, a whole bunch
[23:11.040 --> 23:15.880]  of californicus, a whole bunch of green lacewings, and they may be hanging out for a couple of
[23:15.880 --> 23:19.640]  days and they'll realize it's way too fucking cold here and they'll find ways just to get
[23:19.640 --> 23:20.640]  out.
[23:20.640 --> 23:25.640]  If you can document your temperature and humidity and know kind of where you stay, you should
[23:25.640 --> 23:29.440]  know your regular temperature and humidity in your grow environment.
[23:29.440 --> 23:30.440]  Document that.
[23:30.440 --> 23:32.320]  Contact your local insectiary.
[23:32.320 --> 23:36.520]  Let them know the pest you are facing and let them know your environmental conditions
[23:36.520 --> 23:40.040]  and they will make a recommendation on the appropriate pest.
[23:40.040 --> 23:43.760]  And if you tell them how much space you are working with, square footage, and amount of
[23:43.760 --> 23:47.060]  plants and amount of lamps, they'll do a quick equation.
[23:47.060 --> 23:49.000]  Most of them will know off the top of their head.
[23:49.360 --> 23:51.120]  I'm facing this much pest pressure.
[23:51.120 --> 23:53.120]  It's either moderate or heavy pest pressure.
[23:53.120 --> 23:54.880]  I've got these bugs.
[23:54.880 --> 23:57.160]  Maybe don't mention cannabis.
[23:57.160 --> 23:58.560]  Maybe don't mention cannabis.
[23:58.560 --> 23:59.880]  I don't know who you're talking to.
[23:59.880 --> 24:01.740]  I don't know what state you're in.
[24:01.740 --> 24:03.720]  Maybe don't tell them you're growing cannabis plants.
[24:03.720 --> 24:05.860]  They probably won't ask what kind of plants you're growing.
[24:05.860 --> 24:09.960]  If they do, you can say you're growing hops or you can say you're growing tomatoes.
[24:09.960 --> 24:13.420]  Those are very similar, but let them know what pests you are facing.
[24:13.420 --> 24:14.760]  Let them know your environment.
[24:14.760 --> 24:15.800]  Are you in indoors?
[24:15.800 --> 24:16.800]  Are you in a greenhouse?
[24:16.800 --> 24:17.800]  Are you outdoors?
[24:17.800 --> 24:20.080]  If you have high humidity, what are your temperatures?
[24:20.080 --> 24:21.140]  What are your bugs?
[24:21.140 --> 24:23.120]  Let them make recommendations for you.
[24:23.120 --> 24:29.680]  I said before I recommend the Californicus, the Swarskies, Hypoaspis miles, Persimilis,
[24:29.680 --> 24:30.680]  Green Lacewings.
[24:30.680 --> 24:32.880]  There are quite a few that I could go on with.
[24:32.880 --> 24:35.120]  I don't have any notes about bugs I'm recommending.
[24:35.120 --> 24:36.680]  Those are all off the top of my head.
[24:36.680 --> 24:39.000]  So I hope you got some good advice there.
[24:39.000 --> 24:42.960]  Again, the insectiaries are going to have the best advice for your region.
[24:42.960 --> 24:47.240]  They're going to know what pests to expect and they're going to know what bugs best eradicate
[24:47.240 --> 24:52.000]  those pests in your area and what bugs survive in your environment the best.
[24:52.000 --> 24:53.000]  All right.
[24:53.000 --> 24:55.460]  Tucker, I hope I answered your question thoroughly.
[24:55.460 --> 24:58.120]  If you've got any follow-up questions, I would love to hear from you.
[24:58.120 --> 25:02.960]  You know my email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
