[01:15.450 --> 01:19.450]  You know, I like to start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[01:19.450 --> 01:24.450]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Honey Banana full spectrum extract from Green Dot Labs.
[01:24.450 --> 01:28.450]  This is a blend of banana OG and honey boo boo.
[01:28.450 --> 01:32.450]  On the package, the flavor is described as frosted banana pastry.
[01:32.450 --> 01:35.450]  I think I agree with that, but when I first cracked the jar open,
[01:35.450 --> 01:39.450]  the first aroma to hit my nose made me think of a banana liqueur.
[01:39.450 --> 01:42.450]  I don't know that I've ever had a banana liqueur, but that's what it smelled like to me.
[01:42.450 --> 01:44.450]  Almost maybe a banana's foster.
[01:44.450 --> 01:47.450]  It smells like it may have some ice cream or something sweet to it.
[01:47.450 --> 01:51.450]  But then when I dab it, that liqueur flavor, some of the sweetness goes away,
[01:51.450 --> 01:54.450]  and that banana pastry is dominant in the flavor.
[01:54.450 --> 01:56.450]  It is also really heavy.
[01:56.450 --> 02:00.450]  This stuff made me sit down and chill the fuck out for a couple of minutes.
[02:00.450 --> 02:08.450]  On the back of the package, it says it contains 73.07% THC and non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[02:08.450 --> 02:14.450]  I really enjoy the Honey Banana full spectrum extract from Green Dot Labs.
[02:14.450 --> 02:18.450]  All right, in this episode, I'm going to focus on Patreon questions.
[02:18.450 --> 02:20.450]  I've got a lot of wonderful questions from Patreon.
[02:20.450 --> 02:24.450]  Before we get there, let's do some shout outs to the members of the 710 Club.
[02:24.450 --> 02:30.450]  Of course, the 710 Club are the folks who support the show at the $7.10 a month level or higher on Patreon.
[02:30.450 --> 02:34.450]  So with no further ado, let's give a big shout out to my friend Brett G.

[03:52.450 --> 03:57.450]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, this is the part of the show where we jump into the Patreon messages.
[03:57.450 --> 04:00.450]  I've got a lot of wonderful messages from Patreon.
[04:00.450 --> 04:03.450]  The first message today comes from our friend Tonto.
[04:03.450 --> 04:05.450]  What up, Tonto? Good to hear from you again.
[04:05.450 --> 04:07.450]  We have become good friends lately.
[04:07.450 --> 04:09.450]  This message says, Hey, feel free to call me Tonto.
[04:09.450 --> 04:11.450]  What's up, bro? Good to see you.
[04:11.450 --> 04:14.450]  It says, I hope this message finds you and you're in good health.
[04:14.450 --> 04:17.450]  I'm feeling pretty good today. Nice and stoned. Thank you.
[04:17.450 --> 04:20.450]  It's too hot. If you can make it cooler somehow, that would be cool.
[04:20.450 --> 04:22.450]  Other than that, I got nothing to complain about.
[04:22.450 --> 04:28.450]  It says, I was hoping to get your input on how I should go about cleaning my flower area after pollinating.
[04:28.450 --> 04:33.450]  I have a four by four organic soil living bed with eight plants flowering there.
[04:33.450 --> 04:36.450]  My veg mom cloning tent is a two by four.
[04:36.450 --> 04:39.450]  I know it's a lot going on, but I work with the space.
[04:39.450 --> 04:42.450]  My wife has, I know it's not a lot going on, but I work with the space.
[04:42.450 --> 04:48.450]  My wife has allowed me, so I don't have much room to work with currently, but I'm making it work.
[04:48.450 --> 04:50.450]  Hey, that's what growing is all about.
[04:50.450 --> 04:53.450]  That's also what being married is all about. You're making it work, bro.
[04:53.450 --> 04:55.450]  You're not frustrating the wife too much.
[04:55.450 --> 04:58.450]  She's not denying you complete access to your grow.
[04:58.450 --> 05:01.450]  You're making it work. That's what being a good grower and being a good spouse is all about.
[05:01.450 --> 05:04.450]  So you're doing exactly what you need to do, bro.
[05:04.450 --> 05:07.450]  Then it goes on to say, if you need a picture, see my Instagram.
[05:07.450 --> 05:11.450]  Oh, shameless plug here. Follow our friend at Tonto's underscore garden on Instagram.
[05:11.450 --> 05:13.450]  Check out his grow, see what he's got going on.
[05:13.450 --> 05:19.450]  It goes on to say, I am just about finished going through my first round seeds and strains.
[05:19.450 --> 05:22.450]  I'm interested in crossing or keeping for the future.
[05:22.450 --> 05:27.450]  Oh, I read that was a weird rhythm, but it says I'm just about finished going through my first round of seeds and strains
[05:27.450 --> 05:30.450]  that I'm interested in crossing or keeping for the future. That's better.
[05:30.450 --> 05:35.450]  Then it goes on to say, I was thinking about reversing them one by one to self pollinate
[05:35.450 --> 05:40.450]  and then also pollinate the other strains I have in with it in my flower tent.
[05:40.450 --> 05:45.450]  So Tonto basically wants to reverse a plant and make some seeds for preservation.
[05:45.450 --> 05:51.450]  My question is, how would you recommend I clean my flowering area after to be sure no pollen is left over
[05:51.450 --> 05:54.450]  from the previous run before starting the next cycle?
[05:54.450 --> 05:58.450]  Does pollen go bad after a certain of time if left in an open environment?
[05:58.450 --> 06:04.450]  This is part of my growing journey that is brand new, but it won't be starting until sometime in the fall.
[06:04.450 --> 06:08.450]  Then he signs it with, thanks for all you do. You are greatly appreciated in the cannabis community
[06:08.450 --> 06:11.450]  and source of joy to many. I have no doubt.
[06:11.450 --> 06:14.450]  Hey, thank you. I appreciate hearing that I am a source of joy.
[06:14.450 --> 06:19.450]  A lot of people tell me that I'm appreciated in the community, but to be a source of joy is a new thing.
[06:19.450 --> 06:22.450]  Thank you. That is cool to hear. Let me make sure there's no more to read
[06:22.450 --> 06:24.450]  and then we will take care from Tonto.
[06:24.450 --> 06:27.450]  All right, Tonto, let's talk about pollen.
[06:27.450 --> 06:29.450]  It sounds like you are going to use multiple males.
[06:29.450 --> 06:33.450]  You want to reverse a plant, make some pollen, put that pollen on some females,
[06:33.450 --> 06:35.450]  harvest those seeds, then you'll have to do it again.
[06:35.450 --> 06:39.450]  I wouldn't recommend having multiple males in one run.
[06:39.450 --> 06:41.450]  I would do multiple. I would do different runs.
[06:41.450 --> 06:46.450]  Those would be male A, do a crop with him, finish it, clean up, harvest, then do it again.
[06:46.450 --> 06:48.450]  It sounds like that may be your strategy.
[06:48.450 --> 06:52.450]  You want to know how to get rid of the pollen, how to ensure that the pollen will not stick around
[06:52.450 --> 06:57.450]  for future runs and cross-pollinate, cross-contaminate the other grows.
[06:57.450 --> 07:02.450]  Basically, water will destroy pollen. Water deactivates pollen.
[07:02.450 --> 07:06.450]  Once you have harvested, take down the plants, empty out the room,
[07:06.450 --> 07:08.450]  just spray everything down with water.
[07:08.450 --> 07:13.450]  You can put another cleaning product in there if you choose to just clean the room anyway,
[07:13.450 --> 07:16.450]  some sort of a sanitation product, a sterilization product,
[07:16.450 --> 07:19.450]  maybe you can put hydrogen peroxide in there.
[07:19.450 --> 07:23.450]  There's a product I'm really trying to think of and it will not come to the top of my head right now.
[07:23.450 --> 07:26.450]  You can put that Fizan 20. There we go. That's the one I was trying to think of.
[07:26.450 --> 07:30.450]  You can put some Fizan 20 in there, sterilize the room, clean up the room,
[07:30.450 --> 07:33.450]  but basically water will deactivate the pollen.
[07:33.450 --> 07:36.450]  Once you've harvested the seeds, you've got the room clean, there are no plants in there,
[07:36.450 --> 07:38.450]  just go crazy with the water.
[07:38.450 --> 07:43.450]  I like to spray everything, even the equipment that probably shouldn't get that wet.
[07:43.450 --> 07:46.450]  I still mist it down. I unplug everything, it's turned off.
[07:46.450 --> 07:49.450]  I put my mister as fine as it will go, so I'm putting just super mist everywhere.
[07:49.450 --> 07:53.450]  I'll mist it and then I'll do that just every couple of days when the plants are new.
[07:53.450 --> 07:56.450]  If I put new plants in there, I'll just go spray them with the foliar feed
[07:56.450 --> 07:59.450]  and while I'm hitting them with the foliar, I'll also just get the rest of the room.
[07:59.450 --> 08:01.450]  If you have a humidity real high, get water in there.
[08:01.450 --> 08:03.450]  Again, that water deactivates pollen.
[08:03.450 --> 08:07.450]  If you just want to destroy the pollen, get it wet. That is the main key.
[08:07.450 --> 08:12.450]  You're probably going to clean the room enough between crops just in your basic cleaning.
[08:12.450 --> 08:15.450]  If you're getting in there and scrubbing things down, wiping everything down,
[08:15.450 --> 08:18.450]  you're probably going to get rid of the pollen just in that general cleaning.
[08:18.450 --> 08:20.450]  Some things to think about.
[08:20.450 --> 08:22.450]  We often miss cleaning the tops of the lights.
[08:22.450 --> 08:24.450]  If you've got square-shaped lights, if you don't have...
[08:24.450 --> 08:27.450]  Some lights are round and they aren't shaped the right way to gather stuff at the top,
[08:27.450 --> 08:28.450]  but some lights are long.
[08:28.450 --> 08:31.450]  If you've got a Magnum XXL 8-inch fucking reflector,
[08:31.450 --> 08:35.450]  you've got a big bench up there, a big seating area for pollen just to land up there.
[08:35.450 --> 08:37.450]  Make sure you wipe all that stuff off.
[08:37.450 --> 08:40.450]  Don't forget to look above your head. Wipe all that stuff off.
[08:40.450 --> 08:44.450]  Any surface that may get dusty, that dust is probably containing pollen.
[08:44.450 --> 08:45.450]  Clean that all up.
[08:45.450 --> 08:48.450]  Water is going to be what gets rid of the pollen.
[08:48.450 --> 08:50.450]  Water will help you make sure...
[08:50.450 --> 08:53.450]  If you've got other plants in the area and you're pollinating plants over here
[08:53.450 --> 08:55.450]  and there are plants over here you don't want to get pollinated,
[08:55.450 --> 08:57.450]  you know you're going to be jostling pollen around.
[08:57.450 --> 08:59.450]  Spray the plants on the other side with water
[08:59.450 --> 09:02.450]  and their pistils are basically deactivated when the water comes.
[09:02.450 --> 09:05.450]  When the pollen comes, the pollen will hit the water.
[09:05.450 --> 09:07.450]  The plants won't get pregnant on this side.
[09:07.450 --> 09:08.450]  You can pollinate the plants on this side.
[09:08.450 --> 09:10.450]  Don't rely on that as your only fail-safe,
[09:10.450 --> 09:12.450]  but that is another level.
[09:12.450 --> 09:13.450]  I guess that's a little...
[09:13.450 --> 09:15.450]  What is it? Birth control for your plants there.
[09:15.450 --> 09:18.450]  Water is the main way to deactivate pollen.
[09:18.450 --> 09:19.450]  Water, water, water.
[09:19.450 --> 09:21.450]  Spray it. Spray it a lot. Spray it excessively.
[09:21.450 --> 09:24.450]  Then you can just keep spraying water when you're full of your feeding things.
[09:24.450 --> 09:25.450]  Just spray the room also.
[09:25.450 --> 09:28.450]  If you're pesticide feeding or spraying, spray the room also.
[09:28.450 --> 09:30.450]  Just put more water on the walls, on the gear,
[09:30.450 --> 09:32.450]  then wipe everything down, get rid of it.
[09:32.450 --> 09:36.450]  Pollen usually, if it's left in that room with all the temperature swings,
[09:36.450 --> 09:40.450]  humidity spikes, all the activity, all the light, all the darkness,
[09:40.450 --> 09:44.450]  that pollen will probably deactivate itself in 60 to 90 days.
[09:44.450 --> 09:46.450]  It could survive longer if the conditions are right,
[09:46.450 --> 09:49.450]  but you're getting light and cold or light and dark.
[09:49.450 --> 09:50.450]  You're getting hot and cold.
[09:50.450 --> 09:52.450]  All the temperatures are changing.
[09:52.450 --> 09:53.450]  The environment is changing.
[09:53.450 --> 09:57.450]  That pollen that's free and loose is going to degrade and deactivate quite quickly.
[09:57.450 --> 09:59.450]  So, Tonto, I hope I answered your question.
[09:59.450 --> 10:01.450]  I rambled on quite a bit about that one.
[10:01.450 --> 10:04.450]  Water is the key to deactivating pollen.
[10:04.450 --> 10:05.450]  All right, we've got another message.
[10:05.450 --> 10:08.450]  This one came from our friend.
[10:08.450 --> 10:11.450]  They call themselves Max, Scrim, and Ruby.
[10:11.450 --> 10:14.450]  There might be a joke in there I don't get, but what up, Max, Scrim, and Ruby?
[10:14.450 --> 10:15.450]  Welcome to the show.
[10:15.450 --> 10:17.450]  Thank you for the Patreon support.
[10:17.450 --> 10:20.450]  The question goes, hey man, new Patreon member here.
[10:20.450 --> 10:21.450]  Hey, thank you for joining.
[10:21.450 --> 10:22.450]  I'm sorry I'm too late.
[10:22.450 --> 10:25.450]  It says, first off, I love the show, and I have talked to you on Instagram.
[10:25.450 --> 10:27.450]  This is Max, Scrim, and Ruby.
[10:27.450 --> 10:30.450]  Anyway, you can refer to us as Max, Scrim, and Ruby.
[10:30.450 --> 10:31.450]  What's up, guys?
[10:31.450 --> 10:32.450]  Big shout out to my new friends.
[10:32.450 --> 10:35.450]  It says, my question for you is the herbs now.
[10:35.450 --> 10:38.450]  I just purchased one, and I want to know what you think about using that
[10:38.450 --> 10:41.450]  as the drying and curing part of the grow.
[10:41.450 --> 10:44.450]  We don't work this hard for months to create good product
[10:44.450 --> 10:46.450]  and then ruin it in the final steps.
[10:46.450 --> 10:48.450]  Thank you for what you do for the community, brother.
[10:48.450 --> 10:53.450]  Much love from your homie, Max, Scrim, and Ruby.
[10:53.450 --> 10:56.450]  All right, so what this listener is asking about is a product called
[10:56.450 --> 10:58.450]  the Herbs Now.
[10:58.450 --> 11:00.450]  It is a drying and curing rack that is for sale.
[11:00.450 --> 11:02.450]  I've seen it on social media.
[11:02.450 --> 11:04.450]  I've seen it advertised in a couple of grow magazines
[11:04.450 --> 11:07.450]  and grow geared outlets.
[11:07.450 --> 11:08.450]  Let's talk about it for a moment.
[11:08.450 --> 11:13.450]  I think it is kind of modeled after a food dehydrator.
[11:13.450 --> 11:15.450]  This thing looks just like a food dehydrator.
[11:15.450 --> 11:18.450]  It's got a setting on the front that you set it to the setting you want it.
[11:18.450 --> 11:24.450]  It says that it comes pre-programmed to dry your herb to 15% moisture
[11:24.450 --> 11:27.450]  within 96 hours, and that is four days if you do the math on that.
[11:27.450 --> 11:30.450]  96 divided by 24, that's four days.
[11:30.450 --> 11:32.450]  They say that your herb will be dry.
[11:32.450 --> 11:35.450]  So I don't like it dry that fast.
[11:35.450 --> 11:37.450]  I want it to take longer.
[11:37.450 --> 11:41.450]  They say that it is the perfect temperature and the perfect humidity
[11:41.450 --> 11:44.450]  inside of that container to dry it perfectly.
[11:44.450 --> 11:46.450]  I am skeptical.
[11:46.450 --> 11:50.450]  I would like to see some herb that came from that and see what it does.
[11:50.450 --> 11:54.450]  I prefer a nice, slow dry.
[11:54.450 --> 11:59.450]  Here in Colorado, if I hang my plants, they can be dry in about five to seven days,
[11:59.450 --> 12:02.450]  but I do things to make them dry more slowly.
[12:02.450 --> 12:03.450]  I want it to take longer.
[12:03.450 --> 12:05.450]  I think during the drying and curing process,
[12:05.450 --> 12:09.450]  a lot of chemical reactions that are very important for quality buds
[12:09.450 --> 12:10.450]  happen in that process.
[12:10.450 --> 12:12.450]  We're not going to get too far into that,
[12:12.450 --> 12:17.450]  but I think that a longer, slower dry and cure makes for a better finished product.
[12:17.450 --> 12:20.450]  This thing seems like a fast track to speeding things up,
[12:20.450 --> 12:23.450]  and that doesn't seem like the way to go for drying and curing.
[12:23.450 --> 12:26.450]  Although, the science behind the device,
[12:26.450 --> 12:31.450]  just the way that they designed it, the science, the theory,
[12:31.450 --> 12:35.450]  in theory, it looks like it would really work, but I am skeptical.
[12:35.450 --> 12:38.450]  I've never seen one in person, but I feel skeptical.
[12:38.450 --> 12:39.450]  It could be amazing.
[12:39.450 --> 12:41.450]  I don't want to come on my show where a lot of people listen and say,
[12:41.450 --> 12:44.450]  yeah, that thing doesn't look like it would do what you're thinking it's going to do,
[12:44.450 --> 12:46.450]  but it could, it could not.
[12:46.450 --> 12:51.450]  I am scared of it because I want my buds to dry more slowly.
[12:51.450 --> 12:56.450]  The one thing I did think about is if you're in Florida or somewhere where it's real sticky
[12:56.450 --> 12:58.450]  and you've got a lot of humidity, a lot of moisture,
[12:58.450 --> 13:03.450]  and it takes too long for your buds to dry, this may be a good device for you.
[13:03.450 --> 13:04.450]  But here, I'm in Colorado.
[13:04.450 --> 13:07.450]  I'm trying to slow down the drying of my product.
[13:07.450 --> 13:11.450]  I want five or seven, maybe 10, maybe even 12 days of drying time.
[13:11.450 --> 13:14.450]  This thing says 96 hours.
[13:14.450 --> 13:15.450]  I don't know about that.
[13:15.450 --> 13:17.450]  Herb that I've had that dried too fast, too quickly,
[13:17.450 --> 13:20.450]  never tasted the way that I wished it would taste.
[13:20.450 --> 13:24.450]  The herb that took a little bit longer always tasted better, in my opinion.
[13:24.450 --> 13:27.450]  So, without having touched the product, without having smoked any of the product
[13:27.450 --> 13:31.450]  that came out of this device, I can't give you like a real definite answer.
[13:31.450 --> 13:32.450]  That would be unfair.
[13:32.450 --> 13:35.450]  It looks like it could go either way.
[13:35.450 --> 13:36.450]  To tell you the honest truth.
[13:36.450 --> 13:39.450]  I don't think it is the product for me, but I don't know where you are.
[13:39.450 --> 13:41.450]  Like I said, if you're in a high humidity environment,
[13:41.450 --> 13:44.450]  if you really need to get that product dried and cured out of there,
[13:44.450 --> 13:46.450]  that may be the way to do it.
[13:46.450 --> 13:49.450]  If you have been not hitting your dry and cure goals,
[13:49.450 --> 13:52.450]  if you're not getting it dialed in properly, this may help.
[13:52.450 --> 13:56.450]  If you're completely ruining your product at the end and you're not happy,
[13:56.450 --> 13:57.450]  this could be the rescuer.
[13:57.450 --> 14:00.450]  If you're already sucking, this may improve it.
[14:00.450 --> 14:03.450]  But I think old school drying and curing is basically free.
[14:03.450 --> 14:06.450]  You don't need to buy too much equipment for a small grow.
[14:06.450 --> 14:09.450]  You may need a humidifier and a dehumidifier if you're buying that much gear.
[14:09.450 --> 14:11.450]  That may be when it comes to looking into one of these.
[14:11.450 --> 14:16.450]  But without seeing it, without touching it, I can't give you a real honest evaluation.
[14:16.450 --> 14:19.450]  I wish I did have more info for you.
[14:19.450 --> 14:21.450]  Buy one. You said you bought one.
[14:21.450 --> 14:23.450]  So, run it. See what it does, bro.
[14:23.450 --> 14:25.450]  Dry some of your herb the way you used to,
[14:25.450 --> 14:27.450]  and then dry some of your herb in this machine and compare.
[14:27.450 --> 14:28.450]  See what you like better.
[14:28.450 --> 14:32.450]  And then give me some feedback and we can talk about it on the show.
[14:32.450 --> 14:37.450]  Alright, I want to keep moving because I do have a nice stack of Patreon messages here.
[14:37.450 --> 14:40.450]  This one says, CBD trichome question.
[14:40.450 --> 14:44.450]  I think I took a screenshot of this one because when I tried to print the message, it did not print.
[14:44.450 --> 14:45.450]  So, we're going to scroll through.
[14:45.450 --> 14:47.450]  Here we go. I found the message.
[14:47.450 --> 14:49.450]  This one comes from our friend Papa Z.
[14:49.450 --> 14:50.450]  And it says, What up, Ross DeJeff.
[14:50.450 --> 14:54.450]  First of all, your show has helped me and others, I'm sure, beyond words.
[14:54.450 --> 14:56.450]  That is awesome to hear. Thank you.
[14:56.450 --> 14:59.450]  It says, It is an honor to have a black belt grower such as yourself,
[14:59.450 --> 15:01.450]  and I consider you my mentor.
[15:01.450 --> 15:03.450]  And for that, I am eternally grateful.
[15:03.450 --> 15:06.450]  I am all of your mentor and I appreciate that.
[15:06.450 --> 15:07.450]  You're very welcome.
[15:07.450 --> 15:09.450]  Thank you for the support and the kind words.
[15:09.450 --> 15:12.450]  It says, I get back way more than I give through Patreon.
[15:12.450 --> 15:14.450]  Man, you give and that is appreciated.
[15:14.450 --> 15:16.450]  You don't have to contribute to the show.
[15:16.450 --> 15:17.450]  Nobody is required.
[15:17.450 --> 15:18.450]  I put the show out for free.
[15:18.450 --> 15:21.450]  So, it is greatly appreciated that you contribute to Patreon.
[15:21.450 --> 15:22.450]  Thank you.
[15:22.450 --> 15:26.450]  Then it goes on to say, I'm also a fellow drummer of 35 years.
[15:26.450 --> 15:27.450]  What's up, bro?
[15:27.450 --> 15:28.450]  I hope your wrists feel okay.
[15:28.450 --> 15:29.450]  I've been drumming for a long time.
[15:29.450 --> 15:30.450]  My knees are starting to hurt.
[15:30.450 --> 15:31.450]  My wrists feel weird.
[15:31.450 --> 15:33.450]  I think it's from bashing on shit for way too long.
[15:33.450 --> 15:35.450]  Keep in time, brother.
[15:35.450 --> 15:37.450]  Then the message goes on to say,
[15:37.450 --> 15:39.450]  Cannabis, drums, and family are my loves.
[15:39.450 --> 15:41.450]  That's why we get along, bro.
[15:41.450 --> 15:42.450]  Keeps going.
[15:42.450 --> 15:43.450]  It says, My question is this.
[15:43.450 --> 15:47.450]  I am growing a critical mass one-to-one auto.
[15:47.450 --> 15:53.450]  So, it's got a one-to-one ratio of CBD to THC is what was advertised on the package.
[15:53.450 --> 15:55.450]  It hasn't tested the product because it is still growing,
[15:56.450 --> 16:01.450]  but that is what is to be expected from the phenotype based on advertising.
[16:01.450 --> 16:03.450]  It says, August 5th will be eight weeks into flower.
[16:03.450 --> 16:05.450]  So, I have just started flushing.
[16:05.450 --> 16:07.450]  Alright, so you've got an eight or nine week plant,
[16:07.450 --> 16:08.450]  maybe a nine or ten week plant.
[16:08.450 --> 16:10.450]  You've just begun the flush.
[16:10.450 --> 16:18.450]  It says, Does the 30% amber trichome guideline apply the same to CBD rich plants as straight THC plants?
[16:18.450 --> 16:21.450]  Thanks again and much love from Papa Z.
[16:21.450 --> 16:25.450]  Then it says, What would I have to do to get a Grow From Your Heart sticker?
[16:25.450 --> 16:27.450]  I would have to make them.
[16:27.450 --> 16:30.450]  There are no Grow From Your Heart podcast stickers available yet,
[16:30.450 --> 16:33.450]  but it is almost time for me to place an order with my sticker maker
[16:33.450 --> 16:37.450]  and I may include the GFYH logo in that sticker print.
[16:37.450 --> 16:38.450]  We'll see how that one goes.
[16:38.450 --> 16:40.450]  So, when I make stickers, I'll keep you posted.
[16:40.450 --> 16:42.450]  I owe you a sticker because you support me on Patreon.
[16:42.450 --> 16:43.450]  So, thank you.
[16:43.450 --> 16:45.450]  Now, let's talk about your trichomes.
[16:45.450 --> 16:48.450]  You're growing for CBD.
[16:48.450 --> 16:52.450]  You're trying to get that one to one CBD to THC ratio.
[16:52.450 --> 16:54.450]  I am not a CBD expert.
[16:54.450 --> 16:56.450]  That is not my realm.
[16:56.450 --> 16:57.450]  That is not my desire.
[16:57.450 --> 16:59.450]  I don't grow for CBD.
[16:59.450 --> 17:00.450]  I want the opposite.
[17:00.450 --> 17:02.450]  If you guys know me, I want to get high.
[17:02.450 --> 17:03.450]  I want to go up.
[17:03.450 --> 17:05.450]  I think going up makes me feel better.
[17:05.450 --> 17:08.450]  CBD makes me feel I lose dexterity.
[17:08.450 --> 17:10.450]  If I were playing, I don't play video games.
[17:10.450 --> 17:12.450]  I don't play guitar, but if I were trying to play guitar,
[17:12.450 --> 17:14.450]  I do kind of fiddle on a guitar.
[17:14.450 --> 17:16.450]  It's not my thing, but I've got one and I dick around on it.
[17:16.450 --> 17:20.450]  So, if I smoke a CBD product and try to dick around on the guitar,
[17:20.450 --> 17:24.450]  my fingers aren't as dexterous as they would be
[17:24.450 --> 17:26.450]  had I not consumed the CBD product.
[17:26.450 --> 17:28.450]  They get a little rubbery, a little Gumby-like.
[17:28.450 --> 17:32.450]  I just don't have the full control like I feel like I normally would
[17:32.450 --> 17:33.450]  had I not consumed CBD.
[17:33.450 --> 17:35.450]  So, I'm not a CBD expert.
[17:35.450 --> 17:36.450]  I don't grow CBD.
[17:36.450 --> 17:40.450]  I don't breed CBD, but I would like to assume
[17:40.450 --> 17:44.450]  that you're still going to use that amber trichome,
[17:44.450 --> 17:49.450]  30% amber trichome guideline because we still want ripe trichomes.
[17:49.450 --> 17:51.450]  I think they're ripe when they're that color.
[17:51.450 --> 17:53.450]  I don't know which cannabinoid they are ripe with,
[17:53.450 --> 17:56.450]  but it feels like that is a ripe trichome.
[17:56.450 --> 17:58.450]  We want fruits when they're ripe.
[17:58.450 --> 17:59.450]  We can identify when they're ripe.
[17:59.450 --> 18:03.450]  We still want our cannabis ripe, and I think that that trichome color
[18:03.450 --> 18:06.450]  is still the way to determine that, even though we're going after the CBD.
[18:06.450 --> 18:09.450]  I wish I had better input for you.
[18:09.450 --> 18:11.450]  I'm sitting here thinking of different ways to think of this,
[18:11.450 --> 18:13.450]  but I think that's the best way to do it.
[18:13.450 --> 18:15.450]  Just go by those trichomes just like you normally do.
[18:15.450 --> 18:17.450]  I'm going to take a quick drink, and we're going to keep moving.
[18:19.450 --> 18:24.980]  All right.
[18:24.980 --> 18:25.980]  I even thought about it while I was drinking,
[18:25.980 --> 18:29.980]  and I want you to continue by following that 30% amber trichome rule,
[18:29.980 --> 18:33.980]  and if there are any CBD farmers out there who have better guidance for us,
[18:33.980 --> 18:37.980]  let us know, and then I'll feed you back with that info as it comes into me.
[18:37.980 --> 18:39.980]  Hey, Papa Z, thank you for the great question,
[18:39.980 --> 18:41.980]  and I do look forward to getting replies from my audience
[18:41.980 --> 18:43.980]  to help you out a little bit further.
[18:43.980 --> 18:44.980]  All right.
[18:44.980 --> 18:46.980]  I do have more Patreon questions.
[18:46.980 --> 18:48.980]  We're going to keep this show moving.
[18:48.980 --> 18:50.980]  This one comes from WillysArmpit.
[18:50.980 --> 18:52.980]  I see your name pop up a lot on Patreon.
[18:52.980 --> 18:54.980]  I give you a shout-out a lot at the start of the show.
[18:54.980 --> 18:56.980]  That is a really cool, unique name.
[18:56.980 --> 18:57.980]  I like it.
[18:57.980 --> 19:00.980]  It stands out, so I'm glad to get your message on the show.
[19:00.980 --> 19:03.980]  This, a message goes just like this.
[19:03.980 --> 19:04.980]  It says, Hello, Rasta Jeff.
[19:04.980 --> 19:06.980]  Hey, bro, good to see you.
[19:06.980 --> 19:08.980]  I finally made it back to Patreon.
[19:08.980 --> 19:11.980]  I'm glad you're here, brother, and you guys don't ever sweat or stress
[19:11.980 --> 19:13.980]  that you can't help out on Patreon.
[19:13.980 --> 19:14.980]  That is okay.
[19:14.980 --> 19:16.980]  There are plenty of people that do help out.
[19:16.980 --> 19:17.980]  I appreciate it.
[19:17.980 --> 19:19.980]  I know I pitch Patreon a lot.
[19:19.980 --> 19:21.980]  A lot of people want to help out.
[19:21.980 --> 19:24.980]  Don't feel like you can't listen or that I don't like you as much
[19:24.980 --> 19:25.980]  because you're not on Patreon.
[19:25.980 --> 19:26.980]  We're all friends.
[19:26.980 --> 19:28.980]  I treat everyone as equals.
[19:28.980 --> 19:31.980]  Patreon does help get your emails to the top of the list,
[19:31.980 --> 19:34.980]  but I do read other messages that don't come from Patreon,
[19:34.980 --> 19:37.980]  but I promise these people to get read as soon as I can.
[19:37.980 --> 19:40.980]  The next recording session, from the time I get your Patreon question,
[19:40.980 --> 19:42.980]  I try to put you on the next show.
[19:42.980 --> 19:44.980]  Don't worry if you can't support Patreon.
[19:44.980 --> 19:45.980]  I still want you to listen.
[19:45.980 --> 19:48.980]  There are people out there that are supporting it to keep it going,
[19:48.980 --> 19:49.980]  even if you can't.
[19:49.980 --> 19:54.980]  What you can do is you can grow the best cannabis you know how to grow
[19:54.980 --> 19:55.980]  when you're in your growth.
[19:55.980 --> 19:57.980]  Do your best every day, and that pays me back.
[19:57.980 --> 19:59.980]  Do your growth the best you can.
[19:59.980 --> 20:00.980]  Make me proud.
[20:00.980 --> 20:01.980]  That's what I'm here for.
[20:01.980 --> 20:03.980]  That means more than money to me.
[20:03.980 --> 20:04.980]  You grow your best herb you can.
[20:04.980 --> 20:05.980]  Make me proud.
[20:05.980 --> 20:07.980]  That puts a smile on my face.
[20:07.980 --> 20:08.980]  All right, I'm going to get back into this message
[20:08.980 --> 20:12.980]  because that honey banana got me fucking rambly today.
[20:12.980 --> 20:13.980]  This message says,
[20:13.980 --> 20:18.980]  I just recently started your Veg Bloom and New Millennium Nutrient Program.
[20:18.980 --> 20:21.980]  If you listen back a few episodes, a lot of episodes,
[20:21.980 --> 20:24.980]  I do a full description of my nutrient mix,
[20:24.980 --> 20:28.980]  and I use New Millennium bottled nutrients and Veg Bloom powdered nutrients.
[20:28.980 --> 20:30.980]  In different facilities, I use one as a base.
[20:30.980 --> 20:32.980]  In different facilities, I use the other.
[20:32.980 --> 20:36.980]  In some facilities, I'm mixing them and making a turbo nutrient mix here.
[20:36.980 --> 20:37.980]  It's the secret sauce.
[20:37.980 --> 20:39.980]  This guy goes on to say,
[20:39.980 --> 20:40.980]  Willie's Armpit goes on to say,
[20:40.980 --> 20:44.980]  I'm four weeks into flower, and I have never seen my plants healthier.
[20:44.980 --> 20:45.980]  I love hearing that.
[20:45.980 --> 20:47.980]  I'm sure my friends at Veg Bloom and my friends at New Millennium
[20:47.980 --> 20:49.980]  love hearing that as well.
[20:49.980 --> 20:50.980]  It says,
[20:50.980 --> 20:54.980]  My garden has never looked so happy as it does now.
[20:54.980 --> 20:56.980]  I've been hooked on Bodhi seeds for years now.
[20:56.980 --> 20:57.980]  Bodhi makes a great product.
[20:57.980 --> 21:01.980]  I love Bodhi, but I'm definitely switching to Irie Genetics.
[21:01.980 --> 21:05.980]  There's no need to switch up to Irie if Bodhi's making you happy.
[21:05.980 --> 21:08.980]  If you're loving what's coming out of your garden when you're growing Bodhi seeds,
[21:08.980 --> 21:09.980]  keep growing Bodhi seeds.
[21:09.980 --> 21:12.980]  Bodhi's a great dude, a great breeder, makes a great product.
[21:12.980 --> 21:16.980]  No reason to switch it up unless that is something you're choosing to do on your own,
[21:16.980 --> 21:17.980]  just to switch it up.
[21:17.980 --> 21:19.980]  But I promote Bodhi.
[21:19.980 --> 21:20.980]  Bodhi is a great dude, breeder.
[21:20.980 --> 21:23.980]  Like I said, nothing wrong with growing Bodhi's gear.
[21:23.980 --> 21:24.980]  Keep doing that.
[21:24.980 --> 21:25.980]  Some wonderful strains come out of Bodhi.
[21:25.980 --> 21:27.980]  So, where am I?
[21:27.980 --> 21:28.980]  I'm on this page.
[21:28.980 --> 21:29.980]  It says,
[21:29.980 --> 21:30.980]  Anyway, I can show my love.
[21:30.980 --> 21:33.980]  Anyway, now I can show my love and support.
[21:33.980 --> 21:34.980]  Sign me up.
[21:34.980 --> 21:37.980]  No one has ever done for my garden what you have done.
[21:37.980 --> 21:38.980]  I cannot thank you enough.
[21:38.980 --> 21:43.980]  I wish I could pledge more to Patreon because you are definitely worth it.
[21:43.980 --> 21:49.980]  Hey, WillysArmpit, just hearing how ecstatic and delighted you are with your garden,
[21:49.980 --> 21:51.980]  from my advice, is payment enough.
[21:51.980 --> 21:52.980]  Bro, don't sweat.
[21:52.980 --> 21:55.980]  Don't stress that you can't help me out more on Patreon.
[21:55.980 --> 21:56.980]  You are doing what you can.
[21:56.980 --> 22:01.980]  You just told me that your garden looks better from the time I put in behind this microphone.
[22:01.980 --> 22:03.980]  All I had to do was come here and talk.
[22:03.980 --> 22:04.980]  It takes a little bit of equipment.
[22:04.980 --> 22:05.980]  I got some toys.
[22:05.980 --> 22:06.980]  I got some technology happening.
[22:06.980 --> 22:07.980]  Some prep work.
[22:07.980 --> 22:13.980]  But basically, I sat here and spoke into this microphone, and your garden looks better because you took that info.
[22:13.980 --> 22:15.980]  So, that means enough to me.
[22:15.980 --> 22:16.980]  You don't have to give me money.
[22:16.980 --> 22:17.980]  Thank you.
[22:17.980 --> 22:18.980]  Keep kicking ass in your garden.
[22:18.980 --> 22:23.980]  Keep growing the best product you can grow, and you'll pay me back every single day.
[22:23.980 --> 22:24.980]  Big shout out to WillysArmpit.
[22:24.980 --> 22:29.980]  Man, I'm glad your garden looks good, and if you have any questions about the VegBloom and New Millennium Mix,
[22:29.980 --> 22:30.980]  please reach out.
[22:30.980 --> 22:32.980]  I would love to help you out.
[22:33.980 --> 22:34.980]  All right.
[22:34.980 --> 22:35.980]  Let's see.
[22:35.980 --> 22:36.980]  Let's see.
[22:36.980 --> 22:37.980]  This one did not come from Patreon.
[22:37.980 --> 22:41.980]  See, I told you that I read messages that don't only come from Patreon.
[22:41.980 --> 22:46.980]  I think by the end of this episode and the next one, I'll be caught up on Patreon messages unless we get a bunch more.
[22:46.980 --> 22:47.980]  But let's keep the show moving.
[22:47.980 --> 22:48.980]  This one says,
[22:48.980 --> 22:53.980]  Hey, Rasta Jeff, I wanted to run a question across you to see if you had any ideas.
[22:53.980 --> 22:56.980]  I feel like I am the guy to answer this question.
[22:56.980 --> 23:00.980]  It says, I have a 10-pack of seeds from a breeder back in the day.
[23:00.980 --> 23:01.980]  I'm not going to say the seeds or the breeder.
[23:01.980 --> 23:02.980]  We're going to keep that out of this.
[23:02.980 --> 23:09.980]  It says, I started three in rapid rooters like I always do and a tray with the dome under T5s.
[23:09.980 --> 23:12.980]  The temperature is 76 and the humidity is 62%.
[23:12.980 --> 23:21.980]  After a couple of days, the seeds developed fuzz on them, so I cleaned them off and put them in soil so far after a week on sprouting.
[23:21.980 --> 23:24.980]  And put them in soil so far after a week of sprouting.
[23:24.980 --> 23:26.980]  We're going to say that was supposed to say of sprouting.
[23:27.980 --> 23:33.980]  This person started off some seeds, 10 of them, and they put them in rapid rooters the way that they normally do.
[23:33.980 --> 23:36.980]  They put them in a tray with a dome under T5s.
[23:36.980 --> 23:38.980]  That works for you.
[23:38.980 --> 23:39.980]  I don't do the dome.
[23:39.980 --> 23:40.980]  I don't like a dome for my seeds.
[23:40.980 --> 23:41.980]  I don't find it necessary.
[23:41.980 --> 23:45.980]  We use the dome for clones to keep the humidity in there because they don't have roots to feed from.
[23:45.980 --> 23:48.980]  The seedlings, they don't need as much humidity.
[23:48.980 --> 23:49.980]  I feel like it makes them weak.
[23:49.980 --> 23:52.980]  We've got to take them off the dome and introduce them to the environment.
[23:52.980 --> 23:53.980]  I don't ever give them a dome.
[23:53.980 --> 23:55.980]  They don't start off being babied and pampered.
[23:55.980 --> 23:58.980]  I think it gives them a little bit of a boost, a little bit more strength.
[23:58.980 --> 24:01.980]  The way you're doing it, if it works for you, do that.
[24:01.980 --> 24:03.980]  But I'm just saying I don't do the dome.
[24:03.980 --> 24:05.980]  It says temperature 76.
[24:05.980 --> 24:06.980]  That should be fine.
[24:06.980 --> 24:08.980]  It may go a little bit warmer, but they're going to be okay.
[24:08.980 --> 24:09.980]  Humidity is 62.
[24:09.980 --> 24:10.980]  That's going to work for you.
[24:10.980 --> 24:14.980]  After a couple of days, the seeds developed fuzz on them.
[24:14.980 --> 24:18.980]  That could be a couple of things, but I want to keep reading.
[24:18.980 --> 24:21.980]  I've never had this problem before with this method.
[24:21.980 --> 24:24.980]  I have seen that some people use Dr. Zimes before putting seeds into the rooter.
[24:24.980 --> 24:27.980]  Will this help, or are the seeds just bad?
[24:27.980 --> 24:29.980]  Feel free to use this question on the show.
[24:29.980 --> 24:32.980]  Big thanks for everything you do and dropping free knowledge.
[24:32.980 --> 24:34.980]  Hey, you are very welcome.
[24:34.980 --> 24:35.980]  Let's talk about this.
[24:35.980 --> 24:38.980]  This could be a couple of things.
[24:38.980 --> 24:41.980]  It sounds like you've done this before and you know what you're doing,
[24:41.980 --> 24:44.980]  but possibly, I'm not blaming you, this is an option,
[24:44.980 --> 24:48.980]  possibly that rapid rooter, that moist rapid rooter, that seed, that dome,
[24:48.980 --> 24:53.980]  that heat, that environment, that could have caused a little bit of that cobweb,
[24:53.980 --> 24:55.980]  spiderweb-looking white mildew.
[24:55.980 --> 24:57.980]  That could have caused that.
[24:57.980 --> 24:58.980]  I don't know.
[24:58.980 --> 24:59.980]  I'm not blaming you.
[24:59.980 --> 25:00.980]  I'm just listing options.
[25:00.980 --> 25:01.980]  That could have done it.
[25:01.980 --> 25:04.980]  It could have been the moisture in the rapid rooter being stuck in the dome.
[25:04.980 --> 25:07.980]  That could have set up the perfect environment for that mildew.
[25:07.980 --> 25:11.980]  The other option is maybe, and this is why I didn't say the breeder of the seeds
[25:11.980 --> 25:16.980]  or the name of the strain, it is possible that those seeds came from plants
[25:16.980 --> 25:20.980]  that had powdery mildew in them, and maybe they just had mildew on the plants.
[25:20.980 --> 25:23.980]  Maybe there was some sort of a pathogen in the plants.
[25:23.980 --> 25:27.980]  Also, maybe another option, maybe when those seeds were harvested,
[25:27.980 --> 25:31.980]  maybe they were not allowed to dry properly before they were put into a package.
[25:31.980 --> 25:32.980]  They were still moist.
[25:32.980 --> 25:33.980]  They were sealed up.
[25:33.980 --> 25:35.980]  They were put into a package.
[25:35.980 --> 25:36.980]  A little bit of mildew developed.
[25:36.980 --> 25:39.980]  That way, you seal up moisture and you give it a little bit of heat.
[25:39.980 --> 25:41.980]  That is the perfect environment, dark, moist, and warm.
[25:41.980 --> 25:43.980]  That's going to give you mildew.
[25:43.980 --> 25:47.980]  So those are three ways that that mildew could have happened in your seedlings.
[25:47.980 --> 25:49.980]  You could have gotten it in the rapid rooter.
[25:49.980 --> 25:51.980]  It could have happened in the plants while they were growing,
[25:51.980 --> 25:54.980]  or it could have happened in packaging.
[25:54.980 --> 25:57.980]  When you breed seeds, it's a lot like having a wet herb,
[25:57.980 --> 25:59.980]  and then you have a bunch of wet herbs.
[25:59.980 --> 26:01.980]  You get it dry enough to take the seeds out.
[26:01.980 --> 26:02.980]  You take the seeds out.
[26:02.980 --> 26:05.980]  The seeds still have moisture in them and on them sometimes,
[26:05.980 --> 26:08.980]  and if you're in a big hurry, you're just a commercial producer trying to get them out.
[26:08.980 --> 26:10.980]  Maybe, just maybe, you packaged them up.
[26:10.980 --> 26:11.980]  You didn't give them enough time.
[26:11.980 --> 26:13.980]  They're still a little bit moist.
[26:13.980 --> 26:14.980]  That's a possibility.
[26:14.980 --> 26:18.980]  I don't know exactly what happened, but those are the three things that come to my mind
[26:18.980 --> 26:22.980]  when I try to think about why your little seedlings may have gotten fuzzy.
[26:22.980 --> 26:26.980]  Now you ask, people use Dr. Zimes before putting the seeds into the rooter.
[26:26.980 --> 26:27.980]  Will that help?
[26:27.980 --> 26:31.980]  That may have helped depending on what that pathogen was on there.
[26:31.980 --> 26:34.980]  Maybe. Possibly, probably.
[26:34.980 --> 26:37.980]  I've also seen people put a little bit of hydrogen peroxide in the water
[26:37.980 --> 26:40.980]  to try to take care of that, so that may have been an option for you also.
[26:40.980 --> 26:42.980]  I think we spoke a little bit about this.
[26:42.980 --> 26:44.980]  I think you've already found a solution for your seedlings.
[26:44.980 --> 26:46.980]  All right. I want to thank you for the great message.
[26:46.980 --> 26:49.980]  I hope I solved your problem or at least gave you a little bit of insight.
[26:49.980 --> 26:51.980]  I'm not sure if you want your name said on the show.
[26:51.980 --> 26:53.980]  You did not include it here in the email.
[26:53.980 --> 26:55.980]  You know who you are. Big thank you.
[26:55.980 --> 26:56.980]  I see your name pop up quite a bit.
[26:56.980 --> 26:58.980]  I see you in the Instagram feed all the time.
[26:58.980 --> 26:59.980]  Thank you for hanging out.
[26:59.980 --> 27:01.980]  All right. I want to read another message.
[27:01.980 --> 27:06.980]  This one says, Yo, Rasta Jeff, I love the show and the in-depth answers you give to each question.
[27:06.980 --> 27:08.980]  A lot of people don't like the in-depth answers.
[27:08.980 --> 27:12.980]  I get rambly a little bit, but I'm glad you enjoy the in-depth answers.
[27:13.980 --> 27:16.980]  It says it really shows how much preparation goes into each response.
[27:16.980 --> 27:21.980]  I write down a few notes on each email and then I try to keep it spontaneous and go from the top of my head.
[27:21.980 --> 27:26.980]  I did an episode a couple of shows back where I took way too many notes and it didn't feel natural.
[27:26.980 --> 27:28.980]  I didn't like the show's flow.
[27:28.980 --> 27:31.980]  So I try to just make a couple of bullet points and keep it going.
[27:31.980 --> 27:33.980]  Keep it flowing naturally. Keep it conversational.
[27:33.980 --> 27:37.980]  I'd rather talk with you than to you or at you, I think is what I'm trying to say.
[27:37.980 --> 27:40.980]  But let me continue because I'm doing that thing where I ramble again.
[27:41.980 --> 27:50.980]  Anyways, I'm watching a short video on terpenes right now and it made me think of your comment on a recent episode about limonene coming out when you have your lights closer to the plants.
[27:50.980 --> 27:55.980]  Yes, I have said before that I believe we can bring out the limonene.
[27:55.980 --> 28:02.980]  If you've got a lemon flavored plant and you want it to be even more lemony, get it a little bit too close to the light late in flower.
[28:02.980 --> 28:06.980]  I think limonene is sort of a stress response, kind of a reaction.
[28:06.980 --> 28:10.980]  I don't know exactly what it does, but the plant goes, shit, it's way too hot. It's way too light.
[28:10.980 --> 28:13.980]  I'm going to create this thing and it makes limonene.
[28:13.980 --> 28:16.980]  I don't know what the plant thinks it's going to do, but it does that.
[28:16.980 --> 28:20.980]  And it creates limonene and we harvest those plants and they taste fucking lemony.
[28:20.980 --> 28:25.980]  I had a sour diesel plant that grew way too close to the light and it tastes like lemon sour diesel.
[28:25.980 --> 28:28.980]  That's part of what made me start thinking about this.
[28:28.980 --> 28:33.980]  Then I noticed those plants that got too close to the light always have that sour, sweeter sort of thing going on.
[28:34.980 --> 28:36.980]  Let's get back into this email. It keeps going. It says,
[28:36.980 --> 28:43.980]  This video is saying that the plant can put out different terpenes at the top where it is more prone to insects, including limonene.
[28:43.980 --> 28:48.980]  At the bottom, it may put out more bitter terpenes to keep grazing mammals away.
[28:48.980 --> 28:53.980]  I thought that was pretty cool and it shows that you are on to something with your theory.
[28:53.980 --> 28:56.980]  I like that a lot and that makes a lot of sense.
[28:56.980 --> 29:02.980]  If you think about grazing animals, anything from a chicken to a fucking pig or a cow,
[29:02.980 --> 29:07.980]  anything that would come around and eat the bottom of a plant, it makes it taste bitter so that cow goes chomp chomp.
[29:07.980 --> 29:10.980]  That tastes like shit. I don't want none of that and it walks away from it.
[29:10.980 --> 29:14.980]  But up at the top, you're going to get completely different attackers, spider mites.
[29:14.980 --> 29:16.980]  They're going to be up there at the top.
[29:16.980 --> 29:19.980]  It makes that limonene so when the spider mites go up there, they go,
[29:19.980 --> 29:22.980]  This is sour, bro. I don't want to be up here. And they take off.
[29:22.980 --> 29:27.980]  I love that you gave me some feedback and I love that I've got some scientific support here.
[29:27.980 --> 29:31.980]  It says, keep putting out that great content from the Smokin' Muskogan.
[29:31.980 --> 29:38.980]  Then it says, P.S. The video is Terpenes and Marijuana Explained with Dr. Jake Felice.
[29:38.980 --> 29:41.980]  So if anybody else out there would like some supplemental terpene education,
[29:41.980 --> 29:47.980]  check out Terpenes and Marijuana Explained by Dr. Jake Felice.
[29:47.980 --> 29:51.980]  It sounds like I may be watching that video when I'm done recording here.
[29:51.980 --> 29:54.980]  Hey, Smokin' Muskogan, thank you for the great feedback.
[29:54.980 --> 30:00.980]  I love hearing that somebody out there supported some of my wild cannabis theories.
[30:00.980 --> 30:04.980]  Alright, I've been going for a minute, but I've got one more message that I want to read.
[30:04.980 --> 30:07.980]  Let's see, this one says, What's happened in Rostejef?
[30:07.980 --> 30:11.980]  I just wanted to reach out and give you a follow-up to a question you read on the podcast
[30:11.980 --> 30:14.980]  regarding an M-dog hermaphrodite.
[30:14.980 --> 30:17.980]  So I did chop her down at week 6 and you were right.
[30:17.980 --> 30:19.980]  It was loaded with seeds.
[30:19.980 --> 30:23.980]  I remember saying that if you can see a few seeds on the outside of that bud,
[30:23.980 --> 30:26.980]  it is probably loaded up on the inside.
[30:26.980 --> 30:29.980]  It sounds like I was correct. It was loaded with seeds.
[30:29.980 --> 30:31.980]  Let's see.
[30:31.980 --> 30:36.980]  And it also seeded a Swamp Boys shockey plant I had near her.
[30:36.980 --> 30:39.980]  That was a rough sentence, but we got through it together.
[30:39.980 --> 30:44.980]  I run that M-dog perpetually, and the reason I wanted to discuss this with you
[30:44.980 --> 30:47.980]  is I feel that I have experienced genetic drift.
[30:47.980 --> 30:52.980]  I've done a podcast about genetic drift, and briefly, no, that's not what is happening.
[30:53.980 --> 30:57.980]  We can explain genetic drift again, but that is not what genetic drift is.
[30:57.980 --> 31:01.980]  It says, I know you've discussed this in a couple of episodes, and I feel I have explained this.
[31:01.980 --> 31:05.980]  I stated the M-dog. I started the M-dog back in April of 2019,
[31:05.980 --> 31:09.980]  and I've been cloning her before I send her into flower.
[31:09.980 --> 31:13.980]  Not cloning it. Okay, so you're cutting a clone, letting it veg,
[31:13.980 --> 31:16.980]  cutting clones from that, then putting that big plant into flower.
[31:16.980 --> 31:18.980]  That's basically how we keep a plant around.
[31:18.980 --> 31:21.980]  It's similar to doing a mom plant. You just flower out that mom.
[31:21.980 --> 31:23.980]  So she's running for a little over a year.
[31:23.980 --> 31:26.980]  Then I had that one hermie that I sent you the question on.
[31:26.980 --> 31:31.980]  Then the following two plants also hermed on the same spots, the lower branches.
[31:31.980 --> 31:36.980]  I run organics, and I didn't have any light leaks, so I'm thinking this was genetic drift.
[31:36.980 --> 31:38.980]  What do you think?
[31:38.980 --> 31:43.980]  I don't have enough data on your grow to have a solid opinion,
[31:43.980 --> 31:46.980]  but I think that the plant has always been a herm,
[31:46.980 --> 31:50.980]  and you are just now giving it the proper conditions to express that trait.
[31:50.980 --> 31:52.980]  Maybe. That is my assumption.
[31:52.980 --> 31:55.980]  Plants don't tend to just become herm.
[31:55.980 --> 31:58.980]  I don't think that's a genetic drift thing.
[31:58.980 --> 32:03.980]  I think you're just now giving it the environment, the situation, whatever.
[32:03.980 --> 32:06.980]  There's something that is triggering it to herm that it never had before.
[32:06.980 --> 32:09.980]  So what is different now that wasn't different before?
[32:09.980 --> 32:11.980]  Is the soil a little bit hotter? Is the soil weaker?
[32:11.980 --> 32:15.980]  Is your feed more rich? Is the room more humid? Is it too hot?
[32:15.980 --> 32:18.980]  There could be any number of factors deciding,
[32:18.980 --> 32:21.980]  making this plant decide that now I want to be a herm.
[32:21.980 --> 32:24.980]  So it says, do you think cloning over and over again for a year
[32:24.980 --> 32:26.980]  caused her to just say, fuck this?
[32:26.980 --> 32:28.980]  I'm really curious to see what you think.
[32:28.980 --> 32:30.980]  Thank you so much for your support.
[32:30.980 --> 32:32.980]  I'm on Patreon as Buzzards Bay.
[32:32.980 --> 32:35.980]  Hey, Buzzards Bay, thank you for the question.
[32:35.980 --> 32:38.980]  I really don't have a definitive answer other than
[32:38.980 --> 32:42.980]  I think that you just finally gave this plant the environment to hermaphrodite.
[32:42.980 --> 32:44.980]  You've been running it for a year.
[32:44.980 --> 32:46.980]  I don't know how many crops you've had before that,
[32:46.980 --> 32:49.980]  but I'm going to assume that the first time you ran it,
[32:49.980 --> 32:51.980]  it's like a first date.
[32:51.980 --> 32:53.980]  The first time you go out, first time you ran this plant,
[32:53.980 --> 32:56.980]  first time you took this girl out, you were real polite, real gentle.
[32:56.980 --> 32:58.980]  You followed the book. You read all the instructions.
[32:58.980 --> 33:01.980]  You did the cool guy, kind guy, polite guy move.
[33:01.980 --> 33:02.980]  Did all that shit, right?
[33:02.980 --> 33:04.980]  The plant was happy with you and it put out.
[33:04.980 --> 33:06.980]  The second time you got cocky, you're like,
[33:06.980 --> 33:08.980]  it put out the first time, watch me this time.
[33:08.980 --> 33:09.980]  You were kind of a dick.
[33:09.980 --> 33:11.980]  I'm not saying you're a dick. I'm just saying this is what we do.
[33:11.980 --> 33:13.980]  You got too comfortable with the plant.
[33:13.980 --> 33:15.980]  You didn't open the car door right after dinner
[33:15.980 --> 33:18.980]  when you're walking that plant out to the car after you ate.
[33:18.980 --> 33:20.980]  Last time you opened the car door and made sure she was in there comfortably,
[33:20.980 --> 33:22.980]  made sure that her dress wasn't hanging out of the car door.
[33:22.980 --> 33:25.980]  You tucked her dress in, closed the door nice and gently,
[33:25.980 --> 33:27.980]  farted while you were out of the car, ran around the car,
[33:27.980 --> 33:29.980]  got to your door, made sure the fart smell was gone.
[33:29.980 --> 33:30.980]  Then you got in.
[33:30.980 --> 33:32.980]  The second time you went on the date, you guys,
[33:32.980 --> 33:34.980]  after dinner you just fucking opened your own car door
[33:34.980 --> 33:36.980]  and jumped in. You farted in the car.
[33:36.980 --> 33:37.980]  That's what happens to guys.
[33:37.980 --> 33:40.980]  We go real careful. We follow the book the first time.
[33:40.980 --> 33:42.980]  That second time, we get kind of cocky
[33:42.980 --> 33:44.980]  and we forget that there's a lot of steps and a lot of rules.
[33:44.980 --> 33:48.980]  So I'm assuming that maybe the first time you were real, real careful with this plant.
[33:48.980 --> 33:51.980]  You're like, she's new. She takes this long to flower.
[33:51.980 --> 33:53.980]  I got to learn her. I got to figure her out.
[33:53.980 --> 33:55.980]  The second time, you may have taken it for granted.
[33:55.980 --> 33:57.980]  Said, she put out real well the first time.
[33:57.980 --> 33:59.980]  I'm going back for more of that the second time,
[33:59.980 --> 34:02.980]  but you didn't take all the steps to get it to put out the way you expected it to.
[34:02.980 --> 34:05.980]  That may be the most crass description I've ever given on a podcast,
[34:05.980 --> 34:09.980]  but I think you understood exactly what the fuck I meant.
[34:09.980 --> 34:11.980]  All right. I hope I answered your question.
[34:11.980 --> 34:13.980]  I really think that that plant was probably a hermaphrodite the whole time,
[34:13.980 --> 34:17.980]  and you were just now giving it the opportunity to show you that trait.
[34:17.980 --> 34:20.980]  Buzzards Bay, thank you for the support on Patreon.
[34:20.980 --> 34:22.980]  And again, thank you for the great email.

[34:27.980 --> 34:31.980]  To the best of my knowledge, I feel like I am caught up on Patreon questions.
[34:31.980 --> 34:35.980]  If you've sent me a Patreon question up to, what is the date today?
[34:35.980 --> 34:37.980]  We are now at the 1st of August.
[34:37.980 --> 34:40.980]  If you sent me a Patreon question before the 1st of August,
