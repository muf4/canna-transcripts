[01:15.450 --> 01:20.450]  Ladies and gentlemen, before this intro gets too long, let's get right into it.
[01:20.450 --> 01:23.450]  Here's episode 325 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:35.790 --> 01:39.790]  If you're trying to get all that reclaim out of your rig so that you can use it,
[01:39.790 --> 01:41.790]  it's a good idea to make edibles out of it.
[01:41.790 --> 01:43.790]  If you want to dry it out and smoke it, you could do that,
[01:43.790 --> 01:46.790]  but edibles is probably the way to go if you're going to recycle your reclaim.
[01:46.790 --> 01:49.790]  The easiest way to get it out of the rig without destroying it
[01:49.790 --> 01:52.790]  is to run the tap water, get the tap water super hot,
[01:52.790 --> 01:56.790]  and then just fill the rig with hot water and pour it out into a container.
[01:56.790 --> 01:59.790]  If the rig and the water are really hot, it'll come out really easily.
[01:59.790 --> 02:02.790]  If it's cold, that shit's just going to stick and make a mess.
[02:02.790 --> 02:05.790]  If you put a solvent in there to loosen it up, you're going to ruin the reclaim.
[02:05.790 --> 02:09.790]  So the best way to get it out is probably just hot water and pour it into something and collect it.
[02:09.790 --> 02:11.790]  Maybe pour it onto some parchment.
[02:11.790 --> 02:14.790]  Might be your best bet. Not sure how to collect it that way.
[02:14.790 --> 02:16.790]  I honestly don't fuck with reclaim. I'm a little bit stuck up.
[02:16.790 --> 02:18.790]  I throw the reclaim away.
[02:18.790 --> 02:21.790]  Another good way to catch a reclaim, you guys, and make it more usable
[02:21.790 --> 02:24.790]  and to keep it from the water is a drop down.
[02:24.790 --> 02:25.790]  Simply put a drop down on your rig.
[02:25.790 --> 02:29.790]  A drop down is a piece that goes from the joint of your rig.
[02:29.790 --> 02:31.790]  It drops down at an angle, and then it goes back up,
[02:31.790 --> 02:33.790]  and you put your nail on the up part,
[02:33.790 --> 02:36.790]  and your reclaim will gather in the bottom of the drop down.
[02:36.790 --> 02:39.790]  Instead of making it into the water of your rig, it's more accessible,
[02:39.790 --> 02:43.790]  and it's easier to smoke from there than it is from the water.
[02:43.790 --> 02:47.790]  So that's what I would do with the reclaim if you were trying to use it.
[02:47.790 --> 02:50.790]  Jesse says, Chem 4, Chem D, or Chem 91?
[02:50.790 --> 02:53.790]  My answer is yes, please.
[02:53.790 --> 02:55.790]  But honestly, I like the Chem 4 because it's chunky.
[02:55.790 --> 02:57.790]  I like that.
[02:57.790 --> 03:01.790]  It smells like, I think it smells like when you open a can of tennis balls.
[03:01.790 --> 03:04.790]  A fresh can of tennis balls has a really certain smell.
[03:04.790 --> 03:09.790]  It's got a, I don't know, it smells like Chem 4,
[03:09.790 --> 03:11.790]  but it's got like a tires kind of a thing going on.
[03:11.790 --> 03:13.790]  I really like that.
[03:13.790 --> 03:17.790]  Chem D, I don't know that I've got enough experience with real Chem D to be honest.
[03:17.790 --> 03:23.790]  Chem 91, I love that nasty skunk, funk, terrible smell.
[03:23.790 --> 03:25.790]  I love that.
[03:25.790 --> 03:27.790]  So if I want to grow it, probably Chem 4.
[03:27.790 --> 03:29.790]  If I want to smoke it, Chem 91.
[03:29.790 --> 03:31.790]  If I need more information, Chem D.
[03:31.790 --> 03:33.790]  Fuck, marry, kill?
[03:33.790 --> 03:37.790]  Fuck Chem 4, marry Chem 91, and kill Chem D.
[03:37.790 --> 03:42.790]  Yes, we just played a round of fuck, marry, kill with cannabis strains, you guys.
[03:42.790 --> 03:47.790]  So the question was, what was your view on 11 on and 13 off to mimic the tropics?
[03:47.790 --> 03:52.790]  They're asking about light cycles, 11 hours on, 13 hours off for the plants to mimic the tropics.
[03:52.790 --> 03:54.790]  That's not a bad idea.
[03:54.790 --> 04:00.790]  It saves you an hour of electricity, which over a 65 day flowering cycle is 65 hours of light.
[04:00.790 --> 04:04.790]  For each bulb that you don't have to run, that cools your equipment a little bit.
[04:04.790 --> 04:11.790]  And also, when you're doing a pheno hunt, I think a longer dark period gives your plants more time to show a phenotypical expression.
[04:11.790 --> 04:13.790]  You'll see more variance.
[04:13.790 --> 04:15.790]  You'll see the plants actually do what they're supposed to do.
[04:15.790 --> 04:17.790]  It may affect your yield.
[04:17.790 --> 04:23.790]  It may affect positively or negatively, depending on your strain.
[04:23.790 --> 04:27.790]  I think it was DJ Short that was saying 11 on, 13 off.
[04:27.790 --> 04:29.790]  Yes, that's probably where you heard that.
[04:29.790 --> 04:34.790]  DJ Short on a high times forum on one of the panels on Free Weed.
[04:34.790 --> 04:35.790]  Free Weed!
[04:35.790 --> 04:37.790]  Probably on that podcast.
[04:37.790 --> 04:39.790]  It's probably where you heard that.
[04:39.790 --> 04:40.790]  It's not a bad idea.
[04:40.790 --> 04:44.790]  It'll save you, like I said, it'll save you one hour every day.
[04:44.790 --> 04:48.790]  And over a 63, 65 day flowering cycle, that's 65 hours worth of electricity.
[04:48.790 --> 04:52.790]  And if you're running four lights, that's 65 times four, is it 240?
[04:52.790 --> 04:54.790]  It's 270 fucking, right?
[04:54.790 --> 04:56.790]  260 hours of lighting that you're saving.
[04:56.790 --> 04:57.790]  That's quick math.
[04:57.790 --> 04:58.790]  Don't fucking hold me to it.
[04:58.790 --> 05:00.790]  But yeah, it's not a bad idea.
[05:00.790 --> 05:03.790]  It'll show more phenotypical expression.
[05:03.790 --> 05:05.790]  I think it's not a bad idea.
[05:05.790 --> 05:07.790]  It'll bring out more flavors and more turps too.
[05:09.790 --> 05:11.790]  The question is, question for you Rasta Man.
[05:11.790 --> 05:13.790]  When you do an open pollination with a single male,
[05:13.790 --> 05:17.790]  do you put it in the room at the same time as your girls when you start flowering?
[05:17.790 --> 05:19.790]  No, that's very strain dependent.
[05:19.790 --> 05:26.790]  Something like Grateful Dog wants to be pollinated around day 25 of its life of flowering.
[05:26.790 --> 05:29.790]  Lemon Skunk wants pollen closer to day 32.
[05:29.790 --> 05:34.790]  So I've got to put the male in the room to get him pollinating,
[05:34.790 --> 05:37.790]  to get him flowering, to get him pollinating,
[05:37.790 --> 05:40.790]  to where when the Grateful Dog plant wants pollen
[05:40.790 --> 05:42.790]  and the Lemon Skunk plant wants pollen,
[05:42.790 --> 05:45.790]  that male has got pollen ready for them.
[05:45.790 --> 05:48.790]  Also, I've got to time it to where the Lemon Skunk plant
[05:48.790 --> 05:51.790]  and that Grateful Dog plant are ready for pollen on the same day.
[05:51.790 --> 05:55.790]  So that means I've got to put the male in the room a few days ahead of time,
[05:55.790 --> 05:56.790]  just a couple days.
[05:56.790 --> 05:57.790]  It depends on what plants I'm working with.
[05:57.790 --> 06:00.790]  I know which plants I need to do this with because I've done it a few times now.
[06:00.790 --> 06:03.790]  I've got to put the male in the room first, get him going.
[06:03.790 --> 06:05.790]  I kind of put him in a separate space.
[06:05.790 --> 06:06.790]  He's far from all the other ones.
[06:06.790 --> 06:09.790]  He's isolated, so he's in there flowering.
[06:09.790 --> 06:13.790]  Then I will put the Lemon Skunk in there because it's got to get ahead of everybody.
[06:13.790 --> 06:17.790]  Then I will put, I'll wait like, what is it, six or seven days,
[06:17.790 --> 06:20.790]  let the Lemon Skunk get ahead, then we'll throw that Grateful Dog in there.
[06:20.790 --> 06:23.790]  So now they're actually perfectly timed now.
[06:23.790 --> 06:25.790]  It sounds like one went in way late and one went in early,
[06:25.790 --> 06:28.790]  but when pollen comes, this one's going to have fat pistils.
[06:28.790 --> 06:29.790]  The buds are going to start forming.
[06:29.790 --> 06:33.790]  It's a shorter, squattier indica plant, so it's not going to get as tall.
[06:33.790 --> 06:35.790]  It's not going to get, it doesn't take as much time to finish,
[06:35.790 --> 06:37.790]  so it needs to be pollinated earlier.
[06:37.790 --> 06:40.790]  That Lemon Skunk plant needs a little more time to stretch out
[06:40.790 --> 06:43.790]  and give me all those little bud sites to create seed sites.
[06:43.790 --> 06:46.790]  So yeah, I've got to stagger them.
[06:46.790 --> 06:49.790]  The boy goes in first, then the Lemon Skunk, then the Grateful Dog.
[06:49.790 --> 06:51.790]  Depends on what else I'm working with.
[06:58.090 --> 07:01.090]  The question is, I've got seeds available on dankseed.store,
[07:01.090 --> 07:04.090]  and somebody wants to know if the Blueberry Cookies packs are all the same,
[07:04.090 --> 07:08.090]  or is the S1 pack different than the one not labeled S1?
[07:08.090 --> 07:10.090]  I'm not sure how they've got them labeled on the website.
[07:10.090 --> 07:12.090]  I need to take a look and see what they've got going on up there.
[07:12.090 --> 07:17.090]  But this is a good opportunity to talk about S1s and R1s.
[07:17.090 --> 07:21.090]  Now, this is a label for Femini seeds.
[07:21.090 --> 07:26.090]  Normally you see things like F1 or F2 or BX or IBL.
[07:26.090 --> 07:31.090]  Now you're starting to see on Femini seed packages, you're seeing R1 and S1.
[07:31.090 --> 07:33.090]  R1 means a reversal.
[07:33.090 --> 07:39.090]  An R1 means I reversed a plant, and I used its pollen on a different plant.
[07:39.090 --> 07:41.090]  It's a reversal.
[07:41.090 --> 07:46.090]  An S1 is if I were to reverse a plant and put that pollen on the same cultivar.
[07:46.090 --> 07:48.090]  So that is selfing.
[07:48.090 --> 07:51.090]  It's only selfing if you're putting the pollen on itself.
[07:51.090 --> 07:55.090]  If you're putting the pollen on something else, it's a reversal.
[07:55.090 --> 07:57.090]  An S1 is a selfed one.
[07:57.090 --> 08:03.090]  It's only going to have that plant's genes in it, no other genetics, no other adulterations.
[08:03.090 --> 08:04.090]  It's just going to be that.
[08:04.090 --> 08:06.090]  It is going to be just blueberry cookies.
[08:06.090 --> 08:10.090]  I took the blueberry cookies girl, and I put reversed blueberry cookies pollen on there,
[08:10.090 --> 08:11.090]  and it is selfed.
[08:11.090 --> 08:14.090]  That is seeds of itself, S1.
[08:14.090 --> 08:18.090]  Now, reversal, if I take that blueberry cookies pollen just as I did,
[08:18.090 --> 08:21.090]  and I throw it on the platinum tangy, I have now made a reversal.
[08:21.090 --> 08:23.090]  That's not a self because I've opened up the line.
[08:23.090 --> 08:24.090]  I put something else in there.
[08:24.090 --> 08:30.090]  So that's the difference between an R1 and an S1, a reversal and a selfed plant.
[08:30.090 --> 08:36.090]  So the conversation was we were talking about reversing plants and using reversed males
[08:36.090 --> 08:40.090]  or reversed females for breeding and what the future of that holds.
[08:40.090 --> 08:44.090]  And then I was making sure to support the idea of making feminized seeds.
[08:44.090 --> 08:45.090]  There is a reason for fem seeds.
[08:45.090 --> 08:47.090]  A lot of people hate on fem seeds.
[08:47.090 --> 08:48.090]  A lot of people bash fem seeds.
[08:48.090 --> 08:50.090]  It's not a lot of people's cup of tea.
[08:50.090 --> 08:53.090]  A lot of people feel about fem seed the way I feel about autoflower seeds.
[08:53.090 --> 08:55.090]  So I completely understand it.
[08:55.090 --> 08:59.090]  But there is a reason and a good purpose for feminized seed.
[08:59.090 --> 09:04.090]  And here is the reason why I recently reversed a clone of blueberry skunk.
[09:05.090 --> 09:07.090]  I grow for a large facility.
[09:08.090 --> 09:13.090]  Some of those flowers for that facility were smoked by a very well-known breeder
[09:13.090 --> 09:16.090]  who has been in this game for longer than I could ever imagine.
[09:16.090 --> 09:17.090]  He started this shit.
[09:17.090 --> 09:18.090]  He didn't start it.
[09:18.090 --> 09:21.090]  He was one of the first few, and he's still killing it.
[09:21.090 --> 09:22.090]  He's ahead of the game now.
[09:22.090 --> 09:26.090]  I don't know if I'm supposed to disclose who I did this project for or not
[09:26.090 --> 09:28.090]  because I was actually commissioned to make these seeds.
[09:28.090 --> 09:37.090]  Anyhow, this breeder who used to be well-known on HashChurch and IGC
[09:37.090 --> 09:42.090]  and OvergrowTheGovernment.com, this guy was a pioneer.
[09:42.090 --> 09:43.090]  Yes, he was a pioneer.
[09:43.090 --> 09:45.090]  He's one of those guys.
[09:45.090 --> 09:50.090]  So this guy smoked some of the flowers that came from my facility,
[09:50.090 --> 09:52.090]  and he said, Holy shit, that's got such an amazing flavor.
[09:52.090 --> 09:53.090]  What is that?
[09:53.090 --> 09:57.090]  And we told him what it was, and he said, Can I have some seeds of it?
[09:57.090 --> 09:58.090]  And we said, There are no seeds of that.
[09:58.090 --> 09:59.090]  It's kind of a clone only.
[09:59.090 --> 10:01.090]  And he said, Make me some seeds.
[10:01.090 --> 10:04.090]  And that became my job.
[10:04.090 --> 10:08.090]  I reversed it to make seeds for him because he thinks it's got some amazing,
[10:08.090 --> 10:12.090]  very unique turps, and he wants to use it in his breeding projects.
[10:12.090 --> 10:16.090]  Now, he is in another country, so there's no way to get him a plant safely,
[10:16.090 --> 10:18.090]  legally, discreetly.
[10:18.090 --> 10:21.090]  I can't get a clone of the blueberry cookies to him.
[10:21.090 --> 10:23.090]  We can very easily get him some seeds.
[10:23.090 --> 10:25.090]  He can get the seeds to his own country.
[10:25.090 --> 10:27.090]  It's legal for him to travel there with seeds.
[10:27.090 --> 10:30.090]  It is illegal for him to travel there with a clone.
[10:30.090 --> 10:31.090]  So he can take the seeds.
[10:31.090 --> 10:34.090]  So I made the seeds.
[10:34.090 --> 10:36.090]  He wants to work with that.
[10:36.090 --> 10:38.090]  So all I did was reverse the blueberry cookies.
[10:38.090 --> 10:39.090]  I used that pollen.
[10:39.090 --> 10:43.090]  I put it back on a blueberry cookies female, and I made S1 seeds.
[10:44.090 --> 10:48.090]  Now, that's going to show very close representations of that blueberry cookies.
[10:48.090 --> 10:50.090]  It's going to be just like it.
[10:50.090 --> 10:52.090]  You're going to see a little bit variance closer to mom, closer to dad,
[10:52.090 --> 10:56.090]  but most of them are going to be the blueberry cookies that I started with.
[10:56.090 --> 10:58.090]  Now, he's got that blueberry cookies,
[10:58.090 --> 11:02.090]  and I didn't adulterate it by adding another male or another female to the mix.
[11:02.090 --> 11:06.090]  And that's what would have happened if I would have taken a rise or whatever
[11:06.090 --> 11:09.090]  other male I've got and put pollen on there.
[11:09.090 --> 11:12.090]  I would have adulterated it and watered down that original genetic.
[11:12.090 --> 11:15.090]  But now he's got the original blueberry cookie seeds.
[11:15.090 --> 11:19.090]  It's an S1 version, a selfed version of the blueberry cookies.
[11:19.090 --> 11:20.090]  It's unadulterated.
[11:20.090 --> 11:24.090]  So that is the advantage of working with feminized seeds.
[11:24.090 --> 11:26.090]  The main advantage, in my opinion.
[11:26.090 --> 11:30.090]  Also, man, sometimes you just want to breed some shit,
[11:30.090 --> 11:33.090]  and you don't have a male of it, and the best way to do it is to reverse it.
[11:33.090 --> 11:37.090]  I know that what comes from that blueberry cookies reversal is going to be amazing
[11:37.090 --> 11:40.090]  because I've seen what the female blueberry cookies plant does,
[11:40.090 --> 11:41.090]  and I know it's phenomenal.
[11:41.090 --> 11:43.090]  So I already know that what I use it for,
[11:43.090 --> 11:47.090]  you can already see 50-50 what's going to happen because you're working with two females.
[11:47.090 --> 11:52.090]  So that's the advantage of making feminized seeds.
[11:54.090 --> 11:56.090]  You hated on fem seeds for years,
[11:56.090 --> 11:59.090]  but they definitely speed up your selection process by years.
[11:59.090 --> 12:01.090]  And for people in Colorado now,
[12:01.090 --> 12:07.090]  we're getting limited on plant counts lower and lower every time, every year.
[12:07.090 --> 12:08.090]  They drop our plant count.
[12:08.090 --> 12:10.090]  We used to be able to grow tons of fucking plants.
[12:10.090 --> 12:15.090]  And now I've got empty grow rooms because we can't grow as many plants as we used to be allowed to grow.
[12:15.090 --> 12:17.090]  I just unplug shit, gave grow equipment away.
[12:17.090 --> 12:19.090]  We're down to very low numbers of plants.
[12:19.090 --> 12:22.090]  If they keep going lower, it's not even going to be worth having a light.
[12:22.090 --> 12:25.090]  So people that are limited to six plants,
[12:25.090 --> 12:29.090]  they want all six of the seeds that they pop to be female.
[12:29.090 --> 12:30.090]  They don't have time to fuck with a male.
[12:30.090 --> 12:34.090]  They can't run six because they think they're going to flower six.
[12:34.090 --> 12:35.090]  They've got a space.
[12:35.090 --> 12:36.090]  They've got six pots.
[12:36.090 --> 12:37.090]  They grow that boy.
[12:37.090 --> 12:38.090]  Fuck.
[12:38.090 --> 12:40.090]  Now I got to wait till the whole next cycle to run six.
[12:40.090 --> 12:41.090]  I'm wasting space.
[12:41.090 --> 12:47.090]  So, and if they can't run extra, they can't run 10 and then call the boys because now they're already over their limit.
[12:47.090 --> 12:48.090]  So six is the limit.
[12:48.090 --> 12:49.090]  They got to run all six.
[12:49.090 --> 12:51.090]  So that's why fem seeds are good for those folks.
[12:52.090 --> 12:53.090]  Unrelated a bit.
[12:53.090 --> 12:56.090]  I have a lot of pure sativas I'm preserving and seeding for future generations.
[12:56.090 --> 12:58.090]  Some of these males are auto flowering.
[12:58.090 --> 13:00.090]  I get rid of those dudes first.
[13:00.090 --> 13:01.090]  Yes.
[13:01.090 --> 13:03.090]  Any dude that auto flowers, you get the fuck rid of them.
[13:03.090 --> 13:04.090]  Stress him.
[13:04.090 --> 13:05.090]  Get him root bound.
[13:05.090 --> 13:06.090]  Overfeed him.
[13:06.090 --> 13:08.090]  If he starts to auto flower, get rid of him.
[13:08.090 --> 13:13.090]  See, that's why it takes me so long to find a new male, you guys, because I abused the shit out of him before I take it to a breeding room.
[13:14.090 --> 13:16.090]  Also, here's a rant that I like to give.
[13:17.090 --> 13:22.090]  Say you've got a pack of 10 seeds and if you're going to breed, I hope you're using more than 10 seeds, but 10 is a good number to talk about.
[13:22.090 --> 13:25.090]  Say you've got 10 seeds and you're going to breed out of that pack.
[13:25.090 --> 13:26.090]  Say you're like just a hobby breeder.
[13:26.090 --> 13:28.090]  You're like, oh man, I really want to start breeding.
[13:28.090 --> 13:30.090]  I'm going to buy a pack of Rasta Jeff's cream.
[13:30.090 --> 13:32.090]  My podcast today is going to be about the cream.
[13:32.090 --> 13:33.090]  I want to breed.
[13:33.090 --> 13:34.090]  I want to get a pack of the cream and I want to breed.
[13:34.090 --> 13:35.090]  So you get a 10 pack.
[13:35.090 --> 13:40.090]  You're going to get, hopefully science dictates you're going to get five males, five females or somewhere in that.
[13:40.090 --> 13:43.090]  You're going to get four and six or five and five, somewhere around there, right?
[13:43.090 --> 13:49.090]  So hopefully you've got, I'm going to say for the sake of my ramble here that we got five males and five females.
[13:49.090 --> 13:52.090]  If you're looking for a male to breed, you put those five females aside.
[13:52.090 --> 13:53.090]  They don't count right now.
[13:53.090 --> 13:54.090]  They're in another room.
[13:54.090 --> 13:55.090]  We're talking about the boys.
[13:55.090 --> 14:00.090]  That first male that flowers, the first one that starts dropping his balls real big, cut him down, throw him away.
[14:00.090 --> 14:01.090]  You don't want to breed with that one at all.
[14:01.090 --> 14:03.090]  At all, at all, get rid of him.
[14:03.090 --> 14:06.090]  That's the male that's going to dominate your cross.
[14:06.090 --> 14:10.090]  That is the one that is going to be just a reproduction of that plant to everything you breed.
[14:10.090 --> 14:16.090]  If you breed it to star dog, if you breed it to daybreaker, if you breed it to platinum tangy, it's all going to come out like male plant.
[14:16.090 --> 14:18.090]  It's just going to ruin your crosses.
[14:18.090 --> 14:19.090]  It's going to make hemp.
[14:19.090 --> 14:20.090]  It's going to be a boy.
[14:20.090 --> 14:24.090]  It's just going to be, it's just going to be that male all over, all over everything.
[14:24.090 --> 14:26.090]  So the second one, you're getting a little closer to what you want.
[14:26.090 --> 14:35.090]  But if you've got, if you've got five boys, I usually find myself using the third or fourth, the third or fourth out of five are usually what I use.
[14:35.090 --> 14:41.090]  The first two that go to dominant that third one, he's usually the one that's got the right structure and the right shape.
[14:41.090 --> 14:43.090]  The fourth one is usually right behind there.
[14:43.090 --> 14:45.090]  And the fifth one is usually too tall.
[14:45.090 --> 14:47.090]  That boy that is way fucking tall.
[14:47.090 --> 14:48.090]  I get rid of him.
[14:48.090 --> 14:49.090]  He's going to be real dominant.
[14:49.090 --> 14:51.090]  Also, if he likes to stretch.
[14:51.090 --> 14:52.090]  So say your girls are two feet tall.
[14:52.090 --> 14:54.090]  You'll have a boy that's three feet tall.
[14:54.090 --> 14:55.090]  I just get rid of him.
[14:55.090 --> 14:59.090]  I've noticed that he just makes tall, tall plants.
[14:59.090 --> 15:00.090]  He just wants, he makes plants.
[15:00.090 --> 15:04.090]  It's one that they want to get up above everybody so that when the pollen comes down, it rains down.
[15:04.090 --> 15:06.090]  But his girls also do that.
[15:06.090 --> 15:10.090]  Also, it feels like, so you got a 10 pack.
[15:10.090 --> 15:11.090]  You pull out five girls.
[15:11.090 --> 15:12.090]  You got five left.
[15:12.090 --> 15:14.090]  Those first two boys get rid of them.
[15:14.090 --> 15:15.090]  Three and four.
[15:15.090 --> 15:17.090]  Those are your breeding prospects.
[15:17.090 --> 15:20.090]  Most likely number five, he's going to be tall and goofy.
[15:20.090 --> 15:22.090]  He's probably not the one you want to use.
[15:22.090 --> 15:23.090]  All right.
[15:23.090 --> 15:27.090]  That's just from years of breeding and experimenting and going through boy plants.
[15:27.090 --> 15:29.090]  That's what I have learned from looking.
[15:29.090 --> 15:31.090]  All right.
[15:31.090 --> 15:32.090]  Genetic drift, bro.
[15:32.090 --> 15:33.090]  I don't believe in genetic drift.
[15:33.090 --> 15:34.090]  I don't think I've never seen it.
[15:34.090 --> 15:36.090]  I've never experienced it.
[15:36.090 --> 15:41.090]  I've seen people fuck up plants and try to take unhealthy clones that are shitty just because they're unhealthy.
[15:41.090 --> 15:45.090]  But then I have been given those types of clones.
[15:45.090 --> 15:47.090]  I'm not saying I'm looking at these clones and these clones are great.
[15:47.090 --> 15:52.090]  I've been given terrible clones and I've revived them and then cloned off of that a hundred times.
[15:52.090 --> 15:53.090]  And they've been stellar.
[15:53.090 --> 15:58.090]  Dude, the flow that I work with, let's talk about flow.
[15:58.090 --> 16:00.090]  My flow has been through hell and back.
[16:00.090 --> 16:06.090]  I've had flow since 2007, 2008.
[16:06.090 --> 16:08.090]  Yeah.
[16:08.090 --> 16:09.090]  And that bitch puts out still.
[16:09.090 --> 16:11.090]  She has been through house moves.
[16:11.090 --> 16:13.090]  She's been through me.
[16:13.090 --> 16:19.090]  One time I got the flu and I was so sick that I looked up at my garden and I was like, that needs water.
[16:19.090 --> 16:21.090]  And I threw up and went back to bed.
[16:21.090 --> 16:23.090]  That's how much I cared about my plants because I was so fucking sick.
[16:23.090 --> 16:26.090]  And that flow, she almost went, but she's back.
[16:26.090 --> 16:27.090]  Cloned off of her.
[16:27.090 --> 16:28.090]  She's alive.
[16:28.090 --> 16:30.090]  And that flow is amazing.
[16:30.090 --> 16:33.090]  If any of my plants were going to show me some genetic drift flow would have told me about it.
[16:33.090 --> 16:36.090]  She would have been like, look, genetic drift.
[16:36.090 --> 16:37.090]  Not happening, dude.
[16:37.090 --> 16:42.090]  I would have experienced it by now because when I was a new grower, I was a horrible fucking cloner.
[16:42.090 --> 16:46.090]  My grow game was on point from the beginning, but my clone game was weak.
[16:46.090 --> 16:47.090]  I couldn't clone for a long time.
[16:47.090 --> 16:50.090]  Shout out to my friend who got me into easy cloning and taught me how to clone.
[16:50.090 --> 16:53.090]  Then shout out to my new friend who really stepped up my fucking cloning game.
[16:53.090 --> 16:56.090]  So I don't really think that I believe too much in genetic drift.
[16:56.090 --> 16:58.090]  That's not something that I support.
[16:59.090 --> 17:00.090]  You get some new gear.
[17:00.090 --> 17:01.090]  The sound is great.
[17:01.090 --> 17:03.090]  No, this is actually, thanks for the compliment on the sound gear.
[17:03.090 --> 17:05.090]  This is the podcast equipment.
[17:05.090 --> 17:06.090]  This is what I record the podcast on.
[17:06.090 --> 17:10.090]  I'm just running into a Mackey mixer.
[17:10.090 --> 17:13.090]  I got the Mackey 1402 that I've had for a hundred years.
[17:13.090 --> 17:19.090]  Then I run that into a DBX compressor because I like the compression and the gate.
[17:19.090 --> 17:21.090]  Watch, this is what it really sounds like in this room.
[17:22.090 --> 17:24.090]  You hear all that fucking noise?
[17:24.090 --> 17:25.090]  Can you hear the hum?
[17:26.090 --> 17:27.090]  That's my nose.
[17:29.090 --> 17:30.090]  But watch.
[17:32.090 --> 17:36.090]  Oh yeah, then you turn on a little compression and sound gate and it's fucking clean, right?
[17:36.090 --> 17:38.090]  Yeah, none of that crap.
[17:38.090 --> 17:39.090]  It's just the podcast gear.
[17:39.090 --> 17:43.090]  I've got a compressor here, a DBX compressor, a two channel DBX compressor.
[17:43.090 --> 17:47.090]  That runs into a Tascam US 1200, which is what takes me digital.
[17:48.090 --> 17:52.090]  I've got a little preamp on the mixer that gives me a little turbo.
[17:52.090 --> 17:54.090]  It gives me plus 48 to make my mic a little hotter.
[17:54.090 --> 17:56.090]  I've got the gain up quite high.
[17:56.090 --> 17:57.090]  Quite high.
[17:57.090 --> 17:59.090]  I like the gain pretty high on my mic.
[17:59.090 --> 18:00.090]  It makes it so you can hear everything.
[18:00.090 --> 18:01.090]  I like it crispy.
[18:01.090 --> 18:06.090]  I got the bass turned up a little bit on my voice just because it gives it a little more boom and it makes me less nasally.
[18:06.090 --> 18:08.090]  You can hear I got some shit in the nose.
[18:08.090 --> 18:10.090]  It takes that out a little bit.
[18:10.090 --> 18:12.090]  I turn the compression up quite high.
[18:12.090 --> 18:14.090]  I got the gate quite high.
[18:15.090 --> 18:17.090]  Then I run through GarageBand.
[18:17.090 --> 18:18.090]  I don't think you guys hear.
[18:18.090 --> 18:20.090]  You do hear the GarageBand effects also.
[18:20.090 --> 18:23.090]  I just run a noise gate on GarageBand.
[18:23.090 --> 18:26.090]  Then there's a bass booster.
[18:26.090 --> 18:29.090]  I run two different tracks at the same time on GarageBand.
[18:29.090 --> 18:31.090]  They have two different effects on them.
[18:31.090 --> 18:32.090]  They layer and it just makes me sound.
[18:32.090 --> 18:35.090]  It makes it thicker and bolder, honestly, is all it really does.
[18:35.090 --> 18:37.090]  I don't run any exciters or de-essers or anything.
[18:37.090 --> 18:40.090]  I just try to keep it mostly simple.
[18:40.090 --> 18:41.090]  Thanks for the sound compliment.
[18:41.090 --> 18:43.090]  Thanks for letting me rant about my sound gear.
[18:43.090 --> 18:45.090]  I hope that made sense to somebody.
[18:45.090 --> 18:49.090]  John Henry 1060 says, how often do you change your cloner water?
[18:49.090 --> 18:51.090]  Honestly, I do not change the cloner water.
[18:51.090 --> 18:55.090]  Those clones are only in the cloner for 10, 12, maybe 14 days at the most.
[18:55.090 --> 18:57.090]  I don't feel the need to change the water.
[18:57.090 --> 19:00.090]  What I do is I add a whole bunch of clear res.
[19:00.090 --> 19:03.090]  I've got a 180 site cloner that I like to use.
[19:03.090 --> 19:05.090]  It's the Botanicare 180.
[19:05.090 --> 19:06.090]  I just prefer that one lately.
[19:06.090 --> 19:07.090]  It seems to be the most reliable.
[19:07.090 --> 19:08.090]  The pump is better.
[19:08.090 --> 19:09.090]  The sprayers are better.
[19:09.090 --> 19:11.090]  It doesn't clog up as much.
[19:11.090 --> 19:13.090]  I will put the water in the cloner to the desired level.
[19:13.090 --> 19:17.090]  I fill it just below the PVC halo.
[19:17.090 --> 19:19.090]  The water is touching the bottom of that.
[19:19.090 --> 19:22.090]  Then I add Clon-X, the purple Clon-X liquid solution.
[19:22.090 --> 19:27.090]  I add that until the EC is at 1.1 or 1.2.
[19:27.090 --> 19:29.090]  You go 1.0 to 1.2.
[19:29.090 --> 19:31.090]  Just hold your EC pen in there, pour in.
[19:31.090 --> 19:33.090]  Go ahead and pour in 250 mils.
[19:33.090 --> 19:37.090]  Spin your EC pen around in that water and see what the EC is.
[19:37.090 --> 19:40.090]  Then keep adding until you get it to about 1.0 to 1.2.
[19:40.090 --> 19:43.090]  Now you've got water with solution in there.
[19:43.090 --> 19:48.090]  Then cut your clones, dip them in the Clon-X, put them in the plugs, drop it in the cloner.
[19:48.090 --> 19:50.090]  Let it run for a little while.
[19:50.090 --> 19:53.090]  Then that purple shit is going to fall off of your clones.
[19:53.090 --> 19:55.090]  The purple Clon-X gel is going to fall into the water.
[19:55.090 --> 19:56.090]  Let it run for a couple hours.
[19:56.090 --> 19:58.090]  Go do some other shit and come back.
[19:58.090 --> 20:01.090]  Unplug it, pop it open, and check the pH.
[20:01.090 --> 20:03.090]  At that point, pH it to somewhere.
[20:03.090 --> 20:05.090]  6.0 is ideal.
[20:05.090 --> 20:08.090]  6.2 will work, but somewhere between 5.9 and 6.2.
[20:08.090 --> 20:11.090]  pH that shit to 5.9 and 6.2, and you will be ideal.
[20:11.090 --> 20:17.090]  Then add about 200 to 250 mils of Clear Res.
[20:17.090 --> 20:18.090]  Just pour it right in there.
[20:18.090 --> 20:19.090]  Clear Res.
[20:19.090 --> 20:21.090]  Then do that every five days.
[20:21.090 --> 20:25.090]  If you add the Clear Res every five days, you will not have to change your water.
[20:25.090 --> 20:27.090]  The Clear Res will take care of any problems.
[20:27.090 --> 20:28.090]  All right?
[20:28.090 --> 20:31.090]  Put some Clear Res in there, and you don't have to change the cloner water.
[20:31.090 --> 20:36.090]  Then when it's done, pour two cups of bleach in there and let it keep running for quite a while.
[20:37.090 --> 20:39.090]  Then dump it all out and clean it out, and you'll be fresh.
[20:39.090 --> 20:40.090]  Throw the clone plugs away.
[20:40.090 --> 20:44.090]  Buy new clone plugs unless you're using Permaclone clone collars.
[20:44.090 --> 20:46.090]  If you're using Permaclones, clean those out appropriately.
[20:46.090 --> 20:48.090]  They taught you how to do them, and you bought them.
[20:48.090 --> 20:50.090]  If you're using those, use those again.
[20:50.090 --> 20:52.090]  Shout out to my friends at Permaclone clone collars.
[20:52.090 --> 20:54.090]  If you're using the cheap ones, throw them away and buy new ones.
[20:54.090 --> 20:56.090]  I suggest you check out Permaclone.
[20:56.090 --> 20:59.090]  If you could get beans from any time and place, what would it be?
[21:01.490 --> 21:03.490]  That's such a crazy question.
[21:03.490 --> 21:08.490]  I'd like to fly around to three or five places in the 70s and get beans before shit was adulterated.
[21:08.490 --> 21:16.490]  I'd like to go to Thailand, Vietnam, Afghanistan, and some sort of South American stuff, but I don't know where.
[21:16.490 --> 21:19.490]  Or I'd like to have some of those seeds that ChemDog had.
[21:19.490 --> 21:22.490]  Those 13 beans that ChemDog had, I'd like to have 10 of those.
[21:25.760 --> 21:26.760]  All right, podcast, roll it.
[21:26.760 --> 21:31.760]  I want to thank you guys again for listening to an Instagram clip version of the Grow It From Your Heart podcast.
[21:31.760 --> 21:32.760]  Thanks for hanging out with me.
[21:32.760 --> 21:38.760]  I know the past couple of episodes have not been very Grow related, but I promise you the next few episodes will be very Grow intensive.
[21:38.760 --> 21:40.760]  It's just kind of the way things timed out for me.
[21:40.760 --> 21:43.760]  I had the opportunity to get Granny and Giddy on the show.
[21:43.760 --> 21:46.760]  Then I had this episode kind of put together already, so that's how they came out.
[21:46.760 --> 21:48.760]  I'll get back to the Grow lessons.
[21:48.760 --> 21:49.760]  We will get that going.
[21:49.760 --> 21:55.760]  I know a lot of people are looking forward to the Drying Cure episode, so I will get that out for you very soon.
[21:55.760 --> 21:57.760]  I'll be back on the Grow episodes Monday, you guys.
[21:58.760 --> 22:01.760]  Thanks for listening to a couple of episodes in a row that were filled with chatter.
[22:01.760 --> 22:04.760]  The show is cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[22:04.760 --> 22:06.760]  We've gotten a couple of conversations out of the way.
[22:06.760 --> 22:09.760]  I will get back on the education.
[22:11.760 --> 22:14.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, make sure you follow me on all the social media.
[22:14.760 --> 22:16.760]  I would appreciate it if you find me on Facebook.
