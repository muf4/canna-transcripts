[00:00.000 --> 00:02.680]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:02.680 --> 00:06.920]  It is time for Episode 390 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:06.920 --> 00:10.400]  This episode of the show is brought to you by Oregon Elite Seeds.
[00:10.400 --> 00:15.000]  That's right, Oregon Elite Seeds, North America's largest online seed retailer.
[00:15.000 --> 00:19.200]  If you need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds, and you can
[00:19.200 --> 00:25.600]  find them at www.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[00:25.600 --> 00:28.400]  You know I like to start the show off by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[00:28.400 --> 00:33.200]  Today, I'm taking dabs of Chem Brûlée Full Spectrum Extract from Green Dot Labs.
[00:33.200 --> 00:35.480]  This is copper chem and lemon brûlée.
[00:35.480 --> 00:39.800]  The aroma and flavor are described as rotten lemon rind and sour fuel.
[00:39.800 --> 00:41.200]  I would definitely agree with that.
[00:41.200 --> 00:45.280]  It is funky, it is gross, and it is also delicious all at the same time.
[00:45.280 --> 00:50.640]  I really like the texture, the aroma, the flavor, and I really enjoy the high from the
[00:50.640 --> 00:51.640]  Chem Brûlée.
[00:51.640 --> 00:54.360]  So big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[00:54.360 --> 00:56.520]  You may notice that my voice is a little bit funky.
[00:56.640 --> 01:00.760]  That's because I was at the Endo Expo peddling iRegenetic seeds all weekend.
[01:00.760 --> 01:02.320]  I got to talk to a lot of great people.
[01:02.320 --> 01:04.440]  I got to meet a lot of great people.
[01:04.440 --> 01:07.280]  We will talk about that in just a second.
[01:07.280 --> 01:11.720]  Before we talk about the Endo Expo, I want to share with you what I did this afternoon.
[01:11.720 --> 01:17.240]  This afternoon, I pollinated a female blueberry cookies plant and a female strawberry fields
[01:17.240 --> 01:21.480]  plant with pollen from a male buckeye banana plant.
[01:21.480 --> 01:24.600]  Now, some people may be curious, what is that buckeye banana?
[01:24.680 --> 01:30.280]  The buckeye banana is the Ohio Buckeye from Melvinetics, crossed to the Banana OG from
[01:30.280 --> 01:31.280]  Texas Kid.
[01:31.280 --> 01:35.520]  I've got some pollen from that plant, and I applied that to the blueberry cookies and
[01:35.520 --> 01:37.040]  the strawberry fields.
[01:37.040 --> 01:39.640]  I think those will make some very interesting crosses.
[01:39.640 --> 01:45.100]  I don't plan to release those seeds, at least not the F1s, maybe further generations.
[01:45.100 --> 01:49.520]  My initial goal here with this original pollination is to create a few seeds for myself to play
[01:49.520 --> 01:50.520]  with.
[01:50.520 --> 01:55.200]  I'm really excited to find a male from the blueberry cookies, buckeye banana cross.
[01:55.200 --> 02:00.160]  I'm hoping to find a male that stays kind of short, kind of squat, kind of branchy.
[02:00.160 --> 02:02.080]  I want tight internode spacing.
[02:02.080 --> 02:04.840]  I'm hoping to have big fat indica dominant leaves.
[02:04.840 --> 02:09.040]  I'm hoping to find a male that doesn't take a really long time to start producing pollen.
[02:09.040 --> 02:11.880]  I want sort of a shorter flowering plant at this time.
[02:11.880 --> 02:16.200]  I'm also hoping that that plant carries the aroma from the blueberry cookies, but then
[02:16.200 --> 02:18.960]  I want the colors from the buckeye purple.
[02:18.960 --> 02:22.920]  And I want the trichome content from the banana OG.
[02:22.920 --> 02:24.600]  So I know what I'm looking for in this male.
[02:24.600 --> 02:27.600]  I just have to find it in the amount of seeds that I create.
[02:27.600 --> 02:33.080]  I anticipate I've created about 30 to 50 seeds in my experience with the size plant that
[02:33.080 --> 02:34.360]  I pollinated.
[02:34.360 --> 02:38.480]  I didn't have as much pollen as I wish I would have had, but I feel like I did a pretty good
[02:38.480 --> 02:41.220]  job pollinating those little tiny plants.
[02:41.220 --> 02:43.400]  So in several weeks, those seeds will be done.
[02:43.400 --> 02:44.520]  I'll harvest the plants.
[02:44.520 --> 02:45.680]  I'll dry the plants.
[02:45.680 --> 02:46.680]  I'll crack up the buds.
[02:46.680 --> 02:47.880]  I'll get the seeds out.
[02:47.880 --> 02:49.040]  I'll pick a few seeds.
[02:49.040 --> 02:50.080]  I'll germinate them.
[02:50.080 --> 02:51.760]  I will grow them.
[02:51.760 --> 02:55.640]  Hopefully I find a super stud of a male in that first batch of seeds.
[02:55.640 --> 03:00.200]  Hopefully I find a couple of sexy females in that first batch of seeds.
[03:00.200 --> 03:04.840]  Based on what I see from that first batch of seeds, I will make my decisions on which
[03:04.840 --> 03:10.240]  plants I choose to pollinate with that new male plant, and I will also decide if I choose
[03:10.240 --> 03:14.520]  to make F2s or further generations of this seed line.
[03:14.520 --> 03:18.760]  I can't really make any commitments or get too big of an idea at this point in time because
[03:18.760 --> 03:20.360]  I don't know what I am creating.
[03:20.360 --> 03:21.760]  I like to have confidence.
[03:21.760 --> 03:23.280]  I like to believe in myself.
[03:23.280 --> 03:28.040]  I like to feel like I have a good intuition, but these plants may not breed well together.
[03:28.040 --> 03:29.160]  That is always an option.
[03:29.160 --> 03:32.960]  I may have made just a bunch of crap, so I need to grow them myself.
[03:32.960 --> 03:35.800]  I need to see what I have created before I get too excited.
[03:35.800 --> 03:39.740]  I don't need to put the cart in front of my horse and start thinking about where I'm going
[03:39.740 --> 03:43.160]  to sprinkle the pollen from a plant that hasn't been selected yet.
[03:43.520 --> 03:44.720]  I can't make any decisions.
[03:44.720 --> 03:50.200]  I can't make any future plans with this project until the pollination creates seeds, the seeds
[03:50.200 --> 03:54.280]  are grown, then I take a lot of notes, and then I know what I've got to work with.
[03:54.280 --> 03:58.480]  All right, podcast world, I've got one more thing I'd like to mention before we get to
[03:58.480 --> 04:02.360]  the main topic of the show, which of course is going to be the IndoExpo.
[04:02.360 --> 04:06.840]  I would like to announce that Iry Genetics is now a proud member of the Oregon Elite
[04:06.840 --> 04:08.280]  Seeds team.
[04:08.280 --> 04:14.120]  That's right, Oregon Elite Seeds, North America's largest online seed retailer, now carries
[04:14.120 --> 04:15.760]  Iry Genetics seeds.
[04:15.760 --> 04:19.200]  Make sure you check them out at OregonEliteSeeds.com.
[04:19.200 --> 04:25.600]  All right, let's jump into the main topic of this show, which is the IndoExpo.
[04:25.600 --> 04:31.040]  The IndoExpo is the world's largest indoor cannabis and hemp expo, and it landed in Denver
[04:31.040 --> 04:33.920]  on January 26th and 27th.
[04:33.920 --> 04:39.000]  I was lucky enough to be invited to be a vendor with Oregon Elite Seeds this year.
[04:39.000 --> 04:42.840]  The past couple of years, I have attended the IndoExpo as a visitor.
[04:42.840 --> 04:47.600]  I got to walk around and check out the expo, see all of the booths, see all of the vending,
[04:47.600 --> 04:49.240]  see what was going on in the entire place.
[04:49.240 --> 04:55.000]  I walked 100 miles each weekend, but this year I got to share a booth with my friends,
[04:55.000 --> 04:56.400]  Oregon Elite Seeds.
[04:56.400 --> 05:00.520]  Our friends from Oregon Elite Seeds hosted a booth and we brought several breeders to
[05:00.520 --> 05:01.820]  the booth with us.
[05:01.820 --> 05:06.340]  We had Always Be Flowering hanging out, we had Medtree Seeds hanging out with us, and
[05:06.340 --> 05:11.060]  over the weekend we had Dox Dank pass through, we had Shoreline Seeds pass through.
[05:11.060 --> 05:14.420]  We had a whole group of breeders at the booth all weekend long.
[05:14.420 --> 05:15.940]  It was a great time.
[05:15.940 --> 05:19.220]  It was my first time vending at a booth and I honestly thought that it was going to be
[05:19.220 --> 05:22.300]  really stressful, but parking was the hardest part.
[05:22.300 --> 05:26.020]  Once you got parked, all you had to do was carry your shit in and it all happened on
[05:26.020 --> 05:27.420]  its own.
[05:27.420 --> 05:31.340]  The IndoExpo moves all around the country and does shows every few months, and this
[05:31.340 --> 05:32.860]  was their 10th show.
[05:32.860 --> 05:36.100]  So they've gotten really good at organizing the event.
[05:36.100 --> 05:39.300]  Everyone knows where to go, everybody knows where to be, so it's not super confusing like
[05:39.300 --> 05:41.420]  some of the cannabis events tend to be.
[05:41.420 --> 05:42.420]  So that was great.
[05:42.420 --> 05:44.340]  So loading in was super easy.
[05:44.340 --> 05:48.260]  I started meeting people and making friends at 8 a.m. Saturday morning.
[05:48.260 --> 05:52.500]  We didn't get loaded into the building before people started coming up and asking questions
[05:52.500 --> 05:54.080]  and introducing themselves.
[05:54.080 --> 05:55.500]  I didn't waste any time.
[05:55.500 --> 05:58.780]  I got right to business and right in action, started shaking hands.
[05:58.780 --> 06:03.740]  I saw a lot of wonderful people this weekend at the IndoExpo.
[06:03.740 --> 06:04.860]  Let's get into that part.
[06:04.860 --> 06:06.620]  I saw a lot of old friends.
[06:06.620 --> 06:09.100]  There are some folks I only get to see at IndoExpos.
[06:09.100 --> 06:11.780]  There are some folks I only get to see at industry events.
[06:11.780 --> 06:15.820]  I miss a lot of those folks and it is a great time seeing all of your smiling faces.
[06:15.820 --> 06:18.660]  So I really enjoyed that part of the IndoExpo.
[06:18.660 --> 06:21.340]  Being stuck at a booth, I didn't get to travel around.
[06:21.340 --> 06:26.100]  Saturday, I left my booth one time to go hit the men's room and it honestly took me way
[06:26.100 --> 06:31.140]  too long to get away from my booth to the men's room and back because being a member
[06:31.140 --> 06:36.340]  of the Colorado cannabis community at a cannabis event, I was quite popular.
[06:36.340 --> 06:39.780]  I'm not trying to say I'm popular, but I know a lot of people at that venue and it took
[06:39.780 --> 06:44.060]  me a really long time to get from my booth to the men's room and back.
[06:44.060 --> 06:46.260]  I didn't want to be away from my booth for that long.
[06:46.260 --> 06:47.980]  I felt like I had abandoned ship.
[06:47.980 --> 06:51.420]  My logo, my iReed Genetics flag is hanging up on the wall and I'm not there.
[06:51.420 --> 06:52.940]  I don't like that feeling.
[06:52.940 --> 06:57.580]  So Saturday, I was away for maybe 20 minutes to go use the restroom and get right back.
[06:57.580 --> 06:59.460]  Then Sunday, I didn't even leave my booth.
[06:59.460 --> 07:01.020]  I had no reason to take off from the booth.
[07:01.020 --> 07:04.740]  I didn't have an opportunity to eat or drink anything because the booth was so busy.
[07:04.740 --> 07:07.260]  So honestly, there was no need to use the restroom.
[07:07.260 --> 07:11.860]  So what I'm getting at is I was at my booth the entire time, the entire weekend.
[07:11.860 --> 07:15.300]  And the good part about that is everybody knew where to find me.
[07:15.300 --> 07:19.620]  I posted up to social media, hey, I am at booth 414, come say what's up.
[07:19.620 --> 07:22.140]  So a lot of people stopped by and said, hello.
[07:22.140 --> 07:24.220]  I got to see so many friends.
[07:24.220 --> 07:27.620]  I got to see, of course, I got to see all of my expo friends, all my friends that I
[07:27.620 --> 07:29.460]  only see at industry events.
[07:29.460 --> 07:32.820]  I got to see people that I have not seen in a long time.
[07:32.820 --> 07:36.220]  I got to meet new people that I have never met before.
[07:36.220 --> 07:41.260]  I got to meet people I've been interacting with on social media, either Facebook or Instagram
[07:41.260 --> 07:43.260]  or whatever it is, for years.
[07:43.260 --> 07:44.580]  And I've never met them in person.
[07:44.580 --> 07:47.480]  I got to do some handshakes, some high fives, some hugs.
[07:47.480 --> 07:48.480]  That was really great.
[07:48.480 --> 07:52.000]  Got to see what people's smiles actually look like because you could post whatever you want
[07:52.060 --> 07:53.280]  on social media.
[07:53.280 --> 07:57.520]  I got to meet a lot of folks who listened to the podcast.
[07:57.520 --> 08:00.640]  A couple of the breeders next to me were like, man, a lot of people are just walking up and
[08:00.640 --> 08:01.640]  saying thank you.
[08:01.640 --> 08:02.640]  What the hell do you do?
[08:02.640 --> 08:04.440]  And I was like, ah, bro, I've got a podcast.
[08:04.440 --> 08:05.440]  I teach people how to grow.
[08:05.440 --> 08:07.520]  And they're like, man, that is really cool.
[08:07.520 --> 08:12.920]  A lot of people stood in line to come shake my hand and say thank you for doing this podcast.
[08:12.920 --> 08:14.240]  That meant a lot to me.
[08:14.240 --> 08:18.240]  That meant as much as all of the seed business meant to me all weekend long.
[08:18.240 --> 08:19.240]  So thank you.
[08:19.240 --> 08:22.480]  If you stopped and said hello, if you shook my hand and said thank you for the podcast,
[08:22.480 --> 08:25.800]  if you stopped by and said hi at all, that means the world to me.
[08:25.800 --> 08:27.600]  Thank you for all of the support.
[08:27.600 --> 08:30.720]  You guys, I also met a lot of other great breeders there.
[08:30.720 --> 08:32.680]  A lot of great breeders stopped and said hi.
[08:32.680 --> 08:35.720]  Breeders I've been, like I said, talking to, interacting with.
[08:35.720 --> 08:39.480]  I finally got to meet all of those breeders that I've been talking to online and wondered
[08:39.480 --> 08:41.240]  what they look like.
[08:41.240 --> 08:44.200]  Something I really enjoyed and something that my friends at my booth were making fun of
[08:44.200 --> 08:49.160]  me for is every dreadlock person at the Indo Expo stopped at my booth and said, what's
[08:49.160 --> 08:50.160]  up?
[08:50.160 --> 08:53.960]  They either came straight to my booth or they'd be walking by and they would see either me
[08:53.960 --> 08:58.640]  with dreads or they'd see my iRegenetics flag, which is the Colorado flag, been turned red,
[08:58.640 --> 08:59.640]  yellow, and green.
[08:59.640 --> 09:03.240]  They would see either me or that flag and something in them would just bring them right
[09:03.240 --> 09:05.720]  to my booth and they would want to come talk to me.
[09:05.720 --> 09:09.960]  And I really love that all the deadheads, all the Rostas, all the dreadlocks, all the
[09:09.960 --> 09:13.440]  freaks, all the weirdos, they all wanted to come say what's up to me.
[09:13.440 --> 09:16.680]  And that really means a lot that I've kind of got my own little niche community there
[09:16.680 --> 09:18.120]  in the cannabis industry.
[09:18.120 --> 09:19.240]  That really meant a lot to me.
[09:19.240 --> 09:23.720]  So big shout out, big fist bump to all the dreads, all the Rostas, all the deadheads,
[09:23.720 --> 09:27.620]  all the freaks and weirdos, all the freaky people that came to see me this weekend.
[09:27.620 --> 09:28.620]  Big fist bump.
[09:28.620 --> 09:29.620]  That means a lot to me, you guys.
[09:29.620 --> 09:30.620]  Thanks for all the support.
[09:30.620 --> 09:36.680]  Also, talking about support, I want to give a huge shout out to a few of my fellow podcasters.
[09:36.680 --> 09:39.440]  I have known the boys from the Dude Grows show for a little while.
[09:39.440 --> 09:44.280]  I've met Scotty and the Dude a few times, but I don't remember ever meeting Guru.
[09:44.280 --> 09:49.580]  And I finally got to meet Guru from the Dude Grows podcast at the Indo Expo.
[09:49.580 --> 09:50.580]  What's up, Guru?
[09:50.580 --> 09:52.560]  Thanks for taking some great pictures of the Dude and I.
[09:52.560 --> 09:53.560]  Thanks for hanging out.
[09:53.560 --> 09:54.560]  You're a really cool dude.
[09:54.560 --> 09:56.760]  I hope we have more conversations in the future.
[09:56.760 --> 09:58.840]  Also, it was good to see the Dude.
[09:58.840 --> 10:01.000]  The Dude has moved to Canada.
[10:01.000 --> 10:03.680]  So it was really great to see the Dude back here in Colorado.
[10:03.680 --> 10:08.440]  I met the Dude at a Dude Grows cup a few years ago in Denver.
[10:08.440 --> 10:12.520]  In my mind, he will always be a part of the Colorado cannabis scene.
[10:12.520 --> 10:14.800]  So it was great to see my buddy back in Colorado.
[10:14.800 --> 10:18.680]  It was great to take a few pictures and get a few selfies and get a high five from one
[10:18.680 --> 10:20.120]  of my podcasting buddies.
[10:20.120 --> 10:21.640]  So big shout out to the Dude.
[10:21.640 --> 10:22.640]  Hey, Scotty Real.
[10:22.640 --> 10:24.840]  I didn't see you at the Indo Expo, bro.
[10:24.840 --> 10:25.840]  Where were you?
[10:25.840 --> 10:27.920]  Hope to catch up with you next time, Scotty.
[10:27.920 --> 10:31.000]  And if you guys aren't listening to the Dude Grows podcast, make sure you go give them
[10:31.000 --> 10:32.200]  a subscription.
[10:32.200 --> 10:33.240]  Great cannabis podcast.
[10:33.240 --> 10:34.640]  I think you will enjoy the show.
[10:34.640 --> 10:38.160]  If you like my show, you should definitely like the Dude Grows podcast.
[10:38.160 --> 10:43.960]  Also, I want to give a huge shout out to Shango Los from the Shaping Fire podcast.
[10:43.960 --> 10:48.440]  Several episodes back, I gave Shango Los and his podcast a huge shout out.
[10:48.440 --> 10:53.480]  Shango was gracious enough to find me at the Indo Expo and approach my booth and shake
[10:53.480 --> 10:58.680]  my hand and personally thank me for shouting out his podcast on my show.
[10:58.680 --> 11:03.600]  He told me that he saw a measurable amount of new subscribers because of my shout out.
[11:03.600 --> 11:07.240]  And I think it was really respectful that he walked up and shook my hand and thanked
[11:07.240 --> 11:08.520]  me personally.
[11:08.520 --> 11:12.920]  So if you're not listening to the Shaping Fire podcast yet, I recommend that show also.
[11:12.920 --> 11:15.880]  I think you can learn a lot and I think you will really enjoy the show.
[11:15.880 --> 11:20.200]  So once again, big shout out to the boys from the Dude Grows show and also a big shout out
[11:20.200 --> 11:23.680]  to Shango Los from the Shaping Fire podcast.
[11:23.680 --> 11:28.520]  Now I'm trying not to get too specific with shout outs because I met and interacted with
[11:28.520 --> 11:32.600]  so many people this weekend that I know I will end up leaving somebody out if I tried
[11:32.600 --> 11:33.960]  to list everybody.
[11:33.960 --> 11:36.080]  So I'm just going to get to a few people.
[11:36.080 --> 11:40.960]  Since I'm talking about fellow podcasters, let's talk about our friends from P&L Grow
[11:40.960 --> 11:41.960]  Systems.
[11:41.960 --> 11:42.960]  That's right.
[11:42.960 --> 11:46.640]  My friends, P and Lee, have been supporting the podcast for a long time.
[11:46.640 --> 11:51.120]  I have been supporting P&L Grow Systems for a very long time.
[11:51.120 --> 11:55.440]  Their business is based out of London, UK, and they made it all the way to Denver for
[11:55.440 --> 12:00.000]  the Indo Expo to come be a part of the Denver cannabis community.
[12:00.000 --> 12:05.800]  It was a great honor to finally shake hands with my friends, Peter and Lee from P&L Grow
[12:05.800 --> 12:06.800]  Systems.
[12:06.800 --> 12:08.240]  It's been an honor to work with them.
[12:08.240 --> 12:10.000]  We've done a lot of great promotions.
[12:10.000 --> 12:11.560]  I've worked with their equipment.
[12:11.560 --> 12:12.560]  They've given me some equipment.
[12:12.560 --> 12:17.840]  In fact, in a future episode, I've got a minder unit to give away to a podcast listener.
[12:17.840 --> 12:19.680]  So stay tuned for details on that.
[12:19.680 --> 12:23.760]  But it was great to finally meet my friends that we have supported each other for a long
[12:23.760 --> 12:28.440]  time and they actually told me that they would not have made it this far in their company.
[12:28.440 --> 12:32.360]  They certainly would not have made it to the Indo Expo if it were not for the support
[12:32.360 --> 12:36.560]  of myself and the Grow From Your Heart podcast, which means the support from you folks that
[12:36.560 --> 12:37.560]  listen to the show.
[12:37.560 --> 12:42.000]  So it was great to finally shake hands and get a hug and take a picture with my friends,
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.040]  P and Lee from P&L Grow Systems.
[12:44.040 --> 12:45.040]  What's up guys?
[12:45.040 --> 12:46.040]  I hope you're listening to this.
[12:46.040 --> 12:47.040]  Big shout out.
[12:47.040 --> 12:48.600]  I hope you make it back over here soon.
[12:48.600 --> 12:49.600]  I hope we get to hang out.
[12:49.600 --> 12:52.760]  I hope we get to spend more time together.
[12:52.760 --> 12:56.560]  You guys, that is a great way to segue into my next part of this podcast.
[12:56.560 --> 12:58.360]  I want to talk about the Indo Expo.
[12:58.400 --> 13:02.440]  I didn't get to see much of the Indo Expo because I was at my booth the entire time.
[13:02.440 --> 13:03.800]  I've mentioned that before.
[13:03.800 --> 13:07.480]  I spent the entire day at my booth interacting with consumers.
[13:07.480 --> 13:08.480]  It was a great time.
[13:08.480 --> 13:10.360]  I got to teach a lot about cannabis.
[13:10.360 --> 13:13.120]  I got to teach everybody about iRegenetics.
[13:13.120 --> 13:15.440]  I had a great debate about Femini seeds.
[13:15.440 --> 13:17.840]  I got to meet a lot of great breeders.
[13:17.840 --> 13:21.840]  I shared a booth with Always Be Flowering, with Medtree Seeds.
[13:21.840 --> 13:25.440]  There were several other experienced and great breeders that passed through our booth and
[13:25.440 --> 13:26.440]  came and said hi.
[13:26.440 --> 13:30.720]  That led to a lot of great conversation and a lot of great introductions.
[13:30.720 --> 13:31.720]  That was a great time.
[13:31.720 --> 13:35.480]  However, I wish I would have gotten to see a little bit of the Expo.
[13:35.480 --> 13:36.880]  I did see a little bit.
[13:36.880 --> 13:41.160]  From what I saw, there were a lot of seed vendors and seed breeders.
[13:41.160 --> 13:42.880]  From what I was told, there were over 20.
[13:42.880 --> 13:47.280]  I think we counted at least 23 seed sellers at the Expo.
[13:47.280 --> 13:49.320]  I know that Exotic Genetics was there.
[13:49.320 --> 13:50.920]  I know Capulator was there.
[13:50.920 --> 13:54.960]  Our booth was right down the row from Brothers Grimm, who was Mr. Soul.
[13:54.960 --> 13:57.080]  Ethos Genetics had a giant booth.
[13:57.080 --> 14:00.640]  There were a lot of seed sellers and vendors there.
[14:00.640 --> 14:04.720]  Another thing that was really popular at the Indoexpo was LED lighting.
[14:04.720 --> 14:09.480]  Another thing I saw a whole bunch of was auto trimming machines, which I'm not a fan of,
[14:09.480 --> 14:10.480]  but they were there.
[14:10.480 --> 14:11.760]  I'm just telling you what I saw.
[14:11.760 --> 14:13.880]  A lot of auto trimming machines.
[14:13.880 --> 14:16.860]  Also a lot of extraction equipment.
[14:16.860 --> 14:22.580]  Something that was really huge this year at Indoexpo was hemp seed and CBD.
[14:22.580 --> 14:26.540]  Many of the people that approached my booth on the first day were from out of state and
[14:26.540 --> 14:31.620]  they were looking for bulk hemp seed that they could take home and start farming hemp.
[14:31.620 --> 14:34.580]  The other thing that was huge was CBD.
[14:34.580 --> 14:38.580]  Last year, there was an area known as the Hemp Hallway, and that hallway had all of
[14:38.580 --> 14:40.020]  the hemp vendors.
[14:40.020 --> 14:43.300]  This year, there was the Hemp and CBD Pavilion.
[14:43.300 --> 14:49.680]  A large portion of the Indoexpo Center was dedicated just to hemp and CBD products.
[14:49.680 --> 14:52.500]  You could find anything with CBD in this area.
[14:52.500 --> 14:55.020]  There were dog treats with CBD in it.
[14:55.020 --> 14:59.120]  I tasted some amazing maple syrup that had CBD in it.
[14:59.120 --> 15:00.880]  There was CBD ice cream.
[15:00.880 --> 15:03.120]  There were CBD salves and rubs.
[15:03.120 --> 15:06.740]  There were CBD concentrates available in that area.
[15:06.740 --> 15:12.220]  Anything you could imagine to put CBD into was available in that Hemp and CBD Pavilion
[15:12.340 --> 15:14.860]  at the Indoexpo this year.
[15:14.860 --> 15:19.340]  Even though I didn't get to see a large portion of the Indoexpo, I still had the time of my
[15:19.340 --> 15:20.340]  life.
[15:20.340 --> 15:21.620]  This was my favorite Indoexpo.
[15:21.620 --> 15:23.900]  I honestly thought it was going to be stressful.
[15:23.900 --> 15:27.580]  I thought that running the booth may give me a little bit of anxiety, but honestly,
[15:27.580 --> 15:29.060]  it went super smoothly.
[15:29.060 --> 15:30.100]  It went without a hitch.
[15:30.100 --> 15:34.020]  I couldn't have asked for a better time, and I honestly had the time of my life.
[15:34.020 --> 15:38.000]  I want to give a huge shout out once again to everybody that came and said hello, everybody
[15:38.000 --> 15:39.460]  that high-fived me.
[15:39.460 --> 15:42.580]  Even if you just kind of walked by the booth and you just gave me that little head nod
[15:42.580 --> 15:46.220]  that people do or the big eyes, or maybe you threw up a peace sign, or maybe you did a
[15:46.220 --> 15:50.260]  little fist bump across the way, if you said what's up to me at Indoexpo, what's up?
[15:50.260 --> 15:51.260]  Thanks for the love and support.
[15:51.260 --> 15:54.820]  If you came to the booth and shook my hand, if you walked away with some gifts, or if
[15:54.820 --> 15:56.780]  you walked away with a shirt, big up.
[15:56.780 --> 15:57.780]  Thanks for all the support.
[15:57.780 --> 15:58.780]  I appreciate it.
[15:58.780 --> 16:01.860]  If you came and said hello, if you came and said thank you, I appreciate all of that.
[16:01.860 --> 16:03.580]  It meant the world to me.
[16:03.580 --> 16:07.900]  I still have a big silly smile on my face from all of the fun I had at the Indoexpo,
[16:07.900 --> 16:09.420]  and I can't wait for next year.
[16:09.420 --> 16:12.220]  All right, you guys, that is my Indoexpo wrap-up.
[16:12.220 --> 16:14.420]  I know this was a short, sweet podcast.
[16:14.420 --> 16:15.420]  This was a Thursday episode.
[16:15.420 --> 16:18.340]  I hope you had fun hearing about the Indoexpo.
[16:18.340 --> 16:20.660]  I'll be back Monday with another episode.
[16:20.660 --> 16:25.940]  Most likely, I am going to repost the trimming episode as the next Grow Lesson, which will
[16:25.940 --> 16:30.660]  be followed by the drying and curing episode, which will most likely be followed by the
[16:30.660 --> 16:36.900]  clean up and restart episode, which will conclude my long series of Grow Lessons.
[16:36.900 --> 16:39.900]  At that point, I will start putting out brand new content.
[16:39.900 --> 16:43.220]  If you've got questions, if you've got some emails, now is a good time to start sending
[16:43.220 --> 16:44.220]  those in.
[16:44.220 --> 16:46.500]  I will start getting them lined up for the new episodes.
[16:46.500 --> 16:49.700]  I want to thank you guys for listening to the long series of Grow Lessons.
[16:49.700 --> 16:52.380]  I also want to thank you for listening to this episode.
[16:52.380 --> 16:54.380]  I look forward to joining you on Monday.
