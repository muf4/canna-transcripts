[00:00.120 --> 00:01.880]  All right, here we go.
[00:01.880 --> 00:02.880]  Take 27.
[00:02.880 --> 00:03.880]  Maybe it's 28.
[00:03.880 --> 00:05.000]  Could be take 30.
[00:05.000 --> 00:08.360]  I've honestly lost count of takes at this time.
[00:08.360 --> 00:09.520]  We're gonna get it right this time.
[00:09.520 --> 00:10.520]  Here we go.
[00:10.520 --> 00:11.520]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:11.520 --> 00:12.520]  I am your host.
[00:12.520 --> 00:13.520]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:13.520 --> 00:18.160]  This is episode 621 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:18.160 --> 00:19.400]  This may be a short episode.
[00:19.400 --> 00:23.520]  This is definitely not your regularly scheduled program.
[00:23.520 --> 00:27.040]  This is a very special episode dedicated to a very special person.
[00:27.040 --> 00:29.880]  It is not the show I wanted to deliver to you.
[00:29.920 --> 00:32.240]  It is not the show I wanted to record today.
[00:32.240 --> 00:36.320]  But this is the show that my friend Stoney Scholar deserves.
[00:36.320 --> 00:37.560]  I'm gonna try to keep it together.
[00:37.560 --> 00:38.800]  I may get emotional.
[00:38.800 --> 00:40.280]  I may have to take a couple of breaks.
[00:40.280 --> 00:44.440]  There may be some weird edits, but we're gonna get through this together.
[00:44.440 --> 00:49.880]  A couple of nights ago, my friend Stoney Scholar, a very integral member of the Ivory Army,
[00:49.880 --> 00:54.720]  a very huge member of the cannabis community, a very important part of the world, was hit
[00:54.720 --> 00:58.040]  and killed by a drunk driver.
[00:58.200 --> 01:00.040]  I've got a lot of mixed emotions about that.
[01:00.040 --> 01:01.640]  The first one is, fuck, my friend is dead.
[01:01.640 --> 01:03.840]  I've got sadness and sorrow.
[01:03.840 --> 01:06.960]  Then I've got a lot of mixed emotions toward the person who killed my friend.
[01:06.960 --> 01:08.240]  It's not my spot to judge.
[01:08.240 --> 01:10.160]  It's not my spot to deal with that.
[01:10.160 --> 01:13.760]  But holy shit, my friend is dead and it's somebody else's fault.
[01:13.760 --> 01:15.320]  So that sucks.
[01:15.320 --> 01:18.960]  That person, I'm not gonna cast any judgment or hate on that person.
[01:18.960 --> 01:21.800]  They've got to deal with the fact that they took out my friend.
[01:21.800 --> 01:24.120]  They got to deal with that for the rest of their living life.
[01:24.120 --> 01:27.360]  But man, fuck you for killing my friend is how I honestly feel.
[01:27.360 --> 01:28.360]  It hurts.
[01:28.360 --> 01:29.360]  It sucks.
[01:29.360 --> 01:30.360]  Somebody's gone.
[01:30.360 --> 01:31.360]  My friend is gone.
[01:31.360 --> 01:33.000]  Somebody's husband is gone.
[01:33.000 --> 01:35.240]  A bunch of pets, daddy is gone.
[01:35.240 --> 01:38.240]  And that shit sucks, dude.
[01:38.240 --> 01:39.640]  We're not gonna bitch and complain on the show.
[01:39.640 --> 01:41.600]  That's what it feels like I've started off doing.
[01:41.600 --> 01:43.800]  A lot of emotions going on.
[01:43.800 --> 01:49.040]  Let's turn this into a special shout out and a tribute to my friend Stoney Scholar.
[01:49.040 --> 01:51.840]  I discovered Stoney on the Embracing Organics podcast.
[01:51.840 --> 01:53.600]  Shout out to the whole EO crew.
[01:53.600 --> 01:56.840]  I hope you guys watch the EO podcast that we talk about Stoney.
[01:57.320 --> 01:59.120]  I'm sure we're gonna talk about him the whole episode.
[01:59.120 --> 02:00.920]  So check that one.
[02:00.920 --> 02:04.760]  But I met Stoney, discovered Stoney Scholar through the Embracing Organics podcast.
[02:04.760 --> 02:06.160]  He was EO crew.
[02:06.160 --> 02:07.160]  He was DGC.
[02:07.160 --> 02:08.820]  That is Dude Grows Crew.
[02:08.820 --> 02:11.040]  He was also Irie Army before he knew it.
[02:11.040 --> 02:13.960]  He just had to find us and discover us and become part of the crew.
[02:13.960 --> 02:15.640]  He quickly became Irie Army.
[02:15.640 --> 02:16.960]  He was a good dude.
[02:16.960 --> 02:19.760]  He was a fellow grower.
[02:19.760 --> 02:20.760]  He was Irie Army.
[02:20.760 --> 02:22.040]  He was DGC.
[02:22.040 --> 02:23.200]  He was a husband.
[02:23.200 --> 02:24.520]  He was a pet dad.
[02:24.520 --> 02:25.520]  He was a good friend.
[02:25.520 --> 02:26.520]  He was my fucking friend.
[02:27.200 --> 02:28.480]  He was a cool, funny dude.
[02:28.480 --> 02:33.440]  He was cantankerous and ornery.
[02:33.440 --> 02:34.440]  He liked to push you.
[02:34.440 --> 02:36.200]  And he was a little bit provocative.
[02:36.200 --> 02:38.040]  Those are my favorite kind of fucking people.
[02:38.040 --> 02:42.360]  He was cantankerous is one of the words I like to use for him.
[02:42.360 --> 02:43.360]  Those are great people.
[02:43.360 --> 02:44.640]  I always had a good time talking to him.
[02:44.640 --> 02:47.040]  I did troll him a little bit.
[02:47.040 --> 02:48.720]  But that was the relationship that we had.
[02:48.720 --> 02:49.720]  We trolled each other.
[02:49.720 --> 02:50.720]  We poked each other.
[02:50.720 --> 02:51.720]  I gave him a hard time.
[02:51.720 --> 02:52.920]  He gave me a hard time.
[02:52.920 --> 02:54.240]  It was to encourage each other.
[02:54.240 --> 02:57.600]  When I'm trolling you and poking you, it's a gentle way of showing you that there is
[02:57.600 --> 02:58.600]  a better way.
[02:58.600 --> 03:00.160]  I'm encouraging you.
[03:00.160 --> 03:01.320]  We're just enlightening each other.
[03:01.320 --> 03:02.960]  It's how bros and guys do it.
[03:02.960 --> 03:04.760]  I'll do it to the ladies too.
[03:04.760 --> 03:07.400]  But we had kind of a trolly relationship with each other.
[03:07.400 --> 03:08.400]  And it was fun.
[03:08.400 --> 03:12.700]  I just hope he knows that I had nothing but love and respect and that our friendly bickering
[03:12.700 --> 03:18.360]  was nothing but two old guys friendly arguing bickering as two old guys.
[03:18.360 --> 03:21.320]  So Stoney, I hope you always took me with a grain of salt.
[03:21.320 --> 03:24.200]  I hope you always knew I was giving you my bullshit with tongue in cheek.
[03:25.160 --> 03:26.440]  I had nothing but love.
[03:26.440 --> 03:30.720]  Still got nothing but love and respect for Stoney Scholar.
[03:30.720 --> 03:34.520]  I think I'm still in shock and pissed off and angry that he's gone.
[03:34.520 --> 03:36.680]  But doing this podcast is helping me.
[03:36.680 --> 03:38.720]  And my boy deserves this.
[03:38.720 --> 03:41.320]  Stoney was a generous fucking dude.
[03:41.320 --> 03:44.960]  Actually this pipe I've been smoking out of on recent live shows and recent episodes was
[03:44.960 --> 03:46.740]  a gift to my buddy Stoney.
[03:46.740 --> 03:48.120]  So I told you how I discovered him.
[03:48.120 --> 03:51.720]  Let me tell you how I actually met Stoney Scholar in person.
[03:51.720 --> 03:54.320]  The Dude Grows Concentration Celebration.
[03:54.320 --> 03:55.320]  I think it was that event.
[03:55.320 --> 03:56.320]  There are so many events.
[03:56.320 --> 03:57.320]  Don't remember the name.
[03:57.320 --> 03:58.320]  Don't remember which one it was.
[03:58.320 --> 04:03.360]  It was the Dude Grows event at the, what was the place used to be called?
[04:03.360 --> 04:04.360]  Cultivated Synergy.
[04:04.360 --> 04:05.360]  Was that what it was?
[04:05.360 --> 04:06.720]  Cultivated Synergy up there in Denver.
[04:06.720 --> 04:07.720]  Really cool place.
[04:07.720 --> 04:11.040]  The Dude Grows would throw parties there, events there.
[04:11.040 --> 04:13.680]  The Stoney Scholar came there and actually hung out.
[04:13.680 --> 04:15.680]  He came with Stabby.
[04:15.680 --> 04:18.480]  He came with the whole EO crew and met me, hung out at my booth.
[04:18.480 --> 04:22.720]  He actually stored his backpack behind the iRegenetics booth the whole night because
[04:22.720 --> 04:25.000]  he had so much shit with him because he was on the road.
[04:25.000 --> 04:27.920]  He brought me this pipe, gave me this pipe as a gift.
[04:27.920 --> 04:31.400]  If you wanted to smoke some of his concentrates, he'd hand you the jar, say take as big of
[04:31.400 --> 04:32.960]  a fucking dab you want.
[04:32.960 --> 04:36.200]  If you wanted to smoke his flower, he'd say pick the bud you want to smoke.
[04:36.200 --> 04:38.560]  Dude was super generous, super kind.
[04:38.560 --> 04:40.200]  We had funny laughs.
[04:40.200 --> 04:45.040]  We had, we were grouchy old men together that laughed at grouchy old men shit and I loved
[04:45.040 --> 04:46.040]  it.
[04:46.040 --> 04:47.040]  It felt good.
[04:47.040 --> 04:48.040]  It was fun.
[04:48.600 --> 04:51.640]  I'm telling you guys, this is therapy for me and I owe this to my friend Stoney.
[04:51.640 --> 04:54.760]  So I'm going to hit this bowl, think about my buddy Stoney, then we'll continue in a
[04:54.760 --> 04:55.760]  moment here.
[04:55.760 --> 05:00.160]  I just wanted to make sure that we'd give him a shout out for being a generous dude,
[05:00.160 --> 05:03.480]  being a cantankerous dude, always an honest dude.
[05:03.480 --> 05:06.040]  He never, to me, he never seemed dishonest.
[05:06.040 --> 05:09.320]  He was too cantankerous and ornery to tell a lie.
[05:09.320 --> 05:13.400]  He'd rather tell you the dirty truth with his tongue in his cheek and look at you sideways
[05:13.400 --> 05:16.200]  and be like, actually, you look like a fucking idiot in that shirt.
[05:16.200 --> 05:18.840]  He would never tell you you look good in something he didn't look good in.
[05:18.840 --> 05:21.400]  That was his style and I appreciate that in people.
[05:21.400 --> 05:23.520]  That's the kind of friends I like to have around.
[05:23.520 --> 05:25.780]  I'm going to hit a bowl, take a very brief moment.
[05:25.780 --> 05:26.780]  It's a podcast.
[05:26.780 --> 05:29.280]  I can't do a fucking hour of silence for my boy.
[05:29.280 --> 05:31.320]  We're going to hit a bowl, have a brief moment.
[05:31.320 --> 05:32.320]  Think about your friends.
[05:32.320 --> 05:35.440]  Think about the people that are around you, the people you don't see often enough, the
[05:35.440 --> 05:37.080]  people you see too often.
[05:37.080 --> 05:40.040]  Think about the folks you love, the people you're going to miss when they're not around.
[05:40.040 --> 05:42.000]  I'm going to think about my buddy Stoney Scholar.
[05:42.000 --> 05:44.480]  If you knew Stoney, think about him while I hit this bowl.
[05:44.480 --> 05:45.480]  He hit a bowl with me.
[05:45.480 --> 05:48.640]  If you didn't know him, send a vibe up to him or think about the people that you miss
[05:48.640 --> 05:50.680]  or that you don't want to miss.
[05:50.680 --> 05:53.960]  Let's celebrate Stoney Scholar with a puff off of this bowl together.
[05:53.960 --> 05:55.440]  I'm going to quit rambling.
[05:55.440 --> 05:57.880]  Moment of silence and a rip for my buddy Stoney Scholar.
[05:57.880 --> 05:59.000]  Let's do it together, you guys.
[05:59.000 --> 06:13.580]  Cheers, Stoney Scholar.
[06:13.580 --> 06:17.180]  I'll never forget that Stoney Scholar showed up to the event with a fucking e-mail and
[06:17.180 --> 06:18.980]  a rig ready to go.
[06:18.980 --> 06:21.340]  Plugged it into my booth and just started taking dabs at my booth.
[06:21.340 --> 06:24.020]  I was like, this is like my workspace, bro.
[06:24.020 --> 06:25.020]  We're going to have to make some room.
[06:25.020 --> 06:27.380]  He's like, sure, I'll just put it behind your booth.
[06:27.380 --> 06:29.740]  Everybody ended up behind my booth, dabbing and having a good time.
[06:29.740 --> 06:31.460]  It was a great little home base.
[06:31.460 --> 06:34.500]  It was a really good time hanging out with Stoney Scholar.
[06:34.500 --> 06:36.580]  It's bullshit that I'm never going to get to do that again.
[06:36.580 --> 06:38.740]  I want to give him compliments and praises.
[06:38.740 --> 06:39.740]  He was a good dude.
[06:39.740 --> 06:41.300]  He's a good grower.
[06:41.300 --> 06:44.060]  We gave each other a lot of shit, but it was to drive each other.
[06:44.060 --> 06:47.780]  I come on here and I seem like I am the cannabis guru.
[06:47.780 --> 06:48.780]  I'm the one teaching.
[06:48.780 --> 06:53.100]  I'm the one spreading the knowledge and sharing things with everybody.
[06:53.100 --> 06:54.180]  Stoney taught me a lot.
[06:54.340 --> 06:55.340]  Don't get it twisted.
[06:55.340 --> 06:57.220]  I learned a lot from everybody.
[06:57.220 --> 06:59.060]  Stoney never failed to teach me something.
[06:59.060 --> 07:00.060]  He had new ideas.
[07:00.060 --> 07:01.060]  He was innovative.
[07:01.060 --> 07:03.900]  He had completely different thought processes.
[07:03.900 --> 07:07.780]  We think in a completely different way, which I enjoy and respect.
[07:07.780 --> 07:09.620]  Those are the kind of friends I like to be surrounded by.
[07:09.620 --> 07:13.460]  I don't need a bunch of friends that all love reggae and fish and all want to grow weed
[07:13.460 --> 07:17.060]  and do all the same exact shit, or we end up doing the same exact shit.
[07:17.060 --> 07:19.580]  I love that he was different than me, that he was a good dude.
[07:19.580 --> 07:25.900]  So I think if I just keep going, I'm rambling and this will get emotional and all of that
[07:25.900 --> 07:26.900]  stuff.
[07:26.900 --> 07:31.580]  So there's nothing left to do but take a big fat dab and just give a big fist bump.
[07:31.580 --> 07:34.540]  This right here, fist bump, Stoney Scholar, that's for you, bro.
[07:34.540 --> 07:36.780]  I wanted to come on here and make sure to show you some love.
[07:36.780 --> 07:38.420]  You deserved a full episode.
[07:38.420 --> 07:39.900]  It's a short one, you guys.
[07:39.900 --> 07:44.180]  I'm in no condition to record a long podcast about growing weed.
[07:44.180 --> 07:45.460]  I'll be back in a couple of days.
[07:45.460 --> 07:46.940]  You know how I do it.
[07:46.940 --> 07:49.460]  Thank you for joining me for this episode.
[07:49.460 --> 07:52.140]  Thank you for paying tribute to my buddy, Stoney Scholar.
[07:52.140 --> 07:54.500]  Thank you for supporting the podcast and for being my friend.
[07:54.500 --> 07:58.060]  I got a lot of people sending me shout outs saying, hey, I heard we lost a friend.
[07:58.060 --> 07:59.060]  Yes, we did.
[07:59.060 --> 08:00.060]  I am okay.
[08:00.060 --> 08:01.060]  It hurts.
[08:01.060 --> 08:02.140]  It sucks.
[08:02.140 --> 08:04.740]  Like I said before, I'm mad that my friend is gone.
[08:04.740 --> 08:08.540]  I'm mad that I don't get to troll him, talk shit to him, get his advice, give him advice,
[08:08.540 --> 08:09.940]  have that dude around.
[08:09.940 --> 08:14.700]  I'm angry that somebody recklessly and irresponsibly killed my friend.
[08:14.700 --> 08:15.700]  That's complete bullshit.
[08:16.020 --> 08:20.500]  It is not my place to judge or punish that person, so I'm going to do my best to forgive
[08:20.500 --> 08:21.500]  them in my heart.
[08:21.500 --> 08:25.300]  That will take some time, to be honest with you.
[08:25.300 --> 08:31.580]  I don't know exactly how to let go of the feeling of you killed my friend, so fuck you.
[08:31.580 --> 08:33.020]  But that will come.
[08:33.020 --> 08:34.020]  I'm getting older.
[08:34.020 --> 08:35.020]  I'm learning a lot.
[08:35.020 --> 08:37.300]  But I'm going to deal with it the best I can.
[08:37.300 --> 08:42.380]  We've got a big crew that does support each other, but we're going to need some love and
[08:42.380 --> 08:43.380]  support.
[08:43.380 --> 08:47.620]  The entire Embracing Organics family lost a huge team member.
[08:47.620 --> 08:50.940]  Stoney was working on some projects that lost a huge team member.
[08:50.940 --> 08:52.500]  So I am okay.
[08:52.500 --> 08:53.500]  I'm going to be okay.
[08:53.500 --> 08:55.660]  Let's send those love and hugs to the EO crew.
[08:55.660 --> 08:57.340]  Shout out to my friends at EO.
[08:57.340 --> 09:00.500]  I started off on that podcast just being a panel.
[09:00.500 --> 09:01.500]  I was a guest.
[09:01.500 --> 09:04.980]  They invited me to be a guest, and then they said, hey, dude, you are now a panel member.
[09:04.980 --> 09:06.180]  You can hang out anytime.
[09:06.180 --> 09:08.760]  Honestly, now it's the EO family.
[09:08.760 --> 09:10.220]  We check on each other.
[09:10.220 --> 09:11.340]  We send each other messages.
[09:11.340 --> 09:13.420]  We're always saying what's up, making sure everybody's okay.
[09:13.420 --> 09:16.620]  I get funny messages from some of those guys in the morning.
[09:16.620 --> 09:18.700]  Stabby will message me at fucking three in the morning.
[09:18.700 --> 09:21.140]  Dirtmandan hits me up around five.
[09:21.140 --> 09:23.540]  Everybody's in different time zones, so it's really fun.
[09:23.540 --> 09:26.460]  Dave and I talk a lot more than you guys would imagine.
[09:26.460 --> 09:29.460]  So we've become the Embracing Organics family.
[09:29.460 --> 09:33.740]  And yes, sometimes there are riffs in the force and groups have bickering and whatnot.
[09:33.740 --> 09:37.420]  But hopefully something like this will show a lot of the younger kids that we've got to
[09:37.420 --> 09:38.420]  put the bullshit away.
[09:38.420 --> 09:39.420]  We've got to be friends.
[09:39.420 --> 09:40.420]  We've got to love one another.
[09:40.500 --> 09:43.180]  We've got to respect each other, not just in each group, but in the community and the
[09:43.180 --> 09:45.980]  world overall.
[09:45.980 --> 09:46.980]  That's a good way to wrap this up.
[09:46.980 --> 09:50.740]  You guys love the people you could love, love the people that are around you.
[09:50.740 --> 09:52.380]  They may not be there forever.
[09:52.380 --> 09:54.180]  I know we're focused on the gardens.
[09:54.180 --> 09:55.340]  We're focused on business.
[09:55.340 --> 09:56.600]  We're focused on moving forward.
[09:56.600 --> 09:57.600]  It's quarantine.
[09:57.600 --> 09:58.600]  It's COVID time.
[09:58.600 --> 10:00.200]  Who knows what we're focused on right now.
[10:00.200 --> 10:02.940]  Let's not forget to focus on love and friendship.
[10:02.940 --> 10:05.300]  Take a minute to thank your friends for being your friends.
[10:05.300 --> 10:08.660]  Take a minute to enjoy your friends while they're your friends.
[10:08.660 --> 10:13.500]  The old ones, the young ones, in these weird times, anybody can go away at any time.
[10:13.500 --> 10:14.500]  It could be a drunk driver.
[10:14.500 --> 10:15.500]  It could be COVID.
[10:15.500 --> 10:17.020]  It could be heart disease.
[10:17.020 --> 10:19.740]  It could be so many things in this world that could take you out.
[10:19.740 --> 10:21.180]  Let's appreciate the people that are around.
[10:21.180 --> 10:22.900]  Let's spend some time with those people.
[10:22.900 --> 10:27.420]  Put down the iPhones, put down the iPads, spend some eye-to-eye contact with the people
[10:27.420 --> 10:28.420]  that we love.
[10:28.420 --> 10:29.420]  I'm going to heat up a dab nail.
[10:29.420 --> 10:33.060]  I'm going to take a fat dab in honor of my buddy, Stoney Scholar.
[10:33.060 --> 10:36.460]  I think I'm just going to let the credits roll by or something like that while I take
[10:36.460 --> 10:37.460]  this dab.
[10:37.460 --> 10:39.060]  I'm going to play some music or something.
[10:39.060 --> 10:43.100]  I don't want to make the video too long and redundant and obnoxious.
[10:43.100 --> 10:47.100]  Once again, I want to send a giant shout out to my buddy, Stoney Scholar.
[10:47.100 --> 10:48.100]  Stay tuned.
[10:48.100 --> 10:53.340]  He did leave behind a wife who is now ... She does not have a husband who I can only imagine
[10:53.340 --> 10:55.980]  what it would be like to lose your partner in life.
[10:55.980 --> 10:56.980]  Part of the income is gone.
[10:56.980 --> 10:57.980]  It's not just the income.
[10:57.980 --> 11:00.060]  It's the stability, the emotional support.
[11:00.060 --> 11:03.320]  That person's been there next to you every waking hour.
[11:03.320 --> 11:05.180]  That's going to be a huge adjustment.
[11:05.180 --> 11:10.260]  I am sure that there will be some sort of fundraising for Mrs. Stoney Scholar.
[11:10.260 --> 11:15.140]  We need to keep her on her feet emotionally, physically, financially.
[11:15.140 --> 11:19.340]  We need to make sure that there's rent paid, some food in the refrigerator, and that she's
[11:19.340 --> 11:23.540]  got the best smile that she could possibly get while her husband is gone and she's adjusting
[11:23.540 --> 11:24.540]  to this.
[11:24.540 --> 11:25.540]  There may be funeral costs.
[11:25.540 --> 11:30.220]  As soon as I do know those details, I'll either post them in the show notes video description
[11:30.220 --> 11:32.980]  or I will share them on social media.
[11:32.980 --> 11:35.220]  I'm going to ask you guys to help my friend Stoney.
[11:35.220 --> 11:39.220]  Trust me, I will make a generous contribution to help out Stoney Scholar as well.
[11:39.220 --> 11:41.260]  We got to take care of the family, take care of the army.
[11:41.260 --> 11:42.260]  All right, you guys.
[11:42.260 --> 11:43.580]  This dab nail is quite hot.
[11:43.580 --> 11:45.260]  There's no need for me to continue.
[11:45.260 --> 11:47.300]  I want to thank you guys for listening to this.
[11:47.300 --> 11:49.700]  Once again, shout out Stoney Scholar.
[11:49.700 --> 11:50.700]  I'm going to miss you.
[11:50.700 --> 11:51.700]  Miss talking shit to you.
[11:51.700 --> 11:53.900]  Miss getting shit talked back to me.
[11:53.900 --> 11:55.380]  Fist bump, big hug.
[11:55.380 --> 11:56.780]  I'll see you one day, bro.
[11:56.780 --> 11:59.980]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
