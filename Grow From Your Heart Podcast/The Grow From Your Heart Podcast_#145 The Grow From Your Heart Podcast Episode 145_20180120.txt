[00:16.890 --> 00:19.250]  Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis community.
[00:19.250 --> 00:20.850]  It's time for episode number 145
[00:20.850 --> 00:22.530]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:22.530 --> 00:26.370]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:26.370 --> 00:27.290]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:27.290 --> 00:28.330]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:28.330 --> 00:30.530]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:30.530 --> 00:31.730]  if you're a cannabis activist
[00:31.730 --> 00:32.910]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:32.910 --> 00:34.370]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:34.370 --> 00:37.570]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:37.570 --> 00:39.330]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:39.330 --> 00:41.110]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:41.110 --> 00:43.210]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:43.210 --> 00:44.710]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots Band
[00:44.710 --> 00:47.030]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:47.030 --> 00:48.590]  Big shout out to Kat, Koot,
[00:48.590 --> 00:50.570]  and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:52.230 --> 00:53.390]  I hope everybody's having a great week.
[00:53.390 --> 00:55.550]  You guys, this episode is packed with information.
[00:55.550 --> 00:57.910]  I'm gonna do an episode about an email I got
[00:57.910 --> 01:00.510]  about making feminized seeds and selecting phenotypes
[01:00.510 --> 01:03.470]  for seeds and seed breeding and feminized seed making.
[01:03.470 --> 01:05.950]  This one was right up my alley, so I took a lot of notes.
[01:05.950 --> 01:08.010]  This will be a great episode, in my opinion.
[01:08.010 --> 01:09.310]  I'm excited to do it.
[01:09.310 --> 01:10.550]  But before we get that far,
[01:10.550 --> 01:12.190]  let's talk about the secret sesh, you guys.
[01:12.190 --> 01:14.410]  The secret sesh was just a few days ago.
[01:15.110 --> 01:16.970]  And in my opinion, this was the best secret sesh
[01:16.970 --> 01:18.290]  we've done in Colorado.
[01:18.290 --> 01:21.910]  You know, the secret sesh on 421, the day after 420,
[01:21.910 --> 01:23.370]  that was pretty fucking fantastic.
[01:23.370 --> 01:25.050]  But that was the day after 420.
[01:25.050 --> 01:26.850]  There were a lot of really cool people in town
[01:26.850 --> 01:28.170]  that wouldn't normally be here.
[01:28.170 --> 01:30.570]  We had a lot of extra hype because of the 420 weekend,
[01:30.570 --> 01:31.630]  a lot of extra momentum.
[01:31.630 --> 01:32.970]  That really helped us out.
[01:32.970 --> 01:35.630]  It was a little overhyped and too big for me.
[01:35.630 --> 01:38.290]  I like a smaller, more intimate event.
[01:38.290 --> 01:40.010]  So without all the hustle and bustle,
[01:40.010 --> 01:41.890]  this was my favorite secret sesh, I think.
[01:41.890 --> 01:42.850]  There were plenty of people there.
[01:42.850 --> 01:45.210]  The place was packed, but it was a little more intimate.
[01:45.210 --> 01:47.610]  There was more room to dab, more room to chill out.
[01:47.610 --> 01:48.890]  It was a little quieter.
[01:48.890 --> 01:50.250]  You could go get some quiet space
[01:50.250 --> 01:51.630]  and talk to some people if you wanted to.
[01:51.630 --> 01:53.370]  I really enjoyed that.
[01:53.370 --> 01:55.210]  So huge shout out to the Grimy Gatsby
[01:55.210 --> 01:56.770]  for throwing a stellar event.
[01:56.770 --> 01:58.650]  Big shout out to Miles for putting it together.
[01:58.650 --> 01:59.490]  Big shout out to Hunt.
[01:59.490 --> 02:01.790]  Big shout out to everybody who participated
[02:01.790 --> 02:03.370]  in the secret sesh.
[02:03.370 --> 02:05.490]  I'm gonna go down a little bit of a list here.
[02:05.490 --> 02:07.470]  The Terps from Evo Labs.
[02:07.470 --> 02:09.750]  Good shout out to, big huge shout out to my buddy Brett.
[02:09.750 --> 02:11.810]  Brett, Mary's motivation on Instagram.
[02:11.810 --> 02:12.650]  Make sure you follow him.
[02:13.450 --> 02:15.890]  Dude showed up with a pocket full of Terps.
[02:15.890 --> 02:17.010]  Somebody said something.
[02:17.010 --> 02:18.930]  My buddy Bobo said something to Brett,
[02:18.930 --> 02:20.890]  and Brett goes, so you want some Terps?
[02:20.890 --> 02:22.010]  And of course Bobo was like,
[02:22.010 --> 02:23.490]  well of course I want some Terps.
[02:23.490 --> 02:25.130]  And he threw him a canister
[02:25.130 --> 02:27.290]  filled with little Terp containers.
[02:27.290 --> 02:29.770]  And Bobo's eyes lit up like a child at Christmas.
[02:29.770 --> 02:31.490]  And I just happened to have a bunch of packs of seeds
[02:31.490 --> 02:32.930]  in my pocket that I was gonna give
[02:32.930 --> 02:34.330]  to some friends to grow out.
[02:34.330 --> 02:37.050]  And since I saw that beautiful gift given right there,
[02:37.050 --> 02:38.490]  I decided to return some karma
[02:38.490 --> 02:40.410]  and I passed some seeds Brett's way.
[02:40.450 --> 02:42.690]  So Brett's got some iReed genetic seeds in his garden.
[02:42.690 --> 02:43.970]  He'll be growing those out before too long
[02:43.970 --> 02:45.770]  and we'll talk about those on the podcast.
[02:45.770 --> 02:48.010]  So big huge shout out to the Terpy boy Brett.
[02:48.010 --> 02:49.050]  Brett hooks it up with the Terps.
[02:49.050 --> 02:50.850]  He's just got us dabbed out.
[02:50.850 --> 02:52.210]  He had some super good flavors.
[02:52.210 --> 02:54.410]  Everybody at the event had good flavor.
[02:54.410 --> 02:56.330]  Shout out to our friends at the Terp suite.
[02:56.330 --> 02:57.690]  All those kids always bring the flame.
[02:57.690 --> 02:59.530]  It was good to see Diamond Dave at the event.
[02:59.530 --> 03:00.970]  Dave, I don't know if you listen to the podcast.
[03:00.970 --> 03:01.810]  A big shout out.
[03:01.810 --> 03:02.930]  It was good to shake your hand and see you.
[03:02.930 --> 03:05.290]  Haven't seen you in a long time.
[03:05.290 --> 03:07.170]  Just seemed like we weren't getting along on Facebook
[03:07.170 --> 03:08.570]  for some reason, bro.
[03:08.570 --> 03:09.770]  And it's good to shake your hand
[03:10.130 --> 03:10.970]  and fucking put that behind us.
[03:10.970 --> 03:12.690]  So welcome back to the crew, my friend.
[03:12.690 --> 03:14.130]  Big shout out to Lindsey and Chris
[03:14.130 --> 03:16.330]  for letting me kind of tag along to be their third wheel.
[03:16.330 --> 03:18.210]  I had fun hanging out with you guys.
[03:18.210 --> 03:19.530]  We'll get Lindsey on another episode
[03:19.530 --> 03:21.730]  because I've got something I want to talk to her about.
[03:21.730 --> 03:23.170]  And then we'll talk about sending stickers
[03:23.170 --> 03:24.450]  to all you people that we owe stickers to.
[03:24.450 --> 03:25.810]  We did not forget Mike and Lindsey
[03:25.810 --> 03:27.690]  and I talked about it via text message.
[03:27.690 --> 03:29.210]  I know we owe you guys some stickers.
[03:29.210 --> 03:30.290]  Fred, your stickers are coming.
[03:30.290 --> 03:31.890]  A couple other people, you got stickers coming.
[03:31.890 --> 03:34.370]  The people that participated in the mullet challenge,
[03:34.370 --> 03:35.330]  you do have stickers coming.
[03:35.330 --> 03:36.250]  I did not forget about you.
[03:36.250 --> 03:37.970]  The people that hit up hashtag,
[03:37.970 --> 03:39.730]  I like it when you ramble, you've got stickers coming.
[03:40.570 --> 03:41.410]  Nobody forgot about you.
[03:41.410 --> 03:42.730]  We're just dabbed, we're blazing and confused.
[03:42.730 --> 03:44.290]  We're doing what we can to keep up.
[03:44.290 --> 03:46.170]  So back on track here, shout out to Adam Mill.
[03:46.170 --> 03:47.850]  Adam Mill comes all the way from California.
[03:47.850 --> 03:50.930]  He flies in from Burbank all the way to Colorado here
[03:50.930 --> 03:53.010]  to host the secret session with us.
[03:53.010 --> 03:54.530]  So big shout out to my boy, Adam Mill.
[03:54.530 --> 03:55.730]  What?
[03:55.730 --> 03:57.370]  If you don't know about Adam Mill, make sure you follow him.
[03:57.370 --> 03:58.970]  It's at Adam Blunts, I think.
[03:58.970 --> 04:00.570]  So he always has to change his social media.
[04:00.570 --> 04:01.770]  They always shut down his social media.
[04:01.770 --> 04:03.850]  He has to restart new shit.
[04:03.850 --> 04:05.090]  Search Adam Mill on Instagram.
[04:05.090 --> 04:06.650]  I think it's Adam Blunts on Facebook.
[04:06.650 --> 04:07.490]  Check him out.
[04:07.490 --> 04:09.130]  He's the hostess with the mostest.
[04:09.490 --> 04:10.490]  Also big shout out to my buddy Giddy Up.
[04:10.490 --> 04:11.570]  I haven't seen Giddy Up in a while.
[04:11.570 --> 04:13.930]  And Giddy Up was at the secret sesh,
[04:13.930 --> 04:16.050]  rocking a Mohawk, building a stage.
[04:16.050 --> 04:17.170]  Great dude, that Giddy Up guy.
[04:17.170 --> 04:18.730]  Make sure you guys support Emotech.
[04:18.730 --> 04:20.530]  That dude just moved to Hollywood, California.
[04:20.530 --> 04:23.010]  He's young and rich and lives in Cali now.
[04:23.010 --> 04:24.130]  Good luck with that one, bro.
[04:24.130 --> 04:26.330]  Hope things go well for you.
[04:26.330 --> 04:27.890]  Big huge shout out to my buddy Jason Margulies.
[04:27.890 --> 04:29.130]  It was good seeing you there.
[04:29.130 --> 04:30.450]  Sorry I missed your lovely lady.
[04:30.450 --> 04:31.570]  It would have been good to see her
[04:31.570 --> 04:33.330]  and give her a high five and a half hug.
[04:33.330 --> 04:34.490]  You know, those one-armed hugs.
[04:34.490 --> 04:35.330]  It's what we do.
[04:35.330 --> 04:36.170]  It would have been good to see her,
[04:36.170 --> 04:37.010]  but it was good seeing you, bro.
[04:37.010 --> 04:38.050]  Next time bring the lady with you.
[04:38.050 --> 04:40.130]  We'll all hang out and take some turpy dabs.
[04:40.130 --> 04:41.490]  I think that's all the shout outs I've got
[04:41.490 --> 04:42.330]  for the secret sesh.
[04:42.330 --> 04:44.290]  You guys, I turned down edibles this time.
[04:44.290 --> 04:47.290]  I did not eat any edibles at the secret sesh.
[04:47.290 --> 04:48.570]  Shout out to TNT Extracts.
[04:48.570 --> 04:51.690]  He gave me some 200 milligram bacon.
[04:51.690 --> 04:54.690]  Yeah, he handed me bacon wrapped in parchment paper.
[04:54.690 --> 04:56.210]  And I was like, hmm, okay then.
[04:56.210 --> 04:57.730]  And I walked away and acted like I was gonna eat it.
[04:57.730 --> 05:00.290]  But of course I gave that to our buddy Bobo.
[05:00.290 --> 05:01.850]  Shout out to Bobo Blastrico.
[05:01.850 --> 05:03.290]  All the edibles I was given that night,
[05:03.290 --> 05:04.930]  I passed them right over to Bobo.
[05:04.930 --> 05:06.970]  If people, at the sesh, people just walk by you
[05:07.810 --> 05:08.650]  and hand you edibles, they're like,
[05:08.650 --> 05:09.810]  here, you need some edibles, bro, and I will take them.
[05:09.810 --> 05:11.490]  But then if I'm not in the edibles zone that night,
[05:11.490 --> 05:12.690]  I just pass them on to friends.
[05:12.690 --> 05:14.810]  Bobo got all of my excess edibles.
[05:14.810 --> 05:15.890]  He was lit up.
[05:15.890 --> 05:17.610]  That was pretty fun.
[05:17.610 --> 05:19.770]  But I'm afraid, you guys, I ate a bunch of edibles
[05:19.770 --> 05:20.650]  at the last secret sesh.
[05:20.650 --> 05:23.170]  I ate, I don't even know, a lot of edibles.
[05:23.170 --> 05:24.890]  I had a lot of THC in my body.
[05:24.890 --> 05:27.810]  I'm gonna guess somewhere between 800 and 1,500 milligrams
[05:27.810 --> 05:29.010]  of THC in my body.
[05:29.010 --> 05:30.210]  I was challenged.
[05:30.210 --> 05:31.610]  I was having a rough time.
[05:31.610 --> 05:33.730]  And then our friends at TNT Extracts
[05:33.730 --> 05:35.930]  gave me a 1,000 milligram edible.
[05:35.930 --> 05:38.530]  And I ate it for breakfast the next day on my way to work.
[05:38.530 --> 05:40.250]  And by the time I got to work,
[05:40.250 --> 05:42.690]  it felt like I had wrapped a vice around my brain
[05:42.690 --> 05:45.550]  and I was trying to function on half speed all day.
[05:45.550 --> 05:47.410]  So I've been afraid of edibles since then,
[05:47.410 --> 05:49.610]  to tell you the truth, and I haven't eaten any.
[05:49.610 --> 05:50.650]  It's been quite a while.
[05:50.650 --> 05:53.230]  I don't know if I'll do it for a little while.
[05:53.230 --> 05:55.450]  Probably go see fish and eat a couple hundred milligrams
[05:55.450 --> 05:56.290]  at the fish show.
[05:56.290 --> 05:58.210]  That might be what has to happen.
[05:58.210 --> 06:00.010]  All right, you guys, let's get to the point.
[06:00.010 --> 06:00.850]  Let's get to the point.
[06:00.850 --> 06:01.690]  The point of this podcast,
[06:01.690 --> 06:02.910]  I received an email from a friend.
[06:02.910 --> 06:03.770]  Let me open up this email.
[06:03.770 --> 06:06.210]  I've got it saved right here on the phone.
[06:06.210 --> 06:09.090]  This dude signed his name as just a noob trying to learn,
[06:09.090 --> 06:10.370]  and then he called himself Ben.
[06:10.370 --> 06:12.890]  So noob trying to learn, this question was great.
[06:12.890 --> 06:14.210]  You asked a lot of great shit,
[06:14.210 --> 06:17.330]  and you really sparked a great podcast in my opinion.
[06:17.330 --> 06:18.490]  So let me read the email.
[06:18.490 --> 06:19.730]  The email goes like this.
[06:19.730 --> 06:20.570]  Greetings, Jeff.
[06:20.570 --> 06:23.090]  First off, I wanna say thank you for the kick-ass podcast,
[06:23.090 --> 06:24.290]  and that you have taught me so much
[06:24.290 --> 06:25.730]  in these weekly sessions.
[06:25.730 --> 06:28.270]  They make my Monday morning commute tolerable.
[06:28.270 --> 06:29.690]  Dude, that's why I put them out Monday morning
[06:29.690 --> 06:30.530]  so your weekend doesn't,
[06:30.530 --> 06:33.290]  or so your week doesn't have to start with a shitty Monday.
[06:33.810 --> 06:35.610]  You start off with some kick-ass podcast material.
[06:35.610 --> 06:36.450]  I'm glad you noticed.
[06:36.450 --> 06:37.930]  Thanks for checking it out.
[06:37.930 --> 06:39.330]  So he goes on to say,
[06:39.330 --> 06:41.530]  while I have yet to grow bud because of where I live,
[06:41.530 --> 06:43.770]  the topic nonetheless consumes much of my thoughts,
[06:43.770 --> 06:46.090]  and I try to learn everything I can.
[06:46.090 --> 06:48.010]  Much of the gained knowledge has led to practices
[06:48.010 --> 06:50.570]  that have benefited my outdoor vegetable garden.
[06:50.570 --> 06:55.130]  Even still, I have what may seem to be a stupid question.
[06:55.130 --> 06:56.750]  Dude, your question is not stupid.
[06:56.750 --> 06:57.970]  I was so excited when I read this.
[06:57.970 --> 06:59.490]  I was like, ooh, I know a lot about this,
[06:59.490 --> 07:01.550]  and I'm gonna get to ramble on for a long time.
[07:01.550 --> 07:02.730]  So I'm gonna continue with the email.
[07:03.090 --> 07:05.090]  It says, it seems that many strains are named
[07:05.090 --> 07:07.250]  for a special phenotypically expressed trait
[07:07.250 --> 07:10.250]  that manifests in a particular smell, flavor, or color.
[07:10.250 --> 07:11.570]  Now, if you're lucky enough to find
[07:11.570 --> 07:13.090]  one of those desirable phenotypes
[07:13.090 --> 07:15.290]  the strain is known for when popping seeds,
[07:15.290 --> 07:17.730]  it seems that you can enjoy that treat continually
[07:17.730 --> 07:20.330]  if you had the foresight to take clones.
[07:20.330 --> 07:21.450]  Absolutely correct.
[07:21.450 --> 07:23.890]  That's why I encourage everybody,
[07:23.890 --> 07:25.930]  every time you grow a seed,
[07:25.930 --> 07:27.770]  every time it gets big enough to take a clone,
[07:27.770 --> 07:29.730]  you take a clone off of it before you flower it
[07:29.730 --> 07:31.150]  because you don't know if that seed
[07:31.150 --> 07:33.910]  is going to bear the most amazing cannabis
[07:33.910 --> 07:35.830]  you have ever smoked in your life.
[07:35.830 --> 07:37.030]  And if you don't have a clone of it,
[07:37.030 --> 07:38.830]  you might try to kick yourself in the ass
[07:38.830 --> 07:40.910]  and you're gonna be kind of mad about it.
[07:40.910 --> 07:42.750]  It's heartbreaking when you don't get a cut
[07:42.750 --> 07:45.610]  of this super amazing herb.
[07:45.610 --> 07:48.590]  I grew some, excuse me for the throat clearing.
[07:48.590 --> 07:50.510]  Of course, that's a bunch of dabs.
[07:50.510 --> 07:51.390]  Sorry about that.
[07:51.390 --> 07:55.070]  I grew some Holy Grail Kush from DNA Genetics.
[07:55.070 --> 07:58.270]  And it was honestly superb cannabis.
[07:58.270 --> 08:00.150]  If you can get your hands on some Holy Grail Kush seeds,
[08:00.150 --> 08:01.870]  I recommend that from another breeder.
[08:01.870 --> 08:02.790]  That's not even my brand.
[08:02.790 --> 08:04.230]  Get that from DNA Genetics.
[08:04.230 --> 08:06.710]  It may be a Reserva Pravada project by now.
[08:06.710 --> 08:08.790]  But Holy Grail Kush, get the real deal,
[08:08.790 --> 08:11.190]  the old school shit from DNA Genetics.
[08:11.190 --> 08:12.390]  It's amazing cannabis.
[08:12.390 --> 08:15.150]  I could not get, the phenotype I selected
[08:15.150 --> 08:17.030]  would not make clones.
[08:17.030 --> 08:18.430]  They would not root for shit.
[08:18.430 --> 08:20.590]  I put them in Rockwool, they'd shriveled up.
[08:20.590 --> 08:23.390]  I put them in a cloner, they got funky and fell apart.
[08:23.390 --> 08:25.430]  I could not get that shit to clone.
[08:25.430 --> 08:27.490]  I'll never get to taste that flavor again.
[08:27.490 --> 08:29.430]  My friend Pops is an old guy.
[08:29.750 --> 08:31.070]  He says that was one of the top five
[08:31.070 --> 08:32.590]  best pots he's ever smoked.
[08:32.590 --> 08:34.190]  And Pops is an old dude and hard to impress.
[08:34.190 --> 08:36.190]  So the Holy Grail Kush was some special shit.
[08:36.190 --> 08:37.930]  I could not get it to root.
[08:37.930 --> 08:39.350]  I wish I had a clone of that.
[08:39.350 --> 08:40.750]  It is gone.
[08:40.750 --> 08:43.710]  One of my favorite strains ever was the P91.
[08:43.710 --> 08:46.630]  And there were some serious raids of large grow facilities.
[08:46.630 --> 08:49.870]  And the P91, rumor has it, was lost in that raid.
[08:49.870 --> 08:51.430]  Somebody claims to have it,
[08:51.430 --> 08:54.990]  but I really don't know if that is what they have got.
[08:54.990 --> 08:56.310]  Anybody can claim to have it.
[08:56.310 --> 08:58.370]  So let's talk about something else you said in here.
[08:58.370 --> 08:59.530]  It seems that the strains are named
[08:59.530 --> 09:01.890]  for a special phenotypically expressed trait.
[09:01.890 --> 09:04.090]  Yes, that's why the sour diesel is called sour diesel,
[09:04.090 --> 09:05.970]  because it smells like diesel fuel.
[09:05.970 --> 09:07.850]  I think they tried to name the Girl Scout cookies that,
[09:07.850 --> 09:09.170]  because they wanted us to think
[09:09.170 --> 09:10.530]  that it tastes like Girl Scout cookies.
[09:10.530 --> 09:12.290]  It's a little bit, they call it the thin mint cut.
[09:12.290 --> 09:13.610]  If you get the thin mint,
[09:13.610 --> 09:16.090]  they taste the thin mint cookies and the thin mint cut,
[09:16.090 --> 09:18.190]  it could be close.
[09:18.190 --> 09:20.330]  So that part is totally accurate.
[09:20.330 --> 09:23.330]  Now here's what I really liked getting into
[09:23.330 --> 09:24.670]  in this part of the email.
[09:24.670 --> 09:28.130]  It says, if the traits are passed from mother to clone,
[09:28.890 --> 09:30.410]  would it be likely that the same traits would be present
[09:30.410 --> 09:32.690]  in nearly 100% of the seeds
[09:32.690 --> 09:37.150]  if you were to make feminized seeds from this plant?
[09:38.890 --> 09:40.890]  You would hope so because of logic,
[09:40.890 --> 09:42.050]  but that is not accurate.
[09:42.050 --> 09:43.770]  And I took a bunch of notes and I'll get into that.
[09:43.770 --> 09:44.990]  I'm gonna have to take a break here in a second,
[09:44.990 --> 09:46.370]  take a drink, but let me keep reading the email
[09:46.370 --> 09:47.930]  and then I'll take a drink, take a quick break,
[09:47.930 --> 09:49.170]  just because you guys don't want to hear me
[09:49.170 --> 09:51.810]  clear my throat a thousand more times.
[09:51.810 --> 09:52.650]  The email goes on to say,
[09:52.650 --> 09:54.510]  my logic may be way off on this
[09:54.510 --> 09:56.570]  as I am not a botanist or geneticist,
[09:56.570 --> 09:58.850]  but if it does play out like this,
[09:58.850 --> 10:01.530]  then why don't the seed companies grow out several plants
[10:01.530 --> 10:03.310]  to find that rare phenotype
[10:03.310 --> 10:06.170]  and then make feminized seeds from that plant?
[10:06.170 --> 10:09.130]  Any knowledge you can drop will be greatly appreciated.
[10:09.130 --> 10:11.810]  Thanks bro, from Justynube trying to learn.
[10:11.810 --> 10:13.090]  Then he signs it, Ben.
[10:13.090 --> 10:14.370]  Nube, this is a great question.
[10:14.370 --> 10:15.850]  I'm gonna press pause for just a second here,
[10:15.850 --> 10:18.010]  take a drink and then I'll be right back.
[10:18.010 --> 10:18.930]  All right, you guys, I'm back.
[10:18.930 --> 10:20.350]  Took a big fresh drink.
[10:20.350 --> 10:21.190]  I feel like I'm better.
[10:21.190 --> 10:22.030]  I'll be better for a minute.
[10:22.030 --> 10:23.330]  I'm gonna take a dab and fuck it all up again,
[10:23.330 --> 10:24.690]  but I'm better for now.
[10:24.690 --> 10:26.370]  All right, let's get back to this email.
[10:27.170 --> 10:28.450]  The part that got my attention here at the end said,
[10:28.450 --> 10:30.290]  if the traits are passed from mother to clone,
[10:30.290 --> 10:31.770]  would it be likely that the same traits
[10:31.770 --> 10:35.270]  would be present in nearly 100% of the seeds?
[10:35.270 --> 10:39.770]  Now, a clone, you're taking a cutting from an existing plant
[10:39.770 --> 10:41.410]  and that plant is making a root, of course, right?
[10:41.410 --> 10:42.970]  And then you're getting a clone,
[10:42.970 --> 10:44.090]  so all the traits are passed
[10:44.090 --> 10:47.370]  because there was no opportunity for any other chromosomes
[10:47.370 --> 10:52.370]  or genetics or traits to be introduced into that cut.
[10:52.450 --> 10:55.570]  There's nothing, you're not gonna pull DNA out of the air
[10:55.610 --> 10:56.450]  to change the traits.
[10:56.450 --> 10:59.090]  So yes, that one will be exactly like the mother
[10:59.090 --> 11:00.690]  that it came from.
[11:00.690 --> 11:01.890]  Now, when we're working with seeds,
[11:01.890 --> 11:03.770]  we have the opportunity for variation
[11:03.770 --> 11:07.950]  because we're using pollen that has chromosomes
[11:07.950 --> 11:09.990]  from the grandparents.
[11:09.990 --> 11:11.650]  You're not only getting parents,
[11:11.650 --> 11:14.650]  not only getting chromosomes from that selected phenotype,
[11:14.650 --> 11:15.690]  but you're getting chromosomes
[11:15.690 --> 11:18.570]  from whatever that plant is a cross of.
[11:18.570 --> 11:20.170]  So let me back up a little bit.
[11:20.170 --> 11:21.130]  Something that I wanna mention,
[11:21.130 --> 11:23.250]  we do search for those selected phenotypes
[11:23.250 --> 11:24.490]  that you mentioned.
[11:24.490 --> 11:27.250]  Right now I'm making a Arise F2s,
[11:27.250 --> 11:30.430]  which means I made an Arise plant, an Arise strain,
[11:30.430 --> 11:32.490]  which I took Daybreaker as the male
[11:32.490 --> 11:35.690]  and I put Daybreaker pollen on a Golden Goat female
[11:35.690 --> 11:38.610]  and I took those seeds and what came out of that,
[11:38.610 --> 11:40.090]  I named that Arise.
[11:40.090 --> 11:43.230]  So I've found a beautiful male, I've got a studly male.
[11:43.230 --> 11:45.710]  He produces the structure I want, the aroma I want.
[11:45.710 --> 11:47.290]  He makes resin.
[11:47.290 --> 11:50.370]  This male plant is a stud, so I've got that.
[11:50.370 --> 11:52.930]  And then I've got, I think right now I've got three or four
[11:52.970 --> 11:57.170]  gorgeous Arise females that I need to pick one of those
[11:57.170 --> 11:59.090]  because I wanna take that Arise male
[11:59.090 --> 12:01.650]  and I wanna put that pollen on that Arise female
[12:01.650 --> 12:03.370]  and make Arise F2s.
[12:03.370 --> 12:06.110]  And I'm doing that by selecting the perfect phenotype
[12:06.110 --> 12:08.070]  of the perfect male and the perfect female
[12:08.070 --> 12:10.110]  to bring out the traits that I'm looking for.
[12:10.110 --> 12:11.210]  Now I could screw that all up.
[12:11.210 --> 12:12.730]  I could bring out a bunch of recessive traits
[12:12.730 --> 12:13.930]  and it could be a total disaster
[12:13.930 --> 12:15.850]  and I'll have to go back and find a different male and female
[12:15.850 --> 12:17.570]  and do it all over again.
[12:17.570 --> 12:19.250]  But that's why I grow out a bunch of them myself
[12:19.250 --> 12:22.370]  before I try to sell them or give them away to anybody.
[12:22.490 --> 12:25.090]  Make sure to grow out probably a hundred of those by myself
[12:25.090 --> 12:27.390]  before anybody else will even see them.
[12:27.390 --> 12:29.270]  So we do look for those phenotypes.
[12:29.270 --> 12:31.450]  We find those perfect phenotypes.
[12:31.450 --> 12:33.530]  And sometimes a cross will be made
[12:33.530 --> 12:35.410]  that wasn't intended to smell like something.
[12:35.410 --> 12:36.410]  I don't think that Tangie,
[12:36.410 --> 12:37.890]  I don't think that the guy that made Tangie,
[12:37.890 --> 12:39.170]  I think that was Crockett.
[12:39.170 --> 12:41.090]  I don't think Crockett was like, I wanna make Tangie.
[12:41.090 --> 12:44.530]  I think Tangie should be Cali-O and this,
[12:44.530 --> 12:46.250]  whatever the hell he used, I forgot.
[12:46.250 --> 12:47.430]  But this orange plant.
[12:48.370 --> 12:49.850]  I don't think he was like, I wanna make Tangie.
[12:49.850 --> 12:50.890]  I think he crossed some shit
[12:50.890 --> 12:52.370]  that came out and tastes like tangerines.
[12:52.370 --> 12:53.530]  And he's like, that's Tangie.
[12:53.530 --> 12:54.770]  I think that's how that came.
[12:54.770 --> 12:55.690]  I don't think Sour Diesel.
[12:55.690 --> 12:56.530]  I don't think anybody was like,
[12:56.530 --> 12:58.610]  I wanna make a strain that tastes like diesel fuel.
[12:58.610 --> 13:01.450]  I think it was actually named because of that.
[13:01.450 --> 13:02.790]  So they selected that one.
[13:02.790 --> 13:04.250]  Now let's talk about something else you said.
[13:04.250 --> 13:07.810]  Why don't we use those selected phenotypes?
[13:07.810 --> 13:08.950]  We do.
[13:08.950 --> 13:11.210]  And then if I'm gonna make Femini seeds
[13:11.210 --> 13:14.490]  from that selected phenotype, I'm going to treat.
[13:14.490 --> 13:16.450]  So I'm gonna take two clones of the same plant,
[13:16.450 --> 13:18.730]  the selected phenotype that has the traits that we like,
[13:18.730 --> 13:21.490]  the one that, so we'll say Grateful Dog.
[13:21.490 --> 13:23.570]  I've made Femini seeds of Grateful Dog.
[13:23.570 --> 13:25.330]  I've grown a bunch of my own Grateful Dog seeds.
[13:25.330 --> 13:27.130]  I found the one that is stellar.
[13:27.130 --> 13:29.930]  So I take two clones of that, I reverse one,
[13:29.930 --> 13:33.390]  and I put that reversed pollen onto the female Grateful Dog.
[13:33.390 --> 13:35.870]  And now I make Grateful Dog seeds.
[13:37.070 --> 13:41.370]  Now sometimes those Grateful Dog seeds look like Chemdog.
[13:41.370 --> 13:43.250]  And sometimes those Grateful Dog seeds
[13:43.250 --> 13:46.730]  look a little bit more like San Fernando Valley OG Kush.
[13:46.730 --> 13:50.930]  But a lot of them look very much like the Grateful Dog clone
[13:50.930 --> 13:52.550]  that I reversed and started with.
[13:52.550 --> 13:54.890]  And then we'll get a little bit of variation
[13:54.890 --> 13:57.170]  that's a little closer to the chem, but more OG,
[13:57.170 --> 13:59.170]  and then a little more OG, but closer to the chem,
[13:59.170 --> 14:00.910]  and then you'll see blends of the traits.
[14:00.910 --> 14:02.290]  It's kind of like making kids, you know?
[14:02.290 --> 14:04.130]  Like your sister might look a little different from you,
[14:04.130 --> 14:05.050]  but you could definitely tell
[14:05.050 --> 14:06.610]  you're from the same gene pool.
[14:06.610 --> 14:08.690]  It's just gonna vary a little bit more from,
[14:08.690 --> 14:10.450]  so you're gonna see traits of grandma is what I'm saying.
[14:10.450 --> 14:13.170]  You're gonna see traits of grandpa is what I'm saying.
[14:13.170 --> 14:15.870]  And sometimes you might see great grandparent traits.
[14:15.870 --> 14:17.230]  So let me refer back to my notes here
[14:17.230 --> 14:18.230]  to keep myself on topic,
[14:18.230 --> 14:20.990]  because I am getting way, way off of what I'm trying to say.
[14:20.990 --> 14:23.230]  So we do search for those phenotypes,
[14:23.230 --> 14:24.750]  and that's how we make our F2s,
[14:24.750 --> 14:29.710]  and then we do reverse those to make our Feminized seeds.
[14:29.710 --> 14:32.830]  I breed with my second and third generations
[14:32.830 --> 14:36.110]  from those select, I make my second and third generations
[14:36.110 --> 14:37.190]  from those selected plants.
[14:37.190 --> 14:39.510]  And I was talking about picking one female and one female,
[14:39.510 --> 14:41.070]  something else, or one male and one female.
[14:41.070 --> 14:43.110]  Something else I also do,
[14:43.110 --> 14:46.230]  I will take multiple females of the same strain
[14:46.230 --> 14:48.530]  and one male of that strain,
[14:48.530 --> 14:50.330]  and hit three or four different females
[14:50.330 --> 14:52.030]  with that male pollen.
[14:52.030 --> 14:54.530]  And that way I've got, I can see the variation.
[14:54.530 --> 14:57.950]  I can see that this girl produces more resinous offspring.
[14:57.950 --> 15:00.730]  I can see that this girl produces tall and lanky offspring.
[15:00.730 --> 15:02.150]  So I don't wanna breed to that one again.
[15:02.150 --> 15:03.150]  Let's go ahead and get rid of that.
[15:03.150 --> 15:04.270]  I can see that this one over here
[15:04.270 --> 15:07.270]  produces really lanky plants that stink really well,
[15:07.270 --> 15:08.430]  but don't make a lot of resin.
[15:08.430 --> 15:10.390]  So maybe I don't wanna breed to that one.
[15:10.390 --> 15:12.230]  So I'll go and hit multiple females.
[15:12.230 --> 15:15.470]  So that way I can find the best breeding plants
[15:15.470 --> 15:16.510]  that I can use.
[15:16.510 --> 15:20.270]  So I'll also hit different females of different strains
[15:20.270 --> 15:21.470]  in that room with that male.
[15:21.470 --> 15:23.470]  So I'll put four females.
[15:23.470 --> 15:24.670]  So when I do this Arise F2,
[15:24.670 --> 15:25.750]  it's about to happen pretty soon.
[15:25.750 --> 15:28.750]  I'll probably put two, maybe three females of Arise
[15:28.750 --> 15:29.990]  in there to be honest.
[15:29.990 --> 15:31.910]  And then I'm gonna probably put seven or eight,
[15:31.910 --> 15:34.190]  maybe nine or 10 females of other strains in there.
[15:34.190 --> 15:35.430]  There'll be a Grateful Dog in there.
[15:35.430 --> 15:36.590]  I'm gonna put a Golden Goat in there
[15:36.590 --> 15:38.790]  to take it backwards a little bit.
[15:38.790 --> 15:40.190]  I've got some other stuff that's gonna go in there.
[15:40.190 --> 15:42.790]  I've got some crosses I made that'll go in there.
[15:42.790 --> 15:45.070]  Then I'm gonna hit all of those with pollen.
[15:45.070 --> 15:47.950]  And then we'll see what comes of all of that progeny.
[15:47.950 --> 15:49.670]  There'll be a whole bunch of great stuff in there.
[15:49.670 --> 15:51.710]  All right, let's get myself back on track.
[15:51.710 --> 15:53.870]  He said, my logic may be way off on this,
[15:53.870 --> 15:56.310]  but I am not a botanist or geneticist, which I like.
[15:56.310 --> 15:57.790]  They said, but if it does play out like this,
[15:57.790 --> 16:00.230]  then why don't the seed companies grow out several plants
[16:00.230 --> 16:01.390]  to find the rare phenotypes
[16:01.390 --> 16:04.150]  and then make feminize seeds from that plant?
[16:04.150 --> 16:07.190]  Well, that's kind of exactly what they slash we do,
[16:07.190 --> 16:08.030]  my friend.
[16:08.030 --> 16:09.070]  I hope I explained that in a way
[16:09.070 --> 16:10.310]  that makes a lot of sense to you.
[16:10.310 --> 16:12.670]  One thing I wanna go back over is the word phenotype.
[16:12.670 --> 16:14.870]  I hear a lot of people say phenome.
[16:14.870 --> 16:19.870]  It's a pheno, P-H-E-N-O, phenotype, phenotypical expression.
[16:20.150 --> 16:21.830]  Pheno, not phenome,
[16:21.830 --> 16:24.550]  just to make you sound cooler in your circle.
[16:24.550 --> 16:27.630]  So when you're making seeds and those seeds do come out,
[16:27.630 --> 16:29.070]  of course, variation is natural.
[16:29.070 --> 16:30.590]  That's something that we expect.
[16:30.590 --> 16:32.230]  We can't control it completely.
[16:32.230 --> 16:34.110]  If you wanna make something that I did
[16:34.110 --> 16:36.510]  that I didn't even realize I was doing something
[16:36.510 --> 16:38.410]  out of the norm, I made feminized seeds.
[16:38.410 --> 16:42.290]  And then I found my favorite phenotype
[16:42.290 --> 16:44.090]  out of that batch of feminized seeds.
[16:44.090 --> 16:46.610]  And then I hit that feminized plant
[16:46.610 --> 16:49.850]  with the original pollen that I made feminized seeds from.
[16:49.850 --> 16:52.330]  And the progeny from that was super stable.
[16:52.330 --> 16:53.570]  And I did it again.
[16:53.570 --> 16:55.610]  And then I tried to reverse one of those plants
[16:55.610 --> 16:57.150]  and I could not get it to reverse.
[16:57.150 --> 16:59.050]  I could not make the plant herm.
[16:59.050 --> 17:01.010]  I could not change the sex of that plant
[17:01.010 --> 17:02.250]  to make more feminized seeds
[17:02.250 --> 17:05.030]  with that generation of that progeny.
[17:05.030 --> 17:07.610]  And I was super impressed with the stability of that plant.
[17:07.610 --> 17:09.050]  That plant is still around.
[17:09.050 --> 17:11.130]  It's been named GD77.
[17:11.130 --> 17:13.410]  A lot of people ask me about my naming schemes.
[17:13.410 --> 17:14.850]  They're very random.
[17:14.850 --> 17:17.050]  Grateful Dog was GD.
[17:17.050 --> 17:20.370]  1977 is one of my favorite years of the Grateful Dead.
[17:20.370 --> 17:24.130]  So GD77, it's the Grateful Dead 77 Pheno.
[17:24.130 --> 17:25.170]  I love it.
[17:25.170 --> 17:27.010]  It's in the mother room right now.
[17:27.010 --> 17:28.110]  That's one of my favorite keepers.
[17:28.110 --> 17:30.010]  I've probably had that one for,
[17:30.010 --> 17:30.890]  I don't even know how long.
[17:30.890 --> 17:31.930]  I really can't remember.
[17:31.930 --> 17:33.850]  I've had it for a super long time.
[17:33.850 --> 17:34.850]  Long time, eight years.
[17:34.850 --> 17:36.730]  I'll say eight years I've had that clone.
[17:36.730 --> 17:38.390]  All right, let's get back on track here.
[17:38.390 --> 17:39.330]  I like the variation.
[17:39.330 --> 17:40.170]  That's what I'm saying.
[17:40.170 --> 17:40.990]  Variation is cool.
[17:40.990 --> 17:42.330]  When you're making seeds, I like variation.
[17:42.330 --> 17:43.890]  I don't want every seed to grow out
[17:43.890 --> 17:45.210]  just like the picture on the package
[17:45.210 --> 17:47.310]  because everyone's got that one.
[17:47.310 --> 17:48.650]  I want a little bit of variation.
[17:48.650 --> 17:50.090]  That means that the grower down the street
[17:50.090 --> 17:51.330]  that bought those seeds doesn't have
[17:51.330 --> 17:52.610]  the phenotype that I've got.
[17:52.610 --> 17:55.650]  And that means that there might be something better in there.
[17:55.650 --> 17:57.490]  That means you can always keep growing more seeds.
[17:57.490 --> 17:58.690]  That's why I always, that's why I love seeds.
[17:58.690 --> 18:01.730]  You might find something better than what you've already got.
[18:01.730 --> 18:03.250]  Sometimes when somebody loses a plant
[18:03.250 --> 18:05.370]  or if something doesn't root, when you try to clone it,
[18:05.370 --> 18:06.410]  I always look at the bright side.
[18:07.090 --> 18:08.050]  That means I get to grow more seeds
[18:08.050 --> 18:09.610]  because seeds are the way to go.
[18:09.610 --> 18:10.450]  Seeds have vigor.
[18:10.450 --> 18:11.530]  You can find new shit in there.
[18:11.530 --> 18:13.290]  Every strain that you're smoking,
[18:13.290 --> 18:14.950]  every clone that you've ever grown,
[18:14.950 --> 18:16.130]  that came from a seed.
[18:17.370 --> 18:18.530]  Right, it had to.
[18:18.530 --> 18:21.330]  So the variation, of course, you could stabilize that
[18:21.330 --> 18:22.990]  just by breeding.
[18:22.990 --> 18:24.290]  Make F2s, make F3s.
[18:24.290 --> 18:27.210]  By the time you get to F5, those seeds will be super stable.
[18:27.210 --> 18:29.970]  You'll start making seeds that produce almost clones.
[18:29.970 --> 18:31.730]  Once you get to the F6 generation,
[18:33.030 --> 18:34.850]  probably 90% of the seeds that you plant
[18:34.850 --> 18:37.030]  are going to look just like the picture on the package
[18:37.030 --> 18:38.630]  if the breeder did it properly.
[18:38.630 --> 18:40.170]  All right, you guys, I'm gonna take a dab and a drink
[18:40.170 --> 18:41.290]  and I'm gonna get another email to you.
[18:41.290 --> 18:42.770]  Before I do that, I wanna give a big shout out
[18:42.770 --> 18:44.850]  to our buddy, The Noob, that sent us this email.
[18:44.850 --> 18:45.690]  I really appreciate it.
[18:45.690 --> 18:47.110]  I like talking about feminized seeds.
[18:47.110 --> 18:48.330]  I like talking about making seeds.
[18:48.330 --> 18:49.270]  I like talking about breeding.
[18:49.270 --> 18:50.890]  That's some of my favorite shit.
[18:50.890 --> 18:52.450]  So if you have more questions about that,
[18:52.450 --> 18:55.050]  send them to me, growfromyourheartathotmail.com
[18:55.050 --> 18:57.530]  and I will read your emails on a future episode.
[18:57.530 --> 18:59.370]  Guys, I need a drink and a dab.
[18:59.370 --> 19:00.250]  Bear with me.
[19:00.250 --> 19:02.210]  Play some reggae music and you can hang out for a second.

[20:01.320 --> 20:02.800]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I am back.
[20:02.800 --> 20:04.920]  Took a drink, did not take some dabs this time.
[20:04.920 --> 20:06.360]  I think I have a voice.
[20:06.360 --> 20:07.740]  I think my throat is gonna hold up
[20:07.740 --> 20:09.360]  for at least a couple more emails.
[20:09.360 --> 20:10.800]  All right, let's get to another email.
[20:10.800 --> 20:13.660]  This one says, Rasta J, recently discovered
[20:13.660 --> 20:16.360]  my latest batch of girls are not as innocent as I would like.
[20:16.360 --> 20:18.920]  Yes, they are flat ass full of seeds.
[20:18.920 --> 20:21.760]  My question for you is if there are any dead giveaways
[20:21.760 --> 20:25.200]  to determine if they were pollinated or simply hermed.
[20:25.200 --> 20:28.320]  I did have a sneaky male get by me until about week three.
[20:28.320 --> 20:31.260]  I had him labeled wrong and stuck him in the flower room.
[20:31.260 --> 20:34.160]  I'm hoping this is the case and not a herm issue.
[20:34.160 --> 20:36.080]  Then he continues to give me reasons
[20:36.080 --> 20:40.000]  why his plants may have hermed and dude, he had a male.
[20:40.000 --> 20:41.680]  He fucked up, you got a boy in there.
[20:41.680 --> 20:43.680]  That male at three weeks, he busted a nut,
[20:43.680 --> 20:45.140]  he pollinated your girls.
[20:45.140 --> 20:47.000]  Do you know what that male was?
[20:47.000 --> 20:47.840]  That's my question.
[20:47.840 --> 20:49.080]  If you know what that male plant was,
[20:49.080 --> 20:51.640]  you may have accidentally just bred some shit.
[20:51.640 --> 20:53.440]  Keep those seeds, grow them out, see what you got.
[20:53.440 --> 20:55.120]  Yeah, I'm pretty sure that that male dropped pollen.
[20:55.120 --> 20:58.200]  It only takes about 14 days for some of those studlier males
[20:58.200 --> 21:00.080]  to just start blowing pollen everywhere.
[21:00.080 --> 21:02.600]  So if you had him in there until about week three,
[21:02.600 --> 21:05.560]  I'm pretty sure that's who hit those girls with pollen.
[21:05.560 --> 21:07.160]  From the list of things you mentioned
[21:07.160 --> 21:09.440]  that may be reasons why those plants hermed,
[21:09.440 --> 21:12.720]  it does not look likely to me.
[21:12.720 --> 21:15.600]  The recent switch of lighting, that would not do it.
[21:15.600 --> 21:16.760]  The slight foxtailing you mentioned,
[21:16.760 --> 21:17.920]  that's because they got too hot.
[21:17.920 --> 21:19.840]  I don't think that made them herm.
[21:19.840 --> 21:21.780]  So you had a dude in there.
[21:21.780 --> 21:25.040]  You guys, when you have male, if you were growing from seed,
[21:25.040 --> 21:27.720]  or if you have a male plant, I have males in my stable.
[21:27.720 --> 21:29.880]  I got a couple of big fat male arise plants in there.
[21:29.880 --> 21:32.120]  I got Solomon just chilling, he's kicking it.
[21:32.120 --> 21:33.200]  It's like three feet tall.
[21:33.200 --> 21:35.280]  But if you're growing from seed and you got boy plants,
[21:35.280 --> 21:36.840]  those boy plants will drop pollen.
[21:36.840 --> 21:40.040]  I've actually got a strawberry tangy banana male plant
[21:40.040 --> 21:41.080]  in a very small pot.
[21:41.080 --> 21:43.360]  It's getting root bound and I can see male flower clusters
[21:43.360 --> 21:44.500]  forming on the top.
[21:45.420 --> 21:47.740]  If I don't get that out of there in the next 10 days,
[21:47.740 --> 21:49.780]  he will drop pollen, that pollen will come from there.
[21:49.780 --> 21:51.100]  So if you're growing from seed,
[21:51.100 --> 21:52.420]  keep an eye on those pollen sacks.
[21:52.420 --> 21:53.820]  And if you don't want seeded plants,
[21:53.820 --> 21:56.400]  if you don't want pollen, don't be lazy.
[21:56.400 --> 21:57.600]  Get those males out of there.
[21:57.600 --> 21:59.840]  This dude's a perfect example of why you don't wanna have
[21:59.840 --> 22:00.860]  males in your garden.
[22:00.860 --> 22:02.540]  He's got seeds now.
[22:02.540 --> 22:03.900]  That brings me to something I've wanted to say
[22:03.900 --> 22:06.020]  for a little while and haven't had the opportunity.
[22:06.020 --> 22:07.860]  You're running a garden and there's some shit
[22:07.860 --> 22:08.740]  that needs to be done.
[22:08.740 --> 22:10.380]  Do it today, don't do it tomorrow.
[22:10.380 --> 22:11.580]  Why wait?
[22:11.580 --> 22:13.020]  That's your garden, that's your love,
[22:13.020 --> 22:14.460]  that's your medicine, that's your product.
[22:15.300 --> 22:16.140]  If you're growing for commercial,
[22:16.140 --> 22:17.100]  if you're growing for medicinal,
[22:17.100 --> 22:20.020]  if you're growing just for love, do that shit today.
[22:20.020 --> 22:21.060]  Those plants are alive.
[22:21.060 --> 22:22.740]  You wouldn't, if your dog was hungry
[22:22.740 --> 22:23.660]  and your dog needed water,
[22:23.660 --> 22:25.100]  you wouldn't make the dog wait till tomorrow.
[22:25.100 --> 22:26.140]  Why do you make the plants wait?
[22:26.140 --> 22:27.540]  Love those plants, they're yours.
[22:27.540 --> 22:28.420]  You gotta care for them.
[22:28.420 --> 22:30.060]  Respect the plants.
[22:30.060 --> 22:31.380]  Anything that needs to be done in the grow room.
[22:31.380 --> 22:33.980]  If that bulb is dirty or if that bulb is dead,
[22:33.980 --> 22:36.420]  that lens is dirty, if that ducting is funky,
[22:36.420 --> 22:37.500]  don't do that shit tomorrow.
[22:37.500 --> 22:38.420]  Do that shit today.
[22:38.420 --> 22:39.260]  Don't be a lazy bitch.
[22:39.260 --> 22:41.060]  Get in there, clean your garden, take care of that shit.
[22:41.060 --> 22:42.900]  Do it today, love your plants.
[22:42.940 --> 22:44.860]  That garden, that crop is only gonna be in flower
[22:44.860 --> 22:49.660]  for 63 days, 56, 63, maybe 70 days if you're going hard.
[22:49.660 --> 22:50.860]  Why not make every day count?
[22:50.860 --> 22:51.900]  Get in there and do that shit right.
[22:51.900 --> 22:53.060]  Do it today.
[22:53.060 --> 22:54.220]  Put some love into those plants.
[22:54.220 --> 22:55.460]  All right, I'll quit bitching at you, I'm sorry.
[22:55.460 --> 22:56.860]  I feel like I kinda got on ya.
[22:56.860 --> 22:57.820]  Just love your plants, you guys.
[22:57.820 --> 22:59.180]  Get in there, take care of that shit.
[22:59.180 --> 23:01.380]  You claim to love your garden, go love it.
[23:01.380 --> 23:02.980]  All right, I've got another message I wanna read.
[23:02.980 --> 23:04.860]  Remember a few episodes ago,
[23:04.860 --> 23:06.220]  we had a listener send an email
[23:06.220 --> 23:09.700]  asking about recommendations for dispensaries in Denver.
[23:09.700 --> 23:12.180]  And I took a screenshot of his latest message.
[23:12.220 --> 23:14.260]  He sent me this message on Instagram.
[23:14.260 --> 23:16.300]  And it says, Rasta Jeff, wanted to thank you
[23:16.300 --> 23:17.980]  for reading my email on your podcast
[23:17.980 --> 23:20.340]  and for recommending Natty Rems.
[23:20.340 --> 23:21.700]  My wife and I loved our trip.
[23:21.700 --> 23:23.140]  I wanted to let you know that Stitcher
[23:23.140 --> 23:25.740]  has all of your episodes, starting at episode 40,
[23:25.740 --> 23:27.180]  all the way to the current episode.
[23:27.180 --> 23:30.220]  Keep those beautiful Instagram images coming
[23:30.220 --> 23:31.980]  from our friend Fats.
[23:31.980 --> 23:33.220]  That's a great message to read.
[23:33.220 --> 23:35.660]  There's so much good shit in there.
[23:35.660 --> 23:37.220]  Man, I'm glad you enjoyed Natty Rems.
[23:37.220 --> 23:38.980]  I'm glad Colorado was super kind to you.
[23:38.980 --> 23:41.340]  I'm glad that you and your wife had a great trip.
[23:41.620 --> 23:44.060]  I'm also glad to hear that all of the episodes
[23:44.060 --> 23:46.140]  starting at episode 40 are on Stitcher.
[23:46.140 --> 23:46.980]  That's awesome.
[23:46.980 --> 23:48.220]  That means that everybody can listen
[23:48.220 --> 23:50.620]  all the way back to episode 40.
[23:50.620 --> 23:53.140]  It's probably 44-ish by now.
[23:53.140 --> 23:54.500]  It's 45 by the time this comes out.
[23:54.500 --> 23:57.120]  That means they're gonna keep 100 episodes on there.
[23:57.120 --> 23:57.980]  That's cool, awesome.
[23:57.980 --> 23:59.540]  So there are 100 episodes of this podcast
[23:59.540 --> 24:01.100]  available on Stitcher, you guys.
[24:01.100 --> 24:03.300]  If you wanna go listen to 100 episodes of the show,
[24:03.300 --> 24:06.020]  I encourage you to go back and listen to old episodes.
[24:06.020 --> 24:07.380]  One of my favorites, I think,
[24:07.380 --> 24:11.740]  is the Scheduling Your Perpetual Grow episode.
[24:11.740 --> 24:13.660]  That episode, that should have been a million-dollar
[24:13.660 --> 24:15.580]  book idea, so make sure you listen to that one for me.
[24:15.580 --> 24:17.780]  If you haven't heard that one, go listen to it.
[24:17.780 --> 24:18.740]  That's a great episode.
[24:18.740 --> 24:20.200]  I think it's number 72.
[24:20.200 --> 24:22.420]  I'm gonna be a responsible podcast host and press pause
[24:22.420 --> 24:24.580]  and go make sure what number that is.
[24:24.580 --> 24:26.240]  All right, I found the information I wanted to find,
[24:26.240 --> 24:27.780]  but I wanted to let you guys know something funny
[24:27.780 --> 24:28.940]  that I just did.
[24:28.940 --> 24:31.860]  My buddy John Hunt gave me a pencil dabber.
[24:31.860 --> 24:34.180]  It is made out of green stardust glass,
[24:34.180 --> 24:37.340]  and it's got some colored tips and a colored eraser,
[24:38.100 --> 24:40.300]  or a colored tip where the pencil end would be,
[24:40.300 --> 24:41.800]  and a colored tip where the eraser end would be.
[24:41.800 --> 24:42.640]  It's made out of glass.
[24:42.640 --> 24:43.960]  It's meant to be used as a dabber,
[24:43.960 --> 24:45.580]  and my high ass just picked it up
[24:45.580 --> 24:47.700]  and tried to write a fucking note on my notepad
[24:47.700 --> 24:49.380]  with the dabber pencil.
[24:49.380 --> 24:53.580]  So, shout out to Cannabis and THC for that shit.
[24:53.580 --> 24:55.060]  You guys, the episode I was actually referring to
[24:55.060 --> 24:56.080]  is number 73.
[24:56.080 --> 24:57.660]  Make sure you check out episode number 73.
[24:57.660 --> 24:59.420]  It's Scheduling Your Perpetual Grow.
[24:59.420 --> 25:01.140]  I feel like that episode should have been
[25:01.140 --> 25:02.220]  a million-dollar episode.
[25:02.220 --> 25:03.060]  While we're going through it,
[25:03.060 --> 25:05.460]  check out number 76 about pheno hunting.
[25:06.180 --> 25:07.580]  And then if you wanna learn about outdoor,
[25:07.580 --> 25:11.260]  our friend Jesse comes by, episode number 79.
[25:11.260 --> 25:13.500]  But definitely go back and check out 73.
[25:13.500 --> 25:15.540]  And number 55 is one of my favorite episodes.
[25:15.540 --> 25:19.020]  If you're new to the podcast, make sure you check out 55.
[25:19.020 --> 25:20.060]  I've thought about going back
[25:20.060 --> 25:22.180]  and releasing some of the older episodes
[25:22.180 --> 25:24.300]  on a Thursday, like a midweek episode.
[25:24.300 --> 25:26.020]  So maybe once some of those older episodes
[25:26.020 --> 25:26.940]  fall out of the feed,
[25:26.940 --> 25:28.260]  once I put so many episodes in
[25:28.260 --> 25:31.540]  that there's like 50 more that I can repost,
[25:31.540 --> 25:33.740]  I'll go back and put those up on a Thursday or something
[25:33.740 --> 25:34.860]  so that they're still in the feed
[25:35.260 --> 25:36.100]  and you guys can listen to them
[25:36.100 --> 25:36.940]  because there are some great episodes
[25:36.940 --> 25:39.500]  that need to stay up for a little longer.
[25:39.500 --> 25:42.160]  All right, let's get this show back on track, you guys.
[25:42.160 --> 25:43.340]  Big shout out to our friend Fats.
[25:43.340 --> 25:44.820]  I do appreciate the interaction.
[25:44.820 --> 25:46.260]  Dude, next time you're in Colorado,
[25:46.260 --> 25:47.100]  give me a heads up.
[25:47.100 --> 25:48.260]  We'll get together, we'll smoke some turps,
[25:48.260 --> 25:50.620]  we'll take some selfies, we'll have a good old time.
[25:50.620 --> 25:52.600]  You guys, if you wanna send me a message or an email,
[25:52.600 --> 25:54.780]  or if you wanna hit me up somehow, email me.
[25:54.780 --> 25:56.380]  GrowFromYourHeartAtHotmail.com.
[25:56.380 --> 25:57.300]  I'll read your message.
[25:57.300 --> 25:59.580]  On a future episode, I will answer your questions.
[25:59.580 --> 26:00.980]  If you wanna follow me on Instagram,
[26:00.980 --> 26:03.540]  it's at irie underscore genetics.
[26:03.540 --> 26:05.060]  If you wanna follow me on Facebook,
[26:05.060 --> 26:07.260]  just search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[26:07.260 --> 26:08.300]  I would appreciate it.
[26:08.300 --> 26:11.100]  In an upcoming episode, my buddy Sammy sent me an email
[26:11.100 --> 26:12.260]  asking about easy cloners.
[26:12.260 --> 26:13.780]  I'm gonna talk about that a little bit.
[26:13.780 --> 26:17.300]  And I will also talk about how to set your email
[26:17.300 --> 26:20.180]  to the appropriate temp for your liking.
[26:20.180 --> 26:22.300]  Somebody sent me a question about my dream grow.
[26:22.300 --> 26:25.220]  I'm gonna kinda talk about that on an upcoming episode.
[26:25.220 --> 26:27.620]  Then I also have an episode,
[26:27.620 --> 26:29.180]  another question from a listener.
[26:29.180 --> 26:31.820]  I've got an episode about identifying issues in your garden.
[26:31.820 --> 26:33.000]  And then in a future episode,
[26:33.440 --> 26:35.200]  I will talk about how to treat and prevent
[26:35.200 --> 26:38.720]  most of those issues and or problems.
[26:38.720 --> 26:40.040]  So if you guys have some content
[26:40.040 --> 26:40.960]  that you would like me to talk about,
[26:40.960 --> 26:42.080]  I encourage you to send me an email.
[26:42.080 --> 26:43.420]  Most of the episodes lately
[26:43.420 --> 26:45.480]  have come from listener questions.
[26:45.480 --> 26:47.720]  This podcast, this comes from my heart,
[26:47.720 --> 26:49.160]  but this podcast is for you.
[26:49.160 --> 26:50.560]  This isn't for me, this is for you.
[26:50.560 --> 26:51.720]  And I love doing it.
[26:51.720 --> 26:52.960]  So if you give me some content,
[26:52.960 --> 26:56.120]  I would love to read your stuff on the air.
[26:56.120 --> 26:58.560]  Get you guys going, get you growing, help you guys out.
[26:58.560 --> 26:59.840]  If you got something that you'd like to say
[26:59.840 --> 27:01.520]  and you're not in all that social media stuff,
[27:01.520 --> 27:02.360]  all you gotta do is email me,
[27:02.880 --> 27:03.720]  growthmeahardouthotmail.com.
[27:03.720 --> 27:04.540]  You can remain anonymous
[27:04.540 --> 27:06.280]  and won't see your name on the air.
[27:06.280 --> 27:07.120]  I'll keep you safe.
[27:07.120 --> 27:08.540]  I don't know what state you're in,
[27:08.540 --> 27:10.920]  so I don't wanna get you in any trouble.
