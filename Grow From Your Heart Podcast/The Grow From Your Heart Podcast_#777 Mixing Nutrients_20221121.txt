[01:31.350 --> 01:36.410]  Speaking of support, I owe everybody a big thank you for all of the support on the early
[01:36.410 --> 01:38.150]  Black Friday sale.
[01:38.150 --> 01:39.150]  That's right.
[01:39.150 --> 01:42.670]  If you are a member of the Patreon, you got a notification that came with a coupon code
[01:42.670 --> 01:47.630]  letting you know that the Black Friday sale is now active on iridirect.com.
[01:47.630 --> 01:48.630]  That's right.
[01:48.630 --> 01:50.830]  Check out iridirect.com for all the current stock.
[01:50.830 --> 01:55.030]  Things will last until Black Friday, but a lot of the new drops will be sold out right
[01:55.030 --> 01:56.030]  after Black Friday.
[01:56.030 --> 02:00.230]  I've got enough on there to last about the week, maybe a little bit more, but they will
[02:00.230 --> 02:01.230]  sell out.
[02:01.230 --> 02:05.990]  So make sure you grab the Black Friday deals before they are gone at iridirect.com.
[02:06.990 --> 02:10.350]  All right, that should wrap up all of the business part of this podcast.
[02:10.350 --> 02:13.310]  Let's move our way into the fun part of this episode.
[02:13.310 --> 02:17.310]  I've been doing, I'm not sure if it's been an experiment on myself or if I've been noticing
[02:17.310 --> 02:23.510]  something about myself, but I noticed that last week I could smoke everything and not
[02:23.510 --> 02:25.350]  get the buzz I desired.
[02:25.350 --> 02:27.190]  I could smoke all of the concentrates.
[02:27.190 --> 02:28.590]  I could smoke all the flowers.
[02:28.590 --> 02:34.550]  I ate some edibles and I was just not achieving the level of medication or the buzz level
[02:34.630 --> 02:37.510]  that I was trying to achieve and I was getting frustrated with it.
[02:37.510 --> 02:38.510]  I was just smoking more.
[02:38.510 --> 02:42.630]  I thought maybe I need to take a little bit of a break, but then this week, I don't know
[02:42.630 --> 02:45.910]  what's going on, but things have balanced themselves out.
[02:45.910 --> 02:49.930]  This week, all I have to do is take a little tiny itty bitty little dab and I feel like
[02:49.930 --> 02:51.270]  I'm just completely wrecked.
[02:51.270 --> 02:53.310]  I'm getting so lit off of my dabs.
[02:53.310 --> 02:57.950]  I'm making up for the excessive consumption last week and I'm saving some this week just
[02:57.950 --> 03:00.790]  because when I do smoke, I'm getting extra lit.
[03:00.790 --> 03:05.350]  My question to you is, do you go through phases where sometimes you can look at your
[03:05.350 --> 03:09.630]  dabs and catch a nice buzz or other times when you can smoke all of the dabs and not
[03:09.630 --> 03:11.210]  even get a buzz at all?
[03:11.210 --> 03:12.310]  Is that just me?
[03:12.310 --> 03:13.510]  Is that something seasonally?
[03:13.510 --> 03:17.270]  Is that something with my diet, something with my mood, something with blood sugar,
[03:17.270 --> 03:18.270]  brain chemistry?
[03:18.270 --> 03:20.590]  Who knows what's going on, but I want to know, is it just me?
[03:20.590 --> 03:23.350]  Does that sort of stuff happen to you also?
[03:23.350 --> 03:24.350]  Send me a message.
[03:24.350 --> 03:28.110]  GrowFromYourHeart at Hotmail.com or hit me on Twitter or social media.
[03:28.110 --> 03:29.110]  Let me know.
[03:29.110 --> 03:33.070]  I'm the only one going through this weird phenomena of where sometimes I can buy a few
[03:33.070 --> 03:36.950]  grams of concentrates and they'll last me a week and then sometimes I can buy the same
[03:36.950 --> 03:39.830]  amount of concentrates and it will last me a day.
[03:39.830 --> 03:42.430]  Is it just me or do you do that also?
[03:42.430 --> 03:47.750]  Let me know because man, last week I smoked double what I normally smoke and this week
[03:47.750 --> 03:51.310]  I'm smoking half of what I normally smoke and I really notice a huge difference, but
[03:51.310 --> 03:55.870]  I'm not doing anything differently diet wise or life or physically wise.
[03:55.870 --> 04:00.030]  It just seems to be the only difference is it's colder now and that doesn't really, I
[04:00.030 --> 04:01.230]  don't think that makes a difference.
[04:01.230 --> 04:02.430]  It is super cold today.
[04:02.430 --> 04:04.190]  It hasn't been so cold.
[04:04.190 --> 04:05.390]  I don't know if that makes any sense.
[04:05.390 --> 04:07.310]  All right, where do we go from there?
[04:07.310 --> 04:09.630]  All right, let's segue into our next topic.
[04:09.630 --> 04:12.370]  I've got something I think will be fun to talk about.
[04:12.370 --> 04:17.810]  My question to you is, are you doing things in your garden that are completely useless
[04:17.810 --> 04:21.590]  because they are a ritual, they are a habit?
[04:21.590 --> 04:25.710]  Maybe you were doing it because one of your uncle's friends did it in the 70s and he told
[04:25.750 --> 04:28.470]  you you could do it and you tried it and you just never stopped.
[04:28.470 --> 04:31.830]  My idea and my question is, are you doing things in your garden just because you've
[04:31.830 --> 04:35.190]  been programmed to do it because you think it might be doing something because you saw
[04:35.190 --> 04:36.670]  somebody else doing it?
[04:36.670 --> 04:41.990]  Do you have a rhyme and a reason and a method for everything that is happening in your garden?
[04:41.990 --> 04:46.230]  I've noticed some people are just doing some things just because it's a habit and they
[04:46.230 --> 04:49.950]  don't know why they're actually doing the steps that they are doing.
[04:49.950 --> 04:54.030]  We spend a lot of time, money, energy and effort on our garden and we hope to have a
[04:54.030 --> 04:55.690]  beautiful outcome.
[04:55.690 --> 04:59.610]  If we can streamline the amount of time we spend in there, the amount of money and the
[04:59.610 --> 05:03.210]  amount of energy that we have to put into that garden and still get a quality outcome,
[05:03.210 --> 05:04.490]  I think that helps us out.
[05:04.490 --> 05:10.090]  One of my jobs as a consultant is to go to your commercial facility, walk around for
[05:10.090 --> 05:13.850]  a day, view your grow, your employees, your plants and see what's happening and then it
[05:13.850 --> 05:16.570]  is my job to make that grow more proficient.
[05:16.570 --> 05:22.370]  If it's better production, less cost, I'm there to increase productivity and save money.
[05:22.370 --> 05:25.330]  There are several ways you could probably do that in your grow.
[05:25.330 --> 05:29.490]  I'm not at your grow so I don't know what's going on but the next time you're in there,
[05:29.490 --> 05:30.490]  think about it.
[05:30.490 --> 05:33.130]  Are the moves and steps that I'm making, are they necessary?
[05:33.130 --> 05:36.690]  Think about from the minute you open the door to that grow to when you start mixing your
[05:36.690 --> 05:41.090]  nutrients to when you check your pH to where you do everything in that grow, when you touch
[05:41.090 --> 05:45.430]  the plants, when you whatever you're doing, is there a rhyme and a reason for it?
[05:45.430 --> 05:48.390]  Think about why am I doing the action I am doing right now?
[05:48.390 --> 05:50.470]  What does this do to my plants?
[05:50.470 --> 05:56.270]  What does it do to my plants right now, later today, tomorrow, in three days, in seven days,
[05:56.270 --> 05:59.950]  in two weeks, in the long run, before harvest time?
[05:59.950 --> 06:04.430]  Think about the full outcome of everything you were doing to those plants.
[06:04.430 --> 06:09.790]  Keep in mind that the things you do to your plants today may not show you results or benefits
[06:09.790 --> 06:10.790]  very soon.
[06:10.790 --> 06:13.010]  It may be two, three, five, seven days.
[06:13.010 --> 06:17.730]  It could be two weeks, five weeks, maybe nine weeks down the line before you see the results
[06:17.730 --> 06:18.730]  of what you did.
[06:18.730 --> 06:20.190]  Is it consequences or rewards?
[06:20.190 --> 06:23.330]  We may not know, so go slow.
[06:23.330 --> 06:24.970]  Think twice before you cut anything.
[06:24.970 --> 06:28.750]  You can't put shit back on, but you can cut shit off.
[06:28.750 --> 06:29.750]  Don't overfeed.
[06:29.750 --> 06:33.310]  You can feed more, but you can't take back food.
[06:33.310 --> 06:37.450]  Think about every move you are making before you make it in that grow and think about does
[06:37.450 --> 06:38.650]  this have a reason?
[06:38.650 --> 06:39.850]  Does this have a purpose?
[06:39.850 --> 06:42.150]  Why am I doing this in the grow?
[06:42.150 --> 06:46.790]  Like I said earlier, maybe I told you something years ago, you should do this and you've been
[06:46.790 --> 06:48.590]  doing that in your grow.
[06:48.590 --> 06:50.150]  Maybe your style has changed.
[06:50.150 --> 06:51.430]  Maybe your room has changed.
[06:51.430 --> 06:52.770]  Maybe your equipment changed.
[06:52.770 --> 06:56.070]  That thing I told you might not even be necessary anymore.
[06:56.070 --> 07:01.310]  My grow evolves and changes probably more quickly than a lot of people because I have
[07:01.310 --> 07:03.130]  a lot more input and also more experience.
[07:03.130 --> 07:06.430]  I'm not as afraid to experiment and maybe kill a couple of plants.
[07:06.430 --> 07:08.290]  That's another thing I should talk about.
[07:08.290 --> 07:11.830]  Don't get so trapped into your routine that you're afraid to try new things.
[07:11.830 --> 07:16.310]  Be able to maybe risk a plant or two and that's how you learn and how you expand and how you
[07:16.310 --> 07:17.310]  improve.
[07:17.310 --> 07:19.930]  If you don't take risks, you will not get better.
[07:20.710 --> 07:24.290]  What I'm saying is, are you doing things in your grow because it's a habit, because you
[07:24.290 --> 07:28.370]  learned it from somebody a long time ago and you've just been doing it or does every step
[07:28.370 --> 07:32.490]  of your grow have a purpose, a rhyme, a reason and a method?
[07:32.490 --> 07:33.930]  Why are you doing that?
[07:33.930 --> 07:37.490]  If you can eliminate that step and save yourself some time, don't do it.
[07:37.490 --> 07:41.850]  If you can eliminate a product or a step that'll save you money, that's beneficial right away.
[07:41.850 --> 07:43.570]  We all like saving more money.
[07:43.570 --> 07:45.850]  You can buy yourself more things.
[07:45.850 --> 07:48.490]  But try to have a reason for everything you were doing in that grow.
[07:48.530 --> 07:51.490]  If I were there watching you and I said, hey bro, why did you do that?
[07:51.490 --> 07:54.250]  You should have a solid reason of I did that because of this.
[07:54.250 --> 07:56.050]  Not just I do that every time.
[07:56.050 --> 07:58.490]  I've been doing that for years.
[07:58.490 --> 07:59.750]  Why do you do that every time?
[07:59.750 --> 08:01.170]  Why have you been doing that for years?
[08:01.170 --> 08:03.850]  What is your reason for the actions you are taking?
[08:03.850 --> 08:06.250]  Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.
[08:06.250 --> 08:07.330]  Are you getting a benefit?
[08:07.330 --> 08:09.430]  Are you messing up your plants?
[08:09.430 --> 08:10.430]  What are you doing?
[08:10.430 --> 08:12.010]  Let's think about everything we're doing in there.
[08:12.010 --> 08:16.770]  I want to give a big shout out to my dogs because this part of the show is inspired
[08:16.770 --> 08:17.770]  by my dogs.
[08:18.050 --> 08:20.130]  I'm going to tell you a funny short story here.
[08:20.130 --> 08:22.130]  I got into a relationship with a lovely lady.
[08:22.130 --> 08:24.290]  She had two puppies.
[08:24.290 --> 08:27.410]  When you get out of the shower at that house, those two puppies, they're not puppies, they're
[08:27.410 --> 08:28.610]  small terrier dogs.
[08:28.610 --> 08:30.510]  They're adult small terriers.
[08:30.510 --> 08:34.610]  When you get out of the shower, those two terriers love to lick your feet when you are
[08:34.610 --> 08:35.610]  wet.
[08:35.610 --> 08:37.730]  They just want to lick your ankles and your feet when you're wet.
[08:37.730 --> 08:39.850]  Recently, we got another dog.
[08:39.850 --> 08:42.490]  Probably close to a year ago, we got another dog.
[08:42.490 --> 08:45.650]  That dog has learned that he likes to lick feet also.
[08:45.650 --> 08:47.610]  The dog has no idea why he likes to lick feet.
[08:48.450 --> 08:49.450]  He doesn't know what it does.
[08:49.450 --> 08:51.730]  He doesn't know what he's doing, but he knows that every time I get out of the shower, he
[08:51.730 --> 08:54.570]  really wants to come into the bathroom and lick my feet.
[08:54.570 --> 08:57.290]  He learned it from Tika, who guess what?
[08:57.290 --> 09:01.210]  Learned it from the dog that was previous to that one who has since passed away.
[09:01.210 --> 09:03.250]  A dog taught another dog something.
[09:03.250 --> 09:05.250]  Now that dog has taught another dog something.
[09:05.250 --> 09:08.250]  That dog thinks it's a way of life, that something is required.
[09:08.250 --> 09:12.730]  It has absolutely no reason why that is a requirement of its life.
[09:12.730 --> 09:16.650]  I thought it was silly to learn that one dog taught another dog.
[09:16.690 --> 09:18.210]  That dog taught another dog.
[09:18.210 --> 09:19.970]  That third dog has no idea why he's doing it.
[09:19.970 --> 09:22.130]  The first dog probably doesn't either.
[09:22.130 --> 09:23.930]  I was like, that's like people in their grow rooms.
[09:23.930 --> 09:27.570]  People are just doing shit because they saw that dog do it, and then that dog did it.
[09:27.570 --> 09:28.570]  Now guess what?
[09:28.570 --> 09:31.090]  That dog's going to do it too, and they don't even know why.
[09:31.090 --> 09:32.090]  So shout out to the dogs.
[09:32.090 --> 09:34.530]  They definitely inspired that portion of the podcast.
[09:34.530 --> 09:38.430]  Are you being a silly dog, or is there a reason for you to be doing the crazy shit that you're
[09:38.430 --> 09:39.430]  doing in your grow?
[09:39.430 --> 09:42.810]  All right, let's do move forward because that was a fun, silly subject.
[09:42.810 --> 09:44.250]  I really did enjoy that one.
[09:44.250 --> 09:46.610]  All right, now let's jump into my next topic.
[09:46.610 --> 09:50.770]  I was recently at a friend's grow, and they were talking about how they have switched
[09:50.770 --> 09:55.610]  to amended soil, and they're doing a living organic amended soil so that they don't have
[09:55.610 --> 09:57.650]  to feed bottled nutrients.
[09:57.650 --> 10:01.690]  They went on to talk about how their bottled nutrient required them to do too much work.
[10:01.690 --> 10:04.370]  So I just kept listening and let them kind of talk.
[10:04.370 --> 10:10.050]  They revealed to me that they were taking each bottle and filling a container with water
[10:10.050 --> 10:14.770]  and adding the recommended dosage of that nutrient to the five-gallon bucket, mixing
[10:14.770 --> 10:17.450]  it up, pouring that into the plants.
[10:17.450 --> 10:21.450]  Then they would take the next bottle that was recommended, mix that into a five-gallon
[10:21.450 --> 10:24.210]  bucket, and pour some of that into each plant.
[10:24.210 --> 10:29.570]  So this person was under the impression that their base nutrient, the CalMag bottle, the
[10:29.570 --> 10:34.730]  booster bottle, the enzyme bottle, all had to be mixed separately into containers of
[10:34.730 --> 10:37.290]  water then fed to the plants.
[10:37.290 --> 10:40.410]  If you were doing that, that is a lot of extra work.
[10:40.410 --> 10:42.690]  I hope that made sense the way I explained it.
[10:42.690 --> 10:44.650]  There are several bottles in your feed regimen.
[10:44.730 --> 10:46.730]  I don't know which company you chose.
[10:46.730 --> 10:50.370]  Some people are under the impression that each of those bottles needs to be mixed into
[10:50.370 --> 10:52.770]  its own container of water and fed to the plants.
[10:52.770 --> 10:54.330]  That is not the case.
[10:54.330 --> 10:58.930]  Let me teach you how I recommend mixing your bottled nutrients if you do choose to use
[10:58.930 --> 11:00.530]  bottled nutrients.
[11:00.530 --> 11:02.930]  This will work for reverse osmosis water.
[11:02.930 --> 11:04.530]  This will work for tap water.
[11:04.530 --> 11:10.730]  This is just my basic advice and method of how I recommend you mix your bottled nutrients.
[11:10.730 --> 11:12.770]  I'm going to start with a five-gallon bucket here.
[11:12.770 --> 11:17.210]  Just a Lowe's bucket, a Home Depot bucket, whatever five-gallon bucket you've got.
[11:17.210 --> 11:20.170]  That's what I'm going to talk about using for my starting container.
[11:20.170 --> 11:21.970]  So I've got my five-gallon bucket.
[11:21.970 --> 11:25.370]  I fill it about 80 to 90% of the way with water.
[11:25.370 --> 11:26.530]  I need some mixing space.
[11:26.530 --> 11:27.930]  I don't want to spill this shit everywhere.
[11:27.930 --> 11:32.170]  I leave maybe an inch, inch and a half at the top so that I've got some working room.
[11:32.170 --> 11:33.970]  So I fill my bucket with water.
[11:33.970 --> 11:39.290]  Now I add my nutrients one nutrient at a time by the recommended dosage.
[11:39.290 --> 11:40.890]  What you're going to feed it is up to you.
[11:40.890 --> 11:45.610]  I would start off with maybe 50% of the recommended dosage on the bottle, maybe 70%.
[11:45.610 --> 11:48.130]  You probably don't need 100% of what they recommend.
[11:48.130 --> 11:50.050]  You'll really be pushing your plants.
[11:50.050 --> 11:52.690]  That is another podcast we'll talk about at another time.
[11:52.690 --> 11:55.770]  But select your bottles that you are going to feed.
[11:55.770 --> 11:57.610]  Understand how much of each bottle you need to feed.
[11:57.610 --> 11:58.610]  Now I'm just going to stay.
[11:58.610 --> 12:01.050]  We're going to start with one bottle.
[12:01.050 --> 12:02.450]  Measure out how much you're going to use.
[12:02.450 --> 12:04.970]  I'm going to say 10 mils per five-gallon container.
[12:04.970 --> 12:09.650]  So you put your 10 milliliters in your measuring device and you pour that into the five-gallon
[12:09.650 --> 12:10.770]  container.
[12:10.850 --> 12:14.450]  Now you get the next bottle and before you pour any bottle, always shake it.
[12:14.450 --> 12:16.050]  That's something that I should mention.
[12:16.050 --> 12:19.970]  Grab the bottle, shake it, measure it, pour it into your five-gallon container.
[12:19.970 --> 12:23.870]  Now the next bottle, you might want to clean out your measuring container.
[12:23.870 --> 12:24.870]  That's always a good idea.
[12:24.870 --> 12:25.870]  Wipe that out.
[12:25.870 --> 12:27.310]  Give it a quick wipe with a paper towel or a rag.
[12:27.310 --> 12:28.770]  Make that fresh and clean.
[12:28.770 --> 12:30.930]  Grab your next bottle, shake it up.
[12:30.930 --> 12:33.850]  Let's just say we're going to do 10 more milliliters of this product.
[12:33.850 --> 12:35.490]  Measure out 10 milliliters.
[12:35.490 --> 12:36.690]  Close your bottle back up.
[12:36.690 --> 12:39.850]  Pour that 10 milliliters into the same five-gallon bucket.
[12:39.930 --> 12:44.650]  We're going to put all of our products into the same five-gallon bucket of water.
[12:44.650 --> 12:48.890]  I don't know how much water you need to water your entire crop or your room or this run
[12:48.890 --> 12:53.410]  or this light or whatever, but mix up the appropriate amount of water and we can put
[12:53.410 --> 12:56.270]  all of the nutrients into that water at one time.
[12:56.270 --> 12:59.730]  We don't have to mix up separate vessels for every product.
[12:59.730 --> 13:01.530]  That is highly unnecessary.
[13:01.530 --> 13:02.810]  That is a lot of extra work.
[13:02.810 --> 13:05.770]  I realize now that a couple of people were mixing that way.
[13:05.770 --> 13:09.810]  So they were mixing, if there was six bottles in the product lineup, they were mixing six,
[13:09.810 --> 13:14.450]  six buckets of water and then trying to feed a little bit of each bucket to each plant.
[13:14.450 --> 13:15.890]  That's a struggle.
[13:15.890 --> 13:19.050]  That's a lot of extra thinking, carrying, mixing, working.
[13:19.050 --> 13:20.370]  That is a pH-ing.
[13:20.370 --> 13:21.530]  That's a big pain in the ass.
[13:21.530 --> 13:24.490]  So get your bucket, fill it with water.
[13:24.490 --> 13:25.490]  Get your first nutrient.
[13:25.490 --> 13:30.050]  I recommend, and this is just a suggestion or recommendation, I recommend you start with
[13:30.050 --> 13:32.210]  your silicates first.
[13:32.210 --> 13:36.490]  Get your silicate bottle, shake that shit up, measure out the amount that you need,
[13:36.490 --> 13:40.490]  pour it into your five-gallon container and stir it counterclockwise.
[13:40.490 --> 13:41.650]  That's my recommendation.
[13:41.650 --> 13:42.930]  Stir it counterclockwise.
[13:42.930 --> 13:44.210]  Get it a good spin.
[13:44.210 --> 13:46.290]  Make sure it's nice and mixed in there.
[13:46.290 --> 13:49.490]  Then I would use my base nutrient would be next.
[13:49.490 --> 13:53.170]  Clean out my measuring container, find my base nutrient bottle, give it a good solid
[13:53.170 --> 13:55.010]  shake so nothing's at the bottom.
[13:55.010 --> 13:56.690]  It's all mixed up real well.
[13:56.690 --> 14:01.770]  Measure out the amount that I need, probably somewhere between 25 and 50 milliliters, possibly
[14:01.770 --> 14:04.810]  100 milliliters if you're using a Botanicare product.
[14:04.810 --> 14:07.010]  Pour that into your five-gallon container.
[14:07.010 --> 14:08.010]  Your silicates are in there.
[14:08.010 --> 14:10.090]  Now your base nutrients are in there.
[14:10.090 --> 14:12.130]  Once again, give it a stir.
[14:12.130 --> 14:15.330]  Give it a good solid stir so that it's going to keep on stirring so that when we add our
[14:15.330 --> 14:20.730]  next bottle, which I would recommend at this point, will probably be that bottle of CalMag.
[14:20.730 --> 14:22.170]  Clean out your measuring container.
[14:22.170 --> 14:23.410]  Find your bottle of CalMag.
[14:23.410 --> 14:25.050]  Measure out the appropriate amount.
[14:25.050 --> 14:26.050]  Close your bottle back up.
[14:26.050 --> 14:28.210]  Pour that into the five-gallon container.
[14:28.210 --> 14:30.970]  It's still spinning from when you stirred it up real hard a minute ago.
[14:30.970 --> 14:32.550]  Still spinning, so just rely on that spin.
[14:32.550 --> 14:33.550]  Keep it going.
[14:33.750 --> 14:39.110]  Then I would add the boosters, then the enzymes, and then I would do the microbes last.
[14:39.110 --> 14:43.990]  Some people will tell you to pH your water after you add your microbes, and some people
[14:43.990 --> 14:46.910]  will say to pH your water before you add microbes.
[14:46.910 --> 14:49.830]  I've had success with both methods.
[14:49.830 --> 14:51.810]  So get the water stirred up.
[14:51.810 --> 14:56.350]  Add your potassium silicate or your silicate nutrients, then your base nutrients, then
[14:56.350 --> 15:01.710]  all of your add-ins, your CalMag, your bloom boosters, your enzymes, and then I would recommend
[15:01.750 --> 15:07.550]  probably the microbes last, and you can adjust the pH before or after those microbes.
[15:07.550 --> 15:08.990]  Let's talk about that.
[15:08.990 --> 15:11.690]  After you've mixed in all of your nutrients, everything you're going to put in there, give
[15:11.690 --> 15:12.850]  it a good mix.
[15:12.850 --> 15:14.910]  Make sure everything is mixed in really well.
[15:14.910 --> 15:16.630]  Stir it counterclockwise.
[15:16.630 --> 15:20.510]  Then when you're done, give it just a couple of good clockwise stirs to mix everything
[15:20.510 --> 15:22.450]  in real nice there.
[15:22.450 --> 15:25.390]  Then we want to adjust the pH if we need to.
[15:25.390 --> 15:27.910]  This is where I recommend a high-quality pH pen.
[15:27.910 --> 15:31.710]  I use a Bluelab pen and I calibrate it probably every 10 days.
[15:31.710 --> 15:32.870]  I should do it once a week.
[15:32.870 --> 15:36.070]  I hit it about every 10 days, two weeks, to be honest with you.
[15:36.070 --> 15:37.150]  Calibrate the pH pen.
[15:37.150 --> 15:42.030]  Then dunk that pH pen right into your five-gallon bucket of water of your solution is what now
[15:42.030 --> 15:44.950]  that is, and measure the pH of that.
[15:44.950 --> 15:49.890]  We want that pH to be somewhere between 6.2 and 6.5.
[15:49.890 --> 15:51.870]  That is going to be the acceptable range.
[15:51.870 --> 15:53.550]  I like 6.4 myself.
[15:53.550 --> 15:56.790]  I really think 6.4 is a great spot for the pH.
[15:56.790 --> 16:00.710]  The way you're going to change that if it's too high, if you put your pH meter in there
[16:00.710 --> 16:06.310]  and it says anything above 6.5, you need a bottle of pH down and put a couple of drops
[16:06.310 --> 16:09.790]  of pH down, stir it, and measure that pH again.
[16:09.790 --> 16:15.350]  Go slow with the pH up or down products because it only takes a little tiny bit to ruin the
[16:15.350 --> 16:16.350]  entire mix.
[16:16.350 --> 16:19.670]  You can go too high or too low very, very quickly.
[16:19.670 --> 16:25.430]  Also, I recommend you wear gloves and eye protection when you are using the pH up and
[16:25.430 --> 16:27.230]  or pH down products.
[16:27.230 --> 16:28.710]  Also, don't mix those.
[16:28.710 --> 16:32.550]  If you've put too much pH down in there, I wouldn't recommend putting pH up in there
[16:32.550 --> 16:33.830]  to fix that.
[16:33.830 --> 16:38.350]  Only use one of those products at a time that could potentially cause you problems depending
[16:38.350 --> 16:41.190]  on the nutrients that you are using.
[16:41.190 --> 16:42.550]  We have filled our bucket.
[16:42.550 --> 16:44.550]  We have put our potassium silicates in there.
[16:44.550 --> 16:48.950]  We stir it, put our base nudes, give it a stir, CalMag, give it a stir, every other
[16:48.950 --> 16:49.950]  nutrient.
[16:49.950 --> 16:53.510]  Maybe give it a stir between them unless you can rely on that spin action that you've created.
[16:53.590 --> 16:56.990]  There are some people that will put a pump in that bucket just to keep it moving.
[16:56.990 --> 16:57.990]  That's a little excessive.
[16:57.990 --> 17:00.690]  If it's a five-gallon, anything bigger, put a mix pump in there.
[17:00.690 --> 17:02.030]  Get it stirring.
[17:02.030 --> 17:03.030]  Add all your nutrients.
[17:03.030 --> 17:04.870]  Put your microbes in there last.
[17:04.870 --> 17:06.430]  Then let's adjust the pH.
[17:06.430 --> 17:08.470]  Get it somewhere between 6.2 and 6.5.
[17:08.470 --> 17:10.670]  6.4 is the sweet spot, in my opinion.
[17:10.670 --> 17:13.670]  I think nutrients really absorb well at that point.
[17:13.670 --> 17:15.230]  Then adjust your pH.
[17:15.230 --> 17:18.370]  Then something I really find important, write everything down.
[17:18.370 --> 17:19.670]  What did you put in there?
[17:19.670 --> 17:21.230]  Write down every product.
[17:21.230 --> 17:26.390]  Write down the date, the time, every product that you put in, how much of it you put in.
[17:26.390 --> 17:28.310]  Then write down the pH.
[17:28.310 --> 17:31.790]  The next thing I would recommend is measuring the EC or the PPMs.
[17:31.790 --> 17:36.270]  It doesn't matter to me which one you use as long as you pick one and stick with it.
[17:36.270 --> 17:37.730]  That's all that matters.
[17:37.730 --> 17:39.950]  You can get a pen that does EC and pH.
[17:39.950 --> 17:41.870]  It'll change them with the push of a button.
[17:41.870 --> 17:42.870]  Pick one.
[17:42.870 --> 17:43.870]  Go with the EC or the PPMs.
[17:43.870 --> 17:47.190]  I apologize for saying the wrong letter a moment ago.
[17:47.190 --> 17:49.190]  Lots of letters and acronyms in my brain.
[17:49.190 --> 17:51.390]  Pick the EC or the PPMs.
[17:51.390 --> 17:52.390]  Write that down.
[17:52.390 --> 17:57.030]  Every time you mix up a solution, write down the pH and the EC of that solution before
[17:57.030 --> 17:58.550]  you feed it to your plants.
[17:58.550 --> 17:59.550]  Document it.
[17:59.550 --> 18:01.710]  This may help you in the future.
[18:01.710 --> 18:02.750]  We've mixed everything up.
[18:02.750 --> 18:04.110]  We have adjusted our pH.
[18:04.110 --> 18:06.050]  We've written down the EC.
[18:06.050 --> 18:08.590]  Now let's water our plants.
[18:08.590 --> 18:12.870]  If you've got decent-sized plants that are healthy and they've got an established root
[18:12.870 --> 18:17.950]  zone within their pot, I recommend watering your plants till somewhere between 15 and
[18:17.950 --> 18:18.950]  25% runoff.
[18:19.710 --> 18:21.630]  You want water coming out of the bottom of your pots.
[18:21.630 --> 18:26.110]  When you get that runoff coming out of the pots, I recommend collecting some of it and
[18:26.110 --> 18:29.590]  testing the pH and the EC of that runoff.
[18:29.590 --> 18:30.590]  It's real easy.
[18:30.590 --> 18:34.230]  Just stick the two pens in that container and it will show you on the screen the pH
[18:34.230 --> 18:36.410]  is this, the EC is this.
[18:36.410 --> 18:41.350]  At this time, don't stress, worry, or concern yourself with those numbers.
[18:41.350 --> 18:44.390]  Until we see a problem with the plants, those numbers do not matter.
[18:44.390 --> 18:48.150]  Once we see problems with the plants, we can start looking at the numbers of what we put
[18:48.150 --> 18:50.590]  in versus the numbers that came out.
[18:50.590 --> 18:53.510]  If the numbers of the EC is too high, the plants aren't eating.
[18:53.510 --> 18:58.030]  If the pH is too low, we can just adjust and make corrections based on that.
[18:58.030 --> 19:02.930]  But I do not make any changes to the runoff until I see the plants are angry.
[19:02.930 --> 19:04.870]  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
[19:04.870 --> 19:08.790]  We're just going to use these numbers for reference if we do have a problem.
[19:08.790 --> 19:09.790]  This is data.
[19:09.790 --> 19:12.790]  This is fail-safe data for if there is a problem.
[19:12.790 --> 19:16.070]  Don't rely too much on this unless you see issues.
[19:16.070 --> 19:17.470]  So water till you get runoff.
[19:17.790 --> 19:21.470]  Then collect some of that water and measure the EC and the pH and mark that down.
[19:21.470 --> 19:25.710]  Like I said, don't worry about the numbers now, but they're there if we need them in
[19:25.710 --> 19:26.910]  the future.
[19:26.910 --> 19:29.670]  So at this point, you should have everything written down.
[19:29.670 --> 19:34.990]  Every nutrient that you fed it, the amount of that nutrient, the EC and pH, the date,
[19:34.990 --> 19:38.430]  even maybe write down the temperature if that's something that one of your devices will show
[19:38.430 --> 19:39.430]  you.
[19:39.430 --> 19:41.230]  The more data, the better when things go wrong.
[19:41.230 --> 19:44.190]  That way, if things go wrong, we know where things went wrong.
[19:44.190 --> 19:45.790]  We can have an opportunity to fix it.
[19:45.910 --> 19:50.710]  But also, if things go super good, now we can repeat those results next time.
[19:50.710 --> 19:54.270]  You've got a chart, a map of exactly what you fed.
[19:54.270 --> 19:58.510]  Just feed them that next time and hopefully they'll come out just as good, if not better.
[19:58.510 --> 20:02.790]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes, smokers,
[20:02.790 --> 20:06.830]  growers, clone cutters, pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out
[20:06.830 --> 20:11.410]  there, I do want to thank you once again for listening to episode 777 of the Grow From
