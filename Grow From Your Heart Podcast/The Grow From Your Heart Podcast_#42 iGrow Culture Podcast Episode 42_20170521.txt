[00:14.330 --> 00:18.890]  Yeah, what's up ladies and gentlemen? It's time for episode number 42 of the iGrow Culture
[00:18.890 --> 00:23.290]  Podcast. They call me Rasta Jeff. Dude, joining me at the table tonight, we have a brand new
[00:23.290 --> 00:26.010]  guest who's never been on the show. What's up, Tony? How you doing?
[00:26.010 --> 00:27.010]  I'm good. How are you?
[00:27.010 --> 00:30.850]  I am great, bro. I'm going to turn down the music a little bit. We'll talk. Tony is the
[00:30.850 --> 00:35.850]  dude that built my website. He built the iRegenetics website. Tony is responsible for getting the
[00:35.850 --> 00:40.250]  feed up that hosts the iGrow Culture Podcast. So dude, big, huge shout out. You don't get
[00:40.250 --> 00:41.970]  the credit you deserve. Thanks a lot.
[00:41.970 --> 00:42.970]  Yeah.
[00:42.970 --> 00:43.970]  Props for that, man.
[00:43.970 --> 00:48.930]  Gosh, excuse me while I cough out a lung. And as usual, well, not usual, as often, I
[00:48.930 --> 00:51.410]  guess, our good buddy Jesse is back. How you doing, bro?
[00:51.410 --> 00:52.410]  Pretty good.
[00:52.410 --> 00:53.410]  Thanks for coming.
[00:53.410 --> 00:54.410]  How's it going, Podcast Land?
[00:54.410 --> 00:55.410]  Did you guys have a good Thanksgiving?
[00:55.410 --> 00:56.410]  Oh, yeah.
[00:56.410 --> 00:57.410]  Yeah.
[00:57.410 --> 00:59.370]  Oh, yeah. I imagine you did. Tony's got an Italian family, so I could imagine how much
[00:59.370 --> 01:00.370]  you guys ate.
[01:00.370 --> 01:01.370]  Yeah.
[01:01.370 --> 01:05.690]  No headphones for you? Sometimes this thing cuts out, bro. I apologize. It's this headphone
[01:05.690 --> 01:07.130]  jack here. Did it come back?
[01:07.130 --> 01:08.130]  Yeah.
[01:08.130 --> 01:10.930]  Cool, cool. Yeah. Once in a while, it'll just fart out on you. Just give me that same, where
[01:10.930 --> 01:13.050]  the fuck are my headphones signal and we'll correct it.
[01:13.050 --> 01:15.250]  Yeah. I don't have it right now either.
[01:15.250 --> 01:17.570]  Oh, we'll keep going. You back?
[01:17.570 --> 01:18.570]  Yeah.
[01:18.570 --> 01:21.450]  Nice. Cool, cool. How was your Thanksgiving, bro? I almost skipped you.
[01:21.450 --> 01:22.450]  It's pretty good.
[01:22.450 --> 01:23.450]  Good, good.
[01:23.450 --> 01:25.610]  I had the privilege of going to four Thanksgiving dinners.
[01:25.610 --> 01:26.610]  Nice.
[01:26.610 --> 01:27.610]  So, yeah.
[01:27.610 --> 01:31.010]  I had two Thanksgiving dinners, incidentally. Shout out to my Aunt Lisa. She made a huge
[01:31.010 --> 01:34.250]  Thanksgiving dinner for the whole family. That's really super cool of you. I appreciate
[01:34.250 --> 01:40.310]  it. It was tasty. I'm a vegetarian, so she was really nice and made some things differently
[01:40.690 --> 01:44.310]  than she would have. She didn't put beef broth and bacon and some shit, so I had a lot of
[01:44.310 --> 01:49.990]  options to eat. Also, huge shout out to Angela. Angela doesn't have any family here in Colorado,
[01:49.990 --> 01:53.030]  so I totally invited her to come eat dinner with my family and I, and she had a great
[01:53.030 --> 01:54.030]  time.
[01:54.030 --> 01:55.030]  Nice.
[01:55.030 --> 01:56.910]  She was totally cool. My family loved her, so thanks for coming. I really appreciate
[01:56.910 --> 02:01.190]  that, Angela. I hope all the listeners had a good Thanksgiving, or if you're not into
[02:01.190 --> 02:07.070]  that, then I hope you had a great Thursday and a good weekend. Some people hate Thanksgiving.
[02:07.070 --> 02:10.590]  I'm impartial and I go eat with the family to be social like we should.
[02:10.590 --> 02:16.670]  I think it's one of the better holidays. There's a, you know, it's just, well, at its core,
[02:16.670 --> 02:17.670]  it's one of the better holidays.
[02:17.670 --> 02:18.670]  What about 420, bro?
[02:18.670 --> 02:19.670]  Oh, yeah. That's an awesome holiday.
[02:19.670 --> 02:20.670]  That's like Christmas for the potheads.
[02:20.670 --> 02:21.670]  Yeah.
[02:21.670 --> 02:26.550]  All right. Let's see. Do I have any other stuff we got to do? Let's get to some ads
[02:26.550 --> 02:29.910]  real quick so we can get right down to business. On this episode, I do plan on doing a little
[02:29.910 --> 02:35.430]  lesson on nutrients and stuff, and I also have a good question for my buddy, Tony. Tony
[02:35.990 --> 02:39.590]  is a, he's an organic chemistry student. How far are you from your degree, bro?
[02:39.590 --> 02:43.590]  About five, 10 credit hours.
[02:43.590 --> 02:45.910]  Okay. I don't go to college, so what does that mean for humans?
[02:45.910 --> 02:47.910]  A semester.
[02:47.910 --> 02:51.990]  A semester. Cool. Tony's a new father, so he's distracted from school. Congrats on that.
[02:51.990 --> 02:53.990]  Yeah. Congrats.
[02:53.990 --> 02:58.070]  He hasn't been around as much, so I'm sure he's not at school as much.
[02:58.070 --> 03:02.230]  Turn down that music. I'm trying to yell over it. It feels way better. So we'll have Tony
[03:02.230 --> 03:06.390]  talk about a couple things here in a minute. Before we can get that far, this podcast is

[04:51.270 --> 04:55.910]  dude, I've got the coughs from some dabs. This podcast, you're going to cough too? Do it. I'll
[04:55.910 --> 05:00.150]  turn your mic off. Those dabs were killer. Yeah, they were kind of bigger than what we should have
[05:00.150 --> 05:04.070]  taken right before a show. That was heavy duty. We wanted to get it done and get to the show.
[05:04.070 --> 05:07.670]  If you take two dabs that are really big, you just move on. You don't have to sit there and dab
[05:07.670 --> 05:11.750]  out all day. That's what I think. Big love to TreeThugger.com. This episode is brought to you

[05:27.030 --> 05:31.590]  sponsors, dude. We really appreciate you guys helping us out. Also, a big shout out to CootDog
[05:31.590 --> 05:35.670]  and Catherine of the Mystic Roots Band. They let me play all of their music on the podcast. How
[05:35.670 --> 05:40.470]  cool is that? Can't go much cooler than that. I want to give a big shout out to Spence and Maddie.
[05:40.470 --> 05:44.310]  They came over the other night and helped me do a chore. I wish you guys great luck with the secret
[05:44.310 --> 05:48.390]  cup that you're headed to. I hope you guys bring home a trophy and a whole bunch of prizes and a
[05:48.390 --> 05:53.590]  new rig. I want to dab out of your new rig on the podcast next week. That'll be super awesome.
[05:53.590 --> 05:57.590]  And get the respect that you totally deserve and are worthy of.
[05:57.590 --> 06:00.470]  Did you hear that? I didn't say that. I didn't say that. That was my homie,
[06:00.470 --> 06:04.470]  Jesse. I butter him up a lot, but Jesse just said that you guys deserve respect.
[06:04.470 --> 06:07.670]  I agree. Also, a big shout out to Laz. I don't know if you listen to the show,
[06:07.670 --> 06:11.590]  but I met a dude named Laz recently. We finally met in person. We've been online buddies. We got
[06:11.590 --> 06:17.350]  to hang out. Cool ass dude. Shout out. Also, last shout out for a minute. Mr. Omnio. What's up, bro?
[06:17.350 --> 06:20.390]  You're finally caught up on episodes. It's like we're hanging out in his kitchen.
[06:20.390 --> 06:25.830]  He left a tweet that says, I'm listening while I'm making beef bouillon. And it's like they're
[06:25.830 --> 06:30.070]  hanging out in my kitchen. So dude, we record this show about 10 feet from my kitchen. So
[06:30.070 --> 06:33.590]  that could have been a reality almost. You were almost there.
[06:33.590 --> 06:34.870]  Come cook for us. No.
[06:34.870 --> 06:39.590]  Come cook. Yeah. Yeah. Come cook for us. Anybody can come cook for us. I'm a strict vegetarian.
[06:40.150 --> 06:44.950]  Jesse will eat almost anything. Tony, you can anything. All right. Come cook for us, guys. You
[06:44.950 --> 06:50.950]  can be the agriculture chef. All right. I've got a couple of topics written down. One of them,
[06:51.750 --> 06:56.070]  this just came up. I was kind of rude to somebody the other day. I realized that they were selling
[06:57.270 --> 07:03.030]  their plants. Their crop got powdery mildew. And instead of salvaging it, they decided to cut the
[07:03.030 --> 07:07.430]  crop down and make live resin out of it. And I would not have known about it unless somebody else
[07:07.430 --> 07:14.150]  told me that they were doing that. And so I called him out on it. And I said, you are the
[07:14.150 --> 07:18.230]  difference between being a caregiver and a cash cropper. You are the person that's going to make
[07:18.230 --> 07:23.110]  somebody sick because we shouldn't be giving tainted medicine to people who already have
[07:23.110 --> 07:28.710]  a compromised immune system. Other people in the room treated me like I was kind of going overboard.
[07:29.510 --> 07:34.550]  But I felt it was kind of my responsibility to call this dude out and let him know that he's
[07:34.550 --> 07:38.950]  really doing it wrong and he's making us all look bad. He's not helping the movement at all. And
[07:38.950 --> 07:43.270]  that's not what I'm working towards. So I wanted to have a little bit of backup when I approach
[07:43.270 --> 07:47.110]  this dude saying this is why. So that's why I brought Tony on the show. Like I was saying earlier,
[07:47.110 --> 07:51.750]  Tony is an organic chemistry student and he knows a lot about this. So I guess the simple question I
[07:51.750 --> 07:57.910]  want to ask, once again, excuse my dab throat. If we take these powdery mildew buds and we blast
[07:57.910 --> 08:02.790]  them with butane, are we going to get powdery mildew or what is happening? Can you tell me a
[08:02.790 --> 08:07.910]  little about that? Well, you're not going to get the powdery mildew itself, but you'll get the
[08:07.910 --> 08:16.150]  mycotoxins or any sort of toxins that they create, which powdery mildew is fairly toxic to humans.
[08:17.830 --> 08:21.750]  Now, believe it or not, you could actually probably be better off smoking the buds yourself,
[08:22.390 --> 08:27.990]  not distributing them, but it would be less toxic than blasting it and concentrating it.
[08:27.990 --> 08:32.390]  That's why they call them concentrates because we're concentrating everything that's in the plant
[08:32.390 --> 08:39.590]  matter into an oil that is far, far, far more concentrated than the plant matter itself.
[08:40.550 --> 08:45.270]  I hadn't even thought about that route. You're making powdery mildew dabs, just like you are
[08:45.270 --> 08:49.190]  hash. You're taking the mycotoxins and concentrating it. Okay. Sorry, I got to fix
[08:49.190 --> 08:56.550]  that. I got that mic up. I have a question. When you say fairly toxic, could you put some kind of
[08:56.550 --> 09:00.710]  comparison on that? Well, it's definitely not like black mold or anything like that, but
[09:01.030 --> 09:07.270]  I'm sure you guys remember the swag days, all the cheap brick weed. That stuff had powdery mildew
[09:07.270 --> 09:12.870]  in it very often. And even smoking small quantities of that, you'd end up with chest congestion,
[09:12.870 --> 09:18.310]  bronchitis, usually sore throat for a week and a half. So you could imagine what happens if you
[09:18.310 --> 09:24.230]  concentrate it 10 to 15 times the dosage. And then you take a big fat dab like I like to do.
[09:24.230 --> 09:28.630]  Oh yeah. So you just probably got a good percentage of mycotoxins in your body.
[09:29.030 --> 09:33.430]  Yeah. And the trippy thing about that is it's not going to show up immediately. It's probably
[09:33.430 --> 09:38.390]  going to show up in a month or two. The really weird effects, you're probably going to go a
[09:38.390 --> 09:43.910]  little nuts from it. A little bit of psychosis in my mind? Behavior change, yeah. Paranoia.
[09:43.910 --> 09:47.670]  That's if we smoke a lot, right? That's not like from one or two dabs or some PM dabs.
[09:48.230 --> 09:54.230]  It's consistent small doses. So if you're smoking it once a day for a week or two,
[09:55.190 --> 09:59.190]  it's going to do some weird stuff to you. I definitely don't want to do that.
[09:59.190 --> 10:02.070]  It makes you think, guys. Wonder where your dabs are coming from.
[10:03.510 --> 10:07.830]  And he said, this is something that caught my mind. He said, it would be better if you smoke
[10:07.830 --> 10:12.790]  the buds than it would be to smoke the hash. And I also like that you said, smoke the damn buds
[10:12.790 --> 10:17.030]  yourself. Don't give them out to anybody. That's what you should do. If you grew powdery mildew
[10:17.030 --> 10:21.750]  buds and you have to do something, smoke it yourself. That way, reap what you sow. That
[10:21.750 --> 10:25.350]  way you're not getting somebody else sick. If you're going to do it, do it. Don't give it to
[10:25.350 --> 10:30.710]  someone else to smoke. All right. So mycotoxins, you said a little bit of psychosis. Do you think
[10:30.710 --> 10:35.270]  a little bit of headache, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, stuff that would be described as
[10:36.790 --> 10:41.030]  mistaken as other things? Definitely. Usually flu-like or cold symptoms.
[10:41.590 --> 10:47.030]  And then as it gets later, you'll definitely get like typical mold poisoning, like seizures and
[10:47.990 --> 10:54.470]  a very, very, very, very bad things will happen to you. Kidney and liver toxicity.
[10:54.470 --> 10:57.270]  From mycotoxins, right? Oh yeah. Those, those wreak havoc on you.
[10:58.070 --> 11:04.790]  And a powdery mildew is, it's of that type of organism that's going to produce those. And it's,
[11:05.510 --> 11:10.550]  they don't worry about it for food crops very often because it's only leafy parts that get
[11:10.550 --> 11:15.830]  affected by it. Most fruits like tomatoes and stuff won't show the little patches on them.
[11:15.830 --> 11:21.590]  So like cucumbers or squash should always get infected. The fruit itself's probably safe.
[11:22.470 --> 11:27.270]  Yeah. To consume, not to blast into hash, you're probably running into the same trouble.
[11:27.270 --> 11:30.790]  Cucumber resin. And I'm pretty sure. You can get some tarps, bro.
[11:31.830 --> 11:36.790]  Yeah. And even then that's not very strong quantities because you have to have a large
[11:36.790 --> 11:41.990]  amount of leafy matter infected with the white patches. That's the fruiting body.
[11:42.550 --> 11:47.030]  And then it's, it's a toxin that systemic that goes throughout the plant. So yeah,
[11:47.030 --> 11:51.510]  you'll end up with it in your cucumbers or squash or whatever, but not much. However,
[11:51.510 --> 11:57.750]  we're, we're smoking leafy, leafy flowers, which accumulate that stuff with freakishly high
[11:58.310 --> 12:05.430]  concentrations itself. So it's not the same as a food, a food issue. Cause it's, it's technically
[12:05.430 --> 12:10.310]  considered non-toxic for food crops, even though they don't let it ever happen. But you definitely
[12:10.310 --> 12:14.870]  don't want to be smoking that stuff. We've had it on, like you said, the leafy parts of plants,
[12:14.870 --> 12:20.390]  but we've never actually, like I've never actually seen it on the, uh, there you go.
[12:20.390 --> 12:23.670]  You're into the side of the mic, like some kind of gangster rapper. What was that?
[12:23.670 --> 12:33.990]  Punk rocker. Okay. But, uh, I've always, um, you know, since powdery mildew kind of came around
[12:33.990 --> 12:40.870]  last few five, six years, it seems like, um, I've wondered about those late season crops that
[12:40.870 --> 12:47.270]  always get infected with that. Yeah. Yeah. I've tended to throw a lot of that stuff in the compost
[12:47.270 --> 12:51.350]  pile. That's probably what you should do. Well, I don't know. Is that powdery mildew going to
[12:51.350 --> 12:55.110]  affect his compost? Yeah. You don't want to actually put that in compost either. They say,
[12:55.110 --> 13:01.110]  really? Yeah. It's, it's not a good one to have. Okay. Mycotoxin. I figured he got
[13:01.110 --> 13:05.830]  hot enough that it doesn't kill the spores. Okay. And you don't actually have to worry about
[13:05.830 --> 13:10.230]  inhaling the sports. It's that literally the toxins that you're burning are just going to
[13:10.230 --> 13:13.990]  wreak havoc on your, uh, the mucus membranes at first. And then it's going to make you a little
[13:13.990 --> 13:20.470]  weird. I've been, I've seen some, uh, big commercial rooms that I felt like the spores
[13:20.470 --> 13:25.270]  actually burned my nose. I think I know who you're talking about. I think I know who you're
[13:25.270 --> 13:32.230]  talking about. Possibly. So this dude told me that using a one micron screen would prevent any
[13:32.230 --> 13:37.350]  of the, uh, mycotoxins or spores getting into the hash. That's completely bullshit. Cause he's,
[13:37.350 --> 13:42.630]  we're basically juicing the mycotoxins right through that screen. They're in solution. So
[13:42.630 --> 13:49.110]  you can't filter them out as if they were solid particles. Just like the THC is correct. Correct.
[13:49.110 --> 13:53.750]  Yeah. It's totally a same thing as salt and water, unless you're actually have a filter.
[13:53.750 --> 13:58.470]  That's not even a, it's not even a filter anymore. They call it a semi permeable membrane.
[13:58.470 --> 14:04.070]  That's what osmosis uses. Okay. Yeah. That's that's yeah. That's not even a filter anymore.
[14:04.070 --> 14:08.870]  You can't filter a dissolve solid out of a liquid. I like the Tony knows a lot of shit.
[14:09.910 --> 14:14.070]  Yeah. Sorry. It's warm in here. Oh no. It got hot in here today, man. Those tabs got to me.
[14:15.430 --> 14:20.070]  Everyone's a little slow. I can tell on the show. All right. So basically powdery mildew is fucking
[14:20.070 --> 14:24.070]  terrible. You guys, if you've got powdery mildew on your buds, don't give that to somebody else,
[14:24.070 --> 14:28.150]  smoke that yourself. If you're going to do anything with it, don't blast it. Please don't
[14:28.150 --> 14:33.590]  blast it. If you're a medical marijuana provider and you are giving powdery mildew buds to sick
[14:33.590 --> 14:37.830]  people, you're the devil. You are anti the movement. You're doing everything wrong.
[14:37.830 --> 14:41.590]  You're making sick people sicker. You're causing more problems than you're helping.
[14:41.590 --> 14:45.270]  You're the difference between a cash cropper and a caregiver. Don't be a cash cropper,
[14:45.270 --> 14:49.270]  be a caregiver. I'm in, I'm done with that rant. I'll stop. Also, Ryan, if you listen to the
[14:49.270 --> 14:54.230]  podcast, I kind of went off on you kind of hard about this the other day. I apologize. I try to be
[14:54.230 --> 14:58.870]  a leader of the movement and a lot of people will accept that. And I want to speak out about it and
[14:58.870 --> 15:03.830]  make sure that you know how passionately wrong I feel that it is. It might've been rude. I apologize,
[15:03.830 --> 15:08.790]  bro. We're still friends. We'll still dab. All right. So I promised that we would talk about
[15:08.790 --> 15:12.390]  nutrients. You guys all feel good about the powdery mildew topic? Oh yeah. Thanks for your
[15:12.390 --> 15:15.670]  expertise, Tony. Tony will be good at this nutrient part too. Tony's, I'm not going to
[15:15.670 --> 15:19.910]  call him a pro level grower. He's got a couple of few crops under his belt. He he's got that
[15:19.910 --> 15:25.110]  chemistry background, so it really helps him out, but it also kind of kills him. All right, guys,
[15:25.110 --> 15:29.430]  we had to take a quick break, but we are back. Jesse had to dip out. He well, I wish I had a
[15:29.430 --> 15:33.910]  better story for you. He took a dab and turned green. So we had to cut out and get Jesse some
[15:33.910 --> 15:38.150]  water and get him to the couch right now. Jesse is chilling on the couch. He'll be all right.
[15:38.150 --> 15:41.430]  He may come back to the show, but I doubt it. He said, go on without him. So we're going to do that.
[15:42.390 --> 15:45.990]  Um, insert your, make fun of Jesse comments right here. He is a professional, but
[15:45.990 --> 15:50.150]  sometimes a dab will get you. So he's chilling. Um, let's do him some love by this way. This
[15:50.150 --> 15:53.350]  podcast is brought to you by our good friends at high-growth indoor growing supplies. High-growth
[15:53.350 --> 15:58.950]  indoor growing supplies has two locations to serve Colorado. Visit the Denver store on 6271 beach
[15:58.950 --> 16:04.470]  street, or check out the beautiful Pueblo location on 618 East fourth street in Pueblo, Colorado.
[16:05.190 --> 16:09.590]  Check out high-growth for competitive pricing and a great selection of indoor growth supplies.
[16:09.670 --> 16:13.270]  A high-growth is running a special for the podcast listeners. When you check out at high-growth,
[16:13.270 --> 16:17.350]  tell them you listened to the I grow culture podcast, and they will give you commercial pricing
[16:17.350 --> 16:20.950]  on your entire purchase. Tony, you can do that too. Tell them I listened to the
[16:20.950 --> 16:24.950]  I grow culture podcast and they'll give you commercial pricing, bro. Sweet. That is pretty
[16:24.950 --> 16:30.790]  sweet. Uh, I got a $25 bag of dirt for 17 bucks the other day. So imagine if I was buying something
[16:30.790 --> 16:36.230]  big, also a huge shout out to high-growth indoor growing supplies for hooking me up with a brand
[16:36.230 --> 16:41.990]  new Nano Lux light to test big shout out to Nano Lux lighting. Uh, I can't run it till January
[16:41.990 --> 16:45.270]  because my rooms are full, but I really look forward to running that light. It's one of the
[16:45.270 --> 16:49.350]  dual ended light bulbs. Uh, I'm sure it's going to put out some lumens. It's going to make my room
[16:49.350 --> 16:53.510]  bright. It's gonna make my plants happy. Jesse was giving him praise earlier. Uh, he said he set up
[16:53.510 --> 16:57.990]  one light with a room that had an uneven canopy, uh, because a lot of times your middle plants will
[16:57.990 --> 17:01.670]  grow better because that's where all the lighting is. Uh, he said they evened out within a week or
[17:01.670 --> 17:06.870]  two. So it must be doing something right. All right. I said, we're going to talk about doing,
[17:06.870 --> 17:12.790]  uh, nutrients. And it was also mentioning that, uh, Tony is a chemistry and organic, uh, chemistry
[17:12.790 --> 17:17.670]  major. Uh, he's a physics nerd. He's a computer nerd, but this dude knows a lot of stuff. I think
[17:17.670 --> 17:22.710]  that his knowledge of science really helps him when he grows, but I also think it almost kills
[17:22.710 --> 17:28.150]  him when he grows. Uh, yeah. Plants are predictable, but plants aren't science. Their nature,
[17:28.150 --> 17:33.110]  they have limits. Yeah. So I see Tony, he's like, I fed them potassium. Why aren't they potassiuming?
[17:33.110 --> 17:36.630]  Come on, do it. And I'm like, you got to go to bed and you got to wait like three days and you
[17:36.630 --> 17:40.630]  got to come back and check. And then maybe you'll see what you did. And he's like, I want it now.
[17:40.630 --> 17:45.670]  He thinks he should mix shit up and see explosions for the way plants work. Sometimes it works.
[17:45.670 --> 17:50.630]  Sometimes it does, but it's funny watching you be baffled. I know how much you know about science
[17:50.630 --> 17:55.670]  and organics and to see you look at me like, dude, how come? And it's just the smallest thing that
[17:55.670 --> 17:59.270]  you overlooked. It's, it's great seeing you learn like that, but sometimes it does slow you down.
[17:59.270 --> 18:02.550]  Sometimes it totally shoots you in the foot because you don't believe that the plants will do what I
[18:02.550 --> 18:08.630]  think they should do on their own. Yeah. You want everything to be the incredible Hulk on steroids,
[18:08.630 --> 18:12.790]  on steroids. Rawr. All right. So we're going to talk a little bit about nutrients. I was hoping
[18:12.790 --> 18:16.630]  Jesse would be here because he really has a lot of cool shit to contribute, but I will cover,
[18:16.630 --> 18:21.590]  I will try to, I'll go like, I'll put my voice really deep. I'll turn up the lows on the microphone.
[18:21.590 --> 18:24.950]  So maybe we didn't know they didn't know, but I'll turn up my voice real deep and I'll do Jesse's
[18:24.950 --> 18:29.750]  parts. Most of what we're going to cover will today will be based on bottled nutrients. I think
[18:29.750 --> 18:34.550]  it's a lot easier for a new home grower to learn with a good line of bottled nudes. Next week,
[18:34.550 --> 18:37.990]  I'm going to have a guy named Sean over, you know what? It may be two weeks until I have Sean over.
[18:37.990 --> 18:41.270]  We got to see what happens with the secret cup. No, I should, Sean will be here next week. Maybe
[18:41.270 --> 18:45.350]  Spence will be here the week after with the secret cup victory. That's what I'm hoping for.
[18:45.350 --> 18:49.990]  Sean's going to teach us about organics and sustainable horticulture. Sean doesn't use,
[18:49.990 --> 18:55.270]  to the best of my knowledge, Sean doesn't use any hydro store products. But for today's lesson,
[18:55.270 --> 18:59.430]  we're going to focus on basics. Bottled nutrients are usually reliable and consistent.
[19:00.150 --> 19:03.350]  Our good friend Adam, who couldn't be here tonight, he specifically asked me
[19:03.350 --> 19:07.590]  what he needs to be feeding his plants. And he also asked what the numbers on the front of the
[19:07.590 --> 19:11.670]  bottles mean. So I think the numbers on the front of the bottle is a good question and it's a super
[19:11.670 --> 19:15.750]  good spot to start. So we'll talk about that. There are three numbers. If you go to the hydro
[19:15.750 --> 19:19.590]  shop and you pick up almost any fertilizer bottle, there are three numbers on the front.
[19:20.310 --> 19:25.670]  The first number represents nitrogen. The second number represents phosphorus. And the third number
[19:25.670 --> 19:32.070]  represents potassium. That's NPK. Those are known as macro nutrients. So a bottle of basic grow
[19:32.070 --> 19:38.390]  nutrients, like if you grab Botanicare Pure Blend Pro, or maybe some advanced nutrients, Jungle Juice
[19:38.390 --> 19:44.550]  Grow, the numbers on there are going to be like 325 or 216 or something like that. Each brand's
[19:44.550 --> 19:50.230]  going to be different. So if it says 325, that's what we're going to work with now, it's 325. It
[19:50.230 --> 19:58.630]  means there's 3% nitrogen, 2% phosphorus, and 5% potassium in that bottle. So the numbers on those
[19:58.630 --> 20:03.270]  bottles tell us the NPK values of what the NPK values are of the fertilizers we're buying. But
[20:03.270 --> 20:08.950]  it's up to us to figure out which bottles to use and when to use them and how much to use.
[20:08.950 --> 20:12.870]  Most of the nutrient companies make a really cool nutrient calculator that you can get at the hydro
[20:12.870 --> 20:16.790]  shop. A lot of times it's in a little insert thing, like a coupon right next to the brand. Get those.
[20:16.790 --> 20:21.910]  Those are always super helpful. A lot of times Tony will be like, how much of this nutrient do I use?
[20:21.910 --> 20:25.590]  And since I'm kind of a nerd, I've happened to have a bunch of those little inserts laying around
[20:25.590 --> 20:31.110]  and I'll just pull it out and be like, it says this. But I definitely recommend reducing the
[20:31.110 --> 20:36.310]  recommended dosage to about half of what they say you use. Sometimes two thirds. You can tell. We'll
[20:36.310 --> 20:43.270]  talk more about that. I wrote that part down. So most of the companies make a chart or also online.
[20:43.270 --> 20:48.630]  You can go online to botanicare.com or advancednutrients.com. I know they have super great
[20:48.630 --> 20:53.110]  feeding schedule calculators. If you use a pre-developed recipe from there, they'll tell
[20:53.110 --> 20:57.910]  you exactly what to use every week. I suggest you reduce the dosage, like I was saying, to about half.
[20:57.910 --> 21:01.670]  Those companies, they want to sell you more. They really want you to buy more shit. So they tell you
[21:01.910 --> 21:08.070]  use a little bit extra, like five or 10 milliliters every week adds up to them and to you, but you
[21:08.070 --> 21:12.470]  don't notice it. Your plants won't notice it. So they kind of overfeed your plants on purpose.
[21:13.030 --> 21:18.070]  So reduce what they say. If you see signs of a deficiency, you can increase your fertilizer on
[21:18.070 --> 21:24.870]  the next feed, but you can't, if you overfeed, you can't correct that. You've got burnt leaves
[21:24.870 --> 21:29.350]  and angry roots and your plants look all fucking fried out. I think I've seen a couple of your
[21:29.350 --> 21:34.870]  plants do that one time. Oh yeah. Yeah. Tony's not afraid to mess with some plants. Tony is all
[21:34.870 --> 21:39.670]  about getting in there and torturing the shit out of his crop. Yeah. So usually pH burns.
[21:39.670 --> 21:43.510]  I was going to talk a lot about pH burns. If we have time, I'm going to try to go about 45 to an
[21:43.510 --> 21:48.950]  hour here, but if we have time for pH, we'll get into it. Something I recommend, and this is,
[21:48.950 --> 21:52.550]  this is part of what I think Tony shoots himself in the foot with. I recommend that if you're going
[21:52.550 --> 21:56.630]  to use a brand of bottled nutrients, you stick with the brand until you become experienced and
[21:56.630 --> 22:01.430]  you can identify deficiencies and problems, which means a few things. First, if you use Botanicare
[22:01.430 --> 22:07.030]  Pure Blend Pro as a base, I totally recommend using whatever Botanicare Pure Blend Pro additives you
[22:07.030 --> 22:11.990]  can afford to add, but don't mix stuff from other brands. I know that sounds ridiculous,
[22:11.990 --> 22:16.790]  like brand loyalty or a sales pitch, but I think it's rational with any brand and I'll explain why.
[22:16.790 --> 22:22.710]  I don't mix brands because of, and Tony will like this, chelation, buffers, and bonding agents versus
[22:22.710 --> 22:28.310]  organics. A lot of products have chemicals that make the products last longer. Some have chemicals
[22:28.310 --> 22:31.670]  that prevent certain compounds from bonding inside the bottle and ruining the solution,
[22:32.230 --> 22:36.710]  and many of those chemicals will ruin all of the beneficial compounds in an organic solution.
[22:37.510 --> 22:42.550]  Tony may correct me on this. I feel like if I poured some synthetic nutrient, like if I got
[22:42.550 --> 22:47.430]  almost anything from advanced nutrients, if I poured Big Bud into a batch of organic compost tea,
[22:47.430 --> 22:51.910]  I think the Big Bud would kill most of the bioactivity in my compost tea. Is that correct?
[22:52.710 --> 22:57.750]  I think Big Bud, especially like Overdrive definitely would wreak havoc.
[22:57.750 --> 23:01.030]  Okay. How about my Mycos? Is it just going to destroy my Myco life?
[23:01.030 --> 23:06.790]  Destroy your Mycos and actually it's probably going to bring things out of solution,
[23:07.670 --> 23:13.990]  like calcium compounds. And those, once they're unavailable to the plant, they actually
[23:13.990 --> 23:18.070]  create other deficiencies. It's all about balance apparently.
[23:18.070 --> 23:23.110]  All right. You definitely enforced what I was trying to say. I sound like I know what I'm
[23:23.110 --> 23:27.910]  talking about now. All right. So unless you're sure the product gets along with other products,
[23:27.910 --> 23:32.070]  you shouldn't be adding two things from different brands because you could cause problems. You could
[23:32.070 --> 23:36.790]  have everything going for the first six weeks, and then you go and add in some Bud Booster that
[23:36.790 --> 23:41.510]  doesn't match up with your schedule, and it could totally just ruin all the work you've done for the
[23:41.510 --> 23:47.830]  past veg time plus six weeks of flower. So another reason I stick with one brand is because as you
[23:47.830 --> 23:51.990]  learn, you need something to be consistent. As many things as you can need to be consistent.
[23:51.990 --> 23:56.310]  It's hard to adapt to changes and identify problems with too many variables. I feel like
[23:56.310 --> 24:00.950]  if we minimize the variables, we can dial in our crops to perfection. If you're not truly happy with
[24:00.950 --> 24:05.030]  your nutrients, you can for sure switch them, but I recommend trying the same brand while you learn.
[24:05.030 --> 24:09.590]  I know I keep talking about it, but I personally, I like Botanicare. I've used advanced nutrients.
[24:09.590 --> 24:14.950]  I felt like with advanced, I got huge buds and everything finished really quickly, but
[24:14.950 --> 24:19.670]  I also feel like everything looked and smelled and tasted the same. I don't think there was
[24:19.670 --> 24:25.430]  much variation. If I ran OG Kush, Sour Diesel, Strawberry Haze, they all kind of had the same
[24:25.430 --> 24:31.110]  advanced nutrients. They all smelled like Nirvana. Oh yeah. And advanced, it's actually kind of like
[24:31.110 --> 24:37.190]  junk food. It's the wrong kind of nitrogen that you'd want for healthy plants. They look nice,
[24:37.190 --> 24:41.670]  but they're not actually as healthy as they should be. Okay. I didn't ever think of that.
[24:42.550 --> 24:46.550]  All I could tell is that they were taken off. For what I paid, I could tell I was getting my
[24:46.550 --> 24:50.630]  money's worth. I was getting that extra that they advertise, but I didn't like the flavor.
[24:50.630 --> 24:54.310]  And when you're growing crops for yourself, I want the flavor. I want the flavor I want.
[24:54.870 --> 24:59.350]  I grew with Syco. I did a couple of rounds with Syco. They actually gave me a free box set,
[24:59.350 --> 25:04.470]  and I ran it side by side next to Botanicare. I have a five by five hut next to a five by five
[25:04.470 --> 25:09.670]  hut. Everything is the same. It's in the same room. I did Syco on one side, Botanicare on the other.
[25:09.670 --> 25:14.630]  The Syco side, everything turned really, really purple, and it was sexy. It was a really photogenic
[25:14.630 --> 25:20.470]  bud. Once again, I didn't like the flavor. Oh yeah. It didn't burn as well, and it had a funky flavor.
[25:20.470 --> 25:26.310]  I used Sol Synthetics from Aurora, excuse me, from Aurora Innovations, and it has a lot of
[25:26.310 --> 25:31.750]  molasses-y type stuff, a lot of humic stuff, and that made for tasty, tasty buds. But it didn't
[25:31.750 --> 25:35.270]  give me enough harvest, and it didn't get real resiny. It tasted super good, but I didn't get
[25:35.270 --> 25:40.390]  the harvest I wanted. Humboldt Nutrients, that stuff worked well, but there's a lot of PGRs and
[25:40.390 --> 25:45.430]  things I'm trying to get away from in there, just like Advanced Nutrients. I don't want to use a lot
[25:45.430 --> 25:50.710]  of PGRs and things like that. Humboldt did well, but again, I prefer Botanicare for the flavor.
[25:50.710 --> 25:57.110]  That's what I like the best. It's all about tea. Yeah. Now it's getting to be all about the teas.
[25:57.110 --> 26:01.750]  The guy that's coming on next week is all about making super awesome teas. So for my personal,
[26:01.750 --> 26:06.150]  I'll always probably go back to the Botanicare Pure Blend Pro with all the additives recommended.
[26:06.150 --> 26:12.790]  I also use SeaPlex from the Organicare lineup, and I'll add some kind of molasses and yucca extract
[26:12.790 --> 26:16.630]  and maybe some dehydrated coconut water to my feeding toward the middle of bloom,
[26:16.630 --> 26:19.830]  but that's our secret. So don't ever say that on a podcast where people could hear you.
[26:19.830 --> 26:26.150]  It's actually good for beginner growers to pile on the yucca, your air tolerance for temperatures
[26:26.150 --> 26:31.430]  and a bunch of things. Yeah. It's very good for you. It's kind of like aloe vera on a sunburn,
[26:31.430 --> 26:35.510]  except inside. I know that sounds weird, but it definitely works to moisten things up and keep
[26:35.510 --> 26:40.150]  things safe. A good source of yucca extract. If you don't want to just go find yucca extract and
[26:40.150 --> 26:44.630]  figure out how to use that, Humboldt Honey is actually packed with yucca extract and it's a
[26:44.630 --> 26:48.470]  great product. You need something with molasses and sugars in it anyway, late in bloom.
[26:49.030 --> 26:54.710]  So that's what I would recommend. If anybody from Botanicare is listening, you can send me an email
[26:54.710 --> 26:58.550]  and I'll get you my shipping address and sponsorship info. I read genetics on Instagram.
[26:58.550 --> 27:03.510]  Check out my feed. Yeah. Botanicare. I buy a lot of your stuff, guys. Talk to me. Hello.
[27:04.790 --> 27:08.070]  Another reason I would stick to one brand is because doubling up on nutrient brands,
[27:08.790 --> 27:12.790]  you could actually double up on something you don't want. You could have overlap. There could
[27:12.790 --> 27:19.590]  be too much magnesium in this one or too much, I don't know, molybdenum in this one. And you don't
[27:19.590 --> 27:23.670]  realize it because they don't list all that small stuff on every bottle. So if you use something
[27:23.670 --> 27:28.230]  from Botanicare, something from Advanced Nutrients, you may possibly be overdosing your
[27:28.230 --> 27:36.950]  plant with something. And so Botanicare is not going to make a nutrient A with nutrient B that
[27:36.950 --> 27:41.830]  would overlap. And they kind of wouldn't do that. They know that that's in there. Sorry, guys,
[27:41.830 --> 27:45.670]  my throat's all clogged up from taking those dabs that killed Jesse. Now I should say that
[27:45.670 --> 27:53.350]  most of the nutrient companies make their own mycoproducts. Those you can go a little outside
[27:53.350 --> 28:00.550]  the line for. Oh, yeah, absolutely. As well as there's a few other things like enzymes. Yes.
[28:00.550 --> 28:06.950]  Enzymes, mycos. For enzymes, I always recommend the Hygrozyme. And for mycos lately, all the OGT
[28:06.950 --> 28:12.550]  products are freaking awesome. And I also like Great White Shark myself. I put those in almost
[28:12.550 --> 28:16.470]  every plant. If you want to go the Advanced Nutrients route and you want to spend a lot of
[28:16.470 --> 28:23.110]  money, that Piranha and Tarantula in the liquid bottles, it's $183.50 per bottle. But like 10
[28:23.110 --> 28:28.070]  or 20 mils will give you explosive roots. Put that shit in your cloner. If you've got an easy
[28:28.070 --> 28:32.150]  cloner, your roots will push the lid off the cloner. Your plants will get up and walk away.
[28:32.150 --> 28:33.190]  Wow.
[28:33.190 --> 28:36.950]  Yeah. So once you guys get comfortable and have a good understanding of your feeding routine,
[28:36.950 --> 28:41.910]  you can add whatever you feel like you need. Just read the bottles, adjust your PPMs accordingly,
[28:41.910 --> 28:48.070]  and pay attention to what you're feeding the plants. Just read the labels. Read them. Go to
[28:48.070 --> 28:51.830]  the website. Find out what's in those products. They should be readily available. If a company
[28:51.830 --> 28:54.870]  doesn't want to tell you what's in their stuff, I don't want to use it is kind of how I feel
[28:54.870 --> 28:59.830]  anyway. I wrote down a side note talking about PPMs. A friend of mine was having problems with
[28:59.830 --> 29:06.070]  this crop. His leaves were curling up, looking like goofy fingers. I thought it was a light
[29:06.070 --> 29:10.790]  leak during the dark cycle. He thought it was the genetics. Everybody was real confused. Sorry,
[29:10.790 --> 29:15.830]  I just burped right into the microphone. Everybody was real confused, but the room was correct. He
[29:15.830 --> 29:20.070]  had good genetics. And after a few days, we realized a problem. His magnetic ballasts were
[29:20.070 --> 29:25.750]  causing interference with the PPM and pH meter, and everything was way off. He's thinking he's
[29:25.750 --> 29:31.510]  balancing out the pH perfectly, six, five, seven, and he's actually making it 11 or lower. He's
[29:31.510 --> 29:35.030]  probably going down. It's probably like four because that low is probably what made everything
[29:35.030 --> 29:43.110]  curl. He's getting it real low. What I was going to say is try to get away from your magnetic
[29:43.110 --> 29:48.150]  ballasts so that when you take readings, your magnetic ballasts aren't making everything jump
[29:48.150 --> 29:52.150]  up and down. Also, take good care of your PPM and pH meters. People overlook those,
[29:52.150 --> 29:56.950]  and they're super important. Jesse recommended making the cords as short as possible in your
[29:56.950 --> 30:02.390]  grow rooms. That would definitely help with stuff like having your PPM meter fluctuate so heavily.
[30:03.670 --> 30:06.470]  It'll take a couple of weeks, but his plants will be back on track. He's just a couple of
[30:06.470 --> 30:10.310]  weeks behind. They'll look good. All right, so we're talking about nutrients. That was a side
[30:10.310 --> 30:14.550]  note I wanted to make sure to get out. Our main goal here with nutrients is to have the correct
[30:14.550 --> 30:18.870]  amount of nutrients at the right time to keep the plants at peak performance without ever
[30:18.870 --> 30:23.750]  overfeeding them and causing nutrient burn or lockouts. Also, I wrote down, don't forget to
[30:23.750 --> 30:28.710]  pay attention to your pH. Also, I said when you see problems that look like deficiencies,
[30:28.710 --> 30:32.150]  they are often from a pH issue that was overlooked. If you're going to push your
[30:32.150 --> 30:38.470]  plants to perform, you need to have the proper pH. I think 6.5 to 7 is ideal for most cannabis
[30:38.470 --> 30:42.550]  strains. You're going to have to adjust to your room, your environment, and your strain.
[30:43.430 --> 30:49.110]  The coco fiber people, they have a different range. Then the regular deep water culture
[30:49.110 --> 30:54.230]  hydro people, I think they want it down in the 5.5s. Yeah, that sounds about right. Most of what
[30:54.230 --> 30:58.550]  I talk about is soil. Sorry, guys. I'm a soil-less kind of guy. Most everything I do is in soil-less
[30:58.550 --> 31:03.030]  mix, indoors, under 1,000 watt lights. You'll have to adjust. Like I'm saying, everything is
[31:03.030 --> 31:09.350]  about adapting. All right, good call. Right on for reminding those people or me. During the veg
[31:09.350 --> 31:14.470]  phase, your plants are going to want high levels of nitrogen. As the plants progress into the
[31:14.470 --> 31:17.830]  flowering stage, they're going to require much less nitrogen, and they're going to want more
[31:17.830 --> 31:22.790]  phosphorus and potassium. We're going to shift into explaining the nutrients and their functions,
[31:22.790 --> 31:26.870]  which is cool that Tony's here for this one because he knows a lot. You hear us talk about
[31:26.870 --> 31:31.910]  NPK. We'll focus on nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. We'll go with nitrogen first. You'll
[31:31.910 --> 31:36.150]  almost always hear nitrogen first. Most of what you breathe is nitrogen. It's an odorless,
[31:36.150 --> 31:42.070]  colorless gas that constitutes over 75% of the Earth's atmosphere. Despite the overwhelming
[31:42.070 --> 31:47.350]  presence of atmospheric nitrogen, there are only a few kinds of plants in the legume family that can
[31:47.350 --> 31:52.630]  make use of it. Marijuana is not a legume. Oh, it should say cannabis. Geez, I cut and pasted this
[31:52.630 --> 31:55.830]  from the internet. I'll give them credit in a minute. I just don't want to break away from my
[31:55.830 --> 32:01.270]  focus here. Where is the website that I stole this from? Yeah, I don't want to stumble around
[32:01.270 --> 32:04.950]  and do too many things. I'm messing with the computer and getting distracted. Marijuana is
[32:04.950 --> 32:10.310]  not a legume, so nitrogen must be supplemented. Synthetically produced nitrogen fertilizer is made
[32:10.310 --> 32:15.190]  in the form of anhydrous ammonia from natural gas. Yeah, that's what I said, anhydrous ammonia from
[32:15.190 --> 32:20.630]  natural gas. Anhydrous ammonia is then usually converted into ammonium nitrate for storage
[32:20.630 --> 32:25.750]  and ease of application. Once granulated, the ammonium nitrate is ready for use as cost-effective
[32:25.750 --> 32:31.030]  and easy-to-use plant food. Natural sources of nitrogen are numerous and include blood meal,
[32:31.030 --> 32:36.230]  manure, bird and bat guano, among many others. All right, guys, Sean will be here next week. I'm
[32:36.230 --> 32:39.830]  going to jump in for a minute. He'll be here next week to discuss this all-organic method.
[32:40.470 --> 32:44.550]  Now, he calls it organic as fuck. Once you hear about your nutrients being fed, being made with
[32:44.550 --> 32:48.790]  anhydrous ammonia, it kind of makes you start getting more interested in that sustainable
[32:48.790 --> 32:53.670]  horticulture stuff, right? Well, it sounds kind of weird and extreme, like some crazy chemistry,
[32:53.670 --> 33:00.950]  but it actually happens in the soil itself. There's a little cycle that nitrates ammonium,
[33:01.670 --> 33:10.950]  and actually pure NH3 ammonia are converted back and forth by your micos. Sometimes you'll buy a
[33:10.950 --> 33:17.990]  pack of micos, it'll say nitrogen fixing. That's what they're talking about. They convert nitrates
[33:17.990 --> 33:24.230]  usually into the ammoniums. So it happens in the soil anyway, but that's actually what makes
[33:24.230 --> 33:29.910]  advanced nutrients junk food. It's all nitrates. You want to have some ammonium ions in there too.
[33:30.550 --> 33:38.710]  Wow. And they actually do exist in the composted organic stuff. They're just produced usually by
[33:39.350 --> 33:46.950]  bacteria, aerobic decay. So Tony's got access to all of the ingredient lists and studies from the
[33:46.950 --> 33:51.190]  colleges because he's a college kid. And he's read some great shit and told me some great
[33:51.190 --> 33:56.630]  things about nutrients, and it's that stuff right there that's golden. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So
[33:57.190 --> 34:01.270]  where was I? I'm talking about Sean's coming. Dude, once I read about this stuff, I got kind of
[34:01.270 --> 34:05.990]  like, I want to go more toward a sustainable way of growing my plants. I think it would be better.
[34:05.990 --> 34:11.590]  That's my next step. I can grow, I can breed, I can select phenotypes. I can identify problems.
[34:11.590 --> 34:17.110]  Everything in my game is strong. Now I just got to adjust and get more eco-friendly, quit using so
[34:17.110 --> 34:22.950]  much electricity and hydro shop stuff. Much love to my hydro shop sponsor. I just got to get away
[34:22.950 --> 34:27.990]  from some of that stuff. So because I was talking about nitrogen, because of its crucial role in
[34:27.990 --> 34:31.990]  photosynthesis, fertilizers high in nitrogen are used during the vegetative phase of growing
[34:31.990 --> 34:36.950]  cannabis. Nitrogen is key to both chlorophyll and protein production and used throughout
[34:36.950 --> 34:43.190]  photosynthesis for the conversion of carbon into sugars and other organic compounds. So grow
[34:43.190 --> 34:47.670]  fertilizers are high in nitrogen. They're used for rapid growth. They're used to build chlorophyll
[34:47.670 --> 34:53.430]  and promote a healthy green color and they improve the volume and health of plant foliage.
[34:54.070 --> 34:58.150]  You guys, if you see your plants looking pale and yellow, that's your first sign of probably a
[34:58.150 --> 35:04.630]  nitrogen deficiency. Oh yeah. We're 35 minutes in. We'll get through these nutrients at least.
[35:04.630 --> 35:10.630]  This will be cool. Yeah. I should say that the plants, most plants in general will intake
[35:11.750 --> 35:16.790]  80% of all of the nitrogen they use in a lifetime during the vegetative stage.
[35:17.670 --> 35:22.950]  So that's why all your vegetative cannabis nutrients have a higher nitrogen value than
[35:22.950 --> 35:26.390]  the flowering ones. Then you cut that out right at the start of flowering? It stores it up
[35:27.110 --> 35:31.830]  for metabolic processes. Okay. So it just saves, just chilling in there. Yeah. Just saved. Part of
[35:31.830 --> 35:37.350]  carbohydrates actually. Okay. It stores it up as energy and then releases it during flower.
[35:37.350 --> 35:44.470]  So I usually feed my veg nutrients until about two weeks into flower so that I'm giving them
[35:44.470 --> 35:49.830]  more nitrogen to have available. Should I just switch right away? That's what I've been doing,
[35:49.830 --> 35:54.230]  but mine turned yellow way too fast. All right. Then I'll just keep feeding that next,
[35:54.230 --> 35:59.270]  that extra two weeks kind of seems to keep them green for the time that I need. Now there's like
[35:59.270 --> 36:06.070]  veganic sources of plant nitrogens, usually amino acids. Those usually, they direct you to use those
[36:06.630 --> 36:12.870]  up to flush, which I've not figured out why, but it's the good nitrogen.
[36:14.950 --> 36:19.190]  Veganics is way different. I've grown a veganic crop with some veganic nutrients I was given and
[36:19.190 --> 36:24.390]  it had the flavor. It definitely had serious flavor. Well, even if you use a cotton seed or soybean meal,
[36:24.950 --> 36:31.350]  those are very high in weird organic types of nitrogens, usually amino acids and proteins.
[36:31.350 --> 36:34.950]  That's why all these organic guys are getting great results. They're using actually naturally
[36:34.950 --> 36:41.430]  occurring nitrogen sources. But you have to have a high, highly active microsphere there.
[36:41.430 --> 36:47.110]  Lots of bacterias and rhizomes. So you have to be using- I can't wait for Sean to come.
[36:47.110 --> 36:49.990]  Listen to the next episode with Sean. You'll love it. You'll love it. All right. Let's talk a little
[36:49.990 --> 36:54.950]  bit about phosphorus. Phosphorus is a volatile and reactive element, which is why it is probably
[36:54.950 --> 37:00.710]  never found in its pure elemental form in nature. Because of its volatility, fertilizer packaging is
[37:00.710 --> 37:08.070]  actually showing a measure of its oxide, P205. Phosphorus is commonly refined from stone called
[37:08.070 --> 37:14.390]  phosphatite or mined from guano islands comprised of primarily bird and bat droppings. A common
[37:14.390 --> 37:19.750]  biomass of source of phosphorus is found in the ground bone, also known as bone meal.
[37:20.630 --> 37:24.310]  Cannabis plants use the phosphorus throughout their growing cycles, but at elevated levels
[37:24.310 --> 37:28.150]  when flowering. As the plant's nutrient requirements change, the feeding schedule is
[37:28.150 --> 37:33.350]  adjusted to include bloom foods with higher levels of phosphorus and lower levels of nitrogen.
[37:33.350 --> 37:37.910]  Because plants also use phosphorus in root formation, low doses of it are often found in
[37:37.910 --> 37:44.550]  cloning solutions. So phosphorus basically, bloom foods are higher in phosphorus. Phosphorus
[37:44.550 --> 37:50.790]  improves bud production. Phosphorus aids in root development and it's involved in oil and glucose
[37:50.790 --> 37:55.910]  production in the end of your blooming cycle. Yeah. You're actually, you want your highest
[37:55.910 --> 38:02.550]  phosphorus levels a few weeks before flower and like for the first third of flower.
[38:02.550 --> 38:10.470]  Okay. So boost those up just like we did with the nitrogen? Yeah. The nitrogen starts to drop down
[38:10.470 --> 38:15.990]  and that's when the phosphorus goes up and then towards the middle end of flower, you want lots
[38:15.990 --> 38:22.470]  and lots of K. So you want a very, very high last number. K. All right. Let's talk about K. Potassium.
[38:23.190 --> 38:28.550]  Potassium is an alkali metal that reacts violently with water and oxidizes quite rapidly when exposed
[38:28.550 --> 38:33.670]  to air. This unstable nature requires that it be added to fertilizers in the form of potassium
[38:33.670 --> 38:40.470]  compounds known as potash. Not all forms of potash are suitable for plants. Like phosphorus, potassium
[38:40.470 --> 38:47.750]  is mined from mineral laden ore. Like N and P, potassium, which is K, is a key component in the
[38:47.750 --> 38:52.870]  metabolic functions of plants and plays a large role in the production of proteins and photosynthesis.
[38:52.870 --> 38:57.270]  Potassium also helps strengthen the marijuana plant's immune system. I'm going to correct that,
[38:57.270 --> 39:01.830]  cannabis plant's immune system, which helps the plants cope with environmental stresses,
[39:01.830 --> 39:07.350]  including insects and diseases. Bloom formulated fertilizers often include increased levels of
[39:07.350 --> 39:13.030]  potassium because it helps improve flower quality. So potassium is found in both grow and bloom
[39:13.030 --> 39:17.510]  fertilizers because Tony was saying that it's good towards the end of veg. It helps the plant's
[39:17.510 --> 39:22.150]  immune system and it increases flower quality. You'll see it in most of your bloom boosters. It'll
[39:22.150 --> 39:27.350]  be real high in potassium. So if you're looking for a bloom booster and a bud hardener, that last
[39:27.350 --> 39:32.470]  number on the bottle, that's the one you're looking at. So would you agree with me that
[39:32.470 --> 39:38.230]  that's the basics of the NPK? Yeah. You want to start high in nitrogen and then end very low,
[39:39.030 --> 39:47.830]  and then start mid to low potassium and end very, very high. And then the phosphorus kind of
[39:47.830 --> 39:51.590]  goes in like a little mountain hump. There's some plants I feel like you almost can't give
[39:51.590 --> 39:58.070]  them too much phosphorus. It's a timing thing, actually. I feed them a bunch of it right as
[39:58.070 --> 40:04.950]  they're going into flower. And then when I noticed the buds have naturally stopped swelling up,
[40:04.950 --> 40:11.670]  I dose them with quite a bit more. And then their little metabolism kicks back on for one more week.
[40:11.670 --> 40:17.030]  Yeah. If you kick a lot of potassium in them, it keeps them moving. It definitely keeps them
[40:17.030 --> 40:21.190]  from slowing down and your plants don't get as lazy. All right. So we'll talk a little more
[40:21.190 --> 40:25.270]  specifically about when to feed things to our plants. When the plants are young, we kind of
[40:25.270 --> 40:29.670]  covered this, but when the plants are young, they don't require as much fertilization. I focus on
[40:29.670 --> 40:34.310]  root building when the plants are young. Mycos are your friend and enzymes are too. We've talked
[40:34.310 --> 40:38.150]  about mycos and enzymes on the show before. We'll come back to that once we get all the basics
[40:38.150 --> 40:43.910]  covered. That's your OGT and your hygrozyme if you guys are looking for products. Use them just like
[40:43.910 --> 40:48.470]  they say on the bottle. Those are perfect. Small plants want nitrogen to grow strong. A little bit
[40:48.470 --> 40:54.230]  of phosphorus will help them build roots and grow vigorously. A little potassium will keep them
[40:54.230 --> 40:58.790]  healthy. Your basic veg nutrients probably have enough NPK to get you through your veg phase.
[40:59.350 --> 41:02.950]  If you veg for long periods, you may need to add some calcium magnesium.
[41:04.150 --> 41:07.590]  That's something that larger plants will start running out of. So let's talk a little bit about
[41:07.590 --> 41:12.230]  CalMag while we're here. Calcium and magnesium are what are known as secondary nutrients.
[41:12.870 --> 41:17.590]  Calcium is a big part of the cell structure and cellular growth. Calcium stimulates enzymes that
[41:17.590 --> 41:23.270]  build strong roots and cell walls. Magnesium is essential to absorb light energy. If your
[41:23.270 --> 41:29.750]  plants are slow and lazy, they may be experiencing a magnesium deficiency. Yeah, there's certain types
[41:29.750 --> 41:35.430]  of yellowing between the veins. It's magnesium deficiency. Magnesium is actually what makes
[41:35.430 --> 41:40.390]  chlorophyll green. A little bit of humega from Organicare will speed your plants up when they
[41:40.390 --> 41:45.270]  start getting lazy like that. Yeah. Yeah. So in the beginning, you need nitrogen, a little
[41:45.270 --> 41:49.270]  phosphorus, and a little potassium. If you're looking for big roots, definitely add some type
[41:49.270 --> 41:54.070]  of mycos or root inoculant. I always brag about the OGT and great white shark together. That
[41:54.070 --> 41:59.910]  shit works great for your roots. You get big, fat, white roots. If you feed OGT and great white shark
[41:59.910 --> 42:03.750]  along with your mix, your regular feed schedule in the morning, right when the plants come on,
[42:03.750 --> 42:08.950]  if you go in about two hours later, most of your leaves will be pointing straight up and they're
[42:08.950 --> 42:13.110]  praying and thanking you. They're saying, holy shit, I love that. That's what they're doing.
[42:13.110 --> 42:17.270]  They love that shit. If your plants get a little too big in veg, you're going to need CalMag.
[42:17.270 --> 42:20.870]  Once you enter the flower phase, totally like we talked about, reduce the nitrogen.
[42:20.870 --> 42:24.230]  The first two weeks of flower won't show you much. Keep the plants fed and happy. I use my
[42:24.230 --> 42:28.630]  grow-based nutrient until week three of flower, like I was talking about. I feel like it keeps
[42:28.630 --> 42:34.870]  them nicely nitrogened up until the end of flower. I add some CalMag and put some potassium silicates
[42:34.870 --> 42:42.470]  in and also some type of kelp at week three. That's CalMag, potassium silicates, and kelp at
[42:42.470 --> 42:47.190]  week three. I'll add liquid karma and sweet at week three also. When you start week three of
[42:47.190 --> 42:50.630]  flower, you can drop out most of the nitrogen and really start pumping up the P and K.
[42:51.350 --> 42:58.150]  Week four, I do the same thing as week three. We should be low on nitrogen and pumping up the P and
[42:58.150 --> 43:03.350]  K. I'd add some kelp and a small amount of molasses by now. I would also add some enzymes to my mix.
[43:03.350 --> 43:09.910]  I'd be running the whole Botanic Care feed chart by week four. Here we go. Week five is where I
[43:09.910 --> 43:13.670]  really pound my plants with food. I think day 30 is where they're really ready for sugars and
[43:13.670 --> 43:18.310]  boosters. That's when they're really ready to get hammered with a lot of stuff. I've dropped the
[43:18.310 --> 43:23.590]  nitrogen by now and I'm feeding heavy doses of P and K. I'd be adding my bloom boosters and lots
[43:23.590 --> 43:28.870]  of molasses and sugars. CalMag would be super important for the next couple of weeks. Enzymes
[43:28.870 --> 43:35.110]  and kelp would also be helpful for big tasty buds. I think kelp, I use a lot of C-Plex. I think
[43:35.110 --> 43:40.870]  all that kelp really adds to the stink and the density. It really adds to the... Some flavors,
[43:40.870 --> 43:46.630]  if they have that foot, cushy skunk smell, that stink, it makes them come out a little bit better
[43:46.630 --> 43:52.710]  if you add a lot of kelp. You should add some potassium silicates for thick branches at this
[43:52.710 --> 43:57.190]  time, like week five, week 30-ish. Maybe you could have put those in at week four, but if you've got
[43:57.190 --> 44:00.870]  good healthy plants, I think they're cool on week five. You just need them to build those branches
[44:00.870 --> 44:04.310]  up a little bit while the buds grow super thick because they're going to start falling over if
[44:04.310 --> 44:09.750]  you don't have some kind of tomato cages. Week five is basically your bloom-based nutrients,
[44:09.750 --> 44:16.470]  lots of bud boosters, sugars, enzymes, potassium silicates, and kelp. Week six will basically be
[44:16.470 --> 44:21.510]  the same thing. Focus on your bud boosters and sugars and get that stuff up there as high as
[44:21.510 --> 44:26.550]  you can without burning the plants. Put a lot of molasses in there, a lot of P and K products,
[44:27.270 --> 44:32.470]  and some enzymes in there to keep all of that stuff moving. You do the same thing up to
[44:33.190 --> 44:37.510]  however long you need to go. Week seven, week eight, usually don't feed after week nine. You
[44:37.510 --> 44:41.510]  should start flushing by week eight. Most plants aren't going to go more than 10 weeks. If you're
[44:41.510 --> 44:45.190]  growing a plant that takes more than 10 weeks, I hope your experience and I hope all of this stuff
[44:45.190 --> 44:50.710]  already makes sense to you because that's going to be a bitch for you to grow an 11-week plant
[44:50.710 --> 44:56.150]  without this knowledge. Once you get to week eight and you've gotten done feeding these plants and
[44:56.150 --> 45:00.230]  keeping them happy and healthy, you need to flush. We've just talked about how much stuff
[45:00.230 --> 45:07.270]  we poured into these plants. Now you need to spend at least 10 to 14 days with nothing but water in
[45:07.270 --> 45:13.430]  these plants. On Monday, however much, if you've got a five-gallon pot, pour water through it until
[45:13.430 --> 45:17.030]  that shit's running through, until your tray is almost full, until you're worried about it.
[45:17.030 --> 45:20.870]  If you have a way to get that water out of the tray, that's ideal. Get that water out of there
[45:20.870 --> 45:25.910]  and let those plants sit until they're almost dry and do the same thing all over again. Do that for
[45:25.910 --> 45:30.230]  the next 10 to 14 days. Try to get three or four cycles of just clean water through there so that
[45:30.230 --> 45:34.630]  you can push out all the nitrogen, the phosphorus, the potassium, the calcium, the magnesium,
[45:35.270 --> 45:39.590]  the mycos that we just put in there. You need to clean your soil out. You want to get all that
[45:39.590 --> 45:46.230]  stuff out of there. Now if you have really clean sorts of molasses, you could use that.
[45:47.190 --> 45:54.950]  Your first flush watering, quite a bit of that. Sugars displace salts. That's why all the
[45:55.910 --> 46:00.070]  Clear-X that they'll sell you, Clear-X is just a bunch of different types of sugars,
[46:01.510 --> 46:06.790]  displaces salt, but it feeds all of your mycos. Basically, it feeds all of them,
[46:06.790 --> 46:11.350]  boosts their colonization up, and they end up eating any residual food that's left.
[46:11.350 --> 46:14.230]  They eat a bunch of it for you, like little garbage disposals. It's pretty nice.
[46:14.230 --> 46:20.230]  He just said sugars displace salts, you guys. Most of the nutrients you're feeding are salts,
[46:20.790 --> 46:24.790]  and your plants are filled with salts. Salts don't taste so good. Sugar,
[46:24.790 --> 46:27.990]  sounds like it tastes good. If you put some sugars in there when you're flushing,
[46:27.990 --> 46:31.670]  it'll push the salts out of your plants. It'll also clean up the soil. It'll break it up,
[46:31.670 --> 46:36.630]  kind of. It goes in there and stirs it around. Right? Yeah. It feeds your hungry mycos.
[46:36.630 --> 46:41.750]  Which is always awesome. I want to go to a website. This is where I got a lot of the information
[46:41.750 --> 46:47.830]  about, just a lot of information from this show. It's called marijuanagrowershq.com,
[46:47.830 --> 46:51.750]  is where I got a lot of it. I also got some guidance from the Botanicare website.
[46:52.470 --> 46:55.670]  I'm kind of looking at their feed charts to keep in mind what I would feed every week,
[46:55.670 --> 47:00.470]  because I don't have my own feed chart in my hand, because it's in the growth spaces. I don't carry
[47:00.470 --> 47:06.230]  that around. That was a shout out to the people that made the charts easy for me to figure out,
[47:06.230 --> 47:12.470]  and they made NPK easy for everyone to understand. I think we should stop there on the nutrient
[47:12.470 --> 47:17.190]  lessons, because we're 45 minutes in, 47 minutes, and I think if we go any further, we'll end up
[47:17.190 --> 47:21.670]  running over an hour, and you potheads run out of attention span at 45 minutes. I can tell how
[47:21.670 --> 47:25.670]  long you listen. Stitcher tells me. Tony can definitely tell how long you're listening,
[47:25.670 --> 47:31.030]  because he runs all my web stats. We've had about 5,000 listens on the past few episodes,
[47:31.830 --> 47:37.030]  which is remarkable. I want to thank all 5,000 of you. I hope all 5,000 of you continue to listen.
[47:38.550 --> 47:42.470]  It seems like it's about time to wrap up the show. I don't feel like I have much more to cover.
[47:42.470 --> 47:45.910]  Where was that page that I had my topics? I think I covered them all. We're going to say we did,
[47:45.910 --> 47:49.350]  because I can't find the damn paper. We had to have covered all the topics.
[47:50.070 --> 47:56.070]  The Cannabis Cup was over Thanksgiving. The Vault Genetics, DNA Genetics, big shout out. Shout out
[47:56.070 --> 47:59.590]  to Crockett. I don't remember exactly who won everything, but big shout out to everybody that
[47:59.590 --> 48:04.150]  took home prizes. I hope everybody has a safe trip home. The Cannabis Cup got raided, and they
[48:04.150 --> 48:09.350]  shut it down, so they had to move everything. There was no big smokeout expo. All that they
[48:09.350 --> 48:12.950]  did have was the concerts that were supposed to happen. I hope everybody got home. I hope
[48:12.950 --> 48:18.230]  nobody got in any trouble. Now that the show's over, yes, the show is over. Now that the show
[48:18.230 --> 48:21.830]  is over, dude, Tony, thanks for coming. No problem. It was good finally having you on the show, bro.
[48:21.830 --> 48:24.710]  It's been a minute. Yeah, you've been working with me for quite a while. We never had you on a
[48:24.710 --> 48:29.590]  podcast. I appreciate you coming. Do you have an Instagram or something you want people to follow
[48:29.590 --> 48:37.430]  you on? Yeah, LXTRVN. LXTRVN on Instagram. Follow him. He posts a lot of cool pictures of Ghost OG.
[48:38.230 --> 48:42.470]  We might be in a personal friendly competition over growing this Ghost OG.
[48:42.470 --> 48:46.230]  It's kind of fun. So check out his Ghost pics and my Ghost pics, and then leave some comments.

[49:42.550 --> 49:46.950]  A big shout out to my ninja, Spence. Guys, until next time, thanks for listening. Take a fat dab
[49:46.950 --> 49:48.150]  and give your mom a hug for me.
[50:07.590 --> 50:08.150]  the night
[50:09.750 --> 50:11.030]  sweet sense of me
[50:15.670 --> 50:17.910]  i remember the day when
[50:18.870 --> 50:20.470]  jaja showed me the way
