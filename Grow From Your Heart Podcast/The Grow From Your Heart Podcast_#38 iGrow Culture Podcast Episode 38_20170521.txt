[00:04.920 --> 00:09.880]  Yeah, what's going on podcast world? Welcome to episode number 38 of the I Grow Culture
[00:09.880 --> 00:14.280]  podcast. I'm your host Rasta Jeff. Thanks for joining me for another episode. I'm coming
[00:14.280 --> 00:20.280]  to you today, November 1st, the day after Halloween, and I am proud to report that nobody
[00:20.280 --> 00:24.600]  gave any trick-or-treaters cannabis infused candy. I'm proud of you guys and I want to
[00:24.600 --> 00:28.320]  say thanks. I've got a little bit of a news article here that I want to read if I can
[00:28.320 --> 00:33.160]  get it to pop up. Hello. All right, we've got a news article here. It is from the Denver
[00:33.160 --> 00:40.200]  Associated Press. The headline is Halloween Pot Candy Scare Baseless So Far. The article
[00:40.200 --> 00:44.640]  says police in Colorado have warned parents to look out for pot-laced Halloween candy,
[00:44.640 --> 00:49.600]  but parents don't seem too worried. A Denver-based testing company offered a thousand free kits
[00:49.600 --> 00:53.560]  to parents wanting to screen their trick-or-treaters haul for marijuana psychoactive chemical.
[00:53.560 --> 00:59.640]  However, only 45 parents took CBC Scientific up on the offer as of Friday. There have been
[00:59.640 --> 01:05.400]  no reported cases of people slipping marijuana into unsuspecting trick-or-treaters in Colorado
[01:05.400 --> 01:10.280]  or in any other state, but the popularity of pot candies in the new retail market in
[01:10.280 --> 01:16.080]  Colorado prompted warnings this fall from police in Denver, Fort Collins, and Pueblo.
[01:16.080 --> 01:19.880]  As of Halloween morning, Denver police and the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center
[01:19.880 --> 01:25.320]  reported no calls about marijuana and Halloween candy. My honest opinion is that it's an overblown
[01:25.320 --> 01:30.720]  fear that was created by the police, said CB Scientific CEO Bill Short. The company's
[01:30.720 --> 01:35.920]  $15 kits are usually used by medical marijuana patients to test the potency of their weed.
[01:35.920 --> 01:40.480]  The kits include small beakers and a liquid that turns reddish in the presence of THC,
[01:40.480 --> 01:45.880]  marijuana's active ingredient. I'm going to jump in here. Marijuana does not have ingredients.
[01:45.880 --> 01:50.760]  Marijuana is a plant, so you don't need ingredients to mix it together and make a plant. But nice
[01:50.760 --> 01:55.160]  try. Short said the free kits were available to parents anywhere, but that nearly all their
[01:55.160 --> 01:59.760]  requests came from Colorado. We stepped in to tell parents, don't be spooked. We're not
[01:59.760 --> 02:04.640]  trying to jump on some fear-mongering bandwagon, Short said. Since January, Children's Hospital
[02:04.640 --> 02:09.560]  Colorado has reported nine admissions for children accidentally consuming edible marijuana.
[02:09.560 --> 02:13.520]  It's unclear whether those cases were from homemade treats or edible marijuana purchased
[02:13.520 --> 02:18.040]  products sold at dispensaries. Colorado police have said they're just trying to boost awareness
[02:18.040 --> 02:22.520]  because of a wider availability of pot candies. The Larimer County Sheriff's Department, for
[02:22.520 --> 02:26.960]  example, said in its warning that vigilance is necessary because marijuana candies don't
[02:26.960 --> 02:32.800]  necessarily appear unusual. THC infused edibles are often designed to look very similar to popular
[02:32.800 --> 02:38.240]  name brand treats. The office warned in Washington State, the other state with legal, sorry, I'm gonna
[02:38.240 --> 02:42.280]  start that sentence over again. In Washington State, the only other state with legal recreational
[02:42.280 --> 02:47.960]  pot sales, authorities have been more circumspect. A sheriff's detective in Pierce County, Washington
[02:47.960 --> 02:53.880]  wrote a newspaper column saying pot showing up in trick-or-treat bags is an urban myth. It's too
[02:53.880 --> 02:58.080]  expensive, hard to get, and users of these products are pretty laid back and not generally terrifying
[02:58.080 --> 03:02.000]  in nature, the detective said. My page just refreshed, let me scroll back down to where I was.
[03:02.000 --> 03:06.320]  There's something going on with my internet where I am today, so I may lose my connection a couple
[03:06.320 --> 03:12.520]  times, but we will make that happen. Where was I now? It's too expensive, it's hard to get, and
[03:12.520 --> 03:16.640]  these guys are laid back and generally not terrifying in nature, Detective Ed Troyer wrote
[03:16.640 --> 03:20.760]  Monday in the Tacoma Weekly, and you know, I think Ed's got the right idea. It's too
[03:20.760 --> 03:26.880]  expensive, first of all. Edibles at a dispensary are kind of expensive, and people that are buying
[03:26.880 --> 03:31.720]  and using cannabis, we're not mean, most of us are not mean-spirited people. We don't want to
[03:31.720 --> 03:36.360]  play tricks on people, we don't want to give people cannabis, and I think most of us have realized
[03:36.360 --> 03:42.280]  that if we do that, we are fighting down our own movement. So my point here is that I'm glad nobody
[03:42.400 --> 03:47.920]  gave anybody any cannabis-infused candies over Halloween. My other point is that that's a lot of
[03:47.920 --> 03:52.640]  hype and a lot of fear, so if you guys are believing that, relax a little bit. It's not as big of a
[03:52.640 --> 03:59.920]  fear as we thought it was. So I hope everybody had a happy and safe Halloween. I am going to continue
[03:59.920 --> 04:03.920]  with this next news article, and then we'll do a couple of ads. This one's kind of related. Part of
[04:03.920 --> 04:09.040]  that article that I just read said that a lot of edibles are designed to look like popular candies,
[04:09.920 --> 04:15.680]  but no more. This article comes from the Denver Post, and it is written by David Magoya. The
[04:15.680 --> 04:21.600]  headline says, Ganja Joy No More! Colorado Edibles Firm Settles Suit Over Hershey Look-A-Likes.
[04:22.960 --> 04:28.080]  The article says, the small Colorado Springs-based producer of marijuana edibles sued in June by
[04:28.080 --> 04:33.040]  candy giant The Hershey Company for allegedly breaching a number of design and name patents
[04:33.040 --> 04:37.600]  quietly settled the dispute. In a settlement penned in late September, Tincture Bell agreed
[04:37.600 --> 04:42.400]  to recall and destroy all edibles it sold that looked like the famed chocolate company's products
[04:42.400 --> 04:48.240]  or with names that played on their brands. Though the edibles company said it had long ago stopped
[04:48.240 --> 04:52.800]  making products that appeared like those products by Hershey, including well-known names such as
[04:52.800 --> 04:57.760]  Reese's, Almond Joy, and Heath, long before the federal lawsuit was filed in June in U.S. District
[04:57.760 --> 05:02.720]  Court in Denver, the settlement makes sure it won't happen again. So these guys were making
[05:03.280 --> 05:08.560]  edibles and some of them were delicious dude. They make a Reefers peanut butter bar that looks
[05:08.560 --> 05:13.440]  just like the Reese's peanut butter bar but it says Reefers on it. The packaging was the same
[05:13.440 --> 05:19.360]  color as the Reese's peanut butter cups. It looked very similar so I could see why Hershey's kind of
[05:19.360 --> 05:26.560]  got pissed at this. The Heath was, I forgot what they called the Heath bar, but these can candy
[05:26.560 --> 05:31.040]  bars looked just like the original candy bar and that could cause a problem. I could see that if
[05:31.040 --> 05:35.040]  your kid saw that sitting on the counter, which that shit should not be sitting out for a kid to
[05:35.040 --> 05:40.080]  get, but if he saw that Reefers bar sitting up there that kid would probably eat it and that
[05:40.080 --> 05:44.560]  kid would be wrecked and you'd be a shitty parent and then you'd be put another mark of one of those
[05:44.560 --> 05:48.880]  kids in the hospital for cannabis and you'd make the whole movement look bad. So the settlement
[05:48.880 --> 05:55.520]  also requires Tincture Bell not to use the product names Hashies, Ganja Joy, Hash Heath, Hash Heats,
[05:55.520 --> 06:00.960]  Thingamajiggy, or and Reefers nor to use the name Reefer for any candies that contain either
[06:00.960 --> 06:07.040]  peanut butter or its flavorings. The company also agreed not to make packages with brown,
[06:07.040 --> 06:11.760]  yellow, and orange colors which are those used by Reese's brand according to a copy of the statement.
[06:12.720 --> 06:16.720]  So now they can't even use any of the colors. Hershey pretty much cockblocked these guys pretty
[06:16.720 --> 06:22.000]  well from doing anything like that. Hershey's had said Tincture Bell's products harmed their
[06:22.000 --> 06:26.320]  brand name and could be confused for regular candy by children, which is kind of what I was saying.
[06:26.880 --> 06:30.960]  Tincture Bell neither admitted nor denied any allegations in the lawsuit as part of the
[06:30.960 --> 06:35.920]  settlement. You're not going to be able to get your Ganja Joy or your Reefers anymore. Those
[06:35.920 --> 06:39.440]  were super popular in California. It took them a little bit to get their way out here to Colorado,
[06:40.000 --> 06:44.880]  but we are not going to see that anymore. Guys, I feel like I'm talking really fast. I'm fired up
[06:44.880 --> 06:49.360]  for this podcast. I've had a good day. It's a super nice day outside. I got a big package in
[06:49.360 --> 06:54.400]  the mail from our friends at Sweet Leaf Farms, so I want to give them a big shout out. Thank you.
[06:54.400 --> 06:58.960]  Go check out Sweet Leaf Farms. I'm going to take a dab, dude. Hopefully I'll slow down and calm
[06:58.960 --> 07:06.480]  down just a little bit. So take a dab with me, guys. I'm going to dab some Scotts OG and Sins OG
[07:06.480 --> 07:12.160]  mix grown by Garden of Wheaton and also extracted by Garden of Wheaton. This stuff is super delicious.
[07:13.280 --> 07:20.240]  It's what won the Secret Cup regionals in Denver, but this is the shatter version and
[07:20.240 --> 07:25.920]  not the live resin version. Let's take a dab. I got a big fat chunky dab here. I'm going to hit
[07:25.920 --> 07:33.040]  the Hitman Phase 2 Cake with a highly educated, it's the Infinity Nail with an e-nail attachment
[07:33.040 --> 07:58.430]  on it. So let's take a dab together, guys. Here we go. Yeah. And that's how you take a quarter
[07:58.430 --> 08:03.310]  gram dab on a podcast. Just a little bit of a cough there. I tried not to cough in your ear.
[08:03.310 --> 08:08.590]  I'm sorry, guys. All right. Where were we? I know where we were. This podcast is brought to you by

[11:31.710 --> 11:37.070]  You guys want to do another article? Let's read another news article. This one sucks, you guys.
[11:37.070 --> 11:41.550]  I saw this in Denver. This was a real popular topic a few days ago here in Colorado. Everybody
[11:41.550 --> 11:45.790]  was talking about it. It says, this is from the Cannabis, is where I'm reading it. Let's see,
[11:45.790 --> 11:50.110]  where was it originally? This is from Jesse Paul and Noelle Phillips and John Ingold of the Denver
[11:50.110 --> 11:56.910]  Post. The headline is, Denver Police and Feds Conduct Large-Scale Raids on Marijuana Grow Sites.
[11:56.910 --> 12:00.990]  Let's get into this article and then we'll talk about it. Denver Police Officers Summon
[12:00.990 --> 12:05.950]  Hazmat Suits Raided Multiple Marijuana Growing Operations Tuesday. Part of an investigation into
[12:05.950 --> 12:11.470]  illegal marijuana sales in Minnesota, a federal law enforcement official said. Federal agents
[12:11.470 --> 12:15.950]  assisted in the raids, which saw investigators haul dozens of high-intensity grow lights and
[12:15.950 --> 12:20.910]  thousands of plants out of the operations. The federal official said as much as $1 million
[12:20.910 --> 12:25.950]  was found in large bags during the searches. The official, who was not authorized to disclose
[12:25.950 --> 12:30.110]  information about the case, and spoke to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.
[12:30.110 --> 12:36.670]  I really chopped that word, anonymity. I can't even say it. I'm reading it and can't do it.
[12:36.670 --> 12:45.150]  Anonymity. He spoke anonymously. Believe people involved came to Colorado from Minnesota where
[12:45.150 --> 12:50.430]  marijuana is illegal outside of a restrictive medical marijuana program. Officially, authorities
[12:50.430 --> 12:55.230]  released little information about the case. On Twitter, Denver Police wrote that the investigation
[12:55.230 --> 12:59.950]  involved illegal drug activity, but a spokesman for the department later said he did not know
[12:59.950 --> 13:04.350]  if the operations raided were licensed marijuana businesses or if detectives believed they were
[13:04.350 --> 13:09.790]  exclusively illegal. Denver Police did not announce any arrests connected to the raids.
[13:09.790 --> 13:14.750]  The spokeswoman for the state marijuana enforcement division, which regulates cannabis businesses,
[13:14.750 --> 13:18.110]  refused to comment on whether the division was involved in the investigation.
[13:18.830 --> 13:23.790]  Likewise, James Goeth, group supervisor of the Drug Enforcement Administration's Special Support
[13:23.790 --> 13:30.030]  Unit in Denver, offered little comment. It's a very large and successful investigation, Goeth said.
[13:31.470 --> 13:36.270]  At one raided site on North Bryant Street near West 6th Avenue, a Denver police officer was seen
[13:36.270 --> 13:41.150]  entering a building in a blue hazmat suit. The officer, his suit reeking of marijuana,
[13:41.150 --> 13:45.710]  said several search warrants were being executed around the city. The raided building on North
[13:45.710 --> 13:51.390]  Bryant Street is in an industrial area popular with state legal commercial marijuana growers
[13:51.390 --> 13:56.670]  and increasingly illegal growers trying to hide among them. The raided address was once home to
[13:56.670 --> 14:00.910]  the grow operation for a medical marijuana products business that state records show,
[14:00.910 --> 14:05.630]  but it is unclear whether the small business is still there. Cannabis industry insiders said they
[14:05.630 --> 14:09.870]  believe the address is now occupied by people claiming to be medical marijuana caregivers,
[14:09.870 --> 14:14.270]  smaller scale providers that operate with less scrutiny. At neighboring cannabis business,
[14:14.270 --> 14:19.950]  employees were bewildered by the flurry of police activity. Nate Perrini, who works at Edibles
[14:20.030 --> 14:23.870]  manufacturer Edapur, which is next door to the raided operation on North Bryant Street,
[14:23.870 --> 14:29.150]  said cops already were there when she got to work around 9 a.m. Yeah, they're getting raided,
[14:29.150 --> 14:33.790]  she said. Oh, I've seen that. I've seen. Oh, man, I've seen somebody about to get raided.
[14:33.790 --> 14:37.710]  Not somebody I knew, but there was a house in my neighborhood a few weeks ago. There were just
[14:37.710 --> 14:41.390]  vehicles like a block away. And then you could see one car driving right towards the house.
[14:41.390 --> 14:44.750]  I was like, yeah, that's just going down. They're about to get raided. It's such a weird feeling.
[14:44.750 --> 14:48.590]  Anyway, a police car was parked in front of the shop and another was parked in the alley behind
[14:48.590 --> 14:54.670]  it. Police tape had been strung around the perimeter. Tuesday's raids came 11 months after
[14:54.670 --> 14:59.390]  local and federal authorities raided several large marijuana businesses. The largest raids on
[14:59.390 --> 15:04.910]  Colorado pop businesses, excuse me, since medical marijuana became legal. Four people connected to
[15:04.910 --> 15:10.110]  the businesses raided then have been charged with federal crimes and prosecutors have also moved to
[15:10.270 --> 15:20.190]  seize the businesses assets. So from what I have read and seen recently and what's going on on
[15:20.190 --> 15:27.070]  Facebook, these facilities were not legal medical marijuana, MED registered facilities. These were
[15:27.070 --> 15:33.230]  caregivers who have kind of vague rules, but they were probably out of their plant count. And if
[15:33.230 --> 15:36.510]  they had that much money on them, they were doing something that they shouldn't have been doing.
[15:37.390 --> 15:41.550]  Um, a friend of mine on Facebook said that he saw at least a hundred lights
[15:41.550 --> 15:47.230]  stacked up outside of one of these facilities. And imagine being the guys that work at Edapierre. So
[15:48.430 --> 15:52.590]  the where, like the warehouse right here got raided and the one right next to it did not.
[15:52.590 --> 15:57.870]  And the one on the other side of it did not. And everyone's in there growing herb and you see all
[15:57.870 --> 16:02.830]  these federal agents and hazmat suits pull up and just start taking shit apart. And they come in
[16:02.830 --> 16:07.630]  with guns blazing. I'm sure. Oh man. Imagine having the legal business next door and you
[16:07.630 --> 16:11.230]  didn't get raided and you're just sitting there shit in your pants, waiting for them to come into
[16:11.230 --> 16:14.990]  your spot. You're like, what do I do? What do I do? Eventually you're like, just come in already
[16:14.990 --> 16:19.390]  because you're so freaked out. You don't know what you're waiting for anymore. Oh man. But
[16:19.390 --> 16:23.950]  from what I've seen, these places were not legal. So this wasn't the feds taking down medical
[16:23.950 --> 16:29.310]  marijuana facilities. This was actual raids on illegal grows. And I know that sounds weird being
[16:29.310 --> 16:34.510]  in Colorado, but there are a lot of these large scale illegal grows going on. I bet they'll keep
[16:34.510 --> 16:44.830]  taking them down too. All right. I've got another article. This one is, uh, this one I found on,
[16:44.830 --> 16:48.350]  where did I find this? This is from Tok of the town guys. I look at the cannabis, the Tok of
[16:48.350 --> 16:53.630]  the town. I look at a lot of websites to find my cannabis news. Um, unfortunately you have to type
[16:53.630 --> 16:58.110]  in the word marijuana to find good cannabis news. I'm trying to change that. Here's a reminder.
[16:58.190 --> 17:03.710]  Marijuana is a racist word. It was created with racism. Uh, it supports a racist connotation. So
[17:03.710 --> 17:08.750]  we're going to stop saying marijuana and let's all say cannabis. Uh, cannabis is the revolutionary
[17:08.750 --> 17:13.710]  term. Uh, the people before us, the older folks are afraid of marijuana. They're not as afraid
[17:13.710 --> 17:17.950]  of cannabis. We've kind of, it's all about the words. If you say the right words, you can convince
[17:17.950 --> 17:21.790]  people just about anything. So let's start saying cannabis and not saying marijuana.
[17:22.750 --> 17:28.990]  The headline of this article, Georgia drug agents bust man with okra and believe it is marijuana.
[17:28.990 --> 17:32.270]  This is kind of an old story. Some of you guys might've heard about it. It's from Mike Adams.
[17:33.390 --> 17:39.070]  The article says, Oh, this is really long. We might summarize some of this. Americans are no
[17:39.070 --> 17:44.110]  longer safe to cultivate common garden vegetables without risking the violent wrath of the drug war.
[17:44.670 --> 17:49.310]  No other citizen understands this lunacy quite like Georgia resident, Dwayne Perry, who told
[17:49.310 --> 17:53.870]  reporters that he was raided by drug agents earlier last week after an aerial surveillance
[17:53.870 --> 17:59.310]  unit mistook his Oprah crop for marijuana. That's right. It appears as though Georgia
[17:59.310 --> 18:03.950]  law enforcement has not had enough experience taking down marijuana grow operations to
[18:03.950 --> 18:08.750]  distinguish the difference between okra and the cannabis plant. Dude, there is a picture of an
[18:08.750 --> 18:16.270]  okra plant here. Um, does not look at all like pot to me. It's got big round leaves. The leaves are
[18:16.270 --> 18:22.590]  not serrated. It doesn't have the fingery leaves. It doesn't look like a hand. Uh, doesn't look like
[18:22.590 --> 18:27.870]  weed at all. Uh, train these guys a little more. So I'm going to summarize this article. Reports
[18:27.870 --> 18:32.030]  indicate that a drug task force was conducting a marijuana suppression mission when officers
[18:32.030 --> 18:36.430]  spotted Perry's okra plants and immediately thought he was growing weed. Okra plants,
[18:36.430 --> 18:41.230]  incidentally, consists of five fat leaves while the cannabis plant has very distinguishable
[18:41.710 --> 18:50.590]  foliage. They spelled foliage wrong here. They put F O I O L I A G messed my brain all up.
[18:50.590 --> 18:55.470]  In other words, the two plants look absolutely nothing alike. Unfortunately, that did not stop
[18:55.470 --> 19:01.630]  officers with Georgia state patrol from swooping in on Perry's residents dressed to kill is what
[19:01.630 --> 19:05.310]  it says here. In an attempt to destroy the suspected marijuana growing in his backyard,
[19:05.310 --> 19:09.470]  they were strapped to the gills, said Perry, explaining to reporters how the officers seemed
[19:09.470 --> 19:15.390]  prepared to shoot him dead on the spot over a case of mistaken identity. Oh man, these cops went
[19:15.390 --> 19:20.990]  in and raided this guy. Imagine when you get raided, it's traumatic. Uh, I've been involved
[19:20.990 --> 19:25.550]  in a couple of raids, unfortunately, knock on wood. I'm never in one of those again. The cops
[19:25.550 --> 19:29.870]  come in there. You could, they're coming into your home. You can have an AK 47. You could have a bomb.
[19:29.870 --> 19:34.670]  You could have dogs. You could be crazy as shit. And they're coming in. They are prepared for
[19:34.670 --> 19:38.510]  whatever you're doing in there. And it's scary. They put you on the ground. They cuff you. They
[19:38.510 --> 19:42.830]  put a gun to your head. They talk shit to you. Uh, if you're doing some kind of crime or in a
[19:42.830 --> 19:46.190]  house where there's some shit going on, you might expect that you might be the type of person that's
[19:46.190 --> 19:49.870]  prepared for that. You may have had police interaction and you know how to handle yourself.
[19:49.870 --> 19:57.150]  This dude is a okra grower in Georgia. I'm pretty sure he's not, uh, experienced with the SWAT team
[19:57.150 --> 20:01.710]  and the state patrol. So he probably shit his pants when they came in, probably traumatized him,
[20:01.710 --> 20:06.590]  probably traumatized his family. Now, if there are any kids there, they're scared shitless of the
[20:06.590 --> 20:11.310]  cops now. So let's get a little more. I skipped a couple of little short paragraphs. Although Perry
[20:11.310 --> 20:15.150]  is grateful that a trigger happy cop did not riddle him full of holes during the raid. He says
[20:15.150 --> 20:20.190]  there is no excuse for this level of domestic warfare over a plant. Here I am at home and
[20:20.190 --> 20:24.750]  retired. And you know, I did the right thing. Said Perry, they come to my house strapped with
[20:24.750 --> 20:30.910]  weapons for no reason. It ain't right. Several officers did apologize after further investigating
[20:30.910 --> 20:35.310]  the plant, but that simply isn't good enough says Perry, because the situation could have
[20:35.310 --> 20:39.390]  potentially gotten him killed or seriously injured. The more I thought about it, what could
[20:39.390 --> 20:43.790]  have happened? He said, anything could have happened. So I'm going to wrap up that article.
[20:44.830 --> 20:49.710]  Good job, Georgia police. Good job. I bet that, uh, that, that made you feel good. I bet that was
[20:49.710 --> 20:53.790]  a good way to spend your money, but you scared the shit out of this old retired guy for no reason.
[20:55.070 --> 20:58.750]  Instead of making friends, the cops keep making more enemies by doing shit like this.
[20:58.750 --> 21:02.270]  If you'd put down your guns and quit trying to be soldiers and just be friends and police the
[21:02.270 --> 21:06.030]  community, like we designed the police for, you'd have a lot more damn friends, I think.
[21:06.750 --> 21:11.070]  And then when shit goes wrong, the cops would have somebody to talk to. They wouldn't have to
[21:11.070 --> 21:14.110]  like when shit goes wrong. Now everybody disappears. Nobody wants to talk to the
[21:14.110 --> 21:18.430]  cops because the cops are the bad guy. Now, if you're the good guy, still, we'd want to talk to
[21:18.430 --> 21:21.310]  you because we know you'd help us. Now we don't feel like you're going to help us feel like you're
[21:21.310 --> 21:25.630]  going to kick my ass just for pulling me over. And it sucks. Shouldn't be scared to pull over.
[21:26.190 --> 21:31.870]  The cops are pulling me over. You're the guys I should trust. Anyway, I'm ranting. Uh, this is a,
[21:32.030 --> 21:36.510]  a ridiculous article. I saw this unfold on Facebook. This was highly entertaining. This
[21:36.510 --> 21:40.110]  story is a little bit old, but it's well worth talking about. We haven't done any news on the
[21:40.110 --> 21:44.910]  show for a while. We've been packing up such great shows. Here's a funny article. This one is by
[21:44.910 --> 21:51.230]  William breeds. Uh, the article is headlined idiot. Allegedly rips off pot. Grow, leave cell phone
[21:51.230 --> 21:57.230]  behind. We had a lot of fun with this one. You guys, this guy named Chris Mathers, uh, from
[21:57.230 --> 22:02.590]  Colorado. I'll just read the story. Chris Mathers is apparently a thief, but not a good one. We know
[22:02.590 --> 22:06.910]  this because the junkie scumbag left his smartphone behind earlier this week while allegedly ripping
[22:06.910 --> 22:12.990]  off a Colorado growers, outdoor garden, one of several he's allegedly burglarized. Now, thanks
[22:12.990 --> 22:19.150]  to social media, he's got the attention of local police. See this mastermind Mathers left his phone
[22:19.150 --> 22:23.790]  unlocked, which allowed the victim to pull up more than enough information on the scumbag to track
[22:23.790 --> 22:28.910]  him down and eventually get the cops involved. Details are hazy, mostly to keep the growers
[22:28.910 --> 22:33.310]  identity identity somewhat discreet. But after getting over the initial horror of seeing their
[22:33.310 --> 22:39.070]  harvest still weeks from being finished, gone, the owners of the growth were no doubt elated to find
[22:39.070 --> 22:43.870]  some rather concrete evidence leaking Mathers to their grow. No word on how Mathers would even know
[22:43.870 --> 22:49.150]  about the grow. It says in parentheses, after figuring out that the guy left his phone, his
[22:49.150 --> 22:53.710]  cell phone open for anyone to use. The grower handed things over to the social media. Here's a
[22:53.710 --> 22:59.550]  post from one of the growers friends. It says, my friends outdoor was ripped last night, one of the
[22:59.550 --> 23:04.270]  rippers dropped his phone, I'm going to post his profile below. And his buddy that was involved
[23:04.270 --> 23:09.070]  found out through reading messages, please hit me up if you know them. And quickly it escalated.
[23:09.070 --> 23:14.430]  I actually saw these posts on Facebook. And it was really it was like, it's like watching a real
[23:14.430 --> 23:22.110]  soap opera or a reality show happen on Facebook all day. So it says the victim pulled photos of a
[23:22.110 --> 23:27.310]  passed out Mathers, his address, phone number, and even a list of other grow ups he had allegedly
[23:27.310 --> 23:33.550]  ripped off. While the growers no doubt had the inclination to go beat his head in a wisely called
[23:33.550 --> 23:40.110]  the cops. After all pot is a legal thing to grow in this state. And this is outright theft. So
[23:41.070 --> 23:44.910]  there was a lot of talk on Facebook about people just going and whipping this guy's ass because we
[23:44.910 --> 23:50.110]  had his home phone number, we had his address, we knew all of his friends. He was in deep shit.
[23:51.150 --> 23:56.590]  But like this article says, it's legal to have cannabis in this state. So they called the cops.
[23:57.710 --> 24:01.070]  And I'm pretty sure this guy was arrested for this. But let's read the article says for his
[24:01.070 --> 24:05.790]  part Mathers sounds like he's near rock bottom. The grower was able to pull up text message
[24:05.790 --> 24:11.390]  conversations about Mathers Suboxone habit, stuff he used to get off heroin or oxys,
[24:11.390 --> 24:16.510]  as well as other pill popping adventures. That and he normally smokes dirt weed. Apparently,
[24:16.510 --> 24:20.670]  the grower found photos of the brick bullshit he sells for 50 announced donations on Mathers
[24:20.670 --> 24:25.230]  Facebook account. You guys should see this or this guy was selling some doodoo weed. It's brick.
[24:25.230 --> 24:32.270]  It's nasty. It looks uh, yeah, there are not it looks like little piles of cow shit or something.
[24:32.270 --> 24:38.350]  It does not look smokable to me. So this guy gets he goes and steal somebody's crop, dude,
[24:38.350 --> 24:43.390]  and he drops his cell phone behind. People had a lot of fun with him on Facebook. We taunted him.
[24:44.670 --> 24:49.230]  Allegedly, people taunted him and a lot of his friends all day long until he took down his
[24:49.230 --> 24:54.190]  entire Facebook page. And in the end, he did end up getting arrested for stealing this crop, which is
[24:54.830 --> 24:59.630]  justice and hilarious justice if you ask me. Let's read another ad because I've got one more
[24:59.630 --> 25:03.790]  ad that I've got to read for you. This podcast is brought to you in part in part by our good
[25:03.790 --> 25:09.230]  friends at tree thugger.com tree thugger.com live music lifestyle magazine. Check out tree
[25:09.230 --> 25:17.150]  thugger.com for concert and festival news and reviews www dot tree thugger.com not going to
[25:17.150 --> 25:21.070]  rant too long on this one. But man, how about that Halloween fish show? Has anybody paid any
[25:21.070 --> 25:26.190]  attention to that? I've been a fish kid for years. Nothing like a good fish show. And that Halloween
[25:26.190 --> 25:29.870]  show was kind of crazy. How long have we been going? I feel like I've been around for at least
[25:29.870 --> 25:36.990]  20 minutes here. Look at that 25 minutes. Got another news article for you guys. This one is
[25:36.990 --> 25:44.030]  really silly. I had to read this twice because I didn't understand. And then I took a couple of
[25:44.030 --> 25:47.470]  dabs dude speaking of dad, let's take a dab together. What do you guys want to dab this time
[25:47.470 --> 25:52.030]  I've got some some sour diesel nugg run. You want to take a dab of that? Let's hit some sour D.
[25:52.990 --> 25:59.550]  Let's get it going. I'm gonna hit it on my blue, highly educated carb cap and we're gonna dab out
[25:59.550 --> 26:05.950]  of the phase two with the infinity nail hooked up to the email. email you guys might not know what
[26:05.950 --> 26:11.070]  the email is. When you're dabbing, you got a titanium nail and usually you'll heat that with
[26:11.070 --> 26:15.870]  a torch right? heat it up for about till it's warm. I know about how warm I want it. You can
[26:15.870 --> 26:20.830]  almost touch the damn thing. I like it so low temp. But if you don't want to use the torch all
[26:20.830 --> 26:24.430]  the time, you can buy an email and you plug the email into the wall. It's got a little box you
[26:24.430 --> 26:27.870]  set the temperature on the box and it's got a cord that goes to the nail and the nails got a little
[26:27.870 --> 26:32.030]  coil wrapped around it. And it keeps your nail hot constantly so you don't ever have to hear the
[26:32.030 --> 26:35.310]  torch on the podcast and you don't have to waste time with the torch and you just reach up and
[26:35.310 --> 26:40.590]  take a dab. So I'm gonna I'm gonna take a dab. Join me guys. Dad with me here we go 543.
[26:58.040 --> 27:03.160]  Yeah, sour diesel nugg run that stuff tastes delicious. Oh man makes my head spin.
[27:03.720 --> 27:08.360]  Okay. Now let's read this crazy article. This other this article is once again by our good
[27:08.360 --> 27:14.200]  friend William breeds. I found this article on the toke of the town. You're gonna have to stay
[27:14.200 --> 27:18.360]  with me because this one is kind of crazy. I need to drink before I go that dad is kicking my butt.
[27:20.040 --> 27:23.480]  All right, this article headline says and you're gonna have to pay attention Wyoming
[27:23.480 --> 27:29.800]  governor candidate wants to shoot wolves because Coloradans smoke weed. I'm gonna say that again.
[27:29.880 --> 27:34.680]  Wyoming governor candidate wants to shoot wolves because Coloradans smoke weed.
[27:35.960 --> 27:41.080]  The article says Don Willis wants to kill wolves. He also wants to be governor for right now he's
[27:41.080 --> 27:46.120]  all about killing him some wolves so much so that he's made it part of his campaign strategy.
[27:46.120 --> 27:51.160]  See Wyoming has permitted wolf hunts in the past but this year a federal judge put the animals
[27:51.160 --> 27:56.600]  a key component to the water ecosystem on a protected list that pisses off Willis who has
[27:57.000 --> 28:02.360]  previously noted just wants wolves to die. Now Willis is saying that the state should allow the
[28:02.360 --> 28:08.280]  hunt despite federal protection because Colorado has legal weed. The wolf tags have been issued
[28:08.280 --> 28:12.920]  and hunters had already made plans to start their hunts. He said the disruption to hunters
[28:12.920 --> 28:18.200]  outfitters and the cost Wyoming game and fish to refund hunting permits caused by a single
[28:18.200 --> 28:24.120]  black robe judge who sits in Washington DC and has probably never been in Wyoming is outrageous
[28:24.280 --> 28:29.960]  is outrageous and should be defied by Wyoming. Yes apparently you live in you have to live in
[28:29.960 --> 28:34.920]  Wyoming to actually care about Wyoming's wolf population. Willis is now calling on hunters to
[28:34.920 --> 28:41.640]  go ahead and disobey the federal order. Colorado did just that in the legalization of pot. It's a
[28:41.640 --> 28:47.400]  federal crime to commercially grow pot and the state of Colorado defied the federal laws and it
[28:47.400 --> 28:52.680]  all worked out fine he told the Billings Gazette while carefully pointing out that he doesn't think
[28:52.680 --> 28:58.120]  people should break federal law to use cannabis nor was he endorsing cannabis use. He also taunted
[28:58.120 --> 29:02.280]  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service saying he doubted they would enforce the judge's ruling
[29:02.280 --> 29:08.120]  because they normally side with Wyoming on such matters. Current Wyoming governor Matt Mead agreed
[29:08.120 --> 29:13.320]  that the hunt should go on but stopped short of advocating advocating people disobey the federal
[29:13.320 --> 29:19.480]  protections on animals which are purely shot for trophy. Are they just shoot wolves for trophy?
[29:20.200 --> 29:25.320]  Wyoming has successfully negotiated against federal overreach and when necessary they have
[29:25.320 --> 29:31.560]  gone to court he said in a release. I do not advocate taking an extreme stand doomed to failure
[29:31.560 --> 29:36.200]  which undermines Wyoming's interests instead of moving forward. The article goes on to say that
[29:36.200 --> 29:42.040]  they are going to pretty much monitor the amount of wolves and then they will reconsider lifting
[29:42.040 --> 29:46.440]  the ban on wolf hunting but I think this is funny that the governor is like hey man they're smoking
[29:46.440 --> 29:51.000]  pot in Colorado and the feds ain't doing shit so let's shoot our wolves in Wyoming. I bet the feds
[29:51.000 --> 29:57.720]  won't do shit. I'm curious to see how that turns out. That's coming up so I might pay attention to
[29:57.720 --> 30:04.600]  that. Chances are I will forget all about that. One thing I won't forget is a big shout out to
[30:04.600 --> 30:09.080]  our friends at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies. Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two locations to

[30:34.840 --> 30:38.760]  couple of cool things lined up for you guys. We'll have an episode about growing in tents or hydro
[30:38.760 --> 30:43.400]  huts. There's a lot of great stuff coming up so look forward to those episodes. I've got one more
[30:43.400 --> 30:49.160]  news article. Let me get to it. It says Colorado Congressman urges Oregon to follow his state's
[30:49.160 --> 30:55.080]  excellent example on marijuana. So you guys in Oregon the time to vote is coming up. Please go
[30:55.080 --> 31:00.040]  vote. If you're in Oregon register to vote. Go vote. You can't bitch and complain if you don't vote.
[31:00.840 --> 31:07.560]  The article says this. Jared Paulus said in an op-ed Friday that marijuana legalization is sound
[31:07.560 --> 31:12.760]  policy and he urged Oregonians to follow in Colorado's footsteps and vote yes on recreational
[31:12.760 --> 31:17.800]  marijuana in next week's election. Colorado is approaching the first anniversary of legally
[31:17.800 --> 31:24.760]  regulated recreational marijuana for adults Paulus wrote in the Bend Bulletin. The implementation of
[31:24.760 --> 31:30.200]  our new laws has gone smoothly overall providing an excellent example for other states to follow.
[31:30.200 --> 31:35.320]  Our success has made it clear that when marijuana is regulated like alcohol it can decrease crime,
[31:35.320 --> 31:40.360]  help fund schools and drug education programs and keep money out of the hands of criminals and
[31:40.360 --> 31:46.360]  cartels. Big up. I agree with most of that. Oregon voters are considering measure 91 which would
[31:46.360 --> 31:51.000]  allow adults to possess up to eight ounces of marijuana at home and up to one ounce in public.
[31:51.640 --> 31:57.400]  Taxes on marijuana sales would fund schools, law enforcement and drug prevention and education
[31:57.400 --> 32:02.120]  programs while Oregon while the Oregon Liquor Control Commission would regulate and monitor
[32:02.120 --> 32:07.960]  the industry. Sounds like it makes sense. Let's do it. I'm excited. Oregon will soon decide whether
[32:07.960 --> 32:13.240]  to join Colorado and Washington in regulating marijuana like alcohol wrote Paulus who previously
[32:13.240 --> 32:18.680]  sponsored legislation that would do just that at the federal level. More than ever I believe it's
[32:18.680 --> 32:23.960]  time to change course on decades of failed marijuana prohibition and demonstrate viable
[32:23.960 --> 32:31.400]  effective alternatives to address the realities of marijuana today. Colorado voters legalized
[32:31.400 --> 32:37.800]  recreational marijuana in 2012 with the first sales beginning on New Year's Day 2014. Guys I
[32:37.800 --> 32:41.240]  don't know if I've mentioned this on the show before I'm sure I haven't being a smart ass.
[32:41.240 --> 32:46.120]  I was the first guy to buy recreational cannabis at the Greener Side dispensary in Pueblo Colorado.
[32:46.120 --> 32:52.920]  I got there like 5 46 o'clock in the morning and sat in line and bought weed first at one of my
[32:52.920 --> 32:58.040]  good friends dispensaries and it made me proud. Anyway uh while the rollout of the new regulatory
[32:58.040 --> 33:03.880]  regime has been has not been perfect it has largely been deemed a success. Voters supported
[33:03.880 --> 33:10.280]  the end of marijuana prohibition by a 10 percentage point margin in 2012 and have continued to support
[33:10.280 --> 33:17.320]  it. Within the regulated marketplace teens appear to have been prevented from making illegal purchases.
[33:18.600 --> 33:22.760]  The legal sale of recreational and medical marijuana has been lucrative for the state
[33:22.760 --> 33:29.640]  generating about 30 million dollars in taxes and fees. The Colorado Legislative Council
[33:29.640 --> 33:35.960]  forecasts that in the first full fiscal year of legal recreational sales the state will rake in
[33:35.960 --> 33:44.280]  47.7 million dollars. That's a lot of money. If Oregon passes measure 91 the state's financial
[33:44.280 --> 33:49.240]  estimate committee projects that additional tax revenues could range from 17 million
[33:49.240 --> 33:54.840]  to 40 million dollars annually. A recent study from the personal finance site NerdWallet placed
[33:54.840 --> 34:02.040]  the forecast range for Oregon between 50 million and 100 million dollars in tax revenue. Voters in
[34:02.040 --> 34:07.960]  Alaska and the District of Columbia will also decide whether to legalize recreational cannabis
[34:07.960 --> 34:15.720]  on November 4th. Guys you know what I'm gonna say go vote go vote to legalize recreational cannabis.
[34:15.720 --> 34:23.080]  If you are in Alaska and the District of Columbia you better be voting November 4th.
[34:23.080 --> 34:28.040]  If you are in Oregon go vote. You guys have to make this happen. All right you can't bitch and
[34:28.040 --> 34:32.840]  complain if you don't vote. If you have a mail-in ballot mail it in. November 4th is your day all
[34:32.840 --> 34:37.320]  right. All right guys I feel like that's enough of me ranting and that's also enough news. I felt like
[34:37.320 --> 34:41.320]  I hadn't done a news episode in a while. I've been packing episodes really full of a lot of stuff and
[34:41.320 --> 34:45.240]  been leaving the news out. So let's start wrapping up the show guys. Who gets a shout out this week?
[34:45.800 --> 34:49.720]  I want to send a big shout out again to Sweet Leaf Farms. I want to send a huge shout out to
[34:49.720 --> 34:53.000]  Task Rock. Thanks for letting me play your music in the background. Right now you're listening to
[34:53.000 --> 34:58.840]  Task Rock, TNL the movement. Also a huge shout out to Angela. What's up girl? And also these guys
[34:58.840 --> 35:03.480]  don't pay for this advertisement but a big huge extra thank you to the Mate Factor in Manitou
[35:03.480 --> 35:08.200]  Springs. If you're ever in Manitou Springs and you need a vegetarian treat stop in there. They've got
[35:08.200 --> 35:14.280]  great wraps and sandwiches. Get yourself a dark roast mate. You'll be wired up for the whole day.
[35:14.280 --> 35:18.360]  Shout out to the Mate Factor. They always take good care of us. I drive an hour to go eat there
[35:18.360 --> 35:24.280]  and an hour back so that's how good that place is. Check me out in the next episode because Jesse
[35:24.280 --> 35:30.200]  should be here if all goes well. We will talk more about building your grow room. Then we'll have
[35:30.200 --> 35:33.960]  another episode that is not about building and then we'll do an episode about grow tents is what
[35:33.960 --> 35:38.520]  I think is coming up. Then we'll start getting back on track about more grow lessons and stuff
[35:38.520 --> 35:43.880]  like that. So let's do the part where we wrap up the show. Where did I put that paper? It helps to
[35:43.880 --> 35:49.480]  be prepared you guys. It goes like this. Hey also I do need a theme song for the show so I can quit
[35:49.480 --> 35:54.360]  playing Task Rock and Nicotine and that cheesy reggae song that I made. If you guys have any
[35:54.360 --> 35:59.880]  musical skills I like dance hall reggae. Maybe a nice roots reggae beat. Something like that you
[35:59.880 --> 36:03.080]  know just something that's chill that I could play in the background while I talk or maybe at the
[36:03.080 --> 36:09.000]  opening of the show. I would appreciate it. I'm not begging. I'm just begging. But now that the
