[00:02.880 --> 00:20.680]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:20.680 --> 00:24.040]  It's time for episode number 219 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:24.280 --> 00:28.240]  You're a source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right.
[00:28.240 --> 00:30.160]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:30.160 --> 00:33.920]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:34.040 --> 00:37.000]  or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:37.400 --> 00:41.160]  this my friends is the podcast for you. I'm your host.
[00:41.240 --> 00:44.040]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:44.400 --> 00:47.400]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the
[00:47.400 --> 00:50.360]  Mystic Roots band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:51.400 --> 00:55.160]  Big shout out to Kat, Koot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:55.160 --> 00:57.920]  I had that music up really loud. I apologize for that. Welcome to the party.
[00:57.920 --> 01:00.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm in a good ass mood.
[01:00.400 --> 01:01.680]  Not sure why I'm in such a good mood.
[01:02.120 --> 01:04.280]  I do know that when I get done recording this podcast,
[01:04.280 --> 01:08.520]  I am going to go watch the live stream of the widespread panic concerts from
[01:08.540 --> 01:13.240]  Red Rocks. I thought about going. I used to be a huge widespread panic hippie.
[01:13.240 --> 01:15.400]  I used to love that shit. I'm a little,
[01:15.440 --> 01:17.480]  no offense to widespread panic or their fans or anything.
[01:17.480 --> 01:21.160]  I'm a little bit burned out on panic. I saw a lot of shows. I went to a lot.
[01:21.480 --> 01:25.680]  And I can't go to every show. I can't see every band. So I pick and choose.
[01:25.700 --> 01:28.960]  And lately it's the ones I choose to see are Fish.
[01:29.000 --> 01:33.280]  I'll see Fish religiously until I die. I like to go see Dead and Company.
[01:33.720 --> 01:35.760]  And then I like to catch comedy shows. I'm getting old.
[01:36.560 --> 01:39.720]  Turning into a grumpy old man. All the young kids like to come talk at shows.
[01:39.720 --> 01:41.560]  I've complained about that on previous episodes.
[01:41.920 --> 01:44.880]  I would prefer to go check out comedy shows. It's a little more organized.
[01:45.080 --> 01:49.120]  It's smaller. It's more my thing. I like comedy works in Denver, but whatever.
[01:49.120 --> 01:51.480]  I'm ranting. I'm rambling already. Thanks for joining me.
[01:51.640 --> 01:52.360]  When I get done with this,
[01:52.360 --> 01:55.720]  I get to go check out the live stream of widespread panic at Red Rocks.
[01:55.720 --> 01:56.640]  It's all rainy anyway.
[01:56.640 --> 02:00.160]  So I think we might've lucked out by not driving to Red Rocks and dealing with
[02:00.160 --> 02:02.720]  that bullshit in the rain. We get to be here on the couch, watching it,
[02:02.720 --> 02:06.440]  taking dabs. Don't have to sneak our shit in. Also,
[02:07.280 --> 02:09.760]  we get to play a game in Pueblo, Colorado. We are,
[02:10.080 --> 02:13.560]  uh, there are some hood sections of this town.
[02:13.560 --> 02:15.920]  Some parts of this town can be a little sketchy. There's some, uh,
[02:16.320 --> 02:20.200]  some nefarious characters in this town. I think I said that correctly. Uh,
[02:20.440 --> 02:23.400]  so we are playing a game right now of gunshots or fireworks.
[02:23.960 --> 02:27.040]  Fourth of July is creeping up on us, but also when it gets summertime,
[02:27.040 --> 02:30.840]  the gangsters get crazy and I keep hearing a bunch of loud booms.
[02:31.480 --> 02:34.520]  And right now I'm curious as to the one I just heard a couple seconds ago,
[02:34.840 --> 02:37.640]  that could have been a 12 gauge. That also could have been a firework.
[02:37.760 --> 02:40.800]  The sun is still up. It's not quite dark yet.
[02:41.360 --> 02:45.920]  So it's kind of weird to have fireworks going. Hopefully it was a firework,
[02:45.940 --> 02:48.960]  but until I hear some sirens, I won't know anything right now.
[02:49.520 --> 02:53.040]  We're playing a game with gunshots or fireworks. Place your bets.
[02:53.060 --> 02:54.680]  Maybe by the end of the episode, we'll know something.
[02:55.480 --> 02:57.800]  If they're being on the door to ask me questions, I won't hear shit.
[02:57.800 --> 03:00.440]  Cause I got these headphones on and I got the noise canceling stuff on the
[03:00.440 --> 03:03.520]  software. I ain't getting here. God damn thing. All right.
[03:04.520 --> 03:08.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, I got some, uh, and let me, let me start by saying,
[03:08.760 --> 03:11.440]  they do not pay me to say this. I'm just happy with my purchase.
[03:11.440 --> 03:16.080]  I picked up some Durban poison batter from our friends at apothecary.
[03:16.080 --> 03:20.240]  I've been digging the apothecary extracts. I am high as shit. And I am rambling.
[03:20.240 --> 03:21.880]  Oh, also I took a dab of the, uh,
[03:21.920 --> 03:25.360]  the Durban poison and I love Durban poison. It's one of my favorite strains.
[03:25.360 --> 03:28.600]  They got me super blazed. Uh, it's really uplifting.
[03:28.600 --> 03:31.760]  It's a really like a head high. It makes me, uh,
[03:31.840 --> 03:34.440]  when I used to smoke a lot of weed, my eyes would get droopy and dabs.
[03:34.440 --> 03:37.800]  Don't do that. Dabs make my eyes get bug eyed and all like that. Super high.
[03:38.240 --> 03:42.200]  This gives me a nice eye high and I enjoy it, but it doesn't get me. Uh,
[03:42.240 --> 03:44.520]  I can't get high enough. I can't reach what I'm trying to do.
[03:45.400 --> 03:48.000]  I also picked up something on somebody else's recommendation.
[03:48.400 --> 03:51.400]  I got some Mambo batter. This one's marked as a hybrid.
[03:51.920 --> 03:55.600]  So usually I'm not a fan of hash.
[03:55.640 --> 03:58.080]  I like flowers that tastes like Kush and diesel,
[03:58.360 --> 04:00.560]  but I don't like hash that tastes like cushion diesel.
[04:01.080 --> 04:03.920]  I opened this up. I'm smelling it right now.
[04:05.120 --> 04:09.160]  It's got like a, like a real earthy, cushy diesel,
[04:09.160 --> 04:12.680]  sort of a thing going on. It smells like star dog or maybe gorilla glue.
[04:12.680 --> 04:16.920]  I think it's very likely a gorilla glue blend of glue and something else.
[04:17.600 --> 04:21.240]  There's another flavor in there also. When I first dabbed it, I was like, Oh,
[04:21.240 --> 04:22.840]  I'm not fond of the flavor of that,
[04:22.880 --> 04:27.640]  but I got super high and the high it gave me was like this weird,
[04:28.080 --> 04:31.760]  uh, clear head high. I was just, I felt like I wanted to give a sermon.
[04:31.760 --> 04:34.280]  I was like, ask me a question. I could talk about anything for five hours.
[04:34.280 --> 04:37.240]  Right now. I took a dab at that also. Uh,
[04:37.240 --> 04:41.040]  and I'm learning that that flavor is growing on me. I think my brain knows, Hey,
[04:41.040 --> 04:42.800]  when you taste that, you get that cool feeling.
[04:42.840 --> 04:46.480]  So my brain might be knowing that I want to smoke more of that type of turf,
[04:46.800 --> 04:51.320]  more of that type of flavor. So I'm going to blame a lot of this rambles on,
[04:51.720 --> 04:53.360]  uh, first of all, shout out to Dr. Pepper.
[04:53.400 --> 04:56.800]  I got to break myself with this caffeine, Dr. Pepper habit. But, uh,
[04:57.080 --> 05:02.080]  the rambles are from some Durban poison batter and some Mambo batter.
[05:02.280 --> 05:07.080]  They taste delicious. Uh, I prefer shatter. I think is my favorite for, uh,
[05:07.120 --> 05:08.360]  just all the time smoking,
[05:09.000 --> 05:12.840]  but the high cannabinoid full spectrum extract is a good treat.
[05:12.880 --> 05:15.720]  Like if you're going out for something fancy, that's the one to get.
[05:16.040 --> 05:18.440]  If I'm trying to medicate for my head, uh,
[05:18.480 --> 05:19.920]  cause I do have a traumatic brain injury.
[05:19.920 --> 05:23.120]  If I'm trying to calm down the stuff that comes from that distillate is the way
[05:23.960 --> 05:27.000]  If I want to take a big fat dab that makes my lungs go,
[05:27.680 --> 05:30.880]  and my eyes go red for a minute and water come out of the corner of my eyes,
[05:31.320 --> 05:36.200]  this batter really does it. I can put, it's hard to scoop up a lot,
[05:36.200 --> 05:39.680]  but if you get the right dab tool, you can scoop up a nice chunky dab of it.
[05:40.520 --> 05:42.360]  Uh, let the nail cool. Not, not too cool,
[05:42.360 --> 05:45.160]  but I let it go a little cooler than I do some shatter and just drop a lot in
[05:45.160 --> 05:48.320]  there and cap it. And I get such a nice dab out of it.
[05:48.320 --> 05:53.000]  Like such a real fat dab and it feels, I don't know. I don't vape.
[05:53.400 --> 05:54.280]  Cause I'm a grown man,
[05:54.680 --> 05:57.640]  but I feel like that's probably what vaping feels like.
[05:57.640 --> 06:00.840]  It just feels smooth in the lungs. It's really nice. There's no cough to it.
[06:00.840 --> 06:03.680]  It's not heavy. Uh, I really liked the batter.
[06:04.600 --> 06:08.160]  It's not something I would buy every day and dab every day. Uh,
[06:08.160 --> 06:11.960]  it's not the same price as shatter. And of course we know that I grow my own,
[06:12.360 --> 06:13.200]  uh, flowers.
[06:13.200 --> 06:17.680]  So I am able to have my stuff processed into shatter by a friend. Uh, so I don't,
[06:17.680 --> 06:19.200]  I don't go buy shatter or anything,
[06:19.400 --> 06:22.440]  but when I want something fancy, like a treat for myself, I'll go hit apothecary.
[06:22.440 --> 06:23.720]  I'll go hit a couple other places.
[06:24.000 --> 06:28.000]  I'll run to three rivers and grab some stuff, uh, and like to spoil myself.
[06:28.200 --> 06:30.120]  The batter has been what I've been going to.
[06:31.000 --> 06:34.160]  I've got some of the lemon Jeffrey high cannabinoid full spectrum extracts in
[06:34.160 --> 06:37.800]  here. I've got the lemon Jeff, uh, high terpene full spectrum extract.
[06:37.800 --> 06:39.960]  I've been pouring those together. Uh,
[06:40.000 --> 06:44.760]  our friend Sean over at apothecary recommended that I do two grams of
[06:44.760 --> 06:46.200]  the, uh, the crystals,
[06:46.200 --> 06:50.600]  the high cannabinoid full spectrum extract and one gram of the liquid high
[06:50.600 --> 06:53.240]  terpene full spectrum extract together and mix it. He said,
[06:53.240 --> 06:56.480]  that's his favorite ratio. So I will try that later on.
[06:56.480 --> 07:00.080]  I happen to have two full grams and I know I've got more than one gram of the
[07:00.080 --> 07:04.880]  liquid, so I'll make that happen. Holy fuck. I'm rambling you guys.
[07:04.880 --> 07:08.240]  Thanks for joining me for a podcast. Number two 19. How did we get this far?
[07:09.680 --> 07:14.200]  Huh? All right. I need to slow down and I need to, uh,
[07:14.560 --> 07:17.160]  I know I'm going to start the show. It's a big rambles.
[07:17.160 --> 07:18.480]  And then we're going to go with some sad news,
[07:18.480 --> 07:21.080]  but then we're going to get to a listener email. Um,
[07:21.600 --> 07:23.720]  I want to give a shout out to somebody and, uh,
[07:23.760 --> 07:25.600]  give a moment of thanks to somebody.
[07:26.160 --> 07:28.280]  I don't want to make it sound like I was this guy's best friend.
[07:28.320 --> 07:32.360]  I knew him on Facebook. I met him a couple of times at events. Uh, we,
[07:32.400 --> 07:34.360]  I got to turn down the gain on this mic. That's too hot.
[07:34.360 --> 07:37.160]  You can hear my face clicking and shit. Here we go. Turn this down. Just touch.
[07:37.160 --> 07:40.400]  There we go. Take some gain off that bro. Put some reverb on there. All right.
[07:40.440 --> 07:42.640]  That should sound much better. Yeah. It sounds way better than the headphones.
[07:42.640 --> 07:46.120]  I apologize if I was kind of loud. Um, anyway, let me get back to where I was.
[07:46.760 --> 07:49.920]  There has been an activist in the cannabis community for many years.
[07:49.920 --> 07:52.600]  He is a strong supporter. He's been a loud voice.
[07:52.840 --> 07:56.480]  A lot of people think he's an asshole, but you know what people that, uh,
[07:56.960 --> 07:59.480]  make waves and do things are often thought of as assholes.
[07:59.480 --> 08:02.680]  People who speak up for themselves and others are often thought of as assholes.
[08:03.080 --> 08:03.320]  Uh,
[08:03.320 --> 08:07.960]  people that don't follow the normal everyday life and say what's on their mind
[08:07.960 --> 08:10.440]  instead of being a coward are often thought of as assholes.
[08:10.680 --> 08:13.040]  So a lot of people who are considered assholes,
[08:13.160 --> 08:14.760]  they kind of take pride in being thought of as an,
[08:14.840 --> 08:18.600]  and thought of as an asshole because they stand up for themselves and they're
[08:18.600 --> 08:22.040]  doing something. Um, somebody told me recently, yeah,
[08:22.040 --> 08:25.080]  I must be doing something right. A lot of people fucking hate me lately.
[08:25.080 --> 08:26.760]  And I just laughed at him. I was like, dude, you're killing it.
[08:26.760 --> 08:31.440]  That's why people hate you. This dude was one of cannabis is most hated.
[08:32.080 --> 08:33.760]  Uh, this, this guy's name was Mickey Martin.
[08:33.760 --> 08:37.480]  And I keep saying was because excuse me, I'm choking up from these dabs. Uh,
[08:37.520 --> 08:39.960]  Mickey passed away a couple of days ago here. I'm recording on a Friday.
[08:39.960 --> 08:42.680]  He just passed away a couple of days ago. I'm gonna give a shout out to Mickey
[08:42.720 --> 08:46.000]  Martin. Mickey Martin was a true fucking activist. Uh, he was a loud mouth.
[08:46.200 --> 08:49.360]  He was a pushy motherfucker. And that's what the cannabis scene needed.
[08:49.360 --> 08:52.400]  A lot of us are stoned and lazy and laid back. Uh,
[08:52.440 --> 08:56.080]  Mickey would smoke some dope and want to go preach the cannabis gospel to the
[08:56.080 --> 09:00.280]  people that don't believe. Uh, almost every picture I've seen of Mickey,
[09:00.280 --> 09:03.160]  he's got a bullhorn in one hand and a can of Coke in the other,
[09:03.200 --> 09:06.320]  or a can of Coke and a cigarette, or he's flipping off the camera.
[09:06.640 --> 09:09.760]  I was a bad-ass dude. He learned it from his bad-ass pops. Uh,
[09:09.800 --> 09:14.440]  the cannabis community, the cannabis army lost a leader, not just a soldier.
[09:14.440 --> 09:17.600]  We lost a fucking leader. So I want to give a shout out, uh,
[09:17.960 --> 09:21.040]  a very brief moment of silence. It's a podcast. We can't go too long,
[09:21.040 --> 09:25.120]  but I want to give a half a second of silence to Mickey Martin. So here it is.
[09:27.320 --> 09:30.680]  There we go. That's for Mickey Martin. Miss you, bro. See you up there.
[09:31.120 --> 09:33.240]  Smoke fat joint with you wherever we end up together.
[09:33.400 --> 09:37.720]  Cause we're going to the same place. Uh, Mickey ruffled a lot of feathers.
[09:37.720 --> 09:41.840]  Mickey did a thing called the fuck Mickey awards where he would pick people in
[09:41.840 --> 09:45.480]  the cannabis industry and troll the fuck out of them. Uh, he would get,
[09:45.480 --> 09:48.080]  I don't know. It's offensive. The, the awards were offensive,
[09:48.080 --> 09:52.920]  like most useless cannabis celebrity or most useless cannabis spokesperson.
[09:53.440 --> 09:56.000]  And he would just list people who, uh,
[09:56.000 --> 09:58.880]  I don't even want to say the names cause it was embarrassing of who he voted
[09:58.880 --> 10:03.000]  for winners. Uh, some of them were my friends occasionally, but people were,
[10:03.000 --> 10:05.840]  he was just trolled the shit out of people that he did not find worthy of their
[10:05.840 --> 10:10.080]  cannabis notoriety. He had beef with a lot of people. Uh, yeah,
[10:10.080 --> 10:12.520]  I was going to say the last I heard he had beef with a specific person.
[10:12.520 --> 10:16.680]  I don't want to talk out of my own lane. I'm not certain.
[10:16.680 --> 10:18.400]  So I don't want to be wrong. Anyway, shout out to Mickey Martin.
[10:19.040 --> 10:21.800]  Miss that motherfucker. It won't be the same going to events with Adam.
[10:21.800 --> 10:25.480]  There was a bullhorn yelling at people. All right, I'm going to move on.
[10:26.680 --> 10:28.680]  Uh, people have been asking about my breeding projects.
[10:28.680 --> 10:32.120]  I think I talked about it a little bit in the last episode,
[10:32.520 --> 10:35.720]  that breeding project. I think I spoke about pollinating the plants.
[10:35.880 --> 10:38.800]  On father's day, father's day has passed.
[10:38.800 --> 10:40.960]  It's been almost a week since father's day. So guess what?
[10:41.200 --> 10:45.440]  Those plants have been pollinated. I have two clones of the same male.
[10:45.440 --> 10:50.080]  So it's the same, excuse the throat clearing. I'm sorry. It's the same plant.
[10:50.120 --> 10:53.200]  There are two of them in there. One on one side of the room, one on the other.
[10:53.440 --> 10:57.240]  I've been doing my best not to let the pollen, uh, get to the female plants.
[10:57.640 --> 11:01.400]  So on the 18th, which was Sunday, which was father's day, I moved.
[11:01.400 --> 11:03.800]  I was the 19th, I guess one of those two days, God damn it.
[11:04.040 --> 11:07.640]  I moved the male plants, uh, one in the middle of all the other plants.
[11:08.000 --> 11:11.640]  And then one on the side of all the plants. And before I did it,
[11:11.840 --> 11:13.360]  I suited up real well. Uh,
[11:13.360 --> 11:16.040]  I wore clothes that I could just take off right away and throw into the washer.
[11:16.320 --> 11:19.240]  And then after I did it, I had to go wash my dreadlocks. You guys, I've got,
[11:19.240 --> 11:22.280]  I'm six foot five. I am seriously six feet, five inches tall.
[11:22.560 --> 11:26.840]  And I've got dreadlocks that go. One of them touches my knee.
[11:26.840 --> 11:30.640]  I like to say my dreadlocks go to my knees. One dreadlock touches my knee.
[11:30.920 --> 11:34.640]  They go to like mid thigh. They go past my ass. I sit on them. Uh,
[11:34.640 --> 11:38.240]  if I let them down in the car, they hang in the backseat of the car, uh,
[11:38.260 --> 11:42.240]  like on the floor, uh, they're all over. They're long. I got crazy dreadlocks.
[11:42.240 --> 11:45.120]  I had to, after I did the pollination, I had to go wash my dreads.
[11:45.120 --> 11:49.400]  I had to go hose down and to clean everything. Uh, but I digress. Uh,
[11:49.400 --> 11:52.840]  on the 18th, I went in there and I pollinated that room.
[11:52.880 --> 11:57.320]  So the arise male pollinated about 20 females.
[11:57.400 --> 12:00.160]  I went over the list last week. Let's see what I can remember right now.
[12:00.400 --> 12:05.400]  There is a redheaded stranger, which is Willie's wonder to an unknown Hayes,
[12:05.840 --> 12:07.480]  which I would assume would be sober Hayes.
[12:07.680 --> 12:09.120]  And I'm not certain that's the genetics of that.
[12:09.120 --> 12:12.920]  That's off the top of my head. There's a strain in there called prodad.
[12:13.320 --> 12:17.320]  Which is, I think is how I was told it's pronounced from ethos genetics. Uh,
[12:17.360 --> 12:20.480]  the reason I bred it to that is because of that strain smells like straight up
[12:20.520 --> 12:25.080]  oranges and grease. And I love the fucking smell, but it doesn't yield for shit.
[12:25.200 --> 12:28.560]  And I think that arise male will really increase the yield of that.
[12:29.480 --> 12:34.360]  Also in there is a grateful dog. There's hell's OG.
[12:34.840 --> 12:39.040]  There's Jeff's OG. There is Capelton. There's Kalonji Kush.
[12:39.800 --> 12:43.360]  There is white widow. And then I'm not sure what else is in there.
[12:43.360 --> 12:46.120]  I know there are a couple of others. There's a small platinum tangy plant.
[12:46.160 --> 12:49.080]  I've got a couple of small things that are being pollinated for the first time
[12:49.080 --> 12:52.320]  just to see what happens. I'll grow those seeds myself. If I like them,
[12:52.320 --> 12:53.880]  I'll make more, but anyhow,
[12:54.680 --> 12:56.760]  there's a bunch of new stuff coming up that I just made.
[12:56.760 --> 13:00.720]  That's how that breeding project is going. I can see the seeds developing.
[13:00.720 --> 13:04.640]  It's been just about a week and I can see the little seed pods happening.
[13:04.880 --> 13:06.640]  I posted a couple of pictures to my Instagram.
[13:06.640 --> 13:10.240]  If you want to check out the Instagram, it's IRI underscore genetics.
[13:10.280 --> 13:14.480]  I R I E underscore genetics on Instagram. Check that out.
[13:15.280 --> 13:15.960]  But these plants,
[13:15.960 --> 13:20.520]  these seeds are going to need like six weeks ish to mature and harden up.
[13:20.920 --> 13:24.360]  And then I'll harvest them. And then the plants need to dry. And then, uh,
[13:24.360 --> 13:26.840]  it's just me. And sometimes miss Jenny Beth comes in,
[13:26.840 --> 13:31.880]  helps me pull seeds out of plants. So thanks for doing that, JB. Uh, but, uh,
[13:31.920 --> 13:32.200]  yeah,
[13:32.200 --> 13:35.600]  it's going to be a minute before anybody gets any of those because I'm probably
[13:35.600 --> 13:38.680]  going to keep most of the Kalonji and the Capel Cinder brand new,
[13:38.840 --> 13:42.160]  the red headed stranger and the Prodagium are brand new.
[13:42.520 --> 13:43.440]  Most of those are brand new.
[13:43.440 --> 13:45.840]  So I'm going to hoard them myself and grow most of them myself.
[13:45.840 --> 13:48.480]  Cause that's just what I like to do with the first batch,
[13:48.760 --> 13:51.360]  but I'll let you know how they go. I'll let you know when they start hardening up,
[13:51.400 --> 13:53.600]  I'll give, I'll keep you posted. And then when I grow them,
[13:53.720 --> 13:55.440]  I will certainly keep you posted on there,
[13:56.480 --> 14:00.240]  which allows me to move forward a little bit. A long time ago,
[14:00.240 --> 14:05.000]  I talked about the breeding project where I used to rise and I crossed that to
[14:05.000 --> 14:06.640]  flow and white widow.
[14:07.480 --> 14:11.240]  I may have talked about germinating those recently. Also they have sprouted,
[14:11.280 --> 14:15.200]  they are in dirt. They are in a solo cups with dirt.
[14:15.520 --> 14:19.440]  I'm going to run the entire run in solo cups. I know that sounds strange,
[14:19.440 --> 14:23.080]  but I put a certain amount of solo cups in this Tupperware dish that I've got.
[14:23.080 --> 14:26.440]  They fit perfectly. And then what I do is I just,
[14:26.520 --> 14:28.960]  I poke holes in the bottom of the solo cups, plenty of holes.
[14:28.960 --> 14:31.920]  There's plenty of drainage. Uh, and I fill,
[14:31.920 --> 14:35.960]  I water the reservoir and the water wicks up into the soil and the plants stay
[14:35.960 --> 14:40.240]  fed and nutriented and happy. So I put the seeds into the soil.
[14:40.400 --> 14:42.480]  They have grown. They're starting to sprout out.
[14:42.720 --> 14:46.000]  There may be like a half inch tall. They're like one knuckle tall.
[14:46.520 --> 14:48.720]  They're just a little itty bitty baby sprouts right now.
[14:49.040 --> 14:51.080]  And some of them are just starting to come up.
[14:51.080 --> 14:53.280]  So something that I have thought of, uh,
[14:53.320 --> 14:56.240]  I thought that I should share with you that is a good idea that I've been doing
[14:56.640 --> 14:59.560]  when I was a new grower, I would germinate my seeds.
[14:59.640 --> 15:02.040]  Then I would put them into dirt and then I would water them.
[15:02.040 --> 15:04.920]  And the seed would go fucking flying around in the cup somewhere with that
[15:04.920 --> 15:06.480]  water and end up in a random spot.
[15:06.840 --> 15:11.840]  Sometimes you'd get a cup of soil or a pot of dirt with a plant growing way off
[15:11.880 --> 15:13.440]  to one side, because when you watered it,
[15:13.440 --> 15:15.920]  it just got washed away with the rainfall or with the flood.
[15:16.400 --> 15:19.120]  So now it's just randomly in there. So what I've started doing,
[15:20.120 --> 15:22.440]  I have my germinated seed. That's just got, you know,
[15:22.440 --> 15:25.560]  maybe a half inch little tail sticking off of it. I fill my,
[15:25.600 --> 15:27.000]  whatever it's going into. If it's a pot,
[15:27.000 --> 15:30.080]  I prefer a small cup because some of these are going to get cold.
[15:30.080 --> 15:32.200]  Some are going to survive. It's a small plant.
[15:32.200 --> 15:35.520]  You don't need to water a whole bunch of soil to keep a small plant alive.
[15:35.520 --> 15:38.520]  So I put a seedling into a beer cup or a six inch net pot,
[15:38.520 --> 15:40.880]  sometimes a five inch net pot. Uh,
[15:40.920 --> 15:43.840]  I like to use just very well aerated soil.
[15:44.000 --> 15:47.040]  I don't need too much amendments because I feed them well on my own.
[15:47.440 --> 15:51.200]  So I put a, I make a, just an indention about one knuckle deep.
[15:51.200 --> 15:52.600]  And that's the second time I said knuckle deep.
[15:52.600 --> 15:54.360]  I'll try not to say that again on the podcast.
[15:54.560 --> 15:58.160]  I make an indention about that far with my finger into the soil.
[15:58.160 --> 16:01.080]  And then I set the ceiling in there and then I just press a little bit of dirt
[16:01.080 --> 16:03.000]  over it. Just kind of backfill it real gently.
[16:03.440 --> 16:07.280]  And then I use my spray bottle that I have one,
[16:07.480 --> 16:10.400]  I have a spray bottle of pump sprayer that is used for pesticides.
[16:10.400 --> 16:14.040]  And I have a pump sprayer that is used for non pesticide products like foliar
[16:14.040 --> 16:17.400]  feeds. Like if I want to feed with push or if I want to do something that just
[16:17.400 --> 16:20.520]  is, I've got one with an X on it, which is for bug sprays and bad.
[16:20.520 --> 16:23.160]  And I've got one that doesn't is not marked, which is for cool stuff.
[16:23.480 --> 16:26.200]  But I like to rinse my plants with just clean water. Also.
[16:26.200 --> 16:30.880]  Sometimes if I spray them with pesticide, sometimes specific pesticides,
[16:30.880 --> 16:33.440]  I will rinse it off later. Anyhow,
[16:33.800 --> 16:36.360]  I will take the clean sprayer and I'll just put clean water in it,
[16:36.360 --> 16:39.120]  or I'll put a little light nutrient solution in there and I'll pH it.
[16:39.600 --> 16:42.480]  And instead of watering the cups that have as fresh seedling in there,
[16:42.760 --> 16:45.280]  I will I'll water it first before I put the ceiling in there.
[16:45.280 --> 16:47.280]  Let me say that part, water it, make my indention,
[16:47.280 --> 16:50.720]  put the ceiling in their backfill it. Uh, then it'll probably dry.
[16:51.200 --> 16:52.480]  It'll probably take 24,
[16:52.480 --> 16:55.840]  maybe 48 hours for that soil to dry before you'll need to water it again.
[16:55.880 --> 16:58.760]  That's when I take the pump sprayer and I don't want to blast it,
[16:58.760 --> 17:01.760]  but I want it to come from above just like rain. Because if you think about it,
[17:02.120 --> 17:05.040]  the water that you're going to get on your seedlings and nature would fall from
[17:05.040 --> 17:08.440]  above. So I use the pump sprayer to spray it from above,
[17:08.600 --> 17:12.280]  making it like it's raining. I make it rain onto my little seedlings.
[17:12.680 --> 17:16.120]  And what I've seen that do the ceilings are trying to poke out of the soil,
[17:16.120 --> 17:18.760]  right? Sometimes they're bent over. They're over like,
[17:19.520 --> 17:22.320]  like a 180 degree turn. Part of them will be growing straight up,
[17:22.320 --> 17:26.480]  but that first little set of sprouts is stuck on the soil and it can't pop up.
[17:26.840 --> 17:29.640]  I've noticed when the raindrops essentially land on it,
[17:29.880 --> 17:34.040]  it pushes that dirt off of that first set of sprout leaves and they pop up like
[17:34.060 --> 17:37.720]  little springs. So if you've got some seedlings that won't pop up instead of,
[17:37.720 --> 17:40.320]  I've used my finger to get in there and pull them up and I've completely killed
[17:40.320 --> 17:41.400]  them and fucked them up before.
[17:41.880 --> 17:46.200]  I just spray them with a little bit of water lightly will move that soil down
[17:46.320 --> 17:48.160]  and it's moist enough to where it makes the water.
[17:48.200 --> 17:51.440]  It makes the soil push right off of that leaf and that fucker just pops right up.
[17:51.440 --> 17:54.840]  It's a really cool technique and it also won't disrupt the soil so much.
[17:55.160 --> 17:57.960]  You can spray lightly. You can spray closer. You can spray from further away,
[17:57.960 --> 18:01.280]  just adjust your spray the way you need to and you won't ruin the seedlings.
[18:01.280 --> 18:04.960]  You can get the soil plenty wet. And also if you're OCD and you're weird,
[18:05.240 --> 18:08.720]  you can spray downward and it pushes all the soil off the ridge of the cup back
[18:08.720 --> 18:11.040]  into the pot or off the edge of the cut back into the cup,
[18:11.040 --> 18:13.080]  into the surface of the soil and it makes it look nice and clean.
[18:13.100 --> 18:16.960]  You don't have loose soil stuck to your cups. Just a side bonus. All right.
[18:17.420 --> 18:19.720]  I do have an email that I promised you I would read.
[18:20.960 --> 18:23.360]  Let me see if they want me to say their name. They say their name in the email,
[18:23.360 --> 18:26.160]  but I'm not going to read it because I'm not sure if they want to or if they
[18:26.180 --> 18:29.800]  wanted me to. The email goes like this.
[18:29.820 --> 18:32.520]  And if you want me to read your email on a show, send me an email.
[18:32.520 --> 18:36.320]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com. I get a lot of emails.
[18:36.320 --> 18:39.000]  I'm filtering through them. Like I said, in a previous episode,
[18:39.000 --> 18:42.400]  I bought myself a printer. It's wireless. Welcome to the future.
[18:42.680 --> 18:44.960]  And I can print my emails just straight from my phone.
[18:44.960 --> 18:46.040]  So if I'm sitting somewhere,
[18:46.560 --> 18:48.800]  just imagine where I might be sitting somewhere checking my emails.
[18:48.800 --> 18:49.720]  I won't fill you in on that.
[18:49.720 --> 18:52.560]  But if I'm sitting there and my legs are going numb and I'm checking my emails,
[18:52.560 --> 18:54.640]  I can just shoot the email right to my printer.
[18:54.680 --> 18:56.600]  And then when I come into come to do a podcast,
[18:56.600 --> 18:58.680]  I scoop up all those emails. I read through a few of them.
[18:58.680 --> 19:02.040]  And like that's the one I wanted to do. And I do kind of in order to,
[19:02.280 --> 19:03.920]  maybe something that I was doing at work,
[19:03.920 --> 19:06.560]  maybe your email matched up with something that was on my mind.
[19:06.760 --> 19:09.040]  That's just how they usually get read or order of importance.
[19:09.040 --> 19:10.120]  If you send me one that's like, Hey,
[19:10.120 --> 19:12.960]  you got to read this right now and it's actually very time pertinent.
[19:13.000 --> 19:16.360]  It would go first, but I'm fucking rambling today to firm,
[19:16.360 --> 19:19.760]  all these dabs and caffeine. And yeah, let's get into this email,
[19:20.400 --> 19:21.560]  which is something that I do.
[19:21.560 --> 19:23.920]  It's about something I do on a daily basis.
[19:23.920 --> 19:26.000]  And I've been trying to teach the crew a little bit more.
[19:26.000 --> 19:28.120]  And I've also been learning more about through experience.
[19:29.400 --> 19:33.400]  Let's talk about it. It says, Hey, I'm going to say my name is,
[19:33.400 --> 19:36.120]  but I'm going to skip the name. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to say it.
[19:36.240 --> 19:38.160]  It says I found your podcast about a week ago.
[19:38.160 --> 19:41.880]  Got to say it's now one of my top podcasts I listened to.
[19:41.880 --> 19:45.000]  I'm still getting caught up. I'm from a non-legal state, sadly,
[19:45.440 --> 19:49.640]  not many people to get knowledge from around here. So I had a question.
[19:49.640 --> 19:53.960]  I was wanting to run by you if you have the time. So since I'm just making sure,
[19:53.960 --> 19:55.680]  the computer doesn't freeze it froze a moment ago,
[19:55.920 --> 19:59.000]  trying to look at the email and look at the screen we're rolling. Uh, since,
[19:59.360 --> 20:01.600]  since I have to grow stealthily space is limited.
[20:01.800 --> 20:05.280]  So I was curious on your thoughts on using a trellis and doing the canopy of
[20:05.280 --> 20:10.000]  green technique, I believe was called. I've read that it can help yield more.
[20:10.160 --> 20:13.040]  Okay. Using the canopy of green technique. I believe it was called.
[20:13.040 --> 20:15.680]  I've read that it can help yield more. And then it goes on to say,
[20:15.920 --> 20:17.760]  I was thinking of trying it on my next harvest.
[20:17.760 --> 20:20.640]  I'm currently working on my very first harvest and I'm in flower.
[20:20.640 --> 20:24.280]  I just wanted your opinion on using a trellis or any tips you'd like to give a
[20:24.280 --> 20:28.200]  newbie. I'm learning a lot from your show as well. Keep up the good work, brother.
[20:28.640 --> 20:33.280]  Thanks for the awesome podcast, man. Helps me get through my 10 hour shift.
[20:34.120 --> 20:38.600]  Hey, thanks for the email, man. I really appreciate that. Uh, 10 hour shift.
[20:38.600 --> 20:40.800]  Holy shit. What are you doing, bro? And also, uh,
[20:40.840 --> 20:42.360]  thanks for listening to the old episodes.
[20:42.400 --> 20:45.760]  I hope you are listening to the throwback Thursday episodes that I put out.
[20:46.240 --> 20:49.320]  Uh, if you guys haven't caught on on Thursdays, I call it throwback Thursday.
[20:49.320 --> 20:52.160]  I put out chunks of old episodes. There's usually three episodes.
[20:52.160 --> 20:55.200]  It's like a three hour, uh, show just in one download.
[20:55.680 --> 20:59.800]  A lot of the old episodes had a lot of long, uh, written out content.
[21:00.200 --> 21:02.640]  It felt now when I listened to it, it feels really weird.
[21:02.640 --> 21:06.120]  It feels more like a school lesson, but a lot of you guys love that.
[21:06.120 --> 21:09.280]  So let me know if you're listening to those. I hope you're catching those.
[21:10.240 --> 21:13.800]  I'm glad I can help you out in your non-legal state, but be careful. Uh,
[21:13.880 --> 21:18.200]  be very careful. So I want to get into your question. Uh,
[21:18.200 --> 21:21.840]  you're saying spit and this is a very good idea. Yes. My short answer. Yes.
[21:21.840 --> 21:24.040]  Do this. But now of course it's me.
[21:24.060 --> 21:27.240]  So I have to give a long drawn out answer just because that's how I do shit.
[21:27.600 --> 21:29.120]  So you're asking about, uh,
[21:29.120 --> 21:32.200]  I know it as a screen of green or a trellising technique.
[21:32.440 --> 21:34.120]  And you say you've got limited space.
[21:34.380 --> 21:37.600]  So this will be very helpful for you in limited space. Uh,
[21:37.600 --> 21:41.760]  I have got nearly unlimited space and this is a technique that I utilize in a
[21:41.760 --> 21:44.520]  commercial growth. So this is very recommended. Uh,
[21:44.560 --> 21:47.400]  this is called the sea of green or the screen of green technique.
[21:47.440 --> 21:48.960]  A sea of green, in my opinion,
[21:49.320 --> 21:53.480]  is more when you do a bunch of small plants that are just one Cola and it's just
[21:53.480 --> 21:54.480]  a sea of Colas.
[21:54.800 --> 21:58.760]  The screen of green in my opinion is when you use trellising or chicken wire or
[21:58.760 --> 21:59.600]  something similar.
[21:59.960 --> 22:03.240]  And all of my descriptions will be using trellising that you buy from the
[22:03.240 --> 22:07.600]  growth store or wherever you get it. But it's just trellising designed for plants.
[22:07.600 --> 22:10.360]  It's either six inch squares or three and a half inch squares.
[22:10.360 --> 22:12.600]  You can buy it in lots of different sizes.
[22:12.840 --> 22:17.520]  I like to buy the either five or six foot wide, uh, by like 30,
[22:17.520 --> 22:21.240]  60 or 120 feet long because we do long sections. Uh,
[22:21.280 --> 22:25.600]  but that's the stuff I'll be talking about. You can use plastic stuff.
[22:25.600 --> 22:29.440]  You can use harder stuff. I don't like to use the rigid stuff. For me,
[22:29.440 --> 22:31.120]  I fuck up more plants. Uh,
[22:31.140 --> 22:34.320]  using the screen can be a little hard the first time getting it unraveled,
[22:34.340 --> 22:37.560]  figuring out how to get it set up there. That can be a bitch the first time.
[22:37.560 --> 22:39.680]  But once you figure it out, it's real easy.
[22:40.360 --> 22:44.760]  So now let's actually talk a little bit about the screen of green method and how
[22:44.760 --> 22:49.760]  and why it's used and how it will help increase your yields and why I use it,
[22:49.920 --> 22:52.600]  I guess, basically. So the screen of green method,
[22:52.800 --> 22:55.680]  one thing it can really do is help you reduce your plant numbers.
[22:55.680 --> 22:59.000]  Because instead of using a bunch of plants to fill some space,
[22:59.000 --> 23:00.800]  you can use less plants,
[23:00.820 --> 23:02.160]  depending on the amount of space you have,
[23:02.160 --> 23:04.120]  the size pots you're using and how much time you've got.
[23:04.360 --> 23:09.280]  You can use less plants to fill the same amount of square footage because instead
[23:09.280 --> 23:10.800]  of the plant growing straight up,
[23:10.880 --> 23:14.520]  you'll be bending the plant and all of that straight up growth is going to go
[23:14.520 --> 23:16.600]  left, right, North, South, East, West.
[23:16.600 --> 23:19.920]  You'll spread it out in every direction and you'll fill the space.
[23:20.320 --> 23:25.320]  That is the main goal of the first trellis. When I use a trellising system,
[23:25.320 --> 23:29.800]  I usually set up at least two trellis nets, sometimes three,
[23:29.800 --> 23:33.360]  just depending on what strain I'm running and how big the plants have gotten.
[23:33.680 --> 23:35.040]  So when you're setting up a trellis,
[23:35.320 --> 23:37.680]  here are a couple of things to think about from the very beginning.
[23:38.280 --> 23:41.040]  You're going to need somewhere to anchor the trellis net.
[23:41.040 --> 23:44.600]  You need to pull this thing fairly tight, especially the first layer.
[23:44.600 --> 23:46.840]  The first layer is going to be holding the plant down.
[23:47.080 --> 23:50.320]  The plant's going to want to pop up from there. It needs to be anchored very well.
[23:50.560 --> 23:54.920]  So a lot of times in my case, I'm working with like a botanic care tray or a table.
[23:54.920 --> 23:58.520]  So let's just say you've got a four by four or a five by five table,
[23:58.520 --> 24:02.120]  a four by four botanic care table, a four by four botanic care tray with like
[24:02.120 --> 24:03.680]  nine, uh,
[24:03.880 --> 24:08.080]  three gallon pots in there and your plants are about 18 inches tall and you've
[24:08.080 --> 24:09.880]  got the table up off the ground a little bit.
[24:10.080 --> 24:14.880]  Now you want to build, I would build a frame out of PVC piping. Uh,
[24:14.920 --> 24:18.640]  just I would make the base five feet by five feet, just a square.
[24:19.000 --> 24:21.280]  And then I would make another five by five square.
[24:21.520 --> 24:24.520]  And I would attach those together with six foot poles in the middle.
[24:24.520 --> 24:29.160]  So you've got a five by five by six. Uh, it's a rectangle, it's a box,
[24:29.200 --> 24:30.040]  it's a cube.
[24:30.280 --> 24:34.560]  And basically what you're going to use that for is for attaching the trellis in
[24:34.560 --> 24:37.400]  multiple layers. So if you've got your four by four table,
[24:37.440 --> 24:39.200]  you've got a five by five square around it.
[24:39.440 --> 24:41.440]  You got to pull around near each corner,
[24:41.480 --> 24:44.160]  like about a foot out from each corner, right? It goes up.
[24:44.200 --> 24:47.480]  Then six feet above maybe five and a half feet, depending on your growth,
[24:47.480 --> 24:49.840]  depending on how much space you have, do it as tall as you need to.
[24:50.520 --> 24:53.840]  We do ours at the commercial grow at five and a half and six feet because the
[24:53.840 --> 24:56.840]  fans are at six feet. So that's, that's my go-to,
[24:56.840 --> 24:59.200]  but maybe you only need four feet. Maybe you only need three feet.
[24:59.480 --> 25:00.880]  It depends on what style you're growing.
[25:00.880 --> 25:03.280]  So you've got your plants on the table.
[25:03.280 --> 25:05.080]  You've got this square around the table.
[25:05.760 --> 25:10.080]  I would take the first set of net and attach each corner so that you've got a
[25:10.080 --> 25:14.760]  nice square square. It's there's no bumps. There's no lumps. Every,
[25:15.240 --> 25:16.520]  you've got a perfect grid.
[25:16.560 --> 25:20.640]  The line that starts on the pole on the right is the same line of string that
[25:20.640 --> 25:23.600]  ends on the pole on the left to make sure you've got those squares. Perfect.
[25:23.600 --> 25:25.840]  I know it sounds crazy, but you want to pull it tight.
[25:25.840 --> 25:29.240]  And if you don't have it straight, it won't pull tight. It'll be crooked.
[25:29.320 --> 25:31.800]  When your squares are off, that's messing the whole,
[25:31.840 --> 25:34.240]  missing the whole point of this whole technique. So get it tight.
[25:35.240 --> 25:38.720]  This is going to be pulling your plant down this net.
[25:39.040 --> 25:43.520]  The whole purpose of the first trellis is to stop the plants from growing up and
[25:43.520 --> 25:47.320]  to make them grow sideways, like left and right, like horizontally.
[25:47.600 --> 25:50.120]  So you'll take this first net. And like I said earlier,
[25:50.120 --> 25:52.080]  the plants are approximately 18 inches tall.
[25:52.680 --> 25:54.840]  Put this net right at the 18 inch mark.
[25:54.880 --> 25:56.160]  Now I don't know if you've topped your plants.
[25:56.160 --> 25:57.560]  I don't know if you haven't topped the plants.
[25:57.560 --> 25:58.880]  You may have a whole bunch of tops.
[25:59.200 --> 26:01.960]  You may have just one glory bud going on so far,
[26:02.280 --> 26:06.360]  but this net now is going to stop these plants from growing any taller for a
[26:06.360 --> 26:06.840]  little while.
[26:06.840 --> 26:10.520]  You want them at this 18 inch mark for until you fill out the screen,
[26:10.800 --> 26:14.120]  the plants are going to grow and they're going to go into the net.
[26:14.520 --> 26:18.920]  Now you've got to grab the plant and bend it over and stick it back under the net
[26:19.040 --> 26:20.400]  and make it grow sideways.
[26:20.600 --> 26:23.920]  And you want to keep doing this until you fill in that canopy.
[26:23.920 --> 26:27.880]  So think about this. The plant's going to grow. You're bending it to the right.
[26:28.520 --> 26:31.840]  Usually it makes those little tiny shoots off the side of that branch, right?
[26:31.960 --> 26:35.520]  You've just bent it over. Those are going to grow up in a few days.
[26:35.520 --> 26:38.840]  You're going to need to grab those little branches and tuck those underneath the
[26:38.840 --> 26:41.600]  screen. So you've got wires running left and right.
[26:42.000 --> 26:45.760]  Your whole goal eventually is to have one, one branch,
[26:45.760 --> 26:49.360]  one little bud site coming up out of each section of the screen.
[26:49.360 --> 26:53.720]  So every three and a half or six inch section will have one growth arm coming
[26:53.720 --> 26:57.200]  out of there. So for the first couple of weeks,
[26:57.200 --> 26:58.440]  you're going to put that trellis on there.
[26:58.480 --> 27:00.840]  I'm not sure how long you're going to let the trellis go before you flower.
[27:01.120 --> 27:04.320]  We'll say a week, put the trellis on there. The plant will grow into it.
[27:04.560 --> 27:05.440]  You start bending it.
[27:05.760 --> 27:09.120]  The plant's going to get bent over and then it'll start growing back up.
[27:09.520 --> 27:13.000]  You just want to grab it and put it under another part of the trellis and it may,
[27:13.000 --> 27:16.640]  it'll start growing back up. This plant wants to grow up. It's got,
[27:16.760 --> 27:20.240]  it's got hormones in it that tell it to go up. That's why it's got a top.
[27:20.720 --> 27:24.400]  And it wants to compete for a top. It wants to have one dominant cola,
[27:24.440 --> 27:25.960]  but we keep putting it down.
[27:26.000 --> 27:30.000]  So all of the branches are going to try to grow up and they all have an option to
[27:30.000 --> 27:33.200]  be a dominant cola. So they're all going to fight for that position.
[27:33.520 --> 27:36.360]  So every time you pull one down, it's going to try to go back up.
[27:37.040 --> 27:40.080]  So you'll figure it out after a couple of pulling downs,
[27:40.400 --> 27:42.720]  how much the plant can take before you break part of it,
[27:43.200 --> 27:46.240]  how you're supposed to pull it down and bend it. It's pretty simple.
[27:46.240 --> 27:48.440]  Just put when the plant starts growing into the screen,
[27:48.720 --> 27:53.040]  just gently pull it down a little bit and put it under part of the screen.
[27:53.080 --> 27:54.960]  It'll go over and under, over and under,
[27:55.000 --> 27:56.520]  and just keep weaving that fucker through.
[27:56.920 --> 27:59.240]  And then as more parts grow and more parts grow,
[27:59.360 --> 28:02.800]  fill in every part of the screen until every square on that screen,
[28:02.800 --> 28:06.840]  or as least as much of that screen as you can is filled and then flower it.
[28:07.720 --> 28:10.400]  And then you're going to want to put another trellis on there, uh,
[28:10.440 --> 28:13.440]  somewhere between, and it depends on how much time you want to wait,
[28:13.680 --> 28:15.680]  how big you intend on getting these plants.
[28:16.000 --> 28:17.840]  There are several factors to think about right now,
[28:17.840 --> 28:21.360]  but somewhere between eight and 16, maybe eight and 18 more inches,
[28:21.680 --> 28:23.640]  put another screen. Uh,
[28:23.720 --> 28:26.520]  and this screen is going to support your colas.
[28:26.840 --> 28:29.280]  You don't want to get in there with a bunch of sticks and shove a bunch of
[28:29.280 --> 28:30.080]  sticks into pots.
[28:30.080 --> 28:33.680]  We're not trying to use that many sticks and to grow this size and in a screen
[28:33.680 --> 28:35.240]  method. So put another trellis up.
[28:35.600 --> 28:38.480]  And that one's going to hold your donkey dick buds that start flopping over
[28:38.480 --> 28:41.320]  because you're going to have a whole sea of them.
[28:41.320 --> 28:45.880]  It's just going to be rows and rows left and right on a little grid of just big
[28:45.880 --> 28:48.440]  giant buds. So you need another screen on there.
[28:48.640 --> 28:51.320]  And that one is to hold them up. The first one is to spread it.
[28:51.720 --> 28:54.840]  And if you don't want to go extreme and use the screen to fill it out,
[28:55.120 --> 28:59.680]  you can use that just to pull them down a little bit and it'll just spread out
[28:59.680 --> 29:01.760]  the plant, the branches, and it'll make it,
[29:01.800 --> 29:04.560]  it'll make more of the inner branches grow. Cause you'll get more light.
[29:04.640 --> 29:07.880]  And we're going to talk a little bit more about getting more light to the parts
[29:07.880 --> 29:12.560]  of the screen also in just a minute. So get them grown, spread them out,
[29:12.560 --> 29:14.280]  get them growing. You'll start seeing them popping up.
[29:14.640 --> 29:17.840]  Once you have that canopy filled up, let them start popping up out of there.
[29:17.920 --> 29:21.520]  Put them into flower. Put that second trellis on there. Let me say something.
[29:21.520 --> 29:23.480]  Once you get them worked in there, how you want them,
[29:23.800 --> 29:26.600]  you've got to, uh, what my friend would say,
[29:26.800 --> 29:28.880]  give it a fucking chance to win somewhere.
[29:29.080 --> 29:30.800]  You're going to pull all these arms down and bend them.
[29:30.800 --> 29:34.280]  I'm using my own arm and hand as a visual aid here. You're going to pull,
[29:34.520 --> 29:36.360]  the arm's going to grow up. You're going to pull it down.
[29:36.400 --> 29:39.440]  It's going to try to go back up. I'm putting my hand up in an upward motion.
[29:40.000 --> 29:42.520]  Don't make that one struggle too hard at the very tip.
[29:42.560 --> 29:46.280]  Let the tips kind of grow up until they get long enough to get to another screen
[29:46.280 --> 29:50.040]  section and then put it down and make sure it's got a chance to grow up again
[29:50.200 --> 29:52.160]  and out of there. And don't flower it.
[29:52.160 --> 29:54.680]  If you've got some of them like struggle, but it tucked into there,
[29:54.680 --> 29:58.680]  let them kind of get stable before you do that. So get it growing,
[29:58.680 --> 30:02.480]  fill in that canopy as much as you feel like you need to put it into flower,
[30:02.680 --> 30:06.320]  let it grow into that second canopy, which could be anywhere from like six,
[30:06.320 --> 30:10.600]  eight, 10, maybe 18 inches up above, depending on how long, what size pot,
[30:10.640 --> 30:14.120]  hydro flat hydro soil, cocoa, depends on what you're doing,
[30:14.720 --> 30:16.240]  but get that next trellis up there.
[30:16.240 --> 30:18.440]  That one is to hold all those buds from falling over.
[30:18.800 --> 30:21.800]  If you're growing something like blueberry headband or Jack flash,
[30:21.800 --> 30:24.800]  you may need a third trellis. If you're growing super lemon Hays,
[30:24.960 --> 30:26.280]  you may need a third trellis.
[30:26.280 --> 30:29.560]  That's why I told you to make those poles six feet tall in my grow.
[30:29.760 --> 30:30.960]  The poles are six feet tall.
[30:30.960 --> 30:35.440]  And right now the blueberry headband is fucking grown way past those poles and
[30:35.440 --> 30:37.920]  they're in flower and they're only there about five weeks.
[30:37.920 --> 30:40.880]  They still got three or four weeks to go. They're going to be fucking savages,
[30:40.880 --> 30:42.800]  but put that third trellis on there.
[30:42.800 --> 30:45.760]  That's simply to support the gigantic buds that'll be growing.
[30:45.760 --> 30:48.040]  You want them to stay tall. Once they start flowering,
[30:48.040 --> 30:49.440]  you don't want to bend them over too far.
[30:49.800 --> 30:54.200]  One thing you can do at the beginning of the flowering phase or late into the
[30:54.200 --> 30:57.160]  veg phase. If one little section is getting taller,
[30:57.160 --> 31:00.120]  one branch is trying to be a bastard and grow taller than everything else.
[31:00.640 --> 31:02.440]  Give it a twist between your fingers.
[31:02.840 --> 31:06.880]  Just give it a twist and let it turn and squeeze it until it kind of cracks and
[31:06.880 --> 31:09.920]  then just bend it over. And I know I'm never going to say,
[31:09.920 --> 31:13.280]  just bend it over again like that. Just break it off. Don't break it off.
[31:13.280 --> 31:14.800]  Just bend it over is what you really need to do.
[31:15.040 --> 31:19.760]  Bend it over so that it's not as tall and then it'll slowly grow back up and
[31:19.760 --> 31:22.760]  you're just going to kind of slow it from growing up and make it grow vertically
[31:22.960 --> 31:25.560]  and it'll get a little knuckle right there. It'll get a little tougher.
[31:25.840 --> 31:30.840]  And we're going to talk more about knuckles and popping in just a second here.
[31:31.040 --> 31:34.520]  So you've got your first trellis on, you want to have your plants growing.
[31:35.040 --> 31:39.360]  A lot of people will take that first trellis and they'll lay it on top of the
[31:39.360 --> 31:43.840]  plant and push kind of hard to make it go down, which I am not opposed to.
[31:44.240 --> 31:47.200]  If you have the time, you'd put the trellis up and let the plant grow into it.
[31:47.200 --> 31:49.520]  If you don't have the time, force them down a little bit.
[31:49.520 --> 31:52.320]  You can pull those arms down. If you've already got the plant grown,
[31:52.680 --> 31:55.880]  you can pull the arms and branches down and spread them out.
[31:55.920 --> 31:59.520]  You can get those fuckers nice and spread out and horizontal,
[32:00.400 --> 32:01.240]  horizontal, right? Yes.
[32:01.240 --> 32:05.240]  You can get them way more horizontal than you can vertical and you'll be amazed
[32:05.240 --> 32:07.960]  at how much horizontal space you can get. So if you've got low ceilings,
[32:07.960 --> 32:09.040]  this is definitely helpful.
[32:09.040 --> 32:12.560]  This is a great way to use low ceilings and use more space.
[32:13.120 --> 32:15.440]  Um, so you've got the first one stretching them out.
[32:15.440 --> 32:17.720]  You've got the second one supporting them and you've got the third one there
[32:17.840 --> 32:19.720]  for those giant, giant buds.
[32:19.960 --> 32:24.960]  Your goal is to have one top per square to maximize the space vertically and
[32:25.240 --> 32:27.520]  horizontally. Think about this.
[32:28.080 --> 32:30.280]  Let's just say that this person who wrote this email,
[32:30.280 --> 32:32.960]  his grow room is six feet by six feet square.
[32:33.160 --> 32:36.640]  He's got 1000 watt light hanging from the center of the ceiling.
[32:37.160 --> 32:40.640]  The air is handled. The air conditioning as well. The ventilation as well.
[32:40.640 --> 32:42.520]  He's got air exchange happening. Temperatures are cool.
[32:42.520 --> 32:43.680]  That's not our concern right now.
[32:44.080 --> 32:47.560]  So he's got this four by four table that's raised up a little bit.
[32:47.560 --> 32:51.640]  So it's work level. Uh, then he's got this five by five trellis on it.
[32:52.200 --> 32:57.200]  The idea is to fill that grow space and that light area with as much bud as you
[32:57.880 --> 33:01.320]  can produce to make it cost effective and worth your time.
[33:01.640 --> 33:04.240]  And if you were in a place where it's not legal to grow,
[33:04.480 --> 33:08.440]  you need to make it worth your ass because you could end up in prison.
[33:08.440 --> 33:10.680]  So you need every fucking gram you can get out of it.
[33:10.680 --> 33:13.880]  Cause if you're going to do it, fucking do it. You got to pay for electricity.
[33:13.880 --> 33:17.040]  You may have to pay for a lawyer. I hope you don't have to do any lawyer shit,
[33:17.040 --> 33:19.440]  but you just, there may be costs.
[33:19.440 --> 33:23.080]  So you need to make everything you can if you're in an illegal state. I get that.
[33:23.880 --> 33:28.560]  So think about spreading it out and getting as much light as you can into this
[33:28.560 --> 33:32.160]  square area and getting as much bud as you can in that square area.
[33:32.440 --> 33:36.080]  So when you're spreading out the plants and putting one bud per square,
[33:36.520 --> 33:41.520]  you were putting as much bud from top to bottom in that space as you can.
[33:42.360 --> 33:45.240]  And also from left to right in that space as you can.
[33:45.240 --> 33:49.760]  Now keep in mind that the light will only penetrate depending on what kind of
[33:49.760 --> 33:51.160]  light you've got. If you've got a Govita,
[33:51.200 --> 33:53.680]  maybe you'll get three feet of penetration. I'm really not sure.
[33:53.680 --> 33:55.400]  Those things are fucking savage beasts.
[33:55.680 --> 33:58.680]  If you've got just a normal single ended HPS bulb,
[33:58.880 --> 34:01.880]  you're only going to get about 18 inches of good light penetration.
[34:02.240 --> 34:05.880]  So you want to get it to where you've got 18 inches of buds.
[34:05.880 --> 34:08.680]  You want 18 inch tall colas. You want more than that, honestly,
[34:08.680 --> 34:10.080]  if they're going to grow taller, let them,
[34:10.400 --> 34:14.520]  but you want at least 18 inch tall colas in every single square of that
[34:14.520 --> 34:17.520]  trellis. And they're going to look nice and uniform. It's going to be awesome.
[34:17.800 --> 34:22.480]  One thing to make that work is only do one strain in that room or do one strain
[34:22.480 --> 34:24.520]  per table. Or if you're going to trellis,
[34:24.540 --> 34:28.400]  do one strain per section or something, because I know from experience,
[34:28.400 --> 34:32.560]  it is a pain in the ass trying to trellis a tray with multiple strains.
[34:32.560 --> 34:35.880]  You'll have Jack flash. And what else would you have next to it?
[34:35.880 --> 34:39.800]  Platinum tangy fucking Jack flash grows big and tall platinum tangy just grows
[34:39.800 --> 34:40.800]  like short and stout.
[34:41.140 --> 34:44.800]  It's hard to trellis them next to each other because then your trellis is like
[34:45.040 --> 34:46.600]  18 inches off the canopy in one part.
[34:46.600 --> 34:49.640]  Then you got to make it go 24 off the next part just to make it fit that one
[34:49.640 --> 34:52.960]  fucking plant in there. It's hard to deal with. So stick with one strain.
[34:53.720 --> 34:58.600]  Once you've got things trellised and it looks good things I would recommend
[34:58.600 --> 35:02.640]  in there to increase your yield and also just increase the health of the plants
[35:02.800 --> 35:06.640]  are some defoliation. Take off the big fan leaves that you don't need.
[35:06.640 --> 35:10.960]  Take off big fan leaves that you feel you do need early in flower all the way up
[35:10.960 --> 35:13.640]  to like week four. I feel like you could just pull the shit out of leaves.
[35:13.640 --> 35:17.040]  You can clean off those bottom sucker buds, clean them up, defoliate them,
[35:17.040 --> 35:21.480]  take all that shit off of there. When you're vegging in the veg phase,
[35:21.720 --> 35:24.880]  and also early in flower, I'll do this up to week three and flower.
[35:25.200 --> 35:29.440]  I like to do what's known as super cropping or just popping the sticks.
[35:29.800 --> 35:32.680]  I will grab, and I do this all the way from the base of the plant.
[35:32.680 --> 35:35.680]  And I work my way all the way up until that's too skinny to even do it.
[35:36.240 --> 35:40.120]  I take, and I've also lollipop this shit out of my plants.
[35:40.120 --> 35:41.720]  I take off all the small branches.
[35:41.720 --> 35:45.560]  If it's not like the size of a pencil or at least as big around as my dabber,
[35:45.760 --> 35:48.440]  I cut that branch off the plant because I don't fucking need that.
[35:48.480 --> 35:50.880]  I need these big healthy branches. I need the winners.
[35:51.240 --> 35:55.000]  I want like eight to 10 big fat branches per plant so that I can screen them out
[35:55.000 --> 35:59.520]  real well. But I go up the plant and I just pop them. I hold part of the plant,
[35:59.560 --> 36:02.160]  part of the branch with my right hand, part of the branch with my left hand.
[36:02.160 --> 36:05.440]  And I just turn different directions, kind of like I'm going to do an Indian burn,
[36:05.440 --> 36:08.560]  but I don't let go. And eventually the plant I'm going to do with my knuckle,
[36:08.560 --> 36:12.640]  it sounds just like this. The plant will do that. And that was my knuckle. Uh,
[36:12.680 --> 36:14.120]  and that's how you know you did it right.
[36:14.160 --> 36:16.960]  And that spot where you did that in a few days it'll make,
[36:17.320 --> 36:20.360]  it'll make to where it looks like a damn knuckle and it'll start to swell up.
[36:20.760 --> 36:21.480]  And I believe,
[36:21.480 --> 36:25.480]  and I think it's proven that those little sections make the plant stronger and
[36:25.480 --> 36:29.000]  they allow for more vascular action through the plant.
[36:29.000 --> 36:31.920]  They can move more nutrient to where they need to be.
[36:32.120 --> 36:34.880]  So it makes the plant stronger and it makes the plants bulkier.
[36:34.880 --> 36:36.480]  When you see them all knurled up like that,
[36:36.480 --> 36:39.040]  that's how you know people have been spending time loving those plants,
[36:39.320 --> 36:42.880]  making them branching. So defoliate heavily,
[36:43.160 --> 36:46.240]  take off all the bottom little ugly, funky buds that aren't going to make
[36:46.240 --> 36:48.880]  something. You don't need that shit on the bottom where the light's not getting.
[36:49.120 --> 36:51.600]  You don't need those skinny branches that are just going to have fucking
[36:51.600 --> 36:55.440]  dandelion buds instead of real buds. Take that off of there. Let that energy,
[36:55.720 --> 36:59.680]  let that water nutrients, let that move up to the top of the plants. Uh,
[36:59.720 --> 37:02.240]  then pop them so that, uh,
[37:02.280 --> 37:05.160]  they get knurled and they get stronger and they look thicker and healthier.
[37:05.160 --> 37:07.840]  You can do that all the way up into like week two and three of flower.
[37:07.840 --> 37:10.200]  If you're comfortable doing it and you'll see a difference,
[37:10.200 --> 37:13.040]  maybe do it to some plants and don't do it to others and see what I'm telling
[37:13.040 --> 37:16.320]  you. See if it works. And then if it doesn't message me, call me out.
[37:16.320 --> 37:18.440]  And I'll read it on the show and I'll tell everybody how fucked up and was
[37:18.440 --> 37:20.200]  wrong, but I've got faith in the tech. So do it.
[37:21.360 --> 37:23.800]  Now I've been rambling for a long goddamn time. Holy crap.
[37:23.800 --> 37:25.720]  I never stopped and took a dab and take a drink.
[37:25.760 --> 37:29.200]  I think I've been going for 37 minutes. You guys are welcome. I love you guys.
[37:29.200 --> 37:32.240]  Thanks for listening to me ramble. I've got more though. Uh,
[37:32.240 --> 37:34.120]  when you're doing a screen of green technique,
[37:34.880 --> 37:36.720]  you are going to fill in a lot of space.
[37:36.720 --> 37:40.520]  You're going to have a bunch of screens in the way you're going to have to keep
[37:40.520 --> 37:43.680]  in mind how you're going to water the plants. Can you get to every pot?
[37:43.960 --> 37:48.200]  Can you get water to every pot easily? Are you going to have to crawl under there?
[37:48.200 --> 37:49.920]  Are you going to have the watering system built in?
[37:49.920 --> 37:53.080]  Keep that in mind before you get going. Can you move the tables?
[37:53.080 --> 37:54.040]  Can you move whatever?
[37:54.600 --> 37:57.760]  Just don't screw yourself and not be able to get in there to water.
[37:57.840 --> 38:00.880]  That's a huge thing. Now here's just a little extra.
[38:00.880 --> 38:04.640]  When you're doing the trellising, I would say use some zip ties,
[38:05.000 --> 38:09.280]  put up one corner, measure out how many squares wide.
[38:09.280 --> 38:14.440]  You feel like your tray is, and then try to leave. So this may sound crazy,
[38:14.440 --> 38:16.480]  but when you start doing it, you'll understand what I mean.
[38:16.480 --> 38:21.480]  Let's hypothetically say that the tray, that the net is like 30 squares wide.
[38:21.880 --> 38:24.720]  I think that might be accurate. So it's like 30 squares wide.
[38:24.720 --> 38:27.040]  I know that for the five foot table that I like to trellis,
[38:27.200 --> 38:31.760]  I have to count in two squares for that thing to fit perfectly on the PVC pipes.
[38:32.120 --> 38:36.800]  And I zip tie those two squares to the PVC on the, on my end.
[38:37.120 --> 38:40.120]  And then I just lay, I've dragged the net across the plants,
[38:40.360 --> 38:41.640]  across the table to the other end.
[38:41.640 --> 38:46.520]  And then I zip tie the appropriate squares at that end, leaving two squares.
[38:46.520 --> 38:49.520]  I count two squares in a zip tie that into the other end.
[38:49.960 --> 38:51.280]  And then I cut off the excess,
[38:51.280 --> 38:54.360]  but the two squares that are hanging off the right and left of each.
[38:54.360 --> 38:56.320]  And it looks like a tablecloth with a little excess.
[38:56.320 --> 38:59.400]  You guys, if that makes it easier to visualize, when you do this,
[38:59.400 --> 39:02.560]  it will make sense. If you do this, you'll go, Oh, that's what he fucking meant.
[39:03.040 --> 39:06.880]  The trellis will be wider than your table. So when you hang the trellis up,
[39:06.880 --> 39:08.320]  it'll be extra on the left and right.
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.520]  I use zip ties to create like a little cage.
[39:11.880 --> 39:16.080]  I bring those two down and zip tie them to the side of the bars also.
[39:16.320 --> 39:19.720]  So now I've got vertical trellis, keeping the plants up on the top.
[39:19.720 --> 39:23.680]  And then I've also got a little trellis on the sides, just two sections,
[39:23.680 --> 39:25.160]  maybe three sections of squares.
[39:25.400 --> 39:28.400]  So that if there are shorter branches that are falling on the edge of the table,
[39:28.640 --> 39:30.000]  those will be right there to catch them.
[39:30.040 --> 39:33.640]  So maybe some of the little guys that want to wander off in the commercial grow,
[39:33.640 --> 39:34.600]  if you don't have that there,
[39:34.600 --> 39:37.080]  some of those will end up just falling to the side and smacking you in the damn
[39:37.080 --> 39:38.640]  face every time you walk by.
[39:39.000 --> 39:41.240]  So I like to leave a little extra trellis on the sides,
[39:41.600 --> 39:45.120]  or if you're a spendy and you want to be bougie and go spend some extra money,
[39:45.440 --> 39:49.800]  go get more trellis and put trellis up just like a fence along the sides and
[39:49.800 --> 39:51.520]  just build a fence around the whole canopy.
[39:51.880 --> 39:55.000]  And that way you can get support all the way around that whole damn thing.
[39:55.040 --> 39:57.720]  But that's just, if you want to spend extra money, if you got,
[39:58.120 --> 40:00.400]  if you're one of those guys that just loves to be in the grow all day,
[40:00.400 --> 40:03.000]  and doesn't have shit else to do, go do that. It'll make it look really cool.
[40:03.040 --> 40:04.880]  It'll make it easy. All right.
[40:05.520 --> 40:10.040]  I hope I have taught you guys a little bit about screen of green. Um,
[40:10.320 --> 40:13.320]  sir, my friend G I'm just going to call you G your name starts with a G.
[40:13.320 --> 40:15.440]  I'm not sure if you want me to say your name. G uh,
[40:15.480 --> 40:18.120]  the guy that sent me this email. I hope I answered your question.
[40:18.160 --> 40:21.560]  I believe that is a very useful method is the short answer. Uh,
[40:21.600 --> 40:24.160]  I am proud of you for being, uh, through your first,
[40:24.280 --> 40:28.480]  halfway through your first flower and already trying to find ways to improve
[40:28.500 --> 40:30.840]  your next garden. That shows me that you're going to be a good grower.
[40:31.120 --> 40:32.600]  You're already thinking of ways to make it better.
[40:33.280 --> 40:34.800]  I want to thank you again for the email. Hey,
[40:34.800 --> 40:37.800]  if anybody out there has a question or wants to know how to improve their
[40:37.800 --> 40:41.080]  garden, send me an email. It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[40:41.280 --> 40:44.320]  I would love to hear from you. All right, you guys,
[40:44.320 --> 40:46.360]  I want to remind everybody about Patreon.
[40:46.360 --> 40:49.840]  I also want to thank everybody who has contributed to my Patreon campaign.
[40:49.880 --> 40:54.280]  I truly appreciate that. There's a new Mac book out.
[40:55.200 --> 40:57.480]  That's all I'm saying. I like this Mac book,
[40:57.480 --> 41:00.480]  but can't go wrong with the new Mac book. Right? Anyway,
[41:00.640 --> 41:03.840]  if you're interested in supporting the podcast and I'm mostly joking,
[41:03.840 --> 41:05.680]  you guys, this Mac book works fucking wonderfully.
[41:05.680 --> 41:07.480]  Although it did freeze one time in the middle of the show.
[41:07.480 --> 41:09.720]  I don't know if you noticed where that happened, but it did happen.
[41:10.160 --> 41:12.520]  There was a little bit of editing to be done. Uh, anyway,
[41:12.540 --> 41:16.240]  check out patreon.com slash grow from your heart for information on how to
[41:16.240 --> 41:19.640]  support the podcast. I would truly support your contribution,

[42:17.680 --> 42:19.840]  That's enough sales pitches and enough begging for today.

[42:30.480 --> 42:34.880]  I want to give another huge shout out to Mickey Martin and until next time,
[42:34.920 --> 42:37.600]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[43:37.970 --> 43:41.050]  You lost your faith in everyone you know.
[43:42.290 --> 43:45.650]  Well, I surely hope that you don't plan on winning.
[43:45.810 --> 43:48.010]  They'll start paying more attention.
[43:48.330 --> 43:52.610]  But once you turn your clear, you are seconds from the impact.
[44:04.270 --> 44:08.110]  You say time will surely mold you
[44:08.830 --> 44:12.510]  into something you don't like.
[44:13.310 --> 44:21.400]  Now you stick your finger in the dike.
[44:22.520 --> 44:31.440]  Your reflective skin is falling off your bones.
[44:32.440 --> 44:35.440]  Well, I must admit, I know just how you're feeling.
[44:36.440 --> 44:40.440]  Must climb each other's collar, must rise out of the water.
[44:40.440 --> 44:43.440]  You know as well as I do that it's no fun.
[44:54.550 --> 45:04.290]  I'm a 17 year old man. I promise you bitch, I'll never feel alone.
[45:05.290 --> 45:30.200]  This always scares you. Like the things under your bed.
[45:31.200 --> 45:37.690]  Maybe we're like some junkies.
[45:37.690 --> 45:39.690]  Why won't it end?
[45:39.690 --> 45:44.670]  The phone you set it is crucial.
[45:45.670 --> 45:49.670]  Stick your fingers in your ears till they explode.
[45:49.670 --> 45:53.670]  I guess business is rolling along as usual.
[45:53.670 --> 45:55.670]  Must climb each other's collar.
[47:17.170 --> 47:20.170]  You know as well as I do that it's no fun.
[47:21.170 --> 47:26.170]  I'm a 17 year old man. I promise you bitch, I'll never feel alone.
[47:27.170 --> 47:31.170]  This always scares you. Like the things under your bed.
[47:32.170 --> 47:34.170]  Maybe we're like some junkies.
[47:35.170 --> 47:37.170]  Why won't it end?
[47:38.170 --> 47:41.170]  The phone you set it is crucial.
[47:42.170 --> 47:45.170]  I guess business is rolling along as usual.
