[01:33.080 --> 01:36.040]  make it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:36.040 --> 01:40.400]  All right, I don't have anything to ramble about here at the start of the show.
[01:40.400 --> 01:44.620]  Let's jump right into a discussion about foliar feeding our plants.
[01:44.620 --> 01:45.940]  What is foliar feeding?
[01:45.940 --> 01:48.020]  That's a good place to start.
[01:48.020 --> 01:53.620]  Foliar feeding is spraying our plants with a nutrient solution to provide nutrients to
[01:53.620 --> 01:54.620]  the plants.
[01:54.620 --> 01:55.620]  That's right.
[01:55.620 --> 01:57.180]  Sometimes we can't water the plants.
[01:57.180 --> 02:00.040]  Sometimes it's not necessary to water the plant.
[02:00.040 --> 02:01.900]  Sometimes there are no roots to water.
[02:01.900 --> 02:06.500]  So we foliar feed that plant to give it nutrients, to give it life, to give it sustenance, to
[02:06.500 --> 02:11.360]  keep it green, vigorous, lush, and healthy throughout its life.
[02:11.360 --> 02:14.800]  Here are some things we would foliar feed our plants.
[02:14.800 --> 02:19.400]  Some very commonly fed things are nitrogen and calcium.
[02:19.400 --> 02:21.960]  I tried to combine that into one word.
[02:21.960 --> 02:23.520]  That has not been invented yet.
[02:23.520 --> 02:25.960]  It is still nitrogen and calcium.
[02:25.960 --> 02:29.460]  Also many micronutrients are good for foliar feeding.
[02:29.460 --> 02:30.840]  We can foliar feed a lot of things.
[02:30.840 --> 02:34.800]  The most important part about foliar feeding, I shouldn't say the most, one of the most
[02:34.800 --> 02:38.360]  important, a big important part is to have a strategy, have a goal.
[02:38.360 --> 02:40.240]  Why are you foliar feeding?
[02:40.240 --> 02:41.720]  What is the plant deficient in?
[02:41.720 --> 02:44.000]  What are you trying to boost up a little bit?
[02:44.000 --> 02:49.160]  Have a timing, a strategy, a rhyme, and a reason for it, or it can go terribly wrong.
[02:49.160 --> 02:50.360]  But it can be a great booster.
[02:50.360 --> 02:51.800]  It can be a great corrector.
[02:51.800 --> 02:55.680]  It can be a very useful tool in our arsenal as a grower.
[02:55.680 --> 02:57.720]  So let's talk about foliar feeding.
[02:57.720 --> 03:00.240]  I just mentioned why would we foliar feed some plants?
[03:00.240 --> 03:05.400]  I've got a very good example of why I foliar fed some plants just recently.
[03:05.400 --> 03:08.880]  I recently bought a new batch of soil.
[03:08.880 --> 03:09.880]  Supplies are limited.
[03:10.040 --> 03:11.560]  We're in this weird pandemic still.
[03:11.560 --> 03:14.920]  Things are not arriving at the stores like we would hope and expect them to.
[03:14.920 --> 03:19.240]  For a small grow project, I bought a new batch of soil I've never used.
[03:19.240 --> 03:21.240]  And honestly, it does not drain well.
[03:21.240 --> 03:22.240]  It needs more aeration.
[03:22.240 --> 03:23.800]  It needs more fluff to it.
[03:23.800 --> 03:26.560]  I should have mixed that in before I got the plants in there.
[03:26.560 --> 03:27.800]  However, I did not realize it.
[03:27.800 --> 03:29.160]  I thought it would work.
[03:29.160 --> 03:33.280]  When I watered those plants, that soilless mix really crushed down on those plants.
[03:33.280 --> 03:34.560]  The roots are kind of suffocated.
[03:34.560 --> 03:35.960]  They're not happy with me.
[03:35.960 --> 03:37.960]  They're not growing as well as they could be.
[03:37.960 --> 03:41.640]  And most importantly, they're not drying at the rate that I would hope that size of
[03:41.640 --> 03:44.720]  a pot with that much water would dry.
[03:44.720 --> 03:46.800]  Now those plants still need nutrients.
[03:46.800 --> 03:51.240]  I want to feed them, but I can't give them nutrients in the root zone because that is
[03:51.240 --> 03:53.000]  already soaked, already saturated.
[03:53.000 --> 03:54.480]  I want that to dry out.
[03:54.480 --> 03:58.360]  That's going to get probably two or three watering cycles before it actually does get
[03:58.360 --> 03:59.600]  watered again.
[03:59.600 --> 04:03.440]  So at this time, to provide nutrients for those freshly transplanted plants that are
[04:03.440 --> 04:07.080]  stubborn, that are kind of not wanting to grow, they're getting foliar fed.
[04:07.080 --> 04:08.760]  They're getting their nitrogen, their calcium.
[04:08.760 --> 04:12.680]  A couple other base nutrients are happening through a foliar feeding.
[04:12.680 --> 04:17.000]  So that's one reason why I am feeding the plants with the foliar feed.
[04:17.000 --> 04:21.400]  I'm going to let them dry, keep hitting them with that foliar feed until they are ready
[04:21.400 --> 04:22.760]  for a nutrient feed.
[04:22.760 --> 04:23.760]  I won't overdo it.
[04:23.760 --> 04:25.000]  I will pay close attention.
[04:25.000 --> 04:28.960]  We'll talk about dosing them, the nutrient amount here in just a moment.
[04:28.960 --> 04:33.240]  I'm paying attention to my notes to make sure I didn't get off track because I already got
[04:33.240 --> 04:34.240]  off track.
[04:34.240 --> 04:35.240]  There we go.
[04:35.240 --> 04:36.620]  So foliar feed clones.
[04:36.660 --> 04:38.660]  We often foliar feed our clones.
[04:38.660 --> 04:40.500]  When I cut clones, they don't have roots.
[04:40.500 --> 04:43.020]  When you cut clones, they start off with no roots.
[04:43.020 --> 04:44.020]  How do we feed them?
[04:44.020 --> 04:48.020]  We feed them through that humidity dome, through the humidity in the room.
[04:48.020 --> 04:51.740]  Also I'll take off that dome and hit them straight with a sprayer and foliar feed them
[04:51.740 --> 04:56.140]  with a light nutrient solution that is technically foliar feeding those plants.
[04:56.140 --> 04:59.540]  So the clones always take a good foliar.
[04:59.540 --> 05:04.420]  Another reason to foliar feed our plants is to provide a specific nutrient to a specific
[05:04.420 --> 05:06.340]  plant in a room.
[05:07.060 --> 05:09.740]  Maybe you've got a hydroponic setup or an ebb and flow setup to where all of the plants
[05:09.740 --> 05:11.700]  are getting fed the same thing.
[05:11.700 --> 05:13.420]  Maybe one plant in there is stubborn.
[05:13.420 --> 05:14.820]  Maybe it wants a little bit more.
[05:14.820 --> 05:15.980]  Maybe it's hungry.
[05:15.980 --> 05:17.380]  Maybe it needs extra nitrogen.
[05:17.380 --> 05:18.820]  Maybe it needs extra phosphorus.
[05:18.820 --> 05:20.540]  Maybe it needs extra cow mag.
[05:20.540 --> 05:24.900]  What we can do is we can mix up those nutrients in a foliar solution and apply it to that
[05:24.900 --> 05:30.420]  one plant directly through a foliar application instead of trying to boost up all of the feed
[05:30.420 --> 05:34.180]  in the entire hydroponic system or aquaponic system or whatever.
[05:34.180 --> 05:38.220]  We can feed that one stubborn plant, that Congo plant in the corner that wants more
[05:38.220 --> 05:41.340]  food than everybody, that golden goat plant that eats extra.
[05:41.340 --> 05:45.620]  We can feed it without overfeeding the rest of our plants.
[05:45.620 --> 05:49.140]  Now let's talk about the actual act of foliar feeding our plants.
[05:49.140 --> 05:51.100]  We know a little bit about what to feed.
[05:51.100 --> 05:54.980]  I told you definitely have a reason why you are foliar feeding.
[05:54.980 --> 05:57.140]  You can use the foliar feed to correct.
[05:57.140 --> 05:58.140]  You can use it to boost.
[05:58.140 --> 06:01.500]  You can use it as a regular feed, but have a strategy and a reason.
[06:01.660 --> 06:02.820]  When you do it, write it down.
[06:02.820 --> 06:04.740]  I will mention that again later.
[06:04.740 --> 06:06.440]  Let's talk about actually foliar feeding.
[06:06.440 --> 06:07.560]  We know why.
[06:07.560 --> 06:09.520]  We know what to feed it.
[06:09.520 --> 06:12.600]  Let's talk about doing the actual task.
[06:12.600 --> 06:15.140]  Usually you're going to, I would recommend spraying.
[06:15.140 --> 06:18.900]  Most of our sprays are going to happen in veg or early flower.
[06:18.900 --> 06:24.380]  I recommend not spraying chunky buds unless you've got a very good reason.
[06:24.380 --> 06:26.220]  Chunky buds do not need to get sprayed.
[06:26.220 --> 06:30.300]  If you've got bugs, if you've got problems, if you're trying to boost it up, find a better
[06:30.300 --> 06:33.380]  solution if you were getting big, chunky nuggets.
[06:33.380 --> 06:39.420]  Anytime past like week three, day 21 is usually the last time I will spray unless it's highly
[06:39.420 --> 06:40.580]  necessary.
[06:40.580 --> 06:44.060]  I will hit the plants at day 21 of flower.
[06:44.060 --> 06:45.820]  They're starting to set those good bud sets.
[06:45.820 --> 06:50.180]  Give them one good final foliar feed, one good final pesticide rinse, and hope that
[06:50.180 --> 06:53.740]  that lasts you for the next six or seven weeks to get you to harvest.
[06:53.740 --> 06:55.300]  So don't spray chunky buds.
[06:55.300 --> 07:00.660]  If you've got to spray buds that are developing, remember those buds do have trichomes on the
[07:00.660 --> 07:04.380]  outside that act like a water repellent as a UV protectant.
[07:04.380 --> 07:07.000]  I think the UV, anyway, let's get back on track.
[07:07.000 --> 07:09.820]  The trichomes will protect from a little bit of water.
[07:09.820 --> 07:14.940]  The plants are going to be okay with a mist, but we don't want to saturate the buds.
[07:14.940 --> 07:16.020]  They're spongy.
[07:16.020 --> 07:17.500]  Think about all the, they're spongy.
[07:17.500 --> 07:19.820]  If you squeeze them and let them go, there's a lot of moisture in there.
[07:19.820 --> 07:21.680]  They can hold a lot of water.
[07:21.680 --> 07:23.620]  Don't create a problem for your chunky buds.
[07:23.620 --> 07:25.140]  Do not spray them.
[07:25.140 --> 07:30.820]  The next thing I've got on my notes is avoid horticultural and botanical oils, especially
[07:30.820 --> 07:34.980]  if you are going to make concentrates out of your products.
[07:34.980 --> 07:37.980]  All of those oils will end up in your concentrate.
[07:37.980 --> 07:42.540]  If they don't evaporate, dissipate, or get washed off in some other manner, they're going
[07:42.540 --> 07:45.820]  to end up in your flowers, in your concentrates.
[07:45.820 --> 07:50.120]  Have you ever gone to the dispensary or even bought herb from a friend or a regular person
[07:50.120 --> 07:53.660]  that you know somewhere, and they just sold you some herb and you smoke it, and it's got
[07:53.660 --> 07:58.420]  like a minty flavor or sort of an aftershave sort of flavor or something?
[07:58.420 --> 08:02.300]  That is probably from some of the funky oils that they applied to the plant to prevent
[08:02.300 --> 08:05.620]  powdery mildew or other molds or pest problems.
[08:05.620 --> 08:08.580]  So don't spray your plants with oils.
[08:08.580 --> 08:11.260]  I especially do not like neem oil.
[08:11.260 --> 08:15.040]  I don't like peppermint, rosemary, none of that hippie oil.
[08:15.040 --> 08:18.820]  If you're going to use that for your hippie magic, do that, but not on the plants, please.
[08:18.820 --> 08:21.000]  It's going to make the plants taste like shit.
[08:22.000 --> 08:26.600]  I've been in the room or been involved in concentrate making of all different types.
[08:26.600 --> 08:30.880]  When you're making BHO concentrates, you can see some of the pesticides and oils float
[08:30.880 --> 08:32.680]  to the top.
[08:32.680 --> 08:37.160]  There's your concentrate, your crystals at the bottom, the liquid in the middle, the
[08:37.160 --> 08:41.840]  terps at the top, and then that funky layer of frothy shit, that's the shit you should
[08:41.840 --> 08:42.920]  not have sprayed on there.
[08:42.920 --> 08:47.680]  That's your pesticides, your contaminants, possibly a surfactant.
[08:47.680 --> 08:49.200]  That's a lot of shit that could have been in there.
[08:49.200 --> 08:51.960]  So if you're making concentrates, don't spray it.
[08:51.960 --> 08:55.000]  And also don't spray your flowers with funky shit.
[08:55.000 --> 08:57.920]  Now let's talk about foliar feeding a little bit more in depth.
[08:57.920 --> 08:58.920]  Go light.
[08:58.920 --> 09:02.720]  When you are foliar feeding, you're applying this directly to the leaves.
[09:02.720 --> 09:03.720]  We don't need that.
[09:03.720 --> 09:08.680]  If it says apply 100, only apply about 15 to 25.
[09:08.680 --> 09:13.560]  Remember, you can spray more, but you can't unspray those nutrients.
[09:13.560 --> 09:18.120]  If you see some burn, some leaf curl, some leaf damage, that is because you sprayed too
[09:18.120 --> 09:22.800]  hard or my next note, you possibly sprayed with the lights on.
[09:22.800 --> 09:26.240]  Turn the lights off, foliar feed or spray.
[09:26.240 --> 09:29.600]  Wait for the foliar feed to completely turn the fans off as well.
[09:29.600 --> 09:31.360]  Turn the lights and the fans off.
[09:31.360 --> 09:32.840]  Apply your foliar feed.
[09:32.840 --> 09:35.520]  Wait for that to dry, then turn the lights back on.
[09:35.520 --> 09:39.960]  If you spray with the lights on, remember when you were a kid, a lot of boys did this.
[09:39.960 --> 09:42.640]  You girls won't know what I'm talking about probably.
[09:42.640 --> 09:45.880]  When we were a kid, we would get a magnifying glass and you could burn ants or you could
[09:45.880 --> 09:51.960]  catch paper on fire with the magnifying glass by using the sun and that bubble angle of
[09:51.960 --> 09:55.600]  the light and you could focus that light on a piece of paper or possibly the ants if you
[09:55.600 --> 09:58.240]  were creepy and you could catch some shit on fire.
[09:58.240 --> 10:02.920]  I think that that bubble that is on your leaf surface acts with the grow light and it will
[10:02.920 --> 10:05.760]  make the same type of burn on your plants.
[10:05.760 --> 10:09.920]  We will get, or also we can potentially get some phytotoxicity from the light and the
[10:09.920 --> 10:15.400]  heat interacting with some foliar feeds, especially oily pesticides.
[10:15.400 --> 10:20.080]  So my advice, spray a light solution of foliar feed.
[10:20.080 --> 10:26.080]  If you're using nutrients, go lightly and also spray always in the dark with the lights off.
[10:26.080 --> 10:27.080]  Don't have the grow lights on.
[10:27.080 --> 10:30.800]  The light above me, like the little LED light lighting up the room, that is cool, but your
[10:30.800 --> 10:32.120]  grow lights, turn those off.
[10:32.120 --> 10:34.880]  Any high intensity lighting for your grow, turn that off.
[10:34.880 --> 10:38.480]  Your normal room lights you could see and work, that'll be just fine, but we don't want
[10:38.480 --> 10:41.300]  the big grow lights, the big bright shit, turn that off.
[10:41.300 --> 10:44.200]  We don't want to get problems on the plants.
[10:44.400 --> 10:44.900]  All right.
[10:44.900 --> 10:49.440]  Also, I said a moment ago that using a surfactant will pop up in our concentrates.
[10:49.440 --> 10:53.320]  Oftentimes, if you're going to spray something, it is a good idea to use a surfactant.
[10:53.320 --> 10:54.880]  That is something to think about.
[10:54.880 --> 10:59.600]  That is a sticker and a spreader, something you would mix in with your foliar feed.
[10:59.600 --> 11:03.120]  I use this with a pesticide with the foliar feed quite often in veg.
[11:03.120 --> 11:08.040]  I wouldn't do this past the late veg stage because this may pop up in your concentrates,
[11:08.040 --> 11:13.200]  but something to spread and stick this application to the leaves.
[11:13.200 --> 11:17.280]  They sell products, dish soap is acceptable, cocoa wet is acceptable.
[11:17.280 --> 11:21.400]  There are a lot of great things that will work as a surfactant if you'd feel like you
[11:21.400 --> 11:22.400]  need it.
[11:22.400 --> 11:25.920]  I use it to make the product stick and go further because oftentimes I'm working in
[11:25.920 --> 11:28.240]  a commercial grow and every little bit helps.
[11:28.240 --> 11:29.240]  I think it'll really help.
[11:29.240 --> 11:33.480]  If you're in a small grow, it may not do a big difference, but I think it helps.
[11:33.480 --> 11:34.480]  All right.
[11:34.480 --> 11:36.040]  Also, don't spray that too late.
[11:36.040 --> 11:38.720]  Don't go after week three or week two of flower.
[11:38.720 --> 11:41.480]  Don't use your surfactants, any sort of oils, anything like that.
[11:41.480 --> 11:43.160]  It's best not to spray at all.
[11:43.160 --> 11:44.920]  I understand shit happens.
[11:44.920 --> 11:46.040]  You may have to do some stuff.
[11:46.040 --> 11:47.040]  I get it.
[11:47.040 --> 11:48.880]  Adapt, adjust, save the crop.
[11:48.880 --> 11:49.880]  All right.
[11:49.880 --> 11:54.480]  When we are foliar feeding, I would recommend a pH of around seven.
[11:54.480 --> 11:59.280]  Adjust the pH of your foliar feed to about seven, six, eight, seven, two, somewhere around
[11:59.280 --> 12:00.600]  there is going to be good.
[12:00.600 --> 12:06.800]  Seven will work the best to not burn the leaves and achieve best nutrient absorption depending
[12:06.800 --> 12:09.440]  on the nutrients you are applying to these plants.
[12:09.440 --> 12:10.760]  That's also going to matter a lot.
[12:11.040 --> 12:12.040]  All right.
[12:12.040 --> 12:13.080]  Let's keep moving forward.
[12:13.080 --> 12:16.080]  Spray the plant starting at the bottom and work your way up.
[12:16.080 --> 12:19.720]  This is standard horticultural spraying practice.
[12:19.720 --> 12:22.560]  My tongue is not liking the word horticultural today.
[12:22.560 --> 12:27.320]  I don't know why, but when we are applying pesticides or a foliar feed to the plants,
[12:27.320 --> 12:31.600]  start at the bottom, the bottom inside of the plant, work your way out and up.
[12:31.600 --> 12:35.640]  So kind of worked in the middle, spray out toward the outer edge, then work your way
[12:35.640 --> 12:39.640]  up the plant, lifting the leaves as you go a little bit, getting the bottom of the leaves.
[12:39.680 --> 12:42.320]  That also gets the top of the leaves that you just sprayed.
[12:42.320 --> 12:44.040]  You'll get the whole thing.
[12:44.040 --> 12:48.840]  Something to think about, I like to spray a foliar feed on the top of the leaf and a
[12:48.840 --> 12:52.760]  pesticide on the bottom of the leaf is kind of how I focus.
[12:52.760 --> 12:56.440]  If I'm hitting it hard, I will coat that entire fucking plant just to make sure there are
[12:56.440 --> 12:57.440]  no bugs in there.
[12:57.440 --> 12:59.200]  It just depends on what the goal is.
[12:59.200 --> 13:03.800]  But rule of thumb, kind of in general, pesticides on the bottom, foliar feed on the top of the
[13:03.800 --> 13:04.800]  leaf.
[13:04.800 --> 13:08.320]  If you're trying to be economical, cost effective, that's the best way to do it.
[13:08.320 --> 13:09.320]  So spray at the bottom.
[13:10.000 --> 13:11.000]  Work your way up.
[13:11.000 --> 13:15.920]  Don't overspray with a foliar feed, but coat and soak the leaves or don't overspray.
[13:15.920 --> 13:16.920]  That's what I said.
[13:16.920 --> 13:18.880]  We don't want it running off and draining off.
[13:18.880 --> 13:22.720]  You don't want the outer edge of the plants on the ground to look like it was raining.
[13:22.720 --> 13:25.240]  You want to maybe look like it got misted there a little bit.
[13:25.240 --> 13:26.400]  Don't waste your pesticides.
[13:26.400 --> 13:27.740]  Don't overspray.
[13:27.740 --> 13:31.580]  If you overspray, you risk the potential of all that spray running right off of your plants.
[13:31.580 --> 13:33.220]  You want it to be on there.
[13:33.220 --> 13:35.000]  The smaller the bubbles, the better.
[13:35.000 --> 13:39.480]  If you can get super small bubbles to spray on your plants, the better.
[13:39.480 --> 13:41.520]  The plants will absorb more that way.
[13:41.520 --> 13:45.640]  They'll get more of the, if it's a foliar feed or a pesticide application, they will
[13:45.640 --> 13:48.440]  get the best with the smaller bubbles.
[13:48.440 --> 13:51.320]  I'm making sure I'm following my notes here.
[13:51.320 --> 13:53.920]  Spray the top, bottom for bugs.
[13:53.920 --> 13:55.960]  Always write down what you've sprayed.
[13:55.960 --> 14:00.080]  Write down what you sprayed, exactly how much of it you sprayed, when you sprayed it, the
[14:00.080 --> 14:02.240]  date, every plant that got sprayed.
[14:02.240 --> 14:04.440]  In a commercial environment, I talk about this a lot.
[14:04.880 --> 14:05.880]  You've already heard this.
[14:05.880 --> 14:10.640]  In a commercial environment, we have to write down what we sprayed, our license number,
[14:10.640 --> 14:15.080]  the EPA number of the product we sprayed, what time we applied it, how much of it we
[14:15.080 --> 14:19.680]  used per gallon of water, how many gallons of water were applied to the room, which plants
[14:19.680 --> 14:20.680]  were sprayed.
[14:20.680 --> 14:25.080]  We're supposed to write down either all plants in room A, which is how we used to do it,
[14:25.080 --> 14:26.880]  or the plant tag numbers.
[14:26.880 --> 14:32.160]  You've got to write down a lot of information, the time, the date, the re-entry time.
[14:32.160 --> 14:33.880]  All of that stuff is going to be written down.
[14:33.880 --> 14:36.080]  I recommend you write that down now.
[14:36.080 --> 14:39.320]  Just get yourself in the habit of writing that stuff down.
[14:39.320 --> 14:43.440]  Now while you're writing down what you foliar sprayed, maybe consider writing down what
[14:43.440 --> 14:44.840]  you were trying to correct.
[14:44.840 --> 14:48.640]  What was your reason for spraying this particular mix?
[14:48.640 --> 14:53.240]  Why did you mix up this much of your base nutrients and a dash of cow mag and spray
[14:53.240 --> 14:54.400]  that on your plants today?
[14:54.400 --> 14:55.400]  What was your goal?
[14:55.400 --> 14:58.160]  Did you see something wrong or were you trying to boost them?
[14:58.160 --> 15:00.520]  Were you just trying to give them a little push?
[15:00.520 --> 15:05.360]  We'll talk about push in a moment because that's one of my favorite foliar feeding products.
[15:05.360 --> 15:07.360]  Also I feed, what's the other one?
[15:07.360 --> 15:10.640]  Liquid Karma and Push are my two favorites to foliar feed.
[15:10.640 --> 15:14.400]  Also you'll see me foliar feed a lot of cow mag, but let's keep going.
[15:14.400 --> 15:16.700]  I recommend a pump sprayer.
[15:16.700 --> 15:19.160]  They sell pump sprayers in a lot of different sizes.
[15:19.160 --> 15:23.160]  You don't want to be in there with a little spray bottle like you're doing the windows.
[15:23.160 --> 15:24.160]  That will kill your wrist.
[15:24.160 --> 15:27.880]  If you've got more than one plant, your wrist is going to die.
[15:27.880 --> 15:32.520]  Invest in the appropriate size pump sprayer to get the best application you can.
[15:32.520 --> 15:37.120]  Those little deck sprayers or pesticide sprayers that they sell at your local hardware shop.
[15:37.120 --> 15:40.240]  If you've got a small mom and pop shop, I recommend you go there.
[15:40.240 --> 15:43.920]  If not, they've got them at the orange box shop or the blue box shop at Home Depot and
[15:43.920 --> 15:45.360]  Lowe's has got you covered.
[15:45.360 --> 15:46.360]  Get one of those pump sprayers.
[15:46.360 --> 15:48.940]  It's like a gallon, maybe two gallons of water.
[15:48.940 --> 15:49.940]  You don't have to fill it.
[15:49.940 --> 15:54.960]  You can put one gallon in there, put enough nutrients to foliar feed one gallon, do your
[15:54.960 --> 15:57.600]  feeding application and then clean it out.
[15:57.600 --> 16:01.560]  Don't leave that pump sprayer sitting there with old pesticides, old nutrients in there.
[16:01.560 --> 16:02.560]  It's going to get moldy.
[16:02.560 --> 16:03.560]  It will get funky.
[16:03.560 --> 16:06.360]  Then you're going to apply mold to your plants the next time you use it.
[16:06.360 --> 16:07.360]  Take care of your shit.
[16:07.360 --> 16:10.100]  Buy it one time, clean it every time you use it.
[16:10.100 --> 16:11.400]  It should last quite a while.
[16:11.400 --> 16:13.200]  The rings on there stay well.
[16:13.200 --> 16:16.800]  A little note when you are buying those pump sprayers.
[16:16.800 --> 16:19.280]  This is fucking random, but it will help you out.
[16:19.280 --> 16:25.200]  I prefer the pump sprayer that has a pressure release valve.
[16:25.200 --> 16:26.400]  Let's talk about what's going to happen.
[16:26.400 --> 16:27.920]  We're going to get a pump sprayer.
[16:27.920 --> 16:31.760]  You're going to put the amount of water which you'd like to put in there, one or two gallons,
[16:31.760 --> 16:33.440]  maybe less, maybe more.
[16:33.440 --> 16:36.600]  We're going to add our nutrients, our pesticide.
[16:36.600 --> 16:38.240]  Then we're going to put our surfactant.
[16:38.240 --> 16:39.320]  Then we're going to pH it.
[16:39.320 --> 16:40.960]  Then we're going to shake the shit out of it.
[16:40.960 --> 16:45.000]  That's one thing to always think about when using any sort of spray application.
[16:45.000 --> 16:46.000]  Shake it.
[16:46.000 --> 16:50.320]  Make sure you've got that emulsified in that container so you're not just applying ... Imagine
[16:50.320 --> 16:53.200]  if the Kool-Aid was real thick at the bottom and you just drank the top half.
[16:53.200 --> 16:56.240]  You'd be mad when everybody got to the bottom without you.
[16:56.240 --> 16:57.240]  Mix it up real good.
[16:57.240 --> 16:58.240]  Shake the shit out of it.
[16:58.240 --> 17:03.680]  Then we're going to pump it real good, 25 pumps or something like that on the big ones,
[17:03.680 --> 17:06.680]  12 or something pumps on the little ones is what it recommends on the label.
[17:06.680 --> 17:10.600]  We're going to pump it to where it's going to have good pressure to spray real hard.
[17:10.600 --> 17:13.280]  At this point, I recommend you've already got gloves and goggles on.
[17:13.280 --> 17:15.120]  We should have mentioned that before.
[17:15.120 --> 17:19.960]  Always wear your personal protective equipment when mixing, shaking, applying, messing with
[17:19.960 --> 17:21.760]  the pesticides or the foliar feeds.
[17:21.760 --> 17:23.160]  You can get it in your eye.
[17:23.160 --> 17:24.200]  It's going to suck.
[17:24.200 --> 17:26.080]  Wear your personal protective equipment.
[17:26.920 --> 17:27.920]  That's a note from Ross to Jeff.
[17:27.920 --> 17:29.080]  We're going to shake it up, right?
[17:29.080 --> 17:30.080]  Shake the shit out of it.
[17:30.080 --> 17:31.360]  Shake, shake, shake it up, baby.
[17:31.360 --> 17:33.480]  Now, then we're going to spray the plants.
[17:33.480 --> 17:37.520]  Now, it's time to clean our sprayer.
[17:37.520 --> 17:39.840]  We didn't use all the charge from the pump.
[17:39.840 --> 17:43.880]  I want to let off that pressure, but I don't want to stand there and spray my pesticide
[17:43.880 --> 17:47.080]  or my foliar feed into the air because the plants are sprayed.
[17:47.080 --> 17:49.560]  I don't want to spray it into the toilet, down the drain.
[17:49.560 --> 17:51.400]  What am I going to do to let that pressure off?
[17:51.400 --> 17:55.800]  I like a spray bottle or a sprayer that's got the pressure release valve so that when
[17:55.840 --> 17:59.720]  I unscrew that top valve, it doesn't blast off into my face.
[17:59.720 --> 18:04.440]  You can simply let some of the pressure off, unscrew it, and not break your pump sprayer.
[18:04.440 --> 18:06.320]  I think it'll make it last longer.
[18:06.320 --> 18:10.400]  They're not much more expensive, so I think it will be worth the small investment.
[18:10.400 --> 18:11.400]  You can find those.
[18:11.400 --> 18:14.160]  I recommend always go to a local mom and pop shop.
[18:14.160 --> 18:17.640]  That's the way we should do it, support mom and pop, support local shops.
[18:17.640 --> 18:20.760]  If you don't support them, when you do need them, they won't be there.
[18:20.760 --> 18:24.560]  They'll tell you, order from Amazon, bro, and then Amazon doesn't have any advice or
[18:24.560 --> 18:25.560]  guidance.
[18:26.320 --> 18:28.880]  Go to a mom and pop shop, help them out, their guidance and advice, their interaction will
[18:28.880 --> 18:30.320]  be worth the extra couple of bucks.
[18:30.320 --> 18:33.600]  Again, if they're not available, hit that Lowe's, the Home Depot.
[18:33.600 --> 18:34.960]  They've always got sprayers.
[18:34.960 --> 18:40.160]  Over in the pesticide area, they've got that big gross pesticide section there.
[18:40.160 --> 18:41.760]  You can find some useful things.
[18:41.760 --> 18:44.200]  Pick up a package of mosquito dunks while you're there.
[18:44.200 --> 18:48.440]  I just did the Dave Letterman, fucking Johnny Carson phone pinpoint.
[18:48.440 --> 18:49.440]  I call this a phone.
[18:49.440 --> 18:51.640]  Also, that fucking, that's a brain injury.
[18:51.640 --> 18:52.840]  But there we go.
[18:52.840 --> 18:54.560]  Get some skeeter dunks while you're there.
[18:54.560 --> 18:55.560]  That's a presidential point.
[18:55.560 --> 18:58.880]  If I ever seen one, the Obama point.
[18:58.880 --> 19:00.600]  Mosquito dunks come in handy for a lot of things.
[19:00.600 --> 19:04.800]  We can mix those up in our regular feed and put those in the water and get rid of a lot
[19:04.800 --> 19:08.160]  of basic soil-borne pests.
[19:08.160 --> 19:09.160]  Let me get back on track.
[19:09.160 --> 19:11.560]  Get yourself a good sprayer while you're at the store there.
[19:11.560 --> 19:12.560]  Get some skeeter dunks.
[19:12.560 --> 19:13.740]  They're good for you.
[19:13.740 --> 19:15.560]  Get something that makes small bubbles.
[19:15.560 --> 19:20.200]  I don't necessarily use a fogger, but get something that makes the best small bubbles
[19:20.200 --> 19:21.200]  you can find.
[19:21.200 --> 19:27.800]  Again, use a mask and goggles and gloves when you're doing any sort of spray application.
[19:27.800 --> 19:31.720]  Remember, if you put any pesticides in here, let's talk about this.
[19:31.720 --> 19:36.160]  You can foliar feed and apply a pesticide application at the same time.
[19:36.160 --> 19:38.680]  I've mentioned this a couple of times before.
[19:38.680 --> 19:41.640]  My favorite foliar feeding product is Push.
[19:41.640 --> 19:46.360]  That is from the VegBloom company, which is actually hydroponicresearch.com.
[19:46.360 --> 19:48.800]  It's hydroponic-research.com.
[19:48.800 --> 19:53.440]  To the best of my recollection, that is where I remember finding that and buying that, things
[19:53.440 --> 19:54.440]  change on the internet.
[19:54.440 --> 19:58.560]  That may be totally different by now, but Push from the people that make VegBloom is
[19:58.560 --> 19:59.560]  a great product.
[19:59.560 --> 20:03.800]  I will add Push in with other products and pesticides.
[20:03.800 --> 20:10.320]  It would not be uncommon for me to add Push, cow mag, and a little bit of evergreen, and
[20:10.320 --> 20:12.200]  possibly one more pesticide.
[20:12.200 --> 20:13.200]  Let's just pick one.
[20:13.200 --> 20:16.080]  I don't want to even imagine I don't have my notes in front of me.
[20:16.080 --> 20:18.880]  You'd pick another pesticide and mix it right on in there.
[20:18.880 --> 20:20.760]  You're getting your cow mag fixed.
[20:20.760 --> 20:24.680]  You're getting a good push of a boost, and you're getting two pesticide applications
[20:24.680 --> 20:29.240]  at once, attacking from multiple angles to get rid of those pests.
[20:29.240 --> 20:31.680]  That is okay to do in my experience.
[20:31.680 --> 20:35.960]  Maybe mix small batches before you go hard and spray everything and test it out, but
[20:35.960 --> 20:40.880]  in most of my experience, I can mix pesticides and foliar feeds at the same time.
[20:40.880 --> 20:44.120]  When you're doing that, personal protective equipment, I keep saying that.
[20:44.160 --> 20:47.120]  I put some of my notes here in capital bold letters, PPE.
[20:47.120 --> 20:50.160]  I don't want to be the one responsible for getting you sick or injured.
[20:50.160 --> 20:53.080]  I want to make sure you set yourself up for success.
[20:53.080 --> 20:57.680]  Part of success is setting yourself up for the long run by taking good care of yourself
[20:57.680 --> 21:01.640]  with personal protective equipment.
[21:01.640 --> 21:04.840]  There will be a humidity spike after any sort of spray.
[21:04.840 --> 21:06.200]  Be prepared for that.
[21:06.200 --> 21:07.740]  Keep an eye on that on your equipment.
[21:07.740 --> 21:12.400]  Maybe learn to adjust the fans and the blowers to take care of that humidity spike.
[21:12.840 --> 21:17.440]  You may have to dump the humidifier early because there will be more water in the air.
[21:17.440 --> 21:18.480]  I've said this before.
[21:18.480 --> 21:23.200]  If there are no buds, your pesticide and foliar applications will be just fine.
[21:23.200 --> 21:27.200]  If you do have buds, spray lightly.
[21:27.200 --> 21:28.840]  Only spray if you've got a reason.
[21:28.840 --> 21:33.000]  Don't just spray because it's fun, because you heard of a foliar application idea that
[21:33.000 --> 21:34.320]  looked cool.
[21:34.320 --> 21:39.640]  Spray with purpose and intent or it will cause problems, but it can correct a lot of things.
[21:39.640 --> 21:43.520]  If you're applying nutrients directly to the leaf where you see an issue, you'll be
[21:43.520 --> 21:47.440]  amazed at how quickly, if you've got a light issue.
[21:47.440 --> 21:51.240]  If those spider mites have been sucking the life out of your plants, put a touch of base
[21:51.240 --> 21:55.040]  nutrients in with your pesticide, your spider mite spray.
[21:55.040 --> 21:59.440]  I'm going to say evergreen and a little bit of cow mag and a little bit of base nutrients
[21:59.440 --> 22:00.440]  together.
[22:00.440 --> 22:05.440]  After a spider mite infestation, you'll be wiping out the bugs and replenishing the nutrients
[22:05.440 --> 22:06.440]  at the same time.
[22:06.440 --> 22:09.480]  You'll go in and the leaves won't be green or yellow and funky.
[22:09.480 --> 22:10.840]  They'll be green and healthy again.
[22:10.840 --> 22:11.840]  It'll be amazing.
[22:11.840 --> 22:16.080]  All right, I'm going over the notes, making sure I covered all of the notes on the iPad.
[22:16.080 --> 22:19.520]  Then we're going to stare at the computer paper here for a moment, make sure we got
[22:19.520 --> 22:21.080]  all of those.
[22:21.080 --> 22:27.220]  This question was inspired by my friend, GreenVet88224, who did send me a question that I just skipped
[22:27.220 --> 22:31.040]  right over because I wanted to get right to the topic.
[22:31.040 --> 22:35.060]  The leaves can take the nutrients, helps move immobile nutrients.
[22:35.060 --> 22:37.880]  You can feed while the roots are saturated.
[22:37.880 --> 22:38.880]  What else did I write?
[22:38.880 --> 22:40.680]  You can overfeed, so be careful.
[22:40.680 --> 22:45.720]  It's a good way to get pesticides and push products together.
[22:45.720 --> 22:47.680]  And don't over spray your buds.
[22:47.680 --> 22:50.120]  It looks like I have covered all of my notes.
[22:50.120 --> 22:54.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers, clone
[22:54.920 --> 23:00.400]  cutters, pollen chuckers, foliar feeders, and root feeders, I want to thank every one
[23:00.400 --> 23:04.240]  of you once again for listening to another episode of this podcast.
[23:04.240 --> 23:06.440]  I said episode, what number is this?
[23:06.440 --> 23:07.440]  708.
[23:07.720 --> 23:11.520]  That is incredible to me to have gotten to 708 episodes.
[23:11.520 --> 23:15.320]  I could not have done it without each and every one of you listening, watching, clicking
[23:15.320 --> 23:18.160]  like, clicking subscribe, supporting me.
[23:18.160 --> 23:20.120]  Thank you, I do appreciate it.
[23:20.120 --> 23:21.760]  Really thank you, thank you.
[23:21.760 --> 23:23.400]  I'm going to keep it going as long as I can.
[23:23.400 --> 23:27.920]  I've got another episode lined up for you talking about prepping for 710.
[23:27.920 --> 23:31.480]  Then the 710 episode is going to be marvelous.
[23:31.480 --> 23:33.840]  We've got our friends, Roz and Ryan joining us.
[23:33.840 --> 23:36.720]  And of course, Pedro from Pedro's Grow Room.
[23:36.720 --> 23:41.600]  Roz and his legal fuckers, whatever you want to call Pedro, I call him my friend Pedro.
[23:41.600 --> 23:42.800]  He's got a lot of cool names.
[23:42.800 --> 23:46.320]  Both of those great gentlemen will be on the show for episode 710.
[23:46.320 --> 23:48.160]  So I've got a lot of great shit lined up for you.
[23:48.160 --> 23:51.080]  I should quit rambling because this was a good podcast.
[23:51.080 --> 23:53.440]  All we can do is ruin it from here.
[23:53.440 --> 23:54.560]  Thanks again for listening.
