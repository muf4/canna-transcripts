[02:37.420 --> 02:41.700]  here in the grow from your heart studio. All right, I don't want to ramble too much. I
[02:41.700 --> 02:45.100]  think I got rambling in the last episode so I'm going to try to keep this one kind of
[02:45.100 --> 02:49.020]  tight but every time I say that it's like I jinx myself every time I say let's keep
[02:49.020 --> 02:52.860]  it quick and tight and do a quick episode that is when I go off the rails. I do want
[02:52.860 --> 02:55.380]  to keep it kind of quick kind of tight in this one because I want to make sure to get
[02:55.380 --> 03:01.180]  this camera and this camera synced up and edited properly into a proper multicam show.
[03:01.180 --> 03:04.020]  We'll see what we do you guys will know how it went when the show comes out if I'm just
[03:04.020 --> 03:07.580]  staring one direction something went awry and I got some work to do we'll figure it
[03:07.580 --> 03:11.180]  out you guys I'm having nothing but fun learning all of this gear. Nothing but fun. It's a
[03:11.180 --> 03:15.460]  good time. I love all this tech toys. We live in the future and it's fucking amazing.
[03:15.460 --> 03:20.000]  All right, so I did say I was going to jump into the second half of the questions from
[03:20.000 --> 03:26.060]  our friend Billy podunk from the last episode and the last episode Billy did ask why a golden
[03:26.060 --> 03:30.300]  goat bat cross and I took a little bit of time to explain why a golden goat bat cross
[03:30.300 --> 03:35.980]  I got a lot of great feedback on that one. Then we asked why the story of golden goat.
[03:35.980 --> 03:40.300]  I talked a little bit about the story of golden goat. Then the next question is can you tell
[03:40.420 --> 03:45.100]  the story of daybreaker and that does segue into can you talk about the story of a rise
[03:45.100 --> 03:50.860]  because of course a rise is golden goat and daybreaker. So let's talk a little bit about
[03:50.860 --> 03:56.420]  daybreaker daybreaker is another strain that once again, I acquired from another source.
[03:56.420 --> 04:00.540]  The golden goat was a gift from my friend pineapple Express shout out to that dude.
[04:00.540 --> 04:05.020]  If you're around hope you're well brother. The daybreaker was a gift from our friends
[04:05.020 --> 04:09.860]  at gauge green genetics gauge green genetics is another seed company. They're doing a lot
[04:09.860 --> 04:16.500]  of things. They actually inspired so I was given the daybreaker. They inspired a lot
[04:16.500 --> 04:24.660]  of my naming schemes. They had a lot of strain names with one word inspirational or motivational
[04:24.660 --> 04:28.260]  type words are words that they were using for a little while. They had a strain name
[04:28.260 --> 04:34.860]  called devotion and I just felt like when I used their strain that I should put their
[04:34.860 --> 04:39.660]  name into the works into the name of the cross to kind of honor the name of the plant which
[04:39.660 --> 04:46.060]  is why a rise daybreaker to golden goat got a one word inspirational motivational uplifting
[04:46.060 --> 04:52.240]  type feeling word of a name and a rise was the best you can do. So let's let's get back
[04:52.240 --> 04:56.280]  on track here daybreaker the story of daybreaker. Where did the daybreaker came from it came
[04:56.280 --> 05:02.480]  from gauge green genetics very innovative folks in the cannabis business gauge green
[05:02.480 --> 05:07.140]  genetics not the other gauge. There's a lot of other fake gauges out there. They are gauge
[05:07.140 --> 05:11.940]  green genetics has been around for a long time. That's the O.G. gauge. So daybreaker
[05:11.940 --> 05:19.300]  daybreaker is a chem D female. We got the chem dog D female pollinated by a Joseph O.G.
[05:19.300 --> 05:24.700]  male. I do not know the entire story of the Joseph O.G. male that was not my O.G. male
[05:24.700 --> 05:31.320]  plant to the best of my knowledge. That was an O.G. male gifted to the gauge green genetics
[05:31.320 --> 05:37.560]  group or the gauge green group. There's mainly a couple of guys Mike and key play that are
[05:37.560 --> 05:41.680]  mainly gauge green genetics and I'm just speaking to the best of my knowledge. I could be wrong
[05:41.680 --> 05:45.760]  about anything with gauge green. That's not my company just people that I've worked with
[05:45.760 --> 05:51.920]  people in the industry. So gauge green is mainly Mike and key play and they run gauge
[05:51.920 --> 05:57.560]  green. I got off topic of where I was going there. Anyway I acquired the so they got the
[05:57.560 --> 06:02.440]  Joseph O.G. that's where I was. They got the Joseph O.G. male to the best of my knowledge.
[06:02.440 --> 06:08.200]  Joseph O.G. came from their friend Joseph who unfortunately passed away is the story
[06:08.200 --> 06:13.720]  that I was told all of that is cannabis legend and story. I don't have any verification of
[06:13.720 --> 06:16.920]  that. That's the best of what I know. I like to tell you the story behind a strain in a
[06:16.920 --> 06:22.720]  plant. So there was Joseph who gave the Joseph O.G. to our friends at the gauge green group
[06:23.520 --> 06:29.920]  then use the Joseph O.G. to pollinate a chem D. The chem D. of course sought out or searched
[06:29.920 --> 06:34.760]  out chem dog strain from chem dog and the legend of the 13 beans. If you have not done
[06:34.760 --> 06:39.280]  the research on chem dog and the legend of the 13 beans I definitely recommend that story.
[06:39.280 --> 06:41.880]  It's all over the Internet somewhere that stuff you should know if you're interested
[06:41.880 --> 06:48.880]  in cannabis. So our folks at gauge green group took the Joseph O.G. that's probably an O.G.
[06:49.680 --> 06:54.840]  they called it O.G. that's an O.G. Kush. Then they pollinated that to the chem D. That made
[06:54.840 --> 07:01.400]  Daybreaker seeds. Daybreaker was a great cross. Why did I love the Daybreaker? Why did I personally
[07:01.400 --> 07:05.980]  love the Daybreaker? I had a couple of female phenotypes and of course I had a male which
[07:05.980 --> 07:11.280]  I used for breeding which we'll talk about in a little bit. The female phenotypes had
[07:11.280 --> 07:18.280]  a gassy like a fresh rubber burnt tennis ball kind of a smell. If you open up a chem it
[07:18.880 --> 07:23.160]  kind of tennis balls there's a very distinct smell that kind of comes out distinct right.
[07:23.160 --> 07:28.760]  It's got stink in it. This smell comes out and it just smells really it's a pungent rubbery
[07:28.760 --> 07:33.840]  dry but pungent smell. It's almost got a gassiness sort of a thing to it. Sometimes when I buy
[07:33.840 --> 07:40.400]  new stickers if I get bulk stickers from a sticker printer sometimes they have a skunky
[07:40.400 --> 07:44.820]  chemically sort of a smell to it and that's kind of what a lot of these Daybreaker phenotypes
[07:44.820 --> 07:50.460]  are smelling like. It was gassy it was funky. I describe it as cushy and diesel which makes
[07:50.460 --> 07:54.620]  sense because there's cush and chem in there. It's got those flavors but if you don't know
[07:54.620 --> 07:58.700]  what cush and chem smell like then you've got to make those up as well. So it's like
[07:58.700 --> 08:02.960]  chemicals and burnt plastic and tennis balls and all kinds of wonderful terrible smells
[08:02.960 --> 08:09.380]  come from there. Swampy foot aromas dirty armpit aromas body odors a lot of that sort
[08:09.380 --> 08:13.420]  of stuff. The leaves on these plants were gigantic. The leaves that were coming from
[08:13.420 --> 08:18.020]  the Daybreaker seeds the plants were gigantic. You could serve fucking dinner on the sides
[08:18.020 --> 08:21.860]  of these leaves. They were dinner plates which leads into later on why I chose to use this
[08:21.860 --> 08:28.120]  plant for breeding. It would make beautiful purple colors but it did have like a stretchy
[08:28.120 --> 08:33.300]  sort of a structure just that OG cush sort of a thing that OG cush does. It doesn't
[08:33.300 --> 08:39.880]  manura out like some of your more sought after stretchy kind of shaped plants. The sought
[08:39.880 --> 08:43.060]  after shape is what I was trying to say. My brain is really ahead of me today. I know
[08:43.060 --> 08:46.780]  what I'm trying to say but my fucking mouth can't keep up. It makes more of a lanky stretchy
[08:46.780 --> 08:51.160]  sort of a thing but it's worth it because the quality of the buds that it puts out are
[08:51.160 --> 08:56.220]  so pungent and so delicious. It's got like burnt rubber and moth balls and chocolate
[08:56.220 --> 09:00.460]  and all that chemically stuff going on but then they're just little dense golf balls
[09:00.460 --> 09:04.920]  that are so hard and so coated in resin that when you put them in a bag like two little
[09:04.920 --> 09:07.840]  nugs is an eighth and people are like that's not an eighth bro and they put it on the scale
[09:07.840 --> 09:11.920]  and it weighs four and they're like holy shit. Like I just it was just such good herb and
[09:11.920 --> 09:16.940]  for the era when I found it and discovered it that's when the cush and the rock buds
[09:16.940 --> 09:21.020]  and the tight dense shit that's when that was super popular. So the Daybreaker was great
[09:21.020 --> 09:26.200]  for that OG stank funk stuff. So that is the Daybreaker. Let's talk a little bit about
[09:26.200 --> 09:31.640]  Daybreaker was the first question. The story of the Daybreaker. I don't know the inspiration
[09:31.640 --> 09:35.920]  behind breeding that. I don't know that. That wasn't my work. I acquired a package of seeds.
[09:35.920 --> 09:42.160]  I was a tester for the Gage Green Group for a really long time. They sent me the Starlet
[09:42.160 --> 09:47.200]  Cush. I used the Starlet Cush. I was a tester of that one and I actually took photos of
[09:47.200 --> 09:50.880]  that and sent those to Gage and they put that they didn't put them on there. They submitted
[09:50.880 --> 09:57.160]  them to Skunk Magazine and humble brag my photos of Gage Green Group's Starlet Cush
[09:57.160 --> 10:01.880]  was on the cover and the centerfold of Skunk Magazine. So most of the time when you're
[10:01.880 --> 10:06.420]  looking up Starlet Cush from Gage Green Group most of those photos you see will be my photos
[10:06.420 --> 10:11.960]  with the red background with the blue background. Those are my photos. Big up big thanks for
[10:11.960 --> 10:17.760]  the checking out my photos, but I was a tester for Gage. I tested a lot of stuff for Gage
[10:17.760 --> 10:20.720]  a lot of winners some things that I wouldn't have told them to put out and he listened.
[10:20.720 --> 10:25.440]  He took good advice. They took good advice. They took my word. They used what I had to
[10:25.440 --> 10:30.560]  say as input. They didn't just discredit me. So after testing for them for a long time
[10:30.680 --> 10:33.880]  they just started sending me stuff randomly and then I got a pack of Daybreaker and thought
[10:33.880 --> 10:37.520]  I'm going to grow the shit out of these because I like the description. I grew it and found
[10:37.520 --> 10:41.200]  a couple of great females that stuck around for a little bit. I grew them. I worked with
[10:41.200 --> 10:45.480]  them. I smoked them. I played with them. I shared clones of those, but I found a male
[10:45.480 --> 10:52.520]  that was just amazing. Most of what I'm known for breeding is very sativa heavy. It's got
[10:52.520 --> 10:56.880]  that panic attack. It's got the longer skinny leaves. It grows tall and skinny and I was
[10:56.880 --> 11:00.800]  kind of breeding myself into a box with a lot of that stuff. I was just breeding the
[11:00.800 --> 11:05.560]  same thing. The Lemon Jeffrey, the Golden Goat Crosses, a lot of Golden Goat Crosses.
[11:05.560 --> 11:10.000]  So it was all coming out kind of kind of going the same direction and I wanted to try something
[11:10.000 --> 11:15.240]  new. Also I had in mind of making a couple of Bat Crosses and other things. So I saw
[11:15.240 --> 11:21.080]  this Daybreaker male with these big wide fan leaves and these purple colors and it didn't
[11:21.080 --> 11:25.800]  want to drink. The Daybreaker just doesn't want water. You can not feed that bitch for
[11:25.840 --> 11:30.480]  twice as long as all the other plants. Not water her and she will be just fine. When
[11:30.480 --> 11:34.680]  you do water her, the leaves stay droopy because the leaves are so big that when you water
[11:34.680 --> 11:38.160]  her, the leaves would just stay there. She looked angry when you'd water her. That plant
[11:38.160 --> 11:42.200]  wanted it really, really dry and that's a good trait because that buys me time. That
[11:42.200 --> 11:46.320]  means the offspring later possibly won't need as much water. I can water it and then actually
[11:46.320 --> 11:50.400]  go for a couple of days without having to water those plants. I can go take a break,
[11:50.400 --> 11:55.680]  go on vacation, maybe go see fish, maybe go do some stuff. So I saw this Daybreaker plant
[11:55.680 --> 11:59.880]  and I saw this male plant and this male plant that was coming out when I would rub the stem,
[11:59.880 --> 12:05.720]  it smelled disgusting. It had the most pungent, disgusting aromas coming out of it and I thought
[12:05.720 --> 12:10.640]  this is a breeder plant. I need to breed with this. It was making purple colors. I was making
[12:10.640 --> 12:16.520]  trichomes at a beautiful shape, a beautiful structure. It was just as a breeder, I knew
[12:16.520 --> 12:21.680]  this dude right here needs to do some fucking pollen chucking in this room. So I put him
[12:21.680 --> 12:27.960]  in a room with several females. A lot of the stuff never got put out. The Daybreaker crosses,
[12:27.960 --> 12:33.360]  there were probably, when I make a cross, I don't just put one female in the room. That's not like
[12:33.360 --> 12:36.440]  that. That's cool. You're going to make a new cross, but why not put seven or eight females
[12:36.440 --> 12:40.760]  in there? Whatever your legal limit, whatever your space limit is, something like that. Put a lot in
[12:40.760 --> 12:44.840]  there. Make a lot of seeds. If you're going to do it, do it. So I had a lot of females in the room
[12:44.840 --> 12:51.480]  at the time. There was a Girl Scout cookies plant in the room. That one got called Coffee Cake. The
[12:51.480 --> 12:57.080]  Girl Scout cookies to Daybreaker. There were a lot in there. I can't even remember all of them
[12:57.080 --> 13:02.480]  right now. Flow to Daybreaker. There was a bunch of good shit in there. There was a lot of good
[13:02.480 --> 13:08.080]  shit in there. I still have a lot of it also. Now my inbox is going to blow up. But Coffee Cake,
[13:08.080 --> 13:13.920]  you guys. Anyway, so I thought I'm going to put the Golden Goat in there because Golden Goat,
[13:13.920 --> 13:20.000]  my selections on breeding are very important in my opinion. Selection is key. It was very
[13:20.000 --> 13:24.760]  important that I chose good breeding plants. I put Golden Goat in there because Golden Goat was
[13:24.760 --> 13:30.360]  so completely different from this Daybreaker plant. Why would I want to make Daybreaker to
[13:30.360 --> 13:35.800]  Daybreaker? Why would I want to put Chocolate Mothballs, Gas and Funk to more Chocolate Mothballs,
[13:35.800 --> 13:40.840]  Gas and Funk? That's going to come out the same thing or the breeding is going to be so weird that
[13:40.840 --> 13:46.560]  those two, all those powerful traits, the Gas Mothballs, Funk, Chocolate, Tennis Balls, all
[13:46.560 --> 13:49.200]  those terps are going to meet in the middle and they're just going to cancel each other out and
[13:49.200 --> 13:52.880]  it's going to come out smelling like raspberries or something. Like weird shit like that happens
[13:52.880 --> 13:58.160]  in breeding. What I would rather do is take this Chocolate Funk and mix it into other things like
[13:58.160 --> 14:02.400]  the Strawberry Starburst. You get Strawberry Chocolate Funk. The Girl Scout Cookies, it was
[14:02.400 --> 14:06.640]  kind of similar there. But you know, you got to cross everything to the fucking cookies. The
[14:06.640 --> 14:10.720]  Platinum Tangy because then you get the Orange to the Chocolate Funk. That's kind of my idea when
[14:10.720 --> 14:14.560]  I'm breeding to the Lemon Skunk. There is actually Daybreaker to Lemon Skunk. Those seeds really do
[14:14.560 --> 14:19.360]  exist. But things like that so that I can make new shit. I don't want to just replicate and
[14:19.360 --> 14:26.080]  duplicate all the terps that are already happening. There's enough dessert and gas and fucking kush
[14:26.080 --> 14:30.960]  kind of smells like there's already cake and fucking Twinkies and terps that's already happening
[14:30.960 --> 14:35.840]  everywhere. So I want to make some new shit. I try to open up my breeding, not bottle neck myself
[14:35.840 --> 14:41.120]  into one direction. So selecting this Golden Goat to the Daybreaker, I knew there was going to be
[14:41.120 --> 14:45.680]  some amazing shit coming out of that. The Golden Goat, we've talked about her. High potency.
[14:45.680 --> 14:50.880]  Everything I breed to the Golden Goat comes out highly potent. Golden Goat to itself, Golden Goat
[14:50.880 --> 14:56.320]  as a male, Golden Goat as a female. Anything I breed with the Golden Goat, it comes out magical.
[14:56.320 --> 15:04.800]  So I took the Daybreaker male, beautiful structure, stank ass aroma, making purple colors,
[15:04.800 --> 15:09.200]  purple trichomes. The leaves were purple, big giant leaves. The leaves would turn black and
[15:09.200 --> 15:13.600]  start crinkling up toward the end of the flowering phase. I took this male and I put him in a room
[15:13.600 --> 15:18.000]  with all these other girls and in that room was the Golden Goat. So we did some pollen chucking.
[15:18.000 --> 15:25.200]  Now we have got a Golden Goat female pollinated by that Daybreaker male. That made a rise. What a
[15:25.200 --> 15:30.160]  rise. One of my flagship strains, one of my most popular strains. A rise tested at, I don't even
[15:30.160 --> 15:33.280]  want to say the numbers without pulling it up somewhere because nobody ever believes me, it was
[15:33.280 --> 15:40.320]  35.84% THCA. It was grown by our friends at Organtica in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I think
[15:40.320 --> 15:44.160]  Miles was in charge of that grow. Either way, I know Miles touched it and it was all his fault
[15:44.160 --> 15:48.720]  that it was really good. Shout out to my buddy Miles. Big up to Tim. Shout out to the entire
[15:48.720 --> 15:51.920]  Organtica crew. Shout out to everybody out there in Albuquerque. Hope you're doing well. Big up to
[15:51.920 --> 16:01.120]  New Mexico. Cannabis legalization. What? Good job, you guys. Where the hell was I? A rise, a rise.
[16:01.120 --> 16:06.160]  Daybreaker and Golden Goat cross, right? A rise was Golden Goat and Daybreaker. I knew
[16:06.160 --> 16:11.120]  that it was going to be a champion. I grew a bunch of seeds out of that out immediately.
[16:11.120 --> 16:16.080]  And very early on, they were just taking off. They were just going, most of the other seeds.
[16:16.960 --> 16:21.200]  I buy seeds from other breeders. I pop a lot of other seeds. I've bred a lot of other seeds.
[16:21.200 --> 16:26.160]  Other seeds in that room were just not doing what a rise was doing. A rise was a rising to
[16:26.160 --> 16:30.160]  the occasion. She was fucking taken off. He was taken off. There were boys and girls in there.
[16:30.160 --> 16:34.080]  They were all exploding with growth. And I was like, I think I'm onto something here.
[16:34.080 --> 16:37.200]  And I watched a few of the other crosses in the room and they were growing. They were doing their
[16:37.200 --> 16:44.160]  thing. But that a rise just kept going and going. Every phenotype I grew of that was a winner. I
[16:44.160 --> 16:51.120]  couldn't find one from that batch of a rise that I didn't want to keep. The first batch was labeled
[16:51.120 --> 16:59.600]  A, B, C, D, E, all the way up to G, I think. A and E were kept around for a very, very long time.
[16:59.600 --> 17:06.800]  F was around for quite a while. I've made F2s of A and E and F, and possibly a couple others that
[17:06.800 --> 17:13.600]  I don't talk about as much. Then from another batch, I discovered number four and number eight.
[17:13.600 --> 17:19.600]  And these are females. These were all female arise crosses, arise F1s that I was keeping around.
[17:20.960 --> 17:27.200]  I've made F2s with the same male, the Solomon male, the male that's been dubbed Solomon,
[17:27.200 --> 17:33.920]  but I kept him around. I made F2s of the number eight, the number four, the number seven, E, A,
[17:33.920 --> 17:38.080]  F, possibly G. That sounds like a fucking guitar chord right there. E, A, F, G. It sounds like a
[17:38.080 --> 17:43.680]  fucking guitar structure, chord structure. But I made F2s of a lot of those. There were so many
[17:43.680 --> 17:48.400]  good phenotypes around that I just couldn't... There were subtle differences, but so many
[17:48.400 --> 17:52.720]  similarities. Some were kind of more Golden Goat, some were kind of more OG Kush. And if you smoke
[17:52.720 --> 17:56.720]  OG Kush or Chemdog, you get fucking high as shit from those. If you smoke Golden Goat, you get high
[17:56.720 --> 18:01.280]  as shit. So either buzz was completely desirable. Sometimes I'm sitting on... Would end up sitting on
[18:01.280 --> 18:05.200]  the couch. Sometimes I'd end up fucking saying, I'm going to go sit down and watch TV. And I'd
[18:05.200 --> 18:09.200]  end up in the kitchen cooking food and cleaning the basement all at the same fucking time.
[18:09.200 --> 18:13.040]  So it was like, it was just tremendous herb. Every phenotype had something to offer.
[18:13.760 --> 18:19.680]  The smells were like sweet Kush. How can you go wrong with sweetness and Kush? So that was Arise.
[18:20.480 --> 18:26.400]  Then we'll talk about the Arise male who was known as King Solomon. I found a boy in that
[18:26.400 --> 18:31.360]  batch of seeds. I actually pheno-hunted a boy out of that batch of seeds. I went through several
[18:31.360 --> 18:37.120]  seeds looking for the perfect male because I knew, I just knew there was a male in that batch of
[18:37.120 --> 18:42.640]  seeds that was going to pass on the magic that I saw in that original cross. When I first grew
[18:42.640 --> 18:47.920]  that first batch of F1 Arise seeds, I saw them like, they didn't come out of the soil. They
[18:47.920 --> 18:52.640]  fucking kicked the soil out of the way. And they came out screaming like, we're fucking here and
[18:52.640 --> 18:56.720]  we're going to grow and you cannot stop us. And I was like, holy shit, these plants are onto
[18:56.720 --> 19:00.640]  something. I thought they were all boys because usually male plants grow with that kind of vigor,
[19:00.640 --> 19:06.560]  but these female and male plants were all just taken off. So I wanted to make that vigor continue.
[19:06.560 --> 19:11.040]  So I found a few of my favorite female plants. Of course, that's how I do it. Like I said before,
[19:11.040 --> 19:14.640]  if I'm going to pollinate something, I'm going to pollinate a whole bunch of fucking somethings.
[19:14.640 --> 19:19.680]  So I found my Daybreaker male and I put a bunch of ladies in the room and I just started pollinating
[19:19.680 --> 19:26.000]  things. And here we are today. I've got probably, I want to say that King Solomon is probably
[19:26.000 --> 19:34.800]  responsible for nearly a hundred crosses. Probably 50 of them have been released. Probably maybe
[19:34.800 --> 19:41.840]  close to that. I don't know. But that Daybreaker pollinated the Golden Goat, made Arise. Arise was,
[19:41.840 --> 19:47.200]  I selected a male. He has been called Solomon. If you read about King Solomon, ladies were his
[19:47.200 --> 19:51.600]  weakness. He could have had anything he wanted. He wanted a lot of ladies. I thought my male plant
[19:51.600 --> 19:55.280]  should be named Solomon because he's got a lot of kids everywhere, just like Solomon did.
[19:56.160 --> 20:01.680]  That's some Rasta shit right there for you. A peek into my little Rasta brain. Anyway, that is
[20:01.680 --> 20:06.960]  the story you guys of Daybreaker. Daybreaker is not really my story to tell. That's another breeder
[20:06.960 --> 20:12.560]  story. I gave you my experience with it. I know that it came from the Gage Green group. It came
[20:12.560 --> 20:17.280]  from Mike and Keyplay. I got the seeds because I used to be a tester. I did not test the Daybreaker.
[20:17.280 --> 20:21.680]  I would not have bred with it had I tested it. It was already out. It was given as a gift. Free
[20:21.680 --> 20:26.000]  reign on breeding with that one. I don't think you should breed with a tester. That's just another
[20:26.000 --> 20:30.880]  thing. So I got that one. I grew it. I fucking saw great potential in it. There's just something
[20:30.880 --> 20:35.680]  about, I'm like a cannabis matchmaker. When I see two plants, I'm just like, dude, these two plants.
[20:35.680 --> 20:40.960]  It's like fucking those people with matchmaking services or date makers or hooker up friends. You
[20:40.960 --> 20:44.880]  ever have friends that are trying to hook up to your friends like, yo, Bill and Susan should date.
[20:44.880 --> 20:48.320]  And then they do. And they hit it off. You're like, how the fuck did you know that? I just know that
[20:48.320 --> 20:53.200]  I'm that kind of guy. I know that shit. I know that if plant a and plant B do the horizontal
[20:53.200 --> 20:58.080]  mambo, I know that their kids are going to be beautiful. Also, I'm at an advantage. I'm kind
[20:58.080 --> 21:03.120]  of cheating at this point. I know that my male plant, Solomon, is fucking magic. Anything that
[21:03.120 --> 21:07.360]  old Saul touches, he's going to turn into magic. He's just got the magic fucking, he's got the
[21:07.360 --> 21:12.880]  Midas touch, bro. Uh, he pollinates female plants and the offspring is just fucking awesome. Also,
[21:13.600 --> 21:20.160]  I've got access to some of the most elite female plants on the planet. I've got access to a lot of
[21:20.160 --> 21:26.240]  stuff. I've got friends that will acquire or get me things. However I ask, I can get whatever I
[21:26.240 --> 21:30.880]  want you guys. And people return me clones of things. If I breed something and they grow it,
[21:30.880 --> 21:34.720]  and they find something stellar. A lot of times people offer to return me a clone. I've been
[21:34.720 --> 21:38.960]  taking more people up on those offers so that I could do some more reversals and some different
[21:38.960 --> 21:44.320]  projects. But so I've got female clones, female plants that have been tried, true, tested. They've
[21:44.320 --> 21:49.840]  been through the ringer. I also have a lot of experience in the commercial cultivation. Uh,
[21:49.840 --> 21:53.520]  what is it industry here in Colorado? So I've been to a lot of commercial grows and I went to a lot
[21:53.520 --> 21:58.000]  of them for extended periods of time. I would go to this one place for maybe a four to eight,
[21:58.000 --> 22:02.960]  maybe a 12, 16 week contract, uh, maybe a two harvest full complete harvest contract. And I
[22:02.960 --> 22:08.560]  get to see their plants for two full harvests once or twice a week. Um, by then you learn that
[22:08.560 --> 22:12.960]  plant sucks. That plant's awesome. That plant sucks. That plant's awesome. That one right there
[22:12.960 --> 22:17.600]  talks to me, that plant right there says something. Can I get a clone of that? And then somehow we
[22:17.600 --> 22:22.000]  managed to get me a clone. I get it in my fucking personal grow. We get rid of all the problems that
[22:22.000 --> 22:26.880]  came with that clone because it came from that dispensary grow and clean it up, breed to it.
[22:26.880 --> 22:31.360]  And while we've got another magic ingredient to make more magic, my plants have been vetted and
[22:31.360 --> 22:35.600]  tested. I am kind of cheating, but I know that I've got successful breeding plants because of
[22:35.600 --> 22:42.080]  that. So that is the story of a rise. She tests super high. There's a full podcast about a rise,
[22:42.800 --> 22:47.440]  but I do enjoy kind of revisiting because it's been years since I did that podcast. That episode
[22:47.440 --> 22:53.760]  definitely wasn't a video podcast. Uh, arise eats very heavy arise gets pretty tall. Uh, she takes
[22:53.760 --> 22:58.240]  well to defoliation. She can handle high temperatures. Uh, right now it's probably
[22:58.240 --> 23:02.240]  kind of hard to get a rise. There are not a lot of seeds left, especially after this episode
[23:02.240 --> 23:07.760]  airs, they will sell out everywhere. If it's not already sold out, uh, seeds here now.com. Also
[23:07.760 --> 23:11.760]  check out I read genetics.com for a list of vendors and opportunities where you can find a
[23:11.760 --> 23:15.600]  rise, not just a rise, but all of the strains that I'm putting out. I was going to wrap up the
[23:15.600 --> 23:20.160]  podcast, but since I'm teasing out a teasing strains that I'm putting out coming soon, you
[23:20.160 --> 23:24.800]  guys, if you've listened to this far into this ramble cast of an episode coming very soon to
[23:24.880 --> 23:28.240]  new strains from my region. If you've been watching social media, you may have seen me
[23:28.240 --> 23:32.080]  test these a couple of times. A few people out there are testing them. I'm waiting for some
[23:32.080 --> 23:37.680]  photos from other great testers. These will be released. I want to say fall, maybe winter of
[23:37.680 --> 23:42.240]  this year, if not early next year, I do need to make more. Uh, they're in the process. It just
[23:42.240 --> 23:45.840]  takes time and it's, it's honestly just me. I got to package it all up, got to get it going,
[23:45.840 --> 23:49.760]  but they're coming. So let's talk about two new strains coming from my region. I'm proud to
[23:49.760 --> 23:52.880]  announce I'm going to use camera two for this one. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm proud to announce
[23:52.880 --> 23:57.120]  the names of a couple of strains that I've been teasing and hinting at you for quite a while.
[23:57.120 --> 24:02.160]  There's a cross it is, uh, which one do we do first? I've got notes here. The first one,
[24:02.160 --> 24:06.800]  I have taken a biscotti female. That's right. I've got the biscotti. Biscotti is an amazing
[24:06.800 --> 24:11.600]  plant, super dense, bud, uh, pastry flavors. It's called biscotti for a reason. Shout out to my
[24:11.600 --> 24:18.640]  buddy double door dank for throwing me that clone. The biscotti has been pollinated by the arise.
[24:18.640 --> 24:24.960]  So it is biscotti to arise. I use that King Solomon arise cut. Uh, he's reliable. These
[24:24.960 --> 24:31.680]  plants put off confusing aromas. It's like skunky pastries. It's like chemical. It's like chemical
[24:31.680 --> 24:38.000]  pastry, electrical fire and a pastry and crayons or something. It's really crazy smells. Um, that
[24:38.000 --> 24:44.480]  one is called Saka souffle. And if you get Saka souffle more power to you, if you don't get Saka
[24:44.480 --> 24:49.440]  souffle, that's just, you'll be okay. The strain will still grow for you. Now the other strain
[24:49.440 --> 24:55.040]  that I want to announce the name of, uh, I was, uh, gifted a clone of the chem de la chem. That
[24:55.040 --> 25:02.000]  is chem D. Uh, it is chem D crossed to the I 95 that comes from, uh, JJ from top dog genetics.
[25:02.000 --> 25:06.480]  You guys know how much I appreciate JJ. Great breeding, great plants, uh, great parent plants.
[25:06.480 --> 25:09.600]  So the breeding is always going to be solid with that guy. And he's not going to put out anything
[25:09.600 --> 25:14.960]  that isn't fucking stellar. I've taken the chem de la chem. And of course I pollinated that one as
[25:14.960 --> 25:21.040]  well with the King Solomon cut of my arise, the male, the popular King Solomon, the popular arise.
[25:21.600 --> 25:28.880]  Uh, that one is called the machine. So we've got Saka souffle and the machine coming soon.
[25:29.600 --> 25:37.520]  Once again, Saka souffle is biscotti to arise. The machine is chem de la chem to arise. Uh, both
[25:37.520 --> 25:42.720]  are wonderful strains. They pass my testing requirements, uh, great plants, good vigor,
[25:42.720 --> 25:49.600]  good potency, good turps. Uh, they qualify to be in my garden. They qualify to be in your garden.
[25:49.600 --> 25:53.280]  Big shout out to all the test growers who helped me out to get these strains out to market.
[25:53.280 --> 25:58.080]  A wonderful test growers, wonderful grow reports, great photos. Uh, thank you. I truly appreciate
[25:58.080 --> 26:02.960]  it. And don't be offended if you have not been selected as a test grower yet, there's always
[26:02.960 --> 26:08.240]  new shit coming. Uh, pandemic year slowed down a lot of stuff. You guys, maybe next year you'll
[26:08.240 --> 26:12.160]  get an opportunity to be a tester. Keep those tester applications coming. There is a full
[26:12.160 --> 26:16.880]  podcast about being an IRI genetics tester. Don't be shy. Keep those coming. I do still have them
[26:16.880 --> 26:21.920]  on file. I do not delete them. I do not throw them away. There's a folder in my Mac book called,
[26:21.920 --> 26:26.080]  uh, tester applications. It's in there when I need testers, I start at the top and just start
[26:26.080 --> 26:30.400]  reading. I got a few set to one side. You're going to be next. I got a big pile to go through.
[26:30.400 --> 26:34.560]  I do not have a reject pile. You go to the bottom, maybe one day I'll email you and go,
[26:34.560 --> 26:38.720]  Hey, you grow any more plants. You do any better. You make any changes. What's new in your grow.
[26:38.720 --> 26:42.880]  Maybe you'll get the opportunity to be a tester at that point, but don't be discouraged. If you
[26:42.880 --> 26:47.840]  haven't been selected as a test grower for IRI genetics yet, the future is wide open.
[26:47.840 --> 26:51.520]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers,
[26:51.520 --> 26:55.040]  clone cutters, Paul and chuckers, all you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out there.
[26:55.040 --> 26:58.720]  I want to thank you again for listening to another episode of the grow from your heart podcast. If
[26:58.720 --> 27:02.320]  you have any questions, corrections, comments, or concerns, you know, you can send me an email.

[27:07.600 --> 27:12.560]  ego. It will be okay. Let me know how you feel about the show. Also, if you want to help the
[27:12.560 --> 27:16.080]  show out, if you learned a couple of things, if you feel like the show is educational,
[27:16.080 --> 27:19.680]  informative, entertaining, maybe I rescued your garden. Maybe I told you some cool stories.
[27:20.320 --> 27:23.680]  Maybe you just want to throw me a tip just because you thought I was cool or something.
[27:23.680 --> 27:28.800]  The link is in the Patreon. It's patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart. Don't be shy.

[27:37.680 --> 27:42.240]  appreciate you. Also check out my website, ieregenetics.com. Lots of cool shit going on
[27:42.240 --> 27:46.640]  on there. I talk about that enough. Don't need to ramble about the website again. That is all I've
[27:46.640 --> 27:50.960]  got for you for this episode. The next episode will feature my buddy, White Mike. We're going
[27:50.960 --> 27:57.200]  to talk about a recent rule change here in the Colorado medical marijuana rule scene. What is it
[27:57.200 --> 28:03.200]  called? Atmosphere, environment, vacana space, whatever. I was doing so good until now I fell
[28:03.200 --> 28:07.360]  apart here at the end. You guys, it is time to go take some dabs. Thank you for hanging out.
[28:07.360 --> 28:11.360]  I want to give a giant shout out to my buddy, Black Thumb Grower. Until next time, take a fat
