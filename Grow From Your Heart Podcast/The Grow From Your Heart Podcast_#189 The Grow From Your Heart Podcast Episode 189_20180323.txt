[00:17.020 --> 00:19.580]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:19.580 --> 00:21.580]  It's time for episode number 189
[00:21.580 --> 00:23.380]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:23.380 --> 00:27.020]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.020 --> 00:28.160]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:28.160 --> 00:29.380]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.380 --> 00:31.780]  if you're a news smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:31.780 --> 00:33.140]  if you're a cannabis activist
[00:33.140 --> 00:34.580]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:34.580 --> 00:36.380]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:36.380 --> 00:38.660]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:39.700 --> 00:41.660]  I'm your host, my friends call me Ross DiGiappone.
[00:41.660 --> 00:43.340]  I thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:43.340 --> 00:45.540]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:45.540 --> 00:47.100]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:47.100 --> 00:49.420]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:49.420 --> 00:53.280]  Big thanks to Kat, Ku, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:53.280 --> 00:58.020]  I hope everybody's smoking on something delicious with me.
[00:58.020 --> 00:59.460]  I hope you're rolling up a fat joint.
[00:59.460 --> 01:01.180]  I hope you got a blunt twisted.
[01:01.180 --> 01:02.880]  Maybe you're smoking some shatter.
[01:05.020 --> 01:08.580]  Today, tonight, I am smoking some apothecary extracts,
[01:08.580 --> 01:10.540]  lemon Jeffrey live batter.
[01:10.540 --> 01:11.860]  I picked this up at a dispensary
[01:11.860 --> 01:13.980]  in Colorado Springs called Elevations.
[01:14.020 --> 01:15.660]  Big shout out to everybody at Elevations.
[01:15.660 --> 01:17.540]  Today was my first time there.
[01:17.540 --> 01:18.540]  It was an amazing visit.
[01:18.540 --> 01:20.020]  Everybody was super kind to me,
[01:20.020 --> 01:22.140]  some familiar faces and some new friends.
[01:22.140 --> 01:23.140]  I highly recommend them.
[01:23.140 --> 01:25.020]  Elevations in Colorado Springs,
[01:25.020 --> 01:27.980]  fair price and good products and a super friendly staff.
[01:27.980 --> 01:29.220]  Somebody let them know I said that.
[01:29.220 --> 01:31.220]  Let them know they got a huge compliment, please.
[01:31.220 --> 01:32.140]  Big shout out to everybody there.
[01:32.140 --> 01:33.540]  It's treated very well by everybody.
[01:33.540 --> 01:35.420]  People I knew and people I just met
[01:35.420 --> 01:36.540]  all treated me like a rock star.
[01:36.540 --> 01:37.660]  It's fucking great.
[01:37.660 --> 01:40.180]  So big shout out to Apothecary Extracts.
[01:40.180 --> 01:42.760]  They ran this lemon Jeffrey live batter.
[01:42.760 --> 01:44.160]  This stuff was delicious, you guys.
[01:44.160 --> 01:46.680]  I was at the dispensary around four o'clock this afternoon
[01:46.680 --> 01:48.360]  and this gram that I'm holding in my hand,
[01:48.360 --> 01:49.960]  this package is completely empty.
[01:49.960 --> 01:51.840]  That's how delicious this hash was.
[01:51.840 --> 01:54.360]  I just kept taking dabs because it tastes amazing.
[01:54.360 --> 01:56.600]  It tastes just like the lemon Jeffrey flowers.
[01:56.600 --> 01:58.920]  They had lemon Jeffrey flowers on the shelf, you guys.
[01:58.920 --> 01:59.880]  The flowers were beautiful.
[01:59.880 --> 02:01.200]  They were perfectly trimmed.
[02:01.200 --> 02:02.280]  They were nice and frosty.
[02:02.280 --> 02:03.220]  They were bright green,
[02:03.220 --> 02:05.080]  just like lemon Jeffrey should be done.
[02:05.080 --> 02:07.160]  Big shout out to our friends
[02:07.160 --> 02:08.840]  at Elevations in Colorado Springs.
[02:08.840 --> 02:11.560]  Also a huge shout out to Apothecary Extracts.
[02:11.560 --> 02:12.480]  Good, great work, guys.
[02:13.200 --> 02:14.040]  Everybody did great work.
[02:14.040 --> 02:16.320]  The grow had to be amazing because the material was amazing.
[02:16.320 --> 02:18.480]  And this hash is delicious.
[02:18.480 --> 02:20.040]  By the time this episode comes out,
[02:20.040 --> 02:23.360]  I assure you this product will be sold out over Elevations,
[02:23.360 --> 02:24.200]  but check them out.
[02:24.200 --> 02:25.680]  They've always got amazing products on the shelf.
[02:25.680 --> 02:27.720]  Also check out wherever you can find a drop
[02:27.720 --> 02:31.160]  of Apothecary Extracts live resin, live butter, live batter.
[02:31.160 --> 02:32.140]  I highly recommend it.
[02:32.140 --> 02:32.980]  Nice work, Woody.
[02:32.980 --> 02:33.800]  Good work, bro.
[02:33.800 --> 02:34.640]  You're doing a great job.
[02:34.640 --> 02:37.840]  Also shout out to Brandon for taking good care of me today.
[02:37.840 --> 02:38.920]  So let me explain something here.
[02:38.920 --> 02:39.840]  I said batter, right?
[02:39.840 --> 02:41.500]  I said live batter.
[02:41.540 --> 02:42.380]  People are probably going,
[02:42.380 --> 02:43.700]  what's he smoking live batter?
[02:43.700 --> 02:44.580]  So this is hash.
[02:44.580 --> 02:47.260]  This was live resin.
[02:47.260 --> 02:48.580]  I got to keep backing up steps
[02:48.580 --> 02:49.720]  because the more stuff I say,
[02:49.720 --> 02:52.140]  the more stuff I realize I need to explain.
[02:52.140 --> 02:53.380]  So these plants,
[02:53.380 --> 02:55.700]  the plants that made this material were cut down
[02:55.700 --> 02:56.980]  and the big leaves were taken off.
[02:56.980 --> 02:58.900]  Anything with trichomes were left on there.
[02:58.900 --> 03:00.700]  Those buds were frozen.
[03:00.700 --> 03:03.700]  That frozen bud was delivered to an extraction company.
[03:03.700 --> 03:05.060]  That extraction company ran it
[03:05.060 --> 03:06.340]  while it was still frozen
[03:06.340 --> 03:08.620]  through a closed loop butane system.
[03:08.620 --> 03:10.580]  It says here, solvents butane.
[03:10.580 --> 03:13.120]  So this was ran with N-butane is what it was made with.
[03:13.120 --> 03:16.500]  So they ran it through probably an Emotech machine
[03:16.500 --> 03:18.740]  or something similar, an OB-DOS.
[03:18.740 --> 03:22.780]  Ran it through there with N-butane while it was frozen.
[03:22.780 --> 03:24.380]  Then it came out very,
[03:24.380 --> 03:26.020]  all of the terpenes were still intact.
[03:26.020 --> 03:26.860]  That's what I'm trying to say.
[03:26.860 --> 03:27.900]  It came out very terpy.
[03:27.900 --> 03:29.260]  All of the terps were still there.
[03:29.260 --> 03:30.580]  All of the flavor was still there.
[03:30.580 --> 03:32.580]  Why are they calling it live resin?
[03:32.580 --> 03:34.680]  Live resin is when the plants are cut down and frozen
[03:34.680 --> 03:35.700]  and we run them frozen.
[03:35.700 --> 03:36.700]  That's what live resin is.
[03:36.700 --> 03:38.300]  Why are they calling it live batter
[03:38.300 --> 03:39.660]  is what I should get to.
[03:39.660 --> 03:41.260]  It looks like cake batter, you guys.
[03:41.260 --> 03:43.580]  It's got the consistency of cake batter.
[03:43.580 --> 03:45.400]  It's not quite as runny as cake batter,
[03:45.400 --> 03:47.180]  but it's thick and battery.
[03:47.180 --> 03:51.600]  It's got a really interesting and unique consistency to it.
[03:51.600 --> 03:53.780]  A long time ago, we might not have approved of this.
[03:53.780 --> 03:55.640]  A long time ago, we might've said this looked bad,
[03:55.640 --> 03:58.380]  but the new tech makes it look delicious.
[03:58.380 --> 03:59.740]  So big shout out to everybody.
[03:59.740 --> 04:01.820]  I've just kissed their ass for a good solid minute and a half
[04:01.820 --> 04:03.560]  but I completely approve of this.
[04:03.560 --> 04:04.980]  I bred the lemon, Jeffrey.
[04:04.980 --> 04:06.820]  So when I saw that Apothecary had ran it
[04:06.820 --> 04:08.900]  and turned it into batter, I had to go get it.
[04:08.940 --> 04:09.780]  So big shout out.
[04:09.780 --> 04:10.940]  Everybody did a great job.
[04:10.940 --> 04:12.540]  I did a great job of smoking this, Graham.
[04:12.540 --> 04:13.360]  It was delicious.
[04:13.360 --> 04:14.700]  I'm glad I picked up several.
[04:14.700 --> 04:16.820]  Shout out, much love.
[04:16.820 --> 04:17.860]  I'm gonna move forward.
[04:17.860 --> 04:19.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been putting out old episodes
[04:19.860 --> 04:21.460]  of the podcast in chunks of three.
[04:21.460 --> 04:22.660]  That's right, I've got some OCD.
[04:22.660 --> 04:24.200]  My OCD comes in groups of three.
[04:24.200 --> 04:26.060]  So you're getting podcasts in groups of three.
[04:26.060 --> 04:27.980]  Also, they're about an hour long.
[04:27.980 --> 04:30.020]  So that three hour chunk is kind of
[04:30.020 --> 04:33.020]  what my recording software and where I post my podcasts,
[04:33.020 --> 04:35.340]  they don't really handle longer than a three hour episode.
[04:35.340 --> 04:38.500]  So you're getting three hour chunks of three episodes.
[04:39.140 --> 04:39.980]  I hope you're enjoying those.
[04:39.980 --> 04:40.820]  I put them out every Thursday.
[04:40.820 --> 04:42.780]  If you haven't caught on, go listen.
[04:42.780 --> 04:44.900]  Episodes one through nine are available now
[04:44.900 --> 04:46.160]  in three different chunks.
[04:46.160 --> 04:47.860]  So I've been doing a new episode on Monday,
[04:47.860 --> 04:50.560]  an old episode on Thursday, new episode on Monday,
[04:50.560 --> 04:51.560]  old episode on Thursday.
[04:51.560 --> 04:53.260]  I'm going to try to do that
[04:53.260 --> 04:55.620]  as long as my schedule will allow.
[04:55.620 --> 04:57.140]  Like I announced on a few episodes back,
[04:57.140 --> 04:58.960]  I am now the lead cultivator
[04:58.960 --> 05:01.060]  for Three Rivers Organics in Pueblo West.
[05:01.060 --> 05:03.080]  That keeps me completely busy.
[05:03.080 --> 05:04.760]  I also have the podcast.
[05:04.760 --> 05:06.420]  I have got my own garden.
[05:06.420 --> 05:07.820]  I'm a father.
[05:08.140 --> 05:08.980]  I'm a person.
[05:08.980 --> 05:09.820]  I've got a social life.
[05:09.820 --> 05:11.720]  Of course I need to eat and sleep and take care of myself.
[05:11.720 --> 05:12.660]  I got to take care of my health.
[05:12.660 --> 05:14.100]  I got to take care of my mind.
[05:14.100 --> 05:15.180]  So I do stay busy.
[05:15.180 --> 05:17.380]  I will try to get all of the episodes out to you.
[05:17.380 --> 05:18.860]  I have promised you YouTube videos.
[05:18.860 --> 05:20.340]  I am working on the YouTube videos.
[05:20.340 --> 05:22.940]  It takes a lot of work to make a damn YouTube video
[05:22.940 --> 05:24.180]  with iMovie.
[05:24.180 --> 05:25.540]  I'm getting them done.
[05:25.540 --> 05:26.380]  They will be up there.
[05:26.380 --> 05:27.420]  I'm going to put those up in chunks
[05:27.420 --> 05:29.900]  because like I said, you people are savages.
[05:29.900 --> 05:31.040]  And when I put out new content,
[05:31.040 --> 05:32.460]  you consume it immediately.
[05:32.460 --> 05:34.220]  And then you beg for more
[05:34.220 --> 05:35.580]  and want to have more for you lined up.
[05:35.580 --> 05:36.500]  I don't want to put out stuff
[05:36.500 --> 05:38.460]  and then not have anything ready
[05:38.460 --> 05:39.700]  for the people that are savages.
[05:39.700 --> 05:41.300]  So be patient with me.
[05:41.300 --> 05:43.340]  I will get that stuff out there.
[05:43.340 --> 05:44.220]  Next on the agenda,
[05:44.220 --> 05:46.140]  I want to talk about t-shirts and hoodies.
[05:46.140 --> 05:46.980]  That's right.
[05:46.980 --> 05:47.800]  I still have a few
[05:47.800 --> 05:49.460]  Grow From Your Heart podcast hoodies available.
[05:49.460 --> 05:50.620]  I've only got bigger sizes.
[05:50.620 --> 05:52.020]  I've got large, extra large,
[05:52.020 --> 05:53.420]  and possibly extra, extra large,
[05:53.420 --> 05:55.280]  and maybe even triple X.
[05:55.280 --> 05:56.460]  It depends on when you email me.
[05:56.460 --> 05:57.460]  If you're interested in one of those,
[05:57.460 --> 05:58.380]  send me an email.
[05:58.380 --> 05:59.740]  Growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[05:59.740 --> 06:01.600]  I'd love to put a hoodie on you.
[06:01.600 --> 06:02.560]  They are affordable.
[06:02.560 --> 06:03.920]  Shipping on them is kind of expensive
[06:03.920 --> 06:06.520]  because I ship them in one of those priority mailboxes.
[06:06.520 --> 06:07.560]  That is a little bit pricey,
[06:07.560 --> 06:08.400]  but it's well worth it.
[06:08.400 --> 06:09.220]  I will get you one.
[06:09.220 --> 06:11.040]  Also coming very soon, ladies and gentlemen,
[06:11.040 --> 06:13.400]  Grow From Your Heart podcast t-shirts.
[06:13.400 --> 06:15.360]  The hoodies, let me describe the hoodies.
[06:15.360 --> 06:17.900]  The hoodies have the Grow From Your Heart podcast logo
[06:17.900 --> 06:19.600]  on the left breast, and it is smaller.
[06:19.600 --> 06:20.960]  It does not have my face.
[06:20.960 --> 06:22.280]  It just has the EQ bar,
[06:22.280 --> 06:24.460]  and it says Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[06:24.460 --> 06:25.400]  On the back, however,
[06:25.400 --> 06:27.160]  it's got the logo quite large
[06:27.160 --> 06:28.440]  with my cheesy face on there,
[06:28.440 --> 06:30.480]  just like the logo you see on iTunes.
[06:30.480 --> 06:31.800]  That is on the hoodies.
[06:31.800 --> 06:32.880]  On the t-shirts,
[06:32.880 --> 06:35.480]  it says Grow From Your Heart on the front without my face.
[06:35.480 --> 06:37.460]  It's got the logo that does not have my face.
[06:37.460 --> 06:39.800]  I don't like wearing a shirt with my face on it.
[06:39.800 --> 06:40.640]  I wanna be able to wear
[06:40.640 --> 06:42.040]  a Grow From Your Heart podcast t-shirt.
[06:42.040 --> 06:43.760]  So on the front, it's got the logo,
[06:43.760 --> 06:45.760]  does not have my face, nice and bright.
[06:45.760 --> 06:47.640]  It's got the EQ bars that are red, gold, and green
[06:47.640 --> 06:49.660]  so I can keep the Rasta colors in there.
[06:49.660 --> 06:52.200]  All the Grow From Your Heart podcast logo is Rasta colored.
[06:52.200 --> 06:53.500]  It's red, yellow, and green.
[06:53.500 --> 06:55.100]  Then on the back, you guys,
[06:55.100 --> 06:57.680]  on the back, centered on the back across the shoulders,
[06:57.680 --> 07:01.220]  it says take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[07:01.260 --> 07:02.940]  So those t-shirts will be here.
[07:02.940 --> 07:05.120]  Hopefully, by the time this episode comes out,
[07:05.120 --> 07:06.820]  hopefully those t-shirts will arrive.
[07:06.820 --> 07:08.180]  Shout out to our friends at Handmade Apparel
[07:08.180 --> 07:09.660]  for making me more t-shirts.
[07:09.660 --> 07:10.580]  They're very affordable.
[07:10.580 --> 07:12.700]  If you're interested in a t-shirt or a hoodie,
[07:12.700 --> 07:13.580]  please send me an email.
[07:13.580 --> 07:16.580]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[07:16.580 --> 07:18.300]  Big shout out to my friend Kelvin Medina.
[07:18.300 --> 07:20.300]  As soon as I told him I had t-shirts available,
[07:20.300 --> 07:23.980]  he placed an order for two for himself and one for his son.
[07:23.980 --> 07:26.300]  Much love, much respect, I appreciate that.
[07:26.300 --> 07:27.340]  I love the support.
[07:27.340 --> 07:28.940]  All right, t-shirts are coming, hoodies are here.
[07:28.940 --> 07:29.900]  If you want one, email me,
[07:29.900 --> 07:32.020]  growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[07:32.020 --> 07:34.660]  Next on my agenda, before we get to the main topic,
[07:34.660 --> 07:37.240]  let me tease the main topic before I keep boring you.
[07:37.240 --> 07:38.980]  Let me get your attention to make sure you keep listening.
[07:38.980 --> 07:40.380]  That's how you're supposed to do it, right?
[07:40.380 --> 07:42.540]  This is going to be episode number three
[07:42.540 --> 07:46.160]  of the Common Garden Pests and Issues, part three.
[07:46.160 --> 07:48.220]  This episode, we're going to talk about thrips.
[07:48.220 --> 07:50.580]  That's what we're gonna talk about is the garden issue.
[07:50.580 --> 07:53.020]  Thrips come, seems like if you buy soil,
[07:53.020 --> 07:55.820]  you get thrips for free in most soil these days.
[07:55.820 --> 07:57.980]  So we're gonna talk about how to take care of that.
[07:57.980 --> 08:00.220]  But let me keep moving on with the pre-show stuff
[08:00.220 --> 08:01.060]  that I like to cover,
[08:01.060 --> 08:04.300]  and then we will get into the handling thrips talk.
[08:04.300 --> 08:05.140]  Where was I?
[08:05.140 --> 08:06.900]  Patreon, that's right, Patreon.
[08:06.900 --> 08:08.900]  I talk about Patreon quite often.
[08:08.900 --> 08:10.620]  I ignored Patreon for a couple episodes
[08:10.620 --> 08:12.380]  so that people didn't get sick of it.
[08:12.380 --> 08:13.620]  Let me tell you what Patreon is.
[08:13.620 --> 08:16.340]  Patreon is a service that allows you as a listener
[08:16.340 --> 08:18.300]  to contribute to the podcast financially.
[08:18.300 --> 08:20.160]  If you feel like this podcast was worth a dollar
[08:20.160 --> 08:22.580]  of your time, you can go to patreon.com
[08:22.580 --> 08:24.580]  slash growfromyourheart, and you can sign up
[08:24.580 --> 08:27.280]  to contribute to the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[08:27.280 --> 08:29.520]  I'm not trying to get rich off podcasting, you guys.
[08:29.520 --> 08:31.160]  I podcast because I love it.
[08:31.160 --> 08:33.040]  I podcast because I can't shut up.
[08:33.040 --> 08:35.360]  I podcast because I love cannabis,
[08:35.360 --> 08:37.360]  and I can't shut up about cannabis.
[08:37.360 --> 08:39.680]  I was sitting at the table with Maddie and Spence
[08:39.680 --> 08:41.520]  and a bunch of the crew a long time ago,
[08:41.520 --> 08:43.600]  and people would ask me questions about growing,
[08:43.600 --> 08:45.080]  and I caught myself repeating myself,
[08:45.080 --> 08:47.160]  saying the same shit over and over to people.
[08:47.160 --> 08:48.680]  And I thought, I should just record this,
[08:48.680 --> 08:50.420]  so when somebody asks me this question,
[08:50.420 --> 08:53.320]  I can tell them, hey, go listen to number 74 of my podcast
[08:53.320 --> 08:54.600]  and you can learn this.
[08:54.600 --> 08:56.240]  And I just love talking about cannabis,
[08:56.240 --> 08:58.600]  and I love podcasting, I love communicating with people,
[08:58.600 --> 09:00.480]  I want everyone to grow good weed,
[09:00.480 --> 09:02.540]  so that's why I do the podcast.
[09:02.540 --> 09:04.560]  The reason I'm asking for financial support
[09:04.560 --> 09:06.480]  is because it does cost me money, you guys.
[09:06.480 --> 09:08.040]  The equipment costs money to upkeep.
[09:08.040 --> 09:10.160]  I'm always having an equipment failure.
[09:10.160 --> 09:11.360]  Something always fucking breaks.
[09:11.360 --> 09:13.360]  Technology always breaks down on you.
[09:13.360 --> 09:14.240]  It's kind of a bitch.
[09:14.240 --> 09:17.800]  Also, my website, iRegeneticsColorado.com
[09:17.800 --> 09:19.400]  is where I host the podcast.
[09:19.400 --> 09:21.200]  It does cost a little bit of money.
[09:21.200 --> 09:23.240]  Since I'm putting up one episode on Monday
[09:23.240 --> 09:26.200]  and another three-hour episode on Thursday,
[09:26.200 --> 09:27.600]  I'm using up a lot of bandwidth,
[09:27.600 --> 09:30.040]  so I'm paying for a large service package.
[09:30.040 --> 09:31.160]  It costs me a little bit of money
[09:31.160 --> 09:32.900]  to keep that website up every year,
[09:32.900 --> 09:36.380]  so I'm just asking for help to offset the cost of that.
[09:36.380 --> 09:38.880]  I will pay for it out of my pocket if I need to.
[09:38.880 --> 09:40.680]  This is one of my favorite things to do.
[09:40.680 --> 09:43.160]  I love doing it, but if you guys would like to help,
[09:43.160 --> 09:44.160]  I would appreciate it.
[09:44.160 --> 09:45.240]  I'm not begging, I'm just saying,
[09:45.240 --> 09:46.280]  hey, I could use a hand.
[09:46.280 --> 09:47.520]  I'm doing you a favor.
[09:47.520 --> 09:49.040]  It'd be cool if you did me a favor.
[09:49.040 --> 09:51.320]  And if you can't help me out, I still love you.
[09:51.320 --> 09:53.320]  I love you just for listening to the podcast
[09:53.320 --> 09:54.160]  and being there.
[09:54.160 --> 09:55.000]  Thank you.
[09:55.000 --> 09:55.980]  I love you for supporting cannabis.
[09:55.980 --> 09:58.320]  I love you for wanting to know more about cannabis.
[09:58.320 --> 09:59.860]  Don't feel like you need to give me something
[09:59.860 --> 10:01.180]  for me to like you.
[10:01.180 --> 10:02.880]  I like you just for being there, so thanks.
[10:02.880 --> 10:04.040]  Some folks can contribute.
[10:04.040 --> 10:05.440]  Some folks contacted me and they're like,
[10:05.440 --> 10:06.640]  hey man, you helped me out a lot.
[10:06.640 --> 10:08.220]  What can I do for you?
[10:08.220 --> 10:10.320]  Folks like that, Patreon is there for them,
[10:10.320 --> 10:11.160]  if you want to.
[10:11.160 --> 10:12.000]  I'm not begging.
[10:12.000 --> 10:13.920]  All right, so now I wanna move on
[10:13.920 --> 10:15.760]  to reading a couple of iTunes comments.
[10:15.760 --> 10:17.760]  I haven't read iTunes comments in a couple of episodes,
[10:17.760 --> 10:19.520]  and I've got two great new comments.
[10:19.520 --> 10:21.280]  I'm gonna take a big deep breath and slow down,
[10:22.120 --> 10:22.960]  because I feel like I'm talking really fast.
[10:22.960 --> 10:23.780]  So here we go.
[10:25.560 --> 10:27.200]  All right, sometimes you just gotta calm the fuck down,
[10:27.200 --> 10:28.920]  right, and get zen.
[10:28.920 --> 10:30.520]  Not even gonna edit that moment out.
[10:30.520 --> 10:31.960]  So this first comment that I wanna read
[10:31.960 --> 10:34.720]  comes from a person who calls themselves Will Grow Freely.
[10:34.720 --> 10:37.440]  They left the comment on February 27th.
[10:37.440 --> 10:39.480]  Their comment was titled, Touch of Green.
[10:39.480 --> 10:41.000]  Of course, they gave me five stars,
[10:41.000 --> 10:41.900]  and it goes like this.
[10:41.900 --> 10:43.040]  This is an awesome show.
[10:43.040 --> 10:45.520]  I look forward to new episodes coming out every Monday.
[10:45.520 --> 10:46.840]  Jeff puts a lot of time and energy
[10:46.840 --> 10:49.360]  into making every episode, and it shows.
[10:49.360 --> 10:51.000]  As someone from a prohibition state,
[10:51.720 --> 10:53.280]  it's great to hear about growing and cannabis culture
[10:53.280 --> 10:54.920]  so that I can keep tabs on what's happening
[10:54.920 --> 10:56.520]  in the free world.
[10:56.520 --> 10:58.240]  White Mike rules as well.
[10:58.240 --> 10:59.080]  You hear that, Mike?
[10:59.080 --> 11:00.440]  You just got a shout out, bro.
[11:00.440 --> 11:02.640]  White Mike rules as well.
[11:02.640 --> 11:06.200]  Best cannabis podcast out there by far.
[11:06.200 --> 11:08.420]  Hey, Will Grow Freely, I appreciate that.
[11:08.420 --> 11:09.320]  Several people have told me
[11:09.320 --> 11:11.320]  I'm the best cannabis podcast out there.
[11:11.320 --> 11:13.000]  I'm not in any competition,
[11:13.000 --> 11:14.960]  but I completely appreciate hearing that,
[11:14.960 --> 11:17.720]  because some of my heroes have podcasts about cannabis.
[11:17.720 --> 11:19.440]  So knowing that my heroes, you're telling me
[11:19.440 --> 11:20.880]  that you like me more than the people
[11:21.720 --> 11:23.080]  that have inspired me, that means a lot to me,
[11:23.080 --> 11:25.200]  although I don't find competition in there.
[11:25.200 --> 11:26.560]  Support all the cannabis podcasts.
[11:26.560 --> 11:28.160]  You'll learn something different from everybody.
[11:28.160 --> 11:29.800]  That's why I listen to their podcasts.
[11:29.800 --> 11:32.200]  I try not to listen to too much of the other podcasts.
[11:32.200 --> 11:33.820]  I can listen to Bo Nellis,
[11:33.820 --> 11:36.900]  because she doesn't contaminate my thought process.
[11:36.900 --> 11:38.360]  But if I listen to the Dude Grows
[11:38.360 --> 11:40.080]  and the Adam Dunn Show too much,
[11:40.080 --> 11:42.340]  I feel like they kinda contaminate my podcast.
[11:42.340 --> 11:44.360]  I end up doing their show.
[11:44.360 --> 11:46.920]  It's like if a musician, if I'm a drummer,
[11:46.920 --> 11:48.840]  I feel like if I listen to Led Zeppelin all day,
[11:48.840 --> 11:51.240]  and then I play my drums, I sound like Led Zeppelin.
[11:51.240 --> 11:53.880]  So I don't listen to the Dude Grows too frequently.
[11:53.880 --> 11:54.720]  I do listen.
[11:54.720 --> 11:56.000]  Of course I listen to the Dude Grows Show,
[11:56.000 --> 11:57.760]  but I can't listen religiously,
[11:57.760 --> 11:59.800]  because I start talking like Scotty,
[11:59.800 --> 12:01.640]  and I start talking like the dude.
[12:01.640 --> 12:04.240]  So I can't listen to too many of the cannabis podcasts,
[12:04.240 --> 12:05.080]  but I do listen to them.
[12:05.080 --> 12:07.040]  And if I listen to the Adam Dunn Podcast,
[12:07.040 --> 12:09.960]  I get too sucked into the topic that they're talking about,
[12:09.960 --> 12:10.800]  and I wanna research it,
[12:10.800 --> 12:11.760]  and then I wanna do it on my show,
[12:11.760 --> 12:12.920]  and I feel like I'm just ripping them off,
[12:12.920 --> 12:13.740]  and that's not fair.
[12:13.740 --> 12:15.440]  So I do listen, I just can't,
[12:15.440 --> 12:17.200]  because I feel like if I listen
[12:17.200 --> 12:18.340]  to the same comedians all the time,
[12:18.760 --> 12:19.600]  I start telling their jokes.
[12:19.600 --> 12:20.620]  I don't wanna do that to the podcast.
[12:20.620 --> 12:22.500]  I wanna keep it mine.
[12:22.500 --> 12:23.840]  How the hell did I get way out there?
[12:23.840 --> 12:25.600]  Oh, I was talking about being the best podcast.
[12:25.600 --> 12:26.440]  Yeah, I listen to them all.
[12:26.440 --> 12:28.020]  I don't want the competition, but thank you.
[12:28.020 --> 12:28.860]  That's really cool.
[12:28.860 --> 12:30.620]  Wilgo Freely, thank you for the five-star comment.
[12:30.620 --> 12:32.280]  I completely appreciate that.
[12:32.280 --> 12:35.940]  I'm glad that you are appreciating the culture part.
[12:35.940 --> 12:38.220]  It feels like you're here with me is what I'm trying to do.
[12:38.220 --> 12:39.860]  I want you to know that we're dabbing.
[12:39.860 --> 12:40.860]  I want you to know what we're doing.
[12:40.860 --> 12:42.860]  I want you to know about the events we're going to.
[12:42.860 --> 12:45.100]  I want you to know about the equipment we're using.
[12:45.100 --> 12:46.400]  So what I'm trying to do is keep you in the loop.
[12:46.400 --> 12:49.880]  So thanks for noticing and super thanks for the comment.
[12:49.880 --> 12:51.520]  The next comment comes from somebody
[12:51.520 --> 12:55.040]  who calls themselves KCCB68.
[12:55.040 --> 12:57.200]  The title of their comment was, sets the standard.
[12:57.200 --> 12:58.880]  They left the comment on February 27th.
[12:58.880 --> 13:01.960]  And of course they gave me another five-star rating.
[13:01.960 --> 13:04.280]  The comment is short and simple and it goes like this.
[13:04.280 --> 13:06.600]  Jeff has an elite knowledge of cannabis horticulture
[13:06.600 --> 13:08.840]  and doesn't push brands.
[13:08.840 --> 13:10.640]  I'm glad that you noticed that.
[13:10.640 --> 13:12.720]  There was another podcast that kind of inspired me
[13:12.720 --> 13:14.120]  to do a show.
[13:14.120 --> 13:16.680]  Every time somebody would say, hey, I've got a problem,
[13:16.680 --> 13:18.800]  they would say, go buy this product
[13:18.800 --> 13:21.400]  and spray it all over your plants, problem solved.
[13:21.400 --> 13:24.120]  And I feel like that was not a real solution.
[13:24.120 --> 13:25.960]  Yeah, that's a band-aid.
[13:25.960 --> 13:27.700]  You've got spider mites, spray fluoromite.
[13:27.700 --> 13:30.680]  You don't have spider mites anymore for about 45 days.
[13:30.680 --> 13:32.640]  But in 45 days, you're going to get spider mites again
[13:32.640 --> 13:34.720]  because you did not correct the issue.
[13:34.720 --> 13:35.920]  I don't push brands.
[13:35.920 --> 13:37.240]  I push solutions.
[13:37.240 --> 13:38.440]  I push logic.
[13:38.440 --> 13:39.360]  I push passion.
[13:39.360 --> 13:41.080]  So thank you for noticing that.
[13:41.080 --> 13:43.920]  An elite knowledge of cannabis horticulture.
[13:44.680 --> 13:45.520]  Can I use that in my resume?
[13:45.520 --> 13:46.600]  That sounds fucking good, dude.
[13:46.600 --> 13:48.280]  Thank you, dude, dudette.
[13:48.280 --> 13:52.640]  KCCB68 is very, that's open.
[13:52.640 --> 13:53.480]  That could be open gender.
[13:53.480 --> 13:56.240]  So I appreciate that comment, dude, and or dudette.
[13:56.240 --> 13:58.000]  You could be both nowadays, I guess, right?
[13:58.000 --> 13:59.400]  I hope I didn't just embarrass you saying that.
[13:59.400 --> 14:00.240]  That's awkward.
[14:00.240 --> 14:02.080]  But anyway, thank you for the great comment.
[14:02.080 --> 14:03.440]  I'm going to use that in my resume.
[14:03.440 --> 14:05.680]  An elite knowledge of cannabis horticulture.
[14:05.680 --> 14:06.600]  And I do not push brands.
[14:06.600 --> 14:07.760]  I try not to.
[14:07.760 --> 14:09.080]  I've been approached by brands
[14:09.080 --> 14:10.560]  that want me to advertise on the show.
[14:10.560 --> 14:12.280]  And I try not to do it
[14:12.320 --> 14:14.720]  because I don't want it to affect my advice.
[14:14.720 --> 14:16.440]  So you guys, thank you for the comments.
[14:16.440 --> 14:18.160]  If anybody wants to leave an iTunes comment,
[14:18.160 --> 14:19.320]  I would truly appreciate it.
[14:19.320 --> 14:20.720]  All you have to do is go to iTunes,
[14:20.720 --> 14:22.200]  go to the iTunes store,
[14:22.200 --> 14:24.040]  search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[14:24.040 --> 14:25.240]  scroll down to the bottom,
[14:25.240 --> 14:26.880]  click on the Grow From Your Heart podcast logo.
[14:26.880 --> 14:28.560]  Then there's a little section.
[14:28.560 --> 14:30.040]  It says ratings and reviews.
[14:30.920 --> 14:32.280]  You'll find where to write a review.
[14:32.280 --> 14:34.400]  You'll also find where to put in some stars.
[14:34.400 --> 14:37.240]  So far, everybody has given me a five-star rating.
[14:37.240 --> 14:39.480]  I encourage you to click on the amount of stars
[14:39.480 --> 14:41.360]  you feel I truly deserve.
[14:41.360 --> 14:42.200]  I would appreciate it.
[14:43.040 --> 14:45.520]  And I will also read your comment on a future episode.
[14:45.520 --> 14:47.320]  I'm sure you guys can hear the dryness in my voice.
[14:47.320 --> 14:48.840]  So I'm gonna press pause for a second,
[14:48.840 --> 14:50.320]  take a quick drink, and I'll be right back.
[14:50.320 --> 14:53.280]  We will get to the point of this podcast.
[14:53.280 --> 14:55.520]  All right, podcast world, I took a couple more dabs
[14:55.520 --> 14:56.600]  and I took a couple of drinks
[14:56.600 --> 14:59.720]  and I am ready to talk about our next garden issue.
[14:59.720 --> 15:03.640]  Let's talk about thrips and how to identify, eradicate
[15:03.640 --> 15:06.520]  and prevent getting thrips in your cannabis garden.
[15:06.520 --> 15:07.960]  Let's talk a little bit about thrips
[15:07.960 --> 15:09.920]  before we talk about getting rid of them.
[15:09.920 --> 15:12.180]  Thrips are ugly motherfuckers, you guys.
[15:13.020 --> 15:14.500]  Thrips are barely visible to the naked eye.
[15:14.500 --> 15:15.760]  They're super tiny.
[15:15.760 --> 15:16.980]  You need a microscope to see them.
[15:16.980 --> 15:18.880]  You need a magnifying glass to see them.
[15:18.880 --> 15:20.260]  You will probably never see them,
[15:20.260 --> 15:22.980]  but you will see the damage that they leave in your garden.
[15:22.980 --> 15:25.240]  You'll see their honeydew, you'll see their poop,
[15:25.240 --> 15:26.140]  you'll see their effects.
[15:26.140 --> 15:27.260]  So let's talk about the adults.
[15:27.260 --> 15:28.940]  Adults have wings, but they don't fly.
[15:28.940 --> 15:31.300]  What kind of bullshit bug is that?
[15:31.300 --> 15:32.420]  It's got wings and doesn't fly.
[15:32.420 --> 15:34.540]  So if you see a bug with wings that doesn't fly
[15:34.540 --> 15:35.560]  and you're magnifying glass,
[15:35.560 --> 15:38.220]  it is probably, possibly a thrip.
[15:38.220 --> 15:39.540]  Sometimes they jump.
[15:39.540 --> 15:40.740]  I've read that thrips jump.
[15:40.740 --> 15:41.980]  I've never seen this personally
[15:42.740 --> 15:45.340]  because they're so small, I've never seen it happen.
[15:45.340 --> 15:49.740]  Thrips have yellow or brown heads and bodies.
[15:49.740 --> 15:50.580]  They are yellowish brown.
[15:50.580 --> 15:52.440]  They look, they're just ugly.
[15:52.440 --> 15:54.220]  There's ugly little nasty little bugs.
[15:54.220 --> 15:56.160]  They attack the leaves and they're often found
[15:56.160 --> 15:58.420]  on the surface of your leaves.
[15:58.420 --> 16:00.140]  Honestly, you guys, the number one way
[16:00.140 --> 16:03.180]  that I think I have gotten thrips is by purchasing soil.
[16:03.180 --> 16:05.520]  I can't blame any specific brand of soil
[16:05.520 --> 16:07.460]  because it's happened with more than one brand.
[16:07.460 --> 16:11.300]  What happens with soil is it's made by a certain vendor.
[16:11.300 --> 16:14.380]  You're buying soil brand A, soil brand B.
[16:14.380 --> 16:16.180]  They're made by a vendor in a certain warehouse
[16:16.180 --> 16:17.080]  in a certain location.
[16:17.080 --> 16:19.300]  Maybe one's made in Colorado, one's made in Michigan,
[16:19.300 --> 16:21.020]  one's made in California.
[16:21.020 --> 16:22.300]  But eventually they all end up
[16:22.300 --> 16:23.580]  in a shipping warehouse together.
[16:23.580 --> 16:25.420]  They all get stacked together.
[16:25.420 --> 16:27.520]  One of those packages had bugs
[16:27.520 --> 16:29.180]  and just like any other community,
[16:29.180 --> 16:31.180]  the bugs spread throughout all the dirt
[16:31.180 --> 16:33.700]  and now those packs of dirt get put on a pallet.
[16:33.700 --> 16:36.500]  They get shipped to your local hydro shop and you buy them
[16:36.500 --> 16:39.460]  and now you've got free thrips with your dirt.
[16:39.900 --> 16:42.420]  It's a good idea to treat for thrips right away.
[16:42.420 --> 16:44.020]  I like to, when I transplant,
[16:44.020 --> 16:48.320]  I like to soak, root drench all of my new transplants
[16:48.320 --> 16:52.160]  with evergreen pyrethrum spray or a pyrethrum drench.
[16:52.160 --> 16:55.220]  I use 15 milliliters per gallon of evergreen.
[16:55.220 --> 16:57.060]  That's evergreen pyganic.
[16:57.060 --> 16:58.180]  Mix that in with your water.
[16:58.180 --> 16:59.600]  You can put it in with your nutrients.
[16:59.600 --> 17:01.760]  You can pH it and then just soak your plants with it.
[17:01.760 --> 17:04.900]  Soak the water, soak the soil is what I'm trying to say
[17:04.900 --> 17:08.380]  and that will get rid of most of your soil bound pests.
[17:08.380 --> 17:10.100]  I would almost recommend doing that again
[17:10.100 --> 17:11.620]  in about five days and that'll,
[17:11.620 --> 17:14.580]  if they laid eggs in there, that will kill their eggs also.
[17:14.580 --> 17:15.740]  That will really help you out.
[17:15.740 --> 17:18.340]  If you're gonna go organics, use some neem cakes,
[17:18.340 --> 17:21.060]  some caranja meal, some neem meal in the soil.
[17:21.060 --> 17:22.860]  That will really help get rid of them in the soil.
[17:22.860 --> 17:24.900]  But I feel like a lot of the thrips,
[17:24.900 --> 17:26.500]  you buy them free with your dirt.
[17:26.500 --> 17:27.340]  They're like a bonus.
[17:27.340 --> 17:28.980]  They're like a prize in your cereal.
[17:28.980 --> 17:30.220]  A lot of bugs come that way.
[17:30.220 --> 17:32.960]  So it's a good idea to treat before you even see problems
[17:32.960 --> 17:34.660]  with thrips in a lot of soil,
[17:34.660 --> 17:36.180]  especially now in the springtime
[17:36.180 --> 17:37.940]  and in the summertime when it gets warmer,
[17:38.460 --> 17:39.300]  you will get a lot more bugs.
[17:39.300 --> 17:40.460]  When it's cold, they die off.
[17:40.460 --> 17:42.220]  They're in the dirt, they're being hauled across the country
[17:42.220 --> 17:44.900]  in the soil, they're in the back of a hydro shop
[17:44.900 --> 17:47.420]  in the cold, they're gonna get cold.
[17:47.420 --> 17:48.800]  They're not gonna live through that,
[17:48.800 --> 17:51.100]  but the eggs may, so you need to treat.
[17:51.100 --> 17:53.900]  All right, so you will find them attacking the leaves
[17:53.900 --> 17:54.860]  and the leaf surfaces.
[17:54.860 --> 17:56.980]  They get up there and they chew on the leaf surface.
[17:56.980 --> 17:58.240]  They penetrate the leaf surface
[17:58.240 --> 18:00.320]  and they suck out the sap and juices, you guys.
[18:00.320 --> 18:01.900]  That's what most of these plant insects do.
[18:01.900 --> 18:04.100]  They get in there and suck out the life juice
[18:04.100 --> 18:04.940]  from your plant.
[18:04.940 --> 18:06.020]  They dehydrate your plant.
[18:06.020 --> 18:07.140]  They suck out all the nutrients.
[18:07.140 --> 18:08.620]  They suck out all the nourishment.
[18:08.620 --> 18:11.480]  This slows down the growth of most of your plants.
[18:11.480 --> 18:12.700]  This slows down the vigor.
[18:12.700 --> 18:14.620]  This will certainly slow down
[18:14.620 --> 18:16.500]  and decrease the yield of your plants.
[18:16.500 --> 18:19.260]  This will mess with the amount of resin in your plants.
[18:19.260 --> 18:20.460]  This will mess with the flavor.
[18:20.460 --> 18:21.900]  How does it mess with flavor?
[18:21.900 --> 18:24.820]  The plants will trigger different terpenoids
[18:24.820 --> 18:25.820]  and different cannabinoids
[18:25.820 --> 18:27.860]  because they're under a stress response.
[18:27.860 --> 18:28.940]  Things will be different.
[18:28.940 --> 18:30.940]  You will see problems that you didn't see before
[18:30.940 --> 18:33.380]  because they're dealing with stresses.
[18:33.380 --> 18:35.900]  So thrips will leave like a white silver mark
[18:35.900 --> 18:37.180]  or patches on your leaves.
[18:37.180 --> 18:39.060]  We call this honeydew.
[18:39.060 --> 18:40.140]  It's their shit.
[18:40.140 --> 18:41.420]  They're biting into your leaves.
[18:41.420 --> 18:42.580]  They're sucking out the juice
[18:42.580 --> 18:45.020]  and then they're leaving these little snail trails,
[18:45.020 --> 18:47.000]  this little glistening, glittery,
[18:47.000 --> 18:48.740]  they call it a honeydew trail.
[18:48.740 --> 18:49.580]  That's their shit.
[18:49.580 --> 18:50.500]  That's their secretions.
[18:50.500 --> 18:51.940]  They're pooping all over your plants
[18:51.940 --> 18:54.920]  and I find it to be completely disgusting.
[18:54.920 --> 18:56.020]  So you don't want thrips in there.
[18:56.020 --> 18:57.580]  They'll make your leaves look kind of scabbed.
[18:57.580 --> 18:59.660]  They'll make it look like your leaves just got beat up.
[18:59.660 --> 19:01.100]  They'll make everything ugly.
[19:01.100 --> 19:02.220]  It looks like something's been in there
[19:02.220 --> 19:04.400]  chewing on the garden because it has.
[19:04.400 --> 19:06.040]  It is thrips.
[19:06.040 --> 19:10.360]  Sometimes you will see green or black specks
[19:10.360 --> 19:11.680]  on the bottom sides of the leaves.
[19:11.680 --> 19:14.160]  Quite often near the veins of the leaves.
[19:14.160 --> 19:16.400]  You got the main vein that runs down the center of the leaf.
[19:16.400 --> 19:18.360]  Then you got the little veins that branch out.
[19:18.360 --> 19:21.320]  You will find specks of green chunk or brown chunk
[19:21.320 --> 19:23.800]  or black chunks underneath there.
[19:23.800 --> 19:25.200]  Guess what that is, you guys?
[19:25.200 --> 19:28.400]  That is thrip shit on your leaves.
[19:28.400 --> 19:29.640]  You're gonna make hash out of that
[19:29.640 --> 19:30.920]  and you're gonna smoke thrip shit
[19:30.920 --> 19:33.600]  and it's gonna be disgusting.
[19:33.600 --> 19:35.040]  Get rid of the thrips, you guys.
[19:35.040 --> 19:36.240]  There's several ways to get rid of them.
[19:36.240 --> 19:37.200]  We're gonna talk about that here
[19:37.200 --> 19:38.880]  in just a couple of seconds.
[19:38.880 --> 19:41.900]  Nobody wants to smoke thrips or thrip shit
[19:41.900 --> 19:43.240]  or thrip honeydew.
[19:43.240 --> 19:44.080]  That is gross.
[19:44.080 --> 19:45.900]  Let's get rid of these bugs.
[19:45.900 --> 19:48.320]  Sometimes the damage looks a lot like spider mites
[19:48.320 --> 19:51.340]  but it gets a lot worse a lot more quickly.
[19:51.340 --> 19:53.760]  Thrips can do a lot more damage than a spider mite.
[19:53.760 --> 19:56.440]  Russet mites are probably more dangerous than thrips
[19:56.440 --> 19:58.920]  but thrips can really destroy things quickly.
[19:58.920 --> 20:00.280]  Thrips can kill gardens.
[20:00.280 --> 20:02.340]  Commercial gardens have been shut down
[20:02.380 --> 20:04.420]  and started over because of thrips.
[20:04.420 --> 20:06.820]  So if you see thrips, if you suspect thrips,
[20:06.820 --> 20:07.660]  you need to get in there
[20:07.660 --> 20:10.560]  and you need to take care of it very quickly.
[20:10.560 --> 20:13.320]  How can you prevent thrips?
[20:13.320 --> 20:15.340]  Just like most of the other issues I've talked about,
[20:15.340 --> 20:18.600]  you can prevent thrips by having a clean, sealed environment.
[20:18.600 --> 20:20.000]  You need a clean grow room.
[20:20.000 --> 20:23.260]  Do not let your pets into the grow room.
[20:23.260 --> 20:25.700]  If you bring in new plants from another grower,
[20:25.700 --> 20:27.780]  if you bring in plants from a dispensary,
[20:27.780 --> 20:30.300]  treat those plants before they are introduced
[20:30.300 --> 20:31.780]  to your main grow.
[20:32.220 --> 20:33.420]  Have a quarantine area.
[20:33.420 --> 20:35.740]  If I give you a clone, do not trust me.
[20:35.740 --> 20:36.760]  I am a good grower.
[20:36.760 --> 20:37.900]  I am reputable.
[20:37.900 --> 20:39.820]  You don't know where I got clones from.
[20:39.820 --> 20:41.600]  You don't know who I've been cloning with.
[20:41.600 --> 20:43.340]  You don't know whose garden I've played in.
[20:43.340 --> 20:46.320]  You don't know whose dispensary grow I've been to.
[20:46.320 --> 20:47.780]  You don't know what grow store I went to
[20:47.780 --> 20:48.980]  and who I brushed up against.
[20:48.980 --> 20:51.500]  If I give you a clone, act like it's got bugs.
[20:51.500 --> 20:53.200]  Act like it has powdery mildew.
[20:53.200 --> 20:54.980]  Treat it accordingly and don't introduce it
[20:54.980 --> 20:57.540]  to general population until you are sure
[20:57.540 --> 21:00.060]  that it is bug free.
[21:00.060 --> 21:02.020]  So don't bring clones in.
[21:02.020 --> 21:03.740]  Don't bring plants in without treating them.
[21:03.740 --> 21:05.700]  Don't bring your pets into the garden.
[21:05.700 --> 21:07.740]  I've talked about how your pets carry bugs.
[21:07.740 --> 21:09.300]  Don't bring them in there.
[21:09.300 --> 21:11.240]  Treat your soil when you buy new soil.
[21:11.240 --> 21:13.180]  When you put plants into it, treat it right away.
[21:13.180 --> 21:14.700]  If those plants are vigorous enough,
[21:14.700 --> 21:16.540]  treat it with the evergreen, pyganics,
[21:16.540 --> 21:19.320]  and that will help you get rid of soil bound pests.
[21:19.320 --> 21:21.580]  Also, don't travel from garden to garden.
[21:21.580 --> 21:23.900]  If you're in another garden, take a shower,
[21:23.900 --> 21:26.780]  change your clothes, don't drag the pests around.
[21:26.780 --> 21:28.260]  Change your shoes.
[21:28.260 --> 21:30.900]  Don't wear the same shoes from one garden to another.
[21:30.900 --> 21:32.460]  If you are recycling soil,
[21:32.460 --> 21:34.620]  if you've got soil in a compost area,
[21:34.620 --> 21:36.020]  or if you've got soil outside,
[21:36.020 --> 21:37.620]  or if you've got soil in your garage,
[21:37.620 --> 21:41.680]  treat that soil as if it are contaminated with bugs.
[21:41.680 --> 21:42.860]  So get rid of the bugs.
[21:42.860 --> 21:44.400]  Make sure you don't bring the thrips in.
[21:44.400 --> 21:45.440]  They're a pain in the ass.
[21:45.440 --> 21:48.260]  All right, a prevention, another way to prevent thrips
[21:48.260 --> 21:50.300]  are the yellow and blue sticky cards.
[21:50.300 --> 21:51.780]  Put the yellow ones up kind of higher
[21:51.780 --> 21:53.700]  and the blue ones a little bit lower.
[21:53.700 --> 21:55.320]  They will certainly help you out.
[21:55.320 --> 21:56.660]  Those are mostly going to let you know
[21:56.660 --> 21:59.300]  that thrips are there and that you need to treat harder
[21:59.300 --> 22:01.540]  or start stepping up your pesticide
[22:01.540 --> 22:05.220]  or your beneficial insect program,
[22:05.220 --> 22:07.340]  your IPM program needs to be stepped up.
[22:07.340 --> 22:08.220]  So use the cards.
[22:08.220 --> 22:10.740]  They will let you know if you've got insects showing up.
[22:10.740 --> 22:12.220]  They are not going to catch
[22:12.220 --> 22:13.620]  the large amount of the population.
[22:13.620 --> 22:15.720]  They're going to catch the few that fly to the cards,
[22:15.720 --> 22:17.160]  that travel to the cards.
[22:17.160 --> 22:18.900]  When you see those, that lets you know
[22:18.900 --> 22:21.740]  there are a lot more there that you need to treat.
[22:21.740 --> 22:24.620]  All right, so the cards are a great start.
[22:24.620 --> 22:26.460]  Another thing you can do if you see the bugs
[22:27.220 --> 22:28.060]  or you can do it as a preventative,
[22:28.060 --> 22:30.980]  you can use diatomaceous earth on the top of your soil.
[22:30.980 --> 22:33.780]  This only works of course, if you were using soil plants.
[22:33.780 --> 22:36.540]  If you're growing in hydro, this is not an option for you.
[22:36.540 --> 22:40.180]  If you're using soil or cocoa or soilless mix,
[22:40.180 --> 22:42.140]  take the top of the pot, let it dry.
[22:42.140 --> 22:44.540]  This is something that Sean taught us.
[22:44.540 --> 22:46.260]  Shout out to Sean, King Cola, what's up dude?
[22:46.260 --> 22:47.140]  Also shout out to Kelly.
[22:47.140 --> 22:48.260]  I saw Kelly the other day.
[22:48.260 --> 22:50.260]  I was working, I didn't have time to stop and say what's up.
[22:50.260 --> 22:51.340]  She saw me, she was working.
[22:51.340 --> 22:52.540]  She didn't have time to stop and say what's up,
[22:52.540 --> 22:53.380]  but we waved.
[22:53.380 --> 22:54.200]  What's up Kelly?
[22:54.200 --> 22:55.040]  Hope you're doing well.
[22:55.040 --> 22:57.320]  Shout out to Kelly Kelly and King Cola, Ross Cola.
[22:57.320 --> 22:58.200]  Hope you guys are doing well.
[22:58.200 --> 23:00.160]  Keep it organic you guys.
[23:00.160 --> 23:01.800]  So diatomaceous earth.
[23:01.800 --> 23:04.360]  When the soil dries, sprinkle a layer,
[23:04.360 --> 23:06.760]  like just a thin layer of diatomaceous earth
[23:06.760 --> 23:09.000]  across the entire top of the soil surface.
[23:09.000 --> 23:10.480]  You wanna cover it all.
[23:10.480 --> 23:12.620]  Now diatomaceous earth is really coarse.
[23:12.620 --> 23:13.900]  It's kind of sharp.
[23:13.900 --> 23:15.560]  If you were a soft bodied insect,
[23:15.560 --> 23:16.960]  you don't wanna climb through that shit
[23:16.960 --> 23:18.560]  because it's gonna claw you up.
[23:18.560 --> 23:20.000]  It's like trying to watch a human climb
[23:20.000 --> 23:22.120]  through a bunch of lava rocks while naked.
[23:22.120 --> 23:23.320]  You're just gonna get cut to shit.
[23:23.320 --> 23:24.840]  It's not gonna be any fun.
[23:25.720 --> 23:28.160]  The bugs don't wanna climb through the diatomaceous earth.
[23:28.160 --> 23:29.060]  They don't wanna get in there.
[23:29.060 --> 23:30.520]  The thrips don't wanna climb down in there.
[23:30.520 --> 23:31.600]  They don't wanna go into the soil.
[23:31.600 --> 23:32.720]  They don't wanna climb out.
[23:32.720 --> 23:33.560]  They will die.
[23:33.560 --> 23:35.280]  Diatomaceous earth is very effective
[23:35.280 --> 23:38.000]  on a lot of insects that travel through your soil
[23:38.000 --> 23:39.600]  that wanna go from the leaves to the soil
[23:39.600 --> 23:41.840]  that try to make a little area,
[23:41.840 --> 23:44.680]  like a, what is it, a trade route is what I wanna call it.
[23:44.680 --> 23:46.960]  Diatomaceous earth is great for those types of bugs.
[23:46.960 --> 23:47.960]  Let the soil dry.
[23:47.960 --> 23:49.320]  Sprinkle it on there.
[23:49.320 --> 23:51.340]  Once your plants need water, yes you can water them,
[23:51.340 --> 23:52.860]  but it's most effective to put it on there
[23:52.860 --> 23:54.080]  while the plants are dry.
[23:54.080 --> 23:56.040]  Try to let it go for a little while.
[23:56.040 --> 23:57.760]  Another great way to get rid of thrips
[23:57.760 --> 23:59.340]  are beneficial nematodes.
[23:59.340 --> 24:01.880]  I've talked about beneficial nematodes a lot.
[24:01.880 --> 24:04.480]  Of course, I recommend a place called Arbico Organics
[24:04.480 --> 24:06.040]  to get your beneficial nematodes.
[24:06.040 --> 24:07.000]  If you want their website,
[24:07.000 --> 24:12.000]  it is arbico, A-R-B-I-C-O dash organics dot com.
[24:12.560 --> 24:14.040]  They do not sponsor me.
[24:14.040 --> 24:16.480]  I do not pitch them because they pay me.
[24:16.480 --> 24:18.320]  I advertise for them because they send me
[24:18.320 --> 24:21.000]  a very helpful magazine in the mail every three months
[24:21.000 --> 24:23.440]  and it tells me which insects I should be using right now
[24:23.440 --> 24:26.280]  for the weather, for the environment,
[24:26.280 --> 24:27.120]  and it's very helpful.
[24:27.120 --> 24:28.960]  I trust them and I appreciate this company
[24:28.960 --> 24:30.840]  and they're very affordable and reliable.
[24:30.840 --> 24:32.520]  One thing I wanna mention,
[24:32.520 --> 24:36.120]  I mentioned some beneficial insects for other problems
[24:36.120 --> 24:38.400]  and I should tell you to pay attention
[24:38.400 --> 24:40.580]  to which predators you're purchasing
[24:40.580 --> 24:43.880]  because if you don't have the right environment for them,
[24:43.880 --> 24:46.080]  they will either die or leave.
[24:46.080 --> 24:47.320]  They will just scamper off
[24:47.320 --> 24:49.240]  and go somewhere where the environment's right.
[24:49.240 --> 24:52.640]  So when you were looking for perhaps an aphid predator,
[24:52.640 --> 24:54.560]  aphid predators, the ones on this page
[24:54.560 --> 24:55.620]  that I just happened to see,
[24:55.620 --> 24:58.680]  it says here they prefer 64 to 77 degrees
[24:58.680 --> 25:01.500]  with a moderate to 70% humidity.
[25:01.500 --> 25:02.880]  If you don't have that environment,
[25:02.880 --> 25:05.100]  you may need a different beneficial insect
[25:05.100 --> 25:07.080]  because those guys aren't gonna wanna hang out.
[25:07.080 --> 25:08.500]  They're gonna take off and go where it's better.
[25:08.500 --> 25:11.260]  Even if you've got food there, they don't like it.
[25:11.260 --> 25:12.720]  If you've got all of the good food,
[25:12.720 --> 25:14.680]  if you've got all the pizza and Dr. Pepper on the planet
[25:14.680 --> 25:16.220]  but it's 102 degrees,
[25:16.220 --> 25:18.240]  I still don't care about that pizza and Dr. Pepper.
[25:18.240 --> 25:19.080]  I'm gonna get the fuck out
[25:19.080 --> 25:20.920]  and go where it's about 75 degrees
[25:20.920 --> 25:23.080]  and I'll find some Dr. Pepper and pizza there.
[25:23.080 --> 25:25.040]  So you may need the right environment
[25:25.040 --> 25:27.040]  for your beneficial insects.
[25:27.040 --> 25:28.040]  Another thing that you can do
[25:28.040 --> 25:29.800]  if you see these thrips coming,
[25:29.800 --> 25:32.240]  neem oil helps get rid of the thrips.
[25:32.240 --> 25:33.800]  But like I've talked about before,
[25:33.800 --> 25:36.500]  neem oil will make your concentrates taste like shit.
[25:36.500 --> 25:39.040]  The other day I smoked some concentrate from a dispensary
[25:39.040 --> 25:41.120]  and I could taste the pesticides in it.
[25:41.120 --> 25:43.440]  It was not a pesticide, it was an essential oil.
[25:43.440 --> 25:46.040]  I hit it and I went, ooh, peppermint.
[25:46.040 --> 25:47.140]  And I didn't say anything out loud
[25:47.140 --> 25:48.960]  but I passed it to somebody else and they took a dab
[25:48.960 --> 25:49.860]  and I go, what do you think of that?
[25:49.860 --> 25:51.380]  And they said, it tastes like fucking peppermint.
[25:51.380 --> 25:53.260]  And I was like, all right, it's not in my head.
[25:53.260 --> 25:56.280]  You can taste the essential oils on plants, you guys.
[25:56.280 --> 25:59.440]  Only use neem and veg if you're going to use it at all.
[26:00.700 --> 26:03.180]  Another thing you can use to get rid of the thrips
[26:03.180 --> 26:04.980]  is spinosad.
[26:04.980 --> 26:06.940]  Spinosad is a fungus
[26:06.940 --> 26:10.300]  that happens at the bottom of whiskey barrels.
[26:10.300 --> 26:13.240]  It is a product, an off product of fermentation.
[26:14.100 --> 26:15.780]  You can spray it onto the plants
[26:15.780 --> 26:18.500]  and it will destroy most of the insects that are on there.
[26:18.500 --> 26:19.660]  It'll take down white flies
[26:20.460 --> 26:21.860]  and it'll certainly take down thrips.
[26:21.860 --> 26:23.780]  I called them flips in my head.
[26:23.780 --> 26:26.660]  Another thing I like is evergreen pyrethrum
[26:26.660 --> 26:28.300]  or evergreen pyganic.
[26:28.300 --> 26:29.500]  It works as a spray.
[26:29.500 --> 26:30.900]  You can spray your plants with it
[26:30.900 --> 26:32.820]  and you can drench the soil with it.
[26:32.820 --> 26:34.300]  I feel like if you do the combo,
[26:34.300 --> 26:36.640]  if you put up some yellow and blue sticky traps,
[26:36.640 --> 26:38.300]  you spray the plants with evergreen
[26:38.300 --> 26:40.080]  and you root drench with evergreen,
[26:40.080 --> 26:42.580]  everything except the plant will die.
[26:42.580 --> 26:45.420]  And that is organic and it is not too harmful.
[26:45.420 --> 26:48.660]  And if you do it early in veg and one time before flower,
[26:48.660 --> 26:51.340]  you should not have a problem with funky shit on your buds
[26:51.340 --> 26:53.160]  when it comes time to harvest.
[26:53.160 --> 26:54.920]  There should be a full nine weeks
[26:54.920 --> 26:57.260]  between spraying and harvest time.
[26:57.260 --> 26:58.180]  Hopefully that's long enough.
[26:58.180 --> 26:59.160]  Hopefully you're not fucking up
[26:59.160 --> 27:02.080]  and spraying too heavily concentrated of anything on there.
[27:02.080 --> 27:03.700]  The only thing I would really spray in flower
[27:03.700 --> 27:06.060]  is like a compost tea, maybe some push.
[27:06.060 --> 27:08.520]  I don't like hitting them a lot in flower.
[27:08.520 --> 27:10.140]  One reason you don't wanna spray them
[27:10.140 --> 27:12.100]  when they're in flower is because the buds start bulking up
[27:12.100 --> 27:13.420]  and the moisture gets inside the bud
[27:13.420 --> 27:15.500]  and you do run the risk of promoting bud rot.
[27:15.500 --> 27:16.860]  That's a big reason why I talk about
[27:16.860 --> 27:17.820]  not spraying in flower.
[27:17.820 --> 27:19.780]  Also, you're gonna mess up the flavor.
[27:19.780 --> 27:21.400]  You're gonna mess up the taste of those buds
[27:21.400 --> 27:23.180]  that you're growing for nine weeks.
[27:23.180 --> 27:25.600]  Why spray some shit on them, fuck up the flavor,
[27:25.600 --> 27:26.700]  when you can leave them the way they are
[27:26.700 --> 27:29.400]  and it tastes super delicious if you do it right.
[27:29.400 --> 27:31.540]  So one thing I just thought of that I didn't say,
[27:31.540 --> 27:34.200]  let the soil dry, throw down some diatomaceous earth,
[27:34.200 --> 27:36.500]  soak with the evergreen, spray with the evergreen,
[27:36.500 --> 27:38.140]  put up the yellow and blue sticky cards,
[27:38.140 --> 27:39.620]  you should be golden, you shouldn't have any bugs.
[27:39.620 --> 27:43.800]  That should get rid of most of your bug problems, I hope,
[27:43.800 --> 27:46.220]  unless you've got a serious infestation
[27:46.220 --> 27:50.380]  that should really solve 75% of your bug problems.
[27:50.380 --> 27:52.340]  All right, guys, of course, another thing you can do
[27:52.340 --> 27:56.340]  to get rid of your thrips are pirate bugs.
[27:56.340 --> 27:58.500]  There's a bug called the minute pirate bug,
[27:58.500 --> 28:02.140]  the aureus insidious, this sucker's ugly.
[28:03.060 --> 28:05.780]  He eats thrips, whiteflies, spider mites, aphids,
[28:05.780 --> 28:07.780]  and all kinds of other stuff, you guys.
[28:08.980 --> 28:10.660]  He loves to get in there and eat stuff in your garden.
[28:10.660 --> 28:13.580]  He is a very versatile insect.
[28:13.580 --> 28:16.540]  He will thrive in an indoor and a greenhouse.
[28:16.540 --> 28:17.780]  He's something I highly recommend.
[28:17.780 --> 28:21.320]  Also, predatory mites, the swarski mites that I recommended
[28:21.320 --> 28:25.660]  for your spider mites will also work very well on thrips.
[28:25.660 --> 28:27.460]  All right, you guys, now I hope you are able
[28:27.460 --> 28:28.620]  to identify thrips.
[28:28.620 --> 28:30.100]  It looks like a little fucker's been crawling
[28:30.100 --> 28:31.880]  on your plants and shitting their shiny stuff
[28:31.880 --> 28:33.300]  and just chewing holes in it.
[28:33.300 --> 28:35.020]  It kind of looks like there's glitter on your plants.
[28:35.020 --> 28:36.380]  Maybe the leaves are starting to curl up
[28:36.380 --> 28:37.260]  and wilt a little bit.
[28:37.260 --> 28:38.980]  They're starting to look dry in certain patches.
[28:38.980 --> 28:40.780]  Maybe they're getting a little bit crispy.
[28:40.780 --> 28:42.300]  You've probably got thrips in there.
[28:42.300 --> 28:44.180]  It's time to get out a magnifying glass.
[28:44.180 --> 28:46.100]  It's time to identify exactly what you've got.
[28:46.100 --> 28:49.260]  It's time to treat for probably thrips.
[28:49.260 --> 28:50.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you learned a lot
[28:50.540 --> 28:51.940]  from me on this episode.
[28:51.940 --> 28:53.600]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friends
[28:53.600 --> 28:54.980]  at the Dude Grows Show.
[28:54.980 --> 28:58.500]  The Dude Grows podcast gave the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[28:58.500 --> 29:01.340]  Ross DeGeff specifically, White Mike specifically,
[29:01.340 --> 29:03.020]  we all got personal huge shout outs
[29:03.020 --> 29:04.340]  from the Dude Grows Show.
[29:04.340 --> 29:06.380]  We were also given personal invitations
[29:06.380 --> 29:07.860]  to the Dude Grows event.
[29:08.820 --> 29:11.220]  Myself, White Mike, the Dabbing Granny,
[29:11.220 --> 29:12.620]  Lindsey the Traveling Stoner,
[29:12.620 --> 29:15.260]  and Chris, also known as Bobo Blaster Co.,
[29:15.260 --> 29:16.860]  were all given open invitations
[29:16.860 --> 29:18.380]  to come to the Dude Grows event,
[29:18.380 --> 29:19.660]  which is kind of a private party
[29:19.660 --> 29:21.920]  that he is hosting in April.
[29:21.920 --> 29:23.420]  Dude, if you were listening to this,
[29:23.420 --> 29:27.160]  Dude and Scotty both, much respect, much thanks.
[29:27.160 --> 29:28.000]  I will be there.
[29:28.000 --> 29:28.860]  I look forward to it.
[29:28.860 --> 29:30.340]  I'm going to bring my Zoom H6
[29:30.340 --> 29:32.500]  and I'm going to try to record a podcast.
[29:32.500 --> 29:34.700]  My goal is just to record part of the event
[29:34.700 --> 29:36.260]  and then I will send you the file
[29:36.260 --> 29:38.160]  and we will both hopefully post it up
[29:38.160 --> 29:39.220]  as a podcast together.
[29:39.220 --> 29:40.100]  That's what I have in mind.
[29:40.260 --> 29:42.300]  I'm going to try to do that, you guys.
[29:42.300 --> 29:45.180]  Big shout out to my friends at the Dude Grows Show.
[29:45.180 --> 29:47.060]  Also, since I'm spreading love to podcasters,
[29:47.060 --> 29:48.460]  I want to give a huge shout out to Bo Nellis.
[29:48.460 --> 29:50.340]  Bo Nellis has been giving me a lot of respect
[29:50.340 --> 29:51.420]  and I want her to know
[29:51.420 --> 29:54.680]  that the respect is completely returned.
[29:54.680 --> 29:57.620]  Much love to everybody in the cannabis podcasting community.
[29:57.620 --> 29:59.020]  I love seeing us come together.
[29:59.020 --> 30:00.780]  I love seeing us share information.
[30:00.780 --> 30:02.020]  I feel no intimidation.
[30:02.020 --> 30:04.020]  I feel there's no competition.
[30:04.020 --> 30:05.660]  I want it all to be a community.
[30:05.660 --> 30:07.380]  Much love, much respect to everybody
[30:07.380 --> 30:09.700]  spreading the word and fighting the good fight for cannabis.
[30:09.700 --> 30:12.900]  We're all on one team and I appreciate it.
[30:12.900 --> 30:15.020]  I'd love to do a podcast with everybody out there
[30:15.020 --> 30:16.340]  that's got a cannabis podcast.
[30:16.340 --> 30:17.780]  We can all get together and do shows
[30:17.780 --> 30:20.380]  and expose each other's audience to each other's audiences.
[30:20.380 --> 30:22.780]  I think it'd be a great thing to happen.
[30:22.780 --> 30:23.620]  All right, you guys,
[30:23.620 --> 30:25.600]  I would love to hear what you feel about the podcast.
[30:25.600 --> 30:26.440]  You can go to iTunes.
[30:26.440 --> 30:27.900]  You can leave me a comment on iTunes.
[30:27.900 --> 30:28.740]  If you don't want to do that,
[30:28.740 --> 30:30.140]  you can find me on the social media,
[30:30.140 --> 30:32.540]  on Facebook, search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[30:32.540 --> 30:35.140]  On Twitter, it's at GFYH podcast.
[30:35.140 --> 30:37.780]  On Instagram, I use my company name.
[30:37.780 --> 30:39.940]  It's Irie underscore genetics.
[30:39.940 --> 30:42.420]  I-R-I-E underscore genetics.
[30:42.420 --> 30:44.140]  Irie is a Jamaican word.
[30:44.140 --> 30:46.780]  It pretty much means to be as blessed as you could be
[30:46.780 --> 30:48.620]  or to feel as good as you could feel.
[30:48.620 --> 30:50.860]  I describe it as kind of that feeling
[30:50.860 --> 30:52.600]  when you're sitting in the grass under a tree,
[30:52.600 --> 30:54.780]  you got your dog or your best friend sitting next to you,
[30:54.780 --> 30:57.420]  you got a fat joint in your hand, nothing's wrong.
[30:57.420 --> 30:59.100]  The wind is blowing just right in your hair.
[30:59.100 --> 30:59.940]  The sun is setting.
[30:59.940 --> 31:02.100]  It's nice and cool and everything feels good.
[31:02.100 --> 31:03.660]  You got that inner peace feeling.
[31:03.660 --> 31:05.940]  You feel Irie, just chilling,
[31:05.940 --> 31:07.500]  not worried about a damn thing.
[31:08.340 --> 31:10.500]  So that's what Irie means, you guys.
[31:10.500 --> 31:12.500]  Irie underscore genetics is my Instagram.
[31:12.500 --> 31:14.420]  I'd love it if you followed me there.
[31:14.420 --> 31:15.420]  If you'd like to reach out to me
[31:15.420 --> 31:17.020]  and you're not into the social media stuff,
[31:17.020 --> 31:17.940]  you can email me.
[31:17.940 --> 31:19.900]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[31:19.900 --> 31:21.100]  I would love to hear from you.
[31:21.100 --> 31:23.180]  I would love to hear what you have to say.
[31:23.180 --> 31:24.700]  All right, guys, I'm gonna wrap up this podcast.
[31:24.700 --> 31:25.540]  I wanna give a huge shout out
[31:25.540 --> 31:27.620]  to my friends Tim and Charlie in New Mexico.
[31:27.620 --> 31:29.380]  Shout out to everybody at Organica.
[31:29.380 --> 31:31.500]  And until next time, take a fat dab
[31:31.500 --> 31:32.900]  and give your mom a hug for me.
