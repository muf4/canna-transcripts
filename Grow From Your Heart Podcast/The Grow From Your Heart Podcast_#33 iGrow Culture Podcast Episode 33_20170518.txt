[00:35.030 --> 00:38.030]  The top shelf extracts, I won't settle for the rest
[00:38.030 --> 00:41.030]  No, it's gotta be that proper, give me highest helicopters
[00:41.030 --> 00:44.030]  Chest thumpin' like a chaper corpin' like I need a doctor
[00:44.030 --> 00:47.030]  Talkin' slow like a mobster, leanin' low in my chair
[00:47.030 --> 00:50.030]  Thinkin' what should I hit next, could you high off the air?
[00:50.030 --> 00:53.030]  Dabbin' with the judges, extract extraordinaires

[01:10.030 --> 01:13.030]  That's the game of the event and most'll never find her neither
[01:13.030 --> 01:16.030]  Welcome to the cup, welcome to the cup
[01:16.030 --> 01:19.030]  Welcome to the cup, grab it towards the bar and us
[01:19.030 --> 01:20.030]  Welcome to the cup
[01:31.030 --> 01:34.030]  Hi, I'm Andrew. You're listening to the Secret Cup Anthem by Hydro.
[01:34.030 --> 01:37.030]  The Secret Cup was in Denver this weekend and our boy Spence
[01:37.030 --> 01:40.030]  from the Garden of Weden took home first place
[01:40.030 --> 01:43.030]  in the Secret Cup Mountain Region.
[01:43.030 --> 01:46.030]  Coming up in just a couple of minutes, I'll have an interview with Spence.

[03:25.030 --> 03:28.030]  possible. I had Spence over and we did a great interview
[03:28.030 --> 03:31.030]  so I'm not going to waste much more time with an intro.
[03:31.030 --> 03:40.930]  Let's get right to the interview part. Here we go.
[03:40.930 --> 03:43.930]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are back and we're hanging out
[03:43.930 --> 03:46.930]  with the winner of the Secret Cup Mountain Regional
[03:46.930 --> 03:49.930]  We got our buddy from the Garden of Weden, it's Spence. How are you doing today buddy?
[03:49.930 --> 03:52.930]  Good brother, how are you? I'm doing good bro. I was just told that
[03:52.930 --> 03:55.930]  there's a Garden of Weden song written by our boy Sloppy
[03:55.930 --> 03:58.930]  and it is freaking sweet. Yeah, it's pretty tight. Shout out to Sloppy.
[03:58.930 --> 04:01.930]  Big shout out to our boy Sloppy. What's up brother? Thanks for listening to the podcast.
[04:01.930 --> 04:04.930]  I'm going to play your song at the end of the show. Thanks for permission in the future.
[04:04.930 --> 04:07.930]  Spencer said I could play it. I gave him permission.
[04:07.930 --> 04:10.930]  And it says Garden of Weden in it so it's all Spence.
[04:10.930 --> 04:13.930]  So thanks for joining me on the show bro. No doubt. For sure.
[04:13.930 --> 04:16.930]  Always a pleasure to be here. Oh man, it's always fun taking dabs with you.
[04:16.930 --> 04:19.930]  We hang out a lot and I like it.
[04:19.930 --> 04:22.930]  So Spence is the winner of the Mountain
[04:22.930 --> 04:25.930]  Region Secret Cup. Some people might not be
[04:25.930 --> 04:28.930]  familiar with the Secret Cup so let's take a little bit to tell them what that is.
[04:28.930 --> 04:31.930]  The Secret Cup is a
[04:31.930 --> 04:34.930]  well it's actually a tour
[04:34.930 --> 04:37.930]  which they go to different places. They go to two places in Cali
[04:37.930 --> 04:40.930]  if I'm correct. I don't know if it's
[04:40.930 --> 04:43.930]  ever been put that way as a tour because that would be a hell of a
[04:43.930 --> 04:46.930]  marketing way to put some shirts out. Yeah, sure.
[04:46.930 --> 04:49.930]  I mean that's how I think of it. It's a tour and there's a championship in the middle
[04:49.930 --> 04:52.930]  at the end of the tour. That's a good way to put it. I hope they're listening and they get a
[04:52.930 --> 04:55.930]  marketing idea from that. But yeah, California,
[04:55.930 --> 04:58.930]  Seattle, here, maybe
[04:58.930 --> 05:01.930]  Michigan, I'm not sure, Arizona, Rhode Island and then
[05:01.930 --> 05:04.930]  all the it's basically a competition of
[05:04.930 --> 05:07.930]  anywhere from 30 to 40 hashmakers
[05:07.930 --> 05:10.930]  all enter a certain amount of
[05:10.930 --> 05:13.930]  product and then each one of the
[05:13.930 --> 05:16.930]  people that enter are considered judges because we all receive a judge pack
[05:16.930 --> 05:19.930]  go through them and kind of give everything
[05:19.930 --> 05:22.930]  a score from smell, strength,
[05:22.930 --> 05:25.930]  smoothness, harshness, color, flavor
[05:25.930 --> 05:28.930]  down the line.
[05:28.930 --> 05:31.930]  So each contestant actually gets .3
[05:31.930 --> 05:34.930]  of every sample, right? Yeah. So you get to taste
[05:34.930 --> 05:37.930]  what everybody else has done or what everybody else entered and you're the judge, right?
[05:37.930 --> 05:40.930]  Yeah, and we're the judges so that's kind of a good thing
[05:40.930 --> 05:43.930]  about it. It's not being judged by just
[05:43.930 --> 05:46.930]  random people or like
[05:46.930 --> 05:49.930]  it's not a, well it's technically a blind judge
[05:49.930 --> 05:52.930]  because nobody gets to see what
[05:52.930 --> 05:55.930]  everybody's entries are so it's all just numbered and whatever
[05:55.930 --> 05:58.930]  numbers are what you vote for. So when you got your judges kit,
[05:58.930 --> 06:01.930]  how long did it take you to find your
[06:01.930 --> 06:04.930]  entry? Like two minutes. Two minutes, yeah.
[06:04.930 --> 06:07.930]  You just had a lot of taste. Yeah, well I just
[06:07.930 --> 06:10.930]  you could go through the entries and kind of just smell and
[06:10.930 --> 06:13.930]  I make the hash so you kind of get attached
[06:13.930 --> 06:16.930]  I guess you could say to like you know which is yours
[06:16.930 --> 06:19.930]  and what is not. I had a, there was a couple that I was like eh maybe
[06:19.930 --> 06:22.930]  and then as soon as you find it, it's perfect. It's like yeah, that's it.
[06:22.930 --> 06:25.930]  I can tell my flowers. Sorry guys, I'm all choked up
[06:25.930 --> 06:28.930]  actually I went to the secret cup for two days and took an amazing
[06:28.930 --> 06:31.930]  amount of dabs and then today I went and hung out with some friends in Denver
[06:31.930 --> 06:34.930]  and my lungs and throat are burnt out from dabbing. You guys gotta
[06:34.930 --> 06:37.930]  hydrate if you're dabbing. That's something that I'm learning. More hydration
[06:37.930 --> 06:40.930]  Spence reaches through the water as I say that. We're all red eyed
[06:40.930 --> 06:43.930]  and throat dried.
[06:43.930 --> 06:46.930]  So yeah, everybody got to, I had the honor of tasting
[06:46.930 --> 06:49.930]  a couple of my friends were judges and entrance contenders
[06:49.930 --> 06:52.930]  I don't know what the hell they were called. They were judges and they entered and I got to taste
[06:52.930 --> 06:55.930]  parts of their sample packs. Some were amazing
[06:55.930 --> 06:58.930]  some I don't think I would take
[06:58.930 --> 07:01.930]  a second dab of a lot of those. Yeah, I mean there's definitely
[07:02.930 --> 07:05.930]  there's 38
[07:05.930 --> 07:08.930]  competitors in this one so 38.3s
[07:08.930 --> 07:11.930]  you got to go through and you know it's kind of
[07:11.930 --> 07:14.930]  tough depending on what kind of
[07:14.930 --> 07:17.930]  like I'm a weed snob so I'm definitely going to be an oil
[07:17.930 --> 07:20.930]  snob. You know what I'm saying? So it's just a lot of it's
[07:20.930 --> 07:23.930]  personal preference whether or not you like it this way or you like it that way
[07:23.930 --> 07:26.930]  so it's kind of that's why it's good that we're
[07:26.930 --> 07:29.930]  the judges because it's at least honest opinions.
[07:29.930 --> 07:32.930]  I wanted to wait a little bit to get into live resin but
[07:32.930 --> 07:35.930]  I was worried with you entering live resin people were going to say it's not
[07:35.930 --> 07:38.930]  stable because the popular shit, the rage is shattered
[07:38.930 --> 07:41.930]  and the live resin is not shattery at all
[07:41.930 --> 07:44.930]  it's kind of it looks like oil. Yeah it's like
[07:44.930 --> 07:47.930]  oil and then depending where it's at
[07:47.930 --> 07:50.930]  you know it's I think somebody said 66
[07:50.930 --> 07:53.930]  degrees is when it actually gets it'll shatter
[07:53.930 --> 07:56.930]  if your house is 66 degrees you like
[07:56.930 --> 07:59.930]  your house cold you'll have shattery live resin
[07:59.930 --> 08:02.930]  but it's almost that in here tonight it's getting nice and cool in Colorado
[08:02.930 --> 08:05.930]  temperatures are changing. Oh yeah like this oil is cool right now it's
[08:05.930 --> 08:08.930]  chilling. Hey thanks dude the other day
[08:08.930 --> 08:11.930]  you gave me a little sample of Earl and I didn't even realize that I've been
[08:11.930 --> 08:14.930]  dabbing off of the entry I've been dabbing the winner here
[08:14.930 --> 08:17.930]  for several days thank you that's just tasty
[08:17.930 --> 08:20.930]  thank you. So in a second we'll
[08:20.930 --> 08:23.930]  talk about what's in that. The event we kind of talked about
[08:23.930 --> 08:26.930]  what it is the people that enter are the judges
[08:26.930 --> 08:29.930]  everybody gets to taste the entries
[08:29.930 --> 08:32.930]  so that's what it's all about and Spence was actually
[08:32.930 --> 08:35.930]  chosen as the overall champion
[08:35.930 --> 08:38.930]  there's a couple other things I want to talk about there was two location
[08:38.930 --> 08:41.930]  changes. Yeah if not
[08:41.930 --> 08:44.930]  if you could probably count three because the venues
[08:44.930 --> 08:47.930]  in Denver got switched twice. I want to give a huge shout out
[08:47.930 --> 08:50.930]  to Big D right now Big D was smart enough he
[08:50.930 --> 08:53.930]  hired a professional event company he hired the
[08:53.930 --> 08:56.930]  right event services group right event groups
[08:56.930 --> 08:59.930]  or something you know what I mean the right group was in charge
[08:59.930 --> 09:02.930]  they booked and secured a location as they
[09:02.930 --> 09:05.930]  got there and started to set up they were told that they were not allowed to do
[09:05.930 --> 09:08.930]  the event there. Big D is smart enough to where he just
[09:08.930 --> 09:11.930]  made another phone call and said hey everybody go to location number two
[09:11.930 --> 09:14.930]  he had a second spot lined up. Unfortunately
[09:14.930 --> 09:17.930]  that got shut down also
[09:17.930 --> 09:20.930]  so I think AJ Hashman made a couple of phone calls
[09:20.930 --> 09:23.930]  and a couple of emails were sent and the Lazy Lion
[09:23.930 --> 09:26.930]  sorry about the cough again guys I'm really sorry that sucks to do a podcast
[09:26.930 --> 09:29.930]  with that I bet it sucks to hear the Lazy Lion and the
[09:29.930 --> 09:32.930]  Speakeasy Vape Lounge volunteered to let the Secret Cup
[09:32.930 --> 09:35.930]  come have their party there. They already had shit booked for that night
[09:35.930 --> 09:38.930]  they canceled it and they came and they let us come
[09:38.930 --> 09:41.930]  and have a huge party there so big shout out to
[09:41.930 --> 09:44.930]  Big D, AJ Hashman and everybody involved with the
[09:44.930 --> 09:47.930]  Speakeasy and the Lazy Lion that was super cool. A lot of the vendors
[09:47.930 --> 09:50.930]  packed right on up and came with them most of the booths were full
[09:50.930 --> 09:53.930]  most of the artists came. Saturday was a little
[09:53.930 --> 09:56.930]  kind of bare but Sunday was pretty crowded in there.
[09:56.930 --> 09:59.930]  It got crowded just depending on what time of the day it was.
[09:59.930 --> 10:02.930]  Yeah the Speakeasy was pretty neat I was able to get into
[10:02.930 --> 10:05.930]  the Speakeasy the Lazy Lion was actually the VIP lounge
[10:05.930 --> 10:08.930]  so I didn't have my VIP badge so I couldn't go in there
[10:08.930 --> 10:11.930]  so I had to go in there and I was able to get in
[10:11.930 --> 10:14.930]  The Lazy Lion by far have the headiest glass collection
[10:14.930 --> 10:17.930]  I've seen ever. Nice.
[10:17.930 --> 10:20.930]  Have you ever seen that
[10:20.930 --> 10:23.930]  what is it?
[10:23.930 --> 10:26.930]  Joe Peters Queen Bee? It's like a huge
[10:26.930 --> 10:29.930]  I think I saw the picture that Maddie posted of it
[10:29.930 --> 10:32.930]  shout out to Maddie. What's up Maddie?
[10:32.930 --> 10:35.930]  That piece is like 80k. I don't even want to touch it.
[10:35.930 --> 10:38.930]  I don't even want to say that.
[10:38.930 --> 10:41.930]  Are you able to hit it?
[10:41.930 --> 10:44.930]  I was going to say that's crazy. Half the rigs are just for display.
[10:44.930 --> 10:47.930]  I did see a bong with a goldfish swimming in it.
[10:47.930 --> 10:50.930]  It's labeled not to smoke out of it.
[10:50.930 --> 10:53.930]  It's like please don't smoke out of this.
[10:53.930 --> 10:56.930]  It's a beta fish actually I said goldfish it's a beta.
[10:56.930 --> 10:59.930]  That's pretty novel. Yeah.
[10:59.930 --> 11:02.930]  I'm surprised no one's thought of that before.
[11:02.930 --> 11:05.930]  Shout out to the places and people that made that happen.
[11:05.930 --> 11:08.930]  Your entry was live resin.
[11:08.930 --> 11:11.930]  Do you want to tell the people what strain it was?
[11:11.930 --> 11:14.930]  It's already out.
[11:14.930 --> 11:17.930]  It was Senzo G from Sin City Seeds.
[11:17.930 --> 11:20.930]  It was mixed with Scotts OG from Rare Dankness.
[11:20.930 --> 11:23.930]  Classy mix.
[11:23.930 --> 11:26.930]  Yeah.
[11:26.930 --> 11:29.930]  The Senzo G was a Kosher Kush dominant
[11:29.930 --> 11:32.930]  Fino I guess you'd call it.
[11:32.930 --> 11:35.930]  If you guys need to know about Fino types
[11:35.930 --> 11:38.930]  go back a few episodes.
[11:38.930 --> 11:41.930]  Scotts OG was just an awesome OG.
[11:41.930 --> 11:44.930]  It was definitely lanky.
[11:44.930 --> 11:47.930]  Not super tall but it was taller than I would usually like plants to be.
[11:47.930 --> 11:50.930]  Super fuel-y
[11:50.930 --> 11:53.930]  and heavy indica.
[11:53.930 --> 11:56.930]  Awesome resin production.
[11:56.930 --> 11:59.930]  It was a really good mix.
[11:59.930 --> 12:02.930]  That was the one I mixed with the Sins which was a Kosher dominant.
[12:02.930 --> 12:05.930]  The Sins OG is blue power and Kosher Kush.
[12:05.930 --> 12:08.930]  It was a Kosher Kush dominant Fino.
[12:08.930 --> 12:11.930]  It just had a way better kosher burnt rubber
[12:11.930 --> 12:14.930]  ishy smell which comes out
[12:14.930 --> 12:17.930]  and hashes an OG smell.
[12:17.930 --> 12:20.930]  It's got a fuel-y funk.
[12:20.930 --> 12:23.930]  It's got a really good smell.
[12:23.930 --> 12:26.930]  It's got a really good smell.
[12:26.930 --> 12:29.930]  It's got a fuel-y funk.
[12:29.930 --> 12:32.930]  This hash definitely has a fuel-y funk to it.
[12:32.930 --> 12:35.930]  It's delicious.
[12:35.930 --> 12:38.930]  I smoke a lot of sativas because I'm a sativa breeder.
[12:38.930 --> 12:41.930]  I smoke a lot of sativa in this indica.
[12:41.930 --> 12:44.930]  It really sits me down and makes my eyes droopy.
[12:44.930 --> 12:47.930]  I really appreciate it.
[12:47.930 --> 12:50.930]  It's a really nice cross.
[12:50.930 --> 12:53.930]  What's got the citrus-y spice to it?
[12:53.930 --> 12:56.930]  It comes from the Scotts.
[12:56.930 --> 12:59.930]  You get a little bit of lemon.
[12:59.930 --> 13:02.930]  That OG pine-ness.
[13:02.930 --> 13:05.930]  Sometimes the pine can transfer over to a citrus-y lemon.
[13:05.930 --> 13:08.930]  It was a good strain.
[13:08.930 --> 13:11.930]  It was a Fino hunt.
[13:11.930 --> 13:14.930]  I ran a pack and I kept 3 or 4 of them.
[13:14.930 --> 13:17.930]  There were 3 or 4 of them in the room and I got to pick which ones I wanted to make the entry with.
[13:17.930 --> 13:20.930]  It's really cool being able to actually go in
[13:20.930 --> 13:23.930]  and pick what flavors a lot of the people who won were like,
[13:23.930 --> 13:26.930]  thanks to this person for letting me get the product.
[13:26.930 --> 13:29.930]  It was cool for us because I don't have to ask anybody for product.
[13:29.930 --> 13:32.930]  It all comes from us.
[13:32.930 --> 13:35.930]  All in-house is great.
[13:35.930 --> 13:38.930]  I've seen your garden.
[13:38.930 --> 13:41.930]  It's a clean, safe garden where my medicine comes from.
[13:41.930 --> 13:44.930]  I get a lot of my extracts straight from you guys.
[13:44.930 --> 13:47.930]  I'm kind of picky about where I'll get it.
[13:47.930 --> 13:50.930]  You guys are the first people I go to when I need medicine.
[13:50.930 --> 13:53.930]  When you're looking in the room,
[13:53.930 --> 13:56.930]  what makes you say that strain or that plant
[13:56.930 --> 13:59.930]  or that plant right there are going to make award-winning oil?
[13:59.930 --> 14:02.930]  Honestly,
[14:02.930 --> 14:05.930]  it's more of just
[14:05.930 --> 14:08.930]  you literally go plant to plant.
[14:08.930 --> 14:11.930]  You can't do it in a day.
[14:11.930 --> 14:14.930]  It takes a week or two.
[14:14.930 --> 14:17.930]  As they're finishing to be able to tell which flavors are going to come through.
[14:17.930 --> 14:20.930]  I don't even think.
[14:20.930 --> 14:23.930]  I was going to do.
[14:23.930 --> 14:26.930]  I made another batch, the green ribbon batch.
[14:26.930 --> 14:29.930]  The green ribbon just didn't carry the same.
[14:29.930 --> 14:32.930]  When you feel some plants,
[14:32.930 --> 14:35.930]  some plants are super sticky where you touch them
[14:35.930 --> 14:38.930]  and your fingers are stuck together.
[14:38.930 --> 14:41.930]  There's some you touch and you get the stringiness.
[14:41.930 --> 14:44.930]  There's some you touch where it's wet.
[14:44.930 --> 14:47.930]  It's slick.
[14:47.930 --> 14:50.930]  You just go and look for different.
[14:50.930 --> 14:53.930]  For me, it's a lot about flavors.
[14:53.930 --> 14:56.930]  Your hash is always flavorful.
[14:56.930 --> 14:59.930]  I had a bunch of your shatter with me at the secret cup.
[14:59.930 --> 15:02.930]  Everybody I would dab out would go,
[15:02.930 --> 15:05.930]  that's tasty.
[15:05.930 --> 15:08.930]  It was a lot of golden goat that you made and some cookies that you made.
[15:08.930 --> 15:11.930]  Shout out to vigor lover.
[15:11.930 --> 15:14.930]  Edit it right there.
[15:14.930 --> 15:17.930]  Somehow he got to me some solventless hash
[15:17.930 --> 15:20.930]  that tastes pretty damn good.
[15:20.930 --> 15:23.930]  I'm going to have to edit some of that.
[15:23.930 --> 15:26.930]  Hashtag team mids.
[15:26.930 --> 15:29.930]  Poor guy cannot get away from that.
[15:29.930 --> 15:32.930]  We talk a lot about live resin on this show.
[15:32.930 --> 15:35.930]  I am not a hash maker.
[15:35.930 --> 15:38.930]  I have a lot of people that compliment me on my hash.
[15:38.930 --> 15:41.930]  I don't make hash.
[15:41.930 --> 15:44.930]  I know a lot about making hash.
[15:44.930 --> 15:47.930]  Little Kev is my buddy.
[15:47.930 --> 15:50.930]  I know how to read.
[15:50.930 --> 15:53.930]  I like to be educated.
[15:53.930 --> 15:56.930]  I've been trying my best to describe live resin to people.
[15:56.930 --> 15:59.930]  A lot of people have asked about it.
[15:59.930 --> 16:02.930]  After you exhale that monstrous dab,
[16:02.930 --> 16:05.930]  you can't breathe.
[16:05.930 --> 16:08.930]  You can't breathe.
[16:08.930 --> 16:11.930]  Will you teach me and our listeners a little lesson
[16:11.930 --> 16:14.930]  about what live resin is and how it's done?
[16:14.930 --> 16:17.930]  Everybody has heard of
[16:17.930 --> 16:20.930]  fresh frozen bubble hash.
[16:20.930 --> 16:23.930]  Where you harvest your plant,
[16:23.930 --> 16:26.930]  you essentially freeze it or flash freeze it.
[16:26.930 --> 16:29.930]  For ice hash,
[16:29.930 --> 16:32.930]  it's a little bit different.
[16:32.930 --> 16:35.930]  As far as opening blasting,
[16:35.930 --> 16:38.930]  I know people who do it,
[16:38.930 --> 16:41.930]  but once the closed loop game came out
[16:41.930 --> 16:44.930]  and we figured out you could do that same process
[16:44.930 --> 16:47.930]  in a closed loop at a bigger scale,
[16:47.930 --> 16:50.930]  it completely changes hash for the better.
[16:50.930 --> 16:53.930]  I think so.
[16:53.930 --> 16:56.930]  It's fresh frozen closed loop.
[16:56.930 --> 16:59.930]  I'm going to go a little slower on that one.
[16:59.930 --> 17:02.930]  He's taking plants that are ready for harvest,
[17:02.930 --> 17:05.930]  chop them down, freeze them in the deep freeze,
[17:05.930 --> 17:08.930]  and then put them in a closed loop butane extraction system.
[17:08.930 --> 17:11.930]  We'll talk more about that.
[17:11.930 --> 17:14.930]  I think Kevin and I have talked about that.
[17:14.930 --> 17:17.930]  There's open blasting and closed loop.
[17:17.930 --> 17:20.930]  Spence uses a closed loop method and blasts the fresh frozen like that.
[17:20.930 --> 17:23.930]  Does it need to be vacuum purged after that?
[17:23.930 --> 17:26.930]  Through your system,
[17:26.930 --> 17:29.930]  it takes a lot of the butane out
[17:29.930 --> 17:32.930]  before you even get to touch the product.
[17:32.930 --> 17:35.930]  Using that closed loop?
[17:35.930 --> 17:38.930]  Using the closed loop.
[17:38.930 --> 17:41.930]  It pumps it out because it takes all the liquid back out.
[17:41.930 --> 17:44.930]  Then you're left with just your product.
[17:44.930 --> 17:47.930]  As far as flavors,
[17:47.930 --> 17:50.930]  I really think it keeps a better turp profile.
[17:50.930 --> 17:53.930]  It tastes like it smells when it's growing.
[17:53.930 --> 17:56.930]  When you touch a plant and smell your fingers,
[17:56.930 --> 17:59.930]  that crazy smell you get,
[17:59.930 --> 18:02.930]  it doesn't ever smell like that once it's dried and cured.
[18:02.930 --> 18:05.930]  But when you're stripping
[18:05.930 --> 18:08.930]  or making hash from a fresh product,
[18:08.930 --> 18:11.930]  you get that fresh flavor.
[18:11.930 --> 18:14.930]  It's like if your bud was a fruit and you took a bite out of that fruit.
[18:14.930 --> 18:17.930]  That's what this hash tastes like.
[18:17.930 --> 18:20.930]  The turp profile in there,
[18:20.930 --> 18:23.930]  everyone's new word now is turps, turps, turps.
[18:23.930 --> 18:26.930]  I feel like an asshole every time I say turps.
[18:26.930 --> 18:29.930]  The turps in that is turpy slurpy.
[18:29.930 --> 18:32.930]  It's like a bite of candy every time you hit a dab of it.
[18:32.930 --> 18:35.930]  It's amazing.
[18:35.930 --> 18:38.930]  It could be dessert.
[18:38.930 --> 18:41.930]  Somebody needs to make some jelly bean live resin.
[18:41.930 --> 18:44.930]  Blueberry sour diesel?
[18:44.930 --> 18:47.930]  I think it's a good idea.
[18:47.930 --> 18:50.930]  It sounds delicious.
[18:50.930 --> 18:53.930]  Some tangy.
[18:53.930 --> 18:56.930]  I made cookies live.
[18:56.930 --> 18:59.930]  We got to cross some tangy and some grateful dog.
[18:59.930 --> 19:02.930]  See?
[19:02.930 --> 19:05.930]  The tangerine dog.
[19:05.930 --> 19:08.930]  I've been writing down strain names.
[19:08.930 --> 19:11.930]  If you have neat strain names,
[19:11.930 --> 19:14.930]  I'll be happy to tweet them.
[19:14.930 --> 19:17.930]  I'll be happy to tweet them if I can find your tweet.
[19:17.930 --> 19:20.930]  Live res is basically
[19:20.930 --> 19:23.930]  a fresh frozen VHO.
[19:23.930 --> 19:26.930]  I think it's a more flavorful.
[19:26.930 --> 19:29.930]  Vacuum purging it?
[19:29.930 --> 19:32.930]  Everything I do goes into an oven
[19:32.930 --> 19:35.930]  after you extract it from your system.
[19:35.930 --> 19:38.930]  Your system takes a good majority of it out.
[19:38.930 --> 19:41.930]  I keep cleaning and removing certain gases.
[19:41.930 --> 19:44.930]  Do you do anything special to your plants or flowers
[19:44.930 --> 19:47.930]  if you know you're going to make oil out of them?
[19:47.930 --> 19:50.930]  No.
[19:50.930 --> 19:53.930]  I have done
[19:53.930 --> 19:56.930]  48 hours of dark before.
[19:56.930 --> 19:59.930]  I really think
[19:59.930 --> 20:02.930]  as far as live, it's all about the product you put in.
[20:02.930 --> 20:05.930]  The better the flowers
[20:05.930 --> 20:08.930]  that are going in, the better the oil is going to come out.
[20:08.930 --> 20:11.930]  No trim run in this room?
[20:11.930 --> 20:14.930]  I'll pass.
[20:14.930 --> 20:17.930]  Honestly, from my personal stuff,
[20:17.930 --> 20:20.930]  I still open blast it and I'll make it.
[20:20.930 --> 20:23.930]  I think it comes out better than the closed loop.
[20:23.930 --> 20:26.930]  It's good for patients.
[20:26.930 --> 20:29.930]  I'll stick with this nug run.
[20:29.930 --> 20:32.930]  I can almost tell the difference.
[20:32.930 --> 20:35.930]  Once you start smoking live,
[20:35.930 --> 20:38.930]  you can taste the difference
[20:38.930 --> 20:41.930]  between if it's in a closed loop and if it's not.
[20:41.930 --> 20:44.930]  I feel super spoiled now that I smoke so much live.
[20:44.930 --> 20:47.930]  I find myself hiding my live.
[20:47.930 --> 20:50.930]  We can smoke this shatter all day.
[20:50.930 --> 20:53.930]  I'll bark at you like a dog if you get near it.
[20:53.930 --> 20:56.930]  A little bit more about the secret compound.
[20:56.930 --> 20:59.930]  What is it?
[20:59.930 --> 21:02.930]  I went to the secret cup last year
[21:02.930 --> 21:05.930]  when they had it in Denver.
[21:05.930 --> 21:08.930]  I went with a couple of buddies of mine.
[21:08.930 --> 21:11.930]  That was right when I was first getting into
[21:11.930 --> 21:14.930]  making oil.
[21:14.930 --> 21:17.930]  More than every now and then.
[21:17.930 --> 21:20.930]  I was like,
[21:20.930 --> 21:23.930]  I'm going to make a lot of money.
[21:23.930 --> 21:26.930]  I'm going to make a lot of money.
[21:26.930 --> 21:29.930]  I remember telling everybody,
[21:29.930 --> 21:32.930]  we're going to win it.
[21:32.930 --> 21:35.930]  A year later,
[21:35.930 --> 21:38.930]  we snapped.
[21:38.930 --> 21:41.930]  I'm just trying not to say fucks and glitches.
[21:41.930 --> 21:44.930]  Every time I say it,
[21:44.930 --> 21:47.930]  I owe a dollar to a charity.
[21:47.930 --> 21:50.930]  I said we were going to win it.
[21:50.930 --> 21:53.930]  We came out and brought
[21:53.930 --> 21:56.930]  I think we came out real proper.
[21:56.930 --> 21:59.930]  A lot of the differences between us,
[21:59.930 --> 22:02.930]  which I don't speak for everybody,
[22:02.930 --> 22:05.930]  I don't know everybody that competed,
[22:05.930 --> 22:08.930]  we didn't have to source our product.
[22:08.930 --> 22:11.930]  We were able to pick it.
[22:11.930 --> 22:14.930]  I think that made a difference.
[22:14.930 --> 22:17.930]  Being able to pick certain flavors and knowing what you want.
[22:17.930 --> 22:20.930]  I would have hated to have to go source.
[22:20.930 --> 22:23.930]  I would have hated to have to find something that is good enough.
[22:23.930 --> 22:26.930]  I have a guy that comes straight to me for his secret material.
[22:26.930 --> 22:29.930]  He's always like,
[22:29.930 --> 22:32.930]  I need this crop at this time.
[22:32.930 --> 22:35.930]  You understand how it is.
[22:35.930 --> 22:38.930]  It's all about quality.
[22:38.930 --> 22:41.930]  I grow weed first before I make hash.
[22:41.930 --> 22:44.930]  It's a lot different when you spend 10 weeks with a plant
[22:44.930 --> 22:47.930]  and make hash instead of buying it off the shelf.
[22:47.930 --> 22:50.930]  It's a lot more full circle.
[22:50.930 --> 22:53.930]  Which is important to us.
[22:53.930 --> 22:56.930]  It's grown by us, processed by us.
[22:56.930 --> 22:59.930]  You took it from seed to live resin to a cup.
[22:59.930 --> 23:02.930]  That's super awesome.
[23:02.930 --> 23:05.930]  It's cool. It's been a fun experience.
[23:05.930 --> 23:08.930]  I don't know if it sank in.
[23:08.930 --> 23:11.930]  Honestly, I went in thinking I was going to have a top three finish.
[23:11.930 --> 23:14.930]  I'm just competitive. I hate losing.
[23:15.930 --> 23:18.930]  It was cool being able to go in.
[23:18.930 --> 23:21.930]  I almost thought I lost once they did all the awards.
[23:21.930 --> 23:24.930]  Then third and second, I was like, oh no, we didn't win.
[23:24.930 --> 23:27.930]  That's something I wanted to ask you.
[23:27.930 --> 23:30.930]  They did highest CBD, they did best herps, they did crowd choice.
[23:30.930 --> 23:33.930]  Connoisseur's choice.
[23:33.930 --> 23:36.930]  Then they do third, second.
[23:36.930 --> 23:39.930]  Then Big D said, so first place.
[23:39.930 --> 23:42.930]  He said something to the equivalent of, you guys already know who it is.
[23:43.930 --> 23:46.930]  I was like, oh, then it's probably somebody that's already gotten an award.
[23:46.930 --> 23:49.930]  That's what I assumed.
[23:49.930 --> 23:52.930]  Then he said garden.
[23:52.930 --> 23:55.930]  As soon as he said garden, I peed a little bit.
[23:55.930 --> 23:58.930]  He went through and did second place.
[23:58.930 --> 24:01.930]  It was the bubble.
[24:01.930 --> 24:04.930]  I wish the bubble was fire.
[24:04.930 --> 24:07.930]  I didn't even know it was bubbled at one.
[24:07.930 --> 24:10.930]  I looked at Maddie and I was like, we might not win.
[24:11.930 --> 24:14.930]  He did the announcement and it was tight.
[24:14.930 --> 24:17.930]  I wasn't thinking I was going to win.
[24:17.930 --> 24:20.930]  My speech was super short.
[24:20.930 --> 24:23.930]  To the point, I guess you could say.
[24:23.930 --> 24:26.930]  It was perfect.
[24:26.930 --> 24:29.930]  You said something about where you're from, this is illegal.
[24:29.930 --> 24:32.930]  It's great to be here with all these people making hash and celebrating.
[24:32.930 --> 24:35.930]  That's pretty awesome.
[24:35.930 --> 24:38.930]  You didn't know you were going to win?
[24:39.930 --> 24:42.930]  I thought I was going to win.
[24:42.930 --> 24:45.930]  It just came through.
[24:45.930 --> 24:48.930]  I think we put in everything we had into the competition.
[24:48.930 --> 24:51.930]  It paid off for us.
[24:51.930 --> 24:54.930]  Were there any other samples that stood out?
[24:54.930 --> 24:57.930]  There was a couple.
[24:57.930 --> 25:00.930]  Shout out to kind bill.
[25:00.930 --> 25:03.930]  Coming up with the live resin tech.
[25:03.930 --> 25:06.930]  Who made that?
[25:07.930 --> 25:10.930]  I think it was a guy named Bill.
[25:10.930 --> 25:13.930]  He came up with live resin.
[25:13.930 --> 25:16.930]  You beat that guy.
[25:16.930 --> 25:19.930]  There are some guys out here doing my same technique.
[25:19.930 --> 25:22.930]  They are killing it.
[25:22.930 --> 25:25.930]  He was regarding me.
[25:25.930 --> 25:28.930]  His was on point.
[25:28.930 --> 25:31.930]  It was sour D, deep chunk, and gorilla glue.
[25:31.930 --> 25:34.930]  It was really good.
[25:35.930 --> 25:38.930]  The glue and the sour are almost the same thing.
[25:38.930 --> 25:41.930]  The deep chunk is a sour diesel deep chunk.
[25:41.930 --> 25:44.930]  It's a purpley strain.
[25:44.930 --> 25:47.930]  If he would have done the sour D and the glue,
[25:47.930 --> 25:50.930]  it would have came out a whole lot better.
[25:50.930 --> 25:53.930]  In my opinion,
[25:53.930 --> 25:56.930]  the flavors would have pulled through.
[25:56.930 --> 25:59.930]  The sour with the gorilla glue.
[25:59.930 --> 26:02.930]  It's basically a purpley stain.
[26:03.930 --> 26:06.930]  The gorilla glue is a ridiculous plant.
[26:06.930 --> 26:09.930]  I have one growing right now.
[26:09.930 --> 26:12.930]  You have to tie it down.
[26:12.930 --> 26:15.930]  It will break the tie downs.
[26:15.930 --> 26:18.930]  I think it started with three tops.
[26:18.930 --> 26:21.930]  As it would grow,
[26:21.930 --> 26:24.930]  it would crop each top down.
[26:24.930 --> 26:27.930]  Now it has 18 tops.
[26:27.930 --> 26:30.930]  I have a 10 gallon gorilla glue that has 25 stakes.
[26:31.930 --> 26:34.930]  I think I have to take a plant out of the room.
[26:34.930 --> 26:37.930]  These two are taking more space than I predicted.
[26:37.930 --> 26:40.930]  I read who made it the other day.
[26:40.930 --> 26:43.930]  I read the cross too.
[26:43.930 --> 26:46.930]  I'm not surprised it's so killer.
[26:46.930 --> 26:49.930]  It's a sour D and chocolate tie.
[26:49.930 --> 26:52.930]  That's what made me think of it.
[26:52.930 --> 26:55.930]  I'm taking a dab.
[26:55.930 --> 26:58.930]  I'll give another shout out.
[26:59.930 --> 27:02.930]  I'm coming out from Cali.
[27:02.930 --> 27:05.930]  I'm coming to support the Colorado movement.
[27:05.930 --> 27:08.930]  Everybody who made the drive from Denver to the springs
[27:08.930 --> 27:11.930]  to go dab,
[27:11.930 --> 27:14.930]  that is so true.
[27:14.930 --> 27:17.930]  Not a lot of people can say let's go drive an hour down the street.
[27:17.930 --> 27:20.930]  Or down this beautiful state we live in.
[27:20.930 --> 27:23.930]  And go dab with all of our friends.
[27:23.930 --> 27:26.930]  Even the people we don't know.
[27:27.930 --> 27:30.930]  The best thing about our type of events is there's no rowdiness.
[27:30.930 --> 27:33.930]  There's no drunk people around getting mad.
[27:33.930 --> 27:36.930]  People hide and kicking it.
[27:36.930 --> 27:39.930]  Which is right down my alley.
[27:39.930 --> 27:42.930]  There's too much expensive glass around to get rowdy.
[27:42.930 --> 27:45.930]  Exactly.
[27:45.930 --> 27:48.930]  I'm not trying to pay for a $10,000 mothership rig.
[27:48.930 --> 27:51.930]  The award started and the PA system was kind of shitty.
[27:51.930 --> 27:54.930]  Nobody could hear.
[27:55.930 --> 27:58.930]  You had a Toro rig sitting on a table.
[27:58.930 --> 28:01.930]  A rig, a torch, and a piece of shatter.
[28:01.930 --> 28:04.930]  You left that shit.
[28:04.930 --> 28:07.930]  I left it.
[28:07.930 --> 28:10.930]  I found it there an hour later.
[28:10.930 --> 28:13.930]  Nobody touched it.
[28:13.930 --> 28:16.930]  It's good to know.
[28:16.930 --> 28:19.930]  You don't have to worry about things like that.
[28:19.930 --> 28:22.930]  You have a big box of prizes.
[28:23.930 --> 28:26.930]  It's a vector torch.
[28:26.930 --> 28:29.930]  It has a cup trophy on it.
[28:29.930 --> 28:32.930]  It has a gold dragon wrapped around it.
[28:32.930 --> 28:35.930]  It says secret cup on the back.
[28:35.930 --> 28:38.930]  Inside that cup it's filled with
[28:38.930 --> 28:41.930]  what looks like live.
[28:41.930 --> 28:44.930]  It's filled up with a bunch of oil.
[28:44.930 --> 28:47.930]  It was pretty sick.
[28:47.930 --> 28:50.930]  I got the torch.
[28:51.930 --> 28:54.930]  I got a rig from monsters glass company.
[28:54.930 --> 28:57.930]  Correct me if I'm wrong.
[28:57.930 --> 29:00.930]  It's a sick rig.
[29:00.930 --> 29:03.930]  It has a puppet flip disk in the bottom.
[29:03.930 --> 29:06.930]  It came with a matching pendant.
[29:06.930 --> 29:09.930]  It's huge.
[29:09.930 --> 29:12.930]  It's a dope pendant.
[29:12.930 --> 29:15.930]  What else did we get?
[29:15.930 --> 29:18.930]  There was a box of stuff.
[29:18.930 --> 29:21.930]  It's a toy box.
[29:21.930 --> 29:24.930]  It was in the rig.
[29:24.930 --> 29:27.930]  I got that from
[29:27.930 --> 29:30.930]  rocks.
[29:30.930 --> 29:33.930]  Shout out to you for that.
[29:33.930 --> 29:36.930]  My other email is going to be in the corner.
[29:36.930 --> 29:39.930]  It's getting dusty now.
[29:39.930 --> 29:42.930]  That prize box was huge.
[29:42.930 --> 29:45.930]  It was so much worth giving up.
[29:45.930 --> 29:48.930]  20 grams of live.
[29:48.930 --> 29:51.930]  I could keep that and smoke that for a while.
[29:51.930 --> 29:54.930]  It comes back worth it.
[29:54.930 --> 29:57.930]  You get to spend two days with an awesome community.
[29:57.930 --> 30:00.930]  With Maddie around.
[30:00.930 --> 30:03.930]  My lady smokes so much oil it's crazy.
[30:03.930 --> 30:06.930]  She has a
[30:06.930 --> 30:09.930]  I don't know.
[30:09.930 --> 30:12.930]  She gets high but then she will
[30:12.930 --> 30:15.930]  take another dab and get on high.
[30:15.930 --> 30:18.930]  She wants to take another dab.
[30:18.930 --> 30:21.930]  Now she's high again.
[30:21.930 --> 30:24.930]  It's cool.
[30:24.930 --> 30:27.930]  She can smoke all the oil she wants.
[30:27.930 --> 30:30.930]  Keep dabbing.
[30:30.930 --> 30:33.930]  That prize box was sweet.
[30:33.930 --> 30:36.930]  Now you get to go to Vegas.
[30:36.930 --> 30:39.930]  Is that the semifinals or the finals?
[30:39.930 --> 30:42.930]  I'm going to have to go to Vegas.
[30:42.930 --> 30:45.930]  I usually don't go to Vegas.
[30:45.930 --> 30:48.930]  That's how popular I am.
[30:48.930 --> 30:51.930]  You have to be back.
[30:51.930 --> 30:54.930]  We were talking about Vegas.
[30:54.930 --> 30:57.930]  We were looking into houses.
[30:57.930 --> 31:00.930]  Every house is nice.
[31:00.930 --> 31:03.930]  It's not Pueblo where there is only one street
[31:03.930 --> 31:06.930]  that has nice houses.
[31:06.930 --> 31:09.930]  We are looking into getting a house for a week.
[31:09.930 --> 31:12.930]  I don't know how long everyone will be there.
[31:12.930 --> 31:15.930]  If we are going to get it we will get it for a week.
[31:15.930 --> 31:18.930]  It sleeps 10 people.
[31:18.930 --> 31:21.930]  Every house has a pool and backyards.
[31:21.930 --> 31:24.930]  I might party one or two nights.
[31:24.930 --> 31:27.930]  Otherwise I'm going to kick it.
[31:27.930 --> 31:30.930]  Vegas I will lose too much money.
[31:30.930 --> 31:33.930]  I'm going to kick it.
[31:33.930 --> 31:36.930]  Vegas is expensive.
[31:36.930 --> 31:39.930]  You can get a six bedroom house for $900 a week.
[31:39.930 --> 31:42.930]  That's $75 a person.
[31:42.930 --> 31:45.930]  I'm Gucci with that.
[31:45.930 --> 31:48.930]  We can afford that.
[31:48.930 --> 31:51.930]  It's in December.
[31:51.930 --> 31:54.930]  What are the weed laws like in Vegas?
[31:54.930 --> 31:57.930]  That's stuff we will have to research.
[31:57.930 --> 32:00.930]  I'm not sure.
[32:00.930 --> 32:03.930]  I'm not trying to do that.
[32:03.930 --> 32:06.930]  I'm flying there.
[32:06.930 --> 32:09.930]  I'm not driving to Vegas.
[32:09.930 --> 32:12.930]  You have to drive through Utah.
[32:12.930 --> 32:15.930]  No, Arizona.
[32:15.930 --> 32:18.930]  Just get on a plane and an hour later you are in Vegas.
[32:18.930 --> 32:21.930]  I guess we are fine.
[32:21.930 --> 32:24.930]  Back to the point.
[32:24.930 --> 32:27.930]  I'm not sure.
[32:27.930 --> 32:30.930]  I guess we are fine.
[32:30.930 --> 32:33.930]  Get your tickets now.
[32:33.930 --> 32:36.930]  I have dogs.
[32:36.930 --> 32:39.930]  You will be gone for less time.
[32:39.930 --> 32:42.930]  You have all kinds of homies.
[32:42.930 --> 32:45.930]  All my homies want to go.
[32:45.930 --> 32:48.930]  We need somebody to take care of us.
[32:48.930 --> 32:51.930]  It's in December.
[32:51.930 --> 32:54.930]  Top three from every spot on the tour.
[32:55.930 --> 32:58.930]  It's a competition.
[32:58.930 --> 33:01.930]  The winner of that one is the champ?
[33:01.930 --> 33:04.930]  The gold WWF looking belt?
[33:04.930 --> 33:07.930]  I don't care.
[33:07.930 --> 33:10.930]  How many winners have there been before you?
[33:10.930 --> 33:13.930]  Mortimer won last year.
[33:13.930 --> 33:16.930]  Ryan Skipton was one year.
[33:16.930 --> 33:19.930]  Was there another year?
[33:19.930 --> 33:22.930]  I don't know.
[33:23.930 --> 33:26.930]  Shout out to the previous winners.
[33:26.930 --> 33:29.930]  What else have you won?
[33:29.930 --> 33:32.930]  You have been talking about this thing you do on Thursdays.
[33:32.930 --> 33:35.930]  Thursdays in Denver.
[33:35.930 --> 33:38.930]  They do a top shelf Thursday.
[33:38.930 --> 33:41.930]  Right now we are in the process of a
[33:41.930 --> 33:44.930]  special event.
[33:44.930 --> 33:47.930]  We are doing a special event.
[33:47.930 --> 33:50.930]  We are doing a special event.
[33:51.930 --> 33:54.930]  Right now we are in the process of a 16 person
[33:54.930 --> 33:57.930]  extract tournament.
[33:57.930 --> 34:00.930]  It's bracketed.
[34:00.930 --> 34:03.930]  I won my quarter finals on Thursday.
[34:03.930 --> 34:06.930]  I am now one of four.
[34:06.930 --> 34:09.930]  Did you enter the same material?
[34:09.930 --> 34:12.930]  No, I did the Cindy LaPugh.
[34:12.930 --> 34:15.930]  Killing it with different shit.
[34:16.930 --> 34:19.930]  I did the Cindy LaPugh times freedom baby.
[34:19.930 --> 34:22.930]  Awesome floral goodness.
[34:22.930 --> 34:25.930]  I did the green ribbon live sugar.
[34:25.930 --> 34:28.930]  I call it sugar.
[34:28.930 --> 34:31.930]  It's not like a butter.
[34:31.930 --> 34:34.930]  It's wet and pasty.
[34:34.930 --> 34:37.930]  It looks like bubble hash.
[34:37.930 --> 34:40.930]  It's awesome.
[34:40.930 --> 34:43.930]  I am into the semis.
[34:44.930 --> 34:47.930]  There are two more rounds to make the other side of the
[34:47.930 --> 34:50.930]  bracket.
[34:50.930 --> 34:53.930]  I think it's me and kind Bill.
[34:53.930 --> 34:56.930]  There are four other people fighting for the last two
[34:56.930 --> 34:59.930]  spots.
[34:59.930 --> 35:02.930]  It's pretty cool.
[35:02.930 --> 35:05.930]  I have won two of those and won the secret cup.
[35:05.930 --> 35:08.930]  You won the super bud bowl?
[35:08.930 --> 35:11.930]  I won second in the super bud bowl.
[35:12.930 --> 35:15.930]  Have you participated in any of those closet growers cup
[35:15.930 --> 35:18.930]  events?
[35:18.930 --> 35:21.930]  No, I always miss the events.
[35:21.930 --> 35:24.930]  It sucks because a lot of my stuff I grow.
[35:24.930 --> 35:27.930]  If it's not timed perfectly to where I can take stuff out of
[35:27.930 --> 35:30.930]  my garden, I usually don't enter.
[35:30.930 --> 35:33.930]  Now I have 10 weeks to get all the flavors I want to do for
[35:33.930 --> 35:36.930]  the cup ready to go.
[35:36.930 --> 35:39.930]  That's just enough time.
[35:40.930 --> 35:43.930]  It's perfect because I have the right amount of plants that are
[35:43.930 --> 35:46.930]  big enough.
[35:46.930 --> 35:49.930]  They are outgrowing their threes now.
[35:49.930 --> 35:52.930]  They are ready to go into 10s or so and finish from now to
[35:52.930 --> 35:55.930]  then.
[35:55.930 --> 35:58.930]  I will be able to pick what I want when I want it and which
[35:58.930 --> 36:01.930]  flavors we want to do.
[36:01.930 --> 36:04.930]  I get the privilege.
[36:04.930 --> 36:07.930]  Spence calls me up and says I just ran seven batches of live
[36:07.930 --> 36:10.930]  feed and I don't know what to enter.
[36:10.930 --> 36:13.930]  I go over there and they heat up the email and Maddie passes me
[36:13.930 --> 36:16.930]  dabs and they won't tell me what they are but they watch my
[36:16.930 --> 36:19.930]  reaction and I go, that one, bro.
[36:19.930 --> 36:22.930]  It was definitely a good experience being able to win
[36:22.930 --> 36:25.930]  something.
[36:25.930 --> 36:28.930]  It's good for, I'm not from Colorado.
[36:28.930 --> 36:31.930]  I moved here.
[36:31.930 --> 36:34.930]  It's cool because I called my parents and said I just won this
[36:35.930 --> 36:38.930]  hash competition.
[36:38.930 --> 36:41.930]  My mom was like, what?
[36:41.930 --> 36:44.930]  What does that mean?
[36:44.930 --> 36:47.930]  It's good to know I'm actually progressing and getting further
[36:47.930 --> 36:50.930]  into the scene.
[36:50.930 --> 36:53.930]  I guess the weed scene.
[36:53.930 --> 36:56.930]  It's cool being able to know that out of 38 people from
[36:56.930 --> 36:59.930]  Colorado or came to Colorado to enter hash, I had the best hash.
[36:59.930 --> 37:02.930]  That's not just 38 people.
[37:03.930 --> 37:06.930]  It's invite only.
[37:06.930 --> 37:09.930]  It's like Kumite of hash.
[37:09.930 --> 37:12.930]  You can't just show up.
[37:12.930 --> 37:15.930]  It was a private party.
[37:15.930 --> 37:18.930]  What's next for the garden of weed?
[37:18.930 --> 37:21.930]  Other than Vegas.
[37:21.930 --> 37:24.930]  Other than crushing Las Vegas and taking home the belt and
[37:24.930 --> 37:27.930]  bringing it to Pueblo, Colorado.
[37:27.930 --> 37:30.930]  To get it all dusty.
[37:31.930 --> 37:34.930]  I'm going to have to get a fake one.
[37:34.930 --> 37:37.930]  A dummy belt.
[37:37.930 --> 37:40.930]  I've been talking to some people.
[37:40.930 --> 37:43.930]  A lot of people I met traveling.
[37:43.930 --> 37:46.930]  Different networking stuff this year.
[37:46.930 --> 37:49.930]  I don't know.
[37:49.930 --> 37:52.930]  I want to travel to a couple of different places to let people
[37:52.930 --> 37:55.930]  experience live.
[37:55.930 --> 37:58.930]  Get people to show that they're not just a guy.
[37:59.930 --> 38:02.930]  There's another form of hash on the map.
[38:02.930 --> 38:05.930]  Take this to the other legal states.
[38:05.930 --> 38:08.930]  There's a couple of people I talk to through social media.
[38:08.930 --> 38:11.930]  Hopefully if it works out, it would be awesome.
[38:11.930 --> 38:14.930]  Who knows?
[38:14.930 --> 38:17.930]  We're just doing our thing.
[38:17.930 --> 38:20.930]  Especially here in Colorado.
[38:20.930 --> 38:23.930]  It's such a legal scene.
[38:23.930 --> 38:26.930]  You have to have money to get out of there.
[38:27.930 --> 38:30.930]  You have to have money to get a license and go that route.
[38:30.930 --> 38:33.930]  I'm just the guy that lives on this.
[38:33.930 --> 38:36.930]  It grows really good weed.
[38:36.930 --> 38:39.930]  One day there will be a business or something like that in our
[38:39.930 --> 38:42.930]  future.
[38:42.930 --> 38:45.930]  Right now we just like to grow pot and live in Colorado.
[38:45.930 --> 38:48.930]  It's better than living anywhere else.
[38:48.930 --> 38:51.930]  I agree to that.
[38:51.930 --> 38:54.930]  That's a great way to wrap up this interview with the champion.
[38:55.930 --> 38:58.930]  I'm calling you the champion already.
[38:58.930 --> 39:01.930]  You're the champion in my mind.
[39:01.930 --> 39:04.930]  I have faith in you.
[39:04.930 --> 39:07.930]  Thanks for coming to the show.
[39:07.930 --> 39:10.930]  Do you have anyone you want to give shout outs to?
[39:10.930 --> 39:13.930]  Shout out to my lady Maddie.
[39:13.930 --> 39:16.930]  Harvey Bain.
[39:16.930 --> 39:19.930]  Indica.
[39:19.930 --> 39:22.930]  Big Mike who's not here and he hates his life right now.
[39:23.930 --> 39:26.930]  I want to say on the phone.
[39:26.930 --> 39:29.930]  We talked about that.
[39:29.930 --> 39:32.930]  Broke his brand-new phone he just got a week ago.
[39:32.930 --> 39:35.930]  Shout out to everybody that supports our genetics.
[39:35.930 --> 39:38.930]  Garden of Weed.
[39:38.930 --> 39:41.930]  Anybody that's doing something positive.
[39:41.930 --> 39:44.930]  Shout out to you all.
[39:44.930 --> 39:47.930]  Big shout out to everybody that's growing their own.
[39:47.930 --> 39:50.930]  We're going to do Garden of Weeding's next show.
[39:51.930 --> 39:54.930]  We're going to do Garden of Weeding's going to be sponsoring
[39:54.930 --> 39:57.930]  an epilepsy fundraiser in Denver.
[39:57.930 --> 40:00.930]  End of November I think.
[40:00.930 --> 40:03.930]  I'll try to get some more information about that.
[40:03.930 --> 40:06.930]  It will be our first time actually going to an event like this.
[40:10.930 --> 40:13.930]  Being out in the more, not necessarily hippie crowd.
[40:13.930 --> 40:16.930]  Just being more in the medical side.
[40:16.930 --> 40:19.930]  Get out of the dad kid scene.
[40:20.930 --> 40:23.930]  Hang out with these kids.
[40:23.930 --> 40:26.930]  This stuff saves their lives.
[40:26.930 --> 40:29.930]  There's a kid, you've heard of team Landon.
[40:29.930 --> 40:32.930]  I got to meet a buddy of mine who makes all the oil for him.
[40:32.930 --> 40:35.930]  All the CBD stuff.
[40:35.930 --> 40:38.930]  His oil tested 40% CBD.
[40:41.930 --> 40:44.930]  It's cool because he knows that CBD is bad for you.
[40:44.930 --> 40:47.930]  He's a good guy.
[40:48.930 --> 40:51.930]  It's cool because he knows that the little kid will be like,
[40:51.930 --> 40:54.930]  or Landon will be like, mommy I need my cannabis.
[40:54.930 --> 40:57.930]  It makes me feel better.
[40:57.930 --> 41:00.930]  We're going to go out there and support the other side of being
[41:00.930 --> 41:03.930]  free in the cannabis industry.
[41:03.930 --> 41:06.930]  Being able to help people.
[41:06.930 --> 41:09.930]  It's cool for us giving back to people who need it.
[41:09.930 --> 41:12.930]  Got to pay it forward.
[41:12.930 --> 41:15.930]  The medicals are what started this for us.
[41:16.930 --> 41:19.930]  The people who need it for medical reasons,
[41:19.930 --> 41:22.930]  the people who don't need it for medical reasons wouldn't be
[41:22.930 --> 41:25.930]  smoking it.
[41:25.930 --> 41:28.930]  Legally at least.
[41:28.930 --> 41:31.930]  You got anything else?
[41:31.930 --> 41:34.930]  Thanks a lot for coming.
[41:34.930 --> 41:37.930]  We'll have you back.

[41:40.930 --> 41:43.930]  Are you full on Facebook yet?

[41:50.930 --> 41:53.930]  And check out the Garden of Weed N.
