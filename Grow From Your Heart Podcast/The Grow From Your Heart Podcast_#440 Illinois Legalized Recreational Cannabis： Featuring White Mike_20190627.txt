[00:00.000 --> 00:06.080]  Welcome back podcast world. It is time for episode 440 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.080 --> 00:09.840]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at Seeds Here Now. If you need
[00:09.840 --> 00:18.000]  new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Seeds Here Now and you can find them at seedsherenow.com.
[00:18.000 --> 00:21.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, White Mike is back on the show. Welcome to the show, buddy.
[00:21.080 --> 00:22.560]  Thanks, man. What's up, everybody?
[00:22.560 --> 00:26.640]  Thanks for joining us, dude. I know you were a busy guy, but we get a lot of requests to
[00:26.640 --> 00:27.760]  have you on the show.
[00:27.760 --> 00:31.280]  I've been hearing the shout outs. Keep sending them, people. I'll keep coming back.
[00:31.280 --> 00:34.800]  There you go. Keep requesting them. He will keep coming back on the show. We don't have
[00:34.800 --> 00:36.800]  him for a long time, so we're going to get into it.
[00:36.800 --> 00:38.160]  Yeah, it's been a minute. Let's dive right in.
[00:38.160 --> 00:41.280]  Yeah, it's been a little while, dude. Thanks for coming. Thanks for hanging out. We've
[00:41.280 --> 00:45.120]  been chatting for a few, so we got to jump into this. Where are we? Let's talk about
[00:45.120 --> 00:48.800]  what we're smoking on. Usually, we talk about what we're smoking. We just took a couple of
[00:49.760 --> 00:57.920]  GG No. 4 batter. The potency label says it is 65% THC with 75.1% total cannabinoids,
[00:57.920 --> 01:04.400]  but I topped that off with some pre-98 Bubba Kush high cannabinoid full spectrum extract.
[01:04.400 --> 01:12.720]  The potency label says this is 84.5% THC and 96.7% total cannabinoids. Basically,
[01:13.280 --> 01:18.000]  the batter looks... Would you agree that that looks like cheesecake or cake batter?
[01:18.000 --> 01:22.640]  The lids are on the wrong packages. That one right there, I would say cake batter or cheesecake.
[01:23.200 --> 01:24.560]  Then this one...
[01:24.560 --> 01:26.640]  Put the lids on the right containers as they go back.
[01:26.640 --> 01:31.040]  Yeah, that's a good idea. Then this one over here, would you say it looks like diamonds
[01:31.040 --> 01:38.160]  with hints of yellow? I've got some batter with some diamonds in it, basically. Those dabs were
[01:38.160 --> 01:45.760]  delicious. The GG 4, we're not supposed to say G, the other words, but the GG 4 tastes so good.
[01:45.840 --> 01:50.000]  Yeah, it tastes so good. It's got that earthy, cushy sort of a thing going on.
[01:50.000 --> 01:50.480]  And then that...
[01:50.480 --> 01:52.720]  The flavor on that combo dab was really nice.
[01:52.720 --> 01:56.000]  Yeah, the pre-98 just punches you right in the face. So big shout out to our friends.
[01:56.000 --> 01:59.040]  Both of those, of course, are from Apothecary Farms. So big shout out to our friends at
[01:59.040 --> 02:00.080]  Apothecary Farms.
[02:00.080 --> 02:00.960]  They do good work.
[02:00.960 --> 02:03.920]  They take good care of me over there. I've been shopping at the Pueblo location a lot
[02:03.920 --> 02:08.560]  since it is pretty close to our area here, and they see me on a regular basis. We have become
[02:08.560 --> 02:12.480]  quite friendly. So big shout out to all my friends. Go take care of your bud tenders at
[02:12.480 --> 02:13.520]  Apothecary Farms.
[02:14.480 --> 02:18.560]  All right, Mike. What is next? Oh, Patreon shout outs. That's what we usually do next.
[02:18.560 --> 02:21.840]  I've got to do some shout outs to our friends on Patreon.
[02:21.840 --> 02:25.200]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend, Miss Mel. Of course, a big Grow From Your Heart
[02:25.200 --> 02:28.720]  podcast shout out to our friends at Hogan's Farms. A big Grow From Your Heart podcast
[02:28.720 --> 02:34.640]  shout out to our buddy, Ryan S. Of course, a shout out to Aldridge. And as always, a big,
[02:34.640 --> 02:40.320]  giant Grow From Your Heart podcast hug and a shout out to my buddy, Stabby McStaverson.
[02:40.320 --> 02:44.160]  I want to thank everybody for all of the continued Patreon support. If you'd like to learn
[02:44.160 --> 02:50.320]  how to become a patron, you can do so by going to www.patreon.com
[02:50.320 --> 02:55.680]  slash growfromyourheart. All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[02:57.520 --> 03:00.640]  All right. We do have a couple of things to talk about on the podcast.
[03:00.640 --> 03:06.000]  Before we get to the main topic of the show, I do need to make a correction. There is a corrections
[03:06.000 --> 03:10.560]  department. Big shout out to the person who sent me the message reminding me that I fucked up. I
[03:10.560 --> 03:16.880]  said something wrong on the podcast. I'm all about being corrected. That's how I learn. Sometimes
[03:16.880 --> 03:22.000]  people are going to make mistakes. I did 440 episodes and I think this is the second or third
[03:22.000 --> 03:26.560]  correction I've received. If this is the fourth, I'm going to say that's still a good percentage.
[03:27.840 --> 03:32.480]  I'm going to make some mistakes and things are going to change. I apologize when that happens.
[03:33.440 --> 03:39.280]  I do my best to stay on top of it, but occasionally I talk fast. My brain goes really fast. Sometimes
[03:39.280 --> 03:43.600]  they don't connect properly. Sometimes the wrong numbers and letters will fly out. But I said
[03:43.600 --> 03:48.800]  something that was inaccurate and our corrections department sent me a message. If I do that again,
[03:48.800 --> 03:52.480]  please feel free to send me messages. I like learning. I like being corrected. That's how we
[03:52.480 --> 03:57.680]  stay smart and on top. The correction I need to make is on the last episode, I said that I only
[03:57.680 --> 04:03.920]  use products in Agro that are on the Colorado Department of Agriculture approved pesticide
[04:03.920 --> 04:13.280]  list for cannabis use. Then I listed Azimax. Azimax has been banned in the use of cannabis
[04:13.280 --> 04:18.480]  in Colorado medical and recreational production. When I said that, I was absolutely wrong.
[04:18.480 --> 04:23.360]  I'm correcting myself now. Do not use Azimax. You will get yourself in some trouble with the
[04:23.360 --> 04:29.680]  Department of Ag. I stand corrected. I apologize for that misinformation. I will do my best not to
[04:29.680 --> 04:33.760]  do that again. I promise you I'm not spraying Azimax anywhere. I've got another product.
[04:33.760 --> 04:36.640]  I can't think of it off the top of my head. I should have looked that up, but that's not what
[04:36.640 --> 04:41.040]  I was here for today. I just wanted to make sure that I did correct you that Azimax, or correct
[04:41.040 --> 04:47.040]  myself, that Azimax is no longer allowed in cannabis production. All right. We've made that
[04:47.040 --> 04:51.920]  correction. Let's move forward, Mike. You ready to jump into the main topic of today's podcast?
[04:51.920 --> 04:52.880]  Indeed.
[04:52.960 --> 04:56.560]  Indeed. The big news today, Illinois-
[04:57.200 --> 04:58.160]  Illinois.
[04:58.160 --> 05:00.800]  Illinois has gone recreational legal.
[05:00.800 --> 05:01.440]  Recreational.
[05:01.440 --> 05:05.760]  So now in Illinois, you can possess, I don't know all the rules, but you can have your cannabis.
[05:05.760 --> 05:06.640]  They have recreational cannabis.
[05:06.640 --> 05:08.480]  Not until January 1st.
[05:08.480 --> 05:11.360]  Okay. Well, yeah, you got to wait until the rules come into play. That's always the fun part.
[05:11.360 --> 05:16.080]  The bill was signed into law today. It landed on the governor's desk a couple of weeks ago
[05:16.720 --> 05:21.200]  and has been in that fun limbo while the governor decides or decides not to, or
[05:21.840 --> 05:27.120]  waits for the time they feel like signing to occur. Today was that day. It got signed this
[05:27.120 --> 05:27.520]  morning.
[05:27.520 --> 05:30.880]  Awesome. Well, thanks for signing it, sir, whose name I am not aware of.
[05:30.880 --> 05:32.320]  Governor Hard to Say's name.
[05:32.320 --> 05:35.920]  There you go. Governor Hard to Say. Thank you. That may be rude because I don't know what his
[05:35.920 --> 05:40.320]  name is. It feels like when you say that the bill has been, that we've basically been waiting for
[05:40.320 --> 05:45.280]  him to sign it, I get the feeling of when there's a movie coming out or a toy coming out when you
[05:45.280 --> 05:48.480]  were a kid and you wanted to go to that movie or you wanted that toy and you were just asking your
[05:48.800 --> 05:51.600]  mom, Hey, Friday, when this toy comes out, can I get it? Can I get it? Can I get it? And all week,
[05:51.600 --> 05:54.400]  she's like, I don't know, because she really didn't know. She didn't know if she could make
[05:54.400 --> 05:57.680]  that shit happen. Friday when payday came, she's going to pay up all the bills. And if there was
[05:57.680 --> 06:00.880]  six bucks left to go to that movie, you could, but she didn't want to tell you yes, because she'd
[06:00.880 --> 06:03.680]  break your fucking heart. She didn't want to tell you no now, because she might break your fucking
[06:03.680 --> 06:06.320]  heart. So she'd be like, I don't know. And all week you're just waiting.
[06:06.320 --> 06:12.400]  And so it's, it's a bizarre political thing. Like this is something that the governor in question,
[06:12.400 --> 06:16.560]  the governor of Illinois said he wanted, it was part of his campaign for reelection.
[06:17.280 --> 06:21.680]  Um, getting it done this year was a big platform of his, something he talked about
[06:21.680 --> 06:27.760]  wanting to accomplish, um, legalization efforts, especially in the legislatures this year took a
[06:27.760 --> 06:34.800]  weird turn where instead of just getting cannabis legal, we're trying to write like a whole bunch
[06:34.800 --> 06:41.760]  of the wrongs that have occurred over the prohibition years at the same time. And it's just
[06:42.160 --> 06:48.800]  too much at once. Like we want one-stop shopping here where we get weed legal and we get funding
[06:48.800 --> 06:56.400]  for communities that were way over policed for drug crimes and have suffered systemic problems
[06:56.400 --> 07:01.280]  because of that over policing. And we're going to get them some funding and we're going to make
[07:01.280 --> 07:06.240]  sure that there's a fund for minority business owners to become marijuana business owners to
[07:06.240 --> 07:10.000]  help them out with credit and stuff. And we're going to, if you sent that to me in an email,
[07:10.960 --> 07:13.440]  you know what I would reply with? Too long. I didn't read.
[07:13.440 --> 07:18.640]  It's yeah, it's, it's four or five different ideas all mushed together. They also got, um,
[07:20.640 --> 07:25.760]  fixing past convictions. If you were convicted of possession of less than, I want to say it's 30
[07:25.760 --> 07:30.640]  grams. I remember thinking it was an ounce and change. Um, if you had less than an ounce of
[07:30.640 --> 07:38.080]  change and you were busted in Illinois, you can now apply to have, uh, that conviction, uh, sealed
[07:38.080 --> 07:40.720]  or removed from your record. I'm not sure how they worded it, but you can get that expunged.
[07:40.720 --> 07:45.440]  I like that they gave you 30 grams in case you got it from me and I gave you a fat ounce,
[07:45.440 --> 07:51.680]  you know, you can have that extra 30, 31, 32 and not get in trouble because I never gave you 28.35.
[07:51.680 --> 08:00.320]  Also, I've mentioned that before, 28.35 an ounce is not 28 grams, an ounce is 28.35. That, that
[08:00.320 --> 08:04.400]  only, that doesn't sound big. That point. US listeners are a little surprised. The rest of
[08:04.400 --> 08:09.360]  the world is like fucking America, right? Yeah. Well, when that 0.35 doesn't sound like much,
[08:09.360 --> 08:15.040]  but add it up to four times, if you're buying a quarter pound, now you're at 0.7, that's 1.4,
[08:15.040 --> 08:20.880]  right? Then do the 16, then do that 16 ounces. And then do it 16 times. Yeah. Then what if you're
[08:20.880 --> 08:26.240]  buying 10 pounds? Like most people aren't, but we've got, yeah, that's what I was going to say.
[08:26.240 --> 08:30.880]  We've got a legal medical marijuana market. Now, if I say I sold them 10 pounds and you only ring
[08:30.880 --> 08:35.840]  up that 10 pounds by 28 grams and you actually gave, I gave them 28.35, there's going to be a
[08:35.840 --> 08:40.560]  shortage somewhere on our system and in our money. I got off way on a fucking crazy rant there. 30
[08:40.560 --> 08:46.480]  grams, bro. That's cool. The 30 grams thing. Don't get me wrong. I like all of the parts that they
[08:46.480 --> 08:52.160]  kind of squeezed into this law, but we watched New York and New Jersey fail in their attempts
[08:52.160 --> 08:57.360]  to get legalization done this year. Not because like a whole bunch of people there were like,
[08:57.360 --> 09:02.480]  maybe it's a bad idea. Let's hold off and see how it goes in the other place. None of that shit.
[09:02.480 --> 09:06.720]  They were all like, well, I want money for this pet project. And I think it's important that we
[09:06.720 --> 09:14.880]  address this particular wrong with this bill. And they could never hash out the taxes and the other
[09:14.880 --> 09:20.000]  stuff they wanted to attach to legalization. So they left it illegal for another eight months or
[09:20.000 --> 09:23.440]  in Texas for two more years because the legislature only meets every other year.
[09:23.760 --> 09:29.200]  But Illinois has managed to squeak it out just barely too. I think when this bill went through
[09:29.200 --> 09:33.040]  the Senate and their house of representatives, it only had a couple of days left in their official
[09:33.040 --> 09:38.160]  session. So it made it through just under the wire. And then governors do this weird thing
[09:38.160 --> 09:43.520]  where they campaign on something, the house passes it, the Senate passes it, it goes to
[09:43.520 --> 09:48.880]  the governor's desk. And then there's just three weeks wondering what the fuck's going on.
[09:48.880 --> 09:56.640]  Why do they play with us like that? There's not any rhyme or reason to it because all the
[09:56.640 --> 10:02.960]  governors do it and it happens pretty much anytime there's a bill signing, the bill heads to the
[10:02.960 --> 10:07.440]  governor's desk and you would expect like, Hey, this is a big thing you've been fucking talking
[10:07.440 --> 10:15.280]  about for a year. There was a big fight over at the press and you won. You official won on Friday.
[10:15.280 --> 10:19.360]  Why is Monday not like the everybody get together in my office and we'll sign this.
[10:21.040 --> 10:26.960]  It's always a couple of weeks down the road and then they don't announce it. So I've been waiting
[10:26.960 --> 10:31.280]  for the official, like, Hey, Illinois got signed to call you and say, Hey, we have to do a show.
[10:31.280 --> 10:37.280]  We should talk about Illinois. Perfect timing. And I've been watching, there's been no announcement
[10:37.280 --> 10:41.760]  saying, Hey, we're going to sign that sucker on Wednesday or nothing. It just, I got up today and
[10:41.760 --> 10:46.240]  I looked at my phone and was like, Oh, Hey, he signed it. Yeah. It was the day. It's weird.
[10:47.040 --> 10:50.320]  We don't pay attention to much of their stuff going on in Illinois because we are in Colorado.
[10:50.320 --> 10:53.920]  So no offense to Illinois. I just pay more attention to Colorado stuff. I wonder if he's
[10:53.920 --> 10:57.120]  just been going through a list signing shit or if today was just the day he's like, Oh,
[10:57.120 --> 11:02.640]  I should get on that. It's not like he was working on a to-do list and this was just item 25 and he
[11:02.640 --> 11:09.680]  couldn't get to it until he got item 24 done. It's there's nothing like that. Strange. Either way,
[11:09.680 --> 11:15.680]  shout out to our friends out there in Illinois for joining the recreational cannabis game.
[11:17.680 --> 11:22.880]  January 1st, everything really kicks off. If you're in Illinois or want to start a marijuana
[11:22.880 --> 11:29.040]  business in Illinois, now's the time to get on that shit. That brings us to 11 recreational
[11:29.040 --> 11:35.520]  cannabis States here in the great United States. 11. Yeah. Or if you're from Pueblo, that's 11,
[11:35.520 --> 11:42.400]  but most of the world says 11. So Colorado gets to claim to be first. Washington gets to claim
[11:42.400 --> 11:46.240]  to that. They went at the same time as us. Their polls just closed two hours after ours.
[11:48.160 --> 11:51.840]  And then every state census tried to come up with their own little claim to fame.
[11:51.840 --> 11:57.520]  Like Vermont got to say, like we legalized adult possession, but through the legislature,
[11:57.520 --> 12:00.800]  we're the first state to do it through the legislature, but they haven't gotten around
[12:00.800 --> 12:05.920]  to creating a commercial industry system. And so Illinois went through the legislature. They
[12:05.920 --> 12:10.560]  were the second to do through the legislature, but they're the first to do it through the
[12:10.560 --> 12:15.440]  legislature and include a retail system like framework for that. So they're like, Hey,
[12:15.440 --> 12:20.560]  we're first. And it's like 11th bitch. People are going to jump up and say that Colorado was not
[12:20.560 --> 12:25.200]  first. Oh, he said recreational. When it comes to medical, there are other States that were first.
[12:26.160 --> 12:32.560]  Big shout out to our friends, the Cali. And that is a good segue. 33 medical marijuana States here.
[12:32.560 --> 12:38.400]  If you guys can do math. 33 now. Yeah. That only leaves out six States without some cannabis
[12:38.400 --> 12:41.760]  friendly laws. Mike and I were trying to do some research, honestly, at the start of the show.
[12:42.320 --> 12:47.520]  And we kept finding conflicting information on which States do not support medical or some sort
[12:47.520 --> 12:52.960]  of cannabis. So many States at this point, I really think it's under five that
[12:53.760 --> 12:59.360]  don't have any sort of marijuana law, but now there's at least four or five on top of that
[12:59.360 --> 13:08.960]  original five that are CBD only where you can get basically hemp extract that up until the farm
[13:08.960 --> 13:16.480]  bill passed in November would have been considered totally illegal part of the marijuana plant.
[13:16.960 --> 13:25.120]  No different in a quarter law from high THC hash, but you can get CBD extract. And I think it's like
[13:25.120 --> 13:31.200]  Utah and a couple of others that are really minimal CBD only. We looked at a map and it had
[13:31.840 --> 13:37.120]  different shades of green would indicate recreational legal or decriminalized. And
[13:37.120 --> 13:42.320]  then little black States on the map would indicate don't go here. And most of those
[13:42.320 --> 13:47.920]  were down in the Southeastern part of our great nation here. So that's where we need to shift our
[13:47.920 --> 13:52.800]  focus on the cannabis legalization efforts. Most of us seem to be catching on here.
[13:52.800 --> 13:58.880]  It's coming in quick. Wisconsin is one of the States that has no medical marijuana laws,
[13:58.880 --> 14:04.720]  no recreational marijuana laws. And today they're elected officials, several of them were in the
[14:04.720 --> 14:10.560]  press talking about like, well, now we're kind of boxing in with Illinois going today.
[14:11.280 --> 14:16.400]  So Illinois is another big state. There's a shit ton of people that live in Illinois. I was going
[14:16.400 --> 14:20.480]  to Google exactly what their population is, but that seems like extra effort for tonight's show.
[14:20.480 --> 14:23.200]  Trey Lockerbies, MPH, Transcripts, and Sessions
[14:23.200 --> 14:24.160]  Preston Pysh, MPH, Transcripts, and Sessions
[14:24.160 --> 14:25.200]  Trey Lockerbies, MPH, Transcripts, and Sessions
[14:25.200 --> 14:26.560]  Preston Pysh, MPH, Transcripts, and Sessions
[14:26.560 --> 14:31.680]  State officials, people that decision makers on that level think like I do when they see...
[14:32.400 --> 14:36.880]  So I'm just going to say they were a square and the States to the North, the South, the East,
[14:36.880 --> 14:41.360]  and the West of us have all hypothetically just legalized some sort of cannabis use.
[14:42.240 --> 14:45.920]  Do you think that that makes us go, well, from an economic standpoint,
[14:45.920 --> 14:50.000]  we need to do this too, because all of our people are just driving 30 miles that way,
[14:50.000 --> 14:53.840]  30 miles that way, or 30 miles that way, or 110 miles that way. And they're buying product there
[14:53.840 --> 14:58.400]  and bringing it back. Maybe we need to just start... There's some of that.
[14:58.400 --> 15:03.040]  Do you think that works? I know for a fact, there are sections of
[15:03.040 --> 15:09.120]  Colorado that were thrilled that a couple of our neighboring States failed their legalization
[15:09.120 --> 15:18.400]  attempts because areas like Trinidad and Southern Colorado have been really energized by legal
[15:18.400 --> 15:25.360]  cannabis taxes and revenue investment in the community. Trinidad's a weird city that's gone
[15:25.360 --> 15:31.920]  through several boom and bust cycles. And even their sheriff is like, hey, ride the boom while
[15:31.920 --> 15:36.720]  it's booming. These guys aren't hurting anybody. They're investing a ton of taxes into our little
[15:36.720 --> 15:40.480]  area. It's great for us. We have friends down there. We used to go to gatherings down there,
[15:40.480 --> 15:45.280]  and we've seen that place go from a dusty, kind of a fallen apart town. It was almost a ghost town.
[15:45.280 --> 15:47.920]  It was. And now it's beautiful. It's strange to say, but it's pretty now.
[15:47.920 --> 15:53.360]  It was five or 10 years from ghost town. And now it's a hustling little city.
[15:53.360 --> 15:58.240]  And Trinidad is basically the first city in Colorado when you come from New Mexico,
[15:58.240 --> 16:04.160]  if you're coming North from New Mexico, which is a good segue to talk about this part. I stay a lot
[16:04.160 --> 16:08.080]  on top of what's happening in New Mexico. I'm involved in the New Mexico medical marijuana
[16:08.080 --> 16:12.480]  movement as also, and also what is going to become the recreational medical marijuana movement. I do
[16:13.120 --> 16:18.240]  some consulting and things like that. I help people down there do some teaching and other things, but
[16:18.240 --> 16:23.280]  I pay attention to what's going on down there. A big part of why they are pushing toward the
[16:23.280 --> 16:28.640]  legalization of recreational cannabis is because they see many people post openly about it on
[16:28.640 --> 16:34.640]  Facebook, anywhere, in the groups, wherever we talk on social media. They're like, I don't even
[16:34.640 --> 16:38.320]  shop in New Mexico. I go to Colorado because it's half the price. And so they're showing pictures of
[16:38.320 --> 16:42.400]  all this Colorado product in New Mexico. And so New Mexico is saying, well, fuck, they're just
[16:42.400 --> 16:46.720]  driving two hours. It's all they have to do. And it's half the price and double the quality because
[16:46.720 --> 16:50.640]  we have silly rules here. Let's change that. And that's actually part of why they're changing their
[16:50.640 --> 16:54.800]  rules. It's got a small influence. I can't say it's a big deal, but it does affect them. They've
[16:54.800 --> 17:02.560]  noticed it. There was a huge influx of, they call it tourism traffic through Colorado, starting
[17:03.440 --> 17:09.440]  January, 2014, as soon as our rec stores opened. There was no reason to come visit us with med
[17:09.440 --> 17:14.080]  stores really. I mean, you could, but you weren't. You couldn't get in. Who wants to go stand in the
[17:14.080 --> 17:22.880]  parking lot at Disneyland or Wally World or whatever. But with rec, people from all around
[17:22.880 --> 17:28.400]  the US, I mean, all over the planet, really. When I was budgeting in it, one of the more touristy
[17:28.400 --> 17:34.400]  spots in town, we would get people from all over the planet regularly. I can remember a couple of
[17:34.400 --> 17:42.000]  guys from Ireland who I spent like an hour walking around and taking pictures of, I mean, everything
[17:42.000 --> 17:46.480]  in the dispensary just blown away because there's nothing like this where they're from. It's not
[17:46.480 --> 17:53.760]  going to be for another 30 years. Just watching us, Canada did this exactly. Canada saw some of
[17:53.760 --> 17:59.360]  our states going legal and that really pushed their government. I mean, really, really pushed.
[17:59.360 --> 18:04.880]  They've been more adult about their marijuana discussion, I'd say for the last 20 years.
[18:05.680 --> 18:10.960]  But watching states in the US go legal and then having Canadians report like,
[18:10.960 --> 18:16.080]  we just jumped the border to Washington, grab what we want and bring it back. No one checks
[18:16.080 --> 18:25.600]  our cars. Who smokes shit from the US into Canada? Canada jumped on it. Mexico's talking
[18:25.600 --> 18:32.080]  about it right now. When Mexico goes legal, that's huge. That's going to change the game
[18:32.080 --> 18:37.200]  completely. If the feds here haven't made a move on legalization when Mexico goes, they'll have to.
[18:37.760 --> 18:43.680]  Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, that'll cause all kinds of weird, probably all kinds of international
[18:43.680 --> 18:47.840]  rule stuff. Not really. There's all kinds of shit that's legal in Mexico and Canada
[18:47.840 --> 18:53.600]  that ain't legal here. Like cigars for one thing from Cuba. I think those may,
[18:54.480 --> 18:57.680]  if I heard correctly, we lifted that. I don't know what's happening there. I don't pay enough
[18:57.680 --> 19:00.800]  attention to that. You did give me a good opportunity for a good segue. I want to throw
[19:00.800 --> 19:06.400]  it out before I forget it. We've talked about the 11 rec states, the 33 medical marijuana states.
[19:06.400 --> 19:10.160]  We talked some trash about those punk-ass states that haven't caught on yet. Get it together,
[19:10.160 --> 19:16.880]  boys and girls. Let's get some cannabis-friendly happening in your states. Do you know of any
[19:16.880 --> 19:21.520]  places where would be, in your opinion, the worst cannabis laws? They don't have to be in the United
[19:21.520 --> 19:27.120]  States. Where would you not want to be caught with cannabis? There's a bunch of places in Asia where,
[19:27.920 --> 19:35.520]  I remember reading a story, dude had a little bit of a nug that fell off his lap when he was
[19:35.520 --> 19:40.160]  rolling a joint, something that fell out of the end of the joint and got stuck in his shoe and was
[19:40.160 --> 19:49.280]  doing time in Egypt for it or some shit. He got caught at the airport. US, Texas has always had
[19:49.280 --> 19:56.960]  particularly horrible marijuana laws, especially in regards to concentrates. If you got caught with
[19:56.960 --> 20:02.320]  hash, they would charge you as though it was heroin, like, wait till late. I have an acquaintance who
[20:02.320 --> 20:07.680]  was caught with one of these containers in Texas. This container I'm picking up-
[20:07.680 --> 20:09.440]  It's just a gram container hash.
[20:09.440 --> 20:13.600]  Inside is a gram container. I'm going to drop this container on the table. I'm going to turn
[20:13.600 --> 20:16.480]  the mic toward the table and then I'm going to drop this on the table so you can hear how much
[20:16.480 --> 20:20.320]  this container weighs. It's a heavy glass container.
[20:20.320 --> 20:22.000]  That's heavy. Yeah, that's a lot of weight to that glass.
[20:22.000 --> 20:23.040]  It's like a baby food jar.
[20:23.040 --> 20:27.040]  When they busted him in Texas, you know what they did? They charged him for the weight of the
[20:27.040 --> 20:32.560]  container. However much you just heard hit the table, they think he had that much concentrate
[20:32.560 --> 20:36.640]  on him when he had less than a gram because honestly he'd been consuming it. It was probably
[20:36.640 --> 20:41.520]  three quarters, maybe a half, knowing this dude by the time he got to Texas. They charged him with
[20:41.520 --> 20:44.000]  that full weight of that container.
[20:44.000 --> 20:51.280]  There was a case that I'm pretty sure I mentioned it on the show at the time where a dude bought
[20:51.280 --> 20:59.200]  two grams of Cheddar, so just two grams of hash and baked each gram into a tray of brownies.
[20:59.200 --> 21:05.520]  He had two trays of brownies. They weighed the tray that the brownies were in and the brownies
[21:06.240 --> 21:12.480]  and then charged this kid in court as though he had that weight worth of heroin.
[21:13.920 --> 21:20.240]  This kid was looking at 40 years in prison for making two trays of brownies because he
[21:20.240 --> 21:26.160]  used hash to make them. Then they weigh everything because they could have charged
[21:26.160 --> 21:31.600]  him with two grams of marijuana concentrate, but under Texas law, they get to weigh the
[21:31.600 --> 21:35.920]  fucking brownies. They get to weigh the container the brownies are in and then they get to call it
[21:35.920 --> 21:40.800]  heroin at your trial. You had a hard narcotic, a schedule one narcotic.
[21:40.800 --> 21:43.520]  Schedule, yeah. Jeez, that's miserable.
[21:44.480 --> 21:50.480]  Utah, I hate on a number of principles. Sorry if you're a Utah lover.
[21:50.480 --> 21:53.040]  Notice I haven't thrown out any hatred for any places yet.
[21:53.040 --> 21:53.440]  But-
[21:53.440 --> 21:54.080]  Trying to travel.
[21:54.640 --> 21:59.360]  Utah's marijuana laws have always been exceptionally harsh, so has Oklahoma's.
[22:00.400 --> 22:02.000]  I remember Macaulay Culkin got busted-
[22:02.000 --> 22:02.960]  Oklahoma's killing it now.
[22:02.960 --> 22:07.600]  ... in Oklahoma with a quarter and they were talking about sending Macaulay Culkin
[22:07.600 --> 22:09.040]  to jail for 15 years.
[22:09.040 --> 22:12.320]  That was, yeah, several years ago, but now Oklahoma's on top of shit.
[22:12.320 --> 22:14.560]  They've got a nice medical program going now.
[22:14.560 --> 22:18.800]  Now Oklahoma's kind of like the new Colorado. If you are trying to start a cannabis business,
[22:18.800 --> 22:21.440]  if you've got something going on, if you've got commercial grow experience,
[22:21.440 --> 22:24.320]  you're hot in Oklahoma right now. That is a place to be. Yeah.
[22:25.040 --> 22:29.520]  There are stories from, I'm from, I've got some background in the music industry. I don't want
[22:29.520 --> 22:32.720]  to try to sound like some fucking music guru or something, but I've done some stuff in the
[22:32.720 --> 22:37.200]  music industry. Excuse that throat stuff there, I'll fix that. I've done some stuff in the music
[22:37.200 --> 22:41.520]  industry. And when you travel out of the States, one of the things that comes in this little
[22:41.520 --> 22:45.840]  pamphlet that a lot of the record companies and touring companies will give you says that they
[22:45.840 --> 22:52.000]  recommend you buy new shoes and new clothing before you travel to places like Dubai and Egypt
[22:52.000 --> 22:57.760]  and like anywhere in Asia or the Middle East because they scan you. And if they find,
[22:57.760 --> 23:02.400]  they say not to wear, they say to go to the airport in one pair of shoes and carry another
[23:02.400 --> 23:06.560]  pair of shoes in the box and never wear them and ditch those before you get on the plane.
[23:06.560 --> 23:10.240]  And then put on your new or ditch the old ones as you get on the plane to put on your new shoes
[23:10.240 --> 23:14.480]  and fly in those and travel into the country in your new shoes because they'll scan your shoes.
[23:14.480 --> 23:20.640]  And if you've walked through something with drugs on it, they will detect. And I'm doing air quotes.
[23:22.000 --> 23:27.200]  There's at least one Asian country where they're regularly executing, like beheading.
[23:28.320 --> 23:30.800]  Like Kuwait will behead you, I think. They say drug traffickers,
[23:31.920 --> 23:39.120]  but it's anybody caught with more than a tiny amount of drugs. They're doing the same shit
[23:39.120 --> 23:44.800]  they used to do here where if you go buy a quarter ounce of weed, your guy throws you two
[23:44.800 --> 23:53.280]  bags that are 3.5 grams each. You didn't just buy a quarter according to law enforcement. You have
[23:53.280 --> 23:59.760]  seven grams ready for distribution. Wow. I've got a gram of pre-98 Bubba Kush. I've got a gram of
[23:59.760 --> 24:03.520]  GG4. I've got a gram of Star Cookies. I'm not trying to list names here. I'm just saying that
[24:03.520 --> 24:07.440]  I've got multiple grams, but since I chose to buy multiple flavors- Depending on where you are,
[24:07.520 --> 24:13.200]  because it's not all mushed together in the bottom of a jar or a baggie, it's ready for
[24:13.200 --> 24:19.600]  distribution. No, sir. These are different flavors. I heard a cop say, they think that all these
[24:19.600 --> 24:23.120]  different plants do different things to them. It all just makes them stupid. I've heard a cop say
[24:23.120 --> 24:29.760]  that and I was like, geez. All right. Good support officer. The level of ignorance around cannabis
[24:29.760 --> 24:34.880]  and why it's so effective on so many different things is just astounding. We're fixing that.
[24:34.880 --> 24:37.040]  We're doing our part to fix that. We're- Little by little, it's getting better.
[24:37.040 --> 24:41.440]  Dispelling all the bullshit one episode at a time. Thanks for helping us do that, dude.
[24:41.440 --> 24:42.960]  I'm trying, man. I'm trying.
[24:42.960 --> 24:46.480]  You're doing your part out there. We haven't given you a shout out on your social media. Would you
[24:46.480 --> 24:50.480]  like people to follow your Facebook page? Sure. You can check me out on Twitter at
[24:50.480 --> 24:54.880]  at Nemopunk15 or on Facebook at Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[24:54.880 --> 24:58.160]  There you go. Give Mike a follow because he is a cannabis advocate, a spokesperson,
[24:58.160 --> 25:01.600]  and a warrior. We need to give him some support. Give him some clicks and follows. Let him know
[25:01.600 --> 25:05.680]  you found him on the podcast, too. It's nice to know where your clicks and follows are coming from.
[25:05.680 --> 25:09.040]  Yep. I haven't been inspired to write much lately. Hit me up,
[25:09.840 --> 25:12.240]  send me some social media love and maybe I'll get writing again.
[25:12.240 --> 25:17.520]  Trigger him. Get him going. I started to... It felt less like arguing and
[25:17.520 --> 25:23.040]  it kind of felt like I was the dude clubbing baby seals to death for a minute. They needed it.
[25:23.040 --> 25:26.800]  The average intelligence on the internet is not impressive.
[25:26.800 --> 25:28.000]  No. So when you go in,
[25:28.000 --> 25:31.760]  if you've done two minutes of research, you already look smarter than 99.9%
[25:33.440 --> 25:39.200]  of the people in opposition of your idea. It's mostly an echo chamber. If you go in and you
[25:39.200 --> 25:43.520]  break up the echo chamber, you already look like you're fucking some sort of elite something already.
[25:46.720 --> 25:53.760]  The anti-pot crowd's fucking bad at everything. When the first three paragraphs of my response
[25:53.760 --> 25:58.960]  are correcting words they've used majorly incorrectly, it's like, no, you didn't mean
[25:58.960 --> 26:03.920]  school bus, dude. You meant sneakers. Oh man. Well, there are only six states left,
[26:03.920 --> 26:05.840]  so obviously they're not doing too well. It just feels like you're punching down
[26:05.840 --> 26:08.560]  when you got to start off like that. So I took a little break.
[26:08.560 --> 26:12.160]  I'm slowed down on my social media and my social media trolling, and it does make a
[26:12.160 --> 26:15.600]  difference in your life. Guys, put down the computer and the phone and all that for a minute.
[26:15.600 --> 26:18.240]  And that's coming from a guy who is constantly using me on social media.
[26:18.240 --> 26:20.720]  There's like 11 screens pointed at Jeff right now.
[26:21.040 --> 26:24.560]  But we're running a show here. This one's got show notes, bro. That one's for you so that you know
[26:24.560 --> 26:28.560]  where the hell we're going. This one's making the show happen. So without these, man, it's dark.
[26:28.560 --> 26:32.160]  Indubitably. Yeah. I'm going to use that word more often. Hey, Mike, thanks for joining us.
[26:33.200 --> 26:37.840]  Let's start wrapping up this podcast. I think we should. It feels like the right time to do that.
[26:37.840 --> 26:42.080]  It does. It does. It feels good. Make sure- Congratulations, Illinois, before we-
[26:42.080 --> 26:45.040]  Oh yeah. Before we move to the outro.
[26:45.040 --> 26:48.400]  Big shout out to Governor Hard to say and all of our friends out there in Illinois.
[26:48.480 --> 26:52.800]  I could Google his name for a minute, but it's got some weird letters mashed together in the front,
[26:52.800 --> 26:57.920]  and I'm bad at that. I bet only the people from Illinois care what his name is.
[26:57.920 --> 27:00.240]  Yeah, that's- 80% of them are going, yeah,
[27:00.240 --> 27:03.440]  hard to say. It's good enough for us. Yep. Governor Hard to say. But we really
[27:03.440 --> 27:08.240]  appreciate the marijuana legalization effort this month or this year, Illinois. We needed that win.
[27:08.240 --> 27:13.520]  And so good on you. Yes. Yes. Good on you. Hey, I look forward to seeing everybody at the
[27:13.520 --> 27:20.720]  Dude Grows 710 Concentration Celebration on 713 at Cultivated Synergy. It'll be an educational
[27:20.720 --> 27:24.400]  event. We will talk a lot about concentrations. It'll be a good time. The Dude Grows crew will
[27:24.400 --> 27:28.240]  be there. The dude probably will not be there. He's got another event. I think it's his wife's
[27:28.240 --> 27:33.520]  birthday, so he's got to attend that. But Scotty Real will be there. Guru will be there. I,
[27:33.520 --> 27:39.040]  myself, will be there. I am also bringing my side piece. Deb and Granny will be there.
[27:39.040 --> 27:43.600]  She's also bringing Grumpy Grandpa. They will be there. They will be hanging out at the Iry
[27:43.600 --> 27:48.160]  Genetics booth. Make sure you come by the booth. Say hi. Come check out some of the new packaging

[28:56.960 --> 29:00.400]  and you would like to reach out, maybe you've got a question, maybe you've got something you'd like
[29:00.400 --> 29:04.400]  to say, maybe you've got a correction to make, maybe you'd like to sponsor the podcast, perhaps
[29:04.400 --> 29:09.120]  you've got a product you'd like Mike and I to review, you can send me an old-fashioned email.
[29:09.120 --> 29:14.320]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com. You know that I would love to hear from you.
[29:14.320 --> 29:18.080]  Mike, remember when old-fashioned meant you wrote a letter and folded it up and put an envelope and
[29:18.080 --> 29:25.200]  put a stamp on it? I just said old-fashioned email. Yeah, we're old now, bro. Somebody told
[29:25.200 --> 29:30.720]  me my gray hair looks like I paid someone to highlight it that way. It was the compliment of
[29:30.720 --> 29:36.160]  last week. It's a little grayer every episode, buddy. It's a little grayer every episode.
[29:36.160 --> 29:40.800]  Kids, man. Both of them. All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank Mike once again for
[29:40.800 --> 29:44.720]  coming and hanging out for a good podcast. This is a great show, buddy. Yeah, good to be back.
[29:44.720 --> 29:48.320]  I want to thank everybody for listening to another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast. I'll
[29:48.320 --> 29:52.480]  be back Monday with fresh new content. I want to give a huge shout out to Deb and Granny.
[29:52.480 --> 29:56.000]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
