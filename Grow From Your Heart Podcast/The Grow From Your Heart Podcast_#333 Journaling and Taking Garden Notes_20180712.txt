[00:08.840 --> 00:10.560]  news, education, and conversation.
[00:10.560 --> 00:11.560]  That's right.
[00:11.560 --> 00:15.680]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
[00:15.680 --> 00:19.680]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who is just curious about the current

[00:23.240 --> 00:24.240]  I'm your host.
[00:24.240 --> 00:25.520]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:25.520 --> 00:28.640]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.

[00:44.600 --> 00:54.480]  dab rig because it's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:54.480 --> 00:55.480]  What's up, internet world?
[00:55.480 --> 00:58.280]  It's time for episode 333 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:58.280 --> 00:59.720]  Thanks again for joining me.
[00:59.720 --> 01:03.320]  This episode of the podcast is brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[01:03.320 --> 01:06.920]  If you need new regular or feminized seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella
[01:06.920 --> 01:08.360]  Dank Seed Company.
[01:08.360 --> 01:12.280]  You can find them at dankseed.store.
[01:12.280 --> 01:15.240]  You guys know I like to start these podcasts off by letting you know what I've been dabbing
[01:15.240 --> 01:16.240]  on.
[01:16.240 --> 01:20.400]  Today, it is 710, so I've been dabbing on a little bit of everything.
[01:20.400 --> 01:23.840]  I started off with some East Coast Strawberries Ambrosia.
[01:23.840 --> 01:26.060]  I had a little bit of Holy Grail batter.
[01:26.060 --> 01:29.080]  I've had some Durban Kush sauce.
[01:29.440 --> 01:34.840]  Now, I'm dabbing some Clementine Ambrosia sauce with gigantic crystals, gigantic chunks
[01:34.840 --> 01:35.840]  in here.
[01:35.840 --> 01:40.320]  It just smells like a big bag of fresh clementines or some orange candies.
[01:40.320 --> 01:42.860]  It's got a really juicy, wet smell to it.
[01:42.860 --> 01:44.120]  It smells amazing.
[01:44.120 --> 01:46.920]  You can smell it from several inches away from your face.
[01:46.920 --> 01:48.160]  This jar is quite turpy.
[01:48.160 --> 01:49.840]  It's a nice-sized jar.
[01:49.840 --> 01:52.760]  It smells delicious, and the dabs just taste incredible.
[01:52.760 --> 01:54.660]  The flavor doesn't go away.
[01:54.660 --> 01:57.760]  When you take a dab of the Clementine, you can take a drink of water five or ten minutes
[01:57.760 --> 02:01.100]  later, and it kind of reactivates the Clementine flavor in your mouth.
[02:01.100 --> 02:02.880]  It is delicious.
[02:02.880 --> 02:04.040]  So that's my 710.
[02:04.040 --> 02:05.040]  That's what I'm dabbing on.
[02:05.040 --> 02:09.760]  I hope you guys had a great, safe 710, and I also hope you enjoyed this 710 episode of
[02:09.760 --> 02:10.760]  the podcast.
[02:10.760 --> 02:14.640]  If you haven't checked that out, go back and listen to the last episode and learn all about
[02:14.640 --> 02:15.640]  710.
[02:15.640 --> 02:20.240]  All right, speaking of 710, there were some celebrations happening here in Colorado.
[02:20.240 --> 02:25.200]  On Saturday, I was lucky enough to attend the Elevate Oil Spill and Chill Party.
[02:25.200 --> 02:28.280]  Our friends at Elevate Glass in Colorado Springs hosted a party.
[02:28.280 --> 02:31.200]  They have a beautiful glass shop with some great glass in there.
[02:31.200 --> 02:34.840]  If you need a new rig, a new pipe, a new bong, or a new smoking accessory, and you're in
[02:34.840 --> 02:39.060]  Colorado Springs, I suggest Elevate at 517 South Tejon.
[02:39.060 --> 02:40.060]  Make sure you check them out.
[02:40.060 --> 02:43.020]  They've got great glass, great prices, great customer service.
[02:43.020 --> 02:44.140]  They threw a party.
[02:44.140 --> 02:48.580]  The store was packed with great sales and great deals, and also in the back of the building,
[02:48.580 --> 02:51.140]  they had several booths with great vendors.
[02:51.140 --> 02:52.480]  They had fire spinners.
[02:52.480 --> 02:53.620]  There was a DJ.
[02:53.620 --> 02:55.300]  There was live painting.
[02:55.300 --> 02:56.940]  There were plenty of games to play.
[02:56.940 --> 02:58.660]  There was a giant Jenga game.
[02:58.660 --> 03:00.620]  There was a giant Connect Four.
[03:00.620 --> 03:02.440]  There were folks playing cornhole.
[03:02.440 --> 03:03.440]  It was a great party.
[03:03.440 --> 03:06.460]  There was a little dab tent where you could hang out and take some dabs.
[03:06.460 --> 03:09.060]  The folks from Elevate were showing off a bunch of their new products.
[03:09.060 --> 03:11.460]  It was a really well-organized event.
[03:11.460 --> 03:13.540]  I got to see a bunch of great people.
[03:13.540 --> 03:16.660]  Elevate gave away a bunch of great prizes, and I had a great time.
[03:16.660 --> 03:17.860]  Big shout out to Becca.
[03:17.860 --> 03:19.860]  Big shout out to the entire Elevate crew.
[03:19.860 --> 03:21.660]  Thanks for a great party.
[03:21.660 --> 03:22.660]  That was Saturday.
[03:22.700 --> 03:25.980]  Then Sunday was Ambrosia Days at Apothecary.
[03:25.980 --> 03:28.700]  Apothecary is a dispensary in Colorado Springs.
[03:28.700 --> 03:30.700]  It's Apothecary Farms.
[03:30.700 --> 03:33.900]  They host an event called Ambrosia Days.
[03:33.900 --> 03:35.700]  Apothecary is known for their concentrates.
[03:35.700 --> 03:37.740]  They don't carry any flour in their dispensary.
[03:37.740 --> 03:40.300]  They carry concentrates, several different styles.
[03:40.300 --> 03:41.300]  They've got their Ambrosia.
[03:41.300 --> 03:42.380]  They've got batter.
[03:42.380 --> 03:43.180]  They've got shatter.
[03:43.180 --> 03:44.380]  They've got waxes.
[03:44.380 --> 03:46.460]  You can get HCFSE.
[03:46.460 --> 03:47.980]  You can get the HTFSE.
[03:47.980 --> 03:49.860]  You can get sauce.
[03:49.860 --> 03:50.780]  You can get pucks.
[03:50.780 --> 03:51.660]  You can get diamonds.
[03:51.660 --> 03:53.660]  They've got all kinds of different concentrates.
[03:53.660 --> 03:55.420]  They've got a few edibles available.
[03:55.420 --> 03:57.700]  They have a few vape pen cartridges.
[03:57.700 --> 04:01.020]  They have turpins available, but they don't carry any flowers.
[04:01.020 --> 04:03.500]  So it's a very quick shopping experience.
[04:03.500 --> 04:05.900]  They have a bunch of concentrates to show you.
[04:05.900 --> 04:07.500]  Everything is all in one little display,
[04:07.500 --> 04:09.100]  so you can check it out really quickly.
[04:09.100 --> 04:11.500]  Anyway, they have their Ambrosia Days party,
[04:11.500 --> 04:14.580]  where they have everything on sale for amazingly low prices.
[04:14.580 --> 04:16.260]  They save up a bunch of great inventory,
[04:16.260 --> 04:18.860]  and they release a bunch of great products on those days.
[04:18.860 --> 04:20.620]  They have their specials and their rare releases
[04:20.620 --> 04:22.300]  on those Ambrosia Days.
[04:22.300 --> 04:25.260]  Then they throw a party at another place off-site.
[04:25.260 --> 04:28.100]  This time the party was at a place called Vibe.
[04:28.100 --> 04:30.500]  I was able to do some shopping.
[04:30.500 --> 04:32.540]  Then I had to go run some errands in Colorado Springs,
[04:32.540 --> 04:33.740]  had to go hit the Guitar Center
[04:33.740 --> 04:34.780]  and spend a bunch of money there.
[04:34.780 --> 04:36.300]  That's one of my favorite things to do.
[04:36.300 --> 04:38.540]  Then I got to go over to the Ambrosia Days party
[04:38.540 --> 04:39.580]  and link up with some friends.
[04:39.580 --> 04:42.140]  That was a good time, because as soon as I got out of the car,
[04:42.140 --> 04:44.460]  I ran into our buddy, Miho Dabin.
[04:44.460 --> 04:46.780]  Ran into all of the New Mexico crew.
[04:46.780 --> 04:48.420]  What up, Huggy Duggy?
[04:48.420 --> 04:49.780]  What up, Deez and the whole crew?
[04:49.780 --> 04:50.700]  I'm not gonna list all you guys,
[04:50.700 --> 04:51.540]  because I'll miss somebody
[04:51.540 --> 04:52.500]  and then I'll feel like an asshole.
[04:52.500 --> 04:54.020]  But ran into the whole New Mexico crew,
[04:54.020 --> 04:55.100]  got to see a bunch of great people
[04:55.100 --> 04:57.020]  at the Ambrosia Days party.
[04:57.020 --> 04:59.740]  And I got to check out a place called Strictly Vibe
[04:59.740 --> 05:00.700]  for the first time.
[05:00.700 --> 05:01.540]  Really cool place.
[05:01.540 --> 05:02.980]  I'm sure if there are more events there,
[05:02.980 --> 05:03.980]  I will be hanging out.
[05:03.980 --> 05:05.780]  The place is totally Rasta themed.
[05:05.780 --> 05:07.360]  Everything is red, gold, and green.
[05:07.360 --> 05:09.600]  It kind of felt welcoming there.
[05:09.600 --> 05:12.580]  So that's how my 7-10, pre-7-10 weekend went.
[05:12.580 --> 05:14.180]  I picked up plenty of great concentrates.
[05:14.180 --> 05:16.900]  I had a nice variety to dab on throughout the weekend.
[05:16.900 --> 05:19.060]  I hung out with Mike a little bit yesterday.
[05:19.060 --> 05:20.380]  Had a nice 7-10 today.
[05:20.380 --> 05:22.200]  Did a nice little Instagram live video.
[05:22.200 --> 05:24.120]  And now here we are recording a podcast
[05:24.120 --> 05:27.020]  late in the evening on 7-10.
[05:27.020 --> 05:29.300]  Let's get into the point of this podcast.
[05:29.300 --> 05:31.180]  You guys have been going for almost six minutes now
[05:31.180 --> 05:32.740]  and we haven't even talked about anything.
[05:32.740 --> 05:34.140]  So let's jump into it.
[05:34.140 --> 05:36.900]  This episode of the podcast is going to be about
[05:36.900 --> 05:39.300]  keeping a journal for your cannabis grow.
[05:39.300 --> 05:41.980]  Keeping notes, keeping track of what you've done,
[05:41.980 --> 05:45.600]  and having sort of a notebook to look back through
[05:45.600 --> 05:47.960]  when something goes right or something goes wrong.
[05:47.960 --> 05:51.280]  So let's talk about journaling your cannabis grow.
[05:52.560 --> 05:54.520]  Now before we talk about keeping notes
[05:54.520 --> 05:57.040]  and taking a journal for your grow,
[05:57.040 --> 06:00.420]  let me say that I can't promote people
[06:00.420 --> 06:02.880]  growing cannabis in illegal places.
[06:02.880 --> 06:04.700]  If it's illegal for you to grow,
[06:04.700 --> 06:07.320]  maybe you shouldn't be doing that where you are.
[06:07.320 --> 06:09.840]  I can't advocate that legally.
[06:09.840 --> 06:13.160]  I've gotta say, if it's illegal, don't do it.
[06:13.160 --> 06:17.240]  But if you insist on growing cannabis in an illegal place,
[06:17.240 --> 06:19.320]  maybe you shouldn't keep as careful notes
[06:19.320 --> 06:22.000]  as the people in Colorado and California
[06:22.000 --> 06:24.900]  and other legal locations are going to keep.
[06:24.900 --> 06:28.280]  Maybe you're keeping incriminating evidence.
[06:28.280 --> 06:30.360]  Maybe you wanna skip keeping a journal.
[06:30.360 --> 06:32.400]  Maybe you wanna create a Google Doc
[06:32.400 --> 06:34.020]  and use code words or something.
[06:35.240 --> 06:38.360]  Maybe you don't wanna have this evidence laying around.
[06:38.360 --> 06:39.840]  But like I said before,
[06:39.840 --> 06:43.160]  I don't promote you growing in an illegal area.
[06:43.160 --> 06:45.720]  So that's something to think about.
[06:46.280 --> 06:48.000]  With that being said,
[06:48.000 --> 06:50.000]  if you live in a location where it is legal
[06:50.000 --> 06:51.860]  to grow and produce cannabis,
[06:51.860 --> 06:54.920]  take excessive notes, write everything down
[06:54.920 --> 06:58.280]  because those notes will come to use in the future.
[06:58.280 --> 07:00.800]  Now before we start talking about taking notes,
[07:00.800 --> 07:02.900]  let's talk about the actual journal.
[07:02.900 --> 07:05.080]  I'm not too picky about what kind of journal you use.
[07:05.080 --> 07:06.440]  I've got a large notebook here,
[07:06.440 --> 07:08.020]  a college rule notebook on the table.
[07:08.020 --> 07:10.520]  This is what I take notes in for the podcast.
[07:10.520 --> 07:12.160]  This would work fine as a journal.
[07:12.160 --> 07:13.880]  Open it up, start writing in it.
[07:13.880 --> 07:15.720]  Whatever you do in your garden, write it down.
[07:15.720 --> 07:17.640]  We're gonna talk more about what to write down.
[07:17.640 --> 07:19.760]  It doesn't have to be broken down into categories.
[07:19.760 --> 07:21.960]  It doesn't have to be looking like homework.
[07:21.960 --> 07:23.020]  Just write down what you do.
[07:23.020 --> 07:25.620]  Just open up the notebook, write the date,
[07:25.620 --> 07:27.520]  write what phase of the grow you're in.
[07:27.520 --> 07:29.020]  Maybe write the strain of plants.
[07:29.020 --> 07:30.640]  Maybe on the front page, write a paragraph
[07:30.640 --> 07:32.960]  if you feel like, like how many plants you've got,
[07:32.960 --> 07:33.920]  how many lives you're running.
[07:33.920 --> 07:35.840]  Just write, just write in there.
[07:35.840 --> 07:37.040]  Then turn the next page.
[07:37.040 --> 07:39.240]  And when you go in the garden, write down what you do.
[07:39.240 --> 07:40.440]  Today I did this.
[07:40.440 --> 07:41.680]  And then just write that shit down.
[07:41.680 --> 07:44.240]  You'll start designing your journal
[07:44.240 --> 07:45.480]  the way you want it over time.
[07:45.480 --> 07:47.400]  It will morph into what you want it to be.
[07:47.400 --> 07:50.320]  So I've got this college rule notebook here also next to me
[07:50.320 --> 07:52.840]  that I've got another little side project of notes going on.
[07:52.840 --> 07:54.880]  It's just a little tiny nine and a half
[07:54.880 --> 07:55.880]  by six inch notebook.
[07:55.880 --> 07:57.140]  It's a smaller notebook.
[07:57.140 --> 07:59.920]  That would work just fine for a grow journal.
[07:59.920 --> 08:03.480]  I've seen guys use little tiny flip books, little notebooks.
[08:03.480 --> 08:06.200]  I've seen guys use fancy binder notebooks.
[08:06.200 --> 08:07.880]  Or you don't have to even use paper.
[08:07.880 --> 08:09.880]  You can use a Google doc if you want.
[08:09.880 --> 08:12.040]  You can use the note application in your phone
[08:12.040 --> 08:13.160]  if you'd like.
[08:13.160 --> 08:16.080]  I would rather see you use something that can't get lost,
[08:16.080 --> 08:17.080]  that note application.
[08:17.080 --> 08:17.960]  You can delete that.
[08:17.960 --> 08:18.800]  That's gone.
[08:18.800 --> 08:19.760]  Once you delete that, you fucked up.
[08:19.760 --> 08:20.680]  It's gone forever.
[08:20.680 --> 08:23.560]  Have something, maybe a hard copy you can hold on to.
[08:23.560 --> 08:24.400]  I like that better.
[08:24.400 --> 08:26.080]  But like I said, if you're in an illegal place,
[08:26.080 --> 08:28.460]  that becomes evidence in the worst case scenario.
[08:28.460 --> 08:31.080]  So if you need a digital copy, that's the way to do it.
[08:31.080 --> 08:33.260]  Something you can delete really quickly if you need to.
[08:33.260 --> 08:34.280]  That may be key.
[08:34.280 --> 08:37.200]  Something that's password protected if you need to.
[08:37.200 --> 08:38.520]  Anyway, keep a journal.
[08:38.520 --> 08:40.600]  It doesn't matter how the journal is kept.
[08:40.600 --> 08:42.320]  Something that works for you.
[08:42.320 --> 08:43.880]  All of our brains work differently.
[08:43.880 --> 08:46.400]  All of us set up our thoughts and projects differently.
[08:46.400 --> 08:48.760]  As long as you're taking notes and keeping track of things,
[08:48.760 --> 08:51.320]  you were journaling, and it doesn't matter how it's done.
[08:51.320 --> 08:53.560]  As long as you can read that shit.
[08:53.560 --> 08:55.800]  Don't scribble down a note thinking you're cute,
[08:55.800 --> 08:58.120]  writing just some quick shorthand stuff,
[08:58.120 --> 09:00.360]  seven initial letters and then a number
[09:00.360 --> 09:02.040]  and then milliliters next to it.
[09:02.040 --> 09:02.880]  And you're gonna come back and you're gonna go,
[09:02.880 --> 09:04.760]  what the fuck did I even write?
[09:04.760 --> 09:06.680]  Like, write clearly, write legibly,
[09:06.680 --> 09:08.140]  write what you're talking about.
[09:08.760 --> 09:09.580]  And then when you go back to read those notes
[09:09.580 --> 09:12.620]  in the future, you'll be able to repeat what you did before
[09:12.620 --> 09:14.060]  and you'll have a repeatable outcome.
[09:14.060 --> 09:15.340]  It won't be a guessing game.
[09:15.340 --> 09:17.940]  So, keep a simple journal.
[09:17.940 --> 09:19.080]  Keep a detailed journal.
[09:19.080 --> 09:20.540]  As long as you're keeping a journal
[09:20.540 --> 09:22.740]  on either paper or digitally, I'm happy.
[09:22.740 --> 09:25.100]  Now let's actually talk about journaling.
[09:25.100 --> 09:27.360]  Let's talk about the advantage of keeping notes.
[09:27.360 --> 09:28.260]  What is the advantage?
[09:28.260 --> 09:31.020]  Why do I wanna write this stuff down?
[09:31.020 --> 09:33.940]  There are several advantages to keeping a grow journal
[09:33.940 --> 09:36.020]  and keeping grow notes.
[09:36.020 --> 09:37.780]  One of the biggest advantages is,
[09:38.420 --> 09:40.020]  let's say we're trying to dial in a new nutrient system.
[09:40.020 --> 09:42.100]  I've been trying to get everybody addicted to VegBloom.
[09:42.100 --> 09:44.020]  Let's say you just started using VegBloom.
[09:44.020 --> 09:45.220]  It's your first run.
[09:45.220 --> 09:46.460]  You're dialing it in.
[09:46.460 --> 09:47.620]  You don't know how those plants
[09:47.620 --> 09:49.220]  are gonna react to VegBloom.
[09:49.220 --> 09:52.460]  So let's start a grow journal for the VegBloom grow.
[09:52.460 --> 09:54.720]  On page one, you say, I'm in veg.
[09:54.720 --> 09:56.460]  I'm using this much VegBloom.
[09:56.460 --> 09:58.220]  You write down everything you put in there
[09:58.220 --> 09:59.120]  and then you grow.
[09:59.120 --> 10:00.120]  You run the whole cycle.
[10:00.120 --> 10:01.300]  You write down everything you do
[10:01.300 --> 10:03.080]  and at the end, if you're happy with it,
[10:03.080 --> 10:05.420]  you can look back and you go, huh, that's how I did it.
[10:05.420 --> 10:06.700]  And you can repeat that.
[10:06.700 --> 10:07.860]  If you're not happy with it,
[10:07.860 --> 10:09.900]  you can look back and see where you screwed up
[10:09.900 --> 10:12.140]  or you can see where you can adjust and make it better.
[10:12.140 --> 10:14.380]  That's the main point of keeping notes.
[10:14.380 --> 10:16.180]  You can repeat it if something goes right
[10:16.180 --> 10:18.700]  or you can correct it if something goes wrong.
[10:18.700 --> 10:21.120]  You have got records and at the same time,
[10:21.120 --> 10:22.620]  you're creating an SOP,
[10:22.620 --> 10:24.940]  which we'll talk about in a little bit.
[10:24.940 --> 10:27.580]  Let's say you're growing and you're in flower
[10:27.580 --> 10:30.340]  and about week four, you start seeing an issue.
[10:30.340 --> 10:32.860]  You can use those notes from the past
[10:32.860 --> 10:35.860]  to help you correct and identify a problem.
[10:35.860 --> 10:36.980]  You can look back and you can say,
[10:36.980 --> 10:39.540]  oh, I fed it cow mag too many days in a row
[10:39.540 --> 10:41.220]  and you'll know because you wrote it down.
[10:41.220 --> 10:43.260]  And now instead of wondering what the problem is,
[10:43.260 --> 10:44.780]  you've got a note that says right here,
[10:44.780 --> 10:46.220]  I fed it cow mag on Monday.
[10:46.220 --> 10:48.580]  I also fucked up and gave it cow mag on Wednesday.
[10:48.580 --> 10:50.340]  It's probably got too much cow mag
[10:50.340 --> 10:51.740]  and now you've got a record.
[10:51.740 --> 10:53.720]  Also, hopefully this will prevent you
[10:53.720 --> 10:55.180]  from feeding it too much cow mag
[10:55.180 --> 10:56.540]  because you wrote down in the journal.
[10:56.540 --> 10:58.100]  All you have to do is turn back two pages
[10:58.100 --> 10:59.700]  and see what you fed it two days ago,
[10:59.700 --> 11:01.280]  see what you fed it the past few days
[11:01.280 --> 11:02.780]  and you know, oh, I gave it cow mag.
[11:02.780 --> 11:04.460]  She won't need cow mag for a few days.
[11:04.460 --> 11:05.540]  She'll be just fine.
[11:06.220 --> 11:08.260]  So that's some of the advantages of keeping notes.
[11:08.260 --> 11:10.620]  Also, you've got data for the future.
[11:10.620 --> 11:13.480]  If you love the outcome, you know what you did.
[11:13.480 --> 11:15.300]  You can do it all over again.
[11:15.300 --> 11:17.340]  If you're not satisfied with the outcome,
[11:17.340 --> 11:18.660]  you can try to fix it.
[11:18.660 --> 11:20.580]  And then here's the best part,
[11:20.580 --> 11:22.840]  grow again and change something
[11:22.840 --> 11:24.420]  and then see how you like that outcome
[11:24.420 --> 11:25.900]  and then compare the two notes.
[11:25.900 --> 11:28.100]  See what you did differently and see what you did the same.
[11:28.100 --> 11:29.940]  Then you can create a test sample.
[11:29.940 --> 11:32.640]  You can create a base and you have some more to work from.
[11:32.640 --> 11:33.540]  You just need data.
[11:33.540 --> 11:35.500]  We're creating data for the future
[11:35.500 --> 11:36.820]  is what you're doing with journaling.
[11:36.820 --> 11:41.820]  And you can use that data to identify and correct problems.
[11:41.940 --> 11:43.020]  And prevent problems.
[11:43.020 --> 11:44.160]  I almost overlooked that part.
[11:44.160 --> 11:47.580]  We're using the data to prevent problems at the same time.
[11:47.580 --> 11:50.020]  Now, from a business person's point of view,
[11:50.020 --> 11:51.700]  if you're trying to open a grow
[11:51.700 --> 11:53.020]  or you're trying to run a grow
[11:53.020 --> 11:54.960]  or work at a grow for somebody,
[11:54.960 --> 11:57.660]  maybe you're trying to start your own business as a grow.
[11:57.660 --> 12:00.020]  Is the guy with all of the notes and details
[12:00.020 --> 12:02.680]  gonna be more likely to get financial backing
[12:02.680 --> 12:05.480]  or is it gonna be the guy with pictures of his plants?
[12:05.480 --> 12:07.440]  Which one of those feels more reliable
[12:07.440 --> 12:08.960]  from a business standpoint?
[12:08.960 --> 12:12.220]  So notes show accountability and responsibility
[12:12.220 --> 12:14.060]  and initiative at the same time.
[12:14.060 --> 12:16.560]  Also, science is all about taking notes.
[12:16.560 --> 12:19.000]  Any sort of progression is about keeping notes.
[12:19.000 --> 12:21.420]  How can you know if you're doing better or worse
[12:21.420 --> 12:23.320]  if you don't have anything to compare to?
[12:23.320 --> 12:25.680]  So that's another thing about taking notes.
[12:25.680 --> 12:28.200]  It's a very, once you get into the business world,
[12:28.200 --> 12:29.340]  it will be required.
[12:29.340 --> 12:31.320]  So start getting used to it now.
[12:31.320 --> 12:32.760]  All right, let's get focused again.
[12:32.760 --> 12:34.800]  I'm just talking to me when I say let's get focused.
[12:34.800 --> 12:35.640]  I get rambly.
[12:35.640 --> 12:37.120]  It may be all the dabs.
[12:37.120 --> 12:39.580]  All right, so we're talking about taking notes.
[12:39.580 --> 12:40.620]  What do we note?
[12:40.620 --> 12:42.040]  Note everything.
[12:42.040 --> 12:44.080]  Note what you are feeding your plants.
[12:44.080 --> 12:46.360]  Note what you are mixing.
[12:46.360 --> 12:49.120]  How much water are you using to feed the plants?
[12:49.120 --> 12:52.000]  How frequently are you feeding them?
[12:52.000 --> 12:53.940]  When you're mixing, what is in the mix?
[12:53.940 --> 12:55.200]  What are you putting in there?
[12:55.200 --> 12:56.680]  How much of your, what nutrient
[12:56.680 --> 12:58.480]  and how much of it are you putting in there?
[12:58.480 --> 13:00.280]  How often are they getting fed that?
[13:00.320 --> 13:01.560]  The way I would do this,
[13:01.560 --> 13:02.960]  I would open up a page in the notebook
[13:02.960 --> 13:04.320]  and I would write whatever it is.
[13:04.320 --> 13:09.320]  If you're in veg, whatever, July 10th, veg, week three.
[13:10.280 --> 13:12.440]  Today I fed five gallons of water.
[13:12.440 --> 13:16.120]  I mixed in five grams of base nutrients per gallon.
[13:16.120 --> 13:18.920]  I mixed in one gram of Plus Life per gallon.
[13:18.920 --> 13:21.920]  And then I gave it two mils of CalMag per gallon.
[13:21.920 --> 13:22.880]  And then I pH'd it.
[13:22.880 --> 13:24.600]  I would write down what went in there.
[13:24.600 --> 13:26.520]  I would write down the EC.
[13:26.520 --> 13:27.960]  I would write down the pH.
[13:27.960 --> 13:30.760]  And I would write down the temperature of my feed solution
[13:30.760 --> 13:33.000]  before I even carry that container of water
[13:33.000 --> 13:34.200]  to the plants to water it.
[13:34.200 --> 13:36.160]  All of that would get written down.
[13:36.160 --> 13:38.840]  Then I would water the plants to a point of runoff
[13:38.840 --> 13:40.400]  to where at least a little bit of water
[13:40.400 --> 13:42.200]  is coming out of each plant.
[13:42.200 --> 13:44.140]  I've got a catch tray under the plants.
[13:44.140 --> 13:45.480]  I would catch some of that water
[13:45.480 --> 13:48.040]  and I would put my EC meter and my pH pin
[13:48.040 --> 13:49.360]  in that runoff water.
[13:49.360 --> 13:52.480]  And I would document that runoff water as well.
[13:52.480 --> 13:54.820]  If you've got multiple plants in large containers,
[13:54.820 --> 13:56.120]  I would check several of them.
[13:56.120 --> 13:56.960]  I would check them all
[13:56.960 --> 13:58.520]  if you feel like you have time to do it
[13:58.520 --> 13:59.440]  and document this.
[13:59.440 --> 14:00.720]  When things go wrong,
[14:00.720 --> 14:03.160]  those runoff numbers may be indicators
[14:03.160 --> 14:04.880]  of when and where things went wrong.
[14:04.880 --> 14:06.820]  And then you can look back at your other notes
[14:06.820 --> 14:08.320]  and you can see what you fed it.
[14:08.320 --> 14:10.120]  And then we can compare that EC running off
[14:10.120 --> 14:11.680]  and we can see what's going on
[14:11.680 --> 14:14.680]  and what it's not eating and why the pH is fluctuating.
[14:14.680 --> 14:17.760]  We can figure all that out through the notes you're keeping.
[14:17.760 --> 14:19.480]  All right, so we're taking great notes of our feed.
[14:19.480 --> 14:21.560]  We're measuring what goes in and what comes out.
[14:21.560 --> 14:23.640]  So you've got a notebook and it says,
[14:23.640 --> 14:25.440]  veg week two or whatever.
[14:25.440 --> 14:26.880]  I'm just being hypothetical here.
[14:27.800 --> 14:31.400]  Veg week two, July 10th, fed this.
[14:31.400 --> 14:33.920]  pH in was this, EC in was this,
[14:33.920 --> 14:36.360]  temp in was this, runoff measurements were this.
[14:36.360 --> 14:37.840]  EC was this, pH was this.
[14:37.840 --> 14:39.280]  I don't measure the temperature of the runoff.
[14:39.280 --> 14:40.640]  That doesn't matter to me.
[14:40.640 --> 14:42.020]  Maybe it should, but it never has.
[14:42.020 --> 14:43.160]  It's never come into play.
[14:43.160 --> 14:45.960]  So write down what goes in, write down what goes out.
[14:45.960 --> 14:48.640]  Keep that document every time you feed.
[14:48.640 --> 14:51.200]  And then if you feed it water or something next time,
[14:51.200 --> 14:52.640]  just write that down.
[14:52.640 --> 14:55.280]  Write down almost everything you do in that grow.
[14:55.280 --> 14:57.600]  Almost think like it's an accountability sheet.
[14:57.600 --> 14:58.960]  So if somebody were to say,
[14:58.960 --> 15:00.560]  hey, what the fuck did you do all day?
[15:00.560 --> 15:01.920]  Then you could say, oh, I did this.
[15:01.920 --> 15:02.880]  I watered the plants.
[15:02.880 --> 15:03.720]  I gave them this.
[15:03.720 --> 15:05.400]  And you have got details.
[15:05.400 --> 15:06.800]  And then you've got everything written down.
[15:06.800 --> 15:09.040]  Write down everything that you do in the grow.
[15:09.040 --> 15:10.840]  So we'll move on to sprays.
[15:10.840 --> 15:12.760]  Write down your sprays.
[15:12.760 --> 15:15.780]  If it's a foliar feed, if it's a pesticide application,
[15:15.780 --> 15:19.080]  if it's a spot spray of one plant, write that down.
[15:19.080 --> 15:20.080]  And by a spot spray, I mean,
[15:20.080 --> 15:21.560]  if you're not spraying the entire room,
[15:21.560 --> 15:23.480]  if you just see one area where you're,
[15:23.480 --> 15:24.880]  you see some spider mite damage,
[15:25.520 --> 15:26.360]  but it hasn't sprayed and you don't feel
[15:26.360 --> 15:28.200]  like you wanna spray the entire crop yet,
[15:28.200 --> 15:30.440]  maybe you could just mix up a small batch of pesticides
[15:30.440 --> 15:32.360]  and apply that to one small area.
[15:32.360 --> 15:34.040]  That's what I call a spot treatment.
[15:34.040 --> 15:35.040]  Just hit that hotspot,
[15:35.040 --> 15:36.920]  get in there and make sure it doesn't spread.
[15:36.920 --> 15:38.200]  Just if you happen to see something,
[15:38.200 --> 15:39.600]  or if you've got a specific strain
[15:39.600 --> 15:41.040]  that you know gets mites,
[15:41.040 --> 15:42.920]  treat that fucker, pre-treat it.
[15:42.920 --> 15:46.640]  So anyway, write down every spray, every application,
[15:46.640 --> 15:49.460]  whether it's a pesticide, a feeding, a preventative,
[15:49.460 --> 15:51.720]  whatever it is, write down what you sprayed,
[15:51.720 --> 15:52.920]  write down the product,
[15:52.920 --> 15:55.280]  write down how much of it you applied,
[15:55.280 --> 15:56.800]  write down how much you mixed up.
[15:56.800 --> 15:59.320]  Say, you probably mix up a half a gallon or a gallon
[15:59.320 --> 16:00.640]  if you're a home grower,
[16:00.640 --> 16:03.480]  put, I mixed up a gallon of water.
[16:03.480 --> 16:05.520]  What pesticide did you put in there?
[16:05.520 --> 16:09.520]  Did you put 30 milliliters of evergreen in there?
[16:09.520 --> 16:12.720]  Did you put five milliliters of smite in there?
[16:12.720 --> 16:13.600]  What did you mix up?
[16:13.600 --> 16:17.240]  Is there also 25 or 50 milliliters of push in there?
[16:17.240 --> 16:18.600]  Write it all down.
[16:18.600 --> 16:20.220]  Did you check the pH of that?
[16:20.220 --> 16:22.520]  Some folks check the pH of their foliar feed,
[16:22.520 --> 16:23.800]  some folks don't.
[16:23.800 --> 16:25.980]  Some products, you should not adjust the pH,
[16:25.980 --> 16:28.440]  some products, you do need to adjust the pH.
[16:28.440 --> 16:30.560]  Write it down if you did or did not.
[16:30.560 --> 16:32.440]  Write down when it was applied.
[16:32.440 --> 16:35.960]  Write down if it was applied right before the lights came on
[16:35.960 --> 16:38.320]  write down if you turned off the lights and applied it,
[16:38.320 --> 16:40.560]  write down how long those lights were off.
[16:40.560 --> 16:42.240]  Check the plants before you turn the lights on
[16:42.240 --> 16:43.440]  and make sure they're dry.
[16:43.440 --> 16:45.480]  Note that you did that.
[16:45.480 --> 16:48.580]  Write down why you sprayed, why were you spraying?
[16:48.580 --> 16:49.480]  What was your purpose?
[16:49.480 --> 16:50.520]  Write that down.
[16:50.520 --> 16:52.360]  Like, act like there's another person
[16:53.200 --> 16:54.880]  that's gonna come check your notes.
[16:54.880 --> 16:56.640]  Act like I'm gonna come check your notes.
[16:56.640 --> 17:00.400]  Be like, so I see that you applied Azomax today, why?
[17:00.400 --> 17:01.860]  And then I should see right underneath that,
[17:01.860 --> 17:02.980]  oh, I see why.
[17:02.980 --> 17:05.880]  I identified spider mites or thrips in the garden today
[17:05.880 --> 17:08.620]  and I felt that it would be best to apply a product.
[17:08.620 --> 17:09.680]  So something like that.
[17:09.680 --> 17:12.040]  Write down why you applied some products.
[17:12.040 --> 17:15.280]  Then later on, write down the results.
[17:15.280 --> 17:16.820]  Did you see any results?
[17:16.820 --> 17:19.580]  Were there dead bugs hanging off of the leaves?
[17:19.580 --> 17:22.340]  Were there dead eggs somewhere in the grow room?
[17:23.180 --> 17:24.020]  Did the plants look like shit?
[17:24.020 --> 17:25.780]  Did the plants look better?
[17:25.780 --> 17:26.900]  Write down the results.
[17:26.900 --> 17:27.980]  What did you do?
[17:27.980 --> 17:29.620]  And write down the results.
[17:29.620 --> 17:31.900]  Write down why you did it, what you did,
[17:31.900 --> 17:33.940]  and how it reacted to it.
[17:33.940 --> 17:35.080]  And then you're gonna have to pay attention
[17:35.080 --> 17:36.940]  because sometimes a pesticide application
[17:36.940 --> 17:39.660]  won't show you problems for a couple of days.
[17:39.660 --> 17:41.240]  So pay attention to that.
[17:41.240 --> 17:42.580]  Write that down.
[17:42.580 --> 17:44.500]  Also, if you rinse the plants off,
[17:44.500 --> 17:46.820]  a lot of people will apply a foliar application.
[17:46.820 --> 17:49.500]  Some products, it's ideal to rinse them a few hours later.
[17:49.500 --> 17:51.260]  Write that down also.
[17:51.260 --> 17:52.820]  Detailed notes.
[17:52.820 --> 17:55.260]  Also, if you put in sort of a surfactant,
[17:55.260 --> 17:57.980]  maybe you're using some wet Betty or some cocoa wet
[17:57.980 --> 18:00.740]  inside of your foliar feed, write that down also.
[18:00.740 --> 18:03.940]  Everything that goes in should get written down is my point.
[18:03.940 --> 18:05.180]  So we're writing down the feeds.
[18:05.180 --> 18:06.740]  We're writing down the sprays.
[18:06.740 --> 18:08.900]  That's just about everything that is going into the plants.
[18:08.900 --> 18:10.260]  If you're making your own soil mix,
[18:10.260 --> 18:11.380]  I didn't write this down.
[18:11.380 --> 18:12.900]  If you're making your own soil mix,
[18:12.900 --> 18:14.720]  if you're making a super soil,
[18:14.720 --> 18:16.700]  write down everything you put into that.
[18:16.700 --> 18:17.700]  That's crucial.
[18:17.700 --> 18:20.340]  Write that down to the cup.
[18:20.340 --> 18:23.060]  If you're scooping cups or spoonfuls or whatever,
[18:23.060 --> 18:24.140]  write it down.
[18:24.140 --> 18:25.580]  Grams if you can.
[18:25.580 --> 18:26.700]  Highly detailed.
[18:26.700 --> 18:27.540]  Write that down.
[18:27.540 --> 18:30.260]  Your super soil mix should be dialed in.
[18:30.260 --> 18:32.380]  That's gonna take you a couple of runs to get it perfected.
[18:32.380 --> 18:33.380]  If you don't have notes,
[18:33.380 --> 18:34.820]  that's gonna be a bitch to dial that in
[18:34.820 --> 18:36.460]  because you might not remember what you did.
[18:36.460 --> 18:38.060]  We're smoking cannabis, you guys.
[18:38.060 --> 18:39.100]  We forget a lot of shit.
[18:39.100 --> 18:40.060]  Take a lot of notes.
[18:40.060 --> 18:41.620]  So let's move forward.
[18:41.620 --> 18:43.220]  More notes to take.
[18:43.220 --> 18:45.380]  Room and environment notes.
[18:45.380 --> 18:47.300]  Document the lights.
[18:47.300 --> 18:48.820]  Maybe you don't have a lumen meter,
[18:48.820 --> 18:50.340]  but pay attention.
[18:50.340 --> 18:52.100]  Document the temperature.
[18:52.100 --> 18:53.660]  Document the humidity.
[18:53.660 --> 18:56.100]  And if you can, pay attention to the CO2.
[18:56.100 --> 18:58.340]  There are several ways, several devices
[18:58.340 --> 19:00.520]  that'll document all these things for you.
[19:00.520 --> 19:03.300]  If you just need the cheap hygrometer and a pen and paper,
[19:03.300 --> 19:04.120]  do that.
[19:04.120 --> 19:04.960]  Write it down.
[19:04.960 --> 19:06.020]  Pay attention.
[19:06.020 --> 19:07.140]  See if you've got spikes.
[19:07.140 --> 19:08.260]  See if you've got valleys.
[19:08.260 --> 19:10.060]  See if you've got swings in your temperature
[19:10.060 --> 19:12.260]  and your humidity and your CO2.
[19:12.260 --> 19:14.860]  Hopefully you can get something like a PL Minder unit
[19:14.860 --> 19:16.460]  in there from PL Grow Systems.
[19:16.460 --> 19:18.540]  And you can pay attention to what's going on at all times,
[19:18.540 --> 19:20.220]  but we don't all have that ability.
[19:20.220 --> 19:22.940]  So you're gonna have to write it down and pay attention.
[19:22.940 --> 19:25.040]  Use one of those hygrometers and thermometers
[19:25.040 --> 19:26.300]  that gives you a high and a low,
[19:26.300 --> 19:28.780]  and it lets you know what the high got to and the low was.
[19:28.780 --> 19:30.300]  Do the best you can with what you've got.
[19:30.300 --> 19:31.580]  But take notes of that,
[19:31.580 --> 19:33.500]  because if it was too hot for too long,
[19:33.500 --> 19:34.820]  your buds will show you that.
[19:34.820 --> 19:36.380]  If it was too cold for too long,
[19:36.380 --> 19:37.860]  your buds will show you that.
[19:37.860 --> 19:39.620]  If it was too humid for too long,
[19:39.620 --> 19:41.020]  your buds will show you that in the end.
[19:41.020 --> 19:42.300]  And if you don't write it down,
[19:42.300 --> 19:43.260]  if you're not aware of it,
[19:43.260 --> 19:44.260]  then you can't correct it.
[19:44.260 --> 19:46.100]  And then you'll go, why are my buds so fluffy?
[19:46.100 --> 19:48.060]  You won't realize it was because they were too hot
[19:48.060 --> 19:49.900]  for too long, you may forget.
[19:49.900 --> 19:53.780]  So write down the room and environment notes that you see,
[19:53.780 --> 19:55.780]  the temperature, the humidity, and the CO2.
[19:55.780 --> 19:57.780]  And if you can measure the amount of light in there,
[19:57.780 --> 20:00.180]  if you've got a lumen meter, do that.
[20:00.180 --> 20:01.860]  Not required, just helpful.
[20:01.860 --> 20:04.420]  That helps you know when to replace your bulbs.
[20:04.420 --> 20:05.860]  And when it comes to commercial growing,
[20:05.860 --> 20:08.980]  that really makes a huge difference on U moles
[20:08.980 --> 20:12.220]  and par watts and how much lighting per square foot.
[20:12.220 --> 20:14.140]  It really comes into play in the commercial grow.
[20:14.140 --> 20:16.140]  Anyway, let's move forward with what we're focused on
[20:16.140 --> 20:17.820]  and keep me focused today.
[20:17.820 --> 20:19.440]  Write down schedule notes.
[20:20.480 --> 20:21.460]  Are you in veg?
[20:21.460 --> 20:22.860]  Are you in flower?
[20:22.860 --> 20:24.820]  Write down when veg started.
[20:24.820 --> 20:26.340]  Write down when flower started.
[20:26.340 --> 20:29.620]  Write down what time the lights are coming on and going off.
[20:29.620 --> 20:31.940]  I've had situations.
[20:31.940 --> 20:33.360]  Now I use a digital timer.
[20:33.360 --> 20:34.300]  So if the power goes out,
[20:34.300 --> 20:35.540]  there's a backup battery in there
[20:35.540 --> 20:38.060]  and it'll stay on the correct time.
[20:38.060 --> 20:40.360]  A long time ago before I was smarter than that,
[20:40.360 --> 20:41.960]  I was using old analog timers.
[20:41.960 --> 20:44.520]  If the power went out, the timer quit spinning.
[20:44.520 --> 20:46.120]  So it is now wrong.
[20:46.120 --> 20:48.020]  For however long the power is out,
[20:48.020 --> 20:49.960]  my timer is that many hours off.
[20:50.940 --> 20:53.240]  Sometimes I didn't remember what time the lights came on.
[20:53.240 --> 20:55.080]  Did I have those lights coming on at 7 a.m.
[20:55.080 --> 20:56.800]  or did they come on at 9 a.m.?
[20:56.800 --> 20:57.860]  I don't remember.
[20:57.860 --> 20:59.000]  So now you gotta guess.
[20:59.000 --> 21:00.320]  Write that shit down.
[21:00.320 --> 21:01.220]  Take some notes.
[21:01.220 --> 21:02.440]  Have some accountability.
[21:02.440 --> 21:03.920]  Notes will save your ass.
[21:03.920 --> 21:05.200]  In the long run, one day you're gonna go,
[21:05.200 --> 21:07.800]  oh, I'm so glad I wrote that shit down.
[21:07.800 --> 21:08.760]  Just write that down.
[21:08.760 --> 21:09.960]  Every little thing you can think of.
[21:09.960 --> 21:10.800]  Schedule notes.
[21:10.800 --> 21:11.620]  What time do the lights come on?
[21:12.300 --> 21:13.140]  What time do the lights go off?
[21:13.140 --> 21:14.980]  What time does my AC come on?
[21:14.980 --> 21:16.980]  What time does that hydro pump come on?
[21:16.980 --> 21:18.180]  Just write down everything.
[21:18.180 --> 21:19.820]  If you're running hydro and stuff
[21:19.820 --> 21:21.380]  and you've gotta do different cycles,
[21:21.380 --> 21:23.080]  if you're running a flood and drain
[21:23.080 --> 21:24.420]  or some sort of ebb and flow,
[21:24.420 --> 21:27.660]  write down how long it takes for that stuff to wet and dry
[21:27.660 --> 21:29.220]  and how frequently you're watering.
[21:29.220 --> 21:30.360]  That may help you out in the future
[21:30.360 --> 21:32.340]  when you're trying to plan future grows.
[21:32.340 --> 21:34.460]  So staying on the same note of scheduling,
[21:34.460 --> 21:36.620]  write down when you cut your clones.
[21:36.620 --> 21:38.900]  Write down when you sprout your seeds.
[21:38.900 --> 21:41.780]  Write down everything you can, you guys.
[21:41.780 --> 21:44.140]  Write down when those clones came out of the cloner
[21:44.140 --> 21:45.100]  and into dirt.
[21:45.100 --> 21:47.220]  Write down every transplant and up-pot
[21:47.220 --> 21:49.460]  that you can write down.
[21:49.460 --> 21:50.500]  Keep notes on everything.
[21:50.500 --> 21:52.180]  That way you can keep track.
[21:52.180 --> 21:53.660]  Then when you're looking to grow in the future,
[21:53.660 --> 21:55.680]  you can say, huh, I don't have a lot of time.
[21:55.680 --> 21:58.900]  Which plants veg the fastest out of my selection?
[21:58.900 --> 22:00.140]  Do I wanna run this OG
[22:00.140 --> 22:01.860]  or do I wanna run this strawberry haze?
[22:01.860 --> 22:02.700]  And you're gonna look back
[22:02.700 --> 22:03.540]  and you're gonna see in your notes
[22:03.540 --> 22:06.420]  that that strawberry haze only needed two weeks to veg.
[22:06.420 --> 22:09.460]  And that OG kush needed four because it's a slow veger.
[22:09.460 --> 22:11.340]  And then you'll say, oh shit, let's run the strawberry.
[22:11.340 --> 22:12.960]  So notes are gonna help you.
[22:12.960 --> 22:14.940]  So then of course you're gonna wanna write down
[22:14.940 --> 22:16.940]  when you start your veg cycle.
[22:16.940 --> 22:19.300]  You're gonna definitely want to write down
[22:19.300 --> 22:21.380]  when you start your bloom cycle.
[22:21.380 --> 22:25.500]  Also, write down your anticipated flush date.
[22:25.500 --> 22:28.660]  If you anticipate a flush date, write that down.
[22:28.660 --> 22:32.700]  Also, it's wise to create a feed schedule in advance
[22:32.700 --> 22:34.060]  and try to stay on top of it.
[22:34.060 --> 22:35.860]  If you're gonna grow for nine weeks,
[22:36.300 --> 22:38.540]  write yourself out a seven week feed schedule
[22:38.540 --> 22:41.500]  and tasks to do throughout those seven weeks.
[22:41.500 --> 22:42.860]  And then when you turn the page one day
[22:42.860 --> 22:44.020]  when you're going to work,
[22:44.020 --> 22:45.020]  you're gonna water the plants,
[22:45.020 --> 22:46.460]  it's gonna say flush today.
[22:46.460 --> 22:47.700]  And you're gonna go, oh cool,
[22:47.700 --> 22:49.640]  I'm 10 to 14 days away from harvest,
[22:49.640 --> 22:50.980]  I should start flushing.
[22:50.980 --> 22:53.300]  So prepare that, write yourself a schedule
[22:53.300 --> 22:54.900]  along with your journal.
[22:54.900 --> 22:58.780]  Then also write down when you started flushing.
[22:58.780 --> 23:01.460]  Also, you're gonna be paying attention to the trichomes.
[23:01.460 --> 23:03.420]  Every day when you're looking in there with a scope,
[23:03.420 --> 23:04.540]  write down what you see.
[23:04.540 --> 23:05.360]  Why not?
[23:05.880 --> 23:07.080]  Write down today on July 10th,
[23:07.080 --> 23:09.100]  I looked at my strawberry fields plant,
[23:09.100 --> 23:10.560]  I looked at the top buds,
[23:10.560 --> 23:12.360]  all the trichomes were milky,
[23:12.360 --> 23:13.800]  but toward the bottom there were a couple of
[23:13.800 --> 23:15.680]  amber trichomes on the bottom of the plant.
[23:15.680 --> 23:17.300]  Write that down, why not?
[23:17.300 --> 23:18.860]  Write that all down.
[23:18.860 --> 23:20.700]  So you're writing down everything, you guys.
[23:20.700 --> 23:21.760]  I know I'm being redundant,
[23:21.760 --> 23:23.320]  but you guys might forget some of this stuff.
[23:23.320 --> 23:25.560]  And I point out things that you guys may have missed.
[23:25.560 --> 23:27.320]  So write down the day you started flushing,
[23:27.320 --> 23:29.080]  that way you don't forget.
[23:29.080 --> 23:30.400]  Because I've forgotten.
[23:30.400 --> 23:31.880]  You'll be in the grow room like,
[23:31.880 --> 23:33.560]  did I give them nutrients last time?
[23:33.560 --> 23:35.200]  Or have I given them straight water?
[23:36.040 --> 23:36.880]  You'll be flushing for two times,
[23:36.880 --> 23:38.560]  and you'll fuck up and pour nutrients in the plant,
[23:38.560 --> 23:39.840]  and you're like, oh yeah, I fucked up.
[23:39.840 --> 23:41.600]  So write it down, pay attention.
[23:41.600 --> 23:44.800]  Just have yourself some solid notes.
[23:44.800 --> 23:47.640]  Also, document any sort of defoliation,
[23:47.640 --> 23:50.080]  and popping, and topping, and lollipopping.
[23:50.080 --> 23:51.600]  Write that stuff down.
[23:51.600 --> 23:54.240]  Because some plants are going to react poorly to it.
[23:54.240 --> 23:56.480]  Some plants are going to love it.
[23:56.480 --> 23:58.040]  If you write down everything,
[23:58.040 --> 24:00.200]  you know when you pissed off a plant.
[24:00.200 --> 24:01.680]  And you can look through the notes and go,
[24:01.680 --> 24:04.280]  so this OG kush plant got pissed off around week three,
[24:04.320 --> 24:05.160]  and you know what happened.
[24:05.160 --> 24:06.000]  And you look at your notes and you go,
[24:06.000 --> 24:08.560]  oh, we defoliated the fuck out of it on week three,
[24:08.560 --> 24:10.600]  and we also fed it too much cow mag.
[24:10.600 --> 24:11.800]  You'll be able to look at your notes,
[24:11.800 --> 24:15.000]  and you'll have some sort of an idea of where you went wrong.
[24:15.000 --> 24:16.120]  And that's going to be really helpful
[24:16.120 --> 24:18.520]  for when we go to grow that same OG kush next time.
[24:18.520 --> 24:20.080]  We'll go, oh look, in week three, bro,
[24:20.080 --> 24:21.440]  don't defoliate the shit out of it,
[24:21.440 --> 24:23.000]  and don't OD it on cow mag.
[24:23.000 --> 24:24.960]  And it'll be much happier than it was last time.
[24:24.960 --> 24:26.440]  And then you'll learn how to dial it in.
[24:26.440 --> 24:29.200]  Notes will help you out with that a lot.
[24:29.200 --> 24:31.920]  Now as a breeder and a pheno hunter,
[24:31.920 --> 24:34.000]  this is one of my favorite parts.
[24:34.680 --> 24:37.760]  Document any growth details and anything notable.
[24:37.760 --> 24:39.880]  Does that plant make pretty colors?
[24:39.880 --> 24:41.720]  Does that plant grow weird?
[24:41.720 --> 24:43.080]  Did it do something strange?
[24:43.080 --> 24:44.680]  Did it spit out extra nodes?
[24:44.680 --> 24:46.520]  Did it spit out extra branches?
[24:46.520 --> 24:48.800]  Are the branches really close and compact together?
[24:48.800 --> 24:50.500]  Did anything strange happen?
[24:50.500 --> 24:51.720]  Anything notable?
[24:51.720 --> 24:53.140]  Write down growth details.
[24:53.140 --> 24:54.440]  Did it get really tall?
[24:54.440 --> 24:56.200]  Did it stay remarkably short?
[24:56.200 --> 24:57.780]  Did something happen when you topped it?
[24:57.780 --> 25:00.840]  Did something happen when you did some lollipopping?
[25:00.840 --> 25:03.120]  Write down anything you notice
[25:03.120 --> 25:05.320]  that is notable about the growth of that plant,
[25:05.320 --> 25:09.520]  whether it's colors, whether it's just extra branching,
[25:09.520 --> 25:11.640]  anything you see that may get your attention,
[25:11.640 --> 25:13.020]  write it down.
[25:13.020 --> 25:15.960]  Also, if anything happened in that room environmentally
[25:15.960 --> 25:17.640]  when that weird change happened,
[25:17.640 --> 25:19.440]  document that on a side note,
[25:19.440 --> 25:20.720]  and let's pay attention to that
[25:20.720 --> 25:22.460]  over the next couple of cycles.
[25:22.460 --> 25:24.080]  So let's say maybe it got,
[25:24.080 --> 25:26.040]  maybe the air conditioner didn't go off one night,
[25:26.040 --> 25:27.300]  or maybe it got a little extra cool
[25:27.300 --> 25:28.920]  just because it cooled down tonight,
[25:28.920 --> 25:30.320]  and it got cool in the grow room,
[25:30.320 --> 25:32.160]  and it rained, and the room got a little cooler
[25:32.160 --> 25:34.400]  and more humid, and the next day you noticed
[25:34.400 --> 25:38.600]  that some of the leaves were turning a little bit purple.
[25:38.600 --> 25:39.680]  And now we're gonna note that.
[25:39.680 --> 25:40.760]  It got a little cold in the room,
[25:40.760 --> 25:41.720]  and the leaves were purple.
[25:41.720 --> 25:43.440]  The next time we grow it, we're gonna pay attention.
[25:43.440 --> 25:45.000]  Does it have to get cold to get it purple?
[25:45.000 --> 25:46.760]  Or around this same time period,
[25:46.760 --> 25:48.360]  does it purple up on its own?
[25:48.360 --> 25:49.840]  And we'll start knowing.
[25:49.840 --> 25:52.020]  Do those leaves get purple because of cold,
[25:52.020 --> 25:54.440]  or do they get purple because of straight genetics?
[25:54.440 --> 25:56.420]  And then if we wanna make it purple in the future,
[25:56.420 --> 25:59.100]  and it's just genetics, we can add that purple again,
[25:59.100 --> 26:01.520]  or add that cold again, and bring out the purple.
[26:01.560 --> 26:04.000]  We'll know that it's something that we can control.
[26:04.000 --> 26:06.960]  Just taking notes will give you more ideas.
[26:06.960 --> 26:08.400]  And sometimes you find things in a plant
[26:08.400 --> 26:09.480]  that you wanna repeat.
[26:09.480 --> 26:10.720]  Sometimes you find things in a plant
[26:10.720 --> 26:12.000]  you don't want to repeat,
[26:12.000 --> 26:14.260]  and this is the way to know how to do it.
[26:14.260 --> 26:16.880]  So a moment ago I mentioned the air conditioner failure.
[26:16.880 --> 26:18.480]  Maybe the air conditioner didn't turn off.
[26:18.480 --> 26:19.760]  Maybe the heater didn't come on.
[26:19.760 --> 26:22.280]  Maybe the fuckin' air conditioner didn't come on,
[26:22.280 --> 26:23.960]  and it got real hot.
[26:23.960 --> 26:26.880]  Document any incidents or accidents
[26:26.880 --> 26:28.920]  that you may have in that grow room.
[26:28.920 --> 26:31.080]  Even if you fucked up, it's your grow room.
[26:31.840 --> 26:33.640]  Yeah, I said earlier I'm gonna come check your notes.
[26:33.640 --> 26:34.960]  That's all right, I'm not gonna get mad at you.
[26:34.960 --> 26:36.120]  I have fucked up in grow rooms.
[26:36.120 --> 26:37.440]  I have fallen asleep with a grow room
[26:37.440 --> 26:39.160]  with the flower room door open before.
[26:39.160 --> 26:40.000]  Guess what?
[26:40.000 --> 26:41.920]  You got a seed, or a crop full of seeds.
[26:41.920 --> 26:43.000]  I just cut it down and threw it away.
[26:43.000 --> 26:44.360]  As soon as I saw the seeds forming,
[26:44.360 --> 26:46.360]  I was like, nope, I fucked up.
[26:46.360 --> 26:47.640]  Just threw it all away.
[26:47.640 --> 26:49.360]  A whole, it was just one small room.
[26:49.360 --> 26:50.840]  It was like nine plants under one light,
[26:50.840 --> 26:53.040]  but I fell asleep with that door open.
[26:53.040 --> 26:54.480]  I think I went and got myself some food.
[26:54.480 --> 26:55.720]  I went and ate, and then I fell asleep,
[26:55.720 --> 26:57.360]  and I left the grow room door open
[26:57.360 --> 26:58.720]  because I was just letting it get fresh air.
[26:58.720 --> 26:59.760]  I had the fan blowing in there.
[26:59.920 --> 27:01.600]  You don't wanna stifle the room all day,
[27:01.600 --> 27:03.680]  and when you can give it some fresh air, you can.
[27:03.680 --> 27:05.840]  But I ate pizza, and got stoned, fell asleep,
[27:05.840 --> 27:08.160]  and I woke up later, and I was like, oh, you know what?
[27:08.160 --> 27:10.400]  And I walked in there, and it was fucking dark in the room,
[27:10.400 --> 27:12.040]  and the door was open, and the light from the hallway
[27:12.040 --> 27:13.520]  was just shining right in there.
[27:13.520 --> 27:14.560]  So I knew there was a problem.
[27:14.560 --> 27:16.480]  But as soon as I saw the seed pods form,
[27:16.480 --> 27:18.520]  those plants got killed, so I fucked up.
[27:18.520 --> 27:20.360]  So write down if you leave a door open.
[27:20.360 --> 27:21.640]  Write down if you leave a light on.
[27:21.640 --> 27:22.920]  Write down if something goes wrong.
[27:22.920 --> 27:24.880]  Write down if you did something wrong.
[27:24.880 --> 27:26.600]  Maybe you fucked up and overfed something.
[27:26.600 --> 27:27.440]  Write it down.
[27:27.440 --> 27:29.840]  It's gonna help you identify a problem in the future,
[27:29.840 --> 27:33.360]  and it will help you not do that mistake again.
[27:33.360 --> 27:36.600]  Also, write down if you adjusted any equipment.
[27:36.600 --> 27:38.640]  Did you change any air conditioning settings?
[27:38.640 --> 27:40.160]  Did you change any timer settings?
[27:40.160 --> 27:42.040]  Did you mess with that fan in the corner?
[27:42.040 --> 27:43.660]  Did you change anything?
[27:43.660 --> 27:45.680]  Make a little section on your notes for today
[27:45.680 --> 27:47.320]  of any equipment that you changed.
[27:47.320 --> 27:48.840]  What did you adjust?
[27:48.840 --> 27:52.300]  Because small adjustments can create huge problems
[27:52.300 --> 27:54.080]  over several hours in a grow room.
[27:54.080 --> 27:57.040]  Maybe you turned that fan from low to high,
[27:57.640 --> 28:00.000]  and that one bud that it's just been kicking the shit out of
[28:00.000 --> 28:03.140]  every time it rotates, that one bud is gonna get dried out.
[28:03.140 --> 28:05.260]  The leaves are gonna start looking leathery and crispy.
[28:05.260 --> 28:06.760]  It's gonna start tacoing up,
[28:06.760 --> 28:09.200]  or it's gonna get that claw and start clawing down.
[28:09.200 --> 28:10.780]  It's gonna start looking like a leather leaf.
[28:10.780 --> 28:12.960]  It's gonna look like a fake plant instead of a real plant.
[28:12.960 --> 28:14.640]  That bud's gonna get all dry.
[28:14.640 --> 28:15.880]  The plant's gonna be trying to send
[28:15.880 --> 28:18.820]  all of its moisture up there to keep that one piece
[28:18.820 --> 28:20.760]  of plant living and happy, and it's not gonna do it.
[28:20.760 --> 28:23.360]  It's gonna make that whole plant struggle.
[28:23.360 --> 28:24.360]  Document that shit.
[28:24.360 --> 28:26.640]  You could be like, oh, yesterday I put that fan
[28:27.280 --> 28:29.280]  on three, that's why it looks like shit.
[28:29.280 --> 28:30.840]  And just document things like that.
[28:30.840 --> 28:33.480]  Any sort of update or adjustment that you do.
[28:33.480 --> 28:34.560]  Did you change a timer?
[28:34.560 --> 28:35.800]  Did you move a fan?
[28:35.800 --> 28:37.200]  Did you do something to the AC?
[28:37.200 --> 28:38.800]  Did you change the CO2?
[28:38.800 --> 28:42.920]  Anything like that, make sure you write that stuff down.
[28:42.920 --> 28:46.560]  Now here's some other things that you may not think about.
[28:46.560 --> 28:50.120]  Write down whenever you change your bulbs.
[28:50.120 --> 28:52.040]  A lot of people forget when the bulbs are changed.
[28:52.040 --> 28:54.240]  It's a good idea if you've got a bulb,
[28:54.240 --> 28:55.240]  there's that little white part,
[28:55.240 --> 28:56.880]  the ceramic part at the base of the bulb,
[28:56.880 --> 28:59.320]  you can write the date right on there on the bulb.
[28:59.320 --> 29:00.960]  Or I've taken little stickers,
[29:00.960 --> 29:02.720]  just a little green yard sale sticker
[29:02.720 --> 29:04.560]  or a piece of duct tape or whatever,
[29:04.560 --> 29:06.480]  and write the date of that bulb on there
[29:06.480 --> 29:07.800]  and stick it to the reflector.
[29:07.800 --> 29:10.840]  Changed all these bulbs on 7-10-2018.
[29:10.840 --> 29:13.480]  Boom, stick that sticker right on the reflector,
[29:13.480 --> 29:14.680]  and then you've got some sort of note.
[29:14.680 --> 29:16.140]  But put it in your journal,
[29:16.140 --> 29:18.200]  that way you've got it all right there in one spot.
[29:18.200 --> 29:20.880]  Have some accountability, know when those bulbs were changed
[29:20.880 --> 29:22.680]  because bulbs don't last forever.
[29:22.680 --> 29:26.480]  Also, write down when you changed your carbon filters,
[29:26.480 --> 29:28.200]  your air conditioning filters.
[29:28.200 --> 29:30.000]  If you're running any kind of hydro,
[29:30.000 --> 29:31.880]  or also if you're running an RO system,
[29:31.880 --> 29:34.740]  write down when you changed those filters.
[29:34.740 --> 29:36.160]  Write that shit down in your journal
[29:36.160 --> 29:37.760]  so that it's never a question.
[29:37.760 --> 29:38.600]  So if somebody says,
[29:38.600 --> 29:40.520]  hey, how long have you had that fucking carbon filter?
[29:40.520 --> 29:41.640]  You can go, hold on, it's in my journal.
[29:41.640 --> 29:43.560]  You can scroll to the equipment page,
[29:43.560 --> 29:45.040]  and you can go, oh, I put that in here
[29:45.040 --> 29:48.320]  on the 4th of July in 2016.
[29:48.320 --> 29:50.640]  And go, okay, it's time to replace that fucker then.
[29:51.040 --> 29:53.200]  Just have some accountability with that.
[29:53.200 --> 29:55.280]  Also, I would recommend documenting
[29:55.280 --> 29:57.520]  when all of your meters are calibrated,
[29:57.520 --> 30:00.840]  your pH meter, your EC meter, your PPM meter,
[30:00.840 --> 30:02.760]  whatever type of meters you are using,
[30:02.760 --> 30:04.200]  calibrate those things.
[30:04.200 --> 30:07.700]  Make sure you calibrate them and write that down.
[30:07.700 --> 30:09.920]  Also, here's something you may not think about.
[30:09.920 --> 30:12.160]  Write down, if you're using a respirator
[30:12.160 --> 30:14.700]  when you apply pesticides, and you should be,
[30:14.700 --> 30:17.840]  write down when you changed those cartridges.
[30:17.840 --> 30:19.440]  The cartridges do not last forever.
[30:19.440 --> 30:21.200]  They've only got so many hours.
[30:21.200 --> 30:24.180]  Depending on what type of pesticide you are applying,
[30:24.180 --> 30:26.920]  the life of those cartridges can be shortened
[30:26.920 --> 30:28.160]  by different products.
[30:28.160 --> 30:30.600]  They don't last the same amount of time for each product.
[30:30.600 --> 30:32.200]  If you've got a more volatile product,
[30:32.200 --> 30:33.040]  I don't know the correct word,
[30:33.040 --> 30:35.080]  but if you've got a more dangerous product,
[30:35.080 --> 30:37.280]  then that cartridge is absorbing more junk,
[30:37.280 --> 30:39.080]  and it's not going to last as long.
[30:39.080 --> 30:42.200]  So write down each application that you have done
[30:42.200 --> 30:43.480]  with that cartridge,
[30:43.480 --> 30:45.920]  and when it was inserted into your respirator,
[30:45.920 --> 30:49.080]  and pay attention to when it needs to be replaced.
[30:49.720 --> 30:51.040]  Now, since we're talking about safety gear,
[30:51.040 --> 30:53.360]  let's write down the last time
[30:53.360 --> 30:55.040]  we checked our fire extinguisher.
[30:55.040 --> 30:56.920]  Have you checked the fire extinguisher lately?
[30:56.920 --> 30:58.200]  You should have one of those.
[30:58.200 --> 30:59.980]  Have you checked your smoke detector?
[30:59.980 --> 31:01.520]  You should have one of those.
[31:01.520 --> 31:03.260]  Check the batteries in your smoke detector,
[31:03.260 --> 31:06.160]  and write down the last time you tested it.
[31:06.160 --> 31:08.200]  That smoke detector won't do you any good
[31:08.200 --> 31:11.840]  if the batteries are dead, and it doesn't make any noise.
[31:11.840 --> 31:13.900]  All right, you guys, I feel like I have talked about
[31:13.900 --> 31:15.440]  a lot of stuff we could journal.
[31:15.440 --> 31:17.640]  How you want to journal, how you want to organize
[31:17.640 --> 31:20.120]  and arrange everything is up to you.
[31:20.120 --> 31:22.140]  I'm sure I've made my point of write down
[31:22.140 --> 31:23.800]  everything that you can.
[31:23.800 --> 31:25.400]  Now, let's say you see a problem.
[31:25.400 --> 31:27.600]  Let's say that you're walking into the grow room,
[31:27.600 --> 31:30.000]  and you see that in the middle of week six of flower,
[31:30.000 --> 31:33.080]  these plants just look like they have totally gone to shit.
[31:33.080 --> 31:35.160]  They're clawed up, some of the leaves are yellow,
[31:35.160 --> 31:37.820]  the leaves are facing down, they look like a claw,
[31:37.820 --> 31:40.440]  like a monster claw, and they're yellowed out.
[31:40.440 --> 31:41.820]  Oh crap, what happened?
[31:41.820 --> 31:43.460]  It's probably a nutrient problem.
[31:43.460 --> 31:47.080]  It's probably from about three to seven days ago.
[31:47.080 --> 31:48.200]  Let's get out the notebook.
[31:48.200 --> 31:50.760]  Let's scroll back and look to see what we did
[31:50.760 --> 31:51.580]  three days ago.
[31:51.580 --> 31:52.420]  What did we feed them?
[31:52.420 --> 31:53.240]  Anything weird?
[31:53.240 --> 31:54.400]  Let's look yesterday.
[31:54.400 --> 31:56.280]  Did we spray anything?
[31:56.280 --> 31:57.120]  Didn't spray anything.
[31:57.120 --> 31:57.940]  Let's look the day before.
[31:57.940 --> 31:58.780]  Did we spray anything?
[31:58.780 --> 31:59.600]  No spray.
[31:59.600 --> 32:00.440]  Let's look before that.
[32:00.440 --> 32:02.360]  Oh, here, we fed a whole bunch of stuff.
[32:02.360 --> 32:03.840]  Let's look through here.
[32:03.840 --> 32:06.060]  Okay, it doesn't seem to be like that's the problem.
[32:06.060 --> 32:06.920]  Let's look back.
[32:06.920 --> 32:09.500]  Okay, we started seeing that the runoff was different.
[32:09.500 --> 32:12.640]  The runoff, the pH of the runoff started getting really low,
[32:12.640 --> 32:15.040]  and the EC of the runoff started getting really high
[32:15.040 --> 32:16.660]  about seven days ago.
[32:17.180 --> 32:19.380]  What did we feed it about eight or nine days ago?
[32:19.380 --> 32:20.740]  And you can start doing that math,
[32:20.740 --> 32:24.180]  and you can say, oh shit, look, about 12 days ago,
[32:24.180 --> 32:26.460]  maybe 10 days ago, we fed this plant
[32:26.460 --> 32:28.340]  way too much of something,
[32:28.340 --> 32:31.100]  or we applied something that did it.
[32:31.100 --> 32:33.000]  And you'll just be able to use those notes
[32:33.000 --> 32:34.580]  as a map backwards.
[32:34.580 --> 32:36.660]  And now it has become a math problem,
[32:36.660 --> 32:38.360]  just to figure out through deductive reasoning
[32:38.360 --> 32:40.100]  with your notes what went wrong.
[32:40.100 --> 32:41.820]  And if you wrote enough notes,
[32:41.820 --> 32:43.700]  and you're paying enough attention to the plants,
[32:43.700 --> 32:45.680]  and you've got the connection that you need,
[32:45.680 --> 32:48.100]  you'll be able to find the problem.
[32:48.960 --> 32:50.200]  Then once you find that problem,
[32:50.200 --> 32:51.620]  write it down in your journal.
[32:51.620 --> 32:53.560]  Then when we grow OG Kush again,
[32:53.560 --> 32:55.000]  we know that in week five,
[32:55.000 --> 32:57.600]  not to try to feed it way too much bloom boosters.
[32:57.600 --> 33:00.360]  So this is what we call dialing in your grow.
[33:00.360 --> 33:02.480]  This is why a lot of experienced growers
[33:02.480 --> 33:04.680]  are sought after in commercial facilities.
[33:04.680 --> 33:06.600]  We can dial things in much more quickly
[33:06.600 --> 33:09.220]  because we're more familiar with these types of things.
[33:09.220 --> 33:11.240]  We know that some plants want some things.
[33:11.240 --> 33:13.080]  We know that some plants are gonna react certain ways,
[33:13.080 --> 33:15.620]  and we've got an eye to identify those things.
[33:16.460 --> 33:18.900]  And we develop that skill through taking notes,
[33:18.900 --> 33:20.740]  through practicing, through observation,
[33:20.740 --> 33:23.540]  and through repeating this process.
[33:23.540 --> 33:25.500]  Also, you guys, if you think about it,
[33:25.500 --> 33:27.340]  over several crop cycles,
[33:27.340 --> 33:29.180]  if you take good enough notes,
[33:29.180 --> 33:33.080]  you are reverse engineering SOPs for yourself.
[33:33.080 --> 33:35.980]  You are creating a standard operating procedure
[33:35.980 --> 33:36.820]  for your grow.
[33:36.820 --> 33:38.180]  You are dialing it in.
[33:38.180 --> 33:40.860]  You are starting to get a streamlined work process.
[33:40.860 --> 33:42.700]  You're starting to dial in the cost.
[33:42.700 --> 33:44.700]  You're starting to dial in the efficiency,
[33:44.700 --> 33:47.340]  and you can streamline it a little better every grow
[33:47.340 --> 33:49.620]  by taking notes and seeing exactly
[33:49.620 --> 33:51.280]  how much nutrient you're using,
[33:51.280 --> 33:53.180]  seeing each step that you're doing
[33:53.180 --> 33:54.980]  where you could kind of cut some time out
[33:54.980 --> 33:57.260]  by doing, oh, maybe I'm doing this wrong.
[33:57.260 --> 33:58.260]  You can save time here.
[33:58.260 --> 33:59.100]  You can save time here.
[33:59.100 --> 34:00.980]  You could save a few dollars here.
[34:00.980 --> 34:03.380]  You can learn how to not fuck up your crops.
[34:03.380 --> 34:05.140]  You can learn how to prevent problems.
[34:05.140 --> 34:07.380]  You can see which pesticide applications worked.
[34:07.380 --> 34:09.820]  You can see which pesticide applications did not work.
[34:09.820 --> 34:12.100]  You can see when to time things better.
[34:12.100 --> 34:14.500]  Keeping these notes will help you create
[34:15.260 --> 34:16.420]  a standard operating procedures
[34:16.420 --> 34:18.460]  that will work in a small-scale grow.
[34:18.460 --> 34:22.420]  It will also be expandable to a larger facility.
[34:23.300 --> 34:25.740]  Now, here's one last thing that we should keep notes of
[34:25.740 --> 34:29.100]  in any sort of grow situation, and that is your harvest.
[34:29.100 --> 34:31.260]  You want to keep notes on your harvest weights
[34:31.260 --> 34:34.020]  per plant, per strain, per room.
[34:34.020 --> 34:36.340]  However you want to do it, keep notes.
[34:36.340 --> 34:39.360]  Also, take personal notes on how you feel
[34:39.360 --> 34:41.580]  the quality is of your product.
[34:41.580 --> 34:44.060]  If you can get it lab tested, do that,
[34:44.060 --> 34:45.460]  and keep notes on that.
[34:45.460 --> 34:48.460]  That way we can see if we are increasing our harvest,
[34:48.460 --> 34:50.260]  increasing our quality.
[34:50.260 --> 34:53.540]  Also, document how many harvests you get per year,
[34:53.540 --> 34:56.660]  and let's see if we can maximize your room.
[34:56.660 --> 34:58.580]  Maybe if we time things properly,
[34:58.580 --> 35:01.660]  we can pull a whole other crop out of that room per year.
[35:01.660 --> 35:03.100]  Let's see what we can do for you.
[35:03.100 --> 35:05.580]  The only way we can do that is take notes
[35:05.580 --> 35:07.460]  and see if we can repeat our processes
[35:07.460 --> 35:09.740]  and see where we can improve, you guys.
[35:09.740 --> 35:12.900]  So that is my episode on journaling
[35:12.900 --> 35:14.460]  and keeping a grow journal.
[35:14.460 --> 35:15.580]  I hope you learned something.
[35:15.580 --> 35:17.340]  If you feel like there's something I missed
[35:17.340 --> 35:18.820]  that you would like to contribute,
[35:18.820 --> 35:21.420]  I would love to do an update episode.
[35:21.420 --> 35:22.380]  You can send me an email.
[35:22.380 --> 35:26.420]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[35:26.420 --> 35:28.860]  You know I love to hear from my listeners.
[35:28.860 --> 35:29.820]  Ladies and gentlemen, thanks again
[35:29.820 --> 35:31.420]  for listening to a long podcast.
[35:31.420 --> 35:35.220]  I would appreciate it if you support the podcast on Patreon.
[35:35.220 --> 35:38.060]  Patreon is a service that allows you as a listener
[35:38.060 --> 35:40.180]  to financially contribute to the podcast.
[35:40.180 --> 35:42.020]  What that would do is help me pay for the website
[35:42.060 --> 35:44.220]  that actually keeps this podcast free for everybody.
[35:44.220 --> 35:46.020]  It helps me cover the cost of this MacBook
[35:46.020 --> 35:48.020]  that I bought to keep the podcast coming to you.
[35:48.020 --> 35:50.260]  It helps me replace these little microphone covers
[35:50.260 --> 35:51.340]  so that when Mike comes over,
[35:51.340 --> 35:52.980]  he doesn't have to spit into the same mic cover
[35:52.980 --> 35:55.300]  that Granny was spitting into the whole episode.
[35:55.300 --> 35:57.140]  Small things like that do help me out.
[35:57.140 --> 35:58.460]  If you want more information,

[37:08.500 --> 37:09.420]  All right, podcast world.
[37:09.420 --> 37:10.740]  I know I ask for a lot of stuff
[37:10.740 --> 37:11.860]  at the end of every episode here.
[37:11.860 --> 37:13.260]  I'm like, go follow me on Patreon,
[37:13.260 --> 37:16.740]  go stalk me on social media, give me an iTunes review.
[37:16.740 --> 37:18.020]  There's all kinds of stuff I always ask for
[37:18.020 --> 37:20.500]  at the end of the show, but I would really appreciate it
[37:20.500 --> 37:23.980]  if we could get my strain Arise on Leafly.
[37:23.980 --> 37:26.100]  The way to do that is to go to Leafly
[37:26.100 --> 37:28.420]  and go to the submit a new strain tab
[37:28.420 --> 37:30.220]  and then just leave a review on Arise.
[37:30.220 --> 37:34.420]  If you have ever smoked, smelled, grown, consumed,
[37:34.420 --> 37:36.700]  anything about Arise and you feel like you're qualified
[37:36.700 --> 37:39.380]  to leave a review on there, I would appreciate that.
[37:39.380 --> 37:41.060]  Let's get Arise on Leafly.
[37:41.060 --> 37:44.780]  Go to leafly.com, go to the add a new strain tab.
[37:44.780 --> 37:46.260]  You may have to create an account.
[37:46.260 --> 37:47.900]  That's always fun.
[37:47.900 --> 37:49.580]  Then once you've got your account set up,
[37:49.580 --> 37:51.300]  go ahead and type in some information
[37:51.300 --> 37:52.820]  about my strain Arise.
[37:52.820 --> 37:54.940]  It is Golden Goat to Daybreaker.
[37:54.940 --> 37:58.340]  It is a hybrid and I think it deserves to be listed
[37:58.340 --> 37:59.820]  on the website Leafly.
[38:00.880 --> 38:01.940]  All right, you guys, I wanna thank you again
[38:01.940 --> 38:03.180]  for listening to this podcast.
[38:03.180 --> 38:04.540]  I'll be back in just a couple of days
[38:04.540 --> 38:06.540]  with fresh new content.
[38:07.380 --> 38:09.180]  I wanna give a huge shout out to my boy Max
[38:09.180 --> 38:11.200]  from TNT Extractions for keeping it real.
[38:11.200 --> 38:13.440]  So shout out to Max and until next time,
[38:13.440 --> 38:16.260]  take a fat dab and give your mama a hug for me.
[38:16.260 --> 38:17.100]  Thank you.
[38:19.100 --> 38:53.080]  Thank you.
[38:53.080 --> 38:54.780]  Thank you.
[38:54.780 --> 38:56.320]  Thank you.
[38:56.320 --> 38:57.160]  Thank you.
[38:57.160 --> 39:06.680]  Thank you.
[39:06.680 --> 39:07.500]  Thank you.
[39:07.500 --> 39:12.500]  Thank you.
[39:12.500 --> 39:13.340]  Thank you.
[39:13.340 --> 39:14.160]  Thank you.
[39:14.160 --> 39:15.000]  Thank you.
[39:15.000 --> 39:19.350]  Thank you.
[39:19.350 --> 39:20.270]  Thank you.
[39:20.270 --> 39:21.110]  Thank you.
[39:21.110 --> 39:21.950]  Thank you.
[39:21.950 --> 39:22.850]  Thank you.
