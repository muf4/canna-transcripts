[00:01.530 --> 00:04.850]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:04.850 --> 00:08.850]  It's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast, your source for cannabis
[00:08.850 --> 00:09.850]  news, education, and conversation.
[00:09.850 --> 00:14.850]  That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker
[00:14.850 --> 00:19.070]  or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who is just curious
[00:19.070 --> 00:23.290]  about the current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:23.290 --> 00:25.530]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:25.530 --> 00:28.650]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:28.650 --> 00:32.610]  This episode of the podcast is brought to you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:32.610 --> 00:36.990]  If you need new genetics for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:36.990 --> 00:40.450]  You can find them at dankseed.store.
[00:40.450 --> 00:44.610]  Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat joint, pack up the bong, or start heating up that
[00:44.610 --> 00:54.560]  dab rig because it's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:54.560 --> 00:55.720]  Welcome back, podcast world.
[00:55.720 --> 00:58.640]  It's time for episode 327 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:58.640 --> 00:59.640]  Thanks again for joining me.
[00:59.800 --> 01:02.920]  You know I like to start the episode off by letting you know what I'm smoking on.
[01:02.920 --> 01:09.440]  Today, I'm taking dabs of this New York City Diesel Ambrosia Batter from Apothecary Farms.
[01:09.440 --> 01:10.840]  I'm giving it a nice smell right now.
[01:10.840 --> 01:16.200]  This stuff smells like diesel fuel with a little bit of lemons, maybe a hint of oranges,
[01:16.200 --> 01:20.320]  and then there's kind of a sweet tart sort of smell on top of it that I really enjoy.
[01:20.320 --> 01:25.360]  One thing about the New York City Diesel Ambrosia Batter here that I'm smoking on, my eyes really
[01:25.360 --> 01:26.480]  don't get red when I smoke.
[01:26.480 --> 01:30.360]  I can smoke and I don't get red-eyed, but when I take one dab of this New York City
[01:30.360 --> 01:33.040]  Diesel, my eyes go fully bloodshot red.
[01:33.040 --> 01:35.440]  I'm not sure what does it, but I get super red.
[01:35.440 --> 01:38.560]  I get super head high from it, and I really enjoy it.
[01:38.560 --> 01:43.480]  If that weren't enough, I've been adding this Sour Amnesia High Cannabinoid Full Spectrum
[01:43.480 --> 01:48.400]  Extract into the mix, and it just adds a really nice ... It's like turbocharging my dab.
[01:48.400 --> 01:49.400]  It is really nice.
[01:49.400 --> 01:52.280]  I like the lung expansion and the flavor from the New York City Diesel.
[01:52.680 --> 01:56.720]  Then you put the High Cannabinoid Full Spectrum Extract on top, and it really makes it like
[01:56.720 --> 01:58.860]  a turbocharged dab.
[01:58.860 --> 01:59.860]  I'm in the mood for a podcast.
[01:59.860 --> 02:01.240]  You guys, I feel super rambly.
[02:01.240 --> 02:03.120]  I feel like I got a lot of energy.
[02:03.120 --> 02:04.840]  Let's get into a podcast.
[02:04.840 --> 02:08.840]  This episode is going to be all about trimming your cannabis plants.
[02:08.840 --> 02:09.840]  That's right.
[02:09.840 --> 02:10.840]  We've learned how to tell when the plants are ripe.
[02:10.840 --> 02:12.360]  We've learned how to cut them down.
[02:12.360 --> 02:13.440]  We've learned how to harvest them.
[02:13.440 --> 02:15.600]  We learned how to hang them until they're ready to snap.
[02:15.600 --> 02:17.600]  We know pretty well how to dry and cure.
[02:17.600 --> 02:20.120]  Now let's talk about trimming our plants.
[02:20.960 --> 02:22.480]  Now there are two different ways you can trim.
[02:22.480 --> 02:24.640]  There's wet trim, and there is dry trim.
[02:24.640 --> 02:26.960]  I definitely prefer dry trim.
[02:26.960 --> 02:29.640]  Now you're going to say, why is dry trim better?
[02:29.640 --> 02:35.840]  I think dry trim is better because it's less sticky, and it's much easier to work with.
[02:35.840 --> 02:37.560]  It's also less work.
[02:37.560 --> 02:38.920]  The leaves are dry.
[02:38.920 --> 02:40.000]  Those leaves are going to fall off.
[02:40.000 --> 02:43.120]  All you have to do is just brush them with your thumb, maybe touch them with the scissors,
[02:43.120 --> 02:45.820]  and those brittle leaves will come right off of there.
[02:45.820 --> 02:49.260]  The buds have dried and tightened up, and it's a little more obvious for a new trimmer
[02:49.380 --> 02:50.380]  what to take off.
[02:50.380 --> 02:53.340]  You just want to take off that fluffy outside shit.
[02:53.340 --> 02:54.340]  It's a little less work.
[02:54.340 --> 02:59.740]  It's less sticky, and there's also less chance to ruin your buds by improperly storing them.
[02:59.740 --> 03:03.100]  A lot of people, once the buds are trimmed, if they wet trim, they like to just shove
[03:03.100 --> 03:07.340]  them into a container or a package, and then those wet buds go into a container, and that's
[03:07.340 --> 03:09.080]  when they get ruined.
[03:09.080 --> 03:10.340]  We're not even going to let that happen.
[03:10.340 --> 03:13.460]  We're going to let the buds dry, then we're going to trim them, then we'll put them in
[03:13.460 --> 03:14.460]  a container.
[03:14.460 --> 03:17.380]  Now a lot of people have listened to the dry and curing episode.
[03:17.380 --> 03:21.280]  You may be trimming these buds before they go into the jar for cure.
[03:21.280 --> 03:24.180]  You may be trimming these buds after they've been in the cure jar for a little while.
[03:24.180 --> 03:25.260]  It's all the same process.
[03:25.260 --> 03:27.580]  The leaves should be similar in dryness.
[03:27.580 --> 03:29.340]  They should just be popping right off of there.
[03:29.340 --> 03:31.740]  You might not even need scissors for this.
[03:31.740 --> 03:35.140]  Sometimes when I'm dry trimming, the only thing I use my scissors for is for cutting
[03:35.140 --> 03:38.820]  the plant into smaller pieces, and cutting the sticks out, and cutting the bigger buds
[03:38.820 --> 03:41.020]  down to smaller buds.
[03:41.020 --> 03:45.280]  Now let's talk about a few preparations we can make and a few items we can have to create
[03:45.280 --> 03:48.880]  a comfortable and successful trim environment for ourselves.
[03:48.880 --> 03:49.880]  Trimming sucks.
[03:49.880 --> 03:51.120]  It's going to take a long time.
[03:51.120 --> 03:55.480]  You're sitting in a chair with your elbows up high, staring straight into something for
[03:55.480 --> 03:56.480]  a long time.
[03:56.480 --> 04:01.000]  Your neck, your elbows, your eyes, your back, that stuff all gets sore and tired.
[04:01.000 --> 04:04.320]  So let's try to make it as comfortable as possible.
[04:04.320 --> 04:05.840]  I like to have a nice clean space.
[04:05.840 --> 04:07.640]  I've got this table where I like to do my work.
[04:07.640 --> 04:09.040]  I clean the whole table off.
[04:09.040 --> 04:12.820]  There's nothing on the table except my Dr. Pepper and some trim supplies.
[04:12.820 --> 04:14.680]  Maybe my phone for some entertainment.
[04:14.680 --> 04:15.680]  It's just there for music.
[04:15.680 --> 04:16.680]  I'm not going to be touching it.
[04:16.680 --> 04:18.160]  Don't have your phone out if you're trimming.
[04:18.160 --> 04:20.240]  It's so fucking distracting and it will slow you down.
[04:20.240 --> 04:21.240]  It will take twice as long.
[04:21.240 --> 04:24.080]  Put on a podcast, hit play, start fucking trimming.
[04:24.080 --> 04:25.920]  Anyway, I like to have the table nice and clean.
[04:25.920 --> 04:27.200]  I don't need shit in my way.
[04:27.200 --> 04:31.480]  I need maybe my scissors for cutting my buds into smaller pieces, and then just a few basic
[04:31.480 --> 04:33.200]  essentials, and we'll talk about those.
[04:33.200 --> 04:34.400]  A nice clean space.
[04:34.400 --> 04:36.600]  I also like a nice comfortable chair.
[04:36.600 --> 04:38.300]  You're going to be sitting there for a while.
[04:38.300 --> 04:39.840]  Get a cozy chair.
[04:39.840 --> 04:43.680]  So a nice clean workspace and a cozy chair are super important for me for trimming, but
[04:43.680 --> 04:46.040]  then you need some sort of entertainment.
[04:46.040 --> 04:47.880]  Hopefully you got somebody there to talk to.
[04:47.880 --> 04:50.400]  Usually I got Mike or somebody around to bullshit with.
[04:50.400 --> 04:54.680]  Some sort of conversation makes trimming go much more smoothly, but if you don't have
[04:54.680 --> 04:56.360]  that option, put on a podcast.
[04:56.360 --> 04:57.800]  You guys, I like to put on a podcast.
[04:57.800 --> 05:01.200]  Of course, I recommend old episodes of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[05:01.200 --> 05:03.240]  Put on some Joe Rogan, something like that.
[05:03.240 --> 05:04.720]  Maybe a YouTube video.
[05:04.720 --> 05:08.160]  Something to entertain yourself to listen to, but nothing to look at.
[05:08.160 --> 05:11.640]  Back in the day, we used to trim all around the TV and we would watch YouTube videos and
[05:11.640 --> 05:12.640]  trim.
[05:12.640 --> 05:15.600]  If you're a person that is super distracting, don't watch videos.
[05:15.600 --> 05:18.360]  People will put their fucking scissors down and you'll catch them just watching TV.
[05:18.360 --> 05:21.360]  If you're paying people to trim, don't have a TV in the room.
[05:21.360 --> 05:23.960]  Podcasts, maybe some standup comedy.
[05:23.960 --> 05:26.800]  It's hard to get everybody on the same page when it comes to music, but maybe play some
[05:26.800 --> 05:27.920]  good music.
[05:27.920 --> 05:31.360]  Just some sort of stuff to make it comfortable and help the time pass without your brain
[05:31.360 --> 05:33.160]  going crazy is what I'm getting at, you guys.
[05:33.160 --> 05:34.160]  So you got a clean space.
[05:34.160 --> 05:35.160]  You got a chair to sit in.
[05:35.160 --> 05:36.440]  You got a good YouTube video on.
[05:36.440 --> 05:37.440]  You got a podcast going.
[05:37.440 --> 05:38.480]  So now you're cozy.
[05:38.480 --> 05:39.480]  Your mind is entertained.
[05:39.480 --> 05:41.080]  Now you need some gloves.
[05:41.080 --> 05:42.720]  Put some rubber gloves on.
[05:42.720 --> 05:44.160]  You want to wear gloves when you're trimming.
[05:44.160 --> 05:46.840]  You're going to get extremely sticky.
[05:46.840 --> 05:49.800]  You don't want to have to itch your face and have to go wash your hands just to scratch
[05:49.800 --> 05:51.000]  your face.
[05:51.000 --> 05:54.400]  You're going to be, your hands are going to be covered in trichomes and resin, you guys.
[05:54.400 --> 05:55.400]  Wear gloves.
[05:55.400 --> 05:57.160]  Also, you need some good scissors.
[05:57.160 --> 06:01.400]  I like the little tiny Fiskars diamond tip scissors that you get.
[06:01.400 --> 06:02.640]  They're expensive at the grocery store.
[06:02.640 --> 06:03.840]  They're cheaper at Hobby Lobby.
[06:03.840 --> 06:05.480]  They sell them in the craft section.
[06:05.480 --> 06:06.840]  Right in the craft section at Hobby Lobby.
[06:06.840 --> 06:07.840]  That's all of Hobby Lobby.
[06:07.840 --> 06:09.560]  They sell them in the fabric section.
[06:09.560 --> 06:10.560]  Buy the fabric.
[06:10.560 --> 06:13.480]  They're Fiskars diamond tip titanium scissors.
[06:13.480 --> 06:15.000]  I really like those.
[06:15.000 --> 06:16.280]  They work really well for trimming.
[06:16.280 --> 06:17.280]  They're super light.
[06:17.280 --> 06:19.920]  Get something with a spring in it that opens on its own because you don't want to have
[06:19.920 --> 06:21.840]  to be opening and closing scissors.
[06:21.840 --> 06:24.320]  You don't want the kind of scissors that have loops that go around your fingers because
[06:24.320 --> 06:25.800]  you're going to be cutting for so long.
[06:25.800 --> 06:28.340]  Those little loops around your fingers are going to dig into you.
[06:28.340 --> 06:31.880]  You just want lightweight, super fast trimming shears.
[06:31.880 --> 06:33.760]  They're easy to find and they're affordable.
[06:33.760 --> 06:37.480]  Maybe get yourselves two pair so that you can set one in the rubbing alcohol to clean
[06:37.480 --> 06:38.480]  off.
[06:38.480 --> 06:41.160]  You can pick up another pair, swap them out real quick, not have to spend a lot of time
[06:41.160 --> 06:42.840]  cleaning your scissors.
[06:42.840 --> 06:44.880]  You need some good gloves, some good scissors.
[06:44.880 --> 06:46.920]  Then you need some containers.
[06:46.920 --> 06:49.000]  You need a container for untrimmed buds.
[06:49.000 --> 06:52.080]  I recommend a five gallon bucket for the untrimmed buds.
[06:52.080 --> 06:53.420]  Maybe you don't have that much herb.
[06:53.420 --> 06:55.160]  Maybe something smaller will work.
[06:55.160 --> 06:57.960]  Then you need another container for trimmed buds.
[06:57.960 --> 07:01.120]  Then you need another container for saveable trim.
[07:01.120 --> 07:03.520]  Then we need another container for waste.
[07:03.520 --> 07:08.000]  You need trimmed buds, untrimmed buds, usable trim, and waste.
[07:08.000 --> 07:10.400]  A couple of the things I'm going to recommend and you're going to say, why the hell would
[07:10.400 --> 07:12.000]  he recommend this for a grow?
[07:12.000 --> 07:15.960]  I would recommend either some coconut oil or some baby oil for your trim session.
[07:15.960 --> 07:18.120]  You're going to say, why do we need that?
[07:18.120 --> 07:19.400]  Here is why.
[07:19.400 --> 07:23.440]  When your fingers and hands and arms get all sticky, you can use the coconut oil or the
[07:23.440 --> 07:25.520]  baby oil to remove the trichomes.
[07:25.520 --> 07:26.520]  That's right.
[07:26.520 --> 07:29.320]  If your hands are all covered in resin, my thing is that my arms get covered in resin
[07:29.320 --> 07:30.600]  because I'm the one cutting down the plants.
[07:30.600 --> 07:32.940]  I'm reaching in there and playing with them and carrying them around.
[07:32.940 --> 07:36.680]  My arm hair and shit gets all coated in trichomes and plant resin.
[07:36.760 --> 07:40.880]  I use the coconut oil or baby oil to just rub up on my arms and rub that shit right
[07:40.880 --> 07:44.960]  off and all the resin comes right off and then you're not all sticky.
[07:44.960 --> 07:48.760]  That's a basic breakdown of things that you're going to need for your trim session.
[07:48.760 --> 07:50.540]  You need a nice clean space in which to work.
[07:50.540 --> 07:52.440]  You need a nice cozy chair in which to sit.
[07:52.440 --> 07:56.160]  You need a good podcast to listen to, probably the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[07:56.160 --> 07:57.160]  Then you need some gloves.
[07:57.160 --> 07:58.160]  You need scissors.
[07:58.160 --> 07:59.160]  Then you need your containers.
[07:59.160 --> 08:00.640]  Then you've got your cleanup supplies.
[08:00.640 --> 08:03.000]  Now let's talk about doing the manual work.
[08:03.000 --> 08:07.960]  Hopefully, a few days before harvest, you went in and did a pre-harvest defoliation.
[08:07.960 --> 08:12.080]  What I mean by that is while the plants are still alive, while you're flushing, anywhere
[08:12.080 --> 08:16.600]  between seven days before harvest up to the day of harvest, you can go in there and just
[08:16.600 --> 08:19.360]  start pulling off all of the big leaves.
[08:19.360 --> 08:20.480]  The plants are done growing.
[08:20.480 --> 08:21.480]  They're just flushing out.
[08:21.480 --> 08:22.480]  They're just finishing up.
[08:22.480 --> 08:23.480]  The trichomes are ripening up.
[08:23.480 --> 08:25.440]  You don't need all that excess leaf in there.
[08:25.440 --> 08:28.400]  Just go ahead and tear all that leaf out of the room.
[08:28.400 --> 08:32.400]  Having a pre-harvest defoliation session will save you a lot of time when it comes time
[08:32.400 --> 08:37.080]  to trim because all of that long, straggly leaf is already gone.
[08:37.080 --> 08:38.160]  It's not even there to deal with.
[08:38.160 --> 08:39.320]  It's already been removed.
[08:39.320 --> 08:42.600]  It will also help your drying and curing time.
[08:42.600 --> 08:45.440]  Go in and pull off all the big leaves before you harvest.
[08:45.440 --> 08:46.440]  Then it's harvest time.
[08:46.440 --> 08:48.780]  I've done a highly detailed harvest episode.
[08:48.780 --> 08:52.780]  If you haven't listened to that, go listen to that, then come catch up.
[08:52.780 --> 08:56.920]  At the end of the harvest episode, we're left with our plants hanging upside down in a controlled
[08:56.920 --> 08:57.920]  environment.
[08:57.920 --> 09:00.640]  Now we want those plants to get to where the sticks snap.
[09:00.640 --> 09:03.800]  Once the sticks get snappy, you can start trimming.
[09:03.800 --> 09:07.560]  You can also start trimming them after they've been in their cure containers for a little
[09:07.560 --> 09:08.560]  while.
[09:08.560 --> 09:09.560]  I like dry trim.
[09:09.560 --> 09:13.680]  I'm just waiting for the buds to be dry enough to where the leaves just flake right off.
[09:13.680 --> 09:15.560]  There's still going to be moisture inside those buds.
[09:15.560 --> 09:19.000]  There's moisture in the middle, but the outside is dry enough to where you can just knock
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.640]  the leaves off the buds with your thumb.
[09:21.640 --> 09:25.200]  I'm making a little motion with my hands that sort of looks like I'm playing a video game.
[09:25.200 --> 09:28.540]  I've got a game controller in my hand, but my hands are really close together.
[09:28.540 --> 09:32.620]  In my mind, I'm just holding that little bud with my forefingers or maybe with my left
[09:32.620 --> 09:36.860]  hand and I'm just knocking the leaves off with my right hand.
[09:36.860 --> 09:39.060]  Just like I'm just, it looks like I'm playing a video game.
[09:39.060 --> 09:41.660]  I'm just holding the bud and just rubbing the leaves right off.
[09:41.660 --> 09:45.180]  If you hold it with the bud facing up, if you rub down, those leaves will just rub right
[09:45.180 --> 09:46.180]  off.
[09:46.180 --> 09:47.860]  You'll see what I'm talking about when you figure out the technique.
[09:47.860 --> 09:49.820]  You go, man, that is so easy.
[09:49.820 --> 09:52.420]  So my point is that I want it to where the buds are dry.
[09:52.420 --> 09:54.220]  I want to be able to just knock those leaves right off.
[09:54.220 --> 09:57.820]  So here is how I actually do my trimming.
[09:57.820 --> 09:59.860]  Whenever I'm working with the plants, I like to wear gloves.
[09:59.860 --> 10:02.780]  So step one of trimming is put on some rubber gloves.
[10:02.780 --> 10:04.780]  I like the six millimeter nitrile gloves.
[10:04.780 --> 10:05.780]  I don't care if they're black.
[10:05.780 --> 10:06.940]  I don't care if they're blue.
[10:06.940 --> 10:09.260]  I just care that they fit and that they're comfortable.
[10:09.260 --> 10:10.260]  So glove up.
[10:10.260 --> 10:14.520]  I don't want to get all sticky and also I don't want to get my skin all over the buds.
[10:14.520 --> 10:16.340]  So step one is glove up.
[10:16.340 --> 10:21.220]  Step two of trimming is to knock all of the buds off of the sticks into a five gallon
[10:21.220 --> 10:22.220]  bucket.
[10:22.220 --> 10:23.400]  This makes it so much easier.
[10:23.400 --> 10:28.040]  Just go and get every bud off the sticks into a bucket and then discard all the sticks.
[10:28.040 --> 10:31.280]  Now you've compressed your work into a much smaller space.
[10:31.280 --> 10:34.720]  It looks way less overwhelming and you can see what you've got ahead of you.
[10:34.720 --> 10:38.200]  You've got a five gallon bucket filled with buds that you need to trim.
[10:38.200 --> 10:42.180]  It doesn't look like this big sprawl of branches and leaves and shit everywhere.
[10:42.180 --> 10:43.180]  Just a bucket.
[10:43.180 --> 10:45.140]  It's way less intimidating and you can get through it.
[10:45.140 --> 10:48.400]  So knock all the buds into a bucket.
[10:48.400 --> 10:50.040]  Maybe you can use just a small bowl.
[10:50.040 --> 10:51.400]  Maybe you can use something smaller.
[10:51.400 --> 10:52.740]  I'm not sure how much you grew.
[10:52.740 --> 10:53.740]  Maybe you need five buckets.
[10:53.740 --> 10:57.700]  I hope you need 10 or 25 gallon buckets, but find the container that's the right size for
[10:57.700 --> 10:58.700]  what you need.
[10:58.700 --> 11:03.220]  A five gallon bucket from Home Depot or Lowe's is really affordable and they're disposable.
[11:03.220 --> 11:05.140]  So I like to use the buckets.
[11:05.140 --> 11:08.140]  So I knock every bud into a bucket.
[11:08.140 --> 11:10.420]  Now I've got a five gallon bucket full of buds.
[11:10.420 --> 11:15.300]  My next step is just to reach in, grab the bud off the top and start trimming.
[11:15.300 --> 11:18.820]  Now I'll actually start talking about trimming a little bit and the actual trimming of the
[11:18.820 --> 11:20.260]  bud process.
[11:20.260 --> 11:24.980]  The idea is to knock or cut off all of the excessive leaves and stems and give yourself
[11:24.980 --> 11:28.600]  a nice, pretty, presentable bud.
[11:28.600 --> 11:30.660]  You guys know what a good trimmed bud looks like.
[11:30.660 --> 11:32.780]  When they start off, they're covered in leaves.
[11:32.780 --> 11:35.180]  It's our job to knock those leaves off.
[11:35.180 --> 11:36.460]  We don't want to smoke leaves.
[11:36.460 --> 11:38.020]  Leaves contain chlorophyll.
[11:38.020 --> 11:39.260]  Leaves don't taste good.
[11:39.260 --> 11:40.660]  Leaves don't get you high.
[11:40.660 --> 11:44.580]  What we want is a nice, frosty, green nugget.
[11:44.580 --> 11:48.860]  So once you guys get started trimming, you'll see what's leaf material and what is a usable
[11:48.860 --> 11:49.860]  bud.
[11:49.860 --> 11:51.740]  If you guys start digging in there and just start knocking off some of the leaf, you'll
[11:51.740 --> 11:55.860]  find that bud in the middle and it will start to become very obvious what you do and do
[11:55.860 --> 11:57.140]  not trim.
[11:57.140 --> 12:00.660]  If your buds are kind of airy and fluffy, don't trim too deeply.
[12:00.660 --> 12:02.140]  Just knock off the leaves.
[12:02.140 --> 12:05.820]  I like to grab the bud by the base, by that little stick at the bottom of the bud, and
[12:05.820 --> 12:07.860]  just use my thumb to push the leaves off.
[12:07.860 --> 12:10.820]  I just kind of spin the bud in a circle with my left hand.
[12:10.820 --> 12:11.820]  I will turn it.
[12:11.820 --> 12:12.820]  I'm looking, that's counterclockwise.
[12:12.820 --> 12:13.820]  No, that is clockwise.
[12:13.820 --> 12:17.980]  I'll turn the bud clockwise and as it comes toward me, I'll use my right thumb.
[12:17.980 --> 12:22.460]  I'm using my left hand to spin the bud toward me and as that one side comes toward me, my
[12:22.460 --> 12:24.660]  thumb just knocks the leaves off right there.
[12:24.660 --> 12:27.780]  I'm just wiping them off like I'm just scraping the leaves off.
[12:27.780 --> 12:30.220]  They're so dry that they knock off on their own.
[12:30.220 --> 12:33.840]  And don't press so hard that you're fucking up the shape of the bud and knocking off trichomes.
[12:33.840 --> 12:35.500]  You can do this really gently.
[12:35.500 --> 12:37.980]  You'll find the technique after you do it a few times.
[12:37.980 --> 12:40.660]  It'll be really comfortable and you'll get really fast at it.
[12:40.660 --> 12:42.380]  A lot of people like to do this with scissors.
[12:42.380 --> 12:45.820]  They'll hold it in their left hand and they'll take their scissors and just turn it and trim
[12:45.820 --> 12:46.820]  it.
[12:46.820 --> 12:48.140]  It's like taking off horizontally.
[12:48.140 --> 12:49.860]  Just keep your scissors horizontal.
[12:49.860 --> 12:53.520]  You can adjust your angle as you need and just spin that bud and keep cutting.
[12:53.520 --> 12:54.580]  Just like you're giving it a haircut.
[12:54.580 --> 12:57.500]  You just want to take off those leaves and leave that bud there.
[12:57.500 --> 12:59.660]  So just knock off the leaves.
[12:59.660 --> 13:03.180]  Don't carve too deeply into the buds and don't squish the buds while you're trimming them.
[13:03.180 --> 13:06.300]  Don't squeeze them super hard and try not to handle them too much.
[13:06.300 --> 13:08.420]  A little tiny bud doesn't need a lot of handling.
[13:08.420 --> 13:10.800]  You don't want to get all those trichomes on your gloves.
[13:10.800 --> 13:13.500]  You want to leave the trichomes on the buds.
[13:13.500 --> 13:14.740]  You can use scissors if you want.
[13:14.740 --> 13:16.980]  I like my thumbs for most trimming.
[13:16.980 --> 13:19.860]  The little edge of my thumb and my thumbnail is a perfect little trimmer for me.
[13:19.860 --> 13:21.780]  I've mastered that technique.
[13:21.780 --> 13:25.180]  I knock off the little leaves and cut the big buds into smaller sizes.
[13:25.180 --> 13:29.340]  If you guys can see a stick in there and it's like one bud and then a little stick and another
[13:29.340 --> 13:30.420]  bud, take that shit out.
[13:30.420 --> 13:32.420]  Nobody wants to buy a stick.
[13:32.420 --> 13:35.780]  Connoisseur quality bud is taken down to the small part.
[13:35.780 --> 13:38.860]  If you want to leave your buds in big buds, that's fine.
[13:38.860 --> 13:40.340]  It's up to you.
[13:40.340 --> 13:41.660]  I like them smaller.
[13:41.660 --> 13:43.460]  A lot of people don't want to buy a big stick.
[13:44.460 --> 13:46.260]  You'll have some customers that want big buds.
[13:46.260 --> 13:49.540]  I used to have people that just wanted big buds and then some people know better.
[13:49.540 --> 13:53.500]  They're like, man, I don't want to buy that quarter, that one bud that weighs a quarter
[13:53.500 --> 13:56.820]  because I know right up the middle of it is a gram of stick and I'm getting ripped off.
[13:56.820 --> 13:58.780]  Some people want it, some people don't.
[13:58.780 --> 14:01.020]  That's up to you.
[14:01.020 --> 14:06.020]  Once you've got it trimmed up to the size you want it and the amount of trim you want,
[14:06.020 --> 14:09.180]  I cut off all the little leaves at the bottom also.
[14:09.180 --> 14:11.460]  A lot of people leave little cabbage-y looking leaves at the bottom.
[14:11.460 --> 14:12.820]  I cut that shit off.
[14:12.820 --> 14:13.820]  I call it cabbage.
[14:13.820 --> 14:16.140]  I also take out the handlebar sticks.
[14:16.140 --> 14:19.780]  On the bottom you're going to have the branch that the bud was actually stuck to the branch
[14:19.780 --> 14:20.780]  to.
[14:20.780 --> 14:23.100]  Then there's two little sticks that come out that those first leaves were attached to and
[14:23.100 --> 14:24.500]  they're all dry and shitty looking.
[14:24.500 --> 14:25.780]  Cut those off of there.
[14:25.780 --> 14:30.180]  If you've got a pound of weed and you've got all those little tiny sticks in there, those
[14:30.180 --> 14:32.020]  little sticks make your pound look like shit.
[14:32.020 --> 14:34.140]  Just take it out and your pound is going to look so much better.
[14:34.140 --> 14:35.940]  It's going to be so much more desirable.
[14:35.940 --> 14:37.860]  It's going to get you more money.
[14:37.860 --> 14:38.860]  That's the bottom line here.
[14:38.860 --> 14:40.940]  Trim it and it's worth more money.
[14:40.940 --> 14:42.260]  Take off all the leaves.
[14:42.260 --> 14:44.100]  Take off that little stick at the bottom.
[14:44.100 --> 14:45.260]  Knock off all the crow's feet.
[14:45.260 --> 14:49.300]  If you've got a little tiny pointy leaf sticking out of somewhere, cut that out or knock it
[14:49.300 --> 14:50.380]  off with your thumb.
[14:50.380 --> 14:52.780]  Those little triangle leaves make you look lazy.
[14:52.780 --> 14:56.100]  If you did a whole good job on most of the bud and you just left one or two little triangles
[14:56.100 --> 14:57.980]  at the tip, you look lazy.
[14:57.980 --> 15:00.140]  Take that stuff out of there.
[15:00.140 --> 15:04.420]  While I'm doing this, all the trimming work, I trim over a tray or a container to catch
[15:04.420 --> 15:05.780]  what I trim off.
[15:05.780 --> 15:09.820]  All that little stuff that gets clipped off is going to be used to make concentrates or
[15:09.820 --> 15:12.060]  edibles in the future.
[15:12.060 --> 15:13.340]  Gather all that stuff up.
[15:13.340 --> 15:14.340]  Take care of it.
[15:14.340 --> 15:16.620]  Don't just trim into the floor and then sweep it up.
[15:16.620 --> 15:18.460]  Don't trim onto the table and then scoop it up.
[15:18.460 --> 15:19.460]  Trim onto a tray.
[15:19.460 --> 15:22.960]  Trim into a container so that it is kept clean so it's treated with respect because it may
[15:22.960 --> 15:24.700]  go into edibles.
[15:24.700 --> 15:27.740]  Things that you're going to eat need to be treated with respect.
[15:27.740 --> 15:30.020]  Things you're going to smoke need to be treated with respect.
[15:30.020 --> 15:31.620]  This is our medicine.
[15:31.620 --> 15:33.660]  Gather this stuff up and vacuum seal it.
[15:33.660 --> 15:38.180]  I like to keep the trim in a vacuum sealed bag in the dark until I'm able to use it.
[15:38.180 --> 15:41.140]  Get that to your extractor as soon as you can.
[15:41.220 --> 15:43.460]  The sticks, those are thrown away.
[15:43.460 --> 15:45.140]  I throw all the sticks away.
[15:45.140 --> 15:46.940]  In a commercial grow they're thrown away.
[15:46.940 --> 15:50.780]  In a home grow, those should go to the compost pile or they could be burned or something.
[15:50.780 --> 15:52.780]  But the sticks are trash.
[15:52.780 --> 15:54.620]  Don't try to extract sticks, you guys.
[15:54.620 --> 15:55.620]  That's a waste of time.
[15:55.620 --> 15:56.700]  It's a waste of energy.
[15:56.700 --> 15:58.500]  You're not going to get anything out of it.
[15:58.500 --> 16:02.940]  And also if you're adding the sticks to the trim, you're just making the hash worse.
[16:02.940 --> 16:05.600]  You're not making it better.
[16:05.600 --> 16:08.980]  What goes in comes out and if you just put shit in to make more, you're going to get
[16:08.980 --> 16:10.620]  more but it's going to be shit.
[16:10.620 --> 16:17.260]  So gather up all your trim, vacuum seal the trim, keep the trim in a dark place and get
[16:17.260 --> 16:20.540]  that to somebody that can turn that into concentrates for you.
[16:20.540 --> 16:26.180]  Also, if you've got like yellow or brown or funky leaves that are falling off as you're
[16:26.180 --> 16:27.380]  trimming, separate those.
[16:27.380 --> 16:28.860]  Pull those out of the trim.
[16:28.860 --> 16:30.540]  Don't send that to the extractor.
[16:30.540 --> 16:31.960]  That's going to make your hash dark.
[16:31.960 --> 16:33.700]  It's going to make your hash taste like shit.
[16:33.700 --> 16:36.580]  It's going to make it less potent and it's going to make it less desirable.
[16:36.580 --> 16:41.740]  So do a little work, clean it up, get it out of there and you will have a better product.
[16:41.740 --> 16:45.520]  So use your thumbs or some scissors to gently remove the excess leaves and the little stems
[16:45.520 --> 16:46.520]  from the buds.
[16:46.520 --> 16:47.520]  Get rid of the handlebars.
[16:47.520 --> 16:48.700]  Get rid of the crow's feet.
[16:48.700 --> 16:53.620]  Now once the buds are trimmed to your satisfaction, you can place them into a container for finished
[16:53.620 --> 16:54.620]  products.
[16:54.620 --> 16:57.900]  Now when I say to your satisfaction, how you want to trim your buds is up to you.
[16:57.900 --> 17:00.020]  If you want to leave it a little fluffy, go for it.
[17:00.020 --> 17:02.420]  If you want to trim it nice and tight, go for it.
[17:02.420 --> 17:04.540]  That is up to you.
[17:04.540 --> 17:08.340]  If your product is for you personally, then you can leave it as leafy as you want.
[17:08.340 --> 17:10.680]  You can knock those leaves off right before you smoke it.
[17:10.680 --> 17:11.980]  You can clean it up yourself.
[17:11.980 --> 17:16.180]  If you plan on getting top dollar for your product, you'll need to have a tight, clean
[17:16.180 --> 17:17.800]  trim job.
[17:17.800 --> 17:21.260]  One thing I should mention that will help us speed up the process of trimming is the
[17:21.260 --> 17:22.260]  rule of thumb.
[17:22.260 --> 17:26.140]  If the bud you are trimming is not bigger than the tip of your thumb, it's probably
[17:26.140 --> 17:30.740]  better to let that bud go to your hash pile and trim something more substantial.
[17:30.740 --> 17:34.460]  Put those little popcorn buds in the hash pile, put it in your trim pile, and you can
[17:34.460 --> 17:37.580]  make better hash that will improve the quality of your concentrate.
[17:37.580 --> 17:40.300]  So if it's a little tiny bud, don't waste time trimming it.
[17:40.300 --> 17:42.140]  Just throw it in the hash pile.
[17:42.140 --> 17:44.140]  And don't waste your time trimming little tiny buds.
[17:44.140 --> 17:48.720]  If you feel like that little tiny bud is worth less money than the time it is taking you
[17:48.720 --> 17:51.700]  to trim it, set it aside and put it in the hash pile.
[17:51.700 --> 17:53.220]  You don't have to trim that.
[17:53.220 --> 17:59.620]  If herb costs $10 a gram and it takes you like a minute to trim that little nug, it's
[17:59.620 --> 18:00.620]  not cost effective.
[18:00.700 --> 18:02.820]  So toss that little nug into the trim bin.
[18:02.820 --> 18:04.140]  We'll add that to the concentrates.
[18:04.140 --> 18:08.340]  Grab something that we can trim and get on the shelf and make it purchasable for the
[18:08.340 --> 18:09.420]  consumer.
[18:09.420 --> 18:12.380]  So if it's real tiny, if it's ugly, don't bother trimming it.
[18:12.380 --> 18:14.500]  You can put that in your hash pile.
[18:14.500 --> 18:19.340]  You can add that to the to be extracted pile and that will just improve your concentrates.
[18:19.340 --> 18:20.820]  It will also speed you up.
[18:20.820 --> 18:25.420]  Of course, if you need every little half gram, every piece of gravel out of that crop to
[18:25.420 --> 18:28.300]  make your goal, to make your weight, go ahead and trim that up.
[18:28.300 --> 18:29.300]  Add that.
[18:29.300 --> 18:30.740]  Put that in the bottom of the bag.
[18:30.740 --> 18:34.580]  But if it's not necessary, if it's just for you, put that in the concentrate pile and
[18:34.580 --> 18:36.240]  speed yourself up.
[18:36.240 --> 18:41.620]  In a commercial grow, the growers are expected to kick out a pound minimum per person per
[18:41.620 --> 18:42.620]  shift.
[18:42.620 --> 18:46.180]  Some people turn in two pounds every day and if they spend time trimming that little gravel
[18:46.180 --> 18:48.040]  shit, they would never get there.
[18:48.040 --> 18:50.520]  We have a way of separating all those little tiny buds.
[18:50.520 --> 18:52.020]  All that little stuff gets filtered out.
[18:52.020 --> 18:56.300]  It gets pushed to the side and then all of that, those little buds and the trim, they're
[18:56.300 --> 18:59.220]  combined and it gets turned into concentrates.
[18:59.340 --> 19:02.980]  Do a nice tight trim if you want to sell it, but don't go overboard.
[19:02.980 --> 19:06.380]  Don't trim it too tight and also don't try trimming all those little buds or you're going
[19:06.380 --> 19:07.700]  to put yourself in debt.
[19:07.700 --> 19:09.100]  You've got to pay your trimmers.
[19:09.100 --> 19:10.440]  You're spending your time.
[19:10.440 --> 19:11.980]  Make it cost effective.
[19:11.980 --> 19:15.120]  Now something I want to mention, trimming will be very strain dependent.
[19:15.120 --> 19:17.100]  Some buds are tight.
[19:17.100 --> 19:19.260]  Some buds are real fluffy.
[19:19.260 --> 19:21.380]  Some buds are little compacted little rocks.
[19:21.380 --> 19:24.500]  You can just kind of rub your fingers over those and those are going to trim.
[19:24.500 --> 19:27.740]  Some buds are airy and have a lot of texture to them.
[19:27.740 --> 19:30.100]  Those are going to be a little harder to trim because you don't want to knock off all
[19:30.100 --> 19:31.100]  those calyxes.
[19:31.100 --> 19:33.180]  You're going to have to adjust.
[19:33.180 --> 19:36.500]  Also if you're working for somebody else, you're going to have to adjust to how they
[19:36.500 --> 19:37.740]  want it trimmed.
[19:37.740 --> 19:41.500]  When you go to a grow and you're working for someone else, they get to dictate how tight
[19:41.500 --> 19:42.800]  your trim is.
[19:42.800 --> 19:44.660]  Don't over trim, don't under trim.
[19:44.660 --> 19:46.140]  You trim to their expectation.
[19:46.140 --> 19:49.380]  If you're not sure what they want, have them trim up a bud and show you.
[19:49.380 --> 19:52.560]  Have them trim up two or three buds and set those at your workstation so you have something
[19:52.560 --> 19:55.820]  to refer to as the day goes on so that you don't forget.
[19:55.820 --> 19:58.140]  And also if they come by and say, hey, why are you doing it like that?
[19:58.140 --> 19:59.580]  You got a couple little buds to show them.
[19:59.580 --> 20:01.340]  You can say, hey, these are what you showed me.
[20:01.340 --> 20:02.340]  This is what I did.
[20:02.340 --> 20:03.340]  Show me the difference.
[20:03.340 --> 20:04.340]  Show me where I'm going wrong.
[20:04.340 --> 20:06.260]  Then they can say, fuck, you're doing it just like I showed you.
[20:06.260 --> 20:07.260]  I'm sorry.
[20:07.260 --> 20:08.380]  So we got a nice tight trim.
[20:08.380 --> 20:09.740]  We're setting the trim in one pile.
[20:09.740 --> 20:11.940]  We're setting our little tiny buds in another pile.
[20:11.940 --> 20:14.540]  We're mixing that up so we can make good concentrates out of it.
[20:14.540 --> 20:16.220]  We're getting rid of all the sticks.
[20:16.220 --> 20:19.300]  You guys, I think we have covered most of trimming.
[20:19.300 --> 20:22.660]  One great thing about trimming is scissor and glove hash.
[20:22.660 --> 20:26.260]  All that sticky shit that builds up on your gloves and scissors is smokeable.
[20:26.260 --> 20:28.260]  You can smoke that right away.
[20:28.260 --> 20:30.120]  Mike loves scissor hash.
[20:30.120 --> 20:33.300]  What I like to do if I've been trimming, so say you've been trimming, you've got this
[20:33.300 --> 20:37.320]  weird layer of like sticky, gooey looking shit all over your gloves.
[20:37.320 --> 20:38.320]  That's resin.
[20:38.320 --> 20:39.320]  That's trichomes.
[20:39.320 --> 20:40.320]  That is potency.
[20:40.320 --> 20:43.700]  Rub your hands together and you'll start figuring out how to rub your hands in a circle to make
[20:43.700 --> 20:44.980]  that stuff stick together.
[20:44.980 --> 20:46.640]  A little bit of heat goes a long way.
[20:46.640 --> 20:50.500]  So if your hands get warm, it'll start taking that resin right off of your hands.
[20:50.500 --> 20:52.640]  I don't want to smoke it off your skin.
[20:52.640 --> 20:56.940]  Back in the day, we used to call it finger hash, but please wear gloves now and we're
[20:56.940 --> 20:58.720]  going to call it glove hash.
[20:58.720 --> 20:59.920]  You can scrape it off your scissors.
[20:59.920 --> 21:01.520]  You can smoke it off your gloves.
[21:01.520 --> 21:02.520]  Then put it in a bowl.
[21:02.520 --> 21:06.080]  You can put it on top of some pot or just put it in an empty bowl and just put a flame
[21:06.080 --> 21:07.520]  to it and melt it.
[21:07.520 --> 21:11.120]  Just slowly melt that shit until it starts smoking and you can smoke that scissor hash,
[21:11.120 --> 21:13.960]  that glove hash, you can smoke it right away.
[21:13.960 --> 21:18.240]  But please don't pass that shit to me if you did that off your skin and weren't wearing
[21:18.240 --> 21:19.240]  gloves.
[21:19.240 --> 21:21.120]  I don't want to smoke your skin.
[21:21.120 --> 21:25.440]  So that's one good thing about trimming is you get scissor hash right away.
[21:25.440 --> 21:27.920]  I think that anything that sticks to your gloves, that's yours.
[21:27.920 --> 21:28.920]  You get to smoke that.
[21:28.920 --> 21:31.840]  If you come trim for me and that shit sticks to your gloves, I have no problem with you
[21:31.840 --> 21:35.080]  rolling that right off your glove, put that in a pipe and smoke it right in front of me.
[21:35.080 --> 21:36.080]  You earned that.
[21:36.080 --> 21:37.080]  That is your scissor hash.
[21:37.080 --> 21:38.720]  That means you're trimming your ass off.
[21:38.720 --> 21:42.600]  If it's on your scissors, scrape your scissors off, smoke that shit.
[21:42.600 --> 21:45.800]  What a lot of people will do, all the trimmers in the room will just gather all their scissor
[21:45.800 --> 21:48.600]  hash into one pile and put it into a big ball and then at the end of the day, you guys
[21:48.600 --> 21:49.600]  all smoke that together.
[21:49.920 --> 21:52.960]  It's like a little celebration, but it's smokeable.
[21:52.960 --> 21:53.960]  That's my point.
[21:53.960 --> 21:57.480]  You can make edibles out of it if you want to, but I would recommend smoking it.
[21:57.480 --> 21:58.640]  Mike loves smoking it.
[21:58.640 --> 21:59.800]  It's not my favorite to smoke.
[21:59.800 --> 22:03.960]  It's a little, it's heavy on the lungs and it tastes kind of wet, but it is potent and
[22:03.960 --> 22:07.080]  it will give you a big fat hit.
[22:07.080 --> 22:10.240]  Another great thing about dry trimming that I didn't mention is that when you were done
[22:10.240 --> 22:12.200]  trimming, you can now weigh your product.
[22:12.200 --> 22:14.360]  You've been cutting off the extra crap and throwing that in one pile.
[22:14.360 --> 22:16.840]  Then you've been throwing those finished buds into one pile.
[22:16.840 --> 22:19.160]  All you got to do is set that container on the scale and weigh it.
[22:19.160 --> 22:21.640]  Now, one thing I would recommend is a good idea.
[22:21.640 --> 22:24.840]  Whatever container you're going to throw your buds into your finished buds, if it's going
[22:24.840 --> 22:29.280]  to be a bucket, if it's going to be a Tupperware container, weigh that and write the weight
[22:29.280 --> 22:33.680]  of that on your container so that when you're done trimming into that container, you know
[22:33.680 --> 22:35.120]  how much that weighs.
[22:35.120 --> 22:38.800]  So just subtract the weight of your container and now you know how much product is on the
[22:38.800 --> 22:39.800]  scale.
[22:39.800 --> 22:42.720]  So it's always rewarding knowing how much product you've got right at the end of the
[22:42.720 --> 22:43.720]  trim process.
[22:43.720 --> 22:46.720]  When you wet trim, you don't know because you've got to wait for it to dry still.
[22:46.720 --> 22:48.200]  So when people say, how much did you trim today?
[22:48.200 --> 22:49.840]  And they said, I trimmed a wet pound.
[22:49.840 --> 22:50.840]  How do you know, bro?
[22:50.840 --> 22:51.840]  It was wet.
[22:51.840 --> 22:52.840]  It's got to dry.
[22:52.840 --> 22:53.840]  We'll find out in a few days.
[22:53.840 --> 22:57.240]  So if you're paying people to trim by the pound, dry trim is the way to go because now
[22:57.240 --> 22:58.920]  you've got dry pounds to weigh.
[22:58.920 --> 23:01.240]  You don't have a wet pound to guess on the weight.
[23:01.240 --> 23:04.680]  So here's one more thing I should definitely mention to all of my friends who have never
[23:04.680 --> 23:07.480]  trimmed before, everybody who is new with cannabis.
[23:07.480 --> 23:09.860]  Here's something that I have to tell you.
[23:09.860 --> 23:15.120]  When you were trimming or working with plants in general, do not touch your eyes with sticky
[23:15.120 --> 23:17.480]  trim fingers.
[23:17.480 --> 23:19.760]  Don't rub your eye with the back of your hand.
[23:19.760 --> 23:22.440]  Go wash your hands before you touch your eyes.
[23:22.440 --> 23:27.160]  If you rub your eyes with trichomes or plant resin on your finger, it is going to burn
[23:27.160 --> 23:29.880]  for the next hour and it is sticky.
[23:29.880 --> 23:33.320]  Every time you blink, most of the time you think you can blink and it'll fix your sticky
[23:33.320 --> 23:35.040]  eye or whatever's in your eye.
[23:35.040 --> 23:36.280]  Not when you have resin in your eye.
[23:36.280 --> 23:39.480]  Every time you blink, it gets fucking stickier and it feels like your eyelid is sticking
[23:39.480 --> 23:41.540]  to your eyeball and it just burns.
[23:41.540 --> 23:47.420]  So wear gloves and if you need to itch your eye, take your fucking glove off your hand,
[23:47.420 --> 23:48.420]  then itch your eye.
[23:48.420 --> 23:51.260]  I would almost consider washing my hands before the itch.
[23:51.260 --> 23:53.780]  Take the glove off, go wash the hand, then scratch the eye.
[23:53.780 --> 23:56.260]  But I understand sometimes you just gotta stick your finger in your eye because shit's
[23:56.260 --> 23:57.260]  going weird.
[23:57.260 --> 23:58.540]  Take that glove off you guys.
[23:58.540 --> 24:02.020]  Don't put plant resin or trichomes in your eye.
[24:02.020 --> 24:03.980]  It will fucking suck.
[24:03.980 --> 24:05.060]  That's the technical term for it.
[24:05.060 --> 24:06.100]  It fucking sucks.
[24:06.100 --> 24:07.360]  There's no other way to describe it.
[24:07.360 --> 24:08.460]  It fucking sucks you guys.
[24:08.460 --> 24:09.460]  All right.
[24:09.460 --> 24:11.340]  So I feel like I've given you a pretty good lesson on trimming.
[24:11.340 --> 24:14.700]  I know I didn't teach you exactly how to trim.
[24:14.700 --> 24:18.580]  The act of holding the bud and putting the scissors to it is something you're going to
[24:18.580 --> 24:19.620]  have to experience.
[24:19.620 --> 24:21.860]  You will develop your technique and your style.
[24:21.860 --> 24:23.580]  I feel like I've given you a pretty good outline.
[24:23.580 --> 24:24.820]  You know what to do with the product.
[24:24.820 --> 24:26.140]  You know how to get it there.
[24:26.140 --> 24:28.000]  You just need some practice doing it.
[24:28.000 --> 24:30.240]  Get some buds and put some scissors to them.
[24:30.240 --> 24:32.100]  That's the only way you're going to get good at it.
[24:32.100 --> 24:34.340]  It's the only way you're going to get faster at it.
[24:34.340 --> 24:38.580]  When we hire new trimmers at The Grow, we don't always hire the people that claim to
[24:38.580 --> 24:39.700]  be the fastest trimmers.
[24:39.700 --> 24:42.700]  We hire the people that interview well and seem like they're going to fit in with the
[24:42.700 --> 24:43.700]  crew.
[24:43.700 --> 24:47.340]  If they say they can only trim a half a pound of weed when they start, that is fine if that
[24:47.340 --> 24:48.340]  is real.
[24:48.340 --> 24:51.540]  If they say they can trim a half a pound and they only do a quarter pound, then I've got
[24:51.540 --> 24:52.540]  issues.
[24:52.540 --> 24:54.420]  But they say, I can trim a half a pound in a day.
[24:54.420 --> 24:55.420]  I'm fine with that.
[24:55.420 --> 24:56.540]  We will train them.
[24:56.540 --> 24:57.780]  We will teach them our system.
[24:57.780 --> 24:58.860]  We'll teach them some tricks.
[24:58.860 --> 25:02.660]  They'll get in, they'll get a rhythm, they'll get a routine, and eventually they'll be trimming
[25:02.660 --> 25:04.360]  a pound and a half a day.
[25:04.360 --> 25:05.900]  So it's all about just finding the rhythm.
[25:05.900 --> 25:07.340]  It's all about finding the groove.
[25:07.340 --> 25:10.700]  And it takes you a little bit of time and experience to get in there and do it.
[25:10.700 --> 25:12.460]  Also, these are buds.
[25:12.460 --> 25:14.500]  These are precious to people.
[25:14.500 --> 25:16.340]  I've been in this industry for a long time.
[25:16.340 --> 25:20.180]  I can grab a flowering plant that's a few days in and just cut that fucker down and
[25:20.180 --> 25:21.540]  feel no remorse or anything.
[25:21.540 --> 25:24.980]  If that's what needed to happen in a commercial grow, I kill the plant.
[25:24.980 --> 25:28.500]  A lot of people treat little buds like they're the most precious thing they've ever seen,
[25:28.500 --> 25:29.540]  which I respect.
[25:29.540 --> 25:30.780]  You don't get to grow a bunch of plants.
[25:30.780 --> 25:34.320]  I have produced over a ton of cannabis in my life.
[25:34.360 --> 25:37.480]  I am responsible for a ton of cannabis having been produced.
[25:37.480 --> 25:39.760]  A lot of people don't have that under their belt.
[25:39.760 --> 25:41.800]  So every bud is precious to them.
[25:41.800 --> 25:43.840]  They don't want to fuck up one single bud.
[25:43.840 --> 25:44.840]  I get that.
[25:44.840 --> 25:48.300]  So when they're new at it, they go really slow, especially a hired trimmer.
[25:48.300 --> 25:49.440]  That is not their product.
[25:49.440 --> 25:51.520]  That is your bud that they're playing with.
[25:51.520 --> 25:55.320]  Respect them for taking their time and going slow with it, but also encourage them to go
[25:55.320 --> 25:56.360]  faster.
[25:56.360 --> 25:58.480]  You have to learn and go faster.
[25:58.480 --> 26:02.260]  But people like to go slow in the beginning because they're playing with gold.
[26:02.260 --> 26:04.300]  They're playing with little pieces of gold.
[26:04.300 --> 26:07.580]  They got little babies in their hand and they're new, so they're kind of intimidated.
[26:07.580 --> 26:09.060]  So keep that in mind.
[26:09.060 --> 26:11.260]  You'll get faster as time goes on is what I'm trying to say.
[26:11.260 --> 26:12.260]  You just need some practice.
[26:12.260 --> 26:15.060]  You'll become a good trimmer if you want to become a good trimmer.
[26:15.060 --> 26:19.180]  If you want to get your foot in the door in the commercial marijuana industry, being a
[26:19.180 --> 26:23.060]  trimmer is probably the number one way to get in the door.
[26:23.060 --> 26:25.380]  Trimmers and bud tenders are how you get started.
[26:25.380 --> 26:29.740]  So trimming can be really time consuming and tedious, but it is the last step before you
[26:29.740 --> 26:31.620]  claim victory in your garden.
[26:31.620 --> 26:35.060]  If your garden is for sale, you're one step away from money.
[26:35.060 --> 26:40.740]  If your garden is for medicinal uses, you're one step away from feeling better.
[26:40.740 --> 26:43.980]  So trimming sucks, but you're almost there.
[26:43.980 --> 26:46.940]  It's the hardest, most time consuming, tedious part in my opinion.
[26:46.940 --> 26:51.140]  It is my least favorite part, but it is one step away from sweet success.
[26:51.140 --> 26:54.540]  All right, podcast world, I hope this trimming lesson made sense.
[26:54.540 --> 26:58.760]  Again, the only way to get good at trimming is to get sticky and get some practice.
[26:58.760 --> 27:01.880]  Get in there, get your gloves dirty, get your scissors all sticky, and start trimming
[27:01.880 --> 27:02.880]  up some weed.
[27:02.880 --> 27:06.320]  If you want to learn and you've got friends that are harvesting, volunteer to trim for
[27:06.320 --> 27:07.400]  free.
[27:07.400 --> 27:10.160]  Everybody could use a free trimmer, and we know we're going to have to teach you.
[27:10.160 --> 27:13.080]  That's fine, but we hope that in a few harvests, you're going to show up and you're going to
[27:13.080 --> 27:14.800]  trim your ass off like a savage.
[27:14.800 --> 27:18.400]  So there are people that will help you learn by letting you trim for free.
[27:18.400 --> 27:21.200]  If you get those opportunities, please do take them.
[27:21.200 --> 27:23.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure I left something out.
[27:23.280 --> 27:24.480]  I'm sure I missed something.
[27:24.480 --> 27:29.160]  If I sparked any questions with this episode, I invite you to email me all of your questions.
[27:29.160 --> 27:32.280]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[27:32.280 --> 27:33.600]  I would love to hear what I skipped.
[27:33.600 --> 27:35.320]  I'd love to hear what I left out.
[27:35.320 --> 27:38.960]  Or if you've got some other random questions, I will answer those also.
[27:38.960 --> 27:42.280]  Once again, it's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[27:42.280 --> 27:45.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for listening to the trimming episode.
[27:45.480 --> 27:48.000]  Here is the part where I pitch my Patreon campaign.
[27:48.000 --> 27:51.060]  I would truly appreciate your support on Patreon.
[27:51.060 --> 27:55.100]  If you feel like this podcast was worth a couple of bucks and you were able to contribute
[27:55.100 --> 28:06.820]  financially, you can do so by going to patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[28:06.820 --> 28:10.220]  If you'd like to contribute to the podcast, all the information that you need will be
[28:10.220 --> 28:11.800]  right there.
[28:11.800 --> 28:15.380]  If you contribute to the podcast, I will use those contributions to pay for the website
[28:15.380 --> 28:17.580]  that keeps the podcast free for everybody.
[28:17.580 --> 28:21.900]  I will also use those contributions to pay for the upgraded MacBook I bought so that
[28:21.900 --> 28:26.580]  I can keep the podcast coming and keep the videos coming to everybody for free.
[28:26.580 --> 28:28.940]  You guys, I will never charge you for this podcast.
[28:28.940 --> 28:33.660]  As long as I am able to put this podcast out for free, it will be free for you as well.
[28:33.660 --> 28:38.480]  I may in the future release some paid content, which will be bonus content, but this version
[28:38.480 --> 28:41.900]  of the podcast in this format always will be free.
[28:41.900 --> 28:45.700]  iTunes, Stitcher, and the YouTube channel as it is will always be free.
[28:45.700 --> 28:49.980]  I do this because I love cannabis and I love you and I want you to be able to medicate
[28:49.980 --> 28:55.340]  and recreate the best ways possible with the highest quality, cleanest, safest products
[28:55.340 --> 28:58.980]  available and I think the only way you can do that is by growing it yourself.
[28:58.980 --> 29:03.500]  So I've got to teach you how to do that so that you don't have to rely on anybody else.
[29:03.500 --> 29:07.260]  So my point is that the podcast will be free, but I know there are people out there who
[29:07.260 --> 29:10.580]  would like to contribute because they emailed me and they said, Hey Jeff, how can we help
[29:10.580 --> 29:11.580]  you out?
[29:11.580 --> 29:13.860]  So Patreon is the best way to do that.
[29:13.860 --> 29:17.420]  Patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[29:17.420 --> 29:20.100]  Also I would appreciate it if you stalk me on the social media.
[29:20.100 --> 29:21.500]  You can find me on Facebook.
[29:21.500 --> 29:23.860]  Simply search for the grow from your heart podcast on Twitter.

[29:49.440 --> 29:51.520]  I'll be back Monday with a brand new episode.
[29:51.520 --> 29:54.440]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend Grimbolt the Druid.
[29:54.440 --> 29:57.800]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
