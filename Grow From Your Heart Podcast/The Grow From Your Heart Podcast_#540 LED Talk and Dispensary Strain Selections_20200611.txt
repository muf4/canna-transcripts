[00:04.480 --> 00:09.120]  Happy birthday Brody. Welcome back podcast world. I'm your host Rasta Jeff and it is time for

[00:48.640 --> 00:53.840]  podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking. Today, I've been taking dabs of Garlic Banger
[00:53.840 --> 00:59.200]  No. 6 Live Batter from our friends at Green Dot Labs. On the package, it says this is a blend of
[00:59.200 --> 01:05.680]  Headbanger and Han Solo Burger. The flavor is described as garlic, cookies, and sour. I think I
[01:05.680 --> 01:10.240]  agree with that. When I crack open the jar, I'm punched in the face with a pungent garlic aroma.
[01:10.240 --> 01:15.280]  When I take a dab, I get that garlic aroma. On the exhale, I get a little bit of sour. And then
[01:15.280 --> 01:20.400]  as it sits on my tongue, I do get a little bit of sweet cookies and garlic on my tongue as an
[01:20.400 --> 01:24.960]  aftertaste. So I find that description to be perfect. On the back of the package, it says the
[01:24.960 --> 01:32.320]  product contains 69.97% THC. I am loving the flavor. I am loving the buzz. This is delicious
[01:32.320 --> 01:38.560]  concentrate. Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious Garlic Banger No. 6
[01:38.560 --> 01:43.920]  Live Batter. All right, ladies and gentlemen, in this episode, I'm going to talk a little bit about
[01:43.920 --> 01:49.120]  LEDs. We may read a Patreon question. But before we get there, let's do some shout outs to the
[01:49.120 --> 01:54.240]  folks that support the show on Patreon. Let's start off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast.

[02:36.760 --> 02:38.480]  forward slash grow from your heart.
[02:38.640 --> 02:41.240]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[02:41.360 --> 02:46.640]  Once again, big thanks, big shout out to everybody who has continued to support the show.
[02:47.040 --> 02:50.760]  All right, before we get to the LED talk, I need to mention music.
[02:50.880 --> 02:55.600]  Somebody has asked me to post a list of the songs which I've played at the end of the podcast.
[02:55.720 --> 03:00.760]  I'm going to update that and I will post that to social media so you guys can get a good list of the songs I've played.
[03:00.880 --> 03:04.160]  Though if you've enjoyed some of those tracks, you can download them, you can listen to them.
[03:04.320 --> 03:06.000]  Hopefully you support those artists.
[03:06.120 --> 03:07.760]  The music industry is a pain in the ass.
[03:07.880 --> 03:10.360]  Show some love to the artists that I introduce you to.
[03:10.480 --> 03:15.600]  You probably already know who half of them are, but there will be some reggae bands in there that are slightly obscure to some of you.
[03:15.760 --> 03:17.200]  So I will post that list.
[03:17.880 --> 03:21.840]  Something I'm going to have to do in the future is stop putting in other people's music.
[03:21.960 --> 03:27.160]  If I want the podcast to grow, if I want it playable on other platforms, if I want it to expand,
[03:27.280 --> 03:29.360]  I'm going to have to quit using copyrighted music.
[03:29.760 --> 03:34.320]  Every time I put somebody else's music in the show, I do get a copyright notice from YouTube.
[03:34.440 --> 03:36.960]  They aren't mad about it, but I think over time, eventually they'll say,
[03:37.080 --> 03:41.920]  hey, you've used 500 of 500 instances of somebody else's songs.
[03:42.040 --> 03:43.200]  We're going to have to fuck with you for that.
[03:43.320 --> 03:46.400]  Eventually it may limit me in growing down the future.
[03:46.520 --> 03:50.040]  So I'm going to shy away from using other people's music in the future,
[03:50.160 --> 03:53.440]  probably another 10 or 12 episodes before we can stop doing that.
[03:53.560 --> 03:54.480]  We can get away with it.
[03:54.640 --> 03:56.800]  But if I want the show to grow, it's something I need to do.
[03:56.920 --> 03:58.200]  And I would like the show to grow.
[03:58.320 --> 04:00.360]  I'd like to make the video show go further.
[04:00.480 --> 04:01.840]  I'd like to make the audio show go further.
[04:01.960 --> 04:04.120]  Some platforms will not take it with other music.
[04:04.440 --> 04:09.320]  So the short version of this story is if you are a producer, if you make music out there,
[04:09.520 --> 04:13.920]  I would like a short intro track, just about something, uh, 30, 45,
[04:14.040 --> 04:15.920]  maybe a minute and a half at the longest.
[04:16.160 --> 04:18.120]  Uh, of course, you know, I like reggae.
[04:18.240 --> 04:20.680]  I'd like something that kicks in the door with a big fat beat.
[04:21.120 --> 04:24.600]  Uh, something that lets you know, you're listening to the grow from your heart podcast
[04:24.720 --> 04:26.000]  hosted by Rasta Jeff.
[04:26.360 --> 04:29.600]  Um, something about cannabis culture, cannabis community.
[04:29.960 --> 04:32.320]  Um, stay positive in the fucking wording.
[04:32.440 --> 04:35.880]  If you put words in there, um, reggae is best, you know, I like reggae,
[04:36.000 --> 04:37.000]  but I'm open for whatever.
[04:37.320 --> 04:40.760]  If you would like to charge me for a song, send me some samples of your work.
[04:40.880 --> 04:42.960]  I will see if you are doing what I'm into.
[04:43.080 --> 04:45.520]  I'm picky when it comes to music, especially if I'm paying you for it.
[04:45.840 --> 04:47.920]  Uh, if you'd like to trade for seeds, that's always an option.
[04:48.040 --> 04:51.280]  If you'd like to be paid in cash or PayPal, that is always an option.
[04:51.480 --> 04:53.960]  Uh, if you're a producer out there doing music, doing production,
[04:54.160 --> 04:57.000]  especially some sort of a reggae project, let me know.
[04:57.120 --> 04:58.480]  I'd love to get some music on the show.
[04:58.680 --> 05:02.760]  The catch is it has got to be 100% original music.
[05:03.440 --> 05:04.920]  I can't use a remix.
[05:05.040 --> 05:06.040]  I can't use a dub.
[05:06.280 --> 05:10.440]  I can't use anything that has ever been put on YouTube or copyrighted before.
[05:10.440 --> 05:11.920]  It's got to be for me.
[05:11.920 --> 05:14.720]  You can copyright it, but you've got to give me the rights to that music.
[05:14.720 --> 05:15.280]  It is mine.
[05:15.280 --> 05:18.080]  Once I buy it from you, I guess it means I own the copyright, right?
[05:18.080 --> 05:19.040]  So I'll be copywriting it.
[05:19.400 --> 05:23.520]  But what happens is once somebody puts a track on YouTube, YouTube has an
[05:23.520 --> 05:27.920]  algorithm that can find that track in any other music, especially popular shit.
[05:27.920 --> 05:31.400]  So if I put an obscure song on there, it takes them a couple of days to flag me.
[05:31.400 --> 05:34.440]  If I put a popular song on there, the minute that shit uploads, YouTube goes,
[05:34.480 --> 05:36.000]  Hey, you just played Metallica.
[05:36.000 --> 05:37.120]  We know Metallica real well.
[05:37.120 --> 05:37.920]  You can't do that.
[05:38.160 --> 05:41.120]  So it has to be something that has never been heard by YouTube.
[05:41.120 --> 05:43.720]  Something that has never been copyrighted, played in a video before.
[05:44.040 --> 05:45.040]  Original music.
[05:45.040 --> 05:47.040]  So if you've got some music, contact me.
[05:47.320 --> 05:50.320]  The email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[05:50.320 --> 05:51.760]  I'd love to get your music on the show.
[05:51.960 --> 05:55.480]  If you'd just like to send me, just donate a track, I will definitely play it.
[05:55.520 --> 05:59.040]  Give me all the artist info you need so I can give you a shout out,
[05:59.040 --> 06:00.080]  give you credit for your work.
[06:00.400 --> 06:03.400]  Maybe I'll send you some beans or a shirt or something like that.
[06:03.400 --> 06:06.320]  You'll definitely get a shout out on the show, but okay, that's enough of that.
[06:06.360 --> 06:07.320]  I've been talking for a long time.
[06:07.360 --> 06:07.960]  I need music.
[06:07.960 --> 06:09.360]  You guys, I can't keep borrowing music.
[06:09.360 --> 06:10.360]  I need original tracks.
[06:10.680 --> 06:11.560]  Help a Wookie out.
[06:11.560 --> 06:12.080]  Thank you.
[06:12.600 --> 06:13.840]  Uh, where are we going next?
[06:13.920 --> 06:15.320]  LED talk, you guys.
[06:15.320 --> 06:16.200]  Holy shit.
[06:17.120 --> 06:20.360]  I have been very hesitant to switch over to LED lighting.
[06:20.360 --> 06:23.280]  A lot of people tell me LED is the way it's more effective.
[06:23.280 --> 06:23.960]  It's more efficient.
[06:23.960 --> 06:24.920]  It's more affordable.
[06:25.200 --> 06:27.800]  Uh, the plant seem, they say the plants seem to like it.
[06:28.080 --> 06:29.200]  I am a commercial grower.
[06:29.200 --> 06:33.040]  I'm known, uh, my reputation is for running commercial grows and also for being a
[06:33.080 --> 06:35.240]  breeder, uh, in a commercial environment.
[06:35.560 --> 06:39.560]  I rely on numbers and we're going to talk about numbers in the future, but I rely on
[06:39.560 --> 06:41.600]  weights and potency and scheduling.
[06:41.920 --> 06:46.160]  And I know that the double ended Govita lights, the double ended HPS lights, which
[06:46.160 --> 06:49.960]  I've been using in a commercial production, they hit all of the numbers I need.
[06:50.280 --> 06:54.760]  I don't know that I would ever switch my commercial grow away from double ended
[06:54.840 --> 06:58.280]  HPS bulbs in talking with a few friends.
[06:58.360 --> 07:01.480]  They've convinced me to give LED lighting a try.
[07:01.480 --> 07:04.320]  I've made good friends with a guy who owns an LED company.
[07:04.320 --> 07:05.400]  Shout out to my buddy, Keith.
[07:05.640 --> 07:08.880]  Keith and I were talking and he said, bro, why don't you run a couple of these LEDs
[07:08.880 --> 07:10.680]  in a tent and let me know what you think.
[07:11.000 --> 07:15.640]  He honestly gave me two Canon lights from Black Sale Market.
[07:15.800 --> 07:19.600]  So I've got two cannons from Black Sale in a five by five tent.
[07:20.000 --> 07:22.760]  I've been running them for, um, I'm looking at the date.
[07:22.760 --> 07:23.320]  I'm going to say.
[07:23.840 --> 07:27.560]  Uh, all of April and most of May, uh, most of April and all of May.
[07:27.560 --> 07:29.960]  I messed that up, but they've been going for almost two months now.
[07:30.520 --> 07:34.840]  And I am honestly completely impressed with the growth that I
[07:34.840 --> 07:36.600]  am seeing from these LED lights.
[07:37.040 --> 07:40.640]  I was really hesitant to spend money on them and change my setup.
[07:40.680 --> 07:43.520]  But when somebody gave me two of them, I put a tent in a spare room.
[07:43.520 --> 07:45.640]  I put some lights, some plants, some seedlings under there.
[07:45.920 --> 07:48.000]  My tongue is tied up today, but we'll get a podcast going.
[07:48.000 --> 07:48.520]  Don't worry guys.
[07:48.840 --> 07:51.200]  I put plants under the lights is the way that worked.
[07:51.520 --> 07:55.760]  Um, and they've been growing for a while and I am seeing amazing growth.
[07:56.200 --> 07:59.680]  Uh, I also put a cloner on the peripheral edge of that tent.
[07:59.680 --> 08:03.000]  It was outside of the tent, just on the outside of the tent on a little, uh,
[08:03.040 --> 08:05.920]  little table and those clones rooted super quickly.
[08:05.920 --> 08:07.720]  They loved that led lighting.
[08:07.720 --> 08:11.360]  So the clones showed me right away when I cut clones, they never drooped.
[08:11.360 --> 08:12.440]  They never did anything weird.
[08:12.440 --> 08:13.760]  They went into an easy cloner.
[08:14.080 --> 08:17.880]  There was at the edge of the tent and that light from that, uh, Canon light
[08:17.880 --> 08:22.200]  at the middle of the tent shown out enough to make those clones grow super happily.
[08:22.200 --> 08:22.960]  They never drooped.
[08:22.960 --> 08:25.680]  They never skipped a beat that told me something right away.
[08:26.440 --> 08:28.440]  I've been watching the plants that I put in there grow.
[08:28.840 --> 08:31.600]  They're staying super short and super squat.
[08:31.840 --> 08:34.080]  The node spacing is super tight.
[08:34.080 --> 08:37.800]  Most of the time I would get, I'm going to guess about an inch between nodes.
[08:37.800 --> 08:41.320]  And right now we're about a half, maybe three quarters of an inch between nodes.
[08:41.520 --> 08:46.080]  So normally I would veg under T5 lighting was my go-to lighting for veg.
[08:46.560 --> 08:50.560]  Uh, I vegged under LEDs and I see much more rapid growth.
[08:50.560 --> 08:53.800]  I see much more nodes, uh, tighter node spacing.
[08:53.840 --> 08:55.160]  I see more branching.
[08:55.480 --> 08:56.840]  So I've got my node spacing.
[08:56.880 --> 08:59.120]  My branches are growing out and off of those branches.
[08:59.120 --> 09:00.960]  I am getting more shoots.
[09:01.160 --> 09:02.320]  The plants are in veg.
[09:02.320 --> 09:04.560]  They are still what I would consider small plants.
[09:04.560 --> 09:09.200]  I've had to defoliate them two times and I've bottomed and cleaned them up because
[09:09.200 --> 09:13.040]  they are so bushy and so branchy that they would survive the way they are.
[09:13.040 --> 09:16.040]  But being a commercial cultivator, I like to go in and take off excessive
[09:16.040 --> 09:17.560]  leaves and excessive branches.
[09:17.560 --> 09:19.840]  That makes my plants grow more at the top.
[09:19.840 --> 09:21.120]  It encourages growth to the top.
[09:21.880 --> 09:22.320]  Excuse me.
[09:22.320 --> 09:25.720]  It also allows for more airflow throughout the canopy, throughout the plant.
[09:25.720 --> 09:30.240]  So I did some defoliating because these LEDs are making the plants grow rapidly.
[09:30.240 --> 09:32.680]  I'm not used to this fast of growth in my bedroom.
[09:32.680 --> 09:34.800]  So I think I'm really impressed.
[09:35.360 --> 09:36.800]  Um, they're growing faster.
[09:36.800 --> 09:38.200]  They're growing very healthy.
[09:38.400 --> 09:40.160]  They are eating like a champion.
[09:40.160 --> 09:43.080]  I've noticed that I don't see any nutrient burn and I am feeding
[09:43.080 --> 09:44.640]  the shit out of these plants.
[09:44.640 --> 09:48.120]  Usually by now, uh, what I call getting the nails done, the little tips of the
[09:48.120 --> 09:49.800]  leaves would have browned up a little bit.
[09:49.800 --> 09:51.400]  That is not happening to these plants.
[09:51.400 --> 09:52.200]  I think they love it.
[09:52.560 --> 09:54.760]  Also, uh, it is not as hot.
[09:55.080 --> 10:00.440]  I replaced a, so in that normal room, there would be a 600 or a thousand watt
[10:00.440 --> 10:03.880]  HBS, depending on the season and the summer I would run the six in the winter.
[10:03.880 --> 10:04.720]  I'd run the thousand.
[10:04.720 --> 10:06.680]  That's just things we do in Colorado to adjust.
[10:06.680 --> 10:09.240]  It's colder in the winter, run that thousand, keep the house warm.
[10:09.600 --> 10:11.040]  Uh, it gets a little bit hotter in the summer.
[10:11.040 --> 10:12.720]  Take that thousand output of six in there.
[10:12.920 --> 10:14.440]  So we don't have to compete with it as much.
[10:14.920 --> 10:19.640]  Uh, but so in flower, I would have a thousand in there in veg or a six in
[10:19.640 --> 10:21.400]  veg, I would have two T fives in there.
[10:21.880 --> 10:28.280]  Right now I've got two 320 watt Canon LEDs from black sale and the room is not too hot.
[10:28.280 --> 10:30.000]  I don't have any air conditioning running.
[10:30.000 --> 10:31.440]  I don't have a swamp cooler running.
[10:31.440 --> 10:35.240]  I've just got the lights running in the room with the ambient, uh, airflow from
[10:35.240 --> 10:36.840]  the house and the air exchange.
[10:36.840 --> 10:40.120]  I've got a fan blowing the air out of the room so that we get a little air exchange.
[10:40.400 --> 10:43.800]  Other than that, there's no special arrangements and it is not too hot in there.
[10:44.040 --> 10:45.840]  The plants really seem to be thriving.
[10:46.120 --> 10:47.120]  They're not stretching.
[10:47.320 --> 10:48.520]  They're not doing anything weird.
[10:48.520 --> 10:50.240]  They're not having any nutrient deficiencies.
[10:50.480 --> 10:55.600]  I think I am impressed with led lighting, especially these Canon LEDs
[10:55.720 --> 10:56.920]  from our friends at black sale.
[10:57.160 --> 10:58.600]  They did not pay me to say this.
[10:58.720 --> 11:01.040]  Keith does not know this podcast is happening right now.
[11:01.040 --> 11:04.200]  I'm just so excited about the lights that I wanted to honestly come on
[11:04.200 --> 11:05.880]  here and talk about it with you guys.
[11:07.080 --> 11:10.120]  The part I really wanted to talk about, uh, that was kind of a setup.
[11:10.440 --> 11:15.560]  It made me think about by watching these plants, they're growing differently than
[11:15.600 --> 11:19.040]  my plants in the past have grown because of the lighting, I've got brand new
[11:19.040 --> 11:20.920]  seedlings in there that I've never grown before.
[11:20.920 --> 11:24.880]  Plus I've also got familiar plants in there that I'm very familiar with, which
[11:24.880 --> 11:29.320]  I've grown lots of times for years, 10 years, some of them three years, others,
[11:29.360 --> 11:31.640]  some of them are not as old, but I'm familiar with them.
[11:32.920 --> 11:34.040]  I'm seeing different growth.
[11:34.040 --> 11:35.280]  I'm seeing different leaf shapes.
[11:35.280 --> 11:38.680]  I'm seeing different structures, not completely different, but as a
[11:38.680 --> 11:40.280]  breeder, I am noticing differences.
[11:40.280 --> 11:41.560]  The plants are squattier.
[11:41.720 --> 11:43.000]  They're not a branching.
[11:43.000 --> 11:44.440]  The branches aren't as long.
[11:44.640 --> 11:48.320]  The apical tops, the dominant tops aren't as, uh, dominant.
[11:48.320 --> 11:49.400]  They're not as ridiculous.
[11:49.400 --> 11:51.920]  Everything is staying a little bit shorter and tighter.
[11:52.120 --> 11:54.840]  The canopy is more even without as much manipulation.
[11:55.560 --> 12:01.520]  I am wondering, uh, if I would have chosen different phenotypes in all of my
[12:01.520 --> 12:05.200]  selections in the past, if I had been growing with led lighting, I may have
[12:05.200 --> 12:06.320]  seen different traits.
[12:06.400 --> 12:08.040]  I may have seen different features.
[12:08.040 --> 12:09.280]  I may have seen different colors.
[12:09.280 --> 12:11.400]  I may, I haven't flowered under these lights yet.
[12:11.600 --> 12:13.760]  I may discover that I'm getting different aromas.
[12:14.000 --> 12:17.440]  I may have discovered that I'm getting different buzzes from these finished
[12:17.440 --> 12:17.960]  flowers.
[12:18.440 --> 12:23.280]  I'm wondering, uh, if I had been growing under LEDs, maybe my breeding would
[12:23.280 --> 12:24.520]  have gone different directions.
[12:24.560 --> 12:27.600]  I'm wondering if my growing would have gone a completely different direction.
[12:27.800 --> 12:29.960]  Had I been using led lighting in the past?
[12:29.960 --> 12:31.960]  Cause my plants are acting completely different.
[12:32.440 --> 12:34.040]  Was there a phenotype in the past?
[12:34.040 --> 12:38.120]  They got too stretchy that I eliminated, but maybe under these led lights, it
[12:38.120 --> 12:40.520]  would have stayed nice and squat and it would have been a fucking champion.
[12:40.960 --> 12:43.200]  That's just some weird path that my brain went down.
[12:43.440 --> 12:45.080]  Did I select wrong plants?
[12:45.080 --> 12:46.360]  I know I didn't select wrong plants.
[12:46.360 --> 12:47.280]  You guys are breeding with them.
[12:47.280 --> 12:48.160]  You guys are growing them.
[12:48.160 --> 12:48.840]  I'm having fun.
[12:48.840 --> 12:49.360]  You're having fun.
[12:49.360 --> 12:53.120]  They're definitely successful, but it's got me second guessing selections.
[12:53.120 --> 12:56.640]  Now it's got me wondering, like, did we make mistakes in the past?
[12:56.920 --> 13:00.960]  It's also got me thinking about going back and getting old batches of seeds and
[13:00.960 --> 13:05.440]  growing them and looking through them again to see, let's just take a rise.
[13:05.440 --> 13:08.280]  For an example, you guys know, I've grown tons of arise seeds.
[13:08.280 --> 13:11.840]  I grew out probably 500 seeds looking for King Solomon just for that male.
[13:12.160 --> 13:14.680]  So I got to see 500 different plants of that grow.
[13:14.960 --> 13:17.080]  What if I grow 500 more under LEDs?
[13:17.080 --> 13:18.320]  Am I going to see different shit?
[13:18.600 --> 13:23.240]  I probably am just that one variation is going to meet, give me such different shit.
[13:23.640 --> 13:26.280]  So think keep that puts me down a lot of other paths.
[13:27.120 --> 13:29.120]  Keep that in mind when you're shopping for seeds.
[13:29.680 --> 13:32.760]  Uh, most of my stuff I send out to a lot of people and let them test it.
[13:32.760 --> 13:36.440]  So we get to see what it does under LEDs, under HPS, under ceramic metal
[13:36.440 --> 13:40.320]  highlights, under T5s, we also get to see some experimental shit that crazy
[13:40.320 --> 13:41.480]  people do out there and I love it.
[13:41.480 --> 13:42.120]  Keep doing that.
[13:42.520 --> 13:44.960]  But keep in mind, you're going to get different results.
[13:45.000 --> 13:49.680]  I say when I grow it, I get this, but until now I've been growing under HPS.
[13:50.200 --> 13:54.760]  Now that I'm growing under LEDs, I may, my flavor profiles may expand.
[13:54.760 --> 13:58.320]  I may see completely different things out of my breeding, out of my growing.
[13:58.560 --> 14:02.120]  This may change a lot for me and keep that in mind when you're selecting that.
[14:02.120 --> 14:04.560]  What I have said is based on my HPS lights.
[14:04.560 --> 14:06.920]  I do use feedback from a lot of other growers.
[14:06.920 --> 14:08.480]  I've got testers, I've got friends.
[14:08.840 --> 14:10.000]  Uh, they're, they all get the seeds.
[14:10.000 --> 14:10.640]  They grow them.
[14:10.840 --> 14:14.280]  I use their input, but obviously my descriptions and things are mostly from
[14:14.280 --> 14:17.920]  what I discovered because I can rely on myself when three people say it
[14:17.920 --> 14:20.560]  tastes like strawberries, the word strawberries goes into the description.
[14:20.560 --> 14:23.040]  If one guy says it tasted like a dog fart, I don't put the word
[14:23.040 --> 14:24.040]  dog fart in the description.
[14:24.360 --> 14:27.720]  If six people said dog fart, that goes in the description, but ultimately
[14:27.720 --> 14:29.160]  I make the description decisions.
[14:29.600 --> 14:31.600]  Um, so keep that kind of stuff in mind.
[14:31.600 --> 14:34.040]  You guys, I was just kinda, I thought it was really profound.
[14:34.040 --> 14:35.000]  I had a lot of deep thought.
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.840]  Maybe I was baked, but I was sitting there thinking, man, was I fucking up
[14:37.840 --> 14:41.840]  for all these years growing under HPSs and selecting differently, making a
[14:41.840 --> 14:44.760]  switch really triggered thoughts in my brain, then there's another
[14:44.760 --> 14:46.080]  path that my brain went down.
[14:46.400 --> 14:50.760]  Um, I'm going to call them our forefathers, the guys before me, the
[14:50.760 --> 14:53.800]  guys before them, and the guys before them, the guys that were growing
[14:53.800 --> 14:56.200]  cannabis in the sixties and or seventies.
[14:56.200 --> 14:59.840]  I don't know exactly when people started doing home grows around here, but in
[14:59.840 --> 15:03.440]  the States, when people started doing home grows, we were very limited on equipment.
[15:03.440 --> 15:04.680]  We didn't have a grow store.
[15:05.000 --> 15:06.040]  What was a grow light?
[15:06.080 --> 15:07.520]  Nobody was growing indoors.
[15:07.600 --> 15:09.000]  So we didn't have a grow light.
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.880]  And if you had access to a grow light, you weren't going to go buy it because
[15:11.880 --> 15:14.160]  people would say, what the fuck are you doing with a grow light?
[15:14.520 --> 15:17.160]  Uh, they would expect you to have a greenhouse or show up with tomatoes
[15:17.160 --> 15:18.400]  or cucumbers in a few weeks.
[15:18.400 --> 15:19.600]  And that shit's not going to happen.
[15:19.920 --> 15:22.120]  So there were no grow lights back in the day.
[15:22.480 --> 15:27.760]  Uh, also there weren't websites with very detailed strain descriptions and
[15:27.760 --> 15:29.640]  seeds available for people to work with.
[15:29.640 --> 15:35.080]  So people back in the day were very limited on equipment, uh, products.
[15:35.280 --> 15:39.000]  And everything, everything, knowledge, especially, but they were
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.480]  relying on the lighting they had.
[15:41.480 --> 15:44.680]  A lot of people, I know older growers that would tell us about stealing street
[15:44.680 --> 15:47.720]  lights or older growers that would talk about stealing the lights at the gym.
[15:47.920 --> 15:51.120]  They were using whatever lights were available to them and experimenting.
[15:51.160 --> 15:54.800]  They didn't know that certain colors would do certain things to the plants.
[15:54.800 --> 15:57.680]  They didn't know that certain lights made certain color spectrums.
[15:57.680 --> 15:59.800]  They did not have any clue of that shit yet.
[15:59.800 --> 16:03.080]  They were still trying to figure out indoor cultivation from the beginning.
[16:03.560 --> 16:05.720]  So the pioneers is what we'll call them.
[16:05.800 --> 16:09.760]  The cannabis indoor pioneers were getting whatever lights were available.
[16:09.840 --> 16:11.880]  They were getting whatever dirt was available.
[16:11.880 --> 16:13.440]  We didn't have a lot of studying.
[16:13.440 --> 16:14.720]  We didn't have a lot of access.
[16:14.720 --> 16:19.600]  If you lived in rural Arizona, you were using probably rural Arizona dirt.
[16:19.600 --> 16:20.840]  You didn't have a grow store.
[16:20.840 --> 16:21.880]  You may not have a nursery.
[16:21.880 --> 16:24.960]  And if you did, like I said before, you didn't have an excuse to go buy the shit.
[16:25.280 --> 16:28.800]  So you may have to drive an hour away by something that works, you know,
[16:28.800 --> 16:32.880]  whatever grandma Betty's potting soil from whatever local farm store that
[16:32.880 --> 16:36.160]  was near you and then drive that back home an hour away so that nobody knew
[16:36.160 --> 16:39.840]  what you bought and then put your, hopefully get some seeds from somewhere.
[16:39.840 --> 16:40.840]  That's another thing.
[16:40.840 --> 16:42.880]  Where are we going to get seeds from back in the day?
[16:43.120 --> 16:45.280]  You either had to know somebody that had some seeds.
[16:45.480 --> 16:49.080]  You had to buy some weed that had seeds in it and grow those and hope for success.
[16:49.520 --> 16:53.880]  Or what a lot of people were doing is our military members were traveling overseas
[16:53.880 --> 16:57.160]  or a lot of adventurous folks were traveling overseas and they were acquiring
[16:57.160 --> 17:00.880]  seeds from farms where the cannabis was originated and they were bringing
[17:00.880 --> 17:02.040]  those seeds back here.
[17:02.440 --> 17:03.880]  Then they would get here with seeds.
[17:04.760 --> 17:05.800]  Who knows where they came from?
[17:05.800 --> 17:08.160]  All the soldiers know where they came from, but I mean, we had seeds coming from
[17:08.160 --> 17:10.120]  everywhere. We had seeds coming from Thailand.
[17:10.160 --> 17:11.640]  We had seeds coming from Afghanistan.
[17:11.640 --> 17:13.080]  We had seeds coming from Vietnam.
[17:13.080 --> 17:15.120]  We had seeds coming from Brazil.
[17:15.120 --> 17:16.760]  We probably had seeds from Morocco.
[17:16.760 --> 17:18.440]  There were seeds coming from Mexico.
[17:18.760 --> 17:21.640]  There were seeds coming from everywhere, all over the place.
[17:22.000 --> 17:23.240]  And we didn't know what we had.
[17:23.240 --> 17:24.720]  We probably had Colombian gold seeds.
[17:24.760 --> 17:27.240]  We probably had Panama red seeds.
[17:27.240 --> 17:31.080]  We probably had some Jamaican seeds, probably some Colombian, something of
[17:31.080 --> 17:34.720]  everything. But who knows what it was, unless you knew which buds it came from.
[17:34.920 --> 17:36.440]  You were just growing seeds at random.
[17:36.480 --> 17:39.520]  There was no, you couldn't Google it and say, I've got a rise seed.
[17:39.560 --> 17:41.760]  The rise is a cross of golden goat and daybreaker.
[17:41.760 --> 17:42.880]  It should take nine weeks.
[17:42.880 --> 17:44.040]  It should taste like this.
[17:44.080 --> 17:47.400]  We can fucking look at Rasta Jeff's podcast to know exactly how to grow it.
[17:47.400 --> 17:48.280]  They didn't have that shit.
[17:48.320 --> 17:51.640]  They were all experimenting and flying by the seat of their pants while they were
[17:51.640 --> 17:56.760]  getting stoned. So a lot of what we've got now, a lot of the selections were done
[17:57.160 --> 18:01.880]  through the shittiest equipment, through the shittiest sources.
[18:01.960 --> 18:03.760]  Like, where do the seeds come from?
[18:03.760 --> 18:04.880]  What equipment were they using?
[18:05.000 --> 18:06.280]  What kind of nutrients were they using?
[18:06.280 --> 18:07.520]  We didn't know much about nutrients.
[18:07.520 --> 18:10.640]  I mean, there were a few guys, I mean, people were studying, people were advanced.
[18:10.640 --> 18:13.840]  There were horticultural specialists back then, but nobody was advanced as we are
[18:13.840 --> 18:15.600]  now. And you couldn't dial shit up.
[18:15.640 --> 18:16.800]  You couldn't just click on the internet.
[18:17.000 --> 18:18.800]  You had to go to the library and read books.
[18:19.040 --> 18:21.480]  And people wouldn't go do that back in the day, especially potheads.
[18:21.480 --> 18:24.520]  If they caught a pothead at the library reading a cultivation book, they already
[18:24.520 --> 18:26.520]  know what you're doing. And you don't want to go there anyway.
[18:26.520 --> 18:27.880]  You stink like weed and you don't fit in.
[18:27.880 --> 18:31.760]  It felt weird. So a lot of our selections came from our forefathers.
[18:31.760 --> 18:36.360]  They had to select shit from random seeds, from random lighting, with random
[18:36.360 --> 18:38.040]  nutrients, with random grow equipment.
[18:38.040 --> 18:41.200]  They're probably growing with rocks and five gallon buckets under a streetlight in
[18:41.200 --> 18:42.920]  the basement, just trying to figure it all out.
[18:43.280 --> 18:44.720]  I don't know, it really got my mind thinking.
[18:45.200 --> 18:48.880]  So now we're using all of that stuff as our breeding stock now.
[18:48.880 --> 18:53.400]  All of the shit that those guys selected in the 60s and the 70s, maybe even before
[18:53.400 --> 18:55.360]  that, because cannabis has been around for a while.
[18:55.720 --> 18:59.840]  I've heard stories of way back in the day, jazz musicians would come into town.
[18:59.840 --> 19:01.880]  Let's just say that I know jazz musicians.
[19:01.880 --> 19:03.880]  They play at the club down the street after the show.
[19:04.000 --> 19:05.640]  They all come here. We smoke a little bit of weed.
[19:05.640 --> 19:07.040]  We hang out. They crash on my couch.
[19:07.040 --> 19:09.560]  They get up the next day. They go to the next state to play another gig.
[19:09.600 --> 19:11.280]  While they're here, we're going to smoke, right?
[19:11.280 --> 19:14.960]  That's just what we do. This was way back in the day before everybody had herb.
[19:15.280 --> 19:16.600]  They would leave me some seeds.
[19:16.760 --> 19:19.160]  They'd say, hey, Jeff, these seeds came out of our herb.
[19:19.360 --> 19:21.000]  I know you like to smoke. We like to smoke.
[19:21.040 --> 19:23.640]  We're going to come on tour next year because we're traveling musicians.
[19:23.640 --> 19:24.640]  It's what we do.
[19:24.640 --> 19:28.280]  We want you to grow this, grow these seeds, produce this herb.
[19:28.440 --> 19:31.800]  And then next year when we come back, you'll have more seeds and more herb for us.
[19:31.800 --> 19:35.160]  We can smoke with you. You can give us, you could probably sell us some herb if you grow it.
[19:35.160 --> 19:39.280]  I don't know how that worked. I don't know the arrangement, but you give them herb, you give them seeds.
[19:39.280 --> 19:40.720]  And then you end up with herb and seeds.
[19:40.880 --> 19:43.480]  And then they travel around and they take that herb to the next state.
[19:43.520 --> 19:45.040]  Maybe I'm in Pueblo, Colorado.
[19:45.040 --> 19:47.000]  We'll say their next gig is in fucking Santa Fe.
[19:47.240 --> 19:48.320]  They drive down to Santa Fe.
[19:48.320 --> 19:52.880]  They leave some of my new seeds that I've made with those people in Santa Fe and some weed with them.
[19:52.880 --> 19:54.120]  And they say, grow this next year.
[19:54.400 --> 19:57.440]  So everywhere they travel, they dropped off weed and seeds if they had it.
[19:57.680 --> 20:01.320]  And then every time they came back next year, weed and seeds, and they expand every year.
[20:01.320 --> 20:02.760]  They got bigger. They did more gigs.
[20:02.760 --> 20:04.840]  They didn't have to wait till Albuquerque to get to the next gig.
[20:04.840 --> 20:06.360]  They got to play in Trinidad next year.
[20:06.360 --> 20:10.760]  So now it was Pueblo, Trinidad, Albuquerque, Santa Fe, and they've got weed growing everywhere.
[20:11.200 --> 20:15.360]  That's just some stories I've heard about how people used to start getting people growing weed and having a
[20:15.360 --> 20:19.320]  suppliable, a reliable supply of cannabis for when you're traveling around.
[20:19.320 --> 20:23.000]  Old jazz musician story that was told to me by some old jazz musician cats.
[20:23.720 --> 20:28.760]  But man, think about those guys were the ones selecting your cannabis breeding strains.
[20:28.920 --> 20:30.240]  They just dropped off some seeds.
[20:30.240 --> 20:30.920]  Somebody grew it.
[20:31.160 --> 20:36.080]  And then those guys had to select from that, from that gene pool was what they got to work with.
[20:36.440 --> 20:42.280]  So we've got to either, I'm not sure, do we thank or do we blame our forefathers for the selections, which
[20:42.280 --> 20:43.120]  we're working with now?
[20:43.120 --> 20:47.680]  There were a lot of guys like Mel Frank out there doing great selections, but also there were a lot of guys
[20:47.680 --> 20:49.960]  out there in basements just doing random selections.
[20:50.520 --> 20:54.320]  And then all of that became our future gene pool, what we've gotten now.
[20:54.560 --> 21:01.120]  So all of the stuff we're working with now was based off of just really archaic equipment, archaic selections.
[21:01.360 --> 21:01.560]  I don't know.
[21:01.560 --> 21:02.800]  It really makes my brain think.
[21:03.360 --> 21:04.760]  Would selections have been different?
[21:04.760 --> 21:07.320]  Would we be working with different cannabis plants today?
[21:07.320 --> 21:08.680]  Would different shit be popular?
[21:08.680 --> 21:10.400]  Would it have taken a totally different route?
[21:10.760 --> 21:12.960]  I also think that they didn't have lab testing.
[21:12.960 --> 21:15.920]  Nobody was looking for other secondary cannabinoids.
[21:15.920 --> 21:20.800]  Everybody was focused on high THC because the only thing they had as a test was them.
[21:20.880 --> 21:22.800]  They could smoke it and go, I'm high as fuck.
[21:22.800 --> 21:24.920]  Or they could smoke it and go, nah, I didn't get high.
[21:25.120 --> 21:26.440]  That was the lab test for them.
[21:26.440 --> 21:29.600]  So we tossed out everything that didn't get you high as shit.
[21:29.600 --> 21:33.200]  If it didn't have the red eye head buzz to it that we were looking for, it went away.
[21:33.720 --> 21:38.040]  So basically I was just daydreaming and wondering how cannabis would be different if we'd done different
[21:38.040 --> 21:42.640]  selections, if we'd had different equipment, different technology, different seeds.
[21:42.840 --> 21:47.800]  Uh, just, I don't know, my brain went down that path and I thought it was a fun ramble to share with you guys.
[21:48.120 --> 21:49.840]  But that is my rant on LED lighting.
[21:49.840 --> 21:54.560]  Big shout out to my buddy Keith at Black Sale Market for hooking me up with two Canon LEDs.
[21:54.720 --> 21:58.920]  I honestly was so impressed with the first two, but I ordered three more already.
[21:59.120 --> 21:59.760]  Uh, they are here.
[21:59.760 --> 22:01.080]  They'll be hung up very soon.
[22:01.240 --> 22:04.760]  They are going to go in the mother room and the small veg space.
[22:04.800 --> 22:10.680]  And then once I see how this first room flowers out, if I'm as excited as I think I'm going to be, I will replace
[22:11.000 --> 22:15.480]  all of the lights in my personal flower space with LED lighting.
[22:15.480 --> 22:15.920]  That's right.
[22:15.920 --> 22:19.720]  I'll switch my personal grow from HPS all to LED lighting.
[22:19.840 --> 22:21.440]  The commercial grow will stay the same.
[22:21.600 --> 22:23.360]  Trust me, I'm not ready to make that leap.
[22:23.560 --> 22:29.360]  Maybe when the technology evolves a little, a little better and maybe when I'm a little more impressed with it, but not yet.
[22:29.720 --> 22:32.240]  But so far, the home grow is going to make the switch.
[22:32.520 --> 22:35.520]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I did say I was going to read a Patreon question.
[22:35.520 --> 22:37.240]  Let's jump right into that part of the show.
[22:37.400 --> 22:44.000]  If you're not supporting the show on Patreon and you'd like to learn how to do so, all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com
[22:44.000 --> 22:45.440]  forward slash grow from your heart.
[22:45.720 --> 22:48.080]  All of the information you need is right there on the screen.
[22:48.440 --> 22:52.080]  Today's Patreon message goes just like this.
[22:52.840 --> 22:55.040]  Hey, Rasta Jeff, refer to me as Smoke What?
[22:55.320 --> 22:59.640]  Because there is a possibility I could be in prohibition land, but who knows?
[23:00.000 --> 23:01.080]  I don't know nothing, bro.
[23:01.360 --> 23:05.880]  It goes on to say, I heard on your show that a few people were unable to continue their Patreon subscription.
[23:06.040 --> 23:07.320]  And lately I've been blessed.
[23:07.320 --> 23:10.480]  So I thought it is my time to step up and help a brother out.
[23:10.480 --> 23:11.920]  Hey, thank you. I appreciate that.
[23:12.400 --> 23:16.800]  If you guys aren't able to help out on Patreon during this weird COVID time, please don't stress on that.
[23:16.800 --> 23:20.480]  But I do appreciate all of the people who have stepped up during this weirdness.
[23:20.640 --> 23:24.840]  Thank you. And big thanks to our friend Smoke What? for the new Patreon support.
[23:25.640 --> 23:32.840]  His message goes on to say, I'm starting to experiment with creating some personal seeds, but I battle temps with my LEDs in small spaces.
[23:32.840 --> 23:36.880]  And I have trouble running over 400 watts and summer is right around the corner.
[23:36.880 --> 23:39.440]  Yes, it is. My friend, you better figure out how to cool that off.
[23:39.920 --> 23:43.840]  It says I don't have any questions, but the project I am starting is going to be a fun one.
[23:43.840 --> 23:46.840]  And I cannot wait to update you in a year or so.
[23:47.080 --> 23:48.320]  Bro, I look forward to the updates.
[23:48.320 --> 23:50.080]  I cannot wait to see what you do.
[23:50.080 --> 23:58.600]  It says, since I might have to wait until winter to produce any seeds, it could be an uphill battle, reaching some of my goals until we find some legalization here.
[23:58.840 --> 24:00.640]  And I can stretch out a bit.
[24:00.840 --> 24:02.200]  Bro, don't get yourself in trouble.
[24:02.200 --> 24:07.840]  And my advice is if it's going to be an uphill battle, wait until the winter because you don't want to make struggle seeds.
[24:08.080 --> 24:16.520]  Now, there is another paragraph here, and it says, one thing I thought might be a good idea is to collect genetics for when my state opens up to the legal markets.
[24:16.800 --> 24:24.840]  What would you suggest for strains that are either overlooked in the legal community or ones that possibly never made it into the legal cannabis markets?
[24:25.160 --> 24:33.000]  I have the most I have most of the popular ones in your collection, but I don't know much about other strains out there, despite there being epic strains everywhere.
[24:33.360 --> 24:39.600]  I'm thinking of something that I can bring to the grows that lack the product, the product to fill them when legalization passes.
[24:39.880 --> 24:44.880]  It says anyways, until next time, stay iry, hug your mom and take a fat dab for me.
[24:45.120 --> 24:48.320]  Emphasis on the dabs because concentrates are too illegal here.
[24:48.480 --> 24:53.800]  And I don't want to risk the 10 to 20 year lodging they offer for having them.
[24:53.800 --> 24:54.800]  Holy shit.
[24:55.160 --> 24:56.800]  That puts life into perspective, dude.
[24:57.720 --> 25:01.760]  This person said 10 to 20 years for possession of concentrates where they are.
[25:02.000 --> 25:07.760]  And I have got four, eight, 12, and there is at least 20 grams of concentrate sitting here on the table.
[25:08.440 --> 25:10.080]  Bro, that puts shit into perspective.
[25:10.120 --> 25:13.160]  I am blessed. I'm thankful to be here to be able to take these dabs.
[25:13.400 --> 25:16.160]  I will for sure take a fat dab for you, my friend Smoke What.
[25:16.520 --> 25:18.560]  Now, let's focus on the question here.
[25:19.160 --> 25:22.400]  Smoke What asked, they want to start saving genetics.
[25:22.440 --> 25:26.320]  They want to have genetics ready for when legalization happens in their area.
[25:26.520 --> 25:29.320]  They want to be able to put quality genetics into a dispensary.
[25:29.600 --> 25:36.640]  And they want to know what I would suggest for strains that are either overlooked or possibly never made it into legal cannabis markets.
[25:36.680 --> 25:38.040]  That's a really good question.
[25:40.080 --> 25:45.640]  Strains that never made it that are often overlooked are kind of some of the older strains that people ask for.
[25:45.680 --> 25:52.280]  You're going to get if you open a dispensary and you start getting traffic, you're going to get an older demographic that will ask for
[25:52.680 --> 25:58.960]  stuff like Acapulco Gold and Colombian Gold and the Panama Red and stuff like that.
[25:59.000 --> 26:00.000]  They're going to want that stuff.
[26:00.040 --> 26:03.560]  The older, like the veteran age guys are going to want that shit.
[26:03.960 --> 26:09.840]  Then there's going to be another crowd that comes in and they're going to want Durban Poison and White Widow and Trainwreck.
[26:10.120 --> 26:11.600]  That is a generational thing.
[26:12.160 --> 26:17.120]  Then after that, you're going to get people that come in and want Sour Diesel and Chemdog and OG Kush.
[26:17.360 --> 26:18.840]  That's another generational thing.
[26:18.840 --> 26:27.480]  Then right after that, you're going to get people that want all of the Wedding Cake and Cake Bomb and fucking Girl Scout Cookies and all the Girl Scout Cookies outcrosses.
[26:27.520 --> 26:28.920]  That shit's going to happen also.
[26:29.600 --> 26:34.520]  It is really hard to fill all of the needs for a dispensary for the shelves.
[26:36.160 --> 26:41.280]  You kind of asked me to mention things that were overlooked or things that have been forgotten about.
[26:41.920 --> 26:46.640]  Like I said before, the Panamas, the Acapulcos, the Colombians, those things missed the dispensary.
[26:46.680 --> 26:49.480]  They never made it into the dispensary, but there's probably a reason.
[26:50.760 --> 26:53.920]  In a commercial environment, you've got to meet goals.
[26:53.960 --> 26:57.160]  You've got to reach production goals and that has to be a schedule.
[26:57.560 --> 27:02.240]  If the plants take 11 or 12 weeks to flower, they're probably not going to make it in a commercial grow.
[27:02.280 --> 27:03.480]  I need nine weekers.
[27:04.280 --> 27:08.640]  If it takes eight to 10 weeks, I'm going to run it nine weeks to fit into my schedules.
[27:08.680 --> 27:14.960]  And that plant, if it wants to go nine, if it survives, if it makes everybody happy, that qualifies for the commercial grow.
[27:15.360 --> 27:16.920]  It's got to put out weight.
[27:17.200 --> 27:18.760]  It's got to hit harvest goals.
[27:19.040 --> 27:20.560]  Most of my plants hit certain weights.
[27:20.600 --> 27:23.040]  If they don't hit enough weight, I'm not going to reach goals.
[27:23.080 --> 27:24.320]  I'm not going to get bonuses.
[27:24.360 --> 27:26.120]  We're not going to have enough medicine for the shelves.
[27:26.160 --> 27:27.160]  Nobody will be happy.
[27:27.360 --> 27:29.240]  I cannot keep that plant in the facility.
[27:29.240 --> 27:29.960]  It's got to go.
[27:30.000 --> 27:31.960]  So it's got to reach the weight goals.
[27:32.000 --> 27:34.520]  It has also got to reach potency goals.
[27:34.800 --> 27:40.160]  If it puts out a whole bunch of weed in nine weeks, but when people smoke it, nobody gets high, that plant's got to go.
[27:40.360 --> 27:41.640]  So it's got to flower on time.
[27:41.840 --> 27:42.800]  It's got to put out weight.
[27:42.880 --> 27:43.800]  It's got to be potent.
[27:44.040 --> 27:45.360]  It's also got to sell.
[27:45.400 --> 27:47.360]  When I put it on the shelf, does it go anywhere?
[27:47.720 --> 27:52.520]  There are probably 70 strains in a lot of my commercial production facilities.
[27:52.560 --> 27:57.840]  We have somewhere between 50 and 70 mother plants per commercial cultivation facility.
[27:58.080 --> 28:00.280]  There is a reason for each and every one of them.
[28:00.520 --> 28:08.920]  If one of them slows down or doesn't have momentum on the shelf, if it sits there for long enough to where the time I grow the next batch, if they've still got some of that, I don't grow it anymore.
[28:08.960 --> 28:09.840]  That plant gets cold.
[28:09.880 --> 28:11.280]  We remove that from the system.
[28:11.600 --> 28:12.200]  Bye bye.
[28:12.400 --> 28:14.680]  It doesn't work for a commercial cultivation facility.
[28:15.080 --> 28:21.480]  So there are a lot of things to think about when you're trying to select genetics for a commercial cultivation facility.
[28:22.000 --> 28:25.640]  Um, everybody, every dispensary should have something fruity.
[28:26.360 --> 28:29.600]  Whether it's like a, I'm saying fruity, you want fruity flavors.
[28:29.600 --> 28:32.320]  If it's blue dream or golden goat that qualifies as fruity.
[28:32.680 --> 28:34.600]  Everybody needs a berry flavor.
[28:34.600 --> 28:38.440]  If it's blueberry, if it's cherry, you need some kind of berries in there, a berry mix.
[28:38.440 --> 28:39.920]  You need fruit, you need berries.
[28:40.400 --> 28:41.480]  Uh, you need floral.
[28:41.560 --> 28:43.840]  I think every dispensary needs something floral.
[28:43.840 --> 28:45.480]  It's got to smell like sweet flowers.
[28:45.480 --> 28:47.480]  Girls love that floral smell and shit.
[28:47.480 --> 28:48.600]  Some guys love it too.
[28:48.880 --> 28:50.840]  So you need fruit berries and floral.
[28:51.160 --> 28:54.720]  That could be one strain that covers all of those and hopefully they don't catch on.
[28:54.880 --> 28:58.560]  But if you've got three strains to cover fruit, berries, and floral, you're in business.
[28:58.880 --> 29:03.160]  Also, every dispensary needs something that smells gassy and or fuely.
[29:03.440 --> 29:09.200]  Sour diesel, uh, chem DI 95, something in that fuely, funky, gassy kind of range.
[29:09.520 --> 29:11.600]  We also need some earthy smelling shit.
[29:11.600 --> 29:16.480]  Something like OG Kush, something like a, a Bubba Kush, a pre 98 Bubba, something in
[29:16.480 --> 29:18.920]  that realm, uh, something like the GMO.
[29:19.120 --> 29:20.160]  We need stuff like that.
[29:20.160 --> 29:25.360]  So you need fruit berries, floral gas, and earth is something that I think all
[29:25.360 --> 29:27.920]  dispensaries require required to have on their shelf.
[29:27.920 --> 29:30.120]  That is your basic shopping area right there.
[29:30.680 --> 29:34.440]  Uh, then after that, people are going to ask for your highest lab tests.
[29:34.480 --> 29:35.880]  It's all about the lab tests.
[29:35.880 --> 29:39.120]  So if you've got something that tests real high in the labs, that is a really
[29:39.120 --> 29:40.240]  good thing to put on the shelf.
[29:40.240 --> 29:43.080]  Put that 35% THC sticker on there.
[29:43.320 --> 29:44.960]  They'll walk in, they'll be drawn to that sticker.
[29:44.960 --> 29:45.720]  They'll buy that shit.
[29:45.720 --> 29:47.040]  They won't ask any other questions.
[29:47.040 --> 29:47.920]  That's what people want.
[29:48.440 --> 29:51.760]  People want something with a really strong head buzz.
[29:51.760 --> 29:55.000]  When I walk in, I want the thing that's going to make me go, Oh shit, I'm having a
[29:55.000 --> 29:55.680]  panic attack.
[29:55.760 --> 29:57.000]  That's the weed I want.
[29:57.240 --> 29:59.640]  So have something with a really strong head buzz.
[30:00.120 --> 30:02.640]  Have something with a really strong body buzz.
[30:02.800 --> 30:04.560]  You're going to find people that want to relax.
[30:04.600 --> 30:05.760]  People that want to take a nap.
[30:05.760 --> 30:07.920]  People that are high strung and need to chill the fuck out.
[30:08.240 --> 30:10.120]  They need something with that body buzz.
[30:10.840 --> 30:14.240]  You may find people that want something with high CBD.
[30:14.240 --> 30:16.080]  I mentioned before they want high THC.
[30:16.080 --> 30:17.360]  What they want that lab test.
[30:17.360 --> 30:18.760]  That's really appealing to people.
[30:19.040 --> 30:21.720]  Also CBD is very popular right now.
[30:21.880 --> 30:25.000]  So you may want to find a strain that is high in CBD.
[30:25.040 --> 30:28.760]  Those lab tests go a long way in a retail market.
[30:28.760 --> 30:32.440]  So put the lab numbers on the jars, have the lab numbers available to where people
[30:32.440 --> 30:33.160]  can see them.
[30:33.360 --> 30:34.320]  They'll see that number.
[30:34.440 --> 30:37.000]  They'll forget everything they were talking about or saying or thinking.
[30:37.000 --> 30:39.320]  And they'll go, I want that 35% jar.
[30:39.560 --> 30:41.120]  And then they'll buy that and you make money.
[30:41.120 --> 30:43.160]  So a lab test really helped a lot.
[30:43.160 --> 30:45.280]  Something high THC, high CBD.
[30:45.640 --> 30:48.680]  Also think about the other cannabinoids which are becoming popular.
[30:48.680 --> 30:50.800]  THC V is really popular right now.
[30:50.800 --> 30:52.920]  People are looking for THC V products.
[30:52.920 --> 30:56.920]  If you can find a strain high in V, put that on your shelf, brag about it,
[30:56.960 --> 31:00.680]  advertise about it because it is not a super popular trait right now, but people
[31:00.680 --> 31:01.240]  want that.
[31:01.920 --> 31:04.040]  Uh, something else you're going to need to have on the strain.
[31:04.040 --> 31:06.440]  OG Kush and OG Kush crosses.
[31:06.440 --> 31:08.240]  Everybody wants some sort of a Kush.
[31:08.240 --> 31:14.080]  We need that stanky OG Kush aroma, whether it's, uh, an OG cross, a straight
[31:14.080 --> 31:14.760]  up OG.
[31:14.760 --> 31:17.560]  If you've got a Kush on the shelf, people will be drawn to that.
[31:17.600 --> 31:21.680]  A lot of the younger kids, the gangster guys, they heard Kush in a rap song.
[31:21.680 --> 31:22.920]  They're going to come by Kush.
[31:23.360 --> 31:24.040]  Uh, diesel.
[31:24.040 --> 31:26.360]  I mentioned before, diesel is popular.
[31:26.360 --> 31:30.320]  You need a diesel, but don't embarrass yourself and grow something that says
[31:30.320 --> 31:33.560]  diesel and does not smell like diesel at all, because we will call you out.
[31:33.560 --> 31:34.640]  We'll say that's not diesel.
[31:34.640 --> 31:35.880]  That smells like berries and fruit.
[31:36.120 --> 31:37.120]  We want diesel.
[31:37.120 --> 31:39.040]  So get a real diesel.
[31:39.200 --> 31:41.880]  If not, don't waste your time because it will be embarrassing.
[31:41.880 --> 31:45.880]  Chem D I 95, sour diesel, something like that will make you real happy.
[31:46.200 --> 31:51.120]  Uh, chem, we need some chem dog genetics on every shelf at every dispensary.
[31:51.400 --> 31:52.840]  You've got so many options for chem.
[31:52.840 --> 31:56.840]  You got chem 91, you got chem D, you got chem four, you got chem sister.
[31:57.080 --> 31:58.680]  Put some chem dog on the shelf.
[31:58.720 --> 31:59.920]  Everybody loves chem dog.
[31:59.920 --> 32:00.920]  That shit will sell.
[32:01.360 --> 32:02.840]  Uh, also it'll make you stand out.
[32:02.840 --> 32:05.200]  Not a lot of people can grow some really fire chem dog.
[32:05.200 --> 32:07.680]  If you've got the chem and it's doing the job, right, it
[32:07.680 --> 32:09.000]  will make everybody happy.
[32:10.120 --> 32:11.720]  Then here are some things you need to think about.
[32:11.920 --> 32:15.320]  What kind of, and I'm, I'm thinking that you're opening a dispensary and I'm
[32:15.320 --> 32:16.760]  kind of thinking down the road for you.
[32:17.000 --> 32:19.840]  What type of vibe do you want your dispensary to have?
[32:20.080 --> 32:23.680]  If you stock the stuff like the Acapulco gold and that Panama red and the
[32:23.680 --> 32:27.680]  Colombian gold and shit, you're going to bring in an older veteran type of crowd.
[32:27.920 --> 32:30.520]  If you've got the OG Kush and the sour diesel, you're going to
[32:30.520 --> 32:32.160]  bring in a younger type of crowd.
[32:32.720 --> 32:35.680]  Do you want to cater to medical patients?
[32:35.840 --> 32:37.920]  Do you want to cater to the hype crowd?
[32:38.040 --> 32:41.320]  You kind of get to decide that by the atmosphere, the ambiance, the
[32:41.320 --> 32:44.080]  environment, and the products, which you stock at your dispensary.
[32:44.440 --> 32:46.200]  So do you want to carry the hype shit?
[32:46.440 --> 32:48.480]  Do you want to have, I don't even know the new hype shit.
[32:48.480 --> 32:52.520]  Do you want to have gelato 44 and cake bomb and cherry cake and wedding pie?
[32:52.520 --> 32:54.080]  Do you want to have all that shit on the shelf?
[32:54.320 --> 32:56.200]  That's going to bring all the youngsters in there.
[32:56.200 --> 32:59.520]  That's going to bring all the hip kids, all the hype beats, all the youngsters,
[32:59.800 --> 33:02.200]  all the Instagram kids, they're all going to come in for that stuff.
[33:02.200 --> 33:05.600]  You can have a shop like cookies where you just got flow in all day, or you
[33:05.600 --> 33:08.920]  can have a little quaint shop that is kind of up to you, so do you want that?
[33:08.920 --> 33:09.520]  Hype shit?
[33:09.880 --> 33:11.320]  Uh, you can get that if you want it.
[33:11.480 --> 33:13.440]  It will bring the hype crowd.
[33:13.760 --> 33:15.040]  Do you want that older stuff?
[33:15.040 --> 33:19.120]  The Acapulco gold, the Panama red, that is going to bring you that older crowd.
[33:19.440 --> 33:23.400]  Sometimes you may notice that young hype crowd and that old veteran crowd,
[33:23.560 --> 33:25.520]  they don't blend perfectly well together.
[33:25.520 --> 33:27.120]  It's not the best marketing strategy.
[33:27.120 --> 33:29.640]  That may sound crazy because they both got money in their pockets.
[33:29.640 --> 33:32.800]  They're all buying herb, but you've got to set the environment that
[33:32.800 --> 33:34.240]  you expect for your dispensary.
[33:34.600 --> 33:35.760]  It you'll see what I mean.
[33:36.000 --> 33:37.160]  It's a niche thing.
[33:37.320 --> 33:41.160]  If you've got the Acapulco gold and the fucking cake bomb, you'll get a good
[33:41.160 --> 33:41.600]  crowd.
[33:41.680 --> 33:43.840]  It's hard to keep it balanced out of what stays on the shelf.
[33:44.000 --> 33:45.400]  You've only got so much shelf space.
[33:45.400 --> 33:46.520]  You've only got so many plants.
[33:46.520 --> 33:47.880]  There's a lot of thinking to do.
[33:48.160 --> 33:50.080]  So which kind of crowd do you want to bring?
[33:50.240 --> 33:51.880]  What kind of atmosphere do you want to invent?
[33:52.160 --> 33:53.680]  Uh, what type of products do you want to offer?
[33:53.680 --> 33:54.760]  That is all up to you.
[33:55.120 --> 33:58.600]  Um, I said before, everybody's going to want a Girl Scout cookies cross,
[33:58.600 --> 34:01.960]  especially right when you open up in a new market, everybody has heard about
[34:01.960 --> 34:02.800]  Girl Scout cookies.
[34:02.800 --> 34:03.480]  They're going to come in.
[34:03.480 --> 34:04.440]  They're going to want cookies.
[34:04.880 --> 34:06.680]  The same as I said about sour diesel.
[34:07.360 --> 34:11.040]  If you've got a real Girl Scout cookies cut, if you've got the form cut, if
[34:11.040 --> 34:14.600]  you've got the thin mint cut, put that shit on the shelf at the dispensary.
[34:14.600 --> 34:18.200]  If you've got a knockoff Girl Scout cookies, if you've got a bag seed, if
[34:18.200 --> 34:20.960]  you've got something that you bought from seeds from somebody and it came out
[34:20.960 --> 34:23.880]  questionable, not a hundred percent Girl Scout cookies, don't put it on the
[34:23.920 --> 34:28.080]  shelf because an experienced connoisseur smoker will come in there.
[34:28.320 --> 34:30.560]  They'll look at it and they'll go, that is not Girl Scout cookies.
[34:30.680 --> 34:31.600]  Your place is whack.
[34:31.680 --> 34:32.560]  They will leave.
[34:32.760 --> 34:36.080]  If you're trying to say you got sour D and it's not sour D I'm leaving.
[34:36.240 --> 34:39.160]  If you try to say you got Girl Scout cookies and it's not Girl Scout cookies,
[34:39.280 --> 34:40.000]  I'm fucking leave it.
[34:40.000 --> 34:44.040]  Make sure if you're selling and displaying a hype strain, make sure it is grown and
[34:44.040 --> 34:45.240]  displayed properly.
[34:45.240 --> 34:46.800]  And that it is really what you're saying.
[34:46.800 --> 34:47.040]  It is.
[34:47.040 --> 34:48.000]  A lot of us can tell.
[34:48.320 --> 34:51.960]  I can look at Girl Scout cookies, buds and tell you nope.
[34:52.040 --> 34:53.680]  Or, Oh yeah.
[34:53.800 --> 34:54.800]  I can tell by the look.
[34:54.800 --> 34:55.840]  I can tell by the smell.
[34:55.880 --> 34:56.760]  I can crack it open.
[34:56.760 --> 34:57.720]  I can tell by the texture.
[34:57.760 --> 34:59.400]  I know Girl Scout cookies very well.
[34:59.600 --> 35:02.120]  Most connoisseurs do know the cookies very well.
[35:02.280 --> 35:04.360]  And we will call you if you're fucking with us.
[35:04.680 --> 35:06.320]  So people are going to want Girl Scout cookies.
[35:06.320 --> 35:07.600]  They're going to want train wreck.
[35:07.800 --> 35:10.520]  They're going to want anything with the word cake in it.
[35:10.720 --> 35:14.760]  Cake bomb, wedding cake, a rise cake that doesn't exist, but I'm sure it would
[35:14.760 --> 35:16.080]  fucking sell if it existed.
[35:16.320 --> 35:18.000]  The gelatos, things like that.
[35:18.000 --> 35:20.440]  Biscotti, all that popular stuff is going to sell.
[35:20.760 --> 35:24.160]  It is all about kind of what you want to put on the dispensary shelf.
[35:24.320 --> 35:26.880]  Kind of all about what you want to put in your cultivation.
[35:26.880 --> 35:27.800]  What goes in the trays?
[35:27.800 --> 35:28.640]  What goes in the rooms?
[35:28.640 --> 35:29.800]  What grows well for you?
[35:30.160 --> 35:31.120]  It's got to grow well.
[35:31.120 --> 35:32.880]  It's got to produce, it's got to hit numbers.
[35:33.080 --> 35:35.200]  It's got to be not a pain in the ass to trim.
[35:35.200 --> 35:37.400]  If it slows down the trim crew too much, get rid of it.
[35:37.680 --> 35:40.600]  If it messes up any of your flow, it needs to go.
[35:40.600 --> 35:43.960]  If it works well for everything from the beginning to the end, if it goes from the
[35:43.960 --> 35:47.680]  seed to the cash register without problems, put that shit on the shelf,
[35:47.680 --> 35:48.800]  put that shit in the grow.
[35:49.120 --> 35:51.800]  But it also has to make all of the consumers happy.
[35:51.800 --> 35:56.040]  So you have to kind of decide what ends up happening as people set up
[35:56.040 --> 35:59.480]  dispensaries, kind of based on like my breeding is based on what I enjoy.
[35:59.640 --> 36:02.040]  My dispensary would be filled with strains that I enjoy.
[36:02.040 --> 36:06.240]  I would attract a crowd similar to myself that smokes and enjoys things that I
[36:06.240 --> 36:06.600]  enjoy.
[36:06.600 --> 36:11.040]  The demographic would end up being probably 25 to 45 year old dudes that listen to
[36:11.040 --> 36:12.160]  reggae and have dreadlocks.
[36:12.160 --> 36:14.680]  That'd be a big part of my demographic at my dispensary.
[36:15.040 --> 36:16.000]  But that, that would be cool with me.
[36:16.000 --> 36:17.200]  Cause that's who I hang out with.
[36:17.200 --> 36:18.440]  I want everybody to come and shop.
[36:18.440 --> 36:22.280]  But I mean the main core would just be 25 to 40 year old dudes with dreadlocks
[36:22.280 --> 36:24.520]  listening to reggae music on their way to band practice.
[36:24.680 --> 36:25.600]  Probably who would stop by.
[36:26.080 --> 36:26.280]  All right.
[36:26.560 --> 36:29.000]  Um, so it's all up to you what you want to put in the dispensary.
[36:29.160 --> 36:30.040]  It's got to work in the grow.
[36:30.040 --> 36:31.040]  It's got to work on the shelves.
[36:31.040 --> 36:32.680]  It's got to work for the consumers.
[36:33.120 --> 36:35.680]  I think I gave you a pretty good rundown of all the basics.
[36:35.920 --> 36:41.880]  Fruit, berries, floral gas, a head buzz, body buzz, THC, CBD, maybe some THC V.
[36:42.120 --> 36:44.280]  I need OG Kush, sour diesel, chem dog.
[36:44.600 --> 36:46.440]  You want those old things for the old guys.
[36:46.440 --> 36:49.520]  If you can get it in there or maybe you don't, if it doesn't work in the garden,
[36:49.520 --> 36:51.520]  maybe there's a reason why that shit is not around.
[36:51.880 --> 36:55.280]  Do you want to work with the hype shit and how do you want your menu to look?
[36:55.560 --> 36:55.840]  All right.
[36:55.840 --> 36:57.280]  I think I really covered your message.
[36:57.600 --> 36:59.360]  Uh, let me make sure there's nothing I'm missing in here
[36:59.360 --> 37:01.120]  because this did come from Patreon.

[38:45.080 --> 38:46.000]  I think that is it.
[38:46.040 --> 38:48.400]  I want to give a giant shout out to my buddy, Kes Burton.
