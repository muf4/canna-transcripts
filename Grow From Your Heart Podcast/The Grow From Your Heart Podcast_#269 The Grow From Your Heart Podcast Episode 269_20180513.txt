[03:22.460 --> 03:23.460]  Welcome to the podcast, my friend.
[03:23.460 --> 03:24.460]  Thank you.
[03:24.460 --> 03:25.460]  Thank you.
[03:25.460 --> 03:26.460]  Man, thanks for reaching out.
[03:26.460 --> 03:27.460]  You reached out to me on Facebook and asked to come on the show.
[03:27.460 --> 03:28.460]  I love it when people do that.
[03:28.460 --> 03:29.460]  I appreciate it.
[03:29.460 --> 03:30.460]  Welcome to the show.
[03:30.460 --> 03:31.460]  Thank you.
[03:31.460 --> 03:32.460]  Thank you for having me.
[03:32.460 --> 03:35.460]  Sitting to my number right, number four, microphone number four.
[03:35.460 --> 03:37.460]  I don't know where that is over there.
[03:37.460 --> 03:38.460]  It's kind of my front right-ish.
[03:38.460 --> 03:39.460]  Your number right?
[03:39.460 --> 03:40.460]  My number right.
[03:40.460 --> 03:41.460]  My number, yeah.
[03:41.460 --> 03:42.460]  We're going to get there.
[03:42.460 --> 03:43.460]  We're all high.
[03:43.460 --> 03:44.460]  I just took like a half gram snake dab a minute ago.
[03:44.460 --> 03:45.460]  It's been that kind of day.
[03:45.460 --> 03:47.460]  Over there on microphone number four, trolling me already.
[03:47.460 --> 03:48.460]  Hi.
[03:48.460 --> 03:49.460]  It is Lindsey, the traveling stoner.
[03:49.460 --> 03:50.460]  Welcome to the podcast, honey.
[03:50.460 --> 03:51.460]  Thank you.
[03:51.460 --> 03:52.460]  Thanks for coming back and joining us.
[03:52.460 --> 03:54.460]  Thank you for calling me and asking me to come over.
[03:54.460 --> 03:57.460]  Hey, when I realized there was an open mic, I was like, let's get Lindsey over here.
[03:57.460 --> 03:58.460]  I was super stoked.
[03:58.460 --> 04:00.460]  I just picked up food and I was like, nah, nevermind.
[04:00.460 --> 04:01.460]  We're going to Jeff's.
[04:01.460 --> 04:04.460]  This joint is running like Usain Bolt.
[04:04.460 --> 04:06.460]  If you want to fix that when I pass it to you.
[04:06.460 --> 04:07.460]  Thank you, sir.
[04:07.460 --> 04:08.460]  All right.
[04:08.460 --> 04:09.460]  So welcome to the podcast, everybody.
[04:09.460 --> 04:10.460]  Everybody listening.
[04:10.460 --> 04:11.460]  Thank you for joining us.
[04:11.460 --> 04:12.460]  There's a lot going on.
[04:12.460 --> 04:15.460]  Before I get to that, I want to talk a little bit about my weekend.
[04:15.460 --> 04:19.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, I had a good friend bless me with a front row ticket to Reggae
[04:19.460 --> 04:20.460]  on the Rocks.
[04:20.460 --> 04:24.460]  If you've never been front row at Reggae on the Rocks, that's a damn experience.
[04:24.460 --> 04:25.460]  Go check that out.
[04:25.460 --> 04:26.460]  It's different.
[04:26.460 --> 04:27.460]  It's way different.
[04:27.460 --> 04:28.460]  What do you got to say?
[04:28.460 --> 04:29.460]  Let's go for it.
[04:29.460 --> 04:31.460]  I just bought my first concert tickets to Red Rocks today.
[04:31.460 --> 04:35.460]  Actually, are we going to see I'm going to see G-Eazy on the 22nd.
[04:35.460 --> 04:36.460]  I have.
[04:36.460 --> 04:37.460]  So I'm old.
[04:37.460 --> 04:38.460]  No, I have no idea.
[04:38.460 --> 04:39.460]  It's not just me.
[04:39.460 --> 04:40.460]  OK, cool.
[04:40.460 --> 04:43.460]  Yes, you three make me laugh.
[04:43.460 --> 04:47.460]  Mike and I were discussing earlier that how we're in a way different music than a lot
[04:47.460 --> 04:48.460]  of people.
[04:48.460 --> 04:50.460]  Mike's like 10 years older than everybody he works with.
[04:50.460 --> 04:53.460]  I probably I'm the same age as Mike, 10 years older than most.
[04:53.460 --> 04:56.460]  I usually have funny looks when I take over the radio at work.
[04:56.460 --> 04:58.460]  I'm used to it by now.
[04:58.460 --> 04:59.460]  It's been happening for a while.
[04:59.460 --> 05:03.460]  Well, that's funny because I had a front row ticket and the headlining band was Mike's
[05:03.460 --> 05:05.460]  favorite band, which is 311.
[05:05.460 --> 05:06.460]  Love it.
[05:06.460 --> 05:08.460]  Guess how much of 311 I stuck around for?
[05:08.460 --> 05:09.460]  Not a second.
[05:09.460 --> 05:10.460]  Not a second.
[05:10.460 --> 05:12.460]  So the band that I wanted to see.
[05:12.460 --> 05:13.460]  I probably did.
[05:13.460 --> 05:14.460]  I probably did.
[05:14.460 --> 05:15.460]  I'm not into 311.
[05:15.460 --> 05:17.460]  They set it off at Red Rocks.
[05:17.460 --> 05:19.460]  That's one of their favorite places to play.
[05:19.460 --> 05:20.460]  And it's one of the best venues in the country.
[05:20.460 --> 05:22.460]  It is one of the best venues in the country.
[05:22.460 --> 05:23.460]  I'm a spoiled brat.
[05:23.460 --> 05:27.460]  I've probably seen 30 Red Rocks concerts and that's no joke.
[05:27.460 --> 05:29.460]  Probably 15 of them were widespread panic.
[05:29.460 --> 05:33.460]  I was working that night and I caught a couple of clicks on Facebook.
[05:33.460 --> 05:35.460]  It was like, oh, I wish I was there.
[05:35.460 --> 05:41.460]  I remember that you would probably had just left the lot as those videos were being posted.
[05:41.460 --> 05:42.460]  Yes.
[05:42.460 --> 05:44.460]  So I get to see I get to see Morgan Heritage.
[05:44.460 --> 05:47.460]  That's most of the people that listen to the podcast frequently know that my favorite reggae
[05:47.460 --> 05:49.460]  band currently it will change.
[05:49.460 --> 05:50.460]  It does just my taste change.
[05:50.460 --> 05:52.460]  I'll hear something that will catch my attention.
[05:52.460 --> 05:55.460]  But Morgan Heritage has been my favorite reggae band for a couple of few months here.
[05:55.460 --> 05:57.460]  Probably the past year or so.
[05:57.460 --> 05:58.460]  They were awesome.
[05:58.460 --> 06:01.460]  They played at 445.
[06:01.460 --> 06:02.460]  I got to catch most of their set.
[06:02.460 --> 06:04.460]  They sounded fantastic.
[06:04.460 --> 06:07.460]  They played a bunch of new shit that I didn't know which was kind of cool.
[06:07.460 --> 06:10.460]  I kind of wanted to hear some familiar shit like, you know, you want to hear your favorites,
[06:10.460 --> 06:12.460]  but I also like seeing them.
[06:12.460 --> 06:14.460]  They do kind of a jam band thing.
[06:14.460 --> 06:17.460]  They start off with one song and they don't stop till about halfway through their set and
[06:17.460 --> 06:19.460]  they just segue song to song to song.
[06:19.460 --> 06:20.460]  So that was kind of neat.
[06:20.460 --> 06:21.460]  They kind of did a medley.
[06:22.460 --> 06:24.460]  What's your favorite song by them Jeff?
[06:24.460 --> 06:26.460]  It really depends on the mood.
[06:26.460 --> 06:27.460]  I'm in.
[06:27.460 --> 06:28.460]  That's a good question.
[06:28.460 --> 06:32.460]  Right now like not like this moment, but I guess in this realm of time, I'd probably
[06:32.460 --> 06:36.460]  throw on like Joss seed is one of my favorite songs by them.
[06:36.460 --> 06:38.460]  But then strictly roots is also a good one.
[06:38.460 --> 06:41.460]  And then there's a bunch of like remixes that they do because they're a reggae artist.
[06:41.460 --> 06:46.460]  So it's always yeah, they'll put out a single all the time, but strictly roots is a great
[06:46.460 --> 06:47.460]  one.
[06:48.460 --> 06:49.460]  So I got to see them.
[06:49.460 --> 06:53.460]  They ended and I was in the front row and I looked back toward the sound booth just
[06:53.460 --> 06:56.460]  looking into the crowd and I see one of the band members hanging out and I was like, oh,
[06:56.460 --> 06:57.460]  he's over there.
[06:57.460 --> 06:59.460]  I was like, I'm not going to go bug him, but he's right there.
[06:59.460 --> 07:03.460]  And I turned around and his brother Peter Morgan was walking right past me.
[07:03.460 --> 07:06.460]  And Peter Morgan is probably my favorite reggae singer.
[07:06.460 --> 07:09.460]  If I could sound like anybody, if I could sing like a reggae artist and probably be
[07:09.460 --> 07:10.460]  Peter Morgan.
[07:10.460 --> 07:12.460]  I know that sounds really weird because he's got a high pitch kind of voice.
[07:12.460 --> 07:15.460]  He's kind of squeaky, but that dude could fucking sing.
[07:15.460 --> 07:19.460]  And if I want to, if I could sound like anybody, probably be him, him or Richie Spice.
[07:19.460 --> 07:22.460]  But that's just the kind of reggae voice I wish I had.
[07:22.460 --> 07:23.460]  I know I don't, but it's cool.
[07:23.460 --> 07:24.460]  But that dude walked right past me.
[07:24.460 --> 07:27.460]  So I just put my hand on his shoulder and that dude is beefy, bro.
[07:27.460 --> 07:29.460]  Like, you know, when he touched some people, they kind of move.
[07:29.460 --> 07:30.460]  That dude did not move.
[07:30.460 --> 07:31.460]  He's one stout fucking Jamaican.
[07:31.460 --> 07:34.460]  But I put my hand on his shoulder and I was like, bro, thank you.
[07:34.460 --> 07:37.460]  And he just turned around and looked me straight in my eyes and he stuck out his right hand
[07:37.460 --> 07:39.460]  and he shook my hand and he said, respect.
[07:39.460 --> 07:41.460]  And then he kept on walking because he didn't want to get mobbed.
[07:41.460 --> 07:44.460]  You know, if I would have stood there for three seconds, he would have got crowded.
[07:44.460 --> 07:45.460]  So he just kept on moving.
[07:45.460 --> 07:46.460]  So that was cool.
[07:46.460 --> 07:50.460]  I got to meet pretty much my favorite reggae singer at Reggae on the Rocks.
[07:50.460 --> 07:51.460]  That was awesome.
[07:51.460 --> 07:54.460]  So he walked by, time went on and then Steel Pulse came on.
[07:54.460 --> 07:57.460]  Steel Pulse might be my number two favorite reggae artist.
[07:57.460 --> 07:58.460]  So it was great seeing them.
[07:59.460 --> 08:00.460]  I'm heading to joint, you guys.
[08:04.460 --> 08:07.460]  Steel Pulse was great, but they were a little slow.
[08:07.460 --> 08:09.460]  Everything just seemed a touch slow.
[08:09.460 --> 08:10.460]  They're getting fucking old.
[08:10.460 --> 08:13.460]  Like all the dreadlocks are super gray in Steel Pulse.
[08:13.460 --> 08:14.460]  Those dreads are getting gray.
[08:14.460 --> 08:16.460]  They're really long, but they're getting gray.
[08:16.460 --> 08:20.460]  So shout out to my anonymous friend who got me up front row there at Reggae on the Rocks.
[08:20.460 --> 08:21.460]  I truly do appreciate that.
[08:21.460 --> 08:22.460]  That was a good fucking time.
[08:22.460 --> 08:23.460]  I'll never forget it.
[08:23.460 --> 08:24.460]  Thank you.
[08:24.460 --> 08:26.460]  So Reggae on the Rocks.
[08:26.460 --> 08:28.460]  Oh, I got to keep going.
[08:28.460 --> 08:30.460]  The band after that was Iration.
[08:30.460 --> 08:31.460]  I listened to about a song.
[08:31.460 --> 08:32.460]  Hey, don't stop.
[08:32.460 --> 08:34.460]  I listened to about a song and a half and then I was like, let's get the fuck out of here.
[08:34.460 --> 08:35.460]  And we left.
[08:35.460 --> 08:37.460]  Iration was not entertaining me one bit.
[08:37.460 --> 08:38.460]  I didn't like the sound.
[08:38.460 --> 08:40.460]  If you like Iration, I apologize.
[08:41.460 --> 08:45.460]  I like roots reggae that Iration was not doing it for me that night.
[08:46.460 --> 08:48.460]  So I left and I drove to the secret sesh.
[08:51.460 --> 08:53.460]  Shout out to my buddy Adam Mill for hosting the secret sesh.
[08:53.460 --> 08:55.460]  Adam Mill was in a really good mood.
[08:55.460 --> 08:56.460]  It was a really great time.
[08:56.460 --> 08:58.460]  I got to meet Adam's wife for the first time.
[08:58.460 --> 08:59.460]  I see her.
[08:59.460 --> 09:00.460]  She follows me on Facebook.
[09:00.460 --> 09:01.460]  We follow each other on all the social media.
[09:01.460 --> 09:03.460]  So it was cool to finally shake her hand and give her a hug.
[09:03.460 --> 09:04.460]  Shout out to Adam's wife.
[09:05.460 --> 09:07.460]  I bumped into Lindsay there.
[09:07.460 --> 09:08.460]  I ran into the damn granny.
[09:08.460 --> 09:09.460]  I saw Bobo Blaster Co there.
[09:09.460 --> 09:11.460]  I saw Brett for a brief moment.
[09:11.460 --> 09:12.460]  I saw the Grammy Gatsby.
[09:12.460 --> 09:13.460]  It was a great event.
[09:13.460 --> 09:18.460]  You guys, if you're ever able to go to a secret session, Denver, Colorado, make sure you get on the list.
[09:18.460 --> 09:19.460]  Make sure you go do it.
[09:19.460 --> 09:21.460]  Come take some dabs with Lindsay, myself, the damn granny.
[09:21.460 --> 09:23.460]  It's a good ass time.
[09:23.460 --> 09:25.460]  Shout out to Max for that big ass dab you gave me.
[09:25.460 --> 09:26.460]  It was delicious.
[09:26.460 --> 09:30.460]  Shout out to Max for every time that we see him and every time I see him.
[09:30.460 --> 09:32.460]  He is so, take this dab.
[09:32.460 --> 09:33.460]  Here's some bacon.
[09:33.460 --> 09:35.460]  Here's some something.
[09:35.460 --> 09:36.460]  I'm always like.
[09:36.460 --> 09:37.460]  Medicated bacon.
[09:37.460 --> 09:38.460]  He makes medicated bacon.
[09:38.460 --> 09:39.460]  Yes.
[09:39.460 --> 09:42.460]  And I do see people grubbing it at the event and they look satisfied, bro.
[09:42.460 --> 09:44.460]  He gives me some.
[09:44.460 --> 09:45.460]  Oh, go ahead.
[09:45.460 --> 09:46.460]  How would you medicate bacon?
[09:46.460 --> 09:47.460]  I mean.
[09:47.460 --> 09:50.460]  Well, I mean, I can't speak.
[09:50.460 --> 09:52.460]  I think his is in the crust.
[09:52.460 --> 09:54.460]  It's a sugar glaze, isn't it?
[09:54.460 --> 09:56.460]  I think, yeah, he puts like a cinnamon.
[09:56.460 --> 09:58.460]  I mean, I could be wrong on that, really.
[09:58.460 --> 09:59.460]  So don't quote me.
[09:59.460 --> 10:01.460]  I've never eaten it because I'm a vegetarian.
[10:01.460 --> 10:02.460]  I would love to eat it.
[10:02.460 --> 10:03.460]  Bacon.
[10:03.460 --> 10:04.460]  Yeah.
[10:04.460 --> 10:06.460]  I would assume you have to like, because I mean,
[10:06.460 --> 10:09.460]  cooking it in the oil wouldn't do enough because you wouldn't be able to
[10:09.460 --> 10:10.460]  tell the dosage.
[10:10.460 --> 10:13.460]  It's real crispy and it's coated in something because he handed me some
[10:13.460 --> 10:16.460]  and gave it to me, but I just gave it to Bobo Blaster Co.
[10:16.460 --> 10:18.460]  Because I don't eat bacon.
[10:18.460 --> 10:19.460]  When I told him that I'm a vegetarian,
[10:19.460 --> 10:23.460]  he kind of looked at me and he felt bad that he had been offering me bacon.
[10:23.460 --> 10:26.460]  He felt like legitimately guilty, like, fuck, I'm sorry, man.
[10:26.460 --> 10:27.460]  No.
[10:27.460 --> 10:28.460]  And I was like, no, it's cool, man.
[10:28.460 --> 10:30.460]  He goes, here, here, I got this, though.
[10:30.460 --> 10:33.460]  And he gave me a big ass dab, like a really, like a manly sized dab.
[10:33.460 --> 10:36.460]  And when I told him I took it all in one chunk, I'm good on that little one,
[10:36.460 --> 10:37.460]  but thank you.
[10:37.460 --> 10:38.460]  What did we just smoke?
[10:38.460 --> 10:43.460]  That was, hold on, let me think, space cream.
[10:43.460 --> 10:44.460]  Space cream.
[10:44.460 --> 10:47.460]  Okay, that had a good flavor, a good smooth burn, nice white ashes.
[10:47.460 --> 10:48.460]  I like that packaging.
[10:48.460 --> 10:50.460]  Can you tell me about that company and that packaging?
[10:50.460 --> 10:54.460]  This is from Altitude Organic Medicine in the Springs.
[10:54.460 --> 10:56.460]  Well, shout out to our friends at Altitude.
[10:56.460 --> 11:00.460]  This is pretty convenient for me.
[11:01.460 --> 11:04.460]  I'm kind of lazy when it gets to rolling joints sometimes.
[11:04.460 --> 11:07.460]  So this dude showed up with two packages of pre-rolled joints.
[11:07.460 --> 11:08.460]  The weed was good.
[11:08.460 --> 11:09.460]  Yeah, yeah, it tastes good.
[11:09.460 --> 11:11.460]  I got stoned from it.
[11:11.460 --> 11:14.460]  I'm a little leery about some places where I buy pre-rolls.
[11:14.460 --> 11:15.460]  You know what I mean?
[11:15.460 --> 11:16.460]  Oh, yeah.
[11:16.460 --> 11:21.460]  Because they're kind of suspect, but these guys, they come through every time.
[11:21.460 --> 11:22.460]  Yeah.
[11:22.460 --> 11:26.460]  One of their managers is a very good friend of mine, and I trust that place because of her.
[11:26.460 --> 11:29.460]  Because I know she wouldn't represent a place that wasn't worth representing.
[11:29.460 --> 11:30.460]  She's got too big of a heart.
[11:30.460 --> 11:31.460]  So shout out to Altitude.
[11:31.460 --> 11:32.460]  That's really cool.
[11:32.460 --> 11:33.460]  It's great packaging.
[11:33.460 --> 11:36.460]  This dude showed up with packages of pre-rolled joints of quality joints.
[11:36.460 --> 11:37.460]  Oh, yeah, for sure.
[11:37.460 --> 11:43.460]  You know, I don't know why a lot of more companies aren't pre-packaging.
[11:43.460 --> 11:45.460]  I like that it says Sativa and Indica on the top.
[11:45.460 --> 11:46.460]  That's rad.
[11:46.460 --> 11:47.460]  Cool.
[11:47.460 --> 11:48.460]  Great packaging.
[11:48.460 --> 11:49.460]  Good idea, you guys, over at Altitude.
[11:49.460 --> 11:50.460]  I like that.
[11:50.460 --> 11:52.460]  The first place I saw that was a place called Pride in Medicine in Denver,
[11:52.460 --> 11:54.460]  but they fell off when all the new rules came.
[11:54.460 --> 11:57.460]  Yeah, there's a couple of different places doing something similar,
[11:58.460 --> 12:00.460]  and I like the way that this project turned out.
[12:00.460 --> 12:01.460]  Those are slick.
[12:01.460 --> 12:03.460]  It's a good product, too.
[12:03.460 --> 12:10.460]  The Willie Nelson strand, I get a chance to try just about every product out there on the market,
[12:10.460 --> 12:12.460]  being able to travel the whole state.
[12:12.460 --> 12:13.460]  Oh, yeah.
[12:13.460 --> 12:18.460]  So I'm a sucker for name brand in marijuana.
[12:18.460 --> 12:24.460]  You know, I've tried the Snoop Dogg, but Willie, I got to give a shout out to him.
[12:25.460 --> 12:31.460]  His model, he actually grows his weed in-house, you know, unlike Snoop he just comes to.
[12:31.460 --> 12:32.460]  Right.
[12:32.460 --> 12:33.460]  He puts his name on something.
[12:33.460 --> 12:35.460]  He puts his name on the strand.
[12:35.460 --> 12:36.460]  He likes Willie.
[12:36.460 --> 12:38.460]  Actually, this is his company.
[12:38.460 --> 12:44.460]  He grew it, and I went to Lucy Sky in Denver, and they had a little room set up,
[12:44.460 --> 12:53.460]  had guitars, albums where he signed, all kinds of merch, and then his joint packaging.
[12:53.460 --> 12:55.460]  Is that a recreational or a medical place?
[12:55.460 --> 12:57.460]  It's both, rec and med.
[12:57.460 --> 13:00.460]  Okay, so anybody that's coming from out of state, make sure you check out, what's it called again?
[13:00.460 --> 13:02.460]  Willie's Reserve.
[13:02.460 --> 13:03.460]  The dispensary.
[13:03.460 --> 13:04.460]  Lucy Sky.
[13:04.460 --> 13:10.460]  Lucy Sky, and you can check out Willie's Reserve there, and there's a dispensary where they got some Willie Nelson memorabilia and merchandise.
[13:10.460 --> 13:11.460]  That's kind of cool.
[13:11.460 --> 13:12.460]  I'm going to have to go check that out myself.
[13:12.460 --> 13:19.460]  Yeah, I think all that's kind of for show, but the get is the bud.
[13:19.460 --> 13:23.460]  He's got concentrates and edibles, too.
[13:23.460 --> 13:24.460]  I haven't tried those.
[13:24.460 --> 13:27.460]  I just tried a couple of pre-rolled joints.
[13:27.460 --> 13:29.460]  I've just seen the packaging.
[13:29.460 --> 13:30.460]  The packaging looked intense.
[13:30.460 --> 13:32.460]  Yeah, it is pretty intense.
[13:32.460 --> 13:34.460]  All the new packaging is intense.
[13:34.460 --> 13:39.460]  It's a tube, and then you pull it out, and then it's got another pre-rolled tube in there.
[13:39.460 --> 13:42.460]  It's like a Russian doll trying to buy cannabis now.
[13:42.460 --> 13:43.460]  Exactly.
[13:43.460 --> 13:44.460]  Yep.
[13:44.460 --> 13:45.460]  Exactly.
[13:45.460 --> 13:46.460]  I don't have a …
[13:46.460 --> 13:47.460]  That's all right.
[13:47.460 --> 13:48.460]  Lindsey, what did you just bust out?
[13:48.460 --> 13:50.460]  You just threw some snacks here on the table.
[13:50.460 --> 13:51.460]  What do you got for us?
[13:51.460 --> 13:55.460]  Oh, this is the Incredibles monkey bar.
[13:55.460 --> 13:56.460]  Oh, shit.
[13:56.460 --> 13:58.460]  The medical dose.
[13:58.460 --> 13:59.460]  The medical dose.
[13:59.460 --> 14:01.460]  So, each square is 20 milligrams.
[14:01.460 --> 14:03.460]  I'm going to move these right out of my reach.
[14:03.460 --> 14:05.460]  I appreciate you.
[14:05.460 --> 14:09.460]  I love you more than Terps, but I haven't eaten edibles since my experience at the Secret Sesh.
[14:09.460 --> 14:10.460]  I know.
[14:10.460 --> 14:11.460]  I keep trying.
[14:11.460 --> 14:12.460]  I know.
[14:12.460 --> 14:13.460]  I know, and I'm kind of trying.
[14:13.460 --> 14:14.460]  I'm trying to see how long I can go.
[14:14.460 --> 14:15.460]  I bring you a lower dosage every time.
[14:15.460 --> 14:16.460]  I know.
[14:17.460 --> 14:20.460]  Once I get on a streak, I'm really weird, and I like to stay on a streak.
[14:20.460 --> 14:21.460]  I don't know.
[14:21.460 --> 14:22.460]  I'm on a streak.
[14:22.460 --> 14:23.460]  I got five milligrams in the car if you want it.
[14:23.460 --> 14:25.460]  A streak and no edibles whatsoever?
[14:25.460 --> 14:26.460]  A streak of … Yeah.
[14:26.460 --> 14:28.460]  Well, whenever I pick a streak, whatever I'm doing, I'm really stubborn.
[14:28.460 --> 14:31.460]  So, if I commit to something, then I just like … Once I've made it like a week or
[14:31.460 --> 14:34.460]  two, and I've broken the desire or whatever, then I'm like, it's easy.
[14:34.460 --> 14:38.460]  Let's just see how long I can go on whatever I'm doing here, whether it's not eating
[14:38.460 --> 14:41.460]  meat, which has been 20-something years now, or not brushing my hair, which has been almost
[14:41.460 --> 14:43.460]  12 years, or just shit like that.
[14:43.460 --> 14:46.460]  What do you miss more, brushing your hair or eating meat?
[14:46.460 --> 14:47.460]  I don't miss either one of those.
[14:47.460 --> 14:48.460]  Oh, okay.
[14:48.460 --> 14:49.460]  I don't miss either one of those.
[14:49.460 --> 14:50.460]  Brushing your hair is a waste of time.
[14:50.460 --> 14:51.460]  I miss brushing my hair, too.
[14:51.460 --> 14:52.460]  Yeah.
[14:52.460 --> 14:53.460]  He's a bald guy.
[14:53.460 --> 14:54.460]  He's got his head shaved nice and close here.
[14:54.460 --> 14:55.460]  You could almost brush your beard.
[14:55.460 --> 14:56.460]  Yeah, and my back hair.
[14:56.460 --> 14:57.460]  Oh, shit.
[14:57.460 --> 14:58.460]  That was awesome.
[14:58.460 --> 14:59.460]  I like this guy.
[14:59.460 --> 15:00.460]  You're going to be on the show more often.
[15:00.460 --> 15:01.460]  I know.
[15:01.460 --> 15:02.460]  Just to make your no-edible streak fun, I even showed up with edibles this time.
[15:02.460 --> 15:03.460]  I've got a bunch of high-end chocolates that we just got into the shop that I just got
[15:03.460 --> 15:04.460]  into the shop.
[15:04.460 --> 15:05.460]  I'm like, I'm going to get you one.
[15:05.460 --> 15:06.460]  I'm going to get you one.
[15:07.460 --> 15:10.460]  They come in a sample pack, so I brought the sample for us to play with.
[15:10.460 --> 15:11.460]  The person that got me those Reggae on the Rocks tickets, that might be her favorite
[15:11.460 --> 15:12.460]  edible that you brought there, the tiramisu one.
[15:12.460 --> 15:13.460]  I had a bunch of people ask me for it, and that's the one I plan on trying.
[15:13.460 --> 15:14.460]  You know how I act for Lemon G dabs?
[15:14.460 --> 15:15.460]  That's how she gets for those tiramisu edibles.
[15:15.460 --> 15:16.460]  The packaging is impressive as shit.
[15:16.460 --> 15:17.460]  They're so good.
[15:17.460 --> 15:18.460]  I love it.
[15:18.460 --> 15:19.460]  I love it.
[15:19.460 --> 15:20.460]  I love it.
[15:20.460 --> 15:21.460]  I love it.
[15:21.460 --> 15:22.460]  I love it.
[15:22.460 --> 15:23.460]  I love it.
[15:23.460 --> 15:24.460]  I love it.
[15:24.460 --> 15:25.460]  I love it.
[15:25.460 --> 15:26.460]  I love it.
[15:26.460 --> 15:27.460]  I love it.
[15:27.460 --> 15:28.460]  I love it.
[15:28.460 --> 15:29.460]  I love it.
[15:29.460 --> 15:30.460]  I love it.
[15:30.460 --> 15:31.460]  I love it.
[15:31.460 --> 15:32.460]  I love it.
[15:32.460 --> 15:33.460]  I love it.
[15:34.460 --> 15:36.460]  The packaging is impressive as shit.
[15:36.460 --> 15:38.460]  They're totally compliant with the new rules too, which I like.
[15:38.460 --> 15:43.460]  There's a lot of stuff that I'm getting samples of right now, isn't there?
[15:43.460 --> 15:44.460]  Packaging.
[15:44.460 --> 15:48.460]  Yeah, I think when they rolled out, I think they knew that that was coming.
[15:48.460 --> 15:51.460]  They just planned for it to get.
[15:51.460 --> 15:52.460]  Yeah.
[15:52.460 --> 15:56.460]  I mean, I haven't tried one yet, but so far, packaging and presentation is a home run.
[15:56.460 --> 16:00.460]  Remember back in the day when we had a dispensary and the packaging was basically one of these
[16:00.460 --> 16:02.460]  Ziploc bags with the product name handwritten on it?
[16:02.460 --> 16:04.460]  Not basically, literally.
[16:04.460 --> 16:08.460]  There's a few places still that sell weed in baggies.
[16:08.460 --> 16:10.460]  Oh, that's funny.
[16:10.460 --> 16:11.460]  Yeah.
[16:11.460 --> 16:17.460]  We would get the owner's, one of the owners would walk in with a laundry or not, you know,
[16:17.460 --> 16:21.460]  like the sweater storage bin, the big plastic bin for like under the bed.
[16:21.460 --> 16:23.460]  It was one of those Tupperware things.
[16:23.460 --> 16:25.460]  You mean the thing that a lot of people make a Yeezy cloner out of?
[16:25.460 --> 16:27.460]  Yeah, that thing.
[16:28.460 --> 16:33.460]  And it would be full of like slices of banana bread individually wrapped in Ziploc bags
[16:33.460 --> 16:37.460]  with just a piece of scotch tape, taping the flap down so it fit taut.
[16:37.460 --> 16:40.460]  And that was what went onto our shelf.
[16:40.460 --> 16:43.460]  Like, yeah, it was exactly that.
[16:43.460 --> 16:45.460]  And you know where they stayed when we closed at the end of the night?
[16:45.460 --> 16:46.460]  Right there.
[16:46.460 --> 16:47.460]  Right there on that shelf.
[16:47.460 --> 16:48.460]  Nothing got put away.
[16:48.460 --> 16:50.460]  They were never there longer than like three or four.
[16:50.460 --> 16:55.460]  Like part of me is glad like we've advanced to where we are now because it's a good thing
[16:55.460 --> 16:58.460]  that the health department is overseeing edible production.
[16:58.460 --> 17:04.460]  But I never pictured something like the product I'm holding in my hand.
[17:04.460 --> 17:08.460]  I mean, even three years ago, let alone five or seven.
[17:08.460 --> 17:14.460]  That's like something that you would get from a really fine chocolate company through the mail or something.
[17:14.460 --> 17:15.460]  Like I figure if you...
[17:15.460 --> 17:21.460]  I've heard a rumor about the company that they got some exotic French chef, but that, you know,
[17:22.460 --> 17:26.460]  that's probably just somebody making it up, but who knows?
[17:26.460 --> 17:27.460]  Maybe.
[17:27.460 --> 17:30.460]  They've definitely got a high-end chocolatier working for them.
[17:30.460 --> 17:33.460]  These are impressive as shit.
[17:33.460 --> 17:37.460]  I've paid a lot of money to give these to girlfriends throughout my life.
[17:37.460 --> 17:40.460]  It's just non-medicated.
[17:40.460 --> 17:45.460]  I've paid the same amount for these that I paid for unmedicated chocolates more than one holiday.
[17:45.460 --> 17:47.460]  So since we're hyping them up, let's give them a quick shout out.
[17:47.460 --> 17:51.460]  They didn't pay for any advertising, but they seem to be the talk of the show for a couple of seconds here.
[17:51.460 --> 17:53.460]  Coda Signature Truffles.
[17:53.460 --> 17:55.460]  Coda Signature Truffles.
[17:55.460 --> 17:56.460]  They're packaged very nicely.
[17:56.460 --> 17:57.460]  They come in a black box.
[17:57.460 --> 17:58.460]  It looks like a condom package.
[17:58.460 --> 18:00.460]  You get three different flits.
[18:00.460 --> 18:01.460]  Doesn't it?
[18:01.460 --> 18:03.460]  It looks like a fancy condom box is what it makes me think of.
[18:03.460 --> 18:06.460]  I've had more than one person describe it as that.
[18:06.460 --> 18:07.460]  It's the logo.
[18:07.460 --> 18:08.460]  It's not the box.
[18:08.460 --> 18:09.460]  It's the logo.
[18:09.460 --> 18:13.460]  The logo is kind of rubberish.
[18:14.460 --> 18:16.460]  It makes a circle.
[18:16.460 --> 18:17.460]  Yeah, absolutely.
[18:17.460 --> 18:18.460]  It does.
[18:18.460 --> 18:20.460]  I'm not going to get into it.
[18:20.460 --> 18:25.460]  I had heard about these long before I actually got to see them in person.
[18:25.460 --> 18:28.460]  When they were at the shop today, I had to grab a couple.
[18:28.460 --> 18:29.460]  Oh, yeah, for sure.
[18:29.460 --> 18:36.460]  They are, as far as edibles, I think they're the tastiest.
[18:36.460 --> 18:38.460]  Probably one I've tried on the market anyway.
[18:38.460 --> 18:39.460]  I haven't tried them out.
[18:40.460 --> 18:42.460]  Lindsay just threw a medium-sized dab at me.
[18:42.460 --> 18:43.460]  I'm going to have to take this one.
[18:43.460 --> 18:44.460]  So, uh,
[18:44.460 --> 18:46.460]  If the show slows down for a second,
[18:46.460 --> 18:48.460]  just know that we're getting higher for your entertainment.
[18:48.460 --> 18:50.460]  There are six pieces in that package.
[18:50.460 --> 18:52.460]  Do you guys dive in if you want one?
[18:52.460 --> 18:54.460]  The flavors are kind of listed on the box here.
[18:54.460 --> 18:56.460]  There are six of them in there.
[18:56.460 --> 18:59.460]  How many milligrams is each piece?
[18:59.460 --> 19:00.460]  Each piece is 10 milligrams.
[19:00.460 --> 19:02.460]  You get six per box, so it's only 60.
[19:02.460 --> 19:05.460]  So you guys can really dive in and try a couple.
[19:05.460 --> 19:06.460]  So you did 10 of them?
[19:06.460 --> 19:07.460]  No, no.
[19:07.460 --> 19:08.460]  I brought you the baby step.
[19:08.460 --> 19:10.460]  I mean, the starter step, bro.
[19:10.460 --> 19:11.460]  Keeping my streak.
[19:11.460 --> 19:13.460]  I'm just going to infuse your lunch one day.
[19:13.460 --> 19:14.460]  I'm freaking out.
[19:14.460 --> 19:15.460]  I'm keeping my streak.
[19:15.460 --> 19:18.460]  Keep thinking that until I infuse your lunch one day.
[19:18.460 --> 19:21.460]  You're going to infuse it with some acid or some THC.
[19:21.460 --> 19:24.460]  How much does that package cost if you're not an employee at the dispensary?
[19:24.460 --> 19:25.460]  I honestly don't know.
[19:25.460 --> 19:27.460]  What a snobby asshole are you?
[19:27.460 --> 19:29.460]  You're a surprise I haven't learned yet.
[19:29.460 --> 19:30.460]  You caught me on the spot.
[19:30.460 --> 19:32.460]  It's like the one item on my shelf I don't know.
[19:32.460 --> 19:34.460]  There's that and one paper pad.
[19:34.460 --> 19:35.460]  Oh, yeah, sure.
[19:35.460 --> 19:36.460]  One.
[19:36.460 --> 19:37.460]  I'm just kidding, right?
[19:37.460 --> 19:38.460]  I'm just saying that you don't know.
[19:38.460 --> 19:39.460]  Quiz me, Dex.
[19:39.460 --> 19:40.460]  Do you have a price range?
[19:40.460 --> 19:41.460]  I'm chewing right now.
[19:41.460 --> 19:42.460]  This is delicious.
[19:42.460 --> 19:43.460]  Do you have a price range?
[19:43.460 --> 19:44.460]  It's about 23.
[19:44.460 --> 19:45.460]  Okay, worth it.
[19:45.460 --> 19:46.460]  Worth it, then.
[19:46.460 --> 19:47.460]  That's probably worth 23 bucks.
[19:47.460 --> 19:48.460]  A hundred percent worth it.
[19:48.460 --> 19:49.460]  Yeah.
[19:49.460 --> 19:50.460]  If you were a dude and you were in trouble and your girlfriend's a pothead
[19:50.460 --> 19:52.460]  and you brought those home to your girlfriend, you'd probably be fixed.
[19:52.460 --> 19:56.460]  She might think you've done something wrong.
[19:56.460 --> 19:58.460]  You brought her something fancy like that.
[19:58.460 --> 20:00.460]  Yeah, that's why you got to save it until you're already done fucked up.
[20:00.460 --> 20:02.460]  Just wait until she already knows when you're in the dog house already
[20:02.460 --> 20:03.460]  and then show up with those.
[20:03.460 --> 20:05.460]  Yeah, if you're not a regular gift bringer, this is a,
[20:05.460 --> 20:07.460]  I screwed up good, don't call my mama.
[20:07.460 --> 20:08.460]  Calm down.
[20:08.460 --> 20:11.460]  Did your wife call your mom when you fuck up?
[20:11.460 --> 20:12.460]  No, but like-
[20:12.460 --> 20:15.460]  Jeff was really concerned for you.
[20:15.460 --> 20:17.460]  Before I left the house my mom called my wife,
[20:17.460 --> 20:20.460]  which it's weird that we're talking about that now on the show,
[20:20.460 --> 20:22.460]  but these are delicious.
[20:22.460 --> 20:24.460]  Back to the fucking topic of handling.
[20:24.460 --> 20:26.460]  Wait, to switch, just so you know, girls do do that.
[20:26.460 --> 20:29.460]  They call their significant other's mother.
[20:29.460 --> 20:34.460]  I mean, like in 30s and 40s to tattle and get them in trouble.
[20:34.460 --> 20:35.460]  Just so you know.
[20:35.460 --> 20:37.460]  My mom would just laugh and hang up on you.
[20:37.460 --> 20:39.460]  I know, I know, click.
[20:39.460 --> 20:42.460]  Tell me about it, click.
[20:42.460 --> 20:45.460]  Sorry, mama.
[20:45.460 --> 20:46.460]  All right.
[20:46.460 --> 20:48.460]  So you guys, we did come together for an actual podcast.
[20:48.460 --> 20:51.460]  We're not going to talk about dabs and chocolates and all that shit for this whole show.
[20:51.460 --> 20:52.460]  Yeah, that was a random promo.
[20:52.460 --> 20:54.460]  We just brought fun snacks and got kind of carried away.
[20:54.460 --> 20:57.460]  Pretty much Mike called me semi-early today.
[20:57.460 --> 20:58.460]  For Mike and I it might have been early.
[20:58.460 --> 21:01.460]  For most of you folks it was probably well into your day.
[21:02.460 --> 21:07.460]  I was just thinking to myself, I bet you this conversation happened at 1 and this new and I.
[21:07.460 --> 21:09.460]  It still had an AM attached to it.
[21:09.460 --> 21:10.460]  Yeah, there was an AM involved.
[21:10.460 --> 21:12.460]  But Mike sent me a message.
[21:12.460 --> 21:13.460]  11.59.
[21:13.460 --> 21:15.460]  And he's like, hey, this is what's up.
[21:15.460 --> 21:19.460]  This reporter is looking for somebody to talk to because there's this new story going on.
[21:19.460 --> 21:21.460]  And he's like, would you like to speak?
[21:21.460 --> 21:22.460]  And I was like, nope.
[21:22.460 --> 21:26.460]  And about two seconds later my phone blew up with a whole bunch of other people asking me,
[21:26.460 --> 21:28.460]  would you like to speak for us, would you like to speak for us?
[21:28.460 --> 21:32.460]  Well spoken, I guess I'm well known amongst the cannabis community and they felt that I'd be a good representative.
[21:32.460 --> 21:35.460]  So shout out to all the people that messaged me and wanted me to contact this reporter for you.
[21:35.460 --> 21:36.460]  That's cool.
[21:36.460 --> 21:43.460]  I passed the baton over to our buddy Mike because I don't want to be on the news talking about that I grow cannabis.
[21:43.460 --> 21:44.460]  I just don't want to do that.
[21:44.460 --> 21:45.460]  So I let Mike do it.
[21:45.460 --> 21:47.460]  And Mike's well spoken and eloquent.
[21:47.460 --> 21:51.460]  There's a reason caregivers don't do interviews.
[21:51.460 --> 21:52.460]  Yeah.
[21:52.460 --> 21:53.460]  It's a really good reason.
[21:53.460 --> 21:55.460]  The Barkowitz effect?
[21:55.460 --> 21:56.460]  I didn't want to name it on the show.
[21:57.460 --> 21:59.460]  It's legitimately the Barkowitz effect.
[21:59.460 --> 22:04.460]  The one and only caregiver in Colorado to really do an interview paid for it severely.
[22:04.460 --> 22:08.460]  Yeah, is still paying for it in many very real ways.
[22:08.460 --> 22:10.460]  And it's been a lot of years.
[22:10.460 --> 22:16.460]  In Pueblo that means that we had no caregiver advocates down here.
[22:16.460 --> 22:22.460]  Sort of for lack of a better candidate that became me a long time ago.
[22:22.460 --> 22:23.460]  Thank you.
[22:23.460 --> 22:24.460]  You're welcome.
[22:24.460 --> 22:26.460]  I think it's a fight that I care about.
[22:26.460 --> 22:30.460]  Caregivers have been part of Colorado for more than a decade.
[22:30.460 --> 22:33.460]  We've never been part of the problem.
[22:33.460 --> 22:36.460]  And I say we in a very general term because I am not a caregiver.
[22:36.460 --> 22:43.460]  But they're very much under attack again right now in Colorado from a number of different angles.
[22:43.460 --> 22:46.460]  They're going after the doctors right now and looking at plant counts.
[22:46.460 --> 22:50.460]  Every county is restricting the number of plants you can grow in a home.
[22:50.460 --> 22:58.460]  Or looking to limit the size and scope of your garden in one way or another if it's not by plant count directly.
[22:58.460 --> 23:00.460]  It's a rough time.
[23:00.460 --> 23:04.460]  I predicted a couple years back that caregiving wouldn't be a thing by 2020.
[23:04.460 --> 23:07.460]  But we saw this happen in Springs less than a year ago.
[23:07.460 --> 23:12.460]  And now that's basically the same rules they're trying to implement that they did implement in Springs or trying to do here.
[23:12.460 --> 23:14.460]  It's even more than that.
[23:14.460 --> 23:15.460]  They've already done it here.
[23:16.460 --> 23:27.460]  And what's going on right now is our Board of County Commissioners is talking about putting a question on the vote this November on the ballot that says,
[23:27.460 --> 23:35.460]  should we go to the state and continue to lobby for a statewide cap of 18 plants per household?
[23:37.460 --> 23:44.460]  So even if you have a medical recommendation from your doctor to grow an increased plant count of, say, 60 plants?
[23:45.460 --> 23:47.460]  Then fuck your medical card.
[23:47.460 --> 23:48.460]  Fuck your needs.
[23:48.460 --> 23:49.460]  Fuck your condition.
[23:49.460 --> 23:51.460]  You're limited by this new rule.
[23:51.460 --> 23:56.460]  The new rules that they're talking about wouldn't affect the card that you get written.
[23:56.460 --> 23:59.460]  It would just affect your ability to grow on that card.
[23:59.460 --> 24:09.460]  You'd be limited to that number of plants unless you had a specific type of property, which I haven't seen defined anywhere.
[24:09.460 --> 24:11.460]  It's just not in a house or a residence.
[24:11.460 --> 24:19.460]  And because of what caregivers are and what the other rules around caregiving are in Colorado, that means you can't be a caregiver and have more than 18 plants, period.
[24:19.460 --> 24:24.460]  Because if you're a caregiver, you can't have a storefront or a building or anything like that.
[24:24.460 --> 24:25.460]  You have to do it out of your home.
[24:25.460 --> 24:30.460]  So essentially, these new rules statewide means no more caregivers.
[24:30.460 --> 24:37.460]  And your extended plant count card could still exist, and you'd just be assigning that extended plant count to your dispensary.
[24:38.460 --> 24:41.460]  Which feels like is what they're trying to do with most of the patients.
[24:41.460 --> 24:48.460]  They're trying to take away the caregiver and send it all to a dispensary so they can make some tax money off of it and not worry about what's actually needing to be taken care of.
[24:48.460 --> 24:51.460]  That's been the goal statewide for a long time.
[24:51.460 --> 24:59.460]  Caregivers have been the scapegoat for all continued black market activity in Colorado for the last eight years.
[24:59.460 --> 25:05.460]  Anytime a homegrown gets busted, they're like, oh, my God, these medical rules are so confusing.
[25:05.460 --> 25:10.460]  And I go back and reread the article in the paper, and there was no paperwork.
[25:10.460 --> 25:17.460]  It wasn't a caregiver that was breaking the rules or manipulating the rules or hiding under the rules.
[25:17.460 --> 25:22.460]  It was just a black market grower that's been here for forever doing what they've always done.
[25:22.460 --> 25:27.460]  The only thing that's different is that caregivers also exist in the same state.
[25:27.460 --> 25:33.460]  But caregivers are the public face of homegrowing, and so they take all that heat.
[25:34.460 --> 25:48.460]  At the same time, the state has gotten a taste of recreational taxes, and they've gotten a real look at the sales totals by volume, and the med market's still eating up half of what Colorado, period, is selling.
[25:48.460 --> 25:53.460]  And they would love to tax that at the higher rate.
[25:53.460 --> 26:01.460]  So medical's kind of under attack under all fronts right now, which is why I've been telling people to register to vote for eight months.
[26:02.460 --> 26:11.460]  Something that you can clear up for a lot of Colorado folks, people in Colorado have this thing that they think that since as an adult, they're allowed to grow six plants.
[26:11.460 --> 26:18.460]  If they get their basic six plant medical marijuana card, are you allowed to grow your six plus your six, or are you just limited at the original six?
[26:18.460 --> 26:20.460]  It depends on where you're living.
[26:20.460 --> 26:22.460]  That is confusing as shit.
[26:22.460 --> 26:24.460]  It really, really, really, really is.
[26:24.460 --> 26:26.460]  Okay, so here in Pueblo?
[26:26.460 --> 26:28.460]  It matters city to county.
[26:29.460 --> 26:32.460]  The city doesn't care what your plant count is.
[26:32.460 --> 26:41.460]  I worked incredibly hard for a very long time to make sure that the city of Pueblo did not implement a plant count limit.
[26:42.460 --> 26:58.460]  We found sympathetic ears inside city government, and myself and a caregiver here in town who isn't willing to go on the news but is willing to work with city government people managed to get them to hear reason and not do a plant count limit.
[26:58.460 --> 27:02.460]  So they did a square footage limit and require air filtration.
[27:03.460 --> 27:09.460]  We couldn't get them to hear reason on a number of other rules they implemented that I don't support nearly as much.
[27:09.460 --> 27:21.460]  But in the county, they've already passed an 18 plant count limit, which means if you live in Pueblo County versus city, you're limited 18 plants period.
[27:22.460 --> 27:37.460]  If you live in a residential area, there are some exceptions to that and you'll have to look up your specific zoning, your residence, and then what the specific rules are for that zoning designation before I can give you a hard answer on that.
[27:37.460 --> 27:39.460]  So yeah, it's very complicated.
[27:39.460 --> 27:49.460]  You answered my question because somebody came into the dispensary the other day and told me that Pueblo was an 18 count county and I was like, what are you talking about?
[27:50.460 --> 27:51.460]  I was like, no, it's not.
[27:51.460 --> 27:53.460]  And he was like, yeah, it is.
[27:53.460 --> 27:54.460]  He's like, look it up.
[27:54.460 --> 27:55.460]  And I was like, I'm not going to look it up.
[27:55.460 --> 27:56.460]  I'm going to call Mike.
[27:59.460 --> 28:04.460]  I remember that fight and there was not much public support against it.
[28:06.460 --> 28:07.460]  Caregivers are really busy people.
[28:07.460 --> 28:18.460]  The state put the squeeze on them several years ago with a couple of statewide limitations that mean in practice, caregivers don't have a lot of free time to lobby city councils.
[28:20.460 --> 28:26.460]  And when they do, they tend to get treated pretty badly because they're there for one specific issue.
[28:26.460 --> 28:31.460]  They don't have six months to learn how to play the insane game you're required to play to do things like that.
[28:33.460 --> 28:37.460]  It's often unfortunate that the system works that way, but that's how it works.
[28:39.460 --> 28:48.460]  And so caregivers have had a rough go of it in Colorado and it looks like one, maybe two more elections and they're going to be something that's in our history books.
[28:49.460 --> 28:50.460]  We need caregivers.
[28:50.460 --> 28:58.460]  So if you can really do, if you're a part of the vote, make sure that you wait for this to come up on the ballot and you do not allow them to limit our plant count to 18 plants.
[28:59.460 --> 29:05.460]  Just as an example, if you've got a four by four tray and you've got one light, it is very feasible.
[29:05.460 --> 29:09.460]  It makes a lot of sense to run 64 plants in that four by four tray.
[29:09.460 --> 29:11.460]  That sounds like a lot of plants, right?
[29:11.460 --> 29:12.460]  But here's how you do it.
[29:12.460 --> 29:13.460]  You cut 64 clones.
[29:13.460 --> 29:16.460]  As soon as they start popping fat roots, you put them in the four by four tray.
[29:16.460 --> 29:19.460]  You put a little capillary mat down for those roots to grow into.
[29:19.460 --> 29:22.460]  You do, it's like an ebb and flow system.
[29:22.460 --> 29:24.460]  You fill that tray, then you drain that tray every hour.
[29:24.460 --> 29:26.460]  Fill it, drain it, fill it, drain it.
[29:26.460 --> 29:27.460]  You got 64 little plants in there.
[29:27.460 --> 29:29.460]  You flower them in there about six inches tall.
[29:29.460 --> 29:33.460]  They finish off about 12 inches tall and you pull about six or seven grams per plant.
[29:33.460 --> 29:36.460]  That's a pound of weed, but you got 64 plants.
[29:36.460 --> 29:40.460]  You do the same thing with one plant or four plants under a seven gallon pot, just depending on how long you want to veg it.
[29:40.460 --> 29:42.460]  It takes a lot longer.
[29:42.460 --> 29:48.460]  It's way easier to pull that pound of cannabis from Mike's Medicine with 64 tiny, tiny plants
[29:48.460 --> 29:52.460]  than it is with a whole bunch of big pots and bigger plants that you have to veg for a longer time.
[29:52.460 --> 29:53.460]  So it makes a lot of sense.
[29:53.460 --> 29:57.460]  It's not like 64 plants is not like cartel numbers kicking out a whole bunch of weight.
[29:57.460 --> 29:58.460]  That's one pound.
[29:58.460 --> 30:00.460]  Just one example.
[30:00.460 --> 30:04.460]  I mean, people, when they see something like 99 plants is the state limit,
[30:04.460 --> 30:10.460]  they picture the plants they've seen in the newspaper that are the size of a Volkswagen bus.
[30:10.460 --> 30:13.460]  They picture 99 of those suckers.
[30:13.460 --> 30:20.460]  And they just don't realize that immediately the number's cut in half because only half of those plants can be flowering.
[30:20.460 --> 30:25.460]  When you're talking about a caregiver that's growing 99 plants,
[30:25.460 --> 30:34.460]  it's often because they're caregivers for five patients, often five patients and then themselves.
[30:34.460 --> 30:38.460]  And each patient requires two or three strains.
[30:38.460 --> 30:41.460]  Each strain requires one or two moms.
[30:41.460 --> 30:45.460]  When you start dividing out over life cycles in two different rooms,
[30:45.460 --> 30:53.460]  all of a sudden you're struggling to stay under 99 and you're barely producing enough marijuana for just your patients.
[30:53.460 --> 30:57.460]  And if you want to run a seed pack to find something new, then you're really already over numbers.
[30:57.460 --> 30:59.460]  As soon as you pop those 10 and get them planted.
[30:59.460 --> 31:01.460]  I mean, it gets very complicated.
[31:01.460 --> 31:06.460]  And when your number's six, it's almost impossible.
[31:06.460 --> 31:10.460]  You're basically left with plant a seed, pray it's female.
[31:10.460 --> 31:14.460]  Maybe keep one and rotate five.
[31:14.460 --> 31:19.460]  I mean, it gets very complicated quickly and it's not productive.
[31:19.460 --> 31:27.460]  And it doesn't do anything to combat the things that people that are writing these rules are hoping it will.
[31:27.460 --> 31:30.460]  It's not going to do anything to the illegal growers.
[31:30.460 --> 31:36.460]  It's not going to do anything to the smell of marijuana in neighborhoods from shitty gross with no carbon filters.
[31:36.460 --> 31:43.460]  It's just going to make life a lot harder for patients who rely on caregivers for medicine at a price they can afford.
[31:43.460 --> 31:45.460]  It's going to force them to go to a dispensary.
[31:45.460 --> 31:48.460]  It's going to force them to maybe find a ride.
[31:48.460 --> 31:49.460]  They don't have a ride.
[31:49.460 --> 31:50.460]  Maybe they don't have time.
[31:50.460 --> 31:51.460]  Maybe they don't have money.
[31:52.460 --> 32:02.460]  Because I know that if you've got a caregiver, what you are reimbursing your caregiver compared to what you are paying at the dispensary is a huge, huge, drastic difference.
[32:02.460 --> 32:05.460]  The difference is massive.
[32:05.460 --> 32:06.460]  Almost 50%.
[32:06.460 --> 32:07.460]  Yeah.
[32:07.460 --> 32:12.460]  I mean, just the cost to the patient is 50%, at least.
[32:12.460 --> 32:14.460]  So here's something that we should think about.
[32:14.460 --> 32:16.460]  Mike, I've been your caregiver for how long now?
[32:16.460 --> 32:18.460]  Since probably 2010-ish.
[32:18.460 --> 32:19.460]  Give or take.
[32:19.460 --> 32:20.460]  So six or seven years.
[32:21.460 --> 32:24.460]  I know your cannabis needs very well, I like to think.
[32:24.460 --> 32:27.460]  I've watched you evolve into a little dabber lately.
[32:27.460 --> 32:28.460]  It's been kind of neat to see.
[32:28.460 --> 32:30.460]  It's a time saver.
[32:30.460 --> 32:31.460]  I can name strains.
[32:31.460 --> 32:32.460]  I know which strains you like.
[32:32.460 --> 32:37.460]  I know if I walked into my garden, I'd be like, I've got to throw a couple of these into the room for Mike because he's going to need this in about 60 days.
[32:37.460 --> 32:39.460]  I've got to get this ready for him.
[32:39.460 --> 32:40.460]  Yep.
[32:40.460 --> 32:41.460]  Lindsey's a bud tender.
[32:41.460 --> 32:42.460]  She's a very good bud tender.
[32:42.460 --> 32:44.460]  She knows you.
[32:44.460 --> 32:48.460]  But how much do you know about Mike's cannabis needs right now?
[32:49.460 --> 32:50.460]  Yeah.
[32:50.460 --> 32:52.460]  But there's nothing wrong with that.
[32:52.460 --> 32:53.460]  That's not your job.
[32:53.460 --> 32:55.460]  That's not your responsibility.
[32:55.460 --> 32:57.460]  In my defense, Mike's never come in the shop before.
[32:57.460 --> 33:00.460]  Mike and I have dabbed at the same time.
[33:00.460 --> 33:04.460]  I'm assuming actually that you need Indica's and CBD's.
[33:04.460 --> 33:07.460]  A variety, but CBD, yes.
[33:07.460 --> 33:09.460]  Is Kush Tonic one of your strains?
[33:09.460 --> 33:11.460]  Kush Tonic's one of my favorite Green and Healthy strains.
[33:11.460 --> 33:12.460]  Killing it.
[33:12.460 --> 33:14.460]  Yeah, don't know what.
[33:14.460 --> 33:16.460]  Just kidding, sorry.
[33:17.460 --> 33:21.460]  But if I mess with it in the daytime, I'm not going to get a thing done.
[33:21.460 --> 33:22.460]  For sure.
[33:22.460 --> 33:25.460]  But that's exactly what I need it to do for me in the evenings.
[33:25.460 --> 33:27.460]  But we're wandering.
[33:27.460 --> 33:29.460]  Caregivers are important, damn it.
[33:29.460 --> 33:30.460]  Yeah, yeah.
[33:30.460 --> 33:32.460]  But my point is that I know what Mike needs.
[33:32.460 --> 33:34.460]  I know I have a schedule.
[33:34.460 --> 33:37.460]  I've got flowers pretty much prepared when Mike needs them.
[33:37.460 --> 33:41.460]  I know, like, oh, shit, I better put that into flower soon because Mike got this from me a little bit ago.
[33:41.460 --> 33:42.460]  He got this.
[33:42.460 --> 33:44.460]  That means pretty soon his jar is going to be empty.
[33:44.460 --> 33:46.460]  He's going to be like, where's my grateful dog, bro?
[33:46.460 --> 33:48.460]  And I'm going to need to have some of that ready for him.
[33:48.460 --> 33:50.460]  And no offense to you, you're not supposed to know that.
[33:50.460 --> 33:51.460]  But you don't know that shit.
[33:51.460 --> 33:55.460]  You're going to be the one providing his cannabis if they eliminate me from the chain.
[33:55.460 --> 33:59.460]  And you're going to have to learn all of these people that do not have a caregiver anymore.
[33:59.460 --> 34:00.460]  You're going to have to try to learn their medicine.
[34:00.460 --> 34:03.460]  You're going to have to try to have that product on the shelf.
[34:03.460 --> 34:07.460]  Can the Grow It Green and Healthy Wellness supply those flowers that Mike needs,
[34:07.460 --> 34:10.460]  the juicy needs, that I need, that you need, that the people in that room need,
[34:10.460 --> 34:12.460]  the people in that house over there need?
[34:12.460 --> 34:15.460]  Can the Grow It Green supply those specific flowers like a caregiver can?
[34:15.460 --> 34:19.460]  No, because they don't have that many mother plants and they don't have the time.
[34:19.460 --> 34:24.460]  The part of the equation that really worries me isn't really the part that affects me directly.
[34:24.460 --> 34:36.460]  A lot of the people that use the caregiver system in Colorado are consuming massive amounts of THC-concentrated oil and CBD-concentrated oil.
[34:36.460 --> 34:41.460]  And in the medical or the rec market, this is going to cost them hundreds of dollars a day per dose.
[34:41.460 --> 34:50.460]  When you price it out recreational, several hundred dollars a day per dose, two doses a day.
[34:50.460 --> 34:56.460]  So you're looking at $1,200, $1,300 per day in medication.
[34:56.460 --> 35:01.460]  And in the caregiver market, with the plant counts that are under attack right now,
[35:01.460 --> 35:14.460]  they're getting that same dose at the same quality, if not better, depending on the production, at a far cheaper price.
[35:14.460 --> 35:20.460]  Pennies on the dollar because of how it's produced and where it's produced.
[35:20.460 --> 35:28.460]  They didn't need the million-dollar machine, the $2 million building, the $100,000 in permits.
[35:29.460 --> 35:41.460]  And so they don't have to pass that on to the epilepsy patients and to the cancer patients that are taking 1,000 milligrams of CBD twice a day or 1,000 milligrams of THC twice a day.
[35:41.460 --> 35:47.460]  I had a caregiver give me a bottle that was, I think, 648 milligrams of pure THC.
[35:47.460 --> 35:49.460]  What would that cost me at a recreational expense rate?
[35:49.460 --> 35:50.460]  How many milligrams?
[35:50.460 --> 35:52.460]  648.
[35:55.460 --> 35:56.460]  $80, $90, bro.
[35:56.460 --> 35:58.460]  Oh, no, way more than that.
[36:00.460 --> 36:08.460]  Rec, you're looking at around 60 to 90 a gram for good CO2 oil.
[36:08.460 --> 36:11.460]  If it was pure CBD tincture.
[36:11.460 --> 36:13.460]  Pure CBD tincture, you're looking at?
[36:13.460 --> 36:15.460]  A little MCT oil and THC.
[36:16.460 --> 36:19.460]  I mean, you're still looking at maybe 300 bucks.
[36:19.460 --> 36:20.460]  Okay.
[36:21.460 --> 36:30.460]  We exchanged a 10-pack of seeds for that tincture because it was a caregiver to caregiver transaction for a child.
[36:32.460 --> 36:35.460]  I mean, recreationally, that would have cost a fortune.
[36:35.460 --> 36:36.460]  Yeah.
[36:36.460 --> 36:41.460]  For 160 milligrams, you're looking at, I mean, like 60 bucks.
[36:41.460 --> 36:45.460]  And I'm pretty sure he would have given it to me if I didn't even offer him the seed pack in exchange.
[36:45.460 --> 36:49.460]  But I was like, you get something, you know, like there was stuff here, so you get stuff for my stuff.
[36:49.460 --> 36:50.460]  It's how it works.
[36:50.460 --> 37:00.460]  I mean, the caregiver system is where the people that really, really need the high quality, high dose medicines, that's where they get their product.
[37:00.460 --> 37:03.460]  If I have to, I can deal with the recreational market.
[37:03.460 --> 37:04.460]  I've got a job.
[37:04.460 --> 37:10.460]  I've got access to enough cannabis product selection to keep myself on my feet and healthy enough to work.
[37:11.460 --> 37:15.460]  But there are a lot of people who can't say that in Colorado that rely on caregivers.
[37:15.460 --> 37:22.460]  And that's why I don't mind standing up and doing press or advocacy for caregivers, even though I'm not one.
[37:22.460 --> 37:24.460]  I definitely appreciate it.
[37:24.460 --> 37:31.460]  I'm sure a lot of people just don't want to be seen, even though it's more out in the open than it used to be.
[37:31.460 --> 37:37.460]  A lot of people don't want to be seen walking in to a dispensary to purchase anything.
[37:37.460 --> 37:39.460]  There's still very much a stigma.
[37:39.460 --> 37:41.460]  You can still very much lose your job.
[37:41.460 --> 37:43.460]  It's like the porn shop for some people still.
[37:43.460 --> 37:44.460]  Exactly.
[37:44.460 --> 37:45.460]  Why'd you look at me like that, Lynn?
[37:45.460 --> 37:46.460]  Because that was a good one.
[37:46.460 --> 37:48.460]  I liked that one.
[37:48.460 --> 37:50.460]  Yeah, it's the same thing as walking into the porn shop for some people.
[37:50.460 --> 37:52.460]  They just can't be seen doing that.
[37:52.460 --> 37:53.460]  Yep.
[37:53.460 --> 37:54.460]  Yeah.
[37:54.460 --> 37:57.460]  I like hope somebody sees me walking in there.
[37:57.460 --> 37:59.460]  The porn shop or the dispensary?
[37:59.460 --> 38:00.460]  Both.
[38:00.460 --> 38:06.460]  If they stalked you and watched you go to work, know that you're going to go home and have a great day?
[38:06.460 --> 38:08.460]  It's like that joke.
[38:08.460 --> 38:13.460]  You go to the porn shop and buy your wife a toy and get pulled over by the cop.
[38:13.460 --> 38:15.460]  Just what's in that bag?
[38:15.460 --> 38:16.460]  You'll be like, I don't know.
[38:16.460 --> 38:18.460]  I stole this truck.
[38:18.460 --> 38:22.460]  You have to admit that there's a sex toy in the bag.
[38:22.460 --> 38:24.460]  Right.
[38:24.460 --> 38:26.460]  That's funny.
[38:26.460 --> 38:29.460]  There's definitely a stigma attached for a lot of people.
[38:29.460 --> 38:32.460]  I still run into it regularly.
[38:32.460 --> 38:43.460]  I run into customers who are from other states who are like, I can't use the ATM in this building because my bank might know that this address is where a pot store also is.
[38:43.460 --> 38:45.460]  People are that paranoid?
[38:45.460 --> 38:46.460]  Oh, yeah.
[38:46.460 --> 38:48.460]  I mean, like a handful a day.
[38:48.460 --> 38:50.460]  It's not rare.
[38:50.460 --> 38:51.460]  I hear it all the time.
[38:51.460 --> 39:02.460]  Well, because in large parts of the rest of the country, doing what we're doing and what we're talking about at this table will land your ass in jail for an incredibly long period of time.
[39:02.460 --> 39:09.460]  These delicious chocolates we were just eating are like a serious felony in some parts of the U.S. because they're made with concentrates.
[39:09.460 --> 39:11.460]  You can pass that felony over here.
[39:11.460 --> 39:13.460]  Pass me that felony.
[39:13.460 --> 39:17.460]  I did 45 days in jail over a pack of rolling papers one time.
[39:17.460 --> 39:18.460]  In what state?
[39:18.460 --> 39:19.460]  North Carolina.
[39:19.460 --> 39:20.460]  Rolling papers?
[39:20.460 --> 39:22.460]  No weed, just rolling papers.
[39:22.460 --> 39:23.460]  Just rolling papers.
[39:23.460 --> 39:24.460]  Well, that's a great way to segue.
[39:24.460 --> 39:26.460]  You didn't even say you rolled your own cigarettes?
[39:26.460 --> 39:34.460]  Look, I said I used it for my underwear so I didn't get shit stains in my underwear.
[39:34.460 --> 39:36.460]  Can we talk a little more into the mic for that?
[39:36.460 --> 39:37.460]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[39:37.460 --> 39:38.460]  No, you're good.
[39:38.460 --> 39:39.460]  You're good.
[39:39.460 --> 39:41.460]  We're just going to make sure we get this part.
[39:41.460 --> 39:42.460]  Can you say it again?
[39:42.460 --> 39:47.460]  Okay, I told the cop, I said, well, I use those for shit so I don't get shit stains in my underwear.
[39:47.460 --> 39:50.460]  I'm coming off my asshole and it still didn't work.
[39:50.460 --> 39:54.460]  I said in court too, by the way, it was just really embarrassing.
[39:54.460 --> 39:56.460]  He gave me 45 days in jail.
[39:56.460 --> 40:01.460]  So 45 days of my life was taken away because of rolling papers.
[40:01.460 --> 40:02.460]  Rolling papers, man.
[40:02.460 --> 40:10.460]  I remember those days though when I was in band in like seventh grade, they told us to buy rolling papers for something.
[40:10.460 --> 40:15.460]  I don't even remember what about the instruments, but the paper specifically was good for us.
[40:15.460 --> 40:16.460]  Something with the read.
[40:16.460 --> 40:17.460]  Yeah.
[40:17.460 --> 40:19.460]  I mean, that's how little I pay attention to that.
[40:19.460 --> 40:20.460]  Makes it fit in the thing a little better.
[40:20.460 --> 40:22.460]  But I remember the speech in class.
[40:22.460 --> 40:25.460]  They're like, all right, what you're buying now is currently contraband.
[40:25.460 --> 40:35.460]  If law enforcement contacts you about these, you can explain that it's for your instrument and that hopefully you don't get a ticket for having what we're telling you to have.
[40:35.460 --> 40:40.460]  And that was like 20 years ago and there's still places in the country that are like that.
[40:41.460 --> 40:47.460]  Two years ago, I was a little over two years now, but two years ago I was in that hell, man.
[40:47.460 --> 40:50.460]  I mean, it was, and I went back about a year ago.
[40:50.460 --> 40:52.460]  I don't have a paranoid feeling here now.
[40:52.460 --> 40:53.460]  You know what I'm saying?
[40:53.460 --> 40:56.460]  When a cop gets behind me, I could care less.
[40:56.460 --> 40:58.460]  I got weed on me, so fucking what?
[40:58.460 --> 41:00.460]  I got a medical card too.
[41:00.460 --> 41:07.460]  But back home, I mean, you know, I was, that paranoid feeling came back and I hate it.
[41:07.460 --> 41:08.460]  I hate it.
[41:08.460 --> 41:09.460]  Your chest sinks.
[41:09.460 --> 41:10.460]  Your heart pounds a little bit.
[41:10.460 --> 41:11.460]  Your palms get sweaty.
[41:11.460 --> 41:13.460]  Eyes start twitching a little bit in the corner.
[41:13.460 --> 41:14.460]  You're like, fuck, I'm going to jail.
[41:14.460 --> 41:15.460]  I'm going to jail.
[41:15.460 --> 41:16.460]  I'm going to jail.
[41:16.460 --> 41:17.460]  I'm going to jail.
[41:17.460 --> 41:18.460]  I hate that feeling.
[41:18.460 --> 41:19.460]  I hate that shit.
[41:19.460 --> 41:22.460]  So what brought you to Colorado from North Carolina?
[41:22.460 --> 41:23.460]  This right here.
[41:23.460 --> 41:24.460]  Not that feeling.
[41:24.460 --> 41:25.460]  Not having that feeling.
[41:25.460 --> 41:26.460]  Not having that fear.
[41:26.460 --> 41:27.460]  Yeah, yeah.
[41:27.460 --> 41:28.460]  Well, welcome.
[41:28.460 --> 41:29.460]  We're glad you're here.
[41:29.460 --> 41:30.460]  I like your vibe.
[41:30.460 --> 41:31.460]  I'm glad you came on the podcast.
[41:31.460 --> 41:32.460]  Thank you.
[41:32.460 --> 41:33.460]  I'm glad you reached out to me.
[41:33.460 --> 41:34.460]  You said you work as a courier for a company.
[41:34.460 --> 41:36.460]  Yes, I work for Stratos.
[41:37.460 --> 41:39.460]  We make THC pills.
[41:39.460 --> 41:40.460]  Okay.
[41:40.460 --> 41:43.460]  And we do medical and recreational.
[41:43.460 --> 41:48.460]  We have probably the highest dose CBD probably on the market, wouldn't you say?
[41:48.460 --> 41:50.460]  15 to ones.
[41:50.460 --> 41:53.460]  So you just drop these straight into your drink and it dissolves and then you drink it?
[41:53.460 --> 41:55.460]  Yes, that's the brand new product.
[41:55.460 --> 41:56.460]  That's the brand new product.
[41:56.460 --> 42:01.460]  I was going to say, we don't have the brand new Ascent on our shelves yet, just the Stratos pills.
[42:01.460 --> 42:03.460]  That's pretty damn cool.
[42:03.460 --> 42:08.460]  They're a brand new product on the market last, what, six months?
[42:08.460 --> 42:09.460]  Yeah.
[42:09.460 --> 42:12.460]  They've been in business for about a year.
[42:12.460 --> 42:16.460]  They exploded everywhere across the state about six months ago.
[42:16.460 --> 42:18.460]  I really like them personally.
[42:18.460 --> 42:21.460]  They're a great low dose medication option.
[42:21.460 --> 42:23.460]  Their CBD products are really convenient.
[42:23.460 --> 42:25.460]  And they're available recreationally?
[42:25.460 --> 42:31.460]  Yes, recreationally up to 100 milligrams and medically up to 500 milligrams.
[42:31.460 --> 42:33.460]  And we have three different kinds.
[42:33.460 --> 42:37.460]  The Relax is like a, it's a hybrid.
[42:37.460 --> 42:44.460]  The EnerGeez, the Sativa, and then we have also one, a Sleep, that I don't have because I'm not trying to go to sleep right now.
[42:44.460 --> 42:48.460]  The Sleep, that's for going to sleep.
[42:48.460 --> 42:50.460]  A lot of people swear by them.
[42:50.460 --> 42:54.460]  The Budtenders seem to, the Sleep, I get more feedback.
[42:54.460 --> 42:57.460]  Is it just real heavily activated THCA?
[42:57.460 --> 42:58.460]  Yeah.
[42:58.460 --> 42:59.460]  Okay.
[42:59.460 --> 43:00.460]  That makes sense.
[43:00.460 --> 43:01.460]  And these are sins.
[43:01.460 --> 43:03.460]  I absolutely love them.
[43:03.460 --> 43:05.460]  I'm sitting here and drunk this whole tea.
[43:05.460 --> 43:07.460]  He just medicated a Snapple.
[43:07.460 --> 43:09.460]  Yeah, I watched him drop it into the Snapple and shake it up.
[43:09.460 --> 43:10.460]  I was like, what you got in there?
[43:10.460 --> 43:11.460]  And he's like, THC.
[43:11.460 --> 43:16.460]  We discussed medicating my Mountain Dew and decided that was not safe around all this electrical equipment.
[43:16.460 --> 43:18.460]  Yeah, it may fizz up a little bit.
[43:18.460 --> 43:21.460]  It would be better to probably medicate one of these water bottles.
[43:21.460 --> 43:24.460]  Yeah, from what I understand, you can medicate any beverage?
[43:24.460 --> 43:25.460]  Any beverage.
[43:25.460 --> 43:26.460]  It has no flavor to it?
[43:26.460 --> 43:31.460]  No, it works like a kind of Alka-Seltzer.
[43:31.460 --> 43:35.460]  If you look at them, they kind of look like Alka-Seltzer pills.
[43:35.460 --> 43:36.460]  Okay.
[43:36.460 --> 43:39.460]  And yeah, it'll fizz up.
[43:39.460 --> 43:44.460]  And there is kind of a taste in like a carbonated beverage, I can taste it.
[43:44.460 --> 43:49.460]  But like in this tea, and I've tried it in juice as well, there's not really much.
[43:49.460 --> 43:50.460]  There's no real mild flavor?
[43:50.460 --> 43:51.460]  Yes.
[43:51.460 --> 43:52.460]  Nice.
[43:52.460 --> 43:53.460]  Mild for sure.
[43:54.460 --> 44:03.460]  A lot of drinks have a heavy flavor, so an option that I can A, medicate whatever beverage I want without adding tincture, which is always a little weird.
[44:03.460 --> 44:07.460]  I do like the sodas, but you can taste that medicine-y.
[44:07.460 --> 44:11.460]  You can taste the medicine-y and then they're also kind of weedy tasting.
[44:11.460 --> 44:16.460]  I like my edible, like these codas right here, they don't have that weedy taste.
[44:16.460 --> 44:17.460]  Right.
[44:17.460 --> 44:19.460]  I'm not a horse, I don't need to eat the flowers.
[44:19.460 --> 44:21.460]  I just need to get that THC in there.
[44:21.460 --> 44:23.460]  Lindsay, you doing yoga in your chair over there?
[44:23.460 --> 44:24.460]  What's going on?
[44:24.460 --> 44:29.460]  Okay, so I was just laughing because I was halfway through it and I was like, damn, Jeff's going to call me out on this.
[44:29.460 --> 44:35.460]  But like, man, Brett really had it right in the last one when he did like the stretches in the middle of the podcast.
[44:35.460 --> 44:38.460]  Like, shout out to you, Brett, you're really killing it.
[44:38.460 --> 44:40.460]  Dude, he kills it on Facebook or on Instagram.
[44:40.460 --> 44:42.460]  Brett posts the greatest shit on Instagram.
[44:42.460 --> 44:45.460]  Shout out to Eva Labs, at Mary's.
[44:45.460 --> 44:48.460]  You know, he has a fake, so make sure you follow the right one.
[44:48.460 --> 44:49.460]  Yeah, Mary's Motivation.
[44:50.460 --> 44:52.460]  Yeah, shout out to the correct Mary's Motivation.
[44:52.460 --> 44:53.460]  Mary's underscore motivation.
[44:53.460 --> 44:56.460]  If he's only got two posts, it's the fake one, don't follow him.
[44:56.460 --> 44:59.460]  Yeah, you should know how to spell motivation.
[44:59.460 --> 45:00.460]  Yeah.
[45:04.460 --> 45:08.460]  So you're a courier and you get to go to probably almost half of the dispensaries in the state.
[45:08.460 --> 45:09.460]  At least, yes.
[45:09.460 --> 45:10.460]  What's that like?
[45:10.460 --> 45:11.460]  I love it.
[45:11.460 --> 45:14.460]  That's a great variety, medical and recreationally.
[45:14.460 --> 45:15.460]  Yes, ma'am.
[45:15.460 --> 45:16.460]  Oh, that's exciting.
[45:16.460 --> 45:17.460]  It makes me real jealous.
[45:17.460 --> 45:22.460]  It's a gorgeous state and I would love to spend part of my day every day driving around it.
[45:22.460 --> 45:23.460]  But after a while.
[45:23.460 --> 45:26.460]  Keep in mind, it's September now, so in a couple of weeks.
[45:26.460 --> 45:29.460]  That's going to turn into an extreme sport.
[45:29.460 --> 45:31.460]  Fuck, now I have to drive across the fucking state every day.
[45:31.460 --> 45:34.460]  Yeah, it's no fun in the winter.
[45:34.460 --> 45:38.460]  There's three months out of the year where it's okay to drive across the state.
[45:38.460 --> 45:39.460]  Oh, it's beautiful, yeah.
[45:39.460 --> 45:44.460]  You know, the independent pass is open right now, but they shut that down during the wintertime.
[45:44.460 --> 45:47.460]  The social media feeds, the photos are amazing.
[45:47.460 --> 45:48.460]  Oh, yeah.
[45:48.460 --> 45:49.460]  I love it.
[45:49.460 --> 45:50.460]  I love it.
[45:50.460 --> 45:51.460]  So, we did an episode.
[45:51.460 --> 45:53.460]  You're a podcast listener, so you probably listened to it.
[45:53.460 --> 45:56.460]  We talked about the craziest shit that people have seen in a dispensary.
[45:56.460 --> 46:00.460]  Going to all these dispensaries, I'm sure you've seen something crazy.
[46:00.460 --> 46:02.460]  Like, what do you mean crazy?
[46:02.460 --> 46:04.460]  Just something that stands out.
[46:04.460 --> 46:06.460]  Something that you'd want to share with a bunch of people that listen on a podcast.
[46:06.460 --> 46:10.460]  Anything you've seen, either at a dispensary or at like a smoke lounge or a smoke event.
[46:11.460 --> 46:14.460]  Whatever craziness you've seen at an industry event or facility.
[46:14.460 --> 46:16.460]  Yeah, give me a minute to think about it.
[46:16.460 --> 46:17.460]  Okay.
[46:17.460 --> 46:20.460]  Because there's a few things I'm trying to narrow it down.
[46:20.460 --> 46:22.460]  I'll let you light that joint and think about it.
[46:22.460 --> 46:27.460]  He's lightened up one of the, he's got the sativas from Altitude Organic Medicine.
[46:27.460 --> 46:29.460]  Premium can of cones, five high-grade cones.
[46:29.460 --> 46:32.460]  Says there may be health risks associated with this product.
[46:32.460 --> 46:34.460]  Bullshit, you'll feel really good.
[46:34.460 --> 46:37.460]  It'll kill your cancer and you'll have a smile on your face.
[46:37.460 --> 46:40.460]  This strain is Ed Rosenthal Super Bud.
[46:40.460 --> 46:42.460]  Oh, the Ed Rosenthal Super Bud.
[46:42.460 --> 46:43.460]  Nice, that's a great strain.
[46:43.460 --> 46:45.460]  I know a dude that grew that for several years.
[46:45.460 --> 46:46.460]  Oh, really?
[46:46.460 --> 46:47.460]  Yeah, yeah.
[46:47.460 --> 46:49.460]  I'm looking at the, I'm at the end of the table, guys.
[46:49.460 --> 46:57.460]  And I'm looking down the table and I see at least eight mainstream cannabis companies.
[46:57.460 --> 46:59.460]  I mean, different companies' products.
[46:59.460 --> 47:02.460]  Vastly different types of products.
[47:02.460 --> 47:03.460]  Yeah.
[47:03.460 --> 47:10.460]  Just this afternoon I was reading an article that was saying Colorado doesn't have real legalization.
[47:10.460 --> 47:13.460]  It hurts.
[47:13.460 --> 47:25.460]  There are people that are going to vote against legalization this November because they're worried they won't make enough money when their state ends up exactly like Colorado is now.
[47:25.460 --> 47:26.460]  And it's insane.
[47:26.460 --> 47:33.460]  I can't believe you'd vote to risk going to jail and keeping it the way it is because of something silly like that.
[47:33.460 --> 47:38.460]  There's a lot of scared people that are afraid of change in this world.
[47:38.460 --> 47:39.460]  People hate change.
[47:39.460 --> 47:43.460]  I was a black market grower for far too long.
[47:43.460 --> 47:51.460]  And it's much more comfortable having shifted to having this badge around my neck all the time and knowing that what I'm doing is not shady.
[47:51.460 --> 47:52.460]  You know what I mean?
[47:52.460 --> 47:53.460]  Like I'm actually doing something.
[47:53.460 --> 47:54.460]  I'm on a camera.
[47:54.460 --> 47:55.460]  You can watch me all day.
[47:55.460 --> 47:56.460]  What I'm doing is where I was.
[47:56.460 --> 47:58.460]  So much easier that way.
[47:58.460 --> 47:59.460]  I still run a bit.
[47:59.460 --> 48:02.460]  But they hit pretty nice for a pre-roll.
[48:02.460 --> 48:06.460]  Yeah, they roll better joints than this, to be honest.
[48:06.460 --> 48:09.460]  I think they probably just pack a bunch of cones all day.
[48:09.460 --> 48:12.460]  I've made 900 pre-rolls in a shift before.
[48:12.460 --> 48:14.460]  I have to hear your pain.
[48:14.460 --> 48:17.460]  I was just going to say they probably got a monkey in the corner.
[48:17.460 --> 48:18.460]  Yeah, for sure.
[48:18.460 --> 48:19.460]  Mike's been that monkey.
[48:19.460 --> 48:24.460]  Me too, but I also make sure that they roll and burn a little bit.
[48:25.460 --> 48:26.460]  We're a judgmental crew.
[48:26.460 --> 48:29.460]  The first one canoed a little bit.
[48:29.460 --> 48:31.460]  I called the first one Usain Bolt.
[48:31.460 --> 48:33.460]  That first one could have been the Olympics.
[48:33.460 --> 48:34.460]  It was running so fast.
[48:34.460 --> 48:35.460]  This one just kind of.
[48:35.460 --> 48:37.460]  So, yeah, sorry, Altitude.
[48:37.460 --> 48:39.460]  We didn't mean to just completely bash your pre-rolls.
[48:39.460 --> 48:40.460]  No, you're good.
[48:40.460 --> 48:42.460]  I've sold worse.
[48:44.460 --> 48:45.460]  I've rolled worse.
[48:45.460 --> 48:47.460]  Yep, I've definitely rolled worse too.
[48:47.460 --> 48:50.460]  The best is when you're at a concert and you're like, I'm going to fire up this joint.
[48:50.460 --> 48:52.460]  And you light it and it's just fucking running.
[48:52.460 --> 48:54.460]  I'm like, God damn, I've got to light the other side.
[48:54.460 --> 48:56.460]  And then that part falls apart like this one just did.
[48:56.460 --> 48:59.460]  You can see a guy next to you go from excited to disappointed.
[48:59.460 --> 49:04.460]  I'll just give that guy next to me the runny joint and fire up another one.
[49:04.460 --> 49:06.460]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[49:07.460 --> 49:11.460]  Actually, I couldn't smoke any weed the front row at Reggae on the Rocks.
[49:11.460 --> 49:14.460]  That's the only bad part about the front row.
[49:14.460 --> 49:18.460]  You go for a little walk and sneak off by the trees and smoke a little bit of weed.
[49:18.460 --> 49:19.460]  Yeah, exactly.
[49:19.460 --> 49:20.460]  He shook the bottle.
[49:20.460 --> 49:23.460]  At Reggae on the Rocks, I asked a couple of people, I was like, how's the check?
[49:23.460 --> 49:25.460]  And they're like, oh, they're just going to pat you down and they'll let you through.
[49:25.460 --> 49:26.460]  Bullshit.
[49:26.460 --> 49:28.460]  They almost got the gloves out.
[49:28.460 --> 49:32.460]  They were taking shit from fucking everybody at Reggae on the Rocks.
[49:32.460 --> 49:36.460]  But they were cool about it because they'd pull your pipe out or pull whatever they found.
[49:36.460 --> 49:39.460]  They didn't find my shit, but they'd pull it out and they'd be like, all right, check it out.
[49:39.460 --> 49:41.460]  I'll give you the option to take this to your car.
[49:41.460 --> 49:42.460]  You're not bringing this in.
[49:42.460 --> 49:45.460]  But when you come back, if I find this on you again, we have to call the cops.
[49:45.460 --> 49:46.460]  We're turning you into the police.
[49:46.460 --> 49:48.460]  And the camera right there and the camera right there just saw you.
[49:48.460 --> 49:49.460]  So don't fucking do it again.
[49:49.460 --> 49:50.460]  That's cool.
[49:50.460 --> 49:51.460]  Yeah.
[49:51.460 --> 49:52.460]  I feel that.
[49:52.460 --> 49:55.460]  You get the pass at least as long as you're chill.
[49:55.460 --> 49:56.460]  The one little chick was like.
[49:56.460 --> 49:58.460]  Take the pass.
[49:58.460 --> 49:59.460]  It's just for the record.
[49:59.460 --> 50:04.460]  I'm pretty sure the one security guard lady was a prison guard by day or a prison guard by night and a Red Rocks.
[50:04.460 --> 50:07.460]  They stopped fucking around at concert venues a long time ago.
[50:07.460 --> 50:11.460]  Yeah, she's like, arms up, take your sweater off your waist, take your hat off.
[50:11.460 --> 50:12.460]  First, I'm going to touch you here.
[50:12.460 --> 50:13.460]  Then I'm going to touch you here.
[50:13.460 --> 50:14.460]  Then I'm going to touch you here.
[50:14.460 --> 50:16.460]  Now I want to check by your dick.
[50:16.460 --> 50:17.460]  Is that OK?
[50:17.460 --> 50:18.460]  Red Rocks, nice.
[50:18.460 --> 50:19.460]  Can I grab it?
[50:19.460 --> 50:22.460]  Red Rocks got sued because a couple of people got injured.
[50:22.460 --> 50:23.460]  I don't remember exactly.
[50:23.460 --> 50:24.460]  Some rocks fell.
[50:24.460 --> 50:26.460]  Some rocks fell because of fucking climbers.
[50:26.460 --> 50:32.460]  But right before that, they really started looking at security and making some improvements inside.
[50:32.460 --> 50:34.460]  It's a completely different place.
[50:34.460 --> 50:40.460]  My first Red Rocks show, I think, was Fish in 95, 6995.
[50:40.460 --> 50:41.460]  Saw Fish there.
[50:41.460 --> 50:42.460]  And it was basically a big.
[50:42.460 --> 50:46.460]  Hard to judge a venue's security from the night Fish played.
[50:46.460 --> 50:47.460]  Dude, I climbed up.
[50:49.460 --> 50:51.460]  It was a giant dirt field.
[50:51.460 --> 50:56.460]  It was a giant dirt and cactus and fucking brush fire waiting to happen type of field.
[50:56.460 --> 51:01.460]  And if we were a hippie wearing sandals, it was just a big toe fucking damaging spot.
[51:01.460 --> 51:05.460]  I remember Red Rocks when I was a teenager, and it wasn't just a concert.
[51:05.460 --> 51:06.460]  It was an adventure.
[51:07.460 --> 51:09.460]  It's still slightly an adventure.
[51:09.460 --> 51:11.460]  If you're not into uphill, if you've got weak legs and shitty lungs.
[51:11.460 --> 51:13.460]  Be ready to hike in the heat.
[51:13.460 --> 51:15.460]  And then throw that water bottle away before you enter the venue.
[51:15.460 --> 51:17.460]  I kind of challenged myself a little bit.
[51:17.460 --> 51:18.460]  I was like, I'm just going to do this shit.
[51:18.460 --> 51:19.460]  Let's go.
[51:19.460 --> 51:21.460]  And I did well.
[51:21.460 --> 51:23.460]  I can control my breathing quite well.
[51:23.460 --> 51:26.460]  And I've got fucking these climber legs because I'm so tall.
[51:26.460 --> 51:27.460]  I got a lot of leverage.
[51:27.460 --> 51:29.460]  So I can just go up that hill all day fucking long.
[51:29.460 --> 51:31.460]  Well, I just go prepared.
[51:31.460 --> 51:33.460]  I'm not in fit or in shape.
[51:33.460 --> 51:37.460]  I just know that I'm going to get my ass whipped a little bit before I get to my seat.
[51:37.460 --> 51:38.460]  Sometimes a lot.
[51:38.460 --> 51:42.460]  Shorts, a t-shirt, a long sleeve shirt, a rain poncho, a bottle of water.
[51:42.460 --> 51:44.460]  It's a fucking place.
[51:44.460 --> 51:47.460]  I spent five hours on those stone steps waiting for the doors to open one day.
[51:47.460 --> 51:49.460]  Like bacon in the summer sun.
[51:49.460 --> 51:51.460]  I did that once waiting for fish in 95.
[51:51.460 --> 51:54.460]  But I ate so much acid that I didn't know where I was anymore.
[51:54.460 --> 51:55.460]  So it didn't matter.
[51:55.460 --> 51:57.460]  That five hours for like.
[51:57.460 --> 51:59.460]  I was just fucking floating around.
[51:59.460 --> 52:00.460]  It was great.
[52:00.460 --> 52:01.460]  I had no idea what was going on.
[52:01.460 --> 52:02.460]  It was a great time.
[52:02.460 --> 52:06.460]  But now Red Rocks looks like a state park.
[52:06.460 --> 52:08.460]  It looks, it's really clean.
[52:08.460 --> 52:09.460]  It's cement.
[52:09.460 --> 52:10.460]  It's all cemented everywhere.
[52:10.460 --> 52:12.460]  A lot of the parking is now cement.
[52:12.460 --> 52:14.460]  It's not like it used to be in 95.
[52:14.460 --> 52:15.460]  It's completely different.
[52:15.460 --> 52:21.460]  In 96, I snuck over the back of the stage and watched the Allman Brothers band from the rocks behind the stage for free.
[52:21.460 --> 52:26.460]  This year I saw somebody up there and I'm 99% sure security fucking climbed up there and arrested those motherfuckers.
[52:26.460 --> 52:28.460]  And they got like a $10,000 ticket.
[52:28.460 --> 52:30.460]  So you can't do that shit anymore.
[52:30.460 --> 52:31.460]  Red Rocks has changed.
[52:31.460 --> 52:33.460]  They almost got the glove out and I was waiting.
[52:33.460 --> 52:34.460]  I was like, so you're going to get the glove or what?
[52:34.460 --> 52:36.460]  Because you didn't find what you're looking for yet.
[52:36.460 --> 52:38.460]  Like I've got gloves.
[52:38.460 --> 52:41.460]  Pull it out of your pocket for them.
[52:41.460 --> 52:42.460]  Is this what you need, lady?
[52:42.460 --> 52:43.460]  You need a blue glove.
[52:43.460 --> 52:44.460]  You want this.
[52:44.460 --> 52:46.460]  I got the black pH gloves.
[52:46.460 --> 52:47.460]  That's gross.
[52:47.460 --> 52:48.460]  Oh man.
[52:48.460 --> 52:49.460]  Yeah.
[52:49.460 --> 52:50.460]  Red Rocks.
[52:50.460 --> 52:51.460]  How did we get there?
[52:51.460 --> 52:52.460]  That was crazy.
[52:52.460 --> 52:53.460]  It's been a long and strange show.
[52:53.460 --> 52:55.460]  Hashtag I like it when you ramble.
[52:55.460 --> 52:58.460]  Did you think of a crazy dispensary story?
[52:58.460 --> 53:00.460]  I wasn't going to put them on the spot.
[53:00.460 --> 53:01.460]  I was thinking it would just come.
[53:01.460 --> 53:02.460]  I was thinking it would just come to me.
[53:02.460 --> 53:04.460]  Let me focus on you.
[53:04.460 --> 53:06.460]  I was listening to you, man.
[53:06.460 --> 53:07.460]  I mean, you're talking about Red Rocks.
[53:07.460 --> 53:08.460]  I'm like.
[53:08.460 --> 53:09.460]  Have you been to Red Rocks yet?
[53:09.460 --> 53:10.460]  No.
[53:10.460 --> 53:11.460]  You got to hit a concert there this year.
[53:11.460 --> 53:20.460]  You know, the only concerts I've been in Colorado is the little ones they've had up in the little
[53:20.460 --> 53:22.460]  dab bars up in the springs.
[53:22.460 --> 53:23.460]  Yeah.
[53:23.460 --> 53:24.460]  I like that, Bob.
[53:24.460 --> 53:25.460]  I don't know.
[53:25.460 --> 53:26.460]  Have you ever been to one of those?
[53:26.460 --> 53:30.460]  I haven't been to the concerts there, but I've been to plenty of the dab bars.
[53:30.460 --> 53:35.460]  I've actually got tickets to see Jeff Tate and Emma Arnold at the dab lounge this Thursday.
[53:35.460 --> 53:39.460]  So by the time this podcast airs, I think I will have seen that show.
[53:39.460 --> 53:40.460]  It was fucking great, you guys.
[53:40.460 --> 53:41.460]  You should have been there.
[53:41.460 --> 53:42.460]  It was awesome.
[53:42.460 --> 53:46.460]  I might be there actually now that you told me about it.
[53:46.460 --> 53:47.460]  Yeah.
[53:47.460 --> 53:48.460]  Tomorrow night?
[53:48.460 --> 53:49.460]  Yeah, tomorrow night.
[53:49.460 --> 53:50.460]  Shit, that's tomorrow night.
[53:50.460 --> 53:51.460]  That's why we're recording tonight.
[53:51.460 --> 53:52.460]  It's tomorrow night.
[53:52.460 --> 53:53.460]  I think the show's at 710.
[53:53.460 --> 53:54.460]  You can get your tickets on a friend of mine's Facebook page.
[53:54.460 --> 53:57.460]  I'll link you up with them or just go to the dab lounge's Facebook page and there's a link.
[53:57.460 --> 53:59.460]  Tickets are like five bucks, dude.
[53:59.460 --> 54:03.460]  I'm going to go to Christian Butte tomorrow, so we'll see when I get back.
[54:03.460 --> 54:04.460]  Yeah.
[54:04.460 --> 54:07.460]  I think it's like seven bucks at the door, so you're not going to spend too much money.
[54:08.460 --> 54:09.460]  That's going to be awesome.
[54:09.460 --> 54:10.460]  What is it?
[54:10.460 --> 54:11.460]  I'm off tomorrow, so what is it?
[54:11.460 --> 54:15.460]  It's a comedian named Jeff Tate and his friend Emma Arnold, and they are doing a show called
[54:15.460 --> 54:16.460]  Good Cop, Bad Cop.
[54:16.460 --> 54:17.460]  Are you going to be there?
[54:17.460 --> 54:18.460]  Yeah.
[54:18.460 --> 54:19.460]  Okay.
[54:19.460 --> 54:20.460]  All right.
[54:20.460 --> 54:21.460]  I got it.
[54:21.460 --> 54:22.460]  Your microphone is getting all limpy.
[54:22.460 --> 54:23.460]  I know.
[54:23.460 --> 54:24.460]  I know.
[54:24.460 --> 54:25.460]  I know how to fix it, but I need a screwdriver to do it.
[54:25.460 --> 54:26.460]  It's okay.
[54:26.460 --> 54:27.460]  I'm cool.
[54:27.460 --> 54:28.460]  Sorry.
[54:28.460 --> 54:29.460]  I didn't mean for it to do that to you.
[54:29.460 --> 54:30.460]  It's never done that before.
[54:30.460 --> 54:31.460]  I'm glad it can't perform for me.
[54:31.460 --> 54:32.460]  Poor mic stand.
[54:32.460 --> 54:33.460]  It's all embarrassed now.
[54:33.460 --> 54:34.460]  I know.
[54:35.460 --> 54:42.460]  The strangest dispenser story I probably have.
[54:42.460 --> 54:44.460]  This actually happened in town.
[54:44.460 --> 54:45.460]  Oh, of course.
[54:45.460 --> 54:46.460]  Yes.
[54:46.460 --> 54:49.460]  Pueblo's the ... It's a hell of a town.
[54:49.460 --> 54:50.460]  There's one spot.
[54:50.460 --> 54:55.460]  I'm not going to say the name of it, but it's ghetto.
[54:55.460 --> 54:58.460]  Okay, so ... Okay.
[54:58.460 --> 55:00.460]  This is ghetto.
[55:01.460 --> 55:06.460]  It has a ... Well, I'll probably give it away right here, but there's a laundromat beside it.
[55:06.460 --> 55:07.460]  Okay.
[55:07.460 --> 55:15.460]  So, we go ... Two weeks ago, we go birthday joint shopping because it was my friend's
[55:15.460 --> 55:21.460]  birthday and she was ... Some places give you birthday joints for coming in and shopping.
[55:21.460 --> 55:22.460]  Was it Sol's birthday?
[55:22.460 --> 55:23.460]  Yes, it was.
[55:23.460 --> 55:24.460]  Happy birthday, Sol.
[55:24.460 --> 55:26.460]  I don't know if you listened to the podcast or not, but happy birthday.
[55:27.460 --> 55:32.460]  So, it was her birthday and we went to this place and start walking up and this guy comes
[55:32.460 --> 55:33.460]  from out of nowhere.
[55:33.460 --> 55:36.460]  Sol said he come out of the laundromat.
[55:36.460 --> 55:41.460]  I don't know, but he just kind of popped up on us.
[55:41.460 --> 55:44.460]  And it just blew my mind.
[55:44.460 --> 55:47.460]  There was nobody in the dispensary but him.
[55:47.460 --> 55:51.460]  He didn't know anything about any of the product.
[55:51.460 --> 55:55.460]  I'm like ... So, I asked him if they had some of our product in there.
[55:55.460 --> 55:57.460]  I said, what do you know about these right here?
[55:57.460 --> 55:58.460]  He said, I don't know.
[55:58.460 --> 55:59.460]  I don't take pills.
[55:59.460 --> 56:01.460]  He was the worst salesman I've ever seen.
[56:01.460 --> 56:03.460]  It's not hard to sell a joint.
[56:03.460 --> 56:04.460]  You know what I mean?
[56:04.460 --> 56:05.460]  Yeah, yeah.
[56:05.460 --> 56:06.460]  Because you come in there for one reason.
[56:06.460 --> 56:08.460]  Not hard to sell a joint.
[56:08.460 --> 56:10.460]  I can confirm the shit out of that.
[56:10.460 --> 56:13.460]  But he couldn't have sold me ice water if I was thirsty.
[56:13.460 --> 56:15.460]  I mean, he was awful.
[56:15.460 --> 56:16.460]  That's terrible.
[56:16.460 --> 56:18.460]  And that's just the most recent one.
[56:18.460 --> 56:20.460]  I'm sure I'll come up with another one.
[56:20.460 --> 56:22.460]  Did he even have a badge around his neck?
[56:22.460 --> 56:24.460]  You know, I didn't even look for that.
[56:24.460 --> 56:26.460]  He was so unprofessional.
[56:26.460 --> 56:27.460]  You should have left with it.
[56:29.460 --> 56:30.460]  Snatched his badge.
[56:30.460 --> 56:31.460]  My badge of honor.
[56:31.460 --> 56:33.460]  Like 50 cent taking someone's chain.
[56:33.460 --> 56:35.460]  So, I just smoked a blunt, you guys.
[56:35.460 --> 56:38.460]  I don't hit blunts very often, and I just took a hit off of a blunt.
[56:38.460 --> 56:45.460]  I actually have a very rare picture on my phone of Jeffrey hitting a backwood.
[56:45.460 --> 56:49.460]  A big, sloppy, drooly, funky backwood.
[56:49.460 --> 56:50.460]  I swear to God.
[56:50.460 --> 56:53.460]  He was, like, moving in the picture, and it's blurry, and I don't care.
[56:53.460 --> 56:55.460]  Because you can clearly see the backwood.
[56:55.460 --> 56:57.460]  You can clearly see it's him.
[56:57.460 --> 57:00.460]  So, like, I was trying so hard, so fast to get it.
[57:00.460 --> 57:02.460]  Dude, if you can tell it's Bigfoot, it counts.
[57:02.460 --> 57:03.460]  Yeah, for sure.
[57:03.460 --> 57:04.460]  Shout out to my boy Adam Hill.
[57:04.460 --> 57:05.460]  What?
[57:05.460 --> 57:08.460]  My friend Adam Hill is sponsored by backwoods.
[57:08.460 --> 57:13.460]  And he smokes a lot of backwoods, and he rolled up a big old backwood.
[57:13.460 --> 57:15.460]  You talking about those nasty cigars?
[57:15.460 --> 57:16.460]  Yes.
[57:16.460 --> 57:17.460]  Oh, my God.
[57:17.460 --> 57:18.460]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[57:18.460 --> 57:19.460]  He licks them.
[57:19.460 --> 57:20.460]  Dutch life.
[57:20.460 --> 57:23.460]  He licks it up like it's the nastiest.
[57:23.460 --> 57:30.460]  He posted a video the other day that was, like, he said something that was, like, extra saliva or something like that.
[57:30.460 --> 57:31.460]  Yeah.
[57:31.460 --> 57:33.460]  My grandpa, he used to chew them things.
[57:33.460 --> 57:34.460]  That's pretty much what Adam does.
[57:34.460 --> 57:36.460]  He chews the end of it while he's smoking on it.
[57:36.460 --> 57:40.460]  Oh, he would break a piece off and chew it in his damn mouth, man.
[57:40.460 --> 57:41.460]  Your grandpa's a damn man.
[57:41.460 --> 57:42.460]  He was.
[57:42.460 --> 57:44.460]  He was a real fucking man right there.
[57:44.460 --> 57:46.460]  I'm going to get a stomachache thinking about that.
[57:47.460 --> 57:49.460]  I wasn't even going to cough or even laugh.
[57:49.460 --> 57:51.460]  Your grandpa's a man.
[57:51.460 --> 57:55.460]  Back when men were men and the life expectancy was, like, 46.
[57:55.460 --> 57:56.460]  Yeah, yeah.
[57:56.460 --> 57:58.460]  I'll chew the damn thing.
[57:58.460 --> 58:05.460]  No, but I've met people that did that before that either just nod directly on a backwood or used it as chewing tobacco.
[58:05.460 --> 58:08.460]  I've met people that, I don't know how people do it.
[58:08.460 --> 58:09.460]  I have no idea.
[58:09.460 --> 58:11.460]  I grew up in tobacco farmland.
[58:11.460 --> 58:12.460]  That's where I'm from.
[58:12.460 --> 58:13.460]  I'm from the Tar Heels.
[58:14.460 --> 58:16.460]  That was kind of normal.
[58:16.460 --> 58:17.460]  You know what I mean?
[58:17.460 --> 58:19.460]  I'm sure he raised tobacco.
[58:19.460 --> 58:23.460]  My mama used to tell me how she used to pick it when she was five years old.
[58:23.460 --> 58:26.460]  I just felt so bad for her because this is some rough work.
[58:26.460 --> 58:27.460]  Yeah, yeah.
[58:27.460 --> 58:31.460]  So I'm sure he probably just threw a whole leaf in his mouth.
[58:31.460 --> 58:32.460]  Yeah.
[58:32.460 --> 58:33.460]  It was pretty rugged.
[58:33.460 --> 58:35.460]  I get really lit up when I smoke blunts.
[58:35.460 --> 58:39.460]  Something about that tobacco leaf just really makes me spin around and get some.
[58:39.460 --> 58:40.460]  It's because you don't smoke tobacco.
[58:40.460 --> 58:41.460]  It's the same thing with me.
[58:41.460 --> 58:42.460]  It's the same thing with me.
[58:42.460 --> 58:44.460]  Oh, so you don't smoke cigarettes.
[58:44.460 --> 58:45.460]  No, I barely even smoke joints.
[58:45.460 --> 58:48.460]  Mostly just dabs is my world lately.
[58:48.460 --> 58:50.460]  That's when I was a rare night.
[58:50.460 --> 58:51.460]  He just hit everything that's been passed.
[58:51.460 --> 58:52.460]  Yeah.
[58:52.460 --> 58:53.460]  I try to be polite.
[58:53.460 --> 58:54.460]  I try to have some fun.
[58:54.460 --> 58:56.460]  You're not trying to strat us, dude.
[58:56.460 --> 58:58.460]  Yeah, I'm not going for any of the edibles.
[58:58.460 --> 59:00.460]  I'm trying to politely avoid all of that stuff.
[59:00.460 --> 59:01.460]  Come on, dude.
[59:01.460 --> 59:02.460]  All the cool kids are doing it.
[59:02.460 --> 59:05.460]  I'm highly offended that you're not eating any of the edibles.
[59:05.460 --> 59:07.460]  You're finally getting peer pressure.
[59:07.460 --> 59:08.460]  She just ran.
[59:08.460 --> 59:10.460]  There's people in the house that are not on the podcast.
[59:10.460 --> 59:12.460]  And when they were offered some of the stratos, they just took off.
[59:12.460 --> 59:14.460]  If you want that, it's over here where you can reach it.
[59:14.460 --> 59:16.460]  All you got to do is come eat that.
[59:16.460 --> 59:17.460]  We ain't going to peer pressure you, though.
[59:17.460 --> 59:19.460]  If I can get my company to talk to you.
[59:19.460 --> 59:20.460]  No, for real.
[59:20.460 --> 59:21.460]  If you want to put that in a drink.
[59:21.460 --> 59:23.460]  Entering the Cannabis Cup this year, I think that's a winner, dude.
[59:23.460 --> 59:26.460]  These won the Cannabis Cup this year, by the way.
[59:26.460 --> 59:28.460]  The Codas did, yep.
[59:28.460 --> 59:32.460]  Dude, if you guys want any of these, I've got all the flavors.
[59:32.460 --> 59:33.460]  Dive in.
[59:33.460 --> 59:34.460]  Don't play around.
[59:34.460 --> 59:36.460]  Seriously, sample.
[59:36.460 --> 59:37.460]  I'm off tomorrow.
[59:37.460 --> 59:38.460]  I'm off tomorrow.
[59:38.460 --> 59:39.460]  How many more times?
[59:39.460 --> 59:40.460]  Like, stop.
[59:40.460 --> 59:42.460]  Lindsey, I had to stop at work.
[59:42.460 --> 59:44.460]  I had the day off, and I had to stop at work for something.
[59:44.460 --> 59:48.460]  And I'd had people ask me for them or ask me if we carried them.
[59:48.460 --> 59:53.460]  And so I just grabbed both kinds that we carried and brought them for fun.
[59:53.460 --> 59:54.460]  Dive in.
[59:54.460 --> 59:55.460]  Did you try that monkey bar?
[59:55.460 --> 59:58.460]  Not yet, but it's on the do list.
[59:58.460 --> 01:00:03.460]  They don't pay me to say this at all, but that monkey bar from Incredibles is one of my very favorite edibles that's ever been made.
[01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:04.460]  Oh, well, then I'll leave a piece here.
[01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:05.460]  No, no, take it.
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:06.460]  Because I'm not going to eat it.
[01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:07.460]  I'm not going to eat it.
[01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:08.460]  You've got to try one of those.
[01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:09.460]  I've got a lot of edibles in my.
[01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:13.460]  How much did you eat?
[01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:16.460]  So, yeah, this is why I don't do edibles for a minute.
[01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:17.460]  We've hit this twice.
[01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:21.460]  Within a 12-hour period, I consumed over 2,500 milligrams of edibles.
[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:23.460]  You don't have to say anything else, bro.
[01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:24.460]  I feel you.
[01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:25.460]  Yeah, so I'm just taking a break.
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:32.460]  I can't go over, like, 30 or 40 myself because, you know.
[01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:35.460]  Well, like, 600 or 700 was hard for me.
[01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:37.460]  That was when I was going in, and then I did 1,000.
[01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:38.460]  I'm on the floor, man.
[01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:39.460]  I'm on the floor.
[01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:47.460]  I've got to completely stay still because if I even move my head a little bit, I'm ralphing right into a.
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:50.460]  See, I go real light with edibles to 10.
[01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:51.460]  No.
[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:52.460]  10, I don't really feel.
[01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:57.460]  It just makes symptom management significantly better.
[01:00:57.460 --> 01:01:00.460]  That's what I like about the Stratos specifically.
[01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:05.460]  But other stuff, 25, 30 milligrams is fun.
[01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:11.460]  Any more than that, and I'm, like, not fun in public high.
[01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:13.460]  I had to go to work.
[01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:15.460]  2,500, I'd be toasted for days.
[01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:16.460]  I woke up still high.
[01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:18.460]  I was still high when I woke up.
[01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:22.460]  My eyes, I'm wearing my iRegenetics logo shirt, and this red print is dark, dark red.
[01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:23.460]  My eyes were that red.
[01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:24.460]  Yeah, that's for you, brother.
[01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:25.460]  Enjoy that water.
[01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:26.460]  All right, awesome.
[01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:27.460]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:28.460]  I'm high, though.
[01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:29.460]  I see, man.
[01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:30.460]  I can't.
[01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:31.460]  I don't know if I want to.
[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:33.460]  Drop a tea to see in there.
[01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:34.460]  I'm already went one.
[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:35.460]  See, I like to eat.
[01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:36.460]  I want to watch it work.
[01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:37.460]  It looks like.
[01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:38.460]  So you can see the bubbles?
[01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:39.460]  Yeah, I want y'all to see the bubbles.
[01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:40.460]  Is it like Alka-Seltzer, kind of?
[01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:41.460]  Yes, sir.
[01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:42.460]  Is that what you described it as?
[01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:43.460]  Yes, sir.
[01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:44.460]  All right, here, I'll pass those to you.
[01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:45.460]  We're going to watch this happen.
[01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:51.460]  I like to eat the smallest physical, like, thing with the highest milligrams.
[01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:52.460]  So, like, those.
[01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:54.460]  Oh, it's very similar to the Alka-Seltzer.
[01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:57.460]  Those small gummies, the one gummies that are 100 milligrams, or that one piece.
[01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:58.460]  The pop pop fizz fizz.
[01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:02.460]  That one piece of chocolate, not a bar, a piece of chocolate that's 100 milligrams, that's
[01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:03.460]  me all day.
[01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:06.460]  Because I don't want to eat a whole bar and get 100 milligrams.
[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:08.460]  I want to eat 100 milligrams real fast.
[01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:13.460]  I like the exact opposite thing about the 5 milligram gummies because I can sit there
[01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:19.460]  and pop six of them and have that as, like, I'm going to get really toasted dose.
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:22.460]  And I actually get to, like, chew and enjoy the edible.
[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:26.460]  Most of my gripe about edibles is they're delicious, but now they're the size of your,
[01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:27.460]  like, thumb joint.
[01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:31.460]  And you take one tiny little brownie bite and, like, I'm a big guy.
[01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:36.460]  When I take a tiny bite of a brownie, most of the rest of my body that's not chewing
[01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:39.460]  in that moment starts looking for more of that fucking brownie.
[01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:43.460]  And when all of the brownie has wheat in it, that can get dangerous fast.
[01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:49.460]  But, yeah, that's why I like the lower dose stuff because I can have a couple pieces and
[01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:51.460]  enjoy it because most of them are insanely good now.
[01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:53.460]  I've got a new idea for an edible company.
[01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:57.460]  Let's sell, let's just copy our favorite edibles and we'll sell those.
[01:02:57.460 --> 01:03:00.460]  And then right alongside those, we'll sell the same thing without any THC in it.
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:03.460]  It's, people have been joking about it for a minute.
[01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:05.460]  The first company that does it well is going to make a nice thing.
[01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:08.460]  So that you can just eat these and then snack the shit out of these.
[01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:16.070]  Wasn't there a documentary about one THC, Dr. J's or something?
[01:03:16.070 --> 01:03:20.070]  There's more than one company that does a larger piece.
[01:03:20.070 --> 01:03:23.070]  They just don't do it in a multi-pack successfully.
[01:03:24.070 --> 01:03:27.070]  They need to make like a dozen of cookies, right?
[01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:30.070]  And they need to have one packaged in the front of it.
[01:03:30.070 --> 01:03:33.070]  And that one is a hundred milligrams and the rest are none.
[01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:37.070]  And you eat the one and then you can eat the rest of them and it's fine.
[01:03:37.070 --> 01:03:41.070]  Or you shuffle them and set them on the table when company comes over.
[01:03:41.070 --> 01:03:43.070]  Rush it for life, bitches.
[01:03:45.070 --> 01:03:46.070]  That would be a great podcast.
[01:03:46.070 --> 01:03:48.070]  5,000 milligrams.
[01:03:48.070 --> 01:03:49.070]  Put them on this table.
[01:03:49.070 --> 01:03:52.070]  Watch one person just slowly melt out of this.
[01:03:53.070 --> 01:03:55.070]  That would be so funny.
[01:03:55.070 --> 01:03:57.070]  It's not funny to dust people.
[01:03:57.070 --> 01:03:58.070]  Only if everybody knows.
[01:03:58.070 --> 01:03:59.070]  Unless it's Jeff.
[01:03:59.070 --> 01:04:01.070]  Because he's not eating edibles for some reason.
[01:04:01.070 --> 01:04:06.070]  Did you see somebody at the secret stash handed me an edible and I passed it on and they looked completely offended.
[01:04:06.070 --> 01:04:07.070]  I was like, sorry, I'm on a thing.
[01:04:07.070 --> 01:04:08.070]  And they just looked at me like, that's cool.
[01:04:08.070 --> 01:04:09.070]  But I mean, what the fuck?
[01:04:09.070 --> 01:04:11.070]  Why did you give it away instead of giving it back?
[01:04:11.070 --> 01:04:13.070]  Like right in front of the two Jeff.
[01:04:13.070 --> 01:04:14.070]  Damn.
[01:04:14.070 --> 01:04:15.070]  Oh, you give it off?
[01:04:15.070 --> 01:04:16.070]  So you didn't say no.
[01:04:16.070 --> 01:04:17.070]  I didn't realize it.
[01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:19.070]  I grabbed it and I was like, oh, no, wait, shit, I forgot.
[01:04:19.070 --> 01:04:21.070]  Sorry, I'm not doing those drugs anymore.
[01:04:21.070 --> 01:04:22.070]  There you go.
[01:04:24.070 --> 01:04:25.070]  That's funny.
[01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:26.070]  Oh, man.
[01:04:26.070 --> 01:04:27.070]  Yeah.
[01:04:27.070 --> 01:04:29.070]  I'm going to try and get you to get in.
[01:04:29.070 --> 01:04:30.070]  Or eat edibles.
[01:04:30.070 --> 01:04:31.070]  I'll do it again.
[01:04:31.070 --> 01:04:32.070]  I'm just stubborn.
[01:04:32.070 --> 01:04:33.070]  It's funny.
[01:04:33.070 --> 01:04:39.070]  It's more of a joke to me now that I haven't eaten any edibles since that time at secret stash when I ate like 2,500 milligrams.
[01:04:39.070 --> 01:04:42.070]  And then I tried to go to work and I was just fucking.
[01:04:42.070 --> 01:04:44.070]  I always eat too many edibles at secret stash.
[01:04:44.070 --> 01:04:48.070]  And I swear to God, every time we have the conversation, like, we're not going to eat edibles.
[01:04:49.070 --> 01:04:54.070]  And I feel like the last two times you followed through on that, obviously, the last two times I have not.
[01:04:54.070 --> 01:05:01.070]  It was 930 at secret stash and Bobo Blaster Co. Chris bought me a cookie.
[01:05:01.070 --> 01:05:03.070]  I was going to bring this up.
[01:05:03.070 --> 01:05:04.070]  I'm like eating the cookie.
[01:05:04.070 --> 01:05:06.070]  It's like 930 at night.
[01:05:06.070 --> 01:05:08.070]  I have to open the shop the next day.
[01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:11.070]  And the guy was like, I'm eating it.
[01:05:11.070 --> 01:05:14.070]  And he's like, yeah, these cookies were like 300 milligrams.
[01:05:14.070 --> 01:05:15.070]  That's what I've been telling everybody.
[01:05:15.070 --> 01:05:19.070]  He's like, but realistically, they might be like four.
[01:05:19.070 --> 01:05:21.070]  I was like, I'm three-fourths the way through this cookie.
[01:05:21.070 --> 01:05:23.070]  I'm like, I'm going to finish it now.
[01:05:23.070 --> 01:05:27.070]  Because like, it doesn't matter now.
[01:05:27.070 --> 01:05:32.070]  But like, man, I wish I would have known that before I started eating it because I would have only eaten a quarter or half.
[01:05:32.070 --> 01:05:35.070]  That's one of the things I like about the rec market over the med.
[01:05:35.070 --> 01:05:37.070]  And there's not a lot on that list.
[01:05:37.070 --> 01:05:42.070]  But the dosing and the lab testing to perfection.
[01:05:42.070 --> 01:05:44.070]  It's coming to the medical scene very soon.
[01:05:44.070 --> 01:05:48.070]  It'll be there in less than a year probably.
[01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:49.070]  I heard November.
[01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:50.070]  It was supposed to be July.
[01:05:50.070 --> 01:05:51.070]  And then they said November.
[01:05:51.070 --> 01:05:53.070]  We have to build the labs.
[01:05:53.070 --> 01:05:54.070]  Yeah.
[01:05:54.070 --> 01:06:01.070]  We're creating this from the ground up, which is like why we're joking about like different models for edible companies.
[01:06:01.070 --> 01:06:05.070]  We're really watching it happen in front of us.
[01:06:05.070 --> 01:06:06.070]  It's fun.
[01:06:06.070 --> 01:06:14.070]  I had the honor of giving Lindsay and her better half, Mr. Bobo Blastico, a ride home from the secret sesh.
[01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:16.070]  I knew you were going to bring this up.
[01:06:16.070 --> 01:06:18.070]  This little nappy had the back of the car.
[01:06:18.070 --> 01:06:19.070]  There was that lens.
[01:06:19.070 --> 01:06:20.070]  99.
[01:06:20.070 --> 01:06:23.070]  Here's what happened.
[01:06:23.070 --> 01:06:24.070]  First of all, that cookie killed me.
[01:06:24.070 --> 01:06:25.070]  Second of all.
[01:06:25.070 --> 01:06:28.070]  It was the cookie, I swear.
[01:06:28.070 --> 01:06:29.070]  All right.
[01:06:29.070 --> 01:06:31.070]  Jeff wanted to do a podcast on the way home.
[01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:33.070]  And I was totally down to do a podcast.
[01:06:34.070 --> 01:06:36.070]  And then we were all smoking.
[01:06:36.070 --> 01:06:40.070]  And I guess I had said I was going to wait to do a dab.
[01:06:40.070 --> 01:06:42.070]  And I've said no, I don't want to do a dab.
[01:06:42.070 --> 01:06:44.070]  And Chris thought I said that I was going to wait.
[01:06:44.070 --> 01:06:46.070]  So apparently we were all waiting for me to take a dab.
[01:06:46.070 --> 01:06:48.070]  I fell asleep in the back of the car.
[01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:49.070]  And then I woke up.
[01:06:49.070 --> 01:06:52.070]  And I was like, all right, I'm going to keep eating so that I will stay awake.
[01:06:52.070 --> 01:06:54.070]  And then Chris started trolling.
[01:06:54.070 --> 01:06:56.070]  You both started trolling me about how much I was eating in the back of the car.
[01:06:56.070 --> 01:06:57.070]  I was like, fuck this.
[01:06:57.070 --> 01:06:58.070]  I'm going to sleep.
[01:06:58.070 --> 01:06:59.070]  You guys can do your own goddamn podcast.
[01:06:59.070 --> 01:07:00.070]  I thought she was in a sleep.
[01:07:00.070 --> 01:07:01.070]  Chris and I were talking to her.
[01:07:01.070 --> 01:07:02.070]  And she was just blank.
[01:07:02.070 --> 01:07:03.070]  No answer.
[01:07:03.070 --> 01:07:05.070]  And then she goes, why are you guys picking on me?
[01:07:05.070 --> 01:07:07.070]  And we're like, that was like five minutes ago, Lindsay.
[01:07:07.070 --> 01:07:08.070]  Like, what the fuck?
[01:07:08.070 --> 01:07:11.070]  Like, no one has said anything to her for like five minutes.
[01:07:11.070 --> 01:07:13.070]  And she's like, I'm not even asleep.
[01:07:13.070 --> 01:07:14.070]  I was.
[01:07:14.070 --> 01:07:15.070]  Then where is the torch?
[01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:17.070]  And she's like, it's on the floor.
[01:07:20.070 --> 01:07:22.070]  Yeah, I was totally passed out.
[01:07:22.070 --> 01:07:23.070]  She was done back there, yeah.
[01:07:23.070 --> 01:07:24.070]  I know.
[01:07:24.070 --> 01:07:25.070]  But Chris always makes fun of me for sleeping everywhere.
[01:07:25.070 --> 01:07:27.070]  So I always try to be like, I'm not asleep.
[01:07:27.070 --> 01:07:28.070]  Everywhere.
[01:07:28.070 --> 01:07:29.070]  You were asleep.
[01:07:29.070 --> 01:07:30.070]  I was slumped.
[01:07:31.070 --> 01:07:32.070]  Some people can just sleep in the car.
[01:07:32.070 --> 01:07:33.070]  I'm not that person.
[01:07:33.070 --> 01:07:34.070]  That's why I drive everywhere.
[01:07:34.070 --> 01:07:35.070]  I totally am.
[01:07:35.070 --> 01:07:38.070]  Shout out to Dabbing Granny for coming to the secret sesh.
[01:07:38.070 --> 01:07:39.070]  That was so fun.
[01:07:39.070 --> 01:07:40.070]  Dabbing with Dabbing.
[01:07:40.070 --> 01:07:41.070]  She's got so much enthusiasm.
[01:07:41.070 --> 01:07:43.070]  Oh, man.
[01:07:43.070 --> 01:07:44.070]  It just hit me.
[01:07:44.070 --> 01:07:46.070]  Does she wear a shirt that says Dabbing Granny?
[01:07:46.070 --> 01:07:48.070]  She doesn't need a shirt that says Dabbing Granny.
[01:07:48.070 --> 01:07:49.070]  Everybody knows who she is.
[01:07:49.070 --> 01:07:51.070]  Well, that'd make her official, you know what I mean?
[01:07:51.070 --> 01:07:52.070]  Oh, she doesn't even.
[01:07:52.070 --> 01:07:53.070]  I mean, she's got.
[01:07:53.070 --> 01:07:54.070]  It's already there.
[01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:55.070]  She's just her.
[01:07:55.070 --> 01:07:57.070]  She's got more Instagram followers than all of us combined.
[01:07:57.070 --> 01:07:58.070]  Literally.
[01:07:59.070 --> 01:08:02.070]  I think the last time I checked, it was like 156 or 157,000.
[01:08:02.070 --> 01:08:05.070]  I'm trying to process it on Instagram right now.
[01:08:05.070 --> 01:08:07.070]  Nobody follows me at all.
[01:08:07.070 --> 01:08:10.070]  I'm following myself.
[01:08:10.070 --> 01:08:12.070]  I think I'm following myself.
[01:08:12.070 --> 01:08:15.070]  It's funny because I was listening to the last podcast and she was like,
[01:08:15.070 --> 01:08:17.070]  oh, yeah, I just hit 151.
[01:08:17.070 --> 01:08:19.070]  And I was like, damn, I think she's at 157 already.
[01:08:19.070 --> 01:08:20.070]  I was like, damn.
[01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:21.070]  Yeah.
[01:08:21.070 --> 01:08:22.070]  She really gets it going.
[01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:23.070]  I know.
[01:08:23.070 --> 01:08:24.070]  All right.
[01:08:24.070 --> 01:08:25.070]  We've been going for just a little over an hour, you guys.
[01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:27.070]  Jay just said something that made me think about something.
[01:08:27.070 --> 01:08:29.070]  You want more people to follow you on Instagram.
[01:08:29.070 --> 01:08:31.070]  You can tell everybody listening right now how they can stalk you.
[01:08:31.070 --> 01:08:33.070]  Say it right into the top of the mic.
[01:08:33.070 --> 01:08:35.070]  I'm not on Instagram.
[01:08:35.070 --> 01:08:38.070]  Well, I am on Instagram, but I don't have it on my phone.
[01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:39.070]  On social media.
[01:08:39.070 --> 01:08:41.070]  Because I said I was protesting them.
[01:08:41.070 --> 01:08:45.070]  But I do have, I've got Facebook.
[01:08:45.070 --> 01:08:49.070]  Where can anybody stalk you if they want to check you out while they're
[01:08:49.070 --> 01:08:50.070]  listening to your sexy voice?
[01:08:50.070 --> 01:08:54.070]  They can go to, well, my Facebook private.
[01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:55.070]  Hold on a minute.
[01:08:55.070 --> 01:08:59.070]  He's like, I don't have a Twitter.
[01:08:59.070 --> 01:09:00.070]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:09:00.070 --> 01:09:01.070]  Tell them about Twitter.
[01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:04.070]  Let me see what my name is.
[01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:05.070]  Hashtag.
[01:09:05.070 --> 01:09:06.070]  I like it when you ramble.
[01:09:06.070 --> 01:09:07.070]  Yes.
[01:09:07.070 --> 01:09:08.070]  Use the hashtag tweet that Adam guys.
[01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:10.070]  I'm at chicken fish.
[01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:15.070]  C-H-I-C-K-E-N-P-H-I-S-H.
[01:09:15.070 --> 01:09:17.070]  Chicken fish.
[01:09:17.070 --> 01:09:18.070]  I like it.
[01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:19.070]  I like it.
[01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:20.070]  Chicken fish.
[01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:21.070]  Follow him on Twitter.
[01:09:21.070 --> 01:09:22.070]  You guys send him some good stuff.
[01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:23.070]  Hashtag.
[01:09:23.070 --> 01:09:24.070]  I like it when you ramble.
[01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:26.070]  That was my handle when I was driving a truck.
[01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:29.070]  Is that fish with the band fish or just happened to have a PH?
[01:09:29.070 --> 01:09:30.070]  Yeah.
[01:09:30.070 --> 01:09:31.070]  Oh, you're a fish fan?
[01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:32.070]  Yeah.
[01:09:32.070 --> 01:09:33.070]  Oh, why didn't we just start the podcast like that?
[01:09:33.070 --> 01:09:38.070]  Well, you was talking about, I've been to a couple of shows.
[01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:39.070]  All right.
[01:09:39.070 --> 01:09:40.070]  What was your favorite show?
[01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:43.070]  What year, what era?
[01:09:43.070 --> 01:09:48.540]  I just stumped him.
[01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:50.540]  99.
[01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:51.540]  Okay.
[01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:52.540]  That's a good run.
[01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:53.540]  Yeah.
[01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:54.540]  I saw a bunch of 99 shows.
[01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:59.540]  I mean, that really, what was a funny, I've heard of them.
[01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:01.540]  And I knew that down for disease.
[01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:04.540]  So you see what I'm saying?
[01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:05.540]  Swimming around in the fish tank.
[01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:08.540]  But you know, back in the nineties,
[01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:14.540]  I couldn't just go to a torrent site and grab the whole catalog or some
[01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:16.540]  band that I've heard of.
[01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:17.540]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:18.540]  Yeah.
[01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:19.540]  Now it's too easy.
[01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:20.540]  Kids are spoiled nowadays.
[01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:21.540]  My friend won tickets.
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:25.540]  My friend won tickets to the fish show the next day on the radio.
[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:27.540]  He was like the 10th caller or whatever.
[01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:28.540]  And I heard it.
[01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:30.540]  I actually heard it on the radio.
[01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:34.540]  So I went over, we still have pay phones back then.
[01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:37.540]  So what they called him up and said, Hey,
[01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:39.540]  you're taking me to the space concert.
[01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:42.540]  And I put, you know, I said, I know that one song.
[01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:43.540]  I know that one song.
[01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:46.540]  They didn't play it by the way, but I knew that one song.
[01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:49.540]  I was prepared to sing along with them, but they didn't play it.
[01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:51.540]  They didn't play it, but I did play.
[01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:52.540]  I kind of dug.
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:53.540]  You know what I mean?
[01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:56.540]  If you go to see fish, do not expect to hear your favorite song.
[01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:02.540]  Now, after I got into them, I went and seen them again in Charleston,
[01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:06.540]  Virginia, all the way up there.
[01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:11.540]  Not Charleston, Charlottesville where the university of Virginia is.
[01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:12.540]  Okay.
[01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:14.540]  So I'm in there.
[01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:15.540]  This is 10 years later.
[01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:16.540]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:18.540]  And I felt like the old guy, there was,
[01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:22.540]  there was an older couple behind me, but somehow felt older than they was.
[01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:27.540]  And the one thing my wife went with me, went with me this time.
[01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:29.540]  Shout out to you, baby Santana Odell.
[01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:32.540]  Bring her next time.
[01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:33.540]  I will.
[01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:34.540]  I will.
[01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:37.540]  She wanted to come this time, but she had some things she had to do.
[01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:39.540]  That's why it is.
[01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:42.540]  But anyway, I told her about, you know,
[01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:46.540]  soon as I went to the one at Winston Salem,
[01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:50.540]  North Carolina, the first one, soon as the lights went out,
[01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:51.540]  joints lit up everywhere.
[01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:54.540]  And I was like, fuck yeah, my buddy didn't smoke.
[01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:55.540]  But you know what I mean?
[01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:56.540]  I looked over here and I said,
[01:11:56.540 --> 01:11:59.540]  14 year old sitting there fucking cheap.
[01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:00.540]  And I said, yo man, let me hit that.
[01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:03.540]  And he, he gave me the whole joint, fired up another one.
[01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:04.540]  Nice.
[01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:05.540]  Yeah.
[01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:06.540]  It was 14 too.
[01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:07.540]  So I kind of felt obligated.
[01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:09.540]  You know, I was above age.
[01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:12.540]  I wasn't 21, but I was 19, something like that.
[01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:15.540]  I felt obligated to tell you from a 14 year old.
[01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:16.540]  He had smoked a runner.
[01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:17.540]  That's what you got to do.
[01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:18.540]  He pulled out another one.
[01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:19.540]  So he had me trunk.
[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:21.540]  My buddy didn't smoke.
[01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:22.540]  So he wouldn't let me bring no weed.
[01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:24.540]  But anyway, I come prepared the second time.
[01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:27.540]  And I told my wife, I'm like, soon as these lines go out,
[01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:28.540]  you about to see something.
[01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:32.540]  You see all the joints fired up and she's like, oh yeah,
[01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:33.540]  I can dig this.
[01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:36.540]  And you know, seeing all the people dancing around.
[01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:37.540]  I told her all about that.
[01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:38.540]  She tripped out.
[01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:39.540]  I'd love to go see him again.
[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:40.540]  Out here.
[01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:42.540]  They'll be here this weekend.
[01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:45.540]  I'm doing my best.
[01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:46.540]  Doing my best.
[01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:47.540]  People say yes.
[01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:48.540]  Yeah.
[01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:49.540]  It's sold the fuck out.
[01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:50.540]  Yeah.
[01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:52.540]  If you got a lot of money, you're going to have too much damn money.
[01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:53.540]  How much?
[01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:55.540]  Like a eight package.
[01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:57.540]  I mean, get a huge package.
[01:12:57.540 --> 01:13:00.540]  You're probably looking close to 200 bucks one night per person.
[01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:01.540]  And they're doing three nights.
[01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:03.540]  He just put his head down and defeat.
[01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:04.540]  Just here.
[01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:07.540]  No, they'll come once a year.
[01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:09.540]  Oh, my bad.
[01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:10.540]  They come once a year.
[01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:11.540]  Okay.
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:12.540]  Yeah.
[01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:13.540]  They come to Colorado once a year.
[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:14.540]  I wish they usually had dicks.
[01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:15.540]  Yeah.
[01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:16.540]  That's where they're at this year.
[01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:17.540]  The giant soccer field, bro.
[01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:19.540]  They sell out that giant soccer field three nights in a row.
[01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:20.540]  Welcome.
[01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:21.540]  Three nights.
[01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:22.540]  Yeah.
[01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:23.540]  Never miss a Sunday show.
[01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:24.540]  That's my advice.
[01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:25.540]  This podcast will come out the Monday after.
[01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:27.540]  So, and while you guys are listening to this,
[01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:29.540]  I'm probably hanging out with Doug Benson.
[01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:30.540]  I'm going to see Doug Benson.
[01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:31.540]  Thursday.
[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:32.540]  I got the Jeff Tate thing.
[01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:34.540]  Friday, Saturday, Sunday is fish at Dick's.
[01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:35.540]  And then I'm going to see the,
[01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:37.540]  Monday, Saturday, Sunday is fish at Dick's.
[01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:39.540]  And then Monday, Doug Benson at comedy works.
[01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:41.540]  So, probably taking a dab.
[01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:42.540]  I sure will.
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:44.540]  I'll dab him out for you.
[01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:45.540]  Yeah.
[01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:46.540]  Doug's my homie.
[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:47.540]  After the show.
[01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:48.540]  Yeah, after the show.
[01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:49.540]  I fucked him up one time.
[01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:50.540]  He called me out on stage.
[01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:51.540]  He looked at me.
[01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:52.540]  He's like, you got me too high, Rasta Jeff.
[01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:54.540]  Like, everyone laughed at me.
[01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:55.540]  Like, I really did.
[01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:56.540]  I kind of wrecked him a little bit.
[01:13:56.540 --> 01:13:57.540]  It was fun.
[01:13:57.540 --> 01:13:58.540]  That's funny.
[01:13:58.540 --> 01:13:59.540]  Yeah.
[01:13:59.540 --> 01:14:00.540]  That's cool.
[01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:01.540]  That's a lot of fun.
[01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:02.540]  Holy crap.
[01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:03.540]  Excuse my coughs.
[01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:08.540]  Also, Sizzla Kalonji at Cervantes, September 19th.
[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:09.540]  That's going to be a fun one.
[01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:11.540]  Yeah, if you're a Rasta, if you're into that reggae.
[01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:12.540]  Colorado's getting awesome.
[01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:13.540]  It's just continuous now.
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:14.540]  I've never seen Sizzla.
[01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:15.540]  I'm pretty excited for that one.
[01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:19.540]  I remember a time here when you had a few good concerts at the beginning of the summer
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:21.540]  and a few good concerts at the end.
[01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:23.540]  And that was it.
[01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:28.540]  There was no concerts during the not beginning or end of summer.
[01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:31.540]  If it wasn't those two, like, three-week sections of time,
[01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:33.540]  there wasn't anything going on.
[01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:37.540]  The Dirty Fish Kid and me used to just pack up the car and go where the concerts were.
[01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:39.540]  Yeah, but now it's continuous here.
[01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:40.540]  We've always got something going on.
[01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:42.540]  Have you ever been to Telluride?
[01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:46.540]  You know, I've been to almost everything but the Telluride Blues Fest and the Bluegrass Fest.
[01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:47.540]  Yeah, I've never done that one.
[01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:50.540]  Yeah, I'm up there, like, every other Friday, man.
[01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:51.540]  Damn.
[01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:52.540]  They always got something going on up there.
[01:14:52.540 --> 01:14:53.540]  Yeah.
[01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:54.540]  Always.
[01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:55.540]  Yeah, that little mountain town stays busy.
[01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:56.540]  That little mountain town is awesome.
[01:14:56.540 --> 01:14:57.540]  Yeah.
[01:14:57.540 --> 01:14:58.540]  I mean, just the view.
[01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:00.540]  I've been up there once, and it was an amazing time.
[01:15:00.540 --> 01:15:06.540]  I would play lottery just to win something so I could buy a house up there and just tell everybody to fuck off.
[01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:12.540]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, if you've got an extra house in Telluride and you're cool as fuck and you're tired of it,
[01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:14.540]  my buddy Juicy J will trade you.
[01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:19.540]  He's got two packs of free rolls and a spot exit bag.
[01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:21.540]  You know what? I think we could donate pretty much.
[01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:22.540]  I got a gram.
[01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:23.540]  I'll throw one gram of hash in.
[01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:24.540]  We'll donate what's on the table.
[01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:25.540]  All he wants to do.
[01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:26.540]  We'll give him the whole table.
[01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:27.540]  Give him the whole table.
[01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:28.540]  Yeah, my man, whole table.
[01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:29.540]  Everything on the table.
[01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:30.540]  You can have it.
[01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:31.540]  The email can go, too.
[01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:33.540]  If we get Juicy J a spot up in Telluride so that he can get the fuck out.
[01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:34.540]  Everything on the table.
[01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:35.540]  Linz just picked up her phone.
[01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:36.540]  It's got to have five rooms.
[01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:37.540]  Five rooms in Telluride.
[01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:38.540]  Five bedrooms.
[01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:39.540]  Anyone looking to donate.
[01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:42.540]  Because everybody's going to want to come and visit with me.
[01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:43.540]  Yeah.
[01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:44.540]  I can rent one room out, too.
[01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:46.540]  I can get behind this dream.
[01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:47.540]  Send me an email.
[01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:49.540]  Girlfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:52.540]  We'd love to take your offers for free housing in Telluride.
[01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:53.540]  That'd be great.
[01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:58.540]  There's a bunch of spots in Colorado like that that are just kind of awesome now.
[01:15:58.540 --> 01:15:59.540]  Oh, yeah.
[01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:01.540]  They used to be very much seasonal.
[01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:03.540]  It's a good thing.
[01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:05.540]  You think people will just give you a house?
[01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:06.540]  You think that'll work?
[01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:07.540]  Maybe.
[01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:08.540]  That'd be cool.
[01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:09.540]  The strangest things have happened this week.
[01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:10.540]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:11.540]  That is true.
[01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:12.540]  I'm wondering.
[01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:14.540]  I can go on Twitter and see my sexy body.
[01:16:14.540 --> 01:16:16.540]  If you weren't married, I was going to be like, we need the sugar mama.
[01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:18.540]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:20.540]  She is my sugar mama.
[01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:21.540]  There you go.
[01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:22.540]  All right.
[01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:23.540]  It's time for you to do your plugs.
[01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:27.540]  Tell all the people that are still listening how they can find you on all the social media.
[01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:32.540]  So, my Instagram and my Periscope are the traveling stoner.
[01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:34.540]  Wow, I almost fucked that up.
[01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:37.540]  Did you just say LOL out loud?
[01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:39.540]  Yeah, I say that all the time, actually.
[01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:43.540]  So, my Instagram, my Periscope are the traveling stoner.
[01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:46.540]  My Twitter is the travel stoner.
[01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:49.540]  My Snapchat is traveling stoner without the G.
[01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:51.540]  I think it's everything, actually.
[01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:52.540]  Where do you go?
[01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:53.540]  I'm sorry?
[01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:54.540]  Where do you go?
[01:16:54.540 --> 01:16:56.540]  Oh, where do I go?
[01:16:56.540 --> 01:17:01.540]  Well, I actually started out in Jersey and moved down to Florida.
[01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:05.540]  I'm out here in Colorado, and I kind of just travel everywhere all the time.
[01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:06.540]  How many states have you been in?
[01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:08.540]  How many states have I actually been in?
[01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:13.540]  Oh, man, I haven't actually done a count since I came out and everything.
[01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:15.540]  I'd have to do a recount and think about it.
[01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:17.540]  I've smoked a joint in 48 states.
[01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:18.540]  Yeah.
[01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:19.540]  Hell yeah.
[01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:20.540]  That's impressive.
[01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:21.540]  That is impressive, ish.
[01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:22.540]  Very respectable.
[01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:26.540]  And I've even snuck over into Mexico, but that's probably for a later podcast.
[01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:27.540]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:28.540]  That's pretty long.
[01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:29.540]  You're going to be back.
[01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:34.540]  Yeah, but anyway, I've smoked a joint in Mexico, snuck over in a limousine,
[01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:36.540]  smoked a joint in Mexico.
[01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:38.540]  So, Alaska.
[01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:39.540]  Allegedly?
[01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:40.540]  In a limousine?
[01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:41.540]  Can you say snuck?
[01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:45.540]  Ha ha ha ha ha.
[01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:49.540]  Would going further be a bad legal choice?
[01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:50.540]  Would what?
[01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:51.540]  Allegedly.
[01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:52.540]  Mike.
[01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:53.540]  Allegedly.
[01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:55.540]  No, I just love that part of the story.
[01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:58.540]  I heard snuck and then I heard limousine and I just smiled really big.
[01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:00.540]  Mike just makes that up because he's like, literally.
[01:18:00.540 --> 01:18:01.540]  I fucking love it.
[01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:02.540]  Mike kind of follows the rules.
[01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:03.540]  Oh, yeah.
[01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:04.540]  When you do bad shit.
[01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:05.540]  What?
[01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:06.540]  I don't want to get you in trouble.
[01:18:06.540 --> 01:18:07.540]  No.
[01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:09.540]  Like on the one hand, I don't want to get you in trouble, but on the other hand,
[01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:11.540]  I really want to hear the rest of that story.
[01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:14.540]  Well, like I said, it's a pretty long story.
[01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:15.540]  That'll be part two.
[01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:16.540]  We'll do that.
[01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:17.540]  We'll do that in the next episode for sure.
[01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:22.540]  I want to make sure everybody's cool with it because it gets pretty vulgar at times.
[01:18:22.540 --> 01:18:23.540]  I'm in.
[01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:26.540]  We can handle this at a later episode.
[01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:27.540]  I love it.
[01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:28.540]  It's a whole other show.
[01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:29.540]  Okay.
[01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:32.540]  It just got jotted down so the odds of it happening just went up to like 65%.
[01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:33.540]  Yep.
[01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:34.540]  Yep.
[01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:35.540]  Right.
[01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:36.540]  It's going to be a future episode.
[01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:37.540]  Ha ha ha ha.
[01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:39.540]  Sorry, I was laughing too hard.
[01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:40.540]  You're 65.
[01:18:40.540 --> 01:18:44.540]  I do want to give a big shout out though to like in the past couple of weeks,
[01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:48.540]  I've been on the podcast a lot these past couple months actually.
[01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:49.540]  Thank you for that.
[01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:54.540]  And I have had a lot of people message me about the podcast and say,
[01:18:54.540 --> 01:18:58.540]  you know, great podcast, you know, listen to it this morning, loved it.
[01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:01.540]  Like the day it drops, like by 7 a.m.
[01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:04.540]  there's usually one person that has messaged me and said,
[01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:05.540]  already listened to it.
[01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:06.540]  It sounds great.
[01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:09.540]  So I just want to give a big shout out to everybody that has been listening
[01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:11.540]  and messaging me to say that the podcast has been great.
[01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:12.540]  That's awesome.
[01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:14.540]  Thank you, Lins, for supporting the show.
[01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:17.540]  Since you and Granny and Brett have been on the show frequently,
[01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:19.540]  the listens have gone up.
[01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:22.540]  My Instagram and Twitter followers have gone up on all of the accounts,
[01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:25.540]  the Rasta Jeff, the iRegenetics, and the GFYH account.
[01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:27.540]  So thanks for participating.
[01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:29.540]  Your social media skills are fucking awesome.
[01:19:29.540 --> 01:19:30.540]  Thank you.
[01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:31.540]  So yeah, you're killing it there.
[01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:36.540]  Thanks to all those people that message Lindsay and don't message me for some
[01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:37.540]  reason.
[01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:41.540]  Big thanks to all you guys for listening to the show and participating with
[01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:42.540]  Lins.
[01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:43.540]  That's really cool.
[01:19:43.540 --> 01:19:44.540]  I get so many messages.
[01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:45.540]  Just keep messaging her.
[01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:46.540]  That's cool.
[01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:47.540]  If you want to send me a message, I'd appreciate it.
[01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:51.540]  And I owe a huge shout out to that one mountain girl.
[01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:56.540]  She messages me and tells me how great the episode is before I wake up.
[01:19:56.540 --> 01:19:57.540]  Yeah.
[01:19:57.540 --> 01:19:58.540]  So that's awesome.
[01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:00.540]  She Snapchats it almost every Monday morning.
[01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:03.540]  It's like getting ready and it's like the girl from the heart.
[01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:04.540]  You can hear it in the background.
[01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:06.540]  She'll be in the bathtub or she'll be taking her morning dabs or on her
[01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:07.540]  morning hike or whatever.
[01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:08.540]  Yeah.
[01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:09.540]  Love you, girl.
[01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:10.540]  It's on Snapchat.
[01:20:10.540 --> 01:20:11.540]  Her name's that one mountain girl.
[01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:12.540]  That one mountain girl.
[01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:15.540]  I think her Snapchat is mountain smokes.
[01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:16.540]  It is.
[01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:17.540]  That's why I couldn't find her today.
[01:20:17.540 --> 01:20:18.540]  Yes.
[01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:20.540]  And then her Instagram is that one mountain girl.
[01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:21.540]  But shout out to you, girl.
[01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:23.540]  I hope you're doing good in Washington.
[01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:24.540]  Yes.
[01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:25.540]  I love it.
[01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:26.540]  Shout out.
[01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:27.540]  Thanks for supporting the show.
[01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:28.540]  Yeah.
[01:20:28.540 --> 01:20:29.540]  Everybody, if you're listening to the show,
[01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:31.540]  we've been going for an hour and 18 minutes.
[01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:32.540]  That means with the intro I put on this,
[01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:34.540]  we're probably about an hour and 20 minutes ish.
[01:20:34.540 --> 01:20:36.540]  So I love all the people that listen this far.
[01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:37.540]  We really appreciate it.
[01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:39.540]  Thanks for hanging out at the table with us and for watching.
[01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:40.540]  Thanks for hanging out at the table with us.
[01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:41.540]  It feels like you're here.
[01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:44.540]  I put new light bulbs in the chandelier and it's all bright and shiny in here.
[01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:45.540]  It's like a whole new place.
[01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:46.540]  It's amazing.
[01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:47.540]  It woke up the conversation.
[01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:49.540]  It made everybody a little more talkative.
[01:20:49.540 --> 01:20:50.540]  This is a great show.
[01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:51.540]  Yeah.
[01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:52.540]  I want to thank everybody for listening.
[01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:53.540]  I want to thank Mike for coming,
[01:20:53.540 --> 01:20:54.540]  taking time away from his dinner,
[01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:56.540]  his wife and his baby and his pack of dogs.
[01:20:56.540 --> 01:20:58.540]  Thanks for coming and hanging out.
[01:20:58.540 --> 01:21:00.540]  Tracey J, thanks for joining us on the podcast.
[01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:01.540]  Was this your first podcast ever?
[01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:02.540]  Yeah.
[01:21:02.540 --> 01:21:03.540]  This is going to be a regular thing, bro,
[01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:04.540]  because you got good stories.
[01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:05.540]  You got a good vibe.
[01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:06.540]  You're going to be here often taking dabs at this.
[01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:07.540]  All right.
[01:21:07.540 --> 01:21:08.540]  Yeah.
[01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:09.540]  Bring your wife next time.
[01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:10.540]  Your wife's kind of a local celebrity I hear.
[01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:11.540]  Yeah, kind of.
[01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:12.540]  Good.
[01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:13.540]  I think she's a celebrity.
[01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:14.540]  I was about to show her.
[01:21:14.540 --> 01:21:15.540]  Should I edit that out?
[01:21:15.540 --> 01:21:16.540]  No.
[01:21:16.540 --> 01:21:17.540]  No.
[01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:18.540]  What a rock.

[01:21:25.540 --> 01:21:26.540]  but you've taken off,
[01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:27.540]  you've taken new ventures in life,
[01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:28.540]  and I wish you nothing but the best.
[01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:29.540]  Thank you.
[01:21:29.540 --> 01:21:30.540]  Thank you.

[01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:41.540]  buddy.
[01:21:41.540 --> 01:21:42.540]  I hope that works for you.
[01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:43.540]  You guys,
[01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:44.540]  we're going to wrap up this portion of the show.
[01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:45.540]  Shout out to the people that are in the room that don't have
[01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:46.540]  microphones.
[01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:47.540]  I've just been hanging out smoking blunts with us and taking
[01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:48.540]  dabs.
[01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:50.540]  I'm going to wrap up this portion of the show and of course,
[01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:54.540]  I'll be right back to put a tail on this fishy.
[01:21:54.540 --> 01:21:55.540]  Did I really just say,
[01:21:55.540 --> 01:21:56.540]  put a tail on this fish?
[01:21:56.540 --> 01:21:57.540]  That was fucking weird.
[01:21:57.540 --> 01:21:58.540]  You guys,
[01:21:58.540 --> 01:21:59.540]  thanks for listening to the podcast.
[01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:01.540]  I truly appreciate all of the support you guys,

[01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:16.180]  Thanks to everybody that was in the room smoking blunts and having a good time
[01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:18.460]  with those people were taking dabs and smoking blunts off Mike.
[01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:20.260]  It's kind of fun having extra people in the room.
[01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:22.140]  Kept it a little chaotic, kept things moving.
[01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:24.020]  Uh, I'm going to get off the microphone and quit talking.
[01:22:24.020 --> 01:22:25.740]  It's been like an hour and 20 minute podcast.
[01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:29.700]  So, uh, catch me in about seven days and until next time, take a fat dad
[01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:31.500]  and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:37.540]  Yeah.

[01:26:47.220 --> 01:26:50.700]  new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist, even

[01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:07.460]  Big shout out to Kat.
[01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:14.060]  Ladies and gentlemen, in this episode, we're going to talk a little bit about
[01:27:14.060 --> 01:27:16.060]  re-vegging and reverting your plants.
[01:27:16.380 --> 01:27:19.060]  Uh, some people like to take their plants all the way through the flowering
[01:27:19.060 --> 01:27:23.100]  phase and then return them back to veg and reuse those same plants.
[01:27:23.100 --> 01:27:25.940]  So we will talk a little bit about that later in this episode.
[01:27:26.220 --> 01:27:29.260]  Before I get that far, I want to talk about some cool shit that I got to do this week.
[01:27:29.260 --> 01:27:30.980]  I kind of tease this on a past episode.
[01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:35.060]  I got to take a good friend up to Colorado Springs on Thursday and we saw
[01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:39.260]  Jeff Tate, Emma Arnold, and some other opening comedians, my friend, Ben Verbeck
[01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:41.180]  was an opening comedian up at the dab lounge.
[01:27:41.180 --> 01:27:43.460]  They did their good cop, bad cop comedy show.
[01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:44.700]  It was a great time.
[01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:46.980]  I got to hang out with Jeff Tate and Emma Arnold, and
[01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:48.420]  they treated me like a rockstar.
[01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:50.340]  I've seen Jeff Tate several times.
[01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:52.060]  That was my first time meeting Emma Arnold.
[01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:54.820]  I've seen Jeff Tate several times with Doug Benson.
[01:27:55.260 --> 01:27:57.580]  Uh, so him and I have become comfortable with each other.
[01:27:57.580 --> 01:28:00.140]  He has recently become a pot smoker.
[01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:02.340]  He has made the switch from alcohol to cannabis.
[01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:03.660]  So excited about that.
[01:28:04.140 --> 01:28:06.420]  I got to see Jeff Tate, Emma Arnold do some comedy.
[01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:09.700]  Uh, Ben Verbeck opened the show.
[01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:11.540]  Another guy whose name has left my head.
[01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:12.660]  I knew his name until right now.
[01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:13.740]  That guy went on second.
[01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:17.980]  Uh, and then Emma Arnold went on and her set was great.
[01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:21.780]  Then Jeff Tate went on, he did a comedy set and then toward the end of his
[01:28:21.780 --> 01:28:26.020]  standup routine, he said, I'm going to light this joint and start smoking.
[01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:28.740]  And at some point in this comedy show, I'm going to become too
[01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:31.140]  high to continue doing standup.
[01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:33.660]  And so he lit his joint and he kept doing his bit.
[01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:36.740]  And then at some point he obviously got too high and he said,
[01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:37.900]  thanks and walked off the stage.
[01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:38.700]  That was pretty cool to see.
[01:28:38.700 --> 01:28:39.500]  It was fun to watch.
[01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:40.580]  That was a good experience.
[01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:44.060]  Uh, Friday I took the night off, got some rest, hung out a little bit.
[01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:48.820]  Saturday and Sunday we went to Denver and I saw my favorite band.
[01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:49.940]  My favorite band is Fish.
[01:28:49.940 --> 01:28:54.900]  I saw Fish at the Dick's sporting goods arena stadium, whatever it is, a gigantic,
[01:28:54.900 --> 01:28:57.300]  big ass soccer field, saw Fish there.
[01:28:57.700 --> 01:28:58.660]  Uh, it was sold out.
[01:28:58.660 --> 01:28:59.860]  All three nights were sold out.
[01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:02.100]  If you did not have tickets, it was a challenge getting tickets.
[01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:03.380]  I'm lucky I got into that one.
[01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:05.980]  Uh, man, Fish was awesome.
[01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:07.660]  Played some of my favorite songs.
[01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:10.180]  They played a really amazing version of a song called maze.
[01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:13.020]  Uh, they played tube, played some great, great music.
[01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:13.940]  We had a great time.
[01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:15.580]  Really good show.
[01:29:16.220 --> 01:29:16.700]  A good time.
[01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:17.500]  Amazing evening.
[01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:20.540]  Safe drive, which was great because it was a busy holiday weekend.
[01:29:20.900 --> 01:29:23.580]  Uh, Monday morning, uh, we had backup to Denver.
[01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:27.940]  We get some food up in Denver and then we got to see Doug Benson at the comedy works.
[01:29:28.420 --> 01:29:32.140]  Uh, one of my favorite podcasts is the Doug loves movies podcast.
[01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:36.460]  And I got to see Doug Benson, uh, joined once again by his friends, Jeff Tate and
[01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:41.260]  Emma Arnold, and also a guy named Trey Galleon joined them, uh, for the Doug loves
[01:29:41.260 --> 01:29:43.340]  movies, taping at comedy works.
[01:29:43.340 --> 01:29:44.820]  And of course I got to hang out for that one.
[01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:45.780]  I was front row.
[01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:49.180]  Uh, big shout out to my buddy Baker for getting me front row all
[01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:50.140]  the time at comedy works.
[01:29:50.140 --> 01:29:50.980]  I appreciate that.
[01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:53.380]  Uh, it was a great taping you guys.
[01:29:53.380 --> 01:29:58.260]  I suggest that you listen to the Denver, uh, show of Doug loves movies.
[01:29:58.260 --> 01:30:00.940]  It is out now by the time this podcast comes out, that will be out.
[01:30:00.940 --> 01:30:01.860]  Make sure you check it out.
[01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:03.020]  That's a great podcast.
[01:30:03.020 --> 01:30:03.900]  Doug loves movies.
[01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:07.220]  If you're listening to this podcast, you have access to Doug loves movies.
[01:30:07.380 --> 01:30:07.780]  Check it out.
[01:30:07.780 --> 01:30:08.700]  It's one of my favorite shows.
[01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:09.780]  I can see live taping.
[01:30:11.220 --> 01:30:13.460]  Great time at the end of the podcast taping.
[01:30:13.460 --> 01:30:16.700]  We're all hanging outside in the alley smoking because Doug and his friends
[01:30:16.700 --> 01:30:18.460]  love to come and just smoke out with everybody.
[01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:22.380]  I made friends with Trey Galleon almost instantly, like instantly
[01:30:22.420 --> 01:30:23.620]  that guy and I are homies.
[01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:24.780]  Now we'll be friends for life.
[01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:28.420]  Uh, before I left all four of the comedians were standing there and I
[01:30:28.420 --> 01:30:30.740]  said, Hey, you guys, it means a lot to me that you come and do comedy.
[01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:32.060]  Cause comedy is super important to me.
[01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:33.220]  So like, thank you guys.
[01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:36.100]  And they all like sincerely felt my thanks.
[01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:37.940]  So that was kind of cool to see all four of their faces.
[01:30:37.940 --> 01:30:39.420]  Like, Holy shit, we made this dude's day.
[01:30:39.940 --> 01:30:40.460]  That was pretty cool.
[01:30:40.460 --> 01:30:41.300]  So that was my weekend.
[01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:43.380]  You guys, I got a bunch of good comedy, a whole bunch
[01:30:43.380 --> 01:30:43.980]  of good music.
[01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:45.380]  Once again, shout out to my buddy Baker.
[01:30:45.700 --> 01:30:47.740]  Shout out to Ben Verbeck from the dab lounge.
[01:30:47.740 --> 01:30:49.780]  Shout out to the dab lounge in Colorado Springs.
[01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:54.860]  Big, huge shout outs to Emma Arnold, Jeff Tate, Trey Galleon, Doug Benson,
[01:30:54.860 --> 01:30:56.860]  and everyone at comedy works.
[01:30:56.860 --> 01:31:00.140]  Also shout out to fish and my fish and buddies.
[01:31:00.180 --> 01:31:00.740]  That was fun.
[01:31:00.820 --> 01:31:01.460]  I appreciate that.
[01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:04.860]  So, um, where are we going to go from here?
[01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:05.820]  Let's talk about a grow update.
[01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:06.940]  I've got a grow update.
[01:31:06.940 --> 01:31:09.340]  Everybody that's been listening to the show knows that I've been
[01:31:09.340 --> 01:31:10.780]  working on a breeding project.
[01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:13.860]  I've got one light with a very small breeding project happening in there.
[01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:17.020]  Uh, the other day I went in there and pulled out the male plant.
[01:31:17.020 --> 01:31:18.820]  I collected a little bit of pollen from him.
[01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:20.380]  Then I cut the plant down.
[01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:23.260]  And of course I hosed myself down with a good shower because I don't
[01:31:23.260 --> 01:31:24.460]  want to get that pollen everywhere.
[01:31:24.780 --> 01:31:26.460]  So now the male plant is out of the room.
[01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:27.980]  I had one arise male.
[01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:32.260]  That plant has dropped his pollen and he is now gone.
[01:31:32.700 --> 01:31:35.380]  There are five arise female types.
[01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:39.620]  There are a number two, number four, no, it's number four, number five,
[01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:41.140]  number seven, number eight.
[01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:43.180]  And then one that was labeled E.
[01:31:43.260 --> 01:31:47.860]  E was the remaining phenotype from another pheno hunt that I liked a lot.
[01:31:47.860 --> 01:31:49.100]  E has been around for a minute.
[01:31:49.100 --> 01:31:51.140]  E is the arise that you see a lot of pictures of.
[01:31:51.660 --> 01:31:55.140]  The other ones are really good competitors that have great traits.
[01:31:55.540 --> 01:31:57.860]  So I've got those five female phenotypes in there.
[01:31:57.860 --> 01:32:01.620]  I have one golden goat, one grateful dog, one lemon skunk.
[01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:03.300]  All of those are females in there.
[01:32:04.140 --> 01:32:07.580]  So there are eight females that have all been pollinated by this one male.
[01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:10.180]  They are currently 40 days into flower.
[01:32:10.620 --> 01:32:13.300]  It's been about 25 days since pollination.
[01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:17.380]  I've still got probably 20 to 30 days before I can harvest these
[01:32:17.380 --> 01:32:18.740]  plants and the seeds will be ready.
[01:32:19.420 --> 01:32:21.700]  Currently the seeds are visible.
[01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:24.300]  You can see that the pollen worked.
[01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:26.940]  These plants took the pollen.
[01:32:26.940 --> 01:32:27.860]  They're seeded now.
[01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:29.300]  They're developing nicely.
[01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:32.340]  I kind of like to see what's going on.
[01:32:32.340 --> 01:32:34.380]  So the other day I grabbed a bottom bud and just pinched
[01:32:34.380 --> 01:32:35.260]  one of the seeds out of it.
[01:32:35.420 --> 01:32:39.500]  They're white still, but they are starting to develop an embryo inside.
[01:32:39.540 --> 01:32:42.220]  The shells are getting a little bit hard, but they are still white.
[01:32:42.620 --> 01:32:46.060]  They taste weird also, if you're curious, but they're not quite ready yet.
[01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:47.140]  So we've got a little ways to go.
[01:32:47.980 --> 01:32:51.820]  So when they're ready, my plan is to let them go until those seeds are really
[01:32:51.820 --> 01:32:55.660]  well done, and then I'm going to cut down each plant and label each plant
[01:32:55.660 --> 01:32:57.180]  very carefully as to what it is.
[01:32:57.460 --> 01:33:00.780]  And I will hang each plant in its own area with a bowl underneath it.
[01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:02.740]  So that if a seed does fall out, I'll catch it.
[01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:03.980]  Actually, you guys, I'm a drummer.
[01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:05.140]  I'm going to use a drum head.
[01:33:05.660 --> 01:33:09.460]  Put the drum head upside down, put it underneath each plant so that if a seed
[01:33:09.460 --> 01:33:10.660]  falls out, it lands in the drum head.
[01:33:10.660 --> 01:33:11.540]  It doesn't go anywhere.
[01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:16.500]  Then once they dry, I will take each plant individually and crush it up
[01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:18.340]  into probably a Tupperware dish.
[01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:21.100]  And just like, I'll take off the fan leaves and I'll crunch it up.
[01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:22.660]  All the buds will get just like hand ground.
[01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:25.100]  Like I'm going to roll joints and then I'll just, all the seeds
[01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:25.980]  will fall out at that point.
[01:33:25.980 --> 01:33:26.900]  I'll pull out all the seeds.
[01:33:27.380 --> 01:33:28.100]  I'll separate them.
[01:33:28.100 --> 01:33:28.700]  I'll jar them up.
[01:33:28.700 --> 01:33:33.700]  I'll label them as to which phenotype that is like a rise F2.
[01:33:33.740 --> 01:33:37.300]  Like it will be a rise five F2, a rise seven F2, whatever planet comes
[01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:38.340]  from, I'll make sure it's labeled.
[01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:40.180]  And then I'm going to grow a bunch of those.
[01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:41.740]  And some of my friends are going to grow a bunch of those.
[01:33:41.740 --> 01:33:44.700]  And I'm going to see which arise phenotypes I want to continue breeding with.
[01:33:45.340 --> 01:33:48.140]  And then we'll see if this golden goat, the grateful dog and lemon skunk,
[01:33:48.180 --> 01:33:49.100]  we'll see if they do anything.
[01:33:49.100 --> 01:33:49.860]  So that's my goal.
[01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:51.260]  I want to make some new stuff.
[01:33:51.260 --> 01:33:53.020]  I want to stabilize this arise a little bit.
[01:33:53.020 --> 01:33:57.740]  My goal is actually in the long run to take this arise all the way to F5.
[01:33:58.060 --> 01:33:59.060]  That's what I would like to do.
[01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:02.540]  That will take me a couple of years, probably two more years, maybe three
[01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:05.260]  more years to get it there, depending on how selection goes, depending on how
[01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:09.740]  stubborn I am, depending on what the F2s and F3s show me.
[01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:10.340]  All right.
[01:34:10.340 --> 01:34:11.740]  So that's my breeding update, you guys.
[01:34:12.020 --> 01:34:14.380]  I appreciate you guys sticking around for the breeding updates with me.
[01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:17.580]  If you have any questions on my breeding project, please send me an email.
[01:34:17.580 --> 01:34:19.340]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:34:19.380 --> 01:34:23.460]  I would love to answer your questions about my breeding project.
[01:34:24.300 --> 01:34:24.740]  All right.
[01:34:24.780 --> 01:34:28.980]  So let's get into some listener emails and this will segue me into the reverting
[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:31.780]  and revegging topic that I teased about at the top of the show.
[01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:34.100]  We've got a bunch of great messages.
[01:34:34.100 --> 01:34:38.180]  This one came on Instagram and this was actually, this guy had no idea that I was
[01:34:38.180 --> 01:34:39.900]  going to use this as podcast content.
[01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:42.540]  This was a personal conversation between him and I.
[01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:45.260]  I don't know if he wants me to say his name on the show.
[01:34:46.060 --> 01:34:49.580]  So we're just going to call this the seeded herb question, email number one.
[01:34:50.740 --> 01:34:51.980]  This guy says, quick question.
[01:34:51.980 --> 01:34:55.380]  I pulled off almost all the fan leaves on an early flowering strawberry
[01:34:55.380 --> 01:34:57.300]  cough plant from Saga Martha seeds.
[01:34:57.620 --> 01:34:59.380]  This was at five to six weeks ago.
[01:34:59.740 --> 01:35:04.780]  I guess the strawberry cough plant threw bananas before I saw them because I have
[01:35:04.780 --> 01:35:07.140]  seeds and all the plants fully mature now.
[01:35:07.180 --> 01:35:11.380]  And the only plant that had bananas was the strawberry cough.
[01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:16.820]  So when he says he saw bananas, he means that he saw male flowers
[01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:20.580]  developing on his female plants, which means that this female was actually
[01:35:20.580 --> 01:35:27.940]  a hermaphrodite or, or it was stressed and it caused it to panic and cause male
[01:35:27.980 --> 01:35:32.580]  flowers so that it could try to keep itself alive by making more seeds and
[01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:34.140]  then continuing its generations.
[01:35:35.180 --> 01:35:36.700]  So he continues with another message.
[01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:41.260]  He says, will these banana pollen seeds make mostly plants that have a tendency
[01:35:41.260 --> 01:35:45.300]  to toss bananas easily or at the end?
[01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:47.140]  That's a really good question.
[01:35:47.180 --> 01:35:53.700]  See, the thing is, the main thing here, we don't know why that strawberry cough
[01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:56.100]  plant threw those bananas.
[01:35:56.100 --> 01:35:58.020]  We don't know why it hermaphrodited out on you.
[01:35:58.020 --> 01:35:59.180]  We don't know if it's a herm.
[01:35:59.260 --> 01:36:01.140]  We don't know if it's got herm traits in it.
[01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:02.980]  We don't know if it's one of its parents was a herm.
[01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:05.100]  We don't know if that specific phenotype is a herm.
[01:36:05.820 --> 01:36:08.060]  We don't know why that plant threw bananas.
[01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:09.580]  It could have been stressed.
[01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:12.780]  Things that would have caused it to throw bananas would have been a light leak.
[01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:17.420]  If that plant, some things I've seen, a light comes in through your ducting, you
[01:36:17.420 --> 01:36:19.500]  guys, you're ducting those hooded lights.
[01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:22.420]  You've got ducting running, you're running it out the window or wherever.
[01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:26.260]  Light comes reflecting into that and the plant that is right underneath that
[01:36:26.260 --> 01:36:30.300]  reflector, I've seen those hermaphrodite because they are getting hit with light
[01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:30.780]  leaks.
[01:36:31.260 --> 01:36:34.900]  Another thing that could cause that plant to hermaphrodite could be heat stress.
[01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:36.860]  Another thing could be over-nutrienting it.
[01:36:37.340 --> 01:36:40.540]  Too much nitrogen toward the end of flower could absolutely cause a plant
[01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:42.140]  to become a hermaphrodite.
[01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:44.100]  Too dry, too moist.
[01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:47.860]  Any kind of weird interruption on some strains can cause them to herm.
[01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:51.540]  Now, the main question is, did that plant herm because it's a hermaphrodite
[01:36:51.540 --> 01:36:53.620]  itself or was it an environmental factor?
[01:36:53.620 --> 01:36:54.500]  Either way, it's herming.
[01:36:55.060 --> 01:36:56.580]  That's not something that's going to hermaphrodite on you.
[01:36:56.580 --> 01:36:58.260]  That's not something I would keep in my garden.
[01:36:58.300 --> 01:36:59.820]  I would go ahead and get rid of that one.
[01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:01.860]  Let's talk about the seeds that come out of there.
[01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:03.700]  I also have something else to mention.
[01:37:03.940 --> 01:37:07.020]  You said that every plant that is now mature has seeds in it.
[01:37:07.300 --> 01:37:09.900]  That makes me think that you could have a light leak in there and all of those
[01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:14.660]  plants all produce seeds because of light stress and only that strawberry cough
[01:37:14.900 --> 01:37:18.900]  showed the hermaphrodite flowers just because that's a phenotypical thing.
[01:37:18.940 --> 01:37:21.780]  The other ones may not have shown you the hermaphrodite flowers, but they could have
[01:37:21.780 --> 01:37:25.820]  seeded on their own just from being stressed, even if you didn't see flowers
[01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:29.180]  in there and maybe that strawberry cough is the only one that you actually noticed
[01:37:29.580 --> 01:37:31.700]  the flowers, maybe it produced them to where you could see them.
[01:37:32.060 --> 01:37:33.100]  That's just a possibility.
[01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:33.860]  Also, you're right.
[01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:39.060]  That all could have been seeded by that rogue hermaphrodite strawberry cough.
[01:37:39.540 --> 01:37:42.300]  If that strawberry cough was a hermaphrodite, you may have created some
[01:37:42.300 --> 01:37:45.340]  seeds that may grow some great phenotypes, but you may also run
[01:37:45.340 --> 01:37:46.940]  into a bunch of hermaphrodites.
[01:37:47.580 --> 01:37:50.740]  The same thing could be true if you got your seeds from stressing those
[01:37:50.740 --> 01:37:54.660]  plants from light stress or from overfeeding or from underfeeding
[01:37:54.660 --> 01:37:56.580]  or for overwatering, whatever caused that.
[01:37:56.860 --> 01:37:59.260]  You may have produced some amazing progeny.
[01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:02.060]  You also may have produced a bunch of hermaphrodites.
[01:38:02.420 --> 01:38:06.180]  My main piece of advice is don't share those seeds with anybody until
[01:38:06.180 --> 01:38:07.820]  you've ran a bunch of them yourself.
[01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:10.860]  And when you do give them out, make sure people know that they do have a
[01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:14.980]  tendency or at least a likelihood to have some hermaphrodite traits in there
[01:38:15.220 --> 01:38:18.340]  because we don't want people wasting their time growing herms when they
[01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:19.820]  could be growing quality stuff.
[01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:23.060]  And the guy that sent me this message, you have produced some quality stuff.
[01:38:23.060 --> 01:38:24.540]  So let's just stick to that.
[01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:26.300]  You guys, my throat's burning out for a second.
[01:38:26.460 --> 01:38:27.620]  I obviously need a quick drink.
[01:38:27.820 --> 01:38:28.380]  I'll be right back.
[01:38:28.900 --> 01:38:29.980]  All right, you guys, I am back.
[01:38:29.980 --> 01:38:33.100]  While I was taking a drink and a couple of dabs, something dawned on me.
[01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:36.980]  Our listener in his message said that his plant was an early
[01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:38.580]  flowering strawberry cough plant.
[01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:41.500]  Now that phrase early flowering indicates a couple of things to me.
[01:38:41.900 --> 01:38:45.340]  I wonder if that plant flowered more quickly than the other plants.
[01:38:45.340 --> 01:38:48.460]  Like, did it show flowers at like day 10 when the other plants
[01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:50.340]  waited until day 14 or 15?
[01:38:50.660 --> 01:38:54.340]  Or did it flower on its own while it was in under veg lights,
[01:38:54.340 --> 01:38:55.980]  under 18 or 24 hours of light?
[01:38:55.980 --> 01:38:59.380]  I'm not sure what you mean by early flowering, but that says something to me.
[01:38:59.660 --> 01:39:03.140]  A plant that wants to auto flower like that is probably a hermaphrodite.
[01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:07.300]  The reason it's trying to flower early is because a male plant wants
[01:39:07.300 --> 01:39:08.940]  to get up above the female plants.
[01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:10.020]  It grows a little taller.
[01:39:10.540 --> 01:39:13.340]  It wants to get up above the female plants and it wants to start dropping
[01:39:13.340 --> 01:39:17.660]  pollen so that it's already spitting out pollen by the time those females are ready.
[01:39:17.980 --> 01:39:20.900]  The cannabis plant's whole goal in life is to reproduce.
[01:39:21.140 --> 01:39:23.740]  So that plant is probably a hermaphrodite.
[01:39:23.980 --> 01:39:25.420]  It wants to get taller than everybody.
[01:39:25.420 --> 01:39:26.580]  It wants to flower first.
[01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:30.380]  It wants to have pollen falling before all of those females are ready
[01:39:30.380 --> 01:39:31.660]  so that it's ready for the party.
[01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:33.060]  It's over there at the party set up.
[01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:34.140]  It's already got a beer in hand.
[01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:35.660]  It's just waiting for the chicks to show up.
[01:39:35.980 --> 01:39:39.700]  So I would not use that plant for growing or breeding anymore.
[01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:43.420]  The seeds that you made are probably produced from a hermaphrodite plant.
[01:39:43.420 --> 01:39:47.660]  You're going to see some hermaphroditic tendencies in that progeny.
[01:39:47.860 --> 01:39:49.220]  I wouldn't give those out to anybody.
[01:39:49.220 --> 01:39:52.020]  I would grow those myself and pay very close attention
[01:39:52.340 --> 01:39:54.740]  to what happens to those plants.
[01:39:55.020 --> 01:39:55.340]  All right.
[01:39:55.580 --> 01:39:56.540]  Dude, thanks for the message.
[01:39:56.540 --> 01:39:58.540]  If you ever have any more questions, send them to me.
[01:39:58.540 --> 01:40:01.940]  I will use more of your stuff on the podcast because you have some great
[01:40:02.020 --> 01:40:04.860]  questions because you're an advanced grower and I like where you're going.
[01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:06.020]  Keep up the good work.
[01:40:06.260 --> 01:40:06.780]  Shout out.
[01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:07.860]  You're doing a good job.
[01:40:07.900 --> 01:40:09.860]  I won't say your name on the show, but you know who I'm talking to.
[01:40:10.580 --> 01:40:10.900]  All right.
[01:40:10.900 --> 01:40:12.380]  That brings us to our next email.
[01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:13.900]  This is a little bit of an update.
[01:40:13.940 --> 01:40:16.940]  A few episodes ago, I was sent an email about monster cropping.
[01:40:17.260 --> 01:40:20.060]  And I told the dude that I wasn't sure what he meant about monster cropping
[01:40:20.060 --> 01:40:22.620]  because when I Googled it, there were a ton of different options.
[01:40:22.820 --> 01:40:24.300]  So I asked him for more information.
[01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:25.300]  He has replied.
[01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:26.100]  This is what he said.
[01:40:26.100 --> 01:40:29.740]  He said, Hey bro, when I was asking about monster cropping, I was meaning
[01:40:29.740 --> 01:40:33.420]  when you take a cut off a female plant, that's about three weeks in bloom and
[01:40:33.420 --> 01:40:37.820]  re-veg her, I had a buddy telling me about this last week, he says that
[01:40:37.820 --> 01:40:42.380]  the clone goes crazy making shoots and there's no need to top her.
[01:40:42.700 --> 01:40:45.820]  So I'm assuming you were re-vegging the clone that you're taking and you were
[01:40:45.820 --> 01:40:47.740]  letting that plant flower and finish out.
[01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:50.020]  Uh, that sounds like a decent idea.
[01:40:50.020 --> 01:40:53.020]  If you're taking that clone from near the bottom of the plant, if you're not
[01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:56.500]  taking it off of the top, because you don't want to disrupt the flowering tops.
[01:40:57.100 --> 01:41:00.180]  Um, it kind of seems like it, it's a good idea.
[01:41:00.180 --> 01:41:03.380]  It kind of also seems like it could be a waste of time and the amount of time
[01:41:03.660 --> 01:41:05.620]  you've got to plant it's three weeks into flower, it's already
[01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:06.740]  starting to show little buds.
[01:41:06.780 --> 01:41:08.180]  It's already in flower.
[01:41:08.180 --> 01:41:09.380]  The hormones have converted.
[01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:10.780]  It wants to make buds.
[01:41:11.300 --> 01:41:15.060]  Now you need to take that clone and get it in the cloner or how in the dome,
[01:41:15.060 --> 01:41:18.580]  however you do it, it needs to be under 24 hours of light and you have to revert
[01:41:18.580 --> 01:41:22.900]  that plant all the way back to a vegetative state, then you have to veg it
[01:41:22.900 --> 01:41:27.620]  to the size that you need it and then you can flower it, it seems like it takes a
[01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:30.940]  long time and honestly, I wouldn't even flower out that plant.
[01:41:30.980 --> 01:41:34.380]  I would take clones once it started getting healthy and re-vegging
[01:41:34.380 --> 01:41:35.900]  and spitting out proper shoots.
[01:41:35.900 --> 01:41:38.540]  I would take clones of that and turn those clones into a
[01:41:38.540 --> 01:41:41.060]  mother plant and then start over.
[01:41:41.540 --> 01:41:45.340]  So it kind of seems like a lot of work for just a plant with some
[01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:47.140]  extra shoots to tell you the truth.
[01:41:47.140 --> 01:41:50.900]  You could pro in the amount of time that you're re-vegging to develop those
[01:41:50.900 --> 01:41:52.660]  shoots to re-veg it, to get it healthy.
[01:41:52.660 --> 01:41:57.020]  I could probably just cut another clone and make a happy plant by topping and
[01:41:57.020 --> 01:42:00.420]  shaping and pruning and making the plant the size and shape I wanted it to be.
[01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:02.500]  It seems like kind of a waste of time.
[01:42:02.620 --> 01:42:05.820]  In my opinion, I'm not going to knock anybody's method because
[01:42:05.820 --> 01:42:07.180]  they may have a purpose for this.
[01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:08.340]  It may be working for them.
[01:42:08.660 --> 01:42:09.220]  That's great.
[01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:12.700]  But I bet you in the amount of time you're spending re-vegging, I could
[01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:18.260]  probably just cut clones and do things the simple way, top it, train it, get it going.
[01:42:18.580 --> 01:42:19.420]  So it's a great message.
[01:42:19.460 --> 01:42:21.420]  I'm glad you told me what monster cropping is.
[01:42:21.420 --> 01:42:22.220]  I've never tried that.
[01:42:22.220 --> 01:42:24.820]  If anybody else out there has tried monster cropping, send me a message.
[01:42:25.060 --> 01:42:25.980]  Send me some pictures.
[01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:27.460]  Let me know more info about it.
[01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:28.620]  Let me know how it goes for you.
[01:42:28.940 --> 01:42:29.340]  It's easy.
[01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:31.020]  Growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:42:31.060 --> 01:42:32.460]  I would love to hear from you.
[01:42:32.940 --> 01:42:34.260]  So we've been talking about re-vegging.
[01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:37.100]  I did kind of bash it and say that it's sort of a waste of time, but there are
[01:42:37.100 --> 01:42:40.700]  times when re-vegging is a very useful application.
[01:42:41.420 --> 01:42:42.380]  There are reasons to do it.
[01:42:42.380 --> 01:42:43.780]  Maybe you forgot to take a clone.
[01:42:43.780 --> 01:42:46.900]  I always talk about when you grow from seed, make sure you take clones
[01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:48.860]  because you may grow the best shit you've ever grown.
[01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:51.260]  And if you don't have a clone, you're going to be angry.
[01:42:51.460 --> 01:42:55.140]  So if you didn't take a clone of that plant, re-vegging is always an option.
[01:42:55.540 --> 01:42:56.540]  Or maybe you're like me.
[01:42:56.580 --> 01:42:59.340]  Maybe you did take a shit ton of clones and maybe you fucked up
[01:42:59.340 --> 01:43:00.940]  and maybe all your clones died.
[01:43:00.940 --> 01:43:02.620]  So now you don't have any clones of that strain.
[01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:03.820]  That has happened to me before.
[01:43:04.140 --> 01:43:05.140]  That shit does happen.
[01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:08.980]  Or maybe you're even more like me and my friend, Colin, maybe you grow too many
[01:43:08.980 --> 01:43:12.460]  seeds and you don't even have any room left to take more clones, so your only
[01:43:12.460 --> 01:43:14.220]  option is to revert those plants.
[01:43:14.420 --> 01:43:15.780]  So there are reasons why.
[01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:17.980]  So let's talk a little bit about re-vegging.
[01:43:17.980 --> 01:43:21.420]  Re-vegging is actually when you have flowered out a cannabis plant and you
[01:43:21.420 --> 01:43:25.260]  want to return it back to its vegetative state so you can start fresh.
[01:43:25.540 --> 01:43:29.460]  Now, like I said before, I would return that plant back to a veg state and I
[01:43:29.460 --> 01:43:33.140]  would take clones from it and then use those clones as my new mother plants.
[01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:34.780]  I wouldn't try to flower that one back out.
[01:43:35.060 --> 01:43:37.540]  It feels to me like you would just kind of wear that plant out.
[01:43:37.780 --> 01:43:39.820]  You can do it, but it's going to stress that plant out.
[01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:41.780]  It's probably going to get weaker as it goes.
[01:43:42.300 --> 01:43:43.820]  I can't guarantee that, but I wouldn't do it.
[01:43:43.820 --> 01:43:46.220]  I would take, I would re-veg it and then try to take a clone.
[01:43:46.260 --> 01:43:47.500]  This is like your second chance.
[01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:49.100]  So hopefully your clones live this time.
[01:43:49.100 --> 01:43:50.180]  Hopefully you don't kill them all.
[01:43:50.420 --> 01:43:51.620]  Hopefully you remember to take them.
[01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:53.500]  So you're going to re-veg your plant.
[01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:57.940]  Something really helpful that will really speed up your re-vegging process.
[01:43:57.940 --> 01:44:00.500]  And this sounds crazy, but this will work.
[01:44:01.340 --> 01:44:06.820]  When you begin to flush approximately 10 to 14 days before harvest time, I fully
[01:44:06.820 --> 01:44:11.540]  recommend that you turn your lights back on to 18-6.
[01:44:11.580 --> 01:44:11.940]  That's right.
[01:44:11.940 --> 01:44:13.060]  No more 12-12.
[01:44:13.260 --> 01:44:19.940]  We want them on for 18 hours and off for six hours a day for the last 10 to 14
[01:44:19.940 --> 01:44:22.940]  days of your flowering cycle.
[01:44:22.940 --> 01:44:26.220]  So while you're flushing, change the timer back to 18-6.
[01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:27.020]  This isn't enough.
[01:44:27.540 --> 01:44:32.180]  That two week period isn't enough time to revert those plants back to veg since
[01:44:32.180 --> 01:44:34.020]  they are so far along in flower.
[01:44:34.220 --> 01:44:36.580]  And you may see some of the buds start to try to revert.
[01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:37.580]  Just harvest.
[01:44:37.580 --> 01:44:38.020]  You're cool.
[01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:38.740]  It's time.
[01:44:39.180 --> 01:44:39.700]  Just do that.
[01:44:39.700 --> 01:44:40.580]  It's harvest time anyway.
[01:44:40.580 --> 01:44:41.620]  You're cutting those plants down.
[01:44:41.620 --> 01:44:42.060]  It's cool.
[01:44:42.460 --> 01:44:47.860]  So about 10 to 14 days before harvest time, put your timer back on to 18-6.
[01:44:47.860 --> 01:44:48.980]  That is your veg schedule.
[01:44:48.980 --> 01:44:49.980]  Put it back on there.
[01:44:50.420 --> 01:44:52.940]  That'll get the plant sped up back into the re-veg phase.
[01:44:53.340 --> 01:44:54.180]  Let them finish.
[01:44:54.700 --> 01:44:55.580]  Cut your plants down.
[01:44:55.620 --> 01:44:59.580]  When you're harvesting, leave the bottom three buds on the
[01:44:59.580 --> 01:45:00.940]  bottom branches of your plant.
[01:45:01.260 --> 01:45:04.940]  So if you've got a single stock plant, if you did not top, if you've got a
[01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:08.140]  plant with one stock coming up, there's a little intersection where
[01:45:08.140 --> 01:45:09.180]  it makes a peace sign, right?
[01:45:09.180 --> 01:45:10.420]  You got the main stock going up.
[01:45:10.420 --> 01:45:11.700]  You got a branch coming off the left.
[01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:13.020]  You got a branch coming off the right.
[01:45:13.740 --> 01:45:16.700]  Up the left branch and up the right branch, there will be little buds.
[01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:18.460]  Leave those buds.
[01:45:18.820 --> 01:45:22.580]  You want to leave the bottom three buds on those bottom branches.
[01:45:22.860 --> 01:45:26.660]  So from the bottom of the plant up, find the bottom ones and then go one, two,
[01:45:26.660 --> 01:45:31.260]  three, leave those three buds and harvest everything else on the bottom two branches.
[01:45:31.260 --> 01:45:33.860]  If you topped it, you've got four branches on those bottom four,
[01:45:33.860 --> 01:45:35.220]  leave the bottom three buds.
[01:45:35.660 --> 01:45:39.260]  That's what you're going to revert into a vegetative plant and start over.
[01:45:39.460 --> 01:45:43.660]  So once you've harvested the plant, move it to a room with 24 hours of light.
[01:45:43.660 --> 01:45:47.980]  You can either use a T5, you can use a metal halide, or you can use an LED.
[01:45:48.180 --> 01:45:51.820]  The more light you use, the more quickly your plant will return back
[01:45:51.820 --> 01:45:56.100]  to a vegetative stage and you can start taking clones from it and then use one
[01:45:56.100 --> 01:45:59.860]  of those clones as a new mother plant, veg that one out and then take clones
[01:45:59.860 --> 01:46:02.580]  from that and those clones can be your next crop.
[01:46:02.580 --> 01:46:05.780]  I feel like you've now solved the problem of a flowering plant.
[01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:06.820]  You've fixed the hormones.
[01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:09.180]  You've gotten it back to the way it should be as a vegetative plant.
[01:46:09.180 --> 01:46:10.860]  And you were right back where you began.
[01:46:11.380 --> 01:46:14.460]  One thing I should mention is while you're waiting for your plant to revert,
[01:46:14.780 --> 01:46:18.620]  you should feed it with a kelp and vegetative nutrients.
[01:46:18.620 --> 01:46:20.100]  Just use your basic veg nudes.
[01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:23.420]  More nitrogen will help speed up the process, but don't overdo it.
[01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:27.620]  Now, if you want to speed up this process, there is one thing that you can do.
[01:46:27.940 --> 01:46:34.700]  You can add 200 particles per million of GA3, that's gibberellic acid, to your feed
[01:46:34.700 --> 01:46:37.620]  and it will really speed up the reverting process.
[01:46:37.900 --> 01:46:43.740]  What this will do, now earlier I talked about taking that flowering plant and
[01:46:43.740 --> 01:46:47.860]  reverting it back to veg and then taking a clone from that and using that clone as
[01:46:47.860 --> 01:46:50.340]  your new mother and then cutting clones from that one.
[01:46:50.540 --> 01:46:53.900]  If you use the gibberellic acid, I feel like you can take that plant that was
[01:46:53.900 --> 01:46:58.220]  flowering and you can revert it and then take clones from it and those clones will
[01:46:58.220 --> 01:47:00.140]  be completely fine to work with.
[01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:03.460]  Keep one of those as your mother plant, flower out the rest of them and you were
[01:47:03.460 --> 01:47:06.940]  back on track with vegetative plants and a mother.
[01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:08.260]  You did not lose your strain.
[01:47:08.700 --> 01:47:10.140]  Now you can grow that strain forever.
[01:47:10.180 --> 01:47:11.020]  You can keep it around.
[01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:12.900]  Make sure you take clones from here on out.
[01:47:14.020 --> 01:47:15.020]  And that's how you do reveging.
[01:47:15.020 --> 01:47:16.340]  Guys, I hope you learned a lot from that.
[01:47:16.420 --> 01:47:19.260]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend Colin from the Ethos Collective.
[01:47:19.260 --> 01:47:20.900]  Make sure you support the Ethos Collective.
[01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:22.340]  They're a seed company in Colorado.
[01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:24.540]  I strongly endorse that brand.
[01:47:24.540 --> 01:47:25.820]  Colin knows what he's talking about.
[01:47:25.820 --> 01:47:26.740]  He knows what he's doing.
[01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:28.420]  Big shout out, much respect.
[01:47:28.820 --> 01:47:30.220]  Guys, I want to thank you for the emails.

[01:48:29.580 --> 01:48:31.100]  I look forward to your rating.
[01:48:31.380 --> 01:48:35.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, I think that's all I have got for you for this week.
[01:48:35.340 --> 01:48:36.700]  I will see you in seven days.
[01:48:36.700 --> 01:48:40.260]  The next episode will feature Mike and we're going to talk about CBD.
[01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:42.500]  I hope you'll join us for that conversation.
[01:48:42.820 --> 01:48:43.620]  That's all I've got for you.
[01:48:43.620 --> 01:48:45.140]  So a big shout out to my ninja spins.
[01:48:45.180 --> 01:48:46.180]  Thanks again for listening.
[01:48:46.180 --> 01:48:49.620]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:16.080]  Yeah.
[01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:17.400]  Welcome back cannabis community.
[01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:21.000]  It's time for episode number 153 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:24.320]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[01:54:24.840 --> 01:54:25.080]  That's right.
[01:54:25.080 --> 01:54:27.200]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a
[01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:30.760]  new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even
[01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:34.040]  someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis, this, my
[01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:36.160]  friends is the podcast for you.
[01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:37.320]  I'm your host.
[01:54:37.320 --> 01:54:38.520]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:41.000]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me as always.
[01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:42.200]  I need to send a huge thank you.
[01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:44.440]  Shout out to my friends in the mystic roots band for letting
[01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:46.120]  me use their music on my podcast.
[01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:49.880]  Big thanks to Kat, Koot and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:54:51.080 --> 01:54:53.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, this episode, I'm joined by white Mike
[01:54:53.560 --> 01:54:55.800]  and we talk a lot about CBD.
[01:54:56.480 --> 01:54:58.880]  The episode was kind of long, so I'm not going to waste a lot of time.
[01:54:58.880 --> 01:54:59.920]  I'm going to let the music play.
[01:55:00.680 --> 01:55:03.480]  And when we get back, Mike and I will be at the dab table.
[01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:04.200]  Hang out with us.
[01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:08.120]  I just now did.
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:09.440]  So you seriously aren't going to cough.
[01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:10.560]  That was all I got from you.
[01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:11.160]  Oh, there it is.
[01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:11.600]  All right.
[01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:14.920]  I knew you were going to cough a little bit for me.
[01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:16.800]  We'll just get some things set up here.
[01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:18.200]  Get the settings all accurate.
[01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:19.240]  So that sounds real good.
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:20.360]  I might've been good.
[01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:21.280]  Had you not mentioned something.
[01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:22.920]  I'm coughing too.
[01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:23.280]  Don't worry.
[01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:27.240]  The, I just got a pretty funny text message.
[01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:29.800]  Now they may hear the air conditioner in the back just
[01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:30.840]  because of what I got set up.
[01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:31.360]  That's all right.
[01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:32.320]  Oh, there's some headphones.
[01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:34.000]  Yeah.
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:34.280]  Go ahead.
[01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:35.200]  What's up everybody?
[01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:35.920]  How you doing Mike?
[01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:37.000]  I'm doing good.
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:40.440]  Can you bring headphones down just a touch, man?
[01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:43.360]  There we go.
[01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:44.400]  Oh, bam.
[01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:45.320]  No, that's a little low.
[01:55:45.320 --> 01:55:45.800]  There you go.
[01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:46.920]  There's now we're touching.
[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:47.840]  That thing is touching.
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:49.840]  Doing good, man.
[01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:51.360]  Good.
[01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:51.600]  Good.
[01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:53.160]  Needed a couple of days.
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:56.520]  And I think we got there.
[01:55:57.400 --> 01:55:57.640]  Me too.
[01:55:57.640 --> 01:55:59.720]  I'm trying not to cough into the microphone, getting everything set up here.
[01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:01.120]  I think we're ready to do a podcast.
[01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:02.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're just going to go from here.
[01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:05.880]  See backs and tray table smokes in the upright position.
[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:07.400]  Nobody's in any upright position here.
[01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:08.440]  No, no, no.
[01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:10.200]  Kick it back and drop that tray.
[01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:11.360]  It's time for podcasts.
[01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:12.000]  Get comfy.
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:12.880]  That's funny shit.
[01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:15.040]  Get your work tools out.
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:16.960]  If you're listening to work and get your groove on.
[01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:19.840]  What I want to just talk about first is everyone's talking about
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:22.440]  this honey bee thing on Facebook.
[01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:24.160]  I've seen that a couple of spots.
[01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:28.960]  People are claiming that this dude in France is, has trained his honey bees
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:33.160]  to make THC laden honey by collecting.
[01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:35.680]  THC from cannabis plants.
[01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:40.560]  Now I'm not a bee expert, but I don't think that's how this works.
[01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:45.400]  Uh, I I'm here to say that I don't think that this is real.
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:46.880]  I think it's bullshit to tell you the truth.
[01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:50.680]  I, uh, when I first saw it online, I was like, oh, that's really cool.
[01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:51.440]  I want to get weight.
[01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:53.600]  Bees collect pollen.
[01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:54.120]  Yes.
[01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:56.240]  Tricombs collect pollen.
[01:56:56.680 --> 01:56:57.080]  Yeah.
[01:56:57.360 --> 01:56:59.000]  They are not themselves.
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:03.720]  Well, uh, the pistols collect the pollen to be more, to be more accurate, but the
[01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:07.000]  pollen is actually used as a defense against insects.
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:12.080]  Uh, and they do show pictures of bees on the cannabis, on the female cannabis
[01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:18.200]  plants and what, uh, somebody says in one of these debunking websites, because I
[01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:22.120]  did do research before I came on, on a podcast and said that it was bullshit.
[01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:24.080]  I did do some research to back myself up.
[01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:27.960]  They claimed that they just simply sprayed sugar water on the budding female
[01:57:27.960 --> 01:57:30.240]  plants to encourage those bees to land there.
[01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:31.260]  Yes.
[01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:33.560]  Maybe a little bit of THC will stick to those bees.
[01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:35.240]  So is this a marketing ploy for homies honey?
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:36.120]  I think so.
[01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:36.620]  Yeah.
[01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:39.080]  So in his video, they do show male plants.
[01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:39.900]  Yeah.
[01:57:39.900 --> 01:57:43.240]  So what I think may be happening, and I'm going to back up a little bit.
[01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:47.600]  This guy says he's getting THC honey from cannabis plants.
[01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:48.680]  He can be doing that.
[01:57:48.680 --> 01:57:50.480]  He may be, that's totally a thing.
[01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:52.600]  It's just not going to be psychoactive, right?
[01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:55.240]  He may be getting pollen from male cannabis plants.
[01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:56.680]  Those bees are gathering that pollen.
[01:57:56.920 --> 01:57:58.700]  They're flying back to their hive.
[01:57:58.700 --> 01:58:01.720]  They're putting that pollen in the little thing that they put in a little honeycomb.
[01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:03.320]  And then they, uh, they actually.
[01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:07.840]  Bees actually chew up the pollen in their mouths and they regurgitate it.
[01:58:08.160 --> 01:58:12.960]  And something in the regurgitation creates the nectar to turn into honey.
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.360]  So this is why I don't like knowing how everything's made.
[01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:16.020]  Yes.
[01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:17.160]  Nature is fucking gross.
[01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:18.080]  I really liked honey.
[01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:21.200]  Now I'm going to have to try to not think about the fact that it's bee vomit.
[01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:22.640]  Yeah. It's straight up bee puke.
[01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:24.720]  So bees, your pukes pretty tasty.
[01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:25.380]  Yeah.
[01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:27.560]  And it's got some really cool medicinal effects.
[01:58:27.560 --> 01:58:28.880]  Your pukes way better than mine, bro.
[01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:31.600]  So they're so gross.
[01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:33.800]  Uh, side note, side note, totally random side note.
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:37.840]  Jelly belly has created some new flavors and one of their new flavors is vomit.
[01:58:38.160 --> 01:58:39.320]  Oh, bad jelly belly.
[01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:40.080]  Yeah. Right.
[01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:40.680]  Who wants it?
[01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:42.320]  Vomit flavored jelly belly.
[01:58:42.360 --> 01:58:43.160]  That's not funny.
[01:58:43.480 --> 01:58:46.760]  So these, these flies, these bees are going and they're
[01:58:46.800 --> 01:58:49.720]  collecting, they could be collecting the male pollen from these male plants and
[01:58:49.720 --> 01:58:51.600]  flying back and creating honey out of that.
[01:58:51.600 --> 01:58:52.880]  That is very feasible.
[01:58:53.320 --> 01:58:57.960]  I do not see how they could land on a female cannabis plant with trichomes on
[01:58:57.960 --> 01:59:02.000]  it and gather trichomes and fly enough trichomes back to the hive to make
[01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:02.640]  cannabis honey.
[01:59:02.640 --> 01:59:03.960]  That doesn't seem feasible to me.
[01:59:04.440 --> 01:59:07.800]  Uh, well, I don't see them purposefully gathering the trichomes either.
[01:59:07.800 --> 01:59:11.280]  So any sort of trichome gathering is going to be incidental or accidental.
[01:59:11.320 --> 01:59:12.080]  Yeah, completely.
[01:59:12.080 --> 01:59:15.800]  And I think that it's probably, have you ever been trimming and rub your eye?
[01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:16.880]  Super.
[01:59:16.920 --> 01:59:17.200]  Yeah.
[01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:17.840]  Don't do that.
[01:59:17.880 --> 01:59:18.520]  It burns.
[01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:21.920]  We've spent like the first half hour at any new trim gig warning the dude, the
[01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:23.080]  new people not to do that.
[01:59:23.120 --> 01:59:23.320]  Right.
[01:59:23.320 --> 01:59:24.000]  And somebody will do it.
[01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:24.960]  Somebody will rub their eye.
[01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:26.120]  Every time it happens.
[01:59:26.160 --> 01:59:29.320]  It's the, the, the plant gives off pheromones.
[01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:32.880]  Sometimes people have allergy style reactions to it.
[01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:35.200]  And sometimes your face gets itchy when you're trimming.
[01:59:35.280 --> 01:59:35.960]  That's just the thing.
[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000]  And so you rub your eye and it burns.
[01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:38.160]  Yeah.
[01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:39.280]  You only make that mistake once.
[01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:41.240]  It's like getting maced and it sucks.
[01:59:41.240 --> 01:59:43.480]  You can't make it quit because your fingers are sticky because you're
[01:59:43.480 --> 01:59:45.200]  trimming, so you got to deal with it.
[01:59:45.480 --> 01:59:50.440]  I think that the pH was far too hot for these bees to be able to handle it.
[01:59:50.440 --> 01:59:51.520]  I think it would burn the bees.
[01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:53.240]  I think they would just be like, nah, fuck this.
[01:59:53.240 --> 01:59:54.440]  I don't want anything to do with it.
[01:59:54.680 --> 01:59:58.400]  See, I don't know if it would be too acidic or to like burn them, but I think
[01:59:58.400 --> 02:00:01.320]  that the stickiness of the tackiness would annoy the shit out of them.
[02:00:01.320 --> 02:00:04.280]  That's definitely part of what the trichome is designed to do.
[02:00:04.280 --> 02:00:07.120]  It's to partially to keep those bugs away from there.
[02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:12.640]  So, so I could see this totally be like, there, there may be serious benefits to
[02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:17.120]  bees collecting male cannabis, pollen, and turning that into honey, but it's
[02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:21.000]  definitely not like weed honey is as advertised, right?
[02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:22.720]  It's a very cool marketing ploy.
[02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:26.200]  It is a very cool video, but I think, uh, it is inaccurate.
[02:00:26.200 --> 02:00:29.480]  I think it's misleading and I don't think you're getting THC honey.
[02:00:29.480 --> 02:00:31.240]  I, I want to see this happen.
[02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:32.000]  You know what I mean?
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.360]  I want it to be, uh, somebody said earlier, they ain't going
[02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:35.400]  to do it on the honor system.
[02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:38.480]  I want to watch them, uh, make this honey.
[02:00:38.520 --> 02:00:40.560]  And then I want to watch the bees do their thing.
[02:00:40.600 --> 02:00:44.320]  But I want to gather the honey and then I want to take that honey to a lab and let
[02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:47.560]  steep Hill test that honey for me and see what type of cannabinoids are in there.
[02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:50.200]  Well, that's what I was thinking when we were kind of talking about this before
[02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:54.120]  the show is for that to happen, we would have to bring this little homie to
[02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:59.720]  Colorado with his bees and his cannabis plants, because that's the only place
[02:00:59.720 --> 02:01:02.840]  on the planet where we could really collect and lab test that in a controlled
[02:01:02.840 --> 02:01:06.360]  way without him going to jail immediately after I think he can do it in Spain.
[02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:10.240]  May and he's in France, so he's just a border jump boy.
[02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:12.440]  I think Spain's grow home, grow.
[02:01:12.520 --> 02:01:14.160]  I haven't looked at him for a minute.
[02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:17.520]  I don't think Spain cares because they have Spanibus and there's a hillside in Spain.
[02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:18.520]  I forget the name of the place.
[02:01:18.760 --> 02:01:21.800]  I feel bad that I can't remember the name of the region, but there's a small region
[02:01:21.800 --> 02:01:23.880]  in Spain where they do not care about cannabis growing.
[02:01:23.880 --> 02:01:25.080]  There are a lot of people go there.
[02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:29.040]  They, uh, they might have the ability to grow, but do they have the access to
[02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:31.440]  the same testing kind of labs that we do?
[02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:32.600]  That's a very good question.
[02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:35.760]  Because both in the same area are, are one of the things that make
[02:01:35.760 --> 02:01:37.760]  Colorado's cannabis market so awesome.
[02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:41.560]  Dude, come to Colorado, bring your bees, bring your, bring your gear.
[02:01:42.120 --> 02:01:42.840]  We'll do what we got to do.
[02:01:42.840 --> 02:01:43.920]  We want to see this happen.
[02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:47.760]  We want to test your B you've heard about a dude in a, on a mildly related
[02:01:47.760 --> 02:01:49.920]  note, the dude in Oregon that's doing the hogs.
[02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:55.560]  No, he, uh, um, you know how here the waste from the cannabis grow, you have
[02:01:55.560 --> 02:01:59.440]  to do specific stuff with it so it doesn't end up in teenagers hands or
[02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:00.400]  whatever, out of your dumpster.
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:03.920]  We ground up into little tiny pieces, run through a wood chipper and
[02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:05.280]  then mixed with other product.
[02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:05.640]  Right.
[02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:11.240]  A shop up in Oregon, um, hog found a hog farmer to take care of a farm.
[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:11.840]  Perfect.
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:16.040]  Um, and so they take all that plant material and, uh, I, I'm not exactly
[02:02:16.040 --> 02:02:19.000]  sure what he, what the farmer does to it between picking it up from the
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.960]  shop and dropping it off with the pigs, but I'm assuming it's not much.
[02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:26.560]  Um, and they chow down on that as a primary food source for most of their life.
[02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:30.520]  That's a, the Rocky mountain worm company in Colorado Springs has a deal worked out
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:34.720]  with the very well-known vape pen company, uh, open, they grow their
[02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:35.920]  products in their warehouse.
[02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:40.320]  They chop down their plants and the waste from their plants is then, uh, it's mixed
[02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:44.520]  properly so that it's a MED compliant and the MED has approved this transaction.
[02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:48.200]  They send all of the waste to the Rocky mountain worm company and the Rocky
[02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:52.840]  mountain worm company feeds that back to their worms and the worms compost that.
[02:02:53.160 --> 02:02:56.480]  And then the Rocky mountain worm company in turn sells their worm
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:03:01.360]  castings at a discount back to open vapes grow and it goes full circle.
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:01.680]  Yeah.
[02:03:01.680 --> 02:03:04.320]  So it's getting reused and refed back to the worms.
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:06.760]  It's kind of keeping it a little more eco-friendly.
[02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:10.200]  We need to learn as growers, as professional responsible growers, it is
[02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:12.800]  time to figure out how to reduce our carbon footprint.
[02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:14.360]  I don't know how to do that very well.
[02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:17.760]  Well, a lot of the places, the laws around cannabis make that
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:20.520]  specific topic incredibly brutal.
[02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:21.000]  Right.
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:24.000]  In Boulder, I think they have to run solar to offset all of their
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:25.400]  electricity or something similar.
[02:03:25.400 --> 02:03:29.960]  They passed a law in Boulder saying a hundred per year marijuana businesses
[02:03:29.960 --> 02:03:33.600]  had to be a hundred percent energy neutral, which means they can't consume
[02:03:33.600 --> 02:03:34.720]  any power they don't generate.
[02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:39.720]  Um, and immediately after passing that law, they realized how, um,
[02:03:39.720 --> 02:03:43.360]  unenforceable or not unenforceable, but unfeasible it was to require that
[02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:43.960]  immediately.
[02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:50.520]  Um, and so they've been given some time to, to upgrade, but, uh, um, it's
[02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:54.160]  one of the things that made Pueblo so popular is that we allow greenhouse.
[02:03:54.760 --> 02:03:56.440]  Um, Denver is not allowed greenhouse.
[02:03:56.440 --> 02:03:57.760]  Boulder does not allow greenhouse.
[02:03:57.800 --> 02:04:00.000]  And we have the prime greenhouse area here.
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:00.560]  It's perfect.
[02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:01.360]  Greenhouse country.
[02:04:01.920 --> 02:04:03.880]  It's beautiful country here to grow cannabis or hemp.
[02:04:04.040 --> 02:04:04.240]  Yep.
[02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:07.080]  We designated, um, a whole bunch of water.
[02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:11.200]  Just kind of set it aside for, you know, that's all will East and marijuana
[02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:12.400]  grows at the beginning of this.
[02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:14.040]  We've barely touched that number.
[02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:14.440]  Cool.
[02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:17.800]  Um, so there's a ton of that still kind of in reserve, even with the
[02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:19.240]  industry as big as it is down here.
[02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:21.760]  That's one of the hardest things to do is to get the water rights.
[02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:24.440]  Once you get something set up, you have to get a water lawyer.
[02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:28.720]  It was something nobody thought of until about a year and a half, two years ago,
[02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:34.880]  when we finally finished the rules and regs process, um, you can't just hammer
[02:04:34.880 --> 02:04:38.840]  out a well and go to town down here in Southern Colorado, we've got a lot of
[02:04:38.840 --> 02:04:40.120]  rules when it comes to water here.
[02:04:40.240 --> 02:04:40.440]  Yeah.
[02:04:40.440 --> 02:04:43.120]  Well, they know, they know that big commercial grows are coming and
[02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:46.160]  trying to use up the water and they want to keep it for you and I had a drink.
[02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:47.120]  Which is cool.
[02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:48.760]  You know, they've got a good water plan down here.
[02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:53.320]  So all that's taken care of the, it's one of the more recent anti pot talking
[02:04:53.320 --> 02:04:58.400]  points is how much water the plant drinks or how much energy growing an indoor
[02:04:58.400 --> 02:05:03.280]  cost is like, well, you know, if you didn't prohibit it in 46 of the 50 states,
[02:05:03.800 --> 02:05:05.560]  more of it would be grown under the sun.
[02:05:06.080 --> 02:05:09.480]  Um, we'd be using significantly less power to produce all this.
[02:05:09.480 --> 02:05:12.680]  If we could just grow it outdoors, like a normal crop, but oh no.
[02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:16.120]  When do we vote on the city elections for 200 and 300?
[02:05:16.160 --> 02:05:17.320]  Uh, in the presidential.
[02:05:17.560 --> 02:05:17.800]  Okay.
[02:05:17.800 --> 02:05:21.240]  So, uh, November, November, November 8th, we will put out a podcast.
[02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:21.880]  I'm making a note.
[02:05:22.760 --> 02:05:23.000]  Yeah.
[02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:26.520]  We'll do an election podcast at some point, people, this is not that episode.
[02:05:26.960 --> 02:05:31.080]  We need to guide people on what to vote on locally, but very specifically,
[02:05:31.240 --> 02:05:32.320]  we'll do that in a whole nother show.
[02:05:32.320 --> 02:05:34.080]  We'll do a little segment on it just for them.
[02:05:34.120 --> 02:05:37.560]  What's the date today is today the ninth today, maybe the ninth.
[02:05:37.720 --> 02:05:38.000]  Okay.
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:42.160]  So yesterday was the last day for people to submit ballot issue paperwork.
[02:05:42.160 --> 02:05:46.480]  So the final election ballots, they're all hammering out that paperwork now.
[02:05:46.480 --> 02:05:49.800]  So we'll have all the final information for November here in a week or two.
[02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:50.880]  So that's perfect.
[02:05:50.960 --> 02:05:51.360]  Perfect.
[02:05:51.400 --> 02:05:55.280]  We'll do an episode to teach you guys locally what to vote for, because
[02:05:55.280 --> 02:05:56.800]  the wording is confusing.
[02:05:56.840 --> 02:05:57.680]  I do agree with that.
[02:05:57.720 --> 02:06:00.080]  There's going to be, it's more way more than one question.
[02:06:00.080 --> 02:06:01.880]  It's not just going to be a yes or no vote.
[02:06:01.880 --> 02:06:02.160]  Yes.
[02:06:02.160 --> 02:06:02.800]  For weed vote.
[02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:03.600]  No against weed.
[02:06:03.600 --> 02:06:05.880]  It's going to be much more complicated than that.
[02:06:05.960 --> 02:06:06.320]  Yeah.
[02:06:06.600 --> 02:06:06.920]  All right.
[02:06:07.040 --> 02:06:09.880]  So, uh, this episode, I want to put this back on, uh, some, some
[02:06:09.880 --> 02:06:11.920]  educational topics on the rails.
[02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:12.400]  Yes.
[02:06:12.400 --> 02:06:13.320]  Back on some rails.
[02:06:13.400 --> 02:06:17.520]  Uh, Mike's had a headache and he took a couple of dabs of CBD when I got here
[02:06:17.520 --> 02:06:19.960]  and he's a really, his color came back.
[02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:20.880]  He's more relaxed.
[02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:22.800]  I can see that the headache has kind of gone away a little bit.
[02:06:22.800 --> 02:06:23.560]  You feeling better, bro?
[02:06:23.680 --> 02:06:25.000]  I'm feeling a lot better.
[02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:26.560]  Where's the proper container?
[02:06:26.560 --> 02:06:27.920]  Cause I got three of them to look alike.
[02:06:28.320 --> 02:06:40.200]  The product I'm consuming right now is 3% THC, uh, 1.3% CBD, 38.99% CBD, a, and
[02:06:40.200 --> 02:06:46.680]  six or 36.32% THC, a, um, and an additional 6% CBG.
[02:06:47.280 --> 02:06:51.920]  Um, so this has got a bizarrely wide range of cannabinoids in it.
[02:06:52.440 --> 02:06:54.600]  And, uh, really good on headaches.
[02:06:55.200 --> 02:06:57.280]  Other things, pain and inflammation as well.
[02:06:57.320 --> 02:06:58.440]  What kind of hash would you call that?
[02:06:58.440 --> 02:07:01.360]  What kind of, um, it depends what temperature it is.
[02:07:02.240 --> 02:07:07.000]  It's, it's intended as a shatter, um, at about 65 degrees.
[02:07:07.360 --> 02:07:08.520]  It's a pretty nice shatter.
[02:07:08.520 --> 02:07:09.680]  It shatters real nice.
[02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:11.000]  It's 70.
[02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:14.120]  It's a really sticky taffy.
[02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:16.360]  So you take two pieces and you pull it apart.
[02:07:16.360 --> 02:07:17.520]  It just kind of stretches into it.
[02:07:17.560 --> 02:07:19.200]  I watched you trying to get a dab out of there.
[02:07:19.280 --> 02:07:21.120]  It can be a little tricky to get a dab out of there.
[02:07:21.120 --> 02:07:23.520]  It, uh, it above like 65.
[02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:26.480]  So what he's talking about is a smokable concentrate.
[02:07:26.480 --> 02:07:31.120]  It's some hash, some shatter, uh, with a pretty good CBD to THC ratio.
[02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:31.320]  Yeah.
[02:07:31.320 --> 02:07:32.720]  It's about 50, 50.
[02:07:32.920 --> 02:07:35.120]  You can tell Mike was hurting about 20 minutes ago.
[02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:38.320]  He had a pretty good headache and he took two dabs of that and then put on his
[02:07:38.320 --> 02:07:40.360]  headphones, like, all right, dude, let's record a podcast.
[02:07:40.360 --> 02:07:44.120]  So the CBD definitely reduced the pain in your headache and it improved
[02:07:44.120 --> 02:07:45.240]  your attitude because of that.
[02:07:45.320 --> 02:07:45.680]  Oh yeah.
[02:07:45.680 --> 02:07:47.600]  I feel a hundred percent better.
[02:07:47.680 --> 02:07:52.400]  Um, now that I've put something that's half and half THC CBD into my system for
[02:07:52.400 --> 02:07:54.840]  the day, um, my knees feel better.
[02:07:54.840 --> 02:07:57.040]  My neck, the tension in my neck feels better.
[02:07:57.080 --> 02:07:59.200]  Um, I had a wicked headache when I got here, folks.
[02:07:59.200 --> 02:08:02.680]  I was, uh, uh, we're sitting at the table kind of catching up and dabbing.
[02:08:02.680 --> 02:08:06.040]  And I'm basically just staring at the table, rubbing my eyes and my temples
[02:08:06.040 --> 02:08:07.000]  cause it hurts so bad.
[02:08:07.520 --> 02:08:11.160]  I'm thinking I might not podcast tonight and I might just have to bail after a dab
[02:08:11.160 --> 02:08:12.480]  or two and go home cause I'm hurting.
[02:08:13.120 --> 02:08:17.560]  And, uh, the addition of some CBD into my world has reset that completely.
[02:08:18.240 --> 02:08:21.880]  Um, I've been a big fan of CBD for a long time.
[02:08:22.680 --> 02:08:24.640]  Um, it's good for what ails you.
[02:08:24.800 --> 02:08:25.520]  I'll put it that way.
[02:08:25.560 --> 02:08:26.280]  That's the truth.
[02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:29.360]  Uh, one thing that I, and I, I've said it on the show.
[02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:31.600]  I'm not a huge smoker of CBD.
[02:08:31.600 --> 02:08:33.120]  I don't use a lot of CBD products.
[02:08:33.120 --> 02:08:35.880]  When I smoke, I prefer a nice THC head buzz.
[02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:37.000]  I want to get high.
[02:08:37.320 --> 02:08:38.480]  I want to make my head spin.
[02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:39.640]  I want to get confused.
[02:08:39.640 --> 02:08:40.440]  I want to get goofy.
[02:08:40.440 --> 02:08:41.360]  I want to get talkative.
[02:08:41.560 --> 02:08:42.880]  That's what a good sativa does to me.
[02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:47.840]  When I smoke too much CBD, I honestly just get lazy and it kind of ruins my high.
[02:08:48.280 --> 02:08:50.360]  Uh, yeah, I'm not stoned right now.
[02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:54.760]  And that's, I took four knobs, all THC dabs here a minute ago.
[02:08:55.200 --> 02:08:57.960]  Um, and I had a nice little buzz going on, but right before the show, I
[02:08:57.960 --> 02:08:59.120]  didn't want my headache to come back.
[02:08:59.120 --> 02:09:04.160]  So I took two more, um, half and half THC CBD dabs and it, uh, it brought
[02:09:04.160 --> 02:09:06.080]  me my high back down to like a two.
[02:09:06.440 --> 02:09:06.840]  Nice.
[02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:07.680]  I'm kind of nice.
[02:09:07.680 --> 02:09:09.560]  You're about to have some Clementine here.
[02:09:09.680 --> 02:09:13.120]  If you, I've got some Jack, I've got some pineapple Jack.
[02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:14.600]  If you want to dab at that, feel free to reach in.
[02:09:14.600 --> 02:09:16.640]  I'm going to pull this piece off right here for myself, but here's some
[02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:17.960]  piece.
[02:09:18.120 --> 02:09:19.440]  That's like six of my dabs.
[02:09:19.480 --> 02:09:20.560]  It looks like a flag.
[02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:25.000]  It does look like kind of like a flag is a car kept for you at a model train.
[02:09:25.400 --> 02:09:27.640]  That dad would be American flag size.
[02:09:27.640 --> 02:09:28.160]  There you go.
[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:28.640]  Perfect.
[02:09:28.640 --> 02:09:29.160]  Yes, it would.
[02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:31.520]  It's probably about 0.3 ish.
[02:09:31.560 --> 02:09:31.960]  I don't know.
[02:09:32.520 --> 02:09:38.440]  Uh, so I, I don't use a lot of CBD products, but one time, uh, listeners of
[02:09:38.440 --> 02:09:44.160]  this podcast will know, uh, over a year ago in April of 2015, we'd be lube incident.
[02:09:44.240 --> 02:09:50.880]  But no, uh, when I hit my head, I hit my head in April and I was having issues.
[02:09:50.920 --> 02:09:54.120]  Uh, my head hurt for three weeks.
[02:09:54.480 --> 02:09:56.320]  Like, honestly, my head was throbbing.
[02:09:56.320 --> 02:09:57.240]  I w I was fucked up.
[02:09:57.240 --> 02:09:59.440]  I had a traumatic, I have a traumatic brain injury.
[02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:01.400]  I still have post-concussion syndrome.
[02:10:01.640 --> 02:10:04.840]  I have a lot of, it's been over 18 months and I still have
[02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:06.600]  effects from that concussion.
[02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:08.160]  I knocked myself clean the fuck out.
[02:10:08.160 --> 02:10:11.760]  I was out for a good 30 to 45 seconds, like unconscious on the ground.
[02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:14.000]  People had to pick me up, get me going again.
[02:10:14.800 --> 02:10:16.120]  Um, it fucked me up.
[02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:18.400]  My head hurt for several days.
[02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:24.360]  I could not get right when I took a dab of, you weren't yourself for six weeks after.
[02:10:24.440 --> 02:10:29.800]  Yeah, no, I was myself for six months after it felt like there was a substantial
[02:10:30.360 --> 02:10:33.080]  improvement after about six weeks.
[02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:37.800]  But I mean, it took half a year before you were feeling like yourself all the way.
[02:10:37.800 --> 02:10:38.120]  Yeah.
[02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:39.160]  Yeah.
[02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:40.080]  But so.
[02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:42.960]  Spencer would invite me over just to check on me.
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:44.000]  He'd be like, bro, come hang out.
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:44.440]  Come kick it.
[02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:46.160]  You've been like, he could tell I was getting depressed.
[02:10:46.160 --> 02:10:48.560]  Cause when you hit your head and have a traumatic brain injury, you get depressed
[02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:50.360]  and shit, cause you're not the same that you used to be.
[02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:51.920]  My skills weren't where they were.
[02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:53.040]  And I was bummed out.
[02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:55.440]  So my friends were really hanging out and trying to help me out.
[02:10:55.440 --> 02:10:57.200]  Shout out to all my friends that helped me through that head injury.
[02:10:57.600 --> 02:11:01.480]  But Spence would invite me over and one night he's like, bro, I made some CBD
[02:11:01.480 --> 02:11:06.160]  hash oil for the cannabis cup and this shit actually won the best CBD concentrate
[02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:07.240]  at the high times cannabis cup.
[02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:10.320]  But he gave me a big fat dab of it.
[02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:11.400]  He goes, dog hit this.
[02:11:11.440 --> 02:11:14.920]  Cause when I would smoke normal shatter, like THC or sativas, my
[02:11:14.920 --> 02:11:16.200]  head would throb even more.
[02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:19.560]  It would just be like, and I can feel it.
[02:11:20.040 --> 02:11:23.080]  And it felt like I had, it felt like I had a belt around my head or like my
[02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:26.960]  hat was way too tight is what it felt like all day, every day for a couple,
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:32.120]  for like weeks and Spence gives me these CBD dabs and I breathed in with the dab
[02:11:32.120 --> 02:11:36.000]  and I blew out that dab and it felt like you just undid that belt about one notch.
[02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:39.200]  It didn't like fix it, but it totally undid that belt a notch.
[02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:42.320]  And Maddie and Spence looked at me and they go, wow, did that help?
[02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:43.760]  And I was like, yeah, how could you tell?
[02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:46.360]  And like, you sat up, your neck went straight again.
[02:11:46.760 --> 02:11:47.480]  And I was like, what do you mean?
[02:11:47.480 --> 02:11:49.920]  I'm like, you've been like slouching weird and you've been like crooked.
[02:11:50.320 --> 02:11:52.120]  And I was like, well, let me get another dad like that.
[02:11:52.120 --> 02:11:56.320]  And after like three or four of those CBD dabs, I was like, I haven't felt this
[02:11:56.320 --> 02:11:58.080]  good since before I hit my head.
[02:11:58.080 --> 02:11:59.800]  Like it really did something to me.
[02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:00.400]  It fixed.
[02:12:00.720 --> 02:12:03.680]  And so they gave me some of that stuff and they're like, dad, this like dab it
[02:12:03.680 --> 02:12:07.680]  every day and it's got me, it really did help.
[02:12:07.840 --> 02:12:14.920]  I found a good half THC, half CBD mix about, oh, maybe two years ago.
[02:12:15.120 --> 02:12:17.600]  Um, and it was really hard to come by back then.
[02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:21.920]  Um, but I've got a lot of inflammation in like my knees and my neck.
[02:12:22.520 --> 02:12:28.320]  Um, where it's just for one stupid medical reason or another, the bones
[02:12:28.320 --> 02:12:31.120]  grind on each other and the tissue gets swollen.
[02:12:31.120 --> 02:12:33.400]  We're both over you're like six, four, right?
[02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:33.760]  Yep.
[02:12:33.800 --> 02:12:34.760]  I'm six, five.
[02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:34.960]  Yep.
[02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:36.560]  You probably weigh a good two 30.
[02:12:36.560 --> 02:12:37.880]  I'm guessing I'm not good at that.
[02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:38.400]  Good day.
[02:12:38.520 --> 02:12:38.880]  Okay.
[02:12:40.520 --> 02:12:41.400]  I'm not good at that shit.
[02:12:41.560 --> 02:12:43.720]  So Mike probably 250 ish over there.
[02:12:43.720 --> 02:12:47.720]  I'm guessing by that reaction, uh, I'm right about 200 pounds.
[02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:49.880]  Most of the time, these knees, bro.
[02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:53.720]  God, our knees get, there's so much leverage going on guys.
[02:12:53.720 --> 02:12:54.720]  Our sizes, legs.
[02:12:54.760 --> 02:12:57.520]  How many times have you stood up into like a heating duct?
[02:12:57.800 --> 02:12:58.280]  Oh yeah.
[02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:00.400]  And just cramped your neck.
[02:13:00.440 --> 02:13:04.240]  Well, when I busted my head, I really jerked my neck back like completely.
[02:13:04.240 --> 02:13:06.480]  So that still, and I've been in car accidents.
[02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:07.720]  I grew up in Colorado.
[02:13:07.720 --> 02:13:10.080]  There's a lot of fun stuff here that you can tumble down.
[02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:16.520]  Car wheels with skis, unreleasing on my feet was one of the really fun ones
[02:13:16.520 --> 02:13:18.280]  that led to no cartilage in either knee.
[02:13:18.920 --> 02:13:21.640]  Um, I rode bicycles as a kid in California.
[02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:26.880]  But, uh, the, the end results, all this trauma over the years of having fun in
[02:13:26.880 --> 02:13:30.280]  Colorado is that, uh, there's a lot of inflammation and a lot of swelling
[02:13:30.280 --> 02:13:32.360]  in a places that press on nerves.
[02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:37.160]  Um, and then that causes phantom nerve pain or basically the same stuff
[02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:41.360]  amputees get when like they lose a finger and then the finger tingles or hurts.
[02:13:42.040 --> 02:13:48.080]  Um, those nerves create or, or makeup or feel that they're getting
[02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:49.440]  signals they're not really getting.
[02:13:49.880 --> 02:13:53.480]  And it can feel like it's tingling or tickling, or it can feel like it's on
[02:13:53.480 --> 02:13:57.760]  fire or stuck in a car door or it'll go numb.
[02:13:58.280 --> 02:14:02.720]  Um, and when I first stumbled on, uh, medical marijuana, that was one of the
[02:14:02.720 --> 02:14:05.720]  things I liked is it would help me ignore that sensation.
[02:14:06.280 --> 02:14:11.800]  Um, but it wasn't until I found something that was a good ratio with THC CBD that,
[02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:16.560]  uh, I really started to attack that inflammation and bring it down to a
[02:14:16.560 --> 02:14:17.920]  point where it doesn't hurt anymore.
[02:14:18.440 --> 02:14:21.320]  Um, like it's hard to explain to somebody when you're at work and they're like,
[02:14:21.320 --> 02:14:22.440]  why are you rubbing your hand?
[02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:26.520]  And it's like, well, because the, the three small fingers are numb.
[02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:31.040]  And the, my thumb and my index finger feel like they're stuck in a car door.
[02:14:31.480 --> 02:14:34.760]  And it was like that when I woke up and I can't make it go away, but like,
[02:14:34.760 --> 02:14:36.360]  which jacket did you want to try on?
[02:14:37.880 --> 02:14:40.680]  It's just one of those things that sucks that you just have to deal with.
[02:14:40.680 --> 02:14:44.680]  And until I found something with that really helped that inflammation, um, I
[02:14:44.680 --> 02:14:47.440]  was just taking random pills that the doctor gave me and going to the
[02:14:47.440 --> 02:14:50.920]  chiropractor and the pills didn't do a fucking thing other than mess with my
[02:14:50.920 --> 02:14:54.680]  stomach and my liver, but the chiropractor was helping some.
[02:14:55.280 --> 02:14:59.480]  Um, but when I found something that's half THC, half CBD, that inflammation
[02:14:59.480 --> 02:15:04.680]  really started to come down and I started having lower pain days, um,
[02:15:04.720 --> 02:15:07.200]  lower crazy sensation days.
[02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:11.400]  And then slowly, but surely I started getting pain free days.
[02:15:11.800 --> 02:15:15.880]  I do those first couple of pain free days where the dude, I was like,
[02:15:15.880 --> 02:15:16.600]  it was a teenager.
[02:15:16.600 --> 02:15:17.040]  Yeah.
[02:15:17.080 --> 02:15:18.800]  Like it never happened.
[02:15:18.800 --> 02:15:20.920]  You got your endocannabinoid system back in line.
[02:15:21.640 --> 02:15:25.120]  And now that, uh, the rec industry has progressed to where it is.
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:28.880]  Um, there are several places in town where I can go in and pick up half
[02:15:28.880 --> 02:15:31.000]  THC, half CBD concentrates.
[02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:34.800]  And like, when I get home from the end of a long day and my knees are swollen
[02:15:34.800 --> 02:15:38.760]  a little bit and my feet hurt and my back hurts and I've eaten enough bowls
[02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:42.680]  of shit for the day and I'm in kind of a foul mood, two or three dabs of that.
[02:15:43.360 --> 02:15:46.400]  Um, we'll have me feeling like none of that happened physically.
[02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:48.840]  And, uh, it's just a wonder against for the day now.
[02:15:49.840 --> 02:15:51.080]  CBD for the win.
[02:15:51.160 --> 02:15:51.480]  Yeah.
[02:15:51.480 --> 02:15:52.440]  CBD ramble.
[02:15:52.800 --> 02:15:53.320]  No, I love it.
[02:15:53.320 --> 02:15:55.640]  That's that's I, that's why I brought you on for this episode.
[02:15:56.840 --> 02:15:57.880]  I go through a lot of this.
[02:15:57.920 --> 02:16:00.520]  Um, Doug, who's been on the episode before too.
[02:16:00.840 --> 02:16:01.640]  I saw Doug today.
[02:16:01.640 --> 02:16:02.320]  Shout out to Doug.
[02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:03.200]  Dougie looks great today.
[02:16:03.200 --> 02:16:04.200]  It's good to see you doing well.
[02:16:04.600 --> 02:16:08.240]  Um, CBD has changed his life a hundred percent, right?
[02:16:08.280 --> 02:16:08.640]  Yes.
[02:16:08.680 --> 02:16:10.840]  Medical marijuana has saved Doug's life.
[02:16:10.920 --> 02:16:11.360]  For sure.
[02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:15.120]  I don't know if I honestly, I, and it's, it's hard to think of stuff like this
[02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:18.360]  right now, cause we've lost a lot of people this year, but I don't know if
[02:16:18.680 --> 02:16:22.720]  Doug could still be here without medical marijuana, you know, mentally,
[02:16:22.720 --> 02:16:26.640]  spiritually, and physically Doug would not be the same person without medical
[02:16:26.640 --> 02:16:27.120]  marijuana.
[02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:31.880]  I mean, I, I, I saw some of the same stuff I was going through in his world.
[02:16:31.880 --> 02:16:37.160]  Like, I mean, listeners, if you don't have a lot of like physical pain in your
[02:16:37.160 --> 02:16:40.880]  life, or if you've never really been injured for a while, um, it's kind of
[02:16:40.880 --> 02:16:46.000]  hard to understand what people who do have nerve damage and pain like that go
[02:16:46.040 --> 02:16:46.400]  through.
[02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:52.560]  And it's the best way I can describe it is it's like a sound and it gets louder
[02:16:52.560 --> 02:16:53.560]  and louder and louder.
[02:16:53.560 --> 02:16:58.240]  And as it gets louder, the world around you gets smaller and that sound presses
[02:16:58.240 --> 02:16:59.080]  in on the world.
[02:16:59.080 --> 02:17:03.800]  And there are some days where there's nothing but that sound, like it's just
[02:17:03.800 --> 02:17:04.320]  pain.
[02:17:04.640 --> 02:17:07.880]  It doesn't matter that if you don't pick up the phone, you're not going to have
[02:17:07.880 --> 02:17:08.800]  a job later.
[02:17:09.200 --> 02:17:12.160]  It doesn't matter that you've got to go to the bathroom.
[02:17:12.160 --> 02:17:16.440]  It doesn't matter that you had something really important to do that day that you
[02:17:16.440 --> 02:17:20.320]  have to get up and go do now for, uh, or it's, you know, you're going to lose it
[02:17:20.320 --> 02:17:20.760]  forever.
[02:17:20.760 --> 02:17:21.440]  It doesn't matter.
[02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:22.600]  All there is, is the pain.
[02:17:23.160 --> 02:17:27.200]  Um, and you'll do anything to get away from it or make it stop for a while.
[02:17:27.200 --> 02:17:30.680]  You'll give people a ridiculous sums of money because they claim to have a
[02:17:30.680 --> 02:17:32.320]  treatment that works.
[02:17:32.920 --> 02:17:35.080]  Um, and for the most part, nothing helps.
[02:17:35.560 --> 02:17:39.360]  Um, like I was wearing a thing that electrocuted me slowly, like a tens unit
[02:17:39.920 --> 02:17:42.040]  and it works okay for some issues.
[02:17:42.440 --> 02:17:47.080]  But for mine, it was literally just an electrical shock that scrambled the pain
[02:17:47.080 --> 02:17:48.520]  impulse on the way to my brain.
[02:17:48.960 --> 02:17:52.480]  Like that was the best that Western science had for me.
[02:17:53.080 --> 02:18:00.840]  Um, and then one day I hit some, uh, high CBD, um, hash and about half an hour later,
[02:18:00.840 --> 02:18:02.640]  I was like, wait a second, nothing hurts.
[02:18:03.240 --> 02:18:06.400]  Um, and I'd kind of drum my, both my hands on the table and I was like, and I
[02:18:06.400 --> 02:18:08.320]  could feel on my fingers and none of them hurt.
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:09.880]  Like, what is that?
[02:18:09.880 --> 02:18:11.040]  Where did that come from?
[02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:13.480]  Where'd that guy with that vial of sticky shit go?
[02:18:14.240 --> 02:18:18.600]  Um, but yeah, it's a CBD is absolutely wonderful.
[02:18:19.160 --> 02:18:22.640]  Um, and a lot of people are starting to figure it out so much so that there's a
[02:18:22.640 --> 02:18:24.240]  lot of scam and fake shit around.
[02:18:24.360 --> 02:18:24.640]  Yeah.
[02:18:24.640 --> 02:18:28.040]  Unfortunately that Chinese imported CBD shit.
[02:18:28.040 --> 02:18:28.680]  That's not real.
[02:18:28.680 --> 02:18:35.000]  You're not buying stuff with a lab test on it from, uh, a very accredited retailer.
[02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:36.360]  You don't know what you're getting.
[02:18:36.360 --> 02:18:38.240]  I'm, I'm sorry to inform you.
[02:18:38.320 --> 02:18:38.600]  Yeah.
[02:18:38.960 --> 02:18:39.800]  Unfortunately.
[02:18:40.120 --> 02:18:45.600]  Um, it's, uh, there's a lot of research going on into CBD right now.
[02:18:45.640 --> 02:18:50.000]  Um, hopefully in the next 10 years, we know a lot more about its medical
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:55.680]  applications, but, uh, I can vouch for its ability to calm a headache and a
[02:18:55.680 --> 02:19:00.120]  lower inflammation and swelling in your nerves or around your nerves and your
[02:19:00.120 --> 02:19:03.680]  joints so that, uh, those pain signals aren't just debilitating.
[02:19:03.800 --> 02:19:05.720]  It produces vomiting and nausea.
[02:19:05.880 --> 02:19:07.800]  I feel like you're going to smoke some CBD.
[02:19:07.800 --> 02:19:08.680]  It'll take that away.
[02:19:08.960 --> 02:19:10.200]  It's suppresses seizures.
[02:19:10.200 --> 02:19:12.280]  That's something we've talked about on the podcast before.
[02:19:12.680 --> 02:19:15.560]  Uh, it'll make you not have convulsions and seizures.
[02:19:15.560 --> 02:19:16.000]  Hopefully.
[02:19:16.320 --> 02:19:17.960]  Uh, that's like the most popular reason.
[02:19:17.960 --> 02:19:21.760]  Everyone, but it's, there's a several different forms of epilepsy, right?
[02:19:22.320 --> 02:19:27.200]  Um, that THC work on and that CBD work on, and then that the two together work on.
[02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:28.600]  That's a good, all that stuff.
[02:19:28.600 --> 02:19:29.040]  Psychotic.
[02:19:29.040 --> 02:19:29.920]  Sympathy too.
[02:19:30.080 --> 02:19:30.560]  Oh yeah.
[02:19:30.680 --> 02:19:32.600]  Uh, it'll, it, uh, stops here.
[02:19:32.600 --> 02:19:33.520]  It's, it doesn't stop.
[02:19:33.560 --> 02:19:37.520]  It will slow down your PTSD and your nightmares and your thoughts.
[02:19:37.800 --> 02:19:42.480]  Uh, if you have PTSD, I always sleep amazingly well when I've been consumed.
[02:19:42.480 --> 02:19:42.960]  Yes.
[02:19:43.640 --> 02:19:44.760]  I'd helps with anxiety.
[02:19:45.360 --> 02:19:46.480]  It's an anti-inflammatory.
[02:19:46.480 --> 02:19:47.200]  We talked about that.
[02:19:47.200 --> 02:19:49.200]  It's an anti, uh, an antioxidant.
[02:19:49.240 --> 02:19:51.840]  It helps with degenerative disorders, which is pretty cool.
[02:19:51.840 --> 02:19:54.200]  It's acted as a protective, uh, an anti-tumor.
[02:19:54.280 --> 02:19:56.680]  It'll, it'll, it will not destroy your tumors.
[02:19:56.680 --> 02:19:58.600]  I think you need THC to destroy a tumor.
[02:19:58.600 --> 02:20:00.640]  There's slow a tumor for sure.
[02:20:00.680 --> 02:20:07.240]  Um, there's a lot of very, very, very recent, um, cancer research on THC
[02:20:07.240 --> 02:20:13.160]  and CBD and CBD slows tumor growth majorly is what they're seeing in mice
[02:20:13.160 --> 02:20:15.360]  trials, um, which is huge.
[02:20:15.360 --> 02:20:19.560]  If, if, uh, if we can slow tumor growth, that gives us a better chance to fight.
[02:20:19.560 --> 02:20:20.080]  Yes.
[02:20:20.160 --> 02:20:20.400]  Yes.
[02:20:20.400 --> 02:20:24.520]  Um, the good news to that coin or that equation is that THC has been shown to
[02:20:24.520 --> 02:20:30.240]  kill it, um, uh, which is kind of where the, you know, the, the first real
[02:20:30.240 --> 02:20:34.880]  medical research into Rick Simpson oil style products, um, that would be, it
[02:20:34.920 --> 02:20:36.240]  concentrates of both.
[02:20:36.920 --> 02:20:42.600]  Um, that's why those are so effective in the, um, on a little bit
[02:20:42.600 --> 02:20:44.040]  big from that last tiny dab.
[02:20:44.160 --> 02:20:45.400]  I'm going to take a dab while you ramble on.
[02:20:45.400 --> 02:20:49.360]  But as the, the medical research that we're starting to get, I mean, it, it
[02:20:49.360 --> 02:20:51.520]  really isn't, it's infancy, it's fancy folks.
[02:20:51.520 --> 02:20:55.280]  I'm not saying that, uh, if you have cancer and you find some of this, you
[02:20:55.280 --> 02:20:56.600]  can cure yourself real easy.
[02:20:56.600 --> 02:21:01.240]  That's not what I'm saying here, but, uh, um, the research is promising.
[02:21:01.240 --> 02:21:06.760]  And honestly, in our lifetimes, we might see legitimate, um, packaged,
[02:21:06.760 --> 02:21:09.920]  perfectly dosed, you've got this kind of cancer.
[02:21:09.920 --> 02:21:13.160]  We're going to start you on this much THC, this much CBD style
[02:21:13.160 --> 02:21:18.920]  treatments, um, in our lifetime, which would be, oh, that would make me so happy.
[02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.400]  Did you smell that dad that I just took a little bit?
[02:21:21.440 --> 02:21:23.120]  Oh, that smells, it tastes so good.
[02:21:23.120 --> 02:21:24.120]  I tasted a minute ago.
[02:21:24.120 --> 02:21:27.400]  That's the Turpex pineapple Jack and the nugg run shatter.
[02:21:27.400 --> 02:21:28.320]  That was delicious.
[02:21:28.440 --> 02:21:29.600]  Yeah, man.
[02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:34.280]  Another thing I wanted to mention that CBD does, it's an antidepressant, which,
[02:21:34.280 --> 02:21:38.360]  you know, I think it it's got its own antidepressant properties, but also if a
[02:21:38.360 --> 02:21:41.760]  dude's not hurting every day, that's going to work as an antidepressant.
[02:21:41.760 --> 02:21:44.720]  If you're not having PTSD symptoms and panic attacks, you're
[02:21:44.720 --> 02:21:45.920]  going to be less depressed.
[02:21:46.240 --> 02:21:50.600]  I mean, honestly, most days when I wake up and I'm not hurting, it feels like my
[02:21:50.600 --> 02:21:53.040]  birthday still, cause they're pretty rare.
[02:21:53.600 --> 02:21:56.720]  Um, most days I wake up at least a little stiff, a little sore,
[02:21:56.720 --> 02:21:58.160]  something somewhere screaming.
[02:21:58.520 --> 02:21:59.560]  You're only getting older, buddy.
[02:21:59.760 --> 02:22:00.160]  I know.
[02:22:00.160 --> 02:22:00.600]  Right.
[02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.920]  Well, when I was a teenager, I had more than one doctor go, if you don't knock
[02:22:03.920 --> 02:22:05.560]  this shit off, it's going to hurt when you're 30.
[02:22:05.600 --> 02:22:05.840]  Yeah.
[02:22:06.160 --> 02:22:07.880]  And I was like, shut up, put a cast on it.
[02:22:08.080 --> 02:22:08.280]  Yeah.
[02:22:08.280 --> 02:22:08.920]  Put a cast on it.
[02:22:08.920 --> 02:22:09.640]  I got shit to do.
[02:22:09.680 --> 02:22:10.200]  You gotta go.
[02:22:10.240 --> 02:22:11.760]  Um, where'd my rollerblades go?
[02:22:11.800 --> 02:22:13.640]  So I cast off early cause I got other shit.
[02:22:14.360 --> 02:22:16.880]  Like I was a teenager in Colorado in the nineties.
[02:22:16.880 --> 02:22:20.040]  We were still free to like ride our bikes off roofs and stuff.
[02:22:20.040 --> 02:22:21.880]  I remember like before everything was nerfed.
[02:22:21.920 --> 02:22:22.200]  Yeah.
[02:22:22.240 --> 02:22:24.200]  Before we were looking at fucking padded, bro.
[02:22:24.200 --> 02:22:24.760]  What the hell?
[02:22:24.800 --> 02:22:26.800]  We didn't get trophies when our team didn't win.
[02:22:26.880 --> 02:22:28.720]  Kids are going to be a bunch of pussies in the future.
[02:22:28.840 --> 02:22:31.840]  It was the last generation that really got that.
[02:22:31.880 --> 02:22:32.200]  Yeah.
[02:22:32.240 --> 02:22:33.040]  We're the same age.
[02:22:33.040 --> 02:22:33.920]  We took full advantage here.
[02:22:33.960 --> 02:22:34.720]  We're the same age.
[02:22:34.720 --> 02:22:36.160]  I was right there with you.
[02:22:37.160 --> 02:22:40.120]  But, uh, I remember more than one doctor going, it's going to hurt when you're
[02:22:40.120 --> 02:22:42.080]  30 and dude, they were all right.
[02:22:42.080 --> 02:22:42.600]  It does.
[02:22:43.240 --> 02:22:48.240]  Um, but the days that are pain free, most of those I can accredit to last
[02:22:48.240 --> 02:22:51.760]  night I was, I was hurting a little, I knew I was hurting, so I consumed a whole
[02:22:51.760 --> 02:22:57.480]  lot of THC, CBD concentrate instead of my normal mix of predominantly THC,
[02:22:57.480 --> 02:23:03.840]  flour and shatter, and, uh, I wake up feeling a lot better, um, really restful
[02:23:03.840 --> 02:23:10.920]  sleep, um, and, uh, really, really nice, uh, work on the inflammation while I sleep.
[02:23:11.880 --> 02:23:15.000]  One thing we should totally mention is CBD by yours by itself.
[02:23:15.520 --> 02:23:16.840]  Will not get you high.
[02:23:17.040 --> 02:23:20.840]  No, you can consume a lot of CBD and you may get a little grin, but I don't think
[02:23:20.840 --> 02:23:23.400]  you're going to get like any psychedelic psychoactive effect.
[02:23:23.440 --> 02:23:24.440]  It's not a high.
[02:23:24.440 --> 02:23:29.560]  The, the mood improvement is like you were saying, when the pain goes away,
[02:23:29.560 --> 02:23:31.560]  your mood goes up a thousand times.
[02:23:31.960 --> 02:23:35.880]  Like, I mean, if you don't know what I'm talking about, think about getting a
[02:23:35.880 --> 02:23:39.880]  bee sting when you get that stinger pulled out or a splinter pulled out, or
[02:23:39.880 --> 02:23:43.680]  you've got a big painful zit that finally pops like in that relief of pressure.
[02:23:44.360 --> 02:23:49.440]  Um, imagine that like through your whole arm, like if your whole arm felt like it
[02:23:49.440 --> 02:23:53.560]  was on fire and then one moment it stopped feeling like that and just felt
[02:23:53.560 --> 02:23:58.680]  like your arm again, um, the sensation's incredible when we finally get there,
[02:23:58.760 --> 02:24:00.480]  you know how well it's working.
[02:24:02.120 --> 02:24:08.760]  Uh, another thing that we can talk about is CBD will reduce the effects of THC.
[02:24:08.760 --> 02:24:12.320]  So if you're a little too high, if you've had too many dabs, if you're new and you
[02:24:12.320 --> 02:24:16.680]  take a big giant dab of THC and you're just spinning, you're fucked up, you take
[02:24:16.680 --> 02:24:19.040]  a little dab of CBD and it will calm you down a little bit.
[02:24:19.040 --> 02:24:20.080]  It'll balance out your high.
[02:24:20.160 --> 02:24:22.880]  There's a, some company that made a product they were calling, I think,
[02:24:22.880 --> 02:24:27.440]  rescue pills and it was just a CBD capsules, like CBD filled gel cap.
[02:24:27.480 --> 02:24:28.120]  That's pretty cool.
[02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:31.960]  Um, yeah, if your, your buddy took too many dabs and they're freaking out a
[02:24:31.960 --> 02:24:35.720]  little bit, just hand them this and, and you know, give him a hug for half an
[02:24:35.720 --> 02:24:38.240]  hour, wait for this to kick in a little bit.
[02:24:38.240 --> 02:24:39.720]  Some Doritos and you'd be just fine.
[02:24:39.720 --> 02:24:44.800]  Um, a friend of mine makes, uh, for a relative of his that he's a caregiver
[02:24:44.800 --> 02:24:46.640]  for, he makes CBD capsules.
[02:24:47.320 --> 02:24:51.200]  Um, and he does something to the oil to make it a little more bioavailable.
[02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:53.720]  And I was taking those at night for a while.
[02:24:53.720 --> 02:24:55.400]  I had a few and Oh, good Lord.
[02:24:55.400 --> 02:24:56.360]  Did I feel wonderful?
[02:24:57.720 --> 02:25:02.720]  Um, just pain free and, and just in a really, really nice mood.
[02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:03.720]  It was really nice.
[02:25:04.040 --> 02:25:07.960]  There are a couple of companies that are making CBD dog treats, which I think is
[02:25:07.960 --> 02:25:10.640]  really cool because a lot of the shepherd breeds are known for their
[02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:12.200]  dysplasia and hip problems.
[02:25:12.600 --> 02:25:15.800]  Uh, there's a shepherd dog that stayed at my house for a little while now, and he
[02:25:15.800 --> 02:25:19.320]  gets some CBD treats occasionally, and he seems to be a happy little dog.
[02:25:19.480 --> 02:25:21.920]  Doesn't seem to cause him any problems and it's going to keep him pain-free.
[02:25:21.920 --> 02:25:23.000]  Keep his little hips happy.
[02:25:23.480 --> 02:25:29.120]  I've got, uh, um, a Malamute that's, uh, pushing for 13 and a half.
[02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:30.200]  Now she's almost 14.
[02:25:30.800 --> 02:25:33.080]  Um, breed expect life expectancy is eight.
[02:25:33.720 --> 02:25:39.800]  Um, and so her knees, her, her ankles, basically every joint is shot and you
[02:25:39.800 --> 02:25:43.400]  can see when she doesn't want to go up and down the stairs, I've been adding a
[02:25:43.400 --> 02:25:45.920]  little THC CBD tincture to her food.
[02:25:46.480 --> 02:25:49.760]  Um, and the days that I added, she's five years younger.
[02:25:49.840 --> 02:25:50.160]  Nice.
[02:25:50.160 --> 02:25:53.160]  Um, you can see it helping with the pain and the inflammation.
[02:25:53.280 --> 02:25:57.120]  Um, uh, it takes about 20 minutes, half an hour to kick in for her.
[02:25:57.840 --> 02:25:59.400]  And you can see the change overnight.
[02:26:00.200 --> 02:26:03.560]  I had five or six customers come in looking for something for their dogs
[02:26:03.560 --> 02:26:04.640]  before I thought to try it.
[02:26:04.640 --> 02:26:05.800]  And yeah, I'm glad I did.
[02:26:06.320 --> 02:26:09.520]  And there are companies that are making specific edibles for dogs now.
[02:26:09.640 --> 02:26:13.320]  If there are things available at hemp stores that have CBD for your dog that
[02:26:13.320 --> 02:26:17.960]  are made in America with actual hemp products, um, there, I can't say there's
[02:26:17.960 --> 02:26:21.560]  anything wrong with that as long as it's made with real, real hemp or real cannabis.
[02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:21.800]  Yeah.
[02:26:21.800 --> 02:26:26.240]  Basically if it's sold in a brick and mortar retailer in the United States, it
[02:26:26.240 --> 02:26:30.040]  has to at least, uh, contain what the label says.
[02:26:30.760 --> 02:26:36.280]  Um, recently the, the DEA just sent out a thing to a bunch of CBD only companies.
[02:26:36.880 --> 02:26:40.360]  Um, and the internet kind of freaked out and was like, oh, they're just attacking
[02:26:40.360 --> 02:26:42.200]  weed like they always do it.
[02:26:42.200 --> 02:26:45.720]  It was, they were targeting the people that are selling like codfish oil and
[02:26:45.720 --> 02:26:49.360]  calling it CBD oil because people don't know any better and you can't take this
[02:26:49.360 --> 02:26:51.480]  stuff to a lab and get it tested as a civilian.
[02:26:51.520 --> 02:26:52.080]  But yeah.
[02:26:52.320 --> 02:26:54.960]  Um, you're just getting scammed out of money on the internet.
[02:26:54.960 --> 02:27:00.120]  So be careful if you're ordering online folks, but this, uh, the, if you've got
[02:27:00.120 --> 02:27:04.040]  a number of different ailments, um, you should get online and check out and see
[02:27:04.040 --> 02:27:07.920]  if there's any research on what THC and CBD can do for those for your specific
[02:27:07.920 --> 02:27:08.240]  ailment.
[02:27:08.240 --> 02:27:08.560]  Yeah.
[02:27:08.640 --> 02:27:12.040]  And then check out the laws in your state and see if, if and where you can get this
[02:27:12.040 --> 02:27:12.400]  stuff.
[02:27:12.760 --> 02:27:16.960]  And if you have to come take a vacation in Colorado, I see a lot of the people doing
[02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:17.760]  exactly that.
[02:27:17.760 --> 02:27:23.120]  They come, they visit at one of our rec stores and, uh, a good rec store will
[02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:26.360]  have a decent selection of CBD products at this point.
[02:27:26.920 --> 02:27:31.400]  Um, they might not have a huge selection or a wide selection, but they should have
[02:27:31.400 --> 02:27:31.760]  some,
[02:27:31.920 --> 02:27:34.040]  you can go to more than one store while you're here.
[02:27:34.040 --> 02:27:36.800]  So you'll find what you need to check out weed maps.
[02:27:36.800 --> 02:27:37.840]  You can check out leafly.
[02:27:37.880 --> 02:27:39.840]  There are menus available to see what you want.
[02:27:39.840 --> 02:27:42.560]  Unfortunately on the mobile apps, they cannot show you pricing anymore.
[02:27:43.240 --> 02:27:44.400]  Did they take that off the mobile?
[02:27:44.400 --> 02:27:44.560]  Yeah.
[02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:47.440]  All the pricing has gone on all the mobile apps, but you can still find them on the
[02:27:47.440 --> 02:27:47.680]  web.
[02:27:47.680 --> 02:27:52.440]  If you use your computer, it's a weed maps.com and leafly.
[02:27:52.440 --> 02:27:53.920]  L E a F L Y.
[02:27:54.200 --> 02:27:57.240]  If you're coming to Colorado, I think those are effective in all the marijuana
[02:27:57.240 --> 02:27:57.720]  States.
[02:27:57.840 --> 02:27:58.160]  Yeah.
[02:27:58.160 --> 02:27:59.520]  That's pretty much nationwide now.
[02:27:59.560 --> 02:27:59.760]  Yeah.
[02:27:59.760 --> 02:28:03.600]  So if you want to search for locations of your favorite, favorite strains or products
[02:28:03.600 --> 02:28:06.400]  or topicals or whatever you're looking for, go to those websites and you can find
[02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:09.800]  information on the products you're looking for and you can find specific locations
[02:28:09.800 --> 02:28:10.480]  that have them.
[02:28:10.800 --> 02:28:14.760]  Uh, don't get mad at me if a dispensary does not update their weed maps menu.
[02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:15.960]  Sometimes they forget.
[02:28:16.040 --> 02:28:20.440]  What I was about to say is like weed maps and leafly are great places to start your
[02:28:20.440 --> 02:28:20.920]  search.
[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:26.120]  But if you're looking for a very specific product, um, or even kind of a general
[02:28:26.120 --> 02:28:29.600]  product, you're looking for something with a certain ratio of cannabinoids,
[02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:31.760]  some THC, some CBD, something like that.
[02:28:32.320 --> 02:28:36.520]  Um, check out weed maps for leafly, make a list of possible shops, and then go ahead
[02:28:36.520 --> 02:28:41.000]  and give them a call and just a real quick ask them, Hey, what's your, your
[02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:42.000]  selection of blah.
[02:28:42.320 --> 02:28:45.080]  Like what do you, what do you have in for CBD options right now?
[02:28:45.280 --> 02:28:45.440]  Yeah.
[02:28:45.440 --> 02:28:46.360]  Black pig pens.
[02:28:46.920 --> 02:28:47.160]  Yeah.
[02:28:47.160 --> 02:28:51.000]  But like be specific in what you're looking for as much as you can.
[02:28:51.640 --> 02:28:56.840]  Um, and then, uh, narrow your list that way because I mean, the industry is weird
[02:28:56.880 --> 02:28:57.400]  right now.
[02:28:57.400 --> 02:29:01.000]  And, uh, you never know when somebody is going to walk in and say, give me all of
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:01.440]  that.
[02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:05.240]  So, uh, what's on their menu might not have anything to do with what's on their
[02:29:05.240 --> 02:29:06.800]  store shelf at this moment.
[02:29:07.280 --> 02:29:10.160]  It might just be stuff that's been on the store shelf in the last 30 days.
[02:29:10.280 --> 02:29:12.120]  I was shopping at green and healthy the other day.
[02:29:12.160 --> 02:29:16.600]  And I was frustrated because I wanted to, uh, I bought something and the guy behind
[02:29:16.600 --> 02:29:19.200]  me was frustrated because I'd purchased all of it.
[02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:21.400]  And he said, I want that.
[02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:23.160]  And she had to say it's gone.
[02:29:23.160 --> 02:29:24.440]  And he said, why is it on the list?
[02:29:24.520 --> 02:29:26.280]  And she's like, he just bought all of it.
[02:29:26.320 --> 02:29:26.760]  Sorry.
[02:29:26.760 --> 02:29:28.240]  So that's how quickly she can sell out.
[02:29:28.240 --> 02:29:29.480]  I bought an out and I cleaned them out.
[02:29:29.480 --> 02:29:30.280]  I took the bottom of that.
[02:29:30.280 --> 02:29:33.920]  And I watched a dude buy 160 things, a hard candies one time.
[02:29:34.640 --> 02:29:40.920]  Um, and it was just like, okay, let me get you a box and, and sweep all of these
[02:29:40.920 --> 02:29:41.720]  into the box.
[02:29:42.440 --> 02:29:46.280]  And like for the rest of the week, we had to tell people, sorry, we're out of that
[02:29:46.280 --> 02:29:47.280]  particular product line.
[02:29:47.280 --> 02:29:48.800]  And they were like, is there something wrong with it?
[02:29:49.400 --> 02:29:52.600]  It's like, no, it was something amazing with it.
[02:29:52.600 --> 02:29:55.920]  Apparently, honestly, every, every month I've worked in a dispensary that's
[02:29:55.960 --> 02:29:58.000]  happened with at least one product line once.
[02:29:58.360 --> 02:30:02.320]  I mean, sometimes it's only the last eight or 10 or 20 units or whatever, but it
[02:30:02.320 --> 02:30:02.920]  happens.
[02:30:02.960 --> 02:30:06.560]  I used to go to, you went with me, we went to the clinic in Denver and they had
[02:30:06.560 --> 02:30:08.000]  Durban poison wax.
[02:30:08.200 --> 02:30:08.360]  Yep.
[02:30:08.640 --> 02:30:10.120]  Uh, and they had vortex wax.
[02:30:10.160 --> 02:30:11.720]  I loved from the clinic.
[02:30:12.080 --> 02:30:14.200]  Uh, on Mexico in Denver, it's still open.
[02:30:14.200 --> 02:30:15.320]  They don't have these products anymore.
[02:30:15.320 --> 02:30:17.880]  They've changed their game, but they used to have, it was like three and a half
[02:30:17.880 --> 02:30:18.240]  years ago.
[02:30:18.240 --> 02:30:18.840]  Oh man.
[02:30:18.840 --> 02:30:20.080]  It was amazing.
[02:30:20.520 --> 02:30:25.200]  Uh, the vortex tasted like cranberries and dirty feet and rotten fruit.
[02:30:25.480 --> 02:30:26.840]  I don't know why you like that feet smell.
[02:30:26.920 --> 02:30:27.480]  Oh man.
[02:30:27.480 --> 02:30:31.560]  I just love that in my weed, but the high that he gave me, I couldn't focus on
[02:30:31.560 --> 02:30:31.880]  anything.
[02:30:31.880 --> 02:30:33.200]  It made my eyes jump around.
[02:30:33.200 --> 02:30:34.640]  Like I was on a bumpy road.
[02:30:34.960 --> 02:30:36.240]  Like it was really crazy.
[02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:40.080]  And that Durban poison, just, I love the flavor of good Durban poison wax.
[02:30:40.080 --> 02:30:41.680]  And that head high is just so amazing.
[02:30:41.880 --> 02:30:45.400]  So back in the day we'd go to the clinic and I would save up as much money as I
[02:30:45.400 --> 02:30:46.280]  could afford to save up.
[02:30:46.280 --> 02:30:48.680]  And I'd walk in there and I'd say, how much of that Durban poison do you have?
[02:30:48.680 --> 02:30:50.200]  And they'd say, there's about 14 grams.
[02:30:50.200 --> 02:30:51.320]  And I'd say, I'll take it.
[02:30:51.800 --> 02:30:53.800]  And then I'd say, how much of that vortex do you have?
[02:30:53.800 --> 02:30:56.280]  And they'd usually have somewhere between 14 and 28 grams.
[02:30:56.360 --> 02:30:57.040]  I would buy it.
[02:30:57.440 --> 02:30:58.400]  Like, and I would clean it out.
[02:30:58.400 --> 02:31:00.480]  And the guy behind me would be like, Oh yeah, he bought a lot of that.
[02:31:00.480 --> 02:31:01.040]  I want some.
[02:31:01.040 --> 02:31:03.160]  And they'd be like, sorry, he bought all of it.
[02:31:03.720 --> 02:31:03.840]  Yeah.
[02:31:03.840 --> 02:31:06.240]  I did it the other day with those delicious truffles.
[02:31:06.280 --> 02:31:08.080]  I, uh, they cut me off eventually.
[02:31:08.080 --> 02:31:10.480]  They thought I was flipping it, but I was really, I was smoking that shit.
[02:31:10.480 --> 02:31:10.920]  I love it.
[02:31:11.120 --> 02:31:14.360]  I was two and a half hours away from my house at the time I had to go stock up.
[02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:15.120]  Yeah.
[02:31:15.120 --> 02:31:18.960]  I got the last four boxes of Coda and I watched the lady behind me come in and
[02:31:18.960 --> 02:31:20.040]  go, Hey, do you guys have this?
[02:31:21.160 --> 02:31:21.760]  Whoops.
[02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:22.240]  No.
[02:31:22.280 --> 02:31:22.920]  Whoopsie.
[02:31:23.080 --> 02:31:23.560]  Um, but yeah.
[02:31:23.560 --> 02:31:26.960]  So forgive a shop if they don't have something that they did have
[02:31:26.960 --> 02:31:28.480]  advertised on their weed maps menu.
[02:31:28.480 --> 02:31:31.600]  But yeah, a good shop's going to keep that mostly updated, but you're
[02:31:31.600 --> 02:31:32.840]  going to want to call and double check.
[02:31:32.960 --> 02:31:33.360]  Yeah.
[02:31:33.680 --> 02:31:34.920]  Uh, something pro tip.
[02:31:35.200 --> 02:31:37.440]  I don't say pro tip ever, but if you want to sound like, you know
[02:31:37.440 --> 02:31:42.200]  what you're talking about, don't say CBDs say CBD.
[02:31:42.360 --> 02:31:42.560]  Yeah.
[02:31:42.560 --> 02:31:45.040]  It's cat boy, dog, or the initials.
[02:31:45.040 --> 02:31:47.800]  There's not an apostrophe S or S.
[02:31:47.840 --> 02:31:50.040]  The way I look at it, you don't say THCs.
[02:31:50.080 --> 02:31:52.000]  This strain has a lot of THCs in it.
[02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:53.840]  You say this strain has a lot of THC.
[02:31:53.840 --> 02:31:56.040]  Why would you say this strain has a lot of CBDs?
[02:31:56.040 --> 02:31:58.440]  In all fairness to the American public, like Sanjay gooped a
[02:31:58.440 --> 02:32:00.080]  fuck that up on his weed special.
[02:32:00.160 --> 02:32:01.000]  Oh, I didn't catch that.
[02:32:01.280 --> 02:32:03.400]  I didn't realize it was Sanjay that did that to us.
[02:32:03.440 --> 02:32:08.360]  No, it wasn't him that started it, but like it's a common mispronunciation or,
[02:32:08.440 --> 02:32:10.800]  or yeah, mispronunciation would be correct.
[02:32:10.800 --> 02:32:12.080]  Just CBD you guys there.
[02:32:12.280 --> 02:32:14.120]  You wouldn't say I want a glass of waters.
[02:32:14.160 --> 02:32:15.840]  You just say, I want a glass of water.
[02:32:16.080 --> 02:32:18.160]  And you know that there's a lot of water in there.
[02:32:18.160 --> 02:32:21.200]  There's a measurement with that contains a specific amount of water.
[02:32:21.360 --> 02:32:26.320]  And you're looking for CBD, not CBDs because it's not a group of things.
[02:32:26.320 --> 02:32:26.760]  It is.
[02:32:26.840 --> 02:32:27.800]  It's just one thing.
[02:32:27.920 --> 02:32:28.120]  Yeah.
[02:32:28.120 --> 02:32:29.040]  It's it's CBD.
[02:32:29.160 --> 02:32:31.440]  Um, and you don't, you don't say CHCs.
[02:32:31.840 --> 02:32:32.040]  Nope.
[02:32:32.280 --> 02:32:33.160]  You don't say corns.
[02:32:33.160 --> 02:32:34.000]  I want some corns.
[02:32:34.080 --> 02:32:35.040]  You say I want some corn.
[02:32:35.400 --> 02:32:36.280]  They don't eat cereals.
[02:32:36.320 --> 02:32:36.960]  You eat cereal.
[02:32:37.360 --> 02:32:37.880]  And I don't know.
[02:32:38.120 --> 02:32:41.880]  No, it's one of those things we hear that like Sadova and Indigo that when
[02:32:41.880 --> 02:32:45.560]  you're here, just cringe, we're going to do an episode in the future about Sativa
[02:32:45.560 --> 02:32:49.200]  and Indica and the differences and the benefits and balances and the growing
[02:32:49.200 --> 02:32:50.240]  styles and everything of each.
[02:32:50.240 --> 02:32:56.560]  So we'll talk about Sadova, Sadova and Indigo's Sativa and Indica, you guys.
[02:32:56.920 --> 02:33:02.320]  And, and phenotype P H E N O T Y P E phenotype.
[02:33:02.360 --> 02:33:03.760]  While we're on it, strain.
[02:33:04.160 --> 02:33:05.040]  Oh my gosh.
[02:33:05.040 --> 02:33:05.560]  You want to do that one?
[02:33:05.560 --> 02:33:08.840]  I saw a hilarious post the other day on social media that was like, I love all
[02:33:08.840 --> 02:33:11.160]  those 90% THC strands out there.
[02:33:11.200 --> 02:33:11.880]  Oh man.
[02:33:11.880 --> 02:33:14.040]  And I just about died laughing.
[02:33:14.040 --> 02:33:15.360]  Shout out to my boy Cooper Watts.
[02:33:15.360 --> 02:33:20.040]  He made a short educational video on the difference between strain and strand.
[02:33:20.360 --> 02:33:22.240]  Uh, strands are ropes or fibers.
[02:33:22.800 --> 02:33:26.200]  Uh, strains are different varieties of cannabis.
[02:33:26.200 --> 02:33:30.520]  If you want to be technical, you can call it a varietal or a cultivar, but let's,
[02:33:30.520 --> 02:33:33.800]  let's go with strain instead of strand as a start, you guys.
[02:33:34.320 --> 02:33:36.680]  And it's a trichome and not trichrome.
[02:33:39.640 --> 02:33:40.920]  I think we've gone on long enough.
[02:33:41.080 --> 02:33:46.880]  So one thing, the more, you know, bump bump bump, because knowing is half the
[02:33:46.880 --> 02:33:49.760]  battle, speaking of battle, that was a good segue speaking of battle.
[02:33:50.040 --> 02:33:54.680]  Uh, I wanted to talk about Nate Diaz from the UFC and UFC too.
[02:33:54.680 --> 02:33:56.560]  A segue GI Joe reference, right?
[02:33:56.560 --> 02:33:57.960]  It's an eight D there you go, bro.
[02:33:58.000 --> 02:33:58.400]  There you go.
[02:33:58.400 --> 02:33:59.280]  Real American hero.
[02:33:59.440 --> 02:33:59.640]  Yeah.
[02:34:00.680 --> 02:34:02.400]  Uh, I'm not going to talk about my opinion of the fight.
[02:34:02.400 --> 02:34:03.000]  That doesn't matter.
[02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:04.360]  But those dudes threw the fuck down.
[02:34:05.440 --> 02:34:06.440]  They went, they went to the end.
[02:34:07.080 --> 02:34:09.280]  It was, it was a, it was a decision.
[02:34:09.280 --> 02:34:10.760]  It ended with them both standing.
[02:34:10.760 --> 02:34:13.240]  So they beat the shit out of each other for 25 minutes.
[02:34:13.280 --> 02:34:17.680]  Fuck out of each other from the, the, I didn't see the fight, but I did see the
[02:34:17.720 --> 02:34:20.120]  press conference we're about to talk about and holy shit.
[02:34:20.120 --> 02:34:22.400]  He looked like a side of beef getting ready to hit the, yeah, yeah.
[02:34:22.400 --> 02:34:24.480]  He got punched in the face a lot of times.
[02:34:24.480 --> 02:34:25.960]  Conor McGregor has got some punches.
[02:34:26.440 --> 02:34:31.080]  Um, so one thing I want to talk about when they're interviewing him, dude, just
[02:34:31.080 --> 02:34:36.640]  straight pulls out a vape pen and starts taking vape pen rips and one of the, I've
[02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:38.200]  got the video here, let's just play this video.
[02:34:38.200 --> 02:34:39.480]  It's only a couple of seconds long here.
[02:34:39.720 --> 02:34:42.520]  I'm just gonna play this video and then we'll talk for a couple of seconds
[02:34:42.520 --> 02:34:43.760]  and we'll wrap up this podcast.
[02:34:43.760 --> 02:34:43.880]  But.
[02:34:44.200 --> 02:34:48.480]  But it kind of pulls out just so you guys know if you haven't seen the video, it's
[02:34:48.480 --> 02:34:51.920]  a, your standard, um, concentrate vape pen.
[02:34:52.440 --> 02:34:55.840]  Um, I've got a million different versions of this on the store shelf.
[02:34:55.840 --> 02:34:58.440]  I work at, I'm going to bring the volume up slowly.
[02:34:58.440 --> 02:34:59.680]  So I'm going to start back here.
[02:34:59.800 --> 02:35:03.000]  He hired all top 10 people to come in.
[02:35:03.480 --> 02:35:03.840]  Here it comes.
[02:35:03.840 --> 02:35:04.880]  Here comes the part we want to hear.
[02:35:06.360 --> 02:35:06.680]  Okay.
[02:35:07.160 --> 02:35:09.720]  Hey, what exactly are you just for the record smoking?
[02:35:12.080 --> 02:35:13.240]  This is true.
[02:35:13.840 --> 02:35:14.680]  It's true.
[02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:16.040]  The true company.
[02:35:16.040 --> 02:35:18.520]  It's a CBD.
[02:35:18.640 --> 02:35:23.400]  It helps with a healing process and, uh, inflammation and stuff like that.
[02:35:23.400 --> 02:35:27.400]  So you wanted to get these for before, after the fires training and
[02:35:27.400 --> 02:35:28.760]  make your life a better place.
[02:35:29.280 --> 02:35:32.920]  And then one last one, um, CBD, CBD oil.
[02:35:33.720 --> 02:35:36.760]  If you don't know what that is, a big part of this story.
[02:35:37.040 --> 02:35:37.480]  Do you hear that?
[02:35:37.480 --> 02:35:40.000]  The key right there, make your life a better place.
[02:35:40.200 --> 02:35:40.840]  That's what he said.
[02:35:40.840 --> 02:35:41.640]  I saw that.
[02:35:43.880 --> 02:35:44.600]  That's beautiful.
[02:35:44.800 --> 02:35:46.240]  That's I couldn't have said it better, man.
[02:35:46.240 --> 02:35:46.840]  I didn't realize it.
[02:35:46.840 --> 02:35:48.080]  I've watched this video several times.
[02:35:48.080 --> 02:35:51.240]  He fucked up where he said, uh, it's good to use before and after the fight.
[02:35:51.240 --> 02:35:53.440]  He shouldn't have said before the fight fucked up right there, buddy.
[02:35:53.480 --> 02:35:57.800]  But still, well, there there's, he might be in a ton of trouble for doing that.
[02:35:57.840 --> 02:35:58.160]  Yeah.
[02:35:58.200 --> 02:35:59.800]  That's what, that's what I wanted to talk about.
[02:35:59.800 --> 02:36:00.600]  I'm glad you said that.
[02:36:00.960 --> 02:36:06.920]  It's, uh, the specific rules, uh, bar cannabis consumption period.
[02:36:07.440 --> 02:36:13.880]  Um, until six hours after the fight, um, is what I was reading in
[02:36:13.880 --> 02:36:15.200]  random press coverage of this.
[02:36:15.200 --> 02:36:16.720]  I like, I don't follow the sports.
[02:36:16.720 --> 02:36:17.240]  That makes sense.
[02:36:17.240 --> 02:36:18.040]  And all of their rules.
[02:36:18.080 --> 02:36:21.720]  If you didn't catch that from my intro to this story, is that you saw to rules
[02:36:21.760 --> 02:36:27.680]  or is that rules from the local governing sporting agency was rules with an S in
[02:36:27.680 --> 02:36:29.440]  the news article I read is all I know.
[02:36:29.520 --> 02:36:29.840]  I'm sorry.
[02:36:29.840 --> 02:36:35.440]  I'm just, um, I almost said rules with a Z, but I honestly don't know, um, whose
[02:36:35.440 --> 02:36:39.640]  rules they are, but MMA fighters can't use any sort of cannabis product until,
[02:36:39.680 --> 02:36:43.640]  or any sort of banned substance, which marijuana or cannabis products would be
[02:36:43.640 --> 02:36:45.840]  on the list until six hours after the fight.
[02:36:45.920 --> 02:36:49.080]  I'm pretty sure I already know your answer here, but do you think a dude that
[02:36:49.080 --> 02:36:53.320]  just spent 25 minutes of his night getting kicked in the dick and punched in the
[02:36:53.320 --> 02:36:57.120]  face should be allowed to take a couple of rips off a CBD vape pen at the end of
[02:36:57.120 --> 02:36:57.440]  the night?
[02:36:57.480 --> 02:36:59.080]  Almost most assuredly.
[02:36:59.520 --> 02:37:02.640]  Um, I'd offer him a dad's dab of this wonderful half and half.
[02:37:03.320 --> 02:37:05.880]  He could dab all of this Graham that's left over if he wanted money.
[02:37:05.920 --> 02:37:09.760]  After beating like that, anything that's going to help you recover faster and deal
[02:37:09.760 --> 02:37:13.080]  with that level of trauma is encouraged by me.
[02:37:13.160 --> 02:37:17.200]  He says it reduces inflammation and swelling and that dude, that his face
[02:37:17.200 --> 02:37:18.680]  looks like a jack-o'-lantern.
[02:37:19.120 --> 02:37:19.520]  It did.
[02:37:19.520 --> 02:37:24.200]  And honestly, I, uh, I, I, I encourage or applaud his use of anything other than
[02:37:24.200 --> 02:37:27.000]  the heavy narcotics is what these guys are usually.
[02:37:27.400 --> 02:37:28.880]  Isn't that what they usually throw at them?
[02:37:28.920 --> 02:37:32.120]  You know, I don't, I don't know what they do to deal with the pain at the end of
[02:37:32.160 --> 02:37:34.520]  that, but, uh, Nate Diaz did make a joke.
[02:37:34.520 --> 02:37:38.160]  He said, I'm going to a party and, uh, Conor McGregor is going to the hospital.
[02:37:38.200 --> 02:37:41.160]  I don't know how accurate that was because Nate Diaz looked like he
[02:37:41.160 --> 02:37:42.320]  had his face punched in.
[02:37:42.840 --> 02:37:45.560]  Uh, I'm, I can't even talk about who I feel like won that fight.
[02:37:45.560 --> 02:37:47.120]  That doesn't matter at all on this podcast.
[02:37:47.440 --> 02:37:48.480]  Uh, that's not what we're here for.
[02:37:48.640 --> 02:37:49.000]  All right.
[02:37:49.040 --> 02:37:49.720]  I didn't see it.
[02:37:49.720 --> 02:37:53.920]  All I know is that, uh, Nate Diaz took a hell of a beating and that during the
[02:37:54.160 --> 02:37:56.040]  press conference, he was ripping a CBD.
[02:37:56.040 --> 02:37:56.400]  Yeah.
[02:37:56.680 --> 02:37:57.680]  Blatantly ripping it too.
[02:37:57.680 --> 02:38:00.320]  He looked to like two or three big fat rips off of it.
[02:38:00.880 --> 02:38:02.640]  Uh, so he didn't cough like I do.
[02:38:03.240 --> 02:38:03.560]  Yeah.
[02:38:03.600 --> 02:38:03.880]  Right.
[02:38:04.120 --> 02:38:05.080]  No, he took it like a champ.
[02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:07.200]  He doesn't smoke cigarettes all day, bro.
[02:38:08.160 --> 02:38:11.520]  Not, I thought that was the key to his success was tobacco.
[02:38:11.880 --> 02:38:14.120]  So I think, yeah, that's what makes him the MMA fight.
[02:38:14.160 --> 02:38:15.320]  It makes him tough as nails.
[02:38:15.680 --> 02:38:17.360]  Where the nickname Weezy comes from, right?
[02:38:17.400 --> 02:38:17.680]  Yeah.
[02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:18.920]  They call him young Weezy.
[02:38:19.960 --> 02:38:24.360]  So I feel like this dude should, I think, I feel like every athlete, I feel like
[02:38:24.400 --> 02:38:26.520]  almost everybody should be allowed to consume.
[02:38:26.560 --> 02:38:27.160]  See everybody.
[02:38:27.200 --> 02:38:27.600]  Why not?
[02:38:27.640 --> 02:38:29.960]  Let's look at everybody should be allowed to consume CBD.
[02:38:29.960 --> 02:38:31.560]  Weedekit was about last night.
[02:38:31.560 --> 02:38:37.400]  The, the new episode that aired was, uh, um, medical marijuana use in the NFL
[02:38:37.840 --> 02:38:41.800]  to deal with, um, the chronic concussion syndrome or whatever it's called.
[02:38:41.800 --> 02:38:42.560]  I know it helps.
[02:38:42.600 --> 02:38:44.640]  I'm, I'm a victim of a head injury.
[02:38:44.640 --> 02:38:48.240]  And I know that that's, we talked about that 42 minutes ago.
[02:38:48.320 --> 02:38:48.480]  Yep.
[02:38:48.800 --> 02:38:53.600]  That definitely, that CBD changed my life and it helped me get out of my funk that I had.
[02:38:53.720 --> 02:38:57.280]  I mean, the episode wasn't focused on CBD, but that's sort of what they were
[02:38:57.320 --> 02:39:01.120]  inching at is, or part of the story that we're telling was THC and CBD
[02:39:01.120 --> 02:39:02.400]  are both neuroprotectants.
[02:39:02.440 --> 02:39:06.280]  My next question was going to be, do you think that cannabis use is
[02:39:06.480 --> 02:39:08.840]  a performance enhancing drug?
[02:39:10.360 --> 02:39:11.640]  What's this performance?
[02:39:12.240 --> 02:39:16.120]  Um, fighting, kicking people, fighting UFC, fighting.
[02:39:16.120 --> 02:39:16.760]  How about football?
[02:39:17.320 --> 02:39:19.560]  No, not, not performance enhancing at all.
[02:39:19.640 --> 02:39:21.800]  How about injury recovery enhancing?
[02:39:21.920 --> 02:39:22.720]  How about basketball?
[02:39:22.760 --> 02:39:24.640]  No, no.
[02:39:24.640 --> 02:39:26.280]  I'm trying to play devil's advocate here.
[02:39:26.320 --> 02:39:27.240]  How about video games?
[02:39:27.600 --> 02:39:28.080]  Yeah.
[02:39:28.360 --> 02:39:28.680]  Yeah.
[02:39:28.720 --> 02:39:33.080]  I feel like when I smoke, uh, if I haven't played video games in a long time, um,
[02:39:33.120 --> 02:39:35.440]  there's a lot of things where I would put it on the yes list.
[02:39:35.440 --> 02:39:40.160]  But see then in my mind, since I am so comfortable, I've got ADD, my mind
[02:39:40.160 --> 02:39:42.680]  wanders, you can tell by listening to the podcast, my mind just fucking darts
[02:39:42.680 --> 02:39:44.000]  around all over the damn place.
[02:39:45.440 --> 02:39:48.000]  When I smoke some hash, it does help me focus a little bit.
[02:39:48.160 --> 02:39:50.800]  There's a moment there for the first fucking 10 minutes where my brain just
[02:39:50.800 --> 02:39:55.120]  spins, but once it lands back in its place, uh, I'm pretty well focused.
[02:39:55.160 --> 02:39:58.160]  And so, I mean, I've got mild ADD as well.
[02:39:58.160 --> 02:40:02.400]  And that's one of the things I've always enjoyed about cannabis is it helps, um,
[02:40:02.760 --> 02:40:05.200]  slow down the sporadicness of the thoughts.
[02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:06.280]  I feel like I can shoot pool better.
[02:40:06.280 --> 02:40:07.720]  I can shoot basketball better.
[02:40:07.720 --> 02:40:09.520]  I can probably, I don't play football.
[02:40:09.520 --> 02:40:14.760]  I could probably throw my football with more accuracy after I took a couple of dabs.
[02:40:15.320 --> 02:40:16.760]  Uh, I'm a musician.
[02:40:16.760 --> 02:40:18.880]  I've played drums for 20 years.
[02:40:18.880 --> 02:40:20.040]  I've had drum lessons.
[02:40:20.040 --> 02:40:21.000]  I've been on tour.
[02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:21.960]  I've played in big bands.
[02:40:21.960 --> 02:40:23.120]  I played in small bands.
[02:40:23.840 --> 02:40:26.480]  Sometimes smoking a little weed makes me play a little better.
[02:40:26.480 --> 02:40:29.120]  Sometimes smoking a little weed fucks me up to tell you the truth.
[02:40:29.120 --> 02:40:29.840]  So I don't know.
[02:40:29.840 --> 02:40:31.640]  Um, I definitely alters.
[02:40:31.680 --> 02:40:37.160]  Unless you're talking about like just helping the, the athlete or the performer
[02:40:37.160 --> 02:40:41.960]  tune out other distractions and focus on the competition in the moment.
[02:40:42.520 --> 02:40:46.560]  Um, I don't see it, you know, making you run faster and jump higher.
[02:40:46.560 --> 02:40:48.800]  And that's what I think of when I write a performance enhancer.
[02:40:49.120 --> 02:40:52.960]  In the UFC, yourself full of blood so that your, your heart can move more
[02:40:52.960 --> 02:40:55.000]  oxygen, like taking more testosterone.
[02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.240]  So I'm faster, meaner, leaner, quicker, right.
[02:40:57.280 --> 02:41:02.240]  A steroid so that you have more physical muscle mass, but like THC doesn't do any
[02:41:02.240 --> 02:41:02.400]  of that.
[02:41:02.400 --> 02:41:05.880]  It doesn't make me able to kick you in the face any harder.
[02:41:05.920 --> 02:41:07.560]  It doesn't make me give you more damage.
[02:41:07.560 --> 02:41:12.880]  It helps me recover from that face kick faster, but like, that's not a performance
[02:41:12.880 --> 02:41:13.360]  enhancer.
[02:41:13.360 --> 02:41:15.000]  That's a recovery enhancer.
[02:41:15.800 --> 02:41:17.480]  Like that's very different.
[02:41:17.800 --> 02:41:21.040]  Dude, if I was a UFC fighter and like, we're gearing up for the fight and the
[02:41:21.040 --> 02:41:22.760]  music's going and Rogan's all out there.
[02:41:22.920 --> 02:41:23.760]  Oh my God.
[02:41:23.760 --> 02:41:25.480]  This is the fight of the fucking night.
[02:41:25.480 --> 02:41:27.920]  Everybody in Rogan's just going nuts with his bald head.
[02:41:28.360 --> 02:41:29.320]  This is fucking too much.
[02:41:29.320 --> 02:41:29.960]  Alpha brain.
[02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:34.440]  Does your mouth have a little dab mouthpiece attachment?
[02:41:34.440 --> 02:41:35.160]  I'm a fighter, right?
[02:41:35.160 --> 02:41:35.960]  I'm a UFC fighter.
[02:41:35.960 --> 02:41:37.680]  I'm getting my, I got my fucking hand wraps on.
[02:41:37.680 --> 02:41:38.360]  I got my gloves.
[02:41:38.360 --> 02:41:39.440]  I got my tape coming on.
[02:41:39.440 --> 02:41:40.080]  I got my gloves on.
[02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:41.040]  I got my ankle wraps on.
[02:41:41.040 --> 02:41:43.600]  Cause I got these long chicken legs and they come out and they're like, Ross and
[02:41:43.600 --> 02:41:45.000]  Jeff, you got to fight in 30 seconds.
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:46.520]  You ready for your pre-show dab?
[02:41:46.800 --> 02:41:47.680]  And I'm like, let's get it.
[02:41:47.680 --> 02:41:50.520]  And they dropped me like a half a gram of some pineapple Jack Nug run
[02:41:50.520 --> 02:41:52.000]  shatter on there and I blow it out.
[02:41:52.680 --> 02:41:53.880]  You know what I want to do after that?
[02:41:53.920 --> 02:41:54.760]  Not fight.
[02:41:55.240 --> 02:41:58.080]  I don't know how these, how do you smoke?
[02:41:58.440 --> 02:42:00.440]  How do you medicate and want to fight at all?
[02:42:00.440 --> 02:42:01.280]  Well, no, I'm just.
[02:42:02.680 --> 02:42:04.640]  See, this is how little MMA I watch.
[02:42:04.920 --> 02:42:07.800]  Can you, you couldn't manipulate, no, you can manipulate the rig.
[02:42:07.800 --> 02:42:08.080]  Huh?
[02:42:08.120 --> 02:42:10.360]  Cause the, they need their fingers to grapple.
[02:42:11.560 --> 02:42:14.080]  I was thinking boxing style where you can't hold the ring.
[02:42:14.520 --> 02:42:18.320]  Like you've got one manager holding up the smoke, buddy, one manager holding up
[02:42:18.320 --> 02:42:20.800]  the rig, another manager working the nail on the carb cap.
[02:42:20.920 --> 02:42:21.280]  Yeah.
[02:42:21.640 --> 02:42:23.800]  Um, that seems complicated for a pre-fight dab.
[02:42:23.880 --> 02:42:26.920]  I would use one of those, uh, the hit man hinge nails with
[02:42:29.160 --> 02:42:30.000]  so you can do it with one hand.
[02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:30.880]  I can do it with my glove on.
[02:42:30.880 --> 02:42:31.720]  I'd figure this out.
[02:42:31.720 --> 02:42:33.560]  Do the announcers microphone comes down.
[02:42:33.560 --> 02:42:34.880]  Jeff's rig comes down.
[02:42:34.920 --> 02:42:38.440]  I am one of those guys that if there's a dab to be taken, I will make sure it
[02:42:38.440 --> 02:42:42.200]  happens, the dab diver, that's awesome.
[02:42:42.240 --> 02:42:45.080]  I'm glad we got to work the, uh, Nate Diaz clip into this episode.
[02:42:45.080 --> 02:42:45.640]  That was great.
[02:42:45.760 --> 02:42:47.440]  I saw that and I was so blown away.
[02:42:47.440 --> 02:42:49.440]  I was like, that's gotta be Photoshopped.
[02:42:49.440 --> 02:42:52.160]  And I clicked the volume on it and they start talking about it.
[02:42:52.160 --> 02:42:53.720]  And I was blown away.
[02:42:53.960 --> 02:42:54.160]  Yeah.
[02:42:54.160 --> 02:42:55.560]  He was super ballsy.
[02:42:56.160 --> 02:42:56.760]  Um,
[02:42:56.800 --> 02:42:58.920]  shout out to Nate Diaz for representing cannabis.
[02:42:58.920 --> 02:43:00.040]  And I mean,
[02:43:00.920 --> 02:43:02.520]  a tough decision loss too.
[02:43:02.560 --> 02:43:06.600]  He goes up all chest out proud to lead the way about medical cannabis and how
[02:43:06.600 --> 02:43:11.000]  beneficial he's in no way like politically correct or gentle.
[02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:12.520]  No, he's just boss to the wall.
[02:43:12.520 --> 02:43:14.800]  He's like, I just got kicked in the fucking head.
[02:43:14.800 --> 02:43:16.680]  I'm going to smoke some CBD to help it out.
[02:43:16.680 --> 02:43:17.360]  It's going to help.
[02:43:17.400 --> 02:43:18.200]  Don't be mad at me.
[02:43:18.240 --> 02:43:19.000]  I that's cool.
[02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:19.520]  I like that.
[02:43:19.520 --> 02:43:22.680]  But, uh, both of those brothers are going to end up banned from the UFC and
[02:43:22.680 --> 02:43:25.000]  banned from fighting for life if they keep playing the way that they do.
[02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.400]  And that's going to be terrible because I like to see their performances.
[02:43:27.760 --> 02:43:29.000]  Yes, you guys, it is random.
[02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:33.200]  I'm a dreadlocked hippie rust, a farian dude, but I love to watch some UFC.
[02:43:33.480 --> 02:43:34.320]  I think about it this way.
[02:43:34.520 --> 02:43:36.680]  Those dudes weigh 200 pounds and they're fucking jacked.
[02:43:36.680 --> 02:43:39.960]  They've got more testosterone and then their body than most people should have.
[02:43:39.960 --> 02:43:40.920]  And they want to break shit.
[02:43:40.960 --> 02:43:42.840]  I'm glad that they're in that cage, breaking each other.
[02:43:42.880 --> 02:43:45.960]  Then out at the bar or at the dab lounge, trying to break me.
[02:43:46.560 --> 02:43:47.920]  I condone that.
[02:43:47.960 --> 02:43:49.040]  Go to battle in that cage.
[02:43:49.040 --> 02:43:49.600]  Let's see it.
[02:43:49.640 --> 02:43:50.040]  That's cool.
[02:43:50.040 --> 02:43:50.640]  That's skill.
[02:43:50.680 --> 02:43:51.280]  Jiu jitsu.
[02:43:51.480 --> 02:43:55.200]  We've both known people who were just built to brawl.
[02:43:55.320 --> 02:43:55.820]  Yeah.
[02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:57.120]  That's just, yeah.
[02:43:57.120 --> 02:43:58.240]  Some people are here to drum.
[02:43:58.240 --> 02:43:59.560]  Some people are here to high five.
[02:43:59.560 --> 02:44:00.560]  Some people are here to brawl.
[02:44:00.600 --> 02:44:01.440]  We've all got our skill.
[02:44:01.480 --> 02:44:06.640]  Um, and it's good that they have an outlet and I'm a fan of MMA.
[02:44:06.640 --> 02:44:08.520]  I just don't care enough to pay attention.
[02:44:08.840 --> 02:44:14.000]  I think I am accidentally an MMA fan because of Joe Rogan and because of Joey
[02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.400]  Diaz and it all rubbed off.
[02:44:16.440 --> 02:44:16.560]  Yeah.
[02:44:16.560 --> 02:44:22.640]  It just rubs off too many Joe Rogan puts out the fight companion tour him and a
[02:44:22.640 --> 02:44:23.800]  bunch of his friends.
[02:44:23.960 --> 02:44:25.480]  And I also listened to fighter in the kids.
[02:44:25.480 --> 02:44:28.560]  So that's more MMA that gets pumped into my head, but they put out a fight
[02:44:28.560 --> 02:44:31.520]  companion where two guys from fighter and the kid and Eddie Bravo and Joe
[02:44:31.520 --> 02:44:34.960]  Rogan sit around and they watch the UFC and they talk about what's going on.
[02:44:34.960 --> 02:44:37.440]  And they drink beer and smoke weed and get fucked up and talk shit to each
[02:44:37.440 --> 02:44:41.400]  other, but they're watching the UFC and they tell you like in the match, they're
[02:44:41.400 --> 02:44:46.080]  like, all right, round three of this match, we were at 29, 28, 27 seconds.
[02:44:46.080 --> 02:44:48.840]  And you can sync up your computer and watch that video.
[02:44:49.120 --> 02:44:52.040]  And so it's almost weirdly like you're hanging out with Rogan and the
[02:44:52.040 --> 02:44:53.080]  crew watching the fight.
[02:44:53.480 --> 02:44:53.760]  I'll see.
[02:44:53.760 --> 02:44:57.800]  I'll watch it if it's on somewhere I'm at, but I don't like actively pay attention.
[02:44:57.880 --> 02:44:58.280]  Yeah.
[02:44:58.400 --> 02:45:02.040]  Um, I pay more, like if I'm over at your house and it's on the, it'll get more
[02:45:02.040 --> 02:45:04.000]  attention out of me than like football or basketball.
[02:45:04.200 --> 02:45:08.280]  I, uh, I took a little karate when I was a youngster.
[02:45:08.280 --> 02:45:11.400]  So I've always been fascinated with that type of skills to Kung Fu
[02:45:11.400 --> 02:45:12.560]  San Tzu for several years.
[02:45:12.560 --> 02:45:14.760]  And then Tong Soo Do karate for even longer.
[02:45:14.960 --> 02:45:17.360]  I was just impressed that he was repping CBD.
[02:45:18.120 --> 02:45:22.200]  Um, and I liked that he had a little CBD vape pen that was set up like an open or
[02:45:22.200 --> 02:45:24.120]  any of the other major vape companies.
[02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.080]  Um, just rip it on some CBD oil.
[02:45:27.440 --> 02:45:29.960]  Took like two or three good, maybe three or four good rips.
[02:45:30.120 --> 02:45:31.760]  All right, Mike, we've been rambling for almost an hour.
[02:45:31.760 --> 02:45:33.080]  I think it's time to wrap up this show.
[02:45:33.120 --> 02:45:33.560]  What do you think?
[02:45:33.560 --> 02:45:35.400]  Miss any other points on CBD?
[02:45:35.440 --> 02:45:37.960]  We covered his basic medical applications.
[02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:42.440]  Um, I crossed out all the stuff on my list, except popular CBD strains.
[02:45:42.440 --> 02:45:46.360]  So that if people wanted to grow cannabis, that was high in CBD.
[02:45:46.840 --> 02:45:49.440]  Um, just a few strains I would recommend anything.
[02:45:49.880 --> 02:45:56.800]  Uh, Harlequin, can a tonic, Harlequin, Taurus, Sue, Tora Bora, AC DC.
[02:45:56.880 --> 02:46:00.520]  The tour board is really wonderful folks that I've had a lot of personally.
[02:46:00.600 --> 02:46:02.200]  And I know I went over that list really quickly.
[02:46:02.200 --> 02:46:03.400]  Those were just off the top of my head.
[02:46:03.800 --> 02:46:07.680]  The other thing I'd like to touch on, I think before we wrap this one up is, uh,
[02:46:08.320 --> 02:46:12.480]  um, for at least for the pain and inflammation that I'm dealing with.
[02:46:13.160 --> 02:46:21.160]  THC and CBD together in roughly 50, 50 mix work two or 300 times better
[02:46:21.600 --> 02:46:24.480]  than CBD alone or THC alone.
[02:46:25.160 --> 02:46:27.680]  Um, the two of them together works.
[02:46:27.880 --> 02:46:29.640]  It's not one plus one equals two.
[02:46:30.280 --> 02:46:32.160]  Um, it's one plus one equals seven.
[02:46:32.240 --> 02:46:35.760]  As far as I'm concerned, um, the effect is amplified greatly.
[02:46:35.800 --> 02:46:36.000]  Cool.
[02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:36.560]  Last man.
[02:46:36.600 --> 02:46:40.320]  Um, no, it's wonderful when you, when you mix THC and CBD, the
[02:46:40.320 --> 02:46:42.080]  medical applications are wonderful.
[02:46:42.600 --> 02:46:47.280]  Um, sorry if I sound a little stoned and I am pretty tired, but, uh, I feel clear
[02:46:47.280 --> 02:46:50.040]  headed, I feel, um, like alert and present.
[02:46:50.520 --> 02:46:51.280]  We're going to fix that.
[02:46:51.280 --> 02:46:51.480]  True.
[02:46:51.480 --> 02:46:53.200]  When I got here, I was hurting so bad.
[02:46:53.200 --> 02:46:56.120]  I, uh, I seriously almost didn't come folks and I really like it.
[02:46:56.120 --> 02:46:58.080]  And I didn't almost didn't come because my head was pounding.
[02:46:58.240 --> 02:46:58.880]  I'm glad you made it.
[02:46:59.120 --> 02:46:59.880]  I'm glad you pulled through.
[02:46:59.880 --> 02:47:01.600]  I'm glad those CBD dabs fixed you up.
[02:47:01.640 --> 02:47:04.240]  I should've just started dabbing CBD earlier in the day.
[02:47:04.240 --> 02:47:07.160]  I just, I was out and about and didn't get a chance all day.
[02:47:07.240 --> 02:47:08.160]  That's how life goes.
[02:47:08.160 --> 02:47:10.920]  Sometimes you got to get home and get the dab rig going, bro.
[02:47:10.920 --> 02:47:14.000]  Remind everybody how they can follow you on social media and absolutely
[02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:15.760]  remind us about your Facebook page.
[02:47:15.880 --> 02:47:19.800]  You can catch me on Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws on Facebook.
[02:47:19.800 --> 02:47:21.720]  Give us a like comment, share.
[02:47:22.280 --> 02:47:23.840]  Um, we really appreciate that.
[02:47:23.840 --> 02:47:26.960]  We're, uh, reaching more and more people every week on that.
[02:47:26.960 --> 02:47:32.520]  It's, uh, I mean, the, the viewers that I get per week spike and change
[02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:36.920]  topic to topic, but, uh, as we've been getting close to the election, the
[02:47:36.920 --> 02:47:40.120]  view counts been going up steady and it's been nice and I like to think
[02:47:40.120 --> 02:47:41.480]  this show has something to do with it.
[02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.280]  Um, so if you're checking us out from the show, go ahead and
[02:47:44.280 --> 02:47:45.640]  send me a message, say hi.
[02:47:46.200 --> 02:47:49.880]  Um, or if you just want to hit me on Twitter, it's at Nemo punk 15 on
[02:47:49.880 --> 02:47:55.360]  Twitter and E M O P U N K one five, just like it sounds and, uh, yeah.
[02:47:55.400 --> 02:47:56.400]  Look forward to hearing from you.
[02:47:56.560 --> 02:47:56.720]  Yeah.

[02:48:00.600 --> 02:48:02.120]  Oh, I'm glad you liked the last episode.
[02:48:02.200 --> 02:48:02.880]  Fast Barry.
[02:48:02.880 --> 02:48:03.400]  What's up, buddy.
[02:48:03.400 --> 02:48:04.200]  Thanks for listening, bro.
[02:48:04.200 --> 02:48:06.120]  You've been listening to the podcast since the beginning.
[02:48:06.120 --> 02:48:07.000]  I appreciate that.
[02:48:07.040 --> 02:48:08.360]  And we see those messages, man.
[02:48:08.360 --> 02:48:08.880]  We appreciate it.
[02:48:08.880 --> 02:48:09.360]  Yes, we do.
[02:48:09.360 --> 02:48:10.800]  We see all of those messages.
[02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.720]  You guys, if you send me a message and I have not responded to your message yet,
[02:48:13.760 --> 02:48:14.400]  I'm getting to it.
[02:48:14.400 --> 02:48:14.800]  Trust me.
[02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:16.240]  We do one episode a week.
[02:48:16.280 --> 02:48:18.160]  I get 20 messages a week.
[02:48:18.160 --> 02:48:20.760]  I have tried to filter out my favorite or the most relevant for what's
[02:48:20.760 --> 02:48:22.120]  going on in our lives right now.
[02:48:22.440 --> 02:48:23.680]  That's how I handle the emails.
[02:48:23.920 --> 02:48:26.160]  So I'll be back with more episodes, with more email content.
[02:48:26.160 --> 02:48:29.480]  I love the listener generated content that lets me know that I'm getting the
[02:48:29.480 --> 02:48:31.680]  information to the people that need the information.
[02:48:31.680 --> 02:48:33.240]  I'm giving them exactly what they want.
[02:48:33.440 --> 02:48:34.280]  Makes me feel great.
[02:48:34.560 --> 02:48:37.160]  We, uh, we know way too much about cannabis folks.
[02:48:37.160 --> 02:48:43.200]  And we, I mean, we spend hours debating which little nugget of our, our vast
[02:48:43.520 --> 02:48:45.960]  cannabis intellect to share with the listeners this night.
[02:48:45.960 --> 02:48:49.560]  And it's, uh, when we have an email that's like, Hey, I was wondering how to
[02:48:49.560 --> 02:48:53.880]  blah it, uh, it sparks some awesome conversations.
[02:48:53.880 --> 02:48:58.040]  Some of my favorite episodes, man, our, uh, listeners with specific grow
[02:48:58.040 --> 02:48:59.320]  questions, absolutely.
[02:48:59.400 --> 02:49:01.480]  Um, we're able to dig in.
[02:49:01.560 --> 02:49:04.320]  I'll be going through the phone and I'll get an email and it'll say a show
[02:49:04.320 --> 02:49:07.640]  question and I'll read it and you can see me light up like, Oh yeah.
[02:49:07.680 --> 02:49:10.760]  Cause now I get to ramble for 45 minutes about one of my favorite things
[02:49:10.760 --> 02:49:11.920]  and it'll a whole bunch of bots.
[02:49:11.920 --> 02:49:13.600]  It always makes me good to get those messages.
[02:49:13.680 --> 02:49:17.720]  And honestly, from where we are in Colorado, especially here in Pueblo,
[02:49:17.720 --> 02:49:24.200]  it's hard to understand what you need to know now in Florida or Georgia or.
[02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:28.040]  Wherever you have in Australia, we have listeners all over the place.
[02:49:28.600 --> 02:49:33.680]  Um, and so you send it in a question that lets us know where you're at and how we
[02:49:33.680 --> 02:49:36.880]  can help you helps us clue in on the information to give you.
[02:49:36.880 --> 02:49:38.720]  And I absolutely love those episodes.
[02:49:38.760 --> 02:49:39.720]  There's so much fun to do.
[02:49:39.840 --> 02:49:42.600]  The last two email episodes were fantastic.
[02:49:42.640 --> 02:49:44.120]  I've got plenty more coming guys.
[02:49:44.120 --> 02:49:45.480]  Don't be afraid to send me some emails.
[02:49:45.480 --> 02:49:47.360]  Don't be discouraged if I haven't replied to you.
[02:49:47.680 --> 02:49:50.440]  I get so many messages that it's honestly overwhelming.
[02:49:50.440 --> 02:49:51.760]  Somebody told me to hire an intern.
[02:49:52.080 --> 02:49:54.680]  I said that that would be bullshit because it's all about talking to me.
[02:49:54.680 --> 02:49:55.920]  They don't want to talk to my intern.
[02:49:55.920 --> 02:49:57.160]  They don't want to pre-type dancer.
[02:49:57.160 --> 02:49:58.760]  They want to actually communicate with me.
[02:49:59.040 --> 02:50:00.040]  I do my best to do that.
[02:50:00.040 --> 02:50:01.040]  I try to keep up with it.

[02:51:34.600 --> 02:51:35.920]  And I've had Fox on a couple of times.
[02:51:35.920 --> 02:51:36.840]  Also we've done that.
[02:51:36.840 --> 02:51:37.040]  Yeah.

[02:51:48.920 --> 02:51:49.120]  Yeah.
[02:51:49.120 --> 02:51:51.080]  Well he lives in Denver now, so it's harder to get with him.
[02:51:51.440 --> 02:51:51.920]  Yeah.
[02:51:52.040 --> 02:51:58.560]  Um, but, uh, he's sort of the CBD, um, go to that I know of down here when I have
[02:51:58.560 --> 02:52:00.800]  a CBD question, that's who I send a message to.

[02:52:11.560 --> 02:52:15.040]  And until next time, take a fat dad and give your mom a hug for me.
[02:52:16.440 --> 02:52:17.920]  We used to aim for the sky.
[02:52:17.920 --> 02:52:21.280]  Now we hired him off the rise till we shine like the fire.
[02:52:21.280 --> 02:52:21.800]  Restore.
[02:52:22.640 --> 02:52:26.000]  I create you admire it all by the line from my rhyme.
[02:52:26.040 --> 02:52:26.680]  I'm a wire.
[02:52:26.680 --> 02:52:27.240]  You're John.
[02:52:27.240 --> 02:52:27.760]  Check it out.
[02:52:27.960 --> 02:52:28.400]  Linus.
[02:52:33.420 --> 02:52:40.820]  We did track elite world star at the numbers game is uncontained by a data
[02:52:40.820 --> 02:52:41.180]  sheet.
[02:52:41.380 --> 02:52:45.910]  I run the game on the shame with my love for fame.
[02:52:45.910 --> 02:52:47.270]  Cause my life was mundane.
[02:52:49.610 --> 02:52:50.370]  First place.
[02:52:50.370 --> 02:52:51.490]  And we move in the book.
[02:52:54.820 --> 02:52:55.380]  You speak.
[02:52:55.740 --> 02:53:04.850]  We can ruin your mom.
[02:53:04.930 --> 02:53:05.970]  So do it again.
[02:53:06.170 --> 02:53:06.530]  Do it.
[02:53:06.530 --> 02:53:07.610]  Then do it again.
[02:53:07.730 --> 02:53:11.860]  I go do it.
[02:53:11.860 --> 02:53:13.020]  Then do it again.
[02:53:13.180 --> 02:53:15.830]  With my friends.
[02:53:15.870 --> 02:53:16.270]  Yeah.
[02:53:16.430 --> 02:53:17.310]  You don't do it.
[02:53:17.390 --> 02:53:18.430]  You move with the trend.
[02:53:18.510 --> 02:53:18.910]  Yeah.
[02:53:18.910 --> 02:53:20.630]  Pretend you do it while I do it.
[02:53:20.630 --> 02:53:26.540]  It's a little probable and do it again.
[02:53:27.260 --> 02:53:33.680]  I'm the beginning true to the end in the lab, right?
[02:53:33.680 --> 02:53:37.440]  In theories of rhyme, clearly defined, dedicated, serious time.
[02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:40.120]  You can't see what you're weary to find.
[02:53:40.680 --> 02:53:42.800]  You can't copy what you hear me design.
[02:53:43.400 --> 02:53:45.120]  My whole life's a rhyme on the page.
[02:53:45.120 --> 02:53:49.280]  I'm kind of enraged that I've spent minimal time on the stage, but I don't
[02:53:49.280 --> 02:53:51.560]  want to play myself like some five minute craze.
[02:53:51.560 --> 02:54:00.480]  If I was a moment that he realized he sold out, but fuck depression.
[02:54:00.480 --> 02:54:01.600]  I ain't fixing to fall.
[02:54:01.760 --> 02:54:04.400]  I'm a come with progression and I'll give it my all.
[02:54:04.440 --> 02:54:05.280]  Do it again.
[02:54:05.480 --> 02:54:05.840]  Do it.
[02:54:05.840 --> 02:54:07.000]  Then do it again.
[02:54:07.160 --> 02:54:09.640]  Cause the moment that you stop is when the movement will land.
[02:54:09.640 --> 02:54:10.680]  So do it again.
[02:54:10.880 --> 02:54:11.240]  Do it.
[02:54:11.240 --> 02:54:12.320]  Then do it again.
[02:54:12.440 --> 02:54:14.360]  I give a fuck who the truthful event.
[02:54:14.520 --> 02:54:15.240]  Go do it.
[02:54:16.880 --> 02:54:17.720]  Do it again.
[02:54:21.110 --> 02:54:22.030]  You don't do it.
[02:54:22.110 --> 02:54:23.150]  You move with the train.
[02:54:23.310 --> 02:54:25.870]  You can pretend you do it while I do it again.
