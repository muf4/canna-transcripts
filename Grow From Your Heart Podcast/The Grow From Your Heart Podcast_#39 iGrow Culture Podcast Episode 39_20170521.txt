[00:00.000 --> 00:03.600]  All right. What's up, ladies and gentlemen, you have no idea what just happened at this
[00:03.600 --> 00:07.440]  table right now, but I wish I would have hit record about five minutes ago because some
[00:07.440 --> 00:10.760]  of that shit was priceless. Guys, welcome to episode number 39 of the I Grow Culture
[00:10.760 --> 00:14.440]  podcast. I'm your host, Rasta Jeff. Guess who I got back at the table, guys? Jesse's
[00:14.440 --> 00:18.320]  here. How you doing, brother? Hey, what's up, podcast land? Dude, you sound great on
[00:18.320 --> 00:22.360]  that microphone. We made a couple of tech adjustments. Sounds like I poured some Super
[00:22.360 --> 00:27.480]  Thrive into the mixing gear here. We got it going on. Adjusted the timing a little. Yes,
[00:27.480 --> 00:33.120]  we got a new muffler bearing in there. Everything's running quite smooth. So a couple episodes
[00:33.120 --> 00:37.440]  we talked about building a grow room and I got Jesse to come back and kind of wrap that
[00:37.440 --> 00:41.320]  up a little more for us, which ironically, he might have been working in a grow space.
[00:41.320 --> 00:48.800]  Yeah. Did you learn anything? 150 year old houses are 150 year old houses. Is it brick
[00:48.800 --> 00:54.520]  or is it like drywall and shit? It's brick. Oh, that's no fun. Yeah. Everything's brick.
[00:54.520 --> 00:57.840]  Guys, that's going to definitely come in handy in the talk later because I wrote some
[00:57.840 --> 01:02.240]  shit and it's all about building a room inside of a room and we're going to need to do that
[01:02.240 --> 01:07.200]  in Jesse space. It sounds like. But before we get to that part, let's pay some bills.
[01:07.200 --> 01:11.520]  This podcast is brought to you by our good friends at Cannabis Grand Crew. Cannabis Grand

[04:05.740 --> 04:09.940]  Yeah. See, I ordered that once and now they've got it on the shelf for me all the time.
[04:09.940 --> 04:10.940]  Heck yeah.
[04:10.940 --> 04:11.940]  Loving it.
[04:11.940 --> 04:17.180]  We also have a big old bag of Roots 707 for $25 this month.
[04:17.180 --> 04:20.940]  That's a steal and I might need to go stock up on that. That space right there along that
[04:20.940 --> 04:24.220]  wall that's empty, we could just fill that right up with soil.
[04:24.220 --> 04:30.820]  And also this month, if you mention Hygro Culture, you get commercial pricing on everything.

[04:36.740 --> 04:39.660]  When you're paying, tell them I listened to the Hygro Culture podcast. You will get
[04:39.660 --> 04:43.060]  commercial pricing. You're going to pay what Rasta Jeff pays.
[04:43.060 --> 04:49.180]  You can get that in Denver too. They may have to make a phone call. Tell them to call-
[04:49.180 --> 04:52.900]  Tell them to call Jesse or Burn in Pueblo and they'll get you straight down.
[04:52.900 --> 04:53.900]  They'll explain it all. Yeah.
[04:53.900 --> 04:57.740]  Yeah. Right on guys. Thank you. I didn't even know that was going to happen. So I just learned
[04:57.740 --> 05:00.820]  about that at the same time the listeners did. That is really cool.
[05:00.820 --> 05:04.220]  If we have a good response, we'll just probably keep it that way.
[05:04.220 --> 05:08.100]  There we go. Guys go in there and use that coupon code or that discount code so that
[05:08.100 --> 05:10.780]  we can keep it going. The more of you that use it, they'll see the response. They'll
[05:10.780 --> 05:14.500]  keep doing it. Awesome. Thank you guys for listening. Go in there.
[05:14.500 --> 05:18.460]  We got one more ad. Big love to TreeThugger.com. Of course, the show is brought to you by our
[05:18.460 --> 05:23.380]  friends at TreeThugger.com, live music lifestyle magazine. Check out TreeThugger.com for concert
[05:23.380 --> 05:30.140]  and festival news and reviews. www.treethugger.com.
[05:30.140 --> 05:33.780]  I think I actually just confirmed that I'm going to check out the string cheese incident
[05:33.780 --> 05:36.820]  in Denver on New Year's Eve. That's going to be kind of cool, kind of random for me.
[05:36.820 --> 05:42.220]  I haven't seen the cheese in years. Got a friend who needs a cheese buddy for New Year's
[05:42.220 --> 05:45.980]  and I think I'm going to be the cheese buddy. Quite a cheesy buddy. I think that's enough
[05:45.980 --> 05:50.300]  ads for the show. I think that covered everybody. Also check out naturesgreenremedies.com. I
[05:50.300 --> 05:54.060]  didn't do a big ad for them. They are sold out of iRegenetics products right now, but
[05:54.060 --> 05:58.220]  you can get Gage Green Genetics, La Plata Labs and Sin City. I do not have a coupon
[05:58.220 --> 06:02.140]  code for them this month. Once I give them a refill, they'll get a sweet coupon code.
[06:02.140 --> 06:08.180]  You guys will get hooked up. Currently, what's been going on? We had an election last night.
[06:08.180 --> 06:15.740]  Colorado did not have much cannabis initiative on the ballots, but we did have number 105
[06:15.740 --> 06:22.660]  regarding non-GMO food. This was the labeling of GMO foods. Colorado, dude, you failed,
[06:22.660 --> 06:29.100]  bro. What the hell? This was supposed to pass. We're not going to get too much into it because
[06:29.100 --> 06:34.580]  it's already happened. We wanted them to have to mark genetically modified food products
[06:34.580 --> 06:37.700]  with some sort of indication that it is genetically modified.
[06:37.700 --> 06:40.260]  Enriched with GMOs.
[06:40.260 --> 06:44.420]  We did not pass this. What the hell is going on, Colorado?
[06:44.420 --> 06:49.340]  It fell by a landslide. That's the really disappointing part.
[06:49.340 --> 06:52.900]  I liked your ... Jesse brought a really good Facebook post. He said something to the effect
[06:52.900 --> 06:57.940]  of that's okay, Colorado. I didn't want to share my organic produce with you anyway.
[06:57.940 --> 07:02.180]  Jesse's tomatoes are delicious. I am addicted. There's only one other place I've eaten recently
[07:02.180 --> 07:05.220]  that's got tomatoes nearly as tasty as Jesse's.
[07:05.220 --> 07:06.380]  I know where that place is.
[07:06.380 --> 07:09.420]  Dude, they get so many shout outs on this podcast. I'm addicted to that place. I eat
[07:09.420 --> 07:10.940]  there a lot.
[07:10.940 --> 07:16.980]  We went up there with Bernd and Bernd's cousin and they made customers.
[07:16.980 --> 07:20.740]  Yeah. They made friends. They treat you like your family when you're there.
[07:20.740 --> 07:21.740]  Oh, yeah.
[07:21.740 --> 07:24.020]  They know my name by now. They start writing down my order when they see me at mine. They're
[07:24.020 --> 07:27.140]  like, you want the same thing, dude? I'm like, yep.
[07:27.140 --> 07:37.460]  I've never seen that many Mare different drinks. I was a little overwhelmed at first.
[07:37.460 --> 07:41.100]  It's a little strange the first time you walk in. The vibe there is very unique. When you
[07:41.100 --> 07:43.300]  walk in, you're almost in a new world.
[07:43.300 --> 07:45.900]  Turn your cell phone off when you go in there, please.
[07:45.900 --> 07:51.020]  I agree, but there are so many people in there. I've gone late at night and midday. If you
[07:51.020 --> 07:55.660]  go during the day, it's 20 somethings with their MacBooks and their iPhones all over
[07:55.660 --> 08:00.060]  the place. You're right. Around 11 or 12, I wish we could get everyone to put their
[08:00.060 --> 08:02.260]  phones away and chill out because it's really chill in there.
[08:02.260 --> 08:06.460]  There were some people playing chess and a couple of people who looked like they were
[08:06.460 --> 08:08.540]  on a date or something. It's just real chill in there.
[08:08.540 --> 08:12.980]  The guys playing chess in there look like robots. They're so good at chess, dude.
[08:12.980 --> 08:18.440]  The one guy, I swear he was playing chess with the guy in front of him and then he was
[08:18.440 --> 08:22.340]  also playing it on his iPad.
[08:22.340 --> 08:23.660]  He's predicting what could happen.
[08:24.660 --> 08:26.660]  I was like, man.
[08:26.660 --> 08:31.220]  I've got a funny joke that only a few listeners are going to get. We're talking about a place
[08:31.220 --> 08:36.180]  called the Mate Factor and they make Yerba Mate. It's a Brazilian energizing tea. They
[08:36.180 --> 08:40.420]  have two different kinds. They have the dark Yerba Mate, which is what I prefer. Then they
[08:40.420 --> 08:46.900]  have got the green Yerba Mate, which I prefer the green iced and I like the dark hot. That's
[08:46.900 --> 08:50.100]  just my preference. If I need a cool drink, I'll get the green one.
[08:50.100 --> 08:54.740]  The guy was describing the differences to a customer who is in a really touristy area.
[08:54.740 --> 08:58.540]  They get a lot of touristy kind of people. They're describing this drink to a tourist
[08:58.540 --> 09:02.380]  and he said that the dark roast is the dried leaves that have been sat out and they've
[09:02.380 --> 09:05.540]  dried and they crumble it and then they brew it or they grind it and then they brew it
[09:05.540 --> 09:10.140]  together. He said the green is more of the fresh leaf that hasn't been dried and set
[09:10.140 --> 09:13.780]  out for as long. I heard him say that and I looked at the girl that was with me and
[09:13.780 --> 09:19.860]  I said, he's talking about that live res.
[09:19.860 --> 09:23.460]  I think a few listeners are going to laugh at that, but that's exactly the description
[09:23.460 --> 09:28.060]  that worked perfectly. It's all about that live resin. The dark roast is the dried and
[09:28.060 --> 09:32.020]  cured and then the fresh green is the live res and you can taste the difference. It's
[09:32.020 --> 09:33.020]  such a huge difference.
[09:33.020 --> 09:38.660]  Oh yeah. I had only ever had the green before I went up there and I got the dark and was
[09:38.660 --> 09:40.260]  like, yeah, this is the shit.
[09:40.260 --> 09:43.460]  All right. They don't know that this is going to happen, but if anybody that listens to
[09:43.460 --> 09:49.060]  this podcast goes to the Mate Factor in Manitou Springs, say something about you heard about,
[09:49.060 --> 09:52.420]  say, I heard about this place from the I Grow Culture podcast and they told me to say
[09:52.420 --> 09:56.220]  hi and then maybe they'll catch on because they know who I am. I've said that I'm the
[09:56.220 --> 09:57.220]  host of a show.
[09:57.220 --> 09:58.220]  Nice.
[09:58.220 --> 10:02.180]  Yeah. So maybe, maybe one day they'll, maybe I just want a free veggie wrap out of the
[10:02.180 --> 10:05.620]  deal. I got a free muffin from them the other night. They were really kind to give me a
[10:05.620 --> 10:10.420]  fresh warm free muffin. All right. That's a lot of talk about the Mate Factor. The place
[10:10.420 --> 10:15.180]  is so good, bro. If you go up there, go hike on Rainbow Falls. I never said nothing about
[10:15.180 --> 10:18.940]  the secret Rainbow Falls. That place is awesome. If you can find it, go hike it. It's cool.
[10:19.820 --> 10:26.420]  Graffiti Falls. So we're talking about the, uh, the votes that happened last night. Um,
[10:26.420 --> 10:31.700]  Oregon, Alaska and Washington DC have legalized recreational cannabis.
[10:31.700 --> 10:34.260]  Welcome to the cool kids club.
[10:34.260 --> 10:41.300]  Yeah. Florida on the other hand, you're just old people in Disney world still.
[10:41.300 --> 10:47.860]  How many people in Florida do you think could actually reduce their, like their, their pain
[10:47.900 --> 10:51.260]  medication consumption, uh, drastically?
[10:51.260 --> 10:56.260]  So do you think that maybe some of those pain companies, the pain clinics kind of lobbied
[10:56.260 --> 10:58.660]  against all of this medical cannabis or cannabis?
[10:58.660 --> 11:04.540]  No, surely not. I mean, I would think a big major corporation would have a lot more integrity
[11:04.540 --> 11:05.540]  than that.
[11:05.540 --> 11:07.980]  Good honest company that would need to do something like that because that would be
[11:07.980 --> 11:14.620]  kind of cheating and dishonest. Just poisoning their citizens. Nah, come on big pharma.
[11:14.620 --> 11:15.620]  Yeah.
[11:16.060 --> 11:20.180]  So if you, uh, if you did not go out and vote, you can't bitch about what happened in Florida,
[11:20.180 --> 11:23.940]  but if you voted in Florida and I'm sorry, you did not get your cannabis rights there.
[11:23.940 --> 11:28.540]  Oregon, Alaska and Washington DC. However, congratulations. Like that's awesome. Yeah.
[11:28.540 --> 11:30.380]  What are we going to say? I kind of cut you off.
[11:30.380 --> 11:34.060]  I was going to say, unless for some reason they're listening to this and they voted against
[11:34.060 --> 11:37.540]  it and then go fuck yourself.
[11:37.540 --> 11:44.340]  I will second that, but I will not pay the fine. Nobody's tallied up. How many times
[11:44.340 --> 11:48.700]  I said the F word on so many episodes. So whoever was paying attention, uh, you got
[11:48.700 --> 11:51.660]  to go math that up for me and we're going to discontinue that actually. We're going
[11:51.660 --> 11:54.780]  to stop doing it because I haven't said that in quite a long time on the show. So it's
[11:54.780 --> 11:57.180]  kind of cool. Somebody let me know what I owe and I'll pay it.
[11:57.180 --> 12:04.220]  I hit you on two for one episode, but I don't remember which one or when or where or anything.
[12:04.220 --> 12:07.420]  So dreadful J where are you girl? He always listened to the show and remind me of funny
[12:07.420 --> 12:12.260]  stuff that I said. So count up those F words. Uh, what else was I going to say? Washington
[12:12.260 --> 12:19.500]  DC, our nation's capital now has legalized cannabis. Why doesn't the rest of the nation
[12:19.500 --> 12:25.460]  just follow suit with what the capital has done? Yeah, I guess there are intelligent
[12:25.460 --> 12:31.300]  people in DC. Contrary to popular belief. Hopefully they'll change some of the, uh,
[12:31.300 --> 12:34.540]  their habits. Like while they're up there doing what they do instead of just droning
[12:34.540 --> 12:40.100]  on and be like, yo bro, I think that these GMOs are a crock of shit. We need to knock
[12:40.100 --> 12:47.420]  this shit out, bro. Can I get a I, and then everyone will be like, yeah, this just made
[12:47.420 --> 12:53.420]  a getting a, uh, smoking a joint in front of the white house photo op a lot easier.
[12:53.420 --> 12:57.860]  Ooh, well that's a, there was actually, I was at garden of the gods and I think I saw
[12:57.860 --> 13:01.740]  a sign that remind you, reminded you that that's a state park and you cannot bring your
[13:01.740 --> 13:07.100]  cannabis there. Yeah, because it's still federal land. So I'm pretty sure that that white house
[13:07.100 --> 13:12.180]  land is federal land and you can't have your cannabis there. Good point. Yeah. If you,
[13:12.180 --> 13:15.260]  uh, if you go to a state park right now in Colorado, people that are not from Colorado,
[13:15.260 --> 13:19.580]  this is a random, we did not prepare this part at all. If you're not, uh, if you were
[13:19.580 --> 13:27.140]  in a state park in Colorado, like red rocks is a state park. Uh, most, uh, the reservoirs
[13:27.140 --> 13:31.020]  like the Pueblo reservoir, all the big reservoirs where you'd want to go hang out. Most of the
[13:31.020 --> 13:35.780]  cool shit is a state park. You cannot take you, you can, I mean you can, they're not
[13:35.780 --> 13:39.820]  stopping everybody and checking it for you. Right. Yeah. We do, but we're not going to
[13:39.820 --> 13:43.060]  say we do, but you can take it. We're not encouraging. It's illegal to actually have
[13:43.060 --> 13:47.660]  cannabis at a state park. So yeah, even if it's legal in DC, smoking a joint at the Y
[13:47.660 --> 13:51.540]  white house is still going to be a little sketchy. Although shout out to Snoop dog claims
[13:51.540 --> 13:55.700]  that he smoked that weed at the white house there. And also a big shout out to Willie.
[13:55.700 --> 14:01.020]  We know Willie smoked at the way the white house. So, all right. So Bill Clinton smoked
[14:01.020 --> 14:07.580]  something there. Monica Linsky smoked something there. She just turned 50 recently and there
[14:07.580 --> 14:10.980]  were pictures of her online. I'm not going to comment on the pictures, but that did happen.
[14:10.980 --> 14:16.460]  Oh man. Doesn't that kind of make you feel old? I wasn't going to go there. I bet did
[14:16.460 --> 14:21.300]  come to cross my mind, but all right. We've been talking about, um, Jesse and I were talking
[14:21.300 --> 14:24.660]  about building a room a couple episodes back and we're talking about planning your grow
[14:24.660 --> 14:29.500]  room. We talked about selecting your space, uh, being a responsible grower. On this episode,
[14:29.500 --> 14:32.180]  we're going to talk more about building and setting up your grow. We're going to discuss
[14:32.180 --> 14:36.220]  grow tents a little bit or those hydro huts or whatever you want to call them. And maybe
[14:36.220 --> 14:39.900]  if we have enough time, we're already 15 minutes in. If we have enough time, I will try to
[14:39.900 --> 14:47.100]  tackle that $500 grow room question. That's going to be a challenge, but, um, basically
[14:47.100 --> 14:50.780]  do everything that we're doing and go much smaller. Dude, we don't even get to pots and
[14:50.780 --> 14:53.900]  soil and stuff on the stuff that I've got written and we've got five pages of stuff
[14:53.900 --> 14:59.380]  typed out. So this is going to be a lot. Um, we wrapped up the last grow episode with
[14:59.380 --> 15:03.820]  the talk about deciding how much light to use in your space. And we kind of talked about,
[15:03.820 --> 15:07.460]  uh, where you're going to hang the lights and where you're going to, my phone is making
[15:07.460 --> 15:13.500]  noise. That's a poor podcast move right there. Oh, it's already. Nope. Yeah, it was on silent.
[15:13.500 --> 15:18.220]  I don't know what that was. All right. Um, yeah. Talking about, we're going to hang the
[15:18.220 --> 15:20.600]  lights. How are you going to fit the humidity? We talked a little bit about bringing fresh
[15:20.600 --> 15:24.320]  air into the room. Uh, so now let's kind of talk about building a room, which is kind
[15:24.320 --> 15:29.160]  of helpful because Jesse has a lot of experience in this. Now you need to make a clean grow
[15:29.160 --> 15:33.240]  space that allows you to control the light cycles, the temperature during the day, the
[15:33.240 --> 15:36.920]  temperature during the night, and you need to control the humidity. And it's also ideal
[15:36.920 --> 15:41.080]  to have a lot of control over the air going in and out of the grow space. Uh, if you're
[15:41.080 --> 15:44.900]  using an extra bedroom or a closet, you'll have all the walls already built, but you'll
[15:44.900 --> 15:49.160]  need to work around the existing room. Jesse was talking about working in a brick building
[15:49.160 --> 15:53.360]  or a brick facility. I don't know where it is. I didn't ask. I don't want to know, but
[15:53.360 --> 15:56.640]  he was talking about it's 150 years old and it's brick and that's got to suck because
[15:56.640 --> 16:00.800]  you don't have a thing to screw shit into a bricks crumble. If you hit them with a hammer
[16:00.800 --> 16:05.400]  and try to put nails into them, chicken go really wrong. If you move one brick, now you've
[16:05.400 --> 16:10.280]  got that unstable wall. All right. So I'm ranting about a brick. If you've got an open
[16:10.280 --> 16:13.800]  area, like a garage or a basement, or maybe Jesse's brick area, you're going to need to
[16:13.800 --> 16:17.560]  build a room. You can't, you could just hang lights up in your garage or in that basement,
[16:17.560 --> 16:21.400]  but it's going to be a lot easier if you build a room or set up a free prefabricated
[16:21.400 --> 16:27.200]  grow hut, because that just gives you actually control over your environment and an environment,
[16:27.200 --> 16:32.120]  simple reflection and trapping the light and having it reflect around makes the light up
[16:32.120 --> 16:37.040]  to 30% more efficient is what I read in a couple of books. One said 21 said 30, how
[16:37.040 --> 16:41.560]  about we'll settle on 25% more efficient. And if you're running a thousand watt light,
[16:41.560 --> 16:47.400]  that's 250 Watts basically of efficiency that you're going to not lose by having more
[16:47.400 --> 16:52.240]  reflection. So just putting in a good designed room is already saving you money and increasing
[16:52.240 --> 16:56.880]  buds because like we talked about on another show, the light is the main nutrient for your
[16:56.880 --> 17:01.360]  plants. It's not what you pour in. It's not what you feed it. It's actually the light.
[17:01.360 --> 17:07.320]  So where are we? Let's let's actually get into building a room. I was looking at all
[17:07.320 --> 17:10.840]  kinds of stuff and trying to figure out how to do this. I just decided let's kind of build
[17:10.840 --> 17:16.240]  a four light room. We're going to act like we're building it either in a garage that's
[17:16.240 --> 17:21.080]  got plenty of room or the basement that's got plenty of room or maybe in a warehouse.
[17:21.080 --> 17:26.240]  Sorry about the cuffs guys. We've been taking dabs. So let's build a room. We need four
[17:26.240 --> 17:31.840]  1000 watt lights, an air conditioner, a way to remove the humidity and a way to draw in
[17:31.840 --> 17:36.840]  fresh air. So let's choose, like I said, we're going to do the basement or a garage or something
[17:36.840 --> 17:41.000]  like that that we want to build a four light room. I want to build a room that's good.
[17:41.000 --> 17:44.760]  How big is this room? That's what I was just going to say. Eight by eight, because two
[17:44.760 --> 17:48.760]  by fours come in eight foot sections, right? Two by three or whatever we decide to use
[17:48.760 --> 17:53.000]  a two by four. Well, you can get them in tens too. Okay. Yeah. But most of us aren't going
[17:53.000 --> 17:56.000]  to have a 10 foot ceiling in our basement or garage for sure. So I was going to just
[17:56.000 --> 17:59.800]  stick with the you can buy a bunch of eight by eights, a bunch of eight foot two by fours.
[17:59.800 --> 18:04.800]  And I think you could set up this room in a day. That'd be nice. Yeah. You and I could
[18:04.800 --> 18:09.600]  do it in probably five hours because we've done this enough times. So if you're going
[18:09.600 --> 18:13.840]  to use a grow hut or something or a pre-made grow lab, what do you guys do? You guys sell
[18:13.840 --> 18:19.560]  grow huts at the high over at hydro and or growing supplies. We have grow hut. We have
[18:19.560 --> 18:25.720]  a generic brand. Is it the grow lab? And we have the grow labs. Yeah. Okay. The generic
[18:25.720 --> 18:31.960]  brand is different than the grow labs. I've never seen one, but we can get a really good
[18:31.960 --> 18:36.480]  price on them. All right. And they're just basic, you know, I use the grow labs. Uh,
[18:36.480 --> 18:40.560]  that's what I have. They're grow lab one twenties or something like that. Or the five by fives.
[18:40.560 --> 18:44.440]  Those are sweeps. Same thing. I throw a thousand watt light in there and those are awesome.
[18:44.440 --> 18:49.280]  They also make a 10 by 10 one, which would work perfectly. Uh, for what we're going to
[18:49.280 --> 18:52.700]  talk about here, it would be, we're going to basically build an eight by eight version
[18:52.700 --> 18:57.480]  of that 10 by six, 10 by 10 feet by 10 feet by six high, I think, or seven high. We're
[18:57.480 --> 19:01.200]  just going to make an eight by eight by eight room. And one of the best ways to build a
[19:01.200 --> 19:06.280]  room, um, you know, even like a big, huge warehouse, what they do is essentially they
[19:06.280 --> 19:12.920]  build a gigantic grow hut out of two by fours and you know, drywall and everything. Uh,
[19:12.920 --> 19:19.600]  they'll build a room inside of a room, even in like the vertical, uh, uh, commercial lettuce
[19:19.600 --> 19:26.840]  farms and stuff like that. That's they, they start with these cells. So, you know, um,
[19:26.840 --> 19:31.280]  you need to, you know, sometimes looking at a 10 by 10, uh, a girl hut, they're kind
[19:31.280 --> 19:38.120]  of expensive, but so it was building a 10 by 10 room. And if you're not a, if you can
[19:38.120 --> 19:41.360]  build a 10 by 10, you can build this eight by eight room. You've got the tools and everything.
[19:41.360 --> 19:45.720]  I'll build us a house. Yeah. I don't have, I mean, I can, I've got basic skills, but
[19:45.720 --> 19:50.400]  for me buying the 10 by 10 hut and snapping those pieces together is so much easier for
[19:50.400 --> 19:54.720]  me. And if something were to go wrong in your grow, the thing comes down in an hour, you
[19:54.720 --> 19:59.600]  could have everything down concealed in one hour, uh, move it to another spot and put
[19:59.600 --> 20:02.680]  it back up hopefully in another hour with those grow huts.
[20:02.680 --> 20:06.880]  And if you're like working in a garage or a big open basement, I mean, you know, it's
[20:06.880 --> 20:11.700]  just if you want to expand and stuff like that, there, there's a lot of good reasons
[20:11.700 --> 20:16.440]  to have multiple rooms, uh, when it comes to pest control, uh, uh, equipment failure
[20:16.440 --> 20:21.520]  and all kinds of stuff like that. You know, it's good to double up. I agree completely.
[20:22.080 --> 20:25.960]  You get bugs over in this room or if you have an equipment and like you said, if the air
[20:25.960 --> 20:29.600]  conditioner fails in this room, it didn't fail in every room. It only failed in one
[20:29.600 --> 20:34.560]  light or four lights worth of stuff. You only murdered 30 plants instead of a hundred. All
[20:34.560 --> 20:38.600]  right. So I'm glad Jesse said that part about building a room within a room. Uh, he comes
[20:38.600 --> 20:42.640]  in handy sometimes. Cause most of what I wrote was about building a room inside of a room.
[20:42.640 --> 20:45.960]  I was going to say frame out an eight by eight room. That's nice and tall. I was going to
[20:45.960 --> 20:49.200]  say, try to leave as much headroom as you can, but most of us are going to be in a basement
[20:49.200 --> 20:53.040]  or garage. So we'll be limited on space. And then I said, if you can use the full,
[20:53.040 --> 20:56.480]  uh, eight foot two by four zero in good luck. So frame out your eight by eight by eight
[20:56.480 --> 21:00.800]  room wherever you're working. And then here's where I kind of start getting into detail
[21:00.800 --> 21:04.080]  since Jesse kind of, I'm so glad you said build a room inside of a room. Cause that's
[21:04.080 --> 21:10.240]  always, most of what I wrote is build a room inside of a room, even like a big, like restaurants
[21:10.240 --> 21:14.400]  and old buildings and stuff like that. That's how they, you know, make it sanitary, make
[21:14.400 --> 21:19.320]  it look all nice. Just build a shell. It's called over framing. All right. So overframe
[21:19.320 --> 21:22.520]  yourself a nice room. All right. You got an eight by eight room just framed. You don't
[21:22.520 --> 21:27.520]  need to frame it like super rigidly secure. You just need a couple of cross beams. Yeah.
[21:27.520 --> 21:33.920]  24 inch studs every 24 inches. So have Jesse or I stand every 24 inches is what he said.
[21:33.920 --> 21:39.960]  You need to stud every 24 inches plan for a door. Sometimes you guys forget doors. Uh,
[21:39.960 --> 21:43.920]  the hydro shop sell. I don't know if you guys have this yet, but I've seen this at plenty
[21:44.440 --> 21:47.880]  of places. Okay. It's like a sticker. You stick it right on your, on the Mylar. We're
[21:47.880 --> 21:50.800]  going to talk or not the Mylar, the poly we're going to talk about later. And then he has
[21:50.800 --> 21:54.520]  a razor and you unzip the zipper. And as you unzip it, you just follow your razor right
[21:54.520 --> 21:58.680]  along with it and cut a hole in the poly. And now you have a zippered door. Do not unzip
[21:58.680 --> 22:05.120]  it before you stick it on. Has that happened? Okay. We're just going to move on because
[22:05.120 --> 22:08.680]  we don't want to make fun of your customer that did that. Uh, you're going to need to
[22:08.680 --> 22:12.080]  put some beams across the top to hang your equipment. So now you've got this eight by
[22:12.240 --> 22:18.000]  eight building, just, just a frame, um, studs every 24 inches, maybe a couple of cross.
[22:18.000 --> 22:23.240]  Cause you're going to hang some equipment, uh, the, uh, roof beams. Well, depending on
[22:23.240 --> 22:28.520]  if you go all the way to the, to the ceiling, um, if you don't go all the way to the ceiling,
[22:28.520 --> 22:34.360]  um, just stand your, don't lay them down, stand your two by fours up on the skinny edge.
[22:34.360 --> 22:41.240]  Um, get you some metal clamps and screw them to the top of two walls and it'll help support
[22:41.400 --> 22:45.960]  the brace, everything. You can hang lights from it, all kinds of neat shit. That's why
[22:45.960 --> 22:50.840]  we brought Jesse. That's why you say, that's why you pan the big bucks. So once everything's
[22:50.840 --> 22:55.520]  framed up, uh, you can insulate the room with the blue insulation boards. If you want to
[22:55.520 --> 22:59.840]  make it more soundproof and more, uh, have more stable temps. I don't find that to be
[22:59.840 --> 23:03.480]  too necessary. If you're in a basement, if you're in the garage, maybe cause it's going
[23:03.480 --> 23:08.080]  to get colder in the winter and hotter in the summer. But the basement, like we talked
[23:08.080 --> 23:12.640]  about stays fairly cool. Most of the time, uh, some people choose to use plywood or some
[23:12.640 --> 23:16.520]  type of board on the walls, whatever you want as cool, build it how you like at that point.
[23:16.520 --> 23:21.180]  But once you've decided on the walls and insulation, that's when we hang a, we call it Polly or
[23:21.180 --> 23:26.160]  Panda film. Uh, Polly is basically plastic sheeting. That's white on one side and black
[23:26.160 --> 23:31.320]  on the other. Now you hang the white side on the inside of the room and the black side
[23:31.320 --> 23:35.080]  on the outside of the room. Uh, it'll, the white will keep the reflection of your light
[23:35.080 --> 23:39.320]  in there and give you more efficiency. Uh, you need to cover up the whole room, the
[23:39.320 --> 23:43.080]  walls, the floor and the ceiling and seal it up with tape. Seal up any spots where bugs
[23:43.080 --> 23:48.160]  can get in, uh, any spots where light can get out. You want it to be a little fortress.
[23:48.160 --> 23:53.480]  That's its own private little room. You want to seal that shit up. And the more time you
[23:53.480 --> 23:58.320]  take in the tighter, you get all the plastic and everything. There's less of a spot for,
[23:58.320 --> 24:03.320]  um, bugs to get and stuff like that. Take your time with this. Take your time with it.
[24:03.320 --> 24:07.120]  Uh, if you can, if you have a little bit of overlap everywhere, there's some kind of
[24:07.120 --> 24:10.800]  gap. That's a good idea. When you're putting your staples in, put down a little square
[24:10.800 --> 24:15.600]  of duct tape and then the staple. Yeah, because that'll help from the Polly tearing and it'll
[24:15.600 --> 24:20.880]  also keep the staple in a little bit better. You can also go back and take a, a little
[24:20.880 --> 24:29.800]  bit of silicone caulking and, uh, um, stick that right over the staple. Had to make sure
[24:29.800 --> 24:34.600]  I got that dough in there. You don't want to have your cock out in the grow room. Yeah.
[24:34.600 --> 24:37.880]  All right. So now you've basically built a little grow hut. Like we were talking about.
[24:37.880 --> 24:42.080]  Um, most of what we're going to talk about now works in the grow huts and it translates,
[24:42.080 --> 24:44.920]  that kind of translates to if you're just working with the bedroom. Also, if you'd haven't
[24:44.920 --> 24:49.080]  built a room, the main difference is you won't have the buffers on around the grow area.
[24:49.080 --> 24:51.800]  If you're in a bedroom, you'll need to vent out of the room or the house without anybody
[24:51.800 --> 24:56.080]  noticing. Uh, the room that we've built inside of the rooms gives you more privacy and I
[24:56.080 --> 25:01.320]  feel like a little bit more control. Should we, uh, go over a bedroom, uh, how to vent
[25:01.320 --> 25:07.520]  out a window real, see, uh, snazzy, like real quick. I think I talk a little bit about it.
[25:07.520 --> 25:13.080]  Um, yeah, we can talk about it. And if, when I get to it later on, we'll just skip it later.
[25:13.080 --> 25:19.160]  Okay. So crack your window open. Um, half inch inch kind of depends on how much airflow
[25:19.160 --> 25:25.520]  you need through it. Uh, and then screw it shut. Um, or at least screw it to where it
[25:25.520 --> 25:31.800]  can't be opened any further. And you do that by a real gently running a nice three inch
[25:31.800 --> 25:38.480]  screw through the, uh, most people have vinyl windows, um, through the, the inside, uh,
[25:38.480 --> 25:42.160]  track of where the window goes up and down. That'll hold the window shut, keep someone
[25:42.160 --> 25:47.760]  from ripping it open. Then you take your, your window blinds, get you a nice new set
[25:47.760 --> 25:53.400]  of mini blinds, cheap ones, um, throw that down, close them so that, you know, no light
[25:53.400 --> 25:59.520]  can go through. Um, maybe leave them open a quarter inch at the bottom. Uh, air will
[25:59.520 --> 26:05.400]  still suck through it pretty, pretty good. Um, and then take Panda film, put the white
[26:05.400 --> 26:10.400]  side to the outside of the window, staple it over that, and then take you a piece of
[26:10.400 --> 26:17.160]  plywood, screw it up over the wall and you can cut holes and mount, uh, mount fans on
[26:17.160 --> 26:21.480]  there and all your ducting and everything. There you go. Yeah. So you can use one window
[26:21.480 --> 26:27.200]  as an intake and one windows and exhaust. Have you ever done the thing where you, uh,
[26:27.200 --> 26:31.140]  put the blinds up just like you said you, uh, I would close the window or leave it open
[26:31.140 --> 26:33.960]  just a little bit. Okay. We've got to leave it open for what we're doing on this one.
[26:33.960 --> 26:39.200]  Sorry. Too many ideas in my head. Uh, you leave the half inch gap and then you build
[26:39.200 --> 26:44.280]  basically a box around the window. So you take some plywood and you make like three
[26:44.400 --> 26:49.000]  inch deep little square around the, the, like an inch around the window. And then you put
[26:49.000 --> 26:53.000]  a piece of plywood over that and then you can put all your ducting in that plywood.
[26:53.000 --> 26:56.260]  And it almost looks like you could put like a Christmas slide or a candle light or something
[26:56.260 --> 26:59.280]  in there. And it looks like somebody's home all the time. And it just makes it look like
[26:59.280 --> 27:04.420]  you got a light and it's like, it's the room and then you can actually use that as ducting
[27:04.420 --> 27:08.760]  and shit too now. Cause it's open. I did one, I actually stuck a Christmas light in there,
[27:08.760 --> 27:13.480]  a yellow one, and it reflected off all the plastic and everything enough to, you know,
[27:13.480 --> 27:15.760]  you could just flip it on as a little timer and everything.
[27:15.760 --> 27:19.360]  And then now you've got a window open and it looks like somebody's home. You got a light
[27:19.360 --> 27:22.400]  on in there and it looks like it's just part of the normal. Yeah. So if you're,
[27:22.400 --> 27:24.880]  I have no idea why we would need to be that secretive.
[27:24.880 --> 27:31.160]  You know, it's mostly, uh, I'm not worried as worried about the police as I am about the
[27:31.160 --> 27:35.560]  thieves. I actually heard a story about some thieves getting into somebody's air. They went
[27:35.560 --> 27:39.120]  in through their house, through the air conditioning duct and we're taking their
[27:39.120 --> 27:44.200]  plants while the people were home. Wow. They found out, and I shouldn't even be talking
[27:44.200 --> 27:49.440]  about this cause that whatever, but, uh, the people found out their plants were being stolen
[27:49.440 --> 27:52.800]  because of the cops knocked on the door and found kids running out their backyard with
[27:52.800 --> 27:58.360]  pot plants. Oh God. Yeah. Right. I don't know how that story ended. I bailed on that conversation.
[27:58.360 --> 28:03.760]  Yeah. Scary shit. All right. So I hope my story about building the box around the window
[28:03.760 --> 28:07.040]  makes sense. It's, I kind of had a vague idea of how to do that in my head. I was thinking
[28:07.040 --> 28:11.920]  too many thoughts. So you take a, just shape the size of the window, you add an inch square.
[28:11.920 --> 28:16.600]  So now if your window is 24 by 24, you make a 25 by 25 square piece of plywood and then
[28:16.600 --> 28:20.400]  you make a freaking box out of it. You know what I mean? Like a half box. So it's only,
[28:20.400 --> 28:24.080]  you only need it three inches deep, make a little tray and then put that up against the
[28:24.080 --> 28:28.280]  window and then you can put a curtain and just make it look like it's a real window.
[28:28.280 --> 28:31.840]  Yeah. It works. You guys can math that out in your brain. I hope, sorry, I wrote a bunch
[28:31.840 --> 28:36.520]  of shit and that's not on all my notes. You're just messing with my brain, man. Let's see.
[28:36.520 --> 28:43.360]  Where was I on all these papers? I hate, uh, I hate sloppy, uh, windows. Um, I've actually
[28:43.360 --> 28:47.640]  seen a few houses around town and drive around and you're like, Oh yeah, there's one. I know
[28:47.640 --> 28:51.440]  what that is. I know. Yeah. There's, there's actually two that I can drive to right now
[28:51.440 --> 28:56.400]  and be like, grow house right there. You can always see a metal halide in the attic. All
[28:56.400 --> 29:02.760]  right. So hang that poly real carefully. Like Jesse said, take your time with the poly.
[29:02.760 --> 29:06.160]  This is the building of the room. These are your walls. You wouldn't build your house
[29:06.800 --> 29:11.720]  walls. All shitty. You want your plant room? Nice. Um, cover the whole room, seal it up,
[29:11.720 --> 29:15.680]  seal any spots where shit can get in. Now we basically, you got that little grow hut.
[29:15.680 --> 29:18.840]  We're talking about a bedroom. I think I already did most of what the part I'm talking about.
[29:18.840 --> 29:22.520]  Um, or privacy. So now you've got the room built and sealed up. If you're going to use
[29:22.520 --> 29:26.880]  a bedroom, make sure to clean and dust the bedroom first. Get your on liner. Oh yeah.
[29:26.880 --> 29:30.040]  Yeah. That's definitely on my list of shit. Uh, cover the windows where the light can
[29:30.040 --> 29:35.040]  get in or get out. Cover any cracks. If you've got cracks in the walls, cover those, uh,
[29:35.040 --> 29:38.200]  cover all your walls in the bedroom with reflective material. The Panda film works
[29:38.200 --> 29:42.760]  in a bedroom. Also pull up the carpet. If you have that option, cover the floor if possible.
[29:42.760 --> 29:47.480]  And right here I wrote, I like a pond liner for my floor. Um, I like to get the pond liner
[29:47.480 --> 29:52.320]  about three to four inches up the wall all the way around the room. So if you do accidentally
[29:52.320 --> 29:56.160]  flood your resin that room or you spill a bucket or something, that's cool. You just
[29:56.160 --> 30:01.160]  got a pond liner there to catch it all. And in the doorway there, uh, to help keep the
[30:01.160 --> 30:07.840]  doorway all sealed up, just cut you a door, a two by four, um, as wide as your doorway,
[30:07.840 --> 30:13.080]  stand it up on the outside and screw it in place. And then that's a place to staple your
[30:13.080 --> 30:19.320]  pond liner too. So in terms of a little bedroom into a pond, you know, you're gonna have to
[30:19.320 --> 30:22.760]  step up when you go in and out, but you know, big deal. I like the way you did that. Cause
[30:22.760 --> 30:28.200]  I did it kind of a shitty way in my, my newest build. It works, but I didn't do it that smooth.
[30:29.200 --> 30:34.840]  This guy's awesome. A nice little air seal. If you put it real tight and everything, put
[30:34.840 --> 30:38.240]  a piece of foam in there. And that's something we're going to talk a little bit about because
[30:38.240 --> 30:42.960]  some of us are going to have to use that crevice underneath the door to let air in. Yeah, true.
[30:42.960 --> 30:46.600]  That's actually a pretty good spot if for some of us. And that's guys, everything I'm
[30:46.600 --> 30:52.680]  talking about is, uh, under ideal conditions. Yeah, this, I mean, there's, I'm just trying
[30:52.680 --> 30:56.780]  to throw out ideals out there cause there's so many ways you could use, I mean, and so
[30:56.820 --> 31:01.940]  much that different scenarios. And if you walked into, okay, this is a four bedroom
[31:01.940 --> 31:05.100]  house. If we walked into all four bedrooms and tried to build a grow room in it, we'd
[31:05.100 --> 31:08.980]  have to deal with different obstacles in every single room. Each room would have different
[31:08.980 --> 31:13.300]  shit to deal with. That room's only got a window on that side, that room. You can't
[31:13.300 --> 31:17.100]  mess with the window cause it's right up against the neighbor's house. If you exhaust out there,
[31:17.100 --> 31:22.100]  you're going to be blown into the neighbor's window basically. So there'd be some obstacles.
[31:22.100 --> 31:25.580]  Yeah. All right. So wherever you are, you're going to have to deal with some shit. Everything
[31:25.580 --> 31:29.100]  we're saying is just kind of kind of hopefully going to work for what we're doing. So now
[31:29.100 --> 31:32.740]  we've got this clean room. Basically we've got a hut that's sealed up. Uh, we're going
[31:32.740 --> 31:37.700]  to add, so you get your eight by eight by eight room. It's all Panda filmed or you've
[31:37.700 --> 31:41.660]  got a 10 by 10 grow hut or whatever. Something similar. Uh, now this is where you want to
[31:41.660 --> 31:45.860]  add an intake and an outtake. Uh, I talked in that last episode a lot about how important
[31:45.860 --> 31:50.340]  it is to vent you the air in your grow. I like those inline style fans or blowers. I
[31:50.340 --> 31:55.500]  like the vortex vortex has always been reliable. The can fan is great. They're a little more
[31:56.420 --> 32:00.140]  expensive, but they're adjustable speed and dude, those are reliable. Uh, those green
[32:00.140 --> 32:04.380]  hard hydro farm blowers, those are reliable. They work, but they're loud. Yeah, they're
[32:04.380 --> 32:11.380]  really loud and they're the green hydro farm inline boosters are junk. All right. Yeah.
[32:11.380 --> 32:16.460]  Don't waste your money on them. Jesse works at a hydro shop and I was not going to bash
[32:16.460 --> 32:20.180]  any brand, but since he works there and has to order from them, we'll let him go ahead
[32:20.180 --> 32:27.180]  and talk shit. Yeah. I mean, it is what it is. There's a reason they sell, uh, um, so
[32:28.100 --> 32:32.820]  many refurbished ones of those. That's a lot of growth stores. We'll get the, uh, hydro
[32:32.820 --> 32:38.300]  farm. I just better shut up. Yeah. All of what he says is allegedly, and I am not responsible
[32:38.300 --> 32:42.780]  for that. I like, uh, for, for the room we're going to build, we need an eight inch blower.
[32:42.780 --> 32:47.340]  Um, I'm going to say, get a can fan or a vortex and don't buy one of the green hydro farm
[32:47.340 --> 32:54.340]  ones. Get a, um, if you can afford the can fan, get that the vortex is ideal next. So
[32:54.340 --> 32:59.820]  that, yeah, the hydro farm blowers are great. It's the, the boosters, the ones that go in
[32:59.820 --> 33:04.020]  the ducting. Yeah. Those are all crap. No matter who makes them. Those are all crap.
[33:04.020 --> 33:11.020]  I think can fans isn't bad, but it's, that's not a primary fan. It's a booster on the box.
[33:11.660 --> 33:16.340]  So, okay. All right. Yeah. If you get the right blower, you don't need the booster.
[33:16.340 --> 33:20.060]  So add that, uh, let's see, where were we? Eight inch blower, attach the blower, uh,
[33:20.060 --> 33:23.540]  to the framing and get it fairly high in the room. Depending on where you are. Some of
[33:23.540 --> 33:26.260]  you guys might need to do this in the dead center of the room. Some of you may need to
[33:26.260 --> 33:30.260]  do it off to a corner. Just try to get it high. Uh, I think it's better to get the heat
[33:30.260 --> 33:36.620]  high. It's better to dump it out of the room. High. I like to do everything high. All right.
[33:36.620 --> 33:39.900]  So now this is when you need to decide if you're going to use a vented hoods or open
[33:39.900 --> 33:44.660]  hoods. Uh, vented hoods are the ones, uh, just for the people that are new with this,
[33:44.660 --> 33:48.460]  they're light reflectors and hoods. Vented ones mean they have glass on the bottom and
[33:48.460 --> 33:52.540]  they're sealed and your ducting will attach to it. And the light will be moved away from
[33:52.540 --> 33:57.060]  the grow and not dropping down onto your plants. If you have open hoods, you're going to have
[33:57.060 --> 34:02.220]  to have more air conditioning, but you don't have to have as much ducting. So that's when
[34:02.220 --> 34:06.020]  you need to think about what you got to do. You get more value for your, for your life
[34:06.020 --> 34:12.060]  that way. But air conditioning is expensive, right? I like the vented style. Yeah. That's
[34:12.220 --> 34:16.180]  pretty much industry standard. I'd say. Yeah. Unless you're in, uh, I've actually seen a
[34:16.180 --> 34:23.180]  couple of huge rooms that just dump AC at ridiculous levels and it's, yeah. But if you're
[34:24.260 --> 34:28.180]  supplementing CO2 and stuff, you can't be exhausting a lot. Yeah. It takes a little
[34:28.180 --> 34:34.300]  bit more work. Um, and if you're really cool kids, you got the Govitas or the Nano Luxes
[34:34.300 --> 34:39.020]  or something like that. Oh yeah. Those Govitas, you can't duct those. So then you're going
[34:39.020 --> 34:43.140]  to have, okay. So if you're using Govitas, you're going to have to use more air conditioning.
[34:43.140 --> 34:47.300]  A lot more. All right. So if you're using open hoods and you're trying for the ducting
[34:47.300 --> 34:51.960]  situation we're doing, you can just attach a carbon filter to your eight inch blower.
[34:51.960 --> 34:57.660]  And now you've pretty much finished the extraction. But if you're using, uh, make sure you use
[34:57.660 --> 35:00.500]  the carbon filter. Also, that's what I want to add. Make sure you're using the carbon
[35:00.500 --> 35:04.900]  filter on the extraction fan. Your crop is going to stink like about week six. You're
[35:04.900 --> 35:08.700]  going to be able to smell everything. I just hit week five in the middle of week five in
[35:08.700 --> 35:15.140]  a room and that, uh, that Gorilla Glue number four is a stinky little bitch. Oh my God.
[35:15.140 --> 35:19.420]  So if you do use vented hoods, you got to run ducting. We're running four lights in
[35:19.420 --> 35:24.020]  this design. So I would do it kind of like this, but I'm going to take a little drink
[35:24.020 --> 35:33.950]  of this drink first right now, taking a drink. And that was well-deserved. All right. So
[35:33.950 --> 35:38.150]  if we're building this room with four lights, I would put a large carbon filter. I like
[35:38.150 --> 35:42.390]  the 39 by eight carbon filter. They have those available right now at Hydro Indoor
[35:42.390 --> 35:48.390]  Growing Supplies. Then I would take that 38 by eight inch carbon, a 39 by eight inch carbon
[35:48.390 --> 35:53.950]  filter. I would use an eight inch wide duct that goes into two six inch ducts. So now
[35:53.950 --> 35:58.030]  my eight just went to two sixes and I would use the Y to run the ducting to two lights
[35:58.030 --> 36:04.990]  on each side. So I would have light one, a light two, a, and then light one B light to
[36:04.990 --> 36:10.190]  two B on opposite sides and then use another Y duct, more ducting, and then a Y duct to
[36:10.190 --> 36:15.070]  bring them back together and then attach that Y duct and the eight inch blower.
[36:15.070 --> 36:20.950]  I wrote something weird there. Attach that Y and the eight inch blower and the blower,
[36:20.950 --> 36:23.470]  send the air out of the room. Something I wrote doesn't make sense, but attach that
[36:23.470 --> 36:28.250]  Y duct to the blower and then send the air. See, I already have something wrong here because
[36:28.250 --> 36:32.470]  you should have carbon filter blower is the way it should go. So it should be carbon filter
[36:32.670 --> 36:40.590]  blower, ducting or carbon filter blower, Y ducting, light, light, Y, and then out of
[36:40.590 --> 36:45.350]  the house is where it should go. I typed something different, but I must've just been high at
[36:45.350 --> 36:45.870]  that time.
[36:47.270 --> 36:48.910]  That'd be a good spot for a booster fan.
[36:49.230 --> 36:53.550]  That right at the end there would be the perfect spot. So in this case, we're running it out
[36:53.550 --> 36:57.810]  of the grow hut or out of this eight by eight room that we built. Or if you're doing the
[36:57.810 --> 37:01.590]  bedroom, that's when you got to build that little wall and run it out of that duct or
[37:01.630 --> 37:06.830]  that little box that we made there. That was a good burp. I'm glad I got that one off the
[37:06.830 --> 37:11.670]  microphone. In some cases, you're going to need to run the ducting out of the house or
[37:11.670 --> 37:17.710]  to another room. Booster fans come in handy there. Try to keep the ducting as short and
[37:17.710 --> 37:20.870]  straight as possible. You don't want a lot of bends in your ducting and you don't want
[37:20.870 --> 37:27.910]  excessive long ducting. Also, if you can, hang your carbon filter from the ceiling because
[37:27.910 --> 37:30.550]  all of your heat and stale air is going to go up, hopefully.
[37:31.430 --> 37:38.750]  Air moves just like water. So, you know, if you got to pump it all the way to the ceiling
[37:38.750 --> 37:42.230]  from the floor, you know, that's just stealing energy.
[37:42.470 --> 37:46.070]  There you go. And heat rises. So you put that thing up there and you're, yeah.
[37:46.750 --> 37:47.470]  And then it won't suck.
[37:47.470 --> 37:48.710]  Hot air stinks more too.
[37:49.350 --> 37:50.270]  Yes, that's very true.
[37:50.270 --> 37:51.830]  Just stick it on the ceiling.
[37:52.870 --> 37:56.550]  And your carbon filter will work better if you keep the humidity at a more acceptable
[37:56.550 --> 37:59.590]  level. Get it closer to 50. Get away from that 70%.
[37:59.590 --> 38:02.830]  Like I've seen a couple of guys in their flower rooms at 70% humidity because they say
[38:02.830 --> 38:03.830]  it makes the bud sticky.
[38:04.230 --> 38:06.390]  It'll make your bud moldy is what you're going to get, bro.
[38:06.710 --> 38:09.910]  I've seen flower rooms with zero percent humidity.
[38:10.230 --> 38:12.550]  So much good old Southern Colorado.
[38:12.630 --> 38:14.270]  I was just going to say it's Colorado, bro.
[38:14.270 --> 38:15.230]  Don't look at me like that.
[38:16.270 --> 38:19.430]  And then your carbon filter pretty much quits working at that point, too.
[38:19.510 --> 38:21.350]  Yeah. Yeah.
[38:21.710 --> 38:24.190]  You need some some moisture to keep that charcoal active.
[38:24.710 --> 38:26.390]  All right. So we've got an exhaust set up.
[38:26.390 --> 38:27.470]  Now you need air in.
[38:28.150 --> 38:32.790]  Depending on the situation, I might make a four inch hole six inches from the corners
[38:33.030 --> 38:34.470]  and six inches off the ground.
[38:35.110 --> 38:37.110]  So imagine there's the corner of the room.
[38:37.110 --> 38:41.470]  I would go six inches in and six inches up and make a four inch hole.
[38:41.830 --> 38:44.110]  And then on the opposite side of that corner, do the same thing.
[38:44.110 --> 38:46.910]  And that'll give you eight four inch holes for fresh air.
[38:47.710 --> 38:49.630]  Then I go and get those HEPA filters from Lowe's.
[38:49.630 --> 38:50.830]  They're just little square sheets.
[38:50.830 --> 38:56.990]  And I staple those over the holes to keep any dirt bugs, freaking dog hair, hippie
[38:56.990 --> 38:59.910]  hair, keep all that shit out of the grow room with those HEPA filters.
[38:59.910 --> 39:00.630]  They work pretty well.
[39:01.390 --> 39:05.270]  I use dryer vents to cover and prevent light leaks right on the outside.
[39:05.310 --> 39:09.590]  I put those on the outside to where or you can put them on the inside, too, if you
[39:09.590 --> 39:10.710]  need to. But I like them on the outside.
[39:10.710 --> 39:13.590]  They just look smoother. But, you know, the inside may work because now the lights
[39:13.590 --> 39:15.150]  coming this way, it's not going to get in there.
[39:15.550 --> 39:19.310]  If you're using them for an intake, don't forget to take the little flapper out.
[39:19.590 --> 39:21.870]  Yeah, I've actually heard one going.
[39:23.070 --> 39:23.990]  It's like, what is that?
[39:23.990 --> 39:26.030]  No. Oh, shit. I forgot to take that out.
[39:26.430 --> 39:30.550]  Yeah, you could replace the small holes with one big hole and you can have a blower
[39:30.550 --> 39:35.270]  in there. If you do have something bringing air in, make sure that it is smaller than
[39:35.270 --> 39:39.190]  the exhaust fan. You want to suck out more than what you're bringing in.
[39:39.190 --> 39:41.030]  You want to create negative pressure in a grow room.
[39:41.310 --> 39:44.870]  You want it to feel if you have a real door, if it's in a bedroom, when you open the
[39:44.870 --> 39:48.110]  door, you want to you want to turn the knob and you want the door to fly open on its
[39:48.110 --> 39:50.830]  own. That's how you know you've got enough pressure to grow room.
[39:50.830 --> 39:51.710]  Positive pressure.
[39:52.430 --> 39:53.710]  That's negative sucking.
[39:54.310 --> 39:55.070]  Oh, yeah.
[39:55.110 --> 39:55.430]  Yeah.
[39:55.470 --> 39:55.550]  Yeah.
[39:56.190 --> 39:56.430]  Yeah.
[39:56.590 --> 40:00.310]  I was actually thinking of a room I was just in, so the door would have been.
[40:00.470 --> 40:00.790]  Yeah.
[40:03.030 --> 40:04.750]  We'll catch up. We'll get you on the same show.
[40:04.790 --> 40:06.110]  Well, I'm doing episode thirty nine.
[40:06.110 --> 40:06.910]  I don't know what number you're on.
[40:07.990 --> 40:09.150]  Forty two, man.
[40:11.430 --> 40:12.030]  So now we've.
[40:13.350 --> 40:15.990]  Guys, I wonder what's going to happen on episode forty two, because Jesse just jumped
[40:15.990 --> 40:16.830]  to the future on me.
[40:17.550 --> 40:19.030]  It clicked in my brain a second late.
[40:19.030 --> 40:20.550]  I was like, wait, man, we got to catch up.
[40:21.150 --> 40:23.190]  So you can replace all those holes with a big blower.
[40:23.510 --> 40:26.670]  You've got fresh air being pulled in when the exhaust fan pulls out stale air and
[40:26.670 --> 40:28.510]  humidity out of the room and out of the house.
[40:28.510 --> 40:29.710]  What does that even mean?
[40:29.950 --> 40:32.470]  You can tell I was lit when I wrote some of these notes and it got late.
[40:33.350 --> 40:37.510]  So we got fresh air coming in when the exhaust fan pulls the stale air and
[40:37.510 --> 40:38.550]  humidity out of the room.
[40:38.910 --> 40:41.510]  So you can add an air conditioner to bring in fresh air.
[40:41.510 --> 40:46.470]  Also, you might be able to bring in enough air under the bedroom door if you're
[40:46.470 --> 40:47.550]  doing this in a bedroom.
[40:49.350 --> 40:51.590]  I had a perfect little girl when I first started off.
[40:51.590 --> 40:54.510]  It was in a bedroom and I had the blower going over one light.
[40:54.510 --> 40:55.590]  I had a six inch blower.
[40:55.870 --> 40:58.950]  I was going over two lights and sucking that straight out of the room and I hung
[40:58.950 --> 41:02.470]  the carbon filter in the ceiling and I just let the fresh air come right under the
[41:02.470 --> 41:04.630]  door. And I feel like it was enough air.
[41:05.350 --> 41:08.030]  Yeah. Yeah. I feel like it was sufficient in there.
[41:08.030 --> 41:09.510]  It didn't get stifled or anything in there.
[41:10.350 --> 41:12.510]  So that space under the door, guys, that could be useful.
[41:12.750 --> 41:13.910]  You need fresh air coming in.
[41:13.910 --> 41:17.270]  So if you're building this big eight by eight room, cut some holes in there or add
[41:17.270 --> 41:21.190]  a blower. If you're using an eight inch blower out, you can use a four or a six inch
[41:21.230 --> 41:23.310]  blower. And I think it'll be just fine.
[41:24.030 --> 41:26.870]  And even if you're running a sealed room, I hate seeing this.
[41:26.910 --> 41:31.750]  This is a little more advanced stuff, but even sealed rooms need to have the
[41:31.870 --> 41:35.030]  ability to inject fresh air.
[41:37.230 --> 41:41.110]  You know, even if you don't use it, but once a week or something like that, it's
[41:41.430 --> 41:46.390]  you still need to recycle your air every now and then pumping CO2
[41:46.390 --> 41:49.070]  into air. I don't know.
[41:49.590 --> 41:51.110]  I know. Do you know what I know?
[41:51.110 --> 41:56.190]  What you mean? He's talking about a control, a closed environment, agriculture
[41:56.190 --> 41:58.070]  room where everything is sealed up.
[41:58.070 --> 42:01.950]  The only air that goes in the room is CO2 that's supplemented with the CO2 tank.
[42:01.950 --> 42:06.470]  We'll talk a little bit about that in the future because plants actually breathe
[42:06.470 --> 42:07.950]  CO2 and let out oxygen.
[42:08.150 --> 42:11.870]  But I think just pumping all that CO2 in there, they are going to need some oxygen.
[42:11.870 --> 42:13.230]  Your roots need oxygen.
[42:13.270 --> 42:15.230]  Your microbial life gets stale in there.
[42:15.230 --> 42:16.990]  Yeah. Yeah. So I agree.
[42:16.990 --> 42:21.030]  You have to put some oxygen in that closed room somehow and just use those HIPAA
[42:21.030 --> 42:22.310]  filters and filter your air.
[42:22.670 --> 42:25.510]  They also sell the shroom things, the shroom covers.
[42:25.750 --> 42:26.870]  I'm a big fan of those.
[42:26.910 --> 42:30.270]  OK, I've always thought they were a little overpriced, so I've just stuck with the
[42:30.270 --> 42:31.910]  HIPAA filters. I can't argue with that.
[42:31.950 --> 42:37.030]  Yeah. So, yeah, we sell a much bigger
[42:37.190 --> 42:41.230]  intake filter that's similar to a carbon filter
[42:42.030 --> 42:46.790]  and, you know, it's not applicable in all
[42:46.830 --> 42:52.990]  situations, but it's very reasonably priced for what it is and the lifespan.
[42:53.030 --> 42:57.150]  It's just touch over a hundred and it does some serious filtering.
[42:57.430 --> 43:01.750]  So you can bring air from outside into your grow, essentially, if you filter it
[43:01.750 --> 43:03.750]  with that. OK, sure. That's worth a ton of money.
[43:03.870 --> 43:10.470]  It looks like a gigantic K&N air filter for like a freaking F-22 Raptor or some
[43:10.470 --> 43:10.990]  shit.
[43:13.430 --> 43:16.550]  Oh, I wonder, God, imagine when you're done with that thing.
[43:16.550 --> 43:19.110]  You go dump it in the fucking oops, five dollars.
[43:19.310 --> 43:21.110]  You dump it in the fucking landfill.
[43:21.110 --> 43:22.750]  I'm not doing that anymore. I just called it was over.
[43:22.750 --> 43:25.750]  I'm glad you go dump it in the landfill and you set it down.
[43:26.110 --> 43:28.870]  I'm just picturing like some sort of Breaking Bad desert is where I was watching
[43:28.870 --> 43:32.230]  somebody in my mind dump it like throws it down in the desert and all these bugs.
[43:32.470 --> 43:34.790]  And like imagine all the crazy shit that's going to come out.
[43:34.830 --> 43:39.030]  You got a blower attached to it sucking every bug that flies by is going to go
[43:39.830 --> 43:42.310]  and just get sucked into that and get stuck in your trap.
[43:42.310 --> 43:46.670]  Now, we'll go hook it over the fence at the Monsanto facility.
[43:46.710 --> 43:49.230]  There we go. We're coming for you.
[43:49.550 --> 43:50.910]  Biological warfare.
[43:51.230 --> 43:52.390]  We're coming for you.
[43:52.670 --> 43:55.910]  All right. I'm going to try to I've got like three more pages of stuff typed out.
[43:56.230 --> 43:57.670]  I'm going to have to edit out the F word.
[43:57.670 --> 44:00.070]  So we're going to have to finish the show pretty soon.
[44:01.230 --> 44:02.830]  You should leave just that part in, though.
[44:04.230 --> 44:06.470]  I leave the effort and I'm done with paying five dollars for it.
[44:06.470 --> 44:07.830]  I already declared that earlier in the show.
[44:07.870 --> 44:08.150]  Cool.
[44:09.670 --> 44:12.590]  I was just so daydreaming and thinking about like, where would this thing
[44:12.590 --> 44:15.230]  because you can't like a boy was a picture and me and you doing it,
[44:15.230 --> 44:19.630]  I'm picturing like some shady grower with this big, gigantic vent cleaner.
[44:20.190 --> 44:22.990]  He's just rolling it out of the back of his truck in the desert somewhere.
[44:22.990 --> 44:25.350]  And I'm just like, oh, imagine what comes out of that dude.
[44:25.630 --> 44:27.710]  Hair bugs.
[44:27.750 --> 44:29.510]  It's not going to be anything pretty.
[44:30.630 --> 44:34.310]  All kinds of weird molds and danders and pollens.
[44:34.430 --> 44:36.830]  Oh, man. Yeah. Oh, so gross.
[44:36.830 --> 44:38.590]  All right. I mean, that's what I was.
[44:38.590 --> 44:43.270]  That was one thing when I was actually researching it before we got it.
[44:43.270 --> 44:48.390]  I was like, oh, this will be great for protection from outdoor.
[44:49.110 --> 44:51.270]  Yeah. Amateurs.
[44:51.270 --> 44:54.390]  Outdoor amateur pollen. Yeah. Or him.
[44:55.990 --> 44:57.950]  Man, I've got a male that might blow soon.
[44:57.950 --> 45:00.350]  He just reminded me that I did not move it earlier.
[45:01.590 --> 45:02.670]  He's in a shitty spot.
[45:02.670 --> 45:05.350]  If he goes, I don't want that to happen.
[45:05.550 --> 45:08.150]  Premature. Yeah, he's in.
[45:08.430 --> 45:10.310]  Yeah, I don't need him to go.
[45:10.310 --> 45:11.710]  He's in a bad spot. All right.
[45:11.710 --> 45:13.430]  So, guys, we've been ranting here.
[45:13.430 --> 45:15.550]  We're going to try to get back on track for a little bit.
[45:15.550 --> 45:18.310]  We got 15 more minutes or so before everyone's going to get 80.
[45:18.310 --> 45:20.950]  He can already happened to us
[45:20.950 --> 45:22.590]  since we've got ducting in place.
[45:22.590 --> 45:24.070]  Let's hang up some lights, guys.
[45:24.070 --> 45:26.790]  In this room, we have an eight by eight footprint and four lights.
[45:26.790 --> 45:29.430]  That means we can use a four by four area for each light.
[45:29.470 --> 45:31.510]  It's going to be bright in here. That's what we want.
[45:31.510 --> 45:33.590]  Divide the room into perfect quarters.
[45:33.590 --> 45:35.550]  Find the center for each quarter.
[45:35.550 --> 45:39.230]  Hang your lights so they're centered in the corners or the quarters, not corners.
[45:39.230 --> 45:42.070]  You want them centered in the quarters.
[45:42.070 --> 45:46.350]  So basically, you got a four by four section with the light perfectly above it.
[45:46.550 --> 45:49.070]  And every four by four space has a light right above it.
[45:49.070 --> 45:51.990]  Jesse's doing math on how many lumens and how many watts per square foot.
[45:51.990 --> 45:53.150]  That is, yes, it's impressive.
[45:53.150 --> 45:55.710]  You could do 600 while lights in the setup if you wanted.
[45:56.190 --> 45:57.990]  Thousands are the way to go in here, I think.
[45:59.550 --> 46:01.910]  That's my professional opinion, if you've got the electricity
[46:01.910 --> 46:03.910]  and you're building this room, put thousands in there.
[46:03.910 --> 46:06.750]  Oh, yeah, no, I totally agree.
[46:06.830 --> 46:08.470]  All right. I use those little.
[46:08.470 --> 46:10.870]  So 64 square feet, obviously.
[46:11.310 --> 46:13.310]  That's simple math.
[46:15.990 --> 46:18.230]  I'm all stoned. Work a calculator.
[46:18.950 --> 46:20.670]  Not wrong way.
[46:21.110 --> 46:22.870]  Always divide things the wrong way.
[46:22.870 --> 46:24.950]  That's a 62
[46:26.710 --> 46:28.510]  watts per square foot.
[46:28.510 --> 46:30.070]  And what would be your recommendation, Mr.
[46:30.070 --> 46:32.030]  Hydro shop expert?
[46:32.030 --> 46:35.470]  That's a really healthy lot per square foot.
[46:35.670 --> 46:38.470]  All right. Yeah, this is going to be a healthy room.
[46:38.630 --> 46:41.030]  Hey, Ryan, you've got a room kind of like this, dude. So good job.
[46:41.390 --> 46:43.150]  You might have taken some advice from me.
[46:43.150 --> 46:44.470]  That's no tear.
[46:44.470 --> 46:48.470]  Rojo, 120 watts per square foot.
[46:49.590 --> 46:51.270]  Yeah, that indoor acre.
[46:51.270 --> 46:55.270]  And we're talking about a spot called the indoor acre is what is that place is amazing.
[46:55.270 --> 46:58.630]  There's like a mile and a half of plumbing in there just for the hydro kit.
[46:59.310 --> 47:00.510]  All right. So we're hanging our lights.
[47:00.510 --> 47:04.550]  They're in the corner of the court, the the center of the quarters of the room.
[47:04.550 --> 47:06.590]  Right. There might be a lot of editing on the show.
[47:06.590 --> 47:07.750]  Guys were dabbed out.
[47:07.750 --> 47:09.470]  So I like to use those little eye hooks. I sell it.
[47:09.470 --> 47:11.990]  Lowe's, they're just screws with a little circle at the end of it.
[47:11.990 --> 47:13.990]  Basically, screw that into the ceiling,
[47:15.190 --> 47:16.950]  screw it directly into the ceiling beams.
[47:16.950 --> 47:19.110]  Make sure you hit a stud. Yes.
[47:19.110 --> 47:20.350]  Well, there will only be studs there.
[47:20.350 --> 47:23.310]  I mean, you're going to have mylar or a star plastic or a stud.
[47:23.710 --> 47:24.910]  So make sure you get it in there. Yeah.
[47:24.910 --> 47:28.030]  If you're in a bedroom, though. Yeah. Yeah. OK. There you go. Right on.
[47:28.030 --> 47:28.830]  I forgot about the bedroom.
[47:28.830 --> 47:31.750]  I got a quick trick for that and it helps you center your lights.
[47:32.230 --> 47:36.110]  Take two eight foot two by fours, screw them to the ceiling.
[47:36.270 --> 47:37.750]  Then you put your lights anywhere you want.
[47:37.750 --> 47:39.550]  You always know you hit a stud. Yeah.
[47:39.550 --> 47:41.270]  I need to do that in one one area.
[47:46.190 --> 47:49.270]  Yeah, I worked at a place where the lights were.
[47:50.670 --> 47:54.430]  I worked for two companies in the same building, ironically,
[47:55.750 --> 47:58.910]  and at the first company, I didn't help set anything up.
[47:59.790 --> 48:03.790]  And all the lights were hung from a floating grid ceiling.
[48:03.950 --> 48:08.710]  Big old raptor hoods with little tiny plastic hooks is absolutely
[48:08.710 --> 48:11.510]  like just super dangerous, dumb ass move.
[48:12.910 --> 48:15.750]  But when I went to work for the other company, I got paid to
[48:16.470 --> 48:19.270]  do a two by four structure all through that.
[48:19.710 --> 48:22.030]  We could support a couple of girls.
[48:22.030 --> 48:24.910]  So, yeah, guys, be safe when you're building stuff.
[48:24.910 --> 48:27.230]  We've talked about not being that asshole that burns down the house.
[48:27.590 --> 48:30.230]  Also, don't be the guy that takes down the bedroom on accident.
[48:30.830 --> 48:33.230]  If you're renting, you're going to have to pay for whatever you mess up.
[48:34.030 --> 48:34.790]  All right.
[48:35.910 --> 48:37.950]  I like those little light hangers to hang my lights.
[48:37.950 --> 48:39.710]  The ratchet style ones, those are perfect.
[48:39.710 --> 48:40.830]  I love them.
[48:40.830 --> 48:43.790]  Hang all four lights, screw in your bulbs and wipe off the bulbs.
[48:43.790 --> 48:45.590]  When you're done, wipe them off.
[48:45.590 --> 48:47.390]  I like to use like a
[48:47.390 --> 48:49.230]  it's a thing that you should be cleaning your drums with.
[48:49.230 --> 48:50.310]  It's a little soft.
[48:50.310 --> 48:51.590]  It's like a microfiber.
[48:51.590 --> 48:53.270]  Yeah. Clean it off with that.
[48:53.270 --> 48:55.190]  Sunglass stuff. Yeah. Sunglass stuff.
[48:55.190 --> 48:58.310]  Exactly. You don't want any scratches in that in the bulb
[48:58.470 --> 49:02.030]  or any dust or dirt on there or any oil from your finger on there.
[49:02.070 --> 49:05.470]  Any little thing that close to the bulb is going to definitely kill lumens.
[49:05.510 --> 49:07.870]  Make sure your bulb is screwed in completely.
[49:08.190 --> 49:12.430]  Yeah. That's and all of your connections are all pushed in tight on your ballast
[49:12.430 --> 49:13.270]  as well.
[49:14.030 --> 49:16.230]  So screwing your bulbs, wipe it off, make sure it's tight.
[49:17.470 --> 49:21.510]  Run the ducting from the blower to the Y duct to each light back to the other
[49:21.510 --> 49:25.390]  Y out of your grow room and then secure all of those ducting with tape.
[49:25.430 --> 49:27.950]  There's going to be a lot of pressure on the ducts.
[49:27.950 --> 49:30.230]  An eight inch blower puts out a lot of pressure.
[49:30.870 --> 49:35.030]  It may be a good idea also to grab a fan speed controller.
[49:35.990 --> 49:38.630]  You plug that in and then you plug your fan into that
[49:38.910 --> 49:41.670]  and you can actually your blower, your eight inch vortex blower.
[49:41.670 --> 49:45.270]  You can adjust how much by percentage of from.
[49:45.550 --> 49:48.030]  It only works about 50 percent is as low as I think it goes.
[49:48.030 --> 49:49.950]  But then you can go from 50 all the way to 100.
[49:50.950 --> 49:53.990]  If you're wanting to keep a little humidity in the room, turn it down.
[49:54.030 --> 49:57.350]  You can get it down to, you know, 50 percent humidity.
[49:57.350 --> 49:59.190]  Turn it down to 70 percent. It'll help you out.
[49:59.230 --> 50:02.150]  That's actually how I run it in one space at about 70 percent all the time.
[50:02.350 --> 50:07.230]  And some of the can fans come with the little three speed switch on the court
[50:07.230 --> 50:09.910]  already adjusted to it. Yes, that may be beneficial.
[50:09.990 --> 50:13.590]  And the hyper fan, the best fan on the market, in my opinion,
[50:13.590 --> 50:15.670]  it comes with one built in.
[50:15.670 --> 50:17.830]  Now, see, that's a new product for me.
[50:17.830 --> 50:20.390]  When I upgrade, it's time for some of those.
[50:20.390 --> 50:22.550]  All right. So now we've got ducting, you got lights on.
[50:22.990 --> 50:24.990]  It's kind of starting to look like a grow room.
[50:24.990 --> 50:27.110]  You got to hang a couple of fans on the walls.
[50:27.110 --> 50:31.750]  I would put fans right above the expected height of your plants.
[50:31.750 --> 50:33.830]  Like if you think your plants are going to get five feet tall,
[50:33.830 --> 50:36.790]  put a fan at five and a half feet right between the fan
[50:36.790 --> 50:40.950]  can or the light can it with a damn lot of words right between the plant canopy
[50:40.950 --> 50:42.910]  and the lights is kind of where I like a fan.
[50:42.910 --> 50:44.910]  Yeah. Keep the air moving.
[50:44.910 --> 50:46.630]  You don't want the air to get stale.
[50:46.630 --> 50:48.950]  Plants suck up the CO2 in the room quickly.
[50:48.950 --> 50:51.990]  They can use the CO2 around them super quickly.
[50:51.990 --> 50:54.830]  And you just got to move the air so there's more CO2 for them to use up.
[50:55.910 --> 50:57.710]  Yeah, we're 51 minutes in.
[50:57.710 --> 50:58.670]  Go ahead. What are we going to say?
[50:58.670 --> 51:00.950]  Would you throw maybe a box fan on the floor?
[51:01.430 --> 51:04.190]  I do like a box fan on the floor. Super low speed.
[51:05.590 --> 51:07.310]  If you're on a budget, the box fan is awesome.
[51:07.310 --> 51:10.350]  If you have more of a budget, I would recommend a carbon filter
[51:10.350 --> 51:12.270]  with like a six inch blower on top of it.
[51:12.270 --> 51:14.070]  Just dead sitting in the center of the room.
[51:14.070 --> 51:16.550]  Put some ducting off the blower up to the ceiling.
[51:16.990 --> 51:19.710]  And just move that air from the floor back up to the ceiling.
[51:20.030 --> 51:23.190]  And you're picking up CO2 off the ground and putting it back up
[51:23.190 --> 51:25.630]  to fall back down onto your plants. Nice.
[51:26.230 --> 51:28.190]  And that's just differences in budgets.
[51:28.190 --> 51:31.590]  If you've got a low, if you've got 30 bucks by a fan, if you got 160
[51:31.630 --> 51:33.750]  by a blower and a filter, yeah, just kind of.
[51:33.830 --> 51:35.710]  Or I guess it's going to be closer to 260.
[51:35.710 --> 51:38.550]  I guess that blower is going to be 120, 130.
[51:38.550 --> 51:40.830]  Your filters are going to be expensive.
[51:41.590 --> 51:44.870]  You know, I've watched everything escalate in price
[51:45.390 --> 51:48.030]  since I've been expanding my grows.
[51:48.030 --> 51:50.230]  And since Colorado has been getting more popular,
[51:50.390 --> 51:54.390]  everything has just gone up in price and it's not even a competitive raise.
[51:54.390 --> 51:55.430]  It's a gouging raise.
[51:55.430 --> 51:56.710]  And I can see it.
[51:56.710 --> 51:58.350]  They know what we're doing.
[51:58.350 --> 52:02.670]  I remember buying a light in like 2002
[52:03.990 --> 52:06.470]  and keeping your head down at the store, trying not to be noticed.
[52:06.470 --> 52:10.630]  Man, I swear I paid like five, 600 bucks for my first light setup.
[52:10.670 --> 52:14.390]  And it's just a magnetic 400 watt like.
[52:15.270 --> 52:17.470]  Nothing special whatsoever.
[52:17.470 --> 52:21.550]  So but everything else I feel like has gotten more expensive.
[52:21.630 --> 52:25.150]  Yeah. Lighting is the only only thing.
[52:25.150 --> 52:28.630]  And actually, I guess it's just because there's so many newer options.
[52:28.630 --> 52:30.790]  But basic lighting, I feel like it's gotten cheaper.
[52:31.910 --> 52:33.710]  Yeah. And more reliable.
[52:33.710 --> 52:36.550]  I remember you would you buy shit and it would just die on you.
[52:36.550 --> 52:38.750]  And now it seems to last at least a year or two.
[52:38.750 --> 52:40.870]  And if it doesn't, you can take it back.
[52:41.750 --> 52:43.150]  All right. We've gone 52 minutes.
[52:43.150 --> 52:45.910]  My next part is all about hanging up the ballast and electronics
[52:45.910 --> 52:48.470]  and making the board that I like to hang my stuff on.
[52:48.470 --> 52:50.390]  I think I'm going to leave everybody hanging.
[52:50.390 --> 52:52.790]  And we're going to do that part of the next episode.
[52:52.790 --> 52:55.190]  And I got a trick to help you take better pictures.
[52:55.950 --> 52:58.470]  But when you're doing that. Oh.
[52:58.470 --> 53:00.990]  Oh, Jesse's going to help us out with some tricks.
[53:01.790 --> 53:03.670]  When can you come back and do another episode, bro?
[53:03.670 --> 53:05.670]  Probably next week. All right. Yeah.
[53:06.590 --> 53:09.790]  We'll try to get him back for part three of our growing
[53:09.790 --> 53:11.630]  our building, our grow room episode.
[53:11.630 --> 53:13.870]  I'm going to give a huge, huge, super huge shout out to Hygro
[53:13.870 --> 53:14.710]  and our growing supplies.
[53:14.710 --> 53:16.990]  I know Jesse's here, so I'm kissing his ass a little bit.
[53:16.990 --> 53:18.750]  But seriously, they helped me out a lot.
[53:18.750 --> 53:19.670]  They sponsored this show.
[53:19.670 --> 53:21.990]  And without them, I couldn't do some of the things that I do.
[53:21.990 --> 53:24.950]  Do you have any idea when the next growers meeting is going to be?
[53:25.030 --> 53:29.550]  Yeah, I'm really bad with dates, but I know when it is.
[53:29.550 --> 53:32.470]  He's one of those guys that can build you a freaking farm in 10 minutes.
[53:32.750 --> 53:35.550]  But if you give him math or a calendar, he just gets all this
[53:35.550 --> 53:39.030]  like look on his face of like, can I hit it with a hammer?
[53:39.030 --> 53:41.150]  I'm actually great with math. I just can't ever do my work.
[53:42.590 --> 53:46.310]  Um, I just got a new phone, so
[53:47.390 --> 53:48.710]  he stepped up into the future.
[53:48.710 --> 53:51.110]  Yeah. So he's looking through his phone to find out when the next
[53:51.350 --> 53:54.750]  next is growing is at Hygro and or growing supplies.
[53:55.150 --> 53:57.430]  We gather at the back of the shop and we talk about growing.
[53:57.790 --> 54:01.430]  It's going to be Friday, the 21st, Friday, the 21st of October.
[54:01.910 --> 54:04.830]  Yeah. November, November, because we can't go back in time.
[54:04.870 --> 54:06.230]  Yeah. Yeah. Well,
[54:09.670 --> 54:10.950]  it's my favorite movie ever.
[54:11.830 --> 54:13.190]  Back to the future trilogy.
[54:13.190 --> 54:14.870]  All right, guys, I'm going to have to get free that day,
[54:14.870 --> 54:17.790]  no matter what happens, because you guys are all going to come say the date again.
[54:18.990 --> 54:21.230]  November 21st, November 21st.
[54:21.230 --> 54:25.190]  It's a Friday at Hygro and or growing supplies about six, six, 15.
[54:26.310 --> 54:29.950]  Yeah. Yeah. Well, we did it four to eight last time
[54:29.950 --> 54:33.630]  and kind of decided the two hours when we were open was kind of lame.
[54:33.630 --> 54:36.910]  So, OK, it's a little hint there, but
[54:37.990 --> 54:40.590]  I'm not saying anything, but we're going to have
[54:42.630 --> 54:43.750]  I don't know. It's awful.
[54:43.750 --> 54:46.030]  Yeah, no, we're going to have barbecue pork.
[54:46.030 --> 54:48.590]  We were thinking about doing turkey, but
[54:48.590 --> 54:50.070]  everyone's going to have plenty of turkey.
[54:50.070 --> 54:51.190]  I don't want to be that asshole.
[54:51.190 --> 54:53.030]  Oh, that's true. Yeah, that's true.
[54:53.030 --> 54:57.870]  But we have some good smoked pork from probably my dad will do it.
[54:58.430 --> 55:00.830]  He's been smoking meat for many years.
[55:01.590 --> 55:03.590]  Jesse's dad is a cool son of a bitch.
[55:03.590 --> 55:07.870]  And I am going to get a veggie, awesome vegetarian option, too.
[55:07.990 --> 55:10.110]  So nice. That's much appreciated.
[55:10.150 --> 55:12.630]  And just for people who need to eat their damn veggies.
[55:12.630 --> 55:15.230]  So everyone eats your veggies, eat your vegetables.
[55:15.230 --> 55:19.070]  Guys, I've been a vegetarian for, oh, my God, over 10 years.
[55:19.590 --> 55:20.950]  I can't remember exactly when.
[55:20.950 --> 55:23.510]  I know I was a vegetarian in 2002 for sure.
[55:24.750 --> 55:28.110]  Can't remember before that when I started, but there was an event
[55:28.110 --> 55:29.870]  that happened and one of my friends I hadn't seen in a while
[55:29.870 --> 55:32.110]  made fun of me for being a vegetarian at Bonnaroo.
[55:32.110 --> 55:34.350]  And I remember the first Bonnaroo was 2002.
[55:34.350 --> 55:35.870]  So I've been a vegetarian since then.
[55:35.870 --> 55:39.390]  And since I started eating better, I try to eat a little better
[55:39.390 --> 55:40.670]  and better and better all the time.
[55:40.670 --> 55:44.310]  But the more I take care of my body, the better I feel. It's so great.
[55:44.310 --> 55:45.350]  So eat your vegetables, guys.
[55:45.350 --> 55:47.630]  That's a that's a not don't eat as much meat.
[55:47.630 --> 55:52.230]  You know, even if you do eat meat, America eats way, way too much of it.
[55:52.510 --> 55:55.750]  And try to eat food. Quit eating like food product,
[55:56.710 --> 55:58.870]  like processed shit that kind of resembles food.
[55:58.870 --> 56:00.550]  You don't want that. You want food.
[56:00.550 --> 56:03.550]  If it's got like 17 ingredients in it, that's not food anymore.
[56:03.630 --> 56:08.070]  Yeah. Look for the fewer ingredients and the easier they are to pronounce.
[56:08.230 --> 56:09.990]  Yeah. Yeah.
[56:09.990 --> 56:12.630]  All those doses and ex doses and
[56:13.430 --> 56:15.910]  Oodlemates is none of that shit is good for you.
[56:16.950 --> 56:17.830]  We're kind of rambling now.
[56:17.830 --> 56:21.830]  How about we wrap up a podcast and we'll look forward to talking to you guys
[56:22.470 --> 56:25.630]  in about seven days. Where's the end?
[56:25.630 --> 56:28.870]  I've got that thing I read at the end of the show and I can't find it, guys.
[56:28.910 --> 56:30.310]  What am I going to do?
[56:30.310 --> 56:31.830]  I'm going to have to ad lib. I think I saw it.
[56:31.830 --> 56:34.150]  There's the paper I need. All right, guys.
[56:34.150 --> 56:36.390]  Don't forget to follow Jesse on Instagram and Twitter.
[56:36.390 --> 56:39.750]  It's at Jesse grows on Twitter. It's Jesse grows on Instagram.
[56:40.110 --> 56:42.750]  Make sure you follow I read genetics on Instagram.
[56:42.750 --> 56:46.790]  Make sure you follow I grow culture on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.
[56:46.990 --> 56:50.070]  That's a lot of demand. Just check us out if you can. I'll quit begging.
[56:50.790 --> 56:53.430]  Do it and do it now. Yes. Open up your.
[56:53.870 --> 56:55.670]  We need to get some like really cool tone.
[56:55.670 --> 56:57.590]  Open up your phone and follow us.
[57:00.710 --> 57:03.510]  I want to give a shout out to Yeti Oji.
[57:04.190 --> 57:05.950]  That's just an awesome strain.
[57:05.950 --> 57:11.430]  So I got some Yeti in middle of week five and it is fire.
[57:11.510 --> 57:12.750]  Yeah, it looks great.
[57:12.750 --> 57:16.150]  That's my favorite new strain that I got my hands on this year.
[57:18.070 --> 57:20.110]  We'll see. Well, I haven't run the glue yet.
[57:20.110 --> 57:22.310]  I'm getting close to I've got them next to each other in a room.
[57:22.590 --> 57:26.350]  There's cookies, Yeti, sour diesel, grateful dog,
[57:26.670 --> 57:29.590]  two gorilla glues and then two platinum emojis all in a row.
[57:30.110 --> 57:31.950]  So that's like my stellar row. Yeah.
[57:31.950 --> 57:34.030]  I'm like, oh, let's see what these girls do next to each other.
[57:34.510 --> 57:35.750]  They're all getting fed the same thing.
[57:35.750 --> 57:37.070]  They're all under the same two lights.
[57:37.070 --> 57:39.750]  We'll see what they do. They're in seven gallon pots.
[57:39.750 --> 57:41.310]  I'm getting excited.
[57:41.790 --> 57:45.390]  Just recently, I got to chuck pollen, took a grateful dog, mail
[57:45.390 --> 57:48.270]  and threw his pollen all over a bunch of sexy ladies.
[57:48.270 --> 57:51.630]  So about January, nature's green remedies will be stocked up.
[57:52.270 --> 57:54.470]  Nice. Yeah. All right.
[57:54.470 --> 57:58.350]  Now that the show's over, go to iTunes and or Stitcher search for I grow culture.
[57:58.350 --> 57:59.390]  Find the review section.
[57:59.390 --> 58:00.950]  Give me a five star rating after that.
[58:00.950 --> 58:03.190]  Type in a comment and let me know what you think of the podcast.
[58:03.550 --> 58:05.950]  And I will read your comments on a future episode.
[58:06.510 --> 58:08.070]  Big thanks to all the guys that have left comments.
[58:08.070 --> 58:08.670]  I appreciate that.
[58:08.670 --> 58:11.750]  The guys and gals that have left comments. I do appreciate that.
[58:12.310 --> 58:14.870]  Don't forget that the show is available on iTunes, Stitcher,
[58:14.870 --> 58:18.390]  and every episode is available on I read genetics, Colorado dot com.
[58:18.710 --> 58:21.230]  Yes, I have been slacking off on putting videos on YouTube,
[58:21.230 --> 58:22.790]  but I will catch up pretty soon.
[58:22.790 --> 58:24.590]  I've been having too much fun lately.
[58:24.590 --> 58:26.990]  What's a garden of the gods with my friend and had a great time.
[58:27.510 --> 58:29.590]  Just enjoyed life for a couple of days. I'm sorry.
[58:29.790 --> 58:31.510]  I'll get back on track. Don't worry.
[58:31.510 --> 58:33.310]  I want to give a huge shout out to my ninja spin.
[58:33.310 --> 58:35.150]  So I want to send an extra special thanks to Jesse
[58:35.150 --> 58:37.710]  for coming to all these episodes. It's really cool. Thanks a lot, bro.
[58:38.070 --> 58:39.710]  No problem. I enjoy it.
[58:39.710 --> 58:41.670]  Did it. He's getting good at it, isn't he, guys?
[58:41.670 --> 58:43.470]  You can tell he's so much more comfortable now.
[58:43.470 --> 58:45.630]  I'll sit in here like Larry King with a pen in my hand.
[58:47.030 --> 58:48.590]  It's just suspenders, bro.
[58:48.590 --> 58:51.430]  The dope hijacked my dad's closet. There we go.
[58:52.190 --> 58:53.830]  All right, guys. Thanks again for listening.
[58:53.830 --> 58:56.990]  Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me. Hey, baby.
