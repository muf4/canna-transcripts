[00:01.660 --> 00:05.540]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:05.540 --> 00:08.740]  It's time for a Thursday episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:08.740 --> 00:12.580]  I like to call these Thursday episodes the Thursday Quickie.
[00:12.580 --> 00:15.780]  These quickies are brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Bank.
[00:15.780 --> 00:17.980]  Make sure you check them out at dankseed.store.
[00:17.980 --> 00:22.660]  Ladies and gentlemen, it won't be a quickie unless we get started right away, so let's
[00:22.660 --> 00:25.060]  get on with the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:25.060 --> 00:29.460]  All right, podcast world, I am back with another Thursday episode.
[00:29.460 --> 00:33.300]  I like to start these shows by letting you know what I am smoking on today.
[00:33.300 --> 00:38.300]  I am dabbing on some of this Lemon OG Live Resin from our friends at the Garden of Weden.
[00:38.300 --> 00:40.260]  I scooped a little bit out of the large container.
[00:40.260 --> 00:42.620]  I've got a fairly large reserve.
[00:42.620 --> 00:43.620]  I scooped some out of there.
[00:43.620 --> 00:47.380]  I put it into a smaller container, and then I opened up some of these Lemon Jeffrey High
[00:47.380 --> 00:52.460]  Terpene Full Spectrum Extracts from our friends at Apothecary, and I dumped the high terpene
[00:52.460 --> 00:57.260]  extract into the live resin, and I gave it a little stir, and I've been taking dabs of
[00:57.260 --> 00:58.260]  that.
[00:58.260 --> 00:59.340]  It tastes tremendous.
[00:59.420 --> 01:01.100]  The high goes straight to my brain.
[01:01.100 --> 01:02.100]  It feels amazing.
[01:02.100 --> 01:05.020]  It's like fireworks and skyrockets for your brain.
[01:05.020 --> 01:06.020]  I like it.
[01:06.020 --> 01:07.020]  Great combination.
[01:07.020 --> 01:08.060]  So that's what I'm dabbing on.
[01:08.060 --> 01:09.060]  Let's keep it quick.
[01:09.060 --> 01:12.300]  Let's do a quick update on my most recent breeding project.
[01:12.300 --> 01:16.500]  If you've been paying attention, you know that I've been working on a blueberry cookies
[01:16.500 --> 01:18.740]  reversal project.
[01:18.740 --> 01:21.860]  I have a blueberry cookies plant that smells amazing.
[01:21.860 --> 01:22.940]  I have reversed it.
[01:22.940 --> 01:25.420]  I took the female and turned it into a male.
[01:25.420 --> 01:26.760]  It produced pollen.
[01:26.760 --> 01:30.200]  I put that pollen on several elite females.
[01:30.200 --> 01:31.560]  I put it on the Durban Poison.
[01:31.560 --> 01:32.640]  I put it on a Rise.
[01:32.640 --> 01:35.040]  I put the pollen on more blueberry cookies.
[01:35.040 --> 01:39.000]  I put it on Platinum Tangy, Strawberry Fields, and Lemon Skunk.
[01:39.000 --> 01:44.840]  I'm trying to breed a bunch of candy flavored, sweet and sour terp sort of things.
[01:44.840 --> 01:47.600]  I'm hoping I've created a big bag of candy.
[01:47.600 --> 01:49.640]  So those are just about done, you guys.
[01:49.640 --> 01:51.800]  They are at day 60 right now.
[01:51.800 --> 01:54.920]  Some of the seeds in the very tops of the plants are just about finished.
[01:54.920 --> 01:57.200]  The seeds at the lowers are taking a little longer to finish.
[01:57.200 --> 01:58.800]  Of course, they're almost done.
[01:58.800 --> 02:02.520]  I will start chopping those down here in just a few days.
[02:02.520 --> 02:04.920]  So I've got some new creations.
[02:04.920 --> 02:08.200]  We will need some new names soon once things are tested.
[02:08.200 --> 02:09.680]  So that's an update on the breeding projects.
[02:09.680 --> 02:13.480]  I'm going to let them go 63 to 65 days.
[02:13.480 --> 02:16.260]  That's usually just about perfect for the strains I'm working with.
[02:16.260 --> 02:21.520]  So they'll be cut down depending on my schedule and how my life goes in three to five days.
[02:21.520 --> 02:23.200]  And then we'll have some new stuff to play with.
[02:23.200 --> 02:24.200]  All right.
[02:24.480 --> 02:26.960]  So that's an update on the blueberry cookies breeding project.
[02:26.960 --> 02:30.440]  The blueberry cookies bud in there, it's in a three gallon pot.
[02:30.440 --> 02:33.920]  It's under a small white and that bud is as big as my forearm.
[02:33.920 --> 02:39.360]  I am amazed at the size of cola that plant put out, especially for being seeded.
[02:39.360 --> 02:40.360]  That is tremendous.
[02:40.360 --> 02:43.920]  All right, let's move forward and keep this Thursday quickie going.
[02:43.920 --> 02:50.120]  I got a message from somebody on Facebook and they said, when you guys go eight to nine
[02:50.120 --> 02:54.600]  weeks of flowering, are you considering that from the 12, 12 switch or from when it actually
[02:54.600 --> 03:00.160]  starts pre flowering, just trying to get a better timeframe on finishing?
[03:00.160 --> 03:04.800]  So this person is asking when we say that a plant will take nine weeks to flower, are
[03:04.800 --> 03:09.960]  we counting that nine weeks from when we see the first signs of bud set or from the day
[03:09.960 --> 03:17.320]  we switch the light cycle from whatever our veg time is over to our 12, 12 flowering time.
[03:17.320 --> 03:22.320]  That nine week flowering period or whatever your package of seed indicates, that is from
[03:22.320 --> 03:26.320]  the day you flip your timer to 12, 12.
[03:26.320 --> 03:31.400]  If you were on a 24 hour or an 18, six or a 19, five, whatever your veg cycle was the
[03:31.400 --> 03:40.000]  day you flip your timer to 12 on 12 off, that has now become day one of week one of your
[03:40.000 --> 03:41.000]  flowering period.
[03:41.000 --> 03:45.600]  So if you're going to go 63 days, that starts now, not from when you see bud set that starts
[03:45.600 --> 03:48.080]  from the time you flip.
[03:48.080 --> 03:52.560]  So mark your calendar eight to nine weeks from there and start paying attention.
[03:52.560 --> 03:58.120]  That is day one of flower, week one of flower, start adjusting your nutrients to that schedule,
[03:58.120 --> 04:02.040]  start planning your flowering, your flushing, your harvest, everything will go around that
[04:02.040 --> 04:03.040]  date.
[04:03.040 --> 04:08.920]  Now, something I've got to mention as a responsible grower, breeder and educator, do not let those
[04:08.920 --> 04:14.080]  numbers printed on the package dictate too heavily when you cut down.
[04:14.080 --> 04:15.960]  That is a good guideline.
[04:15.960 --> 04:20.060]  It's a good idea, but each plant is going to be different.
[04:20.060 --> 04:24.520]  If you get 10 seeds out of a package and five of them are males and you cut them down and
[04:24.520 --> 04:30.400]  you've got five females left, you may have one phenotype that ends or finishes at the
[04:30.400 --> 04:31.400]  end of week eight.
[04:31.400 --> 04:34.720]  It may be day 56 and that one is ready to cut down.
[04:34.720 --> 04:38.320]  You may have another one that needs to go all the way to day 60.
[04:38.320 --> 04:41.240]  You may have another that needs to go to day 63.
[04:41.240 --> 04:44.520]  There may be one that fucks around and wants to go to day 70.
[04:44.520 --> 04:48.800]  You're going to need to pay attention to each individual plant.
[04:48.800 --> 04:54.680]  Start flushing 10 to 14 days in advance of your anticipated harvest time, but don't hold
[04:54.680 --> 04:57.400]  too hard to that number.
[04:57.400 --> 05:00.440]  Pay more attention to the trichomes on the plant.
[05:00.440 --> 05:03.880]  Get yourself a scope, a magnifying glass.
[05:03.880 --> 05:08.320]  Get yourself a 420 scope or a dope scope or a jeweler's loop or something from the grow
[05:08.320 --> 05:15.280]  store or something on Amazon that will magnify your trichomes at least 60 to 100 times.
[05:15.280 --> 05:19.760]  You want a 60X or a 100X magnifier at minimum.
[05:19.760 --> 05:23.200]  Get yourself something with a light in it, an LED so that you can see what you're looking
[05:23.200 --> 05:27.640]  at and a nice jeweler's loop or a dope scope or a magnifying glass or something you can
[05:27.640 --> 05:32.400]  get in there and look at the trichomes and see the trichome color and the trichome development.
[05:32.400 --> 05:34.400]  You want them to start becoming amber.
[05:34.400 --> 05:36.800]  I've got a scope that hooks up to my computer.
[05:36.800 --> 05:37.840]  It's a dino light scope.
[05:37.840 --> 05:41.040]  I think it cost around $100 and I got it on Amazon.
[05:41.040 --> 05:42.040]  It plugs right into my computer.
[05:42.040 --> 05:43.680]  It was kind of a bitch to get it installed.
[05:43.680 --> 05:45.520]  To install it on my MacBook, it took me a minute.
[05:45.520 --> 05:49.000]  Once I got it figured out, it works like a charm every time I plug it in.
[05:49.000 --> 05:52.960]  So get the dino light scope, plug that into your MacBook, carry the computer into the
[05:52.960 --> 05:56.960]  grow room or carry a plant near your computer and press that magnifier, whatever you're
[05:56.960 --> 06:01.320]  using, press the magnifying glass, the magnifier, the dope scope, your 420 scope, your dino
[06:01.320 --> 06:04.520]  light scope, press it up against the plant and see what your trichomes look like.
[06:04.520 --> 06:06.000]  Check in several places.
[06:06.000 --> 06:09.400]  The top is going to be a little more done than the bottom in most cases.
[06:09.400 --> 06:10.680]  Check on the top.
[06:10.680 --> 06:14.880]  You're looking for 20 to 30% amber trichomes.
[06:14.880 --> 06:19.400]  The trichomes are those, the crystals, those mushrooms grown off the plants, those skinny
[06:19.400 --> 06:21.480]  stocks with round bulbous heads.
[06:21.480 --> 06:22.880]  That's a trichome.
[06:22.880 --> 06:24.320]  They're going to start off clear.
[06:24.320 --> 06:25.560]  They're going to get kind of silvery.
[06:25.560 --> 06:27.720]  Then they're going to get milky white.
[06:27.720 --> 06:30.000]  Then they're going to start degrading and turning.
[06:30.000 --> 06:33.040]  It's going to look like you sprinkled Dr. Pepper on them.
[06:33.040 --> 06:37.920]  You want about 30% of them to look like they've got Dr. Pepper on them.
[06:37.920 --> 06:41.640]  When you look in the screen, you're probably going to see, depending on how zoomed in you've
[06:41.640 --> 06:44.960]  got your stuff and how many trichomes are on your plants, you're going to see between
[06:44.960 --> 06:49.560]  10 and 30 trichomes in that little view on your viewfinder on your magnifier.
[06:49.560 --> 06:53.320]  If you've got 10, you want three of them to start turning amber.
[06:53.320 --> 06:54.800]  Does that make sense?
[06:54.800 --> 06:55.800]  30%.
[06:55.800 --> 07:00.300]  20 to 30% amber trichomes is what you're looking for when you harvest.
[07:00.300 --> 07:05.180]  The number on the seed pack is a good idea, but they don't know exactly which phenotype
[07:05.180 --> 07:06.180]  you got.
[07:06.180 --> 07:08.140]  They don't know the temperatures in your grow room.
[07:08.140 --> 07:11.100]  They don't know what kind of grow light you're growing with.
[07:11.100 --> 07:16.620]  There's so many variables that contribute to the finishing time of a plant that it is
[07:16.620 --> 07:22.380]  the numbers on the package are simply a suggestion and a guideline and unfortunately quite often
[07:22.380 --> 07:23.380]  a sales pitch.
[07:23.380 --> 07:26.540]  Why not tell you that this plant's going to be done in eight weeks when it could really
[07:26.540 --> 07:31.100]  take 10 weeks, but who knows because I've already got your money.
[07:31.100 --> 07:34.600]  Unfortunately a lot of breeders will do that stuff and back in the day that used to be
[07:34.600 --> 07:37.620]  a very easy way to increase sales.
[07:37.620 --> 07:40.800]  You can't do it so much anymore and it's not something I would do, but it can't be done
[07:40.800 --> 07:43.060]  so much anymore because we're much more accountable now.
[07:43.060 --> 07:44.060]  We're reachable.
[07:44.060 --> 07:46.900]  Social media makes the breeders very accountable.
[07:46.900 --> 07:51.580]  Anyway, that's not something I would have done, but it is something that has been done.
[07:51.580 --> 07:54.900]  People would just print, hey, this flower finishes in eight weeks and you grow it and
[07:54.900 --> 07:58.380]  it ends up taking 70 days and you're sitting there going, what the fuck?
[07:58.380 --> 08:01.140]  Or a lot of people just cut it down early and then they thought, man, this plant sucked.
[08:01.140 --> 08:04.700]  It wasn't very good and it was because they didn't let it go to its full potential.
[08:04.700 --> 08:06.340]  So don't be that guy.
[08:06.340 --> 08:08.500]  Don't cut plants down early.
[08:08.500 --> 08:14.380]  Hopefully the seeds that you have are from a breeder who had some morals and actually
[08:14.380 --> 08:18.220]  wrote down a realistic timeframe on their plants.
[08:18.220 --> 08:22.560]  I try to give a two week timeframe on my packaging or on my strain descriptions.
[08:22.560 --> 08:27.200]  If you ask me how long will this take, I will say eight to nine weeks or nine to 10
[08:27.200 --> 08:31.520]  weeks and I try to keep it realistic and I've grown enough of my plants to know how long
[08:31.520 --> 08:32.980]  they're actually going to take.
[08:32.980 --> 08:36.440]  Maybe some of the other breeders aren't growing enough of theirs and maybe they think it only
[08:36.440 --> 08:37.440]  takes eight weeks.
[08:37.440 --> 08:40.800]  I don't know, but don't hold too fast to what that says.
[08:40.800 --> 08:42.160]  Pay attention to each plant.
[08:42.160 --> 08:43.760]  Pay attention to each phenotype.
[08:43.760 --> 08:46.640]  The beauty from growing from seeds is that you can find something unique.
[08:46.640 --> 08:48.400]  You can find that one.
[08:48.400 --> 08:50.120]  Maybe you want something to take.
[08:50.120 --> 08:52.100]  Maybe you've got cycles that take eight weeks.
[08:52.100 --> 08:54.860]  Maybe you've got cycles that take eight or nine or 10 weeks.
[08:54.860 --> 08:59.780]  Maybe you can find a plant that fits perfectly into your system so you can dial it in perfectly.
[08:59.780 --> 09:01.260]  That's part of the beauty of growing from seeds.
[09:01.260 --> 09:03.460]  So you get to find the one that you like.
[09:03.460 --> 09:07.460]  You get to find the one that grows, smells, tastes, and smokes the way you like, but also
[09:07.460 --> 09:12.260]  you get to find the one that works the best in the grow room for you as a grower.
[09:12.260 --> 09:17.720]  So that timeframe goes from the time you flip your lights to 12-12.
[09:17.720 --> 09:19.680]  That is day one of.
[09:19.680 --> 09:22.300]  That's when you should switch to your bloom nutrients.
[09:22.300 --> 09:25.980]  That day is what you should base your anticipated flush time off of.
[09:25.980 --> 09:29.820]  That date is what you should base your anticipated harvest time off of.
[09:29.820 --> 09:32.940]  That day is what you should adjust your nutrient calendars off of.
[09:32.940 --> 09:37.940]  So day one is when you change your timer to 12 on and 12 off.
[09:37.940 --> 09:42.220]  All right, you guys, if I keep rambling on, this episode will not be a quickie.
