[00:57.820 --> 01:04.540]  You know, I like to start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[01:04.540 --> 01:08.260]  Today I've been taking dabs of Bananas Foster Live Batter.
[01:08.260 --> 01:11.320]  This is a blend of Banana OG and Paris Larry.
[01:11.320 --> 01:15.380]  On the package, the flavor is described as banana, sugar, and oatmeal.
[01:15.380 --> 01:16.540]  I think I agree with that.
[01:16.540 --> 01:18.500]  That's a really unique combination of flavors.
[01:18.500 --> 01:21.140]  It's sort of like a banana sugar cookie or something like that.
[01:21.140 --> 01:25.100]  It's got that candied banana flavor, and there is definitely a sweetness, maybe an oatmeal
[01:25.100 --> 01:26.780]  cookie aftertaste.
[01:26.780 --> 01:32.260]  I really love the banana turps and the buzz I get from banana flavored dabs.
[01:32.260 --> 01:40.060]  On the back of the package, it says it contains 67.49% THC and non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[01:40.060 --> 01:43.220]  Big shout out to the Bananas Foster Live Batter.
[01:43.220 --> 01:47.700]  All right, in this episode, I'm going to cover a few Patreon questions.
[01:47.700 --> 01:51.940]  Before we get there, let's do some shout outs to a few members of the 710 Club.
[01:51.940 --> 01:57.180]  Of course, the 710 Club are the folks who support us on Patreon at the $7.10 a month
[01:57.180 --> 01:58.980]  level or higher.
[01:58.980 --> 02:01.900]  So let's start off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.

[02:37.940 --> 02:43.940]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[02:43.940 --> 02:47.580]  All the information you need to support the show will be right there on the screen.
[02:47.580 --> 02:52.220]  And of course, I did include a link in the show notes and the video description.
[02:52.220 --> 02:57.800]  All right, you guys, this is the portion of the show where we jump into the Patreon messages.
[02:57.800 --> 02:59.940]  Let's not waste too much time.
[02:59.940 --> 03:05.380]  The first message comes from Austin Ron, and it goes just like this.
[03:05.380 --> 03:11.460]  Peace, Grover love and gracias from the heart of Prohibition Land, the Lone Star State.
[03:11.460 --> 03:14.180]  So we've got listeners down in Texas.
[03:14.180 --> 03:15.180]  Thank you for the message.
[03:15.180 --> 03:16.960]  Big shout out to my friends in Texas.
[03:16.960 --> 03:18.140]  It goes like this.
[03:18.140 --> 03:19.780]  I'm an avid listener of your channels.
[03:19.780 --> 03:25.140]  I'm a new home grower and I love your sustained and detailed as necessary knowledge.
[03:25.140 --> 03:28.020]  Thanks for letting us into your growers headspace.
[03:28.020 --> 03:29.020]  Thank you.
[03:29.100 --> 03:30.100]  You're very welcome.
[03:30.100 --> 03:32.220]  And thanks for listening to all of my channels.
[03:32.220 --> 03:39.500]  I think you include the podcast, the Instagram live feeds, the embracing organics appearances,
[03:39.500 --> 03:42.040]  and all of the other random places where I pop up.
[03:42.040 --> 03:44.080]  Thank you for checking me out.
[03:44.080 --> 03:49.400]  The message goes on to say, I thought I would share this on grafting, a rather obscure topic
[03:49.400 --> 03:51.660]  in the cannabis community.
[03:51.660 --> 03:57.020]  But after listening to your assertions, correction and recorrection, I found this.
[03:57.020 --> 04:02.640]  And while not conclusive, the following offers indication, if not evidence, that offspring
[04:02.640 --> 04:07.900]  from grafted plants contain DNA from both plants.
[04:07.900 --> 04:09.100]  Who would have thunk it?
[04:09.100 --> 04:10.700]  Thanks for fighting the good fight.
[04:10.700 --> 04:12.260]  Rock on bro.
[04:12.260 --> 04:14.700]  From our friend Austin Ron.
[04:14.700 --> 04:17.720]  So a few episodes back, I did talk about grafting.
[04:17.720 --> 04:21.460]  Somebody asked me if I was interested in grafting, if I could give advice about grafting.
[04:21.460 --> 04:27.300]  I said that in my opinion, that if we graft one plant to another plant, that over time,
[04:27.300 --> 04:31.740]  those genetics will mingle and we will not have true genetics on both branches.
[04:31.740 --> 04:36.000]  I've been receiving controversial messages, no hate mail or anything like that.
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.180]  But some people are saying that is possible.
[04:38.180 --> 04:40.020]  Some people say it is impossible.
[04:40.020 --> 04:43.380]  Some people told me I was reaching, no longer reaching.
[04:43.380 --> 04:45.900]  Here is volunteered scientific evidence.
[04:45.900 --> 04:50.780]  I think all of the evidence points to the fact that the genes will move.
[04:50.780 --> 04:55.380]  I tried to explain it succinctly in my last episode, but if I cut off your arm and I cut
[04:55.380 --> 04:58.780]  off my arm and we swap arms, sure, that's your arm, that's my arm.
[04:58.780 --> 05:01.140]  Mine is going to be the real pale, long, gangly arm.
[05:01.140 --> 05:03.780]  You'll be the darker arm and thicker arm on my body.
[05:03.780 --> 05:06.980]  We'll know where they came from, but the blood will move.
[05:06.980 --> 05:08.820]  Eventually the DNA will move.
[05:08.820 --> 05:10.580]  All of what's me will be in that arm.
[05:10.580 --> 05:11.860]  All of what's you will be in your arm.
[05:11.860 --> 05:13.220]  It will be your arm.
[05:13.220 --> 05:14.220]  I think it'll mix.
[05:14.220 --> 05:17.740]  I think the trees, the plants, the branches will do the same thing.
[05:17.740 --> 05:20.680]  Now we've got some scientific evidence from our friend Austin Ron.
[05:20.680 --> 05:21.680]  So a big shout out.
[05:21.680 --> 05:22.680]  Thank you to Austin Ron.
[05:22.680 --> 05:26.400]  I will skim this article just to appease my mind.
[05:26.400 --> 05:28.440]  I want to know that there is some proof out there.
[05:28.440 --> 05:32.400]  If you guys are interested, I will include this link in the show notes and you can read
[05:32.400 --> 05:33.560]  the article about grafting.
[05:33.560 --> 05:37.400]  I'm going to set it right here on my computer so I don't forget to do that.
[05:37.400 --> 05:41.120]  Also write the word link here on the notes and hopefully I remember.
[05:41.120 --> 05:42.760]  All right, let's move forward.
[05:42.760 --> 05:43.960]  Big shout out to Austin Ron.
[05:43.960 --> 05:48.240]  Thank you for the Patreon support and for the great update on my lesson.
[05:48.800 --> 05:53.760]  All right, I want to keep moving because I do have quite a few great messages from Patreon.
[05:53.760 --> 05:58.200]  This one comes from Cdub in NorCal.
[05:58.200 --> 05:59.920]  It says, Rasta Jeff Vibration.
[05:59.920 --> 06:02.040]  It's a good way to start a message.
[06:02.040 --> 06:03.200]  Then it goes like this.
[06:03.200 --> 06:06.960]  Thank you for all of the good vibes and helpful information that you keep radiating.
[06:06.960 --> 06:08.720]  That's fucking a great way to start a message.
[06:08.720 --> 06:10.900]  Good vibes and information that I'm radiating.
[06:10.900 --> 06:11.900]  Thank you for noticing.
[06:11.900 --> 06:16.400]  It goes on to say, I'd like to send some of that love back your way.
[06:16.400 --> 06:18.040]  Blessings of peace and health.
[06:18.840 --> 06:19.840]  Big respect.
[06:19.840 --> 06:23.240]  It says, and may your genetics be strong and your flowers beautiful.
[06:23.240 --> 06:26.760]  You have seen evidence of such, so your blessings are working.
[06:26.760 --> 06:27.760]  It goes on.
[06:27.760 --> 06:31.600]  It says, I was hoping to ask a few questions and I do not object of you using any of this
[06:31.600 --> 06:36.600]  in any formal format, except sharing my email.
[06:36.600 --> 06:38.320]  Of course, I'll keep you safe and private, bro.
[06:38.320 --> 06:44.140]  It goes on to say, I was hoping, I know you're into concentrates, but which feminized seeds
[06:44.140 --> 06:47.880]  from Irie would you recommend for a flower smoker?
[06:48.720 --> 06:51.560]  I primarily smoke with bongs and sometimes joints.
[06:51.560 --> 06:57.600]  Growing is limited to a couple 10 to 15 gallon containers outdoor and stealth is appreciated.
[06:57.600 --> 07:01.360]  Shorter and not quite so fragrant.
[07:01.360 --> 07:05.580]  So you want a recommendation on an Irie genetics strain.
[07:05.580 --> 07:06.840]  You're not a concentrate smoker.
[07:06.840 --> 07:10.800]  You're going to be smoking the flowers, probably through the bong or sometimes a joint.
[07:10.800 --> 07:12.420]  I like your style.
[07:12.420 --> 07:16.340]  You want to grow in 10 to 15 gallon containers outdoors.
[07:16.340 --> 07:17.340]  Stealth would be ideal.
[07:17.340 --> 07:21.060]  So you don't want something that smells like skunks and feet and shit.
[07:21.060 --> 07:25.440]  So far, I think that we need to recommend orange gasm to you.
[07:25.440 --> 07:27.460]  Orange gasm is really easy to grow.
[07:27.460 --> 07:28.700]  It's a beautiful plant.
[07:28.700 --> 07:30.420]  It's easy to handle outdoors.
[07:30.420 --> 07:33.320]  It's not going to smell like skunk gas and dirty feet and cannabis.
[07:33.320 --> 07:36.140]  It's going to smell like oranges and orange creamsicles.
[07:36.140 --> 07:37.840]  You're going to get a different aroma.
[07:37.840 --> 07:40.140]  That's a little bit less suspicious.
[07:40.140 --> 07:42.060]  It's also easier to grow outdoors.
[07:42.060 --> 07:43.980]  It doesn't take super long to finish.
[07:43.980 --> 07:47.060]  I think it'll make you really happy in the joint and in the bong.
[07:47.060 --> 07:50.060]  It's going to taste like fucking sweet, delicious oranges.
[07:50.060 --> 07:52.860]  If you're into that orange flavor, that'll be beautiful for you.
[07:52.860 --> 07:58.780]  If not, I may recommend we're going to want something outdoors a little bit shorter.
[07:58.780 --> 08:00.560]  It's hard to get away from the skunky stuff.
[08:00.560 --> 08:04.700]  Maybe some strawberry starburst, but it may take too long to finish wherever you are.
[08:04.700 --> 08:08.760]  The prana may get you away with it, but that prana has got that herb smell to it, although
[08:08.760 --> 08:11.060]  it's a wonderful plant outdoors.
[08:11.060 --> 08:12.260]  There is a lot more to this message.
[08:12.260 --> 08:13.260]  Let me keep moving.
[08:13.260 --> 08:15.420]  Excuse me for the cough there.
[08:15.420 --> 08:18.340]  I did take dabs before the show, and it's a cannabis podcast.
[08:18.340 --> 08:19.780]  I may cough again.
[08:19.780 --> 08:24.780]  It goes on to say, I was also wondering about auto flowers outdoors.
[08:24.780 --> 08:27.060]  Is that worth starting for the fall or the winter?
[08:27.060 --> 08:31.060]  I'm pretty sure I could keep them out of any rain, but is there enough light and warmth
[08:31.060 --> 08:35.900]  to produce any quality flower?
[08:35.900 --> 08:38.140]  I am not an auto flower expert.
[08:38.140 --> 08:39.940]  I don't grow any auto flowers.
[08:39.940 --> 08:45.300]  I don't know much about auto flowers, but if you can get them to finish before any adverse
[08:45.300 --> 08:47.460]  conditions, yeah, they'll flower out there.
[08:47.460 --> 08:48.460]  Put them out there.
[08:48.460 --> 08:49.460]  They'll grow.
[08:49.460 --> 08:50.460]  They'll flower.
[08:50.460 --> 08:52.780]  You'll get usable product depending on who you buy your seeds from and how you take care
[08:52.780 --> 08:53.780]  of them.
[08:53.780 --> 08:58.260]  Your results may vary, but yeah, auto flowers will work as long as they don't get snowed
[08:58.260 --> 09:02.180]  on and get destroyed by the winter environment.
[09:02.180 --> 09:04.140]  Outdoor auto flowers are a great idea.
[09:04.140 --> 09:05.860]  It goes on to say, I'm pretty sure I could keep them.
[09:05.860 --> 09:07.060]  Oh, we read that part.
[09:07.380 --> 09:13.140]  If so, any recommendations for breeders on feminized auto flower seeds?
[09:13.140 --> 09:15.620]  I am friends with Mephisto Genetics.
[09:15.620 --> 09:19.420]  Daz from Mephisto is a great dude, has helped me out, has done me a huge favor.
[09:19.420 --> 09:26.100]  So I'm going to return the favor and say, I would recommend Mephisto, M-E-P-H-I-S-T-O,
[09:26.100 --> 09:28.820]  Mephisto for feminized seeds.
[09:28.820 --> 09:31.100]  That is who I've seen the best results from.
[09:31.100 --> 09:32.940]  It's who I've heard the best from.
[09:32.940 --> 09:34.740]  Again, disclaimer, huge disclaimer.
[09:34.740 --> 09:39.240]  I do not grow auto flowers, so I can't testify firsthand.
[09:39.240 --> 09:42.540]  This is all from what I've seen, read, and heard.
[09:42.540 --> 09:45.780]  Also the dude's a friend of mine, so I want to give him a shout out and rep him.
[09:45.780 --> 09:49.500]  But Mephisto auto flowers would be the way to go.
[09:49.500 --> 09:55.100]  It says, I'm in NorCal and I've had some falling ash and it keeps swirling around the breeze
[09:55.100 --> 09:56.700]  and getting on the plant.
[09:56.700 --> 09:58.420]  I don't know what to believe about bud washing.
[09:58.420 --> 10:00.820]  All right, so we're working into a brand new question here.
[10:00.820 --> 10:02.780]  I don't know what to believe about bud washing.
[10:02.820 --> 10:05.580]  I was hoping you could shed some light on that subject.
[10:05.580 --> 10:06.980]  Should I even be considering it?
[10:06.980 --> 10:09.100]  It's only a little bit of ash.
[10:09.100 --> 10:13.580]  There's a lot of differing opinions and I really don't know who is reputable, but the
[10:13.580 --> 10:18.660]  bud washing recipe I've been considering are, and then he shares his recipe with me and
[10:18.660 --> 10:20.700]  I'm going to shit all over that recipe.
[10:20.700 --> 10:21.700]  Don't do that.
[10:21.700 --> 10:22.780]  I've got a better idea for you.
[10:22.780 --> 10:24.900]  Not even going to read that plan here on the air.
[10:24.900 --> 10:30.520]  So our listener friend is in California and unfortunately they're being ravaged and devastated
[10:30.520 --> 10:31.940]  by wildfires right now.
[10:32.100 --> 10:34.900]  Big love and big shout out to everybody who's having to deal with that fire.
[10:34.900 --> 10:35.980]  My heart goes out to you.
[10:35.980 --> 10:37.180]  Fire is fucking terrible.
[10:37.180 --> 10:40.660]  I've seen several people displaced due to fire.
[10:40.660 --> 10:43.900]  Thank your, thank your, whatever you believe in, thank it that your shit's not burned down
[10:43.900 --> 10:48.300]  because a lot of stuff burned down this summer and is continuing to burn.
[10:48.300 --> 10:52.260]  The point is there is ash falling from the sky in California.
[10:52.260 --> 10:55.300]  There was ash falling from the sky in Colorado.
[10:55.300 --> 10:57.860]  A lot of people were getting ashes in their plants.
[10:57.860 --> 10:59.980]  We could see the ash building up in the buds.
[10:59.980 --> 11:02.180]  We could see ash laying on the leaves.
[11:02.180 --> 11:05.900]  A lot of people were scrambling and trying, I said scrambling, a lot of people were scrambling
[11:05.900 --> 11:07.780]  and trying to figure out what to do.
[11:07.780 --> 11:10.940]  Some people were out there with shop vacs trying to suck off the ash.
[11:10.940 --> 11:13.960]  Some people are out there with leaf blowers trying to blow the ash off.
[11:13.960 --> 11:16.740]  Some people just said, fuck it and let the ash develop because there's nothing they can
[11:16.740 --> 11:20.760]  do about such a large crop with ash falling from the sky.
[11:20.760 --> 11:26.500]  Some people are going to result to or resort to what is known as bud washing and it is
[11:26.500 --> 11:27.980]  exactly what it sounds like.
[11:27.980 --> 11:34.020]  It is a post harvest bud wash, just like giving your car a wash, giving anything else a wash.
[11:34.020 --> 11:35.800]  It is the same idea.
[11:35.800 --> 11:40.580]  This is most commonly done for crops that have been infested with powdery mildew.
[11:40.580 --> 11:42.940]  This will wash the powdery mildew off of there.
[11:42.940 --> 11:45.520]  You can do this to a commercial crop.
[11:45.520 --> 11:48.700]  You can run this commercial crop that has been treated the way I'm going to tell you
[11:48.700 --> 11:52.220]  through microbial testing after it's had powdery mildew on it.
[11:52.220 --> 11:57.300]  If it's done properly, this method will remove the powdery mildew and you will pass Colorado
[11:57.340 --> 11:59.740]  regulated microbe testing.
[11:59.740 --> 12:04.580]  So if you've got powdery mildew on your buds, if you've got ashes on your buds, that is
[12:04.580 --> 12:07.880]  the only reason I would recommend bud washing.
[12:07.880 --> 12:09.820]  In most cases, I don't find it necessary.
[12:09.820 --> 12:14.720]  I find it to be more, you're going to cause more problems than you are good unless you've
[12:14.720 --> 12:17.820]  already got powdery mildew or ashes.
[12:17.820 --> 12:22.300]  I honestly don't want to recommend that you wash powdery mildew off.
[12:22.300 --> 12:26.300]  However, I understand that people are going to do what they've got to do.
[12:26.300 --> 12:27.500]  People grew a big ass crop.
[12:27.500 --> 12:31.900]  If it's a private grow, if it's an indoor grow, an outdoor grow, a commercial grow,
[12:31.900 --> 12:35.520]  people grew a product and they see it and they do not want to throw it away.
[12:35.520 --> 12:37.560]  If it were up to me, that would get tossed.
[12:37.560 --> 12:39.220]  That is a non-viable product.
[12:39.220 --> 12:40.220]  That's a failure.
[12:40.220 --> 12:43.700]  We've got to chalk that one up to me fucking up and having to correct an issue.
[12:43.700 --> 12:45.300]  Not everybody thinks the way that I do.
[12:45.300 --> 12:46.940]  Not everybody operates the way I do.
[12:46.940 --> 12:49.960]  There are going to be different solutions.
[12:49.960 --> 12:53.940]  When it comes to ash and powdery mildew, sometimes you've got to scramble the ash.
[12:53.940 --> 12:54.940]  That's not your fault.
[12:54.940 --> 12:57.860]  I understand you've got to make a product, so you've got to wash it off.
[12:57.860 --> 13:00.300]  That's more acceptable than powdery mildew to me.
[13:00.300 --> 13:07.500]  If you're going to do a flower wash or a post-harvest bud wash, if you insist on doing so, this
[13:07.500 --> 13:09.060]  is how I recommend you do it.
[13:09.060 --> 13:20.640]  I'm going to take a quick drink and then we'll jump into it.
[13:20.640 --> 13:22.400]  You had a three-bucket method in mind.
[13:22.400 --> 13:24.280]  I don't recommend the three buckets at all.
[13:24.280 --> 13:26.840]  I use one five-gallon bucket.
[13:26.840 --> 13:29.440]  I dump my five-gallon bucket frequently.
[13:29.440 --> 13:31.340]  You can see the powdery mildew layer.
[13:32.280 --> 13:35.300]  You can probably see the ash layer develop on the top of the water.
[13:35.300 --> 13:38.820]  As soon as you see that nice little funky layer, dump it and start over.
[13:38.820 --> 13:42.060]  That way you know you're getting a good cleaning out of this.
[13:42.060 --> 13:47.140]  The basic way to do bud washing, I get a five-gallon bucket and I fill it most of the way with
[13:47.140 --> 13:48.140]  water.
[13:48.140 --> 13:49.940]  You've got to leave some room because you're going to put buds in your hands in there.
[13:49.940 --> 13:51.780]  You need room to work in there.
[13:51.780 --> 13:53.220]  Fill it most of the way with water.
[13:53.220 --> 13:55.620]  I got five gallons of water in a five-gallon bucket.
[13:55.620 --> 13:58.020]  There's an inch to work with, maybe two inches.
[13:58.020 --> 14:01.320]  Then I use 30% hydrogen peroxide.
[14:01.320 --> 14:03.140]  The expensive shit, the good shit.
[14:03.140 --> 14:04.140]  That is what I buy.
[14:04.140 --> 14:05.820]  That is what I use.
[14:05.820 --> 14:10.840]  Depending on the amount of powdery mildew I'm trying to rinse off of my plants or perhaps
[14:10.840 --> 14:15.340]  the amount of ash I'm trying to wash off of my plants, that will help me determine how
[14:15.340 --> 14:18.340]  much peroxide I want to add to this water.
[14:18.340 --> 14:25.380]  I may start with approximately 25 milliliters per five-gallon bucket.
[14:25.380 --> 14:29.820]  If my shit is real intense and real bad, I may consider 50 mils.
[14:29.820 --> 14:37.380]  I would never go above 70 milliliters of hydrogen peroxide per five-gallon bucket of water.
[14:37.380 --> 14:39.300]  If you need more than that, it's a lost cause.
[14:39.300 --> 14:40.300]  You done fucked up.
[14:40.300 --> 14:43.060]  Don't even bother washing it.
[14:43.060 --> 14:49.060]  We've got our five-gallon bucket and we have put 30 to 50, maybe a little bit more milliliters
[14:49.060 --> 14:52.540]  of 30% hydrogen peroxide in this bucket.
[14:52.780 --> 14:59.820]  Disclaimer time, sidebar, personal protective equipment must be used.
[14:59.820 --> 15:05.360]  Before you even pick up the bottle of hydrogen peroxide, before you think about it, put on
[15:05.360 --> 15:07.100]  rubber gloves.
[15:07.100 --> 15:10.840]  Before you pick up the bottle, put on some sort of goggles.
[15:10.840 --> 15:16.180]  The hydrogen peroxide will fuck your skin and your eyes up very bad if it comes in contact
[15:16.180 --> 15:18.460]  with your skin and or eyes.
[15:18.460 --> 15:20.740]  It will burn your eyes to shit.
[15:20.740 --> 15:23.700]  It will burn your skin and make your skin turn white and bubbly.
[15:23.700 --> 15:26.900]  Depending on how sensitive your skin is, you will have different reactions.
[15:26.900 --> 15:31.380]  I've seen hydrogen peroxide and Xerotol reactions on skin before.
[15:31.380 --> 15:33.420]  You don't want it.
[15:33.420 --> 15:34.940]  It's really easy to prevent.
[15:34.940 --> 15:35.980]  Put on gloves.
[15:35.980 --> 15:37.900]  Put on a long-sleeve shirt.
[15:37.900 --> 15:40.300]  You're wearing a mask already because it's COVID time.
[15:40.300 --> 15:42.100]  Put on a mask over your face.
[15:42.100 --> 15:44.720]  Put on some rubber or some goggles, not rubber gloves.
[15:44.720 --> 15:46.020]  Don't put rubber gloves on your face.
[15:46.020 --> 15:49.020]  If I catch you with rubber gloves on your face, you're going to get a drug test and
[15:49.020 --> 15:50.020]  get written up.
[15:50.300 --> 15:53.620]  Put some goggles on your face so you don't get that shit in your eyes.
[15:53.620 --> 15:54.940]  Protect yourself.
[15:54.940 --> 15:57.100]  This stuff will dissolve the powdery mildew.
[15:57.100 --> 16:01.260]  That means it will also dissolve other organic components, which could be your eyeball.
[16:01.260 --> 16:02.260]  Let's not do that.
[16:02.260 --> 16:05.640]  Now you're going to get paranoid that it's going to dissolve your trichomes.
[16:05.640 --> 16:06.900]  We're just going to rinse it and pull it out.
[16:06.900 --> 16:10.540]  We're not going to be in there long enough to do anything to get rid of the trichomes.
[16:10.540 --> 16:12.300]  It's not intense enough to do that.
[16:12.300 --> 16:14.340]  It's just going to wash that powdery mildew right off of there.
[16:14.340 --> 16:17.080]  So you've got your personal protective equipment.
[16:17.080 --> 16:18.080]  You've got gloves.
[16:18.080 --> 16:19.080]  You've got goggles.
[16:19.140 --> 16:23.240]  And I say before you even get the fucking peroxide out, because I've seen people reach
[16:23.240 --> 16:26.400]  for a product on a shelf and they pull it off the shelf and the lid wasn't on it all
[16:26.400 --> 16:28.280]  the way and they poured it on themselves.
[16:28.280 --> 16:30.240]  I've seen people shake a bottle.
[16:30.240 --> 16:33.160]  Just you go to grab whatever and you shake your drink like this and the lid's not on
[16:33.160 --> 16:35.840]  it and it fucking splashes into your face.
[16:35.840 --> 16:37.160]  Wear some protective equipment.
[16:37.160 --> 16:38.160]  That shit won't happen.
[16:38.160 --> 16:41.320]  So you've got your proper personal protective equipment.
[16:41.320 --> 16:42.320]  You got your gloves.
[16:42.320 --> 16:43.360]  You got your goggles.
[16:43.360 --> 16:44.360]  Maybe a mask.
[16:44.360 --> 16:45.360]  Hopefully long sleeves.
[16:45.360 --> 16:46.960]  Always guys wear shoes.
[16:46.960 --> 16:48.160]  I know it's fun if you're outdoors.
[16:48.240 --> 16:49.960]  You're being a fucking hippie.
[16:49.960 --> 16:50.960]  Wear some shoes.
[16:50.960 --> 16:53.520]  You don't want pesticides and products on your feet.
[16:53.520 --> 16:57.440]  The soles of your feet are one of the number one most absorbent parts of your body for
[16:57.440 --> 17:00.480]  absorbing pesticides and toxic chemicals.
[17:00.480 --> 17:03.040]  Probably also absorbing positive shit, but we don't think about that.
[17:03.040 --> 17:04.320]  We don't stress on it.
[17:04.320 --> 17:07.760]  I know that you shouldn't be running around barefoot in a grow because if I've applied
[17:07.760 --> 17:11.520]  a pesticide in the grow, it landed on the floor and now it's going up through the bottoms
[17:11.520 --> 17:13.740]  of your feet into your body.
[17:13.740 --> 17:14.740]  Protect yourself.
[17:14.740 --> 17:15.740]  Stay safe.
[17:15.740 --> 17:16.740]  I know you want to have fun and be a hippie.
[17:16.740 --> 17:18.380]  That's good, but this is growing.
[17:18.380 --> 17:19.380]  We need to be safe.
[17:19.380 --> 17:22.860]  We're smoking medical cannabis so we don't get cancer.
[17:22.860 --> 17:27.180]  Let's not go fucking play with pesticides and absorb them in our feet to give us cancer.
[17:27.180 --> 17:28.480]  We need to balance this shit out.
[17:28.480 --> 17:30.020]  So personal protective equipment.
[17:30.020 --> 17:34.580]  You've got your hydrogen peroxide, 30 to 50, maybe a little bit more milliliters mixed
[17:34.580 --> 17:36.740]  into your five gallon bucket of water.
[17:36.740 --> 17:39.300]  I just use plain water right from the tap.
[17:39.300 --> 17:42.020]  Just room temperature or whatever temperature you can fuck with.
[17:42.020 --> 17:44.620]  Hose temperature, I guess you probably have.
[17:44.620 --> 17:46.120]  Then I've got gloves on.
[17:46.200 --> 17:47.200]  I've got my plants.
[17:47.200 --> 17:48.200]  I've harvested my plants.
[17:48.200 --> 17:50.720]  I cut it into manageable sections.
[17:50.720 --> 17:55.480]  It's just chunks, probably branches, somewhere between six, eight, 10, 12, maybe 14 inches
[17:55.480 --> 17:56.480]  long.
[17:56.480 --> 17:58.240]  However deep that five gallon bucket is.
[17:58.240 --> 18:01.440]  I want to grab my buds, my branches, just one branch at a time.
[18:01.440 --> 18:02.720]  You can do a handful if you want to.
[18:02.720 --> 18:03.720]  I prefer one at a time.
[18:03.720 --> 18:05.280]  It's more effective.
[18:05.280 --> 18:09.520]  Dunk that bitch right into the hydrogen peroxide solution and give it a good swirl.
[18:09.520 --> 18:10.800]  Just shake it around.
[18:10.800 --> 18:14.880]  You're trying to just jostle that powdery mildew right off of that bud and then pull
[18:14.880 --> 18:16.280]  it out of there and give it a look.
[18:16.280 --> 18:18.640]  Do you still see more powdery mildew on there?
[18:18.640 --> 18:20.160]  Does it need another rinse?
[18:20.160 --> 18:21.160]  Put it in there.
[18:21.160 --> 18:22.160]  Give it a jostle.
[18:22.160 --> 18:23.160]  Shake it around.
[18:23.160 --> 18:27.600]  Once you are confident that you have knocked off all the powdery mildew, and don't go fucking
[18:27.600 --> 18:29.760]  crazy with this jostling motion.
[18:29.760 --> 18:31.100]  We're just trying to knock it off.
[18:31.100 --> 18:32.380]  Gently knock off the powdery mildew.
[18:32.380 --> 18:35.720]  We're not trying to smack the trichomes off of the branches.
[18:35.720 --> 18:39.240]  Not trying to smack the trichomes off the buds, knock the buds off the branches.
[18:39.240 --> 18:40.560]  Not trying to destroy everything.
[18:40.560 --> 18:42.480]  We're trying to fix our problem we fucked up.
[18:42.640 --> 18:45.000]  Just gently jostle it in that water.
[18:45.000 --> 18:46.040]  Knock those trichomes off.
[18:46.040 --> 18:47.280]  Give it a good rinse.
[18:47.280 --> 18:48.280]  Pull it out.
[18:48.280 --> 18:53.200]  Then hang it up and let it drip dry and put a fan near it for a little while while it's
[18:53.200 --> 18:54.200]  drying.
[18:54.200 --> 18:56.960]  Don't put the fan right directly on it, but have air moving.
[18:56.960 --> 19:00.920]  Have a dehumidifier near it so you can get rid of all that excess moisture.
[19:00.920 --> 19:05.900]  Do not trap these plants that you just dunked into a humid area.
[19:05.900 --> 19:08.640]  You do not want to cause mildew problems in these plants.
[19:08.640 --> 19:13.280]  Give them plenty of airflow in a wide open space or somewhere you can evacuate all of
[19:13.280 --> 19:14.720]  that stale air.
[19:14.720 --> 19:17.040]  If you're indoors, you need a blower extracting air.
[19:17.040 --> 19:18.040]  You need a dehumidifier.
[19:18.040 --> 19:21.800]  If you're outdoors, just let that water evaporate as it needs to.
[19:21.800 --> 19:26.460]  The buds will take a few hours to dry, but they were already wet inside.
[19:26.460 --> 19:27.460]  They were moist.
[19:27.460 --> 19:28.760]  There's natural water in there.
[19:28.760 --> 19:29.800]  They get rained on.
[19:29.800 --> 19:31.480]  The environment does that to them.
[19:31.480 --> 19:32.720]  They will dry.
[19:32.720 --> 19:37.680]  Again, don't trap them in a stagnant, humid environment.
[19:37.720 --> 19:42.520]  Basically, what we're going to do, we're going to put on our personal protective equipment.
[19:42.520 --> 19:45.120]  We're going to mix up our hydrogen peroxide solution.
[19:45.120 --> 19:47.240]  We're going to dunk each and every branch into there.
[19:47.240 --> 19:51.740]  Then we're going to hang it up in a well-ventilated area that it will not get moldy.
[19:51.740 --> 19:54.720]  That is our basic method for bud washing.
[19:54.720 --> 19:59.140]  I don't like the method that you chose because mixing a couple of those ingredients together
[19:59.140 --> 20:02.920]  is going to make foam like a volcano like we used to do in school.
[20:02.920 --> 20:04.980]  That doesn't seem necessary to do to my plants.
[20:04.980 --> 20:07.160]  It's also going to add different flavors.
[20:07.160 --> 20:10.320]  A couple of the things you added in your recipe will add flavors.
[20:10.320 --> 20:11.860]  We don't need those flavors.
[20:11.860 --> 20:17.800]  The hydrogen peroxide will evaporate or dissipate very rapidly, very, very rapidly.
[20:17.800 --> 20:19.680]  It will be gone before the water.
[20:19.680 --> 20:25.440]  There will be no remaining aroma, no remaining flavor, no residuals at all if you do it correctly.
[20:25.440 --> 20:29.760]  If you've got big, giant buds that are fucking footballs or donkey dicks or whatever you
[20:29.760 --> 20:34.100]  want to call them, you may need to cut those big, chunky buds down to smaller, more manageable
[20:34.100 --> 20:37.980]  pieces because inside there, you're going to get moisture trapped in there and you
[20:37.980 --> 20:40.060]  may cause potential problems.
[20:40.060 --> 20:43.780]  If you've got big, chunky football, donkey dick, whatever you want to call them, buds,
[20:43.780 --> 20:48.500]  big spears, maybe break them down into smaller, more manageable pieces, pieces that aren't
[20:48.500 --> 20:51.780]  going to have a bunch of moisture trapped inside of there so that you create your own
[20:51.780 --> 20:53.880]  problem after doing your dunk.
[20:53.880 --> 20:59.020]  Be very mindful that you just added a bunch of unnecessary water to your hanging, drying,
[20:59.020 --> 21:00.340]  and curing environment.
[21:00.340 --> 21:01.620]  You need to remove that water.
[21:01.620 --> 21:03.500]  You need to keep airflow happening.
[21:03.500 --> 21:05.060]  The shit's going to drip all over the floor.
[21:05.060 --> 21:08.580]  You may have to come mop that shit up off the floor just to get the water out of the
[21:08.580 --> 21:09.580]  room.
[21:09.580 --> 21:13.300]  Now is a time to really think you're trying to save the crop, not make it worse.
[21:13.300 --> 21:16.580]  All right, C-Dub and NorCal, I hope I helped you out.
[21:16.580 --> 21:17.580]  That was a great question.
[21:17.580 --> 21:22.420]  I do see a lot of people out there talking about it and performing bud washes right now.
[21:22.420 --> 21:26.020]  It's not something I would do unless it's highly, highly necessary, but I understand
[21:26.020 --> 21:28.180]  that ash is undesirable.
[21:28.180 --> 21:32.260]  We don't want ashes on the buds until right before we hit it or right before it gets to
[21:32.260 --> 21:33.260]  our lungs.
[21:34.020 --> 21:35.500]  That's the way to rinse them off.
[21:35.500 --> 21:37.420]  30% hydrogen peroxide.
[21:37.420 --> 21:42.500]  You can also use zero tall, maybe use less zero tall than hydrogen peroxide if you choose
[21:42.500 --> 21:48.860]  to do so, but the 30% hydrogen peroxide at 30 to 50 mils per gallon, drop it in there,
[21:48.860 --> 21:53.700]  give it a shake, knock that PM off, knock those ashes off, then hang it up to dry.
[21:53.700 --> 21:54.740]  Let me know how this works for you.
[21:54.740 --> 21:58.500]  If you've got any follow-up questions, I would be more than happy to help you out.
[21:58.500 --> 21:59.500]  Send me an email.
[21:59.500 --> 22:04.020]  I'm at jenniferjennetix at hotmail.com or hit me on patreon, patreon.com forward slash
[22:04.020 --> 22:05.180]  grow from your heart.
[22:05.180 --> 22:07.700]  I'm going to take a quick look here to see how long we've been recording.
[22:07.700 --> 22:09.540]  I've got my time going on my phone.
[22:09.540 --> 22:12.360]  We've got plenty of time for at least one more message.
[22:12.360 --> 22:15.100]  This one comes from our friend North, North Terps.
[22:15.100 --> 22:16.100]  What up North?
[22:16.100 --> 22:17.100]  Good to hear from you, bro.
[22:17.100 --> 22:18.100]  I hope you're doing well.
[22:18.100 --> 22:19.700]  I talked to North quite a bit.
[22:19.700 --> 22:22.340]  This message goes, what up Rasta Jeff?
[22:22.340 --> 22:24.380]  It's always a pleasure to communicate with you.
[22:24.380 --> 22:25.900]  It's always great to hear from you too, brother.
[22:26.140 --> 22:31.340]  It says, shout out to White Mike on his recent episode on Operation Legalize the World.
[22:31.340 --> 22:32.500]  I love that, bro.
[22:32.500 --> 22:35.140]  Mike, your next operation is Legalize the World.
[22:35.140 --> 22:36.540]  We're not doing just states anymore.
[22:36.540 --> 22:38.120]  We're not doing our nation.
[22:38.120 --> 22:40.900]  It is a global mission.
[22:40.900 --> 22:41.900]  Legalize worldwide.
[22:41.900 --> 22:42.980]  Mike, you are heading that.
[22:42.980 --> 22:43.980]  That is yours.
[22:43.980 --> 22:44.980]  You are in charge.
[22:44.980 --> 22:46.060]  You direct the army.
[22:46.060 --> 22:47.220]  Let us know what you need.
[22:47.220 --> 22:48.820]  We're going to legalize worldwide.
[22:48.820 --> 22:49.820]  Let's get serious.
[22:49.820 --> 22:52.780]  It says, anyways, with that being said, I have a question.
[22:52.780 --> 22:54.860]  If maybe you could clarify on using microbes.
[22:55.180 --> 22:56.700]  Okay, I have a question.
[22:56.700 --> 22:58.540]  Maybe you could clarify on using microbes.
[22:58.540 --> 22:59.660]  There should be a period there.
[22:59.660 --> 23:04.180]  It says, I've been experimenting with it using hydro, and I'm just curious if there is a
[23:04.180 --> 23:10.060]  preferred method of microbes and feeding and process for the best way to balance your pH
[23:10.060 --> 23:15.740]  as quickly as possible so that I don't run into deficiencies or if I'm asking the right
[23:15.740 --> 23:16.740]  question.
[23:16.740 --> 23:20.140]  I think you might know what I'm trying to get at, and I'm hoping you can help.
[23:20.140 --> 23:21.660]  Thank you, my guru.
[23:21.660 --> 23:24.340]  Peace, love, and respect.
[23:24.340 --> 23:27.060]  But I do know exactly what you're talking about.
[23:27.060 --> 23:33.020]  When we add our microbes to our pH solution, it can drastically change the pH of our feeding
[23:33.020 --> 23:34.020]  solution.
[23:34.020 --> 23:36.220]  It can drastically change the pH.
[23:36.220 --> 23:37.740]  I don't know if it's going to go up or down.
[23:37.740 --> 23:40.260]  It depends on where your solution is and what microbes you're using.
[23:40.260 --> 23:41.260]  I think it goes way up.
[23:41.260 --> 23:46.380]  I think when I add recharge, I think my pH goes up.
[23:46.380 --> 23:51.740]  This listener, so North is concerned that we are disrupting the pH to a manner which
[23:51.740 --> 23:56.800]  it will disrupt the uptake of the elements and nutrients that are available to the plant
[23:56.800 --> 23:59.680]  in that nutrient solution, which is a valid concern.
[23:59.680 --> 24:03.820]  We just put a bunch of expensive nutrients into a reservoir, into a tank, into a feeding
[24:03.820 --> 24:07.260]  system, and then we're going to feed it to our plants and hope the plants get the best
[24:07.260 --> 24:08.260]  out of that.
[24:08.260 --> 24:11.140]  But now I'm going to add another product that's going to fuck that all up and mess up the
[24:11.140 --> 24:15.120]  pH and make some of the nutrients unavailable to my plant.
[24:15.120 --> 24:18.540]  I think I understand what you're asking.
[24:18.540 --> 24:19.540]  We mix up our stuff.
[24:19.540 --> 24:21.440]  We add a liquid or a powder.
[24:21.920 --> 24:26.240]  Some people are going to say to adjust your pH before you add your microbes, and some
[24:26.240 --> 24:29.880]  people will say to adjust the pH after you add your microbes.
[24:29.880 --> 24:34.560]  I think if you get your solution mixed up, adjust your pH, and then add your microbes,
[24:34.560 --> 24:35.560]  you'll be fine.
[24:35.560 --> 24:38.080]  I also think it will work perfectly the other way.
[24:38.080 --> 24:42.600]  I bet you Scotty and Guru have some information, maybe an update on this.
[24:42.600 --> 24:46.280]  I want to see what happens if you ask them the exact same question because they make
[24:46.280 --> 24:48.040]  a microbial product.
[24:48.040 --> 24:53.280]  I'm using a lot of my experience and knowledge to talk from using that microbial product.
[24:53.280 --> 24:55.600]  Shout out to Recharge, Real Grovers Recharge.
[24:55.600 --> 24:59.360]  This is not a recharge ad, but that's one of the main products I use.
[24:59.360 --> 25:01.520]  I know where you're coming from with this question.
[25:01.520 --> 25:04.960]  When we mix in that recharge, it makes the pH go crazy.
[25:04.960 --> 25:06.600]  Then we add that to our plants.
[25:06.600 --> 25:10.960]  You are concerned that since we have ... Usually we are stubborn about the pH.
[25:10.960 --> 25:11.960]  We want to adjust the pH.
[25:11.960 --> 25:17.160]  We're in the right range to make elements bioavailable to our plants.
[25:17.280 --> 25:25.360]  When those microbes come in contact with the water and the rhizosphere, there is a carbonic
[25:25.360 --> 25:30.280]  reaction that happens, to the best of my knowledge, almost instantly.
[25:30.280 --> 25:35.600]  It doesn't take a lot of time for the other elements, the water, the rhizosphere, the
[25:35.600 --> 25:40.280]  other nutrients to neutralize that effect within the microbes.
[25:40.280 --> 25:44.880]  That pH swing will be minimized within seconds, if not minutes, depending on the size of your
[25:44.880 --> 25:48.920]  rhizosphere and the amount of water, but you're not using fucking hundreds of gallons.
[25:48.920 --> 25:53.840]  I think it's going to happen almost instantaneously when that water hits the rhizosphere.
[25:53.840 --> 25:57.400]  I think it's all just going to go, oh wait, I was way out of whack because I was in water.
[25:57.400 --> 26:02.000]  I was in suspension, but now I have hit something that I know what to do with.
[26:02.000 --> 26:05.280]  I think it balances itself out almost instantly.
[26:05.280 --> 26:09.240]  Again, I would like to hear Guru and Scotty's feedback and input on this.
[26:09.240 --> 26:10.920]  If you guys are listening, dude, chime in.
[26:10.920 --> 26:14.040]  Either send me a message or just do a podcast about it.
[26:14.200 --> 26:19.600]  The question is, are my microbes, is the pH of my microbes going to mess up my uptake
[26:19.600 --> 26:21.600]  of my plants and how do I prevent that from happening?
[26:21.600 --> 26:22.600]  That's the gist of the question.
[26:22.600 --> 26:27.720]  If you guys have feedback, I invite you to send me a message or do your own show about
[26:27.720 --> 26:28.720]  it, Scotty and Guru.
[26:28.720 --> 26:29.720]  Check out the Dude Grows show.
[26:29.720 --> 26:34.680]  Of course, Scotty Real is the proprietor of Recharge, so he's going to have answers to
[26:34.680 --> 26:35.680]  this.
[26:35.680 --> 26:39.720]  I hate to just pass the buck on a question, but when I know that there's an expert right
[26:39.720 --> 26:41.960]  down the street that we can contact, I think that's what we'll do.
[26:42.080 --> 26:44.080]  I'm going to write down a note to ask Guru.
[26:44.080 --> 26:45.080]  I'm writing that.
[26:45.080 --> 26:50.280]  I'm going to write it on this page also so I can find this one.
[26:50.280 --> 26:55.640]  Then we'll ask Guru and Scotty Real, but I think I gave you the appropriate answer.
[26:55.640 --> 27:00.520]  I think the carbonic reaction happens almost instantaneously to where you don't have to
[27:00.520 --> 27:04.560]  worry about that pH fluctuation for just a very short amount of time.
[27:04.560 --> 27:06.800]  I don't think it's of any concern.
[27:06.800 --> 27:10.400]  I am going to talk to people who are absolutely more qualified to answer that question.
[27:10.400 --> 27:13.760]  I'm not shy to admit that I'm not a microbe expert.
[27:13.760 --> 27:16.600]  Since Guru and Scotty are just a text message away, I will ask them.
[27:16.600 --> 27:19.560]  However, it is not an appropriate time to message them.
[27:19.560 --> 27:20.720]  I'm recording kind of late at night.
[27:20.720 --> 27:23.640]  I get some time to myself late at night here.
[27:23.640 --> 27:26.240]  They'd probably be mad at me if I text them right now, so I'm not going to do that.
[27:26.240 --> 27:27.440]  I will get in touch with my friends.
[27:27.440 --> 27:30.040]  We'll get you some more useful information.
[27:30.040 --> 27:31.040]  All right.
[27:31.040 --> 27:34.320]  North, North Terps, I hope I helped you out a little bit.
[27:34.320 --> 27:37.920]  Hopefully, Scotty and Guru heard this, and they will chime in and give you a little bit
[27:37.920 --> 27:38.920]  more info.
[27:38.920 --> 27:40.520]  If not, I'll get it going for you.
[27:40.520 --> 27:41.520]  All right.
[27:41.520 --> 27:44.520]  I've got one more great message that I want to answer on this episode.
[27:44.520 --> 27:45.640]  Thank you guys for hanging out.
[27:45.640 --> 27:48.200]  It's two long episodes in a row.
[27:48.200 --> 27:49.200]  Feeling good on this episode.
[27:49.200 --> 27:50.200]  Again, thank you.
[27:50.200 --> 27:51.200]  I got my groove back.
[27:51.200 --> 27:52.420]  I got my rhythm back.
[27:52.420 --> 27:57.480]  This message comes from Girls Grow Too, and it goes just like this.
[27:57.480 --> 28:02.760]  It says, hey, Rasta Jeff, I loved the legalization presentation with White Mike and just became
[28:02.760 --> 28:04.920]  a Patreon of his.
[28:04.920 --> 28:06.280]  That is awesome.
[28:06.280 --> 28:10.840]  Our friend Girls Grow Too saw the legalization presentation that featured White Mike, and
[28:10.840 --> 28:13.480]  they went and signed up for White Mike's Patreon.
[28:13.480 --> 28:14.480]  Thank you.
[28:14.480 --> 28:15.480]  I appreciate that.
[28:15.480 --> 28:17.040]  I'm sure Mike appreciates it as well.
[28:17.040 --> 28:20.840]  Absolutely, I'm sure that Mike's wife and little kids appreciate that because he spoils
[28:20.840 --> 28:21.840]  them.
[28:21.840 --> 28:22.840]  He doesn't spend money on himself.
[28:22.840 --> 28:25.240]  He's going to spend that contribution on his family.
[28:25.240 --> 28:26.600]  Shout out to Mike and his family.
[28:26.600 --> 28:28.400]  He appreciates your help.
[28:28.400 --> 28:30.120]  Let me keep moving because I'm fucking rambling.
[28:30.120 --> 28:33.160]  It says, Mike is great, and I love the chemistry you two have.
[28:33.160 --> 28:35.820]  He did well staying on the mic.
[28:35.860 --> 28:40.180]  That is a huge compliment because sometimes Mike does have problems staying on the microphone.
[28:40.180 --> 28:41.180]  Thank you.
[28:41.180 --> 28:42.180]  I kept him on the mic.
[28:42.180 --> 28:43.180]  He kept himself on the mic.
[28:43.180 --> 28:44.180]  That is a huge notice.
[28:44.180 --> 28:45.300]  Good job, Mike.
[28:45.300 --> 28:46.740]  People are liking your show.
[28:46.740 --> 28:47.900]  Now there is a question here.
[28:47.900 --> 28:55.420]  It says, my wife finally said yes to me getting a real grow light for Christmas this year.
[28:55.420 --> 28:56.420]  That's pretty awesome.
[28:56.420 --> 28:58.740]  I love it that the wife has given you some permission.
[28:58.740 --> 29:03.000]  It says, I'm looking for a light that would work in a four by five room.
[29:03.000 --> 29:04.540]  My budget is a hard 250.
[29:05.260 --> 29:10.020]  He's got 250 bucks to light up a four by five room.
[29:10.020 --> 29:11.700]  Probably looking for an LED, it doesn't say.
[29:11.700 --> 29:12.700]  Does it say?
[29:12.700 --> 29:13.980]  It says, I would love a Canon.
[29:13.980 --> 29:16.260]  I don't think it's in the budget.
[29:16.260 --> 29:19.020]  I don't think a Canon LED is in the budget.
[29:19.020 --> 29:24.140]  Even if you go to blacksailmarket.com and use coupon code RastaJeff, you can get yourself
[29:24.140 --> 29:25.140]  a nice deal.
[29:25.140 --> 29:27.980]  I don't think that 250 is going to get you there.
[29:27.980 --> 29:30.220]  It says, I don't think it's in the budget.
[29:30.220 --> 29:36.100]  As a disabled combat veteran with epilepsy, my grow is my life and gives me purpose.
[29:36.100 --> 29:40.500]  This is the second episode where I've read about somebody being a combat veteran with
[29:40.500 --> 29:42.780]  a grow giving them a new purpose.
[29:42.780 --> 29:43.780]  I love this.
[29:43.780 --> 29:46.540]  I love that we're helping you out and that you have found some purpose.
[29:46.540 --> 29:48.660]  It says, where are we?
[29:48.660 --> 29:50.220]  You're secretly my mentor.
[29:50.220 --> 29:51.220]  That means a lot to me.
[29:51.220 --> 29:52.220]  Thank you.
[29:52.220 --> 29:53.220]  It's not a secret anymore.
[29:53.220 --> 29:54.220]  Thank you.
[29:54.220 --> 29:55.460]  If you ever need help in the grow, just reach out directly.
[29:55.460 --> 29:57.660]  I'll be more than happy to help you out.
[29:57.660 --> 30:01.420]  That goes on with, thank you for all you do for the industry and the community.
[30:01.420 --> 30:03.060]  Much love your way.
[30:03.060 --> 30:05.620]  Brother, much love and much respect your way as well.
[30:05.620 --> 30:07.220]  I said it in the last episode.
[30:07.220 --> 30:11.900]  I appreciate veterans and especially combat veterans and people who've been blowed up
[30:11.900 --> 30:14.060]  in war and shit.
[30:14.060 --> 30:19.060]  I guess I'm a giant pussy because I don't see myself armed and equipped and shooting
[30:19.060 --> 30:20.060]  at people.
[30:20.060 --> 30:23.620]  I said in the last episode, if you shoot at me or throw a grenade at me, I'm fucking running.
[30:23.620 --> 30:24.620]  I quit.
[30:24.620 --> 30:25.620]  Fuck that.
[30:25.620 --> 30:26.620]  Game over.
[30:26.620 --> 30:28.820]  I appreciate you and respect you for what you do.
[30:28.820 --> 30:29.820]  That does mean a lot to me.
[30:29.820 --> 30:31.820]  I said it in the last episode.
[30:31.820 --> 30:35.380]  Without people protecting my freedom, I don't know how much freedom I would have.
[30:35.380 --> 30:38.180]  Without getting all patriotic and weird on the episode and political, thank you.
[30:38.180 --> 30:40.380]  I appreciate your service.
[30:40.380 --> 30:48.820]  Man, I don't know what to recommend for a $250 light to fill a four by five sealed room.
[30:48.820 --> 30:51.180]  I wish we could get you a couple of Canon LEDs.
[30:51.180 --> 30:55.660]  I think one Canon LED would fill a three by three space and get your plants happy in that
[30:55.700 --> 30:59.220]  three by three and then slowly we can upgrade maybe next Christmas, maybe next birthday
[30:59.220 --> 31:00.220]  or something.
[31:00.220 --> 31:05.020]  We could talk the wife into a new light, but $250 is not going to cover a Canon LED.
[31:05.020 --> 31:06.580]  It's going to get you close.
[31:06.580 --> 31:07.980]  Also here's where I'm torn.
[31:07.980 --> 31:09.540]  I kind of work with Black Sail.
[31:09.540 --> 31:10.540]  They're friends of mine.
[31:10.540 --> 31:11.540]  We've got agreements.
[31:11.540 --> 31:13.900]  I shouldn't be advertising other lights in here.
[31:13.900 --> 31:19.060]  I really don't know what other light company to recommend, but I do have a large audience
[31:19.060 --> 31:21.700]  with a lot of reach and a lot of compassion.
[31:21.700 --> 31:25.660]  So here's what I'm going to do for you for my friend Girls Grow Too.
[31:25.660 --> 31:27.580]  I need some advice.
[31:27.580 --> 31:31.780]  Will you guys that are listening and are watching, please comment on the YouTube channel and
[31:31.780 --> 31:39.460]  recommend a good solid grow light for around 250 bucks for a disabled veteran who needs
[31:39.460 --> 31:40.460]  some help.
[31:40.460 --> 31:41.820]  They're a combat veteran with epilepsy.
[31:41.820 --> 31:43.940]  We need to grow them some quality medicine.
[31:43.940 --> 31:45.340]  We need to improve their garden.
[31:45.340 --> 31:50.260]  So I need some advice on a $250 light.
[31:50.260 --> 31:51.460]  It doesn't have to be an LED.
[31:52.220 --> 31:53.220]  It doesn't say LED in here.
[31:53.220 --> 31:54.580]  LED would probably be best.
[31:54.580 --> 31:55.820]  It's going to save on electricity.
[31:55.820 --> 31:57.220]  It's going to be easier to cool.
[31:57.220 --> 32:02.740]  So if we can get a 250 watt LED light that will work in a four by five room, that would
[32:02.740 --> 32:03.820]  be awesome.
[32:03.820 --> 32:08.140]  Please leave comments, details, and information in the video description here so that our
[32:08.140 --> 32:09.900]  friend knows where to go look.
[32:09.900 --> 32:14.500]  All you've got to do is go to YouTube, pull up episode 475, and there will be advice left
[32:14.500 --> 32:15.500]  in the comments.
[32:15.500 --> 32:17.940]  And thank you to my audience members that are going to help us out.
[32:17.940 --> 32:19.880]  I do appreciate that.
[32:19.880 --> 32:23.680]  Now here's another thing that I'm going to do, and I'm going to do it completely shamelessly.
[32:23.680 --> 32:25.040]  This is not for me.
[32:25.040 --> 32:27.960]  This is for a disabled combat veteran.
[32:27.960 --> 32:31.800]  This young man has served our country and helped us out and he's fucked up because of
[32:31.800 --> 32:32.800]  it.
[32:32.800 --> 32:34.440]  So it's our turn to serve him back.
[32:34.440 --> 32:37.160]  He's got 250 and he needs some grow lights.
[32:37.160 --> 32:40.480]  Is there a grow light company out there that can fill in his gap?
[32:40.480 --> 32:44.760]  If 250 is a good start and your light costs three or 400 bucks, is there somebody out
[32:44.760 --> 32:47.280]  there that wants to help out a disabled veteran?
[32:47.280 --> 32:49.320]  I'll give you a shout out on the podcast.
[32:49.320 --> 32:50.640]  Let me know what you can do.
[32:50.640 --> 32:51.640]  Send me an email.
[32:51.640 --> 32:53.680]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[32:53.680 --> 32:56.080]  Let's help out our disabled veteran friends.
[32:56.080 --> 32:57.080]  We owe it to them.
[32:57.080 --> 32:58.080]  All right.
[32:58.080 --> 32:59.680]  So I think that's what I can do for you.
[32:59.680 --> 33:03.560]  I don't have a recommendation, but all the shit that I just said is going to be better
[33:03.560 --> 33:05.920]  than a recommendation for a light.
[33:05.920 --> 33:10.800]  Thank you for the, dude, thank you for the fucking, the protection, for the service.
[33:10.800 --> 33:12.480]  And thank you for all of the Patreon support.
[33:12.480 --> 33:14.400]  I see your name on Patreon a lot.
[33:14.400 --> 33:16.260]  We communicate quite a bit.
[33:16.260 --> 33:17.260]  Thank you.
[33:17.260 --> 33:18.260]  Thanks again.
[33:18.260 --> 33:20.700]  I appreciate your message and I hope this works out well for you.
[33:20.700 --> 33:24.380]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes, smokers
[33:24.380 --> 33:28.420]  and growers, combat veterans, and everybody else out there.
[33:28.420 --> 33:30.060]  I don't know who else to put in that group.
[33:30.060 --> 33:31.540]  You, you and all your friends and family.
[33:31.540 --> 33:32.860]  I want to thank you guys for listening.
[33:32.860 --> 33:34.300]  I want to thank you for hanging out.

[33:35.580 --> 33:36.740]  I found my groove again.
[33:36.740 --> 33:38.600]  I can't wait to record more episodes.
[33:38.600 --> 33:40.940]  If it wasn't so late, I'd probably just go again.
[33:40.940 --> 33:42.540]  I want to thank you guys for listening.

[34:30.620 --> 34:31.620]  My throat is done.
[34:31.620 --> 34:33.580]  My voice is burnt out, perfectly timed.

[34:35.300 --> 34:37.660]  I should be back in just a couple of days with fresh new content.
[34:37.660 --> 34:40.580]  I want to give a giant shout out to Smoke What?
