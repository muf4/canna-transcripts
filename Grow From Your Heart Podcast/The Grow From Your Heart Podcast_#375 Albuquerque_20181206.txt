[00:00.000 --> 00:01.980]  Hey, welcome to the show, everyone.
[00:01.980 --> 00:05.680]  It's time for episode 375 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:05.680 --> 00:08.460]  This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:08.460 --> 00:12.860]  If you need new seeds, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company, and you can find
[00:12.860 --> 00:18.360]  them at www.dankseed.store.
[00:18.360 --> 00:21.880]  I like to start the podcast off by letting you know what I am smoking.
[00:21.880 --> 00:26.640]  Today I've been taking dabs of the Pre-98 Bubba Kush high cannabinoid full spectrum
[00:26.640 --> 00:29.240]  extract from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[00:29.240 --> 00:35.440]  The label says it is 86% THC and 98.8% total cannabinoids.
[00:35.440 --> 00:40.840]  There is not a lot of aroma coming out of this jar, but the concentrate in the jar looks
[00:40.840 --> 00:43.640]  like just little chunks of gold diamonds.
[00:43.640 --> 00:46.560]  It looks like I've got gold flakes in a jar.
[00:46.560 --> 00:48.600]  The high that comes from this is super mellow.
[00:48.600 --> 00:49.600]  It's kind of heavy.
[00:49.600 --> 00:50.760]  It makes your shoulders nice and relaxed.
[00:50.760 --> 00:52.760]  It makes your head go kind of numb.
[00:52.760 --> 00:53.800]  Feels really good.
[00:53.800 --> 00:57.200]  It's like you just relieve pressure in your body when you take dabs of this.
[00:57.200 --> 00:58.960]  I really like the concentrate.
[00:58.960 --> 01:01.640]  Not a lot of flavor, but so much potency.
[01:01.640 --> 01:06.960]  That's the Pre-98 Bubba Kush high cannabinoid full spectrum extract from Apothecary Farms.
[01:06.960 --> 01:09.400]  I picked that up at their new Pueblo location.
[01:09.400 --> 01:10.400]  Make sure you check them out.
[01:10.400 --> 01:13.280]  All right, podcast world, let's jump into a podcast.
[01:13.280 --> 01:15.000]  This may be a short episode.
[01:15.000 --> 01:16.440]  This is going to be a Thursday episode.
[01:16.440 --> 01:19.880]  I've been delivering two episodes per week for quite a while now.
[01:19.880 --> 01:23.800]  This week has been a little overwhelming with some work stuff, with a little bit of travel,
[01:23.800 --> 01:26.960]  and I've got a family member who is sick, which is bringing more family into town, so
[01:26.960 --> 01:28.760]  I'm a little loaded up this week.
[01:28.760 --> 01:33.120]  This episode is going to be short so that I can focus on a solid Monday episode.
[01:33.120 --> 01:37.400]  If everything goes according to plan, the Monday episode will be the pheno hunting episode,
[01:37.400 --> 01:40.960]  which will include a talk about sexing your plants, and we will also talk a little bit
[01:40.960 --> 01:43.360]  more about mother plants in that episode.
[01:43.360 --> 01:45.760]  I may have a family emergency pop up here.
[01:45.760 --> 01:50.400]  If so, we're going to have to adjust on the fly, but I'm getting very good at that.
[01:50.400 --> 01:54.000]  We're going to hope that everything works out properly, and I'll be back Monday with
[01:54.000 --> 01:59.120]  a full length podcast about pheno hunting, about sexing, and about mother plants.
[01:59.120 --> 02:01.600]  Now let's get into this Thursday episode.
[02:01.600 --> 02:06.600]  In this episode, I want to talk about a little adventure I got to take over the weekend.
[02:06.600 --> 02:12.600]  Thursday, I headed down to Albuquerque, New Mexico to attend the Chronicle Magazine Bud
[02:12.600 --> 02:14.560]  Bowl, which was a great event.
[02:14.560 --> 02:18.600]  It happened at a place called Noah's in Albuquerque.
[02:18.600 --> 02:20.240]  It started off with a super smooth drive.
[02:20.240 --> 02:22.600]  It was about a five hour journey down to Albuquerque.
[02:23.200 --> 02:25.840]  That was very uneventful, just basically a straight shot.
[02:25.840 --> 02:28.240]  You can almost autopilot that whole drive.
[02:28.240 --> 02:31.920]  I boogied down to Albuquerque, and I met up with a good friend of mine, who I'm not sure
[02:31.920 --> 02:35.520]  if he wants all of his identity revealed here on the podcast.
[02:35.520 --> 02:38.000]  He met me at the hotel that he had set up for me.
[02:38.000 --> 02:42.840]  He arrived to the hotel with concentrates, with a dab rig, with a fresh banger, with
[02:42.840 --> 02:44.600]  a torch, with a carb cap.
[02:44.600 --> 02:50.240]  He had everything I needed to be able to properly medicate myself for my adventure.
[02:50.240 --> 02:52.200]  That was great to land at the hotel.
[02:52.800 --> 02:54.880]  I could take off my shoes and take some dabs immediately.
[02:54.880 --> 02:56.360]  That was a very warm welcome.
[02:56.360 --> 02:58.960]  Hey, dude, thanks for the great hospitality.
[02:58.960 --> 03:02.040]  Over the entire adventure, that was just the start of things.
[03:02.040 --> 03:03.040]  We hung out in the hotel.
[03:03.040 --> 03:05.460]  A few of my New Mexico friends came through.
[03:05.460 --> 03:07.160]  We may have taken a few dabs in the hotel.
[03:07.160 --> 03:09.240]  We may have not taken a bunch of dabs in the hotel.
[03:09.240 --> 03:10.240]  You never know.
[03:10.240 --> 03:13.400]  Then, after we were properly medicated, we headed to dinner.
[03:13.400 --> 03:16.680]  A few of us went and had dinner at a nice little spot there in Albuquerque.
[03:17.160 --> 03:22.440]  Then after that, we gathered up and headed to the Chronicle Bud Bowl at a place called
[03:22.440 --> 03:23.440]  Noah's.
[03:23.440 --> 03:26.960]  Noah's appeared to be a pretty classy little joint.
[03:26.960 --> 03:29.260]  I like the setup of that place.
[03:29.260 --> 03:32.640]  When you walked in, it was kind of like a little banquet hall sort of a thing.
[03:32.640 --> 03:36.680]  It was wide open, but then they had tables and chairs set up to where you could sit kind
[03:36.680 --> 03:38.160]  of restaurant style.
[03:38.160 --> 03:43.040]  All of the tables had candles and other inviting decorative items on them.
[03:43.040 --> 03:44.200]  There was a DJ playing.
[03:44.200 --> 03:46.360]  In my opinion, the DJ was a little bit too loud.
[03:47.040 --> 03:49.280]  I might be getting old, but I couldn't hear my friends.
[03:49.280 --> 03:51.720]  I was talking to all of my friends from New Mexico.
[03:51.720 --> 03:54.960]  When the music is just overwhelmingly loud, it's hard to communicate with your friends
[03:54.960 --> 03:55.960]  and with your new friends.
[03:55.960 --> 03:59.560]  You just end up cutting the conversation short and walking away because you don't want to
[03:59.560 --> 04:01.240]  compete with that DJ.
[04:01.240 --> 04:02.680]  For the most part, it was a great event.
[04:02.680 --> 04:04.800]  It was set up very beautifully.
[04:04.800 --> 04:05.960]  I liked the lighting in there.
[04:05.960 --> 04:07.560]  I liked the environment of the room.
[04:07.560 --> 04:09.960]  It had a really nice atmosphere in the building.
[04:09.960 --> 04:12.520]  I just liked the whole setup and the vibe in there.
[04:12.520 --> 04:16.040]  The room I hung out in was mostly like the banquet room.
[04:16.720 --> 04:18.800]  It was also where they had the tables with the entries lined up.
[04:18.800 --> 04:20.800]  We're going to talk about that in just a second.
[04:20.800 --> 04:22.080]  There were several other rooms.
[04:22.080 --> 04:25.200]  There was another room where they had a ping pong table and a big screen TV.
[04:25.200 --> 04:28.360]  It kind of had more like a college kind of vibe going on in there.
[04:28.360 --> 04:31.640]  Then there were a couple of other rooms, but it was all one big loop.
[04:31.640 --> 04:33.720]  You could just walk through the place.
[04:33.720 --> 04:34.720]  It wasn't like separate rooms.
[04:34.720 --> 04:36.280]  It was just like separate areas.
[04:36.280 --> 04:37.720]  It wasn't sectioned off.
[04:37.720 --> 04:39.280]  It was a really cool, stylish place.
[04:39.280 --> 04:43.280]  If you ever get a chance to go to an event at Noah's, I would go check it out.
[04:43.760 --> 04:47.800]  Do not expect to be able to consume any type of cannabis in Noah's.
[04:47.800 --> 04:50.280]  They frown upon consumption.
[04:50.280 --> 04:55.120]  We did take some dabs, and we were promptly told to take that shit outside.
[04:55.120 --> 04:57.160]  So don't think you can dab in there.
[04:57.160 --> 04:58.000]  Don't go do that.
[04:58.000 --> 04:59.080]  Don't get your selfie all that.
[04:59.080 --> 05:00.760]  It doesn't feel good.
[05:00.760 --> 05:04.480]  We were, however, told that we were welcome to dab outside or smoke outside,
[05:04.480 --> 05:07.200]  which we totally took advantage of that opportunity.
[05:07.200 --> 05:11.240]  Big shout out to everybody who kept me medicated all weekend long.
[05:11.280 --> 05:13.880]  Since I drove from Colorado down to New Mexico,
[05:13.880 --> 05:16.000]  I opted not to take anything with me.
[05:16.000 --> 05:18.640]  I'm coming across state lines with Colorado plates.
[05:18.640 --> 05:20.200]  I'm a white guy with dreadlocks.
[05:20.200 --> 05:22.240]  They're going to want to see what's in my car.
[05:22.240 --> 05:25.800]  But I honestly didn't see any law enforcement until I got into Albuquerque.
[05:25.800 --> 05:29.600]  There was a nice wreck somewhere between Santa Fe and Albuquerque on I-25.
[05:29.600 --> 05:33.560]  That was the first law enforcement that I saw on the entire trip.
[05:33.560 --> 05:36.280]  Either way, I'm glad I didn't take anything with me, because if I did,
[05:36.280 --> 05:39.880]  I'm sure I would have gotten pulled over as soon as I got into New Mexico.
[05:39.920 --> 05:41.560]  That's just the way it works.
[05:41.560 --> 05:43.760]  So I had to show up to all of these events empty-handed.
[05:43.760 --> 05:47.040]  Usually I show up with plenty of dabs, with my own rig, with my own torch.
[05:47.040 --> 05:49.640]  I had to follow my friends around and wait to be offered dabs.
[05:49.640 --> 05:51.640]  Honestly, I never needed a dab.
[05:51.640 --> 05:54.440]  I never got to that point where I was like, huh, I could go for a dab.
[05:54.440 --> 05:57.240]  They kept me well-dabbed the entire time.
[05:57.240 --> 05:58.480]  So big thanks to everybody.
[05:58.480 --> 05:59.400]  You guys know who you are.
[05:59.400 --> 06:01.080]  I'm not going to try to shout anybody out right now,
[06:01.080 --> 06:04.000]  because I will miss somebody, and then I will feel bad.
[06:04.000 --> 06:08.720]  Now, a minute ago, I mentioned they had some tables with all of the entries on display.
[06:08.720 --> 06:13.000]  I really appreciated being able to see all of the entries lined up in jars.
[06:13.000 --> 06:14.960]  They were all numbered and labeled, so we could look at them
[06:14.960 --> 06:16.800]  and then make notes if we wanted to.
[06:16.800 --> 06:19.440]  They had three or four long dining tables lined up,
[06:19.440 --> 06:21.960]  and on each of those tables, they would have a label,
[06:21.960 --> 06:24.960]  if this was Indica, if it was Sativa, if it was Hybrid.
[06:24.960 --> 06:29.520]  Then they had a CBD section, and they also had what was called the PPL,
[06:29.520 --> 06:31.840]  which I realized is the private grower entries.
[06:31.840 --> 06:34.240]  The other ones were all from what are called producers.
[06:34.240 --> 06:37.360]  In New Mexico, the dispensary grows are called producers,
[06:37.360 --> 06:40.000]  and the home grows were labeled as PPL.
[06:40.000 --> 06:42.080]  I'm not sure what PPL stands for exactly.
[06:42.080 --> 06:46.360]  I bet one of my New Mexico friends will send me a message as soon as they hear this.
[06:46.360 --> 06:49.520]  So they had the tables all set up, and then you would just go look at the jars.
[06:49.520 --> 06:52.160]  They had a bunch of jars on the table, and every jar was numbered,
[06:52.160 --> 06:54.520]  one through however many there were.
[06:54.520 --> 06:57.800]  Most of the tables had approximately 30 jars.
[06:57.800 --> 07:00.120]  There were approximately 30 Sativa entries.
[07:00.120 --> 07:04.760]  There were approximately 30 Indica and approximately 30 Hybrid entries.
[07:04.760 --> 07:08.480]  There were not as many CBD entries, but there were plenty to look through,
[07:08.480 --> 07:12.480]  and there were also quite a few PPL entries.
[07:12.480 --> 07:17.120]  I would guess there were about 120 total samples for me to open the jar
[07:17.120 --> 07:21.640]  and give a nice smell to and try to take notes on and remember what I enjoyed.
[07:21.640 --> 07:25.840]  I think I just randomly started at the Hybrid table because that's where I was standing,
[07:25.840 --> 07:30.080]  and I think what I remember from the Hybrid table was a Stardog entry.
[07:30.080 --> 07:33.800]  That was the one that stood out to me the most on the Hybrid table.
[07:33.840 --> 07:36.480]  Then I moved on to the Indica table.
[07:36.480 --> 07:40.160]  The entry that stood out the most to me on the Indica table was number 25,
[07:40.160 --> 07:43.200]  which I later learned was a Hellfire OG.
[07:43.200 --> 07:45.400]  I do not think that is my Hellfire OG.
[07:45.400 --> 07:47.480]  I think that is across from somebody else.
[07:47.480 --> 07:51.320]  I didn't realize that name was already taken when I named that strain,
[07:51.320 --> 07:54.520]  so my Hellfire OG is now discontinued.
[07:54.520 --> 07:55.520]  I don't make it anymore.
[07:55.520 --> 07:56.640]  Somebody else already has it.
[07:56.640 --> 08:01.520]  There's no need for me to cause any sort of confusion over strain names.
[08:01.560 --> 08:05.400]  Being a Sativa head, I tried to save that Sativa table for last
[08:05.400 --> 08:07.120]  because I knew that was going to be my favorite.
[08:07.120 --> 08:09.360]  I tried to spoil myself and save the best for last.
[08:09.360 --> 08:10.560]  That's just how I am.
[08:10.560 --> 08:16.240]  I also knew that there were some people who had entered a rise in that category.
[08:16.240 --> 08:18.960]  I've got to be honest, one of the jars that I opened,
[08:18.960 --> 08:22.200]  I knew almost immediately that was my rise.
[08:22.200 --> 08:26.440]  They had a very Golden Goat dominant phenotype of my rise.
[08:26.440 --> 08:28.200]  That cut is a champion.
[08:28.200 --> 08:30.480]  They have got a great phenotype.
[08:30.480 --> 08:33.560]  There was no doubt in my mind as soon as I cracked open that jar
[08:33.560 --> 08:34.680]  and the aroma hit me, I said,
[08:34.680 --> 08:35.520]  oh, that's a rise.
[08:35.520 --> 08:37.320]  Then I looked at it and I saw the bud structure.
[08:37.320 --> 08:40.440]  I said, oh, that's a Golden Goat dominant phenotype of a rise.
[08:40.440 --> 08:42.480]  By the appearance of that one bud,
[08:42.480 --> 08:44.720]  I felt like that was the best Sativa entry.
[08:44.720 --> 08:46.560]  I was trying not to be biased.
[08:46.560 --> 08:53.160]  I also smelled a Sour Tangy entry in the Sativa category that smelled phenomenal.
[08:53.160 --> 08:57.320]  That Sour Tangy gave the arise a really good run for its money.
[08:57.320 --> 08:59.920]  Eventually, it was time to give out the awards.
[08:59.960 --> 09:00.840]  It was a bud bowl.
[09:00.840 --> 09:02.040]  It was a bud competition.
[09:02.040 --> 09:03.680]  It was time to give out some awards.
[09:03.680 --> 09:07.200]  The awards were some of the heaviest trophies I have ever seen.
[09:07.200 --> 09:09.840]  Oh my God, you can't tell when I'm holding the trophy in the picture,
[09:09.840 --> 09:11.480]  but that trophy was super heavy.
[09:11.480 --> 09:13.800]  We're going to talk more about that here in just a second.
[09:13.800 --> 09:15.720]  The award ceremony was a little different
[09:15.720 --> 09:19.640]  than any other Cannabis Cup award ceremony I've been to.
[09:19.640 --> 09:23.200]  In most cases, they will say, okay, first, second, and third for hybrid,
[09:23.200 --> 09:24.400]  and they would announce third place.
[09:24.400 --> 09:27.360]  They would say, the winner for third place in hybrid is,
[09:27.360 --> 09:29.320]  whatever, I'm trying to pick a hybrid strain,
[09:29.320 --> 09:32.760]  Grateful Dog, and then Grown by whoever.
[09:32.760 --> 09:34.840]  They'd say, Grateful Dog, Grown by iReed Genetics.
[09:34.840 --> 09:37.760]  Then I would go up there and everybody would know that my Grateful Dog
[09:37.760 --> 09:40.080]  and me just won that award.
[09:40.080 --> 09:42.240]  The way that they were doing it at this event,
[09:42.240 --> 09:44.880]  the guy just said, okay, the hybrid category,
[09:44.880 --> 09:47.040]  third place winner was this person.
[09:47.040 --> 09:48.480]  I didn't know what the strain was.
[09:48.480 --> 09:49.960]  I didn't know what their entry was.
[09:49.960 --> 09:51.840]  I had to actually yell, what strain was it?
[09:51.840 --> 09:55.080]  So that I could find out what they had entered and what they had won with.
[09:55.080 --> 09:58.320]  I don't know that they cared what the genetics were or what the entry was,
[09:58.320 --> 10:02.520]  as long as everybody knew that specific dispensary had just won an award.
[10:02.520 --> 10:05.440]  That's the only point I think they were trying to get across.
[10:05.440 --> 10:08.360]  It's common in the cannabis culture when an award is given
[10:08.360 --> 10:10.000]  that you list the genetics that won.
[10:10.000 --> 10:13.040]  So you could say, this strain won, it was grown by this person,
[10:13.040 --> 10:15.840]  and then you list the dispensary where it may be available.
[10:15.840 --> 10:18.240]  It's all a team, a cohesive effort.
[10:18.240 --> 10:21.880]  At this place, they only cared about the dispensary getting some notoriety,
[10:21.880 --> 10:22.720]  which is just fine.
[10:22.720 --> 10:24.720]  I wasn't there to receive anything.
[10:24.720 --> 10:27.040]  I didn't know that any of my strains were going to win any awards,
[10:27.040 --> 10:28.440]  but let's jump into that.
[10:28.440 --> 10:31.400]  I'm really glad that I yelled, what strain was that?
[10:31.400 --> 10:38.040]  Because Arise won two awards at the Albuquerque Chronicle Bud Bowl.
[10:38.040 --> 10:38.720]  That's right.
[10:38.720 --> 10:41.240]  Arise, which is Golden Goat crossed to Daybreaker,
[10:41.240 --> 10:47.360]  won first place for best hybrid and also third place for best sativa.
[10:47.360 --> 10:50.480]  Now, you may say, how did one strain win two categories?
[10:50.480 --> 10:52.720]  It is honestly a sativa dominant hybrid.
[10:52.720 --> 10:55.680]  So I can see how it would be entered into the sativa category.
[10:55.720 --> 10:59.240]  And I said the word hybrid, so it is absolutely a hybrid.
[10:59.240 --> 11:01.920]  It can qualify for two categories.
[11:01.920 --> 11:04.360]  So I want to give a huge shout out to my new friend, Darren,
[11:04.360 --> 11:07.560]  from Everest Apothecary in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
[11:07.560 --> 11:10.880]  Darren and I had never met before, so it was an honor and a pleasure
[11:10.880 --> 11:13.960]  to meet him and shake his hand and congratulate him for his win
[11:13.960 --> 11:15.400]  with the genetics that I bred.
[11:15.400 --> 11:16.800]  He didn't even know I bred it.
[11:16.800 --> 11:18.120]  I was like, hey, bro, what strain was that?
[11:18.120 --> 11:19.360]  And he goes, Arise.
[11:19.360 --> 11:21.160]  And I looked at him, I go, bro, I bred that.
[11:21.160 --> 11:22.400]  And his eyes lit up like, what?
[11:22.400 --> 11:24.560]  And then we stood up and talked to each other for a few minutes.
[11:24.560 --> 11:26.720]  It was bromance at first sight.
[11:26.720 --> 11:28.520]  So big congratulations to Darren.
[11:28.520 --> 11:30.760]  Dude, thanks for the great work with my genetics.
[11:30.760 --> 11:32.240]  Make sure you guys check out my Instagram.
[11:32.240 --> 11:37.600]  I posted a picture of Darren and myself holding those heavy ass trophies.
[11:37.600 --> 11:39.200]  We're trying not to look like they're heavy.
[11:39.200 --> 11:40.480]  Those are the heaviest trophies ever.
[11:40.480 --> 11:43.200]  That glass part at the top, that is all filled in with glass.
[11:43.200 --> 11:44.200]  Those aren't hollow.
[11:44.200 --> 11:45.880]  Those are filled with glass.
[11:45.880 --> 11:47.440]  You can't pour anything in there.
[11:47.440 --> 11:48.800]  They're heavy.
[11:48.800 --> 11:51.080]  So overall, I think it was a great event.
[11:51.080 --> 11:54.000]  Even if one of my strains did not win two awards,
[11:54.000 --> 11:55.640]  I still would have had a great time.
[11:55.640 --> 11:58.440]  The awards were just a bonus, just icing on the cake.
[11:58.440 --> 11:59.320]  I had a great time.
[11:59.320 --> 12:02.160]  I was surrounded by good friends and great company.
[12:02.160 --> 12:03.760]  I made a lot of new friends.
[12:03.760 --> 12:06.800]  I got to meet a lot of the people that follow me on social media.
[12:06.800 --> 12:11.880]  And I got to meet a lot of the prominent members of the New Mexico cannabis
[12:11.880 --> 12:12.920]  community.
[12:12.920 --> 12:17.640]  And it was really an honor to be welcomed so kindly and so warmly by everybody.
[12:17.640 --> 12:19.680]  Everybody in New Mexico was excited to see me.
[12:19.680 --> 12:22.000]  They were all super kind and super polite.
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.960]  They've got a great little cannabis community down there.
[12:24.960 --> 12:26.080]  You guys, I'll be back.
[12:26.080 --> 12:27.560]  I look forward to coming back and hanging out.
[12:27.560 --> 12:30.360]  There are a few people that I didn't get to get my selfie with.
[12:30.360 --> 12:31.640]  So when I come back, line up.
[12:31.640 --> 12:33.480]  We're taking some pictures, you guys.
[12:33.480 --> 12:36.400]  So that was day one of my adventure in Albuquerque.
[12:36.400 --> 12:40.800]  I headed back to the hotel, took a bunch more dabs in the hotel, maybe.
[12:40.800 --> 12:42.160]  Got some rest.
[12:42.160 --> 12:49.120]  Then the next day, I got to visit the Organica Grow facility and the Organica
[12:49.120 --> 12:51.600]  store as a visitor in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
[12:51.600 --> 12:53.040]  I got to go take a little tour.
[12:53.040 --> 12:54.160]  Got to go check out the grow.
[12:54.160 --> 12:58.800]  Got to go see all the growers and all of the Irie Genetics plants in the Organica
[12:58.800 --> 12:59.160]  garden.
[12:59.160 --> 13:00.720]  It was really great to walk through.
[13:00.720 --> 13:02.120]  And they were like, yeah, there's a Rize.
[13:02.120 --> 13:02.840]  That's the Cream.
[13:02.840 --> 13:04.440]  That's Scarlet Begonias.
[13:04.440 --> 13:06.480]  They've got a lot of great Irie stuff in their garden.
[13:06.480 --> 13:08.000]  And it looks really good.
[13:08.000 --> 13:11.600]  It's always great to walk through a grow and see your genetics just kicking ass
[13:11.600 --> 13:13.200]  throughout the whole grow.
[13:13.200 --> 13:14.320]  So that was a really great time.
[13:14.320 --> 13:17.480]  I actually got to put on some gloves and play in the Organica garden for a few
[13:17.480 --> 13:19.600]  minutes, which was really a really good time.
[13:19.600 --> 13:22.680]  I really enjoyed getting in there with those youngsters and having a little grow
[13:22.680 --> 13:24.120]  session with them.
[13:24.120 --> 13:27.120]  I want to give a bunch of shout outs to all of my New Mexico crew.
[13:27.120 --> 13:28.960]  Huge, huge shout out to Tim.
[13:28.960 --> 13:30.480]  An extra huge shout out to Amy.
[13:30.480 --> 13:32.760]  Of course, shout outs to both of the Davids.
[13:32.760 --> 13:34.360]  A huge shout out to Canna Grandma.
[13:34.360 --> 13:36.320]  I finally got my picture with Canna Grandma.
[13:36.320 --> 13:36.720]  Thank you.
[13:36.720 --> 13:38.400]  That means a lot to me.
[13:38.400 --> 13:40.280]  Big shout out to Miles.
[13:40.280 --> 13:42.440]  Bro, Miles, you're killing it, bro.
[13:42.440 --> 13:44.920]  I want to give a huge get well shout out to my buddy Pryor.
[13:44.920 --> 13:46.280]  Hey, bro, get well, bro.
[13:46.320 --> 13:47.520]  That looks like it hurts.
[13:47.520 --> 13:49.280]  Also, a big shout out to Mark.
[13:49.280 --> 13:52.680]  A big, huge hug and a shout out to my buddy Huggy Duggy.
[13:52.680 --> 13:56.600]  Also, not part of Organica, but still a part of my New Mexico family.
[13:56.600 --> 13:58.000]  Big shout out to Ashley.
[13:58.000 --> 13:59.760]  Big shout out to Cassandra.
[13:59.760 --> 14:03.640]  And also, a big old one of those where you do a handshake and you pull the guy in and
[14:03.640 --> 14:04.640]  you just pat him on the shoulder.
[14:04.640 --> 14:06.400]  You do like a thug hug.
[14:06.400 --> 14:08.280]  A big old thug hug to my boy Deez.
[14:08.280 --> 14:08.760]  What up, dog?
[14:08.760 --> 14:09.800]  I hope you're well.
[14:09.800 --> 14:13.480]  And also, while I'm giving out shout outs, I cannot forget my buddy Brad Wines.
[14:13.480 --> 14:15.800]  Brad, dude, it was so much fun hanging out with you.
[14:15.840 --> 14:18.200]  Just trying to find a good spot to put you in here and make sure that your shout out
[14:18.200 --> 14:18.880]  stands out.
[14:18.880 --> 14:21.080]  Dude, Brad, shout out, brother.
[14:21.080 --> 14:22.640]  Brad and I have been friends for quite a while.
[14:22.640 --> 14:26.240]  Haven't seen him in far too long, so it was good to go take some New Mexico dabs with
[14:26.240 --> 14:27.440]  Brad on his turf.
[14:27.440 --> 14:31.400]  He's always here in Colorado, so it was fun to finally dab out on your turf.
[14:31.400 --> 14:33.240]  Also, I want to give a shout out to Wendy.
[14:33.240 --> 14:34.400]  It was great meeting you.
[14:34.400 --> 14:35.560]  Also, a shout out to Erica.
[14:35.560 --> 14:37.800]  It was great finally meeting you face to face.
[14:37.800 --> 14:39.120]  And a big shout out to Matt.
[14:39.120 --> 14:40.560]  I saw that you had a little car crash.
[14:40.560 --> 14:42.160]  I hope you're doing well, brother.
[14:42.160 --> 14:45.400]  There are a lot of people in New Mexico that I wish I could include on this list of shout
[14:45.520 --> 14:48.760]  outs, but it is starting to feel like some sort of weird award show.
[14:48.760 --> 14:51.480]  So, big shout out to everybody in New Mexico.
[14:51.480 --> 14:53.160]  You guys treated me like royalty.
[14:53.160 --> 14:54.640]  You made me feel like family.
[14:54.640 --> 14:55.640]  I will be back.
[14:55.640 --> 14:58.600]  We are going to have a lot of fun in New Mexico.
[14:58.600 --> 15:00.200]  Look forward to it.
[15:00.200 --> 15:04.520]  It was really humbling and enlightening to go to a place where, first of all, I am not
[15:04.520 --> 15:05.600]  allowed to have cannabis.
[15:05.600 --> 15:07.720]  I cannot be in possession of cannabis.
[15:07.720 --> 15:08.720]  That is illegal.
[15:08.720 --> 15:09.960]  It feels really weird.
[15:09.960 --> 15:10.960]  I live in Colorado.
[15:10.960 --> 15:12.840]  I can go to the store and buy cannabis.
[15:12.840 --> 15:17.440]  I can have my products with me as long as they're properly packaged and carried correctly.
[15:17.440 --> 15:21.960]  I can have all my products, my medicine, and the equipment that I need to use that medicine.
[15:21.960 --> 15:23.080]  I can have my dab rig.
[15:23.080 --> 15:24.080]  I can have my pipe.
[15:24.080 --> 15:25.080]  I can have a torch.
[15:25.080 --> 15:26.080]  I can have a dabber.
[15:26.080 --> 15:27.080]  I can have a carb cap.
[15:27.080 --> 15:31.360]  I can have everything necessary to administer my medicine properly as long as I carry it
[15:31.360 --> 15:34.420]  in a legal fashion and I am in the state of Colorado.
[15:34.420 --> 15:36.360]  In New Mexico, that's not an option for me.
[15:36.360 --> 15:38.000]  I'm not a New Mexico resident.
[15:38.000 --> 15:39.880]  They don't have recreational cannabis there.
[15:39.880 --> 15:40.880]  It felt kind of weird.
[15:40.920 --> 15:45.640]  It reminded me to kind of think about how people feel in non-legal states when I'm giving
[15:45.640 --> 15:49.360]  advice and when I'm talking about cannabis and I talk about how spoiled I am.
[15:49.360 --> 15:51.680]  It kind of reminded me how you folks feel.
[15:51.680 --> 15:52.840]  You got to watch your back.
[15:52.840 --> 15:53.840]  You've got to be careful.
[15:53.840 --> 15:58.600]  A lot of people in New Mexico were giving me gifts, so I was politely accepting those
[15:58.600 --> 15:59.600]  gifts.
[15:59.600 --> 16:02.920]  I later realized all this shit in my backpack is completely illegal.
[16:02.920 --> 16:04.120]  I'm not allowed to have this.
[16:04.120 --> 16:07.200]  It was really a strange feeling to realize I am committing a crime.
[16:07.200 --> 16:12.400]  I am fully illegal just because I crossed a little invisible line.
[16:12.400 --> 16:16.200]  Much respect to all you folks out there in the illegal states, the non-legal states.
[16:16.200 --> 16:20.560]  I had a little glimpse of what that's like again, and it's a shitty feeling.
[16:20.560 --> 16:26.560]  It was also humbling and enlightening to see New Mexico at the infancy of cannabis legalization.
[16:26.560 --> 16:32.560]  I have been a part of the legalization movement in Colorado since around 2007-ish, I can say
[16:32.560 --> 16:34.420]  confidently.
[16:34.420 --> 16:38.580]  I was doing other things kind of black market wise and shit before that, but I didn't get
[16:38.580 --> 16:44.820]  into the legal cannabis market until 2007 or 2008 when a bunch of friends and myself
[16:44.820 --> 16:48.940]  were involved in the very first dispensary in the city of Pueblo.
[16:48.940 --> 16:55.420]  We were quickly shut down due to illegal legal reasons, but we were still part of the very
[16:55.420 --> 16:58.900]  first dispensary here and that was 10 years ago.
[16:58.900 --> 17:02.660]  So I've got a 10 year headstart on the cannabis industry.
[17:02.740 --> 17:07.820]  When I go to New Mexico, they're very new and it was really neat to see how they're
[17:07.820 --> 17:08.820]  starting.
[17:08.820 --> 17:13.300]  It reminded me of where our roots were and the potential of what they have got in those
[17:13.300 --> 17:15.020]  buildings and in their stores.
[17:15.020 --> 17:19.020]  I really can't wait to go do more work with all of my New Mexico friends.
[17:19.020 --> 17:23.780]  It was a very humbling reminder of my roots and a reminder of where I started and where
[17:23.780 --> 17:28.660]  this game began and how far this game can go and where those people in those buildings,
[17:28.660 --> 17:32.620]  they don't realize that they are revolutionaries in their state right now.
[17:32.620 --> 17:37.300]  They're starting something serious and in the next five, seven and 10 years, they're
[17:37.300 --> 17:40.460]  going to be prominent members of the cannabis community.
[17:40.460 --> 17:44.300]  It's really fun to look at people that don't realize that that's who they are becoming
[17:44.300 --> 17:47.300]  and watch them develop into those positions.
[17:47.300 --> 17:51.060]  I saw some great young talent while I was down there in New Mexico and I cannot wait
[17:51.060 --> 17:55.640]  to see what those youngsters make of themselves in this industry.
[17:55.640 --> 18:00.620]  Another thing that really stood out to me in New Mexico is that there was no legal consumption.
[18:00.620 --> 18:06.980]  We were at a cannabis event and we were frowned upon for trying to smoke dabs inside.
[18:06.980 --> 18:07.980]  I get it.
[18:07.980 --> 18:08.980]  Rules are rules.
[18:08.980 --> 18:14.660]  But if you're going to invite us to a cup event where there is cannabis to be judged,
[18:14.660 --> 18:17.060]  let me smoke some cannabis in that building.
[18:17.060 --> 18:20.500]  That brings me to one of my most popular rants.
[18:20.500 --> 18:25.720]  If you were working on legalization efforts in your area, be sure to include some sort
[18:25.720 --> 18:28.420]  of safe consumption sites.
[18:28.420 --> 18:32.320]  We need somewhere to smoke all of this cannabis we are buying.
[18:32.320 --> 18:37.020]  People that come to Colorado from other states do not have a safe place to consume their
[18:37.020 --> 18:38.020]  cannabis.
[18:38.020 --> 18:42.720]  There are very limited places for people to consume cannabis safely and most of those
[18:42.720 --> 18:44.900]  places are very hard to find.
[18:44.900 --> 18:45.900]  They are not advertised.
[18:45.900 --> 18:49.340]  They're kind of word of mouth and it's very hush hush.
[18:49.340 --> 18:53.580]  So Colorado is happy to take your tax money and take your purchase money for a fat sack
[18:53.580 --> 18:56.400]  of cannabis, but you can't smoke it anywhere.
[18:56.400 --> 18:58.340]  We don't want you smoking in the hotels.
[18:58.380 --> 18:59.900]  You can't smoke in state parks.
[18:59.900 --> 19:01.420]  You can't smoke in your car.
[19:01.420 --> 19:04.940]  If you came from out of town and you bought some cannabis, you basically have to break
[19:04.940 --> 19:07.460]  the rules to consume that cannabis.
[19:07.460 --> 19:12.700]  The only safe option that we have thought of is smoking in an Airbnb and your Airbnb
[19:12.700 --> 19:16.740]  host can ban you from consuming cannabis there as well.
[19:16.740 --> 19:21.580]  So to make a long rant short, when you were developing the rules for recreational adult
[19:21.580 --> 19:29.060]  use cannabis in your area, please consider making rules about somewhere to safely congregate
[19:29.060 --> 19:31.500]  and consume your cannabis.
[19:31.500 --> 19:36.540]  I feel like we really need somewhere for cannabis consumers to safely congregate and consume
[19:36.540 --> 19:41.260]  cannabis in a social setting, just like we do with alcohol.
[19:41.260 --> 19:46.140]  We have figured out how to congregate and consume alcohol in a mostly responsible, mostly
[19:46.140 --> 19:47.140]  adult manner.
[19:47.140 --> 19:48.140]  Don't get me wrong.
[19:48.140 --> 19:52.220]  We do have tons of shitheads when it comes to alcohol, but for the most part, we do it.
[19:52.220 --> 19:53.220]  It happens.
[19:53.220 --> 19:56.180]  There are people at the bar right now drinking and they're going to make it home safely.
[19:56.180 --> 19:58.500]  Why can't we do this with cannabis?
[19:58.500 --> 20:00.500]  I don't think I need to convince any of you of this.
[20:00.500 --> 20:04.700]  I think we are all on the same page, but those of you who are out there doing the political
[20:04.700 --> 20:09.020]  fight, please work to include some sort of consumption rules when you are making the
[20:09.020 --> 20:11.180]  rules for your area.
[20:11.180 --> 20:12.220]  You don't have to go crazy.
[20:12.220 --> 20:14.860]  I don't want to be able to walk down the street and hit my dab rig.
[20:14.860 --> 20:19.420]  I would like somewhere I can go and meet my friends and we can take some dabs together.
[20:19.420 --> 20:21.340]  Wouldn't it be cool if I could text you?
[20:21.340 --> 20:23.340]  I was going to say if I could call you, but that made me feel old.
[20:23.340 --> 20:25.060]  Wouldn't it be cool if I could text you?
[20:25.060 --> 20:29.100]  And I said, hey bro, I'm going to go over to Apothecary and pick up some banana OG,
[20:29.100 --> 20:31.460]  then I'll meet you over at the 710 club.
[20:31.460 --> 20:33.380]  And then you said, man, you're going to get the banana OG?
[20:33.380 --> 20:36.300]  I'm going to get the pre-98 Bubba Kush and I'll meet you over there.
[20:36.300 --> 20:37.980]  And then we both hit the dispensary.
[20:37.980 --> 20:40.100]  We go over to the dab club and we just hang out.
[20:40.100 --> 20:41.100]  We take a couple of dabs.
[20:41.100 --> 20:43.380]  I get to taste your pre-98 Bubba Kush.
[20:43.380 --> 20:45.940]  You get to taste my Bubba Banana OG.
[20:45.940 --> 20:49.940]  I forgot what strains I created for this scenario, but we get to share concentrates.
[20:49.940 --> 20:51.900]  We get to hang out.
[20:51.900 --> 20:55.220]  Probably this place is going to be smart and they're going to sell some kind of snacks.
[20:55.220 --> 20:56.660]  Hey, just some advice.
[20:56.660 --> 20:57.660]  This is really random.
[20:57.660 --> 21:02.260]  If you're going to sell snacks to stoners who are politely congregating in your smoke
[21:02.260 --> 21:06.060]  lounge or your dab club, stop pumping them full of crap.
[21:06.060 --> 21:12.300]  Offer them some healthy, wholesome snacks at a premium price and they will pay for it.
[21:12.300 --> 21:18.020]  I do not want to buy a can of Coke and a bag of chips when I'm dabbing to try to maintain
[21:18.020 --> 21:19.020]  my health.
[21:19.020 --> 21:24.300]  I would rather pay a few extra bucks for some sort of organic yumminess and some sort of
[21:24.300 --> 21:27.580]  delicious drink when I'm lit up than some sugary crap.
[21:27.580 --> 21:31.820]  So if you want to start some sort of a place where you can consume and serve not super
[21:31.820 --> 21:35.740]  expensive snacks, but some kind of just not chips and sugar.
[21:35.740 --> 21:36.780]  We don't want cookies.
[21:36.780 --> 21:41.180]  Maybe some people do, but you would be doing more of a service to the community if you
[21:41.180 --> 21:44.340]  offered something a little more healthy and a better option.
[21:44.340 --> 21:47.900]  And you may encourage some of these stoners to feed themselves a little bit better.
[21:47.900 --> 21:52.620]  And I would be more likely to buy some stuff that wasn't just movie theater kind of crap.
[21:52.620 --> 21:53.780]  That's my opinion.
[21:53.780 --> 21:54.940]  That's my idea.
[21:54.940 --> 21:57.500]  Let's get my high ass back on track.
[21:57.500 --> 22:02.580]  My point is when you're writing the rules, please include some sort of consumption area
[22:02.580 --> 22:04.820]  because that's what we're lacking here in Colorado.
[22:04.820 --> 22:06.900]  That's what they're lacking in New Mexico.
[22:06.900 --> 22:10.700]  Don't lack that in your cool new legalization movements.
[22:10.700 --> 22:13.580]  All right, Podcast World, I'm going to wrap up this show.
[22:13.580 --> 22:14.780]  I want to thank you for listening.
[22:14.780 --> 22:17.900]  I want to thank everybody in New Mexico again for the hospitality.
[22:17.900 --> 22:19.820]  I will be back and I look forward to it.
[22:19.820 --> 22:21.560]  Let's go get some green chili.

[23:26.180 --> 23:27.940]  Thanks for hanging out with me for a random episode.
[23:27.940 --> 23:30.340]  You guys, I know there was not a lot of grow talk in this episode.
[23:30.780 --> 23:34.180]  Again, I do have a very ill family member, so I'm a little more focused on him right
[23:34.180 --> 23:35.540]  now than a podcast.
[23:35.540 --> 23:39.020]  I want to knock out a quick Thursday episode so I can focus on the Monday episode.
[23:39.020 --> 23:42.100]  Then I can chill out and kind of worry about my family a little bit.
[23:42.100 --> 23:44.860]  If everything goes well, I'll be back Monday with the grow lesson.
[23:44.860 --> 23:46.420]  We're going to talk about pheno hunting.
[23:46.420 --> 23:48.020]  We'll talk about finding a mother plant.
[23:48.020 --> 23:50.460]  And in that process, we are going to be sexing our plants.
[23:50.460 --> 23:52.980]  It's all one big project that happens all at the same time.
[23:52.980 --> 23:54.900]  It'll be a great grow lesson.
[23:54.900 --> 23:57.220]  I really look forward to getting that out to you Monday.
[23:57.220 --> 23:59.540]  I hope everybody has a good, safe weekend.
[23:59.580 --> 24:01.580]  I look forward to meeting with you in just a couple of days.
[24:01.580 --> 24:03.740]  I want to give a huge shout out to Miles Turner.
[24:03.740 --> 24:04.980]  You're killing it, bro.
[24:04.980 --> 24:08.460]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
