[00:00.890 --> 00:06.330]  Happy New Year, Podcast World! I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is
[00:06.330 --> 00:11.850]  episode 598 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast. In this episode, we're going to talk about
[00:11.850 --> 00:15.730]  setting ourselves up for success in the new year. Before we get there, let's do a few
[00:15.730 --> 00:20.130]  shout outs to a few members of the 710 Club. Of course, the 710 Club are the folks who
[00:20.130 --> 00:25.690]  support us on Patreon at the $7.10 a month level or higher. So with no further ado, let's
[00:25.690 --> 00:29.570]  start with the big Grow From Your Heart Podcast shout out to the captain and commander of
[00:29.570 --> 00:33.930]  the Haeri Army. Let's send a big thank you to my good friend, Lemur Priest. Let's follow
[00:33.930 --> 00:37.610]  that up with a big thank you shout out to my buddy Dave's Not Here. I've got a big shout
[00:37.610 --> 00:41.210]  out for my buddy Smoke What? Let's follow that one up with a big thank you shout out
[00:41.210 --> 00:45.690]  to my buddy AllMixedUp. Let's send a big thank you shout out to Fish Ganja Guy. I want to
[00:45.690 --> 00:49.770]  say thank you to Owen. Let's send a big thank you to Jethro. I've got a big Grow From Your

[01:17.690 --> 01:21.770]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who supports the podcast on Patreon. If you're
[01:21.770 --> 01:25.210]  not already supporting the show and you'd like to learn how to do so, all you have to
[01:25.210 --> 01:31.530]  do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart. All of the information
[01:31.530 --> 01:35.170]  you need to support the show will be right there on the screen. And of course I did include
[01:35.170 --> 01:39.890]  a link in the show notes and in the video description to make it super easy for all
[01:39.890 --> 01:44.890]  of my friends. Alright, Happy New Year you guys welcome to the New Year's episode. This
[01:44.890 --> 01:51.250]  is the last episode of 2020. I'm excited to put 2020 behind us. I do have a couple of
[01:51.250 --> 01:55.770]  things to cover before we get into the setting ourselves up for success part of the show.
[01:55.770 --> 02:00.430]  The first order of business is I owe a big thank you to my buddy Dirtman Dan. A couple
[02:00.430 --> 02:04.570]  of episodes ago, I was talking about the great Christmas gifts I got. I said somebody sent
[02:04.570 --> 02:08.610]  me some drumsticks. They were engraved. They say the Grow From Your Heart Podcast to take
[02:08.610 --> 02:12.810]  a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me. I didn't know where they came from. Well,
[02:12.810 --> 02:17.210]  surprise, surprise, those came from our buddy Dirtman Dan. So big shout out to Dan. Thank
[02:17.210 --> 02:21.170]  you bro. I said on the show that's a beautiful gift. Very perfect. Some of my favorite stuff
[02:21.170 --> 02:25.610]  is playing the drums and talking about the podcast and the podcast. So beautiful gift.
[02:25.610 --> 02:29.290]  Big shout out to my friend Dirtman Dan. Those sticks are sitting right up above me for this
[02:29.290 --> 02:33.610]  episode. I've got them up there up on the artwork. I felt that was an appropriate spot.
[02:33.610 --> 02:38.010]  Thank you, bro. I love the gift. The next order of business is what did you think of
[02:38.010 --> 02:42.450]  that camera setting in the last episode? I got a lot of a lot of feedback. A lot of people
[02:42.450 --> 02:47.490]  love the lighter muted colors. A lot of people hated that dark color. It came out differently
[02:47.490 --> 02:51.650]  than what I thought I had done. My goal was to kind of take some of the red out because
[02:51.650 --> 02:55.130]  of that red shirt that I was wearing made me made the video really red. I was trying
[02:55.130 --> 02:58.850]  to color correct that. I made it a little bit light trying to soften it up. I thought
[02:58.850 --> 03:02.830]  it may be more appealing for the eye instead of being super bright. Then I realized after
[03:02.830 --> 03:09.310]  I published it that my new monitor and reality are not set accurately. My monitor made everything
[03:09.310 --> 03:13.530]  look brighter than it actually was. When I watched it on another screen on YouTube, it
[03:13.530 --> 03:18.570]  looked really dark. So I do need to recalibrate my monitor, change a few settings there. I'll
[03:18.570 --> 03:22.570]  get it up to speed. Thank you for all of the feedback. If you hated it, I'm sorry. I can't
[03:22.570 --> 03:26.790]  change it now. If you loved it, you're welcome. I can't change it now. I will do my best to
[03:26.790 --> 03:30.310]  make the video look good in the future. I keep saying it you guys, I'm learning a lot
[03:30.310 --> 03:34.290]  of new equipment. As long as the content of the show is good. That's what I mainly focused
[03:34.290 --> 03:38.570]  on trying to make sure the video and the audio are top notch as well. Still learning all
[03:38.570 --> 03:43.450]  this audio gear. I'm learning a final cut pro. I'm learning a new computer monitor.
[03:43.450 --> 03:47.330]  Obviously it's a lot to work with, but thank you for the feedback and excuse me if you
[03:47.330 --> 03:51.610]  didn't like it. I kind of apologize. Also it's free and you're still able to listen
[03:51.610 --> 03:56.290]  and learn. So hope you loved it. Anyway, it is now 2021. By the time you listen to this,
[03:56.290 --> 04:02.490]  there are only a few hours left in 2020. I'm excited to close the door on this year. Flip
[04:02.490 --> 04:09.330]  the page on the calendar. Start fresh. Let's put 2020 behind us and look forward to 2021.
[04:09.330 --> 04:14.170]  But let's also keep in mind that things aren't going back to normal. This is the new world.
[04:14.170 --> 04:17.150]  It's going to be a while before things go back to normal. It's going to be a while before
[04:17.150 --> 04:21.450]  we get to hang out and congregate, join up in groups and smoke down and have a good time
[04:21.450 --> 04:25.850]  like that. So let's adjust. Let's take good care of ourselves in this weird time. Take
[04:25.850 --> 04:29.250]  care of your physical health, your mental health, take care of those around you. Hang
[04:29.250 --> 04:32.930]  out on Zoom with some people if that's what you got to do. Just take good care of yourself
[04:32.930 --> 04:37.250]  and try to adjust to this. Let your mental health stay strong. Keep your spirit strong.
[04:37.250 --> 04:41.450]  Man, I really miss events. I was thinking about it. This is the time that I should be
[04:41.450 --> 04:46.050]  preparing for the Indo Expo. Normally Indo Expo would be three weeks, maybe four weeks
[04:46.050 --> 04:51.130]  away and I am kind of feeling it. I'm trying to stay positive. Indo Expo is where I get
[04:51.130 --> 04:56.350]  to see half of the cannabis community. Everybody from the world flies to Denver. That's basically
[04:56.350 --> 05:00.110]  my backyard. It's a short drive. Get a nice hotel up there. I'm just a couple of minutes
[05:00.110 --> 05:03.870]  from the event. Get to go see everybody on the planet from the cannabis industry and
[05:03.870 --> 05:07.670]  I'm getting, we're all getting skipped on that this year. It's not just me. I'm sure
[05:07.670 --> 05:12.110]  we're all feeling it. Everybody with the company and the industry, we're all losing out, not
[05:12.110 --> 05:15.590]  just on the business. The business will make up for that. Whatever. The economy will do
[05:15.590 --> 05:19.170]  its thing. Money is money. But I miss all the people, all the interactions. I would
[05:19.170 --> 05:23.390]  take so many photos, give so many hugs, hang out with so many people and I don't get to
[05:23.390 --> 05:27.410]  do it. So I miss that event. I'm trying to stay positive, keep my head up. You guys do
[05:27.410 --> 05:31.150]  the same. I hope this show helps you stay positive and help you keep your head up. Shout
[05:31.150 --> 05:35.950]  out to Fumidor and the Flavors and everybody that was on Fumidor's, I forget the name of
[05:35.950 --> 05:39.430]  your show brother right now. I'm on the spot and I didn't write it down. He always changes
[05:39.430 --> 05:42.670]  it too. Fumidor's changed the name of his show a couple times. Anyway, I was hanging
[05:42.670 --> 05:47.390]  out with Fumidor on his YouTube channel earlier today. Really helps me keep my spirits up
[05:47.390 --> 05:51.430]  by going on there and just chatting with a few of my smoky friends, my grower friends,
[05:51.430 --> 05:55.750]  my cannabis community friends. Just staying in touch with everybody keeps my spirits high.
[05:55.750 --> 06:00.510]  I am rambling. Let's move forward with this podcast. You guys, my point is happy new year.
[06:00.510 --> 06:05.190]  Stay positive. 2020 is over, but it's not going to get back to normal for a little bit.
[06:05.190 --> 06:10.070]  Keep your head up. Let's set ourselves up for success in 2021. How are we going to do
[06:10.070 --> 06:14.310]  that? A good way to set yourself up for success is by setting goals. It's the start of the
[06:14.310 --> 06:18.590]  year. Let's set some goals and have some resolutions. I will tell you straight up that one of my
[06:18.750 --> 06:24.190]  New Year's resolutions is to get better at replying to emails. I know I suck at answering
[06:24.190 --> 06:30.190]  emails. I used to say I get 100 emails a day. Now I get about 200, 250 emails every single
[06:30.190 --> 06:34.790]  day that are not spam. There's probably another 100 spam messages to filter through. I get
[06:34.790 --> 06:39.010]  a lot of emails, you guys. I'm trying to go through them. It's just me. I do love you
[06:39.010 --> 06:43.350]  and appreciate every single one of you, but keep in mind that there are 5,000, maybe 6,000
[06:43.350 --> 06:47.510]  people subscribed to this YouTube channel, plus the people that are emailing me from
[06:47.510 --> 06:52.150]  iRegenetics stuff, plus all the contacts I get from the website. I don't want you to
[06:52.150 --> 06:56.470]  stop. Just be patient with me. If I don't reply right away, don't think that I'm ignoring
[06:56.470 --> 07:01.190]  you or dissing you or it's something personal. I want to get to every message, but it's just
[07:01.190 --> 07:06.830]  me. In 2021, I'm going to be better at answering emails. That is one of my resolutions. Be
[07:06.830 --> 07:11.630]  better. Also, I think I have responded at this point in time. I think I have responded
[07:11.630 --> 07:16.470]  to all of the Patreon messages in my inbox. Patreon was messed up for a minute. I wasn't
[07:16.470 --> 07:20.630]  able to respond on Patreon. That has been fixed. I can now read your messages. I can
[07:20.630 --> 07:26.470]  now reply. I've printed out a bunch of great Patreon messages. If I haven't replied to
[07:26.470 --> 07:31.290]  you directly on Patreon, if you feel like I have ignored you, please resend a message
[07:31.290 --> 07:34.950]  and I will get back to you. If I haven't read your question on the show, be patient. I've
[07:34.950 --> 07:41.070]  printed a bunch of those questions and they are coming up. I've been focused on the more
[07:41.070 --> 07:46.790]  of the New Year's, the Christmas sort of stuff because everyone's possibly on vacation,
[07:46.790 --> 07:51.190]  taking a holiday, doing family things. I don't want the people that sent in Patreon questions
[07:51.190 --> 07:55.350]  to skip their episode because they're doing family stuff and missed the question or missed
[07:55.350 --> 07:59.310]  the episode where I answered their question. After the New Year, after all this chaos is
[07:59.310 --> 08:03.830]  over, I will get back to the Patreon questions. There was a method to my madness for not doing
[08:03.830 --> 08:08.270]  all the Patreon stuff lately. I think I've caught up on all the Patreon messages. I've
[08:08.270 --> 08:12.630]  printed all of the questions and those will be coming up on the show very soon. Perhaps
[08:12.630 --> 08:17.270]  the next couple of episodes will be Patreon focused. All right, where are we going from
[08:17.270 --> 08:21.470]  there? Happy New Year, you guys. I keep saying that. I'm excited for a new year. 2020 was
[08:21.470 --> 08:25.430]  a pain in the ass for a lot of people. I had a lot of ups, a lot of downs. A lot of people
[08:25.430 --> 08:29.790]  had more downs than ups. If you lost some people, if you lost loved ones or family members,
[08:29.790 --> 08:33.950]  I'm sorry. Me too. I know how that feels. I'm trying to stay positive and trying to
[08:33.950 --> 08:38.510]  keep my head up and be grateful for what I do have this year. But what are we going
[08:38.510 --> 08:44.110]  to do in 2021? We're going to try to start fresh. What is a good way to start fresh in
[08:44.110 --> 08:48.750]  a grow environment and a grow? This is a grow focus show. So let's focus on starting fresh
[08:48.750 --> 08:53.750]  in our grow rooms. No matter how big or small your grow room is, it is a good time to clean
[08:53.750 --> 08:59.130]  up. Cleanliness is next to godliness. Cleanliness will prevent so many problems in your grow.
[08:59.130 --> 09:04.290]  Get organized, get clean, set some goals, have a strategy. Now is a good time. Now is
[09:04.290 --> 09:08.970]  a good time to clean everything. The first way to set ourselves up for success is to
[09:08.970 --> 09:14.210]  clean everything. Get in that grow and polish everything. Get some cleaner, get some bleach,
[09:14.210 --> 09:18.210]  get some Fizan 20, get some gloves, get some clothes that you don't mind getting super
[09:18.210 --> 09:22.770]  dirty. And let's get in that grow space and spit shine everything in there. Let's make
[09:22.770 --> 09:26.630]  it look brand new. I want to be able to eat off of your grow room floor. I want to walk
[09:26.630 --> 09:30.790]  in there with a sandwich and drop the sandwich somewhere and feel like I messed up your grow
[09:30.790 --> 09:34.210]  room, not your grow room messed up my sandwich. I want to be able to pick up my sandwich,
[09:34.210 --> 09:37.950]  my burrito, whatever I got, and just keep eating it right off your grow room floor.
[09:37.950 --> 09:41.750]  That's how clean I want to get the grow. So let's clean everything up. Let's clean the
[09:41.750 --> 09:46.590]  walls. A lot of times we don't clean the walls frequently enough. Get some bleach, get some
[09:46.590 --> 09:51.150]  Fizan 20, get some hydrogen peroxide, whatever you choose to clean your grow with. Let's
[09:51.150 --> 09:56.430]  get some of that and let's clean the walls, clean the ceiling, mop the floors, wipe down
[09:56.430 --> 10:00.150]  all of the lights. Have you cleaned the tops of your lights lately? Have you cleaned the
[10:00.150 --> 10:04.150]  tops of your stuff that you can't see above your head? Have you cleaned that shit? Have
[10:04.150 --> 10:08.070]  you taken a rag and cleaned your ducting? The ducts that run from the carbon filter
[10:08.070 --> 10:12.190]  out of the whatever facility, get a rag and just shine the top of that shit off and see
[10:12.190 --> 10:17.350]  how much dust comes off of there. Those things are filthy. Uh, where else are we going to
[10:17.350 --> 10:22.630]  clean? Clean? Have you cleaned the LEDs? I recently cleaned my LEDs and they were filthy.
[10:22.630 --> 10:26.830]  I was embarrassed at how dirty the little, the little, it's the diode, the circle part
[10:26.830 --> 10:30.990]  is about the size of a 50 cent piece. I cleaned that bitch. It was really dirty. There were
[10:30.990 --> 10:36.550]  bugs and grime on there. Clean your LEDs. Also something people forget about a lot is
[10:36.550 --> 10:42.110]  clean your fans, not just the fan blade, not just the cage, but that cage in the back.
[10:42.110 --> 10:46.390]  Also take the fan blade off and clean it all up. Put the fan blades back on there. Make
[10:46.390 --> 10:50.190]  it brand new. Just a little bit of dirt on that shroud. A little bit of dirt on your
[10:50.190 --> 10:55.350]  fan blade will drastically reduce the amount of airflow created by that fan. You're still
[10:55.350 --> 10:59.950]  spending the electricity. The fan's not moving as much air. You're essentially ripping yourself
[10:59.950 --> 11:04.910]  off. So let's get in there and clean everything. Let's clean the walls. Let's clean the ceiling.
[11:04.910 --> 11:08.950]  A lot of people don't think about cleaning the ceiling. Clean behind all that shit that
[11:08.950 --> 11:13.870]  you haven't moved out and clean behind. Clean that. Let's spit shine everything. Make it
[11:13.870 --> 11:17.550]  look like you're like high times is coming. I'm coming. We're going to come over and do
[11:17.550 --> 11:20.590]  an inspection. Do you want us to embarrass you? We're going to take photos and publish
[11:20.590 --> 11:24.630]  it on the internet. Let's clean up our grow room like we're going to be on the internet.
[11:24.630 --> 11:29.550]  I like to clean with bleach or Fizan 20. Those are my two favorite products. Bleach is readily
[11:29.550 --> 11:34.990]  available. Some people don't want to use bleach. Fizan 20 is also a great product. Use about
[11:34.990 --> 11:39.590]  30 milliliters per gallon of water of Fizan 20. It'll make everything nice and clean.
[11:39.590 --> 11:44.050]  It makes it smell very hospital and sterile. Wear gloves, wear personal protective equipment
[11:44.050 --> 11:49.330]  when using any type of abrasive cleaners. Now's a good time. If you've got empty pots,
[11:49.330 --> 11:52.730]  if you're using plastic pots, put them in the back of the truck and take them to the
[11:52.730 --> 11:57.250]  carwash and spray them down with that carwash hose. What's to stop you from cleaning your
[11:57.250 --> 12:01.290]  pots out at the carwash if you're in a legal environment, if you're in an illegal space,
[12:01.290 --> 12:05.370]  maybe reconsider this. Maybe you don't take those pots to the carwash and bust yourself.
[12:05.370 --> 12:08.930]  If you're in a legal area, take your pots to the carwash and just spray the shit out
[12:08.930 --> 12:11.930]  of them. You can leave them in the back of the truck, spray them while they're in the
[12:11.930 --> 12:15.490]  back of the truck. If you've got a truck, that's a really easy way to do it. A lot of
[12:15.490 --> 12:20.090]  times they have that clip for your floor mats. You can put a plastic pot in that clip if
[12:20.090 --> 12:23.250]  you set it up right. Use the end. You can put two of them in there and hose the shit
[12:23.250 --> 12:27.730]  out of them. Take them down. Let them dry before you stack them up too tightly. Maybe
[12:27.730 --> 12:30.570]  put them in the back of the truck and drive around to get them to dry. You don't want
[12:30.570 --> 12:33.690]  to stack them up when they're moist. They'll smell funky when you get to them. But take
[12:33.690 --> 12:39.310]  your pots to the carwash and clean them out. If you're somebody that uses fabric pots,
[12:39.310 --> 12:43.390]  you can take those fabric pots to the laundry mat, put them in the washing machine, put
[12:43.390 --> 12:46.830]  them through the dryer there, and clean them up. Don't do it at home because your wife
[12:46.830 --> 12:50.430]  or girlfriend will kick your ass. She doesn't want to come home and find your grow pots
[12:50.430 --> 12:54.390]  in the laundry and the washing machine at home. But nothing's stopping you from taking
[12:54.390 --> 12:59.030]  them to the laundry mat. So clean your pots. That is something that people often, often
[12:59.030 --> 13:04.270]  overlook. People don't clean their pots well enough. Now is also a good time to replace
[13:04.270 --> 13:08.670]  a lot of things that we use in the grow. Now is a really good time. How long has it been?
[13:08.670 --> 13:12.430]  Do you know when the last time you replaced your bulbs are? If you're not using LEDs,
[13:12.430 --> 13:17.030]  if you're using HPS or a CMH, how long has it been since you replaced that bulb? You're
[13:17.030 --> 13:21.950]  still paying for 100% of the electricity going to that bulb. If that bulb is losing its life,
[13:21.950 --> 13:27.950]  you maybe only get it beginning 70, 60, maybe 50% of the lumens of the power of the PPFD
[13:27.950 --> 13:32.270]  coming from that bulb landing on your plants, but you're still being charged 100% of the
[13:32.270 --> 13:37.210]  electricity. Let's change out the bulbs. Let's get brand new bulbs in there. And let's write
[13:37.210 --> 13:42.570]  down on January 1st, I put new bulbs in all of these fixtures. I like to get a piece of
[13:42.570 --> 13:47.170]  duct tape or some kind of tape and write January 1st, new bulbs and stick that right on the
[13:47.170 --> 13:51.410]  outside of the door. There's never a question. When did I change the bulbs? It says on the
[13:51.410 --> 13:57.090]  door, January 1st. Also those old ballasts, a lot of you guys are using the digital or
[13:57.090 --> 14:02.290]  magnetic ballasts. Those don't last forever. Those do need to be replaced and updated.
[14:02.290 --> 14:07.530]  Is it time to replace and update your ballasts and your drivers? Also, the LED drivers will
[14:07.530 --> 14:12.370]  burn out over time. Also, your LED lights will lose efficiency over time. They last
[14:12.370 --> 14:19.370]  much longer than the HPS and the metal halide bulbs and other bulbs, but over time, your
[14:19.370 --> 14:23.810]  LEDs will lose efficiency. So let's make sure that all of our gear is up to speed. You don't
[14:23.810 --> 14:27.930]  want to pay for electricity that's coming from the line, coming through the wall, coming
[14:27.930 --> 14:32.410]  down the cord, and then not giving you 100%. You want 100% coming out because you were
[14:32.410 --> 14:37.330]  paying for it. So let's get new bulbs. Let's get new ballasts. Let's check the drivers.
[14:37.330 --> 14:41.450]  Let's update anything we can. And while we're doing this, let's make a little note, stick
[14:41.450 --> 14:47.370]  it on the door. New bulbs, new ballasts in this room, January 1st. Also, keep receipts.
[14:47.370 --> 14:51.690]  Write down how much you're spending on your grow. Keep every receipt this year for everything
[14:51.690 --> 14:56.130]  you spend on your grow. Take your electricity bill. Make a photocopy of that. Keep that
[14:56.130 --> 14:59.970]  with your receipts as well. Maybe that's a bad idea in prohibition land. I live in
[14:59.970 --> 15:04.730]  a legal area. Keep track of your stuff in a legal area if you want to. If not, maybe
[15:04.730 --> 15:08.490]  create a fake Google document with fake words in there that only you know what the code
[15:08.490 --> 15:12.170]  is, but try to keep track. Let's think about what we're spending on everything in the grow
[15:12.170 --> 15:16.010]  this year. I'll talk more about that in the future.
[15:16.010 --> 15:19.090]  So where are we going to go? Now's a good time to replace all of the filters. There
[15:19.090 --> 15:23.970]  are a lot of filters that are available in our grow spaces. I've got HIPAA filters stapled
[15:23.970 --> 15:28.730]  to the wall over some ducting. I've got an air conditioner with filters. I've got carbon
[15:28.730 --> 15:33.450]  filters. I've got a filter that runs on a pump. If I use a stir pump or a feed pump,
[15:33.450 --> 15:38.770]  there's a filter on the outside of that. Now is a good time to replace all of the filters.
[15:38.770 --> 15:43.050]  Take out the filter and your air conditioner. If it's got a filter in it, clean it. It's
[15:43.050 --> 15:47.910]  not going to take that long. If it needs replaced, replace it. Also, now may be a good time just
[15:47.910 --> 15:51.970]  to check all the filters in your home HVAC, in your heater, in your air conditioning,
[15:51.970 --> 15:55.570]  in your house. Why not? You're at it. Let's get in there and clean everything up and make
[15:55.570 --> 15:56.890]  everything more efficient.
[15:56.890 --> 16:00.970]  So check the air conditioner filter. I've got an air conditioner on wheels. It's the
[16:00.970 --> 16:04.770]  portable kind with the ducting. It's got a filter right in the back that pops right up.
[16:04.770 --> 16:08.570]  I need to take it out about once a month. I just spray it down with the sprayer from
[16:08.570 --> 16:12.610]  the sink and it comes nice and clean. Dry it off with a paper towel. Put it right back.
[16:12.610 --> 16:17.090]  It maybe takes five minutes to do the whole job. Do that. Now's the first. Now's a good
[16:17.090 --> 16:20.810]  time to do it. Write that on your chore list. If you don't have a chore list, put clean
[16:20.810 --> 16:24.010]  the air conditioner filter on the chore list.
[16:24.010 --> 16:30.410]  Does your carbon filter work? You may not notice that your crop smells stanky and skunky
[16:30.410 --> 16:34.410]  and the whole neighborhood can smell it and you can't. It may be time to replace that
[16:34.410 --> 16:39.570]  carbon filter. What are we going to do when we replace it? Right. January 1st, new carbon
[16:39.570 --> 16:43.730]  filter. Stick that shit on the door. You got new bulbs, new ballast, new carbon filter.
[16:43.730 --> 16:48.130]  You are ready to rock in there. What else are we going to replace? All of the seals
[16:48.130 --> 16:52.610]  and light covers. Do you have a baffle that's hiding light from something? Are all of your
[16:52.610 --> 16:57.050]  ducts sealed? Go around and check all that stuff. Are all of your windows caulked properly?
[16:57.050 --> 17:02.250]  Is all of the places where you think that light and air could leak that you have sealed
[17:02.250 --> 17:07.810]  up in the past, is all of that stuff still secure? Has any of your tape or caulking or
[17:07.810 --> 17:12.090]  camouflaging come undone? Sometimes you get complacent. You're too worried about watering
[17:12.090 --> 17:16.970]  every day, mixing up nutrients. Is it harvest time yet? We're checking the trichomes. We're
[17:16.970 --> 17:21.450]  fighting a nutrient deficiency. We're also worried about the new PlayStation or a girlfriend
[17:21.450 --> 17:25.130]  or whatever we're thinking about today. Have you thought about all of those seals and your
[17:25.130 --> 17:29.130]  camouflage and all the small details that you were really, really worried about when
[17:29.130 --> 17:33.090]  you set up that grow and forgot about? Did you get complacent and forget about some small
[17:33.090 --> 17:37.670]  details that could really fuck you in the end? So check all of your seals and baffles
[17:37.670 --> 17:42.610]  and light covers and camouflage, especially that carbon filter. Check on all of that stuff
[17:42.730 --> 17:47.650]  and make sure you're not getting yourself in any sort of trouble. Another very important
[17:47.650 --> 17:51.370]  thing that we can do here at the start of the year that we should do every two weeks
[17:51.370 --> 17:56.930]  to at least every month is calibrate our pH pens. No matter what kind of pH pen you're
[17:56.930 --> 18:03.850]  using, it is time to clean and calibrate that bad dog at least once a month. Get the proper
[18:03.850 --> 18:09.250]  cleaning and storage solution. Take it apart, clean it up, recalibrate it, recalibrate it
[18:09.250 --> 18:14.570]  again. I've talked about using multiple test standards. Don't just have one jar of seven
[18:14.570 --> 18:19.330]  and one jar of four, have two jars of four and two jars of seven so you can check them.
[18:19.330 --> 18:23.450]  Double check yourself. That pH pen is one of the most important pieces of gear we use
[18:23.450 --> 18:28.250]  in the grow. They think and destroy our garden if it gives us a bad reading. I've got a friend
[18:28.250 --> 18:32.450]  who was dealing with a pH pen that was messed up. He got a new pH pen and corrected it and
[18:32.450 --> 18:37.050]  he's like, bro, my garden took off. So that pH pen was killing him, embarrassing him,
[18:37.050 --> 18:40.770]  making his garden look like shit. Take care of your gear, get the appropriate gear, make
[18:40.770 --> 18:46.970]  sure it's properly calibrated. Your garden, excuse me, your garden will show the difference.
[18:46.970 --> 18:52.770]  So now's the time to calibrate your pH pen and clean up your EC meter, any other meters,
[18:52.770 --> 18:57.410]  gauges, anything you're using in the grow. Now is a good time to get in there and clean
[18:57.410 --> 19:02.290]  that shit up. Don't let it be dirty. Don't let it be funky. 2020 was funky enough. Let's
[19:02.290 --> 19:08.810]  clean up for 2021. Now is also a good time to restock all of your empty supplies. Do
[19:08.810 --> 19:13.770]  you have enough nutrients? Do you have enough pesticides? Do you have all of your first
[19:13.770 --> 19:19.510]  aid kit stuff on hand? Also, let's check the expiration dates on a lot of our bottles.
[19:19.510 --> 19:23.770]  How long has that old bottle of CalMag been sitting there? How long is that bottle of
[19:23.770 --> 19:27.490]  something you haven't used in a long time? How long has that been sitting there? These
[19:27.490 --> 19:32.210]  products do not last forever. They do expire. So go check the expiration dates on your
[19:32.210 --> 19:35.990]  bottles. If some of those nutrients have been there for more than six months, I would
[19:35.990 --> 19:40.490]  toss them. If it's been there for a year in the corner getting dusty, it is trash. Get
[19:40.490 --> 19:44.170]  rid of it. Most of that stuff doesn't sit very well. They make it, they want you to
[19:44.170 --> 19:51.730]  buy it and use it. Let's not use old funky products. Also, fire alarms and smoke alarms
[19:51.730 --> 19:56.210]  and fire extinguishers. Are your fire alarms up to date? Do you have batteries in your
[19:56.210 --> 20:00.710]  smoke detectors? If they don't beep, they're useless. They're decorations at that point.
[20:00.710 --> 20:04.590]  You hung those up with faith that if there was an emergency, they would let you know.
[20:04.590 --> 20:08.190]  If you haven't replaced the battery, you're failing yourself. Your equipment is failing
[20:08.190 --> 20:11.910]  you. A battery isn't that expensive. You could buy a pack of batteries for like, I don't
[20:11.910 --> 20:15.650]  even know what batteries cost anymore to be honest. Probably 12 bucks for a nice pack
[20:15.650 --> 20:19.550]  of batteries to fill all of the smoke detectors in your house. If you don't have a few smoke
[20:19.550 --> 20:24.270]  detectors and you've got to grow, I find it irresponsible. You can cause problems with
[20:24.270 --> 20:28.830]  the grow. Maybe electrical shit goes wrong. I don't want it to you guys, but reality is
[20:28.950 --> 20:33.710]  that electrical fires do happen. Shit goes wrong. Bulbs catch on fire. Things go wrong
[20:33.710 --> 20:38.910]  in a grow, have a smoke detector. What is the point of a smoke detector without a fire
[20:38.910 --> 20:43.190]  extinguisher? Get the appropriate size fire extinguisher for the space in which you are
[20:43.190 --> 20:46.750]  working. If you've got a big space with a lot of lights, you need more fire extinguishers.
[20:46.750 --> 20:51.790]  If you're in a small home grow, one decent size fire extinguisher should work. Hopefully.
[20:51.790 --> 20:56.470]  If not, call 911 and get the fuck out. But let's be prepared. Let's have that fire extinguisher
[20:56.870 --> 21:02.590]  in case. Also, have you ever sprayed a fire extinguisher? Maybe give it a practice. It's
[21:02.590 --> 21:06.990]  not that challenging, but when you're under pressure, everything is challenging. Like
[21:06.990 --> 21:10.390]  you don't know what to do when there's a fire in your home. You're going to shit your pants
[21:10.390 --> 21:14.630]  will be the first move. Let's make sure the second move is to know how to get that fire
[21:14.630 --> 21:19.230]  extinguisher. Get the pin out, point it at the bottom of the fire and spray and burst.
[21:19.230 --> 21:22.910]  You don't need to do the long spray. Give it a few bursts. Make sure you're hitting
[21:22.910 --> 21:26.550]  the right spot. See if you're effective, then go hard. If you need to, I'm not a fire
[21:26.550 --> 21:31.270]  extinguisher trainer. That's what I was taught. Anyway, make sure your smoke alarm and fire
[21:31.270 --> 21:35.630]  extinguishers are up to date. They've got a little gauge on them, red, yellow, and green.
[21:35.630 --> 21:39.950]  The fire extinguisher is not a Rasta. It is just telling you I need charged. I'm in the
[21:39.950 --> 21:44.510]  middle of okay, or I am fully charged. Let's go red, yellow, and green. You should be able
[21:44.510 --> 21:48.750]  to figure that out from there. Where do we go from there? I mentioned it a moment ago,
[21:48.750 --> 21:54.350]  first aid kit. I don't want you to have to use the fire extinguisher or the first aid kit,
[21:54.350 --> 21:58.350]  but if they're there and you do need it, it's going to be very advantageous. You're going to
[21:58.350 --> 22:02.910]  be glad it's there. You're going to wish you had it if you do need it. That's what I'm getting to.
[22:02.910 --> 22:07.150]  So check out your first aid kit. Do you have all the stuff that you think you may need?
[22:07.150 --> 22:11.390]  Do you have some good band-aids, small, medium, and large band-aids? Do you have a big ass band-aid
[22:11.390 --> 22:15.790]  in case something goes wrong? Do you have some gauze? Do you have some eye rinse? You should
[22:15.790 --> 22:20.990]  have a bottle of saline solution, an emergency eye wash. That should be near you at all times
[22:20.990 --> 22:26.110]  if you're working with pesticides or anything, but do you have that available? Do you have a plan
[22:26.110 --> 22:30.430]  for if you get hurt? If you get something in your eye, what are you going to do? I know that I can
[22:30.430 --> 22:34.910]  open up Siri on my phone and say, hey, call this person. I got a couple of people that Siri will
[22:34.910 --> 22:42.270]  call for me and back me up. Have some sort of a strategy. Where are we going from there? Do you
[22:42.270 --> 22:48.270]  have enough gloves and Tyvek suits? Now is a good time to restock rubber gloves and Tyvek suits.
[22:48.270 --> 22:52.910]  When I spray, I like to suit up in the Tyvek paper suits. Do you have enough of those? You
[22:52.910 --> 22:57.870]  don't want to go to do a job and realize you don't have the tools for the job. So let's prepare
[22:57.870 --> 23:02.510]  ourselves, set ourselves up for success. Let's order the items we need now. That way when it's
[23:02.510 --> 23:08.830]  time, they're sitting there on the shelf. Do you have respirator cartridges? When I spray,
[23:08.830 --> 23:14.030]  I like to use the 3M respirator with the big cartridges on it. Get the appropriate carts.
[23:14.030 --> 23:17.150]  I've got the number. I've got the package down there, so I know exactly what to order.
[23:17.870 --> 23:24.110]  Do you have a good respirator and respirator cartridges? Do you know how to properly clean
[23:24.110 --> 23:28.430]  your respirator? Learn how to clean your respirator. Learn how to put it on and take it
[23:28.430 --> 23:34.590]  off correctly. I've seen people take the respirator off and contaminate themselves while taking it off.
[23:34.590 --> 23:38.190]  So if you don't know how to put on and take off your respirator appropriately, if you don't know
[23:38.190 --> 23:44.990]  how to clean it appropriately, it's useless to you. Please learn how to put it on, take it off,
[23:44.990 --> 23:49.790]  and clean it. Imagine you just sprayed a whole room with pesticides. You've got pesticide on
[23:49.790 --> 23:54.990]  your respirator and on your hands. There's an appropriate strategy to taking that mask off.
[23:54.990 --> 23:59.550]  Please read and understand fully how to do that. That's a full other episode. I could talk about
[23:59.550 --> 24:03.870]  that for probably an hour. We're not going to do that today. But it's a good time to restock
[24:03.870 --> 24:08.270]  your gloves, your Tyvek suits, and your respirator cartridges. While you're at it,
[24:08.270 --> 24:12.910]  reorder any pesticides that you may use. If you use a bottled spray pesticide, if you used a
[24:12.910 --> 24:17.950]  powdered pesticide or fungicide, let's restock. Now is the time. Let's not run out of shit.
[24:17.950 --> 24:20.990]  When you're in panic mode, you see some mites, you go to get that pest spray,
[24:21.710 --> 24:25.470]  and you're all out of it. Now we've got to order it and wait two or three more days for it to get
[24:25.470 --> 24:30.190]  here. Your bugs are going to get out of control. Let's get that shit in stock on hand now.
[24:30.990 --> 24:36.190]  What about goggles? Do you have good goggles? A lot of those goggles get misshapen, they get
[24:36.190 --> 24:40.990]  dirty, they get fucking stomped on, they get left in weird places. Are your goggles in good shape?
[24:40.990 --> 24:45.150]  I know that sounds very super nerdy to be worried about goggles. But when we're spraying, when we're
[24:45.150 --> 24:51.870]  mixing shit, eye protection is very important. Your eyes are the most delicate organ on your
[24:51.870 --> 24:56.990]  body that are exposed to the elements and vulnerable to attack. You can get shit in
[24:56.990 --> 25:02.270]  them very easily. Also, they're one of your most used organs, your outer organs, your senses.
[25:02.270 --> 25:05.390]  What are you going to do without your eyes? You're not going to be quite the grower you were if you
[25:05.390 --> 25:10.350]  get something in your eye and go blind. So let's protect our eyes, you guys. I know I'm all about
[25:10.350 --> 25:14.590]  extra protection, but we've got to be safe in the grow. People are looking up to us. We've got to
[25:14.590 --> 25:19.550]  set a good example. So we've covered most of the things we need to buy and clean. I know I went
[25:19.550 --> 25:25.150]  quickly. We've got to clean everything. We've got to restock everything. Let's inspect everything.
[25:25.150 --> 25:30.190]  Are all of the pieces of gear, every moving part, is it working the way that it needs to? Does your
[25:30.190 --> 25:35.870]  air conditioner make a weird noise? Update all that shit. Is the dehumidifier working properly?
[25:35.870 --> 25:41.150]  Is the humidifier working properly? While I'm thinking about those, let's clean those as well.
[25:41.150 --> 25:46.190]  Clean everything. Get in there with bleach or Fizen and clean it out. Take it apart completely.
[25:46.190 --> 25:51.230]  All those, that little bottom part that you missed, I'm going to find that if I come look.
[25:51.230 --> 25:54.350]  You take it apart. You clean it before we've got to embarrass you.
[25:54.350 --> 26:01.950]  Now, here's another good thing to do for 2021. Let's start taking copious notes. Let's write
[26:01.950 --> 26:06.830]  down everything we do in the grow. Let's write down everything we purchase. Let's write down
[26:06.830 --> 26:11.790]  every adjustment to equipment we make. Let's write down everything we mix up, every pH of
[26:11.790 --> 26:17.550]  every solution we feed, every EC of every solution we feed. We should definitely be writing down
[26:17.550 --> 26:22.270]  every pesticide application, any spray applications that happen to the plants.
[26:22.270 --> 26:28.190]  Let's start taking copious notes. There are several reasons for this. If you make a mistake,
[26:28.190 --> 26:32.910]  you can look back at the notes. You can say, man, these plants started messing up around the first.
[26:32.910 --> 26:37.390]  I would say look back at the notes about two weeks ago and see what you did two weeks ago and pay
[26:37.390 --> 26:41.550]  attention. You'll see somewhere where you fucked up and you'll go, oh, right here, look. This day,
[26:41.550 --> 26:46.750]  the pH was off. That is what messed up your crop now. Take a lot of notes. If you make a mistake,
[26:46.750 --> 26:52.750]  you can look back and see what you did wrong. Or if your crop comes out perfect, if it's the best
[26:52.750 --> 26:57.550]  crop ever, you've got notes. You know exactly what you did. If we don't take any notes, it's just,
[26:57.550 --> 27:02.430]  I think I might've given it a this on this week. I might've done this. I don't remember, bro.
[27:02.990 --> 27:06.190]  Then you can't repeat the exact same results. You're going to have a different outcome. Next
[27:06.190 --> 27:09.470]  time you're going to be chasing that result and you'll never get it again because you don't know
[27:09.470 --> 27:15.630]  exactly what you did. So let's take a lot, a lot of notes in 2021. Keep a grow journal,
[27:15.630 --> 27:21.790]  keep a grow diary. And then that way we can set ourselves up for even better success in 2022.
[27:21.790 --> 27:26.510]  What planning ahead strategy? What, who would have thought that's how business works. You guys,
[27:26.510 --> 27:32.350]  that's how successful people do shit. Let's set ourselves up for success. Now let's also see what
[27:32.350 --> 27:37.470]  our grow costs and profits this year. I don't know if you're growing for yourself, for your own
[27:37.470 --> 27:41.390]  medical needs. I don't know if you're a black market grower. I don't know if you run a commercial
[27:41.390 --> 27:47.550]  grow, but let's see where are the profits and losses? How can you make that grow better next
[27:47.550 --> 27:52.110]  year? How can you make it improve financially? How can you make it make you better medicine?
[27:52.910 --> 27:58.190]  Whatever you consider a profit, whatever you consider a loss, let's write down everything,
[27:58.190 --> 28:03.070]  every penny that gets spent in that grow. If it's on a light bulb, if it's on bleach to clean the
[28:03.070 --> 28:09.630]  grow, if it's on seeds, if it's on nutrients, the electricity, the water, everything that goes into
[28:09.630 --> 28:15.790]  that grow, write it down, take a note of it. Then when you harvest, write down every consumable gram
[28:15.790 --> 28:20.750]  that you make. If you use the trim for something, write that down as well. Maybe if you've got to do
[28:20.750 --> 28:25.630]  this in a code because you're in a red state, do this in some sort of a code, but let's write this
[28:25.630 --> 28:30.590]  all down and see where we are profiting and where we are losing in our garden. That is very important.
[28:30.590 --> 28:35.950]  Now, uh, with the price of cannabis going so low in legal places and the cost of electricity and
[28:35.950 --> 28:41.070]  gear being so high and the cost of seeds and dirt and everything, it is a real good time to start
[28:41.070 --> 28:45.710]  doing a profit and loss sheet on your grow. And if you're not selling anything, you know what
[28:45.710 --> 28:50.430]  cannabis is worth. You know what each ounce is worth. See what you are paying for each ounce,
[28:50.430 --> 28:54.750]  and then consider your time and labor and effort into that as well. See what you're getting out of
[28:54.750 --> 28:59.630]  this grow. It's very important in my opinion, to know where the money's going and what we're
[28:59.630 --> 29:03.710]  getting out of it and what is cost effective and what is just falling right through the fucking
[29:03.870 --> 29:08.190]  hole. You don't want to throw money away, especially when we're all on this pandemic
[29:08.190 --> 29:11.790]  times. We don't know where money's coming from next. Everyone's waiting for a stimulus check.
[29:11.790 --> 29:15.790]  I'm not going to get political, but money is expensive. That's the bottom line. So let's
[29:15.790 --> 29:20.430]  document every penny, see where we can save a few bucks. That way we can buy a better piece
[29:20.430 --> 29:23.790]  of gear next year. Maybe we can see that this nutrient we're using isn't worth a shit.
[29:24.670 --> 29:30.110]  Readjust, re-strategize based on the data that we find. So another thing we need to do is set
[29:30.110 --> 29:37.550]  some goals for 2021. What were you not good at in 2020? Are you not a good cloner? Do you not
[29:37.550 --> 29:41.870]  answer your emails frequently enough? Whatever it is, if it's in your grow, if it's in your life,
[29:41.870 --> 29:47.630]  I'm doing a grow show. I recommend you pick a few grows, a few goals for your grow, and obviously
[29:47.630 --> 29:52.990]  pick a few goals for your life, but let's set a few goals in 2021. Do you want to be better at
[29:52.990 --> 29:58.430]  cloning? Do you want to get better at mixing your nutrients? Do you want to understand VPD better?
[29:58.430 --> 30:01.870]  Do you want to understand, do you want to just get better overall harvest? Do you want more
[30:01.870 --> 30:06.270]  turps? Do you want fatter weights? What do you want to do? Do you want to learn about breeding?
[30:06.270 --> 30:14.350]  What is your goal in 2021? Now's the time to think about that. So let's refocus and regroup because
[30:14.350 --> 30:18.830]  I know that 2020 kicked a lot of our asses. It looks like I came out on top, but trust me,
[30:18.830 --> 30:23.070]  I lost family members. Things weren't the way that they were supposed to be this year.
[30:23.070 --> 30:26.830]  I did have plans for 2020 with myself and with this company and with my family.
[30:27.390 --> 30:32.910]  All of that shit got kind of rearranged and pushed aside, but I'm readjusting. I'm re-strategizing.
[30:32.910 --> 30:37.870]  I'm refocusing. I'm keeping my mental health strong. My spirit is strong. My physical health
[30:37.870 --> 30:41.470]  seems to be strong. That shit sneaks up on you, I guess, but I feel like I'm doing well.
[30:41.470 --> 30:47.390]  So it is time to refocus and regroup and reset our goals for 2021, adjust and realize things are
[30:47.390 --> 30:51.550]  not going to be the way that they were. If you're looking for things to go back to normal, you may
[30:51.550 --> 30:57.950]  not be setting yourself up for success. Now we've got to adjust and adapt. 2021 through 2022 will be
[30:57.950 --> 31:02.590]  different. The world's not going to go right back to the way it was. Even if this pandemic, this
[31:02.590 --> 31:06.990]  virus, if it just goes away, it's still going to take a little while for us to readjust and readapt.
[31:06.990 --> 31:11.790]  So set yourself up, set some goals, have some plans. Most of all, take good care of yourself.
[31:11.790 --> 31:15.950]  Take good care of the people around you. Don't forget, just smile and have a good fucking time.
[31:15.950 --> 31:21.150]  No matter how stressful life can get, no matter how worried you are, have a good time because no
[31:21.710 --> 31:25.710]  one's going to make it out alive. Nobody will make it out alive. So enjoy it while you're here,
