[00:01.020 --> 00:21.950]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community. It's time for episode number 158 of the Grow From
[00:21.950 --> 00:26.270]  Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's
[00:26.270 --> 00:30.390]  right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker
[00:30.390 --> 00:34.850]  or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious
[00:34.850 --> 00:39.870]  about the current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you. I'm your
[00:39.870 --> 00:43.670]  host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me. As
[00:43.670 --> 00:47.150]  always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:47.150 --> 00:52.110]  for letting me use their music on my podcast. Big thanks to Kat, Koot, and the entire Mystic
[00:52.110 --> 00:57.390]  Roots crew. Ladies and gentlemen, across the table from me once again is our buddy, White
[00:57.390 --> 00:58.390]  Mike. How are you doing today, bro?
[00:58.390 --> 00:59.390]  Doing good, man. How are you?
[00:59.390 --> 01:02.870]  I'm good, bro. I'm glad you recovered from that dab. You're not quite so purple anymore.
[01:02.870 --> 01:05.910]  Yeah, I caught my breath. Doing good.
[01:05.910 --> 01:12.910]  Nice. Shout out to our friends at TR Concentrate, smoking on some StarDog Shatter. What's the
[01:12.910 --> 01:15.230]  dab that you just gave me a dab of? The Candy Kush?
[01:15.230 --> 01:17.230]  The Botanico's Live Resin Candy Kush.
[01:17.230 --> 01:19.870]  You know, that was pretty tasty. Shout out to those guys as well.
[01:19.870 --> 01:23.150]  Absolutely delicious. Botanico does a hell of a job.
[01:23.150 --> 01:27.750]  I'm about 200 milligrams deep on some edibles right now. We've been taking plenty of dabs.
[01:27.750 --> 01:31.950]  We are going to bring you an amazing podcast. I promise you. In this episode, we're going
[01:31.950 --> 01:35.830]  to talk about an email that I was sent. A friend of ours in, I think he's in Michigan.
[01:35.830 --> 01:37.150]  We'll verify that in the email.
[01:37.150 --> 01:38.150]  In Michigan.
[01:38.150 --> 01:44.710]  He is awaiting and anticipating the legalization of cannabis in his area. He wants to be properly
[01:44.710 --> 01:49.230]  prepared and he wants to know how to get a jump on things, basically. Then he also, he's
[01:49.230 --> 01:53.510]  got a legislation question lined up for Mike. Then he's got a grow question lined up for
[01:53.510 --> 01:57.990]  me. That'll probably take up most of the episode. I'm also going to read a Facebook post from
[01:57.990 --> 02:03.550]  somebody in the cannabis community. I also hope to get to an email. We'll start with
[02:03.550 --> 02:06.750]  that one because it'll be quick. I hope to get to an email, a message that we received
[02:06.750 --> 02:12.030]  from Instagram. We'll probably start with that. Before we get that far, hey Mike, let
[02:12.030 --> 02:16.190]  everybody on that's listening, let everybody know how they can stalk you on social media
[02:16.190 --> 02:18.790]  so that they can check you out while they're listening to your handsome voice.
[02:18.790 --> 02:25.950]  You can find me on Twitter at Nemopunk15 or on Facebook, Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis
[02:25.950 --> 02:26.950]  Laws.
[02:26.950 --> 02:29.870]  Make sure you support Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws on Facebook. You guys, he posts
[02:29.870 --> 02:31.150]  a lot of great stuff there.
[02:31.150 --> 02:35.190]  Give us a like. If you see something you like, give us a share. We'd appreciate it.
[02:35.190 --> 02:38.670]  Help us build the cannabis army. All right, dude, thanks for coming.
[02:38.670 --> 02:45.390]  Yeah, man. I got a prompt when you said you had an email that specifically requested you
[02:45.390 --> 02:49.190]  and me to answer some stuff. This is going to be an awesome question for anybody who
[02:49.190 --> 02:51.870]  states moving forward with their marijuana laws.
[02:51.870 --> 02:55.150]  They called you white Mike specifically. So I knew I needed you for this.
[02:55.150 --> 02:59.110]  Yep. No, it's a good question. You guys, you're going to want to listen to this, especially
[02:59.110 --> 03:04.030]  if you're in Michigan, but also if your state's just looking to go medical or even recreational.
[03:04.030 --> 03:08.750]  Yes. Everywhere that is getting ready or has not yet. This could be informative for
[03:08.750 --> 03:09.750]  you.
[03:09.750 --> 03:12.350]  There's a lot of listeners I'm betting that could use the information we're about to cover
[03:12.350 --> 03:13.350]  today.
[03:13.350 --> 03:15.750]  Yeah. All right. Before we get there, I want to talk about the breeding project that I
[03:15.750 --> 03:20.430]  keep telling everybody about. I am making, I've got an Arise mail. If you haven't been
[03:20.430 --> 03:25.710]  updated yet, if you don't listen to the show regularly, I am breeding. I am, I'm I region X.
[03:25.710 --> 03:27.110]  He's breeding cannabis plants.
[03:27.110 --> 03:28.110]  Yeah. So I'm breeding cannabis plants. Sorry.
[03:28.110 --> 03:29.110]  We should be specific here.
[03:29.110 --> 03:30.750]  They're not, they're not goats or children.
[03:30.750 --> 03:32.870]  If you haven't been listening, let's catch you all the way up.
[03:32.870 --> 03:37.750]  I'm not breeding piranha. I'm breeding cannabis plants. I made the Arise. Arise is a strain
[03:37.750 --> 03:45.110]  that I made. It recently tested at 31% THC. It is a cross of golden goat and a daybreaker.
[03:45.110 --> 03:50.550]  It is a regular seed. It is not feminized. It is tested at 31% THC. I searched through
[03:50.550 --> 03:54.950]  about a hundred seeds, maybe more than a hundred to find the male plant that I want. I've got
[03:54.950 --> 04:02.750]  a really killer male. I have also got a few phenotypes of females of the same strain. Those
[04:02.830 --> 04:07.110]  are all in a room together. The male has been removed. He's his pollen did its thing. The
[04:07.110 --> 04:10.630]  male has been pulled out of there. There's also a lemon skunk plant in there. There's
[04:10.630 --> 04:16.190]  a golden goat plant in there for experimental reasons. And there's also a grateful dog plant
[04:16.190 --> 04:19.630]  in there because I wanted to make the Arise cross to grateful dog. Cause those are my
[04:19.630 --> 04:22.150]  two flagship that I'm known for right now.
[04:22.150 --> 04:23.150]  Two of my favorite.
[04:23.150 --> 04:26.190]  Yeah. So two of a lot of people's favorites. So I put them together. We'll see what happens
[04:26.190 --> 04:30.670]  to that. There will not be any retail grateful dog to Arise seeds for a long time. I made
[04:30.670 --> 04:31.670]  a very small batch.
[04:31.670 --> 04:33.990]  This is the beginning of the project folks.
[04:33.990 --> 04:39.150]  Yes. The Arise however, I just made F2. The Arise male hit the Arise females and I made
[04:39.150 --> 04:46.110]  F2 and by hitting multiple phenotypes of the females, I have made a nice option for selection
[04:46.110 --> 04:51.230]  for variation for my F3s. I'll get to see what that plant, what that, what that plant
[04:51.230 --> 04:55.590]  expresses in a lot of different ways. So I'll be able to pick a very good male and a very
[04:55.590 --> 05:00.870]  good female to make the F3. I'm actually, my goal is to take this to F5 and I'm trying
[05:00.870 --> 05:03.590]  not to rush it. I want to go through and find the exact plants I need.
[05:03.590 --> 05:07.990]  The more time and the more plants is sort of the better is the rule of thumb in these
[05:07.990 --> 05:13.610]  projects. You know, my encouragement is to go slow and as big as possible.
[05:13.610 --> 05:19.910]  Selection is key when it comes to this. So I believe that if I hit multiple females with
[05:19.910 --> 05:23.990]  one male and then I pull seeds from, and I keep them separate and then I find that golden
[05:23.990 --> 05:28.750]  male I don't have to use, say I've got the females are labeled actually what they actually
[05:28.750 --> 05:33.350]  are is there's number four. Okay. The keepers, the ones that are going to survive to another
[05:33.350 --> 05:38.070]  run are four, eight, and one that was lettered E from a previous run. Those are the three
[05:38.070 --> 05:41.030]  that are amazing phenotypes of a rise. They will.
[05:41.030 --> 05:42.310]  Okay. So those are your ladies?
[05:42.310 --> 05:47.230]  Yeah. Those will stick around for a while. Those, that's the I3, the I-R-E-3. Those will
[05:47.230 --> 05:50.270]  stick around for a little bit. The male I call him Solomon. It's a rise. He's a male.
[05:50.270 --> 05:58.630]  His name is Solomon. I feel that I'll show, I'll see diversity and I may pick a male from
[05:59.150 --> 06:05.230]  number three or E and then I may pick a female from number four and I may breed that way,
[06:05.230 --> 06:08.630]  which that's still the same finial generation and it's still the same genetics. So I'm still
[06:08.630 --> 06:13.750]  making F3s, but it gives me a little, it'll show a lot of variation and a lot of phenotypical
[06:13.750 --> 06:14.750]  expressions.
[06:14.750 --> 06:15.750]  In the next run you're going to have a lot more options than you would have otherwise
[06:15.750 --> 06:17.590]  because you're going as big as you are right now.
[06:17.590 --> 06:21.830]  And I'm trying to narrow it down to where it almost looks like clones when you grow
[06:21.830 --> 06:25.270]  these seeds. By the time I get to F5, I want to be able to say, yeah, it's going to look
[06:25.430 --> 06:30.550]  like this and it's basically a clone. That's my goal. So that's where I'm taking that.
[06:30.550 --> 06:31.550]  They are-
[06:31.550 --> 06:36.550]  So listeners, if you're not quite as nerdy as we are, what the long and the short of
[06:36.550 --> 06:39.870]  what we're getting at here, the goal of all of this is to find the best of the best of
[06:39.870 --> 06:40.870]  the best.
[06:40.870 --> 06:41.870]  Yes.
[06:41.870 --> 06:46.870]  And basically what that takes is a lot of trial and error and a lot of willingness to
[06:46.870 --> 06:55.390]  kill off plants. And towards the end or at the end, the goal is you'll be able to put
[06:55.390 --> 07:00.950]  a 10 pack of seeds in the ground and have all of them come up very, very, very similar,
[07:00.950 --> 07:06.870]  very stable. And that's what you're looking for, for a market ready product. And that's
[07:06.870 --> 07:10.030]  not often what you get when you're buying seeds.
[07:10.030 --> 07:11.030]  A lot of what's available-
[07:11.030 --> 07:12.030]  Would you say that was fair?
[07:12.030 --> 07:16.270]  I'll say that that's fair. A lot of what is available and even a lot of what I am making
[07:16.270 --> 07:22.550]  and what is available for myself are F1s, which means that they have not been F2, which
[07:22.550 --> 07:23.550]  means they have not been stabilized.
[07:23.550 --> 07:24.550]  They haven't even gone this far.
[07:24.550 --> 07:28.630]  Yeah. I took a male of one strain and a female of another, and I put pollen on it and it
[07:28.630 --> 07:32.390]  made seeds. And I tested them plenty before they were released. There are a lot of seed
[07:32.390 --> 07:36.630]  companies that do that, but that's what a lot of my stuff is. But guys like DJ Short-
[07:36.630 --> 07:38.710]  That's the market standard right there, basically.
[07:38.710 --> 07:42.070]  That's kind of, yeah. That's how Gage Green Genetics does it. That's sort of how Subcool
[07:42.070 --> 07:43.070]  does it.
[07:43.070 --> 07:47.910]  I've actually made a 10-pack that's one of each strain and it's like, oi.
[07:47.910 --> 07:50.110]  Oh, like how Greenhouse will sell you-
[07:50.110 --> 07:54.150]  Well, I've seen it from a number of the major companies where you'll get it in one form
[07:54.150 --> 07:56.910]  or another. I've seen it as 10 little plastic baggies stapled together.
[07:56.910 --> 08:01.110]  Right. Here's one OG Kush. Here's one Sauer Diesel. Here's one Northern Lights. Yeah.
[08:01.110 --> 08:03.390]  And you're like, I get one seed of that?
[08:03.390 --> 08:09.630]  I mean, just trial and error with germination alone makes that silly. But when you know
[08:09.630 --> 08:15.710]  as much as we do about phenotypical expression and plant stabilization and that this is likely
[08:15.710 --> 08:20.510]  an F1 or maybe if I'm lucky an F2, God only knows what I'm getting.
[08:20.510 --> 08:22.390]  If I've only got one seed, I'll make shit work.
[08:22.390 --> 08:24.630]  Well, I will not. I've seen people bank on it.
[08:24.630 --> 08:26.430]  My lemon skunk that I have-
[08:26.430 --> 08:31.950]  My lemon skunk that I have came as a gift seed from somebody else and I got one of them.
[08:31.950 --> 08:35.950]  And it was a gift from somebody else and they got it from Greenhouse Seeds and they got
[08:35.950 --> 08:36.950]  one.
[08:36.950 --> 08:39.510]  I've grown a few killer one-offs in my day as well.
[08:39.590 --> 08:45.670]  And that one that I kept, that I have, is what I have bred the Lemon Jeffrey and Cascade from.
[08:45.670 --> 08:50.630]  One of your first big breeding projects had a plant, I can never remember if it was the
[08:50.630 --> 08:54.510]  bubblegum or the grapefruit, some of the best stuff I've smoked to this day.
[08:54.510 --> 08:57.110]  And it was just the one-off that we couldn't find again.
[08:57.110 --> 09:00.750]  Right. Yeah. Sometimes if I don't like the way stuff grows or whatever, I just don't-
[09:00.750 --> 09:05.190]  I remember it grew atrociously, but the flavor of it was just, oh, it was so up my alley.
[09:05.190 --> 09:06.190]  Oh, it was the grapefruit?
[09:06.190 --> 09:07.190]  Yeah.
[09:07.190 --> 09:08.190]  I don't remember that one.
[09:08.190 --> 09:09.750]  I didn't like the way it did its thing.
[09:09.750 --> 09:10.750]  Yep.
[09:10.750 --> 09:13.910]  If I don't like the way a plant grows, I'll just get rid of it because like we were saying,
[09:13.910 --> 09:14.910]  I've got so many seeds.
[09:14.910 --> 09:19.070]  Why not just run more seeds to replace that and have the best of the best?
[09:19.070 --> 09:21.910]  You don't want something that does- if you can find a 10, you don't want a bunch of sevens
[09:21.910 --> 09:22.910]  around.
[09:22.910 --> 09:23.910]  Very, very true.
[09:23.910 --> 09:24.910]  Yeah.
[09:24.910 --> 09:25.910]  All right.
[09:25.910 --> 09:30.790]  So the breeding project I am speaking of is approximately 62-ish days.
[09:30.790 --> 09:34.270]  Tomorrow will be the start of week 10.
[09:34.270 --> 09:35.350]  So it's 63 days.
[09:35.350 --> 09:38.710]  It's nine weeks in, which means it's just about done.
[09:38.710 --> 09:40.870]  I've been taking out one- I've taken out three.
[09:40.870 --> 09:42.590]  I've taken out four seeds now.
[09:42.590 --> 09:44.790]  The fourth seed looked completely ready.
[09:44.790 --> 09:46.230]  So I'm letting it ripen up.
[09:46.230 --> 09:48.750]  And then tomorrow is Monday.
[09:48.750 --> 09:52.630]  Hopefully if I get all of my work done at a reasonable hour by the end of Monday, I
[09:52.630 --> 09:58.790]  may go in there and start chopping down plants of the new Arise F2 project.
[09:58.790 --> 09:59.790]  I'm loving it.
[09:59.790 --> 10:01.070]  I'm excited for it.
[10:01.070 --> 10:02.070]  It's just a small run.
[10:02.070 --> 10:03.070]  It won't take me a lot of trimming.
[10:03.070 --> 10:07.190]  The way I'll do it is I'm going to cut down one plant and then-
[10:07.190 --> 10:10.190]  These are the ones I saw a week ago, a few days ago.
[10:10.190 --> 10:11.190]  Yeah.
[10:11.190 --> 10:12.190]  Yeah.
[10:12.190 --> 10:13.190]  The little tiny- they're pretty small plants.
[10:13.190 --> 10:14.190]  Yep.
[10:14.190 --> 10:17.590]  So I'll cut them down, take off all the big leaves, hang them upside down, let them dry
[10:17.590 --> 10:23.230]  until they're fairly crispy basically, and then just cut off a branch, hold it over either
[10:23.230 --> 10:25.990]  a Tupperware dish or a pie plate and crumble it up just like a-
[10:25.990 --> 10:28.350]  You want it pretty crispy when you're harvesting seed.
[10:28.350 --> 10:29.350]  Yeah.
[10:29.350 --> 10:32.610]  Just like you're going to roll up old school weed and just crunch it up and let the seeds
[10:32.610 --> 10:35.750]  fall out and then pull out the seeds, pull out the material.
[10:35.750 --> 10:39.130]  We may roll some joints with the dried material, but then a lot of it's going to get turned
[10:39.130 --> 10:40.130]  into concentrates.
[10:40.130 --> 10:43.650]  We'll have some VHO coming up here in just a little while, but then I'll set the seeds
[10:43.650 --> 10:46.530]  aside, let them dry out real well, get them nice and hard.
[10:46.530 --> 10:48.330]  And then I will put them into little packages.
[10:48.330 --> 10:53.290]  I need to get some packages from lecontainers.com and then get those lined up, get a few of
[10:53.290 --> 10:56.090]  them into some packages and get them out to my friends that test them out for me.
[10:56.090 --> 11:01.090]  And then I will grow a shit ton of them myself and I will see if the Arise F2s are worth
[11:01.290 --> 11:06.170]  growing, worth making more of, or if I selected the wrong male, then I'll go back and find
[11:06.170 --> 11:08.450]  another boy of that shit and try again.
[11:08.450 --> 11:12.290]  But since I've used multiple females, I'll keep all the females separate, keep the seeds
[11:12.290 --> 11:17.770]  separated and I will run comparisons of batch A, batch B, batch C, and I will see which
[11:17.770 --> 11:20.410]  ones I like better so that I could find my breeders.
[11:20.410 --> 11:24.050]  I'm going to do a lot of research and a lot of work and a lot of looking before I even
[11:24.050 --> 11:26.810]  continue, before I even think about making an F2.
[11:26.810 --> 11:30.610]  I want to really see what the F- or before I make an F3, I want to see what the F2s really,
[11:30.610 --> 11:31.610]  really do.
[11:31.610 --> 11:34.610]  So it's almost time to take those down probably tomorrow night when I get done doing all my
[11:34.610 --> 11:35.610]  work.
[11:35.610 --> 11:38.290]  Then I'll let you guys know how they grow.
[11:38.290 --> 11:39.570]  You know, I'll talk about that on the show.
[11:39.570 --> 11:42.610]  So anyone that's been looking forward to it, me too, me too.
[11:42.610 --> 11:43.650]  I'm really excited about this.
[11:43.650 --> 11:45.970]  If you can't tell, I've been talking about it for a long time.
[11:45.970 --> 11:50.730]  So I want to talk about one more thing before we get into some of the main topics.
[11:50.730 --> 11:55.070]  A couple of, so let me go way far back.
[11:55.070 --> 11:59.290]  About a year and a half ago, we're coming up on two years almost, a year and three quarters
[11:59.290 --> 12:00.290]  ago.
[12:00.970 --> 12:01.970]  I hit my head.
[12:01.970 --> 12:02.970]  I hit the fuck out of my head.
[12:02.970 --> 12:05.890]  Long story short, I hit my head on a low doorway.
[12:05.890 --> 12:09.130]  I'm 6'5", the doorway was probably 6'3".
[12:09.130 --> 12:13.130]  I was walking fast enough to where when I hit the top of my head on this doorway, it
[12:13.130 --> 12:15.050]  knocked me clean the fuck out.
[12:15.050 --> 12:16.530]  I was walking to some stairs.
[12:16.530 --> 12:19.290]  I hit my head, knocked myself out, completely unconscious.
[12:19.290 --> 12:22.570]  I went spaghetti and fell down the stairs while I was completely unconscious.
[12:22.570 --> 12:26.970]  I had to have a couple of friends wake me up, carry me up the stairs, get me in a chair,
[12:26.970 --> 12:28.010]  try to get my shit back together.
[12:28.010 --> 12:29.650]  I was broken, you guys.
[12:30.010 --> 12:31.010]  I had a traumatic brain injury.
[12:31.010 --> 12:32.250]  I had some serious problems.
[12:32.250 --> 12:33.370]  My vision was not right.
[12:33.370 --> 12:34.370]  My brain was not right.
[12:34.370 --> 12:38.250]  My word association wasn't happening properly.
[12:38.250 --> 12:40.330]  My names, I couldn't remember people's names.
[12:40.330 --> 12:42.890]  My best friends would be sitting at the table and I couldn't tell you what the fuck their
[12:42.890 --> 12:44.050]  names were.
[12:44.050 --> 12:45.050]  I was broken.
[12:45.050 --> 12:46.050]  I was having problems.
[12:46.050 --> 12:48.970]  I was having physical problems related to it.
[12:48.970 --> 12:51.170]  My body would not regulate its temperature.
[12:51.170 --> 12:55.530]  It was wintertime and I was running around in just a t-shirt and everyone's in coats
[12:55.530 --> 12:57.570]  and shit and they're looking at me like, dude, what kind of drugs are you on?
[12:57.570 --> 12:58.570]  I was like, head injury.
[12:58.570 --> 12:59.570]  No drugs.
[12:59.570 --> 13:01.170]  I was sweating all the time now.
[13:01.170 --> 13:04.250]  Like it would not stop being overheated.
[13:04.250 --> 13:06.130]  But something that was also funky was my vision.
[13:06.130 --> 13:08.010]  My vision would get wobbly sometimes.
[13:08.010 --> 13:12.010]  Like if I would watch certain like animated shit or certain TV shows filmed a certain
[13:12.010 --> 13:15.170]  way, my vision would get weird and I just have to quit watching it.
[13:15.170 --> 13:17.890]  Certain video games would fuck with my head if I was, I don't really play video games,
[13:17.890 --> 13:22.890]  but if I watch other people play some games would mess with my head.
[13:22.890 --> 13:24.170]  Nothing's really messed with me for a little while.
[13:24.170 --> 13:27.650]  I was having dizzy spells a little while for a little while, but everything's pretty much
[13:27.650 --> 13:28.650]  back to normal.
[13:28.730 --> 13:33.770]  I think I'm back on track from all that until I recorded that episode at Elevate a couple
[13:33.770 --> 13:34.770]  of weeks ago.
[13:34.770 --> 13:37.370]  If you guys listen to the podcast, I went to Elevate and recorded a show.
[13:37.370 --> 13:39.570]  There's a rig there by an artist named Matt Cameron.
[13:39.570 --> 13:40.570]  No, it's not a man.
[13:40.570 --> 13:41.570]  Why do I call him Matt Cameron?
[13:41.570 --> 13:44.170]  I saw the social media post about this now I know where you're going.
[13:44.170 --> 13:45.170]  Yeah.
[13:45.170 --> 13:46.170]  His name's Cameron Reed.
[13:46.170 --> 13:47.170]  Let me correct myself.
[13:47.170 --> 13:49.170]  I think Matt Cameron is a drummer that I watched a video from the other day, but the dude's
[13:49.170 --> 13:52.330]  name is Cameron Reed, Cameron Reed Glass on Instagram.
[13:52.330 --> 13:56.610]  This dude made a rig and the work is called Redichello or ready work is what they call
[13:56.610 --> 13:57.610]  it.
[13:57.610 --> 14:00.650]  It's a clear glass with white lines through it and it's fucking beautiful.
[14:00.650 --> 14:03.890]  So I saw this rig and when I stared at the rig, it started moving.
[14:03.890 --> 14:08.530]  It had kind of a Christmas ornament glass kind of quality to it.
[14:08.530 --> 14:12.770]  If, if that helps describe it for the listeners, it's trippy to my brain, dude.
[14:12.770 --> 14:14.650]  It makes my brain do weird shit.
[14:14.650 --> 14:16.610]  When I look at it, it looks like it's moving.
[14:16.610 --> 14:19.430]  All of those lines look like they're spinning around like Tron.
[14:19.430 --> 14:21.330]  It's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[14:21.330 --> 14:24.650]  And when I started it, everybody kind of looked at me like I was crazy.
[14:24.650 --> 14:26.130]  And I was like, oh, you got to quit looking at that.
[14:26.130 --> 14:28.450]  Like, cause you're the only one seeing that dude, you got to stop.
[14:28.450 --> 14:31.050]  And I was like, okay, I'm going to walk away from this.
[14:31.050 --> 14:34.210]  But then I posted on Facebook, basically my experience is like, I fell in love with this
[14:34.210 --> 14:35.210]  rig.
[14:35.210 --> 14:39.170]  Unfortunately, you guys, this rig is a, I looked at the price tag from underneath cause
[14:39.170 --> 14:42.010]  the price tags on the bottom and the, the shelf it's sitting on is glass.
[14:42.010 --> 14:43.350]  So I could see through it.
[14:43.350 --> 14:46.250]  It's either 2,100 or $2,400.
[14:46.250 --> 14:48.930]  I couldn't read if that was a one or a four.
[14:48.930 --> 14:52.490]  That's not in my budget to spend on a glass rig to tell you the damn truth.
[14:52.490 --> 14:53.850]  It would be awesome to have.
[14:53.850 --> 14:57.250]  I would just stare at it and take dabs out of it and then stare at it some more.
[14:57.250 --> 14:58.450]  So I mentioned this on Facebook.
[14:58.450 --> 15:00.450]  I posted up to Facebook and Instagram.
[15:00.450 --> 15:03.250]  I pretty much told the same story, hit my head.
[15:03.250 --> 15:04.250]  My eyes were fucked up.
[15:04.250 --> 15:07.170]  And then I saw this rig and I was mesmerized and then I'm in love with it.
[15:07.170 --> 15:13.330]  So I posted a picture of the rig and the artist that made the rig contacted me and sent me
[15:13.330 --> 15:15.650]  a sweet pendant.
[15:15.650 --> 15:16.810]  He sent me a disc pendant.
[15:16.810 --> 15:21.370]  It's probably a, the size, it's bigger than a silver dollar, just a little bit bigger
[15:21.370 --> 15:25.010]  than a silver dollar or a, yeah, a little bigger than a silver dollar.
[15:25.010 --> 15:26.250]  It's got some great ready work.
[15:26.250 --> 15:30.130]  It's got a, it's got a fucking, it's got an Opal in the middle of it.
[15:30.130 --> 15:31.130]  I always forgot the name of the Opals.
[15:31.130 --> 15:32.970]  It's got an Opal in the middle of it.
[15:32.970 --> 15:36.850]  I wore it on a chain to the secret session the other night and everybody told me how
[15:36.850 --> 15:38.450]  dope my pendee was.
[15:38.450 --> 15:43.250]  And you know what guys with blue eyes, all of my friends with blue eyes and blonde hair
[15:43.250 --> 15:47.170]  or like close to the ginger side of life, all of them would look at it and they would
[15:47.170 --> 15:51.530]  make the same fucking memorized mesmerized face that I make.
[15:51.530 --> 15:54.170]  It's something with blue eyes.
[15:54.170 --> 15:57.810]  And a friend of mine is, she does eye stuff.
[15:57.810 --> 16:01.050]  I always say the name of her career wrong, but she does eye stuff and she's like, well,
[16:01.050 --> 16:02.050]  I could teach you why.
[16:02.050 --> 16:05.090]  And I was like, no, I don't want to learn about my eyes because if you tell me what
[16:05.090 --> 16:07.570]  my eyes are doing, I'll start feeling it and it'll fuck with me.
[16:07.570 --> 16:08.570]  I don't want to know.
[16:08.570 --> 16:13.450]  When you say eye stuff, are we talking like American medical association certified ophthalmologist?
[16:13.450 --> 16:16.410]  Are we talking like blow sage smoke?
[16:16.410 --> 16:17.930]  No, no, she works at it.
[16:17.930 --> 16:20.610]  She wears scrubs and goes to an eye place every day.
[16:20.610 --> 16:21.610]  Yeah.
[16:21.610 --> 16:22.610]  She's, she's professional.
[16:22.610 --> 16:23.610]  We know both types of people.
[16:23.610 --> 16:24.610]  Yeah, we do.
[16:24.610 --> 16:25.970]  Eye stuff isn't real clear.
[16:25.970 --> 16:29.690]  I got friends that could fucking rub some knock chomp on your face and tell me which
[16:29.690 --> 16:33.490]  person you care to keep my bifocals from fucking me up.
[16:33.490 --> 16:36.010]  She works with a very well-known doctor here in the area.
[16:36.010 --> 16:37.010]  Just double check it.
[16:37.010 --> 16:38.010]  Yes.
[16:38.010 --> 16:39.010]  She's professional.
[16:39.010 --> 16:40.010]  She's bad as shit at what she does.
[16:40.010 --> 16:41.850]  You can tell she's good at it because she comes home and you can tell that she's proud
[16:41.850 --> 16:42.850]  of what she did.
[16:42.850 --> 16:43.850]  So shout out, good work.
[16:43.850 --> 16:49.050]  So I love that there's a style of art that only mesmerizes gingers.
[16:49.050 --> 16:52.170]  Yeah, but she, this, my friend knows why.
[16:52.170 --> 16:53.170]  Or blondes.
[16:53.170 --> 16:54.170]  Yeah.
[16:54.170 --> 16:56.450]  She knows, she can explain why it's something with the rods and cones in my blue eyes that
[16:56.450 --> 16:57.450]  do it.
[16:57.450 --> 17:01.210]  But Cameron Reed glass, dude, thank you for the sweet pendant.
[17:01.210 --> 17:02.210]  I love it.
[17:02.210 --> 17:03.210]  I thought it was dope as shit.
[17:03.210 --> 17:04.250]  It does move.
[17:04.250 --> 17:07.090]  It spins around just like that rig that you made, bro.
[17:07.090 --> 17:08.090]  So it's awesome.
[17:08.090 --> 17:11.290]  If I hold it still in the palm of my hand, it looks like it's fucking spinning and it's
[17:11.290 --> 17:12.330]  so awesome.
[17:12.330 --> 17:13.330]  I love it.
[17:13.810 --> 17:14.810]  Thank you.
[17:14.810 --> 17:15.810]  Thank you.
[17:15.810 --> 17:16.810]  Thank you.
[17:16.810 --> 17:17.810]  Thank you.
[17:17.810 --> 17:18.810]  Thank you.
[17:18.810 --> 17:19.810]  Thank you.
[17:19.810 --> 17:20.810]  Thank you.
[17:20.810 --> 17:21.810]  Thank you.
[17:21.810 --> 17:22.810]  Thank you a lot.
[17:22.810 --> 17:23.810]  I hope you hear this.
[17:23.810 --> 17:24.810]  I hope somebody tags you or tells you to listen to this podcast.
[17:24.810 --> 17:25.810]  Somehow I appreciate it.
[17:25.810 --> 17:26.810]  Also shout out to all my friends at elevate glass because that's where I saw it.
[17:26.810 --> 17:27.810]  Make sure you guys follow Cameron Reed glass.
[17:27.810 --> 17:28.810]  He makes sweet glass and he's a cool ass dude.
[17:28.810 --> 17:29.810]  So shout out.
[17:29.810 --> 17:30.810]  I appreciate it.
[17:30.810 --> 17:31.810]  That was a cool fucking gift to open up the mailbox one day and find this cool ass pendant.
[17:31.810 --> 17:33.170]  All my friends loved it too at the secret sesh.
[17:33.170 --> 17:35.570]  So I had the dopest pen at the sesh.
[17:35.570 --> 17:36.570]  All right.
[17:36.570 --> 17:40.170]  Uh, let's get to the, uh, the main topic of this podcast.
[17:40.170 --> 17:43.570]  I've got a couple of screenshots here because I like to screenshot the messages.
[17:43.570 --> 17:45.570]  It makes it much easier for me to find them.
[17:45.570 --> 17:46.570]  It really does.
[17:46.570 --> 17:47.570]  We've got a really quick message.
[17:47.570 --> 17:48.570]  This one came from Instagram.
[17:48.570 --> 17:53.570]  Um, usually I don't say the names, but this dude, he's from North Carolina and his name
[17:53.570 --> 17:54.970]  is Carolina cannabis.
[17:54.970 --> 17:56.490]  So follow him on Instagram.
[17:56.490 --> 18:01.810]  Uh, he says, what's something I can use for food for plants besides, besides buying nutrients
[18:01.810 --> 18:06.570]  in a bottle growing outdoors in North Carolina, only a few weeks of flowering left.
[18:06.570 --> 18:11.930]  Surprisingly buds are decently fat, but I know she's probably hungry for something.
[18:11.930 --> 18:15.530]  I'm going to try to get this episode out to you as soon as we can, uh, because you need
[18:15.530 --> 18:17.370]  this information pretty quickly.
[18:17.370 --> 18:23.170]  Um, you say only a few weeks left of flowering.
[18:23.170 --> 18:25.170]  So you need to be, you can't do anything in a bottle.
[18:25.170 --> 18:28.730]  So you're looking for like around the house style, probably.
[18:28.730 --> 18:29.730]  Okay.
[18:29.730 --> 18:34.010]  See that's, but, but then the grower in me says, where's Jesse when we need him.
[18:34.010 --> 18:36.010]  Jesse is on the coast right now having a good time.
[18:36.450 --> 18:38.130]  I think Jesse's in Portland is where I think he is.
[18:38.130 --> 18:39.130]  So shout out, bro.
[18:39.130 --> 18:40.130]  I hope you're having a good time.
[18:40.130 --> 18:41.130]  Hashtag earned it.
[18:41.130 --> 18:42.130]  Yeah, yeah, we can.
[18:42.130 --> 18:43.130]  Yeah.
[18:43.130 --> 18:44.130]  He cut off his ponytail.
[18:44.130 --> 18:45.130]  He looks so handsome now.
[18:45.130 --> 18:46.130]  Uh, but anyway, cleaned up.
[18:46.130 --> 18:50.890]  Uh, so Mike, Mike nailed what I thought most people would say.
[18:50.890 --> 18:52.510]  You want to use some guanos.
[18:52.510 --> 18:54.610]  You're going to want to use some Alfalfa meal.
[18:54.610 --> 18:58.170]  You're going to want to use something like that, but you've only got a couple of weeks
[18:58.170 --> 19:01.050]  left so you don't want to pump a whole bunch of stuff into the plants.
[19:01.050 --> 19:05.530]  And if most of those organic products are going to take at least two weeks to four weeks
[19:06.050 --> 19:09.050]  to closer to six or eight weeks to even break down and be available.
[19:09.050 --> 19:10.050]  You missed your shot.
[19:10.050 --> 19:12.250]  Yeah, there are a few things.
[19:12.250 --> 19:13.810]  There's some good news though.
[19:13.810 --> 19:18.250]  Nature wise, the plants supposed to have used up most of what's around it by now.
[19:18.250 --> 19:19.250]  Yes.
[19:19.250 --> 19:20.250]  Like that's as intended.
[19:20.250 --> 19:23.850]  So, but there are a couple of things that you can do if you don't want to go buy bottles.
[19:23.850 --> 19:25.330]  You've only got a few weeks left.
[19:25.330 --> 19:27.450]  So keep in mind that you're going to want to flush.
[19:27.450 --> 19:28.850]  Even outdoors, you need to flush your plants.
[19:28.850 --> 19:32.570]  You need a time period where they're not receiving any nutrients so that they can start to get
[19:32.570 --> 19:37.010]  rid of the shit that's stored up in them so that your buds burn and taste and smell
[19:37.010 --> 19:39.010]  perfectly at the right time.
[19:39.010 --> 19:40.610]  So keep that in mind.
[19:40.610 --> 19:44.890]  Give yourself hopefully 10 to 14, maybe 15 to 16, maybe 20 days.
[19:44.890 --> 19:46.050]  I like to flush for a long time.
[19:46.050 --> 19:49.510]  Well, if you haven't been feeding up to this point either, you don't want to hit them with
[19:49.510 --> 19:51.810]  too much now you'll shock the hell out of them.
[19:51.810 --> 19:55.530]  You probably, if he says he knows they're probably hungry for something and if he hasn't
[19:55.530 --> 19:57.570]  boosted them up, they probably are.
[19:57.570 --> 20:02.650]  And what I would recommend if you want to feed them something, like I said earlier,
[20:02.650 --> 20:04.010]  some guanos would be cool.
[20:04.010 --> 20:07.210]  Some stuff like that would be cool, but some comfrey would be nice.
[20:07.210 --> 20:08.850]  Maybe make up a nice tea.
[20:08.850 --> 20:10.110]  That's probably your best bet.
[20:10.110 --> 20:12.290]  Make a tea.
[20:12.290 --> 20:16.970]  A tea with some worm castings, some alfalfa meal in there.
[20:16.970 --> 20:20.890]  Maybe put a little tiny bit of molasses in there just to keep it moving.
[20:20.890 --> 20:23.850]  And then any sort of kelp meal or something, make a tea out of that.
[20:23.850 --> 20:24.850]  And this is just coming to me.
[20:24.850 --> 20:27.650]  I'm trying to go as smoothly as I can here.
[20:27.650 --> 20:32.330]  Maybe put some, I'm not sure what all you are willing to use either, but kelp meal would
[20:32.330 --> 20:35.490]  definitely help you get some bulk and some flavor.
[20:35.490 --> 20:38.570]  Maybe put some fish hydrosolates in there that would help you out with some nitrogen.
[20:38.570 --> 20:44.090]  And that's if you make a tea like this, brew it up for just a couple of few days.
[20:44.090 --> 20:47.170]  And if you need instructions on making a tea, send me an email and we'll try to get Jesse
[20:47.170 --> 20:48.250]  on here to help us with that.
[20:48.250 --> 20:49.250]  But I'll answer you.
[20:49.250 --> 20:50.410]  You sent me this message on Instagram.
[20:50.410 --> 20:53.810]  So send me a message on Instagram and hopefully I can run you through making a tea.
[20:53.810 --> 20:54.810]  It's really easy.
[20:54.810 --> 20:57.570]  But make a tea, feed the plants the tea.
[20:57.570 --> 21:03.370]  If you can't make a tea, then some basic fish hydrosolates in a bottle would work.
[21:03.370 --> 21:07.130]  Pour that, put some water into a five gallon bucket, put a little more than what the label
[21:07.130 --> 21:11.090]  says of fish hydrosolates in there, mix it up real well, put some molasses in there,
[21:11.090 --> 21:12.410]  mix that up.
[21:12.410 --> 21:13.690]  And then maybe some kelp.
[21:13.690 --> 21:15.890]  Any sort of kelp product that you can put in there.
[21:15.890 --> 21:18.370]  Liquid kelp would be more available, but that's a bottled product.
[21:18.370 --> 21:22.610]  If you don't want to do that, I think a tea would be your best way to go.
[21:22.610 --> 21:25.130]  Jesse and I have done episodes about making teas.
[21:25.130 --> 21:27.290]  That is a thing that's available.
[21:27.290 --> 21:28.930]  If you don't want to search for that, send me a message.
[21:28.930 --> 21:32.650]  I'll either find it for you or I will reply to you on Instagram.
[21:32.650 --> 21:34.490]  I was just doing the math in my head.
[21:34.490 --> 21:37.010]  This is going to come out.
[21:37.010 --> 21:44.290]  If this show doesn't come out immediately, he's only got three weeks from when we're
[21:44.290 --> 21:47.710]  recording it at most of grow time left.
[21:47.710 --> 21:50.850]  If he's on the East Coast, if I've got my numbers right in my head.
[21:50.850 --> 21:53.450]  Some of our friends in Colorado are actually harvesting this.
[21:53.450 --> 21:59.370]  I talked to people higher up in elevation than we are down here in Pueblo that are a
[21:59.370 --> 22:01.730]  little further up into the foothills.
[22:01.730 --> 22:04.650]  Harvest began last week.
[22:04.650 --> 22:07.570]  And I mean, they're dipping below 50 at night.
[22:07.570 --> 22:08.570]  This is what's up.
[22:08.570 --> 22:09.570]  The plants are done.
[22:09.570 --> 22:10.570]  You should see them.
[22:10.570 --> 22:11.570]  They're huge.
[22:11.570 --> 22:13.050]  I actually went to two different grows.
[22:13.050 --> 22:17.130]  One that was about 700 feet higher up in elevation than the other.
[22:17.130 --> 22:20.410]  And I went to the higher one first.
[22:20.970 --> 22:21.970]  Buds were almost done.
[22:21.970 --> 22:24.530]  They were going to give them three more days at harvest.
[22:24.530 --> 22:28.770]  I drove down the road a few hundred feet and buds were three weeks from harvest.
[22:28.770 --> 22:29.770]  Wow.
[22:29.770 --> 22:31.370]  Just a little bit closer to the sun.
[22:31.370 --> 22:32.370]  Yep.
[22:32.370 --> 22:33.370]  And which side of the mountain?
[22:33.370 --> 22:34.370]  Our side.
[22:34.370 --> 22:35.370]  Okay.
[22:35.370 --> 22:39.570]  So what are we east of the Rockies?
[22:39.570 --> 22:40.970]  We both had to think about that.
[22:40.970 --> 22:42.810]  Yeah, because the mountains are west.
[22:42.810 --> 22:43.810]  And so I had to quick do the...
[22:43.810 --> 22:46.170]  So I know which direction I'm going.
[22:46.170 --> 22:47.410]  People are like, how do you always know where you're going?
[22:47.410 --> 22:49.250]  The mountains are right over there all the time.
[22:49.250 --> 22:52.370]  If you've been to Colorado more than a year, you know how to get to wherever you're going
[22:52.370 --> 22:53.370]  because of that.
[22:53.370 --> 22:54.370]  So check it out.
[22:54.370 --> 22:56.450]  Since Mike was talking for a second, I got a chance to write this down.
[22:56.450 --> 22:59.250]  If you need to make a tea, get yourself a five gallon bucket.
[22:59.250 --> 23:00.250]  Get a clean bucket.
[23:00.250 --> 23:02.690]  Go to Lowe's, pay a couple bucks, get a clean bucket.
[23:02.690 --> 23:05.770]  Get yourself, go to the hydro store or the fish store.
[23:05.770 --> 23:08.930]  Get some, an air pump that pumps out quite a bit of air.
[23:08.930 --> 23:10.810]  Get yourself one of those air stones.
[23:10.810 --> 23:14.370]  Put the air stone in the bucket to where, fill the bucket with water.
[23:14.370 --> 23:17.890]  If you can, put the air stone in there and get that air stone pumping that water with
[23:17.890 --> 23:20.730]  a lot of oxygen for 24 hours before you do anything.
[23:20.730 --> 23:23.410]  Your goal here is to get the chlorine out of that water.
[23:23.410 --> 23:24.530]  That's what you're trying to do.
[23:24.530 --> 23:26.610]  So bubble that, get the chlorine out.
[23:26.610 --> 23:31.770]  The next day, add some worm castings, add some alfalfa sprouts, add some kelp meal and
[23:31.770 --> 23:34.130]  add a little tiny bit of molasses.
[23:34.130 --> 23:36.890]  Let that bubble for like 24 hours.
[23:36.890 --> 23:38.450]  It's going to get foamy.
[23:38.450 --> 23:39.890]  Expect it to get foamy.
[23:39.890 --> 23:44.730]  It will foam up like a beer and go everywhere if you're not careful.
[23:44.730 --> 23:46.050]  It may or may not.
[23:46.050 --> 23:47.450]  It depends on your witch's brew.
[23:48.010 --> 23:49.130]  So proteins in the fish hydrosolates.
[23:49.130 --> 23:51.330]  I didn't write fish hydrosolates, but fish hydrosolates in there.
[23:51.330 --> 23:52.330]  The proteins of the fish hydrosolates.
[23:52.330 --> 23:55.170]  I helped a guy shampoo the smell out of his carpet one time.
[23:55.170 --> 23:58.610]  So just fair warning listeners, be careful what your witch's brew does the first time
[23:58.610 --> 23:59.610]  you make it.
[23:59.610 --> 24:01.250]  Cause sometimes it foams up like a song.
[24:01.250 --> 24:02.250]  Yes.
[24:02.250 --> 24:04.970]  What I would recommend, um, this will make enough.
[24:04.970 --> 24:08.450]  If you use this five gallon bucket, you could probably cut this in half.
[24:08.450 --> 24:10.930]  Or if you're going outdoor, you can just pour the whole five gallon bucket on there if you
[24:10.930 --> 24:11.930]  want to.
[24:11.930 --> 24:13.330]  Uh, but it's getting toward the end of the season.
[24:13.330 --> 24:14.410]  Keep that in mind.
[24:14.410 --> 24:15.410]  It's almost time to harvest.
[24:15.410 --> 24:16.410]  You don't want to go huge.
[24:16.410 --> 24:19.690]  So take your five gallon bucket, pour the, put the bubble, fill it with water, put the
[24:19.690 --> 24:22.130]  bubble in there, bubble it long enough to get the chlorine off.
[24:22.130 --> 24:26.210]  Then you pour in the fish hydrosolates, worm castings, uh, alfalfa sprouts.
[24:26.210 --> 24:27.210]  Is that the right one?
[24:27.210 --> 24:28.210]  Is that what I want to use?
[24:28.210 --> 24:29.210]  I think that's what you want.
[24:29.210 --> 24:30.210]  Kelp meal and molasses.
[24:30.210 --> 24:31.210]  Pour those things in there.
[24:31.210 --> 24:32.490]  There are more things that you could use.
[24:32.490 --> 24:33.490]  You could use crab meal.
[24:33.490 --> 24:34.570]  You could bone use bone meal.
[24:34.570 --> 24:36.490]  You can use fish meal if you want to.
[24:36.490 --> 24:38.430]  Those things are not all necessary.
[24:38.430 --> 24:39.430]  Put that in there.
[24:39.430 --> 24:42.610]  Let that shit stew around in that bubbles for like 12 to 24 hours.
[24:42.610 --> 24:43.930]  It's going to make a bunch of foam.
[24:43.930 --> 24:45.410]  Uh, do it in the garage.
[24:45.410 --> 24:48.490]  If you have to do it somewhere, it's easy to clean up where you're not worried about
[24:48.490 --> 24:49.490]  a bunch of foam.
[24:49.490 --> 24:51.530]  If it does not foam up, that does not mean it's bad.
[24:51.530 --> 24:53.610]  Uh, let it bubble up.
[24:53.610 --> 24:56.490]  Then, uh, go outside and pour it on your plants.
[24:56.490 --> 25:00.210]  Not on the plants zone and water your plants with it.
[25:00.210 --> 25:01.490]  Don't go near the stock.
[25:01.490 --> 25:05.130]  Go out because your roots that eat the most and drink the most are the ones that are on
[25:05.130 --> 25:06.690]  the outer perimeter of the plant.
[25:06.690 --> 25:07.690]  Not right there at the stock.
[25:07.690 --> 25:10.450]  The part of the stock is always going to have some moisture down there at the bottom.
[25:10.450 --> 25:11.970]  Go on the outer edge.
[25:11.970 --> 25:12.970]  That's where you're growing roots are.
[25:12.970 --> 25:14.930]  And the plants are reaching out for, for stuff.
[25:15.450 --> 25:16.450]  So keep, go out there a little bit.
[25:16.450 --> 25:19.970]  So your best bet is to make a tea water with this tea.
[25:19.970 --> 25:22.170]  And then hopefully you'll see a little bit of boost in there.
[25:22.170 --> 25:24.650]  Uh, the fish hydroslates are going to give you a little bit of nitrogen.
[25:24.650 --> 25:28.730]  The worm castings are going to give you, uh, microbes and it's going to help everything.
[25:28.730 --> 25:32.010]  The worm castings will provide a little tiny bit of nitrogen, but they'll also speed everything
[25:32.010 --> 25:33.010]  up.
[25:33.010 --> 25:36.170]  The alfalfa meal is going to give you nitrogen that's readily available.
[25:36.170 --> 25:37.170]  The kelp meal.
[25:37.170 --> 25:40.090]  Uh, I just think that that makes everything stink.
[25:40.090 --> 25:41.450]  It makes it smell better.
[25:41.450 --> 25:42.490]  It makes it taste better.
[25:42.490 --> 25:43.490]  And it adds to the density.
[25:43.530 --> 25:46.530]  So for those of you to organic growers, one of the first thing that comes up is kelp.
[25:46.530 --> 25:47.530]  Yeah.
[25:47.530 --> 25:50.850]  The ocean products are always going to make your stuff taste better in my opinion.
[25:50.850 --> 25:55.730]  And then molasses, molasses will actually feed all of the worm casting microbes and
[25:55.730 --> 25:58.810]  it will also feed your plants a little bit as well.
[25:58.810 --> 26:02.530]  So that's what you can do outdoors, but also keep in mind, bro, it's time to start flushing.
[26:02.530 --> 26:05.130]  So you're right at the end of your clock, bud.
[26:05.130 --> 26:08.210]  And sorry, we didn't get this question sooner and out to you sooner.
[26:08.210 --> 26:11.410]  I'm not blaming anything on Jesse, but man, Jesse was busy as shit this year.
[26:11.410 --> 26:13.290]  So we didn't do many outdoor episodes.
[26:14.090 --> 26:17.770]  Jesse, let's just sit down and record a whole season of outdoor shit.
[26:17.770 --> 26:20.290]  Get him once and do 11 episodes in one little day.
[26:20.290 --> 26:21.290]  He's hard to nail down.
[26:21.290 --> 26:24.530]  He came by the other day and smoked me down with some distillate that his company's making
[26:24.530 --> 26:25.530]  and it was delicious.
[26:25.530 --> 26:29.450]  The last time I saw him in person, I asked him how's it going and he went on for like
[26:29.450 --> 26:31.890]  45 minutes about projects he's currently working on.
[26:31.890 --> 26:35.290]  I mean, he's usually one of the three busiest people I know.
[26:35.290 --> 26:36.290]  Yes.
[26:36.290 --> 26:38.290]  Shout out to our friend, Carolina Cannabis on Instagram.
[26:38.290 --> 26:39.290]  Make sure you guys follow him.
[26:39.290 --> 26:43.290]  I think he's got his beautiful cannabis growing skills and photography.
[26:43.290 --> 26:44.810]  And dude, thank you for the message.
[26:44.810 --> 26:46.510]  Feel free to send me more messages.
[26:46.510 --> 26:47.970]  I want to see how your growth comes out.
[26:47.970 --> 26:50.810]  I want to know if I answered your question in the way you needed to answer it.
[26:50.810 --> 26:52.810]  Anybody else that has a message, please send it to me.
[26:52.810 --> 27:00.370]  It would be easiest if you initiate a conversation by sending me an email to growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[27:00.370 --> 27:04.090]  If we're already corresponding on another social media platform, keep it going.
[27:04.090 --> 27:06.970]  It's easiest just to keep one conversation happening because if you jump to another platform,
[27:06.970 --> 27:08.350]  I'm going to fucking get confused.
[27:08.410 --> 27:10.910]  But if you're new, go to growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[27:10.910 --> 27:15.030]  That's the best way to get in touch with me and I'll get your questions on an upcoming episode.
[27:15.030 --> 27:18.390]  I'm trying to get through the questions quickly because I know some of the questions are urgent
[27:18.390 --> 27:20.350]  because you got plants growing and you need shit to happen.
[27:20.350 --> 27:24.310]  So I'm trying to get on it, trying to do more episodes for you.
[27:24.310 --> 27:30.830]  So I've got another thing I want to read before I get to the basement and legislation question
[27:30.830 --> 27:31.910]  that I've got.
[27:31.910 --> 27:34.730]  I saw something on Facebook the other day and I thought it was very entertaining.
[27:34.730 --> 27:38.730]  Right after I did an episode about trim machines, in a recent episode we talked about trim machines
[27:38.730 --> 27:40.930]  and I kind of bashed the shit out of them.
[27:40.930 --> 27:42.210]  Somebody said, which trim machine to buy?
[27:42.210 --> 27:44.730]  And I said, don't buy a bunch of fucking scissors and get your friends over.
[27:44.730 --> 27:47.450]  That's basically what I told them because that's really what I think you should do.
[27:47.450 --> 27:49.250]  No, that's preach it brother.
[27:49.250 --> 27:53.490]  And somebody on Facebook, I don't know if he wants to be named or not.
[27:53.490 --> 27:55.690]  He's known as Soda Pop.
[27:55.690 --> 27:58.090]  He says, uptiming Croptober helpful hints.
[27:58.090 --> 27:59.210]  And we call it Croptober.
[27:59.210 --> 28:02.170]  Yes, October is Croptober in Colorado.
[28:02.170 --> 28:03.170]  Everybody needs a trimmer.
[28:03.170 --> 28:07.770]  Yeah, every California, the whole coast, but okay.
[28:07.770 --> 28:10.450]  So I've seen trimmer, get trimmer, grant memes recently.
[28:10.450 --> 28:13.290]  So I get to sing in lots of places.
[28:13.290 --> 28:14.730]  Trimmer grants are coming.
[28:14.730 --> 28:18.330]  So a helpful Croptober or upcoming Croptober helpful hints.
[28:18.330 --> 28:23.130]  And this dude says, number one, if you want to process your trim into quality meds, please
[28:23.130 --> 28:31.810]  do not use a machine trimmer oils from machine and the beaten trim lead to unsightly slabs.
[28:31.810 --> 28:35.850]  So he's saying that there's oils actually in the trim machine, on the blades of the
[28:35.850 --> 28:39.250]  trim machine, on the metal parts of the trim machine, that shit's got to be lubricated
[28:39.250 --> 28:40.250]  somewhere.
[28:40.250 --> 28:43.890]  Every auto trimmer I have ever used had moving parts which require lubrication.
[28:43.890 --> 28:44.890]  Yep.
[28:44.890 --> 28:49.090]  So those oils will end up on your trim and that beaten up trim, like I said before, it
[28:49.090 --> 28:51.250]  turns into basically mulch.
[28:51.250 --> 28:55.450]  And that when the trim is cut into so many pieces, it's so when you cut it with scissors,
[28:55.450 --> 28:57.570]  you cut it one time, you cut that leaf off the plant.
[28:57.570 --> 28:59.050]  I mean, maybe three or four.
[28:59.050 --> 29:03.410]  I mean, it most, but you're not making like you're not turning it into pet.
[29:03.410 --> 29:04.410]  You're not lawnmower.
[29:04.410 --> 29:05.410]  Yeah.
[29:05.410 --> 29:08.570]  This trim machines hitting it and just mulching all your little pieces.
[29:08.570 --> 29:13.690]  And that leaves that many spots for moisture, that much surface area for moisture and that
[29:13.690 --> 29:15.630]  many spots for chlorophyll to come out.
[29:15.630 --> 29:21.890]  You want, you want to hit it with scissors, but so that all that comes into the product.
[29:21.890 --> 29:23.570]  I mean, it's, it's not good.
[29:23.570 --> 29:24.570]  It does juice it.
[29:24.570 --> 29:28.210]  And then that juice ends up in your hash and it tastes like shit and looks like shit.
[29:28.210 --> 29:32.850]  And then number two, he says, if you plan to process the nug, please flush correctly
[29:32.850 --> 29:37.010]  and no spring or pesticides whatsoever.
[29:37.010 --> 29:45.090]  These chemicals and nutrients tend to leach into concentration and lead to unsightly slabs.
[29:45.090 --> 29:48.050]  So he's saying flush properly, flush correctly.
[29:48.050 --> 29:53.170]  He's using unsightly and there's a lot implied there, especially in a market like Colorado's.
[29:53.170 --> 29:54.170]  Yes.
[29:54.170 --> 29:59.410]  If you've sprayed your plants with just about anything while they're in flower and it's
[29:59.410 --> 30:03.690]  processed into a concentrate, that concentrates not going to pass testing and make it onto
[30:03.690 --> 30:04.690]  the market.
[30:04.690 --> 30:08.410]  Most of the people he's talking about, I think he's talking about these black market street
[30:08.410 --> 30:09.410]  growers.
[30:09.410 --> 30:10.410]  Well, yeah, it's, I mean, unsightly.
[30:10.410 --> 30:13.690]  Because most of us in a warehouse environment know this.
[30:13.690 --> 30:15.930]  It's none of this is going to make it onto a...
[30:15.930 --> 30:16.930]  Right.
[30:16.930 --> 30:17.930]  No spring.
[30:17.930 --> 30:19.730]  That's absolutely, if you're going to make concentrates, think about this.
[30:19.730 --> 30:21.130]  You guys are going to spray some shit.
[30:21.130 --> 30:22.130]  Okay.
[30:22.130 --> 30:23.130]  You're spraying.
[30:23.130 --> 30:24.130]  What is everybody using?
[30:24.130 --> 30:27.010]  Azomax is probably one of the most popular things.
[30:27.010 --> 30:31.330]  When I worked in the dispensary area, I've toured a couple of dispensaries and all of
[30:31.330 --> 30:32.930]  them have Azomax on the shelf.
[30:32.930 --> 30:34.410]  That's what the most common spray.
[30:34.410 --> 30:38.730]  And we're going to talk about something that Azomax is going to do in a future episode
[30:38.730 --> 30:40.270]  that I've got written down.
[30:40.270 --> 30:42.890]  But everyone's got the Azomax.
[30:42.890 --> 30:45.210]  I'm sure you spray, it's kind of waxy.
[30:45.210 --> 30:46.210]  It's kind of oily.
[30:46.210 --> 30:49.970]  You spray Azomax onto your plants at probably, I don't know, week two, week three.
[30:49.970 --> 30:52.570]  That shit's in the middle of your buds as your bud grows around it.
[30:53.010 --> 30:56.930]  That waxy, oily concentration is still there and the buds just grow around it and it's
[30:56.930 --> 30:58.530]  still inside there.
[30:58.530 --> 31:02.570]  Then the buds dry and he grinded up and you run it through an extraction machine and wash
[31:02.570 --> 31:03.570]  it off.
[31:03.570 --> 31:08.210]  You can actually see that little layer of Azomax right on top of your concentrate.
[31:08.210 --> 31:09.210]  Sometimes I've seen it.
[31:09.210 --> 31:10.490]  I've seen it float to the top.
[31:10.490 --> 31:12.370]  I have fucking tasted it.
[31:12.370 --> 31:15.050]  Like I've been in rooms that have, I have sprayed.
[31:15.050 --> 31:16.610]  I didn't know any better when I started growing.
[31:16.610 --> 31:19.370]  But remember the back in the day when we did not know any better, we would spray whatever
[31:19.370 --> 31:20.610]  the fuck to do to the hydro.
[31:20.610 --> 31:21.770]  I've got this problem.
[31:21.770 --> 31:22.770]  Spray this.
[31:22.770 --> 31:23.770]  Okay.
[31:23.770 --> 31:26.650]  And then you read five years later like this causes immediate blindness.
[31:26.650 --> 31:27.850]  If you touch it, you're like, Oh fuck.
[31:27.850 --> 31:29.490]  I used to spray that.
[31:29.490 --> 31:31.090]  Like I've sprayed these things.
[31:31.090 --> 31:33.610]  So I've also smelled them.
[31:33.610 --> 31:38.450]  I'm glad I did because now I can smell them and taste them in other people's products.
[31:38.450 --> 31:39.650]  Neem oil is a big one.
[31:39.650 --> 31:41.250]  It's a God.
[31:41.250 --> 31:45.970]  It's something a lot of the organic or the natural people like to use at one point or
[31:45.970 --> 31:46.970]  another.
[31:46.970 --> 31:51.730]  And if you use that shit and flour, my face puckered up a little when you said it's,
[31:52.690 --> 31:57.250]  everybody that consumes cannabis at one point or another has hit a bowl and all they tasted
[31:57.250 --> 31:59.650]  for the next hour was Neem.
[31:59.650 --> 32:04.410]  They might not have known what it was, but it's, I mean, that's incredibly common.
[32:04.410 --> 32:06.410]  Just quit spraying shit that's in flour.
[32:06.410 --> 32:07.890]  Terrible, terrible, terrible.
[32:07.890 --> 32:09.250]  Man, Joe environment.
[32:09.250 --> 32:10.250]  Yeah.
[32:10.250 --> 32:13.250]  So flush correctly and don't spray bullshit on your plants.
[32:13.250 --> 32:15.730]  If you're trying to make concentrates out of it, you know, that's a general rule.
[32:15.730 --> 32:18.690]  If you're trying, if you're going to use and make, if you're making medicine or something,
[32:18.690 --> 32:23.770]  you want other people to consume a flush properly and don't spray shit on your plants.
[32:23.770 --> 32:29.410]  Number three, uh, take proper care of nug and trim that would be for use in extracts,
[32:29.410 --> 32:34.010]  proper cure care, cleaning and basic hygiene of the plant and material are critical for
[32:34.010 --> 32:35.010]  quality meds.
[32:35.010 --> 32:40.690]  You guys, one thing that I don't see enough of is people wearing nitrile or rubber gloves.
[32:40.690 --> 32:41.770]  Wear some gloves.
[32:41.770 --> 32:46.050]  You don't want all your finger skin in my concentrates or on my flowers.
[32:46.210 --> 32:48.530]  When you're trimming that shit is sticky.
[32:48.530 --> 32:49.530]  Wear some gloves, please.
[32:49.530 --> 32:50.850]  I don't want to smoke your skin flakes.
[32:50.850 --> 32:51.850]  We're bros.
[32:51.850 --> 32:52.850]  We're friends.
[32:52.850 --> 32:53.850]  I love you.
[32:53.850 --> 32:55.490]  I do not want to smoke your fucking hands.
[32:55.490 --> 32:59.810]  Also, uh, take care of stuff just cause it's going to get turned into hash.
[32:59.810 --> 33:03.290]  Doesn't mean you can trim your trim, your leaves into a tarp on the floor and have the
[33:03.290 --> 33:06.850]  whole crew walk on them during trim time and then sweep them up and make hash out of it.
[33:06.850 --> 33:07.850]  That's fucking gross.
[33:07.850 --> 33:09.170]  Trim that into a container.
[33:09.170 --> 33:10.170]  Take care of it.
[33:10.170 --> 33:11.170]  That's somebody's medicine.
[33:11.170 --> 33:12.890]  You may make edibles out of it.
[33:12.890 --> 33:16.170]  Think about like, look at it all as something that you're going to put into your mouth.
[33:16.170 --> 33:19.370]  And if you're one of them dirty fucking people to leash it off the floor, look at it as something
[33:19.370 --> 33:24.570]  that a princess has to put in their mouth because it's got to be clean products.
[33:24.570 --> 33:28.130]  Also cure your shit just cause you're going to blast it.
[33:28.130 --> 33:29.810]  I understand live resin.
[33:29.810 --> 33:30.810]  Let's get it on.
[33:30.810 --> 33:37.050]  Well, there was that weird thing at the beginning of the butane hash days where you made BHO
[33:37.050 --> 33:38.150]  with this stuff.
[33:38.150 --> 33:40.330]  You couldn't use the stuff that was trash.
[33:40.330 --> 33:44.210]  I remember people saying some crazy shit like, Oh, if it's moldy, just blast it.
[33:44.210 --> 33:47.730]  Powdery mildew doesn't exist anymore since we have BHO.
[33:47.730 --> 33:48.850]  Right.
[33:48.850 --> 33:55.530]  But if you want to make good concentrates, you really have to produce bud that's ready
[33:55.530 --> 33:56.970]  to go on a store shelf.
[33:56.970 --> 33:57.970]  Yes.
[33:57.970 --> 34:00.290]  And then make concentrates from that out of that.
[34:00.290 --> 34:04.850]  And I see so many people that fuck up that last step and it's like buying a Lamborghini
[34:04.850 --> 34:06.610]  and wrecking it like in the lot.
[34:06.610 --> 34:09.010]  You're not even off the lot yet.
[34:09.010 --> 34:10.010]  And you wreck it.
[34:10.690 --> 34:13.010]  You spend nine weeks flowering and then you just spend a week harvesting and I'm just
[34:13.010 --> 34:14.010]  going to fuck it up.
[34:14.010 --> 34:15.010]  Yeah.
[34:15.010 --> 34:16.010]  You might as well.
[34:16.010 --> 34:17.010]  You can take the trash.
[34:17.010 --> 34:21.850]  Once you flush that plant, you can cut it down and knock off most of the big leaves.
[34:21.850 --> 34:25.650]  And if you plan on blasting the entire plant, hang it up, let it, Oh, excuse me.
[34:25.650 --> 34:29.450]  I'm burping up some Dr. Pepper, hang it upside down, let it dry and cure, cut it off the
[34:29.450 --> 34:30.650]  sticks, take the sticks out of there.
[34:30.650 --> 34:33.090]  And then you've pretty much got blastable material.
[34:33.090 --> 34:34.410]  You can't really fuck that up.
[34:34.410 --> 34:35.730]  So just take care of it.
[34:35.730 --> 34:36.730]  Keep it clean.
[34:36.730 --> 34:37.730]  Wear gloves.
[34:37.730 --> 34:42.730]  I can't even believe some of the stuff that I've seen and heard of coming in from, uh,
[34:42.730 --> 34:46.170]  like grows coming into extraction labs.
[34:46.170 --> 34:52.910]  People have found cigarette butts, scissors, razor blades, forks from lunch, like all kinds
[34:52.910 --> 34:54.410]  of shit in the material.
[34:54.410 --> 34:59.930]  It was so bad, um, two years ago when we started implementing lab testing that a number of
[34:59.930 --> 35:05.690]  extract companies just went out and bought the a hundred thousand or 200 to 300,000 pieces
[35:05.690 --> 35:11.570]  of equipment, um, so that they could in-house lab tests shit as it came in because it was
[35:11.570 --> 35:14.530]  some of the stuff that we're processing was so nasty.
[35:14.530 --> 35:16.850]  It was fucking up their machines.
[35:16.850 --> 35:21.250]  And so they processed the dude for the first guy or the material for the first guy in the
[35:21.250 --> 35:24.170]  morning, it dirties up the machine.
[35:24.170 --> 35:28.610]  Everybody else that gets run that day is taking home a piece of that trash that came through
[35:28.610 --> 35:32.930]  in the morning, residual, um, as a max or now they're testing it all before it goes
[35:33.050 --> 35:34.690]  into the, into their machinery.
[35:34.690 --> 35:36.650]  So that none of that's possible anymore.
[35:37.930 --> 35:38.690]  That's disgusting.
[35:38.690 --> 35:42.930]  Thinking about somebody, another farm running some stuff and throwing some as a max in there.
[35:42.930 --> 35:46.370]  And then my farm running this clean organic product in there and just mixing it up.
[35:46.370 --> 35:48.610]  And now I've got your as a max residuals.
[35:48.970 --> 35:49.610]  That's kind of gross.
[35:49.610 --> 35:50.290]  I can think of that.
[35:50.290 --> 35:55.850]  When I see stuff like black market stuff, whether like just got some awesome sap and you
[35:55.850 --> 36:01.330]  look at it and it's black and soupy and it, God only knows what's in it.
[36:01.330 --> 36:06.930]  I mean, we're so lucky here that we've got lab tests, some regulation that we can get
[36:06.930 --> 36:07.650]  away from that.
[36:08.530 --> 36:11.130]  I wish it was more available to the recreational grower.
[36:11.210 --> 36:14.210]  Lab testing is not as available, but in the future it will be.
[36:14.610 --> 36:14.850]  Yep.
[36:14.850 --> 36:18.970]  That's one of the things that we're, I'm going to hit coming up in this last question.
[36:19.450 --> 36:19.810]  All right.
[36:19.810 --> 36:23.970]  So speaking of perfect timing, we're 36 minutes into this podcast and we have not gotten to
[36:23.970 --> 36:24.730]  the main topic.
[36:24.730 --> 36:30.290]  So, uh, shout out to Soda Pop for the cool, uh, Facebook post at the end, he hashtag that
[36:30.290 --> 36:32.690]  the machine knows the truth.
[36:33.130 --> 36:35.050]  So supports my claims that trim machines suck.
[36:35.050 --> 36:39.170]  Don't use a trim machine, take care of your plants and take care of the trim and nug.
[36:39.170 --> 36:42.730]  If you plan to make extra, actually it's good luck out there this crop tober season.
[36:42.730 --> 36:43.690]  I hope your plants made it.
[36:43.970 --> 36:45.370]  I hope none of them got stolen.
[36:45.610 --> 36:47.730]  I hope that it's one of the things to take your shit.
[36:48.330 --> 36:48.690]  Yeah.
[36:49.090 --> 36:50.010]  It's that time of year.
[36:50.050 --> 36:51.210]  Uh, we call it cropped over.
[36:51.210 --> 36:52.730]  We also call it homie season.
[36:53.490 --> 36:55.850]  Um, stuff goes missing right now.
[36:55.850 --> 36:56.090]  Yeah.
[36:56.090 --> 36:57.010]  Ripper season.
[36:57.010 --> 36:59.770]  I've, I've seen some social media stuff already.
[36:59.970 --> 37:01.330]  If they took your shit, they're not your homie.
[37:01.730 --> 37:05.490]  Well, right now it's, it's getting close to harvest.
[37:05.530 --> 37:08.930]  If you're growing outdoors in any way, shape or form, it's smelling.
[37:09.610 --> 37:11.330]  Um, and probably sleeping out there.
[37:11.410 --> 37:11.730]  Yep.
[37:11.770 --> 37:14.410]  And if my friends are sleeping outside, it's there.
[37:14.410 --> 37:15.210]  You're freaking out.
[37:15.730 --> 37:17.050]  Just take some deep breaths.
[37:17.050 --> 37:17.850]  Relax.
[37:18.410 --> 37:21.250]  Um, your shit getting stolen is not the worst thing that can happen to you.
[37:22.010 --> 37:24.250]  And if they did take your shit, I hope they left part of it for you.
[37:24.290 --> 37:25.330]  I hope they were a cool thief.
[37:25.330 --> 37:27.210]  And if you had four plants, I hope they only took one.
[37:27.770 --> 37:31.410]  It's, uh, it's just unfortunate that we still have to deal with this.
[37:31.650 --> 37:32.090]  Yes.
[37:32.570 --> 37:32.890]  All right.
[37:32.890 --> 37:34.130]  So I wish we could just grow out.
[37:34.130 --> 37:36.170]  So nobody comes to steal the tomatoes in the backyard.
[37:36.170 --> 37:37.250]  Why are they stealing cannabis?
[37:37.250 --> 37:40.050]  When cannabis is somebody's cancer medicine, you know, that's shitty.
[37:40.530 --> 37:42.650]  It's just worth so much in certain places.
[37:42.650 --> 37:46.890]  It's, I mean, it's like leaving your, your bank account in the backyard.
[37:46.890 --> 37:50.050]  In some places, nobody that listens to the show would steal any plants.
[37:50.890 --> 37:52.690]  Well, let's jump into this email that I got.
[37:52.890 --> 37:55.610]  Uh, this email, this dude signed his name, Dab Smiths.
[37:55.930 --> 37:57.010]  And he says, Hey, what's up?
[37:57.010 --> 37:58.770]  Ross and Jeff huge fan of the podcast.
[37:58.770 --> 38:03.810]  As I've said before, he said, I had a few questions I thought could be a podcast.
[38:04.090 --> 38:07.610]  I'm in Michigan and we just passed three bills pushing us into a seed to
[38:07.610 --> 38:09.810]  sale system based on Colorado system.
[38:10.490 --> 38:12.530]  I'm going to quickly talk about that in Colorado.
[38:12.650 --> 38:13.930]  We have a seed to sale system.
[38:13.930 --> 38:18.290]  Everything that is for sale recreational or medically in the state of Colorado
[38:18.290 --> 38:24.370]  has been grown, uh, from seed or a clone underneath a Colorado marijuana
[38:24.370 --> 38:28.850]  enforcement division camera inside of a Colorado marijuana enforcement
[38:28.850 --> 38:33.010]  division regulated facility, also known as an optional premises cultivation
[38:33.010 --> 38:36.610]  facility, everything that happens in there, every square fucking
[38:36.610 --> 38:38.370]  inch of this facility is on camera.
[38:38.770 --> 38:43.010]  They have it set up to where if you can be in that building and there is a
[38:43.010 --> 38:45.810]  spot where you're not on camera, you have to put another camera.
[38:45.850 --> 38:49.370]  If you can hide around this little partition or behind this door, they
[38:49.370 --> 38:52.450]  want another camera in there so that you cannot hide anywhere.
[38:52.650 --> 38:55.530]  So everything that happens in there is on camera, which that's
[38:55.530 --> 38:56.890]  where the seed part starts.
[38:57.130 --> 38:58.970]  Uh, if you grow a seed, it's on camera.
[38:58.970 --> 39:01.010]  If you grow a clone, it is on camera.
[39:01.010 --> 39:03.490]  It is a given an RFID tag.
[39:03.530 --> 39:04.690]  We call those a med tag.
[39:04.690 --> 39:08.410]  You have to tag every single plant and put it into a system known as metric.
[39:08.890 --> 39:09.970]  Uh, then they are tagged.
[39:09.970 --> 39:10.850]  They are accounted for.
[39:10.850 --> 39:13.210]  They're part of your plant count that you're allowed to have.
[39:13.730 --> 39:17.130]  Um, and when a regular walks into a room, they've got a tool that they can
[39:17.130 --> 39:18.490]  just hold up and press a button.
[39:19.170 --> 39:21.250]  And it tells them exactly how many plants are in that room.
[39:21.250 --> 39:21.610]  Yes.
[39:21.610 --> 39:24.330]  Because of the RFID on those plant tags.
[39:24.370 --> 39:26.770]  I mean, everything is tracked down ridiculously.
[39:26.810 --> 39:28.050]  It ridiculously.
[39:28.250 --> 39:31.850]  So as those plants grow, they're, they're now clones in my computer system.
[39:31.850 --> 39:36.050]  If I, when I put them into bigger pots, now they have to be clicked into veg.
[39:36.050 --> 39:39.610]  If I move them to another room, they have to be marked in this little
[39:39.610 --> 39:43.290]  tab on the computer, what room they move into when I move them into flower.
[39:43.450 --> 39:44.410]  I have to move them.
[39:44.770 --> 39:45.970]  I have to change their room.
[39:45.970 --> 39:48.570]  I have to change their status and I have to mark that all of the
[39:48.570 --> 39:50.170]  tags are still the same numbers.
[39:50.530 --> 39:53.290]  Everything stays on camera when it's harvested.
[39:53.490 --> 39:55.210]  All of the tremors are in a room.
[39:55.490 --> 39:56.010]  Guess what?
[39:56.010 --> 39:57.530]  They're all on camera.
[39:57.570 --> 39:59.010]  Everything is done on camera.
[39:59.250 --> 39:59.970]  It's trimmed.
[40:00.250 --> 40:01.970]  The trim is kept in one area.
[40:02.010 --> 40:03.370]  The trash is weighed.
[40:03.410 --> 40:06.490]  All of the trash is weighed before it's thrown away so that we know.
[40:06.690 --> 40:07.570]  And everything is weighed at.
[40:07.810 --> 40:10.330]  I cut down the plant, put it on a scale, hand it to the trimmers.
[40:10.690 --> 40:12.890]  They separate buds and sticks and trim.
[40:13.090 --> 40:14.010]  We weigh the buds.
[40:14.010 --> 40:14.810]  We weigh the trim.
[40:14.810 --> 40:15.610]  We weigh the trash.
[40:15.610 --> 40:16.610]  We throw the trash away.
[40:16.810 --> 40:20.490]  The trash is documented in the marijuana enforcement division
[40:20.490 --> 40:22.090]  computer, which is known as metric.
[40:22.490 --> 40:24.050]  Uh, so everything is on camera.
[40:24.330 --> 40:28.130]  Then it is, uh, put into specific weight packages.
[40:28.330 --> 40:31.410]  The packages are documented in a computer with a tag number on it.
[40:31.450 --> 40:34.170]  That tag again has an RFID code on it.
[40:34.770 --> 40:39.770]  Uh, then they are put into what's called a manifest, a transfer manifest.
[40:40.250 --> 40:44.650]  Then that transfer manifest has the vehicle operators name, driver's
[40:44.690 --> 40:48.530]  license number, license plate number vehicle, make model description.
[40:48.850 --> 40:52.290]  Then you have to type in the exact route that you were traveling, uh,
[40:52.330 --> 40:55.210]  leaving this street, turning left on this street, right onto this
[40:55.210 --> 40:56.930]  street to the destination.
[40:56.930 --> 41:00.170]  Then once you get there, it is unpacked and checked on camera by
[41:00.170 --> 41:01.570]  the dispensary that it's taken to.
[41:01.570 --> 41:03.930]  Then it's put on a shelf all under camera.
[41:03.930 --> 41:05.290]  Then it is sold all under this.
[41:05.730 --> 41:06.010]  Yes.
[41:06.170 --> 41:12.090]  Everything is recorded in covered and there's absolutely no room for leakage.
[41:12.130 --> 41:16.890]  The only time that anything could happen is in a vehicle, but if you're following
[41:16.890 --> 41:20.170]  marijuana enforcement division rules, every package that leaves the growth
[41:20.170 --> 41:26.290]  facility is vacuum sealed in a vacuum bag with a marijuana enforcement division
[41:26.290 --> 41:30.250]  sticker on it that has a specific weight written on it with a strain name on it.
[41:30.610 --> 41:33.930]  And then that is also on a paper that matches that tag number that
[41:33.930 --> 41:35.090]  has the corresponding weight.
[41:36.250 --> 41:39.810]  I can't even tell you how many hundreds of shipments in my day and not one of
[41:39.810 --> 41:41.570]  them was off by anything ever.
[41:41.570 --> 41:41.890]  Right?
[41:41.890 --> 41:42.170]  Yeah.
[41:42.730 --> 41:45.330]  B what you can't, if they're in those vacuum sealed bags and I open it in the
[41:45.330 --> 41:48.530]  car while I'm driving, there's no way for me to seal that razor knife.
[41:49.050 --> 41:49.290]  Yeah.
[41:49.290 --> 41:52.050]  So that's, that's, and that's the only opportunity really.
[41:52.050 --> 41:53.010]  And that's not going to happen.
[41:53.010 --> 41:54.210]  Nobody's going to get away with it.
[41:54.210 --> 41:55.930]  You're going to get caught if you do that stupid shit.
[41:56.050 --> 41:56.210]  Yep.
[41:56.770 --> 42:00.450]  Um, highly, highly, highly, highly regulated is what we're getting at.
[42:00.530 --> 42:00.810]  Yes.
[42:00.810 --> 42:05.690]  So that is the same is now that was one of the three bills they just passed
[42:05.690 --> 42:07.490]  is a seat to sail regulatory system.
[42:07.490 --> 42:08.210]  And it works.
[42:08.290 --> 42:09.090]  It actually works.
[42:09.090 --> 42:09.730]  It works really well.
[42:10.010 --> 42:13.970]  So this, it sounds stringent and it sounds ridiculous, but when we have
[42:13.970 --> 42:16.970]  problems, like we've recently talked about on the show, there've been batches
[42:16.970 --> 42:19.810]  of concentrates that have been made with flowers that were sprayed with
[42:19.810 --> 42:21.250]  pesticides that were not allowed.
[42:21.730 --> 42:23.770]  Since each plant was tracked.
[42:24.090 --> 42:27.890]  And when we apply a pesticide, we write down every tag number that that
[42:27.890 --> 42:33.050]  pesticide is applied to, or a foliar spray or any type of soil track,
[42:33.050 --> 42:34.490]  everything that happens to the plant.
[42:34.530 --> 42:39.570]  So they could see that everything grown in facility number four zero three
[42:39.570 --> 42:43.930]  extracted by extraction company four zero two, and there's be dashes at the
[42:43.930 --> 42:48.570]  end of those, everything from that batch was contaminated at plant tag number
[42:48.570 --> 42:51.290]  1,006, five, five, five through 1000.
[42:51.330 --> 42:51.410]  Yeah.
[42:51.410 --> 42:53.610]  The state just releases a list.
[42:53.650 --> 42:56.450]  Retailers check the serial numbers on their, their product.
[42:56.490 --> 43:00.170]  And you know, instantly if you're carrying some tainted product,
[43:00.170 --> 43:04.210]  if it's cannabis or hash or edibles or topicals, you can pull
[43:04.370 --> 43:05.810]  all of that off the shelf safely.
[43:05.810 --> 43:06.370]  Colorado.
[43:06.370 --> 43:10.210]  You can follow all of it from origin to, to retail and back.
[43:10.250 --> 43:13.530]  So it's absolutely helpful, even though it seems really, when you're
[43:13.530 --> 43:15.010]  doing it, it seems obnoxious.
[43:15.570 --> 43:20.010]  But you know, once it took me a couple of months of working with, but after like a
[43:20.010 --> 43:23.130]  month or two of doing metric every single day, I was like, oh, this is easy.
[43:23.250 --> 43:24.090]  It's just what you do.
[43:24.090 --> 43:25.570]  It becomes part of your routine.
[43:26.130 --> 43:28.170]  You just treat your work day like chess moves.
[43:28.290 --> 43:28.610]  Yeah.
[43:28.770 --> 43:30.770]  And as soon as you accept that you're good to go.
[43:30.770 --> 43:34.810]  Well, I would make notes on a little piece of paper of things that I needed
[43:34.810 --> 43:36.130]  to do in metric as I did it.
[43:36.130 --> 43:38.930]  And then I would go to the office and just catch up metric right before lunch
[43:38.930 --> 43:41.610]  and then go back and catch up metric right before I leave at the end of the day.
[43:41.970 --> 43:44.370]  Or when it got down to cutting clones and doing things that
[43:44.370 --> 43:46.010]  needed a lot of metric attention.
[43:46.410 --> 43:49.690]  Uh, I had a little cart and I would just take my Mac book to work and sign
[43:49.690 --> 43:51.370]  into metric right there and just do it on the card.
[43:51.370 --> 43:53.450]  It was, it was second nature by the time I was done there.
[43:53.850 --> 43:56.210]  So the seed to sale system is definitely helpful.
[43:56.210 --> 43:57.210]  I think it's going to work.
[43:57.330 --> 43:59.810]  I'm going to continue with the email because this is going to be a long damn
[43:59.810 --> 44:00.370]  podcast.
[44:00.410 --> 44:05.090]  If I don't, uh, he said, Michigan, we, uh, passed three bills pushing us into a
[44:05.090 --> 44:07.010]  seed to sale system based on Colorado system.
[44:07.370 --> 44:10.810]  I was wondering if you and white Mike could touch on the subject.
[44:11.090 --> 44:15.650]  Like how do I go about finding out information from the city about how
[44:15.650 --> 44:18.130]  many licensed facilities they will allow?
[44:18.170 --> 44:22.250]  And then he also says, what's the biggest hurdle going from a basement grow to a
[44:22.250 --> 44:24.210]  warehouse, which I think is more directed at me.
[44:24.570 --> 44:27.650]  Then he continues to say, I know you have recently made the switch from soil to
[44:27.650 --> 44:29.930]  cocoa and any advice on that transition.
[44:30.210 --> 44:34.130]  I am planning on running veg bloom and I'm already in a basement, but do you add
[44:34.130 --> 44:36.330]  anything else to the line as well?
[44:36.570 --> 44:40.250]  What are some things you didn't expect going to such a large scale and any other
[44:40.250 --> 44:44.850]  advice you may think one would need to know about taking a leap into the big
[44:44.850 --> 44:46.810]  leagues? Thanks again for such a great podcast.
[44:46.810 --> 44:51.810]  I hope you can answer some questions for me and other,
[44:51.890 --> 44:53.730]  um, other questions, others.
[44:53.730 --> 44:56.810]  I'm not sure how you want it in that, but yes, we'll answer your question, bro.
[44:57.090 --> 45:00.010]  Um, I'll let Mike go with the first part cause I've got a lot of stuff to say.
[45:00.250 --> 45:02.690]  First of all, lawyer up. If you're going to get into the cannabis industry,
[45:03.210 --> 45:05.690]  lawyer, lawyer up, get,
[45:05.730 --> 45:08.490]  get a lawyer and then get another lawyer to make sure that that lawyer is not
[45:08.490 --> 45:11.170]  fucking with you. And then get a lawyer to keep an eye on your accountant.
[45:11.210 --> 45:13.690]  Get to your lawyers and an accountant to make sure they're all fucking keeping
[45:13.690 --> 45:16.370]  an eye on each other. That's, that's my first bit of advice.
[45:16.890 --> 45:20.330]  That should really be like the first half of like every business school,
[45:20.330 --> 45:22.770]  one-on-one class. Yes. Uh, yeah.
[45:22.770 --> 45:25.290]  Make sure you're a lawyer and don't let them be too good of friends. Make,
[45:25.330 --> 45:27.970]  hopefully your lawyer and your accountant don't seem like they like each other
[45:27.970 --> 45:29.930]  cause then they can't team up on you. They don't,
[45:29.930 --> 45:32.570]  you don't want them embezzling from you. Just keep them watching each other.
[45:32.610 --> 45:34.610]  I think he's stealing from you. I think he's stealing from you.
[45:34.610 --> 45:38.570]  Just keep them like that. Keep them watching. So Mike, the first question,
[45:39.410 --> 45:43.250]  how do we go about finding out information from the city about how many licensed
[45:43.250 --> 45:47.370]  facilities they will allow? Um, before we, uh,
[45:47.410 --> 45:49.730]  before we hit record, we, uh, I jumped online,
[45:49.730 --> 45:54.170]  we jumped online and checked out some of the stuff about your law. Um,
[45:54.170 --> 45:58.930]  in Michigan, um, local control is part of it. And so, um,
[45:58.970 --> 46:03.970]  and this is from the cannabis surprise, surprise reported here in Colorado. Um,
[46:04.010 --> 46:06.410]  but according to the cannabis, um,
[46:06.410 --> 46:11.330]  the local control part in Michigan's law is growers, processors, shippers,
[46:11.330 --> 46:15.810]  testing facilities, and dis uh, dispensaries, um,
[46:16.970 --> 46:21.370]  could not obtain a state license unless their local government adopts an
[46:21.410 --> 46:22.850]  authorizing ordinance.
[46:23.290 --> 46:27.490]  Municipalities could cap the number of licenses within their borders and assess
[46:27.510 --> 46:30.050]  no more than a $5,000 fee per license.
[46:30.490 --> 46:34.130]  A state board would charge application and renewal fees to cover costs,
[46:34.130 --> 46:36.690]  including for substance abuse programs and law enforcement.
[46:37.170 --> 46:41.690]  And so basically what that means is you're going to need two licenses to open
[46:41.690 --> 46:43.850]  any sort of marijuana business in Michigan.
[46:43.890 --> 46:46.730]  And now we're talking about medical marijuana businesses here.
[46:46.770 --> 46:51.290]  Recreational is not quite legal in Michigan yet. I don't think. Um,
[46:52.370 --> 46:53.490]  so, uh,
[46:53.530 --> 46:58.450]  if your local area does not create some sort of licensing process for these
[46:58.450 --> 47:02.090]  businesses, you can't get a state license to operate in that area.
[47:02.490 --> 47:07.410]  So how do you find out what those rules are in your area? Um,
[47:08.170 --> 47:13.170]  the first step is head to your local planning and zoning. Um,
[47:13.290 --> 47:18.090]  hop online, uh, spend a few seconds with Google, um, figure out,
[47:18.290 --> 47:22.530]  um, where you're planning the zoning department is. And, uh,
[47:22.650 --> 47:25.450]  while you're there, you're going to want to look up city council or County
[47:25.450 --> 47:27.010]  commissioner, um,
[47:27.010 --> 47:32.010]  whichever sort of governing body decides the land use rules, um,
[47:32.050 --> 47:36.610]  for your area. For example, here in Pueblo, Colorado, uh, in the city,
[47:36.610 --> 47:39.130]  we have a city council who makes those decisions.
[47:39.530 --> 47:43.090]  And then in the County of Pueblo, we have a board of County commissioners.
[47:43.450 --> 47:47.850]  These people are totally separate and have totally different rules for marijuana
[47:47.850 --> 47:50.850]  businesses because they're totally separate governmental entities.
[47:51.250 --> 47:53.250]  I assume it's very similar in Michigan.
[47:53.530 --> 47:58.410]  So first step is figure out which municipality city County,
[47:58.410 --> 48:02.170]  whatever you want to have your marijuana businesses in, um,
[48:02.210 --> 48:06.170]  head down to planning and zoning or city council or whatever. Um,
[48:06.210 --> 48:11.170]  and ask is, is your first step. And because this is brand new, um,
[48:11.570 --> 48:14.770]  you're likely to get, to be met with a confused look,
[48:14.790 --> 48:17.490]  which means you've got some work ahead of you. Um,
[48:17.490 --> 48:22.490]  if you're lucky the area you're in has favorable government officials who saw
[48:23.290 --> 48:28.290]  this coming and have already crafted some sort of land use code,
[48:29.090 --> 48:31.370]  um, specifying, uh,
[48:31.370 --> 48:35.650]  which zoning designations the property for these businesses have to carry,
[48:36.770 --> 48:41.610]  um, distances from schools, libraries, churches, those kinds of rules. Um,
[48:41.610 --> 48:43.450]  if they haven't gotten that far yet,
[48:43.450 --> 48:47.570]  you're looking at a year or more of public hearings while these rules get hashed
[48:47.570 --> 48:52.130]  out. Um, so like I said, you've got some work ahead of you. Um,
[48:52.170 --> 48:56.490]  this is where I sort of got my activist credentials in Pueblo was helping Pueblo
[48:56.490 --> 48:58.850]  do all of this. Um,
[48:59.330 --> 49:03.370]  so when you've checked with planning and zoning to see a,
[49:03.370 --> 49:07.210]  if your area has these rules yet, and if not how they're being created,
[49:07.570 --> 49:11.890]  the next thing to do is get yourself involved in that conversation. Um,
[49:11.890 --> 49:16.690]  it's really easy to do, uh, especially as these rules are being crafted.
[49:17.130 --> 49:17.610]  Um,
[49:17.610 --> 49:21.450]  whatever governmental agencies crafting this rules will take a lot of public
[49:21.450 --> 49:25.650]  comment to get the community's input, how far they want them from schools,
[49:25.650 --> 49:28.810]  how high the licensing fee should be. Um,
[49:28.850 --> 49:32.330]  if they want to add any sort of other rules and regulations, for example,
[49:32.330 --> 49:36.050]  there's an area in Colorado that requires marijuana businesses to be a hundred
[49:36.050 --> 49:40.290]  percent energy neutral, um, which means they can't consume electricity.
[49:40.290 --> 49:42.370]  They don't also generate, um,
[49:42.410 --> 49:45.370]  wrap your head around that one in a County that doesn't allow outdoor growing.
[49:46.170 --> 49:50.250]  Um, but get involved with these in this conversation now,
[49:50.250 --> 49:54.090]  and that way you can help nudge or guide,
[49:54.610 --> 49:58.850]  um, the regulators as they write the rules for your area.
[49:59.370 --> 50:00.210]  Um,
[50:01.850 --> 50:06.210]  if you're smart, you'll help them steer clear of business number caps,
[50:06.930 --> 50:09.450]  um, and things like that. That's really, really,
[50:09.450 --> 50:10.810]  really bad for business.
[50:10.970 --> 50:12.290]  That just creates monopolies, right?
[50:12.570 --> 50:15.570]  It immediately creates a monopoly. Um,
[50:15.570 --> 50:20.570]  it forces the local municipality to do a bunch of obnoxious things like
[50:20.890 --> 50:25.890]  having a license lottery and some sort of review process for applicants. Um,
[50:25.970 --> 50:29.450]  that's additionally unnecessary. Um, I mean,
[50:29.490 --> 50:33.610]  it creates a real legislative and practical nightmare for the,
[50:33.930 --> 50:37.930]  the government agency trying to do it. Um, and yet in Colorado,
[50:37.930 --> 50:42.170]  they continue to do it all over and over and over again. Um,
[50:42.210 --> 50:46.250]  but just get involved with this conversation now and, uh, with,
[50:46.370 --> 50:47.970]  in all likelihood, um,
[50:48.810 --> 50:52.850]  you'll be able to steer whatever local government agency that's writing these
[50:52.870 --> 50:57.490]  rules into crafting smart rules for your agencies so that you're not looking at
[50:57.490 --> 50:59.250]  huge licensing fees. I like that.
[50:59.250 --> 51:02.930]  They have a cap in the state rules at five grand. Um,
[51:03.010 --> 51:07.330]  I've seen it as high as 50 here in counties and cities. Um,
[51:07.330 --> 51:11.010]  the state only charges five or seven or 10 depending on the size of your
[51:11.010 --> 51:13.730]  license. Um, but I've seen individual counties charge much,
[51:13.730 --> 51:14.570]  much more than that.
[51:16.490 --> 51:20.450]  So he's going to need a ton of money, a lawyer, an accountant. Now you said,
[51:20.450 --> 51:22.850]  planning and zoning and city council.
[51:23.010 --> 51:26.690]  Should he also join forces with his local marijuana activist groups?
[51:26.730 --> 51:29.330]  That that depends on the climate in your area.
[51:29.330 --> 51:33.090]  If you go down to planning and zoning and are greeted by a really friendly
[51:33.090 --> 51:37.250]  person who hands you a printout of the rules they've already crafted and all
[51:37.250 --> 51:40.210]  you have to do is fill out the application and find a piece of property that's
[51:40.210 --> 51:44.290]  zoned appropriately and get a rental agreement. Um, well congrats bro.
[51:44.330 --> 51:46.890]  You live in a really enlightened area. Um,
[51:46.930 --> 51:51.530]  but what's likely to happen is you're going to be met with a confused look. Um,
[51:51.610 --> 51:56.010]  and they're only going to just be creating these rules now. Um,
[51:56.050 --> 51:57.610]  and so if that's the case,
[51:57.610 --> 52:02.250]  your best bet is to start attending, um, county meetings,
[52:02.650 --> 52:07.130]  uh, zoning meetings, just watching how those meetings take place. Um,
[52:07.370 --> 52:09.730]  getting a feel for the people in charge of those meetings,
[52:09.730 --> 52:10.890]  who's on your city council,
[52:10.890 --> 52:13.890]  who's on your board of county commissioners or your zoning board,
[52:14.210 --> 52:18.210]  what are they like and dislike? Um, and I'm basically,
[52:18.210 --> 52:21.690]  it just takes a lot of sitting and watching. Um, I mean,
[52:21.930 --> 52:26.170]  watching laws get made is incredibly boring, but, uh, um,
[52:26.210 --> 52:28.250]  they're legalizing marijuana across the country.
[52:28.250 --> 52:32.490]  We have to write all those laws. Um, if you don't want really,
[52:32.490 --> 52:35.570]  really messed up laws written by people who don't understand what we're doing
[52:35.570 --> 52:39.770]  and what we're working with, um, stand back and wait for somebody else to do it.
[52:39.810 --> 52:42.610]  I mean, some of the rules that were proposed here in Colorado during this
[52:42.610 --> 52:44.850]  process were asinine. Um,
[52:44.890 --> 52:49.170]  and it took a while for people like myself to explain to legislatures
[52:49.530 --> 52:54.210]  why it was asinine. Um, because on face value,
[52:54.210 --> 52:57.930]  a lot of them seemed like a good idea, but when you take it into practice,
[52:57.930 --> 53:01.410]  like the last episode, we talked about edibles labeling. Um,
[53:01.450 --> 53:03.210]  they were ready to get rid of all drinks.
[53:03.890 --> 53:07.370]  Just we'll get rid of them period. It's never been a problem anywhere,
[53:07.370 --> 53:12.050]  but we're going to cut out a massive section of the edibles industry.
[53:12.730 --> 53:14.730]  Um, just for no reason at all.
[53:14.850 --> 53:18.450]  The people that are making these rules are not consumers. They are not producers.
[53:18.450 --> 53:19.370]  They're just people.
[53:19.370 --> 53:22.210]  There are a lot of times they don't know anything about it. Their base,
[53:22.250 --> 53:25.690]  their background is in like finance and they were a dentist for 20 years or some
[53:25.690 --> 53:29.970]  shit. Um, they don't know anything about mass production of cannabis,
[53:29.970 --> 53:32.130]  retail rules, um,
[53:32.130 --> 53:36.610]  what those rules might be for alcohol and tobacco retailers. Um,
[53:36.770 --> 53:40.930]  why little tweaks to those rules are appropriate for cannabis. I mean,
[53:40.930 --> 53:43.570]  getting them to understand all that can be quite a bit of work.
[53:44.730 --> 53:46.490]  And they're probably got some fear in them also.
[53:46.930 --> 53:50.130]  Well, yeah, they've, you have to go into this,
[53:50.130 --> 53:54.530]  knowing that most of the people you talk to, um, were the hall monitor,
[53:56.050 --> 53:57.690]  um, not to be a dick about it, but that's,
[53:58.050 --> 54:00.730]  when you start going to city government meetings, you're like,
[54:00.770 --> 54:04.450]  that's what happened to all those people from high school. Um,
[54:04.490 --> 54:06.930]  they just disappeared from my world after graduate.
[54:06.970 --> 54:09.930]  They got jobs in city government. That's where they all went. Yep.
[54:10.890 --> 54:11.970]  Jeff went on tour.
[54:11.970 --> 54:15.970]  All these people got jobs at their local zoning department and have worked their
[54:15.970 --> 54:19.450]  way through the ranks of city bureaucracy for 20 years.
[54:19.810 --> 54:22.170]  Those are the people you're dealing with and they're not bad people.
[54:22.170 --> 54:26.490]  Most of them are wonderful, but they don't really know anything about marijuana.
[54:26.530 --> 54:29.730]  They don't know why we consume it. They don't know why it's fun at concerts.
[54:29.730 --> 54:33.730]  They just know it gives them a headache when they go see popular music. Um,
[54:33.730 --> 54:35.570]  and that's really the extent of their education.
[54:35.570 --> 54:38.530]  So getting them to understand that, um,
[54:38.570 --> 54:42.970]  moving all marijuana production indoors is incredibly bad for the environment.
[54:44.130 --> 54:47.690]  Um, when, especially when cannabis can be grown, um,
[54:47.730 --> 54:50.370]  so effectively outdoors, um,
[54:51.610 --> 54:55.770]  that conversation, we fail that having a lot of places in Colorado, um,
[54:55.810 --> 54:59.130]  which is why Pueblo County is so popular with production facilities right now.
[54:59.210 --> 55:00.050]  We're loaded.
[55:00.170 --> 55:04.610]  Yep. We're one of the few places you can grow outdoors and we're one of the few
[55:04.610 --> 55:08.650]  places you can grow in greenhouses and we're one of the few places where land
[55:08.650 --> 55:11.890]  isn't ridiculously expensive. I mean, we've got the trifecta down here,
[55:11.890 --> 55:14.290]  and that's why we have so many companies locating.
[55:14.330 --> 55:17.330]  And it's changing the whole landscape here.
[55:17.330 --> 55:18.650]  You can tell that there's some money here.
[55:18.650 --> 55:20.130]  Now we didn't have any money here before,
[55:20.130 --> 55:23.490]  and you can tell that there's actually some future for this place. Um,
[55:24.210 --> 55:29.210]  had our County commissioners followed suit with Denver and
[55:29.210 --> 55:34.130]  Aurora and Boulder and Longmont and Lakewood and banned outdoor growing
[55:34.130 --> 55:38.250]  band greenhouse, growing, pushed it all indoors. Um,
[55:38.410 --> 55:42.170]  the economic recovery we have enjoyed has been very, uh,
[55:42.170 --> 55:46.970]  or would have been very different. Um, and so in Michigan, I know you guys,
[55:47.010 --> 55:51.650]  um, have been taking economic hit after economic hit for the last,
[55:52.410 --> 55:55.170]  my whole life. Sorry. Um,
[55:57.250 --> 56:01.250]  this can really be an economic, um, engine for,
[56:01.290 --> 56:03.010]  for growth and prosperity.
[56:03.330 --> 56:08.010]  And it's not a tidal wave of money that's going to fix everything.
[56:08.610 --> 56:11.170]  Um, I watched the video on Detroit not too long ago,
[56:11.170 --> 56:16.170]  where people were disassembling skyscrapers and selling parts of scrap. Um,
[56:16.610 --> 56:17.250]  I mean,
[56:17.250 --> 56:20.450]  like active skyscrapers or old skyscrapers, like old ones. Okay.
[56:20.490 --> 56:21.850]  As long as there's still people in them,
[56:22.370 --> 56:25.530]  the amount of recession in Detroit is,
[56:25.690 --> 56:28.730]  is significantly different than what we see here. Even it,
[56:29.170 --> 56:33.730]  even though we've got Pueblo and Detroit have gone through similar things. Um,
[56:33.770 --> 56:36.610]  the scale is very different. Um,
[56:39.010 --> 56:40.370]  in a state like Michigan,
[56:40.370 --> 56:44.810]  marijuana really could be two or three, uh,
[56:44.850 --> 56:48.610]  or 20 or 30,000 jobs. Oh yeah. It could bring it back. Um,
[56:48.610 --> 56:52.690]  now these people aren't all going to be making 75,000 a year. Um,
[56:52.730 --> 56:56.290]  a lot of them are going to be making 10, 50 an hour, 12, 50 an hour,
[56:56.290 --> 56:58.770]  14 an hour. Um,
[56:59.970 --> 57:01.970]  but that's still thousands of jobs.
[57:02.250 --> 57:07.050]  You're still talking about hundreds of millions of dollars into improving
[57:07.050 --> 57:10.970]  properties and bringing them up to code. And when Jeff starts talking about is
[57:10.970 --> 57:15.410]  what, what do you need to know going from greenhouse to warehouse? Um,
[57:15.410 --> 57:19.250]  the improvements that are required in a lot of the warehouses to get them up to
[57:19.570 --> 57:22.610]  where he's going to get at that costs a lot of money.
[57:22.610 --> 57:25.290]  And that improvement is massive for the area.
[57:25.410 --> 57:27.570]  We had a, uh, excuse me,
[57:27.570 --> 57:30.810]  we needed to upgrade our airflow system a little bit at green and healthy.
[57:30.810 --> 57:33.570]  And I was getting some estimates. We're trying to connect two rooms,
[57:33.570 --> 57:36.450]  two sides of a building and just run it through one air conditioning thing and
[57:36.450 --> 57:39.570]  handle some humidity and some air control through one thing. Then he goes, Oh
[57:39.570 --> 57:42.570]  yeah, probably six to 8,000 each side to make that happen.
[57:42.930 --> 57:45.170]  It just for a small air exchange set up.
[57:45.450 --> 57:50.050]  So just it's going from the home to the commercial that when he said 8,000 each
[57:50.050 --> 57:52.810]  side, I was like, Oh, this is going to take a second.
[57:53.370 --> 57:54.210]  Um,
[57:55.130 --> 57:57.450]  just the economic boom,
[57:57.930 --> 58:02.850]  a state can feel if this is done correctly, if it's done smartly, um,
[58:03.130 --> 58:04.450]  and, and to, to have,
[58:04.490 --> 58:09.490]  have it done correctly really takes people willing to do the leg work,
[58:09.530 --> 58:11.890]  to go to city council meetings,
[58:11.890 --> 58:16.650]  to go to state legislature meetings and make sure that they don't do thousand
[58:16.650 --> 58:20.850]  foot from everywhere rules. Um, I remember here in Pueblo, the,
[58:21.050 --> 58:24.130]  the first proposal I saw for, for buffer zones,
[58:24.370 --> 58:27.370]  the distance your marijuana business has to be from other stuff.
[58:27.690 --> 58:31.330]  There were like 25 different businesses on there. Yeah. Like nursing homes,
[58:31.330 --> 58:35.130]  right. Um, all kinds of different schools, churches, liquor stores, pharmacies,
[58:36.090 --> 58:37.090]  business name,
[58:37.890 --> 58:42.890]  specifically seek out adults with developmental disabilities,
[58:43.730 --> 58:47.010]  um, as employees. They,
[58:47.690 --> 58:51.890]  that's that company's kind of niche is giving that whole segment of the
[58:51.890 --> 58:54.610]  population a great job. Um,
[58:54.810 --> 58:59.410]  and our original legislation had a thousand feet from their property.
[59:00.130 --> 59:02.570]  Um, and then in the middle of all of this,
[59:02.570 --> 59:05.970]  Colorado redefined what a thousand feet from a school meant.
[59:06.450 --> 59:10.970]  They changed how it's measured halfway in through the game. Um,
[59:11.050 --> 59:14.530]  and it wasn't like feet to inches kind of distance,
[59:14.530 --> 59:19.410]  but it was what they call as the crow flies, um, versus walking.
[59:19.890 --> 59:24.410]  And so originally dispensary owners walked out their front door and took the
[59:24.410 --> 59:29.410]  street on foot version to the nearest school and then applied that way saying
[59:30.130 --> 59:32.570]  that they were a thousand 300 feet from a school.
[59:32.890 --> 59:36.330]  And then they changed the rule to ask the clove crow flies.
[59:36.330 --> 59:41.330]  And it turns out the nearest pieces of their property lines are only 600 feet
[59:42.490 --> 59:44.130]  apart because of math.
[59:44.450 --> 59:49.010]  That was literally the only mass shutdown of businesses we had in Colorado is
[59:49.030 --> 59:53.690]  because that rule changed. Um, and so, I mean,
[59:53.690 --> 59:57.410]  I mean for you, I, when Jeff first told me this was a question, I was like, dude,
[59:57.410 --> 01:00:00.090]  that's a whole podcast. Um, we can't do that as,
[01:00:00.090 --> 01:00:04.690]  as part of a thing because, um, where your state is right now.
[01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:09.730]  And honestly, this applies to like 14 different States across the country,
[01:00:09.930 --> 01:00:13.130]  depending on what happens in November's election. Um,
[01:00:13.170 --> 01:00:15.970]  14 different States will be going through the process we're talking about right
[01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:19.810]  now, um, or are about to be depending on how the election goes.
[01:00:20.170 --> 01:00:23.130]  So a lot of you need to start thinking about this,
[01:00:23.170 --> 01:00:26.210]  who makes these decisions in your area? Um,
[01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:29.490]  what kind of processes that, what does it look like?
[01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:30.850]  How do I get involved in that?
[01:00:31.090 --> 01:00:33.690]  And if you don't make those decisions and start writing those rules,
[01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:35.010]  somebody will write them for you.
[01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:39.370]  Yep. Um, and unfortunately for you, um,
[01:00:39.730 --> 01:00:42.210]  this wasn't as bad when Colorado was doing this.
[01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:46.890]  The anti-pop movement is very vocal now.
[01:00:47.490 --> 01:00:48.330]  Um,
[01:00:48.410 --> 01:00:53.410]  it was just the DEA and the police and law enforcement in the prisons and police
[01:00:53.690 --> 01:00:56.050]  unions when Colorado was doing this.
[01:00:56.370 --> 01:01:00.890]  Now there are parents groups were freaked out. And when you get into this,
[01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:03.890]  mainly you'll find that the anti-pot groups are just people who didn't have
[01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:07.090]  anything in their world that needed to something. Um,
[01:01:07.170 --> 01:01:09.770]  and trying to remind us all that in eighth grade,
[01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:13.530]  we learned that pot is bad has become their goal in life. Right. Um,
[01:01:13.610 --> 01:01:16.130]  and they're not
[01:01:17.890 --> 01:01:20.330]  very good at research or arguments.
[01:01:20.330 --> 01:01:22.930]  We just got a mailer or a flyer in the mail.
[01:01:26.290 --> 01:01:31.290]  But the one thing they, they really, really are is vocal.
[01:01:31.770 --> 01:01:35.610]  Yes. And when you do get involved in this process in your area,
[01:01:35.610 --> 01:01:39.370]  one of the first things you're going to realize is that the old dude who shows
[01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:42.410]  up to every meeting and won't shut up about whatever their topic is,
[01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:47.730]  everybody that's involved in city government knows that topic intimately.
[01:01:47.730 --> 01:01:49.250]  They know every in and out of it.
[01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:52.250]  And they're sick of hearing about it for one reason,
[01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:54.850]  because that dude shows up and makes a lot of noise.
[01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:57.050]  And that's what the anti-pot people do.
[01:01:57.290 --> 01:02:00.010]  They'll rally 35 or 40 church moms.
[01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:04.410]  They'll show up in force to two or three hearings. And all of a sudden,
[01:02:04.410 --> 01:02:09.250]  your city doesn't get to enjoy any of the economic benefits of legalization.
[01:02:09.530 --> 01:02:14.010]  And every marijuana consumer in that geographic area that wants to participate
[01:02:14.010 --> 01:02:17.410]  in the legal market has to drive to the next County to do so.
[01:02:18.570 --> 01:02:23.090]  Um, because of who showed up at a meeting, um, you really,
[01:02:23.090 --> 01:02:25.290]  really, really need to start taking a look at this,
[01:02:25.290 --> 01:02:29.090]  especially if you want to be part of the industry as an owner. Um,
[01:02:29.110 --> 01:02:31.970]  you've got a chance to get in on the ground floor right now,
[01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:35.250]  if you're willing to put in serious legislative legwork.
[01:02:37.970 --> 01:02:39.330]  That's my half of the question.
[01:02:40.850 --> 01:02:43.450]  I just glanced over a second. I was like, we're in an hour and two minutes.
[01:02:43.450 --> 01:02:46.170]  I'm almost tempted to make this a two part question and, uh,
[01:02:46.170 --> 01:02:48.210]  cut this dude off now and make another episode out of this.
[01:02:49.050 --> 01:02:53.730]  Your half of the question is huge because there's a lot of stuff. I mean,
[01:02:53.730 --> 01:02:55.690]  we can give them the glance over if you want.
[01:02:55.930 --> 01:02:58.370]  No, I think we would, uh, there's enough. I mean,
[01:02:58.370 --> 01:03:01.370]  he asked like four questions in here. So I think we're going to make this a two
[01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:03.370]  parter. Are you down to record a little bit more with me?
[01:03:03.450 --> 01:03:05.690]  I totally am. And I could use like a two minute break.
[01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:07.690]  I knew you needed a stretch break, a cigarette break.
[01:03:07.690 --> 01:03:10.410]  I could use a fresh drink and a couple of dabs. So ladies and gentlemen,
[01:03:10.410 --> 01:03:15.370]  six minutes podcast is, yeah, this podcast has gone just over an hour.
[01:03:15.610 --> 01:03:17.930]  Uh, I would rather record two episodes out of this.
[01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:20.730]  So Mike and I are going to take some dabs. Let's do this.
[01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:22.210]  If you have more questions for your listeners,
[01:03:22.210 --> 01:03:23.410]  cause we kind of do this on the fly.
[01:03:23.410 --> 01:03:25.890]  Can I twist your arm and make this a Thursday episode or a Wednesday?
[01:03:26.090 --> 01:03:27.690]  That's what's going to happen. We're going to put these out.
[01:03:27.690 --> 01:03:29.410]  One is going to be a Monday. One's going to be a Thursday.
[01:03:29.410 --> 01:03:32.490]  So that was, I don't know if this is, for me,
[01:03:32.490 --> 01:03:35.450]  this is more than interesting enough to do a week teaser.
[01:03:35.450 --> 01:03:37.370]  And I think our listeners are that dedicated,
[01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:40.010]  but I want to hook them up and do it closer. If we can.
[01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:43.250]  This is I've been trying a lot of times I try to do two episodes a week,
[01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:45.970]  but I can't commit to that. I can't dedicate to that.
[01:03:45.970 --> 01:03:46.890]  So I haven't made the promise.
[01:03:47.850 --> 01:03:51.210]  We have trouble getting one of these together a month now just cause we're both
[01:03:51.210 --> 01:03:51.850]  busy adults.
[01:03:51.850 --> 01:03:52.130]  Right.
[01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:54.930]  But we're going to make sure that these two episodes come out on a Monday and a
[01:03:54.930 --> 01:03:57.090]  Thursday back to back quick like that. You guys,
[01:03:57.170 --> 01:04:00.250]  if you like this content that comes from listeners and listener generated

[01:04:02.690 --> 01:04:05.490]  I would love to hear from you. Um, I'm going to wrap it up quickly.
[01:04:05.490 --> 01:04:09.250]  Make sure you follow Mike on social media. It's Nemo punk 15 on Twitter. Uh,

[01:04:15.090 --> 01:04:17.170]  I think that's all we're going to do for this week.
[01:04:17.170 --> 01:04:19.810]  Mike sneaking away to go use the men's room. He's going to grab a cigarette.
[01:04:19.810 --> 01:04:21.850]  I'm going to take some dabs and then we're going to record another episode.
[01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:23.890]  So ladies and gentlemen, until next time,
[01:04:23.930 --> 01:04:26.450]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:17.560]  Well, if we did them come here and knock us, I go suck us.
[01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:20.560]  Then me put another fire upon them fuss fuss.
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:23.560]  You understand what I'm saying? Well, now I'm off us.
[01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:29.560]  Signs of the kind are plain to see.
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:35.560]  They reap in the fruit of their vanity.
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:40.560]  Mark us, we teach them. Know the price, we reach them.
[01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:43.560]  To live for the fire.
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:48.560]  The fire is burning.
[01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:51.560]  The fire is burning.
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:54.560]  The fire is burning.
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:57.560]  And the children will be burning.
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:59.560]  The fire is burning.
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:02.560]  The fire is burning.
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:10.670]  The fire is burning.
[01:06:10.670 --> 01:06:14.670]  Fire furnace from the north to the south and the east and the west.
[01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:16.670]  Me yell King Salas and I ask the ask.

[01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:27.670]  Babylon the fire is burning.
[01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:30.670]  Burning.
[01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:41.040]  All the innocent life you led astray.
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:47.040]  For all those shattered dreams that never came true.
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:52.040]  Babylon am banking those fingers weak.

[01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:12.820]  Babylon the fire is burning.
[01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:45.700]  The fire is burning
[01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:52.560]  And the fire is burning
