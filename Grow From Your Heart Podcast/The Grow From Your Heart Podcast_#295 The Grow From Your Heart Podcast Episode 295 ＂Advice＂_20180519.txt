[00:28.120 --> 00:30.540]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:30.540 --> 00:31.820]  if you're a cannabis activist
[00:31.820 --> 00:33.380]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:33.380 --> 00:35.180]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:35.180 --> 00:38.220]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:38.220 --> 00:40.180]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:40.180 --> 00:42.180]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:42.180 --> 00:44.500]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:44.500 --> 00:46.060]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:46.060 --> 00:48.460]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.

[00:56.220 --> 00:57.340]  is brought to you by my friends
[00:57.340 --> 00:59.300]  at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:59.300 --> 01:01.200]  That's right, if you need new genetics in your garden,
[01:01.200 --> 01:04.020]  I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company.

[01:07.460 --> 01:10.980]  The Hella Dank Seed Company will be running a 420 sale.

[01:21.180 --> 01:22.380]  for all the information.
[01:24.100 --> 01:25.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, I like to start these episodes
[01:25.700 --> 01:28.020]  by letting you know what I am smoking today.
[01:28.020 --> 01:29.920]  I took a little container and I threw some
[01:29.920 --> 01:32.860]  of the Lemon OG Live Resin in there,
[01:32.860 --> 01:34.860]  and then I topped it off with some Lemon Jeffrey
[01:34.860 --> 01:37.300]  High Terpene Full Spectrum Extract,
[01:37.300 --> 01:39.620]  and I took way too big of a dab,
[01:39.620 --> 01:41.700]  kinda burned my nose and made my eyes water a little bit,
[01:41.700 --> 01:43.220]  and it made my head spin around.
[01:44.060 --> 01:46.100]  I had to go sit on the couch and reconfigure my life,
[01:46.100 --> 01:47.820]  but after I learned how to walk and talk again,
[01:47.820 --> 01:49.580]  everything was great, and now we're doing a podcast,
[01:49.580 --> 01:50.500]  so thanks for joining me.
[01:50.500 --> 01:52.340]  Big shout out to my friends at the Garden of Whedon
[01:52.340 --> 01:55.020]  for the amazing Lemon OG Live Resin,
[01:55.020 --> 01:57.460]  and of course, shout out to my friends at Apothecary
[01:57.460 --> 02:00.540]  for the Lemon Jeffrey High Terpene Full Spectrum Extract.
[02:00.540 --> 02:01.940]  You guys, when I talk about the High Terpene
[02:01.940 --> 02:04.560]  Full Spectrum Extract, people say, what the hell is that?
[02:04.560 --> 02:07.220]  It is, it's mostly terpenes.
[02:07.220 --> 02:11.180]  It is 90-something percent, it is about 95% terpenes.
[02:11.180 --> 02:15.020]  They took Lemon Jeffrey flowers and extracted it.
[02:15.020 --> 02:17.300]  I do not know the exact extraction method,
[02:17.300 --> 02:19.020]  I don't wanna act like I know,
[02:19.020 --> 02:21.260]  but they make High Terpene and High Cannabinoid
[02:21.260 --> 02:23.580]  Full Spectrum Extract, it's a separation.
[02:23.580 --> 02:25.460]  The terpenes are liquid.
[02:25.460 --> 02:29.140]  It is the aroma and flavor put into a liquid form
[02:29.140 --> 02:31.340]  in a small vial, and I take a little bit of that
[02:31.340 --> 02:33.060]  and I mix it in with my other concentrates,
[02:33.060 --> 02:34.900]  and it makes it taste amazing.
[02:34.900 --> 02:36.700]  It enhances the lemon flavor,
[02:36.700 --> 02:38.420]  it brings out the lemon flavor.
[02:38.420 --> 02:40.020]  There's something in the Lemon Jeffrey terps
[02:40.020 --> 02:41.780]  that do a really good thing to my brain.
[02:41.780 --> 02:44.060]  I've got a traumatic brain injury.
[02:44.060 --> 02:46.820]  Sometimes I get what I call glitches or skips
[02:46.820 --> 02:48.740]  to where my brain just, seems like the thoughts
[02:48.740 --> 02:51.140]  just won't connect as easily as they normally should.
[02:51.140 --> 02:54.100]  I smoke some of the High Terpene Full Spectrum Extract
[02:54.100 --> 02:56.380]  that came from the Lemon Jeffrey, and it fixes it,
[02:56.380 --> 02:59.260]  it makes my brain work better, so it's a great combo for me.
[02:59.260 --> 03:02.260]  I love the Lemon Jeffrey High Terpene Full Spectrum Extract.
[03:02.260 --> 03:03.980]  I love anything Lemon Jeffrey.
[03:03.980 --> 03:05.940]  Of course, I bred it, so of course I'm gonna love it,
[03:05.940 --> 03:07.980]  but that is one of my favorites.
[03:07.980 --> 03:09.060]  So shout out to everybody involved
[03:09.060 --> 03:10.380]  in the concentrates today.
[03:11.300 --> 03:13.180]  Yeah, let's get to a podcast, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:13.180 --> 03:14.220]  I'm gonna turn down this music.
[03:14.220 --> 03:15.340]  I do have some sad news.
[03:15.340 --> 03:17.700]  I hate starting off the podcast with sad news,
[03:17.700 --> 03:20.300]  but I've got news I must share.
[03:21.940 --> 03:23.780]  Anybody that knows me knows that I have been listening
[03:23.780 --> 03:26.100]  to a reggae artist by the name of Joseph Israel
[03:26.100 --> 03:27.220]  for quite a few years.
[03:27.220 --> 03:30.580]  I met Joseph Israel when I lived in Lawrence, Kansas.
[03:30.580 --> 03:32.980]  He was coming through playing a couple of shows,
[03:32.980 --> 03:35.520]  and I got the privilege of promoting for the two shows
[03:35.520 --> 03:37.160]  that he did there in Lawrence,
[03:37.160 --> 03:38.320]  and since I promoted for him,
[03:38.320 --> 03:39.720]  of course I got to meet him and hang out,
[03:39.720 --> 03:40.560]  and he was really cool.
[03:40.560 --> 03:41.380]  He did a great reggae show.
[03:41.380 --> 03:42.220]  I loved his band.
[03:42.220 --> 03:43.200]  I loved his style.
[03:43.200 --> 03:44.880]  I loved his vibe.
[03:44.880 --> 03:45.800]  That's the first time I met him.
[03:45.800 --> 03:47.760]  The first time I saw Joseph,
[03:47.760 --> 03:50.360]  I was taken to a Matis Yahoo concert
[03:50.360 --> 03:52.720]  at the Beaumont Theater in Kansas City, Missouri
[03:52.720 --> 03:55.960]  for my birthday in 2006,
[03:55.960 --> 03:59.600]  and Matis Yahoo brought out this guy named Joseph Israel.
[03:59.600 --> 04:01.960]  He brought him on stage, and they sing a song together,
[04:01.960 --> 04:03.360]  and I was like, man, that guy's pretty cool.
[04:03.360 --> 04:05.500]  I'm gonna have to look for that guy in the future,
[04:05.500 --> 04:06.980]  and then shortly after that,
[04:06.980 --> 04:08.740]  I hear that he is coming to Lawrence, Kansas,
[04:08.740 --> 04:09.820]  where I was living at the time,
[04:09.820 --> 04:12.260]  and my friend was a promoter and a booker,
[04:12.260 --> 04:14.660]  and he happened to book Joseph Israel,
[04:14.660 --> 04:15.980]  and he knows I'm a reggae fan,
[04:15.980 --> 04:16.900]  so he came to me, and he said,
[04:16.900 --> 04:19.140]  hey, will you promote this show for me,
[04:19.140 --> 04:21.900]  which meant pass out flyers, pass out stickers,
[04:21.900 --> 04:24.260]  just talk about it, make sure that everybody in town
[04:24.260 --> 04:25.780]  knows that this guy is coming,
[04:25.780 --> 04:27.640]  and in return, he gave me a free ticket
[04:27.640 --> 04:29.860]  to a Burning Spear concert that was coming up,
[04:29.860 --> 04:31.900]  and then I advertised for Joseph Israel
[04:31.900 --> 04:33.160]  at the Burning Spear concert.
[04:33.160 --> 04:34.300]  Everyone's leaving Burning Spear.
[04:34.300 --> 04:36.940]  I'm gonna pass out flyers for Joseph Israel.
[04:36.940 --> 04:38.740]  So a lot of people came to the Joseph Israel show.
[04:38.740 --> 04:43.240]  I got to meet Joseph, also known as Joseph Fennell,
[04:43.240 --> 04:46.700]  or to his family and friends, he was Jojo or Joey.
[04:46.700 --> 04:48.060]  So I got to meet Joseph Israel.
[04:48.060 --> 04:48.900]  We became friends.
[04:48.900 --> 04:49.720]  We talked a lot.
[04:49.720 --> 04:52.400]  Joseph was a very knowledgeable
[04:52.400 --> 04:54.720]  and spiritual and peaceful person.
[04:54.720 --> 04:58.140]  Every time he came through Colorado or wherever I was,
[04:58.140 --> 04:59.780]  he would stop and take a minute
[04:59.780 --> 05:02.580]  and spend some time with me after his shows.
[05:02.580 --> 05:03.700]  Joseph was a great person.
[05:04.020 --> 05:05.100]  He was a great teacher.
[05:05.100 --> 05:06.280]  Obviously, what I'm leading up to
[05:06.280 --> 05:07.820]  is my friend Joseph has passed away.
[05:07.820 --> 05:10.700]  He's no longer with us, and I'm heartbroken.
[05:10.700 --> 05:12.940]  I'm gonna be okay, but I had to take a minute
[05:12.940 --> 05:14.940]  to share my love for Joseph on the show.
[05:16.420 --> 05:18.740]  Ah, Joseph, I miss you, and I love you.
[05:18.740 --> 05:20.440]  Cancer's a motherfucker, you guys.
[05:21.380 --> 05:23.620]  Joseph was a very healthy,
[05:23.620 --> 05:25.700]  well, tried to be a very healthy person.
[05:25.700 --> 05:27.340]  Joseph didn't drink alcohol.
[05:27.340 --> 05:29.260]  Joseph didn't do drugs.
[05:29.260 --> 05:32.020]  Joseph smoked very little cannabis.
[05:32.020 --> 05:34.540]  He did consume cannabis, but he wasn't a pothead.
[05:34.540 --> 05:39.060]  He smoked medicinally or, I don't even know, spiritually.
[05:39.060 --> 05:40.100]  He smoked spiritually.
[05:40.100 --> 05:42.580]  He wouldn't smoke every time we lit up,
[05:42.580 --> 05:44.900]  but sometimes he'd wanna participate
[05:44.900 --> 05:46.640]  if the time was right for him.
[05:46.640 --> 05:47.700]  He didn't drink caffeine.
[05:47.700 --> 05:48.660]  He didn't drink alcohol.
[05:48.660 --> 05:50.040]  He didn't eat processed foods.
[05:50.040 --> 05:52.680]  He lived on a farm in California with his family,
[05:52.680 --> 05:54.940]  and he raised his own fruits and vegetables
[05:54.940 --> 05:59.940]  and ate his own foods and taught about eating clean
[06:00.100 --> 06:01.180]  and taking care of yourself,
[06:01.180 --> 06:02.940]  and the dude died of cancer at 40,
[06:02.940 --> 06:04.460]  and I find it to be fucked up.
[06:04.460 --> 06:06.940]  Cancer's a motherfucker, you guys.
[06:06.940 --> 06:08.420]  Surround yourself with people you love
[06:08.420 --> 06:09.760]  and spend some time with the people you love
[06:09.760 --> 06:11.980]  because Joseph was healthy,
[06:11.980 --> 06:14.500]  and then one day he wasn't healthy, and then he was gone.
[06:14.500 --> 06:16.060]  There was no warning.
[06:16.060 --> 06:17.260]  There was no time to deal with it
[06:17.260 --> 06:18.900]  or prepare for it or cope with it.
[06:18.900 --> 06:20.940]  It was just, hey, I'm on tour.
[06:20.940 --> 06:23.100]  Hey, I'm home, and then it was, hey, everybody,
[06:23.100 --> 06:25.060]  I have cancer, and I'm gonna try to deal with it,
[06:25.060 --> 06:26.900]  and then in the middle of that process,
[06:26.900 --> 06:29.420]  he didn't make it, and he's gone.
[06:29.420 --> 06:32.500]  So you guys, shit happens so quickly.
[06:32.500 --> 06:33.860]  Don't let weird shit hold you back
[06:33.860 --> 06:35.240]  from loving the people that you love.
[06:35.240 --> 06:36.460]  Go tell somebody you love them.
[06:36.460 --> 06:37.740]  Go give somebody a hug.
[06:37.740 --> 06:38.580]  Be around those people
[06:38.580 --> 06:41.560]  because cancer gives you some time.
[06:41.560 --> 06:44.740]  Car crashes happen fucking unexpectedly and surprisingly.
[06:44.740 --> 06:46.480]  Heart attacks happen immediately.
[06:47.420 --> 06:49.380]  You never really know when the people that you love
[06:49.380 --> 06:51.820]  can be taken from you, so love them while they're here.
[06:51.820 --> 06:54.660]  Joseph, I love you, and I miss you,
[06:54.660 --> 06:56.900]  and I'll see you on the other side, brother.
[06:56.900 --> 06:58.560]  All right, podcast world.
[06:58.560 --> 07:00.520]  I think after that, I'm gonna press pause.
[07:00.520 --> 07:01.720]  I'm gonna get a drink.
[07:01.720 --> 07:03.640]  Gonna take way too big of a dab,
[07:03.640 --> 07:04.600]  and then I'll be right back
[07:04.600 --> 07:06.960]  to read some emails about auto-flowering.
[07:06.960 --> 07:07.800]  Thank you, guys.
[07:38.100 --> 07:39.660]  All right, podcast world, I am back.
[07:39.660 --> 07:40.820]  I am well-medicated.
[07:40.820 --> 07:42.620]  I am well-hydrated.
[07:42.620 --> 07:44.260]  I'm ready to deliver content.

[07:53.500 --> 07:55.660]  All right, before I took a break,
[07:55.660 --> 07:56.660]  I said that I was gonna come back

[07:58.980 --> 08:00.380]  so let's get right to that.

[08:41.200 --> 08:42.040]  for a few years.
[08:42.040 --> 08:43.700]  Hey, you're doing it the right way, man.
[08:43.700 --> 08:45.420]  Listening, reading, and researching
[08:45.420 --> 08:47.060]  are definitely the first step,
[08:47.060 --> 08:48.460]  so you're on the right path.
[08:48.460 --> 08:51.660]  He goes on to say, I'm finally ready to start a run
[08:51.660 --> 08:53.100]  except for a couple of things.
[08:53.100 --> 08:55.860]  First off, I'm in a not so legal state.
[08:55.860 --> 08:59.540]  Oh, dude, be careful, and be careful.
[08:59.540 --> 09:00.740]  That's all I can really say.
[09:00.740 --> 09:01.580]  Be careful.
[09:02.740 --> 09:04.220]  Secondly, I'm kind of torn between
[09:04.220 --> 09:06.500]  auto flower and photo period.
[09:06.500 --> 09:08.260]  Really quickly, I will say photo period,
[09:08.260 --> 09:10.020]  just because I prefer photo period.
[09:10.020 --> 09:12.060]  I don't like auto flower plants personally.
[09:12.060 --> 09:13.880]  I would just say go with photo period.
[09:13.880 --> 09:14.860]  I'll keep going with the email.
[09:14.860 --> 09:16.540]  It says, I am leaning towards a high grow,
[09:16.540 --> 09:18.540]  1000 watt LED and a tent.
[09:18.540 --> 09:19.860]  I've been trying to find some soil
[09:19.860 --> 09:22.040]  and go as organically as possible,
[09:22.040 --> 09:23.720]  all while trying to not break the bank.
[09:23.720 --> 09:25.200]  If you have any insight for me,
[09:25.200 --> 09:26.680]  it would be greatly appreciated.
[09:26.680 --> 09:29.160]  I wasn't sure if you had an auto flower episode
[09:29.160 --> 09:30.320]  you couldn't refer me to.
[09:30.320 --> 09:32.440]  Thanks for being outspoken for the cause.
[09:32.440 --> 09:33.840]  Keep up the amazing work,
[09:33.840 --> 09:35.280]  and when I get the first harvest,
[09:35.280 --> 09:39.360]  on the lookout, or be on the lookout for me on Patreon.
[09:39.360 --> 09:40.300]  All right.
[09:40.300 --> 09:41.140]  So a couple of things.
[09:41.140 --> 09:42.280]  You asked for advice.
[09:42.280 --> 09:44.500]  First off, you are not in a legal state,
[09:44.500 --> 09:47.560]  so my advice to you once again is be completely careful.
[09:47.560 --> 09:48.420]  Be very discreet.
[09:48.420 --> 09:49.500]  Do not trust anybody.
[09:49.500 --> 09:50.440]  Don't show anybody.
[09:50.440 --> 09:51.760]  Don't bring anybody to your grow.
[09:52.480 --> 09:53.320]  Don't tell anybody about your grow.
[09:53.320 --> 09:54.800]  Don't post pictures of your grow.
[09:54.800 --> 09:55.920]  Hide that grow.
[09:55.920 --> 09:59.520]  It is your new biggest fucking secret.
[09:59.520 --> 10:01.840]  The first person you tell is gonna tell another person,
[10:01.840 --> 10:03.520]  and that person is gonna tell another person,
[10:03.520 --> 10:05.200]  and if you're in a not legal state,
[10:05.200 --> 10:07.160]  one of those people is going to be a cop,
[10:07.160 --> 10:08.280]  and you're gonna get fucked.
[10:08.280 --> 10:09.640]  Don't tell anybody.
[10:09.640 --> 10:11.400]  Don't bring chicks to your grow.
[10:11.400 --> 10:13.520]  There's no reason for you to impress girls
[10:13.520 --> 10:15.080]  by taking them to your grow.
[10:15.080 --> 10:17.440]  Impress yourself by having a cool ass secret
[10:17.440 --> 10:19.280]  that none of those girls get to know.
[10:19.280 --> 10:21.040]  Smoke dank ass weed with those girls,
[10:21.040 --> 10:23.240]  but make them think you're buying it somewhere.
[10:23.240 --> 10:25.640]  Don't take girls to your grow to impress them.
[10:25.640 --> 10:28.480]  Don't bring dudes to your grow to impress them.
[10:28.480 --> 10:30.520]  There's no reason to have anybody in your garden.
[10:30.520 --> 10:32.200]  If they know where it is, they can steal it,
[10:32.200 --> 10:34.600]  they can snitch on it, they can cause you problems.
[10:34.600 --> 10:35.660]  Don't tell anybody.
[10:35.660 --> 10:36.760]  Keep it a secret.
[10:36.760 --> 10:37.600]  And now you're gonna say,
[10:37.600 --> 10:39.540]  Rasta Jeff, you post pictures of your garden every day.
[10:39.540 --> 10:42.080]  Yes, I live in Colorado where it is legal,
[10:42.080 --> 10:44.840]  and I'm not gonna go to jail for having a cannabis plant.
[10:44.840 --> 10:45.720]  So be careful.
[10:45.720 --> 10:48.300]  Grow photo period plants, and don't tell anybody.
[10:48.300 --> 10:50.040]  Don't bring anybody to your grow.
[10:50.040 --> 10:55.040]  Also, try to not be seen at the grow store too frequently.
[10:55.860 --> 10:58.340]  If you go to the hydroponic store in your neighborhood,
[10:58.340 --> 11:00.020]  and they start knowing you,
[11:00.020 --> 11:01.680]  that means that you've been seen there,
[11:01.680 --> 11:03.960]  and that means that somebody knows what you're doing,
[11:03.960 --> 11:05.400]  and you will be looked at.
[11:05.400 --> 11:07.460]  If you can get things delivered through Amazon,
[11:07.460 --> 11:09.400]  I would recommend getting them from Amazon,
[11:09.400 --> 11:10.880]  because everything comes in a box,
[11:10.880 --> 11:12.820]  and it has an Amazon smile on it.
[11:12.820 --> 11:14.160]  Nobody knows what's in there.
[11:14.160 --> 11:15.560]  You could be getting cleaning supplies,
[11:15.560 --> 11:16.480]  you could be getting food,
[11:16.480 --> 11:17.720]  you could be getting electronics,
[11:17.720 --> 11:19.320]  you could have gotten a new sweater.
[11:19.320 --> 11:21.560]  Nobody knows that you've got a whole bunch of nutrients
[11:21.560 --> 11:22.520]  in that box.
[11:22.520 --> 11:24.720]  So I recommend buying your stuff online.
[11:24.720 --> 11:26.500]  That way you don't have to go to a grow store,
[11:26.500 --> 11:28.020]  especially in an illegal area.
[11:28.020 --> 11:30.340]  Also, it's much cheaper online.
[11:30.340 --> 11:31.180]  I know that sounds terrible,
[11:31.180 --> 11:32.580]  because you should support local business,
[11:32.580 --> 11:34.360]  but when local business wants to rip you off,
[11:34.360 --> 11:35.860]  buy it online, save the money.
[11:36.940 --> 11:37.780]  What else?
[11:37.780 --> 11:38.820]  Any insight for you?
[11:38.820 --> 11:43.500]  You're trying to go 1,000 watt LED and a tent.
[11:43.500 --> 11:44.400]  That sounds great.
[11:44.400 --> 11:46.500]  A five by five tent or a four by four.
[11:46.500 --> 11:48.320]  That would be perfect.
[11:48.340 --> 11:50.420]  That's going to use a little bit of electricity.
[11:50.420 --> 11:52.960]  Do you have a reason why your power bill went up?
[11:52.960 --> 11:54.180]  There may be questions.
[11:54.180 --> 11:55.400]  Just keep that in mind.
[11:55.400 --> 11:58.620]  You're gonna have to control odor, get a carbon filter.
[11:58.620 --> 12:00.120]  Also, put it in a part of the house
[12:00.120 --> 12:01.900]  where nobody's gonna go.
[12:01.900 --> 12:03.700]  Now, something I've got to mention.
[12:04.820 --> 12:06.500]  You said you're in an illegal state.
[12:06.500 --> 12:08.940]  I've got to encourage you to follow the rules,
[12:08.940 --> 12:13.100]  not break the laws, and do what the state laws are there.
[12:13.100 --> 12:16.300]  And if you don't, I have to tell you to be prepared
[12:16.320 --> 12:17.840]  for what could happen to you
[12:17.840 --> 12:19.640]  and whoever else is in that home
[12:19.640 --> 12:21.600]  if something should go wrong.
[12:21.600 --> 12:24.220]  I don't want anything to go wrong with anybody,
[12:24.220 --> 12:25.600]  but you have to keep in mind
[12:25.600 --> 12:28.080]  if you're growing cannabis in an illegal state,
[12:28.080 --> 12:29.920]  shit could go wrong.
[12:29.920 --> 12:31.880]  The door could get torn off the hinges.
[12:32.840 --> 12:36.080]  Men in uniforms with guns could come in your front door
[12:36.080 --> 12:39.760]  and put those guns in the faces of everybody in that home.
[12:39.760 --> 12:41.680]  They will destroy your home.
[12:41.680 --> 12:43.600]  They will destroy your garden.
[12:43.600 --> 12:46.200]  They're going to destroy your equipment.
[12:46.980 --> 12:48.460]  During the investigation and raid,
[12:48.460 --> 12:52.420]  they will destroy everything that means something to you.
[12:52.420 --> 12:53.660]  Your speakers will be cut
[12:53.660 --> 12:56.180]  because there's possible drugs hidden inside of your speakers.
[12:56.180 --> 12:57.760]  Your couch cushions will be cut open
[12:57.760 --> 13:00.300]  because there could be drugs inside of your couch cushions.
[13:00.300 --> 13:02.480]  Your contents of your fridge and freezer
[13:02.480 --> 13:03.580]  will be dumped on the floor
[13:03.580 --> 13:05.340]  because there could be drugs in there.
[13:05.340 --> 13:06.220]  And guess what?
[13:06.220 --> 13:09.020]  They take you to jail, they leave your house unlocked,
[13:09.020 --> 13:10.540]  and your house is open for your neighbors
[13:10.540 --> 13:13.260]  to fucking steal all of your shit while you're in jail.
[13:13.260 --> 13:16.100]  You get bailed out, hopefully, if you've got good friends.
[13:16.840 --> 13:18.920]  Then you get home and all of your shit is in disarray.
[13:18.920 --> 13:20.480]  Your plants are gone.
[13:20.480 --> 13:22.200]  You're probably fired from your job
[13:22.200 --> 13:24.960]  because you were just on the news for having an illegal grow.
[13:24.960 --> 13:27.480]  Your life will never be the same.
[13:27.480 --> 13:29.880]  So be prepared if you're going to grow cannabis
[13:29.880 --> 13:31.200]  in an illegal state.
[13:31.200 --> 13:33.880]  Keep in mind that this is what could happen to you.
[13:33.880 --> 13:36.760]  You could go to jail for a very long time.
[13:36.760 --> 13:38.560]  You may not see your loved ones.
[13:38.560 --> 13:40.680]  You might not get to smoke cannabis for a while.
[13:40.680 --> 13:42.240]  You may not get no booty for a while.
[13:42.240 --> 13:44.820]  You might, but it might not be the booty you want.
[13:44.840 --> 13:47.040]  You may be given some booty.
[13:47.040 --> 13:48.800]  Keep that shit in mind if you're planning
[13:48.800 --> 13:51.400]  on growing cannabis in an illegal state.
[13:51.400 --> 13:56.000]  Being a broadcaster, being a responsible adult,
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.400]  being somebody who wants to keep us both out of trouble,
[13:58.400 --> 14:01.360]  I have to say out loud, I discourage anybody
[14:01.360 --> 14:05.360]  from breaking the law or growing cannabis illegally.
[14:05.360 --> 14:06.720]  I also know that we're adults
[14:06.720 --> 14:07.960]  and I know that people are gonna do
[14:07.960 --> 14:09.860]  whatever the fuck they wanna do.
[14:09.860 --> 14:11.860]  And I can also encourage you to think
[14:11.860 --> 14:13.440]  and do what you like as an adult.
[14:13.460 --> 14:15.340]  But I have to say, legally, you shouldn't grow cannabis.
[14:15.340 --> 14:18.060]  But keep in mind that when you do break the law
[14:18.060 --> 14:19.460]  because you're an adult with free will,
[14:19.460 --> 14:20.980]  shit could go wrong.
[14:20.980 --> 14:24.140]  And I want you to have that slight fear in your mind
[14:24.140 --> 14:26.660]  because that's what's gonna keep you careful.
[14:26.660 --> 14:29.460]  Bringing that hot girl from the bar to your grow
[14:29.460 --> 14:31.760]  is going to get you sent to prison.
[14:31.760 --> 14:34.380]  Don't bring the hot girl from the bar to your grow.
[14:34.380 --> 14:36.060]  Take the hot girl from the bar to your house
[14:36.060 --> 14:37.140]  and smoke weed with her
[14:37.140 --> 14:39.420]  and don't let her ever know you had a grow.
[14:39.420 --> 14:40.820]  That's the way to do it.
[14:40.820 --> 14:42.380]  I'm just trying to put it in your head, you guys.
[14:42.400 --> 14:44.040]  Shit could go terribly wrong.
[14:44.040 --> 14:45.520]  Trying to keep us all on the right path.
[14:45.520 --> 14:48.100]  You can't grow from your heart if you're in a fucking cell.
[14:48.100 --> 14:49.480]  Wow, that was just a random rant.
[14:49.480 --> 14:51.160]  I did not write anything down about that.
[14:51.160 --> 14:53.320]  That just came to my head while I was talking about this.
[14:53.320 --> 14:55.640]  So, that's some advice.
[14:55.640 --> 14:58.280]  Also, you're talking about trying to save some money.
[14:58.280 --> 15:01.180]  You're gonna have to spend decent money on your light.
[15:01.180 --> 15:03.000]  You're also talking about going organic
[15:03.000 --> 15:04.840]  and not breaking the bank.
[15:04.840 --> 15:06.520]  You're gonna have to spend good money
[15:06.520 --> 15:08.480]  on good amendments and good soil.
[15:08.480 --> 15:09.720]  Don't be a cheapskate on that
[15:09.720 --> 15:12.080]  because your plants will show you
[15:12.780 --> 15:14.020]  that you were a cheap ass in the beginning.
[15:14.020 --> 15:15.540]  Now, let's get to the main part that you talked about.
[15:15.540 --> 15:18.280]  You said, I wasn't sure if you had an auto flower episode
[15:18.280 --> 15:19.580]  you couldn't refer me to.
[15:19.580 --> 15:21.620]  I did do an auto flower episode
[15:21.620 --> 15:24.220]  where basically I said that they're not for me.
[15:24.220 --> 15:27.140]  Auto flowers do have a time and a place.
[15:27.140 --> 15:29.860]  I don't like an auto flower because you can't take clones.
[15:29.860 --> 15:31.180]  What if you grow that auto flower
[15:31.180 --> 15:33.220]  and it's the most amazing shit you've ever grown?
[15:33.220 --> 15:34.620]  You cannot take a clone of it.
[15:34.620 --> 15:36.580]  You have to buy seeds every time.
[15:36.580 --> 15:38.140]  It's not sustainable.
[15:38.140 --> 15:39.580]  If you've only got one space
[15:39.580 --> 15:40.980]  and you're not looking to keep clones
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.040]  and keep a mom and have a veg space,
[15:43.040 --> 15:44.980]  maybe auto flowers are the way to go.
[15:44.980 --> 15:46.660]  That way you can run one room
[15:46.660 --> 15:48.600]  and you can just have constant stuff going.
[15:48.600 --> 15:50.480]  You can plant seeds every three weeks
[15:50.480 --> 15:52.040]  and you can keep them all in the same room
[15:52.040 --> 15:53.600]  and then your shit will just keep flowering.
[15:53.600 --> 15:56.240]  I am not experienced enough with auto flowers
[15:56.240 --> 15:57.740]  to have very good advice.
[15:57.740 --> 15:59.720]  I don't like auto flowers.
[15:59.720 --> 16:01.160]  So I don't have a lot of advice.
[16:01.160 --> 16:04.840]  My advice would be to grow photo period plants.
[16:04.840 --> 16:06.240]  That's what I've said before.
[16:06.240 --> 16:08.240]  So that's my advice still.
[16:08.240 --> 16:10.520]  You also say, thanks for being outspoken for the cause.
[16:11.060 --> 16:11.900]  Keep up the amazing work.
[16:11.900 --> 16:13.140]  And when I get the first harvest,
[16:13.140 --> 16:16.620]  be on the lookout for me on Patreon.
[16:16.620 --> 16:19.100]  Hey dude, I hope that first harvest comes off well.
[16:19.100 --> 16:20.120]  I hope you stay out of trouble
[16:20.120 --> 16:21.300]  and I hope nothing goes wrong
[16:21.300 --> 16:23.020]  and I look forward to seeing you on Patreon.
[16:23.020 --> 16:24.620]  Either way, thanks for the support.
[16:24.620 --> 16:25.460]  I still love you.
[16:25.460 --> 16:26.840]  And then he also said,
[16:26.840 --> 16:28.520]  thanks for being outspoken for the cause
[16:28.520 --> 16:30.220]  and to keep up the good work, dude.
[16:30.220 --> 16:33.540]  I think that was my job was to be outspoken for cannabis.
[16:33.540 --> 16:36.140]  So I do not plan on stopping.
[16:36.140 --> 16:38.420]  As long as I am physically able and mentally able
[16:38.420 --> 16:39.540]  and I've got all the right equipment,
[16:39.560 --> 16:42.880]  I will continue to do this podcast until it's not possible.
[16:42.880 --> 16:46.040]  In fact, one day I would like to transition
[16:46.040 --> 16:49.000]  to this being mostly my career.
[16:49.000 --> 16:51.640]  I'm not gonna be young and agile forever.
[16:51.640 --> 16:54.020]  And when I get too old to be working in a grow
[16:54.020 --> 16:54.880]  and doing stuff like that,
[16:54.880 --> 16:57.240]  I'd like to just shift to new media
[16:57.240 --> 16:59.000]  and podcasting and YouTube
[16:59.000 --> 17:00.920]  and that sort of thing and consulting.
[17:00.920 --> 17:04.520]  If I could provide the income that I provide
[17:04.520 --> 17:07.280]  by having a full-time job by podcasting,
[17:07.280 --> 17:08.840]  I would totally make the transition
[17:08.860 --> 17:12.380]  and I would do five new episodes a week.
[17:12.380 --> 17:15.460]  And then I would do four or five YouTube videos a week.
[17:15.460 --> 17:17.740]  I would still find a way to be in commercial grows
[17:17.740 --> 17:19.240]  and spend some time in large gardens.
[17:19.240 --> 17:20.620]  But as I get older,
[17:20.620 --> 17:21.940]  I'm not gonna be able to work so hard.
[17:21.940 --> 17:24.580]  So that may be the plan for the future.
[17:24.580 --> 17:26.680]  Anyway, thanks for the great email.
[17:26.680 --> 17:28.580]  You inspired a lot of good ranting.
[17:28.580 --> 17:30.740]  If anybody else out there has a question about cannabis
[17:30.740 --> 17:32.700]  and you'd like me to read it on a future episode,
[17:32.700 --> 17:34.160]  you can send me an email.
[17:34.160 --> 17:37.600]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[17:37.600 --> 17:39.300]  I would love to hear from you.
[17:39.300 --> 17:40.900]  So this next email comes from somebody
[17:40.900 --> 17:43.220]  that I've interacted with before.
[17:43.220 --> 17:45.860]  They actually sent me an email about auto flowers.
[17:45.860 --> 17:48.140]  So let's read the most recent email.
[17:48.140 --> 17:48.980]  It goes like this.
[17:48.980 --> 17:50.980]  Rasta Jeff, your reply to my email
[17:50.980 --> 17:53.940]  and my continuing listening to your awesome podcast
[17:53.940 --> 17:56.980]  has led me to change the way I've been thinking.
[17:56.980 --> 17:58.020]  In my previous email,
[17:58.020 --> 18:00.140]  I was highly considering auto flowers.
[18:00.140 --> 18:02.300]  After listening to a couple of episodes on breeding
[18:02.300 --> 18:05.200]  that you put out, I have changed my mind.
[18:05.200 --> 18:07.180]  I did a bit of soul searching and asked myself
[18:07.680 --> 18:09.520]  what I really wanted to get out of my grow.
[18:09.520 --> 18:11.560]  I came to the conclusion that it's not the speed
[18:11.560 --> 18:12.880]  of a grow necessarily.
[18:12.880 --> 18:14.600]  It's more about taking care of a plant
[18:14.600 --> 18:16.240]  that has been around for centuries
[18:16.240 --> 18:19.320]  and to improve upon it if I can.
[18:19.320 --> 18:22.000]  A good medicine for people who truly need and enjoy it
[18:22.000 --> 18:23.200]  is my goal at this point.
[18:23.200 --> 18:26.680]  So you've got a goal, so you're already on the right track.
[18:26.680 --> 18:28.900]  Hopefully, when my state comes out of the dark ages,
[18:28.900 --> 18:31.080]  I'll be ready to step into the light with it,
[18:31.080 --> 18:33.540]  much like you and other pioneers have done.
[18:33.540 --> 18:35.380]  Now onto my question.
[18:35.400 --> 18:37.480]  I have a thousand watt LED that is suited
[18:37.480 --> 18:39.160]  for a four by four footprint.
[18:39.160 --> 18:42.080]  I picked up some Digital Dream from Hella Dank.
[18:42.080 --> 18:44.560]  I've got 13 regular seeds.
[18:44.560 --> 18:46.880]  How many of those seeds should I germinate
[18:46.880 --> 18:49.520]  to ensure that I'm able to fill the light?
[18:49.520 --> 18:51.900]  I can put some outside as well.
[18:51.900 --> 18:55.240]  Also, have you heard of Bloom City Organic Nutrients?
[18:55.240 --> 18:56.600]  And one more question,
[18:56.600 --> 18:59.080]  would a five gallon fabric pot be suitable
[18:59.080 --> 19:02.280]  for what I think to be a big photo period plant?
[19:02.280 --> 19:03.700]  Thanks again for all you do.
[19:03.720 --> 19:06.480]  Tell Larry OG hi for me, an avid listener,
[19:06.480 --> 19:08.560]  and then he signed it Lone Star.
[19:08.560 --> 19:11.120]  All right, there's a lot of stuff to cover in here.
[19:11.120 --> 19:13.200]  First off, I'm glad that you decided
[19:13.200 --> 19:15.940]  to grow photo period plants
[19:15.940 --> 19:17.840]  for the exact reason that you decided.
[19:17.840 --> 19:19.920]  You want to move this plant forward
[19:19.920 --> 19:23.020]  and you wanna grow quality medicine and nourish a plant.
[19:23.020 --> 19:24.520]  An autoflower plant,
[19:24.520 --> 19:26.780]  that's just fast food of cannabis in my opinion.
[19:26.780 --> 19:29.900]  You want to prepare a meal and you wanna nourish people,
[19:29.900 --> 19:33.360]  and I think that's a great way to look at it, so thank you.
[19:34.020 --> 19:34.860]  Then you also say,
[19:35.800 --> 19:36.980]  you've got a thousand watt LED,
[19:36.980 --> 19:39.460]  it's suited for a four by four, that is perfect.
[19:39.460 --> 19:41.980]  Then how many of those seeds should you germinate
[19:43.100 --> 19:44.660]  to be able to fill the light?
[19:44.660 --> 19:46.820]  I would germinate all of them.
[19:46.820 --> 19:48.560]  I would germinate all 13 seeds,
[19:48.560 --> 19:51.620]  but only if a few things apply.
[19:51.620 --> 19:55.220]  Do you have space to take a clone of all 13?
[19:55.220 --> 19:57.180]  I would like to, this is what I would do.
[19:57.180 --> 19:59.180]  I would germinate all 13.
[19:59.180 --> 20:01.940]  I would veg them out in small pots.
[20:01.960 --> 20:04.680]  I would use six inch net pots or one gallon,
[20:04.680 --> 20:07.440]  maybe two gallon pots at the most, go small.
[20:07.440 --> 20:10.000]  Veg them out until you're able to get one clone
[20:10.000 --> 20:11.480]  off of each plant.
[20:11.480 --> 20:14.120]  Hopefully you've got good clone tech and one is enough.
[20:14.120 --> 20:16.440]  If you don't trust yourself with one,
[20:16.440 --> 20:18.560]  take two in case they die.
[20:18.560 --> 20:22.000]  So get one or two clones off of each little plant.
[20:22.000 --> 20:23.880]  As soon as you see roots on that clone,
[20:23.880 --> 20:26.960]  start flowering the originals, okay?
[20:26.960 --> 20:30.200]  Now you're gonna find boys within seven to 12 days.
[20:30.220 --> 20:32.740]  You'll know the boys, get them the fuck out of there.
[20:32.740 --> 20:36.540]  You're going to have approximately 50% boys.
[20:36.540 --> 20:39.260]  So now you're down to somewhere between five and seven
[20:39.260 --> 20:41.660]  plants in a four by four area.
[20:41.660 --> 20:42.900]  Now that's a nice little run.
[20:42.900 --> 20:44.800]  You're gonna have to veg those to fill in the space
[20:44.800 --> 20:47.280]  a little bit more, but those are gonna fill in
[20:47.280 --> 20:48.600]  your four by four area.
[20:48.600 --> 20:49.860]  Now you've got clones.
[20:49.860 --> 20:52.800]  Hopefully those clones root and you're gonna have
[20:52.800 --> 20:54.820]  plant number one and clone number one
[20:54.820 --> 20:56.740]  and plant number two and clone number two.
[20:56.740 --> 20:59.100]  Make sure you label them to where the clone
[20:59.100 --> 21:01.540]  and the corresponding plant are obvious.
[21:01.540 --> 21:02.840]  You don't want any questions here
[21:02.840 --> 21:05.960]  because what you're gonna do, this is called a phenohunt.
[21:05.960 --> 21:07.960]  You're gonna grow these seeds and you're gonna find
[21:07.960 --> 21:10.840]  one or two that are perfect for you.
[21:10.840 --> 21:12.660]  Others aren't gonna be the ones you want.
[21:12.660 --> 21:14.740]  One's gonna be undesirable completely.
[21:14.740 --> 21:16.860]  One's gonna grow too tall or too funky.
[21:16.860 --> 21:18.300]  One's gonna be weird.
[21:18.300 --> 21:19.840]  There are gonna be one or two in there
[21:19.840 --> 21:21.680]  that are what you're looking for.
[21:21.680 --> 21:24.440]  So find those and hopefully you've got a clone.
[21:24.440 --> 21:27.120]  Get rid of all the other clones and keep those two.
[21:27.140 --> 21:30.020]  Or if there's one that's obvious, keep that one.
[21:30.020 --> 21:31.340]  We call that the keeper.
[21:31.340 --> 21:32.980]  The keeper pheno out of the pack.
[21:32.980 --> 21:34.140]  Keep that one.
[21:34.140 --> 21:37.500]  Now that is the one you want to grow over and over again.
[21:37.500 --> 21:39.380]  That's why you're gonna keep a mother plant of that.
[21:39.380 --> 21:41.100]  That's why we cut a clone of it.
[21:41.100 --> 21:44.480]  Now if you've only got one space, this may not be possible.
[21:45.700 --> 21:47.260]  You're not gonna have a place for clones.
[21:47.260 --> 21:48.820]  You're not gonna have a place for mothers.
[21:48.820 --> 21:50.860]  You're not gonna have a veg space.
[21:50.860 --> 21:53.540]  I would recommend having another small area for this.
[21:53.540 --> 21:55.820]  I understand it's not always possible.
[21:56.320 --> 21:57.560]  Here's another option.
[21:57.560 --> 22:00.200]  I would run all 13 of the seeds.
[22:00.200 --> 22:02.680]  Then I would put them into flower when they're little.
[22:02.680 --> 22:06.700]  As soon as they start showing you sex, take the boys out.
[22:06.700 --> 22:09.240]  Then put your plants back into veg.
[22:09.240 --> 22:11.600]  Give them at least 18 hours of light.
[22:11.600 --> 22:13.160]  Maybe 24, that's up to you.
[22:13.160 --> 22:15.920]  I prefer an 18 on, six off veg cycle.
[22:15.920 --> 22:18.480]  So put your plants back into veg.
[22:18.480 --> 22:20.640]  Now you know how many plants you're going to flower
[22:20.640 --> 22:24.120]  and you can up-pot them into larger pots
[22:24.140 --> 22:25.660]  and you can decide the size of pot
[22:25.660 --> 22:27.340]  based on how many there are.
[22:27.340 --> 22:28.900]  So if you've got more plants,
[22:28.900 --> 22:30.660]  you need to stay with smaller pots.
[22:30.660 --> 22:34.540]  If you have smaller numbers, you can use larger pots.
[22:34.540 --> 22:37.060]  Just decide based on how many females
[22:37.060 --> 22:38.980]  you're going to take to flower.
[22:38.980 --> 22:41.880]  So maybe you've got, if you've got four,
[22:41.880 --> 22:45.500]  then you can do four five-gallon pots if you'd like.
[22:45.500 --> 22:49.420]  If you've got six, I would do maybe three-gallon pots.
[22:49.420 --> 22:51.260]  Just kind of base it on how many you've got
[22:51.260 --> 22:52.280]  and how many are gonna fit
[22:52.280 --> 22:54.500]  in that four by four space comfortably.
[22:54.500 --> 22:56.860]  Also think about how long you want to veg.
[22:56.860 --> 22:58.340]  Do you want this to be a quick run?
[22:58.340 --> 22:59.620]  Do you want them in and out?
[22:59.620 --> 23:01.860]  If you want them in and out, stay in small pots.
[23:01.860 --> 23:03.020]  Don't even bother up-potting.
[23:03.020 --> 23:04.940]  You're gonna have to water more frequently,
[23:04.940 --> 23:06.940]  but small pots will work for you.
[23:06.940 --> 23:08.780]  If you want to veg them for quite a while
[23:08.780 --> 23:11.300]  in your limited space, I would do bigger pots.
[23:11.300 --> 23:14.260]  Bigger pots are gonna give you more time between waterings,
[23:14.260 --> 23:16.380]  but they also take up more space.
[23:16.380 --> 23:17.940]  So that's kind of the way I would think
[23:17.940 --> 23:19.620]  about how many to germinate.
[23:19.620 --> 23:21.340]  I know that our situations are different,
[23:21.360 --> 23:22.560]  but I would sprout them all.
[23:22.560 --> 23:23.720]  I would take a clone.
[23:23.720 --> 23:24.960]  I would find the good one.
[23:24.960 --> 23:26.840]  If you're unable to take clones, fuck it.
[23:26.840 --> 23:29.640]  Sprout them all, grow them all, finish it up,
[23:29.640 --> 23:32.060]  buy more seeds, do it again.
[23:32.060 --> 23:33.920]  Maybe when that first crop comes down,
[23:33.920 --> 23:36.780]  you get more space and you set yourself up a veg area
[23:36.780 --> 23:39.760]  so that you can take clones and keep those clones alive.
[23:39.760 --> 23:42.160]  Because one of the most heartbreaking things
[23:42.160 --> 23:43.480]  that has happened to me as a grower,
[23:43.480 --> 23:46.000]  as a new grower when I was just getting started,
[23:46.000 --> 23:49.120]  I would plant seeds and I would grow these plants
[23:49.120 --> 23:50.640]  and I would take pictures of them
[23:50.660 --> 23:52.860]  and I would nurture them for months.
[23:52.860 --> 23:55.140]  I would harvest them, I would dry them, I would cure them,
[23:55.140 --> 23:56.980]  I'd trim them up and I'd smoke them
[23:56.980 --> 23:58.700]  and it would be fucking amazing.
[23:58.700 --> 23:59.820]  And I didn't have any clones of it
[23:59.820 --> 24:01.540]  because I didn't know how to take clones worth of shit
[24:01.540 --> 24:02.840]  and my clones would die.
[24:02.840 --> 24:04.680]  And now I've got the most amazing smoke.
[24:04.680 --> 24:07.140]  All my friends are going, dude, this weed is so good.
[24:07.140 --> 24:08.300]  Where'd you get this?
[24:08.300 --> 24:10.700]  And I can't grow it again because I didn't keep a clone
[24:10.700 --> 24:12.840]  and I couldn't get the fucking clones to live.
[24:12.840 --> 24:16.120]  I actually had to go online and order another six
[24:16.120 --> 24:17.820]  or 12 pack of those seeds
[24:17.820 --> 24:20.080]  because I couldn't get the clones to root.
[24:20.100 --> 24:22.220]  So I always recommend every time you grow something,
[24:22.220 --> 24:24.180]  take a clone because you never know,
[24:24.180 --> 24:26.660]  you may have the most amazing thing you've ever grown
[24:26.660 --> 24:28.140]  and it's gonna be really heartbreaking
[24:28.140 --> 24:30.780]  if you start off your first grow or your second grow
[24:30.780 --> 24:33.060]  and you grow the hottest fire you've ever seen
[24:33.060 --> 24:34.620]  and you don't even have a clone.
[24:34.620 --> 24:36.060]  So that's my advice.
[24:36.060 --> 24:38.740]  Run them all, call the boys,
[24:39.860 --> 24:43.180]  figure out how many you've got, then up-pot from there.
[24:43.180 --> 24:44.340]  Now you may be asking yourself,
[24:44.340 --> 24:46.100]  did he say to put the plants in flour,
[24:46.100 --> 24:48.940]  wait for them to show sex and then put them back into veg?
[24:48.960 --> 24:51.240]  Yes, if you put them into flour,
[24:51.240 --> 24:54.200]  just long enough to show you if they're boys or girls.
[24:54.200 --> 24:56.860]  It shouldn't be more than seven to 12 days honestly,
[24:56.860 --> 24:58.900]  before they are fully showing you
[24:58.900 --> 25:00.800]  if they're a boy or a girl.
[25:00.800 --> 25:03.320]  Get some books, go online,
[25:03.320 --> 25:06.040]  find pictures of what male and female cannabis plants
[25:06.040 --> 25:08.680]  look like and become comfortable with identifying that
[25:08.680 --> 25:10.040]  before the time comes.
[25:10.040 --> 25:13.360]  So go in there, identify your males, get rid of them.
[25:13.360 --> 25:17.720]  Then I would probably put the lights on for 72 hours
[25:17.720 --> 25:18.600]  without a break.
[25:19.260 --> 25:20.100]  Just put them on for 72 hours.
[25:20.100 --> 25:21.420]  That's gonna tell those plants,
[25:21.420 --> 25:24.580]  you are not flowering anymore, it's time to go back to veg.
[25:24.580 --> 25:28.060]  So put them on for 48 to 72 hours,
[25:28.060 --> 25:29.820]  then start your 18 and six cycle
[25:29.820 --> 25:31.860]  and now your plants are back in veg.
[25:31.860 --> 25:35.160]  Then up-pot them to the appropriate pot size.
[25:35.160 --> 25:37.740]  Like I said, if you've got several left, go smaller pots.
[25:37.740 --> 25:40.540]  If you've only got a few left, go larger pots.
[25:40.540 --> 25:42.540]  In an indoor environment, in a tent like this,
[25:42.540 --> 25:44.360]  there's probably no reason to go larger
[25:44.360 --> 25:45.660]  than a five gallon pot.
[25:45.660 --> 25:47.620]  I've done seven gallon pots indoors,
[25:47.640 --> 25:50.240]  in a tent, I think it would be overkill.
[25:50.240 --> 25:52.400]  So don't be afraid to put them into flower
[25:52.400 --> 25:55.440]  and then bring them back once you see what you've got.
[25:55.440 --> 25:58.160]  And I think a five gallon pot would be suitable
[25:58.160 --> 25:59.920]  for your big photo period.
[25:59.920 --> 26:02.320]  I think three gallons are probably more appropriate.
[26:02.320 --> 26:04.840]  I run a three gallon if I'm using a tent.
[26:04.840 --> 26:05.880]  It just makes more sense to me.
[26:05.880 --> 26:07.640]  A smaller pot, smaller plant.
[26:07.640 --> 26:08.780]  You don't have as much ceiling height.
[26:08.780 --> 26:11.760]  You don't need big gigantic plants in a little grow hut.
[26:11.760 --> 26:14.000]  So a three or five gallon pot should be perfect.
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.040]  If you have a lot of plants, you could go even smaller.
[26:16.060 --> 26:19.220]  You could go one gallon pots and you'd be just fine.
[26:19.220 --> 26:20.620]  And then your other question was,
[26:20.620 --> 26:22.980]  have you heard of Bloom City Organic Nutrients?
[26:22.980 --> 26:25.700]  Unfortunately, I am not familiar with that brand.
[26:25.700 --> 26:29.820]  So I have no input on that part of your question.
[26:29.820 --> 26:31.260]  You also say, thanks for all you do.
[26:31.260 --> 26:33.300]  Hey man, thanks for the great email.
[26:33.300 --> 26:34.380]  Thanks for listening.
[26:34.380 --> 26:35.220]  Thanks for the support.
[26:35.220 --> 26:37.360]  And then you say, tell Larry OG hello for me.
[26:37.360 --> 26:38.240]  What up Larry?
[26:38.240 --> 26:39.700]  I'll give Larry OG a fist bump
[26:39.700 --> 26:41.300]  the next time I'm in the garden.
[26:42.160 --> 26:43.940]  Lone Star, thanks for listening.
[26:43.940 --> 26:44.780]  I appreciate it.
[26:44.780 --> 26:46.120]  And thanks again for the great email.
[26:46.120 --> 26:48.640]  I hope I was able to help you out.
[26:48.640 --> 26:50.280]  If you've got a question you'd like me to read

[26:58.960 --> 27:03.840]  Also big shout out to Matthew Moritz and my buddy MPG.
[27:03.840 --> 27:05.240]  You know who you are brother.
[27:05.240 --> 27:06.760]  I'm not sure if people want me to say their names
[27:06.760 --> 27:07.880]  but I want to give people shout outs.
[27:07.880 --> 27:11.960]  So I try to do it discreetly and respectfully.

[28:27.120 --> 28:28.620]  that I have never released before.
[28:28.620 --> 28:30.120]  I haven't decided what's coming out yet.
[28:30.120 --> 28:31.640]  I've got a couple of options.
[28:31.640 --> 28:33.920]  I'm gonna let out something that I have never released before.
[28:33.920 --> 28:35.900]  It'll be a very limited release.
[28:35.900 --> 28:38.260]  Before anybody gets too excited,
[28:38.260 --> 28:40.480]  it will not be the star dog to Arise.
[28:40.500 --> 28:42.620]  It will not be the Durban Poison to Arise.
[28:42.620 --> 28:45.780]  There are a couple of other options that it will be,
[28:45.780 --> 28:47.420]  but it will not be the two I just mentioned.
[28:47.420 --> 28:48.740]  So don't get too excited.
[28:48.740 --> 28:50.340]  Those will be coming out in the future.
[28:50.340 --> 28:51.620]  They need to get thoroughly tested,
[28:51.620 --> 28:52.900]  but it'll be something new.
[28:52.900 --> 28:55.060]  It'll be something that'll be awesome.

[28:55.900 --> 28:58.180]  So you'll get a free five pack of something brand new,
[28:58.180 --> 28:59.260]  so far unreleased.
[28:59.260 --> 29:01.100]  This will be your first shot at some new shit.
[29:01.100 --> 29:05.100]  So four packs for 120 bucks plus a free five pack
[29:05.100 --> 29:07.040]  plus options to get more freebies.
[29:07.040 --> 29:09.540]  Check them out at dankseed.store.

[29:19.840 --> 29:22.640]  you can do so by going to patreon.com
[29:22.640 --> 29:24.560]  slash growfromyourheart.

[29:33.320 --> 29:36.240]  That helps me keep the show free for everybody else.
[29:36.240 --> 29:37.780]  What I'm asking for help with
[29:37.780 --> 29:39.640]  is to pay for the cost of my website.
[29:39.640 --> 29:41.000]  My MacBook that I record on
[29:41.000 --> 29:42.960]  is starting to take a little bit of a poop on me.
[29:42.960 --> 29:45.120]  So I need to replace this before too long.
[29:45.120 --> 29:46.480]  Sometimes I have guests on the show.
[29:46.480 --> 29:48.980]  And when I do, I have bottles of water for everybody.
[29:48.980 --> 29:51.720]  I have these microphone covers that I replace occasionally.
[29:51.720 --> 29:54.160]  I've got a lot of equipment that I have to keep up here.
[29:54.160 --> 29:55.160]  I'm not trying to beg.
[29:55.160 --> 29:56.480]  I would just appreciate support
[29:56.480 --> 29:58.360]  from the folks that can support me.

[30:02.680 --> 30:03.860]  It is from my heart.
[30:03.860 --> 30:04.840]  It is for you.
[30:04.840 --> 30:06.840]  There are just some people that would like to contribute.
[30:06.860 --> 30:09.340]  And I like to have a way for that to happen.
[30:09.340 --> 30:12.020]  Also, I want to give a huge shout out to everybody
[30:12.020 --> 30:14.660]  who has contributed to the Patreon campaign.
[30:14.660 --> 30:15.980]  Thank you.
[30:15.980 --> 30:17.260]  All right, Podcast World.
[30:17.260 --> 30:19.020]  That's all I've got for you for this Monday.
[30:19.020 --> 30:22.280]  I'll be back Thursday with a Thursday quickie episode.
[30:22.280 --> 30:24.060]  I want to give a huge, huge shout out
[30:24.060 --> 30:25.760]  to my brother, Joseph Israel.
[30:25.760 --> 30:28.100]  And until next time, take a fat dab
[30:28.100 --> 30:29.860]  and give your mom a hug for me.
