[00:00.060 --> 00:05.740]  Hey everybody this is Doug Benson and you're listening to the Grow From Your
[00:05.740 --> 00:11.780]  Heart podcast hosted by my buddy Rasta Jeff.
[00:32.980 --> 00:39.580]  Yeah welcome back podcast world I'm your host Rasta Jeff this is episode 802 of
[00:39.580 --> 00:43.420]  the Grow From Your Heart podcast. I've got a great show planned for us. In this
[00:43.420 --> 00:46.860]  episode I'm going to give away free seeds. That's right I've teamed up with
[00:46.860 --> 00:52.060]  our friends at seedsherenow.com to give away free iRegenetic seeds. Hang out
[00:52.060 --> 00:55.460]  we'll talk more about the free seeds later in this episode. I do want to
[00:55.460 --> 00:59.340]  remind you that team iRegenetics will be at the Dude Grows Cup in LaPorte
[00:59.340 --> 01:04.940]  Colorado on June 3rd. Make sure you check out dgccup.com for all the info. Grab
[01:04.940 --> 01:09.580]  those tickets because the event is almost sold out. Also make sure you check
[01:09.580 --> 01:13.900]  out the fresh drop and restock at iRedirect.com. That's right Orange
[01:13.900 --> 01:19.180]  Gasm is back in stock at iRedirect.com. Go grab some Orange Gasm, get some Lemon
[01:19.180 --> 01:22.220]  Jeffrey, get some Golden Goat, some Bubble Goat. There should be some
[01:22.220 --> 01:26.100]  chemical cocktail available and of course every order does come with free
[01:26.100 --> 01:31.180]  seeds at iRedirect.com. Go see what's in stock. Grab those beans before they do
[01:31.180 --> 01:35.020]  sell out. Alright I think that is all of the business we need to cover here at
[01:35.020 --> 01:38.300]  the start of the podcast. I do have a bunch of great messages here right in
[01:38.300 --> 01:42.140]  front of me. Let's jump into our favorite portion of the show. Let's jump into the
[01:42.140 --> 01:46.700]  question and answer portion of today's podcast. This first question did come
[01:46.700 --> 01:50.340]  from the grow help tab on the iRegenetics website. If you go to my
[01:50.340 --> 01:55.020]  website iRegenetics.com on the top there's a row of tabs. One of them does
[01:55.020 --> 01:58.940]  say grow help or grow questions. Click on that tab. We'll ask you a couple of
[01:58.940 --> 02:02.660]  questions. You'll get the opportunity to type in your grow question and of course
[02:02.660 --> 02:07.100]  if I read your question on the podcast you do win a free pack of seeds. This
[02:07.100 --> 02:10.460]  first message came from our friend who wants to be known as Ryo Tan.
[02:10.620 --> 02:15.020]  Congratulations Ryo Tan you have won a free pack of iRegenetic seeds. Please
[02:15.020 --> 02:18.380]  send me a follow-up email with your real name and your shipping address and I'd
[02:18.380 --> 02:21.860]  be more than happy to get a pack of seeds in the mail to you. Let's keep
[02:21.860 --> 02:26.220]  going. The message does go a little bit like this. It says hello Rasta Jeff.
[02:26.220 --> 02:30.820]  Hello my friend Ryo Tan. Great to meet you. It says are there environmental
[02:30.820 --> 02:35.720]  conditions that can induce a female cannabis plant to produce pollen? I like
[02:35.720 --> 02:39.300]  your show. Keep up the good work from your friend Ryo. Oh I've been saying that
[02:39.300 --> 02:43.500]  wrong that's Rowy Tan. R-O-I-T-A-N. I apologize for pronouncing that
[02:43.500 --> 02:48.060]  incorrectly the first time. I was doing the I first. It is Rowy Tan I think is
[02:48.060 --> 02:50.860]  how I would say that. Thank you for the great message bro. This is a great
[02:50.860 --> 02:55.200]  question. Are there conditions environmental conditions and or factors
[02:55.200 --> 02:59.460]  that will induce a female cannabis plant to produce pollen? Now this is a great
[02:59.460 --> 03:02.540]  question but it puts a lot of thoughts in my mind and sends me down a lot of
[03:02.540 --> 03:06.660]  different avenues of thinking. If the female cannabis plant is putting off
[03:06.900 --> 03:12.060]  pollen it has probably got some sort of intersex trait or it has gone way too
[03:12.060 --> 03:16.500]  long in the flowering cycle. So let me back up. I say this a lot of times. Not
[03:16.500 --> 03:20.460]  everybody listens to every episode. Cannabis's main goal. The cannabis
[03:20.460 --> 03:23.820]  plant's number one goal. We think it's to get us high right? We love that. That's
[03:23.820 --> 03:27.820]  just a side effect of cannabis. Cannabis's number one goal. It's whole
[03:27.820 --> 03:32.100]  goal in life for that plant is to reproduce. The female plants want to
[03:32.100 --> 03:35.580]  receive pollen so that they can make seeds so they can continue their
[03:35.580 --> 03:40.100]  generation next year. And just like you the male plants whole goal in life is to
[03:40.100 --> 03:44.500]  reproduce. That male plant wants to get nice and tall drop pollen on to some
[03:44.500 --> 03:48.060]  ladies that way the lady will receive the pollen. She'll produce seeds. She'll
[03:48.060 --> 03:51.620]  drop the seeds into the earth. That male and female plant will die at the end of
[03:51.620 --> 03:55.140]  the season but guess what next year they get to continue their genetics through
[03:55.140 --> 03:58.660]  the seeds that they made and those plants get to keep going. That is
[03:58.660 --> 04:03.420]  cannabis's main goal is to reproduce and survive for next year. Now in our grow
[04:03.540 --> 04:07.180]  rooms we are preventing the seeds from happening. One of our main goals is to
[04:07.180 --> 04:10.900]  stop the seed production from happening. We do that by eliminating the male
[04:10.900 --> 04:14.300]  plants and not having any pollen in the room. Now here's another thing I'm sure
[04:14.300 --> 04:19.260]  I've said on this podcast before. It is the Jurassic Park theory. Nature always
[04:19.260 --> 04:24.020]  finds a way. So even if we do remove those male plants from that grow room,
[04:24.020 --> 04:28.660]  remove that pollen from the room, given the right conditions, given enough time,
[04:28.660 --> 04:32.620]  that female plant may produce seeds. Now I'm not sure that that plant is going to
[04:32.620 --> 04:36.700]  produce pollen specifically. If pollen is coming from that female plant that
[04:36.700 --> 04:39.980]  means we've got a male flower on that female plant which means that now that
[04:39.980 --> 04:44.220]  plant is possibly labeled intersex depending on how long we let it flower.
[04:44.220 --> 04:48.940]  If you let almost any plant go for long enough, not not your hazes, those hazes
[04:48.940 --> 04:53.180]  those long 16 week flowering plants, take those out of this equation. If you take a
[04:53.180 --> 04:57.740]  normal 9 or 10 week 8 or 9 10 week flowering hybrid and you let it go for
[04:57.740 --> 05:02.340]  16 weeks that plant will start to show intersex traits and it possibly will
[05:02.340 --> 05:07.300]  produce pollen if not just seed itself. So there are some conditions that can
[05:07.300 --> 05:11.540]  occur in our grow room or even outside that will encourage a female plant to
[05:11.540 --> 05:15.800]  try to reproduce on its own and that's if it does rotalization which is by
[05:15.800 --> 05:19.540]  going too long in the flowering phase. Eventually that plant will just produce
[05:19.540 --> 05:24.300]  its own flowers or sometimes going too long or messing up certain environmental
[05:24.300 --> 05:27.820]  factors or feeds or light. We'll talk more about that in a second. Some of
[05:27.820 --> 05:31.340]  those things will encourage that plant to show intersex traits and those
[05:31.340 --> 05:35.860]  intersex flowers, those male flowers can pollinate that female plant. Now the
[05:35.860 --> 05:39.420]  question was are there environmental conditions? Yes, let's talk about some of
[05:39.420 --> 05:43.500]  the environmental conditions that can cause, I don't know if we want to call
[05:43.500 --> 05:47.060]  this intersex, I don't know if we want to lead up to rotalization. There are a lot
[05:47.060 --> 05:49.940]  of options here but let's talk about some of the environmental conditions
[05:49.940 --> 05:54.820]  that will cause, I'm gonna say seeds in your plant because maybe not pollen but
[05:54.820 --> 05:57.900]  these are some things that will cause seeds in the plant because pollen is
[05:57.900 --> 06:04.220]  more rare but seeds are not uncommon in cannabis. So the plants could just be
[06:04.220 --> 06:07.700]  intersex, they could be intersex, that could just be the plant's genetics.
[06:07.700 --> 06:11.100]  Sometimes a plant has male and female chromosomes in there, it's an intersex
[06:11.100 --> 06:15.780]  plant, it will create seeds on its own. That is a factor, not environmental,
[06:15.780 --> 06:19.340]  sometimes the environment will bring it out but sometimes it's just the genetics.
[06:19.340 --> 06:24.740]  Sometimes light interruptions in the dark period can cause intersex traits
[06:24.780 --> 06:29.380]  which will lead to seeds. So if your plant was on 12-12 for a couple of weeks
[06:29.380 --> 06:33.540]  and one day your timer failed and it stayed on for 24 hours, that's a good
[06:33.540 --> 06:37.740]  possibility of getting seeds in that room. Over and under feeding our plants
[06:37.740 --> 06:42.740]  early in the flowering phase can also lead to seeds or intersex traits. Things
[06:42.740 --> 06:47.460]  like over feeding, under feeding, over watering, under watering, also high and
[06:47.460 --> 06:51.460]  low temperatures can definitely lead to the intersex trait which will lead to
[06:51.620 --> 06:55.860]  seeds in our product. Too high and too low of humidity can lead to intersex or
[06:55.860 --> 06:59.340]  seeds in the product. Another method that I've talked about earlier on this
[06:59.340 --> 07:03.820]  podcast is called rotalization. What that is, like I said before, if we take a nine
[07:03.820 --> 07:08.300]  or ten week flowering cannabis plant and we stretch it out to 15 or 16 weeks,
[07:08.300 --> 07:13.060]  eventually that plant will produce its own seeds if we don't cut it down. That
[07:13.060 --> 07:17.300]  plant wants to survive, its whole goal is to make seeds. That female plant's just
[07:17.300 --> 07:21.420]  going, I got to make seeds, I got to make seeds and like I said before, nature does
[07:21.420 --> 07:26.500]  find a way. So there are many environmental things that can cause this.
[07:26.500 --> 07:30.780]  Most of them are going to be swings, inconsistencies and swings. If you've got
[07:30.780 --> 07:34.420]  something happening regularly and then something goes wildly out of control,
[07:34.420 --> 07:38.340]  that's most of the time when we do see these problems in the grow. So you're
[07:38.340 --> 07:42.740]  asking about pollen. Pollen is less common than seeds. To get pollen, most of
[07:42.740 --> 07:46.100]  the time you've got to do reversals. If you're getting pollen, you've probably
[07:46.100 --> 07:51.140]  got an intersex plant and a lot of times, a laden flower, those male flowers that
[07:51.140 --> 07:54.220]  pop up in a female plant, those are mostly sterile. You got to be more
[07:54.220 --> 07:57.780]  concerned about the early intersex flowers. Those are what are going to
[07:57.780 --> 08:01.820]  produce pollen most of the time. Now here's a random rant attached to this. A
[08:01.820 --> 08:06.020]  lot of people are going to say, if that plant produces pollen and you get seeds,
[08:06.020 --> 08:10.580]  those seeds will all be females. Guess what? That is not 100% accurate. If you
[08:10.580 --> 08:13.980]  have a plant in your grow room that was a female plant, we thought it was a
[08:13.980 --> 08:17.620]  female and pollen came from that plant. There's an issue with that plant.
[08:17.740 --> 08:21.500]  Whatever plant it seeded, it's going to produce seeds. Those seeds are going to
[08:21.500 --> 08:26.140]  carry that potential problem. However those seeds were formed, however that
[08:26.140 --> 08:28.860]  pollen happened, that's an issue in my opinion because we should not have
[08:28.860 --> 08:33.500]  pollen in the flower room. Those seeds possibly do contain that problematic
[08:33.500 --> 08:37.660]  gene. So if your grow room produced seeds and you do not have any true males in
[08:37.660 --> 08:41.500]  that room or you did not reverse anything, it is a very inaccurate
[08:41.500 --> 08:46.340]  assumption to believe that all of those seeds will be female. There is no reason
[08:46.340 --> 08:50.300]  to believe that those seeds will be female. Those are possibly potentially
[08:50.300 --> 08:54.380]  problematic seeds. They came from a problematic plant. So keep that in mind.
[08:54.380 --> 08:57.100]  Now let me go back and make sure I answered this question. I think we
[08:57.100 --> 09:00.820]  covered it. Are there environmental conditions that will induce a female to
[09:00.820 --> 09:04.620]  produce pollen? So pollen isn't going to be as common as my final answer, but
[09:04.620 --> 09:08.620]  seeds are definitely more likely. Intersex plants are very likely. And once
[09:08.620 --> 09:12.740]  again, a lot of those things are caused by over and under feeding, out of control
[09:12.740 --> 09:18.500]  temperature, drastic swings, and of course dark period interruptions. Alright
[09:18.500 --> 09:21.940]  I feel like I rambled on long enough about this question. My buddy Rowey Tan,
[09:21.940 --> 09:25.300]  thank you for the great question. Of course I do owe you a free pack of seeds
[09:25.300 --> 09:29.380]  so please do send me a follow-up email with your shipping address and please do
[09:29.380 --> 09:33.700]  include a real name because I have to hand deliver these boxes to the post
[09:33.700 --> 09:38.140]  office and I don't like putting like Joe Smokes fat blunts at hotmail.com as
[09:38.140 --> 09:41.300]  your name. That shit doesn't look good. Please give me a real name and a safe
[09:41.420 --> 09:45.740]  address to send your seeds to you. Alright I've got another great question
[09:45.740 --> 09:50.180]  here. This one came from our buddy Grumpy Toad. No need to be so grumpy bro. Cheer
[09:50.180 --> 09:54.700]  it up. It's a toad's life. This question says, I've heard you discuss purple
[09:54.700 --> 09:58.300]  petioles a couple of times. I'd like to get your thoughts on how to prevent them
[09:58.300 --> 10:03.540]  right from square one. Alright so let's back up a little bit. In several episodes
[10:03.540 --> 10:07.340]  when I talk about defoliation, I talk about pulling off any leaf which has got
[10:07.340 --> 10:11.300]  a purple petiole. That's the long stem. So you got those big leaves. There are
[10:11.300 --> 10:14.420]  short leaves on your plant. Little leaves. And you got bigger leaves with the long
[10:14.420 --> 10:18.100]  stem coming out of the bud. That long stem is the petiole. I've heard it called
[10:18.100 --> 10:21.900]  the petiole. Today we're gonna say petiole because that's just how I
[10:21.900 --> 10:26.180]  fucking say it. But I always talk about pulling off any leaves with purple
[10:26.180 --> 10:30.780]  petioles in a commercial grow. I do heavy defoliation in a commercial grow
[10:30.780 --> 10:35.260]  facility because in my experience, in my opinion, those big leaves are where a lot
[10:35.260 --> 10:38.740]  of the problems begin. That's where your powdery mildew happens. That's where the
[10:38.740 --> 10:42.420]  bugs like to hang out. If you're removing those big leaves, that's just less
[10:42.420 --> 10:46.860]  camping spots for powdery mildew and for bugs. And also then we allow more airflow.
[10:46.860 --> 10:50.500]  We allow more light penetration. It's just beneficial in many different ways.
[10:50.500 --> 10:54.540]  The reason I say and train people to take off those leaves with the purple
[10:54.540 --> 10:58.220]  petioles is because those are usually the older bigger leaves. It's real
[10:58.220 --> 11:02.260]  obvious. It's a real easy training technique. That's why I do it. If I tell a
[11:02.260 --> 11:06.180]  bunch of guys or gals that are going into the grow, take off all of the purple
[11:06.180 --> 11:09.780]  petiole leaves. That's a really easy thing to identify and they can take it off.
[11:09.780 --> 11:12.420]  They don't have to come keep asking me, should I take this leaf? Should I take
[11:12.420 --> 11:16.340]  this one? Is that petiole purple? Pull that fucker off. Let's keep moving. So
[11:16.340 --> 11:19.740]  that's just a training technique and kind of a training method for me. The
[11:19.740 --> 11:22.980]  reason that works, like I said, is because those are usually the bigger older
[11:22.980 --> 11:26.180]  leaves. Those are gonna be the leaves that are blocking the light. Those are
[11:26.180 --> 11:30.020]  gonna be the leaves that are also going to attract and house those bugs and
[11:30.020 --> 11:34.740]  problems should they show up. So that is mainly why I pull those big leaves off.
[11:34.740 --> 11:39.820]  Not always is there a problem with those big leaves. This person is asking, how do
[11:39.820 --> 11:44.540]  I prevent that from square one? Thanks. I love the podcast and the genetics as well.
[11:44.540 --> 11:50.940]  Peace from Grumpy Toad. Now sometimes those purple petioles are
[11:50.940 --> 11:55.820]  unpreventable. Sometimes that is just genetics. Sometimes your plant is going
[11:55.820 --> 12:01.340]  to do that. Girl Scout cookies and cookies crosses oftentimes are going to
[12:01.340 --> 12:06.220]  make purple petioles if you grow them correctly. When my Girl Scout cookies
[12:06.220 --> 12:10.980]  gets black leaves and looks real dark and the purple petioles are real almost
[12:10.980 --> 12:15.120]  burgundy and maroon, that was when the Girl Scout cookies flowers tasted the
[12:15.120 --> 12:19.780]  best. The pH was low, the EC was low, and those plants were just barely eating,
[12:19.780 --> 12:24.220]  almost starving, but they tasted so good when you smoked them. So those always
[12:24.380 --> 12:28.020]  made purple petioles. So that was kind of a desirable trait and I think that was
[12:28.020 --> 12:31.620]  sort of genetics. I've got a couple of plants, the machine. There's a phenotype
[12:31.620 --> 12:35.180]  of the machine that no matter what you do, the petioles will be purple. It's not
[12:35.180 --> 12:38.300]  a problem. It's just a pigment in the plant. So it's not always going to be
[12:38.300 --> 12:42.460]  something you can prevent and it's not a problem. Purple petioles are not a big
[12:42.460 --> 12:45.900]  deal. Like I said before, it's just a training technique. It was something I
[12:45.900 --> 12:50.420]  was using to show the crew how to defoliate quite quickly in the room. Now
[12:50.580 --> 12:56.060]  things you can do to monitor and prevent these purple petioles is temperature and
[12:56.060 --> 13:00.140]  nutrition are mainly the causes of the purple petioles. Is it getting cold in
[13:00.140 --> 13:03.620]  the room? Are you feeding the plants enough phosphorus and potassium? Those
[13:03.620 --> 13:08.020]  are going to be the things that lead to that purple. Also, too much light can
[13:08.020 --> 13:11.460]  purple up these petioles a little bit. If you've got too much light in the room,
[13:11.580 --> 13:15.700]  that is one of the things that can be causing the purple petioles. Is your
[13:16.060 --> 13:21.100]  water cold? Are your plants sitting in cold water? Perhaps you watered earlier
[13:21.100 --> 13:25.300]  today. So the way that I water, I've got a, sometimes it's a three, sometimes
[13:25.300 --> 13:28.700]  it's a seven gallon pot. Let's just say a three gallon pot today. I've got a
[13:28.700 --> 13:32.620]  three gallon pot. It sits in a saucer. If I were to go out of town for the
[13:32.620 --> 13:36.820]  weekend, I would water that three gallon pot until it ran off and halfway filled
[13:36.820 --> 13:40.540]  my saucer. That would buy me an extra day or two of watering. I only do this to
[13:40.540 --> 13:43.540]  bigger plants. They're not going to get root bound. There's no problem. But this
[13:43.540 --> 13:46.980]  is how I buy an extra day or two to go enjoy my weekend. I overwater that
[13:46.980 --> 13:51.460]  saucer a little bit. If that plant is sitting on the floor and that water gets
[13:51.460 --> 13:55.540]  real cold, that will make everything turn purple. Your leaves will get purple.
[13:55.540 --> 13:59.860]  The petioles will get purple. That cold water is going to cause purpleness in
[13:59.860 --> 14:03.780]  that grow. So is there, is the water cold? Are the plants sitting on the cold
[14:03.780 --> 14:07.700]  floor? Are you feeding it cold water? Are they sitting in cold water? That could
[14:07.700 --> 14:11.940]  be something leading to your purpling. But like I've said a couple of times,
[14:12.180 --> 14:15.540]  purple is not always an issue. I'm not taking off the purple leaves because
[14:15.540 --> 14:19.140]  it's a problem. I'm taking them off because it's a simple training technique
[14:19.140 --> 14:23.940]  and I like to do semi-heavy defoliation. All right, my dude Grumpy Toad, I hope I
[14:23.940 --> 14:27.380]  answered your question. I don't always remove those purple petioles because
[14:27.380 --> 14:31.300]  they are a problem. A lot of times I'm just removing those as a preventative
[14:31.300 --> 14:35.860]  measure because I do like to do such heavy defoliation. My friend Grumpy Toad,
[14:35.860 --> 14:39.540]  I do owe you a free pack of iRi genetic seeds because I read your message here
[14:39.860 --> 14:43.620]  on the podcast. Please be sure to send me your address and once again, do
[14:43.620 --> 14:47.060]  include a real name. I can't ship a package to Grumpy Toad that may get
[14:47.060 --> 14:50.420]  noticed and they're going to look at me silly at the post office. All right,
[14:50.420 --> 14:53.460]  let's keep moving because I've got another great question here in front of
[14:53.460 --> 14:58.420]  me. This one came from our friend Lazy. Big shout out to our buddy Lazy. This
[14:58.420 --> 15:02.660]  one is a general grow question and it goes a lot like this. It says, yo Rasta
[15:02.660 --> 15:06.500]  Jeff, what's up Lazy? Good to meet you. It says, I hope all is well with you my
[15:06.500 --> 15:09.460]  friend. Things are good bro. I'm hanging out with you guys recording a podcast.
[15:10.020 --> 15:13.380]  Dogs are chilling, passed out. I'm good and stoned. It is finally cooling down.
[15:14.100 --> 15:17.140]  It was super hot today. It's too early to start bitching about the heat. It's
[15:17.140 --> 15:20.020]  only going to get worse. Let's keep going. It says, I'm currently growing
[15:20.020 --> 15:25.540]  lemon Jeffrey and I'm growing with Gaia Green Organic Dry Amendments. Big
[15:25.540 --> 15:30.820]  shout out to Gaia Green Organic Dry Amendments. That's good shit. It says,
[15:30.820 --> 15:35.060]  the garden is currently in week four of flower. I used compost teas yesterday
[15:35.060 --> 15:39.300]  and I noticed a couple of leaves are drying and getting a little bit crispy.
[15:39.300 --> 15:41.860]  This could be a lot of things. I wish I had a picture here that would have
[15:41.860 --> 15:46.740]  helped a lot, but we'll figure this out. It says, I'm not sure what causes this.
[15:46.740 --> 15:50.660]  Maybe the fan is drying it out. So far, it's just a couple of leaves on the
[15:50.660 --> 15:55.060]  side where the fan is, but she is starting to smell amazing. Thank you for
[15:55.060 --> 16:00.660]  all you do. Any and any advice you can give bro. This is a very common thing
[16:00.660 --> 16:05.060]  that I see when people have grow questions or grow issues. When you see
[16:05.060 --> 16:09.380]  something that you think is probably causing the problem, follow your gut, go
[16:09.380 --> 16:13.380]  with your intuition, trust yourself, trust your instincts from the things that
[16:13.380 --> 16:18.020]  you have said. It's the fan. It is probably that fan. And you said that in
[16:18.020 --> 16:21.300]  the message. So you're, you've got to trust yourself. You've got, you're smart
[16:21.300 --> 16:24.900]  enough. You're confident enough and you know what you're talking about. So, uh,
[16:24.900 --> 16:28.500]  rely on your gut. Your gut was right. This was the fan. It was a good idea to
[16:28.500 --> 16:32.260]  send me a message and double check, but this sounds like it is the fan. Let's
[16:32.260 --> 16:37.220]  talk about what happens when you put too much wind on your ganja plants. I
[16:37.220 --> 16:41.700]  think the leaves start to get a papery and dried up texture. They'll get kind of
[16:41.700 --> 16:44.580]  papery is the best way I can put it. They should be supple, right? They should
[16:44.580 --> 16:47.940]  have some juice to them, but instead of the fans been hitting them, they'll get
[16:47.940 --> 16:50.820]  this sound to them. You know what I mean? That, that, that they'll get that
[16:50.820 --> 16:53.860]  going on and they shouldn't sound like that. They should sound like soft and
[16:53.860 --> 16:56.980]  supple and moist. So if they're starting to get crispy because the wind is
[16:56.980 --> 17:00.580]  blowing on them, that is definitely from the fan. If they're turning yellow in
[17:00.580 --> 17:05.700]  that spot, curling up, starting to fall off, that is from the fan. Also, this
[17:05.700 --> 17:09.780]  could be because it is too hot or too dry in your grow room, which also could
[17:09.780 --> 17:13.860]  be from the fan. You're just drying up that area and the plan is just going,
[17:13.860 --> 17:16.980]  bro, I don't know what to do. And it's trying to rescue the rest of the plant
[17:16.980 --> 17:20.900]  and move the moisture around and sacrifice those couple of leaves. It also
[17:20.900 --> 17:27.140]  could be overfed, but bro, when you said right away, it's the fan, I'm just
[17:27.140 --> 17:30.020]  going to go with you and believe that it is the fan. It could also be too much
[17:30.100 --> 17:33.540]  light. It could be a lot of factors, but since I don't have any photos in here
[17:33.540 --> 17:36.740]  and you said the fan right away, we're going to say it's the fan. So if your
[17:36.740 --> 17:40.740]  leaves start to get like a leathery or papery texture, they don't look juicy
[17:40.740 --> 17:44.100]  like they used to, and you haven't overfed or done anything strange and you
[17:44.100 --> 17:48.580]  got a fan blowing right on them, it is probably the fan. I like to have a fan
[17:48.580 --> 17:51.300]  going in the grow room at all times. That's a good idea. We want to keep the
[17:51.300 --> 17:54.660]  air moving. Bugs don't want to build homes where there's a bunch of wind
[17:54.660 --> 17:58.020]  moving. If you got a fan coming around every couple of seconds, spider mites
[17:58.020 --> 18:00.420]  are going to go, bro, this sucks. Let's go somewhere else. They'll go build
[18:00.420 --> 18:04.660]  somewhere else. Also, I've seen spider mites use the fan to move from one plant
[18:04.660 --> 18:07.060]  to another. So if you've already got them, you're just going to move them
[18:07.060 --> 18:10.980]  around with that. But what we really want, the goal is to have all of the
[18:10.980 --> 18:14.500]  leaves just rustling. We want them moving. We don't want them waving around
[18:14.500 --> 18:17.860]  like the wacky, wild, inflatable tube man in front of the car dealership, but
[18:17.860 --> 18:20.900]  you just want them moving. You want the leaves, every leaf should just be
[18:20.900 --> 18:24.660]  moving around and rustling, not all at the same time. If your fan oscillates,
[18:24.660 --> 18:27.380]  make sure that it hits this part of the room and then comes back and hits that
[18:27.380 --> 18:30.580]  part and then hits that part. If you need more than one fan, put more than
[18:30.580 --> 18:34.900]  one fan in there. Something I want to talk about with multiple fans. I had a
[18:34.900 --> 18:39.620]  friend who would try to set up multiple fans in the room to blow and oscillate
[18:39.620 --> 18:43.780]  exactly the same. It looked really cool. It was a neat idea. It looked super
[18:43.780 --> 18:48.820]  organized. It was really nice for the OCD and the ADD, but I don't think that
[18:48.820 --> 18:53.540]  was most beneficial for the room. What we were trying to do is mix the air. All
[18:53.540 --> 18:57.060]  he was doing, what I think was happening, I think if we would have blown smoke in
[18:57.060 --> 19:01.140]  the room, we would have just saw smoke move around the room in a pattern. We
[19:01.140 --> 19:05.140]  want the air to mix. We don't want to just move the air around. We want to mix
[19:05.140 --> 19:08.420]  the air so that we don't get microclimates. If you just move the air
[19:08.420 --> 19:12.020]  around, you're going to have pockets of hot, pockets of cold just moving around.
[19:12.020 --> 19:16.100]  We want to mix that air together. So don't just get your fans organized to
[19:16.100 --> 19:19.780]  blow like this. You're just going to create a wind tunnel. We want a wind
[19:19.780 --> 19:24.740]  blender, not just a tunnel. So that's my advice for that. But my dude Lazy, it
[19:24.740 --> 19:28.260]  does sound like your main issue is just that those fans are blowing. That fan is
[19:28.260 --> 19:31.700]  blowing on those leaves and drying them out. Just imagine if you went and sat in
[19:31.700 --> 19:35.540]  front of a high powered fan all day or just a couple of hours. How long would it
[19:35.540 --> 19:39.060]  take for the side of your face where the fan is just to start feeling kind of
[19:39.060 --> 19:42.900]  weird? You ever go to a sporting event or go fishing or just go to a concert, be
[19:42.900 --> 19:46.740]  outside all day facing one direction and the sun is just hitting you from one
[19:46.740 --> 19:49.780]  side, the fan is hitting you from another, the wind is hitting you from that side.
[19:49.780 --> 19:52.580]  At the end of the day, that whole side just feels fucked up and wind burnt and
[19:52.580 --> 19:56.180]  sun burnt. That's what you're doing to the plants, my dude. So either rotate the
[19:56.180 --> 20:00.020]  plants a little bit or turn down that fan. If you rotate the plants, do it every
[20:00.020 --> 20:04.100]  hour or so, just a little bit so you're not hitting the same exact spot. But my
[20:04.100 --> 20:08.260]  advice, my recommendation would be either to pull the fan back or turn that bad
[20:08.260 --> 20:11.300]  bitch down or turn it off for a little while occasionally. Just give those
[20:11.300 --> 20:15.460]  plants a little bit of a rest. All right, my dude Lazy, I do want to thank you for
[20:15.460 --> 20:19.220]  the great message. Once again, please do send me your address because you win a
