[00:00.000 --> 00:04.560]  Welcome to the show, cannabis community. It's time for episode 356 of the Grow
[00:04.560 --> 00:08.200]  From Your Heart podcast. Thank you for joining me. This episode is brought to
[00:08.200 --> 00:12.200]  you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company. If you need new regular or
[00:12.200 --> 00:16.460]  feminized seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company
[00:16.460 --> 00:21.800]  and you can find them at dankseed.store. You guys know I like to start these
[00:21.800 --> 00:25.520]  shows off by letting you know what I'm dabbing. I just took a big fat dab of
[00:25.520 --> 00:30.160]  some coffee nectar from our friends at Green Dot Labs. This is Alien Kush and
[00:30.160 --> 00:35.240]  Alien OG. It's described as dark roast coffee and watermelon candy. I've talked
[00:35.240 --> 00:38.720]  about this one on the show before. It absolutely does have that coffee flavor.
[00:38.720 --> 00:42.720]  Then the lingering aftertaste is a little bit of coffee with that sweet
[00:42.720 --> 00:46.400]  watermelon flavor. That is an accurate description there. So big shout out to
[00:46.400 --> 00:51.440]  our friends at Green Dot Labs and excellent work on the coffee nectar. This
[00:51.440 --> 00:55.240]  episode is going to be another grow lesson. This will be the fifth lesson in
[00:55.240 --> 00:59.920]  a long series of grow lessons I've got planned for you. This lesson will be more
[00:59.920 --> 01:04.200]  about selecting our equipment. So at this point in the grow lessons we should have
[01:04.200 --> 01:08.600]  a good goal for our grow. We should have a good place for our grow planned out. We
[01:08.600 --> 01:12.240]  should have a good idea of the equipment that we need and also you should have a
[01:12.240 --> 01:16.560]  good idea of how to set up all of that gear. Now that we've got a good grow room
[01:16.560 --> 01:21.280]  running, let's talk about pots and soil and then we'll work our way into our
[01:21.360 --> 01:25.440]  nutrient options. When it comes to selecting containers for our plants
[01:25.440 --> 01:30.800]  we've got a lot of options. We can select net pots, we can select plastic nursery
[01:30.800 --> 01:35.960]  pots, we can use fabric pots. Also there are waffle pots also known as root pots
[01:35.960 --> 01:40.880]  available. I've seen people get various sizes of bags of soil and cut the top
[01:40.880 --> 01:45.120]  off a bag of soil. You can pack that soil down into the bag really tight and you
[01:45.120 --> 01:49.440]  can grow your plant directly in there if that's what you want to do. All of these
[01:49.520 --> 01:54.240]  methods have their pros and cons. The main thing to focus on when selecting
[01:54.240 --> 02:00.440]  your pots is drainage. Your pots need holes on the bottom. We're going to be
[02:00.440 --> 02:04.160]  watering and feeding our plants a lot of water. If there's nowhere for that excess
[02:04.160 --> 02:08.000]  water to go it's just gonna build up in your pot. You're gonna create a mud puddle.
[02:08.000 --> 02:12.360]  Your plant will drown. The roots will drown in there. Your plant will die. We
[02:12.360 --> 02:16.360]  need plenty of holes for drainage in the bottom of our pot no matter what type of
[02:16.600 --> 02:21.120]  pot we select. The net pots I talked about those are mostly holes. Your
[02:21.120 --> 02:25.840]  nursery pots they should come with holes already in them. The fabric pots they
[02:25.840 --> 02:29.720]  provide plenty of drainage by being a fabric pot. The waffle pot does the same
[02:29.720 --> 02:33.240]  thing. And you guys what I'm saying a waffle pot I mean those air pots it
[02:33.240 --> 02:36.720]  looks like a waffle maker with a bunch of holes in it and sometimes it's got
[02:36.720 --> 02:40.720]  rivets that you can undo and you can unroll the pot and take the root ball
[02:40.720 --> 02:45.200]  out and you can manipulate the root ball and then put the pot back on or you can
[02:45.200 --> 02:48.280]  up pot it at that time but that's what I mean when I'm saying the waffle pots
[02:48.280 --> 02:52.800]  they're air pots. It looks like somebody rolled them out with a waffle maker and
[02:52.800 --> 02:55.760]  then made a pot out of it. You'll see those when you go to the grocery store
[02:55.760 --> 02:59.360]  and you go shopping for pots you'll know what I'm talking about. You can use
[02:59.360 --> 03:03.440]  whatever container you've got available to you. A lot of people like to go buy a
[03:03.440 --> 03:07.240]  bunch of five gallon buckets. A lot of people like to recycle some sort of
[03:07.240 --> 03:11.640]  container that they use frequently. That is fine as long as you make some
[03:12.000 --> 03:17.360]  holes. Quite often I start my baby plants whether seeds or clones in beer cups.
[03:17.360 --> 03:21.480]  When football season starts or during the Super Bowl those beer cups go on
[03:21.480 --> 03:27.120]  sale super cheap. Stock up. Get yourself a few bags of beer cups. Then I stack them
[03:27.120 --> 03:30.920]  up about eight or ten tall and I use a drill and I take a power drill with the
[03:30.920 --> 03:34.640]  long bit and I poke a hole right through the bottom of the center of eight to ten
[03:34.640 --> 03:39.200]  cups at a time. I just did 20 cups and they've got holes in them. They've
[03:39.200 --> 03:42.840]  got one big drainage hole. Now I'll also go through and make one or two more
[03:42.840 --> 03:46.400]  holes on the side of each cup after that. So I've got three solid drainage holes
[03:46.400 --> 03:49.640]  in a beer cup. That is plenty of drainage. You're not gonna get any root
[03:49.640 --> 03:53.280]  rot. You're not gonna get stagnant water in the bottom there. So that's a great
[03:53.280 --> 03:58.200]  way to segue. What are we going to segue into? Let's work our way into pot size.
[03:58.200 --> 04:02.880]  We've got plenty of drainage. Now we need a pot that is the appropriate size for
[04:02.880 --> 04:07.440]  our plant. I talked about beer cups. I like to start small plants in small
[04:07.640 --> 04:12.200]  pots. Either a beer cup, maybe a four, maybe a six inch net pot. The reason for
[04:12.200 --> 04:16.040]  that, why do you want to put a little tiny plant with a little tiny root zone
[04:16.040 --> 04:20.120]  in a big pot? Let's say you put it in a three gallon pot. You've got all that
[04:20.120 --> 04:24.160]  extra space in there for those roots to just swim around in. That's extra space
[04:24.160 --> 04:27.600]  that you need to water. That's going to require more water which will require
[04:27.600 --> 04:31.620]  more nutrients. Also you're going to have to spread the plants out more if they're
[04:31.620 --> 04:35.720]  in larger pots which means you may require more light. By keeping them in
[04:35.720 --> 04:39.040]  smaller pots it keeps the garden more efficient. It keeps things more
[04:39.040 --> 04:43.240]  cost-effective and it's easier to maintain. So I start my babies off in a
[04:43.240 --> 04:47.240]  little tiny pot and when it's time I transplant them into a one or three
[04:47.240 --> 04:51.920]  gallon pot. Sometimes I'll finish my plants in that one or three gallon pot.
[04:51.920 --> 04:56.220]  Other times I will either skip the three gallon and go straight into a seven
[04:56.220 --> 05:01.320]  gallon pot or I'll go from the cup into a three gallon into a seven gallon pot.
[05:01.920 --> 05:06.680]  Now let's talk about deciding which size pot to use. How do I know which size pot
[05:06.680 --> 05:11.680]  to transplant into? That all depends on how long that plant is going to live. It
[05:11.680 --> 05:15.840]  all depends on how big that plant is going to be in the end of its life cycle.
[05:15.840 --> 05:20.560]  How long are you going to veg? How long are you going to flower? The pot size
[05:20.560 --> 05:25.080]  will also play a huge factor into how frequently you need to water your garden.
[05:25.080 --> 05:28.720]  If you're running little one gallon pots and you've got semi large plants you're
[05:28.720 --> 05:32.200]  going to have to water every day. If you've got semi large plants but you're
[05:32.200 --> 05:36.240]  running seven or ten gallon pots you can go in dump a bunch of water in there. You
[05:36.240 --> 05:40.200]  can leave those for two, three, sometimes four or five days depending on how far
[05:40.200 --> 05:44.240]  into your cycles you are. So the pot size is going to make a huge difference on
[05:44.240 --> 05:48.360]  how frequently you water. Now let's talk about the size of the plant and the size
[05:48.360 --> 05:52.600]  of our container. When growing vigorous cannabis plants I would suggest
[05:52.600 --> 05:59.000]  approximately a two to three gallon pot for every 12 inches of plant growth. So
[05:59.000 --> 06:03.520]  if you've got a 12 inch tall plant you want about a two or three gallon pot and
[06:03.520 --> 06:06.680]  I'm talking about your finished plant size. So if your plant's gonna finish
[06:06.680 --> 06:10.840]  about 12 maybe 18 inches tall that's when you want a two or three gallon pot.
[06:10.840 --> 06:14.600]  Sometimes I'll get them about 24 inches tall in that three gallon pot but that's
[06:14.600 --> 06:18.640]  really pushing it then I'm watering every single day and they're thirsty at
[06:18.760 --> 06:24.280]  the start of every day. So if your plants are gonna finish around 12, 18, maybe 24
[06:24.280 --> 06:28.440]  inches at the maximum height then you can go in a two to three gallon pot. If
[06:28.440 --> 06:32.640]  you want to grow bigger plants you need bigger pots. If you want to go to like a
[06:32.640 --> 06:37.180]  two foot tall plant that's when I would definitely recommend three to five gallon
[06:37.180 --> 06:41.480]  pots. I like a five gallon pot. A five gallon pot is very versatile. Now if we
[06:41.480 --> 06:45.680]  want bigger plants we obviously need to move into bigger pots. If you want about
[06:45.680 --> 06:50.200]  a 36 inch to a 42 inch plant maybe just a little bit bigger that's when you need
[06:50.200 --> 06:53.920]  to work with the five to seven gallon pots. Now once you start going past five
[06:53.920 --> 06:57.360]  feet in an indoor grow it starts kind of becoming a pain in the ass unless you're
[06:57.360 --> 07:00.560]  in a commercial grow with gavitas up on the ceiling and you've got all that
[07:00.560 --> 07:04.440]  ceiling height. But a five or six foot tall plant is really as tall as I would
[07:04.440 --> 07:07.720]  recommend in an indoor grow unless you're really pushing it. If you're gonna
[07:07.720 --> 07:11.280]  push out a big six foot monster in the garage or something that's when you want
[07:11.280 --> 07:15.840]  to push into a 10 maybe a 12 gallon pot we just need to be sure to have enough
[07:15.840 --> 07:20.360]  root space to support these giant plants we're trying to grow. So try to select
[07:20.360 --> 07:23.680]  the appropriate container for the appropriate plant size you're going to
[07:23.680 --> 07:28.000]  work with. Also keep in mind that you can start small and you can always up pot
[07:28.000 --> 07:32.520]  that plant. I don't recommend up potting during flower if it's critical you can
[07:32.520 --> 07:36.880]  do that. I would like to see you transplant probably 10 days maybe 7-10
[07:36.880 --> 07:41.240]  days maybe 5 days before you put it into flower but you can if you're good at it
[07:41.240 --> 07:44.320]  and you're not going to shock the plant at all you can transplant it the day you
[07:44.320 --> 07:47.480]  flip into flower and you can put it into flower that day as long as you don't
[07:47.480 --> 07:50.920]  disrupt anything as long as you don't piss that plant off you will be okay. If
[07:50.920 --> 07:54.800]  you've given it any shock if you're not experienced with transplanting I would
[07:54.800 --> 07:58.480]  certainly give it a few days to recover that way it's not getting transplanted
[07:58.480 --> 08:01.400]  and triggered into flower and trying to figure life out all at the same time.
[08:01.400 --> 08:06.240]  Give that plant a chance. So we've talked about drainage we have talked about the
[08:06.240 --> 08:10.480]  height and size of a plant in a pot now let's talk about the pros and the cons
[08:10.640 --> 08:16.720]  of small pots versus large pots. Small pots let's talk about the advantage of
[08:16.720 --> 08:21.280]  using small containers in our garden with a smaller container you don't need
[08:21.280 --> 08:26.080]  as much water which means you don't need as much nutrient. The downside to that is
[08:26.080 --> 08:30.440]  you may need to water more frequently once the plants get a little larger you
[08:30.440 --> 08:34.520]  may be in there watering twice a day if your pots are too small for your plant
[08:34.520 --> 08:39.760]  size. Another advantage of small pots is that you can fit the plants closer
[08:39.880 --> 08:44.320]  together they don't take up as much space. The downfall to that is you don't
[08:44.320 --> 08:47.920]  have as much space for branching if you're running a strain that just does
[08:47.920 --> 08:52.000]  one stick straight up and doesn't have a lot of side branching maybe smaller pots
[08:52.000 --> 08:55.920]  are ideal because you can get them closer together. Another advantage to
[08:55.920 --> 09:00.840]  smaller pots are mobility. Some people aren't able-bodied some people need some
[09:00.840 --> 09:05.280]  assistance and large pots may not be ideal for them. These small pots may be
[09:05.480 --> 09:09.720]  the way to go for people who aren't physically able to manage a five or
[09:09.720 --> 09:14.120]  seven gallon pot. Once these plants once these pots are filled with medium if
[09:14.120 --> 09:17.200]  we're gonna put cocoa if we're gonna put soil we're gonna put a soilless mix
[09:17.200 --> 09:21.360]  whatever we put in there then you add a plant in there then you add a gallon of
[09:21.360 --> 09:24.200]  water to a five gallon pot that's got quite a bit of weight to it if you're
[09:24.200 --> 09:28.120]  not an able-bodied person or if you've got anything slowing you down that pot
[09:28.120 --> 09:33.160]  may not move it may be stuck right there. So one of the advantages of smaller pots
[09:33.320 --> 09:38.120]  is mobility. Now let's talk about larger pots as we work our way into larger pots
[09:38.120 --> 09:43.200]  we do have different advantages and disadvantages. One advantage of larger
[09:43.200 --> 09:48.840]  pots is less frequent watering. The disadvantage to that is it takes more to
[09:48.840 --> 09:53.160]  water at one time. Let's say we've got a seven gallon pot and the plants in about
[09:53.160 --> 09:57.000]  week three of flower and we've given that plant a chance to dry out a little
[09:57.000 --> 10:01.120]  bit and it's actually thirsty and it's prime time for water that plant may take
[10:01.120 --> 10:06.160]  at least a gallon maybe a gallon and a half possibly two full gallons of water.
[10:06.160 --> 10:11.240]  So it's gonna take a lot more water to water that larger pot but we're not
[10:11.240 --> 10:16.640]  going to need to water it for probably three days. Now my favorite advantage to
[10:16.640 --> 10:21.300]  running large seven gallon pots is bigger plants. In a bigger pot you can
[10:21.300 --> 10:25.440]  get a bigger plant. There are a lot of things to consider when thinking about
[10:25.440 --> 10:30.120]  pot size. The main thing to think about is how big will your plant be in the end?
[10:30.120 --> 10:34.520]  You need a big enough home for your plant at its finished size. Now something
[10:34.520 --> 10:39.520]  to help you kind of think about pot size is plant count. In Colorado we are
[10:39.520 --> 10:44.120]  strictly limited by the amount of plants we grow. It doesn't matter how big those
[10:44.120 --> 10:49.080]  plants are but the number is what they go by. So somewhere like Colorado with a
[10:49.080 --> 10:53.640]  limited plant count that's where we start growing gigantic plants. Instead of
[10:53.640 --> 10:57.400]  having a whole bunch of little plants under one light we just put one plant
[10:57.400 --> 11:01.160]  under a light and veg it for a long time and then flower that out and we try
[11:01.160 --> 11:05.520]  to get one to two pounds out of one plant under one light. So plant count is
[11:05.520 --> 11:10.000]  a huge factor to keep in mind when thinking about pot size. Now if you don't
[11:10.000 --> 11:15.200]  have a plant count your options are limitless. You can run little four inch
[11:15.200 --> 11:19.560]  by four inch rockwool cubes. You can put 64 of those on a four by four tray and
[11:19.560 --> 11:24.360]  you can absolutely pull easily a pound underneath one light with 64 little
[11:24.360 --> 11:28.520]  plants and very little veg time. Or if you want bigger plants you can do nine
[11:28.520 --> 11:32.640]  three gallon pots under a thousand watt light. Or if you want to go bigger that's
[11:32.640 --> 11:35.880]  when I would start recommending like four seven gallon pots under a thousand
[11:35.880 --> 11:40.360]  or if you want to go even bigger maybe do one or two ten gallons or maybe just
[11:40.360 --> 11:45.480]  one 12 gallon pot underneath a thousand watt light. Those are some of the pros
[11:45.480 --> 11:49.560]  and cons or the advantages and disadvantages of larger and smaller pots.
[11:49.560 --> 11:53.400]  I talked about different types of pots let's go over some of the types of pots
[11:53.440 --> 11:58.320]  that are available. I talked about net pots. Net pots are usually available in
[11:58.320 --> 12:01.880]  four or six inch diameters. They aren't very deep they're only about three or
[12:01.880 --> 12:06.200]  four inches deep. They look like somebody took a pot and then just cut a bunch of
[12:06.200 --> 12:10.560]  holes out of it to make it more like a mesh more like a spaghetti strainer. That
[12:10.560 --> 12:15.200]  is a net pot. The advantage to that is that it gets a lot of airflow so you
[12:15.200 --> 12:19.480]  don't ever over water the plants and you get plenty of wet and dry cycling and
[12:19.520 --> 12:24.120]  you get a lot of oxygen to your root zone. The downfall with the net pots is
[12:24.120 --> 12:27.920]  being so small and allowing all that airflow they do require frequent
[12:27.920 --> 12:32.360]  watering once the plants start building a good root system in there. The next
[12:32.360 --> 12:36.280]  pots I talked about were our basic nursery pots. They're the plastic pots we
[12:36.280 --> 12:40.120]  are all familiar with. They come in a lot of different sizes. They're usually round
[12:40.120 --> 12:44.120]  some of them are square. They are available in black or white. If you're
[12:44.120 --> 12:48.040]  growing outdoors I may recommend a white pot if it's available in the size you're
[12:48.040 --> 12:52.640]  looking for. Indoors I don't think it makes a difference. Those pots are great.
[12:52.640 --> 12:56.380]  There's a reason why they are the industry standard. They come in any size
[12:56.380 --> 13:01.060]  and volume you need and they are also very affordable. So those are your basic
[13:01.060 --> 13:05.840]  nursery pots. The advantage to those is they don't dry out as quickly as a root
[13:05.840 --> 13:10.380]  pot or an air pot so you'll have more time between waterings. The disadvantage
[13:10.380 --> 13:15.520]  is less root growth and slower root growth because that restricted airflow.
[13:16.080 --> 13:19.880]  More airflow allows more root growth. It also allows the plants to dry more
[13:19.880 --> 13:23.600]  quickly so there's a balance there between plastic pots and fabric pots.
[13:23.600 --> 13:29.000]  That's a great way to segue into fabric pots. Fabric pots are available in many
[13:29.000 --> 13:33.240]  sizes. I've seen them as small as a half gallon and I've seen them as big as 200
[13:33.240 --> 13:38.320]  gallons and everything in between. Let's talk about the advantages of the fabric
[13:38.320 --> 13:43.400]  pots. There is a lot of airflow to your root zone. I talked about it earlier. The
[13:43.560 --> 13:49.400]  roots love airflow. This also helps us prevent over watering. Even if you do
[13:49.400 --> 13:53.080]  over water that pots not going to hold it because it is fabric. That water will
[13:53.080 --> 13:56.800]  just run right off so that's really advantageous with the large pot.
[13:56.800 --> 14:01.460]  Something I should mention. Here's the disadvantage. Your air pots, your fabric
[14:01.460 --> 14:05.680]  pots are going to dry out much more quickly than a plastic pot because of
[14:05.680 --> 14:10.120]  all that airflow. I would suggest buying a little larger pot if you're going to
[14:10.120 --> 14:15.400]  run fabric pots. If you want to run five gallon plastic pots consider seven gallon
[14:15.400 --> 14:19.840]  fabric pots for that extra time so that you don't have to water and your roots
[14:19.840 --> 14:23.160]  are just going to grow more quickly with those air pots so I would recommend that
[14:23.160 --> 14:28.080]  extra space just to be safe. The advantage to fabric pots is faster
[14:28.080 --> 14:31.560]  growing more productive roots. The disadvantage is you're going to have to
[14:31.560 --> 14:35.880]  water more frequently. Now let's talk about those air pots or the waffle pots
[14:35.880 --> 14:40.000]  I talked about. What are those things all about? Those are great for the same
[14:40.040 --> 14:44.200]  reason as the fabric pots because your roots get oxygen from all directions.
[14:44.200 --> 14:49.520]  Another great thing about them is they have got rivets on them. When it's time
[14:49.520 --> 14:53.800]  to up pot your pot you don't have to lift that root ball up out of that pot.
[14:53.800 --> 14:58.720]  You can undo the rivets and that pot unwraps off of your root ball then you
[14:58.720 --> 15:02.960]  can gently pick that root ball up and set it into your up pot container. And
[15:02.960 --> 15:07.080]  once your plant is up potted all you have to do is pop the rivets back in and
[15:07.200 --> 15:11.120]  you can reuse that pot. So it is reusable you didn't have to destroy it to get the
[15:11.120 --> 15:14.020]  plant out of there and the plant didn't have to get destroyed to get out of
[15:14.020 --> 15:19.320]  there. So that's the advantage to those. The disadvantage is the same as the
[15:19.320 --> 15:25.040]  fabric pots they require more frequent watering. So that's a basic breakdown of
[15:25.040 --> 15:28.360]  the three most common types of pots you're going to run into when shopping
[15:28.360 --> 15:33.280]  for pots for your new grow. No matter what type of pot you select you're going
[15:33.280 --> 15:37.440]  to need something under that to collect the runoff water. Keep in mind you'll
[15:37.440 --> 15:41.320]  need some sort of saucer or a tray underneath your pot or maybe you're
[15:41.320 --> 15:45.120]  gonna put all of your pots on a table. Just think about when you water that's
[15:45.120 --> 15:48.640]  all gonna run off you need to collect that water somehow. It's got to go
[15:48.640 --> 15:51.960]  somewhere even if you're running it all off into a table it's all got to get to
[15:51.960 --> 15:55.400]  a drain somehow. If you're just running it into saucers you may need to get a
[15:55.400 --> 15:59.040]  shop vac and suck that water out of there. Don't leave those plants sitting
[15:59.200 --> 16:04.280]  in stagnant water for too long. Alright that basically covers the pots and the
[16:04.280 --> 16:08.760]  part that goes on the floor. I've been talking for about 16 minutes my throat's
[16:08.760 --> 16:12.280]  getting a little dry my head's getting a little clear I'm gonna press pause I'm
[16:12.280 --> 16:16.240]  gonna take a couple of dabs I'm gonna get a drink and then when we get back we
[16:16.240 --> 16:21.280]  will talk about selecting our medium for our new grow. While I'm taking a couple
[16:21.280 --> 16:25.680]  of dabs I'm going to drop in a quick promotion for my patreon campaign. This
[16:25.680 --> 16:30.160]  podcast is free. I do this podcast because I love cannabis and because I
[16:30.160 --> 16:34.440]  love helping people. I want to see you grow the best cannabis you can grow so
[16:34.440 --> 16:38.760]  you can provide that for yourself and people that rely on you. There are a few
[16:38.760 --> 16:43.000]  costs involved in producing and hosting a podcast. If you would like to help
[16:43.000 --> 16:47.460]  offset those costs and further my efforts in producing a quality show you
[16:47.460 --> 16:52.560]  can do so by contributing to my patreon campaign. For more information visit

[17:04.680 --> 17:09.000]  help I would truly appreciate your support. Now let's get right back to the
[17:09.000 --> 17:14.160]  show. Alright podcast world I am back got all my problems solved and I'm ready to
[17:14.160 --> 17:18.640]  continue with this show. Let's talk about the medium we're going to select for our
[17:18.640 --> 17:22.960]  new grow. Medium that is what's going to go inside of our pot that is what our
[17:22.960 --> 17:27.880]  plant is going to grow out of. Are you going to choose soil? A soilless mix? Are
[17:27.880 --> 17:31.840]  you going to grow in cocoa? Are you gonna cook up a batch of super soil? Maybe you
[17:31.840 --> 17:36.120]  want some living soil? Maybe you want to do a TLO or a no-till sort of system? Or
[17:36.120 --> 17:40.720]  maybe you're just going to grow in rock wool cubes? And I know I don't have a lot
[17:40.720 --> 17:44.480]  of information in this episode for our hydro friends but I will put together an
[17:45.080 --> 17:50.800]  entire hydro segment in the future for our waterborne friends. But for now let's
[17:50.800 --> 17:55.360]  talk about soil and soilless mixes. A lot of people will tell you that they are
[17:55.360 --> 18:00.200]  growing in soil when actually they are growing in a soilless mix. Let's talk
[18:00.200 --> 18:05.960]  about the main differences between soil and a soilless mix. A soilless mix is
[18:05.960 --> 18:12.560]  right between a soil and a hydro grow. Soilless mix looks just like soil or dirt.
[18:13.040 --> 18:19.120]  The difference is there are no nutrients in a soilless mix. Soilless mixes are
[18:19.120 --> 18:24.520]  basically peat or cocoa based. Most of your soilless mixes will have plenty of
[18:24.520 --> 18:30.040]  aeration added to them like perlite or volcanic rock. Soilless mixes are great
[18:30.040 --> 18:34.040]  because they give us complete control over what we are feeding our plants. Now
[18:34.040 --> 18:38.240]  that leads us right into soil. The main difference between a soilless blend and
[18:38.400 --> 18:44.080]  soil is the soil will have nutrients. Most of our store bought soil mixes will
[18:44.080 --> 18:47.880]  have the same things as a soilless mix. It will have the perlite, it will have
[18:47.880 --> 18:52.520]  the peat moss in there, but it will also contain organically decomposed matter
[18:52.520 --> 18:57.880]  that make the soil rich in micro and macro nutrients. Now the advantage to
[18:57.880 --> 19:01.720]  that is that you don't need to feed your plants as heavily if at all. The
[19:01.720 --> 19:06.040]  disadvantage is you don't need to feed your plants so you don't have control
[19:06.160 --> 19:09.560]  over what you're feeding your plants. There are already nutrients in that
[19:09.560 --> 19:14.400]  medium and you may not know exactly what's there. Also eventually those
[19:14.400 --> 19:18.160]  nutrients will be eaten up and you will need to either reamend that soil or
[19:18.160 --> 19:22.720]  start using bottled nutrients. So that's the main difference between soil and a
[19:22.720 --> 19:28.360]  soilless mix. Most of us are going to go with a soilless mix. Most of the soil and
[19:28.360 --> 19:32.440]  soilless mixes available at your local growth shop will be suitable for you to
[19:32.440 --> 19:36.520]  grow in. I really try not to recommend specific products and specific brands
[19:36.520 --> 19:40.840]  but I want to make this easy for everybody. Fox Farms Ocean Forest soil is
[19:40.840 --> 19:44.400]  available everywhere and it will work for you. Some people are gonna hate me
[19:44.400 --> 19:48.320]  for that, some people are gonna love me for that. It works, it is fine. If that's
[19:48.320 --> 19:53.480]  what's available to you, get that. It will do a good job. Also Roots Organics makes
[19:53.480 --> 19:57.480]  a quality soil. Again I'm gonna get lovers and haters for that. I'm trying to
[19:57.480 --> 20:02.160]  make this easy for new growers. If you want a big bale of soil it's going to
[20:02.160 --> 20:06.720]  work very well for you. Sunshine Mix number four is very cost-effective and
[20:06.720 --> 20:11.600]  it is a quality product for a new grower. I really try to stay away from specific
[20:11.600 --> 20:15.440]  products but those will work for a new grower and I know they are available at
[20:15.440 --> 20:21.600]  most reputable grow shops. If you choose to grow in a soil, eventually you may
[20:21.600 --> 20:27.440]  need to reamend that soil or start watering with bottled nutrients. If you
[20:27.440 --> 20:32.080]  go with the soilless mix you do need to start feeding nutrients right away.
[20:32.400 --> 20:36.800]  That's when we'll need to start thinking about organics or synthetics or boxes or
[20:36.800 --> 20:43.440]  bottles. Now that gives us a beautiful segue into pre-made soil mixes. A lot of
[20:43.440 --> 20:46.280]  people don't want to use bottled nutrients. They want to be more
[20:46.280 --> 20:50.560]  sustainable and they want to be more organic. The best options to do that are
[20:50.560 --> 20:56.520]  things like Super Soil or other living soils or TLO or a no-till setup. When
[20:56.520 --> 21:00.120]  you're using these pre-made soils you don't need to add bottled nutrients
[21:00.120 --> 21:03.800]  because everything is already in the medium available to the plant as the
[21:03.800 --> 21:07.920]  plant needs it. Now let's talk briefly about what I mean by Super Soil or a
[21:07.920 --> 21:11.360]  living soil. They're very similar. Some people are going to argue with me but
[21:11.360 --> 21:14.200]  we're going to put them in the same category for the sake of this talk. A
[21:14.200 --> 21:19.720]  Super Soil or a living soil is exactly that. It is a soil that is alive. It is
[21:19.720 --> 21:23.880]  filled with microbes and beneficial fungus and bacteria and all of the macro
[21:23.880 --> 21:27.320]  and micronutrients we need to get our plant through the growth cycle. A
[21:27.320 --> 21:31.600]  lot of times people add a few bonus items in there like some volcanic rock
[21:31.600 --> 21:37.040]  dust or whatever your secret ingredient may be. But a Super Soil you basically
[21:37.040 --> 21:40.240]  gather all of your ingredients and the way I would do it I would throw a large
[21:40.240 --> 21:44.560]  tarp on the ground in the garage. I would mix up all of the ingredients together.
[21:44.560 --> 21:49.040]  There's going to be bags of a base mix which will probably be a soilless mix
[21:49.040 --> 21:52.480]  that you'll probably get from a grow store and then a lot of amendments.
[21:52.480 --> 21:56.360]  Depending on your style of growing and what you want to do the amendments will
[21:56.520 --> 22:00.120]  vary. If you've heard Shawn and Jesse on the show before you know we're probably
[22:00.120 --> 22:04.280]  going to put some alfalfa in there. We'll probably put some caranja in there.
[22:04.280 --> 22:08.440]  Probably be some neem cakes in there. It all just depends on the style of your
[22:08.440 --> 22:12.840]  grow. If you want to use animal products you can put blood meal, bone meal, and
[22:12.840 --> 22:16.680]  fish meal in there. You can always put oyster shell stuff in there. You can put
[22:16.680 --> 22:20.840]  kelp meal in there. All that type of stuff will go into a living soil or a
[22:20.840 --> 22:25.280]  Super Soil. Then it will get mixed up and put into a container. Then a little water
[22:25.280 --> 22:28.360]  will be added. That will make everything come to life in there. You'll start
[22:28.360 --> 22:32.440]  seeing a little white fungus on top of your soil. That is a good thing. That is
[22:32.440 --> 22:37.540]  why we call it living soil. That's a living soil or a Super Soil idea. You can
[22:37.540 --> 22:42.320]  find plenty of recipes online. If you google Subcool's Super Soil recipe you
[22:42.320 --> 22:46.820]  will find it I promise. You can also go to Build A Soil's website and I'm sure
[22:46.820 --> 22:51.240]  they will give you plenty of information on building a living soil. Now let me
[22:51.240 --> 22:57.520]  talk briefly about the pros and cons of a living soil or a Super Soil. First it's
[22:57.520 --> 23:02.240]  a lot of ingredients to gather but they are affordable. They're probably more
[23:02.240 --> 23:06.080]  cost-effective than buying a bunch of bottles. So you gather your ingredients
[23:06.080 --> 23:09.920]  then you've got to mix them yourself which is kind of fun if you're into that.
[23:09.920 --> 23:13.720]  If you're not into that it's a giant pain in the ass. I think it's fun. You
[23:13.720 --> 23:17.560]  lay out a giant tarp in the garage. You weigh out and measure out your stuff. You
[23:17.560 --> 23:21.220]  mix it up. You put it in containers. It's a good time. So there's work to it. Then
[23:21.220 --> 23:26.220]  it's got to cook. It needs a specified time. Depending on your ingredients it
[23:26.220 --> 23:32.460]  needs about 30 maybe 45 days. So it needs prep time. That is the downfall. Another
[23:32.460 --> 23:36.660]  downfall is a lot of those organic amendments are not completely reliable
[23:36.660 --> 23:40.860]  on their nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus levels. We're adding a bunch
[23:40.860 --> 23:44.580]  of things to a bunch of other things and cooking it. It may come out a little
[23:44.580 --> 23:48.620]  richer or a little lighter than we expected. If you're not an experienced
[23:48.620 --> 23:52.980]  grower a super soil may throw your plants off and you will have no idea how
[23:52.980 --> 23:57.180]  to adjust and correct that. So that is one of the major downfalls to a living
[23:57.180 --> 24:01.020]  soil for a new grower. If you mix everything properly and you know how to
[24:01.020 --> 24:05.120]  pay attention to the plants a living soil and a super soil can do beautiful
[24:05.120 --> 24:09.980]  things for your garden. Now if you really want to step your game up you can go TLO
[24:09.980 --> 24:14.020]  which means true living organics or you can go no-till. They're both very similar.
[24:14.020 --> 24:18.180]  I honestly don't have a lot of experience in either one. That's Sean and
[24:18.180 --> 24:21.740]  Jesse's department. They both crush it with the TLO and with the living organic
[24:21.740 --> 24:25.140]  stuff but that's when you start involving worms into your grow. That's
[24:25.140 --> 24:29.780]  when... so with the no-till garden we're never taking anything to the trash. We're
[24:29.780 --> 24:33.940]  basically harvesting a plant and then where the hole from that plant was we
[24:33.940 --> 24:37.060]  put another plant and then backfill it with a little bit of compost that we've
[24:37.060 --> 24:42.220]  made ourselves. The waste from the plant after we harvest it goes back into our
[24:42.220 --> 24:47.360]  compost so we reuse almost everything in a no-till environment. Again with the TLO
[24:47.440 --> 24:51.360]  and a no-till environment it does take some time to prepare and set up that
[24:51.360 --> 24:56.400]  soil. One good thing about a no-till all of my no-till friends tell me it gets
[24:56.400 --> 25:00.640]  better with every grow. They bought everything for the no-till grow. They set
[25:00.640 --> 25:04.600]  it up one time and they got it going and they got it dialed in and they grew a
[25:04.600 --> 25:08.640]  crop and those plants came out pretty well. They pulled out that root ball. They
[25:08.640 --> 25:11.600]  put that in the compost bin. They put a fresh plant in there. They added some
[25:11.600 --> 25:15.080]  compost. They reamended. They put some cover crop on the plant or on the pot
[25:15.080 --> 25:18.400]  and then it grew in there. The whole plant grew again. They said that second
[25:18.400 --> 25:22.120]  crop was better. The last time Frosty was here I think he said he was on his
[25:22.120 --> 25:26.440]  seventh run with his no-till crop and it is getting better every time. Imagine if
[25:26.440 --> 25:31.600]  every time you grew in the dirt it got better. A normal soil or a soilless mix
[25:31.600 --> 25:35.760]  guy is either throwing that away or trying to find some way to recycle it
[25:35.760 --> 25:40.240]  and it's a struggle. So the advantage there of the no-till is you are
[25:40.240 --> 25:44.480]  recycling all of your grow to go back into your grow. It is very sustainable
[25:44.480 --> 25:50.440]  and it is 100% organic if you keep it that way. The downfall is it takes a lot
[25:50.440 --> 25:54.760]  of time to set up and it's a hundred percent organic. So if you have a problem
[25:54.760 --> 25:59.320]  you have to research a hundred percent organic methods to correct your issues.
[25:59.320 --> 26:03.720]  You can't go to the store, buy a bottle of something, shake it up, apply it to
[26:03.720 --> 26:07.880]  your plants and think you've solved your problem. It's not so easy in a no-till
[26:07.920 --> 26:11.800]  environment. It looks like it takes a little more thinking but it also looks
[26:11.800 --> 26:14.960]  like it is much more rewarding. My friends that grow the no-till weed it
[26:14.960 --> 26:21.160]  really tastes really good. So the pros of the no-till and the TLO grow is it's
[26:21.160 --> 26:24.280]  organic. You know what you're putting in there. You know that you're gonna have a
[26:24.280 --> 26:28.880]  clean tasty product. Also it's being self-sustained. You don't have to
[26:28.880 --> 26:31.960]  introduce a bunch of funky shit. You don't have to keep buying products. There
[26:31.960 --> 26:36.320]  are no bottles to throw away. The downside is it takes a little while to
[26:36.400 --> 26:40.240]  get your medium started before you can even put a plant in there. You guys I
[26:40.240 --> 26:45.440]  honestly don't have enough experience with a super soil, a living soil, a TLO or
[26:45.440 --> 26:49.400]  a no-till grow to talk like I'm an expert. I'm trying to give you the best
[26:49.400 --> 26:52.680]  of my knowledge from what I understand. I'm sure there is more to think about
[26:52.680 --> 26:56.880]  when it comes to those types of grows. Those are more advanced techniques in my
[26:56.880 --> 27:01.080]  opinion. Now we've talked about soil and soilless mixes. We've talked about living
[27:01.240 --> 27:06.320]  soils. Let's talk about the exact opposite. Let's talk about cocoa. I really
[27:06.320 --> 27:11.320]  like growing in cocoa. I have a lot of experience growing in cocoa. If I were to
[27:11.320 --> 27:14.800]  set up a commercial grow today and I had a budget that I could do whatever I
[27:14.800 --> 27:19.680]  wanted with, we would run a cocoa setup. It would be cocoa with a lot of perlite.
[27:19.680 --> 27:25.800]  I like cocoa because cocoa doesn't hold on to any nutrients. I also like cocoa
[27:25.800 --> 27:30.560]  because it is inert. It does not contain any nutrients when you buy it. It is just
[27:30.720 --> 27:35.080]  clean medium that the plants can hang out in. The roots really seem to be
[27:35.080 --> 27:38.840]  comfortable in there. You get to control everything when it comes to cocoa. You
[27:38.840 --> 27:43.120]  get to control every nutrient that goes in there. I really like the wet and dry
[27:43.120 --> 27:48.520]  time with cocoa. A well aerated cocoa wet and dry time is beautiful. One thing
[27:48.520 --> 27:53.360]  about cocoa, it kind of works like hydro. I'm able to feed my cocoa grow twice a
[27:53.360 --> 27:57.280]  day. I can pump nutrients through that grow two times every day, which means
[27:57.280 --> 28:01.880]  those plants are really eating heavily. A couple of tips if you choose cocoa,
[28:01.880 --> 28:06.440]  make sure you rinse your cocoa before you put your plants in it. Wash it off.
[28:06.440 --> 28:10.040]  It is dirty. I'm not sure where you got your cocoa from. Who knows where they
[28:10.040 --> 28:13.640]  got it from? Who knows where it was stored? Just rinse it. If you can just
[28:13.640 --> 28:16.680]  fill a pot with it, if that's what you need to do, put it in a giant pot and
[28:16.680 --> 28:19.160]  then just run a bunch of water through it to where you're running the water
[28:19.160 --> 28:23.960]  clean. That would really be beneficial for you. Also, when you're running cocoa,
[28:24.280 --> 28:29.320]  you may need more cow mag than you're used to. Earlier I said nothing stays in
[28:29.320 --> 28:32.360]  the cocoa. That means that the cow mag just falls right out. When you've got
[28:32.360 --> 28:36.080]  runoff water, that cow mag went right on out with that. It's not hanging out in
[28:36.080 --> 28:39.920]  the medium like it would if you had soil. There's nothing for it to hang on to in
[28:39.920 --> 28:44.200]  the cocoa. The cocoa doesn't grab it like a soil or soilless mix would. A
[28:44.200 --> 28:47.800]  couple of basic tips if you choose to go in cocoa would be make sure you rinse it.
[28:47.800 --> 28:51.560]  It may be salty. You don't want to put your plants in that salty environment.
[28:51.680 --> 28:56.920]  Then increase your cow mag and possibly you may need to increase your overall
[28:56.920 --> 29:01.200]  nutrient regimen. I recommend feeding every day when you're growing in cocoa.
[29:01.200 --> 29:05.320]  If you're in soil or a soilless mix, you may be only feeding once a week or twice
[29:05.320 --> 29:10.760]  a week. You can feed every single day in cocoa. Every time you water those plants,
[29:10.760 --> 29:14.960]  put some nutrients in there if you're growing in cocoa. A lot of times in the
[29:14.960 --> 29:18.640]  big grow, we would give them a big watering, a big feeding to start the day.
[29:18.720 --> 29:21.760]  They would get base nutrients. They would get cow mag. They would get a bloom
[29:21.760 --> 29:24.920]  booster. They would get their whatever else we were feeding them that day. We
[29:24.920 --> 29:28.200]  had a whole list of stuff. We'd feed the plants. We'd feed them that early in the
[29:28.200 --> 29:32.040]  morning. Then right before we leave a lot of times, we would just shoot just a
[29:32.040 --> 29:36.360]  small feed of just base nutrients and cow mag through at the end of the day just
[29:36.360 --> 29:39.400]  to make sure the plants were wet by the time we got there in the morning. They
[29:39.400 --> 29:43.120]  really liked being fed twice a day. That first time we would feed them a big fat
[29:43.120 --> 29:46.480]  meal. The second time, just base nudes and cow mag.
[29:46.920 --> 29:51.640]  The benefit to growing in cocoa is you get to control all of the nutrients. In
[29:51.640 --> 29:55.200]  the middle, I don't know if it's a pro or con, it dries up more quickly than
[29:55.200 --> 29:59.040]  soil. You may need to water more often. I like that because that means I get to
[29:59.040 --> 30:00.760]  feed more frequently.
[30:01.080 --> 30:05.640]  Now the con to growing in cocoa, it's not as forgiving as soil or a soilless
[30:05.640 --> 30:10.240]  mix. It's acting more like hydro. If you make a mistake, you're going to see it
[30:10.480 --> 30:15.520]  immediately. There's no buffer to fix your mistakes. If you overfeed in cocoa,
[30:15.520 --> 30:17.280]  those plants will show you right away.
[30:17.720 --> 30:22.280]  Now let's move into the last medium that I have on my list to talk about, and
[30:22.280 --> 30:26.840]  that is rockwool. Rockwool are those cubes that you see at the growth store.
[30:27.080 --> 30:31.080]  They just look like a giant sponge. They're great for hydro. They are great
[30:31.080 --> 30:35.560]  for a commercial environment. They are very cost effective. They are very easy
[30:35.560 --> 30:42.000]  to dispose of. They work very much like cocoa. They do not have any nutrients in
[30:42.040 --> 30:47.840]  them. They do not hold any nutrients. They also have a very nice wet and dry
[30:47.840 --> 30:53.080]  time. They come in a very large variety of sizes. You can get them in a one by
[30:53.080 --> 30:57.600]  one cube, so you can cut your clone into a little one by one. Then they also make
[30:57.600 --> 31:02.000]  them in a four by four, a six by six, just about any size you need. And you can
[31:02.000 --> 31:06.920]  grow a huge plant in a small rockwool cube. You can cut your clone into a one
[31:06.920 --> 31:10.400]  inch rockwool cube, and then the four by four has a little spot where that one
[31:10.400 --> 31:14.160]  inch will set right into it. And then the eight inch has a little slot cut into
[31:14.160 --> 31:17.600]  it where that four by four fits right into it. So you can just keep up potting
[31:17.600 --> 31:22.040]  just by setting it on top of another one. That really saves a lot of work in a
[31:22.040 --> 31:26.360]  large commercial grow. And I probably shouldn't forget that they also offer
[31:26.480 --> 31:30.920]  cocoa in the same types of slabs. You put your clone into a small little cocoa
[31:30.920 --> 31:34.200]  slab, and then it fits right into a larger, which fits into a larger cocoa
[31:34.200 --> 31:38.440]  slab. It kind of looks like a volcano. I should not forget about that. Those are
[31:38.440 --> 31:42.960]  great for hydro type applications. All right, you guys, I feel like that is
[31:42.960 --> 31:46.600]  enough podcasting for one episode. We talked about selecting containers. We
[31:46.600 --> 31:50.440]  talked about selecting your medium. In the next episode, we will talk about
[31:50.520 --> 31:55.360]  selecting nutrients for your new grow. Do you want to go organic? Do you want to
[31:55.360 --> 31:59.720]  go synthetic? We will talk about it in depth on the next episode. I want to
[31:59.720 --> 32:03.400]  thank you guys again for listening. Don't forget about the Patreon campaign.
[32:03.520 --> 32:08.400]  You can find that at patreon.com slash grow from your heart. I would appreciate
[32:08.400 --> 32:12.680]  your support there. I'll be back in just a few days with a fresh new episode. I
[32:12.680 --> 32:16.480]  want to give a huge shout out to my friend Della Luna glass and until next
[32:16.480 --> 32:19.320]  time take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me
