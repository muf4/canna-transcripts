[00:43.620 --> 00:48.500]  Calm, you know, I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking today
[00:48.500 --> 00:53.120]  I've been taking dabs of sex on the beach live batter from green dot labs
[00:53.280 --> 01:00.740]  This is a blend of paradise island and Han Solo burger. The flavor is described as strawberry pina colada
[01:00.840 --> 01:05.360]  You know, I think I agree with that. It's very tropical. It's very fruity. It's very delicious
[01:05.360 --> 01:08.500]  I think I tasted pineapple and coconut maybe in there
[01:08.680 --> 01:13.600]  Maybe that's the pina colada part very delicious made me feel like I was on a beach on an island
[01:13.600 --> 01:17.180]  I can almost feel the wind blow through my dreadlocks as I dabbed this one
[01:17.180 --> 01:23.620]  So big shout out to our friends at green dot labs for the super delicious sex on the beach live batter
[01:24.460 --> 01:27.740]  All right in this episode. I'm going to do a long rant about
[01:28.260 --> 01:32.340]  Feminized seeds I'll talk about how they're made. I'll talk about labeling
[01:32.340 --> 01:37.060]  But before we get there, let's do some shout outs to our friends who support the show on

[02:34.420 --> 02:40.700]  Alright, I did say I was going to do a rant about making and labeling feminized seeds
[02:41.660 --> 02:46.620]  Something I should say before I get into this is this is my method. This is how I do it
[02:46.620 --> 02:51.020]  I'm not saying that your method the way you were taught the way you learned the way you read the way
[02:51.180 --> 02:53.140]  Somebody else showed you how to do it is wrong
[02:53.140 --> 02:57.460]  I'm saying this is how I do it and I personally have seen great success
[02:57.460 --> 03:01.420]  I think the people who end up with my seeds see great success
[03:01.420 --> 03:06.780]  I think the people who vend my seeds are very satisfied with me and I do not get any complaints
[03:06.940 --> 03:12.700]  So with that disclaimer, let's talk about how I make feminized I regenerate exceeds
[03:13.900 --> 03:17.340]  The first thing I want to cover something that really frustrates me
[03:17.340 --> 03:22.860]  I see it on social media people have this assumption this idea in their head that
[03:23.220 --> 03:30.260]  Feminized seeds are hermaphrodites. They are not herms. They're not hermaphrodites. They're not Hermes
[03:30.260 --> 03:33.140]  I don't like the word Hermes. It sounds very immature
[03:33.740 --> 03:39.020]  It's a hermaphrodite or it's an intersex plant if you want to chop the word hermaphrodite down just say Herm
[03:39.140 --> 03:44.260]  Hermes sounds childish to me. Maybe that's just weird to me. That's not a big deal. Let's continue
[03:44.260 --> 03:48.740]  The plants are not hermaphrodites. They are not intersex. They are true and trusted
[03:49.420 --> 03:51.100]  female plants
[03:51.100 --> 03:59.100]  The females that I use have been stress tested and specially selected for breeding if I have a female plant
[04:00.020 --> 04:05.180]  Before I even consider breeding with it I beat the shit out of that plant and how do I do that?
[04:05.660 --> 04:10.660]  there are a lot of ways to trigger a plant to show a hermaphroditic trait or a
[04:11.180 --> 04:17.260]  Intersex trait if it's in that plant the easiest way to do it is to disrupt the light cycle during flower
[04:17.540 --> 04:21.820]  So when I am working with new plants if I intend to breed with them
[04:21.820 --> 04:28.700]  I will put that female plant into flower for about two weeks. Everything is normal. I'm on 1212. I'm feeding it normally
[04:28.700 --> 04:33.740]  We're going into flower. Things are starting to look good as soon as the plant is comfortable in 1212
[04:33.740 --> 04:39.380]  I'm gonna fuck it up and put it on 18-6. Now the plant goes. Wait a minute. It was the fall now
[04:39.380 --> 04:42.420]  It's spring again. I'm still alive. I don't know what to do
[04:42.820 --> 04:49.140]  Some plants will freak the fuck out. Some plants will show signs of intersex traits of hermaphroditism
[04:49.820 --> 04:54.660]  Within a few days, they will pop up little male flowers. They'll pop up full-on pollen sacks
[04:54.660 --> 04:58.820]  They will show you problems you get rid of those plants or do not breed with them
[04:58.820 --> 05:03.340]  If you want to grow those in your own private garden, that is cool. You're not breeding. You're not passing on that trait
[05:03.340 --> 05:08.900]  Just know that that's an option one day when you fuck up if you get a light leak if something goes wrong that plant could
[05:09.260 --> 05:14.860]  Turn into a hermaphrodite and that plant could express that trait and that plant could pollinate your garden. I
[05:15.540 --> 05:19.380]  Get rid of those. I don't grow them. I don't breed them. They're not allowed in my grow
[05:19.380 --> 05:25.900]  I've got very high standards for my breeding for my cultivation if it shows any intersex traits it goes bye-bye
[05:25.900 --> 05:30.020]  I don't want it. We're not hanging out. It's not my friend. Nothing personal. I'm in it for business
[05:30.020 --> 05:38.220]  I can't have problematic plants. So the bottom line is these are solid tried-and-true tested females other ways that I abuse them
[05:38.220 --> 05:43.540]  So I said that I'll change that light cycle to 18-6 then I may still not see problems
[05:43.540 --> 05:46.760]  So I'll put it back on 12-12 after three to five days now
[05:46.760 --> 05:50.740]  We're three weeks in we either see some problems or we don't I'll put it back on 12-12
[05:51.040 --> 05:56.820]  Finish out weeks three and four on 12-12 then at week six or seven. Let's just fuck up that light cycle all again
[05:56.820 --> 05:59.900]  Let's put it on 24 hours a day and see if those plants herm out
[05:59.900 --> 06:02.560]  See if they have any signs of stress see if they freak out on me
[06:02.680 --> 06:07.240]  Those plants better not freak out and if they do guess what chop chop. Bye. Bye. See you later
[06:07.240 --> 06:09.240]  They don't get to play with my friends anymore. They're gone
[06:09.560 --> 06:15.240]  So I am stress testing these plants also many of the cultivars the plants the clones
[06:15.320 --> 06:22.060]  The selections that I am using have come from commercial cultivation facilities. I love all my
[06:22.600 --> 06:24.400]  bros and
[06:24.400 --> 06:29.640]  Female grower friends that work in these commercial cultivation facilities, but many of them are
[06:30.320 --> 06:34.440]  Young I love you guys. They're 24 25 26 years old
[06:34.440 --> 06:40.040]  Some of them are in their early 30s a lot of them like to have fun on the weekends a lot of them
[06:40.480 --> 06:44.740]  Allegedly maybe sometimes may take a couple too many dabs on their lunch break
[06:45.240 --> 06:52.040]  So shit happens in the commercial cultivation facilities and when shit happens the plants get seriously abused
[06:52.320 --> 06:58.000]  Sometimes also sometimes equipment fails HVAC will fail watering irrigation will fail
[06:58.560 --> 07:06.440]  Something will go wrong. I get to see a myriad of abuse and problems given to these plants via the grow tax
[07:06.600 --> 07:10.040]  Somebody may be stoned and forget to pH a whole batch of nutrients
[07:10.400 --> 07:13.320]  Somebody may be stoned and over water a whole fucking room
[07:13.640 --> 07:19.760]  Somebody may just forget to even show up to work that day. Sometimes shit happens in a commercial cultivation facility
[07:19.760 --> 07:22.520]  There are ramifications and repercussions for the staff
[07:22.520 --> 07:27.600]  But also the plants have issues that we've got to deal with I get to see the plants get abused is what I'm saying
[07:27.600 --> 07:31.440]  You guys I've seen them tortured in all sorts of ways you can and cannot imagine
[07:31.440 --> 07:35.880]  So I know what the plants are going to work with many of the plants I work with
[07:35.880 --> 07:39.680]  I've seen them in a commercial cultivation setting and I've gotten to watch them in
[07:40.440 --> 07:46.920]  the commercial cultivation in Pueblo West and the one in Springs the one in South Denver the one in North Glen I get to go
[07:46.920 --> 07:50.880]  To these different facilities and they've got the same cultivar in these facilities
[07:50.880 --> 07:56.620]  So I get to see it grown by four different lead growers. I get to see it abused by four different HVAC systems
[07:56.620 --> 08:00.640]  I get to see four different bug infestations. Whatever happens in a facility
[08:00.640 --> 08:03.840]  I get to see it four different times and over hundreds of plants
[08:03.840 --> 08:10.560]  So I've seen what will handle problems what will not handle problems? What is good for growing under high stress conditions?
[08:10.600 --> 08:13.680]  That's where I've selected my females that I'm using for breeding
[08:14.280 --> 08:18.600]  So they're not hermaphrodites. They're able to take abuse. They take stress very well
[08:18.600 --> 08:25.040]  They grow with good vigor and also I think they're good plants since they work in a commercial environment where we I
[08:25.320 --> 08:29.360]  Would love to say we can pay attention to every single plant. Sometimes shit gets overlooked
[08:29.360 --> 08:33.520]  Like I said earlier we got young people who are having a good time working in there that music's loud
[08:33.520 --> 08:38.120]  We're going fast shit happens. I lost train of that thought but shit happens
[08:38.120 --> 08:40.800]  I'm may need to fucking press pause and figure out where I was
[08:42.600 --> 08:47.460]  I'm selecting these plants from a commercial cultivation facility. So I've seen a lot of problems
[08:47.460 --> 08:49.840]  I know they're gonna grow well since the grow techs
[08:50.160 --> 08:53.360]  That show up late and stone and have a lot of plants to handle
[08:53.360 --> 08:58.500]  Some of them are overloaded and I'm bombarded with work if they can handle hundreds of these plants
[08:58.500 --> 09:04.100]  I know that when I breed to them a grower who is new at growing will definitely have good success with a small batch
[09:04.100 --> 09:07.980]  Of these plants. They're good successful plants is what I think I'm trying to say with a good
[09:08.100 --> 09:15.820]  They've been vetted by myself and by several other commercial growers. So they're verified qualified plants. They are not hermaphrodites
[09:15.820 --> 09:17.820]  They are not males. They don't have problems
[09:17.820 --> 09:24.020]  Those are the plants that I start with the main most important thing I think is starting with trusted breeding stock
[09:24.020 --> 09:30.260]  You can't make a good cake with shitty ingredients. You can't have champions without good fucking champion stock
[09:30.260 --> 09:33.540]  I don't know what I'm saying, but you need good plants to begin with so
[09:34.100 --> 09:38.700]  Let's say we've got two qualified plants. Let's say we've got one qualified plant
[09:38.700 --> 09:41.220]  We're gonna start with one that we want to make feminized seeds from
[09:42.420 --> 09:45.420]  Let's kind of go through the process of how I do this
[09:45.780 --> 09:50.820]  The selected cut is I would take two clones if I just want to make a small batch of fem seeds
[09:50.820 --> 09:56.700]  I've got one plant I take two clones. I grow them. I veg them they get about the size where I'm ready to flower
[09:56.860 --> 09:58.580]  here's where the
[09:58.580 --> 10:00.980]  feminization process kicks in the
[10:01.460 --> 10:05.300]  One of the selected cuts is treated with silver thiosulfate
[10:05.980 --> 10:10.180]  That is a blend of silver nitrate and sodium thiosulfate
[10:10.180 --> 10:14.240]  Those are two products that are available for purchase on the internet if you know where to look
[10:14.620 --> 10:17.100]  They are not very dangerous if you're safe with them
[10:17.100 --> 10:21.260]  You can cause problems if you inhale them, just be careful follow the safety
[10:21.820 --> 10:26.060]  Precautions on the containers and you will be fine wear a mask or some gloves. You'll be okay
[10:26.060 --> 10:32.540]  You're probably wearing a mask today. Anyway, don't worry about it. So I mix up my own silver thiosulfate solution
[10:32.860 --> 10:36.460]  Then it is diluted to specific dilutions
[10:36.500 --> 10:43.180]  Then it is applied via a spray I spray it directly onto the plant by itself without a surfactant
[10:43.180 --> 10:50.060]  I'm applying diluted silver thiosulfate solution onto a plant at very specific dilutions and
[10:50.380 --> 10:56.780]  Very specific intervals. What does that mean? The strength of my solution varies based on the plant
[10:56.780 --> 11:03.660]  I am trying to reverse some plants want really strong solutions. Some plants really freak out if you spray them too strong
[11:03.660 --> 11:07.980]  They need a lighter solution more times. It is kind of you have to learn the plant
[11:07.980 --> 11:13.620]  So, what do I mean by intervals I spray it at a very very carefully scheduled time
[11:13.620 --> 11:16.220]  I know exactly which day those plants are getting sprayed
[11:16.220 --> 11:22.660]  I can tell you how many times each plant that I reverse will get sprayed if I've worked with it a couple of times
[11:22.660 --> 11:27.260]  Excuse me. I'm choking on my own words if I've worked with a plant reversing it several times
[11:27.260 --> 11:31.260]  I have already got a good idea a notebook a recipe in my head somewhere
[11:31.260 --> 11:36.620]  I've got it written down and marked down that I know it needs this dilution and needs to be sprayed this many times for optimal
[11:36.780 --> 11:40.300]  pollen production if you spray with too hard of a
[11:41.060 --> 11:43.060]  Solution too strong of a solution
[11:43.380 --> 11:47.980]  Sometimes the plants will produce pollen sacks, but they will not produce any pollen
[11:47.980 --> 11:54.460]  You'll get a really pollen saki plant nothing comes out of it. If you don't use a strong enough solution, obviously, it doesn't reverse
[11:54.500 --> 11:59.860]  So you've got to find the balance some plants want to be sprayed really hard a couple of times
[11:59.940 --> 12:06.340]  Some plants want to be sprayed really lightly a bunch of times some plants want to be sprayed really hard a lot of times
[12:06.340 --> 12:09.780]  It's all about the plant and what it takes to reverse that plant
[12:10.100 --> 12:10.740]  You know
[12:10.740 --> 12:14.300]  The only way to learn that is by doing it to that specific plant and watching the plant
[12:14.580 --> 12:19.500]  Sometimes the leaves will crinkle up and it looks like you just shocked that plant with a fucking laser
[12:19.860 --> 12:26.020]  You've gone a little bit too hard, but oftentimes those plants make a lot of great pollen. We're not going for looks
[12:26.020 --> 12:32.240]  We're going for pollen. So it's all about pollen production is the main goal. So I mix up silver thiosulfate
[12:32.280 --> 12:37.960]  I dilute it to specific dilutions and I spray at specific intervals when I spray I
[12:38.280 --> 12:42.880]  Spray the shit out of the plant. I remove the plant that is going to get sprayed out of the grow space
[12:42.880 --> 12:47.840]  So it is the only one to get sprayed. I soak it to the point of runoff. That plant is dripping
[12:47.840 --> 12:51.280]  There's a puddle on the floor around the plant. I really soak it
[12:51.280 --> 12:57.500]  I also make sure to spray the sticks and the main stock. I don't just focus on the leaves
[12:57.620 --> 13:02.380]  I want to get a lot of silver into this plant. So I'm using silver thiosulfate
[13:02.900 --> 13:10.960]  The thiosulfate acts as a carrier the silver cannot penetrate the leaf surface and get into the plant the thiosulfate makes it more
[13:11.420 --> 13:15.180]  Bio available for the plant I guess you want to say is I don't know if that's the correct word
[13:15.180 --> 13:18.060]  It makes it more gives it better penetration for the leaf surface
[13:18.580 --> 13:24.340]  That gets this silver into the plant. The silver is the active ingredient that is going to work the magic
[13:24.460 --> 13:28.060]  So I've selected proper plants I have mixed up a solution
[13:28.060 --> 13:34.340]  I have made a schedule and I've applied my solution at the proper schedule. I've applied to runoff
[13:34.460 --> 13:38.340]  We've gotten silver thiosulfate into the plant. The silver is into the plant now
[13:38.340 --> 13:45.020]  Let's talk about how and why this feminization process works. I've just sprayed the plants with silver
[13:45.900 --> 13:50.380]  Silver stops the copper movement within the plant. There is copper moving in the plant
[13:50.380 --> 13:56.060]  We feed the plants lots of minerals lots of elements copper is one of the things that is abundant and moving within our plants
[13:56.060 --> 13:59.900]  I don't know that abundant was the appropriate word. It is present and moving within our plants
[14:00.500 --> 14:02.380]  when I disrupt
[14:02.380 --> 14:09.980]  Disrupt the copper movement by spraying the silver thiosulfate that disruption triggers an ethylene response
[14:10.860 --> 14:16.720]  Ethylene is a hormone that triggers and I just wrote down a lot of different reactions in
[14:17.000 --> 14:22.020]  Different species of plants and if you research what ethylene does in plants it has a lot of different
[14:22.640 --> 14:26.480]  Functions and triggers in plants it makes some plants ripen
[14:26.480 --> 14:29.520]  It has a lot to do a lot to do with ripening and senescence in
[14:30.160 --> 14:31.400]  cannabis
[14:31.400 --> 14:34.760]  It makes cannabis think that the end is near it goes
[14:34.760 --> 14:39.160]  I'm ripening for some reason and I wasn't ready to ripen. I'm not sure what to do
[14:40.120 --> 14:44.360]  Cannabis is main goal is to reproduce just like a lot of us
[14:44.360 --> 14:47.800]  All it wants to do is reproduce so a female cannabis plant
[14:47.800 --> 14:51.960]  Its only instinct is to survive it wants to make the only way it can reproduce
[14:51.960 --> 14:57.720]  The only way it can survive is to make seeds so that next year those seeds can grow and it can carry on its generation
[14:58.520 --> 15:03.200]  So when we freak this plant out it kind of panics and it goes I don't really know what to do
[15:03.200 --> 15:06.960]  I may die. My hormones are all fucked up. I'm scared of life right now
[15:07.160 --> 15:12.600]  Here's what I'm gonna do and it makes pollen sacks because it's already got the female we've got a female plant
[15:12.600 --> 15:14.760]  It's already got the female sex part so that it can breed
[15:14.760 --> 15:20.760]  It makes pollen sacks to where now it's got the part of the breeding that it was missing now that plan is self-sufficient
[15:21.900 --> 15:28.020]  People are gonna say you've got pollen sacks. You've got a hermaphrodite. You've got a male. No, there are no male
[15:28.400 --> 15:31.280]  Chromosomes present because I have selected a tried-and-true
[15:31.520 --> 15:38.000]  Solid female and we have proven that by my stress testing earlier by messing up the light schedule by overfeeding it by giving it
[15:38.000 --> 15:42.760]  Too much cold. I didn't talk too much about stress testing, but light is the main way I do overfeed
[15:42.760 --> 15:46.320]  I give it cold. I give it heat give it too much co2. I don't give it co2
[15:46.320 --> 15:50.560]  I withhold waterings stress them out. I let fucking the guys at the grow grow them
[15:50.560 --> 15:55.240]  They will stress them for you and tell you what stresses those plants out. So it is not a hermaphrodite
[15:55.240 --> 15:57.880]  It is not a male. It is not showing intersex traits
[15:58.000 --> 16:03.800]  This is a female that has been treated with a chemical that is now hormonally reacting by producing pollen sacks
[16:04.320 --> 16:10.400]  Those pollen sacks contain pollen, but the magic part is there are no male
[16:11.040 --> 16:18.840]  Chromosomes within that pollen. There is no male pollen. All of the pollen in here is female our friend
[16:18.840 --> 16:20.720]  Mr. Soul made a great analogy
[16:20.720 --> 16:27.060]  He said just imagine if you put your female plant here and your pollen donating plant here in this case
[16:27.060 --> 16:32.700]  It's a reversed female and we put a filter between them. It would only filter out male pollen
[16:32.700 --> 16:38.180]  That is basically what we have learned to do by creating feminized pollen. There is no male pollen
[16:38.180 --> 16:40.660]  No male chromosomes available in this exchange
[16:41.340 --> 16:47.820]  So now I've created female all female pollen X X pollen. There's no wise
[16:48.280 --> 16:50.400]  No males allowed no boys allowed
[16:50.400 --> 16:55.500]  This is all girls club in this situation if I have done my selections properly
[16:55.500 --> 17:02.580]  And I think my track record shows that I am pretty damn good at selecting female plants for feminized seed
[17:02.960 --> 17:07.340]  Production. So at this point we have got female or feminized pollen
[17:08.560 --> 17:14.200]  That is the basic beginning of making feminized seeds. That is where it all starts. It's all about the female pollen
[17:14.200 --> 17:19.440]  So I've taken silver I've taken selected plants made my solution applied the solution and that
[17:19.840 --> 17:26.720]  Silver has created an ethylene a copper disruption was created an ethylene response which triggered the plants to create pollen sacks
[17:26.720 --> 17:28.560]  That is kind of the short condensed version
[17:28.560 --> 17:33.560]  But for you guys to understand that's really all you need to know if you want to read more I encourage it because it's really
[17:33.560 --> 17:34.920]  fun learning about
[17:34.920 --> 17:38.560]  Hormones and ethylene and plants you'll really open up your mind to learning more
[17:38.560 --> 17:43.280]  So at this point we have got a female plant that is now dropping
[17:43.640 --> 17:47.760]  Feminized pollen that is the first half of our breeding combination
[17:48.240 --> 17:51.840]  Remember earlier I said we were going to take two clones of the same plant now
[17:51.840 --> 17:56.660]  We've got one it is reversed when we treat it with the silver thiosulfate and it starts changing its sex
[17:56.660 --> 18:01.680]  We have now reversed the sex. It's kind of gotten a sex change, but we just call it reversed to be polite
[18:01.780 --> 18:04.080]  So now we've got the one reversed plant
[18:04.080 --> 18:09.600]  We've got the remaining clone that we have not done anything to it is growing just like it normally should
[18:09.880 --> 18:12.200]  Maybe we've bottomed it and cleaned it up a little bit
[18:12.200 --> 18:17.000]  Maybe you topped it to get more tops whatever you want to do to keep that plant growing happily and healthily
[18:17.320 --> 18:19.360]  Now it is time to put the plants into flower
[18:20.440 --> 18:22.800]  You've got a couple of options here things you can do
[18:22.800 --> 18:27.560]  You can either collect the pollen from the reversed plant and store it and then apply it later
[18:27.600 --> 18:33.000]  But what I would prefer to do is just put that plant in the room along with the females that are going to get pollinated
[18:33.080 --> 18:34.840]  so in
[18:34.840 --> 18:39.080]  This situation you need if since I am choosing to put the male in the plant with the girls
[18:39.080 --> 18:45.080]  I need to get him pollinating get him started ahead of time for the females. He's going to take a while to produce pollen
[18:45.600 --> 18:47.280]  reversed plants
[18:47.280 --> 18:54.160]  Tend to take about two weeks ten to ten days to two weeks longer to drop pollen than a standard
[18:54.360 --> 19:00.120]  True male plant a male plant will start putting out pollen sometimes day 10 12
[19:00.120 --> 19:05.280]  But hopefully around day 14 17 you start getting pollen around day 23 to 30
[19:05.280 --> 19:08.160]  You're really pollinating with a reversed plant
[19:08.160 --> 19:13.160]  I generally don't get pollen until days 25 to 32 ish
[19:13.760 --> 19:19.880]  Sometimes a little bit later depending on the cultivar and how well I reversed her sometimes if I'm learning
[19:19.880 --> 19:24.760]  It'll take a little longer and it I honestly don't get a lot of pollen from reversed plants
[19:24.760 --> 19:28.480]  That's why they are a little bit more pricey than the regular seeds
[19:28.680 --> 19:34.640]  So the normal male plant will pollinate much earlier the reversed plant pollinates around day
[19:35.440 --> 19:38.800]  26 to 35 ish hopefully somewhere in that area
[19:39.120 --> 19:45.680]  So what we've got to do is we've got to get him going and flower and starting to produce his pollen way before the females
[19:46.040 --> 19:50.080]  Here is a trick that I usually charge money to tell people but I love you guys
[19:50.080 --> 19:54.160]  And if you've listened to this this far you deserve this tip when I am making
[19:54.480 --> 19:58.000]  Feminized seeds the way that I time it properly I
[19:58.480 --> 20:05.120]  Do not put my females in the flowering chamber until my reversal has begin to solidly
[20:05.280 --> 20:11.920]  Show me some male parts once I've got some pollen sacks and some balls popping up and I'm certain that my reversal is working
[20:12.040 --> 20:14.520]  That's when I'll move the girls into the flowering room
[20:15.160 --> 20:19.360]  Sometimes if you move them into there too early the females miss their peak
[20:19.600 --> 20:25.200]  Pollination point and then it takes too long for that reversal to start dumping pollen you get very little pollen
[20:25.200 --> 20:30.800]  You also get very little pollen reception. You get very little seed production and it is not worth your time and space
[20:31.120 --> 20:34.520]  I'm a commercial seed producer. I've got to time it out very well
[20:34.520 --> 20:39.960]  So as soon as I see that guy not as soon but I know when when I see the guy making his balls the girl
[20:39.960 --> 20:44.480]  Making her balls. I know that it's fucking gets confusing when you got these things going on, but it's 2020
[20:45.440 --> 20:51.280]  When my females start showing her balls, I said that think about that when my female plant starts showing her balls
[20:51.360 --> 20:58.600]  That's when I move my other females into the room to receive the pollen now that plants going to drop pollen onto my girls
[20:58.600 --> 21:04.680]  that happens just like a male and female the I guess you can consider the pollen is the sperm and the
[21:05.160 --> 21:10.040]  Pistols and the ovules are the female parts the ovaries inside of a lady
[21:10.040 --> 21:14.840]  So we just got to get the jizz in there. So we get the reversed pollen onto the female plant
[21:14.840 --> 21:20.640]  I keep saying female because there is no male. That's how we are making feminized seeds. So we're pollinating
[21:21.160 --> 21:27.800]  We have now taken the pollen from the reversed plant and put that pollen all over the at the right time at the appropriate time
[21:27.800 --> 21:33.660]  Somewhere probably around day 18 to 23 25 on the flowering plant is when you want that pollen to hit
[21:33.880 --> 21:40.000]  Day 32 is probably like around when it's way too fucking late. So get it around 18 23 25
[21:40.120 --> 21:45.120]  Somewhere in that area depending on the cultivar pollinate now we have pollinated now
[21:45.120 --> 21:49.880]  This is where we have two different options. Of course in my example, I said we're going to use the same cut
[21:49.880 --> 21:52.000]  So let's talk about that. What we have now done is
[21:52.520 --> 21:58.240]  Called selfing a plant the best way I can say this for you to remember is that plant just fucked itself
[21:58.280 --> 22:03.240]  It jizzed in itself and it made clones of itself. It didn't make clones. It made seeds of itself
[22:03.240 --> 22:06.520]  I shouldn't have said clones. That's the wrong word disregard the word clones. I'm gonna move forward
[22:06.920 --> 22:13.040]  It made reproductions of itself it made offspring progeny of itself we selfed that plant
[22:13.280 --> 22:16.240]  There are a lot of reasons why we could do this and a lot of benefits
[22:16.880 --> 22:21.360]  I've got a lot of favorite plants, but I cannot keep every plant
[22:21.360 --> 22:26.120]  So right now I would like to cycle a couple of plants out and a couple of plants in
[22:26.480 --> 22:29.920]  Let's just say that I want to I'm not gonna do it. So nobody freak out
[22:29.920 --> 22:34.180]  Let's say I want to get rid of the grateful dog because I don't have space. I want to get rid of it
[22:34.180 --> 22:37.940]  I want to call two plants bring in two more if I want to get rid of grateful dog
[22:37.940 --> 22:39.940]  But I'm afraid to lose it forever
[22:39.940 --> 22:45.780]  One thing I could do is self it take two clones make pollen put the pollen on the same plant now
[22:45.780 --> 22:53.220]  I've got self seeds. There is no adulteration of genetics. So I have preserved my grateful dog when I want it later
[22:53.220 --> 22:55.220]  It's over there in a bag in the vault
[22:55.220 --> 22:59.700]  All I got to do is grow some seeds and find the one that I really like grateful dog is back in the rotation
[22:59.700 --> 23:04.220]  I've got seeds for preservation. So that is a really good way to preserve
[23:04.780 --> 23:08.540]  Across and not adulterated. What do I mean by adulterating it?
[23:08.820 --> 23:14.500]  We want a lot of people want golden goat seeds, but there is not a golden goat male available
[23:14.740 --> 23:21.500]  Also, here's something I want to touch on briefly. There is no golden go or there's no Gorilla Glue for male available
[23:21.500 --> 23:26.400]  So if you say you've got Gorilla Glue for seeds and their regular seeds you do not that is fake. That's not a thing
[23:26.840 --> 23:33.680]  Gorilla Glue for was a clone only phenotype so you cannot have regular seeds of Gorilla Glue for there's no boy
[23:33.680 --> 23:38.080]  It is adulterated. There's something else crossed into it. It could be a bat cross
[23:38.080 --> 23:44.160]  It could be a fem seed GG for purely not a possibility golden goat purely not a possibility
[23:44.160 --> 23:48.440]  There was not a male of those released. So nobody's making pure unadulterated seeds
[23:48.600 --> 23:54.080]  So now we can make unadulterated golden goat feminized seeds we can make unadulterated
[23:55.080 --> 23:59.280]  Grateful dog feminized seeds and store them for preservation in the future
[23:59.280 --> 24:01.900]  Also, if people want to grow that golden goat
[24:01.900 --> 24:08.000]  They've got a really good opportunity of getting the phenotype that they see me post because I haven't added any other ingredients
[24:08.360 --> 24:15.480]  Into the fucking the recipe. It's still golden goat if I wanted to make seeds of it and not feminize it
[24:15.480 --> 24:21.000]  I would have to find a male of something else and now it is golden goat cross to whatever not pure golden
[24:21.000 --> 24:22.480]  Goat kind of fucks it up for you
[24:22.480 --> 24:29.680]  So that is called selfing when you take one plant reverse it put the pollen on a cultivar of the same type
[24:29.680 --> 24:34.160]  It's got to be the same plant golden goat to golden goat grateful dog to grateful dog
[24:35.280 --> 24:39.080]  Whatever that's as far as blueberry cookies to blueberry cookies now
[24:39.080 --> 24:44.760]  There is another thing that we do with feminized pollen. We put the feminized pollen on
[24:45.280 --> 24:47.040]  different cultivars
[24:47.040 --> 24:49.820]  So if I put the golden goat pollen on
[24:50.340 --> 24:58.080]  Lemon Jeffrey there on the lemon skunk that makes lemon Jeffrey golden goat pollen on a lemon skunk female makes feminized
[24:58.200 --> 25:00.200]  lemon Jeffrey seeds
[25:00.480 --> 25:02.360]  that is called a
[25:02.360 --> 25:09.520]  Reversal or an r1 that indicates the difference between selfing and using the pollen on another plant
[25:09.800 --> 25:13.680]  What we have done there is we have created a brand new hybrid
[25:13.680 --> 25:20.720]  We have made a new line and we didn't have to use a male plant in that so we've got a feminized brand new hybrid
[25:20.720 --> 25:25.300]  So instead of calling it an f1 or an s1, which is what we would call a self project
[25:25.300 --> 25:32.000]  This is now an r1 to indicate to my customers and people reading about it that this is a reversed
[25:32.280 --> 25:35.200]  Feminized cross there was not a male used it was an R
[25:35.240 --> 25:42.480]  So the S indicates selfed and if I say s1 that's the selfed first generation if I say R
[25:42.480 --> 25:47.440]  That is the reversed first generation r1 is a first generation reversal
[25:47.600 --> 25:52.240]  So I think that covers the basics of fem seeds really quickly
[25:53.320 --> 26:00.880]  Important is selection. The most important part is selection select solid females then make your silver thiosulfate solution
[26:00.920 --> 26:05.480]  The next important part is learning the dilutions and application intervals and rates
[26:05.920 --> 26:07.920]  Apply your silver silver thiosulfate
[26:08.400 --> 26:14.520]  Then you've got to time out your males and females get the male dumping pollen get the females ready to receive pollen at the same
[26:14.520 --> 26:16.520]  Time then you've got to pollinate
[26:17.080 --> 26:23.600]  Then everything else if you're breeding if you're growing seeds everything else happens just the same as it did with regular seeds
[26:23.800 --> 26:26.940]  You're pollinating just like you are any other crop
[26:27.680 --> 26:31.120]  We're going to make self seeds or we're going to make reversed seeds
[26:31.240 --> 26:35.800]  There is no reason why you cannot put so if I wanted to reverse golden goat
[26:35.800 --> 26:41.440]  I could reverse the golden goat put a clone of golden goat in the room put a clone of platinum tangy in the room and
[26:41.440 --> 26:45.880]  Put a clone of lemon skunk in the room and now I can make golden goat fems
[26:46.120 --> 26:51.640]  Lemon skunk or lemon Jeffrey fems and also platinum. It's the sun kiss fems. I got a lot of shit my brain right now
[26:51.640 --> 26:52.400]  I'm trying to keep it all straight
[26:52.400 --> 26:56.520]  But I can make three different lines of fem seeds from that one golden goat
[26:56.720 --> 27:03.800]  Reversed plant and that's why you see me making multiple crosses the red pill the blue pill is a golden goat feminized cross
[27:04.360 --> 27:10.140]  Lemon Jeffrey platinum tangy the golden goat. There are several of them the garlic goat, which was kind of rare
[27:10.140 --> 27:16.960]  That's been going out. Those are all feminized golden goat crosses and many of them happen in the same room at the same time
[27:16.960 --> 27:19.000]  I don't have to breed just golden goat to golden goat
[27:19.000 --> 27:22.320]  I can put multiple girls in there and make a lot of great crosses
[27:22.360 --> 27:28.040]  So when I do golden goat to golden goat just to recap and keep it in your brain that is a self it is fucking
[27:28.040 --> 27:33.940]  Itself, I know that's crass, but you're not gonna forget if I pollinate anything else with that pollen
[27:33.940 --> 27:40.860]  That is a reversal and those will both be feminized and here's where I'm going to reiterate. They are not hermaphrodites
[27:42.720 --> 27:48.020]  99.9% of the feminized seeds I produce are true feminized seeds
[27:48.020 --> 27:54.820]  There's 0.1% that gives me the opportunity for complaints and error. I don't get the complaints and fucking problems
[27:54.820 --> 27:58.100]  you guys nobody sends me emails saying I bought fem seeds and I've got
[27:58.340 --> 28:05.620]  Hermaphrodites or I've got problems because I feel like my process first of all, I keep reiterating that selection process
[28:05.620 --> 28:10.520]  I feel like that process is solid. I feel like my reversal process is solid
[28:10.620 --> 28:15.380]  Then here's something the next step for a breeder for anybody making fem seeds
[28:15.380 --> 28:20.500]  Here is the next most important step for you to do you have got to grow them yourself
[28:20.660 --> 28:24.520]  Do not give them to friends. Do not sell them. Don't donate them
[28:25.020 --> 28:28.940]  You may be setting people you may be giving them fucking dynamite for their grow room
[28:28.940 --> 28:34.420]  You may have just given them a big batch of hermaphrodite seeds of intersex seeds. They're gonna put them in the grow
[28:34.420 --> 28:38.500]  They may not be experienced growers. They're gonna have it grow and you told them feminized
[28:38.500 --> 28:43.000]  They're not even looking for males then guess what first day a week three kapow
[28:43.120 --> 28:45.200]  Everything is pollinated because you're done fucked up
[28:45.200 --> 28:49.720]  so your responsibility as a breeder a pollen chucker a
[28:49.920 --> 28:55.200]  Cannabis community member somebody who's trying to help is to grow the seeds you made yourself
[28:55.760 --> 28:59.160]  Grow them see what you've got if you get one
[28:59.800 --> 29:04.920]  Hermaphrodite one intersex plant out of that batch of seeds you need to reconsider what you're going to do
[29:05.000 --> 29:07.400]  Do you want to put that out there to the community?
[29:07.800 --> 29:14.560]  One batch of herm seeds can ruin a seed company's reputation for the entire future
[29:14.560 --> 29:18.400]  You can be on top of the world and if you release one line of herms
[29:18.400 --> 29:21.840]  You may have just ruined your seed company for the rest of your career
[29:21.840 --> 29:26.720]  You'll still sell some seeds, but people will be very reluctant very hesitant
[29:26.720 --> 29:31.360]  They will come looking at me for my femme seeds because I've got a better reputation. I'm not trying to brag
[29:31.360 --> 29:34.640]  I'm just saying that's how it goes. I've seen it done in this industry
[29:34.640 --> 29:40.360]  There's a breeder who was fucking killing it for several years putting out femmes. I don't know what went wrong
[29:40.360 --> 29:42.360]  He got a lot of complaints about
[29:42.720 --> 29:48.440]  Problematic fucking plants now. I don't see him at events. I don't see his booth anywhere. He kind of disappeared
[29:48.440 --> 29:53.080]  I know he's still online selling seeds, but he doesn't go to the event. He doesn't want to put his face out there
[29:53.080 --> 29:57.760]  He would probably get a long line of people yelling at him and another line of people trying to buy seed
[29:57.760 --> 30:02.120]  So he just stays at home and clicks on the internet does his sales that way so be careful
[30:02.120 --> 30:07.040]  It is your responsibility to make sure that the seeds you created are worth a shit grow them
[30:07.200 --> 30:11.320]  They have to be better or as good as the parent plant if you're making
[30:11.840 --> 30:16.120]  Self seeds make sure they look like the fucking plant you're promising people
[30:16.120 --> 30:21.160]  They're gonna look like you will see this is a good way to segue into this. You'll see a little bit of variation
[30:21.800 --> 30:28.360]  We're not introducing another cross into there, but Golden Goats got parents. It's got a mom. It's got a dad
[30:28.360 --> 30:32.920]  It's got two grandparents on either side. You may see recessive traits
[30:32.920 --> 30:36.760]  You may see a little bit of variation when it comes to your fems
[30:36.760 --> 30:43.320]  That depends on the parent plant that you choose to work with when you're making selves. There will be little variation
[30:43.560 --> 30:46.400]  Hopefully but it is possible when you're working with the reversals
[30:46.400 --> 30:52.240]  You are going to see a little bit of the female and a little bit of the reversal come through you're gonna get mostly
[30:52.520 --> 30:56.320]  5050s, but you'll find a really dominant phenotype in that mix
[30:56.360 --> 31:01.920]  So if you don't make a phenotype that is as good or better than your starting parent stock
[31:01.920 --> 31:06.820]  You did not do a successful breeding project. You have not done anything improving
[31:06.820 --> 31:10.440]  You just fucking made a copy or you just kind of made a bunch of seeds
[31:10.440 --> 31:16.540]  You've got to improve cannabis to call yourself a breeder have a goal have an intention and make improvement
[31:16.540 --> 31:23.040]  Don't take us backward in the evolution of cannabis. Please move us forward and once again, they're not hermaphrodites
[31:23.040 --> 31:28.720]  There is no if the hurt word herm is available in this situation. You fucked up. Don't breed with herms
[31:28.720 --> 31:32.280]  Don't make herms don't sell herms if the seeds are hermaphrodites
[31:32.280 --> 31:35.480]  If you get more than if you grow a hundred and you get two herms out of there
[31:35.480 --> 31:40.140]  You're getting 2% and that is beyond the threshold of allowance for hermaphroditic seeds
[31:40.280 --> 31:46.940]  You've either got to cross that back again get a good female and then reverse your original mom and fucking redo it now
[31:46.940 --> 31:50.400]  You've got like a femme fucking back cross thing going on, which would it'll work
[31:50.600 --> 31:57.000]  But I would abandon the project all the way because that means that there is hermaphroditism present in that line of genes
[31:57.000 --> 32:01.140]  I wouldn't even fuck with it or maybe at least try a different phenotype of that
[32:01.140 --> 32:05.220]  But if you've got a different phenotype, why are you making fems? So abandon it? That is my idea
[32:05.360 --> 32:09.020]  Don't be ashamed or afraid to abandon a breeding project
[32:09.840 --> 32:11.840]  It is more
[32:12.080 --> 32:15.960]  admirable respectable to say this batch of seeds and shit
[32:16.160 --> 32:21.340]  Flush or feed them to the bunny or whatever you got make hemp seeds out of a make some seed sprout tea
[32:21.340 --> 32:26.040]  Maybe you can make some fucking Korean fucking natural farming sort of stuff out of it, but don't sell them
[32:26.040 --> 32:29.000]  don't give them to people don't expect people to put that in their gardens because as a
[32:29.320 --> 32:34.340]  Breeder we want to are I want to I think our job our goal our purpose our mission
[32:34.960 --> 32:40.440]  We should be here setting people up for success. We should be making cannabis better. We should be making growing
[32:41.040 --> 32:45.940]  Easier more enjoyable more successful more pleasant for our clientele our customers
[32:45.940 --> 32:50.160]  Whatever you want to call more fucking friends or community our family the people that buy seeds for me
[32:50.160 --> 32:56.160]  Keep me alive. Keep me afloat. They keep fucking food in my belly and Nikes on my shoes and fucking they help my kid
[32:56.160 --> 33:00.180]  You know what? I mean? I got a fucking daughter. I got a drum set addiction. I got dabs to smoke
[33:00.240 --> 33:06.800]  So I really respect and appreciate my customers my clientele. They're my community. They're my friends
[33:06.800 --> 33:08.600]  I don't want to rip off my friends
[33:08.600 --> 33:13.120]  I would feel like a shitbag of a person if I sent out a batch of seeds and
[33:13.760 --> 33:18.600]  Anybody sent me a message going bro your seeds fucked up my garden these seeds you made
[33:19.360 --> 33:25.320]  Hermaphrodite it and put pollen on my fucking girls and I needed medicine and now I don't have medicine, dude
[33:25.320 --> 33:32.040]  I would I would probably grow a crop for them or buy them medicine if I did something like that
[33:32.040 --> 33:34.800]  Like that's how bad I would feel I I fucking feel things
[33:35.800 --> 33:39.800]  People work really hard for their money. First of all, they work hard for their money to buy the seeds
[33:40.520 --> 33:44.920]  Seeds are not cheap. Even if even if you get them directly from me at an event, they're still expensive
[33:44.920 --> 33:48.400]  That's several hours at your job slaving away doing some shit
[33:48.400 --> 33:52.520]  You didn't want to do for someone you didn't want to do it for in a condition. You didn't want to be in I get
[33:52.520 --> 33:55.400]  That I understand that so when you give me that money
[33:55.400 --> 34:00.200]  I want you to have a smile not just be satisfied with the seeds you got for the price
[34:00.280 --> 34:02.280]  But you need to be satisfied with the outcome
[34:02.280 --> 34:06.860]  You've got a lot to do with it. If you're just fucking pouring Red Bull and miracle growing your plants
[34:06.860 --> 34:10.200]  Don't ask me for help or do ask me for help. I'll fucking help you
[34:10.200 --> 34:12.120]  But if you fuck them up by doing that, that's your fault
[34:12.120 --> 34:15.600]  But if you get a shitty outcome on my fault, I feel really bad for it
[34:15.600 --> 34:20.320]  I think I made I think that comes by in my tone of voice and if you see the show you don't definitely know
[34:20.320 --> 34:25.700]  I'm sincere. So I want people to have great success with cannabis. That's why I breathe. That's why I do the show
[34:25.700 --> 34:31.720]  This show is free because I want everybody out there to grow the best ganja. They can we need to medicate?
[34:31.720 --> 34:34.800]  We need to recreate we just need to feel good feel iry and feel better
[34:34.800 --> 34:38.120]  So if you're making seeds make sure you are improving on
[34:38.360 --> 34:43.560]  Cannabis, make sure you're not making it worse because I'm doing a lot of work and a lot of our friends a lot of our
[34:43.560 --> 34:48.160]  Cohorts will call them colleagues. Maybe a better word. We're out there doing our best to make it better
[34:48.160 --> 34:51.960]  So if you're gonna breed, please do your best to improve on cannabis
[34:52.960 --> 34:58.000]  You guys I feel like that went by quite quickly. It looks like we're at about 35 30 ish minutes
[34:58.000 --> 35:00.000]  Maybe if I do a couple of edits in here
[35:00.000 --> 35:06.120]  I hope I covered everything. I hope I was clear and concise. I know I repeated several things not hermaphrodites
[35:06.120 --> 35:10.580]  Femme seeds are not my femme seeds are not made through hermaphroditism
[35:11.240 --> 35:15.560]  Hermaphroditism there is a method that some people use old-school Dutch methods
[35:15.760 --> 35:21.740]  We've kind of moved on from that those companies don't last they're not around any longer because they weren't feminizing properly
[35:21.740 --> 35:26.200]  I think we can trust most of the major companies that are available now making femme seeds
[35:26.800 --> 35:28.040]  so
[35:28.040 --> 35:30.040]  part of my mission here was to
[35:30.120 --> 35:35.360]  Dispel the myth that they're femmes that frustrates me because I work hard to make quality fems or that they're herm
[35:35.360 --> 35:38.680]  Sorry, they are not herms. I work very hard to make quality femmes and
[35:39.320 --> 35:41.000]  also, I
[35:41.000 --> 35:47.200]  Don't think that we need to be afraid of feminized seeds anymore and we need to quit bashing people who choose to grow femme seeds
[35:47.720 --> 35:49.100]  They are very useful
[35:49.100 --> 35:54.360]  Every plant you grow will be a viable plant if you get it to fruition if you take care of it
[35:54.360 --> 35:56.160]  Germs will probably get fruits out of it
[35:56.160 --> 36:00.240]  If you're growing reg seed, you got to cut down probably 50 to 60
[36:00.240 --> 36:03.320]  Maybe 70 percent of your fucking plants before they even get to flower
[36:03.320 --> 36:08.720]  So there is an advantage if you're in an area with limited plant counts or if you're in a small tent
[36:08.720 --> 36:13.600]  And you really rely on every one if your system if you've got a six plant setup and you need all of them
[36:13.600 --> 36:14.840]  Those fins are the way to go
[36:14.840 --> 36:16.200]  You don't want to have an empty pot
[36:16.200 --> 36:21.640]  Empty pots are expensive if you think about it that pot should be producing something and if you don't have something in there
[36:21.640 --> 36:26.640]  You're running lights. You're running your system. That empty pot is costing you whatever you would have produced. So
[36:27.280 --> 36:34.280]  Feminized do have a place. They're not fucking hermaphrodites. Please quit saying that I think that's all I've got for my feminized episode
[36:34.280 --> 36:37.200]  It is time to wrap it up. It sounds like my voice is giving me the same hint
[36:37.200 --> 36:39.120]  So I want to thank you guys for hanging out
[36:39.120 --> 36:42.340]  I'm a lot of people ask about where they can grab my feminized seeds
[36:42.340 --> 36:47.860]  I would highly recommend seeds here now calm of course use coupon code GF why H 10 at checkout
[36:47.860 --> 36:53.580]  That will save you 10% if you're getting a small order that will cover your taxes if you're getting a big order that will cover
[36:54.060 --> 36:57.060]  That should help you out quite a bit. I'd at least cover shipping
