[00:18.300 --> 00:23.780]  Hi-de-lee-ho, podcast world. I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is
[00:23.780 --> 00:30.160]  episode 670 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast. In this episode, I'm going to read a couple
[00:30.160 --> 00:34.040]  of grow questions. Before we get to that part of the show, you know I like to start off
[00:34.040 --> 00:39.700]  by doing a few shout outs to a few of those great folks who support the show on Patreon.
[00:39.700 --> 00:43.620]  Let's start off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to my friend
[00:43.620 --> 00:47.900]  the Painted Lady. Let's send a thank you shout out to Terp Arena Terpington at North North
[00:47.900 --> 00:52.060]  Terps. Big shout out to the whole Terp family. Let's send a big thank you shout out to my
[00:52.060 --> 00:56.820]  buddy Lefty and Mrs. Lefty's Farm. I want to send a thank you shout out to F1 Pete and
[00:56.820 --> 01:01.220]  Pearl Brewer Home Grower. Let's send a big fist bump and a thank you shout out to a longtime
[01:01.220 --> 01:05.300]  supporter my buddy OG Purple Thumb. I want to send a big thank you shout out to my buddy
[01:05.300 --> 01:09.260]  Aldridge. And then let's wrap it all up with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank
[01:09.260 --> 01:14.380]  you shout out to my buddy Dave's Not Here. Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
[01:14.380 --> 01:19.020]  who continues to support the show on Patreon. If you are not already supporting the show and you
[01:19.020 --> 01:26.460]  would like to learn how to do so all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow
[01:26.460 --> 01:30.460]  from your heart. All of the information you need is right there on the screen and you know I do
[01:30.460 --> 01:37.580]  include that link in the show notes and in the video description. I do cordially invite you to
[01:37.580 --> 01:42.700]  join us on the discord server. That's right there is a Grow From Your Heart podcast I read genetics
[01:42.700 --> 01:48.220]  discord server where right now about 1200 people have joined the discord. Some of those folks are
[01:48.220 --> 01:52.700]  hanging out at the live chat. Some of them are taking dabs taking bong rips in the live chat
[01:52.700 --> 01:57.660]  right now talking about life talking about growing and smoking iree genetics. If you need any
[01:57.660 --> 02:02.860]  conversation any chatter about growing or smoking any advice about growing or smoking any of my
[02:02.860 --> 02:08.700]  strains. I do highly recommend joining us on the discord server. I was hanging out earlier laughed
[02:08.700 --> 02:14.060]  my ass off on the server and the chat. It's a good time great crew over there. I do invite you
[02:14.060 --> 02:19.020]  to the discord server. There is a link to the discord server and the show notes and the video
[02:19.020 --> 02:24.940]  description and there is also a link on the website. That's right. I read genetics.com has a
[02:24.940 --> 02:29.660]  link to the discord server. It says discord click on that that will take you right to the discord
[02:29.660 --> 02:36.060]  server. You could join the crew join the party. It's a good time. While you are on the website.
[02:36.060 --> 02:40.220]  I do encourage you to sign up for the newsletter. That's right. There is a newsletter if you scroll
[02:40.220 --> 02:45.900]  down most of the way almost toward the bottom of the I read genetics website at I read genetics.com
[02:45.900 --> 02:50.620]  you will find a spot to sign up for a newsletter. It says keep in touch or stay up to date with I
[02:50.620 --> 02:55.660]  read genetics. Put in your email address there. Every time I send out a newsletter or send out
[02:55.660 --> 03:00.860]  an update or make a change that is important you will get notified. I just recently sent out a
[03:00.860 --> 03:05.420]  newsletter for the start of September. There are some new coupon codes, some vendor discount codes
[03:05.420 --> 03:10.540]  in there, some merchandise updates in there, some good news, some things like that. I try to keep you
[03:10.540 --> 03:15.900]  updated with those newsletters. I try not to bump bombard you overload your inbox. I try not to spam
[03:15.900 --> 03:20.220]  you, but I do try to give you some useful information. So I invite you and encourage you to
[03:20.220 --> 03:26.620]  join up for the newsletter on I read genetics.com. I think that is enough call to action part of the
[03:26.620 --> 03:35.340]  show. Let's go on with some thank yous. We recently the show recently hit 8000 subscribers on YouTube.
[03:35.340 --> 03:41.180]  That is a big number to me. This little podcast has reached 8000 subscribers on YouTube. Thank you.
[03:41.180 --> 03:45.340]  That means a lot to me. We're getting quite a few views, quite a few subscribers. The numbers are
[03:45.340 --> 03:50.620]  moving up. Progress is progress and it means a lot to me. Big salute, big shout out, big thanks to
[03:50.620 --> 03:55.820]  everybody who is supporting us on YouTube. Also big thanks to everybody listening on all of the
[03:55.820 --> 04:00.460]  audio formats. I do know that for a little while it was frustrating trying to find the show,
[04:00.460 --> 04:05.580]  listen to updated episodes on some of your formats. I do think to the best of my knowledge,
[04:05.580 --> 04:10.460]  we have corrected all of the audio formats. So you should be able to listen to your favorite podcast
[04:10.460 --> 04:15.980]  on your favorite service. If not, send me another message and I will do my best to get either myself
[04:15.980 --> 04:21.580]  or the web team web guy on it. We've been doing a lot of work getting things updated and corrected.
[04:21.580 --> 04:25.340]  So let me know if it is not on your favorite service. You may not even be hearing this.
[04:25.340 --> 04:29.740]  If the podcast is not available where you normally listen, when you do catch up on episodes,
[04:29.740 --> 04:36.220]  I apologize. We fixed, I think we fixed Podbean. I think we fixed Stitcher. Say fixed Stitcher a
[04:36.220 --> 04:40.700]  couple of times fast when you're stoned. That's a good one. I think we fixed Google Podcasts. I
[04:40.700 --> 04:45.420]  think we fixed all of it, but I don't know. It works on my end. Sometimes I get messages from
[04:45.420 --> 04:48.700]  people with like an Android phone and they're like, hey, it still doesn't work and there are
[04:48.700 --> 04:52.780]  corrections to be made. Let us know. We will happily make the corrections if you let us know.
[04:52.780 --> 04:58.220]  But the point was big thank you to everybody for 8,000 subscribers on YouTube. We're going to get
[04:58.220 --> 05:01.660]  a plaque at 10,000 or something like that. I don't really know what happens on being
[05:01.660 --> 05:05.100]  facetious is the word, but they're going to send us a watch and a trophy and we're going to have
[05:05.100 --> 05:09.900]  a party at 10,000. But thank you guys. And also big thanks to everybody for all of the support
[05:09.900 --> 05:14.220]  on all of the audio servers. But I do invite you guys, if you're only listening, I invite you to
[05:14.220 --> 05:18.780]  come check out the video podcast. It's a great show. Sometimes I do bust out some plants. I do
[05:18.780 --> 05:23.260]  a lot of fancy hand movements. Come see the cool backdrop I've got behind me, the cool lighting.
[05:23.260 --> 05:27.420]  Just enjoy the video, at least subscribe on YouTube so we can get some clicks and some counts
[05:28.060 --> 05:33.260]  for that much. All right. Enough chatter. I did say I've got some listener content,
[05:33.260 --> 05:37.980]  some emails and stuff like that to focus on in this episode. Let's move into that portion of
[05:37.980 --> 05:42.860]  the show. This one came from our friend Matt and it goes a lot like this. It says, Hey,
[05:42.860 --> 05:48.220]  Rasta Jeff, I love your genetics and I'm just a small time grower running semi stealth in three
[05:48.220 --> 05:53.100]  tents. That's as stealth as it's going to get, bro. Four tents makes it not stealth because the
[05:53.100 --> 05:57.740]  electricity bill gets too high. Then it says, I want to try to not only save my genetics,
[05:57.740 --> 06:03.260]  but start trying to find different cultivars that will get you, uh, give me a nice buzz with a good
[06:03.260 --> 06:06.780]  head high. That's not what he typed, but that's what I'm going to say here. I think we're still
[06:06.780 --> 06:10.300]  in the nice boy clock. If you know what I mean, if you know anything about the nice boy clock,
[06:10.300 --> 06:15.500]  big fist bump and big shout out to the nice boy clock. Um, it goes on. It says, I want a nice buzz
[06:15.500 --> 06:21.580]  with a good head high, as well as a line geared toward more fighting cancer and inflammation and
[06:21.580 --> 06:27.580]  pain. So you need something, a cultivar that will give you a good head buzz, um, and a good head
[06:27.580 --> 06:33.740]  high. And you want something that, Oh, and as well as fight cancer and inflammation and pain. So
[06:33.740 --> 06:39.660]  something I don't, I'm not the expert on cannabis for cancer. I don't know exactly what you need for
[06:39.660 --> 06:43.740]  that. Most of the time we just mix a bunch of things together and make an RSO or something
[06:43.740 --> 06:48.700]  like that. Like I said, I'm not the expert on cannabis for cancer. Uh, fortunately I haven't
[06:48.700 --> 06:53.260]  had to fight that and experience that or deal with that yet. Uh, but for inflammation and pain,
[06:53.260 --> 06:57.260]  there are a lot of great strains that'll do that. Uh, so it goes on. It says, so I've got kind of a
[06:57.260 --> 07:02.620]  two-part question, really. Number one, if I wanted to use some of your genetics as a base of my
[07:02.620 --> 07:08.780]  seeds after research and selection, do I need to seek your permission? And after strains are honed,
[07:08.780 --> 07:13.340]  okay, so that's a two-part question in the first question. Then after the seeds, after the strains
[07:13.340 --> 07:17.740]  are honed, would you ever want some of those seeds to work with? And then he says, I'm expecting at
[07:17.740 --> 07:22.940]  least three years minimum. Uh, three years is probably the long track. Those F1 seeds will be
[07:22.940 --> 07:28.220]  cool. You can send me some of the F1s. That'll take a 170 days, maybe to make those, maybe like
[07:28.220 --> 07:31.980]  120, 150 days to throw out a small batch of those. You could send me some of those and they'll be
[07:31.980 --> 07:37.980]  cool. Um, the main part of the question, if I wanted to use some of your genetics as a base
[07:37.980 --> 07:45.100]  for a few of my seeds, um, do I have to seek your permission? You can use my seeds and my crosses as
[07:45.100 --> 07:52.140]  your base, but it would be cooler if you used one side of your cross as your base. Don't use the
[07:52.140 --> 07:56.940]  male and the female. Like if you're going to use a couple of my females and a different male,
[07:56.940 --> 08:02.620]  that's cool, but don't use just like my Arise and my Strawberry Starburst or my, uh, I don't know,
[08:02.620 --> 08:07.260]  don't do two of my things. Don't do Blueberry Butcher and Sunkiss because those are both mine.
[08:07.260 --> 08:11.820]  Uh, that would be cool, but that I could do that. That's kind of, that's like taking a Ferrari and
[08:11.820 --> 08:16.780]  another kind of Ferrari and just making Ferrari your version. Do some different sort of work to
[08:16.780 --> 08:21.580]  it to make it yours. I appreciate and respect that you love my work enough to want to put it into
[08:21.580 --> 08:26.940]  your breeding, but there's gotta be another breeder out there that inspires you or encourages you,
[08:26.940 --> 08:32.060]  and you could use their work to kind of mix with mine. If you really want to do, uh, both of mine
[08:32.060 --> 08:35.740]  just for your own personal seed collection, that's not a big deal. But if these seeds are going to go
[08:35.740 --> 08:40.620]  anywhere, I'd recommend that you use somebody else's line. Um, and it sounds like you're just
[08:40.620 --> 08:43.660]  trying to save your own stuff so you can do whatever you want with them. Yeah. Though,
[08:43.660 --> 08:49.100]  if you're going to market the idea, the etiquette would be to use two different breeders, make your
[08:49.100 --> 08:53.180]  own male, and then use that male for breeding and marketing your own stuff. But it sounds like you
[08:53.180 --> 08:57.980]  just want to make these for your own stash. Yes. In that case, bro, use mine to do whatever you
[08:57.980 --> 09:03.100]  want. Have a good old time and send me some of the F1s. Uh, maybe I'll work with those and send you
[09:03.100 --> 09:07.980]  something back or send me some of the F2s and same story. Maybe we'll do things you never know.
[09:07.980 --> 09:11.100]  Maybe I'll fall in love with what you've sent me and I'll want to breed to it also. And then
[09:11.100 --> 09:14.940]  you'll end up with some great seeds in return. There've been some great exchanges happening
[09:14.940 --> 09:19.420]  within the group here lately. So big shout out to everybody for being so generous lately also.
[09:20.380 --> 09:24.460]  But yes, you do have my permission. You don't need to specifically seek my permission to breed
[09:24.460 --> 09:29.260]  with my seeds, but since you asked about it, you've got my full permission and encouragement
[09:29.260 --> 09:34.300]  and endorsement to breed with my seeds. I didn't invent cannabis. I didn't invent seeds. I didn't
[09:34.380 --> 09:40.380]  invent nature. Uh, whatever you believe in, if it's a sun Roth, it's Jai Rastafari. If you believe
[09:40.380 --> 09:44.620]  in a zoom, if you believe in water bottle as your God, I'm cool with that. You could believe in
[09:44.620 --> 09:49.820]  whatever you want. I have no problem with that, but that's what created seeds. And that's, that's
[09:49.820 --> 09:54.060]  who we've got to be grateful for. So I'm breeding with some of their projects. We all are. I didn't
[09:54.060 --> 09:58.940]  pull seeds out of thin air. I didn't manifest them. Uh, they didn't pop out of my computer screen.
[09:58.940 --> 10:03.740]  I had to get seeds from somewhere and use somebody else's, either their seeds or clones to start my
[10:03.740 --> 10:09.820]  growing breeding seed project. Uh, so I give you my permission to do the same with my genetics too,
[10:09.820 --> 10:16.780]  because I would be arrogant and disrespectful of me to the entire industry community breeders
[10:16.780 --> 10:21.500]  before me and breeders after me to say, no, you can't use my stuff. That's a dickhead move.
[10:21.500 --> 10:27.100]  Uh, I have to treat it like, uh, I'm proud you respect my genetics and appreciate it enough.
[10:27.100 --> 10:31.260]  And I'm proud to have made something and honored that you want to continue my work.
[10:31.900 --> 10:35.980]  I've said it before. I'm not going to live forever. I don't want to, I don't, I'm not planning anything
[10:35.980 --> 10:40.220]  as I ain't got no fucking plans, but I know I won't live forever. I'm not going to do anything
[10:40.220 --> 10:44.380]  on purpose, but I could disappear. I could take in a wrong breath right now. And this could be
[10:44.380 --> 10:49.980]  the end of it like right now, or I could live another 20 or 30, maybe 40 years, maybe 40 or 50
[10:49.980 --> 10:52.860]  more years after that, it's going to get uncomfortable and we'll have to think about things.
[10:52.860 --> 10:59.340]  But, uh, once I'm gone, I want the people left to be working with my strains and I want to have
[10:59.420 --> 11:03.580]  taught them what I want to make everybody self-sufficient. And if my seeds are how you get
[11:03.580 --> 11:08.940]  there, my podcast, my seeds, my teachings, uh, that's I'm honored for that. Thank you. Uh, then
[11:08.940 --> 11:13.980]  I get to live forever. Um, yeah, think about Led Zeppelin. Led Zeppelin died years ago, right? Well,
[11:13.980 --> 11:17.420]  not everybody, but parts of Led Zeppelin, most of the Beatles are dead and their music lives on
[11:17.420 --> 11:22.060]  for ever. That stuff goes, Elvis is dead. That's a good example. Elvis is dead. And people are
[11:22.060 --> 11:26.140]  still listening to Elvis right now. Elvis lives on Elvis is still making more money than most of us.
[11:26.860 --> 11:31.340]  And the dude is dead. So, um, I hope that my brand lives on my little stickers,
[11:31.340 --> 11:34.460]  Rasta Jeff stickers and the website and all that shit. I hope that is,
[11:34.460 --> 11:40.380]  goes on long after me. Uh, luckily YouTube, uh, if it works right, I'll have YouTube won't ever
[11:40.380 --> 11:44.780]  delete the videos. All these videos will be up indefinitely unless somebody fucking flags my
[11:44.780 --> 11:47.980]  account or something when I'm dead. And then I don't give a shit. You guys could deal with it,
[11:47.980 --> 11:52.860]  but, um, yeah, I'm not going to be here forever. So I do encourage you, uh, to make some legacy
[11:52.860 --> 11:56.700]  seeds. You never know I'm breeding with a rest in peace. I'm breeding with my friend,
[11:56.700 --> 12:02.140]  sub cool stuff. Sub cool was kind of a mentor and a teacher and an inspiration and an idol to me.
[12:02.140 --> 12:06.700]  Sub cool paved the way without sub cool. I wouldn't be doing it. So recently, uh, with
[12:06.700 --> 12:10.780]  miss Jill's permission, I bred with the Jack, the ripper. I'm friends with miss Jill. Shout out,
[12:10.780 --> 12:14.540]  Jill. I hope you're listening. I hope you're well, maybe I'll see you in February at the
[12:14.540 --> 12:20.780]  Indo expo. You guys don't be weird. Um, so I did breed with Jack, the ripper with Jill's permission.
[12:20.780 --> 12:26.060]  Jill was a sub cools. Uh, what is it? A wife with one time? I don't know what you say. A widow.
[12:26.060 --> 12:30.300]  That's the word of the widow. So Jill was sub cools widow and she gave me permission to breed
[12:30.300 --> 12:36.140]  with his work and I did it to honor my buddy sub cool. So, um, yeah, I was subs gone and we're
[12:36.140 --> 12:39.900]  still working with his, his stuff, giving him a paying tribute to him, giving him love, giving
[12:39.900 --> 12:45.420]  him honor, keeping his name going. So since I've bred with stuff from sub cool, um, my stuff is
[12:45.420 --> 12:48.860]  out there going on and then people are going to breed to that. And then people are going to breed
[12:48.860 --> 12:53.100]  to that. And then my name will continue. Sub cools name will continue. We'll be around for
[12:53.100 --> 12:58.140]  generations in this cannabis game for a long, long time. So I do give you my permission. Got
[12:58.140 --> 13:01.660]  quite rambly on that one. It's thinking about my buddy sub cool. Shout out. So you miss you,
[13:01.660 --> 13:05.100]  brother. That dude taught me a lot. You guys, you have no idea. Uh, some of the message,
[13:05.100 --> 13:08.700]  cause sometimes sub would be like, are you a fucking idiot? And if you're like, maybe I am
[13:08.700 --> 13:12.780]  dude. Like what? And then he would point, pointed out that here kind of being a fucking idiot. He
[13:12.780 --> 13:15.980]  wouldn't be afraid to tell you. And then he'd message you back. Like, I'm sorry, brother. I
[13:15.980 --> 13:19.740]  was being an asshole. Like, no, you're right. It was being a fucking idiot. I totally was. I'm glad
[13:19.740 --> 13:23.580]  somebody had the balls to say it. So I'd be, thank you brother. And so that's, yeah, you miss
[13:23.580 --> 13:28.060]  that kind of shit when it's gone. Uh, there is a two part to this question. I got rambly thinking
[13:28.060 --> 13:34.700]  about subby big respects up. Um, you can't take her as fucker. Uh, hope the nice boy clock is over.
[13:34.700 --> 13:39.420]  Then it goes on. It says, do you have any kind of classic land race style genetics to use as a
[13:39.420 --> 13:46.060]  parent to really create my own library, which you would recommend? Uh, no, I don't mess with
[13:46.060 --> 13:53.340]  land races. That is, uh, that's a whole nother, uh, niche. What is it? Alley Avenue of breeding
[13:53.340 --> 13:57.980]  nerds. And I'm being completely respectful when I'm saying breeding nerds. When I talk about
[13:57.980 --> 14:02.460]  breeding, there are guys like myself who are passionate about breeding. I love cannabis. I
[14:02.460 --> 14:08.300]  love growing. I love teaching. I love breeding. I love, uh, selecting a male and pollinating females
[14:08.300 --> 14:12.460]  and watching how the females react. And then in the end I get to grow those seeds and watch the
[14:12.460 --> 14:17.980]  seeds and see like if I pollinated two different females with one male, I get to see what that boy
[14:17.980 --> 14:22.300]  added to the mix and how the female plants represent that male's pollen and how they
[14:22.300 --> 14:26.700]  express themselves in the progeny. And I'm completely passionate about growing cannabis
[14:26.700 --> 14:33.340]  and I'm completely passionate about breeding. But those land race nerds are a step above my
[14:33.340 --> 14:39.420]  passion and a step above my nerdiness. They, they know. So I know the genetics of what everything
[14:39.420 --> 14:44.140]  I'm working with is the grandparents, its parents, its recessive traits, its dominant traits, its
[14:44.140 --> 14:49.340]  flowering time, its turps, uh, how much it wants to be fed. I know so much about my plants, but
[14:49.340 --> 14:54.460]  these land race guys, they know from which geographical location it came from. They can
[14:54.460 --> 14:59.420]  tell you the coordinates on the globe. Like, well, that came from this here in like this part of
[14:59.500 --> 15:04.860]  Africa and this Valley found by this guy from this tribe. And I'm like, holy shit, man. I love it.
[15:04.860 --> 15:11.340]  It is beautiful. But that is another level of nerdom that I haven't delved into yet. And you,
[15:11.340 --> 15:15.100]  you, uh, land race nerds, I'm not being disrespectful by calling you land race seed
[15:15.100 --> 15:19.740]  nerds. You get what I'm saying? I'm a breeding nerd. I'm a weed nerd as well. The land race guys
[15:19.740 --> 15:24.540]  take it to another freaking level. It's like, there's a, there's musicians, right? I'm a rock
[15:24.540 --> 15:29.100]  and roll musician. I can read and write music, but that's not my thing. Let's get out there and just
[15:29.100 --> 15:32.700]  rock and roll, play some four, four, a classic rock and roll kind of shit. Then you got those
[15:32.700 --> 15:36.540]  guys that sit there with the music in front of them and they can read the charts and they've got
[15:36.540 --> 15:42.220]  seven other pieces around them all reading charts and nobody varies one note or one piece of tempo,
[15:42.220 --> 15:46.300]  one tempo shift at all today. Uh, that's what the land race nerds are like. They're like the,
[15:46.300 --> 15:50.620]  the extra level. And I love them. I got nothing but respect for you guys, but that is a whole
[15:50.620 --> 15:55.420]  nother level. Um, I don't even know who to recommend for land race genetics. I have a
[15:55.420 --> 15:59.980]  couple of friends that work with that stuff, but they're not really that the land race guys aren't
[15:59.980 --> 16:03.740]  out there to make a bunch of seeds for the world. They're just doing kind of like yourself. They're
[16:03.740 --> 16:08.700]  doing their own closet project because they really want to do some crazy breeding and find really
[16:08.700 --> 16:12.940]  unique shit. That land race breeding will be fun for you. That will, you'll find some great shit
[16:12.940 --> 16:16.860]  in there. You're going to find some wild variations, some really long flowering time,
[16:16.860 --> 16:21.100]  some unique turps, uh, maybe some unique cannabinoid profiles that we haven't seen,
[16:21.100 --> 16:25.100]  found, enjoyed in a long time. A lot of shit that's been washed away by commercial cannabis
[16:25.100 --> 16:30.860]  because of specific demands. So, um, maybe Google like, uh, go to all the recommended,
[16:30.860 --> 16:35.500]  go to my website. Here's a good, here's a good way to start. Go to my website, then go to all
[16:35.500 --> 16:40.700]  of the recommended breeders that are listed on my website. There are eight vendors on there.
[16:40.700 --> 16:45.980]  Seven of them probably have the opportunity to offer you land race genetics. The Canadian
[16:45.980 --> 16:50.380]  vendor only offers I read genetics. I know they're not going to have land races. It's only an I read
[16:50.380 --> 16:55.340]  genetics vendor in Canada. Hint, hint. You guys, there is a Canadian vendor on the website now,
[16:55.340 --> 16:59.820]  specifically for Canada. You don't have to pay those exorbitant Canadian shipping charges,
[17:00.700 --> 17:04.380]  but go to the website, check out the list of vendors. Click on those,
[17:04.380 --> 17:08.620]  uh, open up seven different tabs. You can just, uh, right click, open new tab,
[17:08.620 --> 17:12.620]  open up all the new tabs. You've got all the vendors open up on your, on your browser there,
[17:12.620 --> 17:16.700]  and then just start at number one and go to the search bar and type in land race genetics.
[17:16.700 --> 17:21.420]  See what pops up, see what you're looking for. Do you know what land races you're looking for?
[17:21.420 --> 17:27.500]  Do you want Brazilian, African, Mexican, uh, Thai, Afghani? There are a lot of great options. Do you
[17:27.500 --> 17:33.100]  know what you want? Do you know what you want to cross together? Do you know what some of those
[17:33.100 --> 17:38.140]  common crosses have already been bred to make? A lot of the old school, super popular crosses,
[17:38.140 --> 17:43.340]  uh, will be like a Brazilian, Thai, Afghani cross or something similar to that. And they
[17:43.340 --> 17:49.020]  weren't labeled all super crazy. It wasn't bubble gum to magic pony ride to magic mustache to
[17:49.020 --> 17:53.340]  fucking fruity pebbles. It wasn't any of that. It was tied to Afghani is what they used to be
[17:53.340 --> 17:57.900]  called. And they'd cross the tie to Afghani to a Mexican and then cross that to something else.
[17:57.900 --> 18:02.380]  And that's what they called it. Thai, Afghan, Mexican, and you have a Tam or a Thai, Afghan,
[18:02.380 --> 18:07.100]  Brazilian, and you'd have a tab, but, uh, that's how it used to be. So, uh, I would recommend you
[18:07.100 --> 18:11.900]  go search the websites and then just type in land race genetics. And if nothing from the recommended
[18:11.980 --> 18:17.980]  breeders on my website gets you any luck, then go to Google and start searching or go to my discord,
[18:17.980 --> 18:21.980]  go to the discord. There are a lot of great nerds there. Join the general chat, join the
[18:21.980 --> 18:26.460]  IRI genetics chat, and just type in, Hey, who here messes with land race genetics? Maybe one
[18:26.460 --> 18:31.180]  of my friends has got some for you. Maybe we can find you a seed bank. That's got them. But, uh,
[18:31.180 --> 18:35.100]  the reason I'm saying, not saying right away, go to Google is because I think we can find you
[18:35.100 --> 18:40.380]  a trusted resources by operating through my website, my channels, my website, all those
[18:40.380 --> 18:45.980]  vendors are accredited. Uh, they've been vetted. They're tried and true. I know they're reliable.
[18:45.980 --> 18:49.740]  Everybody on discord, they're cool as shit. And if not, they get kicked out of the discord. We
[18:49.740 --> 18:54.140]  don't let any dipshits assholes or with a small exception, then sometimes there's some dipshits
[18:54.140 --> 18:58.060]  assholes in there, but they've got redeeming qualities. They're only like three to 7%
[18:58.060 --> 19:01.580]  dipshit or asshole. So we let them hang out there. Maybe they're funny or something.
[19:01.580 --> 19:06.060]  Uh, but join us on discord. Maybe you've got the opportunity to get some land race seeds.
[19:06.060 --> 19:10.700]  Whatever I smoke today has got me fucking stone and rambly and I'm enjoying it. I really think
[19:10.700 --> 19:15.340]  it was called Bohemian Grove from green dot labs. They don't pay me at all to talk about that shit,
[19:15.340 --> 19:20.460]  but that's what I hit and it got me going. Shout out to green dot labs. All right. So I think I
[19:20.460 --> 19:26.460]  answered this question in great, great detail. Uh, I wish I had more recommendations for the
[19:26.460 --> 19:32.140]  land races for you, but that is not my thing. Do enjoy your journey into land race genetics.
[19:32.140 --> 19:36.300]  That will be a good time for you. Let's see. All right. Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls,
[19:36.300 --> 19:41.260]  pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers, clone cutters, Paul and chuckers, all of you
