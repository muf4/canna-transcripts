[00:17.600 --> 00:20.040]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[00:20.040 --> 00:22.040]  It's time for episode number 101
[00:22.040 --> 00:23.840]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:23.840 --> 00:27.760]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.760 --> 00:28.800]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:28.800 --> 00:30.000]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:30.000 --> 00:32.160]  if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber,
[00:32.160 --> 00:33.600]  if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:33.600 --> 00:35.120]  or even someone who is just curious
[00:35.120 --> 00:36.480]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:36.480 --> 00:39.240]  this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:39.240 --> 00:40.880]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:40.880 --> 00:42.480]  I wanna thank you guys for joining me.
[00:42.480 --> 00:44.480]  I'm coming to you on a beautiful Friday afternoon.
[00:44.480 --> 00:45.480]  It is a gorgeous Friday.
[00:45.480 --> 00:47.480]  I hope everybody's having a wonderful day.
[00:47.480 --> 00:48.320]  No matter what you're doing,
[00:48.320 --> 00:49.520]  I hope you're smoking something delicious.
[00:49.520 --> 00:50.760]  I hope you're taking a fat dab.
[00:50.760 --> 00:51.760]  I hope you're eating some edibles.
[00:51.760 --> 00:53.040]  I hope you got a fat joint rolled up.
[00:53.040 --> 00:54.520]  I hope you got a tasty bowl packed.
[00:54.520 --> 00:56.040]  I hope you got a vape loaded.
[00:56.040 --> 00:56.880]  However you do it,
[00:56.880 --> 00:58.920]  I hope you are consuming some cannabis with me.
[00:58.920 --> 01:00.080]  You guys, it is Friday.
[01:00.080 --> 01:01.720]  It's just after 4.20.
[01:01.720 --> 01:02.880]  I'm slightly dabbed out.
[01:02.880 --> 01:04.600]  It's been a beautiful day.
[01:04.600 --> 01:05.760]  Last night was an amazing night.
[01:05.760 --> 01:08.160]  I got to see the legendary reggae band,
[01:08.160 --> 01:12.400]  Israel Vibration in Denver at the Ogden Theater.
[01:12.400 --> 01:13.380]  I've talked about it before.
[01:13.380 --> 01:15.080]  The Roots Radix was there.
[01:15.080 --> 01:16.200]  The Roots Radix is of course,
[01:16.200 --> 01:18.760]  the backing band for Israel Vibration.
[01:18.760 --> 01:19.680]  They were solid.
[01:19.680 --> 01:22.160]  Israel Vibration was solid and on fire.
[01:22.160 --> 01:24.200]  Unfortunately, I feel like it's probably
[01:24.200 --> 01:26.120]  getting close to the end for that band.
[01:26.120 --> 01:28.080]  This might be one of their final tours.
[01:29.040 --> 01:30.680]  Just a little rant about Israel Vibration.
[01:30.680 --> 01:32.640]  Israel Vibration is a Jamaican reggae band
[01:32.640 --> 01:37.040]  that actually met in an orphanage for children with polio.
[01:37.040 --> 01:38.960]  So there were three members of Israel Vibration.
[01:38.960 --> 01:40.240]  All three of them had polio.
[01:40.240 --> 01:42.440]  Several years ago, one member left the band
[01:42.440 --> 01:44.340]  and now there are only two dudes left.
[01:44.780 --> 01:47.020]  It is my opinion that one dude
[01:47.020 --> 01:48.380]  looks like he is done touring.
[01:48.380 --> 01:49.820]  The look on his face during the show
[01:49.820 --> 01:51.820]  just looks like he's struggling.
[01:51.820 --> 01:53.020]  The polio is getting to him.
[01:53.020 --> 01:53.860]  It's kicking his ass.
[01:53.860 --> 01:55.260]  The other guy looks like he's doing pretty good.
[01:55.260 --> 01:56.860]  He gets around quite well.
[01:56.860 --> 01:58.860]  The one guy looks like he may,
[01:58.860 --> 02:00.060]  I don't think he wants to tour anymore.
[02:00.060 --> 02:01.860]  It looks like the other dude's dragging him out on tour.
[02:01.860 --> 02:04.420]  He's like, you can't be Israel Vibration without both of us,
[02:04.420 --> 02:05.860]  so I need you to come with them.
[02:05.860 --> 02:06.900]  That's kind of what it looks like to me.
[02:06.900 --> 02:09.700]  So I may actually catch Israel Vibration again tonight.
[02:09.700 --> 02:11.060]  Just kind of depends on how things go.
[02:11.060 --> 02:12.660]  After recording here, I'm going to see what time it is
[02:12.700 --> 02:14.380]  and see if I got anybody that wants to go with me.
[02:14.380 --> 02:16.380]  We may go see some reggae tonight.
[02:16.380 --> 02:18.620]  Anyway, shout out to Israel Vibration.
[02:18.620 --> 02:20.060]  Big shout out to the Roots Radix Band.
[02:20.060 --> 02:21.940]  I feel like I caught one of the final tours
[02:21.940 --> 02:22.820]  that these guys are going to do,
[02:22.820 --> 02:24.540]  so I'm really excited about that.
[02:24.540 --> 02:26.320]  Of course, they did one of my favorite songs.
[02:26.320 --> 02:28.260]  They did Herb is the Healing.
[02:28.260 --> 02:30.860]  The encore, they did Red Eyes.
[02:30.860 --> 02:33.320]  Big shout out to the Ogden Theater for not kicking me out,
[02:33.320 --> 02:34.900]  for smoking a whole bunch of weed in there.
[02:34.900 --> 02:36.100]  That was pretty cool.
[02:36.100 --> 02:37.820]  I got one security guard gave me the look of,
[02:37.820 --> 02:38.940]  hey, chill out on the smoking,
[02:38.940 --> 02:40.460]  and that was pretty much all they did.
[02:40.460 --> 02:41.300]  They didn't care.
[02:41.300 --> 02:42.120]  They didn't take my shit from me.
[02:42.480 --> 02:43.840]  They didn't kick me out, so much respect,
[02:43.840 --> 02:46.960]  much love to the Ogden Theater and Israel Vibration.
[02:47.840 --> 02:48.960]  You guys, before I get too far,
[02:48.960 --> 02:51.120]  let's do some shout outs and give some thanks.
[02:51.120 --> 02:52.200]  Of course, I need to give thanks
[02:52.200 --> 02:54.400]  and a big shout out to the Mystic Roots Band.
[02:54.400 --> 02:55.880]  Big shout out to the Mystic Roots Crew.
[02:55.880 --> 02:57.560]  Big shout out to Kat, Coot,
[02:57.560 --> 02:59.800]  everybody involved in the Mystic Roots Crew,
[02:59.800 --> 03:02.080]  the Stay Positive Productions, all of those kids,
[03:02.080 --> 03:03.440]  everybody I got mad love for you.
[03:03.440 --> 03:04.820]  I got much respect for you.
[03:04.820 --> 03:06.680]  Make sure you guys check out the Mystic Roots Band.
[03:06.680 --> 03:09.000]  They let me play their music on the podcast.
[03:09.000 --> 03:10.680]  They don't ask for anything in return.
[03:10.680 --> 03:12.100]  I give them a shout out because they're my friends,
[03:13.080 --> 03:13.920]  and I support them.
[03:13.920 --> 03:14.740]  They support positivity.
[03:14.740 --> 03:15.660]  They support reggae music.
[03:15.660 --> 03:17.100]  Support that shit.
[03:17.100 --> 03:19.220]  In my opinion, Catherine Ramirez
[03:19.220 --> 03:20.980]  is the most beautiful woman in reggae,
[03:20.980 --> 03:23.500]  so make sure you check out the Mystic Roots Band.
[03:23.500 --> 03:24.700]  Check out Miss Catherine Ramirez.
[03:24.700 --> 03:25.540]  Check out Coot Dog.
[03:25.540 --> 03:26.520]  Check out what they're doing.
[03:26.520 --> 03:27.980]  Good positive shit.
[03:27.980 --> 03:29.680]  Also, let's give some shout outs
[03:29.680 --> 03:32.260]  to everybody that showed up for episode number 100.
[03:32.260 --> 03:33.900]  I wanna give them a personal thank you.
[03:33.900 --> 03:35.140]  We had a hell of a good time.
[03:35.140 --> 03:36.900]  We may have got a little bit too high.
[03:36.900 --> 03:39.340]  I apologize if the show got off the rails a couple of times.
[03:39.340 --> 03:41.000]  That's just how it goes when everybody's here
[03:41.000 --> 03:43.360]  and we eat that many edibles and take that many dabs.
[03:43.360 --> 03:45.640]  But I do wanna send a huge sincere thank you shout out
[03:45.640 --> 03:46.920]  to Spence and Maddie.
[03:46.920 --> 03:49.960]  Also, Sloppy and Joe, and also a huge shout out to Mike.
[03:49.960 --> 03:51.200]  Everybody took time out of their day
[03:51.200 --> 03:52.400]  to come here and be on a podcast.
[03:52.400 --> 03:53.240]  I appreciate it.
[03:53.240 --> 03:55.280]  That was super cool of them.
[03:55.280 --> 03:56.560]  Also, I wanna give a huge shout out
[03:56.560 --> 03:58.280]  to a couple of brands and sponsors
[03:58.280 --> 03:59.880]  that I missed on episode 100.
[03:59.880 --> 04:01.700]  I was focused on having a good time.
[04:01.700 --> 04:03.520]  We did that, but I skipped one part.
[04:03.520 --> 04:04.560]  I needed to give a shout out
[04:04.560 --> 04:06.760]  to my good friends at Oil Slick.
[04:06.760 --> 04:08.480]  Shout out to everybody at Oil Slick.
[04:08.480 --> 04:09.520]  Those guys are cool as shit.
[04:09.520 --> 04:11.280]  Make sure you support Oil Slick.
[04:11.280 --> 04:13.000]  Also, shout out to a good friend,
[04:13.000 --> 04:16.320]  Task Rock and Highly Educated Titanium.
[04:16.320 --> 04:18.280]  Task used to sponsor the show.
[04:18.280 --> 04:19.960]  Oil Slick used to sponsor the show.
[04:19.960 --> 04:20.800]  They're all still family.
[04:20.800 --> 04:21.640]  Shout out to those guys.
[04:21.640 --> 04:24.840]  Also, a big shout out to Dougie and the Hitman Glass crew.
[04:24.840 --> 04:26.640]  I wouldn't be dabbing the way I dab
[04:26.640 --> 04:30.400]  without Oil Slick, Highly Educated, and Hitman Glass.
[04:30.400 --> 04:32.080]  That's what keeps me dabbing the way that I do.
[04:32.080 --> 04:34.400]  And of course, big shout out to the Garden of Weeden.
[04:34.400 --> 04:36.480]  The Garden of Weeden keeps me well-medicated.
[04:36.480 --> 04:37.580]  I like it.
[04:37.580 --> 04:39.400]  All right, so we got most of the shout outs covered.
[04:40.240 --> 04:41.080]  Let's see, who else do I need to shout out?
[04:41.080 --> 04:42.320]  You know who I need to give the biggest,
[04:42.320 --> 04:44.360]  hugest thank you and shout out to?
[04:44.360 --> 04:45.760]  All of my listeners.
[04:45.760 --> 04:47.360]  Everybody that listens to this podcast,
[04:47.360 --> 04:49.200]  everybody that supports this show.
[04:49.200 --> 04:51.480]  This podcast wouldn't happen without you guys.
[04:51.480 --> 04:52.400]  Well, I do it partly for me,
[04:52.400 --> 04:53.280]  because I feel like I have to.
[04:53.280 --> 04:54.500]  It just comes out of me naturally.
[04:54.500 --> 04:56.800]  I would go crazy if I didn't do the podcast nowadays.
[04:56.800 --> 04:57.800]  But I do it for you guys.
[04:57.800 --> 04:58.880]  This podcast is for you.
[04:58.880 --> 05:00.480]  This is my gift to you.
[05:00.480 --> 05:01.980]  I've been blessed with the ability
[05:01.980 --> 05:03.420]  to learn a whole bunch about cannabis.
[05:03.420 --> 05:06.240]  I've been blessed to be around people that love cannabis.
[05:06.240 --> 05:09.360]  I feel like I'm very privileged to be in this position.
[05:10.200 --> 05:11.120]  In this industry, in this state,
[05:11.120 --> 05:12.960]  in this time and age where I am.
[05:12.960 --> 05:14.240]  I feel like I'm really blessed.
[05:14.240 --> 05:15.120]  I'm lucky.
[05:15.120 --> 05:15.960]  It's a gift.
[05:15.960 --> 05:17.780]  So I feel like I need to share it with you.
[05:17.780 --> 05:18.720]  So this is for you.
[05:18.720 --> 05:20.300]  I want to thank all of you people
[05:20.300 --> 05:21.340]  for listening to the show.
[05:21.340 --> 05:22.920]  Everyone that subscribes.
[05:22.920 --> 05:25.360]  Everybody that interacts with me on social media.
[05:25.360 --> 05:26.200]  Thank you guys.
[05:26.200 --> 05:27.400]  Thank each and every one of you.
[05:27.400 --> 05:29.240]  Personally, I'm giving all of you a fist bump.
[05:29.240 --> 05:31.960]  This is to the microphone, fist bump right here.
[05:31.960 --> 05:32.800]  You heard that?
[05:32.800 --> 05:33.680]  That was a fist bump on the mic.
[05:33.680 --> 05:34.680]  That's for each and every one of you.
[05:34.680 --> 05:37.680]  Much respect, much love to everybody who supports the show.
[05:37.680 --> 05:39.860]  Also, an extra special shout out
[05:39.860 --> 05:42.380]  to everybody who watches me on Periscope.
[05:42.380 --> 05:44.320]  You guys, I've got a nice little following on Periscope.
[05:44.320 --> 05:46.960]  It's great jumping on and seeing all my crew on there.
[05:46.960 --> 05:48.720]  Thank you to everybody that jumps on.
[05:48.720 --> 05:50.800]  I love it, I love it, I love it.
[05:50.800 --> 05:51.640]  All right, you guys.
[05:51.640 --> 05:52.920]  I think that's enough shout outs.
[05:52.920 --> 05:55.160]  I think that's enough ass kissing for one episode.
[05:55.160 --> 05:57.480]  Let's get into some business here.
[05:57.480 --> 05:58.600]  On the last episode,
[05:58.600 --> 06:02.000]  we talked about some more issues with pesticides
[06:02.000 --> 06:02.840]  at a dispensary.
[06:02.840 --> 06:05.380]  So I'm pulling up the article right now.
[06:05.380 --> 06:07.560]  This article comes from The Cannabist.
[06:08.440 --> 06:10.360]  This one, of course, is written by David McCoya,
[06:10.360 --> 06:12.720]  sorry, David McGoya and Ricardo Baca.
[06:12.720 --> 06:14.960]  I tried to make that all into one name there.
[06:14.960 --> 06:17.200]  From the Denver Post and of course The Cannabist.
[06:17.200 --> 06:18.240]  The headline says,
[06:18.240 --> 06:20.360]  Nature's Cure of Denver recalls pot products
[06:20.360 --> 06:21.800]  containing pesticides.
[06:21.800 --> 06:23.360]  Now let's get right into the article.
[06:23.360 --> 06:25.520]  It says, a second marijuana business in Denver
[06:25.520 --> 06:28.340]  in just over a week has voluntarily recalled its products
[06:28.340 --> 06:30.080]  because they contain a pesticide
[06:30.080 --> 06:32.960]  not allowed for use on cannabis.
[06:32.960 --> 06:34.520]  Denver health officials announced the recall
[06:34.520 --> 06:35.760]  by Nature's Cure,
[06:35.760 --> 06:37.840]  which also is known as Colfax Pot Shop,
[06:37.840 --> 06:40.360]  Wednesday after tests found high levels of a pesticide
[06:40.360 --> 06:43.940]  that cannot be legally used to grow the crop.
[06:43.940 --> 06:46.480]  The recall extends to all of the company's plant material
[06:46.480 --> 06:49.680]  as well as its concentrates purchased before October 6th,
[06:49.680 --> 06:52.720]  according to the Denver Department of Environmental Health.
[06:52.720 --> 06:57.040]  The business has one retail location at 1500 East Colfax.
[06:57.040 --> 06:59.320]  The pesticides Spiromefacin was detected
[06:59.320 --> 07:01.280]  during follow-up tests at Colfax Pot Shop
[07:01.280 --> 07:03.760]  after inspectors found pesticides in cannabis
[07:03.760 --> 07:06.200]  the shop had grown and sent to a facility for processing
[07:06.200 --> 07:10.060]  into various forms of marijuana infused products.
[07:11.040 --> 07:13.320]  That facility, Mahatma, has also been the source
[07:13.320 --> 07:15.920]  of its own recall over pesticide concerns.
[07:15.920 --> 07:17.840]  An employee who answered the phone at Nature's Cure
[07:17.840 --> 07:20.140]  said its owners did not have a comment.
[07:20.140 --> 07:22.500]  The recalled products include dried medical marijuana
[07:22.500 --> 07:27.500]  with cultivation facility number 403-00651 on the label,
[07:28.120 --> 07:33.120]  dried recreational marijuana with the number 403R-00035
[07:33.440 --> 07:37.600]  on the label, and concentrates from The Lab, Craft 710,
[07:37.600 --> 07:42.240]  TC Labs, Lab 710, or Mahatma showing either number
[07:42.240 --> 07:43.760]  on their label.
[07:43.760 --> 07:46.720]  So you guys, if you have dried marijuana,
[07:46.720 --> 07:49.440]  if you bought cannabis, that's pot, flowers, you guys,
[07:49.440 --> 07:53.120]  if you bought dried marijuana and the cultivation facility
[07:53.120 --> 07:58.120]  number on the label is 403-00651, take it back.
[07:59.360 --> 08:02.060]  If you bought dried recreational marijuana
[08:02.100 --> 08:07.100]  with the number 403R-00035 on the label,
[08:07.700 --> 08:09.820]  take that shit back.
[08:09.820 --> 08:14.820]  And concentrates from The Lab, Craft 710, TC Labs,
[08:14.860 --> 08:18.900]  Lab 710, or Mahatma showing either one of those numbers
[08:18.900 --> 08:21.220]  on their labels, you guys, take those products back
[08:21.220 --> 08:24.140]  to where you purchased them and either ask for an exchange
[08:24.140 --> 08:26.100]  for something without pesticides in it
[08:26.100 --> 08:27.580]  or get your damn money back.
[08:27.580 --> 08:30.060]  I do not know the return policy on any dispensary.
[08:30.060 --> 08:31.780]  They may not give you back your money.
[08:32.500 --> 08:33.820]  They may give you a store credit for a product,
[08:33.820 --> 08:35.500]  but whatever you do, go exchange it.
[08:35.500 --> 08:38.300]  You do not want to smoke this pesticide.
[08:38.300 --> 08:40.460]  All right, consumers are urged to destroy the product
[08:40.460 --> 08:42.000]  or return it to the place of purchase
[08:42.000 --> 08:43.480]  is what the article says.
[08:43.480 --> 08:45.780]  It is the second business this month to issue a recall
[08:45.780 --> 08:48.140]  of its marijuana over concerns that potentially dangerous
[08:48.140 --> 08:50.660]  pesticides were used to cultivate the plants.
[08:50.660 --> 08:53.700]  The other, True Cannabis, issued a recall on October 13th
[08:53.700 --> 08:56.220]  after tests determined three disallowed pesticides
[08:56.220 --> 08:58.580]  were used to grow plants that were later processed
[08:58.580 --> 09:02.420]  into marijuana infused products or MIPs.
[09:02.420 --> 09:05.020]  As with Colfax Pot Shop, plants grown by True Cannabis
[09:05.020 --> 09:06.940]  and sent to Mahatma for processing were found
[09:06.940 --> 09:09.380]  to contain the pesticides, health officials said.
[09:09.380 --> 09:11.300]  There have been no reports of illness associated
[09:11.300 --> 09:13.180]  with any of these recalls.
[09:13.180 --> 09:16.020]  You guys, in my opinion, it's gonna take a long time
[09:16.020 --> 09:18.020]  for health effects to be noticeable
[09:18.020 --> 09:20.340]  from smoking a pesticide like this.
[09:20.340 --> 09:22.420]  I'm not a doctor, I'm not a scientist,
[09:22.420 --> 09:25.140]  but these are the kinds of things that you smoke them today
[09:25.140 --> 09:28.000]  and you don't notice it until you're 20 years down the road
[09:28.520 --> 09:30.040]  and you've got some fucked up tumor in your lung,
[09:30.040 --> 09:31.760]  you've got some weird cancer,
[09:31.760 --> 09:33.360]  you've got something in your mouth that grew
[09:33.360 --> 09:35.560]  from this pesticide that you smoked.
[09:35.560 --> 09:37.760]  Some of these things will not affect you.
[09:37.760 --> 09:39.520]  Some of these things will go into your body
[09:39.520 --> 09:41.840]  and affect your body in really crazy ways
[09:41.840 --> 09:45.480]  and they will affect future generations of your family.
[09:45.480 --> 09:48.880]  So be aware of what you're consuming, you guys.
[09:48.880 --> 09:51.280]  And I don't think that people are going to start reporting
[09:51.280 --> 09:53.160]  these illnesses for a very long time.
[09:53.160 --> 09:54.480]  Maybe somebody did smoke something
[09:54.480 --> 09:55.880]  with a little too much pesticide on it
[09:55.880 --> 09:58.400]  and they got sick right away, but that's very uncommon.
[09:58.400 --> 10:00.760]  These plants have been through the drying and curing phase,
[10:00.760 --> 10:02.200]  they've been trimmed.
[10:02.200 --> 10:04.720]  You can't see, smell, or feel this shit on there.
[10:04.720 --> 10:06.800]  It's gotta be lab tested to find it.
[10:06.800 --> 10:08.120]  I'll continue with the article.
[10:08.120 --> 10:10.880]  MIPS often contain much higher concentrations of pesticides
[10:10.880 --> 10:12.560]  than dried plants processed for smoking
[10:12.560 --> 10:14.780]  because of the method used to extract THC
[10:14.780 --> 10:16.720]  and other cannabinoids from the plant.
[10:16.720 --> 10:20.100]  Also, pesticide levels dissipate quickly in dried marijuana,
[10:20.100 --> 10:23.080]  while amounts found in MIPS typically do not.
[10:23.080 --> 10:24.880]  And you guys, that is extremely accurate.
[10:24.880 --> 10:27.440]  When you make hash, if you take a bud,
[10:27.440 --> 10:29.880]  a plant that has been sprayed with pesticides,
[10:29.880 --> 10:31.460]  and you make hash with it,
[10:31.460 --> 10:34.120]  sometimes we can see the pesticide
[10:34.120 --> 10:35.560]  floating on the top of the hash.
[10:35.560 --> 10:37.320]  We can see a little sheen sometimes,
[10:37.320 --> 10:39.120]  we can see this little greasy layer.
[10:39.120 --> 10:41.280]  Sometimes we'll make a batch of hash and let it finish,
[10:41.280 --> 10:42.720]  and then you can touch the top of it
[10:42.720 --> 10:44.760]  and you can feel on your fingers
[10:44.760 --> 10:49.240]  a little oily layer of neem oil or stylet oil,
[10:49.240 --> 10:50.440]  or whatever type of oily product
[10:50.440 --> 10:53.000]  was applied to the plant, botanical oils.
[10:53.000 --> 10:55.560]  Sometimes you can see that floating on top of the hash.
[10:55.560 --> 10:57.920]  And it's hard to get out of there, you guys.
[10:57.920 --> 10:59.440]  It's gonna make your hash taste like that,
[10:59.440 --> 11:01.360]  you're gonna be consuming it.
[11:01.360 --> 11:03.040]  Stop spraying your plants with bullshit.
[11:03.040 --> 11:04.600]  That's, I think, the point here.
[11:04.600 --> 11:05.940]  Anyway, I will continue with the article
[11:05.940 --> 11:08.680]  because I feel like I've gotten myself off track.
[11:09.520 --> 11:10.840]  The recall is the fourth announced
[11:10.840 --> 11:12.760]  by the Denver Department of Environmental Health
[11:12.760 --> 11:15.280]  since it began cracking down on pesticides last spring,
[11:15.280 --> 11:17.960]  quarantining 100,000 plants.
[11:17.960 --> 11:19.700]  The worries about pesticides and marijuana
[11:19.700 --> 11:22.500]  are the result of federal laws that deem the drug illegal,
[11:22.540 --> 11:24.980]  and as a result, safety tests have not been done
[11:24.980 --> 11:29.140]  on the chemicals when specifically ingested on marijuana.
[11:29.140 --> 11:31.820]  Marijuana can be classed as either food or a drug
[11:31.820 --> 11:34.180]  because of various ways it can be consumed.
[11:34.180 --> 11:36.220]  Federal law deems it a drug.
[11:36.220 --> 11:38.500]  State agriculture officials have proposed a rule
[11:38.500 --> 11:40.160]  that would limit the number of pesticides
[11:40.160 --> 11:41.980]  allowed for use in growing marijuana
[11:41.980 --> 11:44.740]  to about 75 of the least harmful.
[11:44.740 --> 11:46.960]  The rule would allow manufacturers of pesticides
[11:46.960 --> 11:49.520]  among the improved products to petition the government
[11:49.520 --> 11:52.300]  to let marijuana growers use its chemical.
[11:52.980 --> 11:54.580]  The company would have to first approve the pesticide
[11:54.580 --> 11:57.160]  as safe to humans and the environment.
[11:57.160 --> 11:59.660]  Currently, growers can use more than 200 pesticides
[11:59.660 --> 12:02.000]  the state says has warning labels so broad
[12:02.000 --> 12:03.540]  that using the product on cannabis
[12:03.540 --> 12:05.220]  would not violate federal laws
[12:05.220 --> 12:08.840]  that require chemicals to be used only as directed.
[12:08.840 --> 12:10.500]  You guys, when you open up any pesticide,
[12:10.500 --> 12:11.940]  there's that little, or when you buy the bottle,
[12:11.940 --> 12:14.020]  there's that little booklet attached to the back.
[12:14.020 --> 12:16.300]  All you have to do is pop that open and it unfolds,
[12:16.300 --> 12:18.860]  and there are a bunch of rules and regulations in there.
[12:18.860 --> 12:21.020]  It tells you how you can apply that pesticide.
[12:21.020 --> 12:22.340]  It says what it can be used for.
[12:22.340 --> 12:24.860]  It says what type of crops it can be used on.
[12:24.860 --> 12:28.780]  It has got a window of reentry listed on there.
[12:28.780 --> 12:30.380]  It will say if you spray this product,
[12:30.380 --> 12:33.180]  do not reenter this room for up to four hours,
[12:33.180 --> 12:35.380]  or if you do enter the room, be in proper equipment.
[12:35.380 --> 12:38.260]  Use a ventilator, use some type of covering.
[12:38.260 --> 12:39.980]  There will be a lot of things written on there.
[12:39.980 --> 12:42.300]  If you do not use that pesticide
[12:42.300 --> 12:45.480]  the way that that direction label says to use it,
[12:45.480 --> 12:48.100]  you are in violation of federal law.
[12:48.100 --> 12:51.020]  If a farmer in an agricultural business
[12:51.020 --> 12:53.260]  is caught using those pesticides improperly,
[12:53.260 --> 12:54.220]  he will be fined.
[12:54.220 --> 12:56.020]  He will face a federal law.
[12:56.020 --> 12:58.540]  His farm will face penalties.
[12:58.540 --> 12:59.900]  This is serious stuff.
[12:59.900 --> 13:01.480]  I did not realize how important this was
[13:01.480 --> 13:03.880]  and how serious this was until I had a little bit of training
[13:03.880 --> 13:06.840]  from the Colorado Department of Agriculture.
[13:06.840 --> 13:08.580]  So you guys, pay attention to those warnings.
[13:08.580 --> 13:09.600]  It is serious shit.
[13:09.600 --> 13:12.420]  You may not notice how much risk you are putting yourself in
[13:12.420 --> 13:14.100]  when you're using these pesticides.
[13:14.100 --> 13:15.620]  I recommend that you go and read
[13:15.620 --> 13:17.180]  about each pesticide that you're using.
[13:17.180 --> 13:18.620]  Read about each ingredient in there.
[13:18.620 --> 13:20.300]  Find out what it's derived from.
[13:20.300 --> 13:21.580]  Find out what it's going to do to you
[13:21.580 --> 13:23.140]  in small concentrations.
[13:23.140 --> 13:24.500]  Find out what it's going to do to you
[13:24.500 --> 13:25.740]  in large concentrations.
[13:25.740 --> 13:28.220]  Find out what you're exposing yourself to.
[13:28.220 --> 13:30.780]  Read about what you're putting on your medicine.
[13:30.780 --> 13:32.220]  You're spraying people's,
[13:32.220 --> 13:33.860]  it may be recreational marijuana,
[13:33.860 --> 13:35.140]  it may be medical marijuana.
[13:35.140 --> 13:37.200]  Either way, find out what you're spraying
[13:37.200 --> 13:38.220]  on the stuff that you're giving
[13:38.220 --> 13:39.780]  to the people that you care about.
[13:39.780 --> 13:41.320]  If you're taking money for a product,
[13:41.320 --> 13:43.640]  if you're giving this product as a medical treatment,
[13:43.640 --> 13:44.900]  you need to take pride in it.
[13:44.900 --> 13:46.500]  It is your responsibility to make sure
[13:46.500 --> 13:48.620]  that no bullshit goes into your customers
[13:48.620 --> 13:50.220]  or your patients, your clients,
[13:50.220 --> 13:51.500]  whatever you want to call them.
[13:51.500 --> 13:53.980]  Their lungs and bodies should be treated like a temple
[13:53.980 --> 13:55.260]  and it's your responsibility
[13:55.260 --> 13:57.420]  that their cannabis is clean and safe.
[13:57.420 --> 13:59.140]  So that's your job as a grower.
[13:59.140 --> 14:00.820]  So read about all the pesticides.
[14:00.820 --> 14:02.760]  I'm going to continue and read the last line
[14:02.760 --> 14:03.600]  of the article.
[14:03.600 --> 14:05.100]  It says, despite the allowance,
[14:05.100 --> 14:06.980]  state officials have said they do not endorse
[14:06.980 --> 14:08.620]  the use of pesticides on marijuana
[14:08.620 --> 14:12.460]  because there is no data to ensure consumers are safe.
[14:13.620 --> 14:15.340]  It would be nice if we did not have to use
[14:15.340 --> 14:17.660]  any pesticides at all on growing cannabis,
[14:17.660 --> 14:20.380]  but it is very unrealistic.
[14:20.380 --> 14:21.660]  There are pests everywhere.
[14:21.660 --> 14:23.480]  We're building a new facility.
[14:23.480 --> 14:26.000]  Our grow facility is, it's basically the desert.
[14:26.000 --> 14:26.940]  It's a rocky desert.
[14:26.940 --> 14:28.620]  It is in Pueblo West, Colorado.
[14:30.260 --> 14:33.000]  Outside of the facility, there are lizards,
[14:33.000 --> 14:34.700]  there are snakes, there are tarantulas,
[14:34.700 --> 14:37.940]  there are spiders, there are centipedes.
[14:37.940 --> 14:40.700]  And we have built this facility from the ground up.
[14:40.700 --> 14:43.300]  It's a sealed facility and still occasionally,
[14:43.300 --> 14:46.540]  I will have to escort a baby tarantula out of the building
[14:46.540 --> 14:49.180]  or chase down a lizard out of the building.
[14:49.180 --> 14:51.440]  It's hard to keep shit out of buildings.
[14:51.440 --> 14:53.780]  Insects are much smaller than these tarantula,
[14:53.780 --> 14:57.820]  the pot pests are much smaller than tarantulas and lizards.
[14:57.820 --> 15:00.180]  So keeping them out of there will sometimes require
[15:00.180 --> 15:01.260]  some sort of a pesticide.
[15:01.260 --> 15:02.420]  Of course, we're going to finish the building
[15:02.420 --> 15:04.060]  and make, we'll seal it up a little bit better.
[15:04.060 --> 15:06.260]  But I mean, it's hard to keep shit out is my point.
[15:06.260 --> 15:07.820]  So we need some type of pesticide.
[15:07.820 --> 15:09.580]  We need some type of prevention.
[15:09.580 --> 15:12.340]  We need some type of integrated pest management system
[15:12.340 --> 15:13.820]  that will keep the bugs away.
[15:13.820 --> 15:15.420]  And a lot of times that requires
[15:15.420 --> 15:17.400]  some sort of a bottled pesticide.
[15:17.400 --> 15:19.340]  If you're going to use it, you guys be responsible.
[15:19.340 --> 15:20.620]  Go to the Department of Agriculture,
[15:20.620 --> 15:21.820]  read about what you're using
[15:21.820 --> 15:24.540]  and learn what you are applying to your plants.
[15:24.540 --> 15:26.300]  Because I'm going to take a quick dab and a drink
[15:26.300 --> 15:28.340]  and then we will get on with the show.
[15:28.340 --> 15:30.780]  Excuse me for one quick second.
[15:30.780 --> 15:32.220]  All right, you guys, I am nicely dabbed.
[15:32.220 --> 15:33.700]  I want to give a big shout out to my friend,
[15:33.700 --> 15:35.260]  Maddie from the Garden of Weden.
[15:35.260 --> 15:37.140]  I took Maddie a bunch of Girl Scout cookies,
[15:37.140 --> 15:38.540]  flowers that I grew.
[15:38.540 --> 15:42.100]  And she turned it into some delicious oil for me.
[15:42.860 --> 15:45.020]  I got some snap and peel, kind of almost shatter.
[15:45.020 --> 15:46.580]  It snaps a little more than it shatters.
[15:46.580 --> 15:47.420]  It's a little flexible.
[15:47.420 --> 15:48.260]  It's a little warm in here
[15:48.260 --> 15:49.740]  so that may have something to do with it.
[15:49.740 --> 15:50.740]  But it is golden.
[15:50.740 --> 15:51.580]  It is beautiful.
[15:51.580 --> 15:53.300]  It smells amazing.
[15:53.300 --> 15:57.620]  It tastes delicious and it gets me high as shit.
[15:57.620 --> 15:59.020]  So a big shout out to Maddie
[15:59.020 --> 16:00.740]  for the amazing Girl Scout cookies, Hash.
[16:00.740 --> 16:01.580]  I appreciate it.
[16:01.580 --> 16:02.400]  Great work, girl.
[16:02.400 --> 16:03.240]  Nice job.
[16:03.240 --> 16:05.100]  I look forward to bringing you some more material
[16:05.100 --> 16:07.980]  to turn into Hash for me.
[16:07.980 --> 16:09.420]  All right, you guys, I've got another news article
[16:09.420 --> 16:10.260]  on the screen.
[16:10.260 --> 16:12.900]  It comes from our neighbors to the north out of Canada.
[16:12.900 --> 16:15.000]  This article was sent to me by our good buddy, Mike.
[16:15.000 --> 16:15.840]  What's up, Mike?
[16:15.840 --> 16:17.060]  Thanks for sending me some news.
[16:17.060 --> 16:18.580]  Sorry you couldn't join me tonight.
[16:18.580 --> 16:21.180]  Mike's hanging out with his lovely wife and their new baby.
[16:21.180 --> 16:22.540]  So big shout out to all of them.
[16:22.540 --> 16:24.060]  Big shout out to the Mike family.
[16:24.060 --> 16:24.900]  Hope everybody's doing well.
[16:24.900 --> 16:26.360]  Make sure you guys follow Mike on Twitter.
[16:26.360 --> 16:28.100]  It's at Nemopunk15.
[16:28.100 --> 16:32.200]  He posts a whole bunch of great cannabis news,
[16:32.200 --> 16:33.380]  things that will educate you,
[16:33.380 --> 16:35.340]  things you would appreciate seeing.
[16:35.340 --> 16:36.180]  So like I said,
[16:36.180 --> 16:38.340]  this article comes from our good friends in Canada.
[16:38.340 --> 16:39.660]  Shout out to Canada.
[16:39.660 --> 16:42.220]  Canada has elected a new prime minister
[16:42.220 --> 16:43.620]  who seems to be on our side.
[16:43.620 --> 16:45.660]  You guys, this article comes from Vice News.
[16:45.660 --> 16:47.260]  It was written by Rachel Brown.
[16:47.260 --> 16:48.080]  The headline says,
[16:48.080 --> 16:50.460]  Trudeau held the best thing that's ever happened
[16:50.460 --> 16:51.780]  to Canadian weed.
[16:51.780 --> 16:54.420]  And the article goes like this.
[16:54.420 --> 16:56.940]  Justin Trudeau hasn't even been officially sworn in
[16:56.940 --> 16:58.240]  as prime minister yet,
[16:58.240 --> 17:00.540]  but as far as marijuana advocates are concerned,
[17:00.540 --> 17:04.260]  his promise to fully legalize it as, sorry,
[17:04.260 --> 17:07.700]  his promise to fully legalize it is as good as fulfilled.
[17:07.700 --> 17:09.140]  Potts Legal wrote, Mark Emery,
[17:09.660 --> 17:10.740]  Canada's so-called Prince of Pot,
[17:10.740 --> 17:12.580]  the day after Trudeau and his liberal party
[17:12.580 --> 17:15.200]  won the federal election by a landslide.
[17:15.200 --> 17:17.740]  One of Mr. Trudeau's official declarations should be,
[17:17.740 --> 17:21.220]  the war against cannabis culture in Canada is over.
[17:21.220 --> 17:22.820]  By securing a majority government,
[17:22.820 --> 17:25.260]  the liberals are poised to move quickly on their pledge
[17:25.260 --> 17:29.860]  to legalize, regulate, and restrict access to marijuana
[17:29.860 --> 17:31.000]  for recreational use,
[17:31.000 --> 17:34.340]  which Trudeau has billed as a top priority.
[17:34.340 --> 17:37.380]  Though the incoming prime minister has yet to specify
[17:37.420 --> 17:40.540]  what exactly legalizations would look like,
[17:40.540 --> 17:42.540]  and it could take years for it to come to fruition,
[17:42.540 --> 17:44.860]  things are already looking up for the industry.
[17:44.860 --> 17:46.220]  Because I'm stuttering in this article,
[17:46.220 --> 17:47.540]  so I'm gonna reach over to my right,
[17:47.540 --> 17:50.280]  and I'm gonna grab some of this Girl Scout Cookies dab,
[17:50.280 --> 17:51.540]  reaching, reaching.
[17:51.540 --> 17:53.100]  Or the Girl Scout Cookies hash, sorry,
[17:53.100 --> 17:53.940]  I don't even know what I'm saying.
[17:53.940 --> 17:56.600]  Grabbing some of this hash, unfolding the parchment,
[17:56.600 --> 17:58.980]  getting myself a big fat dab, here we go.
[17:58.980 --> 18:00.300]  Getting a dab.
[18:00.300 --> 18:01.940]  And I'm gonna grab the e-nail,
[18:01.940 --> 18:03.500]  I'm gonna grab the rig that has the e-nail on it,
[18:03.500 --> 18:05.400]  that'll work a lot better for my fingers.
[18:05.400 --> 18:06.740]  I'm gonna grab the little Hitman rig
[18:07.100 --> 18:08.100]  with the drop down from Elevate.
[18:08.100 --> 18:10.460]  It's got the highly educated D-nail attachment to it,
[18:10.460 --> 18:14.540]  which is running to the G-nail box by Emotech and Giddyup.
[18:14.540 --> 18:15.380]  So shout out to all the people
[18:15.380 --> 18:17.180]  that got me doing a fat dab right now.
[18:17.180 --> 18:20.420]  Let's do a dab, and let's cure my stutter problem
[18:20.420 --> 18:21.820]  on this podcast, here we go.
[18:29.090 --> 18:30.690]  Aw yeah, there we go.
[18:30.690 --> 18:32.750]  I'm carb capping and freestyle rapping.
[18:34.310 --> 18:35.450]  That's a little better.
[18:36.490 --> 18:38.210]  All right, I'm pretty sure I was reading an article.
[18:38.210 --> 18:41.490]  Now let's find where I was, where was I?
[18:41.490 --> 18:42.610]  The morning after the election,
[18:42.610 --> 18:44.370]  stocks soared for three of the country's
[18:44.370 --> 18:46.170]  top medical marijuana producers.
[18:46.170 --> 18:48.250]  Some cannabis companies, Canada,
[18:48.250 --> 18:50.050]  began trading publicly last year
[18:50.050 --> 18:52.130]  after Health Canada started issuing licenses
[18:52.130 --> 18:53.810]  to companies for the country's estimated
[18:53.810 --> 18:57.330]  40,000 registered medical cannabis users.
[18:57.330 --> 18:59.610]  One study suggests there are 2.3 million
[18:59.610 --> 19:01.610]  marijuana users in Canada.
[19:01.610 --> 19:03.130]  That's an oddly worded statement there
[19:03.130 --> 19:05.010]  at the end of that paragraph.
[19:05.010 --> 19:06.410]  The current medical marijuana industry
[19:06.410 --> 19:10.810]  is believed to be worth between 80 and $100 million.
[19:10.810 --> 19:12.090]  It's believed to be one of the best
[19:12.090 --> 19:13.650]  regulatory systems in the world,
[19:13.650 --> 19:15.370]  and is highly regulated.
[19:15.370 --> 19:18.050]  Aaron Sals, an analyst with Dundee Capital Markets,
[19:18.050 --> 19:21.050]  told the Financial Post that it could balloon
[19:21.050 --> 19:25.210]  to $5 billion if the market is fully legalized.
[19:25.210 --> 19:27.050]  It feels like they're missing a couple short words here,
[19:27.050 --> 19:29.090]  like thes and ands in some spots, it's weird.
[19:29.090 --> 19:30.890]  Anyway, the Canadian marijuana space
[19:30.890 --> 19:33.570]  could be set for another revolution, Sals said.
[19:33.570 --> 19:35.930]  Bruce Linton, CEO of Tweed, the largest
[19:35.930 --> 19:39.050]  of Canada's 26 licensed cannabis producers,
[19:39.050 --> 19:41.090]  told Vice News in a previous interview
[19:41.090 --> 19:42.570]  that the medical marijuana industry
[19:42.570 --> 19:45.330]  can only benefit under a new legal regime,
[19:45.330 --> 19:47.370]  as it will likely facilitate the production
[19:47.370 --> 19:49.690]  for recreational marijuana similarly
[19:49.690 --> 19:52.930]  to the way things unfolded in Colorado.
[19:52.930 --> 19:54.610]  I would think that for licensed producers,
[19:54.610 --> 19:56.810]  which are large, regulated, and under-controlled
[19:56.810 --> 19:59.450]  shipping and accounting procedures,
[19:59.450 --> 20:01.850]  what, which are large, regulated, and under-controlled
[20:01.850 --> 20:03.150]  shipping and accounting procedures,
[20:03.150 --> 20:04.530]  would be the first choice for delivery
[20:04.530 --> 20:06.250]  because that's the first methodology
[20:06.250 --> 20:08.890]  to gain control of the supply chain, said Linton.
[20:09.730 --> 20:10.930]  Those running Vancouver's marijuana dispensaries,
[20:10.930 --> 20:13.050]  which operate in a legal gray zone
[20:13.050 --> 20:15.090]  because they sell marijuana without licenses
[20:15.090 --> 20:16.970]  from Health Canada, are looking forward
[20:16.970 --> 20:18.930]  to a fully legalized industry.
[20:18.930 --> 20:20.650]  Earlier this year, Health Canada threatened
[20:20.650 --> 20:24.210]  to send some Royal Canadian Mounted Police Officers
[20:24.210 --> 20:25.690]  to shut them down.
[20:25.690 --> 20:28.410]  We're dancing in the streets, said Don Pereira,
[20:28.410 --> 20:31.610]  who owns a number of Vancouver dispensaries.
[20:31.610 --> 20:34.730]  The Week Jacob, this week, Jacob Securities,
[20:34.730 --> 20:36.970]  a Toronto-based investment firm that specializes
[20:36.970 --> 20:39.610]  in advising companies on the cannabis sector,
[20:39.610 --> 20:41.970]  launched a $50 million cannabis fund
[20:41.970 --> 20:45.410]  to focus on opportunities in Canada and the US.
[20:45.410 --> 20:47.530]  Justin Trudeau getting elected is the best thing
[20:47.530 --> 20:49.850]  that's ever happened to the cannabis industry,
[20:49.850 --> 20:52.330]  Cheryl Schumann, founder of the Beverly Hills Cannabis Club
[20:52.330 --> 20:54.330]  and one of the fund's lead advisors said
[20:54.330 --> 20:56.090]  in an interview with Vice News.
[20:56.090 --> 20:59.290]  Within the last 72 hours, it's like open season in Canada
[20:59.290 --> 21:00.850]  and the opportunities to invest there
[21:00.850 --> 21:02.210]  keep growing and growing.
[21:02.210 --> 21:04.170]  It's like wildfire spreading.
[21:04.170 --> 21:06.570]  Speaking of Cheryl Schumann, I wanna give a huge shout out
[21:07.210 --> 21:08.050]  to my buddy, Mickey Martin.
[21:08.050 --> 21:08.890]  What up, Mickey Martin?
[21:08.890 --> 21:11.570]  Shout out to Mickey Martin and Mickey Martin Consulting.
[21:11.570 --> 21:12.890]  That's what I'm saying.
[21:12.890 --> 21:14.410]  I'm gonna keep going with the article here.
[21:14.410 --> 21:15.730]  If you guys know what I'm talking about,
[21:15.730 --> 21:17.690]  high five me mentally right now.
[21:17.690 --> 21:20.490]  The firm's other lead advisor is George Smitherman,
[21:20.490 --> 21:22.570]  Ontario's former health minister.
[21:22.570 --> 21:24.570]  Analysts have suggested that a fully legalized
[21:24.570 --> 21:26.410]  marijuana industry could attract investors
[21:26.410 --> 21:28.610]  from the alcohol and tobacco industries.
[21:28.610 --> 21:30.690]  Last month, addiction specialists wrote a piece
[21:30.690 --> 21:32.730]  in the Canadian Medical Association Journal
[21:32.730 --> 21:34.890]  urging whichever party forms government
[21:34.890 --> 21:37.130]  to move away from cannabis prohibition
[21:37.130 --> 21:39.170]  but also retain control over the supply
[21:39.170 --> 21:40.970]  and sale of recreational marijuana
[21:40.970 --> 21:42.850]  should it become legalized.
[21:42.850 --> 21:45.050]  A frequently cited concern with legalization
[21:45.050 --> 21:47.410]  is that it will allow the rise of big cannabis
[21:47.410 --> 21:50.250]  similar to big tobacco and big alcohol.
[21:50.250 --> 21:52.410]  These powerful multinational corporations
[21:52.410 --> 21:55.610]  have revenues and market expansion as their primary goals
[21:55.610 --> 21:58.730]  with little consideration of the impact on public health,
[21:58.730 --> 22:00.170]  the article states.
[22:00.170 --> 22:02.410]  You guys, that's something that we kind of overlooked here
[22:02.610 --> 22:05.170]  when we started writing all of our marijuana laws
[22:05.170 --> 22:07.690]  in Colorado, in California.
[22:07.690 --> 22:10.690]  We kind of forgot that big cannabis would take over
[22:10.690 --> 22:12.690]  and I see it happening.
[22:12.690 --> 22:15.170]  That's what's happening here in Colorado.
[22:15.170 --> 22:17.210]  If you don't have, there were tons of shops here
[22:17.210 --> 22:18.410]  that were mom and pop shops.
[22:18.410 --> 22:20.010]  Guys like myself with some dreadlocks
[22:20.010 --> 22:22.330]  and some growing skills would grow our hearts out,
[22:22.330 --> 22:24.290]  open up a shop and get shit going.
[22:24.290 --> 22:25.690]  But then all of the new regulations
[22:25.690 --> 22:28.010]  have pushed people in that realm out
[22:28.010 --> 22:30.050]  because it is so expensive to open up a shop.
[22:30.050 --> 22:32.010]  It's so expensive to afford all of the security.
[22:32.530 --> 22:34.410]  It's so expensive to pay for all of the licensing
[22:34.410 --> 22:38.690]  that only rich dudes that don't know anything about cannabis
[22:38.690 --> 22:39.570]  can own dispensaries.
[22:39.570 --> 22:40.930]  Now that is not 100% true,
[22:40.930 --> 22:42.850]  but that is a lot of what I saw happen.
[22:42.850 --> 22:44.570]  There are a lot of people that held on,
[22:44.570 --> 22:47.370]  a lot of people that persevered and made it in the industry,
[22:47.370 --> 22:49.370]  but very few of them survived.
[22:49.370 --> 22:51.210]  Big shout out to Scott Reach for making it.
[22:51.210 --> 22:53.930]  That dude made it from the beginning, killing it.
[22:53.930 --> 22:56.210]  You guys, if you want to be a cannabis entrepreneur,
[22:56.210 --> 22:58.730]  find out who Scott Reach is and read about that dude,
[22:58.730 --> 23:00.210]  learn how that dude did it,
[23:00.210 --> 23:01.410]  and you'll realize that you can do
[23:01.410 --> 23:02.890]  whatever the hell you want.
[23:02.890 --> 23:04.490]  I'm gonna continue with the article.
[23:04.490 --> 23:06.250]  In August, Trudeau said his new government
[23:06.250 --> 23:07.730]  would look into pardoning Canadians
[23:07.730 --> 23:10.170]  serving time in prison for marijuana-related crimes
[23:10.170 --> 23:12.890]  after he repeals the laws in the criminal code.
[23:12.890 --> 23:15.410]  This dude's gonna go and release
[23:15.410 --> 23:16.970]  Canadians serving time in prison
[23:16.970 --> 23:18.730]  for marijuana-related crimes.
[23:18.730 --> 23:20.490]  Their new prime minister is awesome, you guys.
[23:20.490 --> 23:22.730]  Could you imagine if we got a president like this in America?
[23:22.730 --> 23:23.810]  I mean, it's highly unlikely,
[23:23.810 --> 23:25.330]  but could you imagine if that shit happened?
[23:25.330 --> 23:28.890]  It would be so amazing if our president actually,
[23:28.970 --> 23:31.050]  if our government actually governed us
[23:31.050 --> 23:32.970]  in a way that we found favorable
[23:32.970 --> 23:34.770]  instead of governing us in a way
[23:34.770 --> 23:36.730]  that we all feel like we're getting ripped the fuck off
[23:36.730 --> 23:40.370]  and it's only benefiting 1% of our nation.
[23:40.370 --> 23:41.690]  It'd be amazing if they actually felt
[23:41.690 --> 23:43.210]  some compassion for us, right?
[23:43.210 --> 23:44.930]  There's one more paragraph in this article, you guys.
[23:44.930 --> 23:46.290]  I will continue.
[23:46.290 --> 23:47.970]  There's been many situations over history
[23:47.970 --> 23:50.890]  when laws come in that overturn,
[23:50.890 --> 23:53.650]  laws come in that overturn previous convictions,
[23:53.650 --> 23:55.570]  he said, at a campaign stop in Vancouver,
[23:55.570 --> 23:57.530]  and there will be a process for that
[23:57.530 --> 24:00.570]  that we will set up in a responsible way.
[24:00.570 --> 24:01.930]  You guys also make sure you follow the lady
[24:01.930 --> 24:03.010]  that wrote this article.
[24:03.010 --> 24:04.210]  Her name is Rachel Brown.
[24:04.210 --> 24:07.010]  She's on Twitter at RP underscore Brown,
[24:07.010 --> 24:09.050]  Brown with an E at the end.
[24:09.050 --> 24:13.290]  So Canada has basically legalized cannabis.
[24:13.290 --> 24:15.810]  This new prime minister, Trudeau, Justin Trudeau,
[24:15.810 --> 24:17.610]  I hope I'm saying that right,
[24:17.610 --> 24:20.210]  Justin Trudeau says that when he gets into office,
[24:20.210 --> 24:22.570]  he's gonna do what he can to make cannabis legal.
[24:22.570 --> 24:24.290]  You know, I heard him say, I didn't hear him,
[24:24.290 --> 24:26.570]  he said in an article that I read
[24:26.570 --> 24:29.210]  that within 18 months of him taking office,
[24:29.210 --> 24:31.650]  he would legalize cannabis.
[24:31.650 --> 24:33.690]  I did some looking, I did some thinking,
[24:33.690 --> 24:35.930]  18 months after this dude takes office
[24:35.930 --> 24:38.410]  will be the middle of April.
[24:38.410 --> 24:42.890]  So by 420 in 2017, is that when it'll be?
[24:42.890 --> 24:47.850]  16, 2017, 420, Canada will have legalized cannabis.
[24:47.850 --> 24:49.650]  If I did that math wrong, let me know.
[24:49.650 --> 24:52.410]  I don't have a corrections department that is you guys.
[24:53.930 --> 24:55.770]  All right, you guys, that's all I've got for you this week.
[24:55.770 --> 24:58.030]  I'm working on the episode about CBD still.
[24:58.030 --> 25:00.550]  Mike and Doug came over and touched a little bit on that.
[25:00.550 --> 25:03.810]  I've got a lot more stuff to talk about CBD wise.
[25:03.810 --> 25:05.770]  I've got a whole bunch of great stuff planned for you.
[25:05.770 --> 25:08.010]  I wanna thank you guys for listening to another episode.
