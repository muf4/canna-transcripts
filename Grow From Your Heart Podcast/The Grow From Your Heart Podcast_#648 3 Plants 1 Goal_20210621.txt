[01:32.880 --> 01:35.200]  I'm excited to be on a microphone.
[01:35.200 --> 01:38.320]  The last episode I tried to record I did not sound very professional.
[01:38.320 --> 01:40.080]  I did not sound very healthy.
[01:40.080 --> 01:43.700]  I want to thank everybody for all of the well wishes, all of the kind words.
[01:43.700 --> 01:45.360]  Everybody said hey bro I hope you feel better soon.
[01:45.360 --> 01:46.680]  I hope everything is better.
[01:46.680 --> 01:48.040]  I didn't feel sick at all.
[01:48.040 --> 01:51.040]  I felt great but my throat just didn't sound good.
[01:51.040 --> 01:52.580]  So thank you for all the kind words.
[01:52.580 --> 01:53.960]  Thank you for all of the support.
[01:53.960 --> 01:57.600]  And thank you for watching the short episode that I put out for Thursday.
[01:57.600 --> 02:01.640]  I do kind of apologize for putting out a short shitty episode but sometimes that's how life
[02:01.640 --> 02:02.640]  is going to go.
[02:02.640 --> 02:04.080]  I did not miss a show.
[02:04.080 --> 02:05.520]  You got a podcast.
[02:05.520 --> 02:06.520]  Thank you.
[02:06.520 --> 02:09.240]  Thank you for all of the kind words and all of the support.
[02:09.240 --> 02:10.240]  Thank you.
[02:10.240 --> 02:11.240]  I appreciate that.
[02:11.240 --> 02:15.920]  Also thanks to everybody who sent ideas and tips and tricks and recipes and what are they
[02:15.920 --> 02:17.000]  called remedies.
[02:17.000 --> 02:18.680]  That's the word I'm searching in my brain.
[02:18.680 --> 02:22.040]  Thanks for all of the home remedies to get my throat back together.
[02:22.040 --> 02:25.200]  Hopefully one of them or a combination of them did the trick.
[02:25.200 --> 02:27.080]  I'm excited to be back here on the microphone.
[02:27.080 --> 02:29.120]  So I'm chattery ready to go.
[02:29.120 --> 02:30.120]  Thank you guys.
[02:30.120 --> 02:31.120]  I do appreciate it.
[02:31.120 --> 02:33.880]  I did smoke some arise rosin today.
[02:33.880 --> 02:37.120]  Big shout out to a local grower who would rather remain anonymous.
[02:37.120 --> 02:41.080]  He doesn't want people to know what he's doing around here which is kind of smart.
[02:41.080 --> 02:44.080]  But my friend made he grew he got some seeds of arise from me.
[02:44.080 --> 02:45.080]  He grew the arise.
[02:45.080 --> 02:47.640]  He selected a phenotype that he thought would press well.
[02:47.640 --> 02:49.600]  He squished it into rosin.
[02:49.600 --> 02:51.360]  I'm usually not a big fan of the rosin.
[02:51.680 --> 02:52.680]  But you know what?
[02:52.680 --> 02:57.240]  You guys are getting better at making the rosin and this shit was hot fire.
[02:57.240 --> 03:01.640]  He watched my face really carefully as I took the dab because my face gives me away.
[03:01.640 --> 03:03.280]  Sometimes I'll try to say yeah that dab was tasty.
[03:03.280 --> 03:04.560]  That dab was really good.
[03:04.560 --> 03:07.800]  But then my cheeks and my eyes and my lips will say man this dab tastes like fucking
[03:07.800 --> 03:09.920]  shit and I want to throw up from hitting it.
[03:09.920 --> 03:11.320]  But my buddy was watching me the whole time.
[03:11.320 --> 03:12.520]  He's like bro you seem to like that.
[03:12.520 --> 03:15.320]  And I was like dude this dab tastes so good.
[03:15.320 --> 03:19.800]  It did not taste what arise was familiar to taste like to me.
[03:19.800 --> 03:23.320]  That sentence came out oddly but it didn't taste what I'm familiar with arise tasting
[03:23.320 --> 03:26.600]  like that concentrate made it taste a little bit different.
[03:26.600 --> 03:27.600]  I liked it.
[03:27.600 --> 03:28.720]  I actually did enjoy it.
[03:28.720 --> 03:33.640]  The high was completely different than what I'm used to from any phenotype I've ever smoked
[03:33.640 --> 03:34.960]  arise of arise.
[03:34.960 --> 03:39.840]  So I'm going fast and I'm excited but I've never gotten that buzz from arise.
[03:39.840 --> 03:42.320]  I've smoked a lot of arise.
[03:42.320 --> 03:43.320]  Smoked several phenotypes.
[03:43.320 --> 03:46.160]  I've smoked it in concentrate form flower form.
[03:46.160 --> 03:51.760]  I've smoked it in now I've smoked it in rosin and solventless concentrate form and usually
[03:51.760 --> 03:52.760]  it gets my head moving.
[03:52.760 --> 03:55.760]  It makes me kind of think it makes me want to like talk a lot makes me want to get on
[03:55.760 --> 03:56.760]  the microphone.
[03:56.760 --> 03:59.200]  When I exhaled that dab I wanted to like sit down.
[03:59.200 --> 04:02.880]  I was like oh oh and I just kept I said I was melting.
[04:02.880 --> 04:03.880]  I was like bro I'm melting.
[04:03.880 --> 04:06.400]  I'm fucking becoming part of this chair.
[04:06.400 --> 04:10.480]  Remember that commercial back in the day when the girl did drugs and she became the chair.
[04:10.480 --> 04:13.560]  It was almost working for me and if you've got that weed that makes you become the chair
[04:13.560 --> 04:14.560]  I'll take a quarter.
[04:14.560 --> 04:20.080]  I'll take a I'll take an ounce but that's just a joke YouTube don't get at me.
[04:20.080 --> 04:22.440]  But where was I that that concentrate made me melt.
[04:22.440 --> 04:23.440]  It was great.
[04:23.440 --> 04:26.000]  It was delicious but it was it caught me off guard because it was a completely the first
[04:26.000 --> 04:29.360]  thing I noticed was oh that's a totally different flavor.
[04:29.360 --> 04:32.600]  Usually the arise has a cushiness with a sweetness to it.
[04:32.600 --> 04:36.520]  This one had almost a tropical spiciness.
[04:36.520 --> 04:40.400]  I'm going to say mango habanero and that's the closest thing I can get to.
[04:40.400 --> 04:44.680]  I've had mango habanero salsa and it reminded me of that in a very good way.
[04:44.680 --> 04:49.220]  It had a spicy thing but it had that sweet mango to it and when I blew it out my arm
[04:49.220 --> 04:54.060]  hair moved and when I know that when I exhale a dab if my arm hair moves that is a tremendous
[04:54.060 --> 04:55.060]  freaking dab.
[04:55.060 --> 04:58.720]  So my arm hair went wobble wobble wobble when I blew it out and then I got like super sat
[04:58.720 --> 05:02.840]  down I wanted to like chill out and melt into the couch and usually the arise makes me move
[05:02.840 --> 05:04.240]  makes me go faster.
[05:04.240 --> 05:05.400]  So that was a big surprise.
[05:05.400 --> 05:07.400]  Big shout out to my buddy for the arise.
[05:07.400 --> 05:11.560]  And apparently being on the mic and smoking arise got me fucking super excited today.
[05:11.560 --> 05:13.280]  So shout out for all of that.
[05:13.280 --> 05:16.720]  Let's see it got me high as shit is a note that I wrote high as fuck is what I wrote
[05:16.720 --> 05:18.120]  down so there you go.
[05:18.120 --> 05:22.000]  I want to give a big thank you and a big shout out to everybody who supports the show on
[05:22.000 --> 05:23.000]  YouTube.
[05:23.000 --> 05:27.160]  We recently surpassed the 7000 subscriber mark on YouTube.
[05:27.160 --> 05:30.240]  That's right we've got 7000 YouTube subscribers.
[05:30.240 --> 05:31.240]  Thank you.
[05:31.240 --> 05:35.160]  I think putting out the episodes about topping and cloning really helped out with subscriptions.
[05:35.160 --> 05:36.520]  It got a lot of followers.
[05:36.640 --> 05:38.520]  Those episodes got a lot of views.
[05:38.520 --> 05:42.120]  Those are two of my most viewed episodes and they are brand new in the feed which means
[05:42.120 --> 05:44.640]  they're only going to become even more watched.
[05:44.640 --> 05:47.160]  They're going to stay on YouTube forever so people keep watching.
[05:47.160 --> 05:49.320]  But a lot of people have watched those episodes.
[05:49.320 --> 05:52.120]  They got us to 7000 YouTube subscribers.
[05:52.120 --> 05:53.120]  Thank you.
[05:53.120 --> 05:54.120]  Thank you.
[05:54.120 --> 05:55.120]  I do appreciate it.
[05:55.120 --> 05:56.120]  Thanks to each and every one of you.
[05:56.120 --> 05:58.040]  Now I'm going to look like an ass and say that's not enough.
[05:58.040 --> 05:59.960]  I want more subscribers.
[05:59.960 --> 06:01.560]  Not just because I want more for the show.
[06:01.560 --> 06:05.600]  Not just because I want more people watching because I want people growing better herb
[06:05.600 --> 06:06.600]  out there.
[06:06.600 --> 06:08.480]  I think that I teach you how to grow a quality product.
[06:08.480 --> 06:10.040]  I don't pitch you too many products.
[06:10.040 --> 06:12.240]  The only products I pitch you are products I actually use.
[06:12.240 --> 06:15.240]  No company says hey we'll give you money if you advertise this.
[06:15.240 --> 06:16.580]  That's not the way it works with me.
[06:16.580 --> 06:19.280]  If I use a product and I like it I say buy this.
[06:19.280 --> 06:21.000]  I don't get paid for advertising.
[06:21.000 --> 06:24.240]  When I don't come on here I don't shove a bunch of products down your throat.
[06:24.240 --> 06:26.380]  I don't beg you for a bunch of stuff.
[06:26.380 --> 06:28.640]  So let's get more people watching the show is my point.
[06:28.640 --> 06:31.000]  That way more people can grow better cannabis.
[06:31.000 --> 06:33.160]  If all of the growers are watching they're all learning.
[06:33.160 --> 06:34.360]  We're all going to step up our game.
[06:34.360 --> 06:37.680]  That means every time you go somewhere to smoke there will be better herb there if we're
[06:37.680 --> 06:39.560]  all growing better herb.
[06:39.560 --> 06:41.000]  Also we'll all help to legalize cannabis.
[06:41.000 --> 06:42.920]  We'll all get in the same mindset.
[06:42.920 --> 06:45.120]  We're all going to legalize this plant together.
[06:45.120 --> 06:46.800]  It'll be a big unification.
[06:46.800 --> 06:48.360]  Cannabis is the healing of the nation.
[06:48.360 --> 06:49.360]  The great uniter.
[06:49.360 --> 06:50.360]  The unifier.
[06:50.360 --> 06:51.360]  So let's do this.
[06:51.360 --> 06:52.360]  Let's get everybody on board.
[06:52.360 --> 06:53.360]  Tell some friends.
[06:53.360 --> 06:55.560]  Invite some friends to subscribe to the podcast.
[06:55.560 --> 06:57.400]  Also one more big shout out.
[06:57.400 --> 07:03.520]  We finally surpassed and have steadily held at over 200 patrons on Patreon.
[07:03.680 --> 07:04.680]  Thank you.
[07:04.680 --> 07:05.680]  That is amazing to me.
[07:05.680 --> 07:08.600]  Every month 200 people choose to support the show.
[07:08.600 --> 07:09.600]  Thank you.
[07:09.600 --> 07:11.560]  If you are a new Patreon supporter.
[07:11.560 --> 07:13.640]  If you're old school from back in the day.
[07:13.640 --> 07:14.760]  Sincerely thank you.
[07:14.760 --> 07:16.060]  That does mean the world to me.
[07:16.060 --> 07:17.060]  Money is expensive.
[07:17.060 --> 07:20.800]  We've gone through a very hard time in the economy in the world.
[07:20.800 --> 07:24.400]  Things have been really weird and if you have chosen to throw money my direction that does
[07:24.400 --> 07:25.400]  mean a lot to me.
[07:25.400 --> 07:26.400]  I do notice it.
[07:26.400 --> 07:27.680]  There are 200 of you.
[07:27.680 --> 07:30.480]  I try to send messages on Patreon and say thanks.
[07:30.480 --> 07:32.480]  I try to interact with Patreon.
[07:32.480 --> 07:33.480]  Honestly there's just one of me.
[07:33.480 --> 07:34.480]  I've got a seed company.
[07:34.480 --> 07:35.480]  I've got the podcast.
[07:35.480 --> 07:36.480]  I've got a normal life.
[07:36.480 --> 07:38.720]  I don't talk about it a lot but I'm really proud of it.
[07:38.720 --> 07:40.480]  My daughter just graduated high school.
[07:40.480 --> 07:45.320]  She just turned 18 and she's moving out and moving to her own place soon.
[07:45.320 --> 07:46.820]  You guys are creeps so leave her alone.
[07:46.820 --> 07:51.280]  But things have been busy and I stay overwhelmed and overloaded but I really do try to participate
[07:51.280 --> 07:53.480]  in the Patreon as much as I can.
[07:53.480 --> 07:54.800]  Thank you guys for all of the support.
[07:54.800 --> 07:59.640]  It does mean the world to me that you take money is expensive and you choose to take
[07:59.640 --> 08:02.720]  some of your hard earned money and funnel it my direction.
[08:02.720 --> 08:03.720]  Thank you.
[08:03.720 --> 08:04.720]  I appreciate that.
[08:04.720 --> 08:05.720]  I really do love it.
[08:05.720 --> 08:06.720]  It does keep the show moving also.
[08:06.720 --> 08:07.720]  It keeps all the gear updated.
[08:07.720 --> 08:09.280]  I've got some fresh paint on the walls.
[08:09.280 --> 08:11.280]  I'm sure you see a new angle here.
[08:11.280 --> 08:12.280]  Thank you.
[08:12.280 --> 08:13.280]  I appreciate the support.
[08:13.280 --> 08:14.280]  Alright.
[08:14.280 --> 08:16.960]  I've done enough rambling, enough gushing, enough shout outs.
[08:16.960 --> 08:19.360]  We've gone almost 10 minutes.
[08:19.360 --> 08:22.760]  Let's get into the podcast portion of the podcast.
[08:22.760 --> 08:25.720]  Let's talk about growing cannabis here.
[08:25.720 --> 08:31.000]  Somebody asked me recently what do I need to grow three plants?
[08:31.000 --> 08:35.920]  How big of a space do I need to grow three plants?
[08:35.920 --> 08:37.440]  That's a great question.
[08:37.440 --> 08:41.000]  If you want to grow three plants, somebody's got the idea, hey I want to grow weed.
[08:41.000 --> 08:42.920]  In Colorado we're allowed to grow six plants.
[08:42.920 --> 08:45.460]  You can have three in veg, three in flour.
[08:45.460 --> 08:47.760]  This person doesn't want to design two spaces.
[08:47.760 --> 08:50.600]  They want to grow three plants.
[08:50.600 --> 08:54.120]  When they said how much space do I need to grow three plants, a lot of things went off
[08:54.120 --> 08:55.120]  in my head.
[08:55.120 --> 09:00.360]  I thought, well you could grow three plants in a little computer tower.
[09:00.720 --> 09:01.960]  Remember those old school computer towers?
[09:01.960 --> 09:05.320]  They're about a foot tall, they're about a foot wide, they're probably six or eight or
[09:05.320 --> 09:08.880]  about a foot tall, a foot deep and six or eight inches wide.
[09:08.880 --> 09:12.200]  That's enough space to hang a small light and you can grow three plants in there.
[09:12.200 --> 09:15.120]  Of course your plants are going to be six inches tall.
[09:15.120 --> 09:18.760]  They'll probably be in a solo cup will be their source, but they're going to be little
[09:18.760 --> 09:20.400]  tiny plants.
[09:20.400 --> 09:23.320]  You can have gigantic plants that you have vegged.
[09:23.320 --> 09:27.640]  You can start vegging plants today and not put them outside until next year if you choose
[09:27.640 --> 09:31.000]  to do so if you have the proper care and equipment for them.
[09:31.000 --> 09:38.240]  So three plants could be anywhere from a six inch by six inch space to five acres.
[09:38.240 --> 09:41.360]  Honestly, it just depends on what you want to do with these plants, how you care for
[09:41.360 --> 09:42.620]  them and what your goal is.
[09:42.620 --> 09:44.000]  So let's talk a little bit about that.
[09:44.000 --> 09:45.800]  What do I need for three plants?
[09:45.800 --> 09:46.880]  How big are the plants?
[09:46.880 --> 09:47.880]  What is your goal?
[09:47.880 --> 09:50.400]  I talk about your goal all the time.
[09:50.400 --> 09:52.800]  If you don't have a goal, how do you succeed?
[09:52.800 --> 09:54.840]  You've got to set yourself up for success.
[09:54.840 --> 09:55.840]  That's a phrase I use a lot.
[09:55.840 --> 09:59.520]  I learned it from a teacher in seventh grade and I will never forget it.
[09:59.520 --> 10:01.000]  Set yourself up for success.
[10:01.000 --> 10:02.000]  Shout out to Miss Dodson.
[10:02.000 --> 10:04.440]  I hope you're still around.
[10:04.440 --> 10:05.800]  But set yourself up for success.
[10:05.800 --> 10:07.420]  You can fucking try.
[10:07.420 --> 10:09.480]  You can hope you can hope things come out well.
[10:09.480 --> 10:15.080]  You could pray for shit to go right or you can do some work and set yourself up for success.
[10:15.080 --> 10:18.520]  The way to set yourself up for success is to know your goal.
[10:18.520 --> 10:21.240]  What is the end outcome desired goal?
[10:21.240 --> 10:25.120]  When you look down the road and you say, I want to do this, what is the goal there at
[10:25.160 --> 10:26.160]  the end?
[10:26.160 --> 10:27.160]  What do you really want to accomplish?
[10:27.160 --> 10:28.960]  Then you're going to say, I want to grow some weed.
[10:28.960 --> 10:31.320]  Yeah, that's a logical fucking step right there.
[10:31.320 --> 10:35.840]  But how much weed, how often weed, what kind of weed, like realistically, how much space
[10:35.840 --> 10:36.840]  do you have?
[10:36.840 --> 10:37.960]  How much time can you commit to this?
[10:37.960 --> 10:39.240]  What's in the budget?
[10:39.240 --> 10:43.480]  What does my electrical load in my house or wherever I'm choosing to grow?
[10:43.480 --> 10:44.840]  What is that going to support?
[10:44.840 --> 10:46.080]  So what is your goal?
[10:46.080 --> 10:47.480]  Your realistic goal?
[10:47.480 --> 10:50.780]  Find a goal is the main objective to starting any project.
[10:50.780 --> 10:53.280]  So how big your plant's going to be?
[10:53.280 --> 10:54.500]  How much space are you going to use?
[10:54.880 --> 10:55.880]  How much herb do you want to produce?
[10:55.880 --> 10:57.260]  How often do you want to be?
[10:57.260 --> 10:58.260]  I've said this before.
[10:58.260 --> 11:02.620]  Do you want to produce an ounce for yourself every two months or do you want to be Pablo
[11:02.620 --> 11:05.980]  Escobar and fucking supply all of North America?
[11:05.980 --> 11:06.980]  You can do either one.
[11:06.980 --> 11:09.900]  You're just going to have to set goals and have a strategy to do this.
[11:09.900 --> 11:12.180]  So how big are your plants?
[11:12.180 --> 11:14.100]  Do you want to produce a bunch of product?
[11:14.100 --> 11:15.860]  Do you want to produce a little bit of product?
[11:15.860 --> 11:18.080]  That's one of the first things to start thinking about.
[11:18.080 --> 11:20.420]  We all want to produce as much product as we can.
[11:20.420 --> 11:22.300]  I want to pull out seven pounds a week.
[11:22.300 --> 11:24.000]  Yeah, but you got to be realistic.
[11:24.000 --> 11:25.440]  Think about electrical limitations.
[11:25.440 --> 11:26.440]  Think about space.
[11:26.440 --> 11:27.720]  Think about time.
[11:27.720 --> 11:30.360]  Are you entering a criminal element by growing so much herb?
[11:30.360 --> 11:31.360]  Are you ready for this?
[11:31.360 --> 11:34.720]  So it's all about your abilities, your goals, your skills.
[11:34.720 --> 11:38.280]  So are you growing auto plant, auto flower plants?
[11:38.280 --> 11:40.200]  Are you growing regular photo period plants?
[11:40.200 --> 11:43.840]  If you're growing autos, they're going to start to flower when they become a certain
[11:43.840 --> 11:44.840]  size.
[11:44.840 --> 11:47.000]  You'll have to build a certain size room for the auto flower plants.
[11:47.000 --> 11:49.440]  They're going to flower out around 18 inches tall.
[11:49.440 --> 11:52.080]  They'll finish out about two, maybe three feet tall.
[11:52.080 --> 11:54.320]  You've got to build a space that will support that.
[11:54.320 --> 11:58.600]  Now if you're running auto or not autos, excuse me, if you're running photo period plants,
[11:58.600 --> 12:00.440]  you control when they flower.
[12:00.440 --> 12:04.680]  So you can veg them to be two inches tall and then put them into flower and you can
[12:04.680 --> 12:06.360]  pull off a gram and a half per plant.
[12:06.360 --> 12:09.080]  Now people say, why would you do that?
[12:09.080 --> 12:16.040]  If you're going to do that, you can cram 120 Rockwell cubes onto a six by six tray.
[12:16.040 --> 12:18.640]  You can do 64, you could do 120.
[12:18.640 --> 12:20.720]  It's up to you how you want to do it.
[12:20.720 --> 12:26.920]  Or you can put one big plant under one led or under one HPS light, or you can put one
[12:26.920 --> 12:30.540]  plant and trellis it out and put it under four, 1000 watt HPS lights.
[12:30.540 --> 12:35.680]  If you really know how to do the work, it's all about your goal, your style and your needs.
[12:35.680 --> 12:36.680]  What do you want to do?
[12:36.680 --> 12:37.760]  How much space do you have?
[12:37.760 --> 12:40.120]  How much electricity do you have available?
[12:40.120 --> 12:44.180]  So a lot of it is based on your veg time and your space.
[12:44.180 --> 12:48.520]  You can put, like I've said before, you can take seedlings that are just sprouting from
[12:48.520 --> 12:51.280]  seed and a Rockwell cube and flower them out.
[12:51.280 --> 12:52.280]  They'll flower.
[12:52.280 --> 12:55.520]  If you start flowering when they're just two inches tall, they'll end up being maybe six
[12:55.520 --> 12:56.520]  inches tall.
[12:56.520 --> 12:58.880]  By the time you're done, they'll produce a gram or two.
[12:58.880 --> 13:03.560]  If you grow a hundred of them, 112 of them, you'll grow somewhere between a quarter and
[13:03.560 --> 13:08.440]  a half a pound of weed, a quarter pound and a half a pound of weed from plants this tall.
[13:08.440 --> 13:12.480]  Now, why don't people just go throwing out 200 little tiny plants?
[13:12.480 --> 13:14.600]  Because plant count is what gets you in trouble.
[13:14.600 --> 13:18.640]  In Colorado, we're allowed six plants recreationally, six plants medically.
[13:18.640 --> 13:22.040]  So I can have six plants in any household that is an adult household.
[13:22.040 --> 13:23.600]  If you've got a house, you're an adult.
[13:23.600 --> 13:28.960]  In most cases, I would assume if you're an adult, you can have six plants in Colorado.
[13:28.960 --> 13:32.440]  Then if you have a medical marijuana recommendation from your doctor that's been approved and
[13:32.440 --> 13:36.160]  certified and registered with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment
[13:36.160 --> 13:38.920]  and the Marijuana Enforcement Division, at that point, I don't know if you have to get
[13:38.920 --> 13:40.000]  the MED involved in that one.
[13:40.000 --> 13:44.160]  It's the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has to have a Colorado registry
[13:44.760 --> 13:45.760]  on file for you.
[13:45.760 --> 13:49.760]  Then you can have six more plants in your home, which allows you a maximum of 12 plants.
[13:49.760 --> 13:51.520]  Beyond that, you are now illegal.
[13:51.520 --> 13:52.680]  You are committing a crime.
[13:52.680 --> 13:54.560]  You now have an illegal grow.
[13:54.560 --> 13:55.560]  The cops are going to come.
[13:55.560 --> 13:56.560]  You're going to get busted.
[13:56.560 --> 13:58.400]  It happens a lot around here.
[13:58.400 --> 14:01.160]  So plant count is why we change numbers.
[14:01.160 --> 14:06.000]  That's why I don't just go throwing out 64 plants in a six by six tray and run them really
[14:06.000 --> 14:07.880]  quick to see what I've got and keep the keepers.
[14:07.880 --> 14:09.240]  That's why I've got to keep my numbers down.
[14:09.240 --> 14:14.200]  I would love to play with a bunch of little tiny plants on big trays under a thousand
[14:14.200 --> 14:19.440]  watt lights would be the way to do it, but limitations because of legalities.
[14:19.440 --> 14:23.080]  So since I'm limited by plant counts, I grow my plants really big.
[14:23.080 --> 14:25.480]  They don't tell me that I can't have gigantic fucking plants.
[14:25.480 --> 14:27.080]  They say I can have six of them.
[14:27.080 --> 14:29.640]  So I grow six of them the size of fucking Volkswagen's.
[14:29.640 --> 14:30.640]  Why not do it that way?
[14:30.640 --> 14:31.920]  It's still six plants.
[14:31.920 --> 14:33.140]  They're not counting branches.
[14:33.140 --> 14:34.140]  They're counting plants.
[14:34.140 --> 14:35.620]  They're counting pots and root zones.
[14:35.620 --> 14:39.900]  I've got six of them, but they just happen to look like fucking buses driving down the
[14:39.900 --> 14:40.900]  street.
[14:40.900 --> 14:43.780]  So you can put for three plants.
[14:43.780 --> 14:48.980]  Honestly, you could grow them in a, you could make a clandestine grow kit out of like a
[14:48.980 --> 14:52.880]  computer box or a little like a nightstand that you keep by the bed.
[14:52.880 --> 14:54.820]  You could make that a grow space.
[14:54.820 --> 15:00.580]  What you need is a, an environment which you can control the lights.
[15:00.580 --> 15:04.660]  You have to have a controllable dark period where you can get a hundred percent complete
[15:04.700 --> 15:05.700]  darkness.
[15:05.700 --> 15:08.620]  You need an environment where you can control the temperature and the humidity.
[15:08.620 --> 15:10.980]  The vapor pressure deficit is what that's called.
[15:10.980 --> 15:15.220]  The VPD is very crucial, especially in a small space.
[15:15.220 --> 15:17.780]  When you go to water these little plants, they start letting off water.
[15:17.780 --> 15:18.940]  There's water in the pot.
[15:18.940 --> 15:21.180]  It can get really humid in these little spaces.
[15:21.180 --> 15:25.820]  So you're going to need a way to control that VPD and that small space though.
[15:25.820 --> 15:29.180]  Also it's really advantageous because you can really dump the air out and replace the
[15:29.180 --> 15:33.660]  air super quickly in a small space with something like a computer fan or a four inch inline
[15:33.660 --> 15:34.660]  fan.
[15:34.660 --> 15:37.380]  So that's really easy to do, but it's critical that it is done.
[15:37.380 --> 15:41.420]  Then you need a light up top, just something to keep those plants going as strong as you
[15:41.420 --> 15:42.500]  can get in there.
[15:42.500 --> 15:44.460]  That doesn't create too much heat.
[15:44.460 --> 15:46.980]  That heat is going to get really high in a little container.
[15:46.980 --> 15:50.860]  So you can build just a little box out of a dresser, out of a nightstand, anything that
[15:50.860 --> 15:53.180]  will seal up and keep the light out.
[15:53.180 --> 15:56.260]  Basically that you can move some air in and out of and control the environment in there.
[15:56.260 --> 15:58.820]  That is what you really need.
[15:58.820 --> 16:02.100]  Cleanliness is ideal if you can get a good clean spot and then airflow.
[16:02.100 --> 16:04.500]  I keep talking about that airflow.
[16:04.500 --> 16:08.700]  No matter how big or small your grow is, you have to have airflow.
[16:08.700 --> 16:10.740]  People often overlook the idea of airflow.
[16:10.740 --> 16:13.940]  Like I did the lights, I did all this stuff and I'm like, cool, how are you going to replace
[16:13.940 --> 16:14.940]  that stagnant air?
[16:14.940 --> 16:16.460]  How are you going to get air moving through the canopy?
[16:16.460 --> 16:18.160]  I'm like, I never thought of that.
[16:18.160 --> 16:19.300]  Think about that part.
[16:19.300 --> 16:21.360]  You have to move air around in that grow space.
[16:21.360 --> 16:28.180]  So what you really need for three plants is an area you can seal from light.
[16:28.180 --> 16:30.560]  We don't need any light interruptions in the flowering phase.
[16:30.560 --> 16:34.800]  We need an area we can control the VPD, the temperature and the humidity is what that
[16:34.800 --> 16:36.080]  boils down to.
[16:36.080 --> 16:38.920]  Somewhere we can evacuate the air and replace the air.
[16:38.920 --> 16:42.440]  Somewhere we can get some airflow in there and then something we can put lights in and
[16:42.440 --> 16:44.820]  not burn our plants and melt our environment.
[16:44.820 --> 16:48.200]  If you're going to build a little tiny grow space, please be safe.
[16:48.200 --> 16:53.000]  I've seen people build little dressers and light shit on fire because they put too much
[16:53.000 --> 16:54.680]  light inside of there.
[16:54.680 --> 16:56.760]  Don't put too much light in your grow space.
[16:56.760 --> 16:57.760]  Be careful.
[16:57.760 --> 17:02.080]  And that mylar, if it touches the light, eventually that shit will catch on fire and burn.
[17:02.080 --> 17:04.120]  So make sure the mylar is stuck to the wall as well.
[17:04.120 --> 17:05.120]  I don't even like mylar.
[17:05.120 --> 17:06.360]  I use Panda film.
[17:06.360 --> 17:07.800]  That shit will melt if it touches the light.
[17:07.800 --> 17:09.960]  So be very careful with that stuff.
[17:09.960 --> 17:14.800]  But what you need for three plants is basically up to your goal.
[17:14.800 --> 17:19.280]  Most people probably have room for a three by three or a five by five grow tent in their
[17:19.280 --> 17:20.280]  home.
[17:20.280 --> 17:25.440]  I would highly recommend a three by three or a five by five grow tent with Canon LED
[17:25.440 --> 17:26.440]  lighting.
[17:26.440 --> 17:28.080]  My office doesn't pay me to say that.
[17:28.080 --> 17:30.000]  I've got Canon LEDs.
[17:30.000 --> 17:34.360]  I've got Canon LEDs in a three by three gorilla grow tent.
[17:34.360 --> 17:36.560]  That is where I keep my small veg stuff sometimes.
[17:36.560 --> 17:39.840]  It's where I honestly keep my male plants most of the time.
[17:39.840 --> 17:45.240]  Those plants, excuse me, those plants in that three by three with that one Canon LED are
[17:45.240 --> 17:46.680]  extremely happy.
[17:46.680 --> 17:48.080]  Anybody can get that grow going.
[17:48.080 --> 17:50.720]  It's a three by three tent, a Canon LED.
[17:50.720 --> 17:52.160]  I've got a carbon filter.
[17:52.160 --> 17:54.280]  I've got a, is it a four or a six inch blower?
[17:54.280 --> 17:57.600]  I've got a small blower in there sucking the stagnant air out.
[17:57.600 --> 18:01.520]  And then that just ducks out of a window because oftentimes I put a male plant in there and
[18:01.520 --> 18:05.200]  I want that a carbon filter and that exhaust going directly out.
[18:05.200 --> 18:06.680]  So there's no pollen contamination.
[18:06.680 --> 18:08.240]  The pollen is going directly away.
[18:08.240 --> 18:12.440]  I'm sorry if you grow in my backyard, you're going to get pollinated possibly.
[18:12.440 --> 18:15.800]  Let me catch up on my notes and see where we are here.
[18:15.800 --> 18:17.680]  It's all about how big of a plant you want.
[18:17.680 --> 18:19.960]  If you veg them for two weeks, they'll be this tall.
[18:19.960 --> 18:23.120]  If you veg them for six months, there'll be gigantic plants.
[18:23.160 --> 18:26.880]  So you can build a gigantic enclosure for three plants or you can have a little teeny
[18:26.880 --> 18:29.040]  tiny space for three plants.
[18:29.040 --> 18:33.120]  It's all about your goal, your desires, what you're trying to do.
[18:33.120 --> 18:38.000]  I was talking about putting a hundred or 120 Rockwell cubes under one led.
[18:38.000 --> 18:42.120]  Then all you have to do is veg those for like a week or like 10 days or so and they're this
[18:42.120 --> 18:43.840]  tall ish, ish.
[18:43.840 --> 18:46.960]  And then you flower them and you could pull seven to 12 grams per plant.
[18:46.960 --> 18:52.240]  And if you do a hundred plants times seven to 12 grams, you're getting 700 to 1200 grams
[18:52.240 --> 18:53.240]  of herb at the end, right?
[18:53.240 --> 18:58.080]  If you do it correctly, that works out pretty well in my opinion, but that many plants is
[18:58.080 --> 18:59.080]  illegal.
[18:59.080 --> 19:03.760]  So we go bigger plants, trellis them out, spread them out, maximize our space.
[19:03.760 --> 19:06.320]  It's all about maximizing the space you've got and having a goal.
[19:06.320 --> 19:09.280]  So I don't know how much space you need for your three plants.
[19:09.280 --> 19:10.280]  What's your goal?
[19:10.280 --> 19:16.280]  I'm going to start by recommending that three by three grow tent with a Canon led, a carbon
[19:16.280 --> 19:19.240]  filter and a blower and put a fan inside of there.
[19:19.240 --> 19:22.920]  And that should have you set up to rock pretty good for a starter kit.
[19:22.920 --> 19:25.560]  Maybe go five by five with two or three cannons.
[19:25.560 --> 19:27.200]  Then expand as time goes on.
[19:27.200 --> 19:31.780]  Add more tents out of veg tent, have a flower, have one in veg, one in flower or two in flower
[19:31.780 --> 19:33.000]  all the time.
[19:33.000 --> 19:34.340]  That's a way to expand on that.
[19:34.340 --> 19:37.040]  But yeah, three plants.
[19:37.040 --> 19:38.040]  It's all about your goal.
[19:38.040 --> 19:41.840]  I wish I could give you a direct do this, do this, but I would say get that three by
[19:41.840 --> 19:46.040]  three tent, put the Canon led in there, get that set up and learn to grow that way.
[19:46.040 --> 19:47.400]  Then expand.
[19:47.400 --> 19:51.720]  Getting smaller is going to be kind of hard to control the VPD constantly.
[19:51.720 --> 19:55.480]  Also you need a hygrometer and a thermometer, something that will tell you the temperature
[19:55.480 --> 19:56.680]  and humidity in that space.
[19:56.680 --> 19:59.400]  You can look at it all the time and see what's going on in there and make adjustments as
[19:59.400 --> 20:00.480]  necessary.
[20:00.480 --> 20:02.400]  So what do I need to grow three plants?
[20:02.400 --> 20:03.720]  You need a sealable environment.
[20:03.720 --> 20:08.360]  You can seal the light, you can control the airflow, you can control the vapor pressure
[20:08.360 --> 20:13.120]  deficit, you can control who goes in and out of their secure area, somewhere that's clean,
[20:13.120 --> 20:17.200]  somewhere that you can control the bugs and the predators and the insects.
[20:17.200 --> 20:21.720]  I said that with bugs, with the, uh, the little rodents and fucking animals, traffic, something
[20:21.720 --> 20:22.720]  you can control.
[20:22.720 --> 20:26.960]  All of that is mainly what you need, a clean workspace, anything else you can turn it into
[20:26.960 --> 20:28.600]  a grow environment.
[20:28.600 --> 20:29.600]  It's all up to you.
[20:29.600 --> 20:31.560]  Everything is adjustable depending on your goals.
[20:31.560 --> 20:33.440]  That's one of the best parts about growing.
[20:33.440 --> 20:36.880]  There are no real, uh, you've got to do it this way.
[20:36.880 --> 20:37.880]  Kind of rules.
[20:37.880 --> 20:39.380]  People will say, you'll see it in groups.
[20:39.380 --> 20:41.720]  You need to talk that plant now, or you need to do this now.
[20:41.720 --> 20:44.400]  And I always say, why explain why?
[20:44.400 --> 20:46.740]  Give me a paragraph of why that needs to happen.
[20:46.740 --> 20:48.040]  You could do it however you want.
[20:48.040 --> 20:51.640]  As long as you are happy with the way the plants come out in the end, uh, you're doing
[20:51.640 --> 20:52.640]  it right.
[20:52.640 --> 20:54.640]  Uh, you're always going to find room for improvement.
[20:54.640 --> 20:59.680]  If you get raided or kill the plants or flood the room, you might've done something wrong,
[20:59.680 --> 21:01.680]  but we can recover from most of that.
[21:01.680 --> 21:02.680]  All right.
[21:02.680 --> 21:03.680]  I think I answered that one.
[21:03.680 --> 21:05.720]  I think I rambled on for quite a bit.
[21:05.720 --> 21:11.700]  Um, another note that I wrote was don't let anybody else mess up your goal.
[21:11.700 --> 21:12.700]  And your strategy.
[21:12.700 --> 21:16.980]  Uh, if you want to grow your three plants, your way, you grow your three plants, your
[21:16.980 --> 21:17.980]  way.
[21:17.980 --> 21:20.940]  Some people just have to learn by doing shit the way they do shit.
[21:20.940 --> 21:24.100]  If you did it the wrong way, you're going to find out if you did it the right way, you're
[21:24.100 --> 21:25.820]  going to find out.
[21:25.820 --> 21:30.980]  Then the first time you grow, you'll say, I, my idea was just not fucking right.
[21:30.980 --> 21:32.260]  This was a half cooked idea.
[21:32.260 --> 21:35.420]  And now I see why everybody on the internet said that I was goofy for trying this, but
[21:35.420 --> 21:37.600]  guess what you learned and you got to see it.
[21:37.600 --> 21:42.120]  So don't let anybody mess up your strategy or your goals or your ideas.
[21:42.120 --> 21:43.120]  Even me.
[21:43.120 --> 21:47.720]  Uh, I'm an experienced grower, but, uh, you might have an idea that I've never thought
[21:47.720 --> 21:48.720]  of.
[21:48.720 --> 21:49.720]  I learned from everybody.
[21:49.720 --> 21:54.480]  I can learn something from everybody, from a grower who's doing his first day to a grower
[21:54.480 --> 21:56.320]  who's been there for a hundred years.
[21:56.320 --> 21:57.960]  I can learn something from everybody.
[21:57.960 --> 22:02.280]  I learned that in the music industry, I can learn something from everybody on a drum kit.
[22:02.280 --> 22:03.960]  Same thing goes for the grow room.
[22:03.960 --> 22:07.920]  So don't let me mess up your plans, your ideas, and your goals.
[22:07.920 --> 22:13.480]  Let my knowledge and my experience and my info, uh, have some effect on your ideas,
[22:13.480 --> 22:15.280]  but don't let me make decisions for you.
[22:15.280 --> 22:16.280]  You know what I mean?
[22:16.280 --> 22:20.360]  Like use my input as data and then weigh your options with the data that you've been given.
[22:20.360 --> 22:23.320]  But don't don't, you don't have to follow me as gospel.
[22:23.320 --> 22:24.320]  Sometimes I don't know.
[22:24.320 --> 22:26.720]  A lot of times I don't know what is happening in your grow.
[22:26.720 --> 22:31.200]  I don't know the exact specific environment, the situation, the thing.
[22:31.200 --> 22:34.160]  So, uh, maybe, uh, maybe I'm wrong.
[22:34.160 --> 22:39.360]  And a lot of my ideas are expensive and people say to solve that problem, you just gave me
[22:39.360 --> 22:41.960]  a $500 solution.
[22:41.960 --> 22:43.480]  And sometimes that's, what's going to fix it.
[22:43.480 --> 22:46.840]  Our grow rooms and our plants are, they require certain things.
[22:46.840 --> 22:50.160]  And if you want to cheap out and do shit the cheap way you really can, but you're going
[22:50.160 --> 22:51.560]  to get the cheap outcome.
[22:51.560 --> 22:58.000]  Um, I run my grows like a business when there's a harvest, there is a profit obviously.
[22:58.000 --> 23:01.920]  And then that profit goes into the bank because it's ran like a business.
[23:01.920 --> 23:05.520]  And then a portion of that profit is put back into the business.
[23:05.520 --> 23:07.600]  You've got to buy a new carbon filter.
[23:07.600 --> 23:08.840]  You've got to buy new lights.
[23:08.840 --> 23:11.760]  You've got to buy maybe a new pH pan.
[23:11.760 --> 23:15.780]  You definitely need more nutrients, new soil, probably some new pots.
[23:15.780 --> 23:17.600]  You got to pay somebody to help you packaging.
[23:17.600 --> 23:18.600]  You got to pay somebody.
[23:18.600 --> 23:20.680]  If you trim it, they're going to get paid for trimming it.
[23:20.680 --> 23:23.360]  So it all gets invested back into the business.
[23:23.360 --> 23:25.880]  Then as a seed maker, I buy seed packaging.
[23:26.200 --> 23:30.280]  Uh, there's a lot of components to my seed packaging and then there are shipping components,
[23:30.280 --> 23:31.280]  a lot of that stuff.
[23:31.280 --> 23:33.400]  So it all gets reinvested back into the business.
[23:33.400 --> 23:36.480]  So don't be afraid to invest in your business.
[23:36.480 --> 23:41.360]  You're growing a product that's going to give you a reward, whether it's medically, whether
[23:41.360 --> 23:45.120]  it's recreationally, whether it's financially, there will be a reward.
[23:45.120 --> 23:46.120]  This is a business.
[23:46.120 --> 23:50.080]  You've got to put something into it to get something out of it, or you don't get shit
[23:50.080 --> 23:51.080]  out of it.
[23:51.080 --> 23:54.660]  It will show you everything you put into your grow will come back to you.
[23:54.660 --> 23:59.780]  If you put in laziness, your end product, your photos on Instagram will show they will
[23:59.780 --> 24:01.380]  convey laziness.
[24:01.380 --> 24:06.660]  If you put love, effort, energy, pride, passion into your grow, your flowers and your photos
[24:06.660 --> 24:12.460]  will show that even if you're not growing the most amazing product, the fucking 32%
[24:12.460 --> 24:16.980]  that everybody's wanting to snap pictures of, you'll still feel, still feel pride in
[24:16.980 --> 24:20.380]  that product and you'll learn how to improve it because your ego is not in the way you're
[24:20.380 --> 24:25.580]  growing from your heart, not from your wallet, not from knowing about the profit, but put
[24:25.580 --> 24:27.260]  some pride into your garden.
[24:27.260 --> 24:28.380]  Reinvest in the garden.
[24:28.380 --> 24:32.000]  Understand that you've got to reinvest in this business and it will keep reinvesting
[24:32.000 --> 24:33.700]  in you when you smoke that pro.
[24:33.700 --> 24:35.940]  You want it to be not stressful.
[24:35.940 --> 24:38.060]  You want it to be enjoyable.
[24:38.060 --> 24:42.780]  And something I've noticed is when I worked at, I use guitar center as a reference a lot,
[24:42.780 --> 24:44.920]  but this will make a lot of sense.
[24:44.920 --> 24:49.660]  When I would sell a little kid a shitty guitar or a shitty drum set, he'd come back in a
[24:49.660 --> 24:53.200]  couple of weeks looking for something to add to it to make it fun again because he
[24:53.200 --> 24:58.180]  ran out of fun because the guitar or the drums, no matter how well you play them and tune
[24:58.180 --> 25:02.820]  them, they're going to sound like shit because they are cheap, shitty quality instruments.
[25:02.820 --> 25:04.300]  They're not going to sound good.
[25:04.300 --> 25:08.460]  They were just made to sell, to get money in the bank, to make it look like a guitar,
[25:08.460 --> 25:10.060]  to take little kid money.
[25:10.060 --> 25:12.860]  If that little kid would have invested, I know it's his parents and I'm not blaming
[25:12.860 --> 25:14.700]  anybody, but this is how it goes.
[25:14.700 --> 25:18.540]  If the parent would have invested in a high quality instrument in the beginning, they
[25:18.540 --> 25:21.420]  would have gone home and had a chance to sound good.
[25:21.420 --> 25:25.260]  You're never going to, some, some pro musicians are going to grab some shit gear and say,
[25:25.260 --> 25:26.260]  watch this bro.
[25:26.260 --> 25:27.260]  Cause I can do it.
[25:27.260 --> 25:28.700]  I'll make a shitty drum set sound good, but I've got skills.
[25:28.700 --> 25:32.980]  Now a beginner drummer is never going to make a shitty drum set sound like a rockstar drum
[25:32.980 --> 25:33.980]  set.
[25:33.980 --> 25:36.260]  You got to get them a good drum set to sound good.
[25:36.260 --> 25:37.980]  I feel the same way with grow gear.
[25:37.980 --> 25:41.700]  If you buy the cheapest light, you can get the cheapest soil.
[25:41.700 --> 25:44.220]  You can find the cheapest genetics you can get.
[25:44.220 --> 25:47.620]  You're not going to have a good grow because you've got a bunch of cheap shit to work with
[25:47.700 --> 25:49.860]  and it's always going to be a struggle.
[25:49.860 --> 25:51.400]  Something is going to be wrong.
[25:51.400 --> 25:52.980]  The plants aren't getting enough light.
[25:52.980 --> 25:54.500]  They're not getting the right spectrum.
[25:54.500 --> 25:56.020]  So they're going to grow wonky.
[25:56.020 --> 25:57.400]  Then you got shitty soil on there.
[25:57.400 --> 25:59.340]  So they don't even have a chance to develop healthy roots.
[25:59.340 --> 26:00.340]  They're going, this soil sucks.
[26:00.340 --> 26:01.820]  I don't know what to do.
[26:01.820 --> 26:05.500]  And then you're, you got shitty genetics to begin with and they're never going to perform.
[26:05.500 --> 26:06.700]  That's like buying a shitty guitar.
[26:06.700 --> 26:08.100]  It's never going to sound good.
[26:08.100 --> 26:11.420]  No matter how many fucking pedals you run it through, no matter how much compression
[26:11.420 --> 26:15.660]  you put on it, no matter how many books you read, how many YouTube videos you watch, that
[26:15.660 --> 26:21.540]  shitty Laguna guitar is always going to sound like a shitty Laguna guitar that the fucking
[26:21.540 --> 26:22.780]  neck is going to bend.
[26:22.780 --> 26:24.060]  It's never going to work right.
[26:24.060 --> 26:26.980]  And that's how it's going to be if you buy shitty gear for the garden.
[26:26.980 --> 26:30.620]  So invest in yourself, invest in your garden and have a good time in there.
[26:30.620 --> 26:32.620]  Make it fun, make it enjoyable.
[26:32.620 --> 26:35.220]  And people are saying Rasta Jeff, I don't have the money to do that.
[26:35.220 --> 26:36.540]  Maybe not yet.
[26:36.540 --> 26:39.140]  Maybe you can't do that on your first grow, your second grow.
[26:39.140 --> 26:43.740]  But if you're growing now, you're saving money buying from the plug or the dispensary.
[26:43.740 --> 26:46.620]  That's that much money you're not spending there.
[26:46.620 --> 26:48.780]  Then you've got that extra fundage.
[26:48.780 --> 26:52.980]  You're not spending the money or maybe you are putting it out on the black market and
[26:52.980 --> 26:54.100]  making a profit.
[26:54.100 --> 26:58.300]  Therefore, you should be reinvesting in the grow because if you're growing black market,
[26:58.300 --> 26:59.420]  it's a competitive market.
[26:59.420 --> 27:00.420]  You've got to keep up.
[27:00.420 --> 27:01.540]  You want to be top shelf.
[27:01.540 --> 27:06.660]  You want to be the best grower with the best product and the most of it readily available.
[27:06.660 --> 27:08.420]  So that's when you're going to want to step up your game.
[27:08.420 --> 27:12.580]  If you're going black market, you definitely need to get the best you can as quick as possible
[27:12.780 --> 27:16.100]  because the guy down the block is working too and he's watching my show also.
[27:16.100 --> 27:18.260]  He's going that motherfucker, I got to get better than him.
[27:18.260 --> 27:19.780]  So you guys are competing.
[27:19.780 --> 27:20.780]  Step your shit up.
[27:20.780 --> 27:22.700]  Put some passion into it.
[27:22.700 --> 27:25.780]  Reinvest that cheap shit is going to break you guys in the middle of the grow.
[27:25.780 --> 27:27.780]  That cheap LED is going to start going.
[27:27.780 --> 27:31.980]  And then you're going to walk in there and it's going to be flickering and flashing.
[27:31.980 --> 27:33.780]  You're going to go, what is wrong with my light?
[27:33.780 --> 27:37.380]  And you're going to call the company and they're going to be in China and nobody's going to
[27:37.380 --> 27:39.100]  answer and now you don't have a grow light.
[27:39.100 --> 27:40.100]  You got to buy a new one.
[27:40.100 --> 27:41.100]  But guess what?
[27:41.100 --> 27:43.220]  If you bought a good grow light in America, you bought a good grow light from, I'm not
[27:43.220 --> 27:46.220]  saying that all the Chinese companies are bad, but if you got a good company that was
[27:46.220 --> 27:48.100]  locally based in America, you call them up.
[27:48.100 --> 27:49.100]  Say I got problems.
[27:49.100 --> 27:51.060]  I'll either talk you through it or help you get a replacement.
[27:51.060 --> 27:52.540]  You're not shit out of luck.
[27:52.540 --> 27:54.740]  So buy good gear, cheap shit breaks.
[27:54.740 --> 28:00.900]  I often see people asking what is the best cheap pH pen I can buy.
[28:00.900 --> 28:03.380]  Those two words are never going to be together.
[28:03.380 --> 28:04.380]  Best and cheap.
[28:04.380 --> 28:07.220]  There's a reason why best is the best and cheap is the cheap.
[28:07.220 --> 28:09.460]  Those two things don't ever fall together.
[28:09.460 --> 28:10.540]  The best isn't the cheapest.
[28:10.540 --> 28:11.820]  The cheapest isn't the best.
[28:11.820 --> 28:14.460]  That's there's fucking economy and logic.
[28:14.460 --> 28:15.460]  There's a reason why.
[28:15.460 --> 28:19.300]  But if you need a pH pen, I always recommend getting a blue lab or something better than
[28:19.300 --> 28:20.300]  a blue lab.
[28:20.300 --> 28:22.560]  I like the blue lab three in one combo meters.
[28:22.560 --> 28:24.900]  Get the blue lab stuff because it works.
[28:24.900 --> 28:28.860]  All the other meters that I've tried, they don't hold the calibration long.
[28:28.860 --> 28:29.860]  They die.
[28:29.860 --> 28:31.620]  They basically, I just say they suck, bro.
[28:31.620 --> 28:32.660]  Get the blue labs.
[28:32.660 --> 28:33.660]  That's what I recommend.
[28:33.660 --> 28:36.660]  But cheap and best will never be the same.
[28:36.660 --> 28:37.660]  All right.
[28:37.660 --> 28:38.660]  Where are we in all of my notes?
[28:38.860 --> 28:39.860]  I got a lot of notes here.
[28:39.860 --> 28:41.460]  We may have to skip some of this stuff.
[28:41.460 --> 28:42.460]  Yeah.
[28:42.460 --> 28:43.900]  Don't buy that knockoff stuff.
[28:43.900 --> 28:48.660]  I see people buy like knockoff lights or knockoff stuff and then complain that it didn't work
[28:48.660 --> 28:49.660]  as good as it should have.
[28:49.660 --> 28:50.820]  You bought the knockoff shit, bro.
[28:50.820 --> 28:54.660]  Spend the real money, get the real thing, and then you'll see that quality products,
[28:54.660 --> 28:58.860]  a quality high-end luxury product will make your grow experience much better.
[28:58.860 --> 29:00.820]  Just be more comfortable, more excited.
[29:00.820 --> 29:02.860]  It won't be as stressful.
[29:02.860 --> 29:04.660]  It's just easier when shit works.
[29:04.660 --> 29:05.660]  All right.
[29:05.660 --> 29:07.780]  I think that is all I've got for you for this episode.
[29:07.780 --> 29:11.900]  I think I've gone for about 30 minutes minus a couple of quick edits that you probably
[29:11.900 --> 29:12.900]  didn't even notice.
[29:12.900 --> 29:13.900]  Yeah.
[29:13.900 --> 29:15.780]  I'm going to wind up this episode.
[29:15.780 --> 29:18.460]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[29:18.460 --> 29:22.220]  If you've got any edits, questions, corrections, comments, or concerns, I'd love to hear from

[29:26.220 --> 29:27.220]  Don't make fun of me.
[29:27.220 --> 29:29.980]  It's an old school email address and it works.
