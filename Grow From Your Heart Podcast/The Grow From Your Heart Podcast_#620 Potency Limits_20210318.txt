[00:00.000 --> 00:06.530]  All right, here we go.
[00:06.530 --> 00:07.530]  Welcome back podcast world.
[00:07.530 --> 00:08.530]  I'm your host.
[00:08.530 --> 00:09.530]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:09.530 --> 00:12.530]  Joining me today on camera is my buddy, White Mike.
[00:12.530 --> 00:13.530]  Welcome to the show, bro.
[00:13.530 --> 00:14.530]  What's up, man?
[00:14.530 --> 00:15.530]  How you doing, everybody?
[00:15.530 --> 00:16.530]  Thanks for joining us, Mike.
[00:16.530 --> 00:21.010]  Thanks for getting some time away from the families or setting up the cool backdrop there.
[00:21.010 --> 00:22.010]  Set up the microphone.
[00:22.010 --> 00:23.210]  It's good to have you back on the show.
[00:23.210 --> 00:27.010]  A lot of people have been asking for you, so they're going to be excited to see you.
[00:27.010 --> 00:28.650]  Glad to be back.
[00:28.650 --> 00:29.650]  Glad to have you.
[00:29.650 --> 00:30.650]  This is episode number 620.
[00:31.410 --> 00:33.410]  I'm going to try to remember to look into the camera.
[00:33.410 --> 00:35.330]  I've got Mike on the Zoom here on this screen.
[00:35.330 --> 00:36.330]  I've got the camera up there.
[00:36.330 --> 00:37.970]  I'm going to try to do my best to look into the camera.
[00:37.970 --> 00:38.970]  I apologize if I forget.
[00:38.970 --> 00:42.490]  I'm trying to pay attention to my buddy here, trying to host a show, trying to look at a
[00:42.490 --> 00:44.010]  camera, trying to read notes.
[00:44.010 --> 00:47.130]  And also, I'm high as giraffe pussy, so I got a lot of things going on, but we will
[00:47.130 --> 00:48.130]  make this happen.
[00:48.130 --> 00:49.410]  Thank you for joining me, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49.410 --> 00:51.490]  Episode 620, White Mike is here.
[00:51.490 --> 00:57.890]  In this episode, we're going to talk about a proposed potency limit on Colorado cannabis.
[00:57.890 --> 01:00.730]  This is a hot topic for myself and for Mike.
[01:00.730 --> 01:01.730]  We're going to jump into that.
[01:01.730 --> 01:03.570]  But first, we got to do what we normally do.
[01:03.570 --> 01:07.650]  Let's do some shout outs to a few of the great folks who support us on Patreon.
[01:07.650 --> 01:10.130]  I'm going to start off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:10.130 --> 01:11.130]  Thank you.
[01:11.130 --> 01:12.130]  Shout out to my buddy, Thomas McGinnis.
[01:12.130 --> 01:15.050]  Let's send a big shout out to Rill Raw.
[01:15.050 --> 01:19.050]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Billy Podunk, who is also the Discord champ.
[01:19.050 --> 01:22.170]  If Discord was a game, Billy Podunk is winning.
[01:22.170 --> 01:23.290]  Big shout out to that dude.
[01:23.290 --> 01:24.450]  Always on the Discord channel.
[01:24.450 --> 01:25.650]  Drop in, say hello.
[01:25.650 --> 01:28.330]  There will be a link to the Discord in the show notes.
[01:28.330 --> 01:30.810]  Let's continue with a shout out to Bongstein Bear.
[01:30.810 --> 01:32.130]  I love that name.
[01:32.130 --> 01:35.210]  Let's send a shout out to EZ057, big fist bump brother.
[01:35.210 --> 01:37.730]  Let's send a thank you shout out to my buddy, Alabama Man.
[01:37.730 --> 01:41.010]  Let's send a special thank you to Glenn Gironi and Gramps Memel.
[01:41.010 --> 01:43.650]  Let's send a thank you to Single T and Dank Grows.
[01:43.650 --> 01:45.290]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Noah N.
[01:45.290 --> 01:47.370]  And let's wrap up the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:47.370 --> 01:51.770]  Thank you shout outs with a big thank you shout out to my buddy, Riven Waters.
[01:51.770 --> 01:55.250]  Big thanks and big shout out to all my friends who support my show on Patreon.
[01:55.250 --> 01:58.890]  Of course, you can find us at patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[01:58.890 --> 02:00.370]  There is a link in the show notes.
[02:00.370 --> 02:04.850]  I feel like it is a polite and important now that I give Mike an opportunity
[02:04.850 --> 02:07.090]  to do some Patreon shout outs.
[02:07.090 --> 02:08.530]  So Mike, it is all yours, buddy.
[02:08.530 --> 02:10.290]  Go ahead and spread some love.
[02:10.290 --> 02:11.490]  Thanks, bro.
[02:11.490 --> 02:14.490]  I want to give a shout out to the Grow From The Heart podcast
[02:14.490 --> 02:16.250]  for always supporting me.
[02:16.250 --> 02:18.370]  OG Purple Thumb, thank you very much.
[02:18.370 --> 02:21.490]  Learnin' and Burnin', Chris, Farmer Z.
[02:21.490 --> 02:24.090]  Thank you all so very much for supporting me.
[02:24.130 --> 02:27.170]  And yeah, we wouldn't be here without you.
[02:27.170 --> 02:29.890]  Well, we might be, but the show would not look this good.
[02:29.890 --> 02:30.410]  That's the truth.
[02:30.410 --> 02:33.090]  I would still do it even without him, but we wouldn't have the cool gear
[02:33.090 --> 02:34.530]  and all that fanciness happenin'.
[02:34.530 --> 02:36.010]  It'd still look all rickety.
[02:36.010 --> 02:38.130]  A special shout out to our buddy, OG Purple Thumb.
[02:38.130 --> 02:41.170]  He supports iReed Genetics in many, many ways.
[02:41.170 --> 02:44.170]  All things Rasta Jeff, Grow From Your Heart, iReed Genetics.
[02:44.170 --> 02:47.890]  OG Purple Thumb has got my back, so it's good to see that he is supporting you as well.
[02:47.890 --> 02:48.410]  Thank you, bro.
[02:48.410 --> 02:51.010]  I do appreciate you helpin' out my crew, my buddies.
[02:51.010 --> 02:52.970]  This is a great community we've got here.
[02:52.970 --> 02:55.810]  Mike didn't shout it out, but make sure you give Mike a Patreon click
[02:55.810 --> 02:59.330]  at patreon.com forward slash white Mike.
[02:59.330 --> 03:01.650]  Super easy to remember.
[03:01.650 --> 03:04.570]  I think that's all the business stuff we've got here at the top of the show.
[03:04.570 --> 03:05.770]  We did the Patreon shout outs.
[03:05.770 --> 03:06.970]  I welcome to Mike.
[03:06.970 --> 03:09.930]  Mike, just in case people do wanna stalk you while they're listening to the show,
[03:09.930 --> 03:12.410]  is there anywhere they can find you on the social media?
[03:12.410 --> 03:15.770]  You can find me on Twitter at at Nemo Punk 15.
[03:15.770 --> 03:19.890]  You can find me on Facebook at Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[03:19.890 --> 03:20.770]  There we go, you guys.
[03:20.770 --> 03:21.450]  Give him a follow.
[03:21.450 --> 03:22.330]  Follow my buddy.
[03:22.330 --> 03:25.730]  Stalk him, harass him, give him some feedback.
[03:25.730 --> 03:29.050]  Also, all things that Mike says are opinions of Mike.
[03:29.050 --> 03:30.370]  Don't send me the emails, huh?
[03:30.370 --> 03:31.770]  You gotta send me the hate mail.
[03:31.770 --> 03:33.770]  I always say that and then I never get it.
[03:33.770 --> 03:34.850]  Poor Jeff does.
[03:34.850 --> 03:35.970]  Where should they send that hate mail?
[03:35.970 --> 03:37.930]  Or the great emails.
[03:37.930 --> 03:41.210]  Where should they send you the updates and the greetings, Mike?
[03:41.210 --> 03:42.570]  Just hit me up on social media.
[03:42.570 --> 03:44.690]  You can direct message either of those accounts.
[03:44.690 --> 03:45.130]  There you go.
[03:45.130 --> 03:45.970]  Direct message.
[03:45.970 --> 03:47.050]  Send him a DM.
[03:47.050 --> 03:47.770]  Be nice to Mike.
[03:47.770 --> 03:49.930]  He volunteers to do this for free.
[03:49.930 --> 03:51.570]  He deals with two kids and a wife all day.
[03:51.610 --> 03:52.930]  This is his getaway.
[03:52.930 --> 03:55.210]  Please be nice to my friend.
[03:55.210 --> 03:57.570]  I don't think we want to jump into too much more else.
[03:57.570 --> 04:02.250]  I think we could probably jump right into the main topic of today's show.
[04:02.250 --> 04:04.930]  People are going to notice that you've got a boo-boo on your fingers
[04:04.930 --> 04:06.770]  if you've moved that hand towards the camera.
[04:06.770 --> 04:09.570]  I actually took the boo-boo off to hide the boo-boo.
[04:09.570 --> 04:10.370]  Oh, OK.
[04:10.370 --> 04:12.250]  I'll put that back on now that you've added it.
[04:12.250 --> 04:13.850]  I didn't want to make it a topic of the show.
[04:13.850 --> 04:14.450]  Oh, no, I was just going to say.
[04:14.450 --> 04:15.850]  Yeah, I broke a finger.
[04:15.850 --> 04:16.370]  I took it off.
[04:16.370 --> 04:17.090]  Yeah, Mike's got a boo-boo.
[04:17.090 --> 04:17.770]  He broke a finger.
[04:17.770 --> 04:18.930]  It was a dog thing.
[04:18.930 --> 04:21.130]  We've addressed it and we've told him why.
[04:21.410 --> 04:23.530]  I tried to keep a dog from getting hurt.
[04:23.530 --> 04:24.770]  The dog didn't bite me or nothing.
[04:24.770 --> 04:25.570]  Everybody's OK.
[04:25.570 --> 04:26.530]  Shout out to Rufus.
[04:26.530 --> 04:27.450]  You're a good boy.
[04:27.450 --> 04:29.130]  Shout out to Mike for rescuing Rufus.
[04:29.130 --> 04:29.810]  Good work, bro.
[04:29.810 --> 04:30.810]  I would have done the same thing.
[04:30.810 --> 04:32.690]  I would have had a broken finger, too, if I were in the situation.
[04:32.690 --> 04:33.770]  I think you did the right thing.
[04:33.770 --> 04:36.690]  So, yeah, I literally thought, don't do it.
[04:36.690 --> 04:39.210]  You're going to break your finger right before I broke my finger.
[04:39.210 --> 04:43.290]  So, listeners, if you ever think, don't do that, you're going to break a finger.
[04:43.530 --> 04:46.650]  I advise you to not do that because you're probably going to break your finger.
[04:46.970 --> 04:50.010]  Now, if you gave me the option of break a finger or somebody's dog
[04:50.010 --> 04:52.770]  get hit by a car, I'll sacrifice my finger for almost for sure.
[04:52.810 --> 04:54.450]  Dog, just, you know, I'm just now.
[04:54.450 --> 04:55.330]  So you did the right thing.
[04:55.330 --> 04:56.970]  I would have still reach out and help the dog.
[04:56.970 --> 04:58.530]  You guys help the dog get your finger busted.
[04:58.570 --> 04:59.250]  That's your man.
[04:59.250 --> 05:00.410]  Your finger will heal.
[05:00.410 --> 05:01.770]  Maybe the dog would have gotten hurt worse.
[05:01.770 --> 05:02.810]  I don't know. Mike's a big dude.
[05:02.810 --> 05:03.450]  He can deal with that.
[05:03.450 --> 05:04.930]  The fucking pinky will be OK.
[05:04.930 --> 05:07.410]  Anyway, I just want to say it's amusing and annoying.
[05:07.410 --> 05:10.250]  It's just it gets to be amusing and annoying for like six weeks.
[05:10.450 --> 05:13.530]  Yeah. What I've noticed about YouTube is if there is a thing,
[05:13.650 --> 05:15.010]  somebody will address it.
[05:15.010 --> 05:16.450]  And if we don't, they will.
[05:16.450 --> 05:18.610]  And now we don't have to answer the comments because we already did.
[05:19.610 --> 05:21.690]  That's just how social media and the Internet work now, Mike.
[05:21.690 --> 05:23.730]  I've been doing this for way too long, I guess.
[05:23.730 --> 05:25.850]  Is it jaded or programmed or just aware?
[05:25.850 --> 05:28.330]  Which one am I? Professional experienced.
[05:28.370 --> 05:31.570]  I like that. OK, speaking of professional and experience,
[05:31.570 --> 05:33.090]  we do have a podcast. I do have notes.
[05:33.090 --> 05:34.930]  We do have some shit to talk about.
[05:34.930 --> 05:39.450]  You've got a topic, you know, a topic with I've got like four, one, two, three.
[05:39.450 --> 05:43.490]  If I got five little bullet points here, actually the tabs open.
[05:43.690 --> 05:45.810]  Wow. Mike's doing it real hard.
[05:45.810 --> 05:47.930]  Let's keep this going before we ruin the appearance.
[05:48.570 --> 05:51.890]  I told me they love it when we ramble.
[05:51.890 --> 05:53.010]  They sure do use hashtag.
[05:53.010 --> 05:55.170]  They like it when we ramble, when you talk about the podcast,
[05:55.170 --> 05:56.450]  that helps us find the show.
[05:56.450 --> 05:59.010]  So Mike's taking a rip off that.
[05:59.010 --> 06:00.490]  Maybe I can get this out now.
[06:00.490 --> 06:04.850]  Mike has told me recently that there are proposed potency limits
[06:04.850 --> 06:09.970]  in Colorado for cannabis and concentrates and possibly edibles.
[06:09.970 --> 06:11.210]  I didn't ask that far.
[06:11.210 --> 06:15.850]  I also failed to ask if this was for recreational or for medical cannabis.
[06:15.850 --> 06:18.090]  But I figured that would be a great topic for the show.
[06:18.090 --> 06:19.290]  I didn't ask a lot of questions.
[06:19.290 --> 06:21.250]  I wanted to save it all here and be fresh.
[06:21.250 --> 06:23.010]  I didn't want to blow it all in the hallway.
[06:23.010 --> 06:25.490]  So let's talk about this, Mike.
[06:25.690 --> 06:30.010]  They are proposing making potency limits on cannabis here in Colorado.
[06:30.010 --> 06:33.650]  My first question, of course, is this medical or recreational cannabis
[06:33.650 --> 06:35.170]  that they're trying to mess with here?
[06:35.170 --> 06:38.770]  The proposed bill would affect both bed and rec.
[06:39.850 --> 06:45.210]  So both right now, this is just in Colorado,
[06:45.210 --> 06:47.530]  but the people behind it are national
[06:48.650 --> 06:53.570]  or at least connected to a network of national anti-cannabis organizations.
[06:54.050 --> 06:56.130]  Organization. It's one national org.
[06:58.170 --> 07:03.010]  And then each one of their members runs and their own little state group.
[07:03.010 --> 07:06.570]  And it's usually just five or six annoying parents
[07:06.570 --> 07:09.250]  working together in concert on social media.
[07:09.250 --> 07:13.850]  But over the last nine years,
[07:13.850 --> 07:17.610]  they've slowly built a foothold of support
[07:18.090 --> 07:21.050]  in state legislatures, including Colorado's.
[07:21.690 --> 07:25.490]  So right now in Colorado.
[07:25.490 --> 07:27.890]  Pardon if I wander from the mic I'm reading.
[07:29.690 --> 07:32.130]  As the language reads at the time of this writing,
[07:32.130 --> 07:35.450]  which was February 17th of this year,
[07:36.770 --> 07:40.930]  we have a proposed bill that would cap THC potency at 15 percent
[07:40.930 --> 07:43.730]  for both medical and recreational marijuana products.
[07:44.490 --> 07:47.610]  Presumably for edibles, they're going to leave that
[07:47.610 --> 07:50.650]  with a hundred milligram recreational limit.
[07:50.650 --> 07:54.050]  And what is it, 300 package for med?
[07:55.010 --> 07:56.530]  I think so. Might be higher.
[07:56.530 --> 07:59.730]  But anyway, it's been so long since I bought a med edible.
[08:00.410 --> 08:05.410]  They'll probably leave the med limits alone for the potency limits
[08:05.410 --> 08:07.330]  for edibles alone for now.
[08:07.330 --> 08:11.290]  But this would apply to flowers and concentrates. OK.
[08:11.970 --> 08:15.170]  If that sounds insane to some of y'all, there's some reasons for that.
[08:16.010 --> 08:18.490]  Yeah, it should sound worse.
[08:18.490 --> 08:20.730]  The the legislation.
[08:22.450 --> 08:23.970]  Excuse me. Tongue tied.
[08:23.970 --> 08:27.130]  The representative behind this bill, and I'm going to butcher her name
[08:27.130 --> 08:29.330]  and I apologize for that. It is not intentional.
[08:30.330 --> 08:34.770]  I'm just bad at this is Yadra Cove.
[08:37.130 --> 08:39.610]  She's a Colorado representative from Thornton.
[08:39.610 --> 08:41.410]  She's the sponsor of the bill.
[08:41.410 --> 08:43.610]  She's also a pediatrician.
[08:43.610 --> 08:47.570]  And her slant on this is that high potency
[08:47.570 --> 08:50.050]  cannabis products are bad for teenagers.
[08:50.530 --> 08:54.090]  And so they shouldn't exist in the legal market in Colorado.
[08:54.930 --> 08:57.130]  That's their starting off point.
[08:57.130 --> 09:01.370]  And over the years, they've slowly built a foothold in the legislature
[09:01.370 --> 09:04.770]  where this bill is instead of getting laughed out of the door,
[09:05.770 --> 09:10.610]  is slowly working its way through the process of becoming a bill.
[09:11.050 --> 09:14.530]  But the products aren't for teenagers, so that shouldn't even be a thing.
[09:15.490 --> 09:17.210]  It shouldn't be.
[09:17.210 --> 09:21.530]  But if you're 18, you can shop medically.
[09:22.530 --> 09:25.210]  And there it's.
[09:26.250 --> 09:28.690]  The think of the kids angle is just what it's always been.
[09:28.690 --> 09:31.410]  It's just a ploy or a ruse. Yeah.
[09:32.370 --> 09:34.650]  The lawyer brain in me goes, well, yeah, you don't want the teenagers
[09:34.650 --> 09:35.530]  just have it. That's fine.
[09:35.530 --> 09:36.530]  We don't sell it to teenagers.
[09:36.530 --> 09:37.970]  Why we check on the word.
[09:37.970 --> 09:41.090]  You've got to be 21 to get it. Yeah, that's that's how we stop that.
[09:41.770 --> 09:45.010]  If you're in the dispensary shopping legally under 18,
[09:45.370 --> 09:48.650]  you have two physicians monitoring your care.
[09:50.370 --> 09:52.970]  It's it's not willy nilly.
[09:52.970 --> 09:55.290]  A parent has to do all the shopping like it's
[09:57.370 --> 10:01.530]  it's very regulated in Colorado, more regulated than anything else we have here.
[10:02.370 --> 10:05.370]  But the anti-pot groups
[10:05.650 --> 10:10.930]  maybe four years ago realized that they didn't have a prayer
[10:11.890 --> 10:15.130]  of getting a repeal passed through the vote.
[10:15.690 --> 10:19.850]  There's no way that the voters are going to vote out marijuana
[10:19.850 --> 10:22.090]  once it's been voted in. It's just not going to happen.
[10:22.130 --> 10:23.210]  Oh, there's so much money.
[10:23.210 --> 10:25.970]  It's not going anywhere with all the money it makes. Yep.
[10:27.010 --> 10:30.930]  So two years ago, I think
[10:30.930 --> 10:35.010]  they tried to do a ballot measure that would do the same thing.
[10:35.010 --> 10:37.010]  Cap potency at 15 percent.
[10:39.090 --> 10:41.890]  Their ballot measure went nowhere
[10:41.890 --> 10:46.010]  because one of the marijuana industry groups in Denver
[10:46.290 --> 10:50.650]  hired the two or three signature gathering firms in Colorado
[10:50.650 --> 10:53.450]  and just said, you're busy now when they call.
[10:53.450 --> 10:55.290]  Don't answer the phone.
[10:55.290 --> 10:57.010]  Here's your finder's fee.
[10:57.010 --> 10:59.010]  And that was the end of that.
[10:59.290 --> 11:02.250]  The 15, 15 percent potency bill
[11:02.730 --> 11:06.850]  that was going to go through the ballot system like legalization did.
[11:07.250 --> 11:09.490]  That's dirty politics. It's playing dirty.
[11:09.490 --> 11:11.890]  I hate to say how much I like that approach.
[11:12.370 --> 11:15.530]  It is playing dirty, but I like that our side's playing dirty.
[11:15.530 --> 11:19.250]  Considering these laws were playing dirty to begin with.
[11:19.250 --> 11:23.330]  Like there were never a bunch of doctors that were like, hey, this is hurting people.
[11:23.330 --> 11:25.410]  We should make it harder to get.
[11:25.410 --> 11:29.530]  It was always politicians going, you know, life would be easier
[11:29.530 --> 11:31.570]  if poor and brown people couldn't vote.
[11:31.570 --> 11:35.210]  Yeah. So why don't we make the stuff that they like to do when they're off hours
[11:35.210 --> 11:39.570]  illegal and we can just arrest them and make them felons
[11:39.570 --> 11:42.010]  and we don't ever have to count their votes again.
[11:43.810 --> 11:48.370]  So when we did that two years ago, I thought that's funny.
[11:48.410 --> 11:51.730]  Like I would have preferred a good, good old fashioned shellacking.
[11:52.410 --> 11:54.890]  And I like that.
[11:54.890 --> 11:58.650]  They were completely thwarted by having to be grassroots,
[11:59.170 --> 12:01.970]  like if they can't hire people to do the signature gathering,
[12:02.370 --> 12:06.090]  that means they would have to have a broad base of support
[12:06.090 --> 12:08.370]  willing to do it themselves.
[12:08.370 --> 12:10.290]  And this happens all the time in Colorado.
[12:10.290 --> 12:15.010]  It might be harder in other places, but we have at least one active recall
[12:15.010 --> 12:16.890]  effort going all the time, right?
[12:16.890 --> 12:20.290]  Where a group of people is trying to oust a politician or change a law.
[12:21.050 --> 12:24.130]  And so signature gathering is pretty common here.
[12:24.770 --> 12:27.890]  This could have been done if they had support and they didn't.
[12:28.970 --> 12:33.210]  So now they're back and they found a representative from Thornton
[12:33.210 --> 12:35.450]  to sponsor the bill.
[12:35.450 --> 12:38.650]  They were trying to keep it a secret in a draft, got left in a copy
[12:38.650 --> 12:42.050]  or somewhere or something, and they got outed about three months ago
[12:43.170 --> 12:45.330]  since then. There's been some reporting on it.
[12:47.690 --> 12:49.890]  The bill wants to do some other stuff, too, like
[12:50.890 --> 12:53.850]  wants to create a medical marijuana monitoring program
[12:53.850 --> 12:57.370]  so patients purchases are tracked in a statewide system
[12:57.810 --> 13:00.490]  and try to limit looping.
[13:02.890 --> 13:07.090]  They want better tracking of the patient doctor relationship
[13:07.090 --> 13:09.890]  so that they can make sure that the doctor that signed your medical
[13:09.890 --> 13:14.490]  marijuana card is really monitoring your progress in your health and all of that.
[13:15.290 --> 13:19.770]  They want data collection to track the effects of high potency THC products.
[13:20.530 --> 13:24.730]  It seeks to protect public health through potency limits
[13:24.730 --> 13:28.410]  and the prohibition of dangerous products used by underage youth.
[13:31.770 --> 13:33.610]  Sorry, I'm reading.
[13:33.610 --> 13:35.290]  Yeah, they just want to be all up in my business.
[13:35.290 --> 13:36.170]  I'm a fucking adult.
[13:36.170 --> 13:39.210]  I've already got a medical marijuana card from my doctor who approves.
[13:39.530 --> 13:41.650]  And there's no reason for anybody else to step in.
[13:41.890 --> 13:44.930]  That's one of my favorite things about medical cannabis is that I can dose
[13:45.210 --> 13:48.650]  myself without I know I'm not going to kill myself so I could dose myself
[13:49.050 --> 13:50.930]  if it still hurts, I could take more.
[13:50.930 --> 13:52.930]  If it doesn't hurt so much, I don't have to take as much.
[13:53.170 --> 13:56.490]  I don't need somebody involved that doesn't know what the fuck
[13:56.490 --> 13:58.490]  they're talking about in my medicine.
[13:58.490 --> 14:03.930]  Yeah, it's not like a number of other medicines that we have in the house.
[14:04.410 --> 14:05.290]  Like, it's a little weird.
[14:05.290 --> 14:08.050]  Cannabis is the only medicine in my house that's locked up.
[14:08.650 --> 14:12.650]  But there are a bunch of medicines in my house
[14:12.730 --> 14:16.450]  that will harm my kids if my kids eat the whole container.
[14:17.010 --> 14:19.010]  And with the cannabis, if that were to happen,
[14:19.010 --> 14:21.370]  it'd just be sleepy time for quite a while.
[14:21.490 --> 14:24.770]  Right. And you'd probably face way more legal problems
[14:24.770 --> 14:27.650]  if they ate your cannabis than if they ate the bottle of bleach. Yeah.
[14:29.690 --> 14:31.250]  It's really unfortunate
[14:31.250 --> 14:34.650]  that the laws are still as screwed up as they are, especially around this, but.
[14:36.010 --> 14:40.450]  It's basically nonsense, there's so many different facets of why this is horseshit
[14:41.050 --> 14:44.970]  like they say they picked the 15 percent number because that's where other
[14:44.970 --> 14:47.490]  countries have found
[14:48.650 --> 14:51.410]  or bad effects on cannabis products.
[14:51.970 --> 14:55.610]  And it's just a myth like we've had hashish.
[14:56.610 --> 14:59.890]  Yeah. Since prehistory.
[14:59.890 --> 15:04.290]  We know through modern testing that
[15:05.930 --> 15:09.890]  like hand rub hash, old school hash that's been around since the 70s.
[15:10.810 --> 15:13.410]  Dry sieve hash that's been around since the.
[15:13.770 --> 15:18.130]  I mean, I said the 60s and 70s, it's been around a hell of a lot longer than that.
[15:19.370 --> 15:22.690]  That's when it got popular again in the US and popular culture.
[15:23.370 --> 15:27.330]  But these forms of hash are like 30 to 60 percent pure.
[15:28.050 --> 15:31.450]  That's been true the whole time.
[15:31.850 --> 15:36.970]  If making cannabis products more pure led to more negative outcomes,
[15:36.970 --> 15:39.450]  we would have noticed a long fucking time ago.
[15:40.770 --> 15:42.890]  You and I would be displaying it.
[15:42.890 --> 15:47.450]  Right. Or during the clinical trials for Marinol or it's knockoffs.
[15:48.930 --> 15:51.770]  We would have found something other than what we see.
[15:52.330 --> 15:55.450]  Like we've all been around people that consume too much cannabis
[15:55.450 --> 15:56.370]  and got a little too high.
[15:56.370 --> 16:00.130]  And it's like, oh, buddy, you need a Snickers and like a chair.
[16:00.410 --> 16:02.810]  Yeah. Here's a Gatorade and a burrito.
[16:02.810 --> 16:06.250]  You know, that's your prescription to get better from your weed overdose.
[16:06.330 --> 16:09.010]  Take a little bit of a nap and you'll be just fine. Yeah.
[16:09.970 --> 16:11.930]  I mean, maybe.
[16:12.050 --> 16:15.450]  First time or two way overdo it, like still high at breakfast.
[16:16.330 --> 16:19.610]  But like a lot of that's just because you're in a better mood
[16:19.610 --> 16:20.930]  and you see the world better.
[16:20.930 --> 16:24.090]  Yeah. I got any edibles to still be high at breakfast. Shit.
[16:24.330 --> 16:28.810]  But like the 15 percent number they're picking is trash.
[16:29.730 --> 16:32.970]  They like to pretend that that's where cannabis gets dangerous
[16:32.970 --> 16:36.490]  because that's the number Britain randomly picked like 30 years ago
[16:36.970 --> 16:40.090]  to differ or to differentiate between
[16:42.170 --> 16:44.850]  can't regular cannabis and what they call skunk.
[16:45.970 --> 16:47.970]  The Netherlands followed suit.
[16:47.970 --> 16:50.450]  Similarly, there's a potency cap
[16:52.650 --> 16:55.050]  where in the Dutch market, cannabis isn't legal.
[16:55.050 --> 16:57.250]  It's just overly tolerated.
[16:57.250 --> 16:59.530]  Overly is the wrong word, but highly tolerated.
[17:00.210 --> 17:04.090]  And so it a certain THC percentage in flower.
[17:04.690 --> 17:08.730]  The the Dutch government officially considers cannabis
[17:08.730 --> 17:10.690]  worth caring about again.
[17:10.690 --> 17:14.210]  And so that's been misconstrued by
[17:16.130 --> 17:20.450]  prohibitionist in the States is that's when the cannabis gets dangerous
[17:20.450 --> 17:22.490]  is when it's over 15 or 16 percent.
[17:22.490 --> 17:25.410]  So ridiculous. It's absolutely ridiculous.
[17:26.010 --> 17:30.530]  So if you're a medical patient, don't you need potent medicine if you are?
[17:30.850 --> 17:33.010]  And I'm just asking not necessarily.
[17:33.010 --> 17:34.290]  But yeah, yeah.
[17:34.290 --> 17:36.810]  So a lot of good reasons to have potent medicine.
[17:36.850 --> 17:39.530]  Would you rather me take if I were sick and elderly?
[17:40.010 --> 17:44.890]  Would you rather me take 17 inhalations off of a shitty product or two dabs?
[17:45.130 --> 17:48.210]  That's two ins and outs of breathing to get the medication I need.
[17:48.490 --> 17:50.650]  We're not going to consume less.
[17:50.650 --> 17:54.090]  We're going to consume more if it's a lesser quality product.
[17:54.090 --> 17:55.410]  We're just going to consume more. Right.
[17:55.410 --> 17:59.970]  And if they're talking about monitoring and limiting our purchasing even further,
[18:00.570 --> 18:01.370]  we're going to have to.
[18:01.370 --> 18:04.330]  This is going to drive me back to the black market is what this will do.
[18:04.490 --> 18:06.490]  I know how much I buy every week I go.
[18:06.490 --> 18:09.610]  I buy my limit probably two times a week when it comes to concentrates.
[18:09.610 --> 18:11.570]  I know what day my favorite dispensary gets a drop.
[18:11.570 --> 18:13.530]  Shout out to you guys over there. You know who you are.
[18:13.530 --> 18:15.170]  I would say your name, but I don't want more people
[18:15.170 --> 18:16.650]  cleaning you out on the concentrates.
[18:16.650 --> 18:19.610]  That's why you're not getting a shout out enough. Yeah. Yeah.
[18:19.610 --> 18:21.730]  So I go there and I get my concentrates about twice a week.
[18:21.730 --> 18:22.730]  I get my limit.
[18:22.730 --> 18:26.010]  And by the time I'm ready to go back, I'm close to running out.
[18:26.330 --> 18:29.130]  So if they restrict my limit of purchases,
[18:29.130 --> 18:31.850]  that's going to fuck me up if they restrict the potency.
[18:32.290 --> 18:35.770]  They would be cutting my potency in essentially a third.
[18:36.490 --> 18:38.170]  No less than what's.
[18:38.170 --> 18:41.610]  And that's not even the tip of why this bill is bad.
[18:41.610 --> 18:45.330]  Like, it'll be super annoying for you and me because we'll have to consume
[18:45.330 --> 18:47.410]  a much higher volume of product.
[18:47.570 --> 18:52.690]  I'd be getting one fifth of the potency on this jar if it were limited to 15%.
[18:53.530 --> 18:57.930]  But it's not just like what's the other 85% now?
[18:58.290 --> 18:59.250]  That's why I got that.
[18:59.250 --> 19:04.050]  No, that is what led to the vaping crisis last year,
[19:04.050 --> 19:06.090]  the year before last in 2019.
[19:06.850 --> 19:10.290]  God, 2020 still seems like five years in my head. Yeah.
[19:12.090 --> 19:15.570]  But in 2019, there was a big vaping crisis coast to coast,
[19:15.570 --> 19:19.650]  and it took a while for us to really shake out the data.
[19:19.650 --> 19:23.930]  But once we did, we found that it's a leak
[19:24.010 --> 19:27.650]  or it's additives to THC in cartridges.
[19:28.130 --> 19:31.010]  And so it's shitty cartridges and shitty additives
[19:31.450 --> 19:32.890]  that were causing the problem.
[19:32.890 --> 19:37.770]  And people were consuming those two things because they wanted the THC,
[19:38.330 --> 19:40.450]  which doesn't harm anybody.
[19:40.450 --> 19:44.490]  So it's the additives that they now wanted us to make up
[19:44.930 --> 19:47.410]  85% of our extracts.
[19:47.450 --> 19:50.010]  Yeah. And how am I going to grow?
[19:50.090 --> 19:52.770]  I can't grow flowers that are 15% or lower.
[19:53.010 --> 19:53.610]  I would not.
[19:53.610 --> 19:58.570]  That's the real reason they picked 15 is because it would gut the industry.
[19:59.730 --> 20:02.770]  They know they can't vote us away.
[20:02.770 --> 20:06.330]  And so they're hoping to to make a rule that it's impossible to meet.
[20:07.170 --> 20:09.850]  The whole industry would have to rebreed.
[20:09.850 --> 20:12.130]  Yeah, it's not like a paint color.
[20:12.410 --> 20:14.650]  We can't be like, oh, there's too much blue in that.
[20:14.650 --> 20:17.170]  Put a little more white in and tone it down.
[20:17.330 --> 20:22.050]  No, it's you can't spray some on it to bring the THC percentage
[20:22.050 --> 20:22.930]  down a little bit.
[20:24.090 --> 20:26.490]  You could do what they do at the University of Mississippi
[20:26.490 --> 20:31.850]  and put the whole plant through a blender and call that final product, I guess.
[20:33.290 --> 20:37.650]  They brag about being able to provide any THC content you want.
[20:37.730 --> 20:41.770]  And yes, just they take their trash and clean it up
[20:41.770 --> 20:43.530]  until it's just hash if you want them to.
[20:46.330 --> 20:51.410]  But in Colorado, we've been breeding for THC
[20:51.410 --> 20:54.370]  for. God, what?
[20:54.610 --> 20:55.730]  Since well, years.
[20:55.730 --> 20:58.090]  Yeah, I was going to say since fucking 60s, probably.
[20:58.090 --> 21:00.530]  That's because we didn't know about the secondary cannabinoids.
[21:00.530 --> 21:03.210]  We didn't care. We just wanted to get high as we didn't have lab.
[21:03.730 --> 21:06.450]  One of the one of the problems of prohibition
[21:06.450 --> 21:08.050]  is smoking the weed anyway.
[21:08.050 --> 21:10.170]  I'm tired of lab test machines aren't smoking the weed.
[21:10.450 --> 21:12.730]  What does it do for people like we didn't know what we had?
[21:12.810 --> 21:17.010]  Yeah. I mean, until they really discovered THC
[21:17.010 --> 21:20.850]  and really figured out a lot about it, it was just marijuana is fun.
[21:20.850 --> 21:22.170]  And we're not sure why.
[21:22.170 --> 21:24.850]  Yeah. And then it was, oh, it's because of the THC.
[21:24.850 --> 21:29.290]  And we didn't get to even thinking about the other stuff until medical
[21:29.730 --> 21:32.770]  had already been around the country for a decade.
[21:33.770 --> 21:37.930]  But at this point, to try to rebreed
[21:39.090 --> 21:41.850]  an entire genetic line
[21:41.850 --> 21:46.890]  across the state down to below 15 percent flower, it's impossible.
[21:46.890 --> 21:50.050]  It would take two or three years of trial and error
[21:50.490 --> 21:55.050]  in crossbreeding the CBD rich, low THC genetics.
[21:55.850 --> 21:56.770]  And that's the point.
[21:56.770 --> 21:59.450]  If they make us take a two year non-profitable,
[21:59.450 --> 22:01.210]  we have to completely. Oh, yeah.
[22:01.210 --> 22:02.810]  Time out. We're done.
[22:02.810 --> 22:05.490]  Do you think the labs will do us the same favor that they probably do
[22:05.490 --> 22:08.890]  for some people and just mark this as 12 instead of 32?
[22:09.890 --> 22:11.650]  Probably not.
[22:12.210 --> 22:13.210]  I don't know that the labs do that.
[22:13.210 --> 22:15.610]  Everybody says those labs cheat. They pay the labs.
[22:15.810 --> 22:17.450]  Dude, I don't know who to pay.
[22:17.450 --> 22:18.610]  I worked with the labs.
[22:18.610 --> 22:20.330]  I sent so much product to the labs.
[22:20.330 --> 22:21.530]  I honestly look into this camera.
[22:21.530 --> 22:23.130]  We've never paid for a good lab test.
[22:23.130 --> 22:25.370]  I've got some of the highest lab tests in the fucking country.
[22:25.570 --> 22:27.170]  And we've never paid for a lab test.
[22:27.170 --> 22:28.650]  Wouldn't know who the fuck to pay if I had to.
[22:28.650 --> 22:31.650]  They bill us for our time and shit, but I don't know who to pay for higher numbers.
[22:31.650 --> 22:32.370]  So that's not a thing.
[22:32.370 --> 22:34.810]  You guys could say on that shit. Come on.
[22:34.810 --> 22:38.730]  It. There were a couple of labs
[22:38.730 --> 22:43.130]  that tried it right at the start before we had rules,
[22:43.690 --> 22:47.210]  because before we had rules, people were asking for labs.
[22:47.690 --> 22:49.810]  And so labs started to crop up.
[22:49.810 --> 22:55.010]  And it was about then that the state was like, wait, they have what now?
[22:55.210 --> 22:57.450]  What do you mean a lab like a crack house?
[22:57.450 --> 23:01.130]  And it was like, no, like a testing lab where a computer tells you what's in it.
[23:02.050 --> 23:05.050]  And that's when they really threw down the first layer of rules.
[23:05.650 --> 23:10.330]  But I think only one or two potency scandals like that have actually happened
[23:10.330 --> 23:13.290]  in the country. It's it's just it's almost an urban legend.
[23:13.850 --> 23:16.890]  Yeah, not quite purely people outside of the industry
[23:16.890 --> 23:19.130]  are the ones that you hear saying they paid for a higher test.
[23:19.130 --> 23:21.130]  It's always those people, the people that aren't involved.
[23:21.130 --> 23:22.850]  So there you go, guys. Myth busted.
[23:22.850 --> 23:26.410]  Do you it's highly unlikely that anybody is paying for a lab test?
[23:26.450 --> 23:30.410]  I've seen stores bullshit customers for sure.
[23:30.450 --> 23:32.810]  Stores can do it. Yeah. Stores are on a jar.
[23:33.130 --> 23:33.890]  Nobody's going to check.
[23:33.890 --> 23:38.250]  It's salesmen can like there's not an oath that you take
[23:38.690 --> 23:40.930]  where you swear on a constitution of like,
[23:41.570 --> 23:44.650]  I will do whatever the fuck I have to do to get tips in my tip jar.
[23:44.690 --> 23:46.530]  That is the oath to buy tender.
[23:46.530 --> 23:50.130]  Yeah, the the owner only cares what my numbers, my sales numbers are.
[23:50.130 --> 23:53.610]  And my sales numbers are better if I tell you what you want to hear as a customer.
[23:53.610 --> 23:55.650]  And that's just what am I going to be smoking, Mike?
[23:55.650 --> 23:58.290]  What's going to be in my dad's? What else is going to be in here?
[23:58.290 --> 24:01.650]  Am I going to be just they they haven't thought this out at all?
[24:01.730 --> 24:04.610]  There there's no talk about
[24:05.050 --> 24:08.930]  practicality or functionality at all because the people behind it
[24:09.290 --> 24:12.530]  know and want it to kill the industry.
[24:13.250 --> 24:18.690]  And everybody else is just hearing the we got to protect the kids piece of it.
[24:20.610 --> 24:23.010]  That's how it's built and packaged right now.
[24:23.010 --> 24:27.170]  And so far there's been industry pushback, but not.
[24:28.330 --> 24:31.490]  Organized or focused.
[24:31.490 --> 24:33.770]  So this one might stick around for a while.
[24:33.850 --> 24:35.330]  I hope it doesn't.
[24:35.330 --> 24:41.410]  Yeah, this one should get hammered down into nothing quickly and brutally
[24:42.210 --> 24:45.330]  because it's absolute backdoor horse shit like.
[24:45.970 --> 24:48.050]  Yeah, it's detrimental to the industry.
[24:48.050 --> 24:51.450]  It would really be the call to a vote.
[24:51.890 --> 24:54.890]  Be fucking voted out.
[24:54.890 --> 24:57.970]  Like if they really put it on the ballot and we got voted out,
[24:58.410 --> 25:01.370]  like I'd have some serious soul searching to do. But.
[25:02.370 --> 25:07.210]  This isn't that this is them trying to slip a, oh, you know,
[25:07.210 --> 25:09.610]  we're just trying to help out the kids and then on and on.
[25:09.690 --> 25:15.530]  Like, no, we already make it infinitely harder to get a weed
[25:15.530 --> 25:19.970]  than we do, like a bunch of bullets or alcohol.
[25:20.170 --> 25:21.250]  I was going to say a bottle of whiskey.
[25:21.250 --> 25:23.330]  I can drive down the street and get enough whiskey to kill me.
[25:23.530 --> 25:27.490]  Like I could literally no other product is limited like this.
[25:27.770 --> 25:31.770]  Yeah, there's there's nothing out there that I mean,
[25:31.770 --> 25:34.650]  because recreational cannabis is recreational Colorado,
[25:34.650 --> 25:37.050]  which is supposed to be legal, just like booze.
[25:37.530 --> 25:42.010]  But I can go to the liquor store and buy everything I can pay for.
[25:42.290 --> 25:44.050]  Yeah. Same thing with the gun store.
[25:44.050 --> 25:47.850]  Like I might have to wait a while to pick up some guns as opposed to others.
[25:48.370 --> 25:51.090]  And I'm not a big gun guy, so I don't know the ins and outs.
[25:51.090 --> 25:54.250]  So like I could get the pistols, but not the rifles or whatever the fuck.
[25:54.930 --> 25:58.050]  But like I know that I could be like, give me all the bullets.
[25:59.170 --> 26:01.970]  And normally, like right now, there's a limit of like one or two
[26:01.970 --> 26:03.690]  per customer everywhere because there's a shortage.
[26:03.690 --> 26:07.130]  But normally they'd be like cash or charge, sir.
[26:07.290 --> 26:11.970]  Yeah, I'll have the boy get the dolly and we'll start loading your truck.
[26:12.210 --> 26:18.610]  There you go. And I mean, same thing with farm tools or whatever the fuck.
[26:18.650 --> 26:20.410]  You know? Yeah. Yeah.
[26:20.410 --> 26:23.770]  I can I can hurt my I can hurt myself with anything, to be honest with you.
[26:23.770 --> 26:28.570]  So we've already got it limited to an ounce per person, per per store.
[26:29.170 --> 26:32.490]  If you want to amass a bunch, I guess you can go to store after store,
[26:32.490 --> 26:35.530]  after store and buy your ounce at each store every day.
[26:35.610 --> 26:36.250]  But like.
[26:37.370 --> 26:40.930]  The teenager can already just go to the liquor store,
[26:42.450 --> 26:46.650]  flash a fake ID just as easily as going to 15, 20 different dispensaries
[26:47.330 --> 26:51.050]  and walk out like it's just so we've already made it much harder
[26:51.050 --> 26:52.850]  to acquire a shitload of cannabis.
[26:52.850 --> 26:54.730]  Everybody's got a bigger burden.
[26:54.730 --> 26:57.290]  Everybody's got just window dressing.
[26:57.410 --> 27:00.090]  The people that want something find a way to get it.
[27:00.130 --> 27:03.290]  That's just how supply demand desires wants.
[27:03.290 --> 27:05.930]  That's either legally or illegally.
[27:05.930 --> 27:07.330]  We will get what we want.
[27:07.330 --> 27:08.810]  We're fucking humans. We have desires.
[27:08.810 --> 27:10.730]  We have wants and needs. We got money.
[27:10.730 --> 27:12.530]  There's a ways and means to get what we want.
[27:12.530 --> 27:13.930]  We'll fucking make it happen.
[27:13.930 --> 27:17.410]  So we should call this the Karen bill, because it sounds like just a bunch
[27:17.410 --> 27:20.730]  of fucking Karen's trying to get all Karen on our fucking product here.
[27:21.330 --> 27:25.610]  The national group to keep an eye on is called Project Sam.
[27:25.810 --> 27:28.930]  They've been pushing the
[27:28.930 --> 27:34.690]  THC is more potent or the THC in our marijuana products is higher than ever before.
[27:34.690 --> 27:36.610]  It's not your father's weed.
[27:36.610 --> 27:40.410]  I've heard that they've literally been saying that since we were in high school.
[27:40.650 --> 27:44.570]  It's when we were in school in the 80s and 90s, it was all marijuana
[27:44.570 --> 27:46.730]  is way stronger than it was in our day.
[27:46.730 --> 27:48.650]  And they've literally said that every year.
[27:48.650 --> 27:54.370]  Well, it is radical Russ added up and it has to be like 2000 percent THC to be
[27:54.930 --> 27:56.690]  if they were right each time.
[27:56.690 --> 27:58.130]  But it's a little bit stronger.
[27:58.130 --> 27:59.370]  It's a little bit stronger every year.
[27:59.370 --> 28:01.050]  And that's partly I am pushing that.
[28:01.050 --> 28:01.930]  There's a lot of us out there.
[28:01.930 --> 28:04.090]  Shout out to my breeder friends who are out there trying to push the limits
[28:04.090 --> 28:06.290]  on that THC. Don't fucking stop.
[28:06.850 --> 28:08.290]  Don't stop. I never stop.
[28:08.290 --> 28:10.570]  More potency. Also, more terps.
[28:11.090 --> 28:12.130]  Get the terps.
[28:12.130 --> 28:13.490]  Forget about the terps.
[28:13.490 --> 28:18.170]  The only place they've been successful with a constant potency cap is in
[28:18.650 --> 28:23.530]  Vermont. Right now, Vermont has a potency cap of 60 percent for concentrates.
[28:24.370 --> 28:28.010]  Apparently, Washington state is considering similar legislation.
[28:30.450 --> 28:35.170]  The anti-pot groups have figured out that don't do it isn't a winning message.
[28:35.810 --> 28:41.810]  And so they're shifted to a couple of similar tone down messages like just go
[28:41.810 --> 28:43.330]  with decriminalization.
[28:43.730 --> 28:45.290]  Somehow decrim is better.
[28:46.330 --> 28:48.450]  Denver was decrim when I was a teenager.
[28:48.450 --> 28:50.050]  It wasn't fucking better. I promise you.
[28:50.530 --> 28:52.890]  Right. I still take it.
[28:52.890 --> 28:57.610]  Same thing with cannabis is more potent now than ever before.
[28:59.330 --> 29:03.730]  There's a couple of others, big alcohol and big tobacco are going to take it over,
[29:04.210 --> 29:08.290]  which I chuckle. Like if either one of those industries got into marijuana, they'd
[29:08.290 --> 29:10.690]  be selling a much safer product to humanity.
[29:11.770 --> 29:13.170]  And like I don't like Marlboro.
[29:13.170 --> 29:15.050]  I gave them way too much money for way too long.
[29:15.450 --> 29:19.690]  But if they started selling weed like they're switching to a company or a product
[29:19.690 --> 29:24.010]  that kills zero people a year versus one that kills 400000, that's a net win for
[29:24.010 --> 29:28.250]  humanity. But they think it's a winning argument to be like, they might get into it
[29:28.250 --> 29:30.370]  too. Let's bring them on.
[29:31.010 --> 29:35.690]  I've never said that. We all the people like me have been busy working for the last
[29:35.690 --> 29:39.770]  couple of years. Like we haven't been fighting a good fight anymore.
[29:39.850 --> 29:43.650]  And so the people on the other side are starting to gain some traction again.
[29:43.650 --> 29:46.050]  So everybody needs to buck up.
[29:46.050 --> 29:47.930]  And I think I said it a bunch last time I was on.
[29:47.930 --> 29:50.690]  But find out who your elected representatives are.
[29:50.690 --> 29:55.170]  It's a one quick Internet search away and email them as often as you can.
[29:55.970 --> 29:57.330]  Get it legal where you are.
[29:57.330 --> 30:01.130]  If it's not, if it's legal where you are, the rules can be better.
[30:02.490 --> 30:03.970]  This is a Colorado issue here, Mike.
[30:03.970 --> 30:07.170]  So who do they contact here in Colorado to try to prevent the source?
[30:07.170 --> 30:08.850]  All of your elected reps.
[30:09.290 --> 30:12.050]  So just if you're in Colorado, it doesn't matter where you are.
[30:12.250 --> 30:16.610]  Who's my state representative for whatever your area is.
[30:16.610 --> 30:19.770]  Aurora, Denver, Thornton, Pueblo Springs.
[30:20.450 --> 30:22.130]  The names will come up.
[30:22.130 --> 30:25.290]  Send them an email down here in Pueblo.
[30:25.290 --> 30:29.810]  You're looking at Leroy Garcia, Danea Escar, I think.
[30:31.210 --> 30:31.850]  That sounds right.
[30:31.850 --> 30:33.690]  Since I checked.
[30:36.330 --> 30:38.970]  I know Boebert's our national rep.
[30:39.650 --> 30:43.290]  She's not going to be super helpful with federal legalization, but y'all can try.
[30:45.290 --> 30:46.490]  No comment.
[30:46.850 --> 30:50.730]  Yeah, we could do like another two hours on what's happening nationally
[30:50.730 --> 30:54.730]  and federally, because there is something like eight hundred and fifty
[30:54.810 --> 30:58.090]  marijuana bills in states and Congress right now.
[30:58.610 --> 31:00.970]  So there's a lot of movement everywhere.
[31:03.690 --> 31:06.570]  There's a dude from Nebraska.
[31:06.570 --> 31:10.170]  I don't know if he was the attorney general or the governor saying
[31:10.330 --> 31:13.010]  if you legalize marijuana, it's killing your kids.
[31:13.890 --> 31:19.410]  And he was serious when he said that into a microphone, staring at a camera
[31:20.010 --> 31:22.570]  and he was getting eaten alive on the Internet for it.
[31:22.570 --> 31:26.810]  But there's a whole different faction that's just eating it up.
[31:26.810 --> 31:28.570]  And they're like, yeah, he's right.
[31:28.570 --> 31:29.770]  It is.
[31:30.090 --> 31:35.010]  And then they throw out nonsense like traffic accidents or schizophrenia.
[31:35.650 --> 31:39.530]  I think a lot of our age, like our generation, the older people
[31:39.530 --> 31:42.930]  that were programmed with the reefer madness, with all the hysteria,
[31:43.410 --> 31:47.370]  unfortunately, slash fortunately, they're passing, they're disappearing,
[31:47.370 --> 31:50.250]  they're COVID's fucking wiping them out, they're getting old, they're retiring,
[31:50.250 --> 31:51.610]  they're going away.
[31:51.610 --> 31:54.410]  The younger generations are all about, let me do whatever the fuck I want.
[31:54.410 --> 31:57.450]  Generation dreadlocks, the generation, what do they call them?
[31:57.450 --> 31:58.370]  The millennials.
[31:58.370 --> 31:59.730]  A lot of us are them.
[31:59.730 --> 32:01.650]  Us, we're just like, let us do what we want.
[32:01.650 --> 32:05.330]  So pretty soon, a lot of the silly control stuff is going to go away.
[32:06.050 --> 32:07.530]  I say that's the hope.
[32:07.530 --> 32:09.770]  But they've been saying that since we were kids,
[32:09.770 --> 32:11.610]  they're taking away words and feelings now.
[32:11.610 --> 32:13.250]  So we're not allowed to have certain words and feelings.
[32:13.250 --> 32:15.050]  So I don't know where the future is going.
[32:15.050 --> 32:17.970]  Mike, I really thought I had a plan and some hope for the future
[32:17.970 --> 32:19.290]  until I thought deeper into it.
[32:19.290 --> 32:21.450]  And they took away words from us.
[32:21.450 --> 32:23.050]  So I don't know. It's different now.
[32:26.210 --> 32:28.170]  Did I just kill the whole show?
[32:28.170 --> 32:31.050]  We can go there, but no, I don't think the listeners
[32:31.090 --> 32:33.530]  are going to like my views on some of this stuff.
[32:34.690 --> 32:38.770]  So if they do limit the potency levels on flowers and concentrates,
[32:38.810 --> 32:42.970]  the entire industry will have to redesign their entire SOPs,
[32:42.970 --> 32:45.090]  their production facilities, their equipment.
[32:45.370 --> 32:46.690]  Everything will be different.
[32:48.250 --> 32:52.170]  Way worse than that, because you can't change potency with an SOP.
[32:53.690 --> 32:56.570]  I can't I can't throw less cow mag in the bucket
[32:56.570 --> 33:00.010]  and have the potency go from thirty one to eighteen.
[33:02.050 --> 33:05.810]  And with concentrates, they just do what they're doing now
[33:05.810 --> 33:07.970]  and then add eighty five percent bullshit.
[33:09.450 --> 33:11.530]  I don't know why anyone would want it's.
[33:12.410 --> 33:13.490]  That's the point.
[33:13.490 --> 33:20.170]  It's designed to destroy the industry and it's not even cloaked
[33:20.730 --> 33:25.410]  or veiled at all with that or other than the thinnest
[33:25.410 --> 33:28.410]  garnish of think of the children nonsense.
[33:28.850 --> 33:30.530]  It's really, really, really ugly.
[33:30.530 --> 33:33.570]  And the fact that this is gaining traction drives me fucking nuts
[33:34.050 --> 33:36.610]  because the whole argument for it is nonsense.
[33:39.170 --> 33:42.370]  The potency thing, it's not more potent than it was before.
[33:42.690 --> 33:47.450]  We've always had concentrates with butane extracts and stuff.
[33:47.450 --> 33:53.250]  We've purified it recreationally, but that's what Maranal is.
[33:54.250 --> 33:56.210]  Right. They already did that.
[33:56.210 --> 33:58.970]  It's not new or special.
[33:58.970 --> 34:03.930]  It's just. Advertised more so that everybody knows about it now.
[34:06.090 --> 34:08.010]  It's that there's a logical fallacy.
[34:08.010 --> 34:11.410]  I forget the name of it, but it's when you see something for the first time,
[34:11.730 --> 34:14.690]  your brain goes, oh, reggae must be new.
[34:14.970 --> 34:16.930]  I've never heard it before.
[34:16.930 --> 34:21.090]  And then somebody that's not clueless about reggae goes, oh, bro.
[34:21.770 --> 34:23.890]  Right. There's a whole section in the music store.
[34:23.890 --> 34:25.490]  Have you never seen this?
[34:25.490 --> 34:28.610]  And that's the same thing with hash when you're like, well, yeah,
[34:28.610 --> 34:33.490]  I know that wax and shatter looks scary and the dad rigs look kind of scary.
[34:33.490 --> 34:35.290]  But do you know about
[34:36.290 --> 34:38.770]  black tar hash and the hot knife hits?
[34:38.770 --> 34:41.210]  Because not any less scary.
[34:41.210 --> 34:43.490]  And they're like, oh, my God, what was that?
[34:43.490 --> 34:46.410]  And you start explaining some of the stuff and their jaw drops.
[34:46.770 --> 34:50.050]  And then there's there's inevitably one old guy in the group that's giggling.
[34:50.050 --> 34:52.050]  And it's like, you're the fucking one that went to parties.
[34:52.530 --> 34:57.650]  Does everybody in the generation above us knows about hot knife hits
[34:58.090 --> 35:02.130]  or a little piece of hash on a pin in a matchbook under a beer glass
[35:02.130 --> 35:04.730]  with a straw like before dad breaks?
[35:04.730 --> 35:09.250]  They had a bunch of stupid ways of just so many young listeners minds.
[35:09.250 --> 35:10.970]  Like, what's he fucking talking about?
[35:10.970 --> 35:15.530]  You guys go go think about all the videos, all knife hits.
[35:15.850 --> 35:19.210]  I used to put the hash on a pin with some heat under it somehow.
[35:19.570 --> 35:22.410]  If I can put a cup over it, so when the hash burns,
[35:22.410 --> 35:25.410]  you catch all the smoke in a cup and lift it up and suck the smoke out of the cup.
[35:25.890 --> 35:28.130]  We just have to do weird shit, everybody.
[35:28.130 --> 35:32.970]  They take two butter knives and set them on the stove until the ends glow.
[35:33.450 --> 35:38.330]  And instead of blow torch and a banger, you're just heating up two knives.
[35:38.330 --> 35:41.650]  And then you'd have a glass or a plastic straw.
[35:42.050 --> 35:46.250]  You'd mash a piece of hash between the two knives and free base it.
[35:47.290 --> 35:48.890]  There's no other way to say it.
[35:48.930 --> 35:49.770]  Yeah.
[35:50.930 --> 35:54.290]  Hash pipes like Weezer had that song back in 2001,
[35:54.650 --> 35:57.170]  but only people who travel internationally
[35:57.530 --> 36:00.490]  or were really into cannabis knew what the fuck they were talking about.
[36:02.210 --> 36:05.890]  Yeah, but it's not like it's not new, it's just redressed
[36:06.930 --> 36:11.490]  is is modern hash, and it's allowing people to replay fear cards
[36:11.490 --> 36:13.650]  that they haven't been able to play in 20 years.
[36:14.250 --> 36:16.010]  It drives me nuts.
[36:16.010 --> 36:18.290]  Yeah, we were at any point into it.
[36:18.290 --> 36:21.250]  We were at an event and back in the day, they would sell us
[36:21.970 --> 36:25.930]  CO2 concentrate oil like it's dab oil.
[36:25.930 --> 36:29.890]  You could dab it, you could smoke it, but it would come in a syringe,
[36:30.010 --> 36:34.050]  not like with a needle on it, but that's how they would measure it out.
[36:34.050 --> 36:35.690]  Like a frosting kind of.
[36:35.690 --> 36:38.210]  Yeah, it's an oral syringe is actually what it is.
[36:38.450 --> 36:39.370]  You can. Yeah.
[36:39.370 --> 36:42.490]  Yeah. So that you could feed up a kitten or something out of this little syringe.
[36:42.730 --> 36:45.170]  You just put in the kitten's mouth and shove the medicine down the kitten's
[36:45.170 --> 36:47.370]  throat instead of having to get it to eat something or something like that.
[36:47.370 --> 36:48.610]  That's what I used it for.
[36:48.610 --> 36:52.010]  But the owner of this place saw the syringe
[36:52.010 --> 36:54.610]  and he tried to make us all leave like, you guys have to get out of here.
[36:54.970 --> 36:56.810]  And I was like, well, that that's weed in there.
[36:56.810 --> 36:58.490]  And yet they did not believe us.
[36:58.490 --> 37:03.010]  I had to sit down and educate him because he saw what looked like a syringe
[37:03.130 --> 37:06.730]  and completely there was no talking, no fucking.
[37:07.090 --> 37:08.330]  It was just over.
[37:08.330 --> 37:12.050]  And I had to know now that the the syringes you'll see are popular
[37:12.050 --> 37:15.370]  in the dispensaries because you can refill cartridges with them. Yeah.
[37:15.410 --> 37:18.970]  And so instead of throwing your cart out when it's it goes empty
[37:18.970 --> 37:21.010]  for the first time because the cart's not toast,
[37:21.650 --> 37:23.810]  you can save a few bucks by refilling it.
[37:24.370 --> 37:28.530]  And every now and then some anti pop mom will get on Facebook
[37:29.050 --> 37:31.930]  and share a couple of cell phone photos.
[37:31.930 --> 37:36.850]  She snapped inside a dispensary or a screen grab off a dispensary menu
[37:36.850 --> 37:40.450]  on the online and it'll include a refill syringe.
[37:41.090 --> 37:44.970]  And then for the next two, three months, as I watch this photo,
[37:44.970 --> 37:48.290]  it gets bounced around the echo chamber that is the anti pot world.
[37:49.530 --> 37:53.330]  The the they get so fired up.
[37:53.330 --> 37:55.850]  Oh, my God. They're injecting THC now.
[37:55.850 --> 37:59.090]  And I heard it causes instant schizophrenia and.
[38:00.530 --> 38:04.410]  They're injected 100 percent pure THC, and it's doing crazy things.
[38:04.450 --> 38:06.330]  These crazy things. Yeah.
[38:06.330 --> 38:08.330]  And it's like it's a plastic.
[38:10.130 --> 38:11.610]  There's no need.
[38:11.610 --> 38:12.850]  No needle, no needle on there.
[38:12.850 --> 38:14.210]  You guys were not shooting up THC.
[38:14.210 --> 38:17.570]  Those syringes like a little thing, a decorative frosting.
[38:17.570 --> 38:20.170]  Like, yeah, a lot of times that oil, that's RSO.
[38:20.170 --> 38:22.810]  You scored out just a little like a pea size or a piece of rice
[38:22.810 --> 38:24.210]  under your finger and eat it.
[38:24.210 --> 38:26.770]  And you just put in the syringe because it's easier to push it out
[38:26.770 --> 38:27.930]  and dose it that way.
[38:27.930 --> 38:29.450]  It's not we're not going to shoot it up.
[38:29.450 --> 38:32.250]  You guys, honestly, that same club.
[38:32.250 --> 38:36.010]  I pulled out a bottle of water out of my backpack to fill up my dab rig.
[38:36.250 --> 38:38.290]  And the guy said, you can't bring beverages in here.
[38:38.290 --> 38:39.290]  I was like, bro, it's water.
[38:39.290 --> 38:42.130]  I can bring water in here is gift to buy beverages here.
[38:42.410 --> 38:44.530]  And I was like, it's to fill up my pipe, dude.
[38:44.730 --> 38:47.010]  And he almost made me throw my bottle of water away.
[38:47.210 --> 38:49.090]  And I was like, we're not coming back here. Don't worry.
[38:49.090 --> 38:51.730]  That's why we need real cannabis spaces.
[38:52.010 --> 38:57.730]  Yes. So bad. And man, if your state isn't legal yet,
[38:58.450 --> 39:02.290]  you got to be writing everyone in office right now saying,
[39:02.490 --> 39:05.730]  here's a way for us to make millions and millions of dollars.
[39:06.530 --> 39:08.730]  And all the information is online right now.
[39:08.730 --> 39:11.970]  You can put together a hell of an argument in like an hour.
[39:12.810 --> 39:17.810]  Um, email me if you need more information, send me a message on social media.
[39:18.010 --> 39:21.130]  Mike, write a write a template that people can copy and paste.
[39:21.730 --> 39:24.490]  Um, it's so it's so, so easy.
[39:24.490 --> 39:25.610]  Just go put it on your Facebook.
[39:25.610 --> 39:26.210]  Just hit.
[39:27.490 --> 39:31.610]  What we hit 10 billion in tax revenue.
[39:33.130 --> 39:34.370]  It might've been one billion.
[39:35.450 --> 39:36.090]  A billion.
[39:36.090 --> 39:39.170]  Fuck, look, we just hit another major billion dollar milestone.
[39:39.970 --> 39:43.050]  Um, why are all the roads still all fucked up?
[39:43.490 --> 39:47.730]  If we had a billion dollars in math, the road is still like a wreck.
[39:48.530 --> 39:52.730]  So the people ask that about the roads and the schools all the time.
[39:52.730 --> 39:56.690]  And it's just because roads cost more than you think roads cost.
[39:59.090 --> 40:01.090]  Like Colorado rakes in it.
[40:01.090 --> 40:05.090]  And what seems like an amazing amount of marijuana tax revenue.
[40:05.090 --> 40:08.050]  And I'm not saying it's not helpful.
[40:08.930 --> 40:14.850]  And the anti-pop people work very hard to make this fact seem shocking.
[40:15.330 --> 40:18.530]  But our pot revenue is about 1% of our state budget.
[40:19.650 --> 40:24.210]  Um, which I mean, 1% doesn't sound like a lot, but the number's huge.
[40:24.290 --> 40:27.450]  Like it's Colorado spends a lot of money every year.
[40:27.450 --> 40:28.290]  So does your state.
[40:29.090 --> 40:31.410]  Um, but 1% is super helpful.
[40:31.410 --> 40:33.010]  We're 1% less fucked.
[40:33.810 --> 40:39.490]  Um, everything's 1% better financially in Colorado because of our cannabis industry.
[40:39.970 --> 40:42.410]  And for the most part, that's business that's already happening.
[40:43.370 --> 40:47.610]  Um, everybody I know that smokes weed smoked weed before it was legal to smoke weed.
[40:48.170 --> 40:51.970]  And that includes the people that have become legal since legalization.
[40:52.010 --> 40:54.650]  They all smoked illegal weed before they were legal.
[40:55.330 --> 40:56.850]  That's just how it goes.
[40:57.170 --> 40:59.610]  It sounds like we might be going back to smoking more illegal weed.
[40:59.610 --> 41:01.770]  If they start fucking with my concentrates, Mike, I'm not going to
[41:01.770 --> 41:03.250]  smoke 15% dabs.
[41:03.290 --> 41:07.570]  I'll be pouring the entire Ram into my fucking, into the banger.
[41:07.570 --> 41:08.610]  Just every time.
[41:09.010 --> 41:09.330]  Yeah.
[41:09.410 --> 41:15.170]  We're trying to figure out how that that'll be the immediate response by people like us
[41:15.530 --> 41:16.890]  is down at the head shop.
[41:16.890 --> 41:24.570]  There'll be a new product where you use solution a and tab B to turn your 85%
[41:24.570 --> 41:28.290]  crap hash back into 90% good hash.
[41:29.130 --> 41:30.730]  That's just how it will be.
[41:31.170 --> 41:32.250]  Well, they fix the price.
[41:32.330 --> 41:37.010]  If I'm getting one fifth of my THC, do I get one fifth of the price?
[41:37.010 --> 41:37.650]  Do I get four?
[41:37.650 --> 41:39.010]  I got to pay for that filler.
[41:39.330 --> 41:40.690]  No.
[41:41.370 --> 41:41.570]  Yep.
[41:42.130 --> 41:45.770]  This is like it's, it's fully not functional.
[41:45.970 --> 41:49.370]  And it's, it's how I know that there's no good faith.
[41:49.890 --> 41:54.530]  If there was good faith here, they would have at least a couple of people who
[41:54.530 --> 41:59.610]  understand how the cannabis industry works and how we got here that would have
[41:59.610 --> 42:02.090]  talked to them out of ever attempting this bill.
[42:02.810 --> 42:07.850]  And it's, if your goal is really to protect the kids, there's a million
[42:07.850 --> 42:10.730]  ways that we can protect kids.
[42:10.730 --> 42:12.930]  Like it used to be my profession.
[42:12.930 --> 42:14.530]  It's my wife's profession.
[42:15.010 --> 42:19.890]  I know a lot of people whose job could be briefly or lightly
[42:19.890 --> 42:21.450]  described as protecting kids.
[42:21.850 --> 42:24.210]  And they could all use fucking more money and more funding and
[42:24.210 --> 42:25.890]  more resources and more people.
[42:26.370 --> 42:27.690]  But this isn't it.
[42:27.730 --> 42:29.530]  This is a killed the marijuana bill.
[42:29.650 --> 42:29.970]  Yeah.
[42:30.050 --> 42:32.170]  Killed marijuana industry bill, plain and simple.
[42:32.850 --> 42:36.850]  It it's not Karen's responsibility to make sure my daughter doesn't
[42:36.850 --> 42:38.250]  get high potency concentrates.
[42:38.250 --> 42:39.690]  It's my responsibility.
[42:39.690 --> 42:41.090]  I'm the one that bought it at the dispensary.
[42:41.090 --> 42:43.650]  I've got the money, the adult ID, though.
[42:43.650 --> 42:46.290]  I was going to say that medical marijuana card, but that's not even necessary.
[42:46.650 --> 42:47.690]  I've got all the credentials.
[42:47.690 --> 42:48.330]  I bought it.
[42:48.330 --> 42:50.330]  It's in my house where my daughter is.
[42:50.330 --> 42:53.410]  It's my responsibility to make sure she doesn't get it.
[42:53.650 --> 42:55.490]  So it's not Karen's responsibility.
[42:55.650 --> 42:57.930]  So Karen stay the fuck out of it.
[42:58.090 --> 42:59.090]  You got this under control.
[42:59.170 --> 43:01.690]  Well, it's it's not even that confused.
[43:01.690 --> 43:05.210]  Like the world is full of stuff that potency matters.
[43:05.970 --> 43:09.370]  Like I've got three different strengths to town on my fucking cabinet.
[43:09.850 --> 43:12.490]  I can take like eight of the little ones.
[43:12.490 --> 43:15.410]  But if I take eight of the big ones, it could be my last fucking headache.
[43:16.770 --> 43:19.210]  So same thing with the vodka.
[43:19.210 --> 43:22.410]  If I screw up and drink the vodka like it's Corona,
[43:23.050 --> 43:26.450]  really bad things are going to happen in my world that aren't at all
[43:27.010 --> 43:30.490]  intended or suggested by the manufacturer.
[43:31.690 --> 43:35.770]  Just because potent hash exists doesn't necessarily mean it's a problem.
[43:35.770 --> 43:39.450]  It just means there's nuance here that middle American never noticed.
[43:40.130 --> 43:41.570]  You don't see a bunch of shooters.
[43:41.570 --> 43:44.050]  You see big ass bottles of vodka at the store.
[43:44.570 --> 43:49.090]  Yep. All right, Mike, we've been going for approximately 40
[43:49.090 --> 43:51.130]  something ish minutes here, maybe a couple of edits.
[43:51.130 --> 43:52.050]  I know we talked for a minute.
[43:52.050 --> 43:52.930]  Sure. We started going.
[43:53.370 --> 43:56.770]  I think we covered all the major notes that I have made.
[43:56.770 --> 43:59.690]  Do you have any magical Mike moments that you would like to recap,
[43:59.690 --> 44:03.130]  regroup, re ramble upon before we start wrapping up this beautiful podcast?
[44:04.930 --> 44:07.890]  Now, just keep writing your elected officials
[44:07.890 --> 44:11.370]  and keep an eye on the anti-pop crowd because they're gaining traction again.
[44:11.370 --> 44:15.410]  And you always got to be wary of stupid people in large groups
[44:15.410 --> 44:19.290]  because they can do an amazing amount of damage if left unsupervised.
[44:19.810 --> 44:22.610]  If people have listened to this far, they're probably interested
[44:22.610 --> 44:25.370]  in the social are in the activism side of things.
[44:25.530 --> 44:28.050]  They want to know how to help us out and be on team cannabis.
[44:28.330 --> 44:30.490]  So I might remind them once again how they can find you
[44:30.490 --> 44:33.570]  so that you can help them be a part of team legalization.
[44:34.330 --> 44:37.890]  You can find me on Twitter at Nemo Punk 15.
[44:37.890 --> 44:42.130]  You can find me on Facebook at Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws.
[44:42.610 --> 44:47.650]  And you can find me on Patreon at Patreon dot com forward slash white Mike.
[44:47.890 --> 44:48.930]  Now, a smooth as shit.
[44:48.930 --> 44:50.930]  It is going to make sure you got that Patreon in there.
[44:50.930 --> 44:53.130]  Good job, buddy. You're getting good at this podcasting thing.
[44:53.330 --> 44:56.250]  I may let you come back on the show since you were so good at that.
[44:57.290 --> 44:59.930]  I'll try to be nice and I'll try not to get us death threats.
[45:00.770 --> 45:02.930]  There are only a couple. I handled them. It's OK.
[45:03.730 --> 45:06.130]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to support me on social media,

[45:12.090 --> 45:15.490]  I do post a lot on IRI underscore genetics.
[45:15.490 --> 45:17.730]  That's where I post the most on Instagram.
[45:17.730 --> 45:19.770]  I post more on cannabis.
[45:19.770 --> 45:21.330]  Let's talk about cannabis briefly here.
[45:21.330 --> 45:24.410]  Cannabis is a cannabis friendly social media application.
[45:24.410 --> 45:28.730]  You can't buy, sell or trade cannabis, but you can post all of your cannabis content.
[45:28.930 --> 45:31.050]  You can post pictures of your plants, your dried buds.

[45:35.530 --> 45:40.170]  All of the things that the other social media applications will chastise you for.
[45:40.370 --> 45:43.210]  We encourage and invite you to post those on cannabis.
[45:43.410 --> 45:44.570]  Cannabis is a free app.
[45:44.570 --> 45:46.890]  It's available on your Android or Apple device.

[45:54.690 --> 45:56.010]  I think you will enjoy cannabis.
[45:56.010 --> 45:58.290]  If you enjoy the show, you should enjoy cannabis.
[45:58.290 --> 45:59.330]  So give me a follow there.

[46:12.330 --> 46:13.170]  There's a merch spot.
[46:13.170 --> 46:16.650]  You can get shirts, stickers, hats, all kinds of great beanies, not hats.
[46:16.650 --> 46:17.370]  Let me correct myself.
[46:17.370 --> 46:20.730]  They're more like a beanie, not a build hat and get that sort of stuff there.
[46:21.170 --> 46:23.330]  Um, what else do I need to say?
[46:23.370 --> 46:24.210]  Oh, my Patriot.
[46:24.650 --> 46:28.170]  Also, if you feel like the episode was educational, informative, entertaining,

[46:30.450 --> 46:31.610]  or you'd like to support the cause.

[46:55.330 --> 46:56.890]  Also disclaimer.
[46:57.130 --> 46:58.930]  Uh, I've got a lot of messages.
[46:58.930 --> 47:00.370]  That's going to take me a minute to get back to you.
[47:00.410 --> 47:03.970]  That's one of my new year's resolutions was to be better at answering emails.
[47:05.170 --> 47:06.290]  I I'm trapped.
[47:06.410 --> 47:06.650]  Dude.
[47:06.650 --> 47:10.130]  It's hard when there's so many, every time you share your screen when we're
[47:10.130 --> 47:13.810]  prepping and I see something like a notification bar, it gives me so
[47:13.810 --> 47:15.050]  much fucking anxiety, bro.
[47:15.570 --> 47:18.810]  I think if I got the volume of traffic you get, I'd cry.
[47:19.010 --> 47:21.330]  Your notifications shouldn't be triple digits.
[47:21.330 --> 47:22.810]  That's all I'm saying, but they are.
[47:22.810 --> 47:24.450]  So I'm trying to, you guys, there's one of me.
[47:24.450 --> 47:25.330]  There are thousands of you.
[47:25.330 --> 47:29.330]  I love respect, appreciate, uh, never stop sending a stuff.
[47:30.290 --> 47:31.810]  Yeah, but it does take me a minute.
[47:31.810 --> 47:32.890]  I stay up late at night.
[47:32.890 --> 47:34.050]  I get up early in the morning.
[47:34.330 --> 47:36.330]  Uh, I'm trying and I do appreciate it.
[47:36.330 --> 47:39.850]  Don't stop, but don't feel like I've skipped you, abandoned you, forgotten you.
[47:40.090 --> 47:41.370]  You could be next on the list.
[47:41.370 --> 47:42.530]  You could be way down the list.
[47:42.570 --> 47:44.090]  Uh, just have faith in me.
[47:44.130 --> 47:47.330]  I'm doing my best to get to all of the content that you guys are requesting.
[47:47.570 --> 47:48.330]  I appreciate it.
[47:48.410 --> 47:52.210]  I love it, but it's just, I keep saying there's one of me while Mike is on the
[47:52.210 --> 47:53.490]  screen, but you guys know what I mean?
[47:53.570 --> 47:54.730]  It's mostly just one of me.
[47:55.410 --> 47:56.930]  Uh, where do we go from there?
[47:56.930 --> 47:57.170]  Mike?
[47:57.170 --> 47:58.890]  I got way off on a tangent there.
[47:59.010 --> 48:02.370]  I think that's all I wanted to confirm that there's only one roster, Jeff.
[48:03.050 --> 48:03.530]  Thank you, bro.
[48:03.570 --> 48:07.330]  Cause some people, there's only one white Mike.
[48:07.370 --> 48:07.850]  Thank God.
[48:08.050 --> 48:10.490]  Actually, I listened to another podcast and they talk about their friend, white
[48:10.490 --> 48:12.010]  Mike, all the time, and it's really funny.
[48:12.730 --> 48:19.370]  There are so many, like we all have, we even have subheadings that are the same.
[48:19.370 --> 48:20.730]  Like there's just too many mics.
[48:20.850 --> 48:21.570]  That's so funny.
[48:21.850 --> 48:22.050]  Yeah.
[48:22.050 --> 48:23.690]  That better not be you out there to live in the good life.
[48:23.690 --> 48:25.850]  That other white Mike I hear about he's having too much fun and
[48:25.850 --> 48:26.930]  you're not telling me about it.
[48:28.650 --> 48:30.010]  I wish I was out having fun.
[48:30.010 --> 48:33.050]  No, it's a lockdown life here, man.
[48:33.050 --> 48:37.930]  I just, one of my kids has, uh, a COVID unfriendly health conditions.
[48:38.210 --> 48:38.530]  Yes.
[48:38.530 --> 48:40.290]  So we're on, we're still on super lockdown.
[48:40.290 --> 48:40.530]  Y'all.
[48:41.530 --> 48:41.730]  Yeah.
[48:41.730 --> 48:46.490]  Mike has been a Hobbit for a minute now, but yeah.
[48:46.570 --> 48:48.130]  Jake's his head and looks into the camera.
[48:48.170 --> 48:48.770]  Yes.
[48:48.810 --> 48:49.130]  Yep.
[48:49.690 --> 48:50.010]  All right.
[48:50.050 --> 48:54.090]  I think that, uh, I think that wraps us up here for this episode of the podcast.
[48:54.090 --> 48:55.010]  I just want to fucking hang out.
[48:55.010 --> 48:55.770]  Thanks for listening.
[48:55.770 --> 48:56.330]  Everybody.
[48:56.450 --> 48:59.610]  We're going to try to pick some dabs and we're going to zoom it up together, bro.
[48:59.610 --> 49:00.410]  Cause we don't get to hang out.
[49:00.410 --> 49:01.450]  It's fucking late at night here.
[49:01.450 --> 49:02.210]  You got some time.
[49:02.210 --> 49:03.010]  It's quiet here.
[49:03.290 --> 49:04.410]  Uh, we're going to hang out.
[49:04.410 --> 49:05.090]  I'll do some gummy.
[49:05.610 --> 49:06.250]  Oh shit.
[49:06.290 --> 49:07.490]  On camera even.
[49:08.050 --> 49:11.530]  Um, yeah, I'm going to talk about that edibles challenge on the next episode.
[49:11.530 --> 49:14.330]  You guys, I'm going to recap the embracing organics edibles challenge.
[49:14.330 --> 49:16.490]  It'll be a brief talk, but we'll hit that one up on the next.
[49:16.490 --> 49:17.090]  I love it.
[49:17.530 --> 49:18.210]  It was a good time.
[49:18.610 --> 49:19.610]  Uh, we're not going to blow it now.
[49:19.650 --> 49:20.850]  Save that one for the next episode.
[49:20.970 --> 49:21.490]  Teaser.
[49:22.530 --> 49:23.770]  I'm going to tie in the next episode.
[49:23.770 --> 49:28.370]  I do plan on talking about renewing my medical marijuana card and, um,
[49:28.450 --> 49:34.250]  that edibles challenge and then I think I've got a question about Patreon and
[49:35.050 --> 49:39.650]  a, um, a photo question, like popping photos into the video question is the
[49:39.650 --> 49:41.450]  stuff that I've got highlighted for the next episode.
[49:41.650 --> 49:43.410]  I usually don't give hints about the next episode.
[49:43.410 --> 49:45.610]  So thank you for making it this far in the show, Mike.
[49:45.610 --> 49:46.570]  Thank you for being here, bro.
[49:46.650 --> 49:47.530]  It is time to wrap it up.
[49:47.530 --> 49:49.370]  I want to take a big fat fucking dad.
[49:49.370 --> 49:52.610]  So, um, you know, I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[49:52.610 --> 49:54.730]  I owe a big shout out to my buddy buzz bro.
[49:54.970 --> 49:56.530]  And until next time, take a fat dad.
[49:56.530 --> 49:59.730]  Oh, shout out to Mike also for being here until next time, take a fat dad
[50:00.010 --> 50:01.090]  and give your mom a hug for me.

[50:03.770 --> 50:04.130]  Thank you, bro.
[50:04.130 --> 50:04.730]  That was a fun one.
[50:05.210 --> 50:05.970]  Now I got to piss.
[50:06.010 --> 50:06.850]  I'll be back in a minute.
[50:06.850 --> 50:07.330]  Then we'll do.
[50:07.570 --> 50:07.730]  Cool.
[50:07.730 --> 50:08.370]  I'm going to do the same.
