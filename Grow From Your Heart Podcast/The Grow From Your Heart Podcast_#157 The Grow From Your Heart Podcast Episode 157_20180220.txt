[00:01.720 --> 00:42.800]  I'm your host, my friends call me Ross DeGeffo and I thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:42.800 --> 00:46.060]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots
[00:46.060 --> 00:48.860]  band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:48.860 --> 00:54.240]  Big shout to Kat, Koot and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:54.240 --> 00:56.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, to my left, a repeat offender.
[00:56.500 --> 00:58.340]  Welcome back to the show, Lindsey the Traveling Stoner.
[00:58.340 --> 00:59.340]  Welcome back, honey.
[00:59.340 --> 01:00.340]  Thank you for having me.
[01:00.340 --> 01:04.260]  Also, right in front of me, he's usually white Mike, but today he's kind of red.
[01:04.260 --> 01:05.260]  Welcome to the show, bro.
[01:05.260 --> 01:06.260]  What's up, everybody?
[01:06.260 --> 01:07.260]  How you doing, bud?
[01:07.260 --> 01:10.260]  Mike took a dab, coughed for about 15, 20 minutes, turned purple.
[01:10.260 --> 01:11.260]  I still got half a cough cooking.
[01:12.260 --> 01:13.260]  Feel free to cough.
[01:13.260 --> 01:14.900]  The coughs make it feel like people are there with us.
[01:14.900 --> 01:15.900]  There you go.
[01:15.900 --> 01:16.900]  Let it fly, bro.
[01:16.900 --> 01:17.900]  Let it fly.
[01:17.900 --> 01:18.900]  Welcome to the table, folks.
[01:18.900 --> 01:19.900]  Let it go.
[01:19.900 --> 01:20.900]  Welcome to the podcast, everybody.
[01:20.900 --> 01:23.780]  In this podcast, we are going to talk about some new purchase limits here in Colorado.
[01:23.780 --> 01:24.780]  We have been restricted.
[01:24.780 --> 01:34.340]  We've been restricted on how much hash we can purchase here in Colorado.
[01:34.340 --> 01:39.260]  Also, they've changed some rules on some edibles and also in Oregon, they have banned some
[01:39.260 --> 01:40.540]  popular strain names.
[01:40.540 --> 01:41.900]  We'll get to that in just a minute.
[01:41.900 --> 01:44.860]  First, let's talk a little bit about the secret sesh.
[01:44.860 --> 01:46.740]  I was at the secret sesh on Friday.
[01:46.740 --> 01:47.740]  Lindsey was also there.
[01:47.740 --> 01:48.740]  Mike couldn't make it.
[01:48.740 --> 01:51.220]  He had much more important things to handle.
[01:51.220 --> 01:55.540]  I finally am not working for a secret sesh and it's the wife's birthday.
[01:55.540 --> 01:56.540]  Happy birthday to the wife.
[01:56.540 --> 01:57.540]  Thanks, secret sesh.
[01:57.540 --> 01:59.100]  A secret sesh happens every month.
[01:59.100 --> 02:00.660]  Wife's birthday is only once a year.
[02:00.660 --> 02:01.660]  Yeah, once a month.
[02:01.660 --> 02:02.660]  Thank God.
[02:02.660 --> 02:03.660]  No, once a year.
[02:03.660 --> 02:04.660]  It was fun.
[02:04.660 --> 02:05.660]  Had a good night.
[02:05.660 --> 02:06.660]  Well, happy birthday to the wife.
[02:06.660 --> 02:07.660]  I know it's late, but still better late than never.
[02:07.660 --> 02:08.660]  Happy birthday to the wife.
[02:08.660 --> 02:10.500]  I know it's late, but still better late than never.
[02:10.500 --> 02:11.500]  Happy birthday, baby.
[02:11.500 --> 02:12.500]  Yeah.
[02:12.500 --> 02:16.740]  So, Lindsey and I and a whole bunch of other people had the pleasure of attending the secret
[02:16.740 --> 02:17.740]  sesh.
[02:17.740 --> 02:19.420]  What'd you think about the sesh?
[02:19.420 --> 02:21.900]  Honestly, I had a lot of fun at this one.
[02:21.900 --> 02:25.420]  We kind of squatted up a little bit on some couches.
[02:25.420 --> 02:26.420]  Invaded some space.
[02:26.420 --> 02:27.420]  Yeah.
[02:27.420 --> 02:28.420]  Took over some tables.
[02:28.420 --> 02:29.420]  Yeah.
[02:29.420 --> 02:30.420]  There weren't enough tables.
[02:30.420 --> 02:34.300]  So, a bunch of people brought super fancy glass.
[02:34.300 --> 02:35.300]  The dino, what was it?
[02:35.300 --> 02:36.300]  Dino, Joe P. collab.
[02:36.300 --> 02:37.300]  Yeah.
[02:37.300 --> 02:41.780]  And then, Max had his elbow Joe Peters collab.
[02:41.780 --> 02:42.780]  Super snazzy.
[02:42.780 --> 02:43.780]  Yeah.
[02:43.780 --> 02:46.780]  And then, Max had his Matt Robinson.
[02:46.780 --> 02:47.780]  I don't know.
[02:47.780 --> 02:48.780]  Is that a collab?
[02:48.780 --> 02:49.780]  I'm lost.
[02:49.780 --> 02:50.780]  The thing was gorgeous.
[02:50.780 --> 02:53.780]  I have no idea who made it, but it was beautiful.
[02:53.780 --> 02:55.860]  I know the shape of it is Matt Robinson.
[02:55.860 --> 02:56.860]  I think it's a collab.
[02:56.860 --> 02:58.420]  I'd have to re-look that up.
[02:58.420 --> 03:00.620]  It was a green giraffe?
[03:00.620 --> 03:05.220]  I bet you Brett and Chris are both listening to this episode screaming, it's a collab with
[03:05.220 --> 03:06.220]  so-and-so.
[03:06.220 --> 03:09.700]  Either way, whoever made it, both of those pieces were fancy fresh.
[03:09.700 --> 03:11.980]  And these dudes pull out these fancy rigs and there's no table.
[03:11.980 --> 03:15.100]  Yeah, it's like a heady zoo and there's nowhere for the zoo to like...
[03:15.100 --> 03:18.020]  So, we had some staff find some table space for us.
[03:18.020 --> 03:20.900]  We made a little bit of table space, threw some hash down.
[03:20.900 --> 03:22.300]  We got down pretty well.
[03:22.300 --> 03:23.780]  We got down.
[03:23.780 --> 03:27.340]  Big shout out to Ty for that huge ass dab.
[03:27.340 --> 03:28.820]  You can catch that on my Instagram.
[03:28.820 --> 03:29.820]  That was...
[03:29.820 --> 03:31.300]  That's the first time I got to hang out with Ty.
[03:31.300 --> 03:32.300]  That dude's a soldier.
[03:32.300 --> 03:34.140]  Yo, Ty is insane.
[03:34.140 --> 03:40.740]  Big shout out to Earl Tycoon on Instagram and THC Chocolates, which is his edible company
[03:40.740 --> 03:41.740]  as well.
[03:41.740 --> 03:42.740]  Nice.
[03:42.740 --> 03:43.740]  He threw me some stickers.
[03:43.740 --> 03:44.740]  It's a big shout out.
[03:44.740 --> 03:45.740]  I got those stickers.
[03:45.740 --> 03:46.740]  They're going to go on something cool.
[03:46.740 --> 03:47.740]  Probably a case of some sort.
[03:47.740 --> 03:48.740]  I got some of his edibles at the house.
[03:48.740 --> 03:49.740]  I'll let you have them.
[03:49.740 --> 03:50.740]  Edibles?
[03:50.740 --> 03:51.740]  Edibles.
[03:51.740 --> 03:52.740]  Well, speaking of edibles, that's a good segway.
[03:52.740 --> 03:53.740]  Sorry.
[03:53.740 --> 03:54.740]  At the Secret Sesh.
[03:54.740 --> 03:55.740]  No, it's perfect.
[03:55.740 --> 03:56.740]  I like it.
[03:56.740 --> 03:57.740]  I like it when you do that for me.
[03:57.740 --> 04:00.700]  At the Secret Sesh, our good friend Max sat down next to us.
[04:00.700 --> 04:02.380]  I've been trying not to say good friend.
[04:02.380 --> 04:03.380]  Remember a long time ago?
[04:03.620 --> 04:04.620]  Good buddy.
[04:04.620 --> 04:09.780]  Yeah, our friend Max from TNC Extraction sat down next to me at the Secret Sesh.
[04:09.780 --> 04:13.300]  He knows I don't eat bacon and he's felt bad for offering me medicated bacon at all the
[04:13.300 --> 04:15.820]  past sessions.
[04:15.820 --> 04:20.500]  He pulls out a banana pudding Schumet bar.
[04:20.500 --> 04:21.860]  It's 100 milligrams of THC.
[04:21.860 --> 04:22.860]  He hands this to me.
[04:22.860 --> 04:23.860]  He's like, here, bro.
[04:23.860 --> 04:24.860]  You want this?
[04:24.860 --> 04:25.860]  I was like, oh, you know what?
[04:25.860 --> 04:31.060]  I haven't eaten edibles in ... It's been four or five months since I had eaten edibles.
[04:31.060 --> 04:34.820]  I broke that banana pudding bar in half and I ate half of it.
[04:34.820 --> 04:38.340]  Did a little selfie video with Miss Lindsey here and I passed the other half of it to
[04:38.340 --> 04:39.340]  Lindsey.
[04:39.340 --> 04:40.340]  I think she split it with Bobo.
[04:40.340 --> 04:41.340]  I did.
[04:41.340 --> 04:43.340]  I am back on the edibles wagon.
[04:43.340 --> 04:44.340]  I eat edibles again.
[04:44.340 --> 04:45.340]  Yes.
[04:45.340 --> 04:48.740]  At the Secret Sesh, which was Friday, I ate the banana pudding bar.
[04:48.740 --> 04:52.140]  I ate a couple little smaller edibles that people gave me, like candies and such, like
[04:52.140 --> 04:53.140]  a caramel or something.
[04:53.140 --> 04:57.260]  Oh, and then I ate something else that we're going to talk about later on in the show.
[04:57.260 --> 05:02.740]  And then Saturday, I ate a 100 milligram Clottie Bear, a cherry one.
[05:02.740 --> 05:06.980]  Honestly, not to diss any Clottie Bears, but the cherry are absolutely not my favorite
[05:06.980 --> 05:07.980]  flavor.
[05:07.980 --> 05:08.980]  I didn't like the cherry one.
[05:08.980 --> 05:11.500]  It had a little bit of a medicine-y, funky aftertaste.
[05:11.500 --> 05:15.300]  The cherry that a lot of the candy companies use has that, ooh, medicine.
[05:15.300 --> 05:16.300]  Yeah.
[05:16.300 --> 05:17.300]  Yeah.
[05:17.300 --> 05:18.300]  I didn't prefer ... I like the root beer.
[05:18.300 --> 05:19.300]  It's fucking delicious.
[05:19.300 --> 05:21.180]  They've got an apple one that's really good.
[05:21.180 --> 05:24.380]  I like the ones that they have a raspberry that they actually dip in chocolate.
[05:24.380 --> 05:25.980]  Those are fucking delicious.
[05:26.420 --> 05:28.140]  The cherry didn't ... It got me high as shit.
[05:28.140 --> 05:30.900]  I slept like a baby, but I did not like the flavor.
[05:30.900 --> 05:33.180]  I wouldn't buy that one again.
[05:33.180 --> 05:40.940]  Then today, I ate from Gaia's Garden Edibles, I ate a 100 milligram milk chocolate cherry
[05:40.940 --> 05:43.340]  truffle, which was quite delicious.
[05:43.340 --> 05:44.340]  Sounds amazing.
[05:44.340 --> 05:48.140]  And I had to go slow to try to say what that was because it is obviously working on me.
[05:48.140 --> 05:49.140]  I can feel it.
[05:49.140 --> 05:50.300]  So, shout out to those guys.
[05:50.300 --> 05:51.300]  That was a delicious edible.
[05:51.300 --> 05:52.740]  So, I'm back in the edibles game.
[05:52.740 --> 05:57.980]  I got to go slowly because I catch myself just becoming way over medicated on the edibles.
[05:57.980 --> 05:59.620]  I can't do that to myself again.
[05:59.620 --> 06:02.780]  I don't want to get all fucking ruined and slow on edibles.
[06:02.780 --> 06:04.420]  So, secret session was a great time.
[06:04.420 --> 06:05.940]  Shout out to everybody that hung out.
[06:05.940 --> 06:06.940]  Yeah, absolutely.
[06:06.940 --> 06:13.380]  Brett, Max, and Ty for sure, them three, and Twisty as well.
[06:13.380 --> 06:14.700]  Twisty is where I was headed.
[06:14.700 --> 06:15.700]  Yup.
[06:15.700 --> 06:16.700]  Yeah, Twisty.
[06:16.700 --> 06:17.700]  And then what's the dude-
[06:17.700 --> 06:18.700]  And Dwayne.
[06:18.700 --> 06:19.700]  Dwayne.
[06:19.700 --> 06:20.700]  Yes.
[06:20.700 --> 06:21.700]  Absolutely.
[06:21.700 --> 06:22.700]  That's the dude whose name I did not know.
[06:23.660 --> 06:24.660]  Yeah.
[06:24.660 --> 06:25.660]  But we had a nice little crew there.
[06:25.660 --> 06:26.660]  Yeah.
[06:26.660 --> 06:27.660]  Uncle Stoner hung out with us a little bit.
[06:27.660 --> 06:29.740]  The dude in the vest that was filming everything, that's Uncle Stoner.
[06:29.740 --> 06:30.740]  He's kind of well-known.
[06:30.740 --> 06:31.740]  He's got his own show.
[06:31.740 --> 06:32.740]  Check him out if you're interested.
[06:32.740 --> 06:33.740]  Yeah.
[06:33.740 --> 06:34.740]  There were a lot of cool people.
[06:34.740 --> 06:35.740]  Adam Mill came and hung out with our little squad and took some dabs.
[06:35.740 --> 06:36.740]  Absolutely.
[06:36.740 --> 06:37.740]  Big shout out to Adam.
[06:37.740 --> 06:39.020]  Adam Mill holds it down.
[06:39.020 --> 06:40.260]  He's a really cool host.
[06:40.260 --> 06:43.820]  He's the kind of host that'll- There was a band playing, and as the band played, he just
[06:43.820 --> 06:47.140]  came and kicked it with us, rolled the backwood, hung out with us, took some dabs with the
[06:47.140 --> 06:51.020]  crew, flirted with a couple of chicks, and then skedaddled right on.
[06:51.020 --> 06:52.020]  Yeah.
[06:52.340 --> 06:53.340]  Shout out to Hunt.
[06:53.340 --> 06:54.340]  Hunt throws a hell of a party.
[06:54.340 --> 06:55.340]  Yes.
[06:55.340 --> 06:57.420]  This time at Secret Sesh, I did something that I don't usually do.
[06:57.420 --> 06:59.500]  I was given the VIP gift bag.
[06:59.500 --> 07:00.500]  Yes.
[07:00.500 --> 07:02.860]  Big shout out to Hunt for giving us both one of those.
[07:02.860 --> 07:03.860]  Yeah.
[07:03.860 --> 07:06.460]  Let's just real quickly go through the gift bag and talk about what's in here.
[07:06.460 --> 07:07.620]  There's a bunch of really cool stuff.
[07:07.620 --> 07:08.620]  A couple things.
[07:08.620 --> 07:09.620]  I'll do it like Christmas.
[07:09.620 --> 07:12.300]  I'm going to start with the things that are least impressive to the most impressive to
[07:12.300 --> 07:13.660]  me.
[07:13.660 --> 07:20.540]  A company called Healing Nations LLC, cultivation, consulting, cultivation systems, and nutrients,
[07:20.540 --> 07:23.740]  threw in a small baggie of cannabis.
[07:23.740 --> 07:26.620]  It's a little bit of buds.
[07:26.620 --> 07:27.660]  It's okay weed.
[07:27.660 --> 07:30.540]  It's not impressive weed, but it was a gift, so I appreciate it.
[07:30.540 --> 07:32.980]  We're going to smoke this here later on.
[07:32.980 --> 07:34.700]  But yeah, they threw in some weed.
[07:34.700 --> 07:39.580]  Also next up, the Lazy Lion threw in a real big flyer and a small baggie, and they threw
[07:39.580 --> 07:40.580]  down a pre-roll.
[07:40.580 --> 07:44.540]  So if you guys want to smoke a pre-roll joint, that's probably a gram and a half, two grams
[07:44.540 --> 07:45.540]  of weed in that joint.
[07:45.540 --> 07:46.540]  We could smoke that.
[07:46.540 --> 07:48.580]  Oh, I owe somebody a shout out.
[07:48.620 --> 07:52.780]  This is really random, off the cuff here, but somebody gave me an 18 gram joint.
[07:52.780 --> 07:57.060]  I was given an 18 gram joint that's rolled and ready to smoke.
[07:57.060 --> 07:59.140]  I was supposed to smoke it at the secret sesh.
[07:59.140 --> 08:02.580]  I was having a scattery day, and I did not take it to the secret sesh with me.
[08:02.580 --> 08:04.060]  Shout out to our friends in New Mexico.
[08:04.060 --> 08:07.540]  Shout out to Charlie Torres and his son.
[08:07.540 --> 08:12.140]  And also big shout out to Tim and everybody involved in Organica down in New Mexico.
[08:12.140 --> 08:13.340]  I love you guys.
[08:13.340 --> 08:20.100]  Those guys grew some Arise, and it tested at 30.8% THCA.
[08:20.100 --> 08:22.420]  So that's golden goat, crossed to the daybreaker.
[08:22.420 --> 08:26.620]  I gave them some seeds, and they grew the shit out of my stuff down there.
[08:26.620 --> 08:29.540]  So now I've got two strains that have been lab tested by Steep Hill.
[08:29.540 --> 08:31.540]  They've tested over 30% THCA.
[08:31.540 --> 08:34.420]  Two different labs, same company, right?
[08:34.420 --> 08:39.980]  Yeah, two different labs, one in Colorado, one in New Mexico, same company.
[08:39.980 --> 08:44.900]  The link to that is both strains are golden goat crosses.
[08:44.900 --> 08:48.700]  Lemon Jeffrey is the lemon skunk crossed to a golden goat reversed male.
[08:48.700 --> 08:50.180]  So it's a feminized seed.
[08:50.180 --> 08:52.180]  That one hit 31%.
[08:52.180 --> 08:58.380]  Then the Arise is the fucking golden goat.
[08:58.380 --> 08:59.380]  Sorry.
[08:59.380 --> 09:00.900]  I'm fucking full of shit right now.
[09:00.900 --> 09:04.380]  I'm going to have to edit part of this because I'm saying this all wrong.
[09:04.380 --> 09:05.380]  Lemon skunk is a lemon.
[09:05.380 --> 09:09.100]  Yeah, the lemon Jeffrey is a lemon skunk to the golden goat, and the Arise is golden goat
[09:09.220 --> 09:10.220]  to daybreaker.
[09:10.220 --> 09:13.460]  So it's basically the non-feminized version of the lemon Jeffrey.
[09:13.460 --> 09:16.940]  And they've got the golden goat parent in there, and those are both tested over 30%
[09:16.940 --> 09:17.940]  now.
[09:17.940 --> 09:18.940]  So shout out to my friends down there in New Mexico.
[09:18.940 --> 09:25.260]  Shout out to Charlie Torres, an organically grown, hand trimmed, perfectly cured, perfectly
[09:25.260 --> 09:27.580]  rolled 18 gram joint.
[09:27.580 --> 09:30.100]  It's going to get everybody high as shit wherever we go.
[09:30.100 --> 09:33.420]  They said they smoked one the other night at another event, and it went around for over
[09:33.420 --> 09:34.420]  an hour.
[09:34.420 --> 09:37.700]  So we're going to get lit wherever we go when we smoke that thing.
[09:37.700 --> 09:38.700]  Yeah, please call me when you find me.
[09:39.300 --> 09:40.300]  It smells delicious.
[09:40.300 --> 09:41.300]  It smells amazing.
[09:41.300 --> 09:44.060]  I haven't smoked it yet, but you can probably see it from here.
[09:44.060 --> 09:45.060]  It's on that table.
[09:45.060 --> 09:46.860]  It's that fucking baseball bat sitting over there.
[09:46.860 --> 09:47.860]  For sure.
[09:47.860 --> 09:48.860]  Yeah, that thing, I can't wait to smoke it.
[09:48.860 --> 09:49.980]  You showed it to me the other day.
[09:49.980 --> 09:51.260]  So shout out to our friends in New Mexico.
[09:51.260 --> 09:52.260]  They passed through here the other day.
[09:52.260 --> 09:54.580]  Gave me some dazzle, some rosin.
[09:54.580 --> 09:55.580]  Shout out to Woody.
[09:55.580 --> 09:56.580]  Shout out to the whole crew.
[09:56.580 --> 09:57.580]  I appreciate all you guys.
[09:57.580 --> 09:58.900]  So I'm going to continue on with this gift bag.
[09:58.900 --> 10:02.700]  There's a coupon in here for 15% off any purchase at a specific dispensary that didn't pay me
[10:02.700 --> 10:03.900]  for an ad.
[10:03.900 --> 10:05.220]  There's another sticker.
[10:05.220 --> 10:07.580]  There's a sticker from Gaia's Garden.
[10:07.700 --> 10:09.340]  Let's see, we're moving on up.
[10:09.340 --> 10:12.860]  There is some cannabis in here.
[10:12.860 --> 10:16.860]  Two small nugs, probably a good gram of weed from Mile High Dispensary.
[10:16.860 --> 10:19.540]  This is some New York City Diesel.
[10:19.540 --> 10:22.020]  It looks like I approve so far.
[10:22.020 --> 10:26.260]  It's in like a vacuum sealed bag, so I can't smell it, but it looks quality.
[10:26.260 --> 10:27.260]  It's frosty.
[10:27.260 --> 10:28.260]  It's really good.
[10:28.260 --> 10:29.260]  I smoked it last night.
[10:29.260 --> 10:30.260]  Yeah, we'll leave that on the table.
[10:30.260 --> 10:31.260]  Lindsay smoked some of it last night.
[10:31.260 --> 10:32.260]  What'd you think?
[10:32.260 --> 10:33.260]  Did you get high?
[10:33.260 --> 10:35.780]  Yeah, actually I had that as the first half of the joint, and then I had like the second
[10:35.780 --> 10:39.420]  half of the joint is something else, and it went out after the first half of the joint,
[10:39.420 --> 10:41.100]  and I just left it that way.
[10:41.100 --> 10:42.100]  You're just happy with that?
[10:42.100 --> 10:43.100]  Yeah.
[10:43.100 --> 10:44.100]  Nice.
[10:44.100 --> 10:45.100]  All right.
[10:45.100 --> 10:46.500]  Well, I know that New York City Diesel is one of Mike's favorite, or at least the sour
[10:46.500 --> 10:47.500]  diesel.
[10:47.500 --> 10:49.620]  It's way up on my list, any of the New York diesels.
[10:49.620 --> 10:50.620]  All right.
[10:50.620 --> 10:53.980]  Well, if you guys want to smoke that or the pre-roll, whichever you feel, there might
[10:53.980 --> 10:57.340]  be a pipe here somewhere that might be clean, and that little pipe cover will make this
[10:57.340 --> 10:58.340]  shit happen.
[10:58.340 --> 10:59.340]  We'll find a way.
[10:59.340 --> 11:00.340]  All right.
[11:00.340 --> 11:01.340]  Then moving on up the ladder, it's like Christmas.
[11:01.340 --> 11:02.500]  The gifts just keep getting better.
[11:02.500 --> 11:10.060]  Our friends at Incredibles Extract threw down a half a gram of Sour Band 09 Fresh Frozen,
[11:10.060 --> 11:11.780]  so it's live resin concentrate.
[11:11.780 --> 11:14.220]  It was kind of like a sappy shatter.
[11:14.220 --> 11:15.700]  Sorry, you guys, I'm burping.
[11:15.700 --> 11:16.700]  Excuse me.
[11:16.700 --> 11:18.660]  So clear, so gorgeous.
[11:18.660 --> 11:19.660]  It tasted so amazing.
[11:19.660 --> 11:20.660]  It was so delicious.
[11:20.660 --> 11:23.660]  It was a half a gram, so it was incredible.
[11:23.660 --> 11:26.100]  Oh, that's so cheesy, but it's accurate.
[11:26.100 --> 11:30.620]  I was a half a gram, so I basically did it all in one dab, because that's how I am, but
[11:30.740 --> 11:34.540]  I inhaled, and I started to blow it out, and I was like, oh, that tastes so good, and I
[11:34.540 --> 11:39.940]  tried to catch my exhale so that I could exhale real slowly and just savor all of that dab
[11:39.940 --> 11:41.860]  flavor, because it was so tasty.
[11:41.860 --> 11:44.700]  So shout out to Incredibles Extracts.
[11:44.700 --> 11:45.700]  Shout out to Derek.
[11:45.700 --> 11:46.700]  That shit was delicious.
[11:46.700 --> 11:47.700]  I approve.
[11:47.700 --> 11:49.900]  That's a great thing to throw in a gift bag for a VIP.
[11:49.900 --> 11:51.180]  I really like that.
[11:51.180 --> 11:52.180]  Yes.
[11:52.180 --> 11:53.180]  Thank you.
[11:53.180 --> 11:58.880]  Then my next favorite in here was from Gaia's Garden Cannabis Creations.
[11:58.920 --> 12:01.720]  This was a caramel apple double karma edible.
[12:01.720 --> 12:07.080]  This had 200 milligrams of THC and 20 milligrams of CBD, and in this little package, it's one
[12:07.080 --> 12:10.400]  of these, like the pop top ... Oh, I'm trying to pop it.
[12:10.400 --> 12:11.400]  There you go.
[12:11.400 --> 12:12.800]  One of these pop top containers.
[12:12.800 --> 12:17.480]  There were two Tootsie Roll size and shape products, and they're wrapped in cellophane.
[12:17.480 --> 12:18.680]  One of them was green.
[12:18.680 --> 12:19.880]  It was the apple.
[12:19.880 --> 12:23.520]  The other one was caramel colored, and it was obviously the caramel.
[12:23.520 --> 12:25.460]  I took a little nibble off the apple.
[12:25.460 --> 12:26.460]  It was fucking delicious.
[12:26.460 --> 12:29.100]  This is like sour apple Jolly Ranchers.
[12:29.100 --> 12:30.100]  It tastes really good.
[12:30.100 --> 12:35.260]  Then I nibbled off the caramel, and it was good, but not my favorite kind of caramel
[12:35.260 --> 12:36.260]  ever.
[12:36.260 --> 12:40.540]  It was a little bit milky, maybe, might be the description, but then I pinched a little
[12:40.540 --> 12:42.500]  of both off and threw them both in my mouth.
[12:42.500 --> 12:46.060]  When you mix that apple and that caramel together, oh, it was fucking delicious.
[12:46.060 --> 12:47.540]  This edible is really good.
[12:47.540 --> 12:51.020]  200 milligrams of THC, 20 milligrams of CBD.
[12:51.020 --> 12:55.820]  In a shop, this probably would have been a $20, $18, $20 edible.
[12:55.860 --> 12:56.860]  It was delicious, and I approve.
[12:56.860 --> 12:58.860]  Shout out to Gaia's Garden.
[12:58.860 --> 13:01.180]  I really liked that.
[13:01.180 --> 13:03.300]  Then my favorite thing in the bag, this is the last thing in the bag, and then we'll
[13:03.300 --> 13:07.260]  move on because I've been going for way longer than I wanted to on this.
[13:07.260 --> 13:10.140]  I was surprised to see this, Dutch Girl Cannabis Seeds.
[13:10.140 --> 13:12.360]  There is a six pack.
[13:12.360 --> 13:15.660]  This is all packaged up properly for Colorado retail.
[13:15.660 --> 13:17.180]  This could be on the shelf.
[13:17.180 --> 13:18.740]  I heard that this was available.
[13:18.740 --> 13:21.980]  This actual product was available at a local dispensary.
[13:21.980 --> 13:24.260]  This is a strain called The Animal.
[13:24.260 --> 13:29.180]  It's 100% sativa, and it is a cross of Jabberwocky and Ghost Train Haze.
[13:29.180 --> 13:30.580]  I got a six pack of seeds.
[13:30.580 --> 13:34.500]  We may have to grow those in the future here and see what comes of this.
[13:34.500 --> 13:35.500]  Shout out to Hunt.
[13:35.500 --> 13:36.700]  Shout out to everybody from The Secret Sesh.
[13:36.700 --> 13:37.700]  Shout out to Miles.
[13:37.700 --> 13:41.180]  Shout out to Adam L. Shout out to DJ Juggie.
[13:41.180 --> 13:43.020]  Everybody treats me like a VIP.
[13:43.020 --> 13:45.260]  We've gone to so many sessions that everybody knows us now.
[13:45.260 --> 13:46.260]  They see us.
[13:46.260 --> 13:47.260]  They high five us when they walk in.
[13:47.260 --> 13:48.260]  They know who we are.
[13:48.260 --> 13:49.260]  I know who they are.
[13:49.260 --> 13:50.260]  It's really fun.
[13:50.260 --> 13:51.260]  Shout out to The Secret Sesh.
[13:51.260 --> 13:53.260]  We should move on from that because we've been going for a really long time.
[13:54.260 --> 13:58.780]  Shout out to fucking Lindsey and Bobo and Brett and all the people that just let me
[13:58.780 --> 13:59.780]  come kick it with them.
[13:59.780 --> 14:01.380]  When I got there, the party was already started.
[14:01.380 --> 14:05.060]  When I walked in, everyone's like, scoot over, make room for Rasta Jeff.
[14:05.060 --> 14:07.940]  Everybody had like, Bobo had a gift for me.
[14:07.940 --> 14:09.700]  Brett had part two of the gift for me.
[14:09.700 --> 14:10.980]  So they're like, come here, try the gift.
[14:10.980 --> 14:14.460]  And then there was a podcast listener sitting there who I only know you by your Instagram
[14:14.460 --> 14:15.460]  name.
[14:15.460 --> 14:16.860]  I cannot think of your real name right now, but he was sitting there and he's like, bro,
[14:16.860 --> 14:17.860]  what's up?
[14:17.860 --> 14:18.860]  And he wanted to shake my hand right away.
[14:18.860 --> 14:22.060]  Johnny B from No Goo wanted to run over and shake my hand right away.
[14:22.060 --> 14:24.620]  Jason Margulies wanted to come over and say what's up and get a hug.
[14:24.620 --> 14:25.620]  So shout out to...
[14:25.620 --> 14:26.620]  Oh, Jason.
[14:26.620 --> 14:27.620]  Big shout out to Jason.
[14:27.620 --> 14:28.620]  Yeah, he keeps it moving.
[14:28.620 --> 14:29.620]  That dude's always on the move.
[14:29.620 --> 14:30.620]  Such a cool brother.
[14:30.620 --> 14:31.780]  I have to really quick.
[14:31.780 --> 14:33.460]  Jason did the funniest thing.
[14:33.460 --> 14:35.580]  He was telling me how much he loves OGs.
[14:35.580 --> 14:40.260]  So I brought him this huge dab of some OG 18 that I had.
[14:40.260 --> 14:42.700]  And I forgot a carb cap.
[14:42.700 --> 14:45.700]  I had heated the nail and everything for him and I forgot a carb cap.
[14:45.700 --> 14:47.980]  So as he's taking the dab, I'm like, Jason, I'm horrid.
[14:47.980 --> 14:50.660]  I forgot a carb cap.
[14:50.660 --> 14:57.220]  There was the countertop that was like granite and he goes underneath it and caps it, like
[14:57.220 --> 15:03.220]  moves himself up and down and caps it with a corner of like the countertop.
[15:03.220 --> 15:06.500]  Yeah, and then just exhale and hands back to the rig and he goes, thanks.
[15:06.500 --> 15:07.500]  That was great.
[15:07.500 --> 15:08.820]  I was like, Jason, you're my hero.
[15:08.820 --> 15:12.140]  I'm glad to see that the MacGyver spirit of the community is alive.
[15:12.140 --> 15:13.140]  Yes, absolutely.
[15:13.140 --> 15:16.100]  Big shout out to Jason for just being awesome.
[15:16.100 --> 15:19.380]  It's awesome walking into an event and being treated like a fucking rock star.
[15:19.380 --> 15:20.380]  Yeah, absolutely.
[15:21.100 --> 15:26.340]  I wish somebody would have told the people at the door who I was, but I wasn't on any
[15:26.340 --> 15:27.340]  list or anything.
[15:27.340 --> 15:28.500]  Hunt told me, just come through.
[15:28.500 --> 15:29.500]  I got you.
[15:29.500 --> 15:31.420]  And so when I got there, like, you're not on any list.
[15:31.420 --> 15:33.140]  And I was like, I know, go, go.
[15:33.140 --> 15:34.140]  I know Hunt though.
[15:34.140 --> 15:35.140]  And like, we don't care.
[15:35.140 --> 15:38.300]  I was like, no, but for real, if I tell Hunt, you turn me away, he's going to be fucking
[15:38.300 --> 15:39.300]  pissed.
[15:39.300 --> 15:40.300]  You better go let him know I'm here.
[15:40.300 --> 15:42.420]  And the guy came back, he's like, you're all square to go, bro.
[15:42.420 --> 15:43.420]  I'm sorry.
[15:43.420 --> 15:45.580]  I was like, yeah, dude, like I'm not trying to be a dick.
[15:45.580 --> 15:47.580]  Like Hunt told me personally, show up.
[15:47.580 --> 15:49.580]  Do you want to see my text messages?
[15:49.780 --> 15:53.780]  I'll even delete his name so it shows up his number and you can compare it to yours.
[15:53.780 --> 15:56.820]  Yeah, that's pretty close to being like, you just want to read my messages, dude.
[15:56.820 --> 15:57.820]  But no, so they let me in.
[15:57.820 --> 15:59.460]  But yeah, I got in, got to have a good ass time.
[15:59.460 --> 16:02.700]  I don't think I left that one seat other than to take a piss once or twice.
[16:02.700 --> 16:04.100]  Shout out for the nachos.
[16:04.100 --> 16:05.100]  Thank you.
[16:05.100 --> 16:06.100]  I needed that.
[16:06.100 --> 16:07.100]  Oh yeah, bro, I did too.
[16:07.100 --> 16:09.380]  I'm sitting there taking dabs and I look up and Lindsay's like, I got nachos.
[16:09.380 --> 16:11.180]  I got them vegetarian so you could eat some.
[16:11.180 --> 16:13.700]  And I was like, damn, I'm going to eat all those jalapenos on there.
[16:13.700 --> 16:14.700]  Yeah, I don't like jalapenos.
[16:14.700 --> 16:15.700]  So you...
[16:15.700 --> 16:16.700]  Perfect.
[16:16.700 --> 16:17.700]  That was, yeah.
[16:17.700 --> 16:18.700]  All right.
[16:18.820 --> 16:21.940]  And the gift that Bobo made for me.
[16:21.940 --> 16:22.980]  There is a new thing.
[16:22.980 --> 16:26.700]  Let's talk about this new thing and then we'll actually get to the main topic of this podcast.
[16:26.700 --> 16:27.800]  The new trend.
[16:27.800 --> 16:30.980]  So I've been talking about turps here in Colorado a whole bunch.
[16:30.980 --> 16:34.060]  In my hand, I've got a half dram vial.
[16:34.060 --> 16:36.700]  That's a small vial, those small vials with the screw on lid.
[16:36.700 --> 16:39.060]  I've got the shorty one.
[16:39.060 --> 16:42.020]  It's some ghost rain haze, liquid turps.
[16:42.020 --> 16:47.020]  My friend Tim from New Mexico, my friends Tim and Charlie showed up from New Mexico
[16:47.180 --> 16:49.840]  with this device that looked like a large pipette.
[16:49.840 --> 16:54.420]  It's real skinny on one end and it tapers and gets thicker at the other end.
[16:54.420 --> 16:59.820]  It's got like a mouthpiece made onto it and they were dunking it into the turps and then
[16:59.820 --> 17:02.860]  letting the excess drip off back into the container.
[17:02.860 --> 17:08.020]  And then without any fire, you keep it tipped down like you would a straw and you just draw
[17:08.020 --> 17:10.540]  through, they call it a turp straw.
[17:10.540 --> 17:12.940]  Just draw right through it with no heat while it's cool.
[17:12.940 --> 17:19.260]  You pull air through it and you can taste the turps incredibly strong.
[17:19.260 --> 17:23.380]  And we were able to put what I would normally dunk onto a dab.
[17:23.380 --> 17:27.640]  Four people took two good draws off of it before the flavor went away.
[17:27.640 --> 17:31.020]  And I don't know that I got any head change because I was already high and we're smoking
[17:31.020 --> 17:36.460]  rosin and stuff, but it's an incredible way to experience the flavor and the essence of
[17:36.460 --> 17:40.300]  the turps without any fire or without any waste.
[17:40.300 --> 17:41.460]  I really thought it was cool.
[17:42.460 --> 17:47.020]  I was talking about this to Bobo who is now learning how to blow glass, who's coming along
[17:47.020 --> 17:48.020]  super fucking quickly.
[17:48.020 --> 17:49.900]  You guys, if you could see what he's doing, I don't want to talk about it.
[17:49.900 --> 17:50.900]  I don't want to spill his beans.
[17:50.900 --> 17:51.900]  He's got an idea.
[17:51.900 --> 17:54.500]  He's got a project that I think is really cool.
[17:54.500 --> 17:55.500]  It's the new shit.
[17:55.500 --> 17:56.500]  It is the new thing.
[17:56.500 --> 17:59.300]  I think this guy's going to kill it, but he made me a turp straw.
[17:59.300 --> 18:02.740]  So shout out to Bobo for the new sip and turp straw.
[18:02.740 --> 18:04.380]  It's got some red, gold and green line work.
[18:04.380 --> 18:06.500]  It's got a little Colorado millie.
[18:06.500 --> 18:07.500]  Is that a millie?
[18:07.500 --> 18:08.500]  Is that what that is?
[18:08.500 --> 18:09.500]  It's an implosion.
[18:09.500 --> 18:10.500]  It's a millie.
[18:10.540 --> 18:14.020]  It's a flower implosion, but he did it with the Colorado emblem.
[18:14.020 --> 18:15.660]  Yeah, it's really sweet.
[18:15.660 --> 18:16.740]  I really appreciate it.
[18:16.740 --> 18:19.020]  He's making a modification to it because it's a new product.
[18:19.020 --> 18:22.620]  He's going to modify it and perfect it for me, but he's making a little modification
[18:22.620 --> 18:24.060]  that I requested, but shout out for that.
[18:24.060 --> 18:28.100]  I totally appreciate that, but you're going to see more people taking cold sip turps at
[18:28.100 --> 18:29.900]  events and things in the future here.
[18:29.900 --> 18:32.740]  I think it's going to be something that we'll catch on.
[18:32.740 --> 18:39.180]  Also I owe a shout out to a glass artist who's Cameron Reed.
[18:39.180 --> 18:40.180]  That's hard to remember.
[18:40.860 --> 18:41.860]  I knew the name.
[18:41.860 --> 18:44.220]  I just had to say it slowly, which is funny because we'll talk about this, but shout out
[18:44.220 --> 18:45.220]  to Cameron Reed Glass.
[18:45.220 --> 18:47.820]  I'll save that for another episode because that's going to get long.
[18:47.820 --> 18:52.980]  Let's work on some of the main topics of this podcast.
[18:52.980 --> 18:56.420]  Let's quickly go through the band names.
[18:56.420 --> 19:02.300]  In Oregon, they have medical marijuana available and they have recently banned some of the
[19:02.300 --> 19:03.300]  names.
[19:03.300 --> 19:04.300]  I've got to-
[19:04.300 --> 19:12.420]  They legalized marijuana for all adults a year and a half ago and they're just now getting
[19:12.420 --> 19:15.420]  through to implementing regulations.
[19:15.420 --> 19:19.700]  They've had stores and zoning for a minute.
[19:19.700 --> 19:24.060]  One of the new regulations is some common strain names are going away in the state of
[19:24.060 --> 19:25.060]  Oregon.
[19:25.060 --> 19:26.060]  I've got a short article.
[19:26.060 --> 19:29.140]  I'm not going to read all of it because the second half of the article is not even related
[19:29.140 --> 19:31.020]  to anything involved in what this is.
[19:31.020 --> 19:32.380]  They just ramble on about some stuff.
[19:32.460 --> 19:37.100]  This comes from the Oregonian and the headline says, no more Girl Scout cookies and other
[19:37.100 --> 19:42.340]  popular names on pot packaging state says, and this is by Noel Crombie.
[19:42.340 --> 19:45.860]  And the article goes like this, popular names such as Girl Scout cookies and Charlotte's
[19:45.860 --> 19:50.700]  Web won't be allowed on the labeling and packaging of medical and recreational marijuana in Oregon
[19:50.700 --> 19:53.580]  under rules approved by the state Friday.
[19:53.580 --> 19:58.180]  The Oregon Liquor Control Commission said it had reviewed about 500 marijuana strain
[19:58.180 --> 20:02.140]  names and identified about 20 that may appeal to children.
[20:02.900 --> 20:06.620]  The commissioners sought the rule change after hearing from members of the public who objected
[20:06.620 --> 20:08.140]  to the child friendly names.
[20:08.140 --> 20:10.580]  I'm going to interject here.
[20:10.580 --> 20:12.420]  The fuck is the kid doing in the dispensary anyway?
[20:12.420 --> 20:14.700]  How's the kid going to see that on there?
[20:14.700 --> 20:18.700]  I think they're talking about on the packaging at home when it's around.
[20:18.700 --> 20:20.460]  Okay, I'll give it that.
[20:20.460 --> 20:21.460]  One of the arguments.
[20:21.460 --> 20:23.260]  That's what I'm here for.
[20:23.260 --> 20:25.620]  That's fucked up that Lindsay is the voice of reason today.
[20:25.620 --> 20:30.100]  Yeah, because I, there are my children's.
[20:30.100 --> 20:33.980]  One of the arguments, the anti-pop people have really been able to get legislatures
[20:33.980 --> 20:36.060]  around the country to listen to.
[20:36.060 --> 20:40.820]  And so when we get to the Colorado rules in a minute, the reasons they were implemented
[20:40.820 --> 20:42.340]  are essentially identical.
[20:42.340 --> 20:43.340]  And I agree.
[20:43.340 --> 20:45.700]  We need to keep cannabis products out of the hands of children.
[20:45.700 --> 20:46.860]  That's not something that's cool.
[20:46.860 --> 20:47.860]  I don't want your kids.
[20:47.860 --> 20:51.980]  Unless it is a medical condition that they need it for.
[20:51.980 --> 20:52.980]  Right.
[20:52.980 --> 20:53.980]  Right.
[20:53.980 --> 20:54.980]  Well, I just don't want my kid taking my cannabis.
[20:54.980 --> 20:55.980]  I was going to say somebody else's, but I'll put this in on me.
[20:55.980 --> 20:56.980]  Kids should not be using it recreationally.
[20:56.980 --> 21:01.740]  I don't want my child getting access to my Schumet bar and taking this to school and
[21:01.740 --> 21:06.900]  giving it to your kid and your kid fucking freaking out at school and you suing me and
[21:06.900 --> 21:08.620]  the school getting mad at me and my kid.
[21:08.620 --> 21:09.620]  That shit doesn't need to happen.
[21:09.620 --> 21:10.620]  Don't put that evil on me, Ricky Bobby.
[21:10.620 --> 21:11.620]  That's been incredibly rare in Colorado.
[21:11.620 --> 21:12.620]  Did you just call me Ricky Bobby?
[21:12.620 --> 21:16.020]  Yeah, I said don't put that evil on me, Ricky Bobby, because you said I'd have a kid.
[21:16.020 --> 21:17.020]  I want to go fast.
[21:17.020 --> 21:20.500]  All right, I'm going to get back into this article before we totally train wreck this
[21:20.500 --> 21:21.500]  bitch.
[21:21.500 --> 21:24.500]  So there's some strain names being banned in Oregon now.
[21:24.500 --> 21:25.500]  Yes.
[21:25.500 --> 21:26.500]  Don't worry.
[21:26.500 --> 21:28.220]  The strains themselves haven't been banned.
[21:28.220 --> 21:29.220]  Right, right.
[21:29.220 --> 21:30.220]  Well, yeah, yeah, completely.
[21:30.220 --> 21:34.180]  There've been some breeders have been talking on Facebook forums and such about this.
[21:34.180 --> 21:37.940]  The article goes, the rule approved one day before the state licenses recreational marijuana
[21:37.940 --> 21:42.980]  retailers prohibits words that refer to products that are commonly associated with minors or
[21:42.980 --> 21:45.420]  marketed by minors.
[21:45.420 --> 21:48.620]  Chairman of the commission called the new requirement a common sense approach.
[21:48.620 --> 21:53.060]  If you walk through a toy store and you can identify things that are strain names, those
[21:53.060 --> 21:54.460]  are probably inappropriate.
[21:54.460 --> 21:57.460]  He said, it's also as simple as that.
[21:57.460 --> 22:02.620]  The agency also won't allow strain names that refer to illicit drugs such as LSD and blow.
[22:02.620 --> 22:04.860]  LSD is just lemon sour diesel.
[22:04.860 --> 22:08.900]  It's just way easier to fucking right and blows a stupid fucking name for a strain name.
[22:08.900 --> 22:09.900]  So cool.
[22:09.900 --> 22:11.220]  I'm gonna more green crack either.
[22:11.220 --> 22:12.780]  Yeah, we'll get to that list.
[22:12.780 --> 22:16.580]  A list of outlawed proper names.
[22:16.580 --> 22:22.020]  Girl Scout cookies, grape, a candy land, Charlotte's Web Cinderella, Doctor Who, Bubblicious Smurf,
[22:22.020 --> 22:25.940]  Bruce Banner, Death Star, Skywalker and Jedi Kush.
[22:25.940 --> 22:29.020]  Those strains will still be allowed in Oregon's recreational shops.
[22:29.020 --> 22:34.180]  Retailers and marijuana producers and processors can use initials or some other shorthand reference
[22:34.180 --> 22:36.100]  instead of the full strain name.
[22:36.100 --> 22:37.100]  Okay.
[22:37.100 --> 22:38.100]  Yeah.
[22:38.100 --> 22:39.100]  So let's see.
[22:39.100 --> 22:40.100]  It doesn't have to get renamed or anything.
[22:40.100 --> 22:41.100]  All right.
[22:41.100 --> 22:42.380]  This isn't as bad as I thought.
[22:42.380 --> 22:43.380]  Right.
[22:43.380 --> 22:46.700]  Well, yeah, but it's pretty gentle, but it's also pretty silly.
[22:46.700 --> 22:49.700]  It is kind of silly that you can't have a Skywalker or Jedi Kush.
[22:49.700 --> 22:50.700]  Okay.
[22:50.700 --> 22:54.900]  I mean, I don't know how they're doing it in Oregon, but in Colorado, it's block printed
[22:54.900 --> 22:56.220]  in black lettering.
[22:56.220 --> 22:59.900]  That's how the strain name gets printed on pretty much every product that leaves a legal
[22:59.900 --> 23:00.900]  dispensary.
[23:00.900 --> 23:02.820]  I mean, it's never down the front.
[23:02.820 --> 23:05.140]  Like the Toys R Us logo is different colors.
[23:05.140 --> 23:07.340]  What's the really cute font for kids eyes?
[23:07.340 --> 23:13.580]  It's just computer printed on a packaging label with a shitload of other information
[23:13.580 --> 23:14.580]  on it.
[23:14.580 --> 23:15.580]  Okay.
[23:15.580 --> 23:18.260]  Let me be the voice of reason again.
[23:18.260 --> 23:24.020]  We are still able to legally buy weed in the shop.
[23:24.020 --> 23:26.060]  So is it that big of a deal?
[23:26.060 --> 23:27.860]  I forget how short of a time you've been here.
[23:27.860 --> 23:31.260]  You got to get used to it so you can start bitching about all the little impractical
[23:31.260 --> 23:32.260]  things.
[23:32.260 --> 23:34.860]  No, listen, I completely understand where you guys are coming from.
[23:34.860 --> 23:36.260]  No, because you're a hundred percent right.
[23:36.260 --> 23:44.820]  I just feel like in the marijuana industry and community, we have such bigger battles
[23:44.940 --> 23:48.940]  to be fighting than the fact that we can't use the name Girl Scout Cookies.
[23:48.940 --> 23:49.940]  I'm not being mean.
[23:49.940 --> 23:54.140]  I'm just saying like, to me, it just feels like we can all buy legal weed.
[23:54.140 --> 23:55.220]  Like I get it.
[23:55.220 --> 23:57.220]  It's a bummer and it's a big deal.
[23:57.220 --> 24:05.140]  But at the end of the day, it's not like you have to rename the strain to be, you know,
[24:05.140 --> 24:09.060]  something completely ridiculous that that's nothing to do with cookies.
[24:09.060 --> 24:10.060]  You know what I'm saying?
[24:10.060 --> 24:13.660]  Like they're not saying you can't use any cookie name or any.
[24:13.660 --> 24:19.700]  They took like 20 names out of 500, which in the grand scheme of things is probably
[24:19.700 --> 24:20.700]  so many.
[24:20.700 --> 24:22.700]  Do you think Bounty Killer would make this list?
[24:22.700 --> 24:23.700]  Probably.
[24:23.700 --> 24:26.460]  Is the Bounty Killer not allowed?
[24:26.460 --> 24:32.940]  I feel like a lot of Colorado strains would be pulled on that list.
[24:32.940 --> 24:38.220]  I was thinking about the different ones we've cared or I've had on a shelf in front of me
[24:38.220 --> 24:40.340]  while I've been working in the legal industry.
[24:40.340 --> 24:42.900]  And I think about maybe 20% of them.
[24:43.140 --> 24:45.340]  Oddly enough, Green Crack is not on this list.
[24:45.340 --> 24:46.340]  Yeah.
[24:46.340 --> 24:47.340]  About 20.
[24:47.340 --> 24:50.260]  When I read the list, I was like, well, there's a bunch missing.
[24:50.260 --> 24:53.140]  Like if this is the criteria.
[24:53.140 --> 24:56.940]  So maybe they just got the super blatant ones and they left the others.
[24:56.940 --> 24:58.340]  Girls who have cookies make sense.
[24:58.340 --> 24:59.340]  For sure.
[24:59.340 --> 25:02.300]  I was that when you said that, I was like, oh, that makes absolute sense.
[25:02.300 --> 25:03.300]  That is children.
[25:03.300 --> 25:05.180]  That's a children organization.
[25:05.180 --> 25:07.100]  Grape Ape Candyland, Charlotte's Web.
[25:07.100 --> 25:08.100]  That's all children's stuff.
[25:08.100 --> 25:09.100]  Charlotte's Web is a kid's book.
[25:09.100 --> 25:12.220]  Grape Ape is a kid's character.
[25:12.540 --> 25:17.500]  There's a company that spent a fortune in like half a decade marketing Charlotte's Web
[25:17.500 --> 25:18.500]  around the country.
[25:18.500 --> 25:19.500]  Right.
[25:19.500 --> 25:20.500]  Yep.
[25:20.500 --> 25:21.500]  Fucking Cinderella.
[25:21.500 --> 25:22.500]  Oh, absolutely.
[25:22.500 --> 25:23.500]  So Girl Scout Cookies, we're just going to call that GSC.
[25:23.500 --> 25:25.580]  And it also says derivative strains.
[25:25.580 --> 25:28.860]  You can't use platinum Girl Scouts or Thin Mints either.
[25:28.860 --> 25:31.100]  So then you probably can't use Do-Si-Do's.
[25:31.100 --> 25:32.100]  Do-Si-Do's are banned.
[25:32.100 --> 25:33.100]  Well, yeah.
[25:33.100 --> 25:34.100]  Probably.
[25:34.100 --> 25:35.100]  But yeah.
[25:35.100 --> 25:39.700]  I saw something the other day that was Snickerdoodle was the strain name.
[25:39.700 --> 25:41.660]  The fruit names.
[25:42.100 --> 25:46.220]  I mean, how many different ones vaguely meet like an item a kid might have for dessert
[25:46.220 --> 25:47.220]  also?
[25:47.220 --> 25:48.220]  Right.
[25:48.220 --> 25:49.220]  Sour Lemon Sherbert.
[25:49.220 --> 25:53.860]  Doctor Who is taken because it's a fictional character currently marketed to children.
[25:53.860 --> 25:56.500]  Basically any fictional character.
[25:56.500 --> 26:00.820]  When I first read this, I was like, well, some jackass made an Obama Kush.
[26:00.820 --> 26:05.100]  Is that gone too because kids know the president?
[26:05.100 --> 26:06.980]  I mean, how far are they going with this particular...
[26:06.980 --> 26:10.940]  And that's why I have an issue with it because as a regulation, it's a little bizarre.
[26:11.940 --> 26:15.540]  You can ban cartoons from the name or from the logo.
[26:15.540 --> 26:20.740]  You can do a lot of other things to make sure that the products don't target children.
[26:20.740 --> 26:24.180]  But banning stuff that's going to be like just words in black print, like some of it
[26:24.180 --> 26:28.300]  makes a little bit of sense, but some of it's just going to be a regulatory pain in the
[26:28.300 --> 26:29.740]  ass down the road for sure.
[26:29.740 --> 26:31.340]  Just more hoops to jump through.
[26:31.340 --> 26:33.900]  Just more bitching and complaining for them to do about campus.
[26:33.900 --> 26:36.220]  A lot of it's subjective.
[26:36.220 --> 26:40.580]  And that's what makes it a regulatory issue in my mind.
[26:40.580 --> 26:45.340]  We'll get to some Colorado rules here in just a second that it's not subjective.
[26:45.340 --> 26:46.340]  Let's jump right to that then.
[26:46.340 --> 26:49.380]  That's a good segue, Mike, since we're like 27 minutes in.
[26:49.380 --> 26:50.380]  Let's get to this.
[26:50.380 --> 26:54.380]  About halfway through the show, it's a perfect time to move on to my favorite topic of the
[26:54.380 --> 26:55.380]  show.
[26:55.380 --> 27:01.260]  Colorado recently, until a few days ago, until the first, I was allowed to walk into a dispensary,
[27:01.260 --> 27:06.060]  a medical dispensary or recreational dispensary, and I was able to buy without any special
[27:06.060 --> 27:07.060]  paperwork.
[27:07.060 --> 27:11.020]  I think to the best of my knowledge, I was allowed to buy two ounces of concentrates.
[27:11.020 --> 27:13.020]  I mean, I could buy two ounces of shatter.
[27:13.020 --> 27:14.300]  Is that correct?
[27:14.300 --> 27:15.300]  Lindsay says yes.
[27:15.300 --> 27:16.300]  Mike, is that correct?
[27:16.300 --> 27:17.300]  Medically?
[27:17.300 --> 27:18.300]  In a medical shop, yes.
[27:18.300 --> 27:19.460]  In a rec shop, just the one.
[27:19.460 --> 27:20.460]  Okay.
[27:20.460 --> 27:23.060]  So in a medical shop, I can get my two ounces because I'm a medical patient.
[27:23.060 --> 27:28.700]  In a recreational shop, I was allowed to buy one ounce of concentrate, which is enough
[27:28.700 --> 27:29.700]  concentrate.
[27:29.700 --> 27:30.700]  That's not a lot of concentrate.
[27:30.700 --> 27:35.700]  I mean, if you're me, I mean, there was fucking two pounds of fucking rosin on this table
[27:35.700 --> 27:42.460]  just a couple of days ago, but an ounce or two is a substantial amount.
[27:42.460 --> 27:46.420]  Now the new rule is no matter who you are, no matter where you're shopping, eight gram
[27:46.420 --> 27:47.420]  limit.
[27:47.420 --> 27:48.420]  The original rule was just basic.
[27:48.420 --> 27:49.420]  I don't think so.
[27:49.420 --> 27:50.740]  On the medical side too?
[27:50.740 --> 27:52.900]  I'm pretty sure that's on the medical side too.
[27:52.900 --> 27:54.420]  I'm pretty sure it's just rec.
[27:54.420 --> 27:56.060]  I'm pretty sure it's just rec.
[27:56.060 --> 28:01.580]  Ah, then the article that I read has misled me and I'm glad you guys have corrected me.
[28:01.580 --> 28:05.700]  I know for a hundred percent sure you can only buy eight grams of concentrate now and
[28:05.700 --> 28:12.360]  there are other rules for edibles and other items that are sold by the milligram like
[28:12.360 --> 28:15.500]  edibles and vape pen cartridges.
[28:15.500 --> 28:18.540]  So if I'm not mistaken, I'm doing this from memory.
[28:18.540 --> 28:19.540]  Everybody else has their phone out.
[28:19.540 --> 28:20.540]  Cheater.
[28:20.540 --> 28:23.540]  Um, no, back check for the audience.
[28:23.540 --> 28:24.820]  I'm fact checking like a motherfucker right now.
[28:24.820 --> 28:26.860]  You keep talking, go slow.
[28:26.860 --> 28:29.620]  Edible and vape pen limit is now 800 milligrams.
[28:29.660 --> 28:32.660]  It used to be 2,800.
[28:32.660 --> 28:41.860]  Um, and concentrate limits are now, was it seven or eight, eight, eight grams a concentrate.
[28:41.860 --> 28:45.260]  Is that edible limit changed on the medical side as well?
[28:45.260 --> 28:49.220]  I don't, I, as far as I know, these are just recreational rules.
[28:49.220 --> 28:54.260]  I think the only thing that changed on the medical side was compliance.
[28:54.260 --> 28:56.540]  Some edible compliance labeling rules.
[28:56.540 --> 28:57.540]  Yeah.
[28:57.540 --> 28:59.620]  Um, imprinting on bars.
[28:59.620 --> 29:00.620]  Yeah.
[29:00.620 --> 29:05.340]  The, um, so the, the, there were two different rule changes in Colorado or three different
[29:05.340 --> 29:06.660]  rule changes in Colorado.
[29:06.660 --> 29:08.700]  One limits what people can buy.
[29:08.700 --> 29:17.060]  Uh, one limits, uh, the shape of certain gummies of edibles in general, edibles period.
[29:17.060 --> 29:20.500]  And uh, but mostly affecting gummies right now market wide.
[29:20.500 --> 29:24.340]  And then the last rule is, um, edibles in Colorado.
[29:24.340 --> 29:29.300]  Now the actual item has to carry a stamp and I actually took notes today.
[29:29.300 --> 29:30.300]  Oh, I can tell you what it is.
[29:30.300 --> 29:37.300]  The Denver post had a, um, an interview with Larry Wolk, the head of the department of
[29:37.300 --> 29:43.980]  uh, Colorado health and environment, the CDPHE and uh, somebody from the top of the MED,
[29:43.980 --> 29:46.660]  the marijuana enforcement division.
[29:46.660 --> 29:50.220]  Um, the edible symbols.
[29:50.220 --> 29:52.380]  Um, there's two exceptions.
[29:52.380 --> 29:57.780]  So like every piece of chocolate has to carry a little, if it's recreational, a yellow diamond
[29:57.780 --> 30:02.220]  with the letters THC exclamation point in it and the medical just has the M right for
[30:02.220 --> 30:03.220]  medical.
[30:03.220 --> 30:04.220]  No.
[30:04.220 --> 30:05.220]  Um, it's the same diamond.
[30:05.220 --> 30:08.220]  Um, it doesn't have to be a color though.
[30:08.220 --> 30:10.860]  Um, and it has to say THC.
[30:10.860 --> 30:13.580]  Oh, they might've dropped the color.
[30:13.580 --> 30:14.860]  That was one of the original things.
[30:14.860 --> 30:18.740]  And people were like, well, how do we make it yellow on a Brownie without frosting or
[30:18.740 --> 30:19.740]  some such.
[30:19.740 --> 30:21.740]  It took a while for some companies to get this implemented.
[30:22.100 --> 30:25.500]  I've seen one company that they just made a disc out of sugar.
[30:25.500 --> 30:26.980]  So it's a hundred percent edible.
[30:26.980 --> 30:30.820]  Um, but it has the logo on it and then they've affixed it to the top of their product with
[30:30.820 --> 30:33.140]  like melted marshmallow.
[30:33.140 --> 30:36.300]  It is weird in practice, but it's pretty tasty.
[30:36.300 --> 30:41.540]  Um, but the only exceptions to carrying that symbol are liquids.
[30:41.540 --> 30:47.820]  Um, the liquids manufacturers managed to get the legislature to see reason and make a specific
[30:47.820 --> 30:50.020]  exception for liquids.
[30:50.020 --> 30:53.580]  Um, so that, you know, you, you can't stamp a liquid.
[30:53.580 --> 30:58.140]  Um, and they were literally taught for a while talking about making it, having gold style
[30:58.140 --> 31:04.620]  show logger floaties that said THC in it, um, or some such, um, or only doing single
[31:04.620 --> 31:07.740]  serving packages of liquids.
[31:07.740 --> 31:12.860]  So it could only come in a 10 milligram serving recreationally, which would pretty much kill
[31:12.860 --> 31:14.820]  recreational liquids.
[31:14.820 --> 31:17.140]  Um, but they carved out an exception.
[31:17.460 --> 31:22.100]  It can still be a hundred milligram liquid container as long as the measuring device
[31:22.100 --> 31:23.900]  is part of that container.
[31:23.900 --> 31:29.820]  Um, and stuff like granola now has to come in single serving packages.
[31:29.820 --> 31:34.540]  Anything that any edible that can't carry the stamp has to come in individually, uh,
[31:34.540 --> 31:38.460]  individual serving size packages with the label affixed to that packaging.
[31:38.460 --> 31:43.700]  Um, so that you can't leave it on a table and somebody come along and pick it up.
[31:43.700 --> 31:44.700]  Okay.
[31:44.700 --> 31:48.780]  Which is a felony in its own right before we came up with the label.
[31:48.780 --> 31:51.380]  Um, it's still a felony with the label.
[31:51.380 --> 31:53.900]  Um, it's like leaving a loaded gun on a table.
[31:53.900 --> 31:58.740]  Like it's, it's wildly inappropriate adult behavior.
[31:58.740 --> 32:02.820]  Um, yeah, that's the basic edible rundown.
[32:02.820 --> 32:07.260]  Did you find a, yes, the article I had to go through three articles to actually find
[32:07.260 --> 32:08.260]  the truth.
[32:08.260 --> 32:10.500]  Uh, medical marijuana will remain unchanged.
[32:10.500 --> 32:11.820]  Only one article said that.
[32:11.940 --> 32:15.860]  Uh, the first article that I was reading was actually sponsored by a dispensary.
[32:15.860 --> 32:18.980]  So they were trying to leave medical marijuana out on purpose, I think because of the way
[32:18.980 --> 32:22.100]  that it was worded, it totally made it look like it was happening all over the board.
[32:22.100 --> 32:28.620]  So I'm glad, I'm glad that the medical market, uh, rec limits, the industry has been talking
[32:28.620 --> 32:30.860]  about this for a year now.
[32:30.860 --> 32:33.700]  Lindsay's been over there committing felonies for the past four days and not knowing it.
[32:33.700 --> 32:35.260]  Not even, it's only the second.
[32:35.260 --> 32:37.900]  So, but I was definitely just me this weekend.
[32:37.900 --> 32:40.700]  So I was the only one committing felonies.
[32:40.700 --> 32:45.780]  A lot of people are sweating this because so far in Colorado, not a single licensed
[32:45.780 --> 32:48.140]  dispensary has screwed up.
[32:48.140 --> 32:54.940]  Um, the purchase limit rule, no one's been cited or fined for, uh, selling over the limit
[32:54.940 --> 32:55.940]  yet.
[32:55.940 --> 32:56.940]  Yeah.
[32:56.940 --> 32:57.940]  It's only been a couple of days.
[32:57.940 --> 33:00.940]  Well, no, we've always had purchase limits.
[33:00.940 --> 33:01.940]  Period.
[33:01.940 --> 33:05.180]  In Colorado, no shop has been cited for that.
[33:05.180 --> 33:08.900]  Um, and that's sort of, it's one of those little random points of pride.
[33:09.660 --> 33:15.100]  For a while, our team, our team ID checks things where we were at 99%, which is unheard
[33:15.100 --> 33:17.020]  of in liquor or tobacco.
[33:17.020 --> 33:18.020]  And we were real proud of that.
[33:18.020 --> 33:23.020]  And then we had one bad round and got knocked down to 92, just like alcohol and tobacco.
[33:23.020 --> 33:24.020]  And that hurt.
[33:24.020 --> 33:27.140]  But they don't even check alcohol and tobacco.
[33:27.140 --> 33:30.820]  They do, but it's not nearly what they do with, with marijuana.
[33:30.820 --> 33:37.140]  They were doing, um, it was a real ID and the person in the ID was wearing a hat and
[33:37.140 --> 33:40.380]  the person checking the ID was supposed to catch that.
[33:40.380 --> 33:45.220]  That was the last ID sting that I heard about, uh, performed on a marijuana store.
[33:45.220 --> 33:46.220]  That's sketchy.
[33:46.220 --> 33:47.220]  That's shady.
[33:47.220 --> 33:48.220]  That's just trying to fuck with us.
[33:48.220 --> 33:51.020]  I know that's checking compliance to the nth degree.
[33:51.020 --> 33:55.940]  Uh, marijuana shops also face, um, 10 times the fine that a tobacco or alcohol retailer
[33:55.940 --> 33:56.940]  would.
[33:56.940 --> 33:57.940]  Of course.
[33:57.940 --> 33:58.940]  Um, it's 10 grand.
[33:58.940 --> 34:03.020]  If you sell cigarettes or alcohol to somebody under age is the possible fine with marijuana.
[34:03.020 --> 34:04.260]  It's a hundred.
[34:04.260 --> 34:05.260]  That could ruin a business.
[34:05.380 --> 34:07.900]  That could just close you down no matter how big your dispensary is.
[34:07.900 --> 34:09.100]  A hundred thousand dollar fine could kill.
[34:09.100 --> 34:10.660]  So I guess that's why you gotta be careful.
[34:10.660 --> 34:11.660]  All right.
[34:11.660 --> 34:13.660]  So now that's why one of the reasons it never happened.
[34:13.660 --> 34:16.700]  Recreational shoppers can now only buy eight grams.
[34:16.700 --> 34:19.460]  Does that mean that people that come to do that, that means the ounce deals are going
[34:19.460 --> 34:20.620]  to go away at the rec shops.
[34:20.620 --> 34:24.380]  No more cheap ounce deals because you can't buy an ounce of hash.
[34:24.380 --> 34:26.180]  You can still buy 28 grams of flour.
[34:26.180 --> 34:27.180]  Yeah.
[34:27.180 --> 34:28.180]  I'm just talking about, yeah.
[34:28.180 --> 34:31.260]  Cheap because I mean, you'd see concentrate deals for like four or 2,500 for a cheap ounce.
[34:31.260 --> 34:33.460]  Well, and there's no, and either.
[34:33.460 --> 34:38.260]  And so you can't get your, your limit in flour and your limit in hash and your limit
[34:38.260 --> 34:39.260]  in edibles.
[34:39.260 --> 34:42.500]  There's actually a chart that's been going around that shows how the breakdown is, how
[34:42.500 --> 34:47.120]  many grams of hash equals how many grams of flour, how many grams of milligrams of edibles
[34:47.120 --> 34:48.460]  equal how many grams of flour.
[34:48.460 --> 34:52.020]  I don't pay attention to the chart cause I'm not working at a bud tender station.
[34:52.020 --> 34:56.560]  There was this great like three month period where bud tenders didn't have to do pointless
[34:56.560 --> 35:02.660]  math in their head all day long, like counting to seven over and over in different fractions,
[35:02.860 --> 35:05.100]  depending on what the order was or whatever.
[35:05.100 --> 35:08.260]  We was just 28 was the limit and it was real simple.
[35:08.260 --> 35:12.620]  And now there's this that they, or we all have to keep in our head that sucks.
[35:12.620 --> 35:14.500]  Just more regulation to follow.
[35:14.500 --> 35:18.820]  Do you think it's just going to make people go to more stores?
[35:18.820 --> 35:19.820]  People that are smurfing.
[35:19.820 --> 35:20.820]  Yeah.
[35:20.820 --> 35:24.780]  But this rule really isn't for them.
[35:24.780 --> 35:25.980]  There hasn't been a lot of that.
[35:25.980 --> 35:30.220]  That's why they just recently upped the out of state purchase limit to an ounce.
[35:30.220 --> 35:31.340]  Okay.
[35:31.340 --> 35:34.580]  When this rule was originally passed, they were talking about out of staters can only
[35:34.580 --> 35:37.260]  buy one and a half grams of hash.
[35:37.260 --> 35:40.900]  Um, I laughed the first time I read it cause I looked down at my case and I was like, everything
[35:40.900 --> 35:42.380]  comes in one gram container.
[35:42.380 --> 35:44.340]  It's like, how are you going to buy it?
[35:44.340 --> 35:48.060]  You can buy one gram or we've got to talk to all our distributors and see if they can
[35:48.060 --> 35:49.060]  do a half Z.
[35:49.060 --> 35:50.060]  Yup.
[35:50.060 --> 35:53.940]  Um, but uh, they hammered it out and then the just recently a couple months ago they
[35:53.940 --> 35:54.940]  upped that limit.
[35:54.940 --> 35:56.540]  So I don't think they're worried about smurfing.
[35:56.540 --> 36:01.260]  They just, somebody in the legislature was like, wait, we let people buy 28 grams a half
[36:01.260 --> 36:04.660]  hash or 280 what was it?
[36:04.660 --> 36:06.940]  2,800 grams of edibles.
[36:06.940 --> 36:11.340]  That's 28 of the, or 280 of the most potent edibles sold in a rec shop.
[36:11.340 --> 36:12.340]  Wow.
[36:12.340 --> 36:13.780]  It's a shit ton of edibles.
[36:13.780 --> 36:14.780]  Yeah.
[36:14.780 --> 36:18.860]  I've seen people leave the spot with fucking bags.
[36:18.860 --> 36:22.140]  I used to have every now and again I'd say, I'll go get you a box.
[36:22.140 --> 36:23.140]  Hold on.
[36:23.140 --> 36:24.580]  I mean it happens throughout the industry.
[36:24.580 --> 36:27.420]  Security would follow them to the car and make sure they got to their car safely cause
[36:27.420 --> 36:29.900]  they had that much product on them.
[36:29.900 --> 36:32.100]  But it happens from time to time.
[36:32.100 --> 36:33.860]  Um, it's just one of those things.
[36:33.860 --> 36:37.820]  And now with these new limits, it's just anybody that's looking to do that, it's just going
[36:37.820 --> 36:39.380]  to have to make more stops.
[36:39.380 --> 36:40.860]  But it's a weird set of rules.
[36:40.860 --> 36:43.700]  Like you can tell it's not the same group of people writing all of these.
[36:43.700 --> 36:46.060]  Can I ask you a completely random question that's off topic?
[36:46.060 --> 36:47.060]  Sure.
[36:47.060 --> 36:48.060]  You guys have both been bud tenders.
[36:48.060 --> 36:50.900]  You have plenty of experience behind the bud counter and ringing people up.
[36:50.900 --> 36:55.900]  What is the largest ticket you have ever rung up a single person for my largest personal
[36:55.900 --> 36:56.900]  ticket?
[36:56.900 --> 36:57.900]  Yeah.
[36:57.900 --> 36:58.900]  It's like 1700.
[36:58.900 --> 36:59.900]  I'm at a rec shop.
[36:59.900 --> 37:00.900]  Yep.
[37:00.900 --> 37:01.900]  Okay.
[37:01.900 --> 37:02.900]  Lins, do you remember?
[37:02.900 --> 37:04.580]  Oh, I know what it is.
[37:04.580 --> 37:05.580]  Do you want to say it?
[37:05.580 --> 37:08.220]  Is it beat Mike 1700 and I'm pretty sure it does.
[37:08.220 --> 37:09.900]  Cause I mean it's a medical shop.
[37:09.900 --> 37:11.140]  You can buy so much more.
[37:11.140 --> 37:12.140]  Yeah.
[37:12.140 --> 37:13.140]  The limits are totally different.
[37:13.140 --> 37:14.140]  Yeah.
[37:14.140 --> 37:15.140]  I just, do I know the purchaser?
[37:15.140 --> 37:18.540]  I can't, I can't do that.
[37:18.540 --> 37:20.500]  She's got different rules than I do.
[37:20.500 --> 37:21.500]  That's true.
[37:21.500 --> 37:25.300]  I just work at like basically a store in the mall are the rules I follow other than the
[37:25.300 --> 37:26.580]  ID checks.
[37:26.580 --> 37:27.740]  She works in a medical shop.
[37:27.740 --> 37:30.700]  She has so many stupid rules.
[37:30.700 --> 37:31.900]  She's going to write down a number.
[37:31.900 --> 37:35.340]  She's going to write it down and we're going to gasp.
[37:35.340 --> 37:37.100]  She just kept typing zeros.
[37:37.100 --> 37:38.100]  What the fuck?
[37:38.100 --> 37:39.100]  Okay.
[37:39.100 --> 37:40.740]  She's got me beat by an order of magnitude folks.
[37:40.740 --> 37:41.980]  It's five digits you guys.
[37:41.980 --> 37:42.980]  Congrats.
[37:42.980 --> 37:43.980]  You kicked the shit out of my order.
[37:43.980 --> 37:44.980]  Cheers girl.
[37:44.980 --> 37:45.980]  Yeah.
[37:45.980 --> 37:46.980]  That's that's that.
[37:46.980 --> 37:47.980]  I hope that came with like a hell of a prize.
[37:47.980 --> 37:52.540]  I was just going to ask if anybody tipped you or took care of you for that.
[37:52.540 --> 37:54.540]  She's shaking her head no and putting the lid back on her bottle.
[37:54.540 --> 37:57.140]  The giant tickets don't often tip.
[37:57.540 --> 37:58.540]  Yeah.
[37:58.540 --> 37:59.540]  No.
[37:59.540 --> 38:01.220]  Those frugal people is how they have all that extra money because they don't fucking
[38:01.220 --> 38:02.220]  tip.
[38:02.220 --> 38:03.220]  Yeah.
[38:03.220 --> 38:04.220]  It just makes your blood tender.
[38:04.220 --> 38:05.220]  Yeah.
[38:05.220 --> 38:06.220]  Shout out to Molly.
[38:06.220 --> 38:07.220]  Where was Molly?
[38:07.220 --> 38:08.860]  Molly was not at the secret sesh.
[38:08.860 --> 38:09.860]  That's weird.
[38:09.860 --> 38:10.860]  We didn't see Molly.
[38:10.860 --> 38:11.860]  I just realized that Molly didn't show up.
[38:11.860 --> 38:14.740]  Molly was at a concert or something like that.
[38:14.740 --> 38:15.740]  I hope Molly had fun.
[38:15.740 --> 38:18.260]  She was hiking somewhere because I saw some Instagram pictures.
[38:18.260 --> 38:19.260]  She was up on top of some crazy big rock all by herself.
[38:19.260 --> 38:20.260]  She went for a big birthday hike.
[38:20.260 --> 38:21.260]  Shout out to you girl.
[38:21.260 --> 38:22.260]  Happy birthday Molly.
[38:22.260 --> 38:23.260]  Big birthday hikes are awesome.
[38:23.260 --> 38:24.260]  We're late but happy birthday.
[38:24.260 --> 38:25.260]  We still love you.
[38:25.260 --> 38:26.260]  Hope you had a great time.
[38:26.380 --> 38:30.340]  Mike, did you get to cover all of your edible stuff that you wanted to talk about?
[38:30.340 --> 38:32.500]  I think I hit all the new rule changes.
[38:32.500 --> 38:34.180]  We covered the purchase limit.
[38:34.180 --> 38:35.180]  We covered that-
[38:35.180 --> 38:37.820]  I was under the impression that everybody-
[38:37.820 --> 38:40.140]  Oh, and shapes are changing.
[38:40.140 --> 38:47.500]  You can no longer do human shapes, animal shapes, fruit shapes.
[38:47.500 --> 38:49.860]  Anything that resembles a candy that's on the shelf.
[38:49.860 --> 38:50.860]  Yeah.
[38:50.860 --> 38:55.420]  Or anything that's identical to its non-medicated market counterpart.
[38:56.380 --> 39:01.460]  All of your gummies are now squares, which works out well because it's really easy to
[39:01.460 --> 39:05.500]  imprint the new symbol into a square.
[39:05.500 --> 39:06.500]  What else?
[39:06.500 --> 39:08.580]  How are they handling the sodas?
[39:08.580 --> 39:12.020]  You can still do 100 milligram beverages in the rec market.
[39:12.020 --> 39:19.780]  The container has to carry the new label and the dosing instrument.
[39:19.780 --> 39:25.340]  It has to come with a NyQuil medicine top so that you can dose out your 10 milligram
[39:25.340 --> 39:28.420]  dose and do weed shots with your friends.
[39:28.420 --> 39:29.420]  That's pretty funny.
[39:29.420 --> 39:32.140]  That was the tagline when I was selling those all day.
[39:32.140 --> 39:34.620]  Have you ever drank the canna punch or the Keith Cola?
[39:34.620 --> 39:35.620]  Oh yeah.
[39:35.620 --> 39:38.100]  Do you feel like you get high more quickly?
[39:38.100 --> 39:39.500]  The liquid's definitely kicking quicker.
[39:39.500 --> 39:40.500]  It's sublingual.
[39:40.500 --> 39:41.500]  Yeah, it's because it's sublingual.
[39:41.500 --> 39:42.500]  That canna punch gets me.
[39:42.500 --> 39:45.700]  You get a nice sublingual and your stomach doesn't have to break down the brownie.
[39:45.700 --> 39:46.700]  Yeah, exactly.
[39:46.700 --> 39:47.700]  Right.
[39:47.700 --> 39:49.260]  It's just absorbable quicker.
[39:49.260 --> 39:51.780]  It's like you drink it and then you go to do whatever you're doing and then you turn
[39:51.780 --> 39:55.300]  your head to one way to look at something and you go, oh, I'm high.
[39:56.260 --> 39:58.660]  With canna punch, check the label.
[39:58.660 --> 40:01.620]  There's a range of THC in the canna punches.
[40:01.620 --> 40:05.900]  I drink a 200 and I drink it in about one good chug.
[40:05.900 --> 40:07.060]  Check the back of the label.
[40:07.060 --> 40:08.060]  It might be like 230.
[40:08.060 --> 40:11.220]  30 milligrams ain't going to make a difference to me.
[40:11.220 --> 40:15.780]  Well, in the rec market, there's like a 10, 15, 20 milligram swing that you can see on
[40:15.780 --> 40:16.780]  the back of those.
[40:16.780 --> 40:17.780]  Yes, it might be higher than medical.
[40:17.780 --> 40:20.980]  In fact, as soon as we get done here, I'm going to go eat another 100 milligrams from
[40:20.980 --> 40:21.980]  Sky's Garden.
[40:21.980 --> 40:26.020]  I had a cool hash on the table and I was really pumped to see that it had lab testing
[40:26.020 --> 40:27.420]  for potency on the back.
[40:27.420 --> 40:30.420]  That's the medicals coming along with that and I love to see it.
[40:30.420 --> 40:31.420]  For sure.
[40:31.420 --> 40:32.740]  Totally random interjection there.
[40:32.740 --> 40:34.260]  Pretty soon everything will be lab tested.
[40:34.260 --> 40:35.260]  Go ahead.
[40:35.260 --> 40:39.300]  We had a customer appreciation day at the shop and I chugged a Keef Cola, a hundred
[40:39.300 --> 40:44.500]  milligram orange soda before it, not thinking like anything of it.
[40:44.500 --> 40:50.060]  And I'm like 45 minutes into being there and I'm like, what the fuck is the matter with
[40:50.060 --> 40:51.060]  me?
[40:51.140 --> 40:55.220]  And then I remember the conversation I had had with Buzzy a couple of days before that
[40:55.220 --> 40:58.820]  about how like drinks are sublingual and they like hit you harder.
[40:58.820 --> 41:01.420]  And I was like, wow, you're an idiot, Lindsay.
[41:01.420 --> 41:03.260]  You just chugged that thing right before you came in.
[41:03.260 --> 41:06.140]  Not even like, it didn't taste that hashy.
[41:06.140 --> 41:08.500]  So I was just like, go, go, go.
[41:08.500 --> 41:13.020]  We got a bunch of 10 milligram samples at one point and I took the four flavor samples
[41:13.020 --> 41:18.100]  we got home and without thinking about it, drank all four of them and like jotted down
[41:18.100 --> 41:23.100]  a little flavor review about each one and just ruined myself.
[41:23.100 --> 41:25.460]  I like being edible ruined to an extent.
[41:25.460 --> 41:26.460]  Yeah.
[41:26.460 --> 41:27.460]  Can you pass me the torch?
[41:27.460 --> 41:30.780]  I think about 250 milligrams right now is just about perfect for me.
[41:30.780 --> 41:33.740]  I don't want to go too much far past there because that's when I started getting a little
[41:33.740 --> 41:36.340]  goofy, started getting a little hazy.
[41:36.340 --> 41:37.740]  But I'm back on the edible horse.
[41:37.740 --> 41:40.420]  So when I see you, I will not, probably not be able to see.
[41:40.420 --> 41:41.420]  Did you say edible whore or horse?
[41:41.420 --> 41:42.420]  Yeah, I thought he did too.
[41:42.420 --> 41:43.420]  Funny the way I heard it.
[41:43.420 --> 41:45.820]  I think you said whore.
[41:45.820 --> 41:46.820]  Well that too.
[41:47.020 --> 41:48.020]  Whichever.
[41:48.020 --> 41:50.900]  I'm going to be an edible whore.
[41:50.900 --> 41:52.540]  I'll take any edibles you have.
[41:52.540 --> 41:56.580]  He didn't say he was going to be, or he was back to being an edible whore.
[41:56.580 --> 41:59.940]  He said, I'm back on the edible whore, which is way fucking funny.
[41:59.940 --> 42:01.420]  Well, then I'm doing that.
[42:01.420 --> 42:02.420]  Yeah.
[42:02.420 --> 42:04.700]  You got a hashtag on the edible whore.
[42:04.700 --> 42:08.020]  Hashtag who are you?
[42:08.020 --> 42:10.020]  Hashtag can I get on it too?
[42:10.020 --> 42:11.020]  Hashtag troll the host.
[42:11.020 --> 42:12.020]  Oh, I like it.
[42:12.020 --> 42:13.020]  I like it.
[42:13.020 --> 42:14.020]  Hashtag I need a carb.
[42:14.020 --> 42:15.020]  I think my edibles are working.
[42:15.020 --> 42:16.020]  I think the dabs are all working.
[42:16.220 --> 42:17.220]  I'm going to be a hot dab buddy.
[42:17.220 --> 42:18.220]  Instant karma.
[42:18.220 --> 42:19.220]  Ooh.
[42:19.220 --> 42:20.220]  Antic hot dabs.
[42:20.220 --> 42:21.220]  Oh yeah.
[42:21.220 --> 42:22.220]  That was a little warm bro.
[42:22.220 --> 42:24.060]  That was a little bit warm.
[42:24.060 --> 42:25.060]  That's going to feel it in your chest.
[42:25.060 --> 42:26.060]  Hot and hurty.
[42:26.060 --> 42:27.060]  Hashtag hurty.
[42:27.060 --> 42:28.060]  Should I just turn off your mic?
[42:28.060 --> 42:29.060]  Should I just turn off your mic?
[42:29.060 --> 42:30.060]  Yeah, go ahead.
[42:30.060 --> 42:31.060]  You probably want to.
[42:31.060 --> 42:35.860]  All right, right now, tell us how to find you on social media, Mike.
[42:35.860 --> 42:39.660]  At Nemopunk15 on Twitter or Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws on Facebook.
[42:39.660 --> 42:41.660]  Yes, killing it.
[42:41.660 --> 42:44.660]  He got it all.
[42:45.300 --> 42:46.300]  That was glorious.
[42:46.300 --> 42:47.300]  He got it all.
[42:47.300 --> 42:48.300]  That was glorious.
[42:48.300 --> 42:51.020]  You know, when I wrote this episode, when I wrote the notes, I really thought that everybody
[42:51.020 --> 42:54.340]  was limited to eight grams of purchasing, so it really changed the impact of my attitude
[42:54.340 --> 42:57.100]  and of this show, and I learned that that was only a recreational thing.
[42:57.100 --> 42:59.260]  I'm not so fired up about it now.
[42:59.260 --> 43:00.860]  This round of rules was pretty rational.
[43:00.860 --> 43:01.860]  Pretty reasonable.
[43:01.860 --> 43:04.860]  You can still buy what you want, boo boo.
[43:04.860 --> 43:05.860]  Rational and reasonable.
[43:05.860 --> 43:06.860]  Did you say rationable?
[43:06.860 --> 43:07.860]  I did.
[43:07.860 --> 43:08.860]  Hashtag rational.
[43:08.860 --> 43:09.860]  Coughing.
[43:09.860 --> 43:10.860]  Long syllable words are hard.
[43:10.860 --> 43:12.860]  You guys, we're making up our own words here on the podcast.
[43:12.860 --> 43:13.860]  Somebody call Webster.
[43:14.060 --> 43:15.060]  Get your own podcast.
[43:15.060 --> 43:16.060]  Set up some microphones.
[43:16.060 --> 43:18.060]  Get a feed, and you can make up your own words.
[43:18.060 --> 43:19.060]  Just say them into the microphone.
[43:19.060 --> 43:20.060]  There's got to be some sort of rule.
[43:20.060 --> 43:23.060]  If you say a word more than six or seven or twelve times, then it's got to be a word now.
[43:23.060 --> 43:24.060]  Sure.
[43:24.060 --> 43:25.060]  It's got to work that way.
[43:25.060 --> 43:28.060]  People who attend vape competitions, I can say rational.
[43:28.060 --> 43:29.060]  Yeah.
[43:29.060 --> 43:30.060]  Makes sense.
[43:30.060 --> 43:31.060]  I'm going to leave the vape kids alone.
[43:31.060 --> 43:32.060]  They have enough trouble.
[43:32.060 --> 43:33.060]  Have.
[43:33.060 --> 43:35.060]  Lindsay, my friend, how can people find you on social media?
[43:35.060 --> 43:37.060]  Let's hear about all 37 of your accounts.
[43:37.060 --> 43:38.060]  LOL.
[43:38.060 --> 43:39.060]  Stop.
[43:39.060 --> 43:40.060]  I have, let me see.
[43:40.060 --> 43:43.060]  I love that you say LOL on Facebook.
[43:43.260 --> 43:44.260]  I know.
[43:44.260 --> 43:45.260]  She says that out loud.
[43:45.260 --> 43:46.260]  Yeah.
[43:46.260 --> 43:47.260]  She's not even really laughing.
[43:47.260 --> 43:49.260]  No, she's not laughing out loud.
[43:49.260 --> 43:50.260]  Just like it is when you read it.
[43:50.260 --> 43:51.260]  It's not true.
[43:51.260 --> 43:52.260]  Yeah.
[43:52.260 --> 44:03.260]  So I'm the traveling stoner on Instagram and Periscope, and I am the travel stoner on Twitter.
[44:03.260 --> 44:10.260]  And yeah, hopefully the next time I'm on here, I'm in the midst of constructing my website.
[44:10.460 --> 44:14.460]  So hopefully the next time that I'm on here, I'll be able to talk about that.
[44:14.460 --> 44:17.460]  I would love to troll your website and share it with everybody.
[44:17.460 --> 44:18.460]  Please don't troll my website.
[44:18.460 --> 44:19.460]  You already know I will.
[44:19.460 --> 44:20.460]  I know.
[44:20.460 --> 44:22.460]  You guys, thank you both for coming on the show.
[44:22.460 --> 44:23.460]  Mike, I hope to get you on the next episode.
[44:23.460 --> 44:24.460]  Lindsay, we may have you here too.
[44:24.460 --> 44:29.460]  Somebody asked me a question and it directly says, I hope you and Mike can answer this.
[44:29.460 --> 44:31.460]  So Mike, I hope you're here for that one.
[44:31.460 --> 44:32.460]  Good listeners.
[44:32.460 --> 44:33.460]  Keep them coming.
[44:33.460 --> 44:34.460]  Good listeners.
[44:34.460 --> 44:35.460]  Yeah.
[44:35.460 --> 44:36.460]  I'm always happy to come back.
[44:36.460 --> 44:38.460]  The more feedback, the better.
[44:38.660 --> 44:43.660]  We know what to dig up and which part of our ridiculous amount of cannabis knowledge to throw at you.
[44:43.660 --> 44:44.660]  That's the truth.
[44:44.660 --> 44:48.660]  If you've got questions that you would like me to answer or Mike or even Lindsay, you can send me questions.
[44:48.660 --> 44:49.660]  GrowFromYourHeart.hotmail.com.
[44:49.660 --> 44:51.660]  Let me know what you'd like to know.
[44:51.660 --> 44:52.660]  We will talk about it here on the podcast.
[44:52.660 --> 44:53.660]  We'll give you a shout out.
[44:53.660 --> 45:00.660]  If we don't happen to know a good answer to your question, we'll find the person in the community who does and drag them onto the podcast.
[45:00.660 --> 45:02.660]  Mike, you were like my volleyball partner.
[45:02.660 --> 45:04.660]  You set them up and I will spike them, bro.
[45:04.860 --> 45:10.860]  Speaking of not knowing the answers to some things, people have asked me to do an episode about LED lighting.
[45:10.860 --> 45:12.860]  I personally have never grown with LEDs.
[45:12.860 --> 45:14.860]  I don't know shit about LEDs.
[45:14.860 --> 45:18.860]  I've got two friends that claim they're going to drive from Denver and do an LED episode with me.
[45:18.860 --> 45:19.860]  Atta boy.
[45:19.860 --> 45:20.860]  I know one of them will show up.
[45:20.860 --> 45:21.860]  I know him personally.
[45:21.860 --> 45:24.860]  The other guy, I don't know, so I don't know if I can get him to drive.
[45:24.860 --> 45:26.860]  He lives about 130 miles from here.
[45:26.860 --> 45:28.860]  If he's willing to drive to the podcast, I'd love to get him on.
[45:28.860 --> 45:32.860]  So maybe I'll get both those cats on and we'll do a quick episode about LED lighting.
[45:33.060 --> 45:38.060]  Also, I'm trying to get in touch with the guy that makes the 315s.
[45:38.060 --> 45:41.060]  I think I commented on one of his Facebook posts.
[45:41.060 --> 45:42.060]  He did not reply.
[45:42.060 --> 45:44.060]  I'm not even sure it's the right dude.
[45:44.060 --> 45:46.060]  So I'm going to get in touch with the dude that makes the 315s.
[45:46.060 --> 45:48.060]  The LECs, the light emitting ceramics.
[45:48.060 --> 45:50.060]  We'll get that guy on the podcast.
[45:50.060 --> 45:52.060]  We'll talk about those in the future.
[45:52.060 --> 45:53.060]  Also, check this out.
[45:53.060 --> 45:57.060]  You guys have asked for an episode about cannabis and pregnancy.
[45:57.060 --> 46:00.060]  I have done a lot of research.
[46:00.060 --> 46:02.060]  There is so much stuff out there.
[46:02.260 --> 46:05.260]  I honestly am not qualified to do an episode about cannabis and pregnancy.
[46:05.260 --> 46:06.260]  I'm not a doctor.
[46:06.260 --> 46:08.260]  I'm not a woman.
[46:08.260 --> 46:13.260]  And those are two things that I feel like I should be at least one of to do an episode about pregnancy.
[46:13.260 --> 46:18.260]  If you are either a doctor or a woman or a woman doctor
[46:18.260 --> 46:21.260]  or if you've got experience with cannabis and pregnancy
[46:21.260 --> 46:23.260]  and you know more than I do and you're more comfortable with the subject,
[46:23.260 --> 46:25.260]  I'd love to get you on.
[46:25.260 --> 46:26.260]  We could talk all about it.
[46:26.260 --> 46:31.260]  The only thing I could throw in on that topic is the relevant laws you might be breaking
[46:31.460 --> 46:34.460]  and the repercussions you might face legally
[46:34.460 --> 46:38.460]  and how that system works in places like Colorado.
[46:38.460 --> 46:45.460]  I used to read this all the time in patient's charts when I worked with locked up teens.
[46:45.460 --> 46:49.460]  It's something that's going to follow your kid around for that life.
[46:49.460 --> 46:55.460]  If the hospital chooses to drug test you or your baby during the delivery.
[46:55.460 --> 46:57.460]  And if you've got dreadlocks or if you look like me,
[46:57.460 --> 46:59.460]  your kid's going to get drug tested as soon as it comes out.
[46:59.660 --> 47:01.660]  For the most part, the system works.
[47:01.660 --> 47:04.660]  It's just if anybody involved in the birthing process,
[47:04.660 --> 47:06.660]  like that whole hospital stay,
[47:06.660 --> 47:10.660]  decides to, yeah, let's drug test that mom and that baby,
[47:10.660 --> 47:12.660]  then it happens.
[47:12.660 --> 47:15.660]  And it's just if anybody happens to make that decision.
[47:15.660 --> 47:18.660]  The local anti-pot group down here,
[47:18.660 --> 47:21.660]  they're working with one of the hospitals.
[47:21.660 --> 47:24.660]  And they've got one month's worth of data.
[47:24.660 --> 47:28.660]  And they're like, half the babies we tested came back positive for THC.
[47:28.860 --> 47:30.860]  And that's the end of their statement.
[47:30.860 --> 47:32.860]  If you dig a little deeper,
[47:32.860 --> 47:34.860]  10 babies were tested during that period.
[47:34.860 --> 47:36.860]  Five of them came back positive for THC.
[47:36.860 --> 47:38.860]  Doesn't tell you what was up with the other five.
[47:40.860 --> 47:43.860]  But it's part of the national legalization conversation.
[47:43.860 --> 47:46.860]  It could be a cool episode if we could find the right people.
[47:46.860 --> 47:50.860]  Yeah, I don't have, that's not my wheelhouse, I guess.
[47:50.860 --> 47:52.860]  I literally just had to look up all of these laws
[47:52.860 --> 47:57.860]  because I work in the legal industry and had a kid while I did that.
[47:58.060 --> 47:59.060]  Right.
[47:59.060 --> 48:01.060]  What do you do, both of you have been bud tenders, Mike.
[48:01.060 --> 48:03.060]  I don't know if we should, you're no longer a bud tender.
[48:03.060 --> 48:04.060]  You were a bud tender.
[48:04.060 --> 48:05.060]  Lindsey is a bud tender.
[48:05.060 --> 48:08.060]  What do you do if a pregnant customer comes in and tries to buy cannabis?
[48:08.060 --> 48:10.060]  It's perfectly legal.
[48:10.060 --> 48:12.060]  To purchase it because you...
[48:12.060 --> 48:16.060]  Well, like, what happened with us is that,
[48:16.060 --> 48:18.060]  I don't, are we going to do this for this show?
[48:18.060 --> 48:20.060]  It was just something you brought up randomly
[48:20.060 --> 48:23.060]  and all of a sudden this is like a two-hour show now.
[48:23.060 --> 48:26.060]  But quick answer, what happens if I'm pregnant and I try to buy weed?
[48:26.260 --> 48:28.260]  Well, like, absolutely nothing.
[48:28.260 --> 48:30.260]  You tell me, we'll treat it like any other day.
[48:30.260 --> 48:31.260]  You treated like any other customer, yeah.
[48:31.260 --> 48:34.260]  The girl in front of me in the dispensary the other day was pregnant
[48:34.260 --> 48:37.260]  and they served her no issues.
[48:37.260 --> 48:40.260]  When my wife was pregnant, she stopped at the gas station
[48:40.260 --> 48:42.260]  a couple of times and bought me cigarettes.
[48:42.260 --> 48:43.260]  And like the second time she did it,
[48:43.260 --> 48:45.260]  she was like, I ain't fucking doing that again.
[48:45.260 --> 48:46.260]  I was like, what?
[48:46.260 --> 48:48.260]  I just wasn't paying attention.
[48:48.260 --> 48:50.260]  It's just something she's done for forever.
[48:50.260 --> 48:52.260]  And I looked up and I was like, what?
[48:52.260 --> 48:53.260]  And I said, what?
[48:53.260 --> 48:54.260]  I was like, oh, people judge you.
[48:54.260 --> 48:55.260]  Yeah, that probably looks like shit.
[48:55.460 --> 48:58.460]  There's a whole bunch of stuff that your doctor tells you
[48:58.460 --> 49:00.460]  you shouldn't consume or do while you're pregnant.
[49:00.460 --> 49:02.460]  And it's all legal.
[49:02.460 --> 49:05.460]  Well, not all, because like heroin and coke and shit
[49:05.460 --> 49:06.460]  are on that list too.
[49:06.460 --> 49:11.460]  But like 99% of it's legal and it's just not advised.
[49:11.460 --> 49:14.460]  So, yeah.
[49:14.460 --> 49:17.460]  Well, if you are an expert, please.
[49:17.460 --> 49:20.460]  Yeah, or even have more education on it than I do
[49:20.460 --> 49:22.460]  and you're more comfortable talking about it than I am.
[49:22.660 --> 49:25.660]  I feel like that's more of a woman's topic
[49:25.660 --> 49:27.660]  and I should have a woman involved in this
[49:27.660 --> 49:28.660]  to help me through this
[49:28.660 --> 49:30.660]  so that I don't sound like a sexist dude that's uneducated.
[49:30.660 --> 49:35.660]  So let's get a doctor or a lady to come help me out with this one.
[49:35.660 --> 49:36.660]  I would love to do this episode.
[49:36.660 --> 49:37.660]  I'd love to do it.
[49:37.660 --> 49:38.660]  A lot of people have questions.
[49:38.660 --> 49:40.660]  I've gotten probably more than three emails on this.
[49:40.660 --> 49:41.660]  Probably three to five emails or questions
[49:41.660 --> 49:43.660]  about cannabis and pregnancy.
[49:43.660 --> 49:45.660]  So I'd love to get some help on that one.
[49:45.660 --> 49:46.660]  You guys, I think that's all
[49:46.660 --> 49:48.660]  that we have got for you in this episode.
[49:48.660 --> 49:49.660]  I want to thank my friends again
[49:49.660 --> 49:50.660]  for coming and hanging out with me.
[49:50.660 --> 49:51.660]  Thanks for having us.
[49:51.860 --> 49:52.860]  Anytime.
[49:52.860 --> 49:53.860]  I want to give a huge shout out to Max
[49:53.860 --> 49:55.860]  for getting me back on the edible bandwagon.
[49:55.860 --> 49:56.860]  Shout out to Schumann Bars.
[49:56.860 --> 50:00.860]  The banana pudding 100 milligram THC bar set me straight.
[50:00.860 --> 50:02.860]  Also shout out to my friends at Gaia's Garden.
[50:02.860 --> 50:04.860]  Shout out to Mick the dog.
[50:05.860 --> 50:07.860]  Some kind of alarm going off.
[50:07.860 --> 50:09.860]  Shout out to the alarm going off.
[50:10.860 --> 50:11.860]  That's for me.
[50:11.860 --> 50:12.860]  That's the end of the show.
[50:12.860 --> 50:13.860]  It's like shut up.
[50:13.860 --> 50:14.860]  That's the end of the show, you guys.
[50:14.860 --> 50:15.860]  All right, that's all I got for you.
[50:15.860 --> 50:16.860]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[50:16.860 --> 50:17.860]  I'd love it if you'd send me some questions.

[50:21.060 --> 50:22.060]  or if you want to sponsor the show
[50:22.060 --> 50:23.060]  I would love to hear from you.

[50:46.060 --> 50:48.060]  and give your mom a hug for me.
[52:08.880 --> 52:10.880]  Love to see my enemies
[52:10.880 --> 52:13.880]  on the end of their rope
[52:13.880 --> 52:15.880]  Walk on, Pennsylvania
