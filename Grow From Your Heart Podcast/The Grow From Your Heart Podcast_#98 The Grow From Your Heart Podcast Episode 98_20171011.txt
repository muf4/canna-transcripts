[00:22.090 --> 00:27.210]  Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's

[00:30.290 --> 00:33.930]  or a veteran dabber, if you're a cannabis activist, or if you're someone who's just
[00:33.930 --> 00:38.290]  curious about the current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you. I'm
[00:38.290 --> 00:42.010]  your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff. Thanks again for joining me. You guys sitting
[00:42.010 --> 00:45.290]  across the table from me once again is my good buddy, White Mike. How you doing buddy?
[00:45.290 --> 00:46.530]  Doing well, man. How are you?
[00:46.530 --> 00:49.730]  I am great. I'm a little bit dabbed the fuck out. I got a couple of new rigs. I've been
[00:49.730 --> 00:53.610]  hitting them like a champion. They're working. The hash is working.
[00:53.610 --> 00:54.610]  Working well.
[00:54.610 --> 00:57.290]  I'm going to drop that music right out. I didn't mean to go so abruptly with the music.
[00:57.290 --> 01:00.490]  Sorry about that. Tried to be smooth, tried to transition. We ended up just dropping that
[01:00.490 --> 01:02.530]  shit to zero. Well, thanks for coming, bro.
[01:02.530 --> 01:03.530]  Yeah.
[01:03.530 --> 01:04.530]  Did you work today?
[01:04.530 --> 01:05.530]  I did.
[01:05.530 --> 01:06.530]  Yeah. You look like you've been at work all fucking day.
[01:06.530 --> 01:10.970]  I have. It's been a long day at work, but we're not going to talk about work for all
[01:10.970 --> 01:11.970]  of us at this time.
[01:11.970 --> 01:15.530]  No, no. Last time Mike was here, we kind of talked a little bit about the spot last time.
[01:15.530 --> 01:18.690]  We're not going to do that. We are going to talk about some other stuff. So I just
[01:18.690 --> 01:21.730]  want to give Mike a big thanks for getting here because he's a new father. I know it's
[01:21.730 --> 01:24.650]  got to be kind of rough pulling you away from the kid. So thanks for showing up at this
[01:24.650 --> 01:26.210]  kind of late hour on a Saturday night.
[01:26.210 --> 01:29.090]  Right. There's a couple of reasons I'm half awake right now.
[01:29.090 --> 01:31.930]  We'll slap you around if you fall asleep. I may push the mic right into your face and
[01:31.930 --> 01:34.570]  make you talk a lot because I keep turning shit up and it's not going to go much higher.
[01:34.570 --> 01:35.570]  All right. I'll stay on the mic.
[01:35.570 --> 01:39.770]  There you go. There you go. That's what we need. Nice. So let's see. Where do we want
[01:39.770 --> 01:44.810]  to start? We've got a lot of great news articles to talk about you guys. Before I get too far,
[01:44.810 --> 01:49.330]  I want to give a huge shout out to my new friends at Elevate Glass in Colorado Springs.
[01:49.330 --> 01:52.970]  Elevate Glass is on South Tejon. I should have the exact address in my hand. I think
[01:52.970 --> 01:59.530]  it's five. I'm going to say 512 South Tejon. It's on the 500 block of South Tejon. There
[01:59.530 --> 02:03.850]  is a dispensary right there, Altitude Organic Medicine. And then there's a tattoo shop.
[02:03.850 --> 02:08.690]  And then right next to that is Elevate the Glass Shop. Go there. They've got great glass
[02:08.690 --> 02:13.850]  at affordable pricing. And they might have super hot chicks working there. Maybe, you
[02:13.890 --> 02:17.290]  know, that might be one of the bonuses of why I like to go there. I can't confirm it
[02:17.290 --> 02:21.930]  or die. Yeah, Mike has not gone with me. I've been there twice. And both times there was
[02:21.930 --> 02:27.690]  a very lovely lady there, ready and willing and able to help me with all of my glass needs.
[02:27.690 --> 02:33.010]  It was great. I'll definitely be back. I got a new I think I talked about the it's a mothership
[02:33.010 --> 02:37.410]  knockoff basically that I got there about a week ago. And then just last night, I went
[02:37.410 --> 02:42.530]  and picked up a little hitman. It's a mini with the hammerhead on the inside and I had
[02:42.530 --> 02:46.810]  to grab it. It's got a yellow logo. I've never seen a hitman like this with the yellow
[02:46.810 --> 02:51.210]  logo before and I thought it was super cute. So I picked it up and man it hits like a Mack
[02:51.210 --> 02:55.930]  truck so I'm super impressed. It really does. It's a your collection is growing by leaps
[02:55.930 --> 03:02.770]  and bounds and the new additions are wonderful was the first word that comes to mind. Nice,
[03:02.770 --> 03:06.650]  nice. I don't have as many rigs as you might think because I got rid of a couple through
[03:06.650 --> 03:10.330]  a place to make room for these so right I swap them out with the old and with the new
[03:10.330 --> 03:14.010]  that's the truth. I'm not as much of a rig junkie as you might think by Master Shake.
[03:14.010 --> 03:17.650]  Yeah, Master Shake was fun. Sloppy's got that shout out to sloppy. Make sure you guys check
[03:17.650 --> 03:22.030]  out oil Olympian arts on Facebook. That's my buddy sloppy. It's his glass trading page.
[03:22.030 --> 03:27.330]  If you're looking for new glass, or artistic glass functional glass at a great price. My
[03:27.330 --> 03:31.370]  buddy sloppy is now in the glass business. So make sure you support that shout out to
[03:31.370 --> 03:36.690]  sloppy. Alright, so somebody sent me an email. Let's start off the show with an email from
[03:36.690 --> 03:41.170]  a friend. This is kind of not cannabis related. And it's funny because he starts his email.
[03:41.170 --> 03:45.610]  This is from my buddy Justin. And the email says so this isn't really a show or growing
[03:45.610 --> 03:49.970]  question just a matter of personal curiosity. What do you think of Montez Yahoo? Do you
[03:49.970 --> 03:55.050]  feel like his music is reggae or not? Or not really listen to him just wondering doing
[03:55.050 --> 04:00.370]  fat dabs from Justin G. Justin, dude, I want to give you a big shout out you follow me
[04:00.370 --> 04:04.770]  on Facebook. You follow me on the podcast you follow me on almost every periscope video
[04:04.770 --> 04:09.930]  that I make. I really appreciate your support. It's great to have a little cult that will
[04:09.930 --> 04:13.570]  listen to almost everything that I put out. I definitely appreciate you guys that are
[04:13.570 --> 04:18.170]  my little following there. That's freaking awesome. I totally appreciate that. So let's
[04:18.170 --> 04:22.050]  talk about Montez Yahoo. Mike's ridden around in the car with me and heard what happens
[04:22.050 --> 04:25.930]  when Montez Yahoo comes up on the shuffle. You got to join in and get out those rigged
[04:25.930 --> 04:29.490]  diggity do it diggity do it toys. You got to get there and get going with him dude.
[04:29.490 --> 04:36.490]  That shit is so much fun. I've learned to meditate while you drive. Not just hold on.
[04:36.490 --> 04:41.850]  Yeah. Kind of wedge yourself in there for impact and then tune out and pretend like
[04:41.850 --> 04:45.770]  it's not reggae all day. You put yourself in your happy place. Yeah, I get reggae enough
[04:45.770 --> 04:49.730]  to work bro. Oh, they do play some reggae at work. All right. So let's talk about how
[04:49.730 --> 04:56.730]  I feel about Montez Yahoo. Dude, that's kind of so one day my buddy Ross Christian who
[04:56.970 --> 05:01.290]  was one of the guys that taught me a lot about Rastafari. I shout out to Chris much respect.
[05:01.290 --> 05:05.730]  Ross Chris gave me a little CD with one Montez Yahoo song on it and I came home and listened
[05:05.730 --> 05:09.890]  to it and I was like that is the shit right there. I just really liked the flow like the
[05:09.890 --> 05:13.950]  music was good, but I liked the way it felt. It just flowed really smooth. His lyrics were
[05:13.950 --> 05:18.590]  really smooth over everything. So I downloaded more right and I loved it. I found shake off
[05:18.590 --> 05:23.530]  the dust or rise and I found live at stubs or what was available at that time. So I was
[05:23.530 --> 05:28.850]  driving from Pueblo Colorado to Lawrence, Kansas on a regular basis. I had a band out
[05:28.850 --> 05:32.750]  there and I was lived here and had a band out there and then I travel back and forth
[05:32.750 --> 05:37.890]  all the time to take care of life. I had a CD player in the car and all of my CDs got
[05:37.890 --> 05:43.130]  stolen except for the one that was in the CD player that happened to a bunch of people.
[05:43.130 --> 05:46.890]  I know and it was live at stubs. It was the live at stubs album. So that's what I had
[05:46.890 --> 05:50.570]  to drive back and forth to Lawrence, Kansas and it's about a 10 11 hour drive depending
[05:50.570 --> 05:55.470]  on traffic and depending on how things go. So that's 10 or 11 opportunities to listen
[05:55.470 --> 06:01.850]  to that CD from beginning to end both ways. Yeah, I totally fell in love with that album
[06:01.850 --> 06:06.890]  do check off the dust rise came a little bit later in my life. I think I got that one right
[06:06.890 --> 06:11.450]  after I got tired of the lot right after the theft right after everything got stolen. But
[06:11.450 --> 06:16.350]  yeah, so I went to Lawrence, Kansas and showed a couple of my friends I was like, check this
[06:16.350 --> 06:20.190]  guy out. And then we saw him at Walker Rusa. And on the first night at Walker Rusa fest
[06:20.190 --> 06:24.830]  in 2005, I believe there wasn't anybody there. There's like 40 of us up front checking out
[06:24.830 --> 06:29.510]  Montes Yahoo. The second night there had to be 150 people there. The third night that
[06:29.510 --> 06:32.990]  place was packed bro. He took one night off. It was like a four night festival. He takes
[06:32.990 --> 06:38.230]  a Saturday off for the the Sabbath. By the Sunday night when he played it was packed.
[06:38.230 --> 06:41.710]  You couldn't even get in the tent to see the man anymore. Yeah. So over three nights, he
[06:41.710 --> 06:47.470]  just blew up like that. So I've seen Montes I got to go see Montes Yahoo on my one of
[06:47.470 --> 06:51.550]  my birthdays. My girlfriend took me to see him at the Beaumont Theater in Kansas City,
[06:51.550 --> 06:55.990]  Kansas, of all random places when I lived in Lawrence. So yeah, I got to see Montes
[06:55.990 --> 07:00.630]  a few times a scene with the bottleneck and Lawrence. I've seen him a lot. But yeah, that
[07:00.630 --> 07:04.430]  artist meant a lot to me just from that time period. It really brings me back to that whole
[07:04.430 --> 07:10.550]  time period of my life. Think got no water was my favorite Montes song. And then unfortunately,
[07:10.550 --> 07:16.150]  when he came out with the album Youth, I feel like he put all of his life's work into
[07:16.150 --> 07:20.750]  the shake off the dust arise album, like all of his writing for 20 years of being a person
[07:20.750 --> 07:25.470]  he put into that. And then he did shake our live at Stubbs, which is basically the same
[07:25.470 --> 07:29.070]  thing just live. And then they're like, All right, now you've got a production deal and
[07:29.070 --> 07:32.590]  a record deal. Let's make an expensive album. And he was like, Oh, shit, I already put it
[07:32.590 --> 07:37.110]  all out. It seemed like he'd already kind of done almost like his new stuff. I don't
[07:37.310 --> 07:41.550]  like the new stuff as much as I did the old stuff. But that happens to a lot of artists.
[07:41.550 --> 07:45.950]  I feel the same way about spearhead kind of older shit was much better. There's something
[07:45.950 --> 07:53.670]  about music that whatever drives you to create it. dies when enough money lands on top of
[07:53.670 --> 07:57.270]  it. Right? That's kind of how I feel about it. Like especially if you're like an angry
[07:57.270 --> 08:01.310]  band, that's where you see it the most. Like, all right, you just got like a $12 million
[08:01.310 --> 08:05.310]  contract. Why are you still angry? Right? And unless they really start buying just more
[08:05.310 --> 08:09.350]  expensive heroin or something, right? Yeah, yeah. Where would we where would music this
[08:09.350 --> 08:12.910]  we've really gotten off the rails of this podcast, but where would you think Jeff knows
[08:12.910 --> 08:18.950]  a lot about weed? He knows so much more about music. I do know a lot about music. Yeah,
[08:18.950 --> 08:22.710]  I could probably could do a music podcast. I've played the drums for so long. I can read
[08:22.710 --> 08:27.190]  and write music and I know a lot about music, music playing and listening and then I also
[08:27.190 --> 08:30.910]  know about bands. Yeah, we could do a whole show about that. Because we've gotten way
[08:30.910 --> 08:35.950]  off topic. But where would we be? Where would music be? Where would musicians be if they
[08:35.950 --> 08:39.470]  didn't alter their minds a little bit? The Beatles would have never came up with any
[08:39.470 --> 08:43.390]  of that shit if they didn't start life would be very, very boring. Their minds. musicians
[08:43.390 --> 08:47.590]  didn't smoke weed. Yeah, for sure. The Grateful Dead would not have been fun if I was not
[08:47.590 --> 08:53.670]  tripping my face off. I think there's a great Lenny Bruce rant to that effect. If I remember
[08:53.670 --> 08:56.790]  correctly. All right. So I want to put the show back on track just a little bit. We're
[08:56.790 --> 09:00.070]  almost 10 minutes in and we haven't talked about weed at all. Hey, Justin, thanks for
[09:00.070 --> 09:04.190]  the email, dude. You really like made me time travel in my mind when I read that I
[09:04.190 --> 09:09.030]  was really reminiscing on those days. Montes. Yeah, who's great. He's got a great message.
[09:09.030 --> 09:14.350]  He's a positive dude. He doesn't use any profanity. So it's good for the kids. He only talks about
[09:14.350 --> 09:19.590]  good stuff. And to pump your head and heart with good stuff is always better than listening
[09:19.590 --> 09:23.770]  to some negative shit that makes you want to do stupid shit. I don't listen to things
[09:23.770 --> 09:28.470]  like insane clown posse and shit like that. Because it doesn't support anything good for
[09:28.470 --> 09:33.990]  your mind. So listen to some Montes Yahoo, listen to some spearhead. A lot of people
[09:33.990 --> 09:38.790]  around here into knocko I can't get into knocko for some reason. knocko and medicine for the
[09:38.790 --> 09:42.270]  people but a lot of the hippie kids or all the dreadlock kids are loving it now. So check
[09:42.270 --> 09:46.910]  that out if you need some good positive music in your life. All right, let's get on to something
[09:46.910 --> 09:52.630]  that has something to do with cannabis. Do you want to talk about? Let's see. You want
[09:52.630 --> 09:57.390]  to go I got three topics here. They're all equally important. We've got the 30 shops,
[09:57.390 --> 10:01.950]  we've got recreational cannabis is now legal in the state of Oregon. Should we start or
[10:01.950 --> 10:07.710]  end with good news? Well, all right, that's our good news. And then we've got an article
[10:07.710 --> 10:12.430]  about somebody getting shot. So let's go bad, bad, good. Let's end on a positive note this
[10:12.430 --> 10:16.110]  time. Last night, it was a down note, we had to come up with positive shit. All right,
[10:16.110 --> 10:20.910]  well, then let's start the bad bad if you want to go worst first, let me open up Google
[10:20.910 --> 10:25.330]  here. I've already got this article saved. Where is it? Here it is. It happened again
[10:25.330 --> 10:31.030]  this year you guys it is outdoor season and people people that are growing outdoors are
[10:31.030 --> 10:36.290]  sitting outside waiting for thieves the past two weekends over the past 14 or 15 days I
[10:36.290 --> 10:41.170]  have heard of about seven or eight maybe nine or 10 outdoor grows getting stolen. It's that
[10:41.170 --> 10:48.370]  time of year people it is ripper season. Yeah, or ripper homie season. I hate it. It's I've
[10:48.370 --> 10:56.410]  had a lot of people in my world have just wrecked winners because of rippers do they
[10:56.410 --> 11:01.810]  spend all summer throwing their life into a crop and then it vanishes. It's just days
[11:01.810 --> 11:05.530]  before it's done. You wake up you go out there to water your plants and guess what they're
[11:05.530 --> 11:11.290]  not there anymore. I saw something about a van get busted. I want to say it was in California
[11:11.290 --> 11:16.210]  that was just packed full of plants that had just been ripped. Oh shit. And I've seen a
[11:16.210 --> 11:20.850]  number of posts on Facebook of security cam footage with people's faces of people ripping
[11:20.850 --> 11:25.250]  plants. Yeah, right now if you are in any pot group on Facebook, somebody has posted
[11:25.250 --> 11:29.170]  a picture of some asshole and it says this guy stole my pot plants. Do you know who he
[11:29.170 --> 11:35.210]  is? It's all over Facebook right now everybody is getting ripped off. So it happened in our
[11:35.210 --> 11:38.770]  town. Somebody let's just get right to the news article here you guys I've got it on
[11:38.770 --> 11:44.730]  the on the screen. The headline is you need something over there, bro? Yeah, no, no, you
[11:44.730 --> 11:49.450]  need a dab. My brain wants cigarette but no. Oh, yeah, you can't do that. If you have
[11:49.450 --> 11:54.570]  a vape all that you've made here but no came unprepared came unprepared. I apologize for
[11:54.570 --> 11:58.690]  your lack of preparation son. Maybe if you take a dab it'll fucking settle down your
[11:58.690 --> 12:05.650]  urge. I don't know. I'm already stoned. I appreciate that. Keep you slightly coherent.
[12:05.650 --> 12:09.050]  Keep you slightly coherent. You are half asleep on the show already. Guys, we can't we can't
[12:09.050 --> 12:11.930]  make fun of Mike for being half asleep. He's a new father. He worked a long shift. He went
[12:11.930 --> 12:14.770]  home and ate dinner and then he came over here. It's like 11 o'clock on a Saturday night
[12:14.770 --> 12:20.250]  and this dude's here recording with me. If I went to bed at 7am. Thanks, baby. I love
[12:20.250 --> 12:27.170]  you too. And got up at 11. We're gonna work a nine hour shift. Like, yeah, what are you
[12:27.170 --> 12:31.090]  guys doing? You're fathering it up and I'm here recording a podcast at almost midnight
[12:31.090 --> 12:34.370]  on a Saturday. That's how cool we are getting it done for the people. Yeah, it's what we
[12:34.370 --> 12:38.770]  got to do. I'm running out of time to do things. I've been dedicated to the spot lately. It's
[12:38.770 --> 12:42.290]  worth jumping. We're there all the time. All right, let's not talk about that. We can't
[12:42.290 --> 12:45.490]  talk about the spot on the show. It's Nate on the hot space. That's just why we're here
[12:45.490 --> 12:50.130]  at midnight, bro. That's it. So the truth or the truth. The headline says, fuck, where's
[12:50.130 --> 12:54.850]  my brain? The headline says, before I get that far, this is from Jesse Paul of the Denver
[12:54.850 --> 13:00.450]  Post. I found it on Denver post.com. It says Pueblo police. That's our town. You guys Pueblo
[13:00.450 --> 13:06.250]  the city of Pueblo, Colorado, the 719. That's where we are. Pueblo police teen shot after
[13:06.250 --> 13:12.850]  burglarizing burglarizing burglarizing was the word that I couldn't say teen shot after
[13:12.850 --> 13:18.770]  burglarizing illegal marijuana grow investors. Investigators say Vincent Duran, the homeowner
[13:18.770 --> 13:23.170]  shot at the two alleged burglars. You got anything to say, Mike, you look like you're
[13:23.170 --> 13:29.290]  about to speak up. I heard about this story the next morning. And yeah, it's a horrible
[13:29.290 --> 13:35.890]  incident. Everybody's going to jail. Everybody. Both of the kids are being charged with burglary.
[13:35.890 --> 13:40.210]  The homeowner is being charged with first degree assault. That's what happens when you
[13:40.210 --> 13:43.450]  shoot somebody who's running away from your property. Okay. All right. Well, let's read
[13:43.450 --> 13:47.690]  the article here. It says a 17 year old boy was shot early Friday in Pueblo after authorities
[13:47.690 --> 13:52.490]  say he burglarized demands illegal marijuana grow. Now let's update the people why it's
[13:52.490 --> 13:57.290]  illegal before we even go too far, because we are in Colorado. Everyone is allowed to
[13:57.290 --> 14:01.910]  grow six plants of their own. Every adult. If you have a medical marijuana recommendation
[14:01.910 --> 14:07.110]  from a doctor, you are able to grow possibly more plants, but in the city of Pueblo, within
[14:07.110 --> 14:12.030]  the city limits of Pueblo, it is now illegal to grow any sort of cannabis, recreational
[14:12.030 --> 14:17.190]  or medicinal outside of your home in your yard. That is not in an enclosed building.
[14:17.190 --> 14:23.310]  Greenhouses are illegal. It has to be like a sealed, normal building, like a, a structure
[14:23.310 --> 14:29.030]  to be like in a, a fountain date, a building with a foundation as part of the rule. Um,
[14:29.030 --> 14:32.670]  it has to be so many square feet. Like there are thorough rules that you have to follow.
[14:32.670 --> 14:38.150]  Excuse me. No worries. That happens with the dabs. You, uh, you can't just plant six plants
[14:38.150 --> 14:43.870]  in your backyard anymore. Um, they did away with that a year ago. Uh, statewide, you just
[14:43.870 --> 14:49.170]  have to have it in a locked enclosed space, but, um, every city and County and town now
[14:49.170 --> 14:54.950]  have their own little rules for the most part. Right? So here we can follow them. And so
[14:54.950 --> 15:01.270]  his grow was, uh, illegal and he's being charged with, uh, nuisance violations. If
[15:01.270 --> 15:06.470]  I remember correctly, a thousand dollars a pop per plant. Wow. Yep. So that's 6,000 in
[15:06.470 --> 15:11.030]  city fines. Plus he's got to destroy the plants. Plus he's going, being charged with first
[15:11.030 --> 15:15.030]  degree assault for shooting a teenager. Uh, destroy them there. I would just cut them
[15:15.030 --> 15:19.150]  down and take them inside. It's just about time. He has to destroy them. How he destroyed
[15:19.150 --> 15:23.230]  it. Well, they could be just going to cut them down. Small fires. Yeah. He's got to
[15:23.230 --> 15:28.430]  cut them down and they can't be out there anymore, but it's harvest time anyway. Yeah.
[15:28.430 --> 15:33.450]  So he's just got to chop them down now, take them inside. But had this garden been discovered
[15:33.450 --> 15:37.510]  by city inspectors or regulators, or if the neighbor called the cops or whatever, six
[15:37.510 --> 15:41.710]  months ago when they were knee high and there was no bud there, he would have had to cut
[15:41.710 --> 15:45.590]  them down then too. Okay. All right. I'm going to continue with the article. Uh, we just
[15:45.590 --> 15:49.150]  wanted to explain why his grow was illegal since it is Colorado. That may be confusing
[15:49.150 --> 15:52.950]  to some folks. Uh, the article goes on to say, police say the teen showed up at a hospital
[15:53.670 --> 15:59.390]  at about a 4 15 AM Friday with a gunshot wound to his right leg. The juvenile male initially
[15:59.390 --> 16:03.070]  stated he was shot after leaving a party on the West side of Pueblo. Police said in a
[16:03.070 --> 16:08.890]  news release. However, it was later determined that he had a nut. He and another individual
[16:08.890 --> 16:13.750]  had jumped a fence into a yard on the 1600 block of Western 13th street in hopes of finding
[16:13.750 --> 16:19.750]  marijuana plants in an outdoor grow. Investigators say Vincent Duran age 55, the homeowner shot
[16:19.750 --> 16:24.390]  at the two alleged burglars striking the teen. The juvenile was treated, released
[16:24.390 --> 16:28.550]  and taken to the Pueblo youth services center where he was booked on burglary charges. Police
[16:28.550 --> 16:32.510]  say, God, imagine how that would suck, dude. You go to steal some weed or just a teenage
[16:32.510 --> 16:37.710]  kid thinking you're going to go Jackson, but they ended up shot in the leg at the hospital
[16:37.710 --> 16:43.470]  and then in fucking jail. I have no sympathy. Yeah, I don't either, but I'm relieved the
[16:43.470 --> 16:48.390]  homeowner didn't kill him. Yeah. I'm glad he didn't die. I'm glad he just got, he was
[16:48.390 --> 16:53.030]  only injured, but Jesus, this article has been all over Facebook because, um, our friends
[16:53.030 --> 16:56.830]  posted it to Facebook and shared it and people have commented fucking kid got what he had
[16:56.830 --> 17:01.310]  coming to him and people have commented. I would have shot him again. Uh, guys, this
[17:01.310 --> 17:07.150]  is cannabis. I know this is your investment. I know this is your business. Please don't
[17:07.150 --> 17:13.190]  fucking shoot people over weed. You should be growing it legally anyway. It's legal here.
[17:13.190 --> 17:16.830]  Just follow the simple rules. And if somebody is trying to steal those plants, call the
[17:16.830 --> 17:21.070]  cops. That's what they're there for. That's why legalization is beautiful is we finally
[17:21.070 --> 17:25.910]  get to use law enforcement when somebody tries to steal our weed. Yeah. And, uh, we had a
[17:25.910 --> 17:30.310]  friend recently stolen from who actually called and reported his plant stolen. And the cop
[17:30.310 --> 17:34.550]  asked him how much was that plant going to harvest you? Was it going to yield? And he
[17:34.550 --> 17:37.510]  told him how much of what would he yield? And he said, what would that cost you to buy
[17:37.510 --> 17:41.270]  at a dispensary? And he told him what that would cost per ounce. He called me and got
[17:41.270 --> 17:46.030]  a price quote, right? I told him it'd be this much per ounce, dude. And so on the police
[17:46.030 --> 17:51.730]  report, they valued each plant at what an ounce would cost at my shop. And now those
[17:51.730 --> 17:55.670]  people that will be caught because they've got video of them, they'll be charged with
[17:55.670 --> 18:00.350]  felony theft because they took over a certain amount of dollars worth of product.
[18:00.350 --> 18:05.350]  Yep. Like that's the beauty. The real beauty of legalization is that we can use courts
[18:05.350 --> 18:10.910]  and lawyers and cops. Like the violence doesn't have to exist there. That's the truth. Even
[18:10.910 --> 18:14.830]  they're in your backyard. They're stealing your shit. You guys let the dog out. Yeah.
[18:14.830 --> 18:19.830]  They let the dog out, you know, make them run. If you've got a firearm pointed at them,
[18:19.830 --> 18:25.110]  don't fucking shoot them. Nine times out of 10 it's teenagers or dipshit kids. It just
[18:25.110 --> 18:27.750]  flipped the lights on and they're going to run away. That's what I'm saying. There's
[18:27.750 --> 18:31.310]  a 17 year old boy. If you would have said, freeze, get on the ground, you could have
[18:31.310 --> 18:34.630]  called the cops. You could have dealt with it a little bit better. This dude shot a young
[18:34.630 --> 18:40.830]  kid who was running away. He was already running away. That's not cool. He was on his way out.
[18:40.830 --> 18:45.350]  Okay. Let's continue with the article. Um, where was I? Duran was arrested on suspicion
[18:45.350 --> 18:49.390]  of first degree assault and police say he'll also will be issued a summons for the marijuana
[18:49.390 --> 18:53.910]  grow. He'll also be ordered to remove the grow. Police say investigators say they are
[18:53.910 --> 19:00.230]  searching for the teen's accomplice. In August of 2014, a 13 year old boy was wounded by
[19:00.230 --> 19:05.350]  a man after allegedly trying to steal marijuana plants from a backyard. So you can see this
[19:05.350 --> 19:10.430]  is going to happen every year. If we keep having these illegal outdoor grows, just put
[19:10.430 --> 19:14.910]  it inside and put it inside. Grow indoors. Nobody can see it. If you're doing it properly,
[19:14.910 --> 19:18.670]  nobody can smell it. Nobody knows it's there. You can control it. You can grow your round,
[19:18.670 --> 19:24.470]  right? Just go get a carbon filter and a grow light and a grow book. Read the book. Listen
[19:24.470 --> 19:29.910]  to the show. Listen to the show. I know the sun is free you guys, but you got to, if it
[19:29.910 --> 19:33.710]  in the city of Pueblo, it's illegal. And if you grow and it gets something like this happens,
[19:33.710 --> 19:37.990]  it puts a black eye on our entire industry, our entire community on the plant, on the
[19:37.990 --> 19:42.190]  movement, on everything. Somebody got shot over some weed because somebody was growing
[19:42.190 --> 19:49.110]  it outside. Okay. Just for the ballpark, a decent little grow set up for six plants is
[19:49.110 --> 19:53.590]  going to run your what the best gear three grand. Oh dude, I can set you up ready to
[19:53.590 --> 19:58.070]  grow for less than a thousand bucks. Right? But like if you went with the best, like three
[19:58.070 --> 20:05.710]  or four, 25, how much would you pay to not just sweat for six months, eight months while
[20:05.710 --> 20:09.870]  your plants are out back. Right. And if someone's going to steal your effort, that's the truth.
[20:09.870 --> 20:15.150]  Like for me, it's definitely worth more than a grand or two. And if you think about it
[20:15.150 --> 20:21.350]  this way, if you're growing enough outside to make it worth shooting somebody for it,
[20:21.350 --> 20:25.210]  you are doing, you're growing more than you need. Probably. Maybe you're growing your
[20:25.210 --> 20:30.550]  entire year supply. I can't judge you, but think about the situation. If you need, if
[20:30.550 --> 20:34.790]  you're growing that much, you might be asking for something. If you're trying to get greedy,
[20:34.790 --> 20:37.750]  you might be asking, you might be inviting trouble. If you're trying to get greedy is
[20:37.750 --> 20:41.790]  what I think I'm saying. Right. This dude's going to end up harvesting enough weed to
[20:41.790 --> 20:46.990]  get him until he's got to turn himself in to go for to jail. Like it sucks. He decided
[20:46.990 --> 20:51.070]  to shoot the kid trying to steal his weed and now he's going to end up in jail for it.
[20:51.070 --> 20:54.270]  The kid's going to jail for trying to steal it. Like it's just shitty all around because
[20:54.270 --> 21:01.110]  this dude wanted to skirt the law in a place where it's legal. Now let's change. Um, let's
[21:01.110 --> 21:06.990]  just change the item being stolen from, excuse me guys. Sorry. Let's change this item from
[21:06.990 --> 21:14.990]  cannabis plants to a car. If it goes down like this, everybody's still going to jail.
[21:14.990 --> 21:21.110]  Yeah. But would you have shot at somebody stealing your car? I have a feeling this guy
[21:21.110 --> 21:25.190]  would have. Yeah. Okay. No, we had an incident in the city a couple of years ago. It got
[21:25.190 --> 21:30.310]  a whole lot of press because, uh, it was particularly brutal. This guy kind of lived in the middle
[21:30.310 --> 21:35.230]  of nowhere and had a trash pile with a bunch of scrap metal in it. And people kept pulling
[21:35.230 --> 21:39.430]  up in the middle of the night and stealing his scrap metal. So one night he got his rifle
[21:39.430 --> 21:43.470]  and turned all the lights off. And when the pickup truck showed up and people climbed
[21:43.470 --> 21:46.950]  out and turned flashlights on, he opened fire and he killed one of them, wounded another
[21:46.950 --> 21:51.190]  one held one of them at gunpoint until the cops got there and was looking at like first
[21:51.190 --> 21:56.950]  degree murder charges because that's first degree murder. Like you can't lie in wait
[21:56.950 --> 22:03.270]  and kill people. Even if they're stealing from you. Like, I don't know. It's just Pueblo
[22:03.270 --> 22:07.950]  people. It's cause, Oh man. Well this is going to happen all over the country. It just happened
[22:07.950 --> 22:14.230]  in Oregon too. Um, it's ripper season. You guys don't like, that's a big part of growing
[22:14.230 --> 22:19.590]  marijuana. It used to be because it was illegal, but it was always also because marijuana is
[22:19.590 --> 22:23.990]  worth a lot of money, especially in places where it isn't legal. And if you can steal
[22:23.990 --> 22:28.190]  it from someone, your, your cost is zero and you can take it somewhere where you can
[22:28.190 --> 22:33.390]  sell it for six, 8,000 a pound. So people are going to try to steal it. And the people
[22:33.390 --> 22:39.550]  that are going to try to steal it or shitheads. Some of these guys are professionals. I was
[22:39.550 --> 22:46.350]  told a story of somebody who got into a greenhouse with a polyvinyl cover. Um, I don't know exactly
[22:46.350 --> 22:50.110]  what that shit's called, but greenhouse covering thick covering. They cut a three foot tall
[22:50.110 --> 22:54.990]  slit in the cover, just a slit three feet tall. And they took every fucking plant out
[22:54.990 --> 23:00.710]  of the greenhouse, did not leave a footprint nor a leaf behind and cleaned the entire greenhouse
[23:00.710 --> 23:04.910]  out. Right? These guys are professionals. There are experienced rippers out there and
[23:04.910 --> 23:08.830]  they're at work all for the next week or two. Just taking crops that are finished. All right.
[23:08.830 --> 23:12.310]  I hope you guys get your plants cut down. Dude, if someone comes to steal your plants,
[23:12.310 --> 23:15.710]  please don't shoot them. Don't go to jail. Really think about it. Not worth it. Really,
[23:15.710 --> 23:18.470]  really think about what you're going to do. Do not go to jail. And earlier I said, let
[23:18.470 --> 23:22.150]  your dogs out. Um, don't let your dogs out. If you, if you let your dog out and your dog
[23:22.150 --> 23:25.710]  bites somebody, you got to put your dog down. So, and that person may shoot your dog. So
[23:25.710 --> 23:30.910]  just keep the dog in the house. Yep. Like there's a, there's really not a great option
[23:30.910 --> 23:35.270]  here. Like that's one of the things that sucks. Call the cops, call the police. Yeah. If you've
[23:35.270 --> 23:41.830]  got, if I guess so, huh. Or grow indoors. We just had a guy get shot for confronting
[23:41.830 --> 23:47.650]  some taggers in the alley. So I'm really kind of anti, you know, doing anything right now
[23:47.830 --> 23:51.850]  other than like bring in official. That's what they're there for. Just call the cops.
[23:51.850 --> 23:56.330]  Yeah. Don't try to be a vigilante. And I always hated the not doing it because I had weed.
[23:56.330 --> 24:01.530]  There were so many times where it was like I should, and I didn't because I had weed
[24:01.530 --> 24:06.090]  or smelled like weed or just smoked. Right. Yeah. Sometimes I've had to just, just call
[24:06.090 --> 24:09.090]  911 and say, Hey, there's a car upside down on the interstate. And like, why don't you
[24:09.090 --> 24:16.090]  stop? Cause I'm high as fuck. All right, you guys. Gosh, excuse my throat clearing. I'm
[24:16.130 --> 24:20.650]  going to give it one good one and I'll be done. No, that was just exaggerating. I think
[24:20.650 --> 24:25.130]  I'm good though. All right. Um, that's enough. That's the worst. That's the bad news. Let's
[24:25.130 --> 24:31.810]  find, um, this is some not great news. Yeah. Not great news. This one. Um, I am, I was
[24:31.810 --> 24:35.090]  saying that we're not going to talk about the spot on this episode, but guess what?
[24:35.090 --> 24:40.410]  The spot will be used as an example in the following. The spot, the spot passed all these
[24:40.410 --> 24:45.530]  tests with flying colors. We did not get any violations. Everything is legit at the spot.
[24:45.530 --> 24:50.650]  We are champions. So with that being said, the headline for this article is seven Denver
[24:50.650 --> 24:56.490]  marijuana shops cited for underage sales. The byline is police say they conducted checks
[24:56.490 --> 25:01.850]  on 30 Denver retail marijuana shops on Friday. I found this article on the cannabis. Uh,
[25:01.850 --> 25:07.730]  this article article is written by Jesse Paul of the Denver post. Uh, I actually first heard
[25:07.730 --> 25:12.610]  of this, uh, from our good friend Dave Munn. So shout out to Dave for putting me on the
[25:12.610 --> 25:17.770]  case to find this one. Yep. Dave's a good dude. Your nipples are sticking out, Dave.
[25:17.770 --> 25:23.130]  I just wanted to let you know. All right. So this article says that office Denver police
[25:23.130 --> 25:27.210]  issued seven citations for underage retail marijuana sales during an enforcement operation
[25:27.210 --> 25:32.130]  at 30 shops last week. Officials said on Wednesday, police say they conducted checks Friday in
[25:32.130 --> 25:36.530]  an effort to audit any potential underage sales and found there to be lower underage
[25:36.530 --> 25:39.610]  compliance rate to be a lower underage compliance rates.
[25:39.610 --> 25:44.250]  I read that wonky. Uh, we're disappointed said Lewis Koski director of Colorado's marijuana
[25:44.250 --> 25:48.730]  enforcement division in a statement up until now, these compliance checks have been a bright
[25:48.730 --> 25:56.250]  spot for the industry. This recent check drops compliance to 92%. Yeah, we were at 99 before
[25:56.250 --> 26:01.610]  fuck heads, fuck heads making us look bad. Uh, the news comes as a blow to recreational
[26:01.610 --> 26:06.650]  marijuana in Colorado, especially since the, in the roughly 21 months, months since recreational
[26:06.650 --> 26:11.050]  marijuana has been legal stores, mostly have been lauded for their compliance. Owners and
[26:11.050 --> 26:15.170]  operators have been praised for their handling of the hot button topic of underage possession
[26:15.170 --> 26:21.610]  and consumption. So in Colorado, what they're mainly worried about is this, uh, weed being
[26:21.610 --> 26:26.770]  sold to people who are not 21 and also weed being sold out the back door of the dispensary
[26:26.770 --> 26:32.650]  that isn't being documented. Yep. Underage sales and product and leaving a shop headed
[26:32.650 --> 26:39.090]  out of state, you know, in bulk in bulk is the, are, are the two things that we're really,
[26:39.090 --> 26:44.850]  really, really seeking to avoid here. They call those the fatal flaws. Yep. Those are,
[26:44.850 --> 26:49.530]  these are things that will trigger federal intervention if they get out of hand. Yes.
[26:49.530 --> 26:56.090]  Um, and I mean just in my world, all of the anti pot people love shit like this. Like
[26:56.090 --> 27:02.530]  it doesn't matter that we only drop down percentage wise to in line with alcohol and tobacco retailers.
[27:03.090 --> 27:09.650]  Like all three of those businesses, um, sit at about a 92% compliance rate, like 90 to 92. And
[27:09.650 --> 27:15.410]  we're at 92 now. Thanks to this, we were at 99 thanks to Aspen dipshits dipshits. There were two
[27:15.410 --> 27:21.330]  shops in Aspen that were busted a while ago. Um, after they were busted, pretty much every shop in
[27:21.330 --> 27:26.330]  the state got a letter saying, Hey, make sure your ID check system is up to snuff. We're doing
[27:26.330 --> 27:31.770]  compliance checks. We're not trying to scam you. Like they're not going to pretend that they're
[27:31.770 --> 27:37.370]  under 21 and show a fake ID or something. It's, it'll be an under 21 ID and you'll fuck it up.
[27:37.370 --> 27:43.530]  Yeah. That's how you get stung. And in the state of Colorado, our IDs are vertical horizontal.
[27:43.530 --> 27:47.530]  Yeah. If you're over 21, it fits one way on the card. And if you're under 21, it fits. Yeah. So
[27:47.530 --> 27:51.770]  that should be obvious. I can see you have to look at the verticals. Like I just had a family
[27:51.770 --> 27:57.130]  member turned 21 and her ID is still good for several months. So you've got to read the date,
[27:57.130 --> 28:01.690]  but how it's not hard. Happy birthday. I know who you are. Happy birthday. Everybody go get
[28:01.690 --> 28:05.850]  a little flip calendar with the, you can't buy shit here. If he was born before. Yeah.
[28:05.850 --> 28:10.010]  That's all you need. You should have somebody up front who's trained and experienced in checking
[28:10.010 --> 28:14.810]  IDs, right? We have armed security checking every ID that comes to the store and we turn away 65
[28:14.810 --> 28:19.850]  year olds all the time because their ID expired a week ago. This is how strict our shop is. And I
[28:19.850 --> 28:22.810]  know you said we weren't going to talk about the spot, but this is an example of what should be
[28:22.810 --> 28:28.490]  done. Uh, you gotta do it right. Right now. The fire inspector showed up and the fire inspector
[28:28.490 --> 28:31.850]  said, Hey, I'm here to look in the back of the building. And the security guard said, and who
[28:31.850 --> 28:35.690]  are you? And he said, I'm the fire inspector. And the security guard said, sir, can I see your ID?
[28:35.690 --> 28:39.210]  And he said, I don't have an ID. I'm the fire inspector. And the security guard stuck out his
[28:39.210 --> 28:43.370]  hand and said, I'm John. I'm the security guard. Good to meet you. Can I see your ID? And the guy
[28:43.370 --> 28:46.890]  was like, I'm the fire inspector. I don't need an ID. And he goes, I don't know who you are. You
[28:46.890 --> 28:51.130]  can't come in here and sent the fire inspector away because he didn't have proper identification.
[28:51.130 --> 28:55.610]  He was in a fire truck, but dude didn't have ID. So we can't let him in there. That's
[28:56.410 --> 29:00.490]  period. I've yeah. Period. That's the rule. You don't have ID. You can't come in. We don't care.
[29:00.490 --> 29:04.170]  You could be Barack fucking Obama. And I don't think we'd let you in there unless you pull out
[29:04.170 --> 29:10.090]  that ID. Uh, we had cops come to the shop because a crazy guy said we stole his wallet one day
[29:10.730 --> 29:14.970]  and the security guard checked their IDs. It was really funny to watch all of the
[29:14.970 --> 29:18.490]  blood tenders were standing there. Like, dude, he's really checking their IDs. It's the third
[29:18.490 --> 29:21.770]  one in a row. He's getting, he's getting his wallet out. He's pulling out his driver's license
[29:21.770 --> 29:25.210]  and giving it to our security guard. That's awesome. This is crazy. Shout out to whichever
[29:25.210 --> 29:29.690]  security guard that was. Yep. That's a good job. It's everyone that comes in gets ID. If your ID
[29:29.690 --> 29:35.050]  is expired, you can't come in. If you're not 21, you can't come in. Yep. Every shop in the legal
[29:35.050 --> 29:39.850]  industry needs to be able to do this. It's not complicated. We make vendors, uh, wait in the
[29:39.850 --> 29:44.170]  entry room if they don't have their ID with them. No, you cannot go back to the offices. You have
[29:44.170 --> 29:48.410]  to wait right here in this chair. We'll come. And then we make them wait. If they have a delivery
[29:48.410 --> 29:52.010]  for us and they don't have their ID, we handle everybody else first and then we get them. But
[29:52.010 --> 29:55.050]  all right, let's get back to this article. We were talking a little bit about the spot. We said we
[29:55.050 --> 29:59.770]  weren't gonna, we're just praising the rules that were followed in Washington state by comparison,
[29:59.770 --> 30:04.570]  which legalized recreational marijuana at the same time Colorado did, but implemented recreational
[30:04.570 --> 30:09.770]  sales six months later, several stores have been reprimanded for selling to minors. Kosky said,
[30:09.770 --> 30:14.650]  despite a lack of repeat violations at any one licensed shop, this represents a downward trend
[30:14.650 --> 30:19.850]  in compliance that is concerning. That is very true. Uh, we've been at it for just over almost
[30:19.850 --> 30:24.490]  two years now. Holy shit. Time flies. There was a lot of information in that last paragraph. They're
[30:24.490 --> 30:30.570]  re stinging, purposefully re stinging businesses that failed to make sure that they're back in
[30:30.570 --> 30:36.250]  compliance where they need to be. Yes. Um, another piece of information you might enjoy dear listeners
[30:37.130 --> 30:42.010]  is, uh, if you're a tobacco or alcohol retailer, the fines usually about 10,000,
[30:42.650 --> 30:46.410]  um, for screwing up an ID check. If you're a marijuana retailer,
[30:46.410 --> 30:50.170]  the first two penalties you face are a hundred thousand dollar fine and you can lose your
[30:50.170 --> 30:55.530]  license. A hundred thousand dollars. So it's 10 times the fine. If you screw this up as a marijuana
[30:55.530 --> 31:01.530]  business that could close a shop. Yeah, that could absolutely close a smaller dispensary that could
[31:01.530 --> 31:06.650]  shut it down. A new dispensary. They could be gone. Yeah. Ouch. I know a lot of shops that that
[31:06.650 --> 31:10.490]  would have closed down in their first year that would have closed down that Mike and I worked.
[31:10.490 --> 31:14.570]  We met each other. Well, I don't know. We, we became good friends through that probably would
[31:14.570 --> 31:17.850]  have closed Metamar that would have destroyed Metamar. They wouldn't. Yeah. A hundred thousand
[31:17.850 --> 31:21.530]  dollar fine. That would have just closed that place down. That was there. I would have been
[31:21.530 --> 31:25.290]  hungry. All right. I'm going to continue with the article here. It says when reached by phone
[31:25.290 --> 31:29.530]  representatives at five of the shop cited either declined to immediately comment or said they could
[31:29.530 --> 31:34.730]  not discuss the citations because of ongoing criminal investigations. Obviously we failed
[31:34.730 --> 31:39.770]  at our mission to keep people under 21 out of our shop. Sent Ryan Fowler owner of the cited store,
[31:39.770 --> 31:45.210]  red eye relief. I'm incredibly disappointed. I must say I like the name red eye relief. That
[31:45.210 --> 31:49.690]  sounds like something I would have said. I drive by two of these shops regularly. When I'm in
[31:49.690 --> 31:54.570]  Denver, I almost stopped at one of them. Uh, the last time I was up in Denver, just a few days ago,
[31:54.570 --> 32:00.090]  you should have stopped. They would let you in. So Fowler said foreign employees, including a store
[32:00.090 --> 32:05.210]  manager were fired in the citations wake. If he added, the shop will stop accepting vertical
[32:05.210 --> 32:09.610]  identification cards and begin using electronic verification to ensure there are no underage
[32:09.610 --> 32:14.650]  customers. So even if you're 21 and you have a vertical card, they're not going to let you win.
[32:15.850 --> 32:21.290]  Yep. Which is nonsense. You can fully let in people that are 21 and you should,
[32:21.290 --> 32:26.410]  they're perfectly legally allowed to shop in your business. Um, same thing with the electronic card
[32:26.410 --> 32:31.050]  reader. If you're, you can't look at the day and see what it says. The electronic card reader,
[32:32.010 --> 32:37.290]  that's true. It shows your age. Actually, when you slide that card reader, it shows the actual age.
[32:37.290 --> 32:42.410]  Yeah. But if you can't read a year, can you read a number at all? That's true. You guys, um, there
[32:42.410 --> 32:46.970]  are a few dispensaries. If you come to Colorado and you shop at a dispensary, um, there are a few
[32:46.970 --> 32:51.290]  that run your card through that little card reader. Like they have at the bar. That thing does
[32:51.290 --> 32:55.770]  not save any information. You guys, it does not save any information. It scans your ID and it
[32:55.770 --> 32:59.850]  processes the information on your ID. And then it shows how old you are is all it does. A lot of
[32:59.850 --> 33:03.930]  people are paranoid that that thing is showing your ID. It does not, or that it's keeping your
[33:03.930 --> 33:07.450]  information. It does not. We're not allowed. The dispensaries are not allowed to track your
[33:07.450 --> 33:13.050]  information. The only thing that we do keep track of is oftentimes dispensaries will document what
[33:13.050 --> 33:18.890]  state you are from. And that is mostly for advertising and just marketing purposes. So
[33:18.890 --> 33:22.090]  we're not keeping your information. We don't want to know where you live. We don't care.
[33:23.290 --> 33:27.690]  We're out of room for records. Not to be a dick about it, but like
[33:28.650 --> 33:33.130]  we're sort of busy. Yeah. Like we don't have time to even process that information,
[33:33.130 --> 33:37.690]  let alone compile it. A need or anything to do with it either. All right. Well, I'm going to
[33:37.690 --> 33:43.210]  get back into this article. Um, where was I? There we go. Uh, we were very concerned about
[33:43.210 --> 33:47.050]  this matter. The healing house said in a statement to the Denver post, we are 100%
[33:47.050 --> 33:51.530]  committed to compliance in all aspects of the law. We have had no issues in the past and we're
[33:51.530 --> 33:56.570]  taking this matter very seriously. Officials say the citations for selling marijuana to a person
[33:56.570 --> 34:02.490]  younger than 21 were issued at seven separate businesses. The charges, a class one misdemeanor.
[34:02.490 --> 34:07.050]  Oh, so they could also face criminal charges, huh? The person who made the sale faces has
[34:07.050 --> 34:11.210]  already been cited with a criminal, um, criminal charge and there'll be going to court for it. Now,
[34:12.330 --> 34:14.890]  I know we say, we're not going to talk about the spot, but when you walk into
[34:15.450 --> 34:20.570]  most dispensaries, there's a security guard up front checking IDs. Then he sends you back to
[34:20.570 --> 34:27.210]  the bud tender who sells you bud. Who's in, then he rings you up. Who's responsible there for that?
[34:27.210 --> 34:33.850]  The security guard or the bud tender, me, the, the, the, you should be checking an ID again.
[34:33.850 --> 34:39.770]  Uh, we're, we totally ask if we're at all worried about it. Uh, we have a lot of faith in our
[34:39.770 --> 34:46.730]  security guards. We don't at all, um, tolerate the security guard not doing his job perfectly.
[34:46.730 --> 34:51.530]  Right. There are most of those guys are, uh, they're all guys, the whole company's ex military,
[34:51.530 --> 34:57.850]  everyone in that company's event. Nice. So they're used to doing everything perfect when they have to
[34:57.850 --> 35:03.450]  at work. And so it's simply done correctly every time. Uh, we still ask from time to time. We've
[35:03.450 --> 35:08.570]  got a couple of people that come in the shop that look very, very young. Um, and they're both well
[35:08.570 --> 35:14.490]  over 21, but they don't look it. And so every time there's a new bud tender there, and even sometimes
[35:14.490 --> 35:19.050]  when, you know, there's just a lot of people there and we want everybody to be confident that
[35:19.050 --> 35:23.370]  we're not selling to under 21 people, we'll just, Hey, can I see your ID again real quick, man? I'm
[35:23.370 --> 35:28.330]  sorry. I just gotta be sure. Right. It's my butt on the line. True. Yeah. And you're way too pretty
[35:28.330 --> 35:33.290]  for jail. Yeah. It was like, I really like you dude, but you're not worth a hundred K no or your
[35:33.290 --> 35:38.730]  job. Yep. This $40 sale is not worth a hundred thousand dollar fine and my job. Right. Yeah. And
[35:38.730 --> 35:42.730]  the criminal charge. And I like being bad news. All right. I'm going to continue with the article.
[35:42.730 --> 35:45.610]  And then I just realized that at the bottom of the article, I didn't see this when I skimmed
[35:45.610 --> 35:51.210]  through this the first time all of the shops are listed. I like it. So avoid them. Yeah.
[35:51.210 --> 35:54.010]  Uh, or if you're not 21, go there and I'm just kidding. Don't do that.
[35:56.170 --> 35:59.930]  So it says those dispensaries need to be held accountable. Said Tyler Henson, president of the
[35:59.930 --> 36:04.890]  Colorado cannabis chamber of commerce. Your job as an owner and operator is to ensure your employees
[36:04.890 --> 36:10.170]  are readily trained. Uh, that can't happen again. He added, Henson said, employers and their
[36:10.170 --> 36:14.890]  employees need to understand what's at stake here. Officials say the violations can mean a
[36:14.890 --> 36:21.690]  license suspension, a fine per individual violation, a fine in lieu of suspension up to $100,000 and
[36:21.690 --> 36:27.130]  license revocation. Man, that sounds so serious when you put it like that. I mean, think about
[36:27.130 --> 36:33.450]  it, dude. What, what did the one shop down here do? They got their license pulled on-site consumption
[36:33.450 --> 36:38.010]  on-site consumption. It wasn't like they were giving out dabs in the bedroom. Nope. Uh, they
[36:38.010 --> 36:43.370]  had roaches in an employee bathroom and it was enough for them to lose two store licenses,
[36:44.250 --> 36:50.410]  underage sales. They haven't closed the shop that I know of yet, but I don't think any of the cases
[36:50.410 --> 36:56.730]  that have screwed this up have gone through that process completely yet. Time will tell it's brand
[36:56.730 --> 37:01.610]  new. Yep. Um, my guess is a couple of people are going to lose their license. If you get stung
[37:01.610 --> 37:06.010]  twice, I would bet on it. Oh yeah. Twice they should. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, so it says sanctions may
[37:06.010 --> 37:10.890]  also include restrictions on the license. Police said in a news release, investigators say they
[37:10.890 --> 37:15.290]  will file the cases with the Denver city attorney's office, which could issue its own discipline,
[37:15.290 --> 37:19.690]  ranging from license suspension to license revocation. According to the Colorado department
[37:19.690 --> 37:25.610]  of revenue, the marijuana enforcement division has conducted 172 compliance checks since January
[37:25.610 --> 37:35.290]  1st of 2014 and found 16 total violations. Uh, so it goes on to say Denver marijuana shops were
[37:35.290 --> 37:41.210]  cited, uh, where citations were issued and then it lists them. It says the herbal cure on South
[37:41.210 --> 37:48.170]  Logan street, the healing house on South Downing, pure medical dispensary on 40th Avenue, Le Conte's
[37:48.170 --> 37:54.730]  clone bar and dispensary on East seventh. Uh, that's over by where they host the cannabis cup,
[37:54.730 --> 38:00.730]  uh, herbs for you on East ninth mile high green cross. Those guys have a cannabis cup. So does
[38:00.730 --> 38:05.290]  Le Conte's. Uh, there are a couple of places on here that have cannabis cups that are professionals
[38:05.290 --> 38:10.010]  that have a reputation that are fucking up. I don't know how the fuck some of these shops mess
[38:10.010 --> 38:16.730]  this up. Uh, red eye relief on South Cherokee street. You know, we can chalk a couple of them
[38:16.730 --> 38:22.490]  up to a lazy employee or some buddy up at the front, not giving a shit and you just hand them
[38:22.490 --> 38:28.170]  an ID and like they look, I've been not old enough and gotten into clubs just by handing the bouncer
[38:28.170 --> 38:32.970]  an ID here. And it was my ID that said I was not 21 and he's like, Oh, you got an ID here and just
[38:32.970 --> 38:36.410]  hands it back. Cause like you said, some people aren't fucking smart enough to read an ID to
[38:36.410 --> 38:41.450]  figure out that 1970 whatever means you're this, how old, you know, people can't do that math in
[38:41.450 --> 38:46.250]  their head sometimes. So we can give a couple of those just to dumb employees. Some of it's just
[38:46.250 --> 38:50.330]  one of them, one or two is probably just somebody letting somebody slip through just need to make
[38:50.490 --> 38:58.010]  a sales. Like, I don't know what it is, but if you, if the, if selling to people under 21 as part
[38:58.010 --> 39:03.610]  of your business model, you can go, yeah, then we're trying to set a positive standard here and
[39:03.610 --> 39:09.210]  do things correctly. We're literally front and center on the world stage when other nations
[39:09.850 --> 39:15.930]  bring up marijuana legalization, um, as an idea or a concept that they might want to pursue.
[39:15.930 --> 39:22.410]  They discuss what's happening in Colorado. Yes, we are the mom every now and then I hear about
[39:22.410 --> 39:28.330]  someone from France or London, um, coming through Pueblo and taking a look at what we're doing here
[39:28.970 --> 39:32.730]  in Pueblo, which this never would have happened five years ago. There's no reason for any of these
[39:32.730 --> 39:37.610]  people to be here and be interested in what we're doing, but they're coming here to see how marijuana
[39:37.610 --> 39:45.770]  legalization works in practice. And if they see teenagers waiting in line, it's not going well.
[39:45.850 --> 39:50.570]  It's not going to spread and it should. That's the truth. All right, you guys, we've got one
[39:50.570 --> 39:54.250]  more article that I want to get in. We've been going for close to 40 minutes. We can get this
[39:54.250 --> 39:57.850]  one in here. No, I like it. The people seem to like, uh, when I've got somebody else with me,
[39:57.850 --> 40:01.850]  they'll listen a little longer. So when it's just me, about 36 minutes is the limit. When there's
[40:01.850 --> 40:07.370]  two of us, they'll listen. That's good news times. So let's start this one off with a big, uh,
[40:07.370 --> 40:14.730]  congratulations to Oregon. Yeah. Oregon enters recreational era with tax-free pot sales.
[40:14.730 --> 40:19.690]  October 1st documented the beginning of a recreational pot sales in the state of Oregon.
[40:19.690 --> 40:24.490]  I've got a lot of friends out there. A big shout out to my Oregon crew, the PNW crew. Hope you guys
[40:24.490 --> 40:29.370]  are out there enjoying recreational cannabis sales. So I've got an article once again,
[40:29.370 --> 40:34.570]  from the cannabis. This was written by Jonathan J. Cooper and Bob Sevey of the Associated Press.
[40:35.850 --> 40:42.170]  It's like a cool pair of names, Jonathan J. Cooper and Bob Sevey. Yeah. All right.
[40:42.170 --> 40:46.010]  Just when I think I was going to ready for another dab, you say some really high
[40:46.010 --> 40:48.890]  shit and remind me why that's probably not a great idea. You want to take a dab? Fuck it.
[40:48.890 --> 40:53.610]  Let's take a dab, dude. Let's celebrate Oregon's recreational cannabis by taking a dab. Yeah.
[40:53.610 --> 40:58.010]  That's good to me. Consider my arm twisted. Yeah. I'll twist the shit out of it. Um, we've got two
[40:58.010 --> 41:01.850]  rigs on the table. I'll let you hit the email and then I'll go ahead and take the one that requires
[41:01.850 --> 41:06.490]  a torch. You got a dab over there. You need a carb cap. I'm going to take myself a medium,
[41:06.490 --> 41:12.090]  shmedium dab. Hey guys, I want you to, uh, take a dab with me first of all, but then I want you
[41:12.250 --> 41:18.010]  to find me on social media, either Facebook or Twitter, or you can even email me you want,
[41:18.010 --> 41:24.010]  if you want, but I want to know how big of a dab do you take? Do you take a 0.1? Do you take a 0.2?
[41:24.010 --> 41:30.810]  Do you take a 0.3? Do you take 0.4 or do you do a fucking half gram dab? Tell me what you think.
[41:30.810 --> 41:35.130]  I want to know about it. Uh, it's grow from your heart at hotmail.com. You can find me on Facebook
[41:35.130 --> 41:39.930]  is grow from your heart. Or if you want to search me out on Twitter, find me on the little Twitter.
[41:39.930 --> 41:43.850]  It's a at GFYH podcast. Let me know how big of a dab you prefer to take.
[41:44.410 --> 41:49.130]  So you're looking for regular dab size. Not this one time my friend dared me to take a,
[41:49.690 --> 41:53.530]  well, I want to know. Yeah. Yeah. Like what, if you're about to just pull off a dab for yourself,
[41:53.530 --> 41:56.650]  if it's your normal day, if your dad, but I want to know what you pull off, what's your average.
[41:56.650 --> 42:01.450]  And then tell me how many of those you take in a dab session also, because if you take a half gram
[42:01.450 --> 42:06.970]  and you only take one of them, then that's cool. If you take 5.1, that's cool. Also, I just want
[42:06.970 --> 42:14.410]  to know how you do it. I'm just curious. I myself like to take a whole bunch of 0.3. Like 0.3 is
[42:14.410 --> 42:18.250]  about where I like to be. And I like to take a bunch of like about six or seven of them. Sometimes
[42:18.250 --> 42:23.370]  on a lunch break, I'll take 3.3 is what I like for a lunch break. I'm going to take a dab right
[42:23.370 --> 42:31.140]  now. Right now I'm hitting the hit man. Let's do this. Oh, that hits really well. You all remember
[42:31.140 --> 42:39.060]  how bad I cough? No cough, a little cough. So recently I picked up a mothership knockoff.
[42:39.060 --> 42:45.140]  It's not really, it looks just like a mothership Klein, but it was a thinner, I think. Yeah. The
[42:45.140 --> 42:48.980]  glass may be a little thinner. Not the, not so much the, well, yeah, maybe a little bit,
[42:48.980 --> 42:54.420]  the glass way too, but the overall size of the rig, the cylinder going up is, is thinner in
[42:54.420 --> 43:00.020]  diameter. Okay. Yeah. It may be a little bit shrunken of a ship, but it was a fifth of the
[43:00.020 --> 43:04.420]  price of a mothership. Right. It hits like a truck. I like it a lot. It's a great rig. So
[43:04.420 --> 43:07.780]  shout out to elevate in Colorado Springs. I know I've said that once or twice this show, but
[43:08.420 --> 43:12.740]  I've been buying a lot of glass from them and I appreciate the hookups. This little hit man
[43:12.740 --> 43:16.580]  hits like a goddamn truck. I'm trying to act like I'm not trying to choke and trying to act like
[43:16.580 --> 43:20.180]  I've got my breath together and everything, but guess what? There's almost no resistance. It's
[43:20.180 --> 43:25.060]  straight from nail to lung. Oh, that, yeah. There's some chokages. You just get a fat rip
[43:25.060 --> 43:29.220]  every time. So I feel like I'm getting my brains back together. Uh, sometimes you guys, when I take
[43:29.220 --> 43:32.660]  a big dab, it sounds like Charlie Brown's, uh, the adults in the Charlie Brown cartoons,
[43:35.780 --> 43:39.940]  is what it sounds like after a big dab. Sometimes it takes me a minute to dig through that hole,
[43:40.580 --> 43:45.140]  but I feel like I'm back. We are celebrating Oregon having recreational sales of cannabis,
[43:45.140 --> 43:51.060]  right? Welcome to the club. You're the cool kids. All right, let's get into this article.
[43:51.940 --> 43:56.180]  This is from Portland, Oregon, and it says excited shoppers looking to score some of the first
[43:56.180 --> 44:01.620]  recreational marijuana sold legally in Oregon, bought up baggies of bud early Thursday, taking
[44:01.620 --> 44:08.100]  advantage of door buster prices and other deals. Goddamn. That's such a poetic opening line for a
[44:08.100 --> 44:15.700]  news article. Whoever wrote this is majestic or I'm high. Uh, some of the more than 250 dispensaries
[44:15.700 --> 44:20.420]  that already offer medical marijuana in the state welcomed recreational users soon after midnight,
[44:20.420 --> 44:25.780]  just moments after it became legal to sell to anyone who is at least 21. It's a really long
[44:25.780 --> 44:32.420]  sentences in this article. Uh, so much for the majesty, right? Uh, Shongo premium cannabis in
[44:32.420 --> 44:37.700]  Portland, uh, co-founder Shane McKee said the first sale came about a minute after midnight and many
[44:37.700 --> 44:43.060]  others quickly followed. I think it's not only historical for folks in Oregon, but nationwide.
[44:43.060 --> 44:47.620]  Anytime people start selling that as an alternative to alcohol or tobacco, he said in a telephone
[44:47.620 --> 44:53.540]  interview, Brad Sussman, co-owner of Canada daddies in Portland said more than 90 customers bought pot
[44:53.540 --> 44:58.740]  in the first two hours after the store opened at 7 a.m. So people are out there at midnight
[44:58.740 --> 45:03.540]  buying weed out there at 7 a.m. buying weed. That's pretty neat. It's like when a new video
[45:03.540 --> 45:07.540]  game goes on sale, something like that lines out the door. People just buy and weed.
[45:08.820 --> 45:16.900]  I'm torn with this story. Um, I, first I'm elated that another state has joined the legalization
[45:16.900 --> 45:23.380]  ranks. Um, I'm glad they they're celebrating. I'm glad people came out and that the lines were good
[45:23.940 --> 45:29.060]  a lot of medical shops are converting. So supply might not be the problem. It's been another legal
[45:29.060 --> 45:34.420]  States, which is awesome. Um, but at the same time, it's time to knock off the shenanigans
[45:34.420 --> 45:38.100]  and step all the way up into the legal industry. You got to put your best foot forward. Are you
[45:38.100 --> 45:42.660]  going to fuck it up for everyone? And there were a couple of things about the rollout in Oregon that
[45:43.300 --> 45:49.860]  could fuck it up for most of Oregon. Half of the state has banned shops period. Um,
[45:49.860 --> 45:54.340]  the other half of the state allows a shitload. And if you look at a map, it's like right down
[45:54.340 --> 45:59.540]  the fucking mountain range in the middle of the state. Um, the coast side approves and
[45:59.540 --> 46:04.580]  there's shops everywhere that the other side of the mountain range, not a single shop of course.
[46:04.580 --> 46:11.220]  Um, and stuff like opening at midnight when there are hours that you're allowed to open
[46:11.220 --> 46:17.540]  and not allowed to be open and they don't involve 12 or one in the morning. Um, there's, uh,
[46:17.540 --> 46:21.300]  the main reporter covering marijuana out there that I follow on Twitter.
[46:21.300 --> 46:26.740]  One of her colleagues was handed marijuana gummies, um, outside of the shop, waiting in line,
[46:26.740 --> 46:32.180]  doing news reports. He was just handed free pot, candy pot, edibles, specifically candy or fucking
[46:32.180 --> 46:42.020]  band. So we're giveaways like, and it's not like this stuff is world. I mean, it's a celebration.
[46:42.180 --> 46:47.460]  Shenanigans happen. Um, there was a truck driving up and down the street, not at all affiliated
[46:47.460 --> 46:51.940]  with the dispensary we were waiting in line at on January 1st. It was giving out plants, right? It
[46:51.940 --> 46:56.420]  was the funniest shit ever. The guy in a truck, he drove by and threw out bags of edibles. Uh,
[46:56.420 --> 47:03.140]  he drove by and gave out plants. Yeah. I'm 90% sure it was somebody advertising for another shop
[47:03.140 --> 47:07.940]  that was not at all getting business, but it might've just been one of us who had blown his
[47:07.940 --> 47:12.580]  stack with joy. Um, it could've gone either way. I didn't get up close and investigate cause I
[47:12.580 --> 47:17.460]  didn't want to lose my awesome spot in line. Right. Um, cause by then I was halfway through
[47:17.460 --> 47:25.620]  a two hour line. Um, but there's some shenanigans to be expected, but it's day four or seven now or
[47:25.620 --> 47:31.700]  whatever, whenever this is going to air, we've had a week now, every ID gets checked. Every rule
[47:31.700 --> 47:35.860]  gets followed. If you've got a problem with the rule, get a lobbyist and get a lawyer,
[47:36.420 --> 47:40.900]  change the rules at the state level so that they work better for everybody. You should already have
[47:40.900 --> 47:48.820]  a lawyer fucking skirted, right? Different kinds of lawyers. But yeah, it's, it's really important
[47:48.820 --> 47:54.100]  now that, um, if you're in the legal industry that you step all the way up, we have to put our best
[47:54.100 --> 47:59.220]  foot forward right now. Every state, you guys, every state in every upcoming state, this applies
[47:59.220 --> 48:04.740]  to if the medical shops in California had it all tried to put their best foot forward ever
[48:05.460 --> 48:10.020]  from 1996 till now, it would have been fucking legal a decade ago, bitches.
[48:10.020 --> 48:15.460]  But I mean, just like in Colorado, we had to deal with Dr. Reifer. Um, the Boulder city council
[48:15.460 --> 48:20.900]  right now is talking about dialing regulations back down to reality because we've gotten rid of,
[48:20.900 --> 48:26.020]  and I fucking quote the Dr. Reifers of this world. Like they're done now. They're all out
[48:26.020 --> 48:29.620]  of business talking about how they used to own a dispensary. You don't even know that one of my
[48:29.620 --> 48:34.580]  buddies owned a shop called Dr. Reifer in Colorado Springs. Do you know, remember the kid that used
[48:34.580 --> 48:41.380]  to sell us the Hindu Kush vaguely, uh, Dr. Reifer? Um, there was a, the Dr. Reifer in question is
[48:41.380 --> 48:46.980]  the one up in Boulder. He had a twirling sign guy and that's what everyone in Boulder was fired up
[48:46.980 --> 48:51.700]  about is his wildly inappropriate twirling sign. Yeah. We can't have a twirling sign guys in
[48:51.700 --> 48:55.860]  Colorado. Specifically banned because of this buck. You can, you can twirling sign for your
[48:55.860 --> 49:00.900]  tax return place. You can twirling sign for cheeseburgers. Uh, you can twirling sign for
[49:00.900 --> 49:06.980]  El Pollo Loco, but not for cannabis. You can't eat for your vape shop. Yep. Yep. Yep. All right.
[49:06.980 --> 49:11.060]  We're way off topic here. I'm going to get, this article has more words written in it and they say,
[49:11.060 --> 49:15.380]  he said, customers told them they've been writing, waiting all their lives for a moment like this.
[49:15.380 --> 49:20.740]  They expected to sell $60,000 worth of marijuana throughout the day. There were no reports of
[49:20.740 --> 49:24.980]  arrests or other problems involving the early sales in the state. Most stores planned to open
[49:24.980 --> 49:29.860]  later in the day. Oregon is one of four States that have legalized the sale of recreational
[49:29.860 --> 49:34.900]  marijuana. Business began in Oregon with far more dispensaries than did Colorado or Washington
[49:34.900 --> 49:40.340]  state where pot shops have been up and running for more than a year. Alaska could begin retail
[49:40.340 --> 49:46.100]  sales next year. Big shout out to Charlo Green, uh, Foster Buds, PDX. She might be going to jail.
[49:46.100 --> 49:50.420]  You've been following that story. No, she has not. Or I have not. Her outfit keeps getting
[49:50.420 --> 49:56.180]  raided because as you said, shops not till whenever they're trying to do like a distribution
[49:56.180 --> 50:01.140]  club of some kind. Yeah. Yeah. Charlo, take care of yourself. Beautiful. Don't end up in jail. We
[50:01.140 --> 50:06.180]  need you out there fighting the good fight for us. Um, where am I? Foster Buds and PDA, uh, Foster
[50:06.180 --> 50:10.420]  Buds, PDX in Portland had a couple hundred customers since opening just after midnight
[50:10.420 --> 50:15.700]  shop manager. Ken Martin said, it's just been a steady flow. He said, adding that employees
[50:15.700 --> 50:20.900]  repeatedly refill jars with pop to meet the demand. Two customers came in used to that
[50:20.900 --> 50:24.500]  shit people. Oh yeah. Just keep filling those jars. You'll get used to that.
[50:24.580 --> 50:28.820]  Writing down how much came out of the bag, which bag number, which jar it went into. Yep. Keep
[50:28.820 --> 50:33.460]  going. I've watched it a billion times. Uh, two customers who came in had just turned 21. He said
[50:34.020 --> 50:39.060]  Davia Fleming. Uh, I don't know if I read your name, right? Davia, Davia, Davia Fleming of Portland.
[50:39.060 --> 50:42.900]  The first buyer in the key store said the atmosphere was upbeat for the launch of the new
[50:42.900 --> 50:48.980]  industry. It's the end of a prohibition said Fleming who uses the drug for medicinal purposes.
[50:48.980 --> 50:52.900]  Uh, you guys, have I ever mentioned that I was the first person to buy recreational cannabis at
[50:52.900 --> 50:58.340]  the greener side dispensary in Pueblo, Colorado? Woo. I was first bitches. Anyway, I'm pretty sure
[50:58.340 --> 51:03.700]  I talked about that. It was like way long time ago. Uh, the store offered its first 25 customers,
[51:03.700 --> 51:09.860]  35 to 40% discounts and was handing out soda, coffee, juice, and other refreshments. McKee said
[51:09.860 --> 51:14.180]  many stores in Oregon were trying to lure customers with extended hours, food giveaways,
[51:14.180 --> 51:20.340]  and discounted marijuana shoppers who have, uh, shoppers have one more incentive to buy early.
[51:20.340 --> 51:25.860]  And often under Oregon law, popular purchases will be tax-free until January the savings of
[51:25.860 --> 51:30.900]  up to 20%. That's a good way to do it. Get people to come in and see how it goes and then start
[51:30.900 --> 51:35.620]  charging tax. That's pretty nice. The one thing I really like about Oregon's law is they're really
[51:35.620 --> 51:40.740]  looking to kick the black market in the balls. Nice. So no taxes for the first little bit. So,
[51:40.740 --> 51:47.620]  you know, it's the old street theory that they threw at us in middle school and you get a taste
[51:47.700 --> 51:52.580]  of cheap. Yep. You want a free joint? Welcome to the selection. Welcome to the quality control.
[51:52.580 --> 51:57.380]  Welcome to the quality increases. Welcome to the guy being here on time. We'll hit you in the nuts
[51:57.380 --> 52:03.220]  with the taxes. Minyana. Yep. Yep. Yep. No more watching how it's made for two hours so that it
[52:03.220 --> 52:07.140]  doesn't look like foot traffic. None of that. Just walk in, have your mind blown with awesome
[52:07.140 --> 52:11.700]  weed product and then balance. Right. All right. The article goes on to say store owners say they
[52:11.700 --> 52:15.620]  are hopeful they can avoid the shortages and price spikes that followed the start of legal
[52:15.620 --> 52:20.580]  sales last year in Washington and Colorado. Alaska could begin retail sales next year. I
[52:20.580 --> 52:26.100]  think I already read that, huh? One store offered a goodie bag with t-shirts, but no free marijuana.
[52:26.100 --> 52:31.300]  It sounds like the spot. Another will have a live band and 10% discounts. Several stores have
[52:31.300 --> 52:36.260]  erected billboards in Portland. A shop in Merlin is advertising on the radio. I'm just trying to
[52:36.260 --> 52:40.420]  basically stock up for maybe four or five times what the normal volume would be, said Chris Byers,
[52:40.420 --> 52:45.460]  owner of River City Dispensary in Merlin. Customers can buy as much as seven grams at a time of
[52:45.460 --> 52:50.980]  dried marijuana, flour and leaf. The part that's generally smoked plus plants and seeds,
[52:52.500 --> 52:57.540]  dried flour and leaf. Hopefully there's not a lot of leaf in there. Yeah. Basically buds is what
[52:57.540 --> 53:02.340]  they mean. Yeah. Some of the, some of the people that write weed articles need to hang out with
[53:02.340 --> 53:08.260]  some weed heads, right? For the next year or so pot infused candy, cookies, oils, and lotions
[53:08.260 --> 53:12.420]  will be available only to people with medical marijuana cards as the state works on retail
[53:12.500 --> 53:17.620]  regulations for those products. Oregon has a robust supply supply system that has supported
[53:17.620 --> 53:22.660]  medical marijuana users and the black market. Companies have invested in massive warehouses
[53:22.660 --> 53:28.020]  in Portland to grow the drug indoors and Southern Oregon has some of the nation's best conditions
[53:28.020 --> 53:33.620]  for outdoor cultivation. Growers don't face strict regulations yet. So the supply can more easily
[53:33.620 --> 53:38.980]  flow into retail stores than it did in Washington and Colorado. Still, there is concern. Summer has
[53:38.980 --> 53:43.220]  historically been a time of marijuana shortages in Oregon and most of the outdoor crop that is
[53:43.220 --> 53:48.100]  ready to heart. And most of the outdoor crop is not ready to harvest. Sorry, I skipped a word there.
[53:48.100 --> 53:52.420]  Indoor growers have had minimal time to ramp up production because lawmakers only approved the
[53:52.420 --> 53:57.780]  October 1st start date three months ago. And they had time to get one quick crop in. We have kind of
[53:57.780 --> 54:03.220]  a seasonal growing market here in Oregon. Yeah, I know, I know, I know. Said Jeremy Pratt. He said,
[54:03.220 --> 54:08.020]  we kind of have a seasonal growing market here in Oregon. Said the owner of Nectar Cannabis,
[54:08.020 --> 54:12.500]  which has four stores in Portland. We have lots of products in the fall, and then it kind of gets
[54:12.500 --> 54:18.180]  tight this time of year. Anyway, Reno Oasis, which has two locations in Portland and more on the way,
[54:18.180 --> 54:22.980]  has prepared by trying to cultivate strong relationships with growers. It will entice
[54:22.980 --> 54:27.940]  customers Thursday evening with an outdoor band and offer 10% discounts to those who spend at
[54:27.940 --> 54:33.140]  least $40. Co-owner Matthew Schwimmer said, we don't know of anyone else doing a band,
[54:33.140 --> 54:37.380]  and we thought it was a good idea to give back to the community, Schwimmer said.
[54:37.940 --> 54:41.220]  So that's the article, you guys. Big congratulations to the state of Oregon.
[54:41.220 --> 54:46.740]  They have now got recreational cannabis sales. It is tax-free until January. So if you're doing the
[54:46.740 --> 54:51.780]  circuit, make sure you go stop in Oregon. Make sure you get yourself... Is that where the fucking
[54:51.780 --> 54:56.260]  donut shop is that everybody talks about? That's where those donuts are. God, go get some tasty
[54:56.260 --> 55:01.300]  donuts. And then go get yourself some recreational cannabis. Shout out the donuts. I've been eating
[55:01.300 --> 55:05.620]  too many donuts lately. But shout out to donuts. Go get yourself some recreational cannabis in the
[55:05.620 --> 55:10.900]  state of Oregon, you guys. Yeah, make sure you're 21 and make sure they check your ID. And if they
[55:10.900 --> 55:13.860]  don't check your ID, call them out on it and tell them that they're not following the rules. They're
[55:13.860 --> 55:20.180]  going to fuck it up for the future. If you listen to the show and you haven't had a chance to legally
[55:20.180 --> 55:26.340]  purchase cannabis, start saving for a plane ticket. If you're 21. If you're 21. If you're 21.
[55:26.340 --> 55:33.060]  It'll just change your world. When I think of what I used to deal with to buy weed,
[55:33.940 --> 55:40.420]  like what was just standard when I was in high school and in college and then in my 20s,
[55:41.060 --> 55:46.420]  it was just a nightmare, especially in retrospect. Like it was just life when it was happening. It
[55:46.420 --> 55:53.860]  wasn't that bad. Like I didn't mind watching how it's made that much. But now that it's totally
[55:53.860 --> 55:57.860]  legal and I work in a pot shop and it's just like picking up a cheeseburger on the way home,
[55:58.980 --> 56:03.700]  it's so much better. Yeah. I was afraid of it at first.
[56:04.580 --> 56:09.460]  It's so much better. I can't adequately put it into words. Well, I came from the black market
[56:09.460 --> 56:16.580]  and I was afraid of all of this. And it's, I don't know, freaky to a lot of people. It's a huge
[56:16.580 --> 56:22.900]  change. If you live in a non-legal state, you worry about when you, I don't know how much weed
[56:22.900 --> 56:26.660]  you buy, but when half of it is gone, you start thinking about, fuck, where am I going to get more
[56:26.660 --> 56:31.620]  weed? Because there's no reliable spot. I never have to think, where am I going to get my next bag
[56:31.620 --> 56:40.020]  of weed? Because if I don't grow it, I can go to the shop at which I work, or I can drive to one of
[56:40.020 --> 56:44.500]  my other buddies' shops, or I can drive to one of my other friends' shops, or I'm also a medical
[56:44.500 --> 56:49.060]  marijuana patient. So I could drive to a medical dispensary. Excuse me, I'm trying to burp.
[56:49.060 --> 56:53.780]  I could drive to a medical marijuana shop and get whatever cannabis I need in there.
[56:53.780 --> 56:58.260]  So it is a little bit better that way. It made herb more available, way more available. It made
[56:58.260 --> 57:03.620]  weed more advanced. The innovations that have come with this legalization have been incredible.
[57:04.420 --> 57:08.820]  So I like it. I think it's way better, but I feared this.
[57:08.820 --> 57:12.980]  It's so much better. Legalization is beautiful. We can do so many things.
[57:13.620 --> 57:21.700]  I never had trouble finding pot before in my life. It never came up. I might have trouble
[57:21.700 --> 57:27.540]  locating good pot or the same pot, and it was always horseshit whatever you bought. It was
[57:27.540 --> 57:32.900]  never what they said it was. You'd ask, do you have any of this? And they'd go, oh yeah. And
[57:32.900 --> 57:38.420]  they'd go get a handful of something different and be like, this is the name you said. And you
[57:39.380 --> 57:43.940]  just believed it. That was the best you had. Hopefully you weren't getting cheated.
[57:44.740 --> 57:52.420]  And that was just life. Now there's 10 stores within a 15 minute drive from both our homes.
[57:53.140 --> 57:56.340]  And that's pretty much true across Colorado at this point.
[57:56.340 --> 57:59.700]  And you can go to two or three of them and see what you do and don't like.
[57:59.700 --> 58:03.300]  Every shop's got different pricing. Every shop's got a different selection.
[58:04.100 --> 58:08.660]  And there are major companies across Colorado where you can find their stuff everywhere.
[58:09.940 --> 58:13.060]  Sort of like Coke and Pepsi. You don't have to go to a Coca-Cola store.
[58:13.060 --> 58:16.740]  Yeah, Chibuchews for example. Chibuchews, Incredibles. They're in almost every shop.
[58:16.740 --> 58:22.100]  Edapure. There's a handful of major edible companies that are everywhere now.
[58:22.660 --> 58:29.620]  I feel bad for the delivery people. That's a lot of paperwork. Dixie. There's a bunch of them.
[58:30.260 --> 58:36.420]  And it's just beautiful. You walk in and there's 30, 40, sometimes only five or six,
[58:36.420 --> 58:40.900]  but there's a selection of buds. You get to look at them, smell them. You get to know the price.
[58:41.940 --> 58:45.380]  It's not weird that you drove to someone's house and spent 20 minutes in their living room and you
[58:45.380 --> 58:49.780]  don't want to buy this. You can just, thanks and leave. Yeah. If you go to a dispensary and you
[58:49.780 --> 58:52.820]  don't like what's in there, you can leave. You don't have to buy anything there.
[58:52.820 --> 58:56.500]  Yeah. People ask me what the minimum purchase is and it's like nothing. If you don't
[58:56.580 --> 59:02.180]  want any of this, please. You don't have to buy. I'll show you around everything and you can leave
[59:02.180 --> 59:07.780]  knowing what's going on. And then go look at a few other places. You can buy nothing. Half the
[59:07.780 --> 59:11.620]  time when you do that, I give you a coupon book with everybody in the town listed. There you go.
[59:13.620 --> 59:16.900]  Guys, don't feel obligated to buy something if you're in a dispensary and you don't like what
[59:16.900 --> 59:21.540]  you see. That's your money. You work for that. You're not wasting their time. That's a store.
[59:21.540 --> 59:25.860]  You can go in there and do what you need to do. If you're a marijuana fan, you're going to like
[59:25.860 --> 59:30.500]  what you see in almost any shop you go to, especially if it's the first shop you go to.
[59:31.140 --> 59:36.420]  Uh, I went, I was, um, in Colorado Springs hiking one day and I had a friend with me. I had hash
[59:36.420 --> 59:40.740]  with me. I just travel with dabs. I don't usually take flowers with me. Uh, we call the, you guys
[59:40.740 --> 59:46.020]  that aren't Colorado connoisseurs. Uh, we call the buds. We just call it flowers. No, I didn't have
[59:46.020 --> 59:51.060]  any flowers with me and somebody wanted to smoke some weed. And so we're driving and I was like,
[59:51.060 --> 59:55.380]  look at dispensary. And we pull up, dude, I would not smoke anything in that fucking place.
[59:55.940 --> 59:59.620]  You could not have paid me to smoke anything in there. I fucking left. I was like, Nope,
[59:59.620 --> 01:00:05.060]  no thanks. I'm like, what's wrong. And I was like, it all smells exactly the same. Like there's no
[01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:09.460]  difference on any of these strains. Like it was, yeah, I just left. I didn't need anything out of
[01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:17.540]  there. I've left many, many a shop. Just some of them aren't up to par. Some of them only still
[01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:24.740]  exist because enough of the population legitimately had to stop smoking weed 30 years ago because it
[01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:30.740]  was too risky for them. And only now that they're retiring and that their kids are grown, are they
[01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:35.300]  getting out and trying to buy weed again? I mean, for 30 years, they didn't know who to call and
[01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:40.020]  were too worried about asking their friends and neighbors about losing their jobs or custody of
[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:45.460]  their kids or whatever. Yup. They just didn't. And now they can just pull up to a shop, walk in,
[01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:50.980]  ask for an eighth. I turn on the people I talk to every day, have super silver hair and huge smiles.
[01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:55.700]  I've been working outside of the shop lately at my job that I've been doing is just required
[01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:58.980]  some cleaning of some shit that's taken about a week. And I've been out in the back with the door
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:03.060]  open and I see a lot of people walk by because there's a parking area over there and they walk
[01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:09.300]  by me. Most of the people that I see are older folks. It's not a lot of young punks buying weed.
[01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:12.260]  It's older folks that used to smoke back in the day. Like you're saying,
[01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:16.980]  that have kids that are in college now. Like, yeah, you see them come in and you see
[01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:23.300]  a 20 something college kid come in with his mom or his dad and they go buy weed together. And I
[01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:28.580]  think it's really funny to see that shit. Most of the 21, 22 year old people I see are on family
[01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:35.540]  vacation. That's awesome. Yeah. It's a lot of fun. We get a lot of younger people too, but
[01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:41.380]  definitely the tourist economy is, is retirees. If you think about it, it makes sense. If you're
[01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:47.140]  22, there's no reason to fly to Colorado to buy weed except for the enjoyment of buying legal
[01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:51.380]  cannabis and getting to see what the selection and the hype's all about. Because you know,
[01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:57.620]  30 people that's were happy to sell you a bag of weed or at least one or two. There's no reason
[01:01:57.620 --> 01:02:03.300]  to come here and spend the money on the flight for what you can do at home already. But if you're 65,
[01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:08.900]  there's still a lot of risk in Oklahoma. And there's none here. And it just blows people
[01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:14.660]  away. I hear that at least twice, three times a week. No, where I'm from, this is, this is really
[01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:18.740]  frowned upon. We would get in so much trouble for this. Everyone would think bad about us if they
[01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:23.300]  knew that we were here doing this. Like, please don't tell my friends and family. And it's like,
[01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:27.540]  lady, you're from Georgia. I don't know. None of your people. I don't know. None of your people.
[01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:32.020]  I'm not going to call your congregation and be like, watch the security footage. She bought a
[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:35.620]  chocolate bar with weed in it. You guys, if you come here and you get some weed, don't try to
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:40.580]  take it home. Smoke it all here. Smoke it all here. If you can't finish it, call me. You can
[01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:44.980]  drop it off at my spot. There are a lot of locals that are happy to help you finish the bag you
[01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:50.340]  overpurchased. It is, it is legal to give your weed away to somebody who is over 21. If you've
[01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:53.300]  got cannabis and you bought it in Colorado, and you're about to get on the flight and you're about
[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:57.700]  to fly home, or you're about to drive back across the border, stop at the last gas station in
[01:02:57.700 --> 01:03:01.300]  Colorado before you hit the border or fucking while you're at the airport, you see some dude
[01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:06.180]  with some dreadlocks and just try not to give it to someone who's at work. That's a good idea.
[01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:10.580]  Don't get well, unless it's me. Cause I can take weed. I can't actually, if they have dreadlocks,
[01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:14.260]  that last statement doesn't apply. Right. Yeah. So yeah, if you're, if you're walking through the
[01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:18.100]  airport and you got extra weed on you and you see somebody with dreadlocks, they just flew in and
[01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:22.580]  they need some weed, just hand them your bag. Maybe I should rephrase that. Like, okay. So
[01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:27.940]  the guy that works at McDonald's really wants your unfinished bag of weed. He could really use that
[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:33.220]  kind of charity and, and sort of pat on the back. But if you give it to him at the drive-through
[01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:39.380]  window, he's going to get fired. You were trying to do something nice. So have him meet you outside
[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:46.420]  real quick. Yeah. Yeah. Catch him in the parking lot. We've gotten way off topic. We've gone for a
[01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:50.900]  long time. Let's wrap up this show. Hey Mike, thanks for coming over, dude. Happy to. You look
[01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:55.700]  like you're beat by now. I am. I'm ready to go home, grub something, take another dab and pass
[01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:58.900]  out. All right. Well then I'm going to let you do that. You guys, I want to thank you for listening

[01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:12.180]  going to party. I'm going to try to get a bunch of people on the show. I might take a bunch of big,
[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:17.380]  fat, ridiculous dabs. Big old round table, a bunch of coughing. Yeah. That's pretty much it. A square
[01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:22.260]  table with a bunch of coughing. I like it. I like it. All right, you guys. I would appreciate it if

[01:04:55.780 --> 01:05:00.740]  better over the rest of the year. As time goes, I'm just taking my iPhone and using the iPhone.

[01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:42.790]  With the glory of a champ, it's like a glove.
[01:08:55.270 --> 01:08:59.590]  Sham rules the world, Israel is his wife. I love you, yes, my God, with all my heart,
[01:08:59.590 --> 01:09:03.350]  my soul, and my might. And when I feel you by my side, yes, I'm flying like a kite.
[01:09:03.350 --> 01:09:05.990]  When I feel you by my side, yes, I'm soaring like a kite.
[01:09:06.150 --> 01:09:11.830]  It's not two, it's just one. The middle road called truth, Torah. Yes, it's who my brain
[01:09:11.830 --> 01:09:16.790]  brews. Open up the grooves with knowledge of God and move up. In the rousing from below,
[01:09:16.790 --> 01:09:21.350]  till the secrets start to ooze. Don't snooze, it's pure light. The most high wants us alive.
[01:09:21.350 --> 01:09:26.070]  What's the proof? We got life. Oh my God, oh my God, yeah.
[01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:30.950]  A bad philosophy, that's the deepest wellspring. Gaining knowledge of God while you're gaining
[01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:35.750]  money. Fill up yourself with the light of his majesty. In our world of separation,
[01:09:35.750 --> 01:09:40.230]  that's the only way to be. It's time we leave, we won't flee. Just walk out easily.
[01:09:40.230 --> 01:09:45.750]  It's time we leave, we won't flee. Just walk out easily. If you got no water, how you gonna survive?
[01:09:45.750 --> 01:09:51.430]  Roots lead you to the wellspring so you can stay alive. If you got no water, how you gonna survive?
[01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:57.030]  If you got no water, how you gonna survive? I see the world in a bridge from below to above.
[01:09:57.030 --> 01:10:01.990]  Take flight in the sky, got wings like a dove. We're soaring through Shemayim where the angels
[01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:05.510]  call it love. Where the glory of Hashem fits like a glove.
[01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:32.390]  Why you searching strange places, times unravel like Twan. Travel and you'll lose the battle and
[01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:36.550]  get left behind. A loading path where truth illuminates from inside.
[01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:43.750]  Why you searching strange places, times unravel like Twan. Travel and you'll lose the battle and
