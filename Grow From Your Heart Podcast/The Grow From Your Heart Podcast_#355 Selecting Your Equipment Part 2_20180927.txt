[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  Welcome to the show everybody! It's time for episode 355 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:05.000 --> 00:07.000]  Thank you for joining me.
[00:07.000 --> 00:11.000]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:11.000 --> 00:16.000]  If you need new genetics for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company
[00:16.000 --> 00:20.000]  and you can find them at dankseed.store.
[00:20.000 --> 00:27.000]  You guys, somebody has been smoking all of my concentrates, but I'm pretty sure it was me.
[00:27.000 --> 00:30.000]  I've been going pretty quickly through this Blueberry Citron Fambrosia.
[00:30.000 --> 00:38.000]  This stuff is delicious. I've described it as oranges coated in sugar with a hint of the purple Laffy Taffy,
[00:38.000 --> 00:43.000]  maybe a hint of blueberry in there. It is blueberry and clementine, so that would make total sense.
[00:43.000 --> 00:49.000]  It gives me a really nice head buzz. It keeps me nice and energized and it certainly makes me nice and talkative,
[00:49.000 --> 00:54.000]  so it's great podcast dabs. The only bad part is it tastes really good, so I always want to dab more of it,
[00:55.000 --> 01:00.000]  so it's almost gone. The good part about that is I'll open a fresh concentrate on the next episode
[01:00.000 --> 01:03.000]  and we will get to talk about a brand new flavor.
[01:03.000 --> 01:07.000]  All right, in this episode, we're going to get back on track with the grow lessons.
[01:07.000 --> 01:13.000]  This will be the fourth episode in a long series of grow lessons that will take us from the beginning of a grow
[01:13.000 --> 01:19.000]  all the way to the end. We've already done planning your grow. We've worked on selecting your grow space.
[01:19.000 --> 01:23.000]  We also talked a lot about planning your equipment. We talked a lot about planning your lighting,
[01:23.000 --> 01:29.000]  your air conditioning and how to handle airflow. Now in this episode, we're going to talk a little bit about
[01:29.000 --> 01:33.000]  how to control all of that stuff and what to plug all of those things into.
[01:33.000 --> 01:37.000]  So let's jump right into selecting your equipment part two.
[01:37.000 --> 01:42.000]  The first thing we'll probably need to think about is what are we going to plug the light into?
[01:42.000 --> 01:46.000]  Sure, you can plug it directly into the wall. Now it's going to be on 24 hours a day.
[01:47.000 --> 01:52.000]  Don't rely on yourself or your high roommate or maybe your girlfriend.
[01:52.000 --> 01:58.000]  Don't rely on anybody but technology to turn that light off and on at the same time every day.
[01:58.000 --> 02:03.000]  We need consistent light control. So let's talk about a controller for that light.
[02:03.000 --> 02:11.000]  The easiest route to go is just a basic on off timer that you can program to be on from a certain time and off at another time.
[02:11.000 --> 02:17.000]  I recommend digital timers. I like a timer with a battery backup. Think about this.
[02:17.000 --> 02:22.000]  You've got an analog timer. An analog timer, you plug it in and you spin it to the correct time
[02:22.000 --> 02:28.000]  and then you push pins down for when you want the light to come on and then you leave pins up for when you want the light to go off.
[02:28.000 --> 02:32.000]  Now you set it to the correct time and while it's plugged in, that dial spins.
[02:32.000 --> 02:37.000]  And then when the time comes, it clicks the lights to the appropriate on or off and then it keeps spinning.
[02:38.000 --> 02:42.000]  If you have a power interruption, that timer stops spinning.
[02:42.000 --> 02:46.000]  So whatever time the power goes out, that timer thinks it's that time.
[02:46.000 --> 02:50.000]  If it goes out at three o'clock, it's always three o'clock until the electricity comes back.
[02:50.000 --> 02:55.000]  Then it starts back up at three o'clock. The lights will come on and they'll run until they're programmed off cycle.
[02:55.000 --> 03:05.000]  If you have a digital timer with a battery backup, if you have a power failure, the power goes out at three, your clock and your timer keeps ticking.
[03:05.000 --> 03:10.000]  So when the lights come back on, your grow room is still on the regular schedule and your lights.
[03:10.000 --> 03:15.000]  Yes, you did get that dark period from the light interruption, but you are now back on your regular grow cycle.
[03:15.000 --> 03:17.000]  So you're not going to throw your whole grow system off.
[03:17.000 --> 03:24.000]  So I recommend if you're going to buy a basic plug in timer, I recommend a digital timer with the battery backup.
[03:24.000 --> 03:31.000]  Also make sure you get a timer that is rated to support enough amperage or voltage for your grow light.
[03:31.000 --> 03:35.000]  So for one light, a small plug in timer, it goes straight into the wall.
[03:35.000 --> 03:41.000]  You set the time on that timer, you set your off and on scheduled times and the light will go off and on when you expect it to.
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.000]  For one light, that's a really easy basic setup.
[03:44.000 --> 03:53.000]  You can plug 1000 watt into that with no problem in most homes or they do make another timer that has two outlets on it.
[03:53.000 --> 04:00.000]  With that timer, you can plug in probably two 600s, definitely two 400s, maybe a four and a six.
[04:00.000 --> 04:07.000]  But I would not recommend attempting to plug in 2000 watts unless you've done some electrical upgrades in that home.
[04:07.000 --> 04:08.000]  That will flip the breaker.
[04:08.000 --> 04:14.000]  If you try to plug in 2000 watt lights into one outlet without any upgrades, you're going to flip the breaker.
[04:14.000 --> 04:19.000]  I know I've said that a couple of times in these episodes, but I want you to keep that in mind when you're thinking about building your grow.
[04:19.000 --> 04:22.000]  A lot of people say, no, my house will probably be able to do it.
[04:22.000 --> 04:23.000]  No, it won't.
[04:23.000 --> 04:24.000]  Your house isn't special.
[04:24.000 --> 04:26.000]  You don't have magic breakers.
[04:26.000 --> 04:27.000]  You didn't buy magic ballasts.
[04:27.000 --> 04:33.000]  You're probably going to flip breakers if you put too much electricity through them and you also start running a risk of fire.
[04:33.000 --> 04:34.000]  Everything starts getting weaker.
[04:34.000 --> 04:41.000]  The more time you flip that breaker, the weaker it's getting, which also means you're heating up the receptacles, which also means you're heating up the wires.
[04:41.000 --> 04:43.000]  You're stressing everything over time.
[04:43.000 --> 04:44.000]  That equals fire.
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.000]  So just quit pressing your luck.
[04:46.000 --> 04:52.000]  Reduce your amount of lights, settle for having less lighting or pay for the electrical upgrades that are required.
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  And here's another idea that people get.
[04:54.000 --> 05:00.000]  They plug in the timer, then they plug in the power strip, and then they plug in their light and other accessories into that power strip.
[05:00.000 --> 05:09.000]  Make sure if you're going to do that, that that power strip is strong enough and rated to support the voltage and amperage for all of the electronics you're plugging into there.
[05:09.000 --> 05:12.000]  Also, you can't plug in another light just by doing that.
[05:12.000 --> 05:13.000]  You're going to blow up that timer.
[05:13.000 --> 05:16.000]  It's going to short out or you're going to short out the receptacles.
[05:16.000 --> 05:18.000]  I've already talked about the things that are going to happen.
[05:19.000 --> 05:27.000]  You can plug in an extension cord or a power strip into your timer and provide multiple plug-in spots so that they all come on at the same time.
[05:27.000 --> 05:30.000]  But do not overload that power strip.
[05:30.000 --> 05:33.000]  Maybe have the light and a fan come on at the same time with the power strip.
[05:33.000 --> 05:34.000]  That's not a bad idea.
[05:34.000 --> 05:36.000]  Maybe a light and two small fans would work for you.
[05:36.000 --> 05:38.000]  Maybe a light, a blower, and a fan.
[05:38.000 --> 05:41.000]  But don't think you can outsmart electricity.
[05:41.000 --> 05:46.000]  Don't think you got smart by plugging in a power strip and then you were able to overload that timer.
[05:46.000 --> 05:49.000]  That timer will just crap out on you and then it'll be dark or it'll catch on fire.
[05:49.000 --> 05:50.000]  It may just melt.
[05:50.000 --> 05:52.000]  All right, so let me get back on track.
[05:52.000 --> 05:57.000]  For one light, a timer plugged directly into the wall, then the light plugged into that.
[05:57.000 --> 05:58.000]  That is perfect for one light.
[05:58.000 --> 06:03.000]  You can also possibly run two lights if you're running four 600-watt lights with a dual timer.
[06:03.000 --> 06:04.000]  They do make that.
[06:04.000 --> 06:06.000]  It is available at your growth store.
[06:06.000 --> 06:08.000]  It may be available at your local hardware store.
[06:08.000 --> 06:09.000]  I'm not sure what's available to you.
[06:09.000 --> 06:11.000]  It is certainly available on Amazon.
[06:11.000 --> 06:15.000]  Of course, we always recommend you shop locally at a mom-and-pop shop.
[06:15.000 --> 06:17.000]  Avoid those big-box stores.
[06:17.000 --> 06:20.000]  Recently, I've said things like Lowe's and Walmart.
[06:20.000 --> 06:22.000]  I say that because I know you guys have those.
[06:22.000 --> 06:25.000]  But if you have a smaller local shop, go there.
[06:25.000 --> 06:26.000]  That does help out.
[06:26.000 --> 06:29.000]  All right, now we know how to control one or two lights.
[06:29.000 --> 06:31.000]  We just use a basic horticultural timer.
[06:31.000 --> 06:32.000]  Plug it into the wall.
[06:32.000 --> 06:33.000]  Plug your light into there.
[06:33.000 --> 06:34.000]  That's real easy.
[06:34.000 --> 06:38.000]  Now, what if we want to run three, maybe four, maybe six or eight lights?
[06:38.000 --> 06:39.000]  What do we do then?
[06:39.000 --> 06:41.000]  The first step to that is electrical upgrades.
[06:41.000 --> 06:44.000]  I'm going to talk about that a lot when we talk about these lessons
[06:44.000 --> 06:47.000]  because I don't want you to put yourself or your house in danger.
[06:47.000 --> 06:48.000]  So, electrical upgrades.
[06:48.000 --> 06:52.000]  If you're going to do four lights in a room, you will need electrical upgrades.
[06:52.000 --> 06:54.000]  Now, when you're doing the electrical upgrades,
[06:54.000 --> 06:57.000]  it's the time to start thinking about your lighting controllers.
[06:57.000 --> 07:01.000]  Some of them have a plug that looks like the plug that plugs into the dryer.
[07:01.000 --> 07:06.000]  Some of them are sold with just bare wires at the end that you have to hardwire in.
[07:06.000 --> 07:10.000]  Keep that in mind when you're designing your space and selecting your controller.
[07:10.000 --> 07:13.000]  Do you want to hardwire your controller in?
[07:13.000 --> 07:15.000]  Is this going to be a permanent fixture?
[07:15.000 --> 07:18.000]  Or do you want something you can plug into a dryer type plug-in
[07:18.000 --> 07:22.000]  and then maybe you can upgrade or downgrade or replace that unit in the future?
[07:22.000 --> 07:24.000]  Think about this now while you're planning your grow.
[07:24.000 --> 07:26.000]  So, let's talk about lighting controllers while we're here.
[07:26.000 --> 07:29.000]  What do I mean by a lighting controller?
[07:29.000 --> 07:33.000]  A lighting controller is basically a large timer that, like I said,
[07:33.000 --> 07:36.000]  it either plugs into the dryer plug or it's hardwired right in
[07:36.000 --> 07:41.000]  and it's got multiple plug-ins on it to where you can plug in four, six, eight.
[07:41.000 --> 07:44.000]  I've seen 12 lights on one of these devices.
[07:44.000 --> 07:47.000]  I've seen 24 lights on a flip box on lighting controllers.
[07:47.000 --> 07:51.000]  A Govita Master Controller will run 48 lights at one time, I believe.
[07:51.000 --> 07:55.000]  Let's focus more on something you may find in a home grow now.
[07:55.000 --> 07:58.000]  For a lighting controller and a small home grow,
[07:58.000 --> 08:03.000]  you may find a box with a timer in it, with a bunch of plug-ins in it,
[08:03.000 --> 08:08.000]  with a cord that comes out, like I said, that plugs into the 240 or it's hardwired in.
[08:08.000 --> 08:12.000]  Now, that one timer will function all of the plug-ins on that box.
[08:12.000 --> 08:16.000]  There may also be a switch that will allow a couple of those plug-ins
[08:16.000 --> 08:19.000]  to operate independently so they can stay on all the time
[08:19.000 --> 08:22.000]  or you can flip a switch and they work with the timer.
[08:22.000 --> 08:24.000]  Some of the boxes have that, some of them don't.
[08:24.000 --> 08:27.000]  The power box is what I'm speaking of specifically.
[08:27.000 --> 08:31.000]  Basically, instead of plugging a bunch of timers in and trying to sync them up
[08:31.000 --> 08:34.000]  and plugging all your lights into four individual timers,
[08:34.000 --> 08:37.000]  you put up a light controller, you set the timer on that,
[08:37.000 --> 08:40.000]  you set the light schedule you want on that, you either hardwire that in
[08:40.000 --> 08:42.000]  or you plug it into the dryer fixture.
[08:42.000 --> 08:46.000]  Then you plug your grow lights into that controller.
[08:46.000 --> 08:49.000]  Then when the schedule lighting cycle comes on, all four lights come on at once.
[08:49.000 --> 08:52.000]  When it goes off, all four lights go off at once.
[08:52.000 --> 08:53.000]  You don't have to deal with a bunch of timers.
[08:53.000 --> 08:55.000]  You don't have to try to sync up four different timers.
[08:55.000 --> 08:58.000]  You don't have to try to fit four timers in one spot and plug lights into them.
[08:58.000 --> 09:02.000]  It's all easy to program with one unit with one timer.
[09:02.000 --> 09:06.000]  There are a lot of different brands of lighting controllers available.
[09:06.000 --> 09:11.000]  Earlier, I recommended a digital timer with a battery backup.
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.000]  I would also recommend something similar with your controller.
[09:15.000 --> 09:19.000]  They do offer a light controller that has a timer with a battery in it.
[09:19.000 --> 09:23.000]  So if the power does go out, that timer stays on the same cycle.
[09:23.000 --> 09:25.000]  That is always advantageous.
[09:25.000 --> 09:29.000]  So whether it's digital or it's analog on your lighting controller,
[09:29.000 --> 09:31.000]  try to look for one with a battery backup.
[09:31.000 --> 09:35.000]  So if you do have a power failure, it doesn't throw everything off schedule.
[09:35.000 --> 09:40.000]  For a home grow or maybe a small garage grow or something like a shed grow,
[09:40.000 --> 09:45.000]  I would probably recommend a power box or a Titan lighting controller.
[09:45.000 --> 09:47.000]  I know I don't recommend a lot of brands.
[09:47.000 --> 09:48.000]  I try to stay away from brands,
[09:48.000 --> 09:52.000]  but those are going to be the two that are most affordable for somebody
[09:52.000 --> 09:55.000]  trying to get into a medium-sized grow.
[09:55.000 --> 09:58.000]  I often talk about a four-light room that I work in.
[09:58.000 --> 10:03.000]  In that room, it is controlled by a Powerbox DPC-7500.
[10:03.000 --> 10:08.000]  It's got the dryer plug that plugs into a dedicated dryer-type plug in that room.
[10:08.000 --> 10:13.000]  Then the unit has spots for four plugins that are synced up with the timer.
[10:13.000 --> 10:17.000]  Then there are two plugins that you have the option of pressing a switch,
[10:17.000 --> 10:20.000]  and those plugins either work with the timer or they are on continuous,
[10:20.000 --> 10:22.000]  which means they never turn off.
[10:22.000 --> 10:26.000]  So in those four main plugins that work with the timer, I plug in four lights.
[10:26.000 --> 10:30.000]  In those other two plugins, I've got a fan and my main extraction blower running.
[10:30.000 --> 10:34.000]  So it's all operating off of that one unit.
[10:34.000 --> 10:37.000]  There are a lot of options when it comes to lighting controllers,
[10:37.000 --> 10:41.000]  so start thinking about that as we design our grow room.
[10:41.000 --> 10:43.000]  We've got to plug our lights into something,
[10:43.000 --> 10:45.000]  and we've also got to keep our lights on a schedule,
[10:46.000 --> 10:50.000]  so a lighting controller will be a huge decision in designing your grow.
[10:50.000 --> 10:53.000]  Now let's talk a little bit about your air conditioner.
[10:53.000 --> 10:56.000]  How are you going to control your air conditioner?
[10:56.000 --> 10:58.000]  Are you going to plug it directly into the wall?
[10:58.000 --> 11:02.000]  Are you going to plug it into one of those accessory switches on the Powerbox
[11:02.000 --> 11:03.000]  that it's constantly on?
[11:03.000 --> 11:08.000]  And then at that point, are you going to use the thermostat on the air conditioner
[11:08.000 --> 11:12.000]  and rely on that, or are we going to plug the air conditioner
[11:12.000 --> 11:16.000]  into another trigger device that has a sensor that hangs in the middle of the room
[11:16.000 --> 11:19.000]  and pays attention to the temperature there?
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  Those are a few things to think about.
[11:21.000 --> 11:24.000]  So when you are buying your air conditioner,
[11:24.000 --> 11:27.000]  if you plan on plugging it into another triggering device,
[11:27.000 --> 11:32.000]  make sure you buy an analog air conditioner with analog controllers,
[11:32.000 --> 11:35.000]  like a knob that clicks, like a high, medium, low.
[11:35.000 --> 11:38.000]  Some of your digital air conditioners won't work
[11:38.000 --> 11:41.000]  if you try to trigger them with another device.
[11:41.000 --> 11:43.000]  So here's how it will work.
[11:43.000 --> 11:45.000]  You will have a switch that plugs into the wall.
[11:45.000 --> 11:48.000]  That switch will have a setting that says,
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.000]  I want this device to come on when the temperature gets this high.
[11:52.000 --> 11:56.000]  I want this device to go off when the temperature gets this low.
[11:56.000 --> 11:58.000]  So it's just a little range that you set.
[11:58.000 --> 12:02.000]  Then that thing has a cord that hangs in the center of the room with a thermometer.
[12:02.000 --> 12:05.000]  So now we're getting the temperature from the center of the room
[12:05.000 --> 12:08.000]  instead of where that air conditioner is located.
[12:08.000 --> 12:11.000]  Now we can actually take a reading from the plant area
[12:11.000 --> 12:14.000]  instead of that one wall where the air conditioner is sitting.
[12:14.000 --> 12:16.000]  So now the air conditioner is plugged into this cap switch.
[12:16.000 --> 12:18.000]  This switch is reading from the middle of the room.
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  Now what's going to happen, it's going to say,
[12:20.000 --> 12:23.000]  oh, it's reached the temperature we want. Let's turn it off.
[12:23.000 --> 12:25.000]  It doesn't reach up and hit the off switch on the air conditioner.
[12:25.000 --> 12:27.000]  It simply cuts off the power.
[12:27.000 --> 12:31.000]  So now there's no power. Everything has reset on your digital device.
[12:31.000 --> 12:34.000]  When it comes back on, is that digital air conditioner
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  going to come back on in the previous setting,
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  or is it just going to come back on and blink
[12:38.000 --> 12:40.000]  and wait for human interaction to tell it what to do?
[12:40.000 --> 12:43.000]  That's the downfall of digital devices.
[12:43.000 --> 12:46.000]  If you only plan to trigger your air conditioner
[12:46.000 --> 12:49.000]  with the air conditioner's onboard controls,
[12:49.000 --> 12:51.000]  you can get a digital air conditioner.
[12:51.000 --> 12:55.000]  If you plan to run your air conditioner through another triggering device,
[12:55.000 --> 12:58.000]  I recommend an analog air conditioner.
[12:58.000 --> 13:04.000]  I will make the same recommendation when it comes to humidifiers and dehumidifiers.
[13:04.000 --> 13:08.000]  If you want to plug them into the wall and let them work off their own functions,
[13:08.000 --> 13:11.000]  off their own settings, you can do that.
[13:11.000 --> 13:14.000]  And that will be just fine for a tent or a small room.
[13:14.000 --> 13:17.000]  If you really want to dial it in, I recommend
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.000]  something that can take a humidity measurement from the middle of the room.
[13:21.000 --> 13:24.000]  Like I talked about earlier with the air conditioner,
[13:24.000 --> 13:27.000]  you would have a cap switch that plugs into the wall.
[13:27.000 --> 13:30.000]  This would have a humidistat controller on it.
[13:30.000 --> 13:32.000]  It would say when the humidity gets to this point,
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  activate this, power this device.
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  It doesn't even know what's plugged into there,
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  it just knows that it needs to power that switch.
[13:38.000 --> 13:41.000]  When the humidity gets below here, turn that switch off.
[13:41.000 --> 13:45.000]  That cap switch then has a humidistat on a cord
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.000]  that we can hang in the center of the room.
[13:47.000 --> 13:51.000]  That way we can get our humidity measurement from a more appropriate place
[13:51.000 --> 13:53.000]  instead of down on the corner on the floor
[13:53.000 --> 13:56.000]  where the humidifier or dehumidifier is located.
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  So we've got a cap switch, it's plugged into the wall,
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  it's got settings on it,
[14:00.000 --> 14:05.000]  it's got a corded humidity reader on it that hangs in the center of the room.
[14:05.000 --> 14:09.000]  Then we plug our humidifier or dehumidifier into that cap switch
[14:09.000 --> 14:13.000]  and it is activated by the readings from the center of the room.
[14:13.000 --> 14:16.000]  These extra controllers are not necessary,
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  but if you really want to dial in your room
[14:18.000 --> 14:22.000]  to a precise humidity range and a temperature range
[14:22.000 --> 14:26.000]  and get that vapor pressure deficit dialed in for your plants,
[14:26.000 --> 14:29.000]  these types of devices are what you're going to need.
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  You can make cap switches to trigger everything.
[14:31.000 --> 14:33.000]  You can trigger your fans, your blowers.
[14:33.000 --> 14:37.000]  You can set up cap switches to trigger any type of grow room equipment
[14:37.000 --> 14:40.000]  if your equipment is compatible.
[14:40.000 --> 14:44.000]  You need the type of air conditioner, dehumidifier, and or humidifier
[14:44.000 --> 14:47.000]  that has a knob where you can set to high
[14:47.000 --> 14:50.000]  and then you can plug those into other devices that will control them.
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.000]  That way when they're necessary,
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.000]  they just come on at their highest and they activate.
[14:55.000 --> 14:58.000]  And then when you reach the parameters you need, they turn off.
[14:58.000 --> 15:02.000]  For that to work, we need devices that can handle power interruptions
[15:02.000 --> 15:06.000]  that won't reset their settings when they come back on.
[15:06.000 --> 15:10.000]  Now that's the basic equipment to set up an analog grow room.
[15:10.000 --> 15:13.000]  Now let's talk about automating things a little more
[15:13.000 --> 15:16.000]  and also giving ourselves the ability to make adjustments
[15:16.000 --> 15:22.000]  from a remote location and also turn off and on equipment from remote locations.
[15:22.000 --> 15:26.000]  We'll be able to monitor our grow and make changes on the fly
[15:26.000 --> 15:30.000]  with some of the advanced technology that is available for our grow rooms.
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  Let's talk a little bit about that stuff.
[15:32.000 --> 15:38.000]  There are several options for setting up a more automated grow room through technology.
[15:38.000 --> 15:43.000]  I'm trying to avoid pitching specific brands and specific products here.
[15:43.000 --> 15:48.000]  But for this example, I'm going to use a specific piece of equipment
[15:48.000 --> 15:51.000]  and a specific brand of equipment to paint a picture
[15:51.000 --> 15:54.000]  of how we can set up an automated grow room.
[15:54.000 --> 15:57.000]  I have a lot of experience with this device and with this equipment,
[15:57.000 --> 16:00.000]  so it makes it easy for me to draw the plan in my head,
[16:00.000 --> 16:04.000]  which makes it easier for me to kind of convey the idea to you.
[16:04.000 --> 16:09.000]  This is an example of how I set up the automation at a recent facility I worked with.
[16:09.000 --> 16:12.000]  And I'm going to try to stay away from mentioning brand names
[16:12.000 --> 16:16.000]  and proprietary specific names of their devices.
[16:16.000 --> 16:18.000]  But this is how we do it.
[16:18.000 --> 16:21.000]  This brand comes with, their product comes with a brain.
[16:21.000 --> 16:25.000]  And this brain syncs up through Wi-Fi to your cell phone.
[16:25.000 --> 16:30.000]  You set up an account, you create a password, then you design your grow rooms.
[16:30.000 --> 16:33.000]  If you've got a bedroom, just go make bedroom.
[16:33.000 --> 16:36.000]  If you've got two bedrooms, make two bedrooms, give them a name.
[16:36.000 --> 16:40.000]  Then you enter your flower rooms, flower A, flower B, flower C,
[16:40.000 --> 16:41.000]  however you want to do it.
[16:41.000 --> 16:44.000]  You just type them in and you create the rooms.
[16:44.000 --> 16:47.000]  Then you select a room on the application.
[16:47.000 --> 16:50.000]  If you're doing a small home grow, it's probably just the flower room,
[16:50.000 --> 16:51.000]  the one room that you've got.
[16:51.000 --> 16:54.000]  Now that's where the next fun piece of equipment comes in.
[16:54.000 --> 16:57.000]  The next piece of equipment looks like a basic power strip.
[16:57.000 --> 17:03.000]  It's got a plug that plugs into the wall, and then it has four available plug-in spots.
[17:03.000 --> 17:08.000]  It plugs into the wall, and now it connects wirelessly to that brain unit
[17:08.000 --> 17:10.000]  that is connected to your phone.
[17:10.000 --> 17:16.000]  Now that power strip has four slots in it that are numbered one, two, three, and four.
[17:17.000 --> 17:19.000]  Now you open up the application on your phone,
[17:19.000 --> 17:22.000]  and it will show you that you have plugged in that power strip.
[17:22.000 --> 17:23.000]  It knows it's there.
[17:23.000 --> 17:24.000]  The app has found it.
[17:24.000 --> 17:26.000]  The brain says, hey, this is here.
[17:26.000 --> 17:27.000]  What do you want me to do with it?
[17:27.000 --> 17:28.000]  You add it.
[17:28.000 --> 17:29.000]  You say, that is in room one.
[17:29.000 --> 17:31.000]  You assign it to a room number.
[17:31.000 --> 17:34.000]  Now you've already got a room started with a piece of equipment in there.
[17:34.000 --> 17:36.000]  Now it's got four slots on it.
[17:36.000 --> 17:40.000]  You can assign each of those four slots to be a different piece of equipment.
[17:40.000 --> 17:43.000]  So I would say slot one is my lights.
[17:43.000 --> 17:45.000]  And now you just, it's really easy to scroll through.
[17:45.000 --> 17:46.000]  There's a little dial.
[17:46.000 --> 17:48.000]  It says, what is plugged into slot one?
[17:48.000 --> 17:49.000]  Is it HVAC?
[17:49.000 --> 17:50.000]  Is it a light?
[17:50.000 --> 17:51.000]  Is it irrigation?
[17:51.000 --> 17:52.000]  It's real easy.
[17:52.000 --> 17:53.000]  It's a light.
[17:53.000 --> 17:54.000]  Cool, no problem.
[17:54.000 --> 17:55.000]  You just hold it.
[17:55.000 --> 17:56.000]  Slot number one is a light.
[17:56.000 --> 17:58.000]  Slot number two is an air conditioner.
[17:58.000 --> 17:59.000]  Slot number three is a blower.
[17:59.000 --> 18:02.000]  And slot number four is a dehumidifier.
[18:02.000 --> 18:04.000]  We're just being hypothetical here.
[18:04.000 --> 18:08.000]  So once you've got all of the devices assigned to that power strip,
[18:08.000 --> 18:11.000]  you go to the room and set settings for the room.
[18:11.000 --> 18:14.000]  So our light is plugged into spot number one.
[18:14.000 --> 18:17.000]  You just go to lighting and you set a lighting schedule and you hit save.
[18:17.000 --> 18:22.000]  And now slot one will act accordingly to the schedule you have just set.
[18:22.000 --> 18:24.000]  So the air conditioner is slot two.
[18:24.000 --> 18:25.000]  You just go to HVAC.
[18:25.000 --> 18:28.000]  Then you tell it, I want it to stay this temperature in here.
[18:28.000 --> 18:32.000]  So if it gets too hot, it'll fire up slot number two on that power strip.
[18:32.000 --> 18:36.000]  And each spot on that power strip will act as programmed.
[18:36.000 --> 18:39.000]  Now you're going to say, how does it know what to do?
[18:39.000 --> 18:43.000]  Because there's another device in the box that hangs in the very center of the room.
[18:43.000 --> 18:51.000]  And this device has a light temperature and humidity sensor that takes a reading every 15 seconds.
[18:51.000 --> 18:57.000]  So every 15 seconds, it takes a fresh reading and it sends the information back to the brain unit.
[18:57.000 --> 19:02.000]  And the brain says, okay, so it's 9 a.m., which means the lights need to be on.
[19:02.000 --> 19:04.000]  So I'll keep that switch on.
[19:04.000 --> 19:06.000]  It's gotten up to 84 degrees in here.
[19:06.000 --> 19:09.000]  So I need to turn on the air conditioner and let's check on the humidity.
[19:09.000 --> 19:10.000]  Humidity is cool.
[19:10.000 --> 19:11.000]  So we don't need to turn on that device.
[19:11.000 --> 19:13.000]  And the fan, that goes with the air conditioner.
[19:13.000 --> 19:15.000]  So that came on too probably.
[19:15.000 --> 19:19.000]  So now your lights are on, the air conditioner is on, the fan's blowing around.
[19:19.000 --> 19:21.000]  That dehumidifier doesn't need to be on.
[19:21.000 --> 19:22.000]  So it's just chilling.
[19:22.000 --> 19:25.000]  And every 15 seconds, that unit's going to keep taking measurements.
[19:25.000 --> 19:29.000]  And then once it sees that we've gotten down to the parameters we've programmed in,
[19:29.000 --> 19:31.000]  then it will turn off that air conditioner.
[19:31.000 --> 19:32.000]  That fan will turn off.
[19:32.000 --> 19:34.000]  The lights will stay on.
[19:34.000 --> 19:37.000]  And that dehumidifier will be right there on standby for when we need it.
[19:37.000 --> 19:43.000]  The unit I'm talking about also has the ability to measure the moisture content in your medium.
[19:43.000 --> 19:47.000]  If you're running Rockwell Cubes, if you're running Coco, if you're running Soil,
[19:47.000 --> 19:49.000]  whatever type of medium you're working in,
[19:49.000 --> 19:55.000]  this device has the ability to measure the moisture content in your medium.
[19:55.000 --> 20:00.000]  That means you can set up automated irrigation when the plants reach a certain dryness.
[20:00.000 --> 20:02.000]  How does that work?
[20:02.000 --> 20:03.000]  It's fairly easy.
[20:03.000 --> 20:06.000]  You put these little sticks in your medium and you calibrate them.
[20:06.000 --> 20:10.000]  They link up to the water content sensor controller,
[20:10.000 --> 20:15.000]  which wirelessly hooks up to the brain, which wirelessly relays to your phone.
[20:15.000 --> 20:21.000]  So that moisture content meter is constantly, every 15 seconds, taking a moisture meter in your medium.
[20:21.000 --> 20:26.000]  It's sending that reading up to the little brain, which is sending it back to the main brain,
[20:26.000 --> 20:27.000]  which is sending it to your phone.
[20:27.000 --> 20:30.000]  Now, if you have the equipment installed, you can go to that room,
[20:30.000 --> 20:33.000]  you can open the irrigation tab on your phone,
[20:33.000 --> 20:37.000]  and you can tell it to water that room when it gets to a certain dryness.
[20:37.000 --> 20:43.000]  And you can tell it to water for a certain amount of time or until it reaches a certain moisture level.
[20:43.000 --> 20:49.000]  Basically, the way you would do that, you would plug your irrigation pump into that power strip I spoke of earlier,
[20:49.000 --> 20:54.000]  or you can add another one of their specified power strips that syncs up wirelessly to the brain,
[20:54.000 --> 20:56.000]  which then syncs wirelessly to your phone.
[20:56.000 --> 20:58.000]  So you plug your irrigation pump into that.
[20:59.000 --> 21:04.000]  You go to the irrigation tab in the application, and you tell it when to water.
[21:04.000 --> 21:08.000]  And then when the plants get dry, it simply sends electricity to plug number four,
[21:08.000 --> 21:10.000]  or whichever plug you assigned as irrigation.
[21:10.000 --> 21:13.000]  It'll activate that. It will start watering.
[21:13.000 --> 21:18.000]  Once it gets wet enough, it will know, because it's got a moisture content sensor in your medium,
[21:18.000 --> 21:21.000]  and it will say wet enough, and it'll send a signal to the brain,
[21:21.000 --> 21:25.000]  and it will discontinue powering your irrigation pump.
[21:25.000 --> 21:28.000]  Now, there are a lot of ways to irrigate your system.
[21:28.000 --> 21:30.000]  Maybe you're running a flood and drain system.
[21:30.000 --> 21:33.000]  Maybe that will just tell it when to flood and drain.
[21:33.000 --> 21:37.000]  Maybe you're running pots with an automated drip system like we talked about in another episode.
[21:37.000 --> 21:42.000]  However you do it, basically, you are just triggering the pump to come on.
[21:42.000 --> 21:47.000]  And it knows when to come on because we've got those moisture content sensors
[21:47.000 --> 21:50.000]  pressed into our medium at specified intervals.
[21:50.000 --> 21:54.000]  And the unit I'm talking about allows you to have six different water probes
[21:54.000 --> 21:57.000]  in different locations hooked up to one unit.
[21:57.000 --> 22:00.000]  So there are six wired probes that go back to one unit.
[22:00.000 --> 22:04.000]  That one unit then wirelessly sends the data back to the brain.
[22:04.000 --> 22:06.000]  That brain relays it to your phone.
[22:06.000 --> 22:09.000]  So once we've dialed in automated lighting, automated air conditioning,
[22:09.000 --> 22:15.000]  automated dehumidification and humidification, and now we've got automated irrigation,
[22:15.000 --> 22:21.000]  we have almost got a fully automated grow room with very basic equipment.
[22:21.000 --> 22:25.000]  And honestly, not a huge budget if you shop smart.
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.000]  I know it's exciting to get everything automated.
[22:27.000 --> 22:29.000]  You want it all dialed in. You want it just to happen.
[22:29.000 --> 22:31.000]  It's fun watching the machine happen.
[22:31.000 --> 22:34.000]  I would just stand in the corner of the grow room and look at a timer and go,
[22:34.000 --> 22:37.000]  so in about 10 seconds, and you would know that that's going to switch off.
[22:37.000 --> 22:39.000]  That thing's going to go. That's going to happen.
[22:39.000 --> 22:41.000]  All the bells are going to happen. The whistles are going to happen.
[22:41.000 --> 22:44.000]  It's like a big game of mousetrap. It feels really great to watch.
[22:44.000 --> 22:50.000]  With all that being said, some of my favorite advice is keep it simple, stupid.
[22:50.000 --> 22:53.000]  I know I'm calling you stupid, but that's the way the saying goes.
[22:53.000 --> 22:56.000]  Keep it simple, stoner. How's that? Does that feel better?
[22:56.000 --> 22:59.000]  Keep it simple, stoner. We don't need to make everything elaborate.
[22:59.000 --> 23:02.000]  A small grow does not need a lot of equipment.
[23:02.000 --> 23:09.000]  The more electronics you have, the more knobs and dials and bells and whistles you've got,
[23:09.000 --> 23:11.000]  the more shit can go wrong.
[23:11.000 --> 23:17.000]  If you've got a light and a fan and an air conditioner and some way to pull stale air and heat out of that room,
[23:17.000 --> 23:21.000]  you have got all you need. Of course, it is fun to trick out the room.
[23:21.000 --> 23:24.000]  It's fun to have accessories. It's fun to have toys.
[23:24.000 --> 23:28.000]  It's also going to improve your quality if you dial it in properly.
[23:28.000 --> 23:31.000]  Don't spend money on a bunch of toys just to have them.
[23:31.000 --> 23:34.000]  Think about what you need. Think about what's necessity.
[23:34.000 --> 23:38.000]  Think about the order in which you need your new toys.
[23:39.000 --> 23:41.000]  I'm going to skip off of my notes here and I'm going to say,
[23:41.000 --> 23:44.000]  instead of spending a whole bunch of money on some automation,
[23:44.000 --> 23:47.000]  why not buy yourself a better pH pen?
[23:47.000 --> 23:52.000]  I was going to talk later about pH pens and EC meters, but now's a good time.
[23:52.000 --> 23:56.000]  Instead of spending a lot of money on automation, you need a quality pH pen.
[23:56.000 --> 23:59.000]  Your plants are going to look like shit without proper pH.
[23:59.000 --> 24:03.000]  If you're putting together a budget and you're trying to include auto watering
[24:03.000 --> 24:08.000]  and you're trying to decide between a quality pH pen or maybe some fancy auto watering stuff,
[24:08.000 --> 24:11.000]  I highly recommend you go with a good pH pen.
[24:11.000 --> 24:15.000]  You need that from the beginning. You can add auto watering later.
[24:15.000 --> 24:17.000]  You can buy fancier toys later.
[24:17.000 --> 24:20.000]  If you're on a tight budget, get the necessities first,
[24:20.000 --> 24:22.000]  and then we can expand in the future.
[24:22.000 --> 24:25.000]  If you don't have the right stuff, you're not going to have a quality product
[24:25.000 --> 24:28.000]  and it's all going to be a giant waste of money.
[24:28.000 --> 24:30.000]  All right, we've talked about controlling everything.
[24:30.000 --> 24:33.000]  Here's something that I want to include, but I'm not sure where it fits in,
[24:33.000 --> 24:36.000]  so I'm just going to tag it in right here.
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.000]  What about CO2 augmentation?
[24:38.000 --> 24:41.000]  Maybe you want to add CO2 to your grow room.
[24:41.000 --> 24:46.000]  This is probably going to require you making extra trips to either the grow store
[24:46.000 --> 24:48.000]  or the commercial gas place.
[24:48.000 --> 24:50.000]  Our local place here is called Airgas.
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  You're going to have to buy or rent a container.
[24:52.000 --> 24:56.000]  You're going to have to get that refilled as frequently as you need it.
[24:56.000 --> 24:59.000]  I don't know how often it's going to need to be refilled in your environment.
[24:59.000 --> 25:01.000]  I don't know how well-sealed your room is.
[25:01.000 --> 25:04.000]  I don't know how much CO2 your room starts with.
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.000]  I don't know how much CO2 you're trying to get it to.
[25:06.000 --> 25:09.000]  I don't know how often you'll need your containers filled.
[25:09.000 --> 25:14.000]  But for CO2 augmentation, you're going to need either those big tanks
[25:14.000 --> 25:19.000]  or a CO2 burner, which will have to be hardwired into your natural gas line.
[25:19.000 --> 25:22.000]  So tanks are probably the easiest way to go.
[25:22.000 --> 25:24.000]  You'll have to get the tanks, get them to the room.
[25:24.000 --> 25:27.000]  If you're not an able-bodied person, this could be challenging.
[25:27.000 --> 25:30.000]  The larger tanks are hard for me to move.
[25:30.000 --> 25:32.000]  The smaller tanks are not light either.
[25:32.000 --> 25:36.000]  So once you've got the tanks to the room, now you require a regulator.
[25:36.000 --> 25:38.000]  This screws onto the nozzle on the tank.
[25:38.000 --> 25:41.000]  It'll be obvious when you've got the tank and the regulator.
[25:41.000 --> 25:42.000]  You will see where that goes.
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.000]  You screw on the regulator.
[25:44.000 --> 25:45.000]  There are a couple of knobs.
[25:45.000 --> 25:49.000]  You've got to open the tank, turn the gas onto the tank.
[25:49.000 --> 25:51.000]  Now it's going to be flowing to the regulator.
[25:51.000 --> 25:54.000]  That regulator has a valve you can turn.
[25:54.000 --> 25:57.000]  It will allow gas to flow through the lines.
[25:57.000 --> 25:59.000]  There are lines that attach to the regulator.
[25:59.000 --> 26:02.000]  Hang those lines high in your grow.
[26:02.000 --> 26:05.000]  I like to hang them right about the height of the lights.
[26:05.000 --> 26:08.000]  CO2 is a gas that is heavier than oxygen.
[26:08.000 --> 26:12.000]  That CO2 is going to pump through those lines, and it will fall right down
[26:12.000 --> 26:15.000]  onto the plants and become available for the plants.
[26:15.000 --> 26:18.000]  Now, how do we know how much CO2 is in the room?
[26:18.000 --> 26:19.000]  That's when CO2 gets expensive.
[26:19.000 --> 26:22.000]  You need a CO2 monitor.
[26:22.000 --> 26:26.000]  You can get a standalone CO2 monitor, or this will work right into the
[26:26.000 --> 26:28.000]  automated system I was talking about earlier.
[26:28.000 --> 26:31.000]  There is a tab for CO2.
[26:31.000 --> 26:35.000]  So we need a CO2 monitor, whether a standalone unit or a unit that's
[26:35.000 --> 26:38.000]  combined with our other monitoring and triggering system.
[26:38.000 --> 26:43.000]  Now, your more expensive CO2 monitors will also have a CO2 controller.
[26:43.000 --> 26:47.000]  These CO2 controllers work very similarly to the cap controllers
[26:47.000 --> 26:49.000]  I talked about earlier.
[26:49.000 --> 26:52.000]  There are a lot of different brands and styles available.
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.000]  Most of them will have a screen.
[26:54.000 --> 26:59.000]  On that screen, you can set the level that you want the CO2 to reach in that room.
[26:59.000 --> 27:03.000]  Some of the more advanced models will also give you the option to set a
[27:03.000 --> 27:06.000]  schedule so that it comes on only when the lights are on, and it does not come
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  on when the lights are off.
[27:08.000 --> 27:10.000]  We don't need to add CO2 when the lights are off.
[27:10.000 --> 27:14.000]  So you'll be able to set the level you want the CO2 to reach, and you'll be
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  able to set a schedule.
[27:16.000 --> 27:20.000]  Now, this CO2 monitor has a cord hanging off of it, which plugs into the wall
[27:20.000 --> 27:22.000]  or your power source.
[27:22.000 --> 27:26.000]  Now, the plug that plugs into the wall has a piggyback that you can just plug
[27:26.000 --> 27:30.000]  your CO2 regulator directly into.
[27:30.000 --> 27:34.000]  So now that thing's going to monitor the level of CO2 in the room, and when it
[27:34.000 --> 27:39.000]  needs electricity triggered to the CO2 regulator, it will just fire up and let
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  the CO2 regulator know to come on.
[27:41.000 --> 27:44.000]  The CO2 regulator will pump gas down those lines that you've got hung above
[27:44.000 --> 27:48.000]  the canopy, and then once that CO2 regulator says, oh, it's enough, it'll
[27:48.000 --> 27:49.000]  turn that right off for you.
[27:49.000 --> 27:54.000]  So that is the best way, in my opinion, to set up CO2 in a small grow.
[27:54.000 --> 27:57.000]  That's very similar to the way it's done in a large commercial grow.
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.000]  We do the same lines above the canopy.
[27:59.000 --> 28:02.000]  Of course, the lines are much longer, and of course, we're not running to the
[28:02.000 --> 28:05.000]  grow store to refill our canisters all the time.
[28:05.000 --> 28:09.000]  We have a truck that comes, and they actually link up to a giant set of
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.000]  canisters outside.
[28:11.000 --> 28:15.000]  There are about a dozen six-foot tall canisters outside that the truck fills
[28:15.000 --> 28:16.000]  for us.
[28:16.000 --> 28:20.000]  That lasts about half a week, maybe a little less, depending on how many of the
[28:20.000 --> 28:21.000]  rooms are in full flower.
[28:21.000 --> 28:25.000]  But it's very similar to the way it's done in a commercial facility.
[28:25.000 --> 28:30.000]  Now, if you don't want to use the CO2 monitor, I understand they're expensive,
[28:30.000 --> 28:33.000]  you can put the regulator on a timer.
[28:33.000 --> 28:37.000]  But when you do that, how do you know how much CO2 is in that room?
[28:37.000 --> 28:40.000]  How do you know if you even need to add CO2?
[28:40.000 --> 28:43.000]  How do you know if you haven't overdone it and you're not wasting CO2 at this
[28:43.000 --> 28:44.000]  point?
[28:44.000 --> 28:48.000]  I think a CO2 monitor is really worth the money you're going to spend because
[28:48.000 --> 28:51.000]  then you can save on CO2 in the long run.
[28:51.000 --> 28:52.000]  You won't be overdoing it.
[28:52.000 --> 28:54.000]  You won't be wasting CO2.
[28:54.000 --> 28:57.000]  You won't just be blasting CO2 into the room and wondering what's in there.
[28:57.000 --> 29:00.000]  I like knowing what's happening in my grow rooms, if they're big, if they're
[29:00.000 --> 29:01.000]  small.
[29:01.000 --> 29:05.000]  It's always better to take good notes and understand what is happening in there
[29:05.000 --> 29:09.000]  instead of just blasting something that you're paying a lot of money for and
[29:09.000 --> 29:11.000]  not understanding any type of results.
[29:11.000 --> 29:16.000]  So if I'm paying money for CO2, I would like to have a CO2 monitor just to see
[29:16.000 --> 29:19.000]  some sort of number go up, just to see my money turn into something.
[29:19.000 --> 29:24.000]  Even if it's just a number on that monitor, I want to see some kind of result.
[29:24.000 --> 29:29.000]  So that is my quick sidebar on CO2 augmentation and CO2 equipment.
[29:29.000 --> 29:31.000]  I feel like that fit perfectly right there.
[29:31.000 --> 29:35.000]  I feel like this series of grow lessons is off to a great start.
[29:35.000 --> 29:37.000]  We've got some goals in mind for the grow.
[29:37.000 --> 29:39.000]  We know what to expect from the grow.
[29:39.000 --> 29:41.000]  We know where to put the grow.
[29:41.000 --> 29:44.000]  We have a good understanding of what equipment we need for the grow.
[29:44.000 --> 29:46.000]  We've learned how to set up our lighting.
[29:46.000 --> 29:48.000]  We've learned how to set up our air conditioning.
[29:48.000 --> 29:52.000]  We understand what type of humidifier and dehumidifier we might need.
[29:52.000 --> 29:55.000]  We've got a good understanding of how to set up our CO2.
[29:55.000 --> 29:58.000]  I think we are off to a really good start.
[29:58.000 --> 30:03.000]  In the next episode, I plan to talk about selecting the appropriate pots, soil,
[30:03.000 --> 30:05.000]  and nutrients for your grow.
[30:05.000 --> 30:10.000]  After that, we'll work our way into integrated pest management.
[30:10.000 --> 30:14.000]  Before I start wrapping up the show, I really want to thank you guys for listening to these grow lessons.

[30:44.000 --> 30:47.000]  I want to give a huge shout out to my buddy, Tommy Dubs.
