[01:48.440 --> 01:51.960]  There we go. There we go. It's a little better. How you guys doing today? I got a bunch of
[01:51.960 --> 01:56.880]  news articles for you. Before we get to the news articles, I want to talk about something
[01:56.880 --> 02:02.560]  that I watched this weekend. I didn't get to go, but I definitely jumped on the internet
[02:02.560 --> 02:08.900]  and saw some replays. The Grateful Dead did some shows in Santa Clara this weekend. Anybody
[02:08.900 --> 02:12.620]  that knows me knows that I'm a huge Grateful Dead fan. The Grateful Dead has a lot to do
[02:12.620 --> 02:18.980]  with who I am and why I am who I am and what I am. I've been a Grateful Dead fan. I've
[02:18.980 --> 02:24.140]  been a Jerry Garcia fan. I've been a Jamrock fan since the early 90s, probably 93. No,
[02:24.140 --> 02:30.620]  I'm going to say 95 because I moved here late 94, early 94, whatever. But anyway, my first
[02:30.620 --> 02:36.700]  fish show was 6995. I've been listening to the Dead, Fish, all of that stuff heavily,
[02:37.500 --> 02:42.380]  since 95. I did a whole bunch of fish shows. Me and my best friend, Rob the Dude, did a
[02:42.380 --> 02:47.900]  whole bunch of widespread panic shows one summer, Summer Tour 2001. We did about 20
[02:47.900 --> 02:53.420]  shows. That was pretty epic. The Grateful Dead is a huge part of why I am who I am.
[02:53.420 --> 02:59.860]  I learned a lot of things on Fish Tour a lot and further festival parking lots and what
[02:59.860 --> 03:04.900]  have you. I watched these. The Grateful Dead got back together. Of course, Jerry Garcia
[03:04.900 --> 03:09.740]  is no longer with us. He's been gone for several years now. So filling in Jerry's shoes
[03:09.740 --> 03:15.780]  was Trey from Fish, which you would think that's like most of Fish and Grateful Dead
[03:15.780 --> 03:21.040]  fans biggest wet dream. But it almost it was so overhyped and so big that it just seemed
[03:21.040 --> 03:24.740]  weird to me. It seemed like a big commercial thing. It seemed right. Trey was the dude
[03:24.740 --> 03:29.820]  to choose, but it was almost it put up so much hype and so much expectation and so much
[03:29.820 --> 03:34.980]  pressure that it was just weird. So watching the I didn't I didn't go to the shows. I
[03:34.980 --> 03:38.180]  should have gone, but that was it's hella expensive. I got a lot of responsibilities.
[03:38.180 --> 03:42.980]  I didn't feel like you'd be right to go take a week off to go to some shows right now.
[03:42.980 --> 03:48.540]  But I did watch them online. It's the first two shows that they've done. These guys have
[03:48.540 --> 03:51.260]  never done a show together. So it's the first two shows they've done in public and they've
[03:51.260 --> 03:56.900]  got three more shows coming up over the Fourth of July weekend. I was totally satisfied with
[03:56.980 --> 04:02.300]  what I saw, but it seemed really weird watching it. It was like watching a Grateful Dead cover
[04:02.300 --> 04:08.540]  band do Grateful Dead songs. They didn't feel natural. They didn't flow. Something wasn't
[04:08.540 --> 04:14.220]  meshing. There was not a leader to that band is something that I think I noticed that band
[04:14.220 --> 04:19.460]  doesn't have a solid leader. Bobby's trying to lead the band, but it doesn't seem like
[04:19.460 --> 04:25.620]  he's able to get control because no one wants to listen to him. Trey seems timid. He doesn't
[04:25.620 --> 04:30.340]  want to let loose and solo like he should. But by the end of the second show, it felt
[04:30.340 --> 04:33.420]  like everything was right. But that was the end of the second show. And that was the end
[04:33.420 --> 04:37.340]  of the weekend and everything was wrapping up. So I'm hoping that by the time they get
[04:37.340 --> 04:42.180]  to the Chicago venue, by the time this show comes out, they will be in Chicago and they
[04:42.180 --> 04:45.900]  will be setting up. They may have already even played. I'm not sure if this will come
[04:45.900 --> 04:49.900]  out on Thursday or Monday. We'll see how things go. But I hope I can get it out for you by
[04:49.900 --> 04:54.500]  Thursday. So yeah, the Grateful Dead, they've got some improvement to do. Hopefully they
[04:54.500 --> 04:58.460]  talk about what didn't work while they're on the road and then they figured out by the
[04:58.460 --> 05:02.540]  weekend. I'm thinking that they saved up the better songs that they practiced for. I'm
[05:02.540 --> 05:06.820]  not saying the setlist over this weekend wasn't amazing. All of the songs were great, but
[05:06.820 --> 05:11.740]  I'm hoping that they saved up some of the more. Trey didn't sing, but for one song this
[05:11.740 --> 05:18.380]  whole weekend. So I'm hoping they got more Trey songs lined up for the Chicago shows.
[05:18.380 --> 05:23.340]  I'm hoping that we get to hear Terrapin Station with Trey on vocals. There are several that
[05:23.340 --> 05:27.740]  I would like to hear Trey sing. So I'm probably boring the hell out of a lot of my fans with
[05:27.740 --> 05:31.340]  my Grateful Dead talk. A lot of the people listening, but the Grateful Dead is a big
[05:31.340 --> 05:35.300]  part of who I am. So I really wanted to talk about that. The Grateful Dead, they're going
[05:35.300 --> 05:41.660]  to Chicago over the 4th of July weekend. Check that shit out. That'll be really neat. So
[05:41.660 --> 05:47.740]  my next topic, I have a friend named, his name is Tim and he actually has a company
[05:47.740 --> 05:52.780]  that sells a product called a Torchless Nail and is a torchless dab nail. And I've been
[05:52.780 --> 05:58.180]  very curious about this product. So Tim was passing through, Tim does not live in Colorado.
[05:58.180 --> 06:02.940]  He lives in another state, but he was passing through my town and he was kind enough. I
[06:02.940 --> 06:06.180]  always, Tim, if you're passing through dude, you're always invited here to come take some
[06:06.180 --> 06:10.100]  dabs at my house. Even if you don't have cool toys with you, even if you don't have top
[06:10.100 --> 06:14.980]  shelf extracts with you, you're always welcome. I did not purchase one at this time, but I
[06:14.980 --> 06:19.660]  will in the future. It's not something that's in my budget or my need right now, but when
[06:19.660 --> 06:24.500]  I'm ready for it, I'm going to grab one of these things. It's called the Torchless Nail.
[06:24.500 --> 06:33.460]  It is a dab nail that attaches to any rig that is basically battery operated. So you,
[06:33.460 --> 06:36.740]  it's got a battery pack. The battery pack is kind of big and kind of cumbersome to be
[06:36.740 --> 06:41.860]  honest with you. It's the size of a remote control, but it is heavier than a remote control.
[06:41.860 --> 06:46.460]  If you used to drive RC cars, it's like an old RC car battery is what it reminds me of.
[06:46.460 --> 06:50.020]  So you plug in, this thing has a plugin that comes undone. So you don't always have to
[06:50.020 --> 06:53.860]  have a cord hanging from it, but you plug it in, it charges. Then the coil attaches
[06:53.860 --> 06:58.980]  to it. And then the coil attaches to a bowl piece, which fits onto your bong or your rig
[06:58.980 --> 07:04.060]  or whatever you want to call it, whatever you're using, it attaches to your glass piece.
[07:04.060 --> 07:09.260]  Then the battery pack has a button when you hold the button, that heats up an element
[07:09.260 --> 07:15.500]  inside of the bowl piece that makes your hash, your shatter. You know what we tried on it
[07:15.500 --> 07:21.100]  with shatter and butter and wax. I did not try solventless. I did not try the, I didn't
[07:21.100 --> 07:27.180]  try anything else. So I only know how this works for shatter, wax, and some buttery type
[07:27.180 --> 07:32.620]  hash. So we put plenty, and you can stuff this thing with plenty of hash too. We put
[07:32.620 --> 07:36.380]  a lot of hash on there, like probably a half a gram. And then you push the button and hold
[07:36.380 --> 07:40.460]  the button. And as soon as you push it, the hash starts melting. It takes like, it's a
[07:40.460 --> 07:45.500]  very little delay. So you start toking and you, once you start getting smoke into your
[07:45.500 --> 07:49.420]  lungs, once you start feeling it, then I started kind of feathering the button, just like,
[07:49.420 --> 07:52.940]  let it go, hold it, let it go, hold it, let it go, hold it. Cause I like to take a big
[07:52.940 --> 07:57.620]  chunky dab. But what I noticed is as soon as you let go of the button, it stops cooking.
[07:57.620 --> 08:02.700]  Like as soon as you let go, so you can really control your dabs. It is kind of nice. Now
[08:02.700 --> 08:07.780]  the part that I was concerned with, and it did pass my inspection. Let me say that before
[08:07.780 --> 08:14.340]  I go too far. The part that I was concerned with is we've got a wire that goes to a bowl
[08:14.340 --> 08:19.900]  and that bowl is heating something inside of the bowl where I'm keeping my extracts.
[08:19.900 --> 08:26.300]  I was worried about heating polyurethane wiring or whatever was inside of that bowl. So my
[08:26.300 --> 08:31.980]  friend Tim gave me the liberty to take this piece apart and inspect it completely. So
[08:31.980 --> 08:36.900]  inside of there, it's a glass bowl. It looks kind of like your normal bong bowl, or if
[08:36.900 --> 08:42.860]  you've got a health stone pipe, it's very similar to that. It's a glass bowl with basically
[08:42.860 --> 08:49.740]  a titanium screen inside of it and wrapped around that titanium screen is, and we weren't
[08:49.740 --> 08:54.640]  sure if it was copper or brass, but wrapped around that titanium screen is a copper or
[08:54.640 --> 08:59.860]  brass coil. It almost looks, uh, it almost looks like an alligator clip or a battery
[08:59.860 --> 09:03.580]  clip for your car. Like where your car battery goes in. It almost looks like that wrapped
[09:03.580 --> 09:09.420]  around a titanium disc placed inside of a glass bowl. So as soon as you press the button,
[09:09.420 --> 09:17.060]  that that copper or brass, uh, element essentially heats up around that titanium disc because
[09:17.060 --> 09:21.540]  of the electricity flowing through it, it heats up and that's what melts your dabs.
[09:21.540 --> 09:25.300]  And then as soon as you let go of it, you can touch the glass and it's not hot. You
[09:25.300 --> 09:31.860]  can hold the glass while you take your dabs and it won't burn you. So if you were to maybe
[09:31.860 --> 09:36.760]  think about dabbing in the car on the road and you didn't want to use the torch, this
[09:36.760 --> 09:43.180]  device would be perfect. Uh, you just push a little button and you inhale and you get
[09:43.180 --> 09:48.740]  pretty healthy, pretty chunky rips. Uh, I have to say the torchless nail is Rostagef
[09:48.740 --> 09:52.900]  approved. I'm going to give it at least a solid four stars. If I could play with it
[09:52.900 --> 09:58.420]  again, I would give it five full stars. I've never done a real full rating test or anything.
[09:58.420 --> 10:01.540]  You know what I mean? We don't have a rating scale, but on a scale of one to five, I'm
[10:01.540 --> 10:05.060]  going to give it a solid four. And then if I get to play with it a couple more times
[10:05.060 --> 10:10.580]  and learn the button feathering, the technique, how much to push and let go, that sucker just
[10:10.580 --> 10:15.020]  might get five stars. You know, I want to compare it. I want to take my normal rig with
[10:15.020 --> 10:19.660]  me for a day and take the torchless nail with me for a day and see which one I end up hitting
[10:19.660 --> 10:23.740]  on the second day. Like day one, maybe I'll get tired of torching, maybe day two or day
[10:23.740 --> 10:28.420]  one, I'll get tired of pushing the button and just see which one I like better. But
[10:28.420 --> 10:31.780]  that's enough ranting about the torchless nail. If you're interested in a torchless
[10:31.780 --> 10:36.220]  nail, let me know. I will put you in touch with my friend who distributes them. We'll
[10:36.220 --> 10:40.560]  try to get you the best deal possible since I just advertised them very well on the podcast
[10:40.560 --> 10:44.700]  for him. Let me say this. He did not pay me to say any of this. He brought the nail to
[10:44.700 --> 10:49.500]  be kind to let me check it out because I told him I was curious about the inside. So big
[10:49.500 --> 10:53.580]  shout out to Tim. If you're listening, thanks for bringing that big shout out to Zach. Happy
[10:53.580 --> 10:58.340]  late birthday, bro. But I hope everything's going well for you. So let's get into some
[10:58.380 --> 11:04.540]  news articles, you guys. On two podcasts ago, our buddy Mike was here and we talked about
[11:04.540 --> 11:12.500]  a raid, a raid where the police officers used a battering ram to bash in the door of a dispensary
[11:12.500 --> 11:16.700]  that the dispensary was open and the door was unlocked. Then they proceeded to treat
[11:16.700 --> 11:21.760]  all of the customers like criminals when nobody was committing a crime. They were actually
[11:21.760 --> 11:26.700]  there to serve a cease and desist order is what they should have done. But instead, they
[11:26.700 --> 11:32.500]  went in. They treated everybody like criminals. They destroyed most of the dispensary. Oh,
[11:32.500 --> 11:39.240]  excuse me. I'm burping. These cops were complete assholes. What I thought they did was completely
[11:39.240 --> 11:44.780]  disrespectful and apparently some other people did too because there is a news article. This
[11:44.780 --> 11:50.520]  news article comes from ABC7.com. I found this on a lot of different places, but this
[11:50.520 --> 11:54.120]  article was the best written and the most understandable and it kept to the point the
[11:54.120 --> 11:59.120]  most and it mentioned some things that a couple of other articles did not mention.
[11:59.120 --> 12:02.240]  Excuse my coughing. I'm going to get into the news article here right after I take a
[12:02.240 --> 12:12.880]  quick drink and then we will get into it. Oh, that was a long drink. But shit. Yeah,
[12:12.880 --> 12:18.840]  it was worth it. All right, this news article comes from ABC7.com and it is written by a
[12:18.840 --> 12:25.400]  man named Greg Lee. This article was posted June 15 2015. It says Long Beach, California
[12:25.400 --> 12:30.640]  a lawsuit was filed Monday by attorney Matthew Pappas on behalf of Sky High Holistic accusing
[12:30.640 --> 12:36.080]  Santa Ana Police Department, the city of Santa Ana and Santa Ana Mayor Miguel Pulido of taking
[12:36.080 --> 12:41.360]  bribes from marijuana dispensaries in exchange for favorable treatment. This following a
[12:41.360 --> 12:46.080]  controversial police raid at the marijuana dispensary on May 26 that was caught on surveillance
[12:46.080 --> 12:51.360]  video and shows police playing darts, an officer making demeaning remarks about an amputee
[12:51.360 --> 12:56.080]  and another officer eating what appears to be pot laced edibles. You guys if you listen
[12:56.080 --> 13:00.400]  to the podcast, we watched the video last time and I'm 90% sure that that dude ate an
[13:00.400 --> 13:04.960]  edible right off of the shelf. Two cops ate edibles right off the shelves. I'll continue
[13:04.960 --> 13:09.480]  with the article. It says it's deplorable that city officials and people seeking financial
[13:09.480 --> 13:14.400]  gain would use the police to accomplish their self serving goals. Papa said at a news conference
[13:14.400 --> 13:18.880]  in Long Beach Pappas outlined the lawsuit he filed in federal court. The suit alleges
[13:18.880 --> 13:23.800]  that Padilla and other city employees favorited certain dispensaries over others. The city
[13:23.800 --> 13:28.480]  of Santa Ana used a lottery system just like 20 pot shops to operate legally under a new
[13:28.480 --> 13:34.960]  voter approved plan. The lawsuit alleges that at least one dispensary which paid Pulido
[13:34.960 --> 13:38.940]  was selected. So this dispensary paid for their fucking spot in the lottery which is
[13:38.940 --> 13:43.840]  shitty and this dude allegedly allegedly I have to use the word allegedly this dude allegedly
[13:43.840 --> 13:49.320]  took the damn money. The article goes on sky high holistic did not win a spot in the
[13:49.320 --> 13:53.440]  lottery and its patients allege that because Pulido and other city employees had financial
[13:53.440 --> 13:57.620]  ties with competing marijuana dispensaries they use their positions to close down the
[13:57.620 --> 14:03.160]  competition including including shutting down power and water services the suit said. Papa's
[14:03.160 --> 14:07.040]  released an edited surveillance video last week showing what the lawsuit describes as
[14:07.040 --> 14:11.440]  excessive and unreasonable actions by police officers during the raid. And I will agree
[14:11.440 --> 14:16.800]  with both of those statements excessive and unreasonable. The suit said that the suit
[14:16.800 --> 14:22.360]  said officers caused more than $100,000 to video surveillance equipment safes furniture
[14:22.360 --> 14:28.080]  doors and other property. An internal investigation by the Santa Ana Police Department is ongoing.
[14:28.080 --> 14:35.400]  Retired LA LAPD Deputy Chief Stephen Downing echoed at the accusations at the news conference
[14:35.400 --> 14:40.240]  Monday. Police officers should not behave that way. It was unprofessional Downing said
[14:40.240 --> 14:45.720]  Pulido recently released the video statement Monday afternoon in response to the lawsuit.
[14:45.720 --> 14:50.080]  These allegations are unequivocally false and the city will be responding to this lawsuit.
[14:50.080 --> 14:55.040]  He also said he has no financial interest or stake in any dispensary. This article was
[14:55.040 --> 14:59.440]  from the Associated the Associated Press did contribute to this article I have to mention
[14:59.440 --> 15:05.280]  that part at the end. So they are suing they are going to file a lawsuit they have filed
[15:05.280 --> 15:10.880]  a lawsuit against the cops that did this shit. So hopefully they don't get away with
[15:10.880 --> 15:17.120]  this. Hopefully this sets a new standard. You know, maybe this will make a difference.
[15:17.120 --> 15:23.320]  We can't have cops raiding places and eating edibles. So they did over $100,000 in damage.
[15:23.320 --> 15:28.280]  I hope they sue these guys for what like three or four times that because you're gonna have
[15:28.280 --> 15:32.760]  to fix it and then you're gonna have to recoup your losses. You're gonna have to catch up
[15:32.760 --> 15:35.760]  from all the business that you've missed. Yeah, I hope they soon for at least three
[15:35.760 --> 15:41.320]  or four times this part. All right, I'm gonna move on to another news article here. Which
[15:41.320 --> 15:47.760]  one is next? All right, here we go. This one is from ooh, right here at home the Pueblo
[15:47.760 --> 15:56.160]  chieftain. This one says Colorado workers can be fired for using pot off duty. This
[15:56.160 --> 16:00.640]  article is from Denver. It's written by Kristen Wyatt of the Associated Press. It says pot
[16:00.640 --> 16:04.600]  may be legal in Colorado, but you can still be fired for using it. The state Supreme Court
[16:04.600 --> 16:08.920]  ruled five to one Monday that a medical marijuana patient who was fired for failing a drug test
[16:08.920 --> 16:13.400]  cannot get his job back. The case was being watched closely by employers and pot smokers
[16:13.400 --> 16:17.760]  and states that have legalized medical or recreational marijuana. Colorado became the
[16:17.760 --> 16:22.400]  fourth state in which courts have ruled against medical marijuana patients fired for pot use.
[16:22.400 --> 16:27.320]  Supreme Courts in California, Montana and Washington State have made similar rulings.
[16:27.320 --> 16:31.640]  So I'm gonna jump in here for a minute. This article kind of frustrated a lot of people,
[16:31.640 --> 16:36.760]  but honestly, nothing has changed with this new ruling. Colorado has always been an at
[16:36.760 --> 16:41.080]  will state, which means you can be fired for anything or nothing. You don't have to be
[16:41.080 --> 16:44.080]  given a reason. Your boss can walk up and say, guess what? You're fired. Here's your
[16:44.080 --> 16:49.860]  last paycheck. So at any minute, you can be fired for no reason. It's an at will state.
[16:49.860 --> 16:57.860]  So even if they did find cannabis in your system and it was legal, they could still
[16:57.860 --> 17:01.220]  fire you if they wanted to. They could just say, ha ha, you're fired. But all right, let
[17:01.220 --> 17:05.260]  me get back into the article. Where the hell was I? All right. The Colorado worker, Brandon
[17:05.260 --> 17:10.880]  Coats is a quadriplegic who was fired by Dish Network after failing a drug test in 2010.
[17:10.880 --> 17:14.280]  The company agreed that Coats wasn't high on the job, but they said they have a zero
[17:14.280 --> 17:18.860]  tolerance drug policy. Coats argued that his pot smoking was allowed under a state law
[17:18.860 --> 17:23.300]  intended to protect employees from being fired for illegal activities off the clock.
[17:23.300 --> 17:28.700]  Coats didn't use marijuana at work, but pots intoxicating chemical THC. Holy crap. Excuse
[17:28.700 --> 17:33.440]  me. Pots intoxicating chemical THC can stay in the system for weeks. And once again, these
[17:33.440 --> 17:37.560]  guys used chemical. I don't think the word chemical is appropriate there, but we'll just
[17:37.560 --> 17:42.700]  let them do their thing. They are professionals. I'm going to go on with the article. The Colorado
[17:42.700 --> 17:46.700]  justice ruled that because marijuana is illegal under federal law, Coats's use of the drug
[17:46.700 --> 17:51.420]  couldn't be considered legal off duty activity. There's no exception for marijuana use for
[17:51.420 --> 17:56.980]  medicinal purposes or for marijuana use conducted in accordance with state law. The court wrote
[17:56.980 --> 18:01.020]  Coats and his lawyers said after the ruling that the decision at least clarified the matters
[18:01.020 --> 18:05.760]  for workers. Although I'm very disappointed today, I hope that my case has brought the
[18:05.760 --> 18:12.460]  issue of use of medical marijuana and employment to light. Coats said in a statement, attorneys
[18:12.460 --> 18:16.900]  for dish network and the state of Colorado, which filed a brief, uh, filed a brief in
[18:16.900 --> 18:21.780]  support of the company. We're not immediately available for comment. 23 States and Washington,
[18:21.780 --> 18:27.820]  DC allow medical marijuana, Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington state and Washington, DC
[18:27.820 --> 18:30.020]  have legalized recreational sales.
[18:30.020 --> 18:35.100]  The court cases so far have involved medical patients. The Colorado constitution specifically
[18:35.100 --> 18:39.740]  states that employers don't have to amend their policies to accommodate employees. Marijuana
[18:39.740 --> 18:45.660]  use. Coats was paralyzed in a car crash as a teenager and has been a medical marijuana
[18:45.660 --> 18:50.860]  patient since 2009 when he discovered that pot helped calm violent muscle spasms. He
[18:50.860 --> 18:54.560]  was a telephone operator with dish for three years before he failed a random drug test
[18:54.560 --> 19:00.500]  in 2010 and was fired. Uh, he said he told his supervisor in advance that he would probably
[19:00.500 --> 19:06.700]  fail the drug test. So big shout out to what's his name. Brandon Coats. Was that the guy's
[19:06.700 --> 19:10.460]  name? I read it so quickly at Brandon coats, big shout out to this guy. He did lose his
[19:10.460 --> 19:14.460]  job, but he tried to stand up for himself and he took it like a champ, dude. He said,
[19:14.460 --> 19:18.540]  well, shit, at least we know now, at least it's not an ambiguous law. So I'm going to
[19:18.540 --> 19:22.340]  jump in right now and say something. You guys, I am on Periscope while I'm recording this
[19:22.340 --> 19:23.340]  podcast.
[19:23.340 --> 19:27.260]  Uh, I am on an application called Periscope where it's a video app where people are just
[19:27.260 --> 19:30.820]  watching me record and they're throwing comments and questions at me. And I just want to tell
[19:30.820 --> 19:36.660]  them I'm not watching the comments right now. You guys, I'm just doing the podcast.
[19:36.660 --> 19:40.180]  I'm focused on this part. Uh, if I need some questions to fill in some part of the show,
[19:40.180 --> 19:44.460]  I may look to you guys for a question or two, but I'm keeping away from the Periscope chat.
[19:44.460 --> 19:47.780]  Sorry if it feels like I've been ignoring you. I'm pretty focused on the podcast over
[19:47.780 --> 19:52.140]  here and getting this part done well. So I'm going to move on to one more news article.
[19:52.140 --> 19:56.200]  Let's see how long we've been recording here. All right, perfect. Yeah. I got time for one
[19:56.200 --> 20:00.840]  more news article. Uh, but thank you guys for watching on Periscope. If you are watching
[20:00.840 --> 20:03.880]  there, I do appreciate that. I just don't want to be rude and make you think I'm ignoring
[20:03.880 --> 20:07.640]  you. I'm just trying to stay with the show here. All right. So this next article, I found
[20:07.640 --> 20:12.000]  this, I apologize also for all the throat clearing. You guys, I do fat dabs and I drink
[20:12.000 --> 20:15.240]  caffeine and then I talk for 20 minutes straight and then the throat just goes to shit. I'm
[20:15.240 --> 20:24.840]  going to take a big chug of water and hopefully it'll help out. Shout out to water. I got
[20:24.840 --> 20:28.720]  to love that shit. All right. So this article comes from the cannabis and it is written
[20:28.840 --> 20:36.000]  by, of course it's written by our good friend Ricardo Baca and I, it got my attention because
[20:36.000 --> 20:41.520]  it says Oregon police compare piles of weed to a voodoo donut as visual aid and they actually
[20:41.520 --> 20:46.920]  do this. It says if you're in Oregon and passionate about marijuana reform, Wednesday is legitimately
[20:46.920 --> 20:52.640]  a mammoth day. Starting July 1st, adults can possess and use, grow and share cannabis in
[20:52.640 --> 20:57.080]  Oregon. The shops won't be open just yet. That comes in the fall officials think, but
[20:57.080 --> 21:03.000]  July 1st will represent to many the beginning of a new era in the Pacific Northwest state.
[21:03.000 --> 21:07.240]  But how much marijuana will a person be able to legally possess in Oregon? As our handy
[21:07.240 --> 21:12.160]  Oregon marijuana guide says, anyone over 21 in Oregon can possess up to eight ounces of
[21:12.160 --> 21:17.720]  usable usable marijuana, such as dried buds at home and up to one ounce outside of the
[21:17.720 --> 21:23.840]  home. But especially since weed is coming out of a very dark and grow closet in Oregon,
[21:23.840 --> 21:28.680]  an average pot lender, Portland or sorry, might not know the, how much cannabis makes
[21:28.680 --> 21:32.560]  up an ounce or an eight or eight ounces. Okay, sorry. This article is written. It's
[21:32.560 --> 21:36.840]  all squished into one little frame here. Trying to read it right though. And perhaps they
[21:36.840 --> 21:40.840]  don't have a laboratory grade digitally calibrated scale on their desk drawer either. Oh, they
[21:40.840 --> 21:44.160]  should. If you're in Colorado, everyone's got a digi scale now, but then it says, fear
[21:44.160 --> 21:49.240]  not legal weed aficionados. The Portland police are here to help in a very straightforward
[21:49.240 --> 21:53.380]  and almost sweetly maternal blog. The department encourages community members to be responsible
[21:53.920 --> 21:58.400]  and considerate with a recreational marijuana. They tell people that stone driving is a crime.
[21:58.400 --> 22:02.260]  Public consumption could result in a citation and bringing Washington bought weed into Oregon
[22:02.260 --> 22:07.420]  as a federal no, no. With that last note being a bit of a turnaround from the department's
[22:07.420 --> 22:10.780]  previous statements. So they must've went back on something they said earlier. We'll
[22:10.780 --> 22:15.340]  have to research that. So the best part of the Portland police memo, the visual aid that
[22:15.340 --> 22:20.700]  compares a pile of weed to a voodoo donut, one of the state's most celebrated edibles,
[22:20.700 --> 22:25.020]  which is not, of course is not infused. It's one of the most popular snacks in Portland.
[22:25.020 --> 22:29.220]  If you ever go there, you have to have a voodoo donut. It is definitely super popular. All
[22:29.220 --> 22:31.860]  my friends in Portland always talk about it. I hate you guys that are eating them right
[22:31.860 --> 22:36.540]  now. Send me one anyway. So it says, so how much weed makes up an ounce? The legal amount
[22:36.540 --> 22:40.700]  you'll be able to have on your person in Oregon about the size of a donut, if not a little
[22:40.700 --> 22:45.980]  bigger. So imagine that you guys in Oregon, you're allowed to have a donut pile sized
[22:45.980 --> 22:49.180]  amount of weed. So if you get pulled over by the cops and you got some weed on you,
[22:49.420 --> 22:53.020]  they're like, how much weed you got? And you're like this much. Is that cop going to go to his
[22:53.020 --> 22:57.260]  car and pull out his donut and fucking set the donuts? Cause you know, the cop's got a donut in
[22:57.260 --> 23:01.180]  the car. Is he going to go get a donut and set that donut down and set it next to your urban?
[23:01.180 --> 23:05.660]  Be like, Hey, I think you're cool, bro. You can get away with that. That's going to be fucking
[23:05.660 --> 23:09.180]  funny. All right. And then it says, what about eight ounces? The legal amount you're able to have
[23:09.740 --> 23:14.540]  at home in Oregon about the size of a pile of donuts. It doesn't completely dwarf the donut.
[23:15.180 --> 23:19.820]  Uh, he'd be able to climb. Oh, he'd be able to climb that pile of weed if he could climb. So
[23:20.460 --> 23:23.020]  you'd have eight donuts worth of weed, right? If you could have eight ounces,
[23:23.020 --> 23:27.420]  you'd have about eight donuts. So you'd have a dozen donuts plus two extra worth of weed.
[23:27.420 --> 23:31.180]  So just visualize that next time you want to know how much weed you can carry around in Portland.
[23:31.180 --> 23:36.380]  This is weird. All right. The article goes on to say it's a genius ploy on the police's part.
[23:36.380 --> 23:40.540]  And the inclusion of donuts inside official police marketing material surely isn't lost on anyone
[23:40.620 --> 23:45.260]  checking out the truly modern graphic. It takes us back. In fact, to when Denver's police had some
[23:45.260 --> 23:49.420]  four 20 friendly fun on their own when they dropped a smart hip hop reference on their
[23:49.420 --> 23:53.740]  official Twitter account on this last four 20 weekend. And I think I remember that they said,
[23:53.740 --> 23:57.980]  uh, we see you rolling and we ain't hating, but then they talked about all the rules that you had
[23:57.980 --> 24:03.100]  to follow to smoke weed in Colorado. All right. So the article goes on to say Portland and Denver
[24:03.100 --> 24:08.300]  will share more than just legal weed on July 1st in December, 2013, the city's beloved voodoo
[24:08.300 --> 24:13.900]  donuts open its first shop outside of Oregon and Denver, of course. So the next time I'm in Denver,
[24:13.900 --> 24:17.980]  I'm definitely going to go grab myself from some voodoo donuts. If there's not a line, there's
[24:17.980 --> 24:22.140]  always a line at that bitch. All right. So shout out to the cannabis. Uh, thanks for letting me
[24:22.140 --> 24:26.860]  read articles from there. So be careful, you guys, if you go to Oregon, make sure to get some donuts.
[24:26.860 --> 24:31.660]  And that way you can measure how much cannabis you can legally possess. You can have one donut
[24:31.660 --> 24:37.020]  on your person or eight donuts worth of weed at your home. Let's see how long we've been recording.
[24:37.020 --> 24:40.620]  I might start wrapping this up. Yeah. We're going to start closing up the show, dude.
[24:40.620 --> 24:45.740]  Uh, let's start closing this up. What do I got? I got some notes somewhere here. I know I got them.
[24:45.740 --> 24:52.460]  I did that. I did that. I did that. Um, let's see. Somebody told me something that really, uh,
[24:52.460 --> 24:56.060]  that really stuck to my head. They said a good ganja farmer will never put something off for
[24:56.060 --> 24:59.260]  tomorrow. If you see it needs to be done today, get in there and do it. That's the difference
[24:59.260 --> 25:03.660]  between growing top shelf buds and mids. And I've never agreed with a statement more. That's
[25:03.660 --> 25:10.620]  definitely something that I agree with. So, uh, you guys, Spencer should be on a show pretty soon.
[25:10.620 --> 25:16.380]  I'm going to do a show about improving your garden pretty soon. We're going to do, I'm going to try
[25:16.380 --> 25:21.820]  to find a photographer to come on here and talk to us about cannabis photography. If you are in,
[25:21.820 --> 25:25.820]  if you're local to me and you're a cannabis photographer, I would love for you to come on
[25:25.820 --> 25:30.620]  the show and teach my listeners how to take better pictures of their ganja plants. I take pretty
[25:30.620 --> 25:34.620]  decent pictures, but I don't think I am an experienced enough photographer to come on here
[25:34.620 --> 25:39.980]  and teach everybody how to do it. Uh, we're also going to talk about ways to improve your crop.
[25:39.980 --> 25:43.580]  I think I said that Spencer will be on here. That'll probably be an episode or two. We've been
[25:43.580 --> 25:47.500]  talking about what we're going to do, trying to schedule that. That dude is heavily scheduled.
[25:47.500 --> 25:52.140]  Big shout out to Maddie. Maddie invited me over tonight. Maddie made blueberry muffins that were
[25:52.140 --> 25:57.900]  freaking delicious. Uh, Maddie actually ran a batch of hash for me. She took some of my nugs
[25:57.900 --> 26:02.060]  and she made me some beautiful shatter. Let me show you what she did. Let me show you what she
[26:02.060 --> 26:05.740]  did. If you're watching on Periscope, I'm going to hold this up to the cam. Nope. It's stuck.
[26:07.420 --> 26:13.900]  It's over here. It's so stuck. Here we go. Maddie did that. So big shout out to Maddie. She made
[26:13.900 --> 26:19.420]  some super fire shatter for me. I appreciate that. Let's see. I got a couple of shout outs to give.
[26:19.420 --> 26:22.860]  I want to give a huge shout out to the spot. I want to give a big shout out to everybody that
[26:22.860 --> 26:27.500]  has started listening to the podcast. You found me on Periscope. I really appreciate that. Also
[26:27.500 --> 26:31.420]  big shout out to everybody who is listening on Periscope and watching on Periscope right now.
[26:31.420 --> 26:35.900]  It's super kind of you. I will be back. This episode is going to come out on Thursday. So I
[26:35.900 --> 26:40.220]  will be back Monday with the whole fresh episode. I got a couple more news articles. I got some
[26:40.220 --> 26:44.460]  things I want to talk to you about. So you guys big shout out to my ninja Spence until next time,
[26:44.460 --> 26:46.860]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[26:51.100 --> 26:59.980]  You put the flower in the grinder and you cry. Mama plays it. Call it rise to the occasion.
[26:59.980 --> 27:04.700]  Fat shatter patties, butter drying in the basement. I don't need no provocation to smoke
[27:04.700 --> 27:08.700]  my occupations to talk, even though it's also making me broke. Come on,
[27:08.700 --> 27:13.660]  Barack Obama got to lend some change with a stroke of a pen. Quit persecuting all of those.
[27:13.660 --> 27:19.900]  You're supposed to defend how to be taking talks of the Saudi. I would leave calling like a falcon
[27:19.900 --> 27:25.020]  on the balcony. I'm tripping when I'm out of weed. I need a Buddha sack that pre 98
[27:25.580 --> 27:32.220]  band. The super rolling never get far. Open in the fresh job. Little Skywalker choking on the
[27:32.220 --> 27:38.460]  death star. Spoiled bragging email coil rapper, royal shatter rappers getting hotter than my oil
[27:38.460 --> 27:43.980]  spatter. My whole click keeps blowing all the glass, growing all the grass and smoking all
[27:43.980 --> 27:49.500]  your hash. It's a green brush, but we just for cash. We're in it for the love to death.
[27:49.660 --> 27:56.140]  Dustin, I'm in the kitchen and I'm frying chicken. I Chinese getting heinie since the 90s.
[27:56.700 --> 28:02.700]  Cold honey in the parchment paper. Hit the nail. Now I'm gone. Like when the wind hits the sail.
[28:03.340 --> 28:08.460]  Mommy keep the bill for me because she know that I'll be doing. Not a beamer. Look like it got you
[28:08.460 --> 28:16.300]  in strong. My bitch is Jewish with a blue thong. Having a war when the route. Adjust the nail on
[28:16.380 --> 28:22.460]  the big. Now I'm sweating. Keep the pen in my pocket. I'm always grabbing seven tabs. Open my
[28:22.460 --> 28:29.900]  Viziano at the table. I'm known to order duck like Donald. My whole click keeps blowing all the glass,
[28:29.900 --> 28:35.980]  growing all the grass and smoking all your hash. It's a green brush, but we just for cash. We're
[28:35.980 --> 28:42.300]  in it for the love to death. Dustin, recession proof. I'll never need a bailout. I'm waiting
[28:42.300 --> 28:47.980]  for the postman. My drugs are on his mail route. I can do anything myself except for self doubt.
[28:47.980 --> 28:53.340]  So I don't ever seek help. I only help out. It's mad work. We do it. Lots of trimming.
[28:53.340 --> 28:58.300]  Then getting stoned like Islamic women. When cops slip in the system is flawed. Isn't it
[28:58.300 --> 29:04.620]  odd? God's given us plans in your stance is that your law forbids. And watch out if you're black.
[29:04.620 --> 29:09.100]  You speak in Spanish because that racist law was made to attack and defeat Hispanics.
[29:09.100 --> 29:13.580]  It's propaganda. We laugh and you read for madness, but the privatized prisons will profit
[29:13.580 --> 29:18.940]  when people vanish. That's why I feel like the loneliest dude. The only one out of my friends
[29:18.940 --> 29:25.020]  without a Mobius to it's rude. I don't collect. I just buy and I use. I kind of use my glass
[29:25.020 --> 29:31.180]  clog trying to fuse. You lose my whole click. Keep blowing all the glass, growing all the grass
[29:31.180 --> 29:36.940]  and smoking all your hash. It's a green brush, but we just for cash. We're in it for the love
[29:36.940 --> 30:04.420]  till death. Dustin. They just learn to. I'm on the ship. I'm on the quay with the eggs, man. I
[30:04.420 --> 30:09.220]  seen you want some other shit. Fabulous makes me want to be more bored. The mothership, the mini
[30:09.220 --> 30:15.380]  to mafia and Darby guns. It's a takeover. Spit and fire like my man Bates glass flamethrower smoking
[30:15.380 --> 30:22.420]  in my bathtub. Fuck the damn club. I'm home alone taking dabs out my hand. It's all American. No
[30:22.420 --> 30:28.420]  phony ish. My only wish is I had a never ending supply in my Bertone dish. Staying at the Radisson
[30:28.420 --> 30:34.260]  taking dabs with Addison. San Francisco stop to meet with Julio and we link with chatting them
[30:34.260 --> 30:40.260]  staying in San Diego backstage at the Bay Cup, blazing with Danny piece to Maguito,
[30:40.260 --> 30:46.500]  Topanito, Daddy Funk, Master Kush twist up a bush and smoke fatties and big ups to easy for like
[30:46.500 --> 30:52.820]  every show. You seem to always save our ass show wherever we go. And my buddy, Juggie acting funny
[30:52.820 --> 30:59.220]  off a hubby bar, looking like a bear with his head stuck in the honey jar. H E Times Suite hit the
[30:59.220 --> 31:05.940]  hard rock rock stars carving out our spot from the bar. My life's one big oil adventure. Rumbling
[31:06.420 --> 31:11.940]  making money's like coil condenser. Let's go. My whole click keeps blowing all the glass
[31:11.940 --> 31:17.300]  growing all the grass is smoking all your hash.
