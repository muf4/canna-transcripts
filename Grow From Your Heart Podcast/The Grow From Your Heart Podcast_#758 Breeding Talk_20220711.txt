[02:07.700 --> 02:11.460]  thank everybody for all of the great comments on the last episode. I know that
[02:11.460 --> 02:15.980]  the 710 episode did come out a little bit early. My recording schedule is a
[02:15.980 --> 02:18.620]  little bit chaotic, a little bit hectic right now. I've got to record the
[02:18.620 --> 02:21.740]  episodes and try to time when they're coming out. Sometimes I miss it by a
[02:21.740 --> 02:26.620]  couple of days. But thank you for the great response to the early 710 episode.
[02:26.620 --> 02:29.980]  Of course, if you haven't listened to that, go listen to the 710 podcast. I do
[02:30.020 --> 02:35.260]  talk about what 710 is, what 710 means to me, how 710 did evolve. Thank you for
[02:35.260 --> 02:38.980]  the great feedback on that. I do appreciate it. It is really lucky that I
[02:38.980 --> 02:43.060]  did record that show early because I tried to record yesterday and I
[02:43.060 --> 02:46.260]  experienced a power outage in my recording space. That's right. The
[02:46.260 --> 02:51.780]  transformer on my block exploded. Smoke came out of it. A bunch of flames came
[02:51.780 --> 02:54.660]  out of it for about a minute and then it petered out. Then the power was out in
[02:54.660 --> 02:59.020]  the whole block for several hours. So there was no work done yesterday. No
[02:59.020 --> 03:03.620]  podcast recording, no seed packaging, no editing, no progress was made. I simply
[03:03.620 --> 03:06.380]  jumped in the car and went for a ride and try to stay cool and keep the phone
[03:06.380 --> 03:10.940]  charged. So I'm really lucky that I did record that 710 episode a little bit
[03:10.940 --> 03:15.340]  early because last night I was unable to utilize the studio space. So here we are
[03:15.340 --> 03:19.380]  catching up today. But there was a power outage. So I'm really lucky that I got
[03:19.380 --> 03:23.860]  that going. Thank you guys for all of the feedback on that 710 episode. I do
[03:23.860 --> 03:27.940]  appreciate it. There is more stuff that I do want to loop back and touch on on
[03:27.940 --> 03:32.260]  that 710 episode. Some things that I may have missed and I was reminded because
[03:32.260 --> 03:37.180]  today I saw a friend buy, a friend of mine went to a bodega. If you live near
[03:37.180 --> 03:41.420]  a bodega you know what that is. Basically just a small store with a bunch of
[03:41.420 --> 03:45.100]  random products in there. A lot of times you'll find ethnic products in there. A
[03:45.100 --> 03:48.780]  lot of times you'll find off-brand products in there. A lot of weird random
[03:48.780 --> 03:52.140]  shit in the bodega but you could survive out of there if you need to. It's
[03:52.140 --> 03:56.900]  basically a convenience store but also a bunch of random items in there. Anyway
[03:56.900 --> 04:02.020]  one of the members of the IRI Army today did pick up a dab rig complete and
[04:02.020 --> 04:06.740]  ready to use for $35 at a bodega. So don't think you've got to spend a ton of
[04:06.740 --> 04:12.300]  money on a smoking device on a good dab rig. I've got rigs that cost, well we
[04:12.300 --> 04:15.580]  don't need to talk about dollars. I've got expensive rigs and more affordable
[04:15.580 --> 04:20.220]  rigs and honestly the rig I hit the most is one of the more affordable devices in
[04:20.220 --> 04:24.500]  my collection. It works well. It functions well. It's clear glass. It
[04:24.500 --> 04:27.700]  doesn't have a lot of color. It's not real fancy but guess what? When I put the
[04:27.700 --> 04:31.740]  dab in the banger, I put the carb cap on it and I inhale that rig punches me in
[04:31.740 --> 04:35.180]  the face. It is it's like a right hand right to the jaw. It's beautiful. I enjoy
[04:35.180 --> 04:38.300]  it. None of the other rigs hit like that. I paid a lot of money for them. They're
[04:38.300 --> 04:41.900]  really pretty. They have a lot of color, a lot of fancy design, a lot of function
[04:41.900 --> 04:45.540]  but they just don't hit like the simple rig. So something I wanted to talk about
[04:45.540 --> 04:50.700]  is small practical affordable rigs are very good for an entry-level dabber.
[04:50.700 --> 04:54.380]  Don't think you've got to spend a lot of money. Get something kind of small. You're
[04:54.420 --> 04:58.940]  not buying a bong. You're buying a dab rig. There's a big difference in smoking
[04:58.940 --> 05:04.180]  a dab than smoking a bong. When you smoke the bong, the idea is to light the bowl
[05:04.180 --> 05:08.460]  and smoke until you get that big glass chamber, that big space, all that area
[05:08.460 --> 05:12.140]  filled with the volume of smoke and then you carve it. You pull the bowl or you
[05:12.140 --> 05:15.100]  pull the carb and then you suck and then all that smoke goes into your face all
[05:15.100 --> 05:20.460]  at once. You get that big bong rip. When we're smoking dabs, we don't need to burn
[05:20.500 --> 05:25.020]  the flour and smoke for so long and fill the chamber. We just need smoke vapor
[05:25.020 --> 05:28.860]  basically to go through the water to cool it down so it doesn't roast my
[05:28.860 --> 05:32.580]  esophagus and then I need it to get into my lungs. I'm not really trying to fill
[05:32.580 --> 05:36.580]  up a big tube and clear it. I can kind of manage that enough with the carb cap by
[05:36.580 --> 05:40.220]  filling the chamber, the little the can on the rig and just fill it enough and
[05:40.220 --> 05:43.500]  keep it going but I don't like a big bong. I'm not going for a big bong rip.
[05:43.500 --> 05:46.500]  With the big bong, you got to smoke forever. You just keep inhaling and
[05:46.500 --> 05:49.620]  inhaling and you don't even get any smoke until you finally pull that carb.
[05:49.740 --> 05:54.300]  With the little rig, as soon as I put my dab onto the banger, as soon as it hits
[05:54.300 --> 05:57.980]  the dab nail and I start sucking, I'm getting a fat dab to my brain. I'm going
[05:57.980 --> 06:01.220]  to cough. My eyes are going to cross. I'm going to go red faced. That's what I'm
[06:01.220 --> 06:05.860]  looking for. So a smaller practical rig is ideal for especially a new dabber.
[06:05.860 --> 06:09.660]  That's what I use is a very small practical rig. It doesn't need a lot of
[06:09.660 --> 06:13.660]  perks, a lot of swirls, a lot of twisties. It doesn't need to be a recycler. I do
[06:13.660 --> 06:17.900]  enjoy my recycler rigs, my end cycler rigs, my fancy shit but honestly my
[06:17.940 --> 06:21.700]  favorite rig doesn't have any of that shit. So if you're going to get a rig,
[06:22.180 --> 06:25.620]  don't think that you need to spend a bunch of money. All the glass sellers out
[06:25.620 --> 06:28.220]  there right now are going, damn it Jeff, we're going to make some money. Just get
[06:28.220 --> 06:32.860]  a rig that functions. It's all about how it works. I prefer a flared out mouthpiece.
[06:33.140 --> 06:36.340]  If the mouthpiece is too little on a rig, I take a big dab. I feel like I get
[06:36.340 --> 06:40.180]  built up concentrates on my lip. I don't like that. I like a flared out mouthpiece.
[06:40.180 --> 06:43.980]  I like something about hand size and I mentioned before, I like it when I go to
[06:43.980 --> 06:47.740]  take the dab that I can look at the banger and not go cross eyed. I don't need
[06:47.740 --> 06:51.700]  to be cross eyed with that. So like a smaller rig. The other things that I did
[06:51.700 --> 06:55.140]  not mention is that you're going to need a torch. You're going to need some way
[06:55.140 --> 06:58.780]  to torch that nail. Do you have a torch? We usually just use a creme brulee
[06:58.780 --> 07:02.980]  torch. Newport makes a good torch. There are a bunch of great torches out there.
[07:03.300 --> 07:07.980]  Again, you don't have to buy the super expensive torch. Those expensive torches
[07:07.980 --> 07:12.860]  will die just like that cheaper torch. So get the torch that fits your budget
[07:12.860 --> 07:16.020]  that makes you happy. The next thing you're going to need is a dabber. If
[07:16.020 --> 07:19.140]  you've got a rig, you've got a banger, you've got a torch. The next thing you
[07:19.140 --> 07:22.140]  need is a dabber. You need something to scoop up that concentrate and put it
[07:22.140 --> 07:27.140]  into the banger. Then I would recommend a carb cap, a carb cap that fits the
[07:27.140 --> 07:31.660]  banger and goes kind of deep down inside. If you are using a terp slurper,
[07:31.660 --> 07:35.620]  most of my advice will not work for you. I'm not a fan of the terp slurper. The
[07:35.620 --> 07:39.380]  community may roast me for that. I am not a big fan of the bird feeder. It
[07:39.380 --> 07:43.420]  doesn't do anything good for me and my dabbing style. I don't like it. I
[07:43.500 --> 07:48.540]  strongly prefer a flat top banger, round bottom, flat top with a carb cap. Let's
[07:48.540 --> 07:53.420]  get it that way. That is my preferred method of dabbing. So you may need a
[07:53.420 --> 07:57.380]  carb cap. The carb cap will definitely increase the quality of your dab all
[07:57.380 --> 08:01.100]  the time. Another thing I recommend is Q-tips. As soon as you're done dabbing,
[08:01.100 --> 08:05.340]  grab a good quality Q-tip. Don't get the shit that melts. Those cheap Q-tips
[08:05.340 --> 08:09.820]  will melt. Get good like glob fathers or dab mops or something like that. Some
[08:10.020 --> 08:14.100]  quality Q-tips or if you go to Dillard's and go to the makeup section, those Q-tips
[08:14.100 --> 08:17.180]  those are great. They're makeup Q-tips. They're better quality than the shit you
[08:17.180 --> 08:20.340]  use in your ear. Those will melt. So get some Q-tips. As soon as you're done
[08:20.340 --> 08:24.860]  dabbing, grab that Q-tip and clean out the residual oil or the residual wax in
[08:24.860 --> 08:28.820]  your banger and that'll help you keep it clean. Also, I recommend some rubbing
[08:28.820 --> 08:31.940]  alcohol. You're going to need to clean that dab rig. All your tools are going to
[08:31.940 --> 08:37.180]  get sticky. 91% isopropyl alcohol is your friend. In a previous episode, I did
[08:37.180 --> 08:41.820]  recommend a product called Dark Crystal. Dark Crystal is available on Amazon.
[08:42.060 --> 08:45.980]  It's a great product if you can afford it. Heat it up a little bit. People think
[08:45.980 --> 08:48.740]  I'm crazy when I say that. The instructions say to heat it up a little
[08:48.740 --> 08:52.460]  bit. It works so much better when it's hot and you cannot heat up the alcohol
[08:52.860 --> 08:57.380]  as hot safely. You could probably, but I'm not going to do that. But heat up
[08:57.380 --> 09:02.140]  the Dark Crystal. That shit will clean your glass quite quickly. Another thing
[09:02.140 --> 09:04.780]  I'm going to recommend, they don't pay me to say this, but if you want a really
[09:04.780 --> 09:08.940]  nice and smooth dab, check out the DabRite. That's a good product, the
[09:08.940 --> 09:11.740]  DabRite. You just basically set your banger above it and it'll measure the
[09:11.740 --> 09:15.580]  heat on the surface of your banger. You set a temperature. You tell it, I want
[09:15.580 --> 09:18.620]  to dab at 650. When it's 650, that fucker beeps and you take your dab. It's
[09:18.620 --> 09:23.580]  really great. The rig that I use most of the time, somebody on YouTube asked me,
[09:23.580 --> 09:27.940]  what is that rig? The rig that I was hitting on the previous episode was a
[09:27.940 --> 09:33.340]  Hitman sidecar with a Hammerhead perk. Nothing fancy. It's made by a company
[09:33.340 --> 09:37.260]  called Hitman. It's called a sidecar because it's got a can and the mouthpiece
[09:37.260 --> 09:40.900]  comes off the side. That's a sidecar. It's got a Hammerhead percolator on the
[09:40.900 --> 09:44.500]  inside of it, which means the downstem goes straight down. Then it goes to the
[09:44.500 --> 09:47.780]  left and to the right and it's got holes facing the left and right. It looks like
[09:47.780 --> 09:51.420]  a hammer. If I had it here to show you, it'd look like Thor's hammer. It's a
[09:51.700 --> 09:56.300]  Hitman sidecar with a Hammerhead perk. That's what that is. So if you're
[09:56.300 --> 09:58.620]  looking for that, it'll be hard to find because I don't know if they're making
[09:58.620 --> 10:03.060]  those. Hitman, however, is coming back. Check your local glass shops. Check their
[10:03.060 --> 10:07.620]  website. Harass them on social media. Where was I going next? Not a bong is
[10:07.620 --> 10:11.420]  what I wrote. I've already talked about why not a bong. Why I prefer a little
[10:11.420 --> 10:16.460]  rig. I've talked about the torch. If the torch is not something you're
[10:16.460 --> 10:20.380]  comfortable with, or maybe if you're going to be traveling a lot, maybe the
[10:20.380 --> 10:25.340]  torch isn't for you. Driving and hitting a torching a dab nail is kind of
[10:25.340 --> 10:28.260]  challenging unless you're a pro. Allegedly, I wouldn't recommend it. I've
[10:28.260 --> 10:32.620]  never done that. Wink wink. Something like a puff co, something like that.
[10:32.620 --> 10:35.380]  Maybe a little better for you if you're not into the torch, if you need to be
[10:35.380 --> 10:38.700]  discreet, if you got kids in the house, or if you're gonna be smoking in the car.
[10:38.700 --> 10:42.780]  That dab torch and the hot banger in the car can get quite dangerous if you're
[10:42.780 --> 10:47.300]  not super coordinated. If you are clumsy and accident-prone, maybe consider
[10:47.300 --> 10:52.140]  something like the puff co. Also think about the e-nail. If you're clumsy, you'll
[10:52.140 --> 10:54.580]  burn the shit out of yourself with the e-nail, but you don't have to mess with
[10:54.580 --> 10:59.100]  the torch and it's always there ready to rock. Alright, I feel like that's a good
[10:59.100 --> 11:02.900]  recap of the things I may have missed on the 710 episode. I hope I got you up
[11:02.900 --> 11:06.740]  to speed. If there's any more stuff that I missed, of course, please do send me an
[11:06.740 --> 11:11.260]  email. The email address is grow from your heart at hotmail.com. I will get the
[11:11.260 --> 11:15.620]  updates on the show. Now let's talk about more grow questions. I was recently asked
[11:15.620 --> 11:20.380]  a question that I'm asked a lot and I don't know if I address it enough
[11:20.380 --> 11:24.740]  publicly. I don't know if I've said this enough to where people know my answer. So
[11:24.860 --> 11:30.300]  not only am I a podcaster, I'm also the breeder for IRI Genetics Premium Seeds. I
[11:30.300 --> 11:35.380]  own IRI Genetics Premium Seeds. I make high-quality regular and feminized seeds.
[11:35.380 --> 11:41.500]  So somebody asked me today, again, how do I feel about people breeding with the
[11:41.500 --> 11:45.820]  seeds that I have created? And I've always had the same answer. Hopefully, I
[11:45.820 --> 11:48.500]  will always continue to have this attitude and the same answer, but the
[11:48.500 --> 11:54.540]  answer is go ahead and breed with my seeds. If you acquired my seeds in an
[11:54.540 --> 11:57.700]  ethical way, if you didn't steal them or rip somebody off for them or lie to
[11:57.700 --> 12:01.340]  somebody to get them, if you got them in a positive way, I give you full
[12:01.340 --> 12:06.300]  permission to breed with the seeds that I've made. I'm not territorial. I'm not,
[12:06.300 --> 12:10.140]  I guess territorial is the word that I'm not possessive with my seeds. You paid
[12:10.140 --> 12:14.300]  for them. They're yours. Have a good time. Just like all the seeds I bought or
[12:14.300 --> 12:19.060]  let's talk even further down the line. I didn't invent cannabis in any way. We
[12:19.060 --> 12:22.820]  all know that Willie Nelson and Bob Marley invented cannabis in 1952. If you
[12:22.820 --> 12:26.380]  don't know that, read the story. So I did not invent cannabis, which means I did
[12:26.380 --> 12:30.300]  not have seeds to start with. I didn't just sneeze and have male seeds and
[12:30.300 --> 12:33.460]  sneeze and have female seeds or sneeze and have a male plant and cough out a
[12:33.460 --> 12:37.900]  female plant and start breeding. I had to get seeds and plants somewhere. So I'm
[12:37.900 --> 12:42.540]  working with other breeders plants and other breeders seeds. So if I wasn't
[12:42.540 --> 12:46.940]  using other breeders shit, then I would not be breeding or working with cannabis
[12:46.940 --> 12:50.900]  in any way. Every plant that I used, use had to come from somewhere to get me
[12:50.900 --> 12:55.740]  started. I didn't, I didn't invent this cannabis. So, uh, that being said, I give
[12:55.740 --> 12:59.820]  you permission to breed with anything that I have put out there. I do have a
[12:59.820 --> 13:04.260]  couple of stipulations and maybe a couple of by the ways with that. It
[13:04.260 --> 13:08.620]  would be cool if you give me credit when you breed to my stuff. If you make a
[13:08.620 --> 13:12.060]  cross and you put it out or you talk about it on social media, it would be
[13:12.060 --> 13:15.940]  kind of you to say, this is my, whatever you're going to call it today, we're
[13:15.940 --> 13:20.060]  going to call it black microphone. This is black microphone and it's my, this
[13:20.180 --> 13:24.500]  cross to Rasta Jeff's, whatever. Just tell people it's the IRI genetics cross
[13:24.500 --> 13:27.620]  in there. Uh, honestly, if you're a new breeder, if you're getting started, that
[13:27.620 --> 13:31.780]  may give you an advantage that may help you out. But also that just shows, uh,
[13:31.780 --> 13:34.980]  it shows respect and gives me credit. It tells people what you're working with.
[13:35.260 --> 13:39.980]  Never ever, uh, in any way, for any reason, change the names, change the
[13:39.980 --> 13:44.380]  stories and change the crosses of your stuff, of my stuff, of any stuff. If
[13:44.380 --> 13:47.660]  you're breeding, tell the truth, we need to know what's in there. We need to
[13:47.660 --> 13:51.820]  know what plants were used to make that cross. Many people are using cannabis as
[13:51.820 --> 13:55.580]  a medical, uh, medical remedy and they want to know what genetics they're
[13:55.580 --> 13:59.260]  smoking because it'll have certain effects for certain ailments. I know some
[13:59.260 --> 14:02.020]  people that won't smoke a sativa like dope. I'll be too high. I'll have a
[14:02.020 --> 14:05.420]  panic attack. I know some people that really love certain strains and really
[14:05.420 --> 14:08.980]  hate certain strains. So let's stay honest with the labeling and let's not
[14:08.980 --> 14:12.100]  change any names. That's really important when you do go breeding with
[14:12.100 --> 14:16.220]  anybody's stuff. Just give us credit, honor us, honor your elders. I think
[14:16.220 --> 14:19.380]  it's really, it shows a lot when you reveal your source. A lot of times
[14:19.380 --> 14:23.060]  you'll hear me say, I learned this from this person because I'm not the wizard
[14:23.060 --> 14:26.860]  of Oz. Like I said, I did not invent cannabis. I'm also not a weed genius.
[14:27.140 --> 14:30.660]  I've got a lot of mentors, a lot of teachers, a lot of people around me and
[14:30.660 --> 14:34.860]  I absorb information very well, but I do not think I'm the wizard of Oz or some
[14:34.860 --> 14:39.260]  cannabis guru guru. I just read a lot and absorb a lot of information. So I do
[14:39.260 --> 14:42.700]  give you full permission to breed with my seeds. Another thing I'm going to ask
[14:42.700 --> 14:48.540]  for is if you do go breeding with my stuff, maybe create something and then
[14:48.540 --> 14:51.540]  breed with it. I know you've got to work with it to breed with it, but if you're
[14:51.540 --> 14:55.060]  going to put stuff out to market, here's what I'm asking. If you plan on putting,
[14:55.260 --> 14:57.820]  if you're going to make seeds for yourself, have fun, do whatever you want.
[14:58.060 --> 15:01.500]  Breed them, Paul and Chuck, share with your friends, do your thing. If you plan
[15:01.500 --> 15:06.020]  on putting seeds out to the market, this is what would be polite. Don't just take
[15:06.180 --> 15:09.220]  my, what's your, what's popular right now. We're going to say fist bump. If you
[15:09.220 --> 15:12.460]  haven't heard about the cross fist bump, you're missing it. Check it out. Uh, I
[15:12.500 --> 15:15.940]  read genetics.com slash I read dash direct. I think we'll get you there, but
[15:15.940 --> 15:19.700]  check out, I read direct, get yourself a pack of fist bump. That is sour diesel to
[15:19.700 --> 15:23.100]  arise. So you've got yourself a pack of fist bump and you want to make a seed
[15:23.100 --> 15:27.740]  company. You can find a male or a female out of that pack of fist bump and breed
[15:27.740 --> 15:32.980]  it to something else and make your own starter male and use that boy for your
[15:32.980 --> 15:37.220]  seed company. But don't just use my fist bump and find a boy and start a seed
[15:37.220 --> 15:41.940]  company off of my fist bump. You can if you want to, but it would be more polite.
[15:41.940 --> 15:46.780]  It would be more yours. If you took a male fist bump from me and a female plant
[15:46.780 --> 15:50.780]  from any other breeder out there and crossed those, then you find your male
[15:50.780 --> 15:55.180]  out of that and then you use that male for your projects. That kind of, that,
[15:55.220 --> 15:58.940]  that does, that makes you do a little bit of work. That, that means that that
[15:58.940 --> 16:01.540]  just shows that you care, that you put some pride into it, that you put some
[16:01.540 --> 16:04.940]  effort into it. You didn't just buy my shit and then just start using my shit
[16:05.060 --> 16:08.100]  to start your own company. Now people are going to say Ross to Jeff, you're
[16:08.100 --> 16:13.180]  making Jack the Ripper F twos off of sub cools company. Yes, that is very true.
[16:13.220 --> 16:16.460]  Let's talk about that for a minute. Um, there are a lot of things to unpack
[16:16.460 --> 16:20.580]  there. First of all, sub cool was somebody that I feel was my mentor. Sub
[16:20.580 --> 16:24.140]  cool was one of my heroes. Sub cool taught me a lot about this business.
[16:24.140 --> 16:28.140]  Sub cool taught me what to do. And also I always say sub cool taught me a lot
[16:28.140 --> 16:33.260]  of what not to do as a cannabis breeder, as a cannabis person. Um, he made a lot
[16:33.260 --> 16:37.340]  of mistakes, but he also made a lot of headway. He carved the path that many of
[16:37.380 --> 16:41.740]  us are walking now. So I felt that it was my responsibility almost to make a
[16:41.740 --> 16:45.420]  tribute strain to sub cool when sub cool passed away. Rest in peace, subby.
[16:45.420 --> 16:49.540]  Love you every day. I miss you bro. You honoree motherfucker. But a sub cool is
[16:49.540 --> 16:54.020]  gone. So I took it upon myself to continue some of sub cools work. Sub cool
[16:54.020 --> 16:58.340]  does not make F twos sub cool. A lot like myself was an F one monster. You had a
[16:58.340 --> 17:01.620]  couple of killer males and he would pollinate everything with those males
[17:01.620 --> 17:05.460]  and it would work. So he had a good plan, a good strategy and sub cool would tell
[17:05.460 --> 17:08.900]  you if it ain't broke, don't fucking fix it. So sub cool was continuing on that
[17:08.900 --> 17:13.140]  path. Sub cool would have never made F twos of Jack the Ripper. Jill may have,
[17:13.140 --> 17:16.580]  uh, Jill may have inspired that Jill may have thought about that along the way.
[17:16.580 --> 17:20.620]  She's more that way in breeding, but sub would have just kept making new shit. So
[17:20.620 --> 17:23.860]  sub was never going to make the Jack the Ripper F twos. I love Jack the Ripper.
[17:23.860 --> 17:27.260]  It really does something special to me. It gets me lit in a way that I really
[17:27.260 --> 17:31.380]  like and it honors a good friend of mine. My mentor, my hero who has fallen.
[17:31.580 --> 17:37.020]  Also, I just mentioned miss Jill, miss Jill, uh, for a long time was, uh, I
[17:37.020 --> 17:40.540]  think they may have been married when sub passed. They, uh, they had a rocky
[17:40.540 --> 17:43.420]  relationship is the best I'll say right here. Jill wouldn't mind me saying that
[17:43.420 --> 17:46.340]  that's fucking well known. I'm pretty sure they were separated but still
[17:46.340 --> 17:51.900]  married when sub passed. However, miss Jill was a big part of TGA team green
[17:51.900 --> 17:55.420]  Avengers, which was part of, that's what sub cool seed company. It was sub cool
[17:55.420 --> 18:00.620]  and miss Jill. They were TGA. There were other people involved also in TGA, but
[18:00.620 --> 18:04.620]  to the best of my knowledge, sub and miss Jill were the core of TGA, the
[18:04.620 --> 18:09.020]  green Avengers. Now, after sub cool passed away, I did the responsible
[18:09.020 --> 18:12.540]  thing. I reached out to my friend and fellow breeder, miss Jill. And I said,
[18:12.540 --> 18:16.340]  Hey, do you care if I work with Jack the Ripper? I want to make F twos and I
[18:16.340 --> 18:19.780]  want to make a bunch of out crosses. And she said, you know what, I'm done with
[18:19.780 --> 18:23.660]  Jack the Ripper and subs obviously done with it. You've got our blessing. Have
[18:23.660 --> 18:27.780]  fun. Do your thing with Jack the Ripper. So I did my work with Jack the Ripper
[18:27.860 --> 18:32.220]  with the blessing of the widow of the breeder who made it, who was also
[18:32.220 --> 18:36.000]  involved in the company. So I feel like I've got permission. I did my due
[18:36.000 --> 18:40.140]  diligence. I did my, it's grace. I did. I've got grace. I did what I needed to
[18:40.140 --> 18:44.140]  do to keep the relationship strong, to keep the business strong and to not feel
[18:44.140 --> 18:47.060]  like a dickhead about it. If you feel like a dickhead about it, you know
[18:47.060 --> 18:51.420]  inside that's when you are doing something wrong ethically. All right. So
[18:51.440 --> 18:56.140]  yes, you can breed with my seeds, but follow the rules. Very few rules. Don't
[18:56.140 --> 18:59.660]  change the names, respect the breeder and pay homage and tribute to the
[18:59.660 --> 19:03.940]  breeder. Then don't go breeding with just my straight up mail. Do some work,
[19:03.940 --> 19:07.460]  find your mail, then do the work, sell those seeds if that's what you choose
[19:07.460 --> 19:12.260]  to do. Something else I should mention, bro, I like seeds too. If you're making
[19:12.260 --> 19:16.020]  shit with my crosses, send me a 10 pack. Come on, I'll take them. I just might
[19:16.020 --> 19:19.220]  grow your seeds out, find something cool and breed it back to some of my other
[19:19.220 --> 19:22.860]  shit and then send you more seeds. It goes that way. Sometimes people get
[19:22.860 --> 19:25.860]  gifts in the mail all the time. Also, I like clones of keepers. If you grow
[19:25.860 --> 19:29.060]  some of my seeds and you find a good keeper, let me know. I do like clones.
[19:29.300 --> 19:32.660]  Where are we going from there? Talk to the breeder. Just tell the breeder,
[19:32.660 --> 19:35.740]  hey, this is what I want to do and see if they have a project similar to what
[19:35.740 --> 19:38.660]  you're going to do lined up or something. You may end up getting to
[19:38.660 --> 19:41.700]  work with the breeder. You never know what could happen. The breeder, a lot
[19:41.700 --> 19:44.240]  of us are really cool. Talk to us, communicate with us. A lot of us have
[19:44.240 --> 19:47.620]  our own discords, our own social media. We want to be your friend. We're weed
[19:47.620 --> 19:52.020]  growers and we're bros to talk to us, see what we are up to. Another important
[19:52.020 --> 19:55.020]  thing I've already mentioned. Don't change the names. Don't change the
[19:55.020 --> 19:58.540]  story. You will be found out. There's a story behind every plant. There's
[19:58.540 --> 20:01.420]  details behind every plant. Somebody gave you that plant. Somebody gave you
[20:01.420 --> 20:04.580]  that seed. Somebody knows the truth. Don't fuck it all up. Let's keep this
[20:04.580 --> 20:09.700]  cannabis story real. There's so much bullshit behind the cannabis plant,
[20:09.700 --> 20:14.100]  behind the cannabis industry, cannabis lore. We've got the internet now. We've
[20:14.100 --> 20:17.660]  got enough resources to clear up bullshit and keep things real. As a
[20:17.660 --> 20:22.220]  podcaster, as a breeder, just with the mindset that I've got, I feel like I'm
[20:22.220 --> 20:25.740]  sort of a cannabis historian. It's my responsibility to make sure that strain
[20:25.740 --> 20:30.220]  details, cannabis history, that all the shit is correct. So help me out with that.
[20:30.220 --> 20:33.460]  You guys, don't fuck up the story. Don't convolute the story of your plants, of
[20:33.460 --> 20:36.940]  your strains. If you don't know, you don't have to chime in. Definitely don't
[20:36.940 --> 20:41.180]  make some shit up and do not change the names. Don't do that dumb shit. When it
[20:41.180 --> 20:44.540]  comes to breeding with my seeds, that was the long rant. The short version is
[20:44.540 --> 20:47.980]  fucking go for it. Have a good time. I encourage it because it's kind of an
[20:47.980 --> 20:51.620]  honor. Like if you're gonna use my plants as breeding stock, that's saying that I
[20:51.660 --> 20:55.300]  made good enough shit to where you trust in it, that you want to breed to it
[20:55.300 --> 20:58.380]  because you like it that much. It's like saying my beats were funky enough you
[20:58.380 --> 21:01.900]  wanted to sample them for your album. Alright, I appreciate that. Do breed with
[21:01.900 --> 21:04.900]  my seeds. I've got another thing I do want to talk about here. Somebody today
[21:04.900 --> 21:08.060]  asked me in a discord chat, big shout out to my friend who asked me, you know who
[21:08.060 --> 21:12.420]  you are. They said, if you could use any plants for breeding, what two plants
[21:12.420 --> 21:16.700]  would you select? And I thought that was a very good question. My answer though
[21:16.780 --> 21:21.900]  was probably not what everybody was hoping for because I don't have two
[21:21.900 --> 21:26.700]  plants in mind that I would love to breed because I can't just tell you that
[21:26.700 --> 21:31.420]  I want to breed to some shit because of the names of the plants. Like apricot
[21:31.420 --> 21:36.940]  kush and fucking vanilla sky would probably taste and smell really good but
[21:36.940 --> 21:40.780]  that's just two names. What does that have to do with those plants? Anything
[21:40.780 --> 21:44.300]  with the plants other than names that some person arbitrarily labeled these
[21:44.380 --> 21:49.980]  plants. I like to pick my breeding pairs by seeing plants. Sometimes I'll be
[21:49.980 --> 21:53.100]  growing out some seeds looking for a female and I'll see a male in there and
[21:53.100 --> 21:57.140]  I'll go, shit, wasn't looking for a boy but that dude right there has got to go
[21:57.140 --> 22:00.700]  into a breeding project. We got another male coming up that we're having a hard
[22:00.700 --> 22:03.300]  time getting, we're running some morphine hunts, we're having a hard time getting
[22:03.300 --> 22:07.860]  rid of some boys because they're showing such potential and it's really hard. So
[22:07.860 --> 22:11.620]  to choose plants just based on names and things without actually seeing plants
[22:11.940 --> 22:15.300]  for a breeding project, I don't think that's right. That's like just scrolling
[22:15.300 --> 22:18.020]  through the phone book and picking a boy name and a girl name and putting them on
[22:18.020 --> 22:21.540]  a date and hoping that it works. I need to actually see the plants. I need to
[22:21.820 --> 22:26.300]  see, I want to see the plants in veg. I want to see the plants in early flower,
[22:26.300 --> 22:30.500]  mid flower and late flower. I want to see what they look like just before harvest.
[22:30.500 --> 22:33.580]  I want to know what the buds taste and smell like. I want to know the density of
[22:33.580 --> 22:37.020]  the buds. I want to know the buzz that it gives me. I want to know what happens if
[22:37.020 --> 22:40.500]  the room got too hot, if the room got too cold, if I took off too many leaves, if I
[22:40.500 --> 22:44.020]  didn't take off enough leaves. I want to know a lot of details about these plants
[22:44.020 --> 22:48.620]  before I choose to breed with them. So just knowing by the name isn't really a
[22:48.620 --> 22:53.580]  way that I would choose to select my breeding pairs. Now let's talk about ways
[22:53.580 --> 22:56.180]  that I actually would do it because I don't want to shoot down your question
[22:56.180 --> 23:01.420]  without a good answer. Currently I've got a King Solomon male. You guys know King
[23:01.420 --> 23:05.940]  Solomon, that's an Arise male. That's kind of 50-50. I know the terms indica and
[23:05.940 --> 23:09.180]  sativa are kind of outdated. Those are going away. But if you were going to
[23:09.180 --> 23:13.620]  label it as an indica or a sativa, my Arise, my King Solomon leans a little
[23:13.620 --> 23:18.580]  bit sativa but he's kind of 50-50-ish. He's kind of 60-40 but he's real close
[23:18.580 --> 23:22.580]  to the middle. He grows real well. He's got a great buzz. That one's kind of 50-50.
[23:22.580 --> 23:27.100]  Then I've got the Jack the Ripper male who is real sativa leaning, real sativa
[23:27.100 --> 23:32.580]  heavy, probably 70-ish, 75-ish percent sativa. Then I've got the BC Lemon
[23:32.580 --> 23:37.340]  Skunk male which that's a lot of sativa which just straight lemon funky flavors
[23:37.340 --> 23:41.020]  in a real particular growth pattern. So if I were gonna pick more plants to
[23:41.020 --> 23:47.100]  breed with, right now I would be looking for a really short, squatty, broad-leafed
[23:47.100 --> 23:53.420]  male that finishes in like eight weeks and produces gassy skunky aromas. Maybe
[23:53.420 --> 23:58.060]  like a Moon Tower male, something that's more couch locky because everything else
[23:58.060 --> 24:04.220]  I'm making is really, it's a head fuck. I like panic attack weed. But to broaden the
[24:04.220 --> 24:09.220]  catalog, to bring some new shit in, maybe I need something more mellow, more
[24:09.220 --> 24:13.660]  indica dominant as the old term we used to use. Some big broad leaves, some gassy
[24:13.660 --> 24:18.180]  aromas. Get that funky gassy aroma that maybe a hint of those burnt tennis balls.
[24:18.180 --> 24:23.540]  Get that and then breed that to all of the other really sweet tropical candy
[24:23.540 --> 24:26.980]  flavored females that I've been collecting. The Strawberry Starburst, the
[24:26.980 --> 24:30.740]  Golden Goat, the Lemon Skunk of course, the Lemon Skunk female. I do have a Lemon Skunk
[24:30.740 --> 24:34.060]  male and a female just because I'm sure it does get confusing from totally
[24:34.060 --> 24:37.620]  different breeders, different batches, but should mention that. But I think the
[24:37.620 --> 24:40.780]  thing I would be looking for now would be more of like a broad-leafed indica
[24:40.780 --> 24:44.380]  type of male that finishes in eight weeks because that is very different
[24:44.380 --> 24:47.780]  than everything else that I've got in my catalog. And when you're breeding things
[24:47.780 --> 24:51.300]  that are very different is when you have great success. So I think that would work
[24:51.300 --> 24:57.060]  well for me. Maybe a Moon Tower male or possibly a Cream male may be good. There
[24:57.060 --> 25:02.220]  could be a Cream male hidden somewhere. You never know. What? Make sure you check
[25:02.220 --> 25:05.380]  on the website. Follow for details. All right. Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls,
[25:05.380 --> 25:09.060]  pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers, clone cutters, pollen chuckers. I think
[25:09.060 --> 25:12.500]  that includes you. All of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out there. All of
[25:12.500 --> 25:16.100]  you podcast listeners. I do want to thank you once again for listening to episode
