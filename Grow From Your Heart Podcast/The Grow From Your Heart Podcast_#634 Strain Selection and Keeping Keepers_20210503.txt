[00:00.000 --> 00:07.280]  Yeah, welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:07.280 --> 00:13.200]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 634 of the Grow From Your
[00:13.200 --> 00:14.200]  Heart Podcast.
[00:14.200 --> 00:17.880]  In this episode, I'm going to focus on Patreon questions.
[00:17.880 --> 00:22.200]  Before we get there, let's do a few shoutouts to a few members of the 710 Club.
[00:22.200 --> 00:27.720]  Of course, the 710 Club are those folks who support us on Patreon at the $7.10 a month
[00:27.720 --> 00:28.720]  level or higher.
[00:28.720 --> 00:32.600]  So, with no further ado, let's start off with a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank
[00:32.600 --> 00:35.520]  you shoutout to my good friend, Jesse Grows.
[00:35.520 --> 00:39.000]  Let's follow that up with another big thank you shoutout to a good friend, Dave's Not
[00:39.000 --> 00:40.000]  Here.
[00:40.000 --> 00:42.560]  Let's send a big thank you shoutout to another long-time supporter.
[00:42.560 --> 00:46.280]  Let's send a special thank you shoutout to my friend, Nomi by my guacamole.
[00:46.280 --> 00:50.280]  Let's send a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shoutout to our buddy, Smokey J.
[00:50.280 --> 00:53.520]  Let's send a big fist bump to Evil Grow and Turt Burglar.
[00:53.520 --> 00:56.680]  Let's send a special thank you shoutout to Kojax and Chris J.
[00:56.760 --> 00:59.800]  Let's send a big thank you shoutout to Moon Rider and Brian P.
[00:59.800 --> 01:03.840]  And then let's wrap it all up with the big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shoutout
[01:03.840 --> 01:06.560]  to my friend, Brendan Grows.
[01:06.560 --> 01:11.440]  Big thanks and big shoutout to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:11.440 --> 01:15.000]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,

[01:28.160 --> 01:31.000]  nice and easy for all of my friends with their hands full.
[01:31.000 --> 01:34.560]  Maybe you're working, driving, dabbing, who knows what you're doing with your hands right
[01:34.560 --> 01:35.560]  now.
[01:35.560 --> 01:36.560]  I made it nice and easy.

[01:41.720 --> 01:42.720]  slash growfromyourheart.
[01:42.720 --> 01:48.520]  All right, it is time for the chattery part of the podcast here at the intro.
[01:48.520 --> 01:54.440]  I need to make sure everybody is aware that on May 22nd, iRegenetics will be participating
[01:54.440 --> 01:59.320]  in the Secret Stash Seed Exchange event in Denver, Colorado.
[01:59.320 --> 02:03.840]  That's right, 522 in Denver, Colorado at a secret location.
[02:03.840 --> 02:11.840]  Myself and other many well-known, well-respected vendors will be at the Secret Stash Seed Exchange
[02:11.840 --> 02:14.020]  in a secret location in Denver.
[02:14.020 --> 02:17.480]  If you'd like more info, if you'd like a link for tickets, if you'd like more details, you
[02:17.480 --> 02:21.920]  can send me an email or there will be a link in the show description and the video notes
[02:21.920 --> 02:24.520]  right next to the Patreon description or the Patreon link.
[02:24.520 --> 02:28.640]  There will be that link to the tickets, to details about the event.
[02:28.640 --> 02:30.160]  There may be a discount code.
[02:30.160 --> 02:33.520]  I'll put that discount code in the video description.
[02:33.520 --> 02:34.800]  Make sure you check that out.
[02:34.800 --> 02:36.560]  Come grab some packs of seeds.
[02:36.560 --> 02:37.560]  I will be there.
[02:37.560 --> 02:38.920]  Dungeon Vault will be there.
[02:38.920 --> 02:40.200]  Cap will be there.
[02:40.200 --> 02:42.360]  I think Top Dog will be there.
[02:42.360 --> 02:44.800]  I saw a lot of great names on the advertising.
[02:44.800 --> 02:48.680]  Come join us, Denver, May 22nd.
[02:48.680 --> 02:51.260]  Secret location, undisclosed location at this time.
[02:51.260 --> 02:52.260]  It will be a great place.
[02:52.260 --> 02:53.260]  It will be COVID safe.
[02:53.260 --> 02:56.720]  It will be COVID friendly, COVID restricted.
[02:56.720 --> 02:58.640]  It will be a good opportunity to come get some genetics.
[02:58.640 --> 03:00.280]  I didn't write a good commercial for that.
[03:00.280 --> 03:02.840]  I just wrote down the date, said that you should come.
[03:02.840 --> 03:04.760]  Come check us out, May 22nd in Denver.
[03:04.760 --> 03:08.640]  For more details, check the link in the video description or send me an email.
[03:08.640 --> 03:09.640]  GrowFromYourHeartAtHotMail.com.
[03:09.640 --> 03:10.880]  We'll get you set up.
[03:10.880 --> 03:13.280]  I'm going to turn down the music now.
[03:13.280 --> 03:18.080]  I want to send a very special, special Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[03:18.080 --> 03:19.080]  Thank you.
[03:19.080 --> 03:22.000]  A high five, a fist bump, a well wish.
[03:22.000 --> 03:23.280]  Just some good vibes and some love.
[03:23.280 --> 03:26.280]  Man, I want to send some love out to my friend, Jinx Proof.
[03:26.280 --> 03:31.160]  Jinx Proof is a fellow breeder, a fellow ganja warrior, a cannabis soldier.
[03:31.160 --> 03:35.080]  Jinx Proof has been experiencing, since I've known Jinx, he's had health issues.
[03:35.080 --> 03:37.320]  Jinx has been a health concern since I've met him.
[03:37.320 --> 03:38.320]  Big love, Jinx.
[03:38.320 --> 03:39.320]  I'm fucking with you.
[03:39.320 --> 03:43.120]  Jinx has had some sort of health problem always since I've known the dude.
[03:43.120 --> 03:46.640]  He recently experienced a heart attack and that scared the shit out of me.
[03:46.640 --> 03:50.280]  When your friends have a heart attack or something that concerns you, I saw it on social media.
[03:50.280 --> 03:52.480]  I didn't want to bombard the family and everything.
[03:52.480 --> 03:55.040]  They got enough people sending them love and shit, but I wanted to make sure to take a
[03:55.040 --> 04:01.120]  moment here on the show and send a big hug, a high five, a fist bump, a fucking dab, a
[04:01.120 --> 04:02.800]  bong rip.
[04:02.800 --> 04:06.680]  Send some energy out into the ethos, into the ether, into the whatever you want to call
[04:06.680 --> 04:07.680]  it.
[04:07.680 --> 04:10.040]  I'm going to stop there for my friend, Jinx Proof and Jinx's family.
[04:10.040 --> 04:11.600]  He's got a wonderful family.
[04:11.600 --> 04:13.200]  Shout out to Miss Rose for holding it down.
[04:13.200 --> 04:17.800]  We all think Jinx is the captain of that ship, but bro, we all know Miss Rose holds it down.
[04:17.800 --> 04:18.800]  Shout out, Miss Rose.
[04:18.800 --> 04:19.960]  Big salute to you.
[04:19.960 --> 04:23.880]  Big shout out to Jinxy Jr., but really big love to Jinx.
[04:23.880 --> 04:24.880]  Bro, I don't know.
[04:24.880 --> 04:28.240]  When you start thinking about your friends getting sick and having heart attacks and
[04:28.240 --> 04:32.140]  possibly potentially not being here, it makes you just want to go sit down and smoke one
[04:32.140 --> 04:36.440]  more joint with them, two more joints with them, hear a couple of more of their stories.
[04:36.440 --> 04:39.080]  I thought that it was possible that Jinx may not be around.
[04:39.080 --> 04:40.080]  It scared me.
[04:40.080 --> 04:41.640]  So Jinx, if you hear this, brother, I love you.
[04:41.640 --> 04:42.640]  Hope you're well, bro.
[04:42.640 --> 04:43.640]  Let's get together.
[04:43.640 --> 04:47.320]  Let's be COVID safe so we don't get you unhealthy again, but let's spend some time with the
[04:47.320 --> 04:48.320]  folks we love.
[04:48.320 --> 04:49.640]  Jinx is one of the folks we love.
[04:49.640 --> 04:50.640]  So shout out to Jinx.
[04:50.640 --> 04:55.680]  Once again, shout out to the entire Jinx Proof family, everybody that supports, loves, surrounds
[04:55.680 --> 04:56.680]  Jinx.
[04:56.680 --> 04:58.320]  If you're involved in that, big love, big respect to you.
[04:58.320 --> 05:00.640]  Let's send the whole family some love and some energy.
[05:00.640 --> 05:05.920]  Once again, big special fist bump to Miss Rose and a special fist bump to Jinxy Jr.
[05:05.920 --> 05:06.920]  Love the whole gang.
[05:06.920 --> 05:09.440]  All right, let's move forward.
[05:09.440 --> 05:15.000]  I've noticed something, you guys, in the podcast episodes that I put on YouTube, sometimes
[05:15.000 --> 05:17.200]  the text gets wonky.
[05:17.200 --> 05:19.240]  I put like, visit the website.
[05:19.240 --> 05:20.240]  I edit those shows.
[05:20.240 --> 05:23.680]  I make pretty damn good sure that the things are correct.
[05:23.680 --> 05:28.800]  I try real hard, but sometimes I've noticed that after the processing of the video, some
[05:28.800 --> 05:32.520]  things go weird in the video processing and they don't post the way that they looked on
[05:32.520 --> 05:34.560]  the screen originally.
[05:34.560 --> 05:38.400]  Thank you for letting me know that sometimes I post stuff like support us on Pat.
[05:38.400 --> 05:42.360]  I should say support us on Patreon, but I don't know what happened, dude.
[05:42.360 --> 05:46.160]  There was an update on Final Cut Pro and some shit got weird and they fixed it.
[05:46.160 --> 05:50.280]  I think there's been another update, so we'll see, but it looks good on the screen.
[05:50.280 --> 05:54.920]  When I type it in, I made sure like I double and triple edit and then I watch it back.
[05:54.920 --> 05:58.800]  And then when I put it up on YouTube, I guess it's happening when the file processes and
[05:58.800 --> 05:59.800]  compresses.
[05:59.800 --> 06:03.640]  Anyway, thank you to the people who told me that I put visit the web C. I don't know what
[06:03.640 --> 06:04.640]  a web C is.
[06:04.640 --> 06:07.680]  That's supposed to be a website, but apparently something in Final Cut Pro wanted to make
[06:07.680 --> 06:08.880]  a new word.
[06:08.880 --> 06:11.600]  So make sure you check out my web C. I read genetics.com.
[06:11.600 --> 06:16.080]  Anyway, thank you to my friends who gave me the, uh, I'm a fucking grammar Nazi, a grammar
[06:16.080 --> 06:17.080]  troll.
[06:17.080 --> 06:18.840]  So thank you for pointing out my errors and my mistakes.
[06:18.840 --> 06:20.960]  However, Final Cut Pro fucked me on that one.
[06:20.960 --> 06:22.080]  It was auto correct.
[06:22.080 --> 06:23.080]  Got me, bro.
[06:23.080 --> 06:24.080]  Anyway, thank you.
[06:24.080 --> 06:26.340]  I noticed stop sending me messages.
[06:26.340 --> 06:27.340]  Let's move forward.
[06:27.340 --> 06:30.480]  I do have Patreon questions, emails from our friends.
[06:30.480 --> 06:36.000]  Again, if you'd like to support the show on Patreon, all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com.
[06:36.000 --> 06:37.000]  Thank you for the support.
[06:37.000 --> 06:38.160]  I do appreciate it.
[06:38.160 --> 06:42.960]  This portion of the show is brought to you by our friend Brian C, a long time Patreon
[06:42.960 --> 06:44.080]  supporter.
[06:44.080 --> 06:47.320]  Also the number one Patreon supporter at this time.
[06:47.320 --> 06:51.640]  He has given us the most contributions and the longest standing supporter.
[06:51.640 --> 06:54.760]  So big thanks to our friend Brian C, much respect.
[06:54.760 --> 06:59.800]  This section is brought to you by Brian C. All right, we're moving into the Patreon portion
[06:59.800 --> 07:01.040]  of the show.
[07:01.040 --> 07:03.580]  This question came from my good friend, Billy Podunk.
[07:03.580 --> 07:07.040]  Before I read Billy Podunk's message, I want to give him some love as well.
[07:07.040 --> 07:09.160]  I know I'm filled with love in this episode.
[07:09.160 --> 07:10.560]  You can't go wrong when you're filled with love.
[07:10.560 --> 07:11.560]  That's a good thing.
[07:11.560 --> 07:14.000]  Grow from your heart, breed with love, spread love, spread the vibe.
[07:14.000 --> 07:19.080]  But what I'm talking about is Billy Podunk is a huge part of the IRIE army.
[07:19.080 --> 07:21.340]  He's always in the IRIE discord.
[07:21.340 --> 07:22.340]  He speaks well.
[07:22.340 --> 07:23.340]  He's kind to others.
[07:23.340 --> 07:24.600]  He's a good fucking dude.
[07:24.600 --> 07:25.600]  He's a good grower.
[07:25.600 --> 07:27.840]  He's passionate about what he does.
[07:27.840 --> 07:29.200]  I got a lot of respect for the dude.
[07:29.600 --> 07:31.720]  He obviously has a lot of respect for me.
[07:31.720 --> 07:36.080]  Without every member of the IRIE army, my army wouldn't exist.
[07:36.080 --> 07:37.400]  This wouldn't be what it is.
[07:37.400 --> 07:39.120]  I am enjoying life.
[07:39.120 --> 07:40.120]  I am ecstatic.
[07:40.120 --> 07:41.120]  I'm satisfied.
[07:41.120 --> 07:42.640]  I'm blessed with life.
[07:42.640 --> 07:47.400]  And without all of the army soldiers, this IRIE army wouldn't be what it is.
[07:47.400 --> 07:51.060]  Without the Grow From Your Heart podcast gang, I would just be some weirdo with a bunch of
[07:51.060 --> 07:52.060]  expensive toys.
[07:52.060 --> 07:55.680]  Fucking, I'd be Batman over here living a fantasy.
[07:55.680 --> 07:58.160]  But you guys make this fantasy a real thing.
[07:58.160 --> 07:59.520]  Billy Podunk is a big part of it.
[07:59.520 --> 08:00.520]  He's always there.
[08:00.520 --> 08:01.520]  He's always on the discord.
[08:01.520 --> 08:02.520]  He participates.
[08:02.520 --> 08:03.600]  He's a good dude.
[08:03.600 --> 08:04.720]  That shit means a lot to me.
[08:04.720 --> 08:06.680]  That loyalty, that friendship.
[08:06.680 --> 08:09.600]  It's not just a brand and consumers and customers, you guys.
[08:09.600 --> 08:10.800]  I've got a friendship with you guys.
[08:10.800 --> 08:12.000]  I've got a relationship with you guys.
[08:12.000 --> 08:16.160]  You rely on me to keep your gardens growing, to keep you stocked up with good seeds, to
[08:16.160 --> 08:19.920]  keep you educated, sometimes to tell you a stupid fucking joke, maybe sometimes even
[08:19.920 --> 08:21.500]  ruffle some feathers.
[08:21.500 --> 08:23.320]  You rely on me for that sort of shit.
[08:23.320 --> 08:26.720]  In turn, I can count on you guys to make sure that I am okay.
[08:26.720 --> 08:31.280]  My advice, my seeds, my product, it all makes sure that the bills are paid, the rent's paid,
[08:31.280 --> 08:33.280]  the lights are on, the mic is still hot.
[08:33.280 --> 08:34.400]  So it's a good relationship.
[08:34.400 --> 08:38.360]  And it feels good to know that you guys respect me, love me, trust me.
[08:38.360 --> 08:39.520]  I do it right back at you.
[08:39.520 --> 08:40.520]  I feel all sappy.
[08:40.520 --> 08:41.520]  I'm going to read this fucking message.
[08:41.520 --> 08:43.680]  Big shout out to all my friends who show me love.
[08:43.680 --> 08:45.600]  Filled with love today, you guys.
[08:45.600 --> 08:49.200]  Anyway, from Billy Podunk, it says, I do have a question.
[08:49.200 --> 08:52.240]  I have a pack of your Daybreaker F2s.
[08:52.240 --> 08:55.320]  So a while back, I made Daybreaker F2.
[08:55.320 --> 08:58.040]  Daybreaker is from Gage Green Genetics.
[08:58.040 --> 09:01.080]  Daybreaker is a cross of Chem D and Joseph OG.
[09:01.080 --> 09:04.200]  It's one of my favorite strains that I was gifted seeds of.
[09:04.200 --> 09:05.880]  I was given seeds of that a long time ago.
[09:05.880 --> 09:06.920]  I bred it.
[09:06.920 --> 09:10.080]  The Daybreaker is one of the parents of the Arise.
[09:10.080 --> 09:13.760]  Arise is one of my flagship, maybe famous strains, if you want to call it that.
[09:13.760 --> 09:15.560]  It tests real high in THC.
[09:15.560 --> 09:20.400]  Arise is a female golden goat pollinated by a male Daybreaker plant.
[09:20.400 --> 09:22.520]  I use the Daybreaker for a lot of reasons.
[09:22.520 --> 09:23.880]  I digress.
[09:23.880 --> 09:24.880]  Let's talk about this.
[09:25.440 --> 09:27.480]  You got a pack of your Daybreaker F2s.
[09:27.480 --> 09:30.280]  So I took a Daybreaker male and Daybreaker female.
[09:30.280 --> 09:32.440]  I let them pollinate each other.
[09:32.440 --> 09:34.080]  They were filled with love.
[09:34.080 --> 09:35.160]  And then we had seeds.
[09:35.160 --> 09:37.240]  Out of those seeds came some F2s.
[09:37.240 --> 09:40.240]  Those seeds were F2s, the second filial generation.
[09:40.240 --> 09:43.480]  I took some of those seeds and I passed them to some friends.
[09:43.480 --> 09:45.160]  Billy Podunk got some of these seeds.
[09:45.160 --> 09:47.740]  He got a five-pack of Daybreaker F2s.
[09:47.740 --> 09:52.880]  It says, I want to maintain this if it is something I really like, but that is not something
[09:52.880 --> 09:54.820]  I normally do.
[09:54.960 --> 10:00.660]  So Billy would like to preserve and maintain these Daybreaker F2s, but he's not normally
[10:00.660 --> 10:03.380]  a clone-cutting type of person.
[10:03.380 --> 10:09.740]  I do virtually no cloning, but I see that it is probably, I see that is probably, I
[10:09.740 --> 10:15.060]  get, okay, let me read that again because I do virtually no cloning, but I assume that
[10:15.060 --> 10:18.460]  it is probably what I will have to do as a part of this project.
[10:18.460 --> 10:21.620]  Sorry, I had to edit you a little bit there, but we made it make sense.
[10:21.620 --> 10:23.640]  Yeah, it's always good to know how to clone.
[10:24.560 --> 10:28.200]  You don't have to, but I recommend you get on top of your clone game.
[10:28.200 --> 10:33.320]  Learn how to clone in Rapid Rooters, in little like the tray, the Rapid Rooters and the Dome.
[10:33.320 --> 10:36.120]  That's the most affordable, cost-effective, simple way.
[10:36.120 --> 10:40.120]  If you want to spend some money on it, make it a science project, get yourself an EZCloner,
[10:40.120 --> 10:42.040]  a TurboCloner, an AeroCloner.
[10:42.040 --> 10:43.520]  They're all basically the same.
[10:43.520 --> 10:46.120]  Get a good quality product and you can do that.
[10:46.120 --> 10:49.120]  But I would recommend strongly that you learn to clone.
[10:49.120 --> 10:54.960]  What if you grow one of these Daybreaker F2s and it is the perfect medicine for you?
[10:54.960 --> 10:58.160]  What if it makes you feel perfect?
[10:58.160 --> 11:00.080]  What if it fixes all of your ailments?
[11:00.080 --> 11:01.840]  What if it makes everything that hurts not hurt?
[11:01.840 --> 11:03.400]  What if it makes all the sick not sick?
[11:03.400 --> 11:04.600]  What if it makes all the pain not pain?
[11:04.600 --> 11:05.760]  I think I said that.
[11:05.760 --> 11:07.800]  But what if this is the greatest herb you've ever smoked?
[11:07.800 --> 11:09.960]  You're really going to wish you had another clone of it because you're going to want to
[11:09.960 --> 11:13.560]  grow it, smoke it, and enjoy it and be pain-free again.
[11:13.560 --> 11:15.000]  So I recommend learning how to clone.
[11:15.000 --> 11:17.520]  That is something I recommend in the beginning.
[11:17.520 --> 11:20.360]  Once you get good at growing, the next thing you do is learn how to clone so you can grow
[11:20.360 --> 11:21.360]  again.
[11:21.360 --> 11:24.360]  But you're going to have to learn to do that.
[11:24.360 --> 11:28.480]  It says, I'm also open to making seeds, but I have not done that intentionally before,
[11:28.480 --> 11:32.320]  which makes me think maybe before, bro, you may have made some accidental seeds.
[11:32.320 --> 11:35.920]  I will be growing these in cocoa using your feed schedule.
[11:35.920 --> 11:38.040]  What is your recommended approach to this product?
[11:38.040 --> 11:42.560]  Ultimately, I think I will want to use these to make seeds at some point as I want to avoid
[11:42.560 --> 11:47.400]  using mother plants for as long as it will cut into my six plant limit.
[11:47.480 --> 11:50.440]  We can talk about that for a minute too.
[11:50.440 --> 11:54.320]  Once you find the keeper, the way I would go about this is I would grow the five plants
[11:54.320 --> 11:58.120]  and find the keeper out of there, find the male and the female because you might want
[11:58.120 --> 12:02.040]  to breed with these, but definitely find the male keeper out of there, learn how to clone
[12:02.040 --> 12:03.040]  it.
[12:03.040 --> 12:05.960]  Then you've only got one plant working as your mother plant.
[12:05.960 --> 12:08.320]  You can cut, let's see, you got six plants.
[12:08.320 --> 12:12.600]  What I would do is I would have a four or five plant perpetual growth where you've got
[12:12.600 --> 12:14.480]  one mother plant per se.
[12:14.480 --> 12:20.160]  You're taking clones off of that every two, three, four weeks, however you set your rhythm,
[12:20.160 --> 12:23.680]  and then put a plant in the veg room every two weeks.
[12:23.680 --> 12:27.280]  Let it veg for however long your cycle, we'll set up a cycle, you know what I mean?
[12:27.280 --> 12:31.480]  That fits around your six plants and your size of your space is really going to be key,
[12:31.480 --> 12:35.240]  but always have plants in rotations where one is two weeks in, one's four weeks in,
[12:35.240 --> 12:39.220]  one is six weeks in, one is eight weeks in, and one gets chopped down to day.
[12:39.220 --> 12:40.220]  You could set that up.
[12:40.220 --> 12:43.780]  One mother plant and five perpetual plants, you could make that happen.
[12:43.780 --> 12:46.680]  Cut down four plants, have one in veg at all times.
[12:46.680 --> 12:50.640]  You could set up that rhythm if you put some strategy and thought into it.
[12:50.640 --> 12:54.360]  You got 70 day cycles divided by how many numbers of plants.
[12:54.360 --> 12:55.360]  There you go.
[12:55.360 --> 12:56.740]  That's how many days apart your cycle should be.
[12:56.740 --> 12:58.280]  How long do you need to veg?
[12:58.280 --> 13:03.320]  It's really just a math equation where X equals how long do I veg, Y equals how many plants,
[13:03.320 --> 13:05.240]  just do an equation, figure it out.
[13:05.240 --> 13:08.000]  But that's how you work around the mother plant and the low count.
[13:08.000 --> 13:11.160]  Or use that veg plant for a mother plant at the same time.
[13:11.160 --> 13:16.020]  While it's vegging, it's growing, it's growing, cut the top off of it, get the top cloning.
[13:16.020 --> 13:20.300]  As soon as that top makes roots, that plant has recovered by then from the top and you
[13:20.300 --> 13:21.700]  can put that into flower.
[13:21.700 --> 13:22.700]  Repeat that process.
[13:22.700 --> 13:25.920]  Grow that next bitch out real big, top it, move it into flower.
[13:25.920 --> 13:27.660]  Grow that top out, move it, put it into flower.
[13:27.660 --> 13:28.740]  You can keep doing that.
[13:28.740 --> 13:30.980]  Not have to waste a mother plant space.
[13:30.980 --> 13:31.980]  All right.
[13:31.980 --> 13:34.300]  I said real quick on that one, so let me get back on track.
[13:34.300 --> 13:39.540]  If I'm going to make seeds after going through what I have with these plants, is it possible
[13:39.540 --> 13:41.080]  or worthwhile to make some smaller plants?
[13:41.080 --> 13:42.080]  All right.
[13:42.080 --> 13:43.280]  Let's not talk about that yet.
[13:43.280 --> 13:45.240]  My recommended approach.
[13:45.240 --> 13:49.200]  The recommended approach honestly is learn how to make clones, find a keeper and keep
[13:49.200 --> 13:53.700]  the best female out of here and turn that into like a production female and make that
[13:53.700 --> 13:55.880]  happen so you can grow that forever and ever.
[13:55.880 --> 13:57.820]  However, you may want to preserve this.
[13:57.820 --> 14:01.320]  We talked in a previous episode about preservation.
[14:01.320 --> 14:05.960]  Then I would say find a male plant in this pack of seeds.
[14:05.960 --> 14:07.240]  You've only got five to work with.
[14:07.340 --> 14:09.940]  You're going to find two, maybe three males.
[14:09.940 --> 14:15.380]  Find the male that is short, squatty, doesn't flower too quickly and smells like puke and
[14:15.380 --> 14:17.220]  mothballs is the one I would go for.
[14:17.220 --> 14:18.420]  Find that male.
[14:18.420 --> 14:20.760]  Find the girl that looks like what you want.
[14:20.760 --> 14:23.700]  Find the girl of your choice out of this pack of seeds.
[14:23.700 --> 14:25.620]  Pollinate the two, pull the seeds out of there.
[14:25.620 --> 14:27.500]  Then you've got a bunch of seeds.
[14:27.500 --> 14:32.340]  That would be the quick, easy way to go about making more seeds and preserving it, breeding
[14:32.340 --> 14:34.100]  it to get more seeds.
[14:34.160 --> 14:37.200]  Now while you're making F3 and you're going to narrow down the traits that you're looking
[14:37.200 --> 14:43.400]  for, honestly, learn how to clone is the way that you should go about this.
[14:43.400 --> 14:44.840]  I can't say should.
[14:44.840 --> 14:47.720]  I shouldn't should on you, but it's what I would do.
[14:47.720 --> 14:50.920]  If you want to be a great grower and have this genetic around forever, cloning is the
[14:50.920 --> 14:51.920]  way to do it.
[14:51.920 --> 14:55.380]  We talked in the previous episode about making feminized seeds as well.
[14:55.380 --> 14:59.960]  If you find that female that you really like, you can use the advice from the last episode
[14:59.960 --> 15:03.960]  to definitely make feminized seeds for preservation of this.
[15:03.980 --> 15:06.700]  Now, there are more parts to this question I want to talk about.
[15:06.700 --> 15:11.260]  If I'm going to make seeds after going through what I have with these plants, is it possible
[15:11.260 --> 15:16.220]  or worthwhile to make some smaller plants with a shortened veg period?
[15:16.220 --> 15:18.500]  Will that provide me with a decent amount of seeds?
[15:18.500 --> 15:19.500]  All right.
[15:19.500 --> 15:23.020]  The shorter veg period, veg period's up to you.
[15:23.020 --> 15:27.180]  If you want something more vigorous, you just have to breed things that are more vigorous.
[15:27.180 --> 15:31.220]  Find one that veggies with hyper vigor and breed to that.
[15:31.220 --> 15:33.160]  That's how you breed for the traits that you want.
[15:33.160 --> 15:34.860]  Quicker veg, quicker flower.
[15:34.860 --> 15:38.700]  Find plants that veg quickly, flower quickly, and breed to those.
[15:38.700 --> 15:40.860]  That is how to put that trait in the mix.
[15:40.860 --> 15:45.260]  Then you'll make seeds, find the next generation, find the seed in that batch that does what
[15:45.260 --> 15:46.740]  you want, keep breeding.
[15:46.740 --> 15:49.220]  You'll isolate that trait, dial in that trait.
[15:49.220 --> 15:51.940]  That's how you get to quicker vegging, quicker breeding.
[15:51.940 --> 15:54.300]  It's find the plant that does it and breed to it.
[15:54.300 --> 15:57.160]  Will that provide me with a decent amount of seeds?
[15:57.160 --> 16:00.740]  You can make a lot of seeds off of a small plant.
[16:00.740 --> 16:01.740]  Yes.
[16:01.740 --> 16:05.880]  A one gallon pot with a female plant that is pollinated at the right time will net you
[16:05.880 --> 16:08.360]  plenty of seeds to play with for the rest of your life.
[16:08.360 --> 16:12.600]  If you don't want to sell them, you'll have plenty of seeds.
[16:12.600 --> 16:15.880]  Do you have any pointers on these plants as well as what you might think would come out
[16:15.880 --> 16:17.880]  of the F3 generation?
[16:17.880 --> 16:21.260]  I'm in the process of planning this project and I want to make sure I'm in a position
[16:21.260 --> 16:22.920]  to take advantage of these beans.
[16:22.920 --> 16:26.720]  I really appreciate the forethought and preparation into a pack of seeds.
[16:26.720 --> 16:30.320]  Most people, they buy seeds and they start growing them.
[16:30.320 --> 16:33.980]  Once they're in a cup and falling over, then they get a book and start asking how to grow.
[16:33.980 --> 16:34.980]  This is great.
[16:34.980 --> 16:38.820]  Shout out to Billy Podunk for having some forethought here.
[16:38.820 --> 16:41.340]  Any pointers on what I think would come out of the F3?
[16:41.340 --> 16:45.900]  If you breed with a big wide leafed female and a short stocky male and they both have
[16:45.900 --> 16:52.460]  that burnt rubber, tennis balls, vomit, kind of a mothball sort of aroma and flavor, you'll
[16:52.460 --> 16:57.980]  make a beautiful OG Kush cross that is short, squatty.
[16:58.040 --> 17:01.240]  If you get the right male that flowers in the right time and the right female that flowers
[17:01.240 --> 17:06.360]  in the right time, you could bring these down to nine weeks and have a solid nine week finisher,
[17:06.360 --> 17:11.880]  rock hard dense buds that smell like feet and fuel and just this nasty bar puke trash
[17:11.880 --> 17:12.960]  can sort of thing.
[17:12.960 --> 17:15.000]  That's what I would expect from it.
[17:15.000 --> 17:18.000]  Super potent, put you in the couch, sit you on your ass.
[17:18.000 --> 17:21.300]  That's what I would expect from it, honestly, if you do it right.
[17:21.300 --> 17:22.780]  It's all about selection though.
[17:22.780 --> 17:25.960]  You could pick totally different plants than me and come out with a completely different
[17:25.960 --> 17:27.240]  outcome.
[17:27.260 --> 17:29.140]  It's all about that selection.
[17:29.140 --> 17:31.060]  I hope that's a real solid answer on that.
[17:31.060 --> 17:33.780]  I'm going to skim this, make sure I gave you an answer.
[17:33.780 --> 17:35.540]  First part, learn how to clone, bro.
[17:35.540 --> 17:42.360]  The second part, find a male, pollinate a female, make seeds or run a perpetual grow
[17:42.360 --> 17:46.020]  where you're using the mother plant as the veg plant at the same time.
[17:46.020 --> 17:47.980]  That's another way to do it.
[17:47.980 --> 17:50.660]  Pointers for the F3, that's all about selection.
[17:50.660 --> 17:54.780]  Short squatty plants with big leaves is what I would go for in this cross.
[17:54.780 --> 17:55.780]  A lot of seeds.
[17:55.780 --> 17:57.020]  You can make a lot of seeds in small plants.
[17:57.800 --> 18:00.300]  I also want to say that I greatly appreciate your Discord community.
[18:00.300 --> 18:03.100]  It's quickly become a big part of my life every day.
[18:03.100 --> 18:04.100]  Yes, I know, bro.
[18:04.100 --> 18:05.100]  I'm a lurker.
[18:05.100 --> 18:09.740]  I don't participate in the Discord a lot because I've got a lot going on, but I see you there
[18:09.740 --> 18:10.980]  every time I log in.
[18:10.980 --> 18:15.440]  If I go to check an auction on Dave's, shout out to Dave for doing auctions on Discord.
[18:15.440 --> 18:18.260]  Make sure you check out Dave's auctions on the Discord channel.
[18:18.260 --> 18:21.080]  There will be a link to the Discord channel in the description.
[18:21.080 --> 18:24.940]  But every time I go look, our buddy Billy Podunk is there just hanging out, having a
[18:24.940 --> 18:26.900]  great conversation.
[18:26.900 --> 18:27.900]  So thank you, bro.
[18:27.900 --> 18:28.900]  I do appreciate that.
[18:28.900 --> 18:32.820]  I thought it was really great for Graybeard to get some recognition for managing such
[18:32.820 --> 18:34.660]  a positive and productive community.
[18:34.660 --> 18:36.540]  Yes, Graybeard got a shout out.
[18:36.540 --> 18:40.680]  Also Graybeard, check your mailbox, bro, because you did get an Irie gift.
[18:40.680 --> 18:42.060]  So you got something coming to you.
[18:42.060 --> 18:44.620]  I want to make sure to take care of our friends.
[18:44.620 --> 18:49.340]  On one last note, I've been mildly obsessing over one of your discontinued strains.
[18:49.340 --> 18:53.220]  I wonder if there is a place I might score some Dubwise seeds.
[18:53.220 --> 18:56.340]  Thanks again and keep up the incredible work from Billy Podunk.
[18:56.340 --> 19:02.140]  Unfortunately, our friend Billy Podunk Dubwise is forever discontinued.
[19:02.140 --> 19:03.940]  I will check my personal vault.
[19:03.940 --> 19:06.500]  You may have to send me a message to give me a bump and remind me.
[19:06.500 --> 19:07.500]  I'll check the vault.
[19:07.500 --> 19:11.100]  Honestly, bro, I don't think there's any left even in my personal vault.
[19:11.100 --> 19:12.380]  That was a hot seller.
[19:12.380 --> 19:13.380]  I was a femme.
[19:13.380 --> 19:15.940]  I don't think I kept any.
[19:15.940 --> 19:18.180]  I'm not much for hoarding lately, the seeds.
[19:18.180 --> 19:19.220]  I've been trying to get them out.
[19:19.220 --> 19:22.140]  If I realize I'm not going to grow those, I get them out to the people to grow them.
[19:22.140 --> 19:23.420]  If I've got them, bro, they're yours.
[19:23.420 --> 19:24.780]  I'll send you a pack of them.
[19:24.780 --> 19:25.780]  Remind me.
[19:25.780 --> 19:27.700]  Don't let me forget.
[19:27.700 --> 19:29.300]  I'm reading the notes that I sent.
[19:29.300 --> 19:31.140]  Yeah, I told him in the, I replied to him.
[19:31.140 --> 19:32.140]  I'm reading the reply.
[19:32.140 --> 19:36.940]  It says, sorry to break your heart, but Dub is forever put to rest.
[19:36.940 --> 19:40.700]  So if I find any dude when I'm digging through my stash, I'll hook you up.
[19:40.700 --> 19:44.140]  All right, I'm going to move on to the next question.
[19:44.140 --> 19:47.340]  Recently I talked about auto watering and somebody asked me for more details on auto
[19:47.340 --> 19:48.340]  watering.
[19:48.340 --> 19:49.620]  I realized I left something out.
[19:49.620 --> 19:53.420]  So we're going to read this message and talk briefly, real briefly about it.
[19:53.420 --> 19:55.340]  Let me make sure not to read too much of this.
[19:55.900 --> 19:57.820]  Hey, Ross to Jeff, feel free to use my name.
[19:57.820 --> 20:00.100]  Shout out to our friend stash drop.
[20:00.100 --> 20:01.100]  Nothing extra needed.
[20:01.100 --> 20:03.980]  Anyway, thanks and much love for what you do and for the community.
[20:03.980 --> 20:06.220]  I'm glad to be able to kick back to you.
[20:06.220 --> 20:11.140]  I've learned so much in my grow has made tremendous gains since becoming a faithful listener.
[20:11.140 --> 20:12.140]  Bro, thank you.
[20:12.140 --> 20:13.500]  I appreciate that.
[20:13.500 --> 20:15.260]  Also a quick shout out to white Mike.
[20:15.260 --> 20:19.500]  Some of my favorite podcasts are when you guys are together and keep on killing it.
[20:19.500 --> 20:20.500]  Thank you.
[20:20.500 --> 20:21.500]  I do appreciate that.
[20:21.500 --> 20:24.180]  Mike will hear this big shout out to cracker Mike.
[20:24.180 --> 20:28.220]  So my question, and you can use this on the show or not, bro, it's on the show.
[20:28.220 --> 20:29.500]  Here we go.
[20:29.500 --> 20:33.860]  What watering system do you use or have you use, or can you recommend, or do you just
[20:33.860 --> 20:35.140]  build your own setups?
[20:35.140 --> 20:37.780]  I'm pretty handy, but also a visual guy.
[20:37.780 --> 20:38.780]  That's the point of right there.
[20:38.780 --> 20:39.780]  So let's talk about that.
[20:39.780 --> 20:44.660]  He also said just to add, I'm looking for a little more automation, watering, feeding.
[20:44.660 --> 20:46.380]  He says I'm here to hand feed, but I'd love to.
[20:46.380 --> 20:47.380]  So yeah, that makes sense, bro.
[20:47.380 --> 20:48.380]  I get it.
[20:48.380 --> 20:49.380]  You're there to hand feed.
[20:49.380 --> 20:53.620]  But if we could automate feeding and focus on cracking, twisting, popping, lollipopping,
[20:53.620 --> 20:55.540]  defoliating, scouting for bugs.
[20:55.540 --> 20:59.100]  Yeah, we could just do more shit if we have machines doing other shit.
[20:59.100 --> 21:01.180]  I get it.
[21:01.180 --> 21:04.860]  So let's talk about what I missed in a previous episode, talking about auto watering.
[21:04.860 --> 21:07.860]  And I did recap on this just a little bit.
[21:07.860 --> 21:13.700]  If you want to provide a really simple solution for auto watering, you can build a really
[21:13.700 --> 21:14.980]  easy auto watering system.
[21:14.980 --> 21:16.740]  I talked about that in a previous episode.
[21:16.740 --> 21:21.400]  You got a pump, you got some tubing that goes to basically a homemade manifold, which goes
[21:21.400 --> 21:24.480]  to spaghetti line, which goes to emitters, which goes to the pots.
[21:24.480 --> 21:27.200]  You put that on a timer, ding, ding, water the plants.
[21:27.200 --> 21:30.080]  It's pretty easy if you're a handy dude, you can knock that out, no problem.
[21:30.080 --> 21:35.120]  If you're not the super handiest construction worthy, maybe if you're accident prone, maybe
[21:35.120 --> 21:39.200]  if you're like me and you know that there's a company out there that spent a lot of time
[21:39.200 --> 21:43.540]  making a product, researching it, developing it, finding the fucking mistakes and flaws
[21:43.540 --> 21:44.540]  and getting it perfect.
[21:44.540 --> 21:48.040]  And before they sold it to us, that's what I'd rather do than fuck around and try to
[21:48.040 --> 21:49.120]  build my own product.
[21:49.120 --> 21:50.120]  I make seeds.
[21:50.120 --> 21:51.120]  I do podcasts.
[21:51.840 --> 21:52.840]  I make rums.
[21:52.840 --> 21:53.840]  I'm good at that.
[21:53.840 --> 21:55.480]  I'm not good at making auto watering systems for my home grow.
[21:55.480 --> 21:56.720]  I can do it, but I'm not.
[21:56.720 --> 21:58.120]  There are other people that can do that.
[21:58.120 --> 22:02.440]  So that's when I would go with the product like an auto pot system.
[22:02.440 --> 22:06.200]  Auto pots are a great system for somebody who wants to just provide themselves with
[22:06.200 --> 22:08.160]  a quick auto watering system.
[22:08.160 --> 22:12.120]  Auto pots, hempy buckets, something like that are wonderful for you.
[22:12.120 --> 22:13.120]  So that's what I would recommend.
[22:13.120 --> 22:15.680]  Shout out to our friends at Auto Pot USA.
[22:15.680 --> 22:16.680]  Give them a checkout.
[22:16.680 --> 22:17.680]  They don't sponsor the show.
[22:17.680 --> 22:18.680]  They are friends of mine.
[22:18.680 --> 22:22.720]  I'm not even using the products right now, but I've been really thinking about it and
[22:22.720 --> 22:27.760]  really considering putting one room on auto pots and seeing if I enjoy it because the
[22:27.760 --> 22:32.720]  summer is coming and after a COVID summer, this summer I'm not sitting around all year.
[22:32.720 --> 22:33.720]  We're going to go do some shit.
[22:33.720 --> 22:35.760]  I don't want to be here watering all the time.
[22:35.760 --> 22:38.840]  So some auto pots where I could get away would be awesome.
[22:38.840 --> 22:43.800]  Now that I've recommended the auto pots, something I must say, auto pots are fucking awesome
[22:43.800 --> 22:46.240]  until you knock over that reservoir.
[22:46.240 --> 22:47.480]  Don't knock over the reservoir.
[22:47.480 --> 22:48.720]  Keep that thing full.
[22:48.720 --> 22:49.720]  Keep it nutriented.
[22:49.720 --> 22:50.720]  Keep it pH balanced.
[22:50.720 --> 22:54.360]  Maybe stir it, but don't knock it over because that's the only time I've seen something go
[22:54.360 --> 22:56.080]  wrong with the auto pot system.
[22:56.080 --> 22:57.280]  We had a friend knock over that thing.
[22:57.280 --> 22:58.280]  You know who you are, bro.
[22:58.280 --> 22:59.280]  Big shout out.
[22:59.280 --> 23:02.920]  I'm not going to say your name, but don't knock that fucker over.
[23:02.920 --> 23:07.420]  Once again, they don't pay me to say that, but the auto pot system has been looking like
[23:07.420 --> 23:09.120]  a great product to me.
[23:09.120 --> 23:12.840]  Auto pots, hempy buckets, some sort of sip system is really easy.
[23:12.840 --> 23:14.800]  It comes with all the shit in the box.
[23:14.800 --> 23:19.520]  Also if you really insist on building an irrigation system, they do make some pre-designed
[23:19.520 --> 23:20.680]  irrigation systems.
[23:20.680 --> 23:25.000]  You can find them at your big box hardware stores locally, or if you're smart enough,
[23:25.000 --> 23:27.880]  you can just reverse engineer that, build it for everything you need.
[23:27.880 --> 23:33.240]  Again, my advice, I say this every time we talk about auto watering systems, buy a second
[23:33.240 --> 23:34.240]  pump.
[23:34.240 --> 23:38.220]  If you plan on auto watering and that's your reliable system, buy a second pump.
[23:38.220 --> 23:42.200]  Quite often that pump will die unexpectedly without warning.
[23:42.200 --> 23:47.920]  It goes pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, and then it makes this noise.
[23:47.920 --> 23:48.920]  And you're fucked.
[23:48.920 --> 23:49.920]  It doesn't warn you.
[23:49.920 --> 23:50.920]  It just dies.
[23:50.920 --> 23:51.920]  They're done.
[23:51.920 --> 23:53.000]  So they seize up and they're over.
[23:53.000 --> 23:58.240]  Get a backup because you don't want to be watering and have, it's not the end of work
[23:58.240 --> 23:59.240]  bell.
[23:59.240 --> 24:00.240]  That's the you're fucked today bell.
[24:00.240 --> 24:02.440]  So get a backup pump, have that on hand.
[24:02.440 --> 24:04.480]  They're like a hundred bucks at the most.
[24:04.480 --> 24:07.680]  I know sometimes you don't have a hundred bucks, but it's going to help you out.
[24:07.680 --> 24:08.680]  You'll have to auto water.
[24:08.680 --> 24:10.760]  You have to hand water if you fuck it up.
[24:10.760 --> 24:14.360]  I'm rambling, but I do have one more message for you.
[24:14.360 --> 24:17.160]  This one, do they want their name said, I don't know if this person wants their name
[24:17.160 --> 24:19.840]  said, so we're going to skip that just to be safe.
[24:19.840 --> 24:25.440]  It says, Jeff, I live where our longest day is only 13 hours long.
[24:25.440 --> 24:27.800]  I already know where this is going.
[24:27.800 --> 24:32.520]  Which of your strains would you would do okay with those shorter days?
[24:32.520 --> 24:36.440]  I'm worried that a lot of stuff will sprout and almost immediately go into flower.
[24:36.440 --> 24:38.560]  Yes, you are accurate.
[24:38.560 --> 24:43.320]  To be quite honest with you, a hundred percent honest and fucking not lie to you at all.
[24:43.320 --> 24:46.160]  As a seed breeder, I'd like to tell you I got some shit that's going to work perfectly
[24:46.160 --> 24:48.360]  for you, but I do not.
[24:48.360 --> 24:52.560]  I breed and we're playing with these words, sativa and Indica and all that shit.
[24:52.560 --> 24:59.120]  Now I breed sativa dominant thin leaf drug type cultivars that will flower very quickly
[24:59.120 --> 25:00.780]  in your conditions.
[25:00.780 --> 25:04.520]  Most of what I breed, it will go into flower and that you need something more Indica like
[25:04.520 --> 25:07.720]  more broad leaf, more mellowed out kind of stuff.
[25:07.880 --> 25:09.080]  My shit's not going to do that for you.
[25:09.080 --> 25:13.800]  My stuff will flower very, very quickly to be quite honest with you.
[25:13.800 --> 25:18.440]  It says I sure would love to run a morning dew and he said my favorite song shout out
[25:18.440 --> 25:19.440]  to a fellow deadhead.
[25:19.440 --> 25:24.320]  Hey now, they said I'd love to run morning dew, orange chasm, blue raspberry truffle
[25:24.320 --> 25:28.080]  or grateful dog, which is also a grateful dead reference if you're paying attention,
[25:28.080 --> 25:33.880]  but I'll go with whichever one will grow with more equatorial type of light cycle.
[25:33.880 --> 25:34.880]  Thanks brother.
[25:35.040 --> 25:39.440]  Um, yeah, I wish I could sell you some seeds, bro, but I don't want to lie to you.
[25:39.440 --> 25:41.000]  I've got a reputation to keep.
[25:41.000 --> 25:42.000]  I've got a friend to keep.
[25:42.000 --> 25:43.520]  I've got a patron to keep here.
[25:43.520 --> 25:48.040]  Um, I got a business to manage and I'm more about keeping you guys as my friends and being
[25:48.040 --> 25:49.160]  fucking honest with you.
[25:49.160 --> 25:51.240]  That's working really well for me.
[25:51.240 --> 25:55.520]  Uh, I can lose out on a seed sale and tell you that I probably don't have what you want.
[25:55.520 --> 25:56.940]  That's quite honest.
[25:56.940 --> 26:00.680]  You could buy some stuff, but keep it indoors until it's time to flower.
[26:00.680 --> 26:03.000]  Like keep it indoors under grow lights, get it big.
[26:03.000 --> 26:05.440]  And then when you're ready to flip it, then go put it outside.
[26:05.440 --> 26:06.440]  That's what I would do.
[26:06.440 --> 26:09.320]  But honestly, bro, I don't have the product for you.
[26:09.320 --> 26:10.840]  I'm not even trying to be that guy.
[26:10.840 --> 26:13.040]  Uh, but I don't want to rip you off.
[26:13.040 --> 26:14.680]  Uh, you're looking for Ferraris bro.
[26:14.680 --> 26:17.160]  And I sell Volkswagen's which may be related somewhere.
[26:17.160 --> 26:18.160]  I don't know.
[26:18.160 --> 26:19.160]  I'm not a car guy.
[26:19.160 --> 26:23.080]  That was a bad analogy, but most of what I've got is going to flower pretty quickly outside.
[26:23.080 --> 26:24.080]  It likes a lot of light.
[26:24.080 --> 26:27.200]  Uh, as soon as, as soon as you get out there, it'll probably flip.
[26:27.200 --> 26:29.680]  So my advice would be to get something, veg it indoors.
[26:29.680 --> 26:31.160]  It's kind of late for that now.
[26:31.160 --> 26:34.560]  Um, then put it out there when you're ready to flip it, but it sounds like you could probably
[26:34.560 --> 26:40.240]  get, uh, if you got, I've never, I've never said this, bro, but you need auto flowers.
[26:40.240 --> 26:44.080]  I would run, you don't need, I would recommend, I would recommend three runs of auto flowers
[26:44.080 --> 26:45.080]  in a summer.
[26:45.080 --> 26:48.960]  Uh, if your days are that short, you could probably bust out three runs of auto flowers.
[26:48.960 --> 26:50.240]  Just put them out there and get them going.
[26:50.240 --> 26:53.240]  Uh, you could probably do it at least two runs of autos here.
[26:53.240 --> 26:55.840]  You guys is a good situation where auto flowers come into play.
[26:55.840 --> 26:57.160]  I talk a lot of shit about autos.
[26:57.160 --> 26:58.360]  I'm not a fan of them.
[26:58.360 --> 26:59.560]  I think they are.
[26:59.640 --> 27:01.520]  Um, it's not that they're inferior.
[27:01.520 --> 27:05.360]  I'd rather be able to veg and manipulate my plants through their veg cycle for a commercial
[27:05.360 --> 27:08.800]  production and get what I want and then flower them when I'm ready here.
[27:08.800 --> 27:10.880]  We've got plants that are going to flip on their own anyway.
[27:10.880 --> 27:13.440]  So let's just put auto flowers out there and maybe that's what you want.
[27:13.440 --> 27:14.800]  I'm not an auto flower guy.
[27:14.800 --> 27:18.200]  Maybe the short flowering cycle, but you could pull more of them is what I'm thinking.
[27:18.200 --> 27:19.680]  You can get like three cycles.
[27:19.680 --> 27:23.840]  Um, you can get two cycles of regular cannabis also out there probably.
[27:23.840 --> 27:28.800]  But honestly, dude, this, uh, my products aren't going to be the best products for you.
[27:28.800 --> 27:33.360]  So maybe try the, uh, the flow of the Prana, the Prana may be the one that would work out
[27:33.360 --> 27:37.720]  there for you, but I really don't want to lie to you, rip you off, take your money.
[27:37.720 --> 27:40.240]  And then you think those plants are going to do well and they go into flower and you
[27:40.240 --> 27:42.040]  call me and you're like, Hey, dreadlock, fuck you.
[27:42.040 --> 27:43.040]  I don't need that.
[27:43.040 --> 27:45.480]  So, um, yeah, straight up.
[27:45.480 --> 27:47.400]  Honesty is the best policy right here.
[27:47.400 --> 27:48.400]  There is more.
[27:48.400 --> 27:51.520]  If you happen to mention me or my question, this is what we need.
[27:51.520 --> 27:58.520]  Please mention D T O M four 20 is my username on a lot of forums and I G.
[27:58.520 --> 28:00.720]  So it's don't tread on me for 20.
[28:00.720 --> 28:01.720]  Don't tread on me.
[28:01.720 --> 28:05.360]  Um, shout out to our friend D T O M four 20 for the great question.
[28:05.360 --> 28:10.520]  Uh, and then it says, I, Oh, I replied with, I think most of my stuff will flip early on
[28:10.520 --> 28:11.520]  you.
[28:11.520 --> 28:14.520]  Maybe try sun kiss or Prana.
[28:14.520 --> 28:15.680]  So that was my recommendation.
[28:15.680 --> 28:18.400]  My advice, you guys, I could have recommended anything.
[28:18.400 --> 28:22.120]  I actually recommended auto flowers, which is weird, uh, just because they're still going
[28:22.120 --> 28:25.760]  to flower early on you, but, but you'll be able to get more crops.
[28:25.760 --> 28:28.200]  I think if you're just pulling auto flowers, you can put them out there and they'll flip
[28:28.880 --> 28:29.880]  right away and you pull more.
[28:29.880 --> 28:30.880]  I don't know.
[28:30.880 --> 28:31.880]  That may be terrible advice.
[28:31.880 --> 28:33.360]  Um, I'm not an outdoor grower.
[28:33.360 --> 28:34.840]  I'm not an auto flower guy.
[28:34.840 --> 28:36.560]  I'm just guessing that maybe you could pull more.
[28:36.560 --> 28:38.960]  There's a reason why people do the autos outdoors.
[28:38.960 --> 28:40.920]  I may have just talked out of my ass on that one.
[28:40.920 --> 28:44.320]  Uh, take my advice with a grain of salt on that, but I was honest with you.
[28:44.320 --> 28:45.480]  I don't have the product for you.
[28:45.480 --> 28:46.480]  Tried to find a solution.
[28:46.480 --> 28:48.240]  You guys, I'm fucking high and rambly.
[28:48.240 --> 28:49.880]  It is time to wrap up this podcast.
[28:49.880 --> 28:51.280]  I want to thank you for hanging out with me.
[28:51.280 --> 28:55.480]  Thank you for joining me for episode 634 of the grow from your heart podcast.
[28:55.480 --> 28:56.480]  I had a great time.
[28:56.480 --> 28:57.960]  Hope you had a great time as well.
[28:58.000 --> 29:01.600]  If you feel like the episode was educational, informative, or entertaining, maybe you'd
[29:01.600 --> 29:03.840]  like to throw me a couple of bucks cause I made you a chuckle.
[29:03.840 --> 29:05.440]  Maybe you learned something today.
[29:05.440 --> 29:06.960]  Maybe you just got too much money in your pocket.
[29:06.960 --> 29:08.040]  You want to spread some love.
[29:08.040 --> 29:12.680]  My Patreon is patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[29:12.680 --> 29:13.680]  Don't be shy.
[29:13.680 --> 29:14.680]  I'd love the support.
[29:14.680 --> 29:17.520]  Also, if you can't support the show, keep listening.
[29:17.520 --> 29:18.960]  All you have to do is listen.
[29:18.960 --> 29:22.240]  All of your clicks on YouTube, all of your clicks on wherever you're listening, that
[29:22.240 --> 29:23.240]  counts.
[29:23.240 --> 29:24.240]  That means a lot to me.
[29:24.240 --> 29:25.700]  Maybe tell a friend about the podcast.
[29:25.700 --> 29:26.700]  Do what you can.
[29:26.700 --> 29:27.700]  I get it.
[29:27.940 --> 29:28.940]  It's a hard time.
[29:28.940 --> 29:29.940]  It's a pandemic.
[29:29.940 --> 29:30.940]  People lost their jobs.
[29:30.940 --> 29:31.940]  Shit went weird.
[29:31.940 --> 29:32.940]  We don't all have a dollar to support a podcast.
[29:32.940 --> 29:33.940]  I appreciate you.
[29:33.940 --> 29:36.660]  I respect you and I love you just the same.
[29:36.660 --> 29:38.420]  Thank you for listening.
