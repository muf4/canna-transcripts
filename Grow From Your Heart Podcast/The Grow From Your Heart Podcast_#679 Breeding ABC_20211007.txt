[00:01.790 --> 00:18.200]  Alright, here we go.
[00:18.200 --> 00:19.880]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:19.880 --> 00:26.420]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 679 of the Grow From Your
[00:26.420 --> 00:28.000]  Heart Podcast.
[00:28.000 --> 00:31.500]  In this episode, I'm going to focus on a couple of Patreon questions.
[00:31.500 --> 00:34.760]  Before we get to that part of the show, I'd like to do a few shout-outs to a few of those
[00:34.760 --> 00:38.920]  great folks who continue to support the show on Patreon.
[00:39.000 --> 00:42.380]  Let's kick it off with a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast, thank you, shout-out to Mr.
[00:42.380 --> 00:43.380]  Mean Green.
[00:43.380 --> 00:46.700]  Let's send a big thank you shout-out to a longtime supporter of Brian Pyo.
[00:46.700 --> 00:50.700]  Let's send a fist bump and a thank you shout-out to another long-time supporter, my buddy Godfather
[00:50.700 --> 00:51.700]  Kush.
[00:51.700 --> 00:54.240]  Let's send a big fist bump and a thank you shout-out to Eldersgarden.
[00:54.240 --> 00:57.380]  Let's send a big thank you shout-out to Stone TroutBum.

[01:11.340 --> 01:12.340]  Hope you're doing well.
[01:12.340 --> 01:14.500]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Noah N.
[01:14.500 --> 01:17.220]  I want to send a thank you shout out to Root305.
[01:17.220 --> 01:19.820]  Let's send a big fist bump to BigSexyDank.
[01:19.820 --> 01:23.700]  Then let's wrap that all up with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out
[01:23.700 --> 01:26.220]  to my friend Growing Tennessee.
[01:26.220 --> 01:31.020]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:31.020 --> 01:34.680]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:34.680 --> 01:41.040]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[01:41.040 --> 01:44.360]  All of the information you need is right there on the screen and you know I do include a
[01:44.360 --> 01:51.440]  link in the show notes and the video description to make it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:51.440 --> 01:56.200]  You know this is the part of the podcast where I do invite you to join the Discord server.
[01:56.200 --> 02:00.120]  That's right there's an iRegenetics Grow From Your Heart Discord server.
[02:00.120 --> 02:02.880]  The link is in the show notes and in the video description.
[02:02.880 --> 02:06.200]  There's a lot of great stuff happening on Discord and I would really hate for you to
[02:06.200 --> 02:07.200]  miss the party.
[02:07.200 --> 02:13.960]  So come on join us on Discord follow the link in the show notes and the video description.
[02:13.960 --> 02:17.080]  All right this is the part of the show that I label the chatter.
[02:17.080 --> 02:20.040]  This is when I get to talk about all the fun shit that I did recently.
[02:20.040 --> 02:22.360]  I want to send a big shout out to my buddy Clint.
[02:22.360 --> 02:27.920]  Clint joined me for a comedy show a few nights ago and we had the time of our lives.
[02:27.920 --> 02:34.360]  We got to see Brendan Schaub, Chappelle Lacey, David Lucas, and Justin Elliott completely
[02:34.360 --> 02:37.440]  blow the roof off of Comedy Works.
[02:37.440 --> 02:40.920]  That's right we got to see them at the Comedy Works downtown.
[02:40.920 --> 02:42.640]  I knew Brendan Schaub was coming.
[02:42.640 --> 02:44.200]  He was the headlining act.
[02:44.200 --> 02:46.900]  He has been bringing Chappelle Lacey on tour with him.
[02:46.900 --> 02:50.760]  If you watch The Fighter and The Kid you know that Brendan is a headlining comedian and
[02:50.760 --> 02:53.320]  Chappelle Lacey not Dave Chappelle.
[02:53.320 --> 02:56.280]  When I say Chappelle people automatically think Dave Chappelle.
[02:56.280 --> 03:00.200]  Let me make this one clear not Dave Chappelle, Chappelle Lacey.
[03:00.200 --> 03:01.880]  Check him out he's a great comedian.
[03:01.880 --> 03:04.520]  But everybody knows that Schaub was the headliner.
[03:04.520 --> 03:06.120]  He sold the tickets it was his show.
[03:06.120 --> 03:09.840]  But if you watch the podcast do you know that Chappelle Lacey was going to be the opening
[03:09.840 --> 03:10.840]  act.
[03:10.840 --> 03:12.960]  It was a pleasant surprise to see David Lucas.
[03:12.960 --> 03:14.240]  I do believe that's his name.
[03:14.240 --> 03:17.280]  Big guy short dreadlocks really funny dude.
[03:17.280 --> 03:19.080]  I think David Lucas was his name.
[03:19.080 --> 03:23.080]  And then Justin Elliott as the emcee was a great surprise.
[03:23.080 --> 03:24.720]  Schaub takes that guy out on the road a lot.
[03:24.720 --> 03:26.200]  Wasn't certain he would be there.
[03:26.240 --> 03:31.000]  But it was great to see all four of them perform on the stage at Comedy Works.
[03:31.000 --> 03:32.320]  I'm a sneakerhead.
[03:32.320 --> 03:35.200]  Maybe a lot of you don't know that I am way into sneakers.
[03:35.200 --> 03:38.240]  During COVID during quarantine I wasn't able to go to concerts.
[03:38.240 --> 03:40.080]  Couldn't go to the comedy shows I love to go to.
[03:40.080 --> 03:42.460]  I invested in a sneaker collection.
[03:42.460 --> 03:43.960]  Many of you are bored of hearing about it.
[03:43.960 --> 03:45.420]  Many of you are just finding out about it.
[03:45.420 --> 03:46.420]  This will be brief.
[03:46.420 --> 03:47.720]  I like sneakers.
[03:47.720 --> 03:51.560]  I have a pair of sneakers I've been waiting for the perfect event to wear these sneakers
[03:51.560 --> 03:52.560]  to.
[03:52.560 --> 03:54.400]  My buddy Clint got a brand new pair of sneakers.
[03:54.400 --> 03:55.800]  We got out of the car.
[03:55.800 --> 03:57.680]  We were walking toward the comedy club.
[03:57.680 --> 04:01.640]  I saw this big squad of dudes coming just right down the street like they fucking own
[04:01.640 --> 04:02.640]  the world.
[04:02.640 --> 04:06.520]  I realized that guy in front is Chappelle Lacey and the guy right behind him is Brendan
[04:06.520 --> 04:07.520]  Schaub's brother.
[04:07.520 --> 04:10.840]  Oh and those other two dudes are David Lucas and Justin Elliott.
[04:10.840 --> 04:14.000]  And then as my stoned ass looked up, because I was kind of paying attention to traffic
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.120]  and walking and I was watching the world.
[04:16.120 --> 04:19.160]  I looked up and I hear nice kicks fellas.
[04:19.160 --> 04:22.720]  And it was my buddy Brendan Schaub complimenting my shoes.
[04:22.720 --> 04:23.720]  That was a great feeling.
[04:23.720 --> 04:24.720]  I was ready to go home.
[04:24.720 --> 04:26.360]  I didn't need to see any comedy at that point.
[04:26.360 --> 04:27.840]  I made the highlight of my night.
[04:27.840 --> 04:33.000]  But we went into the comedy club and those gentlemen rocked the place.
[04:33.000 --> 04:38.000]  I can't tell you how much I was missing comedy shows, live comedy, human interaction.
[04:38.000 --> 04:39.000]  It was a great time.
[04:39.000 --> 04:43.520]  Big shout out to Brendan Schaub, Chappelle Lacey, David Lucas, Justin Elliott.
[04:43.520 --> 04:45.120]  Big shout out to my buddy Clint.
[04:45.120 --> 04:48.840]  Then a big special fist bump to everybody at Comedy Works.
[04:48.840 --> 04:51.360]  I've got some friends that I've worked there for a long time.
[04:51.360 --> 04:53.960]  I've made some friends that just started working there.
[04:54.200 --> 04:56.280]  Big up, big respect to all of you folks.
[04:56.280 --> 04:58.200]  The club is just getting back on their feet.
[04:58.200 --> 04:59.400]  They were closed for a long time.
[04:59.400 --> 05:01.360]  So everybody's learning their jobs.
[05:01.360 --> 05:03.000]  Everybody, half the staff is new.
[05:03.000 --> 05:05.040]  Everybody's adjusting to new protocols.
[05:05.040 --> 05:06.080]  They're doing a great job.
[05:06.080 --> 05:11.080]  So if you're in Denver, if you're anywhere, I do recommend catching a show at the downtown
[05:11.080 --> 05:12.320]  Comedy Works.
[05:12.320 --> 05:13.320]  Go check it out.
[05:13.320 --> 05:14.320]  It'll be a great time.
[05:14.320 --> 05:15.320]  All right.
[05:15.320 --> 05:16.320]  That's enough rambling about the shit that I get to do.
[05:16.320 --> 05:17.320]  It's just been such a good time.
[05:17.320 --> 05:19.340]  I wanted to talk about it and give my friends a shout out.
[05:19.340 --> 05:21.840]  Give Clint, the comedians, and the club a shout out.
[05:21.840 --> 05:23.220]  I really enjoyed myself.
[05:23.220 --> 05:24.700]  He makes me happy.
[05:24.700 --> 05:26.580]  What's better than cannabis and comedy?
[05:26.580 --> 05:28.980]  There may be a couple things, but cannabis and comedy.
[05:28.980 --> 05:30.320]  Get stoned and laugh at some shit.
[05:30.320 --> 05:34.000]  It's like shaking off all the stress of the week, letting go all the bullshit that happened
[05:34.000 --> 05:36.000]  for a good hour and a half, two hours.
[05:36.000 --> 05:39.060]  You can't think about anything but that funny dude on stage.
[05:39.060 --> 05:42.220]  I think Shobb's a great dude, no matter if you like his comedy or not.
[05:42.220 --> 05:43.340]  So it was a great time going to see him.
[05:43.340 --> 05:45.100]  I got to take some pictures with him.
[05:45.100 --> 05:46.660]  Clint and I got our pictures with Shobb.
[05:46.660 --> 05:48.580]  I got a picture with Chappelle Lacey.
[05:48.580 --> 05:50.420]  That was a great time, great weekend.
[05:50.420 --> 05:51.660]  Things can't go wrong after that.
[05:51.660 --> 05:52.660]  All right.
[05:53.100 --> 05:54.100]  Chappelle Lacey.
[05:54.100 --> 05:56.420]  Shobb doesn't need any support, any shout outs, anything like that.
[05:56.420 --> 05:57.420]  I mean, follow him.
[05:57.420 --> 05:58.420]  He's a great dude.
[05:58.420 --> 05:59.580]  But Chappelle Lacey is up and coming.
[05:59.580 --> 06:02.460]  He's the one that we should mention and keep our eye out for.
[06:02.460 --> 06:03.460]  Shobb's already famous.
[06:03.460 --> 06:04.460]  He's got shows and shit.
[06:04.460 --> 06:06.020]  Look for Chappelle Lacey.
[06:06.020 --> 06:07.020]  S-H-A-P-P-E-L.
[06:07.020 --> 06:10.500]  Lacey is how I think you spell that.
[06:10.500 --> 06:12.180]  Not Dave Chappelle again, you guys.
[06:12.180 --> 06:15.540]  Every time I said Chappelle, somebody in my crew was like, you saw Dave Chappelle?
[06:15.540 --> 06:16.940]  No, I didn't say Dave Chappelle.
[06:16.940 --> 06:18.780]  I said Chappelle Lacey.
[06:18.780 --> 06:20.460]  Don't get too excited, but get excited.
[06:20.460 --> 06:21.620]  All right, let's keep moving.
[06:21.620 --> 06:23.420]  I do have more notes going on.
[06:23.420 --> 06:26.820]  The podcast has been ranking high on the audio servers.
[06:26.820 --> 06:29.980]  I've been getting a lot of notifications from Stitcher Radio.
[06:29.980 --> 06:32.180]  We ranked very high on Stitcher Radio.
[06:32.180 --> 06:36.780]  We ranked very high on Apple in the Apple Podcast application.
[06:36.780 --> 06:39.820]  We've been ranking very high on Podbean, on Spotify.
[06:39.820 --> 06:43.460]  The podcast has been getting noticed on the audio platforms.
[06:43.460 --> 06:46.420]  Big thank you to everybody listening on the audio platforms.
[06:46.420 --> 06:48.980]  I love it and I appreciate it.
[06:49.300 --> 06:51.420]  I do invite you to join us on YouTube.
[06:51.420 --> 06:54.780]  The YouTube numbers are what really count when it comes to advertising and trying to
[06:54.780 --> 06:55.780]  do things like that.
[06:55.780 --> 06:59.220]  I would appreciate it if you just give me a subscribe on YouTube.
[06:59.220 --> 07:01.980]  We're trying to push the show to 10,000 subscribers.
[07:01.980 --> 07:02.980]  We are almost there.
[07:02.980 --> 07:07.480]  I do appreciate, love, and respect everybody who subscribes to YouTube, but if you're watching,
[07:07.480 --> 07:11.340]  if you're listening on Spotify, Stitcher Radio, something like that, please just go to the
[07:11.340 --> 07:15.580]  YouTube channel, search Grow From Your Heart Podcast, and just click subscribe.
[07:15.580 --> 07:17.180]  Maybe click like on a few videos.
[07:17.180 --> 07:18.580]  I do invite you to watch the videos.
[07:18.580 --> 07:20.060]  I do put a lot of work into the videos.
[07:20.060 --> 07:24.580]  You may notice this video and the previous video are only one camera.
[07:24.580 --> 07:27.020]  The other camera is having some adjustments.
[07:27.020 --> 07:28.740]  It was getting a little blurry.
[07:28.740 --> 07:29.740]  It's still under warranty.
[07:29.740 --> 07:30.740]  It's brand new.
[07:30.740 --> 07:31.740]  It's getting fixed.
[07:31.740 --> 07:33.260]  Once I get that back, we'll go back to the multi-cam setup here.
[07:33.260 --> 07:35.180]  Nothing stressful, nothing to worry about.
[07:35.180 --> 07:36.940]  Shit happens, gear breaks.
[07:36.940 --> 07:39.420]  That camera was acting weird anyway, so I'm glad I got to send it back.
[07:39.420 --> 07:43.660]  Get it a little refurbished, a little inspection, see what's going on with that thing, but only
[07:43.660 --> 07:46.500]  one camera for this episode and the last episode.
[07:46.500 --> 07:47.500]  I'm transparent.
[07:47.620 --> 07:48.620]  No one camera was being weird.
[07:48.620 --> 07:50.460]  I'll send it to a repair tech.
[07:50.460 --> 07:51.460]  It'll get fixed.
[07:51.460 --> 07:52.460]  It'll come back.
[07:52.460 --> 07:55.420]  We'll get back to the multi-cam, but I invite you to check out the YouTube channel because
[07:55.420 --> 07:59.820]  I'm doing a multi-cam 4K show with cool intros and stuff like that.
[07:59.820 --> 08:04.460]  All right, I do have one more quick topic to cover before we get to the main topic of
[08:04.460 --> 08:05.780]  this podcast.
[08:05.780 --> 08:11.220]  In a previous episode, I was wearing a brand new Iry Genetics Orange Gasm hoodie.
[08:11.220 --> 08:13.260]  I got a lot of responses to that hoodie.
[08:13.260 --> 08:14.300]  They are now available.
[08:14.300 --> 08:15.620]  They are on the website.
[08:15.620 --> 08:18.740]  If you go to irygenetics.com, click on the Iry store.
[08:18.740 --> 08:21.540]  That will take you right to the store where you can buy those hoodies.
[08:21.540 --> 08:22.540]  They are available now.
[08:22.540 --> 08:26.140]  I did replenish them, but they do sell out quite quickly.
[08:26.140 --> 08:30.660]  If you want the Orange Gasm hoodie or any other Iry merch, they are on the website at
[08:30.660 --> 08:31.660]  irygenetics.com.
[08:31.660 --> 08:36.700]  All right, I promised you that would be the last bit of rambling before we got into the
[08:36.700 --> 08:38.340]  main part of this podcast.
[08:38.340 --> 08:40.860]  I do have a message that came from Patreon.
[08:40.860 --> 08:43.980]  They signed it from Locomotive Medical.
[08:43.980 --> 08:46.340]  The message goes just like this.
[08:46.340 --> 08:48.260]  It says, hey, Ross to Jeff.
[08:48.260 --> 08:52.500]  First off, thank you for putting out so much quality cannabis information for free.
[08:52.500 --> 08:54.580]  Yes, you are very welcome.
[08:54.580 --> 08:58.180]  Thank you for noticing that I try to put out quality, and thank you for noticing that it
[08:58.180 --> 08:59.820]  is free.
[08:59.820 --> 09:04.020]  I've said several times, and I keep saying this podcast will always be free.
[09:04.020 --> 09:06.060]  I have not put out Patreon content.
[09:06.060 --> 09:07.500]  I've never charged for the show.
[09:07.500 --> 09:10.100]  I've made sure to put out all of this content for free.
[09:10.100 --> 09:11.940]  It will always be free.
[09:11.940 --> 09:16.900]  I think that even if I were to die or something, the podcast would still last for quite a while
[09:16.900 --> 09:18.380]  as long as we pay for the website.
[09:18.380 --> 09:20.620]  The website comes out of a bank account.
[09:20.620 --> 09:23.100]  The bank account's got a good chunk of money in there.
[09:23.100 --> 09:27.860]  The website will keep getting paid for for a few years until that bank account diminishes.
[09:27.860 --> 09:29.780]  That bank account is attached to Patreon.
[09:29.780 --> 09:33.020]  If you guys pay Patreon, the bank account will get money.
[09:33.020 --> 09:37.140]  That'll pay for the website, which will pay for the server to keep all the shows up forever.
[09:37.140 --> 09:38.780]  The show should live forever.
[09:38.780 --> 09:41.860]  YouTube won't take down the videos ever.
[09:41.860 --> 09:43.740]  Unless we do something stupid.
[09:43.740 --> 09:48.860]  The information should be up there forever for free, which I think is pretty damn cool.
[09:48.860 --> 09:49.860]  I'm rambling because I'm stoned.
[09:49.860 --> 09:52.580]  Let me get myself back on track.
[09:52.580 --> 09:56.020]  I've spent hundreds upon hundreds of hours listening to the Grow From Your Heart podcast
[09:56.020 --> 10:01.660]  while gardening, and your practices have impacted mine more than anyone else.
[10:01.660 --> 10:02.660]  I love that.
[10:02.660 --> 10:05.840]  I love that I'm helping you out, that I'm making a difference, and also that I'm helping
[10:05.840 --> 10:09.220]  you pass time and get through the workday.
[10:09.220 --> 10:12.340]  Working in the garden sometimes can be tedious and a little bit stressful, and it can be
[10:12.340 --> 10:13.340]  exhausting.
[10:13.340 --> 10:16.380]  If I'm in there in your ear keeping you motivated, that can keep you going.
[10:16.380 --> 10:19.380]  So I'm glad I'm keeping you going, and I'm glad I had some impact.
[10:19.380 --> 10:23.260]  It's good to know that the work I do is impactful.
[10:23.260 --> 10:24.420]  Is impactful a word?
[10:24.420 --> 10:25.420]  I don't know.
[10:25.420 --> 10:26.740]  Tell Christina that it sure is.
[10:26.740 --> 10:29.500]  If you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about.
[10:29.500 --> 10:30.500]  Let's see.
[10:30.500 --> 10:31.500]  There is more to this.
[10:31.500 --> 10:36.580]  It says, I am working with mutants in the Australian bastard cannabis freak show and
[10:36.580 --> 10:41.020]  the Cali Seeds hops cross families.
[10:41.020 --> 10:47.120]  Our friend here is working with the Australian bastard cannabis and freak show and the Cali
[10:47.120 --> 10:49.300]  Seeds hops cross families.
[10:49.300 --> 10:53.140]  I'm very familiar with the Australian bastard and the freak show, that Cali Seeds, I don't
[10:53.140 --> 10:56.340]  know what you're talking about to be quite honest.
[10:56.340 --> 11:00.620]  You guys may have seen pictures of the freak show and Australian bastard cannabis.
[11:00.620 --> 11:03.040]  They look a little bit more like a fern.
[11:03.040 --> 11:04.560]  They look like some kind of different plant.
[11:04.560 --> 11:09.960]  They don't look like the traditional cannabis plants we're familiar with seeing in most
[11:09.960 --> 11:10.960]  gardens.
[11:10.960 --> 11:12.680]  Apparently one is Australian.
[11:12.680 --> 11:16.920]  I think both of them have the freak show and the Australian bastard have Australian genetics
[11:16.920 --> 11:17.920]  in them.
[11:17.920 --> 11:19.320]  They grow quite strangely.
[11:19.320 --> 11:20.320]  Our friend is grow.
[11:20.320 --> 11:25.000]  Oh, before I get sidetracked, let me give a big shout out to Trey K DGC.
[11:25.000 --> 11:26.360]  Trey K grew.
[11:26.360 --> 11:29.040]  Let me try that sentence again without any editing.
[11:29.040 --> 11:36.320]  Trey K DGC grew some freak show cannabis and it made some mutant trichomes and she was
[11:36.320 --> 11:39.600]  able to get them photographed by a wonderful photographer.
[11:39.600 --> 11:44.220]  So make sure you check out Trey K DGC for some great trichome photos.
[11:44.220 --> 11:45.880]  Big up and much respect.
[11:45.880 --> 11:49.480]  Good cannabis teacher, very well educated.
[11:49.480 --> 11:52.140]  That's going to be a good powerful person in the cannabis industry and the cannabis
[11:52.140 --> 11:53.140]  space here.
[11:53.140 --> 11:54.140]  So give them a follow.
[11:54.140 --> 11:55.720]  Shout out to Trey K DGC.
[11:55.720 --> 11:57.720]  Let me keep myself moving.
[11:57.720 --> 11:58.720]  Where were I?
[11:58.720 --> 12:02.320]  Uh, the Australian freak show, Australian bastard freak show.
[12:02.320 --> 12:04.520]  It says here they are all slow.
[12:04.520 --> 12:08.440]  Uh, it says a bastard seems 60% of the speed.
[12:08.440 --> 12:11.880]  Freaks are at 70 to 80% of the speed and they are low potency.
[12:11.880 --> 12:15.480]  Uh, sounds like a pain in the ass plant and it sounds like it's only novel to grow it
[12:15.480 --> 12:18.360]  once or twice and then you'd probably get over it if that's all accurate.
[12:18.360 --> 12:23.160]  It goes on to say, I'm thankfully not working with any of the very weak original varietals,
[12:23.160 --> 12:27.800]  but newer higher potency crosses that are still only in the high teens and cannabinoid
[12:27.800 --> 12:28.800]  percentage.
[12:28.800 --> 12:33.120]  I talked about it before just because it's low teens and cannabinoids.
[12:33.120 --> 12:34.120]  How are the turps?
[12:34.120 --> 12:35.760]  How are the other things?
[12:35.760 --> 12:37.400]  How is the buzz when you smoke it?
[12:37.400 --> 12:40.400]  Uh, maybe the numbers are low, but how is it when you smoke it?
[12:40.400 --> 12:41.400]  Do you enjoy it?
[12:41.400 --> 12:42.720]  Does the crew enjoy it?
[12:42.720 --> 12:43.720]  What's that like?
[12:43.720 --> 12:44.720]  I'm curious.
[12:44.720 --> 12:45.720]  We'll keep going.
[12:45.720 --> 12:46.720]  There's more to this.
[12:46.720 --> 12:50.560]  It says, I'd like to ask your thoughts on what I read genetic strains you would recommend
[12:50.640 --> 12:54.600]  in order to bring up both vigor and potency of these mutant plants?
[12:54.600 --> 12:56.640]  Uh, that's a really good question.
[12:56.640 --> 13:01.320]  Um, I often have called a rise King Solomon, the fixer plant.
[13:01.320 --> 13:04.440]  So the first obvious answer there, let me, let me back up a little bit.
[13:04.440 --> 13:06.600]  Our friend is not happy with the performance of this plant.
[13:06.600 --> 13:11.800]  So they're looking for something to breed it to, to enhance the lacking qualities, which
[13:11.800 --> 13:16.160]  are the potency and the vigor and the growth structure and rate of this plant.
[13:16.160 --> 13:21.880]  I think that King Solomon or a rise would be a beautiful plant to fix almost anything,
[13:21.880 --> 13:23.720]  which is why I breed with it so much.
[13:23.720 --> 13:28.880]  I find plants that are nines and he pollinate them with King Solomon and they become 11s.
[13:28.880 --> 13:33.120]  So my first answer is obviously going to be a rise that will increase your potency.
[13:33.120 --> 13:34.560]  That will increase the vigor.
[13:34.560 --> 13:39.080]  That'll increase the, uh, the structure of the plant, the, the, uh, the sturdiness, the
[13:39.080 --> 13:40.080]  amount of branching.
[13:40.080 --> 13:42.160]  It'll do a lot of good things for that plant.
[13:42.160 --> 13:47.680]  So I would say a rise would be my number one, uh, choice because a rise has given me
[13:47.680 --> 13:51.120]  the highest lab tests I've seen a rise grows the fastest.
[13:51.120 --> 13:53.320]  Uh, it's just a winner all around.
[13:53.320 --> 13:57.340]  And I call it the fixer because it kind of goes in and it's like, ah, this is cool on
[13:57.340 --> 13:59.120]  your traits, but how about we just fix this?
[13:59.120 --> 14:01.560]  And it like knows what to do.
[14:01.560 --> 14:03.160]  Other things I would recommend though.
[14:03.160 --> 14:05.560]  Um, and I always say it's about your goal.
[14:05.560 --> 14:07.400]  I see that your goal is to fix this.
[14:07.400 --> 14:09.000]  That's why I recommend a rise right away.
[14:09.000 --> 14:12.220]  Your goal is to fix these plants and improve their performance.
[14:12.220 --> 14:15.700]  So knowing your goal helps out a lot, but what kind of turps are you after?
[14:15.700 --> 14:16.880]  What kind of buzz are you after?
[14:16.880 --> 14:19.140]  What kind of flowering time are you looking for?
[14:19.140 --> 14:22.440]  If that stuff doesn't matter, um, then just do the arise.
[14:22.440 --> 14:27.200]  If you want something flavorful with some funky flavors, I would recommend the blueberry
[14:27.200 --> 14:29.560]  butcher or the blue raspberry truffle.
[14:29.560 --> 14:33.240]  Those will both breed crazy turps into your offspring.
[14:33.240 --> 14:38.320]  Uh, the blueberry butcher, the offspring you breed from that may be a little more difficult
[14:38.320 --> 14:40.920]  to grow because it's got that Jack the Ripper in there.
[14:40.920 --> 14:43.720]  Uh, some of those progeny were a little more difficult.
[14:43.720 --> 14:45.260]  They grow taller, thinner.
[14:45.260 --> 14:47.420]  They got that sort of haze thing to them.
[14:47.420 --> 14:51.520]  Those may be difficult, but they would correct the problems coming from the butcher.
[14:51.520 --> 14:54.080]  They've got the things that you're, uh, from your bastard.
[14:54.080 --> 14:55.880]  They've got the things that it is lacking.
[14:55.880 --> 14:58.680]  The blue raspberry truffle is half a rise.
[14:58.680 --> 15:02.960]  So you're going to get the improvements from a rise plus the vigor from the blueberry cookies
[15:02.960 --> 15:06.640]  plus the turps from both of those strains added to your bastard.
[15:06.640 --> 15:08.840]  That's going to be some amazing flavors right there.
[15:08.840 --> 15:11.680]  Uh, then I would say Sonic Boom.
[15:11.680 --> 15:16.960]  If you want to increase potency and growth speed and vigor and plant size, Sonic Boom
[15:16.960 --> 15:20.780]  is quite often overlooked for its impressiveness.
[15:20.780 --> 15:22.840]  In my opinion, it's got great turps.
[15:22.840 --> 15:28.600]  Uh, it's like a lemon lime Gatorade powder and chemicals and it's fucking tremendous
[15:28.600 --> 15:35.300]  in my opinion and it grows very quickly and it produces super rock hard, super dense buds
[15:35.300 --> 15:39.300]  that are covered in trichomes and it's, I call it Sonic Boom cause it's like when you
[15:39.300 --> 15:43.340]  smoke it, you're like Sonic Boom and your whole brain goes, Oh shit dude.
[15:43.340 --> 15:47.220]  Like you're so high that you need a minute and then you try to go do stuff and the neighborhoods
[15:47.220 --> 15:50.500]  vibrating and lighten up like it's, it's really potent weed.
[15:50.500 --> 15:54.540]  So that's why I call it Sonic Boom and I would recommend a breeding to the Sonic Boom.
[15:54.540 --> 15:56.100]  That would make a great breeder.
[15:56.100 --> 15:58.820]  A Sonic Boom would breed great to all kinds of stuff.
[15:58.820 --> 16:02.260]  If you're trying to fix a plant, Sonic Boom would be a good breeder.
[16:02.260 --> 16:04.220]  Now let's go the other direction.
[16:04.220 --> 16:09.320]  The things I've been talking about are more on the, uh, skinny leaf drug varietal type
[16:09.320 --> 16:10.320]  of cannabis.
[16:10.320 --> 16:13.780]  Going to give you more of that head buzz, that longer flowering time.
[16:13.780 --> 16:18.820]  What if we took this Australian bastard cannabis and your freak show and we cross them to a
[16:18.820 --> 16:19.900]  morning dew?
[16:19.900 --> 16:23.620]  My morning dew is more of one of my Indica dominant crosses.
[16:23.620 --> 16:28.460]  It's more on the Indica side, the wider leaf, chill you out, sit you down, kind of, kind
[16:28.460 --> 16:29.460]  of a varietal.
[16:29.460 --> 16:31.060]  Uh, what if you cross it to that?
[16:31.060 --> 16:32.780]  That would give you some good turps.
[16:32.780 --> 16:36.500]  It would give you a nice growth structure and it would improve the vigor and I think
[16:36.500 --> 16:38.620]  it would definitely improve the potency.
[16:38.620 --> 16:40.780]  So morning dew may be a good option.
[16:40.780 --> 16:45.100]  And then if you want to get crazy, let's cross it to the machine.
[16:45.100 --> 16:48.020]  The machine grows so big and so fast.
[16:48.020 --> 16:50.620]  The machine is one of the biggest plants in my garden.
[16:50.620 --> 16:56.380]  Uh, it's got the most nugs, it's got big gigantic leaves, it's got super stank to it, but it's
[16:56.380 --> 16:58.920]  also kind of lanky and stretchy.
[16:58.920 --> 17:02.380]  So that would speed up your plant and it would make it bigger, but it may make it a little
[17:02.380 --> 17:03.600]  bit stretchy and viney.
[17:03.600 --> 17:08.260]  The only way to find out is to find the phenotype you want to breed to it.
[17:08.260 --> 17:13.020]  Maybe find a really short squatty male machine plant and hit that freak show, hit that Australian
[17:13.020 --> 17:17.300]  bastard and your other hop looking plant with a short squatty machine phenotype.
[17:17.300 --> 17:19.840]  And I think you'd make some amazing shit.
[17:19.840 --> 17:23.400]  Really though, um, it's all about seeing the plants.
[17:23.400 --> 17:27.140]  People often ask me, a lot of episodes have been people asking me for breeding guidance
[17:27.140 --> 17:28.140]  and breeding advice.
[17:28.140 --> 17:29.900]  Like, Hey, what would you breed this to?
[17:29.900 --> 17:32.020]  Or what would you breed to this to fix it?
[17:32.020 --> 17:34.020]  A lot of it is seeing the plants.
[17:34.020 --> 17:38.420]  Like I can make good recommendations knowing the Mendel charts, knowing the history, knowing
[17:38.420 --> 17:42.660]  the pedigree, the lineage, the genetics, uh, the breakdown of these plants.
[17:42.660 --> 17:48.380]  I can predict and anticipate a lot, but without having grown these plants, without seeing
[17:48.380 --> 17:52.060]  them, without touching them, without smelling them, without knowing how they respond to
[17:52.060 --> 17:57.140]  the environment, without just being around them, I am not certain what are the best breeders
[17:57.140 --> 17:58.140]  sometimes.
[17:58.140 --> 17:59.140]  And it sounds crazy.
[17:59.140 --> 18:02.660]  I'll be walking through a commercial grow and I'll just be watching the plants and I'll
[18:02.660 --> 18:04.140]  go to that grow for a few times.
[18:04.140 --> 18:07.020]  And I'll say that one plant on the end corner gets my eye every time.
[18:07.020 --> 18:10.740]  And so I'll ask somebody on the third or fourth visit, like, Hey bro, what is this plant?
[18:10.740 --> 18:11.980]  And they'll tell me that's this.
[18:11.980 --> 18:15.820]  And I'll say that plant will work beautifully to my Jack the Ripper.
[18:15.820 --> 18:18.060]  And I'll get a clone of it and I'll cross it to Jack the Ripper.
[18:18.060 --> 18:19.060]  And guess what?
[18:19.060 --> 18:20.060]  Full success.
[18:20.060 --> 18:23.740]  It's just something intuitive in me after doing it for so long.
[18:23.740 --> 18:28.220]  So I say, learn about breeding, learn about your plants, learn about each plant that you're
[18:28.300 --> 18:30.100]  going to breed with.
[18:30.100 --> 18:34.420]  Learn about the male plant, learn its traits, learn how long it flowers, learn what it enjoys,
[18:34.420 --> 18:36.980]  learn the female plants you're going to breed with.
[18:36.980 --> 18:38.180]  What are they susceptible to?
[18:38.180 --> 18:39.300]  What are they resistant to?
[18:39.300 --> 18:42.000]  How do they react to certain environmental stresses?
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.300]  How do they react to your abuse?
[18:44.300 --> 18:48.780]  Learn all of the plants, then learn about aliel charts and Mendel charts and learn about
[18:48.780 --> 18:52.120]  chromosomes and learn about DNA transfer.
[18:52.120 --> 19:00.440]  Learn about progeny and memetics and then forget all of that and breed with your intuition.
[19:00.440 --> 19:04.120]  I know that sounds completely crazy, but I know how to read music.
[19:04.120 --> 19:05.120]  I know how to write music.
[19:05.120 --> 19:08.760]  I know how to think about my posture and my finger grip and where my foot's placed on
[19:08.760 --> 19:12.600]  the pedal and how my back is straight and how my arms and shoulders are aligned on the
[19:12.600 --> 19:13.720]  drum kit.
[19:13.720 --> 19:17.440]  And I know how to think that the, I know how to count compound time and I know how to think
[19:17.440 --> 19:19.800]  where the bass player and the guitar player are in the music.
[19:20.120 --> 19:24.360]  But when it comes to playing music, I forget all that shit and I play what sounds really
[19:24.360 --> 19:28.480]  good because I've got enough experience to rely on myself and know that I know how to
[19:28.480 --> 19:32.320]  make the right choices musically and I can do that with breeding plants as well.
[19:32.320 --> 19:37.920]  If I were on stage counting one E and a two E and a, the music's going to sound like shit.
[19:37.920 --> 19:43.220]  But if I go up there and go, we can all dance and it sounds like a really good time.
[19:43.220 --> 19:48.320]  So learn the things that you need to know, get a good education, a solid foundation,
[19:48.680 --> 19:50.520]  you'll be good at it and do it comfortably.
[19:50.520 --> 19:53.400]  And I kind of think that breeding, my breeding works that way.
[19:53.400 --> 19:57.960]  It's sort of like I, I say that like I'm a plant matchmaker, I'm a cannabis porn producer
[19:57.960 --> 19:58.960]  or something like that.
[19:58.960 --> 20:03.240]  I just, I can see it and I just know I can kind of, when I'm going to cross plants, I
[20:03.240 --> 20:07.280]  can tell you pretty closely to what the progeny will be.
[20:07.280 --> 20:11.960]  I can give predictions and most of the time my breeding predictions are fairly accurate
[20:11.960 --> 20:13.480]  and that's just from doing it so long.
[20:13.480 --> 20:15.480]  It's like being a chef or a musician.
[20:15.480 --> 20:17.800]  You've been in the kitchen, you've been on the stage so long.
[20:17.800 --> 20:21.320]  You throw your hands up in the air and suddenly magic happens because you're so experienced
[20:21.320 --> 20:22.320]  at it.
[20:22.320 --> 20:24.920]  So I'd like to give you really good breeding advice.
[20:24.920 --> 20:29.360]  I've given you a few strains to choose from, but honestly learn the Mendel charts, learn
[20:29.360 --> 20:33.400]  the plant biology, learn all of that stuff as deep as you can.
[20:33.400 --> 20:38.600]  Then forget it all and use your intuition by looking at the plants, touch them, rub
[20:38.600 --> 20:39.880]  them, smell them.
[20:39.880 --> 20:41.880]  Like that's what really matters.
[20:41.880 --> 20:45.400]  We've got all of the right senses to make all of the right decisions.
[20:45.400 --> 20:48.880]  Your nose, your fingers, your eyes, all of those things.
[20:48.880 --> 20:51.780]  Just use those things to make the right decisions in breeding.
[20:51.780 --> 20:55.000]  Of course you're going to have to breed out, grow out those seeds to see if you did anything
[20:55.000 --> 20:59.880]  right or wrong, but in most cases if you're working with good modern cannabis and you're,
[20:59.880 --> 21:04.260]  especially not to toot my own horn, if you're selecting a male from my line, you're going
[21:04.260 --> 21:05.960]  to find something quality.
[21:05.960 --> 21:09.840]  You know you're starting with quality genetics and it's going to be something good.
[21:09.840 --> 21:13.840]  So you'll see improvement on the line and that is your main goal to improve the line.
[21:13.840 --> 21:17.360]  So find something that gets your attention.
[21:17.360 --> 21:19.360]  It's got to smell good, taste good, look good.
[21:19.360 --> 21:20.360]  It's got to sing to you.
[21:20.360 --> 21:23.960]  It's like finding a date and I don't want to be responsible for picking your date.
[21:23.960 --> 21:27.960]  I don't know what you're into and I don't want you to blame it on me later when it goes
[21:27.960 --> 21:28.960]  wrong.
[21:28.960 --> 21:32.920]  So do your best to make your best selections based on the criteria that I have given you.
[21:32.920 --> 21:36.480]  I'm quite rambly so I'm going to get back into this message.
[21:36.480 --> 21:40.480]  It says, I'm really confident in your strains because every strain of yours I've tried I
[21:40.480 --> 21:41.480]  have loved.
[21:41.480 --> 21:44.720]  And it kind of backs up what I just said that my strains are going to work for you.
[21:44.720 --> 21:46.480]  So respect, thank you for that.
[21:46.480 --> 21:48.240]  Thank you for trying my strains.
[21:48.240 --> 21:52.560]  They're all dank as hell, stank like hell and everything except for, and then you list
[21:52.560 --> 21:53.760]  a couple, grew like crazy.
[21:53.760 --> 21:57.680]  And I'm not going to list a couple because those should have grown like crazy for you.
[21:57.680 --> 22:00.640]  You just had small phenos or something.
[22:00.640 --> 22:03.280]  But it says, head and shoulders above everything else.
[22:03.280 --> 22:09.220]  I really enjoyed the Arise, Firefly, Sun Kiss, Sunshine Girl, Dragon Punch, and Scarlet Begonias.
[22:09.220 --> 22:15.180]  And I liked Sonic Boom so much that I bred it to about 30 of over 300 strains re-grew
[22:15.180 --> 22:18.620]  commercially in 2019.
[22:18.620 --> 22:23.380]  I don't think that I had read that part of the message when I decided to tell you to
[22:23.380 --> 22:24.620]  breed to Sonic Boom.
[22:24.620 --> 22:27.020]  That may, I don't think I got that far.
[22:27.020 --> 22:28.380]  So do that again.
[22:28.380 --> 22:29.740]  It sounds like it's working for you.
[22:29.740 --> 22:31.080]  It sounds like it was a good decision.
[22:31.080 --> 22:32.740]  We both thought of that.
[22:32.740 --> 22:33.740]  Do that again.
[22:33.740 --> 22:36.980]  If we both think that's the way to go, that is the way to go.
[22:36.980 --> 22:42.300]  It says, some awesome iReed discord server members recommended that Donatello would bring
[22:42.300 --> 22:47.620]  some crazy vigor while either Orangegasm or Blueberry Butcher would throw in the potency
[22:47.620 --> 22:50.660]  department, would throw down in the potency department.
[22:50.660 --> 22:52.580]  All of that is highly accurate.
[22:52.580 --> 22:58.600]  Unfortunately, Donatello is sold out and discontinued and it is feminized.
[22:58.600 --> 23:01.980]  So you'd have to reverse that if you were going to work with that.
[23:01.980 --> 23:04.220]  There's no male to be found.
[23:04.220 --> 23:06.140]  The same thing with the Orangegasm.
[23:06.140 --> 23:10.420]  The Orangegasm is not discontinued, but it is sold out on most formats in most places.
[23:10.420 --> 23:11.420]  It will be back.
[23:11.420 --> 23:12.420]  Don't worry.
[23:12.420 --> 23:14.060]  But it is feminized.
[23:14.060 --> 23:15.780]  So you won't find a male in there.
[23:15.780 --> 23:20.240]  You would have to reverse it and make a feminized outcross of these seeds, which wouldn't be
[23:20.240 --> 23:22.380]  a problem, but I don't know that that's your goal.
[23:22.380 --> 23:26.020]  It sounds like you're looking for a male to pollinate your freak show plants with.
[23:26.020 --> 23:32.260]  So I may sway away or stray away from the Donny or the Orangegasm for the fems.
[23:32.260 --> 23:37.260]  The Blueberry Butcher though is absolutely correct that it would throw down in that potency
[23:37.260 --> 23:38.340]  department.
[23:38.340 --> 23:42.740]  Also vigorous plants, super vigor, good potency, good turps.
[23:42.740 --> 23:48.480]  I would do a lot of repairing, but also you're going to find longer finishing plants in there
[23:48.480 --> 23:52.180]  because of that haze history within those genetics.
[23:52.180 --> 23:53.460]  So it says, what do you think?
[23:53.460 --> 23:55.500]  Man, I think I told you what I think.
[23:55.500 --> 23:57.620]  I think I spit out enough info on that one.
[23:57.620 --> 23:59.260]  I hope you got some good advice.
[23:59.260 --> 24:01.740]  It says, thank you again for everything you do.
[24:01.740 --> 24:04.580]  Much love from Locomotive Medical.
[24:04.580 --> 24:07.900]  My man Locomotive Medical, big thank you for the great question.
[24:07.900 --> 24:10.100]  Big thanks and respect for breeding with my products.
[24:10.100 --> 24:14.740]  It means a lot to me that everybody out there, it means a lot to me that you guys trust my
[24:14.740 --> 24:17.420]  brand enough to breed with my seeds.
[24:17.420 --> 24:18.420]  That's a lot.
[24:18.420 --> 24:20.620]  Just growing it is a big dedication, a big commitment.
[24:20.620 --> 24:22.420]  You spent money on a product.
[24:22.420 --> 24:23.420]  Money's expensive.
[24:23.420 --> 24:24.420]  I know how hard you work.
[24:24.420 --> 24:28.820]  You're sweating, you're doing shit you don't want to do for somebody that doesn't respect
[24:28.820 --> 24:30.540]  you that you don't want to be around.
[24:30.540 --> 24:32.860]  You'd rather go pet your puppy or play your Xbox.
[24:32.860 --> 24:33.860]  I get it.
[24:33.860 --> 24:37.580]  So it means a lot to me that first of all, you chose to buy seeds from my brand.
[24:37.580 --> 24:39.120]  That does mean a lot to me.
[24:39.120 --> 24:41.720]  You trusted them to grow them and put in your garden.
[24:41.720 --> 24:45.860]  You've got them for nine weeks in flower, another five weeks in veg probably.
[24:45.860 --> 24:48.300]  You've got my plants for 14 weeks in your garden.
[24:48.300 --> 24:49.300]  Thank you.
[24:49.300 --> 24:52.360]  Then you guys trust my product enough to breed to it.
[24:52.360 --> 24:53.560]  That means a lot to me.
[24:53.560 --> 24:57.740]  Your future gardens rely on my garden, my product.
[24:57.740 --> 24:59.160]  So that means a lot to me.
[24:59.160 --> 25:00.420]  That does hit me.
[25:01.300 --> 25:02.300]  It's not left unnoticed.
[25:02.300 --> 25:03.300]  It's humbling.
[25:03.300 --> 25:04.820]  It fills me with pride.
[25:04.820 --> 25:06.000]  It gives me a lot of emotion.
[25:06.000 --> 25:07.000]  So thank you guys.
[25:07.000 --> 25:08.000]  That means a lot to me.
[25:08.000 --> 25:11.840]  It inspires me to keep going and make even better shit for you guys to breed with.
[25:11.840 --> 25:12.840]  That's the only way to do it.
[25:12.840 --> 25:15.620]  I got to stay ahead so that you guys can breed with good shit.
[25:15.620 --> 25:16.620]  All right.
[25:16.620 --> 25:17.620]  I am rambly.
[25:17.620 --> 25:18.620]  I hope you enjoyed this episode.
[25:18.620 --> 25:20.880]  I'm going to wrap it up because my voice is burning out.
[25:20.880 --> 25:21.980]  My throat is starting to hurt.
[25:21.980 --> 25:23.420]  I'm getting super dry.
[25:23.420 --> 25:24.660]  These muscles right here are done.
[25:24.660 --> 25:26.060]  So it is time to wrap up this podcast.

[25:32.420 --> 25:34.780]  It blows my mind to say 679.
