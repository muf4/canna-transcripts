[00:00.060 --> 00:19.240]  Alright, here we go.
[00:19.240 --> 00:20.920]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:20.920 --> 00:27.960]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 692 of the Grow From Your
[00:27.960 --> 00:29.640]  Heart Podcast.
[00:29.640 --> 00:33.320]  In this episode, we're going to talk about my new strain called The Machine.
[00:33.320 --> 00:36.800]  Before we get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of the great
[00:36.800 --> 00:41.080]  folks who continue to support the show on Patreon.
[00:41.080 --> 00:45.360]  Let's kick it off with a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out to Jessica

[01:12.280 --> 01:16.200]  Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out
[01:16.200 --> 01:18.440]  to my buddy Trike Man.
[01:18.440 --> 01:23.440]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:23.440 --> 01:27.220]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:27.220 --> 01:33.840]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:33.840 --> 01:36.640]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:36.640 --> 01:41.080]  And of course I do include a link in the show notes and in the video description to
[01:41.080 --> 01:44.120]  make it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:44.120 --> 01:48.600]  This is the part of the show where I remind you about the Black Friday sale on the iRegenetics
[01:48.600 --> 01:49.600]  merch store.
[01:49.600 --> 01:50.600]  That's right.
[01:50.600 --> 01:53.840]  If you're looking for fresh t-shirts, maybe you need a grinder, a tray, maybe a coffee
[01:53.840 --> 01:55.760]  mug, maybe a mood mat.
[01:55.760 --> 01:59.380]  Those things are now available on the iRegenetics merch store.
[01:59.380 --> 02:03.060]  All you have to do is go to the iRegenetics website, click on the merch tab that will
[02:03.060 --> 02:04.600]  take you right to the store.
[02:04.600 --> 02:08.560]  When you are checking out, use coupon code GFYH25.
[02:08.560 --> 02:11.900]  That will save you 25% off everything in the store.
[02:11.900 --> 02:15.880]  That sale does start on the 25th and that will end November 30th.
[02:15.880 --> 02:20.360]  Once again, the coupon code is GFYH25.
[02:20.360 --> 02:23.320]  All right, at the top of the show, I did say that we were going to talk about my new strain
[02:23.320 --> 02:24.320]  called The Machine.
[02:24.320 --> 02:28.240]  I do have a great email here from our friend Marco Esquandolos.
[02:28.240 --> 02:30.680]  Big shout out to my buddy Marco Esquandolos.
[02:30.680 --> 02:32.240]  Rye, rye, Rocco.
[02:32.240 --> 02:37.640]  The question goes, hey Rasta Jeff, I'm sure you get a lot of requests for podcasts dedicated
[02:37.640 --> 02:42.920]  to your seed varieties, but I thought I would ask a few specific questions to help spur
[02:42.920 --> 02:44.320]  your thoughts.
[02:44.320 --> 02:48.960]  This was a perfectly timed email because I am going to release The Machine and the Saka
[02:48.960 --> 02:51.240]  Souffle both on Black Friday.
[02:51.240 --> 02:53.840]  Those will be part of the Black Friday sale.
[02:53.840 --> 02:56.760]  He does ask about Saka Souffle and The Machine.
[02:56.760 --> 03:00.560]  This episode is going to be focused on The Machine, so I'm going to skip right to that
[03:00.560 --> 03:01.560]  question.
[03:01.600 --> 03:05.480]  The Machine, what is chemdelechem and which breeder?
[03:05.480 --> 03:06.480]  That's a very good question.
[03:06.480 --> 03:11.720]  There is more to this, but I kind of wanted to focus on those two strains for the next
[03:11.720 --> 03:12.800]  two episodes.
[03:12.800 --> 03:14.240]  This episode will be The Machine.
[03:14.240 --> 03:17.680]  The next episode obviously will be the Saka Souffle.
[03:17.680 --> 03:19.000]  Let's talk a little bit about those.
[03:19.000 --> 03:22.360]  So I do have a bunch of notes here about The Machine.
[03:22.360 --> 03:25.560]  Let me cut the rambling and jump right into it.
[03:25.560 --> 03:26.560]  The Machine.
[03:26.560 --> 03:31.520]  If you've been following my social media, you have been seeing the, or my Discord even,
[03:31.520 --> 03:33.840]  you've been seeing a lot of posts about The Machine.
[03:33.840 --> 03:39.880]  The Machine has been in testing and it has been showing great, amazing, impressive results.
[03:39.880 --> 03:43.360]  A lot of the people testing it have harvested their test crops.
[03:43.360 --> 03:44.600]  They are now smoking it.
[03:44.600 --> 03:49.160]  I've actually tasted and smoked some concentrates made from a test run of The Machine.
[03:49.160 --> 03:51.920]  We have all decided that it is impressive smoke.
[03:51.920 --> 03:54.680]  So I said I wasn't going to ramble, but I'm doing that.
[03:54.680 --> 03:59.160]  So let's jump into my report about a strain called The Machine.
[03:59.160 --> 04:01.200]  The parents of The Machine.
[04:01.880 --> 04:06.000]  Marco Esco Andoles asked if, let me see, there was a specific question.
[04:06.000 --> 04:07.640]  Which Chemdela Chem is it?
[04:07.640 --> 04:11.920]  The parents of The Machine are Chemdela Chem cross to Arise.
[04:11.920 --> 04:16.840]  To the best of my knowledge, the Chemdela Chem came from Top Dog Genetics and that is
[04:16.840 --> 04:19.100]  where I believe this one came from.
[04:19.100 --> 04:23.320]  This was given to me as a clone by a friend who sprouted the seed.
[04:23.320 --> 04:25.440]  Big shout out to my friend, you know who you are.
[04:25.440 --> 04:27.200]  But this clone really stood out in my garden.
[04:27.200 --> 04:28.640]  We'll talk about that more in a little bit.
[04:28.640 --> 04:30.640]  But this is the Chemdela Chem.
[04:30.640 --> 04:36.080]  Chemdela Chem was Chemd to I-95, or it is Chemd to I-95.
[04:36.080 --> 04:37.400]  I don't guess it changed.
[04:37.400 --> 04:38.600]  That is the Chemdela Chem.
[04:38.600 --> 04:40.000]  Chemd to I-95.
[04:40.000 --> 04:42.760]  I love it because it just stinks.
[04:42.760 --> 04:44.400]  It's got such good stink to it.
[04:44.400 --> 04:49.440]  That Chemdela Chem brings that old school skunky with the new school diesel funk with
[04:49.440 --> 04:55.520]  that really crazy chem flavor and the buzz to it is beautiful and it grows like a savage
[04:55.520 --> 04:57.080]  and it's very photogenic.
[04:57.080 --> 05:00.200]  That's something else I should talk about, which did transfer into the machine.
[05:00.200 --> 05:05.120]  All right, so that's the Chemdela Chem, which was the female plant used in this cross.
[05:05.120 --> 05:07.360]  That is the mother plant that got pollinated.
[05:07.360 --> 05:11.540]  On the male side, we do have the arise, also known as King Solomon.
[05:11.540 --> 05:16.260]  My King Solomon is a beautiful specimen of a male.
[05:16.260 --> 05:18.680]  I was going to say a stud is the word that left my brain there.
[05:18.680 --> 05:22.040]  A stud of a male plant of an arise cut.
[05:22.040 --> 05:24.840]  It's just an arise male that I have named King Solomon.
[05:24.840 --> 05:28.040]  He's just got his own specific name because he has such a stud.
[05:28.040 --> 05:33.240]  All of the female arise plants get labeled arise and then a number, arise F2 number two,
[05:33.240 --> 05:36.720]  arise F1 number four, things like that sit around in the garden.
[05:36.720 --> 05:40.240]  But the arise male, he is simply named King Solomon.
[05:40.240 --> 05:43.940]  So the King Solomon, arise is golden goat and daybreaker.
[05:43.940 --> 05:47.640]  That was a golden goat female pollinated by a daybreaker male.
[05:47.640 --> 05:49.680]  My arise is fairly well known.
[05:49.680 --> 05:52.560]  There's a lot of info on the internet, a lot of pictures.
[05:52.560 --> 05:55.920]  It is well known for producing a very high THC.
[05:55.920 --> 05:58.220]  The offspring come out with very high THC.
[05:58.220 --> 06:03.440]  Almost anything I pollinate with that King Solomon will come out with extreme potency,
[06:03.440 --> 06:08.760]  almost like panic attack potency, almost like freak you out, psychedelic, almost type potency.
[06:08.760 --> 06:10.640]  It's really, I call it the fixer plant.
[06:10.640 --> 06:13.700]  King Solomon likes to fix and improve everything.
[06:13.700 --> 06:17.200]  Also it's known for making plants grow with what we call hyper vigor.
[06:17.200 --> 06:19.280]  It makes them grow very, very quickly.
[06:19.280 --> 06:22.200]  They get big plants that root quite well.
[06:22.200 --> 06:23.200]  That is King Solomon.
[06:23.200 --> 06:24.200]  That is arise.
[06:24.200 --> 06:25.200]  All right, we know the parents.
[06:25.200 --> 06:28.880]  Now let's talk a little bit about how the parents grow and then we'll segue into how
[06:28.880 --> 06:31.560]  the cross itself grows.
[06:31.560 --> 06:36.080]  The chemdelechem, it gets a little bit tall and kind of lanky, but it turns into what
[06:36.080 --> 06:40.320]  I call just spears of nasty dank.
[06:40.320 --> 06:45.480]  It's just long, thick buds with beautiful colors, beautiful aromas, lots of trichomes,
[06:45.480 --> 06:48.100]  and it just smells nasty delicious.
[06:48.100 --> 06:52.480]  If it wasn't cannabis, you would make it go far away if it smelled like that.
[06:52.480 --> 06:55.780]  Anything else that smelled like that, you would put it in two or three bags and seal
[06:55.780 --> 06:57.280]  it up and get rid of it.
[06:57.280 --> 06:59.060]  Maybe burn it with fire, maybe destroy it.
[06:59.060 --> 07:03.340]  But since it's cannabis, it is such a tremendously desirable smell.
[07:03.340 --> 07:04.340]  I love it.
[07:04.340 --> 07:05.340]  I can't get enough.
[07:05.340 --> 07:06.340]  It's like, ooh, that stinks.
[07:06.340 --> 07:07.340]  I want to smell it again.
[07:07.340 --> 07:08.340]  Oh, that stinks so bad.
[07:08.340 --> 07:09.340]  I want to smell it again.
[07:09.340 --> 07:12.540]  And when you smoke it, people around you, they go, damn, that weed stinks.
[07:12.540 --> 07:13.540]  Can I get an eighth?
[07:13.540 --> 07:16.780]  Like they want some of it immediately because it smells so good.
[07:16.780 --> 07:18.220]  So that is the Chemdela Chem.
[07:18.220 --> 07:23.540]  Gets a little bit tall, kind of lanky, but just fucking gassy and delicious.
[07:23.540 --> 07:25.500]  Then the Arise, I mentioned that one.
[07:25.500 --> 07:29.900]  Hyper vigor, hyper potency, super fast growing plant.
[07:29.900 --> 07:31.860]  So that's what we're going to talk about, about the parents.
[07:31.860 --> 07:35.200]  Now why did I want to make this cross?
[07:35.200 --> 07:38.580]  Because I love that Chemdela Chem skunk, gassy funk.
[07:38.580 --> 07:41.020]  I don't have enough of that in my lineup.
[07:41.020 --> 07:45.460]  It's something I'm really, it feels like we go in circles with the flavors of cannabis
[07:45.460 --> 07:46.460]  that are desired.
[07:46.460 --> 07:50.340]  For a while there, it was nothing but skunk and then it turned into diesel and then it
[07:50.340 --> 07:54.220]  turned into, Kush was popular in the Denver area.
[07:54.220 --> 07:59.940]  And then everybody wanted Chem and then everybody wanted garlic and then everybody wanted candy.
[07:59.940 --> 08:05.900]  Then cookies was popular and then garlic came around and now it's all the dessert strains,
[08:05.900 --> 08:09.420]  the fruity flavored candy dessert stuff is what's popular now.
[08:09.420 --> 08:14.140]  Like if you got a fruit flavor and a dessert in your name, like watermelon gelato or something,
[08:14.140 --> 08:16.140]  that shit's what everybody wants right now.
[08:16.140 --> 08:20.540]  So I feel like my terp wheel is coming back around to liking that skunky diesel-y stuff
[08:20.540 --> 08:25.540]  that I used to like, probably around 98, 99, early 2000s.
[08:25.540 --> 08:26.900]  That's what was real popular.
[08:26.900 --> 08:28.300]  So I'm coming back around to liking that.
[08:28.300 --> 08:29.820]  I wanted more of that in my lineup.
[08:29.820 --> 08:30.820]  I'm trying not to ramble too much.
[08:30.820 --> 08:32.740]  We're going to get me back on track.
[08:32.740 --> 08:35.940]  So I really love the flavors and aromas of the Chemdela Chem.
[08:35.940 --> 08:40.120]  Also I really, I like JJ as a breeder and that's where this cross came from.
[08:40.120 --> 08:42.300]  So I wanted to do some breeding with some of his stuff.
[08:42.980 --> 08:47.980]  You got to breed with the people, work with the people that you respect and appreciate.
[08:47.980 --> 08:49.660]  So that's mostly why I made it.
[08:49.660 --> 08:55.020]  And I knew that that growth that comes from the Arise and the potency from the Arise with
[08:55.020 --> 08:59.860]  that skunky funkiness, it was just like putting two supermodels in a room together, knowing
[08:59.860 --> 09:01.980]  that I'm just going to make a super, super model.
[09:01.980 --> 09:03.400]  I knew it was going to work well.
[09:03.400 --> 09:05.200]  So that's basically why I made the cross.
[09:05.200 --> 09:09.660]  As a breeder, as a grower, as a smoker, I felt like all the right ingredients were there.
[09:09.660 --> 09:12.680]  If I put those together, it was going to work very well.
[09:12.680 --> 09:14.660]  And I feel like we did reach our goal.
[09:14.660 --> 09:16.540]  We'll talk more about that in the future.
[09:16.540 --> 09:20.700]  Now let's talk about why I named this cross, The Machine.
[09:20.700 --> 09:26.420]  A lot of it came from, excuse me, a lot of it came from the flavors and aromas that come
[09:26.420 --> 09:28.220]  from this finished plant.
[09:28.220 --> 09:33.600]  It's got chemicals and greasy smells and funky stuff, kind of machine shop sort of smells.
[09:33.600 --> 09:38.440]  But also I named it The Machine in honor of Bert Kreischer.
[09:38.440 --> 09:41.120]  If you know me at all, you know that I'm a huge comedy nerd.
[09:41.120 --> 09:42.680]  I love going to comedy shows.
[09:42.680 --> 09:44.040]  I love watching comedy shows.
[09:44.040 --> 09:47.240]  I listen to podcasts all day constantly when I work.
[09:47.240 --> 09:48.880]  I'm a huge fan of laughter.
[09:48.880 --> 09:53.200]  One of the people that makes me laugh the most is motherfucking Brent Kreischler.
[09:53.200 --> 09:54.720]  That dude will make you laugh.
[09:54.720 --> 09:55.760]  Make me laugh my ass off.
[09:55.760 --> 09:57.080]  I could be working hard.
[09:57.080 --> 09:58.080]  I could be in a funky mood.
[09:58.080 --> 10:02.120]  It could be early in the morning and Bert Kreischler will say something ridiculous on
[10:02.120 --> 10:05.360]  a podcast and I will laugh until I have to go take a piss.
[10:05.760 --> 10:10.360]  I had to make a strain named after my friend Bert Kirschner just because I felt like it
[10:10.360 --> 10:11.360]  was appropriate.
[10:11.360 --> 10:14.000]  So it is named after Bert Kirschner.
[10:14.000 --> 10:15.280]  I'm trolling his name.
[10:15.280 --> 10:17.040]  It is Bert Kreischer, ladies and gentlemen.
[10:17.040 --> 10:18.920]  The strain is named after Bert Kreischer.
[10:18.920 --> 10:23.760]  I've been naming strains after Grateful Dead songs, after reggae artists, after mystical
[10:23.760 --> 10:25.760]  things and motivational things.
[10:25.760 --> 10:27.720]  I love comedy and I love laughter.
[10:27.720 --> 10:31.560]  So I decided it was time to name a strain after one of my favorite comedians.
[10:31.560 --> 10:34.600]  So Bert Kreischer, got a strain named after him.
[10:34.600 --> 10:39.160]  The Machine comes from a long story that Bert tells in one of his specials and it is
[10:39.160 --> 10:42.400]  about how, I don't want to ruin his joke, but if you haven't heard it by now, I don't
[10:42.400 --> 10:44.280]  know where you have been.
[10:44.280 --> 10:46.560]  Bert Kreischer learns Russian in college.
[10:46.560 --> 10:50.480]  He doesn't learn Russian at all, but he gets to go on a free trip to Russia.
[10:50.480 --> 10:55.600]  He becomes involved in the Russian mafia and he tells them that he is the machine and it's
[10:55.600 --> 10:56.600]  a hit.
[10:56.600 --> 10:57.600]  So that is where it comes from.
[10:57.600 --> 11:01.320]  It comes from the I am the Machine joke from Brent Kirschner.
[11:01.320 --> 11:02.720]  That is where the name comes from.
[11:02.800 --> 11:05.160]  I've rambled for a long time about that.
[11:05.160 --> 11:07.720]  Let's talk about the actual strain.
[11:07.720 --> 11:09.680]  Big shout out to Bert Kreischer, by the way.
[11:09.680 --> 11:11.880]  That dude has made me laugh a lot.
[11:11.880 --> 11:13.440]  The flowering time.
[11:13.440 --> 11:14.480]  So we've talked about the cross.
[11:14.480 --> 11:15.480]  We've talked about the parents.
[11:15.480 --> 11:18.440]  A lot of people are going to want to know the flowering time of this strain.
[11:18.440 --> 11:20.120]  Let's get back into grower mode here.
[11:20.120 --> 11:22.400]  The flowering time of the machine.
[11:22.400 --> 11:26.320]  Most phenotypes will finish within 63 to 70 days.
[11:26.320 --> 11:29.040]  Some of them, maybe let them go about 72 days.
[11:29.040 --> 11:35.880]  Super chem heavy, gassy, stanky ones, maybe 72 days, but 60 to 70 days is the prime zone.
[11:35.880 --> 11:42.560]  About 63, 65 days is where most of the phenotypes are going to be finished.
[11:42.560 --> 11:43.560]  Aromas and flavors.
[11:43.560 --> 11:45.200]  I've talked about this a little bit.
[11:45.200 --> 11:47.720]  This is part of why it got the name, the machine.
[11:47.720 --> 11:48.960]  There are chemical flavors.
[11:48.960 --> 11:49.960]  There are chemical smells.
[11:49.960 --> 11:51.800]  There are gassy smells.
[11:51.800 --> 11:57.280]  Sometimes there's a hint of like lemon fuel, but it's mostly chemicals, gassy, funky dirtiness.
[11:57.320 --> 12:02.280]  There's hints of coffee, some lower notes in there, but a lot of chemically, machine
[12:02.280 --> 12:04.360]  shop, greasy kind of smells.
[12:04.360 --> 12:07.680]  It's really kind of overwhelming, honestly, sometimes some phenotypes.
[12:07.680 --> 12:11.260]  It'll make your eyes kind of itchy, kind of burny when you're trimming it.
[12:11.260 --> 12:13.720]  Let's talk about growth shapes and structures.
[12:13.720 --> 12:17.660]  A lot of people growing this are going to want to know what to expect.
[12:17.660 --> 12:22.080]  Most of the phenotypes are going to make long branches.
[12:22.080 --> 12:27.520]  There are what I call the chem and the cush phenotypes, which are usually pretty identifiable.
[12:27.520 --> 12:30.760]  If you've grown any chem, you know that it kind of stays a little bit tighter.
[12:30.760 --> 12:32.720]  It makes those long spear type nuggets.
[12:32.720 --> 12:36.880]  If you've grown cush, you know it makes kind of more like popcorn balls and kind of stretchier
[12:36.880 --> 12:37.880]  plants.
[12:37.880 --> 12:39.360]  So let's talk a little bit about that.
[12:39.360 --> 12:42.760]  The chem, it is spears and tighter nodes.
[12:42.760 --> 12:47.260]  And earlier in flower, it's got a nasty berries sort of a smell.
[12:47.260 --> 12:52.460]  It's like dirty, funky smells, like rotten putrid stuff and berries at the same time,
[12:52.460 --> 12:56.640]  which later turns into a skunky, gassy kind of a thing when you dry it and cure it.
[12:56.640 --> 13:00.260]  That is the chem dominant phenotype.
[13:00.260 --> 13:04.820]  That one, in my opinion, it smells like the old school, original chem 91.
[13:04.820 --> 13:08.260]  So that is the chem dominant phenotype.
[13:08.260 --> 13:10.200]  There is a cush dominant phenotype.
[13:10.200 --> 13:12.060]  Like I said before, it's got longer branches.
[13:12.060 --> 13:16.780]  If you've ever grown cush, you know that some of the older, old school OG cush, it just
[13:16.780 --> 13:17.780]  gets real branchy.
[13:17.780 --> 13:21.700]  And then when you flower it, all those branches kind of fill in with big popcorn ball nugs
[13:21.700 --> 13:23.940]  on the top, makes a big glory bud.
[13:23.940 --> 13:27.340]  That's kind of what the cush dominant phenotype does.
[13:27.340 --> 13:32.880]  The cush phenotype will be earthy and just earthy and dirtier in aromas.
[13:32.880 --> 13:35.780]  It's going to be not as berries, not as gassy, more earthy.
[13:35.780 --> 13:37.100]  You're going to get an earthy, dirty thing.
[13:37.100 --> 13:38.100]  I keep saying earthy.
[13:38.100 --> 13:39.980]  I hope I've made that point clear.
[13:39.980 --> 13:44.620]  That one is going to be more chill, more indica dominant buzz, more put you in the couch,
[13:44.620 --> 13:45.940]  more knock you out.
[13:46.100 --> 13:47.940]  That one's got big fat, wider leaves.
[13:47.940 --> 13:50.100]  You will notice that phenotype.
[13:50.100 --> 13:52.520]  The chem is gassier and nasty.
[13:52.520 --> 13:56.620]  And also I wrote down a head killer, the chem dominant phenotype.
[13:56.620 --> 14:00.980]  The buzz will make you forget where you were and what you're doing while you were doing
[14:00.980 --> 14:01.980]  it.
[14:01.980 --> 14:05.220]  You'll be walking to the fridge to get a drink and you'll forget that you needed a drink
[14:05.220 --> 14:09.840]  until you realize you're so thirsty that your mouth is stuck to your face.
[14:09.840 --> 14:14.940]  Most of these phenotypes come out distinctly chem or distinctly cush, and it is very noticeable.
[14:14.940 --> 14:20.180]  Very few of them show much of the golden goat trait other than the fast growth and
[14:20.180 --> 14:21.180]  the high potency.
[14:21.180 --> 14:24.340]  I think a lot of that is attributed to by the golden goat.
[14:24.340 --> 14:29.420]  So you're getting the aromas and flavors of the cushion chem and the speed of the growth
[14:29.420 --> 14:33.380]  and that high potency is kicking in from that tropical part of the sativa.
[14:33.380 --> 14:34.660]  That's where I think that comes in.
[14:34.660 --> 14:40.380]  But you're going to find very heavy cush phenotypes and very heavy chem phenotypes and then things
[14:40.380 --> 14:41.380]  right in the middle.
[14:41.380 --> 14:44.420]  So you'll be able to find something that's got the amount of couch lock you want, the
[14:44.420 --> 14:47.860]  amount of head buzz you like, and then that right in the middle, beautiful buzz that I
[14:47.860 --> 14:48.860]  really enjoy.
[14:48.860 --> 14:52.240]  The kind of sits you down and makes you think all you can do is just sit there and ponder
[14:52.240 --> 14:56.300]  life for a little bit or end up staring at a painting and seeing a totally different
[14:56.300 --> 14:58.900]  painting in that painting that you've never seen before.
[14:58.900 --> 15:00.940]  That's the kind of herb that this is here.
[15:00.940 --> 15:05.520]  You got the gassy, the chemi, the cushy and the potency of that tropical stuff.
[15:05.520 --> 15:10.940]  Now within these ranges of cushion chem, I do find what I believe to be three, not distinct
[15:10.940 --> 15:14.380]  phenotypes but basically categories of phenotypes.
[15:14.380 --> 15:17.620]  There are probably several phenotypes that will pop up.
[15:17.620 --> 15:19.060]  This is an F1 hybrid.
[15:19.060 --> 15:24.900]  I do enjoy the variation, but there are three categories of phenotypes that I have distinctly
[15:24.900 --> 15:25.900]  identified.
[15:25.900 --> 15:27.820]  Let's talk about those three categories.
[15:27.820 --> 15:35.020]  There is what I call the pine cone category, which that one is the cush, OG cush type of
[15:35.020 --> 15:36.020]  category.
[15:36.020 --> 15:37.980]  It's going to smell more musty, more earthy.
[15:37.980 --> 15:42.060]  You're going to get your coffee, your chocolate, your indica dominant phenotypes are going
[15:42.060 --> 15:43.060]  to be that one.
[15:43.060 --> 15:47.460]  You're going to get more pine cone size and shape buds, more jaggedy buds.
[15:47.460 --> 15:50.980]  They're going to be your pine cone size and shape buds all over the plant, not as big
[15:50.980 --> 15:51.980]  long spears.
[15:51.980 --> 15:55.540]  I only say that because there is another phenotype called the spear, which we'll talk about in
[15:55.540 --> 16:01.500]  a minute, but these pine cone shape buds are going to be the gassy musty flavors and aromas,
[16:01.500 --> 16:03.560]  your cushy type varieties.
[16:03.560 --> 16:06.180]  Like I said a moment ago, your bigger leaf varieties.
[16:06.180 --> 16:08.340]  These are going to be what I call the pine cone phenotype.
[16:08.340 --> 16:10.660]  That is going to be OG cush dominant.
[16:10.660 --> 16:14.660]  Then there is what I call the foxtail phenotype.
[16:14.660 --> 16:18.820]  There are some phenotypes within this line that just simply produce foxtails.
[16:18.820 --> 16:22.100]  That comes from the ChemD and the genetics.
[16:22.100 --> 16:25.700]  We don't see that a lot pop up in the chem, but things that are made with the chem do
[16:25.700 --> 16:26.700]  make that trait.
[16:26.700 --> 16:28.100]  We see that in the GMO.
[16:28.100 --> 16:30.300]  I've seen it in some other chem crosses.
[16:30.300 --> 16:32.860]  That is not your fault, possibly not your fault.
[16:32.860 --> 16:35.100]  That very well could be from the genetics.
[16:35.100 --> 16:37.860]  If you get minimal foxtailing, it's not crazy.
[16:37.860 --> 16:42.660]  We just see some bulbous calyxes, little extra bulbous, what do we want to call them?
[16:42.660 --> 16:43.660]  Bracks.
[16:43.660 --> 16:44.660]  They swell a little bit more.
[16:44.660 --> 16:46.720]  They stack up a little bit harder than you're used to.
[16:46.720 --> 16:48.340]  That is just a trait from the chem.
[16:48.340 --> 16:50.300]  You're not doing anything wrong.
[16:50.300 --> 16:55.060]  Then there is another very distinct, maybe a phenotype, maybe a category of phenotypes,
[16:55.060 --> 16:57.260]  which I call the spears.
[16:57.260 --> 17:00.500]  These are the stinky chem dominant phenotypes.
[17:00.500 --> 17:02.420]  They're just long spears of bud.
[17:02.420 --> 17:05.040]  They get a silvery sort of a tint to them.
[17:05.040 --> 17:08.520]  Maybe a purple hue with silver trichomes up and down them.
[17:08.520 --> 17:09.680]  They look velvety.
[17:09.680 --> 17:10.880]  They are beautiful plants.
[17:10.880 --> 17:14.480]  They stink like skunk and gas and chemicals.
[17:14.480 --> 17:16.800]  Those are the three distinct phenotypes.
[17:16.800 --> 17:19.000]  The pine cone is the gassy one.
[17:19.000 --> 17:21.920]  The spears is that chem dominant one.
[17:21.920 --> 17:25.720]  The foxtails is very potent and seems to kind of be the blend.
[17:25.720 --> 17:30.280]  You got that chem in there and then it's got the chem from the structure.
[17:30.280 --> 17:34.000]  It's got that cushy flavor and aroma, beautiful blend of both.
[17:34.000 --> 17:38.280]  If you're looking for more of a head buzz, you want the one with the long spear buds
[17:38.280 --> 17:39.280]  and the longer leaves.
[17:39.280 --> 17:43.240]  If you want to sit down on your ass and be knocked out, get that fat leaf one.
[17:43.240 --> 17:46.720]  If you're looking for that beautiful blend with all the beautiful turps, you might want
[17:46.720 --> 17:49.040]  that foxtail phenotype.
[17:49.040 --> 17:52.200]  Now if you're looking at my social media and watching the photos, you'll see that Zozo
[17:52.200 --> 17:57.220]  J got one of the plants that I may actually consider that foxtail phenotype.
[17:57.220 --> 18:02.020]  It's not extreme foxtails, but you'll see what I mean by the bulbous calyxes, the swollen
[18:02.020 --> 18:03.020]  bracts all over.
[18:03.040 --> 18:07.740]  It's a beautiful plant, but it did do a little foxtailing that was not Zozo J's fault.
[18:07.740 --> 18:10.380]  That is simply attributed to the genetics.
[18:10.380 --> 18:15.820]  Then if you look at a lot of the plants that Mobius grows on Instagram, he got the chem
[18:15.820 --> 18:19.780]  and the cush dominant phenotypes and posted a lot of pictures of both of them.
[18:19.780 --> 18:24.560]  The one with no leaves, that is the cush dominant phenotype and the one with a lot of leaves,
[18:24.560 --> 18:26.220]  that is more chem dominant.
[18:26.220 --> 18:31.020]  I can tell by looking, I can almost imagine and predict the aromas of the two phenotypes
[18:31.060 --> 18:33.580]  I saw from Mobius just by looking at the photos.
[18:33.580 --> 18:36.500]  All right, I'm going to check out my notes, see where we are here.
[18:36.500 --> 18:41.540]  All right, now we're to the part of the notes where it says tips and tricks and details.
[18:41.540 --> 18:45.660]  This is where we're going to give the breeder nuances, the breeder tips and tricks on how
[18:45.660 --> 18:49.740]  to maximize the potential of the machine.
[18:49.740 --> 18:52.260]  This one is a very fast vegging plant.
[18:52.260 --> 18:55.360]  A lot of my plants grow very fast all the way through their life.
[18:55.360 --> 18:57.940]  This one grows very, very quickly and veg.
[18:57.940 --> 19:01.900]  However, it does slow down when you flip it into flower.
[19:01.900 --> 19:04.380]  That is quite the opposite of a lot of plants.
[19:04.380 --> 19:06.660]  They usually do go a lot faster.
[19:06.660 --> 19:09.140]  This one will kind of slow down, so you don't have to worry.
[19:09.140 --> 19:11.960]  You do have to worry about the stretch, but it is not as extreme.
[19:11.960 --> 19:16.020]  It will probably double in size by the time you are done flowering.
[19:16.020 --> 19:19.700]  So if you've got six foot of flowering space, flower it at three feet.
[19:19.700 --> 19:23.340]  Of course, allow for light space and whatnot, but you understand what I'm saying.
[19:23.340 --> 19:26.580]  Your three foot tall plant will be six feet tall by the time it's done.
[19:26.580 --> 19:30.460]  If it's two feet tall, expect four feet by the time your plant finishes.
[19:30.460 --> 19:35.100]  A lot of the test growers did report that these plants do take a lot of nutrients.
[19:35.100 --> 19:39.340]  They will suck up a lot of nitrogen and veg because they do grow quite quickly and they
[19:39.340 --> 19:43.220]  do continue to eat a lot of nutrients throughout the flowering phase.
[19:43.220 --> 19:44.820]  So feed these plants heavy.
[19:44.820 --> 19:47.740]  Do pay very close attention to your plants.
[19:47.740 --> 19:51.940]  If they show you any signs of deficiency or signs of burn, adjust accordingly.
[19:51.940 --> 19:56.300]  But we do have reports that they eat a lot, so I can warn you to feed them heavy from
[19:56.340 --> 19:57.340]  the beginning.
[19:57.340 --> 20:02.820]  Also, myself and a lot of test growers noticed that these plants do tend to like it a little
[20:02.820 --> 20:03.820]  bit drier.
[20:03.820 --> 20:06.680]  You don't need to water these plants as frequently as heavily.
[20:06.680 --> 20:12.420]  You can let them get a little bit drier, which is often the case with most cush dominant
[20:12.420 --> 20:13.420]  varietals.
[20:13.420 --> 20:18.780]  Things from the cush line, the OG cushes, the old cush stuff, the Tahoe, the SFV, that
[20:18.780 --> 20:21.100]  stuff does better when you let it dry out.
[20:21.100 --> 20:24.800]  You're more likely to drown a cush plant than you are to let it dry.
[20:24.800 --> 20:32.160]  So if you've got a cush dominant phenotype, those plants will like much drier conditions.
[20:32.160 --> 20:35.920]  As you lean more toward the chem dominant phenotypes, they may want a little bit more,
[20:35.920 --> 20:40.480]  but we did notice that they do tend to like it a little bit drier, which if you're growing
[20:40.480 --> 20:45.920]  a lot of OG cush stuff, that is a trait that the OG cush, it's very common across the entire
[20:45.920 --> 20:46.920]  cush family.
[20:46.920 --> 20:51.720]  All right, so it does also, this is also a trait that is very common across the cush
[20:51.720 --> 20:52.720]  family.
[20:52.720 --> 20:55.000]  These plants will eat a lot of cow mag.
[20:55.000 --> 20:58.840]  If you feed them cow mag, you'll see the leaves give you big fat serrations.
[20:58.840 --> 21:00.400]  The leaves will get bold and strong.
[21:00.400 --> 21:03.140]  Don't overdo it, but they do like cow mag.
[21:03.140 --> 21:08.280]  They will get cow mag, calcium deficient, in mid flower if you don't feed them enough
[21:08.280 --> 21:09.280]  calcium.
[21:09.280 --> 21:11.260]  I know I say cow mag all the time together.
[21:11.260 --> 21:12.480]  Usually they're sold in the same bottle.
[21:12.480 --> 21:14.340]  I try to keep it easy for everybody.
[21:14.340 --> 21:17.760]  They're going to get calcium deficient is the one that you're going to see.
[21:17.800 --> 21:23.360]  I've also learned that feeding cush and chem plants kelp products or kelp really do increase
[21:23.360 --> 21:30.980]  the potency and that stanky aroma, that skunky, gassy, cushy, earthy shit that is really enhanced,
[21:30.980 --> 21:36.360]  in my opinion, in my experience, by feeding a good kelp product in flower.
[21:36.360 --> 21:40.760]  So if you can add some kelp products, that will really add to your stankiness.
[21:40.760 --> 21:43.840]  Now let's talk a little bit about the growth of these plants.
[21:43.840 --> 21:47.120]  I did mention that the chem de la chem does like to get tall.
[21:47.280 --> 21:49.160]  It likes to grow long branches.
[21:49.160 --> 21:53.040]  The arise does like to make big, tall, fast growing plants.
[21:53.040 --> 21:58.120]  So I do recommend trellising or tomato cages or some sort of supports for these plants.
[21:58.120 --> 22:00.320]  These plants will trellis very well.
[22:00.320 --> 22:01.400]  They pop and twist well.
[22:01.400 --> 22:03.000]  They spread out very well.
[22:03.000 --> 22:06.600]  When you spread them and bend them, it just makes more shoots and those grow up as well.
[22:06.600 --> 22:09.520]  I do recommend supports early.
[22:09.520 --> 22:15.080]  I would trellis them out in veg, have that trellis all set up or have your tomato cages
[22:15.240 --> 22:19.680]  or your sticks ready because when those buds start setting in, they're going to get top heavy.
[22:19.680 --> 22:21.520]  You're going to fill up big spears of buds.
[22:21.520 --> 22:23.080]  They're going to start toppling over.
[22:23.080 --> 22:24.520]  You're going to get sticky and stanky.
[22:24.520 --> 22:29.680]  It's going to be a pain in the ass if you don't start getting them supported ahead.
[22:29.680 --> 22:35.200]  Talking about supporting our plants, these plants really bulk up in the last two weeks of flower.
[22:35.200 --> 22:40.320]  Myself and all of the test growers really mentioned and really noticed that these plants
[22:40.320 --> 22:42.880]  beef up and bulk up the last two weeks of flower.
[22:42.880 --> 22:45.920]  That's why I recommend you let them go the 70, maybe 72 days.
[22:45.920 --> 22:51.040]  The first time you grow them, let them go and see what they do that last 10, 14 days.
[22:51.040 --> 22:54.440]  They really might expand, bulk up, beef up on you.
[22:54.440 --> 22:56.680]  You would hate to cut down at week nine and week 10.
[22:56.680 --> 23:01.640]  They really exploded and you wasted some growth on their wasted some weight that really could have helped you out.
[23:01.640 --> 23:03.040]  So let them finish.
[23:03.040 --> 23:05.920]  They really bulk up in the last two weeks.
[23:05.920 --> 23:09.920]  We did notice that temperature swings really make these plants colorful.
[23:09.920 --> 23:14.120]  These plants acted really, really well to cold temperatures during the night.
[23:14.120 --> 23:17.400]  We had some really drastic temperature swings here in Colorado.
[23:17.400 --> 23:21.600]  One of my test places was getting really hot during the day and really cold at night.
[23:21.600 --> 23:26.920]  Some of the plants, we'll talk about that one later, some of the plants did not like the cold at all.
[23:26.920 --> 23:31.400]  The machine really seemed to run well in the cold at night.
[23:31.400 --> 23:34.640]  It really brought out the colors, made the buds nice and dense.
[23:34.680 --> 23:41.400]  I really think it reacted, responded very well to those cold night temperatures toward the end of flower.
[23:41.400 --> 23:49.160]  The machine is now what I would call the gassiest and stankiest strain in my lineup that is now available.
[23:49.160 --> 23:55.240]  It compares very closely in stank and aroma to the Double Dose and also it would compete with the Dark Hollow.
[23:55.240 --> 23:58.200]  But it is now what I would call the gassiest in my lineup.
[23:58.200 --> 24:02.400]  That chem aroma, that chem stank, you just can't beat it.
[24:02.400 --> 24:07.120]  It's got, it just so skunky, stinky, it is gross in a delicious way.
[24:07.120 --> 24:07.960]  I said that earlier.
[24:07.960 --> 24:11.200]  It's like you smell it and you're like, that's gross.
[24:11.200 --> 24:12.520]  Can I smell it again?
[24:12.520 --> 24:15.640]  Just something disgustingly pleasing about it.
[24:15.640 --> 24:20.440]  That being said, I think it is best to have carbon filters.
[24:20.440 --> 24:28.560]  It is, I would recommend and over recommend and highly suggest again that you've got carbon filters and extra odor control.
[24:28.600 --> 24:32.440]  I said before, when you trim this one, when I trim this one, I don't trim a lot of plants.
[24:32.440 --> 24:33.520]  I grow little tiny plants.
[24:33.520 --> 24:34.800]  We did test runs.
[24:34.800 --> 24:41.160]  When we would crack open these plants to trim them, my eyes would get like, just it would, I'd feel like there was chemicals in my eyes.
[24:41.160 --> 24:42.280]  They would burn and they would itch.
[24:42.280 --> 24:45.120]  It was almost like I was allergic to it in a good way.
[24:45.120 --> 24:48.120]  When you crack open a bag, it makes my eyes itch.
[24:48.120 --> 24:52.640]  Like, it's almost like a, it's like a Pavlov effect, a Pavlovian.
[24:52.640 --> 24:55.880]  How do you, whatever Pavlov, shout out to that dude and his dogs.
[24:55.880 --> 24:56.920]  Pavlovian?
[24:56.920 --> 24:58.240]  I think that's how you say it.
[24:58.240 --> 24:59.280]  It's that sort of effect.
[24:59.280 --> 25:03.920]  When I would open up the jar, my eyes would itch and burn like it does when I smoke it.
[25:03.920 --> 25:08.600]  And I'm not saying itch and burn in a bad way, but it would get my eyes, my eyes would go heavy and droopy.
[25:08.600 --> 25:14.440]  And I think the smell would trigger my body and my eyes would just go, oh yeah, you're going to get that nice head buzz pretty soon here.
[25:14.440 --> 25:17.240]  But just trimming it made my eyes itch and burn.
[25:17.240 --> 25:20.120]  It is super gassy, super stanky.
[25:20.120 --> 25:27.240]  It will be, when you're trimming it, will be some of the most pungent, stankiest, offensive herb you ever experience.
[25:27.240 --> 25:29.560]  Offensive is the word I was looking for.
[25:29.560 --> 25:34.400]  One good thing to mention, these plants are very resistant to mold and mites.
[25:34.400 --> 25:35.920]  People grew this one outdoors.
[25:35.920 --> 25:38.680]  It did not get the mildew that a lot of people experienced.
[25:38.680 --> 25:42.400]  I have a good friend who got, they got some problematic bugs during their grow,
[25:42.400 --> 25:46.440]  and they said that this plant was basically left alone by some of their mites.
[25:46.440 --> 25:51.640]  So a lot of the testers did report that these plants were resistant to mildew and to bugs.
[25:51.640 --> 25:53.640]  We had a lot of people grow these outdoors.
[25:53.640 --> 25:55.840]  Nobody reported any powdery mildew.
[25:55.840 --> 25:57.760]  Nobody reported any bud rot.
[25:57.760 --> 26:00.800]  Also, I did have a friend who grew this in a room with mites.
[26:00.800 --> 26:02.680]  They did not get mites on this plant.
[26:02.680 --> 26:04.280]  So it is bug resistant.
[26:04.280 --> 26:05.600]  That is always a good thing.
[26:05.600 --> 26:10.960]  So we have learned that these plants are very resistant to bugs, very resistant to pathogens and mold.
[26:10.960 --> 26:14.760]  So knowing that these plants are resistant to pathogens, resistant to bugs,
[26:14.760 --> 26:19.360]  and they also grow super quickly, they smell really good, they're super photogenic,
[26:19.520 --> 26:23.760]  they come out with extremely high potency, they tolerate a lot of problems.
[26:23.760 --> 26:26.920]  I think that these plants would be great for beginner growers.
[26:26.920 --> 26:29.600]  The only thing I would really worry about is overwatering,
[26:29.600 --> 26:33.400]  but for people who may not be able to get to the grow as often,
[26:33.400 --> 26:37.240]  for people who aren't in there all day, for people who may forget to water,
[26:37.240 --> 26:39.000]  these may be great plants.
[26:39.000 --> 26:43.240]  Like I said, other than that, the opportunity to overwater these plants
[26:43.240 --> 26:44.920]  and the idea that they don't like as much water,
[26:44.920 --> 26:48.160]  these are great plants for beginner growers.
[26:48.160 --> 26:50.600]  Now let's talk a little bit about the smoke.
[26:50.600 --> 26:54.000]  I've gotten to smoke a few of the flowers from a couple of different grows.
[26:54.000 --> 26:59.560]  Something that I noticed is this cushy, chemmy, chemical, gassy aroma.
[26:59.560 --> 27:03.280]  When I hit it, it just feels like chemicals and cottonmouth coat my tongue.
[27:03.280 --> 27:08.360]  And when I exhale, that flavor and aroma just lingers and my eyes get heavy right away.
[27:08.360 --> 27:10.920]  And I can't get that smell off of my hands.
[27:10.920 --> 27:12.920]  I can wash my hands two or three times.
[27:12.920 --> 27:16.640]  And if you smoke a joint, if you break up a joint and smoke a joint of this weed,
[27:16.640 --> 27:19.880]  your fingers will smell like it for the rest of the weekend.
[27:19.880 --> 27:22.640]  This was also super thick smoke.
[27:22.640 --> 27:25.440]  I smoked two batches of flowers that made me say,
[27:25.440 --> 27:28.280]  that reminds me of back in the day when we used to say we got the chronic
[27:28.280 --> 27:30.640]  and the smoke expands in your lungs.
[27:30.640 --> 27:34.360]  This weed gave me that lung expandy feeling that I haven't had in a little bit.
[27:34.360 --> 27:36.960]  I smoke a lot of flowers, I smoke a lot of dabs,
[27:36.960 --> 27:40.400]  and there's just something in the lungs that I haven't felt in a long time.
[27:40.400 --> 27:43.400]  And I enjoyed it. It reminded me, like I said, of that old school,
[27:43.400 --> 27:44.920]  and we used to call it the chronic,
[27:44.920 --> 27:46.680]  that would expand in your lungs and you would smoke it.
[27:46.680 --> 27:49.800]  It kind of reminded me of that feeling.
[27:49.800 --> 27:52.080]  I did have a friend in Denver make some concentrates.
[27:52.080 --> 27:53.640]  I've got a friend, they are two friends.
[27:53.640 --> 27:55.040]  They're a lovely couple, big shout out.
[27:55.040 --> 27:56.560]  They do not want their name said on the show.
[27:56.560 --> 27:58.160]  They made that clear.
[27:58.160 --> 27:59.080]  They are a couple.
[27:59.080 --> 28:00.760]  They grow and make concentrates in Denver.
[28:00.760 --> 28:02.960]  They made some concentrates of the machine.
[28:02.960 --> 28:05.680]  I tried to smoke some before a podcast one night,
[28:05.680 --> 28:09.240]  and I do not remember writing, recording, editing, doing that show.
[28:09.240 --> 28:10.960]  It was all a blur.
[28:10.960 --> 28:13.240]  The concentrates from the machine,
[28:13.240 --> 28:15.840]  it is like the thing from the guys that men in black have.
[28:15.840 --> 28:17.800]  They go, blink, blink, and then your whole memory is gone.
[28:17.800 --> 28:19.000]  You don't know what happened.
[28:19.000 --> 28:20.920]  That is what this stuff is like.
[28:20.920 --> 28:22.520]  I just emptied my brain.
[28:22.520 --> 28:25.720]  I enjoyed it, but if you've got something to do,
[28:25.720 --> 28:27.840]  maybe if you've got something to do you don't want to do,
[28:27.840 --> 28:30.520]  this would be the perfect smoke for that because it made me,
[28:30.520 --> 28:32.680]  it just made my brain numb.
[28:32.680 --> 28:33.560]  I forgot everything.
[28:33.560 --> 28:36.880]  Also, after that, when I got done recording,
[28:36.880 --> 28:40.040]  while I was editing, I ate everything.
[28:40.040 --> 28:44.440]  It seems like when I smoke the machine, I get extreme munchies.
[28:44.440 --> 28:46.600]  So if you are, if you're a cancer patient,
[28:46.600 --> 28:48.400]  or if you've got a medicine or something
[28:48.400 --> 28:49.600]  that is stopping you from eating,
[28:49.600 --> 28:51.520]  if you need an increased appetite,
[28:51.520 --> 28:53.840]  the machine may be a great medical strain for you.
[28:53.840 --> 28:56.200]  It may help you out, may increase that appetite,
[28:56.200 --> 28:57.960]  may help you put some weight on,
[28:57.960 --> 29:00.120]  help you build bulk up for the winter here.
[29:00.120 --> 29:00.960]  Where am I?
[29:00.960 --> 29:03.080]  I'm looking for my notes here.
[29:03.080 --> 29:07.040]  Overall, this was an easy to grow strain and top quality.
[29:07.040 --> 29:08.240]  You can grow this one.
[29:08.240 --> 29:09.680]  If you're a beginner grower,
[29:10.320 --> 29:11.360]  as long as you don't overwater this plant,
[29:11.360 --> 29:13.440]  you can grow this and it looks like you grew something
[29:13.440 --> 29:15.960]  that should have been super challenging to grow.
[29:15.960 --> 29:19.080]  This is an easy plant to grow that will put out connoisseur smoke
[29:19.080 --> 29:20.720]  is a note that I wrote down.
[29:20.720 --> 29:22.320]  It handles overfeeding.
[29:22.320 --> 29:23.520]  It'll handle underfeeding,
[29:23.520 --> 29:24.960]  which you've got to pay attention to it.
[29:24.960 --> 29:26.640]  It'll come out better if you feed it properly.
[29:26.640 --> 29:28.080]  Every plant will.
[29:28.080 --> 29:29.720]  It handles temp swings well.
[29:29.720 --> 29:31.800]  It is super easy to trim.
[29:31.800 --> 29:33.160]  Big fat bag appeal.
[29:33.160 --> 29:36.400]  The nugs, the dried and cured nugs look beautiful.
[29:36.400 --> 29:39.080]  Big fat pine cones, big long spears,
[29:39.520 --> 29:42.920]  beautiful dark colors, beautiful layers of trichomes,
[29:42.920 --> 29:47.040]  super frosty, gross aromas, nice dense nugs.
[29:47.040 --> 29:49.800]  Lots of dense, dense nuggets come out of these crosses.
[29:49.800 --> 29:52.000]  I wrote down again, easy for beginners,
[29:52.000 --> 29:54.320]  low maintenance if you time it right.
[29:54.320 --> 29:56.920]  The biggest issue will be height and stank
[29:56.920 --> 29:59.760]  and something to look out for will be overwatering.
[29:59.760 --> 30:01.040]  You do have to time it correctly.
[30:01.040 --> 30:03.400]  Flower early if you were limited on space,
[30:03.400 --> 30:05.760]  flower early because this one's going to double
[30:05.760 --> 30:06.600]  in height on you.
[30:06.600 --> 30:08.920]  It's going to veg very, very quickly.
[30:09.760 --> 30:11.240]  Then it's going to flower and it will double in height.
[30:11.240 --> 30:13.680]  So make sure you are prepared for that.
[30:13.680 --> 30:15.580]  It's great plants for quick runs
[30:15.580 --> 30:19.160]  because it veges so quickly and is ready to flip early.
[30:19.160 --> 30:22.720]  Most of the time you may be veging for four to six weeks.
[30:22.720 --> 30:24.760]  You may want to cut that down and just plant on the four
[30:24.760 --> 30:26.260]  because they're going to go so quickly.
[30:26.260 --> 30:28.120]  It may save you a couple of weeks,
[30:28.120 --> 30:29.480]  which is always a good thing in a grow
[30:29.480 --> 30:32.120]  that gets more plants, more grows per year.
[30:32.120 --> 30:33.920]  It doesn't require a lot of attention.
[30:33.920 --> 30:35.760]  Get it supported, pull a few leaves,
[30:35.760 --> 30:36.960]  feed the shit out of it.
[30:36.960 --> 30:39.280]  And I wrote down, she will bang.
[30:39.280 --> 30:40.960]  So it's a pretty easy plant to grow.
[30:40.960 --> 30:43.260]  If you flip it early, don't get it too tall.
[30:43.260 --> 30:44.360]  If you do get her too tall,
[30:44.360 --> 30:46.440]  you could pop her, twist her, bend her,
[30:46.440 --> 30:47.800]  tie her down, do what you need to do.
[30:47.800 --> 30:49.680]  She takes very well to that sort of stuff.
[30:49.680 --> 30:51.720]  She does recover very quickly and very well
[30:51.720 --> 30:54.080]  from popping, topping and abuse.
[30:54.080 --> 30:56.280]  I think the machine is a great plant for quick runs
[30:56.280 --> 30:58.520]  because she veges super quickly.
[30:58.520 --> 31:00.480]  She flowers in about nine or 10 weeks,
[31:00.480 --> 31:02.580]  which is great for top quality product.
[31:02.580 --> 31:05.600]  I'm sure you can find a phenotype that is done in nine weeks
[31:05.600 --> 31:07.280]  that will suit your purposes.
[31:07.280 --> 31:08.560]  All right, I do have one more detail
[31:08.560 --> 31:10.400]  before I start wrapping up this show.
[31:10.400 --> 31:13.240]  If I were going to grow a run of the machine right now
[31:13.240 --> 31:14.920]  with what I know about her,
[31:14.920 --> 31:16.560]  with the experience I've got with this plant,
[31:16.560 --> 31:19.360]  the way that I would do it is I would probably run.
[31:19.360 --> 31:21.200]  So let me preface by saying a lot of people
[31:21.200 --> 31:23.560]  are probably growing in a five by five tent
[31:23.560 --> 31:26.560]  or something similar, maybe a small room.
[31:26.560 --> 31:29.400]  A lot of us don't have major high ceilings.
[31:29.400 --> 31:31.640]  We've got a little bit of space to work with.
[31:31.640 --> 31:33.800]  In a five by five tent or something similar,
[31:33.800 --> 31:35.840]  this is probably what I would do.
[31:35.840 --> 31:39.920]  I would probably do nine three gallon pots
[31:39.920 --> 31:42.640]  and I would veg them up until they are about 12
[31:42.640 --> 31:44.300]  to 18 inches tall.
[31:44.300 --> 31:46.040]  Then I would flower them.
[31:46.040 --> 31:49.380]  If you want to spread them out, if you want to trellis them,
[31:49.380 --> 31:53.800]  I would top them one time early, about 10 to 12 inches tall.
[31:53.800 --> 31:56.960]  As soon as they start branching, take a top out of them,
[31:56.960 --> 31:59.580]  then put the trellis net down and spread them out.
[31:59.580 --> 32:01.320]  Let that go for maybe a week
[32:01.320 --> 32:03.760]  because they're going to veg quickly into that trellis.
[32:04.600 --> 32:05.640]  Then flip them because they're going to grow tall
[32:05.640 --> 32:07.140]  and they're going to fill that area.
[32:07.140 --> 32:08.560]  So that's the way I would do it.
[32:08.560 --> 32:11.560]  Three, nine, three gallon pots,
[32:11.560 --> 32:14.280]  veg them until they're about 12 to 18 inches tall,
[32:14.280 --> 32:16.360]  then flip them and they will fill your space
[32:16.360 --> 32:19.840]  or veg them until they're about 10 or 12 inches tall,
[32:19.840 --> 32:22.900]  top them one time, spread them out with the trellis,
[32:22.900 --> 32:25.520]  let them fill that space, then flip them.
[32:25.520 --> 32:27.360]  I think you'll be satisfied with that.
[32:27.360 --> 32:29.840]  Maybe I would consider four or seven gallon pots
[32:29.840 --> 32:32.680]  in a five by five space, but as quickly as they veg,
[32:32.680 --> 32:34.440]  that may get out of control.
[32:34.440 --> 32:36.120]  They may outgrow your space more quickly
[32:36.120 --> 32:37.480]  than you were prepared for.
[32:37.480 --> 32:39.640]  But if I wanted to run a quick crop of these plants,
[32:39.640 --> 32:42.040]  the way that I would do it again would be nine,
[32:42.040 --> 32:44.440]  three gallon pots in a five by five,
[32:44.440 --> 32:47.220]  veg them until they're about 12 to 18 inches tall,
[32:47.220 --> 32:50.780]  then flower them, let them flower for nine to 10 weeks,
[32:50.780 --> 32:54.460]  maybe 72 days at the most, chop them, dry them, cure them.
[32:54.460 --> 32:58.880]  You've got a quick crop of top shelf product in my opinion.
[32:58.880 --> 33:00.480]  You guys, I wasn't sure if I was going to say this,
[33:00.480 --> 33:03.200]  but I think I enjoy the machine so much
[33:03.200 --> 33:06.360]  that it may become my new concert smoke.
[33:06.360 --> 33:09.160]  This may replace the Grateful Dog.
[33:09.160 --> 33:12.780]  The Grateful Dog has been my go-to choice for concert weed.
[33:13.800 --> 33:14.800]  This may replace that.
[33:14.800 --> 33:16.720]  We'll talk about the Grateful Dog in the future.
[33:16.720 --> 33:18.640]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps,
[33:18.640 --> 33:20.560]  hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers,
[33:20.560 --> 33:22.320]  clone cutters, pollen chuckers,
[33:22.320 --> 33:23.920]  all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts,
[33:23.920 --> 33:25.400]  I want to thank you once again for listening
[33:25.400 --> 33:28.100]  to another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[33:28.100 --> 33:30.680]  If you made it this far, it is time for me to announce
[33:30.680 --> 33:33.780]  that The Machine and Saka Souffle will be available
[33:33.780 --> 33:37.260]  at seedsherenow.com on the Black Friday sale.
[33:37.260 --> 33:39.300]  That does start November 25th.

[33:41.260 --> 33:42.740]  so make sure you check that out.

[33:53.540 --> 33:55.860]  of unreleased iRegenetics.
[33:55.860 --> 33:57.060]  What will it be?
[33:57.060 --> 33:57.900]  Who knows?
[33:57.900 --> 33:59.500]  I'll label the pack so that I know what it is.
[33:59.500 --> 34:00.940]  I can tell you in the future,
[34:00.940 --> 34:03.820]  but at this time it will be an unreleased pack
[34:03.820 --> 34:07.420]  with a secret code on it so you don't even know what it is.
[34:07.420 --> 34:11.080]  All right, seedsherenow.com on November 25th.
[34:11.080 --> 34:12.460]  All right, where was I?
[34:12.460 --> 34:13.900]  I was gonna wrap it up, right?
[34:13.900 --> 34:16.860]  Make sure you check out the website at iRegenetics.com.
[34:16.860 --> 34:18.540]  There will be a link to all of the seed vendors.

[34:40.240 --> 34:41.720]  with fresh new content.
[34:41.720 --> 34:44.560]  I wanna give a big shout out to my buddy, Mobius Grows,
[34:44.560 --> 34:47.280]  and until next time, take a fat dab
[34:47.280 --> 34:48.840]  and give your mom a hug for me.
