[00:00.000 --> 00:01.680]  Hey, what's up, podcast world?
[00:01.680 --> 00:05.680]  It is time for episode 427 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:05.680 --> 00:07.320]  No long fancy intro, no ads.
[00:07.320 --> 00:10.260]  We're not going to talk about what I'm smoking, no Patreon shout outs.
[00:10.260 --> 00:12.520]  We're going to get right down to business today.
[00:12.520 --> 00:16.600]  I am frequently a guest on a show called Embracing Organics.
[00:16.600 --> 00:22.320]  Embracing Organics is, of course, an organic-based cannabis growing podcast that is found on
[00:22.320 --> 00:23.320]  YouTube.
[00:23.320 --> 00:26.160]  We record the show on Thursdays at 7 p.m. Mountain Time.
[00:26.160 --> 00:27.920]  I encourage you to join us.
[00:27.920 --> 00:29.440]  I am on the show quite frequently.
[00:29.440 --> 00:32.960]  I like to talk about growing and I like to talk about breeding, but even when I'm not
[00:32.960 --> 00:36.720]  there, it is still a great podcast and the boys have a great time.
[00:36.720 --> 00:41.080]  On the most recent episode, I brought up a great topic that I wanted to cut from their
[00:41.080 --> 00:45.160]  show with their permission and replay here on my podcast.
[00:45.160 --> 00:49.120]  I don't feel like it requires a lot of setup because I do a pretty good explanation in
[00:49.120 --> 00:50.960]  the rant that I was delivering.
[00:50.960 --> 00:55.080]  I will also be back at the end of that recording to deliver some fresh information that I've
[00:55.080 --> 00:57.960]  discovered since that original recording.
[00:57.960 --> 01:02.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, with no further ado, let's time travel back to last Thursday and
[01:02.160 --> 01:07.640]  revisit my rant about Phyllos Bioscience on the Embracing Organics podcast.
[01:07.640 --> 01:14.520]  What is, uh, anybody got anything cool they want to talk about this week?
[01:14.520 --> 01:15.520]  Any cool topics?
[01:15.520 --> 01:21.280]  Well, I didn't want to jump right in, but since there's dead air silence, the thing
[01:21.280 --> 01:25.760]  that has been popular in the cannabis community that I haven't touched on yet seems to be
[01:25.840 --> 01:30.040]  the, uh, the Phyllos, uh, Galaxy news that has come to light lately.
[01:30.040 --> 01:31.040]  Sorry, I sound distracted.
[01:31.040 --> 01:32.040]  I'm getting a dab together.
[01:32.040 --> 01:33.040]  I need this dab.
[01:33.040 --> 01:34.040]  Go ahead.
[01:34.040 --> 01:39.360]  You get your dab together and you know, I'm kind of going to play a little devil's advocate
[01:39.360 --> 01:44.360]  here, but personally I haven't, dude, I haven't looked into anything about this Phyllos stuff.
[01:44.360 --> 01:49.120]  You know, as far as I know from what I've seen on Instagram and blah, blah, blah, blah,
[01:49.120 --> 01:51.840]  blah, people are claiming that they're stealing genetics.
[01:51.840 --> 01:55.400]  They're claiming that, you know, they're taking their stuff and heading for the high
[01:55.400 --> 01:56.560]  hills with it.
[01:56.560 --> 02:00.120]  I'm seeing a lot of like, you know, oh, Phyllos is doing this.
[02:00.120 --> 02:03.080]  Phyllos is doing that, but I haven't really dug anything up.
[02:03.080 --> 02:05.920]  I haven't got any of my own research.
[02:05.920 --> 02:09.680]  So you seem to know a little bit about what's going on.
[02:09.680 --> 02:12.200]  So go ahead and inform me.
[02:12.200 --> 02:17.760]  Well, uh, there's a lot to it and a lot of it, a lot of the reaction is kind of misinformation
[02:17.760 --> 02:20.760]  and uh, the cannabis industry loves a nice witch hunt.
[02:20.760 --> 02:22.040]  We love to hang someone out to dry.
[02:22.040 --> 02:26.400]  As soon as we hear somebody say something that ruffles our feathers, I tried not to
[02:26.400 --> 02:31.320]  get involved in that feather ruffling and tried to kind of wait and see how it unfolded.
[02:31.320 --> 02:37.120]  The big misconception that I see, people seem to think that Phyllos has our plants.
[02:37.120 --> 02:43.440]  They think that we sent them clones or small babies or something that they have made a
[02:43.440 --> 02:44.920]  tissue culture or a clone of.
[02:44.920 --> 02:45.920]  That is not the case.
[02:45.920 --> 02:46.920]  They do not have our plants.
[02:46.920 --> 02:50.560]  They have got our genetic data is basically what they have.
[02:51.360 --> 02:53.040]  When you send material to Phyllos, you don't send them a plant.
[02:53.040 --> 02:57.200]  You take a small card that unfolds, you rub part of the plant material in there to get
[02:57.200 --> 02:58.760]  the juices out of the plant.
[02:58.760 --> 03:02.120]  You fold it back up and you send it to them just the same way that you spit into a little
[03:02.120 --> 03:04.000]  package for 23andme.
[03:04.000 --> 03:05.000]  It is the same process.
[03:05.000 --> 03:10.080]  Uh, 23andme can't, they, maybe they could, but 23andme doesn't have my arm.
[03:10.080 --> 03:13.640]  I didn't have to send them part of my arm for them to get my, my DNA.
[03:13.640 --> 03:14.640]  You don't send them a plant.
[03:14.640 --> 03:16.560]  You send them just juices basically.
[03:16.560 --> 03:17.800]  So they don't have our plants.
[03:17.800 --> 03:22.960]  They can't regenerate our plants from the small amount of data we gave them.
[03:22.960 --> 03:28.280]  What they do have is the genetic marker of all of our plants.
[03:28.280 --> 03:31.040]  So now they know what makes up each plant.
[03:31.040 --> 03:32.840]  What they do have is an advantage.
[03:32.840 --> 03:37.720]  Now they have already seen basically what happens if you breed almost all of the popular
[03:37.720 --> 03:41.560]  cultivars that are out there, they've seen it bred to all of the other cultivars and
[03:41.560 --> 03:47.320]  they've got a really good predictive chart and a map and a kind of a cheat code in breeding.
[03:47.840 --> 03:50.960]  That's basically to my understanding what they have done.
[03:50.960 --> 03:56.880]  Their intention to my understanding is not to take our plants and reproduce them.
[03:56.880 --> 04:01.760]  They want to use the info that we have provided to breed better plants for the future, in
[04:01.760 --> 04:03.600]  their opinion, better plants for the future.
[04:03.600 --> 04:04.960]  I don't know how that is going to go.
[04:04.960 --> 04:08.960]  I can't speak for their intention there, but from what they have released, they don't have
[04:08.960 --> 04:09.960]  our stuff.
[04:09.960 --> 04:10.960]  They can't steal our stuff.
[04:10.960 --> 04:14.440]  They're going to use our data because we all sent them our plants with the agree.
[04:14.440 --> 04:17.960]  You sign an agreement saying that they can use your data.
[04:17.960 --> 04:19.700]  They can use it for science.
[04:19.700 --> 04:20.700]  They can reproduce it.
[04:20.700 --> 04:24.040]  There's a long list of things you allow them to do when you send them your material.
[04:24.040 --> 04:26.400]  So we gave them permission to do this.
[04:26.400 --> 04:31.660]  Also when you send a scientist or a laboratory, any sort of material, they're not storing
[04:31.660 --> 04:32.800]  it and doing you a favor.
[04:32.800 --> 04:33.880]  They're going to use that.
[04:33.880 --> 04:34.880]  That is part of their job.
[04:34.880 --> 04:35.960]  That is what science is for.
[04:35.960 --> 04:39.200]  You don't get into a science industry to just collect data.
[04:39.200 --> 04:40.860]  You want to do something with that data.
[04:40.860 --> 04:41.860]  So that's what they did.
[04:41.860 --> 04:43.480]  Now they're looking to breed with that.
[04:43.520 --> 04:46.240]  They're going to use our research.
[04:46.240 --> 04:48.400]  This is what is frustrating the community.
[04:48.400 --> 04:50.120]  We've spent years doing this.
[04:50.120 --> 04:54.800]  Somebody in the chat earlier said that they have done what a small family of breeders
[04:54.800 --> 04:56.680]  would have done in several years.
[04:56.680 --> 04:58.680]  They've got all of that data to themselves.
[04:58.680 --> 05:02.320]  What the entire cannabis community has done over years, they've got all of that data to
[05:02.320 --> 05:04.680]  themselves and they charged us to get it.
[05:04.680 --> 05:10.040]  They charge you $250 to $300 per submission to enter a strain into their galaxy.
[05:10.040 --> 05:11.540]  So they charged us money.
[05:11.540 --> 05:13.000]  They put our strains into their galaxy.
[05:13.520 --> 05:15.000]  Now they're using that data to their advantage.
[05:15.000 --> 05:19.080]  That is what is kind of pissing off a lot of growers and breeders in the industry.
[05:19.080 --> 05:21.600]  As a breeder, I'm not worried.
[05:21.600 --> 05:26.160]  If and when they do get to breeding and creating their own strains, they're going to hire breeders
[05:26.160 --> 05:29.320]  who are people just like us who have experience with plants.
[05:29.320 --> 05:32.280]  They're going to pay those people to do projects that are charted out.
[05:32.280 --> 05:33.760]  They're going to have instructions to follow.
[05:33.760 --> 05:35.880]  That's how breeding happens.
[05:35.880 --> 05:39.480]  They are going to be Budweiser or Walmart.
[05:39.480 --> 05:41.880]  I'm always going to be whoever.
[05:41.880 --> 05:43.280]  I don't even know the smaller one to compare it to.
[05:43.280 --> 05:44.920]  I'm always going to be mom and pop.
[05:44.920 --> 05:46.160]  People are always going to...
[05:46.160 --> 05:47.160]  There's going to be a choice.
[05:47.160 --> 05:48.160]  A lot of people go to Walmart.
[05:48.160 --> 05:52.040]  A lot of people buy Budweiser, but so many people want that mom and pop stuff.
[05:52.040 --> 05:53.040]  So I'm not worried about it.
[05:53.040 --> 05:55.160]  I think there's integrity in good breeding.
[05:55.160 --> 05:58.200]  I think what they're doing, in a way, it helps the movement.
[05:58.200 --> 05:59.200]  It helps the industry.
[05:59.200 --> 06:00.200]  It helps the plant.
[06:00.200 --> 06:01.200]  We're going to develop...
[06:01.200 --> 06:05.200]  They are going to develop plants that will be, they say, more resistant to bugs, more
[06:05.200 --> 06:09.600]  resistant to pathogens, more resistant to mildew and molds.
[06:09.600 --> 06:15.520]  And they claim that they'll be able to dial in specific strains to have very specific
[06:15.520 --> 06:20.920]  terpene profiles to where if you want cheesecake, you can breed a strain that tastes like cheesecake,
[06:20.920 --> 06:22.640]  or you can breed one that tastes like...
[06:22.640 --> 06:27.080]  How much of their database is a public knowledge that another breeder could use their data
[06:27.080 --> 06:29.880]  and do the same thing and choose the parents that they want?
[06:29.880 --> 06:32.080]  Because isn't it kind of like a public thing?
[06:32.080 --> 06:33.080]  It's not...
[06:33.080 --> 06:34.080]  Or do they have their own...
[06:34.080 --> 06:35.080]  They recommend that.
[06:35.960 --> 06:41.480]  If you explore their galaxy, there are spaces where they recommend breeding specific strains
[06:41.480 --> 06:42.480]  together.
[06:42.480 --> 06:43.920]  They say, nobody has done this yet.
[06:43.920 --> 06:48.120]  And since these strains are so far apart in our galaxy, we recommend breeding them because
[06:48.120 --> 06:49.960]  it would make unique phenotypes.
[06:49.960 --> 06:54.560]  It's something that they actually send that to you when you file strains with their galaxy.
[06:54.560 --> 06:56.480]  They'll make those recommendations for you.
[06:56.480 --> 06:58.880]  And they actually suggested something that I had already done.
[06:58.880 --> 06:59.880]  They recommended I-Crossed.
[06:59.880 --> 07:04.120]  First, they said Girl Scout Cookies to Grateful Dog, and I had already done it.
[07:04.160 --> 07:08.680]  They also suggested I-Crossed the Space Queen to my Grateful Dog, and I had already done
[07:08.680 --> 07:09.680]  that.
[07:09.680 --> 07:12.520]  So they were predicting things that I was going to do.
[07:12.520 --> 07:15.920]  They were predicting my moves that I had been planning through science.
[07:15.920 --> 07:17.520]  They saw it before I did.
[07:17.520 --> 07:18.520]  So there was an advantage to it.
[07:18.520 --> 07:21.480]  That's almost scary in a way, isn't it?
[07:21.480 --> 07:28.120]  As a breeder, a lot of the information they have is lineage information.
[07:28.120 --> 07:35.160]  Besides a lot of unknown cultivars where you don't know the lineage, most of the data
[07:35.160 --> 07:38.360]  was out there.
[07:38.360 --> 07:44.520]  As a breeder, before you take upon any project, you do your research and do what you're crossing.
[07:44.520 --> 07:48.480]  You don't just go, oh, this looks pretty, and this looks pretty, and slap them together.
[07:48.480 --> 07:49.480]  Hopefully.
[07:49.480 --> 07:51.480]  Yeah, hopefully.
[07:51.480 --> 07:52.920]  There's a long process behind it.
[07:52.920 --> 07:57.000]  And the information was out there and is out there.
[07:57.000 --> 07:58.240]  You find your lineages.
[07:58.240 --> 08:02.760]  You see how those have been grown out and what the results.
[08:02.760 --> 08:09.240]  And you make your best educated decision based off of the data that you draw.
[08:09.240 --> 08:14.400]  They've just drawn a ton of data and brought it into one spot.
[08:14.400 --> 08:16.280]  A ton of data.
[08:16.280 --> 08:17.840]  And here's the thing.
[08:17.840 --> 08:22.360]  Everybody forgets how many active compounds a cannabis plant itself has.
[08:22.960 --> 08:29.120]  Every seed is a little different than the other seed that you germinate.
[08:29.120 --> 08:32.960]  They may be similar, but there's still different compounds that are a little bit higher in
[08:32.960 --> 08:33.960]  each one.
[08:33.960 --> 08:38.640]  So for them to really take that and say, hey, this is what we're going to create, they still
[08:38.640 --> 08:42.180]  don't know exactly what all compounds they're going to find.
[08:42.180 --> 08:45.360]  They have an idea, but they don't know for sure.
[08:45.360 --> 08:47.600]  And that's what they're looking for through these markers.
[08:47.600 --> 08:54.160]  I like the fact that Jeff compared them to like Budweiser or like Miller or something.
[08:54.160 --> 08:58.000]  A really big, just broad industry.
[08:58.000 --> 09:04.320]  And me personally, I'm not a drinker, but I would much rather go to a small brewery.
[09:04.320 --> 09:11.000]  I would much rather support a small home brewer versus a big corporation like Miller.
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.080]  There's tons of people out there that want that stuff, that are perfectly happy and fine
[09:15.080 --> 09:16.080]  with that.
[09:16.160 --> 09:17.160]  Hey, what's going on, Humidor?
[09:17.160 --> 09:18.160]  Hey guys.
[09:18.160 --> 09:19.160]  Hey guys.
[09:19.160 --> 09:23.320]  The Embracing Organics podcast is recorded live on Google Hangouts, which gives the opportunity
[09:23.320 --> 09:27.440]  for guests to come and go at different points of the show.
[09:27.440 --> 09:28.920]  Sometimes I have to leave the show early.
[09:28.920 --> 09:30.320]  Sometimes I show up for the show late.
[09:30.320 --> 09:33.120]  At this point in the show, we were joined by another friend.
[09:33.120 --> 09:34.280]  We politely greeted him.
[09:34.280 --> 09:36.320]  We said hello to him for a few minutes.
[09:36.320 --> 09:37.880]  We let him talk about where he was.
[09:37.880 --> 09:39.200]  He was at a new cannabis club.
[09:39.200 --> 09:41.040]  We let him hype that up for a few minutes.
[09:41.040 --> 09:42.800]  He politely said goodbye.
[09:42.800 --> 09:45.880]  Then we continued on with our talk about phyllos.
[09:45.880 --> 09:49.080]  Dirtman Dan seemed to remember exactly where he was.
[09:49.080 --> 09:51.280]  Let's just let him pick up right where he left off.
[09:51.280 --> 09:53.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, here is Dirtman Dan.
[09:53.680 --> 09:59.200]  Yeah, like I was saying earlier, I like the fact that Jeff was comparing these guys to
[09:59.200 --> 10:03.040]  a big corporation like a Walmart or a Miller or something like that.
[10:03.040 --> 10:10.800]  Yes, there is their place for it, but me being the person I am, I like supporting the small
[10:10.800 --> 10:15.400]  mom and pop shops, even though there is that giant corporation right down the street.
[10:15.440 --> 10:18.920]  I'm going to wind up spending more at the mom and pop shop.
[10:19.600 --> 10:22.840]  But I know at the end of the day, I'm probably getting a better quality product.
[10:22.840 --> 10:24.280]  And that makes me happier.
[10:24.880 --> 10:31.120]  Well, I think some of the issues, too, were is people weren't getting credit for some
[10:31.120 --> 10:33.520]  of these genetics that people sold over the years.
[10:34.320 --> 10:40.800]  And people wanted to know what really was going on and who really had what to begin
[10:40.800 --> 10:43.840]  with. And this kind of helps sort through some of that.
[10:46.040 --> 10:48.480]  Oh, yeah. Now we can see we can trace it back through DNA.
[10:48.520 --> 10:52.560]  We can see, well, that came from this, came from this, came from this or now we have more
[10:52.560 --> 10:54.760]  opportunity to find out what really is.
[10:55.280 --> 10:57.960]  We're going to find out what really is, where it came from.
[10:58.200 --> 11:04.600]  We'll find out if all these different different named OG's, the SFV, the original OG, all
[11:04.600 --> 11:07.760]  the different ones, we'll find out if they're the same cut or if they came from the same
[11:07.760 --> 11:11.360]  seed stock. We'll be able to narrow that down and end that rumor, which will be really
[11:11.360 --> 11:12.920]  cool for the cannabis world.
[11:13.120 --> 11:18.280]  Yeah, because everybody swears they have a cut of the OG or, you know, I got OG this, I
[11:18.280 --> 11:21.440]  got OG that. Dude, it don't matter where you're at.
[11:21.440 --> 11:22.880]  Somebody's got the OG.
[11:23.360 --> 11:26.040]  Yeah. But is it that original OG?
[11:26.040 --> 11:29.400]  Because there are so many OG's back in the day and there's the SFV and then there's the
[11:29.400 --> 11:31.480]  Tahoe and they're probably very similar.
[11:31.480 --> 11:33.440]  Very. Yeah, exactly.
[11:33.920 --> 11:39.880]  There's so many ones from supposedly the one group, like so many different variances and
[11:39.960 --> 11:42.480]  Fino expressions that came out of that.
[11:43.840 --> 11:49.400]  So it'd be really interesting to see plants being handed down and down from generation
[11:49.400 --> 11:51.480]  generation just also gets lost to.
[11:51.760 --> 11:56.640]  Yeah, somebody will somebody, you know, forget what it is and then make up a name.
[11:56.640 --> 11:58.920]  And we've been growing that for forever.
[11:58.920 --> 12:00.280]  It doesn't matter what the name is.
[12:00.360 --> 12:02.160]  Even labeling.
[12:02.880 --> 12:05.120]  I mean, fucking mislabeled some shit.
[12:05.280 --> 12:06.440]  I don't think people forgot.
[12:06.440 --> 12:10.560]  I think that in your neighborhood, there's a guy over there selling OG Kush and
[12:10.560 --> 12:11.760]  everyone's buying OG Kush.
[12:11.760 --> 12:13.000]  But I need mine to be different.
[12:13.160 --> 12:14.840]  So I'm going to call it Jeff's OG.
[12:14.880 --> 12:18.200]  And now mine's a little bit more expensive and you want to buy Jeff's OG because it's
[12:18.200 --> 12:19.960]  that new hot shit. So we just got to rename it.
[12:20.240 --> 12:21.520]  And that's how a lot of that happens.
[12:21.800 --> 12:22.920]  Hey, exactly.
[12:22.920 --> 12:27.520]  Because I know many times I was handed cuts and I was told that these are kind of
[12:27.520 --> 12:30.120]  exclusive and don't really say what they are.
[12:30.120 --> 12:34.040]  If you're going to show them on your channel, change the name of them, something like
[12:34.520 --> 12:37.600]  we don't want people to know what this is and where it came from.
[12:37.600 --> 12:39.080]  Like, oh, OK.
[12:39.400 --> 12:43.600]  Like I was saying before the show, I see a lot of this stuff as the inevitable.
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.240]  And like I am hoping for federal legalization, honestly.
[12:48.240 --> 12:51.320]  I mean, I want to be able to grow these plants like they're tomatoes.
[12:51.720 --> 12:57.240]  You know, I want everyone to be able to have access to it that needs or wants access
[12:57.240 --> 13:02.720]  to it as long as they're an adult and responsible with their lives, whatever.
[13:03.720 --> 13:12.720]  But my whole point is like this is only the inevitable of when legalization comes in,
[13:12.720 --> 13:17.760]  because you're going to have companies like Bayer, you know, big like Phylos is tiny.
[13:18.080 --> 13:22.440]  You're going to have big fucking boys coming in and throwing down, you know,
[13:22.480 --> 13:27.880]  intellectual property rights all over shit, trying to, you know, patent these strains
[13:27.880 --> 13:31.120]  and stuff. And they're going to have some real money to throw at it.
[13:31.480 --> 13:34.480]  And then people are really going to be shit pants like this.
[13:34.840 --> 13:41.160]  People are freaking out over nothing right now, over some some data, because that's all
[13:41.160 --> 13:43.040]  Phylos has is data.
[13:43.920 --> 13:48.000]  Yeah, but I think it's going to be too hard to patent this plant itself.
[13:48.280 --> 13:49.880]  There's too many variables to it.
[13:50.440 --> 13:54.440]  Hey, you got a plant going to do besides hurt.
[13:54.440 --> 13:55.720]  Maybe you're trying to be illegal.
[13:56.280 --> 14:00.240]  They're going to put some sort of tracer in there and they're going to let their shit
[14:00.240 --> 14:03.280]  grow and their pollens going to fucking fly or something.
[14:03.600 --> 14:08.920]  And then they're going to come in your field, find, you know, seed in your fucking crop
[14:09.560 --> 14:12.080]  from what their genetic traits are in it.
[14:12.080 --> 14:14.440]  Monsanto right there.
[14:14.440 --> 14:17.040]  Yeah. See, you know, that's what Monsanto already does.
[14:17.040 --> 14:21.240]  But the farmers lost their farms because of all this shit.
[14:21.240 --> 14:23.200]  Yeah, that's some horrible shit that happened.
[14:23.480 --> 14:26.720]  So at this point in the show, we kind of drifted off into a different conversation.
[14:26.840 --> 14:30.080]  There are about six people in the live feed at this point, so it does get a little bit
[14:30.080 --> 14:32.200]  hectic. I chose to cut out at this point.
[14:32.360 --> 14:37.560]  You can hear the full unedited version of that podcast on the Embracing Organics
[14:37.560 --> 14:42.640]  YouTube channel. That original episode aired on May the second, which was a Thursday.
[14:42.760 --> 14:45.360]  So that should be really easy to find on the YouTube channel.
[14:45.680 --> 14:48.000]  I do encourage you to go listen to that full episode.
[14:48.000 --> 14:52.760]  I also encourage you to subscribe to the Embracing Organics podcast YouTube channel.
[14:53.000 --> 14:57.080]  Then next week you can join us for the next Live Thursday podcast.
[14:57.280 --> 15:01.360]  All right. There is more to talk about here with the Phyllos Galaxy controversy.
[15:01.560 --> 15:06.880]  As Stabby and Medfit touched on, there are things to think about like intellectual
[15:06.880 --> 15:12.440]  property. A lot of breeders, a lot of creators of very popular strains sent their
[15:12.440 --> 15:14.280]  information to Phyllos.
[15:14.280 --> 15:15.640]  They have now got our data.
[15:15.640 --> 15:17.640]  They have got our intellectual property.
[15:17.640 --> 15:22.440]  They are going to use our intellectual property to further their breeding projects.
[15:22.840 --> 15:24.880]  There are a lot of different ways to think about this.
[15:24.880 --> 15:26.960]  You can think about this as your art being used.
[15:26.960 --> 15:29.000]  You can think about it as your business being used.
[15:29.160 --> 15:31.840]  There are a lot of different approaches to come at this subject.
[15:31.840 --> 15:35.800]  I'm trying to come at it from all angles and keep a clear head and an open mind so
[15:35.800 --> 15:39.320]  that I can relay the information properly without being biased.
[15:40.040 --> 15:44.280]  A recent rumor or allegation that has been flying through the cannabis community and
[15:44.280 --> 15:49.760]  social media is that Phyllos Bioscience may possibly be linked up with a company in
[15:49.760 --> 15:55.400]  Israel who is actively working to patent specific cannabis strains or variety.
[15:55.560 --> 15:59.640]  So that is something that would be really shitty and shady of them to do.
[15:59.640 --> 16:01.800]  We gave them our plant data.
[16:01.880 --> 16:04.960]  Now they are using that data to create their own patents.
[16:05.480 --> 16:09.400]  That is, again, an allegation and a rumor that I will look more into and I will
[16:09.400 --> 16:12.920]  report more information to you as it does come to light.
[16:12.920 --> 16:15.280]  There is a lot of information coming out very quickly.
[16:15.640 --> 16:20.160]  The owner and spokesperson of Phyllos Bioscience has been scheduled to appear and
[16:20.160 --> 16:25.360]  speak on numerous podcasts this past week, but as expected, he has backed out at the
[16:25.360 --> 16:28.360]  last moment for every interview he has scheduled.
[16:28.640 --> 16:32.640]  So when I do find more information, I will update you with that information and I will
[16:32.640 --> 16:36.800]  keep you guys in the loop as to what is happening with Phyllos Bioscience.
[16:37.520 --> 16:40.560]  As I'm wrapping up this recording, I just received a message from our friend
[16:40.560 --> 16:44.080]  Medically Fit, who's joining us on the Embracing Organics podcast.
[16:44.360 --> 16:48.960]  He has sent me a video that has a lot of detailed information from the spokesperson
[16:48.960 --> 16:51.400]  and owner of Phyllos Bioscience.
[16:51.760 --> 16:55.080]  This video can be found on the Soil King's YouTube channel.
[16:55.120 --> 16:58.280]  So go to YouTube, search for The Soil King.
[16:58.480 --> 17:00.480]  He's got 18,000 subscribers.
[17:01.040 --> 17:02.080]  Give him a subscribe.
[17:02.120 --> 17:06.840]  And the video you are looking for is Phyllos Bioscience Industry Leaders with
[17:06.840 --> 17:08.960]  Mowgli. That's the video you want to watch.
[17:09.120 --> 17:14.240]  Mowgli speaks for almost an hour about the things he said in that controversial
[17:14.360 --> 17:18.640]  YouTube video, that controversial Instagram clip that everybody saw that sparked all
[17:18.640 --> 17:20.920]  of this controversy for his company.
[17:21.120 --> 17:26.560]  So I recommend you check out Phyllos Bioscience Industry Leaders with Mowgli
[17:26.840 --> 17:29.240]  on The Soil King's YouTube channel.
[17:29.280 --> 17:32.760]  And of course, give him a subscribe since he's got such a great video up.
[17:33.280 --> 17:36.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, I think that is all I have got to cover for the Phyllos
[17:36.680 --> 17:38.200]  Bioscience controversy.
[17:38.200 --> 17:42.080]  If I do learn more, I will do my best to present that to you on this podcast.
[17:42.120 --> 17:47.120]  I think the conversation between Mowgli and our friend Soil King will answer most
[17:47.120 --> 17:48.560]  of the remaining questions.
[17:48.880 --> 17:51.720]  Once again, I want to give a huge shout out to all of my friends over there at the
[17:51.720 --> 17:53.320]  Embracing Organics podcast.

[18:03.280 --> 18:04.400]  I'm sure there's somebody I missed.
[18:04.400 --> 18:06.720]  A lot of people cycle in and out of that chat room.
[18:06.880 --> 18:08.440]  Of course, a big shout out to Pedro.
[18:08.560 --> 18:09.960]  And of course, a big shout out to Dizzy.
