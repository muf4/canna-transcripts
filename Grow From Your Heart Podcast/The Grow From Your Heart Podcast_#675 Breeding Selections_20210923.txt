[00:04.600 --> 00:13.960]  Yeah, welcome back podcast world.
[00:13.960 --> 00:21.040]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 675 of the Grow From Your
[00:21.040 --> 00:22.660]  Heart podcast.
[00:22.660 --> 00:25.840]  In this episode, I'm going to read a couple of Patreon questions.
[00:25.840 --> 00:29.420]  Before we get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great
[00:29.420 --> 00:32.800]  folks who support the show on Patreon.
[00:32.800 --> 00:36.320]  Let's start off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to my friend
[00:36.320 --> 00:37.880]  Girls Grow Too.
[00:37.880 --> 00:40.900]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Kano Organic Illinois.
[00:40.900 --> 00:44.020]  Let's send a big thank you shout out and a fist bump to Magic Mike.

[00:56.100 --> 01:00.160]  Let's send a Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to another longtime supporter,
[01:00.160 --> 01:01.360]  Gramps Memel.
[01:01.360 --> 01:03.240]  Let's send a thank you shout out to my buddy Eric Ross.
[01:03.720 --> 01:07.560]  I want to send a big fist bump and a thank you shout out to Single T. Let's send a thank
[01:07.560 --> 01:09.940]  you shout out to Brohan76.
[01:09.940 --> 01:13.800]  Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out
[01:13.800 --> 01:19.140]  to my buddy Matthew T. Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support
[01:19.140 --> 01:20.740]  the show on Patreon.
[01:20.740 --> 01:24.480]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:24.480 --> 01:30.880]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.

[01:34.360 --> 01:40.320]  a link in the show notes and in the video description to make it nice and easy for all
[01:40.320 --> 01:42.800]  of my friends.
[01:42.800 --> 01:46.240]  This is of course the part of the show where I do invite you to join us on the Discord
[01:46.240 --> 01:47.240]  server.
[01:47.240 --> 01:51.200]  The Discord server is approaching 1500 members.
[01:51.200 --> 01:55.520]  By the time this podcast episode comes out, we might have 1500 members on the Discord
[01:55.520 --> 01:56.760]  server.
[01:56.760 --> 02:00.600]  Big salute, shout out, thank you for all of the support on Discord.
[02:00.600 --> 02:01.600]  It's a good time over there.
[02:01.600 --> 02:03.400]  I'm having a great time hanging out with people.
[02:03.400 --> 02:04.880]  I try to jump in the chat.
[02:04.880 --> 02:10.280]  I just posted some questions and actually a secret strain release idea asking for strain
[02:10.280 --> 02:11.280]  names.
[02:11.280 --> 02:14.600]  A bunch of stuff happens over there on the Discord so please do join us on the Discord.
[02:14.600 --> 02:19.680]  There is a link of course in the show notes and in the video description.
[02:19.680 --> 02:24.800]  It has been a long time since I've talked about what strain I'm smoking on the podcast.
[02:24.800 --> 02:29.640]  I need to mention what strain I'm smoking because it feels like I've got bricks on my
[02:29.680 --> 02:34.480]  head or maybe I've got some kind of belt around my brain.
[02:34.480 --> 02:35.720]  I feel slow motion.
[02:35.720 --> 02:41.680]  I took a big fat dab of some blue fruit live rosin from Green Dot Labs.
[02:41.680 --> 02:43.080]  Nobody pays me to talk about it.
[02:43.080 --> 02:44.080]  Nobody gives me the concentrates.
[02:44.080 --> 02:46.680]  I went to the local dispensary and I bought it.
[02:46.680 --> 02:51.800]  I brought it home, set up the equipment, thought I should take a dab before I record and that
[02:51.800 --> 02:54.240]  stuff put me in slow motion.
[02:54.240 --> 02:58.960]  So if you catch me going a little bit slow looking, feeling a little bit confused, you're
[02:59.280 --> 03:00.280]  right.
[03:00.280 --> 03:01.800]  It's from the blue fruit and I am enjoying it.
[03:01.800 --> 03:03.600]  So big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[03:03.600 --> 03:04.840]  Honestly, they do not pay me.
[03:04.840 --> 03:05.960]  They don't sponsor the show.
[03:05.960 --> 03:09.480]  I just enjoyed the dab that I just took so much that I thought you might notice and I
[03:09.480 --> 03:10.840]  should mention how good it was.
[03:10.840 --> 03:12.120]  All right, let's keep things moving.
[03:12.120 --> 03:15.640]  The next order of business I want to talk about is I want to send a big thank you shout
[03:15.640 --> 03:21.640]  out to all of the people that I ran into at the Colorado Cool Vibes Reggae Festival at
[03:21.640 --> 03:24.440]  the Levitt Pavilion in Denver, Colorado.
[03:24.440 --> 03:25.440]  There was a reggae festival.
[03:25.440 --> 03:27.800]  It was the first year of the reggae festival.
[03:27.800 --> 03:31.800]  With the outcome that I saw, I guarantee we will have that festival again.
[03:31.800 --> 03:34.560]  I hope a lot of the same bands return.
[03:34.560 --> 03:35.560]  It was.
[03:35.560 --> 03:36.920]  Let me talk about some of the bands that we got to see.
[03:36.920 --> 03:39.800]  We got to see when I showed up, Mighty Mystic was playing.
[03:39.800 --> 03:43.300]  If you're a reggae fan, you probably know Mighty Mystic.
[03:43.300 --> 03:46.800]  After the Mighty Mystic, I think we got to see Jamiri Morgan.
[03:46.800 --> 03:48.880]  Big up to my buddy Jamiri Morgan.
[03:48.880 --> 03:53.920]  Jamiri is the son of Gramps Morgan, who of course is a member of Morgan Heritage, who
[03:54.080 --> 03:59.000]  is one of probably my top three, top five reggae bands of all time.
[03:59.000 --> 04:04.080]  I might maybe have gotten to hang out with Jamiri Morgan and Morgan Heritage a little
[04:04.080 --> 04:05.080]  bit.
[04:05.080 --> 04:06.080]  Not going to talk too much about that.
[04:06.080 --> 04:09.920]  You can tell by the smile on my face how much fun I had there.
[04:09.920 --> 04:12.420]  We got to see Mighty Mystic, Jamiri Morgan.
[04:12.420 --> 04:15.760]  After Jamiri Morgan, a band called Through the Roots came on stage.
[04:15.760 --> 04:18.720]  They're the band that sings Sorry For My Bloodshot Eyes.
[04:18.720 --> 04:22.600]  If you listen to reggae, if you listen to reggae radio, any reggae channel, you've heard
[04:22.600 --> 04:23.600]  that song.
[04:23.780 --> 04:25.600]  Got to see those guys.
[04:25.600 --> 04:29.440]  Then we got to see the beautiful, lovely, and amazing Natalie Rise.
[04:29.440 --> 04:31.000]  That was pretty awesome.
[04:31.000 --> 04:33.120]  I talked about going to a reggae show a few nights ago.
[04:33.120 --> 04:35.240]  I went to another reggae show since then.
[04:35.240 --> 04:36.880]  I haven't missed a show on the tour yet.
[04:36.880 --> 04:38.160]  It was just kind of a joke.
[04:38.160 --> 04:40.840]  There's only been two shows on the tour so far, you guys.
[04:40.840 --> 04:42.800]  But I haven't missed a show on the tour.
[04:42.800 --> 04:46.000]  But it's been a good time hanging out with all the reggae artists on Saturday at the
[04:46.000 --> 04:47.000]  reggae festival.
[04:47.000 --> 04:49.600]  I kind of got to hang out with everybody and got spoiled.
[04:49.600 --> 04:53.520]  So a lot of the cannabis community was present at that festival.
[04:53.520 --> 04:57.280]  A lot of the reggae community was present at that festival.
[04:57.280 --> 04:58.280]  It was a good time.
[04:58.280 --> 05:02.720]  A lot of people came and gave me hugs, high fives, fist bumps, love and respect.
[05:02.720 --> 05:07.300]  Big shout out to everybody who gave me any sort of love, respect, high five, fist bump.
[05:07.300 --> 05:10.700]  If you took a minute to compliment my dreadlocks or my shoes, thank you.
[05:10.700 --> 05:12.080]  It was a great day.
[05:12.080 --> 05:17.180]  I was just beaming with good vibes and big energy because a reggae show is like my favorite
[05:17.180 --> 05:18.240]  place to be.
[05:18.280 --> 05:21.520]  I was specially invited by one of my favorite performers.
[05:21.520 --> 05:26.520]  I got to hang out with some of my favorite reggae artists and see some of my favorite
[05:26.520 --> 05:27.520]  people.
[05:27.520 --> 05:30.080]  Some of the older Rastas that I look up to were there.
[05:30.080 --> 05:34.400]  The Colorado locals that have been putting on reggae shows for years and have been in
[05:34.400 --> 05:37.840]  reggae bands here for years, I got to hang out with them, hang out with some popular
[05:37.840 --> 05:38.840]  reggae bands.
[05:38.840 --> 05:39.840]  That was a good time.
[05:39.840 --> 05:40.880]  You could tell, still vibing from it.
[05:40.880 --> 05:44.020]  So big up to everybody who showed me some love at the reggae festival.
[05:44.020 --> 05:45.840]  You guys are not here to talk about a reggae fest.
[05:45.840 --> 05:48.960]  You guys are here to talk about growing ganja.
[05:48.960 --> 05:50.440]  So let's focus a little bit on that.
[05:50.440 --> 05:52.360]  Thanks for letting me rant about reggae music for a minute.
[05:52.360 --> 05:53.360]  I caught myself chattering.
[05:53.360 --> 05:54.360]  I'm high.
[05:54.360 --> 05:56.120]  We'll get back on track here.
[05:56.120 --> 05:57.920]  I do have some great Patreon questions.
[05:57.920 --> 05:59.420]  That's what we're going to talk about.
[05:59.420 --> 06:00.420]  That's what we are going to talk about.
[06:00.420 --> 06:02.200]  I'm not even going to edit that one.
[06:02.200 --> 06:04.080]  We are going to talk about some Patreon questions.
[06:04.080 --> 06:06.720]  Once again, patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[06:06.720 --> 06:08.720]  We will jump right into it.
[06:08.720 --> 06:10.860]  We're going to go with this one first.
[06:10.860 --> 06:13.000]  This one came from my friend.
[06:13.000 --> 06:16.040]  It looks like what name do they want me to use?
[06:16.040 --> 06:20.160]  We're going to say this came from our friend Warwick and it goes a lot like this.
[06:20.160 --> 06:21.560]  It says, what's up Rasta Jeff.
[06:21.560 --> 06:27.400]  I have some seeds from a source who has some sort of wizard of Oz on and they call it killer
[06:27.400 --> 06:28.400]  green bud.
[06:28.400 --> 06:32.240]  And I was looking at crossing that with some of your genetics.
[06:32.240 --> 06:33.680]  Which would you suggest?
[06:33.680 --> 06:35.200]  Cheers from Warwick.
[06:35.200 --> 06:37.080]  PS, I love the podcast.
[06:37.080 --> 06:38.620]  Warwick, big shout out.
[06:38.620 --> 06:41.020]  Great compliment for loving the podcast.
[06:41.020 --> 06:44.100]  Even better compliment, wanting to breed with my genetics.
[06:44.100 --> 06:46.060]  That is a very good question.
[06:46.060 --> 06:49.380]  So you've got some seeds that I don't know what those seeds are.
[06:49.380 --> 06:50.380]  The wizard of Oz.
[06:50.380 --> 06:51.380]  I don't know what that is.
[06:51.380 --> 06:52.380]  I don't know where they came from.
[06:52.380 --> 06:55.580]  I could have done some research, but honestly that wouldn't help me out too much with my
[06:55.580 --> 06:56.580]  advice.
[06:56.580 --> 06:59.360]  I would give you the same exact advice probably.
[06:59.360 --> 07:00.520]  You've got seeds.
[07:00.520 --> 07:06.180]  So do you want to use a male from my plants or a male from that pack of seeds?
[07:06.180 --> 07:09.420]  Like have you decided which side is going to be which?
[07:10.140 --> 07:12.460]  Who you're going to use the male from, who you're going to use the female from.
[07:12.460 --> 07:19.940]  Have you done any commitment or deciding or any dedication to which side is which?
[07:19.940 --> 07:20.940]  Have you thought about that?
[07:20.940 --> 07:22.660]  So you've got some seeds.
[07:22.660 --> 07:23.660]  Who has some wizard of Oz?
[07:23.660 --> 07:25.540]  You're going to have to grow the wizard of Oz.
[07:25.540 --> 07:29.700]  Then you're going to have to grow some of my seeds and we'll talk about which ones later
[07:29.700 --> 07:31.080]  on.
[07:31.080 --> 07:32.080]  Grow that wizard of Oz.
[07:32.080 --> 07:33.080]  Do you find a good boy?
[07:33.080 --> 07:34.080]  Do you find a good female?
[07:34.080 --> 07:35.960]  Is there something you like in there?
[07:35.960 --> 07:39.020]  What stands out about that plant that makes you want to breed with it?
[07:39.620 --> 07:40.620]  That's what I want to know.
[07:40.620 --> 07:41.620]  What is your goal?
[07:41.620 --> 07:44.700]  It all boils down to where I'm headed with this is what is your goal?
[07:44.700 --> 07:48.260]  When you're breeding cannabis plants, one of your main objectives, one of your main
[07:48.260 --> 07:50.620]  things to think about is what is the goal?
[07:50.620 --> 07:51.620]  What's your purpose here?
[07:51.620 --> 07:53.540]  Why are you breeding these plants?
[07:53.540 --> 07:58.580]  I appreciate that you want to breed with my stuff because you like something about my
[07:58.580 --> 08:00.260]  brand makes you want to breed with it.
[08:00.260 --> 08:01.860]  I appreciate that.
[08:01.860 --> 08:05.260]  But what makes you want to breed with these particular plants?
[08:05.260 --> 08:08.300]  There's got to be a goal in mind when you're breeding.
[08:08.300 --> 08:09.780]  Could be I want to make some hot fire.
[08:09.780 --> 08:10.780]  Cool.
[08:10.780 --> 08:11.780]  That's a great idea.
[08:11.780 --> 08:15.020]  But what traits make hot fire in your opinion?
[08:15.020 --> 08:16.060]  What is a good pie?
[08:16.060 --> 08:17.380]  What's a good cake in your opinion?
[08:17.380 --> 08:18.900]  Because you are being a chef now.
[08:18.900 --> 08:20.580]  You're the one mixing shit up.
[08:20.580 --> 08:21.580]  What is your goal?
[08:21.580 --> 08:22.580]  What are you trying to bake?
[08:22.580 --> 08:26.060]  If you're trying to make pizza, then we don't need to order.
[08:26.060 --> 08:29.300]  If we if you're making pizza, we need to order cheese and pizza sauce.
[08:29.300 --> 08:31.900]  If you're making cakes, we need to order totally different.
[08:31.900 --> 08:34.260]  We don't need any cheese and pizza sauce in our cake.
[08:34.260 --> 08:35.540]  So it's all about your goal.
[08:35.540 --> 08:36.860]  What do you want?
[08:36.860 --> 08:40.460]  So I would say grow start off grow some of these.
[08:40.460 --> 08:41.460]  What are they called?
[08:41.460 --> 08:44.460]  Wizard of Oz kill a green bud seeds and see what you get.
[08:44.460 --> 08:45.740]  Do you find a stellar male?
[08:45.740 --> 08:47.500]  Do you find a stellar female?
[08:47.500 --> 08:52.940]  Is there a plant in there that talks to you that just says I am a standout breeding plant?
[08:52.940 --> 08:56.540]  I see that as a breeder as a passionate cannabis grower.
[08:56.540 --> 09:00.780]  Somebody that's been around these plants and seen them express themselves so many different
[09:00.780 --> 09:01.780]  ways.
[09:01.780 --> 09:05.540]  I see plants and I go that right there is something you should breed with and that intuition
[09:05.540 --> 09:06.540]  will kick in.
[09:07.220 --> 09:11.380]  So learn about Mendel charts, learn about aliel charts, learn all of that stuff, then
[09:11.380 --> 09:13.980]  build some intuition on which plants to breed with.
[09:13.980 --> 09:15.660]  Then grow these seeds.
[09:15.660 --> 09:18.000]  Find a male or female that gets your attention.
[09:18.000 --> 09:19.320]  Keep them have a clone of that.
[09:19.320 --> 09:22.940]  Keep a mother plant of that grow it several times build a relationship with that plant
[09:22.940 --> 09:27.420]  so you understand how it reacts in response to different feedings, different conditions,
[09:27.420 --> 09:30.340]  different stresses, learn it very well.
[09:30.340 --> 09:33.520]  Then think about what your goal is.
[09:33.520 --> 09:37.120]  What does that plant have that it would mix well with?
[09:37.120 --> 09:40.200]  What is that plant missing that you want to maybe correct?
[09:40.200 --> 09:42.760]  What could you improve upon with that plant?
[09:42.760 --> 09:46.560]  What turps are going to mix well with that plant?
[09:46.560 --> 09:49.720]  What structure will combine well with that plant?
[09:49.720 --> 09:50.720]  Think about things like that.
[09:50.720 --> 09:53.480]  Now what is your goal is something I keep saying.
[09:53.480 --> 09:57.920]  I don't know what the flavors, the aromas, the structure, the potency.
[09:57.920 --> 10:00.660]  I don't know anything about the plant that you're starting with.
[10:00.660 --> 10:04.220]  That's why you've got to grow it, test it, find the keeper that you like.
[10:04.220 --> 10:05.380]  Then we'll breed with that.
[10:05.380 --> 10:07.140]  Then what is your goal?
[10:07.140 --> 10:13.020]  Do you want to make something really tall and skinny that takes 77 to 85 days to flower
[10:13.020 --> 10:14.020]  or do you want the opposite?
[10:14.020 --> 10:18.600]  Do you want something short and squatty that finishes in 55 to 63 days?
[10:18.600 --> 10:22.540]  Do you want something that will rip your brain apart the first time you smoke it?
[10:22.540 --> 10:25.860]  You take two rips off of it and it feels like your head just exploded and beams of light
[10:25.860 --> 10:26.860]  came out of it.
[10:26.860 --> 10:28.820]  You're fucking panicking and paranoid.
[10:29.260 --> 10:33.580]  Do you want to take two fat rips and just melt into the couch and be part of the couch?
[10:33.580 --> 10:34.580]  It's all about your goal.
[10:34.580 --> 10:38.660]  It's really hard for me to tell you what to breed with because I don't know your goal.
[10:38.660 --> 10:40.020]  I don't know if you're trying to make pizzas.
[10:40.020 --> 10:41.980]  I don't know if you're trying to make apple pie.
[10:41.980 --> 10:46.060]  I'm not sure what ingredients to send for you from the store.
[10:46.060 --> 10:49.660]  Do you want something I can really guide you through is turps.
[10:49.660 --> 10:51.100]  Do you want strawberry turps?
[10:51.100 --> 10:52.220]  Do you want orange turps?
[10:52.220 --> 10:55.260]  Do you want funky blueberry skittley turps?
[10:55.260 --> 10:56.380]  What other turps should I write down?
[10:56.420 --> 10:59.220]  Do you just want pure gas and funky stank?
[10:59.220 --> 11:01.700]  I can steer you in directions with that.
[11:01.700 --> 11:06.020]  Of course, I've got strains that are kind of obviously labeled for that kind of project.
[11:06.020 --> 11:09.300]  If you want strawberries, strawberry starburst would be the way to go.
[11:09.300 --> 11:12.620]  If you want orangey orange turps, sunkiss would be the way to go.
[11:12.620 --> 11:15.500]  If you can get it, orangegasm would be the way to go.
[11:15.500 --> 11:19.940]  Now, if you get orangegasm, you're locked into either using the orangegasm as the female
[11:19.940 --> 11:24.460]  side of the cross because it's a feminized seed or you've got to find a good orangegasm,
[11:24.500 --> 11:26.420]  reverse it, use that as your pollen donor.
[11:26.420 --> 11:30.420]  So that puts you on a track for your breeding that does kind of make some decisions there
[11:30.420 --> 11:33.620]  for you when you use a feminized cross on one side.
[11:33.620 --> 11:35.420]  Side rant, it is totally fine.
[11:35.420 --> 11:36.420]  It's okay.
[11:36.420 --> 11:37.460]  I do it all the time.
[11:37.460 --> 11:40.380]  You can breed to a feminized seed.
[11:40.380 --> 11:42.620]  If you've got a seed, it was feminized.
[11:42.620 --> 11:44.060]  It works just like any other plant.
[11:44.060 --> 11:45.300]  You could breed to it.
[11:45.300 --> 11:47.300]  You can mother plant that bad bitch.
[11:47.300 --> 11:48.660]  It works just like the other plants.
[11:48.660 --> 11:51.940]  People have some weird rumors, myths, misconceptions.
[11:51.940 --> 11:52.940]  It's whack.
[11:52.940 --> 11:53.940]  It's not real.
[11:54.420 --> 11:55.420]  It's not like the other plants.
[11:55.420 --> 11:56.980]  The only difference was it was female for sure.
[11:56.980 --> 11:57.980]  All right.
[11:57.980 --> 12:01.300]  So if you're looking for certain flavors, certain turps, I can help you with that.
[12:01.300 --> 12:04.300]  Like I said, there's orange, there's strawberry, there's blueberry funkiness.
[12:04.300 --> 12:05.820]  I've got garlic stuff.
[12:05.820 --> 12:10.180]  I've got like a skunky, gassy, dirty feet kind of shit that I can recommend you breed
[12:10.180 --> 12:11.180]  with.
[12:11.180 --> 12:12.180]  That would be the double dose.
[12:12.180 --> 12:15.220]  If you want the garlicky stuff, use the dark hollow.
[12:15.220 --> 12:19.600]  A lot of my stuff is very, the names kind of give you a good hint of what the flavors
[12:19.600 --> 12:20.600]  are going to be like.
[12:20.600 --> 12:22.220]  Strawberry, there's blueberry butcher.
[12:22.420 --> 12:23.940]  It's going to taste like blueberry.
[12:23.940 --> 12:26.100]  So there are lemon Jeffries going to taste like lemons.
[12:26.100 --> 12:27.100]  There's stuff like that.
[12:27.100 --> 12:28.220]  Lemon sunrise tastes like lemons.
[12:28.220 --> 12:31.700]  I give you pretty strong hints with my turp profiles.
[12:31.700 --> 12:35.820]  So are you looking for a super high THC?
[12:35.820 --> 12:40.340]  Because a lot of my stuff will give you super high THC, but I would probably recommend using
[12:40.340 --> 12:45.920]  like an Arise or a Sonic Boom male to get that really high THC or anything with the
[12:45.920 --> 12:49.260]  Jack the Ripper crosses would contribute to super high THC.
[12:49.260 --> 12:52.380]  But along with that will come a longer flowering time.
[12:52.380 --> 12:55.780]  So those are things you have to negotiate with when it comes to breeding.
[12:55.780 --> 13:00.040]  And then you will find outliers in the phenotypes and then find an outlier.
[13:00.040 --> 13:04.980]  Find one that came from sativa dominant heavy genetics that were bred together.
[13:04.980 --> 13:09.020]  Find one that flowers in a short time and breed to that one again and breed to that
[13:09.020 --> 13:10.420]  one and keep finding short flowers.
[13:10.420 --> 13:14.940]  And you get that sativa dominant short flowering thing, which is kind of what I think they
[13:14.940 --> 13:16.260]  did with golden goat.
[13:16.260 --> 13:18.140]  Anyway, I'm on a ramble there.
[13:18.140 --> 13:22.260]  Are you looking for more of a sativa or indica outcome in your cross?
[13:22.260 --> 13:27.620]  If you want more sativa stuff, I would say go with like the Jack the Ripper crosses or
[13:27.620 --> 13:29.140]  straight up Arise.
[13:29.140 --> 13:33.700]  If you want more indica stuff, I would say use a morning dew, a dark hollow, or maybe
[13:33.700 --> 13:39.180]  a double dose as a female or maybe even a male in one of your crosses.
[13:39.180 --> 13:40.920]  It's really all about your goal.
[13:40.920 --> 13:45.060]  I said earlier, do you want a longer or shorter flowering project?
[13:45.060 --> 13:50.260]  Do you want them to finish in 55, 63 or do you want those 80 day flower plants?
[13:50.260 --> 13:53.820]  If you want to go longer, I would say use something, the Jack the Ripper stuff.
[13:53.820 --> 13:57.460]  I've said that before that Jack the Ripper stuff goes for a while.
[13:57.460 --> 14:01.240]  The morning dew, the prana, the sun kiss, those finish a little bit earlier.
[14:01.240 --> 14:04.500]  If you want some quicker finishing stuff, that's what I would recommend.
[14:04.500 --> 14:11.060]  But overall, it's hard for me to recommend what to breed to your wizard of Oz because
[14:11.060 --> 14:13.940]  first off, I don't know what the wizard of Oz is.
[14:13.940 --> 14:18.580]  I don't know what it looks like, smells like, and even if I had a good written description
[14:18.580 --> 14:23.260]  of it, if it said here that it smells like pine trees and grows like this, how do I know
[14:23.260 --> 14:25.480]  that that's the phenotype you're going to get?
[14:25.480 --> 14:29.420]  Maybe you selected a phenotype that smells like bubble gum and gets real tall and skinny
[14:29.420 --> 14:31.100]  and I don't know that.
[14:31.100 --> 14:33.500]  It's hard to decide what to tell you to cross it with.
[14:33.500 --> 14:37.420]  And then you're going to get different phenotypes from my crosses as well.
[14:37.420 --> 14:40.760]  Some things will get, if you cross something that's real strawberry and something that's
[14:40.760 --> 14:44.080]  real gassy, some phenotypes are going to lean real strawberry.
[14:44.080 --> 14:46.560]  Some phenotypes are going to lean real gas and guess what?
[14:46.560 --> 14:49.440]  Some be strawberry gas, perfect up the middle.
[14:49.440 --> 14:51.400]  You're going to get others that are totally random shit.
[14:51.400 --> 14:55.040]  You'll get bubble gum and turpentine out of some of them, but that's just outliers because
[14:55.040 --> 14:56.880]  that's how genetics and nature works.
[14:56.880 --> 15:01.480]  There's nothing stopping you from breeding with multiple female plants at one time.
[15:01.480 --> 15:05.720]  You can get one dude and as long as that one dude makes enough pollen, you can pollinate
[15:05.720 --> 15:08.400]  as many females that are in the room.
[15:08.400 --> 15:12.560]  I allegedly have a greenhouse going right now with King Solomon sitting right in the
[15:12.560 --> 15:13.560]  middle.
[15:13.560 --> 15:15.400]  He's actually, he served his purpose.
[15:15.400 --> 15:16.400]  He did his job.
[15:16.400 --> 15:18.280]  He made a fucking mess.
[15:18.280 --> 15:19.600]  Everybody's pregnant.
[15:19.600 --> 15:20.600]  How would Tracy Morgan do it?
[15:20.600 --> 15:21.600]  He got everyone pregnant.
[15:21.600 --> 15:22.600]  Are they pregnant?
[15:22.600 --> 15:24.560]  I can't do a good Tracy Morgan on the spot.
[15:24.560 --> 15:27.440]  I wasn't prepared, but you know what I'm saying.
[15:27.440 --> 15:29.840]  Everyone got pregnant tonight.
[15:29.840 --> 15:30.840]  Shout out to Tracy Morgan.
[15:30.840 --> 15:34.000]  He got everybody pregnant, not Tracy Morgan, King Solomon got everybody pregnant in that
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.320]  greenhouse and he got one, two.
[15:36.320 --> 15:41.080]  I think he pollinated 12 other, he pollinated 12 female plants.
[15:41.080 --> 15:44.080]  So there are 12 outdoor plants got pollinated by one plant.
[15:44.080 --> 15:49.560]  When I go indoors, I usually do one male per one or two lights.
[15:49.560 --> 15:54.520]  So I've got a light of female plants and one male plant per light, maybe sometimes two,
[15:54.520 --> 15:58.440]  depending on how big the overall plants are, how big the dude is.
[15:58.440 --> 16:03.380]  But I'll put several females to King Solomon most of the time or several females to Jack
[16:03.380 --> 16:06.500]  the Ripper or several females to a reversed golden goat.
[16:06.500 --> 16:08.180]  That way you can make multiple things.
[16:08.180 --> 16:10.500]  And then that way you run those multiple.
[16:10.500 --> 16:15.700]  So you put, let's for example, say we put your, let's just take the wizard of Oz male
[16:15.700 --> 16:17.780]  and we'll pollinate strawberry starburst.
[16:17.780 --> 16:22.900]  We'll pollinate sun kiss and then we'll also pollinate Jack the Ripper and we'll grow seeds
[16:22.900 --> 16:24.380]  from all of those.
[16:24.380 --> 16:27.840]  And we've grown the strawberry starburst, the sun kiss and the Jack the Ripper times
[16:27.840 --> 16:30.900]  enough to where we know what they do when you grow them.
[16:30.900 --> 16:35.700]  They know how they respond and react to different environments, feedings, conditions, abuses,
[16:35.700 --> 16:36.700]  stresses.
[16:36.700 --> 16:37.780]  We know what they're resistant to.
[16:37.780 --> 16:40.100]  We know what they're really susceptible to.
[16:40.100 --> 16:41.840]  We know how long they take to flower.
[16:41.840 --> 16:43.460]  So we know those plants very well, right?
[16:43.460 --> 16:45.600]  We've got a relationship with those.
[16:45.600 --> 16:49.660]  Then we cross them with your male wizard of Oz.
[16:49.660 --> 16:52.600]  Then you grow the seeds that come from those plants.
[16:52.600 --> 16:56.400]  And then we get to see what the male is doing to each different cross.
[16:56.400 --> 17:01.240]  So if we see that normally the strawberry starburst was tall and had skinny leaves and
[17:01.240 --> 17:06.680]  long lanky buds and smells like strawberries and the sun kisses kind of, it's not as tall,
[17:06.680 --> 17:11.120]  but it's got that rounder structure and the wide plant structure and smells like oranges.
[17:11.120 --> 17:14.400]  Then we grow up the progeny that came from those crosses and we see that they both have
[17:14.400 --> 17:16.280]  a spicy apple flavor.
[17:16.280 --> 17:20.680]  We know that your wizard of Oz is contributing a spicy apple to everything.
[17:20.680 --> 17:23.440]  That's kind of one of his traits, what we know he does.
[17:23.440 --> 17:24.880]  That's how you test out a male plant.
[17:24.880 --> 17:29.920]  It's the only real way to test out a boy is to pollinate a bunch of things, grow them,
[17:29.920 --> 17:34.360]  and then find commonalities amongst those different crosses to find out what he's doing.
[17:34.360 --> 17:39.640]  That's how I know so well what my King Solomon plant does to other plants when I cross it.
[17:39.640 --> 17:41.480]  It's very predictable for me.
[17:41.480 --> 17:46.960]  Eight out of 10 times by now, I can say, if we hit that plant with King Solomon, it's
[17:46.960 --> 17:48.640]  going to do this.
[17:48.640 --> 17:49.640]  And I can predict it.
[17:49.640 --> 17:52.680]  I'll write it down on paper and I'll say, bro, we're going to get this out of it.
[17:52.680 --> 17:53.840]  And then we'll do it.
[17:53.840 --> 17:57.120]  And then whoever I'll pollinate the plants, I'll give seeds to people and I'll say, expect
[17:57.120 --> 17:58.520]  this, watch out for this.
[17:58.520 --> 17:59.520]  And they'll message me back.
[17:59.520 --> 18:01.520]  They'll be like, bro, I thought you said it's a tester.
[18:01.520 --> 18:02.760]  I never, you never grew it.
[18:02.760 --> 18:04.160]  How'd you know what it was going to do?
[18:04.160 --> 18:08.440]  And I'm like, well, I know both the parents so well that I know that Strawberry Starburst
[18:08.440 --> 18:09.480]  grows tall.
[18:09.480 --> 18:11.040]  She gets skinny around week six.
[18:11.040 --> 18:12.560]  She starts yellowing up real bad.
[18:12.560 --> 18:15.440]  You want to give her extra nutrients, but don't because you'll burn her.
[18:15.440 --> 18:16.560]  She just kind of yellows out.
[18:16.560 --> 18:17.560]  That's what she does.
[18:17.560 --> 18:22.180]  And then I know that this other plant over here, around week nine, it really starts beefing
[18:22.180 --> 18:25.540]  up so that I know that the offspring around week seven, they're probably going to get
[18:25.540 --> 18:26.640]  yellow and beef up.
[18:26.640 --> 18:29.940]  That's just the kind of math that my brain understands how to do with these plants.
[18:29.940 --> 18:30.940]  They're my kids.
[18:30.940 --> 18:31.940]  I know them.
[18:31.940 --> 18:34.940]  I know that that one is going to be an honoree bitch one night and that one's going to be
[18:34.940 --> 18:37.620]  really a pain in the ass in the mornings, but Saturday morning, they're going to get
[18:37.620 --> 18:38.620]  along.
[18:38.620 --> 18:39.620]  It's going to be cool.
[18:39.620 --> 18:40.620]  Just shit like that.
[18:40.620 --> 18:41.620]  You know it.
[18:41.620 --> 18:42.620]  That's how the plants are.
[18:42.620 --> 18:43.620]  Tell them what the plants, they talk to me, they tell me.
[18:43.620 --> 18:44.620]  All right.
[18:44.620 --> 18:50.380]  I feel like I've been rambling for a very long time about this one, but honestly, breeding
[18:50.460 --> 18:52.540]  is all about your purpose and your goal.
[18:52.540 --> 18:56.320]  Breed with intent, breed with purpose, have a goal.
[18:56.320 --> 18:57.380]  Do what I do.
[18:57.380 --> 18:58.380]  Challenge yourself.
[18:58.380 --> 19:03.060]  No matter which plants you use, just get a piece of paper and write down, I'm going to
[19:03.060 --> 19:05.140]  cross and I'm just being hypothetical.
[19:05.140 --> 19:08.620]  You can use any plants in your garden that you choose to work with and you've got my
[19:08.620 --> 19:13.100]  permission, my blessing, my honor to breed with my seeds.
[19:13.100 --> 19:17.060]  All of you guys out there, gals out there, anybody that wants to play with my seeds and
[19:17.060 --> 19:19.120]  do some pollen chucking, please do.
[19:19.120 --> 19:21.240]  If you make a seed company out of it, give me some credit.
[19:21.240 --> 19:24.720]  Give me a shout out, say, learn some shit from Ross to Jeff.
[19:24.720 --> 19:27.400]  But I encourage you to breed with my stuff.
[19:27.400 --> 19:29.160]  The main thing is that you've got a goal.
[19:29.160 --> 19:30.160]  All right.
[19:30.160 --> 19:32.480]  I told you I took some fat dabs, but I finally remember what the fuck I was saying.
[19:32.480 --> 19:33.480]  I just had to ramble it out.
[19:33.480 --> 19:35.520]  I may have cut some of the rambling out.
[19:35.520 --> 19:36.520]  That's the magic of editing.
[19:36.520 --> 19:39.040]  And I better say it before I fucking forget what I was saying.
[19:39.040 --> 19:40.360]  Again, here's a challenge.
[19:40.360 --> 19:43.120]  When you're going to do some breeding and you've got the blessings to breed with my
[19:43.120 --> 19:46.080]  plants, your plants, whatever plants you want to choose, nobody should say you can't breed
[19:46.080 --> 19:47.080]  with their seeds.
[19:47.080 --> 19:48.220]  Once you buy them, they're yours.
[19:48.320 --> 19:49.320]  That's my opinion.
[19:49.320 --> 19:50.320]  Do your thing.
[19:50.320 --> 19:55.180]  But write down, I'm going to breed my Wizard of Oz to Strawberry Starburst.
[19:55.180 --> 19:57.660]  I'm going to breed Wizard of Oz to Cindy 99.
[19:57.660 --> 20:02.940]  I'm going to breed Wizard of Oz to something from Colin and something from Miss Jill.
[20:02.940 --> 20:07.800]  Just breed to a bunch of different things, but write down your expected outcome.
[20:07.800 --> 20:09.600]  I think that's called your hypothesis.
[20:09.600 --> 20:12.540]  Write down your predictions, what you think.
[20:12.540 --> 20:15.520]  So like I'm going to put this Wizard of Oz to Strawberry Starburst.
[20:15.520 --> 20:19.240]  I'm hoping I get high potency Strawberry Turps.
[20:19.240 --> 20:22.480]  And then think of what may kind of not be the super coolest trait.
[20:22.480 --> 20:25.440]  Everything's going to have a negative trait to it.
[20:25.440 --> 20:27.280]  What's the downside to all these bonus traits?
[20:27.280 --> 20:28.400]  See where that is.
[20:28.400 --> 20:29.960]  Just see what you can predict.
[20:29.960 --> 20:33.800]  And then every time you breed again, keep writing down your predictions and you'll start
[20:33.800 --> 20:37.920]  seeing what you can do and what you can predict and what you can rely on and what the plants
[20:37.920 --> 20:41.320]  do repeatedly over and over when you breed with them.
[20:41.320 --> 20:43.960]  And then you'll learn this dude is great to breed with.
[20:43.960 --> 20:45.560]  This girl plant is good to breed with.
[20:45.560 --> 20:49.320]  Then you'll start playing with different male plants and you'll start seeing what different
[20:49.320 --> 20:51.640]  boy and girl combinations do to each other.
[20:51.640 --> 20:54.760]  And you'll realize this male and this female work real well together.
[20:54.760 --> 20:58.800]  But when I breed this male and this female together, it doesn't work worth a shit for
[20:58.800 --> 20:59.800]  some reason.
[20:59.800 --> 21:03.360]  You'll find combos that are magic and some that are mediocre and some that you wish you
[21:03.360 --> 21:06.600]  never made because you end up throwing away big baggies filled with seeds.
[21:06.600 --> 21:09.160]  You feed them to the birds, you flush them down the toilet.
[21:09.160 --> 21:10.160]  Don't give those to your friends.
[21:10.160 --> 21:11.160]  All right.
[21:11.160 --> 21:15.240]  I think I've rambled on for extra time that I needed to on this one.
[21:15.240 --> 21:16.880]  My buddy, where's your name in this one?
[21:16.880 --> 21:18.880]  I already fucking lost your name in this one.
[21:18.880 --> 21:21.400]  Warwick, my friend, my bro.
[21:21.400 --> 21:22.960]  Thank you for the great message.
[21:22.960 --> 21:27.080]  And if you've got any follow up questions, I would love to talk more about this.
[21:27.080 --> 21:31.240]  Send me some more details and maybe we can steer you on the right path, get you down
[21:31.240 --> 21:33.000]  the right track.
[21:33.000 --> 21:36.380]  But man, just follow your heart, grow from your heart and breed with love, brother.
[21:36.380 --> 21:39.080]  That's what I really think you should and need to do.
[21:39.080 --> 21:41.960]  Feed these, grow these plants out, see what speaks to you.
[21:41.960 --> 21:44.160]  And then you're like, you're like the matchmaker.
[21:44.160 --> 21:45.360]  You're the guy on the dating game.
[21:45.360 --> 21:47.680]  You just got to set them up and hope they get along.
[21:47.680 --> 21:49.400]  You are the new plant tender.
[21:49.400 --> 21:53.140]  Now, I do have one more message in front of me that I'm going to read on this episode.
[21:53.140 --> 21:55.920]  This message right here comes from my friend Squirrel Master.
[21:55.920 --> 21:57.360]  What up, Squirrel Master?
[21:57.360 --> 21:58.360]  Good to see you, brother.
[21:58.360 --> 21:59.360]  Hope you are well.
[21:59.360 --> 22:00.900]  Thank you for being a part of the IRIE army.
[22:00.900 --> 22:03.640]  It's good to have you on team IRIE genetics.
[22:03.640 --> 22:07.840]  This message from my buddy Squirrel Master goes a little bit like this.
[22:07.840 --> 22:10.960]  It says, I'm sorry if I've asked this before, I can't remember.
[22:10.960 --> 22:12.880]  Dude, I've done 600.
[22:12.880 --> 22:16.080]  This is episode 675.
[22:16.080 --> 22:17.480]  I don't remember either.
[22:17.480 --> 22:21.220]  So if you already did, hopefully everybody forgot because I did.
[22:21.220 --> 22:22.980]  So did you.
[22:22.980 --> 22:25.200]  Hopefully everybody's smoking as much as we are.
[22:25.200 --> 22:26.520]  Any who, any how, any way.
[22:26.520 --> 22:27.520]  It goes like this.
[22:27.520 --> 22:29.840]  This is Squirrel Master.
[22:29.840 --> 22:31.640]  You should get that tattooed on your forearms.
[22:31.640 --> 22:35.840]  Put your arms like this together and then get this is Squirrel Master tattooed on your
[22:35.840 --> 22:36.840]  forearms.
[22:36.840 --> 22:38.600]  That's fucking gnarly.
[22:38.600 --> 22:39.600]  Big up Squirrel Master.
[22:39.600 --> 22:45.240]  It says, I was wondering about light leaks and interruptions in the vegetative phase.
[22:45.240 --> 22:50.040]  Will this affect a vegging plant to the point where it causes herming or other things when
[22:50.040 --> 22:54.320]  the plants are flowering?
[22:54.320 --> 22:58.400]  Light interruptions during veg won't be major and catastrophic.
[22:58.400 --> 23:02.800]  If you do it on purpose multiple times, the plant may start tripping out on you and may
[23:02.800 --> 23:06.120]  show you some frustration, some hormonal problems.
[23:06.120 --> 23:12.800]  But you can basically manipulate that light pretty well a couple of times in veg.
[23:12.800 --> 23:15.560]  Maybe you want to go from like, maybe you just want to completely change the schedule.
[23:15.560 --> 23:16.840]  Yeah, do it one time.
[23:16.840 --> 23:17.840]  They won't notice.
[23:17.840 --> 23:18.840]  They'll go, what the fuck was that?
[23:18.840 --> 23:19.840]  Then they'll just keep growing.
[23:19.840 --> 23:23.920]  If you do it like today and then again in three days and again in a few days, they may
[23:23.920 --> 23:27.560]  start getting weird shaped leaves because they're just not sure what to do.
[23:27.560 --> 23:31.080]  They'll react just like you, bro.
[23:31.080 --> 23:33.480]  Once or twice, they'll be like, what the fuck was that?
[23:33.480 --> 23:34.680]  And they'll get right back on track.
[23:34.680 --> 23:37.360]  But if you do it a few times, they're going to want to talk to the manager.
[23:37.360 --> 23:39.440]  They're going to be like, what the fuck is going on?
[23:39.440 --> 23:40.600]  Why do you keep waking me up?
[23:40.600 --> 23:41.760]  Why am I sleeping?
[23:41.760 --> 23:42.920]  Then why are the lights back on?
[23:42.920 --> 23:45.600]  And why is it sunshiny at three in the morning?
[23:45.600 --> 23:46.600]  What's happening?
[23:46.600 --> 23:51.120]  But if you do it a couple of times, mess with them a little bit in veg, they will be okay.
[23:51.120 --> 23:55.660]  Try to get them back on a good day night cycle, a good rhythm before you put them into flower
[23:55.660 --> 23:59.880]  so that they know like, oh, I've been on 18-6 and they kind of have an idea.
[23:59.880 --> 24:02.200]  And then when you switch to 12-12, they'll notice the back.
[24:02.200 --> 24:06.880]  Oh, now it's actually 12-12 because if you have a chaotic schedule, chaos, chaos, then
[24:06.880 --> 24:08.520]  you go to 12-12, they're going to be confused.
[24:08.520 --> 24:10.080]  It'll take a little bit longer.
[24:10.080 --> 24:13.960]  I would expect for them to realize, oh, that's really 12-12.
[24:13.960 --> 24:17.360]  I really should go into bloom.
[24:17.360 --> 24:22.240]  So I would give them minimal interruptions as close to flower as possible, but I don't
[24:22.240 --> 24:25.880]  think that it will cause major problems, major concerns.
[24:25.880 --> 24:29.320]  Now in the flowering phase, I would really try to avoid light leaks at all costs.
[24:29.760 --> 24:32.440]  I don't want light leaks, light interruption, schedule changes.
[24:32.440 --> 24:36.560]  I really try to keep that locked in once I'm in the flowering phase.
[24:36.560 --> 24:38.240]  That is where you will see issues.
[24:38.240 --> 24:41.920]  You possibly will lead to intersex expressions of your plants.
[24:41.920 --> 24:47.040]  You'll start seeing possible reveg, start seeing possible twisty, coily leaves, maybe
[24:47.040 --> 24:48.200]  slow.
[24:48.200 --> 24:50.500]  The real word is retarded growth.
[24:50.500 --> 24:51.680]  Don't flag me for that one.
[24:51.680 --> 24:52.920]  That's the real word.
[24:52.920 --> 24:56.720]  The growth of the plant will be retarded because the light schedule is interrupted.
[24:56.720 --> 24:58.960]  It won't look like it's blooming the way that it should.
[24:58.960 --> 25:02.720]  You'll think you're in a flowering stage, but since you're getting a light leak, the
[25:02.720 --> 25:03.720]  plant just won't go into flower.
[25:03.720 --> 25:05.040]  It's like, no, it's still light.
[25:05.040 --> 25:08.480]  There's a little bit of light, so I'm supposed to stay in the vegetative stage.
[25:08.480 --> 25:13.380]  So make sure you've got full darkness in flower, but in the vegetative stage, you will be okay
[25:13.380 --> 25:17.120]  as long as you're not out there fucking with the breaker, just making sure they're off
[25:17.120 --> 25:18.120]  and on.
[25:18.120 --> 25:19.120]  Don't turn it into a rave.
[25:19.120 --> 25:23.080]  Let's not have a party in the grow room, but a couple of interruptions and I think you
[25:23.080 --> 25:24.600]  will be just fine.
[25:24.600 --> 25:27.240]  All right, let me scroll through and make sure I've covered my notes.
[25:27.240 --> 25:31.480]  Yes, I feel like I have covered the major part of the show I wanted to get through.
[25:31.480 --> 25:33.640]  Now it is time to wrap up this podcast.
