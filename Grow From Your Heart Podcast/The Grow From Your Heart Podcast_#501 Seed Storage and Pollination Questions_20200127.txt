[00:00.890 --> 00:30.980]  Welcome back, Podcast World.
[00:30.980 --> 00:35.520]  It's time for episode 501 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:35.520 --> 00:39.300]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[00:39.300 --> 00:43.880]  If you need new regular, feminized, or auto flower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend
[00:43.880 --> 00:52.480]  Seeds Here Now, and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:52.480 --> 00:55.840]  You know I like to start the show off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:55.840 --> 01:01.260]  Today, I've been taking dabs of iScream Live Batter from Green Dot Labs.
[01:01.260 --> 01:04.820]  This is a blend of I-95 and Screamin' OG.
[01:04.820 --> 01:10.300]  On the package, the flavor is described as gas, mothballs, and fabric softener.
[01:10.300 --> 01:12.100]  I absolutely get the gas.
[01:12.100 --> 01:13.540]  I get the mothballs.
[01:13.540 --> 01:19.160]  I'm not sure about the fabric softener, but I definitely get a punch to the face.
[01:19.160 --> 01:24.620]  This is amazing, tremendously delicious concentrate, and it wrecks me and makes me slow, and I
[01:24.620 --> 01:26.060]  really like it.
[01:26.060 --> 01:33.340]  On the back of the package, it does say that this product does contain 64.04% THC and non-detectable
[01:33.340 --> 01:35.300]  amounts of CBD.
[01:35.300 --> 01:42.540]  Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious iScream Live Batter.
[01:42.540 --> 01:46.940]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes, smokers and growers,
[01:46.940 --> 01:51.480]  all you bad motherfuckers out there, in this episode, I'm going to read some emails from
[01:51.480 --> 01:52.480]  some listeners.
[01:52.480 --> 01:57.240]  Before we get there, let's do some shout outs to a few of our friends who support the
[01:57.240 --> 01:59.740]  show on Patreon.
[01:59.740 --> 02:02.960]  Let's start off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast high five, shout out, and a
[02:02.960 --> 02:07.200]  thank you to our new friend, Michael W. Let's send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank
[02:07.200 --> 02:11.240]  you to Paul A. I want to send a giant thank you to our friend Bjorn.
[02:11.240 --> 02:14.560]  Always want to send a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast high five and a thank you to
[02:14.560 --> 02:18.980]  David O. I also want to send a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast fist bump and a high
[02:18.980 --> 02:21.520]  five to our friend NorCal Irie.
[02:21.560 --> 02:25.900]  We also owe a big high five and a shout out to Mark M. I always need to send a Grow From
[02:25.900 --> 02:29.220]  Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to our friend Riley.
[02:29.220 --> 02:32.280]  Let's not forget about Farmer John out there working on the farm.
[02:32.280 --> 02:35.840]  I also want to send a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to Mason
[02:35.840 --> 02:37.500]  662.
[02:37.500 --> 02:42.560]  We always need to send a big thank you to Daniel R. And last, but certainly not least,
[02:42.560 --> 02:48.640]  let's send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to my friend Glenn Gironi.
[02:48.640 --> 02:53.580]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who has continued to support the show on Patreon.
[02:53.580 --> 02:58.360]  Alright, I did say we were going to read a couple of listener emails in this episode.
[02:58.360 --> 03:03.520]  Before we get there, let's do a quick update of what's going on in my breeding garden.
[03:03.520 --> 03:08.620]  If you've been following along, you know I am replenishing the TMNT line.
[03:08.620 --> 03:12.700]  I've been saying that those should finish at the end of January to be available at the
[03:12.700 --> 03:14.980]  beginning or middle of February.
[03:14.980 --> 03:19.000]  And as of now, it looks like those seeds are right on schedule.
[03:19.000 --> 03:25.380]  So by the middle of February, we should have more of the TMNT line available in its brand
[03:25.380 --> 03:26.380]  new packaging.
[03:26.380 --> 03:27.380]  What?
[03:27.380 --> 03:31.460]  That's right, I got brand new custom packaging for each strain.
[03:31.460 --> 03:32.460]  You will love it.
[03:32.460 --> 03:33.460]  Stay tuned.
[03:33.460 --> 03:34.460]  You'll see that in February.
[03:34.460 --> 03:36.520]  Alright, that's a garden update.
[03:36.520 --> 03:41.820]  Now let's jump into some of the questions and emails that came from my listeners.
[03:41.820 --> 03:44.620]  Let's start off with the question I get asked a lot.
[03:44.620 --> 03:48.820]  And as an event is approaching, I get this question more and more.
[03:48.820 --> 03:53.540]  There are a lot of people coming from out of state for the Indo Expo.
[03:53.540 --> 03:57.300]  By the time you hear this episode, the Indo Expo will have just happened in Denver.
[03:57.300 --> 04:02.240]  It is a very large cannabis and cultivation based trade show.
[04:02.240 --> 04:06.080]  People come from all over the world, all over the country for this event.
[04:06.080 --> 04:11.000]  A large portion of the people that come for that event and events like it want to find
[04:11.180 --> 04:15.980]  and consume legal cannabis while they are here visiting Colorado.
[04:15.980 --> 04:20.940]  Many of those people reach out to me asking for dispensary recommendations and recommendations
[04:20.940 --> 04:25.780]  on places to go and things to do while they are in Denver or while they're in Colorado.
[04:25.780 --> 04:32.180]  And a lot of those people also ask where they can find Irie Genetics flowers on the shelf
[04:32.180 --> 04:33.700]  at a dispensary.
[04:33.700 --> 04:38.820]  I do have a few dispensary recommendations based on personal experience.
[04:38.840 --> 04:43.120]  Nobody pays me or promotes the show, so I don't have any preferential treatment to a
[04:43.120 --> 04:45.280]  dispensary because of any financial gain.
[04:45.280 --> 04:49.100]  It is all because of my personal experience and the quality of the product I have found
[04:49.100 --> 04:50.460]  at places.
[04:50.460 --> 04:55.660]  But unfortunately, most of the time, I do not know where they have got any of my strains
[04:55.660 --> 04:57.000]  on the shelf.
[04:57.000 --> 05:03.160]  Colorado is loaded with legal, commercial, medical, and recreational grows up and down
[05:03.160 --> 05:04.400]  the state.
[05:04.400 --> 05:09.020]  Many of those grows are wholesale grows, which means they grow a large amount of product
[05:09.020 --> 05:13.180]  and then they wholesale several pounds to this dispensary and several pounds to that
[05:13.180 --> 05:15.540]  dispensary and some to that dispensary.
[05:15.540 --> 05:17.660]  So who knows where that flower goes?
[05:17.660 --> 05:22.860]  Also, some of the dispensaries have a vertical integration system, which means they grow
[05:22.860 --> 05:24.420]  most of their flower.
[05:24.420 --> 05:28.540]  It's grown in a grow facility, which they own, and then it is passed right through their
[05:28.540 --> 05:29.620]  store.
[05:29.620 --> 05:35.120]  There is really no way for me to know who has got clones of my genetics.
[05:35.120 --> 05:38.520]  There's no way for me to keep track of that here in the Colorado system.
[05:38.520 --> 05:42.560]  I can't punch in something and say, who's got lemon Jeffrey in the system and see who's
[05:42.560 --> 05:43.560]  got the plants.
[05:43.560 --> 05:47.120]  I probably could if I tried to do some digging in the system, but that's not something that
[05:47.120 --> 05:48.120]  I would normally do.
[05:48.120 --> 05:52.560]  I don't know if I've even got access to other facilities like that to see if they've got
[05:52.560 --> 05:55.840]  a lemon Jeffrey plant or something like that in their system.
[05:55.840 --> 05:58.880]  So there's no way for me to really know who has got the clones.
[05:58.880 --> 06:01.100]  There's no way for me to know who is growing it.
[06:01.100 --> 06:03.540]  Then there's no way for me to know who has flowered it.
[06:03.540 --> 06:06.860]  And once it's flowered, there's no way for me to know where it has gone.
[06:06.860 --> 06:11.820]  So my genetics could be everywhere and they could be nowhere in a Colorado dispensary
[06:11.820 --> 06:13.340]  at this time.
[06:13.340 --> 06:17.020]  The only thing I can recommend is that you use some of the applications.
[06:17.020 --> 06:21.780]  There are apps you can download for your phone and you're able to search menus through dispensaries.
[06:21.780 --> 06:27.060]  The downside to that is many of the dispensaries do not update their menus.
[06:27.200 --> 06:31.840]  If there is a specific IRI genetics strain, which you are looking for while you're visiting
[06:31.840 --> 06:37.000]  Colorado, maybe open up Weedmaps, type in the name of that strain, see if it comes up,
[06:37.000 --> 06:39.560]  see if a dispensary in your area has it.
[06:39.560 --> 06:43.280]  And if they've got it, head over there and hope that they have updated that menu recently
[06:43.280 --> 06:45.320]  and they've still got some on the shelf.
[06:45.320 --> 06:47.240]  I know a lot of people don't like Weedmaps.
[06:47.240 --> 06:52.240]  A lot of people also do not like Leafly, but that may be another resource to find the strains
[06:52.240 --> 06:53.680]  you were looking for.
[06:53.680 --> 06:58.080]  Neither one of those companies pay me, but they are resources that are available to consumers
[06:58.080 --> 07:00.740]  to find the products they are searching for.
[07:00.740 --> 07:06.760]  So unfortunately, I do not have a way to know where my genetics are in the Colorado market.
[07:06.760 --> 07:10.540]  In other places with legalized cannabis, they do have better systems where the breeders
[07:10.540 --> 07:15.700]  actually get kickbacks for every clone that is cut from one of their genetics, from one
[07:15.700 --> 07:17.020]  of their crosses.
[07:17.020 --> 07:19.580]  But that is another story for another time.
[07:19.580 --> 07:21.220]  All right, let's keep moving forward.
[07:21.220 --> 07:23.180]  I do have another great email.
[07:23.180 --> 07:27.660]  This email comes from somebody who just signed their message with A. So big shout out to
[07:27.660 --> 07:32.680]  our new friend A. The message from A goes just like this.
[07:32.680 --> 07:38.180]  I have not come across you talking about seed long-term storage.
[07:38.180 --> 07:41.420]  If it's covered already, it would be great to know the episode number.
[07:41.420 --> 07:46.260]  If not, can we get your input, opinions, and recommendations?
[07:46.260 --> 07:49.660]  Peace from A. That's a very good question.
[07:49.660 --> 07:54.980]  A, I don't think I have done an episode on seed storage and preservation.
[07:54.980 --> 07:59.380]  So let's do a quick talk about storing your seeds.
[07:59.380 --> 08:03.320]  I think the most important thing to think about when you are storing seeds is that they
[08:03.320 --> 08:06.060]  stay dry, very dry.
[08:06.060 --> 08:10.020]  If you have harvested your own seeds, leave them out in the open to where they can dry
[08:10.020 --> 08:13.820]  before you ever put them into any type of a container.
[08:13.820 --> 08:16.500]  Seeds can get moldy just like buds.
[08:16.500 --> 08:21.000]  If they haven't dried, they do run the risk of getting a little moldy film on the outside.
[08:21.000 --> 08:25.460]  That will cause germination problems that can possibly slow down your seeds.
[08:25.460 --> 08:30.940]  Also, if they are kept too moist, that will encourage your seed to germinate.
[08:30.940 --> 08:36.360]  So keep those seeds as dry as you can until you are ready to use them.
[08:36.360 --> 08:40.980]  When you are storing your seeds, I recommend storing them with some sort of a silicate
[08:40.980 --> 08:42.380]  package.
[08:42.380 --> 08:44.340]  And I mean a silicate pack.
[08:44.340 --> 08:46.740]  Do not use a Boveda pack.
[08:46.740 --> 08:48.980]  We want to suck the moisture out.
[08:48.980 --> 08:53.100]  The silicate pack will absorb the moisture and keep that away from the seeds.
[08:53.100 --> 08:58.280]  A Boveda pack will actually reintroduce moisture into your sealed container, and that is not
[08:58.280 --> 08:59.840]  what we want for the seeds.
[08:59.840 --> 09:01.200]  We want dryness.
[09:01.200 --> 09:06.100]  So I would recommend whatever you store your seeds in, that you put a silicate pack or
[09:06.100 --> 09:08.860]  a desiccant pack in with those seeds.
[09:08.860 --> 09:13.900]  You can also use dried rice if you don't have a silicate or desiccant pack.
[09:14.460 --> 09:18.140]  But again, make sure it is completely dried, like the boxed rice.
[09:18.140 --> 09:21.980]  It's the same idea as if you drop your phone or some sort of electronics into the pool
[09:21.980 --> 09:23.300]  or into water.
[09:23.300 --> 09:28.840]  They say to drop your phone or your electronics into a bag of dry rice, and that rice will
[09:28.840 --> 09:32.960]  absorb the water and help dry out your electronic device more quickly.
[09:32.960 --> 09:34.380]  This is the same approach.
[09:34.380 --> 09:38.540]  We're trying to get the moisture away from our seeds.
[09:38.540 --> 09:42.500]  So in my opinion, one of the most important things to think about is moisture.
[09:42.500 --> 09:45.640]  Get that moisture away from those seeds.
[09:45.640 --> 09:47.240]  Don't seal them up when they're wet.
[09:47.240 --> 09:51.580]  Don't leave the buds with the seeds sitting around in something sealed because those buds
[09:51.580 --> 09:55.860]  will get moldy and the seeds will have a little moldy film on them.
[09:55.860 --> 09:59.880]  When you drop those seeds in water, you'll see a little white cloud come up off the seed.
[09:59.880 --> 10:04.240]  That is a little bit of mold that has grown on the seed from being sealed in a container
[10:04.240 --> 10:08.780]  with too much moisture and just enough heat to make a moldy environment.
[10:08.780 --> 10:13.040]  You have many options of containers for storing your seeds.
[10:13.040 --> 10:18.500]  Whatever you choose to use, I suggest you make some sort of effort to keep light away
[10:18.500 --> 10:20.340]  from those seeds.
[10:20.340 --> 10:21.840]  Don't get bright light on the seeds.
[10:21.840 --> 10:25.040]  We want them dry and dark.
[10:25.040 --> 10:29.180]  So keep that in mind when you were deciding which kind of container in which to keep your
[10:29.180 --> 10:30.180]  seeds.
[10:30.180 --> 10:33.740]  If you're using seeds that you bought from a breeder or a vendor, they should be packaged
[10:33.740 --> 10:35.860]  in something that keeps the light out already.
[10:35.860 --> 10:40.740]  My seeds are already sold in a package that does not allow light to get to the seeds.
[10:40.740 --> 10:43.420]  They're also very clearly labeled.
[10:43.420 --> 10:49.060]  If you've got more than one strain or variety of seeds in your collection, I recommend you
[10:49.060 --> 10:51.060]  label it very carefully.
[10:51.060 --> 10:53.020]  I like to put the strain name.
[10:53.020 --> 10:57.860]  I like to put the cross and sometimes I will even put the date on which I started storing
[10:57.860 --> 10:59.660]  those seeds on the container.
[10:59.660 --> 11:01.700]  So you've got a lot of options.
[11:01.700 --> 11:06.180]  You can just put a bunch of seeds in some baggies and label those baggies and roll those
[11:06.180 --> 11:10.260]  baggies up and then throw all of those baggies into one container.
[11:10.260 --> 11:11.260]  You can do that.
[11:11.260 --> 11:13.760]  Then you can store that wherever you feel is safe.
[11:13.760 --> 11:17.540]  We have got several options for seed storage in this type of setup.
[11:17.540 --> 11:21.980]  I recommend that it is dry and dark and also cool.
[11:21.980 --> 11:28.020]  Two of my favorite places to store seeds are in the crisper drawer in the refrigerator
[11:28.140 --> 11:32.620]  and also in a safe in a basement corner in Colorado.
[11:32.620 --> 11:34.940]  In Colorado, it never gets too warm in the basement.
[11:34.940 --> 11:37.920]  It's always going to be nice and chilled down in the basement.
[11:37.920 --> 11:39.980]  It's got that earth insulation.
[11:39.980 --> 11:43.900]  You put a safe down there, you put all the seeds in a safe and those seeds will stay
[11:43.900 --> 11:45.460]  nice and cool.
[11:45.460 --> 11:52.020]  If you are going to put the seeds in the crisper drawer in the refrigerator, I do highly recommend
[11:52.020 --> 11:57.380]  you put the silicate pack in with the seeds, then seal that container, then put all of
[11:57.380 --> 12:03.380]  your seeds in another container and seal that master container so that no moisture
[12:03.380 --> 12:06.860]  ever makes contact with your seeds.
[12:06.860 --> 12:10.100]  Now if you are the kind of guy that likes to take the seeds out and show them off quite
[12:10.100 --> 12:13.140]  often, I may not refrigerate them.
[12:13.140 --> 12:18.200]  I don't like the idea of the seeds being nice and refrigerated and you bring them out occasionally,
[12:18.200 --> 12:22.220]  you show them to your friends, you have taken them from that cold environment to the normal
[12:22.220 --> 12:23.300]  atmosphere.
[12:23.300 --> 12:28.020]  You do run the risk of getting some kind of condensation happening when you're moving
[12:28.020 --> 12:30.180]  from environment to environment like that.
[12:30.180 --> 12:34.540]  So if you're going to store them in the fridge, leave them there until you are ready to grow
[12:34.540 --> 12:35.540]  them.
[12:35.540 --> 12:39.860]  I do not personally recommend freezing seeds.
[12:39.860 --> 12:41.860]  That is not how I store them.
[12:41.860 --> 12:48.660]  However, some of the largest and most relied upon seed storage facilities on the planet
[12:48.660 --> 12:50.580]  do store seeds.
[12:50.580 --> 12:55.500]  If you want to store seeds for very long-term storage, that is an option.
[12:55.500 --> 12:56.500]  I don't do it.
[12:56.500 --> 12:57.780]  I don't recommend it.
[12:57.780 --> 13:03.860]  But like I said, it is done on a large scale and it must work if that place is doing it.
[13:03.860 --> 13:10.060]  I have had great success with storing seeds in a safe or in a crisper drawer in a refrigerator
[13:10.060 --> 13:17.400]  for two or three years and those seeds are still highly viable and have a very high germination
[13:17.400 --> 13:20.800]  rate and are very active and successful seeds.
[13:20.800 --> 13:24.720]  I do not find a reason to freeze my seeds.
[13:24.720 --> 13:26.620]  Some people will freeze their seeds.
[13:26.620 --> 13:28.080]  Some people will recommend it.
[13:28.080 --> 13:29.440]  It will work for some people.
[13:29.440 --> 13:31.260]  It is just not my style.
[13:31.260 --> 13:34.620]  If you have got some seeds that you can experiment with, try it.
[13:34.620 --> 13:36.480]  See if that works for you.
[13:36.480 --> 13:42.340]  If you are going to freeze your seeds, I really want to repeat the part I said about not removing
[13:42.340 --> 13:47.980]  the seeds to show your friends or to look at them or just examine them or marvel at
[13:47.980 --> 13:49.100]  your collection.
[13:49.100 --> 13:54.300]  If you put those seeds in the freezer, leave them there until you are ready to germinate
[13:54.300 --> 13:55.300]  them.
[13:55.300 --> 14:00.140]  You are multiplying your risk of getting condensation in those seeds when you take them from that
[14:00.140 --> 14:03.220]  frozen environment to the non-frozen environment.
[14:03.220 --> 14:04.580]  They've got to thaw out.
[14:04.580 --> 14:06.660]  I don't know what kind of packaging they're in.
[14:06.660 --> 14:07.660]  Are we getting moisture?
[14:07.660 --> 14:09.980]  Are we getting frost inside of the package?
[14:09.980 --> 14:11.140]  Those are things to think about.
[14:11.140 --> 14:14.180]  I do not recommend freezing them in the first place.
[14:14.180 --> 14:18.820]  If you do, do not take them out and put them back and take them out and put them back just
[14:18.820 --> 14:20.300]  to enjoy the seeds.
[14:20.300 --> 14:23.880]  That's why I recommend something like a nice cool drawer in the basement.
[14:23.880 --> 14:26.600]  Maybe you've got a filing cabinet in a corner in the basement.
[14:26.600 --> 14:29.160]  That is probably a good idea, a good environment.
[14:29.160 --> 14:31.660]  Maybe you've got a crisper drawer in the refrigerator.
[14:31.660 --> 14:35.220]  That is cold enough to keep your seeds fresh and safe.
[14:35.220 --> 14:38.780]  Now I feel like I'm rambling because I'm stoned from those dabs, but let's recap a little
[14:38.780 --> 14:39.780]  bit.
[14:39.780 --> 14:42.660]  The first thing you need to think about are keep the seeds dry.
[14:42.660 --> 14:44.620]  Do not let moisture get to your seeds.
[14:44.620 --> 14:49.000]  Once they get wet, they are going to germinate or they are going to become non-viable.
[14:49.000 --> 14:50.300]  Keep them dry.
[14:50.300 --> 14:53.340]  Keep them in a cool, dark place.
[14:53.340 --> 14:56.040]  We don't need it frozen and we don't want it hot.
[14:56.040 --> 14:59.360]  We need it kind of cool and we want to keep them away from the light.
[14:59.360 --> 15:01.740]  The light and the water are what make them go.
[15:01.740 --> 15:04.620]  So let's not provide the triggers that will make these seeds germinate.
[15:04.620 --> 15:05.900]  Let's keep them dry.
[15:05.900 --> 15:08.900]  Let's keep them dark and let's try to keep them nice and cool.
[15:09.020 --> 15:10.020]  They still think it's winter.
[15:10.020 --> 15:13.140]  They're waiting for the spring to come around so they can germinate.
[15:13.140 --> 15:16.660]  Let's just keep them right there on hibernation mode until we're ready to use them.
[15:16.660 --> 15:17.660]  All right.
[15:17.660 --> 15:19.420]  I want to thank my friend A for the great email.
[15:19.420 --> 15:21.100]  I've got another message in front of me.
[15:21.100 --> 15:22.100]  Let's jump right to it.
[15:22.100 --> 15:28.260]  This one comes from Super Kev over at Garden City Genetics and the message goes just like
[15:28.260 --> 15:29.260]  this.
[15:29.260 --> 15:34.740]  Hey Rasta Jeff, I've been listening to your show for quite some time and I keep learning
[15:34.740 --> 15:36.100]  new things.
[15:36.100 --> 15:37.780]  That is a great way to start a message.
[15:37.780 --> 15:40.300]  I'm glad you're loving it and I'm glad you're learning from us.
[15:40.300 --> 15:45.460]  It goes on to say your show is definitely the tits as someone else recently described
[15:45.460 --> 15:46.460]  it.
[15:46.460 --> 15:47.460]  Man, that is awkward, but thank you.
[15:47.460 --> 15:49.380]  It says, feel free to use my name.
[15:49.380 --> 15:53.900]  My friends call me Super Kev and I'm located near Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
[15:53.900 --> 15:55.260]  What's up Super Kev?
[15:55.260 --> 15:59.940]  It says I've been growing for 20 years with many different growth styles, medium, lighting,
[15:59.940 --> 16:01.540]  genetics, et cetera.
[16:01.540 --> 16:07.260]  I'm a medicinal patient now, but I've been doing it since the good old bad days.
[16:07.260 --> 16:11.420]  I've gotten my feet wet with some breeding over the years and I've had some decent success
[16:11.420 --> 16:13.860]  and I've created a few winners.
[16:13.860 --> 16:19.140]  Currently, I have focused my efforts on breeding and I've started to work on my brand, which
[16:19.140 --> 16:21.020]  is Garden City Genetics.
[16:21.020 --> 16:22.740]  Hey, congratulations bro.
[16:22.740 --> 16:23.740]  That is a cool name.
[16:23.740 --> 16:27.600]  It sounds like you've got a lot of experience and most people who have been growing and
[16:27.600 --> 16:33.100]  playing that long, they do end up as breeders because that is just part of the passion.
[16:33.100 --> 16:35.500]  That leads us to the next part of the message.
[16:35.500 --> 16:41.100]  It says, I'm trying to learn as much as I can about proper techniques and tricks you
[16:41.100 --> 16:42.100]  may want to offer.
[16:42.100 --> 16:46.300]  I really enjoyed the last two breeding podcasts where you described the packaging terms in
[16:46.300 --> 16:49.700]  good detail and I'm hungry for more info.
[16:49.700 --> 16:53.340]  I am rambling, but I'll try to squeeze out a few questions.
[16:53.340 --> 16:56.120]  Hey, never apologize for rambling.
[16:56.120 --> 16:59.540]  This is the podcast for stoned rambles.
[16:59.540 --> 17:01.460]  So thank you for the great message so far.
[17:01.460 --> 17:03.580]  Let's get to the questions.
[17:03.580 --> 17:08.900]  It says, with limited space and plant count numbers, is it best to flower many males at
[17:08.900 --> 17:13.100]  the same time and collect their pollen for future use with the paintbrush?
[17:13.100 --> 17:17.120]  Or does this technique affect germination rates at all?
[17:17.120 --> 17:21.500]  If so, do you like to dilute your pollen with toasted flour or something like this?
[17:21.500 --> 17:24.820]  Or is direct pollination always best?
[17:24.820 --> 17:26.740]  That is the first part of the question.
[17:26.740 --> 17:29.380]  Let me touch on that for a moment.
[17:29.380 --> 17:36.820]  I never have more than one male plant in flower at a time because I only want to gather pollen
[17:36.820 --> 17:43.620]  from one male plant so that I know my cross is from that specific male.
[17:43.620 --> 17:47.780]  So I would never have two different males going in my garden at the same time because
[17:47.780 --> 17:49.940]  pollen just flies around.
[17:49.940 --> 17:51.260]  Pollen is microscopic.
[17:51.260 --> 17:55.580]  Pollen from plant A and pollen from plant B are going to go every direction and end
[17:55.580 --> 18:01.060]  up on your female plant and you have no idea which pollen donor made those seeds.
[18:01.060 --> 18:04.020]  So I would never have multiple males going like that.
[18:04.020 --> 18:08.100]  Maybe do one male, collect the pollen, chop him down, then clean up.
[18:08.100 --> 18:12.020]  You have to spray and clean up all that pollen that may be in the room.
[18:12.020 --> 18:14.380]  Then do another male and gather that pollen.
[18:14.380 --> 18:20.380]  But I don't like to work with multiple males at one time because I do fear pollen contamination.
[18:20.380 --> 18:24.940]  Now if you do gather pollen from one plant and you find one solid female that you want
[18:24.940 --> 18:31.540]  to put that pollen onto, the paintbrush technique is very useful and it does not cause any problems
[18:31.540 --> 18:32.820]  with the seeds.
[18:32.820 --> 18:37.260]  You're putting pollen onto plants, they're receiving it, they will make seeds just like
[18:37.260 --> 18:38.980]  any other situation.
[18:38.980 --> 18:44.860]  Now I do not recommend pollinating that plant with more than one type of pollen from different
[18:44.860 --> 18:46.020]  pollen donors.
[18:46.020 --> 18:51.220]  Even if you're doing it carefully, you're still going to get cross contamination.
[18:51.220 --> 18:57.020]  I highly recommend that you only experiment with one male at a time.
[18:57.020 --> 19:01.020]  You may be saying, no way bro, I want to do four or five males at a time.
[19:01.020 --> 19:05.060]  It's your grow, it's your garden, it's your company, you do it your way.
[19:05.060 --> 19:06.500]  But I wouldn't suggest that.
[19:06.500 --> 19:08.380]  I wouldn't do that in my grow.
[19:08.380 --> 19:12.900]  And if you plan on releasing those seeds to anybody, that is almost an irresponsible move
[19:12.900 --> 19:14.100]  as a breeder.
[19:14.100 --> 19:17.340]  That is kind of fast tracking shit that is not doing it the right way.
[19:17.340 --> 19:20.740]  So please don't do that to your consumers, to your customers.
[19:20.740 --> 19:21.740]  They don't want that.
[19:21.740 --> 19:25.260]  They want something reliable from one solid male.
[19:25.260 --> 19:28.620]  What if you cross the pollen up and you're not sure which pollen made those seeds and
[19:28.620 --> 19:30.900]  somebody gets the most amazing offspring?
[19:30.900 --> 19:34.640]  Do you know which male made that so you can reproduce that phenotype?
[19:34.640 --> 19:38.740]  You probably don't because there were multiple males and you had leaked pollen.
[19:38.740 --> 19:40.500]  So who is that baby daddy?
[19:40.500 --> 19:41.820]  We will never know.
[19:41.820 --> 19:43.500]  There is more to this part of the question.
[19:43.500 --> 19:49.340]  It says, do you like to dilute your pollen with toasted flour or something like that?
[19:49.340 --> 19:51.740]  No, I don't do anything like that.
[19:51.740 --> 19:57.260]  In most cases, I am pollinating with a male plant or with the reversed plant and I don't
[19:57.260 --> 19:58.700]  have saved pollen.
[19:58.700 --> 20:01.900]  I've got the actual pollen donor plant in the room.
[20:01.900 --> 20:06.540]  I let it flower out until it is dumping pollen and then I move it over by the girls and I
[20:06.540 --> 20:09.660]  just give it a couple of good flicks and that's all it really takes.
[20:09.660 --> 20:10.660]  You just flick it.
[20:10.660 --> 20:14.380]  You flick the stem and that vibrates it enough to make enough pollen go flying and then the
[20:14.380 --> 20:18.220]  fans and all the movement in the room just pollinate naturally.
[20:18.220 --> 20:22.660]  If I do have a reversed plant, after that flick, I will cut off a couple of the tops
[20:22.660 --> 20:26.580]  and I smack them on the walls and I smack them against the fan just to knock that last
[20:26.580 --> 20:30.660]  bit of pollen out of there because the reversed plants do not make near as much pollen as
[20:30.660 --> 20:32.220]  a standard male.
[20:32.220 --> 20:34.220]  But generally I do not save pollen.
[20:34.220 --> 20:40.340]  I do have a little bit of emergency pollen saved, but that is not how I generally make
[20:40.340 --> 20:41.340]  seeds.
[20:41.340 --> 20:45.500]  And the pollen that I do have saved, no, I do not cut it with any sort of cornstarch
[20:45.740 --> 20:48.780]  or what did you say, toasted something, toasted flour.
[20:48.780 --> 20:50.780]  No, I don't do anything like that.
[20:50.780 --> 20:52.580]  I dry the pollen completely.
[20:52.580 --> 20:54.340]  I remove all of the male flowers.
[20:54.340 --> 20:55.980]  I make sure it is crispy dry.
[20:55.980 --> 20:57.100]  I put it in a vial.
[20:57.100 --> 20:58.100]  I seal it.
[20:58.100 --> 21:04.320]  I've got a jar of vials in a paper bag in the bottom drawer of the refrigerator.
[21:04.320 --> 21:07.020]  That's where my emergency pollen is stashed.
[21:07.020 --> 21:08.500]  So there is more to this message.
[21:08.500 --> 21:13.340]  It says, you also mentioned increasing the white cycle after pollination for fatter,
[21:13.340 --> 21:14.820]  plumper seeds.
[21:14.820 --> 21:17.440]  What cycle do you run for pollinated plants?
[21:17.440 --> 21:23.860]  Could they finish well in a bedroom with less intense light or will that affect seed quality?
[21:23.860 --> 21:24.860]  That is accurate.
[21:24.860 --> 21:30.300]  I do run a non-conventional light schedule once my plants are pollinated.
[21:30.300 --> 21:35.040]  My goal is to get as much light energy to those plants as they can receive because my
[21:35.040 --> 21:38.540]  goal is no longer to create big, fat, chunky buds.
[21:38.540 --> 21:43.780]  My new goal has become to make big, fat, healthy, chunky seeds.
[21:43.780 --> 21:50.220]  So I'm able to change my timer to a longer daytime cycle that does disrupt the flowering
[21:50.220 --> 21:51.220]  cycle.
[21:51.220 --> 21:53.340]  After a few weeks, you will see the plants start to revert.
[21:53.340 --> 21:54.740]  They'll try to go back into veg.
[21:54.740 --> 21:56.280]  They'll start acting weird.
[21:56.280 --> 21:57.780]  But I'm not growing for buds.
[21:57.780 --> 21:59.420]  I'm growing for seeds.
[21:59.420 --> 22:05.180]  That makes super healthy, super happy seed because they're getting more light energy.
[22:05.180 --> 22:09.980]  It also makes them finish a little bit early so I'm able to harvest for those seeds a little
[22:09.980 --> 22:11.260]  bit earlier.
[22:11.260 --> 22:16.340]  So your main question on this was, can you move those seeded plants back into a bedroom
[22:16.340 --> 22:21.540]  with less light and flower those plants in the bedroom, probably so that you can utilize
[22:21.540 --> 22:25.100]  the flower room for some seedless plants is what I would imagine.
[22:25.100 --> 22:30.880]  But yes, you are able to move those plants into the bedroom if you have got enough light.
[22:30.880 --> 22:36.340]  If those plants are going to receive enough light from being under an extended light cycle
[22:36.340 --> 22:40.660]  as compared to being under a short cycle under larger lights, you can do that.
[22:40.660 --> 22:46.700]  But don't move them if they are going to get less U moles per day in their new environment.
[22:46.700 --> 22:50.900]  So just because they are getting longer light cycles doesn't mean they are getting more
[22:50.900 --> 22:54.860]  light if the light in the other room was twice as strong.
[22:54.860 --> 23:00.900]  I would only suggest changing the light to a longer day cycle if you are able to give
[23:00.900 --> 23:06.380]  them more overall lumens than the previous light condition.
[23:06.380 --> 23:09.940]  Now there is more to this email so I need to keep moving quickly because this episode
[23:09.940 --> 23:11.260]  is getting long.
[23:11.260 --> 23:18.720]  The next part says, also do you find many F1 or polyhybrids show more intersex traits?
[23:18.720 --> 23:23.740]  And by working them down filial generations, is that a trait that can be worked out?
[23:23.740 --> 23:28.860]  Or if there is any intersex traits in an F1 batch, do you scrap it?
[23:28.860 --> 23:35.400]  So they are asking if in an F1 or a polyhybrid batch, do I find more intersex traits?
[23:35.400 --> 23:39.780]  More intersex traits than an F2 or an F3 or an IBL?
[23:39.780 --> 23:40.780]  No.
[23:40.780 --> 23:46.140]  The only time I find intersex traits are if the plants were bred from plants which carried
[23:46.140 --> 23:48.460]  intersex traits themselves.
[23:48.460 --> 23:53.740]  I don't find that polyhybrids or F1s are more prone to hermaphroditism or intersex traits
[23:53.740 --> 23:54.740]  at all.
[23:54.740 --> 23:56.780]  That is not something I find to be common.
[23:56.780 --> 24:03.180]  I think any generation could be a hermaphrodite if the parents were hermaphrodites.
[24:03.180 --> 24:04.540]  So there is more to touch on this one.
[24:04.540 --> 24:09.340]  It says, by working them down filial generations, is that a trait that can be worked out?
[24:09.900 --> 24:10.900]  Yes.
[24:10.900 --> 24:15.620]  Intersex traits, hermaphroditism can be bred out over generations.
[24:15.620 --> 24:18.700]  But why would you even want to waste your time doing that?
[24:18.700 --> 24:23.680]  If you've got 10 plants and two of them are hermaphrodites, why breed with a hermaphrodite
[24:23.680 --> 24:25.860]  when you've got eight other opportunities?
[24:25.860 --> 24:27.260]  You're already crippling yourself.
[24:27.260 --> 24:29.260]  You're slowing yourself down in the race.
[24:29.260 --> 24:30.260]  You're wasting time.
[24:30.260 --> 24:34.180]  Unless there's something really amazing in that hermaphroditic plant that you want to
[24:34.180 --> 24:36.220]  fix, it's not worth your time.
[24:36.220 --> 24:37.220]  Abandon that.
[24:37.220 --> 24:39.240]  Get rid of it and work on something.
[24:39.240 --> 24:40.800]  I've said it before plenty of times.
[24:40.800 --> 24:42.160]  Let's go right back to it.
[24:42.160 --> 24:43.960]  Set yourself up for success.
[24:43.960 --> 24:47.480]  Why are you going to hobble yourself at the beginning of the race when you can set yourself
[24:47.480 --> 24:49.180]  up for success?
[24:49.180 --> 24:53.600]  If you were in a cook-off and you were trying to please some of the best chefs on the planet,
[24:53.600 --> 24:57.040]  you wouldn't go to some fast food restaurant, get some shit and put it in a bag and set
[24:57.040 --> 24:59.320]  it in front of them and go, bon appetit.
[24:59.320 --> 25:03.660]  You would go to the finest store in your neighborhood and get the finest ingredients and you would
[25:03.660 --> 25:05.600]  make the best shit you can give them.
[25:05.960 --> 25:10.000]  When they eat it, you would have confidence because you knew that you used solid ingredients
[25:10.000 --> 25:14.640]  and solid methods and solid techniques and you've created a product that is satisfactory
[25:14.640 --> 25:16.520]  that everybody will enjoy.
[25:16.520 --> 25:20.840]  If you go to four fast food restaurants and get a burger from one place, a taco from another
[25:20.840 --> 25:25.080]  and a milkshake from another and put it on a plate and make it look nice, nobody's going
[25:25.080 --> 25:26.320]  to be impressed.
[25:26.320 --> 25:29.040]  That's what's going to happen if you breed with hermaphrodite seeds.
[25:29.040 --> 25:32.200]  You're going to serve somebody a big plate full of bullshit and they're all going to
[25:32.200 --> 25:33.200]  hate you.
[25:33.200 --> 25:35.440]  Fuck, I think I'm hungry or something after that one.
[25:35.880 --> 25:37.560]  There is one more part to that part.
[25:37.560 --> 25:43.320]  It says, or would you just scrap that if there are any intersex traits in the F1 batch?
[25:43.320 --> 25:48.160]  Yes, if a new polyhybrid or an F1 showed intersex traits, it goes bye-bye.
[25:48.160 --> 25:49.160]  I scrap it.
[25:49.160 --> 25:51.760]  There is no need to continue that project.
[25:51.760 --> 25:56.720]  But I avoid that by testing my parent plants before I breed with them.
[25:56.720 --> 25:59.280]  Of course, there is no way to test a male plant.
[25:59.280 --> 26:03.080]  The only way to test them is to pollinate and then run those seeds.
[26:03.120 --> 26:09.240]  But I test my females very rigorously, very vigorously, very aggressively before I do
[26:09.240 --> 26:10.240]  breed with them.
[26:10.240 --> 26:12.440]  How do I test a female before you breed with it?
[26:12.440 --> 26:15.200]  You want to make sure that that female is not a hermaphrodite.
[26:15.200 --> 26:20.000]  You want to make sure that that female doesn't get powdery mildew and bud rot very easily.
[26:20.000 --> 26:23.840]  It's nice if your females that you use aren't prone to getting pests.
[26:23.840 --> 26:27.520]  There are some strains that if you put them in a commercial environment, the plants right
[26:27.520 --> 26:31.720]  next to them will get spider mites and some plants, the bugs just don't crawl on.
[26:31.760 --> 26:33.760]  So how do I test my females?
[26:33.760 --> 26:38.440]  I will get the females I intend to breed with and I'll put them in a small grow environment.
[26:38.440 --> 26:39.960]  I'll put them in flower.
[26:39.960 --> 26:44.040]  And about two weeks into the flowering process, I'll mess up the light cycle.
[26:44.040 --> 26:46.360]  I'll put it on 18-6 again.
[26:46.360 --> 26:48.720]  And now they're going, hey, we were in flower for a minute.
[26:48.720 --> 26:49.720]  Now we're back in veg.
[26:49.720 --> 26:50.960]  I don't know what to do.
[26:50.960 --> 26:54.200]  And then a couple of days later, I'll turn it off for two full days.
[26:54.200 --> 26:55.420]  Now they're in the dark.
[26:55.420 --> 26:57.680]  Now they don't know what the fuck is going on.
[26:57.680 --> 27:02.320]  Now after two days, let's put it back on 12-12 and watch those plants.
[27:02.320 --> 27:06.040]  Some plants will hermaphrodite and show stress problems.
[27:06.040 --> 27:09.560]  Those plants get pulled from my garden and do not get bred with.
[27:09.560 --> 27:14.220]  The plants that go through that process and come out looking happy and healthy, those
[27:14.220 --> 27:15.400]  are breeding plants.
[27:15.400 --> 27:19.080]  Those plants I am confident in putting tested pollen on.
[27:19.080 --> 27:22.080]  And I know that I'm going to make winter plants out of those.
[27:22.480 --> 27:27.680]  No matter what your specific goal is in a breeding project, the main goal is to improve
[27:27.680 --> 27:30.720]  upon the two lines you are working with.
[27:30.720 --> 27:35.020]  If you cross two things together and it comes out worse, why keep going?
[27:35.020 --> 27:40.960]  So if I see any intersex traits in an F1 or an F2, I will scrap the project at that point.
[27:40.960 --> 27:42.720]  There is no need for me to keep going.
[27:42.720 --> 27:45.520]  All right, I feel like I've ranted enough on that part.
[27:45.520 --> 27:46.520]  Let's see what else we've got.
[27:46.520 --> 27:51.400]  I recently ran a direct pollination with one male and a few select females.
[27:51.400 --> 27:56.640]  I introduced the male a week after the females, as I've heard suggested before.
[27:56.640 --> 28:02.520]  I removed the male after day 28 for the females, and the seeds never seemed to ripen, even
[28:02.520 --> 28:04.800]  with three extra weeks of flowering.
[28:04.800 --> 28:09.160]  I got some seeds from it, but the buds are garbage also.
[28:09.160 --> 28:12.000]  Man, sometimes breeding can be frustrating.
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.160]  I'm not sure where you went wrong with this cross.
[28:14.160 --> 28:16.840]  It sounds like you timed it semi-correctly.
[28:16.840 --> 28:20.580]  It takes a few tries with breeding to time things up because you don't know when that
[28:20.580 --> 28:23.820]  female is going to want pollen best, and you don't know when that male is going to
[28:23.820 --> 28:24.980]  drop pollen.
[28:24.980 --> 28:26.380]  So it's kind of a matchmaking move.
[28:26.380 --> 28:27.880]  You just got to time them.
[28:27.880 --> 28:29.380]  That's always a struggle.
[28:29.380 --> 28:33.860]  And then once pollination happens, you do have to feed the plants a little bit differently
[28:33.860 --> 28:36.020]  for quality seed production.
[28:36.020 --> 28:38.560]  So maybe they just didn't get the feed that they needed.
[28:38.560 --> 28:39.940]  Maybe they didn't get enough light.
[28:39.940 --> 28:41.100]  I'm not sure what happened.
[28:41.100 --> 28:42.340]  I'm not there in your grow.
[28:42.340 --> 28:43.900]  I can't see your environment.
[28:43.900 --> 28:48.500]  So I don't know why those seeds didn't work, but sometimes that's how breeding goes, and
[28:48.500 --> 28:49.640]  that sounds very frustrating.
[28:49.640 --> 28:52.120]  It sounds like you've got a lot of reading to do.
[28:52.120 --> 28:56.880]  I would definitely recommend reading The Breeder's Bible from Greg Green.
[28:56.880 --> 29:01.320]  I think that book would really give you a head start and help you figure out some of
[29:01.320 --> 29:03.360]  the minor details you might be missing.
[29:03.360 --> 29:05.060]  Now, there's one more quick paragraph.
[29:05.060 --> 29:10.120]  It says, in closing, any more detailed information on your process and what works and doesn't
[29:10.120 --> 29:12.320]  work for you would be appreciated.
[29:12.320 --> 29:16.800]  I want to make fatter, darker seeds with better germination rates.
[29:16.800 --> 29:21.900]  Like I said before, bro, I think read a couple of quality breeding books, and those will
[29:21.900 --> 29:25.760]  get you over some of the very minor details that you are missing.
[29:25.760 --> 29:29.880]  There is a lot of stuff to learn when it comes to breeding, and I can teach you a lot, but
[29:29.880 --> 29:34.420]  I think reading a book will give you the foundation that you need.
[29:34.420 --> 29:37.400]  They wrap up the message with, thank you for taking the time to read this.
[29:37.400 --> 29:38.720]  I hope to hear from you.
[29:38.720 --> 29:42.160]  Signed, Super Kev from Garden City Genetics.
[29:42.160 --> 29:44.720]  Hey, Super Kev, thank you for the great email.
[29:44.720 --> 29:48.120]  I hope I have taught you something in all of my ramblings.
[29:48.120 --> 29:53.360]  Good luck in your next breeding project, and extra good luck with your genetics company.
[29:53.360 --> 29:57.760]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes, smokers
[29:57.760 --> 30:03.960]  and growers, seed growers, seed hoarders, clone cutters, fucking plant killers, I love
[30:03.960 --> 30:04.960]  you all.
[30:04.960 --> 30:06.480]  I want to thank you guys for listening to this episode.
[30:06.480 --> 30:11.280]  It is time to wrap it up because my voice is starting to sound like a shit.
[30:11.280 --> 30:13.000]  So let's wrap up this episode.
[30:13.000 --> 30:16.680]  The next episode will be the Indo Expo recap.
[30:16.680 --> 30:19.860]  While you're listening to that episode, I will be chilling out, resting my voice and
[30:19.860 --> 30:23.120]  recovering from the Indo Expo weekend.
[30:23.120 --> 30:27.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you feel like this episode was educational, informative, or entertaining,

[30:55.200 --> 31:00.520]  Recently, the Iry Genetics Instagram was suspended for about a day.
[31:00.520 --> 31:03.360]  My main Instagram is Iry underscore genetics.
[31:03.360 --> 31:04.900]  That's my seed company.
[31:04.900 --> 31:06.960]  That account was suspended for about a day.
[31:06.960 --> 31:08.400]  I did get it back.
[31:08.400 --> 31:13.680]  If you follow Iry Genetics and you can't find me, it's because somewhere in the settings,
[31:13.680 --> 31:18.840]  they have made it to where my page, you've got to be 21 or over to view my page.
[31:18.840 --> 31:21.440]  Somewhere in your settings, you've got to tell them you're 21.
[31:21.440 --> 31:24.680]  Then it will give you access back to my Instagram page.
[31:24.680 --> 31:26.040]  The page is not gone.
[31:26.040 --> 31:27.040]  It's just hidden.
[31:27.040 --> 31:28.160]  It is restricted.
[31:28.160 --> 31:29.880]  You've got to be old enough to see it.
[31:29.880 --> 31:36.420]  To prevent any confusion from the Iry Genetics Instagram in the future, I recommend you guys
[31:36.420 --> 31:40.060]  follow the Grow From Your Heart podcast Instagram.
[31:40.060 --> 31:41.060]  That's right.
[31:41.060 --> 31:44.020]  I've been updating that Instagram a little bit more frequently, trying to be more active
[31:44.020 --> 31:45.060]  over there.
[31:45.060 --> 31:49.300]  Come hang out with me on the Grow From Your Heart podcast Instagram page.

[31:56.580 --> 32:00.860]  or a cannabis cultivation question, or maybe you're just not into all that social media
[32:00.860 --> 32:02.900]  nonsense, you can send me an email.

[32:11.400 --> 32:13.480]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[32:13.480 --> 32:16.520]  I want to give a giant shout out to Jesse James.
[32:16.520 --> 32:19.640]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
