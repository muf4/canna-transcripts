[03:01.560 --> 03:04.760]  Yo Rasta Jeff put that link in the show notes while you're editing.
[03:04.760 --> 03:06.600]  All right where do we go from here?
[03:06.800 --> 03:09.000]  Ladies and gentlemen let's jump into today's topic.
[03:09.000 --> 03:11.680]  It is a beautiful day here in Southern Colorado.
[03:11.680 --> 03:14.280]  It was the first super nice day of the year.
[03:14.280 --> 03:15.280]  It's been really cold.
[03:15.280 --> 03:20.460]  It's been a jacket and gloves kind of season at least a heavy hoodie season.
[03:20.460 --> 03:22.760]  Today I did not need a hoodie when I went out of the house.
[03:22.760 --> 03:23.760]  It was super nice.
[03:23.760 --> 03:24.960]  It was super beautiful.
[03:24.960 --> 03:27.440]  That means outdoor season is almost coming.
[03:27.440 --> 03:29.880]  Before we get to that also it was my birthday today.
[03:29.880 --> 03:34.120]  So I want to give a big shout out to all of my friends who sent me birthday love, birthday
[03:34.120 --> 03:35.120]  messages.
[03:35.120 --> 03:36.520]  I'm not doing the podcast on my birthday.
[03:36.520 --> 03:37.840]  Big exciting Tuesday here.
[03:37.840 --> 03:40.640]  But we did have a great birthday weekend.
[03:40.640 --> 03:43.360]  I got to spend my birthday weekend with some wonderful people.
[03:43.360 --> 03:46.440]  I got to meet for the very first time in person.
[03:46.440 --> 03:50.240]  I got to hug and high five and smoke with our buddy Lemur Priest.
[03:50.240 --> 03:54.200]  Big shout out to Lemur Priest the captain and commander of the Irie Army.
[03:54.200 --> 03:56.000]  He's been part of the crew for a long time.
[03:56.000 --> 03:58.280]  He's a heavy contributor to the Patreon.
[03:58.280 --> 04:00.680]  He's a bad motherfucker, a cool dude.
[04:00.680 --> 04:01.680]  We hung out.
[04:01.680 --> 04:03.040]  We visited Meow Wolf.
[04:03.040 --> 04:04.640]  He brought his lovely partner in crime.
[04:04.680 --> 04:06.720]  I brought my lovely partner in crime.
[04:06.720 --> 04:08.840]  Also we were joined by the awesome Curtis Crosses.
[04:08.840 --> 04:09.840]  Big up to Curtis.
[04:09.840 --> 04:11.760]  Also big shout out to my new friend Lennon.
[04:11.760 --> 04:13.040]  We had a great time at Meow Wolf.
[04:13.040 --> 04:15.120]  So I had a wonderful birthday weekend.
[04:15.120 --> 04:16.120]  The whole weekend was great.
[04:16.120 --> 04:17.120]  We'll talk about Meow Wolf.
[04:17.120 --> 04:18.560]  That's what we did Friday.
[04:18.560 --> 04:20.360]  Saturday spent some time with some other people.
[04:20.360 --> 04:22.720]  Sunday was just me and my lovely queen.
[04:22.720 --> 04:23.720]  Great birthday weekend.
[04:23.720 --> 04:26.920]  Wanted to say thanks to everybody for the birthday love, the hugs, the shout outs, the
[04:26.920 --> 04:30.640]  fist bumps, the high fives, the gifts, all the social media explosion.
[04:30.640 --> 04:31.640]  Thank you.
[04:31.640 --> 04:32.640]  I do appreciate that.
[04:32.640 --> 04:36.480]  Big thanks to anybody who spent any moment with me on my birthday weekend, on my birthday
[04:36.480 --> 04:38.040]  this week, whenever.
[04:38.040 --> 04:39.520]  It's been a great time.
[04:39.520 --> 04:40.520]  Big thanks.
[04:40.520 --> 04:41.520]  I do appreciate it.
[04:41.520 --> 04:44.040]  Thanks for taking a moment out of your day just to spend some birthday love on me.
[04:44.040 --> 04:45.040]  I do appreciate that.
[04:45.040 --> 04:47.600]  All right, let's move forward enough talking about my birthday.
[04:47.600 --> 04:50.200]  I said I was going to talk about outdoor growing.
[04:50.200 --> 04:52.680]  It is the nicest, the first nice day of the year.
[04:52.680 --> 04:55.400]  It made me think I better get my shit prepared for the outdoor season.
[04:55.400 --> 04:57.280]  Yes, I may do some outdoor stuff this year.
[04:57.280 --> 04:59.920]  I don't talk about it because I don't like too many people knowing.
[04:59.920 --> 05:02.680]  You don't need to know what or where I'm doing outdoors because that gives people too
[05:02.680 --> 05:03.680]  many opportunities.
[05:03.680 --> 05:05.400]  Too many people out there suck.
[05:05.400 --> 05:08.280]  So I've got to keep that a little bit on the down low until it's done and then I'll tell
[05:08.280 --> 05:09.280]  you all about it.
[05:09.280 --> 05:11.240]  But it is time for everybody out there.
[05:11.240 --> 05:14.960]  If you're going to grow outdoors in North America, I guess if you're in other parts
[05:14.960 --> 05:17.400]  of the world, you may be wrapping up outdoors right now.
[05:17.400 --> 05:18.400]  Maybe done.
[05:18.400 --> 05:21.840]  I don't know where you are, but in North America here it is outdoor time.
[05:21.840 --> 05:23.240]  It's time to get the outdoor season plan.
[05:23.240 --> 05:24.400]  It is the first of March.
[05:24.400 --> 05:28.520]  We're going to put our plants out there probably mid May, early June, depending on where you
[05:28.520 --> 05:29.520]  are.
[05:30.120 --> 05:31.120]  So start thinking about it.
[05:31.120 --> 05:34.440]  If you don't have seeds or clones or some sort of supply, now is the time to get on
[05:34.440 --> 05:35.440]  the hunt.
[05:35.440 --> 05:37.920]  Start searching, start thinking about it, start figuring it out.
[05:37.920 --> 05:42.320]  But there are many things to think about before we decide what plants to put outside, how
[05:42.320 --> 05:44.120]  to get them, where to get them from.
[05:44.120 --> 05:45.920]  Let's think about it.
[05:45.920 --> 05:46.920]  Selections.
[05:46.920 --> 05:49.680]  The first thing on my note here is selections.
[05:49.680 --> 05:51.640]  What does good in your area?
[05:51.640 --> 05:53.240]  Let's find a selection for you.
[05:53.240 --> 05:58.800]  A plant, a clone, a cultivar, the line, the kind of the strain is what a lot of people
[05:58.800 --> 05:59.800]  are going to say.
[05:59.800 --> 06:03.600]  The strain that will work best for you in your area.
[06:03.600 --> 06:06.520]  Many people are going to try to focus on hype.
[06:06.520 --> 06:08.040]  Right now there are strains that are popular.
[06:08.040 --> 06:11.280]  I'm not going to say any because then the breeder of that strain will get back to me
[06:11.280 --> 06:13.320]  and say, Hey, you said my strain was hype.
[06:13.320 --> 06:16.760]  There are a lot of things that are just popular because of social media and because of the
[06:16.760 --> 06:19.920]  name and maybe a rapper saying about it or some shit.
[06:19.920 --> 06:21.480]  It's not super quality.
[06:21.480 --> 06:22.640]  It looks good on Instagram.
[06:22.640 --> 06:23.640]  It's frosty.
[06:23.640 --> 06:25.920]  It looks nice, but it doesn't have a mold resistance.
[06:25.920 --> 06:27.840]  It doesn't have bug resistance.
[06:27.880 --> 06:33.080]  Think about more important things other than hype, turps, potency and yield.
[06:33.080 --> 06:35.060]  Does that plant work in your environment?
[06:35.060 --> 06:38.520]  If it doesn't finish on time where you are, the turps don't matter.
[06:38.520 --> 06:39.600]  The potency doesn't matter.
[06:39.600 --> 06:40.940]  The yield doesn't matter.
[06:40.940 --> 06:45.400]  If it's not done before the first frost comes in your area, it doesn't matter how good that
[06:45.400 --> 06:46.760]  plant was going to be.
[06:46.760 --> 06:48.360]  It's got to get finished.
[06:48.360 --> 06:52.640]  If your plant can't handle heat or fog or drought or humidity or whatever it comes to
[06:52.640 --> 06:56.600]  your neighborhood, your environment throughout that growth season, it won't be able to survive
[06:56.600 --> 06:57.760]  until the harvest.
[06:57.880 --> 07:03.160]  Don't focus strictly on terpenes, production, flavor, buzz, weights.
[07:03.160 --> 07:04.760]  Don't think about that kind of stuff as much.
[07:04.760 --> 07:05.760]  It's important.
[07:05.760 --> 07:06.920]  Trust me, that does matter.
[07:06.920 --> 07:11.080]  But more importantly, the resistance, the ability, the skills of that plant.
[07:11.080 --> 07:12.540]  Can it survive where you are?
[07:12.540 --> 07:15.840]  That's much more important than a lot of those other things.
[07:15.840 --> 07:18.400]  Can that plant take the ... I'm not sure where you are.
[07:18.400 --> 07:20.440]  That's why I said maybe it's going to get drought conditions.
[07:20.440 --> 07:24.000]  If you're in Arizona, it's going to get hot as fuck and really dry.
[07:24.000 --> 07:25.560]  If you're by the ocean, you're going to get humidity.
[07:25.560 --> 07:28.480]  You're going to get air coming off of the ocean with a lot of water in it.
[07:28.480 --> 07:29.920]  You're going to get windy environment.
[07:29.920 --> 07:31.000]  You're going to get fog.
[07:31.000 --> 07:32.680]  Can your plants handle the fog?
[07:32.680 --> 07:35.080]  If you're up in the Pacific Northwest, you're going to get different shit.
[07:35.080 --> 07:36.880]  If you're in Colorado, different shit.
[07:36.880 --> 07:38.040]  Mississippi, different shit.
[07:38.040 --> 07:39.480]  It's going to be different wherever you are.
[07:39.480 --> 07:43.800]  So get plants that will work best for you in your environment.
[07:43.800 --> 07:45.880]  Then think about where are we going to grow?
[07:45.880 --> 07:47.280]  Where is your anticipated space?
[07:47.280 --> 07:49.040]  And think about it heavily.
[07:49.040 --> 07:51.240]  You're going to have those plants out there for months.
[07:51.240 --> 07:53.600]  It's not just going to be a couple of weeks to camouflage them.
[07:53.600 --> 07:57.880]  You're going to be out there daily taking care of them, tending them, watering them.
[07:57.880 --> 08:02.120]  You've got to feed them, prune them, twist them, lollipop them, check on them, manage
[08:02.120 --> 08:03.800]  bugs, manage problems.
[08:03.800 --> 08:05.320]  You're going to be touching them every single day.
[08:05.320 --> 08:09.600]  It's not as easy to be secretive about these plants as a lot of people would like to think.
[08:09.600 --> 08:10.920]  Where are you going to do this?
[08:10.920 --> 08:11.920]  Are you going to do it in the backyard?
[08:11.920 --> 08:13.440]  Are you going to do it in the front yard?
[08:13.440 --> 08:14.840]  Are you going to do it on the side of the house?
[08:14.840 --> 08:16.880]  Do you have a big ass field?
[08:16.880 --> 08:17.880]  Where are you going to do it?
[08:17.880 --> 08:19.800]  Do you have a big field way out in the middle of nowhere?
[08:19.800 --> 08:21.160]  Where do you plan on doing this?
[08:21.160 --> 08:23.120]  Think this through very well.
[08:23.120 --> 08:26.480]  Think about from the day you plant it to the day you cut it down to the day you dry it,
[08:26.480 --> 08:27.480]  cure it, and smoke it.
[08:27.480 --> 08:29.440]  What are you going to do with this plant and the product?
[08:29.440 --> 08:30.960]  Have a plan now.
[08:30.960 --> 08:33.040]  Let's set ourselves up for success.
[08:33.040 --> 08:36.240]  We're going to harvest around Halloween and we need to start thinking about it now in
[08:36.240 --> 08:37.240]  March.
[08:37.240 --> 08:39.200]  I know that sounds crazy, but plan ahead.
[08:39.200 --> 08:41.760]  That's the only way we win when we're growing cannabis.
[08:41.760 --> 08:43.960]  Don't come to the part where you're like, it's day 50.
[08:43.960 --> 08:45.000]  What do I do on day 50?
[08:45.000 --> 08:48.600]  You should know that around day 30 so you can prepare, at least be ahead.
[08:48.600 --> 08:49.600]  All right.
[08:49.600 --> 08:50.600]  Where are we going to grow?
[08:50.600 --> 08:53.600]  Is your anticipated grow space get enough sun?
[08:53.600 --> 08:54.720]  You get enough direct sun.
[08:54.720 --> 08:56.640]  Are there a slight interruptions?
[08:56.640 --> 08:57.800]  Are there dark interruptions?
[08:57.800 --> 09:00.400]  Is there a lot of shit around there that is going to come on?
[09:00.400 --> 09:03.680]  Lights that are going to come on during the night cycle and possibly disrupt your photo
[09:03.680 --> 09:04.680]  period.
[09:04.680 --> 09:06.320]  Is there a lot of shit blocking the sun?
[09:06.320 --> 09:07.940]  Is there a lot of wind there?
[09:07.940 --> 09:09.240]  What kind of environment are you in?
[09:09.240 --> 09:10.240]  Are there animals?
[09:10.240 --> 09:11.240]  Are there pests?
[09:11.240 --> 09:12.240]  Are there intruders?
[09:12.240 --> 09:13.400]  What kind of ground do you have there?
[09:13.400 --> 09:14.400]  Are you going to grow in beds?
[09:14.400 --> 09:15.400]  Are you going to grow in pots?
[09:15.400 --> 09:16.640]  Are you going to go straight in the ground?
[09:16.640 --> 09:18.440]  Are you going to build a greenhouse?
[09:18.440 --> 09:22.200]  What kind of obstacles and challenges is your anticipated grow environment going to
[09:22.200 --> 09:23.520]  bring you?
[09:23.520 --> 09:25.960]  Do you have regular access to this place?
[09:25.960 --> 09:29.320]  A lot of people think there's a hill, a mountain that goes this way.
[09:29.320 --> 09:32.840]  If you take that one hill by the creek and take a left, nobody will ever find that spot.
[09:32.840 --> 09:33.840]  Sure.
[09:33.840 --> 09:34.840]  Awesome.
[09:34.840 --> 09:37.080]  Can you get there every single day to apply water to those plants?
[09:37.080 --> 09:38.600]  Is that going to be safe?
[09:38.600 --> 09:40.160]  Also is that a safe place for you to grow?
[09:40.160 --> 09:41.600]  I think that's coming up on the notes.
[09:41.600 --> 09:42.600]  Let's think.
[09:42.600 --> 09:43.600]  Let's look ahead.
[09:43.600 --> 09:44.600]  Is that compliant and legal?
[09:44.600 --> 09:45.780]  We're just going to jump right into it.
[09:45.780 --> 09:48.360]  Is that location compliant and legal?
[09:48.400 --> 09:50.320]  I know some of us are going to do our own thing.
[09:50.320 --> 09:51.760]  We may grow where it's not legal.
[09:51.760 --> 09:55.140]  We may be in an illegal area, but be careful.
[09:55.140 --> 09:56.240]  Don't grow on federal land.
[09:56.240 --> 10:00.480]  If you're growing in a state park, federal land, land owned by a lawyer or somebody prominent
[10:00.480 --> 10:03.480]  in the community, you could really shoot yourself in the foot growing on that land.
[10:03.480 --> 10:06.240]  It could be even worse than just growing in your own land.
[10:06.240 --> 10:08.480]  So be careful where you choose to grow.
[10:08.480 --> 10:13.760]  In Colorado, an outdoor grow must be secured and locked up and inaccessible to thieves
[10:13.760 --> 10:15.940]  or children or anybody like that.
[10:15.940 --> 10:18.940]  It cannot be available to school kids or neighborhood kids.
[10:18.940 --> 10:22.340]  It's got to be in a greenhouse with a lock on it for nobody can get in there.
[10:22.340 --> 10:25.820]  That also does work, kind of helps to work as thief deterrent.
[10:25.820 --> 10:27.820]  It will not be the best way to keep a thief out.
[10:27.820 --> 10:29.840]  If the thieves want in there, they're going to get in there.
[10:29.840 --> 10:31.400]  That's something we're going to segue into.
[10:31.400 --> 10:33.900]  Before that, let's talk about a lawyer.
[10:33.900 --> 10:38.060]  If you're going to grow cannabis illegally or illegally, especially an outdoor crop where
[10:38.060 --> 10:40.020]  people can see it, things may go wrong.
[10:40.020 --> 10:43.780]  I highly recommend you develop a relationship with a lawyer.
[10:43.780 --> 10:45.400]  A lawyer will become your best friend.
[10:45.400 --> 10:50.040]  You don't want to ever need them, but it's great to have a lawyer on speed dial, a lawyer
[10:50.040 --> 10:53.640]  on the team, a lawyer in the crew that's already got a bag of money with your name on it.
[10:53.640 --> 10:55.640]  So every time you call, you go, lawyer, this is my problem.
[10:55.640 --> 10:56.640]  And they just reach into the bag.
[10:56.640 --> 11:00.040]  They take out a couple of the hundred dollar bills or a thousand or a couple thousand dollar
[11:00.040 --> 11:01.720]  bills and throw it in their stack.
[11:01.720 --> 11:03.480]  And they go, all right, here's how you solve the problem.
[11:03.480 --> 11:05.640]  And they just check out how much money they've taken out of your bag.
[11:05.640 --> 11:08.440]  And you both know, got a little bit of a balance with you over there.
[11:08.440 --> 11:09.960]  Whenever I call, there's money in your desk.
[11:09.960 --> 11:13.080]  So you're going to talk to me, get a relationship with a lawyer.
[11:13.080 --> 11:14.240]  This sounds crazy.
[11:14.240 --> 11:17.120]  Be a hundred percent honest with your lawyer about what you're doing.
[11:17.120 --> 11:21.520]  If you're growing illegally, tell that lawyer you're growing illegally and tell him where,
[11:21.520 --> 11:23.440]  why, how, and what your plan is.
[11:23.440 --> 11:26.760]  That way he can prepare for when shit goes wrong because there's a good chance shit could
[11:26.760 --> 11:27.760]  go wrong.
[11:27.760 --> 11:28.840]  That's why we've got a lawyer.
[11:28.840 --> 11:29.840]  Let him know what you're doing.
[11:29.840 --> 11:33.360]  That lawyer needs to know the details because if there's a case built against you, whoever's
[11:33.360 --> 11:36.240]  building that case has every fucking detail.
[11:36.240 --> 11:37.880]  It is 2022.
[11:37.880 --> 11:39.160]  They've got aerial photos.
[11:39.160 --> 11:41.120]  They've got documents from where your phone was.
[11:41.120 --> 11:43.880]  They've got everything you've posted on social media, all your credit card receipts, your
[11:43.880 --> 11:49.200]  car mileage, your GPS in your car, your OnStar, your anti-theft piece.
[11:49.200 --> 11:50.240]  Something is tracking you.
[11:50.240 --> 11:53.960]  You're being snitched on by yourself, by your equipment, by your technology, by your movement
[11:53.960 --> 11:55.380]  all day, every day.
[11:55.380 --> 11:58.720]  So if you're going to do something, they are building a case against you.
[11:58.720 --> 12:02.160]  Make sure your lawyer knows every detail of the case as well so that he can help you when
[12:02.160 --> 12:03.160]  the time comes.
[12:03.160 --> 12:07.360]  I know that sounds sketchy, but you've got to think about what if when you were entering
[12:07.360 --> 12:12.160]  this type of enterprise environment activity, you do need to be prepared.
[12:12.160 --> 12:13.160]  So shout out to the lawyers.
[12:13.440 --> 12:15.960]  Shout out to the people keeping us safe on the team behind the scenes.
[12:15.960 --> 12:21.120]  We need them just as much as we need the growers, the smokers, the breeders, the trimmers, everybody.
[12:21.120 --> 12:22.520]  The lawyers are essential.
[12:22.520 --> 12:23.520]  All right.
[12:23.520 --> 12:24.820]  We have talked about the lawyer.
[12:24.820 --> 12:29.040]  Now I'm going to segue into a part that I don't like talking about, but this is required
[12:29.040 --> 12:31.280]  when we're talking about growing outdoor cannabis.
[12:31.280 --> 12:34.840]  If you've got a big ass plant outdoors, somebody may have seen it.
[12:34.840 --> 12:36.560]  Maybe you ran your mouth and told somebody about it.
[12:36.560 --> 12:38.460]  Maybe the one person you told, told two people.
[12:38.460 --> 12:39.740]  They told two people.
[12:39.740 --> 12:41.640]  Now like 17 people in your neighborhood know.
[12:41.640 --> 12:43.480]  They all know you got that big plan out there.
[12:43.480 --> 12:45.560]  They all know your schedule because we're humans.
[12:45.560 --> 12:46.560]  We're predictable.
[12:46.560 --> 12:47.760]  We all do the same shit all the time.
[12:47.760 --> 12:49.960]  Mostly just because that's how life works.
[12:49.960 --> 12:51.900]  That plant is at risk.
[12:51.900 --> 12:56.240]  Somebody may decide to come try and remove that plant from your grow space without your
[12:56.240 --> 12:57.400]  permission.
[12:57.400 --> 12:58.400]  People are dickheads.
[12:58.400 --> 13:00.040]  People are desperate, especially now.
[13:00.040 --> 13:01.880]  We had a lot of things disrupt the world.
[13:01.880 --> 13:02.880]  People are struggling.
[13:02.880 --> 13:05.400]  People are doing dumb shit to try to stay afloat.
[13:05.400 --> 13:07.520]  Somebody may try to come get that plant.
[13:07.520 --> 13:12.040]  I don't know what you're going to do when somebody ends up in your yard trying to take
[13:12.040 --> 13:13.080]  that plant.
[13:13.080 --> 13:16.480]  If you were growing illegally, my advice is just let them take it.
[13:16.480 --> 13:19.800]  I don't think that anybody's life is worth a cannabis plant.
[13:19.800 --> 13:23.520]  If they're stealing my plant from my backyard, I am not going to shoot somebody for that
[13:23.520 --> 13:24.520]  plant.
[13:24.520 --> 13:27.320]  If that is what you choose to do, that is what you choose to do.
[13:27.320 --> 13:31.840]  But I want you right now to take a moment and think about what am I going to do if somebody
[13:31.840 --> 13:35.360]  comes in that yard to steal my ganja plant?
[13:35.360 --> 13:39.800]  Then once you've decided what you're going to do, think about would a jury agree with
[13:39.800 --> 13:41.200]  your decision.
[13:41.200 --> 13:45.880]  If you do choose to blast somebody down because they're stealing your ganja plant, a judge
[13:45.880 --> 13:51.320]  and a jury may think that you have decided that that person's life was worth less than
[13:51.320 --> 13:52.320]  your medicine.
[13:52.320 --> 13:56.440]  Now to you, it may be, but does the judge and the jury agree?
[13:56.440 --> 13:58.680]  I don't want it to ever come to that point.
[13:58.680 --> 13:59.980]  I really truly don't.
[13:59.980 --> 14:02.320]  But that is something we must think about.
[14:02.320 --> 14:04.080]  Somebody may try to steal your shit.
[14:04.120 --> 14:06.120]  How are you going to protect it?
[14:06.120 --> 14:07.720]  How are you going to deal with it?
[14:07.720 --> 14:11.260]  Then down the line, how are you going to deal with this for the next five years?
[14:11.260 --> 14:15.560]  If you protect your crop, this could be a legal case that could cause a lot of problems.
[14:15.560 --> 14:18.420]  So think about that before the plant goes outside.
[14:18.420 --> 14:19.640]  How am I going to deal with this?
[14:19.640 --> 14:21.960]  A lot of people in America are gun happy.
[14:21.960 --> 14:23.800]  We've all got a gun since the pandemic.
[14:23.800 --> 14:25.480]  Everybody's ready to protect themselves.
[14:25.480 --> 14:27.640]  Are you ready to bring that out and protect your crop?
[14:27.640 --> 14:28.760]  I don't recommend it.
[14:28.760 --> 14:31.040]  I wouldn't shoot somebody for weed plants in my backyard.
[14:31.040 --> 14:32.440]  If you went back there, I don't have weed plants.
[14:32.440 --> 14:33.440]  I live in the fucking city.
[14:33.480 --> 14:36.240]  My neighbors could just fucking reach over and take anything they wanted.
[14:36.240 --> 14:37.240]  Basically, they wouldn't.
[14:37.240 --> 14:38.240]  Shout out guys, I love you.
[14:38.240 --> 14:39.920]  But they would see the ganja plants, they'd throw a fucking fix.
[14:39.920 --> 14:42.840]  I live in the fucking city and shit here.
[14:42.840 --> 14:46.320]  If they were out there and you tried to steal them, I'd just say, hey man, don't fucking
[14:46.320 --> 14:47.320]  hurt the neighbors.
[14:47.320 --> 14:48.360]  Don't shoot any dogs.
[14:48.360 --> 14:49.360]  Don't fuck up the fence.
[14:49.360 --> 14:50.640]  Just get what you need and get out of here, bro.
[14:50.640 --> 14:51.640]  Just get the fuck out.
[14:51.640 --> 14:52.640]  Don't come back.
[14:52.640 --> 14:53.640]  That'd basically be my approach.
[14:53.640 --> 14:57.120]  That's why I don't grow outside because I'm in the city and somebody will steal my shit.
[14:57.120 --> 14:58.600]  You've got to think now what you might do.
[14:58.600 --> 15:00.800]  I don't want to go on too much about that.
[15:00.800 --> 15:03.320]  Let's move forward because I don't want to think about it.
[15:03.760 --> 15:05.080]  Is hitting somebody worth your crop?
[15:05.080 --> 15:06.480]  Is shooting somebody worth your crop?
[15:06.480 --> 15:10.000]  Or is, you've got to think about it now because I don't want you to be in that position and
[15:10.000 --> 15:11.360]  have to panic and think about it.
[15:11.360 --> 15:12.360]  Plan ahead.
[15:12.360 --> 15:15.480]  Any sort of thing when it comes to defense, tactical strategy, you should be thinking
[15:15.480 --> 15:16.480]  way ahead.
[15:16.480 --> 15:18.320]  So now let's talk about preparation.
[15:18.320 --> 15:23.080]  Let's talk about something a little bit more lighthearted, a little bit less creepy.
[15:23.080 --> 15:25.480]  Our whole goal is to grow weed outdoors this year.
[15:25.480 --> 15:26.920]  We want to produce an outdoor crop.
[15:26.920 --> 15:28.600]  We got free sunshine.
[15:28.600 --> 15:32.000]  We got an environment out there that is probably ideal for growing cannabis if you're in North
[15:32.000 --> 15:33.160]  America.
[15:34.000 --> 15:35.400]  So how are we going to prepare for this?
[15:35.400 --> 15:37.000]  What is your main strategy?
[15:37.000 --> 15:38.000]  How do you want to do this?
[15:38.000 --> 15:39.080]  Are you going to grow organically?
[15:39.080 --> 15:40.640]  Are you going to grow with salt?
[15:40.640 --> 15:43.240]  Are you going to grow, like I said before, are you going to grow in a greenhouse?
[15:43.240 --> 15:44.640]  Are you going to grow in raised beds?
[15:44.640 --> 15:45.640]  Are you going to use pots?
[15:45.640 --> 15:48.360]  Are you digging holes and going straight into the ground?
[15:48.360 --> 15:51.320]  Do you plan to amend the soil?
[15:51.320 --> 15:54.760]  Do you plan to just water every day and put bottled nutrients into there?
[15:54.760 --> 15:56.240]  What is your goal?
[15:56.240 --> 15:58.200]  The next thing to think about is water.
[15:58.200 --> 16:00.560]  How are you going to get water to your grow space?
[16:00.560 --> 16:03.120]  A lot of people may think they're going to grow out there on that plot of land.
[16:03.120 --> 16:05.040]  Their uncle left them a few years ago.
[16:05.040 --> 16:06.040]  How's the dirt out there?
[16:06.040 --> 16:07.520]  How is the soil out there?
[16:07.520 --> 16:09.560]  More importantly, is there access to water?
[16:09.560 --> 16:13.000]  Do you have a truck you can load up enough water to take out there as frequently as needed?
[16:13.000 --> 16:16.200]  Do you have a place you can get that much water out there?
[16:16.200 --> 16:19.820]  Water is a big thing to think about that people really overlook when it comes to preparing
[16:19.820 --> 16:21.240]  for an outdoor grow.
[16:21.240 --> 16:25.520]  It's one of the most essential things, but you don't realize how much water that plant
[16:25.520 --> 16:26.520]  is going to need.
[16:26.520 --> 16:28.360]  They're going to grow crazy fast outdoors.
[16:28.360 --> 16:30.440]  They're going to get real tall, real bushy.
[16:30.440 --> 16:32.240]  It's going to get 100 degrees out there.
[16:32.360 --> 16:34.720]  They're going to want to drink a lot of water.
[16:34.720 --> 16:38.760]  Depending on where you are, if the earth is real rocky, if it's real damp, they may need
[16:38.760 --> 16:41.760]  more, they may need less water, but they're going to get thirsty.
[16:41.760 --> 16:45.120]  Now a big thing to think about, and maybe I should have talked about this earlier, but
[16:45.120 --> 16:46.640]  what is your budget?
[16:46.640 --> 16:47.640]  What kind of budget do you have?
[16:47.640 --> 16:51.920]  Do you have a budget to buy a bunch of nutrients to amend the soil?
[16:51.920 --> 16:53.760]  Do you have a budget for really good genetics?
[16:53.760 --> 16:57.960]  Do you have a budget for all of the stuff you need or you want a shoestring budget?
[16:57.960 --> 16:59.520]  Use your budget wisely.
[16:59.520 --> 17:01.160]  I recommend good genetics.
[17:01.160 --> 17:04.920]  If you don't have good genetics to start with, you cannot meet the goals you are hoping
[17:04.920 --> 17:05.920]  for.
[17:05.920 --> 17:06.920]  So start with good genetics.
[17:06.920 --> 17:08.840]  Like I said, the correct genetics in your environment.
[17:08.840 --> 17:13.240]  So you need good genes, whether that's clones or seeds, you need good genetics.
[17:13.240 --> 17:15.720]  We're going to talk a lot more about that in a moment.
[17:15.720 --> 17:17.800]  Then I would recommend getting that soil amended well.
[17:17.800 --> 17:20.040]  So you've got all of the things you need in the soil.
[17:20.040 --> 17:24.720]  I'd recommend investing in a couple of top dresses for later on in the flowering phase.
[17:24.720 --> 17:29.920]  Make sure you allocate a little bit of that budget for pest management and pest deterrent.
[17:29.920 --> 17:33.880]  Maybe you've got deer or bunny or bear or fucking something else wherever you are.
[17:33.880 --> 17:35.300]  I don't know where you are.
[17:35.300 --> 17:39.180]  You're going to have to allocate part of the budget to mitigating damage from pests.
[17:39.180 --> 17:40.400]  Don't forget about that.
[17:40.400 --> 17:41.480]  So think about the budget.
[17:41.480 --> 17:43.240]  Think about what you're going to need.
[17:43.240 --> 17:44.240]  Plan ahead.
[17:44.240 --> 17:45.240]  Do you have a helper?
[17:45.240 --> 17:47.120]  Do you need somebody to help you?
[17:47.120 --> 17:48.300]  How are you going to pay them?
[17:48.300 --> 17:49.840]  Don't fuck your helpers over.
[17:49.840 --> 17:54.600]  I know so many friendships, relationships, bro ships, bro mansions that are fucking dead
[17:54.600 --> 17:56.840]  because people have built grows together.
[17:56.840 --> 17:57.840]  One guy had land.
[17:57.840 --> 17:58.840]  One guy had plants.
[17:58.840 --> 18:02.040]  One guy had an idea and they all said at the end of this, we'll split it up three ways
[18:02.040 --> 18:03.320]  and we'll all win.
[18:03.320 --> 18:04.320]  Guess what?
[18:04.320 --> 18:06.160]  One guy took all the shit and now two people are mad.
[18:06.160 --> 18:09.600]  Those two people talk shit about guy number three every time they get a fucking chance.
[18:09.600 --> 18:11.900]  Guy number three doesn't have any fucking friends.
[18:11.900 --> 18:13.360]  Shit goes weird when that happens.
[18:13.360 --> 18:15.240]  Don't ruin friendships over growing cannabis.
[18:15.240 --> 18:16.800]  That's not what it is about.
[18:16.800 --> 18:18.640]  Cannabis is to unite us, to unify us.
[18:18.640 --> 18:21.640]  Don't fuck your friends over if you hire them to grow for you.
[18:21.640 --> 18:23.160]  Take good care of the tremors.
[18:23.160 --> 18:26.560]  Don't be a dickhead to the tremors because without them, your product looks like shit.
[18:26.560 --> 18:28.760]  Love and respect all the tremors.
[18:28.760 --> 18:29.760]  Pay the shit out of them.
[18:29.760 --> 18:30.760]  Tip them.
[18:30.760 --> 18:32.440]  All right, where do we go from there?
[18:32.440 --> 18:33.580]  We got the budget figured out.
[18:33.580 --> 18:35.000]  How about security?
[18:35.000 --> 18:36.420]  What are you going to do for security?
[18:36.420 --> 18:38.680]  We talked about your plan for the lawyer.
[18:38.680 --> 18:41.040]  What are you going to do to keep that gross safe and secure?
[18:41.040 --> 18:45.720]  The number one thing that I can recommend for keeping a gross safe and secure is to
[18:45.720 --> 18:47.720]  shut the fuck up.
[18:47.720 --> 18:50.160]  If nobody knows about it, nobody can steal it.
[18:50.160 --> 18:51.640]  Don't tell anybody about it.
[18:51.640 --> 18:52.640]  Nobody needs to know.
[18:52.640 --> 18:53.640]  Your best friend doesn't need to know.
[18:53.640 --> 18:55.980]  Your girlfriend doesn't need to know that girl you brought over.
[18:55.980 --> 18:57.220]  That one night doesn't need to know.
[18:57.220 --> 18:58.700]  That dude from the dispensary doesn't know.
[18:58.700 --> 19:00.940]  Your friend at work doesn't need to know.
[19:00.940 --> 19:03.020]  Nobody needs to know but you.
[19:03.020 --> 19:06.060]  That way nobody's mooching off you when it's harvest time also.
[19:06.060 --> 19:08.020]  Nobody needs to know about that plan out there.
[19:08.020 --> 19:09.720]  If they can see it, there's a problem.
[19:09.720 --> 19:13.100]  Keep it where nobody can see it because seeing that plan invites thieves.
[19:13.100 --> 19:17.320]  A lot of people are not thieves until you wave some shit in front of their face.
[19:17.320 --> 19:21.940]  If you go, hey look, 10 foot tall weed plant, free weed, free weed, free weed for a week,
[19:21.940 --> 19:24.680]  for two weeks, for three weeks, they're just watching it get bigger.
[19:24.680 --> 19:27.640]  By the end of the fourth week, a motherfucker is going to jump a fence and get your weed
[19:27.640 --> 19:29.320]  and you're just taunting them at this point.
[19:29.320 --> 19:30.880]  So think about security.
[19:30.880 --> 19:33.160]  Keep your shit safe, protected, covered.
[19:33.160 --> 19:34.840]  Be smart about it.
[19:34.840 --> 19:38.600]  I know people that say nobody's going to jump this fence and get that.
[19:38.600 --> 19:41.680]  What the fuck neighborhood do you live in?
[19:41.680 --> 19:43.240]  Somebody's going to jump that fence and get that shit.
[19:43.240 --> 19:46.920]  I think the other way because of where I'm from, where I was raised, that shit's going
[19:46.920 --> 19:47.920]  to get stolen.
[19:47.920 --> 19:48.920]  That's just how it is.
[19:48.920 --> 19:51.640]  If you leave something outside where I'm from, that's just like saying it's free.
[19:51.640 --> 19:53.680]  It's just putting a fucking free sign on it where I'm from.
[19:53.680 --> 19:56.480]  So step up your security, get your shit prepared.
[19:56.480 --> 19:59.000]  Also keep in mind, booby traps are illegal.
[19:59.000 --> 20:02.400]  If you guys set up a booby trap to protect your girl and somebody gets hurt, you did
[20:02.400 --> 20:03.400]  commit a crime.
[20:03.400 --> 20:07.400]  You can be charged with the original cannabis crime and an assault charge and a booby trap
[20:07.400 --> 20:08.400]  charge.
[20:08.400 --> 20:09.400]  Don't do that kind of shit.
[20:09.400 --> 20:14.040]  Also, if law enforcement were to stumble into that booby trap, that's an extra charge.
[20:14.040 --> 20:15.040]  I don't know.
[20:15.040 --> 20:17.960]  Maybe some people don't care about the rules and laws, but keep in mind, booby traps are
[20:17.960 --> 20:18.960]  an extra crime.
[20:18.960 --> 20:20.080]  You'll get an extra trouble for that.
[20:20.080 --> 20:21.760]  All right, where are we going from here?
[20:21.840 --> 20:25.440]  We have got some of the most important part is going to start coming up now.
[20:25.440 --> 20:29.040]  Males and females and tested cuts is what I've got written on my list.
[20:29.040 --> 20:32.320]  You guys, at the end of the grow season, in the middle of the grow season, I start seeing
[20:32.320 --> 20:34.800]  people post really heartbreaking pictures.
[20:34.800 --> 20:40.880]  I see people posting six foot tall, 10 foot tall plants that are as big around as a Volkswagen
[20:40.880 --> 20:44.440]  and they're super bummed out because they just found out that that boy is either interest
[20:44.440 --> 20:48.200]  or that that plan is either a boy or an intersex plant.
[20:48.200 --> 20:50.640]  This is easily, easily preventable.
[20:50.640 --> 20:54.000]  The key to this is don't run into untested cuts outside.
[20:54.000 --> 20:58.680]  Don't put some shit outside that you did not run indoors one time and establish what that
[20:58.680 --> 20:59.680]  plant is.
[20:59.680 --> 21:00.680]  Is it a boy?
[21:00.680 --> 21:01.680]  Is it a girl?
[21:01.680 --> 21:02.680]  Is it intersex?
[21:02.680 --> 21:03.680]  Is it a mutant?
[21:03.680 --> 21:05.080]  Is it a total piece of shit?
[21:05.080 --> 21:07.760]  Don't put plants outside until you know what they are.
[21:07.760 --> 21:13.360]  I do understand that it can be challenging to acquire or obtain seeds or clones or something
[21:13.360 --> 21:14.360]  to grow this year.
[21:14.360 --> 21:15.360]  I get it.
[21:15.360 --> 21:16.360]  You might be new.
[21:16.360 --> 21:20.540]  You might be in a place where there's a limited or minimal or maybe no access, but still you've
[21:20.540 --> 21:22.220]  got to be very careful.
[21:22.220 --> 21:26.340]  If you put a male plant outside and you don't know it's a male plant, that male plant could
[21:26.340 --> 21:32.460]  flower and pollinate every crop for miles where I am in the city of Pueblo, Colorado.
[21:32.460 --> 21:33.500]  We've got a lot of grows here.
[21:33.500 --> 21:35.660]  A lot of people like to grow outdoors.
[21:35.660 --> 21:39.580]  There are also many commercial grow facilities just a few miles from me.
[21:39.580 --> 21:40.580]  They grow outdoors.
[21:40.580 --> 21:42.620]  They've got outdoor grow facilities.
[21:42.620 --> 21:47.020]  If one of us busted out a male plant and let it just full on skeet pollen everywhere for
[21:47.020 --> 21:50.740]  a week, we would ruin crops, not just a crop.
[21:50.740 --> 21:54.660]  We would ruin crops of crops around here and that is a dick move.
[21:54.660 --> 21:59.340]  Don't be that guy to let a male plant go and ruined everybody else's crop because you are
[21:59.340 --> 22:01.220]  not a responsible grower.
[22:01.220 --> 22:02.460]  I know it's hard to get the plants.
[22:02.460 --> 22:05.720]  It's what I started with, but maybe you can trust your friends.
[22:05.720 --> 22:11.440]  Maybe you can trust your dispensary, but nobody ever says, Hey, I might have a disease.
[22:11.440 --> 22:12.440]  Everybody says, no, I'm clean.
[22:12.440 --> 22:13.440]  And then guess what?
[22:13.440 --> 22:15.460]  One day you find out you got some shit.
[22:15.460 --> 22:17.540]  Everybody does the same thing with their plants.
[22:17.540 --> 22:20.260]  They give you a clone and they go, bro, my garden is the fucking cleanest.
[22:20.260 --> 22:21.620]  There's no bugs in there.
[22:21.620 --> 22:26.260]  The people that boast and brag the most about having the cleanest garden generally have
[22:26.260 --> 22:28.900]  the worst fucking problems is what I've learned.
[22:28.900 --> 22:31.140]  So be careful where you get your clones from.
[22:31.140 --> 22:36.460]  If they come from a dispensary, if they come from a friend, definitely expect them to have
[22:36.460 --> 22:37.500]  a problem.
[22:37.500 --> 22:41.240]  Expect them to have spider mites, fungus gnats, thrips, something of that nature.
[22:41.240 --> 22:42.240]  Maybe powdery mildew.
[22:42.560 --> 22:46.760]  It is your job to treat those incoming plants for those bugs.
[22:46.760 --> 22:47.760]  You are now the gardener.
[22:47.760 --> 22:48.760]  You're now the farmer.
[22:48.760 --> 22:54.440]  It is your job, your duty, your responsibility to get this crop from beginning to end successfully.
[22:54.440 --> 22:59.560]  That is your only goal as the farmer is to harvest a successful, smokeable, profitable
[22:59.560 --> 23:00.560]  crop.
[23:00.560 --> 23:03.680]  So you've got to get the plants and it is now your job to treat them for bugs and for
[23:03.680 --> 23:08.360]  mildew and make sure that these problems don't expand if they do come with the plants.
[23:08.480 --> 23:13.440]  Now, when you get these plants, if you get seeds or plants or clones is what I'm trying
[23:13.440 --> 23:15.240]  to say, I would test them.
[23:15.240 --> 23:16.680]  That's why I'm saying get them now.
[23:16.680 --> 23:17.900]  It is March.
[23:17.900 --> 23:21.980]  This would give us time to at least sex test our plants.
[23:21.980 --> 23:23.440]  It is very easy.
[23:23.440 --> 23:28.280]  You can run a small plant indoors and if you put it under 12 hours of lighting or it's
[23:28.280 --> 23:34.320]  12 on and 12 off in about 10 to 14 days, that plant will show you if it's a male or a female.
[23:34.320 --> 23:35.760]  Don't put the boys outside.
[23:35.760 --> 23:38.140]  Call them, chop them down, throw them away.
[23:38.140 --> 23:40.700]  Definitely put female plants outside.
[23:40.700 --> 23:44.340]  Definitely do a sex test before you put things outside because like I said, we don't want
[23:44.340 --> 23:47.780]  that male plant out there ruining everybody's garden.
[23:47.780 --> 23:51.500]  Now something else to think about is that clone may have been tested by your friend.
[23:51.500 --> 23:54.900]  It may have been ran by your friend, but do you trust their selection?
[23:54.900 --> 24:00.580]  I like to grow from seed indoors, make my selections, then put those selections outdoors.
[24:00.580 --> 24:02.740]  Your first run with the plant shouldn't be outdoors.
[24:02.740 --> 24:05.080]  I understand that not all of us have an indoor setup.
[24:05.080 --> 24:09.480]  We can't all get plants and clones and test them, but ideally you would get a pack of
[24:09.480 --> 24:15.000]  seeds, do a pheno hunt indoors, find the good one, then put it outside.
[24:15.000 --> 24:18.760]  One of the important things I want to get to is maybe that clone that you got from your
[24:18.760 --> 24:24.480]  friend was awesome in his indoor grow or in her indoor grow or maybe in his or her indoor
[24:24.480 --> 24:28.680]  grow or outdoor grow in California, but where are you outdoors?
[24:28.680 --> 24:32.400]  Maybe that plant that was selected in NorCal won't do the best in Virginia.
[24:32.400 --> 24:36.120]  Maybe something that was selected in Jamaica and grew amazingly there won't grow as well
[24:36.120 --> 24:37.400]  in upstate New York.
[24:37.400 --> 24:40.840]  Maybe something that grows really well in upstate New York won't grow as well here in
[24:40.840 --> 24:42.000]  Colorado.
[24:42.000 --> 24:46.160]  There's different environments, different environments is basically a different parameters
[24:46.160 --> 24:48.420]  which these plants have to survive through.
[24:48.420 --> 24:51.000]  Find the plants that work best in your area.
[24:51.000 --> 24:55.280]  If you can find an outdoor grower who's been growing in your area for generations, they
[24:55.280 --> 25:00.200]  probably have the plants that work the best for them for you in that area because they
[25:00.200 --> 25:01.280]  know what to expect.
[25:01.280 --> 25:04.640]  They know that around the middle of August, it's going to get real hot.
[25:04.640 --> 25:06.920]  And then as September goes on, it starts to get real damp.
[25:06.920 --> 25:09.240]  And then by October, it gets foggy.
[25:09.240 --> 25:11.960]  They're going to know the shit to expect and they know the day it's going to snow.
[25:11.960 --> 25:15.920]  And so they know that this plant will finish right before the snow usually comes.
[25:15.920 --> 25:19.060]  So pay attention to those local growers and see what they're growing.
[25:19.060 --> 25:20.320]  Don't fall for just hype.
[25:20.320 --> 25:21.520]  Don't buy shit just for hype.
[25:21.520 --> 25:27.440]  Like I said earlier, it's got to be able to take temperature swings, bugs, humidity, heat,
[25:27.440 --> 25:28.440]  dryness.
[25:28.440 --> 25:32.120]  It's got to handle a lot of shit outdoors that it never got shown indoors.
[25:32.120 --> 25:35.560]  So make sure you're getting clones that are good for the outdoors, not just for an indoor
[25:35.560 --> 25:37.000]  grow environment.
[25:37.000 --> 25:40.320]  So if you're going to buy a pack of seeds, I highly recommend you get, I would recommend
[25:40.320 --> 25:44.300]  if you're going to go straight outdoors, I would definitely recommend feminized seeds
[25:44.300 --> 25:47.100]  that will eliminate the opportunity for male plants.
[25:47.100 --> 25:49.500]  You do still have to keep a close eye on them.
[25:49.500 --> 25:51.840]  There still is the opportunity for intersex plants.
[25:51.840 --> 25:56.200]  You can get problems, mutants, freaks still pay attention, but it will cut the chances
[25:56.200 --> 25:58.160]  in half of finding a boy.
[25:58.160 --> 26:02.360]  It'll cut the chances probably 99% of finding a boy is what I should say.
[26:02.360 --> 26:03.360]  So that'll help you out.
[26:03.360 --> 26:05.840]  You had a 50, 50 chance of getting boys in there.
[26:05.840 --> 26:07.800]  You just cut that part right out of the equation.
[26:07.800 --> 26:09.000]  Now you've got girls.
[26:09.000 --> 26:11.000]  So if you're going to get the seeds, you're going to grow them outdoors.
[26:11.000 --> 26:15.400]  I would definitely sex test them before you put them outside.
[26:15.400 --> 26:18.320]  Don't just run them outside because then you're going to be heartbroken.
[26:18.320 --> 26:22.320]  Or if you do grow them outside, grow extra and pay very close attention and look for
[26:22.320 --> 26:23.320]  the boys.
[26:23.320 --> 26:28.880]  Because like I said, you've got a 50% chance of regular seed being a male plant.
[26:28.880 --> 26:30.640]  So pay very close attention to those plants.
[26:30.640 --> 26:33.160]  You do grow outside if you did not sex test them.
[26:33.160 --> 26:37.480]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers,
[26:37.480 --> 26:40.800]  clone cutters, pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts.

[27:15.080 --> 27:18.480]  Before I wrap it up, I do want to give a big shout out to my buddy, Graybeard.
[27:18.480 --> 27:22.160]  Graybeard is officially running the IRE Genetics Discord.
[27:22.160 --> 27:28.900]  We just reached over 2,000 followers, members on the IRE Army, IRE Genetics Discord.
[27:28.900 --> 27:30.840]  Big shout out to everybody who has joined.
[27:30.840 --> 27:34.140]  If you are looking for the Discord, there will be a link in the show notes and in the
[27:34.140 --> 27:35.140]  video description.
[27:35.140 --> 27:38.440]  I really did want to take a moment to thank everybody for joining.
[27:38.440 --> 27:43.240]  Also want to send a big IRE Army salute, a big Rasta Jeff fist bump to my buddy, Graybeard,
[27:43.240 --> 27:44.580]  for taking care of the Discord.
[27:44.580 --> 27:46.100]  That is a big job.
[27:46.100 --> 27:47.520]  It's a lot of work to do.
[27:47.560 --> 27:50.200]  My buddy, Graybeard, is killing it over there.
[27:50.200 --> 27:51.200]  Thank you for the work, brother.
[27:51.200 --> 27:53.360]  I wanted to make sure you got some love here on the show.
[27:53.360 --> 27:57.360]  He always says that he doesn't need love, doesn't need fist bumps and shout out, but
[27:57.360 --> 28:01.920]  sometimes you got to send a bad motherfucker a thank you shout out just to remind him that
[28:01.920 --> 28:02.920]  he's a bad motherfucker.
[28:02.920 --> 28:04.560]  Shout out to my buddy, Graybeard.
[28:04.560 --> 28:05.560]  Hope you're well.
[28:05.560 --> 28:07.440]  Hope you get a kick out of this shout out right here, brother.
[28:07.440 --> 28:09.920]  Also, one last thing before we wrap it up.
[28:09.920 --> 28:11.320]  Your ad could go right here.
[28:11.320 --> 28:12.320]  That's right.
[28:12.320 --> 28:15.020]  If you've got a product, a service, something you'd like to advertise on the show, I am
[28:15.020 --> 28:17.540]  opening up a couple of ad spots here on the show.
[28:17.540 --> 28:20.260]  I only advertise products I truly believe in.
[28:20.260 --> 28:22.060]  So if you got some bullshit, skip me.
[28:22.060 --> 28:25.120]  But if you've got a product that you think could help the community, help out the people
[28:25.120 --> 28:28.460]  that are interested in this show, if we can help each other, help each other, I would
[28:28.460 --> 28:30.120]  be more than happy to do that.
[28:30.120 --> 28:31.120]  Send me a message.
[28:31.120 --> 28:32.120]  Really easy.
[28:32.120 --> 28:33.120]  Grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[28:33.120 --> 28:36.580]  I'll get you all set up with the advertising information that you do need.
[28:36.580 --> 28:37.580]  All right.
[28:37.580 --> 28:39.140]  That is really all I've got for you for this episode.
[28:39.140 --> 28:40.140]  Thanks once again for listening.
[28:40.140 --> 28:43.060]  I want to give a big shout out to the Painted Lady.
[28:43.060 --> 28:46.500]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
