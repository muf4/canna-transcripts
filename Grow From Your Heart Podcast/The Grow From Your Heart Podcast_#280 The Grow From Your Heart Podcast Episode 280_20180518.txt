[00:21.000 --> 00:23.000]  Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit.
[00:23.000 --> 00:24.000]  Man, what you gonna do now?
[00:24.000 --> 00:26.000]  What we gonna do right here is go back.
[00:26.000 --> 00:27.000]  Before you going back.
[00:27.000 --> 00:28.000]  Way back.
[00:28.000 --> 00:31.000]  As we go a little something like this.
[00:31.000 --> 00:32.000]  Hit it.
[00:33.000 --> 00:34.000]  Yeah, what's up podcast world?
[00:34.000 --> 00:40.000]  It's Thursday and that means it's time for another Throwback Thursday episode of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.

[00:57.000 --> 01:01.000]  here's a block of old episodes of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:03.000 --> 01:18.840]  Welcome back cannabis community.
[01:18.840 --> 01:22.840]  It's time for episode number 169 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:22.840 --> 01:25.840]  Your source for cannabis news, education and conversation.
[01:25.840 --> 01:26.840]  That's right.
[01:26.840 --> 01:30.840]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[01:30.840 --> 01:34.840]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[01:34.840 --> 01:37.840]  this my friends is the podcast for you.
[01:37.840 --> 01:39.840]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:39.840 --> 01:41.840]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[01:41.840 --> 01:45.840]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[01:45.840 --> 01:47.840]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[01:47.840 --> 01:51.840]  Big shout out to Kat, Koot and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:53.840 --> 01:56.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is a frosty cold Thursday evening here in Colorado.
[01:56.840 --> 02:00.840]  It is 20 degrees outside, but that's okay.
[02:00.840 --> 02:05.840]  I'm going to stay nice and warm because the only reason I know it's so cold is because I had to answer the door for the FedEx guy
[02:05.840 --> 02:07.840]  and he just brought me a box of hoodies.
[02:07.840 --> 02:11.840]  I have got some sweet new custom Grow From Your Heart podcast hoodies, you guys.
[02:11.840 --> 02:16.840]  On the front left breast, there's the Grow From Your Heart podcast logo without my face.
[02:16.840 --> 02:18.840]  It's got the, it says Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:18.840 --> 02:23.840]  It's got the red, yellow and green EQ bar, like on your recording equipment or on your old school stereo
[02:23.840 --> 02:25.840]  to let you know you're not blowing up your levels.
[02:25.840 --> 02:30.840]  And then on the back, it's got the Grow From Your Heart podcast logo with the EQ bars.
[02:30.840 --> 02:34.840]  And then it's got my big old face right on there, just like the logo you see on iTunes,
[02:34.840 --> 02:37.840]  just like that logo you see on Stitcher, just like the logo on the website.
[02:37.840 --> 02:42.840]  It is the Grow From Your Heart podcast official logo, and it is now available on the back of a hoodie, you guys.
[02:42.840 --> 02:46.840]  If you are interested in one of those hoodies, send me an email, growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[02:46.840 --> 02:48.840]  I'll teach you how you can get one.
[02:48.840 --> 02:50.840]  I'd love to get one to you.
[02:50.840 --> 02:53.840]  These hoodies, of course, were made by our friends at Handmade Apparel.
[02:53.840 --> 02:56.840]  Big shout out to my friends at Handmade Apparel.
[02:56.840 --> 03:01.840]  If you need some custom printed t-shirts, if you need custom printed hoodies, if you need some hat pins made,
[03:02.840 --> 03:06.840]  ladies and gentlemen, I fully endorse and highly recommend Handmade Apparel.
[03:06.840 --> 03:10.840]  These guys are members of the cannabis community, and I love supporting community members.
[03:10.840 --> 03:14.840]  You can find Handmade Apparel at handmadeapparel.biz.
[03:14.840 --> 03:15.840]  Send them an email.
[03:15.840 --> 03:19.840]  It will get you all of the information that you need to get your stuff printed.
[03:19.840 --> 03:20.840]  Get started with them.
[03:20.840 --> 03:23.840]  Let them know that you heard about them through the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[03:23.840 --> 03:24.840]  Let them know you're listening.
[03:24.840 --> 03:26.840]  Let them know that I sent them your direction.
[03:26.840 --> 03:28.840]  We would both appreciate that.
[03:28.840 --> 03:39.840]  I want to tell a quick story about why I really respect and enjoy the company of Mr. Adam Hand, the founder, the proprietor, the main dude there of Handmade Apparel.
[03:39.840 --> 03:42.840]  Just a quick little rant on why I respect this dude so much.
[03:42.840 --> 03:46.840]  I was at the Denver Cannabis Cup one time in Denver, of course, right?
[03:46.840 --> 03:52.840]  It was at a place called the Exdo Event Center, and the place was too tiny for how many people were in the facility.
[03:52.840 --> 03:54.840]  I was frustrated.
[03:54.840 --> 03:55.840]  It took me too long to park.
[03:55.840 --> 03:57.840]  It took me way too long to get in the facility.
[03:57.840 --> 04:00.840]  When they searched my backpack, they took some shit away from me.
[04:00.840 --> 04:03.840]  They made me give some things away that I planned on taking in, but they wouldn't let me take it in.
[04:03.840 --> 04:05.840]  I wasn't going to wait in line again.
[04:05.840 --> 04:07.840]  That kind of frustrated me.
[04:07.840 --> 04:15.840]  Then when I got in there, the place was so crowded that I literally got stuck in an intersection of people for several minutes and could not go left.
[04:15.840 --> 04:16.840]  I could not go right.
[04:16.840 --> 04:18.840]  I could not go forward, and I could not go backward.
[04:18.840 --> 04:21.840]  I was trapped, and I do not like being trapped.
[04:21.840 --> 04:24.840]  So it put me in a little bit of a shitty mood, to tell you the truth.
[04:25.840 --> 04:33.840]  I get out of that big clusterfuck of people, and the first booth I come upon with familiar faces was the Handmade Apparel and Oil Slick booth.
[04:33.840 --> 04:40.840]  I looked at Adam Hand from Handmade Apparel, and the first thing that flew out of my face was, boy, this is a clusterfuck, isn't it?
[04:40.840 --> 04:42.840]  I know now that was the wrong thing to say.
[04:42.840 --> 04:43.840]  That was the wrong mindset.
[04:43.840 --> 04:50.840]  I know that because Adam Hand looked at me, and he said, brother, I came all the way from Washington for this, and look at all these people that are here having a good time.
[04:50.840 --> 04:52.840]  This is amazing.
[04:52.840 --> 04:56.840]  And it took me about a half a second to snap out of my shitty mood, and I went, this dude's right.
[04:56.840 --> 04:58.840]  I may have had a shitty parking experience.
[04:58.840 --> 05:01.840]  They may have taken away some cans of butane out of my backpack.
[05:01.840 --> 05:07.840]  I may have taken 10 minutes to stand in an intersection with a bunch of high people doing nothing, trying to figure out which way to go.
[05:07.840 --> 05:08.840]  But he's right.
[05:08.840 --> 05:15.840]  This is an amazing cannabis-themed event, and people from all over the world were there smoking weed with me and my friends.
[05:15.840 --> 05:20.840]  So I just needed that quick snap from Adam Hand, and he gave it to me politely and kindly and respectfully.
[05:21.840 --> 05:26.840]  And he's a really kind dude, and he's super polite, so I feel like I've been going on about the Handmade Apparel Crew for a really long time.
[05:26.840 --> 05:29.840]  So much respect, much love to the entire Handmade Crew.
[05:29.840 --> 05:34.840]  Big shout-out to Adam Hand and his beautiful fiancÃ©e, Miss Jackie O at the Oil Slick Crew.
[05:34.840 --> 05:36.840]  Yeah, I support that company.
[05:36.840 --> 05:37.840]  I support those people.
[05:37.840 --> 05:39.840]  I love supporting cannabis community members.
[05:39.840 --> 05:43.840]  I'm going to quit kissing their butts now and move forward a little bit.
[05:43.840 --> 05:44.840]  Hey, you guys, thanks for the hoodies.
[05:44.840 --> 05:46.840]  If you're listening, the Handmade Crew.
[05:46.840 --> 05:48.840]  The hoodies look freaking great, you guys.
[05:48.840 --> 05:50.840]  The printing came out so smooth.
[05:50.840 --> 05:51.840]  You guys do a really good job.
[05:51.840 --> 05:59.840]  My iReed Genetics hoodie that I am actually wearing right now, I've probably been wearing this every day it's cold, every day that it's kind of chilly.
[05:59.840 --> 06:03.840]  I wear this probably for like a year now, and the printing is still perfect.
[06:03.840 --> 06:06.840]  The hoodie's getting a little fuzzy because, you know, it's getting worn.
[06:06.840 --> 06:09.840]  The stitching, it's got some fuzz marks like it's come frayed.
[06:09.840 --> 06:11.840]  But, bro, the printing is solid still.
[06:11.840 --> 06:13.840]  Every bit of printing on here is good.
[06:13.840 --> 06:17.840]  I'm sure that those Grow From Your Heart hoodies are going to look just as good for just as long.
[06:17.840 --> 06:19.840]  So, much love, much respect.
[06:19.840 --> 06:20.840]  I appreciate it.
[06:20.840 --> 06:21.840]  Good job, you guys.
[06:21.840 --> 06:23.840]  I look forward to doing business with you in the future.
[06:23.840 --> 06:24.840]  I need some t-shirts soon.
[06:24.840 --> 06:26.840]  We need some Grow From Your Heart podcast t-shirts.
[06:26.840 --> 06:27.840]  That's what we need.
[06:27.840 --> 06:29.840]  All right, I'm going to move forward.
[06:29.840 --> 06:32.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, I like to keep the listeners updated on my breeding project.
[06:32.840 --> 06:35.840]  You guys know that I've got a breeding project underway.
[06:35.840 --> 06:38.840]  Just a few days ago, I put pollen on those girls.
[06:38.840 --> 06:40.840]  You can really see the seeds bulking up.
[06:40.840 --> 06:41.840]  It's only been a few days.
[06:41.840 --> 06:45.840]  I'm not sure how far apart those episodes are going to come out, so I'm not going to quote how many days.
[06:45.840 --> 06:49.840]  It's been several days, a few several days, and the seeds are bulking up.
[06:49.840 --> 06:54.840]  All of the pistils on the plants are really brown and curled up, so you can tell that pollen got in there.
[06:54.840 --> 06:56.840]  I applied so much pollen, you guys.
[06:56.840 --> 06:57.840]  I kind of got a little bit crazy.
[06:57.840 --> 07:02.840]  I put more pollen than I should have, but I wanted to make sure to have a shit ton of seeds, and it is working.
[07:02.840 --> 07:05.840]  So, let me give you an update and a reminder of what I bred.
[07:05.840 --> 07:07.840]  I took an Arise F1 male.
[07:07.840 --> 07:08.840]  That's Golden Goat.
[07:08.840 --> 07:13.840]  The Golden Goat female was pollinated by a Daybreaker male that made Arise.
[07:13.840 --> 07:23.840]  I used that Arise male, and I have pollinated Cookies and Cream, White Widow, Lemon Jeffrey, Grateful Dog, and several other beautiful females.
[07:23.840 --> 07:27.840]  There's a Flow plant in there they got pollinated also, and there are some...
[07:27.840 --> 07:28.840]  What else is in there?
[07:28.840 --> 07:33.840]  There are other Arise phenotypes in there so that I can make more of the Arise F2.
[07:33.840 --> 07:41.840]  So, here in about seven weeks or so, those should be done, and we'll get to see what Cookies and Cream crossed to Arise does
[07:41.840 --> 07:44.840]  and what White Widow crossed to the Arise will do.
[07:44.840 --> 07:52.840]  My goal, you guys, that Cookies and Cream plant was one of the most resinous, frostiest plants I've ever grown, and the taste on it was great.
[07:52.840 --> 08:00.840]  That plant made some of the best bubble hash and ice hash I have ever smoked, and it yielded really heavy on the shatter.
[08:00.840 --> 08:06.840]  When we make shatter, we would get more shatter than it from any other strain, but the problem was if you wanted bud form,
[08:06.840 --> 08:15.840]  it made buds the size of my thumb tip, just like the top of my thumb, just little popcorn balls up the stick, all the way up and down the stick,
[08:15.840 --> 08:21.840]  just little popcorn balls, and they're shitty to trim, and it doesn't put out a lot of weight, and the plant's just kind of...
[08:21.840 --> 08:22.840]  It's just wispy to grow.
[08:22.840 --> 08:23.840]  It's not the best grower.
[08:23.840 --> 08:35.840]  So, I hit it with the Arise pollen because Arise makes these gigantic, huge colas, and I'm hoping that I can get those giant colas with as much resin and as much flavor
[08:35.840 --> 08:39.840]  and carry that Arise growth tree over to the Cookies and Cream.
[08:39.840 --> 08:48.840]  Now, the Arise females have been testing in the 29% to 31% THCA range, so there's a lot of THC available to put into this cross.
[08:48.840 --> 08:56.840]  I've never had the Cookies and Cream cross tested myself, but I've seen it test high because it's available at Kind Love and several other dispensaries,
[08:56.840 --> 09:03.840]  so I'm hoping I get that really high THC, THCA value on the test there with that cross.
[09:03.840 --> 09:04.840]  So, look forward to that.
[09:04.840 --> 09:06.840]  I'll post pictures of it when those seeds are ready.
[09:06.840 --> 09:10.840]  I will grow them, and then I'll post pictures of that on Instagram.
[09:10.840 --> 09:13.840]  I am ireee underscore genetics on Instagram if you want to check out the progress.
[09:13.840 --> 09:16.840]  There's also a whole bunch of good stuff up on there right now.
[09:16.840 --> 09:18.840]  I'll also let you guys on the podcast know how it's going.
[09:18.840 --> 09:19.840]  So, that's my breeding update.
[09:19.840 --> 09:28.840]  Speaking of updates, I read an email on the last episode from a man who wants to start a cannabis podcast in the UK,
[09:28.840 --> 09:31.840]  and since I read that email, he has responded.
[09:31.840 --> 09:34.840]  I'm not going to read the whole email, but I'll just read a quick portion of it.
[09:34.840 --> 09:38.840]  He says, hey, dude, Ross here messaging off the podcast email address.
[09:38.840 --> 09:39.840]  Great show today.
[09:39.840 --> 09:43.840]  Some great advice, but I must apologize, though, as I wasn't clear.
[09:43.840 --> 09:47.840]  I actually met Mrs. May, Theresa May, our new female prime minister.
[09:47.840 --> 09:51.840]  Seems she's okay and passionate, and here's where I screwed up, you guys,
[09:51.840 --> 09:53.840]  and I knew I was saying something wrong when I said it last time.
[09:53.840 --> 10:00.840]  It felt wrong when I said it, but he said, MP means members of parliament are equivalent to your Congress.
[10:01.840 --> 10:03.840]  He said, I'm sorry if I'm wrong.
[10:03.840 --> 10:07.840]  He said, our members are equivalent to your Congress, I think, and I'm sorry if I'm wrong.
[10:07.840 --> 10:12.840]  However, we do also have a military police, but they're strictly military, nothing political.
[10:12.840 --> 10:21.840]  So, what I said, excuse for the throat clearing, he wrote a message saying that the prime minister was okay, was possible.
[10:21.840 --> 10:25.840]  I don't remember what the stance was right now because I'm talking too fast trying to read an email,
[10:25.840 --> 10:33.840]  but he said that the MPs were supporting cannabis, and I didn't know what MP stood for,
[10:33.840 --> 10:36.840]  and the American in me took it as military police.
[10:36.840 --> 10:40.840]  Then I was just reading an email quickly and trying to come up with a solution quickly,
[10:40.840 --> 10:43.840]  and I spouted out military police, and I was wrong as shit, you guys.
[10:43.840 --> 10:48.840]  MP, in this dude's meaning, stood for members of parliament, so I was wrong.
[10:48.840 --> 10:50.840]  I apologize for that.
[10:50.840 --> 10:51.840]  I hope I didn't embarrass your country.
[10:51.840 --> 10:53.840]  I hope I didn't embarrass myself too much by saying that.
[10:53.840 --> 10:56.840]  I wasn't trying to be offensive, so I apologize, and thanks for correcting me.
[10:56.840 --> 10:58.840]  I like to be corrected, you guys.
[10:58.840 --> 10:59.840]  I like to be right.
[10:59.840 --> 11:02.840]  If I'm wrong on something, feel free to correct me.
[11:02.840 --> 11:07.840]  And then he also goes on to say, for you to say you're confident that I'm the right person from how I write means a lot,
[11:07.840 --> 11:10.840]  as I'm that guy who thinks he sucks at everything.
[11:10.840 --> 11:12.840]  Dude, you don't suck at everything.
[11:12.840 --> 11:13.840]  You're going to be a great podcaster.
[11:13.840 --> 11:19.840]  He also goes on to talk about how he is acquiring equipment and getting his computer ready for the podcast.
[11:19.840 --> 11:21.840]  I look forward to hearing your show.
[11:21.840 --> 11:26.840]  He says he's going to record a couple episodes and send them to me so that I can give him some pointers.
[11:26.840 --> 11:30.840]  Make sure that you get a couple good episodes recorded, and then when you launch into iTunes,
[11:30.840 --> 11:34.840]  make sure that you get all of your friends to listen.
[11:34.840 --> 11:38.840]  Make sure you have a Twitter account set up so that you can tweet those podcasts out.
[11:38.840 --> 11:45.840]  Maybe start a Twitter account now and start developing relationships with friends on Twitter so that when you do launch material,
[11:45.840 --> 11:48.840]  they'll be there already waiting to retweet your podcast.
[11:48.840 --> 11:49.840]  That's something you could work on.
[11:49.840 --> 11:52.840]  Go ahead and send me a few episodes when they're ready.
[11:52.840 --> 11:54.840]  I would love to listen to them and give you some guidance.
[11:54.840 --> 11:56.840]  I will do it for you.
[11:56.840 --> 11:57.840]  I would love to do it.
[11:57.840 --> 11:58.840]  I listen to a lot of podcasts, you guys.
[11:58.840 --> 12:01.840]  I spend all day working on plants, so I've always got an earbud in my ear.
[12:01.840 --> 12:04.840]  Just listen and do a podcast.
[12:04.840 --> 12:08.840]  Somebody actually asked me to mention what podcasts I listen to.
[12:08.840 --> 12:09.840]  Here, I've got my phone in my hand.
[12:09.840 --> 12:14.840]  I'll just grab this, and I'll scroll through really quickly here, and I'll tell you just a few of the podcasts I listen to.
[12:14.840 --> 12:16.840]  These are the random emails I get, you guys.
[12:16.840 --> 12:18.840]  People ask me, what podcasts are you listening to?
[12:19.840 --> 12:20.840]  I'm going to answer that.
[12:20.840 --> 12:22.840]  I'm just going to go in order from the top.
[12:22.840 --> 12:23.840]  Doug loves movies.
[12:23.840 --> 12:24.840]  Doug loves minis.
[12:24.840 --> 12:26.840]  Then this one's on here, but it may get deleted real soon.
[12:26.840 --> 12:28.840]  It's called Julian Loves Music.
[12:28.840 --> 12:30.840]  It's really not the greatest podcast.
[12:30.840 --> 12:31.840]  It's a spin-off.
[12:31.840 --> 12:33.840]  It's a copy of Doug Loves Movies.
[12:33.840 --> 12:36.840]  It's fun sometimes.
[12:36.840 --> 12:37.840]  Of course, the Joe Rogan Experience.
[12:37.840 --> 12:39.840]  I listen to that more than anything.
[12:39.840 --> 12:41.840]  The Church of What's Happening Now with Joey Coco Diaz.
[12:41.840 --> 12:43.840]  The Doug Stanhope Podcast.
[12:43.840 --> 12:45.840]  The Smartest Man in the World Podcast.
[12:45.840 --> 12:47.840]  The Fighter and the Kid.
[12:47.840 --> 12:48.840]  Good Times with Steve Simone.
[12:48.840 --> 12:50.840]  The Ari Shafir Skeptic Tank.
[12:50.840 --> 12:52.840]  Bert Kast Podcast with Bert Kreischer.
[12:52.840 --> 12:56.840]  Sometimes that's hard to listen to, you guys, but sometimes there's good episodes.
[12:56.840 --> 12:58.840]  How Comedy Works with Wendy Curtis and Rick Kearns.
[12:58.840 --> 13:00.840]  That's the Comedy Works Podcast.
[13:00.840 --> 13:01.840]  The Nerdist.
[13:01.840 --> 13:02.840]  Truth and Eliza.
[13:02.840 --> 13:05.840]  There are a lot more, you guys, but that's mainly what I listen to.
[13:05.840 --> 13:07.840]  I'm getting to the weed section.
[13:07.840 --> 13:10.840]  I've been listening to the Spliff Podcast.
[13:10.840 --> 13:12.840]  I used to listen to the Adam Dunn Show.
[13:12.840 --> 13:14.840]  I haven't paid attention to that one lately.
[13:14.840 --> 13:16.840]  The Dude Grows is a great podcast.
[13:16.840 --> 13:17.840]  It's in my feed.
[13:17.840 --> 13:18.840]  I don't get a chance to listen to it.
[13:18.840 --> 13:20.840]  Legion of Skanks is good.
[13:20.840 --> 13:26.840]  Then down on the bottom of my list, Monday Morning Podcast with Bill Burr and Fitz Dog Radio.
[13:26.840 --> 13:30.840]  Somehow, I'm not sure when I subscribe to this, but Dean Del Rey's Let There Be Talk.
[13:30.840 --> 13:31.840]  Dean Del Rey's a good comedian.
[13:31.840 --> 13:33.840]  He's a rock and roll dude.
[13:33.840 --> 13:36.840]  I don't know if I've ever listened to his podcast, but it's in my feed.
[13:36.840 --> 13:38.840]  Those are the podcasts I'm listening to.
[13:38.840 --> 13:42.840]  All right, let's put the show back on track a little bit and talk a little bit about cannabis.
[13:42.840 --> 13:47.840]  I want to read some listener emails because when the listeners send emails, I know that I'm answering the questions you want to hear.
[13:47.840 --> 13:50.840]  I'm actually getting somebody's attention and helping somebody out.
[13:50.840 --> 13:54.840]  This one comes from a regular listener and someone that contacts me a lot.
[13:54.840 --> 13:55.840]  This one's from FastBerry.
[13:55.840 --> 13:56.840]  What's up, FastBerry?
[13:56.840 --> 13:57.840]  Good to hear from you again.
[13:57.840 --> 14:00.840]  This email goes like this.
[14:00.840 --> 14:02.840]  As always, really enjoy the podcast.
[14:02.840 --> 14:04.840]  I have a few quick questions for you.
[14:04.840 --> 14:06.840]  Then he did really list a couple few questions here.
[14:06.840 --> 14:09.840]  We'll see how long these take, and then we might read some more emails.
[14:09.840 --> 14:10.840]  We might do a product review.
[14:10.840 --> 14:12.840]  Depends on how much time we have.
[14:12.840 --> 14:14.840]  The email goes like this.
[14:14.840 --> 14:19.840]  Have you always grown using bottled nutrients, and why or why not?
[14:19.840 --> 14:21.840]  Mostly, I use bottled nutrients.
[14:21.840 --> 14:23.840]  I prefer the bottled nutrients.
[14:23.840 --> 14:24.840]  It's how I learned.
[14:24.840 --> 14:26.840]  I have reached...
[14:26.840 --> 14:28.840]  Okay, so I guess this is why.
[14:28.840 --> 14:37.840]  I've had my best test results and my best flavor, and some of my favorite crops have come from my trusted source of nutrients that I have...
[14:37.840 --> 14:39.840]  I've used so many brands.
[14:39.840 --> 14:41.840]  I have used Advanced Nutrients.
[14:41.840 --> 14:42.840]  I've used Psyco.
[14:42.840 --> 14:44.840]  I have used Fox Farms.
[14:44.840 --> 14:47.840]  I've used Aurora Soul Synthetics.
[14:47.840 --> 14:49.840]  I think that's the name of that stuff.
[14:49.840 --> 14:51.840]  I have used Roots.
[14:51.840 --> 14:52.840]  I don't remember.
[14:52.840 --> 14:55.840]  I may be mixing Aurora and then Soul Synthetics.
[14:55.840 --> 14:57.840]  Those might be two different things.
[14:57.840 --> 15:00.840]  I've used the Roots stuff with the Buddha-looking bottles.
[15:00.840 --> 15:02.840]  I have used Dutch Master.
[15:02.840 --> 15:03.840]  I have used...
[15:03.840 --> 15:06.840]  I have used Dyna-Gro or Pro-Tech.
[15:06.840 --> 15:07.840]  It's Dyna-Gro.
[15:07.840 --> 15:08.840]  I've used so many brands.
[15:08.840 --> 15:13.840]  My favorite, honestly, is Botanicare Pure Blend Pro bottles.
[15:13.840 --> 15:21.840]  The Cocoa Base Grow and Bloom with a little bit of Liquid Karma, some CalMag, whatever.
[15:21.840 --> 15:27.840]  There's a whole line of stuff, but I prefer most of the Botanicare stuff from the Pure Blend Pro line.
[15:27.840 --> 15:32.840]  And then I added a couple other things in there, just a couple of other things that I probably won't mention too much.
[15:32.840 --> 15:35.840]  That's mainly my main mix.
[15:35.840 --> 15:38.840]  There's some worm castings in there, and I put in some stuff to get the roots going a little bit.
[15:38.840 --> 15:42.840]  And then I add my own couple of little proprietary things in there.
[15:42.840 --> 15:44.840]  I also like a product called Humboldt Honey.
[15:44.840 --> 15:47.840]  If I'm using Botanicare, put some Humboldt Honey in there.
[15:47.840 --> 15:52.840]  But those things, from the bottles, I grew a really great crop.
[15:52.840 --> 15:55.840]  Every plant in there got a super high test.
[15:55.840 --> 15:59.840]  Everything tasted amazing, and the weight was where I needed it, so I feel like I fell in love with it.
[15:59.840 --> 16:02.840]  It was like I hit gold, and I don't really want to change from there.
[16:02.840 --> 16:07.840]  A long time ago, I had Sean come on the show, and he started hyping the Organic as Fuck methods.
[16:07.840 --> 16:09.840]  He started showing me a whole bunch.
[16:09.840 --> 16:12.840]  It was great. The product was really great.
[16:12.840 --> 16:16.840]  I had to make too many trips to too many different stores to make that happen for myself.
[16:16.840 --> 16:18.840]  For my lifestyle, it wasn't working.
[16:18.840 --> 16:22.840]  I was working a full-time job. I was running a hundred and something light grow by myself.
[16:22.840 --> 16:31.840]  I didn't have time to hit the worm casting store, the feed store, the hydro store, and then go to Big R to get tubs to mix all this shit in.
[16:31.840 --> 16:33.840]  It was getting a little overwhelming for me.
[16:33.840 --> 16:36.840]  If you've got time to do it, and you can do that, go for it.
[16:36.840 --> 16:41.840]  But I was running a bottle crop and an organic crop, and it was getting to be a little bit tedious.
[16:41.840 --> 16:45.840]  I live in a house, and I'm not the only one that lives here.
[16:45.840 --> 16:51.840]  Trying to do some of the stinky shit bothered some of the other people, so that wasn't cool.
[16:51.840 --> 16:57.840]  If I lived alone, if I was the only one ever here, because sometimes when I mix up a tea,
[16:57.840 --> 17:07.840]  and I put some fish emulsion and stuff in there, and some bokashi, and the stuff that comes out of the kashi bucket, the leachate, the lactic acid bacteria, it stinks up the whole house.
[17:07.840 --> 17:15.840]  If it's in the basement in the back left corner, you can't be in the top story of the house in the top right corner without smelling it, because it is just rank.
[17:15.840 --> 17:17.840]  That's part of why I don't do the organics at home.
[17:17.840 --> 17:24.840]  I would love, honestly, I've been reading about it and thinking about it, I would love to make the shift to no-till organics.
[17:24.840 --> 17:31.840]  I would love to be able to set up some compost in the garage, put a worm farm in the garage, get that sort of a thing going, and then just use ...
[17:31.840 --> 17:36.840]  It sounds really awesome to be able to use the same pots for every cycle.
[17:36.840 --> 17:43.840]  Just cut the plant out, shake the roots off, put another plant in there, put some compost in there, some worm castings in there, and get it going again.
[17:43.840 --> 17:45.840]  That sounds amazing.
[17:45.840 --> 17:48.840]  I have not always grown with bottled nutrients.
[17:48.840 --> 17:50.840]  I've done the organic as fuck method.
[17:50.840 --> 17:53.840]  I've done outdoor stuff that we just did soil.
[17:53.840 --> 17:54.840]  We did amended soil.
[17:54.840 --> 17:55.840]  That sucked.
[17:55.840 --> 17:58.840]  We had one summer where everything got stolen.
[17:58.840 --> 18:00.840]  I've had one ... I had ... Shit.
[18:00.840 --> 18:04.840]  Okay, I'm going to quit talking about that, because I've had multiple summers where everything got fucking stolen, and that sucks.
[18:04.840 --> 18:09.840]  But all my outdoor stuff was amended soils and no bottled nutrients at all.
[18:09.840 --> 18:10.840]  It's fun.
[18:10.840 --> 18:12.840]  I like the bottles.
[18:12.840 --> 18:19.840]  I like the mad scientist feeling of it, but I also like the amended soils and the teas because of the organic feeling, and I'm a dirty hippie.
[18:19.840 --> 18:22.840]  I got dreadlocks, and I like all that natural sort of stuff.
[18:22.840 --> 18:27.840]  So I have not always grown with bottles, and that is kind of why and why not.
[18:27.840 --> 18:29.840]  So I'm going to move on to the next part of your question.
[18:29.840 --> 18:31.840]  Do I like well-made bubble hash?
[18:31.840 --> 18:33.840]  Why or why not?
[18:33.840 --> 18:35.840]  I love some well-made bubble hash.
[18:35.840 --> 18:37.840]  I like some full melt.
[18:37.840 --> 18:40.840]  The Colorado Extract Company makes this.
[18:40.840 --> 18:43.840]  We take ... So we'll grow ... Not we.
[18:43.840 --> 18:49.840]  A commercial grow will grow plants and take off the big leaves and then freeze the buds.
[18:49.840 --> 18:53.840]  Cut them off the sticks and then freeze the buds while they're still wet, so you've got fresh frozen buds.
[18:53.840 --> 18:59.840]  And you take them to ... There are several companies that do it, but Colorado Extract Company made my favorite so far.
[18:59.840 --> 19:10.840]  You take it to these companies, and they'd wash it for you, and they keep ... The whole time they do it, the whole time they do the extraction, they keep your product at I think it's 55 degrees, or it might be 65 degrees.
[19:10.840 --> 19:11.840]  They keep it.
[19:11.840 --> 19:12.840]  The room is that cold.
[19:12.840 --> 19:15.840]  Your product is kept on ice the whole time.
[19:16.840 --> 19:19.840]  The hash that comes out of there, it's sold to you.
[19:19.840 --> 19:30.840]  It's kept in a refrigerator at the dispensary, and a lot of people, the hip kids, bring a little cooler to buy it because it's sold to you still cool, and the resin heads look like beach sand in the container.
[19:30.840 --> 19:34.840]  That's bubble hash because that's full melt hash.
[19:35.840 --> 19:47.840]  We'll take that and fold a piece of parchment paper in half and put it in the middle and heat up the carb cap just a little bit and roll a carb cap out on it, and it presses it out, and it makes a little ... It looks like a piece of shatter at that point.
[19:47.840 --> 19:50.840]  It's just a little thin layer of hash, and you can see through it.
[19:50.840 --> 19:55.840]  And then we take dabs of it like that when it's pressed out, and it just burns so much more smoothly.
[19:55.840 --> 20:02.840]  You can tell by the passion in my voice right now that I'm kind of drooling over a nice dab of some good solventless hash.
[20:02.840 --> 20:05.840]  I do love bubble hash if it's done correctly.
[20:05.840 --> 20:13.840]  The problem is there are too many companies not doing it correctly, and it's too overpriced, and it has to be stored, kept cool.
[20:13.840 --> 20:24.840]  What I do like, they take some of that hash, that really nice 120 or 90 micron bubble hash, and then they press it.
[20:24.840 --> 20:31.840]  They run it through like a rosin press, and the stuff that comes out of that, oh, that is delicious, you guys.
[20:31.840 --> 20:41.840]  It comes out white, and it looks like white silly putty, or the stuff that I used to use when I was in high school and wanted to put posters on the basement wall, but the wall didn't take nails.
[20:41.840 --> 20:43.840]  It's this weird goo tacky stuff.
[20:43.840 --> 20:46.840]  It looked like that, but the dabs out of it were so amazing.
[20:46.840 --> 20:50.840]  It would be so tasty, and I would get really medicated really quickly from it.
[20:50.840 --> 20:52.840]  It was like a full body high.
[20:52.840 --> 20:57.840]  When you smoke shatter, I don't think it gets to my body as much as I think the solventless does.
[20:57.840 --> 21:00.840]  So, yes, obviously I do like that.
[21:00.840 --> 21:04.840]  You say you talk about your favorite strain to breed with.
[21:04.840 --> 21:05.840]  Oh, hold on.
[21:05.840 --> 21:06.840]  Phone just blacked out.
[21:06.840 --> 21:16.840]  You often talk about your favorite strain to breed with of to make hash oil, but if you had to pick a desert island 10 pack of seeds, what would they be?
[21:16.840 --> 21:24.840]  Okay, so I think you said that I talk about a lot of my favorite, let's see, because you kind of stumbled on some words there.
[21:24.840 --> 21:31.840]  Talk about your favorite strain to breed with of to make hash oil, but if you had to pick a desert island 10 pack of seeds, what would they be?
[21:31.840 --> 21:37.840]  So, I'm going to take this as if I had to pick 10 seeds, a 10 pack of seeds, what 10 pack would I pick to be on a desert island?
[21:37.840 --> 21:41.840]  Hopefully, it's a deserted island because if it's on a desert island, it's going to suck trying to grow some cannabis.
[21:41.840 --> 21:43.840]  Hopefully, I've got plenty of clean water.
[21:43.840 --> 21:46.840]  Hopefully, I can find some stuff to make some organic nutrients.
[21:46.840 --> 21:48.840]  There's going to be fish around if I'm on an island, right?
[21:48.840 --> 21:51.840]  I'll be able to find some fish and make some fish nutrients.
[21:51.840 --> 21:55.840]  10 pack of seeds, that's really a challenge.
[21:55.840 --> 22:01.840]  And see, this is going to frustrate a lot of people because I've got a seed vault of my own that nobody has ever had access to.
[22:01.840 --> 22:05.840]  So, probably something like the Lemon Jeffrey Grateful Dog Cross is a really good one.
[22:05.840 --> 22:07.840]  I call that Lemon Sorbet.
[22:07.840 --> 22:11.840]  10 pack of that would be really cool if I were stuck on a deserted island.
[22:11.840 --> 22:20.840]  Grateful Dog might be the one to pick, dude, because it's got the flavor, it's got the aroma, it's got that stank.
[22:20.840 --> 22:21.840]  But here's where I'm going to go weird.
[22:21.840 --> 22:26.840]  Grateful Dog is Feminized Seed and I don't want to be stuck on a deserted island with Feminized Seeds.
[22:26.840 --> 22:28.840]  I want regular seeds so that I can breed.
[22:28.840 --> 22:33.840]  So, yeah, that's such a tough choice.
[22:33.840 --> 22:40.840]  Something I've bred probably, it would have to be one of my creations, something regular, something that came from the Arise might be cool.
[22:40.840 --> 22:42.840]  You know what? Dubwise might be a good one.
[22:42.840 --> 22:45.840]  If I were stuck and people are like, you never even talk about Dubwise.
[22:45.840 --> 22:46.840]  It's easy to grow.
[22:46.840 --> 22:51.840]  It produces huge colas and it's got a couple of good phenotypes.
[22:51.840 --> 22:56.840]  There's a really hazy phenotype and there's a more indica phenotype, but they all test high in THC.
[22:56.840 --> 22:57.840]  So, that would be cool.
[22:57.840 --> 23:10.840]  So, if the Grateful Dog were a regular seed, that would be my pick because then I could get an OG Kush-leaning phenotype, a Chem 91-leaning phenotype, and then I could get a male, and then I could breed, and then I could start doing some shit.
[23:10.840 --> 23:13.840]  And if I had a 10 pack of seeds, that's all I need to make magic happen.
[23:13.840 --> 23:20.840]  If you just left me alone on a deserted island, we would have in-crosses, we would have out-crosses, we would have F6s eventually.
[23:20.840 --> 23:21.840]  I would just go nuts with it.
[23:21.840 --> 23:25.840]  So, if the Grateful Dog were a regular seed, that would be my first choice.
[23:25.840 --> 23:29.840]  The Lemon Jeffrey Grateful Dog is also a feminized seed.
[23:29.840 --> 23:31.840]  So, all my favorites here are becoming feminized.
[23:31.840 --> 23:32.840]  The Cascade would be cool.
[23:32.840 --> 23:34.840]  You know, I might have to say Arise.
[23:34.840 --> 23:37.840]  Arise might be the winner because it's available.
[23:37.840 --> 23:39.840]  I could grab a 10 pack of that right now.
[23:39.840 --> 23:42.840]  But then I start thinking, see, I'm just rambling today.
[23:42.840 --> 23:50.840]  I kind of want to go way old school and say, like, why not some old, like, Brothers Grimseeds or some Mr. Nice Seeds from way back in the day?
[23:50.840 --> 23:56.840]  Because that's when stuff was really neat, way back then, before we started kind of just breeding for a lot of random stuff.
[23:56.840 --> 23:58.840]  The old breeders seem to have more goals in mind.
[23:58.840 --> 24:01.840]  They seem to have more foresight for their breeding.
[24:01.840 --> 24:06.840]  Now, it just seems like everybody's breeding for a lot of hype, and they're trying to jump on the Skittles train or whatever it seems to be next.
[24:07.840 --> 24:08.840]  All right.
[24:08.840 --> 24:12.840]  So, speaking of Skittles, that leads me right into the next part of your question.
[24:12.840 --> 24:18.840]  Fastberry says, I live in Rhode Island and can't really look hard into getting elite clones.
[24:18.840 --> 24:22.840]  If you were me, what cutting should I be looking out for?
[24:22.840 --> 24:24.840]  Well, that's a great question.
[24:24.840 --> 24:28.840]  It kind of depends on what you're looking for, honestly.
[24:28.840 --> 24:31.840]  If you're looking for, like, head stash for yourself, you might want one thing.
[24:31.840 --> 24:34.840]  If you're trying to grow some weight, you might want another thing.
[24:34.840 --> 24:36.840]  If you need an Indica, you want one thing.
[24:36.840 --> 24:38.840]  If you need a Sativa, you want another thing.
[24:38.840 --> 24:42.840]  If you are trying to go for flavor, you might want something else.
[24:42.840 --> 24:46.840]  Right now, what I'm noticing, everything tangy is popular.
[24:46.840 --> 24:49.840]  Strawberry banana tangy, double banana tangy.
[24:49.840 --> 24:51.840]  There's a banana sherbet that goes around.
[24:51.840 --> 24:53.840]  There's a banana split.
[24:53.840 --> 24:57.840]  All of that, like, that Crockett family farm stuff is super popular.
[24:57.840 --> 25:02.840]  The Skittles with a Z, I think they're calling it Skittles because they can't call it Skittles.
[25:02.840 --> 25:03.840]  You know what I'm saying?
[25:03.840 --> 25:05.840]  You can't spell it with a Z.
[25:05.840 --> 25:07.840]  The Skittles is super popular right now.
[25:07.840 --> 25:09.840]  Everybody's loving the Skittles.
[25:09.840 --> 25:10.840]  I don't know what's next.
[25:10.840 --> 25:15.840]  I wish one of my strains was the next hype, but you can't just make it the next hype.
[25:15.840 --> 25:17.840]  Somebody's got to fall in love with it.
[25:17.840 --> 25:18.840]  It's got to be the next hype.
[25:18.840 --> 25:22.840]  So, anything with tangy in it, people are really in love with tangy right now.
[25:22.840 --> 25:26.840]  That strawberry banana tangy type of stuff is really cool.
[25:26.840 --> 25:31.840]  If you want a really heavy producer, straight up tangy works well for you.
[25:31.840 --> 25:36.840]  If you want more of an indica type of tangy product, I would say the taffy was great.
[25:36.840 --> 25:39.840]  So, that sort of stuff is what's really popular right now.
[25:39.840 --> 25:44.840]  It's hard to predict because one day it was Girl Scout cookies.
[25:44.840 --> 25:45.840]  For a long time, it was OG Kush.
[25:45.840 --> 25:47.840]  All you could sell was OG Kush.
[25:47.840 --> 25:52.840]  If you had a bag of OG Kush and a bag of whatever else, that OG Kush would sell first.
[25:52.840 --> 25:55.840]  You could buy triple the OG Kush of everything else because you were going to sell that OG.
[25:55.840 --> 25:57.840]  Everyone wanted OG.
[25:57.840 --> 26:02.840]  Then it was Girl Scout cookies, and then it was Gorilla Glue, and then it was Tangy.
[26:02.840 --> 26:05.840]  Then it was Golden Goat for a little while before that.
[26:05.840 --> 26:08.840]  So, it's hard to predict what's going to be the next hype strain.
[26:08.840 --> 26:12.840]  I guess I hyped up a whole bunch of that Crockett Family Farm stuff.
[26:12.840 --> 26:16.840]  I could also say maybe, what do you want in your garden?
[26:16.840 --> 26:17.840]  You want Arise.
[26:17.840 --> 26:18.840]  You want Cascade.
[26:18.840 --> 26:19.840]  You want Firefly.
[26:19.840 --> 26:21.840]  You want Morning Dew.
[26:21.840 --> 26:22.840]  You want...
[26:22.840 --> 26:25.840]  No, those are all strains that I have made, and I am just trying to push my products,
[26:25.840 --> 26:28.840]  which, I mean, if you want my stuff, that'd be awesome.
[26:28.840 --> 26:31.840]  I think Arise is a really reliable strain, so that's something you want in your garden.
[26:31.840 --> 26:32.840]  Let's see.
[26:32.840 --> 26:34.840]  You said you're in Rhode Island.
[26:34.840 --> 26:39.840]  I'm pretty sure I know some activists and cannabis consumers up in that area,
[26:39.840 --> 26:41.840]  and I am sure that they've got some elite cuts.
[26:41.840 --> 26:42.840]  So, get in touch with me.
[26:42.840 --> 26:46.840]  I will try to put you in touch with some people, and that way, if you need a couple of elites,
[26:46.840 --> 26:48.840]  we can put some good stuff in your hands.
[26:48.840 --> 26:50.840]  I'm all about clone trading.
[26:50.840 --> 26:51.840]  I don't think people should clone hoard.
[26:52.840 --> 26:56.840]  I think sometimes I will keep some stuff back because I'm a breeder,
[26:56.840 --> 27:01.840]  and I don't want everything out because I'm going to breed to things, and that's kind of my magic.
[27:01.840 --> 27:06.840]  But once I give a clone out, I try not to say, hey, don't give that out to people.
[27:06.840 --> 27:10.840]  I feel like once I've given a clone out, that clone's going places.
[27:10.840 --> 27:13.840]  And I know, guys, that if you tell them, hey, don't give this out,
[27:13.840 --> 27:15.840]  the first thing they're going to do is go, oh, yeah?
[27:15.840 --> 27:16.840]  And they're going to give you the middle finger,
[27:16.840 --> 27:19.840]  and they're going to make as many clones of that plant as they possibly can.
[27:19.840 --> 27:21.840]  So I'm all about free trade cloning.
[27:21.840 --> 27:23.840]  I think everybody should have a clone exchange.
[27:23.840 --> 27:25.840]  I'm down to trade seeds for clones.
[27:25.840 --> 27:27.840]  I'm down to trade clones for clones.
[27:27.840 --> 27:28.840]  I'm down to trade clones for seeds.
[27:28.840 --> 27:29.840]  I like that kind of stuff.
[27:29.840 --> 27:30.840]  I think it should keep moving.
[27:30.840 --> 27:34.840]  I think that's how people find the perfect strain for themselves and their gardens
[27:34.840 --> 27:36.840]  and or their medical patients.
[27:36.840 --> 27:38.840]  I think clone trading should happen.
[27:38.840 --> 27:41.840]  So if I can find somebody in your area, or if you can find somebody in your area,
[27:41.840 --> 27:44.840]  wherever you are, whoever you are, if you can find somebody to trade clones with,
[27:44.840 --> 27:45.840]  I highly encourage it.
[27:45.840 --> 27:49.840]  Just make sure that when you get home that you treat those clones for pests,
[27:49.840 --> 27:52.840]  and you also quarantine them to keep them away from the rest of your garden
[27:52.840 --> 27:55.840]  for a few days so that if there is something wrong,
[27:55.840 --> 27:58.840]  you don't go infesting the rest of your garden.
[27:58.840 --> 28:00.840]  All right, that was a long rant.
[28:00.840 --> 28:03.840]  I hope I kind of answered your question on what cuttings you should be looking for,
[28:03.840 --> 28:06.840]  any of that crocket stuff, any irigenetic stuff.
[28:06.840 --> 28:09.840]  Also, alien rock candy has been real popular.
[28:09.840 --> 28:11.840]  So if there's alien rock candy available, grab that.
[28:11.840 --> 28:14.840]  It's been real popular here in Colorado lately.
[28:14.840 --> 28:17.840]  All right, so FastBerry, let's see what else he has to say.
[28:17.840 --> 28:19.840]  He said, sorry for so many questions.
[28:19.840 --> 28:24.840]  It's just a few of the thoughts around the old noggin, the last podcast.
[28:24.840 --> 28:26.840]  My address is, no, I'm just kidding.
[28:26.840 --> 28:28.840]  He does give me his address so that I can send him some stickers and stuff,
[28:28.840 --> 28:31.840]  but I won't bust you out and read that on the show.
[28:31.840 --> 28:33.840]  I do want to thank you once again for sending me an email.
[28:33.840 --> 28:37.840]  We've been friends online for quite a while now, and I do appreciate the interaction.
[28:37.840 --> 28:39.840]  If anybody out there has a question or they'd like to say something,
[28:39.840 --> 28:40.840]  feel free to send me an email.
[28:40.840 --> 28:42.840]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[28:42.840 --> 28:43.840]  I would love to hear from you.
[28:43.840 --> 28:46.840]  Yes, I do have a ton of emails to respond to.
[28:46.840 --> 28:49.840]  I plan on answering as many of them as I can on the show.
[28:49.840 --> 28:51.840]  I've got messages from Instagram.
[28:51.840 --> 28:52.840]  I've got messages from Facebook.
[28:52.840 --> 28:53.840]  I've got a ton of emails.
[28:53.840 --> 28:55.840]  I'm working my way through them.
[28:55.840 --> 28:57.840]  I can only put out so much content.
[28:57.840 --> 28:59.840]  I've secretly been working on another project.
[28:59.840 --> 29:01.840]  In a few days here, I may make an announcement about it.
[29:01.840 --> 29:02.840]  But right now, I need to keep that under wraps.
[29:02.840 --> 29:04.840]  But it's been taking a lot of my time.
[29:04.840 --> 29:07.840]  So that's why there was not a Thursday episode this week.
[29:07.840 --> 29:10.840]  I took last Thursday off for the Thanksgiving holiday.
[29:10.840 --> 29:12.840]  There was not a Thursday episode for two weeks in a row now.
[29:12.840 --> 29:15.840]  But I will get those coming again once I get back on my schedule.
[29:15.840 --> 29:17.840]  I've got something else going.
[29:17.840 --> 29:18.840]  It took up a lot of my time.
[29:18.840 --> 29:19.840]  I'm back on the flow now.
[29:19.840 --> 29:22.840]  So I'll be able to put out more regular quality episodes again.
[29:22.840 --> 29:25.840]  Again, if you want to hear something, if you've got a question, a comment,
[29:25.840 --> 29:26.840]  just feel free.
[29:26.840 --> 29:27.840]  Send me an email.
[29:27.840 --> 29:29.840]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[29:29.840 --> 29:33.840]  I would love to hear from you.
[29:33.840 --> 29:36.840]  All right, I want to take a second and tell you guys about a service called Patreon.
[29:36.840 --> 29:39.840]  I recently made a Patreon account for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[29:39.840 --> 29:41.840]  If you want to check it out, it is patreon.com.
[29:41.840 --> 29:44.840]  It's patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[29:44.840 --> 29:47.840]  Patreon is P-A-T-R-E-O-N.
[29:47.840 --> 29:51.840]  So it's patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[29:51.840 --> 29:56.840]  What Patreon is is a service that will allow my listeners to donate financial
[29:56.840 --> 30:01.840]  contributions to the podcast to help me pay for the web hosting of this show.
[30:01.840 --> 30:06.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, iregeneticscolorado.com costs a little over $300
[30:06.840 --> 30:07.840]  per year for me to keep up.
[30:07.840 --> 30:10.840]  And that is where all of the podcasts are hosted.
[30:10.840 --> 30:15.880]  100 episodes there. I am just trying to offset that financial burden out of my
[30:15.880 --> 30:20.320]  pocket by asking the listeners to contribute to my Patreon account. You can
[30:20.320 --> 30:24.400]  contribute as little as $1 per month. And I do not think there is a limit. I
[30:24.400 --> 30:27.680]  think you can put as many zeros on the end of that as you would like. So I
[30:27.680 --> 30:30.480]  would appreciate it if you would sign up at Patreon if you feel like this
[30:30.480 --> 30:33.720]  podcast is giving you some value. If you've learned something, if you've been
[30:33.720 --> 30:37.480]  entertained, $1 a month is all I ask. I'm not begging. If it's something you can
[30:37.480 --> 30:41.120]  do, that is excellent. I'm just trying to offset the cost of my website so that
[30:41.120 --> 30:45.120]  we can keep the show up for free. The sponsorships do help. I've got some
[30:45.120 --> 30:48.320]  sponsors on board now. That really helps a lot. But if you'd like to go to the
[30:48.320 --> 30:52.840]  Patreon account, it is patreon.com slash growfromyourheart. Go check out the
[30:52.840 --> 30:55.280]  page. Even if you don't want to contribute, go check out what I did. Go
[30:55.280 --> 30:59.160]  check out what I wrote. I would love your clicks on the website. Speaking of
[30:59.160 --> 31:02.120]  clicks on websites, I'd love it if you follow me on Facebook. Check out the
[31:02.120 --> 31:05.600]  Grow From Your Heart podcast on Facebook. Also, find me on Twitter. It's
[31:06.520 --> 31:10.000]  at GFYHpodcast. I would love it if you follow me on Instagram where I post a
[31:10.000 --> 31:13.840]  whole bunch of great cannabis photography. Check me out. It's irie
[31:13.880 --> 31:18.600]  underscore genetics. I would love to see you there. All right. I want to thank
[31:18.600 --> 31:21.080]  everybody once again for listening. I want to give a huge shout out to my boy
[31:21.080 --> 31:25.400]  Hydro in Vegas. Bro, that mustache is rocking. I also want to give a huge
[31:25.400 --> 31:29.720]  shout out to my ninja Spence. Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a
[31:29.720 --> 31:30.320]  hug for me.
[31:35.600 --> 31:39.360]  In this life, one thing counts in the bank.
[31:51.920 --> 31:55.760]  I spent a lot of time working on the bottom line mind on the money. So I
[31:55.760 --> 31:59.960]  guess the money's on my mind. Yeah, tricks I give up for the dollar sign.
[32:00.160 --> 32:05.280]  Even chicks I want fine. On top of being good with the look. I need a
[32:05.280 --> 32:08.840]  friend to kitchen fixing up and cooking. You can find me in the hood
[32:08.840 --> 32:13.920]  with the crooks. Getting my feet wet like I suck my foot in the book. To get
[32:13.920 --> 32:19.400]  the money I'll be harming your head. Dead leaving with your own. Everybody
[32:19.400 --> 32:25.440]  starving for bread. Not me. Here. Try my margarine spread. I'm still me like
[32:25.440 --> 32:29.200]  Jenny from the block with a piggy bank brain bunch of pennies for my thoughts.
[32:29.200 --> 32:33.560]  Put your Betty in the top. Yeah, watch me bounce. Because one thing counts.
[32:36.280 --> 32:36.920]  One thing
[32:40.680 --> 32:41.000]  this
[32:43.280 --> 32:43.400]  is
[32:48.480 --> 32:49.440]  in the bank.
[32:56.720 --> 33:00.560]  It's all the counts. But as of late, friends eat what's on my plate. So I
[33:01.360 --> 33:06.920]  meet all I hear. Can I get you back next week? No. So give me that check,
[33:06.920 --> 33:11.280]  please. Everybody says I nickel and dime. I don't make it rain. That's like
[33:11.280 --> 33:16.240]  triple is fine. Oh, if I were a rich man, then I'd play a little fiddle on
[33:16.240 --> 33:21.760]  the roof. We raised the stakes. We forced the ante up. Bet your bottom
[33:21.760 --> 33:27.280]  dollar. I tore her panties up like I told the envelope to get your birthday
[33:27.280 --> 33:31.880]  card. Your granny. Keep your fanny talk underneath your long. See me
[33:31.880 --> 33:37.040]  waiting for you outside. You want to make a living. I want to make a killing.
[33:37.080 --> 33:38.640]  So put your hands to the sky.
[33:41.880 --> 33:42.320]  Bank.
[33:45.880 --> 33:46.160]  Each.
[33:48.960 --> 33:50.440]  It's all about the Benjamin's.
[33:51.960 --> 33:52.440]  I've seen
[33:54.760 --> 33:55.800]  don't make sense.
[33:58.080 --> 33:58.360]  Cash.
[34:01.560 --> 34:03.880]  Get your rupees. Get your shackles.
[34:06.880 --> 34:07.400]  Foreign.
[34:08.320 --> 34:10.600]  You know, partner partner with each other.
[34:12.160 --> 34:12.680]  Trade.
[34:14.160 --> 34:15.600]  You don't need a bank account.
[34:15.600 --> 34:41.810]  Yeah, welcome back. Cannabis community. It's time for episode number one.
[34:41.810 --> 34:45.530]  70th to grow from your heart podcast. Your source for cannabis news,
[34:45.570 --> 34:48.970]  education and conversation. That's right. If you're a new grower, if you're

[36:47.850 --> 36:50.410]  time. They're pretty cool. They're pretty cool. Like, and it's kind of
[36:50.410 --> 36:53.850]  weird to see a hoodie with my face on it, but people will be wearing them and
[36:53.850 --> 36:56.850]  I'll have to adjust. So big shout out to my hand, my friends at hand, big shot

[37:22.210 --> 37:26.290]  so sweet on a hoodie. Super, super high quality printing. Isn't that printing
[37:26.290 --> 37:29.770]  smooth? It looks like they put a sticker on a hoodie. Yeah. Yeah. That's so
[37:29.770 --> 37:34.290]  clean. Especially once it ages a little dope as fuck. Jesse said, well,
[37:34.290 --> 37:36.930]  Jesse's kind of into the punk rock thing. So once it fades and it doesn't
[37:36.930 --> 37:39.290]  look brand new, is that when you're going to like it? Yeah. But it doesn't
[37:39.290 --> 37:42.970]  look so fresh. All right. Yeah. I understand that. You gotta, gotta wear
[37:42.970 --> 37:46.810]  it. Gotta go spill some beer on it. Uh, let's see. What else did I want to make
[37:46.810 --> 37:49.690]  sure to mention? Something I thought about the other day on the podcast, and
[37:49.690 --> 37:54.010]  I'm sure that Jesse will, uh, will agree with what I'm going to say. There was
[37:54.010 --> 37:56.890]  another word I was trying to try to find, but I can't find the word you
[37:56.890 --> 38:02.330]  guys. I owe you a huge thank you for trusting me. You guys listen to me and I
[38:02.330 --> 38:05.710]  give you advice about your cannabis plants, which are used for your medicine
[38:05.710 --> 38:10.130]  to keep you healthy or in another way to keep your wallet fat. However, it's
[38:10.130 --> 38:14.090]  happening. I'm helping you out and you trust me with your financial and your
[38:14.090 --> 38:18.130]  medicinal investment and your time and your energy. You trust what I say. And
[38:18.130 --> 38:22.250]  that means a lot to me. So thank you for trusting me and thanks for, uh, for
[38:22.250 --> 38:25.170]  trusting me. Shit. That's it. Thanks for believing that my guidance is
[38:25.170 --> 38:28.330]  correct. And thanks for believing in me. Thanks for supporting the podcast.
[38:28.330 --> 38:30.370]  That's just cool as shit. I realized the other day that there are a lot of
[38:30.370 --> 38:33.730]  people out there that say, I have a question about cannabis, ask Ross to
[38:33.730 --> 38:37.650]  Jeff. So just thanks for believing in me and trusting me to guide you through
[38:37.650 --> 38:40.450]  your garden. All right. I think that's enough rambling for the start of the
[38:40.450 --> 38:45.450]  podcast. Uh, Jesse's here and he wanted to talk about composting. He sent me a
[38:45.450 --> 38:50.130]  message and he said, I have had composting on my head all day. And I said,
[38:50.130 --> 38:55.770]  I don't think compost is quite what's in your head, but it's close. So here we
[38:55.770 --> 39:00.010]  are. We're going to talk a little bit about composting. Um, yeah. Where do you
[39:00.010 --> 39:03.010]  want to start, bro? Do you want to jump right into it with anything? Um,
[39:03.570 --> 39:08.170]  hell, I don't even know where to start. Okay. Well, the first note that I took
[39:08.170 --> 39:16.330]  was Bokashi. Yeah. Yeah. So, okay. Let's do it that way. So Bokashi is for
[39:16.330 --> 39:22.330]  anyone that's not familiar. Um, it is a grain that has been inoculated with an
[39:22.370 --> 39:28.130]  EM one culture and endogenous microorganism. Yes. Yes. Um, do you know
[39:28.130 --> 39:33.490]  how that's done? Um, yeah, pretty much. I think they spray like a barley. So
[39:34.530 --> 39:39.970]  okay. With possibly a dairy product. Um, that's how you end up with the EM one
[39:40.490 --> 39:46.010]  fermented milk. Okay. So you take a culture, you collect and you mix it with
[39:46.010 --> 39:52.370]  milk and it, uh, it ferments and that's how you end up with what they call labs.
[39:52.810 --> 39:57.930]  Lactic acid bacteria. Correct. Okay. Um, and from that you can turn that into EM
[39:57.930 --> 40:03.770]  one and you can take the EM one, inoculate your grain, fermented again,
[40:04.050 --> 40:10.970]  um, let it dry out and boom, you've got Bokashi great. Okay. So are you making
[40:10.970 --> 40:15.490]  the Bokashi? Are you buying the Bokashi pre-made? Um, I'm getting the Bokashi
[40:15.530 --> 40:20.810]  right now from Victor, um, with innovative organics up in Denver. Okay.
[40:21.010 --> 40:28.530]  Um, it's really good and it's pretty damn cheap. So, and he's a small local
[40:28.530 --> 40:36.410]  business that is, um, that's taken food out of the, you know, landfills. Oh,
[40:36.410 --> 40:40.890]  cool. Very cool. So let's, well, let's teach the people about the Bokashi
[40:40.890 --> 40:43.570]  bucket a little bit then since you said taking food out of the landfills, that's
[40:43.570 --> 40:46.970]  going to make people have a lot of questions. Uh, I've got a Bokashi bucket.
[40:46.970 --> 40:50.650]  I can see one from where we're sitting, so it'll be advantageous to describe it.
[40:50.970 --> 40:55.130]  It's basically a five gallon bucket with a spigot on it. Uh, there's a little
[40:55.130 --> 40:59.290]  collection tray in the bottom that prevents the solid particles from getting
[40:59.290 --> 41:04.690]  in the way of the spigot. And basically I fill that thing with my vegetable
[41:04.690 --> 41:07.610]  scraps. I don't eat any meat products. So all my vegetable scraps, the tips of
[41:07.610 --> 41:11.610]  my carrots, uh, the ends of my avocados, the avocado pits go in there and they
[41:11.610 --> 41:15.770]  disintegrate completely. Stuff that, uh, goes to waste. Yeah. Anything I would
[41:15.770 --> 41:19.090]  throw away. It's sitting near the trash can to encourage me instead of putting
[41:19.090 --> 41:22.290]  it in the trash, it goes in the Bokashi bucket. I fill it up. Uh, I fill up a
[41:22.290 --> 41:26.210]  bowl, like a glass bowl. And then I dumped that glass bowl into the Bokashi
[41:26.210 --> 41:28.330]  bucket because it's much easier that way. And I don't have to open it as
[41:28.330 --> 41:32.930]  frequently because it smells like hell. Yeah. So you've got a five gallon bucket
[41:32.930 --> 41:37.770]  with a lid that seals on it. It's got a spigot. Um, I usually put a little layer,
[41:37.770 --> 41:41.130]  a thin layer of newspaper in there just to prevent. That's a good idea. Yeah.
[41:41.130 --> 41:46.050]  Cause some of that particle stuff will clog up the drain thing. So you put, uh,
[41:46.130 --> 41:48.810]  put the paper down and then you, I just put like a couple of banana peels,
[41:48.810 --> 41:51.090]  honestly, in there to get started. Cause I eat a shit ton of, I used to eat a
[41:51.090 --> 41:54.130]  shit ton of bananas, two banana peels in there to get it started. Then a handful
[41:54.130 --> 41:58.890]  of the Bokashi grain, because that is a bioactivator. And then you just start
[41:58.890 --> 42:02.210]  throwing your, all your scrap in there. And then once you get a nice layer, maybe
[42:02.210 --> 42:05.770]  an inch or two thick, then just put a little, another handful of that Bokashi
[42:05.770 --> 42:10.970]  grain on there and repeat, just make a lasagna basically of scraps, Kashi
[42:11.930 --> 42:16.450]  I think it's an inch and a half that they say to put in. Yeah. So every inch
[42:16.450 --> 42:20.370]  and a half throw in more Bokashi grain. And don't press it down you guys.
[42:20.370 --> 42:23.410]  Cause it's going to expand in there. No, you do want to press it. You do want
[42:23.410 --> 42:27.010]  to press it down. Get the air out. Squeeze all the oxygen. Okay. Yeah. All
[42:27.010 --> 42:31.770]  right. So, uh, most Bokashi buckets come with a little masher thing. Oh,
[42:31.770 --> 42:35.010]  it's when you push it down that it farts and makes that horrific smell. Yes.
[42:35.010 --> 42:40.210]  Correct. Okay. Yeah. Also you can squeeze a shit ton of, uh, of Chilean,
[42:40.810 --> 42:44.570]  the leachate juice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Have you ever tried to clean a drain
[42:44.570 --> 42:48.170]  with that juice? I actually just tried it the other day. Did it work for you?
[42:48.210 --> 42:52.690]  No, but it's pretty fucking clogged. Okay. All right. I poured, I even made
[42:52.690 --> 42:57.850]  sure I had enough. Um, I poured fuck like a half gallon in there. Oh wow.
[42:57.890 --> 43:00.170]  Yeah. That should have been quiet. If that's like a hair clog, that would have
[43:00.170 --> 43:04.890]  done it. You got something serious in there. What'd you eat boy? It's just a
[43:04.890 --> 43:09.430]  sink. All right. So you make your little lasagna, then you pack it down and then
[43:09.430 --> 43:13.470]  you seal it up and just leave it in there. And then after about 10 or 12
[43:13.470 --> 43:17.270]  days, it'll start making juice and you can open up the little spigot and I use
[43:17.270 --> 43:20.710]  a glass Mason jar to catch the juice and then I seal it up and then I cover it
[43:20.710 --> 43:23.510]  with honestly with just a rag to keep it dark because you want to keep that away
[43:23.510 --> 43:28.990]  from the light. Uh, and then I put about a an ounce per five gallon bucket. When
[43:28.990 --> 43:32.910]  I go to mix up some nutrients, put about an ounce of that crap in there and a
[43:32.910 --> 43:36.590]  five gallon bucket with my new tonight can see the plants start uptaking much
[43:36.590 --> 43:40.430]  better. And when I, I'll go ahead, it's just full of nutrients. It's all the
[43:40.430 --> 43:46.270]  nutrients from the plant. Right? I mean, it's just that's all I'm using now in
[43:46.270 --> 43:50.710]  micro. That's amazing. Even at the big growth, we started using it quite a bit
[43:51.150 --> 43:56.470]  and it will save on trash, save on nutrient money. It's full of humic acids,
[43:56.470 --> 44:03.470]  fulvic acids, lactic acids. Um, it's got bacteria and fungi in it. A lot of the
[44:03.470 --> 44:06.710]  things that you probably forgot about and that your bottle nutrient company
[44:06.710 --> 44:10.670]  probably missed also. Yeah. It'll speed up the root zone, speed up the
[44:10.670 --> 44:13.710]  metabolism of your plants. So this is just the Bokashi bucket. You can get
[44:13.710 --> 44:17.270]  that lactic acid bacteria juice out of there. So it'll start growing this white
[44:17.270 --> 44:23.150]  funky foam, these big gross looking brainy bubbles. That is perfect. You want
[44:23.150 --> 44:27.470]  that. If that's happening, you did it perfectly. Keep that going because once
[44:27.470 --> 44:30.630]  you've drained it a few times, I mean you can drain it a lot of times. You can
[44:30.630 --> 44:33.550]  leave it going and keep draining it and mash it and drain it and mash it. It'll
[44:33.550 --> 44:38.150]  go for a long time. But eventually what I like to do after I've harvested, I'll
[44:38.150 --> 44:42.990]  take my old dirt and pour it into a big, uh, like a, a big R it's like a feed
[44:42.990 --> 44:46.710]  trough for horses. I think for all the dirt into there, then I'll pour that
[44:46.710 --> 44:51.430]  Bokashi bucket into there, all that funk and mix it in and mix that in with my
[44:51.430 --> 44:54.670]  dirt and cover it and put a little moisture in there and then it spreads.
[44:54.950 --> 44:58.830]  And I feel like that stuff, the, whatever I made in the Kashi bucket grows
[44:58.830 --> 45:02.870]  throughout my soil at that point. I just go stir it occasionally and then I'll
[45:02.870 --> 45:06.910]  try to do it. I'll try to get two full Bokashi buckets in there by the, before
[45:06.910 --> 45:08.510]  I go start to reuse it. Yeah.
[45:09.110 --> 45:11.070]  Man, the smell is intense.
[45:12.470 --> 45:17.390]  It kind of smells like somebody threw up in the bar trash can after drinking all
[45:17.390 --> 45:17.630]  day.
[45:17.750 --> 45:19.070]  Yeah. That's a good way to describe it.
[45:19.070 --> 45:20.470]  It's sort of rotten milk.
[45:22.950 --> 45:26.510]  So they ate ice cream and then drank all day and then threw up in the bar trash
[45:26.510 --> 45:26.750]  can.
[45:27.390 --> 45:29.990]  No, that's what it, that's seriously, it's bad.
[45:30.230 --> 45:32.270]  You can just bring a little, Mike can't be around it.
[45:32.590 --> 45:34.430]  A white Mike that's on the podcast often.
[45:34.430 --> 45:36.670]  He can't, he's like, Oh, if you're going to do that, I'm fucking going home.
[45:36.710 --> 45:38.270]  Like he won't even be here.
[45:38.430 --> 45:40.070]  The guys at work love it.
[45:40.070 --> 45:44.030]  When I, uh, when I fill a res with it, yummy, yummy.
[45:44.030 --> 45:46.430]  I've seen, uh, the Bokashi people on Instagram.
[45:46.430 --> 45:48.390]  Actually, there's actually a company called Bokashi.
[45:48.790 --> 45:53.590]  They use 55 gallon drums of the mixture and then they use a forklift to lift it
[45:53.590 --> 45:54.270]  up and dump it.
[45:54.790 --> 45:57.350]  And I can just imagine what that smells like.
[45:57.350 --> 45:59.790]  Just 55 gallons of dead body.
[46:00.070 --> 46:04.550]  Victor's doing the same thing with the innovative organics.
[46:04.590 --> 46:04.990]  Okay.
[46:05.030 --> 46:05.350]  Yeah.
[46:06.310 --> 46:08.670]  Um, fuck, what was I going to say?
[46:09.310 --> 46:11.750]  Oh, when you were talking about putting a lot of banana pills in there.
[46:12.110 --> 46:18.670]  So cool thing about, Oh, or doing this process is the compost that the Bokashi
[46:18.670 --> 46:21.030]  will eventually make the pulp itself.
[46:21.550 --> 46:27.590]  Um, and the leachate from it are both, they contain the nutrients
[46:27.590 --> 46:28.710]  that the plants contained.
[46:29.150 --> 46:34.070]  Um, and bananas for instance, are super high in potassium.
[46:34.870 --> 46:41.550]  Um, so if you want a custom tuned Bokashi juice, I mean, you know, look at
[46:41.550 --> 46:42.950]  the nutrients that are in the plant.
[46:43.110 --> 46:47.910]  If you filled that thing with, uh, um, with bananas and banana pills, I
[46:47.950 --> 46:50.710]  guarantee you'd be high in fuck guaranteed case.
[46:50.990 --> 46:51.270]  Yep.
[46:51.510 --> 46:51.790]  Yeah.
[46:51.910 --> 46:55.790]  If you put, uh, berries that are darker in colors, we're going to have a whole
[46:55.790 --> 46:57.430]  bunch of like humics and stuff like that.
[46:57.430 --> 46:58.950]  And then I assume, yeah.
[46:59.790 --> 47:00.150]  Okay.
[47:00.390 --> 47:01.750]  So you've got your Bokashi bucket.
[47:02.110 --> 47:04.590]  You got this whole fuzzy white mess of stuff.
[47:04.590 --> 47:07.190]  You've got jars of lactic acid bacteria.
[47:07.670 --> 47:11.510]  Uh, then you said your next thing that you got going was your worm program.
[47:11.550 --> 47:12.830]  Let's talk about your worms.
[47:13.190 --> 47:17.390]  So I started with a hundred worms, uh, back in the summer.
[47:17.590 --> 47:22.750]  Um, uh, potential vendor, um, brought them in and just gave them to me.
[47:22.750 --> 47:24.350]  And I was like, nice, nice.
[47:25.590 --> 47:26.510]  Red wigglers.
[47:26.550 --> 47:26.830]  Yeah.
[47:26.830 --> 47:28.110]  Just red, red wigglers.
[47:28.110 --> 47:29.070]  It was a hundred of them.
[47:29.190 --> 47:32.750]  And like, you know, like, uh, yeah, exactly.
[47:32.790 --> 47:33.110]  All right.
[47:33.230 --> 47:38.390]  Um, so I took it home and dumped them in a smart pot full of, uh, food scraps.
[47:38.390 --> 47:38.950]  Initially.
[47:39.430 --> 47:42.630]  Um, I put it just straight peat moss in there.
[47:43.150 --> 47:44.470]  Um, cause that's something they eat.
[47:44.550 --> 47:49.870]  Um, and I also did, I think some newspaper then, and I
[47:49.870 --> 47:50.990]  kept them through the summer.
[47:51.110 --> 47:55.190]  Um, I wasn't like real actively feeding them or anything, but
[47:55.550 --> 47:56.990]  now that winter's came around.
[47:57.550 --> 48:04.350]  Um, I took, I think it's a 40 gallon container and filled it with all the
[48:04.350 --> 48:09.190]  worm or, uh, you know, all the stuff necessary for a good proper setup of
[48:09.310 --> 48:10.030]  worm bedding.
[48:10.590 --> 48:15.790]  And I've been dumping the, uh, uh, Bokashi pulp in there and they go
[48:15.790 --> 48:21.270]  fucking nuts for that shit, but I've got, so, I mean, I'm just, it's, it's
[48:21.270 --> 48:23.830]  cool as fuck, I'm making all my nutrients at home, basically.
[48:24.110 --> 48:27.270]  We, we toss a little bit about what's in your worm bedding.
[48:27.830 --> 48:28.190]  Yeah.
[48:28.190 --> 48:34.030]  So I use, I got some used phone books or, well, I think all phone books are used.
[48:34.030 --> 48:35.710]  I don't even know why the fuck they still make them.
[48:35.710 --> 48:36.230]  That's true.
[48:36.510 --> 48:37.550]  Just a waste of trees.
[48:37.590 --> 48:37.990]  Yeah.
[48:38.070 --> 48:38.710]  It's worm food.
[48:38.910 --> 48:41.910]  I shredded them up and a bunch of newspapers.
[48:42.590 --> 48:45.550]  Um, I used wood chips.
[48:46.670 --> 48:50.230]  Um, I have a comfrey plant at home, so that's indoors.
[48:50.230 --> 48:51.710]  So I went ahead and chopped all of that.
[48:51.910 --> 48:52.230]  Okay.
[48:52.230 --> 48:55.430]  Like, uh, so they're going to turn that up for you and turn that into usable
[48:55.430 --> 49:00.910]  nutrients, which that's a whole nother, um, part of my little homestead style
[49:00.910 --> 49:03.030]  growing the comfrey that is.
[49:03.590 --> 49:10.470]  Um, but, uh, I put some of that in there and then, uh, a full bucket of Bokashi
[49:10.470 --> 49:10.990]  stuff.
[49:11.070 --> 49:11.510]  Wow.
[49:11.550 --> 49:12.510]  They're going to love all that.
[49:12.830 --> 49:16.590]  And I figured out, uh, so the Bokashi stinks like hell when it's in a open
[49:16.590 --> 49:17.110]  worm bin.
[49:17.150 --> 49:17.670]  Yes.
[49:17.750 --> 49:24.030]  Um, so this time I put a whole bunch of, uh, wood, a thick layer of wood chips
[49:24.030 --> 49:27.710]  on the top and then a bunch of wet newspaper to seal it all up.
[49:27.710 --> 49:28.510]  Kind of trap it in there.
[49:28.590 --> 49:31.110]  And the smell went, I can't even smell it.
[49:31.190 --> 49:31.550]  Okay.
[49:31.710 --> 49:32.310]  That's helpful.
[49:32.470 --> 49:32.750]  Yeah.
[49:33.030 --> 49:34.390]  In the winter like this, it's cold.
[49:34.390 --> 49:37.350]  You guys, it's probably 12 degrees here in Colorado, maybe lower.
[49:37.350 --> 49:38.910]  I'm I don't want to go find out.
[49:39.110 --> 49:39.430]  Yeah.
[49:39.470 --> 49:41.990]  It's been hanging around like 15, 20 degrees.
[49:41.990 --> 49:42.390]  Easy.
[49:42.710 --> 49:43.030]  Tonight.
[49:43.030 --> 49:44.230]  It's going to get stupid cold.
[49:44.670 --> 49:46.910]  Uh, in my garage, I'm guessing it's going to be in the teens.
[49:47.150 --> 49:51.790]  Would I be able to keep my 40 gallon worm life container in the garage right now?
[49:52.190 --> 49:55.510]  Um, you know, I don't really know.
[49:55.710 --> 49:56.030]  Okay.
[49:56.150 --> 49:59.870]  Um, I have a similar situation, but my garage is heated.
[50:00.070 --> 50:00.350]  All right.
[50:01.310 --> 50:07.230]  Um, it's around 65 degrees and they don't give it like, I would assume that that
[50:07.230 --> 50:12.070]  dirt is going to be hot anyway, because it's bioactive and that's like the, the
[50:12.070 --> 50:14.750]  little warm farm I have most definitely.
[50:15.150 --> 50:16.750]  It creates its own heat.
[50:16.910 --> 50:18.110]  It's more established.
[50:18.510 --> 50:24.950]  Uh, the big one, I just set that up, um, last weekend, so I'm sure it will start
[50:24.950 --> 50:30.110]  heating up, but I'm not going to like just say, Oh yeah, you'll be fine.
[50:30.110 --> 50:33.550]  So one thing I would for sure do is lift it off the floor.
[50:34.110 --> 50:34.390]  Okay.
[50:34.430 --> 50:35.070]  So that's
[50:35.470 --> 50:36.110]  off that cold.
[50:36.150 --> 50:40.550]  Your plans want to be off that cold concrete really sucks for plants unless
[50:40.550 --> 50:42.390]  it's a real fancy heated floor.
[50:42.550 --> 50:42.830]  Right.
[50:43.310 --> 50:44.230]  It gets so cold.
[50:44.270 --> 50:44.470]  Yeah.
[50:44.510 --> 50:44.990]  So cold.
[50:44.990 --> 50:45.510]  So fast.
[50:45.510 --> 50:46.270]  It's a heat sink.
[50:46.270 --> 50:50.590]  It actually steals heat out of things that are sitting on it.
[50:50.830 --> 50:51.190]  So.
[50:51.670 --> 50:52.150]  Oh, wow.
[50:52.190 --> 50:52.950]  I never thought of that.
[50:53.110 --> 50:53.350]  Yeah.
[50:53.990 --> 50:55.830]  Well, like when you're drunk and you lay in the bathtub to cool down.
[50:56.110 --> 50:56.310]  Yeah.
[50:57.390 --> 50:59.990]  I haven't done that shit in so long, but that was the first, first thing
[50:59.990 --> 51:00.590]  I could think of.
[51:01.550 --> 51:01.870]  Wow.
[51:01.910 --> 51:02.230]  Okay.
[51:02.310 --> 51:03.230]  I remember those days.
[51:03.550 --> 51:03.830]  All right.
[51:03.830 --> 51:05.990]  So you've got your book, Kashi, you got your worms and you're using
[51:06.030 --> 51:07.510]  a big 40 gallon container.
[51:08.030 --> 51:10.310]  Uh, how, what else he is going into your compost?
[51:10.630 --> 51:12.950]  Um, just kitchen scraps at this point.
[51:13.270 --> 51:16.910]  Um, once spring comes around and it's not cold as fuck.
[51:17.390 --> 51:22.030]  Uh, when I get my outdoor compost pile going, I'll be putting all the
[51:22.790 --> 51:23.870]  chicken bedding in there.
[51:24.430 --> 51:26.830]  Um, that's mixed with chicken shit.
[51:27.030 --> 51:27.390]  Okay.
[51:27.630 --> 51:30.070]  Um, and you put like meat products in there also?
[51:30.470 --> 51:31.150]  No.
[51:31.270 --> 51:36.710]  Um, it, I mean, you can in Bocashi, but, or they say you can.
[51:36.870 --> 51:40.670]  I actually saw somebody, the Bocashi people put their entire Thanksgiving
[51:40.710 --> 51:45.110]  dinner, their Turkey, like the carcass of the uneaten Turkey, the mashed
[51:45.110 --> 51:47.870]  potatoes, they put the entire thing in there and then they showed the process.
[51:47.870 --> 51:51.150]  They, and then they took a, the thing outside and dug a hole and buried it.
[51:51.550 --> 51:53.550]  And then they planted a tree on top of where they buried it.
[51:53.550 --> 51:54.750]  So that's how they did it.
[51:54.750 --> 51:56.710]  But they had, they explained they could put meat in there as well.
[51:56.750 --> 51:57.750]  It just took a little longer.
[51:57.990 --> 51:59.590]  They even say put feces in there.
[51:59.790 --> 52:03.510]  Um, things I'm not brave enough to do and things I'm not going
[52:03.510 --> 52:05.230]  to do for my indoor garden.
[52:05.350 --> 52:05.670]  Right.
[52:05.750 --> 52:11.230]  Um, if I had a big, huge, gigantic outdoor garden, that would be
[52:11.230 --> 52:12.430]  a end of the world scenario.
[52:12.630 --> 52:13.070]  Oh yeah.
[52:13.070 --> 52:13.350]  Yeah.
[52:13.350 --> 52:13.470]  Yeah.
[52:13.590 --> 52:17.630]  Um, even dairy, uh, cheese and stuff like that.
[52:17.630 --> 52:19.430]  They say you can do put eggshells in there too.
[52:19.430 --> 52:19.830]  Oh yeah.
[52:19.830 --> 52:21.710]  I told him I totally put eggshells in there.
[52:21.790 --> 52:22.070]  Yeah.
[52:22.270 --> 52:23.190]  Coffee grounds.
[52:23.510 --> 52:25.430]  Um, even paper.
[52:25.510 --> 52:29.510]  I mean, it's like coffee filters, newspapers, stuff like that.
[52:29.630 --> 52:31.110]  So, oh yeah.
[52:31.110 --> 52:32.110]  It just eats that right up.
[52:32.470 --> 52:33.870]  That stuff just disappears.
[52:33.910 --> 52:34.190]  Yeah.
[52:34.230 --> 52:39.390]  You don't get a lot of leachate off of it, but, um, also I've been putting
[52:39.390 --> 52:41.630]  a, all my cannabis scraps in them.
[52:41.950 --> 52:48.150]  So I've been, um, when you run them through, if I was to throw like the
[52:48.150 --> 52:52.790]  leaves and stuff off my plants in the garden into the open warm bin, I
[52:52.790 --> 52:54.750]  would lose most of the nitrogen.
[52:55.430 --> 52:58.990]  Um, and fuck what else?
[52:58.990 --> 53:04.710]  And I would lose carbon through the CO2 that it emits as it dries up and breaks
[53:04.710 --> 53:09.270]  down, running them through the Bokashi bucket, you retain all of that.
[53:09.510 --> 53:09.910]  Wow.
[53:09.910 --> 53:10.150]  Okay.
[53:10.150 --> 53:12.990]  Cause it ferments it first and it traps it in the plant.
[53:13.470 --> 53:16.870]  So then it's, it's healthier food for the worms and it makes a
[53:16.910 --> 53:18.510]  higher quality product.
[53:18.510 --> 53:20.230]  It's just richer, much richer.
[53:20.270 --> 53:20.590]  Okay.
[53:21.230 --> 53:23.870]  That fermentation is what gives it that amazing smell.
[53:23.950 --> 53:24.230]  Yeah.
[53:24.470 --> 53:29.350]  That's Victor's been teaching me about the wonders of Bokashi.
[53:29.390 --> 53:30.230]  Shout out to Victor.
[53:30.230 --> 53:31.910]  It seems like he knows what he's talking about.
[53:31.950 --> 53:35.310]  Um, he, uh, we totally get them on the show on these days.
[53:35.350 --> 53:37.110]  Victor, you're invited to be on the phone.
[53:37.510 --> 53:37.830]  Okay.
[53:38.110 --> 53:39.790]  We can, I can, I've got a zoom age six.
[53:39.790 --> 53:40.710]  We'll go to wherever he is.
[53:40.750 --> 53:41.110]  Nice.
[53:41.190 --> 53:41.430]  Yeah.
[53:41.470 --> 53:42.270]  If he's in Colorado.
[53:42.390 --> 53:42.630]  Yeah.
[53:42.670 --> 53:42.950]  Oh yeah.
[53:42.950 --> 53:43.750]  He's up in Denver.
[53:43.950 --> 53:44.150]  Oh yeah.
[53:44.150 --> 53:44.710]  We'll go to Denver.
[53:44.710 --> 53:45.230]  And we'll see what's up.
[53:45.230 --> 53:48.870]  He's got a huge warehouse full of fucking Bokashi buckets.
[53:48.910 --> 53:49.910]  We'll just go sit on a bucket.
[53:49.910 --> 53:51.510]  We'll all get a Bokashi bucket as a chair.
[53:51.710 --> 53:52.230]  That's funky.
[53:54.230 --> 53:56.950]  When you're a ganja grower, it smells kind of funky.
[53:57.190 --> 54:01.270]  Sometimes is it a sickeningly satisfying thing?
[54:01.470 --> 54:02.910]  Like that smells terrible.
[54:02.950 --> 54:04.230]  I'll take five gallons of it.
[54:06.670 --> 54:11.070]  You know that that's going to make it like fish hydro slates and like Bokashi
[54:11.070 --> 54:15.070]  juice and remember Nirvana and piranha or what was it?
[54:15.110 --> 54:18.430]  Uh, piranha and tarantula from advanced nutrients when they made the liquids.
[54:18.470 --> 54:18.710]  Yeah.
[54:18.710 --> 54:21.630]  Those things smelled like the women's bathroom at the park in the middle of
[54:21.630 --> 54:22.110]  the summer.
[54:22.350 --> 54:23.550]  It was so terrible.
[54:24.190 --> 54:24.790]  They worked.
[54:24.910 --> 54:27.350]  You could feed your plants very little of those things and your
[54:27.350 --> 54:28.470]  plants would just go ape shit.
[54:28.670 --> 54:29.470]  I never used them.
[54:29.950 --> 54:30.110]  Yeah.
[54:30.110 --> 54:33.470]  I I'll admit it back in the day I used all of the advanced nutrients product.
[54:33.470 --> 54:34.310]  I didn't know any better.
[54:34.510 --> 54:35.790]  It's one I've never tried.
[54:36.190 --> 54:37.550]  I just, yeah.
[54:38.030 --> 54:41.030]  Not, not to bash anything, but that's one that I would avoid.
[54:41.150 --> 54:42.190]  Uh, it did.
[54:42.510 --> 54:45.870]  They promise you that you'll get 30% heavier yields, which it did.
[54:45.870 --> 54:50.110]  They gave me probably 30% fatter yields than any other brand I've ever used, but
[54:50.510 --> 54:54.830]  all of my different strains looked, smelled and tasted the exact same.
[54:55.390 --> 55:01.270]  And they were all about, I hypothetically, if all those strains hit 30% THC with my
[55:01.270 --> 55:05.670]  regular regimen, they all hit about 2025 when I used advanced nutrients, but they
[55:05.670 --> 55:06.310]  were heavier.
[55:06.630 --> 55:07.870]  There was a lot more of it.
[55:07.870 --> 55:08.470]  It just wasn't.
[55:08.470 --> 55:13.470]  And I'd rather have, I'd rather grow a pound and a half of super dank than two
[55:13.470 --> 55:14.790]  pounds of me.
[55:15.950 --> 55:18.630]  They are, um, extremely overpriced.
[55:18.710 --> 55:23.510]  And I can tell you that working with them as a vendor and a company, they are
[55:23.790 --> 55:24.750]  fucking nightmare.
[55:24.870 --> 55:28.750]  Every hydro shop that I've tried to mess with has said that because I would be
[55:28.750 --> 55:30.950]  like, Hey, can you order this new advanced nutrients product?
[55:30.950 --> 55:33.550]  And people just shake their heads and be like, Nope, I'll take what they send me.
[55:33.630 --> 55:34.830]  They send me boxes of shit.
[55:34.830 --> 55:35.790]  I sell that stuff.
[55:35.910 --> 55:36.710]  There's no asking.
[55:37.310 --> 55:37.670]  Oh yeah.
[55:37.870 --> 55:39.150]  You replaced them with psycho, right?
[55:39.630 --> 55:39.870]  Yeah.
[55:40.670 --> 55:43.150]  Uh, I did a side by I've done a lot of side by sides.
[55:43.230 --> 55:45.030]  This show just got off on a way side track.
[55:45.350 --> 55:46.990]  I did not prefer psycho either.
[55:47.390 --> 55:49.350]  A psycho gave me a lot of great colors.
[55:49.390 --> 55:52.670]  It gave me bud density and it gave me weight, but I did not approve of the
[55:52.670 --> 55:53.110]  flavor.
[55:53.150 --> 55:54.430]  The flavor was where it was lacking.
[55:54.430 --> 55:55.990]  Everything tasted like grape Kool-Aid.
[55:56.390 --> 56:02.070]  That seems to be how, um, how all those multi-part lines, right?
[56:02.350 --> 56:07.230]  If the bottles look like clear with different dyes in them, it's all probably
[56:07.230 --> 56:08.750]  in my opinion, I don't know this for sure.
[56:08.750 --> 56:09.590]  I should research this.
[56:09.590 --> 56:12.790]  They probably all came from one factory and they just get poured into different
[56:12.790 --> 56:14.270]  bottles and get different names put on them.
[56:14.790 --> 56:16.110]  Something or something similar.
[56:16.630 --> 56:21.830]  I, um, as a rule of thumb, when you're, this is just my opinion, but as a rule
[56:21.830 --> 56:25.630]  of thumb, when you're shopping for a nutrient line, try to stick with an
[56:25.630 --> 56:26.670]  American made nutrient.
[56:27.030 --> 56:27.350]  Yeah.
[56:27.750 --> 56:35.950]  Those are by far the best quality, um, avoid Dutch nutrients, uh, Dutch growers
[56:36.790 --> 56:41.030]  grow a completely different way than most Americans and the nutrients are
[56:41.030 --> 56:42.710]  formulated differently.
[56:43.270 --> 56:47.070]  And they don't really work well with the way most American growers grow.
[56:47.510 --> 56:48.670]  I agree with most of that.
[56:49.070 --> 56:52.550]  Uh, I have seen some great results though with a couple of those Dutch brands,
[56:52.550 --> 56:55.630]  but, uh, Mills, if you follow them, Oh, Mills is Dutch.
[56:56.190 --> 56:56.670]  Okay.
[56:56.710 --> 56:57.670]  So now, okay.
[56:57.670 --> 56:59.910]  Then I can think of three brands that I would almost buy their
[56:59.910 --> 57:01.270]  products if it came down to it.
[57:01.270 --> 57:03.390]  There's, I mean, housing garden is Canada.
[57:03.830 --> 57:04.430]  Oh yeah.
[57:04.430 --> 57:07.310]  Canada is such a great product.
[57:07.470 --> 57:09.190]  And, uh, playground.
[57:09.990 --> 57:12.430]  I've that's an old ass company.
[57:12.470 --> 57:12.710]  Yeah.
[57:12.710 --> 57:13.830]  That's some good shit though.
[57:13.830 --> 57:16.350]  From back in the day, a few people that are diehard.
[57:16.750 --> 57:17.550]  We can get that.
[57:17.590 --> 57:17.870]  Yeah.
[57:17.950 --> 57:19.750]  We order it for a couple of guys.
[57:19.750 --> 57:20.070]  Okay.
[57:20.310 --> 57:23.910]  But you're right though, about, I've, I've got a note somewhere that says to
[57:23.910 --> 57:28.710]  talk about Dutch, uh, the Dutch bred cannabis to be a pussy, like, because
[57:28.710 --> 57:34.030]  their grow rooms, like the way I see it, cannabis happens on a Rocky mountain in
[57:34.030 --> 57:36.110]  Afghanistan where a goat pissed on it.
[57:36.550 --> 57:37.910]  The wind beat the shit out of it.
[57:37.910 --> 57:39.550]  The sun beat down on it.
[57:40.070 --> 57:41.870]  There's a likelihood that a rock fell on it.
[57:42.030 --> 57:42.430]  You know what I mean?
[57:42.430 --> 57:46.070]  On the, on the side of the Cush mountains in Afghanistan, a lot of shit.
[57:46.550 --> 57:46.830]  Yeah.
[57:46.830 --> 57:47.070]  Yeah.
[57:47.070 --> 57:48.150]  Still super cropping.
[57:48.150 --> 57:48.270]  Yeah.
[57:48.270 --> 57:49.870]  Actually a rabbit lives under it.
[57:50.110 --> 57:51.550]  Like it's covered in bugs.
[57:51.550 --> 57:52.270]  Shit goes wrong.
[57:52.750 --> 57:55.230]  Uh, I don't remember what the fuck my rant was all about now.
[57:55.470 --> 57:56.190]  Uh, Dutch.
[57:56.310 --> 57:56.670]  There we go.
[57:56.670 --> 57:56.950]  There we go.
[57:56.950 --> 57:57.310]  Thank you.
[57:57.310 --> 57:58.070]  So I had a brain injury.
[57:58.070 --> 57:59.350]  You guys, sometimes I freak out the fuck I'm saying.
[57:59.710 --> 58:02.830]  Uh, but so then the Dutch, uh, the Dutch got ahold of these plants and like,
[58:02.830 --> 58:03.910]  we want to grow them indoors.
[58:03.910 --> 58:06.790]  I have no idea what a fucking Dutch accent would sound like if I tried to do it.
[58:07.030 --> 58:09.190]  So like we want to grow these indoors and they wanted to find the best shit.
[58:09.190 --> 58:12.950]  They bred it to be these really skinny sticks that grow really perfect buds.
[58:13.270 --> 58:14.390]  And now it's like roses.
[58:14.390 --> 58:15.150]  It's like tulips.
[58:15.550 --> 58:20.070]  And I think that's Dutch is all about the flower industry.
[58:20.070 --> 58:21.030]  So they, they grow.
[58:21.030 --> 58:21.710]  Exactly.
[58:22.030 --> 58:26.110]  And over here in Colorado, California, the States that are catching on, we want
[58:26.110 --> 58:28.190]  to grow dank, robust plants.
[58:28.190 --> 58:29.710]  We understand about full plant health.
[58:29.710 --> 58:33.510]  We're breeding for complete plant structure, not just tulips.
[58:33.710 --> 58:39.870]  With, uh, most of the time I can pick out a Dutch strain or genetics from Dutch or
[58:39.870 --> 58:41.910]  from Dutch, from Amsterdam.
[58:42.350 --> 58:48.870]  Um, with, I mean, roll a joint and smoke it, you know, put two or roll three
[58:48.870 --> 58:52.390]  joints, put two American strains in one from Amsterdam in there.
[58:52.750 --> 58:59.230]  And I guarantee you'll be able to pick out the whitewashed, uh, just completely
[58:59.430 --> 59:01.790]  blended, everything tastes the same.
[59:01.830 --> 59:03.030]  Berries and flowers.
[59:03.270 --> 59:04.350]  No bud structure.
[59:05.190 --> 59:05.630]  Okay.
[59:06.030 --> 59:10.710]  I don't want to go bash every Dutch seed company, but I mean, yeah, man, I'm just
[59:10.710 --> 59:11.510]  hitting guys hard.
[59:11.790 --> 59:12.750]  Also avoid.
[59:15.470 --> 59:16.510]  And don't shop here either.
[59:17.790 --> 59:18.830]  And then ban this website.
[59:19.630 --> 59:19.790]  All right.
[59:19.790 --> 59:22.830]  But yes, I think the Dutch have kind of wheat and you know, some American breeders
[59:22.830 --> 59:25.310]  are probably susceptible and guilty of it also.
[59:25.550 --> 59:30.030]  Oh, they probably bred because we wanted to find back in the day, we didn't have a
[59:30.030 --> 59:31.550]  high pressure sodium lamp or an led.
[59:31.550 --> 59:35.950]  We probably were using whatever finagle lamp we can put together in the garage to
[59:35.950 --> 59:39.870]  make some space to try to create a 12, 12 flower cycle out of the few seeds that we
[59:39.870 --> 59:41.550]  did get from whatever we, we got that.
[59:41.550 --> 59:44.910]  We didn't know where it came from, but some dude told us was tie stick, but it was
[59:44.910 --> 59:47.990]  probably from Mexico, but we thought it was cool to tell our friends it was
[59:47.990 --> 59:48.550]  Jamaican.
[59:48.790 --> 59:49.390]  So you know what I mean?
[59:49.390 --> 59:53.550]  Like, yeah, you're growing these fucking maybe tie stick, maybe Columbia, maybe
[59:53.550 --> 59:58.030]  Jamaican seeds that could be males could be females could be who knows what it is.
[59:58.110 --> 59:59.670]  And they got to figure out how to grow that.
[59:59.950 --> 01:00:03.070]  So we may have gotten rid of the good shit back in the day because we didn't have the
[01:00:03.070 --> 01:00:03.670]  right lights.
[01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:05.030]  We didn't have the right knowledge.
[01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:08.310]  We just wanted something that finished quick and didn't climb up into the lights.
[01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:12.750]  I grew for three years before I ever saw a clone or even made one.
[01:00:12.790 --> 01:00:13.950]  So you just did a bunch of seeds.
[01:00:13.950 --> 01:00:14.310]  Yeah.
[01:00:14.350 --> 01:00:14.870]  Wow.
[01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:16.470]  I would kill to have some of that shit.
[01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:17.670]  I grew back.
[01:00:17.710 --> 01:00:18.230]  Oh yeah.
[01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:22.430]  I thought about how many, uh, I used to buy Mexican swag weed back in the day where I
[01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:22.710]  live.
[01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:25.390]  Mexican swag weed was four 50, $500 a pound.
[01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:26.230]  It was everywhere.
[01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:28.470]  And you could get a half ounce of seeds out of it.
[01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:30.550]  It looked like good, healthy, viable seeds.
[01:00:31.110 --> 01:00:34.870]  I almost wonder what I would have gotten from them because you know, those Mexican
[01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:37.510]  crops were producing a low yielding strain.
[01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:40.710]  Um, remember the lime green Christmas bud?
[01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:41.390]  Yes.
[01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:42.470]  I grew out some seeds.
[01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:43.470]  How did that come out?
[01:00:43.590 --> 01:00:44.790]  It was lime green Christmas.
[01:00:45.310 --> 01:00:49.030]  So it was just, uh, I guarantee that it was like touch genetics.
[01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:50.030]  Here we go again.
[01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:51.510]  Some Dutch auto flowers.
[01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:52.710]  It's something like that.
[01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:54.950]  I mean, it was just, it was all right.
[01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:58.990]  You know, 10 years ago would have went fucking head over heels for it.
[01:00:58.990 --> 01:00:59.190]  Yeah.
[01:00:59.190 --> 01:01:02.030]  It's funny that you call it Christmas, but because this town is known for getting
[01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:06.550]  the light green Christmas, but right around Christmas, that's amazing.
[01:01:06.670 --> 01:01:10.870]  Now that I know more about growing and everything, I guarantee that's probably
[01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:11.430]  auto flower.
[01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:12.550]  I used to get late season.
[01:01:12.550 --> 01:01:12.750]  Yeah.
[01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:14.630]  But the, there's a lot of.
[01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:19.230]  Uh, talk about the Mexican cartels using auto flower strains so that they can keep
[01:01:19.230 --> 01:01:20.390]  stuff going year round.
[01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:23.670]  And we talk about the one crop that was busted in the forest near us.
[01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:24.790]  That was all auto flowers.
[01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:25.510]  Yeah.
[01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:27.390]  That's so yeah, that's how they do that.
[01:01:29.070 --> 01:01:32.030]  They're, uh, they're those girls are cookie cutter.
[01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:33.990]  It's every single one of them is the same.
[01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:40.710]  Um, I mean, they're in different locations, but the way they grow, I mean,
[01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:44.710]  the, the cops, I can tell by looking at the pictures most of the time, uh, even
[01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:48.390]  the cops know, you know, the DEA, there's just a certain like fucking
[01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:49.830]  Billy and his crew were here again.
[01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:56.190]  So if you're ever going to bust out a big old grow that somewhere, uh, find out
[01:01:56.190 --> 01:01:57.710]  what that is and grow just like that.
[01:01:58.510 --> 01:02:02.270]  It's a Mexican food, like buy your food from the Mexican store with no English
[01:02:02.270 --> 01:02:05.030]  on the labels, uh, just store a bunch of it there.
[01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:06.630]  Cause I think that's what gives them the first hit.
[01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:09.190]  Like, Oh, it's a bunch of, what did they call them?
[01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:11.550]  Mexican nationals is what they labeled them as in the paper.
[01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:14.270]  So, and they're like, how do you know that we found tortillas?
[01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:15.710]  Good job.
[01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:20.150]  I used to get mad when I found seeds in my weed, like pay good money for kind,
[01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:21.070]  but there'd be seeds in it.
[01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:22.670]  Like motherfuckers, come on.
[01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:24.550]  I just paid, it's like a half a gram of seeds in here.
[01:02:24.550 --> 01:02:27.030]  And now I'm like, what happened to those seeds that threw out the window on fish
[01:02:27.030 --> 01:02:28.950]  tour? Like, I wish I had those.
[01:02:29.590 --> 01:02:35.110]  I, um, when I was out in California one time, the first time I, um, was exposed
[01:02:35.110 --> 01:02:39.310]  to the whole medical marijuana scene and everything kind of changed my life.
[01:02:39.310 --> 01:02:39.710]  Actually.
[01:02:40.030 --> 01:02:44.790]  Um, I spoke some OG Kush out there from my then co-founder,
[01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:50.190]  my then girlfriend's, uh, uh, cousin that was full of seeds.
[01:02:50.310 --> 01:02:55.430]  And I brought, brought him back even, and just over move, moving from, you know,
[01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:58.710]  over the years I, uh, lost them.
[01:02:58.950 --> 01:03:00.310]  So that's, yeah.
[01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:01.830]  You'll find them when the time is right.
[01:03:01.830 --> 01:03:02.270]  Hopefully.
[01:03:03.550 --> 01:03:07.630]  I just want you guys to talk about my first experience with medical marijuana,
[01:03:07.630 --> 01:03:09.630]  because I just, I've got a cool fucking story.
[01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:11.350]  I'm not going to tell it on this, but it's another podcast.
[01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:12.830]  I just thought about that.
[01:03:13.310 --> 01:03:16.070]  Um, I saw a 4k room.
[01:03:16.270 --> 01:03:17.270]  It was all lined out.
[01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:22.950]  All fucking now that I'm a more experienced grower, like total Cali style,
[01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:26.190]  fucking flood and drain table, rock pool slabs and everything.
[01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:26.990]  That's the way to do it.
[01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:28.070]  The fast track.
[01:03:28.550 --> 01:03:29.670]  It just blew my mind.
[01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:34.710]  It was like the, oh man, all these things I thought about that room then, like
[01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:39.630]  just how huge it was and how much money they must make and all that, how much
[01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:40.750]  work it was.
[01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:44.430]  Now I kind of chuckle, but yeah, that's four lights, huh?
[01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:44.790]  Okay.
[01:03:44.790 --> 01:03:45.110]  Totally.
[01:03:45.110 --> 01:03:48.310]  The first big fucking room I ever saw.
[01:03:48.310 --> 01:03:48.630]  Yeah.
[01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:53.750]  No, I, I, I try to now when we walk, I remember the first time that I walked
[01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:56.950]  into like a giant commercial grow, I had to like kind of bite my lip and try to
[01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:59.670]  keep my face straight instead of shit in my pants and getting a boner.
[01:04:00.070 --> 01:04:03.270]  And now when I walk into big grows, people still try to like the owner of a
[01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:06.150]  girl will walk in and they peek at you and they try to read your face.
[01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:08.670]  And I just try to keep that straight the whole time.
[01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:10.310]  Like, Oh, this is a cute bro.
[01:04:10.590 --> 01:04:15.070]  When sometimes I'm like, Oh my God, there's 500 lights in this one room.
[01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:19.190]  Like, yeah, that you guys don't take it for granted.
[01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:20.950]  Go check out some cool girls and appreciate it.
[01:04:21.110 --> 01:04:21.830]  We're we're jaded.
[01:04:21.830 --> 01:04:22.950]  Now we've been to too many places.
[01:04:23.310 --> 01:04:25.470]  We put too many hours in and too many facilities.
[01:04:25.470 --> 01:04:27.470]  I've been in more facilities than I care to admit.
[01:04:28.070 --> 01:04:30.350]  Been in half the facilities in this great state.
[01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:33.470]  All right, let's talk a little bit more about compost.
[01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:34.630]  We kind of got sidetracked.
[01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:37.070]  I want to ask a couple other questions also, but I want to keep on.
[01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:39.830]  I just wanted to ask you, what was one of your, what's your
[01:04:39.830 --> 01:04:40.910]  favorite shit to smoke?
[01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:42.830]  Because we're talking about seeds and I had a strain in mind
[01:04:42.830 --> 01:04:43.750]  that I wanted to ask you about.
[01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:45.110]  And I was like, I wonder if he'll mention that.
[01:04:45.110 --> 01:04:47.110]  Because it was a Pueblo favorite.
[01:04:47.110 --> 01:04:48.870]  What's one of your favorites to smoke?
[01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:50.150]  I think I know what you're talking about.
[01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:51.790]  You do. I'm sure you do.
[01:04:51.790 --> 01:04:53.110]  I haven't seen that shit.
[01:04:53.110 --> 01:04:54.990]  I've got seeds of it.
[01:04:54.990 --> 01:04:56.750]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:58.350]  What was that? Pee Bud.
[01:04:58.350 --> 01:05:00.030]  The P-91. P-91.
[01:05:00.030 --> 01:05:02.710]  That's right. Pee Bud's the Kim dog dude.
[01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:04.150]  Yeah.
[01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:06.990]  Yeah, I know that I remember getting that.
[01:05:09.830 --> 01:05:13.230]  But my favorite stuff to smoke nowadays is just like, oh, geez.
[01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:15.110]  Yetis.
[01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:17.510]  OK. OK. The P-91 was amazing.
[01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:19.670]  The OGs and the Yetis are great stuff to smoke.
[01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:26.230]  I bet the P-91 was related to like the deep chunk sweet tooth.
[01:05:26.270 --> 01:05:29.390]  It was Pit Bull and there's Bull Rider.
[01:05:30.310 --> 01:05:33.550]  And like Northern Lights 5, I think.
[01:05:34.110 --> 01:05:35.430]  Oh, I don't remember exactly.
[01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:36.390]  I could Google it if you want.
[01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:38.350]  That would make the strain I'm kind of thinking of.
[01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:40.870]  OK. Bull Riders and Afghani.
[01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:45.270]  Yep. And Northern Lights number five, I believe, is the Indica version.
[01:05:45.310 --> 01:05:47.310]  And I could be completely wrong by the Northern Lights.
[01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:50.310]  I know it's Bull Rider or Pit Bull, which is they're similar.
[01:05:50.790 --> 01:05:54.310]  And it's it's from Stony Girl Seeds is who actually put that one out
[01:05:54.310 --> 01:05:56.030]  and seed for him in the beginning.
[01:05:56.030 --> 01:05:58.990]  And then now there's another company, I think it was Gold Coast Genetics,
[01:05:58.990 --> 01:06:00.630]  maybe who I got the seeds from.
[01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:03.070]  I've got a 10 pack. They charge me way too much.
[01:06:03.070 --> 01:06:05.510]  But for the nostalgia, I was like, I need that shit.
[01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:07.150]  Yeah. I haven't. I've been real.
[01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:10.470]  I hold the seeds like they're precious and I want to pop them at the right time.
[01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:11.710]  For sure. All right.
[01:06:11.710 --> 01:06:12.990]  So I'm expecting company.
[01:06:12.990 --> 01:06:15.710]  Our good friend, Lindsey, the traveling stoner and Bobo are coming over.
[01:06:16.070 --> 01:06:19.270]  Bobo Blastrico's birthday was a few days ago and he got a sweet new rig
[01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:21.310]  from our friends, Rebel Glass. It's fucking dope.
[01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:22.670]  We're going to take some dabs out of that.
[01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:24.590]  We've got some time left. I just wanted to give you a warning.
[01:06:24.590 --> 01:06:28.190]  Let's talk about composting so that when they because I just told them to show up.
[01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:29.670]  So there's going to walk in eventually.
[01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:32.030]  And we may either hand them a microphone or we'll wrap up.
[01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:33.310]  We'll see how it goes.
[01:06:33.310 --> 01:06:34.750]  It's going to be very informal.
[01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:36.430]  Let's talk about composting until then.
[01:06:36.430 --> 01:06:39.550]  Sweet. So we go ahead. Fuck.
[01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:43.950]  I'm trying to remember where we are.
[01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:45.510]  We've got the worms.
[01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:46.910]  We've got the Bokashi.
[01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:49.150]  We're talking about getting it in a 40 gallon container.
[01:06:49.150 --> 01:06:51.750]  You've got your worms living in newspaper.
[01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:55.750]  You got ground, chopped up phone books, wood chunks, bark type stuff.
[01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:57.990]  I imagine. Comfrey. Comfrey.
[01:06:57.990 --> 01:07:00.830]  The Bokashi pulp. The Bokashi bucket pulp.
[01:07:02.590 --> 01:07:04.390]  And that's pretty.
[01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:07.150]  Oh, I threw in some oyster shell.
[01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:09.350]  OK, some malted barley seed.
[01:07:09.350 --> 01:07:11.350]  OK. Oyster shell just to
[01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:14.590]  give them some cow mag.
[01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:18.910]  And I was told by a worm keeping friend that oyster shell helps
[01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:20.590]  bulk the worms themselves up.
[01:07:20.590 --> 01:07:21.590]  That'll make them fatter.
[01:07:21.590 --> 01:07:23.950]  Yeah. Make them eat more and make them work a little harder.
[01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:25.870]  Yeah. OK. So and
[01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:29.870]  part of my plan with this big worm container
[01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:33.150]  is to release in my garden in the spring, early summer.
[01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:35.110]  So that.
[01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:40.190]  I'm just I'm building up the soil in my garden year after year after year.
[01:07:40.470 --> 01:07:44.150]  If I can dump, I mean, fuck, 10,000 worms or something like that,
[01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:46.230]  I might end up with shit. I don't even know.
[01:07:46.270 --> 01:07:47.030]  That'd be amazing.
[01:07:47.030 --> 01:07:49.510]  They just turn that soil all day long. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:07:49.550 --> 01:07:52.070]  And then you and your dad go fishing.
[01:07:52.070 --> 01:07:54.310]  Yeah, but I don't use worms.
[01:07:54.310 --> 01:07:55.590]  OK. Fly fisherman.
[01:07:55.590 --> 01:07:57.830]  OK. Purist. You don't want to just go sit there all day.
[01:07:57.950 --> 01:07:58.910]  You want to do something?
[01:07:58.910 --> 01:08:01.630]  Yeah. No, that's not really my type of fishing.
[01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:02.710]  I understand.
[01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:06.950]  So now we've got we've gotten dope ass compost now.
[01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:08.510]  Yeah. What do we do with that?
[01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:12.670]  Do we want to cut some of that 50 percent, 25 percent with regular soil?
[01:08:12.830 --> 01:08:15.230]  Let's let's act like we're going to put it into a potted plant
[01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:16.830]  to grow either indoors or outdoors.
[01:08:16.830 --> 01:08:18.990]  How much of that compost do you want to use?
[01:08:18.990 --> 01:08:24.030]  If you're building a soil from scratch, I would recommend like 30, 40 percent.
[01:08:24.270 --> 01:08:26.950]  OK. Compost.
[01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:28.390]  You don't have to use that much.
[01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:30.230]  It's just I mean, that's ideal.
[01:08:30.350 --> 01:08:31.510]  It's available. Yeah.
[01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:34.590]  Yeah. If you've got that, you know, you want to top dress that
[01:08:34.590 --> 01:08:36.350]  or do you want to blend it in when you start?
[01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:39.910]  If you're building the soil, I would totally recommend blending it.
[01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:43.910]  If you are top dressing, I would do.
[01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:47.910]  I want to say like a quarter cup per gallon container.
[01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:53.310]  Oh, OK. So if you got a seven gallon, I would recommend three and a half cups.
[01:08:53.750 --> 01:08:55.550]  Yeah. Yeah. That sounds about right.
[01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:56.910]  You did the odd number to yourself.
[01:08:56.910 --> 01:08:58.470]  I saw you. I'm trying to think of what I do.
[01:08:59.070 --> 01:09:01.270]  Yeah. What I tell the guys at work.
[01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:06.950]  So and if you're recharging the soil
[01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:10.190]  or like reusing the soil like Jeff does.
[01:09:12.310 --> 01:09:16.110]  I would probably say like 20 percent, 25 percent, maybe.
[01:09:16.150 --> 01:09:18.390]  All right. Maybe even as low as 15.
[01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:21.750]  It kind of depends on how much aeration your soil has
[01:09:21.750 --> 01:09:24.470]  and if you want to add any in or if or not.
[01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:26.470]  So, OK. Aeration is important.
[01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:27.950]  You guys, we learned our lesson.
[01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:31.750]  I put some plants into cocoa and I did not put anything in there to aerate it.
[01:09:32.270 --> 01:09:34.750]  And those plants pretty much gave me the middle finger their whole lives.
[01:09:34.790 --> 01:09:36.350]  Yeah. Yeah. They did not like that.
[01:09:36.350 --> 01:09:38.710]  It really compresses. Yeah. It's super compressed.
[01:09:38.710 --> 01:09:40.390]  You got to fill that up with some perlite.
[01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:43.230]  Put something in there to kind of air it up. For sure. All right.
[01:09:43.950 --> 01:09:45.950]  You can also make teas with your compost.
[01:09:46.110 --> 01:09:48.510]  Yes, that was what I was going to ask. That's awesome. Yeah.
[01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:53.670]  So with compost, make sure you you have a consistent temperature.
[01:09:53.710 --> 01:09:57.390]  I've been told if you let it get too warm,
[01:09:57.830 --> 01:10:00.750]  you can potentially have some funky stuff.
[01:10:00.990 --> 01:10:04.910]  OK. In your tea or the compost itself? In your tea. OK. All right.
[01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:09.870]  A lot of people talk crap about compost
[01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:13.310]  or you'll find people that talk shit about it.
[01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:18.070]  One of the things they claim is it has E.coli in it,
[01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:21.790]  which it possibly could have E.coli in it. OK.
[01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:27.310]  But it also has a million other fucking things that are way nastier than E.coli.
[01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:29.070]  That don't harm us.
[01:10:29.070 --> 01:10:31.630]  Wouldn't a large percentage of your fruits and vegetables
[01:10:31.630 --> 01:10:34.710]  have E.coli anyway when you purchase them? Yeah. OK.
[01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:38.190]  Trace amounts at least. They're shipped. Yeah. OK.
[01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:44.710]  It's so would that mean maybe not to use a compost tea as a foliar feed?
[01:10:44.830 --> 01:10:46.270]  That's that's the way to get around that. Right.
[01:10:46.270 --> 01:10:48.670]  Just feed it to the roots and not the foliar. Yeah.
[01:10:49.190 --> 01:10:53.110]  I personally would never use an actual compost tea for foliar either.
[01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:56.110]  I would strictly save that for worm castings. OK.
[01:10:56.230 --> 01:10:58.630]  Yeah, for sure. Without a doubt.
[01:10:58.630 --> 01:10:59.830]  All right. So that's the way to get around that.
[01:10:59.830 --> 01:11:01.190]  Yeah. No worry there. Feed it to the soil.
[01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:03.030]  Magical happen that E.coli goes away.
[01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:06.630]  Yeah. And also with compost, you can make a concentrate
[01:11:06.990 --> 01:11:10.990]  where just take your compost, put it in a cheesecloth,
[01:11:12.150 --> 01:11:15.470]  massage it in water or underneath water for about 10 minutes.
[01:11:15.710 --> 01:11:18.830]  Like put it in a bucket of water and just kind of rub it out a little. Yeah. OK.
[01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:21.390]  Yeah. Well, that's kind of what you do.
[01:11:21.390 --> 01:11:23.350]  I thought I was going to I was trying to let that joke fly.
[01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:25.270]  But that's actually what you're doing. You're rubbing it out.
[01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:27.470]  You need it like a loaf of bread.
[01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:29.670]  OK. Yeah. All right. Perverts.
[01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:33.590]  And then that makes a compost or worm casting.
[01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:36.870]  You can do either one, a concentrate.
[01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:39.310]  And it has a longer shelf life than an aerated tea.
[01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:41.590]  OK. Wow. Yeah, that's useful.
[01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:42.870]  Something I just learned. Yeah.
[01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:46.190]  So you just because you're taking old food scraps and recycled dirt
[01:11:46.190 --> 01:11:49.350]  and putting it in cheesecloth and squeezing it and making your own nutrients.
[01:11:49.470 --> 01:11:52.190]  Yeah. Why not do this? Let's stop making waste.
[01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:53.590]  Let's stop wasting shit.
[01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:56.230]  Let's stop spending money on companies that do not really support
[01:11:56.230 --> 01:11:58.750]  the cannabis movement or us or our wallets. Yeah.
[01:11:59.070 --> 01:12:02.110]  Let's stop making trucks drive across the country with bottles of water.
[01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:03.750]  Oh, man. Right.
[01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:06.910]  Because that's you're paying for what when you buy whatever brand you use.
[01:12:06.910 --> 01:12:07.830]  I love botanic air.
[01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:11.390]  But still, every time I buy a bottle of pure blend pro or liquid karma,
[01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:16.270]  I had to pay a truck to drive that shit from Arizona to Colorado.
[01:12:16.270 --> 01:12:18.630]  Then I had to pay some dude at a hydro shot with a mullet
[01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:21.310]  to fucking unload it off the truck and then sell it to me.
[01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:22.870]  And then I had to buy it home and measure it out.
[01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:26.310]  I probably could have just taken some kelp and seabird guano,
[01:12:26.310 --> 01:12:27.790]  whatever the fuck else is in that product.
[01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:29.510]  And I could have made my own probably.
[01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:32.550]  Or even vegetable sploom. Yeah.
[01:12:32.710 --> 01:12:35.910]  I mean, if you want to grow salts, you know, you can still be
[01:12:37.670 --> 01:12:40.550]  kind of environmentally friendly. Yes. Yes.
[01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:44.110]  But what I'm getting at is I can make that and I don't have to add
[01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:48.390]  to that truck driving that emissions, the water being shipped, the gas,
[01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:51.110]  the exhaust, like we could do it ourselves.
[01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:54.070]  And not only that, you're diverting
[01:12:55.870 --> 01:12:58.150]  food from going into the landfill. Exactly.
[01:12:58.150 --> 01:13:02.510]  So you're just you're basically money from going right into the same landfill.
[01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:05.190]  Yeah. Yeah. Put it back into your crop, back into your wallet.
[01:13:05.710 --> 01:13:06.990]  You're producing something.
[01:13:06.990 --> 01:13:10.950]  You're not depending on someone for that little tiny bit of your life.
[01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:12.870]  You know, it only may be that part.
[01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:17.430]  But I love, you know, trying to be a producer, not a consumer.
[01:13:17.470 --> 01:13:20.150]  So it may sound a little weird, but there's a good feeling
[01:13:20.150 --> 01:13:24.710]  knowing that my vivacious, healthy, green, vigorous cannabis
[01:13:24.710 --> 01:13:27.390]  plants are on nearly the same diet as myself.
[01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:27.990]  Oh, for sure.
[01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:30.590]  It makes me think maybe other than all this freaking Dr.
[01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:34.190]  Pepper I'm addicted to, maybe I'm green and vivacious and vigorous as well.
[01:13:34.670 --> 01:13:37.750]  Keeps me going. Keeps me strong.
[01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:39.350]  All right, dude, we've been going for like 40 minutes.
[01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:40.990]  You got anything else you want to talk about composting
[01:13:40.990 --> 01:13:43.430]  before we get a doorbell ringing? We get some new stoners showing up.
[01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:45.590]  No, no, we can wrap it up.
[01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:48.150]  We can touch back later if anyone's got any questions.
[01:13:48.190 --> 01:13:50.430]  Absolutely. You guys easily talk more. Yeah.
[01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:52.590]  You're getting good at podcasting, by the way, bro.
[01:13:52.590 --> 01:13:53.630]  You're really comfortable now.
[01:13:53.630 --> 01:13:55.190]  Thank you. Other than being a little cold in here.
[01:13:55.190 --> 01:13:57.910]  Yeah, I'm fine on that.
[01:13:57.910 --> 01:14:01.110]  I'm just I'm trying to build my schedule.
[01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:04.310]  I've got a busy life that was all of a sudden.
[01:14:04.750 --> 01:14:06.550]  Well, I don't know.
[01:14:06.790 --> 01:14:09.750]  I've always had a busy life, but, you know, a few months ago,
[01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:11.750]  it just all of a sudden like really stepped up.
[01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:13.830]  That's good. Yeah, so it's good.
[01:14:13.830 --> 01:14:16.350]  But it's bad for my podcast.
[01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:21.150]  And I have all these ideals and, you know, just plans and everything.
[01:14:21.150 --> 01:14:23.910]  I'm just trying to adjust into my schedule.
[01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:28.230]  I understand. Expect a kick ass podcast coming from me.
[01:14:28.230 --> 01:14:30.110]  Besides the Colorado podcast.
[01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:32.470]  Oh, you got a new idea coming. Yeah. Excellent.
[01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:37.350]  So I'm going to go with I'll go ahead and but it's going to be the high grade homestead.
[01:14:37.630 --> 01:14:43.430]  I like that. So and it'll be more than just cannabis growing.
[01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:45.910]  So we'll talk about gardening and
[01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:51.670]  chickens and all kinds of shit stuff you'd find on a homestead.
[01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:53.190]  I love it. I love it.
[01:14:53.190 --> 01:14:55.350]  Well, if you ever need a cannabis expert on that show.
[01:14:55.390 --> 01:14:56.590]  Oh, yeah. I'll come be on your show.
[01:14:56.590 --> 01:14:58.430]  Show planned out for you. Big show.
[01:14:58.430 --> 01:14:59.990]  Thor Haas. Thanks already.
[01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:02.710]  Big shout out to the rest of the Colorado podcast, boys.
[01:15:02.830 --> 01:15:04.710]  Thanks for letting me borrow Jesse for a little bit.
[01:15:04.710 --> 01:15:06.350]  Also, shout out to Burn.
[01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:08.430]  Thanks for letting your husband come hang out for a couple hours and get.
[01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:09.590]  I got him stupid high.
[01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:11.190]  I'm going to send him even higher.
[01:15:11.230 --> 01:15:14.390]  I'm still on the I haven't really been dabbing diet.
[01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:16.710]  Oh, man. Well, there's another dab waiting with you.
[01:15:16.710 --> 01:15:20.230]  Yeah, I just wanted to finish this show of trying to be as coherent as possible.
[01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:23.630]  Burn also takes great care of me when I go to the hydro shop.
[01:15:23.630 --> 01:15:25.470]  She's always excited to see me. She gives me a big hug.
[01:15:25.470 --> 01:15:28.150]  She's super friendly and she is great customer service.
[01:15:28.270 --> 01:15:29.430]  So big shout out to burn.
[01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:32.030]  Thanks for letting me borrow your husband for an hour or two to get a stupid rip
[01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:35.870]  and do a podcast. I look forward to hearing the house.
[01:15:36.270 --> 01:15:38.710]  Oh, homegrown homes to high grade homestead.
[01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:40.510]  There's a lot of letters to put in my brain.
[01:15:40.510 --> 01:15:41.790]  But I look forward to hearing that.
[01:15:41.790 --> 01:15:44.270]  I hope my listeners follow you on that podcast.
[01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:47.950]  I'm sure they're going to follow you on Instagram at Jesse grows.
[01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:51.630]  And they're also going to check out the Colorado podcast Instagram page
[01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:52.510]  while they're at it.
[01:15:52.510 --> 01:15:54.270]  They're going to go follow me on Instagram.
[01:15:54.270 --> 01:15:56.470]  It's Iri underscore genetics.
[01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:58.470]  Do you want to thank you for joining me on the podcast?
[01:15:58.470 --> 01:15:59.710]  We've been here for two hours.
[01:15:59.710 --> 01:16:02.110]  So I appreciate that.
[01:16:02.110 --> 01:16:04.110]  I'm going to do a couple of wrap ups.
[01:16:04.110 --> 01:16:06.710]  Make sure you find me on all the social media, guys.
[01:16:06.710 --> 01:16:08.790]  I'm on Facebook. It's the girl from your podcast.
[01:16:08.790 --> 01:16:10.750]  I'm on Twitter. It's at GFYH podcast.
[01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:14.470]  Also, you know, I would love it if you go to iTunes and leave me a rating and a review.
[01:16:14.710 --> 01:16:17.030]  I'm sure you know how to find the ratings and reviews by now.
[01:16:17.470 --> 01:16:19.630]  Everybody so far has given me a five star review.
[01:16:20.030 --> 01:16:21.270]  You know, it'd be cool if you follow suit.
[01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:23.470]  But if you feel like you want to be different, do what you need to do.
[01:16:24.150 --> 01:16:26.630]  Also, let me remind you about a new service I've signed up for.
[01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:28.670]  It is called Patreon.
[01:16:28.670 --> 01:16:31.070]  Patreon is a service that will allow my listeners
[01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:34.950]  to make a financial contribution to the show if they feel so inclined,
[01:16:34.950 --> 01:16:38.390]  if you feel like the information or knowledge or friendship I have provided you
[01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:43.430]  or just you want to throw some money around, go to Patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[01:16:43.710 --> 01:16:48.430]  And what that will allow you to do is sign up to contribute a monthly contribution.
[01:16:48.430 --> 01:16:50.310]  You can contribute as little as one dollar.
[01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:53.390]  I honestly don't think there's a limit to the amount of zeros you can add to that.
[01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:54.110]  I don't think there is.
[01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:56.670]  Yeah. So however many zeros you want to add to that dollar sign,
[01:16:57.190 --> 01:16:59.630]  go ahead, put a one, put a five, put a nine in front of there.
[01:16:59.630 --> 01:17:00.430]  However you want to do it.
[01:17:01.310 --> 01:17:03.590]  No, I would appreciate, though, if you sign up for Patreon,
[01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:05.390]  you can contribute one dollar to the show.
[01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:07.630]  It will charge you every the first of every month.
[01:17:07.630 --> 01:17:09.870]  And then that will send that right over to my PayPal account.
[01:17:10.110 --> 01:17:12.790]  And honestly, I'm not trying to make a bunch of money off my friends and my listeners.
[01:17:12.790 --> 01:17:16.310]  What that will do, that will help me pay for the cost of my website.
[01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:20.630]  You guys, I read genetics, Colorado dot com cost me about three hundred and fifteen dollars
[01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:22.630]  per year to keep up there.
[01:17:22.630 --> 01:17:24.430]  And that is how I deliver you this podcast.
[01:17:24.430 --> 01:17:25.190]  I'm not trying to get rich.
[01:17:25.190 --> 01:17:26.230]  I'm just trying to offset that.
[01:17:26.230 --> 01:17:27.710]  I'm not trying to pay for that out of my pocket.
[01:17:29.150 --> 01:17:29.950]  Not begging either.
[01:17:29.950 --> 01:17:31.830]  So if you would like to go to Patreon, go check it out.
[01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:33.990]  Patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[01:17:34.390 --> 01:17:35.830]  I would really appreciate it.
[01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:38.510]  Also, yeah, Jesse says do it and he's a big guy.
[01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:39.710]  So I did it even.
[01:17:39.710 --> 01:17:40.470]  Yeah, Jesse did do it.
[01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:42.830]  Jesse was my second contributor to Patreon.
[01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:44.190]  That's where I was headed next.
[01:17:44.190 --> 01:17:47.550]  Big shout out to all three of the people who have contributed to my Patreon so far.
[01:17:47.550 --> 01:17:48.830]  I appreciate all three of you.
[01:17:48.830 --> 01:17:51.430]  I'm not sure if everybody wants to be listed by name.
[01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:53.550]  So you know who you are.
[01:17:53.550 --> 01:17:55.190]  Big shout out. Much love. Much respect.
[01:17:55.190 --> 01:17:57.110]  I appreciate the support.
[01:17:57.110 --> 01:18:00.150]  Even if you can't contribute to Patreon, you guys, I love you.
[01:18:00.150 --> 01:18:02.310]  And I appreciate you just for listening to the podcast.
[01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:03.190]  You don't have to give me money.
[01:18:03.190 --> 01:18:04.910]  You don't have to give me anything to be my friend.
[01:18:04.910 --> 01:18:05.870]  I love you guys.
[01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:08.310]  I appreciate you being there and supporting the podcast.
[01:18:08.310 --> 01:18:10.630]  I extra especially support.
[01:18:10.630 --> 01:18:12.150]  Thank you for supporting cannabis.
[01:18:12.150 --> 01:18:13.310]  You guys had a lot of caffeine and dabs.
[01:18:13.310 --> 01:18:14.470]  My brain's going too fast.
[01:18:14.470 --> 01:18:15.950]  But I appreciate you for supporting cannabis.
[01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:20.110]  And like I said earlier, I completely trust you or thank you for trusting me
[01:18:20.310 --> 01:18:22.790]  to be your cannabis guru. It means a lot to me.
[01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:25.630]  It sounds like I need to wrap up the show because my tongue is tying itself
[01:18:25.630 --> 01:18:26.670]  in a damn knot.
[01:18:26.670 --> 01:18:30.030]  So I think all I have to say now is a big shout out to my friend,
[01:18:30.030 --> 01:18:31.190]  the barefoot grower.
[01:18:31.190 --> 01:18:34.390]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:14.920]  The made her off the great.
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:25:55.120]  Welcome back, cannabis community.
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:58.560]  It's time for episode number 171 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:01.960]  Your source for cannabis news, education and conversation.
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:04.520]  That's right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:08.160]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:11.160]  or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:13.920]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:16.600]  I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:18.360]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:20.160]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you.
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:22.160]  Shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:24.360]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:28.320]  Big shout out to Kat Koot and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:31.200]  Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, across the table from me,
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:34.560]  the repeat offender, returning champion, ladies and gentlemen, White Mike is back.
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:36.680]  What's up, everybody? Thanks for joining me, bro.
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:40.120]  Yeah, man. If you guys want to stalk White Mike while you're listening to him,
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:42.320]  make sure you follow him on Twitter.
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:44.240]  It's at Nemo Punk 15.
[01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:47.040]  Also remind everybody how they can check out your Facebook group.
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:50.040]  It's Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws on Facebook.
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:53.000]  Check us out, folks. Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws on Facebook.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.080]  Mike, I'm going to turn your microphone up for some reason.
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:56.240]  Bring me up a little bit.
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:57.160]  I may be getting a head cold.
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:58.240]  Something sounds a little muffly.
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:26:59.840]  I apologize, listeners, if it's muffly.
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:01.200]  I hope it's just my head.
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:02.520]  Is it in your head or is it in the gear?
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:05.040]  Yeah, I'm thinking it's in the headphones because the music sounds good,
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:06.320]  but my voice sounds stupid.
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:07.920]  So it's just it's just my head.
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:09.080]  I apologize for that, folks.
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:10.560]  I'm going to get over it and we're going to do a podcast.
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:11.600]  Thanks for joining me, dude.
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:12.640]  Yeah, man.
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:15.640]  Make sure you guys support Mike on the Twitter and follow Pueblo
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:16.640]  for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:18.920]  Check out what he's posting there on Facebook.
[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:21.360]  We truly appreciate the cannabis advocates.
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:23.040]  Dude, did you hear Granny give you a shout out?
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:24.120]  I did. I did.
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:25.360]  I appreciate that, Granny.
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:28.600]  It's it was fun meeting you the one time we got to meet at Candy Canyon,
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:30.800]  and I can't wait till we run into each other again.
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:33.040]  I will get you guys here together on this podcast.
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:34.240]  It'll be a good time. Right.
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:35.520]  I'll do my best. Sounds good to me.
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:37.080]  She will get you high as giraffe pussy.
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:38.120]  Oh, Granny's awesome.
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:40.840]  Is the basket of magic.
[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:41.720]  The basket. Yes.
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:43.360]  Granny and her basket of magic.
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:45.360]  Yep. Granny got to meet Action Bronson
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:47.680]  the other day, and that was one of the coolest photos I've ever seen.
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:49.280]  Davin Granny and Action Bronson.
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:51.200]  So shout out to Davin Granny.
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:53.600]  Also, since we're doing shout outs, I need to give a huge shout out
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:55.840]  to my friends at Handmade Apparel.
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:28:00.400]  So if you guys need any sort of T-shirt printing, some stickers, some hat pins.

[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:09.480]  There is a Facebook group and a Facebook page.
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:12.400]  You guys, they printed me some Grow From Your Heart podcast hoodies.
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:14.560]  They've printed my iReed Genetics T-shirts.
[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:17.360]  I've got a bright red handmade apparel hoodie.
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:19.520]  I've got a green handmade apparel hoodie.
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:20.640]  I've got hat pins.
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:25.240]  I've got stickers that these folks made and everything is top quality.
[01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:27.520]  It's made in America by Americans.
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:29.280]  It's made by dab kids who take dabs.
[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:31.200]  They dab just as hard as you and I do.
[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:32.960]  So I think it's great to support the community.
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:36.080]  I think it's great to support our friends that are doing this with us.
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:37.600]  I really like these people.
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:39.280]  They're good friends of mine and they make great shit.
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:41.360]  So please support them as much as I do.

[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:47.240]  You can get that sweet handmade apparel logo on the side of your shirt like I've got.
[01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:49.200]  We could all be in the same handmade gang.
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:50.120]  It's pretty awesome.
[01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:52.120]  Big shout out to the Handmade crew.
[01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:55.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, go to Handmade Apparel dot biz and check them out.
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:56.080]  Get some stuff printed.
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:58.520]  I'm a big fan of the quality.
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:01.400]  Typically shirts that are printed with logos and stuff.
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:03.680]  The logo goes first.
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:05.760]  I've got all of my handmade stuff.
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:08.240]  The shirt is going a little before the logo.
[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:09.600]  The logo still looks fresh.
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:13.160]  You know, I wear if you know me, I'm kind of a cartoon character is what they call me.
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:16.040]  I've got a hoodie with IRI Genetics logo and I take off my hoodie
[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:18.000]  and underneath that is an IRI Genetics t shirt.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.120]  Right. Is the exact same logo in a different?
[01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:23.880]  I've been wearing probably I have not thrown any of them away.
[01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:26.480]  I've been rocking these t shirts for probably five years now.
[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:28.960]  And from the first one, I have not thrown it away.
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:30.240]  The logo is still crispy.
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:32.880]  The shirt, however, is getting it's getting that black shirt
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:35.560]  dinged to it, but the logo looks like it was freshly painted.
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:36.520]  It looks sweet.
[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:38.200]  I mean, it can only hold up for so long.
[01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:41.800]  I mean, I beat the living hell out of mine and the logo still looks fresh.
[01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:44.880]  They're sweet shirts, so I think we've given them a huge shout out.
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:47.400]  Big thanks to my friends at Handmade Apparel for all the stuff they've printed.
[01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:50.240]  You guys, they have the best rates for hat pins.
[01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:52.680]  If you're getting your hat pins made, go through Handmade Apparel.
[01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:54.040]  I went through I tried a lot of companies.
[01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:55.920]  Handmade Apparel was the most reliable.
[01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:58.480]  They do the artwork in-house and they have the pins made.
[01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:00.240]  So it's all one one group.
[01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:02.520]  So you don't have to have different people working together and fucking you up.
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:04.640]  They do great artwork.
[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:05.480]  I love those guys.
[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:06.800]  So shout out. Much respect.
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:09.720]  Big hugs. All that stuff to our friends at Handmade Apparel.
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:10.360]  Make sure you check them out.
[01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:11.240]  Handmade Apparel dot biz.
[01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:13.680]  I think I've said that enough times.
[01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:15.840]  What else you want to chatter about before we get into our main topic,
[01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:18.440]  Mike, or do you want to jump into it?
[01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:22.240]  God, it feels like so much has happened since the last time I was on here.
[01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:25.400]  Lots of stuff's happened since the election.
[01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:27.040]  We should probably just dive right into the show.
[01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:29.880]  Let's go to. Yeah, let's start off with the letter from the D.A.
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:31.280]  that came out just a couple of days ago.
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:33.120]  And then we will do if we have time for it.
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:35.960]  We will do a couple of election updates because I know you love getting to that.
[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:38.240]  Listeners have asked for longer lessons.
[01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:39.840]  That was me clapping. I don't clap like that.
[01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:40.880]  Why did I do that?
[01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:44.120]  Yeah, listeners. A lot of listeners are like, hey, bro, I want a longer episode.
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:45.920]  You guys, I've taken on a new project.
[01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:47.960]  I don't talk a lot about this project that I'm doing.
[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:52.760]  I've kind of kept it on the down low, but it keeps me busy for 45 or 50 hours a week.
[01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:55.600]  So I haven't been doing two podcast episodes.
[01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:56.680]  I apologize.
[01:30:56.680 --> 01:30:58.640]  I'm going to do my best to get longer episodes.
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:02.360]  And I know that the past couple episodes have been a little not as informative.
[01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:04.080]  I was over fucking whelmed.
[01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:05.880]  You guys, it's the holiday season.
[01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:07.560]  Everybody's super busy right now.
[01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:09.560]  Yeah, yeah. I've got I've got a kiddo.
[01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:11.320]  I've got friends. I'm doing a new project.
[01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:13.720]  I was hanging out with my mom earlier today for quite some time
[01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:15.440]  talking about Christmas presents and stuff.
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:16.160]  I don't feel good.
[01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:19.280]  So you just wrapped a killer outdoor grove session again.
[01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:20.160]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:23.120]  Big shout out to Jesse for coming and helping us do some outdoor grow lessons.
[01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:25.800]  So I love those series or that series every year.
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.840]  I feel like I got to pack so much info in every single episode, though.
[01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:31.040]  So when I don't give a full informative episode,
[01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:33.000]  I feel like I'm kind of cheating myself and the listeners.
[01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:36.480]  Right. There are episodes where I've had to stop and pause repeatedly
[01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:37.960]  while I take notes.
[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:40.440]  They're so hyper detailed. It's fantastic.
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:44.600]  I've got and I know I keep saying I've got those podcasts in the works.
[01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:46.480]  The ones are going to have got the folder right here in my hand.
[01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:47.040]  You can hear this.
[01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:49.440]  This is all this page gets more impressive every week.
[01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:51.200]  Yeah, I'm going to do those.
[01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:52.680]  I'm just I'm trying to perfect them.
[01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:54.400]  Those are episodes that are going to be in depth.
[01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:56.000]  And I'm kind of a perfectionist.
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.280]  So when they come out like that, they're really good.
[01:31:58.280 --> 01:32:01.920]  But this episode we're going to talk about you like I pulled that background.
[01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:04.000]  I've been podcasting a while in this podcast.
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.800]  We're going to talk about a letter that the D.A.
[01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:08.320]  sent who the hell did they send it to?
[01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:10.680]  Did they just publish it or was it actually mailed to people?
[01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:13.600]  This was the big dust up this week.
[01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:20.200]  The the letter that everyone freaked out about over CBD.
[01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:21.960]  Did your face just break?
[01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:24.000]  Well, this story almost broke me.
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:30.360]  The big dust up is basically saying the D.A.
[01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:32.280]  just made CBD illegal again.
[01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:35.240]  And that's silly because it was never legal.
[01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:36.240]  Right. We're going to get to that.
[01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:39.720]  Let me read this news article and then we'll we're definitely going to talk about
[01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:41.840]  why it's silly and we'll talk about a lot of details.
[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:44.960]  There are a lot of different versions of this article.
[01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:48.080]  The main part that I want to focus on is a quote.
[01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:52.840]  So this story is a great example of just how fake news can be.
[01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:56.400]  Right. With the different degrees of bullshit, they can work their way
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:57.200]  into a press story.
[01:32:57.200 --> 01:32:59.000]  I've read it in three or four different locations.
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:03.040]  And the part I want to focus on is mainly quoted from the D.A. themselves.
[01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:03.920]  So that can't be wrong.
[01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:07.480]  And then the buffers around it, we can talk shit about a blot on every website.
[01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:11.480]  So this one I chose the one the Leafley article looked like a crock of shit to me.
[01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:13.320]  I didn't like the Leafley article.
[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:16.800]  So I chose to go with the article from the Green Rush Daily.
[01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:19.040]  Shout out to the Green Rush Daily.
[01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:22.400]  The headline is the D.A. just banned CBD and here's why.
[01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:23.920]  And then there's a giant ad.
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:26.720]  And then I finally scroll like seven scrolls and I get to the article.
[01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:30.320]  It says the legality of CBD is no longer in the gray area.
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:34.160]  In fact, the D.A. just banned CBD, cementing its place
[01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:36.840]  in the list of Schedule one substances.
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:41.760]  CBD or cannabidiol is a compound or cannabinoid
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:43.800]  in cannabis that won't get you high.
[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:47.720]  What it does do, though, is stop seizures and aid in suffering from Dilip.
[01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:49.440]  Dilip to Jesus.
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:52.360]  I'm the one that wanted to talk shit about an article and I can't speak English
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:55.080]  words. Debilitating is the word I was trying to say.
[01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:58.840]  I nailed cannabinoid and cannabidiol, but I can't say debilitating you guys.
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:01.560]  So the question, full, especially on a phone.
[01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:05.720]  Yeah, especially after all those dabs that the dabs never help with reading aloud.
[01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:06.360]  That's true.
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:10.120]  Um, I may be the exception to that rule.
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:11.960]  I'm an introvert.
[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:13.240]  And then sometimes when I smoke a lot of.
[01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:14.160]  Oh, definitely.
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:16.280]  And I want to go for that. Yeah, yeah.
[01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:17.520]  OK, so we'll keep going.
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:19.800]  It says so why is the D.A. putting it on?
[01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:22.920]  Why is the D.A. putting it on the list of the most harmful drugs available to man?
[01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:26.040]  Probably the same reasons they temporarily banned the herbal pain
[01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:28.040]  reliever, Kratom, earlier this year.
[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:30.760]  They're both alternatives to more dangerous prescription opiates
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:32.320]  that are plaguing the country.
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:35.360]  The D.A. action seemed to protect big pharma's pockets
[01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:37.840]  more than the health of American citizens.
[01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:39.480]  That's not the point that I wanted to get to.
[01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:41.640]  They're talking about a conspiracy that I agree with.
[01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:44.840]  It was they were doing so well and then they went off in the fucktard land.
[01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:46.840]  Yes, yes. Well, just just that quick.
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:49.920]  Well, fucktard land was somewhere I wanted to venture into later in the episode.
[01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:51.480]  I didn't want to jump right into it.
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:54.640]  Parkville, because I think that may have something to do with it.
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:57.560]  They see that there are pharmaceutical companies working with it.
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:34:59.680]  They don't want us having that market.
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:01.160]  They want to corner that before we do.
[01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:03.680]  So they're just going to shut us down like, oh, no, you can't even play.
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:05.160]  So now we win.
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:07.320]  They just landed on free parking by fucking us.
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:09.280]  But I want to keep going.
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:12.320]  The archaic spelling of the word marijuana with an H is used in the text
[01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:15.000]  and federal and the Federal Register announcing the rule
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:18.440]  probably to avoid turning up in marijuana related search results.
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:20.680]  Oh, wow. Is that true?
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:23.800]  They think that no, it's just how the fucking feds spell it.
[01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:25.440]  You fucking conspiracy.
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:25.960]  Fuck you.
[01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:31.240]  When I read it, as soon as you said, when I read Rush Daily, I was like, oh, fuck.
[01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:33.160]  And then he said, you should have been at the top.
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:34.760]  And I went, oh, you should have warned me because, yeah,
[01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:35.920]  and I knew where this was going.
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:38.640]  But I think this will be helpful for our listeners.
[01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:43.080]  Yeah, because I thought it was two ways to spot marijuana with an H.
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:46.760]  Yeah, it's the that's just how the feds spell marijuana.
[01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:52.680]  The and this is where what a lot of the fake news is oriented around.
[01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:57.960]  Basically, everybody has heard of CBD by now.
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:02.240]  Coast to coast is CBD's a household term.
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:06.800]  Now, people have seen through Sanjay Gupta's specials
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:11.560]  and through YouTube videos and Facebook posts how helpful it can be with Parkinson's,
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:17.360]  with seizure disorders, with DeVay syndrome, with pain management,
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:23.960]  with the change in federal policy,
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:26.920]  with the Ogden memo and the Cole memo that led to
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:31.760]  marijuana markets like we have here in Colorado, whether legal.
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:35.800]  Some of those like Colorado's included legal hemp.
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:38.840]  And so last year, the year before the feds,
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:43.320]  just like the colonogued memos did for high THC cannabis,
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:48.400]  they put out a little blurb in the farm bill covering industrial hemp
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:52.480]  and putting a definition for what industrial hemp is.
[01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:56.200]  And so under the guise of that legal loophole,
[01:36:56.640 --> 01:37:01.280]  a number of companies, both domestic and foreign, started selling TV
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:05.720]  or CBD extract online in all 50 states,
[01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:07.960]  making it available pretty much everywhere.
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:10.760]  Companies like CBD Lifewater have sprung up
[01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:13.160]  that are trying to get distribution in all 50 states.
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:18.320]  And it's under a gray market loophole created by the farm bill.
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:20.320]  It is in no way legal.
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:23.360]  The feds have always considered every part of the cannabis plant.
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:26.360]  It doesn't matter if it's sativa, indica, hemp, rooter Alice.
[01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:27.120]  They don't give a shit.
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:29.880]  Let me jump in right there, because that's right where I am in this article.
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:32.160]  And they spell it marijuana with an H.
[01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:36.720]  Why? Because these laws are based in fucking racism.
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:41.800]  And that was a lot of where the original basis for these comes from.
[01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:44.840]  So when the feds write a new marijuana law, it's on the backs
[01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:49.280]  of all the old marijuana laws and they keep the same racist ass spelling.
[01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:50.960]  All right.
[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:53.920]  Just give me a look like I know, but let me finish the article.
[01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:56.960]  Yeah, you're fired up and I like it, but I have to get through this article
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:37:58.920]  to make the show a show.
[01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:01.880]  It's the reason, given that the US is complying
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:04.000]  with the international drug control treaties.
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:06.320]  Wait, the reason giving is that the OK,
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:11.360]  it says that they are so the stated reason for the change this week is
[01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:14.760]  to help them comply with international narcotics treaties.
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:18.600]  Then they say before this elaboration, CBD's legality was in a gray area.
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:22.200]  It was assumed that CBD extracted from medical cannabis was only legal
[01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:24.840]  for medical marijuana patients and illegal to the rest.
[01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:30.040]  However, CBD derived from industrial hemp was being sold across the country
[01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:32.200]  as if it were federally federally legal.
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:35.440]  Well, apparently the DEA has always believed any form of cannabis
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:37.480]  extract to be schedule one.
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:42.760]  OK, I want to if I handed you a CBD molecule, a scientist, a CBD molecule.
[01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:44.960]  And I said, did this come from hemp or cannabis?
[01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:47.720]  You'd probably tell me to go fuck myself because it's the same thing.
[01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:50.000]  You'd say it's a molecule.
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:53.760]  So the DEA claims that there are small amounts of cannabinoids in every CBD
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:57.440]  extract. They cite this as another reason to keep CBD on schedule one.
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:39:01.760]  For practical purposes, all extracts that contain CBD will also contain
[01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:04.520]  at least a small amount of other cannabinoids.
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:09.320]  However, if it were possible to produce the form of cannabis plant.
[01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:11.560]  Sorry, they wrote this weird and there's an ad right here.
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:13.400]  I'm skipping through it. Let's see.
[01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:16.640]  Produced from the cannabis plant extract that contain only CBD and no other
[01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:20.640]  cannabinoids, such an extract would fall within the new drug code.
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:24.800]  So basically the DEA made extracting CBD completely illegal,
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:27.720]  whether it's from hemp or not, whether it is pure CBD,
[01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:30.520]  because they are wrong right there when they say that you can't get pure CBD,
[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:33.760]  because I know I'm thinking, counting.
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:37.720]  I can put five fingers up and confidently say that I know five people that I can
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:39.880]  call friends that can make CBD isolate.
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:42.560]  That is 99.8 or 9% CBD.
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:45.560]  That one or 2% is atmospheric conditions.
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:48.600]  There are things like oxygen in there that they cannot control.
[01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:52.840]  Yeah. Um, it's, you can get a hundred percent pure CBD,
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:55.840]  um, lots of different places. The, the,
[01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:59.560]  the DEA's position on it doesn't have anything to do with there being trace
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:01.520]  cannabinoids in it. Um,
[01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:04.760]  that's just something that happened to mumble during the press conference.
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:08.040]  So it's always been, but CBD's always been illegal, just like cannabis.
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:12.400]  Every part of the cannabis plant is illegal federally. Um,
[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:16.920]  the seeds are illegal. The leaves are illegal. The root ball is illegal.
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:20.000]  The pot you grew it in is illegal. Um,
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:24.800]  it doesn't matter if it's industrial hemp, um, every year,
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:29.000]  um, or I'm just to be safe every 18 months, uh,
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.800]  some drug task force somewhere like East bumfuck,
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:35.520]  Texas makes the announcement that they've just found the world's biggest pot
[01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:38.560]  farm. Um, and they're rating it today and they,
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:43.600]  they didn't catch any growers and it's headline news on Monday and it's
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:45.080]  headline news on Tuesday.
[01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:49.640]  And then there's nothing about it in the press on Wednesday and next Friday,
[01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:54.080]  it comes out that it was a wild hemp fields on some farmers back
[01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:57.400]  400, 400 acres in the middle of nowhere.
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:02.440]  And it was the weather conditions that spring were perfect for feral hemp to go
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:04.080]  nuts. Um,
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:08.440]  and the D a spend a hundred thousand dollars ripping all of that feral hemp out
[01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:12.680]  of the ground and burning it. Um, because it's the dangerous marijuana plant.
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:14.720]  It doesn't matter that it's growing wild. It doesn't have any.
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:18.880]  If you smoked any of that stuff, if you harvested, dried and cured it properly,
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:20.600]  all that shit would do is give you a headache.
[01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:25.280]  There was a, an Indian reservation. Um, I want to say it was in New Mexico,
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:29.000]  um, somewhere hot and kind of miserable to live. Um,
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:33.800]  where feral hemp was just everywhere. They couldn't do anything about it.
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:35.400]  It was an issue. Um,
[01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:39.280]  and they'd found a way to basically build whole houses with it,
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:42.680]  with him creating a couple of other products and they were doing it all on site.
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:48.160]  Um, and the feds would show up every now and again and burn their hemp down,
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:52.720]  um, because it's dangerous hemp. Um, and this happens all over the country.
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:54.880]  The DEA wastes small fortunes,
[01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:58.720]  ripping wild hemp plants out of the ground that are leftover from the thirties
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:02.520]  and forties when hemp was grown as a crop all over the U S when there's a
[01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:05.000]  terrible heroin epidemic everywhere right now,
[01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:08.600]  like Colorado Springs is littered with crystal meth.
[01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:10.040]  Meth is everywhere in Springs.
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:11.280]  People are driving around on bicycles,
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:14.120]  looking at fucking trash cans all over Colorado Springs. Pueblo,
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:17.960]  Pueblo is dead. It's Friday night right now. You guys, it's Friday night at 10 30.
[01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:21.080]  It's fucking quiet. All the people that used to be outraging doing heroin,
[01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:24.080]  not all, but I mean a good fucking portion of our young people are out doing
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:28.000]  heroin right now. And the DEA is worried about fucking with plants that keep us
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:28.480]  cool.
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:33.480]  I mean not even cannabis or fun cannabis that gets you stoned and they're hemp.
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:39.000]  The stuff you make jeans with, um,
[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:42.960]  houses, bricks, textiles, necklaces, right?
[01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:47.080]  There's an infinite number of products you can make with, with hemp.
[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:49.400]  And that was part of the reason they,
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:54.120]  they included the exemption in the farm bill last year, the year before to,
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:59.920]  um, to designate what exactly is industrial hemp. Um, because everybody,
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:04.440]  I mean, everybody, everybody understands how absurd our, our hemp laws are.
[01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:07.760]  Um, but as far as law enforcement's concerned,
[01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:10.600]  cops can't tell the difference between hemp and weed.
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:13.720]  And they're pretty sure you can grow the two next to each other.
[01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:17.960]  So you could hide your high THC plants and among your hemp plants,
[01:43:17.980 --> 01:43:21.600]  which anyone that's ever grown either crop knows how insane that is.
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:26.280]  But law enforcement across the country still argue shit like that in federal
[01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:30.080]  court to keep the DEA decisions like this.
[01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:32.000]  And Saul's growing a bunch of, uh,
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:36.080]  it's all CBD plants and it looks like killer cannabis plants.
[01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:38.520]  If they told me that that was white widow or something,
[01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:40.920]  I honestly couldn't tell the difference on their plants.
[01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:43.560]  They have got very cannabis looking.
[01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:45.520]  Some of them can be very, very similar.
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:49.600]  It depends what the hemp you're growing has been bred to do. Yeah. Um,
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:54.360]  and if I understand what SunSol is doing is they're producing, um,
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:55.440]  CBD extract.
[01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:57.800]  It looks like flow. It grows just like flow.
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:03.000]  That's the type of hemp you would want for a high CBD extract production.
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:06.440]  But that I'm guessing that hemp strain would be crap if they tried to make
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:10.600]  fuel oil or fiber. It's not fibrous. Um, I mean,
[01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:13.720]  and that's one of the great things about cannabis is it can be bred one way or
[01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:18.360]  the other to achieve an infinite number of final products. Um,
[01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:22.120]  but as far as the feds are concerned, every single part of it's illegal.
[01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:24.440]  The only legal hemp, um,
[01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:29.440]  or marijuana products that are federally legal in the United States are hemp
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:33.440]  clothing produced in other countries or produced from fabric that was grown in
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:37.160]  other countries and silly lotions and hemp seed oil, lotions.
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:43.120]  I mean, products that were produced with plant material grown in other
[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:48.040]  countries. Um, everything else is at least a gray market.
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:51.520]  Um, the FDA and a couple other, um,
[01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:54.680]  national safety organizations released the thing.
[01:44:54.680 --> 01:44:59.200]  We even did a blurb about it on the show about the foreign companies selling,
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:03.160]  God knows what is CBD extract or CBD product.
[01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:08.240]  They were testing it and it didn't have a lot of CBD in it. Um,
[01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:10.360]  or maybe it did, but it had a lot of other crap in it.
[01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:14.640]  You didn't want to along with it is filler. Um,
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:19.480]  that's what you get in a gray market. You get a lot of knockoff products.
[01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:22.360]  You get a lot of mislabeled products. Um,
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:26.240]  and this is why I've been freaking out about getting people politically active.
[01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:28.800]  Do you think they're doing this for their own financial gain?
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:31.640]  Do you think the pharmaceutical companies are planning something with CBD
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:32.480]  products?
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:36.800]  Um, there's a couple in great Britain and around the country that are already
[01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:40.920]  working with, um, THC, CBD products. Um,
[01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:45.960]  GW pharmaceuticals is working a couple of different product lines. Um,
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:49.520]  but there's still five, 10 years for market. Um,
[01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:54.560]  I'm sure that the pharmaceutical industry don't, don't want, um,
[01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:59.200]  THC and see, like they would prefer to, as an industry,
[01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:01.960]  I'm sure they would prefer to have, um,
[01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:06.240]  control of all medications that people take,
[01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:09.080]  but that's not physically possible.
[01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:10.200]  They don't want to make me better.
[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:13.400]  They want to mask my symptoms and keep feeding me a pill to make me a customer.
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:17.800]  And greed is like the one conspiracy theory you're going to get me to buy into
[01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:22.640]  anywhere. But with a decision like this, this is just business as usual.
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:24.600]  This is the exact same. I mean,
[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:29.400]  this has been true since 1940 and people are freaking out about this decision
[01:46:29.420 --> 01:46:30.760]  today because they issued it.
[01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:34.680]  It's own serial number so they can track the Caesars separately.
[01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:37.240]  Um, and I mean,
[01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:41.560]  I encourage the move because tracking shit separately is helpful. Um,
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:42.360]  right now,
[01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:46.280]  any anti-marijuana group is going to tell you that 10 years ago,
[01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:47.360]  15 years ago,
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:52.360]  the average THC content in marijuana was one to 3% and they can back that up
[01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:54.720]  with DEA seizure numbers.
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:59.480]  And the reason that's true is because they've been seizing fields of fucking
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:04.120]  barrel hemp every year for decades. Um,
[01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:08.800]  and, uh, I mean, it's always been illegal.
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:13.120]  This is nothing new. Tracking it separately helps us figure out, okay,
[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:16.920]  exactly how much did they waste ripping up half out of the ground? Um,
[01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:20.600]  how much money did they waste making sure Kansas didn't get their hemp seed last
[01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:21.880]  year? Um,
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:25.400]  how much money did they waste rounding up hemp seed off the internet or hemp
[01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:26.240]  oil off the internet?
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:28.400]  Yeah. Off the side of the highway as you drive to New Mexico.
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:29.480]  I mean, it's nuts.
[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:35.080]  Now how many people since they've got these companies that are shipping CBD,
[01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:39.560]  uh, they're going to have to like the people there's a company. I don't,
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:40.840]  I don't know if I want to say anybody's names.
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:41.840]  I don't want to get any people in trouble,
[01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:45.040]  but I know people personally and there are companies in Colorado that will ship
[01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:47.240]  CBD products nationwide. You can be in Maine,
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:51.760]  California and they will send you a bottle of CBD tincture. Uh,
[01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:55.360]  how are those people that were relying on those medicine?
[01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:58.560]  What are they going to do now? That's who I'm mainly worried about.
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:02.560]  They're screwed. Um, but they were always like,
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:06.200]  their access was only obtained through a gray market.
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:08.600]  And if they were paying attention, they knew that.
[01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:13.120]  And they've been lobbying for a different way to access, uh,
[01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:16.960]  whatever product they desperately need in their area.
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:21.200]  Um, I would love to say, come to Colorado and we've got CBD for you,
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:24.080]  but there is a CBD drought. Yep. The only way,
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:27.320]  like everybody thinks they're going to come to Colorado and go to a medical
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:31.360]  dispensary and get Heidi CBD medicine. And they are highly disappointed.
[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:32.600]  There is not much.
[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:37.760]  Is expensive because it's, it's, uh,
[01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:40.160]  there's a shortage and there's been a shortage for a while.
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:43.760]  You've got to find yourself a private caregiver who they're trying to squeeze
[01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:44.880]  out of the system now anyway,
[01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:48.200]  or you've got to grow it yourself and then you've got to find a CBD clone or
[01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:50.400]  you've got to find seeds of something high CBD,
[01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:52.880]  and then you've got to grow it and then you've got to get it tested.
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:54.400]  Or I don't know,
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:57.080]  people focus a little bit too much on testing when it comes to personal
[01:48:57.080 --> 01:48:59.040]  medicine. I think I'm going to do an episode on this.
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:01.640]  I'm going to write this down. I think that the medicine,
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:04.280]  I think if medicine works for you, it works for you.
[01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:05.600]  Don't pay attention to the lab testing.
[01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:07.560]  And there's a lot of elaboration I want to do on that,
[01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:08.520]  but we'll save it for another.
[01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:11.960]  There's a lot of stuff that lab testing brought to the community.
[01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:13.040]  That's just bizarre.
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:17.880]  People focus on all the wrong numbers and that's, I mean,
[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:23.560]  I loved watching the CBD industry explode over the last two years.
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:27.520]  I don't take that from what I'm saying.
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:30.800]  Cause I think that should be available to everyone everywhere.
[01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:35.640]  I think this society would be a lot better if more people were adding CBD to
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:40.280]  their diets regularly as a supplement. It helps with a bunch of stuff.
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:41.760]  I'm a huge CBD advocate.
[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:42.600]  I use it daily.
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:44.280]  What's your daily dose of CBD?
[01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:49.400]  Right now I'm restricting myself because the product I'm using,
[01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:53.480]  I'm limited on accessing any more of it ever. That won't happen.
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:56.960]  It's gone. The person that's making it is gone.
[01:49:56.960 --> 01:49:59.160]  And so I'm kind of making it last.
[01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:01.080]  That's always the worst part about these products.
[01:50:01.080 --> 01:50:06.240]  Yep. And right now I'm at two or three CBD dabs a day.
[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:07.640]  Okay.
[01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:11.200]  And I space them throughout the day. And it depends if I'm not hurting that day,
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:14.320]  maybe I'll only take one, maybe I'll take just a little itty bitty one.
[01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:18.600]  Maybe I'll just use some of the pain cream I've got left instead.
[01:50:19.960 --> 01:50:23.880]  But that's on purpose. I'm purposely going slow.
[01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:26.040]  Before then,
[01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:31.560]  or like when I was taking it as a milligram pills, it was 50 milligrams a day.
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:33.560]  Do you take that?
[01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:35.120]  25 in the morning, 25 at night.
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:39.000]  That was my next question. Okay. 25. So 25 to keep you pain free at day 25,
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:40.120]  to get you sleeping through the night.
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:44.880]  Well, just making it easy. Cause I never kind of went wild with it.
[01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:47.560]  Cause I like it half and half THC CBD.
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:51.440]  And I didn't want to be eating 50 milligrams of THC before.
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:53.440]  Like I went out and did my day.
[01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:57.840]  So I was keeping it to 25 and then adding more during the day if I needed to.
[01:50:58.040 --> 01:50:58.880]  Okay.
[01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:02.440]  But I can consume huge amounts of CBD when I'm hurting.
[01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:07.320]  Like I've got an issue with two of the vertebrae in my back and it
[01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:10.440]  doesn't happen often, but every now and then they twang off each other,
[01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:15.080]  kind of like a rubber band. And that feeling is pretty excruciating.
[01:51:15.080 --> 01:51:18.480]  And then the area around where those two twang,
[01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:24.080]  we'll get inflamed and hurt for several days in that to a degree where I can't
[01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:25.200]  really bend or work.
[01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:29.760]  And if I feel it's twang and I eat a whole bunch of CBD,
[01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:31.760]  like 300 milligrams right away,
[01:51:32.120 --> 01:51:34.640]  it won't inflame to the point where I'm down the next day.
[01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:36.720]  That's a, I was, yeah, I've,
[01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:39.920]  I've heard a lot about if you get on it as soon as you feel it,
[01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:43.800]  like as soon as you feel it, get that, like get that CBD edible in you.
[01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:46.120]  And if you can take a dab because dab is.
[01:51:46.760 --> 01:51:50.000]  It's instant absorption. Yeah. Dab is instant effect.
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:53.800]  Not just dabbing, but any inhalation through the lungs that,
[01:51:53.800 --> 01:51:56.240]  that makes it to the bloodstream incredibly quickly.
[01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:58.480]  You'll get relief in seconds. Yep.
[01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:02.760]  It's it's seconds. And if you eat it, you're looking at, I mean,
[01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:06.760]  half hour, hour, hour and a half, two hours before you've,
[01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:10.440]  you've got full effect of what you've consumed. Um,
[01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:14.520]  the effect of what you eat is going to be a little stronger, but that delayed,
[01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:16.960]  um, if you're taking it for pain,
[01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:21.480]  you can't wait two hours for your painfully kick in. Um, right.
[01:52:22.160 --> 01:52:26.680]  But, uh, CBD was never legal in all 50 States.
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:30.800]  You just called that back like a professional comedian.
[01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:37.680]  It was a loophole that everybody was operating under. And I mean,
[01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:39.880]  it was so glaringly obvious,
[01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:42.880]  a loophole that Chinese companies dove all over it.
[01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:48.480]  And obviously that was going to get shut down at some point.
[01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:52.960]  And that's not even what this was. This was, this was just the, uh,
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:56.080]  DEA assigning it its own serial number for when they do seizures.
[01:52:56.520 --> 01:52:59.320]  They didn't even release a letter saying we're going to go after the people
[01:52:59.320 --> 01:53:01.720]  selling this shit online. Um,
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:06.440]  it's just a reminder that all parts of the cannabis plant are illegal. Uh,
[01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:11.480]  most of our community is still not politically aware, let alone radically active.
[01:53:11.640 --> 01:53:12.480]  That's what we're here for.
[01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:15.280]  That's why I bring you on Mike because you can remind them and you can try to
[01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:19.720]  huge segments. I mean, I mean huge segments of the population,
[01:53:19.720 --> 01:53:23.280]  not just the marijuana community got this story wrong. I mean,
[01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:25.520]  freaked out about it and not,
[01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:29.280]  they're tying it to every conspiracy theory there is against marijuana
[01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:32.640]  legalization. Um, like I read a whole,
[01:53:33.160 --> 01:53:35.680]  on a fairly reputable news site,
[01:53:36.120 --> 01:53:40.360]  it was an opinion piece that they chose to publish about because they use the
[01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:44.320]  marijuana with an H spelling in this, that it was,
[01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:49.360]  that was because Trump was elected and racism is now openly accepted and that
[01:53:49.640 --> 01:53:54.360]  this was an indication that the DEA was going to round up the stoners and the
[01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:59.240]  Mexicans. And this was published in a paper. And I'm reading this like, Oh Jesus,
[01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:04.200]  like we've come so far. We just had a huge night on election night.
[01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:06.920]  Marijuana one big in so many places.
[01:54:07.680 --> 01:54:12.680]  And the first thing we do to celebrate is give ourselves a black eye and then
[01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:18.040]  another and another and another and another and another. I mean,
[01:54:18.040 --> 01:54:21.800]  we didn't need a fake news shit storm this week. Um,
[01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:26.760]  there's enough real news that we should be focused on. Um,
[01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:32.760]  and because so much of our community isn't aware of the legalities nationally,
[01:54:34.160 --> 01:54:39.160]  um, for this plant, we all love this story's spread like wildfire.
[01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:44.600]  I've seen half a dozen businesses down here post it and it's like,
[01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:48.440]  you're a marijuana store. You should have known this better than anyone. Yeah.
[01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:51.320]  Yeah. Um, the businesses,
[01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:54.880]  the CBD businesses that were sending this shit through the mail,
[01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:59.880]  their lawyers should have made this perfectly clear to them that they're
[01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:04.880]  operating in a legal gray area through a loophole in a fucking farm bill.
[01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:07.760]  Um, and that as far as the feds are concerned,
[01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:12.200]  all parts of the cannabis plant are illegal regardless of THC content.
[01:55:12.840 --> 01:55:17.840]  It can be just the root ball of a hemp plant that dried up or was harvested two
[01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:20.240]  years ago. And it's still illegal.
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:24.480]  You can still be charged with a federal crime for having it. Um,
[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:28.760]  that's scary. Yup. And that's, that's just the reality of our situation.
[01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:32.360]  That's why I have so much respect for even the marijuana business owners.
[01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:34.560]  I really hate, um,
[01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:38.080]  because they're standing up and risking a lot for us for everybody.
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:41.040]  Shout out to everyone in the marijuana industry working hard every day,
[01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:44.320]  getting it going. All right. So we've talked a lot about this DEA letter.
[01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:45.360]  It's been a long time.
[01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:47.360]  I hope that clears that up and calms you down.
[01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:51.920]  If you send your hate mail to Nemo bunk 15 or at Pueblo for sensible cannabis
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:52.800]  laws on Facebook.
[01:55:52.800 --> 01:55:56.960]  Yes. And all the positive stuff can grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[01:55:57.480 --> 01:56:00.520]  All right. So, uh, thanks for listening to the DEA part.
[01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:03.600]  We're going to move on to a little bit of updating stuff of things that we've
[01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:07.280]  talked about in the past because, um,
[01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:11.400]  on our post election episode, we mentioned that a, uh, a,
[01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:16.240]  it was the little bit of bad news we had for, for Pueblo for our election night.
[01:56:16.680 --> 01:56:21.680]  There was a, uh, election question. Should we allow retail marijuana stores,
[01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:23.960]  inside Pueblo city limits?
[01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:27.360]  What's that initiative? Is that an initiative? Is that what I voted on?
[01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:28.520]  What's the thing I voted on?
[01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:31.400]  Uh, initiative amendment. There were a couple of,
[01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:34.640]  I think I was trying to remember which one this was.
[01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:38.560]  The question is how I tend to defer to it. We thought it did not pass.
[01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:42.920]  When we recorded our post election show, it was,
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:46.640]  it was failing by like 150 or 200 votes.
[01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:50.440]  And by the time they got all of the provisional ballots counted and all the
[01:56:50.440 --> 01:56:54.160]  ballots that were stuck together and whatnot counted,
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:57.280]  we won by like five or 600 votes.
[01:56:57.320 --> 01:56:58.000]  Nice.
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:03.000]  So we will be able to have recreational cannabis stores within the city limits
[01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:03.920]  of Pueblo.
[01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:09.680]  Um, December 27th, I believe the city council is the Tuesday after Christmas.
[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:15.560]  Um, city council will be voting on the final rules and regs package for recs,
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:17.800]  rec shops.
[01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:19.240]  Um,
[01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:21.160]  they're in a good mood after their Christmas break.
[01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:22.480]  I hope they don't get what they wanted.
[01:57:23.080 --> 01:57:26.000]  Um, unfortunately, uh,
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.360]  I've been involved with this for a long time,
[01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:31.080]  so I know way more about it than I should.
[01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:32.760]  Even the people that are working on it right now,
[01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:35.440]  I probably know more about it than they do. Um,
[01:57:35.480 --> 01:57:39.520]  the ordinance that they're about to vote and probably pass on, uh,
[01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:43.880]  pass into law was written by a zoning commission that was very, uh,
[01:57:43.880 --> 01:57:47.080]  dead set against allowing marijuana businesses in the city at all.
[01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:48.680]  Um,
[01:57:48.960 --> 01:57:53.960]  and at a certain point they discovered that with one or two zoning buffer rules,
[01:57:55.800 --> 01:58:00.440]  so 1000 feet from schools and 300 feet from residences, um,
[01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:03.920]  that they could essentially limit the number of marijuana businesses in the city
[01:58:03.920 --> 01:58:05.800]  to about a dozen. Um,
[01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:08.520]  because that's all the property that's physically available.
[01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:09.360]  That makes sense. Yeah.
[01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:13.920]  Um, if they, they include those two buffer zones and to,
[01:58:13.960 --> 01:58:16.040]  to make that even more restrictive,
[01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:20.360]  they've decided to limit the total number of stores in the city to eight, um,
[01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:23.920]  four North of the river for South of the river. Um,
[01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:25.760]  they've, uh,
[01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:30.320]  the city is preparing for a wave of applications and they've come up with a
[01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:33.520]  point system and a timeline, uh,
[01:58:33.560 --> 01:58:35.560]  for that application process to take place.
[01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:38.000]  So hopefully by the end of the year,
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:41.040]  we've got at least a couple of retail marijuana shops open in Pueblo.
[01:58:41.160 --> 01:58:43.640]  That'd be cool. Um, yeah, I, uh,
[01:58:43.880 --> 01:58:48.000]  I wish the rules were that we're about to pass are different or were different
[01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:52.800]  are different. Um, but, uh, that's very unlikely. Um,
[01:58:52.800 --> 01:58:56.000]  I'm doing what I can to get some of the craziness taken out of them,
[01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:00.360]  but there's only so much, um, change that they're willing to make right now.
[01:59:01.040 --> 01:59:03.600]  They're catching on. They're, they're kind of slowly evolving.
[01:59:04.480 --> 01:59:09.200]  This is a very different city council than the one we had a year or two years
[01:59:09.200 --> 01:59:13.600]  ago. Um, I mean, this is a full process that started four years ago.
[01:59:14.600 --> 01:59:15.440]  Um,
[01:59:15.440 --> 01:59:19.920]  it's been four full years that the city has been working on this particular set
[01:59:19.920 --> 01:59:23.400]  of rules and regs. Um, that's how long I've been working on it.
[01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:25.440]  Do you think since we had the first shop,
[01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:29.120]  do you think we could get just first in line? They're like, Hey, uh, nope.
[01:59:29.560 --> 01:59:34.000]  Can we be back? Um, come on, just play that card. Be like, Hey, we was here.
[01:59:34.040 --> 01:59:38.320]  Most of that part of the city is blacked out due to schools because the thousand
[01:59:38.320 --> 01:59:40.480]  foot from schools rule, um,
[01:59:40.520 --> 01:59:44.560]  isn't just classrooms where there are students. Um,
[01:59:44.600 --> 01:59:49.480]  if the college owns an empty apartment on whatever
[01:59:49.480 --> 01:59:54.080]  street, then there's a thousand foot buffer around that empty apartment, um,
[01:59:54.120 --> 01:59:56.800]  around that empty apartments property line. Yeah.
[01:59:57.720 --> 02:00:02.640]  Does the library in such count? Uh, not for, not for these, this rule package,
[02:00:02.640 --> 02:00:06.440]  but that tends not to matter. Um, uh,
[02:00:07.440 --> 02:00:08.520]  there were, uh, uh,
[02:00:08.560 --> 02:00:13.120]  several other buffer zones listed around our medical shops,
[02:00:13.640 --> 02:00:17.360]  um, which is why they've been allowed with no store cap for four or five years.
[02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:19.920]  And we only have three, um,
[02:00:21.680 --> 02:00:25.920]  I'm with zoning rules. You can really limit the allowed businesses in an area.
[02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:29.840]  And this is why if your area passed legalization recently,
[02:00:30.320 --> 02:00:33.320]  you really need to brush up on local, um,
[02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:37.280]  politics and get down to planning and zoning and city council or county
[02:00:37.280 --> 02:00:38.400]  commission meetings now,
[02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:43.360]  because these rules are being decided for your area right now. Um,
[02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:49.240]  I mean, if you're not involved, people who do give a shit enough to show up,
[02:00:50.120 --> 02:00:52.480]  um, it's their voice that helps craft these rules.
[02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:55.360]  And if it's two people that really hate weed for one reason or another,
[02:00:55.920 --> 02:00:59.920]  and one person that loves weed, but is really an articulate, um,
[02:00:59.960 --> 02:01:01.320]  expect ugly rules.
[02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:05.040]  Yeah. If you know how to grow and you were all about talking with city council,
[02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:07.040]  go down there, represent them, tell them why their,
[02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:10.440]  their guidelines aren't going to work for a typical grow. You know,
[02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:11.720]  I was thinking about it. I think, uh,
[02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:17.080]  I cannot recall buying cannabis in a Pueblo dispensary since
[02:01:17.240 --> 02:01:20.000]  the legalization of recreational cannabis.
[02:01:20.480 --> 02:01:23.160]  That's the last time I can remember shopping in a Pueblo dispensary.
[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:24.600]  I rarely shop in a store.
[02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:29.800]  It's uh, I'm not sure to get out to the stores as often as possible.
[02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:34.280]  Just to see what everybody's doing. But as far as supply goes,
[02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:36.920]  I'm not a lot different than you, buddy.
[02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:40.400]  Well, I know your caregiver and he does a good job. This cascade shatter is,
[02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:43.920]  it's a really nice job. That cough was brought to you by Irish genetics. Yes.
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.480]  Yes. And also our good friends at elevate glass.
[02:01:47.560 --> 02:01:50.960]  And so, uh, that was the good Pueblo news that we screwed up on election night.
[02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:52.840]  That was our big blooper from that show. Yes.
[02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:55.360]  The next thing I've got written down, you can see it. It says Maine.
[02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:56.920]  If you want to tell us about Maine, go for it.
[02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:01.400]  Um, Maine voted to legalize recreational marijuana.
[02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:06.120]  The vote passed by a very, very, very, very slim margin. Um,
[02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:09.800]  like statewide, it was like 1500, 1200 votes or something.
[02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:14.160]  It was very, very close. Um, so the anti-pop people forced a recount,
[02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:18.040]  um, costing the state half a million bucks. Uh,
[02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:23.040]  that recount is underway now it's paused for the weekend. Um,
[02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:28.880]  they've counted all of the cities in a County areas that the anti-pop people
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:33.240]  were sure, um, we're going to give them the numbers to reverse the vote.
[02:02:34.600 --> 02:02:38.160]  Um, and, uh, the, the outcome hasn't changed.
[02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:40.640]  Legalization is still winning. Um,
[02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:44.160]  and the really funny part of the story to me is, uh, so in Maine,
[02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:48.360]  the election rules, if you push for a recount and you get it, um,
[02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:52.240]  the pro side and the anti side for whatever issues getting recounted,
[02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:57.600]  have to send 10 volunteers every day to the recount option office.
[02:02:57.720 --> 02:03:00.880]  Like, you know, it, it still costs the state half a million dollars to do this.
[02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:05.360]  Um, even with using volunteers from the campaigns and, uh,
[02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:10.080]  the anti-pop people in Maine can't get 10 people to show up, um,
[02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:12.960]  every day. And so the, uh,
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.240]  the recounts taken a lot longer than it should have.
[02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:20.560]  Election staffers have had to stand in and cover for, um, uh,
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:25.320]  anti-legalization volunteers that weren't able to make it on time or were late,
[02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:29.480]  um, several days or a couple of days in a row when this first started.
[02:03:29.480 --> 02:03:31.160]  And it just happened again here at the end of the week.
[02:03:31.160 --> 02:03:33.440]  They didn't have enough people show. Um,
[02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:38.040]  luckily the pro pop people have had extra volunteers willing to work,
[02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:39.960]  um,
[02:03:39.960 --> 02:03:42.760]  and have been willing to work some longer hours to make sure that this gets
[02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:46.560]  recounted correctly, correctly and accurately. Um,
[02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:50.040]  so that the recount is still on track to finish up when it's supposed to.
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:55.200]  Um, but the anti-pop people were so convinced that they had this in the bag.
[02:03:55.680 --> 02:03:59.560]  I'm so convinced that they had the majority of people, um,
[02:03:59.760 --> 02:04:01.560]  that they forced the recount and a million,
[02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:04.400]  a half million in taxes to be spent. They can't even get 10 volunteers.
[02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:05.840]  That's funny. Come on now.
[02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:09.360]  How many, uh, how many things are still being recounted nationwide?
[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:14.200]  Um, total election wide. There's a bunch. Um,
[02:04:14.200 --> 02:04:18.680]  but it's all little stuff. Okay. Um, it's statewide issues. Um,
[02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:21.040]  there, well, there aren't that many that are still counting.
[02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:23.360]  Four full weeks, right? Since the election.
[02:04:23.480 --> 02:04:28.320]  Recounting is a huge process cause it's done by hand. And basically,
[02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:32.480]  um, so in Maine, uh, the 10 people from each side pair up,
[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:36.760]  and then they're given an election, um, an election person.
[02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:41.720]  And then those three people go sit at a table and you look at the ballot in
[02:04:42.280 --> 02:04:45.840]  both of the pro and the anti people agree that that's a yes vote.
[02:04:46.640 --> 02:04:50.240]  And the third guy there from the election commission's there to make sure that
[02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:53.760]  the two, the anti and the pro people don't fight. Um,
[02:04:54.120 --> 02:04:58.440]  they play nice and follow the rules. Um, and I mean, this,
[02:04:58.640 --> 02:05:01.520]  it takes an insane amount of time on election night.
[02:05:01.520 --> 02:05:04.800]  They're just funneling these fuckers through a machine and you can do thousands
[02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:06.360]  a minute or thousands a second.
[02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:08.520]  Unless you're Pueblo and then you crash your fucking shitty circuit.
[02:05:09.240 --> 02:05:10.080]  Um,
[02:05:13.880 --> 02:05:17.760]  but, uh, the recount is an incredibly taxing process. Uh,
[02:05:17.800 --> 02:05:21.080]  but there aren't that many that are still going. Um, typically by now,
[02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:24.280]  one side has gone. Okay. The vote clearly hasn't changed.
[02:05:24.600 --> 02:05:27.600]  We're down to just the tiny towns, um,
[02:05:27.640 --> 02:05:31.560]  or the areas that voted strongly one way or the other. Um,
[02:05:31.600 --> 02:05:34.200]  it's not going to matter. Let's, let's let it go.
[02:05:34.240 --> 02:05:38.520]  And they've conceded at this point. Um, the anti pot thing,
[02:05:38.560 --> 02:05:41.400]  or the anti-pot group in Maine is one of the few holdouts that are still
[02:05:41.400 --> 02:05:44.960]  fighting. Um, they don't have a chance. Um,
[02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:48.680]  so what this means if you happen to listen to the podcast and you live in Maine
[02:05:48.680 --> 02:05:53.080]  way, uh, first shout out for listening. We appreciate it. Um,
[02:05:53.080 --> 02:05:57.000]  second get involved locally. Cause in a couple of weeks, um,
[02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:01.680]  when all this is said and done and it's official and marijuana is legal, um,
[02:06:02.320 --> 02:06:03.160]  at best,
[02:06:03.180 --> 02:06:07.080]  you're going to be talking to local government officials who will be saying
[02:06:07.080 --> 02:06:10.200]  over and over and over again, well, the vote was really close.
[02:06:10.480 --> 02:06:13.560]  So we hear what both sides are saying.
[02:06:13.840 --> 02:06:18.000]  We're going to give the anti-pot people nine out of the 10 things they want.
[02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.920]  And we're going to give the pro marijuana people one out of the 10 things they
[02:06:20.920 --> 02:06:22.800]  want because it was a close vote.
[02:06:23.360 --> 02:06:26.600]  And if you don't get on top of it now and figure out exactly how these rules
[02:06:26.600 --> 02:06:29.000]  get made in your area, um, you've,
[02:06:29.600 --> 02:06:33.680]  you're going to be driving a really long distance to the only dispensary in your
[02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:37.240]  area. And it's going to be crazy expensive to buy weed.
[02:06:37.400 --> 02:06:39.120]  If it's Maine, it won't be that far.
[02:06:40.120 --> 02:06:41.160]  It's still cold.
[02:06:41.680 --> 02:06:45.280]  I honestly have no idea exactly how big that state is,
[02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:49.600]  but I don't want to drive 45 minutes to the weed store. No,
[02:06:49.840 --> 02:06:51.720]  I don't want to drive 20 minutes to the weed store.
[02:06:51.880 --> 02:06:54.800]  Then you got to drive 45 minutes home before you can smoke that new weed.
[02:06:55.680 --> 02:06:56.760]  And if there's, I mean,
[02:06:56.760 --> 02:06:58.960]  you just gave me a nostalgic feeling. Remember when he used to go to the
[02:06:58.960 --> 02:07:01.200]  dispensary? I don't have it now. I'm sorry. I'm jaded,
[02:07:02.240 --> 02:07:04.240]  but I remember the feeling. I just took a fat dab. You guys,
[02:07:04.240 --> 02:07:07.000]  I apologize for the chokes. Uh, while Mike was on his rant there,
[02:07:07.080 --> 02:07:08.520]  I took a couple of dabs. Uh,
[02:07:08.720 --> 02:07:11.680]  remember you used to go to the dispensary and you'd be like, Oh, you want one?
[02:07:11.800 --> 02:07:13.120]  Here? I got you, bro. Um,
[02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:15.800]  I've got the hash. If you've got a dab tool, the carb cap,
[02:07:15.840 --> 02:07:19.160]  yeah, you just don't use that email because it's kind of cool.
[02:07:19.160 --> 02:07:23.080]  I used it to be quiet and not use a torch. There's a dab. There's a dabber,
[02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:27.160]  there's a torch and here's a rig with a bucket.
[02:07:27.920 --> 02:07:28.280]  Yes.
[02:07:28.280 --> 02:07:31.040]  Shout out to our friends at elevate for keeping me stocked up on fresh bangers.
[02:07:32.880 --> 02:07:35.440]  And there's garb cap. Remember that feeling when you would go to the, like,
[02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:38.400]  I would, I would do Rob kind of a nerd.
[02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:41.320]  I would do research online and find out what the hottest strains are in Denver
[02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:44.480]  or in Colorado. And I would go find that if it was a Bruce banner,
[02:07:44.480 --> 02:07:46.840]  I'd go find where they had some Bruce banner. Uh,
[02:07:46.880 --> 02:07:49.160]  what was the strain that they had at the Denver relief?
[02:07:49.160 --> 02:07:52.720]  They had the biodiesel owner there and got the biodiesel.
[02:07:53.480 --> 02:07:56.720]  That started with a V the vortex. Yeah.
[02:07:56.720 --> 02:08:00.680]  The vortex that's from TGA sub cool. I was going to, uh,
[02:08:00.720 --> 02:08:05.600]  the clinic on Mexico in Denver and I was getting the vortex
[02:08:05.600 --> 02:08:09.480]  wax and I would say, how much do you have of that? And they'd say this much.
[02:08:09.480 --> 02:08:12.760]  And I'd say, I'll take it. Yeah. They started setting limits because of me.
[02:08:12.760 --> 02:08:14.080]  Started setting purchase limits.
[02:08:14.120 --> 02:08:16.680]  But I remember the first week they put those purchase limits in place.
[02:08:16.680 --> 02:08:19.200]  The girls screwed up when we were there and we still bought it all.
[02:08:19.240 --> 02:08:20.080]  Yeah. Thanks Brittany.
[02:08:21.080 --> 02:08:25.400]  Uh, I remember that was a hookup like a decade ago. We still appreciate it.
[02:08:25.400 --> 02:08:29.520]  Yeah, we do. Uh, that was actually when I bought my hit man rig. But, uh,
[02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:32.200]  so I remember the feeling I would get when I would leave the dispensary with
[02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:35.880]  that specific strain that I was so excited about going to find. It's like,
[02:08:35.960 --> 02:08:36.680]  you're like skipping.
[02:08:36.680 --> 02:08:39.040]  It's like almost the feeling when I was a little kid and I'd get a new video
[02:08:39.040 --> 02:08:42.960]  game whenever the new Zelda or super Mario came out and I'd like, Oh, I got it.
[02:08:42.960 --> 02:08:46.240]  I got to go home and show my friends and you'd go home and call one of your
[02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:48.840]  buddies. And this is the same thing would happen with weed.
[02:08:48.880 --> 02:08:51.800]  You'd go home and call your friends like, bro, Mike, you got to come over.
[02:08:51.800 --> 02:08:54.040]  I got some biodiesel, bro. You got to come check it out.
[02:08:54.040 --> 02:08:58.040]  And you'd drive over and I'd try to keep that jar jar closed until you got here.
[02:08:58.040 --> 02:09:00.480]  So that when I cracked it open, it was just fucking, Oh,
[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:02.160]  biodiesel in the face.
[02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:05.080]  And then we'd grind a little bit of it up and smoke it together.
[02:09:05.080 --> 02:09:09.160]  And it'd be like that anticipation from the car to the house of like, Oh God,
[02:09:09.160 --> 02:09:11.240]  just Mike, meet me at the house. Don't even make me wait, bro.
[02:09:12.160 --> 02:09:16.280]  I missed the drive home from picking up weed for sure. Um,
[02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:21.880]  when that was like an hour and 20 minute drive, that was stressful.
[02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:25.440]  Like by the time you got home, that adrenaline high,
[02:09:27.040 --> 02:09:29.600]  you're not allowed to take more dabs on the show. Yeah, that was,
[02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:31.000]  that was a good one.
[02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:36.240]  But that adrenaline high from driving home with a bag of weed
[02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:39.000]  and then sitting down grinding it up.
[02:09:40.280 --> 02:09:43.840]  It's like the sweet reward. It's like, I finally made it.
[02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:46.360]  And it was like, it was like you, I felt like I almost,
[02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:49.360]  it was more of a reward. I used to get higher than like,
[02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:51.920]  cause you had that like, Oh, I fucking did it. I went,
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:54.800]  cause it used to be a struggle. It used to be a mission, a stoner mission.
[02:09:54.800 --> 02:09:58.720]  You would have to find, do you have weed? There'd be two or three guys.
[02:09:58.720 --> 02:10:00.480]  It'd be that first guy you'd always want to try.
[02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:03.560]  And he was my friend with bad eyes and his name started with a J. If you're,
[02:10:03.560 --> 02:10:05.080]  if you're in my crew, you know what I'm talking about.
[02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:09.040]  Hit that guy up first all the time. See if he's got that sour diesel. If not,
[02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:11.800]  I'd try a couple other dudes, but if you got to find out where they are,
[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.080]  if they got what you want and if they can meet you somewhere,
[02:10:14.080 --> 02:10:16.520]  then you got to meet up somewhere and you got to sit in a sketchy parking lot
[02:10:16.520 --> 02:10:18.960]  or go to a sketchy house and then you got to get it.
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:23.160]  I always had three or four people, but on my way to work,
[02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:27.600]  I would hit up my favorite and my lunch. If I ain't heard back,
[02:10:27.600 --> 02:10:29.920]  I would hit up the other two. Yup. There you go.
[02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:33.560]  By the end of the day, guaranteed one of them would have hit me back.
[02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:37.200]  And then I'd go wait in the sketchy parking lot. Yup. Um,
[02:10:38.040 --> 02:10:39.280]  I don't miss those days.
[02:10:39.400 --> 02:10:41.000]  It was always like, I kind of,
[02:10:41.040 --> 02:10:45.960]  I kind of miss that extra high from the adrenaline and the drive and the
[02:10:45.960 --> 02:10:46.920]  anticipation.
[02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:52.120]  But I feel it every time that I do hit a dispensary now or even,
[02:10:52.760 --> 02:10:57.360]  um, when I come over and, uh, pick up from my caregiver,
[02:10:57.920 --> 02:10:59.320]  when I get back in the car,
[02:11:01.240 --> 02:11:05.600]  there's no like, where am I going to put this process? Right. There's no,
[02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:10.040]  Oh man, this is dank as fuck. Like it was the other day. Um,
[02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:13.680]  when I picked up from my caregiver, the last time when I got in the car,
[02:11:13.680 --> 02:11:18.960]  I was like, is that Nope, that's my bag in inside is a
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:23.840]  proper packaging inside my shoulder bag in the backseat of
[02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:28.960]  my car is still stinking out the whole cab back in the day.
[02:11:28.960 --> 02:11:31.880]  This was, this is when the adrenaline really kicks in.
[02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:33.080]  Yeah.
[02:11:34.240 --> 02:11:35.760]  And drive home in 20 degree weather.
[02:11:35.760 --> 02:11:37.360]  You make that meeting with the dude.
[02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:41.000]  As soon as that bag and money exchanges. Now you're like, fuck,
[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.560]  I just went from like, got to get this, got to find it. Where is it?
[02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:45.440]  Is it going to happen? Is the deal going to go smooth too?
[02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:48.360]  Now I got to get this shit home. Right now.
[02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:51.440]  Or somewhere or to whoever's house we're partying in tonight.
[02:11:51.880 --> 02:11:54.480]  And then you got to make that drive and your heart starts going.
[02:11:56.520 --> 02:11:58.680]  And then you see a cop. All you can do is fucking see a cop.
[02:11:58.720 --> 02:12:02.080]  He could be going the other way, 90 to 90 miles an hour.
[02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:03.360]  And you're like, Oh, fuck the cops.
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:06.480]  And you got to like check yourself and be cool. Yeah.
[02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:09.560]  So by the time you do get home and you start getting that grin, you get it,
[02:12:09.560 --> 02:12:12.160]  you park the car. Cause you're not going to get pulled over.
[02:12:12.160 --> 02:12:15.320]  Once you park the car, you pretty much got home. You take the keys out.
[02:12:15.320 --> 02:12:18.680]  And you're like, Oh, and by the time you unlock the door, you're almost,
[02:12:18.680 --> 02:12:20.760]  you can, your hands start doing the grinder motion.
[02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:23.720]  Like I'm going to grind this weed up. And by the time you light it,
[02:12:23.720 --> 02:12:25.880]  your heart is like in this special place.
[02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:29.600]  And that first puff just puts you like, it's like a mission accomplished.
[02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:31.520]  It's like you just rescued the fucking princess.
[02:12:31.880 --> 02:12:33.680]  That princess was sweet. Mary Jane.
[02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:38.480]  I'm nostalgic for it, but I wouldn't give,
[02:12:38.520 --> 02:12:40.680]  go back to it for all the money in the world.
[02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:44.960]  Like there's nothing that could get me to go back to having to do all that shit.
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.320]  Um, I love getting, I mean,
[02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:51.400]  on the off chance I get pulled over and I've got weed in the car,
[02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:54.280]  I love being in a Vortigaunt. Is there weed in the car? Yep. Yep.
[02:12:54.400 --> 02:12:58.120]  Oh, I got pulled over and the cop was 10 feet from my car before he goes to,
[02:12:58.120 --> 02:13:00.720]  sir, do you have marijuana in there? Cause he could smell it. Yep.
[02:13:00.920 --> 02:13:03.800]  And I just looked him straight in the face and I said, yeah, probably.
[02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:06.240]  There's probably some weed in here. I'm not going to even try to lie.
[02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:09.000]  And he was, once I said yes, that cop was like, cool.
[02:13:09.560 --> 02:13:14.120]  I got pulled over leaving a big production grow that I was trimming at for a
[02:13:14.120 --> 02:13:17.480]  while. And so like,
[02:13:17.920 --> 02:13:19.560]  I didn't have anything on me,
[02:13:19.560 --> 02:13:24.560]  but I probably had like eight or nine grams of just like marijuana juice,
[02:13:24.600 --> 02:13:26.800]  not oil or extract or anything,
[02:13:26.800 --> 02:13:29.920]  but like just the pulp from the family stem,
[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:33.880]  like just in my shoes just soaked in through the bottom.
[02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:38.520]  And I stunk to high heaven because I've been trimming for like 10 hours.
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:42.720]  I was there. We in the car? No, but I work in the industry.
[02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:45.880]  I've been harvesting all day. I understand that I stink to high heaven.
[02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:48.360]  And he was like, what's your all clear? I didn't shit.
[02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:51.800]  So let's just see your badge and your driver's license and your other thing.
[02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:55.040]  Cool. Let me run your, your car information. You're good to have a nice night.
[02:13:55.960 --> 02:13:59.080]  Um, just, just so you know, I can smell you like four cars.
[02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:03.600]  Like behind you. I could, I knew someone in front of me was just stinking.
[02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:07.600]  It's like, yeah, yeah. Sorry. Like sober as a judge.
[02:14:08.200 --> 02:14:10.840]  Working all day harvest time. You can really smell that.
[02:14:10.880 --> 02:14:13.360]  I don't know. Bartender friend has been pulled over several times.
[02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:16.360]  It's like, I swear to God officer, what you're smelling right now is my socks.
[02:14:17.360 --> 02:14:19.920]  I'm sober. I just, I work at a bar.
[02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:24.040]  Oh yeah. I used to hate that as a musician. I wouldn't drink. Like I quit drink.
[02:14:24.040 --> 02:14:26.880]  I was, I did drink it for plenty. Don't, don't get me wrong. I drank fucking plenty,
[02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:27.720]  but I learned not to.
[02:14:28.160 --> 02:14:30.240]  And then you'd be at the club cleaning up or whatever.
[02:14:30.240 --> 02:14:33.080]  And somebody'd spill some beer on you or on your equipment or whatever.
[02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:35.280]  And you're in the car and it just reeks that beer smell.
[02:14:35.720 --> 02:14:39.560]  They'd be driving home like, fuck, I smell like beer. Terrible.
[02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:44.960]  It's it's a, it's so nice that it was literally the only part of my life where I
[02:14:45.040 --> 02:14:47.160]  was way out of whack with legal.
[02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:50.120]  I've actually been kicked out of restaurants or denied service.
[02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:51.840]  They didn't even kick me out. They're just like, no,
[02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:54.800]  why don't you guys go take a shower and come back?
[02:14:56.320 --> 02:14:58.960]  I had someone walk up and they went to do the,
[02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:03.640]  so table for three and they went so take out.
[02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:07.320]  Yeah. Yeah. Carry out at the skirted Heifer in Colorado Springs.
[02:15:07.320 --> 02:15:09.560]  I wasn't going to say the name of a restaurant, but, uh,
[02:15:09.640 --> 02:15:12.640]  and like, I don't blame them. The entire trim crew. Like it was, I,
[02:15:13.160 --> 02:15:14.120]  we were going to dinner,
[02:15:14.120 --> 02:15:16.720]  we were trimming and put down the trim to go to dinner.
[02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:20.040]  It was four of us that were working at caregiver gross. So we like,
[02:15:20.440 --> 02:15:24.120]  we didn't have any of the like protective layering that you wear at a
[02:15:24.160 --> 02:15:27.160]  production facility. So we had like trim mashed into our shoes.
[02:15:27.160 --> 02:15:28.320]  And we stuck to our feet.
[02:15:28.600 --> 02:15:29.280]  At that facility.
[02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:32.760]  We pretty much sat around the table just like this in our t-shirts and shorts
[02:15:32.760 --> 02:15:34.080]  and trimmed with rubber gloves on.
[02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:38.080]  And then we would go smoke at a friend's house because you know,
[02:15:38.080 --> 02:15:40.560]  so don't be at a friend that lived between the grow and downtown.
[02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:43.520]  I just look a stop over there at the apartment, get wrecked.
[02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:46.920]  And then we drove right to the food place and we go like, Hey, we need it.
[02:15:46.920 --> 02:15:49.240]  And they're like, no, you guys are going to eat outside. We're like, what?
[02:15:49.280 --> 02:15:52.320]  And they're like, no, your table is outside guys. And we're like, Oh fuck.
[02:15:52.320 --> 02:15:53.520]  It's like four degrees out here.
[02:15:53.800 --> 02:15:57.000]  So our high ass is all eight outside because they wouldn't let us sit inside
[02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:58.960]  the restaurant. But the place was filled with families.
[02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:02.280]  Like you could see people looking at us offended.
[02:16:02.280 --> 02:16:06.320]  Like I can smell your weed over the burgers in the skirted Heifer and
[02:16:06.320 --> 02:16:07.760]  listeners. Yes, I am a vegetarian.
[02:16:07.760 --> 02:16:10.720]  The skirted Heifer serves a quinoa burger that is marvelous.
[02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:11.840]  So don't get me wrong.
[02:16:12.880 --> 02:16:17.280]  I don't blame restaurants when like, I don't care what you do for work all day.
[02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:21.040]  If you're, if you're funky enough from it to, to funk out a whole restaurant,
[02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:24.160]  you probably shouldn't go straight from work to the restaurant and eat.
[02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:26.320]  Like I don't care what you do or why you stink.
[02:16:29.040 --> 02:16:33.760]  Some restaurants back in the day when I, I noticed before we had legal, uh,
[02:16:33.800 --> 02:16:35.720]  cannabis legalization and it was a known thing,
[02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:38.520]  I would show up to restaurants with my scuzzy looking friends.
[02:16:38.640 --> 02:16:41.560]  Cause I know I'm not the cleanest looking person. I bathe on a regular basis.
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:45.760]  Yes, but I do look like Chewbacca's fucking baby cousin.
[02:16:45.760 --> 02:16:49.560]  I've got dreadlocks past my ass, almost to my knees. I've got a fuzzy beard.
[02:16:49.560 --> 02:16:53.280]  You can hear it. That's my beard. I got a goatee. I got a mustache.
[02:16:53.640 --> 02:16:57.200]  I wore a crooked hat and a t-shirt and Dickies and skateboard shoes.
[02:16:57.520 --> 02:17:00.160]  And I walk into restaurants and back in the day and I smell like weed.
[02:17:00.240 --> 02:17:03.240]  I just constantly smell like herb. If I'm growing it, smoking it, whatever.
[02:17:03.440 --> 02:17:04.600]  I smell like cannabis.
[02:17:05.080 --> 02:17:08.200]  I would walk into restaurants and they would kind of roll their eyes and be like,
[02:17:08.200 --> 02:17:10.040]  fuck, let's sit these weirdos in a corner.
[02:17:10.520 --> 02:17:12.760]  Now that the industry is the way that it is.
[02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:18.160]  They know that kids that look like myself and you and Kev bro and whoever else
[02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:22.000]  used to roll with me to places, they treat us like fucking rock stars. Now, bro,
[02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.880]  when the grimy Gatsby and I would go to dinner in Colorado Springs,
[02:17:25.280 --> 02:17:27.760]  that waitress would be up our butts. Cause they know it's like,
[02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:29.920]  these are weed industry people and they get paid well,
[02:17:29.920 --> 02:17:31.720]  I'm going to be super fucking nice to them.
[02:17:31.760 --> 02:17:34.120]  Not that they get paid well,
[02:17:34.880 --> 02:17:39.880]  they get paid well now and in the near future or in the very recent past,
[02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:46.120]  they worked a job where tips or at least service was a big part of it.
[02:17:46.640 --> 02:17:50.440]  Right. Um, and so when we go out to eat now,
[02:17:50.440 --> 02:17:52.360]  we understand that the person serving us,
[02:17:52.360 --> 02:17:57.360]  our food is making less than minimum wage and that if one or two of her tables
[02:17:58.120 --> 02:18:01.880]  stiffs or throughout a shift, she's going to have trouble making ends meet.
[02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:06.560]  And so if the service is good, we always over tip. Yeah. Yeah. Um,
[02:18:06.600 --> 02:18:09.200]  just as a community, we kind of take care of each, I can always,
[02:18:09.240 --> 02:18:11.280]  when I was doing food service,
[02:18:11.280 --> 02:18:16.280]  I could always tell which one of my tables or which customer is also worked in
[02:18:16.280 --> 02:18:17.080]  the service industry.
[02:18:17.080 --> 02:18:21.040]  I've heard every one of my food service friends has said that before. Yep.
[02:18:21.080 --> 02:18:22.920]  You can always tell. Um,
[02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:26.520]  and you can tell who's like no one in their families worked in the service
[02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:28.080]  industry in a couple of generations,
[02:18:28.360 --> 02:18:33.320]  but you can tell those fuckers too from a mile away. Um, and it, I mean,
[02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:36.560]  it makes a big difference if you're a server, um, to know who to,
[02:18:36.600 --> 02:18:37.920]  to treat a little better.
[02:18:37.920 --> 02:18:40.200]  I love it when you take a girl out to dinner and when the,
[02:18:40.240 --> 02:18:41.160]  when the dinner's over,
[02:18:41.160 --> 02:18:43.640]  she starts gathering plates and sets them at the edge of the table and you're
[02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:47.120]  like, Hey, you're awesome. But you're, you're not at work right now.
[02:18:47.120 --> 02:18:50.000]  You can chill out on it. Yeah. That's so rad to see. Like here,
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.720]  you're fucking awesome. Good work. All right, Mike,
[02:18:52.760 --> 02:18:54.600]  I don't know how we just ended up on this fucking rant.
[02:18:54.600 --> 02:18:59.600]  We're in a random field. Lots of serious and lots of we're high to table.
[02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:03.920]  Join us. Yes. I took a couple of notes that I want to make sure to mention.
[02:19:04.360 --> 02:19:05.920]  Some other bullet points. Let's hit, let's say,
[02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:08.120]  but I'm just going to tease them because we're going to do these in another
[02:19:08.120 --> 02:19:10.480]  podcast. We're not even going to hit them. Yeah. Well, no, well,
[02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:12.760]  we won't do this one tonight, but these are just coming up. Um,
[02:19:13.120 --> 02:19:17.480]  I want to talk about, um, in the future. Uh, somebody,
[02:19:17.480 --> 02:19:19.840]  you touched on earlier and I wrote it down, male selection.
[02:19:20.080 --> 02:19:22.680]  Somebody sent me an email about male selection and you talked about breeding.
[02:19:22.680 --> 02:19:25.200]  We're going to talk about male selection in the very near future.
[02:19:25.240 --> 02:19:29.880]  We're going to talk about the difference between lab testing and how the
[02:19:29.880 --> 02:19:32.440]  cannabis actually works for you. Yeah.
[02:19:32.480 --> 02:19:35.280]  And that reminds me that I want to give another shout out to my friend,
[02:19:35.320 --> 02:19:39.640]  Beau, uh, bone Ellis at the spliff podcast. We talk a lot about growing.
[02:19:39.640 --> 02:19:42.360]  We talk a lot about, uh, cannabis culture.
[02:19:42.640 --> 02:19:46.840]  We do it from sort of a dude bro sort of side of things. Uh,
[02:19:46.880 --> 02:19:50.800]  sorry, we can't help it. No, no, no, no. And I understand that that is,
[02:19:50.800 --> 02:19:53.240]  that's who I am. And I, please don't ask me to change.
[02:19:53.280 --> 02:19:55.800]  But if you're not into the dude bro culture,
[02:19:56.240 --> 02:19:58.800]  dab kids sort of thing that we've got going on here,
[02:19:59.360 --> 02:20:02.520]  bone Ellis has a great podcast called the spliff podcast.
[02:20:02.880 --> 02:20:05.840]  And she does it from a much more, um,
[02:20:06.960 --> 02:20:09.880]  I described it kind of like, is it's learning cannabis from my kindergarten
[02:20:09.880 --> 02:20:10.720]  teacher,
[02:20:10.720 --> 02:20:14.800]  but she's fucking educated and she is learning more and more as she goes on with
[02:20:14.800 --> 02:20:15.360]  the podcast.
[02:20:15.360 --> 02:20:19.960]  She will talk much more about specific cannabinoid dosing for
[02:20:19.960 --> 02:20:21.240]  specific conditions.
[02:20:21.600 --> 02:20:26.680]  And she should call some of her episodes 101 ways to use my cannabis
[02:20:26.680 --> 02:20:30.440]  because I'm all about dabbing, excuse me. I'm all about taking dabs.
[02:20:30.440 --> 02:20:32.560]  I'm all about smoking some flowers. I like some edibles.
[02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:34.680]  Bo doesn't waste a thing.
[02:20:34.880 --> 02:20:38.840]  She uses every bit of cannabinoid that she can pull out of everything.
[02:20:38.840 --> 02:20:40.840]  And I appreciate it. That's just not my style.
[02:20:40.880 --> 02:20:44.200]  I know someone locally that, uh,
[02:20:44.240 --> 02:20:49.040]  there was the first person I ever met that was juicing raw cannabis. Like, uh,
[02:20:49.040 --> 02:20:53.320]  when they defoliate, okay. Take all that leaf material in juice.
[02:20:53.480 --> 02:20:55.920]  As long as it's not crunch, like they toss the crunchy,
[02:20:56.360 --> 02:20:59.160]  but when they defoliate and it's the grain, they,
[02:20:59.160 --> 02:21:01.160]  they juice all that green leaf material.
[02:21:01.240 --> 02:21:03.520]  But she uses the stuff that she's vaporized.
[02:21:03.600 --> 02:21:07.160]  She makes a tincture with coconut oil out of that or a topical with coconut oil
[02:21:07.160 --> 02:21:09.760]  out of that. She makes a cannabis lotion. Uh,
[02:21:09.800 --> 02:21:13.600]  she has been making cannabis products for her cats recently. Like,
[02:21:13.600 --> 02:21:16.640]  so if you guys want a different perspective on cannabis, uh,
[02:21:16.640 --> 02:21:18.680]  if you get tired of hearing our bro culture over here,
[02:21:18.680 --> 02:21:21.480]  which I understand some people aren't into being called dude and bro on the
[02:21:21.480 --> 02:21:23.520]  listening to a podcast all the time, but if you've gotten this far in,
[02:21:23.520 --> 02:21:25.440]  you must be into us. But if you want some more,
[02:21:25.440 --> 02:21:27.480]  a different perspective on cannabis, uh,
[02:21:27.520 --> 02:21:30.120]  from a very well-educated professional sounding woman,
[02:21:30.120 --> 02:21:32.560]  if you want a woman's perspective on cannabis,
[02:21:32.840 --> 02:21:36.080]  I highly recommend listening to the spliff podcast from bone Ellis.
[02:21:36.360 --> 02:21:38.760]  She does not pay me to say that I fucking appreciate the show.
[02:21:40.040 --> 02:21:42.880]  Um, all you gotta do is search for, I'm going to open up my iPhone right here.
[02:21:42.880 --> 02:21:46.280]  Cause it's right here on my podcast screen. It is simply,
[02:21:46.280 --> 02:21:50.200]  I got to get to the top. I'm scrolling. It is because it's spliff.
[02:21:50.360 --> 02:21:54.320]  The spliff as in smoke and pot,
[02:21:54.360 --> 02:21:57.840]  not pod. Right. It took me like a week to find this podcast.
[02:21:57.840 --> 02:22:01.320]  Just cause I was hearing split and pod. Okay.
[02:22:01.320 --> 02:22:04.440]  And I thought it was the split podcast. I was like, this isn't a thing.
[02:22:04.640 --> 02:22:09.840]  Spliff S P L I F F the spliff podcast P O T C A S T.
[02:22:09.840 --> 02:22:13.920]  And her name is Bo B O H Nellis. And she's a great host. Uh,
[02:22:13.920 --> 02:22:17.080]  she's a cool person, but one day I hope we get to take a dab together.
[02:22:17.200 --> 02:22:20.320]  That'd be fun. Uh, I'm going to make you take like a half gram dab.
[02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:24.600]  Make you choke forever. Cause that's how I do it. But you guys,
[02:22:24.720 --> 02:22:27.200]  you would appreciate the show. If you like my show, I feel like you'll like both.
[02:22:27.200 --> 02:22:30.880]  So she is got 63 episodes up right now.
[02:22:31.440 --> 02:22:36.320]  I am 30 something episodes in and they're getting better and better as they go.
[02:22:36.600 --> 02:22:40.040]  She's really good at recommending, uh,
[02:22:40.160 --> 02:22:44.280]  specific dosages of cannabinoids and she's much,
[02:22:45.280 --> 02:22:48.400]  uh, she doesn't over consume cannabis the way that I do.
[02:22:48.440 --> 02:22:51.080]  So she's much more on the, uh,
[02:22:52.200 --> 02:22:55.360]  beginner consumer side, which I, I'm not even bashing anybody.
[02:22:55.360 --> 02:22:57.440]  I miss my lower tolerance. Right.
[02:22:57.440 --> 02:23:01.760]  I was able to do some really amazing things with some low dose cannabinoid
[02:23:01.760 --> 02:23:06.240]  changes. And most of the world is on that spectrum. I'm a little ridiculous.
[02:23:06.240 --> 02:23:10.480]  I'm Chewbacca's freaking cousin and I like to over dab. I like to overmedicate.
[02:23:11.040 --> 02:23:14.080]  Uh, so if you, but that's enough of a shout out for Bo, I support that show.
[02:23:14.080 --> 02:23:15.560]  Listen to it. It's fucking great. I like it.
[02:23:15.560 --> 02:23:17.760]  So that's something that I wrote down. Um,
[02:23:17.800 --> 02:23:22.240]  and then we're going to read an article about particles per million in
[02:23:22.240 --> 02:23:27.040]  Colorado concentrates on one of the next episodes. Yes.
[02:23:27.080 --> 02:23:29.120]  Because I think it's something that needs to be talked about.
[02:23:29.560 --> 02:23:31.040]  You got an hour or two to stick around.
[02:23:31.400 --> 02:23:33.360]  Uh, I don't guess.
[02:23:33.880 --> 02:23:38.400]  That's just, let me just make sure that I, cause we, we kill our phones to do.
[02:23:38.400 --> 02:23:43.520]  We really try to dedicate an hour or more to you guys when we record this.
[02:23:44.080 --> 02:23:46.840]  Um, and then, and part of that involves killing our phones and I have no idea
[02:23:46.840 --> 02:23:47.680]  what time it is.
[02:23:47.880 --> 02:23:51.760]  11 20 PM right now. And it is six degrees outside.
[02:23:54.720 --> 02:23:59.400]  That's a 50 degree or better swing today, folks. Um,
[02:23:59.400 --> 02:24:02.480]  it was nice but windy when I was outside getting shit done earlier. Yeah,
[02:24:02.520 --> 02:24:05.000]  it was a shitty cold a little bit. It got crazy windy.
[02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.360]  We've like semi flipping windy here. All right,
[02:24:07.600 --> 02:24:08.960]  let's put this podcast back on some rails.
[02:24:08.960 --> 02:24:13.240]  We've walked down to a field and sat down and got rid. Yeah, let's, let's know.
[02:24:13.640 --> 02:24:17.240]  Uh, he's hypothetical. There's no PM anywhere. We've been careful this couple.
[02:24:18.520 --> 02:24:23.560]  It's just one of the fun things about Colorado is our weather's psychotic and
[02:24:23.560 --> 02:24:27.040]  that you need to plan your grow for like fucking with you.
[02:24:27.080 --> 02:24:29.440]  I leave to go to this new project I'm going to.
[02:24:29.440 --> 02:24:33.720]  I leave the house around six 30 in the morning and I'm wearing seriously pants
[02:24:33.720 --> 02:24:37.160]  with shorts underneath a t-shirt, a hoodie, a jacket,
[02:24:37.400 --> 02:24:40.520]  a hat that covers up my ears with my dreads down to keep me warm.
[02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:45.200]  I get to where I'm going. I take off the jacket, the hoodie,
[02:24:45.400 --> 02:24:49.520]  that hat I put on a different hat. Uh, then for lunch,
[02:24:49.540 --> 02:24:51.520]  we go to lunch and it's nice and warm outside.
[02:24:51.520 --> 02:24:56.360]  So I put on shorts and skateboard shoes and a t-shirt and tie the hair up and
[02:24:56.380 --> 02:24:57.800]  put a little small dread hat on.
[02:24:57.800 --> 02:25:01.240]  And I wear that for the second half of the day when I leave the facility that
[02:25:01.260 --> 02:25:04.400]  I'm working with, it is little after six.
[02:25:04.680 --> 02:25:08.440]  So then I put on again all of the layers every day and it's cold.
[02:25:08.460 --> 02:25:13.280]  It's colder than, than it was all day. So we run the full weather gamut here.
[02:25:13.320 --> 02:25:16.440]  I mean, daily you get most of the seasons daily.
[02:25:16.480 --> 02:25:19.840]  All the new people that haven't been here for a solid year are sick right now.
[02:25:19.840 --> 02:25:22.840]  They're all, they're all walking around with that head shit going on.
[02:25:23.480 --> 02:25:27.520]  And all the growers that, that moved here, um,
[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:29.000]  from far away and I mean,
[02:25:29.020 --> 02:25:33.360]  even the ones that have been growing cannabis one way or another for years, um,
[02:25:33.480 --> 02:25:35.840]  are just fight for their first two years.
[02:25:35.840 --> 02:25:40.560]  You're trying to figure out how to control for, I mean, every day it's,
[02:25:40.880 --> 02:25:45.520]  it starts out at zero and then it gets to 65 and it's at zero again. Um,
[02:25:45.560 --> 02:25:48.520]  how do I not get PM in this? How do I cure my buds in this?
[02:25:48.760 --> 02:25:51.480]  How do I balance the humidity anywhere? Um,
[02:25:52.280 --> 02:25:56.560]  I watched a guy design like $2 million with a floor heating at one point,
[02:25:57.400 --> 02:26:01.320]  um, to try to combat some of the weather here. Uh, it's just fun.
[02:26:01.320 --> 02:26:04.680]  Watch the way to do it. Different people experiences, especially with, I mean,
[02:26:04.680 --> 02:26:07.520]  we've never seen an influx of people like this. It's crazy.
[02:26:07.520 --> 02:26:11.280]  Traffic is getting shitty. Um, I'm getting people asking me like the,
[02:26:11.280 --> 02:26:13.160]  how the fuck do people survive this?
[02:26:13.160 --> 02:26:17.240]  Questions a lot more highway 53 lanes up there. What happened? All right, guys.
[02:26:19.800 --> 02:26:23.640]  Mike and I are going to turn off some microphones. I love you guys.
[02:26:24.280 --> 02:26:25.800]  And not do all of this to you guys.
[02:26:25.920 --> 02:26:30.040]  I want to thank everybody for listening to episode 171 of the grow from your
[02:26:30.040 --> 02:26:33.840]  heart podcast. That means a lot that you guys listen for 171 episodes.
[02:26:33.880 --> 02:26:36.600]  That's incredible. I keep saying that I'm going to put out some episodes.
[02:26:36.600 --> 02:26:39.400]  Well, thank you. Clint said the same thing today. Shout out to Clint. Um,
[02:26:39.600 --> 02:26:43.000]  I keep saying I'm going to post old episodes. I keep having more content. I don't,
[02:26:43.160 --> 02:26:45.200]  I don't feel the need to post all them, but I'm going to do it.
[02:26:45.200 --> 02:26:48.920]  You guys keep asking for old stuff. Um, all the emails you're sending me,
[02:26:48.920 --> 02:26:51.880]  I am responding to them slowly, but I'm getting to them,
[02:26:51.920 --> 02:26:54.400]  but you wouldn't believe how many emails I get lately. It's Christmas time.
[02:26:54.880 --> 02:26:59.200]  Uh, everybody's trying to sell me shit. So I just keep getting so many emails.
[02:26:59.560 --> 02:27:02.200]  Uh, I'm just writing a note right now. Mike, you're looking at me like,
[02:27:02.200 --> 02:27:04.720]  this is part of the show, but it has nothing to do with this episode.
[02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:09.880]  It's for the future. Um, but I'm getting to all those emails.
[02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:11.360]  Please send me more emails. I love it.
[02:27:11.360 --> 02:27:15.080]  I love making listener generated content that lets me know that I'm getting
[02:27:15.080 --> 02:27:16.640]  something out to at least one person.
[02:27:16.640 --> 02:27:19.040]  And if I'm hitting one person and probably hitting a lot of people,
[02:27:19.080 --> 02:27:22.320]  just one person spoke up from you. Uh, so send me those emails.
[02:27:22.520 --> 02:27:24.760]  That's real from your heart at hotmail.com. I'd love to hear from you.
[02:27:24.920 --> 02:27:26.880]  Make sure you follow Mike on social media.
[02:27:26.880 --> 02:27:28.680]  Mike just took nearly two hours out of his night.
[02:27:28.680 --> 02:27:31.720]  He's going to take a little longer. We may record another episode. Uh,
[02:27:31.760 --> 02:27:33.160]  make sure you follow him on social media.
[02:27:33.160 --> 02:27:38.080]  It's Nemo punk 15 on the Twitter and Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws on
[02:27:38.080 --> 02:27:38.920]  Facebook.
[02:27:38.920 --> 02:27:43.920]  There's a lot of cannabis news that we simply don't have time to work into a
[02:27:44.160 --> 02:27:46.800]  podcast or that, um,
[02:27:47.240 --> 02:27:50.200]  um, is only a minute or two worth of news.
[02:27:51.120 --> 02:27:55.240]  A lot of that stuff gets, I post a ton of that stuff to my, uh,
[02:27:55.280 --> 02:28:00.280]  to my Facebook page every day. Lots of, lots of local cannabis news,
[02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:04.480]  um, national stuff, international stuff. Um,
[02:28:04.520 --> 02:28:07.520]  we were going to talk about it a little tonight and we just kind of went long.
[02:28:07.880 --> 02:28:09.560]  Canada's doing some amazing stuff.
[02:28:09.560 --> 02:28:11.280]  Oh, that's that could be another episode here.
[02:28:11.280 --> 02:28:12.600]  I'll write that down here at the bottom.
[02:28:12.600 --> 02:28:15.720]  I've been posting a lot of stuff about Canada, Tennessee,
[02:28:15.720 --> 02:28:16.560]  get that floppy head.
[02:28:17.320 --> 02:28:21.800]  There's a lot of really awesome marijuana news stories that, uh, um,
[02:28:21.840 --> 02:28:26.840]  we haven't gotten onto the podcast yet that are up on my social media.
[02:28:26.880 --> 02:28:28.520]  So check it out, please.
[02:28:29.080 --> 02:28:31.840]  A couple more things. A couple more things. We're going to wrap this one up.
[02:28:32.280 --> 02:28:33.920]  A Patreon you guys, I would love it.
[02:28:34.080 --> 02:28:38.960]  Patreon is a service that you can go to patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[02:28:39.600 --> 02:28:43.320]  And Patreon is a service that allows you to contribute financially to the
[02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:45.760]  podcast. You guys, I'm not trying to get rich off the podcast.
[02:28:45.760 --> 02:28:48.280]  This show will always be free, free freedom.
[02:28:48.600 --> 02:28:51.200]  I bring you a free podcast because I love you and I love cannabis.
[02:28:51.200 --> 02:28:54.040]  I want you to grow better cannabis. I want cannabis to be legalized.
[02:28:54.720 --> 02:28:58.960]  But what you can do, you can help me pay for the cost of my website.
[02:28:59.080 --> 02:29:02.400]  I read genetics. Colorado is the website where this podcast is hosted.
[02:29:02.680 --> 02:29:06.320]  It costs me a little over $300 per year to keep that website alive.
[02:29:06.680 --> 02:29:09.680]  I am paying for that out of my pocket right now because I love podcasting.
[02:29:09.680 --> 02:29:11.000]  It's something that I've chosen to do.
[02:29:11.320 --> 02:29:14.360]  If you would like to help me with that a little bit, that would be sweet.
[02:29:14.680 --> 02:29:17.040]  I don't want to beg you for it. Patreon is there for that.
[02:29:17.320 --> 02:29:19.880]  Go to patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[02:29:20.280 --> 02:29:25.120]  You can contribute as little as $1 or you can contribute as much as you would
[02:29:25.120 --> 02:29:25.560]  like.
[02:29:25.560 --> 02:29:29.360]  You can sign up for a monthly service to where you can contribute $1 per month.
[02:29:29.400 --> 02:29:31.000]  Then every month on the first of the month,
[02:29:31.280 --> 02:29:35.920]  they'll send $1 to the podcast and that will help me not have to cover all the
[02:29:35.920 --> 02:29:37.480]  costs of the podcast out of my pocket.
[02:29:37.480 --> 02:29:40.200]  Everybody that shows up for the show gets a bottle of water.
[02:29:40.240 --> 02:29:42.440]  I try to buy these little microphone covers, these things here.
[02:29:42.680 --> 02:29:46.000]  I try to replace these quite frequently because you guys cough into them and they
[02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:49.240]  stink and I don't want people having to share that funky shit.
[02:29:49.280 --> 02:29:51.600]  I've made that trip to the store with you. Yes. Yes.
[02:29:51.760 --> 02:29:54.680]  If you're really dying for old content,
[02:29:55.440 --> 02:29:57.640]  this is a way to help make that happen. Ooh.
[02:29:58.400 --> 02:30:02.360]  The reason it's not up there right now is because it would like double or triple
[02:30:02.360 --> 02:30:06.920]  the cost to maintain the web hosting to go all, what are we? 171?
[02:30:07.240 --> 02:30:09.680]  It's 171 now. Yeah. To go 171 deep.
[02:30:09.680 --> 02:30:12.280]  That kind of volume and storage costs a pretty penny.
[02:30:12.360 --> 02:30:15.360]  I don't want to make that promise yet. I've still got to get the,
[02:30:15.360 --> 02:30:19.120]  get the help to cover the original. But yeah, but you know, if somebody did,
[02:30:19.280 --> 02:30:23.880]  if somebody did make the proper Patreon contribution and they said,
[02:30:23.880 --> 02:30:27.680]  post an old episode, asshole, that's the way to get me to do what you want.
[02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:32.240]  Like money fucking talks. It do money talks. It's Christmas time and money talks.
[02:30:32.240 --> 02:30:35.960]  It's all I'm saying. But yeah, but I'm not trying to be that way.
[02:30:35.960 --> 02:30:39.520]  I'm saying $1 goes a long way. If you don't have a dollar to contribute,
[02:30:39.720 --> 02:30:43.480]  I do not. I do. I'm not offended. I still love you. I still want you to listen.
[02:30:43.480 --> 02:30:45.120]  I still want you to grow amazing cannabis.
[02:30:45.520 --> 02:30:49.760]  I do this so that when I'm old and too tired to do this, like on our own,
[02:30:49.840 --> 02:30:52.760]  that I'm hoping that enough people know how to do it well,
[02:30:52.760 --> 02:30:55.520]  that I can just hit a store and buy it at a reasonable price.
[02:30:55.560 --> 02:30:58.960]  That's a good way to look at it. I guess that's all I want is that.
[02:30:58.960 --> 02:31:01.280]  So by the time I'm too old to fight this fight anymore,
[02:31:01.280 --> 02:31:03.680]  that it's taken care of enough for me to just enjoy the ride.
[02:31:03.720 --> 02:31:04.560]  There you go.
[02:31:04.720 --> 02:31:06.960]  All I'm asking for is help paying for the website and buying these little
[02:31:06.960 --> 02:31:09.760]  microphone covers and water bottles. And yeah, that's all.
[02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:11.000]  How about if you can folks?
[02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:14.240]  Patreon.com slash grow from your heart, that would be super awesome.
[02:31:14.240 --> 02:31:17.000]  You guys have got one more super important thing that I need to include in this
[02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:21.240]  episode. This episode comes out on Monday. So that means guess what?
[02:31:21.560 --> 02:31:24.720]  Happy birthday, Miss JB. Jenny Beth, I love you. Hope you have a great birthday.
[02:31:24.760 --> 02:31:27.680]  Hope everything goes your way. Um, yeah,
[02:31:27.720 --> 02:31:29.280]  I think that's all we've got for this episode. Mike,
[02:31:29.280 --> 02:31:30.600]  you got anything else to wrap it up with?
[02:31:32.200 --> 02:31:33.440]  Merry Christmas folks.
[02:31:33.520 --> 02:31:35.520]  Merry holiday, whatever holiday it is.
[02:31:36.040 --> 02:31:40.200]  Yeah. I don't remember what the number is. Tons of them. Um,
[02:31:40.560 --> 02:31:44.600]  Christmas is the next big one in my world, but a happy holidays everybody.
[02:31:44.600 --> 02:31:46.960]  I hope you have a wonderful holiday season and uh,
[02:31:47.680 --> 02:31:50.920]  hopefully we, uh, have another podcast for the first of the year.
[02:31:51.360 --> 02:31:52.200]  Oh, we'll get it. We're going to,
[02:31:52.200 --> 02:31:54.760]  they're going to hear from us again before Christmas. This one comes out,
[02:31:54.760 --> 02:31:57.760]  love it. 18th 19th. So then that means we got seven.
[02:31:58.080 --> 02:32:00.720]  It might be, I had completely forgotten about it in my world.
[02:32:00.720 --> 02:32:04.200]  It's not Christmas until I eat a specific type of Christmas cookie that a family
[02:32:04.240 --> 02:32:07.880]  member makes. And I don't like, it's just a thing in my world.
[02:32:07.920 --> 02:32:08.760]  I went to hobby lobby.
[02:32:08.760 --> 02:32:11.880]  That hasn't happened yet. So as far as I'm concerned, it's like August.
[02:32:12.840 --> 02:32:16.080]  The holidays are far, far away because I haven't had that cookie yet.
[02:32:16.400 --> 02:32:19.400]  We'll be joining everybody the day after Christmas. So Merry Christmas,
[02:32:19.400 --> 02:32:22.680]  everybody. Happy holiday. Happy Hanukkah, whichever one it is you're celebrating.
[02:32:22.680 --> 02:32:24.840]  I'm not sure what all of them are. I don't want to sound offensive,
[02:32:24.840 --> 02:32:26.400]  but have a great holiday season.
[02:32:26.400 --> 02:32:28.560]  Eat some good food with your friends and family. Uh,
[02:32:28.560 --> 02:32:31.760]  if you don't have some friends and family, uh, go to my Facebook page,
[02:32:31.880 --> 02:32:35.280]  send me a message. We'll fucking chat down like that. We'll have some fun.
[02:32:35.560 --> 02:32:38.360]  Tell me what's up. Don't send me pictures of your food, please.
[02:32:39.440 --> 02:32:42.440]  We all eat the same shit. No, I'm not. That's the thing. I'm a vegetarian.
[02:32:42.440 --> 02:32:45.120]  I'm not. All right. We're going to wrap this episode up. Uh,
[02:32:45.160 --> 02:32:47.200]  hashtag they like it when we ramble.
[02:32:47.520 --> 02:32:50.840]  I'm so glad they like it when we ramble because dabs.
[02:32:51.280 --> 02:32:53.560]  Because dabs. I want to thank everybody once again for listening.
[02:32:53.560 --> 02:32:56.560]  I want to give a huge shout out to miss Jenny Beth. And until next time,
[02:32:56.560 --> 02:32:59.120]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[02:33:02.160 --> 02:33:03.160]  It's your birthday.
[02:33:05.160 --> 02:33:08.000]  Look at your birthday cake. It's your birthday today.
[02:33:08.720 --> 02:33:09.760]  It's your birthday.
[02:33:17.760 --> 02:33:21.280]  He can't read. So he does not know that the cake is not for him.
[02:33:22.080 --> 02:33:25.640]  It might be his birthday too, but the chance of that is slim.
[02:33:26.160 --> 02:33:27.640]  It's your birthday today.
[02:33:28.360 --> 02:33:29.360]  It's your birthday.
[02:33:30.360 --> 02:33:31.200]  There's a cat.
[02:33:32.640 --> 02:33:34.120]  It's your birthday today.
[02:34:03.960 --> 02:34:06.440]  Welcome back. It's time for episode number one,
[02:34:06.440 --> 02:34:10.680]  72 of the grow from your heart podcast, your source for cannabis news,
[02:34:10.720 --> 02:34:13.920]  education, and conversation. Right? If you're a new grower,
[02:34:13.960 --> 02:34:17.360]  if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[02:34:17.760 --> 02:34:19.000]  if you're a cannabis activist,
[02:34:19.040 --> 02:34:22.000]  or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[02:34:22.400 --> 02:34:26.160]  this, my friends is the podcast for you. I'm your host, my friends,
[02:34:26.160 --> 02:34:29.560]  call me Ross to Jeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me as always.
[02:34:29.600 --> 02:34:30.640]  I want to send a huge thank you.
[02:34:30.640 --> 02:34:33.600]  Shout out to my friends in the mystic roots band for letting me use their music
[02:34:33.600 --> 02:34:35.960]  on my podcast. Big shout out to Kat,
[02:34:36.680 --> 02:34:41.480]  the entire mystic roots crew, ladies and gentlemen, white Mike is back.
[02:34:41.520 --> 02:34:45.280]  Welcome to the table. Mike. If you guys want to follow Mike on Twitter,
[02:34:45.280 --> 02:34:49.200]  that'd be awesome. He is at Nemo punk 15 on Twitter. Give him a follow.
[02:34:49.200 --> 02:34:51.760]  Let him know that you learned about him through the grow from your heart
[02:34:51.760 --> 02:34:55.000]  podcast. Also check out Mike's Facebook page.
[02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:58.400]  It's Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws. Make sure you check that out.
[02:34:58.800 --> 02:35:01.880]  He would appreciate that. I've been, I've been trying to remember that.
[02:35:01.880 --> 02:35:04.080]  It's a lot of words. It's a lot of mouthfuls of words.
[02:35:04.360 --> 02:35:07.240]  When I put that name up there, I had two or three people go like too many words.
[02:35:07.320 --> 02:35:10.440]  Yeah. It's like, well, I needed it. It's what it is.
[02:35:10.440 --> 02:35:13.640]  It's Pueblo for sensible cannabis. It's as succinct as I could make it.
[02:35:13.640 --> 02:35:16.320]  Exactly. It's to the point. If you've been listening to the show, you know,
[02:35:16.320 --> 02:35:18.080]  succinct isn't really my wheelhouse.
[02:35:18.160 --> 02:35:22.080]  That's why I say that this show is the grow from your heart podcast.
[02:35:22.080 --> 02:35:25.280]  It's cannabis news, education, and conversation. Uh,
[02:35:25.320 --> 02:35:28.240]  because if you're looking for the Nike collector podcast,
[02:35:28.240 --> 02:35:30.400]  this obviously is the wrong shit. I like to put it right out there,
[02:35:30.400 --> 02:35:31.240]  right at the beginning.
[02:35:31.360 --> 02:35:34.080]  It's perfect. It tells you exactly what you're about to get. Yeah.
[02:35:34.080 --> 02:35:35.240]  There's truth in advertising.
[02:35:36.200 --> 02:35:37.880]  Here's something that sounds good in that intro.
[02:35:37.880 --> 02:35:39.160]  You might want to find another show.
[02:35:39.200 --> 02:35:42.680]  Yes. If you're looking for fun with boats or fun with maps,
[02:35:42.680 --> 02:35:48.640]  this might not be the show for you. The look on your face is priceless, bro.
[02:35:48.680 --> 02:35:52.920]  None of the examples for shows that went through my head were so family
[02:35:52.920 --> 02:35:55.920]  friendly. Well, you know, I'm trying to be friendly, friendly here. I like it.
[02:35:55.920 --> 02:35:56.880]  So make sure you support Mike.
[02:35:56.880 --> 02:35:58.800]  That's what I'm trying to do is get people to follow my care.
[02:35:58.800 --> 02:36:02.520]  Fable punk 15 on Instagram, Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws on Facebook.
[02:36:02.520 --> 02:36:05.360]  And of course I would love it. If you'd follow me on, let's see,
[02:36:05.360 --> 02:36:08.520]  we'll start off with on Twitter. I said Instagram a second ago,

[02:36:25.080 --> 02:36:29.520]  IRI is a Jamaican word. It means to feel as blessed as you could feel.
[02:36:29.520 --> 02:36:33.360]  You know that feeling I describe it as like you're sitting under a tree and the
[02:36:33.360 --> 02:36:35.280]  weather is just right. It's kind of sunny,
[02:36:35.280 --> 02:36:37.720]  but there's a little bit of breeze and that grass is nice and cool.
[02:36:38.200 --> 02:36:43.200]  And either your significant other or your best friend or your dog is sitting
[02:36:43.680 --> 02:36:46.840]  right next to you and you don't got to worry in the fucking world.
[02:36:46.840 --> 02:36:50.680]  Everything is just right. You're feeling IRI. Everything is perfect.
[02:36:51.640 --> 02:36:55.400]  So IRI, IRI genetics, it's just feeling good. It's the most pleasing,
[02:36:55.920 --> 02:36:59.440]  comfortable feeling you could get this feeling. All right. Everything be IRI.
[02:36:59.560 --> 02:37:02.360]  I'm good. So IRI genetics, you guys follow me there on Instagram.
[02:37:02.680 --> 02:37:04.760]  I posted a whole bunch of great cannabis photography.
[02:37:04.760 --> 02:37:08.600]  I post pictures of myself with famous comedians, post pictures of male plants.
[02:37:08.600 --> 02:37:11.440]  Not a lot of weed growers and breeders are posting pictures. They're males.
[02:37:11.720 --> 02:37:13.880]  I put pictures of King Solomon up there all the time.
[02:37:13.960 --> 02:37:16.840]  I think you would appreciate it. It'd be a good time.
[02:37:17.120 --> 02:37:19.360]  So you think I covered all of the social media outlets? Oh,
[02:37:19.360 --> 02:37:20.760]  if you want to contact me, there you go.
[02:37:20.760 --> 02:37:24.920]  You can hit me up at grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:28.600]  If you've got questions or comments or concerns, I'd love to hear from you.
[02:37:28.640 --> 02:37:30.320]  Lance for all that stuff. We'll handle it. Mike,
[02:37:30.320 --> 02:37:32.760]  you got a shitty grin on your face, bro. What's going on over there?
[02:37:33.120 --> 02:37:36.400]  Oh, there's, it's just, there's so much now. Oh, there is a lot of,
[02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:38.920]  I just had a little flashback to, it was like,
[02:37:39.200 --> 02:37:41.960]  how do you get ahold of me? And you had two options.
[02:37:42.520 --> 02:37:45.040]  Are you going to give them your address or your phone number? Right.
[02:37:45.160 --> 02:37:47.760]  And now it's like, well, I have 36 different ways.
[02:37:47.760 --> 02:37:52.760]  You can get ahold of me on social media and the old school ways doesn't,
[02:37:52.840 --> 02:37:53.680]  don't matter anymore.
[02:37:53.760 --> 02:37:57.080]  Well, but now there's no way to duck in anybody like, right.
[02:37:57.080 --> 02:37:59.960]  Cause they can, they can see that you tweeted. Why didn't you call me back?
[02:37:59.960 --> 02:38:03.000]  I see you tweeting, right? If you're tweeting, you had time to text.
[02:38:04.080 --> 02:38:06.080]  I see you up on Snapchat showing that you're at the mall.
[02:38:06.080 --> 02:38:09.080]  You might be in a meeting, but like, if you can tweet from the meeting,
[02:38:09.080 --> 02:38:11.600]  you can text me back from the meeting. Come on now. Yeah.
[02:38:11.640 --> 02:38:16.480]  I do have a lot of contact or if it shows you this message was seen at two 45
[02:38:16.920 --> 02:38:19.640]  like, and it's four 45 now. Why haven't I heard back?
[02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:24.240]  That was a question motherfucker. Like you can't duck anybody now.
[02:38:24.280 --> 02:38:27.120]  No social media has got us on lock. You gotta be accountable.
[02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:30.880]  If you're on a podcast and if you're on more than one podcast and you're out
[02:38:30.880 --> 02:38:31.880]  there like a lot of people are,
[02:38:32.120 --> 02:38:34.960]  you are accountable for what you say because people will point out that you've
[02:38:34.960 --> 02:38:39.400]  made indiscrepancies. You said this and this bro, and you're like, God damn,
[02:38:40.080 --> 02:38:42.520]  I wasn't a lie. I got the date wrong. Cause I'm high. I'm sorry.
[02:38:42.560 --> 02:38:45.200]  The first time it hit me, somebody who came up to me in public and was like,
[02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:50.040]  are you white? Mike? I turned around and was like, huh? And I was like, wait,
[02:38:50.040 --> 02:38:54.040]  you recognize me from across the store by my, oh fuck. Oh yeah.
[02:38:54.040 --> 02:38:59.040]  Like I need to think before I speak a little bit, a little bit more sometimes,
[02:38:59.040 --> 02:38:59.880]  but yeah,
[02:38:59.960 --> 02:39:03.280]  I was at one love garden supply one time talking to burn big shout out to burn.
[02:39:03.560 --> 02:39:07.400]  And there was a normal shopper in there and he paused and he looked at me and I
[02:39:07.400 --> 02:39:08.400]  go, what's up man? Cause he was,
[02:39:08.400 --> 02:39:11.240]  he like obviously looked at me and stopped like what the fuck?
[02:39:11.240 --> 02:39:14.040]  And I was like, what dude? And I was cool about it. I was like, what's up man?
[02:39:14.040 --> 02:39:16.920]  He's like, you, do you have a podcast? I was like, that's totally me, bro.
[02:39:16.920 --> 02:39:19.040]  And he's like, I recognized you by your voice. And I was like,
[02:39:19.040 --> 02:39:20.400]  that's fucking funny. So yeah,
[02:39:20.920 --> 02:39:24.360]  there are people listening that recognize us by our marvelous, sexy voices.
[02:39:24.360 --> 02:39:28.000]  I ran into someone last night actually that recognized me from my city council
[02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:31.960]  stuff because that's broadcast on live TV. And she goes, I know you.
[02:39:32.040 --> 02:39:36.920]  And I was like, Oh, from, and she goes, you were on TV at my grandpa's house.
[02:39:38.040 --> 02:39:41.920]  I just started laughing cause there's a whole bunch of the, um,
[02:39:42.040 --> 02:39:43.000]  the segment of this,
[02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:47.960]  the senior citizens down here in Pueblo that watch a lot of local government
[02:39:47.960 --> 02:39:49.360]  public access television.
[02:39:49.360 --> 02:39:53.840]  And a lot of them really like me cause I go and give city council shit. Um,
[02:39:54.600 --> 02:39:56.960]  and for a while I was doing it about a whole bunch of issues.
[02:39:56.960 --> 02:40:00.960]  And so I've got this weird geriatric fan base that loves me. That's creepy.
[02:40:00.960 --> 02:40:04.600]  But I wasn't aware of it until I was eating lunch one day and I had two senior
[02:40:04.600 --> 02:40:07.440]  citizens come up and be like, are you the guy that goes to city council?
[02:40:07.440 --> 02:40:08.480]  You look like the guy.
[02:40:09.880 --> 02:40:12.120]  Have you ever gotten, are you the guy on the paper smoking weed?
[02:40:12.200 --> 02:40:13.840]  Are you the guy in the news that was smoking weed?
[02:40:14.240 --> 02:40:17.280]  Um, only from family. Um, I have,
[02:40:17.760 --> 02:40:20.600]  I'm from Southern Colorado, not quite this Southern,
[02:40:20.640 --> 02:40:24.400]  but I have family friends throughout the state. Um,
[02:40:24.400 --> 02:40:26.680]  a bunch of people up in monument, oddly enough,
[02:40:27.200 --> 02:40:31.760]  and they see our city government stuff and they see a lot of our press.
[02:40:31.800 --> 02:40:35.680]  Okay. And so they would call further up North to my parents. Like,
[02:40:35.680 --> 02:40:37.120]  do you want to, do you know what your son's doing?
[02:40:37.120 --> 02:40:39.600]  And my dad's like, he's in his thirties. What the fuck am I going to do about it?
[02:40:39.640 --> 02:40:43.160]  Right. Um, but then I would get the phone call from my, uh,
[02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:45.920]  my folks saying like, Hey, you know, at so-and-so, yeah,
[02:40:45.920 --> 02:40:49.520]  she saw you on the news. Um, what was that you were doing? Dabbing?
[02:40:49.760 --> 02:40:52.400]  Yeah. Yeah. Uh, so Mike and I,
[02:40:52.640 --> 02:40:57.560]  I happen to be the first person to buy recreational cannabis in the
[02:40:57.560 --> 02:40:59.200]  County of Pueblo, Colorado.
[02:40:59.200 --> 02:41:01.720]  When we legalized the sale of recreational cannabis.
[02:41:01.760 --> 02:41:06.800]  Photos of the line Jeff got to be first in are still used all
[02:41:06.800 --> 02:41:09.720]  the time in national press stories about legalization.
[02:41:10.120 --> 02:41:12.720]  There's two photos that were taken that day in Pueblo.
[02:41:13.360 --> 02:41:17.880]  They're both aerial shots in Jeff is shopping while that photo was being taken.
[02:41:17.880 --> 02:41:22.400]  Yeah. First. So I'm in there buying this stuff. But, uh, those are,
[02:41:22.600 --> 02:41:26.160]  I mean, this has been years now and that's, I saw it on NBC like a week ago.
[02:41:26.720 --> 02:41:29.800]  That's where I'm headed is, uh, I was first. And so I,
[02:41:30.040 --> 02:41:33.240]  I've got a picture of myself actually purchasing cannabis,
[02:41:33.240 --> 02:41:35.600]  like the money transaction of handing him money.
[02:41:35.920 --> 02:41:38.120]  And then the owner of the dispensary is a good friend of mine.
[02:41:38.120 --> 02:41:39.720]  So I shook his hand like, thanks, bro.
[02:41:39.760 --> 02:41:41.480]  I'm glad that I could be your first customer.
[02:41:41.480 --> 02:41:45.200]  I'm proud of you for having this fucking landmark or milestone.
[02:41:45.680 --> 02:41:47.120]  I shook his hand, told him, thank you.
[02:41:47.520 --> 02:41:49.840]  I turned around to my other friends at work and I said, thanks guys.
[02:41:49.840 --> 02:41:52.280]  And I grabbed my stuff and I left. And when I walked outside,
[02:41:52.760 --> 02:41:57.760]  I was interviewed by eight news stations and documentary makers and
[02:41:57.840 --> 02:42:00.440]  documentarians, I guess, but there were a lot of cameras around me.
[02:42:00.920 --> 02:42:02.800]  I'm really glad that I'm a well-spoken dude,
[02:42:02.800 --> 02:42:05.560]  because that would have been overwhelming for the most normal people.
[02:42:05.720 --> 02:42:10.040]  That was crazy. But a lot of that footage. So also that day,
[02:42:10.080 --> 02:42:12.760]  there was a newscaster there who I ended up making friends with.
[02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:15.960]  And she was like, Hey, we're looking for,
[02:42:16.160 --> 02:42:19.600]  they actually asked me if I could smoke there. They're like, can you roll up?
[02:42:20.640 --> 02:42:21.480]  She didn't know what to call it.
[02:42:21.480 --> 02:42:24.200]  She's like, can you roll a cigarette and smoke it here with your friends so that
[02:42:24.200 --> 02:42:27.200]  we can film that? And I was like, actually, that's highly illegal.
[02:42:27.200 --> 02:42:29.120]  I can't smoke in front of my friend's facility.
[02:42:29.840 --> 02:42:34.200]  And we put a little plan together and I was like, let's go to my house.
[02:42:34.280 --> 02:42:36.720]  Well, it's all meet at my house at one o'clock and smoke.
[02:42:37.240 --> 02:42:42.240]  And so I drove here with Mike joined me and our friend Wade came and we came
[02:42:42.680 --> 02:42:45.560]  here and kind of put, uh, we did some prop placing.
[02:42:45.560 --> 02:42:48.120]  We put some product placement happened and there were a couple of packs of
[02:42:48.120 --> 02:42:49.640]  ivory genetic seeds on the table.
[02:42:49.640 --> 02:42:50.520]  We had fun with it. We,
[02:42:50.560 --> 02:42:54.800]  we set up some really nice shots for them to get in.
[02:42:55.960 --> 02:43:00.960]  We didn't think about the optics of it necessarily from people who aren't from,
[02:43:01.680 --> 02:43:04.680]  because we were used to dabbing by then.
[02:43:04.680 --> 02:43:08.120]  We were used to the equipment that goes with it.
[02:43:08.120 --> 02:43:10.280]  Um, the parts, the process,
[02:43:10.280 --> 02:43:15.280]  the people that came over to interview us and see this little session,
[02:43:15.280 --> 02:43:18.240]  none of them were familiar with this at all.
[02:43:18.240 --> 02:43:19.320]  They had never seen a dab.
[02:43:19.320 --> 02:43:22.240]  Um, the one lady, so there was a cameraman,
[02:43:22.240 --> 02:43:26.240]  there was a news reporter who was from the TV news and then there was a right,
[02:43:26.240 --> 02:43:27.320]  a newspaper writer.
[02:43:27.440 --> 02:43:31.440]  Hinted, mentioned, talked about cannabis, that she liked cannabis.
[02:43:31.440 --> 02:43:34.960]  She wanted to say she was saying without saying,
[02:43:34.960 --> 02:43:36.960]  I'd love to fucking smoke that bull with you guys,
[02:43:36.960 --> 02:43:40.080]  but all these assholes right here would snitch on me is what she was saying.
[02:43:40.080 --> 02:43:45.080]  Um, and we did our best to completely hotbox basically a suburban home.
[02:43:46.400 --> 02:43:49.360]  Yeah. Um, and it didn't take much with three grown men here.
[02:43:49.360 --> 02:43:49.720]  Yeah.
[02:43:49.720 --> 02:43:54.720]  And we did our best to completely hotbox basically a suburban home.
[02:43:55.240 --> 02:43:57.120]  And it didn't take much with three grown men here.
[02:43:57.360 --> 02:44:01.600]  Yeah. And the 20, 30 minutes they were here filming and interviewing people.
[02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:07.000]  We nonstop had a dab rig and a bowl in a joint going around the table so that it
[02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:10.520]  won in any given moment, one of us was hitting everything.
[02:44:10.600 --> 02:44:14.680]  I thought that camera was going to touch me. I was taking a dab, a big dab.
[02:44:14.680 --> 02:44:17.880]  I was worried about his, his lens at one point he got really,
[02:44:17.880 --> 02:44:22.280]  really close to the nail. And I was like, bro, that's like a couple hundred degrees.
[02:44:22.520 --> 02:44:24.560]  You really don't want to get any closer.
[02:44:24.600 --> 02:44:26.280]  But that, that shot,
[02:44:26.280 --> 02:44:30.800]  that actual shot is shown on the news all the time. So frequently when they talk
[02:44:30.800 --> 02:44:34.200]  about marijuana, they show me take a big dab and blow it out. Like, Oh,
[02:44:34.200 --> 02:44:39.200]  I feel relieved. Yeah. So I'm sure that that is interesting.
[02:44:39.680 --> 02:44:43.400]  So luckily they don't use me taking a dab, um,
[02:44:43.480 --> 02:44:45.560]  nearly as frequently as they use you,
[02:44:45.960 --> 02:44:50.280]  but they still use that footage regularly. And it's been years now that footage.
[02:44:50.280 --> 02:44:53.880]  We saw, we agreed that that footage can be used in anything.
[02:44:53.880 --> 02:44:57.560]  It's like either ABC or NBC is what news organization that was for.
[02:44:57.560 --> 02:44:58.720]  So it's theirs now.
[02:44:59.160 --> 02:45:02.280]  And so it's shown all over the nation when they talk about cannabis.
[02:45:02.280 --> 02:45:05.960]  And I get messages from people all over like, Hey, I just saw you on my news.
[02:45:05.960 --> 02:45:07.760]  What the hell? I'm like, yeah,
[02:45:08.120 --> 02:45:13.120]  task rock actually sent me a gift because his email was on the news.
[02:45:13.400 --> 02:45:15.560]  He's like this guy right here, got an email on the news.
[02:45:15.560 --> 02:45:18.080]  He's hitting the email on the news and he sent me a gift.
[02:45:18.080 --> 02:45:20.840]  I thought it was pretty cool. Yep. Um,
[02:45:22.920 --> 02:45:25.800]  Colorado affords us a lot of fun little opportunities.
[02:45:26.120 --> 02:45:29.920]  I've been on the news taking a dab in my kitchen, my dining room here at this
[02:45:29.920 --> 02:45:32.880]  table, at this dab table. This was, I was sitting,
[02:45:32.920 --> 02:45:35.960]  I'm sitting now where I was sitting then. I of course am, I have this,
[02:45:35.960 --> 02:45:38.520]  I've got the Sheldon Cooper OCD where this is my seat,
[02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:44.000]  but it's where the controls are. It has to be, I'd go nuts without it.
[02:45:44.240 --> 02:45:46.480]  You guys, there's going to be a point to this podcast.
[02:45:46.480 --> 02:45:49.600]  We're 12 minutes in and I haven't even told you what the topic is.
[02:45:49.680 --> 02:45:53.120]  Should we mention that the goal was very little rambling for this show?
[02:45:53.160 --> 02:45:54.520]  Yeah, I did say let's kind of keep it.
[02:45:55.880 --> 02:45:58.720]  I love you guys. And I haven't even done the ad I'm supposed to do.
[02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:00.120]  You guys are wonderful.
[02:46:00.120 --> 02:46:03.920]  Thank you so much for supporting the podcast and listen to our high asses
[02:46:03.920 --> 02:46:07.760]  ramble. We love you and we love that you love us. You know who else I love?
[02:46:08.400 --> 02:46:11.080]  I love my friends at handmade apparel. My friends at handmade apparel.
[02:46:11.360 --> 02:46:13.920]  They keep me stocked with dope ass t-shirts and dope hoodies.
[02:46:14.440 --> 02:46:18.600]  Yeah, right, right. You're the second person I saw leaving here now.
[02:46:18.640 --> 02:46:22.960]  Grow from your heart podcast hoodie and another person left here in a red
[02:46:23.600 --> 02:46:27.320]  handmade apparel hoodie with a big white logo on it. It looks really good on her.
[02:46:27.840 --> 02:46:31.520]  It's I'm at that age where I don't care what your brand is.
[02:46:32.120 --> 02:46:36.520]  If your logo isn't hideous and it's a really good quality item, I'm in.
[02:46:37.880 --> 02:46:41.280]  That's what I like about handmade is it's really, really high quality stuff.
[02:46:41.280 --> 02:46:44.000]  They get, but they get you the best hoodies they can start with.
[02:46:44.080 --> 02:46:47.960]  I think they're the gildan there. It's snuggly. It's super cozy.
[02:46:47.960 --> 02:46:50.200]  Like when you put it on, you're like, Oh yeah, it was cozy.
[02:46:50.480 --> 02:46:53.600]  It's so snuggly and I'm a big dude and I feel all cozy in it. So that's weird.
[02:46:53.960 --> 02:46:58.240]  And then the printing quality that these guys do. Uh, my logo of course is red,
[02:46:58.240 --> 02:47:00.560]  yellow, green, there's white in there, there's black.
[02:47:00.600 --> 02:47:04.120]  And then there's like a skin tone and then there's whatever color they call that
[02:47:04.120 --> 02:47:05.480]  for my dreadlocks that they use.
[02:47:05.840 --> 02:47:09.400]  There are like nine colors and the color of this design that they made for me.
[02:47:09.840 --> 02:47:13.760]  And every single color pops, it all pops. I got your back bro. You're cool.
[02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:16.800]  Mike just freaked out cause he turned to look at the hoodies and I felt the
[02:47:16.800 --> 02:47:21.800]  headphone cord snag. And then I heard the rig move in that mini heart attack.
[02:47:22.200 --> 02:47:25.720]  I moved it. I was watching out for my rig. I moved it for you.
[02:47:25.800 --> 02:47:28.840]  There's no, no glass spillage here, but these hoodies look wonderful. You guys,
[02:47:28.840 --> 02:47:30.320]  I'm not just trying to sell you my hoodies.
[02:47:30.560 --> 02:47:34.320]  Handmade apparel can make your hoodies hand Merrill handmade apparel can make
[02:47:34.360 --> 02:47:38.360]  your t-shirts handmade. Let me slow down and say this in English, you guys,
[02:47:38.360 --> 02:47:40.720]  because I want to get this right for my friends because they do a lot of good
[02:47:40.720 --> 02:47:42.760]  hard work for me and I owe them the proper ad.
[02:47:43.160 --> 02:47:47.080]  My friends at handmade apparel can make your t-shirts and your hoodies and your
[02:47:47.080 --> 02:47:50.040]  stickers and your happens. They can help you with the artwork.
[02:47:50.320 --> 02:47:53.560]  They can get your stuff to you in a timely manner. They're good people.
[02:47:53.600 --> 02:47:57.960]  They support the cannabis industry. They are dab kids. Uh, they're my friends.
[02:47:58.040 --> 02:48:01.120]  So there's no reason why you should not shop with handmade apparel.
[02:48:01.280 --> 02:48:04.680]  All you gotta do, all you've got to fucking English is hard to do. You guys,
[02:48:04.680 --> 02:48:06.920]  I'm gonna either take another dab or something to figure this out.
[02:48:06.920 --> 02:48:11.280]  All you've got to do is go to handmade apparel.biz and check them out. Uh,
[02:48:11.560 --> 02:48:15.240]  tell them that Rasta Jeff from the grow from your heart podcast sent you and they
[02:48:15.240 --> 02:48:18.960]  will hook you up with the best deal possible to get your products printed. Uh,
[02:48:19.080 --> 02:48:21.240]  I think they've got a 25 piece minimum,
[02:48:21.440 --> 02:48:24.960]  so they'll charge you for 25 pieces plus a small setup fee because they do have
[02:48:24.980 --> 02:48:27.320]  to make screens to sell. I'm not sure if they're screens anymore.
[02:48:27.320 --> 02:48:28.800]  I don't know how that shit happens. I'm not a printer,
[02:48:29.040 --> 02:48:29.960]  but they got to get you set up.
[02:48:30.520 --> 02:48:34.840]  They do a really decent job with an M at an amazing level of quality.
[02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:39.280]  They do a damn good job. Way better than decent. Mad decent. Yo,
[02:48:39.640 --> 02:48:43.280]  but they do a really good job. I love what they do. They've sent me stickers.
[02:48:43.280 --> 02:48:46.280]  They've sent me shirts. They've sent me, and it's not just my stuff.
[02:48:46.300 --> 02:48:49.400]  I've got shirts that they've printed for other brands that they didn't know were
[02:48:49.400 --> 02:48:52.720]  coming to me that I got from those people and all their stuff looks quality
[02:48:52.720 --> 02:48:55.560]  also. So much love, much respect to handmade apparel.
[02:48:55.560 --> 02:48:57.720]  Let them know that you're listening to the door from your heart podcast.
[02:48:58.120 --> 02:49:01.360]  I love supporting my friends in the industry that are doing stuff for us.
[02:49:01.560 --> 02:49:03.160]  If you're interested in one of these hoodies,
[02:49:03.280 --> 02:49:05.800]  send me an email to grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[02:49:06.400 --> 02:49:10.000]  They are very limited on quantity. I got 25 of them printed.
[02:49:10.840 --> 02:49:13.280]  I've got a lot of friends that have been on the show that have already picked
[02:49:13.300 --> 02:49:16.320]  them up. Mike's going to leave here today, looking stylish as fuck.
[02:49:16.320 --> 02:49:18.000]  And his new grow from your heart podcast hoodie.
[02:49:18.360 --> 02:49:21.640]  It's got the grow from your heart podcast logo above the left breast.
[02:49:21.680 --> 02:49:23.080]  It just says grow from your heart.
[02:49:23.480 --> 02:49:26.080]  And it's got the little EQ bars and red, yellow, and green.
[02:49:26.480 --> 02:49:29.040]  It does not have my face. However, on the back,
[02:49:29.080 --> 02:49:33.000]  it's got the logo very large and it's got the original logo with my face.
[02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:36.760]  And the EQ bars on it. It looks sweet. A shout out to handmade apparel.
[02:49:36.760 --> 02:49:38.680]  So I think it was Adam hand that did it himself.
[02:49:38.680 --> 02:49:42.600]  I think Adam hand adjusted the art because the art I sent him was a little
[02:49:42.600 --> 02:49:46.680]  pixel. Uh, I was made by it up a little. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:49:46.680 --> 02:49:50.080]  It was made by somebody else. That's not a super amazing graphic artist,
[02:49:50.100 --> 02:49:52.600]  but it was the right idea for what I wanted. Handmade apparel took it,
[02:49:52.640 --> 02:49:54.840]  polished it up. It looks super dope. It looks super slick.
[02:49:54.840 --> 02:49:56.720]  So they can handle your artwork, everything.
[02:49:57.200 --> 02:50:01.720]  And he thinks very open-mindedly. So if he describes something to Adam,
[02:50:02.040 --> 02:50:04.880]  he can draw it without ruining your idea.
[02:50:04.900 --> 02:50:08.960]  He can put your idea into motion if you're not an artist, which is really cool.
[02:50:08.960 --> 02:50:12.600]  Cause a lot of artists want to put their idea into your idea and then put it on
[02:50:12.600 --> 02:50:17.040]  paper. And then there goes your idea. And yeah. So yeah. Anyway,
[02:50:17.520 --> 02:50:19.960]  much love, mad respect to our friends at handmade apparel.
[02:50:19.960 --> 02:50:21.920]  Let's tell everybody what this show is going to be about.
[02:50:21.920 --> 02:50:24.880]  Cause I feel like we've been going on for a really long time and we haven't
[02:50:24.880 --> 02:50:29.280]  really dabbed out and rambling. That's what life is to be about.
[02:50:29.720 --> 02:50:31.720]  There's a today's shows.
[02:50:31.880 --> 02:50:35.360]  There's some rule changes that came down the pipe for Colorado concentrate
[02:50:35.360 --> 02:50:35.960]  companies.
[02:50:35.960 --> 02:50:40.000]  Yes. I found this article on Leafly because it was the only place I could find
[02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:43.120]  with this article after I did some searching and it says.
[02:50:43.160 --> 02:50:46.760]  Rule changes aren't, they're not sexy.
[02:50:47.240 --> 02:50:51.680]  And so they didn't make the press. There's no other way to describe it. It's,
[02:50:51.680 --> 02:50:55.400]  it's not, it's not something controversial.
[02:50:55.400 --> 02:50:59.400]  It's not something that there was big heated debate over.
[02:51:00.960 --> 02:51:04.120]  Um, we're like anti-pop people and pro-pop people were fighting in the
[02:51:04.120 --> 02:51:08.080]  courthouse or anything. So it didn't make the press a lot. It was quiet.
[02:51:08.360 --> 02:51:10.440]  All right, let's read the article. Uh, this is from Leafly.
[02:51:10.440 --> 02:51:13.880]  I'm looking for the author, Ben Alden, and this was written on December 12th,
[02:51:13.880 --> 02:51:17.400]  2016. Of course, this episode is coming out on December 26th.
[02:51:17.760 --> 02:51:20.320]  I hope everybody had a wonderful winter holiday,
[02:51:20.320 --> 02:51:21.920]  whichever one that it is you celebrate.
[02:51:21.920 --> 02:51:25.560]  We're not going to be inclusive, exclusive, racist, or biased or whatever.
[02:51:26.240 --> 02:51:27.080]  We love you all.
[02:51:27.080 --> 02:51:31.120]  Whatever gender you have chosen to identify as whatever holiday you are
[02:51:31.120 --> 02:51:32.560]  accepting. I'm in.
[02:51:33.080 --> 02:51:34.280]  Happy holidays, everybody.
[02:51:34.320 --> 02:51:37.000]  That's the truth. All right. Article goes like this on January 1st,
[02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:41.840]  2017 Colorado will raise its state regulated limit on the residual levels of
[02:51:41.840 --> 02:51:44.280]  volatile solvents allowed in cannabis concentrates.
[02:51:45.240 --> 02:51:48.640]  It's a little noticed rule change that involves dramatically increased levels of
[02:51:48.640 --> 02:51:51.080]  allowable solvents among the changes.
[02:51:51.120 --> 02:51:52.960]  And I'm going to read off some of the changes they list here.
[02:51:53.240 --> 02:51:54.680]  The legal threshold for butane,
[02:51:54.680 --> 02:51:59.240]  the solvent that puts the B and BHO will increase more than six fold from 800
[02:51:59.240 --> 02:52:03.120]  parts per million to 5,000 parts per million.
[02:52:03.600 --> 02:52:07.040]  I think I should slow down and kind of explain what that means. Um,
[02:52:07.600 --> 02:52:12.080]  so PPM means parts per million. That means that parts per million, right?
[02:52:12.080 --> 02:52:14.160]  That there are. So if there are a million parts in there,
[02:52:14.160 --> 02:52:18.280]  you are allowed to have 800 parts of butane in there before out of a million,
[02:52:18.280 --> 02:52:20.040]  which isn't a lot. You probably wouldn't notice that, right?
[02:52:20.040 --> 02:52:21.680]  If I gave you a million something and told you,
[02:52:21.680 --> 02:52:23.320]  pick me out 800 of them and give them to me,
[02:52:23.320 --> 02:52:24.600]  you wouldn't notice you're missing anything.
[02:52:25.480 --> 02:52:27.000]  Now you're allowed to have 5,000,
[02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:31.200]  which may start making a little bit of a difference. You may show that up.
[02:52:31.240 --> 02:52:36.240]  5,000 PPMs of residual solvents of butane feels like a whole lot of butane to
[02:52:37.600 --> 02:52:38.440]  me.
[02:52:39.040 --> 02:52:44.040]  It's a larger number, but without significantly more context,
[02:52:45.400 --> 02:52:47.240]  um, it's not helpful information.
[02:52:47.400 --> 02:52:52.000]  And I know for a fact that given the boiling points, um,
[02:52:52.040 --> 02:52:55.520]  I mean even like really, really, really,
[02:52:55.520 --> 02:52:58.520]  really high amounts of butane left in final product,
[02:52:58.920 --> 02:53:02.600]  all of that cooks off long before dab to face.
[02:53:02.640 --> 02:53:06.080]  Right. It comes off at the nail. If you're getting that much.
[02:53:06.080 --> 02:53:07.680]  Yep. If, if there's anything,
[02:53:07.720 --> 02:53:10.040]  if there's much of anything left over in the product,
[02:53:10.040 --> 02:53:14.400]  it's gone on the nail long before the dab gets to you. Okay. Um, with,
[02:53:14.520 --> 02:53:19.000]  with butane. Um, but if it, if it was harmful,
[02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:20.520]  they wouldn't be making these changes.
[02:53:20.920 --> 02:53:21.480]  Well, we don't,
[02:53:21.480 --> 02:53:25.600]  I don't think we have enough information yet to know how harmful smoking a
[02:53:25.800 --> 02:53:29.200]  concentrate made from butane could be. And that's from,
[02:53:29.520 --> 02:53:31.520]  and I'm at a heavy BHO advocate.
[02:53:31.520 --> 02:53:34.600]  I probably smoke more BHO than 90% of the world.
[02:53:34.800 --> 02:53:38.720]  Most of the health rules that they haven't been able to research specifically
[02:53:38.720 --> 02:53:42.720]  for cannabis. They have already researched specifically for similar items.
[02:53:42.720 --> 02:53:47.280]  True. Um, we know a lot about pesticide residual limits because, um,
[02:53:47.280 --> 02:53:50.400]  of the tobacco industry, there's already something that's mass produced.
[02:53:50.400 --> 02:53:52.920]  That's smoked. Um,
[02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:56.440]  we know PPM limits from some other things for like inhaled medicines.
[02:53:56.920 --> 02:53:59.480]  All right. Let me keep going to the article. Cause it mentioned stuff like that.
[02:53:59.480 --> 02:54:03.160]  I've pre-read, I did some research. Uh, this also another rule,
[02:54:03.200 --> 02:54:04.880]  allowed residuals for heptanes.
[02:54:04.880 --> 02:54:09.800]  Another class of solvents will go up by a factor of 10 xylene's industrial
[02:54:09.800 --> 02:54:13.080]  solvents that technically aren't allowed to be used for cannabis extraction at
[02:54:13.080 --> 02:54:16.280]  all will be permitted at concentrations of up to 2,170
[02:54:18.600 --> 02:54:19.800]  particles per million,
[02:54:20.040 --> 02:54:24.360]  significantly higher than the premium previous limit of one PPM.
[02:54:25.080 --> 02:54:27.080]  The state residual limit on benzene,
[02:54:27.120 --> 02:54:31.200]  perhaps the most hazardous chemical of the group will double from less than one
[02:54:31.200 --> 02:54:35.680]  PPM to less than two PPMs.
[02:54:35.680 --> 02:54:38.400]  There's a little article here that gives you a graph that is way too small to
[02:54:38.440 --> 02:54:39.560]  read. Well, I mean,
[02:54:39.560 --> 02:54:43.000]  and that's a good example of how statistics can sound scary.
[02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:47.360]  Like it's going to more than double from less than one to almost two to almost
[02:54:47.360 --> 02:54:51.320]  two. Like, but depending on how dangerous those chemicals are,
[02:54:51.320 --> 02:54:52.280]  that can make a difference.
[02:54:52.280 --> 02:54:54.520]  And there's something I want to talk about once we get rid of the work done
[02:54:54.520 --> 02:54:57.160]  through the article, it goes on to say on the surface,
[02:54:57.320 --> 02:55:00.360]  these are staggering increases in chemicals that at some levels have been
[02:55:00.360 --> 02:55:02.480]  associated with nausea, irregular heartbeat,
[02:55:02.480 --> 02:55:06.480]  increased risk of cancer and even death regulators, uh,
[02:55:06.480 --> 02:55:09.720]  testing laboratory operators and industry members in other States have
[02:55:09.720 --> 02:55:11.320]  expressed surprises at the changes,
[02:55:11.760 --> 02:55:16.160]  which will apply to both adult use and medical markets. Mike Van Dyke,
[02:55:16.160 --> 02:55:18.560]  chief of the environmental epidemiology,
[02:55:18.560 --> 02:55:22.120]  occupational health and toxicology branch at the Colorado department of public
[02:55:22.120 --> 02:55:25.880]  health and environment will recommend the new limit acknowledge that, uh,
[02:55:25.920 --> 02:55:29.280]  which recommended the new limit acknowledge that concentrates capable of
[02:55:29.280 --> 02:55:32.600]  clearing the regulatory hurdles could be noticeably different from what's
[02:55:32.600 --> 02:55:33.720]  currently allowed.
[02:55:34.200 --> 02:55:37.240]  Consumers are going to feel like they may taste it.
[02:55:37.280 --> 02:55:41.080]  He said of these new allowed butane levels, they might smell it.
[02:55:41.560 --> 02:55:44.280]  I'm surprised nobody else has even actually been interested in this.
[02:55:44.280 --> 02:55:46.040]  He told me in an interview just last week,
[02:55:46.720 --> 02:55:51.400]  the guys making these rules are saying that we are going to taste and
[02:55:51.400 --> 02:55:54.120]  smell butane in our concentrates with these.
[02:55:54.120 --> 02:55:55.560]  Not possible at those levels.
[02:55:56.520 --> 02:55:59.200]  I don't know enough about how much butane that is to know.
[02:56:00.200 --> 02:56:04.400]  It just per, just when you break it down per per million, when you, I mean,
[02:56:04.400 --> 02:56:08.440]  if that whole gram of hash is 1 million pieces,
[02:56:09.040 --> 02:56:13.400]  the 5,000 that you're talking about aren't visible,
[02:56:14.520 --> 02:56:15.800]  like they're not visually,
[02:56:15.840 --> 02:56:18.680]  visually identifiable as separatable from the whole,
[02:56:19.040 --> 02:56:22.760]  like we're talking about an incredibly small amount here. Um,
[02:56:22.880 --> 02:56:26.040]  it does surprise me that this didn't make the press because it, it,
[02:56:26.040 --> 02:56:30.160]  it does increase, um, residual solvents.
[02:56:30.160 --> 02:56:32.080]  That's exactly, there's no other way to sound,
[02:56:32.280 --> 02:56:36.600]  to say that to make it sound better or worse. I don't think. Um,
[02:56:37.680 --> 02:56:40.120]  it seems like something that would make the press, but, uh,
[02:56:40.160 --> 02:56:42.080]  it was reported almost nowhere.
[02:56:42.080 --> 02:56:46.520]  The only reason I know about this rule change is because of the labeling rules
[02:56:46.520 --> 02:56:49.360]  that came along with it. Um,
[02:56:49.440 --> 02:56:53.280]  a friend of mine was negatively affected by those rules.
[02:56:53.600 --> 02:56:54.960]  So I heard about them that way.
[02:56:55.080 --> 02:56:57.840]  Oh yeah. I heard about an incident. Let me continue with the article.
[02:56:58.160 --> 02:56:59.840]  I goes on to say there are a few things,
[02:56:59.840 --> 02:57:01.960]  Colorado department of public health and environments.
[02:57:01.960 --> 02:57:05.000]  Van Dyck wants to make clear about the new rules. Here is one.
[02:57:05.360 --> 02:57:08.120]  This change was not a result of any industry pressure.
[02:57:08.480 --> 02:57:12.240]  The increase didn't come at the behest. What's that word mean? The behest.
[02:57:12.240 --> 02:57:15.240]  I know what the word means. I've never read that word. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:57:15.240 --> 02:57:17.520]  I pushed for it. I just didn't know if I said it right. I feel like it did.
[02:57:18.800 --> 02:57:21.280]  The increase did not come with the behest of lobbyists. He told leafly.
[02:57:21.280 --> 02:57:24.520]  In fact, in the work groups, if we heard anything from the industry,
[02:57:24.920 --> 02:57:28.040]  I think we heard the other side that these were too high. He said,
[02:57:28.040 --> 02:57:31.600]  which is an uncommon place to be. So what's going on?
[02:57:31.680 --> 02:57:34.000]  The justification for the change, according to Van Dyck,
[02:57:34.040 --> 02:57:38.040]  is that the new limits truly follow the best currently available medical and
[02:57:38.040 --> 02:57:39.200]  scientific guidance.
[02:57:39.600 --> 02:57:43.360]  This was reevaluated based on trying to make things health based. He explained,
[02:57:43.720 --> 02:57:48.000]  these numbers come from the international harmonized guidelines for residual
[02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:49.720]  solvents and pharmaceuticals.
[02:57:50.240 --> 02:57:54.360]  Van Dyck is referring to a published scientific article he cited in a July
[02:57:54.360 --> 02:57:56.080]  letter to Jim Barak,
[02:57:56.200 --> 02:57:59.280]  director of the Colorado department of revenues enforcement division,
[02:57:59.360 --> 02:58:01.760]  which is in charge of enforcing the new standards.
[02:58:02.240 --> 02:58:05.840]  Van Dyck provided the letter and spoke at length to leafly about the coming
[02:58:05.840 --> 02:58:09.520]  change. Will these numbers stand the test of time? I don't know. He said,
[02:58:09.840 --> 02:58:11.600]  we're open to new data that comes out,
[02:58:11.600 --> 02:58:14.680]  but our goal is to make sure that we maintain the best we can,
[02:58:14.840 --> 02:58:19.520]  the best evidence based regulations for health.
[02:58:19.960 --> 02:58:23.120]  The agency is trying to do precisely what has been asked. Van Dyck said,
[02:58:23.400 --> 02:58:25.760]  legislation passed this year. Uh,
[02:58:25.840 --> 02:58:30.600]  then is list the house bill 16 dash 1261 put the Colorado department of public
[02:58:30.600 --> 02:58:34.200]  health and environment in charge of recommending testing standards based on
[02:58:34.200 --> 02:58:37.200]  medical reports and published scientific literature.
[02:58:37.680 --> 02:58:40.800]  When the Colorado department of revenues set the previous limits in the wake of
[02:58:40.800 --> 02:58:45.640]  amendment 64 is passage. It was a fast and furious process. Van Dyck said,
[02:58:45.880 --> 02:58:48.760]  there were times you came up with numbers because that's what you came up with
[02:58:48.760 --> 02:58:51.240]  at the time. Despite the eye popping increases,
[02:58:51.240 --> 02:58:56.000]  he said new limits adhere more strictly to the latest available evidence in
[02:58:56.000 --> 02:59:00.560]  scientific research. Um, there's a lot more to this.
[02:59:00.560 --> 02:59:01.960]  I'm going to skim it real quick. Go ahead, Mike.
[02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:07.000]  That that model of we picked a number and we kind of pulled it out of our ass,
[02:59:09.360 --> 02:59:14.360]  but we, we just went with the much more restrictive sounding rule, um,
[02:59:14.440 --> 02:59:18.200]  to start off with. And now we're dialing it back, um,
[02:59:18.280 --> 02:59:20.160]  to more in line with reality.
[02:59:20.200 --> 02:59:23.800]  I think we're going to see that in a lot of different areas of regulation in
[02:59:23.800 --> 02:59:25.320]  Colorado. Um,
[02:59:25.360 --> 02:59:29.760]  we're realizing that in a lot of ways we way overdid it in some areas. Right.
[02:59:29.880 --> 02:59:33.280]  I mean, it doesn't surprise me that this is one. Um,
[02:59:34.040 --> 02:59:37.640]  I wouldn't be surprised in the next two years to see, um,
[02:59:37.640 --> 02:59:42.080]  a lot of different testing, um, rules and regulations tweaked,
[02:59:42.520 --> 02:59:45.480]  um, up and down as, as we learn more.
[02:59:45.520 --> 02:59:49.840]  And we finally get around to checking the research, um, our driving limit,
[02:59:49.840 --> 02:59:51.640]  for example, the five nanograms,
[02:59:52.560 --> 02:59:56.720]  that's just a rule another state had in place and they just pulled it out of
[02:59:56.720 --> 03:00:00.760]  their ass. Um, there's no research at all to tie it with that,
[03:00:00.760 --> 03:00:02.560]  but we made that part of our law here.
[03:00:02.600 --> 03:00:05.520]  I wouldn't be allowed near a car. Five nanograms is a real thing.
[03:00:05.880 --> 03:00:08.760]  Uh, I tried to have my, uh,
[03:00:08.840 --> 03:00:13.360]  my primary care physician run the test on me after not smoking like all night.
[03:00:13.400 --> 03:00:16.920]  And then going in in the morning, um, and she didn't know which test to run.
[03:00:17.640 --> 03:00:20.960]  Um, and so I had to run three different THC tests and all of them,
[03:00:20.960 --> 03:00:25.720]  I was whatever the test result came back. I was way above five. Um,
[03:00:27.160 --> 03:00:30.400]  but that we're doing that research. Now that research just got funded in
[03:00:30.400 --> 03:00:32.680]  Colorado. So in two years, three years,
[03:00:33.040 --> 03:00:36.240]  we'll have more information to change that rule.
[03:00:36.240 --> 03:00:37.880]  And I think that's going to happen in a lot of places.
[03:00:37.880 --> 03:00:40.800]  It doesn't surprise me that it's happening here with a PPM limits.
[03:00:41.120 --> 03:00:43.920]  Well, the article keeps going. And the guy says, actually, frankly, no,
[03:00:43.920 --> 03:00:46.320]  he doesn't say actually, he actually says, frankly,
[03:00:46.640 --> 03:00:50.200]  we're not saying that extracted marijuana products should have 5,000 PPMs of
[03:00:50.200 --> 03:00:53.080]  butane in them, uh, in Colorado. He said,
[03:00:53.080 --> 03:00:57.320]  what we're saying is 5,000 is a health based limit, but he, then it goes on.
[03:00:57.320 --> 03:00:58.520]  Sorry. I'm reading way too fast,
[03:00:58.800 --> 03:01:02.080]  but didn't he just acknowledge the possibility of literally smelling butane in
[03:01:02.080 --> 03:01:04.960]  the BHO approved by the state for medical patients?
[03:01:05.520 --> 03:01:08.920]  I think there may be a lot of market drivers that push those numbers lower
[03:01:09.440 --> 03:01:12.440]  than Van Dyck acknowledged and smell could certainly be one of them,
[03:01:12.720 --> 03:01:16.200]  but he repeated it's not from a health perspective that those numbers should be
[03:01:16.200 --> 03:01:18.640]  lower, but there are residual solvents,
[03:01:18.960 --> 03:01:23.320]  but are residual solvents merely a matter of product taste and quality or is
[03:01:23.320 --> 03:01:27.280]  scientific research still too limited to inspire consumer confidence?
[03:01:27.680 --> 03:01:30.160]  It may be a little bit of both.
[03:01:30.520 --> 03:01:32.280]  And that's what I'm going to jump in right now,
[03:01:32.280 --> 03:01:37.400]  because even if we're allowed to put 5,000 particles per million to
[03:01:37.400 --> 03:01:40.240]  leave that in there and not purge it out properly,
[03:01:40.840 --> 03:01:44.240]  most consumers are educated enough to go. I don't want that shit.
[03:01:44.320 --> 03:01:45.160]  And they would go by.
[03:01:45.480 --> 03:01:48.360]  So I've got two different products of shatter on my table right now.
[03:01:48.720 --> 03:01:49.680]  One was a gift.
[03:01:51.560 --> 03:01:54.800]  One will probably remain on this piece of parchment paper until the end of
[03:01:54.800 --> 03:01:58.240]  fucking time. Cause I do not want to dab it. The other, however,
[03:01:58.240 --> 03:02:01.760]  was made by an artist who took their time and their energy.
[03:02:03.040 --> 03:02:03.160]  Now,
[03:02:03.160 --> 03:02:06.960]  if you went to the dispensary Mike and this dark stuff that looks like squirrel
[03:02:06.960 --> 03:02:11.160]  poop was here available for you for $25 a gram plus tax.
[03:02:11.320 --> 03:02:12.840]  It looks like a piece of Onyx.
[03:02:14.400 --> 03:02:18.440]  It is pretty damn dark or this golden shiny sparkly stuff here.
[03:02:18.480 --> 03:02:22.280]  It's like pancake syrup. Ooh, it does look like thin maple syrup.
[03:02:22.480 --> 03:02:23.560]  Nice. And it's kind of gold.
[03:02:23.560 --> 03:02:26.880]  It's got a little syrup that's spilled on the white plate is exactly what it
[03:02:26.880 --> 03:02:29.960]  looks like. All right. Which one would you grab all day long?
[03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:33.320]  All day long. The honey. And if this was at the store, would you even buy it?
[03:02:33.760 --> 03:02:35.560]  Nope. See? So you're an educated consumer.
[03:02:36.160 --> 03:02:39.600]  And I even know that a lot of times you get that dark color just because the
[03:02:39.720 --> 03:02:42.400]  material wasn't processed quickly enough.
[03:02:42.400 --> 03:02:46.120]  And it had time to age a little bit before it got processed.
[03:02:46.360 --> 03:02:49.280]  I believe that that hash. And if you're listening to my podcast,
[03:02:49.320 --> 03:02:51.120]  my friend that makes this hash, you may listen.
[03:02:51.400 --> 03:02:53.040]  I did not tell you this when you were here the other day,
[03:02:53.040 --> 03:02:55.080]  we were just doing our thing and I didn't want to mention this.
[03:02:55.400 --> 03:02:58.520]  I think what's happening is if you were using a closed loop system,
[03:02:59.040 --> 03:03:02.520]  the material is sitting in the butane far too long. Uh,
[03:03:02.520 --> 03:03:05.320]  he was talking about, this was his record pool,
[03:03:05.320 --> 03:03:09.680]  how they got more hash from the amount of material than they amount of material
[03:03:09.680 --> 03:03:10.840]  than they've ever pulled before.
[03:03:10.840 --> 03:03:12.960]  It's because you've pulled out a bunch of chlorophyll, my friend.
[03:03:13.320 --> 03:03:16.440]  That's why the hash has got this dark greenish color. Uh, yes,
[03:03:16.440 --> 03:03:17.720]  there's a lot of THC here,
[03:03:17.720 --> 03:03:21.280]  but you lowered your THC quantity by pulling more chlorophyll.
[03:03:21.280 --> 03:03:23.640]  You increased your weight, but you lowered your potency.
[03:03:23.960 --> 03:03:27.360]  So if you're doing it in a closed loop system, be a little quicker about it.
[03:03:27.360 --> 03:03:29.440]  Don't leave it soaking in the soak for so long.
[03:03:29.680 --> 03:03:32.360]  It's the hash version of putting a coin in your grinder.
[03:03:32.640 --> 03:03:35.800]  It may be time to clean the butane and the machine also. Uh,
[03:03:35.800 --> 03:03:38.560]  if you're doing this, if this hash was made open blasted,
[03:03:38.800 --> 03:03:40.640]  what you did was you ran too many cans.
[03:03:40.680 --> 03:03:44.840]  You needed to stop a can before because you're pushing it through the tube.
[03:03:44.840 --> 03:03:48.840]  You're pushing it's going, pay attention. It should run piss clear.
[03:03:49.160 --> 03:03:52.200]  It should look like well hydrated pee. It should be clear coming out of there.
[03:03:52.200 --> 03:03:55.360]  As soon as you see it come in dark, stop putting the taint through it.
[03:03:56.080 --> 03:04:01.080]  I will go as far as to move my can over the grass or over the cement and just
[03:04:01.120 --> 03:04:03.640]  drip it right into there and quit putting it into my catcher.
[03:04:03.680 --> 03:04:06.240]  I use a jar people do to batch too. When I open a,
[03:04:06.280 --> 03:04:08.400]  when I open blast into a open container,
[03:04:08.400 --> 03:04:13.320]  I do it into a Mason jar because it's got a smaller opening with a less,
[03:04:13.360 --> 03:04:15.400]  uh, I don't do this anymore. Mike, you're looking at me like, don't say that,
[03:04:15.400 --> 03:04:16.240]  but I would do it.
[03:04:16.960 --> 03:04:19.400]  This is a particularly bad idea for a couple of different reasons.
[03:04:19.400 --> 03:04:22.520]  Do it into the Mason joy prevents you from getting contaminants into it.
[03:04:22.520 --> 03:04:26.840]  If you do it into a big flat Pyrex dish leaves and shit from the trees fall in
[03:04:26.840 --> 03:04:29.720]  because you got to do it outside bugs fly into their fucking butterfly land.
[03:04:30.320 --> 03:04:33.400]  The pancake tray or the cookie tray don't make shrapnel though.
[03:04:33.560 --> 03:04:36.040]  Yeah. We're not going to blow anything up the way we, yeah.
[03:04:36.400 --> 03:04:39.400]  Everybody says that. Right. Just don't open blast people.
[03:04:39.440 --> 03:04:42.040]  I don't make hash anymore. That's why I feel free talking about it.
[03:04:42.440 --> 03:04:46.480]  It's you. It's working with, with butane like that.
[03:04:46.480 --> 03:04:50.920]  There's safety precautions that it's just one way our community keeps fucking
[03:04:50.920 --> 03:04:51.760]  ourselves.
[03:04:52.200 --> 03:04:56.520]  Every time some idiot blows up their apartment or their house trying to make dabs
[03:04:56.520 --> 03:05:01.080]  in the backyard, like just leave it to the fucking professionals.
[03:05:01.160 --> 03:05:02.520]  True. I agree with that.
[03:05:02.640 --> 03:05:06.280]  I remember reading in history class about bathtub gin and people blowing
[03:05:06.280 --> 03:05:08.160]  themselves up, trying to make gin in the bathtub.
[03:05:08.160 --> 03:05:10.720]  And I thought how dumb were people back then?
[03:05:10.720 --> 03:05:15.920]  And then here I am 35 and my contemporaries are doing the exact same freaking
[03:05:15.920 --> 03:05:18.560]  hash professionals six years ago.
[03:05:19.120 --> 03:05:22.040]  Back then the professionals were us. You know what I mean?
[03:05:22.040 --> 03:05:26.800]  Like big D was a professional back then and he was doing it with a fucking
[03:05:27.120 --> 03:05:30.800]  until three years ago he was doing it in a tube in a parking lot at a
[03:05:30.800 --> 03:05:34.360]  professional business with a license. That's how it, they were okay with that.
[03:05:34.840 --> 03:05:35.560]  Like, yeah, now,
[03:05:35.560 --> 03:05:39.040]  now you got to have a fucking blast proof building and all kinds of fire
[03:05:39.040 --> 03:05:42.920]  equipment and suits and all training and hazmat material.
[03:05:43.160 --> 03:05:46.520]  It's a way different world now. So let those professionals do it.
[03:05:46.800 --> 03:05:51.120]  And I think that if we legalize cannabis everywhere, well, no,
[03:05:51.600 --> 03:05:56.040]  it's definitely a legalization in the market. Yeah. Because then if a lot of the
[03:05:56.040 --> 03:05:58.840]  places where the, the frequent, um,
[03:05:59.200 --> 03:06:03.760]  BHO home cook blowups are happening are in
[03:06:03.760 --> 03:06:07.880]  legalization states where it's 65, 75 a gram on the shelf for,
[03:06:08.480 --> 03:06:12.000]  um, 75% illegal shatters where there is no option.
[03:06:12.000 --> 03:06:14.280]  Then in places where there's, there's no legal access.
[03:06:14.400 --> 03:06:16.680]  You gotta make, if you have to grow your own and make your own,
[03:06:16.680 --> 03:06:19.040]  you fucking will because people want to get high.
[03:06:19.240 --> 03:06:21.960]  They're going to do what they have to get high to get medicated.
[03:06:21.960 --> 03:06:23.720]  They're going to do that. And if it's not available,
[03:06:24.000 --> 03:06:25.040]  they're going to figure out a way.
[03:06:25.400 --> 03:06:28.440]  And since they just grew some shitty weed because they can't get the products to
[03:06:28.440 --> 03:06:30.440]  go to proper weed, now they got to do something with it.
[03:06:30.440 --> 03:06:31.720]  So let's just go get some butane,
[03:06:31.720 --> 03:06:35.000]  run it through some cans and blow up the house and make this look even worse.
[03:06:35.000 --> 03:06:36.520]  So the more legalized it is,
[03:06:36.520 --> 03:06:40.600]  the more likely you are to screw up the safety precautions you need to take.
[03:06:40.840 --> 03:06:41.920]  If it's just legal,
[03:06:41.920 --> 03:06:44.600]  then you can just go to the store and get it on the shelf in Colorado.
[03:06:44.600 --> 03:06:46.360]  You can go, I can think of four places.
[03:06:46.360 --> 03:06:51.400]  I can go right now. I've never made it for 20, 25, 35 a gram.
[03:06:52.080 --> 03:06:56.400]  Good fire shatter. Yep. Yep. There's no reason to risk blowing your house up.
[03:06:56.480 --> 03:06:57.680]  I'm going to keep reading this article.
[03:06:57.760 --> 03:06:59.680]  I feel like we've gotten through the gist of the article,
[03:06:59.680 --> 03:07:02.200]  but I'm going to keep reading it anyway, just cause it feels like there's more.
[03:07:02.200 --> 03:07:04.040]  It says a knowledge problem.
[03:07:04.040 --> 03:07:07.320]  A lot of eyes widened when I talked to people who weren't aware of Colorado's
[03:07:07.320 --> 03:07:08.160]  new standards.
[03:07:08.200 --> 03:07:11.680]  Some consumers believe that industrial solvents are inherently hazardous to their
[03:07:11.680 --> 03:07:14.400]  health and should be avoided at virtually any level.
[03:07:14.760 --> 03:07:18.520]  Many concentrate consumers now opt for solventless extracts such as Rosin or
[03:07:18.520 --> 03:07:22.160]  bubble hash. Others don't worry as much pointing out, uh,
[03:07:22.200 --> 03:07:23.120]  then it says accurately,
[03:07:23.120 --> 03:07:26.560]  according to most scientists I talked to that someone who smells a whiff of
[03:07:26.560 --> 03:07:31.280]  butane from a Bic lighter has already inhaled way more than they'll get in a
[03:07:31.280 --> 03:07:35.560]  day of dabbing. That's a great, a great comparison. I like that.
[03:07:35.600 --> 03:07:37.800]  Well, he's sitting there talking about tasting it.
[03:07:37.800 --> 03:07:41.960]  What in the hash at 5,000 PPM and I'm sitting there thinking about refilling my
[03:07:42.000 --> 03:07:45.760]  torch and when your torch gets full and you get that little blowback,
[03:07:46.160 --> 03:07:51.160]  I guarantee you you're at way more than 5,000 PPM of butane in the air around
[03:07:51.520 --> 03:07:55.760]  your head in that moment as it's, it's blasted out excess. I mean,
[03:07:55.880 --> 03:07:57.360]  I'm sure it dissipates quickly,
[03:07:57.360 --> 03:08:02.360]  but I don't taste butane then and I haven't just forced that through a several
[03:08:04.120 --> 03:08:06.920]  hundred degree now. Right. I agree with that. Like there's,
[03:08:08.800 --> 03:08:11.920]  well this guy, this guy goes on to say it's not the butane said Nick Mosley
[03:08:11.920 --> 03:08:16.360]  co-owner and chief science officer at confidence, confidence analytics,
[03:08:16.720 --> 03:08:18.960]  a cannabis testing laboratory in Washington state.
[03:08:19.320 --> 03:08:22.040]  The butane is really not a huge health risk. He said,
[03:08:22.080 --> 03:08:24.080]  adding that it takes quite a bit,
[03:08:24.320 --> 03:08:28.240]  way more than you'd get from dabbing or a vape pen to cause serious harm such as
[03:08:28.240 --> 03:08:31.160]  liver damage. And then there's a 1990,
[03:08:31.240 --> 03:08:35.840]  a 1981 case study cited by the U S department of health and human services found
[03:08:35.840 --> 03:08:40.480]  that exposure to 10,000 PPMs for 10 minutes may lead to drowsiness,
[03:08:40.520 --> 03:08:43.520]  but doesn't appear to cause systemic effects in humans.
[03:08:43.840 --> 03:08:48.840]  The average dab consists of about 10 milligrams to 20 milligrams of concentrate
[03:08:50.440 --> 03:08:55.040]  mostly at confidence analytics said, and in the eyes of Colorado regulators,
[03:08:55.040 --> 03:08:56.520]  he added there,
[03:08:56.560 --> 03:09:01.560]  these class three solvents are not cause for concern at 5,000 PPMs when the dose
[03:09:01.600 --> 03:09:05.480]  of the substance is so low. Then they go on to say,
[03:09:05.480 --> 03:09:09.800]  mostly did call the levels of xylene and benzene in Colorado concerning the
[03:09:09.800 --> 03:09:11.200]  issue with xylenes and benzene.
[03:09:11.200 --> 03:09:15.520]  He explained is that the contaminants are unintentionally there.
[03:09:15.880 --> 03:09:18.880]  In other words, those chemicals aren't part of the extraction process.
[03:09:18.880 --> 03:09:23.080]  Those chemicals are sometimes used to clean equipment and may inadvertently
[03:09:23.080 --> 03:09:27.160]  become part of the final product. See that shit that sucks. I don't like that.
[03:09:27.720 --> 03:09:30.920]  They're also sometimes found in low quality solvents. Okay.
[03:09:30.920 --> 03:09:33.640]  So if you don't distill your butane properly, in other words,
[03:09:33.640 --> 03:09:38.160]  their contaminants in the contaminant, mostly wasn't there are contaminants in
[03:09:38.160 --> 03:09:39.000]  the contaminant.
[03:09:39.160 --> 03:09:42.600]  Mostly wasn't trying to consider to criticize Colorado's new limits from a
[03:09:42.600 --> 03:09:43.400]  health perspective,
[03:09:43.400 --> 03:09:47.080]  though he didn't sound especially jazzed about the idea of finding those
[03:09:47.080 --> 03:09:50.800]  residual levels in a concentrate either. It just meant that a higher,
[03:09:51.080 --> 03:09:54.880]  but soon to be illegal level of residuals could indicate careless extraction
[03:09:54.880 --> 03:09:57.040]  methods or low quality products.
[03:09:57.480 --> 03:10:01.080]  And see that's what a lot of people's concern is going to be that this is going
[03:10:01.080 --> 03:10:04.600]  to make extractors lazy. Oh, I don't have to take all this out.
[03:10:04.640 --> 03:10:06.840]  Let's hurry up and get this out of the back of it.
[03:10:06.840 --> 03:10:08.720]  So we can get the next batch in the back of it.
[03:10:08.880 --> 03:10:10.280]  Cause this is going to pass lab tests.
[03:10:10.280 --> 03:10:11.840]  This is going to be able to go on the shelves.
[03:10:13.560 --> 03:10:16.240]  The limits were drastically increased,
[03:10:16.240 --> 03:10:19.680]  but they were still drastically increased to a number so small
[03:10:21.320 --> 03:10:25.640]  that it's unnoticeable. It's, it's a super tiny amount.
[03:10:25.640 --> 03:10:28.720]  And when you think about all the other testing and stuff that goes into it,
[03:10:30.160 --> 03:10:34.400]  this is a conversation we're only able to have because it's insanely legal here.
[03:10:35.000 --> 03:10:35.840]  Um,
[03:10:35.880 --> 03:10:40.640]  statewide we have access to product
[03:10:41.240 --> 03:10:45.680]  unmatched anywhere in the U S as far as testing and labeling goes.
[03:10:46.840 --> 03:10:50.000]  Um, we know more about the product we're consuming than anyone on the planet.
[03:10:50.680 --> 03:10:55.520]  And going through these rulemaking hearings as part of that,
[03:10:55.880 --> 03:10:59.520]  like these are the limits for anything else on the market. Um,
[03:10:59.560 --> 03:11:04.040]  I'm not encouraging extractors to, to push the envelope,
[03:11:04.040 --> 03:11:08.280]  the upper limits that are allowed now. Um, but if,
[03:11:08.320 --> 03:11:12.480]  if these are allowed for any other product I buy at a store or a
[03:11:12.480 --> 03:11:16.360]  pharmacy, um, I don't see why they shouldn't be allowed for my, my hash either.
[03:11:17.720 --> 03:11:21.760]  Um, but I also understand the movement away from solvent, uh,
[03:11:22.280 --> 03:11:23.400]  solvent made hash.
[03:11:23.880 --> 03:11:28.680]  I get the people that are looking for high grade water extract. Um,
[03:11:28.800 --> 03:11:32.280]  a lot of people are on that Rosin train. Yeah. A lot of people love Rosin.
[03:11:32.320 --> 03:11:35.560]  A lot of people are haters of BHO. Um,
[03:11:36.320 --> 03:11:37.920]  I get it. The, uh,
[03:11:38.000 --> 03:11:42.360]  a big part of the marijuana community came here fleeing,
[03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:46.360]  um, the pharmaceutical industry for one reason or another.
[03:11:46.880 --> 03:11:50.000]  And the idea of, uh,
[03:11:50.040 --> 03:11:54.800]  their marijuana industry moving towards that model
[03:11:54.800 --> 03:11:57.880]  in any way is scary. Um,
[03:11:58.880 --> 03:12:03.800]  moving away from natural in any way is scary to them. Um,
[03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:08.400]  I, I hate to be the one to point out that their flowers and the,
[03:12:08.640 --> 03:12:12.720]  the BHO hash are almost identical, um,
[03:12:12.720 --> 03:12:17.720]  in every way, except for a little bit of solvent using the extract.
[03:12:18.240 --> 03:12:23.080]  Um, everything that's in that flower is going to be in that extract, um,
[03:12:23.120 --> 03:12:26.480]  including all the batch that's already in your flower, because just because it's
[03:12:26.520 --> 03:12:30.320]  a plant doesn't mean it's good for you or natural in the end.
[03:12:30.440 --> 03:12:31.240]  For a little bit,
[03:12:31.240 --> 03:12:35.400]  a lot of people were under the impression that the clear and distillate was
[03:12:35.400 --> 03:12:39.840]  removing solvents. But we have recently discovered that that is not true.
[03:12:40.760 --> 03:12:45.720]  You have to use a separate filter to get out pesticides and solvents from the
[03:12:45.720 --> 03:12:48.160]  clay. It's getting rid of the solvents because we're heating it high enough.
[03:12:48.320 --> 03:12:50.200]  It's the pesticides that we're not getting out.
[03:12:50.200 --> 03:12:52.240]  I said that wrong probably because I took too many dabs.
[03:12:52.280 --> 03:12:57.280]  There were a lot of rumors about the clear and 99% of them were,
[03:12:57.520 --> 03:12:58.840]  were just bullshit.
[03:12:59.240 --> 03:13:01.960]  But I do love some well-made distillate. Oh my gosh.
[03:13:02.080 --> 03:13:04.920]  I've had some amazing distillate. Um,
[03:13:05.680 --> 03:13:07.920]  but I don't at all understand the hype for the clear.
[03:13:07.920 --> 03:13:12.560]  And I know people that are obsessed with the clear that rant and rave about it.
[03:13:13.200 --> 03:13:14.040]  Um,
[03:13:14.200 --> 03:13:17.400]  because of the hype and not because of its actual properties,
[03:13:17.640 --> 03:13:22.640]  I would prefer my distillate to come without turps and let me put my own turps
[03:13:22.920 --> 03:13:24.840]  in there. That's what I would prefer.
[03:13:25.080 --> 03:13:29.000]  I see. One of the things I really like in, in my hash was like,
[03:13:29.000 --> 03:13:33.320]  the reason I'm such a live resin fanatic is that flavor.
[03:13:33.320 --> 03:13:37.560]  Like it's all already there. I just scoop in, in glob. Yeah.
[03:13:37.880 --> 03:13:38.960]  I'm glob.
[03:13:39.080 --> 03:13:43.520]  Teeny glob. Yeah. I was, I wasn't gonna, I was gonna let you have it. Um,
[03:13:43.600 --> 03:13:44.440]  but I,
[03:13:45.320 --> 03:13:49.440]  I, the actual, like taking the, uh, distillate dunking it,
[03:13:49.800 --> 03:13:54.080]  that's fun for me, but that's, I don't want to build it.
[03:13:54.080 --> 03:13:55.560]  I just want to enjoy it. Yeah.
[03:13:55.640 --> 03:13:59.040]  And one of the things I love about cannabis is the,
[03:13:59.040 --> 03:14:04.040]  the huge flavor profile variety. And, um,
[03:14:04.840 --> 03:14:05.200]  I mean,
[03:14:05.200 --> 03:14:09.120]  it's more fun to me to taste what that flower was supposed to taste like then
[03:14:09.120 --> 03:14:10.920]  going to the soda factory and having,
[03:14:11.120 --> 03:14:16.080]  having them do like 25 different syrups to create that soda flavor. Yeah.
[03:14:16.120 --> 03:14:19.600]  I get you. Okay. I just like when you can take some distillate, I don't,
[03:14:20.120 --> 03:14:23.160]  I feel like they kind of overdo it when they go mixing the turps in on their own.
[03:14:23.160 --> 03:14:25.320]  When they sell me the distillate, it's overdone.
[03:14:25.360 --> 03:14:30.240]  Every distillate I've had that has terpenes reintroduced has way overdone it.
[03:14:30.240 --> 03:14:32.560]  Yeah. And I'd rather just be able to do it myself.
[03:14:32.560 --> 03:14:36.640]  And then I can buy a bottle of distillate and three or four vials of turps and
[03:14:36.640 --> 03:14:38.400]  mix and match and make it the way I want.
[03:14:38.760 --> 03:14:40.240]  And then when I run out of that distillate,
[03:14:40.240 --> 03:14:42.080]  I just put the turps right on my shatter.
[03:14:42.920 --> 03:14:45.920]  I've been getting little tiny pipettes and just dipping it right onto the
[03:14:45.920 --> 03:14:46.760]  shatter.
[03:14:46.880 --> 03:14:51.640]  I do believe that the turpenoids contribute heavily to my high because I can dab
[03:14:51.640 --> 03:14:56.280]  the same shatter and put different turps on it and you'd get different effects.
[03:14:56.280 --> 03:14:59.720]  You tease the future show about, um,
[03:14:59.760 --> 03:15:03.640]  lab testing and how it's changed some things. Um,
[03:15:04.600 --> 03:15:09.520]  and it's definitely helped us lose focus on the variety
[03:15:09.520 --> 03:15:13.680]  of, of, uh, compounds in the plant that influence the, the,
[03:15:13.720 --> 03:15:17.400]  the high, the experience, the medical effect. Um,
[03:15:18.480 --> 03:15:22.000]  and, uh, I can't wait for that show for these reasons. Exactly.
[03:15:22.040 --> 03:15:26.280]  There's so many different parts of the cannabis plant that influence its effect
[03:15:26.280 --> 03:15:28.640]  on you. And I think you're exactly right.
[03:15:28.640 --> 03:15:32.760]  Turpenes are a huge portion of the medical effect and the high.
[03:15:33.640 --> 03:15:35.800]  Um, you can feel it with that a hundred percent distillate.
[03:15:35.800 --> 03:15:37.160]  When you go from a ghost train,
[03:15:37.160 --> 03:15:41.080]  Hayes turps to an OG Kush turps, uh, that you're dunking it in,
[03:15:41.320 --> 03:15:45.400]  you can feel the high difference. It's the exact same THC, the exact same.
[03:15:46.520 --> 03:15:49.560]  Um, but when you add in the other stuff that doesn't affect the heights,
[03:15:49.600 --> 03:15:52.520]  the non-psychoactive stuff that, um,
[03:15:52.560 --> 03:15:57.080]  the materia that doesn't scare people, that's a final fantasy seven joke.
[03:15:57.440 --> 03:16:01.360]  They, uh, um, it completely changes the high. I,
[03:16:01.480 --> 03:16:05.360]  I was blown away the first time I experienced it. Um,
[03:16:07.080 --> 03:16:09.800]  it's all about, uh, all about the other pieces.
[03:16:10.000 --> 03:16:13.080]  Yeah. It's all about that entourage slash synergistic effect.
[03:16:13.080 --> 03:16:13.960]  However you want to call it.
[03:16:14.280 --> 03:16:18.240]  I love the term entourage effect is it's so descriptive.
[03:16:18.440 --> 03:16:21.880]  Yeah. Yeah. And it's true because when, like you said, when I smoked these up,
[03:16:23.000 --> 03:16:26.280]  where'd I put it? These ghost train Hayes turps right here. This is like,
[03:16:26.680 --> 03:16:30.000]  it's a, it's a bottle rocket on your dab. It's it, you take your dab and you're
[03:16:30.000 --> 03:16:32.200]  like, Oh, I'm high for my dab. And then a second later, you're like,
[03:16:32.480 --> 03:16:36.480]  I keep getting higher. And you're like, is this ever going to stop?
[03:16:36.880 --> 03:16:39.600]  But if you put the same dab and take some of that OG Kush,
[03:16:39.600 --> 03:16:43.240]  like you were talking about, you go, I'm going to get slow for a minute.
[03:16:43.280 --> 03:16:46.040]  And you start like you want to drool on yourself for a couple of seconds.
[03:16:46.040 --> 03:16:49.560]  But if you take the thing, it's called paradigm. I take that one.
[03:16:49.600 --> 03:16:53.360]  I get hyper from it. I'm like, Whoa, all that. I want to go run around now.
[03:16:53.760 --> 03:16:55.880]  Like, so they all have, there's something in those turpenoids.
[03:16:55.880 --> 03:16:59.120]  It's doing something completely different to your body and to your mind.
[03:16:59.640 --> 03:17:03.280]  It, uh, it just releases different, different chemicals,
[03:17:03.600 --> 03:17:07.760]  triggers different things. Um, but yeah,
[03:17:07.760 --> 03:17:11.280]  lab testing has changed. What we look for is, is consumers.
[03:17:11.760 --> 03:17:15.480]  And that's drastically changing the consumption experience. Absolutely.
[03:17:15.760 --> 03:17:20.800]  Well, I hope that allowing more PPMs and our concentrates does not encourage
[03:17:20.960 --> 03:17:23.080]  hash makers to lazy up. Uh,
[03:17:23.080 --> 03:17:25.720]  we're getting really good at concentrate making here in Colorado.
[03:17:25.720 --> 03:17:29.680]  So I hope that people just keep getting better shout outs of the people that are
[03:17:29.680 --> 03:17:33.520]  encouraging and learning and making better hash.
[03:17:34.160 --> 03:17:38.000]  I don't think anybody was real excited about this as far as yay.
[03:17:38.000 --> 03:17:41.320]  Now we can shave 45 seconds off our back oven cook.
[03:17:41.520 --> 03:17:44.520]  You know, when I first heard about this happening, I was like, Oh,
[03:17:44.520 --> 03:17:46.720]  what the fuck is happening? But now that I've read the article,
[03:17:46.720 --> 03:17:50.440]  I think I understand a little more and I'm not as nervous or paranoid about the
[03:17:50.440 --> 03:17:54.320]  increase. If it, if there's ever a BHL where I can taste butane in it,
[03:17:54.320 --> 03:17:56.920]  you can guarantee that that hash is going away.
[03:17:57.400 --> 03:18:00.080]  I was a little worried when it was only leafly was,
[03:18:00.080 --> 03:18:01.880]  was kind of reporting this and I was,
[03:18:02.000 --> 03:18:05.920]  I was happy to see the level of reporting they did,
[03:18:06.280 --> 03:18:09.480]  but because they're not a hardcore news org,
[03:18:09.800 --> 03:18:13.240]  you see that wander a little bit. Um, the guy,
[03:18:13.720 --> 03:18:17.400]  I'm guessing he just said it is something dumb during the interview and I've
[03:18:17.400 --> 03:18:19.920]  been interviewed a lot. I know sometimes stupid shit slips out.
[03:18:19.960 --> 03:18:21.840]  I say plenty of shit on this podcast.
[03:18:22.680 --> 03:18:27.360]  A good reporter will skip over the brain fart that you uttered on the
[03:18:27.360 --> 03:18:30.520]  record and stick to the on topic point. And,
[03:18:30.600 --> 03:18:32.600]  and this reporter got hung up on the,
[03:18:32.960 --> 03:18:36.160]  we might be talking about levels that consumers could smell or taste.
[03:18:36.800 --> 03:18:39.640]  And then he goes on to say how these levels are perfectly allowed in
[03:18:39.640 --> 03:18:40.920]  pharmaceutical products.
[03:18:41.360 --> 03:18:45.920]  If you can allow 5,000 PPM of butane in an abuterol inhaler,
[03:18:46.520 --> 03:18:49.560]  have a buterol inhaler people with that level of people,
[03:18:49.560 --> 03:18:51.320]  have they reported the taste?
[03:18:51.840 --> 03:18:56.280]  Like that would be part of the study that he's citing for the increase in it's
[03:18:56.280 --> 03:19:01.160]  not. But because he mentioned that to, um, a reporter who's not,
[03:19:02.280 --> 03:19:03.120]  um,
[03:19:03.640 --> 03:19:08.640]  obsessed with keeping the story clean and factual and got hung up on something
[03:19:09.160 --> 03:19:10.480]  dumb. The guy said at the beginning,
[03:19:11.040 --> 03:19:13.520]  and now half of people that read that story are like, man,
[03:19:13.520 --> 03:19:15.160]  I'm not buying hash Colorado anymore.
[03:19:16.160 --> 03:19:18.640]  You guys, you will know. Uh, and there are going to be lab tests.
[03:19:18.760 --> 03:19:21.480]  Can I see your container? You've got there, the Panama East coast, Panama.
[03:19:21.880 --> 03:19:25.920]  It's got the lab testing real well on here. This is some, uh,
[03:19:26.200 --> 03:19:30.160]  this is from Turpex and it is East coast, Panama chunk wax.
[03:19:30.160 --> 03:19:32.640]  It's labeled a hybrid. Uh, the next, uh,
[03:19:32.680 --> 03:19:35.360]  numbers listed on here are the MIP,
[03:19:35.360 --> 03:19:37.840]  which is the marijuana infused product license.
[03:19:37.840 --> 03:19:41.600]  It's got the license number of who made the hash. It's got the OPC number,
[03:19:41.600 --> 03:19:46.040]  which is the optional premises cultivation center. And it's got their ID number.
[03:19:46.040 --> 03:19:47.400]  That's where it was grown.
[03:19:47.600 --> 03:19:52.040]  Then it's got a batch number so that we know which batch of plants went into
[03:19:52.040 --> 03:19:54.040]  this mix by researching the batch number.
[03:19:54.040 --> 03:19:58.360]  We can tell you what plant tags were in here, which is each individual plant,
[03:19:58.800 --> 03:20:00.120]  which if they did it properly,
[03:20:00.960 --> 03:20:03.200]  like those are the numbers they used to do recall track.
[03:20:04.040 --> 03:20:06.880]  We can tell you if that plant has been applied a pesticide,
[03:20:06.880 --> 03:20:10.520]  we can tell you everything that plant has been sprayed with fed.
[03:20:10.520 --> 03:20:14.000]  We can tell you the date it was cut as a clone. The day it was moved into flower.
[03:20:14.280 --> 03:20:16.800]  We can tell you everything about mostly everything that about that plant,
[03:20:16.840 --> 03:20:21.520]  if it were properly documented by the grower and the metric supervisor at that
[03:20:21.520 --> 03:20:24.920]  facility. A lot of times she tries to pass through testing results or what's
[03:20:24.920 --> 03:20:25.960]  going to reveal the truth.
[03:20:26.200 --> 03:20:28.440]  So I'm looking at this container and it's got test results on it.
[03:20:28.960 --> 03:20:33.840]  It shows me how much CBGA, CBG, CBD, a CBD,
[03:20:33.840 --> 03:20:37.080]  THC, a THC and total cannabinoids are on here.
[03:20:37.480 --> 03:20:40.000]  Now I assume that in the very near future,
[03:20:40.000 --> 03:20:42.840]  they're going to include these particles per million testing on here.
[03:20:42.840 --> 03:20:47.160]  Those, those, uh, part of these rule changes were labeling changes. Um,
[03:20:47.360 --> 03:20:51.400]  that product, that's an old product. Okay. Um,
[03:20:51.440 --> 03:20:53.600]  most of the hash I've got is a couple of months old now.
[03:20:53.800 --> 03:20:56.120]  You kind of hold the hash for a minute. I do. I,
[03:20:56.120 --> 03:21:00.880]  I love stockpiling so that I can hit, you know, every time I go to dab,
[03:21:00.880 --> 03:21:03.800]  I've got 35 different flavors to use. It's pretty awesome. Um,
[03:21:04.560 --> 03:21:08.280]  it takes some planning and every now and then I realized that I've had a hash
[03:21:08.320 --> 03:21:10.800]  container for a year, 14 months.
[03:21:11.240 --> 03:21:14.760]  And then I make a point to smoke it all real quick so that it doesn't convert
[03:21:14.760 --> 03:21:17.880]  any further. If you need some help, let me know. I'm happy to.
[03:21:18.960 --> 03:21:22.920]  Old high THC stuff that's had, uh, had some aging to it is really good on
[03:21:22.920 --> 03:21:26.320]  inflammation and pain. Okay. Um, it converts into some other fun stuff.
[03:21:26.320 --> 03:21:27.560]  It's really good on inflammation and pain.
[03:21:27.560 --> 03:21:30.720]  It decarboxylates a little bit. It loses a decarboxyl group.
[03:21:31.600 --> 03:21:35.920]  It's a, it's a reason to stash and a reason not to worry if it gets a little
[03:21:35.960 --> 03:21:39.080]  old. But, uh, yeah, I'm a, I'm a hoarder,
[03:21:39.360 --> 03:21:43.480]  but this labeling isn't up to par and it's still better than 99% of the legal
[03:21:43.480 --> 03:21:47.400]  marijuana products you're going to find, um, sold in the U S. Yes. Um,
[03:21:47.440 --> 03:21:49.520]  same thing with this other hash container I've bought.
[03:21:49.520 --> 03:21:53.480]  I've worn this label down a little bit, but totally different container,
[03:21:53.480 --> 03:21:57.040]  totally different shape, totally different company, exact same information.
[03:21:57.480 --> 03:21:59.000]  And this one, if you look closely,
[03:21:59.000 --> 03:22:02.520]  you can see that the butane PPMs are listed on this label. Oh, nice.
[03:22:02.560 --> 03:22:07.560]  Can you read it still? Um, no, I can, I can read that. It used to be there.
[03:22:08.000 --> 03:22:09.520]  Um, and I actually,
[03:22:09.520 --> 03:22:13.520]  I believe it's triple zeros for both of the butane and the,
[03:22:14.280 --> 03:22:18.120]  uh, whatever that next butane was. Nice. Um,
[03:22:19.240 --> 03:22:23.240]  yeah. And I see propane. There was actually 2.75 left. Okay.
[03:22:24.200 --> 03:22:27.240]  That's not much. Um, not much at all, but it's for some live resin.
[03:22:27.240 --> 03:22:28.680]  So that's to be a little bit expected.
[03:22:28.680 --> 03:22:30.880]  There's going to be a little bit of residual solvent left in there.
[03:22:30.880 --> 03:22:33.240]  It's got a lot of moisture going on. So it'll hold on to some stuff.
[03:22:33.280 --> 03:22:36.920]  It's a real, real, uh, um,
[03:22:37.080 --> 03:22:41.640]  it's almost like a looks like sugary butter. Um, Plato sand.
[03:22:42.120 --> 03:22:43.960]  I don't know if you ever did the thing with, um,
[03:22:46.480 --> 03:22:48.760]  water and cornstarch, but if,
[03:22:48.760 --> 03:22:52.080]  if you ever like scratched your fingernail and scratch some of that out of
[03:22:52.080 --> 03:22:53.560]  there, it's about that consistency.
[03:22:53.720 --> 03:22:55.640]  I would totally dab that stuff by the looks of it.
[03:22:56.720 --> 03:22:59.200]  Um, I love, I love this company. I don't really want to shout him out.
[03:22:59.200 --> 03:23:00.520]  Cause we've done a lot of shout outs on this show,
[03:23:00.520 --> 03:23:03.280]  but they make some awesome live resident. I drive really far to get it.
[03:23:05.640 --> 03:23:09.040]  See that's sometimes in Colorado, people are like, but there's stores every,
[03:23:09.040 --> 03:23:11.960]  there are stores everywhere. Yeah. But I drive up to Denver to this one place.
[03:23:12.000 --> 03:23:14.800]  I drive from West Pueblo, not Pueblo West,
[03:23:14.800 --> 03:23:19.440]  but the West side of Pueblo to the very far North end of Denver. Um,
[03:23:19.480 --> 03:23:21.280]  it's like 126 miles.
[03:23:21.320 --> 03:23:26.320]  I drive past at least 300 marijuana stores to go to the one with the product
[03:23:26.840 --> 03:23:27.200]  I like.
[03:23:27.200 --> 03:23:30.800]  Yeah. Then I've, I do and have done, and we'll do the same thing in the future.
[03:23:31.440 --> 03:23:32.400]  Yep. There's only like,
[03:23:32.520 --> 03:23:35.200]  there are two or three dispensaries in Denver that I like to really shop at.
[03:23:35.280 --> 03:23:38.080]  Yep. Yep. All right. So you guys don't worry about it.
[03:23:38.080 --> 03:23:39.320]  It's not going to be that big of a deal.
[03:23:39.320 --> 03:23:42.080]  If you come to Colorado to buy some concentrates and you get these high
[03:23:42.080 --> 03:23:44.320]  numbers, you're going to notice if something's wrong.
[03:23:44.680 --> 03:23:46.920]  Don't let the PPM numbers freak you out.
[03:23:46.960 --> 03:23:50.800]  Like if you're buying shatter and it shatters,
[03:23:51.440 --> 03:23:53.280]  you don't have to worry about residual butane.
[03:23:53.320 --> 03:23:56.320]  You're probably doing all right. If it's on the shelf and they've got it,
[03:23:56.400 --> 03:23:59.200]  it's a store you're probably doing okay because they'll,
[03:23:59.240 --> 03:24:02.320]  they'll get concentrates that shit won't sell. It'll go on sale.
[03:24:02.360 --> 03:24:04.800]  They'll get rid of it the first time. They'll never buy it again.
[03:24:05.440 --> 03:24:08.120]  The employees are customers as well. Most of the time.
[03:24:08.680 --> 03:24:13.520]  The, I mean, as a consumer that doesn't really know a whole lot,
[03:24:14.000 --> 03:24:17.280]  the one thing you want to look out for is if you go to a shop and they go,
[03:24:17.640 --> 03:24:22.880]  I mean, just for example, this is 50, this is 55, this is 65. Oh,
[03:24:22.960 --> 03:24:27.240]  and we have these for 1999 be wary of the 1999.
[03:24:28.000 --> 03:24:30.480]  There's, there's a reason that there's that big,
[03:24:30.920 --> 03:24:34.240]  big discount for that one particular thing. It might be old.
[03:24:34.240 --> 03:24:37.720]  It might be about to pass out.
[03:24:37.720 --> 03:24:41.120]  Like a friend of mine had to throw out a whole bunch of product at his store
[03:24:42.200 --> 03:24:47.200]  because labeling labels expired and you can't just slap on a new label.
[03:24:47.400 --> 03:24:52.400]  That's terrible. Um, that, when that date's getting close,
[03:24:52.400 --> 03:24:56.720]  you'll watch it go from full price to half price to exactly what the shop paid
[03:24:56.720 --> 03:24:59.560]  for it to half of what the shop paid for it to please God,
[03:24:59.960 --> 03:25:03.400]  let me get any of my money back on it before, you know,
[03:25:03.400 --> 03:25:06.160]  the first or whatever hits. Um,
[03:25:06.320 --> 03:25:09.160]  and sometimes as a consumer that can be real helpful.
[03:25:09.160 --> 03:25:13.000]  And sometimes that just means that's the crap that they got tricked into buying.
[03:25:13.480 --> 03:25:17.120]  I just took a gnarly dab. Yeah, you did. The whole room just fogged up.
[03:25:17.360 --> 03:25:18.960]  I think I got half a dab off your dad.
[03:25:19.000 --> 03:25:22.040]  One thing I want to mention is something I've experienced in Colorado and I'm
[03:25:22.040 --> 03:25:23.600]  going to quit talking funnier in just a second.
[03:25:23.600 --> 03:25:27.280]  I feel like I'm going to sneeze and cough, but something that happens,
[03:25:28.120 --> 03:25:29.840]  a hat and extraction company.
[03:25:30.400 --> 03:25:33.080]  And we're just going to say that Mike and I have an extraction company.
[03:25:33.080 --> 03:25:37.160]  So Jeff and Mike's extraction company, we make extracts. That's our specialty.
[03:25:37.360 --> 03:25:42.360]  What we do is we go to dispensaries that have a grow involved in their,
[03:25:43.240 --> 03:25:44.360]  in their business plan.
[03:25:44.360 --> 03:25:48.560]  So there's a dispensary with a grow that grows product and that product goes to
[03:25:48.560 --> 03:25:49.640]  the dispensary for sale.
[03:25:50.000 --> 03:25:54.360]  What we offer to do as an extraction company is we will take either your buds or
[03:25:54.360 --> 03:25:57.600]  your trim, whatever material you want to give us.
[03:25:57.640 --> 03:26:01.160]  And we would gladly turn it into product for you for a price.
[03:26:01.440 --> 03:26:04.240]  There is usually, I don't know how much insider info I should give,
[03:26:04.240 --> 03:26:08.000]  but there's usually a deal worked out to where there's an industry range.
[03:26:08.120 --> 03:26:11.680]  I run it, we run it as a company and we split it with you 50 50.
[03:26:11.680 --> 03:26:13.600]  And then we get half of the product that's done.
[03:26:13.640 --> 03:26:15.240]  We package it and everything.
[03:26:15.560 --> 03:26:19.840]  And then we deliver your portion back to the store and you put it on the shelf
[03:26:19.880 --> 03:26:24.880]  for sale. And now the other way to do it is we run it and we sell it back to
[03:26:26.200 --> 03:26:28.040]  your dispensary at a price.
[03:26:28.040 --> 03:26:32.160]  And those prices vary widely depending on the company and the deals that you
[03:26:32.160 --> 03:26:34.200]  work out and how much product you're running.
[03:26:34.320 --> 03:26:38.200]  The quality of the product, the final product consistency,
[03:26:38.240 --> 03:26:41.720]  the popularity of the companies. If you're,
[03:26:42.000 --> 03:26:46.640]  if you were one of the top known grows and one of the top known extract
[03:26:46.640 --> 03:26:47.400]  companies,
[03:26:47.400 --> 03:26:51.480]  they'll run the shit for damn near free for each other so that they can both say
[03:26:51.480 --> 03:26:54.240]  ran by these companies and they both make a ton of fucking money.
[03:26:54.520 --> 03:26:56.200]  You'll usually see a pretty,
[03:26:56.280 --> 03:27:00.000]  a pretty tight range in hash pricing at the shop.
[03:27:00.560 --> 03:27:03.560]  Um, and I mean,
[03:27:03.560 --> 03:27:06.600]  it'll be like a 10 or $15 window in the,
[03:27:06.600 --> 03:27:11.200]  the cheapest one in that window is usually a company you've never heard of.
[03:27:11.200 --> 03:27:15.520]  Right. And that doesn't mean anything other than their new
[03:27:16.600 --> 03:27:20.880]  of them, of that company, of that range is a company called extracts Inc.
[03:27:21.440 --> 03:27:22.480]  They are not known,
[03:27:22.560 --> 03:27:27.000]  but I think lately they have been kicking out some ridiculously good concentrates
[03:27:27.000 --> 03:27:30.760]  at a very low price. Their packaging is plain.
[03:27:30.920 --> 03:27:32.360]  They don't have any advertising,
[03:27:32.400 --> 03:27:34.840]  but the shit is good once you crack that package open.
[03:27:34.960 --> 03:27:35.800]  Um,
[03:27:36.040 --> 03:27:41.040]  I've seen a half dozen new extract companies that I've never heard of before.
[03:27:41.680 --> 03:27:46.400]  Um, whether the first product I see from them is stellar. Um,
[03:27:46.480 --> 03:27:49.240]  incredible. So I had no idea that they were doing hash.
[03:27:49.240 --> 03:27:50.240]  They make some of the best.
[03:27:50.320 --> 03:27:53.360]  The first time I saw that it was actually granny that, uh,
[03:27:53.800 --> 03:27:58.200]  that had it, she opened it up and I was like, Holy shit. Um,
[03:27:58.680 --> 03:28:02.920]  there's a company down here, um, that, uh,
[03:28:02.960 --> 03:28:06.280]  they used to come into the shop. I was working out all the time. Um,
[03:28:06.320 --> 03:28:08.120]  that's brand new and just getting on their feet.
[03:28:08.120 --> 03:28:12.120]  And I've seen some really nice stuff from them lately. Um,
[03:28:12.920 --> 03:28:16.000]  it's nice to see this much quality come on, coming on the market.
[03:28:16.120 --> 03:28:19.920]  Well, something that, where I was headed with all of this is what can,
[03:28:19.920 --> 03:28:22.760]  if you find it, if you buy an extract from an extract company,
[03:28:22.760 --> 03:28:25.280]  say you get something, what do we name our company? I gave us a name,
[03:28:25.480 --> 03:28:28.360]  but Mike and Jeff's extraction, whatever I fucking call this earlier.
[03:28:28.640 --> 03:28:33.240]  If you buy a pro what we are running material grown by other dispensaries.
[03:28:33.560 --> 03:28:36.280]  So if we buy, I'm going to throw them right under the fucking bus.
[03:28:36.280 --> 03:28:38.400]  If we buy some material from Maggie's farm and run it,
[03:28:38.480 --> 03:28:42.240]  it's going to come out Brown and janky. It always does. Uh, I've heard,
[03:28:42.560 --> 03:28:46.520]  I've seen several extract companies run Maggie's farm stuff. It's not quality,
[03:28:46.520 --> 03:28:49.400]  something about their grow. I think they trim with the trim machine,
[03:28:49.400 --> 03:28:52.240]  which will fuck up your extract. I think they're using old material,
[03:28:52.240 --> 03:28:55.760]  which will fuck up your extract. Their stuff never comes out good. Uh,
[03:28:55.760 --> 03:28:59.400]  if you run stuff for a million different things that going into a grow that'll
[03:28:59.400 --> 03:29:02.680]  fuck up the extract. If you, if you run material from kind love,
[03:29:02.800 --> 03:29:06.200]  it always comes back fire. So it's not,
[03:29:06.280 --> 03:29:11.280]  it's a good portion of the hash work is up to the company that's running your
[03:29:11.840 --> 03:29:15.720]  extract, but a large portion of it is up to whoever grew that material,
[03:29:15.720 --> 03:29:18.960]  how long the material set around, how it was stored, how it was trimmed.
[03:29:19.760 --> 03:29:24.320]  That is a huge factor. So if you buy some extracts from a hash company,
[03:29:24.680 --> 03:29:29.280]  if Mike, and if you buy some Mike and Jeff extracts and it's shitty one time,
[03:29:29.280 --> 03:29:30.400]  and amazing one time,
[03:29:30.640 --> 03:29:34.960]  you kind of got to keep in mind to go look at this little OPC and MIP tag on
[03:29:34.960 --> 03:29:37.200]  here and see what the, uh,
[03:29:37.240 --> 03:29:40.320]  the OPC number is because that will tell you who grew it.
[03:29:40.800 --> 03:29:44.720]  It varies wildly batch to batch with, with some companies,
[03:29:44.760 --> 03:29:47.200]  other companies that are a little more established.
[03:29:47.640 --> 03:29:52.000]  I see less variety in the, in what they're putting on shelves. But, uh,
[03:29:52.560 --> 03:29:57.520]  for a while, like a year and a half ago, um, you would see, I mean,
[03:29:57.680 --> 03:30:01.800]  like A plus F plus. Yeah. Um,
[03:30:01.920 --> 03:30:03.280]  I mean in the same ship,
[03:30:03.320 --> 03:30:04.600]  it's like the products will be really,
[03:30:04.600 --> 03:30:07.960]  really good for a little while and then one guy will quit and everything just
[03:30:07.960 --> 03:30:10.400]  falls apart until he figured out what the new.
[03:30:10.480 --> 03:30:15.120]  And the other side of that coin is if you go to a shop and you see a strain you
[03:30:15.140 --> 03:30:20.200]  like, and you take a look at the hash and it's a quality that looks good to you
[03:30:20.200 --> 03:30:24.080]  and you take it home and you hit it and you love it and you want more,
[03:30:24.480 --> 03:30:26.960]  go back and get more right away. Yeah. Um,
[03:30:27.000 --> 03:30:30.760]  because just the nature of the industry, um,
[03:30:30.800 --> 03:30:32.880]  extract companies buy what's available.
[03:30:33.120 --> 03:30:37.840]  There's no guarantee that that strain is going to be made available to that
[03:30:37.840 --> 03:30:41.160]  extract company again, or then if it does,
[03:30:41.760 --> 03:30:43.960]  then it'll be that quality, um,
[03:30:44.000 --> 03:30:47.840]  that that same artist or, or team of people will be,
[03:30:47.880 --> 03:30:50.160]  we're doing the extraction in the same way.
[03:30:50.360 --> 03:30:53.560]  A lot of times that'll be a blend of flowers. Like we,
[03:30:54.240 --> 03:30:57.720]  the extractors will take a minimum of usually a thousand grams to run.
[03:30:57.720 --> 03:31:00.520]  They don't want less than a thousand grams out to what fits in their column.
[03:31:01.120 --> 03:31:05.000]  And you don't always have a, if you had a thousand grams of something,
[03:31:05.000 --> 03:31:08.360]  it would be buds and it wouldn't be a bunch of fucking shake to run. Right.
[03:31:08.360 --> 03:31:11.800]  So it wouldn't even happen. So maybe they're putting, what is this?
[03:31:11.800 --> 03:31:14.200]  You got East coast pineapple. That's a normal, that's a real strain.
[03:31:14.400 --> 03:31:16.160]  Maybe you got some blue dream and some golden.
[03:31:16.160 --> 03:31:17.840]  Go see it all the time when it's,
[03:31:18.240 --> 03:31:22.240]  when it sounds like two names swished together on the, uh,
[03:31:22.440 --> 03:31:24.640]  on the hash container. That's almost always what it is.
[03:31:24.640 --> 03:31:25.480]  We've been going for an hour,
[03:31:25.480 --> 03:31:27.520]  but you just put me on something that I want to bitch about.
[03:31:27.680 --> 03:31:31.480]  I hate it when extract companies do that. It bothers me as a medical product.
[03:31:31.480 --> 03:31:35.280]  We don't need extract companies creating fucking names out of their hash blends.
[03:31:35.440 --> 03:31:38.880]  It's this, I have the same issue with growers. Give it a minute,
[03:31:39.360 --> 03:31:41.400]  stabilize it, then rename it.
[03:31:41.880 --> 03:31:44.480]  Well, it's not, it's a renaming thing sucks. Uh,
[03:31:45.400 --> 03:31:49.320]  something that I find important. There are strains that are well-known. Uh,
[03:31:49.320 --> 03:31:52.960]  certain people rely on certain strains. Uh, I don't know what strain,
[03:31:53.000 --> 03:31:54.640]  grateful dog works well for you.
[03:31:54.800 --> 03:31:59.720]  I've got a blue headband and I have no fucking clue what that blue is from.
[03:31:59.760 --> 03:32:03.600]  It's probably blueberry or blue dream, but, but you don't know. Right.
[03:32:03.600 --> 03:32:08.200]  And I don't much prefer if it was the whole blend was labeled. Yeah.
[03:32:08.200 --> 03:32:12.880]  I wish that extract company would have put a blue dream and blue
[03:32:13.280 --> 03:32:15.600]  or headband so that we know what you're smoking.
[03:32:15.600 --> 03:32:17.200]  Cause if that works wonderfully for you,
[03:32:17.200 --> 03:32:21.400]  we can go find more blueberry or blue dream and more headband for you.
[03:32:21.920 --> 03:32:24.920]  But they're just, and now they're also kind of creating confusion because what,
[03:32:24.920 --> 03:32:29.320]  if somebody does have blue headband is a real flower and a real cross that a
[03:32:29.320 --> 03:32:31.640]  breeder will actually took their time to make.
[03:32:31.640 --> 03:32:34.920]  I think the part that kills for the consumer is, I mean,
[03:32:34.920 --> 03:32:36.400]  people are creatures of habit.
[03:32:36.640 --> 03:32:39.760]  They want to go to the store and they want their fucking six pack of Corona.
[03:32:40.200 --> 03:32:42.320]  And they want the same thing when they go to the dispensary,
[03:32:42.320 --> 03:32:45.920]  they want to walk in and get their, their three favorite things,
[03:32:45.920 --> 03:32:48.240]  just like they do at every other store in their world.
[03:32:48.720 --> 03:32:52.720]  And unfortunately when you walk into a marijuana store, it's yeah. I'm,
[03:32:52.880 --> 03:32:57.760]  I understand that you really loved that blue dream you bought last week. Um,
[03:32:57.800 --> 03:33:01.480]  it was, you know, a really good cut. It was real popular. We're out of that now.
[03:33:02.040 --> 03:33:06.080]  Um, here's where it falls in the range of genetics.
[03:33:06.120 --> 03:33:10.680]  Here's stuff that's similar. Good luck picking a new one. Um,
[03:33:10.720 --> 03:33:11.640]  and I mean,
[03:33:12.040 --> 03:33:15.560]  you can come back tomorrow and ask for more blue dream and you're gonna,
[03:33:15.920 --> 03:33:17.200]  and we ain't going to have it then either.
[03:33:17.400 --> 03:33:22.000]  But maybe in 54 days, yep. Um, eventually there will be more,
[03:33:22.000 --> 03:33:24.800]  but when that will be in, when it's stuff like hash,
[03:33:25.440 --> 03:33:29.160]  the store has almost no ability to,
[03:33:29.160 --> 03:33:33.600]  to call the extract company and be like, yeah, we need more sour diesel. Um,
[03:33:33.640 --> 03:33:37.120]  there might be some sour diesel available that they're about to run for you.
[03:33:37.440 --> 03:33:41.000]  There might not be any offered to that extract company for years.
[03:33:42.200 --> 03:33:45.280]  Um, unless they're growing the stuff they're processing, right.
[03:33:45.320 --> 03:33:48.960]  Or unless the shop is selling the material to the extract company,
[03:33:49.280 --> 03:33:53.880]  there's no way to guarantee that material is going to be there when it's time to
[03:33:53.880 --> 03:33:58.400]  re up a shipment. And so you're, you're kind of forced to go, um,
[03:33:58.440 --> 03:34:01.680]  find new stuff that you like, which is, you know, good and bad.
[03:34:01.680 --> 03:34:03.480]  I like it cause I like a big variety.
[03:34:05.480 --> 03:34:08.320]  If you were there, I get why I pissed so many people off.
[03:34:08.320 --> 03:34:10.640]  There are some people that are very, in my opinion,
[03:34:10.640 --> 03:34:14.280]  it's too specific about their THC and cannabis needs.
[03:34:14.280 --> 03:34:17.200]  I think that they're a little spoiled and they should just smoke some dope and
[03:34:17.200 --> 03:34:18.840]  relax. But some people like,
[03:34:18.880 --> 03:34:23.360]  I cannot smoke stuff with the word cush or this in it. Yep. They can,
[03:34:23.360 --> 03:34:25.360]  or I cannot smoke heavy sativas.
[03:34:27.880 --> 03:34:31.000]  As part of the evolutionary process where our brains are designed,
[03:34:31.440 --> 03:34:36.360]  designed to remember stuff that we didn't like or that we perceived
[03:34:36.360 --> 03:34:40.320]  is hurtful. And when it's stuff like foods and intoxicants,
[03:34:41.480 --> 03:34:44.080]  um, I mean, we, we hold onto those memories for life.
[03:34:44.120 --> 03:34:48.760]  Everybody's got that one alcoholic beverage that they got a hold of when they
[03:34:48.760 --> 03:34:51.520]  were 13, 14, 15. Yeah.
[03:34:51.560 --> 03:34:55.600]  I drank it like it was water and then threw up for a day and a half.
[03:34:56.040 --> 03:35:00.600]  They can't even see sour apple Pucker or banana red mad dog or whatever the
[03:35:00.600 --> 03:35:03.360]  fuck, um, without getting a little nauseous.
[03:35:03.680 --> 03:35:05.640]  You took that to a personal place, didn't you?
[03:35:05.640 --> 03:35:06.640]  No, it's actually,
[03:35:06.760 --> 03:35:11.240]  it, I doubt that person where those two references, um,
[03:35:11.320 --> 03:35:14.680]  are there things would ever listen to the show, but on the off chance,
[03:35:14.680 --> 03:35:18.480]  they do that laugh really hard when they hear that part. Um, but from,
[03:35:18.560 --> 03:35:23.560]  for me, it's Miller light. Um, MGDs shouldn't be drinking that piss anyway.
[03:35:23.680 --> 03:35:26.640]  I, it was what was there when we were that age.
[03:35:26.640 --> 03:35:29.320]  And a friend drank way too much of it. Um,
[03:35:29.360 --> 03:35:33.200]  he did the infamous puke fart and I was hung over for like five days.
[03:35:33.200 --> 03:35:35.880]  And now even when I see the label, I throw up in my mouth a little bit.
[03:35:36.360 --> 03:35:39.920]  And I used to have to go buy it for somebody in my life a lot. Um,
[03:35:39.960 --> 03:35:43.240]  and that was always a fun trip back from the store because I'm trying not to
[03:35:43.240 --> 03:35:45.960]  look at what's in the passenger seat cause it's making me nauseous.
[03:35:46.000 --> 03:35:48.480]  So I felt about rum. Rum was not my thing.
[03:35:50.240 --> 03:35:51.640]  It's the same thing with cannabis.
[03:35:51.640 --> 03:35:56.400]  Somebody smokes way too much cush one night and it's how much they consumed,
[03:35:56.400 --> 03:35:57.200]  how they consumed.
[03:35:57.200 --> 03:36:00.960]  It doesn't have anything to do with the strain or that it was an Indica. Um,
[03:36:01.000 --> 03:36:03.040]  but now every time they go to a dispensary,
[03:36:03.040 --> 03:36:07.520]  they make a big deal about how it can't be cussed to their bud tender. Um,
[03:36:07.720 --> 03:36:10.400]  or it can't say Durban in it that, no,
[03:36:10.400 --> 03:36:14.080]  I smoked too much Durban the first time I came to Colorado and I was alone in my
[03:36:14.080 --> 03:36:15.680]  hotel room and I ate that whole,
[03:36:15.920 --> 03:36:18.800]  that whole Brownie and then I smoked that Durban poison and it was just too
[03:36:18.800 --> 03:36:22.280]  much. I don't want that Durban. And it's like, dude, it was,
[03:36:22.440 --> 03:36:25.360]  found myself naked in the hallway asking for cheeseburgers.
[03:36:25.760 --> 03:36:28.800]  Didn't have nothing to do with what strain you picked. Um,
[03:36:28.880 --> 03:36:30.760]  but explaining that it's difficult.
[03:36:30.880 --> 03:36:34.000]  And then when they get there and the one thing they found that they really like
[03:36:34.000 --> 03:36:36.240]  you're out of and they have to start the process all over again,
[03:36:36.240 --> 03:36:39.360]  like it can be kind of headachy. I wish more people expected it.
[03:36:41.400 --> 03:36:43.880]  Oh, the cannabis market. We've got to regulate it a little bit better.
[03:36:43.880 --> 03:36:45.880]  So we've got the products that people want, but it's hard to get a,
[03:36:46.040 --> 03:36:50.280]  I have to remind myself how lucky we are here. The good shit sells out.
[03:36:50.280 --> 03:36:54.800]  That's how it goes. It's a first world problem in the extreme. Yeah.
[03:36:55.440 --> 03:36:56.280]  Um,
[03:36:57.040 --> 03:37:01.520]  and we're so spoiled here with, uh,
[03:37:01.560 --> 03:37:03.320]  our marijuana markets in the,
[03:37:03.320 --> 03:37:08.320]  the vast assortment of products that's available in that market. Um,
[03:37:09.440 --> 03:37:14.000]  I mean, prices are coming down, qualities going up, uh, selections going up.
[03:37:14.000 --> 03:37:14.840]  It's good for,
[03:37:14.960 --> 03:37:18.160]  it's good suppositories now you can move it.
[03:37:18.160 --> 03:37:19.440]  You can take your weed and everywhere.
[03:37:19.440 --> 03:37:22.440]  I put some weed pain cream on today before I left the house. I,
[03:37:22.520 --> 03:37:25.840]  I gave him both knees a coat before I started getting ready to come over for
[03:37:25.840 --> 03:37:30.440]  the show. Um, we've got suppositories, we've got lozenges,
[03:37:30.440 --> 03:37:33.880]  we've got sprays, we've got pills, we've got flowers.
[03:37:33.880 --> 03:37:38.320]  We've got a hundred different kinds of hash now. Um, when you go to this,
[03:37:38.680 --> 03:37:40.880]  when you went to a dispensary a year and a half ago,
[03:37:41.240 --> 03:37:45.360]  open was the only vape pen, um, on the shelf.
[03:37:45.720 --> 03:37:49.960]  Now there are hundreds of vape pen companies in with hundreds of different
[03:37:49.960 --> 03:37:53.720]  qualities, hundreds of different strain options. Um,
[03:37:53.800 --> 03:37:56.520]  I love that things are strain specific now too. That's so great.
[03:37:56.520 --> 03:38:00.680]  This strain specific edibles, strain specific vape pens. That shit is so great.
[03:38:00.680 --> 03:38:04.720]  Instead of just Indica, sativa or hybrid, you can get actual specifics.
[03:38:06.240 --> 03:38:10.920]  We move closer to the, the micro brew model every day,
[03:38:12.080 --> 03:38:12.920]  um, with the,
[03:38:12.920 --> 03:38:15.240]  the quality and the selection of products that we've got.
[03:38:15.240 --> 03:38:19.080]  And it's absolutely wonderful. And then I look at, uh, I mean,
[03:38:19.080 --> 03:38:20.160]  just next door to us,
[03:38:20.280 --> 03:38:24.440]  most of the States that surround Colorado are still under full prohibition
[03:38:24.880 --> 03:38:29.880]  where my friends scored a handful of good herb or good weed.
[03:38:31.360 --> 03:38:34.240]  Like that's what they know about it is that their friends scored it and it's
[03:38:34.240 --> 03:38:35.080]  good. Yeah.
[03:38:35.200 --> 03:38:38.000]  And that's the end of the information that they will ever have on it.
[03:38:38.040 --> 03:38:41.360]  I don't miss those days when he'd go to get some weed and they had some weed and
[03:38:41.360 --> 03:38:42.560]  you got whatever was there.
[03:38:42.960 --> 03:38:47.000]  It was a, that was one of the things I liked most about working the retail
[03:38:47.040 --> 03:38:49.280]  counter is watching people's faces light up.
[03:38:49.280 --> 03:38:51.880]  Like they were just learning about Santa as a small kid.
[03:38:51.880 --> 03:38:53.280]  I get to choose.
[03:38:55.280 --> 03:38:58.640]  I get to watch the numbers on the scale from my side and your side. That's
[03:38:58.640 --> 03:38:59.160]  awesome.
[03:38:59.160 --> 03:38:59.760]  Yep.
[03:38:59.760 --> 03:39:04.280]  It's so much fun watching people's faces light up when they see what the
[03:39:04.280 --> 03:39:08.440]  possibilities really are for this. Um, but then again,
[03:39:08.440 --> 03:39:11.840]  I read stuff like how it is on the East coast right now in a lot of places.
[03:39:11.840 --> 03:39:12.960]  And I just cringe.
[03:39:14.080 --> 03:39:14.880]  Well, that's why we're here.
[03:39:14.880 --> 03:39:18.920]  We're trying to educate everybody so that we can legalize places everywhere.
[03:39:18.960 --> 03:39:21.240]  Legalize cannabis. You guys, because we've been going for an hour,
[03:39:21.320 --> 03:39:22.840]  I can send them, start wrapping up this podcast.
[03:39:22.840 --> 03:39:24.440]  We can go for an hour and five minutes.
[03:39:24.920 --> 03:39:27.440]  I legalize it everywhere. I don't see any other,
[03:39:28.200 --> 03:39:30.320]  any better way to wrap the show. That's perfect.
[03:39:31.320 --> 03:39:34.000]  Other than asking for people to follow, follow Mike on Twitter,
[03:39:35.560 --> 03:39:39.440]  follow me on Twitter at GFYH podcast. Follow me on Facebook,
[03:39:39.760 --> 03:39:42.520]  go from your heart podcast. Of course, check me out on Instagram.

[03:39:47.400 --> 03:39:49.520]  it would be cool if you go to iTunes, uh,
[03:39:49.560 --> 03:39:52.600]  search for the grow from your heart podcast. You should definitely do that.
[03:39:52.800 --> 03:39:55.840]  Click on the little icon there, go to the ratings and review section.
[03:39:56.240 --> 03:39:59.960]  Give me a, leave me a review and give me a rating. So far,
[03:39:59.960 --> 03:40:02.240]  everybody has left me a five-star review.
[03:40:02.240 --> 03:40:06.280]  There are 39 or 45 star reviews at this point in time. Be cool.
[03:40:06.280 --> 03:40:10.200]  Be like everybody else. Throw me that five-star review. I'm not begging for it.
[03:40:10.200 --> 03:40:13.400]  Do what you think I deserve. Go for it. I'd love to see it. Uh, also Patreon,
[03:40:13.400 --> 03:40:15.440]  you guys, uh, don't forget about Patreon.
[03:40:15.480 --> 03:40:19.600]  Patreon is a service that allows you to financially support the podcast.
[03:40:19.600 --> 03:40:21.560]  All I'm asking for is help, uh,
[03:40:21.600 --> 03:40:26.200]  taking the cost of the website off of my back and maybe getting a little support
[03:40:26.200 --> 03:40:28.600]  from the listeners. The podcast will always be free. You guys,
[03:40:28.600 --> 03:40:31.680]  I'd love giving you this podcast, but if you'd like to go to Patreon and sign up,
[03:40:31.680 --> 03:40:33.480]  you can contribute as little as $1.
[03:40:33.720 --> 03:40:36.280]  And I don't think there's a limit to how many zeros you can put on there.
[03:40:36.920 --> 03:40:40.000]  So go for $1, go for a million dollars, however you'd like to do it.
[03:40:40.400 --> 03:40:42.320]  I'll give you a shout out to the podcast to say, thank you.
[03:40:42.640 --> 03:40:45.000]  I would love to see you contribute a million.
[03:40:45.000 --> 03:40:47.840]  I'll convince him to do something a little bigger than to shout you out on the
[03:40:47.840 --> 03:40:50.760]  podcast. I'll do a podcast about whatever you want. If you send me a million
[03:40:50.760 --> 03:40:53.520]  dollars, if you, we'll talk about whatever you want, a million bucks,
[03:40:54.000 --> 03:40:58.520]  anything a million bucks. Who wouldn't, right? Okay. Uh, patreon.com,
[03:40:58.560 --> 03:41:01.160]  no patreon.com slash grow from your heart. Check it out.
[03:41:01.280 --> 03:41:05.040]  I'm not asking anybody for a million dollars. $1 is plenty. Uh,
[03:41:05.080 --> 03:41:08.200]  if you cannot contribute, please keep listening to the podcast.
[03:41:08.200 --> 03:41:09.080]  I still appreciate you.
[03:41:09.080 --> 03:41:11.040]  There are a few people out there that will throw down a dollar.
[03:41:11.080 --> 03:41:12.200]  It'll help with what I'm trying to do.
[03:41:12.200 --> 03:41:14.760]  I'm trying to cover the cost of the website to keep the podcast coming to you.
[03:41:14.760 --> 03:41:17.880]  So that doesn't come out of my pocket. I can cover it, but I'd rather not.
[03:41:17.960 --> 03:41:21.200]  That's all I'm saying. Uh, if you find that you got some value from the show,
[03:41:21.280 --> 03:41:24.480]  go ahead and throw me a buck. If you can't do it, times are tough.
[03:41:24.520 --> 03:41:26.480]  I fucking get it. I'm the one asking you for money.
[03:41:26.480 --> 03:41:29.160]  I can't be mad that you don't have any extra money. I get it.
[03:41:29.200 --> 03:41:31.480]  I totally get it. But I appreciate the people that can contribute.
[03:41:31.800 --> 03:41:34.800]  Truly do appreciate that. You guys, I feel like I've been going on for a long time.
[03:41:34.800 --> 03:41:37.640]  Mike, I owe you a huge thank you for coming and doing two podcasts with me.
[03:41:38.160 --> 03:41:41.520]  We crushed it tonight. Yeah, we, we did a good job. I think you did a great job.
[03:41:41.520 --> 03:41:43.680]  I let you talk for a whole bunch cause you had a lot of shit on your mind.
[03:41:43.680 --> 03:41:48.680]  So I got to, uh, it's been a really fun couple of weeks in news.
[03:41:48.760 --> 03:41:50.880]  It has been a lot of scary news announcements,
[03:41:50.880 --> 03:41:53.640]  but there's been a lot of good ones too. Um,
[03:41:53.680 --> 03:41:55.600]  I cannot wait to see what the future brings.
[03:41:56.240 --> 03:41:58.560]  2017 is going to be interesting as shit.
[03:42:00.280 --> 03:42:01.440]  Not all in good ways.
[03:42:02.600 --> 03:42:05.960]  He just made 37 facial expressions trying to think about these.
[03:42:06.080 --> 03:42:09.000]  There's so many different possibilities for next year.
[03:42:09.080 --> 03:42:11.280]  It looks like on total recall and the dude's mask broke.
[03:42:11.520 --> 03:42:16.080]  The only thing that got less likely is the aliens making contact guaranteed.
[03:42:16.080 --> 03:42:17.600]  If they're watching us from above,
[03:42:18.240 --> 03:42:21.600]  they're continuing their policy of wait and see for the next four years.
[03:42:21.920 --> 03:42:22.760]  Other than that,
[03:42:22.920 --> 03:42:27.120]  pretty much every fucking other possibility from peace on earth to nuclear war.
[03:42:27.120 --> 03:42:31.720]  I got like 5% more likely, um, this year to last year.
[03:42:31.720 --> 03:42:34.560]  So yeah, it's going to be an interesting year for damn sure.
[03:42:35.080 --> 03:42:37.240]  It's absolutely going to be an interesting year.
[03:42:37.240 --> 03:42:40.200]  That dude's got the combination to the button.
[03:42:41.720 --> 03:42:44.000]  Dude. And the,
[03:42:45.200 --> 03:42:50.200]  the least confusing thing so far about Trump being elected is Trump getting
[03:42:50.240 --> 03:42:53.320]  elected, which is confusing in its own right.
[03:42:53.600 --> 03:42:58.520]  But all of the decisions he's made since election night have been more confusing
[03:42:58.520 --> 03:42:59.920]  than America choosing to elect him.
[03:43:00.240 --> 03:43:03.720]  You guys, if you're not following Trump's Twitter feed, just do it.
[03:43:03.720 --> 03:43:04.560]  That should have followed.
[03:43:04.560 --> 03:43:09.320]  My wife created it finally broke down and created a Twitter feed to follow it.
[03:43:09.320 --> 03:43:11.680]  Just to follow Trump. Just to follow. Go check it out. You guys,
[03:43:11.680 --> 03:43:13.000]  if you're pooping or whatever you're doing,
[03:43:13.280 --> 03:43:17.560]  just go give it a good follow and just like his tweets. Cause it's hilarious.
[03:43:18.760 --> 03:43:22.600]  Don't feel the need to like them. You should be following them.
[03:43:22.600 --> 03:43:25.400]  What you should do though, is go to Twitter and follow the girl from her podcast.
[03:43:25.400 --> 03:43:26.640]  You should definitely follow.
[03:43:28.320 --> 03:43:31.200]  You can find me on there. Also. I'm at Rasta jet four 20. I'd love it.
[03:43:31.200 --> 03:43:33.840]  If you'd follow me, I'd love it. I love all the social interaction.
[03:43:34.120 --> 03:43:36.480]  If you want to contact me and interact with me,
[03:43:36.760 --> 03:43:39.440]  or if you've got a product that you would like me to review and you don't want
[03:43:39.440 --> 03:43:41.440]  to reach out on social media, send me an email.
[03:43:41.440 --> 03:43:44.480]  It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com. You know, I'd love to hear from you.
[03:43:44.720 --> 03:43:47.800]  I am slowly working my way through all of the emails that people send me.
[03:43:48.120 --> 03:43:50.800]  I am overwhelmed by messages, but keep them coming. Cause I like it.
[03:43:51.200 --> 03:43:54.600]  I am going to get through all of them before the end of time.
[03:43:54.600 --> 03:43:58.560]  Hopefully I get to your problem in your garden before your garden is harvested.
[03:43:58.880 --> 03:43:59.840]  That's what I'm trying to do.
[03:44:01.320 --> 03:44:04.120]  The email is the best way to ask good questions. Yes.
[03:44:04.400 --> 03:44:08.360]  If you've got a grow question or a policy question or a good question for Jeff,
[03:44:08.360 --> 03:44:10.960]  that you'd like an answer on the show, email is the best way to do it.
[03:44:12.360 --> 03:44:17.360]  And I've repeatedly seen him contact and then drag the appropriate person to
[03:44:17.520 --> 03:44:22.200]  respond or the person that was requested to respond back on the show to get your
[03:44:22.200 --> 03:44:25.200]  question answered. And that's huge. What,
[03:44:25.400 --> 03:44:29.040]  what other podcaster is going to recruit people from Denver to come down and
[03:44:29.040 --> 03:44:31.000]  answer your, your organics questions?
[03:44:31.040 --> 03:44:34.360]  Sometimes I drive to Denver for them. It's 130 miles guys. Anyway,
[03:44:34.600 --> 03:44:37.360]  we're going to wrap up the show. It's been an hour and 10, an hour and 11 minutes.
[03:44:37.360 --> 03:44:39.840]  I want to thank everybody for listening. Mike, huge. Thanks again for coming.
[03:44:39.880 --> 03:44:41.440]  Happy to send you back home.
[03:44:41.480 --> 03:44:43.240]  I'm going to send you home back to the family real quick here.
[03:44:43.800 --> 03:44:46.640]  I hope you enjoyed it. Thanks so much for having me again.
[03:44:47.080 --> 03:44:49.720]  Dude, you're invited back. We'll have you millions of more times.
[03:44:50.240 --> 03:44:53.080]  We're going to make this podcast go a billion, a billion episodes.
[03:44:53.160 --> 03:44:55.280]  A billion episodes. That's a huge goal.
[03:44:55.640 --> 03:44:58.480]  We're going to need to get together more than a couple of times a month to record
[03:44:58.600 --> 03:45:02.080]  that buddy. Guys, I want to thank everybody for listening guys and gals.
[03:45:02.080 --> 03:45:04.480]  We are not ginger. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen,
[03:45:04.480 --> 03:45:07.400]  children of all ages and everything in between.
[03:45:07.400 --> 03:45:09.880]  I want to thank everybody for listening to the podcast. Um,
[03:45:09.920 --> 03:45:12.360]  who's getting a shout out this week. How about everybody?
[03:45:12.800 --> 03:45:16.120]  A shout out to the coming new year. That's what I want to give a shout out.
[03:45:16.120 --> 03:45:21.080]  That's a 2016 being over and 2017 starting. Yes. Shout out to new beginnings.
[03:45:21.680 --> 03:45:23.760]  You guys, thanks again for listening. I want to give you a huge shout out.

[03:45:25.160 --> 03:45:27.720]  take a fat dad and give your mom a hug for me.
[03:45:29.280 --> 03:46:24.060]  13 months old baby.
[03:46:25.060 --> 03:46:35.720]  When you believe superstition ain't the way.
[03:46:48.800 --> 03:46:49.800]  Wash your face in pain.
[03:46:49.800 --> 03:46:54.800]  Bread me up and fly.
[03:46:54.800 --> 03:47:00.040]  Do all that you can.
[03:47:00.040 --> 03:47:04.560]  Keep me in the deep.
[03:47:04.560 --> 03:47:14.590]  Keep me close to home.
[03:47:14.590 --> 03:47:17.590]  Keep me excited.
[03:47:17.590 --> 03:47:32.930]  The song superstition ain't the way.
[03:47:32.930 --> 03:47:35.930]  Nothing more to say.
[03:47:35.930 --> 03:48:06.570]  All right, podcast world.
