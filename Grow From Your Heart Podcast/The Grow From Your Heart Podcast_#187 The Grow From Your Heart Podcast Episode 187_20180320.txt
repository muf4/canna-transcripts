[00:16.890 --> 00:21.410]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community. It's time for episode number 187 of the
[00:21.410 --> 00:25.250]  Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and
[00:25.250 --> 00:28.490]  conversation. That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional
[00:28.490 --> 00:31.850]  grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis
[00:31.850 --> 00:34.610]  activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of
[00:34.610 --> 00:40.290]  cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you. I'm your host, my friends call me
[00:40.290 --> 00:43.590]  Ross the Jeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me. As always, I need to
[00:43.590 --> 00:46.370]  send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band for
[00:46.370 --> 00:50.350]  letting me use their music on my podcast. Big shout to Kat, Kud, and the entire
[00:50.350 --> 00:55.150]  Mystic Roots crew. Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you're all having a great day,
[00:55.150 --> 00:58.350]  evening, nighttime, morning, whatever time it is, wherever you are. I hope you're
[00:58.350 --> 01:01.830]  high as shit. Hope you're having a great afternoon. Across the table from me is a
[01:01.830 --> 01:06.150]  repute offender, Jesse's back. Welcome to the show, bro. Hey, thank you. What's up everyone?
[01:06.150 --> 01:09.030]  Hey, I hope everybody waved you. I hope they replied. I hope they're in their car
[01:09.030 --> 01:11.710]  and like, what's up bro? I hope they said something. I hope they feel weird now. I
[01:11.710 --> 01:14.390]  hope they're in public with their headphones on and said some dumb shit.
[01:14.570 --> 01:18.890]  I feel like I just did that. Man, thanks for joining me. For sure. Thanks for having me.
[01:18.890 --> 01:21.770]  Oh, anytime, dude. You're always welcome. I want you on the show every other
[01:21.770 --> 01:26.990]  episode if you can. We'll do Mike episode, one episode, you the next, Mike, you, Mike,
[01:26.990 --> 01:30.770]  you, and then granny occasionally. We could do that. All right. You guys heard it.
[01:30.770 --> 01:33.730]  You're all invited whenever you want. Lindsey will put you in the mix. Let's do
[01:33.730 --> 01:36.730]  some podcasts. Speaking of podcasting, I owe a huge shout out to my friend Bo
[01:36.730 --> 01:43.250]  Nellis. Bo did, Bo hosts a podcast called the Spliff Podcast and she gave me the
[01:43.270 --> 01:48.230]  hugest, longest shout out. She was talking about her favorite cannabis podcasts and
[01:48.230 --> 01:51.150]  I got a lot of love. So thank you. I appreciate it. If you're not already
[01:51.150 --> 01:55.230]  listening to the podcast hosted by Bo Nellis, go check that out. She spells it
[01:55.230 --> 02:00.910]  the, that's the Spliff Podcast. Uh, it's P O T C A S T. Please check that out.
[02:00.910 --> 02:04.150]  She's awesome. You will like it. It's a little bit different cannabis show. Uh,
[02:04.150 --> 02:08.110]  she's more like a kindergarten teacher that takes dabs. She's got a very soothing
[02:08.110 --> 02:11.270]  kindergarten teacher lady voice, but she's fucking awesome. She does a great
[02:11.270 --> 02:14.650]  podcast. I'm glad that she's part of our team and the cannabis education and
[02:14.650 --> 02:18.090]  podcasting community. So shout out to Bo. Go listen to her, please. Uh, we're
[02:18.090 --> 02:21.930]  going to do an outdoor episode. We're going to talk about preparing your outdoor
[02:21.930 --> 02:24.770]  garden. We can talk about a whole bunch of stuff. I've got a nice list of things,
[02:25.130 --> 02:28.550]  but before we get there, I'm going to stop the music. We're going to get serious.
[02:29.050 --> 02:32.250]  Uh, I was talking about distillate and Jesse just told me he's tired of
[02:32.250 --> 02:35.090]  distillate. He said he's kind of burned out on distillate, burned out on it.
[02:35.090 --> 02:39.290]  That's burned out. Huh? What the fuck dude? Seriously. I used to get terps all
[02:39.310 --> 02:44.030]  the time for basically free. All right. And I also went along with that.
[02:44.030 --> 02:46.190]  I got a bunch of distillate. So,
[02:46.590 --> 02:49.830]  so you were just now we've got to explain this to some people because not
[02:49.830 --> 02:54.350]  everybody is a spoiled Colorado hash. The distillate is hash.
[02:54.390 --> 02:58.110]  Basically it is really good hash. It is in the high nineties.
[02:58.110 --> 03:02.350]  It's 95% and above. I've seen 97 and 98, uh,
[03:02.350 --> 03:06.950]  97, 98% THC. It's the ingredient you want. It's the part you,
[03:07.010 --> 03:08.570]  it's just going to make you high as shit,
[03:08.590 --> 03:13.130]  but there's no flavor on there. A lot of things missing. Yeah. It's, uh,
[03:13.170 --> 03:16.890]  basically it's the moonshine equivalent of cannabis.
[03:16.970 --> 03:17.970]  That's a great way to put it.
[03:17.990 --> 03:21.770]  They have basically distilled off all of the ingredients into separate containers
[03:21.770 --> 03:25.290]  and they are selling you the THC so that you can dab that by itself. Yeah.
[03:25.490 --> 03:27.770]  The problem is there's no flavor. That's,
[03:27.850 --> 03:32.450]  let me explain why I'm kind of burned out on it because there's no flavor to it.
[03:32.570 --> 03:36.770]  Well, it has like a minty kind of flavor. Maybe.
[03:36.830 --> 03:40.550]  Maybe sometimes a woody popsicle stick flavor for sure. Sometimes.
[03:40.830 --> 03:45.190]  I've often wondered if that flavor actually just comes from the machinery that
[03:45.190 --> 03:47.110]  it was made in. Okay. I never thought of that.
[03:47.150 --> 03:50.790]  I've noticed that from different labs. Yeah, kind of. Absolutely.
[03:50.870 --> 03:52.950]  They're different. And then some of them don't have any flavors.
[03:52.950 --> 03:57.190]  Spherix did not have any flavor. Uh, Evo labs usually doesn't have any flavors.
[03:57.270 --> 03:59.510]  I haven't tried Evo yet. This brand here, I forgot what they're called.
[03:59.510 --> 04:03.070]  It looks like a P and a J on the logo. Uh, it's pure distillate pure. I think.
[04:03.230 --> 04:03.510]  Uh,
[04:03.510 --> 04:06.930]  sometimes they have a flavor that is very close to the strain that I have
[04:06.930 --> 04:10.970]  purchased. It has a representative flavor. Like I recognize it a little,
[04:11.250 --> 04:14.450]  but it's not as strong as it should be. So you're an old school pot smoker.
[04:14.450 --> 04:17.370]  You've been smoking weeds since, yeah, since you, before we should ever admit.
[04:17.770 --> 04:22.650]  I smoke way more weed than I do. Okay. So you miss when you smoke distillate,
[04:22.650 --> 04:26.450]  you're missing that, that terp, the plant flavor, the terps from the hash,
[04:26.770 --> 04:29.650]  the terps from the plant, you're missing all that. I get it. Um,
[04:29.690 --> 04:32.210]  and then also when I said I'm kind of burned out on it, I,
[04:33.030 --> 04:37.190]  I would rather have like a really good life resin than distillate personally.
[04:37.310 --> 04:41.430]  Okay. And I am the opposite. Okay. Uh, lately I like for my,
[04:41.930 --> 04:46.430]  my medical smoking reasons and my recreational smoking reasons, both. Uh,
[04:46.430 --> 04:50.230]  I want a sativa that gives me energy and makes my eyes bug out. Uh,
[04:50.310 --> 04:53.550]  like almost makes me feel like I'm on almost wired too much caffeine,
[04:53.590 --> 04:56.190]  too much coffee, maybe a little slight stimulant, but I like a dab,
[04:56.230 --> 05:00.390]  almost a psychedelic dab. And the distillate is the quickest, easiest way to get
[05:00.410 --> 05:02.770]  there. It's right to the point. Most definitely. Yeah. It's just,
[05:02.770 --> 05:06.330]  here's the one that makes your eyes bug. It's too much for a lot of people.
[05:06.330 --> 05:09.770]  You see people take that THC distillate dab and they just go, Oh shit.
[05:09.810 --> 05:11.970]  You can see them panic and turn red and sweat. Yeah.
[05:11.970 --> 05:16.090]  I've made a few people turn white with distillate. Yeah. You get pale,
[05:16.250 --> 05:18.610]  blood sugar drops. You can't breathe right. You go weird.
[05:19.010 --> 05:21.410]  I can take the hugest dabs of distillate.
[05:22.130 --> 05:26.810]  I can take of the big dabs. I can take just to list the easiest.
[05:26.810 --> 05:29.330]  Cause it's the cleanest. Right? Yeah. That's exactly what it is.
[05:29.330 --> 05:32.590]  I feel like I can heat up a banger and let it cool to just the right temp and
[05:32.590 --> 05:35.150]  just score almost half a gram in there. And I don't even cough.
[05:35.390 --> 05:38.070]  I can just pull that half gram. Like it's nothing. I blow out the biggest,
[05:38.110 --> 05:39.950]  thickest, richest cloud. And I don't even cough.
[05:40.230 --> 05:41.590]  I've seen you do one gram dab.
[05:41.590 --> 05:45.910]  So I bet you could probably do a gram and a half a distillate dab.
[05:46.030 --> 05:47.950]  I've done a gram of the distillate and it was no problem.
[05:47.990 --> 05:50.550]  So a gram and a half might be fun. I'm honestly,
[05:50.550 --> 05:53.790]  I don't know if I'm getting older or if I'm working too much and not resting or
[05:53.790 --> 05:55.870]  if I'm not hydrating or if I've been dabbing too hard,
[05:55.870 --> 05:58.390]  but my lungs are starting to get tired of the large dabs.
[05:58.650 --> 06:01.650]  I said on one episode, I was like, it's time to retire the big dabs.
[06:01.650 --> 06:05.130]  And I fucking lied. I've been doing big dabs. I still hang out with Lindsey.
[06:05.130 --> 06:08.450]  I still hang out with granny. Uh, they love to give me giant dabs.
[06:08.450 --> 06:09.330]  When I go places,
[06:09.330 --> 06:12.730]  people know who I am and they think it's polite and the kindest thing they can do
[06:12.730 --> 06:16.770]  is just to give me the biggest dab they can muster up. And I'm so high after that.
[06:16.770 --> 06:18.690]  I'm like, you fucking just ruined my day,
[06:18.690 --> 06:20.530]  but I want to be polite and take the dab with you.
[06:20.970 --> 06:23.050]  So everyone dabs me out and ruins me. It's fun.
[06:23.490 --> 06:26.570]  I'm glad I have a reputation as a lightweight dabber.
[06:26.950 --> 06:31.390]  Right. Yeah. Yeah. I hate getting forced in big dabs. It's, Oh fuck.
[06:31.830 --> 06:32.910]  Ruin your day. Shit.
[06:33.590 --> 06:36.510]  It's a, it's fun and terrible at the same time.
[06:36.990 --> 06:41.070]  It's like that the best struggle ever is like, I'm good at life.
[06:41.070 --> 06:46.070]  I've got it figured out. Why not slightly handicap myself and see if I could do
[06:46.070 --> 06:47.390]  this high out of my mind.
[06:47.390 --> 06:50.350]  It's like playing on the expert level, you know, yeah. You know,
[06:50.350 --> 06:53.270]  the video game center, you're going up in difficulty.
[06:54.130 --> 06:55.570]  No guns. I'm going to choke everybody.
[06:57.530 --> 07:02.090]  Just knives and jokes. No guns. All right. So, um, distillate,
[07:02.090 --> 07:04.090]  we talked about that. We give a shout out to our friend Bo Nellis.
[07:04.090 --> 07:07.650]  I think it's time to segue into talking about growing cannabis outdoors.
[07:08.490 --> 07:09.050]  Nice.
[07:09.050 --> 07:13.290]  This is probably hopefully going to be episode one in a series of outdoor grow
[07:13.310 --> 07:16.330]  lessons. Although I guess there's one more thing I should mention.
[07:16.330 --> 07:18.730]  I was going to save this for another episode by myself and not steal all the
[07:18.730 --> 07:23.430]  thunder on a dual episode, but I should announce this. I, today, yesterday,
[07:23.430 --> 07:27.710]  and today took on the position of being the grow manager at three rivers
[07:27.710 --> 07:28.550]  organics.
[07:28.630 --> 07:31.570]  So I've been talking about the project and the thing I've been doing and keeping
[07:31.570 --> 07:34.230]  it secret. That's what's been keeping me so damn busy.
[07:34.550 --> 07:38.950]  So I am the manager now of a large growth facility in Pueblo West, Colorado,
[07:39.270 --> 07:41.150]  three rivers organics is a really cool facility.
[07:41.150 --> 07:43.390]  Shout out to all my friends and coworkers there.
[07:43.390 --> 07:46.550]  Shout out to the cool ass management, everybody that helps us out.
[07:46.850 --> 07:50.210]  That's what's keeping me busy. I know Jesse stays busy all the time.
[07:51.050 --> 07:55.090]  I want to do an episode about why we move from facility to facility so frequently
[07:55.090 --> 07:55.930]  and why,
[07:56.210 --> 07:59.330]  why that happens in this industry because people probably don't understand.
[07:59.650 --> 08:01.410]  I'm going to write that down. Actually.
[08:01.810 --> 08:05.050]  We could get a couple other people in here. Um,
[08:05.090 --> 08:08.690]  I actually think I'm in a longterm home where I'm at.
[08:09.730 --> 08:11.890]  I don't even think I am. I know I am.
[08:11.970 --> 08:15.370]  So you know when you work somewhere and you know that one day you're going to
[08:15.370 --> 08:17.510]  have to just get your shit and leave. You don't have,
[08:17.530 --> 08:20.550]  there's that like employee cubby area and the employee fridge.
[08:20.550 --> 08:22.090]  You don't leave your shit in the fridge when you leave.
[08:22.090 --> 08:23.150]  You're like, I gotta get my Tupperware.
[08:23.150 --> 08:25.550]  Cause I don't know if I'm going to come back tomorrow. Uh, I,
[08:25.590 --> 08:28.830]  my last two grow facilities where I worked, I had that feeling.
[08:28.830 --> 08:30.630]  I was like any day I might just say, fuck it,
[08:30.630 --> 08:33.750]  not even come here because it's not a hundred percent legit for what I'm doing.
[08:34.070 --> 08:36.070]  I'm not satisfied this place. Uh,
[08:36.150 --> 08:39.150]  I've got stuff in the cubby hole at work right now. Like I feel like it is,
[08:39.190 --> 08:41.390]  it's going to be a longterm thing. Yeah. They keep me happy. They,
[08:41.690 --> 08:44.090]  they've listened to me. They, they're not, uh,
[08:44.130 --> 08:47.970]  the owners know they're not pot growers and they don't try to be pot growers.
[08:48.170 --> 08:51.130]  That's one of the important things. It's the hardest part. Yeah.
[08:51.530 --> 08:55.610]  They're business owners. Yes. That's a job in itself. Yeah.
[08:55.610 --> 08:59.010]  Do payroll and manage a business and I'll manage the grow and they,
[08:59.030 --> 09:00.050]  they respect that.
[09:00.050 --> 09:03.050]  They see that I've got the grow under control and I know that I don't want to
[09:03.050 --> 09:06.690]  fuck with payroll and we all respect our boundary. Yeah.
[09:06.810 --> 09:08.970]  So we're going to do a whole episode about that.
[09:08.990 --> 09:10.450]  Let's save some of that for a whole episode.
[09:10.450 --> 09:11.670]  Let's talk about growing weed outdoors.
[09:11.670 --> 09:13.470]  But that was the other thing I wanted to mention you guys.
[09:13.470 --> 09:16.150]  That's why we're so busy. So this will be the start of a series hopefully,
[09:16.150 --> 09:19.390]  but I am now the manager of a large facility. I've got a crew to manage.
[09:19.390 --> 09:21.910]  I've got other people to answer to facility wise.
[09:22.390 --> 09:24.430]  When the owners are like how many pounds are coming? When's it coming?
[09:24.430 --> 09:26.950]  What strains do we got? How much of this do we need to order?
[09:26.990 --> 09:29.110]  I've got a lot of shit to handle now. So I'm going to be a little busier,
[09:29.270 --> 09:30.750]  but we're going to keep the podcast coming.
[09:30.750 --> 09:33.190]  It's just going to be harder for Jesse and I to time each other out to get to
[09:33.390 --> 09:36.110]  the series we want to do, but it's going to happen for sure. Yeah.
[09:36.110 --> 09:40.150]  We've got faith in this. So this episode is going to be about outdoor preparation.
[09:40.210 --> 09:43.050]  We're not going to talk too much about all of the things you need to do during
[09:43.050 --> 09:43.570]  the season.
[09:43.570 --> 09:46.850]  We're going to talk about how to be prepared because I think preparing is
[09:46.850 --> 09:51.210]  probably like a good 50% of the battle. Oh, easily. It's a, it'll make or break.
[09:51.450 --> 09:54.610]  Absolutely. Yeah. All right. Without a doubt. That's,
[09:54.610 --> 09:58.970]  it's the most important thing and it's the thing people overlook the most. Yeah.
[09:59.130 --> 10:00.250]  I have a plan you guys,
[10:00.290 --> 10:03.370]  just because you're growing outdoors and it's basically free.
[10:03.410 --> 10:06.490]  If you've got space and the time it's damn near free,
[10:06.490 --> 10:08.730]  you're going to have to buy just a few plants. Yeah. Yeah.
[10:09.110 --> 10:11.790]  Don't get carried away. Don't get greedy because it's free.
[10:12.150 --> 10:14.430]  If you grow three small plants that nobody can see,
[10:14.430 --> 10:17.870]  you've got way more chance of getting away with that than growing one giant
[10:17.890 --> 10:21.910]  fucking plant that everybody can see. So be careful. Don't get greedy.
[10:21.990 --> 10:23.510]  Remember this is meant to be medicine.
[10:23.530 --> 10:25.830]  This wasn't put here on this earth to be a profit plant.
[10:25.830 --> 10:28.710]  This was put here to be a medicine for everybody.
[10:28.890 --> 10:33.230]  So think about that when you're growing it, be kind and don't, I'm skipping ahead,
[10:33.230 --> 10:35.150]  but don't fucking shoot anybody for your weed. Please.
[10:35.150 --> 10:38.110]  If they're stealing your weed, don't shoot them. That's the number one rule.
[10:38.210 --> 10:40.850]  Don't shoot them for weed. That looks bad on us. If they're that,
[10:40.850 --> 10:42.730]  if they're that down to see, if you want to go out there and fight them,
[10:43.050 --> 10:45.810]  you can fight them. I'm cool with that. Please don't kill anybody for cannabis.
[10:45.850 --> 10:49.730]  If they shoot at you first too. I mean, by all means defend yourself. Yes.
[10:49.810 --> 10:51.810]  Well, if you feel capable of doing such things,
[10:52.330 --> 10:54.330]  unless you want to just fucking run when they shoot, go for it.
[10:54.350 --> 10:56.530]  Let them have your pop. That's probably the best thing to do. Yeah.
[10:56.530 --> 10:58.770]  To give them the weed. If they're going to shoot at you, if they,
[10:58.930 --> 11:01.570]  if they're down to kill you for that, we let them have it. You better. Yeah.
[11:01.650 --> 11:03.250]  They probably want it a little more than you do.
[11:03.610 --> 11:07.250]  If you better damn sure, make sure they really want to kill you.
[11:07.350 --> 11:10.590]  And that, uh, and you only got a few seconds to think about that.
[11:11.590 --> 11:15.870]  It does not feel like any seconds. It's a deliver, die thought it's shoot or,
[11:15.870 --> 11:18.830]  don't shoot. And that's it. So please put, yeah, we're, we've,
[11:19.030 --> 11:22.190]  please don't kill anybody. Bad karma on it either. Yeah.
[11:22.230 --> 11:24.830]  We don't want to read the word marijuana grow and murder.
[11:25.150 --> 11:27.870]  And I hate doing that. We don't want those things in the paper together.
[11:28.030 --> 11:30.650]  If somebody comes in your house, do whatever the fuck you have to do outdoors.
[11:30.950 --> 11:33.030]  Just let them take that shit. Grow more next year. Yeah.
[11:33.390 --> 11:36.790]  That's my opinion on that. All right. Let's get to something less grim. Um,
[11:37.390 --> 11:39.910]  I felt I made a little outline here. We made an outline.
[11:40.130 --> 11:42.470]  I feel that location is super important.
[11:42.470 --> 11:44.590]  It's one of the first things to think about location.
[11:44.590 --> 11:49.110]  What is your goal with this grow and find a location that fits that goal or make
[11:49.110 --> 11:52.790]  your location suit your needs. You can't overload your location.
[11:52.990 --> 11:54.190]  You can't get too carried away.
[11:54.670 --> 11:59.670]  You're not going to bust off your 99 plant extended plant count in your backyard
[11:59.710 --> 12:03.830]  in your suburban area. It's going to fail. I promise.
[12:04.190 --> 12:07.030]  There's actually a dude that lives on the East side of Pueblo that every year
[12:07.310 --> 12:11.350]  he just walks to his backyard and throws a handful of seeds and post pictures of
[12:11.350 --> 12:12.190]  it to the internet.
[12:12.470 --> 12:14.790]  And I think it's amazing that he doesn't get in trouble for it,
[12:15.030 --> 12:18.110]  but he does that way too many plants outside thing. And it's a jungle mess.
[12:18.150 --> 12:21.630]  It needs to be cleaned up, put them in some pots, control it. But I just,
[12:21.650 --> 12:24.350]  I just think it's amazing that he does that and post those pictures and gets
[12:24.350 --> 12:26.930]  away with it. So let's, let's talk about location.
[12:26.930 --> 12:29.750]  You want somewhere that is safe and secure. Um,
[12:29.950 --> 12:33.030]  what do I mean by safe and secure? You don't want anybody getting into it.
[12:33.430 --> 12:36.390]  I wrote down cops. You need it safe and secure from cops.
[12:36.390 --> 12:38.570]  I don't know if it's legal where you are. Either way,
[12:38.810 --> 12:42.610]  the cannabis cannot be seen by anybody. If somebody driving by can see it,
[12:42.770 --> 12:46.090]  you are now illegal. Uh, also thieves,
[12:46.250 --> 12:48.290]  you have to be safe and secure from thieves.
[12:49.170 --> 12:52.690]  Most people are good on as people until they see big fat,
[12:52.690 --> 12:54.410]  shiny buds with no one watching them.
[12:54.530 --> 12:58.050]  Pot plants turn honest people into douchebags real fucking quick,
[12:58.090 --> 13:00.530]  real quick, really quickly. It's one of the,
[13:01.770 --> 13:04.970]  there's few things I've seen that do do that to people quicker.
[13:07.330 --> 13:10.890]  Oh, I'm not. Yeah. I was taking a drink and I'm glad cause I may have spouted out
[13:12.170 --> 13:16.570]  um, another thing I want you to make sure that will not ever come in contact with
[13:16.570 --> 13:18.370]  your cannabis plants is children.
[13:18.770 --> 13:22.490]  If young kids are walking to school to the park through your neighborhood and
[13:22.490 --> 13:27.490]  they pass pass pass by your cannabis crop and they decide to steal a bud,
[13:27.970 --> 13:30.810]  you just fucked up bad. Please don't let that happen.
[13:30.810 --> 13:33.210]  That is one of the biggest things that Colorado was afraid of.
[13:33.210 --> 13:36.430]  Everyone's all worried about the children. What about the children?
[13:36.950 --> 13:39.670]  Keep your pot plants away from the children, please.
[13:39.910 --> 13:43.030]  I remember reading a story about that in the Denver post several years ago.
[13:43.110 --> 13:47.830]  Yeah. Uh, there was a show a long time ago on TV about, it was like weed cops.
[13:47.830 --> 13:52.050]  It was basically cops, but all they were doing was going to weed grows in places.
[13:52.430 --> 13:55.750]  And one of them, they got in trouble because the kids, uh,
[13:55.950 --> 13:58.950]  pulled a couple of buds off of a plant on their way to school and took it to
[13:58.950 --> 14:00.830]  school and was showing it off. Like, look what I got.
[14:00.830 --> 14:01.830]  And the teacher's like, where'd you get that?
[14:01.890 --> 14:03.490]  And he's like, I just pulled it off the plant on the way.
[14:03.930 --> 14:07.050]  And so the cops came and they're like, show us where. And that kid was like here.
[14:07.490 --> 14:09.730]  And they knocked on the door and they busted him. Like, dude, you got plants.
[14:09.730 --> 14:10.570]  You can't do this.
[14:10.570 --> 14:13.770]  I remember that that's actually where I saw that. Um,
[14:13.810 --> 14:18.210]  it happened up in somewhere up in Denver. Yeah. It was definitely the fucking idiot.
[14:18.210 --> 14:22.490]  Had that shit planted like right next to a fucking jogging trail behind like a
[14:22.490 --> 14:24.370]  four foot fucking privacy fence.
[14:24.390 --> 14:27.170]  So that when we talk about location that is safe and secure,
[14:27.210 --> 14:29.370]  that's a fucking fail. Don't do that.
[14:29.710 --> 14:32.710]  That's a perfect example of what not to do. Um,
[14:33.150 --> 14:35.390]  if you can have an outdoor grow that is not enclosed,
[14:35.390 --> 14:38.670]  I recommend buying a dog run, go to Lowe's and get the 10 by 10 dog run.
[14:38.670 --> 14:41.190]  It's a 10 by 10 area that is six or eight feet tall.
[14:41.510 --> 14:44.470]  Build that shit to the best of your ability, put a lock on it.
[14:44.470 --> 14:46.990]  And now your cannabis is pretty safe.
[14:47.150 --> 14:51.150]  And those, those dog runs are highly modifiable. You can do,
[14:51.270 --> 14:53.990]  and you can put two of them together. You can put three of them together.
[14:53.990 --> 14:56.030]  You can do all kinds of crazy shit with them.
[14:56.030 --> 14:59.350]  It would work really well if you got the 10 by 10 prebuilt dog run and the
[14:59.370 --> 15:02.590]  pre-made eight by eight greenhouse and just put the eight by eight greenhouse
[15:02.610 --> 15:04.150]  inside the 10 by 10 dog run.
[15:04.350 --> 15:06.670]  And then you're super compliant with the law in Colorado.
[15:06.670 --> 15:09.630]  You were in a greenhouse and you were locked and secured. That's cute.
[15:09.790 --> 15:13.630]  And then put your dog inside of that 10 by 10 run and just make them run around
[15:13.630 --> 15:16.230]  the grow all day, not inside of it. And then no one can get in there.
[15:16.230 --> 15:19.550]  It's like having a moat or a goat or a crocodile. Yeah.
[15:22.190 --> 15:26.310]  I said moat. I was thinking goat before you said moat. So
[15:27.290 --> 15:31.210]  this is, this is going to be a fun podcast or already is a fun podcast.
[15:31.410 --> 15:34.850]  They're fucking scary. Especially the big ones. Really? Yeah. I've never,
[15:34.890 --> 15:36.770]  male goats I should say. Okay. Yeah.
[15:36.850 --> 15:38.690]  All the goats I've interacted with have been in a pen,
[15:38.930 --> 15:42.610]  so I've never had to feel it threatened. There's always a fence. All right.
[15:42.610 --> 15:45.530]  So safe secure from cops, thieves and children.
[15:45.530 --> 15:47.370]  Please do not let the kids get ahold of your weed.
[15:47.670 --> 15:52.050]  Also think about your location. Is it legal? If you have a legal grow area,
[15:52.050 --> 15:53.650]  make sure if you want to,
[15:53.830 --> 15:57.830]  I encourage you to find out all of the rules for outdoor growing in your County,
[15:57.970 --> 16:02.710]  in your local area and follow them to the best of your ability so that that way
[16:02.710 --> 16:06.030]  if something goes wrong and the cops show up at your house, you can say rule a,
[16:06.070 --> 16:08.550]  followed it. Rule B followed it. I'm not a dickhead.
[16:08.550 --> 16:12.870]  I'm trying to grow medical marijuana to help myself. Do your due due diligence.
[16:12.910 --> 16:15.670]  Yes. If it's not legal where you are,
[16:15.950 --> 16:19.230]  I cannot encourage you to grow outdoors. Please follow the rules,
[16:20.270 --> 16:21.790]  all that stuff that I'm supposed to say legally.
[16:21.790 --> 16:24.190]  But if you do choose to grow outdoor like a fucking adult,
[16:24.190 --> 16:26.850]  because you can do that because you're an adult, uh, wherever you are,
[16:27.130 --> 16:30.530]  be careful. Don't have your plants visible. Keep them below the fence.
[16:30.890 --> 16:33.370]  Camouflage them some way. Grow some other plants around them.
[16:33.410 --> 16:36.490]  Don't tell anybody if, uh, yeah,
[16:37.050 --> 16:42.050]  all those if you're growing in an illegal area and if you are growing in an
[16:42.250 --> 16:44.250]  illegal area, don't do it at your house.
[16:45.010 --> 16:47.290]  It don't grow in your backyard illegally. Yeah. Go find,
[16:47.290 --> 16:51.130]  go find somewhere in the forest and don't take your girlfriend with you.
[16:51.130 --> 16:54.070]  Don't take your best friend with you. Don't take anybody with you.
[16:54.350 --> 16:57.910]  Anybody that that relationship can end and somebody could be salty for you.
[16:58.070 --> 17:01.830]  Don't take them. They don't need to know. Yeah. And let, yeah.
[17:01.950 --> 17:04.790]  Little tip trip though. Tip though. Um,
[17:05.150 --> 17:06.990]  if you aren't growing on your property,
[17:06.990 --> 17:10.430]  it's really hard for them to convict you. If you do happen to get busted,
[17:11.030 --> 17:12.790]  they have to have film of you going there. Yeah.
[17:12.950 --> 17:16.390]  And even that's hard to hold up. Right. Cause you could have just driven past.
[17:16.390 --> 17:17.990]  Yeah. So yeah.
[17:18.370 --> 17:22.290]  Don't, don't take a lot of advice from two dudes with beards at my table though.
[17:23.490 --> 17:27.170]  They're tips. It's not legal. Yes, absolutely. It's illegal advice.
[17:27.250 --> 17:31.210]  If it's, if it's illegal where you are, be careful. Don't be careful with your
[17:31.210 --> 17:34.570]  pictures. A lot of pictures have GPS tracking in the pictures.
[17:34.570 --> 17:36.330]  There's geo tagging in your pictures.
[17:36.530 --> 17:38.850]  That stuff just incriminates you too. If you do.
[17:39.090 --> 17:42.010]  Don't take your cell phone because it's a tracking device. If you were growing,
[17:42.490 --> 17:44.490]  you guys do not grow on federal land.
[17:44.490 --> 17:48.190]  A lot of people back in the day love to grow in national forests.
[17:48.630 --> 17:51.950]  Do not do it. You will get caught. It's an extra crime.
[17:52.150 --> 17:55.030]  You were growing on federal land. They're extra pissed off.
[17:55.050 --> 17:57.310]  They want to make an example of you. They're going to fuck with you.
[17:57.630 --> 17:59.750]  Don't do it. Don't take your phone with you to the grow.
[17:59.750 --> 18:03.110]  If you're growing outdoors, it's a GPS tracking device.
[18:03.150 --> 18:06.270]  Don't take pictures there. If you do be very careful.
[18:06.390 --> 18:10.750]  Don't tell anyone we've said that three or four times. Don't tell anyone. Yeah.
[18:10.790 --> 18:12.790]  Yeah. Yeah. Don't, don't hint of where it is.
[18:12.970 --> 18:16.490]  Find another excuse that of why you're disappearing. Don't you?
[18:16.510 --> 18:18.810]  Don't even tell them I have to go water my grow. Just be,
[18:18.850 --> 18:22.850]  I have to take my mom to church. Like just find a good reason to be gone.
[18:23.810 --> 18:25.010]  All right. So, so yes. No,
[18:25.010 --> 18:27.490]  if you are finding somewhere to grow and it's outdoors,
[18:27.490 --> 18:29.850]  whether it's a legal or illegal spot, if it's your backyard,
[18:29.850 --> 18:32.890]  or if it's down by the Creek shot, it's my buddy James. Uh,
[18:33.090 --> 18:35.850]  you need to be able to get water there. You're going to need a lot of water,
[18:36.050 --> 18:38.610]  not a lot of water in the beginning, but it's going to get hot in the summer.
[18:38.930 --> 18:42.650]  It's going to get 90 degrees everywhere this summer in America, in North America,
[18:42.710 --> 18:47.150]  you're going to need to be getting a lot of water to that grow very frequently,
[18:47.150 --> 18:50.590]  possibly every single day. So make sure you can get water there.
[18:50.590 --> 18:53.910]  Make sure you've got, if you're doing it, a big outdoor grow far from your house,
[18:53.910 --> 18:57.670]  you need to get water in a vehicle to that place legally,
[18:57.870 --> 18:59.710]  legally and not get pulled over,
[18:59.710 --> 19:03.870]  not get trailed with a bunch of water up a mountain side and then come back with
[19:03.870 --> 19:05.470]  no water and no excuse.
[19:05.630 --> 19:08.350]  If you're doing a large outdoor grow, um,
[19:08.850 --> 19:11.330]  I highly recommend irrigation system.
[19:11.450 --> 19:15.370]  It will reduce the amount of water that you need, that you consume.
[19:15.650 --> 19:17.570]  You can probably well, well-designed.
[19:17.690 --> 19:20.770]  You can probably only do that in a legal grow. So be careful.
[19:20.770 --> 19:22.810]  You don't want to be setting up too much, uh,
[19:23.010 --> 19:26.570]  for irrigation and pumps and toys in an illegal grow. Be very careful.
[19:26.650 --> 19:28.410]  So here's a trick on that.
[19:28.810 --> 19:33.290]  Go to Lowe's and they have the irrigation experts and they actually,
[19:34.130 --> 19:38.170]  it's a pretty good, what they use is a pretty good program that can, uh,
[19:38.170 --> 19:40.470]  quickly design an irrigation system,
[19:41.070 --> 19:44.910]  draw your plants out on a grid and tell them that they're cherry trees.
[19:45.850 --> 19:49.670]  And, uh, you know, just put square plants for your little grid and, you know,
[19:49.670 --> 19:51.550]  tell them you need to, uh,
[19:52.190 --> 19:55.670]  irrigation heads at each one of the plants and they can totally design it.
[19:55.690 --> 19:57.350]  They'll give you a part list and everything.
[19:57.510 --> 20:00.350]  I was going to do an episode on building an irrigation and drip system.
[20:00.350 --> 20:04.550]  And I had no thought of modifying it for outdoor use in my plan.
[20:04.570 --> 20:07.150]  So you just made that episode a little bit longer. Thank you.
[20:07.570 --> 20:08.730]  It's next on the list. I just,
[20:08.730 --> 20:10.730]  we keep getting more interesting shit to talk about.
[20:10.810 --> 20:14.730]  There's a little more to outdoor irrigation systems. Um,
[20:15.130 --> 20:18.330]  but mostly just because of the materials difference you're using.
[20:18.330 --> 20:22.330]  Cause it needs to be a more rigid. Yeah, absolutely. Better PVC, thicker tubing,
[20:22.770 --> 20:26.170]  longer lasting stuff. All right. So think about getting water to it.
[20:26.210 --> 20:29.170]  Think about building yourself a, an irrigation system.
[20:29.570 --> 20:33.410]  Now here's something that is more applicable to the backyard environment,
[20:33.790 --> 20:35.810]  space for plants, room for plants.
[20:35.810 --> 20:39.430]  Think about how big your plants are going to grow and make sure you give them
[20:39.430 --> 20:42.590]  plenty of space apart. You don't want them touching. When they start touching,
[20:42.590 --> 20:45.390]  they know it and they'll stop growing wider. They're like, Oh,
[20:45.390 --> 20:46.750]  I don't want to touch you. I don't want to touch you.
[20:46.750 --> 20:48.770]  I'm going to grow up and they're going to quit going out.
[20:48.830 --> 20:50.110]  Cause they don't want to smother each other.
[20:50.430 --> 20:53.090]  When they do smother each other is when you start getting powdery mildew.
[20:53.310 --> 20:56.510]  That's where the bugs hide. That's where you get bug mold or bud mold.
[20:56.870 --> 21:00.750]  So give them plenty of space. Um, it's,
[21:00.750 --> 21:04.310]  it's very when you plant these plants in the late spring or early summer and
[21:04.330 --> 21:06.170]  they're just little tiny plants. Uh,
[21:06.690 --> 21:10.190]  it's hard to imagine how big they're going to get. And if you're doing it right,
[21:10.190 --> 21:11.730]  they're going to get fucking gigantic.
[21:11.750 --> 21:16.210]  Especially if you're planting in like late April or very early may, uh,
[21:16.290 --> 21:20.370]  which is here in Southern Colorado, that's the early shoulder of the season. So,
[21:21.290 --> 21:26.290]  um, by the time they start flowering in late July, they are going to be,
[21:26.530 --> 21:29.210]  I mean, depending on how well you planned everything out,
[21:30.090 --> 21:31.330]  they'll be fucking huge.
[21:31.410 --> 21:33.010]  10 feet tall. Yeah. Literally.
[21:33.670 --> 21:37.950]  Um, I, I like planning plants on like six or eight foot centers.
[21:37.990 --> 21:39.750]  That's what I was going to say is six or eight foot centers,
[21:39.750 --> 21:43.750]  which means that plant needs six feet for itself to grow.
[21:43.910 --> 21:46.550]  You want that plant's going to be six feet around itself.
[21:46.710 --> 21:48.190]  If you're going to put another plant next to it,
[21:48.190 --> 21:51.710]  you want a foot gap and then another six foot space for that plant,
[21:51.730 --> 21:53.150]  at least a foot gap, maybe two,
[21:53.150 --> 21:55.630]  cause you want to walk through it and carry a five gallon bucket to water.
[21:56.470 --> 21:58.030]  So leave yourself space. That's what we're saying.
[21:58.510 --> 22:02.190]  I don't underestimate the growth. It's going to be amazing. You guys,
[22:02.330 --> 22:05.170]  if this is your first outdoor grow, you're going to be blown away.
[22:05.410 --> 22:09.530]  If you're growing behind a six foot fence. Um,
[22:09.630 --> 22:13.570]  if you plant really early, it is, the plant is going to go over the fence.
[22:13.610 --> 22:16.730]  You're going to have to learn to either tie it down or create an outdoor
[22:16.730 --> 22:18.610]  trellis or plant a little bit later.
[22:18.730 --> 22:23.410]  Or trim it or many things. I don't recommend extending the fence up.
[22:24.450 --> 22:26.570]  Um, I've seen people do that and it's always a red flag.
[22:26.610 --> 22:30.810]  Yeah. It's anybody that is a ripper knows anybody that's a grower knows anyone
[22:30.830 --> 22:34.670]  that works with the DEA knows anyone that lives in Colorado knows we've caught
[22:34.670 --> 22:37.230]  on. We see all that shit all the time. All right.
[22:37.230 --> 22:39.190]  So make sure you have plenty of room for your plants.
[22:39.390 --> 22:42.710]  The next thing I want to talk about is don't plant your plants between the
[22:42.710 --> 22:46.030]  garage, the fence, the back of the house and the shed.
[22:46.470 --> 22:49.870]  Put them in an open area where you can get airflow, where you can get wind,
[22:49.910 --> 22:54.630]  where you can get sunshine, where you don't have too much shade. Um,
[22:54.750 --> 22:57.030]  what side of the mountain do we want to plan on? If we were ideally,
[22:57.030 --> 22:58.950]  if we had owned a mountain, do you want to be on the East?
[22:59.250 --> 23:01.450]  South facing, South facing slope. Yeah.
[23:01.610 --> 23:04.810]  So plan on the Southern facing slope if you can, if you've got a mountain,
[23:04.810 --> 23:07.010]  that's where you're going to get the most sunshine.
[23:07.850 --> 23:11.610]  You'll want to also plan like on the South sides of buildings and stuff like
[23:11.610 --> 23:16.730]  that. It's, it's always the South side of anything in this hemisphere is the
[23:16.730 --> 23:18.290]  sunniest part of it. So,
[23:18.650 --> 23:20.610]  so don't don't plan on the North side of the house. If you,
[23:20.610 --> 23:22.450]  if you're in the backyard, you're going to have to deal with what you can,
[23:22.450 --> 23:25.610]  but try, try to get on the South side so that you're not getting shadows all day.
[23:25.990 --> 23:26.430]  For sure.
[23:26.430 --> 23:29.590]  Try to get those plants where they get as much sunshine as they can.
[23:29.590 --> 23:32.270]  From the minute the sun comes up to the minute the sun goes down,
[23:32.270 --> 23:34.990]  those plants can eat up all the sunshine you can give them.
[23:34.990 --> 23:36.750]  You can't over sun a cannabis plant.
[23:37.790 --> 23:41.230]  Not at all. Yeah. If you feel like it's getting burned,
[23:41.250 --> 23:44.550]  something else is going on. Unless you just, just put it outside.
[23:44.910 --> 23:48.030]  Right. Yeah. That first few days maybe. And then it'll pull out hopefully.
[23:48.910 --> 23:52.270]  I feel like, uh, if you had outdoor plants that had a problem,
[23:52.310 --> 23:54.830]  you could almost if hypothetically, if it were feasible,
[23:54.830 --> 23:57.330]  you could just carry them outside and put them under the sun for four or five
[23:57.330 --> 24:00.570]  days and they'll heal themselves. They'll go, Oh, that's what I was missing.
[24:00.650 --> 24:03.770]  I've seen that happen a lot of times. I've used that trick a lot. Okay.
[24:03.810 --> 24:05.650]  I just don't like taking them back in. Yeah.
[24:05.970 --> 24:09.130]  I feel like I just brought in every bug in the neighborhood. When I do that,
[24:09.410 --> 24:11.970]  I actually feel like they get cleaner when they go outside.
[24:12.370 --> 24:13.850]  So the bugs are like, Oh, cool nature.
[24:15.050 --> 24:17.890]  Depends on your local, you know, if you,
[24:17.970 --> 24:20.730]  if you've just got a bunch of dirt in your backyard and you don't have grass or
[24:20.750 --> 24:24.290]  vegetables and you know, there's no beneficial life back there anyways,
[24:24.590 --> 24:27.670]  it's not, you know, it's a different story. All right. So,
[24:28.310 --> 24:29.430]  but like when I do it,
[24:29.510 --> 24:33.990]  it's at one of two places that is very thriving,
[24:34.750 --> 24:36.790]  uh, fauna. So yeah, you're kind of a farm boy.
[24:36.790 --> 24:39.150]  So I'm sure everything is just flourishing where you are.
[24:41.070 --> 24:44.630]  So the sun is King is my point. You guys make sure those plants get enough sun,
[24:44.670 --> 24:47.510]  plenty of sun, all of the sun. They want more. If you're like,
[24:47.510 --> 24:50.790]  it's getting enough and it's kind of shaded, it wants more. It can take it.
[24:50.810 --> 24:51.650]  Don't worry.
[24:52.310 --> 24:56.310]  Another thing, if you plant on North sides of buildings,
[24:57.190 --> 24:59.990]  the Northeast side of a building is going to be the darkest side.
[25:02.150 --> 25:06.430]  Or just the North Northeast side of anything's going to be the darkest that
[25:06.650 --> 25:10.230]  planning and that can actually cause your plants to bloom early.
[25:11.230 --> 25:13.950]  All kinds of weird stuff will happen because the building's going to start
[25:13.950 --> 25:17.030]  blocking off light at a certain period of the day.
[25:18.150 --> 25:20.590]  Once the light gets below a certain intensity,
[25:20.590 --> 25:23.450]  even though the sun may still be up, it's off to the plant.
[25:23.970 --> 25:27.790]  And that can trigger flowering, which may be something, you know,
[25:27.790 --> 25:30.730]  depending on your situation, you might be able to use that to your advantage,
[25:30.730 --> 25:33.090]  actually. So just something to keep in mind.
[25:33.610 --> 25:36.410]  Keep that in mind when you're watching that plant and trying to judge your
[25:36.430 --> 25:40.330]  harvest window. So it's going to change everything on the opposite side of that.
[25:40.330 --> 25:41.530]  I wrote down streetlights,
[25:41.830 --> 25:44.050]  try not to plant your plants directly under streetlights.
[25:44.070 --> 25:45.450]  My friend Henry a few years ago,
[25:45.450 --> 25:48.250]  plants and plants outdoors and he called me over. He's like, dude,
[25:48.250 --> 25:50.350]  it should be done and look at this. And it was still,
[25:50.350 --> 25:53.070]  the pistols are all bright white and the calyxes aren't fluffy yet.
[25:53.390 --> 25:55.710]  And I'm looking at it going, what the fuck is going on?
[25:56.070 --> 25:58.390]  And I thought, look straight up above you. And I looked up,
[25:58.430 --> 26:00.590]  there's a streetlight directly above these plants.
[26:00.590 --> 26:02.590]  So when the sun sets that streetlight comes on,
[26:02.870 --> 26:04.470]  those plants never got a dark cycle.
[26:05.030 --> 26:06.970]  I've learned through the years,
[26:07.110 --> 26:12.030]  it does have to be pretty damn close to now that they're using
[26:12.110 --> 26:15.510]  led streetlights in a lot of places, right? They don't even affect the plant.
[26:16.290 --> 26:19.330]  Okay. Well, this guy was in a smaller city and I'm sure he had the old antique
[26:19.350 --> 26:21.970]  HPS for sure. He was using a grow light for a streetlight.
[26:21.970 --> 26:26.130]  Basically I had a problem growing somewhere with a streetlight,
[26:27.090 --> 26:29.090]  um, years ago and a whole bunch of plants.
[26:29.090 --> 26:32.410]  They didn't finish and we actually had one herm really bad. Yeah.
[26:32.450 --> 26:33.690]  It'll do that because of the light.
[26:34.090 --> 26:37.090]  And uh, it was also a combination from a security light,
[26:37.850 --> 26:41.010]  but uh, a girl happened at that place again, this last summer,
[26:41.010 --> 26:45.130]  security guides lights gone in the streetlight across the streets and led light.
[26:45.230 --> 26:46.270]  And they had no problems.
[26:47.590 --> 26:51.430]  The best solution for the streetlight, if you can't plant somewhere else,
[26:52.470 --> 26:56.510]  uh, probably a pellet gun. It's probably the way to solve that problem.
[26:56.550 --> 26:59.430]  There's been so much illegal advice given in this episode.
[26:59.430 --> 27:03.390]  We are not lawyers and, um, Oh, it's cause it's episode one, eight, seven.
[27:03.550 --> 27:07.750]  Oh yeah. Step in a gangsta. All right.
[27:07.750 --> 27:09.990]  So we've talked about where to grow your plants and where not to grow your
[27:10.010 --> 27:14.110]  plants, uh, outdoors, lots of space, some more safe, uh,
[27:14.170 --> 27:17.290]  some more with a lot of sunshine and away from streetlights.
[27:19.010 --> 27:22.250]  I just thought of something with shooting out streetlights. I'm in. Um,
[27:22.270 --> 27:23.490]  so if they shoot them out,
[27:23.690 --> 27:27.210]  they're going to send a man out to fix it and he's going to go up in a cherry
[27:27.210 --> 27:29.610]  picker and he'll be able to see all the backyards around.
[27:30.050 --> 27:34.530]  So just keep that in mind. All of the backyards. Yeah. And then yeah,
[27:34.730 --> 27:37.850]  don't do that. Sorry. Wrong idea. You guys don't do that bad fail.
[27:38.090 --> 27:40.730]  Not even going to edit that. We're just going to admit that I fucked up. All
[27:40.730 --> 27:43.090]  right. Don't shoot out the streetlights. I never said that. Sorry, Mike.
[27:44.930 --> 27:49.730]  All right. You kind of touched on this a second ago. Timing timing is crucial in
[27:49.730 --> 27:53.970]  everything. Um, estimated date to put the plants outside.
[27:53.970 --> 27:57.010]  If you're in Colorado, late April, early May,
[27:57.970 --> 28:00.210]  if you want them to not grow monstrous,
[28:00.450 --> 28:04.490]  you can wait until the beginning of June. For sure. Um,
[28:04.650 --> 28:08.930]  I grow at several places outdoors typically in a season or help friends.
[28:09.050 --> 28:11.450]  We'll call it that. Um, no,
[28:11.870 --> 28:16.870]  but I've grown in many different locations and each location has a different
[28:17.270 --> 28:21.630]  start date for varying reasons. So, um, you know,
[28:21.950 --> 28:23.990]  if I don't want the plants getting monstrous,
[28:24.470 --> 28:28.950]  I'll put plants out later in the season. Um,
[28:29.350 --> 28:30.430]  if, if you know,
[28:30.430 --> 28:33.990]  they can grow free and get to 12 feet 16 foot tall,
[28:34.370 --> 28:39.350]  I try to get them out as early as I can, you know, late April. So, um,
[28:40.010 --> 28:42.650]  think about that. Think about your timing, uh,
[28:42.690 --> 28:44.850]  based on the situation where you're going to be growing up.
[28:45.210 --> 28:49.210]  If you've got room for monstrous plants, be vegging now. Yeah. Yeah. Fuck yeah.
[28:49.250 --> 28:52.890]  Like start vegging indoors under T five lights or under HPS lights or under
[28:52.890 --> 28:55.410]  Gavitas or whatever you have. Just get them going now.
[28:55.730 --> 28:59.930]  We're doing outdoor work this year. And that's, um, I took clones a month ago.
[29:00.450 --> 29:03.530]  They're in two gallon pots right now. Right. Just getting topped and getting
[29:03.530 --> 29:06.610]  trained. Huge biggest plants I've ever done. There you go. Get,
[29:06.750 --> 29:09.270]  get the sticks cracked up. So they're nice and neural. I love it.
[29:09.270 --> 29:13.470]  We're all legal. So we can just extend the fence up with the fucking tarps.
[29:15.750 --> 29:18.590]  Don't talk too much about tarps. Cause I want to do another episode about light
[29:18.590 --> 29:20.630]  depth. So let's not, let's not say tarp too much.
[29:20.630 --> 29:23.070]  We'll teach people too much on accident. All right.
[29:23.070 --> 29:25.910]  So you can put the plants outside based on the size you want.
[29:25.910 --> 29:27.310]  If you want bigger plants, put them out earlier.
[29:27.310 --> 29:30.870]  If you want smaller plants, put them out later. Yeah. Uh, you can judge that.
[29:31.430 --> 29:34.390]  Uh, you're going to have to grow once or twice outside to see how amazingly they
[29:34.410 --> 29:35.730]  grow. Cause they take off. You guys,
[29:36.050 --> 29:38.250]  you've never seen growth indoors like you will see outdoors.
[29:38.610 --> 29:42.610]  Um, something to, I mean, I think it probably goes without saying,
[29:42.610 --> 29:47.090]  but if more shady advice, um,
[29:47.130 --> 29:50.970]  if you're growing in a place where size is an issue, um,
[29:51.010 --> 29:52.610]  instead of having a couple of big plants,
[29:52.630 --> 29:57.210]  you may consider according to your legal laws and local laws and everything.
[29:57.210 --> 30:01.210]  But, um, you can always increase the amount of plants you're, you know,
[30:01.250 --> 30:03.490]  more smaller plants. Right. Yeah. Yep.
[30:03.590 --> 30:06.550]  Well in Colorado, they're thinking about limiting us on Mike's going to want to
[30:06.550 --> 30:08.950]  do an episode about this. They're going to limit our number. Uh,
[30:08.990 --> 30:11.910]  no matter what your medical card says to either 12 or 18 plants.
[30:12.150 --> 30:14.230]  So that means we're going to have to start growing monsters. Yeah.
[30:14.510 --> 30:15.470]  Monster plants.
[30:15.830 --> 30:20.550]  You could do the right grower could do a hundred pounds off 12 plans outdoors.
[30:20.550 --> 30:24.030]  So there are people that just set their phone down and scratch their heads
[30:24.050 --> 30:25.590]  going, what the fuck? Wait, what?
[30:27.310 --> 30:30.630]  12 outdoor monsters is that's some serious fucking plant.
[30:30.810 --> 30:34.810]  Right. So put them out. Uh, we talked about when to put them out, uh,
[30:34.850 --> 30:36.890]  estimated flowering start date. You guys,
[30:36.890 --> 30:40.170]  everything we're talking about on timing is going to be Colorado based in
[30:40.170 --> 30:42.650]  California. It's going to be different in Maine. It's going to be different in
[30:42.650 --> 30:45.210]  Michigan. It's going to be different in Kentucky. It'll be different. Uh,
[30:45.250 --> 30:47.170]  North or South of the equator is going to be different.
[30:47.170 --> 30:49.370]  What we're talking about is Colorado. This is what we know.
[30:49.530 --> 30:51.090]  We apologize that we're so specific.
[30:51.450 --> 30:53.810]  Let me add to that a little where it changes.
[30:53.850 --> 30:57.650]  It doesn't change so much from East to West. It changes from North to South.
[30:57.790 --> 31:02.790]  Right. So say Albuquerque plants are going to go into bloom earlier down there.
[31:04.510 --> 31:07.150]  And then you come up the road to Pueblo and they're going to be a little bit
[31:07.150 --> 31:11.670]  later up to Denver and so on and so forth as you go North and travel,
[31:11.990 --> 31:13.110]  you know, between the poles.
[31:13.390 --> 31:17.230]  All right. That makes total sense. It makes complete sense. Uh, so when,
[31:17.230 --> 31:19.630]  when should we expect them to flower around here in Pueblo?
[31:20.350 --> 31:25.350]  Um, depending on strain anywhere from mid to late July,
[31:25.890 --> 31:30.770]  um, to early, mid August for most strains, um,
[31:31.650 --> 31:34.570]  seems like some Indica's go faster. Uh,
[31:36.730 --> 31:41.730]  like really wild land race. The Tiva's, um, go pretty early too,
[31:41.810 --> 31:43.770]  but, uh, they finished much, much later.
[31:43.770 --> 31:46.250]  It takes golden goat a long time to kick into flower.
[31:46.490 --> 31:49.450]  She does not want to flower outdoors. She's like, I'm not ready yet.
[31:49.490 --> 31:52.930]  Flow on the other hand, you're like flower and flows like I'm done now.
[31:53.270 --> 31:57.230]  Flow is a great, great, uh, strain to grow.
[31:58.350 --> 32:00.150]  If you can only pick a few to grow outdoors,
[32:00.150 --> 32:03.470]  the Colorado cut of flow that goes around is a great outdoor cut to grow the
[32:03.470 --> 32:06.790]  blueberry. A lot of DJ short stuff does wonders outdoors.
[32:06.990 --> 32:11.350]  If you know what you're doing. Um, I've never done it, but, uh,
[32:11.390 --> 32:13.070]  I understand the principle behind it.
[32:13.070 --> 32:16.630]  You could actually harvest flow twice outdoors with a
[32:18.510 --> 32:21.150]  little bit of that tarp stuff, but that's good.
[32:22.130 --> 32:25.210]  DJ talks about doing that. So if you can figure it out indoors,
[32:25.210 --> 32:28.770]  you can do it outdoors. Just extend your season. Tarp talk again.
[32:28.810 --> 32:30.630]  We'll get to that in another episode. All right.
[32:30.630 --> 32:33.690]  So we know when to put them out. We know when flowering is going to start. Uh,
[32:33.690 --> 32:37.690]  since we're starting flowering mid July, mid August, uh,
[32:37.730 --> 32:42.050]  usually 55 to 65 days from there is going to be our harvest date, right? Yeah.
[32:42.210 --> 32:45.410]  All right. Strain dependent, strain dependent. Um,
[32:45.450 --> 32:50.330]  and you're going to see much more variants in trichome maturity throughout the
[32:50.350 --> 32:53.630]  plant outdoors that you would indoors, uh, indoors.
[32:53.630 --> 32:55.390]  When I look at a plant for ripeness,
[32:55.410 --> 32:58.430]  I use a scope to look at the top of the middle and the bottom of the plant,
[32:58.750 --> 33:01.150]  just scope around a little bit measure with my eye.
[33:01.150 --> 33:04.630]  I don't use it too scientific of a method. I look at the trichomes. Uh,
[33:04.630 --> 33:08.270]  if a few of them are kind of Amber, it's time to cut. If none of them are Amber,
[33:08.350 --> 33:11.510]  leave the plant standing. I see a difference in the top,
[33:11.510 --> 33:15.030]  the middle and the bottom of the plant indoors. When you do it outdoors,
[33:15.270 --> 33:17.790]  the top of the plant, the trichomes will be done.
[33:17.970 --> 33:22.010]  They'll be Brown and the bottom of that plant still be crystal clear trichomes.
[33:22.570 --> 33:24.490]  Uh, it's a little harder to judge when to cut.
[33:25.010 --> 33:29.130]  Maybe you want to do what Jesse says and take part of it and wait a couple days
[33:29.130 --> 33:32.890]  while you're trimming and then take the rest of it. Um, it's up to you how you do
[33:32.890 --> 33:36.730]  it, but don't be too discouraged when you see the difference in the plant.
[33:36.970 --> 33:40.010]  You just got to pick a date and cut or do it however you want to stagger that.
[33:40.250 --> 33:41.930]  For sure. It's going to be a huge difference though.
[33:42.050 --> 33:45.410]  I actually recommend, um, through my years of experience,
[33:45.430 --> 33:47.910]  I've changed my opinion on this, but, um,
[33:47.930 --> 33:52.630]  I actually recommend a slow harvest like that because most of the outdoor I've
[33:52.870 --> 33:57.790]  I've seen in my life here in Southern Colorado gets way too overdried. Um,
[33:57.830 --> 33:59.790]  or it'll develop mold issues,
[33:59.790 --> 34:04.150]  hanging in too small of a room or this or that and easiest way to eliminate all
[34:04.150 --> 34:06.550]  those problems is just harvest in small chunks.
[34:06.890 --> 34:10.830]  Take the top most mature buds off, stand out the plant,
[34:11.030 --> 34:13.670]  let the middle buds harvest off, you know,
[34:13.690 --> 34:16.650]  go ahead and finish off and so on and so forth. Take two weeks to harvest.
[34:16.650 --> 34:17.490]  Who gives a shit?
[34:17.570 --> 34:20.290]  You're going to be trimming all that weed for two weeks anyways, right?
[34:20.450 --> 34:22.850]  And it's going to be overdrive by the time you're done trimming it.
[34:22.970 --> 34:27.010]  So it can catch up and it'll stay moist. It'll stay alive. Yeah. That's killer.
[34:27.210 --> 34:31.570]  That's you can do that indoors. However, plants may Herm indoors doing that.
[34:31.570 --> 34:35.010]  That stresses them a little bit, but you're at the last two weeks. So, I mean,
[34:35.010 --> 34:38.150]  it's kinda, it's up to you what you want to, if you want to risk that or not.
[34:38.530 --> 34:42.010]  Indoors. It seems like the buds don't always mature off.
[34:42.070 --> 34:43.270]  It's like you scared the plant.
[34:43.270 --> 34:45.110]  You pissed it off and it doesn't know what to do. It's like,
[34:45.110 --> 34:46.350]  where'd my top go and it's trying to,
[34:46.350 --> 34:49.270]  it's actually trying to decide which bud is the top.
[34:49.270 --> 34:52.510]  Now it's trying to send hormones to decide which is now the top,
[34:52.510 --> 34:55.710]  the dominant top to be the King. So it's spending too much energy there. Yeah.
[34:55.830 --> 34:59.110]  I've seen outdoor plants. They just, they never even skip a beat. You know,
[34:59.110 --> 35:02.350]  it's like, great. We got sunlight now. The sun is the King. Yeah.
[35:02.470 --> 35:05.950]  The sun's God out there. That's why a lot of cultures worship the sun. All right,
[35:05.950 --> 35:10.270]  let's move on and talk about, uh, there's some things to think about options.
[35:10.290 --> 35:14.170]  Do you want to go from clones or seeds? If you're going from seed,
[35:14.530 --> 35:16.090]  I hope you have sex to your plant.
[35:16.250 --> 35:20.050]  We don't want male plants ending up outdoors pollinating everybody for the next
[35:20.050 --> 35:22.250]  four miles. Cause there are a lot of people growing outdoors.
[35:22.250 --> 35:24.050]  Don't fuck up everybody's grow. Please.
[35:24.210 --> 35:28.050]  You should outdoors. If your plants are decent size and are good health,
[35:28.170 --> 35:33.250]  you should, if you do, like Jeff said, I don't recommend doing it either,
[35:33.290 --> 35:35.730]  but if you do do that, um,
[35:36.030 --> 35:41.030]  you should be able to tell that the plants are males long
[35:41.030 --> 35:45.090]  before they go into flower. So that, that requires like checking it every three
[35:45.090 --> 35:46.550]  days. Be diligent about it.
[35:46.630 --> 35:48.030]  Yeah. Please look every three days.
[35:48.030 --> 35:51.070]  If you see ball sacks instead of little fingers throwing a peace sign,
[35:51.070 --> 35:52.710]  you got boy plants. They need to go.
[35:53.310 --> 35:57.350]  The ideal way to do that is to run those seeds indoors, cut a clone from it,
[35:57.590 --> 36:01.270]  flower the clone and see what's going on. And if it shows that it's a female,
[36:01.270 --> 36:02.870]  keep it. And if it shows it's a male toss it,
[36:02.950 --> 36:04.530]  that's the easiest way to solve that problem.
[36:04.950 --> 36:07.390]  And then you still have the original plant that you can put outdoors.
[36:07.410 --> 36:09.310]  It's growing nice and big. It's nice and bushy.
[36:09.510 --> 36:11.630]  I like to take the top because I'm going to top it anyway.
[36:11.630 --> 36:13.230]  So I just take that main node right off the top,
[36:13.270 --> 36:17.350]  make my first clone that becomes either my mother plant or my throwaway for
[36:17.350 --> 36:19.710]  sure. Love to do it that way. So, um,
[36:19.950 --> 36:21.750]  decide if you want to grow from seeds or clones.
[36:21.870 --> 36:23.590]  Some of you don't have access to clones.
[36:23.590 --> 36:26.590]  So if you don't have access to seeds growth, whatever you can do the best,
[36:26.590 --> 36:29.070]  you can just pay attention. If you don't know where you got,
[36:29.110 --> 36:31.630]  where your source of your clones came from, pay attention.
[36:31.930 --> 36:34.530]  You're going to have to pay attention very closely unless you trust your clone
[36:34.530 --> 36:36.770]  source seeds. Same thing. I'm a breeder.
[36:36.770 --> 36:38.770]  I know that some people will send you shitty seeds.
[36:39.050 --> 36:41.770]  Those some people will send you amazing seeds. Pay attention.
[36:43.090 --> 36:45.410]  You're going to have to have some expectations. Uh,
[36:45.450 --> 36:49.050]  know what you're trying to grow. Know what you've got coming out of those seeds.
[36:49.370 --> 36:52.930]  I know if you've got an Indica or a sativa or a 70 day or a 50 day strain,
[36:52.930 --> 36:57.290]  know if you need a lot of space or an F two or a polyhybrid or,
[36:58.090 --> 37:00.090]  do some research before you order your seeds.
[37:00.110 --> 37:03.190]  We're going to do a whole episode on that too, I think. Um,
[37:03.470 --> 37:06.190]  so another thing you're going to have to think about is do you want to grow your
[37:06.190 --> 37:10.310]  plants in pots with soil above the ground?
[37:10.430 --> 37:13.630]  Or do you want to dig holes in the ground and put your plants directly into the
[37:13.630 --> 37:16.830]  soil? That's something to think about. If you're going to do that,
[37:17.030 --> 37:19.670]  you need to think about your soil or your whole size.
[37:20.070 --> 37:22.510]  Either way you need to think about what kind of soil you're going to use.
[37:22.910 --> 37:25.430]  Do you can use bottled nutrients in outdoor grow?
[37:25.510 --> 37:26.670]  Is that something you want to do?
[37:26.730 --> 37:30.170]  Or do you want to mix up Jesse's secret recipe that he's going to share with us
[37:30.170 --> 37:32.490]  on probably the next episode on mixing soil?
[37:33.090 --> 37:35.970]  Do you want to use a soil recipe to where all you got to do is feed it with
[37:35.970 --> 37:38.930]  water and tea a couple of times. That's something to think about.
[37:38.930 --> 37:42.770]  So do you want to go organic? Do you want to go synthetic?
[37:42.770 --> 37:44.970]  Do you want to go premix? Do you want to go no-till?
[37:45.010 --> 37:47.850]  Do you want to use compost? Those are a lot of things to think about.
[37:47.850 --> 37:50.050]  Mostly that's going to be the amount of work you want to do.
[37:50.250 --> 37:53.370]  The dedication you want to put in and also your budget is a lot of what's going
[37:53.370 --> 37:56.010]  to decide that. Are you a bottle mixer? Are you a science geek?
[37:56.310 --> 37:59.270]  Or are you like Jesse and want to get your fingernails dirty and mix organics?
[37:59.430 --> 38:02.470]  Well, this is my opinion, not Jeff's.
[38:03.150 --> 38:05.070]  But we'll talk about it more in the next show,
[38:05.070 --> 38:07.430]  but there's no reason not to grow organic outdoors.
[38:07.470 --> 38:09.230]  It's actually much, much easier.
[38:09.390 --> 38:12.150]  I agree with that. I'll completely agree with that.
[38:12.990 --> 38:15.910]  Not everybody is going to be on the same page with us though. But I agree.
[38:16.270 --> 38:19.190]  If you're going to do it outdoors, why not go organic? That's my opinion. Yeah.
[38:19.190 --> 38:21.430]  You don't need to be mixing up veg bloom and carrying it outside.
[38:21.710 --> 38:25.950]  Yeah. Pot size always go bigger and smart pots outdoors are way better.
[38:25.970 --> 38:30.010]  And black plastic ones. Yes. Those earth colored, the tan colored smart pots.
[38:30.050 --> 38:32.930]  Yeah. Those things are sweet. Yeah. Use those outside. And Jesse said,
[38:32.970 --> 38:36.450]  said it right. Go big. Uh, if your, if your pot is too big,
[38:36.610 --> 38:40.010]  the only downfall is that you can hold more water so you don't have to water as
[38:40.010 --> 38:40.650]  frequently.
[38:40.650 --> 38:43.810]  That's not a problem outdoors because you're going to be amazed at how much
[38:43.810 --> 38:47.450]  these plants drink when it gets 90 to a hundred degrees out there and the plants
[38:47.450 --> 38:50.290]  need water at six in the morning and at noon and at three,
[38:51.330 --> 38:54.970]  how does a five gallon pot use 15 gallons of water a day?
[38:55.350 --> 38:59.470]  You just answered your question right there. Yep. Pretty much in my opinion.
[38:59.870 --> 39:03.510]  And then at the end of the year when you've got these giant resin covered buds,
[39:03.510 --> 39:05.710]  you're going to go, Holy shit, that's where all my water went.
[39:05.770 --> 39:10.150]  You're going to notice it's going to be way worth it. So big pots. Uh,
[39:10.470 --> 39:15.150]  now some people choose to drag their pots indoors into a structure.
[39:15.190 --> 39:19.270]  If that's something you want to do, you're going to have to set a rigorous schedule.
[39:19.270 --> 39:22.310]  You can't fuck that up once or you're going to cause problems.
[39:22.330 --> 39:25.450]  You also want a good dolly system so that you don't bust the plants up.
[39:26.330 --> 39:29.970]  I've seen that happen a few times. Actually we'll, we'll throw it in,
[39:29.970 --> 39:34.290]  but tools is something we'll tools that you need. Okay. That's I'm going to write,
[39:34.330 --> 39:37.570]  I'm going to make a note of tools. We'll keep going though. Daniel, this there.
[39:37.670 --> 39:41.330]  All right. Well feel free to add stuff. You are the outdoor expert here.
[39:41.330 --> 39:44.810]  That's why we call you in. We, uh, I'm like Rick from pond stars. I know a guy.
[39:45.570 --> 39:49.650]  This is, I think our third episode we've done, um, on outdoors.
[39:49.990 --> 39:53.270]  If you go back through all the Chronicles or as Jeff is, uh,
[39:53.370 --> 39:55.950]  releasing the old episodes, you'll,
[39:55.950 --> 40:00.950]  you'll run into some of the older outdoor episodes and in a lot of ways they're
[40:01.350 --> 40:05.270]  similar, but they also show our experiences changing throughout the years too.
[40:05.630 --> 40:07.470]  As growers and podcasters. Yeah.
[40:07.510 --> 40:10.270]  I can't wait to start putting out the episodes when you start popping in the
[40:10.270 --> 40:14.150]  show in the old because bro, you've come a long way. Yeah. Yeah.
[40:14.310 --> 40:17.870]  I was so nervous. You were dead silent. The first episode you would not,
[40:18.450 --> 40:21.130]  it's a podcast and you're nodding bro, but we'll get you going.
[40:21.490 --> 40:23.970]  And now you can't get you to shut up. So it's fucking awesome. I love it.
[40:24.090 --> 40:29.090]  It's great. You're Mike friendly. Also. It's awesome. Um, pots, big pots. Yeah.
[40:29.130 --> 40:32.570]  If you're going to drag them in, like Jesse said, get a dolly system. Uh,
[40:32.610 --> 40:35.290]  I have been putting everything on wheels at the grow. Yeah.
[40:35.410 --> 40:38.170]  Anything I can put on wheels, it's on wheels. The shop vac came on wheels.
[40:38.190 --> 40:40.610]  I fucking pulled them off and built our own wheels for it. Cause they're better.
[40:40.930 --> 40:44.330]  Like if it can roll, it makes my life way better. I love it.
[40:45.070 --> 40:48.950]  I think the most used tool in my grow lately has been a shop vac. Yeah. Yeah.
[40:49.070 --> 40:53.210]  The pH pen in the shop bag is what we use the most to get big pots. You guys,
[40:53.350 --> 40:57.430]  we will talk about soil, um, whole size, whole size,
[40:57.590 --> 40:58.870]  however much room you've got.
[40:58.910 --> 41:02.810]  If you can dig like a three foot round two foot deep hole and fill it with super
[41:02.810 --> 41:03.950]  high quality soil,
[41:04.070 --> 41:06.630]  that's amended with the proper amendments that we're going to talk about in
[41:06.630 --> 41:09.350]  another episode. Do that. Spend that money. Yeah.
[41:09.850 --> 41:14.650]  Um, a three by three hole that is 18 inches deep is 100 gallons.
[41:15.050 --> 41:17.450]  So, and a 100 gallon, uh,
[41:17.490 --> 41:22.090]  smart pot or hole is very common and it's, it's, um,
[41:22.290 --> 41:26.170]  you'll be very successful. That's, you know, very successful. Yeah.
[41:26.290 --> 41:28.250]  I've seen, uh, people use kiddie pools,
[41:28.370 --> 41:31.130]  like the pools that your kid plays in in the, in the front lawn. Excuse me.
[41:31.130 --> 41:31.970]  I'm going to burp.
[41:32.330 --> 41:35.130]  There you go. You do that. Stab some holes in the bottom of it. Yes.
[41:35.370 --> 41:38.450]  A lot of holes. It needs to drain. You don't want to create a mud hole.
[41:38.470 --> 41:40.150]  You want to, you want to have aeration in there.
[41:40.230 --> 41:43.750]  Take a soldering iron and just fucking go all Christopher walking on it.
[41:46.310 --> 41:49.190]  I've got the coolest image in my head. Hey, I'm fucking stabbing it.
[41:49.230 --> 41:53.470]  I can't do a walk-in impersonation, but it's your dirt when he threatens to step.
[41:53.710 --> 41:56.230]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I just see it happening with a solid iron in a pool.
[41:56.230 --> 42:00.270]  They'll grow your weed asshole. It's fucking hilarious. All right.
[42:00.270 --> 42:04.110]  So think about if you want to do pots or if you want to go directly in the
[42:04.110 --> 42:06.470]  ground, that may not be an option. You may have this,
[42:06.490 --> 42:09.850]  the decision may be made for you. My backyard where I live is all rock.
[42:09.890 --> 42:12.210]  I couldn't go into that ground. I'd have to tell up all the rock.
[42:12.210 --> 42:13.930]  I'd have to dig three feet and replace all the dirt.
[42:14.170 --> 42:17.050]  If you're only going to grow in the place for a year, um,
[42:17.090 --> 42:21.570]  or you don't know for sure you're growing there the next year. Um, pots are,
[42:21.650 --> 42:25.690]  you know, soil is expensive and there's no reason you can't reuse it again the
[42:25.690 --> 42:30.250]  next year. So I recommend pots. Um, if you're,
[42:30.930 --> 42:33.290]  if you're more comfortable and you know,
[42:33.290 --> 42:35.330]  like say you own the house or something like that,
[42:35.630 --> 42:38.670]  then I recommend building up a hole in the ground,
[42:38.690 --> 42:43.070]  but it takes a lot of work and initially you're going to haul off half the soil
[42:43.070 --> 42:47.630]  and that hole and, and import a Pete or cocoa based potting soil.
[42:48.630 --> 42:51.910]  Um, if you're outdoors and commercial, uh,
[42:52.350 --> 42:57.230]  I also recommend pots and get your checkbook out because it's very fucking
[42:57.230 --> 43:01.390]  expensive. Yeah. 9,900 gallon plants. Oh my God. Um,
[43:01.810 --> 43:06.770]  one giant trellis. Yeah. Oh fuck. Um, if you're, you know,
[43:06.770 --> 43:11.330]  kind of a more Norco NorCal style grower, um,
[43:11.530 --> 43:14.570]  and you're doing, you know, 25 plants or something like that, you know,
[43:14.770 --> 43:18.610]  I'd probably go with plants in the ground, but a lot of it,
[43:18.850 --> 43:23.050]  it depends on the quality of soil, um, at your location.
[43:23.170 --> 43:25.570]  I think we'll go over that some more next time.
[43:26.090 --> 43:29.250]  We'll go in depth on dirt. I'm going to just write dirt real big.
[43:29.590 --> 43:30.950]  I've got to, um,
[43:31.030 --> 43:34.950]  I've been learning a lot of new stuff about probiotics and,
[43:35.390 --> 43:38.710]  and working with native soils and soil compositions. Um,
[43:39.110 --> 43:42.110]  I'm hoping next episode I can, uh,
[43:42.150 --> 43:46.390]  put it together in my brain well enough to, to convey it to the listeners.
[43:46.510 --> 43:49.510]  I'm good at fishing parts out and putting them together. So we'll put it,
[43:49.510 --> 43:52.070]  we'll put it on paper and make it happen. All right. So you've,
[43:52.150 --> 43:54.070]  now you've decided if you're running clones or seeds,
[43:54.070 --> 43:56.110]  you've decided if you're going in pots or in the ground,
[43:56.110 --> 43:57.990]  Jesse's going to teach you what kind of soil to use.
[43:58.210 --> 44:01.170]  If you don't want to mix up fancy soil, you can go to the store and buy some crap.
[44:01.490 --> 44:05.090]  We recommend that you mix up some good stuff. Now you need to need to decide,
[44:05.130 --> 44:07.170]  are you going to grow in a greenhouse?
[44:07.290 --> 44:09.490]  Are you going to go to Lowe's and buy a little crappy greenhouse?
[44:09.490 --> 44:13.450]  Are you going to call forever flowering and get the fucking convertible custom
[44:13.470 --> 44:16.290]  Corvette greenhouse? Or are you going to go light depth?
[44:16.330 --> 44:18.530]  We're going to talk about a whole nother episode about light depth and hoop
[44:18.530 --> 44:21.330]  houses. You guys light depth or hoop house is also another option.
[44:21.330 --> 44:25.010]  Or do you just want to go butt naked and go outdoors and just grow outdoors under
[44:25.010 --> 44:26.730]  the sun under the stars with no cover?
[44:26.990 --> 44:28.390]  That's something you need to think about.
[44:28.590 --> 44:33.190]  So in that equation, the more money you spend, the higher quality of bud,
[44:33.190 --> 44:37.350]  you will have a plants that are just outdoors, get really beat up by the rain,
[44:37.350 --> 44:40.430]  the wind, the sun, even to a point.
[44:41.030 --> 44:43.350]  But that doesn't really happen late till later in the season.
[44:43.750 --> 44:47.030]  But you get frostier bud, the more you cover your plants.
[44:47.110 --> 44:50.870]  Absolutely. So I like the way you put it in the very beginning of that,
[44:50.870 --> 44:53.510]  the more you spend, the better it will come out in the end. For sure.
[44:53.590 --> 44:55.190]  If you spend wisely, you can't just throw,
[44:55.490 --> 44:57.690]  you can't just make it rain and expect the plants to come out better.
[44:58.050 --> 45:02.290]  But if you spend some decent money on a decent greenhouse that has ventilation
[45:02.290 --> 45:05.730]  and protects it from the wind, the hail, maybe even some of the bugs,
[45:05.930 --> 45:07.290]  it will really help you out.
[45:07.450 --> 45:10.650]  A little bit of cover goes a long way when it comes to growing cannabis.
[45:10.810 --> 45:14.490]  Even when you know it's going to rain,
[45:14.570 --> 45:17.050]  you don't even need to cover the plants.
[45:17.050 --> 45:19.890]  Just a well placed piece of plastic. If you,
[45:20.130 --> 45:24.450]  if you realize where the rain's coming from in your patch,
[45:24.450 --> 45:28.630]  always figure out where the prevailing wind comes from. Like here, um,
[45:28.670 --> 45:31.110]  say at my work, the wind always comes out of the West.
[45:31.430 --> 45:36.230]  So our outdoor plants will be protected from the dust that comes from the West
[45:36.670 --> 45:38.430]  with a simple piece of plastic.
[45:38.470 --> 45:41.270]  And I guarantee it'll make a noticeable difference. Right.
[45:41.510 --> 45:45.550]  So think about stuff like that. Perfect. Planning. Yeah.
[45:45.570 --> 45:48.470]  It's planning, planning, planning. That's what this whole episode's about.
[45:48.510 --> 45:51.150]  Yeah. Plan ahead. You guys that way. That way when does come up,
[45:51.170 --> 45:52.770]  you're not out there scrambling. Yeah.
[45:54.650 --> 45:58.330]  Where was I cover the plants, something above them. Oh,
[45:58.330 --> 46:01.450]  I was going to say a long time ago when I first got,
[46:01.450 --> 46:04.210]  I've got a dino light scope that hooks up to my computer and you can see
[46:04.230 --> 46:06.370]  trichomes. They're the whole size of my computer screen.
[46:06.370 --> 46:09.250]  Like one trichome is whatever this Mac books, like a 13 inch screen.
[46:09.250 --> 46:11.310]  So then the trichome head was a 13 inch circle.
[46:11.970 --> 46:15.090]  We were putting buds under it and we had indoor and outdoor buds and the indoor
[46:15.110 --> 46:17.430]  buds had these big, beautiful bulbous trichomes.
[46:17.770 --> 46:20.090]  And a lot of the outdoors were similar. And then we got to one batch.
[46:20.110 --> 46:22.670]  And I was like, what the fuck's up with these trichomes? They look beat to shit.
[46:22.990 --> 46:25.310]  It was because they got beat up by rain. I'm certain of it.
[46:25.310 --> 46:27.750]  They were outdoors in the rain, just pummel those trichomes.
[46:28.010 --> 46:30.430]  It took all the bulbous heads right off of them.
[46:30.430 --> 46:33.510]  It was just stocks on a lot of the trichomes on the very tops of the plants.
[46:33.870 --> 46:36.430]  So yeah, protect your plants. It'll keep those trichomes on there.
[46:36.430 --> 46:38.950]  And that's what you're, that's what you're farming for. You're a trichome farmer.
[46:39.190 --> 46:42.110]  Yeah. That's your goal. Terps and trichomes. Yeah. Yeah.
[46:42.190 --> 46:46.190]  That's pretty much the green part. We don't need that. It's just the carrier.
[46:46.350 --> 46:49.270]  That's just the earth suit for all of what we need. All right.
[46:49.270 --> 46:52.570]  So, oh, hell yes.
[46:52.610 --> 46:56.770]  Hell happens pretty much everywhere. Especially in the Midwest.
[46:57.730 --> 47:02.010]  And it's pretty predictable about what times of the year it's going to happen at.
[47:03.730 --> 47:08.170]  You don't have to cover the plants completely and actually throwing up plastic
[47:08.330 --> 47:11.410]  over plants during a hell storm can actually damage it worse.
[47:13.290 --> 47:18.250]  Series of chicken wire and stuff like chicken
[47:18.270 --> 47:21.190]  wire. Fuck, what's it just like screen.
[47:22.630 --> 47:25.930]  I was trying to think of a specific kind of like screen.
[47:27.310 --> 47:30.070]  But all that kind of stuff, it can help break up the hell.
[47:31.470 --> 47:35.310]  It'll bounce off of it. It's a lot easier to put up.
[47:35.510 --> 47:36.350]  So, I mean,
[47:36.510 --> 47:39.830]  so just maybe like a ceiling or a roof of just chicken wire.
[47:39.910 --> 47:40.830]  So then when it's coming down,
[47:40.830 --> 47:43.070]  it just breaks and you still get plenty of sun penetration.
[47:43.070 --> 47:47.470]  I recommend like at least two layers and overlap them on each other so that it
[47:47.930 --> 47:49.290]  makes the holes even smaller.
[47:50.170 --> 47:53.770]  Okay. Or real fine, real, even extra fine chicken wire.
[47:53.770 --> 47:55.890]  I don't know what that would be called, but yeah. Monkey wire.
[47:58.210 --> 47:59.050]  You need to find her mesh.
[47:59.250 --> 48:02.770]  Like a quarter inch screen. I can't think of the term I normally call it.
[48:03.170 --> 48:06.010]  Something with small, fine holes so that when that hail comes, it shatters it.
[48:06.010 --> 48:08.050]  That's a brilliant idea. I would have never thought of it that way.
[48:09.210 --> 48:10.810]  And when it does rain on your buds,
[48:11.130 --> 48:15.070]  the natural instinct is to want to go out there and shake them dry or blow them
[48:15.070 --> 48:17.290]  dry. And you're actually, when you're doing that,
[48:17.290 --> 48:19.390]  you're actually pushing water into the bud.
[48:19.790 --> 48:22.990]  If you leave it to its own devices, it'll drain it away from the outside.
[48:23.190 --> 48:24.990]  Right. That's something that I've never mentioned,
[48:24.990 --> 48:27.110]  but it was a theory that I've had. First off,
[48:27.130 --> 48:29.910]  trichomes work is like a like Rain-X, you know,
[48:29.910 --> 48:31.030]  when you put Rain-X under windshield,
[48:31.870 --> 48:33.230]  trichomes work just like that.
[48:33.670 --> 48:36.490]  And I think that the way the cannabis plant shapes itself,
[48:36.910 --> 48:40.990]  it works as an umbrella and it pushes the water out to where the outer roots are.
[48:40.990 --> 48:43.810]  Actually, I think the plant represents the underground.
[48:43.810 --> 48:46.550]  It's like I'm shaped this way up top, I'm shaped this way on the bottom.
[48:46.810 --> 48:48.810]  So it umbrellas the water, it spreads it out.
[48:48.810 --> 48:51.830]  The leaves go outward and the water runs outwards as it falls down and it lands
[48:51.830 --> 48:54.490]  at the base on an outward circle where it wants it.
[48:54.810 --> 48:56.850]  And when it, yeah, I totally agree with that.
[48:58.170 --> 49:02.250]  And when it rains on a plant, it drops its leaves. You know,
[49:02.250 --> 49:05.130]  you might get scared, you know, freak out.
[49:06.210 --> 49:08.890]  That's its own natural defense.
[49:08.890 --> 49:11.930]  It's covering the bud and it's helping drain it away from the plant.
[49:12.050 --> 49:14.730]  Yeah. The plant's got little, little hairs,
[49:14.790 --> 49:18.150]  little cuticle hairs all over the leaves that they move the water.
[49:18.150 --> 49:20.070]  You can't see it happening, but they're like little fingers,
[49:20.070 --> 49:21.510]  just brushing the water the right direction.
[49:21.510 --> 49:24.710]  They encourage it to flow the right way. So the plant is protecting itself.
[49:25.510 --> 49:28.070]  All right. So greenhouse, we talked about that.
[49:28.750 --> 49:31.710]  You want to talk about projected problems and ways to kind of get ahead of them
[49:31.730 --> 49:33.950]  before we get to them? I just burped right into the mic.
[49:33.950 --> 49:37.230]  I tried to prevent it so bad. Excuse me, everybody. I'm a rude ass podcaster.
[49:37.510 --> 49:39.790]  I tried so hard to avoid that. So let's talk about some problems that may come
[49:39.790 --> 49:40.630]  up.
[49:40.810 --> 49:43.490]  The first one you'll probably see is, well,
[49:43.650 --> 49:46.210]  some people see aphids pretty quick or thrips.
[49:47.890 --> 49:51.170]  They, they still tend to come out pretty late in the season.
[49:53.490 --> 49:55.690]  And grasshoppers too, this also applies for.
[49:57.770 --> 50:02.290]  The way to get rid of them the best you can is preventative. Get away.
[50:03.130 --> 50:04.210]  Jesus, I'm all stoned.
[50:04.690 --> 50:07.250]  My fault, my fault. Jenny Beth's fault.
[50:07.330 --> 50:08.690]  Starting to lose my voice too.
[50:10.650 --> 50:14.970]  Get all the vegetation away from them. Especially like sunflowers and
[50:16.690 --> 50:21.250]  sunflowers, tumbleweeds, all that kind of shit. Grasshoppers love that.
[50:21.810 --> 50:25.690]  So if you get all the food away from their plant, from, you know, the plants.
[50:25.850 --> 50:27.330]  Inviting things, remove that.
[50:27.810 --> 50:30.490]  Last year you told me chickens to defend against grasshoppers.
[50:30.490 --> 50:32.170]  For sure. Once the plants are.
[50:32.210 --> 50:33.170]  Once they're big enough to be.
[50:33.170 --> 50:34.250]  Once they're bigger than the chickens.
[50:34.250 --> 50:38.410]  Above pecking range. All right. So I didn't even think,
[50:38.430 --> 50:41.870]  I was going to talk about bugs. So I'm glad you said thrips and aphids.
[50:41.870 --> 50:43.470]  Aphids you guys are really easy to find.
[50:43.470 --> 50:45.030]  I've talked about them in another episode.
[50:45.430 --> 50:47.710]  Let's not spray a bunch of shit outside. You guys,
[50:48.150 --> 50:50.750]  let's not put pesticides on the outdoors. That's my outdoors.
[50:50.750 --> 50:53.990]  It's Jesse's outdoors. It's my daughter's outdoors. It's everybody's outside.
[50:53.990 --> 50:56.110]  Let's not spray too much shit to disrupt outside.
[50:56.390 --> 51:01.230]  If you want to buy some stuff to use to combat the bugs outside by
[51:01.270 --> 51:04.210]  predatory insects and release them on your garden outdoors,
[51:04.430 --> 51:05.630]  that's the best thing you can do.
[51:05.650 --> 51:10.010]  It's not going to disrupt the ecosystem or be patient and wait for nature to
[51:10.010 --> 51:13.370]  work its course. Because if you get aphids, whatever eats aphids is coming next.
[51:13.410 --> 51:15.770]  It's going to be like aphids and it's going to come have a fucking orgy on your
[51:15.770 --> 51:16.770]  aphids. It's going to eat them up.
[51:16.850 --> 51:19.650]  There is an email service that you can sign up for.
[51:19.650 --> 51:23.410]  I will have the link for the next show. Um,
[51:23.490 --> 51:28.090]  you plug in your, your region. Um, and that's it.
[51:28.090 --> 51:31.650]  That's all the information you have to go. And they send you free emails to let
[51:31.650 --> 51:35.330]  you know, Hey, it's almost aphid season. Wow. Or Hey,
[51:35.330 --> 51:38.070]  it's almost spider mite season. So it's,
[51:38.070 --> 51:42.470]  it's just a tool that all farmer choose. I just learned about it.
[51:42.470 --> 51:45.950]  I was like, so we're going to bring a dope growers in on this too.
[51:46.470 --> 51:46.550]  Well,
[51:46.550 --> 51:49.990]  I think it's really neat that the department of agriculture in Colorado has
[51:49.990 --> 51:52.250]  stepped up and said, Hey, you're growing cannabis.
[51:52.250 --> 51:54.350]  You were a part of the department of agriculture.
[51:54.350 --> 51:57.190]  There's an agricultural product before they denied us.
[51:57.190 --> 51:59.950]  They didn't want anything to do with us. Now they're actually helping us out.
[51:59.950 --> 52:02.870]  They're stepping in and saying, these are things you can do, things you can use,
[52:03.170 --> 52:05.730]  ways you can solve problems. So we're going to learn a lot more stuff.
[52:05.730 --> 52:08.650]  I'm sure somebody in the department of ag shared that with one of our dope
[52:08.650 --> 52:09.490]  growing friends.
[52:09.890 --> 52:11.650]  No, actually. Uh, um,
[52:12.330 --> 52:16.610]  I've been doing some webinars and I learned about it from that. So, um,
[52:16.890 --> 52:19.410]  I love how hungry for info you are. Oh yeah. Yeah.
[52:19.410 --> 52:23.290]  You stay busy and you stay learning. It's awesome. I love that. Um, fuck,
[52:23.290 --> 52:24.330]  what else was I going to say?
[52:24.490 --> 52:26.770]  We're talking about bugs, but I've got a list here. If you got lost,
[52:26.770 --> 52:27.610]  I can jump in whenever you need.
[52:27.890 --> 52:32.250]  Grasshoppers there's a product called no low bait and it's biological. Um,
[52:32.670 --> 52:37.710]  it will not harm the earth. Uh, and you throw it out here in Southern Colorado,
[52:37.710 --> 52:42.630]  you throw it out in about a month and it's just a microbe that eats the
[52:42.630 --> 52:46.790]  grasshopper. We'll eat the bait. Cause it's when grasshoppers first emerged,
[52:46.790 --> 52:49.310]  there isn't a whole lot of food. So the theory is,
[52:49.310 --> 52:53.950]  is they're going to go after this bait and it's like granulated. Um, you know,
[52:54.030 --> 52:57.350]  just grasshopper bait. Um, they eat it.
[52:57.550 --> 53:01.910]  It's actually a biological fungus and it stops them from being ill.
[53:02.310 --> 53:06.310]  Eat anything and they grow mold from the inside out and they die.
[53:06.630 --> 53:09.430]  Excellent. So beneficial fungus are amazing, aren't they?
[53:09.590 --> 53:11.430]  We, uh, yeah. How did my work?
[53:11.430 --> 53:13.910]  They had problems with grasshoppers big time last year.
[53:14.710 --> 53:17.830]  They spent a lot of money on a consultant to tell them that.
[53:17.850 --> 53:19.390]  So there's some free info for you guys.
[53:19.870 --> 53:21.470]  Don't don't waste money on that consultation.
[53:21.470 --> 53:26.110]  No low bait, no low bait. Yeah. And it's a, it's not available anywhere,
[53:26.110 --> 53:30.710]  but the public can buy it. And if you type it in, you'll find it. So just Google it.
[53:31.010 --> 53:32.210]  Get yourself some Nolo bait.
[53:32.610 --> 53:35.050]  Yeah. We're going to throw down like 200 fucking pounds.
[53:36.330 --> 53:39.730]  Sprinkling it out there all day. Like an old guy. I love it. Um,
[53:39.770 --> 53:43.410]  one thing that when I talked about possible problems, cops,
[53:44.490 --> 53:48.650]  if you're growing dope, be prepared for police. If you're a nervous person,
[53:48.650 --> 53:51.930]  if you get anxious around law enforcement, learn to calm the fuck down.
[53:52.290 --> 53:56.730]  How you act around cops is like a good 70% of how they treat you.
[53:57.530 --> 54:00.290]  And unless if they come in and there's a fight, they're treating everybody,
[54:00.350 --> 54:01.030]  how are they are?
[54:01.030 --> 54:04.750]  But if you answer the door that two seconds from when you open the door,
[54:04.750 --> 54:07.310]  if you go, what the fuck it's going bad.
[54:07.310 --> 54:10.070]  If you open the door with a smile and you go, good evening officer,
[54:10.070 --> 54:12.070]  is there a problem? You might be okay.
[54:12.150 --> 54:15.470]  You may have committed the same crime as the guy that opened the door going,
[54:15.470 --> 54:18.710]  what the fuck? And you're good evening officer. How can I help you tonight?
[54:18.710 --> 54:22.590]  I'm super cordial and I have a smile on my face that could make your night go
[54:22.590 --> 54:23.270]  completely different.
[54:23.270 --> 54:26.390]  You could end up on your couch taking a dab or you could end up in the pen,
[54:26.630 --> 54:28.390]  bugging with handcuffs on. It's all about you.
[54:28.570 --> 54:31.970]  I've had a cop in my patch and I had a pistol on my side.
[54:32.850 --> 54:35.890]  It was all about the way I presented myself to the police officer.
[54:37.130 --> 54:39.690]  And you're here now, so I'm sure it went well. Yeah, no problem.
[54:40.050 --> 54:44.090]  He actually complimented the gun. Nice. Yeah. Cool cops. Yeah.
[54:44.130 --> 54:49.050]  Some of them are cool. Um, also you guys, if the cops are showing up,
[54:49.090 --> 54:50.610]  make sure you're not doing something stupid.
[54:51.170 --> 54:53.730]  Don't have a reason for them to come there. Know your rights.
[54:53.850 --> 54:57.330]  When they knock on the door, if you're doing something wrong in the house,
[54:57.750 --> 55:01.790]  step outside, lock the door behind you, lock yourself out of the house.
[55:01.830 --> 55:04.390]  You're locked out. That's okay. Somebody is going to fucking help you get in.
[55:04.590 --> 55:06.790]  Now those cops can't get in there. Even if they're like, let's go in.
[55:06.790 --> 55:08.710]  You're like, I'm locked out. You can't,
[55:08.710 --> 55:12.030]  they can't go search your house if you want it to even better yet. Walk around,
[55:12.070 --> 55:15.510]  lock yourself out and walk around to the back door. And you know,
[55:15.510 --> 55:18.870]  I mean don't surprise them when you walk around, but that even, you know,
[55:18.870 --> 55:23.270]  cause then they can't even look in. So there you go. So, so don't let them in.
[55:23.470 --> 55:26.310]  No, you cannot come in. Do you have a warrant? No warrant.
[55:26.530 --> 55:28.210]  You cannot come in. Is there a problem?
[55:28.570 --> 55:31.370]  If they don't have a problem and don't have probable cause they're not coming
[55:31.370 --> 55:34.090]  in. Don't let them in. They can't talk you into coming in.
[55:34.090 --> 55:36.330]  If you don't want them to come in, tell them no.
[55:36.410 --> 55:38.970]  If they come in without your consent and no warrant,
[55:39.250 --> 55:42.690]  hopefully everything that happens gets dismissed because they fucked up and did
[55:42.690 --> 55:44.730]  it wrong. They need to go get a warrant signed by a judge.
[55:44.770 --> 55:47.050]  They need probable cause they need to come back and do it right.
[55:47.370 --> 55:48.330]  The minute they leave,
[55:48.810 --> 55:51.170]  call two of your best friends and get the fuck rid of everything.
[55:51.330 --> 55:54.930]  Cause they're coming back. Just go get rid of everything. Get that shit gone.
[55:54.930 --> 55:57.550]  Clean up. No evidence. You need to get rid of every stick.
[55:57.550 --> 56:00.310]  You need to get rid of your scissors. Uh, just get rid of it all.
[56:00.310 --> 56:02.910]  Even take your head stash over there, wherever you're taking your shit,
[56:02.910 --> 56:04.750]  just get rid of it for a minute. Cause they're coming back.
[56:04.990 --> 56:07.710]  I recently read the cornbread mafia.
[56:07.830 --> 56:11.230]  That's a book about some dope growers in Kentucky. Um,
[56:11.390 --> 56:13.150]  from back in the eighties and nineties,
[56:13.710 --> 56:17.110]  they when Kentucky first started using airplanes to site grows,
[56:17.350 --> 56:19.750]  they had an airplane fly over the grow.
[56:20.230 --> 56:24.230]  And there were guys working in this one or two acre grow that was full of pot
[56:24.250 --> 56:27.530]  plants. By the time the air, the airplane turned around,
[56:27.530 --> 56:28.850]  went to the airport, landed,
[56:28.850 --> 56:31.730]  got the cops in the cars and started driving to where they were at.
[56:32.090 --> 56:34.450]  When they got there, the entire fucking field was harvested.
[56:34.650 --> 56:37.490]  You need to be that quick. That's what you need to do. You guys.
[56:37.650 --> 56:39.770]  I think of how long it takes us to harvest at work.
[56:40.210 --> 56:43.650]  And I'm like, these guys did that shit. Fuck it. Like seriously,
[56:43.650 --> 56:47.690]  like 30, 45 minutes. Wow. Yeah. They were prepared, bro.
[56:47.690 --> 56:50.330]  Then for sure you haul trucks on site. They were going.
[56:50.510 --> 56:53.110]  And that's a great read by the way. Uh,
[56:53.110 --> 56:56.390]  I highly recommend it if to any readers out there,
[56:56.430 --> 56:59.550]  cornbread cowboys, cornbread, mafia, cornbread mafia.
[56:59.670 --> 57:02.710]  I mix cocaine, cowboys and cornbread mafia together. Yeah.
[57:03.910 --> 57:07.790]  The D is doing with that stupid name. Read it. You guys read that one.
[57:07.790 --> 57:09.870]  It sounds like a good read. If Jesse, right. Right. And check the,
[57:09.950 --> 57:13.310]  Jesse only recommends good books. So read that shit. Um,
[57:13.510 --> 57:16.390]  know what you're going to say. If the police come know your rights,
[57:16.790 --> 57:19.510]  don't be an asshole. Have a, have an idea of practice. Uh,
[57:19.570 --> 57:20.810]  if you're not a good public speaker,
[57:20.810 --> 57:23.930]  seriously look in the mirror and get rid of your damn intimidation of police
[57:23.930 --> 57:26.010]  officers. They're just assholes with, they're not all.
[57:26.010 --> 57:27.690]  There are people with badges with a job to do.
[57:27.890 --> 57:30.010]  A lot of them don't want to bust your weed weed farm.
[57:30.010 --> 57:32.530]  They're just been told to by somebody else. They have to go do it. It's their job.
[57:32.890 --> 57:36.530]  So keep that in mind. Try to be cordial practice. Know your rights.
[57:36.530 --> 57:40.510]  You can't come in here. No, I don't have any marijuana. Come back with a warrant.
[57:40.770 --> 57:42.490]  Just practice the same shit in a car.
[57:42.650 --> 57:47.010]  I've never heard this, um, or I've never been in this situation,
[57:47.010 --> 57:51.110]  but I've heard if you're in the point where you know, you're fucked, uh,
[57:51.150 --> 57:54.110]  offer to start chopping them down for him. Oh yeah. Yeah.
[57:54.150 --> 57:57.110]  If they're in your grow and they're like, you're going to jail for 50 plants,
[57:57.130 --> 58:00.150]  just get scissors. But if I just cut them down right now, sir, you can watch,
[58:00.430 --> 58:03.790]  you can watch me cut them all down. It'll help you when you go to court. Yeah.
[58:04.710 --> 58:09.230]  Hopefully. Yeah. That's what the theory is. Hopefully. Yes. Um,
[58:09.270 --> 58:13.030]  another thing you need to worry about you guys is thieves. Uh, don't advertise,
[58:13.030 --> 58:15.270]  don't brag. Don't tell everybody you're growing.
[58:15.290 --> 58:17.930]  Don't tell anybody you're growing. I've had,
[58:18.450 --> 58:22.930]  I had to grow with some friends and one guy got mad at another guy.
[58:22.930 --> 58:26.210]  And the next morning the whole crop was gone. And the one guy wasn't involved,
[58:26.210 --> 58:29.690]  but I know that he told that the, that the two best friends talked and our whole
[58:29.690 --> 58:32.010]  crop four or five people's operation is gone.
[58:32.010 --> 58:35.690]  Cause one guy told one guy that shouldn't have known he took fucking everything.
[58:35.710 --> 58:37.810]  75 outdoor plants that were taller than me,
[58:38.090 --> 58:40.170]  all gone the day before we went to harvest them.
[58:40.170 --> 58:44.290]  We drove up to harvest to a bunch of sticks. Oh yeah. So don't,
[58:44.290 --> 58:47.870]  don't tell people, uh, don't tell your girlfriend. Don't tell your cousin.
[58:47.890 --> 58:51.310]  Don't tell your best friend. Don't tell your bandmates. Don't tell your masseuse.
[58:51.630 --> 58:54.630]  Don't just shut up. Nobody needs to know about your grow. It's cool.
[58:54.670 --> 58:57.750]  I know we're all happy to take pictures of it, but if just be careful,
[58:58.110 --> 59:00.790]  people are going to go steal shit. People are rippers. Be careful.
[59:00.790 --> 59:04.230]  Keep it far from the fences. Don't have it out where people can reach it.
[59:04.350 --> 59:07.110]  My buddy had a big outdoor grow with a lot of plants and they started taking the
[59:07.130 --> 59:07.950]  corners.
[59:08.350 --> 59:10.830]  They just took the ones in the Northwest corner and then the other corner and
[59:10.850 --> 59:13.830]  they just got every corner where they can just barely get in and get out,
[59:13.890 --> 59:15.810]  get in and get out. Then they started picking them inward.
[59:15.810 --> 59:18.290]  By the time they got like six plants, we all just stayed up all night,
[59:18.330 --> 59:22.770]  cut everything down. Yeah. So thieves don't set up booby traps.
[59:23.050 --> 59:25.370]  This is my advice. Do not set up booby traps.
[59:25.370 --> 59:28.370]  If somebody gets hurt by a booby trap you set up for your cannabis plants,
[59:28.370 --> 59:29.650]  you are going to get in trouble.
[59:29.770 --> 59:34.170]  It's an actual charge and it's called man trapping and it is very easily can
[59:34.190 --> 59:35.050]  become a felony.
[59:35.770 --> 59:38.290]  You hear that guys you're trying to grow medicine and you just accidentally
[59:38.310 --> 59:41.330]  committed a felony by trying to fuck somebody. Let them steal your pot.
[59:41.510 --> 59:44.910]  Just let them take it. They're going to take some shit. Don't shoot them.
[59:44.950 --> 59:48.910]  Don't kill them. Some. Well, if you let your dog out on them,
[59:48.910 --> 59:50.470]  the dog's going to get put down if it bites them.
[59:50.630 --> 59:52.870]  So just really think about how you're going to defend that stuff.
[59:53.470 --> 59:55.030]  The best bet is to secure it,
[59:55.030 --> 59:57.830]  have it in a locked area and don't tell anybody about it. Keep it.
[59:58.230 --> 01:00:00.670]  Girl out in the County, far, far out in the country, far,
[01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:02.030]  far away from everybody. Don't tell anyone.
[01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:05.190]  Many, many of these problems go away or greatly,
[01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:09.150]  greatly reduce the further and further you get away from metropolitan areas.
[01:00:09.250 --> 01:00:13.490]  Yeah, completely. So if you can go far away, do it and don't tell anybody.
[01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:17.530]  And then if somebody tries to steal it, grow more next year, you guys put out
[01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:18.370]  like six plants,
[01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:23.090]  put out plants in different patches is a good way to protect from thieves and
[01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:26.890]  cops. Yeah. Put out six. You got one for the bugs, one for the animals,
[01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:30.330]  one for the thieves, one for the cops, and then hopefully two for you. Yeah.
[01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:34.610]  And then do another patch a few miles away. It's the same thing. Same thing.
[01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:38.410]  Yep. So be careful of cops and thieves. You guys keep your mouth shut.
[01:00:38.410 --> 01:00:39.630]  If you're not in a legal state,
[01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:41.870]  don't post pictures of yourself on the internet with your weed.
[01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:44.830]  Wait until it's harvested, packed up, sold,
[01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:47.430]  then post a picture of yourself with it. Cause now it's already gone.
[01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:50.390]  They've been showing like, well, it's weed. We like what weed that was.
[01:00:50.430 --> 01:00:53.190]  That's gone. All right. So we talked a little bit about bugs.
[01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:54.830]  Let's talk briefly.
[01:00:54.830 --> 01:00:57.710]  Cause I see you were at an hour and I saw you look at your phone and it's 10 30.
[01:00:57.710 --> 01:00:59.630]  So I know we got to wrap this up pretty quick for everybody.
[01:01:00.310 --> 01:01:01.750]  We're right at an hour anyway, so it's perfect.
[01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:04.510]  Let's talk about animals that we may run into. Um,
[01:01:04.770 --> 01:01:08.010]  deer seem to love cannabis. Rabbits seem to love cannabis.
[01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:12.970]  Cats fucking love cannabis plants for sure. Um, cats. Okay.
[01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:14.610]  We'll just start at the end there. Uh,
[01:01:14.650 --> 01:01:19.610]  cats will be one of your least concerns in their early concern early in the
[01:01:19.610 --> 01:01:24.610]  season. Uh, they do like to use your awesome potting soil as a litter box.
[01:01:24.850 --> 01:01:29.930]  That's also a concern. Um, so early in the season,
[01:01:29.970 --> 01:01:33.170]  you know, they can be kind of a pain in the ass.
[01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:35.390]  I've had a cat kill several clones.
[01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:39.390]  I had to replant three times one time at this one place. Um,
[01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:43.030]  so, I mean, I can't really get too pissed at the cat.
[01:01:44.790 --> 01:01:48.950]  I like the plant just as much too. Um, but, uh,
[01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:52.950]  the litter box, you can mulch with plastic, um,
[01:01:53.070 --> 01:01:55.230]  and just cover your, your soil area.
[01:01:55.310 --> 01:01:58.350]  And that will stop them from, uh,
[01:01:58.390 --> 01:02:02.710]  trying to use your soils and litter box that also help with your watering and
[01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:06.010]  building beneficial bacteria and fun guys below it.
[01:02:06.610 --> 01:02:09.770]  Sweet. Okay. We'll trap some heat in there. Yeah. All right.
[01:02:09.890 --> 01:02:13.750]  Chicken wire cages will protect them when they're small from cats and deers.
[01:02:14.370 --> 01:02:17.530]  Um, deer, um, another cool,
[01:02:17.850 --> 01:02:20.490]  or let's go back to deer some more. Um,
[01:02:23.090 --> 01:02:27.210]  a cool trick I've recently learned is you could run a simple two wire hot wire
[01:02:27.490 --> 01:02:32.490]  around your patch and then you bait it by wrapping aluminum foil
[01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:35.510]  around the wire and smear peanut butter on the wire.
[01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:38.830]  The deer will smell the peanut butter. They walk up and lick it.
[01:02:38.970 --> 01:02:43.890]  And if anyone knows what hot wire does, um, the deer won't come back.
[01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:47.070]  I promise it's totally legal.
[01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:51.030]  It's not going to hurt the deer. It's just enough to piss it off and let it know.
[01:02:51.070 --> 01:02:51.750]  Don't come here.
[01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:52.950]  And you can get a small,
[01:02:53.030 --> 01:02:56.870]  you can get a hot wire system for a couple of hundred bucks for a small,
[01:02:57.070 --> 01:03:00.350]  small little pot grow. So, and it's, it's almost guaranteed.
[01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:02.330]  And it's going to slow down a thief also.
[01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:04.490]  When you hear someone in the backyard go, ah, fuck. Yeah.
[01:03:04.570 --> 01:03:08.610]  They just hit the hot wire. All right. That works really well. Um,
[01:03:08.650 --> 01:03:12.330]  what was the middle one? You said rabbits, rabbits, uh, chicken wire cages.
[01:03:12.770 --> 01:03:16.170]  They're only going to be a concern when the plants are really small. Right. Um,
[01:03:16.290 --> 01:03:20.090]  and their poop would be actually beneficial. Okay. Um,
[01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:23.130]  do you think mice are going to get to the cannabis plants if you got mice in the
[01:03:23.130 --> 01:03:26.650]  field or whatever? I've heard about it. I've never personally had problems with it.
[01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:31.390]  Okay. Um, if it was an issue, I would recommend a 22 and a little scope,
[01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:33.990]  but that's just hopefully the cat that we had probably, yeah.
[01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:39.310]  Or a snake would solve your problem. Um, another issue would be gophers, uh,
[01:03:39.350 --> 01:03:44.030]  eating the roots. Um, I've never seen prairie dogs do it, but,
[01:03:44.550 --> 01:03:49.550]  gophers. Um, so the way you fix that is if you're planning in the ground,
[01:03:50.270 --> 01:03:53.950]  uh, put chicken wire around the perimeter of your hole. Um,
[01:03:53.970 --> 01:03:57.770]  if you're planning in a smart pot, put chicken wire around the, the underneath
[01:03:57.770 --> 01:04:00.450]  it. Yeah. Set the plant on chicken wire essentially. Okay.
[01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:04.690]  They won't chew through the wire. So that's pretty smart. And if, if you have,
[01:04:05.090 --> 01:04:07.570]  if that doesn't stop them, just use a heavier gauge of wire,
[01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:10.090]  go up to like some concrete mesh or something like that.
[01:04:10.370 --> 01:04:14.690]  And then if once again, the 22 will work on a gopher also. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
[01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:16.890]  Simple traps will work on gophers too.
[01:04:17.050 --> 01:04:21.210]  So what else might we need to worry about throughout the season? Um, elk,
[01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:24.470]  they'd be the same as deer, uh, depending on your location.
[01:04:25.310 --> 01:04:27.470]  Some people right now are going, what the fuck elk? Yeah.
[01:04:27.470 --> 01:04:29.830]  We live in Colorado. You guys there are elk.
[01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:32.190]  I've heard of bears getting in patches,
[01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:35.710]  but they were going after the stuff in the soil, the blood mill and bone mill.
[01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:37.990]  Oh yeah. Um, if you're growing in bear country,
[01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:40.950]  keep that in mind cause I should, that's bear bait. So,
[01:04:41.350 --> 01:04:42.830]  and they don't give a fuck about,
[01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:45.190]  I was going to say there's nothing you can do to really stop a bear.
[01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:47.190]  Fucking lock the door,
[01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:51.330]  get in the truck and drive. Um, snakes,
[01:04:51.330 --> 01:04:52.890]  I don't believe would be an issue.
[01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:57.650]  They would only be a harm to the farmer himself. Right. Um,
[01:04:57.850 --> 01:05:00.690]  and only a small percentage of those are actually going to be a harm to you.
[01:05:02.890 --> 01:05:04.690]  Um, shit. I can't take it. Any other pests.
[01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:09.010]  Sounds like we've got some stuff for more episodes. Yeah. All right. Cool. Um,
[01:05:09.090 --> 01:05:12.530]  we'll get tools next time. Cause I do need to go get some dinner. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:05:12.530 --> 01:05:14.170]  Well I've got a couple of things to handle also. So man,
[01:05:14.170 --> 01:05:16.690]  thank you for coming and doing a long podcast with me. We did over an hour.
[01:05:16.690 --> 01:05:17.790]  That's super awesome. Yeah.
[01:05:17.830 --> 01:05:20.890]  Do you want to tell people how they can find you on social media so that they
[01:05:20.890 --> 01:05:24.190]  can stalk you and see your garden? Um, you can check me out on Instagram.
[01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:27.230]  Jesse grows. Um, I haven't been super active lately,
[01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:31.030]  but I'm sure when this big outdoor grow, uh,
[01:05:31.070 --> 01:05:33.670]  that I'm doing at work gets going, I'll be posting pictures of that.
[01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:36.270]  So go click like on what he's already got up there. You guys,
[01:05:36.270 --> 01:05:38.710]  you'll encourage him to post new stuff. Uh,
[01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:40.110]  since you've got a bunch of people listening to you,
[01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:43.470]  you got anything you want to say before we click stop on the recording? Um,
[01:05:43.930 --> 01:05:48.770]  just thanks for listening. Uh, what's up to my beautiful wife. Um,
[01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:53.130]  if you are in the state of Colorado and you're buying, uh,
[01:05:53.170 --> 01:05:57.010]  anything from Willie's reserve under the strain, uh,
[01:05:57.030 --> 01:06:01.010]  Gorilla glue, all the time, bubble gum, um,
[01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:05.570]  or granddaddy perp. I grew that. So fuck yeah. Good work, bro. Yeah. Congrats.
[01:06:05.810 --> 01:06:06.410]  Don't you love it?
[01:06:06.410 --> 01:06:08.930]  That people can come just buy products that you grew and you can tell them like,
[01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:11.110]  I did that before you had to kind of hide.
[01:06:11.310 --> 01:06:15.270]  So the, uh, the, we just sent them some, uh,
[01:06:15.830 --> 01:06:17.790]  bubble gum last week that they're going,
[01:06:18.050 --> 01:06:23.050]  they're going to turn the large shipment of cannabis into pre-rolls.
[01:06:23.790 --> 01:06:26.390]  They're not going to use trim or anything like that. Very cool.
[01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:30.190]  And that was one of the best batches of bubble gum I've grown so far. So nice.
[01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:34.950]  And that's a Willie stuff is expensive. I'll tell you what. Um,
[01:06:35.410 --> 01:06:39.130]  that's the cheapest way to get into it and get them while they're fresh still.
[01:06:39.290 --> 01:06:42.330]  So get them while they're fresh. You guys, you don't want your joints drying up.
[01:06:42.370 --> 01:06:44.370]  Nobody wants a crusty dried up pre-roll. All right.
[01:06:44.370 --> 01:06:45.450]  I want to thank everybody for listening.
[01:06:45.610 --> 01:06:49.330]  No advertisement or anything at the end of this podcast. Um, yeah,
[01:06:49.330 --> 01:06:52.490]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend bone Ellis for giving me a huge
[01:06:52.490 --> 01:06:55.350]  shout out on her podcast. I want to give a huge shout out to Jesse for joining
[01:06:55.350 --> 01:06:58.170]  me. Uh, thanks for everybody for listening. And until next time,
[01:06:58.210 --> 01:07:00.490]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:12.560]  I know this little girl. Her name is Maxi.
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:17.560]  Her beauty's like a bunch of rose. If I ever tell you about Maxi,
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:22.000]  you're gonna say I don't know what I know, but murder she wrote.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:27.000]  Murder she wrote. Murder she wrote.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000]  Murder she wrote.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:33.000]  I'm trying to know her name, her pretty face and bank character.
