[00:58.120 --> 01:02.880]  show Mike. Thanks man what's up everybody. Hope everybody's doing well. I hope
[01:02.880 --> 01:06.400]  you're doing well Mike. We brought Mike on to do what I'm going to call the
[01:06.400 --> 01:10.320]  legalization presentation but this is the part of the show where we usually
[01:10.320 --> 01:13.280]  talk about what we're smoking so I'm gonna be polite and I'm gonna ask you
[01:13.280 --> 01:17.520]  Mike what are you smoking on today bro? I'm gonna join some flower from one of
[01:17.520 --> 01:21.720]  our local dispensaries. Excellent flower from a local dispensary. I love your
[01:21.720 --> 01:27.840]  perfectly vague descriptions. That's what I'm going for and it's it's solid
[01:27.840 --> 01:34.120]  herb. Solid herb there we go. Some details. I heard one of the newer
[01:34.240 --> 01:38.360]  outfits in town had some good flowers so I went and checked it out. Rumors seem
[01:38.360 --> 01:43.520]  to be true and I've been enjoying it. Will you go back? Yeah definitely.
[01:43.520 --> 01:47.880]  Excellent. The gummies I like they have a for a few bucks cheaper a bottle than
[01:47.880 --> 01:51.760]  everybody else and their flowers good so I'll get some of my money for a while.
[01:51.760 --> 01:55.080]  Shit having flower on the shelf right now is a selling point a lot of the
[01:55.080 --> 01:59.320]  dispensaries are picked pretty clean. Yeah a lot of shelves are pretty empty
[01:59.440 --> 02:05.080]  lately and what's there's been kind of disappointing so having somebody that
[02:05.080 --> 02:09.920]  had several nice-looking selections was a pleasure to find. Excellent I never
[02:09.920 --> 02:12.520]  thought I would see empty shelves at this time of year and I haven't seen
[02:12.520 --> 02:15.880]  something like that in a long time. It's scary going into the dispensary right
[02:15.880 --> 02:20.560]  now with minimal selections. What are you enjoying right now buddy? Good question
[02:20.560 --> 02:25.200]  bro I am dabbing on Garlic Banger number nine live batter from Green Dot Labs. I'm
[02:25.200 --> 02:27.840]  sure you guys know Green Dot is one of my favorites for concentrate companies
[02:27.840 --> 02:31.600]  and of course anything with the word garlic in it is one of my favorites. The
[02:31.600 --> 02:37.680]  Garlic Banger is a blend of Headbanger and HSB. The HSB is Han Solo Burger. The
[02:37.680 --> 02:41.920]  package describes the flavor as garlic sour and gas on the back of the package
[02:41.920 --> 02:48.440]  it says 69.12% THC and non-detectable CBD. I love the Garlic Banger dude this is
[02:48.440 --> 02:53.120]  one of my probably top five concentrates and since I've been dabbing it I can't
[02:53.120 --> 02:57.400]  think of anything else so I don't know what the other top four are. So yeah
[02:57.400 --> 03:00.680]  that's perfect concentrate. Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for
[03:00.680 --> 03:05.560]  the mind-erasing and delicious tasting. That's a beautiful fucking description
[03:05.560 --> 03:09.720]  right there. The Garlic Banger number nine. There are two different numbers
[03:09.720 --> 03:13.000]  there's number six and number nine. I can't decide which one I like better but
[03:13.000 --> 03:16.920]  that's what I'm smoking on. Alright Mike let me get myself back on track. I'm
[03:16.920 --> 03:20.040]  going to give you a bunch of time and a bunch of space to do your legalization
[03:20.040 --> 03:24.600]  presentation but I do owe some friends some shout outs from Patreon so let's do
[03:24.600 --> 03:28.560]  some shout outs to the members of the 710 Club. Of course the 710 Club are the

[03:32.320 --> 03:35.760]  higher. So with no further ado let's start off with the big grow from your

[04:47.400 --> 04:48.000]  Thanks bro.
[04:48.400 --> 04:52.160]  Oh man, thank you for the support. You contribute to the show heavily. You have
[04:52.160 --> 04:56.720]  contributed behind the scenes heavily to my cannabis career. Without White Mike's
[04:56.720 --> 05:00.360]  involvement, without some of the foundation and bricks that you laid, my
[05:00.360 --> 05:04.160]  towers wouldn't be standing. So I do appreciate it bro. That is definitely, I
[05:04.160 --> 05:07.680]  notice it and it doesn't go unnoticed when I start thinking about the past and
[05:07.680 --> 05:09.560]  the future. You're always involved. So thank you bro.
[05:10.160 --> 05:12.440]  It's been like a decade now we've been building it.
[05:12.840 --> 05:16.080]  We have been playing together for quite a while and it has been a good time. It
[05:16.080 --> 05:19.080]  has been a good time. Been some scary moments, some rocky roads, but we always
[05:19.080 --> 05:20.200]  seem to do pretty well together.
[05:20.720 --> 05:25.600]  Moving into the old place, I found some relics from way back in the origin days
[05:25.600 --> 05:26.840]  and they all make me smile.
[05:27.400 --> 05:30.040]  Did you see the smile? Just when you said relics, I got excited.
[05:30.360 --> 05:33.440]  Finding spots for them in the new house is a lot of fun.
[05:33.680 --> 05:36.400]  Cool. Old business cards and old pictures and things.
[05:36.600 --> 05:37.440]  I was always going to smile.
[05:37.440 --> 05:40.960]  It was exactly that. It was one of your iRi cards from the Metamar days.
[05:41.040 --> 05:41.640]  Oh man.
[05:41.640 --> 05:45.000]  It was a caregiver card with your number across the back and I smiled. I was
[05:45.120 --> 05:46.360]  like, I wonder if this is the first one.
[05:46.960 --> 05:48.880]  That might have been dude. Awesome.
[05:48.880 --> 05:49.080]  Yep.
[05:49.680 --> 05:53.080]  Wow. Metamar days. If you know, you know.
[05:53.280 --> 05:55.880]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I have been teasing that we're going to let Mike
[05:55.880 --> 05:57.520]  have a bunch of space in this episode.
[05:57.520 --> 06:00.400]  I know I bring Mike on and I talk over him a lot.
[06:00.400 --> 06:02.040]  I'm trying to steer the show today.
[06:02.040 --> 06:03.800]  I'm going to steer the show very minimally.
[06:04.000 --> 06:07.680]  If I catch Mike out in left field, I will bring him back onto the train tracks.
[06:07.880 --> 06:11.400]  If I catch him too far off the microphone, I will glue his face back to the
[06:11.400 --> 06:12.400]  microphone for you.
[06:12.840 --> 06:14.400]  I'm trying to stay up on people.
[06:14.400 --> 06:14.920]  We hear you.
[06:15.120 --> 06:15.920]  Yes, we really are.
[06:15.920 --> 06:17.920]  And I'm trying not to sneeze into my microphone right now.
[06:17.920 --> 06:19.280]  So excuse me if it does happen.
[06:19.560 --> 06:24.400]  A lot of listeners have been asking for guidance on how to get into legalization,
[06:24.400 --> 06:26.240]  how to start joining city council meetings.
[06:26.480 --> 06:30.000]  Basically, where do I start to get to where you guys are now?
[06:30.200 --> 06:33.960]  Mike and I understand and appreciate and are grateful for the fact that we're in a
[06:33.960 --> 06:38.080]  location where we can drive to a store that's four minutes away and pay cash
[06:38.080 --> 06:42.280]  money for the top quality concentrates and not have to worry about police taking it
[06:42.280 --> 06:43.960]  from us, getting arrested, anything.
[06:44.080 --> 06:45.320]  We've got a lot of freedom here.
[06:45.520 --> 06:46.240]  We enjoy it.
[06:46.240 --> 06:49.960]  So Mike has been given the opportunity to put together what I'm calling the
[06:49.960 --> 06:52.760]  legalization presentation, just because I like silly shit like that.
[06:52.920 --> 06:55.880]  But I gave him some time to put something together and I'm giving him the format.
[06:56.280 --> 06:59.480]  I'm going to try to stay out of the way and not over talk you, but I'm just going
[06:59.480 --> 07:02.400]  to shut up now and say, Mike, the mic is yours, brother.
[07:02.560 --> 07:04.040]  Good luck and have fun, man.
[07:04.040 --> 07:07.480]  It's time for the white Mike's legalization presentation.
[07:07.480 --> 07:08.120]  Have at it, brother.
[07:08.840 --> 07:09.400]  Thanks, bro.
[07:10.120 --> 07:16.680]  Um, listeners, before we dive into this, it's kind of hard to know how far to go
[07:16.720 --> 07:18.440]  into some of these topics.
[07:19.040 --> 07:24.480]  Um, I've been studying legalization or the idea of it in one way or another for like
[07:24.480 --> 07:25.280]  20 years.
[07:25.760 --> 07:30.400]  So there's a lot of different talking points and arguments just sort of rattling
[07:30.400 --> 07:31.280]  around in my head.
[07:31.880 --> 07:40.400]  I've tried to hone it down to sort of the key starter package for what is anybody
[07:40.760 --> 07:46.960]  who's interested need to know, um, to be effective arguing for legalization in
[07:46.960 --> 07:47.680]  their area.
[07:48.240 --> 07:50.760]  I hope I've done a good job of narrowing it down.
[07:51.200 --> 07:56.480]  Um, if you want more information or would have appreciated less information, you can
[07:56.480 --> 07:57.760]  hit me up on social media.
[07:58.240 --> 08:02.960]  Um, it's at Nemo punk 15 on Twitter, or you can find me on Facebook at Pueblo for
[08:02.960 --> 08:08.560]  sensible cannabis laws, or you can get ahold of me by emailing the show, uh, links
[08:08.560 --> 08:10.280]  provided in the show notes.
[08:10.600 --> 08:11.000]  Perfect.
[08:11.040 --> 08:11.520]  Thank you, Mike.
[08:11.560 --> 08:13.760]  So legalization.
[08:14.920 --> 08:19.320]  Um, if you're getting into this argument right now, you're lucky.
[08:20.080 --> 08:23.040]  Uh, you've got a lot of good data to pull from.
[08:23.040 --> 08:30.080]  You've got a lot of other people's work to build on and study and sort of repurpose
[08:30.080 --> 08:31.400]  for your own arguments.
[08:32.640 --> 08:40.720]  Um, despite like 80 years of propaganda and bullshit in drug war nonsense, that's
[08:40.720 --> 08:42.520]  been built on top of cannabis.
[08:43.120 --> 08:50.000]  Um, we've got a lot of positives working in our favor and our favor during, for this
[08:50.000 --> 08:50.520]  argument.
[08:51.080 --> 08:56.200]  Um, prohibition is a concept is just crap.
[08:57.280 --> 09:01.640]  Um, going back to first prohibition, this is one of my favorite arguments.
[09:01.640 --> 09:06.840]  I S I steal it from a guy named Neil Franklin, Franklin, who's the founder of a group
[09:06.840 --> 09:09.240]  called law enforcement against prohibition.
[09:09.720 --> 09:15.080]  So a group of ex cops and judges that just saw prohibition in action and can't tolerate
[09:15.080 --> 09:15.560]  it anymore.
[09:15.560 --> 09:17.120]  So they formed a group to fight it.
[09:17.920 --> 09:24.120]  Um, and his, uh, his little comment was the very first prohibition is, um, God telling
[09:24.120 --> 09:26.480]  Adam and Eve, don't eat that apple.
[09:27.080 --> 09:28.920]  And God was the cop.
[09:28.960 --> 09:35.320]  He only had to watch two people in that apple got a quick, that's just how it goes.
[09:35.920 --> 09:39.080]  Um, there's a little human nature in that story too.
[09:39.080 --> 09:43.360]  Not only does prohibition, not a very good policy and it's hard to enforce, but it's
[09:43.360 --> 09:46.080]  sort of human nature to go, Oh, don't touch that.
[09:46.200 --> 09:49.720]  Does it, you know, it's just, you tell us not to.
[09:49.800 --> 09:55.640]  And the first thing our brain does is I wonder why, Oh, I'm going to try it and find out
[09:55.640 --> 09:56.080]  why.
[09:56.760 --> 10:01.920]  Um, and so when little old me, when they instituted dare, when I was in fifth or sixth
[10:01.920 --> 10:06.600]  grade or whenever they gave it to us, the first thing everyone in my class thought was,
[10:07.400 --> 10:09.520]  well, they're probably telling us about this cause it's fun.
[10:09.520 --> 10:10.720]  We should go find it and try.
[10:10.720 --> 10:11.080]  Yeah.
[10:11.160 --> 10:12.600]  That's exactly what I thought.
[10:13.600 --> 10:16.800]  And I thought it was weird then.
[10:17.240 --> 10:23.080]  And when I was in college and, and saw some studies where they looked at if dare worked
[10:23.600 --> 10:28.920]  and they found that the dare that we went through was zero to negative 2% effective.
[10:30.240 --> 10:34.400]  So for every hundred kids that went through the dare, I went through two of them that
[10:34.400 --> 10:36.160]  wouldn't have gone out to look for drugs.
[10:36.160 --> 10:39.080]  We're like, we should probably go try some drugs.
[10:39.600 --> 10:47.440]  So, um, if you're looking to get in and start arguing against cannabis prohibition in your
[10:47.440 --> 10:51.360]  area, know that you're not alone in that.
[10:51.560 --> 10:57.920]  It's not a crazy as argument is it might originally seem, especially if you come from a
[10:57.920 --> 11:01.480]  lot of the propaganda that we grew up in.
[11:02.120 --> 11:07.760]  Um, and then I know for a fact is still pretty prevalent, um, around the country, even in
[11:07.840 --> 11:12.520]  the U S right now where it seems like legalization is right around the corner, but it
[11:12.520 --> 11:16.920]  seemed like that since 1970 and we're still not there.
[11:18.760 --> 11:22.920]  So first prohibition is a terrible policy on its own, right?
[11:23.280 --> 11:28.320]  Second, cops were never meant to protect you from you.
[11:28.800 --> 11:31.320]  They were protect meant to protect you from me.
[11:31.760 --> 11:35.720]  Like if I go beat up Jeff, the cops can arrest me for beating up Jeff.
[11:36.080 --> 11:38.960]  But if I beat up me and I tell the cops, I kick my own ass.
[11:39.000 --> 11:41.600]  They're just going to look at me and go, well, what do you want us to do about it?
[11:42.360 --> 11:44.400]  And it's the same thing with drug laws.
[11:45.000 --> 11:51.400]  The trying to catch somebody who doesn't want to be caught and doesn't want to report the
[11:51.400 --> 11:52.600]  other people involved.
[11:52.840 --> 11:54.840]  It's just a really hard crime to solve.
[11:55.520 --> 12:00.680]  Um, cause nobody leaves, um, a typical pot deal upset.
[12:01.080 --> 12:02.760]  Somebody wanted to buy some marijuana.
[12:02.800 --> 12:04.440]  Somebody wanted to sell some marijuana.
[12:04.800 --> 12:09.360]  Those two connected and both left happy or at least not disgruntled.
[12:10.120 --> 12:14.600]  Um, unfortunately it doesn't always work that way because prohibition isn't, doesn't
[12:14.600 --> 12:17.640]  create an awesomely safe marketplace.
[12:18.240 --> 12:23.920]  But in theory, both parties are there for their own ends and those ends get met
[12:23.920 --> 12:26.240]  quickly and everybody goes home happy.
[12:27.160 --> 12:30.800]  Um, it's not like an assault where there's somebody that got their ass kicked.
[12:30.800 --> 12:31.840]  That's salty about it.
[12:31.920 --> 12:32.200]  Right.
[12:32.720 --> 12:34.280]  No victim, no crime is what you're saying.
[12:34.920 --> 12:35.920]  Very much so.
[12:36.000 --> 12:43.320]  And, and moralists or prohibitionists love to paint, you know, it's a moral failing or
[12:43.320 --> 12:48.320]  some sort of other nonsense on the why smoking a joint in the privacy of your own home
[12:48.320 --> 12:52.280]  should be really, really terrible and a crime that needs to be prevented.
[12:52.760 --> 12:53.920]  Punished, not prevented.
[12:53.920 --> 12:54.200]  It's nonsense.
[12:54.200 --> 12:54.720]  Punished.
[12:55.520 --> 13:01.720]  Um, and when you start breaking down, especially now where, I mean, Colorado has
[13:01.760 --> 13:05.280]  been legal for eight years now.
[13:05.520 --> 13:07.160]  The law passed in 2012.
[13:08.240 --> 13:10.720]  Um, all of 2013 was a planning year.
[13:10.720 --> 13:12.360]  Stores have been open since 2014.
[13:12.360 --> 13:15.440]  That's six years we've had dispensary retail dispensaries.
[13:15.920 --> 13:18.440]  We've had medical dispensary since oh, eight.
[13:19.040 --> 13:21.760]  Callie's had medical dispensary since 2000.
[13:22.480 --> 13:24.400]  Um, that's 20 years now.
[13:24.640 --> 13:26.840]  And society hasn't tipped over.
[13:27.160 --> 13:28.720]  It hasn't gone insane.
[13:29.360 --> 13:35.760]  Um, try as they might, you can't pin a lot of mayhem on legal cannabis.
[13:35.760 --> 13:41.200]  That's why Canada followed Colorado and Washington state and legalization.
[13:41.560 --> 13:42.600]  So is Uruguay.
[13:42.600 --> 13:44.240]  So is Mexico now, I believe.
[13:45.280 --> 13:50.640]  Um, we're clearly headed towards a world where cannabis is legal.
[13:51.200 --> 14:00.390]  And at this point, there's a lot of good data that you can draw on to make your
[14:00.390 --> 14:04.390]  arguments much more impactful than mine were when I started.
[14:04.950 --> 14:07.870]  Um, cause when I started a lot of this was theoretical.
[14:08.390 --> 14:12.310]  And so when you were trying to explain to people that if there's a legal market,
[14:12.350 --> 14:16.030]  the black market kind of goes away, they'd look at you funny.
[14:16.030 --> 14:20.550]  And now you can show them that that's where $7 billion worth of cannabis sales
[14:20.590 --> 14:24.510]  comes from and the legal market around the U S right now, those aren't new
[14:24.510 --> 14:28.710]  customers, their existing customers spending dollars they would have spent.
[14:28.710 --> 14:32.190]  Anyway, they're just choosing to shop in a regulated market now.
[14:32.430 --> 14:33.470]  7 billion.
[14:34.310 --> 14:36.270]  It's that's an old number.
[14:36.270 --> 14:38.350]  Even it's probably nine or 11 now.
[14:38.670 --> 14:40.430]  And that was just the legal market.
[14:40.870 --> 14:41.190]  Wow.
[14:41.430 --> 14:48.710]  Um, good estimates on the, like, it's, it's easier to know, like the size of the
[14:48.710 --> 14:54.030]  cosmetics market or the denim market in the U S because the sales figures are
[14:54.030 --> 14:57.990]  easier to track than it is with the illegal businesses.
[14:57.990 --> 15:03.950]  But, uh, um, the DEA has been putting out estimates every year for, I mean, since
[15:03.950 --> 15:09.990]  the seventies estimating the size of, of different drug markets in the U S and
[15:09.990 --> 15:14.550]  they put the, the U S cannabis market somewhere North of 35 billion.
[15:15.390 --> 15:17.910]  Um, and that's a really old number.
[15:17.910 --> 15:21.230]  My guess is it's closer to 50 to 60.
[15:21.470 --> 15:21.750]  Wow.
[15:21.950 --> 15:24.070]  And those are, those are prohibition dollars.
[15:24.070 --> 15:28.670]  And so there's a huge markup because it's an illegal product.
[15:29.350 --> 15:35.630]  Um, but if you figured about a third of that, so 25, $30 billion is what the, the
[15:35.630 --> 15:38.670]  U S market is potentially for legal cannabis.
[15:39.310 --> 15:43.630]  And right now the legal market's about 11 billion strong, I think 10 or 11.
[15:43.910 --> 15:44.590]  It's a lot of money.
[15:44.630 --> 15:47.990]  So there's a lot of black market money still on the table for
[15:47.990 --> 15:49.470]  the legal market to scoop up.
[15:50.430 --> 15:54.910]  But when I was first making this argument, it was hard to get all
[15:54.910 --> 15:56.510]  of that information in front of people.
[15:56.510 --> 15:58.470]  The internet didn't exist like it does today.
[15:58.470 --> 16:03.190]  Even, um, you didn't have people like me coaching you on podcasts.
[16:03.190 --> 16:04.390]  The data wasn't there yet.
[16:05.150 --> 16:07.590]  Even in libraries, you had trouble finding books about it.
[16:07.590 --> 16:13.390]  So, um, I mean, the landscape is vastly different now, and that
[16:13.390 --> 16:14.830]  all plays to our benefit.
[16:15.630 --> 16:20.870]  Um, even if you're, you're arguing to someone who is staunchly anti
[16:20.870 --> 16:25.750]  legalization, they've been exposed to a lot of these arguments and talking
[16:25.750 --> 16:30.230]  points and know that you're not just a crazy hippie shouting nonsense.
[16:30.950 --> 16:36.150]  Um, cause that's kind of what it felt like when, when I started, um, there
[16:36.150 --> 16:41.390]  was a real sense that you had to overcome the Cheech and Chong kind of
[16:42.190 --> 16:45.110]  veil that automatically got thrown over you.
[16:45.110 --> 16:48.790]  As soon as you said, I'm here to talk about cannabis, they'd go,
[16:50.270 --> 16:51.910]  yeah, just immediately.
[16:52.550 --> 16:57.430]  You had to overcome tons of bullshit because you were the cannabis guy.
[16:58.230 --> 17:00.350]  And that's not so true anymore.
[17:00.350 --> 17:01.070]  It's still true.
[17:01.070 --> 17:03.430]  It's just not nearly as true as it used to be.
[17:04.270 --> 17:08.550]  Um, and you've got a lot more firepower and it's way easier to back it up now.
[17:09.430 --> 17:17.230]  Uh, for example, um, one of the things you're going to want to do if you're,
[17:17.270 --> 17:21.750]  you're going to start arguing for legalization in your area, my biggest
[17:21.750 --> 17:27.430]  tip for you is to just learn and read and watch as much as you can on cannabis.
[17:27.910 --> 17:29.230]  Cannabis prohibition.
[17:29.230 --> 17:32.910]  If you just type in cannabis documentaries into YouTube, you're
[17:32.910 --> 17:35.070]  going to find dozens of good ones.
[17:35.430 --> 17:37.070]  Same thing with Netflix.
[17:37.790 --> 17:42.430]  Um, grab a pen, uh, hit pause real quick, go grab a pen.
[17:42.830 --> 17:46.430]  Some examples that you're definitely going to want to familiarize yourself
[17:46.430 --> 17:48.110]  with if you haven't already.
[17:49.030 --> 17:53.150]  The union, uh, subtitle, the business behind getting high.
[17:53.350 --> 17:53.830]  It's a good one.
[17:53.830 --> 17:55.790]  Find that on YouTube for sure.
[17:56.150 --> 17:59.110]  Same thing with a documentary called the culture high.
[17:59.950 --> 18:03.630]  Um, I'm pretty sure waiting to inhale is still available on YouTube.
[18:03.630 --> 18:06.430]  If it's not, I'm, I know you can find it searching on the
[18:06.470 --> 18:07.310]  internet for a minute.
[18:08.270 --> 18:12.790]  Um, if you're more of a reader, check out a book called my medicine
[18:12.790 --> 18:14.750]  by a guy named urban Rosenfeld.
[18:15.590 --> 18:22.030]  Um, fantastic book, uh, gives you an insider's view of the very earliest
[18:22.030 --> 18:24.430]  days of medical marijuana in the U S.
[18:25.030 --> 18:28.150]  And it's a story almost nobody knows about.
[18:28.790 --> 18:31.830]  Um, and when you tell people they think you're fucking with them, like the
[18:31.830 --> 18:36.230]  federal government's run a medical marijuana program since 1982, where
[18:36.230 --> 18:43.830]  they mail people, um, tens with, I think it's 11 ounces per 10 in pre-rolled
[18:43.830 --> 18:48.070]  joints, like even saying it right now, it sounds like I'm making shit up, but
[18:48.070 --> 18:51.710]  it's real, you can go on YouTube, you can see the 10, you can see the joints.
[18:51.710 --> 18:53.750]  You can hear the testimonials from these people.
[18:55.310 --> 18:59.670]  Um, there's a lot, a lot of history to draw from now that just
[18:59.670 --> 19:01.270]  wasn't accessible when I started.
[19:01.390 --> 19:06.590]  Um, so absorb, read and learn everything you can and get used to thinking.
[19:07.910 --> 19:13.030]  Of the arguments that you're hearing people make in terms of where you
[19:13.030 --> 19:14.870]  would like to see the law change.
[19:15.390 --> 19:20.350]  So if you're watching a documentary, say the union, a lot of it's set in British
[19:20.350 --> 19:24.390]  Columbia, um, cause I think that one's from 2004, 2007.
[19:24.830 --> 19:31.030]  And so at the time, one of the hotspots for cannabis production was British
[19:31.030 --> 19:36.510]  Columbia and one of the desirable selling points for flower in the country
[19:36.510 --> 19:38.430]  was this is from British Columbia.
[19:39.030 --> 19:39.390]  Wow.
[19:40.470 --> 19:44.470]  And so the whole documentary sort of details what the black market's
[19:44.470 --> 19:46.550]  like in that point in time.
[19:47.310 --> 19:47.790]  And.
[19:48.550 --> 19:51.990]  Is there talking, take the numbers they're saying and apply them to your
[19:51.990 --> 19:53.790]  town or your city or your state.
[19:54.470 --> 19:59.150]  And when you start conveying this information to other people in your area
[19:59.150 --> 20:04.070]  and pointing to different data sets that are publicly available, those
[20:04.070 --> 20:06.270]  arguments are extremely impactful.
[20:06.870 --> 20:11.030]  When you can say, you know, our town has 160,000 people in it.
[20:11.510 --> 20:17.350]  If we were to legalize marijuana, the numbers say that we would be making
[20:17.350 --> 20:19.350]  around, you know, a million a year.
[20:19.350 --> 20:23.110]  And if we allowed production as well, we'd be looking at another
[20:23.110 --> 20:25.310]  million or so in excise tax.
[20:26.110 --> 20:29.910]  And all of a sudden your city councilman who didn't really want to listen to
[20:29.910 --> 20:34.430]  the stoner guy again today is thinking, well, that's two and a half million
[20:34.430 --> 20:38.430]  dollars that I could put towards this pet project or that pet project.
[20:39.470 --> 20:44.670]  Um, and all of a sudden you've got them hooked into your archive and
[20:44.670 --> 20:47.910]  you're like, well, I'm going to put $2.5 million into this project.
[20:48.110 --> 20:50.350]  You've got them hooked into your argument a little bit better.
[20:52.270 --> 20:55.830]  While you're reading and learning and watching everything you can on
[20:55.830 --> 21:02.150]  cannabis and prohibition, also check out local meetings in your area.
[21:02.670 --> 21:04.790]  I always recommend start local.
[21:05.150 --> 21:08.510]  If you've never argued in front of a governing body before, don't
[21:08.510 --> 21:10.110]  start at a state legislature.
[21:10.110 --> 21:11.950]  It's very intimidating.
[21:12.590 --> 21:15.430]  Um, started a town meeting or a city council.
[21:16.390 --> 21:20.870]  These meetings are open to the public and because there's a plague on in the
[21:20.870 --> 21:26.110]  whole world's upside down because of COVID, all of these are open on the web
[21:26.110 --> 21:28.350]  now, and they're very easily accessible.
[21:28.870 --> 21:35.150]  Um, two minutes on Google and you're able to find when your city council or town
[21:35.270 --> 21:39.750]  committee or whatever they're called meet, um, what time and day the meetings
[21:39.750 --> 21:45.110]  are, how to view them remotely and watch a lot of that.
[21:45.430 --> 21:50.550]  Like as much as you can stomach and I it's most boring shit you'll ever see.
[21:50.710 --> 21:53.870]  Um, it's sort of my superpower is being able to sit through
[21:53.870 --> 21:55.350]  these meetings and not die.
[21:56.190 --> 22:01.230]  Um, that's the skill set that I bring to the cannabis community.
[22:01.910 --> 22:09.270]  But, uh, if you want to go down to city council and say, city council, we should
[22:09.270 --> 22:13.190]  break with a hundred years now of tradition and legalize cannabis.
[22:13.990 --> 22:14.990]  Here's why.
[22:15.150 --> 22:20.870]  And you want that, that message to be well received and appreciated.
[22:21.510 --> 22:26.590]  Um, your best bet is to watch a lot of city council meetings, or if you want to
[22:26.590 --> 22:31.670]  do a state assembly, a state assembly meeting and get used to how those are
[22:31.670 --> 22:37.910]  meetings are run, what the flow is, um, what all the procedures are, who all the
[22:37.910 --> 22:43.110]  players are, who does what, who says what, what order things happen in.
[22:43.950 --> 22:52.630]  Um, I've seen a lot of people go and look very foolish because they go with
[22:52.670 --> 22:59.990]  zero preparation and a hundred percent passion and it's the taking the time and
[22:59.990 --> 23:07.630]  sitting through meeting after meeting about zoning code and fire code and
[23:08.190 --> 23:13.470]  watching the little old lady speak about people speeding on our street or the loud
[23:13.470 --> 23:19.030]  music at night or watching the big city presentation where a whole block of
[23:19.030 --> 23:23.590]  people have come down to, to rally because too many garbage trucks go down
[23:23.590 --> 23:24.830]  their alley every week.
[23:25.350 --> 23:31.670]  You really get a feel for how your city runs, who the important players are, who
[23:31.670 --> 23:33.110]  the decision makers are.
[23:33.870 --> 23:38.310]  And the more you watch, the more you learn what those people care about.
[23:38.670 --> 23:42.790]  So you can really tailor your arguments and make them effective.
[23:43.510 --> 23:51.030]  Um, say somebody is really passionate about the police and they want the police
[23:51.030 --> 23:55.390]  to reinvest more time into more important type crimes.
[23:55.870 --> 24:01.030]  You can point it out that in Colorado, a state with 5.7 something million people,
[24:01.470 --> 24:05.110]  we have 6,000 fewer marijuana arrests per year now.
[24:05.830 --> 24:11.270]  And that's those 6,000, Hey, I caught Mike and Jeff smoking a joint behind the
[24:11.270 --> 24:11.870]  Arby's.
[24:12.590 --> 24:17.070]  And I had to, you know, handcuff them, pat them down, put them in the back of the
[24:17.070 --> 24:20.150]  squad car, take them to the jail, process them.
[24:20.590 --> 24:21.950]  It's just a minor offense.
[24:21.950 --> 24:23.030]  We do some paperwork.
[24:23.030 --> 24:25.310]  We take some pictures there.
[24:25.390 --> 24:27.990]  They go home seven hours later.
[24:28.750 --> 24:31.190]  Takes about three hours of the officer's time.
[24:32.150 --> 24:35.510]  We don't do that 6,000 times a year now.
[24:36.510 --> 24:39.110]  And that those man hours add up.
[24:40.110 --> 24:45.030]  Like if you do the math, the normal 40 hour work week is 2080 hours a year.
[24:45.790 --> 24:50.910]  And that's if you work five days a week, 40 hours a week, uh, or not five days a
[24:50.910 --> 24:52.310]  week, but 40 hours a week.
[24:53.070 --> 24:54.670]  I am 52 weeks a year.
[24:54.670 --> 24:55.710]  It's 2080.
[24:56.590 --> 25:00.230]  6,000 arrests at two or three hours per arrest.
[25:01.070 --> 25:03.790]  It's 12 to 18,000 man hours.
[25:03.790 --> 25:04.470]  We just freed up.
[25:05.510 --> 25:07.750]  And how many rapes can you solve in that time?
[25:07.750 --> 25:09.550]  How many murders can you solve in that time?
[25:10.230 --> 25:17.150]  Um, if you're, you're somebody is on the other side of that particular coin and
[25:17.150 --> 25:20.390]  is fired up about police abuse of power.
[25:21.350 --> 25:25.750]  90% of the videos where the cop pulls somebody over and decides to fuck with
[25:25.750 --> 25:28.870]  that, somebody, it starts with Jeff.
[25:28.870 --> 25:30.390]  I smell marijuana in your car.
[25:30.390 --> 25:31.430]  Would you please step out?
[25:31.430 --> 25:33.670]  It's it's always, I smell weed.
[25:33.990 --> 25:35.270]  They never smell meth.
[25:35.430 --> 25:36.950]  They never smell heroin.
[25:37.390 --> 25:39.510]  They, they rarely smell alcohol.
[25:39.910 --> 25:41.430]  It's always, I smell weed.
[25:42.190 --> 25:46.590]  And if I smell weed is no longer reason to fuck with people that just
[25:46.590 --> 25:47.750]  takes that off the menu.
[25:48.670 --> 25:54.230]  Um, if somebody has got a passion project where they want to fund something, the
[25:54.230 --> 25:58.790]  data is there now where you can look up and say, there's this many people in our
[25:58.790 --> 25:59.350]  city.
[25:59.790 --> 26:04.670]  If we use the numbers in Colorado, then there's no reason to say they shouldn't
[26:04.670 --> 26:13.910]  apply to say New York or Wyoming or, or Australia that our area could likely see
[26:13.990 --> 26:15.870]  this much money coming in every year.
[26:16.390 --> 26:18.630]  And we can put that towards whatever we want.
[26:19.390 --> 26:22.790]  And all of a sudden you've got a bunch of people who started off not
[26:22.790 --> 26:24.350]  wanting to even listen to you.
[26:24.910 --> 26:30.270]  Now they're thinking about, you know, we're already buying and selling the pot.
[26:30.310 --> 26:32.310]  Like everybody who wants it gets it here.
[26:32.870 --> 26:38.350]  Prohibition is such a terrible policy that it's literally created a marketplace
[26:38.350 --> 26:40.910]  where every high school has a distribution center.
[26:41.310 --> 26:41.590]  Yeah.
[26:41.950 --> 26:47.910]  Like you couldn't dream up a worse distribution system than the one
[26:47.910 --> 26:49.110]  prohibition created.
[26:49.790 --> 26:52.910]  If you were trying to keep drugs out of the hands of people who shouldn't be on
[26:52.910 --> 26:55.310]  drugs, I agree.
[26:55.350 --> 26:58.750]  It's just prohibition's bad on in every way.
[26:59.470 --> 27:07.830]  And the more you learn about the history of cannabis prohibition, the medical
[27:07.830 --> 27:13.790]  effects of cannabis, the health effects of cannabis, what's happened in states
[27:13.790 --> 27:20.470]  since they've legalized or since they've allowed medical and how much it costs to
[27:20.470 --> 27:22.750]  try to enforce all this and prohibit it.
[27:23.430 --> 27:26.270]  It gets really easy to start.
[27:27.030 --> 27:27.550]  Okay.
[27:27.550 --> 27:29.470]  I listened to this meeting for 10 hours.
[27:29.470 --> 27:32.190]  I figured out what this guy and this guy really care about.
[27:32.670 --> 27:34.430]  I know how to sway their boats my way.
[27:34.430 --> 27:36.910]  Now I just have to tailor the argument like, so.
[27:38.310 --> 27:42.750]  So it's just, it's really just about doing your prep work and knowing who your target
[27:42.750 --> 27:45.670]  audience is and then getting comfortable.
[27:45.670 --> 27:50.230]  And if you watch the proceedings enough, you'll get comfortable enough to know when
[27:50.710 --> 27:55.750]  and how to do your five minute spiel on why your area should legalize pot.
[27:57.430 --> 28:01.470]  It's really just about the prep work and you're lucky.
[28:01.510 --> 28:02.870]  The documentaries now are good.
[28:04.430 --> 28:06.950]  They didn't even exist when me and Jeff were starting.
[28:07.350 --> 28:07.630]  Yeah.
[28:07.630 --> 28:10.190]  You guys are spoiled now and you're welcome.
[28:11.430 --> 28:15.550]  We have some fun notes we've got here just to give you all some fun numbers to think
[28:15.550 --> 28:16.070]  about.
[28:17.310 --> 28:23.990]  Um, in 2019, the state of Colorado, like I said, 5.7 million people.
[28:24.750 --> 28:34.790]  Uh, we collected 302 million, 458,426 dollars in cannabis taxes in 2019.
[28:35.390 --> 28:40.630]  And every report I've read this year says our sales numbers are way higher during
[28:40.630 --> 28:41.150]  COVID.
[28:41.750 --> 28:45.790]  So we're going to crush that number next or this year.
[28:46.190 --> 28:48.830]  302 million dollars.
[28:49.230 --> 28:49.730]  Yep.
[28:50.350 --> 28:54.790]  Um, New York, for example, has got 8.3 million people.
[28:55.470 --> 28:57.110]  I'm almost 8.4.
[28:57.710 --> 29:03.910]  They're looking at a projected revenue of 436 million a year.
[29:04.470 --> 29:08.390]  If they get on the legalization train, they haven't yet.
[29:08.430 --> 29:13.750]  They're, they continually fumble the ball, trying to craft the perfect legalization
[29:13.750 --> 29:19.270]  model rather than letting, uh, what's the phrase they're letting the perfect get in
[29:19.270 --> 29:20.070]  the way of the good.
[29:20.830 --> 29:24.510]  So rather than making any progress, they keep talking about how next year they're
[29:24.510 --> 29:26.430]  going to make the perfect leap forward.
[29:28.110 --> 29:31.750]  Um, we did the cop hours that we could save.
[29:33.230 --> 29:37.030]  Different ways you can argue for legalization in your area.
[29:37.070 --> 29:41.750]  If you don't want to go sacrifice yourself on the alter at city council, like I did,
[29:42.470 --> 29:50.030]  um, writing op-eds to your local paper or a larger paper is super, super easy to do.
[29:50.710 --> 29:54.070]  Um, some things you should know that will make you more confident.
[29:54.790 --> 30:00.430]  Um, every newspaper has an op-ed section and they're desperate for free content.
[30:00.950 --> 30:05.470]  So the odds, your letter gets published, um, are pretty good.
[30:05.470 --> 30:10.790]  If you follow a few really simple rules, if you click on their submission criteria,
[30:10.790 --> 30:14.630]  which will be easy to find on their papers website, you can go to the Denver post,
[30:14.630 --> 30:16.030]  click the opinion section.
[30:16.630 --> 30:23.150]  And if you scroll to the bottom, there will be a tab that says, submit an op-ed
[30:23.350 --> 30:25.910]  and it'll tell you, here's your word limit.
[30:26.510 --> 30:27.590]  Don't cuss.
[30:28.070 --> 30:29.270]  Don't make it personal.
[30:29.910 --> 30:35.150]  And if you do that, there's like an 85% chance they'll publish your letter.
[30:35.150 --> 30:36.310]  Doesn't matter what it's about.
[30:37.390 --> 30:42.550]  You could be bitching about the ducks at the city park or the people driving fast
[30:42.550 --> 30:46.630]  on your street or different marijuana laws in your area.
[30:47.270 --> 30:50.310]  And, uh, another important piece of information.
[30:50.790 --> 30:56.830]  Most newspapers have no way to double check who your name is on the bottom of the
[30:56.830 --> 30:57.150]  letter.
[30:57.910 --> 31:03.110]  And so I can write a letter and say, my name's Jeff and they'll publish it saying
[31:03.110 --> 31:03.830]  Jeff wrote it.
[31:03.870 --> 31:07.230]  And then Jeff will call me and be like, what the fuck dude, if you're going to
[31:07.230 --> 31:08.870]  submit a letter under my name, tell me.
[31:09.630 --> 31:09.790]  Yeah.
[31:10.470 --> 31:12.270]  But you don't have to use your name.
[31:12.310 --> 31:16.790]  There's famous examples of people in our history who wrote wonderful, impactful
[31:16.790 --> 31:18.630]  op-eds to the paper under pseudonyms.
[31:18.670 --> 31:20.270]  Benjamin Franklin famously did it.
[31:21.230 --> 31:25.790]  Um, but op-eds are really kind of oddly powerful.
[31:26.430 --> 31:29.990]  Um, it's 2020 and we're, we all decided to be dumb.
[31:30.590 --> 31:37.350]  And so most people can't tell the difference between a fact investigated report and an
[31:37.350 --> 31:38.150]  opinion letter.
[31:39.070 --> 31:44.030]  And so your opinion letter to the editor is already going to have more impact than it
[31:44.030 --> 31:45.790]  probably should because it's an opinion.
[31:46.590 --> 31:48.430]  Um, but nobody can tell that anymore.
[31:49.630 --> 31:53.910]  Um, and the other thing with, uh, writing op-eds is they get picked up.
[31:53.950 --> 31:58.390]  They get, they get, if, uh, they get a lot of clicks on the local paper, they'll get
[31:58.390 --> 32:01.750]  picked up by the national outlet and other people will discuss it.
[32:02.390 --> 32:06.710]  And all of a sudden elected officials are being asked, did you see the op-ed in
[32:06.710 --> 32:10.750]  Sunday's paper that, you know, from, from Ross to Jeff that said we should legalize
[32:10.750 --> 32:11.070]  weed.
[32:11.630 --> 32:13.350]  What do you think about that mayor?
[32:13.750 --> 32:19.230]  And all of a sudden it's a major news story that's, that's generating more than just
[32:19.630 --> 32:21.790]  people saw it and got to read your arguments.
[32:23.630 --> 32:31.470]  Um, my other big tip is stay informed as much as possible on what's going on in your
[32:31.470 --> 32:34.030]  local area, in your state and nationally.
[32:34.670 --> 32:40.950]  Um, especially if you're regularly arguing for legalization and that's really what it
[32:40.950 --> 32:41.310]  takes.
[32:41.390 --> 32:48.390]  Um, the places that haven't moved in the U S anyway on legalization are almost
[32:48.390 --> 32:56.990]  exclusively places now where someone in elected office has to submit a bill to change
[32:56.990 --> 32:57.510]  the law.
[32:58.070 --> 33:02.630]  The general public can't put a petition together and get it on the ballot themselves.
[33:03.270 --> 33:08.150]  So you've got to convince somebody that holds elective office to submit the change
[33:08.150 --> 33:08.750]  for you.
[33:08.750 --> 33:11.670]  And you do that by pestering the fuck out of them.
[33:12.350 --> 33:19.430]  And every day, every week, every month, however often you can send that person an
[33:19.430 --> 33:21.390]  email, call their office.
[33:21.950 --> 33:23.270]  Hey, it's me again.
[33:23.390 --> 33:27.470]  Just want to remind you if marijuana were legal, we'd have an extra this much in the
[33:27.470 --> 33:28.550]  state budget this month.
[33:28.990 --> 33:29.990]  Have a nice Wednesday.
[33:30.830 --> 33:36.630]  Um, Hey, I saw you wanted, you know, more money for snow removal and in district one
[33:36.630 --> 33:37.230]  next year.
[33:37.230 --> 33:38.350]  But you can't find it in the budget.
[33:38.990 --> 33:42.910]  I know how you could just contact me next month.
[33:43.630 --> 33:47.870]  Just keep sending emails, keep calling, keep pestering those people.
[33:47.990 --> 33:55.790]  And if you make your arguments short, concise, and tuned to their cares and their wants
[33:55.790 --> 33:59.630]  and needs, you're going to have an impact and it's not going to take as long as you
[33:59.630 --> 34:00.190]  think it will.
[34:00.190 --> 34:04.230]  We're so lucky now we've overcome so much of this shit that we, and baggage that we've
[34:04.230 --> 34:06.470]  been carrying in this movement for so long.
[34:07.030 --> 34:10.470]  The internet finally freed up enough information.
[34:10.470 --> 34:12.750]  I think I agree.
[34:12.950 --> 34:14.950]  The shows like this dude shows like this.
[34:16.670 --> 34:21.430]  I think that's about what I've got straightened or lined out so far.
[34:21.430 --> 34:23.430]  What, uh, any questions for me, Jeff?
[34:23.790 --> 34:27.470]  You know, the only note I wrote down and I'm going to say this, I'm going to say this
[34:27.470 --> 34:27.990]  for me, Jeff.
[34:28.270 --> 34:31.670]  You know, the only note I wrote down and this is kind of, it's related.
[34:31.790 --> 34:34.750]  Do you have any favorite activists that we should follow or listen to or people that
[34:34.750 --> 34:35.870]  can give us some guidance?
[34:36.390 --> 34:39.830]  Um, definitely follow Marijuana Moment.
[34:40.030 --> 34:42.390]  Um, you can subscribe to a newsletter.
[34:42.390 --> 34:43.750]  You can check in with a website.
[34:43.750 --> 34:45.870]  You can follow the, those guys on Twitter.
[34:46.510 --> 34:49.670]  Um, fantastic cannabis reporting.
[34:50.430 --> 34:56.110]  Um, Russ Belville, if you're really into data, Russ is one of the best data miners
[34:56.110 --> 34:57.070]  I've ever seen.
[34:57.750 --> 35:00.390]  Um, it was like a dog with a bone.
[35:00.910 --> 35:07.270]  Radical Russ will dig into some talking point like a fucking honey badger and then post
[35:07.270 --> 35:09.150]  all the data for free to his website.
[35:09.430 --> 35:09.830]  Awesome.
[35:09.870 --> 35:14.670]  Um, and so if, if there's a marijuana talking point that you really want to deep dive
[35:14.670 --> 35:20.030]  data on, but don't really feel like doing all that legwork yourself, you can check in
[35:20.030 --> 35:23.350]  with radical Russ and see if he's already done it for you and wants to point you in
[35:23.350 --> 35:24.110]  the right direction.
[35:25.110 --> 35:30.190]  Um, definitely check those documentaries that I listed before.
[35:31.190 --> 35:34.550]  Um, check in with your local normal office.
[35:35.270 --> 35:39.150]  Um, check out Law Enforcement Against Prohibition or LEAP.
[35:39.910 --> 35:43.190]  Um, they do some interesting stuff around the country every year.
[35:43.830 --> 35:49.110]  Um, lots of good advocacy work about, uh, all sorts of stuff, not just prohibition
[35:49.110 --> 35:54.270]  being horrible policy, but, uh, um, lots of law enforcement reform stuff type too.
[35:54.990 --> 35:58.590]  Um, if you follow me on Twitter, you'll see me retweeting a lot of their stuff or a lot
[35:58.590 --> 35:59.950]  of their members stuff.
[36:00.390 --> 36:02.390]  Mike tweets a lot of great cannabis content.
[36:02.390 --> 36:04.430]  So just follow Mike on Twitter for sure.
[36:04.750 --> 36:07.030]  Uh, that will give you a good heads up on things to follow.
[36:07.990 --> 36:08.150]  Yeah.
[36:08.190 --> 36:11.150]  My Twitter is pretty good for stay informed on cannabis stuff.
[36:11.150 --> 36:12.070]  I stay up on that.
[36:12.310 --> 36:12.630]  Yes.
[36:12.670 --> 36:16.070]  Uh, at Nemo Punk 15 on the Twitter, give the, give the guy a follow.
[36:16.630 --> 36:18.350]  Uh, Mike, I see you scrolling through your notes there.
[36:18.350 --> 36:19.430]  Have we covered everything?
[36:19.430 --> 36:22.470]  Is it time to start wrapping up the, uh, this is going to be part one.
[36:22.470 --> 36:26.590]  All the talking ports, parts I want, this can definitely be part one.
[36:27.310 --> 36:30.310]  Um, I've got some little notes down.
[36:30.310 --> 36:32.030]  Like what was it?
[36:32.030 --> 36:36.070]  Me or Jeff, me and Jeff are in a city called Pueblo, Colorado.
[36:36.790 --> 36:39.270]  Um, our population is about 160,000.
[36:40.190 --> 36:45.030]  Um, our little city that has eight dispensaries.
[36:45.030 --> 36:48.590]  And this wasn't, this number is from when we only had seven up and running in 2018.
[36:49.310 --> 36:55.430]  Um, we see better than a million in taxes and fees and that's not
[36:55.470 --> 36:57.230]  production or excise tax yet.
[36:57.710 --> 37:05.590]  That's just seven stores doing their daily business, paying sales tax on it and, and
[37:05.590 --> 37:07.470]  paying their licensing fees to operate.
[37:07.950 --> 37:09.150]  It's an insane number.
[37:09.350 --> 37:11.270]  It's a million bucks that goes into the economy.
[37:12.310 --> 37:12.590]  Yeah.
[37:12.830 --> 37:14.030]  That's a new fire station, right?
[37:14.030 --> 37:17.510]  It's close to, you could at least build the structure and get build a damn fire station.
[37:17.630 --> 37:18.230]  You're welcome.
[37:20.350 --> 37:23.990]  It's a, I don't know what a fire station is.
[37:23.990 --> 37:28.750]  When you get into, when you get into city and state budgets, the numbers get really big
[37:28.750 --> 37:35.270]  quick and like Colorado's pulling in 300, 300 million plus in marijuana taxes every
[37:35.270 --> 37:37.990]  year, and it's 1% of our state budget.
[37:39.070 --> 37:43.270]  Um, and those two numbers in your head are kind of hard to hold at the same time.
[37:43.270 --> 37:48.150]  At least if you're me, um, cause $300 million, like if I had that personally, like
[37:48.630 --> 37:50.190]  my life would be kush for forever.
[37:50.190 --> 37:54.990]  Even if I did dumb shit, expensive dumb shit every day, 300 million is enough to
[37:54.990 --> 37:56.230]  get me through all the days.
[37:56.270 --> 37:58.990]  It'd be competitively trying to spend through that money.
[37:59.550 --> 38:02.710]  But at the, at the state level, it doesn't go that far.
[38:02.750 --> 38:06.830]  When you figure out how much a highway costs to build or a school system costs to
[38:06.830 --> 38:10.910]  maintain, um, it's the law, large numbers.
[38:10.910 --> 38:15.150]  When there's this many of us, um, shit just costs a lot.
[38:16.430 --> 38:22.750]  And so when you're making, especially the economic argument, keep in mind that it's
[38:22.750 --> 38:29.070]  not going to be a golden parachute kind of magic bullet, but that money can do so much
[38:29.070 --> 38:35.030]  good. Like here locally, a huge chunk of the money we collect goes towards scholarships
[38:35.550 --> 38:37.310]  where any kid can get.
[38:38.310 --> 38:41.710]  Um, it's a couple of thousand, I think it's 4,000 now.
[38:42.110 --> 38:47.150]  Any kid, local kid that graduates high school in Pueblo can apply for a scholarship and
[38:47.150 --> 38:51.670]  get like four grand as long as they go to one of the local colleges and we're opening
[38:51.670 --> 38:54.150]  it up so that it can be any college in the U.S.
[38:54.950 --> 38:56.910]  Um, I wish they would've done that originally.
[38:56.910 --> 39:00.910]  More kids wouldn't have been able to benefit, but, uh, it took a minute for the
[39:00.910 --> 39:04.150]  program to really get up and running and really get funded.
[39:04.710 --> 39:11.310]  But now they're giving away almost, I think, 700,000 a year in scholarships.
[39:11.350 --> 39:13.070]  And that's for a community like Pueblo.
[39:13.110 --> 39:14.110]  That's huge.
[39:14.150 --> 39:14.350]  Yeah.
[39:15.190 --> 39:21.030]  Um, we had a couple of middle schools down here where they didn't have sidewalks.
[39:21.670 --> 39:27.510]  And so it was just like a road where the cars drive and then field.
[39:28.310 --> 39:33.670]  And there's houses and it's kind of in the middle of a semi-suburban area.
[39:34.350 --> 39:38.150]  But they hadn't gotten around to having the money to pave the sidewalks yet.
[39:38.710 --> 39:44.670]  And so in a very real way, kids were walking in the street with bus and car traffic to
[39:44.670 --> 39:45.670]  get to school every day.
[39:45.710 --> 39:50.270]  The kids that walked and rode their bike had to do so on the same road as the buses and
[39:50.270 --> 39:52.310]  shit. Super unsafe.
[39:52.910 --> 39:57.710]  But it's all we could afford until we legalized pot and we had some extra revenue
[39:57.710 --> 40:01.430]  laying around that wasn't already earmarked for some desperate need.
[40:02.150 --> 40:05.030]  And now those schools have nice safe sidewalks.
[40:05.510 --> 40:06.510]  That's awesome.
[40:06.990 --> 40:09.430]  A couple of parks got refurbished and it doesn't.
[40:09.830 --> 40:11.030]  It's like, ooh, a park.
[40:11.590 --> 40:13.790]  But like for the people who use that, that's huge.
[40:14.110 --> 40:15.750]  Yeah. Like I've got a two and a five year old.
[40:16.070 --> 40:20.270]  The little park up the street that I drove by and never considered for 35 years.
[40:20.710 --> 40:22.510]  That bitch is vital now.
[40:23.910 --> 40:26.270]  Vital like sunshine and water.
[40:26.270 --> 40:27.150]  Vital. Yeah.
[40:27.190 --> 40:28.190]  Oh yeah.
[40:28.830 --> 40:32.550]  And marijuana taxes can pay to keep that up and keep the equipment decent.
[40:33.150 --> 40:39.510]  It's the way that you can use that money is really big because it's it's brand new
[40:39.510 --> 40:42.190]  money. It's not money that's already allocated.
[40:42.190 --> 40:44.430]  You don't have to take it from Jeff to give it to Mike.
[40:45.030 --> 40:49.390]  It's brand new money coming into the flow that you can allocate anywhere you want.
[40:49.430 --> 40:51.070]  And then there's a bunch of ancillary money.
[40:51.110 --> 40:54.790]  Like not only is there sales tax, but you and I have a job.
[40:54.950 --> 40:57.950]  Like how many people work in the cannabis industry in our town?
[40:58.190 --> 40:59.670]  All of those people are now employed.
[40:59.710 --> 41:00.870]  They're now buy dinner.
[41:01.110 --> 41:02.150]  They now buy groceries.
[41:02.190 --> 41:04.070]  They now buy from the dispensary.
[41:04.310 --> 41:05.190]  They're able to do shit.
[41:05.190 --> 41:06.190]  It makes the economy move.
[41:06.190 --> 41:07.470]  1,400 people in Pueblo.
[41:07.470 --> 41:09.270]  Like it's a shitload of jobs.
[41:09.310 --> 41:09.590]  Yeah.
[41:11.150 --> 41:13.470]  It's a massive amount of investment.
[41:14.710 --> 41:17.230]  When when an area goes legal.
[41:19.390 --> 41:23.710]  In Pueblo here, I think it was 50 some million in investment that first year, the
[41:23.710 --> 41:24.550]  2013.
[41:25.350 --> 41:30.510]  Fifty two million, I think, was the number in just one year in economic investment
[41:30.510 --> 41:36.910]  down here. So what that meant for the electricians and the HVAC tax and the dry
[41:36.910 --> 41:41.510]  well crews and the roofing crews, all those guys.
[41:42.990 --> 41:47.790]  I mean, 2012 wasn't exactly an economic boom time.
[41:47.830 --> 41:48.990]  It was 2013.
[41:49.390 --> 41:54.350]  And so this money flowing into Colorado honestly saved a lot of small contract
[41:54.390 --> 41:56.870]  businesses. It turned our town around.
[41:56.870 --> 41:59.430]  It made Trinidad, Colorado, a different town.
[41:59.590 --> 42:02.390]  That place used to be dusty and barely existing.
[42:02.390 --> 42:04.150]  And no disrespect, it was falling apart.
[42:04.150 --> 42:05.350]  It was old and dying.
[42:05.390 --> 42:08.270]  There's a ton of reports on exactly that.
[42:09.710 --> 42:13.910]  This time, you can just Google what marijuana legal pot did to Trinidad,
[42:13.910 --> 42:15.070]  Colorado. Yeah.
[42:15.310 --> 42:22.830]  There's at least one really good interview with their sheriff where he states, I
[42:22.830 --> 42:23.950]  didn't like the idea.
[42:25.430 --> 42:31.550]  I was kind of against it, but my hand was forced and it's revitalized the town.
[42:33.230 --> 42:37.830]  Places that went from like an annual budget of a couple of thousand have a budget of
[42:37.830 --> 42:39.030]  a couple of million now.
[42:41.550 --> 42:46.510]  What's the little pocket above Colorado Springs, the one with only two shop, two
[42:46.510 --> 42:48.750]  stores in it? Manitou Springs.
[42:48.750 --> 42:56.590]  Yeah. Is this little gem in Colorado where it was like locals, it was the cool spot to
[42:56.590 --> 42:59.190]  take your date when you were 25 in Colorado.
[42:59.270 --> 43:01.150]  It's a little hippie spot, a little mountain hippie town.
[43:02.350 --> 43:07.710]  Wonderful food, great scene, great place to hang out in the spring and fall, but
[43:08.150 --> 43:14.550]  super duper poor, falling apart, crumbling, hadn't seen reinvestment or a tax wind
[43:14.550 --> 43:17.190]  falling 30 years, 50 years, some shit.
[43:18.190 --> 43:23.190]  There are two marijuana stores that they allow and the taxes they bring in have paved
[43:23.190 --> 43:24.550]  like most of the streets.
[43:25.510 --> 43:27.510]  It's really, really cool to see.
[43:28.030 --> 43:32.750]  And the crazy thing is, is this is all business that's already happening.
[43:33.350 --> 43:36.310]  It's not business that we have to invent.
[43:36.310 --> 43:41.030]  It's just we're moving it from a black, untaxed and unregulated market into a legal
[43:41.030 --> 43:45.430]  one. And man, you can do so much good with that money.
[43:46.150 --> 43:47.150]  This town is better.
[43:47.190 --> 43:49.390]  This town wasn't a super shitty town.
[43:49.390 --> 43:52.150]  It was kind of on the verge of like, is it going to make it or is it going to fall
[43:52.150 --> 43:57.710]  apart? And when cannabis came, people, like I said, all those 13, 1400 people, they got
[43:57.710 --> 44:01.750]  jobs. But not only did they get jobs, but there are owners and investors that show up
[44:01.750 --> 44:05.950]  in their BMWs and Porsches that come here and they want to eat here and they don't
[44:05.950 --> 44:08.630]  want to eat at all the old and no offense, the old restaurants that were here.
[44:08.630 --> 44:10.790]  I'm not going to list them. I was going to bash some of them, but they don't want to
[44:10.790 --> 44:11.670]  eat at those places.
[44:11.910 --> 44:13.070]  They want the fancy shit.
[44:13.070 --> 44:16.030]  So now the Riverwalk area has got all kinds of new fancy restaurants.
[44:16.270 --> 44:19.630]  Now, the North End of town where we go shopping has all kinds of new cool places
[44:19.630 --> 44:23.470]  because the owners and their wives and their kids all want to go shopping and do fancy
[44:23.470 --> 44:25.390]  shit. Some of the owners are ladies, too.
[44:25.390 --> 44:26.910]  I just made it that all of the owners are men.
[44:26.910 --> 44:29.910]  I apologize for that. A lot of them are ladies, but they want to go shopping.
[44:29.910 --> 44:33.550]  They want to get their food. So we're getting more stuff here because of cannabis.
[44:33.750 --> 44:35.310]  Things used to close at like eight o'clock.
[44:35.310 --> 44:36.350]  Now you get till 10 here.
[44:36.430 --> 44:38.670]  I know that's not extravagant, but you get till 10 to get food.
[44:38.670 --> 44:41.950]  Now, this is one of the things that fucked with me so much when I moved here.
[44:41.950 --> 44:43.390]  Everything closed at 730.
[44:43.670 --> 44:48.750]  Yeah, but little by little and legal cannabis has so much to do with this.
[44:49.270 --> 44:51.990]  And it's not like it was a magic bullet.
[44:52.550 --> 44:58.710]  It's Pueblo was on a slow decline and had been for 30 or 40 years since the steel mill
[44:58.710 --> 45:01.670]  went from employing 50000 to employing 5000.
[45:03.670 --> 45:09.550]  Since then, the town's been on a slow decline and legal cannabis were on a slow
[45:09.550 --> 45:13.390]  incline. Now we're slowly working back up every couple of months.
[45:13.910 --> 45:16.030]  Shit gets a tiny bit better.
[45:17.750 --> 45:21.150]  Look, every six months you'll notice, oh, there's a new restaurant.
[45:21.510 --> 45:23.350]  There's a new florist.
[45:23.670 --> 45:24.790]  There's a new dentist office.
[45:24.790 --> 45:27.230]  Yeah, just little by little by little.
[45:27.230 --> 45:31.430]  The whole city's coming back and it's legal cannabis is the lifeblood doing it, man.
[45:31.710 --> 45:33.310]  This is local local talk here.
[45:33.310 --> 45:35.110]  So the locals will love this.
[45:35.430 --> 45:37.230]  I live in Pueblo. Mike and I are in Pueblo.
[45:37.230 --> 45:38.830]  Colorado Springs is the town.
[45:39.550 --> 45:44.430]  Well, it was an hour north of us now since cannabis is happening in south.
[45:44.430 --> 45:45.750]  Forty five minutes north of us.
[45:45.750 --> 45:48.670]  Yeah. Pueblo is moving north and Colorado Springs is moving south.
[45:48.670 --> 45:50.830]  We're going to devour the town in the middle called Fountain.
[45:50.830 --> 45:52.750]  We're just going to eat it up and spit it out pretty soon.
[45:52.750 --> 45:54.030]  We're going to high five and fountain.
[45:54.270 --> 45:56.070]  Yeah, I'll be like, where are you?
[45:56.070 --> 45:57.030]  I'm at the north end of Pueblo.
[45:57.030 --> 46:01.910]  We'll cross drive 20 feet and be in Colorado Springs because cannabis is bringing.
[46:01.910 --> 46:03.150]  It's got the economy going.
[46:03.150 --> 46:05.470]  Yeah, there's a whole new music scene here.
[46:05.470 --> 46:08.590]  Well, in a refurbished music scene here, we got a really cool club
[46:08.830 --> 46:10.550]  that wouldn't be here without the cannabis scene.
[46:10.550 --> 46:12.790]  So, yeah, I think it's brought us a lot of great shit.
[46:12.790 --> 46:15.230]  Economic incline jobs.
[46:15.550 --> 46:18.550]  The people that have jobs in the cannabis industry would be doing
[46:18.950 --> 46:21.630]  that a lot of us would just be doing crime.
[46:21.830 --> 46:24.750]  It's that age bracket, that demographic.
[46:24.750 --> 46:25.430]  Yeah. Yeah.
[46:25.430 --> 46:29.030]  We went from the black market to doing it on a on a time clock,
[46:29.030 --> 46:31.670]  paying taxes, doing it under cameras.
[46:31.670 --> 46:35.470]  It's it's there's no good count on how many people
[46:35.470 --> 46:38.430]  the the black market for cannabis employs.
[46:39.350 --> 46:43.190]  But if you take the numbers I was given earlier, the thirty five to fifty
[46:43.190 --> 46:47.950]  billion dollar range, that's the same size as the cosmetics market in the US.
[46:48.750 --> 46:54.110]  So if you think about all the lipstick and eyeliner and the the rouge
[46:54.110 --> 46:58.830]  and the lip gloss and the fucking shampoo and lotion and all that,
[46:59.590 --> 47:02.710]  and you take all the people it takes to make all those products
[47:02.710 --> 47:07.230]  and to market those products and distribute them and put them on store shelves
[47:07.230 --> 47:09.910]  and to check you out at the register.
[47:09.910 --> 47:14.310]  And there's all that same amount of people, but they're illegal pot growers
[47:14.310 --> 47:19.990]  and dealers and traffickers and movers and smugglers and shippers.
[47:19.990 --> 47:21.190]  And yep.
[47:23.350 --> 47:28.150]  If you want a more entertainment version of
[47:29.830 --> 47:33.390]  like why prohibition is a bad idea, I just saw it's the 10th anniversary
[47:33.390 --> 47:35.430]  of Boardwalk Empire.
[47:35.910 --> 47:41.070]  Fucking fantastic HBO show on alcohol prohibition.
[47:41.310 --> 47:45.550]  We can always count on Mike to wrap it back around to an HBO movie or a series.
[47:47.750 --> 47:49.750]  There's also an oldie, but a goodie.
[47:49.750 --> 47:52.070]  Check out weeds.
[47:52.310 --> 47:55.110]  It's just show way before it's time from Showtime.
[47:55.150 --> 47:57.190]  Weeds gave me a panic attack, dude.
[47:58.190 --> 47:59.910]  I know I said I was going to let you have a lot of.
[47:59.910 --> 48:02.110]  Yeah, I said I was going to give you a lot of space in the show,
[48:02.110 --> 48:04.390]  but I'm going to butt in with this weeds talk.
[48:04.390 --> 48:08.070]  I grew up my adolescent time, my teenage years.
[48:08.070 --> 48:09.510]  I was doing her job.
[48:09.510 --> 48:10.710]  I was doing her hustle.
[48:10.710 --> 48:14.350]  I was buying cheap and selling high, buying in bulk and selling it small
[48:14.350 --> 48:15.790]  and making money.
[48:15.790 --> 48:21.310]  I watched Nancy Botwin make so many fucking day
[48:21.310 --> 48:25.430]  one stupid mistakes that I would I would be yelling at my fucking TV.
[48:25.430 --> 48:26.670]  You're fucking and I did.
[48:26.670 --> 48:29.270]  I would be panicking like the cops are coming, Nancy.
[48:29.470 --> 48:30.670]  Like I did.
[48:30.670 --> 48:32.470]  It's like that show.
[48:32.470 --> 48:34.790]  That lady made me so fucking nervous, dude.
[48:35.390 --> 48:38.310]  It just it's my favorite example when people
[48:38.870 --> 48:42.590]  try to attack legalization in Colorado, because one of the
[48:42.950 --> 48:47.470]  the negative numbers that's gone up a little is the grow busts.
[48:48.710 --> 48:50.910]  Over the last couple of years since legalization,
[48:50.910 --> 48:54.070]  the cops are busting a larger number of grows.
[48:54.670 --> 48:58.710]  But possession and consumption arrests are down by six thousand.
[48:59.270 --> 49:01.830]  And so it's it went up by like one hundred and fifty,
[49:01.830 --> 49:03.390]  but it went down by six thousand.
[49:05.390 --> 49:09.390]  But they talk about growing pot in the house and the trap house
[49:09.390 --> 49:10.670]  like it's a new concept.
[49:10.670 --> 49:12.990]  And it was so common.
[49:12.990 --> 49:15.790]  It was a fucking hit TV show back in 2006.
[49:15.790 --> 49:18.910]  We get a clue from the busts that I have seen.
[49:19.470 --> 49:23.070]  What is it televised or talked about on the news, broadcasted, shared, whatever.
[49:23.270 --> 49:24.630]  There's a word for it that I'm missing.
[49:24.630 --> 49:26.670]  It'll come to me from what I've seen.
[49:26.670 --> 49:29.510]  Most of those are from people who came from other places
[49:29.710 --> 49:32.110]  because they thought, let's go to Colorado weeds legal.
[49:32.110 --> 49:34.750]  They didn't even bother to they didn't read the rule book.
[49:35.510 --> 49:38.150]  They showed up and they hung up lights and fucking planted a bunch of seeds
[49:38.150 --> 49:40.990]  or bought a bunch of clones and got going.
[49:40.990 --> 49:43.990]  Didn't realize the legal doesn't mean I can have fun.
[49:45.150 --> 49:48.910]  They the black market operates, that's how they produce their product,
[49:48.910 --> 49:52.430]  is they they try to grow it somewhere where they don't think anyone
[49:52.430 --> 49:54.110]  will know or care.
[49:54.110 --> 49:58.710]  And I guess in Florida, because a lot of growers, when they first started
[49:58.710 --> 50:02.350]  busting illegal house grows were from Florida, wasn't going to say,
[50:02.470 --> 50:03.470]  but I let you do it.
[50:03.470 --> 50:06.390]  They published down in the papers in the news,
[50:06.390 --> 50:09.390]  how they published Colorado legalized cannabis.
[50:09.390 --> 50:11.590]  But they didn't start stealing my word.
[50:11.950 --> 50:15.630]  Had six months of meetings where everybody in town
[50:15.630 --> 50:18.230]  learned what the rules were going to be first.
[50:18.230 --> 50:20.950]  So they thought they could get away with just renting the place
[50:20.950 --> 50:22.710]  and filling it with plants.
[50:22.710 --> 50:24.990]  Everybody that saw it was like, wait a second.
[50:24.990 --> 50:28.550]  I don't remember no city meeting or no notice saying
[50:28.550 --> 50:30.270]  they were going to put a marijuana business there.
[50:30.270 --> 50:32.510]  I bet that's shady.
[50:32.510 --> 50:34.990]  Just stand like a sore thumb.
[50:34.990 --> 50:36.550]  They did not blend in at all.
[50:38.350 --> 50:42.110]  Just an update, a fire department cost $400 per square foot.
[50:45.430 --> 50:46.710]  I'm glad you checked.
[50:46.710 --> 50:48.710]  I had to check. I was curious.
[50:48.750 --> 50:51.310]  I thought the mill was pretty low for fire department.
[50:51.310 --> 50:53.950]  I think those fire trucks cost like half a mill piece.
[50:53.950 --> 50:56.190]  Yeah. Houses are a mill.
[50:56.190 --> 50:59.190]  So like, yeah, like not this one, but I mean, like, you know,
[50:59.390 --> 51:01.550]  there are a million dollar houses a few blocks from here.
[51:01.550 --> 51:03.350]  So, right. That's way more.
[51:03.350 --> 51:05.350]  Fire department's got technology in there.
[51:05.350 --> 51:06.470]  We're way off track, Mike.
[51:06.470 --> 51:08.510]  I said I was going to keep us out of the fucking woods today,
[51:08.510 --> 51:10.230]  out of the corn maze.
[51:10.230 --> 51:11.110]  Dude, I'm proud of you.
[51:11.110 --> 51:13.550]  You did a good job on your legalization presentation.
[51:13.550 --> 51:16.230]  I'm sure people are going to have a lot of questions for those people.
[51:16.230 --> 51:18.230]  Fire off all the questions you want, folks.
[51:18.230 --> 51:19.350]  Yes.
[51:19.350 --> 51:22.350]  Grow from your heart at Hotmail.com is the best way to send me an email.
[51:22.470 --> 51:24.030]  Contact Mike through the Twitter.
[51:24.030 --> 51:25.230]  Leave comments on YouTube.
[51:25.230 --> 51:26.710]  Michael, go check the YouTube comments.
[51:26.710 --> 51:27.750]  He's got access to that.
[51:27.750 --> 51:30.470]  So, yeah, leave us some feedback. We would love it.
[51:30.750 --> 51:33.630]  I kind of just interrupted you and cut you off while pulling us out of the weeds.
[51:33.790 --> 51:37.030]  Do you have any more some of those Mike's final moments or any shit
[51:37.030 --> 51:39.710]  you want to add to this before I start wrapping up the show?
[51:39.710 --> 51:41.590]  No, just be kind to each other, folks.
[51:44.830 --> 51:46.030]  Study, study, study.
[51:46.030 --> 51:48.630]  If you want to be a cannabis advocate, it's
[51:50.030 --> 51:55.110]  it's nice now that we've gotten rid of a lot of the baggage that came with it.
[51:56.750 --> 52:01.190]  If you take your time and do your homework, you won't have too much of a
[52:01.630 --> 52:05.350]  an uphill battle becoming a cannabis advocate.
[52:06.310 --> 52:10.070]  Know that once you do it, that's sort of your cross for life, though.
[52:10.630 --> 52:12.990]  Yeah, you can't be a preschool teacher.
[52:12.990 --> 52:14.510]  It will always be Googleable.
[52:16.510 --> 52:19.830]  You can Google my full name and the city that I'm in,
[52:19.830 --> 52:23.430]  and it will come up with reports of me and city council.
[52:23.430 --> 52:25.750]  You'll be able to see my picture on the front of the newspaper.
[52:28.190 --> 52:31.670]  One of the very first times I went and spoke at a public meeting,
[52:32.430 --> 52:35.990]  they had me on the very front page of the Chieftain the next morning.
[52:36.030 --> 52:37.750]  Oh, man, how nerve wracking.
[52:37.750 --> 52:41.990]  Yeah, it was just a reminder that the the squeaky wheel gets greased.
[52:43.110 --> 52:45.590]  So I love waking up to text messages and calls like,
[52:45.590 --> 52:46.950]  Gabriel, you're in the paper today.
[52:46.950 --> 52:48.310]  Like, oh, what the fuck did I do?
[52:48.310 --> 52:51.390]  And it's just a picture of me looking blazed as shit at city council.
[52:51.550 --> 52:53.230]  Hey, I'm here, bro.
[52:53.230 --> 52:54.790]  Yeah, they took a picture of me.
[52:54.790 --> 52:56.390]  A lady resigned at city council.
[52:56.390 --> 52:58.870]  She's like, I'd like to announce today that this is my last meeting.
[52:58.870 --> 53:01.230]  I am resigning. I'm stepping down from my position.
[53:01.590 --> 53:04.910]  And a lot of people I didn't I wasn't too involved in city council,
[53:04.910 --> 53:06.910]  but I knew at the time that people hated her.
[53:06.910 --> 53:10.750]  I was like, I've seen posters about basically fuck this lady and she just quit.
[53:10.750 --> 53:13.710]  And so I made this face of like, oh, fuck, she just quit.
[53:13.990 --> 53:16.550]  And they took a picture of me right as I was like, oh, damn,
[53:16.550 --> 53:18.310]  that bitch just quit in front of everybody.
[53:18.310 --> 53:20.790]  And they posted that picture on the fucking newspaper.
[53:20.790 --> 53:23.870]  And I was like, oh, that's a dumb ass picture of me. It's.
[53:25.150 --> 53:28.670]  That whole incident taught me a lot about local politics.
[53:30.590 --> 53:34.830]  One of our local trash companies, and it's not like they're a special business
[53:34.830 --> 53:39.830]  or they had magic resources or a lot of people or employees to pull upon.
[53:40.550 --> 53:43.670]  There was just two or three people that got really pissed about something
[53:44.390 --> 53:47.830]  and spent enough time on Facebook and talking to people in their life
[53:47.830 --> 53:52.710]  to to get 25 or 30 people to show up on a Monday night,
[53:53.270 --> 53:57.630]  like every other Monday night for like seven or eight times.
[53:58.430 --> 54:00.590]  And so it took a couple of months.
[54:00.590 --> 54:03.750]  It took a lot of people showing up over and over and over again.
[54:04.310 --> 54:07.910]  But after two or three months of this group showing up every week
[54:08.150 --> 54:11.150]  or every other week when they met,
[54:11.550 --> 54:14.750]  their message got heard and I think three people resigned.
[54:15.630 --> 54:19.230]  Like it was a major overhaul of city government at that point.
[54:20.590 --> 54:23.430]  In retrospect, I really should have gone for one of the open seats.
[54:24.190 --> 54:26.190]  But I told you,
[54:28.470 --> 54:32.470]  it really taught me that politics is all perception.
[54:33.230 --> 54:37.190]  And if you can get it doesn't take that many.
[54:37.910 --> 54:41.790]  If you can get 15 or 20 or 30 people to show up
[54:42.350 --> 54:46.590]  and if you can all do something the same, you'll really scare the shit out of people.
[54:47.030 --> 54:51.950]  So if you can all wear neon green T-shirts or royal blue T-shirts,
[54:53.030 --> 54:54.510]  they don't even have to say something.
[54:54.510 --> 54:58.470]  You don't even have to take the time to throw a stencil across it and print like
[54:59.310 --> 55:02.910]  we don't like how you haul trash or legalize pot or whatever on them.
[55:02.910 --> 55:06.070]  They can just all be neon green and high.
[55:06.270 --> 55:09.230]  Me and all the people in matching shirts behind me are here to say
[55:09.430 --> 55:13.350]  we should legalize pot and we're going to come back every week and say that until you do.
[55:14.310 --> 55:17.350]  And the first week, everybody's like, sure you are.
[55:17.990 --> 55:20.590]  And the next meeting, everybody's like, oh, they came back.
[55:20.590 --> 55:23.550]  Key. And by the fifth meeting, they're like, fuck.
[55:24.230 --> 55:27.230]  Like what happens if more people start showing up?
[55:27.230 --> 55:30.430]  Is because the news was talking to that guy before the meeting.
[55:31.190 --> 55:36.830]  And, you know, I saw him last after the last meeting on the news, too.
[55:37.310 --> 55:42.550]  All of a sudden, your little group in whatever your issue is, is getting major,
[55:43.390 --> 55:45.790]  major time during the conversation.
[55:46.390 --> 55:49.510]  And that's when shit really changes.
[55:49.510 --> 55:53.310]  Colorado tried to legalize before we got it done and we failed hard.
[55:53.630 --> 55:55.830]  And but we moved the conversation.
[55:56.470 --> 55:59.790]  And now that we are where we are as a country,
[56:00.590 --> 56:05.230]  like you're there, it's if if places like New York and New Jersey
[56:05.230 --> 56:07.150]  can convince their legislators that
[56:08.470 --> 56:13.150]  getting legalization done in one form or another is important.
[56:13.230 --> 56:16.350]  Even if we don't get it perfect, we can always go back and adjust.
[56:16.990 --> 56:20.870]  If we can get movement in one or two more states, we were it's over.
[56:22.510 --> 56:24.350]  We're there. Nice.
[56:24.350 --> 56:25.950]  That's a good spot to start wrapping it up, Michael.
[56:25.950 --> 56:27.430]  Let's leave an opportunity for a part two.
[56:27.430 --> 56:29.350]  This is going to be just about an hour long,
[56:29.350 --> 56:31.150]  which is a perfect podcast for the two of us.
[56:31.150 --> 56:33.110]  They like it when we ramble.
[56:33.110 --> 56:35.190]  Thank you, bro. And good job. You did a wonderful job.
[56:35.190 --> 56:36.870]  There will be plenty of questions.
[56:36.870 --> 56:37.910]  We'll get plenty of feedback.
[56:37.910 --> 56:40.190]  We'll have to do a revision or a part two.
[56:40.910 --> 56:43.710]  Boys and girls, ladies and gentlemen, pimps and hoes, friends and foes,
[56:43.710 --> 56:46.030]  smokers, growers, clone cutters, pollen chuckers,
[56:46.030 --> 56:48.430]  all you bad motherfuckers out there and podcast land.
