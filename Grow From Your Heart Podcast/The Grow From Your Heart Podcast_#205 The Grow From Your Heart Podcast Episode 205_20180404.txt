[00:17.280 --> 00:19.920]  Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis community.
[00:19.920 --> 00:21.620]  It's time for episode number 205
[00:21.620 --> 00:23.400]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:23.400 --> 00:27.260]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.260 --> 00:28.320]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:28.320 --> 00:29.480]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.480 --> 00:31.760]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:31.760 --> 00:33.640]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone
[00:33.640 --> 00:36.240]  who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:36.240 --> 00:39.440]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:39.440 --> 00:41.240]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:41.240 --> 00:43.080]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:43.080 --> 00:45.280]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:45.280 --> 00:46.920]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:47.560 --> 00:49.400]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:49.400 --> 00:51.240]  Big shout out to Kat, Kuh,
[00:51.240 --> 00:53.620]  and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:56.860 --> 00:58.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, he's back.
[00:58.720 --> 01:00.400]  White Mike is across the table from me.
[01:00.400 --> 01:01.560]  What's up, everybody?
[01:01.560 --> 01:02.520]  Thanks for joining me, dude.
[01:02.520 --> 01:03.760]  Yeah, man, it's good to be back.
[01:03.760 --> 01:05.800]  Oh man, you came on just the right night also.
[01:05.800 --> 01:06.640]  Yep.
[01:06.640 --> 01:08.280]  Yeah, are you okay?
[01:08.280 --> 01:09.280]  I'm good.
[01:09.280 --> 01:10.760]  Mike just told me that he was over there
[01:10.760 --> 01:13.240]  contemplating the flavor of colors a moment ago.
[01:13.240 --> 01:15.120]  That sentence was said.
[01:15.120 --> 01:16.120]  That was a real thing.
[01:16.280 --> 01:17.560]  Are you back on Earth now?
[01:17.560 --> 01:18.440]  Mostly.
[01:18.440 --> 01:19.680]  I think you were flying around
[01:19.680 --> 01:22.520]  in your little mental rocket ship for a moment.
[01:22.520 --> 01:23.880]  Circling yourself.
[01:23.880 --> 01:26.680]  Well, maybe 15 minutes before we hit record,
[01:26.680 --> 01:30.280]  I took the biggest dab I've taken in two months.
[01:30.280 --> 01:31.120]  In two months?
[01:31.120 --> 01:32.840]  There was a good tolerance break in there,
[01:32.840 --> 01:37.840]  and there was some pure THCA crystal.
[01:37.880 --> 01:39.560]  I sprinkled over the dab.
[01:39.560 --> 01:40.400]  We're gonna talk about that in just a couple minutes.
[01:40.400 --> 01:42.600]  And it's doing some fun things.
[01:42.600 --> 01:44.400]  Describe the fun things it's doing.
[01:44.440 --> 01:47.080]  Well, right now I seem pretty lucid.
[01:47.080 --> 01:48.160]  I feel pretty lucid.
[01:48.160 --> 01:49.880]  But a minute ago, I was tuned out
[01:49.880 --> 01:51.920]  just contemplating the taste of blue.
[01:51.920 --> 01:53.760]  What does blue taste like?
[01:53.760 --> 01:54.880]  Dr. Pepper, mostly.
[01:54.880 --> 01:55.720]  Dr. Pepper.
[01:55.720 --> 01:57.080]  Blue tastes like Dr. Pepper.
[01:57.080 --> 01:57.920]  Yep.
[01:57.920 --> 01:58.760]  Okay, I'll give you that.
[01:58.760 --> 01:59.760]  I'm not really sure.
[01:59.760 --> 02:00.960]  Blue dye number two,
[02:00.960 --> 02:02.680]  and then my head's just kind of spiraled.
[02:02.680 --> 02:05.520]  And I, yeah, contemplating the taste of color, folks.
[02:05.520 --> 02:06.360]  Ash will do that.
[02:06.360 --> 02:09.280]  I'm glad that you enjoy the flavor of blue.
[02:09.280 --> 02:10.600]  Blue tastes like Dr. Pepper.
[02:10.600 --> 02:12.280]  Is that because there are two Dr. Pepper bottles
[02:12.280 --> 02:13.200]  that are frosty cool?
[02:13.240 --> 02:14.480]  Yep, it's right in front of me.
[02:14.480 --> 02:15.840]  I'm just good in bake, folks,
[02:15.840 --> 02:16.960]  and we're really enjoying it.
[02:16.960 --> 02:19.120]  Does that mean that green tastes like Mountain Dew?
[02:19.120 --> 02:19.960]  Possibly.
[02:19.960 --> 02:20.800]  Okay.
[02:20.800 --> 02:22.000]  I'm pretty sure green tastes like Mountain Dew.
[02:22.000 --> 02:22.840]  Yeah, that's the first thing
[02:22.840 --> 02:24.000]  I would assume green tastes like,
[02:24.000 --> 02:25.480]  is Surge or Mountain Dew.
[02:25.480 --> 02:26.320]  Surge.
[02:26.320 --> 02:28.120]  Oh yeah, if you're from a certain generation,
[02:28.120 --> 02:29.560]  you'll remember Surge.
[02:29.560 --> 02:30.400]  Yeah.
[02:30.400 --> 02:31.280]  Or Green Otter Pops.
[02:31.280 --> 02:32.600]  Green Otter Pops, word.
[02:32.600 --> 02:34.240]  Oh yeah, or anything sour apple.
[02:34.240 --> 02:35.080]  Yep.
[02:35.080 --> 02:37.080]  All right, we're way on a tangent here.
[02:37.080 --> 02:39.600]  Mike just went out and enjoyed the beautiful sounds
[02:39.600 --> 02:41.080]  of a high-speed chase.
[02:41.080 --> 02:43.440]  Yep, that's the sounds of Pueblo people.
[02:43.440 --> 02:46.560]  There's someone on a crotch rocket
[02:46.560 --> 02:49.120]  having a very uncomfortable conversation right about now.
[02:49.120 --> 02:50.600]  No, they probably got away.
[02:50.600 --> 02:51.920]  The sounds that we heard,
[02:51.920 --> 02:52.960]  that I heard here in the house,
[02:52.960 --> 02:54.560]  they got away, they ran.
[02:54.560 --> 02:56.080]  They did not stop for that cop.
[02:56.080 --> 02:57.600]  They are long gone.
[02:57.600 --> 02:59.160]  There were several officers involved
[02:59.160 --> 03:01.880]  from the sounds of things by the time I came back inside.
[03:01.880 --> 03:03.600]  There's a gas station right by my house,
[03:03.600 --> 03:05.080]  and a lot of the guys on the motorcycles
[03:05.080 --> 03:06.520]  like to gather there.
[03:06.520 --> 03:08.760]  And I'm pretty sure one of them was coming
[03:08.760 --> 03:10.800]  or going to there when they got stopped by that cop.
[03:11.520 --> 03:13.200]  As soon as I got outside, maybe 30 seconds later,
[03:13.200 --> 03:15.360]  I heard somebody on a crotch rocket take off
[03:15.360 --> 03:17.000]  a couple streets over.
[03:17.000 --> 03:20.320]  In about 30 seconds into the crotch rocker
[03:20.320 --> 03:22.400]  making a hell of a lot of noise late at night,
[03:22.400 --> 03:26.320]  a cop joined the siren, or the sounds of the evening.
[03:26.320 --> 03:27.760]  And by the time I came back inside,
[03:27.760 --> 03:30.360]  several officers had joined the hunt.
[03:30.360 --> 03:32.080]  Yeah, so somebody's having a bad night
[03:32.080 --> 03:34.440]  or telling a fun story with a lot of adrenaline
[03:34.440 --> 03:36.360]  pumping through them at home right now.
[03:36.360 --> 03:38.960]  Do you think they're gonna go to jail or get a ticket?
[03:39.000 --> 03:42.800]  That depends on so many things that I did not hear.
[03:42.800 --> 03:43.960]  Yep, let's stay out of that.
[03:43.960 --> 03:46.040]  All right, so beautiful high-speed chase.
[03:46.040 --> 03:47.440]  This sounds of Pueblo people.
[03:47.440 --> 03:48.480]  It's Pueblo, Colorado.
[03:48.480 --> 03:49.880]  It's 10 o'clock on a Sunday night.
[03:49.880 --> 03:52.000]  They're out there just revving it up, getting pulled over.
[03:52.000 --> 03:54.040]  Really nice night too.
[03:54.040 --> 03:57.000]  So all sorts of shenanigans going on tonight, I'm sure.
[03:57.000 --> 03:57.960]  All right, there are a couple things
[03:57.960 --> 03:59.440]  that I want to talk about.
[03:59.440 --> 04:00.680]  Let's get to one thing.
[04:00.680 --> 04:02.920]  Mike just told me that he thinks this show
[04:02.920 --> 04:04.720]  is closer to four years old.
[04:05.640 --> 04:07.160]  At least.
[04:07.160 --> 04:08.000]  No way.
[04:08.000 --> 04:10.280]  I was thinking about this a couple days ago
[04:10.280 --> 04:12.200]  listening to the show.
[04:12.200 --> 04:13.680]  My kid's pushing two.
[04:14.680 --> 04:16.960]  The show was going the whole time.
[04:16.960 --> 04:18.560]  My wife was pregnant with the kid.
[04:18.560 --> 04:21.320]  And for a significant amount of time before that,
[04:22.400 --> 04:24.840]  I was going back listening to the old episodes.
[04:24.840 --> 04:26.920]  In one of the first episodes,
[04:26.920 --> 04:29.400]  you and Kev go to a cannabis cup.
[04:29.400 --> 04:30.480]  Yeah.
[04:30.480 --> 04:35.280]  And it had to have been a medical only cup, right?
[04:35.280 --> 04:37.480]  That's how we figure out how old the show is.
[04:37.920 --> 04:38.760]  That's a good question.
[04:38.760 --> 04:39.600]  We figure out which cannabis cup
[04:39.600 --> 04:41.200]  the two of you went to that time.
[04:41.200 --> 04:43.760]  Cause you guys went to a couple of them.
[04:43.760 --> 04:47.160]  And a couple of the first cups they did in Colorado
[04:47.160 --> 04:52.160]  were medical only long before recreational passed in 2014.
[04:52.800 --> 04:53.760]  All right, so check this out.
[04:53.760 --> 04:55.280]  I've got a good way to do this.
[04:55.280 --> 04:56.120]  And it's going to help me out
[04:56.120 --> 04:57.920]  because my computer was tripping just a second ago.
[04:57.920 --> 05:00.220]  I want to make sure we're properly recording here.
[05:00.220 --> 05:01.480]  So at the same time, I'm going to make sure
[05:01.480 --> 05:04.280]  I'm going to go open up iTunes and FileZilla
[05:04.280 --> 05:05.640]  because I've got the original files
[05:05.640 --> 05:06.960]  in iTunes and FileZilla.
[05:07.440 --> 05:09.560]  And I'm going to look, yeah, there are dates on there.
[05:09.560 --> 05:10.380]  They'll say file created.
[05:10.380 --> 05:11.220]  We're going to get official
[05:11.220 --> 05:12.640]  and figure out how old the show is tonight.
[05:12.640 --> 05:13.480]  Yeah.
[05:13.480 --> 05:15.320]  While we're doing it, we're probably going to take a dab.
[05:15.320 --> 05:16.160]  So we'll come back and we're going to cough.
[05:16.160 --> 05:18.360]  More dabs seem like an appropriate idea.
[05:18.360 --> 05:19.200]  I'm back.
[05:19.200 --> 05:20.540]  I was, to tell you the truth,
[05:20.540 --> 05:22.840]  I took some dabs of the same stuff Mike was dabbing.
[05:22.840 --> 05:24.560]  I took a much larger version
[05:24.560 --> 05:26.640]  and I kind of drifted away as well.
[05:26.640 --> 05:28.640]  I had that, oh fuck moment for a minute
[05:28.640 --> 05:30.320]  when you're like, I might be a little more high
[05:30.320 --> 05:32.160]  than I had planned on being for the evening.
[05:32.160 --> 05:35.320]  Right, this might be a really late recording session
[05:35.320 --> 05:36.960]  because we've got to take an hour beforehand
[05:36.960 --> 05:38.840]  to tone it down a little bit.
[05:38.840 --> 05:41.320]  All right, let's put ourselves in another dab coma
[05:41.320 --> 05:43.160]  and let's make sure this file is recording properly
[05:43.160 --> 05:45.720]  because I'm not certain that the first 30 seconds worked.
[05:45.720 --> 05:46.640]  Something was weird.
[05:46.640 --> 05:48.120]  And also we're going to check the born on date
[05:48.120 --> 05:49.120]  of this podcast.
[05:49.120 --> 05:51.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, if everything went well,
[05:51.000 --> 05:52.940]  we'll be right back.
[05:52.940 --> 05:54.800]  Too bad I didn't hit it until right after you said that.
[05:54.800 --> 05:55.640]  Do it again, do it again.
[05:55.640 --> 05:56.460]  And we're back.
[05:56.460 --> 05:57.300]  There you go, we're back.
[05:57.300 --> 05:59.140]  Mike got to bring the show back.
[05:59.140 --> 06:00.460]  Dude, thanks for coming and hanging out.
[06:00.460 --> 06:01.560]  I didn't do that at the start of the show,
[06:01.560 --> 06:03.200]  but thanks for coming and hanging out with us.
[06:03.200 --> 06:05.200]  I was so overwhelmed by you saying
[06:06.040 --> 06:09.120]  that you were sitting there tasting the flavor of colors.
[06:09.120 --> 06:09.960]  That's fucking awesome.
[06:09.960 --> 06:11.640]  Some sentences stop rooms.
[06:11.640 --> 06:13.800]  So yeah, sometimes you shouldn't say some shit out loud,
[06:13.800 --> 06:14.800]  but thanks for joining us.
[06:14.800 --> 06:15.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back.
[06:15.740 --> 06:18.200]  We did the research we were supposed to do.
[06:18.200 --> 06:20.120]  We solved the mystery.
[06:20.120 --> 06:22.000]  The mystery, the magical mystery has been solved.
[06:22.000 --> 06:23.620]  Before we tell you how long the show
[06:23.620 --> 06:24.820]  has actually been going,
[06:26.060 --> 06:28.480]  let's remind people how to stalk you
[06:28.480 --> 06:29.640]  on all of the social media
[06:29.640 --> 06:31.400]  because we skipped that at the start of the show also.
[06:31.400 --> 06:35.800]  You can find me on Twitter at Nemopunk15
[06:35.800 --> 06:38.680]  or on Facebook at Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[06:38.680 --> 06:40.160]  There you go guys, check him out.
[06:40.160 --> 06:42.600]  Find out where that handsome voice is coming from.
[06:43.960 --> 06:45.600]  And also shout out to Jen and Little Davey
[06:45.600 --> 06:47.280]  for letting you come hang out with me for a little while
[06:47.280 --> 06:48.760]  and record a podcast and get-
[06:48.760 --> 06:49.920]  Thanks for holding down the fort.
[06:49.920 --> 06:51.320]  Get way too high.
[06:51.320 --> 06:52.160]  Way too high.
[06:52.160 --> 06:52.980]  Way too high, you should not be.
[06:52.980 --> 06:54.080]  It's really a beautiful thing.
[06:54.080 --> 06:55.480]  Yeah, it was marvel.
[06:55.480 --> 06:56.520]  I think I'm kind of back.
[06:56.520 --> 06:58.720]  We did take a couple of little smaller grounding dabs
[06:58.720 --> 07:01.040]  because we didn't dip them in the THCA.
[07:01.680 --> 07:02.520]  I think it helped out a lot.
[07:02.520 --> 07:03.640]  That THCA, we're gonna talk about it in a minute.
[07:03.640 --> 07:04.480]  We'll talk more about it.
[07:04.480 --> 07:06.120]  It's really something beautiful.
[07:06.120 --> 07:07.640]  It's obviously working still.
[07:07.640 --> 07:08.880]  We pressed pause for a reason.
[07:08.880 --> 07:10.160]  We are back now.
[07:10.160 --> 07:11.320]  If you're gonna check out social media,
[07:11.320 --> 07:12.280]  why not follow me also?
[07:12.280 --> 07:14.920]  You can check me out on, go to Twitter.
[07:14.920 --> 07:16.360]  It's at GFYH Podcast.
[07:16.360 --> 07:18.080]  If you wanna email me, send me an email.
[07:18.080 --> 07:19.920]  GrowFromYourHeartAtHotMail.com.
[07:19.920 --> 07:20.760]  That's what I like.
[07:20.760 --> 07:23.280]  All right, so we went and checked out the file.
[07:23.280 --> 07:27.120]  Episode number one was put into my iTunes folder
[07:27.120 --> 07:29.940]  on March 24th of 2014.
[07:29.940 --> 07:32.300]  Mike had to sit here and count his fingers several times
[07:32.300 --> 07:33.620]  to figure out how old that was.
[07:33.620 --> 07:36.100]  He was trying to include the year 2014 as another year.
[07:36.100 --> 07:37.540]  That starts at zero.
[07:37.540 --> 07:40.380]  So you got 14 is zero, then 15, 16, 17
[07:40.380 --> 07:42.820]  were three years and a little bit of change.
[07:42.820 --> 07:44.180]  I just had to triple check it.
[07:44.180 --> 07:45.540]  I'm really fried.
[07:45.540 --> 07:46.840]  Right here where it says four years,
[07:46.840 --> 07:49.180]  I'm just gonna X that out for you on my paper.
[07:49.180 --> 07:50.020]  Doink, doink.
[07:50.020 --> 07:51.940]  And then I'm gonna write three with a star
[07:51.940 --> 07:52.860]  and circle the star.
[07:52.860 --> 07:53.980]  Happy- Just over three years old.
[07:53.980 --> 07:55.180]  Just over three years.
[07:55.180 --> 07:57.100]  Happy third birthday to the podcast.
[07:58.060 --> 07:59.500]  Dude, three years.
[08:00.020 --> 08:00.860]  Out of those three years, bro,
[08:00.860 --> 08:02.260]  how many podcasts do you think you've been on?
[08:02.260 --> 08:03.720]  How many episodes?
[08:03.720 --> 08:06.340]  You're over 200 total now, so,
[08:06.340 --> 08:09.740]  don't shit, 75 to 125, somewhere in there.
[08:09.740 --> 08:12.140]  That's a good safe range to guess.
[08:12.140 --> 08:13.820]  That's engineer math right there, bro.
[08:13.820 --> 08:15.860]  Just ballparking the fuck out of it.
[08:15.860 --> 08:16.860]  I'd give you that much.
[08:16.860 --> 08:20.300]  I'd say a good 75, maybe 100 episodes, maybe half of them.
[08:20.300 --> 08:21.140]  Quite a few.
[08:21.140 --> 08:22.620]  Because in the beginning I had you here a lot more.
[08:22.620 --> 08:24.540]  Now Mike's schedule fucking is sporadic.
[08:24.540 --> 08:25.860]  Our schedules don't line up.
[08:25.860 --> 08:28.700]  Yeah, your schedule is definitely more sporadic than mine.
[08:28.740 --> 08:30.580]  When you've got a kid that's almost two,
[08:30.580 --> 08:32.620]  you can plan all you fucking want.
[08:33.700 --> 08:36.220]  But every now and then the kid throws up on everything
[08:36.220 --> 08:37.740]  and you don't get to go anywhere for three days.
[08:37.740 --> 08:40.320]  You've got, what is it, 37 dogs?
[08:41.540 --> 08:44.300]  They add up to 37 normal dogs easily,
[08:44.300 --> 08:47.380]  but three Malamutes, so they shed off
[08:47.380 --> 08:49.100]  two smaller dogs a day each.
[08:49.100 --> 08:50.300]  A sweater?
[08:50.300 --> 08:52.860]  It's a lot to keep on top of.
[08:52.860 --> 08:54.620]  Yeah, so when you call Mike, you're like,
[08:54.620 --> 08:56.180]  hey bro, do you wanna go somewhere?
[08:56.180 --> 08:57.300]  And he's like, your car or mine?
[08:57.340 --> 09:00.220]  If you say your car, he's like, I gotta defer.
[09:00.220 --> 09:02.700]  Yeah, it'll be an extra 15 minutes before I'm ready
[09:02.700 --> 09:05.780]  because I have to do a 15 minute process
[09:05.780 --> 09:09.100]  to leave the house without taking most of a dog with me.
[09:09.100 --> 09:10.500]  When I first met you, I didn't know.
[09:10.500 --> 09:12.620]  I was like, defer, what's this guy got going on?
[09:12.620 --> 09:13.980]  But then the first time I went to your house,
[09:13.980 --> 09:16.060]  I was like, oh, there's those three savage wolves
[09:16.060 --> 09:17.820]  in the front yard, now I get it.
[09:17.820 --> 09:18.740]  Thank you to Disney.
[09:18.740 --> 09:22.900]  Everyone in the northern hemisphere is terrified of my dogs.
[09:22.900 --> 09:24.460]  That's good, they're dogs.
[09:24.460 --> 09:25.460]  People should be afraid of them.
[09:25.460 --> 09:26.700]  Yeah, yeah, you live in Pueblo
[09:27.140 --> 09:28.060]  where we just had a high speed,
[09:28.060 --> 09:30.940]  I wanna say a car chase, but it was a damn motorcycle chase.
[09:30.940 --> 09:33.140]  And shit goes on here, so you need scary dogs.
[09:33.140 --> 09:35.980]  We're way off topic, but this podcast is three years old.
[09:35.980 --> 09:37.180]  I just looped it right back around.
[09:37.180 --> 09:38.020]  I don't know where the hell we even went.
[09:38.020 --> 09:40.020]  Three years, happy third birthday podcast.
[09:42.140 --> 09:43.460]  I put my arms up in the air
[09:43.460 --> 09:45.500]  and nobody on the show can see me throw my arms up
[09:45.500 --> 09:48.100]  in the air in celebration like I'm Rocky or some shit.
[09:48.100 --> 09:50.260]  Didn't we talk about recording this on our video
[09:50.260 --> 09:51.300]  and decided not to?
[09:51.300 --> 09:53.300]  No, yeah, I just decided it'd be much easier.
[09:53.300 --> 09:54.540]  Yeah, I've been making videos of the pod.
[09:54.540 --> 09:55.740]  You just said it, dude, video.
[09:55.740 --> 09:57.220]  Yes, I do make videos of the podcast.
[09:57.220 --> 09:58.740]  You guys have only got the first few videos.
[09:58.740 --> 09:59.580]  I keep talking about it.
[09:59.580 --> 10:00.700]  I'm making them, I'm putting them out.
[10:00.700 --> 10:02.140]  They'll be up there, you'll get to see them.
[10:02.140 --> 10:04.420]  You can watch the first 25 right now.
[10:04.420 --> 10:06.780]  They're on YouTube, it takes a lot of effort.
[10:06.780 --> 10:09.060]  It sucks up my computer for the time it takes
[10:09.060 --> 10:10.820]  to make the video plus like three times as long
[10:10.820 --> 10:12.380]  to upload it to YouTube.
[10:12.380 --> 10:13.660]  Yeah, I don't know if you wanted to share this
[10:13.660 --> 10:14.940]  with the listeners, but I'm gonna go ahead
[10:14.940 --> 10:16.260]  and out you a little bit.
[10:16.260 --> 10:17.660]  While we're talking about the show
[10:17.660 --> 10:19.860]  hitting its third birthday, we filled up the MacBook
[10:19.860 --> 10:21.700]  and had to go back and delete a bunch of files
[10:21.700 --> 10:23.780]  so that we could continue to record this show.
[10:23.780 --> 10:25.300]  That was why it was acting funny earlier,
[10:25.860 --> 10:26.820]  ladies and gentlemen, because yes, it was full.
[10:26.820 --> 10:28.020]  I had, well, usually I-
[10:28.020 --> 10:30.300]  It took three years, bro, good pick.
[10:30.300 --> 10:31.980]  Usually I record a bunch of stuff
[10:31.980 --> 10:35.380]  and then I put them up to wherever it is, iTunes.
[10:35.380 --> 10:37.540]  It goes to my iTunes and then I back my iTunes
[10:37.540 --> 10:39.460]  up to my terabyte hard drive here,
[10:39.460 --> 10:42.460]  my little secondary drive, but I just have it deleted
[10:42.460 --> 10:44.580]  like episodes 180 through 200.
[10:44.580 --> 10:45.980]  So the computer was like, bro,
[10:45.980 --> 10:47.460]  you got all these GarageBand files.
[10:47.460 --> 10:48.900]  Some of them are three hours long
[10:48.900 --> 10:52.140]  because of those throwback episodes I do on Thursday.
[10:52.140 --> 10:53.420]  Oh, also I've got a star right here.
[10:53.420 --> 10:55.980]  It says, apologize, Thursday episode was delayed.
[10:55.980 --> 10:56.940]  That shit just came out late.
[10:56.940 --> 10:58.140]  I don't know what happened.
[10:58.140 --> 10:59.500]  Thursday, I was like, where's the episode?
[10:59.500 --> 11:00.340]  It was right there.
[11:00.340 --> 11:01.820]  Stitcher's been messing with a lot of people.
[11:01.820 --> 11:03.660]  It might've been my upload system.
[11:03.660 --> 11:04.500]  It could have been Stitcher.
[11:04.500 --> 11:05.820]  I'm gonna take accountability
[11:05.820 --> 11:06.780]  and say that shit wasn't there.
[11:06.780 --> 11:07.900]  I apologize.
[11:07.900 --> 11:08.740]  It's been fixed.
[11:08.740 --> 11:09.580]  It's there now.
[11:09.580 --> 11:11.460]  There's a Thursday episode that came out Friday morning.
[11:11.460 --> 11:12.300]  That's funny.
[11:12.300 --> 11:14.220]  I assumed it was Stitcher because several podcasts
[11:14.220 --> 11:16.260]  I listened to all came out a day late.
[11:16.260 --> 11:17.260]  There's complete, oh, okay.
[11:17.260 --> 11:18.900]  Well, then maybe that wasn't me.
[11:18.900 --> 11:21.260]  There's one episode that's completely missing from Stitcher.
[11:21.260 --> 11:22.120]  I've emailed them.
[11:22.200 --> 11:23.960]  I'm like, yo, where's my episode?
[11:23.960 --> 11:25.640]  They replied and said they're on it.
[11:25.640 --> 11:27.280]  Apparently they fell off it.
[11:27.280 --> 11:28.960]  I should email them back.
[11:28.960 --> 11:30.800]  I'm just trying to be polite and let them fix it.
[11:30.800 --> 11:32.360]  Usually they're within 48 hours.
[11:32.360 --> 11:34.640]  It's been probably 48 hours since I messaged them.
[11:34.640 --> 11:36.560]  I should get back on them and get their shit together.
[11:36.560 --> 11:38.320]  But I apologize that Thursday episode
[11:38.320 --> 11:40.960]  didn't come out properly like it should have.
[11:41.880 --> 11:45.240]  Holy crap, we're rambling off topic today, bro.
[11:45.240 --> 11:46.280]  I wanna blame it.
[11:46.280 --> 11:47.440]  They like it when we ramble.
[11:47.440 --> 11:50.040]  They like it when we ramble.
[11:50.040 --> 11:51.080]  If you know what we're talking about,
[11:51.200 --> 11:53.040]  I'm gonna blame half our rambles on our friends
[11:53.040 --> 11:55.160]  at Apothecary in Colorado Springs.
[11:55.160 --> 11:56.280]  More than half.
[11:56.280 --> 11:57.960]  99% of my rambles tonight,
[11:57.960 --> 11:59.800]  well, I'm gonna put 1% into that Dr. Pepper.
[11:59.800 --> 12:02.880]  99% of these rambles are brought to you
[12:02.880 --> 12:04.240]  by our friends at Apothecary Extracts.
[12:04.240 --> 12:05.800]  They don't sponsor the show or anything.
[12:05.800 --> 12:07.840]  There's a new dispensary in Colorado Springs
[12:07.840 --> 12:09.640]  at 3049 Delta.
[12:09.640 --> 12:12.440]  It's a medical marijuana only facility.
[12:12.440 --> 12:14.600]  I don't even know if they had flowers in that bitch.
[12:14.600 --> 12:16.840]  I think that is just a hash store.
[12:16.840 --> 12:18.720]  I think it's full on concentrates.
[12:18.720 --> 12:20.960]  It just takes all kinds of drugs.
[12:21.840 --> 12:22.680]  It just takes all kinds to make the world go round
[12:22.680 --> 12:24.960]  and I'm down with an all hash store.
[12:24.960 --> 12:27.440]  It's an amazing, the concentrate selection
[12:27.440 --> 12:29.160]  in that place is impressive.
[12:30.280 --> 12:32.880]  I've got to reach over to my left.
[12:32.880 --> 12:35.120]  So Mike, say something about hash.
[12:35.120 --> 12:36.760]  The selection we've got on the table,
[12:36.760 --> 12:40.240]  people make pretty much all of you cry.
[12:40.240 --> 12:41.600]  It's really a beautiful thing.
[12:41.600 --> 12:42.800]  We're so spoiled here.
[12:42.800 --> 12:43.920]  All right, so we'll start.
[12:43.920 --> 12:45.640]  Get legalization going in your state
[12:45.640 --> 12:46.920]  so that you can enjoy this too.
[12:46.920 --> 12:48.560]  We'll just start with this little pile.
[12:48.560 --> 12:50.080]  The only complaint I have,
[12:50.080 --> 12:51.840]  I am completely satisfied with this,
[12:51.840 --> 12:54.440]  but they label these little envelope packages
[12:54.440 --> 12:55.920]  that it comes in, these childproof packages.
[12:55.920 --> 12:57.240]  These are labeled, but when you take them out,
[12:57.240 --> 12:59.680]  all these glass jars are not labeled.
[12:59.680 --> 13:02.280]  And I've got obviously a backgammon stack here.
[13:02.280 --> 13:03.880]  There are seven or eight of these stacked up.
[13:03.880 --> 13:07.360]  For civilians, that's a mild inconvenience.
[13:07.360 --> 13:11.200]  For you, it presents a significant logistics problem.
[13:11.200 --> 13:12.720]  So I had to write on them with a marker
[13:12.720 --> 13:13.600]  and now it's coming off.
[13:13.600 --> 13:15.800]  This is Stardog.
[13:15.800 --> 13:18.440]  So they've got a few products we're gonna talk about.
[13:18.440 --> 13:21.120]  And I'm not just pitching apothecary products.
[13:21.120 --> 13:23.440]  You guys, if this sounds like an apothecary fucking ad,
[13:23.440 --> 13:24.280]  they don't pay me for this.
[13:24.280 --> 13:26.760]  I went and bought these products with cash out of my pocket.
[13:26.760 --> 13:28.080]  I paid a pretty penny for them.
[13:28.080 --> 13:29.680]  I'm just so fucking excited about it
[13:29.680 --> 13:30.920]  that I wanna share it with you guys.
[13:30.920 --> 13:32.160]  There are a couple of new things in here
[13:32.160 --> 13:33.400]  that I've never purchased before,
[13:33.400 --> 13:35.480]  that Mike's never seen before,
[13:35.480 --> 13:36.760]  that we smoked that's brand new.
[13:36.760 --> 13:37.800]  And I kinda just wanted to share
[13:37.800 --> 13:39.360]  the brand new shit with you guys.
[13:39.360 --> 13:42.080]  The hash market exploded.
[13:42.080 --> 13:44.580]  I mean, I was thinking about this the other night.
[13:44.580 --> 13:48.400]  It wasn't that long ago that hash was bubble hash.
[13:49.240 --> 13:50.160]  Remember when we started smoking dabs
[13:50.160 --> 13:53.080]  and we would get stuff that was as black as my iPhone case
[13:53.080 --> 13:55.120]  and we were like, we got some shatter bro.
[13:55.120 --> 13:56.560]  And we'd heat up this skillet.
[13:56.560 --> 13:57.600]  Yeah, remember the skillet?
[13:57.600 --> 13:59.960]  Heat that fucker up until it glowed bright orange.
[13:59.960 --> 14:01.320]  Is glow the word?
[14:01.320 --> 14:03.520]  Glow is, I think so.
[14:03.520 --> 14:04.360]  But we're gonna use.
[14:04.360 --> 14:05.280]  Yeah, that's glowed it.
[14:05.280 --> 14:07.320]  Glowing in past tense is glowed.
[14:07.320 --> 14:08.480]  Okay, well that bitch glowed.
[14:08.480 --> 14:09.320]  And then we threw.
[14:09.320 --> 14:11.760]  Shout out to my buddy James at the grow.
[14:11.760 --> 14:13.160]  And then we would throw just chunks
[14:13.160 --> 14:15.320]  of this terrible black shatter on it
[14:15.320 --> 14:17.460]  and just smoke it until our lungs would cave in
[14:17.500 --> 14:20.060]  and we'd cough and we'd be so proud of ourselves.
[14:20.060 --> 14:23.780]  Or the little metal brick with the vial on the end
[14:23.780 --> 14:25.700]  with the alcohol hash.
[14:25.700 --> 14:26.540]  Yeah, what was that?
[14:26.540 --> 14:27.360]  The Atmos vape?
[14:27.360 --> 14:28.200]  The Atmos raw?
[14:28.200 --> 14:29.020]  No, that's not the Atmos.
[14:29.020 --> 14:30.140]  What was that thing called?
[14:30.140 --> 14:30.980]  The Eclipse.
[14:30.980 --> 14:33.120]  I don't remember the brand name,
[14:33.120 --> 14:35.160]  but it looked like an aluminum brick
[14:35.160 --> 14:38.180]  with a glass vial that's screwed into one end.
[14:38.180 --> 14:39.180]  That one was the Eclipse
[14:39.180 --> 14:41.020]  and it would make you puke if you hit too hard.
[14:41.020 --> 14:42.940]  You torch the vial lightly
[14:42.940 --> 14:46.100]  and get the hash vaping off the heat of the glass
[14:46.180 --> 14:47.700]  and then just inhale.
[14:47.700 --> 14:49.740]  And that thing hit like a dump truck.
[14:49.740 --> 14:52.380]  Yeah, it was like getting ran over by a truck.
[14:52.380 --> 14:53.220]  Sometimes you get uncomfortably high.
[14:53.220 --> 14:55.260]  It ruined a number of people.
[14:55.260 --> 14:58.460]  Yeah, but I saw somebody throw up off of it.
[14:58.460 --> 14:59.620]  That wasn't that long ago.
[14:59.620 --> 15:03.940]  I mean, if the show started in 2014,
[15:03.940 --> 15:06.340]  that was 2013, 2012.
[15:06.340 --> 15:09.820]  We were at Metamar at that point in time.
[15:09.820 --> 15:11.860]  So that was seven or six or eight years ago,
[15:11.860 --> 15:13.500]  somewhere in that time frame.
[15:13.500 --> 15:16.300]  And now we've gone from smoking black ass oil
[15:16.300 --> 15:17.860]  that looked like my phone to-
[15:17.860 --> 15:20.140]  And that was the best stuff on the market at the time.
[15:20.140 --> 15:21.260]  And we were happy to get it.
[15:21.260 --> 15:23.060]  Yep, we were lucky to find it.
[15:23.060 --> 15:24.360]  And we were heating it so hot.
[15:24.360 --> 15:27.100]  Guys, now we let the nail cool a lot
[15:27.100 --> 15:28.660]  and then you drop the tab on a carb cap.
[15:28.660 --> 15:30.380]  It's so much better on your lungs.
[15:30.380 --> 15:32.220]  You don't feel like you're gonna die every time.
[15:32.220 --> 15:33.620]  Yep.
[15:33.620 --> 15:34.460]  Let me talk about this
[15:34.460 --> 15:35.860]  because I think I rubbed the label off.
[15:35.860 --> 15:37.220]  I don't know what flavor this is anymore
[15:37.220 --> 15:39.140]  because, oh, we're gonna save that one.
[15:39.140 --> 15:40.180]  We'll talk about that one in a minute.
[15:40.180 --> 15:44.860]  So Apothecary has some really cool branding going on.
[15:44.860 --> 15:47.100]  One thing I wanna talk about is their branding.
[15:47.100 --> 15:49.740]  They make a product that they call Ambrosia.
[15:49.740 --> 15:51.420]  And I don't wanna discredit their Ambrosia.
[15:51.420 --> 15:53.420]  Ambrosia is basically live resin.
[15:53.420 --> 15:54.700]  It is just what they're calling it
[15:54.700 --> 15:58.460]  because live resin is technically a marketing term
[15:58.460 --> 15:59.980]  owned by somebody else.
[15:59.980 --> 16:02.420]  Yep, and it should describe
[16:02.420 --> 16:05.140]  a very specific extraction technique.
[16:05.140 --> 16:05.980]  Right.
[16:05.980 --> 16:09.780]  If you put a Whopper and a Big Mac next to each other,
[16:09.780 --> 16:10.980]  they're both pieces of shit.
[16:10.980 --> 16:11.820]  I'm a vegetarian.
[16:11.820 --> 16:13.900]  I'm just using a very easy example.
[16:13.900 --> 16:16.300]  If you put a Whopper and a Big Mac next to each other,
[16:16.300 --> 16:18.460]  those, yes, are both cheeseburgers.
[16:18.460 --> 16:19.860]  That will work.
[16:19.860 --> 16:22.700]  You can say that, but you cannot call the Whopper a Big Mac
[16:22.700 --> 16:24.340]  and you cannot call a Big Mac a Whopper
[16:24.340 --> 16:25.840]  because they are proprietary products.
[16:25.840 --> 16:27.440]  And if you went to the one place and asked for one,
[16:27.440 --> 16:28.780]  they'd tell you to go fuck yourself.
[16:28.780 --> 16:29.620]  Yep.
[16:29.620 --> 16:32.040]  And that's kinda how live resin-
[16:32.040 --> 16:34.340]  You can't even straight get Pepsi products
[16:34.340 --> 16:36.820]  in the place they make Coke in Georgia.
[16:36.820 --> 16:40.820]  So branding is important everywhere.
[16:40.820 --> 16:41.740]  Yes, yes.
[16:41.740 --> 16:42.980]  That's kinda what we're getting at.
[16:42.980 --> 16:44.700]  But the people that made live resin,
[16:44.700 --> 16:45.940]  they called it live resin first,
[16:45.940 --> 16:48.700]  and for a while they tried to keep it their own.
[16:48.700 --> 16:50.520]  People like us saw that fight
[16:50.520 --> 16:53.140]  because it's important to some people in our community.
[16:53.140 --> 16:55.140]  And it's really important to the guy
[16:55.140 --> 16:56.740]  that patented that technique.
[16:56.740 --> 17:00.420]  So they've got a product, they call it Ambrosia,
[17:00.420 --> 17:02.620]  and it's their version of live resin.
[17:02.620 --> 17:03.740]  I had picked out my,
[17:03.740 --> 17:05.260]  or they showed me a few things on the case.
[17:05.260 --> 17:06.200]  They're like, here's what we've got.
[17:06.960 --> 17:08.320]  There's this product, there's this product.
[17:08.320 --> 17:09.840]  And they're going really fast.
[17:09.840 --> 17:10.680]  And I'm trying,
[17:10.680 --> 17:12.040]  because there's a lot of customers in that place that day.
[17:12.040 --> 17:13.880]  It's their brand new, it's their opening over at
[17:13.880 --> 17:15.880]  Apothecary Farms.
[17:15.880 --> 17:17.360]  And I was checking everything out,
[17:17.360 --> 17:18.480]  and I had made my decisions.
[17:18.480 --> 17:20.360]  They go, oh, we just put this in the system.
[17:20.360 --> 17:21.300]  Because they're running out of stuff
[17:21.300 --> 17:23.120]  and checking new stuff into the system.
[17:23.120 --> 17:24.440]  It's gotta go into their computer system
[17:24.440 --> 17:25.280]  before they can sell it.
[17:25.280 --> 17:27.800]  And they go, smell this and see what you think.
[17:27.800 --> 17:30.000]  They got from where I am to you with the jar.
[17:30.000 --> 17:31.760]  And you could probably, you're starting to smell it probably
[17:31.760 --> 17:33.000]  from where you are.
[17:33.000 --> 17:34.840]  And it is so aromatic that I was like,
[17:34.840 --> 17:35.840]  yeah, I'll take a gram of that.
[17:36.480 --> 17:38.160]  I didn't care what it cost, what it was.
[17:38.160 --> 17:40.120]  I was like, put that in my bag, please.
[17:40.120 --> 17:43.040]  I want you to take it home and smoke that right now.
[17:43.040 --> 17:45.640]  This is blue tie ambrosia.
[17:45.640 --> 17:46.480]  And I'm gonna have to put it down
[17:46.480 --> 17:48.640]  because I'm sweating off the fucking label.
[17:49.600 --> 17:51.960]  That's the only flaw in this stuff is the labels,
[17:51.960 --> 17:53.520]  or they're not labeled once you take them out.
[17:53.520 --> 17:56.080]  The packaging on all this stuff is really slick.
[17:56.080 --> 17:57.840]  They've got their own containers
[17:57.840 --> 18:00.640]  that are all labeled up with their logo.
[18:01.560 --> 18:02.680]  Everything looks slick,
[18:02.680 --> 18:05.680]  but when you've got 12 of them laid out on a,
[18:06.520 --> 18:07.360]  on an oil slick pad in front of you,
[18:07.360 --> 18:09.720]  they're all identical and that's kind of an issue.
[18:09.720 --> 18:10.640]  Yeah. For sure.
[18:10.640 --> 18:13.200]  Especially when you dab and you get a little bit sweaty.
[18:13.200 --> 18:15.000]  Because after a couple dabs, my fingers get the,
[18:15.000 --> 18:17.960]  I get butter fingers.
[18:17.960 --> 18:20.400]  This is, so I've got star dog.
[18:20.400 --> 18:21.680]  This is more of the star dog.
[18:21.680 --> 18:24.560]  So I'm gonna, I was gonna try to describe the smell
[18:24.560 --> 18:26.960]  of that blue tie, but it's undescribable.
[18:26.960 --> 18:29.360]  It's really, it's got almost a mentholatum smell,
[18:29.360 --> 18:30.880]  but it's a good thing.
[18:30.880 --> 18:32.480]  It's got a fruity smell to it.
[18:32.480 --> 18:35.120]  And then if you're familiar with the smell of a good haze,
[18:35.560 --> 18:38.800]  it smells like a good haze, which is the tie,
[18:38.800 --> 18:41.320]  the tie weed and that gives it that haze, I would assume.
[18:41.320 --> 18:43.160]  The star dog was really something special.
[18:43.160 --> 18:46.000]  That was part of the dab that ruined me a minute ago.
[18:46.000 --> 18:48.400]  I would call the star dog gas.
[18:48.400 --> 18:50.000]  It just smells like gas.
[18:50.000 --> 18:52.720]  Yep. It's got a very fuely smell to it.
[18:52.720 --> 18:55.960]  And maybe a little bit of like, if you spilled.
[18:55.960 --> 18:57.640]  See, I can smell that one from here too.
[18:57.640 --> 19:01.280]  If you spilled a little bit of diesel fuel on a bag of soil.
[19:02.160 --> 19:03.760]  Okay. I would agree with that.
[19:03.760 --> 19:04.960]  Okay. I like it.
[19:05.800 --> 19:07.560]  If you get some Fox farms in the car and then you got gas,
[19:07.560 --> 19:09.120]  that's what it would smell like right here.
[19:09.120 --> 19:09.960]  All right.
[19:09.960 --> 19:11.880]  Then what else did I get on the live resin side?
[19:11.880 --> 19:14.060]  I think that's what I've got for their Ambrosia products.
[19:14.060 --> 19:15.600]  I've got a couple that I haven't even opened yet
[19:15.600 --> 19:16.840]  that I don't want to start opening.
[19:16.840 --> 19:18.520]  Cause I do this thing where I open them all
[19:18.520 --> 19:19.800]  and take two dabs out of each of them.
[19:19.800 --> 19:21.440]  And then I got a whole bunch of half smoked hash.
[19:21.440 --> 19:22.800]  And then I'm like, I don't know how much hash
[19:22.800 --> 19:24.320]  I even have at that point.
[19:24.320 --> 19:25.400]  That's what I like.
[19:25.400 --> 19:27.000]  What's this we got here.
[19:27.000 --> 19:30.720]  This one is, and I'm just trying to work up
[19:30.720 --> 19:31.600]  to the grand finale.
[19:31.600 --> 19:32.560]  I'm going slow.
[19:32.560 --> 19:33.640]  Oh, strawberry.
[19:33.640 --> 19:34.480]  But now I'm not even going to read that one.
[19:35.000 --> 19:36.240]  I'm strawberry banana.
[19:36.240 --> 19:39.560]  This one over here, this one will make some people drool.
[19:39.560 --> 19:42.120]  Blueberry cheesecake batter.
[19:42.120 --> 19:42.960]  Yeah.
[19:42.960 --> 19:44.480]  You'll smell it as soon as I open it, dude.
[19:44.480 --> 19:47.880]  Oh, you got just changed the smell in the room.
[19:47.880 --> 19:48.720]  Yeah.
[19:48.720 --> 19:53.080]  And it looks like from this angle in that container,
[19:53.080 --> 19:56.120]  it looks like a piece of chewed up white gum
[19:56.120 --> 19:57.600]  is what it looks like from here.
[19:57.600 --> 19:59.800]  Or like if you, if you've ever made chocolate,
[19:59.800 --> 20:01.480]  like toll house chocolate chip cookies
[20:01.480 --> 20:03.680]  before you drop in the chocolate chips,
[20:03.720 --> 20:04.880]  it's almost this color.
[20:04.880 --> 20:05.720]  Yes.
[20:05.720 --> 20:07.240]  The Ben, that's why they're calling it batter.
[20:07.240 --> 20:08.880]  And it smells like, yeah,
[20:08.880 --> 20:11.600]  the consistency kind of looks like a thick cookie batter
[20:11.600 --> 20:13.040]  and it's just smells.
[20:13.040 --> 20:14.080]  Oh, that's amazing.
[20:14.080 --> 20:15.000]  That's turpid Delic.
[20:15.000 --> 20:16.800]  That's some turpid Delic stuff.
[20:16.800 --> 20:18.640]  I haven't opened to this other one that I mentioned.
[20:18.640 --> 20:19.680]  It's making my mouth water.
[20:19.680 --> 20:20.640]  It smells like candy.
[20:20.640 --> 20:21.800]  It is candy.
[20:21.800 --> 20:24.560]  It's very expensive adult candy.
[20:24.560 --> 20:25.400]  Let's see.
[20:25.400 --> 20:26.240]  I'm going to set that one over here.
[20:26.240 --> 20:27.800]  I'm just trying to keep myself a little organized here.
[20:27.800 --> 20:29.080]  The one I haven't opened this one yet.
[20:29.080 --> 20:32.000]  This is, it's called, it's right here.
[20:32.000 --> 20:34.320]  Strawberry banana HCFSE.
[20:34.320 --> 20:36.200]  And I'll talk about HCFSE in just a minute,
[20:36.200 --> 20:37.440]  but strawberry banana,
[20:37.440 --> 20:39.520]  it smells like what you would expect strawberry banana
[20:39.520 --> 20:40.680]  to smell like.
[20:40.680 --> 20:42.880]  This one here we've got is probably,
[20:42.880 --> 20:46.720]  this is mob boss HCFSE.
[20:46.720 --> 20:47.800]  And I'll talk about that in a minute.
[20:47.800 --> 20:48.640]  I keep saying that.
[20:48.640 --> 20:50.520]  And this is some of the star dog HCFSE.
[20:50.520 --> 20:52.080]  I really like this stuff.
[20:53.120 --> 20:54.120]  It's phenomenal.
[20:55.640 --> 20:57.160]  Really nice body height to it too.
[20:57.160 --> 20:58.240]  Not just the head buzz.
[20:58.240 --> 20:59.760]  Yeah. Yeah.
[20:59.760 --> 21:01.080]  I just got a message on Facebook.
[21:01.120 --> 21:03.200]  This is, hey, do you really need to know more information
[21:03.200 --> 21:06.560]  about HTFSE as I was saying that?
[21:06.560 --> 21:07.480]  And it really weirded me out
[21:07.480 --> 21:09.040]  because I saw the letters pop up on my screen.
[21:09.040 --> 21:10.600]  I was like, somebody just read my mind.
[21:10.600 --> 21:11.920]  So I might press pause here in a minute
[21:11.920 --> 21:13.120]  and we'll let that person send me an info.
[21:13.120 --> 21:15.480]  Are we recording or broadcasting?
[21:15.480 --> 21:17.000]  We are mentally broadcasting.
[21:17.000 --> 21:18.440]  This is more of the star dog.
[21:19.440 --> 21:22.120]  So HCFSE, I'm just going to tell everybody
[21:22.120 --> 21:22.960]  what it stands for now.
[21:22.960 --> 21:24.520]  And we'll talk about it again in a second.
[21:24.520 --> 21:28.600]  It is high cannabinoid full spectrum extract.
[21:28.600 --> 21:30.960]  And right now it may be one of my favorite types
[21:31.800 --> 21:33.000]  of concentrates or extracts to smoke on.
[21:33.000 --> 21:34.320]  It's really flavorful.
[21:34.320 --> 21:37.040]  And it gave me a nice, super pleasing high.
[21:37.040 --> 21:38.560]  I don't think you've gotten to try that one yet, Mike
[21:38.560 --> 21:39.640]  but I'll give you some in a minute.
[21:39.640 --> 21:43.200]  And it's easy to work with, which I mean,
[21:43.200 --> 21:44.040]  Oh, you did get some.
[21:44.040 --> 21:45.880]  That matters to some, it doesn't matter to others.
[21:45.880 --> 21:48.040]  So then the grand finale in my shopping spree
[21:48.040 --> 21:53.040]  that I went on was I've got some THCA crystalline.
[21:54.640 --> 21:57.840]  It is just crystallized THCA.
[21:57.840 --> 22:02.040]  It looks almost like salt or sugar in a container.
[22:02.040 --> 22:03.120]  It looks like snow.
[22:03.120 --> 22:05.700]  It looks like heaven in a little glass jar.
[22:05.700 --> 22:09.920]  I gave Mike a dab of the star dog Ambrosia
[22:09.920 --> 22:13.720]  with the little piece of the star dog HCFSE on there.
[22:13.720 --> 22:17.120]  And then I dipped that in a little tiny bit of the THCA.
[22:17.120 --> 22:20.920]  And Mike was over here contemplating the flavor of blue.
[22:20.920 --> 22:23.120]  And he was, you know that gaze that your friends have
[22:23.120 --> 22:25.240]  when you're like, are you staring all the way down
[22:25.240 --> 22:27.200]  the block or are you not even in there?
[22:27.560 --> 22:29.020]  Mike was looking through the walls.
[22:29.020 --> 22:31.680]  Mike was just lost in La La Land.
[22:31.680 --> 22:34.000]  Just, it took me a couple of fun places.
[22:34.000 --> 22:35.440]  It was really nice.
[22:35.440 --> 22:37.800]  And the overall body effect from that
[22:37.800 --> 22:40.400]  all three combined was really nice.
[22:40.400 --> 22:43.240]  The THCA just makes me skyrocket, dude.
[22:43.240 --> 22:45.720]  I used to say that the terpenes make me skyrocket.
[22:45.720 --> 22:47.840]  The THCA does it better.
[22:47.840 --> 22:51.800]  Yeah, it was kind of like the first time you had a Red Bull.
[22:51.800 --> 22:53.040]  Okay.
[22:53.040 --> 22:55.880]  Just the level of pick me up was significantly stronger
[22:55.880 --> 22:57.140]  than I was expecting.
[22:57.980 --> 22:58.980]  The one thing I've noticed with the THCA
[22:58.980 --> 23:00.100]  is there's no limit.
[23:00.100 --> 23:02.900]  I can't, normally if I'm smoking dabs
[23:02.900 --> 23:05.120]  or whatever I'm smoking, I can get to a certain high.
[23:05.120 --> 23:06.940]  I know where, how high I can get.
[23:06.940 --> 23:09.280]  I don't go past whatever number that is.
[23:09.280 --> 23:10.660]  I don't go past there.
[23:10.660 --> 23:14.500]  When I'm smoking the THCA, I can get to another thing
[23:14.500 --> 23:15.860]  that I don't get to.
[23:15.860 --> 23:18.660]  And I think, it's my belief, I'm not a scientist.
[23:18.660 --> 23:20.060]  I'm not a Scientologist.
[23:20.060 --> 23:23.580]  I believe that the other cannabinoids that come along,
[23:23.580 --> 23:25.540]  Mike's trying to laugh off the Scientologist.
[23:25.540 --> 23:27.300]  Scientologist back to back.
[23:27.300 --> 23:29.460]  Yeah, I don't know if that was a stoner stumble
[23:29.460 --> 23:31.380]  or just beautiful and eloquent.
[23:31.380 --> 23:32.620]  I don't do Scientology.
[23:32.620 --> 23:34.100]  I ain't a Scientomologist.
[23:34.100 --> 23:36.140]  You didn't hold the two metal levers
[23:36.140 --> 23:37.900]  and give all your money to Tom Cruise?
[23:37.900 --> 23:39.980]  No, I will not give all my money to my son.
[23:39.980 --> 23:41.300]  Please don't kill me Scientologists.
[23:41.300 --> 23:44.020]  But no, I don't want to buy any real estate.
[23:44.940 --> 23:46.020]  Or a watch tower.
[23:46.020 --> 23:50.740]  I feel like all of the other cannabinoids that come with it
[23:50.740 --> 23:53.100]  and possibly the terpenes and whatever else are involved
[23:53.100 --> 23:54.740]  in smoking a flower or an extract,
[23:54.740 --> 23:57.460]  I feel like some of those create like a funnel
[23:57.460 --> 23:59.620]  for all the cannabinoids to get into my brain.
[23:59.620 --> 24:00.940]  And I think some of it slows it down
[24:00.940 --> 24:02.580]  and allows me to only get what I need
[24:02.580 --> 24:03.980]  or what I can handle at a certain time.
[24:03.980 --> 24:06.260]  And I think the THC A by itself,
[24:06.260 --> 24:07.660]  you're not getting the regulators
[24:07.660 --> 24:08.860]  that would come along with it,
[24:08.860 --> 24:11.260]  whatever, however it would balance itself out
[24:11.260 --> 24:12.100]  as the entourage effect.
[24:12.100 --> 24:15.380]  It's the cleanest form of THC the way,
[24:15.380 --> 24:17.460]  or at least once it hits your head.
[24:17.460 --> 24:20.420]  Yeah, I can get, I personally-
[24:20.420 --> 24:24.060]  And all those other pieces definitely influence the effect.
[24:24.100 --> 24:25.260]  And so stripping those away,
[24:25.260 --> 24:27.180]  you're getting just the THC effect.
[24:27.180 --> 24:29.940]  And it's almost, I can get really high from it.
[24:29.940 --> 24:31.140]  And I smoke a lot.
[24:31.140 --> 24:32.980]  Like you guys, I'm not trying to talk any shit.
[24:32.980 --> 24:33.820]  I'm not trying to brag.
[24:33.820 --> 24:36.100]  I'm not trying to be the champ or anything.
[24:36.100 --> 24:39.060]  I smoke two grams of Chatter every day.
[24:39.060 --> 24:41.700]  And that's a nice amount of hash to smoke.
[24:41.700 --> 24:42.540]  That's a normal day.
[24:42.540 --> 24:43.380]  That's Tuesday.
[24:43.380 --> 24:45.620]  I'll smoke two grams of Chatter on Tuesday.
[24:45.620 --> 24:47.140]  Like no problem.
[24:47.140 --> 24:48.820]  I can smoke this THC A
[24:48.820 --> 24:51.380]  and I can put myself uncomfortably high.
[24:51.380 --> 24:52.500]  So for a new dabber,
[24:52.500 --> 24:54.020]  for somebody that doesn't smoke every day,
[24:54.860 --> 24:55.700]  they could probably get themselves
[24:55.700 --> 24:56.980]  into an uncomfortable position
[24:56.980 --> 24:58.980]  just smoking the THC A by themselves.
[24:58.980 --> 25:00.140]  Well, it's true with a lot of the products
[25:00.140 --> 25:02.500]  that are legal in medical markets.
[25:02.500 --> 25:03.340]  Very true.
[25:03.340 --> 25:04.580]  Most of the edibles.
[25:04.580 --> 25:08.820]  Yeah, I get sucked into weird places online when I'm baked.
[25:08.820 --> 25:11.180]  And I was reading dispensary reviews from a shop
[25:11.180 --> 25:15.020]  that just happens to be near my mom's place on weed maps.
[25:15.020 --> 25:17.060]  And now one of the reviews mentioned,
[25:17.060 --> 25:19.700]  I'm glad the other bud tender said something
[25:19.700 --> 25:21.500]  because I didn't know shit.
[25:21.500 --> 25:23.740]  And the person I was talking to first
[25:24.460 --> 25:26.900]  who just happened to be the first salesperson I talked to
[25:26.900 --> 25:28.860]  was pointing out hash.
[25:29.740 --> 25:32.100]  And I haven't smoked weed in 40 years
[25:32.100 --> 25:33.380]  and it would have ruined me.
[25:33.380 --> 25:34.220]  Oh yeah.
[25:34.220 --> 25:37.340]  And the other bud tender was caught on to my level
[25:37.340 --> 25:39.980]  of inexperience and said something
[25:39.980 --> 25:42.500]  and got me something I did enjoy.
[25:42.500 --> 25:44.240]  And reading that review kind of took me
[25:44.240 --> 25:45.260]  out of my head for a minute.
[25:45.260 --> 25:47.500]  I was like, well, there's a lot of,
[25:47.500 --> 25:49.460]  I would think of them as civilians.
[25:49.460 --> 25:52.020]  Like, I'm not entirely sure why,
[25:52.020 --> 25:55.380]  but just people who aren't used to this level
[25:55.380 --> 25:58.940]  of THC in a product.
[25:58.940 --> 26:02.580]  We've got a friend whose son just got married.
[26:02.580 --> 26:03.900]  I'm not gonna out him on the show
[26:03.900 --> 26:05.900]  because I respect the privacy,
[26:05.900 --> 26:07.580]  but shout out to my friend who just got married
[26:07.580 --> 26:08.540]  to his beautiful wife.
[26:08.540 --> 26:11.800]  They had family come from two ends of the country
[26:11.800 --> 26:13.140]  to meet here in Colorado.
[26:13.140 --> 26:15.460]  And some of them were super excited about smoking.
[26:15.460 --> 26:17.260]  Actually, you and I messaged back and forth
[26:17.260 --> 26:19.360]  about suggestions on ways to improve
[26:19.360 --> 26:20.380]  their smoking experience.
[26:20.380 --> 26:21.780]  You guys, if you're coming to Colorado,
[26:22.540 --> 26:23.660]  the safest thing we've established to do
[26:23.660 --> 26:27.140]  is get yourself an Airbnb and stay there
[26:27.140 --> 26:28.300]  because it's not a hotel.
[26:28.300 --> 26:29.700]  And as long as the people allow you to smoke,
[26:29.700 --> 26:30.540]  you can smoke there.
[26:30.540 --> 26:31.380]  You're not gonna get yourself in trouble.
[26:31.380 --> 26:32.540]  There are a lot of Airbnb places
[26:32.540 --> 26:35.140]  that advertise as smoker-friendly or 420-friendly.
[26:35.140 --> 26:38.420]  But those folks that came from other places,
[26:38.420 --> 26:40.300]  it was like, dude, they were so excited to be here
[26:40.300 --> 26:42.020]  and they would not have known what to do without you.
[26:42.020 --> 26:43.180]  And they look up to you so much.
[26:43.180 --> 26:44.860]  They think that you guys are like the coolest people
[26:44.860 --> 26:46.060]  just because we know what's going on
[26:46.060 --> 26:46.900]  and we know how to do it.
[26:46.900 --> 26:49.320]  And we live the good life, they think.
[26:49.320 --> 26:50.240]  They think that we're over here
[26:50.240 --> 26:51.940]  just having the best time ever.
[26:53.080 --> 26:55.120]  They don't know about the paperwork, bro.
[26:55.120 --> 26:56.880]  You know, when, yeah, I got somebody else
[26:56.880 --> 26:57.720]  that does the paperwork.
[26:57.720 --> 26:59.600]  I handle the grow and I do all the stuff.
[26:59.600 --> 27:01.680]  And then I'm like, hey, you're gonna have to put tags
[27:01.680 --> 27:02.520]  on all these plants.
[27:02.520 --> 27:04.440]  That's the greatest part.
[27:04.440 --> 27:06.800]  That's one of the things is just know
[27:06.800 --> 27:07.840]  what you're getting into.
[27:07.840 --> 27:10.400]  And this THCA crystal is wonderful.
[27:11.360 --> 27:13.340]  Like if I had a lot of money,
[27:13.340 --> 27:15.520]  like if I got a fat bonus next week at work,
[27:15.520 --> 27:17.200]  I would love to go pick up a grab,
[27:17.200 --> 27:19.400]  heat up my banger and just sprinkle it
[27:19.440 --> 27:21.360]  like I was doing parmesan cheese.
[27:21.360 --> 27:24.920]  I did that and that's how I got myself uncomfortably high.
[27:24.920 --> 27:28.720]  But like you and I know how to work that,
[27:28.720 --> 27:30.960]  how to plan for it, how to handle that.
[27:30.960 --> 27:33.040]  Yeah, I'm 20 feet from my bed right now.
[27:33.040 --> 27:35.320]  I gotta go down some stairs and I can pass out face down.
[27:35.320 --> 27:37.320]  My refrigerator is right there.
[27:37.320 --> 27:38.440]  It's just like anything else.
[27:38.440 --> 27:40.400]  You don't wanna put someone with a learner's permit
[27:40.400 --> 27:41.240]  in a Ferrari.
[27:41.240 --> 27:42.080]  Exactly.
[27:42.080 --> 27:43.760]  So this stuff is super potent.
[27:43.760 --> 27:46.440]  You guys, my friend Doug asked me what it tastes like.
[27:46.440 --> 27:48.740]  It honestly, it doesn't have flavor to it.
[27:49.500 --> 27:50.900]  Probably 95 to nine.
[27:50.900 --> 27:55.900]  I don't remember if the sign said 95 or 99.5% THCA.
[27:56.380 --> 27:59.500]  And what is not THC is terpenes.
[27:59.500 --> 28:01.560]  And there's not enough to taste anyway.
[28:01.560 --> 28:02.780]  It's not enough to make a difference.
[28:02.780 --> 28:04.580]  It's just when they do the extraction,
[28:04.580 --> 28:06.700]  there are terps left in it and they don't do it
[28:06.700 --> 28:07.820]  another round to clean it out
[28:07.820 --> 28:09.500]  because that would fuck up the product.
[28:09.500 --> 28:11.620]  I said that it tastes like hot nail.
[28:11.620 --> 28:14.060]  It's the only thing it's ever tasted like to me.
[28:14.060 --> 28:14.900]  Yeah.
[28:14.900 --> 28:17.060]  It tastes like the dab you took 10 minutes ago.
[28:17.060 --> 28:18.360]  I heat the nail a little extra
[28:18.980 --> 28:19.960]  because I feel like I waste it
[28:19.960 --> 28:21.440]  and it doesn't burn properly in the nail.
[28:21.440 --> 28:22.260]  It's a crystal.
[28:22.260 --> 28:23.440]  It's not an oil.
[28:23.440 --> 28:24.960]  Yeah, it's a hard crystal.
[28:24.960 --> 28:25.800]  Yeah.
[28:25.800 --> 28:26.640]  It's like a salt crystal or a sugar crystal.
[28:26.640 --> 28:28.560]  And you can't push it together very much.
[28:28.560 --> 28:31.800]  Yeah, it looks like the bottom of a sand container.
[28:31.800 --> 28:32.640]  I was calling my dad.
[28:32.640 --> 28:33.840]  This stuff's a little hard to work with.
[28:33.840 --> 28:35.260]  I was calling my dad a powdered donut
[28:35.260 --> 28:36.320]  when I rolled my dab in it.
[28:36.320 --> 28:37.640]  Yep.
[28:37.640 --> 28:39.320]  But so you can get super high off the,
[28:39.320 --> 28:41.680]  and I don't know the process of making the THCA
[28:41.680 --> 28:42.520]  at all, you guys.
[28:42.520 --> 28:44.120]  I don't know how that happens.
[28:44.120 --> 28:46.520]  There's a lot of crystal stuff on the market right now
[28:47.360 --> 28:50.160]  that's really potent and really fun.
[28:50.160 --> 28:53.920]  Yeah, the CBD crystallines, the THC crystallines.
[28:53.920 --> 28:55.800]  We're going really far learning how to do this.
[28:55.800 --> 28:58.000]  Crystal tech is really coming up.
[28:58.000 --> 28:59.480]  I want to read this Facebook message
[28:59.480 --> 29:00.800]  that somebody sent me and see
[29:00.800 --> 29:03.720]  if they actually do have some useful information
[29:03.720 --> 29:06.880]  on the high cannabinoid full spectrum extracts.
[29:06.880 --> 29:08.760]  I've got a little bit of information in my phone
[29:08.760 --> 29:11.800]  from the person that actually made the HCFSE
[29:11.800 --> 29:12.640]  that we're gonna smoke.
[29:12.640 --> 29:13.460]  You made the stuff we're talking about.
[29:13.460 --> 29:14.560]  Yeah, but I want to see if this other guy's
[29:14.560 --> 29:15.400]  got more information.
[29:15.400 --> 29:17.800]  Because the one guy was at work and he typed it quickly.
[29:17.800 --> 29:19.320]  So we're just gonna press pause real quickly, guys.
[29:19.320 --> 29:20.400]  I'm gonna do a little bit of research
[29:20.400 --> 29:22.640]  and read this randomly arriving message
[29:22.640 --> 29:23.800]  because it came at just the right time.
[29:23.800 --> 29:24.780]  So it may be fate.
[29:24.780 --> 29:25.620]  We might want to read this.
[29:25.620 --> 29:27.840]  Pause and a dab and we'll be right back with you folks.
[29:27.840 --> 29:29.080]  Exactly what Mike said.
[29:30.160 --> 29:31.880]  Hi, Leeho neighbors, we are back.
[29:31.880 --> 29:33.120]  Thanks for hanging out.
[29:33.120 --> 29:35.840]  That dude on Facebook, I replied to him and he just,
[29:35.840 --> 29:37.240]  he's like, hey, do you really want to know
[29:37.240 --> 29:38.480]  about this stuff?
[29:38.480 --> 29:40.640]  Yeah, and he, you can see a little type bubble coming up
[29:40.640 --> 29:42.620]  and he starts typing, but then it just keeps going away.
[29:42.620 --> 29:44.160]  So we'll let him type.
[29:44.160 --> 29:46.600]  We'll probably read what he says on another episode.
[29:46.600 --> 29:48.720]  I do have plenty of good information
[29:48.720 --> 29:51.060]  from the guy that made the product.
[29:51.060 --> 29:52.300]  Pretty sure his name is Sean.
[29:52.300 --> 29:53.280]  Let's see, I gotta scroll down.
[29:53.280 --> 29:54.320]  I'm bad with names, guys.
[29:54.320 --> 29:55.920]  I apologize.
[29:55.920 --> 29:57.440]  I'm gonna blame it on the head wound.
[29:57.440 --> 29:58.320]  Yes, his name is Sean.
[29:58.320 --> 30:00.040]  See, I fucking remembered.
[30:00.040 --> 30:02.760]  But anyway, I messaged him.
[30:02.760 --> 30:06.220]  I was like, hey, I understand you make this stuff.
[30:06.220 --> 30:07.960]  Do you think you could explain to me a little bit?
[30:07.960 --> 30:10.000]  And he said, so, and I'm just gonna read the message
[30:10.000 --> 30:12.040]  that he sent me and keep in mind,
[30:12.040 --> 30:14.360]  he was at work and he was on the clock.
[30:14.360 --> 30:17.440]  And, well, that's funny.
[30:17.440 --> 30:20.440]  This guy just said, if on the show, don't mention my name.
[30:20.440 --> 30:23.080]  His name is Carlos.
[30:23.080 --> 30:24.080]  We can say this guy's name.
[30:24.080 --> 30:25.720]  The guy that's Facebook messaging me just said,
[30:25.720 --> 30:27.200]  don't say my name.
[30:27.200 --> 30:29.440]  But the text message from the guy that made
[30:29.440 --> 30:33.220]  the high cannabinoid full spectrum extract
[30:33.220 --> 30:34.960]  sent me a message that says this.
[30:34.960 --> 30:37.760]  So the HCFSE just stands for
[30:37.760 --> 30:40.440]  high cannabinoid full spectrum extract.
[30:41.280 --> 30:44.320]  Basically, a part of the process,
[30:44.320 --> 30:48.400]  we cause THCA to precipitate out of the low hydrocarbon
[30:48.400 --> 30:52.680]  cannabinoid terpene solution, causing the THC to crystallize.
[30:52.680 --> 30:56.000]  Depending on the process and time taken to crystallize,
[30:56.000 --> 30:58.680]  you will get a layer of close to pure THCA
[30:58.680 --> 31:01.600]  ranging around 93% or higher,
[31:01.600 --> 31:06.160]  depending on the amount of terpenes in the crystal.
[31:06.160 --> 31:10.180]  So once you achieve full separation and crystallization,
[31:10.920 --> 31:12.060]  you can pour off the terpene layer
[31:12.060 --> 31:14.820]  to get a more terpene rich extract
[31:14.820 --> 31:18.900]  with low 10% or lower,
[31:18.900 --> 31:22.580]  which being referred to as HTFSE.
[31:22.580 --> 31:23.620]  You follow so far?
[31:23.620 --> 31:24.460]  Yeah.
[31:24.460 --> 31:25.660]  So.
[31:25.660 --> 31:27.420]  Which is impressive, because I'm super high,
[31:27.420 --> 31:29.300]  and that was really specific.
[31:29.300 --> 31:34.300]  The HTFSE is high terpene full spectrum extract.
[31:34.340 --> 31:37.740]  So basically, and this was explained to me later
[31:37.740 --> 31:38.580]  by somebody else.
[31:38.580 --> 31:42.620]  They're using the terpenes in the solution
[31:42.620 --> 31:44.860]  as a solvent to dissolve everything else.
[31:44.860 --> 31:47.520]  They may be pulling out fats and lipids.
[31:47.520 --> 31:50.020]  When I asked that, I kinda got shined on it,
[31:50.020 --> 31:51.660]  but they didn't wanna tell me a lot about that.
[31:51.660 --> 31:53.380]  Everybody that I ask questions,
[31:53.380 --> 31:55.020]  they'll only give me so much.
[31:55.020 --> 31:55.860]  But so.
[31:55.860 --> 32:00.260]  I mean, the hash mark is exploding so quickly.
[32:00.260 --> 32:03.700]  People are looking for a method they can lock in
[32:03.700 --> 32:06.620]  as like, this is Billy, this is Billy's method.
[32:06.620 --> 32:07.460]  Yeah, well this guy's getting.
[32:07.460 --> 32:08.540]  He wants to call it this.
[32:09.380 --> 32:10.220]  This guy's getting this nailed down.
[32:10.220 --> 32:11.060]  Yep.
[32:11.060 --> 32:11.880]  So.
[32:11.880 --> 32:13.540]  And they don't necessarily like sharing that info.
[32:13.540 --> 32:16.700]  He's letting shatter stay in a liquid form,
[32:16.700 --> 32:19.060]  or he's letting a hash oil, butane hash oil,
[32:19.060 --> 32:20.020]  stay in a liquid form.
[32:20.020 --> 32:22.760]  I'm assuming that since he said.
[32:23.940 --> 32:26.460]  And all of this is done with a really fancy
[32:26.460 --> 32:28.300]  closed loop system.
[32:28.300 --> 32:29.140]  He says it allows it to.
[32:29.140 --> 32:30.420]  Don't blow yourselves up, people.
[32:30.420 --> 32:33.900]  Allows the THCA to precipitate out of a low hydrocarbon
[32:33.900 --> 32:35.780]  cannabinoid terpene solution.
[32:35.780 --> 32:39.620]  So that makes me think there is a hydrocarbon,
[32:39.620 --> 32:40.900]  which is most likely butane.
[32:40.900 --> 32:42.980]  He could be using a mixed, custom mixed gas,
[32:42.980 --> 32:44.820]  but I'm going to assume it's a butane base.
[32:44.820 --> 32:46.660]  Predominantly butane is what most people use.
[32:46.660 --> 32:49.060]  A cannabinoid terpene solution,
[32:49.060 --> 32:50.460]  which means he's got cannabinoids,
[32:50.460 --> 32:51.900]  which is obviously the THC,
[32:51.900 --> 32:53.900]  and terpenes, which are obviously terps,
[32:53.900 --> 32:55.540]  which tells me since he said it that way,
[32:55.540 --> 32:56.500]  it's been de-waxed.
[32:56.500 --> 32:57.900]  The lipids have been taken out.
[32:57.900 --> 33:00.860]  There's no plant waxes in there.
[33:00.860 --> 33:02.620]  And so all the lipids and all the,
[33:02.620 --> 33:04.380]  all the whatever chemical solvent,
[33:04.380 --> 33:05.580]  butane or whatever they're using,
[33:06.340 --> 33:07.180]  all of that's removed at this point.
[33:07.180 --> 33:09.380]  And now they've got terpenes and cannabinoids.
[33:09.380 --> 33:10.940]  Well, I think they leave the cannabinoids
[33:10.940 --> 33:14.380]  and the terps and the butane in there together.
[33:14.380 --> 33:15.220]  Okay.
[33:15.220 --> 33:16.460]  And they let everything,
[33:16.460 --> 33:17.820]  because then he says,
[33:18.660 --> 33:21.380]  depending on the process and time taken to crystallize,
[33:21.380 --> 33:24.100]  so I think he's letting it slowly evaporate,
[33:24.100 --> 33:25.340]  time taken to let it crystallize,
[33:25.340 --> 33:28.660]  you will get a layer of close to pure THCA,
[33:28.660 --> 33:31.300]  ranging around 90%, 93% or higher,
[33:31.300 --> 33:32.260]  which is what we've got here.
[33:32.260 --> 33:35.060]  This is the 93% Stardog.
[33:35.060 --> 33:37.620]  Depending on the amount of terpenes in the crystal.
[33:37.620 --> 33:39.260]  Once you achieve full separation,
[33:39.260 --> 33:40.100]  this is another message.
[33:40.100 --> 33:42.780]  Once you achieve full separation and crystallization,
[33:42.780 --> 33:44.820]  you can pour off the terpene layer
[33:44.820 --> 33:47.360]  and get a more pure terpene extract with,
[33:47.360 --> 33:49.360]  and then this is where he kind of fucked up on his writing
[33:49.360 --> 33:50.640]  because he was at work,
[33:50.640 --> 33:53.540]  with low, the 10% or lower,
[33:53.540 --> 33:55.580]  with the THC 10% or lower,
[33:55.580 --> 33:56.500]  which is being referred,
[33:56.500 --> 33:58.060]  that took me a couple of readings to figure out
[33:58.060 --> 33:59.580]  that should say THC,
[33:59.580 --> 34:02.500]  with the THC, with low THC, 10% or lower,
[34:02.500 --> 34:05.100]  which is being referred to as the high terpene,
[34:05.100 --> 34:06.180]  full spectrum extract.
[34:06.180 --> 34:07.340]  So when you make this,
[34:07.340 --> 34:09.860]  obviously the THC sinks and crystallizes, right?
[34:09.860 --> 34:11.320]  Because all the solvents in there,
[34:11.320 --> 34:13.840]  the stuff that floats is all the terps,
[34:13.840 --> 34:15.340]  then you let the butane evaporate
[34:15.340 --> 34:16.780]  because it naturally will,
[34:16.780 --> 34:18.900]  and depending on how long you let that happen,
[34:18.900 --> 34:19.980]  so I bet this was a mistake
[34:19.980 --> 34:20.980]  when they figured this shit out.
[34:20.980 --> 34:22.580]  They just left something in the fucking container.
[34:22.580 --> 34:23.420]  Somebody forgot about a batch for too long.
[34:23.420 --> 34:25.100]  Yeah, and made some stuff in the bottom
[34:25.100 --> 34:26.380]  of a machine that got sat somewhere,
[34:26.380 --> 34:27.860]  is what I bet happened.
[34:27.860 --> 34:29.260]  So the terpenes float to the top
[34:29.260 --> 34:30.100]  because they're liquid,
[34:30.100 --> 34:32.160]  the THC crystals sink to the bottom,
[34:33.000 --> 34:35.280]  this is a little crystal that sank to the bottom.
[34:35.280 --> 34:37.280]  Basically, it's got some terps trapped in it
[34:37.280 --> 34:38.560]  and they're not gonna try to get them out
[34:38.560 --> 34:39.840]  because why, leave them in there,
[34:39.840 --> 34:41.040]  it's fucking delicious.
[34:41.040 --> 34:44.520]  It's 93% THC and like 7% terpenes,
[34:44.520 --> 34:45.920]  it's fucking delicious.
[34:45.920 --> 34:47.680]  So basically they've got a column.
[34:47.680 --> 34:50.160]  What I've established is they make an extraction,
[34:50.160 --> 34:51.880]  I don't wanna talk about how they do the extraction,
[34:51.880 --> 34:53.600]  that's not our thing.
[34:53.600 --> 34:55.360]  I'm a grower, I'm a reader and a podcaster,
[34:55.360 --> 34:56.720]  keep me out of the extraction lab.
[34:56.720 --> 34:59.240]  They've got a column that's filled with liquid butane,
[34:59.240 --> 35:04.240]  hash oil, which is the THC and the terpenes,
[35:04.520 --> 35:06.040]  and then the butane,
[35:06.040 --> 35:07.800]  and then they're separating that
[35:07.800 --> 35:08.760]  into three different things.
[35:08.760 --> 35:12.640]  The butane goes away and the crystals sink
[35:12.640 --> 35:13.560]  and the terps float,
[35:13.560 --> 35:14.440]  and then they pour it off
[35:14.440 --> 35:15.720]  and sell you two different products,
[35:15.720 --> 35:17.600]  the high cannabinoid, which is what I've got,
[35:17.600 --> 35:19.800]  and then the high terp they had available.
[35:19.800 --> 35:21.440]  But I wanna get high not smoked terps.
[35:21.440 --> 35:22.700]  I love terps, don't get me wrong,
[35:22.700 --> 35:24.400]  but for my budget that I had to spend there,
[35:24.400 --> 35:25.440]  there were so many good things
[35:25.440 --> 35:27.760]  that the terps were the last on my mind.
[35:27.760 --> 35:28.800]  There were so many other things.
[35:29.640 --> 35:33.120]  That's basically what this person taught me
[35:33.120 --> 35:34.960]  about high terpenes
[35:34.960 --> 35:37.760]  and high cannabinoid full spectrum extract.
[35:37.760 --> 35:39.280]  There's a definite market for stuff
[35:39.280 --> 35:41.200]  that's got a lower THC content
[35:41.200 --> 35:42.760]  and a really high flavor profile.
[35:42.760 --> 35:45.800]  He said, so HCFSE and HTFSE
[35:45.800 --> 35:47.680]  are basically the two parts of the extract
[35:47.680 --> 35:50.560]  separated in the two pure forms.
[35:50.560 --> 35:52.400]  And then he said, does that help at all?
[35:52.400 --> 35:54.680]  I was like, yes.
[35:54.680 --> 35:56.060]  And then he said he has personally spent
[35:56.060 --> 35:58.580]  over 650 hours in the last three months
[35:58.580 --> 36:00.820]  perfecting their Crystal Tech.
[36:00.820 --> 36:02.900]  And then I also asked him about their Ambrosia
[36:02.900 --> 36:04.820]  and he tells me that it was the name of their live resin
[36:04.820 --> 36:06.620]  that he came up with just to set them apart.
[36:06.620 --> 36:09.000]  So big shout out to Sean at Apothecary,
[36:09.000 --> 36:10.380]  big shout out to Woody at Apothecary,
[36:10.380 --> 36:11.660]  big shout out to everybody at Apothecary
[36:11.660 --> 36:13.340]  for hooking me up, taking good care of me
[36:13.340 --> 36:16.260]  and for teaching us about the products that we're smoking.
[36:16.260 --> 36:17.620]  I love the Hash Revolution.
[36:17.620 --> 36:21.440]  This high cannabinoid full spectrum extract,
[36:21.440 --> 36:24.980]  when you smoke it, you get a really good high from it
[36:24.980 --> 36:26.460]  and the taste is amazing.
[36:26.460 --> 36:28.540]  I don't know how they're saying the turps are all gone
[36:28.540 --> 36:30.820]  because it tastes so good still.
[36:30.820 --> 36:33.140]  Well, a big part of that nice clean taste
[36:33.140 --> 36:35.260]  is getting rid of all the crap.
[36:35.260 --> 36:37.500]  The waxes that are gone.
[36:37.500 --> 36:41.820]  I mean, a lot this week I've been vaporizing a lot of Keef.
[36:42.780 --> 36:44.780]  I had an old ball of scissor hash that I stashed
[36:44.780 --> 36:45.980]  and the last time I trimmed.
[36:45.980 --> 36:47.780]  We smoke so differently.
[36:47.780 --> 36:50.380]  Well, it's just I'm purposefully trying
[36:50.380 --> 36:52.140]  to use up product at this point
[36:52.140 --> 36:56.580]  and my grinder's Keef catch has been full for a minute now.
[36:56.580 --> 36:58.480]  So use it or lose it.
[37:00.100 --> 37:04.260]  And the flavor of that is very, very planty.
[37:04.260 --> 37:08.780]  Even though it's a fairly 60%, 50%
[37:08.780 --> 37:12.480]  or better THC extract at that point,
[37:12.480 --> 37:15.060]  it's still very earthy.
[37:15.940 --> 37:18.620]  It's got a very old school hash flavor to it
[37:18.620 --> 37:21.380]  and this stuff just, it's super crisp and clean,
[37:21.380 --> 37:24.020]  really flavorful and you don't get any
[37:24.020 --> 37:29.020]  of that old burnt chlorophyll, that heavy dirt flavor.
[37:29.300 --> 37:31.480]  You still get that good kush earthy flavor
[37:31.480 --> 37:33.780]  but it's not that nasty plant material flavor
[37:33.780 --> 37:36.280]  that old school hash smokers are used to.
[37:37.260 --> 37:38.160]  Some people miss that.
[37:38.160 --> 37:39.980]  I love when the vets go to the dispensary
[37:39.980 --> 37:41.300]  and they're like, you got any of that old shit?
[37:41.300 --> 37:42.580]  This new shit ruins me.
[37:44.820 --> 37:46.620]  The last retail counter I worked,
[37:46.620 --> 37:48.780]  I had a selection of stuff for those people
[37:48.780 --> 37:50.580]  that was like, oh, I know what you want.
[37:50.580 --> 37:53.300]  I have stuff that somebody brought in
[37:53.300 --> 37:56.260]  and just doesn't move until somebody that comes in
[37:56.260 --> 37:58.780]  specifically looking for water hasher.
[37:58.780 --> 38:01.540]  I keep smelling this Stardog high cannabinoid
[38:01.540 --> 38:03.700]  full spectrum extract and it's got me,
[38:03.700 --> 38:05.980]  I'm slightly salivating for a dab of this shit.
[38:05.980 --> 38:07.420]  We're gonna take one here in just a minute.
[38:07.420 --> 38:10.740]  Would you agree that that looks like Parmesan cheese?
[38:10.740 --> 38:11.900]  It's a little yellower.
[38:11.900 --> 38:13.580]  Okay, a little yellower for Parmesan,
[38:13.580 --> 38:16.020]  maybe oilier Parmesan cheese?
[38:16.020 --> 38:18.980]  Yeah, starting to melt over your food Parmesan.
[38:18.980 --> 38:20.900]  Yeah, I don't know how else to describe it, you guys.
[38:20.900 --> 38:22.740]  It's a really neat color, a really neat texture.
[38:22.740 --> 38:24.300]  It's slightly crystallized,
[38:24.300 --> 38:26.740]  but when you touch it, it'll melt into itself.
[38:26.740 --> 38:29.380]  It's a bitch to take a dab of, that's the only problem.
[38:29.380 --> 38:32.060]  I've been taking Shatter and putting Shatter on the dabber
[38:32.060 --> 38:34.300]  and using it as a mop to just mop up some.
[38:34.300 --> 38:37.700]  It works very well that way and it helps me to conserve it.
[38:37.700 --> 38:39.780]  You have to get inventive using some of this stuff.
[38:39.780 --> 38:42.260]  I was just looking at the table thinking,
[38:42.260 --> 38:44.700]  this is a nice glass pencil dabber
[38:44.700 --> 38:46.900]  that's really nice and gentle on the bucket.
[38:47.140 --> 38:50.220]  I mean, six months ago,
[38:50.220 --> 38:52.380]  none of the heads of our rigs looked like this.
[38:52.380 --> 38:53.980]  It was all metal, all titanium.
[38:53.980 --> 38:55.140]  Yeah, the past few months,
[38:55.140 --> 38:56.620]  I've switched a little bit to the quartz
[38:56.620 --> 38:57.940]  from the titanium a little bit.
[38:57.940 --> 39:00.940]  The quartz, these are 20 bucks at Elevate for me to replace.
[39:00.940 --> 39:02.980]  Now that we're on the all glass tools,
[39:02.980 --> 39:03.820]  just use them. Those are 40 bucks
[39:03.820 --> 39:04.660]  at Elevate for me to replace.
[39:04.660 --> 39:06.820]  I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
[39:06.820 --> 39:08.620]  Edit, edit, edit.
[39:08.620 --> 39:10.020]  The hash tools we've got,
[39:10.020 --> 39:12.100]  sometimes you gotta get real inventive
[39:13.020 --> 39:14.260]  smoking some of this stuff.
[39:14.260 --> 39:16.460]  Like some of it, I'll heat the dabber up with my fingers.
[39:17.020 --> 39:17.940]  I'll just hold the tip for a few minutes
[39:17.940 --> 39:21.260]  and get it warm enough to get a little melt going on
[39:21.260 --> 39:23.320]  just so it'll hold the product.
[39:23.320 --> 39:26.980]  I've got a special tool that's got a little shovel on it
[39:26.980 --> 39:29.780]  so that I can just scoop in a powdery product.
[39:29.780 --> 39:31.300]  I folded a little card in half
[39:31.300 --> 39:34.100]  and I've been pouring the THC crystalline into the card
[39:34.100 --> 39:35.620]  and then dumping that into the banger
[39:35.620 --> 39:37.460]  and that seems to work best for me.
[39:37.460 --> 39:39.340]  All right, so I got a Facebook reply from a friend.
[39:39.340 --> 39:41.540]  I cannot reveal his identity.
[39:41.540 --> 39:44.100]  If you listen to the podcast, shout out.
[39:44.100 --> 39:46.480]  Let me know what I got wrong about my first rant
[39:46.480 --> 39:48.980]  about the high cannabinoid full spectrum extract.
[39:48.980 --> 39:50.220]  He sent me a little bit.
[39:50.220 --> 39:52.020]  I'm gonna read it slowly and say what I can
[39:52.020 --> 39:54.460]  because there's parts he says, don't say this.
[39:54.460 --> 39:56.340]  He also says, if on the show, don't say my name.
[39:56.340 --> 39:57.920]  So I won't.
[39:57.920 --> 40:02.140]  He says, the separation happens once in a jar in the oven.
[40:02.140 --> 40:04.260]  So this is how I learned how to extract BHO.
[40:04.260 --> 40:06.820]  I would, and guys, don't fucking do this.
[40:07.980 --> 40:09.300]  How can I say this like safely
[40:09.300 --> 40:10.500]  to let you know how to do it?
[40:10.500 --> 40:13.300]  I would extract directly from a tube into a Mason jar.
[40:14.500 --> 40:16.180]  Because I liked the Mason jar
[40:16.180 --> 40:18.220]  because nothing could fall into it.
[40:18.220 --> 40:20.580]  It was better than doing it into a Pyrex dish.
[40:20.580 --> 40:22.540]  The Mason jar has less.
[40:22.540 --> 40:24.140]  Cleaner but more shrapnel-y.
[40:25.060 --> 40:26.700]  Well, if shit's going wrong, it's going wrong.
[40:26.700 --> 40:28.620]  That was my fucking view of life at that point.
[40:28.620 --> 40:30.300]  If it blows, you want the shrapnel
[40:30.300 --> 40:31.860]  so that you don't have to live to the explosion.
[40:31.860 --> 40:32.700]  That's what I'm hearing.
[40:32.700 --> 40:34.860]  Maybe that's a sick fuck that I am.
[40:34.860 --> 40:36.580]  Hey, you let me blow my shins off if I want.
[40:36.580 --> 40:38.340]  If I wanna walk around no damn shins like Cotton Hill,
[40:38.340 --> 40:39.180]  I can do that.
[40:40.980 --> 40:41.820]  So.
[40:41.820 --> 40:43.060]  I'm trying not to go on a rant.
[40:43.060 --> 40:44.180]  I know, I see you turning purple
[40:44.180 --> 40:45.020]  and trying to hold it back,
[40:45.020 --> 40:46.020]  but this is in the past.
[40:46.020 --> 40:47.420]  I used to make BHO.
[40:47.420 --> 40:48.660]  My friend taught me how to do it.
[40:48.660 --> 40:49.500]  I did it in the backyard.
[40:49.500 --> 40:50.540]  I did it into a Mason jar.
[40:50.540 --> 40:51.660]  It worked really well for me.
[40:51.660 --> 40:52.820]  Then I would take that Mason jar
[40:52.820 --> 40:54.580]  and pour it into a parchment paper
[40:54.580 --> 40:57.140]  and start to vac purge it on the parchment paper.
[40:57.140 --> 40:59.020]  So this guy says,
[40:59.020 --> 41:01.300]  the separation happens once the jar is in the oven.
[41:01.300 --> 41:02.620]  So he just probably runs,
[41:02.620 --> 41:04.900]  I'm assuming you run your solution.
[41:05.940 --> 41:08.580]  Then he says, you run the closed loop system like normal
[41:08.580 --> 41:11.100]  if you're planning to do a heavy butane pour.
[41:11.100 --> 41:13.900]  Instead of pouring the parchment into a thin layer,
[41:13.900 --> 41:16.540]  you pour into something deep like a Mason jar.
[41:16.540 --> 41:18.140]  So I used to go straight into the Mason jar.
[41:18.140 --> 41:20.340]  So I was almost doing this shit on accident.
[41:21.180 --> 41:23.500]  That's why I say this probably happened on accident.
[41:23.500 --> 41:26.220]  Somebody probably blasted it into a jar and left it there
[41:26.220 --> 41:27.300]  and it fucking separated.
[41:27.300 --> 41:28.940]  They're like, oh, that shit at the bottom is fire.
[41:28.940 --> 41:30.220]  That shit at the top is turpy.
[41:30.220 --> 41:31.420]  Oh, wow.
[41:31.420 --> 41:32.580]  That's whoever, yeah.
[41:32.580 --> 41:33.820]  I wanna know how this happened, you guys.
[41:33.820 --> 41:35.580]  If you're involved in the creation of this
[41:35.580 --> 41:36.420]  and I'm gonna tag the people
[41:36.420 --> 41:38.140]  that I've been messaging in this episode,
[41:38.140 --> 41:39.500]  I may have to send it to people privately
[41:39.540 --> 41:41.460]  because I can't message this dude publicly.
[41:41.460 --> 41:43.060]  But I wanna know if this was on purpose or not.
[41:43.060 --> 41:44.340]  I wanna know how this came about.
[41:44.340 --> 41:47.940]  But so do it like you're gonna do a heavy butane pour
[41:47.940 --> 41:49.340]  instead of pouring onto parchment paper
[41:49.340 --> 41:50.580]  because normally you'd pour into parchment,
[41:50.580 --> 41:51.580]  it would go into a flat layer,
[41:51.580 --> 41:54.580]  then you'd slide those trays into the back oven, right?
[41:54.580 --> 41:56.500]  Instead, we're going into a Mason jar.
[41:57.460 --> 41:58.980]  There are many ways from here.
[41:59.980 --> 42:04.140]  I set until crystallization begins good.
[42:04.140 --> 42:06.380]  So he just lets it sit there, it sounds like.
[42:07.220 --> 42:08.980]  Pour it into a Mason jar.
[42:09.380 --> 42:11.740]  Crystallization, then low heat vac
[42:11.740 --> 42:13.460]  until I'm basically done.
[42:13.460 --> 42:15.020]  Short high vac at the end.
[42:15.020 --> 42:16.500]  Can't go into more detail.
[42:17.620 --> 42:19.260]  You basically filled in the questions
[42:19.260 --> 42:20.780]  with all the detail I fished out
[42:20.780 --> 42:22.980]  from three or four people and a quick Google search.
[42:22.980 --> 42:24.820]  I think I understand the process.
[42:24.820 --> 42:27.980]  If I had a closed loop system, I could put it together.
[42:27.980 --> 42:30.180]  Right, all we need is 60 grand, the system,
[42:30.180 --> 42:32.460]  and a couple of tanks of butane and we're good to go.
[42:32.460 --> 42:34.620]  Yeah, I think the closed loop system we would need
[42:34.620 --> 42:37.060]  is only about 20,000 bucks, I think.
[42:37.060 --> 42:38.540]  Oh, you just put it on the black card.
[42:39.540 --> 42:40.380]  Don't talk about that.
[42:40.380 --> 42:41.220]  Or the red, gold, and green card.
[42:41.220 --> 42:43.420]  The red, gold, and green Rasta credit card?
[42:43.420 --> 42:44.260]  That's not a thing.
[42:44.260 --> 42:45.140]  The lion will buy it.
[42:45.140 --> 42:46.820]  The Lion of Judah Babylon card?
[42:48.060 --> 42:48.900]  But, no, I think.
[42:48.900 --> 42:50.300]  It's off a truck card, we're in Pueblo.
[42:50.300 --> 42:51.620]  Our buddy Barefoot's got a closed loop.
[42:51.620 --> 42:53.420]  I'm pretty sure he didn't throw it on 20 G's for it.
[42:53.420 --> 42:55.420]  Barefoot, come on the show, let's talk about
[42:55.420 --> 42:57.740]  high cannabinoid full spectrum extracts
[42:57.740 --> 42:58.660]  because I know you know how to do it.
[42:58.660 --> 42:59.740]  Come on the show, let's talk about it.
[42:59.740 --> 43:00.900]  He's just hard to get ahold of lately
[43:00.900 --> 43:02.540]  because he's a popular motherfucker.
[43:02.540 --> 43:03.860]  It's that time of year, man.
[43:03.860 --> 43:06.140]  If you want to get with somebody in the cannabis industry,
[43:06.140 --> 43:07.740]  call in like November.
[43:08.940 --> 43:11.220]  No, because in November they're harvesting.
[43:11.220 --> 43:12.500]  Harvest should be over by then.
[43:12.500 --> 43:14.540]  You gotta call in December, right after Christmas.
[43:14.540 --> 43:16.020]  Right after they spend all their Christmas money
[43:16.020 --> 43:17.260]  on all their kids, you gotta call and be like,
[43:17.260 --> 43:18.100]  I got a job for you.
[43:18.100 --> 43:19.380]  The hustle starts again.
[43:19.380 --> 43:20.940]  So I'm gonna have to give this dude a shout out
[43:20.940 --> 43:22.780]  because he really filled in some pieces.
[43:22.780 --> 43:25.100]  So you run your closed loop system normally,
[43:25.100 --> 43:26.100]  like you normally would,
[43:26.100 --> 43:27.580]  and then you pour it into a mason jar
[43:27.580 --> 43:29.220]  and then it'll begin separating itself
[43:29.220 --> 43:31.500]  and then you purge it lightly.
[43:32.820 --> 43:35.260]  That makes it, it sounds almost easier
[43:35.260 --> 43:37.220]  than making old school BHO.
[43:39.180 --> 43:41.660]  It requires some interesting steps.
[43:41.660 --> 43:44.500]  Do you remember when the boys were starting to learn
[43:44.500 --> 43:45.780]  how to make BHO around here
[43:45.780 --> 43:48.220]  and I was giving them material to let them figure it out
[43:48.220 --> 43:50.500]  and I kept telling them, don't touch it.
[43:50.500 --> 43:52.780]  After that step right there, don't touch it.
[43:52.780 --> 43:55.060]  And little Kev kept going, but I have to.
[43:55.060 --> 43:55.900]  What do I do then?
[43:55.900 --> 43:57.620]  I said, don't touch it, leave it alone.
[43:57.620 --> 43:59.340]  Like go play video games for a couple of days.
[43:59.340 --> 44:00.900]  Come over here and dab.
[44:00.900 --> 44:02.620]  Leave it there, come over here and take dabs with me
[44:02.620 --> 44:05.020]  for like four hours and then go home and check on it.
[44:05.020 --> 44:05.860]  If he would have done that,
[44:05.860 --> 44:08.300]  we would end up making this extract on accident
[44:09.260 --> 44:11.980]  but I understand why he had to go.
[44:11.980 --> 44:13.580]  It's like me, when I water my plants,
[44:13.580 --> 44:14.940]  I'm gonna go look at them and see what they're doing.
[44:14.940 --> 44:17.220]  He had to go home and fuck with his hash.
[44:17.220 --> 44:19.140]  Folks, I really can't stress enough
[44:19.140 --> 44:21.740]  how much you don't wanna make hash at home.
[44:21.740 --> 44:22.580]  It's illegal.
[44:22.580 --> 44:25.340]  Wherever you are making extracts, concentrates,
[44:25.340 --> 44:26.460]  I call it contracts.
[44:27.820 --> 44:29.980]  Anywhere in the United States,
[44:29.980 --> 44:33.220]  emptying butane into a closed space,
[44:33.220 --> 44:35.980]  like a house is illegal.
[44:35.980 --> 44:36.820]  Even out on-
[44:36.820 --> 44:38.100]  Because it's making a bomb.
[44:38.860 --> 44:41.460]  Even out on private land, improperly-
[44:41.460 --> 44:44.780]  The cannabis community has eaten a lot of shit
[44:44.780 --> 44:48.540]  over the last month and a half over optics.
[44:48.540 --> 44:51.380]  Stuff that really, it's not the whole community's fault.
[44:51.380 --> 44:54.100]  We all didn't get together and fuck up the same way.
[44:54.100 --> 44:56.720]  But every time somebody's apartment blows up,
[44:58.300 --> 44:59.940]  we all take two steps back
[44:59.940 --> 45:02.460]  and there's been a lot of that since 420, man.
[45:02.460 --> 45:04.900]  We all look like dipshits when shit goes wrong.
[45:04.900 --> 45:07.420]  So please, if you're doing extracts,
[45:07.420 --> 45:09.740]  be extremely careful.
[45:09.740 --> 45:10.940]  Don't do this shit at home, people.
[45:10.940 --> 45:12.260]  Leave this up to professionals.
[45:12.260 --> 45:14.540]  And that's a good way to do a shout out right here.
[45:14.540 --> 45:17.820]  If you are trying to find some high cannabinoid,
[45:17.820 --> 45:19.220]  full spectrum extract,
[45:19.220 --> 45:22.380]  I highly recommend that you go to visit my friends
[45:22.380 --> 45:25.100]  at Apothecary Farms at 3049 Delta
[45:25.100 --> 45:26.900]  in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[45:26.900 --> 45:28.060]  It's really easy to get to.
[45:28.060 --> 45:29.300]  It's really easy to park.
[45:29.300 --> 45:30.260]  There's parking.
[45:30.260 --> 45:31.980]  Fucking, I parked three feet from the door.
[45:31.980 --> 45:33.860]  I could see inside the store when I parked.
[45:33.860 --> 45:35.420]  It was super simple.
[45:35.420 --> 45:37.700]  It's a medical marijuana facility only.
[45:37.700 --> 45:40.100]  So you're gonna need a medical marijuana card.
[45:40.100 --> 45:41.580]  Medical marijuana program.
[45:41.580 --> 45:42.420]  That's right.
[45:42.420 --> 45:44.340]  It's worth going to get the card.
[45:44.340 --> 45:45.180]  It's fucking awesome.
[45:45.180 --> 45:47.620]  I've got my appointment lined up with the doc
[45:47.620 --> 45:48.780]  to go get my card renewed.
[45:48.780 --> 45:50.860]  Oh shit, I gotta do that again now, huh?
[45:50.860 --> 45:52.900]  Yeah, if I'm doing it, you're probably about due.
[45:52.900 --> 45:54.300]  Yep, I'm just doing this.
[45:54.300 --> 45:55.780]  I just had the same thing with my badge.
[45:55.780 --> 45:57.420]  It was like, oh, it's new badge week.
[45:57.420 --> 45:58.580]  Oh shit, when is my badge?
[45:58.580 --> 45:59.500]  Okay, I'm gonna have to look and see
[45:59.500 --> 46:02.100]  when my MED badge expires.
[46:02.100 --> 46:03.500]  Everything's come and due all at once.
[46:03.500 --> 46:04.340]  Time to reach into the wallet.
[46:04.500 --> 46:05.420]  That time of year, bro.
[46:05.420 --> 46:07.100]  You guys would think that Colorado's awesome.
[46:07.100 --> 46:09.860]  It's fucking expensive to be this awesome.
[46:09.860 --> 46:11.020]  It takes a lot of work, man.
[46:11.020 --> 46:13.580]  People think it's all fun and games, but.
[46:13.580 --> 46:14.980]  This little town that we live in,
[46:14.980 --> 46:16.860]  the price of rent has tripled
[46:16.860 --> 46:18.740]  at some places in the past two years.
[46:18.740 --> 46:20.380]  I was watching this funny thing,
[46:20.380 --> 46:22.500]  a Facebook group I follow.
[46:22.500 --> 46:26.140]  A whole area of people where the anti-pot group
[46:26.140 --> 46:29.420]  in Pueblo West is particularly vicious.
[46:29.420 --> 46:31.140]  Their home values spiked this year
[46:31.140 --> 46:32.580]  and they're freaking out trying to figure out
[46:32.580 --> 46:35.740]  if it's legit or if somebody's fucking with them
[46:35.740 --> 46:36.980]  because they're getting letters saying
[46:36.980 --> 46:39.300]  that your house is worth significantly more this year
[46:39.300 --> 46:42.060]  than it was last year and they're freaking out.
[46:42.060 --> 46:44.820]  And that's, the housing market here
[46:44.820 --> 46:47.180]  has dried up completely from everybody moving here.
[46:47.180 --> 46:48.740]  Yeah, there are jobs here.
[46:48.740 --> 46:51.580]  Everybody wants to come here and consume marijuana safely.
[46:51.580 --> 46:54.220]  They wanna come here and treat their ailments safely
[46:54.220 --> 46:55.060]  and they wanna come here.
[46:55.060 --> 46:57.500]  A lot of people come here just to work in the industry.
[46:57.500 --> 46:58.540]  We've got a trim crew.
[46:58.540 --> 46:59.700]  We hire an outside trim crew.
[46:59.700 --> 47:02.340]  Hey, shout out to all my friends at Green Mountain Harvest.
[47:03.060 --> 47:04.620]  I said the other day, they're just trimmers.
[47:04.620 --> 47:05.460]  Fucking love you guys.
[47:05.460 --> 47:06.660]  Come trim all the time.
[47:06.660 --> 47:07.780]  I love having you guys in the grill.
[47:07.780 --> 47:08.940]  You're fucking cool.
[47:08.940 --> 47:11.260]  They always bring somewhere between six to 10 people
[47:11.260 --> 47:12.740]  with them, they're guys and gals.
[47:12.740 --> 47:14.460]  Every one of them is fucking awesome, the people that come.
[47:14.460 --> 47:16.780]  I have a lot of fun hanging out with those guys.
[47:16.780 --> 47:18.660]  Put me back on track, remind me where the fuck I was.
[47:18.660 --> 47:20.220]  Oh, a lot of those kids are from Florida.
[47:20.220 --> 47:21.980]  There's a whole group of them that are best friends
[47:21.980 --> 47:23.060]  that live together.
[47:23.060 --> 47:25.300]  Shout out to Sam and Drew and all you crazy fuckers
[47:25.300 --> 47:27.100]  and your blow up dolls.
[47:27.100 --> 47:29.180]  It's an inside joke, kind of.
[47:29.180 --> 47:30.260]  They're all, they're from Florida
[47:30.260 --> 47:31.740]  and they're all cool as fuck, but they came here
[47:32.140 --> 47:32.980]  and they all work for a trim crew
[47:32.980 --> 47:34.300]  and they're great fucking kids,
[47:34.300 --> 47:35.860]  but they're here for cannabis
[47:35.860 --> 47:37.620]  because they can freely consume cannabis
[47:37.620 --> 47:39.500]  without being harassed here.
[47:39.500 --> 47:41.140]  I mean, all over the state of Colorado
[47:41.140 --> 47:43.580]  and pretty much every state that's legalized it
[47:43.580 --> 47:45.580]  is seeing this.
[47:45.580 --> 47:47.700]  People are sick of living under prohibition.
[47:47.700 --> 47:48.860]  There's no point to it.
[47:48.860 --> 47:51.460]  It's expensive, it's costly, it's a headache.
[47:51.460 --> 47:54.260]  Why not live somewhere where you can just swing by
[47:54.260 --> 47:57.260]  a dispensary, pick up some of the best cannabis products
[47:57.260 --> 48:00.940]  on the planet, everything's lab tested, everything's clean.
[48:00.940 --> 48:04.180]  Sold you in a sealed package that weighs properly.
[48:04.180 --> 48:05.180]  Yep.
[48:05.180 --> 48:06.580]  The ingredients are printed on the back
[48:06.580 --> 48:08.300]  of this hash container.
[48:08.300 --> 48:10.740]  I was watching, I was channel surfing the other night
[48:10.740 --> 48:13.420]  and it was Weed-A-Kit.
[48:13.420 --> 48:14.260]  Yes.
[48:14.260 --> 48:16.080]  And they were talking about, the episode was on
[48:16.080 --> 48:20.300]  smuggling weed from California to New York or some shit.
[48:20.300 --> 48:22.460]  And during the interview with law enforcement,
[48:22.460 --> 48:25.260]  they're fucking with a dude in a Winnebago
[48:25.260 --> 48:26.820]  and they dig all through the Winnebago
[48:26.820 --> 48:28.740]  because the dog alerted.
[48:28.740 --> 48:31.340]  And what they end up finding is an empty baggie
[48:31.340 --> 48:33.860]  that had some weed in it and a scale that had some weed
[48:33.860 --> 48:34.820]  on it.
[48:34.820 --> 48:38.700]  And the cop goes, why else would you have a digital scale?
[48:38.700 --> 48:41.860]  Every cannabis smoker I know has one so they can make sure
[48:41.860 --> 48:43.700]  their dealer ain't fucking them.
[48:43.700 --> 48:45.780]  You don't need that in a legal state.
[48:45.780 --> 48:50.620]  Like if the guy at the dispensary is shorting your bottle,
[48:50.620 --> 48:53.040]  the shop's gonna know, the dude's gonna get fired,
[48:53.040 --> 48:54.380]  no one's gonna go there.
[48:54.380 --> 48:55.660]  So it doesn't happen ever.
[48:55.660 --> 48:56.500]  Yeah.
[48:56.780 --> 48:59.060]  Those scales are checked by the Department of Ag.
[48:59.060 --> 49:01.140]  Yeah, the shop scales are,
[49:01.140 --> 49:03.900]  like they're insanely expensive scales
[49:03.900 --> 49:05.500]  that are certified quarterly.
[49:05.500 --> 49:08.340]  There's a camera, when you're at the dispensary
[49:08.340 --> 49:10.740]  and the bud tender is putting your buds into a container
[49:10.740 --> 49:14.020]  on the scale, there's a camera directly above the scale
[49:14.020 --> 49:15.980]  that shows the numbers on the scale
[49:15.980 --> 49:17.900]  and that bud tender's hands to make sure
[49:17.900 --> 49:19.740]  that everything goes the way it should.
[49:19.740 --> 49:20.900]  And then right next to the cash,
[49:20.900 --> 49:23.180]  right above the cash register is a very similar thing.
[49:23.180 --> 49:24.980]  So they see how many grams go on the scale
[49:24.980 --> 49:27.420]  and they see how much money goes in the cash register.
[49:27.420 --> 49:31.100]  Like every time, there are more cameras at a dispensary
[49:31.100 --> 49:33.820]  than on any movie fucking set I have ever thought
[49:33.820 --> 49:34.660]  of going to.
[49:34.660 --> 49:37.740]  It's a lot like being on a casino floor in Vegas.
[49:37.740 --> 49:39.060]  Very similar.
[49:39.060 --> 49:42.180]  When the dice are bouncing across the craps table,
[49:42.180 --> 49:45.140]  the guy in the security room can see the numbers
[49:45.140 --> 49:47.500]  rolling across the top of the dice, the camera's so clean.
[49:47.500 --> 49:48.340]  I can see.
[49:48.340 --> 49:49.860]  Like they can see dirt under your fingernails.
[49:49.860 --> 49:51.900]  I can see the VIN number on my vehicle
[49:51.900 --> 49:54.340]  outside in the parking lot while I'm in the office.
[49:54.700 --> 49:56.460]  I can zoom the camera on the light pole outside
[49:56.460 --> 49:57.420]  down that close.
[49:58.860 --> 50:03.860]  There's really no point in shopping on the black market
[50:04.200 --> 50:06.960]  in Colorado unless you're trying to save a couple bucks.
[50:08.280 --> 50:10.240]  Or if you're just scared or lazy.
[50:12.100 --> 50:13.660]  I mean, unless you're trying to circumvent
[50:13.660 --> 50:15.620]  some specific dispensary rule.
[50:15.620 --> 50:19.220]  But like, there's just no point.
[50:19.220 --> 50:20.060]  There's why people are driving.
[50:20.060 --> 50:21.060]  Why are you gonna run my ID?
[50:21.060 --> 50:22.500]  Because they take your ID twice
[50:22.500 --> 50:23.720]  at an inappropriate dispensary.
[50:24.160 --> 50:25.520]  They check your ID two times and I've seen people,
[50:25.520 --> 50:26.520]  why do you need to see it twice?
[50:26.520 --> 50:27.720]  I showed it to the guy up front.
[50:27.720 --> 50:29.200]  And they're like, well yeah, but I'm the cash register.
[50:29.200 --> 50:30.240]  I wanna see your fucking ID.
[50:30.240 --> 50:31.600]  I'm the one selling it to you.
[50:31.600 --> 50:33.160]  It's my job on the line.
[50:33.160 --> 50:34.400]  Give me your ID or get out.
[50:34.400 --> 50:36.920]  I'm taking money, you're getting weed from me.
[50:36.920 --> 50:38.400]  I need to make sure you're who you say you are
[50:38.400 --> 50:40.200]  and you're old enough for this purchase.
[50:40.200 --> 50:42.520]  And people, some people, weird old people,
[50:42.520 --> 50:44.240]  it's usually, and I'm sorry to say,
[50:44.240 --> 50:46.360]  it's an old veteran that's afraid to be in a system
[50:46.360 --> 50:47.720]  or run their ID or something.
[50:47.720 --> 50:49.600]  Well, that's, I mean, especially with cannabis,
[50:49.600 --> 50:54.120]  we've spent a huge, I mean, trillions of dollars,
[50:54.120 --> 50:57.260]  millions of man hours hunting people down
[50:57.260 --> 50:59.800]  because they had a joint in their pocket,
[50:59.800 --> 51:02.640]  ruining people's lives because they peed dirty.
[51:02.640 --> 51:04.160]  Yeah.
[51:04.160 --> 51:05.760]  I mean, how many people in this country
[51:05.760 --> 51:09.040]  still go to work every day with random drug tests
[51:09.040 --> 51:12.080]  being a thing where because you smoked a joint
[51:12.080 --> 51:15.180]  at the concert that came through two weeks ago,
[51:17.120 --> 51:19.000]  you end up pissing dirty at work
[51:19.000 --> 51:21.080]  and now you don't have your job anymore
[51:21.080 --> 51:23.460]  and that whole industry's sort of off limits
[51:23.460 --> 51:25.760]  for a little while because you just got fired
[51:25.760 --> 51:27.800]  from whatever job because you peed dirty.
[51:27.800 --> 51:29.760]  It's not like you showed up to work intoxicated.
[51:29.760 --> 51:31.680]  It's not like you were high at work and fell asleep
[51:31.680 --> 51:33.680]  or fucked something up or hurt somebody.
[51:33.680 --> 51:35.760]  You just went to a concert, had a good time
[51:35.760 --> 51:38.000]  as a responsible adult, went home,
[51:38.000 --> 51:40.600]  peed dirty two weeks later, now you're fucked.
[51:40.600 --> 51:43.440]  Like now your kids are, you know,
[51:43.440 --> 51:46.560]  going to your wife because the child custody hearing
[51:46.560 --> 51:48.400]  went against you because she told the judge
[51:48.400 --> 51:49.240]  you smoked weed.
[51:49.240 --> 51:52.240]  Oh, you're depressing some of our listeners right now.
[51:52.240 --> 51:53.680]  There's so many ways that we went after people
[51:53.680 --> 51:57.040]  because the thing we couldn't do is get people
[51:57.040 --> 51:59.480]  to turn each other in for buying and selling weed
[51:59.480 --> 52:00.320]  with each other.
[52:01.520 --> 52:02.360]  That doesn't work.
[52:02.360 --> 52:04.040]  So we had to come up with a million other ways
[52:04.040 --> 52:06.420]  to scare people away from it or to ruin your life
[52:06.420 --> 52:09.580]  because of it and a lot of that shit's still in place,
[52:09.580 --> 52:10.760]  even in Colorado.
[52:10.760 --> 52:12.440]  And so there's, I mean, there's definitely people
[52:12.440 --> 52:14.120]  that are paranoid about going to a shop
[52:14.120 --> 52:16.440]  and getting their name on a list.
[52:16.440 --> 52:18.340]  I know plenty of people that qualify
[52:18.340 --> 52:20.360]  for our medical program that don't have cards
[52:20.360 --> 52:21.200]  because of that.
[52:21.200 --> 52:24.680]  You can't, I've got, I work with a lot of HVAC technicians
[52:24.680 --> 52:26.700]  and electricians and stuff that come into the grow
[52:26.700 --> 52:28.840]  and they're like, man, I would love to just smoke
[52:28.840 --> 52:31.120]  one doobie of all this shit that I get to see
[52:31.120 --> 52:32.800]  and they're like, I haven't smoked in 10 years
[52:32.800 --> 52:35.200]  because of my profession, I'd lose my job.
[52:35.200 --> 52:36.040]  Yep.
[52:36.040 --> 52:37.600]  And then one guy told me, he's like,
[52:37.600 --> 52:40.120]  weed really helps my wife, she loves to eat edibles.
[52:40.120 --> 52:42.440]  She likes those CBD gummies and they change her life.
[52:42.440 --> 52:44.800]  They make her pain free and she can sleep.
[52:44.800 --> 52:45.840]  And I was like, well, go to the store
[52:46.200 --> 52:47.040]  and get her some edibles, bro.
[52:47.040 --> 52:48.120]  Her dispensary is right up there.
[52:48.120 --> 52:50.640]  Like I gave him directions and he goes, she can't go in.
[52:50.640 --> 52:52.320]  And I was like, well, get her her cardigan.
[52:52.320 --> 52:54.040]  He's like, she can't because then she can't have
[52:54.040 --> 52:56.440]  her concealing carry permit and we live out on a farm
[52:56.440 --> 52:58.120]  and she's always got a gun in her purse.
[52:58.120 --> 52:58.960]  Yep.
[52:58.960 --> 52:59.880]  And I was like, damn, that sucks.
[52:59.880 --> 53:03.880]  I was talking to someone at, it was a big dinner event
[53:03.880 --> 53:05.760]  the other night that I was at with like,
[53:05.760 --> 53:08.720]  you know, weird people, fancy people in town,
[53:08.720 --> 53:10.160]  like County Commissioners and shit were there.
[53:10.160 --> 53:11.200]  I had to wear a suit.
[53:12.480 --> 53:14.600]  And hey, you're the weed guy comes up every time
[53:14.600 --> 53:16.160]  and I go to one of those things.
[53:16.160 --> 53:20.560]  And one of the people at my table says, I'd love to go.
[53:20.560 --> 53:23.360]  I'm super interested in to see what it looks like
[53:23.360 --> 53:26.160]  and what legalization looks like.
[53:26.160 --> 53:27.560]  And I'm kind of looking at her funny
[53:27.560 --> 53:29.800]  because I'm like, you're an adult, you live in Colorado.
[53:29.800 --> 53:32.200]  Why didn't you just drive to a store and check it out?
[53:32.200 --> 53:33.880]  And she goes, I'm a teacher, it's too risky.
[53:33.880 --> 53:36.520]  I won't go to one anywhere in the state.
[53:37.520 --> 53:42.000]  Just on the off chance that someone who recognizes
[53:42.000 --> 53:44.760]  this person as a teacher is like, oh my God,
[53:44.760 --> 53:45.760]  there's so and so teacher.
[53:45.760 --> 53:47.200]  They won't go to up in Boulder.
[53:47.200 --> 53:49.200]  That person was at the dispensary too.
[53:49.200 --> 53:50.040]  Yeah.
[53:50.040 --> 53:51.240]  If they saw you there, they were there also.
[53:51.240 --> 53:54.480]  Maybe you guys can go burn one together and fucking relax.
[53:54.480 --> 53:55.320]  But there's plenty of that.
[53:55.320 --> 53:57.800]  I had plenty of customers at the spot
[53:57.800 --> 53:59.100]  that would come in and go,
[54:01.280 --> 54:04.360]  I've been working for the railroad or the, you know,
[54:04.360 --> 54:07.840]  whatever oil company for 25 years, 32 years.
[54:07.840 --> 54:09.640]  I retired on Friday.
[54:09.680 --> 54:10.960]  We drove all night.
[54:10.960 --> 54:12.360]  We're here.
[54:12.360 --> 54:14.860]  Like, I want to smoke weed for the first time
[54:14.860 --> 54:16.920]  since I got this job.
[54:16.920 --> 54:19.120]  And it's like, you've really wanted to smoke a joint
[54:19.120 --> 54:22.140]  for 30 years and didn't because you worked for the railroad.
[54:22.140 --> 54:23.080]  Like I'm impressed.
[54:23.080 --> 54:24.480]  Here's some weed.
[54:24.480 --> 54:25.320]  Enjoy yourself.
[54:25.320 --> 54:26.360]  You're going to be too high.
[54:26.360 --> 54:27.760]  But there's plenty of that.
[54:28.680 --> 54:29.520]  And so I get it.
[54:29.520 --> 54:33.080]  But like, once you get to enjoy legalization,
[54:33.080 --> 54:33.960]  I don't want to go back.
[54:33.960 --> 54:35.840]  I don't like leaving Colorado now.
[54:35.840 --> 54:37.400]  I just took a gigantic dab.
[54:37.400 --> 54:38.240]  You really did.
[54:38.240 --> 54:41.200]  Some star dog, high HCFSE.
[54:41.200 --> 54:43.280]  And it's a, yeah, go for it.
[54:43.280 --> 54:44.240]  I'm just going to take a little dab off
[54:44.240 --> 54:45.080]  what's left in the room.
[54:45.080 --> 54:46.080]  Yeah, there's a little smoke left in there.
[54:46.080 --> 54:46.920]  You'll get a taster.
[54:46.920 --> 54:48.640]  It made me, I feel purple.
[54:49.560 --> 54:51.520]  So your phrase earlier about taste purple.
[54:51.520 --> 54:52.360]  I feel purple.
[54:52.360 --> 54:54.360]  I'm a little warm and yeah.
[54:54.360 --> 54:55.640]  Woo.
[54:55.640 --> 54:58.040]  I feel all Barney like, I guess.
[54:58.040 --> 55:00.480]  So you want to put this podcast back on some rails?
[55:00.480 --> 55:01.320]  No.
[55:01.320 --> 55:03.240]  All right, let's keep talking about random shit though.
[55:03.240 --> 55:04.080]  Let's go for it.
[55:04.080 --> 55:04.900]  What's next?
[55:04.900 --> 55:05.740]  I like stickers.
[55:05.740 --> 55:06.560]  Do you like stickers?
[55:06.560 --> 55:07.400]  Stickers are good.
[55:08.080 --> 55:09.800]  In a few, on the 420 episode,
[55:09.800 --> 55:13.040]  I asked what people like to smoke,
[55:13.040 --> 55:13.880]  what they like to eat,
[55:13.880 --> 55:14.920]  what they like to listen to.
[55:14.920 --> 55:16.640]  I tried to be a little interactive with my audience
[55:16.640 --> 55:18.880]  because I feel like we're friends.
[55:18.880 --> 55:19.880]  The other day, somebody sent me,
[55:19.880 --> 55:21.200]  this is just a side note in my head.
[55:21.200 --> 55:23.000]  The other day, somebody sent me an Instagram message,
[55:23.000 --> 55:24.120]  thanking me for what I do,
[55:24.120 --> 55:26.200]  telling me that they were kind of having a shitty day
[55:26.200 --> 55:28.680]  and I kind of brightened them up with a specific episode.
[55:28.680 --> 55:30.520]  And I have a feeling it was a stay positive episode
[55:30.520 --> 55:33.160]  because I get a lot of response from that one.
[55:33.160 --> 55:36.000]  But I'm glad I can cheer you up, whoever you were.
[55:36.000 --> 55:37.280]  I'm not going to call you out
[55:38.160 --> 55:39.000]  because it sounded like you were having a shitty day
[55:39.000 --> 55:39.840]  that day.
[55:39.840 --> 55:40.660]  Thanks for reaching out to me.
[55:40.660 --> 55:42.600]  I love knowing that I'm cheering people up
[55:42.600 --> 55:43.440]  and making a difference.
[55:43.440 --> 55:45.120]  That means a lot to me,
[55:45.120 --> 55:46.560]  especially somebody who's having a shitty day.
[55:46.560 --> 55:47.760]  I turn their day around.
[55:48.680 --> 55:50.040]  I want to give a shout out to Steve Simone
[55:50.040 --> 55:50.880]  because he does that to me.
[55:50.880 --> 55:51.880]  Whenever I'm in a shitty mood,
[55:51.880 --> 55:54.160]  I listen to Steve Simone on the Good Times podcast,
[55:54.160 --> 55:55.700]  with Steve Simone and Lisa Ayat,
[55:55.700 --> 55:56.880]  and they just cheer me right up.
[55:56.880 --> 55:59.200]  So I'm going to take a quick drink.
[55:59.200 --> 56:00.040]  I'm going to take a sip here.
[56:00.040 --> 56:01.720]  And then I'm going to read this message
[56:01.720 --> 56:03.560]  that I got from our friend, Kelvin Medina,
[56:03.560 --> 56:04.760]  who listens all the time.
[56:04.760 --> 56:06.600]  He rocks a Grow From Your Heart podcast t-shirt.
[56:06.640 --> 56:07.640]  Him and his beautiful girlfriend,
[56:07.640 --> 56:09.240]  I don't know if that's his wife or his girlfriend,
[56:09.240 --> 56:11.400]  they've got matching Grow From Your Heart podcast t-shirts.
[56:11.400 --> 56:12.240]  It's rad as shit.
[56:12.240 --> 56:13.800]  His kid's got a Grow From Your Heart podcast t-shirt.
[56:13.800 --> 56:14.640]  I love it.
[56:14.640 --> 56:15.460]  Yeah, I'm going to take a drink, dude.
[56:15.460 --> 56:16.300]  You say something.
[56:16.300 --> 56:17.680]  So one of the questions was,
[56:17.680 --> 56:19.360]  what's your favorite way to smoke?
[56:19.360 --> 56:21.640]  And I got to say bong hit.
[56:21.640 --> 56:22.480]  Oh, your favorite's a bong hit?
[56:22.480 --> 56:25.700]  Old school bong hit with like an 18 to a 24 inch bong,
[56:26.840 --> 56:30.080]  with the ice catch that I never actually put ice in,
[56:30.080 --> 56:31.840]  but it's got to have an ice catch to it.
[56:31.840 --> 56:33.520]  It pinches it so you don't splash your face.
[56:33.520 --> 56:34.840]  Something to hold onto.
[56:34.840 --> 56:35.680]  Oh, okay.
[56:35.680 --> 56:36.760]  It's got those little divots in it.
[56:36.760 --> 56:38.880]  Yep, it gives you a good handhold,
[56:38.880 --> 56:40.460]  keeps it from back splashing too much.
[56:40.460 --> 56:42.560]  And just the size of that hit,
[56:42.560 --> 56:44.720]  the potency of that hit, that's where-
[56:44.720 --> 56:46.440]  That used to be my thing before dabs.
[56:46.440 --> 56:47.400]  You and I used to sit around
[56:47.400 --> 56:50.360]  and hit the fucking bong all night long.
[56:50.360 --> 56:51.920]  For some reason, when he started talking about bongs
[56:51.920 --> 56:53.840]  with the ice pitch, I've got a bong with an ice pitch
[56:53.840 --> 56:54.880]  that we used to hit.
[56:54.880 --> 56:56.880]  It made me think of my buddy Rob the Dude.
[56:56.880 --> 56:58.760]  For some reason, that fucker was so good
[56:58.760 --> 57:01.240]  at dropping the lighter in the fucking bong.
[57:01.240 --> 57:02.200]  I don't know why he would do it.
[57:02.200 --> 57:03.600]  We had a nice 18 inch bong.
[57:03.600 --> 57:05.440]  I had a bong with a glass base.
[57:06.200 --> 57:08.240]  I've only seen it once and it was a long time ago.
[57:08.240 --> 57:10.760]  He did it more than enough to where I'm like,
[57:10.760 --> 57:12.400]  God, that dude used to fucking drop the lighter
[57:12.400 --> 57:13.360]  in the bong a lot.
[57:13.360 --> 57:14.760]  What was with that?
[57:14.760 --> 57:17.160]  He would set the lighter across the top of the bong
[57:17.160 --> 57:19.320]  and try to pass it to you and you'd be like, no!
[57:19.320 --> 57:21.920]  And you'd just watch it go, boink, and you'd be like, fuck.
[57:21.920 --> 57:22.920]  I get what you're trying to do.
[57:22.920 --> 57:24.840]  It's cute, but it keeps fucking us, bro.
[57:24.840 --> 57:26.480]  Yeah, like, come on, just throw the lighter at me.
[57:26.480 --> 57:27.320]  It's better.
[57:27.320 --> 57:28.140]  Or steal my lighter.
[57:28.140 --> 57:29.720]  It's even better than getting it covered in bong water.
[57:29.720 --> 57:31.240]  I smoked with a dude in college
[57:31.240 --> 57:34.600]  that he wasn't allowed to hold most people's glass.
[57:34.640 --> 57:35.680]  He was just that dude.
[57:35.680 --> 57:38.560]  He'd get baked and he'd stop thinking about it for a second
[57:38.560 --> 57:39.660]  and then he'd drop it.
[57:41.000 --> 57:42.920]  Or he'd take too much of a hit and go to cough
[57:42.920 --> 57:45.160]  and go to cover his face and drop it.
[57:45.160 --> 57:46.880]  And so he was the dude in the circle
[57:46.880 --> 57:49.360]  that the kid next to him had to hold the pipe.
[57:49.360 --> 57:53.040]  My friend Gibbs is a pot dealer's best friend
[57:53.040 --> 57:55.400]  because he will buy a bag of weed
[57:55.400 --> 57:58.240]  and get a notebook or an album cover
[57:58.240 --> 57:59.080]  or whatever's around.
[57:59.080 --> 57:59.960]  Whatever's handy.
[57:59.960 --> 58:02.160]  And a grinder and he'll grind up.
[58:02.160 --> 58:03.360]  Yeah, you were old school, bro.
[58:03.360 --> 58:05.680]  He'll grind up all of his weed into a little pile
[58:05.680 --> 58:06.760]  so that he could put it in a baggie
[58:06.760 --> 58:09.120]  and just go smoke it whenever he's out and about.
[58:09.120 --> 58:10.920]  And he loves to grind it up
[58:10.920 --> 58:14.000]  and then decide to look for his papers and stand up.
[58:14.000 --> 58:16.120]  And so now he's got an album cover in his lap
[58:16.120 --> 58:17.600]  with ground up weed and he stands up
[58:17.600 --> 58:19.960]  and now you've got carpet with carpet weed.
[58:19.960 --> 58:21.840]  And I used to be his weed guy
[58:21.840 --> 58:24.440]  when we lived in an apartment together in Lawrence, Kansas.
[58:24.440 --> 58:26.560]  And I would weigh two bags when I would sell Gibbs weed
[58:26.560 --> 58:28.560]  because I would weigh that first eighth out
[58:28.560 --> 58:30.320]  and hand it to him and he'd hand me money.
[58:30.320 --> 58:31.960]  He'd grind that fucker up, dump it in the floor
[58:31.960 --> 58:33.120]  and just hand me more money.
[58:33.880 --> 58:34.920]  And I'd go get the other one I already had pre-weighed
[58:34.920 --> 58:35.880]  and be like, there you go, buddy.
[58:35.880 --> 58:36.760]  And then I'd smoke him down
[58:36.760 --> 58:38.000]  because I felt bad for the kid all the time.
[58:38.000 --> 58:39.520]  Gibbs, I love you if you're listening, bro.
[58:39.520 --> 58:41.720]  I hear you're in town, hit me up, let's dab.
[58:41.720 --> 58:45.640]  It's a, I'm trying to think.
[58:45.640 --> 58:47.520]  There's just a lot of that little stuff.
[58:47.520 --> 58:49.560]  I mean, everybody's got their own little method.
[58:49.560 --> 58:51.000]  I like the question
[58:51.000 --> 58:52.880]  and I'm loving the answers tripling in.
[58:52.880 --> 58:55.000]  Well, so the question I'll repeat
[58:55.000 --> 58:56.120]  because we got way off topic was,
[58:56.120 --> 58:56.960]  what do you like to eat?
[58:56.960 --> 58:57.800]  What do you like to smoke?
[58:57.800 --> 58:58.880]  What do you like to do after you smoke?
[58:58.880 --> 59:01.060]  So it was 420 and I was just doing a 420 episode.
[59:01.060 --> 59:02.520]  I wanted to be interactive with my friends.
[59:02.960 --> 59:03.800]  I feel like you guys are my friends.
[59:03.800 --> 59:04.620]  We are friends.
[59:04.620 --> 59:06.760]  If you listen to this podcast, we're bros now.
[59:06.760 --> 59:08.640]  And if you're a girl, we're still bros.
[59:08.640 --> 59:09.880]  It works that way.
[59:09.880 --> 59:12.080]  So our friend Kelvin Medina said,
[59:12.080 --> 59:12.920]  what's up, Jeff?
[59:12.920 --> 59:13.760]  How you doing, bud?
[59:13.760 --> 59:16.020]  I'm responding to your question from the podcast.
[59:16.020 --> 59:19.660]  When I get blazed, I like to listen to Mendo Dope on Pandora
[59:19.660 --> 59:22.320]  and it usually mixes all kinds of weed songs.
[59:22.320 --> 59:24.840]  So I find new songs constantly on Pandora,
[59:24.840 --> 59:26.640]  which I really like.
[59:26.640 --> 59:31.140]  So Mendo Dope, they've had Marlon Asher record with them.
[59:31.180 --> 59:33.460]  They've had a lot of famous artists record with them.
[59:33.460 --> 59:38.080]  They are a rap group from Mendo, California.
[59:39.900 --> 59:41.460]  I don't know how to describe it.
[59:42.320 --> 59:44.420]  It's white boy rap from Northern California.
[59:44.420 --> 59:46.860]  It sounds, when I say white boy rap from NorCal,
[59:46.860 --> 59:48.700]  bunch of dudes that grow weed on a farm,
[59:48.700 --> 59:49.980]  you can probably get an idea
[59:49.980 --> 59:50.900]  of what it sounds like in your head.
[59:50.900 --> 59:51.900]  They're friends with Subcool.
[59:51.900 --> 59:53.680]  Subcool hangs out with them a lot.
[59:53.680 --> 59:55.820]  So you guys check out Mendo Dope.
[59:55.820 --> 59:57.480]  Check out Mendo Dope on Pandora.
[59:57.480 --> 59:59.440]  That's what Kelvin Medina is listening to.
[59:59.440 --> 01:00:01.000]  Then he also says,
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.840]  my two favorite foods to eat is pizza and cereal.
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:08.280]  I love a large sausage pizza with a nice cold Sprite.
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:09.120]  That sounds good.
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:10.840]  I don't do sausage, but I like pizza.
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.240]  How's the sausage in NorCal?
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:16.080]  I don't know where Kelvin's from.
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:17.360]  I do, but I don't.
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:19.200]  Mendo Dope is NorCal, yeah.
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.240]  No, he's still alive.
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.080]  That's all right.
[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:22.460]  Mike's high over there.
[01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:23.440]  I know where you're from, Kelvin.
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:25.560]  I'm just not gonna call you out on the show.
[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:27.960]  Then he says, my go-to cereal is Froot Loops.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  It always chills out my munchies.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.320]  That sounds good, Froot Loops.
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:33.380]  I don't do milk, but I would put some soy milk
[01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:35.160]  or some almond milk and some Froot Loops in there,
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:37.600]  maybe just some damn Froot Loops by themselves.
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:38.720]  That sounds tasty.
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:39.560]  Then he said-
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:40.720]  You look like a Christmas tree
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.760]  and just take the box down dry.
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:43.600]  Yeah, just-
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:44.720]  You eat it like popcorn.
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:45.880]  Fuck your mouth all up.
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:48.000]  Get your mouth all cut up in there.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:48.840]  No regrets, right?
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:49.680]  Just go in.
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:52.560]  I remember when Cap'n Crunch used to fuck my mouth up.
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:53.920]  My mom would be like, just chew it.
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.280]  If you give it a minute, you'll be all right.
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:56.680]  Like, no, just give me more.
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:58.880]  Two of my favorite munchies are Cap'n Crunch
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:01.000]  and Cheetos Puffs, and both just shred
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.720]  the fuck out of your mouth.
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.480]  What's with sick people that love to eat,
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:06.240]  and I'm one of them, so I'm calling us all out,
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.880]  the Flamin' Hot Cheese Puffs.
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:08.720]  Oh, yeah, I don't-
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:09.540]  The Hot Cheetos.
[01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:10.760]  Oh, dude, I can't get enough.
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:12.360]  That's something broken inside of you.
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:13.200]  Yeah.
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.960]  Like, it's a common thing that's broken in people.
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:15.800]  It's like, ooh, that's hot.
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:17.040]  I'm gonna eat another one.
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:17.880]  Ooh, that's hot.
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:18.840]  I wanna eat another one.
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:19.680]  I don't know what it is.
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:21.040]  And then you lick your fingers when you're done,
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.980]  and it's like fucking Satan in your mouth.
[01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:23.880]  Oh, it's so good.
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.400]  There's a special that you can pull up online
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:28.400]  about the dude that invented the Flamin' Hot Cheetos.
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:29.880]  That was a fuck up.
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:32.200]  Like, the Cheeto factory, the Cheeto dust
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:33.400]  didn't get put on a load,
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:36.800]  and employees were allowed to take home naked Cheetos.
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.800]  And dude went home and hit him with some chili powder
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:40.080]  and brought him to work the next day,
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:41.320]  and now he's a multi-millionaire.
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:42.160]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:43.560]  Like, it's a crazy fucking story
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:44.760]  that a bunch of people are addicted to,
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:46.080]  but I don't know how you guys eat that shit.
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:48.640]  I take half a bite, and I'm like, no, ah, why?
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:50.880]  Mexican girls with no eyebrows everywhere
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.280]  are loving that, dude.
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:54.000]  When I worked in youth corrections,
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  that was the most popular thing in commissary.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:56.840]  Yep, yep.
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:58.280]  I cooked like 12 different jail meals
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:00.280]  with Flamin' Hot Cheetos as a base.
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:01.400]  Call centers everywhere
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:03.280]  are surviving off of Flamin' Hot Cheetos.
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:05.880]  All right, we're getting a little off track,
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:06.720]  and a little racist.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:08.360]  They fucking love it when we ramble.
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:10.320]  Well, I hope so, because we're doing it.
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:13.160]  Kelvin also says, last thing I like to make,
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:15.840]  last thing is I like to make special brownies to get blazed,
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:17.920]  and a good nice bong rip from my bubbler
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:20.280]  always chills me out at the end of a hard work day.
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.440]  Wait, bong rip from his bubbler?
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:22.600]  Hey, I was gonna call him out, bro.
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:24.600]  He likes to take a nice fat rip from his bubbler.
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:25.640]  He put the word bong in there,
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:26.480]  because there's water in it.
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:28.040]  We'll call it a bong rip from his bubbler,
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:29.640]  but it's a bubbler rip.
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:30.920]  But Kelvin's cool, so we'll let him say
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:32.520]  whatever the fuck he wants, because he's awesome.
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:34.000]  Yeah, do it, Kelvin.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:34.840]  Yeah.
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:36.040]  Bong rip that bubbler all night, buddy.
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:37.160]  Yeah, do it.
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:38.680]  And then he says, much love, brother.
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:40.800]  Dude, much love for always listening to the show.
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:42.360]  He is an avid listener.
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:43.600]  He's very loyal.
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:44.720]  He's a very cool guy.
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.600]  I appreciate having him as a listener.
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:48.160]  Thanks for the message.
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:49.920]  You guys, it's not too late to let me know
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:52.200]  what you like to eat, what you like to drink,
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:53.960]  what your favorite kind of munchies are.
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:56.000]  And maybe there's a certain movie you like to put on.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:56.960]  Maybe there's certain music.
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:59.480]  I wanna know what you do after you get blazed.
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:00.840]  Also, how do you do it?
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:01.680]  Do you take a bong rip?
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:02.520]  Do you smoke a joint?
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:03.560]  Do you take a dab?
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:05.160]  Do you boof it?
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:06.000]  Don't boof it.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:06.840]  You could boof it.
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:07.680]  Granny boofs it.
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:08.880]  Lots of people boofing it.
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:11.880]  It's a great way to medicate if you need to medicate heavy.
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:15.560]  But I don't need to medicate heavy,
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:17.480]  and so I ain't gonna boof it.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:18.440]  Granny put...
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:21.080]  Did you end up on the boofing episode?
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:23.160]  Did you read the text I sent you?
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:24.880]  No, but a lot of...
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:25.720]  I had my...
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:26.560]  I have friends that are like...
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:28.520]  Your response was that was the same response I got
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:29.360]  from like eight people.
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:30.360]  Yeah, several people were like,
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:32.160]  I'm not gonna listen to that one, dude.
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:36.500]  Oh, I thought it was a really topical episode.
[01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:37.340]  I loved it.
[01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:38.720]  I agreed with Bo Nellis on that one.
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:39.920]  A lot of people did not listen.
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.280]  Shout out to Bo Nellis.
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:43.080]  It's the second time you brought Bo up tonight.
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:47.240]  It's something I've noticed in a lot of people.
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:50.000]  Why don't you wanna learn about some shit, people?
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.720]  What are you afraid about learning?
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:54.360]  Are you scared of getting smarter?
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:56.560]  Does knowing the answer hurt your head?
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:59.860]  Because it takes the pain out of mind.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.480]  I've heard that a bunch of times.
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:04.980]  I just don't wanna know anything about that, okay?
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:06.640]  I just...
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:08.600]  Willful ignorance, it's not a good thing.
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.400]  Mike just got off on one of the Mike rants.
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.360]  Get out of your box, learn some new shit.
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:13.880]  Get out of your box and learn some new shit.
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:14.720]  That's a message for Mike's future.
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:16.000]  You need to know what it's like
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:19.360]  when people medicate by boofing hash oil.
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:22.200]  Maybe.
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:23.920]  This is information you need to know.
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:25.080]  It's a lot to listen to, though.
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:26.920]  Granny and myself and two other ladies
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:28.480]  talking about putting cannabis products
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:29.720]  inside of their bodies.
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:31.200]  So I'm gonna try to reroute this
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.220]  and get away from the butthole talk.
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:36.960]  Also, part of that, I got a tweet from Barry O
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.440]  letting us know what he was consuming.
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:41.200]  I may have said this on the last episode.
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:42.040]  I don't know.
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:42.860]  I wrote it down.
[01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:43.980]  I didn't put a check mark through it last time.
[01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:47.420]  So Barry O is smoking pineapple blast
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:49.220]  that he grew and a friend extracted.
[01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:51.420]  The picture on Twitter looked delicious.
[01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:53.020]  I would dab that.
[01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:55.380]  Barry O, let's take some dabs together.
[01:04:57.380 --> 01:04:58.220]  All right.
[01:04:58.220 --> 01:04:59.040]  Shout out to Barry O.
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:04:59.880]  Shout out to Barry O.
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:01.540]  He's been around since the beginning as well.
[01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:02.780]  Yeah, one of the longtime listeners.
[01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:05.740]  I think he actually won a prize on episode 50 or 100.
[01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:07.500]  That might have been one of the prize winners.
[01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:08.340]  Maybe.
[01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:09.160]  He needs a prize.
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:10.340]  He hasn't won one yet.
[01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:11.620]  We haven't done prizes in a while.
[01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:13.220]  Maybe we'll do that again eventually.
[01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:14.900]  Mike, you like to give shit away on my show.
[01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:15.900]  How do you do that?
[01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:16.740]  It's funny.
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:18.540]  Like I'm gonna give it you.
[01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:20.900]  Honestly, this is a hell of a ramble cast
[01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:21.980]  and I'm looking at my phone.
[01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:23.220]  We've been going for a while.
[01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:26.060]  An hour and five minutes and 21.9 seconds,
[01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:27.860]  but we're gonna be okay.
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:31.180]  Of the thousands of people that started listening to this,
[01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:33.580]  there's probably a dedicated couple of hundred
[01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:35.420]  that made it this far.
[01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:38.380]  Of them, maybe six people are sober enough,
[01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:41.140]  coherent enough, and cognizant enough
[01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:43.540]  to remember to text you later about whatever prize.
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:45.820]  Like it's a safe time to play around.
[01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:46.940]  What are you gonna give away, Mike?
[01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:48.940]  Nothing, I'm just saying we should do it again soon.
[01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:52.220]  Yes, let's, I've got a Grow From Your Heart podcast t-shirt
[01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:54.540]  that we can set up some sort of a contest for.
[01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:57.340]  I just uncovered a huge stash of stickers
[01:05:57.340 --> 01:05:59.340]  that I had been collecting for no reason.
[01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:01.220]  I've got stickers all the time.
[01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:03.380]  Yeah, I know we can find something to stuff in an envelope
[01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:05.020]  and I think we can dig under the couch
[01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:07.260]  and find 68 cents to slap on an envelope.
[01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:09.420]  68 cents, bro, shipping is expensive nowadays.
[01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:10.700]  Where you been?
[01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:11.540]  Home.
[01:06:11.540 --> 01:06:12.620]  Home with the kid.
[01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:13.780]  I don't mail shit to people.
[01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:14.980]  Let's get you home with the kid, bro.
[01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:15.820]  We've been going for a long time.
[01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:16.860]  I can't email it, I ain't mailing it.
[01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:17.820]  Yeah, right, it's the future.
[01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:19.740]  We gotta, fuck snail mail.
[01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:21.540]  Coming up in a future episode, since I wrote it down,
[01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:22.940]  we're obviously not gonna get to it this time.
[01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:25.140]  We're gonna talk about a little auto flower question.
[01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:27.980]  Somebody sent me a question about outdoor growing.
[01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:28.820]  That is not my wheelhouse.
[01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:29.700]  That's a Jesse question.
[01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:31.220]  That's a Jesse question, I wrote it down.
[01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:32.420]  We gotta get Jesse here.
[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:35.460]  I will ask Jesse that question on a future episode.
[01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:38.220]  Somebody sent me a message about nutrients
[01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:39.940]  and how frequently they use nutrients.
[01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:41.460]  I'll address that on a future episode.
[01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:43.140]  Also, it's written down right here on the notebook.
[01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:45.140]  Mike and I got off on a ramble because we spoke
[01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:45.980]  this morning. You've done a good
[01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:47.340]  watering and feeding episode or two,
[01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:49.540]  if you wanna dig through the feed, whoever asked that.
[01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:51.780]  You know what, I've started working
[01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:54.620]  at different large-scale cultivation centers
[01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:55.820]  and I've learned a lot about feeding,
[01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:58.060]  so it may be time to do a little update on that.
[01:06:58.060 --> 01:06:59.860]  Oh, it's definitely time.
[01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:01.580]  As I was saying that, I was like, yeah,
[01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:03.780]  at best that was two and a half years ago,
[01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:05.780]  so times have changed.
[01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:08.260]  That was at least five years ago when I did that episode, Mike.
[01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:09.100]  11 years ago.
[01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:10.820]  That was 11 teen days ago.
[01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:12.140]  You don't even know, bro.
[01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:14.900]  So I'm circling auto flower, nutrients.
[01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:15.860]  What was the other one that I said?
[01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:16.700]  I hope I fucking remember.
[01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:17.540]  I don't know.
[01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:18.380]  I feel like we should troll some people
[01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:19.380]  before we sign off tonight.
[01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:21.220]  No, Mike, we're not gonna troll people tonight, bro.
[01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:22.660]  Let's keep it on a podcast level.
[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:23.500]  Let's do this.
[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:26.180]  It looks like all your boxes are checked.
[01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:27.340]  I circled some stuff.
[01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:28.180]  I checked my boxes.
[01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:29.660]  This is where I am right now.
[01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:31.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'd love to hear from you.
[01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:32.420]  I like it when you message me.
[01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:33.760]  As much as you like it when we ramble,
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:35.060]  I like it when you interact with me.
[01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:35.900]  You can send me an email.
[01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:37.540]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:39.820]  I would love to answer all of your grow questions.
[01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:42.380]  Find me on Twitter at GFYH podcast.
[01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:43.860]  Tweet me a whole bunch of stuff.
[01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:45.420]  On Facebook, it's easy.
[01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:47.080]  Search for grow from your heart.
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:50.760]  Everybody that contributed on Patreon, holy crap.
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:51.900]  Thank you guys.
[01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:52.740]  I appreciate it.
[01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:53.700]  That's so awesome people, thank you.
[01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:54.740]  Yeah, there are a couple of people
[01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:56.780]  that are throwing down a noticeable amount
[01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:58.980]  of money every month, and I truly appreciate that.
[01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:00.500]  Honestly, if you're throwing down a dollar,
[01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:02.100]  if you're throwing down whatever other people
[01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:03.780]  are throwing down, if you're one of the big guys,
[01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:05.700]  one of the little guys, holy shit, thank you.
[01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:06.740]  I appreciate you.
[01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:07.940]  I love you for that.
[01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:10.340]  If you were not able to contribute to Patreon
[01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:12.740]  and you're listening to the podcast, I still love you.
[01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:13.580]  It's fucking awesome.
[01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:15.580]  You're supporting the show in the way that you can.
[01:08:15.580 --> 01:08:17.060]  I appreciate it.
[01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:19.500]  It'd be super cool if you can contribute to Patreon.
[01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:23.220]  If you want info, go to patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:28.220]  It's P-A-T-R-E-O-N dot com slash growfromyourheart.
[01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:31.320]  All the information that you need will be there.
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:33.700]  You'll learn how to financially contribute to the podcast.
[01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:35.580]  You'll help me cover the cost of my website.
[01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:37.620]  You'll help me cover the cost of some of the equipment
[01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:38.460]  that I buy.
[01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:39.620]  I need little foamies for the microphones,
[01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:41.020]  these little things here.
[01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:42.460]  Mike's been spitting into this one all night.
[01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:45.220]  I gotta replace it before more people come and smell Mike's.
[01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:47.620]  Mine's got an odd odor tonight,
[01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:49.060]  and it's got a big, heavy crease in it
[01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:50.900]  that makes it look overly phallic.
[01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:53.420]  The crease is because the thing was stored in the bag,
[01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:54.740]  and it does look a little phallic-y.
[01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:56.540]  I've been trying not to notice that.
[01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:57.660]  I tried to ignore that all night,
[01:08:57.660 --> 01:08:59.060]  but you gotta point out the dick look.
[01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:00.220]  Good job, Mike.
[01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:02.140]  But you guys, go contribute on Patreon.
[01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:03.380]  I would love your support.
[01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:04.940]  $1 a month is all I ask for.
[01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:07.140]  If you wanna do $1 million,
[01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:08.540]  I'll be your best friend forever.
[01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:11.420]  Anywhere in between, I completely appreciate it.
[01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:14.100]  Big thanks to everybody who has contributed to Patreon.
[01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:16.520]  I felt like there was one more thing that I wanted to say,
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:17.620]  but oh, you can go to iTunes.
[01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:18.740]  That's what I would like.
[01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:21.460]  If you're listening on iTunes or an Apple device,
[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:23.900]  go to, and they're changing the way I'm supposed to say this.
[01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:25.580]  I got an email from Apple iTunes
[01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:27.380]  telling me that you have to change your branding
[01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:28.380]  and stuff on.
[01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:29.660]  Yeah, it's now, it's not iTunes.
[01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:31.780]  iTunes and podcasts are separating themselves.
[01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:33.860]  It's not the same entity.
[01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:35.460]  Yeah, this is just a lot of weird talk.
[01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:36.420]  It's from Apple.
[01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:39.500]  Yeah, but it's now Apple, it's Apple Podcasts,
[01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:40.860]  not iTunes Podcast.
[01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:41.940]  It's a different thing.
[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:43.820]  I don't know what they're gonna do with that in the future.
[01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:45.340]  It feels like something's coming in the future
[01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:47.820]  because all the podcasters got an email about it.
[01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:48.660]  But what you can do-
[01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:50.740]  Sounds like somebody ran out of data storage.
[01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:53.700]  Go to iTunes, go to the iTunes store,
[01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:55.220]  search for the ratings and reviews section.
[01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:56.700]  It's right in the middle.
[01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:58.540]  Go to, no, you search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:09:58.540 --> 01:09:59.860]  Go to iTunes, go to the iTunes store.
[01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:00.700]  Up in the top right,
[01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:02.340]  search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:05.900]  A little icon will pop up with my face right there.
[01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:06.740]  Click on that.
[01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:07.580]  You gotta do it on your computer
[01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:08.420]  because if you do it on my phone,
[01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:10.580]  it'll just take you to the episode and it'll start playing.
[01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:12.820]  So do it on your computer.
[01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:14.100]  Go to the comments and reviews,
[01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:15.140]  the ratings and reviews section.
[01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:15.980]  It's right in the middle.
[01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:16.940]  Click on that.
[01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:17.780]  Write in a comment.
[01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:19.260]  Let me know what you think about the podcast.
[01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:22.020]  I will read your comment on a future episode.
[01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:24.740]  I try to do one about every six episodes.
[01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:25.940]  I try to put in the comments.
[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:27.780]  Just depends on how many I get.
[01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:29.140]  There've been some great comments lately.
[01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:30.900]  Somebody called me the Joe Rogan of cannabis.
[01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:31.740]  That's fucking awesome.
[01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:32.820]  Thanks again for that.
[01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:33.820]  Go leave a comment.
[01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:35.060]  I would love to know what you think about the show.
[01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:38.540]  So far, everybody has left me a five star review.
[01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:39.960]  I'm not begging you for five stars,
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:42.540]  but be cool like everybody else and feel what you,
[01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:44.140]  leave what you feel I deserve.
[01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:45.260]  You guys, I feel like I've been rambling
[01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:46.740]  for a whole long time.
[01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:48.700]  Mike's sitting over here spinning a dab pencil at me
[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:50.420]  like, bro, can we fucking turn off the mics
[01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:51.900]  and take some dabs?
[01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:52.900]  Yeah, we're gonna do that.
[01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:55.140]  Mike's gonna cough for like six minutes into the microphone.
[01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:57.340]  So we're gonna cut out the mics before we dab.
[01:10:57.580 --> 01:11:00.780]  This should also be noted that THCA made me fidgety.
[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:03.700]  Yeah, it definitely gets you moving.
[01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:05.060]  It's Mother's Day, you guys.
[01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:07.380]  This podcast comes out on Monday,
[01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:08.940]  but that means that you've got until Sunday
[01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:10.460]  to get your Mother's Day shit together.
[01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:11.580]  Get mom some flowers.
[01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:12.420]  Be on it.
[01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:13.740]  Do something good for mama.
[01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:15.260]  If your mom is gone, I apologize.
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:16.420]  Much love and respect to your mama.
[01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:17.600]  I apologize for bringing that up,
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:18.740]  but take care of your mama, damn it.
[01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:20.420]  She took care of you, hopefully, maybe.
[01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:22.180]  And if she didn't, fuck it, send her flowers anyway.
[01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:23.540]  She's still your mama.
[01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:25.580]  Take care of that old lady.
[01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:26.460]  What else do we got?
[01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:29.980]  I wanna give a huge shout out to Colonel Bruce Hampton.
[01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:31.380]  Mike looked at me like, huh?
[01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:33.300]  Shout it out.
[01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:35.540]  Colonel Bruce Hampton passed away on stage
[01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:36.380]  a few nights ago.
[01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:37.200]  He's a musician.
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:38.040]  He was doing a show.
[01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:39.980]  He's a rascal.
[01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:41.340]  He was an older cat.
[01:11:41.340 --> 01:11:42.680]  He's a hilarious dude.
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:44.220]  He's played with several bands.
[01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:47.460]  He was on stage at a show and had a heart attack on stage
[01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:49.820]  in front of a lot of people doing a Grateful Dead song
[01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:50.980]  that he loved playing.
[01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:52.540]  It's always sad when people go,
[01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:55.100]  but if you go doing what you love,
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:57.900]  I can't be too sad.
[01:11:57.900 --> 01:11:59.660]  The only shitty part about it is he did it
[01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:01.900]  in front of a club full of people.
[01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:02.900]  So that's kind of weird.
[01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:04.060]  People filmed it.
[01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:05.540]  Honestly, I called him a rascal
[01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:07.700]  because he's known for pulling jokes
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:09.500]  and everyone thought he was kidding.
[01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:10.400]  Just thought it was a stunt?
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:12.540]  Yeah, because he was on stage and the music's going
[01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:14.020]  and he grabs, they're playing a song called
[01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:15.460]  "'Turn On Your Love Light'
[01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:16.540]  and it's, "'Turn On Your Love Light,
[01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:18.620]  let it shine on me," and it gets all moving.
[01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:20.420]  Then he falls on the ground and grabs his chest
[01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:22.180]  and everyone's like, ha, ha, ha, it's love light
[01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:23.620]  or whatever, you know what I mean?
[01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:25.580]  And then he didn't get up.
[01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:27.580]  And so, shout out to Colonel Bruce,
[01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:30.220]  a hell of a musician, a great entertainer.
[01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:34.240]  The jam band scene is going to miss that crazy old man.
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:36.280]  But you're right, dude, going out playing music,
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:40.020]  I, I, I could go off on a really long rant here.
[01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:42.920]  You guys, I wanna, I kinda wanna be killed
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:45.140]  by the silverback gorilla at the Denver Zoo.
[01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:46.820]  I don't know how true that is, but it sounds good.
[01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:48.100]  Well, Matt, cancer sucks, right?
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:49.020]  Drunk drivers suck.
[01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:50.660]  I mean, if you're gonna pick it,
[01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:53.380]  the mauled to death by gorilla.
[01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:56.380]  It's quick and easy, and then my daughter gets a zoo.
[01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:59.820]  I'm more like in bed with a hot chick when I'm old.
[01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:00.940]  How many of your friends have died
[01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:02.820]  by getting eaten by a silverback?
[01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:04.580]  You'd fucking remember that, right?
[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:08.660]  I, I like to think I hang out with people
[01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:11.700]  that are memorable for things other than how they died.
[01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:12.780]  That's a really good answer.
[01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:14.020]  How your candle got snuffed
[01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:16.660]  shouldn't be the most interesting thing about your ass.
[01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:18.220]  Ladies and gentlemen, I think it's time for us
[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:19.480]  to turn off these microphones
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:21.340]  and put some more dabs inside of our heads.
[01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:22.380]  I wanna thank everybody for listening
[01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:23.780]  to a really rambly podcast.
[01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:24.600]  I'll be back.
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:26.620]  If you're still listening, please tweet me,
[01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:28.180]  tell me what you thought of the show.
[01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:29.420]  Haven't been on it a while.
[01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:31.020]  Missed the fuck out of it.
[01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:31.860]  Glad to be back.
[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:33.780]  Mike doesn't wanna turn off the mics.
[01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:35.500]  Mike wants to keep micing up the mics.
[01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:38.100]  Yep, I just, yeah, I wanna say goodnight, folks.
[01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:39.620]  Love you, missed you.
[01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:40.460]  Mike, you'll be back soon.
[01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:41.860]  We've missed you also, bro.
[01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:43.260]  Show will be back next Monday.
[01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:44.100]  Shout out to Mike's wife
[01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:45.700]  for letting him come play for a little bit.
[01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:47.980]  Yep, I'm just looking at the time like,
[01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:50.540]  man, my kid's gonna cry any minute and my wife's asleep.
[01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:52.380]  I hope I get home before that happens
[01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:54.180]  so that I don't get in trouble, but yeah.
[01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:55.020]  All right, we're gonna turn off the mics.
[01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:55.860]  This is fun.
[01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:57.540]  Love you guys, have a good night.
[01:13:57.540 --> 01:13:59.060]  Ladies and gentlemen, Mike said it all.
[01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:00.220]  He's taking off his headphones already.
[01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:01.500]  He's giving the fuck up.
[01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:02.660]  I wanna thank everybody for listening.
[01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:04.460]  Check out all the social media.
[01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:06.400]  Be good to one another.
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:07.700]  Don't smoke shitty oil.
[01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:09.420]  Don't spray your plants with bullshit.
[01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:10.620]  Be kind to one another.
[01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:12.420]  I don't know, I ain't got much else.
[01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:13.380]  Big shout out to Colonel Bruce,
[01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:15.340]  and until next time, take a fat dab
[01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:16.900]  and give your mama a hug for me.
