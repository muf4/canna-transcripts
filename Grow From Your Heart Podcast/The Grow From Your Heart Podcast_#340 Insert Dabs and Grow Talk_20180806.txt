[01:22.660 --> 01:25.580]  It's time for episode three 40 of the grow from your heart podcast.
[01:25.580 --> 01:26.580]  Before we get too far,
[01:26.580 --> 01:29.860]  I owe a huge shout out to Martin land for that opening track called roast in
[01:29.860 --> 01:33.580]  style one. Thanks for the great intro music. That sounds great.
[01:33.700 --> 01:37.100]  Totally fits my vibe. I dig it. Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:37.100 --> 01:39.860]  you know I like to start the episodes off by letting you know what I'm dabbing
[01:39.860 --> 01:44.180]  on today. I'm taking dabs of gunslinger nectar from green dot labs.
[01:44.620 --> 01:48.700]  The label says it is starfighter and star dog combined together in one run.
[01:48.780 --> 01:50.620]  The flavor is described as watermelon,
[01:50.620 --> 01:53.180]  gummy slices and fresh ripe watermelons.
[01:53.540 --> 01:55.420]  I definitely got a watermelon flavor.
[01:55.420 --> 01:58.860]  I also had a hint of strawberries in there. It was delicious.
[01:59.220 --> 02:02.300]  I would almost describe it like those candies that your grandma has in the
[02:02.300 --> 02:05.500]  candy dish. They're wrapped in a package that looks like a fake strawberry.
[02:05.740 --> 02:08.260]  You suck on it for a couple of minutes and then you always got a bite into that
[02:08.260 --> 02:11.460]  thing. And then it's got like a gooey strawberry texture in the middle. Uh,
[02:11.500 --> 02:15.580]  that's exactly what this concentrate tasted like. So great work as always,
[02:15.700 --> 02:18.460]  to our friends at green dot labs.
[02:19.900 --> 02:22.700]  And I guess that makes a great segue. The dabs I was taking today.
[02:22.700 --> 02:26.100]  We're not my normal dabs. These were upgraded fancy dads. That's right.
[02:26.140 --> 02:30.340]  I'm dabbing in style extra classy today. My friends at happy daddy,
[02:30.340 --> 02:33.540]  happy daddy products sent me a very nice care package,
[02:33.540 --> 02:38.060]  which consisted of a new quartz banger that also came with a
[02:38.060 --> 02:41.780]  dab insert. I'm sure we talked about insert dabs recently on the show.
[02:41.980 --> 02:45.060]  We'll talk about them again in just a second. They sent me the quartz banger.
[02:45.340 --> 02:48.700]  They sent me this dope insert. They sent me some Terp spinners.
[02:48.940 --> 02:52.380]  They sent me a really cool glob father to dabber.
[02:52.620 --> 02:55.180]  They sent me a sweet carb cap to go with the new banger.
[02:55.380 --> 02:58.260]  They sent me a customized glob father to dabber.
[02:58.580 --> 03:01.500]  They sent me a hat pin dabber. They sent me a key chain.
[03:01.500 --> 03:04.540]  They sent me a plethora of great smoking accessories.
[03:04.540 --> 03:07.460]  I've got one of those grinder cards is a little card that you can carry in your
[03:07.460 --> 03:09.540]  wallet, pull it out. And it works as a grinder.
[03:09.940 --> 03:11.820]  It's kind of like a cheese grater for your cannabis.
[03:12.100 --> 03:13.780]  It works great if you're trying to roll a joint.
[03:14.420 --> 03:17.700]  They sent me a great care package. So first off, huge,
[03:17.780 --> 03:20.500]  thank you shout out to my friends at happy daddy products.
[03:20.500 --> 03:24.140]  I'm totally satisfied. I love my new nail. I love the insert dabs.
[03:24.140 --> 03:27.660]  I love the new carb cap and these dabbers. This is what all started it off.
[03:27.660 --> 03:30.380]  I wanted one of these glob father to dabbers. And he's like, well,
[03:30.380 --> 03:33.020]  let me send you a package. And he just sent me a whole bunch of great stuff.
[03:33.020 --> 03:35.900]  So huge shout out to my friends at happy daddy products.
[03:35.900 --> 03:39.540]  Now let's talk about these insert dabs a little bit. Um,
[03:39.580 --> 03:41.580]  now that I've got my own insert dab set up,
[03:41.580 --> 03:45.460]  I've had some time to play with it and experiment and experience this. Um,
[03:45.660 --> 03:46.500]  I like it.
[03:46.580 --> 03:50.780]  Mike said on Instagram today that it was better than he expected and hit him
[03:50.780 --> 03:52.340]  harder than he had anticipated.
[03:52.340 --> 03:54.500]  So it sounds like Mike likes the insert dabs.
[03:54.500 --> 03:59.340]  Also let's talk about the main differences between
[03:59.360 --> 04:01.940]  taking normal dabs and insert dabs.
[04:03.940 --> 04:06.660]  Where do I want to start? Do we want to start with the normal nail? Sure.
[04:06.660 --> 04:10.540]  Back in the day, we used to heat up a titanium nail. It looked like a screw.
[04:10.620 --> 04:13.540]  It had a head on it. It had another piece on it. They would screw up and down.
[04:13.820 --> 04:17.340]  That would fit in the joint of your rig or bong. You needed a male joint.
[04:17.340 --> 04:22.060]  So you'd either get a, a pipe or a bong or a bubble or with a male joint. Um,
[04:22.300 --> 04:25.700]  if you didn't have a male, you'd get an adapter that made it a male joint.
[04:26.060 --> 04:29.540]  Then the nail would fit in that joint. And then a dome would slide over that.
[04:29.540 --> 04:31.540]  You'd heat up the nail, put the dome over that,
[04:31.540 --> 04:33.900]  and then you'd touch the dab to that hot nail.
[04:34.220 --> 04:36.500]  And then that dome would trap the smoke in there.
[04:36.500 --> 04:37.700]  And then you could smoke it through your pipe.
[04:37.700 --> 04:40.860]  I'll explain this joint part that I keep talking about that part where you put
[04:40.860 --> 04:43.260]  your bong bowl into the bong. Uh,
[04:43.260 --> 04:46.300]  usually it's a hole and the bong bowl slides into there.
[04:46.820 --> 04:48.300]  Imagine if they did that the opposite.
[04:48.740 --> 04:53.700]  Imagine if the hole was on the bong bowl and the male part was actually sticking
[04:53.700 --> 04:56.340]  off of the bong or the bubbler. So you got like a little,
[04:56.620 --> 04:59.660]  a little male joint sticking off. Then you slide this nail into there.
[04:59.660 --> 05:01.260]  And you use the screw part,
[05:01.300 --> 05:05.140]  the nut that would be on the screw to adjust the height of how far it sticks up
[05:05.140 --> 05:07.780]  out of that joint. So it doesn't go too high out of the dome.
[05:07.980 --> 05:10.260]  And then you want to put the dome on there and you want to aim it to where that,
[05:10.780 --> 05:14.300]  uh, the head of that nail is basically right in the center height of the dome is
[05:14.300 --> 05:18.020]  what you'd kind of aim for. So back in the day, we used to use a titanium nail,
[05:18.020 --> 05:21.700]  hopefully it was titanium. Uh, then like I mentioned in the 710 episode,
[05:21.700 --> 05:26.380]  TaskRock made the Flux nail, then TaskRock made the Domeless nail,
[05:26.380 --> 05:30.180]  then TaskRock made the Infinity nail. Uh, it evolved quite heavily.
[05:30.940 --> 05:35.780]  Then glass blowers got in on it and we started using quartz or glass
[05:35.860 --> 05:38.180]  bangers instead of titanium nails.
[05:38.180 --> 05:40.540]  I highly recommend you go listen to my 710 episode.
[05:40.740 --> 05:42.580]  It will teach you all the details on this.
[05:42.940 --> 05:47.540]  So they started making what's called a club banger along with the club
[05:47.940 --> 05:52.540]  banger came the evolution of our rigs where they started putting female joints on
[05:52.540 --> 05:55.580]  the rigs and making the bangers themselves males.
[05:56.460 --> 06:00.660]  These little rigs were usually somewhere between six and eight inches tall,
[06:00.700 --> 06:03.460]  kind of wide based with the mouthpiece coming up off the top,
[06:03.580 --> 06:07.180]  just a spot to hang a nail on it. And they basically call it a banger hanger.
[06:07.740 --> 06:10.140]  Now all the rigs are available in males or females,
[06:10.140 --> 06:12.900]  depending on the artwork or the style of the rig or what you prefer.
[06:13.140 --> 06:15.820]  And the joints are also available in males or females.
[06:15.820 --> 06:19.220]  And they're also available in 45 or 90 degree angles.
[06:19.220 --> 06:22.420]  That way you can get your nail. Uh, you want them straight up and down.
[06:22.420 --> 06:23.580]  You want to horizontal with the ground.
[06:23.580 --> 06:27.220]  So based on what angle your joint comes off of your rig,
[06:27.300 --> 06:30.820]  you need the appropriate setup. So we've gotten it all customized by now.
[06:30.820 --> 06:34.180]  We figured out that we would need males and females. We know what sizes we need.
[06:34.180 --> 06:36.540]  Let me get onto, uh, we went to the banger.
[06:36.540 --> 06:41.460]  We went from titanium into the banger. The banger is, so my rig,
[06:41.500 --> 06:44.900]  my joint points straight up. So I need a 90 degree angle on here.
[06:44.940 --> 06:49.100]  I've got a female rig. So my rig has a hole. It is a female.
[06:49.100 --> 06:53.820]  That sounds weird, but it's got a hole. It is a female. My nail,
[06:53.820 --> 06:57.940]  my banger is a male. It's got a joint. So the joint slides right into the hole.
[06:57.940 --> 07:00.460]  That's pretty self-explanatory. It goes straight up.
[07:00.500 --> 07:04.180]  Then it turns it at 90 degree angle. At the end of that 90 degree angle,
[07:04.180 --> 07:06.780]  there is basically a large glass thimble.
[07:06.940 --> 07:11.460]  It would be similar to a thimble or maybe a really tiny shot glass.
[07:12.060 --> 07:14.940]  The bottom of it is quite thick. It's thicker than the sides.
[07:14.940 --> 07:16.740]  That is so that the bottom will retain heat.
[07:17.300 --> 07:20.300]  The sidewalls are fairly thick, but not as thick as the bottom.
[07:20.940 --> 07:23.900]  My pointer finger fits in here quite smoothly.
[07:23.900 --> 07:26.900]  My middle finger fits in there, uh, kind of snugly.
[07:26.900 --> 07:29.300]  And it goes all the way to the first knuckle.
[07:29.340 --> 07:33.700]  If that gives you any idea of the depth and the internal diameter is probably
[07:33.720 --> 07:37.420]  the size of a dime. So you could stack dimes in here if you wanted to.
[07:37.620 --> 07:40.380]  So that's the size of the banger. Now I put that,
[07:40.380 --> 07:44.900]  I dropped that right into the rig and then I heat the bottom corner.
[07:44.940 --> 07:49.740]  I heat where the floor and the wall meet because I want the heat to be focused
[07:49.740 --> 07:52.220]  on the bottom because it's real thick there. It's going to retain the heat.
[07:52.780 --> 07:53.740]  Then the walls.
[07:53.740 --> 07:56.500]  I want to have some heat also just to have that heat all around because I'm
[07:56.500 --> 07:59.140]  going to use this radiant heat to heat my dab.
[07:59.180 --> 08:04.180]  Now here is where the difference between a normal banger dab and an insert
[08:04.220 --> 08:05.420]  dab come into play.
[08:05.740 --> 08:08.740]  And there are a couple of ways to do these insert dabs and I'll talk about them
[08:08.740 --> 08:12.820]  both. Now, before we had insert dabs, we would heat this banger,
[08:14.100 --> 08:17.140]  uh, fairly hot and then let it cool to our desired temperature.
[08:17.140 --> 08:19.780]  Everybody likes a different temperature on their dabs. Uh,
[08:19.980 --> 08:22.300]  you probably know by now I go hotter than most folks.
[08:22.420 --> 08:23.700]  Some folks like them nice and cool.
[08:23.700 --> 08:26.340]  You got to get a Q-tip and clean half your dab out of the banger when you're
[08:26.340 --> 08:30.500]  done. There's not much left when I'm done. So the way we would normally do it,
[08:30.500 --> 08:32.940]  we'd heat that banger, let it cool to the appropriate temperature,
[08:32.940 --> 08:34.980]  use your hand or whatever to judge how hot it is.
[08:35.140 --> 08:38.180]  You put your dab on the end of a dabber, you press it into the banger.
[08:38.500 --> 08:42.580]  Once the dab all falls off the dabber, use a carb cap to cap that banger.
[08:42.980 --> 08:47.980]  That carb cap traps the air that's in there and it reduces the pressure inside
[08:48.540 --> 08:53.540]  that banger vessel and it reduces the airflow allowed to go over the hot oil to
[08:54.140 --> 08:56.220]  where when you pull air over that oil,
[08:57.340 --> 09:02.140]  that fresh air stokes the heat and makes your oil evaporate at a lower
[09:02.140 --> 09:05.380]  temperature. So you're not getting a super hot dab and it tastes better.
[09:05.620 --> 09:07.420]  So we let it cool, put the dab in there,
[09:07.420 --> 09:11.020]  put the carb cap on and keep hitting it and it tastes super good and you get a
[09:11.020 --> 09:14.420]  nice fat dab. Then when you're done, you got a little oil left in there.
[09:14.420 --> 09:17.540]  You get a Q-tip and you wipe that banger out and then you're pretty much good to
[09:17.540 --> 09:18.460]  go on another dab.
[09:19.380 --> 09:23.020]  Now here's where it branches off and gets different when we're doing insert
[09:23.020 --> 09:24.500]  dabs. I've got this.
[09:24.860 --> 09:28.060]  So I described the original banger as looking like a thimble.
[09:29.340 --> 09:32.460]  I've got another smaller thimble that fits right inside of here.
[09:32.500 --> 09:34.300]  I said that you could fit a diamond side of here.
[09:34.300 --> 09:38.780]  This thing's probably the size of like four dimes, five dimes deep,
[09:38.780 --> 09:41.740]  stacked up, maybe six dimes stacked up. It's just little,
[09:41.780 --> 09:43.020]  little tiny glass dish.
[09:43.820 --> 09:47.220]  Then you put your dab inside of there or the amount of concentrate that you wish
[09:47.220 --> 09:49.260]  to smoke inside of this little dish.
[09:49.580 --> 09:52.820]  I just scoop out like one good size crystal and drop a little crystal inside
[09:52.820 --> 09:56.980]  this dish. Then you heat the banger and that's, I, again,
[09:56.980 --> 10:00.060]  I heat it where the wall and the floor meet at the corner,
[10:00.060 --> 10:01.180]  the bottom corner of the nail.
[10:01.180 --> 10:03.620]  And I want that heat to move up all around the whole nail.
[10:04.420 --> 10:09.420]  I get it fairly hot because I need that radiant heat to heat this dab that is
[10:09.460 --> 10:11.660]  inside of the dish. So once it's heated,
[10:12.940 --> 10:17.940]  I carefully take this dish that's got my dab in it and I drop it right inside of
[10:17.980 --> 10:19.940]  this banger. I'll hold it by the mic and do it and you can hear it.
[10:19.940 --> 10:20.780]  This is what it sounds like.
[10:23.700 --> 10:26.020]  It's a little sticky, so it didn't slide as well as it should,
[10:26.340 --> 10:29.700]  but it just dropped right in there. So we'll say I heated it,
[10:29.940 --> 10:32.500]  heated the shit out of it till it's hot. Not orange hot,
[10:32.500 --> 10:35.820]  but just before orange hot. Drop that, uh,
[10:35.820 --> 10:38.740]  little insert in there with the dab in there, then set the carb cap on it.
[10:39.020 --> 10:42.220]  And then I wait, I just wait just a couple of seconds. Let's see.
[10:42.220 --> 10:44.020]  If I dropped it in here right now while it's hot, we'll say,
[10:44.060 --> 10:47.100]  don't drop it in there. And then we'll go ahead and put the carb cap on it.
[10:47.100 --> 10:49.580]  Boom. Carb cap is on. I would wait till about now.
[10:49.580 --> 10:53.540]  You would see the dab start reacting. Now the dab would really be bubbling.
[10:53.940 --> 10:57.060]  Now I would start hitting it. And now I'm getting,
[10:57.620 --> 11:01.700]  instead of taking that dab and pressing it up against the super hot surface and
[11:01.700 --> 11:03.700]  scorching it and making it cook right away,
[11:04.940 --> 11:07.940]  it is slowly coming to temperature where it can vaporize.
[11:08.180 --> 11:12.380]  I'm using that radiant heat of the outside glass to suck that heat through the
[11:12.380 --> 11:15.700]  carb cap over that dish inside there with the oil in it.
[11:16.020 --> 11:21.060]  And it brings that temperature up really slowly. And it makes that oil, uh,
[11:21.140 --> 11:25.420]  evaporate or vaporize at a much lower temperature.
[11:25.420 --> 11:29.180]  And it makes it taste so good. And it's,
[11:29.300 --> 11:31.220]  it slowly comes up to temperature where I can,
[11:31.220 --> 11:35.100]  it starts off with a kind of a thin thin vapor smoke dab, but it starts,
[11:35.100 --> 11:37.900]  as it goes, it gets to that thick smoke that I appreciate.
[11:38.260 --> 11:42.780]  And I've noticed there is very little waste since I'm not scorching the dab on
[11:42.780 --> 11:45.220]  that hot nail right away. There's hardly any waste.
[11:45.260 --> 11:48.180]  I am getting all of the dab that I put in this dish.
[11:48.500 --> 11:51.940]  So I'm getting a lower temperature dab because I'm starting to smoke it at its
[11:51.940 --> 11:55.380]  lowest vaporizing temperature. Right when it starts going, I start hitting it.
[11:55.380 --> 11:58.460]  I can see when it's bubbling inside that dish. So then I start hitting it.
[11:58.460 --> 12:01.780]  And I'm getting all those turps that normally would have been burned off when I
[12:01.780 --> 12:05.420]  pressed that dab against the hot banger. So I'm getting all those turps.
[12:05.420 --> 12:07.620]  And I'm also getting that fat chunky dab that I like.
[12:07.620 --> 12:08.820]  So it's like the best of both worlds.
[12:08.820 --> 12:12.340]  I'm getting the low temp flavor and I'm getting all the cannabinoids and I'm
[12:12.340 --> 12:16.140]  getting that fat thick smoke that I appreciate from my dab.
[12:16.140 --> 12:20.340]  So I heat it up and I drop that dish in there. I set the carb cap on it.
[12:20.380 --> 12:21.780]  I give it just long, you can watch it.
[12:21.820 --> 12:25.060]  You can see when the Earl just starts puddling in the middle of that dish.
[12:25.060 --> 12:26.940]  And it starts boiling up. That's when you want to hit it.
[12:27.340 --> 12:29.540]  And then spin that carb cap around and you can see it,
[12:29.540 --> 12:32.460]  move the oil around inside there and move it to the hotter spots and make it
[12:32.460 --> 12:35.100]  even out. And it makes a puddle less deep so it could burn better.
[12:35.540 --> 12:39.980]  But I really liked the way it brings it up to temperature instead of just right
[12:39.980 --> 12:42.100]  at temperature right away, it brings it up to the temp.
[12:42.100 --> 12:44.500]  And then it keeps going up because that heat's trapped in there.
[12:44.500 --> 12:47.700]  And as you smoke it, it's heating up that oil longer and hotter and hotter.
[12:48.300 --> 12:51.380]  And it, it makes it taste great. I got super lit off of it.
[12:51.620 --> 12:56.140]  And my banger isn't ridiculously dirty. All I've got to do now that it's cooled off.
[12:56.140 --> 12:58.940]  I can reach right inside of here. I can pull this little insert right out.
[12:59.180 --> 13:02.540]  Sometimes I'll drop this insert into a dish of alcohol. Uh,
[13:02.540 --> 13:05.380]  it's probably do about now after three or four good dads,
[13:05.380 --> 13:07.580]  I can't get it all the way clean. If I got a big thick dab,
[13:07.580 --> 13:09.940]  I can't get her all the way clean. I just drop it in a dish.
[13:09.940 --> 13:13.020]  I so let it sit for a couple of minutes and then I pull it out and use a paper
[13:13.020 --> 13:15.180]  towel and or a Q-tip just to polish it up a little bit.
[13:15.180 --> 13:16.420]  And then we're ready to take dabs again.
[13:17.060 --> 13:20.500]  So that's one way that I've been doing the insert dabs.
[13:21.300 --> 13:24.540]  Mike likes to take little tiny dabs. It might came over the other night.
[13:24.820 --> 13:25.660]  And I was like,
[13:25.660 --> 13:29.940]  if I take the dabber and wipe the dabber off into the dish that I was going to
[13:29.960 --> 13:32.940]  give Mike, there's not even enough concentrate in here.
[13:33.380 --> 13:35.380]  So it doesn't look like there's anything in here.
[13:35.380 --> 13:37.060]  And I don't know how this is going to work. It was just really,
[13:37.340 --> 13:39.380]  I'm not making fun of Mikey takes tiny dabs,
[13:39.380 --> 13:43.180]  but it didn't seem effective to do it that way. So I heated the banger.
[13:43.460 --> 13:47.140]  I threw the insert in there and then I put Mike's dab on the dabber and had him
[13:47.140 --> 13:51.900]  just dab that into the inside of the dish. Not, I told him not to hit that.
[13:51.900 --> 13:52.420]  He knew what to do.
[13:52.420 --> 13:55.260]  He knew to hit the inside of the dish and not the banger itself.
[13:55.940 --> 13:59.700]  And it made his dad burn. I could see it. It burned more smoothly. It didn't,
[14:00.460 --> 14:03.260]  it didn't flash. You know what I mean? It didn't just sit in the sand.
[14:03.300 --> 14:06.220]  It just melted nice and smoothly. And then he card cap it.
[14:06.220 --> 14:09.300]  And he got a nice dab and Mike kind of went pale and his eyes went a little
[14:09.300 --> 14:11.220]  glossy. It looked like marbles in his head for a minute.
[14:11.580 --> 14:15.220]  So that's another great way to utilize the insert. Then you let it cool.
[14:15.220 --> 14:16.980]  And once again, he just reach in there and pull it right out.
[14:16.980 --> 14:20.140]  And then your banger isn't dirty. You've got an insert that you can clean.
[14:20.420 --> 14:22.900]  If you've got a bunch of people that want to come dab in a group,
[14:22.900 --> 14:24.540]  maybe think about a couple of inserts.
[14:24.540 --> 14:27.780]  Cause the only time consuming part is really cleaning the inserts.
[14:27.900 --> 14:31.020]  So that's insert dabs. That's where we've gotten to.
[14:31.340 --> 14:34.660]  I really enjoy the insert dabs. I feel like it makes my dabs more efficient,
[14:34.700 --> 14:39.380]  more effective, uh, more flavorful. I really appreciate it. So once again,
[14:39.380 --> 14:40.700]  shout out to my friends at happy daddy,
[14:40.700 --> 14:45.100]  because I did not ask for an insert banger and an insert dab insert,
[14:45.180 --> 14:48.900]  but they hooked me up and I'm really glad they did. All right, you guys,
[14:48.900 --> 14:51.340]  I've been talking about dabs for like 10 minutes. So guess what?
[14:51.340 --> 14:53.900]  I'm going to press pause. I'm going to get a fresh bottle of water.
[14:53.900 --> 14:58.060]  I'm going to take about four fatty dabs and then we'll be back to do a podcast.
[14:58.100 --> 15:00.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for hanging out with me. All right,
[15:00.740 --> 15:01.940]  welcome back podcast world.
[15:01.940 --> 15:05.940]  I just took some dabs of some stuff called whammy bar nectar from green dot
[15:05.940 --> 15:08.820]  labs. The strains are lemon essence and papaya.
[15:09.100 --> 15:13.860]  The flavor is described as honeysuckle lemon candy and lemon candies.
[15:13.940 --> 15:16.940]  So if lemon candy wasn't enough, they threw in more lemon candies.
[15:17.260 --> 15:20.740]  I definitely got the honeysuckle flavor. The lemon was just hinted.
[15:20.980 --> 15:24.020]  It kind of reminded me of like a sweet girly tea.
[15:24.020 --> 15:27.780]  Like if you had a celestial seasonings tea that had sort of a honeysuckle hint
[15:27.780 --> 15:30.380]  to it, sort of a lemony sweetness to it.
[15:30.700 --> 15:34.640]  That's kind of what it reminded me of the high went straight to my face.
[15:34.660 --> 15:35.860]  I feel it in my eyes.
[15:36.140 --> 15:39.420]  It kind of feels like I'm wearing snowboard goggles or heavy sunglasses or
[15:39.420 --> 15:42.620]  something. Uh, they named the strain headband headband,
[15:42.620 --> 15:45.420]  because when they smoked it, they said it felt like they were wearing a headband.
[15:45.420 --> 15:46.700]  They had something around their head.
[15:47.260 --> 15:51.820]  They could totally rename this strain to like scuba goggles or snowboard goggles
[15:51.820 --> 15:55.580]  or 3d glasses or something like that. Cause it went right to my eyes.
[15:55.580 --> 15:59.380]  I felt it right in my face immediately. And the taste is delicious,
[15:59.380 --> 16:01.980]  great concentrates as always from green dot labs.
[16:01.980 --> 16:05.060]  And of course they do not pay me to say that I'm not sponsored by them by any
[16:05.060 --> 16:07.300]  way. I don't get any deals from anybody.
[16:07.300 --> 16:10.100]  I just really approve of this concentrate. So big shout out to them.
[16:10.340 --> 16:14.740]  And I like to let you guys know what I am smoking on a little look into my
[16:14.740 --> 16:18.380]  world. Speaking of a little look into my world,
[16:18.380 --> 16:22.940]  I was on Instagram live today and somebody gave me a thank you for the episode
[16:22.940 --> 16:23.620]  with Jesse.
[16:23.620 --> 16:27.700]  They said thanks for pulling back the curtain and letting us peek behind the
[16:27.700 --> 16:30.780]  curtain a little bit. They meant that we were talking about the industry.
[16:30.780 --> 16:33.900]  Jesse and I of course have been in the legal cannabis industry since its
[16:33.900 --> 16:35.340]  inception here in Colorado.
[16:35.540 --> 16:39.660]  So we were talking a lot about the legal cannabis industry and its evolution.
[16:39.820 --> 16:43.020]  So we had a listener say, thank you for peeling back the curtain. Hey dude,
[16:43.020 --> 16:45.340]  thank you again for listening. I do appreciate it.
[16:45.500 --> 16:49.940]  And I'm glad you guys enjoy the insight, sort of the view into our world.
[16:49.940 --> 16:53.780]  Sometimes I forget that you guys may be in a state that doesn't have legal
[16:53.780 --> 16:54.300]  cannabis,
[16:54.300 --> 16:58.180]  or you may not be able to find cannabis or concentrates and you are living
[16:58.180 --> 17:01.100]  vicariously through me. So I try to keep you guys updated.
[17:01.380 --> 17:04.060]  I try to keep you guys included and I try to have fun with you guys.
[17:04.060 --> 17:07.060]  So thanks for hanging out and I hope you enjoy the updates. You guys,
[17:07.060 --> 17:10.460]  I'm awful rambly after those dabs, but we are going to make this happen.
[17:10.700 --> 17:14.780]  To continue this flow, kind of segue into this. When Jesse was here,
[17:15.060 --> 17:16.820]  we really were having a good time.
[17:16.820 --> 17:21.380]  We got really into our conversations and there were a few things that I missed
[17:21.820 --> 17:25.780]  that I wanted to cover in that episode. So just real quickly,
[17:25.780 --> 17:29.420]  I want to recap a couple of things that I missed on the last episode.
[17:29.420 --> 17:33.620]  Of course, the last episode was based on a question. Somebody asked me,
[17:33.620 --> 17:38.020]  why is it so difficult to set up a grow indoors when it happens naturally by
[17:38.020 --> 17:39.900]  itself outdoors? Of course,
[17:39.900 --> 17:42.540]  Jesse and I had a lot of information to give on that.
[17:42.860 --> 17:46.660]  My main piece of advice was it doesn't just happen naturally outdoors.
[17:46.660 --> 17:48.980]  It may look like it because you don't see us out there all day,
[17:49.220 --> 17:52.060]  but when the sun comes up, we're already out there watering,
[17:52.100 --> 17:54.220]  we're doing any defoliation that needs to be done.
[17:54.220 --> 17:57.460]  We're taking care of the garden before the peak of the sun in the middle of the
[17:57.460 --> 17:58.860]  day, or at least we're trying to.
[17:59.100 --> 18:01.740]  So there's a lot of shit to be done out outdoors and outdoor growing.
[18:01.740 --> 18:04.540]  It doesn't just happen. You could throw some clones out there,
[18:04.540 --> 18:06.820]  some seeds out there and hope at the end of the year you get a crop.
[18:07.540 --> 18:08.940]  But if you want a high quality garden,
[18:08.940 --> 18:11.580]  you need to be out there every day taking care of those plants,
[18:11.580 --> 18:14.420]  making sure there's no pests, there's no problems. You have to defoliate,
[18:14.420 --> 18:16.420]  you have to do pruning, you have to do lollipopping,
[18:16.420 --> 18:19.740]  you have to do popping and twisting and cracking. There's so much to be done.
[18:19.940 --> 18:21.500]  So that was my first point.
[18:21.940 --> 18:25.380]  Then here are a couple of things that I missed.
[18:26.140 --> 18:29.220]  So growing indoors, all of the pests that are there,
[18:29.220 --> 18:31.500]  all of the bugs that are there were brought in by you,
[18:31.580 --> 18:33.300]  either on your clothes, on your shoes,
[18:33.620 --> 18:36.060]  or in another plant that you brought into the grow.
[18:36.060 --> 18:39.500]  If you brought clones home from a dispensary or from a friend,
[18:39.700 --> 18:40.700]  those pests came there.
[18:40.740 --> 18:44.060]  Now there's nothing there to combat those pests because you only brought in
[18:44.060 --> 18:48.460]  those pests. Outdoors, if you get a small spider, spider mite infestation,
[18:49.060 --> 18:52.580]  something outside will come along and eat those spider mites and run them off.
[18:52.900 --> 18:53.860]  And then in a couple of days,
[18:54.020 --> 18:56.660]  something's going to come along and eat those and run them off.
[18:57.020 --> 18:59.180]  Outside is always competing for territory.
[18:59.180 --> 19:03.620]  So you're not going to get as troublesome and massive bug
[19:03.620 --> 19:05.500]  infestations as you are indoors,
[19:05.660 --> 19:07.540]  because you're going to have some sort of a balance.
[19:07.540 --> 19:12.460]  So outdoors has balance and a lot of that balance is what makes it so
[19:12.460 --> 19:15.340]  much easier to grow out there. Like I said, in the other episode,
[19:15.340 --> 19:17.220]  every time you add a piece of equipment indoors,
[19:17.220 --> 19:20.620]  you have to add another piece of equipment to combat something that it does.
[19:20.620 --> 19:22.540]  It's got a side effect. That's not desirable.
[19:22.780 --> 19:26.220]  Now you need another piece of equipment and that piece of equipment has another
[19:26.220 --> 19:28.420]  side effect. You add a light, it gets hot in the room.
[19:28.420 --> 19:32.260]  You put an air conditioner in there. Now it's going to get too humid or too dry.
[19:32.500 --> 19:34.820]  So you're going to have to add either a humidifier or a dehumidifier.
[19:34.820 --> 19:35.980]  Now you're going to have runoff water.
[19:35.980 --> 19:37.420]  You're gonna have to do something with that water.
[19:37.740 --> 19:40.660]  It's just a whole bunch of more things to add. Every time you think about it,
[19:40.900 --> 19:43.900]  if you want to run CO2, you need to rethink your whole ventilation system.
[19:44.180 --> 19:46.300]  It's just every time you add something, there's more to think about.
[19:46.300 --> 19:48.220]  I'm going to keep going with the stuff that we missed.
[19:48.660 --> 19:52.660]  Outdoors is naturally vented. We don't need to supplement CO2.
[19:53.060 --> 19:55.420]  We can't add an air conditioner. You can't add a heater.
[19:55.580 --> 19:58.740]  Outdoors is doing what it does. It may be too hot,
[19:58.980 --> 20:03.260]  but the plants can adjust because they're not trapped in that room with no fresh
[20:03.260 --> 20:05.860]  air. It is hot, but it is fresh hot air.
[20:06.060 --> 20:08.980]  There's the proper amount of CO2 in there. The plants,
[20:09.140 --> 20:10.860]  there's wind and airflow.
[20:10.860 --> 20:14.060]  The plants aren't just sucking up that stale moist water that's coming up from
[20:14.060 --> 20:17.860]  the pots. When you water, all that water goes into the soil. It gets warm.
[20:18.020 --> 20:19.980]  That water starts evaporating up out of the soil.
[20:20.180 --> 20:23.260]  That moist air goes up all around your plants. You're just in there sucking up.
[20:23.260 --> 20:25.420]  They're in the sauna all day. Outdoors,
[20:25.620 --> 20:28.580]  they can kind of regulate because they're outdoors. They've got fresh air.
[20:28.580 --> 20:31.460]  It's not just that same stagnant air all day.
[20:31.460 --> 20:33.180]  So it's naturally vented outside.
[20:33.580 --> 20:36.940]  So we've talked about the pest balance and we've talked about the natural
[20:37.100 --> 20:40.140]  ventilation, the natural CO2, the natural wind.
[20:40.140 --> 20:45.060]  It's not trapped in there breathing that same funky stagnant air.
[20:45.220 --> 20:49.780]  Now let's talk about the main factor that contributes to amazing outdoor
[20:49.820 --> 20:54.820]  cannabis. The sun, you guys, the sun is everything. Without sun,
[20:55.060 --> 20:58.580]  nothing lives. Nothing exists without the sun.
[20:58.580 --> 20:59.740]  We could go for a little while,
[21:00.100 --> 21:03.180]  but everything would go to shit on earth without the sun.
[21:03.620 --> 21:08.260]  So the sun is the strongest, most powerful resource for the plants.
[21:08.260 --> 21:12.940]  The sun is the main nutrient. The plants want light more than anything.
[21:12.940 --> 21:15.500]  That is the number one nutrient ingredient.
[21:15.540 --> 21:18.460]  The number one thing that your plants want is light.
[21:18.460 --> 21:22.780]  The more light you give them, the more energy they have to grow.
[21:22.780 --> 21:25.740]  The thicker the stocks can get, the happier the leaves can get,
[21:26.060 --> 21:28.020]  which means the fatter your buds are going to get.
[21:28.500 --> 21:32.140]  And what's the best source of light you can imagine? It is the sun.
[21:32.340 --> 21:35.500]  You can take your lumen meter and you can put it outside in the sun and it's
[21:35.500 --> 21:36.340]  going to max out.
[21:36.540 --> 21:40.260]  You can carry your lumen meter over to a shady spot and it's still so sunny
[21:40.260 --> 21:43.180]  outside that it's not going to matter. That's how much sun is outside.
[21:43.620 --> 21:47.300]  You can move your lumen meter a couple of inches away from a grow light and
[21:47.300 --> 21:50.260]  it's going to show differences. That's how strong the sun is.
[21:50.580 --> 21:55.460]  The sun gives those plants extra energy to fight any
[21:55.460 --> 21:58.580]  problems that they may have. If they've got some bugs attacking them,
[21:58.700 --> 22:02.980]  they're not as weak as the indoor plants that have been getting fed led lighting
[22:03.100 --> 22:05.460]  or even high pressure sodium lighting.
[22:05.780 --> 22:08.980]  You've got to turn into electricity and shoot down some wires and then send it
[22:08.980 --> 22:11.620]  to this bulb and hope that that bulb gives it enough energy to live.
[22:11.860 --> 22:15.260]  It does work. It's working just fine, but it is not comparable to the sun.
[22:15.540 --> 22:18.700]  The sun is like putting it on performance enhancing drugs.
[22:18.940 --> 22:21.860]  The sun is what makes everything live. You guys, all of us,
[22:21.860 --> 22:23.820]  there are cultures that worship the sun.
[22:24.380 --> 22:26.540]  So when you put those plants outdoors,
[22:26.700 --> 22:29.740]  if they're getting a little bug infestation, first off,
[22:30.220 --> 22:33.100]  the other bugs are going to come and fight them off. If you've got spider mites,
[22:33.100 --> 22:34.660]  some other bugs is going to go, Oh, Hey bro,
[22:34.660 --> 22:36.180]  there's a bunch of little spider mites over here.
[22:36.180 --> 22:37.020]  Let's go eat them all.
[22:37.220 --> 22:40.140]  All those other bugs are going to go eat those and hopefully those bugs don't
[22:40.140 --> 22:42.460]  eat your plants. But if they do, you know what? Some other bugs is going to go,
[22:42.780 --> 22:44.420]  Hey bro, there's a bunch of these bugs over here.
[22:44.420 --> 22:45.940]  Looking like a bunch of bitches. Let's go eat them.
[22:45.940 --> 22:47.300]  And those bugs are going to go eat those.
[22:47.620 --> 22:49.540]  And then they're going to get bored and they're going to ramble on and look for
[22:49.540 --> 22:52.020]  more bugs to eat. So the first thing that's going to happen,
[22:52.020 --> 22:53.500]  the bugs are going to eat them. Second of all,
[22:53.540 --> 22:56.700]  they're going to be much more healthy because they're outdoor plants.
[22:56.700 --> 22:57.940]  They are getting the sunshine.
[22:58.260 --> 23:01.060]  How much healthier do you feel when you go spend a day outside?
[23:01.380 --> 23:03.740]  If you're not feeling good, if you've got a runny nose, if you've got a cold,
[23:03.740 --> 23:04.580]  if you're sneezing,
[23:04.580 --> 23:07.180]  you can just go sit in the sunshine for a little while and it will cook that
[23:07.180 --> 23:08.660]  shit out of you and you will feel better.
[23:08.940 --> 23:11.780]  How often have you been bummed out and depressed or pissed off?
[23:11.900 --> 23:13.820]  You just go lean against the tree and sit in the sunshine.
[23:14.140 --> 23:16.900]  You feel better. The sun is fucking magic, you guys.
[23:17.140 --> 23:21.140]  So it makes the plants stronger. It gives them a better self-defense.
[23:21.140 --> 23:24.660]  It makes them healthier overall. So that is one aspect of the sun.
[23:25.340 --> 23:29.820]  Now another aspect is photosynthesis heavily increases with all that natural
[23:29.820 --> 23:32.860]  sunlight. There's every ray that this plants want.
[23:32.860 --> 23:35.420]  Everything they naturally think they should get is happening.
[23:35.420 --> 23:36.980]  They're not missing a certain spectrum.
[23:37.220 --> 23:39.180]  So they are able to grow more appropriately.
[23:39.180 --> 23:42.740]  They can uptake their nutrients more properly. They can eat more.
[23:42.980 --> 23:45.620]  You can feed them more because they perform stronger.
[23:45.820 --> 23:49.660]  It's like you've got Hussein Bolt out there just fucking running as fast as you
[23:49.660 --> 23:50.580]  can. Of course,
[23:50.580 --> 23:53.300]  he's going to need to eat a little bit more than my scrawny ass who's sitting
[23:53.300 --> 23:56.380]  here at the fucking table all day. I would be an indoor grow plant.
[23:56.580 --> 23:58.580]  Hussein Bolt would be an outdoor grow plant.
[23:58.780 --> 24:01.260]  Maybe we should say LeBron James is probably more, uh,
[24:01.580 --> 24:03.460]  more applicable today.
[24:05.060 --> 24:10.020]  LeBron is a fucking outdoor fucking hybrid vigor, fucking ganja plant.
[24:10.020 --> 24:13.340]  I'm an indoor fucking, yeah, I'm just an indoor plant.
[24:13.340 --> 24:17.460]  And you can see the difference, right? Uh, LeBron will push me down and dunk on me.
[24:17.860 --> 24:21.860]  I would ask him for the ball so I could maybe have a chance to play. That's so,
[24:22.100 --> 24:24.300]  the outdoor plants are getting those sunshine rays.
[24:24.500 --> 24:27.380]  They're getting so much stronger. They're way healthier.
[24:27.740 --> 24:31.820]  They're able to process their nutrients better. They're getting fresh air.
[24:32.060 --> 24:33.660]  They're getting all the cycles.
[24:33.660 --> 24:36.540]  They're a little tougher because how tough would you be if you had to sit out
[24:36.540 --> 24:39.620]  there and fucking deal with the morning dew every morning, just getting all over.
[24:39.620 --> 24:42.380]  You just all cold and funky and moist. Like, God damn it. I'm cold.
[24:42.380 --> 24:43.460]  There ain't shit I can do about it.
[24:43.740 --> 24:46.340]  And then the sun starts coming up and you just start getting hot and you're just
[24:46.340 --> 24:48.620]  getting cooked. You're like, fuck, I'm just getting roasted now.
[24:48.620 --> 24:51.180]  I wish the fucking morning dew drops had come back.
[24:51.540 --> 24:54.820]  And then the wind comes and starts bending you over and whipping your ass.
[24:55.180 --> 24:59.060]  And then probably like a squirrel climbed up you or something or a goat peed on
[24:59.080 --> 25:02.180]  you. And then as the day went on, it got hot as fuck.
[25:02.180 --> 25:04.420]  And then the sun started going down and it got real windy.
[25:04.420 --> 25:06.540]  And then it got kind of cold to where you wish as a plant,
[25:06.540 --> 25:09.460]  you wish you could go get a little plant hoodie because it's kind of chilly out
[25:09.460 --> 25:10.060]  there,
[25:10.060 --> 25:14.180]  but that makes those plants that much stronger and that much more robust and
[25:14.200 --> 25:18.140]  that much more vigorous. So the sun and the outdoor just nature,
[25:18.260 --> 25:21.100]  just makes everything a little bit stronger.
[25:21.220 --> 25:24.620]  So I wouldn't say it makes it easier, but it definitely is a corrector.
[25:24.620 --> 25:26.140]  If you make mistakes outdoors,
[25:26.160 --> 25:29.900]  the sunshine will have so much more forgiveness for you.
[25:30.100 --> 25:32.700]  The sunshine will help you out. If you've got a plant with problems,
[25:32.900 --> 25:35.620]  that sun, just like a human depressed or sick human,
[25:35.900 --> 25:40.140]  the sunshine will be a turbo boost to heal you and your plants.
[25:41.060 --> 25:43.380]  So that's mainly what I wanted to add when Jesse was here.
[25:43.400 --> 25:45.980]  I did not think to rant on how important the sun was.
[25:46.000 --> 25:48.840]  We had a lot of things going on. Like I said earlier, you guys,
[25:48.840 --> 25:51.300]  there are cultures that worship the sun.
[25:51.500 --> 25:54.820]  Our entire solar system spins around the sun.
[25:54.980 --> 25:56.540]  So it's gotta be doing something, right?
[25:56.740 --> 25:59.300]  It's gotta do something special to the plants and you can see it.
[25:59.620 --> 26:02.660]  That's why outdoor growing is completely different than indoor growing.
[26:02.680 --> 26:05.420]  Also you have to deal with that sun while you're out there.
[26:05.660 --> 26:08.420]  In an indoor grow environment, it's like 77 degrees.
[26:08.460 --> 26:10.940]  I got the air conditioner blowing. If it gets too hot in there,
[26:11.500 --> 26:14.660]  I can just not be in there for a few minutes. If you're in the outdoor grow,
[26:14.940 --> 26:18.540]  you're in the outdoor growth. It's 107 degrees outside. Guess what? It's 107.
[26:18.740 --> 26:19.740]  Good luck deal with it.
[26:19.860 --> 26:23.500]  So that's the downfall to the outdoor growing is you've got to be out there
[26:23.500 --> 26:24.340]  also.
[26:24.580 --> 26:27.740]  So I'm not going to end or say anything about the potency or the quality or the
[26:27.740 --> 26:29.660]  difference on which is better indoor or outdoor.
[26:29.680 --> 26:31.940]  That's still going to be another debate for another episode,
[26:32.180 --> 26:36.980]  but I wanted to add some of the things I left on why it's so
[26:36.980 --> 26:40.940]  challenging indoors when it just happens naturally outdoors.
[26:42.100 --> 26:45.940]  Now that I feel like I got that caught up, let's read an email from a listener.
[26:45.940 --> 26:48.060]  It doesn't say if they want me to say their name.
[26:48.180 --> 26:51.500]  So I'm going to get right into the email. It goes like this.
[26:51.500 --> 26:54.300]  Thanks for all of your help. I've learned so much from your podcast.
[26:54.580 --> 26:58.100]  It's nice to get some useful info after all these years of secrecy.
[26:58.380 --> 27:01.220]  I want to let you know that I really enjoy the throwback Thursdays.
[27:01.260 --> 27:02.860]  I can listen to you all day.
[27:03.060 --> 27:05.700]  It's like I'm there with you guys laughing and having a good time.
[27:06.060 --> 27:10.420]  Big shout out to you and all of your great guests. Hey dude,
[27:10.660 --> 27:11.620]  you are very welcome.
[27:11.620 --> 27:15.500]  Thank you for the great email and I'm glad you were learning from us and thanks
[27:15.500 --> 27:18.540]  for listening to those Thursday episodes because that was a lot of work to put
[27:18.560 --> 27:22.280]  those together. So I'm glad you appreciate those. And man, you are a crazy dude.
[27:22.280 --> 27:27.040]  If you think you could listen to me all day, that's pretty intense. Anyway,
[27:27.040 --> 27:28.300]  dude, thanks for the great message.
[27:28.700 --> 27:30.820]  He says big shout out to you and all of your guests.
[27:30.820 --> 27:33.260]  Then he also says okay enough ass kissing.
[27:33.500 --> 27:37.340]  So I've been a gardener for a while now and it still bothers me when it's time
[27:37.360 --> 27:38.620]  to cut them down.
[27:39.380 --> 27:41.900]  So it sounds like this guy has been growing cannabis for quite a while,
[27:42.180 --> 27:44.740]  but when it's harvest time, it still bothers him.
[27:44.740 --> 27:48.060]  He's got a little emotional attachment. He continues the email with,
[27:48.260 --> 27:51.660]  I was wondering if it gets easier in a big grow when you have to cut down
[27:51.680 --> 27:54.980]  hundreds or do you still have that special connection to them?
[27:55.380 --> 27:57.740]  I just don't think I would enjoy working in a big grow.
[27:57.740 --> 28:01.540]  It seems like it's more about production than caring and nurturing a life.
[28:01.860 --> 28:05.980]  I know you really care for the plants. So what is your harvest day like? Again,
[28:06.180 --> 28:10.260]  thanks for the great podcast and all of your help. Take a fat ass dab for me,
[28:10.260 --> 28:13.860]  bro. He didn't even sign it. It just says from my iPad. So, hey dude,
[28:13.860 --> 28:16.980]  thanks for the great email. If anybody out there would like to send me an email,
[28:17.220 --> 28:20.740]  my email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[28:21.540 --> 28:25.700]  You know, I'd love to hear from you. Now let's answer some of this question.
[28:26.300 --> 28:26.620]  He said,
[28:26.620 --> 28:30.300]  does it get easier when you have to cut down hundreds or do you still have that
[28:30.300 --> 28:32.460]  special connection with them? You know,
[28:32.460 --> 28:35.940]  the first time it was kind of intimidating to cut down a giant room.
[28:35.940 --> 28:40.860]  We cut down 42 lights worth of plants. I don't even remember the exact number.
[28:41.060 --> 28:43.180]  It was close to 75 pounds of product.
[28:43.820 --> 28:48.220]  That was my first harvest in that facility. It was a little intimidating,
[28:48.240 --> 28:51.860]  but I don't know that I had some sort of like, Oh no,
[28:51.860 --> 28:53.900]  they're cutting down my children. I think I understand.
[28:53.900 --> 28:57.380]  I've grown for so long that I understand that's the process. Now,
[28:57.500 --> 28:59.300]  the commercial grow, you're kind of right.
[28:59.320 --> 29:02.340]  It is about production at the commercial grow. Uh,
[29:02.360 --> 29:05.020]  it's all about cutting them down, cleaning the room,
[29:05.060 --> 29:08.380]  putting more plants in there, getting those plants to the dry and cure room,
[29:08.380 --> 29:11.460]  paying attention to them every day so that we can get them trimmed and dried and
[29:11.480 --> 29:16.180]  ready to go to the patients. Now that's where you get to see the reward.
[29:16.200 --> 29:19.180]  So the, that weird feeling you have of cutting them down,
[29:19.460 --> 29:24.380]  just think of that as one step closer to somebody with cancer or
[29:24.400 --> 29:27.940]  seizures being that much closer to feeling better.
[29:28.100 --> 29:30.820]  So that's a way to kind of offset that weird, uh,
[29:30.860 --> 29:32.520]  cutting down your baby sort of feeling.
[29:32.740 --> 29:35.220]  I don't think I have that feeling in the commercial grows anymore.
[29:35.460 --> 29:37.380]  Now it's like, uh, we've got a lot to do.
[29:37.380 --> 29:41.460]  Let's get in here and get it done. And we've got a big team that, uh,
[29:42.020 --> 29:44.620]  so we got a guy going through, there's three layers of trellis netting.
[29:44.620 --> 29:47.020]  We got a guy that goes through and cuts the two bottom layers off.
[29:47.020 --> 29:49.300]  Never cut that top layer off because it goes all crazy.
[29:49.500 --> 29:51.420]  He'll go through and clean out the two bottom layers of net.
[29:51.420 --> 29:54.640]  And then we got a guy that comes through and cuts the plants at the base.
[29:54.640 --> 29:57.380]  And then we got another guy that'll come through and pull those plants out of
[29:57.380 --> 30:01.060]  that net and then get them onto a tray or onto like a little cart.
[30:01.060 --> 30:03.500]  And then that little cart gets a bunch of plants and it gets wheeled over to the
[30:03.500 --> 30:05.740]  scale. There's a guy weighing each plant,
[30:05.740 --> 30:10.220]  shouting out numbers to either Mike or Ernie, excuse me for the throat clearing.
[30:10.240 --> 30:12.740]  I apologize. That guy shouts out numbers to Mike or Ernie.
[30:12.740 --> 30:14.980]  Mike and Ernie put those numbers into a spreadsheet.
[30:15.220 --> 30:17.100]  Then that plant gets moved to a whole nother area,
[30:17.100 --> 30:19.980]  the dry and cure area or those guys hanging on the dry and cure line.
[30:20.340 --> 30:24.780]  So it is a conveyor belt process at harvest time in a big production
[30:25.060 --> 30:27.220]  facility. Um, you're right.
[30:27.220 --> 30:31.260]  You may not be satisfied or enjoying working in a big grow.
[30:31.440 --> 30:36.340]  It's not meant to be like a craft sort of a hobby grow. It is something,
[30:36.340 --> 30:40.180]  it is a production facility. So, and you're right, it is more about production,
[30:40.620 --> 30:44.660]  but it is all about nurturing and caring for a life. We touch every single plant.
[30:45.100 --> 30:47.980]  We defoliate each plant. We lollipop each plant.
[30:47.980 --> 30:52.380]  We crack every branch of the plant. So there is a lot of love put into them.
[30:53.220 --> 30:57.020]  It is just done more quickly and more methodically.
[30:57.020 --> 31:00.740]  You don't put on your favorite podcast and kind of relax and get stoned and
[31:01.100 --> 31:03.180]  listen to Rogan and pop these plants.
[31:03.180 --> 31:06.380]  You got Rogan in the headphones or in the earbuds or whatever you're rocking,
[31:06.420 --> 31:08.740]  but you're just cracking plants and moving. It's kind of,
[31:08.740 --> 31:12.420]  it is more of a high pace sort of a production thing. You got to go fast.
[31:13.380 --> 31:16.220]  The pace you work in a home grow and Jesse even said it on an episode,
[31:16.500 --> 31:19.700]  the pace you work in a home grow would not pay the bills in a commercial
[31:19.700 --> 31:23.620]  facility. So it is a way different sort of a thing. Your question says,
[31:23.620 --> 31:26.420]  I know you really care for the plants. So what is your harvest day like?
[31:26.420 --> 31:30.620]  I just told you that it's kind of like Jason and Freddie going in there and just
[31:30.620 --> 31:33.340]  destroying shit. But on the same token,
[31:34.340 --> 31:37.740]  I also have a private grow a personal grow with six plants.
[31:37.980 --> 31:40.780]  I've got six in flower and six in veg because it's Colorado.
[31:40.980 --> 31:43.540]  I'm allowed 12 plants with my medical marijuana card.
[31:43.980 --> 31:45.540]  So I've got a very small garden.
[31:45.580 --> 31:50.580]  That's the garden where I put on Joey Diaz or Joe Rogan or Doug loves movies or
[31:52.780 --> 31:54.220]  Tad Hussey's podcast.
[31:54.700 --> 31:57.620]  And I'll put on one of those shows and I'll get my earbuds in and I'll get nice
[31:57.640 --> 31:59.780]  and baked and I'll go play with the plants.
[31:59.780 --> 32:04.660]  And those are the plants that I get to really love and care for and nurture a
[32:04.660 --> 32:08.660]  little more personally. Like I do love all the plants in the large facility,
[32:09.060 --> 32:12.820]  but there's a lot of them and you can't, you can't, we'll remember, Hey,
[32:12.980 --> 32:16.620]  did you check that one plant over in row three that just keeps being a bitch?
[32:16.620 --> 32:19.820]  We know we can identify, we'll have a relationship with one plant if it's
[32:19.820 --> 32:22.380]  standing out. But in my home grow,
[32:22.700 --> 32:26.660]  I can tell you which plant is in each room and in which position.
[32:26.660 --> 32:30.140]  So if they're in the flowering room, there are six pots under one light.
[32:30.380 --> 32:33.020]  I could tell you if I numbered them one, two, three, four, five, six,
[32:33.020 --> 32:34.500]  I could tell you which plant is which.
[32:34.780 --> 32:38.300]  Like I know that King Solomon is number four because he's the first one in that
[32:38.300 --> 32:39.860]  front row. And then, uh,
[32:40.380 --> 32:42.940]  I don't even want to tell you that Clementine is in there and Clementine is
[32:42.960 --> 32:44.860]  about to get pollinated by King Solomon.
[32:44.860 --> 32:47.700]  And there's a few other really cool things in there, but yeah,
[32:47.700 --> 32:51.340]  I got another breeding project going on and I can tell you each plant that is in
[32:51.360 --> 32:53.860]  there and I can tell you like what has gone on with it.
[32:53.900 --> 32:57.460]  And when I cracked the sticks on it and everything that it's been fed.
[32:57.480 --> 33:00.860]  So there is a huge difference between the commercial grow and the personal grow.
[33:00.860 --> 33:04.420]  I've got a different relationship with the commercial grow and the personal grow.
[33:04.900 --> 33:06.420]  It's like being in two different bands.
[33:06.420 --> 33:08.900]  It's like being in a death metal band where all night long,
[33:08.920 --> 33:12.380]  I've got to be just my feet are going and I'm intense. And if I miss one beat,
[33:12.380 --> 33:15.220]  it's all fucked. And you just got to be going lightning fast and killing it.
[33:15.620 --> 33:16.660]  That's the commercial grow.
[33:16.980 --> 33:20.220]  Then I guess I got a reggae band for my home grow where it's chill.
[33:20.460 --> 33:22.100]  We're going to get the songs are going to sound good.
[33:22.100 --> 33:24.060]  We're going to relax and everyone's going to have a good time.
[33:24.060 --> 33:26.180]  And what needs to happen will happen. Like it's,
[33:26.300 --> 33:28.340]  it's like being in two totally different bands.
[33:28.340 --> 33:30.460]  It's like having two totally different relationships.
[33:30.780 --> 33:33.900]  It's like the difference between being in a hugely successful band that plays
[33:33.900 --> 33:37.220]  the Pepsi center or being in a band that plays like the black sheep.
[33:37.300 --> 33:41.900]  It's a totally different environment. I love those big Pepsi center gigs.
[33:42.100 --> 33:43.740]  It's a lot of fun. It's a lot of challenging.
[33:43.740 --> 33:45.820]  I like the sweat and the challenge of,
[33:45.820 --> 33:48.340]  are we going to get this done and we got to go a hundred miles an hour.
[33:48.580 --> 33:49.420]  But at the same time,
[33:49.420 --> 33:52.780]  you also enjoy those little black sheep gigs where you know everybody in the
[33:52.780 --> 33:56.100]  audience and you can see the whole crowd and you just get to smile and relax a
[33:56.100 --> 33:57.980]  little bit. So I love them both,
[33:58.420 --> 34:03.260]  but I try not to get too personally attached to the plants in the commercial
[34:03.580 --> 34:03.780]  grow.
[34:03.780 --> 34:06.700]  One of the hard things is when we decide to get rid of a cultivar at the
[34:06.700 --> 34:09.420]  commercial grow, we'll be like, so we've been looking at the numbers,
[34:09.420 --> 34:11.180]  and this cut doesn't produce very much,
[34:11.940 --> 34:15.580]  or maybe it's not reaching up to a lab testing expectations or something like
[34:15.580 --> 34:17.180]  that. So we'll end up getting rid of a cut.
[34:17.620 --> 34:20.340]  And sometimes that hurts my feelings because sometimes I really like them.
[34:20.380 --> 34:23.140]  But other than that, I try not to get too attached.
[34:23.380 --> 34:26.380]  I do get really excited when we get new stuff in a commercial grow though.
[34:26.380 --> 34:28.700]  If we've been running the same genetics and you're like, Hey,
[34:28.700 --> 34:31.260]  we just got blueberry cookies. I'm like, Oh yeah.
[34:31.380 --> 34:32.780]  That kind of stuff does get me excited,
[34:32.780 --> 34:36.380]  but I try not to get too personally attached to the commercial grow.
[34:36.580 --> 34:40.900]  I try to keep in mind that that is business. And then I keep the home grow,
[34:40.900 --> 34:44.780]  the personal grow more like the one that I'm kind of more intimate and personal
[34:44.780 --> 34:47.940]  with. So dude, thanks for the great email. You are right.
[34:47.940 --> 34:52.140]  You may not enjoy working in a commercial growing facility,
[34:52.140 --> 34:56.300]  but you may learn a lot of things that you could take home and implement into
[34:56.300 --> 34:59.700]  your home grow that would make you more efficient and more productive and more
[34:59.700 --> 35:02.420]  cost-effective. So it may be worth the trade off.
[35:02.700 --> 35:05.340]  And also it's something you've got experience in. So you may not hate it.
[35:05.340 --> 35:08.220]  It may be fun. It may be value, valuable for you.
[35:08.540 --> 35:12.340]  And it will also make you appreciate that home grow a little bit more. Hey dude,
[35:12.340 --> 35:15.260]  thanks for the great email. He signed the email with again,
