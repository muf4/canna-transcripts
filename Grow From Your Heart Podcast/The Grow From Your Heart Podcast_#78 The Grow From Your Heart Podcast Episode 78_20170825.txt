[00:11.710 --> 00:21.070]  Oh my god, that was the best.
[00:21.070 --> 00:22.070]  Thank you.
[00:22.070 --> 00:23.070]  Do the rest.
[00:23.070 --> 00:24.070]  Keep going, dude.
[00:24.070 --> 00:25.070]  I don't listen to them.
[00:25.070 --> 00:26.070]  You don't know the intro?
[00:26.070 --> 00:27.070]  I'll be honest with you.
[00:27.070 --> 00:28.070]  Oh man.
[00:28.070 --> 00:31.830]  I come on and then it's hard to listen to the rest because you're a grower.
[00:31.830 --> 00:33.350]  I'm going to, oh, I see.
[00:33.350 --> 00:36.950]  Hey, all you guys that are growers and stuff, it's Clint.
[00:36.950 --> 00:37.950]  I'm back.
[00:37.950 --> 00:39.390]  This is going to be a crazy episode.
[00:39.390 --> 00:40.390]  I can already tell.
[00:40.390 --> 00:41.390]  Yeah.
[00:41.390 --> 00:44.070]  You're going to be here for 78 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast?
[00:44.070 --> 00:45.070]  Yes.
[00:45.070 --> 00:46.070]  Yeah.
[00:46.070 --> 00:47.070]  78.
[00:47.070 --> 00:49.830]  We're going to skip the intro because Clint already crashed the whole fucking party and
[00:49.830 --> 00:50.830]  I like it.
[00:50.830 --> 00:51.830]  Damn straight.
[00:51.830 --> 00:54.910]  You said we might have one mishap at the start and I was like, it's going to be a good mishap
[00:54.910 --> 00:55.910]  then.
[00:55.910 --> 00:58.630]  I'm going to make it 100%.
[00:58.630 --> 01:01.390]  You wouldn't believe how many false starts I've had on this podcast when I'm recording
[01:01.390 --> 01:02.390]  by myself.
[01:02.390 --> 01:05.230]  It seems like I have a really hard time busting out the intro when I'm alone, but when there
[01:05.230 --> 01:06.990]  are people here, it flows out like nothing.
[01:06.990 --> 01:09.190]  Yeah, like this time you did a real good job.
[01:09.190 --> 01:10.190]  I did.
[01:10.190 --> 01:11.190]  Thanks.
[01:11.990 --> 01:12.990]  You got the word.
[01:12.990 --> 01:15.550]  Man, you got everything you wanted to say out.
[01:15.550 --> 01:18.990]  I should have just turned your microphone down and just kept you down until I introduced
[01:18.990 --> 01:20.390]  you, but I just kept yelling.
[01:20.390 --> 01:21.390]  I'm sure you would have.
[01:21.390 --> 01:22.390]  I just got even louder.
[01:22.390 --> 01:23.390]  So ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.
[01:23.390 --> 01:25.310]  Joining me today is my friend Clint.
[01:25.310 --> 01:26.310]  He's a local comedian.
[01:26.310 --> 01:27.830]  At least that's what he claims to be.
[01:27.830 --> 01:29.390]  You've already seen his skills.
[01:29.390 --> 01:30.390]  Yeah.
[01:30.390 --> 01:32.150]  It's fun, dude.
[01:32.150 --> 01:34.990]  Clint is an amateur pot smoker.
[01:34.990 --> 01:39.350]  He usually takes two puffs of sour diesel and today he took three.
[01:39.350 --> 01:40.350]  Did I?
[01:40.510 --> 01:45.230]  It's still undecided because I can't remember if I took two or three.
[01:45.230 --> 01:47.750]  I hope he took three because you were fucking higher than usual.
[01:47.750 --> 01:48.750]  Yeah, dude.
[01:48.750 --> 01:49.750]  It's super fun.
[01:49.750 --> 01:50.750]  Nice.
[01:50.750 --> 01:51.750]  You okay?
[01:51.750 --> 01:52.750]  You gonna be good?
[01:52.750 --> 01:53.750]  No, dude.
[01:53.750 --> 01:54.750]  Now we're here right now with all these people.
[01:54.750 --> 01:55.750]  This is fucking awesome.
[01:55.750 --> 01:56.750]  All these people.
[01:56.750 --> 01:57.750]  You mean all the people that are listening, right?
[01:57.750 --> 01:58.750]  Yeah.
[01:58.750 --> 01:59.750]  You don't think there are more people here, do you?
[01:59.750 --> 02:00.750]  Well, it's just the ones behind you, but.
[02:00.750 --> 02:04.430]  All right, you guys, you can already tell what kind of episode this is going to be.
[02:04.430 --> 02:08.150]  I do need to send a huge thank you shout out to Kat and Koot from the Mystic Roots Band.
[02:08.150 --> 02:09.550]  They let me play their music on the show.
[02:09.750 --> 02:10.750]  I really appreciate that.
[02:10.750 --> 02:12.150]  That's really super cool.
[02:12.150 --> 02:15.510]  I don't have any advertising to do at the start of this show.
[02:15.510 --> 02:17.350]  I already fucked it up anyway.
[02:17.350 --> 02:18.350]  No, no, dude.
[02:18.350 --> 02:19.350]  You don't fuck anything up.
[02:19.350 --> 02:20.350]  I like it when you're here.
[02:20.350 --> 02:21.350]  You break up the monotony.
[02:21.350 --> 02:22.990]  You make it explosively fun.
[02:22.990 --> 02:23.990]  You make it entertaining.
[02:23.990 --> 02:24.990]  You good?
[02:24.990 --> 02:25.990]  Sorry.
[02:25.990 --> 02:31.390]  Paul texted me and I accidentally looked at it.
[02:31.390 --> 02:32.790]  I missed all that.
[02:32.790 --> 02:34.590]  I missed everything you said.
[02:34.590 --> 02:36.670]  I'm a jerk.
[02:36.670 --> 02:39.310]  Clint Scott, who we've been referring to as Goldfish Brain.
[02:40.070 --> 02:42.790]  About every 30 seconds, Clint resets.
[02:42.790 --> 02:44.590]  Welcome to the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[02:44.590 --> 02:45.590]  Yeah, there you go.
[02:45.590 --> 02:47.190]  See, he's back at the beginning again.
[02:47.190 --> 02:51.270]  So guys, the first thing that Clint and I want to do is review the Doug Benson album.
[02:51.270 --> 02:57.070]  On 420, Doug Benson came to Denver, Colorado, and he did three shows and recorded all three
[02:57.070 --> 03:03.950]  of them for his new comedy album, which was called Promotional Tool.
[03:03.950 --> 03:06.270]  And it came out just a few days ago here.
[03:06.270 --> 03:07.270]  I think it came out on the 5th.
[03:07.270 --> 03:09.630]  I think it was the 9th, but you're high, so it's okay.
[03:09.630 --> 03:12.230]  Oh, yeah, it was 5.9, not 9.5.
[03:12.230 --> 03:13.230]  That's cool.
[03:13.230 --> 03:14.230]  You'll be all right eventually.
[03:14.230 --> 03:15.230]  God, I hope this is funny.
[03:15.230 --> 03:16.230]  This is funny.
[03:16.230 --> 03:20.630]  If this is just me just being a fucking dick and your fans have to listen to it, oh, I
[03:20.630 --> 03:21.630]  feel so bad.
[03:21.630 --> 03:23.030]  I'm having fun, so hopefully they will too.
[03:23.030 --> 03:27.470]  Do you get a certain percentage or do you know anybody in Pueblo listening?
[03:27.470 --> 03:29.430]  A lot of our Pueblo friends listen.
[03:29.430 --> 03:30.430]  Yeah.
[03:30.430 --> 03:34.950]  Actually, I found out that Drew listens and that-
[03:34.950 --> 03:35.950]  On Dustin's list, Joe?
[03:35.950 --> 03:36.950]  Joe listens.
[03:37.630 --> 03:39.910]  Joe and his friend that I just met, I want to call him Kevin.
[03:39.910 --> 03:40.910]  Joe and Kevin listen.
[03:40.910 --> 03:44.510]  I did not know that those guys listen, so shout out to Joe and Kevin that I recently
[03:44.510 --> 03:46.230]  saw on Baca's couch.
[03:46.230 --> 03:47.230]  Baca listens.
[03:47.230 --> 03:49.030]  Yeah, we get a lot of local listeners.
[03:49.030 --> 03:50.030]  Yeah.
[03:50.030 --> 03:51.030]  And Arnie listen.
[03:51.030 --> 03:52.430]  Mark has been listening.
[03:52.430 --> 03:53.430]  Shout out to Mark.
[03:53.430 --> 03:54.470]  He's finally paying attention.
[03:54.470 --> 03:57.830]  So let's make this a real big deal.
[03:57.830 --> 03:58.830]  You know what I mean?
[03:58.830 --> 04:03.630]  What if this podcast became a real big deal just in Pueblo?
[04:03.630 --> 04:07.870]  When a comedian would come down or when a band had come through, it'd be cool for them
[04:07.870 --> 04:12.870]  to like, man, it'd be cool to go get a little bit too high with Ross to Jeff.
[04:12.870 --> 04:15.470]  Like it's the morning radio show before the show?
[04:15.470 --> 04:20.670]  Kind of, but more so like it's a get for you.
[04:20.670 --> 04:21.910]  It'd almost be like that.
[04:21.910 --> 04:24.190]  It'd be great to have that radio show idea.
[04:24.190 --> 04:28.630]  So what you're saying is that since the Wild Cousins are presenting a comedy show with
[04:28.630 --> 04:30.790]  a man by the name of Sam Talent-
[04:30.790 --> 04:32.390]  The funniest man I've ever seen.
[04:32.430 --> 04:38.430]  On July 23rd, 2015 at the Rainbow Bar, are you saying that maybe we should have Sam Talent
[04:38.430 --> 04:42.390]  come be on the podcast and be a little bit funny and we could talk to him about his cannabis
[04:42.390 --> 04:43.390]  experience?
[04:43.390 --> 04:44.390]  Maybe he's got a funny weed story?
[04:44.390 --> 04:46.310]  Is that what you're thinking we could do?
[04:46.310 --> 04:47.310]  You know what?
[04:47.310 --> 04:48.310]  Let me ask him.
[04:48.310 --> 04:49.310]  I will ask him.
[04:49.310 --> 04:50.310]  All right.
[04:50.310 --> 04:51.310]  And I would love for that to happen.
[04:51.310 --> 04:52.310]  All right.
[04:52.310 --> 04:53.310]  Well, you got to come too because I don't know the guy.
[04:53.310 --> 04:54.310]  All right guys.
[04:54.310 --> 04:57.510]  So in the future, Clint is going to try to get a comedian by the name of Sam Talent on
[04:57.510 --> 04:58.510]  the show here.
[04:58.510 --> 05:03.150]  And he's going to do a show at the Rainbow Bar, July 23rd, 2015.
[05:03.150 --> 05:05.350]  It is a free show, but donations are encouraged.
[05:05.350 --> 05:06.350]  Check it out.
[05:06.350 --> 05:09.590]  If you're listening to this show, show up, pay $5 because that's what I feel you should
[05:09.590 --> 05:10.590]  do.
[05:10.590 --> 05:11.590]  The show will be worth $5.
[05:11.590 --> 05:12.590]  Pay $5.
[05:12.590 --> 05:13.590]  Don't go be a cheap ass.
[05:13.590 --> 05:14.590]  It's a free show.
[05:14.590 --> 05:16.750]  You'll look like a pimp if you throw down five for the free show.
[05:16.750 --> 05:17.870]  I think you should do it.
[05:17.870 --> 05:18.870]  For sure, dude.
[05:18.870 --> 05:19.870]  All right.
[05:19.870 --> 05:20.870]  That's a fun show.
[05:20.870 --> 05:25.950]  That's got my buddy Paul Rosales and my other buddy John Bueno on that show.
[05:25.950 --> 05:28.830]  And that is my little comedy crew called the Wild Cousins.
[05:28.830 --> 05:29.830]  Shout out to the Wild Cousins.
[05:29.830 --> 05:30.830]  Appreciate it, brother.
[05:30.830 --> 05:34.510]  I was wearing my Wild Cousins shirt yesterday and people like to give me the weirdest looks.
[05:34.510 --> 05:35.510]  I love it, dude.
[05:35.510 --> 05:37.910]  The shirt has a kitty cat shooting an assault rifle.
[05:37.910 --> 05:41.870]  And definitely I'm a six foot five dude with dreadlocks and people look at me with great
[05:41.870 --> 05:42.870]  confusion.
[05:42.870 --> 05:43.870]  It's just such a weird shirt.
[05:43.870 --> 05:44.870]  I don't know.
[05:44.870 --> 05:45.870]  I love it.
[05:45.870 --> 05:48.510]  We got a whole bunch of them and we just like have never tried to sell them.
[05:48.510 --> 05:52.230]  It's so fun that we just gave up on them immediately.
[05:52.230 --> 05:56.470]  I am thinking about getting Grow From Your Heart podcast t-shirts made here eventually.
[05:56.470 --> 05:57.630]  I'd rock one of those.
[05:57.630 --> 06:00.430]  Hopefully by episode 100 I'll be able to give a couple of them away.
[06:00.430 --> 06:01.910]  You should talk to Barrett.
[06:01.910 --> 06:02.910]  Shout out to Barrett.
[06:02.910 --> 06:03.910]  Yes.
[06:03.910 --> 06:04.910]  Shout out to Barrett.
[06:04.910 --> 06:05.910]  Is that Last Leaf?
[06:05.910 --> 06:06.910]  Does he work?
[06:06.910 --> 06:07.910]  Last Leaf I think is Mo.
[06:07.910 --> 06:08.910]  Mo, okay.
[06:08.910 --> 06:09.910]  Yes.
[06:09.910 --> 06:10.910]  I thought they were together.
[06:10.910 --> 06:11.910]  Mo's not doing shirts though.
[06:11.910 --> 06:15.910]  Mo does like, I think unless Barrett bought up Mo's shit and they just call it the same
[06:15.910 --> 06:16.910]  thing.
[06:16.910 --> 06:17.910]  All right.
[06:17.910 --> 06:18.910]  So this just got real local.
[06:18.910 --> 06:19.910]  What's up guys?
[06:19.910 --> 06:20.910]  We're going to go back to talking about funny weed shit.
[06:20.910 --> 06:21.910]  So we went and saw Doug Benson.
[06:22.590 --> 06:23.590]  Yes.
[06:23.590 --> 06:24.590]  On 420 we saw Doug Benson.
[06:24.590 --> 06:25.590]  He did three shows at the Comedy Works.
[06:25.590 --> 06:26.590]  Shout out to Comedy Works.
[06:26.590 --> 06:28.390]  That's my favorite comedy club on the planet.
[06:28.390 --> 06:30.190]  Really quickly, I owe a shout out to Baker.
[06:30.190 --> 06:34.670]  Baker was watching my Periscope broadcast last night and having a conversation with
[06:34.670 --> 06:36.910]  me and I was slightly honored.
[06:36.910 --> 06:37.910]  I like that guy.
[06:37.910 --> 06:38.910]  Dude, Baker's a good dude.
[06:38.910 --> 06:40.310]  He came out and shook my hand the other day.
[06:40.310 --> 06:44.110]  I recognized him and I waved at him and he recognized me probably because I'm fucking
[06:44.110 --> 06:45.110]  ridiculous looking.
[06:45.110 --> 06:46.110]  It's the tall thing.
[06:46.110 --> 06:47.110]  It's the tall thing.
[06:47.110 --> 06:50.110]  Yeah, but he goes, I go, Hey Baker, thanks man.
[06:50.310 --> 06:52.310]  That was after the show.
[06:52.310 --> 06:53.310]  Cool.
[06:53.310 --> 06:56.430]  Because we had actually moved pretty fast.
[06:56.430 --> 06:57.430]  I'm getting rambly again.
[06:57.430 --> 06:58.430]  That's all right.
[06:58.430 --> 06:59.430]  You're nice.
[06:59.430 --> 07:00.430]  I'm super high.
[07:00.430 --> 07:01.430]  Baker's fucking cool shit.
[07:01.430 --> 07:04.230]  Guys, this is great because I've never seen Clint this high and he's almost uncomfortably
[07:04.230 --> 07:07.150]  high and I can see him like resituate himself every few minutes.
[07:07.150 --> 07:08.150]  So it's great.
[07:08.150 --> 07:09.990]  And that's going to lead into something that we're going to talk about in a little bit
[07:09.990 --> 07:12.790]  here too if we have time because Clint keeps talking a lot.
[07:12.790 --> 07:14.390]  So I feel like you're a...
[07:14.390 --> 07:16.390]  Four episodes later.
[07:16.390 --> 07:17.390]  Yes.
[07:17.670 --> 07:21.670]  I was going to make a reference and then I forgot the dude's name so we won't even do
[07:21.670 --> 07:22.670]  it.
[07:22.670 --> 07:27.030]  It feels like you are Pete Holmes-ing me.
[07:27.030 --> 07:28.030]  That's what's happening here.
[07:28.030 --> 07:29.030]  I'm being Pete Holmes-ed.
[07:29.030 --> 07:32.990]  If you ever watch any of Doug Benson's podcast, Pete Holmes will love to just interrupt and
[07:32.990 --> 07:34.990]  drag on and you're Pete Holmes-ing me.
[07:34.990 --> 07:37.270]  Yes, you're Pete Holmes-ing me.
[07:37.270 --> 07:39.390]  So we're going to do a little...
[07:39.390 --> 07:41.390]  On 420, Doug came and did those comedy shows, right?
[07:41.390 --> 07:42.390]  At Comedy Works.
[07:42.390 --> 07:46.750]  Clint and I and a couple other people had the honor of going to the third show that
[07:46.750 --> 07:50.310]  night, which may have been a mistake.
[07:50.310 --> 07:52.430]  And we've talked about that on the podcast before.
[07:52.430 --> 07:53.630]  Yes, we did.
[07:53.630 --> 08:00.870]  So we downloaded the CD on the day that it came out and we listened to it.
[08:00.870 --> 08:06.030]  So the fun part that I noticed right away is he used the opening from the show we attended.
[08:06.030 --> 08:07.030]  For sure he did.
[08:07.030 --> 08:09.390]  Yeah, because he talks about how he was trying to get too high.
[08:09.390 --> 08:10.390]  Oh, dude.
[08:10.390 --> 08:12.470]  Yeah, that was definite.
[08:12.470 --> 08:14.710]  It's not like he could have done that twice.
[08:14.710 --> 08:20.510]  But even later in the album, you can hear him and he's not that high.
[08:20.510 --> 08:23.870]  And it's just like, oh man, I wish I'd went to those other shows.
[08:23.870 --> 08:28.750]  There were a couple of pieces that I'm certain came from our show.
[08:28.750 --> 08:31.550]  And then I know that there's someone like, oh, he did not do that at our show because
[08:31.550 --> 08:32.550]  he sounds awake.
[08:32.550 --> 08:38.150]  But one of my favorite parts of the entire album is that on track one, there are multiple
[08:38.190 --> 08:41.430]  times when I can hear Clint over laughing.
[08:41.430 --> 08:42.430]  Clint is like a dick.
[08:42.430 --> 08:44.390]  Oh no, it's great, dude, because it's genuine.
[08:44.390 --> 08:45.390]  But you're laughing.
[08:45.390 --> 08:49.830]  You're such a big dude and your laugh is so low that it just shakes the entire comedy
[08:49.830 --> 08:50.830]  club when you laugh.
[08:50.830 --> 08:53.350]  And we're in the front row in that little pit area.
[08:53.350 --> 08:54.710]  And there's a lot of sound right there.
[08:54.710 --> 08:57.510]  And you're coming through on the mic so well.
[08:57.510 --> 09:01.310]  You can just hear Clint like, ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[09:01.310 --> 09:04.430]  It's so fucking funny hearing your buddy laugh on a comedy album.
[09:04.430 --> 09:05.430]  That's pretty cool.
[09:05.430 --> 09:06.430]  It was great.
[09:06.510 --> 09:09.230]  The shitty thing is the comedy album.
[09:09.230 --> 09:10.230]  Not that funny.
[09:10.230 --> 09:11.230]  You know, Doug's my friend.
[09:11.230 --> 09:12.230]  You know what sucks?
[09:12.230 --> 09:15.230]  I might have been the funniest thing on that album.
[09:15.230 --> 09:17.230]  You're the funniest thing.
[09:17.230 --> 09:20.230]  Please don't tell Doug Benson I said that.
[09:20.230 --> 09:22.230]  Ballweed might be the funniest thing on that album.
[09:22.230 --> 09:23.710]  God, he would hate me.
[09:23.710 --> 09:24.710]  He might.
[09:24.710 --> 09:25.710]  But you know what?
[09:25.710 --> 09:26.710]  You're being honest.
[09:26.710 --> 09:27.710]  I just didn't think it was that good.
[09:27.710 --> 09:30.710]  We went and saw that show and I had a prejudice against it already, though.
[09:30.710 --> 09:31.710]  You know what I mean?
[09:31.710 --> 09:32.710]  Yeah.
[09:32.710 --> 09:33.710]  Because I was already a little mad at him.
[09:33.990 --> 09:38.990]  The first track is 25 minutes of Doug reading tweets on his comedy album.
[09:38.990 --> 09:44.390]  Like, I know that's what he does in his live show, but he's just riffing off of them.
[09:44.390 --> 09:45.390]  Yeah.
[09:45.390 --> 09:48.390]  If I was going to do a comedy album, if I were a comedian, I would put together, I would
[09:48.390 --> 09:49.390]  Joe Rogan that bitch.
[09:49.390 --> 09:52.830]  I would put together the tightest one hour that I could come.
[09:52.830 --> 09:56.990]  And it might take you two years to do it, but you're real happy to do it like that.
[09:56.990 --> 09:57.990]  Exactly.
[09:57.990 --> 09:58.990]  Yeah.
[09:58.990 --> 10:01.310]  So the first album is 25 minutes of him reading tweets.
[10:01.310 --> 10:02.790]  I think I'm the first track.
[10:02.870 --> 10:06.870]  The second track is called Watch This, Not That, where he plays a game that he normally
[10:06.870 --> 10:08.230]  plays on his podcast.
[10:08.230 --> 10:09.230]  For free.
[10:09.230 --> 10:10.230]  For free.
[10:10.230 --> 10:14.550]  And it felt like I paid $5 to download a podcast, basically, because I listened to his podcast
[10:14.550 --> 10:16.710]  frequently, and it didn't feel any better than that.
[10:16.710 --> 10:22.350]  That son of a bitch turned 50 on us, and all of a sudden he became a money hungry fucking
[10:22.350 --> 10:23.350]  capitalist.
[10:23.350 --> 10:24.350]  He doesn't even smoke weed.
[10:24.350 --> 10:25.350]  This is all a ruse.
[10:25.350 --> 10:26.350]  Oh, no, no.
[10:26.350 --> 10:27.350]  He is.
[10:27.350 --> 10:28.350]  Doug smokes.
[10:28.350 --> 10:29.350]  He doesn't smoke.
[10:29.350 --> 10:30.350]  Nope.
[10:30.350 --> 10:31.350]  All right.
[10:31.470 --> 10:33.470]  So anyway, about this album.
[10:33.470 --> 10:38.030]  Yeah, the album, like I was saying, the first track is reading tweets.
[10:38.030 --> 10:42.710]  The second track is talking about something that he normally does on his podcast.
[10:42.710 --> 10:46.770]  Then he actually tells a joke, and then he tells a couple more jokes, and then he promotes
[10:46.770 --> 10:52.030]  his other podcasts, and then he promotes another podcast, and then he promotes his other podcast,
[10:52.030 --> 10:55.750]  and then he talks about traveling, and then he actually does a really good joke.
[10:55.750 --> 10:59.750]  It's not a well put together album, and that sucks because Doug's one of my favorite people.
[10:59.750 --> 11:00.750]  He's my friend.
[11:01.150 --> 11:02.150]  I call Doug my friend.
[11:02.150 --> 11:03.150]  He knows who I am.
[11:03.150 --> 11:06.470]  We contact each other, and to see one of your friends put something out like that, it's
[11:06.470 --> 11:11.110]  almost like, oh, man, you could have done a little harder on that.
[11:11.110 --> 11:15.990]  Most comedy albums, the comedian will start with a decent story, and then tell you a couple
[11:15.990 --> 11:19.870]  jokes, and then by the time you've forgotten about that first story, he'll tell you another
[11:19.870 --> 11:24.070]  part that reminds you of that, that refers to that to make you laugh.
[11:24.070 --> 11:26.990]  Doug has already forgotten the first part of his act by the time he's 20 minutes in.
[11:26.990 --> 11:27.990]  He can't do a callback.
[11:27.990 --> 11:30.190]  That's what I'm doing right now.
[11:30.270 --> 11:31.270]  We got Clint too high today.
[11:31.270 --> 11:32.270]  Clint got himself too high.
[11:32.270 --> 11:33.270]  Sorry, guys.
[11:33.270 --> 11:34.270]  That's all right.
[11:34.270 --> 11:35.270]  This podcast sucks.
[11:35.270 --> 11:40.430]  So, if you could give Doug Benson's album ... The podcast doesn't suck, bro.
[11:40.430 --> 11:41.510]  We're going to make it rock.
[11:41.510 --> 11:45.830]  If you could give Doug Benson's album up to five pot leaves, a scale of one to five pot
[11:45.830 --> 11:47.910]  leaves, how many leaves are you going to give him?
[11:47.910 --> 11:49.390]  He's going to get one pot leaf.
[11:49.390 --> 11:50.790]  He's going to get one pot leaf.
[11:50.790 --> 11:54.510]  See, I'll give him two, maybe two and a half or three, but it definitely was not a four
[11:54.510 --> 11:55.870]  or five star performance.
[11:55.870 --> 11:59.270]  Yeah, he's your friend, and I think you're being generous.
[12:00.270 --> 12:08.550]  I think I'm being mean too, but there's just so many ... There's so much to do out there
[12:08.550 --> 12:09.550]  now.
[12:09.550 --> 12:10.550]  Yes.
[12:10.550 --> 12:11.550]  I could download anything.
[12:11.550 --> 12:12.550]  Yeah.
[12:12.550 --> 12:20.350]  And if that's ... That album right there is my only introduction to Doug Benson.
[12:20.350 --> 12:23.270]  That's the only thing I know of him other than his podcast.
[12:23.270 --> 12:24.270]  Yeah.
[12:24.270 --> 12:31.110]  I am the perfect demographic to go, dude, I'm not a cult follower, so I'm mad that I
[12:31.110 --> 12:32.110]  bought this.
[12:32.110 --> 12:34.150]  I'm mad that I went to that show a little bit.
[12:34.150 --> 12:38.310]  Yeah, that was 25 bucks that you spent on being disappointed twice now.
[12:38.310 --> 12:39.310]  Yeah.
[12:39.310 --> 12:40.310]  Okay.
[12:40.310 --> 12:41.310]  I could have done that with a hooker.
[12:41.310 --> 12:42.310]  Huh.
[12:42.310 --> 12:43.310]  Yeah, that's why you're disappointed.
[12:43.310 --> 12:44.310]  You're paying $25 on a hooker.
[12:44.310 --> 12:45.310]  God damn it, dude.
[12:45.310 --> 12:46.310]  That's got to be the problem.
[12:46.310 --> 12:47.790]  I am not getting any in.
[12:47.790 --> 12:48.790]  You need to upgrade.
[12:48.790 --> 12:49.790]  Jesus Christ.
[12:49.790 --> 12:51.470]  If you're getting $25 hookers, man, that's your problem.
[12:51.470 --> 12:53.070]  All right, so we're going to move on from Doug.
[12:53.070 --> 12:55.310]  Hey, Doug, sorry I had to bash your album, dude.
[12:55.310 --> 12:56.310]  Sorry, man.
[12:56.310 --> 12:57.990]  You got to put it together more.
[12:57.990 --> 12:59.110]  I still like you.
[12:59.110 --> 13:00.590]  Yeah, I still love you, bro.
[13:00.590 --> 13:02.830]  I'm going to come to your show on the 5th of July.
[13:02.830 --> 13:04.510]  I'll see you there at the Comedy Works in Denver.
[13:04.510 --> 13:05.510]  I've already got tickets.
[13:05.510 --> 13:06.910]  I'm not sure that Clint wants to go.
[13:06.910 --> 13:08.470]  Yeah, I'm not going.
[13:08.470 --> 13:10.750]  But I got someone else I could take.
[13:10.750 --> 13:11.750]  But I'll be there, Doug.
[13:11.750 --> 13:12.750]  Don't worry.
[13:12.750 --> 13:15.710]  I just wasn't ... I like the way that Proops put together a comedy album.
[13:15.710 --> 13:17.830]  I like the way Ari put together a comedy album.
[13:17.830 --> 13:23.390]  It's got more continuity is the word I'm looking for.
[13:23.390 --> 13:25.670]  It flows a little bit better.
[13:25.670 --> 13:27.110]  I'd prefer that out of a comedy album.
[13:27.110 --> 13:28.870]  Did you watch that Bill Burr album?
[13:28.870 --> 13:30.510]  You know, I did see that one.
[13:30.510 --> 13:31.510]  The black and white one?
[13:31.510 --> 13:32.510]  Yeah.
[13:32.510 --> 13:33.510]  What's it called?
[13:33.510 --> 13:36.110]  Shit, I don't remember now, but that was great.
[13:36.110 --> 13:37.870]  That's what I expect out of a comedy album.
[13:37.870 --> 13:39.310]  That's a little bit better.
[13:39.310 --> 13:45.030]  That's hard to be like, all right, well, here's this guy who's perfect at this.
[13:45.030 --> 13:46.030]  That's Bill Burr to me.
[13:46.030 --> 13:47.590]  He's perfect at it.
[13:48.350 --> 13:50.510]  He works so hard at it.
[13:50.510 --> 13:53.750]  And it's so exciting to watch somebody be perfect at something.
[13:53.750 --> 13:55.910]  Anthony Jezelnik is damn near perfect at it.
[13:55.910 --> 14:02.710]  See, it's just, I think that Jezelnik has his routine.
[14:02.710 --> 14:06.990]  But Bill Burr could just go off on anything.
[14:06.990 --> 14:08.990]  It's fucking lovely.
[14:08.990 --> 14:10.670]  It's so beautiful to watch.
[14:10.670 --> 14:16.390]  And so most of those bits that he has, he's kind of half improvising as he's telling the
[14:16.390 --> 14:17.390]  joke.
[14:18.190 --> 14:19.470]  And he knows how long and what beats he wants to hit.
[14:19.470 --> 14:24.230]  But it's not like that regimented, I say it like this, Jezelnik kind of way.
[14:24.230 --> 14:26.230]  And Jezelnik is kind of a robot in that.
[14:26.230 --> 14:29.150]  Well, you've said it plenty of times, like he counts.
[14:29.150 --> 14:31.070]  Yeah, he counts.
[14:31.070 --> 14:32.710]  I can see his throat moving when he counts.
[14:32.710 --> 14:33.710]  Yeah.
[14:33.710 --> 14:34.710]  I can see him say the word 11.
[14:34.710 --> 14:35.710]  Yeah.
[14:35.710 --> 14:37.950]  But that's what I'm saying is like he...
[14:37.950 --> 14:42.030]  Bill Burr can go in there and do his routine and then break away and do some dance moves
[14:42.030 --> 14:43.870]  and then go back to the routine.
[14:43.870 --> 14:45.710]  And I love that about a comedian.
[14:45.710 --> 14:47.150]  Proops has that ability as well.
[14:47.910 --> 14:48.910]  Oh, he's so fucking smart.
[14:48.910 --> 14:49.910]  Yeah.
[14:49.910 --> 14:50.910]  Jesus.
[14:50.910 --> 14:53.470]  Well, when we were talking to him, when he smacked you that day about that story, it
[14:53.470 --> 14:54.750]  was just so much fun.
[14:54.750 --> 14:56.750]  Just he was just being in the room with him was fun.
[14:56.750 --> 14:57.750]  Yeah.
[14:57.750 --> 14:58.750]  He's got that storyteller personality.
[14:58.750 --> 15:01.790]  They need to get Greg Proops on This Is Not Happening.
[15:01.790 --> 15:02.790]  That would be fucking awesome.
[15:02.790 --> 15:03.790]  That'd be fun, dude.
[15:03.790 --> 15:04.790]  Yeah.
[15:04.790 --> 15:05.790]  Season three or two is coming out pretty soon.
[15:05.790 --> 15:06.790]  All right.
[15:06.790 --> 15:07.790]  We're way off topic.
[15:07.790 --> 15:08.790]  We're rambly, but that's all right.
[15:08.790 --> 15:09.790]  Clint's coming back around.
[15:09.790 --> 15:10.790]  I can feel him connecting a little more.
[15:10.790 --> 15:11.790]  Yeah.
[15:11.790 --> 15:14.150]  The goldfish in his brain is not swimming in such short circles.
[15:14.150 --> 15:15.150]  The laps have gotten larger.
[15:15.150 --> 15:17.030]  I got sweetie birds now.
[15:17.910 --> 15:21.230]  He upgraded the squirrel that runs on the cage will be back pretty soon.
[15:21.230 --> 15:22.230]  Yeah.
[15:22.230 --> 15:23.230]  All right.
[15:23.230 --> 15:24.230]  Give him a smoke break.
[15:24.230 --> 15:25.230]  Somebody sent me in.
[15:25.230 --> 15:26.230]  See, you're getting almost funny.
[15:26.230 --> 15:27.230]  That was pretty fucking dumb.
[15:27.230 --> 15:28.230]  No, it was good.
[15:28.230 --> 15:29.230]  I almost started to talk over it, but then I was like, we got to give him credit for
[15:29.230 --> 15:30.230]  that one.
[15:30.230 --> 15:43.230]  Somebody sent me a Facebook message and it was a good question for Clint because they
[15:43.230 --> 15:46.230]  said, how much should I be smoking?
[15:46.430 --> 15:47.430]  Yeah.
[15:47.430 --> 15:48.430]  One.
[15:48.430 --> 15:49.430]  One.
[15:49.430 --> 15:50.430]  Yeah.
[15:50.430 --> 15:51.430]  Today, Clint should have only taken one.
[15:51.430 --> 15:52.430]  Yeah, it seems like it.
[15:52.430 --> 15:55.590]  That's, I can't, that's the beauty of cannabis.
[15:55.590 --> 16:00.070]  If you're using medical marijuana, the beauty of it is that it's up to you.
[16:00.070 --> 16:03.630]  That's why you have chosen to medicate yourself with medical marijuana because some doctor
[16:03.630 --> 16:06.470]  isn't saying take two of these every so often.
[16:06.470 --> 16:12.110]  It's up to you to figure out how many puffs off of this bowl or how much of this joint
[16:12.110 --> 16:15.670]  I need to smoke to ease my medical condition.
[16:15.670 --> 16:19.630]  And then you want to, you're going to have to, I guess if you've never smoked, light
[16:19.630 --> 16:23.110]  up a joint and take two puffs and then see how that does.
[16:23.110 --> 16:24.990]  If that's way too much next time, only take one.
[16:24.990 --> 16:27.030]  If that didn't do it, take three next time.
[16:27.030 --> 16:28.030]  Make a smaller joint.
[16:28.030 --> 16:29.030]  Yeah.
[16:29.030 --> 16:33.590]  Roll a smaller joint and don't get as high, but it's hard for me to tell you how much
[16:33.590 --> 16:39.230]  you should be smoking because we, I just watched Clint take three hits off of a bowl of some
[16:39.230 --> 16:42.390]  pretty high grade sour diesel and he is high.
[16:42.390 --> 16:48.630]  Jeff took two and then two fucking dabs and I'm about to take another dab like fucking
[16:48.630 --> 16:49.630]  tabs.
[16:49.630 --> 16:51.670]  Well, I know dab dabs are my friend.
[16:51.670 --> 16:56.670]  Clint says dabs are drugs and I can see why he says that, but it's all about what you
[16:56.670 --> 16:57.670]  need.
[16:57.670 --> 16:59.630]  Are you smoking to medicate yourself?
[16:59.630 --> 17:05.710]  Uh, are, if you're smoking to prevent seizures, smoke as much as you want to smoke all day.
[17:05.710 --> 17:09.670]  Like there, it's, it really just smoke until you're comfortable.
[17:09.670 --> 17:10.670]  Yeah.
[17:10.670 --> 17:14.870]  As long as you're smoking, isn't hindering your ability to be a productive person.
[17:14.870 --> 17:20.070]  As long as it's not causing you a financial problem, a health problem, a mental problem,
[17:20.070 --> 17:23.110]  a motivational problem, a relationship problem.
[17:23.110 --> 17:29.990]  Uh, if, as long as you're not using it as a crutch, as long as it's not an anchor or
[17:29.990 --> 17:33.830]  something negative, as long as it's not causing a problem is my point here.
[17:33.830 --> 17:36.270]  Smoke as much as you feel comfortable with.
[17:36.270 --> 17:39.350]  I don't recommend every day trying to see how high you can get.
[17:39.350 --> 17:42.390]  You don't need to be Joey Diaz and try to see the fucking devil every day.
[17:42.390 --> 17:44.430]  I don't know why people want to do that.
[17:44.430 --> 17:45.430]  Try it once.
[17:45.430 --> 17:48.430]  You know, why not just push the limit?
[17:48.430 --> 17:49.430]  Nope.
[17:49.430 --> 17:50.430]  Okay.
[17:50.430 --> 17:52.590]  And if you don't want to, that's the thing is because I'm comfortable, you kind of are
[17:52.590 --> 17:53.590]  pushing though.
[17:53.590 --> 17:54.590]  That third one was your limit.
[17:54.590 --> 17:55.590]  You're pushing it now.
[17:55.590 --> 17:56.590]  Okay.
[17:56.590 --> 17:57.590]  That was okay.
[17:57.590 --> 17:58.590]  Yeah.
[17:58.590 --> 17:59.590]  Pushing the limit, but not like going to see the devil.
[17:59.590 --> 18:00.590]  No, no.
[18:00.590 --> 18:01.590]  Yeah.
[18:01.590 --> 18:02.590]  Don't get cross-eyed and don't take seven dabs.
[18:02.590 --> 18:03.590]  Your first try.
[18:03.590 --> 18:04.590]  See, that's what I get.
[18:04.590 --> 18:07.190]  That's that fucking peer pressure is a motherfucker though.
[18:07.190 --> 18:08.190]  You know what I mean?
[18:08.430 --> 18:15.310]  Not at our age, but I remember like when we were like 16, 18, I would have done anything.
[18:15.310 --> 18:16.310]  Anything.
[18:16.310 --> 18:17.310]  Yeah.
[18:17.310 --> 18:19.310]  Like if you wanted for you to think I was cool, I would have done anything.
[18:19.310 --> 18:21.390]  I would have stabbed motherfucker.
[18:21.390 --> 18:22.590]  Especially if I was going to get laid at the end.
[18:22.590 --> 18:27.950]  Oh dude, if I could get laid at, I didn't get laid until I was 18 and because I was
[18:27.950 --> 18:31.430]  just a late bloomer, but I'm just a skinny fucking white kid.
[18:31.430 --> 18:34.030]  That's just, it's okay.
[18:34.030 --> 18:35.030]  You made up for it.
[18:35.030 --> 18:36.770]  I'm doing okay now.
[18:36.770 --> 18:41.330]  But it's just, it's weird to see that fucking goldfish reset.
[18:41.330 --> 18:42.330]  Yup.
[18:42.330 --> 18:43.330]  Here he goes.
[18:43.330 --> 18:44.330]  New thought process for Clint.
[18:44.330 --> 18:45.330]  Want to go for a bike ride, buddy?
[18:45.330 --> 18:46.330]  Thanks buddy.
[18:46.330 --> 18:47.330]  He gets that ADD.
[18:47.330 --> 18:48.330]  I did lose it buddy.
[18:48.330 --> 18:49.330]  Sorry.
[18:49.330 --> 18:50.330]  No worries.
[18:50.330 --> 18:51.330]  I got your back.
[18:51.330 --> 18:52.330]  I'm the host.
[18:52.330 --> 18:53.330]  I'm paying attention.
[18:53.330 --> 18:54.330]  No edits.
[18:54.330 --> 18:55.330]  I'm leaving all that.
[18:55.330 --> 18:56.330]  I'm leaving all your rambles in today.
[18:56.330 --> 18:57.330]  You get to deal with this.
[18:57.330 --> 18:58.330]  That's your punishment.
[18:58.330 --> 18:59.330]  You get to listen back to yourself.
[18:59.330 --> 19:00.330]  I'm into that.
[19:00.330 --> 19:01.330]  I will too.
[19:01.330 --> 19:02.330]  And I'll be like, that guy's pretty cool.
[19:02.330 --> 19:03.330]  Yeah.
[19:03.330 --> 19:04.330]  Whoever was on the show that day was fucking great.
[19:04.330 --> 19:05.330]  Yeah.
[19:05.890 --> 19:06.890]  Clint maybe only needed two today.
[19:06.890 --> 19:07.890]  Oh, going to see the devil.
[19:07.890 --> 19:08.890]  That's what it was.
[19:08.890 --> 19:09.890]  Going to see the devil.
[19:09.890 --> 19:10.890]  Yeah.
[19:10.890 --> 19:12.330]  Don't do that every day, but do it once in a while if you need to.
[19:12.330 --> 19:15.190]  If you want to see what's on the other side of that wall, take another dab or take another
[19:15.190 --> 19:16.690]  puff off the bowl and see what happens.
[19:16.690 --> 19:18.770]  I'm going to take a puff off of this dab rig right here.
[19:18.770 --> 19:21.650]  I'm smoking some Girl Scout cookies made by the Turpex crew.
[19:21.650 --> 19:24.010]  I picked it up at Green and Healthy Wellness in Colorado Springs.
[19:24.010 --> 19:25.570]  Shout out to the Grimy Gatsby.
[19:25.570 --> 19:26.570]  Shout out to Damsel.
[19:26.570 --> 19:27.570]  Hello, beautiful.
[19:27.570 --> 19:30.770]  And also shout out to John Randall's Jr.
[19:30.770 --> 19:32.250]  John Randall's Jr.
[19:32.250 --> 19:35.970]  I'm going to take a dab, but we need to get Clint started on some sort of rant before
[19:35.970 --> 19:36.970]  I do it.
[19:36.970 --> 19:37.970]  All right.
[19:37.970 --> 19:38.970]  What's on your brain?
[19:38.970 --> 19:39.970]  Here he goes.
[19:39.970 --> 19:40.970]  One, two, three, go.
[19:40.970 --> 19:44.570]  We do an open mic every Thursday at the Rainbow Bar.
[19:44.570 --> 19:48.050]  And I think I've told everybody about this plenty of times.
[19:48.050 --> 19:51.530]  And we have a lot of fun.
[19:51.530 --> 19:54.170]  It's just a comedy open mic.
[19:54.170 --> 19:56.890]  And Jeff's come down a couple of times.
[19:56.890 --> 20:00.730]  I got friends that come down and it's real fun.
[20:00.730 --> 20:02.130]  And we don't charge anybody.
[20:03.010 --> 20:04.010]  Yeah.
[20:04.010 --> 20:06.410]  So it's, I mean, you can buy alcohol if you want.
[20:06.410 --> 20:08.090]  You can just come in and sit around.
[20:08.090 --> 20:10.050]  Like I don't drink.
[20:10.050 --> 20:11.050]  I don't drink.
[20:11.050 --> 20:12.050]  They don't ask me to buy anything.
[20:12.050 --> 20:14.890]  They don't expect anything of you if you don't drink.
[20:14.890 --> 20:18.850]  If you're there for the comedy, you might've brought somebody that was able to drink.
[20:18.850 --> 20:23.090]  That's all they, like we're trying to bring business into the rainbow and get people in
[20:23.090 --> 20:24.850]  front of us.
[20:24.850 --> 20:25.850]  That's the trade off.
[20:25.850 --> 20:27.970]  They have the building for us to do it.
[20:27.970 --> 20:28.970]  They make plenty of money.
[20:28.970 --> 20:31.730]  The regulars are there at the bar drinking and then you guys are bringing in the other
[20:31.730 --> 20:33.930]  group and that are buying drinks.
[20:33.930 --> 20:34.930]  Yeah.
[20:34.930 --> 20:36.530]  But I'm just asking people to start coming out.
[20:36.530 --> 20:37.530]  Please do.
[20:37.530 --> 20:38.530]  Please come out.
[20:38.530 --> 20:39.530]  I'm there occasionally.
[20:39.530 --> 20:41.050]  I can't commit to being there every night because I'm a busy man.
[20:41.050 --> 20:42.050]  I do a podcast.
[20:42.050 --> 20:43.050]  I grow.
[20:43.050 --> 20:44.690]  I don't want anybody there every week either, dude.
[20:44.690 --> 20:48.690]  Like if you're, if you're not there to tell jokes every week, don't come out every week.
[20:48.690 --> 20:49.690]  That would suck.
[20:49.690 --> 20:53.010]  Well, I see all of your rehearsal material and then get bored of you if I come every
[20:53.010 --> 20:54.010]  week.
[20:54.010 --> 20:55.010]  It might dude.
[20:55.010 --> 20:56.330]  Like, but if you came out once every three months.
[20:56.330 --> 20:57.330]  Oh no.
[20:57.330 --> 20:58.330]  I'm not, not you.
[20:58.690 --> 20:59.690]  Not you.
[20:59.690 --> 21:00.690]  Once or twice a month was my goal.
[21:00.690 --> 21:01.690]  Once or twice a month.
[21:01.690 --> 21:02.690]  I'm not even asking that.
[21:02.690 --> 21:03.690]  Do you know what I mean?
[21:03.690 --> 21:07.890]  Like I'm just wanting once every three months out of just one of my friends, you know, and,
[21:07.890 --> 21:11.010]  and you hear the sadness in his voice, you guys, he just sucks.
[21:11.010 --> 21:15.290]  Cause like last night we went to go on, it's a, we, we were going to do it last night.
[21:15.290 --> 21:19.970]  Today's Thursday, but we were going to do one last night and no one showed up and it
[21:19.970 --> 21:21.370]  fucking broke my heart too.
[21:21.370 --> 21:22.370]  Yeah.
[21:22.370 --> 21:25.090]  It's just, we get all everything all set up to go.
[21:25.090 --> 21:28.730]  We're sitting there, you know, 10 o'clock comes around and nobody's there.
[21:28.730 --> 21:29.730]  That's a bummer.
[21:29.730 --> 21:33.770]  I have fucking bands for several years and I've played to the bartender for several shows
[21:33.770 --> 21:35.650]  and it's almost practice, you know?
[21:35.650 --> 21:38.690]  So we didn't even fucking do anything cause we're just like, nah, dude, I don't, I don't
[21:38.690 --> 21:39.690]  want to fucking do this.
[21:39.690 --> 21:40.690]  Yeah.
[21:40.690 --> 21:41.690]  I don't want to perform to Paul.
[21:41.690 --> 21:42.690]  Yeah.
[21:42.690 --> 21:46.730]  And then I just realized I'm just like a, this fucking weird old guy that's like hanging
[21:46.730 --> 21:51.930]  out in bars, not even drinking, not even drinking, not even drinking, smoking weed in the back
[21:51.930 --> 21:52.930]  of fucking bars.
[21:52.930 --> 21:53.930]  All right.
[21:53.930 --> 21:57.490]  So I'm out to the open mic night you guys, because if you don't, uh, they might, uh,
[21:57.490 --> 21:58.890]  not let us keep doing it.
[21:58.890 --> 22:00.890]  Yeah, that's, that's a real thing.
[22:00.890 --> 22:07.450]  Like, uh, we're the only Pueblo open mic and uh, it's, it's going to go away.
[22:07.450 --> 22:12.410]  So we can't even get like other stuff going on cause we can't get anybody to this one.
[22:12.410 --> 22:15.650]  So support local comedy guys, because if you don't support things, they go away and then
[22:15.650 --> 22:17.450]  one day you'll be like, Hey, remember that comedy group?
[22:17.450 --> 22:18.450]  Let's go there.
[22:18.450 --> 22:20.590]  And there won't even fucking exist cause you blew it off for too long.
[22:20.590 --> 22:23.950]  So support the local comedy, uh, as to how much you should be smoking.
[22:23.950 --> 22:26.350]  I'm done taking my dad now so I can rant about that.
[22:26.350 --> 22:28.270]  Uh, smoke until you're comfortably high.
[22:28.270 --> 22:32.190]  Uh, I have, there've been days and this sound, you guys are going to think I'm crazy.
[22:32.190 --> 22:37.430]  There've been days when I've smoked a gram or two by myself, like started a fresh gram
[22:37.430 --> 22:41.910]  when I woke up, got done with it, started another gram and finished that one by myself
[22:41.910 --> 22:44.150]  through that throughout the course of a day.
[22:44.150 --> 22:47.110]  And you would think those are days when I'm sitting around not doing shit, but those are
[22:47.110 --> 22:49.190]  actually the days when I'm doing the most.
[22:49.190 --> 22:50.190]  Yeah.
[22:50.790 --> 22:54.070]  I don't know how I do it, but I'll stop and take four or five fat dads and go right back
[22:54.070 --> 22:58.590]  to work, work for an hour or two, take four or five more dads, go right back to work.
[22:58.590 --> 22:59.590]  Uh, yeah.
[22:59.590 --> 23:01.230]  Cause you're busy and you got your mind going.
[23:01.230 --> 23:06.750]  So like the high doesn't stick around as much, at least like you're using it though.
[23:06.750 --> 23:09.270]  You know how at the end of the day, your back hurts and you're all sore.
[23:09.270 --> 23:12.070]  If you've been doing work, I don't get that because I've been dabbing all day.
[23:12.070 --> 23:15.070]  Like my body doesn't even, my muscles stay loose and relaxed.
[23:15.070 --> 23:18.390]  I'm like, I guess it's like going and taking an, a leave, you know, instead of taking a
[23:18.390 --> 23:22.750]  leave or Tylenol or Prickle, whatever's I'm just taking a few dabs and keeping the pain
[23:22.750 --> 23:24.150]  away all the time for sure.
[23:24.150 --> 23:26.590]  And it kind of, the dabs make my head.
[23:26.590 --> 23:30.090]  I talk about, I prefer Indica flowers and sativa dabs.
[23:30.090 --> 23:31.790]  Dabs make my head go really fast.
[23:31.790 --> 23:36.150]  I take the alpha brain, take two dabs and drink a little bit of caffeine and bro, I
[23:36.150 --> 23:38.310]  can work for 12 hours straight without a break.
[23:38.310 --> 23:39.310]  No shit.
[23:39.310 --> 23:40.310]  Let's just go.
[23:40.310 --> 23:41.310]  Yeah.
[23:41.310 --> 23:42.310]  Picking at your skin.
[23:42.310 --> 23:43.310]  I don't know what that was.
[23:43.310 --> 23:44.310]  That was weird.
[23:44.310 --> 23:46.030]  Cause you started saying I can work for like 12 hours state and then they started picking
[23:46.030 --> 23:47.030]  at your skin.
[23:47.030 --> 23:49.950]  I'm like, what the f I, what else are you doing in them dabs?
[23:49.950 --> 23:54.230]  So I ate a donut earlier and apparently part of the frosting was stuck to my arm hair and
[23:54.230 --> 23:55.870]  when I pulled on it, it really hurt.
[23:55.870 --> 23:56.870]  Oh my God.
[23:56.870 --> 23:57.870]  You're such a wuss.
[23:57.870 --> 23:59.270]  Well, you pull on your arm hair, bro.
[23:59.270 --> 24:00.270]  Pull some of that shit out.
[24:00.270 --> 24:01.270]  Yeah.
[24:01.270 --> 24:02.270]  Okay.
[24:02.270 --> 24:03.270]  It's not a thing.
[24:03.270 --> 24:04.270]  You're cooler than me.
[24:04.270 --> 24:05.270]  I'm just so high.
[24:05.270 --> 24:06.270]  I couldn't feel my arm.
[24:06.270 --> 24:10.870]  I had a donut frosting dingleberry in my arm hair.
[24:10.870 --> 24:12.550]  I like, I like that.
[24:12.550 --> 24:15.510]  I like donut frosting dingleberry in my arm hair.
[24:15.510 --> 24:18.910]  I know just, I just like the donut frosting dingleberry.
[24:18.910 --> 24:19.910]  I like that.
[24:19.910 --> 24:20.910]  I don't know why.
[24:20.910 --> 24:27.710]  I hope that you consider that for the name of this episode.
[24:27.710 --> 24:29.350]  Nobody will listen if we do that.
[24:29.350 --> 24:30.350]  But I warned him.
[24:30.350 --> 24:32.830]  I warned them immediately when they were coming on.
[24:32.830 --> 24:34.230]  If they're still with us.
[24:34.230 --> 24:35.230]  Yeah.
[24:35.230 --> 24:36.230]  You guys are soldiers.
[24:36.230 --> 24:37.270]  Not soldier on.
[24:37.270 --> 24:38.270]  What else we got?
[24:38.270 --> 24:39.270]  All right.
[24:39.270 --> 24:40.270]  So Holy crap.
[24:40.270 --> 24:44.590]  Uh, guys don't smoke as much as Clinton did, but smoke as much as I did.
[24:44.670 --> 24:46.270]  And that's, that's funny because that's a good example.
[24:46.270 --> 24:51.270]  I've probably consumed a, since Clint's been here, five dabs, I'm going to guess four or
[24:51.270 --> 24:56.350]  five dabs at least since Clint's been here for two puffs off of that bowl.
[24:56.350 --> 24:59.550]  And of course I've been smoking throughout the day, you know, it's seven o'clock almost.
[24:59.550 --> 25:01.870]  So I've probably had 12 dabs by now today.
[25:01.870 --> 25:04.870]  Oh, and I smoked a nothing all day today.
[25:04.870 --> 25:05.950]  And Clint is ruined.
[25:05.950 --> 25:08.630]  I'm not going to let Clint drive for at least another hour.
[25:08.630 --> 25:09.630]  Oh for sure.
[25:09.630 --> 25:14.270]  And, uh, I could pass any sobriety test that you needed me to right now.
[25:14.950 --> 25:15.950]  Yeah.
[25:15.950 --> 25:16.950]  Like I'm not even being a smart ass.
[25:16.950 --> 25:21.310]  I am going to burp, but I really could pass almost any sobriety test you offered me at
[25:21.310 --> 25:22.310]  this point.
[25:22.310 --> 25:23.310]  Yeah.
[25:23.310 --> 25:24.310]  Yeah.
[25:24.310 --> 25:26.270]  It's all about your body chemistry, uh, where you're used to being, where you're trying
[25:26.270 --> 25:29.430]  to be, how long your dreadlocks are, how long your dreadlocks are.
[25:29.430 --> 25:32.470]  Now it's funny dude, cause I've seen some people with dreads trying to be cool and they
[25:32.470 --> 25:33.470]  can't keep up at all.
[25:33.470 --> 25:35.830]  They think that cause they got the dreads, they're going to be able to party with me.
[25:35.830 --> 25:36.830]  I like that.
[25:36.830 --> 25:37.830]  Take a half gram dab.
[25:37.830 --> 25:38.830]  Let's see who you are.
[25:38.830 --> 25:39.830]  You're going to carry him to the couch.
[25:39.830 --> 25:40.830]  Yeah.
[25:40.830 --> 25:41.830]  All right.
[25:41.830 --> 25:45.070]  I'm going to drag him by the dreads right to the couch.
[25:45.070 --> 25:46.070]  Drag him out in the front yard.
[25:46.070 --> 25:50.430]  Somebody also sent me a message about trim machines.
[25:50.430 --> 25:52.430]  They said, how do you feel about trim machines?
[25:52.430 --> 25:55.870]  Uh, honestly, you're going to think I'm a prick, but fuck a trim machine.
[25:55.870 --> 25:57.470]  A trim machine ruins your trim.
[25:57.470 --> 26:00.630]  Uh, it chops up the, it makes a mess of your buds.
[26:00.630 --> 26:04.150]  Uh, high grade top shelf cannabis is hand trimmed.
[26:04.150 --> 26:07.710]  Uh, trim machines don't have fingers or eyes.
[26:07.710 --> 26:08.790]  They don't care.
[26:08.790 --> 26:10.110]  They don't put in love.
[26:10.110 --> 26:11.630]  Uh, they mingle the buds.
[26:12.430 --> 26:15.430]  I think if you've got a nice bud and you run it through a trim machine, it's not going
[26:15.430 --> 26:18.990]  to take off all the leaf in one spot and it will take off some of the bud in some spot.
[26:18.990 --> 26:20.030]  And this is from experience.
[26:20.030 --> 26:21.430]  I've helped other people use trim machines.
[26:21.430 --> 26:23.070]  We use the spin pro.
[26:23.070 --> 26:26.070]  I've seen the, uh, the grim or the trim Reaper.
[26:26.070 --> 26:27.750]  I've seen the tsunami thing.
[26:27.750 --> 26:29.950]  I don't like the way any of them work.
[26:29.950 --> 26:34.310]  Also what it does is it turns your trim into a mulch.
[26:34.310 --> 26:36.590]  It chops it up into this really funky mulch.
[26:36.590 --> 26:42.630]  And then it almost creates too many cuts so that the moisture seeps out of the leave
[26:42.630 --> 26:45.230]  the leaves or the trim in a weird way.
[26:45.230 --> 26:46.950]  And it doesn't, it'll, it'll mold up.
[26:46.950 --> 26:49.950]  There's almost no way to prevent that shit from turning moldy.
[26:49.950 --> 26:52.630]  So I like to hand trim that way.
[26:52.630 --> 26:57.190]  You can separate the big leaves from the good trim and you can know what you're making hash
[26:57.190 --> 27:00.310]  with and nobody's going to trim it like a person.
[27:00.310 --> 27:06.570]  Like, uh, at the dispensaries, they've got a whole crew of trimmers that hand trim everything.
[27:07.550 --> 27:09.410]  They don't go as quickly as a trimmer, but I think it's well worth it.
[27:09.410 --> 27:11.130]  You can see the difference.
[27:11.130 --> 27:14.530]  It's a whole bunch of like 22 to 28 year old people.
[27:14.530 --> 27:15.810]  They just want to trim all day.
[27:15.810 --> 27:18.650]  They're eager to get into the cannabis business and they just want to trim.
[27:18.650 --> 27:22.850]  So they just kick ass all day in hopes of getting promoted to a bud tender or a grower.
[27:22.850 --> 27:24.490]  And that's who does the trimming.
[27:24.490 --> 27:28.290]  I'd rather have those six or eight people sitting around trimming all day, every day
[27:28.290 --> 27:31.130]  than to trim machines running, honestly.
[27:31.130 --> 27:35.370]  So, uh, fucking auto trimmer, fucking trim machine, trim it by hand.
[27:35.370 --> 27:35.890]  Yeah.
[27:35.890 --> 27:36.730]  Use some scissors.
[27:36.770 --> 27:37.570]  Use your eyes.
[27:37.890 --> 27:38.770]  I don't want to trim.
[27:38.770 --> 27:40.530]  I got fucking carpal tunnel.
[27:40.610 --> 27:40.810]  Dude.
[27:40.810 --> 27:42.090]  I've got carpal tunnel.
[27:42.090 --> 27:43.130]  I got thumb calluses.
[27:43.130 --> 27:44.690]  I got four finger calluses.
[27:45.010 --> 27:46.850]  Uh, I got wrist sores just from trimming.
[27:46.930 --> 27:51.490]  I asked from just from my X-Box probably just from my X-Box probably
[27:51.490 --> 27:52.610]  trimmed a hundred pounds of weed.
[27:52.690 --> 27:54.570]  I don't know more than a hundred pounds of weed in my life.
[27:54.630 --> 27:56.810]  I'm pretty sure I've trimmed more than a hundred pounds by myself.
[27:57.650 --> 28:00.890]  Um, also there was a second half to that question that somebody emailed to me.
[28:01.370 --> 28:04.450]  Uh, the second half of that question is kind of lengthy and I'm going to have to do some
[28:04.450 --> 28:06.730]  research and give you a more thought out answer for that.
[28:07.010 --> 28:09.290]  I did not prepare enough time for that answer.
[28:09.330 --> 28:11.850]  It's a really good question and I will get back to you.
[28:11.850 --> 28:12.810]  I'm not blowing it off.
[28:12.850 --> 28:15.490]  That's just, I want to be accurate and a little more in depth for you.
[28:15.490 --> 28:17.330]  Cause that is a hell of a good question.
[28:18.090 --> 28:19.570]  Uh, let's see.
[28:19.650 --> 28:20.490]  Hey, you know, it'd be fun.
[28:20.730 --> 28:21.090]  What's up?
[28:21.330 --> 28:27.330]  Hey, if you, uh, if you put out the call where like, if maybe somebody, uh, like
[28:27.330 --> 28:30.690]  that listens as a friend that has like a really great weed story from like the
[28:30.690 --> 28:32.330]  seventies, do you know what I mean?
[28:32.370 --> 28:36.970]  Like, like one of those, like we had to get away from the cops kind of things
[28:36.970 --> 28:39.930]  like, and, and how, how, how great it is now.
[28:39.970 --> 28:41.170]  So you want me to get some Chong's on?
[28:41.290 --> 28:41.970]  Kinda.
[28:42.010 --> 28:42.370]  All right.
[28:42.410 --> 28:42.810]  That'd be fun.
[28:42.810 --> 28:43.370]  I don't know.
[28:43.410 --> 28:47.570]  I know a guy, uh, I'm actually his medical marijuana provider and he's an old cat.
[28:47.570 --> 28:49.250]  And he loves to tell me stories, bro.
[28:49.450 --> 28:49.850]  And you know what?
[28:49.850 --> 28:52.690]  I had him on the podcast one time on seven, one nine, the blocks.
[28:53.130 --> 28:56.330]  And I remember that when we put on the headphones on him and put the microphone
[28:56.330 --> 29:00.370]  in front of him, something lit up inside of him and his voice turned into like this.
[29:00.370 --> 29:03.130]  And he got all spectacular and charismatic.
[29:03.370 --> 29:05.370]  And at the end of the show, I was like, dude, have you done this before?
[29:05.370 --> 29:06.810]  And he goes, I did college radio, man.
[29:06.810 --> 29:08.490]  And there's nothing fucking like it, bro.
[29:08.810 --> 29:12.530]  And I was like, yeah, he was, this is college radio.
[29:12.530 --> 29:12.850]  Isn't it?
[29:12.850 --> 29:13.330]  It kind of is.
[29:13.330 --> 29:13.530]  Yeah.
[29:13.530 --> 29:15.570]  It's, it's our, it's a digital college radio now.
[29:15.570 --> 29:16.130]  This is weird.
[29:16.130 --> 29:18.450]  And then we got our like cult little followers and shit.
[29:18.450 --> 29:21.770]  And we'll listen and I, and I'm sure that's not for me, but I mean, that's,
[29:22.170 --> 29:23.490]  I'm here, so suck it.
[29:23.770 --> 29:28.650]  Uh, every guest, even though you're a dick, every guest that comes on, uh,
[29:28.810 --> 29:30.170]  brings their own audience.
[29:30.250 --> 29:32.810]  Like you'll, you'll retweet my tweet that you're on here.
[29:32.810 --> 29:35.330]  And then when I tweet that, Hey, tall Clint was on the show.
[29:35.570 --> 29:37.850]  I don't know, maybe one of your three Twitter followers.
[29:37.890 --> 29:38.090]  Yeah.
[29:38.090 --> 29:41.930]  I don't go, um, you know, but maybe if you have 10, maybe two of them will check
[29:41.930 --> 29:44.130]  out the show and one of them will probably like it.
[29:44.250 --> 29:44.450]  Yeah.
[29:44.450 --> 29:47.890]  So we'll get another listener and then we can bring Sam talent on and then, uh,
[29:48.130 --> 29:49.530]  and both cross paths.
[29:49.530 --> 29:51.610]  Cause I really want everybody to hear Sam talent.
[29:51.650 --> 29:52.490]  He's really funny.
[29:52.650 --> 29:52.810]  Yeah.
[29:52.810 --> 29:53.610]  We'll get him on the show.
[29:53.650 --> 29:54.250]  Invite him, dude.
[29:54.250 --> 29:54.930]  He'll be on the show.
[29:54.930 --> 29:57.810]  We'll tell him to come down pretty early, record 30 minutes and we'll put it out as
[29:57.850 --> 29:59.130]  one of those Thursday episodes.
[29:59.170 --> 29:59.850]  That's cool, man.
[30:00.130 --> 30:01.370]  Uh, thank you guys for listening, dude.
[30:01.410 --> 30:02.290]  I want to thank you guys all.
[30:02.290 --> 30:04.610]  We're just talking about our fans and our little cult following.
[30:04.610 --> 30:07.050]  And it really inspired me to say thank you because I haven't said that enough
[30:07.050 --> 30:07.450]  lately.
[30:07.730 --> 30:10.930]  I've been caught up in putting out a show and keeping the guest entertained and
[30:10.930 --> 30:12.730]  keeping the flow happening to our heaven.
[30:12.770 --> 30:14.250]  Uh, sincerely said, Holy shit.
[30:14.250 --> 30:14.810]  Thank you guys.
[30:14.810 --> 30:19.130]  We get so many downloads, so many listens, uh, the website traffic.
[30:19.250 --> 30:22.770]  I had to pay for more bandwidth on my website because you guys were killing it.
[30:22.770 --> 30:23.930]  Downloading episodes.
[30:24.650 --> 30:26.450]  The traffic on the website is exploding.
[30:26.970 --> 30:27.850]  Uh, it's going nuts.
[30:27.850 --> 30:31.690]  We had to fix the file type that I upload so that it's more available for
[30:31.690 --> 30:35.650]  stitcher, uh, because people were downloading it so much that it was slowing
[30:35.650 --> 30:37.730]  down the stitcher application on their phone.
[30:38.250 --> 30:40.850]  So I changed the file, the type, the type of file that I upload.
[30:40.850 --> 30:41.610]  It's a little smaller.
[30:41.610 --> 30:44.290]  It doesn't sound as good, but nobody's probably going to notice.
[30:44.290 --> 30:45.530]  It's just a voice podcast.
[30:45.530 --> 30:48.210]  It's not like we're putting out freaking dance music or anything.
[30:48.210 --> 30:51.930]  So, but yeah, people are listening and I really, really appreciate it.
[30:51.930 --> 30:52.490]  It's so amazing.
[30:52.490 --> 30:55.290]  You've told a friend, like we really appreciate that too.
[30:55.370 --> 30:55.610]  Yeah.
[30:55.890 --> 31:01.410]  You know, I told Drew and Dustin about this because I was like, no, this, I
[31:01.410 --> 31:02.690]  was really funny on this thing.
[31:02.690 --> 31:04.170]  I thought I was really funny back.
[31:04.170 --> 31:06.850]  Like, geez, I've been on this thing like eight times.
[31:06.850 --> 31:07.890]  It's probably your eighth time.
[31:07.890 --> 31:08.130]  Yeah.
[31:08.170 --> 31:10.090]  We're fucking, this is my favorite.
[31:11.970 --> 31:12.290]  Nice.
[31:12.290 --> 31:14.290]  The one that you crashed the fucking intro to.
[31:14.410 --> 31:15.010]  No, no, no.
[31:15.010 --> 31:17.410]  This, this just doing this podcast is fun.
[31:17.570 --> 31:17.770]  Nice.
[31:17.770 --> 31:18.450]  This is great, man.
[31:18.450 --> 31:19.170]  You look comfortable.
[31:19.170 --> 31:20.410]  You finally got your head bobbing.
[31:20.650 --> 31:20.970]  Yeah.
[31:20.970 --> 31:21.810]  Look at you loving it now.
[31:21.850 --> 31:22.650]  I feel good, man.
[31:22.810 --> 31:25.450]  No, I just, uh, it is nice, but it's nice.
[31:25.450 --> 31:28.970]  To tell one friend and then they tell one friend and then they tell one friends.
[31:28.970 --> 31:32.290]  That's all I'm asking is tell your friend about, uh, Sam talent.
[31:32.290 --> 31:33.570]  Tell your friends about, uh,
[31:36.730 --> 31:38.730]  no, Sam town's coming down to do the podcast.
[31:38.730 --> 31:39.330]  It's going to be awesome.
[31:39.850 --> 31:41.570]  I got to get people out to that show, man.
[31:42.490 --> 31:44.650]  It's so fucking, it's so ridiculous.
[31:44.690 --> 31:45.690]  It's life is on the line.
[31:45.690 --> 31:48.050]  If you guys don't go to the show, his life is going to fall apart.
[31:48.050 --> 31:48.450]  And I'm just kidding.
[31:48.570 --> 31:49.170]  Not really.
[31:49.810 --> 31:50.770]  It'll just suck.
[31:51.050 --> 31:51.330]  All right.
[31:51.730 --> 31:53.890]  So, uh, let's see, do I have any more notes that I want to
[31:53.890 --> 31:55.010]  talk about on today's episode?
[31:55.010 --> 31:58.290]  I think we can almost, uh, if you want to fucking ramble on about
[31:58.290 --> 32:00.770]  something for a couple of minutes, man, what's your, uh, how long,
[32:00.810 --> 32:01.810]  how long have we done now?
[32:01.850 --> 32:05.050]  We've gone 33 minutes, but I imagine that one to three
[32:05.050 --> 32:06.130]  minutes will be taken out.
[32:06.170 --> 32:08.410]  So we got about 30 minutes of usable material.
[32:08.410 --> 32:08.810]  Jesus.
[32:08.810 --> 32:10.970]  There was a, there was a depressing part in there too.
[32:10.970 --> 32:13.090]  I hope that does not make the podcast.
[32:13.090 --> 32:13.610]  Jesus.
[32:13.770 --> 32:15.890]  I'll make you look dignified before this comes out.
[32:15.930 --> 32:16.690]  That'd be really funny.
[32:16.690 --> 32:19.490]  If like, just during that part, you go, Clint wants you to come out to your,
[32:19.770 --> 32:22.650]  to the, to the show and like, you just edit that in
[32:23.610 --> 32:25.570]  just a bunch of mumbles.
[32:25.570 --> 32:26.850]  And then, yeah, please come to the show.
[32:26.970 --> 32:28.530]  Please come to Clint's show.
[32:28.610 --> 32:30.810]  I will apologize for this air conditioner.
[32:30.810 --> 32:33.170]  That's making a whole bunch of damn noise over my shoulder.
[32:33.170 --> 32:35.410]  I'm going to try to take that out of the recording, but I can hear it.
[32:35.410 --> 32:37.170]  Just going click, click, click, click, click in my head.
[32:37.170 --> 32:39.090]  And it's driving the producer in me.
[32:39.210 --> 32:40.410]  Absolutely bonkers.
[32:40.490 --> 32:41.370]  That's fucking rad, dude.
[32:41.370 --> 32:41.890]  That's good.
[32:42.010 --> 32:44.210]  I'm glad you got such a talent for this.
[32:44.290 --> 32:45.010]  Well, thank you, man.
[32:45.050 --> 32:45.610]  Thanks for dude.
[32:46.050 --> 32:49.570]  Uh, yeah, I've been doing, this is my 78th episode on this show.
[32:49.570 --> 32:51.610]  And then I did about 50 on another show.
[32:51.970 --> 32:54.330]  So I've had a little bit of practice and, uh, I think I
[32:54.330 --> 32:55.810]  finally got it figured out.
[32:56.170 --> 32:56.770]  That's cool, man.
[32:56.770 --> 32:59.770]  Took a minute, but thanks for noticing the, uh, the improvements that I've done.
[32:59.770 --> 33:02.450]  A lot of people have actually said that they've gone back and listened
[33:02.450 --> 33:05.530]  from episode number one up to whatever the current episode is.
[33:05.530 --> 33:06.050]  Yeah.
[33:06.130 --> 33:09.210]  And part of me makes my hang my, makes me hang my head in shame.
[33:09.210 --> 33:12.570]  Like, oh, you heard episodes one through five where I was like,
[33:12.570 --> 33:15.130]  not sure what I was doing at all.
[33:15.570 --> 33:20.170]  And then, but then I'm like, oh, but that means you also heard 75 where I knew
[33:20.170 --> 33:22.050]  everything that I was doing by now.
[33:22.050 --> 33:24.050]  Like, I don't know everything about a podcast, but I feel like I
[33:24.050 --> 33:25.130]  can come on here and do a show.
[33:25.130 --> 33:25.630]  Now.
[33:25.770 --> 33:28.010]  I don't know before it would take me three hours worth of getting stuff
[33:28.010 --> 33:31.170]  together and being nervous and three different takes of putting a show
[33:31.170 --> 33:33.050]  together and now I'm just like, what about podcast time?
[33:33.050 --> 33:33.550]  Let's kill it.
[33:33.730 --> 33:35.170]  See, that's fucking cool, man.
[33:35.250 --> 33:35.750]  That's neat.
[33:35.750 --> 33:36.250]  Then.
[33:36.250 --> 33:38.890]  And I'll bet those people that have listened to all of them, like, feel
[33:38.890 --> 33:39.970]  like they know you pretty well.
[33:40.170 --> 33:41.810]  Uh, and it's fun meeting those people.
[33:41.810 --> 33:43.810]  Cause some people come out of nowhere and they're like, dude, you're
[33:43.810 --> 33:45.690]  rostered, they'll hear my voice at the growth store.
[33:45.770 --> 33:46.090]  Right.
[33:46.090 --> 33:47.930]  Somebody was like, you're that guy on the podcast.
[33:47.970 --> 33:49.130]  And I was like, yeah, man, how'd you know that?
[33:49.130 --> 33:50.530]  Like I could recognize your voice.
[33:51.010 --> 33:51.890]  That's fucking awesome.
[33:51.930 --> 33:52.450]  Good to meet you.
[33:52.450 --> 33:53.410]  And I hang out with those guys.
[33:53.410 --> 33:54.850]  I go to their house and take dabs and shit.
[33:54.930 --> 33:55.430]  Yeah.
[33:55.690 --> 33:58.770]  No, but that's kind of what I'm saying is if you, if you listen,
[33:58.810 --> 34:01.410]  fucking let us know, dude, we're just human.
[34:01.530 --> 34:02.030]  Yeah.
[34:02.210 --> 34:02.710]  Yeah.
[34:02.810 --> 34:04.370]  I mean, it's all over Colorado, dude.
[34:04.370 --> 34:07.130]  I travel all over Colorado and I'll hang out and take dabs with you.
[34:07.130 --> 34:08.050]  I'm not afraid.
[34:08.050 --> 34:10.010]  I'm not worried if you're listening to the show, you're good people.
[34:10.050 --> 34:10.510]  I am.
[34:10.510 --> 34:12.410]  I am not taking dabs with anybody.
[34:12.450 --> 34:13.010]  Well, come on, Clint.
[34:13.050 --> 34:13.850]  You're all heathens.
[34:13.970 --> 34:17.650]  We'll come with me and he'll not take dabs and he'll sit there and stare
[34:17.650 --> 34:18.770]  at you judgmentally.
[34:18.850 --> 34:19.370]  That's right.
[34:19.370 --> 34:19.870]  I will.
[34:20.050 --> 34:21.130]  I'll be like your dad.
[34:21.290 --> 34:22.810]  You'd be looking at me like, God damn it.
[34:22.810 --> 34:26.010]  I wish that we hadn't brought Jeff's dad.
[34:26.010 --> 34:27.770]  And some dark glasses, bro.
[34:27.770 --> 34:29.010]  And you can just be my security guard.
[34:29.210 --> 34:29.970]  That's security.
[34:30.090 --> 34:31.330]  I just need a mustache.
[34:31.370 --> 34:32.290]  Just a mustache.
[34:32.290 --> 34:33.570]  Just a mustache.
[34:34.410 --> 34:35.850]  I got the hair for the seventies.
[34:35.850 --> 34:36.970]  So I think I could plan that.
[34:36.970 --> 34:39.210]  No, I wasn't going to mention your feathered seventies hair.
[34:39.210 --> 34:40.090]  What's with that, bro?
[34:40.090 --> 34:41.490]  Are you filming porn when you leave here?
[34:41.530 --> 34:43.610]  Yeah, I got a couple of things going.
[34:43.850 --> 34:46.770]  Um, since we're way, way off topic, that was fun.
[34:46.770 --> 34:48.410]  Would be your porn name anyway.
[34:48.530 --> 34:51.250]  Uh, Peter Frampton.
[34:52.010 --> 34:53.770]  I don't think that's available.
[34:53.810 --> 34:56.170]  I think this screen name is not available.
[34:56.290 --> 34:57.450]  That'd be fucking fun though.
[34:57.450 --> 34:58.530]  Peter Frampton underscore.
[35:03.730 --> 35:04.970]  Uh, I like that.
[35:05.010 --> 35:05.510]  Yeah.
[35:06.570 --> 35:07.730]  It's spelled the word underscore.
[35:07.770 --> 35:10.810]  Nah, I was thinking about it and I was like, no, cause then that's a pain in the
[35:10.810 --> 35:13.850]  ass and then you can't get the Twitter handle cause it's too long.
[35:14.250 --> 35:14.750]  Yeah.
[35:14.750 --> 35:15.250]  Okay.
[35:15.250 --> 35:15.750]  You're right.
[35:15.750 --> 35:16.690]  Peter Frampton underscore.
[35:17.130 --> 35:19.050]  Oh, do you feel like I do?
[35:19.210 --> 35:19.710]  All right.
[35:19.710 --> 35:20.410]  I do what I can.
[35:20.490 --> 35:22.090]  I like fucking Peter Frampton though.
[35:22.090 --> 35:22.650]  That would be great.
[35:22.650 --> 35:24.130]  I bet it sells some porn still.
[35:24.490 --> 35:24.990]  Maybe.
[35:25.210 --> 35:27.490]  I'll, and then the next one, I'm Brett Michaels.
[35:27.490 --> 35:28.570]  Frampton comes alive.
[35:28.650 --> 35:29.290]  Oh God.
[35:29.330 --> 35:29.690]  Yeah.
[35:29.690 --> 35:30.810]  See, see, you got it.
[35:31.010 --> 35:31.570]  We got it.
[35:31.690 --> 35:32.410]  Uh, all right.
[35:32.450 --> 35:33.010]  We're winning.
[35:33.090 --> 35:35.050]  We're going to wrap up this show here really soon.
[35:35.050 --> 35:36.810]  It's almost seven 10 in Colorado.
[35:36.890 --> 35:37.610]  Oh shit.
[35:37.650 --> 35:38.050]  Yeah.
[35:38.090 --> 35:39.370]  Big shout out to the wild cousins.
[35:39.370 --> 35:41.890]  Big shout out to Clint for coming on the show and getting way too high.
[35:41.930 --> 35:42.730]  I appreciate that.
[35:42.730 --> 35:43.250]  That's fun.
[35:43.250 --> 35:47.250]  That was the answer to your question is just don't get too high and do a podcast.
[35:47.290 --> 35:47.570]  Yeah.
[35:47.610 --> 35:50.770]  Don't be recorded while you're super high because you may say some shit that you
[35:50.770 --> 35:51.290]  regret.
[35:51.330 --> 35:52.650]  I'm not going to regret any of that.
[35:52.650 --> 35:55.250]  Hopefully your friend is the producer and he'll take all of it out for you.
[35:55.330 --> 35:56.730]  I don't think I'm going to regret anything.
[35:56.890 --> 35:57.390]  All right.
[35:57.890 --> 35:58.890]  I didn't say anything stupid.
[35:58.930 --> 35:59.430]  You're good.
[35:59.530 --> 36:02.050]  Hey, I've been doing this thing called Periscope.
[36:02.090 --> 36:05.050]  Periscope is an app that you can get on your phone, either your iPhone or your
[36:05.050 --> 36:06.050]  Android device.
[36:06.410 --> 36:07.810]  Uh, just go download Periscope.
[36:08.170 --> 36:10.930]  And then what you could do is, uh, follow me.
[36:10.970 --> 36:13.410]  I'm at Rasta Jeff four 20 on Periscope.
[36:13.850 --> 36:17.810]  Uh, occasionally more than occasionally, at least once, maybe twice a day, I jump
[36:17.810 --> 36:23.210]  on Periscope and I will do a live video, uh, where I sit here in the recording
[36:23.210 --> 36:23.530]  area.
[36:23.530 --> 36:24.650]  It does drugs.
[36:24.690 --> 36:25.370]  I do drugs.
[36:25.370 --> 36:26.850]  I take big fat dabs.
[36:27.130 --> 36:31.050]  Sometimes I take my morning dabs or my afternoon dabs, whatever the first puff
[36:31.050 --> 36:32.810]  session of the day is I'll get on Periscope.
[36:32.850 --> 36:33.370]  Rugs.
[36:33.410 --> 36:34.850]  Take a few dabs with you guys.
[36:35.130 --> 36:38.170]  Uh, talk a little bit of wisdom, drop some knowledge on you guys.
[36:38.170 --> 36:39.130]  I'll answer a few questions.
[36:39.130 --> 36:40.770]  If you type it in the question box.
[36:41.130 --> 36:45.410]  And once I get good at recording the show, setting the phone here in front of the
[36:45.410 --> 36:49.690]  computer, getting on Periscope and forgetting that Periscope is going.
[36:50.370 --> 36:53.290]  Uh, and still paying attention to the chat and Periscope.
[36:53.570 --> 36:57.930]  I will start doing a live show on Periscope as I record.
[36:58.650 --> 37:01.250]  So you guys are on Periscope with me.
[37:01.250 --> 37:04.330]  We'll be able to ask me questions live and I'll be able to read them on the screen.
[37:04.690 --> 37:08.530]  I will read the question aloud into the microphone and I'd be like, so tall.
[37:08.530 --> 37:10.610]  Clint says, how come you don't ever brush your hair?
[37:10.610 --> 37:11.770]  And then I'll answer the question.
[37:12.490 --> 37:14.130]  Did I hear that so much on Periscope?
[37:14.130 --> 37:15.570]  It's really, there's a lot of trolls.
[37:15.610 --> 37:16.730]  Oh, I'm troll proof, dude.
[37:16.970 --> 37:19.170]  Well, I should have not just said that on the podcast because now they
[37:19.170 --> 37:20.490]  want to challenge my troll game.
[37:21.130 --> 37:23.490]  I am troll proof on Periscope.
[37:23.530 --> 37:24.410]  It's my page.
[37:24.650 --> 37:25.570]  I know I'm dirty.
[37:25.810 --> 37:26.530]  Yeah, I know.
[37:26.530 --> 37:28.290]  I got dreadlocks, whatever.
[37:28.530 --> 37:30.170]  You're not going to fucking make me cry.
[37:30.250 --> 37:33.330]  Well, that's the thing is nobody's ever said anything original anymore.
[37:33.370 --> 37:34.050]  That's the truth.
[37:34.050 --> 37:36.610]  I mean, that's, that's, I'm always like, Oh, heard that.
[37:36.890 --> 37:37.210]  Yeah.
[37:37.210 --> 37:37.690]  Heard that.
[37:37.690 --> 37:39.650]  That's, that's tough about comedy too.
[37:39.730 --> 37:41.610]  That's because there's a lot of jokes that have been done.
[37:41.610 --> 37:44.850]  That's why, you know, we're just trying to do new stuff.
[37:45.490 --> 37:46.250]  That's all it is.
[37:46.410 --> 37:49.010]  But troll proof is fucking awesome.
[37:49.090 --> 37:52.290]  Troll proof that I should make a screen name or something that's troll proof.
[37:52.290 --> 37:53.290]  Cause I feel like I'm troll proof.
[37:53.290 --> 37:54.210]  I'm a grown ass man.
[37:54.210 --> 37:55.330]  I'm not a little kid.
[37:55.410 --> 37:57.090]  I'm quite secure with myself.
[37:57.690 --> 38:00.810]  Uh, do troll proof on Periscope right now.
[38:01.650 --> 38:04.890]  Just type it in as the thing and then have everybody just say mean things that
[38:04.890 --> 38:05.930]  you, that'd be a lot of fun.
[38:06.530 --> 38:07.290]  Not on the show though.
[38:07.490 --> 38:07.690]  Yeah.
[38:07.690 --> 38:08.690]  We'll do that right after.
[38:08.730 --> 38:09.490]  Look for us.
[38:11.370 --> 38:12.130]  This is stupid.
[38:12.330 --> 38:12.530]  Yeah.
[38:12.530 --> 38:14.810]  Make sure you guys check me out on Periscope once in a while though, because
[38:14.810 --> 38:18.050]  I come on late at night, early in the morning, random times, just take fat dabs.
[38:18.170 --> 38:22.530]  I'm on a really weird schedule being employed and self-employed, uh, and
[38:22.530 --> 38:25.530]  being a producer of a show, my hours are really random.
[38:25.530 --> 38:28.490]  I go to bed around four in the morning and get up around like somewhere between
[38:28.490 --> 38:29.970]  nine and 10, sometimes 11.
[38:30.010 --> 38:33.690]  If I'm lucky, uh, the sun comes up and I just start getting up and doing shit, man.
[38:33.690 --> 38:34.890]  It's the way it's gotta be done.
[38:34.930 --> 38:35.130]  Yeah.
[38:35.130 --> 38:36.530]  You gotta hustle quite often.
[38:36.530 --> 38:37.490]  I'm up by nine o'clock.
[38:37.490 --> 38:39.490]  Cause some of the grill lights come on at nine shit.
[38:39.490 --> 38:41.170]  Sometimes I gotta be at the spot by eight.
[38:41.210 --> 38:41.490]  Shit.
[38:41.490 --> 38:43.090]  I gotta get a fucking job, man.
[38:43.170 --> 38:43.770]  Jesus.
[38:43.850 --> 38:44.410]  Yeah.
[38:44.530 --> 38:45.330]  The shit sucks.
[38:45.370 --> 38:45.730]  Yeah.
[38:45.770 --> 38:47.490]  Clint had a great comedy set.
[38:47.490 --> 38:51.730]  One day Clint got, uh, he got relieved of his position as it, at his spot of
[38:51.730 --> 38:55.490]  employment and then we drove up and watched him do comedy and that comedy
[38:55.490 --> 38:56.690]  set was quite awkward.
[38:56.810 --> 38:58.210]  Yeah, for sure.
[38:58.250 --> 39:00.850]  I felt like I was the wife that was about to get beat because you were
[39:00.850 --> 39:02.050]  the husband that lost his job.
[39:02.090 --> 39:03.130]  I was pretty mad that day.
[39:03.170 --> 39:05.690]  I could tell, but we were doing everything we could to put you in a better head.
[39:05.770 --> 39:06.570]  Now you guys did good.
[39:06.610 --> 39:10.010]  You look like you're in a much better space than like 40 minutes ago.
[39:10.210 --> 39:15.130]  Yeah, no, we're just, uh, no, everybody's all in this all together, man.
[39:15.170 --> 39:16.610]  Everything's happening for a reason.
[39:16.810 --> 39:17.490]  That's what I believe.
[39:17.570 --> 39:18.570]  That's the damn truth.
[39:18.570 --> 39:18.970]  You guys.
[39:19.090 --> 39:19.410]  All right.
[39:19.690 --> 39:20.610]  We're going to wrap up this show.
[39:20.610 --> 39:22.330]  We've been rambling for 40 minutes.
[39:22.330 --> 39:23.610]  We warned you immediately.
[39:23.610 --> 39:25.970]  I warned you immediately too.
[39:26.410 --> 39:28.090]  He didn't warn me as the problem.
[39:28.570 --> 39:30.650]  He got the warning at the same time.
[39:30.690 --> 39:35.890]  Jeff got the front of this one because you guys had the opportunity to not listen to
[39:35.890 --> 39:37.610]  this and I'm going to edit some of this out.
[39:37.650 --> 39:41.850]  So he's going to have to listen to this again twice because I'll listen to it as I
[39:41.850 --> 39:42.290]  edit it.
[39:42.290 --> 39:45.690]  And then when it's complete, I'll give it one full, complete listen through just to
[39:45.690 --> 39:49.490]  make sure it's, yeah, it doesn't sound shitty or I didn't do any hard P's or
[39:49.490 --> 39:50.130]  anything like that.
[39:50.450 --> 39:52.050]  I don't even fix the hard P's and S's.
[39:52.050 --> 39:53.930]  I think the software does most of that for me.
[39:54.010 --> 39:54.330]  Really?
[39:54.490 --> 39:55.050]  That's pretty cool.
[39:55.090 --> 39:55.890]  I bought good shit.
[39:55.930 --> 39:56.370]  I don't know.
[39:56.370 --> 39:58.050]  I'm just saying that's cool that you're getting help.
[39:58.330 --> 39:59.130]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[39:59.170 --> 40:00.450]  Well, I got this piece over here.
[40:00.450 --> 40:01.450]  I got this piece over here.
[40:01.450 --> 40:02.490]  I got my daughter call me.
[40:02.490 --> 40:03.970]  So you want me to turn down your mic?
[40:04.090 --> 40:04.690]  Yeah, cool.
[40:04.690 --> 40:05.090]  Here you go.
[40:05.130 --> 40:05.610]  All right guys.
[40:05.810 --> 40:06.450]  Oh wait, was that him?
[40:06.490 --> 40:06.690]  No.
[40:06.770 --> 40:06.970]  Yeah.
[40:07.050 --> 40:07.290]  Cool.
[40:07.530 --> 40:08.410]  I'm going to wrap up the show.
[40:08.490 --> 40:09.690]  Clint's got to step away for a second.
[40:09.730 --> 40:10.410]  Perfect timing.
[40:10.810 --> 40:12.890]  Um, I got to find the paper.
[40:12.930 --> 40:13.210]  All right.
[40:13.610 --> 40:15.530]  Uh, you guys, now the show's over.
[40:15.570 --> 40:16.370]  Go to iTunes.
[40:16.770 --> 40:18.530]  Uh, search for the grow from your heart podcast.
[40:18.530 --> 40:19.290]  Find the review section.
[40:19.290 --> 40:20.170]  Give me a five star rating.
[40:20.170 --> 40:23.050]  After that type in a comment, let me know what you think of the show and I will read
[40:23.050 --> 40:24.570]  your comment on a future episode.
[40:24.930 --> 40:27.690]  Uh, you can leave a comment on stitcher if you'd like, but it's really hard to find
[40:27.690 --> 40:28.170]  the comments.
[40:28.170 --> 40:31.250]  I will go and look, but stitcher is really weird.
[40:31.570 --> 40:34.970]  So, um, find me on all the social media sites, please.
[40:34.970 --> 40:35.690]  I'm on Facebook.
[40:35.690 --> 40:37.610]  It's at growth or it's worth my heart podcast.
[40:38.010 --> 40:38.650]  I'm on Twitter.
[40:38.650 --> 40:42.010]  It's a at GFYH podcast, or it's just at GFYH.
[40:42.370 --> 40:43.610]  No, it's at GFYH podcast.
[40:43.610 --> 40:43.970]  I'm sorry.
[40:44.610 --> 40:47.730]  Uh, follow I read genetics on Instagram.
[40:47.770 --> 40:51.250]  Don't forget that the show's available on iTunes stitcher and every single episode
[40:51.250 --> 40:52.210]  is archived on irie.
[40:52.210 --> 40:53.770]  Genetics, colorado.com.
[40:54.010 --> 40:55.650]  Clint has jumped back on the microphone.
[40:55.650 --> 40:56.450]  Is everything cool, brother?
[40:56.530 --> 40:56.770]  Yeah.
[40:56.770 --> 40:57.450]  Everything's great.
[40:57.450 --> 40:59.490]  It's just when, when your daughter calls you, you answer.
[40:59.530 --> 41:00.570]  I totally understand.
[41:00.570 --> 41:01.410]  I've got one myself.
[41:01.410 --> 41:04.170]  I've been bragging about her birthday on the past couple episodes and if she called
[41:04.170 --> 41:05.530]  right now, we would talk to her.
[41:05.570 --> 41:05.930]  Yeah.
[41:06.010 --> 41:06.290]  Yeah.
[41:06.330 --> 41:07.970]  No, that's what, that's, that's the thing.
[41:07.970 --> 41:08.930]  I got a nine year old.
[41:09.010 --> 41:09.290]  Yeah.
[41:09.330 --> 41:10.290]  That's what dads do, bro.
[41:10.370 --> 41:11.530]  That's what we're supposed to do.
[41:11.530 --> 41:12.490]  Answer when the girl calls.
[41:12.570 --> 41:12.810]  Yeah.
[41:12.810 --> 41:16.370]  I appreciate all your fans and everything, but that's the one thing that's going to
[41:16.370 --> 41:16.690]  stop.
[41:16.690 --> 41:17.410]  No, for sure.
[41:17.490 --> 41:17.810]  Yeah.
[41:18.050 --> 41:20.570]  Not many things that we stopped recording for, but the daughters.
[41:20.770 --> 41:21.090]  Yeah.
[41:21.170 --> 41:21.490]  Yeah.
[41:21.530 --> 41:22.330]  Aren't that great?
[41:22.530 --> 41:23.890]  We're actually good people too.
[41:24.890 --> 41:26.210]  He's a fucking dirty hippie.
[41:26.210 --> 41:30.170]  I'm a foul mouthed sailor of a like person.
[41:30.530 --> 41:31.090]  I don't know.
[41:31.210 --> 41:32.930]  What's, what was the analogy I was going for there?
[41:33.010 --> 41:33.570]  A comedian.
[41:33.890 --> 41:34.970]  Oh, like as a dick.
[41:36.450 --> 41:36.570]  Yeah.
[41:36.570 --> 41:40.130]  Um, but, but the little ones first, bro, cause that's, yeah.
[41:40.610 --> 41:41.370]  We need to make this.
[41:41.410 --> 41:42.890]  Can you edit out all the fucks?
[41:43.490 --> 41:44.170]  Fuck no.
[41:44.530 --> 41:48.850]  I, back in the day I did what was called the, uh, the dollar fuck jar and the money
[41:48.850 --> 41:50.010]  got donated to somebody.
[41:50.050 --> 41:52.890]  Actually, the money is sitting somewhere and that dude has not contacted me.
[41:52.890 --> 41:54.410]  So he doesn't listen to the show anymore.
[41:54.410 --> 41:58.690]  So my fault, but, uh, speaking of money, there's a donation button on the podcast
[41:58.690 --> 41:59.090]  page.
[41:59.370 --> 42:02.330]  Uh, if you go to the website, it's I read genetics, colorado.com.
[42:02.330 --> 42:03.850]  Click on the growth from your heart podcast tab.
[42:03.850 --> 42:04.290]  It's top right.
[42:04.290 --> 42:07.810]  There's a donation button, a little PayPal logo that goes directly to my PayPal
[42:07.810 --> 42:08.130]  account.
[42:08.170 --> 42:08.970]  Guys, I'm not begging you.
[42:08.970 --> 42:10.090]  I'm just letting you know, it's there.
[42:10.290 --> 42:12.330]  The podcast is always going to be free.
[42:12.330 --> 42:14.730]  This comes to you from me as a gift.
[42:14.730 --> 42:15.530]  Cause I love you.
[42:15.530 --> 42:16.370]  I love cannabis.
[42:16.410 --> 42:18.010]  I want you to grow better cannabis.
[42:18.410 --> 42:22.530]  I want to break the stigma and fears associated with cannabis.
[42:22.850 --> 42:24.770]  Um, I want to help out the plant.
[42:24.770 --> 42:25.570]  I want to free the plant.
[42:25.810 --> 42:29.730]  So, uh, this is all free, but if you do feel like making a contribution, I would
[42:29.730 --> 42:30.010]  love it.
[42:30.010 --> 42:31.090]  I'd give you a shout out on the show.
[42:31.090 --> 42:31.850]  I'd say, thank you.
[42:32.330 --> 42:36.410]  Uh, just go to the website, click on the PayPal thing, throw in however much you
[42:36.410 --> 42:37.210]  feel like you'd like to.
[42:37.210 --> 42:38.370]  I'm not begging, but it's there.
[42:38.850 --> 42:41.090]  Uh, like I said, run all the social media sites.
[42:41.610 --> 42:43.530]  Um, Clint, thanks for coming, dude.
[42:43.610 --> 42:44.490]  That was fun, dude.
[42:44.530 --> 42:45.170]  It was a lot of fun.
[42:45.210 --> 42:47.290]  I'll bet your fans fucking hate me now.
[42:47.370 --> 42:50.050]  Oh no, they're only going to get like 30 minutes of your ear bashing.
[42:50.050 --> 42:50.770]  So it'll be okay.
[42:50.810 --> 42:51.810]  That was brutal.
[42:53.050 --> 42:54.210]  You guys, thanks for tolerating Clint.
[42:54.210 --> 42:55.850]  I promise he won't be on the next episode.
[42:56.210 --> 42:57.850]  We won't have him back for a few episodes.
[42:57.850 --> 42:59.610]  We'll get Spence here pretty soon.
[43:00.050 --> 43:02.610]  I'm trying to get a few other new people on the show.
[43:02.850 --> 43:04.970]  I've got a lot of news lined up for the next episode.
[43:05.010 --> 43:06.770]  There's already stuff in the works.
[43:06.930 --> 43:09.490]  I'm trying to get shirts made by episode 100.
[43:10.090 --> 43:11.770]  Uh, there's a lot of stuff going on.
[43:12.530 --> 43:12.970]  Yeah.
[43:13.210 --> 43:13.450]  All right.
[43:13.730 --> 43:15.970]  So a shout out to my ninja Spence until next time.
[43:16.010 --> 43:16.770]  Thanks again for listening.
[43:16.770 --> 43:17.650]  Take a fat dab.
[43:18.130 --> 43:19.130]  Give your mom a hug for me.
[43:46.770 --> 43:49.370]  I can't sweat it all the time because it makes me sing.
[43:49.410 --> 43:51.810]  Sometimes I hate to think it's just another page of ink.
[43:52.010 --> 43:54.450]  Still scared to fly sitting in my bird's nest.
[43:54.450 --> 43:57.170]  Never dared to try, but the sky is where you're heard best.
[43:57.490 --> 43:58.530]  I deserve less.
[43:58.690 --> 44:02.450]  I never thought I'd say it, but too many people in my life have bought and paid it.
[44:02.650 --> 44:04.970]  Often waited for a handout to come to me.
[44:05.090 --> 44:07.650]  Thought I had my plans now mapped out comfortably.
[44:08.010 --> 44:10.250]  Getting older now, that isn't who I want to be.
[44:10.250 --> 44:12.850]  Looking in the mirror, I'm unaware of what's in front of me.
[44:13.130 --> 44:15.370]  I got a ton to see and I ain't getting younger.
[44:15.850 --> 44:18.090]  Deciding not to jump was my biggest blunder.
[44:18.210 --> 44:18.490]  Yeah.
[44:18.730 --> 44:20.610]  I sit and wonder about what could have been.
[44:20.890 --> 44:23.850]  And instead of jealous hate these days, I say good for him.
[44:23.850 --> 44:24.890]  Fuck this shit, you right.
[44:24.890 --> 44:26.570]  Cause all of that stuff is worthless.
[44:26.570 --> 44:29.170]  If your shit ain't tight, then tell me, what's the purpose?
[44:29.490 --> 44:31.490]  Me and Phil, we was wanting a hundred verses.
[44:31.490 --> 44:34.370]  Now if y'all are underground, we're working above the surface.
[44:34.370 --> 44:35.410]  Fuck this shit, you right.
[44:35.410 --> 44:36.930]  Cause all of that stuff is worthless.
[44:36.930 --> 44:39.690]  And if your shit ain't tight, then tell me, what's the purpose?
[44:39.970 --> 44:42.250]  Me and Taz, we was wanting a hundred verses.
[44:42.250 --> 44:44.970]  If y'all are underground, we're working above the surface.
[44:45.650 --> 44:47.530]  Everything I see keeps changing.
[44:47.530 --> 44:50.290]  Afraid of the day life sweeps me away with it.
[44:50.770 --> 44:52.810]  My old friends seem like strangers.
[44:52.810 --> 44:55.610]  I'm cold and alone, but I think I'm okay with it.
[44:55.970 --> 45:00.610]  My mind says no, don't give in on a solo mission to be oh so different.
[45:00.930 --> 45:03.130]  I make mistakes, but I don't go fix it.
[45:03.130 --> 45:05.730]  Bounce from place to place like I'm Pogo stickin'.
[45:05.730 --> 45:07.330]  Started when I was a little kid.
[45:07.330 --> 45:08.970]  I don't know when it'll stop.
[45:08.970 --> 45:11.050]  Maybe never, cause change is forever.
[45:11.050 --> 45:12.370]  Evolution of man.
[45:12.370 --> 45:13.650]  So it makes me better.
[45:13.650 --> 45:16.290]  Executing my plans until my plate sees cheddar.
[45:16.290 --> 45:18.930]  Not a mainstream rapper, just an AC setter.
[45:18.930 --> 45:21.610]  That's a crazy cracker with amazing effort.
[45:22.090 --> 45:27.130]  And though I know it'd be nice to be filthy rich and have 26 kids with a milfy chick.
[45:27.370 --> 45:29.810]  I really think I'd rather stick with this music shit.
[45:29.810 --> 45:32.530]  Even if it's underground, unreleased, exclusive shit.
[45:32.970 --> 45:35.290]  Cause music's got me feeling like a million bucks.
[45:35.290 --> 45:37.810]  And having children right now would have me feeling stuck.
[45:38.130 --> 45:40.730]  4am, bills out to wreck downtown.
[45:40.730 --> 45:43.050]  By 7 I'm still out to get clout.
[45:43.050 --> 45:45.650]  Bills bout to spill out, correct sound.
[45:45.650 --> 45:48.370]  Sick of beat makers with build ups to let down.
[45:48.810 --> 45:53.410]  And even though I know I speak intelligent, I still think this shit is my weakest element.
[45:53.770 --> 45:56.090]  I'm mostly known as that graffiti felling kid.
[45:56.090 --> 45:58.770]  And every MC knows that my beats are hella sick.
[45:59.050 --> 46:00.770]  I get bucked wild often.
[46:00.770 --> 46:04.050]  I can chew gum while I'm walking, shoot guns while coughing.
[46:04.410 --> 46:09.450]  Mom, I know you're worrying, but don't blow a barge in your garden to burn me a po-po.
[46:10.290 --> 46:14.210]  I don't like police or this malevolent machine foolish, sheisty beast.
[46:14.210 --> 46:16.330]  I'll hit that bullseye blindfolded.
[46:16.330 --> 46:18.810]  Quite focused on the rise like Ys the beast.
[46:18.810 --> 46:21.490]  It's my mode, I'm devoted to being loaded.
[46:21.490 --> 46:23.170]  Or at least noticed.
[46:23.170 --> 46:25.530]  Noted, this whole scene's bogus.
[46:25.530 --> 46:28.170]  Every track I collab, my 16's dopest.
[46:28.170 --> 46:30.770]  Even my weakest piece of shit is so sick.
[46:30.770 --> 46:32.090]  I should go and name this song.
[46:32.130 --> 46:33.090]  I'm on my own, dig?
[46:33.090 --> 46:35.850]  Hit me on my phone if you want your poems ghost written.
[46:36.090 --> 46:37.930]  Yeah, standard fees apply.
[46:37.930 --> 46:39.410]  Can't read or write raps.
[46:39.410 --> 46:40.690]  Try these for size.
