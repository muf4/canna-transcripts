[00:00.000 --> 00:16.640]  Yo, what's up, ladies and gentlemen? It's time for episode number 36 of the I Grow Culture
[00:16.640 --> 00:21.200]  Podcast. They call me Rasta Jeff and I'm your host. Joining me at the table today, we got
[00:21.200 --> 00:25.600]  our good buddies, Tal Clint. Hey, guys. And our good buddy, Nemo Punk. What's up, folks?
[00:25.600 --> 00:29.400]  It's actually Mike over there, but try to advertise his Twitter a little bit. Goddamn
[00:29.400 --> 00:33.320]  nice. Temp the Twitter. Music's too loud. Temp the Twitter. Wow. Who put the music so
[00:33.320 --> 00:36.760]  high? Geez. All right. How are you guys doing tonight? I'm great, brother. How are you?
[00:36.760 --> 00:39.680]  You look like you're in a great mood, bro. You got a big old smile over there. It's because
[00:39.680 --> 00:43.400]  it's Thursday. It's Thursday. Thursdays have been great for us lately. I don't know why.
[00:43.400 --> 00:46.760]  Thursdays have been pretty damn good. How you doing tonight, Mike? I'm doing pretty
[00:46.760 --> 00:52.320]  good. It's been a stressful but fantastic week. It's been a very stressful week. Man,
[00:52.320 --> 00:57.160]  speaking of stressful, I owe you a huge thank you. Guys, we've talked about these city council
[00:57.160 --> 01:01.800]  meetings for the past few episodes. Dude, Mike, I thought he was going to stand. They've
[01:01.800 --> 01:06.200]  got a nice little seat for you there, like a real cushy chair and a microphone. You look
[01:06.200 --> 01:12.960]  like a boss. It's nice. Mike presented a nice statement to city council. He actually
[01:12.960 --> 01:16.960]  had some success in what he was trying to do. We'll talk about that a little bit because
[01:16.960 --> 01:20.320]  I really want to spend some time on the city council meeting topic. There's a lot of stuff
[01:20.320 --> 01:27.680]  to talk about there. Yeah. It's been a crazy week in marijuana ordinance news, I suppose.
[01:27.680 --> 01:31.920]  We'll get to that in a few minutes, folks. We for sure will. We talked about this a little
[01:31.920 --> 01:37.280]  bit on the last episode, but Clint wasn't here. Clint and I got to go see Joey Coco
[01:37.280 --> 01:43.080]  Diaz. Joey Diaz. Joey Diaz. I skipped a part I really want to say. Also, today we are celebrating
[01:43.080 --> 01:48.440]  Clint's eighth year anniversary of sobriety from alcohol. Yeah. Way to go, man. Dude.
[01:48.440 --> 01:52.520]  Thanks, guys. Congrats. Seriously. You said it's nothing to toot about, but that is. Eight
[01:52.520 --> 01:57.800]  years is that strong. It's easy now. Yeah. Yeah. We just talked before. Yeah, I'm sure.
[01:57.800 --> 02:00.480]  Well, congrats, bro. Thanks for sticking with it because I don't think we'd hang out if
[02:00.480 --> 02:03.640]  you were the drunk you were before. Oh, I was a piece of shit. I mean, I'm still a piece
[02:03.640 --> 02:08.920]  of shit. I just don't showcase it as much. Yeah. Alcohol really displays your shitty
[02:08.920 --> 02:12.200]  side, doesn't it? Fuck yeah. That's why I don't drink, too. That's why I don't drink.
[02:12.200 --> 02:18.120]  I've seen the South Park. I'm like trash now. I'm in trouble. Pretty much anything under
[02:18.120 --> 02:22.200]  wraps until you get a couple of beers in you and then all of the demons come just pouring
[02:22.200 --> 02:26.160]  out. That was my thing. That's the thing. It's a depressant. It is a depressant. It
[02:26.160 --> 02:31.040]  doesn't help me much. You know, I quit drinking when I got my medical marijuana card and I
[02:31.040 --> 02:34.800]  my life is easier, happier when I wake up. I know where my money is. I know where my
[02:34.800 --> 02:41.840]  car is parked. I appreciate it. I still drink occasionally like I'll have a dose, but for
[02:41.840 --> 02:47.360]  the most part I quit like five or six years back just because I got really good at throwing
[02:47.360 --> 02:53.960]  up in bars. And I distinctly remember walking up a flight of stairs. It was the Celtic in
[02:53.960 --> 02:58.600]  downtown Denver thinking like, yeah, man, like you didn't get any on you. You're a pro.
[02:58.600 --> 03:02.320]  And I got about halfway up the stairs and it dawned on me that that's not something
[03:02.320 --> 03:09.160]  I wanted to be pro at. Like, yeah, this is just one of those like now I feel weird because
[03:09.160 --> 03:14.400]  I'm like twenty five and all my social life revolves around the bars and the bar scene.
[03:14.400 --> 03:20.440]  And it was a little weird to step out of that for a while. But now it's just where I live.
[03:20.440 --> 03:24.800]  Alcohol doesn't play a big role. Yeah. Once I moved away from my party town, it was a
[03:24.800 --> 03:28.520]  lot easier for me to quit drinking. I lived in Lawrence, Kansas for a little while, and
[03:28.520 --> 03:32.640]  it's just really easy to be a Spuny in there. And then I came here where there's a lot of
[03:32.640 --> 03:36.440]  drinking and I know everybody. So that sucked me in a little bit. But once I realized what
[03:36.440 --> 03:41.920]  I was doing, I just gave it up. I can smoke all the weed I can handle. I took a gram dab
[03:41.920 --> 03:46.040]  last night. Like, why would I even need alcohol in my life at all? He's going to do another
[03:46.040 --> 03:49.880]  one tonight. I'm going to do it again tonight. I feel myself taking a gram dab last night
[03:49.880 --> 03:53.960]  and the video was very disappointing. I put the dab on the dabber kind of wonky and it
[03:53.960 --> 03:58.200]  just it wasn't real. That was not an impressive video. It's going to try it again. It'd be
[03:58.200 --> 04:02.640]  a fun video if we could have like the count from Sesame Street, like photoshopped in there
[04:02.640 --> 04:08.840]  on one down to down. It took me several inhales and exhales to get that dab just partially
[04:08.840 --> 04:12.040]  because the way I dropped it on the nail, I didn't time it right. It was my breath and
[04:12.040 --> 04:17.320]  it was the dab. Right. Get the right nail. Yeah. Rig. You were using a teeny rig. I love
[04:17.320 --> 04:21.640]  the practice. Big dab on a teeny rig, dude. There's something about it. Something about
[04:21.640 --> 04:25.560]  it. Speaking of big dabs on teeny rigs, this podcast is brought to you by our good friends
[04:25.560 --> 04:29.760]  at Cannabis Grand Crew. What's Grand Crew, you ask? You got to check out the website
[04:29.760 --> 04:36.400]  CannabisGrandCrew.com. It's spelled Grand C R U like the Motley Crew. It is a private
[04:36.400 --> 04:41.240]  cannabis event in Aspen, Colorado, hosted by the Grimey Gatsby and several of the industry
[04:41.240 --> 04:44.360]  leaders. I'll have a lot more information, but please check that out and support the
[04:44.360 --> 04:48.840]  Grimey Gatsby, CannabisGrandCrew.com. So we were going to talk about Joey Diaz before
[04:48.840 --> 04:52.400]  I got on this and really huge sidetrack, but anywhere we were, I knew where we were. I
[04:52.400 --> 04:56.480]  know what we're doing. I know what we're doing, dog. Just like Joey knows what he's doing,
[04:56.480 --> 05:03.280]  brother, man. So it was so good. So that was, I've seen a lot of comedians and, um, Anthony
[05:03.280 --> 05:08.680]  Jizzle Nick was one of my favorites, but every second of his act from the time he walks out
[05:08.680 --> 05:13.200]  to the time he says, thank you. Every second of that is calculated. Yeah. Um, I can see
[05:13.240 --> 05:18.080]  him counting between jokes. I can see his mouth going one, two, three, and he counts
[05:18.080 --> 05:23.760]  to 11 and then he tells another joke. Really? Yeah. But I, and so there's that style. You
[05:23.760 --> 05:27.280]  know what I mean? He comes out and that's like a, if that was a band, who would I compare
[05:27.280 --> 05:31.240]  that to? That's like rush. Every note is they know what they're doing tonight. Every single
[05:31.240 --> 05:36.240]  note all the way through jizzle Nick did that. Uh, Joey Diaz came out and kind of had an
[05:36.240 --> 05:42.640]  idea of what he was going to say and just leveled us just being himself. Most of that,
[05:42.640 --> 05:46.640]  he he's told those bits two or three times. One of the bits he told, I swear, I heard
[05:46.640 --> 05:52.520]  him make up on accident on the podcast just a few days before he flew to Colorado. Yeah.
[05:52.520 --> 05:56.060]  He's a fucking pro. And he took that like something like just right now we'd be saying
[05:56.060 --> 05:59.360]  something and he'd be like, Oh my God, dog, that's tremendous dog. I'm writing that shit
[05:59.360 --> 06:03.620]  down dog. And he can make 15 minutes out of it. Brought, yeah. Brought it to us in Denver
[06:03.620 --> 06:08.880]  several days later and ruined the club with it. My stomach and ribs and this part of my
[06:08.880 --> 06:13.000]  jaw right here was sore. I was laughing so hard. I had to tense up my back because it
[06:13.000 --> 06:17.240]  was hurting. I had to move my muscle tension somewhere else. You were sitting back like
[06:17.240 --> 06:22.840]  a little, I realized cause I was sitting forward on the edge of my seat the whole time. I loved
[06:22.840 --> 06:29.400]  it and, and we, I was just sitting forward and just excited. It was so fun. And, and
[06:29.400 --> 06:33.920]  just every word he was going to say was going to make me laugh. And Jeff said it, he goes,
[06:33.920 --> 06:38.160]  Clint, you were laughing harder than anybody else there. It was good because you appreciated
[06:38.160 --> 06:41.600]  the show. And we talked about being a good audience. Clint is a performer and we know
[06:41.600 --> 06:46.440]  what it's like. And I'm a musician. So I know what it's like to have a stale audience. And
[06:46.440 --> 06:50.400]  it wasn't us kissing his ass either. Joey was on fire. Fuck. Yeah, he was. Oh, that
[06:50.400 --> 06:54.880]  was the thing is, uh, so we, he does about maybe an hour, hour and 15 he somewhere in
[06:54.880 --> 07:01.220]  there and he, and he crushes, there was no point in there when I was bored or anything.
[07:01.220 --> 07:05.320]  And then afterwards we're like, Oh, can we meet him? You know, we're, we want to like
[07:05.320 --> 07:09.360]  get backstage. You know, I just want to say thank you. That's in spoiled you too. Well,
[07:09.360 --> 07:14.120]  I took a bunch of weed for Joey Diaz also. I ain't no chump. Yeah. We're going to keep
[07:14.120 --> 07:17.280]  for the door. We're going to try to give him a little bit of weed. And so then all of a
[07:17.280 --> 07:21.400]  sudden he, he talks to every single person that wants to talk to him. He came out to
[07:21.400 --> 07:25.280]  the hallway of the club and just hung out the only exit that you could take. And he's
[07:25.280 --> 07:28.160]  just standing there and you could shake his hand and get a picture. He took a picture
[07:28.160 --> 07:32.920]  with everybody, everybody, everybody. Uh, he asks you your name and then addresses you
[07:32.920 --> 07:36.800]  by name and the conversation. That's so cool. Yeah. Yeah. He remembers your name for that
[07:36.800 --> 07:40.720]  talk. He's, he's that kind of guy. If you listen to Diaz, you know, if he probably still
[07:40.720 --> 07:44.480]  remembers our names, if we see him again, he'd be like, Oh, fucking Clint, right? Clint,
[07:44.480 --> 07:48.880]  right? Dog. Cause he calls you dog. Every other word is dog and cock sucker. Just stand
[07:48.880 --> 07:53.240]  up and out of the crowd. Just a teeny bit on your own. Yeah. Like it helps that he's
[07:53.240 --> 07:57.540]  cool. But like you guys have an extra little leg up there. You're both memorable on site.
[07:57.540 --> 08:02.360]  We need to get some ski caps, bro. And be Opie and can Jack's for Halloween. I could
[08:02.420 --> 08:08.160]  do that, man. I look, I'm looking like Ope a little more every day. Every day. Yeah.
[08:08.160 --> 08:11.700]  That's a man beard over there, bro. Just got to get my wife killed somehow and then, uh,
[08:11.700 --> 08:16.640]  hook up with a prostitute and I'm set. I, uh, I'm just kind of awkward silence for a
[08:16.640 --> 08:22.000]  second. No, I get it. I get it. You sent out a tweet this week about your beard that just
[08:22.000 --> 08:27.080]  crushed me. It was the, like with a beard like this, you can't pee indoors. I spent
[08:27.080 --> 08:31.800]  about five minutes laughing at that. Like that's sort of true. Like, yeah. So you guys,
[08:31.800 --> 08:36.560]  if you find beard trees growing along the Pacific Northwest, Clint was plucking beard
[08:36.560 --> 08:39.960]  hairs out of his beard and throwing them out the window in hopes to plant little beard
[08:39.960 --> 08:43.120]  trees. I'm just trying to get back to the community guys. Let's know how, let us know
[08:43.120 --> 08:48.040]  how that worked. If you're in the PNW. Yeah. Um, but we hung out with Joey for probably
[08:48.040 --> 08:54.360]  an hour afterwards. So everybody hangs out, takes a picture. He taps me on the Joey Diaz,
[08:54.360 --> 08:57.840]  taps me on the shoulder and walks away and says, Ross the Jeff, you know, I love you.
[08:57.840 --> 09:01.680]  I'm a cocksucker. And I was like, Holy shit. He just called me a cocksucker. And Clint
[09:01.680 --> 09:04.920]  was smooth about it. He stuck out his hand and wanted that one final, like, this is my
[09:04.920 --> 09:09.520]  one-on-one. He goes, Hey, I'm a Stan. I'm an open mic comedian. And what you did, I
[09:09.520 --> 09:12.480]  think you told him something about what you did just changed my mic or something like
[09:12.480 --> 09:16.640]  that. Well, it just, it was real inspiring. Yeah. I think I told him and he goes, dog,
[09:16.640 --> 09:21.080]  you're an open micro dog. Come here, dog. And like, just took like seven steps away
[09:21.080 --> 09:25.040]  from where we were into this little, like kind of just off to the side and be an area
[09:25.040 --> 09:29.800]  and had a talk with Clint about open mic and standup comedy. And do you want to tell
[09:29.800 --> 09:32.960]  him, tell the world what they told, what he told you or you don't keep that to yourself?
[09:32.960 --> 09:38.400]  No, it was so cool. It was so cool just to have this like one-on-one with a legend in
[09:38.400 --> 09:42.320]  my mind, he's a legend. And I, you know, I don't get starstruck or stuff like that because
[09:42.320 --> 09:47.560]  he's a cool fucking guy. And he just, he was so personable, but he was just like, dog,
[09:47.560 --> 09:51.440]  you got to write an hour a day. That's all you got to do. Maybe for two weeks, you're
[09:51.440 --> 09:54.400]  not going to get nothing, but you just got to write and you've got to write and you've
[09:54.400 --> 09:58.200]  got to keep after it. You got to get on stage. And I, you know, and I was just sitting there
[09:58.200 --> 10:01.800]  just listening, you know, and that's because I'm not trying to tell him anything. I'm just
[10:01.800 --> 10:05.320]  Joey, this is awesome. And then, you know, and I wasn't, he was trying to get out of
[10:05.320 --> 10:08.840]  there too. So I was like, Hey, I appreciate it, man. We're going to let you get out of
[10:08.840 --> 10:14.040]  here. I hope you have a great time in Denver. And, uh, it was great. He didn't want to leave.
[10:14.040 --> 10:18.080]  He liked hanging out and just having a conversation. You know what I mean? He was like, I got to
[10:18.080 --> 10:21.760]  go dog. I don't want to, but you can see, you could see he was a little tired, but he
[10:21.760 --> 10:26.200]  was just like, God damn, I don't, I don't want to leave. He was a great guy. And, uh,
[10:26.200 --> 10:30.520]  so, uh, if this gets back to Joey Diaz, uh, thank you for the great show. Thanks for hanging
[10:30.520 --> 10:35.680]  out. Thanks for the advice. Um, we love you and, and you got, you gained a fan for life
[10:35.680 --> 10:40.800]  by just hanging out for that hour times too. Fuck. Yeah. Uh, and also do thanks for just
[10:40.800 --> 10:44.640]  taking a minute. Like you're a busy dude. We know you had to get to the hotel and smoke
[10:44.640 --> 10:49.520]  that blunt. They gave you fuck. Yeah. And those edibles that you got, so she was, yeah.
[10:49.520 --> 10:53.360]  So thanks for just hanging out. That's fucking cool. You took a minute and that means a lot.
[10:53.360 --> 10:57.560]  He's been in the longest yard. He's on Joe Rogan's podcast. He's got his own podcast.
[10:57.560 --> 11:02.000]  If you can take an ear bashing, if you've got some balls, listen to the church of what's
[11:02.000 --> 11:07.400]  happening now with Joey Coco Diaz and Lisa at it's not for Gentiles. Uh, he'll tell you
[11:07.400 --> 11:10.840]  to go fuck yourself on the first episode you listen. So be prepared. But if you can get
[11:10.840 --> 11:15.080]  past that, it's a great show. No, he's funny as shit. And then, and, and if you get a chance
[11:15.080 --> 11:19.920]  to see him live, there's, there's, if you miss out, you will be, you will regret it.
[11:19.920 --> 11:24.320]  If you have an adult diaper, wear one. I wanted to piss my pants. I was laughing so hard.
[11:24.320 --> 11:26.960]  The thing was, is I had to piss the whole time he was up there and I was like, I am
[11:26.960 --> 11:33.600]  not leaving for one moment. I will piss myself if I, I'm, I was so happy to be there and
[11:33.600 --> 11:37.120]  the tickets were reasonable. We saw him at the Denver improv, beautiful club, beautiful
[11:37.120 --> 11:41.240]  club. I'd love to go back there. We will be back there. Also, we made a new friend that
[11:41.240 --> 11:45.440]  night. His name's Abdullah. Abdullah, you just traveled to Mississippi and I hope you're
[11:45.440 --> 11:48.680]  doing well there, my friend. I hope everything worked out for you. Yeah, brother. Shout out,

[11:52.040 --> 11:55.960]  don't do that, but he actually downloaded the podcast while he was sitting next to us.
[11:55.960 --> 11:59.800]  So there's a good chance he's listening. Find me bro. What's up, bro? Hope everything worked
[11:59.800 --> 12:05.680]  out. All right. Um, I want to talk about the city council meeting for a minute, but first

[13:27.840 --> 13:30.160]  some hilarious shit to talk about from that meeting.
[13:31.160 --> 13:35.960]  There, there's a lot to talk about from that meeting. What part caught you was hilarious.
[13:35.960 --> 13:43.040]  Oh, the, so I go to every city council meeting, uh, for the most part, everybody there knows
[13:43.040 --> 13:47.680]  me. I'm used to the police chief and the fire chief and the city manager and the city attorney
[13:47.680 --> 13:53.040]  and the council members coming up and saying hi or waving or giving me two minutes to talk
[13:53.040 --> 14:00.720]  to him about whatever. Um, not everybody in our community is. And I was sort of early
[14:00.720 --> 14:05.560]  to the meeting. I had signed up to speak and from the seat I usually sit in, I can't see
[14:05.560 --> 14:12.800]  the doors that people walk in from, but I can see, uh, the city staff and the city council
[14:12.800 --> 14:17.280]  real well. And they're kind of milling around waiting for the meeting to start and their
[14:17.280 --> 14:23.600]  decorum all just, they freeze. Like when somebody, I don't know, runs through a room
[14:23.600 --> 14:28.160]  naked and the rest of the well-dressed people go, wait, did that just happen? And everybody
[14:28.160 --> 14:33.880]  freezes for a second. Everybody froze for a second. So I swivel my head and I see two
[14:33.880 --> 14:37.840]  and a quarter sets of dreadlocks walk in the door.
[14:37.840 --> 14:43.280]  Um, Jeff and uh, two supporters he brought to the meeting. I don't know if they want
[14:43.280 --> 14:46.720]  to be named. Oh yeah. They're supporters. Thanks for coming guys. Adam and Angela. Thank
[14:46.720 --> 14:49.760]  you guys a lot for joining me to the city council meeting. Your numbers made a difference.
[14:49.760 --> 14:52.800]  We'll talk about that in a minute. Thank you very much for coming. But yeah, as you guys
[14:52.800 --> 15:00.400]  walked in, everybody was sort of like, why is it city council? Two people were Jedi staring
[15:00.400 --> 15:05.880]  me dude. I could feel one guy's eyes cooking a hole through my shirt and reading my soul.
[15:05.880 --> 15:09.680]  Like I was like, hi. I like looked at him and nodded like, uh, I'm not sure why you're
[15:09.680 --> 15:14.760]  staring like this is weird. Am I translucent right now? Is he seeing a ghost? And so like
[15:14.800 --> 15:18.080]  people start speaking and I go, I look at them while they speak. Right. And then I get
[15:18.080 --> 15:21.160]  the creepy feeling again. And I looked to my left and that dude is like this at me.
[15:21.160 --> 15:26.120]  And for the listeners, it's an intense stare, but like this just intense and sort of angry
[15:26.120 --> 15:32.000]  flat faced. Yeah. And I had never met the man. I've never met the man. I know him enough
[15:32.000 --> 15:36.120]  to like say hi and shake his hand. But the, you know, the city manager could not stop
[15:36.120 --> 15:40.880]  staring at you. There's another guy who fits the exact description of rich white guys.
[15:41.000 --> 15:44.800]  Uh, like rich white councilman. He's who you'd think of. If I saw him, I'd go, yeah, city
[15:44.800 --> 15:49.040]  council guy, run some shit. Uh, Oh, the city attorney. Yeah. The city manager looked at
[15:49.040 --> 15:53.800]  him and goes, who's the guy in the hat. And I was, I saw him say it like he didn't care
[15:53.800 --> 15:57.920]  that I was watching him. It was kind of awkward. That was funny through the whole meeting.
[15:57.920 --> 16:03.120]  He kept staring at my little group of people. So in a city council meeting, they do, they
[16:03.120 --> 16:06.280]  have a little structure. They have their agenda meeting right at the beginning. And then they
[16:06.280 --> 16:13.160]  have like a little, they say the pledge of allegiance and they pray. And then, uh, they
[16:13.160 --> 16:17.240]  open up the floor and they say they do public comment. And then right after that, they say,
[16:17.240 --> 16:21.480]  thank you. Or they do city contributions or something. They called it, they call it public
[16:21.480 --> 16:25.200]  forum where anyone from the public can speak for five minutes. And then they have council
[16:25.200 --> 16:28.560]  commentary right after that, where any of the council members, there was a part right
[16:28.560 --> 16:31.840]  before that, where the lady goes, this is the part where we would normally say, thanks
[16:31.840 --> 16:36.240]  to the people that have contributed to the community. Last week we did 101. Luckily,
[16:36.240 --> 16:40.600]  there are none this week. My little group chuckled and I go, huh? No shout outs on the
[16:40.600 --> 16:45.880]  episode this week was what I said, because I thought that was funny. So like Mike said,
[16:45.880 --> 16:49.520]  after that, they let each council member speak. So the first council member speaks and he's
[16:49.520 --> 16:52.840]  like, so first off, I want to say thanks to this person and this person. And I chuckled
[16:52.840 --> 16:56.080]  a little bit. I was like, huh? And the next one is like, I want to say thanks to this
[16:56.080 --> 17:01.240]  person. So five people in a row go and they all basically did shout outs. And by the fourth
[17:01.240 --> 17:06.200]  one, I giggled, I giggled out loud. And the girl next to me, Angela giggled. And then
[17:06.200 --> 17:10.200]  Adam leaned over and giggled. And we were all just like church giggling. And Angela
[17:10.200 --> 17:14.640]  had the balls to say it. She goes, shout outs. And we just couldn't even handle ourselves
[17:14.640 --> 17:16.280]  anymore. It was so funny.
[17:16.280 --> 17:20.960]  Even Montoya wasn't at this meeting, but her little council commentary for most of the
[17:20.960 --> 17:28.040]  meetings is it's blander than any advertising you've ever heard. It's just, it's almost
[17:28.040 --> 17:32.160]  a bulletin board reading session for a bunch of random local events. I mean, her shout
[17:32.160 --> 17:36.720]  outs are always come to the Pinewood Derby or come down to the softball game next week,
[17:36.720 --> 17:41.080]  or we're doing an East side park cleanup, like super duper simple shout outs. It's kind
[17:41.080 --> 17:42.080]  of fun to watch every week.
[17:42.080 --> 17:45.480]  The city council does some shout outs, bro. There's like 20 minutes of solid, like, and
[17:45.480 --> 17:49.760]  big shout outs. And one, one person goes and also thanks to make it parks and rec and kept
[17:49.760 --> 17:53.640]  going. And I was like, oh, they just shouted out parks and rec. They did it like a real
[17:53.640 --> 17:57.640]  shout out. It was really fucking funny. So I thought that was hilarious. Hilarious.
[17:57.640 --> 18:02.400]  If you're there watching it's it's a play, like anything you would buy tickets to see.
[18:02.400 --> 18:06.280]  It's just about stuff. That's usually really boring. This may get me in trouble, but it's
[18:06.280 --> 18:11.800]  really funny. Um, I don't even know if I should say this. You have to address the president
[18:11.800 --> 18:18.840]  of city council as madam president. You don't have to, it's not required. The, the city
[18:18.840 --> 18:24.000]  staff do it out of respect. Like you call your very condescending tone. They, they,
[18:24.000 --> 18:30.240]  a couple of them were like, yes, fucking madam, fucking president was like what they
[18:30.240 --> 18:37.640]  should have said. They, uh, I owe a dollar. I owe $5 actually. It's more like God. I wasn't
[18:37.640 --> 18:41.280]  going to stop you earlier because you were on a roll. Somebody count them up guys. Somebody
[18:41.280 --> 18:45.760]  count them up. I'm going to pay that guy. I promise $35 per episode on this one. It's
[18:45.760 --> 18:49.640]  all right. I promised it. It's going to happen. I love it. It may have to, they have to come
[18:49.640 --> 18:53.560]  after nature's green remedies, get the refill, but it'll happen. Yeah. Well, there's been
[18:54.120 --> 19:00.520]  quite a bit of controversy and like, I don't know, friction, I suppose you'd call it between
[19:00.520 --> 19:04.520]  the city council and city staff and members of city council. A couple of months ago, the
[19:04.520 --> 19:08.560]  council commentary thing was like the polite as fuck. You know, book you that you have
[19:08.560 --> 19:14.160]  ever heard. Um, one of the city councilman was in the paper saying stuff, two or three
[19:14.160 --> 19:18.680]  of the other ones was doing was illegal. And he kept using the phrase shadow government
[19:18.680 --> 19:24.680]  and like, did they were ready? Like I seriously was waiting for him to rise up with ice picks.
[19:24.680 --> 19:30.080]  Like as soon as they cut the camera feed one night, the cameras are gone. Step, step, step.
[19:30.080 --> 19:33.160]  Oh, I was sitting in a seat where I could hear the whole production crew too. That was
[19:33.160 --> 19:37.800]  really a privilege being a nerd, like loving tech gear. I was loving it. Oh yeah. I could
[19:37.800 --> 19:40.760]  see all the sound equipment and I could hear the camera crew behind me. It was awesome.
[19:40.760 --> 19:44.920]  They're in that there's one door between me and them and you could hear them five, four,
[19:44.920 --> 19:51.120]  three, we're live. It was just neat watching it. Uh, yeah, I picked those seats for a reason.
[19:51.120 --> 19:55.760]  I posted a picture. I posted a picture on Instagram of myself. Uh, it was on the, I
[19:55.760 --> 19:59.680]  was on the news and someone's like, dude, you look paranoid. Actually that facial expression
[19:59.680 --> 20:06.520]  was when, uh, the city council president announced her resignation. That's the face I made. That's
[20:06.520 --> 20:10.440]  the moment that that picture was taken. I can't believe they used you and Angela is
[20:10.440 --> 20:15.200]  the reaction footage for that shot though. Like the whole room went, Oh, and they were
[20:15.200 --> 20:20.760]  like, Oh, get the dreadlocks. Get them on camera. The guy I work in the camera was one
[20:20.760 --> 20:24.680]  of my best friends from high school. Nice. Yeah. We played in a band together in 1998.
[20:24.680 --> 20:28.360]  So yeah, he knew me. He walked up and said, hello. It was really fun being in the council
[20:28.360 --> 20:33.840]  meeting and a newscaster in a suit walks up all, hi Jeff. Good to see you. I think it's
[20:33.840 --> 20:38.280]  the same newscaster that tried to get an interview with me after probably. Yeah. He talked to
[20:38.280 --> 20:41.080]  you for a minute during in there, but you were, you were kind of, you got shooken up,
[20:41.080 --> 20:44.440]  dude. You get a little nervous right before you speak. You go in tunnel vision mode. So
[20:44.440 --> 20:50.000]  much, but it's sorted by default. I am the guy that has to stand up and speak cause I've
[20:50.000 --> 20:54.760]  got the squeaky clean everything. You've got the college education, you got the good vocabulary.
[20:54.760 --> 20:58.040]  Uh, I've got the dreadlocks in the beard. They don't want to talk to me. They, they
[20:58.040 --> 21:00.600]  stared me down just sitting in council. If I would've walked up there, then while you
[21:00.600 --> 21:03.320]  got five minutes and they would've pulled out their phones and just started tweeting.
[21:03.320 --> 21:06.760]  Like, and if I had went up there, they'd have been like, ah, we're not going to let the
[21:06.760 --> 21:11.160]  guy with the felony. Come on. Exactly. And let, let the security stand up a little closer,
[21:11.160 --> 21:17.160]  please. Yeah. So city council meeting, uh, Mike went and spoke against the proposed ordinance
[21:17.160 --> 21:22.520]  that was coming up. Uh, we, uh, you want to tell us how that went so that I don't have
[21:22.520 --> 21:27.440]  to fumble through it. Fumble through it. Sure. Um, the proposed ordinance is still sitting
[21:27.440 --> 21:35.400]  at the planning zoning level. They are what's called a recommending body. Um, they suggest
[21:35.400 --> 21:42.520]  things to the city council and the city council can run with that idea or have them amend
[21:42.520 --> 21:48.280]  that idea in some way, or they can kill it all together. Um, usually city council tells
[21:48.280 --> 21:51.760]  planning and zoning like, Hey, we'd like to see this. And then they go work on that. It's
[21:51.760 --> 21:56.300]  my understanding that this is not that kind of ordinance. This is something planning and
[21:56.300 --> 22:02.080]  zoning has been working on as their own effort to sort of show city council as a way to solve
[22:02.080 --> 22:07.880]  some of the complaints they've been receiving. Um, essentially planning and zoning is fired
[22:07.880 --> 22:14.520]  up because people can see and smell pot. And, uh, that's bad as far as they're concerned.
[22:14.520 --> 22:18.520]  And they would like to come up with rules and regulations so that no one ever sees or
[22:18.520 --> 22:25.520]  smells pot. And if you're trying to grow your own marijuana or know someone that is, you
[22:25.520 --> 22:30.160]  can see how problematic that might become if you've got to get it all the way back out
[22:30.160 --> 22:35.160]  of sight and out of mind. And you can't do that in your own home. Um, the problems with
[22:35.160 --> 22:41.160]  this ordinance sort of spin out of control real rapidly. And, uh, we, as far as the community
[22:41.160 --> 22:46.640]  goes, I think don't like it on every, every part of it is bad. And, uh, so we tried to
[22:46.640 --> 22:50.280]  rally up people with the last episode and a couple of other things to get down to the
[22:50.280 --> 22:54.920]  meeting. And this time we had a pretty good show of support at the city council meeting
[22:54.920 --> 23:01.320]  on Tuesday night. Um, I spoke during public forum and sort of pleaded with them to think
[23:01.320 --> 23:05.320]  about how many people in the city they're affecting with these rules, how many people's
[23:05.320 --> 23:10.960]  rights under amendment 20 or a menu amendment 64 would be restricted by these rules. I mean,
[23:10.960 --> 23:15.560]  now all of a sudden you've got roommates trying to figure out who gets to exercise their constitutional
[23:15.560 --> 23:19.560]  rights and who doesn't, because you can only exercise so many of them at one time in a
[23:19.560 --> 23:24.900]  home with the plan. Mike showed up with statistics and counts. He told the city council how many
[23:24.900 --> 23:29.660]  patients there are in the city and County. He told them how many of them have a caregiver.
[23:29.660 --> 23:34.060]  He told them how much it costs to make a facility like they're required. Yeah. Uh, most of the
[23:34.060 --> 23:37.980]  people that spoke at city council, the city council kind of gave them the look of, yeah,
[23:37.980 --> 23:42.220]  we've heard this before and you're back again this week. Thanks. Gotcha. Uh, when Mike spoke,
[23:42.220 --> 23:45.900]  they all kind of sat up and they actually leaned forward and listened. I was paying
[23:45.900 --> 23:50.820]  more attention to their faces and just listened into Mike. It, uh, they like it when I speak
[23:50.820 --> 23:55.460]  a number of council members have told me like, thanks for having like some data to back up what
[23:55.460 --> 24:01.180]  you're saying or taking the time to read the entire article. They, they get a lot of rambling
[24:01.180 --> 24:05.900]  at them and like angry rambling and you know, you're fired up and you're passionate. I'm not,
[24:05.900 --> 24:11.300]  I'm not a big fan of public speaking. It makes me incredibly nervous. Honestly, I, we did our best
[24:11.300 --> 24:15.260]  to calm you down. You said I'm nervous as shit. And so we just started talking to him just random.
[24:15.260 --> 24:19.780]  I'm all sweaty and pasty. What do you think about bacon? Just to focus out of it. And uh,
[24:19.780 --> 24:25.020]  but somebody has got to do it. And I've been the one that's been biting that bullet lately. So I
[24:25.020 --> 24:29.940]  went down Tuesday night and said my piece. And honestly, like usually when people bring
[24:29.940 --> 24:35.140]  supporters down for their issue, like lately when the trash haulers speak, there's like five or 10
[24:35.140 --> 24:40.020]  trash haulers behind them that really take a minute to cheer and clap. Um, as soon as the,
[24:40.020 --> 24:45.660]  whoever's gotten up to speak is done speaking. And I half expected, what were there? Six or seven
[24:45.660 --> 24:51.660]  people behind us? Maybe eight. I'd say there's about eight of us, eight plus us. I wasn't sure
[24:51.660 --> 24:56.100]  how well I did when I get up and I start giving a speech. Honestly, I go into a weird little zone
[24:56.100 --> 25:02.420]  where I know what kind of what I'm saying and I'm prepared to say, you know, something specific.
[25:02.420 --> 25:08.340]  But once I get up and start talking, there isn't a filter between like brain Mike and mouth Mike,
[25:08.500 --> 25:13.060]  there's nobody being like, don't cuss or make sure you emphasize this. It's all the best. There's
[25:13.060 --> 25:16.660]  too much adrenaline. Did you realize what you said at the end? You stood up and you said,
[25:16.660 --> 25:23.620]  thank you for my time. And he walked away from him. I mean, that's the perfect example. Like
[25:23.620 --> 25:28.100]  my heart's pounding so fast and there's so much adrenaline. They knew what you meant. I know what
[25:28.100 --> 25:33.380]  you meant. You meant, Hey, you're welcome. Yeah. Essentially like that's what you're welcome. I
[25:33.380 --> 25:37.620]  know you don't have time to Google this, did it for you. So by, by coming out and showing support
[25:37.700 --> 25:42.260]  by you speaking, and there was another guy that went to another meeting who spoke about his family
[25:42.260 --> 25:47.540]  and how this was affecting them in such a traumatic way. Uh, do you, did you guys make a
[25:47.540 --> 25:52.900]  difference? Did we all make a difference? It's we've said it's been curved for a while. Um,
[25:52.900 --> 26:00.420]  okay guys. So Monday we had a city meeting or starting Monday or since Monday, we've had a
[26:00.420 --> 26:04.500]  city council meeting, a planning and zoning meeting and a County commissioner's meeting
[26:05.060 --> 26:09.620]  at each one of those three meetings, they were discussing rules that would take away your ability
[26:09.620 --> 26:14.420]  to grow in your own home, limit the amount of plants you're, you're growing to an arbitrary
[26:14.420 --> 26:18.660]  number that they just picked. They decided I, that ought to be enough. Good enough. We'll cap
[26:18.660 --> 26:25.460]  it at 12 in the city or 16 or 18 in the County. Um, and if you live up in Bula and have 400 acres
[26:26.100 --> 26:31.220]  and all of that's one property, you can only grow 18 plants there. It doesn't matter how many
[26:31.220 --> 26:34.900]  different residents are set up on your property and none of that. I mean, they're just really
[26:34.900 --> 26:39.780]  terrible rules. So the community kind of tried to rally. We did the podcast episode. There was
[26:39.780 --> 26:44.900]  another community meeting at the daily grind. There's another one tomorrow at four o'clock.
[26:44.900 --> 26:49.780]  If anyone wants to come on Friday, the 17th at four o'clock, this will go up till Monday morning.
[26:49.780 --> 26:54.660]  So nevermind. You guys are late. Sorry, guys. You guys didn't show up where you guys,
[26:54.660 --> 26:58.420]  Oh, we were waiting on you. I want you to go back in time. I'm all dabbed and started thinking this
[26:58.660 --> 27:03.620]  was live. We can put this out tomorrow if we wanted. Um, we just have to record another one
[27:03.620 --> 27:09.780]  for Sunday, but, uh, the progress we made to get everybody that could make it made it. Everybody
[27:09.780 --> 27:16.420]  that, um, felt like they wanted to speak, spoke. Um, I met the, the gentleman who was quoted in
[27:16.420 --> 27:21.620]  the chieftain who he's a young guy. He's a little younger than me. I'd say he's maybe 25. He's got
[27:21.620 --> 27:26.420]  a wife who's sick. He's got a mother-in-law who's sick and he's got a child with cancer
[27:26.980 --> 27:33.140]  and he's their caregiver. He has a job where he can't consume. So he's just taking care of them.
[27:33.140 --> 27:38.820]  And his testimony, I mean, it was like, I was throwing spit balls and he rolled up in a tank.
[27:38.820 --> 27:43.940]  Like they, they heard what I had to say at all three meetings and they appreciated me coming
[27:43.940 --> 27:48.820]  down and saying my piece. But when he got up and spoke, they hit the brakes hard.
[27:49.620 --> 27:54.580]  And I'll see you opened up for this guy. And he was the headliner. He was the headliner.
[27:55.140 --> 28:00.420]  Yes. So what's come of your guys' work? Did they stop it? Did they hesitate? Are they
[28:00.420 --> 28:07.420]  going to rework it? The County is they delayed the vote again to do more research. Um,
[28:09.700 --> 28:15.060]  I think for two weeks, maybe three, watch the County commissioner's website. They post their
[28:15.060 --> 28:20.340]  agendas on Fridays. Usually, um, their meetings are usually Tuesdays. So you get about five days
[28:20.340 --> 28:28.660]  to check it out and a heads up. Um, the city has the planning and zoning commission delayed
[28:28.660 --> 28:34.420]  presenting this plan to city council by two months. Nice. And they have given those that
[28:34.420 --> 28:39.300]  came to speak at the planning and zoning meeting a seat at the table while these rules get reworked.
[28:39.300 --> 28:43.460]  So a couple of us that came to speak against, and a couple of people that came to speak for,
[28:43.460 --> 28:46.820]  we'll be sitting at the table while these get redone. That's something I kind of wanted to
[28:46.820 --> 28:52.580]  ask you about is Hugh. You said at, at, when you address city council, you actually said, guys,
[28:52.580 --> 28:55.940]  please find somebody that knows what they're talking about. When you do this, you looked
[28:55.940 --> 28:58.740]  them straight in the face. You're like, you guys don't know anything about weed. Please find
[28:58.740 --> 29:03.780]  somebody that knows what they're talking about and put them on your committee. I almost considered
[29:03.780 --> 29:09.620]  volunteering or asking you how I get to be a part of that because I am a legal grower and I'm a
[29:09.620 --> 29:15.220]  caregiver. I'm not a black market guy. I think I can set a good example. It's more than once I've
[29:15.220 --> 29:19.620]  fantasized about being able to like kidnap and hood a member of city government and like sneak
[29:19.620 --> 29:23.220]  them through your backyard and be like, this is what it looks like when it's done. Right.
[29:23.220 --> 29:27.540]  This is what legal looks like. This is what following the rules looks like. Yeah. Because
[29:27.540 --> 29:32.420]  unless you've blown your house up or you've set your garage on fire or overloaded a transformer
[29:32.420 --> 29:37.140]  behind your house, they've never come to your home. That was Mike's main point to city council.
[29:37.140 --> 29:40.980]  He said, the guys you're messing with are the, not the medical caregivers. Those are commercial
[29:40.980 --> 29:45.540]  growers that are making a weed crop. You're making those rules to enforce upon medical
[29:45.540 --> 29:50.020]  caregivers and you're totally missing the point. And I think they caught on. I think we've got
[29:50.020 --> 29:54.100]  more time to deal with it. So dude, get on that committee, work it out, let them know.
[29:55.380 --> 29:58.740]  There's a handful of us that are scrambling. If you're listening to this show, when you are
[29:58.740 --> 30:05.300]  interested in cannabis advocacy, you can find me on Twitter, Nemo punk 15, just like it sounds
[30:05.380 --> 30:11.380]  any MOP one K one five, or, um, I just created a Facebook page. It was something to somebody else
[30:11.380 --> 30:15.540]  at one of the meetings brought up. It'd be great if we had a Facebook page where we could kind of
[30:15.540 --> 30:20.740]  kick out community activism info and organize people for when the meetings are, because all
[30:20.740 --> 30:26.740]  of that can be very confusing. And I know we're in an anti-Facebook mood, but, uh, I'm feel kind
[30:26.740 --> 30:30.100]  of bad because I spaced the name of the freaking face, but you can't remember your own Facebook
[30:30.100 --> 30:35.140]  page. I'm pretty sure it's sensible cannabis laws or cannabis regulation. I remember how I
[30:36.100 --> 30:39.940]  I saw it the other night. I'm pretty sure that I don't have a dad, but there's one in arms reach.
[30:39.940 --> 30:43.940]  So pull it up right now. Memories are further than they should be. Let me, let me cut you off. I know
[30:43.940 --> 30:48.260]  that, uh, for the listeners, this might sound like if you're out of state or if you're out of Pueblo,
[30:48.260 --> 30:52.820]  like this is not like your, you're like, Oh man, these guys are just talking about hometown stuff.
[30:52.820 --> 30:55.620]  You guys got to watch those city councilmen wherever you're at.
[30:56.500 --> 31:03.140]  I local politics is interesting because it's the stuff that most affects you. So you should be kind
[31:03.140 --> 31:07.780]  of keeping an eye on your local council anyway. And B if you're trying to legalize marijuana on
[31:07.780 --> 31:13.780]  any level, getting the people that are elected right above you is the place to start. Yeah.
[31:13.780 --> 31:16.900]  So that, that was more of what I wanted to say. I know that there was probably some people like,
[31:18.020 --> 31:24.980]  cause I know I was, no, I just wanted to say, I know I didn't you see me? I kept rambling.
[31:27.460 --> 31:30.020]  I throttle you a little bit, try to get it going. A little throttle.
[31:30.660 --> 31:38.340]  So Mike mentioned we're in an F Facebook mode. Um, I'm I read genetics. I had, I had 5,000,
[31:39.460 --> 31:43.940]  5,000 Facebook friends and I had close to seven to 10,000. I didn't pay attention to the number.
[31:43.940 --> 31:48.740]  There are about seven to 10,000 followers and Facebook decided to close my damn page.
[31:50.340 --> 31:54.660]  Facebook, eat it. Facebook. God damn it. I haven't. That was Clint over there with the F's. So charge
[31:54.660 --> 31:58.580]  him the five. Not me, please. Don't know. Just don't confuse the voices.
[31:58.660 --> 32:05.700]  But Facebook dude, come on bro. Eat a dick. Why'd you do that to me? Come on, come on. So I'm not
[32:05.700 --> 32:09.460]  on Facebook as much as I used to be. I was just going to go look for Mike's Facebook page and
[32:09.460 --> 32:12.980]  then I log into Facebook and all I can do is look at shit that people that have liked my shit. I
[32:12.980 --> 32:17.460]  can't really go comment. I can't like, I can't post. Oh, cause I can post, but yeah. Yeah. But I
[32:17.460 --> 32:21.620]  can't let go comment. I can't troll and have to find it. Being on Facebook is being a troll and
[32:21.620 --> 32:25.540]  you can't go troll people anymore. So you won't see me on Facebook, but check me out.
[32:25.780 --> 32:29.220]  You won't see me on Facebook, but check me out. Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws is the page
[32:29.220 --> 32:33.620]  that I created. Check it out on Facebook. We're rocking out at like eight likes right now. We're
[32:33.620 --> 32:38.900]  happy about that. Um, yeah, you'll get there. It takes a minute. I'm not on there yet. I figure
[32:38.900 --> 32:43.300]  it'll be about a year or two before it starts really rolling. And as soon as it does, they'll
[32:43.300 --> 32:49.620]  take it away. Don't give them the password. Fuck them. If you are on Facebook though, check out
[32:49.620 --> 32:55.380]  Wild Cousins. Wild Cousins is my comedy crew. We do comedy in Pueblo and Southern Colorado.

[33:00.260 --> 33:06.180]  You've got damn straight. I'm the only white one. So I just have to do it to myself. It's
[33:06.180 --> 33:11.380]  definitely a Pueblo show. Speaking of Pueblo, this podcast is brought to you by Hygro Indoor

[34:27.220 --> 34:30.660]  him, please. Thanks a lot, Ryan. All right. That's enough commercials. Uh, I like doing
[34:30.660 --> 34:35.460]  the commercials in the middle. You don't like overload them at the start. I think like listeners
[34:35.460 --> 34:39.860]  should read, like if you listen to a lot of podcasts, like I do, I like that you break it up.
[34:39.860 --> 34:42.500]  And it's like, you know what? We're going to talk for a little bit. We're going to get off that
[34:42.500 --> 34:46.900]  subject. Here's some more commercials. It's like a watching TV or something. I learned to do them
[34:46.900 --> 34:51.780]  at the beginning, like Rogan does. Yeah. Because, uh, if I prefer you don't, but if you want to,
[34:51.780 --> 34:55.460]  you can just skip right through them. If you just go about two minutes in, you're right past all the
[34:55.460 --> 35:01.700]  commercials. Five minutes, unless he gets on an on it. Fucking, uh, so if you look on my table,
[35:02.260 --> 35:06.500]  I've not been paid for this yet, but there may be in the future. I ordered nature box.
[35:07.540 --> 35:10.980]  Dude, I approve of nature box. They do not sponsor the show in any way yet.
[35:11.380 --> 35:16.660]  Uh, but that shit's awesome. It tastes good. It's good serving sizes. Uh, I've been replacing
[35:16.660 --> 35:21.060]  my sugary desires with something from nature box and I feel better, man. My teeth aren't going to
[35:21.060 --> 35:25.460]  rot away as quickly. My guts aren't going to die. I'm not going to get diabetes and that shit is
[35:25.460 --> 35:30.020]  good. It's tasty. I wouldn't go to the store and buy that because at the store, this town,
[35:30.020 --> 35:33.700]  it's not like a paid commercial dude, but this is the truth at the store. There's chocolate covered,
[35:33.700 --> 35:39.140]  this chocolate covered that there's crispy, this there's, and all man. So you just, I went to
[35:39.140 --> 35:44.020]  chocolatey one. I want all of them. But then when nature box sends you a box of like there was
[35:44.020 --> 35:49.300]  tomato basil covered almonds in there. I'm kind of into that. Well, let's crack one open. All right.
[35:50.500 --> 35:55.140]  Listeners don't go there yet because we're going to get you a promo code on the next episode. Yeah,
[35:55.140 --> 36:00.340]  because this is our, uh, yeah, this is our promo for the commercial for nature. I really am not
[36:00.340 --> 36:03.380]  sponsored by these guys, but it's such a good idea. I'm all about taking care of myself. Yeah.
[36:03.380 --> 36:07.300]  I go for it. I just reached in and grabbed a random delicious. This one is called coconut
[36:07.300 --> 36:13.620]  cashews. Oh, yeah. We'll all have a couple of coconut cashews. Let's eat on a podcast like for
[36:13.620 --> 36:19.140]  Joey Diaz or something. I'm not already superior. I'm not going to mouth. Fuck the fucking microphone.
[36:19.140 --> 36:22.500]  Did you hear? He got a comment from a listener that said, I'm not going to see you tonight
[36:22.500 --> 36:31.620]  because you chew on Mike. Oh, that was on Diaz's podcast. All right. Thank you, brother. Nice. Yeah.
[36:31.620 --> 36:36.020]  This should sound great on a podcast. And, uh, while I take a couple of mom and a right before
[36:36.020 --> 36:40.500]  I'm going to ask Clint, Clint came to the show because he wants to talk about not professional
[36:40.500 --> 36:44.980]  grade weed. He had some questions. He's like, I'm not a pro and your weed kills me. Dude,
[36:44.980 --> 36:50.980]  I'm seriously like, I'll take one hit of a bowl and that's good for me. Like I'm done. Like even
[36:50.980 --> 36:57.300]  right now I took one. You guys saw how minimal I took of that one and it's fucking me up. That's
[36:57.300 --> 37:01.540]  why I got all quiet when you were talking, you know, I'm just going to, I'm level with you.
[37:01.540 --> 37:05.860]  Cause I'm, it's just, it's too strong, too fast. I've only been smoking for two months.
[37:06.500 --> 37:11.060]  You don't need rocket fuel yet. No, I need fucking, uh, give me that unleaded shit that,
[37:12.020 --> 37:19.620]  that 309 fucking number 85 fucking the 85 octane and not the turbo boost. Yeah. Please do not put
[37:19.620 --> 37:25.620]  nitrous in my fucking, so you don't want to take a half gram dad. No, I'm not touching dabs. I love
[37:25.620 --> 37:33.380]  you guys, but you can go shop it brother. You can put that hot meal in your ass boy. I don't
[37:33.380 --> 37:39.780]  want to touch it. It's scary. But the thing is, is I'm getting like a huge high off of one hit.
[37:39.780 --> 37:46.420]  And that's, and I know we've said this since before I was smoking, we said, start slow. Now,
[37:46.420 --> 37:50.660]  if I think here in a couple of minutes, like it, it didn't hit me well enough. I might take another
[37:50.660 --> 37:56.420]  one. I'm not doing that today. I got to work tonight, but that's the thing is I need to know,
[37:56.420 --> 38:02.420]  how do I get my hand some on some like mediocre weed unless I'm growing or finding it in the ditch
[38:02.420 --> 38:11.780]  somewhere. My smart ass answer is just go to the dispensary. Just look at all their jars and pick
[38:11.780 --> 38:20.020]  the one that smells like Kate. Or maybe you need something more high in CBD, but also, but less THC
[38:20.020 --> 38:26.340]  would be beneficial for you. You're not alone here. There are a ton of people that have either
[38:26.340 --> 38:31.380]  avoided marijuana because of the legalities or, you know, for whatever reason, and are now walking
[38:31.380 --> 38:38.100]  into a dispensary going, Hmm. And yeah, they've a rookie cookie is the product name that sticks
[38:38.100 --> 38:41.460]  in my mind. There was an article about it. The Denver post not too long ago. Is that an actual
[38:41.460 --> 38:45.860]  Colorado product? I'm pretty sure that is a product that's sitting on Colorado dispensaries.
[38:46.020 --> 38:50.980]  That's awesome. It's just a spectacular name. The rookie cookie. If I walked in as a 55 year
[38:50.980 --> 38:56.260]  old dude into a dispensary and hadn't really consumed cannabis ever. And I saw rookie cookies,
[38:56.260 --> 39:02.740]  I would like clap and laugh. Some of those, please. That's me. Do you have rookie weed too?
[39:02.740 --> 39:07.060]  And I, they've starting to stock it in a number of dispensaries from what I understand that demand
[39:07.060 --> 39:12.500]  is huge for, they want regular weed, not back in the day. Amazing. We're going to be 21 to smoke
[39:12.500 --> 39:16.500]  weed. You get all these kids turning 21 and they're like, well, it's legal now I can go do it.
[39:16.500 --> 39:21.540]  I can go out to the bar. I can join the military. I can go smoke some pot and that's fine. But it's
[39:21.540 --> 39:26.580]  just, I don't want kids starting like with, with some goddamn Bruce banner that'll fucking knock
[39:26.580 --> 39:32.340]  down my ass or that Bubba Kush that that'll, that'll kick my ass. Yeah. That'll set you down
[39:32.340 --> 39:37.700]  for a minute. Yeah. And it's like four hours. I can't do anything. Like, I'm just like, all right,
[39:37.700 --> 39:41.940]  I'm going to, I guess I'm going through the cosmos right now. My mom used to smoke occasionally,
[39:41.940 --> 39:46.020]  not to bust my mom out, but back in the day, my mom's fucking hippie dude. She's smoked weed back
[39:46.020 --> 39:50.340]  in the day and she slowly quit and she hasn't smoked for years now that she's got a good job
[39:50.340 --> 39:53.940]  and shit. But I joke with her every occasionally, you know, like you want to smoke joint mom?
[39:53.940 --> 39:57.860]  And she's like, I would, but your, your weeds too damn strong. Now she's like the last time I
[39:57.860 --> 40:02.660]  smoked with you guys, it was just hell. She used to love it. She was a pothead dude. She used to
[40:02.660 --> 40:06.420]  wake and bake. Like I remember when I was little, her and my uncles would hang out and smoke joints
[40:06.420 --> 40:10.580]  all day long. And now she's like, Nope, that weed gets me too high. And my uncles are the same way
[40:10.660 --> 40:13.940]  too. They used to be, that's where I learned my shit was from my uncles that were pie heads and
[40:13.940 --> 40:18.900]  party animals. And now, now they're like, dude, you're crazy. That weed's too good. Like it's too
[40:18.900 --> 40:23.220]  good. That's kind of funny. Yeah. Well, and then you're going to get those guys that used to smoke
[40:23.220 --> 40:27.700]  eight joints and not get high back in the seventies because it was dirt weed. And then they come in
[40:27.700 --> 40:31.700]  and they're like, well, shit, I can smoke a whole joint. Why would I even be worried about it?
[40:31.700 --> 40:35.540]  And it's been 20 years. So they have zero tolerance. And all of a sudden they're thinking,
[40:35.540 --> 40:38.020]  Oh, this is going to be the same thing as that fucking dirt weed.
[40:38.660 --> 40:42.500]  If they go home and roll a joint and take five hits and get halfway through it. And
[40:43.140 --> 40:48.500]  yeah, by then it's too far. The Colorado rules, the laws say that they're supposed to have every
[40:48.500 --> 40:53.700]  product tested, even the buds. So they should have a THC level printed on the jars. We're not
[40:53.700 --> 40:56.900]  there yet. A lot of the shops aren't complying. They just can't afford it. And there's not enough
[40:56.900 --> 41:02.100]  testing facilities. Yeah. Right. Once we get to that point, you need something like closer to 10.
[41:02.100 --> 41:07.700]  What you've been smoking is in the 20 range. 20%. Yeah. I've grown herb that's tested in the
[41:07.700 --> 41:14.580]  27. Spence actually hit 29. Did he grow that? He grew that. Yeah. From those Rhian's Rhino from
[41:14.580 --> 41:18.820]  seed that Spence grew. Shout out to the fucking Spence. Yeah. Also shout out to steep Hill
[41:18.820 --> 41:23.460]  Haylent labs are the ones that test our stuff. That was, yeah, they did a good job. But, but
[41:23.460 --> 41:27.380]  that's what I'm getting at is like, there's just like, I don't know. You know, I guess that was
[41:27.380 --> 41:33.140]  more of my question was like, is there a strain that you would recommend to a newbie? No, no.
[41:33.700 --> 41:39.060]  Flow. Oh, flow. FLO. Yeah. Sorry. No, it's cool. I threw it out real quick. It just happens to be
[41:39.060 --> 41:44.820]  the one that I reused to grow. I got the flow around this. She's still around. Yeah. It's a,
[41:44.820 --> 41:48.900]  it's a perfect high. It's a nice, it's like a 50, 50 hybrid. The cut that I have is I feel like it's
[41:48.900 --> 41:54.260]  a 50, 50 hybrid. It's not too overpowering. It's got a good body high. It's got a good head high,
[41:54.260 --> 41:58.580]  but for me, it doesn't hit me hard enough. I almost got rid of it. But a lot of my friends
[41:58.580 --> 42:03.220]  are like, dude, you got to grow the flow. So it's still here. Flows. What I liked for days for a
[42:03.220 --> 42:08.260]  long time when you've got a whole bunch of stuff to do, but can't be in pain all day. I'd roll up
[42:08.260 --> 42:13.780]  a little flow for the morning and I'd be good all day. And it wasn't near as powerful as what I
[42:13.780 --> 42:19.140]  wanted for evenings, but maybe like some jelly bean, jelly bean might be good for you. Yeah.
[42:19.140 --> 42:23.060]  Just something to maintain, you know, like I'm not trying to get all fucking blasted and go take a
[42:23.060 --> 42:30.980]  nap. Like I got to do the laundry, you know, like speaking of laundry, these cashews was that
[42:30.980 --> 42:36.500]  almonds or cashews? They're coconut cashews. Those are really good. Those are delicious. Nature box
[42:36.500 --> 42:41.060]  all day. That's what I set them down because I wanted to have one at a time because I was,
[42:41.060 --> 42:45.700]  cause I loved it so much. And now I'm a guy who has listened to Rogan's podcast and everybody's
[42:45.700 --> 42:50.500]  podcast that says, Oh, go get nature's box. This converted me right now. It did. I'm going to go
[42:50.500 --> 42:55.620]  home. And, and, uh, if I can remember and not be high, I'm going to fucking order me. So you'll
[42:55.620 --> 42:59.540]  get the munchies and you'd be like, Oh, I should order nature box. Oh, what was the name of that
[42:59.540 --> 43:04.020]  thing that we were talking about? Why doesn't that episode come out already? But that's what
[43:04.020 --> 43:09.140]  happened to me. Uh, I hear Rogan and Diaz talk about it all the time. Uh, and I think Nerdist
[43:09.140 --> 43:13.060]  even promotes nature box. And so they did a free thing. They're like, if you order now, it's free.
[43:13.060 --> 43:16.580]  You get a free box. I didn't pay anything for this box of munchies that were eaten. They came
[43:16.580 --> 43:20.980]  straight to the door. But now every month I'm going to get a box for 1995. I think it's like
[43:20.980 --> 43:26.580]  proactive, but I think it's worth what I would go pay. Nature's box. Like they used to sling
[43:26.580 --> 43:31.540]  crag. Yep. Yep. It's like the Columbia house of snacks. First one's free. I just wanted everybody
[43:31.540 --> 43:35.460]  to know we all, we were all going to stop for a second and eat. And then it was just like, no,
[43:35.460 --> 43:39.780]  dude, this, yeah, it's pretty delicious shit. I approve nature box. Hey, uh, nature box. If
[43:39.780 --> 43:43.220]  you're listening, contact me for a sponsorship because I support your product and it would work
[43:43.220 --> 43:47.540]  well. Did you hear that awesome ad we just did? Yeah. We actually just pumped you up a lot. All
[43:47.540 --> 43:51.140]  right. We've been recording for a long time and Mike has some news. I know we're going to put Mike
[43:51.140 --> 44:01.860]  on again. Uh, popular demand. We'll try to keep everybody awake while he talks. Um, so save me a
[44:01.860 --> 44:06.100]  couple of minutes to read a couple of listener comments, but tell us about the new cannabis news
[44:06.100 --> 44:10.500]  that you were telling me about when he first showed up to the house, the local, uh, profits
[44:10.580 --> 44:16.980]  and such. Oh, the, the local Pueblo city budget came out this week and the city seems to think
[44:16.980 --> 44:22.500]  they're going to get 500,000 worth of marijuana taxes just for the next year. Yeah. For the,
[44:22.500 --> 44:27.620]  the actual city of Pueblo, but wait for the punchline. The punchline to that is, is the,
[44:27.620 --> 44:34.420]  the number that they're going to get next year is zero, not 500,000. And it's zero instead of 500,000
[44:34.420 --> 44:38.500]  because we don't have any marijuana businesses. You actually have to actually have to have a
[44:38.500 --> 44:45.860]  marijuana business located in your city to enjoy taxes from those businesses. And the Pueblo County
[44:45.860 --> 44:51.940]  has already made about 500 grand this year between the rec shops and the medical shops,
[44:51.940 --> 44:56.580]  the local tax and the little kickback that the state sends on the statewide tax.
[44:56.580 --> 45:01.060]  Now I've looked most of city council in the face recently. They seem like an intelligent group of
[45:01.060 --> 45:05.460]  people. Where are they predicting this money comes from? If we're not allowed to have a dispensary,
[45:05.460 --> 45:09.940]  the, the city manager puts that budget together and hands it to city council. That's part of the
[45:09.940 --> 45:15.140]  meeting we saw the other night. And so they're probably looking at it, thinking the same thing.
[45:15.140 --> 45:18.580]  Everyone in Pueblo that read the chieftain today. And the three of us are thinking is,
[45:19.140 --> 45:24.500]  well, if it's really zero, cause we don't have any marijuana businesses, where's this 500,000
[45:24.500 --> 45:29.300]  number. Well, I heard him. The irony in that is I honestly, I rarely go to city council meetings
[45:29.300 --> 45:34.020]  and I will now, um, I'm an anxious person and I felt intimidated to go. I've broken the ice and
[45:34.020 --> 45:38.100]  I'm not afraid anymore. You'll see me there more often. Thank you. Um, I don't know what I was
[45:38.100 --> 45:41.620]  going to say. It reminded me where I was headed with that. Oh, right at the beginning. One of
[45:41.620 --> 45:47.220]  their first things was, and we're proud to announce it last week where our budget was like $484,000
[45:47.220 --> 45:51.220]  or a million dollars short, but we've presented to you a balanced budget this week. And that's
[45:51.220 --> 45:55.540]  one of the things we fixed in our work sessions, but they didn't really present a balanced budget.
[45:55.540 --> 46:00.180]  Now that they just revealed their secret, they added in $500,000 that they're not going to get.
[46:00.180 --> 46:06.020]  They made it up. What I'm a little worried about is if that 500 grand pot number was in there
[46:06.020 --> 46:10.820]  before they carved out the three and a half million or whatever that they carved out over the last
[46:10.820 --> 46:15.620]  week, they might've been 4 million short and they only filled the hole three and a half million
[46:15.620 --> 46:19.140]  worth because they're pretending there's another half million that's going to come out. I don't
[46:19.140 --> 46:24.420]  know. Weed man's ass. I don't know that you have to have a pot store. If they would let a couple
[46:24.420 --> 46:29.380]  of dispensaries build within city limits, the licensing alone is 300 or I think it's like
[46:29.380 --> 46:35.700]  $3,000 for one. Each license, you have to have several, depending on what you're doing is five
[46:35.700 --> 46:42.100]  grand to the city and the state. So it's essentially 10 grand to do just to grow 10 grand to do the
[46:42.100 --> 46:47.780]  store, 10 grand to do the hash making. So if they open five shops, they make 25 G's right away.
[46:47.780 --> 46:53.220]  Minimum. The city's already taking in about five shops would be 50 G's. Oh, you mean,
[46:53.220 --> 46:58.260]  I see what you're saying. But the problem with that though is, is what they're worried about
[46:58.260 --> 47:02.980]  is that you can't just allow one cause that's a monopoly and you can't just allow five cause
[47:02.980 --> 47:07.780]  that's still a monopoly. In my opinion, you can't say, oh, you got here too late. You're not allowed
[47:07.780 --> 47:11.940]  to start. That's not the American way. This town doesn't really need more than, and this
[47:11.940 --> 47:15.860]  sounds ridiculous coming from me, but if a shop did it right, three or four shops would be more
[47:15.860 --> 47:20.020]  than enough for this city. I agree. But that's, that's on the businesses to decide later. Like,
[47:20.020 --> 47:24.820]  oh, you know, I don't think we can make money by starting one. So yeah, we're going to get
[47:24.820 --> 47:29.940]  influx of five and then all of a sudden it's going to be like, wow, we're, we're, we're all
[47:29.940 --> 47:34.740]  not doing great, but this guy's not doing well at all. And then he closes down and it's, we're
[47:34.740 --> 47:38.420]  going to see that one of these days we're going to see the first pot shop closed down. We're going
[47:38.420 --> 47:42.420]  to be like, that's weird. Like if a liquor store goes out, we're like, oh, we get it because there's
[47:42.420 --> 47:48.580]  a liquor store on every, every corner. Excuse me. You could do it, bro. I know I can't.
[47:48.580 --> 47:51.780]  Single-handedly cleaning up the airwaves. There we go.
[47:51.780 --> 47:56.260]  No, but what I'm saying is like, we see a liquor store on every, and there's a bar on every other
[47:56.260 --> 48:01.140]  one. So we see all these liquor stores and a liquor store goes out. We're like, oh yeah,
[48:01.140 --> 48:05.620]  of course it did. There's super competition. That's what's gonna happen with weed. And so
[48:05.620 --> 48:08.340]  prices are going to have to start dropping and that's better for everybody.
[48:09.380 --> 48:15.060]  That's in Washington right now, you're looking at $60 and change for a gram of legal marijuana.
[48:15.060 --> 48:19.300]  What? Yeah. The, the look you two just gave me is the look that you should have given me. Cause
[48:19.300 --> 48:24.660]  it's nuts. But if you're paying $60 for a gram of marijuana, you need to slap yourself in the face
[48:24.660 --> 48:29.380]  with your own penis. You need to listen to a good podcast that teaches you how to grow and
[48:29.380 --> 48:33.860]  provide your own cannabis. And then you need to go to naturesgreenremedies.com and use coupon code
[48:33.860 --> 48:38.820]  helping hands and order yourself some freaking high grade seeds. I recommend I read genetics,
[48:38.820 --> 48:44.340]  gauge green genetics, or maybe some alpha chronic. We actually watched what you're talking about
[48:45.300 --> 48:49.780]  with pod stores closing and the price dropping with medical over the last decade. And then when
[48:49.780 --> 48:56.580]  January 1st that the whole clock reset, they just wound it back to 2004 pods back to four 50.
[48:56.580 --> 49:00.340]  So it's this place that's got $60 grams. Is that because of a supply and demand thing?
[49:00.340 --> 49:06.900]  Yeah. That's the, all of the shops in Washington, there's a very few shops that are open. Their
[49:06.900 --> 49:12.180]  supply is extremely limited. They didn't have the time to bring in the crops before this all went
[49:12.180 --> 49:17.220]  live. Like with the licensing, you weren't allowed to grow for very long before shops were
[49:17.220 --> 49:23.940]  allowed to open. So they just haven't had any time in a year or two when shop numbers have risen
[49:23.940 --> 49:29.220]  significantly, production numbers have had a time to come in. All of that will change a bit, but
[49:29.940 --> 49:34.340]  it's going to be a year or two before you can buy a reasonable gram legally in Washington.
[49:34.340 --> 49:38.260]  Seattle has no idea what's coming to them. I know a little secret right now, Seattle.
[49:38.260 --> 49:40.420]  You suck you sons of bitches.
[49:40.420 --> 49:42.100]  You got some good shit coming
[49:42.100 --> 49:45.700]  Oh, they deserve it. I'm excited and I'm proud for Seattle and for what's happening. That's going
[49:45.700 --> 49:49.860]  to be a great thing. I'm super excited for who we're talking about. I'm really disappointed that
[49:49.860 --> 49:52.820]  it's happening. We'll make the announcement closer to the start of the year. Guys, we've got some
[49:52.820 --> 49:56.260]  cool news for you. There's a lot of cool stuff coming up. That's not really our announcement to
[49:56.260 --> 50:01.940]  make. So yeah, we'll have, we'll have those people on the show. It'll be dope. Dope. So Mike, you got
[50:01.940 --> 50:05.700]  your news out, Clint. You got to ask about, well, we didn't, you just got to find some shitty weed,
[50:05.700 --> 50:09.940]  I guess, dude. You got to go to, man, we figured it out. Go to a dispensary. I tried to bring you
[50:09.940 --> 50:14.260]  some. You brought me some good weed. I'm afraid. See, that's the thing is I'm always constantly
[50:14.260 --> 50:19.460]  afraid of like whatever I get to. So, so is this going to kill me? Like, is this the one that sends
[50:19.460 --> 50:24.740]  me into like a panic or something like that? Like, unfortunately so far, you know, I've gotten
[50:24.740 --> 50:30.420]  really fucking high and it hasn't like, I haven't had like this huge bad trip or anything like that.
[50:30.420 --> 50:31.780]  Then you're probably not going to.
[50:31.780 --> 50:35.940]  No, that's the thing is I can talk myself out of them because I know I'm on drugs right now.
[50:35.940 --> 50:37.140]  I understand it's not.
[50:37.140 --> 50:40.260]  Well, yeah, no, but I mean, as high as you're getting, it probably feels that way.
[50:40.820 --> 50:41.300]  That's good.
[50:41.300 --> 50:45.060]  You need, you need to be able to remind yourself that cannabis can't kill humans.
[50:45.060 --> 50:46.100]  No, that's fine. It's not.
[50:46.100 --> 50:47.300]  It's been my mantra.
[50:47.300 --> 50:49.860]  When you're too high now you're just killing cancer.
[50:49.860 --> 50:52.740]  Yeah. Fuck yeah. I ain't got cancer for shit.
[50:52.740 --> 50:56.100]  You're too high. Your cancer is too high. Also, it's just going backwards going,
[50:56.100 --> 51:00.100]  I don't know what to do. I'm not cancer anymore. And it just starts dying. I'm making all of that up.
[51:02.500 --> 51:04.020]  Jeff is not a doctor.
[51:04.100 --> 51:08.580]  Surprisingly, you wouldn't, you would never get out as a medical opinion.
[51:09.220 --> 51:13.860]  So Clint is talking about getting too wrecked off of like a bowl of too good a weed. And last night
[51:13.860 --> 51:19.700]  I did a gram dab and I honestly have not been that high since I did a half gram dab recently,
[51:21.860 --> 51:25.700]  but it took me, no, you remember on the show when I ate that 350 milligram edible,
[51:25.700 --> 51:29.220]  yeah, I was nearly, I was equally high, but in a different way.
[51:30.020 --> 51:35.860]  I was like red eyed and stoned. I was Chinese last night after that gram dab. When I ate that
[51:35.860 --> 51:40.900]  edible, I was, I felt like I was on energy drugs. I was jumping around and giddy. I couldn't jump
[51:40.900 --> 51:45.140]  around. There was no giddy last night. Shout out to giddy up since I keep saying giddy,
[51:45.140 --> 51:48.660]  what up giddy up 710. I bumped into him on chat roulette and it was really funny.
[51:50.420 --> 51:51.860]  He had his pants on. It was cool.
[51:51.860 --> 51:53.620]  Stoners and people jerking off.
[51:54.180 --> 51:56.260]  Two dudes staring at each other, smoking weed.
[51:56.420 --> 52:01.060]  Just what are you, what are you doing? What are you doing? While I was about to hit this,
[52:01.060 --> 52:05.380]  it's funny, like we both came on and we go, Hey, cause we recognized each other. And then I held
[52:05.380 --> 52:09.620]  up my rig and he held up his rig and we both started laughing like, yeah, taking dabs on
[52:09.620 --> 52:14.020]  chat roulette. Like everyone else has their wiener out on that channel and it's kind of weird.
[52:14.900 --> 52:19.540]  All right. If you're into online chatting with other stoners, there's a thing called puff,
[52:19.540 --> 52:24.340]  puff chat that I've heard about in a number of places, but I haven't actually attempted to enjoy
[52:24.340 --> 52:29.460]  trying to keep up with somebody. The last set of TV to fast forward, just to fuck with you.
[52:30.500 --> 52:34.980]  Like they're just dogging on these fucking things. And you're like, Oh, I can't keep up.
[52:35.620 --> 52:43.700]  Oh, this, this little tiny chick is kicking my ass. This is bullshit. I have no tolerance.
[52:43.700 --> 52:47.620]  So it'd be, I'd be done. I love puff puff. What was it? I think it was called puff,
[52:47.620 --> 52:51.860]  puff chat. The last time I got online for something that was designed for stoners to
[52:51.940 --> 52:56.900]  come together and get stoned on webcams together, it got shut down like an hour after it started.
[52:56.900 --> 53:01.700]  Like the DEA showed up and we're like, what are y'all doing? Videoing yourself committing crimes.
[53:01.700 --> 53:07.940]  Huh? This sounds fun. You can't prove it. And a oregano. Yeah. My Facebook page used to say,
[53:07.940 --> 53:13.380]  this is all an illusion. Nothing you see here is real. Like just to, and then we live in Colorado.
[53:13.380 --> 53:17.540]  I do live in Colorado and I take dabs and I've got the legal allowed amount of cannabis. So I
[53:17.540 --> 53:22.020]  don't give a shit right now. Um, that's right. All right. We got to start wrapping it up. We're
[53:22.020 --> 53:27.780]  close to an hour. Mike, you got any plugs or any shit to wrap the show up with? That's a blank stare.
[53:28.500 --> 53:33.620]  Clint, you start thinking I should have some notes about when the next commissioner meeting or when
[53:33.620 --> 53:39.780]  the next city council meeting is. But, uh, I don't guys, if you are a cannabis supporter in the city
[53:39.780 --> 53:45.380]  of Pueblo, Colorado, the County of Pueblo, Colorado, please follow Mike Nikon, not Nike,
[53:45.380 --> 53:50.660]  Nemo Punk, Nemo Punk 15 on Twitter. He's Nikon is what it comes up under the name there.
[53:50.660 --> 53:54.500]  It's confusing and obnoxious and a little soft Mark. But at this point I'm proud of a
[53:54.500 --> 53:59.140]  handful of my followers, like a couple of major news outlets follow my retarded ass. And I don't
[53:59.140 --> 54:06.180]  want to start over. So I'm just going to kind of bear that Nemo Punk 15 cross until Twitter implodes.
[54:06.180 --> 54:09.620]  Find him on there because he will tweet when all of the meetings are, he's going to take that
[54:09.620 --> 54:13.220]  responsibility. The city council meetings that we need to go to the commissioner's meetings,
[54:13.300 --> 54:16.660]  planning and zoning meetings. If it feels like there's a cannabis presence needed,
[54:16.660 --> 54:21.620]  Mike will start tweeting that stuff out for us. I grow culture. We'll start retweeting that.
[54:21.620 --> 54:25.860]  We'll have a little, uh, community action. Tall Clint will help. Tall Clint. It's your turn,
[54:25.860 --> 54:31.300]  buddy. Let's see your plugs. Uh, find me on Facebook and Instagram. Tall Clint, Twitter,
[54:31.300 --> 54:36.260]  tall Clint. It's all, I just stuck with the same thing because I want to brand it. I guess. I don't
[54:36.260 --> 54:41.940]  know. It works well. Talk words. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm Tom and I'm Clint. I hope you don't think
[54:41.940 --> 54:46.900]  it's cliff. It looked like another word. The first time I saw it on there, it did not look
[54:46.900 --> 54:52.580]  like it said Clint. There's no end in the words you're thinking of or there is an end in the world.
[54:52.580 --> 54:56.660]  You're thinking of when the L and the I become a U yes. Yeah. That one. It looks like the L and
[54:56.660 --> 55:02.740]  the I had United to a U if it was going to be in my name, it makes complete sense. That's why I
[55:02.740 --> 55:06.180]  thought, I think I said that word on the show earlier, actually. Yeah, you did. That's funny.
[55:06.180 --> 55:10.820]  I may edit that word out. I've never said that on a podcast. I can, I can't say the F one, but that
[55:10.820 --> 55:15.140]  one, that's weird. Yeah. Well, we're not trying to offend people and people get offended by that.
[55:15.140 --> 55:19.620]  All right. So if you have a charity hit Rasta Jeff up to, uh, to take another cuss word out
[55:19.620 --> 55:25.860]  of this vocabulary. Oh man. Um, guys, since everyone's doing plugs, check me out. I no
[55:25.860 --> 55:30.660]  longer have the IRIE genetics Facebook page that sucks. So follow, uh, at I grow culture on
[55:30.660 --> 55:34.500]  Instagram and Twitter. I grew culture has a Facebook page. Of course you can follow me.
[55:34.500 --> 55:39.140]  I've started posting dab videos and weed pictures on at Rasta Jeff for 20. That was hard to say for
[55:39.140 --> 55:44.900]  some reason. Um, I want to give a couple of shout outs. People left me some really cool comments on
[55:44.900 --> 55:49.620]  iTunes. Thank you guys for leaving the iTunes comments. Uh, this first comment is from hippie
[55:49.620 --> 55:53.380]  nurse, seven 10. What up hippie nurse? Hope you're doing well. You were having a rough day. I hope
[55:53.380 --> 55:57.380]  listening to the podcast and hearing a shout out makes you smile. You've got a rough job and I
[55:57.380 --> 56:02.100]  appreciate what you do. Um, she's a nurse at night, dude. God, I have so much respect for that. She
[56:02.100 --> 56:07.140]  doesn't know how much respect I have for it, but maybe she will now. Um, her comment says, and she
[56:07.140 --> 56:11.300]  gave us five stars. Thanks for that. Her comment says, I have been a listener since episode one. I
[56:11.300 --> 56:15.700]  can hear a difference in the tone, quality, and flow of each episode. As you progress, you guys
[56:15.700 --> 56:20.020]  are getting better and better with each episode. I love that you keep it light and informative.
[56:20.020 --> 56:25.300]  It makes it easier for newbies like myself to understand, keep up the good work. I love it.
[56:25.300 --> 56:28.260]  Yeah, that's what we're aiming for. So thanks a lot. Hippie nurse. Thank you for listening since
[56:28.260 --> 56:34.100]  episode one. Um, she used to always, she would tweet me and message me like, when is the new
[56:34.100 --> 56:37.300]  episode coming? When is the new episode coming? And I was like, it comes out at seven, 10 in the
[56:37.300 --> 56:42.820]  morning on Mondays. And she said, I work nights. Can it come out at 4 20 AM? And so now it comes
[56:42.820 --> 56:47.540]  out. That's why it pops up kind of randomly late at night on Sundays so that she can listen to it
[56:47.540 --> 56:51.780]  on her Sunday shift at work. That's what we do for the listeners. And she sent us a nice comment.
[56:51.780 --> 56:54.900]  So thanks. It works out well. I hope you're doing well. Hippie nurse. Yeah. We need some more five
[56:54.900 --> 57:00.660]  stars guys, please. Yeah. Well, we got another one. This guy, Billy Bob Ray. No, it's Billy
[57:00.660 --> 57:09.940]  Bobo Ray. Billy Bobo Ray. Yeah. Billy Bobo Ray. That could be the guy. Charles. He's not just
[57:09.940 --> 57:16.260]  from Oregon or South Carolina or a bubble Shanti Rastafarian. All possibilities. All of them. I
[57:16.260 --> 57:20.500]  like this guy. Uh, or his middle name could be Bobo. Also you might have the same problem. I have
[57:20.500 --> 57:26.740]  with a bad handle though, bro. So he says Rasta Jeff is fun to listen to, but be prepared for
[57:26.740 --> 57:30.740]  some stoner moments. Like where was this conversation going and what were we talking
[57:30.740 --> 57:37.140]  about? Hey dude, that happens. We are smoking. We're smoking award-winning hash award-winning
[57:37.140 --> 57:41.620]  flowers. Um, I don't think he was being disparaging on that. No, I think it was kind of just a,
[57:41.620 --> 57:46.500]  here you go guys. It's fun. It's going to happen. He's right. Sometimes I don't take offense to
[57:46.500 --> 57:51.220]  that. That's accurate. Shit. I'm high. It's going to happen. Fuck. Yeah. That's part of the fun of
[57:51.220 --> 57:55.620]  the whole thing though. Uh, I sometimes random shit is where the good shit comes out. I used
[57:55.620 --> 58:00.100]  to script almost everything. I used to type out like a lot of what I was going to say. And then I
[58:00.100 --> 58:03.220]  listened to the episodes and it felt like this. Good evening. Thank you for listening to
[58:03.220 --> 58:08.420]  agriculture podcast. My name is Jeff. And now I write like bullet points and try to rant on those
[58:08.420 --> 58:12.500]  bullet points and keep it moving. Cause it feels a lot better. Yeah. But that does create those
[58:12.500 --> 58:18.580]  stoner moments. That's for sure. How's he doing? Billy Bobo Ray. Yeah. He was saying, you were
[58:18.580 --> 58:21.060]  saying you were going to keep reading this thing. Oh, that's, that's what he wrote. That's what he
[58:21.060 --> 58:26.340]  wrote. And he gave us four stars. So that's cool enough for works for works. I passed middle
[58:26.340 --> 58:34.180]  school with a 60. So, so this is way better. I like it. I like it. Dude. Thanks for leaving a
[58:34.180 --> 58:40.660]  comment. Billy Bobo Ray, Billy Bob, Bob Ray. We apologize for butchering your name repeatedly.
[58:40.660 --> 58:44.420]  I'm high and making it fun. It's cool. I'm not butchering it. It's got me entertained as she,
[58:44.420 --> 58:48.660]  I don't think we had any, where's this going moments this episode. I think this whole episode
[58:48.660 --> 58:53.940]  was aware of the hell is this going? I felt like Jeff was trying to drag me back to the point like
[58:53.940 --> 58:57.780]  for an hour. Well, just not an hour, but you know, there's a couple of good minutes in there
[58:57.780 --> 59:03.540]  guys. I hope you heard me trying to put him back on track. We got on nature box for at least 10
[59:05.140 --> 59:09.780]  those fucking almonds were great. All right. Don't go back. Don't go back. We got to go back.
[59:10.660 --> 59:16.020]  We already sold that product. There you go. Bobo. I fixed it. I saved it. I wish that I could get my
[59:16.020 --> 59:22.580]  nature box at high grow indoor growing supplies. All right. Um, we're going to wrap this up guys.
[59:22.580 --> 59:26.900]  Um, I have Jesse coming back in a couple of episodes. I'm not sure if he'll be back this
[59:26.900 --> 59:31.540]  week or in about 10 days. He's hard to get here. He's a busy man. He's married. He works several
[59:31.540 --> 59:35.860]  jobs. He's an awesome dude. He's worth waiting for, but we're going to discuss building your
[59:35.860 --> 59:42.260]  grow room. People have asked also a listener said that they have a $500 budget and they would like
[59:42.340 --> 59:47.060]  to learn how to grow a small grow room to supply themselves. I have a couple of good ideas on how
[59:47.060 --> 59:50.580]  that might work. So I'm going to work on that for you. We'll put an episode together. I have a couple
[59:50.580 --> 59:54.740]  of news articles that I did not read on this show. So there'll be coming up in the next episode.
[59:54.740 --> 59:57.940]  Dude, thank you guys for listening. I'm going to read that part that I read at the end of the show.
[59:57.940 --> 01:00:02.020]  It goes like this. Now that the show is over, please go to iTunes, go to the iTunes store,
[01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:06.740]  search for I grow culture, find the review section. Give me a five or a four star rating.
[01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:09.780]  After that type in a comment, let me know what you think of the show. And I'll read your comments
[01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:13.300]  on the show. Stitcher listeners, you guys can do the same thing. They've updated Stitcher and
[01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:20.180]  the comments work now. Don't forget that the show is available on iTunes, Stitcher, and every single
[01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:26.740]  episode is archived on ireeneticscolorado.com. Make sure you browse around on ireeneticscolorado.com.
[01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:31.860]  Check out the gallery, check out the genetics page. If you're interested, join the forum. I,
[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:35.540]  I will communicate with you through that forum quite often. Since Facebook kind of gave me the
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:40.180]  middle finger, I spend a lot more time on the forum. I'm also adding videos to YouTube right
[01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:43.940]  now. They're nothing fancy as I get caught up. The videos are getting better and better and better.
[01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:48.020]  So if you can't listen through iTunes, Stitcher, or the website, you can always check them out on
[01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:52.740]  YouTube. I posted some pictures in there also that may be interesting to you. Also a big shout
[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:56.020]  out to my ninja Spence. I want to thank you guys for listening. Thank you guys for coming to the
[01:00:56.020 --> 01:01:00.100]  podcast tonight, taking some time out of your night. Thanks brother. Thanks for having me, man.
[01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:04.180]  Yeah. And if you guys got questions, like Jeff said, just ask him, man. Ask the thing,
[01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:07.700]  ask. I love to answer the questions. That's what I'm here for. You know, I don't feel,
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:11.540]  I'm not here to entertain myself. It does feel really great to put this out, but I'm here to
[01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:16.260]  help everybody out. I've got a good grasp on this. I love podcasting. So I'm here to help you guys
[01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:33.680]  out until next time, guys, take a fat dab. Give your mom a hug for me.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:48.560]  She'll fight. Is she thinking about me? Is that she set my heart free?
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:55.600]  How did this your cut dress? It's getting worse. How much does it hurt dress? It hurts so much.
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:02:00.880]  Yeah. I'll be visual cut dress. It's getting worse. When will it heal?
