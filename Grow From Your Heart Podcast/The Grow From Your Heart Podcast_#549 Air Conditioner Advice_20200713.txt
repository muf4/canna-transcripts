[00:54.370 --> 00:58.250]  I'd like to start the podcast off by giving a giant thank you shout out to my buddy dinks
[00:58.250 --> 01:01.150]  for nothing for the perfect podcast intro track.
[01:01.150 --> 01:02.150]  Thank you, bro.
[01:02.150 --> 01:04.290]  That fits very well and I appreciate your work.
[01:04.290 --> 01:05.290]  All right.
[01:05.290 --> 01:08.250]  This is the point of the show where I talk about what I'm smoking today.
[01:08.250 --> 01:13.890]  I've been taking ridiculous dabs of holy fuck full spectrum extract from green dot labs.
[01:13.890 --> 01:17.490]  This is a blend of sex on the beach and halo on the package.
[01:17.490 --> 01:20.550]  The flavor is described as pina colada and fuel.
[01:20.550 --> 01:23.850]  That is a very unique description, but I'm going to agree.
[01:23.850 --> 01:28.310]  When you inhale, there's a fruitiness that pina colada coconut kind of pineapple taste
[01:28.310 --> 01:30.850]  that tropical flavor overwhelms my mouth.
[01:30.850 --> 01:34.410]  Then on the exhale, my tongue goes dry and it tastes like fruity fuel.
[01:34.410 --> 01:39.190]  So I completely agree with a pina colada and fuel flavor on the back of the package.
[01:39.190 --> 01:46.890]  It says the THC level is 59.29% and non detectable amounts of CBD.
[01:46.890 --> 01:51.850]  Big shout out to our friends at green dot labs for the delicious, holy fuck full spectrum
[01:51.850 --> 01:53.050]  extract.
[01:53.050 --> 01:57.090]  And speaking of holy fuck, holy fuck you guys, it is super hot today.
[01:57.090 --> 02:01.410]  It is the hottest day that we have experienced here in Southern Colorado this summer, and
[02:01.410 --> 02:03.250]  I am feeling it.
[02:03.250 --> 02:06.330]  That has led up to a bunch of great podcast questions.
[02:06.330 --> 02:10.130]  It sounds like a lot of other people across the country, across the world are having heat
[02:10.130 --> 02:11.510]  issues and their grows.
[02:11.510 --> 02:13.930]  So in this episode, we are going to talk about air conditioning.
[02:13.930 --> 02:18.050]  We're going to address a couple of air conditioning questions before we get there.
[02:18.050 --> 02:22.070]  Let's do some shout outs to a few of the folks who support the show on Patreon.
[02:22.070 --> 02:25.110]  Let's give a giant shout out to the members of the 710 club.
[02:25.110 --> 02:29.330]  These are folks who support the show at the 710 level or higher on Patreon.
[02:29.330 --> 02:33.150]  Let's start off with the big shout out to the leader, the captain and commander of the
[02:33.150 --> 02:34.150]  710 club.
[02:34.150 --> 02:37.090]  Let's give a big thank you shout out to my buddy lemur priest.
[02:37.090 --> 02:40.270]  Let's follow that up with a big thank you shout out to my buddy Kurt Z.
[02:40.270 --> 02:43.750]  I've always got a thank you shout out to easy 057.
[02:43.750 --> 02:46.810]  Also let's send a big thank you shout out to my friend Zoso J.
[02:46.810 --> 02:49.510]  I also want to send a big thank you to our friend Heli.
[02:49.510 --> 02:53.410]  We've always got a big thank you shout out and a fist bump to Kanna Organic.
[02:53.410 --> 02:58.190]  I want to send a big thank you to Jacob W. Let's send a shout out to Godfather Kush.
[02:58.190 --> 03:00.390]  Let's send a big thank you to Lernon and Burnin.
[03:00.390 --> 03:04.350]  I've always got a big thank you for Redbeard, part of that Redbeard crew.
[03:04.350 --> 03:06.990]  Also let's send a big giant grow from your heart podcast.
[03:06.990 --> 03:12.230]  Thank you shout out to my friend Keith K. Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
[03:12.230 --> 03:14.750]  who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[03:14.750 --> 03:18.350]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[03:18.350 --> 03:24.910]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[03:24.910 --> 03:27.270]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[03:27.270 --> 03:31.230]  Of course, I did include a link in the show notes to make it easy for everybody who has
[03:31.230 --> 03:32.470]  got their hands full.
[03:32.470 --> 03:35.990]  All right, you guys, I don't want to waste a lot of time today.
[03:35.990 --> 03:40.390]  Let's jump right into the Patreon question part of the podcast.
[03:40.390 --> 03:42.990]  I've got a question here that comes from our friend Karen Crawford.
[03:42.990 --> 03:46.190]  Karen, thank you for the continued Patreon support.
[03:46.190 --> 03:48.750]  And also thank you for the great question.
[03:48.750 --> 03:51.190]  This one goes a lot like this.
[03:51.190 --> 03:56.470]  It says, hey, Rostagef, first off, can I just ask how the hell you manage to do all you
[03:56.470 --> 03:57.470]  do?
[03:57.470 --> 04:03.870]  Growing, breeding, consulting, multiple podcasts, emails, social media, sales, dabbing, and
[04:03.870 --> 04:07.110]  somewhere in there, you got to have some sort of a personal life.
[04:07.110 --> 04:10.390]  I don't know how you do it, but I do know we all appreciate it.
[04:10.390 --> 04:12.430]  So thank you.
[04:12.430 --> 04:13.710]  Thank you for noticing, Karen.
[04:13.710 --> 04:15.670]  This has become my life.
[04:15.670 --> 04:17.590]  This is not something I do.
[04:17.590 --> 04:18.590]  It's something I do for fun.
[04:18.590 --> 04:20.110]  It's not just something I do as a hobby.
[04:20.110 --> 04:21.630]  This is what I do, you guys.
[04:21.630 --> 04:22.790]  I breed seeds.
[04:22.790 --> 04:23.910]  I do consulting.
[04:23.910 --> 04:25.150]  I do podcasting.
[04:25.150 --> 04:26.150]  This is my life.
[04:26.150 --> 04:27.150]  I am in it.
[04:27.150 --> 04:28.230]  I am not just playing.
[04:28.230 --> 04:30.230]  I'm not just hanging out in the cannabis world.
[04:30.230 --> 04:31.710]  I am fucking immersed in it.
[04:31.710 --> 04:33.270]  I wake up and it's cannabis time.
[04:33.270 --> 04:36.430]  I fall asleep and it was cannabis time all day.
[04:36.430 --> 04:39.270]  Being a seed breeder, owning a seed company is not a hobby.
[04:39.270 --> 04:43.710]  It's not something if you want to breed and put seeds to market at the level, which I
[04:43.710 --> 04:45.590]  do, it is not a hobby.
[04:45.630 --> 04:47.110]  It's something you have to run like a business.
[04:47.110 --> 04:49.270]  It's a farm and a farm business.
[04:49.270 --> 04:50.510]  It has to be operated as such.
[04:50.510 --> 04:51.950]  I don't get to take a lot of days off.
[04:51.950 --> 04:52.950]  I'm not complaining.
[04:52.950 --> 04:55.030]  I'm just saying this is a lifestyle and I'm dedicated.
[04:55.030 --> 04:56.230]  I love doing it.
[04:56.230 --> 04:59.870]  If you want to be successful as a breeder, successful as a content provider, you have
[04:59.870 --> 05:01.230]  got to stay relevant.
[05:01.230 --> 05:02.430]  You've got to be on top of shit.
[05:02.430 --> 05:03.550]  You've got to be there.
[05:03.550 --> 05:05.350]  If I don't put out a show, I disappear.
[05:05.350 --> 05:07.430]  If I don't put out a new strain, I disappear.
[05:07.430 --> 05:08.550]  So it's constant work.
[05:08.550 --> 05:09.550]  It never stops.
[05:09.550 --> 05:10.550]  It's always evolving.
[05:10.550 --> 05:15.030]  If you think you're going to do it, know that it's going to be a lifestyle, not just a job,
[05:15.030 --> 05:16.590]  not just a hobby.
[05:16.590 --> 05:17.590]  Let's see.
[05:17.590 --> 05:18.590]  Growing.
[05:18.590 --> 05:19.590]  Growing is what I have to do.
[05:19.590 --> 05:21.030]  If I didn't grow, none of this would work.
[05:21.030 --> 05:24.270]  Growing is growing and playing the drums are two things that I have to do.
[05:24.270 --> 05:27.270]  If I didn't do those, something would go wrong with me mentally and physically.
[05:27.270 --> 05:28.870]  A screw would come undone.
[05:28.870 --> 05:29.870]  Springs would pop out somewhere.
[05:29.870 --> 05:31.270]  It would just be terrible.
[05:31.270 --> 05:32.270]  Breeding.
[05:32.270 --> 05:33.270]  I love to breed.
[05:33.270 --> 05:35.510]  I love making new seeds and growing them.
[05:35.510 --> 05:39.070]  And then I love seeing you guys have success in your garden with the great things I breed.
[05:39.070 --> 05:40.070]  So that's awesome.
[05:40.070 --> 05:41.070]  Consulting.
[05:41.070 --> 05:42.810]  I love going to big grows.
[05:42.810 --> 05:44.030]  It keeps me up to speed.
[05:44.030 --> 05:45.150]  It keeps me up to tech.
[05:45.150 --> 05:48.390]  I get to see what all these other people bought and then I get to play with it and learn how
[05:48.390 --> 05:50.030]  to make it work.
[05:50.030 --> 05:51.530]  Owners get these big ideas.
[05:51.530 --> 05:53.070]  Somebody told them to buy some crazy shit.
[05:53.070 --> 05:55.870]  So they bought it because they had money and the investor was like, we don't know what
[05:55.870 --> 05:56.870]  we need.
[05:56.870 --> 05:57.870]  So they bought it.
[05:57.870 --> 05:58.870]  The person that told them to buy it disappeared.
[05:58.870 --> 06:00.790]  It was just some fucking dude they knew.
[06:00.790 --> 06:02.190]  And they need somebody to work it.
[06:02.190 --> 06:04.590]  So they call me and I get to go play with so many great toys.
[06:04.590 --> 06:08.710]  So that keeps my sword sharp, so to speak.
[06:08.710 --> 06:09.710]  Multiple podcasts.
[06:09.710 --> 06:13.430]  Yes, I am here on this show a minimum of twice a week.
[06:13.830 --> 06:16.270]  I am working on improving and increasing the amount of shows.
[06:16.270 --> 06:17.870]  I do the embracing organics show.
[06:17.870 --> 06:19.950]  I appear as a guest on quite a few other shows.
[06:19.950 --> 06:21.950]  Shout out to Scotty real and the dude.
[06:21.950 --> 06:23.230]  I'm on their show quite often.
[06:23.230 --> 06:26.630]  I try to do as many social media appearances as I can.
[06:26.630 --> 06:30.110]  I was held back by a couple of I needed some dental work and I got it done.
[06:30.110 --> 06:31.310]  So now let's do some fucking shows.
[06:31.310 --> 06:34.790]  You guys, I'm not so shy about the face anymore.
[06:34.790 --> 06:37.470]  Also where are we in this emails, social media.
[06:37.470 --> 06:38.990]  That is the first half of my day.
[06:38.990 --> 06:42.790]  I wake up and answer emails and then I try to catch up with them before I go to bed once
[06:42.830 --> 06:43.950]  more. Social media.
[06:43.950 --> 06:47.550]  I've been slacking on social media, but I do try to keep a presence there.
[06:47.550 --> 06:48.910]  Dabbing. I'm always dabbing.
[06:48.910 --> 06:50.990]  You guys always dabbing and somewhere in between there.
[06:50.990 --> 06:53.150]  You got to have some sort of a personal life.
[06:53.150 --> 06:54.910]  I try to have a little bit of a personal life.
[06:54.910 --> 06:56.350]  I got Mike around. He's my buddy.
[06:56.350 --> 06:58.470]  Dabbing. Matt comes around.
[06:58.470 --> 07:01.110]  Quite a few people come and hang out when it's not quarantine time.
[07:01.110 --> 07:02.510]  We do zoom and shit.
[07:02.510 --> 07:06.510]  But a lot of times this social media stuff, my Instagram live and the things like
[07:06.510 --> 07:09.990]  that, that is a lot of my social interaction because I don't get a lot of time to go
[07:09.990 --> 07:11.270]  explore and do a lot of shit.
[07:11.270 --> 07:14.790]  So you guys that I do interact with, you are my social interaction.
[07:14.790 --> 07:16.470]  So thank you. That shit means a lot to me.
[07:16.470 --> 07:17.910]  Now I'm rambling from that.
[07:17.910 --> 07:19.070]  Holy fuck, Deb.
[07:19.070 --> 07:21.190]  I think I've got a brain bake from the heat.
[07:21.190 --> 07:23.870]  And then also I'm fucking extra bake from the holy fuck.
[07:23.870 --> 07:26.750]  So I'm going to move into the actual important part of this message.
[07:26.750 --> 07:29.430]  Karen, thank you for noticing all of the hard work I'm doing.
[07:29.430 --> 07:31.870]  I goes on to say I'm a caregiver in Michigan.
[07:31.870 --> 07:34.670]  And a couple of months ago, you were kind enough to answer a question I had about
[07:34.670 --> 07:36.550]  extracts and why you don't prefer rosen.
[07:36.550 --> 07:37.950]  I definitely remember.
[07:37.950 --> 07:41.950]  It says this time I have a grow room question that I definitely need your expertise on.
[07:41.950 --> 07:43.190]  I am here to help.
[07:43.190 --> 07:48.990]  It says indoors, I have a 20 by or a 12 by 20 flower room in a basement with heating
[07:48.990 --> 07:50.150]  and cooling vented in.
[07:50.150 --> 07:55.030]  However, over the past couple of weeks, shit has been hot as hell outside in the AC
[07:55.030 --> 07:58.910]  house. The house AC isn't cooling the room enough.
[07:58.910 --> 07:59.990]  I feel your pain.
[07:59.990 --> 08:05.150]  It is it's 10 o'clock at night as I'm recording and it is still 91 degrees outside.
[08:05.150 --> 08:06.590]  So I'm sweating.
[08:06.590 --> 08:07.110]  It's hot.
[08:07.110 --> 08:08.430]  I've had the cooler on all day.
[08:08.430 --> 08:10.390]  It is finally cool in here.
[08:10.390 --> 08:12.750]  It hasn't been cool until right about now at 10 o'clock.
[08:12.750 --> 08:14.350]  So I feel your pain.
[08:14.350 --> 08:14.870]  It's hot.
[08:14.870 --> 08:17.270]  The whole country is getting hot right now.
[08:17.270 --> 08:23.910]  You're running six to eight plants under four HLG 550s and two Bestva 2000 watt
[08:23.910 --> 08:27.510]  reflector series budget burples to vary the spectrum.
[08:27.510 --> 08:30.830]  And even though I run my lights at night from 5 p.m.
[08:30.830 --> 08:35.990]  to 5 a.m. with it being in the mid 90s, every day temps are raising between 85 and 88.
[08:36.030 --> 08:41.430]  Even with my Hurricane 20 inch pro velocity fan on them and the dehumidifier set to 60
[08:41.430 --> 08:42.830]  percent. All right.
[08:42.830 --> 08:44.550]  So it's getting hot in there.
[08:44.550 --> 08:46.070]  She told us what kind of light she's got.
[08:46.070 --> 08:47.550]  We know what size the space is.
[08:49.590 --> 08:52.310]  She's got the right idea running the lights from 5 p.m.
[08:52.310 --> 08:53.630]  to 5 a.m.
[08:53.630 --> 08:54.670]  It's cooler at that point.
[08:54.670 --> 08:55.790]  You don't have to fight the sun.
[08:55.790 --> 08:57.190]  It's easier to cool the grow room.
[08:57.190 --> 08:59.150]  Also, electricity is cheaper.
[08:59.150 --> 09:02.510]  Many electrical companies will charge you a premium price for the electric during the
[09:02.510 --> 09:04.070]  day because everybody's functioning.
[09:04.070 --> 09:05.630]  All the businesses need power.
[09:05.670 --> 09:06.870]  It is cheaper at night.
[09:06.870 --> 09:08.190]  So you're off to a good start.
[09:08.870 --> 09:11.150]  The Hurricane 20 inch pro fan.
[09:11.950 --> 09:13.790]  Guys, here's a note you need to keep in your brain.
[09:13.790 --> 09:15.750]  Fans do not create cool air.
[09:15.750 --> 09:17.230]  They move the air around.
[09:17.230 --> 09:18.470]  They circulate air.
[09:18.470 --> 09:22.190]  If it's getting too hot from a heat source, you need something to battle the heat source.
[09:22.550 --> 09:24.030]  The fan doesn't battle it.
[09:24.030 --> 09:24.870]  It moves it around.
[09:24.870 --> 09:25.990]  It makes it comfortable.
[09:25.990 --> 09:27.790]  You need something to fight the heat.
[09:27.790 --> 09:29.750]  If you're making heat, you need something to make cool.
[09:30.070 --> 09:31.830]  So here we are at this point.
[09:31.830 --> 09:34.910]  We have got 58 to or 85 to 88 degrees.
[09:35.310 --> 09:36.430]  60 percent humidity.
[09:36.430 --> 09:40.670]  It says, I'm afraid my girls are going to get very unhappy soon if this continues.
[09:40.830 --> 09:42.910]  So I have purchased a winter.
[09:42.910 --> 09:44.550]  It's W.H.Y.N.T.E.R.
[09:44.550 --> 09:45.630]  That's said winter.
[09:45.630 --> 09:51.270]  If you guys have seen those when you're shopping a winter 14000 BTU ARC S.H.
[09:51.270 --> 09:52.510]  portable AC unit.
[09:52.670 --> 09:55.550]  But I have no clue how to vent this properly.
[09:56.150 --> 09:57.230]  These units are great.
[09:57.230 --> 10:00.550]  If you were in the right environment, if you don't have access to a window unit, if you
[10:00.550 --> 10:03.470]  don't have a window to put a unit in, these will work beautifully.
[10:03.470 --> 10:04.910]  I think you're on the right track.
[10:05.550 --> 10:07.830]  Just a little bit of guidance to install it.
[10:07.870 --> 10:13.030]  OK, I can help you there because I do have a room with it may be the exact same air
[10:13.030 --> 10:14.670]  conditioner, if not a similar model.
[10:14.670 --> 10:17.830]  I've got a winter 14000 BTU portable air conditioner.
[10:19.350 --> 10:22.070]  Yeah, so let's talk about some of your questions.
[10:22.070 --> 10:26.550]  I have a small 11 by 30 inch window that I could use, but I'm nervous about number
[10:26.550 --> 10:30.150]  one, bugs, number two, light leaks and number three, odor.
[10:30.150 --> 10:32.110]  Those are all valid concerns.
[10:32.350 --> 10:37.430]  It says I've had 10 different people give me 10 different answers on this, and I don't
[10:37.430 --> 10:38.470]  want to fuck this up.
[10:38.910 --> 10:41.310]  What would be the best possible way to do this?
[10:41.350 --> 10:45.150]  Keeping all these things in mind and with the knowledge that I have a 70 year old woman
[10:45.150 --> 10:49.790]  living very closely to the side that it will be vented out, who has already complained
[10:49.790 --> 10:52.150]  to me about the smell of marijuana.
[10:52.870 --> 10:55.430]  That crazy old lady is going to be the bane of your existence.
[10:55.430 --> 10:56.550]  I'm sorry she's over there.
[10:56.950 --> 10:57.990]  It says I apologize for it.
[10:57.990 --> 10:58.550]  You know what you got to do?
[10:58.550 --> 10:59.470]  You got to burn one with her.
[10:59.470 --> 11:01.270]  And if you saw me spit on the microphone, I apologize.
[11:01.270 --> 11:02.910]  You got to go burn one with her and make her your friend.
[11:03.230 --> 11:04.830]  Give her some topicals, make her feel better.
[11:05.030 --> 11:07.750]  I apologize for my lack of knowledge when it comes to HVAC.
[11:07.990 --> 11:10.310]  I don't apologize for lack of any knowledge.
[11:10.310 --> 11:12.750]  I'm sure you know plenty of shit because you've made it this far in life.
[11:13.070 --> 11:14.350]  This message is well typed.
[11:14.390 --> 11:14.990]  You know enough.
[11:15.030 --> 11:15.510]  You're okay.
[11:15.510 --> 11:16.470]  Don't apologize.
[11:16.870 --> 11:21.670]  And this may be simple, but for someone with varied responses, I sure as hell am
[11:21.670 --> 11:23.270]  concerned and I want it done right.
[11:23.310 --> 11:23.910]  I like that.
[11:24.150 --> 11:25.190]  I get it right the first time.
[11:25.190 --> 11:26.510]  We don't have to keep overdoing it.
[11:26.870 --> 11:31.230]  One solution was to remove the window, replace a piece of plywood, pre-cut for
[11:31.230 --> 11:31.750]  the hoses.
[11:31.750 --> 11:32.030]  Okay.
[11:32.030 --> 11:33.070]  You were on the right path.
[11:33.070 --> 11:34.910]  Let's just start talking about how I would do this.
[11:35.310 --> 11:39.790]  I have got a very similar window setup with a very similar air
[11:39.790 --> 11:40.950]  conditioner in the window.
[11:41.270 --> 11:42.470]  I did not use plywood.
[11:42.470 --> 11:43.470]  I opted to use.
[11:44.030 --> 11:45.630]  I'm not sure what it's supposed to be for.
[11:45.630 --> 11:46.830]  I am not a construction guy.
[11:46.830 --> 11:47.790]  I'm not a handyman.
[11:48.190 --> 11:49.150]  That is not my realm.
[11:49.150 --> 11:49.990]  I'll admit that shit.
[11:49.990 --> 11:50.950]  You're not good at HVAC.
[11:50.950 --> 11:52.790]  I don't know what the shit at Lowe's is called.
[11:52.990 --> 11:53.710]  I point and grunt.
[11:53.710 --> 11:54.470]  We get what we need.
[11:54.910 --> 11:57.710]  Um, I use some blue insulation board.
[11:57.710 --> 11:58.430]  It's blue.
[11:58.590 --> 11:59.190]  It's foam.
[11:59.190 --> 12:00.550]  It looks like it's for insulation.
[12:00.550 --> 12:03.590]  I think it's got a diamond shape and it may say DuPont in the middle of it.
[12:04.030 --> 12:07.310]  Uh, I don't get the one with the silver reflective on either side.
[12:07.310 --> 12:08.830]  They offer it with the silver reflective.
[12:08.830 --> 12:09.830]  I do not buy that.
[12:10.230 --> 12:11.270]  I buy the foam board.
[12:11.270 --> 12:13.870]  I think it is one and a half to two inches thick.
[12:13.910 --> 12:15.390]  They make it in different thicknesses.
[12:15.750 --> 12:19.070]  In my basement window, the window well is quite wide.
[12:19.070 --> 12:22.510]  It's as wide as the basement foundation, as wide as the house was built.
[12:22.790 --> 12:24.870]  So I can press, I take out the window.
[12:25.110 --> 12:26.910]  I took it, the glass and the frame are gone.
[12:26.910 --> 12:29.830]  They simply popped out of the fucking, the square where the window goes.
[12:30.110 --> 12:30.910]  I popped that out.
[12:31.190 --> 12:35.510]  I cut a square of that blue foam insulation and I popped it in there as tight as it would go.
[12:35.990 --> 12:38.110]  Then I used Gorilla Kalk.
[12:38.110 --> 12:39.150]  It's a spray foam.
[12:39.270 --> 12:41.150]  You can put it, you're going to ruin your clothes.
[12:41.150 --> 12:43.910]  Wear some clothes you can destroy, wear some gloves, tie up your hair.
[12:44.190 --> 12:46.230]  If you got dreadlocks, get that shit out of the way.
[12:46.550 --> 12:49.230]  The Gorilla Kalk is a mess and it gets everywhere.
[12:49.230 --> 12:50.230]  It is hard to clean up.
[12:50.230 --> 12:51.110]  It's a pain in the ass.
[12:51.110 --> 12:55.430]  Karen saw photos of the area where I applied the Gorilla Kalk, all that spattery stuff.
[12:55.670 --> 12:56.870]  That's what I could not clean up.
[12:56.870 --> 12:57.790]  It sucks to work with.
[12:57.830 --> 12:59.110]  Be more careful than I was.
[12:59.470 --> 13:02.390]  Seal all the way around that window with the Gorilla Kalk.
[13:02.670 --> 13:05.190]  Then make multiple layers of duct tape over it.
[13:05.470 --> 13:06.470]  Don't do the duct tape yet.
[13:06.470 --> 13:07.310]  We're going to do that next.
[13:08.110 --> 13:09.310]  But seal it with duct tape.
[13:09.710 --> 13:17.110]  Then take your ducts from the air conditioner and trace the size of the hole and make a hole and cut that hole out.
[13:17.310 --> 13:23.670]  Now, what I choose to do is I went to the growth store and the ducts I am using are six inches in diameter.
[13:23.670 --> 13:26.110]  The air conditioner I purchased has a six inch duct.
[13:26.670 --> 13:29.030]  I grabbed a six inch metal flange.
[13:29.030 --> 13:31.030]  It's just a piece about this long and it's six.
[13:31.030 --> 13:35.390]  I'm holding up my hands probably 10 or 11 inches, maybe 12 inches long.
[13:35.630 --> 13:38.310]  Just a piece of sheet metal ducting wrapped into a duct.
[13:38.310 --> 13:41.950]  It's six inches in diameter and 10 to 12 inches long.
[13:42.230 --> 13:45.630]  And I push that through the foam board.
[13:45.630 --> 13:49.470]  I measure it, cut a hole, push that through the foam board, tape that securely into place.
[13:49.830 --> 13:53.270]  The foam board is taped into the wall, also held in with Gorilla Kalk.
[13:53.510 --> 13:54.670]  Then I put the metal in there.
[13:54.790 --> 13:59.990]  Then I attach the ducting to the metal just to give it something to attach to, something strong to support on.
[14:00.310 --> 14:02.270]  Then I duct tape the shit out of it.
[14:02.470 --> 14:04.790]  I want to catch up into your message and see where we are.
[14:05.070 --> 14:07.390]  Um, I've kind of lost my spot.
[14:08.190 --> 14:11.750]  Window replaced with a piece of plywood pre-cut for the hoses.
[14:12.030 --> 14:13.110]  Um, yes, you can do that.
[14:13.110 --> 14:14.710]  You can pre-cut or you can post cut.
[14:14.710 --> 14:16.710]  It was easier for me to cut once it was up there.
[14:16.990 --> 14:18.550]  I just hang the thing and measure.
[14:18.550 --> 14:19.990]  It was easy, but cut it as you need.
[14:20.470 --> 14:23.190]  Uh, then you want to screw the window into the frame and caulk it.
[14:23.430 --> 14:24.190]  That would work.
[14:24.190 --> 14:27.270]  I use the foam insulation, uh, because it's easier to cut.
[14:27.670 --> 14:29.350]  Uh, and it's, uh, it's insulated.
[14:29.350 --> 14:30.710]  It's already insulated.
[14:30.990 --> 14:34.110]  But the good part about the wood is it's going to be lightproof.
[14:34.150 --> 14:38.310]  I have to duct tape the inside of my room to make sure no light comes through when I use this.
[14:38.310 --> 14:40.030]  So where are we here?
[14:40.630 --> 14:47.030]  Uh, caulked, but how do I filter it to ensure bugs and or light can't get through the intake or outtake hoses?
[14:47.030 --> 14:50.430]  That is a very good question and a very good challenge.
[14:50.830 --> 14:53.110]  One of those hoses spits out heat.
[14:53.710 --> 14:57.190]  Um, I usually put black pantyhose over the end of that.
[14:57.230 --> 15:00.270]  Just put pantyhose, just like a condom and duct tape it in place.
[15:00.590 --> 15:04.710]  It'll blow and you'll see that flap in the wind a little bit, but the pantyhose prevents anything from coming in.
[15:04.950 --> 15:06.030]  Put it on both sides.
[15:06.390 --> 15:10.390]  I do not use the, um, the duct in.
[15:10.550 --> 15:12.030]  I only use the duct out.
[15:12.030 --> 15:13.990]  That way I'm not pulling the air from outside.
[15:14.470 --> 15:18.430]  It makes the air conditioner struggle a little bit because you're using that humidity in the room.
[15:18.910 --> 15:26.910]  But when it's 120 outside and it's only 85 in my room, I feel it's easier for the air conditioner to use that air that's already in the room.
[15:26.910 --> 15:28.110]  And then it just blows the heat out.
[15:28.110 --> 15:32.710]  It's less circulation and cycling going through my machine, less ducting that I've got.
[15:33.430 --> 15:34.750]  I don't use that second hose.
[15:34.750 --> 15:37.150]  I just leave it open and I put a filter over that.
[15:37.430 --> 15:39.590]  So a pantyhose is the cheap way to do that.
[15:39.870 --> 15:45.630]  Uh, if you're confident that it's not going to heat up enough to cause a problem on the pantyhose, by the time it gets down that far, it should be okay.
[15:45.990 --> 15:47.670]  But make sure you put your hand over and check.
[15:47.670 --> 15:49.150]  So that's how I filter it.
[15:49.150 --> 15:49.750]  Pantyhose.
[15:49.910 --> 15:51.390]  That is super high tech.
[15:51.670 --> 15:53.510]  Um, it's really cost effective.
[15:53.670 --> 15:54.870]  That's a million dollar trick.
[15:55.030 --> 15:55.790]  Pantyhose, bro.
[15:56.070 --> 15:56.790]  Uh, where are we?
[15:56.870 --> 15:57.630]  Or ma'am?
[15:57.670 --> 15:58.030]  Sorry.
[15:58.230 --> 15:59.070]  I shouldn't call you bro.
[15:59.070 --> 16:00.150]  You're one of the bros by now.
[16:00.190 --> 16:01.230]  I hope you're, you're one of us.
[16:01.230 --> 16:01.710]  Come hang out.
[16:02.030 --> 16:02.950]  One of the grow bros.
[16:03.070 --> 16:04.190]  Nothing but respect either way.
[16:04.670 --> 16:10.270]  Um, I don't want to say this out loud, but mites are the only grower problem I haven't dealt with.
[16:10.270 --> 16:11.870]  Well, uh, you'll get mites eventually.
[16:11.870 --> 16:12.870]  Where else are we in this?
[16:13.110 --> 16:17.110]  And how do I go about this smell venting out and blasting the intake out of the hoses?
[16:18.550 --> 16:22.150]  I do not think it cycles much air from your room.
[16:22.150 --> 16:23.430]  You've got the two hose model.
[16:23.430 --> 16:25.710]  So you are going to be pulling air in through that.
[16:25.910 --> 16:27.710]  It's going to go over the compressor and out.
[16:27.710 --> 16:31.750]  You may need to use both hoses and then it creates a loop and that air doesn't touch your grow.
[16:32.070 --> 16:34.190]  You aren't pulling air from the grow and pushing it out.
[16:34.190 --> 16:34.870]  You're just pulling out.
[16:34.870 --> 16:37.030]  It's a loop and that should work for you.
[16:37.270 --> 16:38.830]  I can't make any promises that way.
[16:38.830 --> 16:43.550]  Use the two hoses and you create a continuous loop and the air doesn't get sucked from your grow.
[16:43.590 --> 16:45.150]  The odor doesn't get sucked and blown out.
[16:45.710 --> 16:48.790]  You may need another carbon filter in the grow room.
[16:48.830 --> 16:52.310]  Just put a carbon filter with a blower in it, right in front of the air conditioner.
[16:52.590 --> 16:54.390]  Uh, that'll help stir the air around.
[16:54.390 --> 16:56.590]  Also, that'll suck out a bunch of aroma and odors.
[16:57.030 --> 17:00.350]  But if you do the loop, I don't think you're going to get much aroma.
[17:00.510 --> 17:02.710]  Where I am, I don't worry too much about aroma.
[17:02.710 --> 17:04.390]  The neighbors know who I am by now.
[17:04.870 --> 17:07.550]  Goes on to say, I've emailed you a few picks.
[17:07.550 --> 17:09.310]  I did check out the emails and I did reply.
[17:09.310 --> 17:12.190]  I'm sorry for holding the email paper in front of the camera.
[17:12.190 --> 17:12.550]  That's rude.
[17:12.550 --> 17:13.430]  I wasn't paying any attention.
[17:13.430 --> 17:14.990]  If you're watching the video, I do apologize.
[17:15.270 --> 17:16.590]  Trying to be a better podcaster.
[17:17.030 --> 17:18.070]  I did check out the photos.
[17:18.070 --> 17:19.350]  I did reply with a video.
[17:19.350 --> 17:22.590]  I was kind enough to make a quick video of my space and show that to you.
[17:22.590 --> 17:23.430]  I hope it helped out.
[17:23.750 --> 17:26.950]  Then it says, mites are the only problem I haven't dealt with over the years.
[17:26.950 --> 17:32.630]  And I don't want to have to, uh, the way to not deal with mites is to have a solid
[17:32.630 --> 17:36.270]  integrated pest management system, have some sort of security so that those mites
[17:36.270 --> 17:40.590]  cannot arrive, don't allow them to even show their faces, either sprays or
[17:40.590 --> 17:42.590]  predators, however you choose to do it.
[17:43.430 --> 17:47.070]  In your message, uh, you were concerned that maybe they'll come in the cracks.
[17:47.070 --> 17:48.990]  It feels like maybe they'll come in those little holes where
[17:48.990 --> 17:50.230]  you just hung up that board.
[17:50.590 --> 17:53.270]  They're going to come in through the miniature cracks in the walls in your
[17:53.270 --> 17:55.630]  house anyway, if they're there, they're coming in.
[17:55.990 --> 17:58.590]  Uh, just make sure you've got a pest management system.
[17:58.990 --> 18:02.790]  Um, another good point you bring up is also with a unit on the floor, the hoses
[18:02.790 --> 18:04.870]  don't quite reach without being fully stretched.
[18:05.190 --> 18:08.030]  Will I need additional six inch venting or five inch?
[18:08.030 --> 18:10.110]  They're using five inch on that one different model than I've got.
[18:10.390 --> 18:12.550]  So the hoses are working properly, or would it be better to
[18:12.550 --> 18:14.350]  prop it up on cement blocks?
[18:14.630 --> 18:15.870]  That is a very good question.
[18:15.910 --> 18:20.790]  I love the way you think I've got mine raised up on three cinder blocks.
[18:20.990 --> 18:22.110]  I've got it up kind of high.
[18:22.270 --> 18:26.550]  The heat blows at the canopy or the air, the cool blows at the canopy of my plants
[18:26.550 --> 18:27.470]  right across the top.
[18:27.470 --> 18:29.310]  It kind of goes between the lights and the canopy.
[18:29.590 --> 18:30.750]  That's where the hottest part is.
[18:31.030 --> 18:32.990]  It just pushes that heat right away.
[18:33.190 --> 18:36.750]  Also up on the buckets, I am allowed to, these air conditioners will
[18:36.750 --> 18:38.630]  create condensation and runoff.
[18:38.630 --> 18:39.750]  There's a drain in the back.
[18:39.950 --> 18:40.990]  It will pee a little bit.
[18:41.030 --> 18:45.630]  Occasionally run that tube into a bucket between those cinder blocks that you've
[18:45.630 --> 18:47.270]  got it raised up on or however you raise it.
[18:47.270 --> 18:48.750]  Cinder blocks are my recommendation.
[18:49.070 --> 18:52.310]  It probably weighs about 130 pounds to be careful lifting it up.
[18:52.310 --> 18:53.910]  Make sure it doesn't roll off of there.
[18:54.470 --> 18:57.550]  I put duct tape flaps on the wheels.
[18:58.150 --> 19:01.790]  The cooler is sitting on four cinder blocks.
[19:01.870 --> 19:03.110]  Is it four or is it two?
[19:04.230 --> 19:04.630]  It's two.
[19:04.630 --> 19:05.950]  There's, it's only this wide.
[19:05.950 --> 19:09.230]  So there's two cinder blocks are stacked up three high, but I took just little
[19:09.230 --> 19:12.950]  mounds, I made speed bumps out of duct tape on the cinder blocks so that the
[19:13.110 --> 19:15.470]  thing cannot roll also the wheels pivot.
[19:15.630 --> 19:18.710]  So I turned it toward the wheels are facing different directions so that it
[19:18.710 --> 19:20.310]  doesn't have an easy way to turn.
[19:20.550 --> 19:21.230]  Just be safe.
[19:21.230 --> 19:21.710]  Be careful.
[19:21.710 --> 19:23.150]  It weighs 130 pounds.
[19:23.430 --> 19:24.350]  It could fall on you.
[19:24.350 --> 19:25.510]  It could fall on your plants.
[19:25.790 --> 19:29.430]  When it falls, that ducting that it's attached to is going to yank the window
[19:29.430 --> 19:32.830]  cover off and now everybody can see right into your grow room if the lights are on.
[19:32.830 --> 19:35.590]  If it's hot outside, everyone's seeing your grow lights.
[19:35.710 --> 19:36.870]  They're seeing your grow room.
[19:37.110 --> 19:38.590]  Make sure that fucking thing doesn't fall.
[19:38.630 --> 19:40.190]  But yes, do raise it up off the ground.
[19:40.190 --> 19:41.550]  It's going to make condensation.
[19:41.870 --> 19:43.430]  Hopefully it came with the drain tube.
[19:43.430 --> 19:44.990]  If not, it's got a little spout in the back.
[19:45.310 --> 19:46.550]  Lift up the cover on that.
[19:46.950 --> 19:48.470]  I just leave it uncovered all the time.
[19:48.470 --> 19:50.190]  Mine's got a tube that hangs into a bucket.
[19:50.670 --> 19:54.150]  Uh, fills up about five gallons, maybe every week or so.
[19:54.150 --> 19:56.590]  I never let it get full cause I can see it when I go in the room.
[19:57.190 --> 19:58.350]  Just dump it occasionally.
[19:58.990 --> 20:01.710]  A lot of people say you can use that water to water your plants.
[20:01.750 --> 20:02.870]  I don't like that.
[20:03.270 --> 20:04.310]  There could be shit in there.
[20:04.310 --> 20:06.950]  There could not, but there could be shit in there.
[20:07.310 --> 20:09.150]  Let's see if there's any more to this message.
[20:09.150 --> 20:12.110]  It says again, thanks for all you do Rasta Jeff.
[20:12.310 --> 20:14.070]  Karen, thank you for noticing.
[20:14.070 --> 20:14.990]  Thank you for the support.
[20:14.990 --> 20:17.310]  You've been helping me out on Patreon for quite a while.
[20:17.310 --> 20:18.550]  It does not go unnoticed.
[20:18.830 --> 20:22.030]  That's part of why your message got moved directly to the top of the list.
[20:22.270 --> 20:23.470]  Also, it was perfectly timed.
[20:23.470 --> 20:24.630]  It's hot as shit outside.
[20:24.910 --> 20:25.550]  I'm sweating.
[20:25.550 --> 20:28.230]  Everybody's rubbing their forehead all day today, everywhere I was.
[20:28.390 --> 20:29.350]  So perfect timing.
[20:29.630 --> 20:33.750]  It also says I popped some lemon Jeffrey and orange chasm seeds that you were kind
[20:33.750 --> 20:35.950]  enough to get to me when seeds here now was sold out.
[20:35.950 --> 20:36.470]  Allegedly.
[20:36.470 --> 20:37.390]  I'm not sure what you're saying.
[20:37.750 --> 20:39.230]  Uh, they look gorgeous.
[20:39.630 --> 20:40.190]  Uh, it's so cool.
[20:40.190 --> 20:43.230]  You're doing operation grow with the orange chasm.
[20:43.590 --> 20:47.670]  Uh, she is referring to operation grow, which is sponsored by IRI
[20:47.670 --> 20:52.190]  genetics, PL grow systems, new millennium nutrients, auto pots, and possibly
[20:52.190 --> 20:56.110]  another company, which I have forgotten, but we are all, they are all growing
[20:56.230 --> 21:00.550]  orange chasm and they are all using a PL grow minder unit to monitor the room.
[21:00.590 --> 21:04.830]  Everybody has an auto pot system to feed the plants and everybody got a box of new
[21:04.830 --> 21:07.510]  millennium to provide nutrition to the plants.
[21:07.510 --> 21:09.350]  And we are all meeting every Saturday.
[21:09.670 --> 21:11.790]  It is 2 PM mountain time.
[21:11.990 --> 21:13.150]  Uh, for me, I'm in mountain time.
[21:13.150 --> 21:15.030]  I don't know where you are, but convert that.
[21:15.710 --> 21:18.310]  Uh, whatever time it is, wherever you are, join us on YouTube.
[21:18.510 --> 21:19.590]  I go on at 2 PM.
[21:19.590 --> 21:21.270]  We talk about operation grow.
[21:21.510 --> 21:23.150]  This time we were growing orange chasm.
[21:23.150 --> 21:25.550]  There are six growers that all started at the same time.
[21:25.870 --> 21:27.510]  They're all on the same phase of growth.
[21:27.510 --> 21:29.790]  We flipped into flower on Saturday.
[21:29.790 --> 21:33.950]  So the coming Saturday will be the first grow report of the
[21:33.950 --> 21:35.110]  plants being into flower.
[21:35.350 --> 21:37.870]  Uh, Karen, I'm glad you were following along with that.
[21:37.870 --> 21:39.470]  I hope you're learning a lot about the plant.
[21:39.470 --> 21:43.110]  There was a lot of interesting information on the last couple of episodes and I love
[21:43.110 --> 21:45.070]  your, uh, your enthusiasm about growing.
[21:45.070 --> 21:46.430]  So keep it up, stick around, please.
[21:46.430 --> 21:48.350]  And if you've got more questions, please reach out.
[21:48.670 --> 21:49.750]  I would love to hear from you.
[21:49.990 --> 21:53.230]  It says, uh, I've been learning about her alongside the boys and I'm
[21:53.230 --> 21:55.030]  stoked to watch her grow.
[21:55.310 --> 21:56.510]  I'm excited that you're joining us.
[21:56.510 --> 21:59.630]  It's good to know that more people from this show are watching that show.
[21:59.630 --> 22:00.230]  So thank you.
[22:00.430 --> 22:03.190]  You guys, I invite you come check out operation grow.
[22:03.430 --> 22:08.030]  It may be operation grow 2019 because that is when it started, but don't get fooled.
[22:08.070 --> 22:09.750]  We are still up to date and staying current.
[22:10.030 --> 22:10.270]  All right.
[22:10.270 --> 22:12.070]  This says, feel free to use my name.
[22:12.070 --> 22:15.830]  If you want to include it on an episode, I'm a medical caregiver out here and I
[22:15.830 --> 22:19.310]  am proud in or out and proud in Michigan.
[22:19.310 --> 22:21.150]  Big shout out to all my friends out there in Michigan.
[22:21.150 --> 22:22.150]  Michigan is killing it.
[22:22.510 --> 22:24.430]  Uh, it's kind of the wild, wild West out there.
[22:24.430 --> 22:25.430]  And I like that style.
[22:25.590 --> 22:27.150]  Karen, you keep it up, keep crushing it.
[22:27.350 --> 22:30.230]  And if you've got more girl questions, please send them right.
[22:30.350 --> 22:31.550]  My direction.
[22:32.150 --> 22:32.310]  All right.
[22:32.310 --> 22:34.590]  I'm going to keep moving because I do have another great message.
[22:34.590 --> 22:36.590]  This one also is about air conditioning.
[22:36.910 --> 22:43.950]  This one comes from, um, uh, monsoon moon for 20 shout out to monsoon moon for 20.
[22:44.750 --> 22:48.750]  The message goes a little bit like a, this, it says, Hey, Ross to Jeff.
[22:48.750 --> 22:52.350]  I'm a long time listener and I love your show because it gets me through the day
[22:52.350 --> 22:54.550]  and teaches me things at the same time.
[22:54.990 --> 22:55.470]  Perfect.
[22:55.470 --> 22:57.350]  You have found the catch, bro.
[22:57.470 --> 22:58.270]  You are learning.
[22:58.310 --> 22:59.030]  You're laughing.
[22:59.190 --> 23:01.590]  You're getting a good time and it's getting you through the day.
[23:01.790 --> 23:04.350]  You're at the office, you're in the truck, you're doing whatever you're doing, but
[23:04.350 --> 23:05.590]  you're not thinking about that crap.
[23:05.590 --> 23:07.790]  Cause I'm teaching you something and you're having fun.
[23:07.790 --> 23:09.510]  So thank you for noticing, bro.
[23:09.790 --> 23:13.350]  It goes on to say, I'm just wondering if you can give me some advice on my
[23:13.350 --> 23:15.910]  mini split ACs for my grow space.
[23:16.430 --> 23:18.750]  I've got to, uh, speak up before we get too far.
[23:18.790 --> 23:20.350]  I am not an HVAC technician.
[23:20.350 --> 23:22.150]  Everything I say is bro science.
[23:22.430 --> 23:24.310]  Uh, this is all from what I've seen and heard.
[23:24.710 --> 23:28.350]  Uh, I am not a pro in this department, but we're going to get through this together.
[23:28.670 --> 23:31.030]  It says I have framed up a veg and flower room.
[23:31.030 --> 23:32.510]  My flower room is five by five.
[23:32.750 --> 23:36.670]  They're in a normal bedroom and I have an active air take an active intake
[23:36.670 --> 23:38.510]  and exhaust in both of my rooms.
[23:38.750 --> 23:42.030]  So you've got active in and active out on both of them.
[23:42.150 --> 23:46.150]  The intakes pull air from the room outside the grow area and the exhaust
[23:46.190 --> 23:48.510]  go to an empty space under the house.
[23:48.990 --> 23:49.390]  All right.
[23:49.390 --> 23:53.550]  So you're pulling from the, uh, outside the grow area and then it's going through
[23:53.550 --> 23:55.550]  the grow space and then under the house.
[23:56.110 --> 23:59.110]  I'm really only worried about cooling the flower room.
[23:59.590 --> 24:02.110]  Uh, then it says the bedroom doesn't matter so much.
[24:02.110 --> 24:02.790]  Yes, it does.
[24:02.790 --> 24:04.310]  That's the first correction I'm going to make.
[24:04.670 --> 24:08.310]  I don't know how hot your flower room, your bedroom is getting, but so many
[24:08.310 --> 24:12.390]  people overlook the importance of building a quality bedroom that their
[24:12.390 --> 24:14.910]  grow is not as successful as it could be.
[24:15.550 --> 24:21.670]  Your veg room is equally as important, if not more important than your flowering
[24:21.670 --> 24:26.190]  room without a proper veg cycle, your plants will be weak and spindly and not
[24:26.190 --> 24:28.070]  prepared for a proper flowering cycle.
[24:28.310 --> 24:32.030]  I'm not saying that monsoon moon 420 is doing anything wrong.
[24:32.190 --> 24:33.430]  They may have a perfect setup.
[24:33.430 --> 24:34.910]  They don't need to make any adjustments.
[24:34.910 --> 24:39.030]  I want to make sure that everybody knows that veg is very important.
[24:39.670 --> 24:43.470]  I often see people invest a lot of money in the flower room.
[24:43.750 --> 24:45.390]  And then I'm like, cool, let me see your veg space.
[24:45.390 --> 24:46.870]  I'm like, Oh, I bought a five by five tent.
[24:47.230 --> 24:50.590]  And I'm like, so you spent thousands of dollars on this fancy flower room
[24:50.870 --> 24:53.630]  and you're going to start everything off in a five by five tent.
[24:54.150 --> 24:54.630]  Okay.
[24:55.190 --> 24:56.550]  That's, that's cool.
[24:56.550 --> 24:59.150]  But I think you should have veg is the foundation.
[24:59.190 --> 25:00.030]  That is the start.
[25:00.230 --> 25:03.510]  You want the best lights, the best ventilation, the best CO2.
[25:03.510 --> 25:05.190]  You want all of the best in veg.
[25:05.510 --> 25:06.270]  That's like training.
[25:06.510 --> 25:08.990]  You want to train the best you can before you go into battle
[25:08.990 --> 25:10.390]  and battle is the flower phase.
[25:10.750 --> 25:11.830]  Um, I want them tough.
[25:11.830 --> 25:12.550]  I want them strong.
[25:12.550 --> 25:13.550]  I want them prepared.
[25:13.550 --> 25:18.030]  I want them to be ready to flower and give me what I need before I put them into flower.
[25:18.030 --> 25:23.150]  So I think veg is just as important and matters as much, if not more.
[25:23.550 --> 25:26.070]  Uh, so I don't know if you've already got a dialed in veg space and it
[25:26.070 --> 25:29.550]  doesn't matter that you upgrade it, but I want to make sure that you
[25:29.550 --> 25:31.270]  understand it does matter as much.
[25:31.270 --> 25:32.350]  Now, let me keep going.
[25:32.350 --> 25:36.910]  It says, do you think it's better to have the head of the AC inside the flower room
[25:36.950 --> 25:40.350]  or outside of the flower room blowing near an intake?
[25:41.190 --> 25:41.470]  All right.
[25:41.470 --> 25:45.270]  So you've got your veg space and your flower space inside of this bedroom.
[25:46.270 --> 25:47.870]  You're bringing air into the tents.
[25:48.310 --> 25:53.470]  If you put the head of your mini split inside the room, you cannot have
[25:53.470 --> 25:57.790]  different temperatures in your veg tent and in your flowering tent because
[25:57.790 --> 26:00.870]  you're cooling the room and sucking that air into the tents.
[26:01.190 --> 26:05.270]  So whatever temperature you get the room in the middle, we call that a lung room.
[26:05.270 --> 26:10.310]  Whatever that lung room is temperature to, that's what temperature is going to go
[26:10.310 --> 26:12.950]  into your flower and your veg spaces.
[26:13.430 --> 26:18.310]  If you put the head of your mini split inside the flower space, you can dial
[26:18.310 --> 26:20.270]  in the temperature in the flower room.
[26:20.670 --> 26:21.670]  You've got a mini split.
[26:21.670 --> 26:22.990]  You should have two heads, right?
[26:22.990 --> 26:24.310]  Can't you put one in each?
[26:24.310 --> 26:25.710]  I'm not sure what unit you bought.
[26:25.950 --> 26:27.270]  Many of them have two heads.
[26:27.270 --> 26:29.510]  That's why it's a split split over here, split it over here.
[26:29.990 --> 26:30.630]  Or is it a split?
[26:30.630 --> 26:32.990]  Cause the heads outside are in here and the units outside.
[26:32.990 --> 26:33.430]  I don't know.
[26:33.630 --> 26:38.550]  Like I said, bro, not an HVAC guy, but, um, so that is your main thing to think about.
[26:38.550 --> 26:41.990]  Do you want to climate control the room and move that air into both of the tents?
[26:41.990 --> 26:45.430]  Or do you want the flowering room to get the focus of the air conditioner?
[26:46.190 --> 26:50.030]  Then it goes on to say, if I go ahead and install it straight into the flower room,
[26:50.030 --> 26:53.270]  will I still need to use my intake or exhausts?
[26:53.910 --> 26:59.310]  Um, yes, because you are not replacing the fresh air, the CO2, the humidity.
[26:59.390 --> 27:00.870]  There's no airflow because of that.
[27:00.870 --> 27:05.390]  You still need, unless you seal up the room and supplement CO2, you do still
[27:05.390 --> 27:09.670]  need exhaust and intake because you'll stifle the CO2 and oxygen in that room.
[27:10.510 --> 27:13.790]  If you're running CO2 and you've got enough CO2 to supplement, to keep those
[27:13.790 --> 27:17.910]  plants happy, you can seal it up and not use those intakes, but if you don't have
[27:17.910 --> 27:21.710]  supplemental CO2 in there, and I mean like 14 to 1600 PPMs, if you're not
[27:21.710 --> 27:26.150]  supplementing high, don't seal it up and do keep using the intakes and outs.
[27:26.630 --> 27:30.270]  Uh, what I need to exhaust the smell out of the room at certain intervals.
[27:31.550 --> 27:35.910]  I hope you've got a carbon filter hooked up to, uh, your outtakes, all of your
[27:35.910 --> 27:39.310]  outtakes and your exhausts, even if they're going under the house, I would
[27:39.310 --> 27:43.910]  still put a carbon filter on all of your outtakes and just run those exhausts.
[27:43.910 --> 27:46.310]  24 hours a day to keep that air moving.
[27:46.590 --> 27:51.310]  You may be able to turn off the fans on the intake because that outtake, the
[27:51.310 --> 27:54.150]  exhaust will passively pull air in through the intakes.
[27:54.150 --> 27:56.150]  You'll get enough replacement air through displacement.
[27:56.470 --> 27:56.990]  Hopefully.
[27:57.710 --> 28:01.030]  I don't know your space, but most of the time, typically that's what will happen.
[28:01.350 --> 28:04.190]  So make sure you're running your carbon filter on your
[28:04.190 --> 28:05.750]  exhaust to keep that air out of there.
[28:05.990 --> 28:07.190]  I think I covered most of that.
[28:07.190 --> 28:12.470]  Then the last part of the question says also, um, what material could I use to
[28:12.470 --> 28:15.190]  make a good seal on the doors to my room?
[28:15.470 --> 28:17.030]  I recommend weather stripping dude.
[28:17.310 --> 28:21.110]  Um, or the flaps that they sell use that flap that goes on the bottom to cover
[28:21.110 --> 28:23.150]  the light, lower that as low as you can.
[28:23.350 --> 28:26.950]  Then also use weather stripping on the inside of the door to where it
[28:26.950 --> 28:28.510]  seals real tight up against the wall.
[28:28.870 --> 28:30.230]  Then they sell other flaps.
[28:30.350 --> 28:32.310]  Um, I can't remember what they're called.
[28:32.310 --> 28:33.390]  They're near the weather stripping.
[28:33.390 --> 28:37.350]  If you go to your local hardware store, there's, they're like six foot sections
[28:37.350 --> 28:38.870]  of weather stripping that'll screw in.
[28:39.030 --> 28:41.030]  So the door will close and fit right up against that.
[28:41.030 --> 28:43.790]  You put this one stripping on one side, you put this shit on the other side
[28:43.790 --> 28:45.110]  and they fit up perfectly together.
[28:45.590 --> 28:46.750]  That's a little bit overkill.
[28:46.750 --> 28:49.870]  In my opinion, the weather stripping does very well in any facility,
[28:49.870 --> 28:51.070]  any grow that I've worked in.
[28:51.590 --> 28:53.070]  So that is a great question.
[28:53.430 --> 28:56.470]  Uh, if you want to cool that flower room, drop the head in the flower room.
[28:56.470 --> 29:00.070]  If you want to cool both rooms, uh, put the head of the air
[29:00.070 --> 29:01.270]  conditioner in the middle.
[29:01.870 --> 29:02.670]  Where else are we?
[29:02.670 --> 29:05.390]  Use those exhausts with carbon filters.
[29:05.430 --> 29:09.310]  If you're not running CO2, you may not need to use the intake fans,
[29:09.310 --> 29:12.510]  but you can, if you want to think about the amount of air you're putting in and
[29:12.510 --> 29:15.030]  the amount of air you're taking out, are the fans the same size?
[29:15.430 --> 29:17.790]  Um, do you have any sort of displacement?
[29:17.790 --> 29:19.950]  Do you want negative or positive pressure in that room?
[29:19.950 --> 29:22.350]  Those are things to think about things you can adjust at this point.
[29:22.910 --> 29:27.350]  And then smell always use a carbon filter and put those, uh,
[29:27.350 --> 29:29.270]  weather stripping on your door.
[29:29.710 --> 29:29.910]  All right.
[29:29.910 --> 29:30.870]  How long have we been going?
[29:30.870 --> 29:31.750]  Just about 30 minutes.
[29:31.750 --> 29:33.470]  I think I didn't write down the start time.
[29:33.790 --> 29:34.550]  We're going to keep going.
[29:34.550 --> 29:35.830]  I do have a couple of more messages.
[29:35.830 --> 29:36.710]  These can be quick.
[29:37.470 --> 29:40.310]  This one came from somebody who we don't need to mention their name.
[29:40.310 --> 29:42.630]  They know who they are, but it says, what's up, dude.
[29:42.630 --> 29:45.550]  I'm coming to you for some advice, bro.
[29:45.910 --> 29:48.910]  Um, we spoke last a little bit about getting in the industry.
[29:49.270 --> 29:51.830]  Well, I'm sure you get hundreds of emails from growers like this, but I
[29:51.830 --> 29:53.470]  hope you consider this one different.
[29:53.790 --> 29:56.630]  Anyway, I've been growing cannabis for close to two years consistently.
[29:57.070 --> 30:01.230]  I've been for off and on a little bit longer due to being in an area where it
[30:01.270 --> 30:05.550]  is illegal to grow, but decriminalization for possession puts me at risk for daily,
[30:05.630 --> 30:08.230]  uh, daily for myself and my family kind of going fast.
[30:08.230 --> 30:09.030]  I want to get to the point.
[30:09.390 --> 30:11.870]  Um, so this person basically.
[30:12.350 --> 30:15.510]  They're in an area where they have commercial facilities, but
[30:15.510 --> 30:17.270]  they cannot afford licensing.
[30:17.550 --> 30:19.590]  And they kind of want to get to growing legally.
[30:19.590 --> 30:23.430]  It says, I wanted to get a backstory to you, but then it says, do you know of any
[30:23.430 --> 30:25.430]  facilities that are looking to hire?
[30:25.430 --> 30:28.950]  My wife and I have already discussed, and she's fine with me having to travel.
[30:29.270 --> 30:32.910]  If you know of someone or anybody who needs help or wants help trimming,
[30:32.910 --> 30:35.470]  propagating, transplanting should all even sweep the floors.
[30:35.910 --> 30:41.630]  Uh, basically this person is looking for a job here in Colorado and I hate to be
[30:41.630 --> 30:45.630]  this guy, but there aren't any cannabis jobs.
[30:46.550 --> 30:47.030]  Excuse me.
[30:47.030 --> 30:51.310]  There aren't any, there aren't many cannabis jobs popping open at this time.
[30:51.310 --> 30:52.630]  We're in the middle of a pandemic.
[30:52.630 --> 30:53.750]  We're in the middle of COVID.
[30:54.230 --> 30:57.190]  Most of the big facilities have gone on a skeleton crew.
[30:57.590 --> 30:59.950]  If they used to have six guys, now they got three.
[30:59.950 --> 31:02.150]  If they used to have 10 dudes, now they've got four.
[31:02.470 --> 31:05.670]  We've really minimized staff so that we're not getting as many people sick.
[31:06.070 --> 31:08.070]  Uh, the trim crew is minimized.
[31:08.110 --> 31:09.350]  Everybody is cut down.
[31:09.510 --> 31:11.230]  The stores are down to minimal staff.
[31:11.470 --> 31:14.830]  So unfortunately there is not much hiring happening in
[31:14.830 --> 31:16.550]  the Colorado cannabis industry.
[31:16.950 --> 31:20.190]  Hyrie genetics specifically is a very small operation.
[31:20.470 --> 31:22.910]  People seem to think, uh, and I love that we've built this
[31:22.910 --> 31:24.310]  illusion that it's a giant company.
[31:24.590 --> 31:25.910]  Hyrie genetics is me.
[31:26.070 --> 31:26.910]  It's just me.
[31:27.190 --> 31:30.070]  Sometimes I get a couple of people to help me package things.
[31:30.070 --> 31:33.390]  One or two people have volunteered and been paid to put seeds, the
[31:33.390 --> 31:35.390]  bubbles into the cardboard packs.
[31:35.390 --> 31:36.870]  But I touch all the seeds.
[31:36.870 --> 31:37.990]  I do all the packaging.
[31:38.150 --> 31:39.230]  I get very minimal help.
[31:39.230 --> 31:41.790]  I have some shipping help and some packaging help, but that's about it.
[31:41.790 --> 31:42.590]  Shout out to my helpers.
[31:42.590 --> 31:43.470]  You guys know who you are.
[31:43.830 --> 31:47.830]  Not ignoring you, but 99.9% of Hyrie genetics is me.
[31:47.830 --> 31:49.830]  So I don't need too much more help.
[31:49.830 --> 31:52.710]  I don't, I couldn't hire anybody to give them a reliable
[31:52.710 --> 31:54.030]  income or anything like that.
[31:54.030 --> 31:56.790]  So unfortunately I don't have any good advice for you on the
[31:56.790 --> 31:58.310]  hiring part, I do need a quick drink.
[31:58.310 --> 31:59.110]  My throat is parched.
[31:59.110 --> 32:00.270]  That's why I was stuttering a moment ago.
[32:00.470 --> 32:01.630]  Let me take a drink and I'll keep going.
[32:06.300 --> 32:06.540]  All right.
[32:06.860 --> 32:08.300]  Now I'm ready for another long ramble.
[32:09.180 --> 32:13.900]  Um, you said that there are producers in your area getting licenses.
[32:14.540 --> 32:17.340]  My suggestion is you said you cannot come up with the
[32:17.340 --> 32:18.540]  money to get your own license.
[32:18.540 --> 32:20.580]  Go to one of those people and apply there.
[32:20.980 --> 32:23.380]  Uh, get a good background in a commercial cultivation
[32:23.380 --> 32:24.740]  area where you already are.
[32:24.940 --> 32:27.420]  You've got a family, you've got a lady, you've got a baby on the way.
[32:27.580 --> 32:31.580]  Let's not uproot you for a hopeful career when maybe you can find a career
[32:31.580 --> 32:33.060]  right there in your own backyard.
[32:33.060 --> 32:33.900]  That's my advice.
[32:34.180 --> 32:36.820]  Go to one of those facilities that is producing, go to the
[32:36.820 --> 32:38.860]  dispensaries, go everywhere and apply.
[32:38.860 --> 32:42.100]  All you have to do is make a good resume, make a resume, just like you
[32:42.100 --> 32:43.700]  would apply for any other position.
[32:43.700 --> 32:46.420]  Also add that you were a passionate cannabis cultivator.
[32:46.780 --> 32:50.660]  Be professional, be on time, speak well, uh, dress decently.
[32:50.660 --> 32:51.660]  It is a grow position.
[32:51.660 --> 32:54.500]  It is a cultivation position, but you're not showing up to
[32:54.500 --> 32:55.700]  grow weed at the interview.
[32:55.740 --> 32:57.940]  You're showing up for an interview at the interview.
[32:57.940 --> 32:58.980]  Be prepared for that.
[32:59.420 --> 32:59.660]  All right.
[32:59.980 --> 33:02.100]  I think that is my rambly advice for that one.
[33:02.300 --> 33:03.940]  I wish I had more advice for you.
[33:04.140 --> 33:05.140]  Uh, you know who you are.
[33:05.260 --> 33:05.980]  Keep listening.
[33:05.980 --> 33:08.580]  If you've got more questions, please send them my way.
[33:08.820 --> 33:10.660]  And thanks for all of the Patreon support.
[33:11.380 --> 33:17.820]  This one, this last email from this show is very, a very, very important message.
[33:17.820 --> 33:20.060]  I've got to make sure to say this one nice and clearly.
[33:20.420 --> 33:26.180]  Uh, this one comes from our friend Thor and it says more white Mike.
[33:26.540 --> 33:28.060]  It's all it says more white Mike.
[33:28.060 --> 33:32.380]  So Mike, the people have requested your presence more white Mike, please.
[33:32.620 --> 33:32.820]  Mike.
[33:32.820 --> 33:33.740]  I love having you on the show.
[33:33.740 --> 33:35.500]  I've just been recording at random fucking times.
[33:35.500 --> 33:36.140]  You've been busy.
[33:36.380 --> 33:38.220]  You guys, we will get white Mike back on the show.
[33:38.220 --> 33:39.820]  I'll message him as soon as I'm done here.
[33:40.060 --> 33:42.700]  And I'll just say podcast with a question mark and we'll work it out.
[33:42.700 --> 33:43.220]  It'll happen.
[33:43.460 --> 33:44.140]  That's my bro.
[33:44.420 --> 33:46.540]  Uh, I apologize for not having him here for a while.
[33:46.700 --> 33:48.380]  Just been trying to get podcasts cranked out.
[33:48.820 --> 33:50.980]  Um, so I know you guys love white Mike.
[33:51.420 --> 33:54.700]  I've been trying to get better at being an interviewer.
[33:54.820 --> 33:56.820]  I'm not the best interviewer on a podcast.
[33:56.820 --> 33:58.060]  I feel like I run people over.
[33:58.060 --> 33:59.060]  Cause I've got a lot to say.
[33:59.060 --> 33:59.860]  I've got an agenda.
[33:59.860 --> 34:01.060]  I know how I want to say it.
[34:01.500 --> 34:02.300]  Uh, I just talk.
[34:02.620 --> 34:05.620]  So I'm trying to become a better interviewer, a better podcaster.
[34:05.620 --> 34:08.900]  I want to have more guests on my show via zoom people that
[34:08.900 --> 34:10.060]  aren't just my good friends.
[34:10.060 --> 34:11.340]  When Jesse comes over, it's easy.
[34:11.340 --> 34:12.660]  That's like hanging out with my bro.
[34:12.900 --> 34:15.060]  When Mike is here, that's just like hanging out with my bro.
[34:15.060 --> 34:17.940]  There's no work to that, but I want to be able to interview and hang out
[34:17.940 --> 34:19.380]  more comfortably with other people.
[34:20.020 --> 34:23.060]  The only way I can do that is by interviewing and hanging out
[34:23.300 --> 34:24.740]  comfortably with more people.
[34:24.980 --> 34:28.340]  So I would like your recommendations and suggestions who you would like
[34:28.340 --> 34:30.300]  to see me have on the podcast.
[34:30.300 --> 34:31.980]  Who do you think would make a great guest?
[34:32.220 --> 34:34.660]  Send me your recommendations via email or Twitter.
[34:34.860 --> 34:38.780]  The email address is grow from your heart at hotmail.com on Twitter.
[34:38.780 --> 34:40.820]  It's at GFYH podcast.
[34:41.100 --> 34:43.100]  Let me know who you would like to see on the show.
[34:43.460 --> 34:46.780]  Once I'm comfortable, I'll work my way up to more intimidating guests and
[34:46.780 --> 34:47.900]  we'll get some people on the show.
[34:48.140 --> 34:51.540]  Look forward to some guests on the podcast in the future.
[34:51.820 --> 34:52.060]  All right.
[34:52.060 --> 34:53.940]  That is all I've got for you for this episode.
[34:53.940 --> 34:55.180]  I want to thank you guys for hanging out.
