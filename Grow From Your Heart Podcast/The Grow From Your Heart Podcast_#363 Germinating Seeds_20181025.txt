[00:00.000 --> 00:04.480]  Welcome to the show, cannabis community. It's time for episode 363 of the Grow
[00:04.480 --> 00:08.880]  From Your Heart podcast. This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed
[00:08.880 --> 00:13.160]  Company. If you need new regular or feminized seeds for your garden, I highly
[00:13.160 --> 00:18.800]  recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company and you can find them at dankseed.store.
[00:18.800 --> 00:22.800]  I like to start the episodes off by letting you know what I'm smoking. I
[00:22.800 --> 00:27.200]  just finished the last dab of the Orange Skittles Ambrosia. That left a nice
[00:27.200 --> 00:31.280]  orange flavor in my mouth, gave me a nice head buzz. I followed that up with the
[00:31.280 --> 00:35.840]  last dab of the Bubble Jack Full Spectrum Extract from Fuego Extracts.
[00:35.840 --> 00:40.520]  That was delicious. The combo made me super rambly and gave me a lot of energy.
[00:40.520 --> 00:46.080]  So this will be a fun podcast. If you've been following along, you know I'm doing
[00:46.080 --> 00:50.680]  a long series of grow lessons. If you haven't been following along, I suggest
[00:50.680 --> 00:55.400]  you go back to episode 351 and start there and get caught up. That will give
[00:55.480 --> 00:59.760]  you a solid foundation on planning your grow and getting prepared for your new
[00:59.760 --> 01:04.120]  grow. If you've been following along, you know that we've selected our space, we've
[01:04.120 --> 01:07.760]  selected our equipment, we've done a lot of talk about genetics, and now this
[01:07.760 --> 01:11.840]  episode is going to be about sprouting our new seeds. Let's not waste too much
[01:11.840 --> 01:16.920]  time. Let's jump right into it. Seeds can be expensive depending on who you ordered
[01:16.920 --> 01:20.800]  them from, how many you bought, what kind you purchased. You may have spent a lot
[01:20.920 --> 01:25.560]  of money on seeds. Before you think about germinating your new seeds, I highly
[01:25.560 --> 01:31.160]  recommend you have your veg area ready to rock before you even think about
[01:31.160 --> 01:35.040]  starting your seeds. You're going to think, oh, I can just germinate these seeds
[01:35.040 --> 01:38.240]  and then I'll build up this veg room in the next couple of days. And then while
[01:38.240 --> 01:42.680]  they veg, I'll work on the flower room. Once you get plants going, you start time
[01:42.680 --> 01:47.120]  traveling. Things go so much more quickly than you anticipate. Things pop up,
[01:47.120 --> 01:50.520]  things get in your way, then you fall behind. Then those seeds you just paid a
[01:50.520 --> 01:54.200]  bunch of money for start growing funky, they get out of control, and you've got
[01:54.200 --> 01:58.200]  shitty plants to start with and you're frustrated from the beginning. So before
[01:58.200 --> 02:03.600]  you germinate your seeds, have your veg space prepared. That is my very first
[02:03.600 --> 02:07.560]  piece of advice to you that will save you a lot of frustration. Now my second
[02:07.560 --> 02:11.680]  piece of advice is to start with quality seed. Try to get your seeds from a
[02:11.680 --> 02:16.120]  reputable vendor and also from a reputable breeder. Don't fall for hype
[02:16.120 --> 02:20.280]  when you're shopping for seeds. Don't be sold. Try to find somebody with a good
[02:20.360 --> 02:24.560]  reputation, somebody that you have heard of, and also try to buy those seeds from
[02:24.560 --> 02:27.840]  a vendor with a good reputation, somebody that you have heard of, somebody that has
[02:27.840 --> 02:31.720]  a good relationship with the breeders. And if you're going to buy seeds online,
[02:31.720 --> 02:35.800]  I recommend you buy from a seed vendor in the United States. That way you don't
[02:35.800 --> 02:40.320]  have to risk customs. Of course I recommend the Helladank Seed Company. I
[02:40.320 --> 02:45.440]  also recommend the Seed Bazaar. And I can also vouch for Southern Oregon Seeds.
[02:45.440 --> 02:49.640]  Those are three quality seed vendors that I trust and respect and I work with
[02:49.640 --> 02:53.320]  them personally, so I know they will take good care of you. I'm not bashing
[02:53.320 --> 02:57.960]  any other seed company. I'm just saying I rely on these three companies. I have
[02:57.960 --> 03:01.640]  worked with them. I've got a relationship with them and I know they are rock-solid.
[03:01.640 --> 03:06.120]  So I recommend you start with a quality seed, something you know what the
[03:06.120 --> 03:09.920]  parents of that seed were, something you know where it came from. If you don't
[03:09.920 --> 03:15.080]  have access to fancy labeled expensive seeds, grow what you've got. In an ideal
[03:15.080 --> 03:18.680]  world, we would all go to the store and we look at the shelf and we'd say, you've
[03:18.680 --> 03:22.080]  got that strain, that was the best I've ever smoked, I want seeds of that. And I
[03:22.080 --> 03:26.280]  get that that's everybody's fantasy. That day is coming. Unfortunately we are not
[03:26.280 --> 03:30.160]  there yet for everybody. Some people are going to have to be resourceful. You may
[03:30.160 --> 03:33.440]  have bought a bag of weed 10 years ago at some random place and it had seeds
[03:33.440 --> 03:36.680]  in it. Now you're gonna have to grow those seeds. You never know what you're
[03:36.680 --> 03:40.040]  gonna get out of those seeds. You could find duds, you could find hermaphrodites,
[03:40.040 --> 03:44.920]  you may find the next magical strain in there. So grow what you've got. No matter
[03:44.920 --> 03:48.040]  where your seeds come from, whether they're regular, whether they're feminized
[03:48.040 --> 03:52.240]  seeds, pay close attention to them. Pay attention for males, pay attention for
[03:52.240 --> 03:55.880]  hermaphrodism, pay attention for problems. You will have to keep an eye out when
[03:55.880 --> 03:59.840]  you're growing from seed. Now if you've got a bag of seeds lying around and you
[03:59.840 --> 04:03.200]  don't know what any of them are, it's just a perhaps a sandwich bag or a
[04:03.200 --> 04:06.480]  little mason jar just stuffed with random seeds from bags of cannabis
[04:06.480 --> 04:10.440]  you've gone through over time and you can't decide what to grow, I go for the
[04:10.440 --> 04:14.600]  really healthy looking seeds. And by healthy I mean probably darker, probably
[04:14.600 --> 04:18.360]  bigger. A lot of people like the tiger stripes, that's always a good sign. Some
[04:18.360 --> 04:21.280]  seeds will not make tiger stripes no matter how long they grow, no matter how
[04:21.280 --> 04:24.560]  mature, no matter how healthy and strong they are, they just won't stripe up.
[04:24.560 --> 04:29.080]  That's just a genetic thing. I prefer the darker colored seeds, the harder seeds. I
[04:29.080 --> 04:31.800]  give them a little press on the table. I hope they don't crack. If they don't
[04:31.800 --> 04:34.920]  crack, that's probably a good seed. If it cracks, it obviously isn't gonna grow.
[04:34.920 --> 04:38.720]  That's a dead seed. A lot of people like a larger cannabis seed, but I have
[04:38.720 --> 04:43.680]  noticed that a lot of strains produce little tiny seeds. So sometimes a little
[04:43.800 --> 04:47.720]  tiny cannabis seed can produce a seriously potent plant. Don't judge it
[04:47.720 --> 04:52.000]  too much by the size, judge it more by the health of the seed. A lot of the
[04:52.000 --> 04:55.800]  grayer, light colored seeds will grow. I don't put those in my packs because
[04:55.800 --> 04:59.960]  people freak out. I grow those myself. But those lighter gray, the paler colored
[04:59.960 --> 05:03.400]  seeds, those will grow. The white seeds, those are more questionable. I don't
[05:03.400 --> 05:07.360]  think the white seeds do as well. The gray kind of silver sheeny seeds, those
[05:07.360 --> 05:11.520]  usually have a good takeoff. The darker ones, those take off quite quickly. And
[05:11.880 --> 05:15.280]  then of course you get those bigger, harder tiger stripe seeds. Those really
[05:15.360 --> 05:20.160]  have a lot of vigor and they take off really quickly for you. So seed health is
[05:20.160 --> 05:24.000]  important. Selecting healthy seeds. If you've got a big bag of seeds, try to
[05:24.000 --> 05:27.880]  select the healthiest looking beans out of that bag. Maybe a couple of them just
[05:27.880 --> 05:31.320]  call you. Maybe you've got a bag of a thousand seeds and two of them just go,
[05:31.320 --> 05:35.080]  hey bro, I'm the seeds you want to grow right now. Listen to that kind of stuff.
[05:35.400 --> 05:39.600]  That is usually accurate. All right, now we've got our veg space ready. We know
[05:39.600 --> 05:43.680]  what to look for in quality seeds. We've got some seeds on hand and it is time to
[05:43.680 --> 05:47.440]  germinate our seeds. What do I mean by germinate? That's just a fancy word for
[05:47.440 --> 05:52.040]  starting the seeds. We need to give them the proper conditions to make them start.
[05:52.040 --> 05:54.680]  We want to crack the seed open. We don't want to do it. We want it to happen
[05:54.680 --> 05:58.440]  naturally. We want the seed to crack itself open and we want a little tiny
[05:58.440 --> 06:03.440]  taproot to come fishing out and that is the start of life. In nature, those seeds
[06:03.440 --> 06:07.240]  would fall out of last year's bud. Winter would come. It would knock those seeds
[06:07.240 --> 06:11.560]  out. The buds would dry. The wind and the moisture would knock those seeds out of
[06:11.560 --> 06:14.760]  those buds. Those buds would fall into the ground. Winter would come and
[06:14.760 --> 06:18.640]  everything would be frozen for a little while. As the spring came and the winter
[06:18.640 --> 06:23.360]  frost or the winter moisture started moistening down into the soil, those seeds
[06:23.360 --> 06:28.080]  would begin to receive moisture and warmth from nature. That would trigger
[06:28.080 --> 06:31.760]  them to germinate. Then they would sprout up. They would find their way up, dig up
[06:31.760 --> 06:34.800]  out of the soil. They'd start seeing sun and they'd go, here I am. Then they would
[06:34.840 --> 06:38.400]  live and they would become little baby cannabis plants. Now with human
[06:38.400 --> 06:42.080]  involvement, what we've done, we have collected the seeds before they fall out
[06:42.080 --> 06:45.720]  of the buds. When I breed, I let the plants get done. I let the seeds get
[06:45.720 --> 06:49.280]  finished. I cut the plants down. I let them hang. They dry. Then I basically
[06:49.280 --> 06:52.520]  crumble up the buds and I manually remove the seeds. There are several
[06:52.520 --> 06:55.800]  methods of doing that. That's not important right now but that process
[06:55.800 --> 06:59.800]  happened. Then those seeds were passed on to you. Now you have to play the role of
[06:59.800 --> 07:03.840]  Mother Nature. We have to give these seeds the proper environment to trigger
[07:03.920 --> 07:08.640]  them to start their life. The two main things that are going to start our seeds
[07:08.640 --> 07:13.840]  are water and warmth. The main thing being water. Warmth is very secondary to that.
[07:13.840 --> 07:18.080]  Warmth will speed up the process and make them much happier. Now there are
[07:18.080 --> 07:22.760]  countless ways to start new seeds. I'm going to cover four or five methods here
[07:22.760 --> 07:27.240]  in this episode and I'm going to start with the method I use personally. I like
[07:27.240 --> 07:32.080]  the old-school paper towel technique. It is very simple. I get a plate out of the
[07:32.080 --> 07:35.640]  cupboard. Just a glass plate like you'd serve a meal on or make a sandwich. I
[07:35.640 --> 07:40.080]  also get a paper towel just like you'd use to clean up that meal or that
[07:40.080 --> 07:45.440]  sandwich. I fold the paper towel one time then I fold it again. Now you've just got
[07:45.440 --> 07:50.360]  a little rectangular paper towel. I set that paper towel onto the glass plate
[07:50.360 --> 07:54.680]  and then I get a bottle of water. I prefer bottled water for this because I
[07:54.680 --> 07:58.620]  don't want the chlorine or whatever else is in my tap water affecting my new
[07:58.620 --> 08:03.340]  seedlings. So I've got the folded paper towel sitting on the plate. I simply soak
[08:03.340 --> 08:09.380]  that paper towel with water. It will only hold so much. I simply saturate it. Then I
[08:09.380 --> 08:13.080]  tip the plate to the side to make sure all that excess water runs out of the
[08:13.080 --> 08:16.700]  paper towel and off of that plate. Just drain it right off into the sink. That
[08:16.700 --> 08:21.740]  water is gone. So now you've got a soggy paper towel in the middle of a plate. I
[08:21.740 --> 08:26.220]  place my seeds in the paper towel and then I gently fold it one more time. If
[08:26.420 --> 08:29.460]  you want to fold it another time you can and make a little tiny square that's
[08:29.460 --> 08:33.500]  fine but I think that first fold will be just fine. Just fold it up to where those
[08:33.500 --> 08:36.500]  seeds are in the middle and they're getting wet and they're not getting any
[08:36.500 --> 08:40.340]  light. The way that that wet paper towel works it'll kind of seal itself up so
[08:40.340 --> 08:43.780]  the seeds won't move around too much. There won't be any light in there. So
[08:43.780 --> 08:47.060]  you've got some seeds folded up in a wet paper towel and those are sitting on a
[08:47.060 --> 08:52.100]  plate. Now at this point you've got a couple of options. If you were able to
[08:52.260 --> 08:56.220]  pay attention to those seeds and be around them all the time and make sure
[08:56.220 --> 09:00.500]  they don't get dry you can just leave them on that plate and leave them
[09:00.500 --> 09:05.980]  exposed. If it's not too hot or not too cold in your area they will sprout just
[09:05.980 --> 09:12.020]  fine just left sitting like that. If you want to slow down the amount of moisture
[09:12.020 --> 09:15.780]  leaving that paper towel and try to keep it moist a little bit longer without
[09:15.780 --> 09:19.820]  having to pay so much attention just set another plate over it. Flip the plate
[09:19.820 --> 09:23.260]  upside down and set it on top of the first plate just like you do if you had
[09:23.260 --> 09:26.180]  a sandwich in there and you didn't want anything to get to the sandwich so you
[09:26.180 --> 09:30.060]  just got two plates with your little folded up paper towel in there. You have
[09:30.060 --> 09:35.740]  to keep it moist at all times. Do not let it get dry. If you feel like you're going
[09:35.740 --> 09:40.060]  to get forgetful or if you need to go to work for an extended period of time and
[09:40.060 --> 09:44.500]  you cannot monitor the moisture of your new seedlings you can always set them in
[09:44.700 --> 09:50.140]  a baggie. Put your folded paper towel with the moisture in it in a baggie. This
[09:50.140 --> 09:53.820]  will give the moisture nowhere to go. It will be trapped inside that little
[09:53.820 --> 09:57.620]  environment. Just make sure you check on them as soon as you get home from work.
[09:57.620 --> 10:02.460]  If you leave that wet paper towel folded up in a baggie in a really warm spot for
[10:02.460 --> 10:07.100]  too long you can create a mildew situation. So make sure you pop that open
[10:07.100 --> 10:11.180]  get some fresh air in there and check on that as soon as you get home from work.
[10:11.220 --> 10:15.740]  So it sounds really easy because it is. You are folding a paper towel into a
[10:15.740 --> 10:19.940]  square. You're moistening it. You're letting the excess moisture run off. We
[10:19.940 --> 10:23.380]  set the seeds onto that moist paper towel and then we fold it to cover them
[10:23.380 --> 10:27.340]  up and then if you need to place another plate over it to slow down the dry time.
[10:27.340 --> 10:30.820]  If you're really forgetful and you're gonna be away for a while put it in a
[10:30.820 --> 10:36.660]  baggie to retain that moisture. Then set it somewhere semi-warm. Most of the time
[10:36.660 --> 10:40.780]  if you are comfortable in that area your seedlings are probably comfortable as
[10:40.860 --> 10:45.580]  well. Room temperature is acceptable for seedlings. A great spot for seedlings if
[10:45.580 --> 10:49.860]  you do not forget them is on top of the refrigerator. That temperature that
[10:49.860 --> 10:54.500]  happens right on top of the refrigerator is perfect for seedlings if you don't
[10:54.500 --> 10:58.100]  forget them. Put them in a baggie set them right on top. They should be ready
[10:58.100 --> 11:03.820]  in 12 to 24 maybe 36 hours. If you've got one of those old big TVs nobody's got
[11:03.820 --> 11:07.900]  those big old TVs anymore. They used to get warm on the back. That was a great
[11:07.980 --> 11:13.500]  spot to set seedlings in a baggie. It was on the back of the old Sony Trinitron 36
[11:13.500 --> 11:17.140]  inch TV where it got warm from playing video games all day. That would be the
[11:17.140 --> 11:21.580]  perfect temp for seedlings. Other than those subtle heat sources like the top
[11:21.580 --> 11:25.020]  of the fridge or the back of the TV I really don't recommend a heat mat for
[11:25.020 --> 11:29.580]  germinating new seeds or for your clones. I've seen more clones and seeds destroyed
[11:29.580 --> 11:33.660]  roasted and barbecued than I have ever seen assisted by one of those heat mats
[11:33.660 --> 11:37.340]  but I'm gonna talk about that more later in the episode I think so let's skip
[11:37.340 --> 11:41.380]  that for now and try to stay focused. Alright so we've got our seedlings they
[11:41.380 --> 11:44.780]  are folded up in a paper towel. We're keeping them moist. We don't want them
[11:44.780 --> 11:48.900]  soggy. We don't want them dripping all the time. We want to keep them moist and
[11:48.900 --> 11:52.100]  comfortable. So you've got them folded in the paper towel and you are checking on
[11:52.100 --> 11:55.900]  them every few hours if you were able. They're easy to check on. Just set your
[11:55.900 --> 11:58.780]  hand right on that paper towel. Don't crush the seeds. Just set your hand on
[11:58.780 --> 12:02.260]  there gently and if the paper towel is kind of cold kind of chilly they're
[12:02.260 --> 12:06.180]  probably wet enough. If you don't feel like it's wet enough moisten it up a
[12:06.180 --> 12:09.060]  little bit. Get your water bottle and just pour the water on there gently and
[12:09.060 --> 12:13.140]  then tip the plate over to where the excess water runs off into the sink and
[12:13.140 --> 12:16.540]  then you've got them moistened up for the rest of the day. They should only be
[12:16.540 --> 12:22.580]  in this paper towel for 12 to 24 maybe 36 or 48 hours before you see them
[12:22.580 --> 12:27.180]  starting to pop open. It will pop open on one side and a little white tail will
[12:27.180 --> 12:32.020]  start coming out. That is exactly what we are looking for. That is the start of
[12:32.020 --> 12:35.540]  life. That is a taproot. That is the beginning of everything. That little
[12:35.540 --> 12:39.180]  root is gonna dig down into the pot once we pot it and it's gonna dig down
[12:39.180 --> 12:42.540]  and start finding nutrients and that's gonna be the legs. That's gonna be the
[12:42.540 --> 12:46.180]  foundation and then it's gonna start shooting that seedling straight upward
[12:46.180 --> 12:48.860]  toward the light and then it's gonna shoot little leaves out of there and
[12:48.860 --> 12:51.540]  that little seedling will fall off and then you've got a little plant. So that
[12:51.540 --> 12:55.100]  is the start of everything happening right there and you get to see it
[12:55.100 --> 12:57.900]  because you've just got it right there in that paper towel. It's not buried
[12:57.900 --> 13:01.660]  under anything. So you can check on them. Check on them about 12 hours. If you
[13:01.660 --> 13:05.420]  don't see anything check on them in 24 hours. If you don't see anything go 30
[13:05.460 --> 13:08.620]  to 36. You're gonna get impatient after 24 hours. You'll be checking on them
[13:08.620 --> 13:11.940]  every four to six hours. Don't worry. Just keep checking. Don't forget about
[13:11.940 --> 13:15.700]  them. We only need maybe an eighth of an inch, maybe a quarter of an inch of that
[13:15.700 --> 13:20.740]  taproot to pop out before our seedlings are ready to put into soil but we will
[13:20.740 --> 13:25.380]  get to that. So I think I covered how to germinate seeds in a paper towel. You
[13:25.380 --> 13:29.420]  fold it, you wet it, you drain it, put the seeds in there, fold it again and then
[13:29.420 --> 13:35.060]  you keep an eye on it and keep it moist. Keep it slightly warm but don't roast it.
[13:35.180 --> 13:39.180]  If you think you might forget about your seedlings place the paper towel setup in
[13:39.180 --> 13:43.420]  a baggie and that will keep them moist until you open it. Once again don't
[13:43.420 --> 13:47.420]  forget about them. Make sure you check on them. Then when you unfold that paper
[13:47.420 --> 13:50.900]  towel and you've got little taproot sticking out that's when it's time to
[13:50.900 --> 13:54.660]  get ready to put them into your potting mix but we're gonna talk about that a
[13:54.660 --> 13:59.260]  little bit later. The only thing left to cover in this section is what if those
[13:59.260 --> 14:03.780]  seeds don't pop open after 48 hours. The only thing you can really do is wait a
[14:03.900 --> 14:07.500]  little bit longer. Maybe increase the heat. If you didn't already set them on
[14:07.500 --> 14:10.220]  the fridge maybe set them up there on top of the refrigerator where it's a
[14:10.220 --> 14:13.740]  little warmer. Maybe lessen the moisture. Maybe you've got them a little too wet.
[14:13.740 --> 14:17.900]  Maybe just keep that paper towel just damp. Maybe you've still got a little bit
[14:17.900 --> 14:22.020]  of a chance but if they haven't opened after 48 or 72 hours I would consider
[14:22.020 --> 14:26.940]  starting a fresh batch of seeds at that point. Now if it is really cold in your
[14:26.940 --> 14:31.060]  environment it will take longer for your seeds to germinate so expect that. If
[14:31.300 --> 14:34.180]  you're growing in the basement in Colorado you've got them sitting right
[14:34.180 --> 14:38.580]  on a concrete floor that's gonna take longer. Consider your environment. Like I
[14:38.580 --> 14:43.220]  said earlier the warmth will speed things up but that too can go wrong in
[14:43.220 --> 14:48.020]  excess so try to stay in the right area. Try to be about 70 to 85 degrees ish and
[14:48.020 --> 14:53.220]  you should be okay with rapid growth for your seeds. Now let's talk about our next
[14:53.220 --> 14:57.660]  method for sprouting our seeds. Our next method is using rapid rooters or root
[14:57.860 --> 15:02.980]  riots or whatever type of plugs are available in your area. Although I am not
[15:02.980 --> 15:07.860]  including rockwool cubes in this section. I don't like rockwool cubes for
[15:07.860 --> 15:10.940]  sprouting seeds. They do not work well for sprouting seeds. I would not
[15:10.940 --> 15:16.060]  recommend that. If it's what you've got do it similarly to what I recommend here
[15:16.060 --> 15:20.860]  with the rapid rooters but before you use your rockwool cubes make sure you
[15:20.860 --> 15:25.140]  clean them out and make sure you soak them in a pH balanced solution. Rinse
[15:25.220 --> 15:28.820]  them very well to get anything out of them then soak them either in clean
[15:28.820 --> 15:34.100]  water or a light nutrient solution that has been pH around 6. You don't want to
[15:34.100 --> 15:38.860]  use rockwool cubes without rinsing them and adjusting the pH. So this is all
[15:38.860 --> 15:44.420]  about rapid rooters or root riot plugs. When we start with these plugs we need
[15:44.420 --> 15:48.660]  to soak them. So I get a container based on the amount of plugs I'm going to use.
[15:48.660 --> 15:52.940]  I'm generally using a 5 gallon bucket. I think they're sold in a 50 pack so most
[15:52.940 --> 15:57.420]  of the time I just do all 50 and I either do 50 clones or 50 seedlings. I
[15:57.420 --> 16:01.500]  just use the whole package. You soak as many as you need. What I do is I get a
[16:01.500 --> 16:05.300]  container that will fit enough water to soak as many plugs as I'm gonna use. I
[16:05.300 --> 16:11.020]  adjust the pH to somewhere between 6 and 6.3. I usually place the rapid
[16:11.020 --> 16:14.660]  rooter plugs back into the rapid rooter tray. If you're not using the tray that's
[16:14.660 --> 16:17.340]  okay you don't need it but that's usually what I do. I put it right in the
[16:17.340 --> 16:23.460]  tray. Then I take a seed and I insert the seed into the rapid rooter plug. That
[16:23.460 --> 16:30.100]  seed goes pointy end down. If you look at your seeds it's got a round end and it's
[16:30.100 --> 16:34.620]  got a pointy end. It will be obvious when you look at it. The pointy end goes down.
[16:34.620 --> 16:39.260]  This is important because of the way that the seed grows. Pointy end down when
[16:39.260 --> 16:43.580]  you're putting it into a rapid rooter or any sort of a cube or if you're going
[16:43.660 --> 16:50.540]  directly into soil. Pointy end down. Also if you are going into a rapid rooter, if
[16:50.540 --> 16:54.500]  you're going into a root riot cube, if you're going into soil or if you're
[16:54.500 --> 16:58.340]  going against my advice and you're going directly into rockwool, it is always
[16:58.340 --> 17:03.100]  suggested that you plant your seeds about one knuckle deep. Just go just the
[17:03.100 --> 17:07.100]  tip of your finger just push it in until you press that first knuckle right that
[17:07.100 --> 17:10.460]  first bend in your finger. That's far enough. Stop pushing. That seedling is
[17:10.460 --> 17:14.060]  deep enough into the soil. It's deep enough into that cube. It will live
[17:14.060 --> 17:17.020]  there. It doesn't need to be buried way down in there. It stands a much better
[17:17.020 --> 17:21.900]  chance if it's just about knuckle deep is all you need to go. So after I've got
[17:21.900 --> 17:25.620]  all my seedlings planted and I've got all my cubes labeled, make sure you label
[17:25.620 --> 17:29.100]  each cube. If you're planting different strains, make sure you've got a way to
[17:29.100 --> 17:33.220]  label each cube so you know what you've got. Also label if you're doing more than
[17:33.220 --> 17:37.020]  one paper towel of seeds, make sure you label that paper towel some way. Most of
[17:37.020 --> 17:40.060]  you are just doing one pack of seeds or one strain but if you're doing multiple,
[17:40.140 --> 17:44.460]  please carefully label things. So we've got our seeds. They are in our Rapid
[17:44.460 --> 17:48.180]  Rooter cubes. They are carefully labeled. They are nice and moist. They are about
[17:48.180 --> 17:53.460]  knuckle deep down into the cube. Now I place them under a very light light. You
[17:53.460 --> 17:58.500]  don't need very powerful lighting for sprouting seeds. A really weak LED or a
[17:58.500 --> 18:03.300]  T5 kind of high up is plenty of lighting. A compact fluorescent is probably just
[18:03.300 --> 18:07.380]  enough light. You don't need to go extreme for a seedling. Just enough to
[18:07.420 --> 18:11.140]  encourage it to grow. Once it gets bigger, we do need light but right now we don't
[18:11.140 --> 18:15.260]  need ridiculous lighting for a small seedling. So place it under a light that
[18:15.260 --> 18:18.660]  will give it warmth and that will encourage it to grow. Now in about two or
[18:18.660 --> 18:21.980]  three days, maybe four or five days at the latest, you should see a little
[18:21.980 --> 18:26.180]  sprout pop out of your cube and you have now got a little seedling. Now that
[18:26.180 --> 18:30.500]  seedling can live in that little Rapid Rooter for several days but it's going
[18:30.500 --> 18:34.780]  to need a forever home. It's gonna need to go into either some soil or a hydro
[18:34.780 --> 18:39.980]  setup fairly soon. While it's in that Rapid Rooter, we need to keep it warm. We
[18:39.980 --> 18:44.100]  need to keep it somewhere between 70 and 85 degrees and we need to keep that root
[18:44.100 --> 18:48.900]  cube moist at all times. Once it dries up, that plant has no life source and it
[18:48.900 --> 18:53.300]  will die. So keep it moist and keep it warm and keep it under a light and then
[18:53.300 --> 18:57.860]  we need to think about getting it into a good potting mix or into a hydro system
[18:57.860 --> 19:02.920]  very soon so that it can thrive. So that is the basics of sprouting a seed in a
[19:02.920 --> 19:07.720]  Rapid Rooter or a Root Riot Cube or against my advice if you choose to use a
[19:07.720 --> 19:12.600]  Rockwool Cube, you would use a similar method. Basically soak it with the proper
[19:12.600 --> 19:17.560]  pH solution then press the seedling in, pointy end down and only go about a
[19:17.560 --> 19:22.600]  knuckle deep. Set it under a light and leave it alone for two or three days. You
[19:22.600 --> 19:27.200]  should see a little sprout pop up. If you don't see the sprout pop up, look in the
[19:27.200 --> 19:31.840]  little hole and see what you see. Sometimes the seedling simply gets caught
[19:31.840 --> 19:36.040]  and it's bent over and it can't pop itself up out of the root cube. That
[19:36.040 --> 19:42.880]  happens. You can carefully get a pair of tweezers or a chopstick and very gently
[19:42.880 --> 19:47.200]  encourage that plant to grow straight up. Don't pull it out of the seed casing.
[19:47.200 --> 19:51.760]  Don't pull it out of the cube. Maybe spread the hole of the cube open just a
[19:51.760 --> 19:55.720]  little bit and encourage it to pop out of there. It just needs to bend up and come
[19:55.720 --> 20:00.840]  out. You can probably guide it out if you're gentle. If it's close to doing it
[20:00.840 --> 20:04.400]  on its own, don't touch it. Just let it struggle and it will come out. If you
[20:04.400 --> 20:07.680]  feel like it's been long enough and you're getting impatient, just give it a
[20:07.680 --> 20:12.000]  little tug. It may pop out for you. Keep in mind you're risking killing this
[20:12.000 --> 20:15.440]  seedling if you get too rough. You're going to destroy it if you get too rough.
[20:15.440 --> 20:19.680]  But you've got a good chance. Just use your thumbs and spread that rapid rooter
[20:19.680 --> 20:23.720]  open just a little tiny bit and you may open it just enough for that seed to
[20:23.720 --> 20:27.200]  unbind itself and be able to pop straight up. It may just be stuck. It's
[20:27.200 --> 20:30.640]  trying to move up and the two leaves on the top, they just got stuck somewhere.
[20:30.680 --> 20:34.200]  That happens quite a bit and it'll just have to break itself free. So pay
[20:34.200 --> 20:38.200]  attention to that if it doesn't pop up in four or five days. If the others have
[20:38.200 --> 20:41.480]  popped up and you've got one that didn't pop up, look in there. That could be the
[20:41.480 --> 20:46.120]  issue with that one seedling. Now let's kind of touch on another method that is
[20:46.120 --> 20:50.400]  very similar to the rapid rooters and the root riot cubes, but it is also very
[20:50.400 --> 20:55.000]  different. This next method, you cannot put this into a hydro kit as simply as
[20:55.000 --> 20:59.120]  you could a rapid rooter or as simply as you could a seed from a paper towel. I'm
[20:59.280 --> 21:02.600]  sure some people have done it. I'm sure some people do it, but it's not as easy.
[21:02.600 --> 21:07.520]  It's much more challenging and it's not as logical. So let's talk about using
[21:07.640 --> 21:12.600]  Jiffy cubes. Jiffy cubes are great if you're going to go into soil, but like I
[21:12.600 --> 21:16.080]  said, you can't really use them going into a hydro system. I'm sure there's
[21:16.080 --> 21:19.840]  somebody doing it going to tell me I'm wrong, but it's not common. So a Jiffy
[21:19.840 --> 21:24.480]  cube, they're very similar to the rapid rooters, but they start off really small
[21:24.640 --> 21:28.800]  and you moisten them and they expand to the proper size. So you moisten them,
[21:28.840 --> 21:32.720]  they puff up, you squeeze the excess water out of them. Then from there, they
[21:32.720 --> 21:38.440]  work just like the rapid rooters or the root riot cubes. You place your seedling
[21:38.440 --> 21:42.920]  in there, pointy end down, you go about knuckle deep, and then you've got to
[21:42.920 --> 21:49.280]  keep your Jiffy cube moist, just like you do with your other cubes. Now, if
[21:49.280 --> 21:53.600]  you're using rapid rooters or root riots or Jiffy cubes, or if you're going
[21:53.600 --> 21:57.760]  against my advice still and using the rockwool cubes, make sure not to get
[21:57.760 --> 22:03.680]  them too moist for too long. If they're too moist, it will simply rot your
[22:03.680 --> 22:07.560]  seedlings. They will turn green, they will turn brown, they will fall over and
[22:07.560 --> 22:11.960]  die, or they will not even germinate at all. There's a big difference between
[22:11.960 --> 22:16.440]  being soaked and being wet and being moist. We want to soak them in the
[22:16.440 --> 22:20.760]  beginning, put the seeds in there when they are soaked, then just keep it wet
[22:20.880 --> 22:25.360]  from there. You can usually tell by looking at the rapid rooters how dry or
[22:25.360 --> 22:28.880]  wet they are. When they start getting that brown crusty color, they're too dry.
[22:28.880 --> 22:31.840]  When they start getting that sheen to them, they start showing a little silver,
[22:31.840 --> 22:35.400]  a little light reflection, that's just right. When they're really, really black,
[22:35.400 --> 22:41.160]  that's when they are soaked. So learn how to identify soaked and saturated and
[22:41.160 --> 22:45.160]  wet and moist and create a little scale for yourself. I did the one through five
[22:45.160 --> 22:48.640]  watering technique, maybe we need a similar thing for the rapid rooters. I
[22:48.680 --> 22:52.240]  kind of just did that. If they're totally soaked and black, that's a five. If
[22:52.240 --> 22:55.760]  they're dry and crispy, that's a one. We need to keep them about a three at all
[22:55.760 --> 22:59.080]  times, ladies and gentlemen. So there we go, one through five tech on rapid
[22:59.080 --> 23:03.320]  rooters, just like we did on watering normal plants. So now we know how to
[23:03.320 --> 23:07.560]  germinate seeds in paper towels. We know how to germinate seeds in rapid rooters.
[23:07.800 --> 23:12.360]  We kind of know how to do it in rockwool cubes. We know how to germinate seeds in
[23:12.360 --> 23:16.680]  jiffy cubes. It is just like doing it in the rapid rooters, you guys. You moisten
[23:16.800 --> 23:20.520]  them, they expand, you squeeze the excess water out of there, then you treat it
[23:20.640 --> 23:26.160]  just like a rapid rooter from there. Our next option is to plant our seedlings
[23:26.240 --> 23:30.000]  directly into soil. That's the way it happens in nature. Why wouldn't we do
[23:30.000 --> 23:33.760]  that in our personal garden? So let's talk a little bit about planting our
[23:33.760 --> 23:39.200]  seeds directly into soil or the medium we are going to use. If you plan to start
[23:39.200 --> 23:44.560]  your seedling in soil, I highly recommend you use a very small container. I would
[23:44.560 --> 23:50.320]  recommend a beer cup or something that size. There's no reason to have a tiny,
[23:50.320 --> 23:55.680]  tiny plant in a large container of soil. So my first recommendation is a small
[23:55.680 --> 24:01.200]  container with plenty of drainage. My second recommendation will be a good soil
[24:01.200 --> 24:05.920]  for starter plants, something with a lot of aeration and something with not too
[24:05.920 --> 24:09.760]  much nutrients added to it. Maybe something with some mycos or maybe some
[24:09.760 --> 24:14.320]  beneficial bacteria. That's good, but we don't need a lot of boosts for our
[24:14.320 --> 24:19.440]  little babies. So start with a small container of high quality starter soil.
[24:19.440 --> 24:24.720]  So I've got my container and I've got my starter soil. Now I moisten that soil
[24:24.720 --> 24:30.040]  before I put my seedlings into there. Just simply water that soil with a pH
[24:30.040 --> 24:35.120]  adjusted solution. You don't need nutrients, just water pH around 6 to 6.3.
[24:35.120 --> 24:39.440]  You should be just fine. Just water it on in, let it drain out. Once it's done
[24:39.440 --> 24:43.440]  draining, take your pointer finger and just make a little tiny hole. Just
[24:43.600 --> 24:47.520]  knuckle deep, just like I keep saying in the episode. I may name the episode that.
[24:47.520 --> 24:51.520]  Just go about one knuckle deep into the soil, then take your seedling and just
[24:51.520 --> 24:55.760]  set it right inside that hole. Then gently press the dirt right over that
[24:55.760 --> 24:58.640]  ceiling. Just real gently. You don't need to pack it down. Just cover up that
[24:58.640 --> 25:05.200]  ceiling and then just let it rest. And then within 24 to 48 to 36, maybe 72
[25:05.200 --> 25:08.720]  hours, you should see a little baby plant just popping up right out of there.
[25:08.720 --> 25:12.320]  You'll just see two little green leaves just popping right up out of that top
[25:12.320 --> 25:16.720]  soil. I like to keep my little baby plants in the beer cups under a T5 light.
[25:16.720 --> 25:19.920]  I try to keep the light kind of far when they're little. And then as they get
[25:19.920 --> 25:23.360]  bigger, I move the light a little bit closer. I try not to let the seedlings
[25:23.360 --> 25:26.960]  get too stretchy. If they start getting a little leggy, I move the light closer.
[25:26.960 --> 25:29.520]  I like to put a fan on them while they're little. That gives them a little
[25:29.520 --> 25:32.960]  strength, makes them a little more robust. So there are advantages and
[25:32.960 --> 25:38.000]  disadvantages to starting them in the beer cup. The advantage, they're already
[25:38.000 --> 25:41.760]  in their soil. You don't have to up-pot them. You don't have to transplant them.
[25:41.760 --> 25:46.080]  You don't have to do any damage to a little seedling. The disadvantage is
[25:46.080 --> 25:50.320]  sometimes you just completely lose a seedling in a beer cup filled with soil.
[25:50.320 --> 25:54.080]  Sometimes they just totally disappear. Sometimes they don't sprout at all.
[25:54.080 --> 25:58.320]  And sometimes you totally drown them by trying to water so much soil.
[25:58.320 --> 26:03.280]  So starting them in beer cups in soil is a little trickier, but it may be the only
[26:03.280 --> 26:08.080]  option for some people. Not everybody is able to order Rapid Rooters or Root Riot Cubes.
[26:08.080 --> 26:13.280]  Not everybody has access to a Rockwool Cube. And some people may just want to try it because
[26:13.280 --> 26:19.280]  that's the way it happens in nature. So that is a rundown of my basic methods of germinating seeds.
[26:19.280 --> 26:24.320]  Hopefully one of those methods works for you. Honestly, I use the folded paper towel method
[26:24.320 --> 26:29.600]  the most. In a commercial environment, I may use the Rapid Rooter method next, but I honestly do
[26:29.600 --> 26:35.200]  not start seeds directly in soil anymore. I found that I can start a lot more in much less space by
[26:35.200 --> 26:40.000]  using the Rapid Rooters. Imagine the amount of space it takes to start 100 Rapid Rooters
[26:40.000 --> 26:45.520]  compared to 100 beer cups. It's a large difference in the amount of space that you need.
[26:45.520 --> 26:49.680]  I honestly don't have any experience with the Jiffy Cubes. I've never had to use those. I've
[26:49.680 --> 26:53.440]  always had access to the Rapid Rooters. And honestly, I've just been sticking with the
[26:53.440 --> 26:59.840]  paper towel method. So that's what I'm doing the most. I encourage you to use the method that works
[26:59.840 --> 27:05.040]  the best for you. I encourage you also to try different methods. If you think something works
[27:05.040 --> 27:09.680]  great, why not try another method? If you've got some seeds that you can spare, why not try
[27:09.680 --> 27:14.640]  something? You may find that something works better for you. All right, so now we've got our
[27:14.640 --> 27:19.520]  seeds germinated. We've either got some seeds folded into a paper towel, or we've got a Rapid
[27:19.520 --> 27:24.960]  Rooter or a Root Riot or a Rockwool Cube with roots hanging out of the bottom of the root cube.
[27:24.960 --> 27:31.040]  Our next step is to pot our new seedling into a pot of soil or soilless mix.
[27:32.320 --> 27:39.760]  In this episode, I will cover how to pot the seeds germinated from a paper towel into soil.
[27:40.400 --> 27:46.160]  But my next episode is going to be about cutting clones. Then shortly after that, we will have to
[27:46.160 --> 27:53.040]  pot the clones into soil, which means I'm going to do a combo episode of planting our new seedlings
[27:53.040 --> 27:58.960]  in the Rapid Rooters and planting clones in Rapid Rooters into soil at the same time. I'm just
[27:58.960 --> 28:04.480]  going to knock that out in one episode, so that part will be coming soon. But for now, let's talk
[28:04.480 --> 28:09.920]  about planting our freshly germinated seedlings that are just sitting in a wet paper towel.
[28:09.920 --> 28:14.720]  I like to catch these seeds when the new tap roots are very short. I don't like to get it too long
[28:14.720 --> 28:19.920]  and too out of control because I feel like that gives me too much opportunity to cause it too much
[28:19.920 --> 28:24.800]  stress. So as soon as I see my seedlings crack open a little bit and that little tap root is
[28:24.800 --> 28:30.880]  sticking out just a little tiny bit, I'm comfortable putting them into their soil or soilless mix.
[28:30.880 --> 28:36.160]  And I do that with a very similar method as I did earlier when we talked about planting seeds
[28:36.160 --> 28:42.800]  into the beer cups. I get a beer cup or a very small pot with plenty of drainage. I fill it with
[28:42.800 --> 28:47.760]  a quality soil that is good for small plants, something with a lot of aeration and plenty of
[28:47.760 --> 28:54.880]  drainage. Then I moisten that soil with water pH around 6 to 6.3. Then I do the same thing as we've
[28:54.880 --> 29:00.960]  been doing the whole episode. I make a little tiny hole about knuckle deep in that soil. Then I simply
[29:00.960 --> 29:07.760]  place the germinated seed in that little hole. I do my best to point it with that little white root
[29:07.760 --> 29:13.040]  pointing straight down. If your tap root is nice and short, don't worry about which direction your
[29:13.040 --> 29:18.320]  seedling is facing when you place it into soil. It should be just fine. If it's really long, you may
[29:18.320 --> 29:23.840]  want to make sure you point that root down and the seed is going up. So gently place your seedling in
[29:23.840 --> 29:29.040]  the soil, brush dirt over the top of it. You don't need to bury it or pack it down. Just cover it and
[29:29.040 --> 29:34.080]  then the tap root will go down. It'll start to spread out and the little tiny plant will grow up
[29:34.080 --> 29:38.720]  to the top and it'll push the seedling with a little set of tiny tiny leaves right through the
[29:38.720 --> 29:44.000]  top soil and you'll have a little starter baby plant. The main thing to worry about when potting
[29:44.000 --> 29:49.920]  your new seedlings is to not damage that little white tap root sticking out of the seedling. Do
[29:49.920 --> 29:56.080]  your best not to disrupt, stress, or damage that little white tap root. They're very delicate.
[29:56.080 --> 30:00.720]  So once I've got it potted, I put it under a T5 light. I keep the light a little distance away so
[30:00.720 --> 30:05.200]  that I don't shock the plant. As the plant gets bigger, I bring the light a little bit closer.
[30:05.200 --> 30:10.240]  Once I feel like the plant has kind of taken off, I put a fan on it and then once it gets its first
[30:10.240 --> 30:18.080]  set of serrated leaves, I start adding very light doses of nutrients. So that is how I pot my
[30:18.080 --> 30:23.600]  seedling that was germinated from a paper towel. I basically fill a beer cup with good dirt, poke
[30:23.600 --> 30:29.040]  a hole in the bottom, go knuckle deep in the soil on the top, drop my little germinated seedling in
[30:29.040 --> 30:34.480]  there and cover it up and then put it under the light and wait for it to pop up and then it grows
[30:34.480 --> 30:39.680]  and grows until I see a set of leaves with serration and that is when I start feeding it a
[30:39.680 --> 30:45.680]  little bit of light nutrients. Now let's talk about a couple of things that happen quite often when we
[30:45.680 --> 30:52.640]  are working with seeds. Sometimes the seed shell will get stuck to the seed and hinder the seed's
[30:52.640 --> 30:58.480]  growth and threaten that seed's life. That is not as scary as it looks. When it happens, you'll know
[30:58.480 --> 31:03.120]  what I'm talking about. That seed hole will just get stuck. The seedling will come up out of the
[31:03.120 --> 31:07.360]  dirt and you'll see that seed, the leaves are trying to open up, it's trying to live and it's
[31:07.360 --> 31:11.760]  just trying to open up but it can't because that seed casing is just stuck to it. That is really
[31:11.760 --> 31:18.000]  easy to solve. I get a spray bottle with water and I moisten that seedling really heavily. Just
[31:18.000 --> 31:22.560]  spray it with water. Just keep spraying it. More moisture, more moisture, more moisture. Then,
[31:23.280 --> 31:27.040]  see if you can just brush it off with your finger. It may just come right off. If not,
[31:27.040 --> 31:32.800]  spray more water. If that still doesn't work, get some tweezers and just do a gentle dissection.
[31:32.800 --> 31:37.520]  If it is really moist, you should be able to get that seed casing off. It is supposed to come off
[31:37.520 --> 31:42.800]  of there. That plant opens up. The way the plant opens itself up, the way that that seed casing
[31:42.800 --> 31:47.120]  spreads in half, it should pop right off of there. Just give it a little assistance. A little
[31:47.120 --> 31:51.360]  moisture, little tweezers, maybe a pair of chopsticks depending on how skilled you are.
[31:51.360 --> 31:55.760]  It shouldn't be too hard to do. Don't be afraid to get in there and pull that casing off.
[31:56.320 --> 32:02.320]  Earlier, I talked about not using heat mats. I've honestly seen people roast more seeds with heat
[32:02.320 --> 32:08.480]  mats than I've ever seen success with a heat mat from a seedling. The only time I have ever needed
[32:08.480 --> 32:14.080]  a heat mat was when I was growing in a warehouse in Colorado and it was really cold during the
[32:14.080 --> 32:20.240]  winter. Other times, I don't use a heat mat for cloning or for seedlings and I have great success.
[32:20.240 --> 32:25.600]  If you are comfortable in the area, your seedlings are probably comfortable in that area also.
[32:25.600 --> 32:29.840]  I'm not talking about some Colorado mountain boy who's outside barefoot in the snow. I'm talking
[32:29.840 --> 32:34.560]  about a normal person. Room temperature is acceptable for your seedlings.
[32:34.560 --> 32:38.240]  Now, I've got one more thing I want to touch on before I start wrapping up the episode
[32:38.240 --> 32:44.800]  and the note I wrote is called pre-soak. A lot of people like to pre-soak their seeds before the
[32:44.800 --> 32:50.000]  official germination. If you have got older seeds that have been sitting around for longer, I may
[32:50.000 --> 32:55.920]  recommend you give them a pre-soak. It's really easy. You simply pre-soak them in water before
[32:55.920 --> 33:02.240]  you germinate them. I recommend 12 hours, maybe 24 at the most. Never go more than 24 hours on a
[33:02.240 --> 33:08.880]  soak because that will drown your seeds. My theory behind the pre-soak is some seeds just have a hard
[33:08.880 --> 33:14.480]  outer coating and they don't want to germinate very easily. Soaking them in water for 24 hours
[33:14.480 --> 33:20.080]  will definitely soften that outer coating and encourage easier germination. If you've got older
[33:20.080 --> 33:24.720]  seeds that you've been having a problem getting to germinate, maybe soak them for 12 hours,
[33:24.720 --> 33:29.760]  then give them the paper towel method. If that doesn't work, try soaking some for 24 hours,
[33:29.760 --> 33:34.160]  then giving them the paper towel method. If that doesn't work, then we're going to need to try
[33:34.160 --> 33:38.880]  more scientific approaches. There are chemicals we can add. There are tricks we can do, but that
[33:38.880 --> 33:44.480]  is much more advanced science than what we're prepared for today. So if you've got old seeds,
[33:44.480 --> 33:48.640]  or if you feel like you've got really hard seeds with a really thick coating, don't be afraid to
[33:48.640 --> 33:53.840]  give them a pre-soak. 12 to 24 hours. Never go more than 24 hours. I don't feel like that's a
[33:53.840 --> 33:59.280]  good idea. All right, you guys, I feel like that is a good lesson on how to germinate your seeds.
[33:59.280 --> 34:04.320]  I will not forget to teach you guys how to pot those freshly sprouted seeds that you've got in
[34:04.320 --> 34:09.600]  your Rapid Rooters or your Rockwool Cubes, like I told you not to do, or in your Jiffy Pots. We'll
[34:09.600 --> 34:14.720]  talk about that in a future episode. That is written down. That is on the schedule. You guys,
