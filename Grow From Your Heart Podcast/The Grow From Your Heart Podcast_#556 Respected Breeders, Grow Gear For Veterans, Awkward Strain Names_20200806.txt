[00:55.310 --> 00:56.310]  Welcome to the show, bro.
[00:56.310 --> 00:57.310]  Thanks, man.
[00:57.310 --> 00:58.310]  What's up, everybody?
[00:58.310 --> 01:00.470]  Oh, you sound good on the microphone today.
[01:00.470 --> 01:01.470]  Just make sure you keep that mic right in your face.
[01:01.470 --> 01:03.990]  Trying to stay right up on this sucker tonight.
[01:03.990 --> 01:07.710]  Yes, we got a couple of comments on Mike being too quiet last time.
[01:08.350 --> 01:09.350]  I apologize.
[01:09.350 --> 01:10.350]  That is my fault, my responsibility.
[01:10.350 --> 01:12.670]  You sounded really good in our headphones that episode.
[01:12.670 --> 01:16.670]  As soon as I hit play the next day after it posted, I was disappointed too.
[01:16.670 --> 01:17.670]  Sorry, y'all.
[01:17.670 --> 01:19.150]  It wasn't our fault.
[01:19.150 --> 01:20.430]  It was my fault, technically.
[01:20.430 --> 01:24.350]  I'm the one responsible for that, but it sounds really good in the headphones now.
[01:24.350 --> 01:26.750]  It sounded really good in the headphones last time when I played it back.
[01:26.750 --> 01:27.750]  It was real quiet.
[01:27.750 --> 01:29.030]  So we're just going to keep you real loud this time.
[01:29.030 --> 01:30.990]  I think it'll be cool for the people that are listening.
[01:30.990 --> 01:32.950]  We apologize if Mike was too quiet last time.
[01:32.950 --> 01:33.950]  We're going to fix it.
[01:33.950 --> 01:35.830]  We're going to do a good show this time.
[01:35.830 --> 01:37.670]  This is the part of the show where we're asking, what are you smoking on?
[01:38.630 --> 01:40.390]  Some local flower, man.
[01:40.390 --> 01:41.390]  Local flower.
[01:41.390 --> 01:42.390]  I like that.
[01:42.390 --> 01:44.790]  Is that incognito for gray market, free market?
[01:44.790 --> 01:46.590]  Is that what local flower means?
[01:46.590 --> 01:48.230]  It was just a gift from a buddy.
[01:48.230 --> 01:49.590]  All right, we're going to move forward.
[01:49.590 --> 01:51.590]  It sounds like you're trying to be vague on purpose.
[01:51.590 --> 01:52.590]  I myself am.
[01:52.590 --> 01:55.870]  It's just a nice hybrid, locally grown.
[01:55.870 --> 01:58.270]  Colorado, it's legal to grow your own.
[01:58.270 --> 02:00.590]  You're allowed to keep and gift your own harvest, man.
[02:00.590 --> 02:01.590]  That's the truth.
[02:01.590 --> 02:02.590]  Hell yeah.
[02:02.590 --> 02:03.590]  Got to love legal land.
[02:03.590 --> 02:04.590]  Free freedom.
[02:04.590 --> 02:07.470]  I am smoking on Gunslinger Remix Live Batter.
[02:07.470 --> 02:10.270]  I've been talking about this one on a lot of episodes lately.
[02:10.270 --> 02:14.950]  I may have bought several grams because I bought a gram of it, came home, dabbed it,
[02:14.950 --> 02:19.670]  drove back to the dispensary, and was like, I will take my limit, my remaining daily limit
[02:19.670 --> 02:20.670]  on that product, please.
[02:20.670 --> 02:21.670]  Get some rest.
[02:21.670 --> 02:22.670]  Yes.
[02:22.670 --> 02:26.110]  And then I may have gone back the next day and repeated that process because I really
[02:26.110 --> 02:29.470]  enjoy the Gunslinger Remix Live Batter from Green Dot Labs.
[02:29.470 --> 02:32.390]  Real quickly, it is a blend of Starfighter and Star Dog.
[02:32.390 --> 02:35.430]  It's supposed to taste like sour, fruit, and fuel.
[02:35.430 --> 02:36.430]  I agree with that.
[02:36.430 --> 02:42.790]  The back of the package says 65.83% THC and non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[02:42.790 --> 02:44.950]  Great product, great flavor, great buzz.
[02:44.950 --> 02:45.950]  Can't talk enough about it.
[02:45.950 --> 02:47.790]  Shout out to Green Dot Labs.
[02:47.790 --> 02:52.350]  All right, Mike, at this point of the show, I usually do shout outs to people who support
[02:52.350 --> 02:54.430]  my Patreon campaign.
[02:54.430 --> 02:56.150]  You've got a brand new Patreon campaign.
[02:56.150 --> 02:59.790]  Make sure you follow my buddy at patreon.com forward slash white Mike.
[02:59.790 --> 03:03.930]  But before I do shout outs, would you like to do shout outs to the people who are supporting
[03:03.930 --> 03:04.930]  you on Patreon?
[03:05.930 --> 03:09.930]  Yeah, man, I've got a partial list of supporters right here.
[03:09.930 --> 03:12.330]  I liked your idea of doing 710.
[03:12.330 --> 03:19.050]  So the white Mike 710 club as it stands right now, EZ057, thank you, man.
[03:19.050 --> 03:20.050]  Appreciate the support.
[03:20.050 --> 03:22.130]  OG Purple Thumb and Prospect.
[03:22.130 --> 03:25.890]  Seriously, I appreciate everything you guys are doing for me.
[03:25.890 --> 03:27.690]  Farmer Z and Learning and Burning.
[03:27.690 --> 03:29.330]  Did you guys rule?
[03:29.330 --> 03:31.410]  Thank you so much for supporting what we do here.
[03:31.410 --> 03:32.730]  Yeah, big shout out to those guys.
[03:32.730 --> 03:33.810]  A lot of familiar names there.
[03:33.810 --> 03:36.290]  I'm looking down at my shout out list to making sure we didn't.
[03:36.290 --> 03:38.330]  Army is is supportive.
[03:38.330 --> 03:39.410]  Yes, they are.
[03:39.410 --> 03:40.410]  Thank you guys.
[03:40.410 --> 03:41.610]  Thank you for supporting white Mike.
[03:41.610 --> 03:45.970]  Again, if you want to support white Mike on Patreon, it is patreon.com forward slash white
[03:45.970 --> 03:46.970]  Mike.
[03:46.970 --> 03:49.570]  He is a huge contributor to the show to the community to the industry.
[03:49.570 --> 03:51.450]  So show my buddy a little bit of love.
[03:51.450 --> 03:52.690]  And once again, thanks to all those folks.
[03:52.690 --> 03:57.490]  Now I'm going to do the shout outs to the folks that I owe some love to my 710 club.
[03:57.490 --> 04:00.050]  Let's give a big shout out to Darius from Cerritos.
[04:00.050 --> 04:01.050]  That's the coolest name ever.
[04:01.050 --> 04:02.810]  Shout out to Darius from Cerritos.
[04:02.810 --> 04:05.610]  I wonder if we ever hung out if we bumped into each other at the Cerritos mall when
[04:05.610 --> 04:07.210]  I lived in California.
[04:07.210 --> 04:08.210]  What's up, bro?
[04:08.210 --> 04:09.210]  Making me miss the coast.
[04:09.210 --> 04:10.490]  Also, let's send a big shit.
[04:10.490 --> 04:11.490]  Thank you.
[04:11.490 --> 04:12.490]  Shout out to nurse geek.
[04:12.490 --> 04:13.490]  Also a big thank you.
[04:13.490 --> 04:14.490]  Shout out to Xavier.
[04:14.490 --> 04:16.490]  Of course, let's send a big thank you to grim ball the druid.
[04:16.490 --> 04:17.490]  What's up, Graham?
[04:17.490 --> 04:18.490]  Hope you're doing well, brother.
[04:18.490 --> 04:19.490]  Also, let's send a big thank you.
[04:19.490 --> 04:20.890]  Shout out to bong breath.
[04:20.890 --> 04:23.050]  Anybody named bong breath is my friend.
[04:23.050 --> 04:26.530]  Also let's send a big thank you to stabby Mc motherfucking stab dude.
[04:26.530 --> 04:27.530]  What up stabby?
[04:27.530 --> 04:28.530]  Good to see you, brother.
[04:28.530 --> 04:29.530]  Hope you're doing well.
[04:29.530 --> 04:30.530]  Good to hear from you.
[04:30.530 --> 04:31.850]  Didn't see you on embracing organics tonight.
[04:31.890 --> 04:33.730]  I hope I catch up with you next week.
[04:33.730 --> 04:36.550]  Also, let's send a big thank you to baked PWN.
[04:36.550 --> 04:37.550]  That's baked pwn.
[04:37.550 --> 04:40.490]  I like their pwning motherfuckers old school internet slang.
[04:40.490 --> 04:42.650]  I asked him what the PWN was about.
[04:42.650 --> 04:44.070]  It's like when you pwn people.
[04:44.070 --> 04:45.450]  So big shout out to baked.
[04:45.450 --> 04:46.570]  Keep pwning them.
[04:46.570 --> 04:47.730]  Also I haven't heard from you in a moment.
[04:47.730 --> 04:48.730]  I'm glad you're doing well.
[04:48.730 --> 04:49.730]  I got a recent update.
[04:49.730 --> 04:51.490]  Big shout out to my buddy dick goals.
[04:51.490 --> 04:52.490]  What's up, bro?
[04:52.490 --> 04:53.490]  Good to see you're doing well.
[04:53.490 --> 04:55.010]  Hope you're doing great again.
[04:55.010 --> 04:56.010]  Also let's send a big thank you.
[04:56.010 --> 04:57.250]  Shout out to Andrew G.
[04:57.250 --> 05:00.650]  And last but certainly not least on my long list of thank you shout outs.
[05:00.890 --> 05:04.250]  I want to send a thank you shout out to our new friend Maroney.
[05:04.250 --> 05:07.370]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who supports the show.
[05:07.370 --> 05:10.850]  Of course, if you're not already supporting the show on Patreon, all you have to do is
[05:10.850 --> 05:15.890]  visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[05:15.890 --> 05:20.050]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[05:20.050 --> 05:23.090]  And of course I did include a link in the show notes and the video description to make
[05:23.090 --> 05:24.090]  it easy.
[05:24.090 --> 05:26.570]  I almost got through that one without having to clear my throat.
[05:26.570 --> 05:28.810]  Big shout out to green dot labs.
[05:28.810 --> 05:29.810]  Let's see.
[05:29.970 --> 05:34.130]  Now, Mike, I think this is the part of the show where we should just segue into reading
[05:34.130 --> 05:37.690]  emails and listener questions.
[05:37.690 --> 05:41.530]  People know that we will get rambly on accident at some point in this show.
[05:41.530 --> 05:42.530]  All right.
[05:42.530 --> 05:43.730]  It's going to happen.
[05:43.730 --> 05:47.850]  I wish I would have just clipped out you going segue and just play that all the time when
[05:47.850 --> 05:50.090]  I need just a smooth transition.
[05:50.090 --> 05:51.090]  Segue.
[05:51.090 --> 05:52.090]  All right.
[05:52.090 --> 05:53.090]  Today's first email.
[05:53.090 --> 05:57.290]  Again, if you've got an email or a question, a question, a correction or a concern, my
[05:57.290 --> 05:59.970]  email address is grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[05:59.970 --> 06:02.290]  You know, I would love to hear from you.
[06:02.290 --> 06:04.610]  Today's first message goes like this.
[06:04.610 --> 06:07.770]  It says, if this makes it on the show, refer to me as send zoo.
[06:07.770 --> 06:09.490]  So what up sends you good to hear from you.
[06:09.490 --> 06:11.250]  The message says, Hey, Rasta Jeff.
[06:11.250 --> 06:13.050]  I hope all is well with you and yours.
[06:13.050 --> 06:17.450]  I'm just dropping in to say the audio quality is great with the lapel mic.
[06:17.450 --> 06:18.450]  Thank you.
[06:18.450 --> 06:20.330]  Cause I got mixed feedback and mixed emotions.
[06:20.330 --> 06:24.570]  It says, I feel like the standalone mic had more crisp audio quality, but regardless,
[06:24.570 --> 06:25.570]  it sounds great.
[06:25.570 --> 06:28.450]  And I would imagine it would be perfect for indulging during the show.
[06:28.450 --> 06:29.450]  Yes.
[06:29.450 --> 06:30.450]  It makes it easier to dab.
[06:30.450 --> 06:32.770]  It makes it easier to just move my arms around.
[06:32.770 --> 06:34.970]  I smack this mic a lot, just more comfortable.
[06:34.970 --> 06:36.970]  Take up a lot of desk space.
[06:36.970 --> 06:37.970]  Yeah.
[06:37.970 --> 06:40.370]  And if you don't stay on it right here, like I keep reminding Mike, then he can't hear
[06:40.370 --> 06:41.930]  us and we start sounding like shit.
[06:41.930 --> 06:44.890]  So but yeah, the lapel mic is a new experience.
[06:44.890 --> 06:45.970]  It's more comfortable.
[06:45.970 --> 06:46.970]  There's nothing in my face.
[06:46.970 --> 06:48.010]  I can talk with my hands.
[06:48.010 --> 06:49.530]  I can definitely dab a little bit more.
[06:49.530 --> 06:53.330]  It makes it more conversational if there's somebody in the conversation with me, but
[06:53.330 --> 06:55.130]  thank you for the compliments there.
[06:55.130 --> 07:00.250]  And it goes on to say, um, also I really enjoyed the fade in mellow outro music and
[07:00.250 --> 07:01.450]  five 52.
[07:01.450 --> 07:04.690]  I don't remember which track I played on the outro of five 52.
[07:04.690 --> 07:06.050]  That may have been some music I made.
[07:06.050 --> 07:07.050]  So that's really cool compliment.
[07:07.050 --> 07:11.610]  If it was something I did, if it was the song from danks for nothing, it was that reggae
[07:11.610 --> 07:12.610]  track.
[07:12.610 --> 07:13.910]  Big shout out to danks for the amazing music.
[07:13.910 --> 07:14.910]  Thank you.
[07:14.910 --> 07:15.910]  There is more music coming.
[07:15.910 --> 07:18.490]  I did say that I was going to play more musical submissions on the show.
[07:18.490 --> 07:22.170]  I've just been so happy with that one track that I play that that is the new theme song
[07:22.170 --> 07:23.170]  for the show.
[07:23.170 --> 07:24.170]  That is like permanent.
[07:24.210 --> 07:25.210]  That is it.
[07:25.210 --> 07:28.010]  It doesn't get any better than that.
[07:28.010 --> 07:29.010]  It's pretty perfect.
[07:29.010 --> 07:30.010]  Yeah.
[07:30.010 --> 07:31.010]  Thank you.
[07:31.010 --> 07:32.010]  So thanks again to danks for nothing.
[07:32.010 --> 07:35.350]  It was well worth the, uh, the request.
[07:35.350 --> 07:36.350]  So it goes on.
[07:36.350 --> 07:38.570]  It says, I also have another question for you.
[07:38.570 --> 07:40.010]  Was there a first question in here?
[07:40.010 --> 07:41.010]  Okay.
[07:41.010 --> 07:42.010]  I have a question.
[07:42.010 --> 07:43.010]  I didn't miss a first question.
[07:43.010 --> 07:46.330]  I hope this is, I have another question for you just out of pure curiosity.
[07:46.330 --> 07:51.170]  What other breeders and genetic companies do you feel are creating really quality strains?
[07:51.170 --> 07:54.890]  I know there are a lot of breeders out there who just crank out fire strains, but I'm curious
[07:54.890 --> 07:59.650]  to know from experience who else is really breeding from the heart and why you respect
[07:59.650 --> 08:00.650]  them.
[08:00.650 --> 08:01.650]  Thanks for everything you do.
[08:01.650 --> 08:04.850]  I'll be supporting you on Patreon as soon as I am able.
[08:04.850 --> 08:07.330]  Uh, senzu, thank you for the great message.
[08:07.330 --> 08:09.610]  Uh, don't stress too hard over Patreon.
[08:09.610 --> 08:13.050]  I know I say that I will read Patreon contributors messages first.
[08:13.050 --> 08:16.970]  I do read other random messages on the show that I like that pop up in the list.
[08:16.970 --> 08:18.850]  Uh, it is COVID times.
[08:18.850 --> 08:20.450]  Life is weird right now, bro.
[08:20.450 --> 08:23.050]  I cannot expect everybody to contribute to Patreon.
[08:23.050 --> 08:24.830]  I am grateful that you are listening.
[08:24.830 --> 08:28.290]  I'm grateful that you were contributing and I'm grateful that you sent me a really great
[08:28.290 --> 08:29.290]  question.
[08:29.290 --> 08:30.770]  So let's jump into this part.
[08:30.770 --> 08:35.530]  Uh, this person wants to know who I respect as a breeder in this industry.
[08:35.530 --> 08:40.490]  I wrote down a lot of names and a lot of breeding companies, but mainly the people that I, I'm
[08:40.490 --> 08:41.650]  going to miss people.
[08:41.650 --> 08:42.650]  That's what I'm afraid of.
[08:42.650 --> 08:43.650]  I'm going to skip people.
[08:43.650 --> 08:46.330]  I can't list everybody I appreciate and respect.
[08:46.330 --> 08:47.330]  I am stoned.
[08:47.650 --> 08:53.090]  I took dabs and also I just didn't prepare well enough to think of everybody that I respect
[08:53.090 --> 08:54.250]  and trust in the industry.
[08:54.250 --> 08:59.770]  So I want to start it off by saying I respect and love the work of people who are doing
[08:59.770 --> 09:04.770]  it for the passion of the plant, of moving the plant forward, of moving the community
[09:04.770 --> 09:09.970]  forward of moving medicine forward, of moving recreational cannabis forward.
[09:09.970 --> 09:12.830]  Those are the people I love and respect and appreciate.
[09:12.830 --> 09:17.590]  The guys that are thinking about healing and thinking about making people feel good.
[09:17.590 --> 09:20.830]  And when they're in the grow, they're just beaming and smiling.
[09:20.830 --> 09:24.590]  I'm not impressed with the people who are growing for their wallet.
[09:24.590 --> 09:28.270]  The guys that are walking around going, I'm sure there's four pounds here and I'm going
[09:28.270 --> 09:29.990]  to sell each pound for 3000.
[09:29.990 --> 09:30.990]  I've got $12,000.
[09:30.990 --> 09:33.190]  I'm going to buy this.
[09:33.190 --> 09:35.290]  Those guys haven't earned my love and respect.
[09:35.290 --> 09:36.430]  Sometimes we all fall into that.
[09:36.430 --> 09:39.870]  You get excited, you get a little bit of money, your heart starts pumping.
[09:39.870 --> 09:40.870]  Get out of that.
[09:40.870 --> 09:41.870]  Get out of that.
[09:41.910 --> 09:45.590]  Go back into that grow room and think about how many people are going to feel better when
[09:45.590 --> 09:47.510]  they consume that product.
[09:47.510 --> 09:48.630]  That's what I think it's all about.
[09:48.630 --> 09:51.350]  We're making people, we are improving the quality of people's lives.
[09:51.350 --> 09:55.630]  If it's our own, if it's medical patients, if it's recreational patients, if it's those
[09:55.630 --> 09:56.630]  people's families.
[09:56.630 --> 09:59.710]  Mike, are your kids' lives better because you consume cannabis?
[09:59.710 --> 10:00.710]  Much.
[10:00.710 --> 10:01.710]  Yeah.
[10:01.710 --> 10:02.710]  Yeah.
[10:02.710 --> 10:03.710]  So it's a change.
[10:03.710 --> 10:04.710]  Much, much better.
[10:04.710 --> 10:05.710]  It's a ripple effect.
[10:05.710 --> 10:08.270]  So those are the breeders that I've got the most love and respect for.
[10:08.270 --> 10:12.830]  The guys that are growing with love and thinking about healing, not the guys growing from their
[10:12.830 --> 10:15.230]  ego or thinking about dollars in their wallets.
[10:15.230 --> 10:19.390]  If you're growing from your dick to get chicks, if you're growing from your wallet to get
[10:19.390 --> 10:21.630]  cars, like that's the wrong approach.
[10:21.630 --> 10:22.630]  Think about cannabis.
[10:22.630 --> 10:25.450]  If you're breeding, especially think about improving cannabis.
[10:25.450 --> 10:26.450]  That's our goal.
[10:26.450 --> 10:27.450]  It's like art.
[10:27.450 --> 10:30.530]  It's like we're chefs, we're artists, we're all kinds of different things rolled into
[10:30.530 --> 10:32.030]  one as breeders.
[10:32.030 --> 10:36.310]  So to give kind of a generic answer and a kind of a disclaimer that I'm going to miss
[10:36.310 --> 10:39.310]  a lot of people in this list, but that is what I look for.
[10:39.310 --> 10:43.430]  A breeder that contributes to the community, a breeder that's been around for a while,
[10:43.430 --> 10:47.090]  a breeder that has put out strains that are worth something, not people that come and
[10:47.090 --> 10:51.350]  chuck pollen and say, here's the most popular candy flavored strain and the most popular
[10:51.350 --> 10:52.590]  whatever flavored strain.
[10:52.590 --> 10:53.590]  We put them together.
[10:53.590 --> 10:54.590]  We put them out.
[10:54.590 --> 10:55.590]  We didn't test them.
[10:55.590 --> 10:56.590]  We're going to sell a shit ton of seeds.
[10:56.590 --> 10:57.590]  And guess what?
[10:57.590 --> 10:58.870]  Next year, you'll never know who we are.
[10:58.870 --> 11:00.270]  That's a whole different group of people.
[11:00.270 --> 11:04.190]  So let's talk about people that I've really got some respect for.
[11:04.190 --> 11:06.470]  In the middle of my list, I want to go ladies first.
[11:06.470 --> 11:09.510]  I just realized I wrote her down in the middle of the list, but she's going to deserve a
[11:09.510 --> 11:10.550]  top spot right now.
[11:10.550 --> 11:12.710]  Let's give a shout out to Miss Jill.
[11:12.710 --> 11:17.230]  Miss Jill is not only, it doesn't, it shouldn't even count that she's a bad-ass woman grower,
[11:17.230 --> 11:19.490]  but there aren't enough bad-ass women growers.
[11:19.490 --> 11:20.550]  The women get overlooked.
[11:20.550 --> 11:21.910]  It's kind of a boys club.
[11:21.910 --> 11:22.910]  So shout out to Miss Jill.
[11:22.910 --> 11:27.230]  I've got a lot of respect for Miss Jill as a grower and a breeder.
[11:27.230 --> 11:29.950]  When Subby was in prison, shout out to Subcool.
[11:29.950 --> 11:31.030]  Subcool taught me a lot.
[11:31.030 --> 11:36.710]  When Subby was in prison, Jill was getting cultivation books about cannabis and substituting
[11:36.710 --> 11:40.610]  all of the words that weren't allowed in prison with the word blueberries or whatever else
[11:40.610 --> 11:45.070]  so that she could get those books to Subby while he was incarcerated to keep his cannabis
[11:45.070 --> 11:46.750]  education growing.
[11:46.750 --> 11:49.750]  If that's not contributing to cannabis, I don't know what is.
[11:49.750 --> 11:54.730]  That's being a bad-ass partner, a bad-ass cannabis person, just that's being a bad motherfucker
[11:54.730 --> 11:55.730]  in general.
[11:55.730 --> 11:58.830]  So Jill deserves a little shout out and recognition for that.
[11:58.830 --> 12:02.070]  Then on top of that, she is a bad-ass breeder.
[12:02.070 --> 12:04.310]  A lot of us smoke Jilly Bean.
[12:04.310 --> 12:06.350]  We see a lot of crosses with Jilly Bean.
[12:06.350 --> 12:12.630]  Actually this jar right here, Orangatane Funk is Jilly Bean number 13 cross to Grease Monkey
[12:12.630 --> 12:15.510]  and the Jilly Bean gives it such a delicious flavor.
[12:15.510 --> 12:18.070]  A lot of people are chasing that Jilly Bean terp.
[12:18.070 --> 12:20.990]  I know a guy who's got a breeding company based off of Jilly Bean.
[12:20.990 --> 12:23.190]  So Jill created Jilly Bean.
[12:23.190 --> 12:25.790]  Jill was a big part of TGA, Team Green Avengers.
[12:25.790 --> 12:27.330]  It wasn't just Subcool.
[12:27.330 --> 12:29.610]  So Jill gets a lot of credit for that.
[12:29.610 --> 12:34.050]  Jill is also now making more crosses with the Jilly Bean and other crosses.
[12:34.050 --> 12:35.890]  So she deserves a big shout out.
[12:35.890 --> 12:40.210]  She is a breeder that I appreciate and trust and respect as a person and as a grower and
[12:40.210 --> 12:41.210]  a breeder.
[12:41.210 --> 12:42.810]  She's got reputable lines.
[12:42.810 --> 12:45.650]  She's contributed to the industry and she's not full of shit.
[12:45.650 --> 12:46.650]  She's still here.
[12:46.650 --> 12:49.290]  Longevity, I think, shows a lot in this industry.
[12:49.290 --> 12:53.050]  Like I said a moment ago, people come, they do shit at a booth for one year, you see them
[12:53.050 --> 12:55.290]  bang it out, next year they're not there.
[12:55.290 --> 12:58.570]  And they made enough money in that one year to kind of cover that year.
[12:58.570 --> 13:00.690]  But you need longevity to have a business.
[13:00.690 --> 13:02.130]  One year isn't shit in a business.
[13:02.130 --> 13:03.170]  That's just coming and going.
[13:03.170 --> 13:04.890]  That's a one hit wonder.
[13:04.890 --> 13:07.570]  So Miss Jill really stands out on my list.
[13:07.570 --> 13:09.770]  The next folks, Mike, you're going to love these guys.
[13:09.770 --> 13:14.450]  I really love, appreciate and respect Don and Aaron from DNA Genetics.
[13:14.450 --> 13:16.290]  I've grown a lot of their strains.
[13:16.290 --> 13:19.570]  They've got a lot of that cushy LA stuff that everybody was after.
[13:19.570 --> 13:24.170]  When I first started buying seeds from the Attitude Seed Bank, DNA Genetics had a lot
[13:24.170 --> 13:25.170]  of the hot fire.
[13:25.170 --> 13:26.530]  They're good dudes.
[13:26.530 --> 13:27.530]  They're chilled out dudes.
[13:27.530 --> 13:28.890]  They run a solid business.
[13:28.890 --> 13:33.970]  They've got good customer service and they've been doing it before it was a big money thing.
[13:33.970 --> 13:34.970]  They went to Amsterdam.
[13:34.970 --> 13:37.130]  They left LA and went to Amsterdam to go do this.
[13:37.130 --> 13:41.330]  They abandoned their lives and shit to go start a new life for cannabis.
[13:41.330 --> 13:43.050]  And they've always had quality products.
[13:43.050 --> 13:44.890]  They're always moving the industry forward.
[13:44.890 --> 13:46.850]  So big shout out to those guys.
[13:46.850 --> 13:49.450]  There was another name that popped in my head that I didn't write down.
[13:49.450 --> 13:50.450]  Soma.
[13:50.450 --> 13:52.010]  Soma's an old hippie dude that taught me a lot.
[13:52.010 --> 13:54.050]  And I got to give a shout out to Subcool as well.
[13:54.130 --> 13:55.410]  I want to try to get back on my list.
[13:55.410 --> 13:58.970]  So we got Miss Jill, DNA Genetics, Soma.
[13:58.970 --> 13:59.970]  Soma taught me a lot.
[13:59.970 --> 14:00.970]  He's kind of a hippie.
[14:00.970 --> 14:05.290]  Subcool taught me a lot of what to do and what not to do as a grower and a breeder and
[14:05.290 --> 14:06.370]  as a person.
[14:06.370 --> 14:09.090]  So Subcool gets a little spot on my list.
[14:09.090 --> 14:11.490]  Then we're going to talk about DJ Short.
[14:11.490 --> 14:15.250]  Mike, you're not even a breeder and you know about DJ Short.
[14:15.250 --> 14:16.250]  Yep.
[14:16.250 --> 14:17.250]  DJ Short's blueberry.
[14:17.250 --> 14:18.250]  That's so funny.
[14:18.250 --> 14:22.330]  The first, sorry, the first three or four companies you've listed, that's the foundation
[14:22.330 --> 14:25.130]  of Colorado's like legal genetic pool.
[14:25.130 --> 14:29.090]  That's what was everywhere when that got locked into place.
[14:29.090 --> 14:35.650]  And so, so much of what we enjoy on the shelves now, this is the grandparent stock.
[14:35.650 --> 14:37.010]  That's where it all came from.
[14:37.010 --> 14:38.010]  Yep.
[14:38.010 --> 14:39.130]  From Subby had a lot of the stuff out.
[14:39.130 --> 14:40.490]  Miss Jill had stuff out.
[14:40.490 --> 14:43.010]  DNA Genetics was a lot of the cushy stuff.
[14:43.010 --> 14:45.730]  The LA Kush, the LA Confidential.
[14:45.730 --> 14:46.730]  What's the one that I really liked?
[14:46.730 --> 14:48.250]  A whole bunch of the Holy Grail Kush.
[14:48.250 --> 14:50.330]  That was a part of DNA Genetics.
[14:50.330 --> 14:52.050]  That might've been Reservo Privada.
[14:52.770 --> 14:53.770]  That's a branch of DNA Genetics.
[14:53.770 --> 14:55.770]  So yeah, there's a lot of great breeders in there.
[14:55.770 --> 15:00.770]  Soma, the Lavender, the Somango, a lot of that stuff came from Soma.
[15:00.770 --> 15:03.050]  So then let me get back on track on my list here.
[15:03.050 --> 15:05.850]  DJ Short, that blueberry, Flo.
[15:05.850 --> 15:07.810]  You see blueberry and Flo everywhere.
[15:07.810 --> 15:10.930]  That old school DJ Short blueberry is super sought after.
[15:10.930 --> 15:16.330]  DJ Short is an amazing educator, an amazing breeder, a great speaker.
[15:16.330 --> 15:18.090]  He's a cool person.
[15:18.090 --> 15:20.410]  He's got to, you got to open him up to get him to talk a little bit.
[15:20.410 --> 15:23.410]  He's not super, he's not me for sure, but once you get him talking,
[15:23.410 --> 15:25.410]  he's a really friendly, really cool dude.
[15:25.410 --> 15:28.410]  Then we got to work our way down to JD.
[15:28.410 --> 15:31.810]  Not just DJ, but JD Short with second generation genetics.
[15:31.810 --> 15:33.010]  That dude is fucking killing it.
[15:33.010 --> 15:35.010]  Nothing but respect for that whole family.
[15:35.010 --> 15:38.410]  They breed with purpose, with direction.
[15:38.410 --> 15:41.410]  They don't pass on shit that is not stellar.
[15:41.410 --> 15:43.010]  They understand the art of breeding.
[15:43.010 --> 15:46.410]  All the people I've mentioned are breeding with direction and they understand it.
[15:46.410 --> 15:47.410]  That's what really matters.
[15:47.410 --> 15:49.410]  They're doing something for the community.
[15:49.410 --> 15:53.410]  Then we're going to move into a guy who probably should have been mentioned
[15:53.410 --> 15:56.410]  top, more high on the list, but I can only do so many at a time.
[15:56.410 --> 15:59.410]  Fucking Mr. Soul from Brothers Grimm.
[15:59.410 --> 16:03.410]  I really appreciate Rick Campanella as a person, as a breeder, as a grower,
[16:03.410 --> 16:04.410]  as an educator.
[16:04.410 --> 16:05.410]  Rick, shout out dude.
[16:05.410 --> 16:06.410]  I fucking love you, bro.
[16:06.410 --> 16:08.410]  Really cool guy.
[16:08.410 --> 16:10.410]  Super stylish guy also.
[16:10.410 --> 16:14.410]  He does not fit in any box and that is really cool
[16:14.410 --> 16:16.410]  because everybody's trying to be in a box right now.
[16:16.410 --> 16:18.410]  Of course, I'm this white guy, rasta hippie thing,
[16:18.410 --> 16:23.410]  but Mr. Soul has no box that he fits in and I fucking love that about a person.
[16:23.410 --> 16:24.410]  What happened, Mike?
[16:24.410 --> 16:26.410]  I think you're still here with me.
[16:26.410 --> 16:28.410]  A little glitching.
[16:28.410 --> 16:29.410]  All right.
[16:29.410 --> 16:30.410]  You keep glitching.
[16:30.410 --> 16:31.410]  If you glitch out too far, I'll fix it,
[16:31.410 --> 16:34.410]  but I'm going to keep rambling because I don't think anything went wrong.
[16:34.410 --> 16:35.410]  Keep rolling, buddy.
[16:35.410 --> 16:36.410]  Cool, bro.
[16:36.410 --> 16:38.410]  Mr. Soul, nothing but love and respect for Mr. Soul.
[16:38.410 --> 16:40.410]  The fucking Cindy 99 is an amazing cross.
[16:40.410 --> 16:42.410]  Anything that comes from Mr. Soul is quality.
[16:42.410 --> 16:43.410]  He's a good breeder.
[16:43.410 --> 16:44.410]  I see you pointing at the camera.
[16:44.410 --> 16:45.410]  Is everything going cool?
[16:45.410 --> 16:46.410]  No, we're good to go.
[16:46.410 --> 16:47.410]  All right, buddy.
[16:47.410 --> 16:49.410]  I'll cut out if anything goes too crazy.
[16:49.410 --> 16:52.410]  Mr. Soul is on my list of breeders that I appreciate.
[16:52.410 --> 16:54.410]  He teaches a lot.
[16:54.410 --> 16:56.410]  He's not stingy with information,
[16:56.410 --> 17:00.410]  and he's got a very eloquent and classy way of speaking and teaching.
[17:00.410 --> 17:03.410]  I know he's got nuclear physics degrees.
[17:03.410 --> 17:05.410]  I don't remember exactly your degree, sir.
[17:05.410 --> 17:06.410]  I should remember that.
[17:06.410 --> 17:08.410]  I should have respect for that, but I know he's an engineer.
[17:08.410 --> 17:11.410]  He's very highly educated from a very well-known school,
[17:11.410 --> 17:13.410]  so he's a super smart guy.
[17:13.410 --> 17:15.410]  He could talk to me like I'm stupid.
[17:15.410 --> 17:17.410]  He really could, but he doesn't.
[17:17.410 --> 17:19.410]  He talks to me like we're equals, like we're brothers.
[17:19.410 --> 17:22.410]  He came to an event and shook my hand and said hello to me.
[17:22.410 --> 17:24.410]  That kind of stuff means a lot to me.
[17:24.410 --> 17:26.410]  Also, I posted a podcast about Femseeds,
[17:26.410 --> 17:29.410]  and it got the Mr. Soul seal of approval.
[17:29.410 --> 17:32.410]  He shared the episode, so that made me giddy that day.
[17:32.410 --> 17:34.410]  Thank you, Rick. I appreciate that.
[17:34.410 --> 17:36.410]  Who else do we need to give love to?
[17:36.410 --> 17:39.410]  Odie fucking Diesel from Homegrown Natural Wonders.
[17:39.410 --> 17:42.410]  That dude is a really cool guy.
[17:42.410 --> 17:44.410]  I imagine if he lived in my neighborhood,
[17:44.410 --> 17:46.410]  he'd have to kick me off of his couch because he's older than me.
[17:46.410 --> 17:48.410]  He's been to more dead shows than a lot of people I know.
[17:48.410 --> 17:50.410]  He's got a cool vibe. He grows a lot.
[17:50.410 --> 17:52.410]  He smokes a lot. He's been breeding for a while.
[17:52.410 --> 17:54.410]  He'd have to make me leave.
[17:54.410 --> 17:55.410]  I'd just be there hanging out all the time.
[17:55.410 --> 17:57.410]  He would be my bro if we lived closer to each other.
[17:57.410 --> 17:59.410]  So shout out to Odie Diesel. Really cool guy.
[17:59.410 --> 18:03.410]  His whole crew, a bunch of young hippie kids out there on the coast, loving it.
[18:03.410 --> 18:05.410]  Good kids, Mushmouth, the whole gang.
[18:05.410 --> 18:08.410]  I miss those guys. I wish we could have events to go hang out again.
[18:08.410 --> 18:12.410]  And then I do have one more guy at the top of my list that I don't talk about a lot,
[18:12.410 --> 18:15.410]  and then I'm going to write down another name because I definitely have to cover him.
[18:15.410 --> 18:18.410]  Another guy that I don't talk about a lot,
[18:18.410 --> 18:20.410]  he's been around for a long time.
[18:20.410 --> 18:22.410]  He's a badass grower, badass breeder.
[18:22.410 --> 18:24.410]  He's got clout. He's got a reputation.
[18:24.410 --> 18:27.410]  I didn't watch enough of his videos.
[18:27.410 --> 18:30.410]  He wasn't social media and quarantine really made us come out more.
[18:30.410 --> 18:32.410]  We're talking more. We're doing more live feeds.
[18:32.410 --> 18:35.410]  We're exposing our identities and ourselves and personalities.
[18:35.410 --> 18:40.410]  I have grown a lot of respect for JJ from Top Dog.
[18:40.410 --> 18:44.410]  He's a New Yorker, and if he feels like he needs to tell you to go fuck yourself,
[18:44.410 --> 18:45.410]  he'll tell you to go fuck yourself.
[18:45.410 --> 18:47.410]  But if he feels like he needs to tell you that he's proud of you,
[18:47.410 --> 18:49.410]  he'll tell you that he's proud of you.
[18:49.410 --> 18:52.410]  And I love a person who doesn't hold back and sugarcoat shit
[18:52.410 --> 18:55.410]  just so that they can have more friends or likes or followers.
[18:55.410 --> 18:57.410]  If you say something about a certain guy and he's like,
[18:57.410 --> 18:59.410]  nah, that guy fucked me over in 82, fuck that piece of shit.
[18:59.410 --> 19:02.410]  He'll say it. That's the New Yorker in him, and I love it.
[19:02.410 --> 19:04.410]  He also talks like a New Yorker.
[19:04.410 --> 19:07.410]  He's got that fucking brash New York accent, and I love it.
[19:08.410 --> 19:11.410]  It's just something about when people speak differently, I'm drawn to them.
[19:11.410 --> 19:15.410]  So he breeds well. He speaks his mind. He deserves the respect.
[19:15.410 --> 19:17.410]  He's been around for a long time.
[19:17.410 --> 19:20.410]  All these guys I'm talking about, you've seen their names and their shit
[19:20.410 --> 19:23.410]  on advertising and on signs because they've been around for a long time.
[19:23.410 --> 19:26.410]  So those folks all get some huge respect.
[19:26.410 --> 19:29.410]  There was one more guy I wanted to mention, and his name left my brain
[19:29.410 --> 19:34.410]  while I was talking, but I did write down Kevin Jodry.
[19:34.410 --> 19:39.410]  Dude, Kevin Jodry is a breeder, a grower, a cultivator, a fucking hustler,
[19:39.410 --> 19:43.410]  a career hustler, a badass motherfucker in general.
[19:43.410 --> 19:46.410]  That is one of the people that I really think is moving the industry,
[19:46.410 --> 19:48.410]  the community, and the plant forward.
[19:48.410 --> 19:51.410]  He does so much. He talks, he teaches, he breeds.
[19:51.410 --> 19:56.410]  I think he is what I was aspiring to be before I even knew he existed.
[19:56.410 --> 20:00.410]  Kevin Jodry is another person that I've got a lot of respect for
[20:00.410 --> 20:02.410]  and look up to as a grower and breeder.
[20:02.410 --> 20:05.410]  I feel like there was one more name in there that I wanted to shout out,
[20:05.410 --> 20:09.410]  but it left my brain. It may have been Big Mike from Exotic.
[20:09.410 --> 20:12.410]  He's killing it. I'm sure there are more out there that are going to pop
[20:12.410 --> 20:14.410]  into my brain as the episode goes by.
[20:14.410 --> 20:16.410]  You're going to forget in a couple that you're going to feel bad.
[20:16.410 --> 20:18.410]  As soon as we hit end, you'll be like, oh man, I forgot.
[20:18.410 --> 20:20.410]  Oh shit, this guy and this guy and this gal probably too.
[20:20.410 --> 20:23.410]  Fucking jinx proof. Yeah, I could do this all night.
[20:23.410 --> 20:26.410]  So you guys, if you're breeding out there and I see you at the events,
[20:26.410 --> 20:27.410]  I got nothing but love and respect for you.
[20:27.410 --> 20:30.410]  If I forgot you on this list, I'm fucking sorry. I'm high as shit.
[20:30.410 --> 20:33.410]  And I'm just not trying to make this a 45 minute segment.
[20:33.410 --> 20:36.410]  So I appreciate the people that are breeding with purpose,
[20:36.410 --> 20:38.410]  the people that are moving the plants forward, the people that are killing it.
[20:38.410 --> 20:39.410]  You guys know who you are.
[20:39.410 --> 20:42.410]  And if you feel like you should have been on this list and I forgot,
[20:42.410 --> 20:43.410]  I'm sorry, bro. I love you.
[20:43.410 --> 20:44.410]  You got nothing but love for you.
[20:44.410 --> 20:47.410]  All the breeders out there, Matt Riot.
[20:47.410 --> 20:49.410]  Let's include Matt Riot and then we're going to move forward.
[20:49.410 --> 20:52.410]  Matt Riot has a very unique personality.
[20:52.410 --> 20:55.410]  Matt Riot has no fear to tell somebody to go fuck themselves.
[20:55.410 --> 20:58.410]  Matt Riot is very opinionated, but also very educated.
[20:58.410 --> 21:01.410]  And I like the way he does his thing. He's a good breeder.
[21:01.410 --> 21:03.410]  He breeds quality. He only releases quality.
[21:03.410 --> 21:06.410]  He understands the plant. He understands the community.
[21:06.410 --> 21:09.410]  And he understands the history and importance of cannabis.
[21:09.410 --> 21:13.410]  So he is on my list of breeders that I trust, love, and respect.
[21:13.410 --> 21:15.410]  You're on there, Matt.
[21:15.410 --> 21:18.410]  Even though you're fucking opinionated and you got your personality,
[21:18.410 --> 21:19.410]  I respect that.
[21:19.410 --> 21:22.410]  Like I said earlier, people with the personality that tell you to go fuck yourself.
[21:22.410 --> 21:24.410]  That means a lot to me. That's integrity.
[21:24.410 --> 21:27.410]  So even though he may have told a lot of people to fuck themselves and he
[21:27.410 --> 21:30.410]  ruffles a lot of feathers, doesn't bother me one bit.
[21:30.410 --> 21:34.410]  All right, we're going to move on from the breeders that I love and respect and appreciate.
[21:34.410 --> 21:38.410]  I want to thank our friend Senzu for the great message that got me going on a long rant.
[21:38.410 --> 21:40.410]  Thank you. I appreciate that.
[21:40.410 --> 21:45.410]  Big shout out to all the breeders out there growing from their heart and doing it because they mean it.
[21:45.410 --> 21:48.410]  All right, Mike, you doing well? Your technical glitches catching up?
[21:48.410 --> 21:51.410]  Doing good. It's been smooth. We just a little lag issue. We're good.
[21:51.410 --> 21:55.410]  All right. All right. It's probably because it's our neighborhood where we are about this time.
[21:55.410 --> 21:57.410]  Let me start getting a little glitchy.
[21:57.410 --> 22:01.410]  Let's jump into another message that came from our friend C Dub in Michigan.
[22:01.410 --> 22:05.410]  This is a great message, Mike. I thought you may have some good insight on this one.
[22:05.410 --> 22:11.410]  This one says, Rasta Jeff, disabled veterans are close to my heart and that of my family.
[22:11.410 --> 22:15.410]  And I try to keep I try to help them establish medical grows whenever I can.
[22:15.410 --> 22:20.410]  For many reasons, these men and women, the cost of equipment is simply too much.
[22:20.410 --> 22:25.410]  I would like to organize a cooperative amongst growers that would directly that would direct older,
[22:25.410 --> 22:30.410]  but usable equipment from growers who are trading up to this group of veterans,
[22:30.410 --> 22:35.410]  many of whom will suffer who will suffer and continuing medical need.
[22:35.410 --> 22:37.410]  How would you organize such an effort?
[22:37.410 --> 22:45.410]  And how would you reach out to those that have on behalf of those who don't from C Dub in Michigan?
[22:45.410 --> 22:48.410]  So this is a great idea. We've got a very compassionate person here.
[22:48.410 --> 22:55.410]  Our friend C Dub wants to know how they can create a program to get grow equipment from growers hands
[22:55.410 --> 22:58.410]  who are done with that equipment. They're upgrading. Maybe they've given up.
[22:58.410 --> 23:02.410]  Maybe they've got some new shit. They want to move that old equipment instead of throwing it away,
[23:02.410 --> 23:07.410]  putting it in the dumpster. They want to get it to veterans who are then able to grow their own medicine
[23:07.410 --> 23:09.410]  because a lot of these veterans are on a fixed income.
[23:09.410 --> 23:12.410]  They're getting Social Security or disability checks possibly.
[23:12.410 --> 23:14.410]  And that doesn't go very far these days.
[23:15.410 --> 23:19.410]  So they need a little bit of cannabis and growing it themselves would be the perfect way to do it.
[23:19.410 --> 23:21.410]  We just need to get them equipment.
[23:21.410 --> 23:26.410]  So what are some great ways we could think of to kind of organize a cooperative
[23:26.410 --> 23:31.410]  and get some used but still usable equipment into the hands of these people who helped us out?
[23:31.410 --> 23:34.410]  Mike, you have any ideas for me? Because I wrote down a few things.
[23:35.410 --> 23:43.410]  This is a tricky one because the grow community tends to be, rightly so, quite paranoid.
[23:43.410 --> 23:48.410]  And so getting a whole bunch of people to gather together and say,
[23:48.410 --> 23:54.410]  hey, we all grow cannabis is tricky for any reason.
[23:54.410 --> 24:02.410]  And then to double down on the difficulty you're adding and asking for donations.
[24:03.410 --> 24:06.410]  Donations of expensive equipment.
[24:06.410 --> 24:12.410]  So it's going to be all about building personal relationships with existing growers
[24:12.410 --> 24:19.410]  and prospective growers and figuring out who needs what and who has what extra.
[24:21.410 --> 24:28.410]  And helping putting people either, helping make the switch or putting people in contact with each other.
[24:29.410 --> 24:32.410]  You're going to have to build your friends list, man.
[24:32.410 --> 24:35.410]  Yeah. I hadn't considered the legality part.
[24:35.410 --> 24:38.410]  I don't know if you're in prohibition land or if you're in a green state,
[24:38.410 --> 24:42.410]  but that's going to play a big factor into how this program works out.
[24:42.410 --> 24:46.410]  I've tried to wrangle growers for stuff before.
[24:46.410 --> 24:51.410]  And when I'm like, hey, I need a whole bunch of people to come and stand up and say,
[24:51.410 --> 24:54.410]  hey, we grow and immediately the room gets empty.
[24:54.410 --> 24:55.410]  Right.
[24:56.410 --> 24:59.410]  It's just something that freaks people out.
[24:59.410 --> 25:03.410]  My idea was maybe you could post something to Craigslist where people are buying and selling grow equipment
[25:03.410 --> 25:05.410]  and just post your idea.
[25:05.410 --> 25:09.410]  Just say, hey, I've got a veteran friend here who could use some equipment.
[25:09.410 --> 25:13.410]  If you've got any old equipment that you're willing to donate or if you're going to throw it away or whatever,
[25:13.410 --> 25:15.410]  maybe we could give it to this veteran.
[25:15.410 --> 25:17.410]  So you can Craigslist may be a good spot to start.
[25:17.410 --> 25:19.410]  And then maybe Facebook.
[25:19.410 --> 25:23.410]  Maybe you could start a Facebook group for veterans in need of grow equipment
[25:23.410 --> 25:25.410]  or Veterans Cannabis Alliance or something.
[25:25.410 --> 25:26.410]  That's probably already taken.
[25:26.410 --> 25:28.410]  That came out too naturally.
[25:28.410 --> 25:32.410]  But some sort of veterans and cannabis and something to Veterans Grow Initiative,
[25:32.410 --> 25:33.410]  something like that.
[25:33.410 --> 25:34.410]  The GI Grow.
[25:34.410 --> 25:35.410]  There you go.
[25:35.410 --> 25:36.410]  The GI Grow.
[25:36.410 --> 25:39.410]  Something like that to get just to help get them some equipment.
[25:39.410 --> 25:41.410]  So maybe post something to Craigslist.
[25:41.410 --> 25:43.410]  Maybe social media like Facebook is always a place to start.
[25:43.410 --> 25:45.410]  Start a group on there.
[25:45.410 --> 25:47.410]  Then go invite all of your veteran friends.
[25:47.410 --> 25:50.410]  Then invite all of your grower friends.
[25:50.410 --> 25:52.410]  If you know any of the two, if you've got an overlap,
[25:52.410 --> 25:54.410]  that's a good way to get it started.
[25:54.410 --> 25:59.410]  Then maybe some of the dispensaries and grow stores have message boards
[25:59.410 --> 26:03.410]  where you can actually make a note on paper and put it on a bulletin board
[26:03.410 --> 26:05.410]  with these old things they call push pins.
[26:05.410 --> 26:06.410]  Yeah.
[26:06.410 --> 26:07.410]  Some places still have that.
[26:07.410 --> 26:10.410]  I know a lot of the music stores put that in the back so you can look for a band.
[26:10.410 --> 26:12.410]  Maybe some of the grow stores.
[26:12.410 --> 26:13.410]  Yeah.
[26:13.410 --> 26:14.410]  Yeah.
[26:14.410 --> 26:15.410]  So maybe you can go to the dispensary.
[26:15.410 --> 26:18.410]  Maybe you can go to the grow store and maybe put up a little flyer or something
[26:18.410 --> 26:19.410]  like that saying, hey, I know.
[26:19.410 --> 26:21.410]  Don't throw away that old grow gear.
[26:21.410 --> 26:23.410]  You buy a new gear, don't throw that old stuff away.
[26:23.410 --> 26:26.410]  Give it to a veteran in need and help a veteran grow some weed or something like that.
[26:26.410 --> 26:28.410]  Then just put your number on there or something.
[26:28.410 --> 26:30.410]  Then you can be the middleman.
[26:30.410 --> 26:34.410]  You just go collect all that gear and then you just take it to the vets as they need it.
[26:34.410 --> 26:40.410]  Or maybe you can find some veteran groups or maybe the VA hospital or something will help you out.
[26:40.410 --> 26:43.410]  Maybe if it's a legal medical cannabis market,
[26:43.410 --> 26:47.410]  a good place where I like to leave podcast advertising and business cards
[26:47.410 --> 26:49.410]  is the medical marijuana doctor.
[26:49.410 --> 26:54.410]  Every time I go there, I make sure to leave a couple of business cards there so they know you can hit me up for seeds
[26:54.410 --> 26:57.410]  and I leave podcast ads there because those are new consumers.
[26:57.410 --> 26:58.410]  They're getting their cards.
[26:58.410 --> 27:00.410]  I know they're going to smoke, possibly grow.
[27:00.410 --> 27:02.410]  So that's a great place to go.
[27:02.410 --> 27:07.410]  So I don't have a good strategy or plan for you, but I think social media
[27:07.410 --> 27:10.410]  and Craigslist are a great way to start this.
[27:10.410 --> 27:12.410]  Then like Mike said, just build your friends list.
[27:12.410 --> 27:15.410]  You're going to have to get out there and let people know what you're doing.
[27:15.410 --> 27:18.410]  Maybe you can do a thing with the grow store.
[27:18.410 --> 27:25.410]  Maybe you've got a friend at a local grow store who you can get them to give a discount,
[27:25.410 --> 27:28.410]  maybe 5% or 10% or maybe you get a free piece of merchandise,
[27:28.410 --> 27:31.410]  a little, you know, just a tiny freebie that people can get.
[27:31.410 --> 27:34.410]  If they contribute their old gear when they buy new gear,
[27:34.410 --> 27:38.410]  like bring your old light, get 10% off on your new light or something like that.
[27:38.410 --> 27:41.410]  Maybe you can get a store to run a special like that and help you out.
[27:41.410 --> 27:45.410]  I don't know if you've got friends or access like that, but that's when friends come into play.
[27:45.410 --> 27:47.410]  That's when stuff like this helps.
[27:47.410 --> 27:50.410]  Maybe you'll find that one of the grow stores in town is ran by an old veteran
[27:50.410 --> 27:52.410]  and he'll be like, oh, that's an amazing idea.
[27:52.410 --> 27:54.410]  Maybe he's got the same kind of passion that you do.
[27:54.410 --> 27:58.410]  Mike, I hear your stuff glitching out, so I'm going to slow down and let the recording catch up.
[27:58.410 --> 28:00.410]  Was your gear good, buddy?
[28:00.410 --> 28:03.410]  Yeah, I think we sound good. I just don't want to miss anything in the recording.
[28:03.410 --> 28:05.410]  It's still good on my end.
[28:05.410 --> 28:06.410]  Sweet.
[28:06.410 --> 28:10.410]  All right. So Carl, I think we have answered your question to the best of our ability.
[28:10.410 --> 28:14.410]  You're going to have to do some groundwork, maybe make some phone calls, social media,
[28:14.410 --> 28:17.410]  get out there and let people know what your mission is.
[28:17.410 --> 28:20.410]  And then once it starts happening, it will snowball.
[28:20.410 --> 28:24.410]  Once people know what you're doing, you start building a following, it will start flowing.
[28:24.410 --> 28:26.410]  That's all you got to do is get it rolling.
[28:26.410 --> 28:28.410]  So that's my advice. Get it started, bro.
[28:28.410 --> 28:32.410]  Maybe go make a Facebook group, create a Craigslist post, and then find people on both ends,
[28:32.410 --> 28:35.410]  needers and givers, and then make it happen.
[28:35.410 --> 28:37.410]  It'll be fun. It'll feel really good when you get it going.
[28:37.410 --> 28:39.410]  And thank you for this, bro. Thank you for taking initiative.
[28:39.410 --> 28:42.410]  And at least having the idea and some passion to get this going for us.
[28:42.410 --> 28:45.410]  I'm sure all of those veterans do appreciate your help.
[28:45.410 --> 28:48.410]  All right. Let's move into the next one.
[28:48.410 --> 28:50.410]  This one could get kind of long, but that's okay.
[28:50.410 --> 28:51.410]  I got all night.
[28:51.410 --> 28:52.410]  This message...
[28:52.410 --> 28:55.410]  Nice. Mike's in for the long haul.
[28:55.410 --> 28:56.410]  This one says,
[28:56.410 --> 28:57.410]  Hey, Ross to Jeff.
[28:57.410 --> 29:02.410]  They legalized recreational cannabis here in Maine in 2016.
[29:02.410 --> 29:07.410]  Since then, I've been very enthusiastically trying to learn everything I can about growing.
[29:07.410 --> 29:09.410]  Bro, there is a lot to learn. Keep sucking it in.
[29:09.410 --> 29:10.410]  It goes on to say,
[29:10.410 --> 29:14.410]  I've enjoyed the plant for a long time, but I was afraid to try growing when it was illegal.
[29:14.410 --> 29:17.410]  Smart move. That's a risky move sometimes.
[29:17.410 --> 29:18.410]  It says,
[29:18.410 --> 29:20.410]  I have a job where I can listen to headphones at work.
[29:20.410 --> 29:24.410]  So when they legalized, I began listening to podcasts about growing.
[29:24.410 --> 29:25.410]  That is the life.
[29:25.410 --> 29:27.410]  When you can just put in earbuds and just go all day.
[29:27.410 --> 29:28.410]  Smart choice.
[29:28.410 --> 29:32.410]  Yeah. I think I first discovered your podcast sometime around 2017 or 18.
[29:32.410 --> 29:38.410]  I began listening to blocks of early episodes on YouTube to learn and pass the time
[29:38.410 --> 29:39.410]  while at work.
[29:39.410 --> 29:43.410]  I went as far back as the I Grow Culture episodes.
[29:43.410 --> 29:44.410]  Nice.
[29:44.410 --> 29:46.410]  Yeah. So just an update.
[29:46.410 --> 29:49.410]  Yeah. When the podcast first started, I called it I Grow Culture.
[29:49.410 --> 29:53.410]  I'll play on the word agriculture and I grow because everything at the time had the I,
[29:53.410 --> 29:56.410]  I phone, I rig, I everything.
[29:56.410 --> 29:58.410]  So I wanted to play with that.
[29:58.410 --> 30:04.410]  Then I did get a message from a company who makes educational programs for schools
[30:04.410 --> 30:07.410]  and they were called the I Grow Culture Institute or something.
[30:07.410 --> 30:10.410]  And they're like, you can't do that anymore or we will sue you.
[30:10.410 --> 30:11.410]  And I was like, oh, cool.
[30:11.410 --> 30:13.410]  I wanted to change the name anyway.
[30:13.410 --> 30:14.410]  I didn't like that anymore.
[30:14.410 --> 30:17.410]  So in episode 50, we changed the name to grow from your heart.
[30:17.410 --> 30:19.410]  That's where the I Grow Culture part comes in.
[30:19.410 --> 30:22.410]  Now that you're caught up on history, it says,
[30:22.410 --> 30:25.410]  I heard your episode about how you named strains today.
[30:25.410 --> 30:26.410]  If you've been listening to the show,
[30:26.410 --> 30:28.410]  a recent episode was about how I named strains.
[30:28.410 --> 30:29.410]  Good episode.
[30:29.410 --> 30:30.410]  Thank you, bro.
[30:30.410 --> 30:31.410]  It goes on saying,
[30:31.410 --> 30:34.410]  I found myself agreeing with you that names of strains are important.
[30:34.410 --> 30:37.410]  I'm glad you give some thought to the names you choose.
[30:37.410 --> 30:41.410]  If I had one piece of advice to give people naming strains of cannabis,
[30:41.410 --> 30:45.410]  it would be try to pick something classy and creative.
[30:45.410 --> 30:46.410]  Yes.
[30:46.410 --> 30:49.410]  Something that stands out, something that doesn't scare people away.
[30:49.410 --> 30:57.410]  We often forget that the main demographic of cannabis is 18 to 40 year old bros.
[30:57.410 --> 31:01.410]  That's mostly who's smoking and mostly 25 to 40 year old bros.
[31:01.410 --> 31:03.410]  And not, that's just the demographic.
[31:03.410 --> 31:06.410]  If you look up cannabis study, that's who's mostly into it.
[31:06.410 --> 31:07.410]  There's the fringe.
[31:07.410 --> 31:09.410]  The older demographic is getting larger.
[31:09.410 --> 31:12.410]  The lady demographic is getting larger, but it's mostly bros.
[31:12.410 --> 31:14.410]  We forget that.
[31:14.410 --> 31:16.410]  We need to remember that there are ladies.
[31:16.410 --> 31:18.410]  There are older folks in here.
[31:18.410 --> 31:21.410]  There are not bros that are consuming cannabis now.
[31:21.410 --> 31:24.410]  This is becoming a popular commercial commodity.
[31:24.410 --> 31:26.410]  We need to not scare the ladies away.
[31:26.410 --> 31:30.410]  I had a close friend who is a lady grower tell me that she didn't like my
[31:30.410 --> 31:33.410]  strain bounty killer because of the name bounty killer.
[31:33.410 --> 31:36.410]  I named it after a reggae artist who was called bounty killer.
[31:36.410 --> 31:39.410]  And also it makes big fat harvests.
[31:39.410 --> 31:40.410]  So I thought it was appropriate.
[31:40.410 --> 31:43.410]  She said, I wish it had a better, more gentle name.
[31:43.410 --> 31:48.410]  So if we adjust, we may be able to get more ladies, more older folk into our demographic.
[31:48.410 --> 31:51.410]  A lot of, if you're a seed breeder, you're trying to sell,
[31:51.410 --> 31:52.410]  you got to broaden your audience.
[31:52.410 --> 31:53.410]  So let me get back on track here.
[31:53.410 --> 31:56.410]  It says, try to pick something classy and creative.
[31:56.410 --> 32:00.410]  It says don't pick names like green crack or donkey dick or crystal math.
[32:00.410 --> 32:02.410]  I fucking completely agree.
[32:02.410 --> 32:03.410]  Green crack is kind of,
[32:03.410 --> 32:08.410]  which makes me where the guy who named green crack had named it like
[32:08.410 --> 32:10.410]  strawberry starbursts or some shit.
[32:10.410 --> 32:13.410]  We to be legal in like three more States, right?
[32:13.410 --> 32:16.410]  And it may have been on more shelves and more dispensaries.
[32:16.410 --> 32:17.410]  I did get renamed.
[32:17.410 --> 32:19.410]  The name status back.
[32:19.410 --> 32:21.410]  It's yeah.
[32:21.410 --> 32:25.410]  Perception's a thing and it's, it's real and it has legit effects.
[32:25.410 --> 32:29.410]  Yeah. And if, uh, and now if you ever hear the word, uh, the mellow,
[32:29.410 --> 32:31.410]  that was green crack,
[32:31.410 --> 32:34.410]  they renamed it to the mellow after Carmelo Anthony,
[32:34.410 --> 32:37.410]  because green crack was his favorite strain is what I think I read.
[32:37.410 --> 32:39.410]  That's a weird nugget of cannabis info there.
[32:39.410 --> 32:42.410]  I don't pick names like green crack or donkey dick or crystal math.
[32:42.410 --> 32:43.410]  I agree.
[32:43.410 --> 32:47.410]  A donkey dick is kind of, maybe it made big giant buds, but still,
[32:47.410 --> 32:50.410]  and green crack was called green crack because it made little tiny rocks that
[32:50.410 --> 32:53.410]  were super hard and everybody wanted it.
[32:53.410 --> 32:54.410]  So it was green crack.
[32:54.410 --> 32:57.410]  The donkey dick makes big buds, crystal meth.
[32:57.410 --> 32:59.410]  Let's not do that.
[32:59.410 --> 33:00.410]  That's another drug.
[33:00.410 --> 33:01.410]  Let's not do that.
[33:01.410 --> 33:02.410]  Yeah.
[33:02.410 --> 33:04.410]  You don't even have to ever type those words together.
[33:04.410 --> 33:05.410]  Um,
[33:05.410 --> 33:09.410]  somebody recently asked me if I was going to make any COVID tribute strains
[33:09.410 --> 33:10.410]  and I was like, no, fuck that.
[33:10.410 --> 33:11.410]  It was like,
[33:11.410 --> 33:14.410]  I make strains after things I like like Ninja turtles and GI Joes and
[33:14.410 --> 33:16.410]  grocery rhymes after pandemics.
[33:16.410 --> 33:17.410]  Yeah.
[33:17.410 --> 33:18.410]  Yeah.
[33:18.410 --> 33:22.410]  So there will not be any COVID or any pandemic strain names coming out of my
[33:22.410 --> 33:23.410]  camp.
[33:23.410 --> 33:24.410]  So thank you.
[33:24.410 --> 33:25.410]  Uh, why honor that?
[33:25.410 --> 33:26.410]  Uh, so it keeps going.
[33:26.410 --> 33:27.410]  It says,
[33:27.410 --> 33:29.410]  why would anyone want to compare this wonderful plant with such a horrible
[33:29.410 --> 33:30.410]  drug?
[33:30.410 --> 33:31.410]  Like cracker meth,
[33:31.410 --> 33:34.410]  just the name green crack actually made me angry when I first heard of it.
[33:34.410 --> 33:36.410]  And it's still kind of pisses me off.
[33:36.410 --> 33:39.410]  I don't know that it pisses me off, but it does like rub me wrong.
[33:39.410 --> 33:41.410]  I don't want to hear people say that, like, just don't,
[33:41.410 --> 33:44.410]  don't say those words.
[33:44.410 --> 33:45.410]  It goes on to say,
[33:45.410 --> 33:48.410]  I think names like this work against cannabis being accepted and legalized
[33:48.410 --> 33:50.410]  in more places.
[33:50.410 --> 33:52.410]  Don't help those idiots to keep it illegal.
[33:52.410 --> 33:55.410]  Mike, you and I, you and this guy were on the exact same page.
[33:55.410 --> 33:57.410]  Then it says, don't give them fire.
[33:57.410 --> 33:58.410]  They got plenty.
[33:58.410 --> 33:59.410]  Exactly.
[33:59.410 --> 34:00.410]  Yeah.
[34:00.410 --> 34:01.410]  Yeah.
[34:01.410 --> 34:02.410]  I'm a white guy with dreadlocks.
[34:02.410 --> 34:04.410]  I have to speak clearly because if I went up and said, bro,
[34:04.410 --> 34:06.410]  they already expected that from me.
[34:06.410 --> 34:07.410]  So it says, here's the thing.
[34:07.410 --> 34:10.410]  Eventually I started hearing good things about green crack from some
[34:10.410 --> 34:11.410]  sources.
[34:11.410 --> 34:13.410]  So it got me thinking that maybe there were good strains out there,
[34:13.410 --> 34:16.410]  which I were avoiding simply because I thought the name was stupid or silly
[34:16.410 --> 34:18.410]  thinking about it more.
[34:18.410 --> 34:19.410]  I know there must be.
[34:19.410 --> 34:20.410]  Yeah.
[34:20.410 --> 34:23.410]  I'm sure that some strain names have scared me away.
[34:23.410 --> 34:26.410]  Maybe there were some great seeds that I didn't buy just because the name
[34:26.410 --> 34:28.410]  was stupid or something like that.
[34:28.410 --> 34:30.410]  I think that that is definitely a thing.
[34:30.410 --> 34:33.410]  So I'm glad that you agree with me that it's very important.
[34:33.410 --> 34:36.410]  Not only for marketing and for, as from a marketing standpoint point,
[34:36.410 --> 34:40.410]  but from a cultural and an observation standpoint,
[34:40.410 --> 34:43.410]  the people looking in on us like, well, they like to smoke green crack.
[34:43.410 --> 34:45.410]  It just doesn't fucking sound good.
[34:45.410 --> 34:47.410]  Doesn't sound good.
[34:47.410 --> 34:52.410]  One of the anti-pot groups here in Colorado has been desperate to get all
[34:52.410 --> 34:54.410]  sorts of, all concentrates.
[34:54.410 --> 34:57.410]  They want the, to double crack weed.
[34:57.410 --> 35:01.410]  It's been funny to watch them try to get this to catch on for the last four
[35:01.410 --> 35:05.410]  years.
[35:05.410 --> 35:08.410]  It's just some shit just won't catch on and all the shit catches on right
[35:08.410 --> 35:11.410]  away. And it's just, you can't force it.
[35:11.410 --> 35:13.410]  Kevin Jodry, Kevin Jodry,
[35:14.410 --> 35:18.410]  with tree base, tree base, tree base, tree base.
[35:18.410 --> 35:21.410]  Yeah, no, it's not going to set us forward at all.
[35:21.410 --> 35:24.410]  The optics of dabbing are very,
[35:24.410 --> 35:27.410]  very tricky to explain to non-consumers.
[35:27.410 --> 35:28.410]  Yeah.
[35:28.410 --> 35:31.410]  The first time you bust out that dab torch and you start heating up that
[35:31.410 --> 35:34.410]  nail, people like, um, so we smoking weed today or what are you doing over
[35:34.410 --> 35:35.410]  there?
[35:35.410 --> 35:37.410]  I just wanted to get stoned. I didn't want to do drugs.
[35:37.410 --> 35:38.410]  Yeah.
[35:38.410 --> 35:40.410]  I promise is just weed.
[35:40.410 --> 35:41.410]  You pulled out a blowtorch.
[35:41.410 --> 35:42.410]  Yeah.
[35:42.410 --> 35:44.410]  So they wrap up this message with, uh,
[35:44.410 --> 35:47.410]  thank you for sharing so much of your cannabis growing knowledge with the
[35:47.410 --> 35:49.410]  world signed Jim Owen.
[35:49.410 --> 35:52.410]  And then Jim politely reminds me that I can say his name because that's just
[35:52.410 --> 35:53.410]  a pen name.
[35:53.410 --> 35:55.410]  And then, uh, they sent me some pictures too.
[35:55.410 --> 35:58.410]  And that arise bud looked fucking amazing, dude.
[35:58.410 --> 36:00.410]  Great job. Great work, Jim.
[36:00.410 --> 36:01.410]  Thank you for the great message.
[36:01.410 --> 36:04.410]  I hope I addressed your question and concern.
[36:04.410 --> 36:05.410]  I feel like I did.
[36:05.410 --> 36:06.410]  Cause I completely agree with you.
[36:06.410 --> 36:07.410]  You guys, if you're breeding out there,
[36:08.410 --> 36:11.410]  you're making strains, uh, pick a cooler name, man.
[36:11.410 --> 36:13.410]  It doesn't need to be drug related.
[36:13.410 --> 36:15.410]  All the names in the world out there.
[36:15.410 --> 36:16.410]  Don't go with something.
[36:16.410 --> 36:19.410]  That's just going to give it a black guy right off the start.
[36:19.410 --> 36:23.410]  Yeah. But if you love it, do it, do your thing player, do your thing.
[36:23.410 --> 36:24.410]  All right, Mike.
[36:24.410 --> 36:27.410]  I feel like I've covered all of my notes for this episode of the show.
[36:27.410 --> 36:29.410]  Uh, I'd like to give you the opportunity to ramble.
[36:29.410 --> 36:32.410]  If you've got anything that you'd like to talk about today, if not,
[36:32.410 --> 36:34.410]  you don't have to force anything and please,
[36:34.410 --> 36:35.410]  Keep it on political.
[36:35.410 --> 36:39.410]  No, not, uh, not doing anything pandemic or politic related.
[36:39.410 --> 36:41.410]  Just, uh, um,
[36:41.410 --> 36:45.410]  I feel like this has been my little Mike's moment three or four times in a
[36:45.410 --> 36:50.410]  row, but I went herb shopping again at a bunch of local shops and man,
[36:50.410 --> 36:51.410]  trim your fucking weed.
[36:51.410 --> 36:52.410]  Oh yeah.
[36:52.410 --> 36:57.410]  Um, also if marijuana is legal where you're at and you're willing to
[36:57.410 --> 36:58.410]  do it,
[36:58.410 --> 36:59.410]  you're willing to do it.
[36:59.410 --> 37:00.410]  You're willing to do it.
[37:00.410 --> 37:05.410]  If marijuana is legal where you're at and you're wondering about how to
[37:05.410 --> 37:09.410]  attract more consumers to your business,
[37:09.410 --> 37:13.410]  the trick is to put good products at reasonable prices on the shelves.
[37:14.410 --> 37:18.410]  Like that's, I don't want to give away the secret to business for free,
[37:19.410 --> 37:20.410]  but there it fucking is.
[37:20.410 --> 37:23.410]  People put good herb on the shelf at a reasonable price.
[37:24.410 --> 37:26.410]  If you build it, they will come.
[37:26.410 --> 37:27.410]  That's the truth.
[37:27.410 --> 37:28.410]  That's the truth.
[37:28.410 --> 37:32.410]  Quit focusing on random crazy products and weird advertising tactics and
[37:32.410 --> 37:36.410]  fucking fancy artwork on the sides of your building and put some cool product
[37:36.410 --> 37:37.410]  on the shelf and we will come by it.
[37:38.410 --> 37:40.410]  Put good urban, put good herb on the shelf.
[37:40.410 --> 37:42.410]  That's that's really all you gotta do.
[37:42.410 --> 37:43.410]  Excellent.
[37:43.410 --> 37:44.410]  Mike, I appreciate that insight.
[37:44.410 --> 37:45.410]  That shit.
[37:45.410 --> 37:48.410]  That was much different than what your Twitter feed has been like lately.
[37:48.410 --> 37:49.410]  So I'm glad you went that route.
[37:49.410 --> 37:52.410]  Um, yeah, my, my Twitter feed has been interesting.
[37:52.410 --> 37:55.410]  And if you're looking for a more violent, a militant version of white,
[37:55.410 --> 37:57.410]  check out at Nemo punk 15 on Twitter.
[37:57.410 --> 37:59.410]  And how do we find you on Facebook?
[37:59.410 --> 38:02.410]  Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws, but, uh,
[38:02.410 --> 38:05.410]  it's been pretty quiet lately because I haven't felt much like Facebook
[38:05.410 --> 38:06.410]  ranting lately.
[38:06.410 --> 38:09.410]  I've had to just kind of stay off of Facebook lately.
[38:11.410 --> 38:12.410]  I'm almost done with it.
[38:13.410 --> 38:15.410]  I'm, I'm flirting with being done.
[38:15.410 --> 38:19.410]  I, uh, I've kind of stopped posting photos and that's what I used it for was
[38:20.410 --> 38:23.410]  keeping family updated on kids stuff and family stuff.
[38:23.410 --> 38:24.410]  Um,
[38:24.410 --> 38:28.410]  but I stopped because I don't want to come across photos of my kids using
[38:28.410 --> 38:31.410]  promotional advertising for products somewhere else because that's how
[38:31.410 --> 38:32.410]  Facebook works.
[38:33.410 --> 38:36.410]  Like if you have a Facebook account, you're the fucking product.
[38:37.410 --> 38:39.410]  That's how social media works.
[38:39.410 --> 38:44.410]  So I've been posting less and less, especially imagery and yeah,
[38:45.410 --> 38:46.410]  it's evil.
[38:46.410 --> 38:49.410]  Just go post random fish lyrics just to let people know what I was listening
[38:49.410 --> 38:50.410]  to in the car.
[38:50.410 --> 38:53.410]  That's usually what that nonsense, that four nonsensical words in a row,
[38:53.410 --> 38:54.410]  usually fish lyrics.
[38:54.410 --> 38:58.410]  Every time I post song lyrics, I get three private messages that are like,
[38:58.410 --> 38:59.410]  are you okay, bro?
[39:01.410 --> 39:02.410]  We listen to different music.
[39:03.410 --> 39:06.410]  I'm avoiding social media because in the, in the growing groups,
[39:06.410 --> 39:08.410]  I see the craziest stuff.
[39:08.410 --> 39:11.410]  And so the growing groups are just so toxic.
[39:11.410 --> 39:13.410]  I don't have time to correct all of that shit.
[39:13.410 --> 39:16.410]  So I just click back out and I'm done with it for a minute.
[39:16.410 --> 39:18.410]  Come to a podcast and talk about real stuff.
[39:18.410 --> 39:20.410]  Instead of trying to feel all that nonsense there.
[39:20.410 --> 39:23.410]  That's what inspired the, uh, the outdoor episode last time.
[39:24.410 --> 39:27.410]  Yeah. I liked that rant. It, uh, um,
[39:28.410 --> 39:32.410]  the key to a good grow is planning in, in prep work.
[39:33.410 --> 39:37.410]  And then just consistency. It's, if you're going to grow a plant,
[39:38.410 --> 39:40.410]  it's like growing anything else that's alive.
[39:40.410 --> 39:43.410]  It requires daily active work.
[39:43.410 --> 39:47.410]  And if you forget about it or you don't put a lot of effort in upfront,
[39:47.410 --> 39:49.410]  so your, your gear doesn't run right,
[39:49.410 --> 39:53.410]  or doesn't work well together or doesn't fit in your space or parts of it
[39:53.410 --> 39:57.410]  don't work, you're going to end up with shit.
[39:57.410 --> 39:58.410]  And it's going to cost you money.
[39:59.410 --> 40:03.410]  If you put a little prep work into it and do your research and then put in
[40:03.410 --> 40:07.410]  your due diligence every day, you're going to grow fire. Yes.
[40:07.410 --> 40:08.410]  This is how it works.
[40:08.410 --> 40:12.410]  If you put a little prep work into it and do your research and then put in
[40:12.410 --> 40:15.410]  your due diligence every day, you're going to grow fire. Yes.
[40:15.410 --> 40:16.410]  This is how it works.
[40:16.410 --> 40:19.410]  If you did the proper research and put genetics that were worth a shit
[40:19.410 --> 40:21.410]  outside or in your growth. Yes. Yeah.
[40:21.410 --> 40:25.410]  Yeah. The plan. I, uh, I can't believe there are still,
[40:27.410 --> 40:31.410]  like there's, there's so much information now when you and me first got into
[40:31.410 --> 40:36.410]  cannabis, there were one or two grow books and they were like
[40:39.410 --> 40:41.410]  mythical. Yeah. Uh, the,
[40:41.410 --> 40:44.410]  the only difference I can think of from pop culture is in the first American
[40:44.410 --> 40:48.410]  pie. There's the book of how to fuck that they have to go get from under the
[40:48.410 --> 40:53.410]  library shelf. It was like trying to find the anarchist cookbook. Yeah. Yeah.
[40:53.410 --> 40:55.410]  Um, but, uh,
[40:57.410 --> 41:02.410]  you had to take sketchy advice and then the first internet forums like roll it
[41:02.410 --> 41:03.410]  up and whatnot.
[41:03.410 --> 41:07.410]  You never knew if you were talking to someone who was trying to help you out.
[41:08.410 --> 41:11.410]  If you were talking to a competitor who was trying to get you to fuck up
[41:11.410 --> 41:15.410]  yourself so that you wouldn't eat up any market share,
[41:15.410 --> 41:17.410]  or if you were talking to a cop who was trying to arrest you,
[41:17.410 --> 41:19.410]  like you had no idea. Yeah. Um,
[41:20.410 --> 41:25.410]  and so it was so much harder to find good advice, but now it's so easy.
[41:25.410 --> 41:27.410]  If you just do your homework a little bit,
[41:28.410 --> 41:32.410]  you can get a good idea of which pieces of equipment you need,
[41:32.410 --> 41:34.410]  how to set them up, um,
[41:34.410 --> 41:38.410]  what to feed your plants on what kind of schedule and you're going to be
[41:38.410 --> 41:43.410]  moderately successful. If you just put in the work, please put in the work.
[41:43.410 --> 41:44.410]  Yes. He's so much better.
[41:46.410 --> 41:50.410]  Just get a book, read a book. Like it's weird how many people like get plants.
[41:50.410 --> 41:53.410]  And then like day four, like what should I have done on day one? I'm like, Oh,
[41:53.410 --> 41:56.410]  you're already fucking up, dude. You're already behind everything.
[41:56.410 --> 42:00.410]  You got to go to driver's ed before you get in the car and stomp on the pedals.
[42:01.410 --> 42:04.410]  Um, and then three guys in the chat, give them like, you should talk that.
[42:04.410 --> 42:06.410]  You need to talk that plant right now. And I'm like,
[42:06.410 --> 42:08.410]  topping it's not going to do anything for the CalMag deficiency.
[42:08.410 --> 42:10.410]  Like what the fuck are you talking about?
[42:10.410 --> 42:13.410]  The number of people that are like, add piss. Yeah.
[42:14.410 --> 42:16.410]  Why? Why? What, what, what, what?
[42:17.410 --> 42:20.410]  It's not fucking getting rid of athletes foot. What the fuck are you doing?
[42:20.410 --> 42:24.410]  The solution to everything in Facebook is either more CalMag or spray it with
[42:24.410 --> 42:29.410]  neem or now it's Dr. Zime. Dr. Zime is the new one, but yeah.
[42:30.410 --> 42:34.410]  Anyway, that cracks my shit up. I see posts that started off with,
[42:34.410 --> 42:37.410]  I already added CalMag. So fucking go to step two already.
