[00:01.020 --> 00:06.220]  Yeah, what's up, podcast world? It's your boy Rasta Jeff coming to you live from the
[00:06.220 --> 00:11.360]  car on Interstate 25. That's right. I just left the Champs Trade Show. I thought it'd
[00:11.360 --> 00:16.360]  be a good idea to jump on the microphone and do a little bit of recording while it's still
[00:16.360 --> 00:21.960]  fresh in my mind. So today I went to the Champs Trade Show in Denver. It was a beautiful drive.
[00:21.960 --> 00:27.260]  It takes me about two hours to get up to Denver. It took me about another 20 minutes to find
[00:27.260 --> 00:32.440]  a good parking spot. Anyway, I got a good parking spot. I messaged a good friend of
[00:32.440 --> 00:37.100]  mine who had a pass for me. We met up and he got me a pass for Champs. He gave me a
[00:37.100 --> 00:40.820]  high five and told me to have a good time. He had shit to do. So he sent me on my way
[00:40.820 --> 00:47.100]  and I headed into the Champs Trade Show. You guys, I am failing you right now because I
[00:47.100 --> 00:51.860]  seriously don't know what Champs stands for. Champs is an acronym for something. I don't
[00:51.860 --> 00:56.140]  know what it means. C-H-A-M-P-S. It means something about glass and trade show because
[00:56.220 --> 01:05.100]  what it was was a trade show based on glass, cannabis. Some of that shit said for tobacco
[01:05.100 --> 01:13.300]  use only, but tobacco and cannabis smoking accessories. I saw... So basically it's all
[01:13.300 --> 01:17.260]  your shit that is available at all the head shops that you go to depending on the quality
[01:17.260 --> 01:23.620]  of your head shop. But it was all there. All that plastic shitty Chinese smoking accessory
[01:23.620 --> 01:28.860]  stuff was all there. All the shitty Chinese knockoff glass was there. All of the shitty
[01:28.860 --> 01:34.340]  knockoff nail companies were there, but also some of our good friends were there. You guys,
[01:34.340 --> 01:40.100]  I got to visit the Hitman booth. If I was a man, if I didn't walk away from the Hitman
[01:40.100 --> 01:44.740]  booth today, I was going to spend a lot of money with Hitman. They had two rigs that
[01:44.740 --> 01:49.060]  I was really interested in. They had the mini, they have the new, I forget what they call
[01:49.060 --> 01:53.100]  them. They call them a Sunday stack or something like that. It's not the Sunday cup, but it's
[01:53.100 --> 01:57.740]  this little stack thing, the mini stack. Holy shit. They had water in it. They let
[01:57.740 --> 02:01.260]  me pull through it. That thing felt like it would hit like a champ. Unfortunately, you
[02:01.260 --> 02:06.460]  guys, there was no consumption in this venue. We were not allowed to smoke any type of cannabis.
[02:06.460 --> 02:13.300]  We couldn't dab. There was actually somebody pressing out rosin dabs. He had a rosin press.
[02:13.300 --> 02:18.180]  If you know about rosin, it's made by squishing your buds between two heated surfaces using
[02:18.180 --> 02:22.660]  parchment in the middle as some way to catch your hash. He was pressing out rosin right
[02:22.660 --> 02:26.060]  there for you so you could bring your nugs and get them squished is what they were calling
[02:26.060 --> 02:29.900]  it. Some people were taking dabs of that right after they would squish it, although it was
[02:29.900 --> 02:34.700]  frowned upon. If you got caught, they would escort you out of the building. Anyway, I
[02:34.700 --> 02:39.460]  met up with the Hitman crew. I fell in love with a couple of rigs. They had a mini sidecar
[02:39.460 --> 02:44.700]  rig with a blue label. The blue label was beautiful. It's my favorite color, my exact
[02:44.700 --> 02:49.060]  favorite color blue. Unfortunately, I just bought the same rig with a yellow label, so
[02:49.060 --> 02:54.420]  I could not bring myself to spend another $150 on a rig. Although $150 on that rig was
[02:54.420 --> 02:59.820]  a steal, I just didn't want to buy a copy of a rig that I have already got. It did not
[02:59.820 --> 03:03.540]  make sense to me. Anyway, so I had to walk away before I bought the Sunday Stack and
[03:03.540 --> 03:08.340]  before I bought the blue mini sidecar. They had a bunch of great rigs at the Hitman booth.
[03:08.340 --> 03:16.380]  Also I made friends with a bunch of people. I also got to bump into our crew with Oil
[03:16.380 --> 03:20.740]  Slick. Josh from Oil Slick and the Oil Slick crew was there in full force. They sent me
[03:20.740 --> 03:25.460]  home with a sample of the, I forget the official name of it. I've been calling it the bong
[03:25.460 --> 03:30.420]  condom. It's actually a, it's basically a condom you put on the mouthpiece of your bong
[03:30.420 --> 03:34.540]  so that if you're at a large party or an event, you can swap those out so that not everybody
[03:34.540 --> 03:39.300]  has to get the, we call it the cup cough or the wook flu. So they gave me a couple of
[03:39.300 --> 03:43.500]  those to check out. Right across from our friends at Oil Slick was our good friends
[03:43.500 --> 03:48.020]  at Handmade Apparel. Big shout out to the entire Handmade and Oil Slick family. Thanks
[03:48.020 --> 03:51.940]  for coming out to Colorado. Thanks for showing everybody how to run a booth at Champs because
[03:51.940 --> 03:55.820]  you guys do it right. You guys are great people, great people in the industry, great service.
[03:55.820 --> 04:01.740]  So you guys make sure you support Oil Slick and Handmade Apparel and also Hitman Glass.
[04:01.740 --> 04:07.580]  Also I made a little stop at the Highly Educated Titanium little booth there and I picked up
[04:07.580 --> 04:11.940]  a couple of Highly Educated Titanium products. Tasked was not in the building but he had
[04:11.940 --> 04:16.380]  his cronies working for him. They do a great job so shout out to those guys. Make sure
[04:16.380 --> 04:20.700]  you support Highly Educated Titanium. I know it sounds like a big bunch of shout outs but
[04:20.700 --> 04:23.980]  I was at an event where there were a bunch of vendors you guys so these guys took care
[04:23.980 --> 04:28.940]  of me. They're products that I support so shout out to all of them. So it's basically
[04:28.940 --> 04:34.140]  you guys, it's a big swap meet of supplies for your head shop. I saw every kind of pipe
[04:34.140 --> 04:40.820]  and bong and hash rig and nail you could imagine. Every type of hash container you could imagine.
[04:40.820 --> 04:44.900]  There was not a lot of growing accessories or grow supplies or anything like that. It
[04:44.900 --> 04:51.060]  was all basically aimed at supplying your head shop with good quality glass. So I've
[04:51.060 --> 04:55.340]  got a list of people here that I got to hang out with today. Before I even open up the
[04:55.340 --> 05:00.540]  list I don't even need to think about it. As I walked out of my car, I walked up to
[05:00.540 --> 05:04.540]  the, no as soon as I walked into the event I was greeted by a guy by the name of Scott
[05:04.540 --> 05:08.080]  Reach. He walked up to me and shook my hand and asked how I was doing. You guys that is
[05:08.080 --> 05:12.720]  rare dankness, one of the most popular seed companies in the world right now. For Scott
[05:12.720 --> 05:16.880]  to walk up and know who I was kind of blew my mind to tell you the truth. I got a few
[05:16.880 --> 05:23.040]  feet into the building and then I ran into the man himself, the kosher stoner, Adam Macadoshus,
[05:23.040 --> 05:27.280]  our good friend Adam Ill. Big shout out to Adam Ill. It was good seeing Adam Ill. I got
[05:27.280 --> 05:31.160]  to hang out with Adam for a few minutes, have a quick conversation. Adam was hungry so he
[05:31.160 --> 05:35.200]  took off. We were supposed to link up for Terps later. We'll talk more about that. I
[05:35.200 --> 05:41.600]  ended up having to drive home. I didn't have to drive home. Dinner was at 7. It was 7 o'clock.
[05:41.600 --> 05:44.880]  We were still at Hunt's house taking dabs. I figured we weren't going to dinner until
[05:44.880 --> 05:48.760]  7.30 which means I would have been there until 8. Or no, I would have been there until 9,
[05:48.760 --> 05:52.560]  maybe 9.30. It's a two hour drive from there. That would have put me home around 11.30 or
[05:52.560 --> 05:55.400]  midnight. I couldn't deal with that. I've got to work in the morning so I had to split
[05:55.400 --> 06:00.160]  out from dinner. But anyway, shout out to John Hunt. Shout out to Adam Ill. Shout out
[06:00.160 --> 06:04.920]  to Carly. Big shout out to everybody who invited me to dinner. I apologize for not being able
[06:04.920 --> 06:09.920]  to make it next time guys for sure. I went to Champs today on a whim. I wasn't even supposed
[06:09.920 --> 06:13.360]  to go to Champs. This was a poorly planned trip. But I'm going to call it a hell of a
[06:13.360 --> 06:19.320]  success you guys. So I was walking through Champs and I spied one of the most beautiful
[06:19.320 --> 06:27.080]  women I have ever laid my eyes upon. The lovely Miss Charlotte Green was in the building.
[06:27.080 --> 06:33.480]  If you guys don't know who Charlotte Green is, she is a cannabis activist from Alaska.
[06:33.560 --> 06:38.840]  She's actually the lady who is known for saying, fuck it, I quit on the news. She was at Champs.
[06:38.840 --> 06:44.720]  She was here in Denver. Oh my gosh, you guys. Usually I am cool, calm and collected. I am
[06:44.720 --> 06:48.480]  a smooth motherfucker. I'm not afraid to talk to anybody. I'll walk up to anybody and say
[06:48.480 --> 06:54.040]  hello. I'll walk into the restricted access area and act like I own that shit. I'm not
[06:54.040 --> 06:58.840]  a shy guy. But for some reason when I saw Miss Charlotte Green, something inside of
[06:58.840 --> 07:05.960]  me fucking melted. You guys, Charlotte is more beautiful in person than she has ever
[07:05.960 --> 07:10.600]  looked online, on Facebook, on the internet, on Twitter, on Instagram, whatever you saw
[07:10.600 --> 07:16.880]  her on. She is even more beautiful in person and her personality is sassy and stunning.
[07:16.880 --> 07:21.400]  So I'm walking toward her and she spotted me and she reached out and put her hand on
[07:21.400 --> 07:27.000]  my shoulder and said, hey you. And she knew who I was, which was kind of weird. I've stalked
[07:27.000 --> 07:31.280]  her on Facebook and said hello, but she has no reason to know who Rasta Jeff is. So I
[07:31.280 --> 07:34.160]  was a little excited by that. That made me a little spellbound. It made me feel like
[07:34.160 --> 07:39.320]  a high school boy. So I stopped and I asked her if I could give her a hug and she said,
[07:39.320 --> 07:43.200]  oh, of course. And we talked for a couple of minutes and you guys, I went stupid. I
[07:43.200 --> 07:48.200]  did not have shit proper to say to that beautiful lady. I couldn't decide if I wanted to just
[07:48.200 --> 07:52.320]  be like a normal dude and talk to her or if I wanted to go into like business guy mode
[07:52.320 --> 07:58.640]  or if I wanted to be podcast guy. My brain fluttered. That woman is beautiful. Oh my
[07:58.640 --> 08:01.960]  God. So big shout out to Charlotte Green. If you listen to this, yes, I'm gushing over
[08:01.960 --> 08:05.840]  you. You're the most beautiful damn woman I have seen in a long time. Holy shit. Blew
[08:05.840 --> 08:10.680]  my mind, honey. She's tall. You guys, I'm six foot five. Of course she was wearing some
[08:10.680 --> 08:13.800]  heels, but she is tall. Hold on. There's a cop right next to me. He might pull me over.
[08:13.800 --> 08:17.560]  Yes, I am talking into a microphone while driving down the interstate. This cop is right
[08:17.560 --> 08:21.320]  next to me. You guys, he's like staring at me. He's like, what are you doing? Oh, he
[08:21.320 --> 08:26.120]  didn't pull me over. That was awesome. Okay. Anyway, Charlotte Green, I'm six foot five.
[08:26.120 --> 08:29.800]  Charlotte Green of course was wearing some heels, but she was nearly as tall as me. I
[08:29.800 --> 08:33.160]  posted a selfie to Instagram and you guys will be able to see if you check that out.
[08:33.160 --> 08:37.720]  Check it out. It's at I read genetics on Instagram. She is tall. And I said, damn, honey, you were
[08:37.720 --> 08:41.320]  tall. And I put my armor on her. We took a selfie and she goes, I'm a big girl and I
[08:41.320 --> 08:46.200]  love it. And I said, me too. And I went silent. I was like, well, I've got a shop down in
[08:46.200 --> 08:49.560]  Pueblo. You should come check that out. And if I see you at the party later tonight, we'll
[08:49.560 --> 08:53.320]  dab. And of course I'm not going to the party because I do have to work in the morning.
[08:53.320 --> 08:58.200]  I was really thinking about going to the party, but, uh, I can't, it'll kill me. I will hate
[08:58.200 --> 09:01.640]  life tomorrow. And I've got to be a productive dude. I've got shit to handle trying to be
[09:01.640 --> 09:05.720]  a grown ass man. So, uh, let's see. I've got a list of people that I wanted to make sure
[09:05.720 --> 09:10.680]  I gave a shout out to, uh, we covered hunt, hunt, John hunt. You're a bad motherfucker.
[09:10.680 --> 09:15.080]  You are the Terp gatherer. You are, uh, man, you're the brother dude. You're the man. I
[09:15.080 --> 09:19.540]  like it. Big shout out, much respect to John hunt, the Grammy Gatsby. That's my boy. That's
[09:19.540 --> 09:24.580]  my partner in crime. Uh, I like hanging out with that dude. He, uh, he kind of encouraged
[09:24.580 --> 09:29.060]  me to come up to champs. He let me, uh, hang out. Uh, he kind of encouraged it. He kind
[09:29.060 --> 09:31.940]  of made it happen. It's your fault. He let me hang out at the house afterward and stop
[09:31.940 --> 09:35.780]  and take some dabs at the Terp station. Uh, thanks for letting me come to the dojo, bro.
[09:35.780 --> 09:39.540]  I appreciate it. Shout out to hunt. Also shout out to Adam mill. If you guys don't know Adam
[09:39.540 --> 09:44.420]  ill, uh, you got to learn about Adam ill, Adam ill. Uh, he had a podcast. I don't think
[09:44.420 --> 09:49.220]  he's doing that. He's now working with be real on be real TV. So Adam mill, the guy
[09:49.220 --> 09:53.140]  that goes, what? Make sure you check him out. He's cool. That's my homie. Shout out to Adam
[09:53.140 --> 09:57.220]  ill, uh, Terp champ. Who else do we got on the list? I am driving you guys. We got hit
[09:57.220 --> 10:02.580]  man. We got oil slick. We got handmade apparel. Uh, we got highly educated titanium. We gave
[10:02.580 --> 10:06.660]  a big shout out to Charlotte green. God, I just want to take a second to think about
[10:06.660 --> 10:11.060]  that one. Shout out Charlotte. All right. Also a big shout out to Tim and Zach and the
[10:11.060 --> 10:16.420]  entire crew from New Mexico. You guys, my friend Tim, uh, is from New Mexico. He's part
[10:16.420 --> 10:20.900]  of the New Mexico medical marijuana movement. My friend Zach is a patient today. I met their
[10:20.900 --> 10:24.420]  grower and another one of their friends. I can't remember both of their names. One dude
[10:24.420 --> 10:27.700]  was named Cedar. The other guy, his name is left my head. It was a normal guy name. I want
[10:27.700 --> 10:32.020]  to say possibly Tyler, but it's been a while and I've taken a few dabs. His name has left my head.
[10:32.020 --> 10:35.700]  I apologize. It's fucking rude, but shout out to those guys. They were a lot of fun to hang out
[10:35.700 --> 10:39.700]  with. Uh, they got me into the event. We got to hang out for a little bit and I will probably
[10:39.700 --> 10:44.500]  see them on their way home because I live between Denver and New Mexico. So stop in and take some
[10:44.500 --> 10:51.060]  dabs. You guys, I can't wait. Let's see, dude. I bumped into a young man by the name of Tim Martin.
[10:51.060 --> 10:56.660]  Uh, Tim Martin is the host of the John Doe radio show. Uh, if you don't listen to the JDR John Doe
[10:56.660 --> 11:01.940]  radio show, give that a listen. Uh, yes, I am shouting out another cannabis podcast, but we are
[11:01.940 --> 11:06.020]  not competing. We are friends. We do totally different shows. They're from Denver. I'm from
[11:06.020 --> 11:10.260]  Pueblo. We have different views on things. Uh, we, we agree on a lot of things, but I'm just saying
[11:10.260 --> 11:14.420]  it's two totally different shows. So there's no competition. I fully support what Tim Martin is
[11:14.420 --> 11:18.820]  doing. Tim Martin's a great dude. Tim and I actually talked about doing a couple of shows together.
[11:18.820 --> 11:23.300]  So in the very near future, I will be traveling back to Denver. I will be on the John Doe radio
[11:23.300 --> 11:27.780]  show. Stay tuned for that. I'll let you know when it happens. You can listen. Also, we will get Tim
[11:27.780 --> 11:32.820]  Martin to come be on the grow from your heart podcast. You guys, now that I've got the zoom H6,
[11:32.820 --> 11:39.140]  I feel like I can take the show anywhere. I did not record anything today. I felt rude. Uh, I didn't
[11:39.140 --> 11:42.500]  even think about taking my gear in there because it felt rude walking around. I just wanted to say
[11:42.500 --> 11:47.780]  hi to my friends and hang out and not be that interview guy. Uh, in the future, I will do that.
[11:47.780 --> 11:51.700]  If there's a two day event, I'll walk around one day and be friendly. I'll walk around the next
[11:51.700 --> 11:55.060]  day with a microphone. It was more fun just catching up with the crew this time. You guys.
[11:55.060 --> 12:00.660]  So big shout out to Tim Martin. Make sure you guys support John Doe radio. I don't know where
[12:00.660 --> 12:05.700]  to tell you to go look for that. It's probably on iTunes. The conversation that him and I had today
[12:06.260 --> 12:11.860]  leads me to believe that his podcast is on iTunes. All right. Who else do we own? I owe a shout out
[12:11.860 --> 12:16.740]  to you guys. I bumped into a glass blower. He's my friend. He's from North Carolina. He now resides
[12:16.740 --> 12:21.940]  in the great city of Pueblo, Colorado. He is a glass blower that is on the rise on Instagram.
[12:21.940 --> 12:27.300]  He is known as at barefoot glass. Uh, his name's will. He's a great dude. Make sure you support
[12:27.300 --> 12:31.700]  that guy. I am going to get him and his friend Blake on the podcast. We were going to talk about
[12:31.700 --> 12:35.940]  glass blowing the glass blowing industry. I plan on having that dude on the show. That is going to
[12:35.940 --> 12:40.020]  be great. It's a big shout out to my buddy. Will at barefoot glass for hanging out with me,
[12:40.020 --> 12:43.780]  entertaining me for a few minutes at the event. That was a good time. Always good to see will.
[12:43.780 --> 12:47.700]  What up? Well, I hope you listen, bro. Shout out, shout out to your bro that I met. Also,
[12:47.700 --> 12:52.020]  I want to remember that his name was Blake, but like I said earlier, that was several hours and
[12:52.020 --> 12:55.940]  several dabs ago. I'm trying to get you guys my review of champs. Well, it's a little bit fresh
[12:55.940 --> 13:01.860]  in my head and it's also filled with shout outs. Uh, one more important shout out. I was walking
[13:01.860 --> 13:08.260]  through, uh, the event and I came across a young man who calls himself Fox extracts. What up Fox?
[13:08.260 --> 13:11.780]  I hope you listen to the podcast. It was great meeting you and your lovely girlfriend and your
[13:11.780 --> 13:17.460]  puppy. Big scratch to the puppy on their tummy. Scratch that dog. Um, Fox has a lot of great
[13:17.460 --> 13:21.220]  shit coming up with CBD. You guys, we talked about something for about a minute and it had me
[13:21.780 --> 13:27.700]  intrigued. Fox is now in Colorado. He's in Colorado Springs one time this week and I am going to do my
[13:27.700 --> 13:33.140]  best to link up with him and get him to talk into a microphone for you and share you some ideas that
[13:33.140 --> 13:37.540]  he's got. He's got some amazing shit happening. I cannot wait for you guys to get to hear it.
[13:38.180 --> 13:43.140]  So I think that's all of the shout outs I've got. Um, a guy gave me an edible to try,
[13:43.140 --> 13:47.620]  but I'm not going to do a shout out on that or any review until I'm able to sit down and look
[13:47.620 --> 13:52.740]  at the packaging and eat it. Right now I'm driving on interstate 25 going about 70 miles an
[13:52.740 --> 13:56.900]  hour. There's nobody else out on the interstate. It's just me. Uh, it's a Wednesday night. It's
[13:56.900 --> 14:00.900]  pretty mellow. I'm actually driving through monument right now. Shout out to the city of
[14:00.900 --> 14:05.060]  monument and shout out to that cop that didn't pull me over a few miles back. I'm full on talking
[14:05.060 --> 14:10.020]  into a microphone and that cop did not pull me over. That's pretty killer. So let's see. I think
[14:10.020 --> 14:14.180]  I've done all these shout outs. I apologize if I missed anybody. Uh, it's nothing personal. Big
[14:14.180 --> 14:20.500]  shout out to Adam hand, uh, for throwing me a pin. Big shout out to, uh, everybody that I hung
[14:20.500 --> 14:23.860]  out with today. I apologize if I skipped you. I want to move on to this next part. You guys,
[14:23.860 --> 14:32.260]  I was gifted from a vendor, a G pin mini disposable is called the G pin disposable vaporizer. Uh,
[14:32.260 --> 14:37.060]  it's got a battery already in it. You're supposed to use it until it dies and then you're supposed
[14:37.060 --> 14:42.740]  to throw it away. So it's got instructions of press the button five times to turn it on,
[14:42.740 --> 14:47.780]  unscrew the mouthpiece, loads load with your desired. Uh, I think it said essential oil is
[14:47.780 --> 14:51.700]  what it said on the packaging. Uh, and then it said screw on the cap and then it said,
[14:51.700 --> 14:57.540]  press the button and inhale. So I was gifted this. It's a yellow G pin disposable. It's the
[14:57.540 --> 15:02.340]  concentrate version. I have followed the instructions. I unscrewed, I loaded, uh,
[15:02.340 --> 15:06.500]  I turned it on, I screwed it back together. Now you guys, we are going to press the button and
[15:06.500 --> 15:12.260]  we're going to inhale and we're going to see what kind of draws we get off of the G pin disposable.
[15:12.340 --> 15:27.280]  Let's check it out right now. Here we go. So it's dead silent. I know it's shitty for podcasting, but
[15:29.120 --> 15:34.800]  um, I loaded it with New York city diesel live resin that I got from Spence from the garden of
[15:34.800 --> 15:39.280]  Wheaton. Big shout out to Spence and it tastes really good, but honestly I didn't get a bit of
[15:39.280 --> 15:42.960]  smoke. It's lighting up like it should. Let's try this again. Let's give it another pull.
[15:55.060 --> 16:00.260]  So honestly I just got some hash in my mouth, which tastes really good, but there's no smoke
[16:01.220 --> 16:04.980]  and it's not working the way that you would really expect a hash pin to work.
[16:06.180 --> 16:09.780]  I packed it down properly. It comes with a little, uh, little poker so you can,
[16:09.780 --> 16:13.860]  Oh, I got live resin in my mouth. Uh, I came with a little poker so that you could pack it down in
[16:13.860 --> 16:17.940]  there and it's packed down in there. It's pressed against the coil. I've used plenty of hash pins in
[16:17.940 --> 16:23.780]  my day and this one so far two hits in, I'm ready to throw it out the fucking window. If I hadn't
[16:23.780 --> 16:27.860]  loaded it up with some decent New York city live resin, it would be out the window of the car by
[16:27.860 --> 16:32.500]  now. So what I'm going to do, I'm going to hold it, uh, upright to where the hash will melt into
[16:32.500 --> 16:37.540]  the coil when I press the button and I'm going to let it melt for a couple of seconds. I'm doing
[16:37.540 --> 16:42.980]  that. It's lit up. It seems to be doing its thing. So now I'm hoping that I've melted the hash down
[16:42.980 --> 16:47.860]  gravity wise into the coil and I'm going to hold it to where it, you know what I mean, right? It's
[16:47.860 --> 16:51.620]  where the fucking hash is melting into the coil while I hit it and I'm going to give it a, give
[16:51.620 --> 16:55.540]  it a third try and we're going to see how this goes. So excuse me for one second. You'll get
[16:55.540 --> 16:59.300]  more silence, but I'm going to try this. Hopefully we don't end up with hash down my throat while I'm
[16:59.300 --> 17:17.400]  driving. No smoke and a little more hash in my mouth. So, uh, we will try this again on an episode
[17:17.400 --> 17:22.360]  at home when we're in the house to where we're not driving in the car trying to do this. But so far,
[17:22.360 --> 17:29.880]  uh, the disposable G pin, uh, I find it to be a fail. I think you press it five times to turn it
[17:29.880 --> 17:34.360]  off. Let's see. One, two, three, four, five. It flashed and went off. I'm going to set that in
[17:34.360 --> 17:39.880]  the seat next to me, next to the microphone case. And, uh, we're going to say fail on that for now.
[17:39.880 --> 17:43.320]  You guys got to take a quick drink. Cause I have a bunch of chunks of wax stuck in my teeth.
[17:44.040 --> 17:48.360]  A live resident in my mouth. So, uh, we've been going for a few minutes. Give me just one second.
[17:48.360 --> 17:52.120]  I'm gonna set down the microphone. I'll edit this out, but I need to take a drink. Hold on. I got
[17:52.120 --> 17:55.240]  because of that pen, I've got melted wax in my teeth. Hold on. Here we go.
[18:09.830 --> 18:13.190]  All right. I might edit a few seconds of that out. I apologize. You guys had to take a drink.
[18:13.990 --> 18:19.750]  There's nothing like having hash smeared across your two front teeth. That was weird. All right.
[18:19.750 --> 18:24.310]  So where was I? I was talking about the champs trade show, right? You guys champs trade show
[18:24.310 --> 18:30.310]  was at the Denver convention center. It was free. Um, they make it seem like you need to be some
[18:30.310 --> 18:35.510]  sort of a vendor or have some sort of a license to get in there. But honestly, uh, I don't have,
[18:36.150 --> 18:39.670]  uh, well I do, I have an LLC and shit, but I walked up and said, Hey, I'm here. And they said,
[18:39.670 --> 18:44.630]  what company are you with? And I said, uh, well I was with my buddy, Tim, and he didn't even say
[18:44.630 --> 18:49.270]  anything. I said, I'm with organica. And they looked at Tim and Tim's with organica. And so
[18:49.270 --> 18:52.630]  they said, what's your name? And I said, Ross to Jeff. And she wrote my name on a little tag
[18:52.630 --> 18:57.190]  and handed it to me. No questions asked. It didn't cost me anything. Champs is a free event.
[18:57.190 --> 19:01.270]  If you're in the industry. Uh, if not, all you're going to do is have a good reason to be there and
[19:01.270 --> 19:04.950]  tell them that that's why you're there. If you have like a wholesale license or something like
[19:04.950 --> 19:08.950]  that, you can definitely get in. If not, you've got a friend that has a way to get you into
[19:08.950 --> 19:14.390]  champs. If you want to want to go, um, it's free, which is a good thing because it's not really
[19:14.390 --> 19:18.230]  worth a whole bunch of money to walk through there. If it was like a $5 ticket, I wouldn't
[19:18.230 --> 19:22.630]  complain. Uh, it was a cool event. There's nowhere to sit down. It's illegal to Medicaid in the
[19:22.630 --> 19:26.550]  building. It's illegal to consume cannabis in the building. You can't even hit a vape pen.
[19:26.550 --> 19:29.990]  They did not like that. Of course, like I said, there were a couple of people taking a couple of
[19:29.990 --> 19:34.630]  Ross and dabs, but they would have been escorted out. Had they been caught? Um, it was a great
[19:34.630 --> 19:39.190]  event. It was fun. I had a good time. The best part for me, honestly, was linking up with a
[19:39.190 --> 19:43.430]  bunch of people from the industry. Uh, what up Anthony? What up Johnny B? Sorry, I forgot you
[19:43.430 --> 19:47.750]  guys. I did not mean to skip you. I apologize. We spent some time together hanging out and I almost
[19:47.750 --> 19:51.110]  fucking spaced it. You know why? Because our conversation was just friendly and natural.
[19:51.110 --> 19:55.750]  It wasn't something that had to be, uh, documented. It was just a good conversation, which I love.
[19:55.750 --> 20:03.350]  So shout out to, uh, also, uh, Jonathan. Yeah, Jonathan dude. And, uh, and Dan that's who was
[20:03.430 --> 20:08.390]  with John. Yeah. A whole bunch of people saw me. I was, I saw them. It was fun hanging out. That was
[20:08.390 --> 20:12.230]  my favorite part was meeting up with people and shaking hands and seeing everybody. It was a
[20:12.230 --> 20:15.590]  really, really good time. So it's a great place to go if you're in the industry and you know,
[20:15.590 --> 20:21.590]  a few people, uh, you can buy a lot of great glass at very great discounted prices.
[20:21.590 --> 20:25.910]  I saw some beautiful, beautiful glass, but you guys, honestly, I'm not into buying
[20:26.470 --> 20:31.350]  really artful glass lately. I've been buying what they call production work and functional glass.
[20:31.350 --> 20:36.950]  That's just clear and hits like a champ. I hate it when I spend hundreds to a thousand dollars on
[20:36.950 --> 20:40.710]  a nice rig. Hold on. I got to put the microphone down here. Cause the car just give me one second.
[20:43.030 --> 20:46.310]  All right. I just didn't want that car to see me talking into the mic. I hate it when you spend a
[20:46.310 --> 20:51.190]  lot of money or your friends spend a lot of money on a rig and you can only put like a really certain
[20:51.190 --> 20:54.950]  amount of water in there because one drop more, it splashes in your mouth and one drop less,
[20:54.950 --> 20:59.670]  it doesn't perk. Right. I found that to be really annoying on a custom made piece. So I buy
[20:59.670 --> 21:04.070]  production pieces that are clear and I think they hit like a fucking champ. You guys, I think there's
[21:04.070 --> 21:07.830]  nothing wrong with having a clear rig. You don't even need to spend a lot of money on a rig. You
[21:07.830 --> 21:12.150]  guys, you could have spent 40 bucks on a really nice rig today and been set up. Uh, you could have
[21:12.150 --> 21:16.950]  got a highly educated titanium nail and a carb cap for a really good price. Champs is a great place.
[21:16.950 --> 21:20.870]  If you're looking to come up on a rig or two, or if you've got a wholesale license, it was really
[21:20.870 --> 21:26.310]  the place to buy a whole bunch of shit. All right. So, uh, also shout out to grassroots. Grassroots
[21:26.310 --> 21:32.790]  was there set up in style. Um, yeah. So for a free event, it was really a good time. It was a great
[21:32.790 --> 21:38.550]  day in Denver. It rained a little bit, but that didn't slow anybody down. Uh, most of the vendors
[21:38.550 --> 21:44.310]  that I really appreciated seeing will be at the cannabis cup in Denver or excuse me, I'm burping.
[21:45.030 --> 21:49.110]  They'll be at the cannabis cup in Denver in April. If that happens, there's rumors that that may not
[21:49.110 --> 21:52.150]  happen. I'm not going to start talking shit about it on the show, but there've been rumors that that
[21:52.150 --> 21:56.950]  won't happen. Let's hope that it does. Most of those vendors will be available and present at
[21:56.950 --> 22:01.590]  the cannabis cup in full force. If there's a cannabis cup in your area, I bet those vendors
[22:01.590 --> 22:05.910]  will be there. Make sure you look out for oil slick, get an oil slick pad, keep your table from
[22:05.910 --> 22:11.030]  getting all fucking sticky. Check out hit man glass. Hit man makes really good glass that hits
[22:11.030 --> 22:15.270]  like a truck every fucking time. When you get new glass, what do you need? You need a new nail. Who
[22:15.270 --> 22:20.070]  do you go for for that? You go to highly educated titanium. You get yourself a nail. I like a
[22:20.070 --> 22:25.270]  domeless nail and a carb cap. I think that's the way to go. Then you need some cool ass t-shirts.
[22:25.270 --> 22:29.510]  Who do you get your t-shirts printed through? You go to handmade apparel. There's another car on the
[22:29.510 --> 22:33.190]  highway. Let's just get behind them and cruise for a little while so they don't see me talking into a
[22:33.190 --> 22:38.150]  microphone. Yeah, guys, I am driving on the interstate. We're now approaching Woodman Road
[22:38.150 --> 22:43.430]  in the beautiful city of Colorado Springs, Colorado. Let's see. I've been recording for 22
[22:43.430 --> 22:47.270]  minutes. I should pay attention more to the road than the recording, but I'm the only one out here
[22:47.270 --> 22:58.060]  other than this guy in front of me. I'm going to get passed by a truck. Here we go. All right.
[22:59.660 --> 23:03.340]  So, yeah, I've got a bunch of great shit planned for more episodes. You guys, I'm just going to put
[23:03.340 --> 23:07.820]  this out as a Thursday episode or a bonus Thursday episode. This will not be your Monday primary
[23:07.820 --> 23:12.220]  episode. I just wanted to ramble for a little bit while I was driving, see if I could actually do a
[23:12.220 --> 23:17.340]  car podcast. Never thought of that before. Now that I've got this nice gear, I felt it would be
[23:17.340 --> 23:23.420]  necessary. You guys, I've got an episode coming up Monday. I think Monday we are going to talk
[23:23.420 --> 23:29.660]  about ways, reasons why your cannabis is not top shelf and ways that you can improve your cannabis
[23:29.660 --> 23:34.140]  and make it top shelf. It wouldn't take a whole lot for most of you guys just to upgrade your
[23:34.140 --> 23:38.620]  grow just a little bit. It won't cost you money. It will cost you more time, energy, effort, and
[23:38.620 --> 23:44.940]  attention, which we all should have. I've got an episode about CBD planned. I think I have an
[23:44.940 --> 23:49.740]  episode with Fox planned. I have an episode about blowing glass and the glass industry coming up
[23:49.740 --> 23:55.020]  with our friend Will. I'm going to try to get a whole bunch of grow lessons planned out. I've got
[23:55.020 --> 23:59.260]  some great shit in my mind. You guys are going to love it. I want to thank you guys for listening to
[23:59.260 --> 24:03.900]  this short car episode. I'm going to get off the microphone. I don't have anything else left to say.
[24:04.460 --> 24:08.140]  I appreciate you guys. I love you guys every day like my own adopted children.
[24:08.140 --> 24:12.460]  I will be back Monday with the full episode. Don't judge me by the quality of this episode,
[24:12.460 --> 24:16.860]  you guys. I recorded this in the car while driving after the Champs trade show in Denver.
[24:17.820 --> 24:22.380]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
