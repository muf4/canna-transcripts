[00:11.340 --> 00:14.340]  Oh shit, Rasta Jeff in the house.
[00:14.340 --> 00:20.340]  When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious shit.
[00:20.340 --> 00:22.340]  Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit.
[00:22.340 --> 00:23.340]  Man, what you gonna do now?
[00:23.340 --> 00:25.340]  What we gonna do right here is go back.
[00:25.340 --> 00:26.340]  Before you going back.
[00:26.340 --> 00:27.340]  Way back.
[00:27.340 --> 00:30.340]  As we go a little something like this.
[00:30.340 --> 00:31.340]  Hit it.
[00:32.340 --> 00:34.340]  Yeah, what's up podcast world?
[00:34.340 --> 00:39.340]  It's Thursday and that means it's time for another Throwback Thursday episode of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:39.340 --> 00:42.340]  Before we get to the old episodes, let me make a quick disclaimer.
[00:42.340 --> 00:48.340]  If I mention any advertising, any giveaways, any promotions or any contests, all of that stuff has expired.
[00:48.340 --> 00:53.340]  There are no advertisements, promotions, giveaways or contests that are valid in these old episodes.
[00:53.340 --> 00:56.340]  I want to thank you guys for listening and with no further ado,
[00:56.340 --> 01:00.340]  here's a block of old episodes of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:01.340 --> 01:21.080]  Cannabis community, it's time for episode number 144 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:21.080 --> 01:25.080]  Your source for cannabis news, education and conversation.
[01:25.080 --> 01:29.080]  That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[01:29.080 --> 01:34.080]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[01:34.080 --> 01:36.080]  this my friends is the podcast for you.
[01:36.080 --> 01:38.080]  I'm your host, my friends, call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:38.080 --> 01:40.080]  I want to thank you guys once again for joining me.
[01:40.080 --> 01:46.080]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[01:46.080 --> 01:50.080]  Big shout out to Kat, Koot and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:51.080 --> 01:55.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome to the show, the traveling stoner.
[01:55.080 --> 01:56.080]  Welcome, Lindsay.
[01:56.080 --> 01:57.080]  Hi, how are you?
[01:57.080 --> 01:58.080]  I'm great. How about yourself?
[01:58.080 --> 01:59.080]  I'm doing good.
[01:59.080 --> 02:01.080]  You look all high, you got a beautiful smile. Thanks for joining us.
[02:01.080 --> 02:03.080]  Thank you. Yeah, I'm super stoned today actually.
[02:03.080 --> 02:09.080]  I've eaten close to like 500 milligrams today, so bear with me, I guess today.
[02:09.080 --> 02:10.080]  I heard you took a little nap.
[02:10.080 --> 02:11.080]  Yeah.
[02:11.080 --> 02:14.080]  Thanks for getting out of bed to come hang out with us. We appreciate it.
[02:14.080 --> 02:15.080]  The listeners like having you here.
[02:15.080 --> 02:17.080]  Thank you for having me.
[02:17.080 --> 02:22.080]  Directly in front of me is the man, the myth, the legend of Mr. Bobo Blastrico, also known as Chris.
[02:22.080 --> 02:23.080]  Hello.
[02:23.080 --> 02:24.080]  Thanks for joining us, bro.
[02:24.080 --> 02:25.080]  Thank you for having me here.
[02:25.080 --> 02:27.080]  Dude, how was Portugal?
[02:27.080 --> 02:28.080]  It was amazing.
[02:28.080 --> 02:29.080]  Did you do any Portuguese drugs?
[02:29.080 --> 02:32.080]  I did not. I did not. I actually finally got asked for it.
[02:32.080 --> 02:33.080]  I wish you guys could...
[02:33.080 --> 02:34.080]  Offered hash.
[02:34.080 --> 02:37.080]  I'm turning down the music. I wish you guys could see the look of disappointment in my face.
[02:37.080 --> 02:39.080]  You were in Portugal where everything is legal.
[02:39.080 --> 02:41.080]  I was with my mom and my stepdad.
[02:41.080 --> 02:43.080]  Okay. All right. Party's back on.
[02:43.080 --> 02:47.080]  Actually, you know what? I was with my mom when I got offered hash, and my mom was like,
[02:47.080 --> 02:49.080]  Oh, what did that guy over there?
[02:49.080 --> 02:51.080]  I was like, Oh, the guy with the polo shirt offered me hash.
[02:51.080 --> 02:55.080]  And I was like, Your shit sucks. No, I got it right.
[02:55.080 --> 02:58.080]  You got some BHO, bro. You got some Turpex over here.
[02:58.080 --> 03:00.080]  He's like, Hashish, hashish.
[03:00.080 --> 03:02.080]  And I was like, No, I'm good. Thanks, man.
[03:02.080 --> 03:04.080]  All right. Well, I'm glad you made it back.
[03:04.080 --> 03:05.080]  Yes, yes. I'm happy to be back.
[03:05.080 --> 03:07.080]  I'm glad that you didn't try any Portuguese drugs.
[03:07.080 --> 03:08.080]  Yeah, no.
[03:08.080 --> 03:09.080]  How was Florida?
[03:09.080 --> 03:10.080]  It was hot.
[03:10.080 --> 03:11.080]  Hot in Florida?
[03:11.080 --> 03:12.080]  Yeah.
[03:12.080 --> 03:13.080]  All right.
[03:13.080 --> 03:14.080]  That awesome Florida-ish.
[03:14.080 --> 03:15.080]  Soup feeling. Soup balls.
[03:15.080 --> 03:16.080]  Yeah.
[03:16.080 --> 03:18.080]  I see you brought a hot date back from Florida with you.
[03:18.080 --> 03:21.080]  Yes, yes. My four-legged awesomeness.
[03:21.080 --> 03:22.080]  What's the dog's name again?
[03:22.080 --> 03:23.080]  Layla.
[03:23.080 --> 03:24.080]  Layla. Beautiful dog. Welcome home, Layla.
[03:24.080 --> 03:25.080]  Yes, yes.
[03:25.080 --> 03:26.080]  I'm glad you're back, bro.
[03:26.080 --> 03:27.080]  Thank you. Thank you.
[03:27.080 --> 03:28.080]  Dabs, dabs.
[03:28.080 --> 03:32.080]  To my left, my nine o'clock-ish position, you guys, you know who he is. It's the Bramble King.
[03:32.080 --> 03:33.080]  What's up, everybody?
[03:33.080 --> 03:35.080]  Mike is back on the show. Thanks for joining me, brother.
[03:35.080 --> 03:37.080]  Yeah, man. Always.
[03:37.080 --> 03:41.080]  It's going to be a great show. I think everyone is perfectly high for this episode.
[03:41.080 --> 03:42.080]  Thoroughly baked.
[03:42.080 --> 03:44.080]  Sometimes we're a little too dabbed. Sometimes we're not dabbed enough.
[03:44.080 --> 03:47.080]  Sometimes I've had too much caffeine. I think we're doing all right today.
[03:47.080 --> 03:48.080]  This is going to be a good fucking show.
[03:48.080 --> 03:49.080]  Perfect.
[03:49.080 --> 03:51.080]  Welcome, everybody. We're going to settle in and do a podcast.
[03:51.080 --> 03:56.080]  The main beef of this podcast, the main heart and soul is going to be somebody sent me an email,
[03:56.080 --> 03:59.080]  and they wanted to know, since a lot of our friends here work in dispensaries,
[03:59.080 --> 04:03.080]  and I've been in a dispensary environment for the past several years, we got a question.
[04:03.080 --> 04:09.080]  They want to know about what's the craziest shit we have ever seen in a dispensary or at a smoke event.
[04:09.080 --> 04:12.080]  But before we get to that, I want to do a couple of emails.
[04:12.080 --> 04:16.080]  Let's do Kip's first because his name is Kip, and that's cool as fuck.
[04:16.080 --> 04:19.080]  I've never met anybody in person whose name was Kip, I don't think.
[04:19.080 --> 04:22.080]  That's a cool name. You've got to be cool as shit if your name is Kip.
[04:22.080 --> 04:23.080]  That means you've got cool parents.
[04:23.080 --> 04:25.080]  Kip, shout out to Kip.
[04:25.080 --> 04:27.080]  I found Kip on Facebook. He sent me a message.
[04:27.080 --> 04:31.080]  It says, I have some plants that I need, that I had a friend take care of during a trip.
[04:31.080 --> 04:36.080]  And even though on average he's a decent grower, he put my 10-inch plants with his that were a few feet high
[04:36.080 --> 04:41.080]  and didn't raise them up, and they were severely stretched, almost eight inches between nodes.
[04:41.080 --> 04:46.080]  He said, on average, I'd waste them and start new stock, but I'm currently out of seeds and clones due to the trip,
[04:46.080 --> 04:49.080]  and I don't have any good candidates for clones other than the tops of the plants.
[04:49.080 --> 04:51.080]  There's your answer right there, bro.
[04:51.080 --> 04:55.080]  He goes on to say, if it wasn't the last of the genetics I had, I'd waste them
[04:56.080 --> 05:02.080]  or pull the tops and clone it, but I'm wondering if you had any quick ways to maybe get a plant to put out some shoots
[05:02.080 --> 05:04.080]  so I have something to clip.
[05:04.080 --> 05:08.080]  The clone I'm running 600 watt HPS at the time.
[05:08.080 --> 05:10.080]  Age old newts in dirt.
[05:10.080 --> 05:14.080]  I usually use Nectar of the Gods, but I can't see spending a fortune to raise these plants.
[05:14.080 --> 05:16.080]  Any help would be appreciated.
[05:16.080 --> 05:20.080]  You can put them into bigger pots and top them, and they'll start shooting out more shoots.
[05:20.080 --> 05:23.080]  Give them a high phosphorus diet with a lot of nitrogen and phosphorus.
[05:23.080 --> 05:25.080]  They'll spit out more shoots.
[05:25.080 --> 05:28.080]  There's a product called Bushmaster that'll make them shoot out more shoots.
[05:28.080 --> 05:30.080]  Put them into bigger pots.
[05:30.080 --> 05:32.080]  Feed them a good diet, and they'll shoot out more shoots.
[05:32.080 --> 05:33.080]  Give them plenty of light.
[05:33.080 --> 05:34.080]  Give them plenty of space.
[05:34.080 --> 05:35.080]  Top them.
[05:35.080 --> 05:37.080]  Do some topping and pinching techniques.
[05:37.080 --> 05:41.080]  But your main answer to your question is, what's left there is the tops of those plants.
[05:41.080 --> 05:42.080]  Clone those, bro.
[05:42.080 --> 05:43.080]  Clone those right away.
[05:43.080 --> 05:49.080]  Get those healthy tops cloned in a cloner, labeled, get them rooted, and then take really good care of those new clones.
[05:49.080 --> 05:51.080]  That's the solution for that.
[05:51.080 --> 05:52.080]  I appreciate the message on Facebook.
[05:52.080 --> 06:04.080]  If you have any more questions, please send them to me on Facebook or hit me up at growfromyourheartathotmail.com, and I will read your messages on the show.
[06:04.080 --> 06:06.080]  All right, I'm searching for an email I've got.
[06:06.080 --> 06:10.080]  We're going to do one more email, and then we're going to talk about the crazy shit that these folks have seen in dispensaries.
[06:10.080 --> 06:12.080]  Everyone's looking at me like, I want to talk about dispensary shit.
[06:12.080 --> 06:14.080]  You guys start thinking about it now.
[06:14.080 --> 06:16.080]  Get your stories brewing in your heads.
[06:16.080 --> 06:21.080]  Some interesting shit you saw at Metamar, some crazy shit that's happened to you over at Green and Healthy Wellness.
[06:21.080 --> 06:26.080]  I'm sure you've been to dispensaries and seen some crazy shit also, Bobo, so get those stories cooking in your head.
[06:26.080 --> 06:28.080]  Can we talk about the smoke shop too?
[06:28.080 --> 06:29.080]  Oh, yes.
[06:29.080 --> 06:30.080]  That's all.
[06:30.080 --> 06:31.080]  That's all.
[06:31.080 --> 06:33.080]  Canna Canyon, all that stuff, Secret Sash, Cannabis Cup.
[06:33.080 --> 06:35.080]  That's all fair game in this.
[06:35.080 --> 06:37.080]  All right, this email, though.
[06:37.080 --> 06:40.080]  This one is, I think I already said his name.
[06:40.080 --> 06:41.080]  I don't know if I was supposed to say his name.
[06:41.080 --> 06:43.080]  I said his name out loud once already.
[06:43.080 --> 06:44.080]  I may have edited that out.
[06:44.080 --> 06:46.080]  He says, Wagwan Rasta Jeff, first off, I love the podcast.
[06:46.080 --> 06:53.080]  I burn through all the episodes on Stitcher in about a week, and I have to wait painfully from week to week for each new episode.
[06:53.080 --> 06:55.080]  I think there are 10 episodes available on Stitcher.
[06:55.080 --> 06:56.080]  So you burn through.
[06:56.080 --> 07:03.080]  Yeah, if you go to my website, iRegeneticsColorado.com, there are 100 episodes available on there for you.
[07:03.080 --> 07:05.080]  The last 100 episodes are up there.
[07:05.080 --> 07:12.080]  If you want more episodes other than that, send me an email, and I will consider sending you files of the shit that's not up there.
[07:12.080 --> 07:14.080]  I do need to post some of the older stuff.
[07:14.080 --> 07:16.080]  There's some stuff that was really useful that is phased out.
[07:16.080 --> 07:18.080]  Like a couple of the episodes were really helpful.
[07:18.080 --> 07:21.080]  Some of those early episodes had a lot of heavy grow information.
[07:21.080 --> 07:26.080]  I may go throw some of those out, like midweek episodes, just as bonus repeats again.
[07:26.080 --> 07:30.080]  All right, but anyway, he says, I found that what it, let's see.
[07:30.080 --> 07:36.080]  Being from an illegal state of Pennsylvania, I cannot take your advice in the literal sense due to legalities.
[07:36.080 --> 07:41.080]  However, I have found that what is good for the cannabis plant is also good for some vegetable plants.
[07:41.080 --> 07:48.080]  Adding organic nutrients such as compost teas and trimming techniques like lollipopping have done wonders for my tomatoes and hot peppers.
[07:48.080 --> 07:50.080]  Keep up the good work.
[07:50.080 --> 07:52.080]  I'm glad that's applicable to your outdoor veggie garden.
[07:52.080 --> 07:53.080]  That's rad.
[07:53.080 --> 07:58.080]  He goes on to say, I also welcome the great advice from White Mike on the legal side of things.
[07:58.080 --> 08:05.080]  Recently in Pennsylvania, the Senate and House unanimously passed a bill allowing for restricted hemp production for university research.
[08:05.080 --> 08:08.080]  It's currently awaiting the final signature from Governor Tom Wolf.
[08:08.080 --> 08:10.080]  I know a dude named Tom Wolf.
[08:10.080 --> 08:15.080]  He also says, I know we are miles behind Colorado, but I guess we need to start somewhere.
[08:15.080 --> 08:19.080]  He continues, with my wife and I will have the pleasure of visiting your fine state next week.
[08:19.080 --> 08:22.080]  That'll probably be by the time this podcast airs.
[08:22.080 --> 08:24.080]  So I'm going to email him before that.
[08:24.080 --> 08:28.080]  But he says, we are overjoyed and have been counting down for weeks.
[08:28.080 --> 08:33.080]  We will of course be flying into Denver, into the Denver area and beginning our adventure from there.
[08:33.080 --> 08:38.080]  My first question is, do you have any recommendations for recreational dispensaries in the Denver region?
[08:38.080 --> 08:43.080]  We want to make sure we establish a reputable place with products that are grown from the heart.
[08:43.080 --> 08:50.080]  Then a second question is, do you think you could do an episode on how to troubleshoot and solve different signs of nutrient burn and or nutrient deficiencies?
[08:50.080 --> 08:57.080]  If you have a potassium deficiency, you would see these signs as opposed to nitrogen deficiency, et cetera.
[08:57.080 --> 08:59.080]  I think that would make a great informative episode.
[08:59.080 --> 09:01.080]  Bro, that episode is going to happen.
[09:01.080 --> 09:04.080]  Watch, screenshot of your email so that I'll remember that.
[09:04.080 --> 09:05.080]  I will do that episode.
[09:05.080 --> 09:06.080]  That's a really good idea.
[09:06.080 --> 09:09.080]  Then he says, anyway, before I keep rambling, don't worry, bro.
[09:09.080 --> 09:10.080]  We like it when you ramble.
[09:10.080 --> 09:16.080]  I just want to say you are a, you are very good at your career and give great advice.
[09:16.080 --> 09:20.080]  If you are, if you ever have any photography questions, don't hesitate to hit me up.
[09:20.080 --> 09:23.080]  It would be awesome to someday meet you and do some dabs.
[09:23.080 --> 09:26.080]  But until then, give my mom a hug for you.
[09:26.080 --> 09:27.080]  Best of luck.
[09:27.080 --> 09:31.080]  And then he says, you can just call me Fats if you decide to read this on the air.
[09:31.080 --> 09:32.080]  Well, thanks Fats.
[09:32.080 --> 09:33.080]  I will edit your name out there.
[09:33.080 --> 09:34.080]  Thanks bro.
[09:34.080 --> 09:35.080]  We appreciate that.
[09:35.080 --> 09:36.080]  He had two questions for you guys.
[09:36.080 --> 09:43.080]  He asked about a dispensary, a recreational dispensary recommendation in the Denver area.
[09:43.080 --> 09:48.080]  I unfortunately have no clue where to tell you to go because I don't buy recreational cannabis.
[09:48.080 --> 09:55.080]  I grow and then I'm a master grower at a shop where I just go there and pick up flowers on that employee discount and smoke those.
[09:55.080 --> 10:00.080]  Does anybody in the room have a recommendation for a reputable dispensary in the Denver area?
[10:00.080 --> 10:02.080]  Everybody just go sign like.
[10:02.080 --> 10:03.080]  Google reviews.
[10:03.080 --> 10:06.080]  Honestly, that's your best bet is to hop on your phone.
[10:06.080 --> 10:07.080]  Weedmaps.
[10:07.080 --> 10:08.080]  Weedmaps.
[10:08.080 --> 10:12.080]  The clinic has always been one of my favorite places to send people.
[10:12.080 --> 10:13.080]  The clinic has a rec side.
[10:13.080 --> 10:15.080]  The clinic is a great place in my opinion.
[10:15.080 --> 10:17.080]  Their flowers are always quality.
[10:17.080 --> 10:23.080]  I can't guarantee anything about the, oh look, we got a text message from somebody in the other room listening and they say Natty Rems.
[10:23.080 --> 10:25.080]  I was just going to say that.
[10:25.080 --> 10:27.080]  So go to Natty Rems.
[10:27.080 --> 10:28.080]  That's funny.
[10:28.080 --> 10:31.080]  I was just going to say the only thing I can really recommend is places I've been.
[10:31.080 --> 10:35.080]  I've been into Natty Rems and it's actually a very nice.
[10:35.080 --> 10:37.080]  They take green solutions.
[10:37.080 --> 10:39.080]  I was going to say green solutions as well.
[10:39.080 --> 10:45.080]  It's been over a year since I've been into a shop in Denver and I honestly can't remember if the last two were rec or med.
[10:45.080 --> 10:47.080]  I would say fly into Denver.
[10:47.080 --> 10:48.080]  Get to your hotel.
[10:48.080 --> 10:49.080]  Get on your phone.
[10:49.080 --> 10:51.080]  Download the Weedmaps app.
[10:51.080 --> 10:55.080]  And then just look what's near your hotel and then read reviews for a few of those places.
[10:55.080 --> 10:56.080]  And don't hit just one place, bro.
[10:56.080 --> 10:58.080]  Go to a couple places.
[10:58.080 --> 10:59.080]  Check them out.
[10:59.080 --> 11:00.080]  Get the experience.
[11:00.080 --> 11:03.080]  Every place is going to have a different vibe of some sort.
[11:03.080 --> 11:04.080]  There's going to be different music.
[11:04.080 --> 11:07.080]  Like at the spot, the music is loud.
[11:07.080 --> 11:10.080]  It's reggae in your face as soon as you get there.
[11:10.080 --> 11:13.080]  It's a real salesy environment.
[11:13.080 --> 11:14.080]  They want you to buy, buy, buy.
[11:14.080 --> 11:20.080]  Things are set up to where it's like impulse buys right where you need them and it's got that kind of flow to it.
[11:20.080 --> 11:26.080]  Green and Healthy, on the other hand, I know the owner, he wanted to set it up more with the art gallery sort of a feel.
[11:26.080 --> 11:27.080]  And it does have that sort of a feel.
[11:27.080 --> 11:28.080]  It's more spread out.
[11:28.080 --> 11:29.080]  It's more spacious.
[11:29.080 --> 11:30.080]  There's artwork everywhere.
[11:30.080 --> 11:36.080]  And so every dispensary and the quality of product from the two shops is amazingly fucking different.
[11:36.080 --> 11:37.080]  And just the whole vibe.
[11:37.080 --> 11:39.080]  The selections are different too.
[11:39.080 --> 11:43.080]  I mean, every shop is going to have its own vibe, its own selection, its own way of doing things.
[11:43.080 --> 11:49.080]  And especially if you're from Pennsylvania, it's worth hitting several just to check out the different ones.
[11:49.080 --> 11:52.080]  You're also going to want to make time to hit Illusion's Glass Gallery downtown.
[11:52.080 --> 11:53.080]  Absolutely.
[11:53.080 --> 11:54.080]  Shout out to White Mike.
[11:54.080 --> 11:56.080]  Yeah, you're definitely.
[11:57.080 --> 11:59.080]  It's somewhere you're going to want to stop.
[11:59.080 --> 12:02.080]  Just make sure it's part of your trip.
[12:02.080 --> 12:04.080]  And be careful smoking in your hotel.
[12:04.080 --> 12:07.080]  You may think that because you're in Colorado now we can smoke out the hotel.
[12:07.080 --> 12:08.080]  Negative.
[12:08.080 --> 12:09.080]  Negative.
[12:09.080 --> 12:11.080]  Make sure that you've got a marijuana-friendly room.
[12:11.080 --> 12:19.080]  And if you're worried about calling and asking the hotel, just call it from your phone and pretend like you're lost or coming next week and want to know what their policy is.
[12:19.080 --> 12:21.080]  They'll be happy to explain it to you.
[12:22.080 --> 12:37.080]  If you're going to smoke in your room or do something like that, I would highly recommend looking into things like the Smoke Buddy and the scented candles from smoke shops, the ones that are actually like.
[12:37.080 --> 12:38.080]  Hella ozone.
[12:38.080 --> 12:40.080]  Yeah, for sure.
[12:40.080 --> 12:41.080]  Just go out on the balcony if you can.
[12:41.080 --> 12:42.080]  Yeah.
[12:42.080 --> 12:43.080]  But if you, you know.
[12:43.080 --> 12:49.080]  If you set off the smoke alarm, they will charge you the $250 or $500 cleaning fee depending on how bougie the hotel is.
[12:49.080 --> 12:50.080]  Yeah.
[12:50.080 --> 12:51.080]  They'll charge you for that shit.
[12:51.080 --> 12:53.080]  But yeah, the Smoke Buddy, a little vape pen.
[12:53.080 --> 12:55.080]  Aren't you repping a new vape pen company?
[12:55.080 --> 12:56.080]  Yeah.
[12:56.080 --> 12:57.080]  What's the name of that pen?
[12:57.080 --> 12:59.080]  You can shout them out on the show since you're here.
[12:59.080 --> 13:00.080]  Cool.
[13:00.080 --> 13:03.080]  Kinetic Products is what they are on Instagram.
[13:03.080 --> 13:07.080]  Their website to order stuff will be up and running on the 25th of this month.
[13:08.080 --> 13:18.080]  So, and I don't actually have the exact website for that yet, but you can check them out on Instagram at Kinetic Products and they have a wax pen that has a quartz coil in it.
[13:18.080 --> 13:19.080]  Nice.
[13:19.080 --> 13:20.080]  They have a lot of cool products.
[13:20.080 --> 13:22.080]  She's been bragging about it for a little while.
[13:22.080 --> 13:27.080]  Spell Kinetic for us because I think when you say Kinetic, I see with a K, but it's the Colorado C.
[13:27.080 --> 13:28.080]  Right.
[13:28.080 --> 13:29.080]  It's C-A-N-N.
[13:29.080 --> 13:31.080]  Oh, like canna.
[13:31.080 --> 13:32.080]  Yeah.
[13:32.080 --> 13:33.080]  Okay.
[13:33.080 --> 13:34.080]  See, they went with the Colorado.
[13:34.080 --> 13:35.080]  I just saw that coming.
[13:36.080 --> 13:37.080]  They ultra did it.
[13:37.080 --> 13:42.080]  It's C-A-N-N-E-T-I-C dot products.
[13:42.080 --> 13:44.080]  Help out our listeners a little bit.
[13:44.080 --> 13:45.080]  For sure.
[13:45.080 --> 13:46.080]  All right.
[13:46.080 --> 13:47.080]  So, let's get back on track.
[13:47.080 --> 13:49.080]  Kip, your second question.
[13:49.080 --> 13:51.080]  First question was dispensary recommendations.
[13:51.080 --> 13:53.080]  Second question, yes, I'm going to do that.
[13:53.080 --> 13:56.080]  Make an episode on troubleshooting and solving problems.
[13:56.080 --> 13:57.080]  That's a really good idea.
[13:57.080 --> 13:58.080]  I've actually got it written down.
[13:58.080 --> 14:04.080]  That's going to be a really in-depth, one of those long episodes I've got to write out and really plan well because there's a lot of stuff to think about.
[14:05.080 --> 14:06.080]  I've got to find a starting point.
[14:06.080 --> 14:10.080]  I think the starting point is printing out that chart that shows you all the leaves with the fuck those problems.
[14:10.080 --> 14:14.080]  There's a couple of useful web pages you're going to want to include in the show notes for that.
[14:14.080 --> 14:15.080]  Yes, I did just smack the microphone.
[14:15.080 --> 14:16.080]  Thank you.
[14:16.080 --> 14:18.080]  Smack the shit out of that mic.
[14:18.080 --> 14:19.080]  Like a bad kid.
[14:19.080 --> 14:20.080]  Beat the shit out of it.
[14:20.080 --> 14:21.080]  All right.
[14:21.080 --> 14:23.080]  So, what am I supposed to call you?
[14:23.080 --> 14:24.080]  Fats.
[14:24.080 --> 14:26.080]  Fats, dude, thanks for sending us an email.
[14:26.080 --> 14:28.080]  When you're in Denver, contact me, bro.
[14:28.080 --> 14:29.080]  Let me know.
[14:29.080 --> 14:30.080]  Message me somehow.
[14:30.080 --> 14:32.080]  Be like, I am about to land in Denver.
[14:32.080 --> 14:37.080]  I'm a busy man, honestly, and Denver is 125 miles from my house.
[14:37.080 --> 14:42.080]  It's 60 miles from my work, but you never know because I go to Denver and do some shit.
[14:42.080 --> 14:44.080]  Doug Benson might be in town.
[14:44.080 --> 14:49.080]  Yeah, if Doug Benson, if Secret Sesh, if it's the way, it could be you might be here during Secret Sesh.
[14:49.080 --> 14:50.080]  Me?
[14:50.080 --> 14:52.080]  No, no, the dude that sent the message.
[14:52.080 --> 14:55.080]  When you looked at me, I was like, what, I'm going.
[14:55.080 --> 14:56.080]  Shout out to Secret Sesh.
[14:56.080 --> 14:57.080]  For sure.
[14:57.080 --> 14:58.080]  It's a secret.
[14:58.080 --> 14:59.080]  Don't talk about it.
[14:59.080 --> 15:01.080]  But maybe you may be here during Secret Sesh.
[15:01.080 --> 15:02.080]  Either way, bro, send me a message.
[15:02.080 --> 15:03.080]  Let me know that you're coming.
[15:03.080 --> 15:07.080]  Email me just like you did and let me know a little more accurate your details.
[15:07.080 --> 15:12.080]  This episode will probably come out by the time your trip already happened, but I'm going to message you and make sure that we get in touch with each other.
[15:12.080 --> 15:13.080]  I hope you hear this.
[15:13.080 --> 15:16.080]  I hope you hear us talking about you, your trip that already happened.
[15:16.080 --> 15:18.080]  To us, it's in the future.
[15:18.080 --> 15:19.080]  To you, it's in the past.
[15:21.080 --> 15:23.080]  Everyone in the roof, their heads just blew up.
[15:23.080 --> 15:25.080]  All right, so I teased this part at the start of the show.
[15:25.080 --> 15:33.080]  We want to talk about the craziest shit we've ever seen in a dispensary or at a smoke event or at a cannabis cup or at the Dab Lounge.
[15:33.080 --> 15:34.080]  Some crazy shit.
[15:34.080 --> 15:37.080]  Lindsey's taking a drink, so I'm going to let Mike go first.
[15:37.080 --> 15:40.080]  Mike and I ran, let's give you a little background story.
[15:40.080 --> 15:47.080]  Mike and I ran the first and only dispensary in city limits in Pueblo, Colorado, and this dispensary was located right at the middle of the city.
[15:47.080 --> 15:51.080]  The east side of our town is hood as fuck.
[15:53.080 --> 15:54.080]  To put it mildly.
[15:54.080 --> 15:55.080]  There's a lot of face tattoos.
[15:56.080 --> 15:57.080]  There's a lot of pocket knives.
[15:58.080 --> 15:59.080]  There's a lot of used guys.
[16:01.080 --> 16:08.080]  It's not the prettiest place to go, so all those people came and then everybody came.
[16:08.080 --> 16:09.080]  All parts of Colorado.
[16:09.080 --> 16:14.080]  This was back in the purely medical days, so it was just anybody who had or wanted a medical marijuana card.
[16:14.080 --> 16:22.080]  We had probably 10 seats inside the place, and there would be people in every chair and then standing outside waiting to come in still.
[16:22.080 --> 16:29.080]  There was a receptionist and myself as a bud tender, and then I hired Mike as a backup bud tender because I couldn't get through everybody.
[16:29.080 --> 16:32.080]  Then my second week, we hired the security guard finally.
[16:33.080 --> 16:37.080]  We were really inventing shit as we went along just making it up.
[16:37.080 --> 16:38.080]  The industry was being invented.
[16:38.080 --> 16:39.080]  There was no ID.
[16:39.080 --> 16:40.080]  Everybody was.
[16:40.080 --> 16:41.080]  There was no badge.
[16:41.080 --> 16:42.080]  There was no time clock.
[16:42.080 --> 16:43.080]  We would show up and just write down the time.
[16:43.080 --> 16:48.080]  There was barely other dispensaries that you could go check out and steal stuff and ideas from.
[16:49.080 --> 16:56.080]  Now, if you're thinking about opening a dispensary, you can just go to 100 of them and pick the 10 things you like about your favorites.
[16:56.080 --> 16:58.080]  Back then, there wasn't even that.
[16:58.080 --> 17:00.080]  The boss would pay me to drive to Denver.
[17:00.080 --> 17:02.080]  If I was going to a concert, he'd be like, here's some money.
[17:02.080 --> 17:03.080]  Stop at a couple of dispensaries.
[17:03.080 --> 17:06.080]  Pick up some advertisements and some product and see what they got.
[17:06.080 --> 17:12.080]  He'd just throw me money to go do recon work and come back and adjust our shit to be a little bit better every time we went.
[17:12.080 --> 17:14.080]  Crazy old dude.
[17:15.080 --> 17:20.080]  Mike and I ran the first place, and I had some fucking crazy experiences in that place.
[17:20.080 --> 17:27.080]  I wrote down, just to give you a tease of my list, threats, plants, gun chat, trades, and gifts.
[17:27.080 --> 17:29.080]  The gifts.
[17:29.080 --> 17:31.080]  Do you remember the lady that gave us the piece of alleged real estate?
[17:31.080 --> 17:33.080]  That's exactly what I meant by gifts.
[17:35.080 --> 17:41.080]  This older lady kind of looked like maybe a 55, 65-year-old better biker chick all her life.
[17:41.080 --> 17:43.080]  She was probably 30, though, to tell you the truth.
[17:44.080 --> 17:46.080]  Sometimes the wind's mean, I guess.
[17:46.080 --> 17:47.080]  I don't know.
[17:47.080 --> 17:48.080]  Life beat her ass.
[17:50.080 --> 17:52.080]  It's a normal transaction.
[17:52.080 --> 17:56.080]  Nothing surprising or interesting about it until right at the end.
[17:56.080 --> 17:57.080]  She's like, you two are sweet.
[17:57.080 --> 17:58.080]  Here, check this out.
[17:58.080 --> 18:02.080]  She reaches into her purse and pulls out this little plastic bag with this black.
[18:02.080 --> 18:05.080]  It looked like old bubble gum and pocket lint.
[18:05.080 --> 18:11.080]  It was black and stringy, I guess is how I would describe it.
[18:11.080 --> 18:12.080]  She's like, here's some opium for you.
[18:12.080 --> 18:13.080]  I hope you enjoy it.
[18:13.080 --> 18:14.080]  It just kind of walked off.
[18:14.080 --> 18:16.080]  You guys know what fake skin looks like from Halloween?
[18:16.080 --> 18:18.080]  That thin layer of fake skin when it dries on your skin?
[18:18.080 --> 18:21.080]  It kind of looked like that folded up in a cellophane.
[18:24.080 --> 18:26.080]  That place was bizarre.
[18:26.080 --> 18:30.080]  My favorite people there were the kids coming there to sell weed.
[18:30.080 --> 18:38.080]  They'd just wander in with a terrified look on their face with a little messenger bag that they were kind of hugging to their side.
[18:39.080 --> 18:41.080]  They're a manager around.
[18:41.080 --> 18:51.080]  Just terrified because this was in the beginning when you could have as much marijuana as you had medical cards for, but it was still 400 an ounce, end of story.
[18:53.080 --> 18:57.080]  They're hauling around a lot more money than they're comfortable with on their hip.
[18:57.080 --> 19:00.080]  As far as most people are concerned, that's a major crime.
[19:00.080 --> 19:04.080]  They just wandered into a store to try and sell it.
[19:04.080 --> 19:06.080]  It's a weird experience, I'm sure.
[19:06.080 --> 19:09.080]  We'd get three or four of those guys a day sometimes.
[19:09.080 --> 19:11.080]  I made a lot of friends from those folks.
[19:11.080 --> 19:13.080]  A lot of future talented.
[19:13.080 --> 19:18.080]  I would offer those guys 800 a quarter pound or 3,200 a pound, take it or leave it.
[19:18.080 --> 19:21.080]  You could get 900 out of me if it was really, really good.
[19:21.080 --> 19:24.080]  A lot of those people would just look at me like, ugh.
[19:24.080 --> 19:27.080]  They wanted so much more for that back then.
[19:27.080 --> 19:31.080]  Now wholesale commercial herb is about $2,000 a pound.
[19:32.080 --> 19:36.080]  You could find it if you're looking for some outdoor commercial rec weed.
[19:36.080 --> 19:39.080]  Do I want to drop any dispensary names?
[19:39.080 --> 19:44.080]  Geez, the stuff that you get over there at that one spot, it's like 100 bucks an ounce.
[19:44.080 --> 19:49.080]  It's probably like $1,500 a pound, $1,400 a pound to get that shit.
[19:49.080 --> 19:51.080]  Yucky.
[19:51.080 --> 19:53.080]  Weeds have gotten way cheaper.
[19:53.080 --> 19:57.080]  All right, Mike, what's one of your fucking craziest memories you have from Metamar?
[19:58.080 --> 20:01.080]  There's so many bizarre ones.
[20:01.080 --> 20:11.080]  The you two falling down the stairs is the edibles one of the manager's owners would make.
[20:11.080 --> 20:12.080]  They were all homemade.
[20:12.080 --> 20:17.080]  They were all delicious, and they were all insanely potent.
[20:17.080 --> 20:23.080]  She was sweet, and she would kind of insist that you eat one of everything when she'd bring in a new batch.
[20:23.080 --> 20:29.080]  By midday or lunch, you'd be too high to form words sometimes.
[20:29.080 --> 20:36.080]  Watching a co-worker tumble down a switchback stair and then land and sprawled out face first in front of a lobby full of customers.
[20:36.080 --> 20:39.080]  Then they just pop up, and they're like, who's next?
[20:41.080 --> 20:43.080]  Quickest way down the stairs.
[20:45.080 --> 20:48.080]  Hauling all the plants out of there.
[20:48.080 --> 20:49.080]  Do you remember that?
[20:49.080 --> 20:51.080]  Yeah, we loaded up an RV.
[20:51.080 --> 20:54.080]  Was it the RV time or the time we did the U-Haul truck?
[20:54.080 --> 20:59.080]  When we got shut down, it was just, you have to stop.
[20:59.080 --> 21:04.080]  We were like, okay, we'll stop then, but we've got all this shit in the store.
[21:04.080 --> 21:05.080]  What do we do with it?
[21:05.080 --> 21:11.080]  Basically, all of the plants that were in the grow were just, if you want them, hauler.
[21:11.080 --> 21:21.080]  For half a day, from noon to midnight, randomly, people would pull up out back, walk around, knock on the door, come inside.
[21:21.080 --> 21:29.080]  We'd pick out the half dozen or dozen or whatever plants they had paperwork for and wanted, load them into whatever vehicle they had, and they'd bail.
[21:29.080 --> 21:31.080]  My backyard was packed.
[21:31.080 --> 21:35.080]  It was one of the most stranger experiences of my life.
[21:36.080 --> 21:43.080]  It was a lot of fun to be ... At one point, there was a U-Haul, and the dude was a caregiver for 11 people.
[21:43.080 --> 21:48.080]  We sat there and went through his paperwork for 20 minutes, double checking everything, and then loaded.
[21:48.080 --> 21:49.080]  Fuck, dude, I don't even know.
[21:49.080 --> 21:54.080]  By the time we got that back of that U-Haul loaded, I was sweating so bad.
[21:54.080 --> 21:56.080]  We moved a lot of plants around at that place.
[21:56.080 --> 21:57.080]  Recently, I had a dude-
[21:57.080 --> 22:00.080]  Sketchy moved plants around.
[22:00.080 --> 22:02.080]  Recently, I had a dude show up.
[22:02.080 --> 22:03.080]  He's just in bed.
[22:03.080 --> 22:08.080]  The dude's maybe 350 pounds, maybe 45 years old, but life's been rough.
[22:08.080 --> 22:09.080]  Is this at the new dig?
[22:09.080 --> 22:12.080]  Yeah, this is the new place.
[22:12.080 --> 22:16.080]  He comes walking up to the door, and already, security guard's like, uh-uh.
[22:16.080 --> 22:21.080]  Halfway to that door, we noticed that there's a good wobble to his walk, too.
[22:21.080 --> 22:22.080]  He gets to the front door.
[22:22.080 --> 22:24.080]  He's like, there's the weed store.
[22:24.080 --> 22:26.080]  The security guard's like, no, sir, you can't come in.
[22:26.080 --> 22:28.080]  He's like, why not?
[22:28.080 --> 22:30.080]  The security guard's like, well, A, you're barefoot.
[22:30.080 --> 22:31.080]  B, you're not wearing a shirt.
[22:31.080 --> 22:32.080]  You're topless.
[22:32.080 --> 22:34.080]  And C, you're drunk.
[22:34.080 --> 22:35.080]  Sir, you have to leave.
[22:35.080 --> 22:37.080]  He's like, no, this is the weed store.
[22:37.080 --> 22:40.080]  He goes to push past my armed security guard.
[22:40.080 --> 22:43.080]  The security guard blocks his way, and is like, sir, you really can't come in.
[22:43.080 --> 22:44.080]  You're barefoot.
[22:44.080 --> 22:45.080]  You're not wearing a shirt.
[22:45.080 --> 22:47.080]  He goes, Jesus, I was barefoot.
[22:47.080 --> 22:52.080]  It's just like, sure.
[22:52.080 --> 22:57.080]  But that doesn't mean we're going to let you into our dispensary.
[22:57.080 --> 23:01.080]  Yeah, that's just random stuff that's popping in my mind right now.
[23:01.080 --> 23:02.080]  I've taken some dabs.
[23:02.080 --> 23:03.080]  I know they're strange as shit.
[23:03.080 --> 23:07.080]  I just keep seeing you fall down those stairs.
[23:07.080 --> 23:12.080]  One time I was sitting at Metamar, and the reason I mentioned the thugs that used to come in,
[23:12.080 --> 23:18.080]  there was a bunch of normal people, and then a group of four or five youngster, gangster kind of kids,
[23:18.080 --> 23:21.080]  and they were all talking about their gun collections.
[23:21.080 --> 23:26.080]  And I could see the white folk just cringing, just like, we're all going to fucking die in here.
[23:26.080 --> 23:27.080]  I could see it on all their faces.
[23:27.080 --> 23:30.080]  That was one of the funniest fucking things I remember.
[23:30.080 --> 23:35.080]  Bro, you don't work in a dispensary, but I'm sure you've seen some whack ass shit somewhere,
[23:35.080 --> 23:37.080]  at a smoke club or a dispensary.
[23:37.080 --> 23:40.080]  Yeah, people just see the craziest shit inside dispensaries.
[23:40.080 --> 23:44.080]  People think just because it's legal, they can just say whatever the hell they want.
[23:44.080 --> 23:47.080]  This isn't a law-free zone.
[23:47.080 --> 23:49.080]  It's just we have legal weed stores.
[23:49.080 --> 23:54.080]  Yeah, like when you go in with your friends, and then your friend passes you all the money,
[23:54.080 --> 23:56.080]  and you're like, yeah, I got you, don't worry about it.
[23:56.080 --> 23:58.080]  You can't do that.
[23:58.080 --> 24:01.080]  Lindsay's shaking her head like, no, you have to leave now.
[24:01.080 --> 24:06.080]  I had some guy come in the dispensary the other day, and he was like buying an ounce of flour,
[24:06.080 --> 24:12.080]  and he said something about it was for somebody else, and I was like, no, this is for you.
[24:12.080 --> 24:15.080]  You know, like you can't say that in here.
[24:15.080 --> 24:18.080]  Like this is your one warning, you know.
[24:18.080 --> 24:20.080]  And he was like, well, it's not a big deal.
[24:20.080 --> 24:23.080]  I'm gifting him this, bud, so I'm allowed to do that.
[24:23.080 --> 24:25.080]  And I was like, no.
[24:25.080 --> 24:26.080]  No.
[24:26.080 --> 24:29.080]  You're not allowed to take your medical card.
[24:29.080 --> 24:30.080]  Not on anybody's birthday.
[24:30.080 --> 24:32.080]  Go and buy.
[24:32.080 --> 24:34.080]  You can't just give people.
[24:34.080 --> 24:38.080]  There's different rules for rec and medical, and when you're in a medical shop,
[24:38.080 --> 24:41.080]  you have to play by the height of the medical rules.
[24:41.080 --> 24:47.080]  Legally, it's essentially you're at a pharmacy, and the pharmacist is like, here's your pills.
[24:47.080 --> 24:50.080]  And you're like, cool, I'm going to give them to my cousin, Billy.
[24:50.080 --> 24:51.080]  Right.
[24:51.080 --> 24:54.080]  And you do that two or three times, and the pharmacist is going to go, fuck you and your pills.
[24:54.080 --> 24:56.080]  Like you ain't getting these, and I'm calling the cops.
[24:56.080 --> 24:59.080]  And you actually sign a member agreement at Greener Healthy Wellness that says in bold letters,
[24:59.080 --> 25:02.080]  I will not redistribute this medicine to anybody else.
[25:02.080 --> 25:07.080]  And so that's what our main concern there is, that you're not going to – nobody needs to get that medicine from you.
[25:07.080 --> 25:13.080]  If they need that medicine, they have the means to get that product legally themselves.
[25:13.080 --> 25:17.080]  We don't need to be – you don't need to middleman for them.
[25:17.080 --> 25:18.080]  We don't need to know about that.
[25:18.080 --> 25:25.080]  Once you take that cannabis home and take it out of the black package that we've sold it to you in, and some time passes,
[25:25.080 --> 25:27.080]  we don't know what happens after that, and we can't care.
[25:27.080 --> 25:31.080]  But don't tell us about it and take it out of our fucking packaging, no matter what you do with it.
[25:31.080 --> 25:33.080]  Now it's your cannabis.
[25:33.080 --> 25:34.080]  Right.
[25:34.080 --> 25:35.080]  Then whatever can happen.
[25:35.080 --> 25:36.080]  For sure.
[25:36.080 --> 25:40.080]  You can gift your cannabis to people, but not the stuff you got at Greener Healthy.
[25:40.080 --> 25:41.080]  Right.
[25:41.080 --> 25:42.080]  All right.
[25:42.080 --> 25:43.080]  Go for it.
[25:43.080 --> 25:44.080]  You got something to say?
[25:44.080 --> 25:45.080]  I see it in your face.
[25:45.080 --> 25:46.080]  No.
[25:46.080 --> 25:48.080]  I got some poignant message to relay to the world.
[25:48.080 --> 25:52.080]  You can't think of anything from hanging around the smoke shop with me?
[25:52.080 --> 25:58.080]  Well, hanging around the smoke shop, people just thought it was a dispensary, which is still the oddest thing too.
[25:58.080 --> 26:02.080]  You know what's actually really odd that really doesn't have anything to do with weed?
[26:02.080 --> 26:05.080]  I was working in the smoke shop one day.
[26:05.080 --> 26:11.080]  It was a Saturday, and me and my manager were both on the floor, and I had some guy.
[26:11.080 --> 26:17.080]  I was showing him some hand pipe, and I guess I should explain that I don't have hair on the sides of my head.
[26:17.080 --> 26:20.080]  I have the sides of my head shaved.
[26:20.080 --> 26:25.080]  I had my head down, and I was pulling out a pipe to show him.
[26:25.080 --> 26:31.080]  He reaches across the counter, and he takes his hand, and he runs it across the side of my head.
[26:31.080 --> 26:32.080]  Creepy.
[26:32.080 --> 26:33.080]  Yeah.
[26:33.080 --> 26:34.080]  Just caresses the side.
[26:34.080 --> 26:35.080]  That's creepy as a half, dude.
[26:35.080 --> 26:39.080]  I just was like, please don't touch me.
[26:39.080 --> 26:45.080]  I didn't think that I had to make that an out loud rule, but please don't touch me.
[26:45.080 --> 26:46.080]  That's weird.
[26:46.080 --> 26:47.080]  Right?
[26:47.080 --> 26:49.080]  We used to have this guy.
[26:49.080 --> 26:50.080]  It's similar lines.
[26:50.080 --> 26:54.080]  This guy used to come in, and he was kind of a nightmarish customer.
[26:54.080 --> 26:58.080]  He did not typically have a pleasant smell to him.
[26:58.080 --> 27:03.080]  He was typically dressed and took too much acid, went to Goodwill.
[27:03.080 --> 27:04.080]  I know exactly who you're talking about.
[27:04.080 --> 27:06.080]  I wondered if that's who you were going for.
[27:07.080 --> 27:12.080]  But he had a car that didn't match his wardrobe and odor.
[27:12.080 --> 27:21.080]  It was a better kept up early 2000s Corvette, I think.
[27:21.080 --> 27:26.080]  He's shopping, and he buys $6 worth of something or whatever.
[27:26.080 --> 27:31.080]  Not a lot of money worth of flour.
[27:31.080 --> 27:33.080]  My co-worker is stapling his bag shut.
[27:33.080 --> 27:36.080]  He goes, I just got new carpet in my trunk.
[27:36.080 --> 27:39.080]  And the two girls I'm working with are like, what an odd thing to say.
[27:39.080 --> 27:42.080]  Just kind of look at them, and they're like, oh, interesting.
[27:42.080 --> 27:45.080]  And he goes, you two want to come outside and smell it?
[27:45.080 --> 27:51.080]  And there was like three heartbeats where all three of us that were at work that night were like, he just fucking said smell it.
[27:51.080 --> 27:52.080]  He said smell it, not look at.
[27:52.080 --> 27:54.080]  He said smell.
[27:54.080 --> 27:57.080]  And just so smooth.
[27:58.080 --> 28:03.080]  Jess goes, no, sir, we're actually not allowed to leave the store until after closing.
[28:03.080 --> 28:04.080]  It's a rule.
[28:04.080 --> 28:06.080]  Just smooth as anything.
[28:06.080 --> 28:08.080]  I half believed it when she said it.
[28:08.080 --> 28:09.080]  Was she ever a stripper?
[28:09.080 --> 28:10.080]  That's like a stripper line.
[28:10.080 --> 28:11.080]  I have no idea.
[28:11.080 --> 28:16.080]  In what world would you go out to someone's car and even wait?
[28:16.080 --> 28:17.080]  No, no, no, no.
[28:17.080 --> 28:20.080]  I mean, like, OK, sniffing is really funny.
[28:20.080 --> 28:26.080]  But like, in what world would you even go and look at someone's new carpet in their trunk?
[28:26.080 --> 28:34.080]  You obviously just killed somebody and threw them in the trunk and got your carpet redone back there, and now you want me to go out there and be the next one.
[28:34.080 --> 28:35.080]  And you should keep it a secret.
[28:35.080 --> 28:36.080]  Don't tell anybody about it.
[28:36.080 --> 28:38.080]  Check out this trunk I just cleaned out.
[28:38.080 --> 28:39.080]  It was really dirty.
[28:39.080 --> 28:41.080]  Look, throws on the UV light.
[28:41.080 --> 28:43.080]  Look, you can't even see the spots anymore.
[28:45.080 --> 28:47.080]  Like, Jesus.
[28:47.080 --> 28:49.080]  Yeah, that one stands way out.
[28:49.080 --> 28:50.080]  Oh, man.
[28:50.080 --> 28:51.080]  That's terrible.
[28:51.080 --> 28:54.080]  Do you remember when people used to bring plants into Metamar that had problems?
[28:55.080 --> 28:56.080]  What's wrong with this?
[28:56.080 --> 29:01.080]  Yeah, he brought a big old plant in a fucking like a Walmart bag in a pot and a potted plant with leaves just sticking out.
[29:01.080 --> 29:04.080]  And he carries it in and he opens it up and it's all coated in powdery mildew.
[29:04.080 --> 29:05.080]  And he's like, what is this?
[29:05.080 --> 29:06.080]  I was like, get that the fuck out of here, bro.
[29:06.080 --> 29:07.080]  Like, we got plants.
[29:07.080 --> 29:08.080]  That's bad.
[29:08.080 --> 29:09.080]  Yeah.
[29:09.080 --> 29:10.080]  And I told him what it was.
[29:10.080 --> 29:12.080]  And I was like, that's only solvable by fire.
[29:12.080 --> 29:14.080]  Like, as bad as that is, that just needs fire.
[29:14.080 --> 29:15.080]  You just got to just.
[29:17.080 --> 29:23.080]  I remember you like just kind of mumbling under your breath like, fuck, dude, now I'm going to have to shower like three times before I can go see my wife.
[29:24.080 --> 29:36.080]  My garden chores done tonight because just one fool after another had brought in a potted plant with like a paper trash bag, like gently set over the little stand up support sticks so that they could kind of hide what they were.
[29:36.080 --> 29:42.080]  What kind of plant they were carrying in public view as they brought it into the dispensary to try to get us to diagnose it.
[29:43.080 --> 29:46.080]  Fucking people open it up, shit with spider mites on it.
[29:47.080 --> 29:50.080]  People leaving our place with clones and not giving a fuck.
[29:50.080 --> 29:51.080]  Just carry it.
[29:51.080 --> 29:54.080]  We sold clones in cups and you could buy if your plant count was 140.
[29:54.080 --> 29:55.080]  We'd say 140 clones.
[29:55.080 --> 29:57.080]  We didn't give a shit back in the day.
[29:57.080 --> 30:02.080]  And people would leave with just trays of clones in their hands, like six inch tall plants in cups, just carrying them out to the car.
[30:03.080 --> 30:04.080]  Like we didn't care at all.
[30:05.080 --> 30:12.080]  I remember one guy coming back like two or three days in a row, maybe six trips total and buying like two clones at a time.
[30:13.080 --> 30:20.080]  And when I asked him like what the hell is going on and he goes, I keep sending them out back so they get used to the light and the birds keep eating them.
[30:21.080 --> 30:23.080]  And I'm like dude, you're on clones like seven and eight.
[30:23.080 --> 30:24.080]  Like what the fuck?
[30:24.080 --> 30:26.080]  Come up with a plan bro.
[30:27.080 --> 30:32.080]  Get a shotgun, like get some chicken wire, put them inside, like something.
[30:33.080 --> 30:34.080]  Set it by the window?
[30:35.080 --> 30:53.080]  Speaking of bringing things into the dispensary, I'm friends with the person so I'm not going to say where or any of that, but somebody came into a place that I work and brought in a product that they wanted us to look at.
[30:54.080 --> 31:01.080]  And the entire dome on the pen was just like this color.
[31:02.080 --> 31:03.080]  Like bright orange?
[31:03.080 --> 31:09.080]  You know the like dome open globe, like open glass, could not even see it.
[31:09.080 --> 31:14.080]  And I was just like, you can't have that in here.
[31:15.080 --> 31:16.080]  Right, we are on camera.
[31:17.080 --> 31:20.080]  I have people pulling vaporizers out of their pocket left and right.
[31:21.080 --> 31:29.080]  I've got a weird bag of returned ones that we've got like receipts and like as much documentation as we can because we send them back to the company for replacement units.
[31:30.080 --> 31:32.080]  But half of them are like burnt out and a tiny bit dirty.
[31:33.080 --> 31:39.080]  And so we keep epic records on all of that shit just so that there's no, but that's a daily occurrence.
[31:39.080 --> 31:41.080]  People pulling shit like that out of their pocket.
[31:42.080 --> 31:47.080]  Mike, at the place you work, I got to be careful how I ask this.
[31:48.080 --> 31:49.080]  Do you get a prize for wearing a small shirt?
[31:50.080 --> 31:51.080]  Sometimes.
[31:52.080 --> 31:54.080]  It depends who's working.
[31:55.080 --> 31:57.080]  Yeah, that's some of the random shit that I've seen happen at that place.
[31:57.080 --> 31:59.080]  How crazy it is during that day.
[31:59.080 --> 32:04.080]  I mean, sometimes we'll see a couple hundred people in a day and weird things happen when it's that crazy.
[32:04.080 --> 32:09.080]  In the summer, if you shop at Mike's dispensary and you're in like a bikini, there's a good chance you'll get some gifts.
[32:10.080 --> 32:11.080]  A couple of free t-shirts.
[32:12.080 --> 32:20.080]  Yeah, it's funny when you watch all the dudes that work there, the older manager dudes try to stumble over Mike to get to the fucking young customers in a bikini.
[32:20.080 --> 32:21.080]  Those are TBBs.
[32:22.080 --> 32:27.080]  All right, so I'm going to tell a ridiculous story that happened to me one time when I worked at her dispensary.
[32:27.080 --> 32:32.080]  This will probably be the last one of these crazy stories for this episode because I thank you for listening.
[32:32.080 --> 32:41.080]  So one day I was working at work at the dispensary selling good old weed and it was myself and my receptionist is I guess what she would officially be.
[32:41.080 --> 32:42.080]  Her name was Tree.
[32:42.080 --> 32:48.080]  She probably weighed 90 pounds and was afraid of the wind.
[32:49.080 --> 32:51.080]  She was a very timid little chick.
[32:51.080 --> 32:52.080]  Not an imposing human.
[32:52.080 --> 32:57.080]  Yeah, and so one day a normal customer, there were regular customers that would come in.
[32:57.080 --> 32:59.080]  There was a lady, she wasn't even a lady.
[32:59.080 --> 33:01.080]  I'm not going to call her a lady because of what she did.
[33:01.080 --> 33:02.080]  She was a female.
[33:02.080 --> 33:06.080]  She was a large female and her husband was a dude who was about equal size with me.
[33:07.080 --> 33:09.080]  And they would come in often and I knew who they were.
[33:09.080 --> 33:14.080]  And one day she came in early in the morning and said, how much is an ounce?
[33:15.080 --> 33:18.080]  At the time at that dispensary an ounce was $320.
[33:18.080 --> 33:20.080]  And she said, if I come up with three, will you do it?
[33:20.080 --> 33:22.080]  And since she was a regular customer, I said, don't tell anybody.
[33:22.080 --> 33:24.080]  I'll hook you up for 300 bucks.
[33:24.080 --> 33:26.080]  I was like, you send your old man in later.
[33:26.080 --> 33:29.080]  I'll do it for three for him also because they got a baby and they switch shifts.
[33:29.080 --> 33:30.080]  And I just know how that should work.
[33:30.080 --> 33:36.080]  So she comes back later and she's got like 200 and I don't even remember how it goes.
[33:36.080 --> 33:38.080]  And she comes in like way later.
[33:38.080 --> 33:39.080]  We're about to close.
[33:39.080 --> 33:43.080]  And she comes back in and she's like, hey, sell me an ounce for like 250 or whatever.
[33:43.080 --> 33:44.080]  And I was like, no, I can't do it.
[33:44.080 --> 33:45.080]  I'll do it for three.
[33:45.080 --> 33:47.080]  Any less than that, I'll get in trouble.
[33:47.080 --> 33:49.080]  And she's like begging and I'm like, I can't do it.
[33:49.080 --> 33:52.080]  She's like, let me go out to the car and see what I can come up with.
[33:52.080 --> 33:56.080]  She goes out to the car and they're out there for a few minutes.
[33:56.080 --> 33:58.080]  And I asked her, I was like, what's going on?
[33:58.080 --> 33:59.080]  Because she can see the window and see their car.
[33:59.080 --> 34:01.080]  And she's like, they're kind of yelling at each other.
[34:01.080 --> 34:02.080]  They'll be back in in a minute.
[34:02.080 --> 34:03.080]  And I was like, cool.
[34:03.080 --> 34:04.080]  Give them a second.
[34:04.080 --> 34:08.080]  So he came in and she's like, I need to see your paperwork.
[34:08.080 --> 34:10.080]  You have to check in every time you come in.
[34:10.080 --> 34:11.080]  And he's like, nah, fuck that.
[34:11.080 --> 34:12.080]  I want to talk to that fucker.
[34:12.080 --> 34:14.080]  And I was like, oh, something's about to go on.
[34:14.080 --> 34:16.080]  And I know it was me that he wanted to talk to.
[34:16.080 --> 34:19.080]  He pushes past her and comes back to the bud room where I am,
[34:19.080 --> 34:21.080]  because we've got the bud room in the back of the building so we can get privacy.
[34:21.080 --> 34:26.080]  And he's like, motherfucker, you told my wife that if she sucks your dick,
[34:26.080 --> 34:28.080]  you'd give her an ounce for 200 bucks.
[34:28.080 --> 34:32.080]  And I was like, bro, I'm not interested in your wife.
[34:32.080 --> 34:33.080]  It's not my weed.
[34:33.080 --> 34:34.080]  I couldn't give her that anyway.
[34:34.080 --> 34:36.080]  And I'd never fucking say that to your wife.
[34:36.080 --> 34:37.080]  I was like, you guys are regulars here.
[34:37.080 --> 34:38.080]  I know who you are.
[34:38.080 --> 34:39.080]  Why the fuck would I do that?
[34:39.080 --> 34:41.080]  And honestly, I'm not even trying to be rude.
[34:41.080 --> 34:43.080]  She was not attractive.
[34:43.080 --> 34:47.080]  She was way, way not in my weight class.
[34:47.080 --> 34:49.080]  And I was like, no thanks.
[34:49.080 --> 34:53.080]  And so I was like, why would anybody want her to suck their dick?
[34:53.080 --> 34:55.080]  And so he's going off on me, dude.
[34:55.080 --> 34:57.080]  And he's like, I'm going to fuck you up.
[34:57.080 --> 34:58.080]  And he's kind of a big dude.
[34:58.080 --> 34:59.080]  He's my size.
[34:59.080 --> 35:00.080]  Like, I'm fucking 6'5".
[35:00.080 --> 35:01.080]  He had to be at least 6'3", or something.
[35:01.080 --> 35:02.080]  He was straight in my eye.
[35:02.080 --> 35:03.080]  He was on the other side of the counter.
[35:03.080 --> 35:04.080]  And he kept hitting the counter.
[35:04.080 --> 35:05.080]  And the counter is glass.
[35:05.080 --> 35:07.080]  And I was like, he's going to break this counter.
[35:07.080 --> 35:09.080]  Like, I've got to fucking figure this out quick.
[35:09.080 --> 35:11.080]  And Tree kept asking, do you want me to call the cops?
[35:11.080 --> 35:12.080]  Do you want me to call the cops?
[35:12.080 --> 35:13.080]  And I'm like, no.
[35:13.080 --> 35:15.080]  I don't want the cops at the dispensary.
[35:15.080 --> 35:16.080]  You know what I mean?
[35:16.080 --> 35:17.080]  That's like the last thing.
[35:17.080 --> 35:19.080]  I don't want to bring that to this business already.
[35:19.080 --> 35:23.080]  And so I've got mace and I've got some scissors within reach.
[35:23.080 --> 35:24.080]  Like, right within reach.
[35:24.080 --> 35:26.080]  And I was starting to get shaky.
[35:26.080 --> 35:28.080]  Like, I was getting that, like, I'm about to fight this motherfucker,
[35:28.080 --> 35:30.080]  is like the feeling that I had in my head.
[35:30.080 --> 35:32.080]  I was like, this shit's about to go down.
[35:32.080 --> 35:35.080]  And he's like, you motherfucker, you told my wife that if you sold her an ounce,
[35:35.080 --> 35:37.080]  you'd sell her an ounce if she sucked your dick.
[35:37.080 --> 35:39.080]  And then Tree starts yelling, I was right fucking here.
[35:39.080 --> 35:43.080]  All that's between Tree and I in the office in the bedroom is a tapestry.
[35:43.080 --> 35:45.080]  Honestly, that's all there was, was a black tapestry.
[35:45.080 --> 35:46.080]  And she's like, I was right here.
[35:46.080 --> 35:47.080]  He didn't fucking say any of that.
[35:47.080 --> 35:49.080]  She's like, I can hear everything.
[35:49.080 --> 35:51.080]  And he's like, fuck you.
[35:51.080 --> 35:54.080]  And finally, when he turned his head, I grabbed the mace and the scissors.
[35:54.080 --> 35:57.080]  I grabbed the mace with my right hand and the scissors with my left hand.
[35:57.080 --> 36:00.080]  And by now, his girlfriend came in too and was backing him up and left.
[36:00.080 --> 36:02.080]  They left the baby in the car.
[36:02.080 --> 36:05.080]  And so I told him, bro, you're kind of threatening me,
[36:05.080 --> 36:06.080]  and I'm not sure what to do about it.
[36:06.080 --> 36:08.080]  So I'm going to fucking mace you, and then I'm going to stab you,
[36:08.080 --> 36:10.080]  and then I'm going to mace your fucking wife,
[36:10.080 --> 36:12.080]  and then I'm going to call the cops if you guys don't get out of here.
[36:12.080 --> 36:16.080]  And Tree looked at me like, wow, I've never seen that side of you.
[36:16.080 --> 36:19.080]  Because everybody just knows me as this peaceful dude that grows weed
[36:19.080 --> 36:21.080]  and smokes a ton of weed and fucking is a bud tender,
[36:21.080 --> 36:23.080]  and I'm all laid back, and I show up like five minutes late,
[36:23.080 --> 36:25.080]  and I'm fucking cool with everything, I don't care.
[36:25.080 --> 36:28.080]  But right now, she sees me about to spray some dude in his face,
[36:28.080 --> 36:33.080]  stab him with fucking trim scissors, and then go after his girl with the mace.
[36:33.080 --> 36:36.080]  I think the only thing that saved me from fighting was when I told him,
[36:36.080 --> 36:40.080]  I'm going to spray you, stab you, and then I'm going to spray your girlfriend.
[36:40.080 --> 36:43.080]  She looked at him like, I don't want to get maced, baby.
[36:43.080 --> 36:45.080]  This idea ain't working no mo'.
[36:45.080 --> 36:48.080]  That's when it all kind of started to fucking cool down.
[36:48.080 --> 36:49.080]  But he's like, fuck you.
[36:49.080 --> 36:51.080]  I know where you work, and I'll find you.
[36:51.080 --> 36:53.080]  I was like, I'm here every day, buddy.
[36:53.080 --> 36:54.080]  But that was honest.
[36:54.080 --> 36:57.080]  I'm fucking like I've got a lot of adrenaline right now just telling that story.
[36:57.080 --> 36:59.080]  But I thought that dude and I were about to go down.
[36:59.080 --> 37:01.080]  It wasn't long after that we got the security guard.
[37:01.080 --> 37:06.080]  Yeah, well, I was like, bro, I can't be here by myself with fucking 20 pounds of weed.
[37:06.080 --> 37:09.080]  Because at that point, I mean, we were brand new,
[37:09.080 --> 37:13.080]  and we were getting like two calls a month from people that would say like
[37:13.080 --> 37:16.080]  random horrible shit into the phone because we were stealing their business.
[37:18.080 --> 37:20.080]  And they didn't like the idea of a dispensary in town.
[37:20.080 --> 37:22.080]  Like we should have had a security guard long before that.
[37:22.080 --> 37:25.080]  Yeah, and then the security guard we got was pretty funny.
[37:25.080 --> 37:26.080]  Yeah.
[37:26.080 --> 37:30.080]  One day I was driving down Northern Avenue, one of the main streets here in Pueblo,
[37:30.080 --> 37:33.080]  and I see the security guard.
[37:33.080 --> 37:35.080]  We're both going to Metamar to work.
[37:35.080 --> 37:38.080]  I'm the bud tender. He's got to get there at the same time as me because we open right when we get there.
[37:38.080 --> 37:39.080]  I know that story already.
[37:39.080 --> 37:41.080]  So we're driving down the street, and he pulls up next to me, and he goes,
[37:41.080 --> 37:43.080]  damn, I say that smells good.
[37:43.080 --> 37:46.080]  And I was smoking a big old fat ass joint on my way to work.
[37:46.080 --> 37:49.080]  And I took a big old hit off of it, and I was like, I'm high enough.
[37:49.080 --> 37:50.080]  Watch this. And I go, roll down your window.
[37:50.080 --> 37:52.080]  And he rolled down his window all the way.
[37:52.080 --> 37:54.080]  And I was in the right lane. He was in the left lane.
[37:54.080 --> 37:58.080]  He put his hand out, and I threw that fucking joint from my car
[37:58.080 --> 38:00.080]  into his passenger window directly into his hand.
[38:00.080 --> 38:04.080]  He caught that fucker and didn't have to make adjustments and just hit it.
[38:04.080 --> 38:06.080]  It was so smooth.
[38:06.080 --> 38:09.080]  They were so happy when they got to work that day.
[38:09.080 --> 38:11.080]  It was like Voltron just united, bro.
[38:11.080 --> 38:14.080]  We came together on that shit. It was beautiful.
[38:14.080 --> 38:16.080]  All right, you guys.
[38:16.080 --> 38:18.080]  I told my craziest story that I can think of.
[38:18.080 --> 38:21.080]  What's up? We didn't cover events really.
[38:21.080 --> 38:23.080]  I've seen people black the fuck out.
[38:23.080 --> 38:24.080]  Yeah, that's really the worst.
[38:24.080 --> 38:27.080]  My friend Katrina took a dab, and she looked at me, and she goes,
[38:27.080 --> 38:30.080]  I'm so hungry, and just fell the fuck over, dude.
[38:30.080 --> 38:32.080]  I caught her.
[38:32.080 --> 38:36.080]  But we stayed in a really swanky hotel the night before, and they had free lotion.
[38:36.080 --> 38:38.080]  And she lubed herself up in all the damn lotion.
[38:38.080 --> 38:39.080]  She used it all.
[38:39.080 --> 38:42.080]  So I tried to catch her, and it was trying to like catch a fucking –
[38:42.080 --> 38:43.080]  She slid right through.
[38:43.080 --> 38:45.080]  She just slid right out of my arms.
[38:45.080 --> 38:46.080]  I was like, God damn it.
[38:46.080 --> 38:47.080]  So I had to catch her like three times.
[38:47.080 --> 38:50.080]  And then I finally got her all awkward, and Tony was with me.
[38:50.080 --> 38:52.080]  And I go, Tony, just pick her up and put her on my shoulders, bro,
[38:52.080 --> 38:55.080]  because I was holding her just like – she was like a wet noodle.
[38:55.080 --> 38:57.080]  And so he spun her around and threw her up on my shoulders.
[38:57.080 --> 39:01.080]  And I got her, and I spun her around, and I told him, pour this water on her face.
[39:01.080 --> 39:03.080]  I just gave him water, and he was like pouring water into her mouth,
[39:03.080 --> 39:05.080]  and she started drinking it and woke up.
[39:05.080 --> 39:06.080]  And I set her down.
[39:06.080 --> 39:08.080]  She goes, how long was I asleep?
[39:08.080 --> 39:11.080]  And I was like, that was pretty funny.
[39:11.080 --> 39:13.080]  She was all pale and shit for the rest of the day.
[39:13.080 --> 39:15.080]  They had to feed her twice.
[39:15.080 --> 39:19.080]  This dude from Texas one time, I took a fat dab, a fat, fat dab at the Cannabis Cup.
[39:19.080 --> 39:23.080]  The first one that they did at the new location – what's the new place?
[39:23.080 --> 39:24.080]  Denver Mart.
[39:24.080 --> 39:25.080]  Denver Mart.
[39:25.080 --> 39:26.080]  That was the old location.
[39:26.080 --> 39:27.080]  Yeah, right.
[39:27.080 --> 39:28.080]  Oh, shit.
[39:28.080 --> 39:31.080]  Did a big old fat dab, and this guy came up, and he was from Texas.
[39:31.080 --> 39:32.080]  He's all, what y'all doing right there?
[39:32.080 --> 39:33.080]  And I was like, it's dabs.
[39:33.080 --> 39:34.080]  He's like, damn, I heard about dabs.
[39:34.080 --> 39:35.080]  I ain't done that yet.
[39:35.080 --> 39:36.080]  Can I get a dab?
[39:36.080 --> 39:37.080]  And I tried to give him a little dab.
[39:37.080 --> 39:38.080]  And I've told this story on the podcast before.
[39:38.080 --> 39:41.080]  I tried to give him a little dab, and he's like, nah, I saw you do one.
[39:41.080 --> 39:42.080]  I want a big one like you did.
[39:42.080 --> 39:46.080]  And I was like, I don't think you want to do your first dab like a Rasta Jeff size dab.
[39:46.080 --> 39:48.080]  He's like, give me a damn old dab.
[39:48.080 --> 39:50.080]  And I was like, you're going to get a dang old dab, sir.
[39:50.080 --> 39:51.080]  Here you go.
[39:51.080 --> 39:52.080]  And so I hooked him up.
[39:52.080 --> 39:53.080]  And that dude took a dab.
[39:53.080 --> 39:57.080]  And by the time the last of the smoke hit his lungs, I'm pretty sure part of the dab
[39:57.080 --> 40:00.080]  came out of that sinus part of your eye, like where your eye and your nose meets.
[40:00.080 --> 40:01.080]  Smoke came out there.
[40:01.080 --> 40:02.080]  Smoke came out of his ears.
[40:02.080 --> 40:04.080]  Smoke came out of his nose.
[40:04.080 --> 40:05.080]  Smoke came out of his mouth.
[40:05.080 --> 40:08.080]  If you took off his pants, I'm pretty sure some smoke was coming out of his butthole,
[40:08.080 --> 40:11.080]  because that dude was just, he just blew up with smoke.
[40:11.080 --> 40:13.080]  And he looked at me and vanished.
[40:13.080 --> 40:14.080]  I don't know where the fuck he went.
[40:14.080 --> 40:16.080]  I don't know what happened to that dude.
[40:16.080 --> 40:17.080]  He just levitated into nowhere.
[40:17.080 --> 40:18.080]  He was gone, bro.
[40:19.080 --> 40:20.080]  That shit was so funny.
[40:20.080 --> 40:21.080]  Went back to his car.
[40:21.080 --> 40:22.080]  Probably.
[40:22.080 --> 40:23.080]  Left instantly.
[40:23.080 --> 40:24.080]  Yeah, drove right back, went and slept in the car.
[40:24.080 --> 40:27.080]  Yeah, just went right out to his car and was like, what the hell was that?
[40:27.080 --> 40:29.080]  What did that wookie just give me?
[40:29.080 --> 40:31.080]  And then he drove to Texas and told everybody about it.
[40:31.080 --> 40:32.080]  Yeah, Ross the Wizard.
[40:32.080 --> 40:34.080]  Ross the Wizard, oh shit.
[40:34.080 --> 40:36.080]  Sometimes there'd be a nice offering of a tiny dab.
[40:36.080 --> 40:39.080]  Yeah, you don't have to take heroic dabs just because I do.
[40:39.080 --> 40:40.080]  Don't mean you need to do it.
[40:40.080 --> 40:41.080]  Speaking of dabs.
[40:41.080 --> 40:42.080]  Yeah, you have to do it all the time.
[40:42.080 --> 40:46.080]  Shout out to my friends at Turpex for the lovely work with the Cascade Shatter.
[40:47.080 --> 40:50.080]  Shouldn't even talk about it on the show since it's all sold the fuck out.
[40:50.080 --> 40:53.080]  The Terps, oh my God, you guys want to talk about these Terps for a minute?
[40:53.080 --> 40:56.080]  I've been talking about the Terps for a couple few episodes now.
[40:56.080 --> 40:57.080]  I'm amazed that they're still around.
[40:57.080 --> 40:58.080]  Sorry, I'm wiggling my head funny.
[40:58.080 --> 40:59.080]  My hat is pulling my dread.
[40:59.080 --> 41:00.080]  I need to fix that.
[41:00.080 --> 41:02.080]  It's not a large container, but it lasts for a second.
[41:02.080 --> 41:03.080]  These Terps are amazing.
[41:03.080 --> 41:05.080]  Did you guys get to try the Lemon G?
[41:05.080 --> 41:06.080]  Yes.
[41:06.080 --> 41:07.080]  Did you get to try the OG Kush?
[41:07.080 --> 41:08.080]  I have not actually tried the Lemon G.
[41:08.080 --> 41:11.080]  I don't think I tried the OG Kush.
[41:11.080 --> 41:12.080]  No?
[41:12.080 --> 41:14.080]  We may have to do some dunking and dipping here.
[41:14.080 --> 41:15.080]  Is that Soba Ghost, Ryan?
[41:15.080 --> 41:16.080]  Yes, yesterday.
[41:16.080 --> 41:18.080]  You're going to have to lick the bottle if you want to taste that.
[41:18.080 --> 41:21.080]  I've tried the Ghost, but the Lemon G I've heard about but haven't tried.
[41:21.080 --> 41:22.080]  The Ghost was wonderful.
[41:22.080 --> 41:24.080]  We were talking about ways to use it earlier.
[41:24.080 --> 41:35.080]  I really like pouring the OG Kush Terps onto solventless hash, like the 120 micron cream or blue sherb hash.
[41:35.080 --> 41:36.080]  Yeah, just press out.
[41:36.080 --> 41:38.080]  See how this one's pressed right here?
[41:38.080 --> 41:39.080]  There's like a little patty.
[41:39.080 --> 41:41.080]  Just pour a little drip on there.
[41:41.080 --> 41:42.080]  It's pretty thick.
[41:42.080 --> 41:47.080]  The Terps are pretty thick and kind of viscous, so you've got to pour quickly or it'll run down the side of the bottle.
[41:47.080 --> 41:51.080]  You've got to learn to get the angle going, but I really love pouring it on the fucking solventless.
[41:51.080 --> 41:57.080]  I poured some onto just a little piece of shatter the other day so that I had a whole piece of shatter with some on it.
[41:57.080 --> 42:04.080]  And, of course, some dripped onto the oil slick, so I was dipping it up using shatter and solventless and whatever I was smoking, just rubbing it in on the oil slick.
[42:05.080 --> 42:12.080]  My favorite way, honestly, is to get a small-ish dab and then just dunk it right into the Terps and don't even go too hard.
[42:12.080 --> 42:14.080]  Just a little bit of Terps and then just smoke it that way.
[42:14.080 --> 42:19.080]  I actually dropped a little bit of the Ghost-Trained Haze Terps directly onto the e-nail head.
[42:19.080 --> 42:26.080]  It made the next five or six or eight dabs taste real terpy, but it didn't last as long as I had hoped for.
[42:27.080 --> 42:30.080]  Lins, you work at the store where we're selling this medically.
[42:30.080 --> 42:34.080]  What are these going for for a quarter of a gram now? Do you remember?
[42:34.080 --> 42:35.080]  I think 60.
[42:35.080 --> 42:38.080]  I think you're right. I think they're 60 bucks a quarter gram right now.
[42:38.080 --> 42:40.080]  I think 65 for non-members.
[42:40.080 --> 42:43.080]  65 for non-members. Just be a member. I don't know what you're thinking. You can get the blue shirt.
[42:43.080 --> 42:44.080]  You can get the cream.
[42:44.080 --> 42:45.080]  Sign up.
[42:45.080 --> 42:48.080]  I grew all that shit. You want it? Just come and get it.
[42:48.080 --> 42:51.080]  The Terps. The Terps are fucking amazing. You can get the Terps.
[42:51.080 --> 42:55.080]  If you're a rec shopper, you can get the Terps at Natty Rem's call before you drive because I don't know what they've got.
[42:55.080 --> 42:58.080]  You guys, when this episode comes out, they could be cleaned out. They could laugh at you.
[42:58.080 --> 43:01.080]  They could be like, Terps, that was a few weeks ago. Good fucking luck.
[43:01.080 --> 43:11.080]  But shout out to the crew that's making the Terps. Shout out to the EvoLab crew because we've seen a lot of really cool cannabis products come out in the past year, past two years, past whatever.
[43:11.080 --> 43:18.080]  And this one might be my favorite. The Terps. This might be the newest, greatest thing to come out in cannabis.
[43:18.080 --> 43:20.080]  What do you think, Mike?
[43:20.080 --> 43:28.080]  There's been some stuff recently that's been impressive, but this kind of took it to a new place. A very fun new place.
[43:28.080 --> 43:31.080]  A very connoisseur level. I like getting, I do like playing with the distillate.
[43:31.080 --> 43:38.080]  I like taking the distillate, the just raw distillate, it's just 91% THC and get a little tiny dab of that.
[43:38.080 --> 43:42.080]  And I like to dip it into the OG Kush and then maybe put it in the Lemon G after that.
[43:42.080 --> 43:45.080]  And then maybe rub it on the Ghost Rain Haze and just see what the different mixtures do.
[43:45.080 --> 43:49.080]  But that, honestly, that got old quickly. It was fun a few times.
[43:49.080 --> 43:55.080]  It was like mixing jelly bellies. You know what I'm saying? It's fun. But then you're like, eh, I did that.
[43:55.080 --> 44:01.080]  I've been having some fun mixing random hashes together, playing with the different flavor profiles.
[44:01.080 --> 44:03.080]  Terp tacos.
[44:03.080 --> 44:04.080]  Combined.
[44:04.080 --> 44:06.080]  Combined it was good, bro. Go with it.
[44:06.080 --> 44:12.080]  I'm looking down this table, folks, and there's like 12 different varieties of hash. There's three different vials of Terps.
[44:12.080 --> 44:14.080]  Four vials of Terps.
[44:14.080 --> 44:15.080]  Four vials of Terps.
[44:15.080 --> 44:16.080]  You just can't see one.
[44:16.080 --> 44:17.080]  Get it right.
[44:17.080 --> 44:20.080]  Insanely delicious and distracting.
[44:20.080 --> 44:22.080]  It's a dabalicious table.
[44:22.080 --> 44:27.080]  It is. And I've got this beautiful little pancake of solventless that's been taunting me this whole episode.
[44:27.080 --> 44:30.080]  If you smoke that whole thing, you may not speak the rest of the episode.
[44:30.080 --> 44:36.080]  No, that's like at least 10 Mike dabs on that little pancake, which is funny because that's like a quarter Jeff dab.
[44:36.080 --> 44:37.080]  Yeah.
[44:37.080 --> 44:38.080]  Easily.
[44:38.080 --> 44:41.080]  I'd put a drop of OG Kush Terps on it and that'd be one fedulary stab.
[44:41.080 --> 44:47.080]  I was talking about dripping Terps on it and I looked down and went, ooh, God, sexier.
[44:47.080 --> 44:49.080]  And that's where combined it came from.
[44:49.080 --> 44:51.080]  It's like giving hash a boob job.
[44:51.080 --> 44:53.080]  Put some Terps on it.
[44:53.080 --> 44:55.080]  It's like putting wheels on that motherfucker.
[44:55.080 --> 44:57.080]  Put some rams on it.
[44:57.080 --> 45:00.080]  They don't got to be spinners, bro.
[45:00.080 --> 45:02.080]  No one needs spinners anymore.
[45:02.080 --> 45:04.080]  What kind of a 90s color are you?
[45:04.080 --> 45:07.080]  Now they whistle.
[45:07.080 --> 45:08.080]  All right.
[45:08.080 --> 45:11.080]  Uh, bubble, you got anything to add to this wonderful podcast?
[45:11.080 --> 45:12.080]  Not much, man.
[45:12.080 --> 45:13.080]  Thanks for the furniture table.
[45:13.080 --> 45:14.080]  Make sure you guys check out.
[45:14.080 --> 45:19.080]  Is it big cartel dot furniture dot com or is it furniture dot big cartel dot com.
[45:19.080 --> 45:20.080]  All right.
[45:20.080 --> 45:21.080]  So furniture dot big cartel dot com.
[45:21.080 --> 45:22.080]  Check that shit out.
[45:22.080 --> 45:23.080]  Support it.
[45:23.080 --> 45:24.080]  Order a custom table.
[45:24.080 --> 45:25.080]  Do yes.
[45:25.080 --> 45:27.080]  He's a bad mo for a contact him for custom art.
[45:27.080 --> 45:28.080]  A whole bunch of email furniture.
[45:28.080 --> 45:29.080]  Definitely.
[45:29.080 --> 45:30.080]  Go check out the site.
[45:30.080 --> 45:32.080]  How long ago did you hook me up with that email table?
[45:32.080 --> 45:33.080]  It's been a while now.
[45:33.080 --> 45:34.080]  It's been over a year.
[45:34.080 --> 45:35.080]  Yeah, easily.
[45:35.080 --> 45:36.080]  And it works.
[45:36.080 --> 45:37.080]  I'm not saying I've got no problems.
[45:37.080 --> 45:38.080]  The coils are still good.
[45:38.080 --> 45:39.080]  The workhorse.
[45:39.080 --> 45:42.080]  And it's like one of the, one of the originals to the paint.
[45:42.080 --> 45:44.080]  The paint needs a hug.
[45:44.080 --> 45:48.080]  But I mean, everything else is got some miles on those tires now.
[45:48.080 --> 45:49.080]  Yeah.
[45:49.080 --> 45:50.080]  We've, we've done a lot of videos.
[45:50.080 --> 45:51.080]  That's why I sent it here.
[45:51.080 --> 45:54.080]  I sent it here to make sure it got put to work.
[45:54.080 --> 45:58.080]  That was like, that was like, I literally, that was probably like the third or fourth
[45:58.080 --> 45:59.080]  one.
[45:59.080 --> 46:01.080]  And I was like, I'm going to send it to Jeff because I know much appreciated.
[46:01.080 --> 46:02.080]  It got a lot of use.
[46:02.080 --> 46:03.080]  It's got a lot of miles on it.
[46:03.080 --> 46:06.080]  The coils are still working and I'm amazed because I've used a couple of coils on this
[46:06.080 --> 46:08.080]  unit here and the same amount of time.
[46:08.080 --> 46:09.080]  I don't know.
[46:09.080 --> 46:10.080]  These coils aren't as good.
[46:10.080 --> 46:12.080]  I don't think I like the ones that look more like a microphone.
[46:12.080 --> 46:15.080]  You guys, if you're buying an email, get the one with the coil that looks like a microphone
[46:15.080 --> 46:18.080]  cable, not the one that XLR.
[46:18.080 --> 46:19.080]  Yeah.
[46:19.080 --> 46:20.080]  It looks like an XLR cable, not the other one.
[46:20.080 --> 46:21.080]  You'll know what I'm talking about.
[46:21.080 --> 46:24.080]  If it doesn't look like an XLR, that's not the one I'm talking about.
[46:24.080 --> 46:25.080]  Don't do it.
[46:25.080 --> 46:26.080]  Five 10.
[46:26.080 --> 46:27.080]  Lindsay, you're right.
[46:27.080 --> 46:28.080]  Yeah.
[46:28.080 --> 46:32.080]  I was just thinking to myself that I remember when you were making that table in Florida
[46:33.080 --> 46:37.080]  like I remember you and I trying to figure out how you were going to paint it and you
[46:37.080 --> 46:39.080]  doing the tape on the top.
[46:39.080 --> 46:40.080]  Yeah.
[46:40.080 --> 46:44.080]  And the tape when you pulled it off or whatever.
[46:44.080 --> 46:49.080]  And that's the reason you painted it because you originally were going to do something
[46:49.080 --> 46:50.080]  on it.
[46:50.080 --> 46:55.080]  And when you pulled up the paint of pinstripe around it, that's right.
[46:55.080 --> 47:00.080]  And then when you put the tape down and you pulled it up, it fucked up and you were like,
[47:01.080 --> 47:02.080]  that's it.
[47:02.080 --> 47:04.080]  I'm just going to do Jeff's thing on there.
[47:04.080 --> 47:05.080]  Now I'm going balls deep.
[47:05.080 --> 47:06.080]  I did it.
[47:06.080 --> 47:08.080]  A really dope unboxing video on Periscope.
[47:08.080 --> 47:10.080]  And yeah, I remember I watched that.
[47:10.080 --> 47:11.080]  Yeah.
[47:11.080 --> 47:15.080]  I was actually at her job, I think, or I was walking in your job.
[47:15.080 --> 47:17.080]  And we watched it when I was at the small shop.
[47:17.080 --> 47:18.080]  Because I was like driving.
[47:18.080 --> 47:19.080]  I was like, well, Jeff just got it.
[47:19.080 --> 47:20.080]  Sweet.
[47:20.080 --> 47:21.080]  Gotta watch it.
[47:21.080 --> 47:22.080]  The video may be on YouTube.
[47:22.080 --> 47:23.080]  I'm not sure.
[47:23.080 --> 47:24.080]  I can't promise you.
[47:24.080 --> 47:26.080]  The unboxing video could be up there.
[47:26.080 --> 47:27.080]  Yeah.
[47:27.080 --> 47:28.080]  I think you.
[47:28.080 --> 47:29.080]  Oh, Lindsay needs a nap.
[47:29.080 --> 47:30.080]  I really do.
[47:30.080 --> 47:31.080]  Good morning, sunshine.
[47:31.080 --> 47:32.080]  Sorry we woke you up for this.
[47:32.080 --> 47:33.080]  What was it?
[47:33.080 --> 47:34.080]  Five or 600 or four or 500?
[47:34.080 --> 47:35.080]  Four or 500.
[47:35.080 --> 47:36.080]  Still.
[47:36.080 --> 47:37.080]  Doing all right, though, for 500 milligrams.
[47:37.080 --> 47:38.080]  Damn.
[47:38.080 --> 47:39.080]  Yeah.
[47:39.080 --> 47:40.080]  I ate.
[47:40.080 --> 47:41.080]  That's a power nap.
[47:41.080 --> 47:42.080]  Yeah, I was going to say, I had a power nap.
[47:42.080 --> 47:46.080]  I probably used about somewhere between like eight and 1200 milligrams of THC during the
[47:46.080 --> 47:47.080]  last secret sesh.
[47:47.080 --> 47:48.080]  And that was on what, 421?
[47:48.080 --> 47:49.080]  No.
[47:49.080 --> 47:50.080]  No, what the fuck was that one?
[47:50.080 --> 47:51.080]  The last one we had in May.
[47:51.080 --> 47:52.080]  May.
[47:52.080 --> 47:53.080]  May 23rd, I think.
[47:53.080 --> 47:54.080]  Maybe something-ish.
[47:54.080 --> 47:55.080]  It was in May, damn it.
[47:55.080 --> 47:56.080]  I don't care what date it was.
[47:56.080 --> 47:57.080]  That day, I ate a whole bunch.
[47:58.080 --> 48:01.080]  And then somebody gave me a thousand milligram edible at that event, and I ate that the next
[48:01.080 --> 48:02.080]  day.
[48:02.080 --> 48:06.080]  Yeah, I actually ended up getting one of those, and I'm mad because I've been wanting to eat
[48:06.080 --> 48:10.080]  a thousand, and I didn't because she ended up like, whoa.
[48:10.080 --> 48:11.080]  No, wait.
[48:11.080 --> 48:12.080]  Let me tell you this story.
[48:12.080 --> 48:13.080]  Bro, honest?
[48:13.080 --> 48:14.080]  No, no, no, let me tell you this story.
[48:14.080 --> 48:15.080]  It's okay.
[48:15.080 --> 48:16.080]  Let me tell you this story.
[48:16.080 --> 48:21.080]  I gave him this thousand milligram bar, and I was like, yo, surprise, I finally got you
[48:21.080 --> 48:24.080]  one that we've been talking about forever.
[48:24.080 --> 48:26.080]  What does this idiot do?
[48:26.080 --> 48:27.080]  He opens it.
[48:27.080 --> 48:29.080]  He's like, oh, sweet.
[48:29.080 --> 48:36.080]  Grabs it from me, opens it up, breaks off two of them, throws it in his mouth immediately.
[48:36.080 --> 48:38.080]  No warning.
[48:38.080 --> 48:43.080]  And he's like three bites in, he looks over at me all wide-eyed, he's like, oh, why did
[48:43.080 --> 48:44.080]  I do that?
[48:44.080 --> 48:45.080]  It's a habit.
[48:45.080 --> 48:47.080]  I have no idea why you did that.
[48:47.080 --> 48:48.080]  I smelled it.
[48:48.080 --> 48:49.080]  I was like, oh, it smells so good.
[48:49.080 --> 48:50.080]  Oh, let me just try this.
[48:50.080 --> 48:51.080]  And I was like, why did I eat this?
[48:51.080 --> 48:54.080]  I just want to eat all this right now, and I can right now.
[48:54.080 --> 48:55.080]  I did.
[48:55.080 --> 48:56.080]  I know.
[48:56.080 --> 48:58.080]  I kind of wish I would not have.
[48:58.080 --> 48:59.080]  Ankle weights on your brain, right?
[48:59.080 --> 49:00.080]  Isn't that how you described it?
[49:00.080 --> 49:01.080]  That's what it felt like.
[49:01.080 --> 49:03.080]  Yes, on Facebook I said it's like ankle weights for your brain.
[49:03.080 --> 49:04.080]  That was so hash-y.
[49:04.080 --> 49:05.080]  Dude.
[49:05.080 --> 49:06.080]  It was.
[49:06.080 --> 49:07.080]  That was the most hash-tastic.
[49:07.080 --> 49:09.080]  It was like my teeth were sticking together.
[49:09.080 --> 49:10.080]  They were making this like a...
[49:10.080 --> 49:11.080]  Oh, half...
[49:11.080 --> 49:12.080]  Well, that would pull my teeth apart.
[49:12.080 --> 49:13.080]  It would make a clicking noise.
[49:13.080 --> 49:14.080]  A sticking noise.
[49:14.080 --> 49:15.080]  Yeah.
[49:15.080 --> 49:18.080]  Half pieces were really hash-y, so like I think, you know.
[49:18.080 --> 49:20.080]  I was eating it while I was driving, so I was just pounding it.
[49:20.080 --> 49:22.080]  I hate it when they're hash-y, but they almost have to.
[49:22.080 --> 49:23.080]  That's exactly what I did.
[49:24.080 --> 49:25.080]  It was like...
[49:25.080 --> 49:26.080]  You can taste it.
[49:26.080 --> 49:29.080]  They told me Max...
[49:29.080 --> 49:30.080]  What's the fucking dude's name?
[49:30.080 --> 49:31.080]  Max, right?
[49:31.080 --> 49:34.080]  He told me he put a gram and a half of Cheddar in each bar.
[49:34.080 --> 49:37.080]  So that means I ate a gram and a half of Cheddar in a chocolate bar
[49:37.080 --> 49:39.080]  that was really no bigger than an iPhone.
[49:39.080 --> 49:41.080]  So there's like six pieces, I think.
[49:41.080 --> 49:42.080]  Yeah.
[49:42.080 --> 49:43.080]  No, there's eight pieces.
[49:43.080 --> 49:44.080]  It was...
[49:44.080 --> 49:45.080]  Wow, wait.
[49:45.080 --> 49:47.080]  If it's a gram and a half, then isn't that more than a thousand?
[49:47.080 --> 49:49.080]  Well, no, because that's something that we should talk about on the podcast
[49:49.080 --> 49:51.080]  when we have a lot more time to get out of it.
[49:51.080 --> 49:52.080]  Oh, that's right.
[49:52.080 --> 49:53.080]  It's a gram of hash.
[49:53.080 --> 49:55.080]  If you test this hash, this is not 100% THC.
[49:55.080 --> 49:58.080]  This is probably in the high 80s, so they threw a gram and a half in there
[49:58.080 --> 49:59.080]  and they're calling it...
[49:59.080 --> 50:00.080]  To make it...
[50:00.080 --> 50:01.080]  Okay.
[50:01.080 --> 50:02.080]  Yeah.
[50:02.080 --> 50:03.080]  So it's a much truer...
[50:03.080 --> 50:04.080]  Ballpark.
[50:04.080 --> 50:05.080]  Yeah.
[50:05.080 --> 50:08.080]  They couldn't be tested by the MED and they aren't an MED product.
[50:08.080 --> 50:11.080]  These are just somebody's basement brew.
[50:11.080 --> 50:12.080]  Right.
[50:12.080 --> 50:13.080]  Home concoctions.
[50:13.080 --> 50:16.080]  I miss the days when anyone could use lab testing.
[50:16.080 --> 50:20.080]  We only had those days for about two and a half, three months.
[50:20.080 --> 50:21.080]  Shout out to Steep Hill.
[50:21.080 --> 50:22.080]  It was a beautiful chunk of time.
[50:22.080 --> 50:24.080]  Big shout out to Adison and John Hunt.
[50:24.080 --> 50:26.080]  Big shout out to the...
[50:26.080 --> 50:27.080]  And the...
[50:27.080 --> 50:28.080]  Yes, yes.
[50:28.080 --> 50:30.080]  Fuck, I totally wish I could remember the chemist's name,
[50:30.080 --> 50:32.080]  the scientist that I met when...
[50:32.080 --> 50:33.080]  I know his name.
[50:33.080 --> 50:34.080]  It's right on the tip of my tongue.
[50:34.080 --> 50:35.080]  Damn it.
[50:35.080 --> 50:37.080]  As soon as we quit recording, I'm going to yell his name out loud.
[50:37.080 --> 50:38.080]  Man, he was a cool dude.
[50:38.080 --> 50:40.080]  The scientist I met at Steep Hill, he really taught me a lot of stuff
[50:40.080 --> 50:42.080]  in the short amount of time we hung out.
[50:42.080 --> 50:44.080]  Steep Hill was the first group...
[50:44.080 --> 50:47.080]  I mean, way back at the first KushCon,
[50:47.080 --> 50:50.080]  they had the saddest little booth at the show
[50:50.080 --> 50:53.080]  with the coolest information pack.
[50:54.080 --> 50:57.080]  They were the first people I really saw breaking down
[50:57.080 --> 51:00.080]  cannabis testing past THC.
[51:01.080 --> 51:04.080]  They were advertising pesticides, heavy metals,
[51:04.080 --> 51:07.080]  like 12 different cannabinoids at that point.
[51:07.080 --> 51:08.080]  And I just...
[51:08.080 --> 51:10.080]  It was one of those things where you saw,
[51:10.080 --> 51:12.080]  oh, that's where the industry's going to go.
[51:12.080 --> 51:15.080]  This is going to open up all new avenues,
[51:15.080 --> 51:18.080]  insurer shit, potency jumped 20%,
[51:18.080 --> 51:22.080]  quality went up, I mean, an incalculable amount
[51:22.080 --> 51:24.080]  right after the lab showed up.
[51:24.080 --> 51:27.080]  Shout out to Johnny Trill and Trill Gardens.
[51:27.080 --> 51:29.080]  They had their shit tested.
[51:29.080 --> 51:32.080]  Zero traces of any pesticides in all of their products.
[51:32.080 --> 51:33.080]  Nice.
[51:33.080 --> 51:34.080]  Yeah, big shout out to those kids.
[51:34.080 --> 51:35.080]  That's how it's done.
[51:35.080 --> 51:37.080]  I saw a test like that on Facebook recently.
[51:37.080 --> 51:38.080]  I think that's the same test I'm talking about.
[51:38.080 --> 51:39.080]  Probably.
[51:39.080 --> 51:40.080]  Yeah, yeah.
[51:40.080 --> 51:41.080]  So I was getting around to...
[51:41.080 --> 51:44.080]  I haven't eaten edibles since that thousand milligram
[51:44.080 --> 51:45.080]  because I'm a little scared.
[51:45.080 --> 51:46.080]  Oh, yeah.
[51:46.080 --> 51:47.080]  I fell off the horse.
[51:47.080 --> 51:49.080]  I ain't got back on yet.
[51:49.080 --> 51:53.080]  Actually, I've been highly into edibles lately,
[51:53.080 --> 51:56.080]  ever since I went to Florida.
[51:56.080 --> 51:59.080]  I over roasted myself with them when I went to see Deadpool
[51:59.080 --> 52:01.080]  and I've been going real light since.
[52:01.080 --> 52:03.080]  I just need her to reset for a little while.
[52:03.080 --> 52:04.080]  I just need her to admit it.
[52:04.080 --> 52:05.080]  I'll probably eat a whole bunch of edibles again
[52:05.080 --> 52:06.080]  at the next Secret Sesh.
[52:06.080 --> 52:07.080]  Yeah.
[52:07.080 --> 52:09.080]  I wonder if this podcast comes out before then.
[52:09.080 --> 52:12.080]  No, this podcast will not be out by the time Secret Sesh happens.
[52:12.080 --> 52:14.080]  And if it did, we will do a review of it.
[52:14.080 --> 52:17.080]  Everyone looks through their phone to see how many days until this episode,
[52:17.080 --> 52:18.080]  how many until Secret Sesh.
[52:18.080 --> 52:20.080]  Let's do quick math on our fingers.
[52:20.080 --> 52:22.080]  I don't even know, but check out Secret Sesh.
[52:22.080 --> 52:25.080]  The only way to get into a Secret Sesh is to follow the instructions on Instagram.
[52:25.080 --> 52:26.080]  Follow instructions.
[52:26.080 --> 52:28.080]  So either if it's already happened or not,
[52:28.080 --> 52:32.080]  check out at Secret Sesh underscore CO on Instagram.
[52:32.080 --> 52:34.080]  And if you ever want to come join us,
[52:34.080 --> 52:35.080]  the instructions will be posted there.
[52:35.080 --> 52:36.080]  Follow the instructions.
[52:36.080 --> 52:38.080]  If you fuck it up, you won't get to go.
[52:38.080 --> 52:40.080]  It's just a simple email.
[52:40.080 --> 52:41.080]  You got to follow the instructions.
[52:41.080 --> 52:44.080]  A lot of people do something stupidly wrong and then like,
[52:44.080 --> 52:45.080]  why didn't I get my tickets?
[52:45.080 --> 52:47.080]  And then we go look at their email and like,
[52:47.080 --> 52:48.080]  cause you didn't put your name on it.
[52:48.080 --> 52:50.080]  They didn't show your ID like you're supposed to.
[52:50.080 --> 52:53.080]  So yeah, you just got to do this shit properly and you will get in.
[52:53.080 --> 52:55.080]  All right.
[52:55.080 --> 52:56.080]  Shout out to the Secret Sesh.
[52:56.080 --> 52:57.080]  We just went quiet.
[52:57.080 --> 52:58.080]  For sure.
[52:58.080 --> 53:00.080]  Lindsay, you got any more useful information for this podcast?
[53:00.080 --> 53:01.080]  No, not really.
[53:01.080 --> 53:06.080]  I mean, I have like a thousand stories I can tell you of just obscene things
[53:06.080 --> 53:09.080]  people have said and done, but you know.
[53:09.080 --> 53:12.080]  Like when people ridiculously blatantly just flirt with you.
[53:12.080 --> 53:14.080]  Yeah, there's that.
[53:14.080 --> 53:17.080]  There's when I was working in the smoke shop,
[53:17.080 --> 53:21.080]  I had someone come in and be like, oh, are you the trap queen?
[53:21.080 --> 53:22.080]  What?
[53:22.080 --> 53:23.080]  No.
[53:23.080 --> 53:25.080]  Shout out to my boy Sloppy for making a really great joke on the dispensary
[53:25.080 --> 53:26.080]  the other day.
[53:26.080 --> 53:27.080]  We're not going to repeat any of that.
[53:27.080 --> 53:29.080]  We won't go there, but that's fucking golden.
[53:29.080 --> 53:30.080]  Shout out Sloppy.
[53:30.080 --> 53:31.080]  I hope you listen to this podcast.
[53:31.080 --> 53:32.080]  I heard what you said.
[53:32.080 --> 53:34.080]  You're amazing, my friend.
[53:34.080 --> 53:35.080]  That was.
[53:35.080 --> 53:37.080]  Sloppy, shout out for killing it out there on the mountain, bro.
[53:37.080 --> 53:39.080]  You said you were going to do something and motherfucker, you were doing it.
[53:39.080 --> 53:40.080]  Yeah.
[53:40.080 --> 53:41.080]  Man.
[53:41.080 --> 53:42.080]  Doing it.
[53:42.080 --> 53:43.080]  Proud of you, bro.
[53:43.080 --> 53:44.080]  Proud of you.
[53:44.080 --> 53:46.080]  He was a youngster when he moved here.
[53:46.080 --> 53:47.080]  You know what I'm saying?
[53:47.080 --> 53:49.080]  Like Sloppy was kind of just getting his feet wet when he moved here.
[53:49.080 --> 53:54.080]  I got to meet you and Sloppy right when he first moved here.
[53:54.080 --> 53:56.080]  The Fong days.
[53:56.080 --> 53:57.080]  Fong.
[53:57.080 --> 53:58.080]  Fong Nguyen.
[53:58.080 --> 53:59.080]  Bro, Fong, I hope you listen to the podcast.
[53:59.080 --> 54:01.080]  I have no idea, but either way, shout out to Fong Nguyen.
[54:01.080 --> 54:02.080]  Check him out.
[54:02.080 --> 54:03.080]  He's a good dude.
[54:03.080 --> 54:04.080]  He does some art.
[54:04.080 --> 54:05.080]  Great art.
[54:06.080 --> 54:07.080]  He made me a Chewbacca torch.
[54:07.080 --> 54:08.080]  That Chewbacca torch.
[54:08.080 --> 54:09.080]  Is that where that came from?
[54:09.080 --> 54:10.080]  That came from Fong Nguyen.
[54:10.080 --> 54:11.080]  Chewy Torch.
[54:11.080 --> 54:12.080]  That's his sculpture, his artwork right there.
[54:12.080 --> 54:14.080]  All right, guys, I think it's time to wrap up the podcast.
[54:14.080 --> 54:15.080]  Everybody here's dabbed the fuck out.
[54:15.080 --> 54:17.080]  We're going to take some more dabs for you.
[54:17.080 --> 54:20.080]  Somebody dab while I start talking and rambling so that we can hear people cough.
[54:20.080 --> 54:22.080]  Maybe give Mike a dab so he can cough on the show.
[54:22.080 --> 54:24.080]  We've all been scared of those turds.
[54:24.080 --> 54:26.080]  You haven't even had a Lemon G Rude Boy by chance.
[54:26.080 --> 54:29.080]  I do have some of the Lemon G Rude Boy that is in this pile.
[54:29.080 --> 54:31.080]  We just got to dig through these piles of hashes.
[54:31.080 --> 54:32.080]  Is this for somebody?
[54:32.080 --> 54:33.080]  Look at this right here, bro.
[54:33.080 --> 54:34.080]  Lemon G.
[54:34.080 --> 54:35.080]  I was going to snag a little piece of it.
[54:35.080 --> 54:37.080]  Lemon OG shatter.
[54:37.080 --> 54:40.080]  I just meant like the looks.
[54:40.080 --> 54:41.080]  Take a dab, bro.
[54:41.080 --> 54:42.080]  As big as you would like.
[54:42.080 --> 54:43.080]  Actually, I'm just going to gobble it all up.
[54:43.080 --> 54:45.080]  Make sure you guys follow all of my friends on social media.
[54:45.080 --> 54:51.080]  Mike is at Nemopunk15 on Twitter.
[54:51.080 --> 54:54.080]  At the Twitter, not the Tinder, just the Twitter.
[54:54.080 --> 54:55.080]  We're not going to do that again.
[54:55.080 --> 54:59.080]  I laughed so hard when I heard that.
[54:59.080 --> 55:01.080]  I was waiting for it.
[55:02.080 --> 55:04.080]  Make sure you follow Bobo Blaster Co. on Instagram.
[55:04.080 --> 55:05.080]  Yes, please.

[55:32.080 --> 55:34.080]  Facebook, Instagram, Twitter.
[55:34.080 --> 55:36.080]  I'm on Mass Roots, but I barely ever fuck with it.
[55:36.080 --> 55:37.080]  I'm on Green Door.
[55:37.080 --> 55:39.080]  I don't mess with that one very much.
[55:39.080 --> 55:41.080]  Green Door, I don't think I've heard of that.
[55:41.080 --> 55:42.080]  It's fun.
[55:42.080 --> 55:43.080]  Shout out to Emily Hyde.
[55:43.080 --> 55:44.080]  She's the one that runs, that does a lot of stuff with that.
[55:44.080 --> 55:45.080]  She's the one that introduced me to it.
[55:45.080 --> 55:47.080]  She gave me a bunch of tokens to get started.
[55:47.080 --> 55:49.080]  It's a token-based system.
[55:49.080 --> 55:52.080]  If you go for that one, trust me.
[55:52.080 --> 55:53.080]  Okay.
[55:53.080 --> 55:54.080]  Yeah, trust me.
[55:54.080 --> 55:55.080]  Go for that.
[55:55.080 --> 55:57.080]  I haven't tried the OG Kush yet.
[55:57.080 --> 55:58.080]  You want, do it.
[55:58.080 --> 56:01.080]  No, I'm asking, is it worth it or is the lemon?
[56:01.080 --> 56:02.080]  I love it.
[56:02.080 --> 56:03.080]  Because I got to try the lemon yesterday.
[56:03.080 --> 56:04.080]  Do it then.
[56:04.080 --> 56:06.080]  Go for the OG, but you would prefer the lemon G.
[56:06.080 --> 56:07.080]  No, I would.
[56:07.080 --> 56:08.080]  Okay, that's fine.
[56:08.080 --> 56:09.080]  Trust me.
[56:09.080 --> 56:10.080]  That's fine.
[56:10.080 --> 56:11.080]  I'll wait.
[56:11.080 --> 56:12.080]  That's why there's so much of which one left.
[56:12.080 --> 56:13.080]  I'm good.
[56:13.080 --> 56:14.080]  I got a freshie of the ghost train haze over here if we have to do that too.
[56:14.080 --> 56:15.080]  He pulled out the-
[56:15.080 --> 56:16.080]  It's not going to fit in there, bro.
[56:16.080 --> 56:17.080]  What are you trying to do?
[56:17.080 --> 56:18.080]  I know.
[56:18.080 --> 56:19.080]  I realize that.
[56:19.080 --> 56:20.080]  You're just trying to play Operation over here.
[56:20.080 --> 56:21.080]  Back to kindergarten.
[56:21.080 --> 56:22.080]  The block doesn't-
[56:22.080 --> 56:23.080]  You're going to hit the buzzer, dude.
[56:23.080 --> 56:24.080]  There you go.
[56:25.080 --> 56:26.080]  I'm going to be quick because it'll stick to the jar.
[56:26.080 --> 56:27.080]  Boba Blastico on the dunk.
[56:27.080 --> 56:28.080]  What else do we got?
[56:28.080 --> 56:29.080]  Social media.
[56:29.080 --> 56:30.080]  That's where we were.
[56:30.080 --> 56:31.080]  We were on social media.
[56:31.080 --> 56:32.080]  I think that's all I've got for you guys.
[56:32.080 --> 56:33.080]  Shout-out to my buddy, Fred Garvin.
[56:33.080 --> 56:34.080]  Fred Garvin, you send me a lot of useful tips and questions and stuff.
[56:34.080 --> 56:35.080]  You keep the show moving.
[56:35.080 --> 56:36.080]  Anybody else that you got emails, send them to me.
[56:36.080 --> 56:37.080]  I would love to hear from you.
[56:37.080 --> 56:38.080]  I think that's all I've got.
[56:38.080 --> 56:39.080]  These guys are rambling a whole bunch in here.
[56:39.080 --> 56:40.080]  We're going to end up-
[56:40.080 --> 56:41.080]  It's about to get real turpy.
[56:41.080 --> 56:42.080]  It's about to get turpy.
[56:42.080 --> 56:43.080]  We're all going to take some lemon G-Turps.
[56:43.080 --> 56:44.080]  Somebody else is going to join us at the table real quick.
[56:44.080 --> 56:45.080]  I assume we're about to take the leap toward the table.
[56:45.080 --> 56:46.080]  Shout-out to everybody that listened to the podcast.
[56:46.080 --> 56:47.080]  Shout-out to everybody that supports the podcast.
[56:47.080 --> 56:48.080]  Shout-out to everybody that supports the legalization of cannabis nation motherfucking wide.
[56:48.080 --> 56:49.080]  I love you guys all like you're my own adopted children.
[56:49.080 --> 56:50.080]  Shout-out to my ninja Spence.
[56:50.080 --> 56:51.080]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[56:51.080 --> 56:52.080]  Transcribed by https://otter.ai
[57:14.080 --> 57:51.980]  Tell her try your best just tell her it's a case of emergency
[57:51.980 --> 58:12.570]  Gregory is
[58:12.570 --> 58:26.880]  All the pain is getting worse
[58:26.880 --> 58:31.880]  I don't wanna see no doc
[58:31.880 --> 58:39.880]  I need attendance from my nurse around the clock
[58:39.880 --> 58:44.880]  Cause there's no prescription for me
[58:44.880 --> 58:52.880]  She's the one, the only remedy
[58:52.880 --> 58:58.880]  Night nurse
[58:58.880 --> 59:05.850]  Only you alone can quench this thirst
[59:05.850 --> 59:11.850]  My night nurse
[59:11.850 --> 59:16.850]  All the pain is getting worse
[59:16.850 --> 59:23.850]  I'm hurt by love
[59:24.850 --> 59:29.850]  Oh
[59:31.850 --> 59:36.850]  I don't wanna see no doc
[59:36.850 --> 59:44.850]  I need attendance from my nurse around the clock
[59:44.850 --> 59:49.850]  Cause there's no prescription for me
[59:49.850 --> 59:56.850]  She's the one, the only remedy
[59:56.850 --> 01:00:02.850]  Night nurse
[01:00:02.850 --> 01:00:09.850]  Only you alone can quench this thirst
[01:00:09.850 --> 01:00:15.850]  My night nurse
[01:00:15.850 --> 01:00:20.850]  All the pain is getting worse
[01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:25.850]  I'm hurt by love
[01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:30.850]  And I'm sure
[01:00:30.850 --> 01:00:36.850]  No doctor can cure
[01:00:36.850 --> 01:00:52.850]  My night nurse
[01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:59.850]  Night nurse
[01:00:59.850 --> 01:01:02.850]  Oh gosh
[01:01:03.850 --> 01:01:25.720]  Yeah, welcome back Cannabis Community
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:28.720]  It's time for episode number 145 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:32.720]  Your source for cannabis news, education and conversation
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:34.720]  That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:36.720]  If you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:40.720]  If you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:43.720]  This my friends is the podcast for you
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:45.720]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:47.720]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:50.720]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shoutout to my friends in the Mystic Roots Band
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.720]  For letting me use their music on my podcast
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:56.720]  Big shoutout to Kat, Coot and the entire Mystic Roots crew
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:59.720]  I hope everybody's having a great week
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:01.720]  You guys, this episode is packed with information
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:05.720]  I'm gonna do an episode about an email I got about making feminized seeds
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:09.720]  And selecting phenotypes for seeds and seed breeding and feminized seed making
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:12.720]  This one was right up my alley so I took a lot of notes
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:15.720]  This will be a great episode in my opinion, I'm excited to do it
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:18.720]  But before we get that far, let's talk about the secret sesh
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:20.720]  The secret sesh was just a few days ago
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:24.720]  And in my opinion, this was the best secret sesh we've done in Colorado
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:27.720]  The secret sesh on 421, the day after 420
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:29.720]  That was pretty fucking fantastic
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:31.720]  But that was the day after 420
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:34.720]  There were a lot of really cool people in town that wouldn't normally be here
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:36.720]  We had a lot of extra hype because of 420 weekend
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:38.720]  A lot of extra momentum, that really helped us out
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:41.720]  It was a little over hyped and too big for me
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:44.720]  I like a smaller, more intimate event
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.720]  So without all the hustle and bustle
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:48.720]  This was my favorite secret sesh I think
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:50.720]  There were plenty of people there, the place was packed
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:53.720]  But it was a little more intimate, there was more room to dab, more room to chill out
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:56.720]  It was a little quieter, you could go get some quiet space
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:59.720]  And talk to some people if you wanted to, I really enjoyed that
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:03.720]  So huge shout out to the Grimy Gatsby for throwing a stellar event
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:05.720]  Big shout out to Miles for putting it together
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:09.720]  Big shout out to Hunt, big shout out to everybody who participated in the secret sesh
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:11.720]  I'm gonna go down a little bit of a list here
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:13.720]  The Terps from EVO Labs
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:15.720]  Big shout out to my buddy Brett
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:18.720]  Brett, ah, Mary's motivation on Instagram, make sure you follow him
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:21.720]  That dude showed up with a pocket full of Terps
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:25.720]  Somebody said something, my buddy Bobo said something to Brett
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.720]  And Brett goes, so you want some Terps?
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:29.720]  And of course Bobo was like, well of course I want some Terps
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:33.720]  And he threw him a canister filled with little Terp containers
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:35.720]  And Bobo's eyes lit up like a child at Christmas
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:38.720]  And I just happened to have a bunch of packs of seeds in my pocket
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:40.720]  That I was gonna give to some friends to grow out
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:43.720]  And since I saw that beautiful gift given right there
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:46.720]  I decided to return some karma and I passed some seeds Brett's way
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:48.720]  So Brett's got some iReed genetic seeds in his garden
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:51.720]  He'll be growing those out before too long and we'll talk about those on the podcast
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:53.720]  So big huge shout out to the Terpy boy Brett
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:55.720]  Brett hooks it up with the Terps
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:57.720]  He's just got us dabbed out
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:58.720]  He had some super good flavors
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:00.720]  Everybody at the event had good flavors
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:02.720]  Shout out to our friends at the Terp Suite
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:04.720]  All those kids always bring the flame
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:06.720]  It was good to see Diamond Dave at the event
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.720]  Dave, I don't know if you listen to the podcast, big shout out
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:10.720]  Shake your hand and see you, haven't seen you in a long time
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:14.720]  Just seemed like we weren't getting along on Facebook for some reason
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:17.720]  Bro, and it's good to shake your hand and fucking put that behind us
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:19.720]  So welcome back to the crew my friend
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:22.720]  Big shout out to Lindsey and Chris for letting me kinda tag along
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:24.720]  To be their third wheel, I had fun hanging out with you guys
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:26.720]  We'll get Lindsey on another episode
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:28.720]  Because I've got something I want to talk to her about
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:31.720]  And then we'll talk about sending stickers to all you people that we owe stickers to
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:34.720]  We did not forget, Mike and Lindsey and I talked about it via text message
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:36.720]  I know we owe you guys some stickers
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.720]  I know you got stickers coming, a couple other people, you got stickers coming
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:40.720]  The people that participated in the mullet challenge
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:42.720]  You do have stickers coming, I did not forget about you
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:44.720]  The people that hit up hashtag I like it when you ramble
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.720]  You've got stickers coming, nobody forgot about you
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:48.720]  We're just dabbed, we're blazing confused
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:50.720]  We're doing what we can to keep up
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.720]  So back on track here, shout out to Adam Mill
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:54.720]  Adam Mill comes all the way from California
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:56.720]  He flies in from Burbank all the way to Colorado here
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:58.720]  To host the Secret Session with us
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:00.720]  So big shout out to my boy Adam Mill
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:02.720]  Whaaaaat?
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:04.720]  If you don't know about Adam Mill, make sure you follow him
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:06.720]  He's Adam Bluntz, I think
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:08.720]  He always has to change his social media, they always shut down his social media
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:10.720]  He has to restart new shit
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:12.720]  Search Adam Mill on Instagram, I think it's Adam Bluntz on Facebook
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:14.720]  Check him out
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:16.720]  He's the hostess with the mostess
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:18.720]  Also big shout out to my buddy Giddy Up
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:20.720]  I haven't seen Giddy Up in a while
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:22.720]  Giddy Up was at the Secret Session, rocking a mohawk, building a stage
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:24.720]  Great dude, that Giddy Up guy
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:26.720]  Make sure you guys support Emotech
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:28.720]  That dude just moved to Hollywood, California
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:30.720]  He's young and rich and lives in Cali now
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:32.720]  Good luck with that one bro
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.720]  Big huge shout out to my buddy Jason Margulies
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:36.720]  It was good seeing you there
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.720]  Sorry I missed your lovely lady, it would have been good to see her
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:40.720]  Give her a high five and a half hug
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.720]  You know, one of those one arm hugs
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:44.720]  It's what we do, it would have been good to see her
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:46.720]  But it was good seeing you bro
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:48.720]  Next time bring the lady with you, we'll all hang out and take some turpy dabs
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:50.720]  I think that's all the shout outs I've got for the Secret Session
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:52.720]  You guys, I turned down edibles this time
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:54.720]  I did not eat any edibles at the Secret Session
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:56.720]  Shout out to TNT Extracts, he gave me some 200 mg bacon
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:58.720]  Yeah, he handed me bacon
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:00.720]  Wrapped in parchment paper
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:02.720]  And I was like, hmm, okay then
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:04.720]  And I walked away and acted like I was going to eat it
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.720]  But of course I gave that to our buddy Bobo
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:08.720]  Shout out to Bobo Blastrico
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:10.720]  All the edibles I was given that night, I passed them right over to Bobo
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:12.720]  At the Sesh, people will just walk by you and hand you edibles
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:14.720]  They're like, here you need some edibles bro
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.720]  And I will take them
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:18.720]  But then if I'm not in the edibles zone that night, I just pass them on to friends
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:20.720]  Bobo got all of my excess edibles
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:22.720]  He was lit up, that was pretty fun
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:24.720]  But I'm afraid, you guys
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:26.720]  I ate a bunch of edibles at the last Secret Sesh
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:28.720]  I ate, I don't even know
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:30.720]  A lot of edibles, I had a lot of THC in my body
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.720]  I'm going to guess somewhere between 800 and 1500 mg of THC in my body
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:34.720]  I was challenged
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:36.720]  I was having a rough time
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:38.720]  And then our friends at TNT Extracts
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.720]  Gave me a 1000 mg edible
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:42.720]  And I ate it for breakfast the next day on my way to work
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:44.720]  And by the time I got to work
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:46.720]  It felt like I had wrapped a vice around my brain
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:48.720]  And I was trying to function on half speed all day
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:50.720]  So I've been afraid of edibles since then to tell you the truth
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:52.720]  And I haven't eaten any
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:54.720]  It's been quite a while
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:56.720]  I don't know if I'll do it forever
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.720]  Probably go see fish and eat a couple hundred mg at the fish show
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:00.720]  That might be what has to happen
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:02.720]  Alright you guys, let's get to the point
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:04.720]  Let's get to the point
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:06.720]  The point of this podcast
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:08.720]  I received an email from a friend
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:10.720]  Let me open up this email
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:12.720]  I've got it saved right here on the phone
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:14.720]  This dude signed his name as
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:16.720]  Just a noob trying to learn
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:18.720]  And then he called himself Ben
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:20.720]  So noob trying to learn, this question was great
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:22.720]  You asked a lot of great shit
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:24.720]  And you really sparked a great podcast in my opinion
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:26.720]  So I'm going to read the email
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:28.720]  The email goes like this
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:30.720]  Greetings Jeff, first off I want to say thank you for the kickass podcast
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:32.720]  And that you have taught me so much in these weekly sessions
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:34.720]  They make my Monday morning commute tolerable
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:36.720]  Dude that's why I put them out Monday morning
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.720]  So your week doesn't have to start with a shitty Monday
[01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:40.720]  You start off with some kickass podcast material
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.720]  I'm glad you noticed
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:44.720]  Thanks for checking it out
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:46.720]  So he goes on to say
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:48.720]  While I have yet to grow a bud because of where I live
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:50.720]  The topic nonetheless consumes much of my thoughts
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:52.720]  And I try to learn everything I can
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:54.720]  Much of the gained knowledge has led to practices
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:56.720]  That have benefited my outdoor vegetable garden
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:58.720]  Even still I have what may seem to be
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:00.720]  A stupid question
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:02.720]  Dude your question is not stupid
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:04.720]  I was so excited when I read this
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:06.720]  I was like ooh I know a lot about this
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:08.720]  And I'm going to get to ramble on for a long time
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:10.720]  So I'm going to continue with the email
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:12.720]  It says it seems that many strains are named for a special phenotypically expressed trait
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:14.720]  That manifests in a particular smell, flavor, or color
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:16.720]  Now if you're lucky enough to find one of those desirable phenotypes
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:18.720]  The strain is known for when popping seeds
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.720]  It seems that you can get a lot of benefits
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:22.720]  But when popping seeds
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:24.720]  It seems that you can enjoy that treat continually
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:26.720]  If you had the foresight to take clones
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:28.720]  Absolutely correct
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:30.720]  That's why I encourage everybody
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:32.720]  Every time you grow a seed
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:34.720]  Every time it gets big enough to take a clone
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:36.720]  You take a clone off of it before you flower it
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:38.720]  Because you don't know if that seed is going to bear
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:40.720]  The most amazing cannabis you have ever smoked in your life
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:42.720]  And if you don't have a clone of it
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:44.720]  You might try to kick yourself in the ass
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:46.720]  And you're going to be kind of mad about it
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:48.720]  It's heartbreaking
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:50.720]  Don't get a cut of this super amazing herb
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:52.720]  I grew some
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:54.720]  Excuse me for the throat clearing
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:56.720]  Of course that's a bunch of dabs
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:58.720]  Sorry about that
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:00.720]  I grew some Holy Grail Kush from DNA Genetics
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.720]  And it was honestly
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:04.720]  Superb cannabis
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:06.720]  If you can get your hands on some Holy Grail Kush seeds
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:08.720]  I recommend that from another breeder
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:10.720]  That's not even my brand
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:12.720]  Get that from DNA Genetics
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.720]  It may be a Reserva Pravada project by now
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:16.720]  But Holy Grail Kush
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:18.720]  From DNA Genetics
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:20.720]  It's amazing cannabis
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:22.720]  The phenotype I selected would not make clones
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:24.720]  They would not root for shit
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:26.720]  I put them in rockwool
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:28.720]  They dribbled up
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:30.720]  I put them in a cloner
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:32.720]  They got funky and fell apart
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:34.720]  I could not get that shit to clone
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:36.720]  I'll never get to taste that flavor again
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:38.720]  My friend Pops is an old guy
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:40.720]  He says that was one of the top five best pots he's ever smoked
[01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:42.720]  And Pops is an old dude and hard to impress
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:44.720]  So the Holy Grail Kush was some special shit
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:46.720]  I wish I had a clone of that
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:48.720]  It is gone
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:50.720]  One of my favorite strains ever was the P91
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:52.720]  And there were some serious raids of large grow facilities
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:54.720]  And the P91
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:56.720]  Rumor has it was lost in that raid
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:58.720]  Somebody claims to have it
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:00.720]  But I really don't know if that is what they have got
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:02.720]  Anybody can claim to have it
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:04.720]  So let's talk about something else you said in here
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:06.720]  It seems that the strains are named for a special phenotypically expressed trait
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:08.720]  Yes, that's why the sour diesel is called sour diesel
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:10.720]  Because it smells like diesel fuel
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:12.720]  I think they tried to name the Girl Scout cookies that
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:14.720]  Because they wanted us to think that it tastes like Girl Scout cookies
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:16.720]  It's a little bit
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:18.720]  They called it the thin mint cut
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:20.720]  If you get the thin mint
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:22.720]  And you taste the thin mint cookies and the thin mint cut
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:24.720]  It could be close
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.720]  So that part is totally accurate
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:28.720]  Now here's what I really
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:30.720]  What I really like to get into in this part of the email
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:32.720]  It says
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:34.720]  If the traits are passed from mother to clone
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:36.720]  Would it be likely that the same traits would be present
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:38.720]  In nearly 100% of the seeds
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:40.720]  If you were to make feminized seeds
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:42.720]  From this plant
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:46.720]  You would hope so
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:48.720]  Because of logic but that is not accurate
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:50.720]  And I took a bunch of notes and I'll get into that
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:52.720]  I'm going to have to take a break here in a second
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:54.720]  Take a drink but let me keep reading the email and then I'll take a drink
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:56.720]  Take a quick break just because you guys don't want to hear me clear my throat
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:58.720]  A thousand more times
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:00.720]  The email goes on to say my logic may be way off
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:02.720]  On this as I am not a botanist or geneticist
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:04.720]  But if it does play out like this
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:06.720]  Then why don't the seed companies
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:08.720]  Grow out several plants to find that rare phenotype
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:10.720]  And then make feminized seeds from that plant
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.720]  Any knowledge you can drop
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:14.720]  Will be greatly appreciated
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:16.720]  Thanks bro
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:18.720]  From just a noob trying to learn
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:20.720]  Then he signs it Ben
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:22.720]  Noob this is a great question I'm going to press pause for just a second here
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:24.720]  Take a drink and then I'll be right back
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:26.720]  Alright you guys I'm back
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:28.720]  I took a big fresh drink I feel like I'm better
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:30.720]  I'll be better for a minute I'm going to take a dab and fuck it all up again
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:32.720]  But I'm better for now
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:34.720]  Alright let's get back to this email
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:36.720]  The part that got my attention here at the end said
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:38.720]  Would it be likely that the same traits would be present in nearly 100% of the seeds
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:40.720]  Now a clone you're taking a cutting from an existing plant
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:42.720]  And that plant is making a root of course right
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:44.720]  And then you're getting a clone
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:46.720]  So all the traits are passed because there is no opportunity for any other chromosomes or genetics
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:48.720]  Or traits to be introduced into that cut
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:50.720]  There's nothing you're not going to pull DNA out of the air to change the traits
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:52.720]  So yes that one will be exactly like the mother that it came from
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:54.720]  But it's not going to be the same
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:56.720]  So I'm going to go ahead and click on that
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:58.720]  And I'm going to click on the seed
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:00.720]  And I'm going to click on the seed
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:02.720]  And I'm going to click on the seed
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:04.720]  And I'm going to click on the seed
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:05.600]  A node the one that I'm looking for
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:07.600]  is what looks like the mother that he came from
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:09.600]  And when we're working with seeds
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:11.600]  we have the opportunity for variation
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:13.600]  Because we are using pollen that has
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:15.600]  Chromosomes from the grandparents
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:17.600]  You're not only getting parents
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:19.600]  Not only getting chromosomes from that selected phenotype
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:21.600]  But you're getting
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:23.600]  Chromosomes from whatever that plant is a cross of
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.600]  So let me back up a little bit
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:27.600]  Something that I want to mention
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.600]  We do search for those selected phenotypes that you mentioned
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:31.400]  Right now I'm making
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:33.400]  a rise F2s
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:40.120]  which means I made an Arise strain, which I took Daybreaker as the male and I put Daybreaker
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:45.800]  pollen on a golden goat female and I took those seeds and what came out of that, I named
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:51.080]  that Arise. So I've found a beautiful male. I've got a studly male. He produces the structure
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:57.200]  I want, the aroma I want. He makes resin. This male plant is a stud. So I've got that.
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:01.400]  And then I've got, I think right now I've got three or four gorgeous Arise females that
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:06.320]  I need to pick one of those because I want to take that Arise male and I want to put
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:11.480]  that pollen on that Arise female and make Arise F2s. And I'm doing that by selecting
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:15.600]  the perfect phenotype of the perfect male and the perfect female to bring out the traits
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:19.140]  that I'm looking for. Now I could screw that all up. I could bring out a bunch of recessive
[01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:22.000]  traits and it could be a total disaster and I'll have to go back and find a different
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.560]  male and female and do it all over again. But that's why I grew out a bunch of them
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:30.600]  myself before I try to sell them or give them away to anybody. I make sure to grow probably
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:35.280]  a hundred of those by myself before anybody else will even see them. So we do look for
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:40.740]  those phenotypes. We find those perfect phenotypes. And sometimes a cross will be made that wasn't
[01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:43.840]  intended to smell like something. I don't think that Tangie, I don't think that the
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:47.200]  guy that made Tangie, I think that was Crockett. I don't think Crockett was like, I want to
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:53.120]  make Tangie. I think Tangie should be Calio and this, whatever the hell he used, I forgot.
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:57.260]  But this orange plant, I don't think he was like, I want to make Tangie. I think he crossed
[01:13:57.260 --> 01:14:00.280]  some shit and it came out and tastes like tangerines. And he's like, that's it, Tangie.
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:03.280]  I think that's how that came. I don't think Sour Diesel. I don't think anybody was like,
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:07.280]  I want to make a strain that tastes like diesel fuel. I think it was actually named because
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:11.320]  of that. So they selected that one. Now let's talk about something else you said. Why don't
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:17.880]  we use those selected phenotypes? We do. And then if I'm going to make feminized seeds
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:22.520]  from that selected phenotype, I'm going to treat... So I'm going to take two clones of
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:26.160]  the same plant, the selected phenotype that has the traits that we like, the one that...
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:30.920]  So we'll say Grateful Dog. I've made feminized seeds of Grateful Dog. I've grown a bunch
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:35.040]  of my own Grateful Dog seeds. I found the one that is stellar. So I take two clones
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:40.280]  of that, I reverse one and I put that reversed pollen onto the female Grateful Dog. And now
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:48.240]  I make Grateful Dog seeds. Now sometimes those Grateful Dog seeds look like Chemdog. And
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:52.760]  sometimes those Grateful Dog seeds look a little bit more like San Fernando Valley OG
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:56.720]  or a little bit more like a Bush. But a lot of them look very much like the Grateful Dog
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:01.740]  clone that I reversed and started with. And then we'll get a little bit of variation that's
[01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:05.560]  a little closer to the chem, but more OG, and then a little more OG, but closer to the
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:09.580]  chem. And then you'll see blends of the traits. It's kind of like making kids. Your sister
[01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:12.120]  might look a little different from you, but you could definitely tell you're from the
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:15.760]  same gene pool. It's just going to vary a little bit more from... So you're going to
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:18.760]  see traits of grandma is what I'm saying. You're going to see traits of grandpa is what
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:23.520]  I'm saying. And sometimes you might see great grandparent traits. So let me refer back to
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:27.400]  my notes here to keep myself on topic because I'm getting way, way off of what I'm trying
[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:31.960]  to say. So we do search for those phenotypes. So that's how we make our F2s. And then we
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:39.840]  do reverse those to make our Feminized seeds. I breed with my second and third generations
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:44.000]  from those select... I make my second and third generations from those selected plants.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.080]  And I was talking about picking one female and one female, or one male and one female.
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:53.520]  And something else I also do, I will take multiple females of the same strain and one
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:58.920]  male of that strain and hit three or four different females with that male pollen. And
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:04.680]  that way I can see the variation. I can see that this girl produces more resinous offspring.
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:08.160]  I can see that this girl produces tall and lanky offspring. So I don't want to breed
[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:10.760]  to that one again. Let's go ahead and get rid of that. I can see that this one over
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:15.240]  here produces really lanky plants that stink really well, but don't make a lot of resin.
[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:19.200]  So maybe I don't want to breed to that one. So I'll go and hit multiple females. So that
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:25.920]  way I can find the best breeding plants that I can use. So I'll also hit different females
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:30.480]  of different strains in that room with that male. So I'll put four females. So when I
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:35.000]  do this Arise F2, it's about to happen pretty soon. I'll probably put two, maybe three females
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.840]  of Arise in there to be honest. And then I'm going to probably put seven or eight, maybe
[01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:42.360]  nine or 10 females of other strains in there. There'll be a Grateful Dog in there. I'm going
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:46.000]  to put a Golden Goat in there to take it backwards a little bit. I've got some other
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.680]  stuff that's going to go in there. I've got some crosses I made that'll go in there. Then
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:54.320]  I'm going to hit all of those with pollen and then we'll see what comes of all of that
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:57.560]  progeny. There'll be a whole bunch of great stuff. All right, let's get myself back on
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:02.440]  track. He said, my logic may be way off on this, but I am not a botanist or geneticist,
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:05.720]  which I like. He said, but if it does play out like this, then why don't the seed companies
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:10.640]  grow out several plants to find the rare phenotypes and then make feminize seeds from that plant?
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:15.520]  Well, that's kind of exactly what they slash we do, my friend. I hope I explained that
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:18.720]  in a way that makes a lot of sense to you. One thing I want to go back over is the word
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:26.920]  phenotype. I hear a lot of people say phenome. It's a phenotype, phenotypical expression,
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:32.920]  pheno, not phenome, just to make you sound cooler in your circle. So when you're making
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:36.360]  seeds and those seeds do come out, of course, variation is natural. That's something that
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:40.920]  we expect. We can't control it completely. If you want to make something that I did that
[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:45.280]  I didn't even realize I was doing something out of the norm, I made feminized seeds. Then
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:52.240]  I found my favorite phenotype out of that batch of feminized seeds. Then I hit that
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:57.400]  feminized plant with the original pollen that I made feminized seeds from. The progeny from
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:02.440]  that was super stable. I did it again. Then I tried to reverse one of those plants and
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:06.720]  I could not get it to reverse. I could not make the plant herm. I could not change the
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:12.040]  sex of that plant to make more feminized seeds with that generation of that progeny. I was
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:16.080]  super impressed with the stability of that plant. That plant is still around. It's been
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:21.920]  named GD77. A lot of people ask me about my naming schemes. They're very random. Grateful
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:29.000]  Dog was GD. 1977 is one of my favorite years of the Grateful Dead. So GD77, it's the Grateful
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:34.640]  Dead 77 Pheno. I love it. It's in the mother room right now. That's one of my favorite
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:38.640]  keepers. I've probably had that one for, I don't even know how long. I really can't remember.
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:42.520]  I've had it for a super long time. Long time, eight years. I'll say eight years I've had
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:46.360]  that clone. All right, let's get back on track here. I like the variation. That's what I'm
[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:49.800]  saying. Variation is cool. When you're making seeds, I like variation. I don't want every
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:54.040]  seed to grow out just like the picture on the package because everyone's got that one.
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:57.040]  I want a little bit of variation. That means that the grower down the street that bought
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:01.520]  those seeds doesn't have the phenotype that I've got. That means that there might be something
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:05.280]  better in there. That means you can always keep growing more seeds. That's why I love
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:09.200]  seeds. You might find something better than what you've already got. Sometimes when somebody
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:12.560]  loses a plant or if something doesn't root when you try to clone it, I always look at
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:16.560]  the bright side. That means I get to grow more seeds because seeds are the way to go.
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:20.280]  Seeds have vigor. You can find new shit in there. Every strain that you're smoking, every
[01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:25.400]  clone that you've ever grown, that came from a seed. Right, it had to.
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:31.000]  Variation, of course, you could stabilize that just by breeding. Make F2s, make F3s.
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.920]  By the time you get to F5, those seeds will be super stable. You'll start making seeds
[01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:41.000]  that produce almost clones. Once you get to the F6 generation, probably 90% of the seeds
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.280]  that you plant are going to look just like the picture on the package if the breeder
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:47.120]  did it properly. All right, you guys, I'm going to take a dab in a drink and I'm going
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:50.080]  to get another email to you. Before I do that, I want to give a big shout out to our buddy,
[01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:53.560]  The Noob, that sent us this email. I really appreciate it. I like talking about feminized
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:56.280]  seeds. I like talking about making seeds. I like talking about breeding. That's some
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:20:01.800]  of my favorite shit. If you have more questions about that, send them to me, growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:06.440]  I will read your emails on a future episode. Guys, I need a drink and a dab. Bear with
[01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:08.920]  me. Play some reggae music and you can hang out for a second.
[01:20:48.440 --> 01:21:11.600]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I am back. I took a drink. I did not take some dabs this
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:15.280]  time. I think I have a voice. I think my throat is going to hold up for at least a couple
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:20.360]  more emails. All right, let's get to another email. This one says Rasta J. Recently discovered
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:24.600]  my latest batch of girls are not as innocent as I would like. Yes, they are flat ass full
[01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:29.920]  of seeds. My question for you is if there are any dead giveaways to determine if they
[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:35.120]  were pollinated or simply hermed. I did have a sneaky male get by me until about week three.
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:39.320]  I had him labeled wrong and stuck him in the flower room. I'm hoping this is the case and
[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:44.640]  not a herm issue. Then he continues to give me reasons why his plants may have hermed
[01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:49.720]  and duty at a male. He fucked up. You got a boy in there. That male at three weeks.
[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:53.960]  He busted a nut. He pollinated your girls. Do you know what that male was? That's my
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:57.000]  question. Now, if you know what that male plant was, you may have accidentally just
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.680]  bred some shit. Keep those seeds. Grow them out. See what you got. Yeah, I'm pretty sure
[01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:04.840]  that that male dropped pollen. It only takes about 14 days for some of those studlier males
[01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:08.400]  to just start blowing pollen everywhere. So if you had him in there until about week
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:13.160]  three, I'm pretty sure that's who hit those girls with pollen from the list of things
[01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:18.440]  you mentioned that may be reasons why those plants hermed. It does not look likely to
[01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:23.600]  me. The recent switch of lighting that would not do it. The slight foxtailing you mentioned,
[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:27.560]  that's because they got too hot. I don't think that made them herm. So you had a dude in
[01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:33.000]  there. You guys, when you have male, if you're growing from seed or if you have a male plant,
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.760]  I have males in my stable. I got a couple of big fat male arise plants in there. I got
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:40.360]  Solomon just chilling. He's kicking it. It's like three feet tall. But if you're going
[01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:44.160]  from seed and you got boy plants, those boy plants will drop pollen. I've actually got
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:48.600]  a strawberry tangy banana male plant in a very small pot. It's getting root bound and
[01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:53.260]  I can see male flower clusters forming on the top. If I don't get that out of there
[01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:57.200]  in the next 10 days, he will drop pollen. That pollen will come from there. So if you're
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:23:00.600]  growing from seed, keep an eye on those pollen sacks. And if you don't want seeded plants,
[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:04.640]  if you don't want pollen, don't be lazy. Get those males out of there. This dude's
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:08.280]  a perfect example of why you don't want to have males in your garden. He's got seeds
[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:11.560]  now. That brings me to something I've wanted to say for a little while and haven't had
[01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:15.560]  the opportunity. You're running a garden and there's some shit that needs to be done. Do
[01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:19.920]  it today. Don't do it tomorrow. Why? Why wait? That's your garden. That's your love. That's
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:23.200]  your medicine. That's your product. If you're growing for commercial, if you're growing
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:27.360]  for medicinal, if you're growing just for love, do that shit today. Those plants are
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:30.800]  alive. You wouldn't, if your dog was hungry and your dog needed water, you wouldn't make
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:33.880]  the dog wait till tomorrow. Why do you make the plants wait? Love those plants. They're
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:37.760]  yours. You got to care for them. Respect the plants. Anything that needs to be done in
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:42.240]  the grove. If that bulb is dirty or if that bulb is dead, that lens is dirty. If that
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:46.120]  ducting is funky, don't do that shit tomorrow. Do that shit today. Don't be a lazy bitch.
[01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:49.800]  Get in there and clean your garden. Take care of that shit. Do it today. Love your plants.
[01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:55.080]  That garden, that crop is only going to be in flower for 63 days, 56, 63, maybe 70 days.
[01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:58.720]  If you're going hard, why not make every day count? Get in there and do that shit right.
[01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:02.040]  Do it today. Put some love into those plants. All right, I'll quit bitching at you. I'm
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:05.040]  sorry. I feel like I kind of got on you. Just love your plants, you guys. Get in there.
[01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:07.840]  Take care of that shit. You claim to love your garden, go love it.
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:11.880]  All right, I've got another message I want to read. Remember a few episodes ago, we had
[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:17.520]  a listener send an email asking about recommendations for dispensaries in Denver. I took a screenshot
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:22.480]  of his latest message. He sent me this message on Instagram. It says, Rasta Jeff, wanted
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:27.160]  to thank you for reading my email on your podcast and for recommending Natty Rems. My
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:31.160]  wife and I loved our trip. I wanted to let you know that Stitcher has all of your episodes
[01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:35.400]  starting at episode 40 all the way to the current episode. Keep those beautiful Instagram
[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:40.680]  images coming from our friend Fats. That's a great message to read. There's so much good
[01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:45.720]  shit in there. Man, I'm glad you enjoyed Natty Rems. I'm glad Colorado was super kind to
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:50.120]  you. I'm glad that you and your wife had a great trip. I'm also glad to hear that all
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:54.080]  of the episodes starting at episode 40 are on Stitcher. That's awesome. That means that
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:25:00.520]  everybody can listen all the way back to episode 40. It's probably 44-ish by now. It's 45 by
[01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:04.040]  the time this comes out. That means they're going to keep 100 episodes on there. That's
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:08.000]  cool. Awesome. There are 100 episodes of this podcast available on Stitcher, you guys. If
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.160]  you want to go listen to 100 episodes of the show, I encourage you to go back and listen
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:18.600]  to old episodes. One of my favorites, I think, is the scheduling your perpetual grow episode.
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:22.000]  That episode, that should have been a million-dollar book idea. Make sure you listen to that one
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.760]  for me. If you haven't heard that one, go listen to it. That's a great episode. I think
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:29.560]  it's number 72. I'm going to be a responsible podcast host and press pause and go make sure
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:32.520]  what number that is. All right. I found the information I wanted
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:36.560]  to find, but I want to let you guys know something funny that I just did. My buddy, John Hunt,
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:42.400]  gave me a pencil dabber. It is made out of green stardust glass. It's got some colored
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:47.360]  tips and a colored eraser end, or a colored tip where the pencil end would be, the colored
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:50.880]  tip where the eraser end would be. It's made out of glass. It's meant to be used as a dabber.
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:55.120]  My high ass just picked it up and tried to write a fucking note on my notepad with the
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:26:00.080]  dabber pencil. Shout out to Cannabis and THC for that shit.
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:03.800]  You guys, the episode I was actually referring to is number 73. Make sure you check out episode
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:07.840]  number 73. It's scheduling a perpetual grow. I feel like that episode should have been
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:11.400]  a million-dollar episode. While we're going through it, check out number 76 about female
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:16.880]  hunting. Then if you want to learn about outdoor, our friend Jesse comes by, episode number
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:22.320]  79. Definitely go back and check out 73. Number 55 is one of my favorite episodes.
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:26.720]  If you're new to the podcast, make sure you check out 55. I've thought about going back
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:31.320]  and releasing some of the older episodes on a Thursday, like a midweek episode. Maybe
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:34.920]  once some of those older episodes fall out of the feed, once I put so many episodes in
[01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:40.120]  that there's 50 more that I can repost, I'll go back and put those up on a Thursday or
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:42.920]  something so that they're still in the feed and you guys can listen to them. There are
[01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:45.720]  some great episodes that need to stay up for a little longer.
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:50.680]  Let's get this show back on track, you guys. Big shout out to our friend, Fats. I do appreciate
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:54.200]  the interaction. Dude, next time you're in Colorado, give me a heads up. We'll get together.
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:57.840]  We'll smoke some turps. We'll take some selfies. We'll have a good old time. You guys, if you
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:01.640]  want to send me a message or an email, or if you want to hit me up somehow, email me,
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:05.080]  growfromyourheartathotmail.com. I'll read your message. On a future episode, I will
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:09.640]  answer your questions. If you want to follow me on Instagram, it's at irie underscore genetics.

[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:18.360]  I would appreciate it. In an upcoming episode, my buddy Sammy sent me an email asking about
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:22.680]  easy cloners. I'm going to talk about that a little bit. I will also talk about how to
[01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:28.080]  set your email to the appropriate temp for your liking. Somebody sent me a question about
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:33.040]  my dream grow. I'm going to talk about that on an upcoming episode. Then I also have an
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:37.840]  episode of another question from a listener. I've got an episode about identifying issues
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:41.920]  in your garden. Then in a future episode, I will talk about how to treat and prevent
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:46.960]  most of those issues and or problems. If you guys have some content that you would
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:50.120]  like me to talk about, I encourage you to send me an email. Most of the episodes lately
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:55.160]  have come from listener questions. This podcast, this comes from my heart, but this podcast
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:59.240]  is for you. This isn't for me. This is for you. I love doing it. If you give me some
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:03.960]  content, I would love to read your stuff on the air. Get you guys going, get you growing,
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:07.120]  help you guys out. If you got something that you'd like to say and you're not in all that
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:10.400]  social media stuff, all you got to do is email me, growfromyourheartathotmail.com. You can
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:13.960]  remain anonymous and won't see your name on the air. I'll keep you safe. I don't know
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:18.160]  what state you're in, so I don't want to get you in any trouble. You guys make sure you
[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:21.560]  check out the podcast on iTunes and Stitcher. Don't forget that most of the episodes are
[01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:28.880]  available on iRegeneticsColorado.com. I think that is all I have got for you this week.
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:31.840]  That's all I got for you guys. I want to give a big shout out to my ninja Spence. Also a
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:35.880]  big shout out to Rasta Seb. Make sure you check me out in seven days. Until next time,
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:38.160]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:31:08.530]  Do it for the Terps.
[01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:29.200]  Welcome back, Cannabis Community. It's time for episode number 146 of the Grow From Your
[01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:34.200]  Heart podcast. Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right.

[01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:42.200]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current

[01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:08.200]  also proud of Lindsay. She's sitting across the table from me and she just mouthed the
[01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:13.200]  entire intro word for word. Nailed it, girl. Good job. Mental fist bump. Thanks for joining
[01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:15.200]  me on the show, Lindsay. Welcome back.

[01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:32.200]  I'd be one of those, yeah.
[01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:34.200]  You'd be one of those. Shout out to the Boston Nation ladies.
[01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:35.200]  Yeah.
[01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:39.200]  Also, you guys, to my left here, one of our favorites, a crowd favorite, Mr. White Mike
[01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:40.200]  is back.
[01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:41.200]  What's up, everybody?
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:42.200]  Thanks for joining me, bro.
[01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:43.200]  Yeah, man.

[01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:46.200]  Yep.

[01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:14.200]  Yes.
[01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:17.200]  Thank you, guys. Everybody in the room right now has this dab the fuck out look on their
[01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:18.200]  face.
[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:19.200]  We're a little glazed, folks.
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:23.200]  Mike's like, let's get really high for this episode. And nobody in the room argued that.
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:24.200]  Everyone was like, I like this idea.
[01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:25.200]  I'm mad.
[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:26.200]  Everybody jumped right on that idea.
[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:30.200]  We got a little roasted. I noticed that as soon as I hit play on the opening track, I
[01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:33.200]  wanted to cough real hard. So getting through that intro was awesome. I was proud of myself.
[01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:34.200]  Yep.
[01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:38.200]  Speaking of dabbing, this episode is going to be a lot about dabbing, you guys. But coming
[01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:43.200]  up in a future episode, it has been confirmed, we are going to have the wonderful, the Miss
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:46.200]  Dabbing Granny on the podcast. So if you know about the Dabbing Granny, stay tuned
[01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:49.200]  for future episodes. She will be joining us. I'm not sure if I'm going to her, if she's
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:54.200]  coming to me. Lindsey, can you tell us a little bit about your friend, the Dabbing Granny?
[01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:58.200]  Yeah. So, Gail.
[01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:03.200]  Oh, dropping the real name. Name dropping like you're the homie now. You just kick it
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:04.200]  with Gail?
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:11.200]  You guys are so... Oh, man. All right. I guess that's how this is going to go.
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:19.200]  Anyways, Dabbing Granny, because I just feel so... Whatever. Dabbing Granny and I met in
[01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:25.200]  Colorado Springs. We actually have hung out at Canna Canyon a couple times and gotten
[01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:32.200]  to take some dabs. And we got to hang out with Brett, Mary's Motivation. I actually
[01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:36.200]  left work for lunch for 30 minutes and got to go over to Canna Canyon and hang out with
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:44.200]  Brett, THC Sam, THC Magazine Sam, and a couple other people, Chandler and a couple other
[01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:52.200]  people. Yeah, it was super fun. But yeah, she's just big on social media because everybody
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:55.200]  wants to follow a Dabbing Granny.
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:59.200]  So, yeah. Shout out to Dabbing Granny. Also, she listens to the podcast. When you told
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:03.200]  me that she listens to the podcast, it put the biggest smile on my face.
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:09.200]  So, actually, you have Brett to thank for that. And well, I mean, like I was just sitting
[01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:17.200]  there. But we were... Brett and I were talking about the podcast at Canna Canyon that day.
[01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:24.200]  And Granny was like, what podcast is this? And Brett said, give me your phone. He took
[01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:29.200]  the phone from her and he subscribed her to the podcast. And he goes, here you go. And
[01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:33.200]  so she turns to me and she said, you're on this? And I said, I said, I'm very fortunate.
[01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:36.200]  I said, Jeff has me on the podcast way more than I should be on here.
[01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:39.200]  I'm fortunate to have you. So it's a mutual thing.
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:44.200]  So she started listening to them. And so like, I guess one of the first couple of ones that
[01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:48.200]  I don't know what the first couple of ones she listens to actually were, but she listened
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:52.200]  to the dispensary talk one with the three of us. And she commented on my something and
[01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:57.200]  she was like, oh, was it me that you were talking about flirting with you in the dispensary?
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:35:59.200]  Of course it was.
[01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:00.200]  That's what I said.
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:03.200]  So nobody, a lot of people might know who we're talking about. You guys check out the
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:10.200]  dabbing granny on Instagram. She's on Facebook. When I discovered her, she took a giant dab,
[01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:11.200]  like a big dab, you guys.
[01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:17.200]  Like a hundred of my dabs. The first time I saw the video, I felt so bad about the size
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:19.200]  of my dab for like the rest of the day.
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:23.200]  She's a little young to be my granny, but she could be Lindsay's granny. She could definitely
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:26.200]  be your granny. So she's a granny. She's for sure. We're not being derogatory calling her
[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:27.200]  granny. She's damn granny.
[01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:31.200]  Her Instagram handle is dabbing underscore granny. I don't think it's.
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:35.200]  And I'm pretty sure it's the dabbing granny on YouTube.
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:37.200]  There you go. I didn't know about her YouTube.
[01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:40.200]  Oh, I think that's where she shouted out your thing.
[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:42.200]  Thanks for the shout out, dabbing granny. Granny, Gail.
[01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:43.200]  I gotta figure out where that is.
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:45.200]  Whatever I'm supposed to call you. Granny. We're just going to go with granny. I like
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:50.200]  that one. So she takes a giant dab off of a rig and then she chugs a beer, like a whole
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:55.200]  pint glass. And then she takes a shot and then she blows out her dab and takes another dab
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:59.200]  from the nectar collector and smiles into the camera like that's how you do it, bitches.
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:01.200]  And then ends the video.
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:07.200]  So that's actually like one of her staple things. She kind of like changes it around
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:12.200]  a little bit, but like I'm pretty sure she did that on Facebook live today or some version
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:18.200]  of that, you know, like a dab, a beer and then like a shot and then something, you know
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:22.200]  what I mean? Like a bong rip or something. I don't know. But yeah. So I think she does
[01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:26.200]  some sort of variation and that's her like, I think she calls it her party trick.
[01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:27.200]  Okay.
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:31.200]  I could be wrong. I really could be wrong on that. But yeah, that's I think that's where
[01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:32.200]  she really.
[01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:34.200]  It's her version of the strikeout.
[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:38.200]  Yeah. It's impressive is all how the first time I watched the video.
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:40.200]  It's so impressive.
[01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:45.200]  It caught my eye because it was someone who could be my grandmother with a dab lined up
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:50.200]  that was like, I mean, it was YouTube dab worthy size. It was massive.
[01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:51.200]  It's a dab.
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:57.200]  I like to my pinky, maybe half a gram, three quarters of a gram. And then she takes this
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:03.200]  dab like a champ. And as I'm sitting there like, wow, she like throws down a pint and
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:09.200]  then does a bong rip and then exhales the bong rip and the dab. And I'm looking at this
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:13.200]  video and my mind just shocked at what I'm seeing. I was instantly a fan.
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:17.200]  So I bet a lot of people, her YouTube, her Facebook or Instagram is just exploding as
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:21.200]  people listen to this. You guys go support dabbing granny. Granny, we're going to get
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:24.200]  you on the podcast really soon. Look forward to that in a future episode. You guys, she's
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:28.200]  a patient. She's a cannabis advocate. She's a smoker, but she's a savage. It's my favorite
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:29.200]  part about her.
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:30.200]  Me too.
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:33.200]  She seems to be super sweet from everything I've seen. All right, granny. Can't wait to
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:37.200]  have you on the show. Lindsay, thanks for arranging that. That's your fault. You said
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:40.200]  blame Brett. Brett, thanks for arranging that. That's your fault. You guys got granny. I
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:43.200]  didn't reach out to her. You guys did that. You got her listening. You brought her here.
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:45.200]  That's that's your guys's fault. Thank you.
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:50.200]  That's what I love about the idea of places like Canada Canyon. It's the community doesn't
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:54.200]  have any good place to meet up. And as soon as we started getting them really cool connections
[01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:56.200]  started being made.
[01:38:56.200 --> 01:38:59.200]  Go ahead. You got something to say.
[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:03.200]  I thought you like, I thought you were meaning it in a negative way. And you're like, Lindsay,
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:06.200]  that's your fault. And I was like, Oh, no, no, no. I was picking on you.
[01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:10.200]  And something else Lindsay said that I really liked. Brett, right on for just grabbing someone's
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:15.200]  phone and subscribing them to my podcast. Just do that shit more frequently. Get my
[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:18.200]  phone and be like, here, you're subscribed to Ross DeGev's podcast now.
[01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:25.200]  Have you seen his Instagram lives? Like his snap? What the new Instagram, Snapchat thing?
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:26.200]  Oh, no, no.
[01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:31.200]  I have been in tears. The first one he ever put up was like, buy Snapchat. And it was
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:37.200]  loose like he's done. And then the next one was just something like, Oh, my God, I'm so
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:41.200]  excited about this. I can answer all your questions now. Like, yes. And he goes like
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:45.200]  down and then he comes back up and he's like, I am in my underwear right now. And like that
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:50.200]  was it. It just cuts off. And I was just like, yes, these are going to be so amazing.
[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:51.200]  I cannot wait.
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:53.200]  That dude's a really cool dude. Shout out to Brett. Thanks for all the support. Thanks
[01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:54.200]  for the Terp love.
[01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:55.200]  For sure.
[01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:59.200]  You guys want to talk about that new stupid Instagram feature? Want to just give it a
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:02.200]  second? There's a new feature on Instagram. I don't know if I care or not. I don't know
[01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:03.200]  if I like it.
[01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:05.200]  It's going to Snapchat.
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:08.200]  The reason I don't give out my Instagram is because I don't even use it.
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:09.200]  All right.
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:13.200]  Like I've only opened it when it says I have a bunch of notifications and I only open it
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:17.200]  to clear the notifications. It just feels like it never ends. There's just so many pictures
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:21.200]  that scroll by. I'm like, I don't even care. I forgot. I forgot that I don't care. That's
[01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:22.200]  right.
[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:29.200]  I think what you have to remember is that Instagram was originally just pictures. Look
[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:36.200]  at how far Instagram has actually evolved and what it actually started from. Can you
[01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:39.200]  really hate them for doing a live feature?
[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:40.200]  For trying to be Snapchat?
[01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:49.200]  Not even. I don't know. I don't really like, I have pros and cons about it, so I just don't
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:50.200]  really.
[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:53.200]  I just feel like they're trying to suck up too much of my attention. Now I can scroll
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:59.200]  up and down and left and right. It just fucks me all up. There's no end to it now because
[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:02.200]  I'm just like, oh, that's enough. I have to stop.
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:06.200]  All right. Since we're talking about social media, this is a good segue. Twitter people,
[01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:11.200]  I've got three names of folks that I have got envelopes with your name written on it.
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:14.200]  There's a stamp on there. There's a return address label on there that someone claimed
[01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:18.200]  was mediocre, but I think it's just fine. It's going to work just fine. There's a return
[01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:21.200]  address label on there. If that gets lost, it will get back to me. I'll get it back to
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:22.200]  you.
[01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:26.200]  For those of you that receive these, feel free to comment about the quality of the labels
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:27.200]  on Twitter.
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:30.200]  Please do. We'd love to hear your comments. There will be stickers in there for you. Those
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:35.200]  are to say thank you for participating in Twitter challenges or just for being a friend.
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:38.200]  If you guys want some stickers, contact me. Hit me up on Facebook. Hit me up on Instagram.
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:41.200]  Hit me up on the Twitter, or you can email me. It's girlfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:46.200]  The real trick is to listen to the whole episode when it's a longer one.
[01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:48.200]  Yes, that does help out. That pays off.
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:50.200]  Pro tip.
[01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:54.200]  Seriously, if you follow me on Twitter or Instagram or something, send me a message.
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:42:00.200]  Instagram is Irie, I-R-I-E, underscore genetics, Irie Genetics. If you used to be following
[01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:03.200]  me, you might not now because a long time ago, they crushed my account and I've started
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:09.200]  a new account. I had almost 20,000 followers. I'm only around 6,000 or 7,000 now. Come follow
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:11.200]  me again, please. That would be cool.
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:16.200]  On Twitter, it's at GFYH Podcast. On Facebook, it's Grow From Your Heart Podcast. Of course,
[01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:20.200]  there's the email that I like to say. It's at growfromyourheart.hotmail.com. Go search
[01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:24.200]  for me there. Find me. Email me. Contact me. I'd love to hear from you. Get you some stickers.
[01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:28.200]  These friends of mine are going to get some stickers. Big shout out to James Howlett.
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:31.200]  You're going to get some stickers in the mail. Jason Hawkins, you got stickers coming in
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:36.200]  the mail. Sammy, bro, you got some stickers coming in the mail, bro. My painted chef friend.
[01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:41.200]  Also, that segues right into the next part. How you guys like that? Double segue. We're
[01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:44.200]  doing a Grateful Dead style. One right into the other. We're not going to stop. Keep on
[01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:50.200]  jamming. Sammy asked about easy cloners. His basic question was, do you recommend an
[01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:55.200]  easy cloner? Do you like an easy cloner? Yes, I love an easy cloner. What I really like
[01:42:55.200 --> 01:43:01.200]  about an easy cloner is you can cut large clones. If you take big clones, they'll root
[01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:05.200]  quickly. Those big clones, I think they take off much more quickly than clones in Rockwell
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:10.200]  cubes. Mike remembers my old school days of trying to cut clones in Rockwell cubes.
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:15.200]  I took so many clones and put them in Rockwell cubes. I did that for a lot of years with
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:19.200]  a lot of different growers. Mike used to be a grow hand for everybody around here. Honestly,
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:27.200]  the easy cloner is a huge step up. In my mind, if you're growing and cloning regularly, it's
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:32.200]  worth the investment. Just make sure you get a good one. Do you remember your first easy
[01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:35.200]  cloner, bro? Yeah, let's not talk too much about that. We'll know, but two seconds after
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:39.200]  you had plugged it in, your advice would have been, don't buy one, they're crap.
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:42.200]  Yeah, those old ones sucked. The new models are awesome.
[01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:48.200]  Yeah, they worked out all the kinks. It doesn't explode and turn your grow room into a water
[01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:53.200]  park anymore. That's the best description. There are new models. The new easy cloners,
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:57.200]  the low, what do they call them? The low rise, the low profile models. They're white now.
[01:43:57.200 --> 01:44:01.200]  I really dig them. They require less water, which is really helpful because that also
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:05.200]  means less nutrients. I'm only familiar with the big black beast, but it gets the double
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:09.200]  thumbs up for me. It's the same thing, but just a new design. They used to leak. Remember
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:12.200]  how the old black ones used to spray out of the sides because they had the-
[01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:13.200]  A little bit, they drip a little.
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:17.200]  They don't leak or drip anymore. The new design is way better. They're easier to clean. I
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:21.200]  really like the new easy cloner. So Sammy, if you're looking to up your clone game, get
[01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:25.200]  yourself an easy cloner. It is super easy to use that thing. You need a healthy mother.
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:29.200]  Okay, get your cloner set up. By that I mean, get the cloner fucking built. Get the neoprenes
[01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:32.200]  in there. Get the little manifold in there. Get it spraying. Get it running. Fill it up
[01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:37.200]  with water just below those red sprayers. Remember how much water you put in it. Figure
[01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:41.200]  that out. Put nutrients in there. I would use a little bit of bloom, like your base
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:47.200]  bloom nutrient, a little bit of micro and just dip them in some- I like to use the easy
[01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:51.200]  cloner gel. What's that one called? Shit, I can't think of the name. Clonex. It's the
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:55.200]  purple clonex gel. I like to use that shit. Dip it in there. Put it in the little neoprene
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:59.200]  collar. Cut it to where there's like two or three nodes underneath that collar. Put that
[01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:03.200]  shit in the cloner. Put the cloner on for 45 minutes on, 15 minutes off because that
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:08.200]  water will heat up because of that pump. Put a T5 light about a foot above that and just
[01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:12.200]  let the T5 light run 24 hours a day. And no shit, in like seven or eight days, you'll
[01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:15.200]  start seeing little warts pop out of the plant and that's where the roots are going to grow.
[01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:19.200]  Like 10 to 14 days, you'll have savage roots. In 17 to 21 days, those roots are going to
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:23.200]  be so big you'll have to go to a three gallon pot and skip a cup.
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:27.200]  A huge step up in technology from the old school clone domes.
[01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:31.200]  Huge step up. So I highly, highly recommend those. We use those at the grow. I run a big
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:35.200]  commercial grow and I've got one, two, three, there are six easy cloners filled with clones
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:38.200]  right now at the grow and that's how we keep it.
[01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:42.200]  We could go on like this about the cloner for a while. It's really an awesome product.
[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:45.200]  So easy cloner, if you'd like to send me some easy cloners, hit me up. It's growformehard
[01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:49.200]  at hotmail.com. I could just use like 160 site or 190 site, you know, just my personal
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:53.200]  setup. I don't need anything for the store. Just send me one. I'd appreciate that.
[01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:58.200]  Yeah. All right. So Sammy, I hope I answered your question, but I hope it's not too late.
[01:45:58.200 --> 01:46:01.200]  I know that took me a while to get to that message. I apologize. I do one episode a week.
[01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:05.200]  I need to fix that. If I did two a week, I could probably get more questions answered.
[01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:08.200]  That's what I think. Lindsey, you all right over there? Headphones all right?
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:09.200]  No, my ear.
[01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:10.200]  You getting headphone ear?
[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:11.200]  No, I have a...
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:12.200]  You have a ear?
[01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:13.200]  I have... yeah.
[01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:14.200]  You have a ear?
[01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:15.200]  Never mind. You guys...
[01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:16.200]  Two of them, even.
[01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:18.200]  It's not even worth it tonight. I don't feel like...
[01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:21.200]  It's kind of late at night. Lindsey's real high, so picking on her is way too simple.
[01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:24.200]  This is the dab episode. We got good and fried to start.
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:28.200]  Yes. All right. Mike just segued us right in again. He's jamming us right into the next topic.
[01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:31.200]  On the last episode, we talked a lot about dabbing and stuff, and I wanted to talk about
[01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:36.200]  email temperature and getting your email set to the temperature that is perfect for you
[01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:40.200]  because I like my email a little bit hot. If Spence was here... Spence from Gardner Weedon.
[01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:42.200]  Shout out to my brother Spence. I miss you, bro.
[01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:44.200]  He would crack me up every time he did this.
[01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:47.200]  Spence would reach right over and just turn my email down like, motherfucker, that's too hot.
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:49.200]  And he would just turn it down like he owned that bitch.
[01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:52.200]  He at least scold you for having it too hot.
[01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:55.200]  Yeah, but you know it's my email, and I like them hot.
[01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:57.200]  Well, it was just a beautiful thing to watch.
[01:46:57.200 --> 01:47:00.200]  It was pretty funny. It was pretty funny. But I just let Spence do his thing.
[01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:03.200]  He's a hash maker, and he would bring over slabs and dab me out with them,
[01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:05.200]  and you could make it whatever temp you want if you're going to drop that much hash on there.
[01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:09.200]  Do your thing, player. But most people keep their emails a little lower than I do.
[01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:14.200]  I like mine a little hot. Somebody was asking me, how do I get my email to the perfect temperature?
[01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:18.200]  The temperature is all kind of subjective. It's all about do you want it hot and hurdy?
[01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:20.200]  Do you want it low temp, all taste?
[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:24.200]  Some of the new trend is to heat a nail, and this is not the email.
[01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:29.200]  This is if you're using like a banger. The new trend is to heat the nail, let it get way too hot,
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:34.200]  and then let it cool way down, and then put your dab on there and waste half the fucking dab,
[01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:38.200]  and then act like it tasted real good, and then get a Q-tip and clean it off.
[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:41.200]  That's what all the trendy kids are doing now. That's what you see at all the events.
[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:46.200]  That is not my style. I like to heat it, and when it's hot enough to cook the dab,
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:50.200]  I drop a real big dab on it and make sure it all cooks, and I get a big, thick, fat, milky hit
[01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:53.200]  that makes my eyes water and makes my lungs kind of twitter a little bit,
[01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:56.200]  and I put a carb cap on it and make it even fatter, and I like to get a fat dab.
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:48:00.200]  So sending the email to the perfect temp is kind of subjective for you.
[01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:04.200]  The way I would say to do it, and use a carb cap. Definitely use a carb cap.
[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:09.200]  I actually went and Googled a part about a carb cap. Let's talk about a carb cap for a second here.
[01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:13.200]  This actually comes from High Times Magazine, and it was written, I wrote it down,
[01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:18.200]  it's written by Sean Black. It says like this, the carb cap is exactly what it sounds like.
[01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:23.200]  A carburetor for your rig. It restricts, restricts? What the fuck does that word mean?
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:28.200]  It restricts the amount of airflow to your nail, allowing you to collect the last bits of your oil
[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:33.200]  to punctuate the end of your hit. And this is the part that's important.
[01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:37.200]  By capping the nail, you restrict the airflow into the rig through the small contact area
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:42.200]  between the cap and the edge of the nail. While inhaling strongly, the reduced airflow
[01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:47.200]  places the entire rig under low pressure, including the oil that pooled on the nail without vaporizing.
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:52.200]  Under low pressure, every component of the hash oil suddenly has a lower boiling temperature.
[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:57.200]  What once boiled, it should say which, which once boiled at high temperatures
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:02.200]  can now do so at much lower temperatures, giving you a bloom of thicker, better tasting smoke.
[01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:08.200]  The carb cap lets you actually finish the dab instead of wasting it in a thick, sputtering puddle.
[01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:13.200]  The trend now, you guys, is that thick, spluttering puddle because everyone wants to taste the Terps.
[01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:17.200]  Terps is the new word. Terps is the new thing. I like that carb cap description there.
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:22.200]  So you get your e-mail. You guys set it too hot. Set it too low. Just go one direction.
[01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:29.200]  I recommend just slowly climb up. You're looking for the sweet spot in between wasting a lot of your product
[01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:33.200]  and burning the living fuck out of your throat like I did to myself last night.
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:36.200]  How far away right now is my finger from the top of that nail?
[01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:37.200]  Inch and a half.
[01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:42.200]  Perfect. That's what I thought. So put your fingers an inch to two inches above the nail,
[01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:47.200]  and it should be able to sit there comfortably for like one or two seconds before you're like, ooh, that's hot.
[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:51.200]  It should feel like your finger is getting pinched, like someone's just pinching your finger a little bit.
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:54.200]  That's about the right temperature where I like it. Do you agree?
[01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:56.200]  Kind of feels like you're getting pinched after a couple seconds.
[01:49:56.200 --> 01:50:00.200]  See, the toy that I should have now that I don't is a LazerTown.
[01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:02.200]  Oh, I've got one of those in my living room.
[01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:03.200]  I have one at home too.
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:07.200]  Literally, I've left the house with money in my pocket to go buy one a couple of times,
[01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:10.200]  and something happens, and I end up at home without one.
[01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:15.200]  It's just not in the cards because it's not necessary. It's just something I want.
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:20.200]  I might have to. Remind me of this conversation in a much soberer way.
[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:21.200]  Magic just happened here.
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:22.200]  It could have.
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:24.200]  All right. It depends on what kind of hash you're smoking also.
[01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:27.200]  If you're smoking Shatter, like this Shatter, you could put it on there kind of hot.
[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:29.200]  If I had some wax, it'd probably go hotter.
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:33.200]  If I was smoking Live Res, I might turn it down just a bit to get more of that taste.
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:36.200]  So, it depends on the concentrate you've got, you guys.
[01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:38.200]  Get the concentrate that you've got. Get the nail set a little bit low.
[01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:42.200]  Put the dab on there. If it doesn't, put the carb cap on. Start smoking.
[01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:45.200]  If that dab doesn't melt enough, obviously, turn that shit up,
[01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:49.200]  and just go five or ten degrees higher every time until you get the dab you want.
[01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:51.200]  I can't recommend the carb cap enough.
[01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:56.200]  The first time you use one, when you throw it on top of the nail,
[01:50:56.200 --> 01:51:00.200]  the first thing that goes through your head is, where'd all that come from?
[01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:04.200]  As you watch the vapor going through your rig quadruple and thicken,
[01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:07.200]  because that wasn't on your nail a second ago.
[01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:10.200]  Had you taken a breath and hit it, you wouldn't have gotten any of that,
[01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:14.200]  and suddenly you've got a huge milked-out rig going for you again.
[01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:17.200]  It's so sweet. I love just when you cap it, and you just see it,
[01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:19.200]  and you just start pulling, like, ah, there you go.
[01:51:19.200 --> 01:51:23.200]  Yep. That's part of the reason I've been so baked the last couple of shows I've done,
[01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:26.200]  is I didn't have one at home for the last several months,
[01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:31.200]  and was not getting nearly as stoned at home because I didn't have all the tools with me.
[01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:34.200]  So when you drop the carb cap on there, you guys, you're pulling your hit,
[01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:36.200]  you're taking your hit, and then you get enough smoke to fill your lungs,
[01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:38.200]  you want to blow out so that you can pull the rest of that.
[01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:41.200]  Don't take the carb cap off, because at that time,
[01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:45.200]  you're letting all that vapor and that pressure and that vacuum that you've created,
[01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:47.200]  you've just ruined that by letting the carb cap off.
[01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:50.200]  Leave that carb cap on there almost until you're done dabbing.
[01:51:50.200 --> 01:51:52.200]  Sometimes it's a good idea to lift it, because that fucker gets hot.
[01:51:52.200 --> 01:51:56.200]  But just put it on there, inhale, blow your hit out, leave the cap on, inhale the rest,
[01:51:56.200 --> 01:51:58.200]  and then take it off as soon as you're done.
[01:51:58.200 --> 01:52:03.200]  Don't take it off until you're done dabbing, because a lot of folks lose part of their dab that way.
[01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:05.200]  I've seen people feather them and try to get fancy with it,
[01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:07.200]  and just set it on there and let her go.
[01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:10.200]  One thing I do, I honestly do turn it a little bit.
[01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:12.200]  There's one hole in there, in the top of that carb cap,
[01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:15.200]  and I like to turn it just because I think that I move my oil.
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:16.200]  I take a larger dab than most folks.
[01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:18.200]  No, I agree with you, and that's one of the things.
[01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:21.200]  So I need to spread it across the top of the nail just a little bit more than some,
[01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:24.200]  and I'm not trying to be an elitist, I just take big fucking dabs.
[01:52:24.200 --> 01:52:28.200]  When we're talking temperature, I can get away with a much lower temp
[01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:34.200]  and not waste anything because I'm putting a much smaller dab to the nail each time.
[01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:36.200]  Not like I'm hot and dirty.
[01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:41.200]  You can't do a low temp half gram or a gram dab.
[01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:45.200]  You end up doing a .2 dab and the rest of it puddles,
[01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:49.200]  and then you feel like a dick for wasting a bunch of your hash.
[01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:51.200]  I want to mention one more thing,
[01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:54.200]  and then you just kind of segued me into another part I want to talk about.
[01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:59.200]  You guys, when you're taking a dab with a carb cap and you're using an e-nail,
[01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:02.200]  this happened at the Canna Canyon, and it happens here occasionally.
[01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:04.200]  I just wanted to bring this up for the folks that are learning to dab
[01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:06.200]  and even the experienced dabbers.
[01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:11.200]  Bruh, when you're done dabbing, take the carb cap off the e-nail
[01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:13.200]  because that e-nail is turned on and it's hot,
[01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:16.200]  and you leave that carb cap on there and it heats up the carb cap,
[01:53:16.200 --> 01:53:19.200]  and then whoever sees it wants to take a dab.
[01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:21.200]  They're not thinking about that is hot.
[01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:23.200]  They're thinking, I want to dab, and they reach for the carb cap,
[01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:25.200]  and they burn the shit out of themselves.
[01:53:25.200 --> 01:53:26.200]  So be careful.
[01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:30.200]  Please take that carb cap off of the e-nail.
[01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:32.200]  Just set it on an oil slick pad.
[01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:33.200]  I see so many people.
[01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:35.200]  There's an oil slick pad on my table.
[01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:37.200]  This pad is designed to catch hash.
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:38.200]  It will not stick to here.
[01:53:38.200 --> 01:53:42.200]  My table right here, this wood part, the hash will stick to this all fucking day.
[01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:45.200]  Just put the carb cap down on the oil slick pad.
[01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:47.200]  If you see one, that's what that's for.
[01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:48.200]  Utilize that.
[01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:49.200]  All right.
[01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:54.200]  Now, I said that would segue me into another part that I wanted to talk about.
[01:53:54.200 --> 01:54:00.200]  When we're giving dabs to somebody, is it up to me to heat that?
[01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:04.200]  I feel like if I give you a dab, and this will be another question I'm going to ask,
[01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:07.200]  one of us pulls a dab off the parchment paper for you.
[01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:10.200]  I'll heat the rig to be nice just because we're dabbing at my spot or in my car
[01:54:10.200 --> 01:54:11.200]  or wherever we happen to be.
[01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:13.200]  I'm going to heat the – I know, Mike.
[01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:14.200]  I know. I'm sorry.
[01:54:14.200 --> 01:54:16.200]  I'm going to heat the nail to the appropriate temperature, and then I'm going to –
[01:54:16.200 --> 01:54:20.200]  maybe we're camping, and I'm going to heat the nail to the appropriate temperature,
[01:54:20.200 --> 01:54:21.200]  and I'm going to hand it to you.
[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:24.200]  Do I hang on to that fucker until it's the right temp,
[01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:28.200]  or do I give it to you and let you decide when to dab that thing?
[01:54:30.200 --> 01:54:35.200]  So much just depends on who you're talking about handing it to and their level of experience.
[01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:37.200]  That's what I was just going to say.
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:42.200]  If it's someone new and new to dabbing, I would just be like, okay.
[01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:46.200]  I would just probably hold on to it until it was ready and then give it to them.
[01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:51.200]  But if it's somebody you know dabs a lot, let them make that choice.
[01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:55.200]  Heat it up, hand it to them, let them do the hand over the nail like a wizard trick.
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:54:59.200]  Right, because do you remember a couple weeks ago when we were having a conversation
[01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:02.200]  about how somebody heated up a torch – like a break free and wouldn't –
[01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:03.200]  That's what this is all about.
[01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:04.200]  Yeah.
[01:55:04.200 --> 01:55:05.200]  That's where this came from.
[01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:09.200]  Somebody tried to be nice and give me a big fat dab, and they heated the nail nice and hot,
[01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:12.200]  and when I went to pick up the rig, they put their hand on it and said, it's too hot.
[01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:16.200]  I'm polite. I'm like, cool, you're giving me a dab. I'll let you do your thing.
[01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:19.200]  But in my mind, I thought it's going to cool down way too much,
[01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:22.200]  and this big dab is just going to end up as a puddle on your nail.
[01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:26.200]  And these guys were proud of how much they cleaned out of their rig with the Q-tip.
[01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:30.200]  I want to smoke that, bro. Put that in my lungs. We paid for it.
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:34.200]  The dispensary wasn't like, oh, you're going to Q-tip it? Here's 30% off.
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:37.200]  I don't understand how people can waste that amount of –
[01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:43.200]  it's like when you're paying 20, 30, 60, 80, 100 a gram for hash,
[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:49.200]  how do you waste half of it on just letting it puddle and then Q-tipping it into the trash?
[01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:53.200]  That's like taking two sips off your beer and putting the whole bottle,
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:56.200]  the rest of the bottle of the trash and ordering another beer and drinking that way all night.
[01:55:56.200 --> 01:55:57.200]  Like, what are you doing?
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:03.200]  So if it's an experienced dabber, let that dude choose how hot he wants it.
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:08.200]  If I want to burn my lungs, if I want to roast my esophagus, let me do it, please.
[01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:12.200]  But when you're bringing new people in, be gentle.
[01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:17.200]  A lot of us have a good story about the introducing someone to hash where they were like,
[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:20.200]  no, I want to take the hit you took.
[01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:23.200]  And we give it one or two, no, you don't, bro.
[01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:28.200]  Like, just a bit of advice, go slow, very strong.
[01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:32.200]  And they resist a little bit, so we say, fuck it, and let them jump off the cliff.
[01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:33.200]  That's not necessarily cool.
[01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:38.200]  I've told the story of the dude, a guy, I was at a cannabis cup and I was taking dabs.
[01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:40.200]  And a guy walked up and he said, what are you doing there, bro?
[01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:41.200]  And I was like, smoking dabs.
[01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:43.200]  And he's like, I ain't never seen dabs before, can I get a dab?
[01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:44.200]  And I was like, sure.
[01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:47.200]  And I gave him what I thought would be a normal first dab for a guy.
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:48.200]  And he got offended.
[01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:52.200]  He's like, that's a little, I saw what you smoked, give me what you smoked.
[01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:54.200]  And I was like, I've been doing this, bro, that's going to fuck you up.
[01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:56.200]  He's like, I don't care, I can smoke.
[01:56:56.200 --> 01:57:00.200]  And so I did what he asked for and I gave him a Jeff size dab, heated up, hooked him up.
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:04.200]  That dude took that hit and pulled in the smoke and blew it out and vanished.
[01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:07.200]  He walked into the crowd like, bye, I got to go.
[01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:09.200]  He was so high, he didn't know what to do with himself.
[01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:10.200]  He couldn't look me in the eye anymore.
[01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:12.200]  He was done.
[01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:13.200]  But I thought it was kind of funny.
[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:15.200]  But that's what he asked for.
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:21.200]  I spent like a good chunk of my day explaining to people who aren't familiar with hash and edibles to please go slow.
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:27.200]  I talk to people all the time that have, I took the way too big a dab.
[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:32.200]  And it was like the longest 12 hours of my life while I waited to come down.
[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:36.200]  And I feel bad for those people and it's unnecessary.
[01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:38.200]  Like we used to be a little gentler with it.
[01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:43.200]  And there used to be an initiation process before these products were available.
[01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:48.200]  And it negated the necessity to do, to say a lot of this stuff.
[01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:52.200]  There are people out there whose first experience with cannabis was a dab.
[01:57:52.200 --> 01:57:53.200]  Yeah.
[01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:54.200]  That's unfair.
[01:57:54.200 --> 01:57:59.200]  That's like the first time you drank when you were in middle school or a teenager or whatever.
[01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:03.200]  You had moonshine and you guys were fucking beer funneling it.
[01:58:03.200 --> 01:58:06.200]  It's so unnecessary.
[01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:08.200]  Oh God.
[01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:10.200]  That's their boof and shine for your first time.
[01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:11.200]  Right?
[01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:13.200]  Like it's like, why would you do that?
[01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:21.200]  And it's the same thing when I hear like, my first intro to marijuana was a giant dab alive resin.
[01:58:21.200 --> 01:58:23.200]  And it's like, and what happened next?
[01:58:23.200 --> 01:58:27.200]  You spent seven hours in your hotel room wondering if you were dead or not.
[01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:30.200]  And it's just, you were too big to handle it.
[01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:32.200]  And it never should have happened.
[01:58:32.200 --> 01:58:34.200]  Like you didn't need to be in that end of the pool.
[01:58:34.200 --> 01:58:35.200]  Go slow.
[01:58:35.200 --> 01:58:37.200]  Do I need to put a disclaimer on my dab videos?
[01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:38.200]  Do not try this at home?
[01:58:38.200 --> 01:58:39.200]  Probably.
[01:58:39.200 --> 01:58:40.200]  That might be a good idea, huh?
[01:58:40.200 --> 01:58:45.200]  So I think with that, going back to your original question here, Jeff,
[01:58:45.200 --> 01:58:50.200]  I think it's about knowing your audience and about knowing like who's in your car.
[01:58:50.200 --> 01:58:55.200]  Like if it's a, you know, experienced dabber, let them do it.
[01:58:55.200 --> 01:58:57.200]  But if not, then, uh.
[01:58:57.200 --> 01:58:59.200]  But I first heard you guys.
[01:58:59.200 --> 01:59:01.200]  You guys are the worst tonight.
[01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:04.200]  You guys are just trolling me.
[01:59:04.200 --> 01:59:07.200]  No, no, we're mad at ourselves because we're setting a bad example.
[01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:09.200]  We're talking about dabbing in the car, which shouldn't happen.
[01:59:09.200 --> 01:59:10.200]  We're hypocrites.
[01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:11.200]  We're, uh.
[01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:12.200]  I didn't even mean in the car.
[01:59:12.200 --> 01:59:14.200]  I just meant in general.
[01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:15.200]  Did I say in the car?
[01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:19.200]  We've all, you and I each have slipped about dabbing in the car.
[01:59:19.200 --> 01:59:20.200]  Sorry.
[01:59:20.200 --> 01:59:21.200]  Yeah.
[01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:22.200]  Like we're outdoorsy.
[01:59:22.200 --> 01:59:23.200]  It's Colorado.
[01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:24.200]  We spend a lot of time camping.
[01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:30.200]  I actually do take, I do smoke a lot more in nature.
[01:59:30.200 --> 01:59:33.200]  I think it's fucking fun to dab in the car wash when you're getting the car wash.
[01:59:33.200 --> 01:59:35.200]  I've never done that before.
[01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:36.200]  No one can see you.
[01:59:36.200 --> 01:59:37.200]  You're just blasted dabs.
[01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:38.200]  I don't dab in the car.
[01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:39.200]  I don't.
[01:59:39.200 --> 01:59:40.200]  None of my shit's portable.
[01:59:40.200 --> 01:59:41.200]  Like that's not something I do.
[01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:43.200]  It's all portable to me, bro.
[01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:44.200]  I've had the.
[01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:45.200]  Yeah.
[01:59:45.200 --> 01:59:46.200]  No, I know.
[01:59:46.200 --> 01:59:47.200]  I know.
[01:59:47.200 --> 01:59:48.200]  They make an adapter for the email.
[01:59:48.200 --> 01:59:49.200]  Yes, they do.
[01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:50.200]  All right.
[01:59:50.200 --> 01:59:53.200]  Let's get, let's get out of the incrimination zone here.
[01:59:53.200 --> 01:59:54.200]  So dab size.
[01:59:54.200 --> 01:59:55.200]  I like the temp thing.
[01:59:55.200 --> 01:59:56.200]  If it's somebody new.
[01:59:56.200 --> 01:59:57.200]  Yeah.
[01:59:57.200 --> 01:59:58.200]  If it, yeah.
[01:59:58.200 --> 01:59:59.200]  Just bring them along.
[01:59:59.200 --> 02:00:02.200]  Maybe decide the temp for your girlfriend's dab for her.
[02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:06.200]  But most of us, we can decide our own temp of our own dabs.
[02:00:06.200 --> 02:00:07.200]  We can handle that.
[02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:12.200]  If I'm wearing my logo on my shirt and I'm at every fucking secret session you see me at,
[02:00:12.200 --> 02:00:14.200]  let me choose my temp on my dab.
[02:00:14.200 --> 02:00:15.200]  I want to go hot and hurty.
[02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:16.200]  Red means go.
[02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:17.200]  Red means go.
[02:00:17.200 --> 02:00:18.200]  You guys don't do glowy's.
[02:00:18.200 --> 02:00:19.200]  That's what we call those glowy's.
[02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:20.200]  Don't do those.
[02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:21.200]  Those hurt your lungs.
[02:00:21.200 --> 02:00:22.200]  Those are, don't do that.
[02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:23.200]  Yeah.
[02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:24.200]  So let's talk about dab size.
[02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:25.200]  We're, we're all friends here.
[02:00:25.200 --> 02:00:26.200]  So when we have dabs, we come to the table.
[02:00:26.200 --> 02:00:27.200]  We just, there's some of my hash on the table.
[02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:28.200]  Lindsay's got some hash on the table.
[02:00:28.200 --> 02:00:29.200]  Mike didn't bring any today, but I'm not calling him out.
[02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:30.200]  Last time he brought some hash that tasted fucking tremendous.
[02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:31.200]  I racked myself with that shit.
[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:32.200]  It was so flavorful.
[02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:33.200]  You're excused this time because it was so good last time.
[02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:34.200]  But we all, if somebody wants a dab, this is my, this is my, this is my favorite.
[02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:35.200]  I'm not going to lie.
[02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:36.200]  I'm not going to lie.
[02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:55.200]  I'm just going to pass him the parchment.
[02:00:55.200 --> 02:00:56.200]  He's going to pull off a dab for himself.
[02:00:56.200 --> 02:00:57.200]  Cause that's my homie over there.
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:00:58.200]  Is that how are you supposed to, am I supposed to pull him off a dab or is that his job or.
[02:00:58.200 --> 02:00:59.200]  I, I, I don't know.
[02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:00.200]  I don't know.
[02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:01.200]  I don't know.
[02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:02.200]  I don't know.
[02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:03.200]  I don't know.
[02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:04.200]  I don't know.
[02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:05.200]  I don't know.
[02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:08.000]  I think Lindsay said it perfectly a second ago.
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.520]  It's about knowing your audience, depends on who's who.
[02:01:10.520 --> 02:01:11.520]  Huh?
[02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:12.520]  Yeah.
[02:01:12.520 --> 02:01:13.520]  I guess that's true.
[02:01:13.520 --> 02:01:15.440]  Like, you know, you always get that one kid.
[02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:20.360]  Uh, you know, so say we were hanging out at the secret sesh and we're all a bunch of friends.
[02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:21.720]  We're a bunch of heads or a bunch of family.
[02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:23.560]  And there's always one guy in every fucking group.
[02:01:23.560 --> 02:01:25.340]  And you know who I'm thinking about right now?
[02:01:25.340 --> 02:01:28.980]  That guy, if you hand him your shatter, he's going to try to smoke all of this in one day
[02:01:28.980 --> 02:01:32.320]  just because he wants to smoke as much as he can while he's there and get as high as
[02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:33.320]  he can.
[02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:37.060]  Everybody, every group has that one guy, that one friend.
[02:01:37.060 --> 02:01:39.300]  I think it's funny when people ask me for a dab
[02:01:39.300 --> 02:01:41.180]  and they try to do that because then I get to watch them
[02:01:41.180 --> 02:01:43.420]  cough and turn red and turn purple
[02:01:43.420 --> 02:01:45.280]  and blow snot out of their face.
[02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:46.120]  It's worth it to me.
[02:01:46.120 --> 02:01:48.380]  Yeah, go ahead and pick your dab size.
[02:01:48.380 --> 02:01:50.300]  No, the best part for me is watching them
[02:01:50.300 --> 02:01:52.060]  function after that.
[02:01:52.060 --> 02:01:53.140]  Or fail to function after that.
[02:01:53.140 --> 02:01:55.540]  Yeah, exactly, because you know what, Jeff?
[02:01:55.540 --> 02:01:59.020]  The thing about it is is they watch people like you
[02:01:59.020 --> 02:02:01.580]  take huge dabs and, you know,
[02:02:01.580 --> 02:02:06.580]  be able to just take .5, you know, or bigger dabs.
[02:02:07.180 --> 02:02:08.020]  And they sit here and go,
[02:02:08.020 --> 02:02:10.620]  well, I can go on this level with this guy.
[02:02:10.620 --> 02:02:14.980]  And they take this one, they die,
[02:02:14.980 --> 02:02:16.360]  and then they can't function.
[02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:18.040]  And do you know what you do?
[02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:21.900]  You continue to take .5 or bigger dabs
[02:02:21.900 --> 02:02:23.460]  and you keep going through the night
[02:02:23.460 --> 02:02:26.700]  and they're just like, what is this guy doing?
[02:02:26.700 --> 02:02:27.700]  I've been training, bro.
[02:02:27.700 --> 02:02:28.900]  Yeah. Been training.
[02:02:28.900 --> 02:02:29.740]  This is your triathlon.
[02:02:29.740 --> 02:02:30.940]  I've been going deep.
[02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:32.660]  This is your Olympics.
[02:02:32.660 --> 02:02:34.020]  It's just for comparison,
[02:02:34.020 --> 02:02:38.900]  there's more residue on the dabber I just used
[02:02:38.900 --> 02:02:40.600]  than the dab I just took.
[02:02:41.500 --> 02:02:43.200]  Mike, you're the Segway champion
[02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:46.620]  because I want to talk about ninja dabs right now.
[02:02:46.620 --> 02:02:48.540]  Oh, I love ninja dabs.
[02:02:48.540 --> 02:02:49.380]  Ninja dabs.
[02:02:50.380 --> 02:02:52.500]  So a lot of people, we take for granted
[02:02:52.500 --> 02:02:54.260]  that a lot of folks listening to this podcast
[02:02:54.260 --> 02:02:56.220]  are not Colorado-based people.
[02:02:56.220 --> 02:02:57.580]  I can tell by looking at the stats,
[02:02:57.580 --> 02:02:59.020]  I try to ignore them because I don't want it
[02:02:59.020 --> 02:03:00.940]  to influence my performance.
[02:03:00.940 --> 02:03:02.300]  But I can tell by looking at the stats
[02:03:02.300 --> 02:03:04.620]  that a large portion of our audience is in Colorado,
[02:03:04.620 --> 02:03:07.940]  but more than 50% is not Colorado-based
[02:03:07.940 --> 02:03:10.140]  and a large portion is not even in America.
[02:03:10.140 --> 02:03:11.580]  Those people don't get to dab.
[02:03:11.580 --> 02:03:13.540]  They don't know what dabs are.
[02:03:13.540 --> 02:03:14.980]  Somebody put me back on track.
[02:03:14.980 --> 02:03:15.820]  Ninja dabs.
[02:03:15.820 --> 02:03:17.140]  I'm gonna tell you what the fuck ninja dabs are.
[02:03:17.140 --> 02:03:18.620]  Ninja dabs.
[02:03:18.620 --> 02:03:20.560]  So if Lindsey was to get herself a dab
[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:22.020]  and she was to start dabbing,
[02:03:22.020 --> 02:03:24.620]  I would sneakily, I've got my MacBook here open.
[02:03:24.620 --> 02:03:26.900]  I would, while she can't see me behind the computer,
[02:03:26.900 --> 02:03:28.680]  I'd put another dab on another dabber.
[02:03:29.380 --> 02:03:30.560]  And as soon as Lindsey starts inhaling that dab,
[02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:32.080]  right before she puts the carb cap on,
[02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:35.120]  I would reach over and put a sizable amount of hash
[02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:37.840]  on the nail for her and ninja dab her.
[02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:39.760]  Just get that, just add a little to her
[02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:41.900]  and make her cough and get her a little extra fucked up
[02:03:41.900 --> 02:03:43.600]  more than she expected.
[02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:47.360]  I've also seen it referred to putting a dab
[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:49.440]  underneath the carb cap.
[02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:51.720]  So you like, the carb cap is just a,
[02:03:51.720 --> 02:03:53.240]  it's a hunk of metal with a hole in it
[02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:55.280]  that you set on top of the hot nail.
[02:03:55.280 --> 02:03:56.960]  So if you take some hash
[02:03:56.960 --> 02:04:00.200]  and surreptitiously place it underneath the carb cap,
[02:04:00.200 --> 02:04:03.440]  while that carb, or while their carb cap's on their cap
[02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:04.920]  and their dab, it's gonna heat up enough
[02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:06.560]  to drop that on the nail.
[02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:09.500]  So you get a good three, four, five, 10 seconds
[02:04:09.500 --> 02:04:12.040]  into their hit, their hit quadruples all of a sudden.
[02:04:12.040 --> 02:04:13.400]  And they don't even know where it came from.
[02:04:13.400 --> 02:04:15.320]  Yep, that's happened to me more than once
[02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:17.720]  and has led to some less than productive afternoons.
[02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:22.000]  I've called those time bombs or landmines,
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.240]  but I've also heard them called sniper dabs
[02:04:24.240 --> 02:04:25.240]  from other folks.
[02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:26.080]  I've got multiple carb caps.
[02:04:26.080 --> 02:04:28.160]  Landmines and ninja dabs were always
[02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:29.160]  what I heard those called.
[02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:30.480]  I've got multiple carb caps
[02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:31.840]  and I'll just set them out on the table
[02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:34.680]  and occasionally one will have a little snake underneath it.
[02:04:34.680 --> 02:04:36.440]  Someone will take a dab and it just keeps going
[02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:38.280]  and they turn red and they blow snot out of their face
[02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:39.320]  and they choke for a few minutes.
[02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:40.280]  And it's really funny to me.
[02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:41.560]  I laugh a lot.
[02:04:41.560 --> 02:04:43.120]  So that way you know which one it is.
[02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:43.960]  It's the blue one.
[02:04:43.960 --> 02:04:45.640]  If it ever happens, it's the blue one.
[02:04:45.640 --> 02:04:47.520]  I've got one blue one and the rest are silver.
[02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:48.360]  So that makes it easy for me to know.
[02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:49.600]  Now you all know the secret too.
[02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:51.440]  Yep, don't use that fucking blue one if you come over here.
[02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:54.040]  Or do, do some people like those.
[02:04:54.040 --> 02:04:54.960]  Yeah, right?
[02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:56.160]  Yeah.
[02:04:56.160 --> 02:04:58.080]  So let's see, we're talking about dab stuff.
[02:04:58.080 --> 02:04:59.760]  I've got notes, sorry.
[02:04:59.760 --> 02:05:01.880]  Let's give some dab hints.
[02:05:01.880 --> 02:05:06.240]  It's summertime and it's hot as shit here in Colorado.
[02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:08.960]  And your dabs are gonna be stuck to the parchment paper
[02:05:08.960 --> 02:05:09.800]  and hard to find.
[02:05:09.800 --> 02:05:12.840]  Okay, first of all, I saw a dispensary on Instagram today
[02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:17.120]  selling their hash in little plastic disks.
[02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:19.000]  Fuck that, step up your game, use parchment paper.
[02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:20.200]  It's cheap.
[02:05:20.200 --> 02:05:21.040]  Get some parchment paper.
[02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:22.720]  Put your dabs in parchment paper
[02:05:22.720 --> 02:05:24.400]  or one of those like silicone containers.
[02:05:24.840 --> 02:05:25.760]  Let's get away from the plastic things
[02:05:25.760 --> 02:05:27.040]  where all your dabs stick to it
[02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:28.520]  and you got to scrape it for fucking days.
[02:05:28.520 --> 02:05:30.600]  You're wasting like a quarter gram of hash in the packaging.
[02:05:30.600 --> 02:05:33.680]  No one wants to scrape out of that little plastic dish.
[02:05:33.680 --> 02:05:34.520]  Yeah, that sucks.
[02:05:34.520 --> 02:05:36.200]  The first time you go to scrape out of it,
[02:05:36.200 --> 02:05:37.800]  you realize that it's plastic
[02:05:37.800 --> 02:05:41.640]  and half the dabbers out here aren't gentle enough to,
[02:05:41.640 --> 02:05:45.120]  I mean, it quickly becomes a question of,
[02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:47.640]  am I willing to dab little strips of plastic?
[02:05:48.720 --> 02:05:49.560]  No is the answer.
[02:05:49.560 --> 02:05:50.920]  Or scrape that off my nail
[02:05:50.920 --> 02:05:53.760]  or do I just have to kiss the rest of this hash go?
[02:05:53.800 --> 02:05:55.360]  Just let it go.
[02:05:55.360 --> 02:05:57.560]  Yeah, honestly, step your packaging up a little bit.
[02:05:57.560 --> 02:05:58.800]  I'm sensitive to this.
[02:05:59.800 --> 02:06:00.760]  Nevermind.
[02:06:00.760 --> 02:06:01.760]  No, do it.
[02:06:01.760 --> 02:06:03.400]  You're a bud tender, let us have it.
[02:06:03.400 --> 02:06:04.960]  Well, like the packaging matters
[02:06:04.960 --> 02:06:07.800]  and a lot of people don't think it through to the end stage.
[02:06:07.800 --> 02:06:09.960]  They come up with the dope product.
[02:06:09.960 --> 02:06:12.040]  I mean, it's like putting a Lamborghini engine
[02:06:12.040 --> 02:06:13.480]  in a fucking Pinto sometimes.
[02:06:13.480 --> 02:06:15.120]  It's ridiculous.
[02:06:15.120 --> 02:06:17.960]  And it's got to move.
[02:06:17.960 --> 02:06:20.120]  It doesn't matter how good your product is.
[02:06:20.120 --> 02:06:23.280]  If the packaging is hideous and it's not displayable,
[02:06:23.800 --> 02:06:26.520]  it's going to annoy the people that sell it just a little.
[02:06:26.520 --> 02:06:28.360]  Even if they're annoyed just a little,
[02:06:28.360 --> 02:06:29.760]  they're going to reference the product
[02:06:29.760 --> 02:06:31.680]  that isn't annoying more.
[02:06:31.680 --> 02:06:33.520]  That's going to move 10 times faster.
[02:06:33.520 --> 02:06:34.840]  You're going to make a lot less money
[02:06:34.840 --> 02:06:36.360]  all because you didn't think your packaging
[02:06:36.360 --> 02:06:37.280]  through to the end.
[02:06:38.720 --> 02:06:40.720]  And I mean, we're watching it change in waves
[02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:41.840]  in Colorado right now.
[02:06:41.840 --> 02:06:43.640]  Every hash company had their cool,
[02:06:43.640 --> 02:06:46.320]  unique shaped logo package.
[02:06:46.320 --> 02:06:47.880]  And all of those are transitioning
[02:06:47.880 --> 02:06:50.960]  to almost identical envelopes now.
[02:06:50.960 --> 02:06:52.920]  And you guys are seeing it just as fast as I am
[02:06:53.560 --> 02:06:54.600]  up in the Springs, I'm sure.
[02:06:55.680 --> 02:06:57.520]  It matters, folks.
[02:06:57.520 --> 02:06:58.960]  Sorry to go on a little tangent,
[02:06:58.960 --> 02:07:00.600]  but the packaging matters.
[02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:04.400]  And while the original point of this was it's summer,
[02:07:04.400 --> 02:07:06.560]  the shatter's a little tacky right now.
[02:07:08.200 --> 02:07:10.520]  That's a problem when it's a plastic container.
[02:07:10.520 --> 02:07:11.440]  Yeah, use parchment.
[02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:14.440]  But where I was headed with that is air conditioner tech.
[02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:16.480]  You guys, when your shatter's getting all funky,
[02:07:16.480 --> 02:07:19.200]  go just set that shatter, put it in a baggie.
[02:07:19.200 --> 02:07:20.280]  Well, if you're not going to be in there
[02:07:20.280 --> 02:07:21.360]  for more than four or five minutes,
[02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:22.600]  you don't have to put it in a baggie.
[02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:24.120]  Just set that parchment in the freezer,
[02:07:24.120 --> 02:07:26.280]  close the door, make sure you set it in a dry area.
[02:07:26.280 --> 02:07:28.440]  Close the door, let that shit get nice and cold
[02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:29.400]  for a few minutes and pull it out.
[02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:30.920]  And now you can function with that shatter.
[02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:32.560]  It's going to be a whole lot easier to deal with.
[02:07:32.560 --> 02:07:35.240]  It's going to be real snappy, real crunchy.
[02:07:35.240 --> 02:07:36.920]  If you may be, you know,
[02:07:36.920 --> 02:07:39.040]  there's an air conditioner in places.
[02:07:39.040 --> 02:07:41.480]  You can turn on that vent and turn that fucker up,
[02:07:41.480 --> 02:07:44.200]  cool down your carb cap, cool down your dabber,
[02:07:44.200 --> 02:07:46.600]  and then you can cool down your shatter also.
[02:07:46.600 --> 02:07:48.520]  It'll make it a whole lot easier for you guys to function.
[02:07:48.520 --> 02:07:50.360]  I just honestly, I don't buy a lot of shatter
[02:07:50.360 --> 02:07:52.040]  during the summer for this exact reason.
[02:07:52.480 --> 02:07:53.560]  I just don't want to bother.
[02:07:53.560 --> 02:07:56.320]  Like if I go with a butter or a wax or a live resin,
[02:07:56.320 --> 02:07:59.840]  it's already a little tacky or soupy.
[02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:01.640]  The room temperature's not going to mess with it much.
[02:08:01.640 --> 02:08:03.960]  Ain't no season going to stop me from dabbing.
[02:08:04.880 --> 02:08:06.320]  I just dab different.
[02:08:07.400 --> 02:08:08.320]  This ain't seasonal.
[02:08:08.320 --> 02:08:10.440]  This is something I do all day, every day.
[02:08:10.440 --> 02:08:11.920]  I'm not no fair weather fan.
[02:08:11.920 --> 02:08:14.360]  Right, I just throw that extra money on Hash
[02:08:14.360 --> 02:08:15.760]  and go live resin all summer.
[02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:16.680]  It's not a bad thing.
[02:08:16.680 --> 02:08:17.600]  Have you ever been in the cold
[02:08:17.600 --> 02:08:19.480]  and where a so-called your torch wouldn't light?
[02:08:19.480 --> 02:08:20.800]  Yeah, no.
[02:08:20.840 --> 02:08:22.240]  It just goes click, click, click, and it won't light.
[02:08:22.240 --> 02:08:23.080]  I'm a smoker.
[02:08:23.080 --> 02:08:25.480]  I can make fire anywhere, sir.
[02:08:25.480 --> 02:08:26.560]  I believe you.
[02:08:26.560 --> 02:08:29.160]  I've seen your dedication to your cigarettes.
[02:08:29.160 --> 02:08:31.360]  I can make fire anywhere, guaranteed.
[02:08:31.360 --> 02:08:32.200]  Yeah.
[02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:33.880]  I wish you had been on my hike yesterday.
[02:08:33.880 --> 02:08:35.200]  Yeah.
[02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:37.760]  Well, me and hike don't happen in the same sense a lot,
[02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:40.160]  but I could teach you some things.
[02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:41.320]  Lindsay seems to be really good
[02:08:41.320 --> 02:08:43.440]  at forgetting a fire source.
[02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:47.960]  See, that's what us tumor-ridden fucks are for.
[02:08:47.960 --> 02:08:50.480]  We've always got seven bicks.
[02:08:51.160 --> 02:08:52.760]  We can find a way to get that nail hot.
[02:08:52.760 --> 02:08:53.600]  Give us a minute.
[02:08:53.600 --> 02:08:54.440]  So you should always have,
[02:08:54.440 --> 02:08:55.800]  if you're gonna be dabbing and you're on the go
[02:08:55.800 --> 02:08:56.720]  and you're going somewhere to dab,
[02:08:56.720 --> 02:08:57.920]  somebody take a can of butane.
[02:08:57.920 --> 02:09:00.280]  You have no idea how many times
[02:09:00.280 --> 02:09:02.560]  everybody's had everything we've needed to take dabs
[02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:03.560]  and nobody had any butane.
[02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:05.960]  So I'm the guy with the can of butane in my backpack.
[02:09:05.960 --> 02:09:08.240]  So I'm like, I'll treat you guys a fat dab for this butane.
[02:09:08.240 --> 02:09:09.800]  And I get the next dab that comes out of that.
[02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:11.760]  As soon as that torch is filled, guess who gets a dab?
[02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:12.600]  That would be me,
[02:09:12.600 --> 02:09:13.960]  because I had the butane to save the day.
[02:09:13.960 --> 02:09:15.720]  I don't know if it's the Boy Scout in me
[02:09:15.720 --> 02:09:17.200]  or the smoker or the stoner,
[02:09:17.200 --> 02:09:19.760]  but I've always got a couple of lighters.
[02:09:19.840 --> 02:09:21.080]  If I'm gonna go dab somewhere,
[02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:25.400]  I like a can of butane, two torches, two nails, two rigs,
[02:09:25.400 --> 02:09:29.320]  because rigs get dropped, nails get lost.
[02:09:29.320 --> 02:09:30.880]  Like also it's a weird shit happens
[02:09:30.880 --> 02:09:32.400]  and it ruins the session.
[02:09:32.400 --> 02:09:34.400]  If, oh dude, we could all be high right now,
[02:09:34.400 --> 02:09:36.640]  but we forgot a part and our weed's fancy.
[02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:37.720]  So now we're sober.
[02:09:37.720 --> 02:09:38.960]  Lindsay texted me one night.
[02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:41.520]  She's like, dude, I'm somewhere.
[02:09:41.520 --> 02:09:42.440]  I don't have a rig.
[02:09:42.440 --> 02:09:43.360]  I wanna smoke some hash.
[02:09:43.360 --> 02:09:44.600]  Did you ever rig and no torch?
[02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:45.960]  Is that, was that the story?
[02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:48.240]  I, yeah, I had a rig and I had no torch.
[02:09:48.240 --> 02:09:50.200]  So we say rig and it sounds terrible.
[02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:52.120]  By a rig, we mean a small water pipe.
[02:09:52.120 --> 02:09:52.960]  I prefer a smaller.
[02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:54.120]  I went over this on another episode,
[02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:56.800]  a small pipe with a dab nail on it.
[02:09:56.800 --> 02:09:57.960]  We go domeless nowadays.
[02:09:57.960 --> 02:09:59.480]  A lot of us use what's called a banger.
[02:09:59.480 --> 02:10:01.600]  It's a quartz hash nail.
[02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:02.440]  It looks like a little-
[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:03.320]  It's a quartz hash bucket.
[02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:04.280]  That's beautiful. It looks like a bucket.
[02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:05.280]  Yeah, it's fucking marvelous.
[02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:07.800]  But Lindsay had the pipe and the nail part,
[02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:09.880]  but she didn't have a way to make the nail part hot
[02:10:09.880 --> 02:10:11.560]  to where she could melt hash on it.
[02:10:11.560 --> 02:10:12.880]  Do you remember my advice, Linz,
[02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:15.480]  the way that I really thought would work for you?
[02:10:15.800 --> 02:10:19.760]  You gave me two that I thought were actually quite,
[02:10:20.800 --> 02:10:24.440]  so you gave me the gas stove, which, you know, had-
[02:10:24.440 --> 02:10:25.280]  Electric stove.
[02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:26.320]  Oh, sorry.
[02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:27.160]  Either way, it would have worked.
[02:10:27.160 --> 02:10:28.280]  Just a stove, use the damn stove.
[02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:30.320]  Right, and then-
[02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:32.480]  Just take the nail out and heat the nail on the stove.
[02:10:32.480 --> 02:10:33.320]  For sure, and then-
[02:10:33.320 --> 02:10:34.160]  Hot knife that.
[02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:35.000]  Or a knife and put the knife in.
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.280]  The other one was the car-
[02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:38.880]  The car cigarette lighter.
[02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:40.640]  I told her to use the car cigarette lighter
[02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:42.640]  as a carb cap on the banger.
[02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:44.920]  Like if you just heat that fucker up till it glows
[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:46.520]  and then you drop your dab in the banger
[02:10:46.520 --> 02:10:49.160]  and then put the cigarette lighter over it and draw,
[02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:51.840]  the heat would work just like how the carb cap works.
[02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:52.920]  And she didn't try it
[02:10:52.920 --> 02:10:55.040]  because she didn't have the fucking cigarette lighter.
[02:10:55.040 --> 02:10:56.640]  Mine doesn't work in my car.
[02:10:56.640 --> 02:11:00.240]  But yeah, so if you're screwed and you got a banger,
[02:11:00.240 --> 02:11:01.440]  you could probably take a dab
[02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:02.640]  by using that cigarette lighter.
[02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:04.600]  I've also, I know a little dude that-
[02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:07.600]  Well, that's what the nail and the rig is for,
[02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:10.840]  is it replaces hot knife hits in the world of hash.
[02:11:10.840 --> 02:11:13.640]  And hot knife hits is exactly what it sounds like.
[02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:15.000]  You take two butter knives,
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:18.600]  you stick them in an electric stove until the tips glow
[02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:20.320]  and then mash a piece of hash in the middle.
[02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:22.560]  That's how like everyone in Europe got stoned
[02:11:22.560 --> 02:11:24.320]  from like 71 to 75.
[02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:25.400]  Used to smoke hash like that
[02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:28.040]  in my buddy Sam's fucking kitchen years ago.
[02:11:28.040 --> 02:11:28.880]  Years and years ago.
[02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:29.720]  Shout out to Sammy.
[02:11:29.720 --> 02:11:30.560]  What's up, bro?
[02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:33.600]  When people my parents' age come into the shop
[02:11:33.600 --> 02:11:34.840]  and ask for hash,
[02:11:34.840 --> 02:11:36.960]  what they're thinking about is hot knife hits
[02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:39.840]  or the little pin under the beer mug.
[02:11:39.840 --> 02:11:41.880]  And they don't even believe that what we have now is hash.
[02:11:41.880 --> 02:11:43.000]  Like what is that shit?
[02:11:43.200 --> 02:11:46.440]  I literally explained it as this is the new fancy hash.
[02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:49.800]  Like that's my intro sentence for them.
[02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:52.280]  It's the easiest way to bring them up to speed.
[02:11:52.280 --> 02:11:55.320]  But yeah, hot knife hits work on the fancy hash too.
[02:11:55.320 --> 02:11:57.240]  It's just a little closer to crack smoking
[02:11:57.240 --> 02:11:58.760]  than most of us likes to get.
[02:11:58.760 --> 02:11:59.600]  One time I sucked,
[02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:02.400]  our buddy Kevin took his car cigarette lighter
[02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:04.040]  and took a dab and just threw the dab
[02:12:04.040 --> 02:12:05.320]  on the car cigarette lighter
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:06.920]  and inhaled what came off of it.
[02:12:09.040 --> 02:12:10.880]  It's portable and functional.
[02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:11.720]  It worked.
[02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:12.560]  Fucking worked for him.
[02:12:13.160 --> 02:12:14.440]  It's easily hidden.
[02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:17.760]  You just put it right back in there.
[02:12:17.760 --> 02:12:19.200]  It probably never worked again.
[02:12:19.200 --> 02:12:20.600]  I didn't get that far.
[02:12:20.600 --> 02:12:22.840]  One time we're at a party late one night
[02:12:22.840 --> 02:12:25.080]  and we're smoking a bowl and we had shatter.
[02:12:25.080 --> 02:12:26.440]  And this was before like,
[02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:27.600]  like Kevin and I were kind of,
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:29.320]  we were some of the first dab kids around here.
[02:12:29.320 --> 02:12:31.280]  Everyone was smoking weed at the time.
[02:12:33.760 --> 02:12:36.080]  Kevin was making shatter out of the material I was growing.
[02:12:36.080 --> 02:12:37.520]  We were kind of ahead of the curve.
[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:39.800]  So we'd go places and people would have a rig.
[02:12:39.800 --> 02:12:41.920]  And I didn't used to drive around with a rig on me.
[02:12:42.280 --> 02:12:43.280]  I wouldn't take glass with me.
[02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:44.640]  I wouldn't do any of that stuff.
[02:12:44.640 --> 02:12:47.040]  I didn't like taking a rig with me anywhere.
[02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:49.400]  But we would get a bowl burning real hot,
[02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:51.360]  just get it super ridiculous charred
[02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:53.560]  and then just drop globs of hash onto it
[02:12:53.560 --> 02:12:56.400]  and then try to smoke as much of that as we could.
[02:12:56.400 --> 02:12:58.160]  It would make us choke so hard,
[02:12:58.160 --> 02:13:00.120]  but we would get high as shit.
[02:13:00.120 --> 02:13:01.120]  It was so much fun.
[02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:02.040]  Damn.
[02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:05.120]  We did so much bizarre shit back in the day.
[02:13:06.200 --> 02:13:07.560]  The swing arm skillets,
[02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:09.360]  where we'd have them glowing like the sun
[02:13:09.360 --> 02:13:11.480]  and then throw a quarter gram dab down
[02:13:12.040 --> 02:13:13.800]  because we didn't know anything about what we were doing.
[02:13:13.800 --> 02:13:14.640]  Back in the day,
[02:13:14.640 --> 02:13:17.000]  we thought that oil would just fly out onto your legs
[02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.520]  and shit while you were hitting it boiling temp.
[02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:20.360]  Oh my God.
[02:13:21.680 --> 02:13:23.120]  Shout out to my buddy, Jordan Segoto.
[02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:25.520]  One day we were dabbing and he heated the banger
[02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:26.360]  and I don't know what he was thinking.
[02:13:26.360 --> 02:13:29.480]  He grabbed a fat dab and like just heats the banger,
[02:13:29.480 --> 02:13:32.200]  sets the torch down and just puts the dab on the nail.
[02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:34.720]  Usually you got to wait at least a few seconds.
[02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:37.080]  A lot of these new kids are setting a fucking timer.
[02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:39.120]  They got a little fucking hourglass.
[02:13:39.120 --> 02:13:40.040]  Come on, come on.
[02:13:40.040 --> 02:13:41.480]  You can wait, you know how to figure it out.
[02:13:41.480 --> 02:13:43.400]  But anyway, Jordan just goes right in.
[02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:44.280]  He just goes in.
[02:13:44.280 --> 02:13:46.640]  And I was probably 15 feet away from him
[02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:49.920]  sitting in another chair and I could hear the dab scream.
[02:13:49.920 --> 02:13:50.760]  The dab went.
[02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:54.840]  And we could all hear it from across the room.
[02:13:54.840 --> 02:13:56.640]  And that dude turned to purple and red
[02:13:56.640 --> 02:13:58.760]  and tons of different colors and coughed forever.
[02:13:58.760 --> 02:14:00.560]  That poor dude took the hottest dab ever
[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:01.400]  and I'll never forget it.
[02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:03.640]  That shit was terrible.
[02:14:03.640 --> 02:14:05.520]  Glowy, glowy.
[02:14:05.520 --> 02:14:07.480]  The first generation of dab kits
[02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:11.040]  have some of the best little burn and brand marks.
[02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:13.240]  Where's your dab wound?
[02:14:13.240 --> 02:14:16.440]  I've got two drip wounds on one of my legs
[02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:18.800]  from the skillet days that you can't really tell
[02:14:18.800 --> 02:14:20.400]  what they're, like they're dab related
[02:14:20.400 --> 02:14:23.640]  unless you get explained and then the stripe makes sense.
[02:14:24.680 --> 02:14:27.680]  But I remember seeing kids like when domeless nails
[02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:29.560]  first started being notched a little bit,
[02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:31.440]  sort of like castle towers.
[02:14:31.440 --> 02:14:32.640]  Yeah.
[02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:36.280]  I was in like Walmart or some shit
[02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:38.480]  and a kid reached out with some money
[02:14:38.480 --> 02:14:41.120]  and I saw on his forearm that he had that brand mark
[02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:44.440]  on his wrist and I was just fucking busted up laughing.
[02:14:45.560 --> 02:14:48.600]  I saw a whole bunch of the circular domeless nail burns.
[02:14:48.600 --> 02:14:50.040]  Yeah.
[02:14:50.040 --> 02:14:51.320]  Back in the dome days,
[02:14:51.320 --> 02:14:53.480]  people had all sorts of crazy drip burns.
[02:14:53.480 --> 02:14:56.920]  You guys don't let your friends try to carb the dab rig.
[02:14:56.920 --> 02:14:58.480]  Just don't pull that hot nail.
[02:14:58.480 --> 02:14:59.320]  It's hot.
[02:14:59.320 --> 02:15:00.360]  You just heated it with a torch.
[02:15:00.360 --> 02:15:01.200]  Don't carb it.
[02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:02.040]  Just smoke.
[02:15:02.040 --> 02:15:02.880]  It's not a bong.
[02:15:02.880 --> 02:15:03.700]  You're not smoking pot.
[02:15:03.700 --> 02:15:05.240]  It's not gonna burn and you're not gonna carb it.
[02:15:05.240 --> 02:15:07.480]  If you just smoke, it'll quit smoking when it's done.
[02:15:07.480 --> 02:15:08.320]  Just do it.
[02:15:08.320 --> 02:15:09.160]  You'll be cool.
[02:15:09.160 --> 02:15:11.320]  A friend of mine, he was being handed a rig
[02:15:11.320 --> 02:15:12.680]  and the person almost dropped it
[02:15:12.680 --> 02:15:15.440]  and he reached out reflexively and grabbed it
[02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:18.320]  and the heat sinks in the top of the nail lined up
[02:15:18.320 --> 02:15:20.640]  in between his thumb and forefinger
[02:15:20.640 --> 02:15:24.760]  and the brand right there looks like half space alien-y
[02:15:26.560 --> 02:15:29.760]  just because of the way that the bowl pressed into his hand
[02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:32.440]  and then the heat sinks below it, the little metal stripes.
[02:15:32.440 --> 02:15:33.280]  Jeez.
[02:15:33.280 --> 02:15:34.120]  Sounds terrible.
[02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:36.620]  The bowl was hideous, but now the brand looks cool.
[02:15:36.620 --> 02:15:37.460]  Uh.
[02:15:37.460 --> 02:15:38.280]  Okay.
[02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:39.600]  Ouch.
[02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:40.640]  There's the plus side.
[02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:41.480]  Yeah.
[02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:44.800]  All right, let's go back to a positive note, you guys.
[02:15:44.800 --> 02:15:45.640]  Man, this place is going everywhere.
[02:15:45.640 --> 02:15:47.320]  This is what dabs do to the show.
[02:15:47.320 --> 02:15:49.280]  Yeah, shout out to dabs.
[02:15:49.280 --> 02:15:51.100]  The new thing is to take some good shatter
[02:15:51.100 --> 02:15:52.600]  or some good hash of any kind
[02:15:52.600 --> 02:15:55.220]  and then dunk it into fresh terpenes,
[02:15:55.220 --> 02:15:57.680]  either from blue, blah, blah, blah.
[02:15:57.680 --> 02:15:58.960]  Words are hard at the end of the show.
[02:15:58.960 --> 02:16:01.880]  Blue river or of course our friends at Evo Labs.
[02:16:01.880 --> 02:16:02.760]  That is the thing.
[02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:04.200]  I think dunking the dabs and terps
[02:16:04.200 --> 02:16:06.320]  kind of pushes it to a whole new level.
[02:16:06.320 --> 02:16:09.200]  The ghost rain haze dabs make my eyes vibrate.
[02:16:09.200 --> 02:16:12.200]  Lemon G dabs make my head spin a little bit.
[02:16:12.200 --> 02:16:14.120]  And the OG Kush dabs just make me want to lay down
[02:16:14.120 --> 02:16:15.520]  and chill the fuck out.
[02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:16.600]  The terps, the terps.
[02:16:16.600 --> 02:16:19.000]  So these new terps are definitely the next level, you guys.
[02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.320]  If you have the opportunity, come to Colorado,
[02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:23.760]  find a store that sells terps recreationally,
[02:16:23.760 --> 02:16:25.340]  get some shatter, get some terps,
[02:16:25.340 --> 02:16:27.120]  put a dab of shatter on a dabber
[02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:28.780]  and dunk it into the container of terps.
[02:16:28.780 --> 02:16:30.960]  Put that onto a properly temperatured nail,
[02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:32.640]  carb cap it, enjoy the flavor.
[02:16:32.640 --> 02:16:33.480]  That shit's amazing.
[02:16:33.480 --> 02:16:34.320]  That's what I recommend.
[02:16:34.320 --> 02:16:35.840]  Come to Colorado, say what's up, come see us.
[02:16:35.840 --> 02:16:37.120]  It'd be awesome to see you.
[02:16:37.120 --> 02:16:37.960]  We'll take a hike with you.
[02:16:37.960 --> 02:16:39.640]  We'll take a dab with you.
[02:16:39.640 --> 02:16:40.800]  We're volunteering.
[02:16:40.800 --> 02:16:41.640]  Yeah.
[02:16:41.640 --> 02:16:42.880]  All right, you guys, we've been going for 45 minutes.
[02:16:42.880 --> 02:16:44.040]  A lot of people are getting ADD.
[02:16:44.040 --> 02:16:45.200]  The people at the table are super high
[02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:46.260]  and they're getting really quiet.
[02:16:46.260 --> 02:16:48.280]  So it feels like it's time to wrap up this show.
[02:16:48.280 --> 02:16:49.160]  Mike, you look good and high.
[02:16:49.160 --> 02:16:50.000]  What were you gonna say?
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:51.520]  I said I'm thinking about terps now.
[02:16:51.520 --> 02:16:54.440]  I was just distracted and now I remember
[02:16:54.440 --> 02:16:55.280]  those are over there.
[02:16:55.280 --> 02:16:56.560]  It's time for a dunk and dab.
[02:16:56.560 --> 02:16:58.760]  Terps, it's time for a dunk and dab nuts.
[02:16:58.760 --> 02:17:01.080]  That sounds way worse than it's gonna be.
[02:17:01.080 --> 02:17:02.960]  Mike, shout out your Twitter handle
[02:17:02.960 --> 02:17:03.920]  so that folks can follow you
[02:17:03.920 --> 02:17:05.640]  and also remind them of your Facebook page.
[02:17:05.640 --> 02:17:08.400]  It's at Nemopunk15 on Twitter
[02:17:08.400 --> 02:17:11.840]  and Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws on Facebook.
[02:17:11.840 --> 02:17:13.080]  Lindsey, that's a killer stretch.
[02:17:13.080 --> 02:17:13.920]  That's inspiring.
[02:17:13.920 --> 02:17:17.040]  You're making me wanna stretch and get an inch taller.
[02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:17.880]  Yeah.
[02:17:17.880 --> 02:17:21.760]  That was so good I couldn't even talk after.
[02:17:21.760 --> 02:17:22.600]  Yeah, I can see it.
[02:17:22.600 --> 02:17:24.640]  You had like a stroke almost.
[02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:25.920]  Remind everybody how they can follow you
[02:17:25.920 --> 02:17:27.840]  on all the social media.
[02:17:27.840 --> 02:17:32.840]  I am the Traveling Stoner on Instagram and Periscope.
[02:17:33.280 --> 02:17:37.360]  My Snapchat is Traveling Stoner without the G
[02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:41.120]  and my Twitter is the Travel Stoner.
[02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:44.200]  Oh, and Facebook is the Traveling Stoner too, I guess.
[02:17:44.200 --> 02:17:46.200]  Can you tell them about your website?
[02:17:46.200 --> 02:17:48.400]  No, cause it's not.
[02:17:48.400 --> 02:17:49.240]  Don't go there yet?
[02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:51.200]  No, it's not up and ready yet.
[02:17:51.200 --> 02:17:52.040]  Chill out on that, you guys.
[02:17:52.040 --> 02:17:52.880]  It'll be ready.
[02:17:52.880 --> 02:17:53.700]  Yeah.
[02:17:53.700 --> 02:17:54.540]  I just put her on the spot.
[02:17:54.540 --> 02:17:56.000]  Now she's gotta make it happen.
[02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:56.840]  I wanna thank you guys for coming
[02:17:56.840 --> 02:17:57.680]  and hanging out on the show.
[02:17:58.520 --> 02:17:59.360]  It's fucking midnight now.
[02:17:59.360 --> 02:18:00.180]  I know everybody has to work in the morning.
[02:18:00.180 --> 02:18:01.360]  So shout out to all the people
[02:18:01.360 --> 02:18:02.400]  that are out there busting their ass,
[02:18:02.400 --> 02:18:03.680]  all the growers, all the bud tenders,
[02:18:03.680 --> 02:18:06.400]  everybody that's making this new industry move.
[02:18:06.400 --> 02:18:08.240]  There's no room for some lazy fucks in this one.
[02:18:08.240 --> 02:18:10.320]  All the people that are on it now are grinding 100%.
[02:18:10.320 --> 02:18:12.200]  So it's time to step up and get it going.
[02:18:12.200 --> 02:18:13.040]  Yeah.
[02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:14.240]  Yeah.
[02:18:14.240 --> 02:18:16.160]  Everyone just gave me that yeah look.
[02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:17.000]  Yeah.
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.760]  I laugh at the lazy stoner stereotype.
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:24.760]  Like when you see this industry work, it's such.
[02:18:25.040 --> 02:18:25.880]  Yeah, yeah, bro.
[02:18:25.880 --> 02:18:26.720]  We put it in.
[02:18:26.720 --> 02:18:28.040]  Shout out to the people that have been trimming
[02:18:28.040 --> 02:18:29.660]  all week at the Grow.
[02:18:29.660 --> 02:18:30.700]  Much appreciated.
[02:18:30.700 --> 02:18:31.540]  All right, you guys.
[02:18:31.540 --> 02:18:33.280]  I think that is all we've got for you this week.
[02:18:33.280 --> 02:18:34.760]  Now that the show's over, I would appreciate it
[02:18:34.760 --> 02:18:36.460]  if you go to iTunes, go to the iTunes store,
[02:18:36.460 --> 02:18:37.880]  search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast,

[02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:44.320]  While you're there, you guys,
[02:18:44.320 --> 02:18:46.000]  you have the option to give me stars,
[02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:47.400]  one through five stars.
[02:18:47.400 --> 02:18:48.640]  I'm not gonna beg for five stars.
[02:18:48.640 --> 02:18:50.320]  Give me what you really feel I deserve.
[02:18:50.320 --> 02:18:52.240]  I would appreciate that.
[02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:54.320]  I would love it if you follow me on social media.
[02:18:54.320 --> 02:18:56.000]  We talked about Instagram.
[02:18:56.040 --> 02:18:56.920]  We talked about Twitter.
[02:18:56.920 --> 02:18:58.800]  We talked about Facebook.

[02:19:07.240 --> 02:19:09.720]  GrowFromYourHeart at hotmail.com.
[02:19:09.720 --> 02:19:11.920]  You guys, don't forget that the podcast is available.
[02:19:11.920 --> 02:19:14.200]  Sorry, I'm gonna cough from a dab.
[02:19:14.200 --> 02:19:15.040]  I'm not gonna do it.
[02:19:15.040 --> 02:19:15.860]  I'm gonna hold it.
[02:19:15.860 --> 02:19:16.700]  No coughs.
[02:19:16.700 --> 02:19:17.880]  Oh, coughs are for the weak.
[02:19:17.880 --> 02:19:19.640]  Don't forget the show's available on iTunes, Stitcher,
[02:19:19.640 --> 02:19:21.300]  and every single episode is archived
[02:19:21.300 --> 02:19:25.520]  on iriegeneticscolorado.com.
[02:19:26.040 --> 02:19:28.760]  I think that's all I've got for you this week, you guys.
[02:19:28.760 --> 02:19:30.880]  Coming up next time, we'll have the dab and granny.
[02:19:30.880 --> 02:19:31.720]  Not next time.
[02:19:31.720 --> 02:19:32.680]  In a future episode, we'll have the dab and granny.
[02:19:32.680 --> 02:19:34.920]  We're gonna talk about pests and issues
[02:19:34.920 --> 02:19:37.640]  and how to solve those and shit like that in the future.
[02:19:37.640 --> 02:19:38.880]  So big shout-out to my ninja spence.
[02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:40.740]  I wanna thank my friends for joining me once again.
[02:19:40.740 --> 02:19:43.000]  Until next time, take a fat dab
[02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:44.560]  and give your mom a hug for me.
[02:19:44.560 --> 02:26:03.190]  Woke up quick.
[02:26:03.190 --> 02:26:04.630]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[02:26:04.630 --> 02:26:06.470]  It's time for episode number 147
[02:26:06.470 --> 02:26:08.310]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[02:26:08.310 --> 02:26:11.950]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[02:26:11.950 --> 02:26:12.950]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[02:26:13.630 --> 02:26:14.470]  if you're a professional grower,
[02:26:14.470 --> 02:26:16.430]  if you're a news smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[02:26:16.430 --> 02:26:17.750]  if you're a cannabis activist
[02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:19.110]  or even someone who's just curious
[02:26:19.110 --> 02:26:20.870]  about the current state of cannabis,
[02:26:20.870 --> 02:26:23.030]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[02:26:23.990 --> 02:26:25.830]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[02:26:25.830 --> 02:26:27.710]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[02:26:27.710 --> 02:26:29.790]  As always, I wanna send a huge thank you shout-out
[02:26:29.790 --> 02:26:31.390]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[02:26:31.390 --> 02:26:33.830]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[02:26:33.830 --> 02:26:35.430]  Big shout-out to Kat, Koon,
[02:26:35.430 --> 02:26:37.610]  and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[02:26:39.910 --> 02:26:41.990]  Hey, guys, I'm starting this podcast off kinda bummed out.
[02:26:41.990 --> 02:26:43.150]  I'm disappointed in myself,
[02:26:43.150 --> 02:26:44.390]  I'm disappointed in technology.
[02:26:44.390 --> 02:26:45.790]  You guys, I've fucked up.
[02:26:45.790 --> 02:26:47.950]  You guys, I recorded a marvelous podcast
[02:26:47.950 --> 02:26:50.070]  with the Dabbing Granny, with Brett from Evo Labs,
[02:26:50.070 --> 02:26:53.270]  and of course, our friend, Lindsey, the Traveling Stoner.
[02:26:53.270 --> 02:26:55.550]  This evening, I pulled out my Zoom H6,
[02:26:55.550 --> 02:26:58.310]  I took out my trusty memory card, I threw it in my MacBook,
[02:26:58.310 --> 02:26:59.910]  and the files are all there.
[02:26:59.910 --> 02:27:02.150]  I can grab the files and I can move them to my MacBook,
[02:27:02.150 --> 02:27:05.090]  but for some reason, none of that shit is playable.
[02:27:05.090 --> 02:27:06.550]  So none of the material that I recorded
[02:27:06.550 --> 02:27:09.150]  with Dabbing Granny will be aired on this podcast,
[02:27:09.150 --> 02:27:11.710]  unless one of my tech-savvy friends
[02:27:12.430 --> 02:27:13.630]  is able to get this SD card
[02:27:13.630 --> 02:27:16.290]  and pull this information off of there in a usable format,
[02:27:16.290 --> 02:27:17.330]  because so far, I'm fucked.
[02:27:17.330 --> 02:27:19.470]  I tried for about an hour, all I did was frustrate myself,
[02:27:19.470 --> 02:27:21.390]  I was not able to get it going.
[02:27:21.390 --> 02:27:22.270]  So let me turn down the music
[02:27:22.270 --> 02:27:23.910]  and say this a little bit better, you guys,
[02:27:23.910 --> 02:27:26.310]  the Dabbing Granny podcast that I recorded is lost.
[02:27:26.310 --> 02:27:27.870]  It's available on her Facebook.
[02:27:27.870 --> 02:27:29.830]  We did a Facebook Live video of it,
[02:27:29.830 --> 02:27:31.790]  but I think that's the only way you're going to hear
[02:27:31.790 --> 02:27:33.790]  or see any of that episode.
[02:27:33.790 --> 02:27:36.030]  Granny, I apologize.
[02:27:36.030 --> 02:27:37.110]  Technology fucked me.
[02:27:37.110 --> 02:27:37.950]  I don't know what else to say.
[02:27:37.950 --> 02:27:39.030]  Brett, I apologize.
[02:27:39.030 --> 02:27:40.670]  Lindsey, I apologize.
[02:27:40.670 --> 02:27:43.870]  The bad news is the podcast is lost and gone
[02:27:43.870 --> 02:27:44.870]  for fucking ever.
[02:27:44.870 --> 02:27:45.830]  Technology ate it.
[02:27:45.830 --> 02:27:47.670]  Technology kicked my ass.
[02:27:47.670 --> 02:27:48.630]  You can't win every time.
[02:27:48.630 --> 02:27:51.130]  The good news, however,
[02:27:51.130 --> 02:27:53.510]  is that Dabbing Granny's got to come back to the show
[02:27:53.510 --> 02:27:55.830]  and Brett's got to come back and Lindsey has to come back
[02:27:55.830 --> 02:27:57.710]  and we have to do another podcast.
[02:27:57.710 --> 02:27:59.950]  I think I want to do a podcast with Granny by herself
[02:27:59.950 --> 02:28:00.990]  and with Brett by himself
[02:28:00.990 --> 02:28:02.790]  and then a podcast with the group together.
[02:28:02.790 --> 02:28:04.910]  I think Granny should be on the podcast kind of frequently
[02:28:04.910 --> 02:28:07.230]  because she has a lot of great shit to say.
[02:28:07.230 --> 02:28:09.390]  So I actually think Granny needs,
[02:28:09.390 --> 02:28:10.230]  she had so much to say,
[02:28:10.750 --> 02:28:11.750]  I encouraged her to start her own podcast.
[02:28:11.750 --> 02:28:13.790]  It was something that I actually said when she was here.
[02:28:13.790 --> 02:28:14.750]  So I apologize, you guys.
[02:28:14.750 --> 02:28:16.350]  I advertised that like we're going to have
[02:28:16.350 --> 02:28:17.910]  an amazing episode for you today.
[02:28:17.910 --> 02:28:19.870]  It's not going to be the episode that you expected,
[02:28:19.870 --> 02:28:22.790]  but I'm going to do my best to make it amazing.
[02:28:22.790 --> 02:28:24.910]  So everybody that was on the episode that fucked up,
[02:28:24.910 --> 02:28:26.510]  I invite you guys all to come back.
[02:28:26.510 --> 02:28:27.350]  It was a great episode.
[02:28:27.350 --> 02:28:28.390]  We hung out at the Canyon Canyon.
[02:28:28.390 --> 02:28:31.110]  We smoked so much hash that it was ridiculous.
[02:28:31.110 --> 02:28:34.510]  We had a few friends stop by, Pop D and Chosen One.
[02:28:34.510 --> 02:28:37.510]  Pop D, Glass Art and Chosen One, Glass Art showed up,
[02:28:37.510 --> 02:28:39.470]  hung out with us, took some dabs.
[02:28:39.510 --> 02:28:40.630]  Aaron hung out for a little while.
[02:28:40.630 --> 02:28:41.910]  So shout out to everybody
[02:28:41.910 --> 02:28:43.550]  that tried to make that podcast happen.
[02:28:43.550 --> 02:28:45.190]  I'm going to move forward and quit talking about that.
[02:28:45.190 --> 02:28:48.070]  Let's talk about some positive things.
[02:28:49.030 --> 02:28:49.870]  More positive stuff.
[02:28:49.870 --> 02:28:50.710]  You guys, the other night,
[02:28:50.710 --> 02:28:52.470]  I got to see Joey Coco Diaz
[02:28:52.470 --> 02:28:54.510]  at Comedy Works in downtown Denver.
[02:28:54.510 --> 02:28:56.430]  If you know anything about me, you know that I love comedy.
[02:28:56.430 --> 02:28:59.150]  You also know that I love Comedy Works in downtown Denver.
[02:28:59.150 --> 02:29:01.590]  I think that Comedy Works downtown
[02:29:01.590 --> 02:29:04.950]  is probably the best comedy club on the planet.
[02:29:04.950 --> 02:29:07.110]  If it's the second, it's the second best
[02:29:07.110 --> 02:29:09.870]  to the Comedy Store in Los Angeles, California.
[02:29:09.870 --> 02:29:10.830]  Other than that,
[02:29:10.830 --> 02:29:13.750]  Comedy Works is the best comedy club in the world.
[02:29:13.750 --> 02:29:15.630]  Now, since I'm talking about comedy,
[02:29:15.630 --> 02:29:17.990]  you guys, I saw Joey Coco Diaz.
[02:29:17.990 --> 02:29:18.910]  That is one of my,
[02:29:18.910 --> 02:29:21.110]  that might be my favorite damn comedian right now.
[02:29:21.110 --> 02:29:23.790]  That dude blew the roof off of Comedy Works, you guys.
[02:29:23.790 --> 02:29:26.150]  Joey Diaz walked out on stage and he grabbed the mic.
[02:29:26.150 --> 02:29:27.670]  Now, before he could get to the mic,
[02:29:27.670 --> 02:29:29.310]  he got a standing ovation.
[02:29:29.310 --> 02:29:32.350]  Joey walked out to a standing ovation.
[02:29:32.350 --> 02:29:33.830]  He grabbed the mic and he said,
[02:29:33.830 --> 02:29:35.870]  ah, what up, you bad motherfuckers.
[02:29:35.870 --> 02:29:37.390]  And that's just the way Joey starts the show
[02:29:37.390 --> 02:29:38.950]  and I knew it was gonna be a party from then.
[02:29:38.950 --> 02:29:41.150]  He had this little strut in his stride the whole time.
[02:29:41.150 --> 02:29:43.070]  Joey was killing it.
[02:29:43.070 --> 02:29:45.350]  The show was hosted by a comedian whose name I cannot recall.
[02:29:45.350 --> 02:29:46.190]  He was a new guy.
[02:29:46.190 --> 02:29:47.230]  He's got some dreadlocks.
[02:29:47.230 --> 02:29:49.150]  He's a very entertaining dude.
[02:29:49.150 --> 02:29:51.630]  There's another comedian whose name I cannot remember
[02:29:51.630 --> 02:29:53.390]  who was the opening act.
[02:29:53.390 --> 02:29:54.990]  Then there was a feature act whose name was Rick,
[02:29:54.990 --> 02:29:55.870]  who I've seen several times.
[02:29:55.870 --> 02:29:56.710]  He's pretty good.
[02:29:56.710 --> 02:29:57.750]  He did, see, everyone's trying to do
[02:29:57.750 --> 02:29:59.950]  a bunch of weed jokes in Colorado.
[02:29:59.950 --> 02:30:01.990]  Hey guys, if you're a comedian, an aspiring comedian,
[02:30:01.990 --> 02:30:04.070]  a touring comedian, if you're a funny guy
[02:30:04.070 --> 02:30:05.430]  and you're coming to Colorado,
[02:30:05.430 --> 02:30:06.350]  chill out on the weed jokes.
[02:30:06.350 --> 02:30:07.550]  We've heard it all.
[02:30:07.550 --> 02:30:09.630]  We've heard every fucking weed joke you're gonna tell
[02:30:09.630 --> 02:30:12.230]  unless you got some super creative weed joke.
[02:30:12.230 --> 02:30:13.550]  We've heard it.
[02:30:13.550 --> 02:30:14.470]  Trust me.
[02:30:14.470 --> 02:30:15.310]  That's for the pros.
[02:30:15.310 --> 02:30:16.150]  That's for the noobs.
[02:30:16.150 --> 02:30:17.310]  We've heard all the weed jokes.
[02:30:17.310 --> 02:30:18.310]  So the opening acts,
[02:30:18.310 --> 02:30:20.550]  they both, all three did a couple of weed jokes.
[02:30:20.550 --> 02:30:21.790]  The host did a couple of weed jokes.
[02:30:21.790 --> 02:30:22.950]  Joey barely talked about weed,
[02:30:22.950 --> 02:30:24.470]  but Joey smokes more weed than you.
[02:30:24.470 --> 02:30:26.590]  Joey eats more edibles than you.
[02:30:26.590 --> 02:30:28.750]  And Joey still is able to go on stage
[02:30:28.750 --> 02:30:30.390]  and put out an amazing fucking comedy show.
[02:30:30.390 --> 02:30:31.350]  Joey had me laughing.
[02:30:31.350 --> 02:30:32.790]  Joey Coco Diaz, you guys,
[02:30:32.790 --> 02:30:34.110]  he is the host of a podcast
[02:30:34.110 --> 02:30:35.550]  called The Church of What's Happening Now.
[02:30:35.550 --> 02:30:38.070]  He was in a movie called The Longest Yard.
[02:30:38.070 --> 02:30:39.310]  He's an amazing comedian.
[02:30:39.310 --> 02:30:40.830]  He's Joe Rogan's favorite comedian,
[02:30:40.830 --> 02:30:42.110]  if that tells you anything.
[02:30:42.110 --> 02:30:44.230]  He had me laughing so hard
[02:30:44.230 --> 02:30:46.990]  that the sides of my stomach and ribs were hurting.
[02:30:46.990 --> 02:30:48.870]  My back was hurting in a weird way.
[02:30:48.870 --> 02:30:49.990]  My cheeks hurt.
[02:30:49.990 --> 02:30:50.830]  There's a little spot,
[02:30:50.830 --> 02:30:53.310]  like right behind where my sunglasses would rest on my head.
[02:30:53.310 --> 02:30:54.150]  That shit hurt.
[02:30:54.150 --> 02:30:55.430]  It felt like someone was just squeezing my head
[02:30:55.430 --> 02:30:57.310]  and it was from laughing so hard.
[02:30:57.310 --> 02:30:58.310]  And then I told my buddy, I was like,
[02:30:58.310 --> 02:31:00.390]  I'm laughing so hard, I think I'm gonna cry.
[02:31:00.390 --> 02:31:01.950]  And I think Joey might've heard me
[02:31:01.950 --> 02:31:03.870]  because when he heard that I was gonna cry,
[02:31:03.870 --> 02:31:05.350]  I think he just started hitting harder.
[02:31:05.350 --> 02:31:07.270]  He's like, oh, you're laughing now, motherfucker.
[02:31:07.270 --> 02:31:08.470]  Watch this.
[02:31:08.470 --> 02:31:10.310]  I had tears coming out of my left eye.
[02:31:10.310 --> 02:31:12.470]  My right eye was twitching weird.
[02:31:12.470 --> 02:31:14.670]  I haven't laughed that hard in a long time.
[02:31:14.670 --> 02:31:16.070]  And I probably won't laugh that hard again
[02:31:16.070 --> 02:31:17.870]  because Joey was fucking incredible.
[02:31:17.870 --> 02:31:19.730]  He blew the roof off of Comedy Works.
[02:31:19.730 --> 02:31:21.390]  Much love to Joey Coco Diaz.
[02:31:21.390 --> 02:31:22.830]  Much love to Comedy Works.
[02:31:22.830 --> 02:31:25.910]  And also a big special thank you to my friend Baker.
[02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:28.470]  Baker, I truly appreciate what you do for me.
[02:31:28.470 --> 02:31:30.910]  I'm always treated like a VIP at Comedy Works.
[02:31:30.910 --> 02:31:31.750]  I appreciate that.
[02:31:32.550 --> 02:31:33.910]  And also shout out to my friend Buzzy
[02:31:33.910 --> 02:31:35.310]  for buying the tickets, you guys.
[02:31:35.310 --> 02:31:37.270]  I got a sweet deal with my buddy Buzzy.
[02:31:37.270 --> 02:31:39.310]  He buys tickets and I drive
[02:31:39.310 --> 02:31:40.630]  and then we go see comedy shows
[02:31:40.630 --> 02:31:42.150]  and it's fucking amazingly fun.
[02:31:42.150 --> 02:31:43.690]  So shout out to everybody involved.
[02:31:43.690 --> 02:31:44.790]  That was a great night.
[02:31:44.790 --> 02:31:46.910]  Shout out to my new friends that I made that night.
[02:31:46.910 --> 02:31:48.390]  Let's talk about other positive things
[02:31:48.390 --> 02:31:49.390]  that happened in my life.
[02:31:49.390 --> 02:31:51.270]  Last night, you guys, I got to see
[02:31:51.270 --> 02:31:52.910]  one of my favorite bands,
[02:31:52.910 --> 02:31:55.590]  Joseph Israel and the Jerusalem Band.
[02:31:55.590 --> 02:31:58.590]  They were in my hometown of Pueblo, Colorado.
[02:31:58.590 --> 02:32:00.350]  They were 10 minutes away from my house
[02:32:00.390 --> 02:32:02.070]  at the Brews Ale House.
[02:32:02.070 --> 02:32:03.190]  All I had to do was drive over there,
[02:32:03.190 --> 02:32:06.310]  find parking, march on in and get my reggae on.
[02:32:06.310 --> 02:32:08.310]  It was local, it was amazing.
[02:32:08.310 --> 02:32:09.590]  Shout out to the Brews Ale House.
[02:32:09.590 --> 02:32:10.490]  That club is great.
[02:32:10.490 --> 02:32:15.490]  It's probably the best venue in Pueblo right now.
[02:32:15.710 --> 02:32:17.110]  There are a couple theaters they compete,
[02:32:17.110 --> 02:32:18.150]  but I'm gonna give that place
[02:32:18.150 --> 02:32:20.110]  the number one venue for the vibe.
[02:32:20.110 --> 02:32:21.390]  They got a backdoor that rolls up.
[02:32:21.390 --> 02:32:22.390]  You're right on the river walk.
[02:32:22.390 --> 02:32:24.470]  You can see the river right behind you.
[02:32:24.470 --> 02:32:25.630]  The sound is good in there.
[02:32:25.630 --> 02:32:26.470]  The vibe is good.
[02:32:26.470 --> 02:32:27.870]  It was a great place.
[02:32:27.910 --> 02:32:29.350]  The band, oh my goodness,
[02:32:29.350 --> 02:32:32.870]  Joseph Israel and the band tore it up.
[02:32:32.870 --> 02:32:34.710]  You guys, I've been seeing Joseph Israel for probably,
[02:32:34.710 --> 02:32:37.510]  I've been watching his band for probably 10 years.
[02:32:37.510 --> 02:32:39.710]  This was, I've seen several of their shows.
[02:32:39.710 --> 02:32:43.470]  I've seen this band progress and come a long, long way.
[02:32:43.470 --> 02:32:44.930]  And last night's show was the best show
[02:32:44.930 --> 02:32:46.190]  that I've ever seen them do.
[02:32:46.190 --> 02:32:48.430]  It was the second to last show on their tour.
[02:32:48.430 --> 02:32:49.770]  And you could tell that they just played
[02:32:49.770 --> 02:32:50.710]  until they were done.
[02:32:50.710 --> 02:32:52.350]  Tonight's show, they're not gonna have a lot of energy
[02:32:52.350 --> 02:32:53.870]  because they wore themselves out last night.
[02:32:53.870 --> 02:32:55.150]  Whoever sees them tonight, I'm sorry.
[02:32:55.150 --> 02:32:57.210]  I drained all their energy.
[02:32:57.250 --> 02:32:58.890]  My favorite album from Joseph Israel
[02:32:58.890 --> 02:33:00.410]  is an album called Gone Are The Days.
[02:33:00.410 --> 02:33:02.610]  I think it was his original release.
[02:33:02.610 --> 02:33:04.850]  They played, there were probably 15 songs on there.
[02:33:04.850 --> 02:33:06.610]  I think a couple of them are like dub remixes.
[02:33:06.610 --> 02:33:08.130]  So there's like probably 10 songs on there.
[02:33:08.130 --> 02:33:10.210]  They must've played seven or eight of them.
[02:33:10.210 --> 02:33:11.890]  And they played all my favorites.
[02:33:11.890 --> 02:33:14.050]  I could yell out a song and they would play it for me.
[02:33:14.050 --> 02:33:15.970]  They weren't gonna play a song called Truth,
[02:33:15.970 --> 02:33:17.250]  but Truth is one of my favorites.
[02:33:17.250 --> 02:33:18.290]  And there was a break.
[02:33:18.290 --> 02:33:20.050]  You know when the musicians are like tuning their guitars
[02:33:20.050 --> 02:33:22.270]  and they're all talking and taking a drink?
[02:33:22.270 --> 02:33:24.410]  I yelled out Truth and I was like right in the front row.
[02:33:24.410 --> 02:33:26.570]  So Joseph looked at me like, oh yeah?
[02:33:26.970 --> 02:33:28.410]  They talked about it for a minute and they said,
[02:33:28.410 --> 02:33:29.470]  we haven't played this.
[02:33:29.470 --> 02:33:30.330]  We don't practice this.
[02:33:30.330 --> 02:33:32.410]  We haven't played this since we recorded
[02:33:32.410 --> 02:33:34.210]  the Gone Are The Days album.
[02:33:34.210 --> 02:33:35.830]  And they started singing the chorus.
[02:33:35.830 --> 02:33:37.250]  They just started doing like a really cool
[02:33:37.250 --> 02:33:39.850]  acapella harmony version of the chorus.
[02:33:39.850 --> 02:33:41.950]  And then once that chorus ended,
[02:33:41.950 --> 02:33:44.090]  the guitar player started playing the guitar lick
[02:33:44.090 --> 02:33:46.850]  and they played the song Truth for me.
[02:33:46.850 --> 02:33:48.370]  It wasn't tight and it wasn't perfect,
[02:33:48.370 --> 02:33:49.330]  but you know what, it was beautiful
[02:33:49.330 --> 02:33:51.990]  that my friends tried to play that song for me.
[02:33:51.990 --> 02:33:55.170]  So much love to Joseph Israel and the Jerusalem Band
[02:33:55.170 --> 02:33:56.770]  and the entire crew at Bruze Alehouse.
[02:33:56.770 --> 02:33:58.290]  I had an amazing time.
[02:33:58.290 --> 02:34:01.890]  I got to smoke after the show with a couple of the guys.
[02:34:01.890 --> 02:34:03.370]  Something I should mention,
[02:34:03.370 --> 02:34:05.530]  I have been a huge fan of a bass player
[02:34:05.530 --> 02:34:07.250]  by the name of Chris Meredith.
[02:34:07.250 --> 02:34:09.730]  He plays with Joseph Israel and the Jerusalem Band,
[02:34:09.730 --> 02:34:12.490]  but he's also known as a recording artist in Jamaica.
[02:34:12.490 --> 02:34:15.730]  And he's also well known for playing with Stephen Marley.
[02:34:15.730 --> 02:34:18.090]  I walked into the building and Chris Meredith
[02:34:18.090 --> 02:34:20.630]  was just standing there talking to Joseph Israel.
[02:34:20.630 --> 02:34:22.730]  And I realized he was going to be the bass player
[02:34:22.730 --> 02:34:24.010]  for the show that night.
[02:34:24.010 --> 02:34:25.490]  That put a huge smile on my face
[02:34:25.490 --> 02:34:27.610]  because he recorded Joseph's album with him.
[02:34:27.610 --> 02:34:29.010]  He went on tour for the first tour
[02:34:29.010 --> 02:34:30.250]  and then he had to go back to Jamaica
[02:34:30.250 --> 02:34:31.650]  and he took off for a little while.
[02:34:31.650 --> 02:34:33.450]  So we didn't see him on tour with Joseph.
[02:34:33.450 --> 02:34:35.450]  It was great to see Chris and the original drummer
[02:34:35.450 --> 02:34:37.410]  back together in the rhythm section.
[02:34:37.410 --> 02:34:40.130]  I actually got to meet the original keyboard player
[02:34:40.130 --> 02:34:41.350]  from the Gone Are The Days album.
[02:34:41.350 --> 02:34:42.570]  We got to talk about the recording.
[02:34:42.570 --> 02:34:44.250]  We got to talk about a few things.
[02:34:44.250 --> 02:34:46.970]  Got to talk about the Tough Gong Recording Studio in Jamaica.
[02:34:46.970 --> 02:34:49.050]  It was really nice to hang out with some Jamaican Rastas,
[02:34:49.050 --> 02:34:52.070]  some faithful folks, folks with good vibes,
[02:34:52.070 --> 02:34:55.190]  folks with positive energy, with good things to say.
[02:34:55.190 --> 02:34:57.790]  You guys, I recommend that you listen to Joseph Israel
[02:34:57.790 --> 02:34:58.630]  and the Jerusalem Band.
[02:34:58.630 --> 02:34:59.910]  I just talked about him for like five minutes.
[02:34:59.910 --> 02:35:00.790]  So we're going to move on from that.
[02:35:00.790 --> 02:35:03.150]  But big shout out, much love, much respect,
[02:35:03.150 --> 02:35:04.670]  much good vibes from Joseph Israel
[02:35:04.670 --> 02:35:06.150]  and the Jerusalem Band last night.
[02:35:06.150 --> 02:35:06.990]  I had a great time.
[02:35:06.990 --> 02:35:08.430]  Shout out to the friend that went with me.
[02:35:08.430 --> 02:35:09.710]  I had fun dancing.
[02:35:09.710 --> 02:35:12.750]  We got to laugh at some crazy drunk people.
[02:35:12.750 --> 02:35:15.130]  Man, drunk people are super entertaining.
[02:35:15.130 --> 02:35:17.390]  I am so glad I do not consume alcohol anymore.
[02:35:17.390 --> 02:35:19.350]  I just smoke mad cannabis.
[02:35:19.350 --> 02:35:20.630]  There may have been a little smoke session
[02:35:20.630 --> 02:35:21.990]  in the back of the club at the end of the night.
[02:35:22.910 --> 02:35:23.750]  But that was a good time.
[02:35:23.750 --> 02:35:24.590]  Shout out to everybody.
[02:35:24.590 --> 02:35:26.390]  All right, let's move on to some grow knowledge, you guys.
[02:35:26.390 --> 02:35:29.050]  Been talking about my weekend and my week long enough.
[02:35:29.050 --> 02:35:30.750]  Let's talk about grow knowledge.
[02:35:30.750 --> 02:35:33.790]  A few episodes back, I was asked how to handle grasshoppers.
[02:35:33.790 --> 02:35:36.550]  And what I've noticed is everybody is getting bombarded
[02:35:36.550 --> 02:35:39.370]  with grasshoppers and their outdoor cannabis grow this year.
[02:35:39.370 --> 02:35:40.830]  The number one way that you can get rid
[02:35:40.830 --> 02:35:42.630]  of your grasshoppers is just to clean up.
[02:35:42.630 --> 02:35:44.710]  If you can mow all the grass, mow all the weeds,
[02:35:44.710 --> 02:35:46.150]  get rid of anywhere for them to live,
[02:35:46.150 --> 02:35:47.570]  get rid of all the stuff for them to eat,
[02:35:47.570 --> 02:35:49.590]  the grasshoppers won't want to come around.
[02:35:49.590 --> 02:35:51.030]  I understand that your neighbors
[02:35:51.030 --> 02:35:53.230]  probably have a big ass pile of grass
[02:35:53.230 --> 02:35:54.350]  and leaves and shit in their yard
[02:35:54.350 --> 02:35:55.730]  that you cannot do anything about.
[02:35:55.730 --> 02:35:57.150]  It's illegal to go over there with a torch
[02:35:57.150 --> 02:35:58.750]  and just burn that shit down.
[02:35:58.750 --> 02:36:01.150]  So if you're having problems with grasshoppers,
[02:36:01.150 --> 02:36:03.390]  somebody recommended to me garlic
[02:36:03.390 --> 02:36:06.870]  and fermented garlic sprays to help keep grasshoppers
[02:36:06.870 --> 02:36:07.750]  and other pests away.
[02:36:07.750 --> 02:36:10.250]  I assume that this would work on most insects
[02:36:10.250 --> 02:36:11.370]  and most living creatures.
[02:36:11.370 --> 02:36:15.310]  If you ferment some garlic or mush garlic up into a spray
[02:36:15.310 --> 02:36:17.250]  and spray that around your plants on
[02:36:17.250 --> 02:36:18.390]  and or around your plants
[02:36:18.390 --> 02:36:19.590]  and on the perimeter of your plants,
[02:36:19.590 --> 02:36:21.910]  most bugs are going to stay away from that.
[02:36:21.910 --> 02:36:24.270]  And definitely you will not have any vampires.
[02:36:24.270 --> 02:36:26.030]  So if you're worried about vampires in the garden,
[02:36:26.030 --> 02:36:27.910]  you could double up on the garlic spray.
[02:36:27.910 --> 02:36:29.050]  You'll be just fine.
[02:36:29.050 --> 02:36:30.610]  So shout out to the person that told me
[02:36:30.610 --> 02:36:32.330]  about fermented garlic sprays
[02:36:32.330 --> 02:36:33.450]  and using them in my garden
[02:36:33.450 --> 02:36:36.350]  to keep away grasshoppers outdoors.
[02:36:36.350 --> 02:36:38.270]  Because I don't grow outdoors myself very much,
[02:36:38.270 --> 02:36:39.310]  but a lot of our friends do.
[02:36:39.310 --> 02:36:41.670]  And I think in the next episode may feature our buddy,
[02:36:41.670 --> 02:36:43.790]  Jesse, and we're going to talk about some outdoor stuff.
[02:36:43.790 --> 02:36:44.630]  Shout out to Jesse.
[02:36:44.630 --> 02:36:45.630]  If you're listening to this, call me dude.
[02:36:45.630 --> 02:36:47.870]  Let's plan this episode so we can get it recorded.
[02:36:47.870 --> 02:36:49.250]  We'll record it at my house.
[02:36:49.910 --> 02:36:50.750]  We won't use my computer.
[02:36:50.750 --> 02:36:52.890]  We won't use the Zoom H6 because I'm paranoid of that thing.
[02:36:52.890 --> 02:36:53.850]  I'm afraid it's going to break
[02:36:53.850 --> 02:36:55.210]  and not record the damn show again.
[02:36:55.210 --> 02:36:56.890]  So probably won't do that.
[02:36:56.890 --> 02:36:58.610]  Ah, grasshoppers.
[02:36:58.610 --> 02:36:59.490]  Yes, emails.
[02:36:59.490 --> 02:37:00.910]  I've got some emails here in my phone.
[02:37:00.910 --> 02:37:01.990]  People have asked some questions.
[02:37:01.990 --> 02:37:04.050]  You guys ask great questions.
[02:37:04.050 --> 02:37:05.090]  I want to give a shout out to everybody
[02:37:05.090 --> 02:37:06.250]  that sends me an email.
[02:37:06.250 --> 02:37:08.570]  I'm going to try to read all of the questions over time
[02:37:08.570 --> 02:37:10.310]  on the air, but I'm a little bit backed up.
[02:37:10.310 --> 02:37:12.450]  So I'm going to have to record more episodes.
[02:37:12.450 --> 02:37:15.090]  Anyway, here's an email that came from,
[02:37:15.090 --> 02:37:16.210]  let's see, how did he sign it?
[02:37:16.210 --> 02:37:18.050]  He signed it Mazar420.
[02:37:18.050 --> 02:37:20.130]  So shout out to Mazar420.
[02:37:20.130 --> 02:37:20.970]  His email says,
[02:37:20.970 --> 02:37:22.930]  hoping you can read my questions on the show.
[02:37:22.930 --> 02:37:23.770]  Been loving the show.
[02:37:23.770 --> 02:37:25.330]  Helps me get through my day
[02:37:25.330 --> 02:37:27.690]  at a mind numbing job with robots.
[02:37:27.690 --> 02:37:30.010]  Do you work with robots or just like people
[02:37:30.010 --> 02:37:31.810]  who are unaware and people who are programmed
[02:37:31.810 --> 02:37:32.650]  to act like robots?
[02:37:32.650 --> 02:37:33.470]  I'm curious.
[02:37:33.470 --> 02:37:34.890]  Anyway, he said, questions for the show.
[02:37:34.890 --> 02:37:38.610]  When you flip to 1212 or 1113 DJ short style,
[02:37:38.610 --> 02:37:42.610]  how long till you want to go from metal halide to HPS?
[02:37:42.610 --> 02:37:44.370]  Now I want to talk about this 1212
[02:37:44.370 --> 02:37:47.210]  or 1113 DJ short style thing.
[02:37:47.330 --> 02:37:50.490]  What Mazar420 is asking is when I change my light cycle
[02:37:50.490 --> 02:37:53.570]  from my vegetative stage, either 24 hours on
[02:37:53.570 --> 02:37:56.690]  or an 18 six cycle, or maybe a 16 eight,
[02:37:56.690 --> 02:37:57.810]  depends on where you are.
[02:37:57.810 --> 02:38:00.450]  When I change my light cycle to my flowering phase,
[02:38:00.450 --> 02:38:02.730]  which would normally be 1212,
[02:38:02.730 --> 02:38:05.890]  or he says the 1113 DJ short style.
[02:38:05.890 --> 02:38:07.650]  Let me talk about that for a minute.
[02:38:07.650 --> 02:38:09.690]  DJ short is a well-known breeder.
[02:38:09.690 --> 02:38:10.890]  He's a great speaker.
[02:38:10.890 --> 02:38:12.890]  He is an author, he is well-educated
[02:38:12.890 --> 02:38:15.370]  and very passionate about the cannabis plant.
[02:38:15.370 --> 02:38:17.170]  DJ short breeds amazing strains.
[02:38:18.010 --> 02:38:18.850]  He is known for the blueberry.
[02:38:18.850 --> 02:38:20.210]  DJ short bred the flow.
[02:38:20.210 --> 02:38:22.130]  So there's something in DJ short's catalog
[02:38:22.130 --> 02:38:24.090]  that you have smoked and you have enjoyed
[02:38:24.090 --> 02:38:25.370]  that came from old DJ.
[02:38:26.610 --> 02:38:29.610]  Now DJ does a trick when he's flowering his plants,
[02:38:29.610 --> 02:38:32.370]  he does not run them for 12 on 12 off.
[02:38:32.370 --> 02:38:36.110]  He does 11 hours on and 13 hours off.
[02:38:37.450 --> 02:38:42.450]  His theory on this is that you will see broader variants
[02:38:42.810 --> 02:38:45.650]  in phenotypical expression from your plants.
[02:38:45.650 --> 02:38:48.130]  So if you're a breeder and you're looking for phenotypes,
[02:38:48.130 --> 02:38:51.330]  this extra hour really lets the plants express themselves
[02:38:51.330 --> 02:38:53.930]  and show the variation and show their potential.
[02:38:53.930 --> 02:38:56.490]  It also will save you one hour of electricity
[02:38:56.490 --> 02:39:01.170]  over a 65 day cycle, which is gonna be 65 hours,
[02:39:01.170 --> 02:39:04.170]  kilowatt hours that you're not spending on your lights.
[02:39:04.170 --> 02:39:05.810]  It's also gonna be an hour resting off
[02:39:05.810 --> 02:39:07.370]  of your air conditioning.
[02:39:07.370 --> 02:39:08.730]  It's also going to,
[02:39:08.730 --> 02:39:10.970]  some people think it increases their yields.
[02:39:10.970 --> 02:39:12.130]  I tried it.
[02:39:12.130 --> 02:39:14.130]  I didn't like what it did to some of my plants.
[02:39:14.330 --> 02:39:16.370]  I did like what it did to some of my plants.
[02:39:16.370 --> 02:39:17.930]  So it's very plant specific.
[02:39:17.930 --> 02:39:19.150]  It's strain specific.
[02:39:19.150 --> 02:39:20.910]  It may be phenotype specific.
[02:39:20.910 --> 02:39:23.250]  I have not experimented enough to know,
[02:39:23.250 --> 02:39:24.730]  but a lot of people in the community
[02:39:24.730 --> 02:39:27.070]  are switching to the 1113 method.
[02:39:27.070 --> 02:39:28.910]  It saves money, it saves time.
[02:39:28.910 --> 02:39:31.570]  And if you've got the right varietals, it will work for you.
[02:39:31.570 --> 02:39:32.490]  One thing I've noticed,
[02:39:32.490 --> 02:39:34.930]  some of my heavier sativas didn't like it in the beginning.
[02:39:34.930 --> 02:39:36.770]  It took them a while to get used to it.
[02:39:36.770 --> 02:39:38.450]  I liked my sativas on 12, 12,
[02:39:38.450 --> 02:39:40.330]  and then toward the end of the phase,
[02:39:40.330 --> 02:39:42.490]  that's when I would start dropping down the timers.
[02:39:42.490 --> 02:39:43.650]  They didn't seem to really like it
[02:39:43.650 --> 02:39:46.930]  when I went 13 hours of darkness right away.
[02:39:46.930 --> 02:39:51.270]  So that catches us up to speed on the DJ Short 1113 method.
[02:39:51.270 --> 02:39:54.090]  Now he says, how long, once you do this flip,
[02:39:54.090 --> 02:39:56.390]  do you want to go from metal halide to HPS?
[02:39:56.390 --> 02:39:58.290]  That's his first part of his question.
[02:39:58.290 --> 02:40:00.590]  Generally, I let it go 10 to 14 days,
[02:40:00.590 --> 02:40:01.850]  rocking the metal halide.
[02:40:01.850 --> 02:40:03.690]  When I see the buds starting to form,
[02:40:03.690 --> 02:40:05.650]  when I see those little pre buds and the pre flowers
[02:40:05.650 --> 02:40:06.530]  just starting to pop up
[02:40:06.530 --> 02:40:08.110]  and they're getting a little dandelions,
[02:40:08.110 --> 02:40:10.370]  that's usually when I switch in that bulb.
[02:40:10.370 --> 02:40:14.290]  If you really want to go crazy, do it three weeks,
[02:40:14.290 --> 02:40:15.770]  because I think when you flip,
[02:40:15.770 --> 02:40:17.930]  those plants are going to stretch for about three weeks.
[02:40:17.930 --> 02:40:19.930]  And keeping that halide bulb in there,
[02:40:19.930 --> 02:40:22.850]  really I think helps prevent them from stretching so much.
[02:40:22.850 --> 02:40:25.090]  So keep that halide in there for 10 to 14 days.
[02:40:25.090 --> 02:40:27.690]  If you want to go extreme, go 21 days,
[02:40:27.690 --> 02:40:29.970]  but you may slow down bud development at that point.
[02:40:29.970 --> 02:40:32.390]  I like to switch it in there about that 14th day,
[02:40:32.390 --> 02:40:34.770]  because that's when my buds are going to start happening.
[02:40:34.770 --> 02:40:36.830]  One thing that you can utilize that I've done
[02:40:36.830 --> 02:40:40.090]  and had great success with is mix and match spectrums.
[02:40:40.770 --> 02:40:41.610]  You can use a little bit of metal halide
[02:40:41.610 --> 02:40:43.890]  and use a little bit of HPS if you can.
[02:40:43.890 --> 02:40:47.410]  So I've got a reflector, it's called the Grozilla,
[02:40:47.410 --> 02:40:48.330]  and I haven't used it in a long time.
[02:40:48.330 --> 02:40:50.050]  I should fire it up and do some experiments with it
[02:40:50.050 --> 02:40:51.050]  just for fun.
[02:40:51.050 --> 02:40:53.490]  But this reflector holds two bulbs
[02:40:53.490 --> 02:40:56.130]  and they say not to put more than a thousand watt total
[02:40:56.130 --> 02:40:57.730]  in there, it may say 1200 total.
[02:40:57.730 --> 02:41:00.650]  So you could put two 600 bulbs in this one reflector.
[02:41:00.650 --> 02:41:04.090]  What I did, I put a 600 watt high pressure sodium
[02:41:04.090 --> 02:41:06.010]  and a 400 watt metal halide in there
[02:41:06.010 --> 02:41:09.170]  and hung that bulb in a five by five hydro hut.
[02:41:09.170 --> 02:41:11.970]  And I put nine three gallon pots under there.
[02:41:11.970 --> 02:41:15.410]  And honestly, I grew some of the most photogenic
[02:41:15.410 --> 02:41:17.610]  and most aromatic, most flavorful
[02:41:17.610 --> 02:41:19.690]  and most potent cannabis I've ever grown.
[02:41:19.690 --> 02:41:21.210]  Came from that five by five hut
[02:41:21.210 --> 02:41:22.810]  with that mixed spectrum light.
[02:41:22.810 --> 02:41:25.010]  It was some very impressive cannabis.
[02:41:25.010 --> 02:41:27.030]  The only problem was it didn't harvest
[02:41:27.030 --> 02:41:28.970]  what I wished it would have.
[02:41:28.970 --> 02:41:31.690]  When I use a thousand watt HPS in one of those huts
[02:41:31.690 --> 02:41:33.970]  with proper ducting and venting and air conditioning,
[02:41:33.970 --> 02:41:36.810]  I can pull a pound and a half, really close to two pounds.
[02:41:36.810 --> 02:41:38.090]  It's hard to hit two pounds in those huts
[02:41:38.090 --> 02:41:39.930]  because you're really limited on height and space.
[02:41:39.930 --> 02:41:41.330]  So you gotta like top them out
[02:41:41.330 --> 02:41:42.930]  and pull them out real far and train them.
[02:41:42.930 --> 02:41:45.130]  You can get a pound and a half out of one of those huts.
[02:41:45.130 --> 02:41:48.290]  When I did the HPS metal halide combo,
[02:41:48.290 --> 02:41:50.370]  I got right about a pound and a quarter.
[02:41:50.370 --> 02:41:52.610]  So it didn't do what I would expect.
[02:41:52.610 --> 02:41:55.130]  I think that 600 watt light kind of didn't let it push,
[02:41:55.130 --> 02:41:58.330]  but the flavor and the aroma and the potency made up
[02:41:58.330 --> 02:42:00.090]  for the lack of weight, because it was for me.
[02:42:00.090 --> 02:42:01.450]  I was growing it for my own head stash.
[02:42:01.450 --> 02:42:03.250]  So I didn't need a whole bunch.
[02:42:03.250 --> 02:42:04.970]  All right, so that's the first part of your question.
[02:42:04.970 --> 02:42:07.810]  I would do it somewhere between 14 and 21 days,
[02:42:08.490 --> 02:42:09.330]  10 days if you're trying to go early,
[02:42:09.330 --> 02:42:10.290]  14 days is about ideal,
[02:42:10.290 --> 02:42:12.690]  21 days if you're really trying to keep those plants short,
[02:42:12.690 --> 02:42:15.450]  because that halide lamp is going to keep them
[02:42:15.450 --> 02:42:17.770]  from stretching on you, is part of why we do that.
[02:42:17.770 --> 02:42:20.170]  So he also says, also was wondering,
[02:42:20.170 --> 02:42:21.730]  how long once under 1212,
[02:42:21.730 --> 02:42:24.810]  do you wait to switch your nutrients from veg to bloom?
[02:42:25.650 --> 02:42:27.010]  Then he also says, hope to hear my questions
[02:42:27.010 --> 02:42:27.890]  get answered on the show.
[02:42:27.890 --> 02:42:29.770]  Sincerely, Mazzer420.
[02:42:29.770 --> 02:42:33.330]  So he's wondering, how long from the day we switched to 1212
[02:42:33.330 --> 02:42:36.330]  do we wait to switch our nutrients from veg to bloom?
[02:42:36.330 --> 02:42:38.130]  I kind of do a slow transition.
[02:42:38.130 --> 02:42:41.650]  I believe that your plant is going to absorb
[02:42:41.650 --> 02:42:45.090]  somewhere between 80 and 90% of its nitrogen
[02:42:45.090 --> 02:42:47.490]  that all of it's going to absorb through its whole life.
[02:42:47.490 --> 02:42:48.730]  It's going to absorb most of that
[02:42:48.730 --> 02:42:49.950]  through the vegetative stage.
[02:42:49.950 --> 02:42:50.970]  Once you hit flowering,
[02:42:50.970 --> 02:42:52.890]  once you get to that second or third week of flowering,
[02:42:52.890 --> 02:42:54.610]  you're not going to use a whole lot of nitrogen,
[02:42:54.610 --> 02:42:56.530]  just enough to keep the leaves green
[02:42:56.530 --> 02:42:57.970]  and keep the plant moving.
[02:42:57.970 --> 02:42:59.530]  So nitrogen is going to kind of fizzle out.
[02:42:59.530 --> 02:43:03.410]  So you can switch the nutrients right away if you'd like to,
[02:43:03.410 --> 02:43:06.250]  or you can keep those nutrients going slowly
[02:43:07.170 --> 02:43:09.970]  so if you've got grow and you've got bloom,
[02:43:09.970 --> 02:43:12.290]  maybe go seven to 10 days with that grow
[02:43:12.290 --> 02:43:15.730]  before you pull out the grow nutrient and throw in the bloom
[02:43:15.730 --> 02:43:16.930]  or you can just switch right away.
[02:43:16.930 --> 02:43:17.770]  It's up to you.
[02:43:17.770 --> 02:43:19.330]  It kind of depends on the strains.
[02:43:19.330 --> 02:43:23.090]  Also, Gorilla Glue really likes to eat.
[02:43:23.090 --> 02:43:25.050]  So I kind of stick with my veg nutrients
[02:43:25.050 --> 02:43:28.010]  for an extra week or two with the Gorilla Glue.
[02:43:28.010 --> 02:43:29.290]  Things like Flow.
[02:43:29.290 --> 02:43:30.770]  Flow doesn't require a lot of food.
[02:43:30.770 --> 02:43:32.530]  Flow will just grow like a son of a bitch.
[02:43:32.530 --> 02:43:34.570]  So I'll switch Flow right away.
[02:43:34.570 --> 02:43:36.130]  When I go 1212, that day,
[02:43:36.170 --> 02:43:37.650]  they get fed their bloom nutrients.
[02:43:37.650 --> 02:43:38.690]  They start getting...
[02:43:38.690 --> 02:43:40.690]  Basically, your first day of bloom nutrients
[02:43:40.690 --> 02:43:45.410]  aren't very far off from your last week of veg nutrients.
[02:43:45.410 --> 02:43:47.730]  So it shouldn't be too abrupt of a switch either way.
[02:43:47.730 --> 02:43:50.410]  But somewhere between that first day
[02:43:50.410 --> 02:43:51.890]  and about seven to 10 days in
[02:43:51.890 --> 02:43:53.290]  is when I will totally have switched
[02:43:53.290 --> 02:43:54.490]  from veg to bloom nutrients.
[02:43:54.490 --> 02:43:55.450]  It kind of depends on the plant.
[02:43:55.450 --> 02:43:57.250]  It kind of depends on what I'm doing.
[02:43:57.250 --> 02:43:59.410]  It kind of depends on the room, the strain,
[02:43:59.410 --> 02:44:00.730]  the brand of nutrients.
[02:44:00.730 --> 02:44:02.530]  If I'm using Botanicare Bottled Nudes,
[02:44:02.530 --> 02:44:05.690]  my switch from my veg stage to my flower phase,
[02:44:05.690 --> 02:44:07.650]  like I said, is not very different.
[02:44:07.650 --> 02:44:08.610]  It's a base nutrient.
[02:44:08.610 --> 02:44:10.170]  It's cow mag, liquid karma,
[02:44:10.170 --> 02:44:11.610]  and maybe a little bit of...
[02:44:11.610 --> 02:44:13.090]  What else am I using in there?
[02:44:13.090 --> 02:44:13.970]  Potassium silicates.
[02:44:13.970 --> 02:44:15.690]  There wouldn't be a whole lot else.
[02:44:15.690 --> 02:44:17.090]  Oh, there's a dog resting on my feet.
[02:44:17.090 --> 02:44:18.370]  I just moved my foot and kicked him right in the head.
[02:44:18.370 --> 02:44:19.210]  I'm sorry, puppy.
[02:44:19.210 --> 02:44:20.210]  I didn't mean to do that, boy.
[02:44:20.210 --> 02:44:21.050]  I'm sorry.
[02:44:21.050 --> 02:44:21.890]  I apologize.
[02:44:21.890 --> 02:44:22.810]  Big shout out to Mick the dog, you guys.
[02:44:22.810 --> 02:44:24.450]  Mick the dog's been hanging out with me for a couple days.
[02:44:24.450 --> 02:44:25.410]  He's a cool ass dog.
[02:44:25.410 --> 02:44:26.850]  You guys would like him.
[02:44:26.850 --> 02:44:27.970]  Sorry, I just kicked you right in the head, boy.
[02:44:27.970 --> 02:44:29.210]  I feel bad.
[02:44:29.210 --> 02:44:30.690]  Everyone on the show hears me apologizing.
[02:44:30.690 --> 02:44:31.530]  I won't do it again, buddy.
[02:44:31.530 --> 02:44:32.370]  I'll pet you.
[02:44:32.410 --> 02:44:34.410]  So yeah, my veg nudes.
[02:44:34.410 --> 02:44:36.130]  There'll be some, what did I say?
[02:44:36.130 --> 02:44:36.970]  Base nutrients,
[02:44:36.970 --> 02:44:40.090]  which would be the Botanicare Pure Blend Pro Grow.
[02:44:40.090 --> 02:44:41.490]  And then you've got some cow mag in there,
[02:44:41.490 --> 02:44:42.650]  maybe a little bit of liquid karma
[02:44:42.650 --> 02:44:44.210]  and then some potassium silicates.
[02:44:44.210 --> 02:44:45.650]  That's basically my veg mix.
[02:44:45.650 --> 02:44:48.210]  I would add something in there for roots,
[02:44:48.210 --> 02:44:49.490]  some sort of root inoculate.
[02:44:49.490 --> 02:44:51.530]  Use whatever you would like.
[02:44:51.530 --> 02:44:55.370]  You can use either the Plus Life from VegBloom.
[02:44:55.370 --> 02:44:57.290]  Big shout out to VegBloom.
[02:44:57.290 --> 02:45:01.170]  You could use the Rizomix that Botanicare makes.
[02:45:01.970 --> 02:45:02.810]  What am I thinking?
[02:45:02.810 --> 02:45:04.090]  There's one product I'm really thinking,
[02:45:04.090 --> 02:45:05.730]  I can't say the name, OG BioWare.
[02:45:05.730 --> 02:45:08.010]  Use some OG BioWare on that bitch to get your roots going.
[02:45:08.010 --> 02:45:09.570]  So add that to it for roots
[02:45:09.570 --> 02:45:11.390]  and you got pretty much everything you need there.
[02:45:11.390 --> 02:45:12.930]  Week one of flower,
[02:45:12.930 --> 02:45:14.450]  you basically wanna feed the same thing
[02:45:14.450 --> 02:45:16.970]  that you've been feeding for the last couple weeks of veg
[02:45:16.970 --> 02:45:19.290]  because your plants are just gonna start transitioning.
[02:45:19.290 --> 02:45:21.290]  So week one, you've got the option at week one
[02:45:21.290 --> 02:45:24.610]  to switch out that Pure Blend Pro Grow to the Bloom formula
[02:45:24.610 --> 02:45:26.170]  or you can do it at the start of week two
[02:45:26.170 --> 02:45:28.610]  or definitely do it by week three.
[02:45:28.610 --> 02:45:30.330]  Your plants aren't gonna need that much nitrogen
[02:45:30.330 --> 02:45:32.970]  by week three and if you keep going with the Grow formula,
[02:45:32.970 --> 02:45:34.010]  you may burn them.
[02:45:34.010 --> 02:45:37.770]  So you can go the first week or two with your Grow Nutes
[02:45:37.770 --> 02:45:38.850]  and then by week three,
[02:45:38.850 --> 02:45:41.170]  definitely switch all the way into your Flowering Nutes.
[02:45:41.170 --> 02:45:43.570]  You don't need to add everything by week three.
[02:45:43.570 --> 02:45:44.890]  You really don't need a lot at week three.
[02:45:44.890 --> 02:45:47.570]  You can start introducing things slowly.
[02:45:47.570 --> 02:45:49.890]  Maybe get some sugars in there at week three.
[02:45:49.890 --> 02:45:50.850]  You don't need a lot at week three.
[02:45:50.850 --> 02:45:52.130]  By week four, five and six,
[02:45:52.130 --> 02:45:53.850]  that's where things really start cracking.
[02:45:53.850 --> 02:45:56.330]  That's when you're gonna wanna start adding Bud Boosters,
[02:45:56.330 --> 02:45:57.170]  whatever you're gonna use
[02:45:57.170 --> 02:45:58.290]  to make the weight a little thicker,
[02:45:58.290 --> 02:46:00.310]  whatever you're gonna use to sweeten it up.
[02:46:01.290 --> 02:46:02.190]  Four, five and six is when all that shit comes in.
[02:46:02.190 --> 02:46:05.110]  So if you're running a strain that likes a lot of nitrogen,
[02:46:05.110 --> 02:46:06.750]  keep those nitrogen nutrients coming.
[02:46:06.750 --> 02:46:08.790]  Keep that base Grow Nute coming
[02:46:08.790 --> 02:46:09.810]  for the first couple of weeks.
[02:46:09.810 --> 02:46:11.650]  If you've got a strain that's got plenty of nutrients,
[02:46:11.650 --> 02:46:13.250]  if your leaves are nice and lush green,
[02:46:13.250 --> 02:46:14.310]  if they're dark green,
[02:46:14.310 --> 02:46:16.030]  don't even worry about that Grow Nute.
[02:46:16.030 --> 02:46:18.270]  Go ahead and switch it over to the Bloom nutrients.
[02:46:18.270 --> 02:46:20.070]  All right, I hope that answered your question.
[02:46:20.070 --> 02:46:22.590]  I know I used Botanicare as an example.
[02:46:22.590 --> 02:46:23.850]  That's the brand that I use
[02:46:23.850 --> 02:46:27.190]  in my small batch personal grows for myself.
[02:46:27.190 --> 02:46:28.150]  If I'm gonna smoke it,
[02:46:28.150 --> 02:46:30.990]  it's probably grown with Botanicare.
[02:46:30.990 --> 02:46:32.990]  I do plan on doing a side by side
[02:46:32.990 --> 02:46:36.030]  between Botanicare and VegBloom in the near future.
[02:46:36.030 --> 02:46:38.390]  And I will be completely honest about what I see
[02:46:38.390 --> 02:46:40.470]  and I will share my experience
[02:46:40.470 --> 02:46:43.310]  and my results here on the podcast.
[02:46:43.310 --> 02:46:45.710]  You guys make sure you support Botanicare and VegBloom.
[02:46:45.710 --> 02:46:47.470]  I've used them both in different environments
[02:46:47.470 --> 02:46:48.310]  and different scenarios
[02:46:48.310 --> 02:46:49.950]  and they're both wonderful products.
[02:46:49.950 --> 02:46:52.270]  I can't wait to run a side by side.
[02:46:52.270 --> 02:46:53.770]  I've got a five by five hut
[02:46:53.770 --> 02:46:56.150]  and another five by five hydro hut in a room
[02:46:56.150 --> 02:46:58.110]  with very similar light with the same lights.
[02:46:58.950 --> 02:46:59.790]  They're on a flip box.
[02:46:59.790 --> 02:47:01.710]  Every 12 hours one comes on, one shuts off.
[02:47:01.710 --> 02:47:04.310]  So we got a flowering chamber that's always being used.
[02:47:04.310 --> 02:47:05.870]  I'm gonna do VegBloom on one side
[02:47:05.870 --> 02:47:07.750]  and I wanna do Botanicare on the other
[02:47:07.750 --> 02:47:10.270]  and I will completely post a ton of pictures to my Instagram
[02:47:10.270 --> 02:47:12.930]  and I'll let you guys know how it goes.
[02:47:12.930 --> 02:47:14.630]  All right, I wanna thank our friend Mazar420
[02:47:14.630 --> 02:47:15.710]  for sending me a great email
[02:47:15.710 --> 02:47:18.430]  that gave me a lot of information to ramble off at you.
[02:47:18.430 --> 02:47:20.270]  You guys, I'm pulling up the next email here on my phone.
[02:47:20.270 --> 02:47:22.470]  The next email comes from,
[02:47:22.470 --> 02:47:24.190]  he signed it with his real name, I don't know.
[02:47:24.190 --> 02:47:26.070]  Now he says, hi, my name's Kelvin.
[02:47:26.070 --> 02:47:27.550]  Ah, let's see, let's read this.
[02:47:27.550 --> 02:47:29.350]  We have spoken before, but I have another question.
[02:47:29.350 --> 02:47:32.110]  So I live in Oklahoma City where the heat gets pretty hot.
[02:47:32.110 --> 02:47:34.630]  It can get into 100 or above in my garden room.
[02:47:34.630 --> 02:47:36.890]  I was wondering if a bigger carbon filter
[02:47:36.890 --> 02:47:38.150]  would help me out any.
[02:47:38.150 --> 02:47:40.550]  Right now I'm running a 400 watt high pressure sodium
[02:47:40.550 --> 02:47:42.230]  and a metal halide Apollo light
[02:47:42.230 --> 02:47:45.430]  with a four inch carbon filter and inline fan.
[02:47:45.430 --> 02:47:47.070]  I was thinking about getting an air conditioner
[02:47:47.070 --> 02:47:48.950]  but I don't want to if I can lower temps
[02:47:48.950 --> 02:47:50.870]  with the carbon filters.
[02:47:50.870 --> 02:47:55.870]  During the day, the temps get from 110 to 115.
[02:47:56.630 --> 02:47:59.390]  Thank you, Jeff, growers love.
[02:47:59.390 --> 02:48:01.910]  Dude, 110 and 115 in your grow room,
[02:48:01.910 --> 02:48:04.030]  that is tremendously warm for your plants.
[02:48:04.030 --> 02:48:05.030]  Your plants are freaking out.
[02:48:05.030 --> 02:48:08.030]  Development stops, growth and development stops,
[02:48:08.030 --> 02:48:11.390]  production stops inside your plant around 85, 90 degrees
[02:48:11.390 --> 02:48:13.310]  unless you're introducing CO2.
[02:48:13.310 --> 02:48:14.390]  If you're inducing CO2,
[02:48:14.390 --> 02:48:16.510]  if you've got very high levels of CO2,
[02:48:16.510 --> 02:48:19.030]  your plants can tolerate in the 90s.
[02:48:19.030 --> 02:48:21.970]  110 to 115, you're stressing the shit out of those plants.
[02:48:21.970 --> 02:48:23.350]  The buds are starting to spread out.
[02:48:23.350 --> 02:48:24.790]  You're getting airy buds.
[02:48:24.790 --> 02:48:26.430]  They're going to be fluffy.
[02:48:26.430 --> 02:48:27.410]  They're going to be small.
[02:48:27.410 --> 02:48:28.790]  The plants are going to be stunted growth.
[02:48:28.790 --> 02:48:30.990]  The humidity is probably getting fucking ridiculous
[02:48:30.990 --> 02:48:32.850]  in that room with that type of heat.
[02:48:32.850 --> 02:48:34.310]  The good thing about this
[02:48:34.310 --> 02:48:35.930]  is you're not going to have any bugs.
[02:48:35.930 --> 02:48:37.670]  No damn bug in the world is going to want to hang out
[02:48:37.670 --> 02:48:39.910]  in a 115 degree grow room.
[02:48:39.910 --> 02:48:41.630]  So your main question, let's get to the point here.
[02:48:41.630 --> 02:48:44.550]  Your question is, will a carbon filter help cool that room?
[02:48:44.550 --> 02:48:45.510]  No, not at all.
[02:48:45.510 --> 02:48:48.630]  A carbon filter does not provide any cooling.
[02:48:48.630 --> 02:48:53.150]  You need to introduce cooler air into that room
[02:48:53.150 --> 02:48:55.830]  and you need to remove the hot air from the room.
[02:48:55.830 --> 02:48:57.390]  A fan won't help you
[02:48:57.390 --> 02:48:59.150]  because it's just going to blow hot air around.
[02:48:59.150 --> 02:49:00.510]  You need to exchange the air.
[02:49:00.510 --> 02:49:02.530]  You got to get that heat out of there.
[02:49:02.530 --> 02:49:04.830]  Maybe bigger ducting and a bigger blower
[02:49:04.830 --> 02:49:06.210]  to blow the heat out,
[02:49:06.210 --> 02:49:09.430]  but a bigger carbon filter won't help you cool the room.
[02:49:09.430 --> 02:49:11.270]  You need an air conditioner.
[02:49:11.270 --> 02:49:12.270]  If it's a large room,
[02:49:12.270 --> 02:49:15.530]  get yourself a window model, like the window kind.
[02:49:15.530 --> 02:49:17.710]  If it's a smaller room and you don't have a window for it,
[02:49:17.710 --> 02:49:21.690]  get yourself one of those portable rolling air conditioners.
[02:49:21.690 --> 02:49:26.530]  I really like the Solius 14,000 BTU portable air conditioner.
[02:49:26.530 --> 02:49:27.690]  They do not pay me.
[02:49:27.690 --> 02:49:28.690]  They do not sponsor me.
[02:49:28.690 --> 02:49:29.690]  It's what I buy.
[02:49:29.690 --> 02:49:30.730]  If I need an air conditioner,
[02:49:30.730 --> 02:49:33.810]  a rolling air conditioner for a home grow or a small grow,
[02:49:33.810 --> 02:49:38.050]  that's what I go get is one of those Solius 14,000 BTU.
[02:49:38.050 --> 02:49:39.690]  It's a heater, it's an air conditioner,
[02:49:39.690 --> 02:49:42.110]  and it's a dehumidifier all in one unit.
[02:49:42.110 --> 02:49:43.410]  It's about waist high.
[02:49:43.410 --> 02:49:44.450]  It's only about three feet tall.
[02:49:44.450 --> 02:49:45.970]  It looks like a little R2D2, you guys,
[02:49:45.970 --> 02:49:48.290]  and it's got a duct that runs out.
[02:49:48.290 --> 02:49:50.370]  And I think it's got a duct that can come in also
[02:49:50.370 --> 02:49:51.410]  if you choose to duct in,
[02:49:51.410 --> 02:49:52.490]  but I don't duct in.
[02:49:52.490 --> 02:49:55.570]  I just let the air conditioner recycle the air in the room
[02:49:55.570 --> 02:49:56.650]  is where that air comes from.
[02:49:56.650 --> 02:49:58.090]  So that air is already cool kind of
[02:49:58.090 --> 02:49:59.850]  that's going into the compressor.
[02:49:59.850 --> 02:50:03.090]  And then it blows the heat through a duct, a four inch duct,
[02:50:03.090 --> 02:50:05.610]  and you can mount that duct wherever you want.
[02:50:05.610 --> 02:50:07.770]  I usually board up a window,
[02:50:07.770 --> 02:50:09.050]  cut a four inch hole through the window,
[02:50:09.050 --> 02:50:10.410]  put a duct mount onto that window
[02:50:10.410 --> 02:50:12.290]  and run that four inch air conditioning duct
[02:50:12.290 --> 02:50:13.250]  right out of there.
[02:50:15.090 --> 02:50:18.090]  That 14,000 BTU unit would be overkill
[02:50:18.090 --> 02:50:19.890]  for your 400 watt HPS
[02:50:19.890 --> 02:50:22.190]  and your metal halide Apollo light.
[02:50:24.170 --> 02:50:25.890]  I'm assuming that your small grow room
[02:50:25.890 --> 02:50:28.690]  is inside of another room since it's so small.
[02:50:28.690 --> 02:50:31.130]  And I'm not worried that you have a small grow room
[02:50:31.130 --> 02:50:31.950]  and I'm not making fun of you,
[02:50:31.950 --> 02:50:33.130]  but I'm just wondering,
[02:50:33.130 --> 02:50:35.110]  is this grow room inside of another room?
[02:50:35.110 --> 02:50:36.290]  Do you have this, like,
[02:50:36.290 --> 02:50:38.530]  did you construct a small room inside of a bedroom
[02:50:38.530 --> 02:50:40.510]  or this may be a closet also?
[02:50:40.510 --> 02:50:42.050]  But if it's a small room,
[02:50:42.050 --> 02:50:45.070]  maybe you can air condition that room a little bit better
[02:50:45.070 --> 02:50:47.130]  and then duct the heat out of your grow
[02:50:47.130 --> 02:50:49.010]  and just air condition the outside environment
[02:50:49.010 --> 02:50:50.770]  so that you're bringing in cooler air.
[02:50:50.770 --> 02:50:53.010]  You just need cooler air in that room.
[02:50:53.010 --> 02:50:54.730]  Carbon filter's not gonna cool off the air.
[02:50:54.730 --> 02:50:56.190]  A fan is not gonna cool off the air.
[02:50:56.190 --> 02:50:58.170]  You actually need some Freon in there.
[02:50:58.170 --> 02:50:59.650]  You need an air conditioner, bro.
[02:50:59.650 --> 02:51:00.490]  So I hope that works.
[02:51:00.490 --> 02:51:01.650]  I hope I answered your question.
[02:51:01.650 --> 02:51:03.050]  Big shout out to our friend Kelvin.
[02:51:03.050 --> 02:51:04.190]  He says, we've spoken before.
[02:51:04.190 --> 02:51:05.250]  I remember seeing your name.
[02:51:05.250 --> 02:51:07.130]  I remember reading your email address.
[02:51:07.130 --> 02:51:08.110]  Bro, thank you for the email.
[02:51:08.110 --> 02:51:10.010]  I encourage you to send me more emails.
[02:51:10.010 --> 02:51:11.210]  I will read your questions
[02:51:11.210 --> 02:51:14.490]  and answer your questions on the podcast all the time.
[02:51:14.490 --> 02:51:16.690]  If anybody wants to send me an email,
[02:51:17.210 --> 02:51:18.050]  I would love to help you out.
[02:51:18.050 --> 02:51:18.870]  Send me an email.
[02:51:18.870 --> 02:51:21.170]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[02:51:21.170 --> 02:51:24.090]  If you wanna follow me on Twitter, it's at GFYHpodcast.
[02:51:24.090 --> 02:51:25.410]  Check me out on Instagram, you guys.
[02:51:25.410 --> 02:51:28.770]  I post a whole bunch of quality cannabis photography
[02:51:28.770 --> 02:51:29.710]  on Instagram.
[02:51:29.710 --> 02:51:32.150]  It's at Irie underscore genetics.
[02:51:32.150 --> 02:51:36.010]  Irie, I-R-I-E underscore genetics.
[02:51:36.010 --> 02:51:36.850]  Check that out.
[02:51:36.850 --> 02:51:37.930]  You guys, I have to press pause for one quick second.
[02:51:37.930 --> 02:51:39.010]  I'm gonna take a dab in a drink
[02:51:39.010 --> 02:51:40.610]  and I will be right back with you.
[02:51:42.010 --> 02:51:44.370]  Yeah, I just took a big old fat dab
[02:51:44.370 --> 02:51:46.970]  of pineapple jack shatter from Turpex
[02:51:46.970 --> 02:51:50.250]  and I dunked it in OG ghost rain haze fresh turps
[02:51:50.250 --> 02:51:52.490]  from our friends at EvoLabs.
[02:51:52.490 --> 02:51:56.130]  And I feel like my brain was put on a rocket
[02:51:56.130 --> 02:51:58.030]  and launched into outer space.
[02:51:58.030 --> 02:52:00.490]  And then it blew up like one of those beautiful fireworks
[02:52:00.490 --> 02:52:01.850]  and then it all just came back together
[02:52:01.850 --> 02:52:03.930]  and floated down into my head.
[02:52:03.930 --> 02:52:05.850]  That's what happens when you dunk your dabs in turps
[02:52:05.850 --> 02:52:07.610]  and you take big old fat dabs.
[02:52:07.610 --> 02:52:08.770]  Woo!
[02:52:08.770 --> 02:52:11.450]  Shout out to everybody involved in making these turps happen.
[02:52:11.650 --> 02:52:14.890]  I had the lab manager from EvoLabs on the last podcast
[02:52:14.890 --> 02:52:18.170]  and that's the one that the memory card ate
[02:52:18.170 --> 02:52:19.410]  and we cannot listen to.
[02:52:19.410 --> 02:52:21.450]  So sorry, Brett, I wish we could have done that.
[02:52:21.450 --> 02:52:23.130]  But Brett, that means you gotta come back on the show
[02:52:23.130 --> 02:52:24.650]  and smoke some turps with me.
[02:52:24.650 --> 02:52:26.730]  I owe a huge thank you to Dab and Granny
[02:52:26.730 --> 02:52:28.010]  and I owe a huge thank you to Brett.
[02:52:28.010 --> 02:52:30.850]  Dab and Granny showed up with enough turps
[02:52:30.850 --> 02:52:35.490]  to dab out an army and Brett tried to compete with that.
[02:52:35.490 --> 02:52:37.530]  So big thanks to you guys for showing up to the podcast.
[02:52:37.530 --> 02:52:38.410]  Well prepared.
[02:52:38.410 --> 02:52:39.610]  Also thanks to the Cannon Canyon
[02:52:39.610 --> 02:52:43.530]  for letting me invade the small corner of their facility.
[02:52:43.530 --> 02:52:45.890]  I had four couches and a table occupied
[02:52:45.890 --> 02:52:47.170]  and nobody could hang out in that region
[02:52:47.170 --> 02:52:48.810]  because we were doing the podcast.
[02:52:48.810 --> 02:52:50.090]  I didn't mind if people hung out,
[02:52:50.090 --> 02:52:51.450]  but when they saw the microphones come out
[02:52:51.450 --> 02:52:52.290]  and they heard me talking,
[02:52:52.290 --> 02:52:53.890]  they all just took off to be polite.
[02:52:53.890 --> 02:52:54.930]  I don't mind if they hang out.
[02:52:54.930 --> 02:52:55.770]  I like it.
[02:52:55.770 --> 02:52:56.610]  I think it's cool.
[02:52:56.610 --> 02:52:58.410]  I like the ambience and the vibe in the background.
[02:52:58.410 --> 02:53:00.090]  All right, I am rambling like a motherfucker.
[02:53:00.090 --> 02:53:02.450]  Hashtag, they like it when I ramble.
[02:53:02.450 --> 02:53:04.850]  I wanted to share with you guys a little progress
[02:53:04.850 --> 02:53:07.970]  on my most current breeding project.
[02:53:07.970 --> 02:53:09.930]  If you follow me, you know that I am a breeder.
[02:53:09.930 --> 02:53:12.530]  I am the head breeder for Iry Genetics.
[02:53:12.530 --> 02:53:14.770]  I am currently working with a male plant
[02:53:14.770 --> 02:53:16.170]  that I call Arise.
[02:53:16.170 --> 02:53:17.490]  The strain is known as Arise.
[02:53:17.490 --> 02:53:20.170]  The male plant himself has been named Solomon.
[02:53:20.170 --> 02:53:21.250]  That is King Solomon.
[02:53:21.250 --> 02:53:23.370]  He is going to father many children.
[02:53:23.370 --> 02:53:25.570]  He will be the grandfather to many children,
[02:53:25.570 --> 02:53:27.450]  but Solomon is my male plant.
[02:53:27.450 --> 02:53:29.050]  He is an Arise plant,
[02:53:29.050 --> 02:53:31.690]  which is a cross of a golden goat female
[02:53:31.690 --> 02:53:33.850]  that was pollinated by a Daybreaker male.
[02:53:33.850 --> 02:53:35.930]  Daybreaker came from Gage Green Genetics.
[02:53:35.970 --> 02:53:38.690]  So much love and respect to Gage Green.
[02:53:38.690 --> 02:53:41.610]  The Daybreaker is Joseph OG and Kim D.
[02:53:42.490 --> 02:53:44.330]  So there's going to be a little bit of OG Kush
[02:53:44.330 --> 02:53:46.090]  and Kim Dog lineage in there.
[02:53:46.090 --> 02:53:47.690]  And then I crossed that to,
[02:53:47.690 --> 02:53:50.650]  I put the pollen from that male onto the golden goat.
[02:53:50.650 --> 02:53:52.450]  The golden goat is Island Sweetskunk
[02:53:52.450 --> 02:53:54.570]  and Romulan and a Hawaiian Sativa.
[02:53:54.570 --> 02:53:56.450]  So you got that tropical tasty flavor.
[02:53:56.450 --> 02:54:00.330]  I pollinated it with that cushy, skunky, funk flavor.
[02:54:00.330 --> 02:54:02.050]  A little bit of everything, in my opinion.
[02:54:02.050 --> 02:54:03.490]  Mixed it all together.
[02:54:03.490 --> 02:54:05.330]  And it made a strain called Arise.
[02:54:06.090 --> 02:54:09.410]  I found three or four really great phenotypes of the Arise.
[02:54:09.410 --> 02:54:12.170]  There's a very golden goat reminiscent phenotype of Arise.
[02:54:12.170 --> 02:54:14.530]  I do not keep that one because I've got golden goat.
[02:54:14.530 --> 02:54:15.370]  It's too similar.
[02:54:15.370 --> 02:54:16.730]  I get rid of it.
[02:54:16.730 --> 02:54:19.970]  There's one that's got this sweet, skunky, funky,
[02:54:19.970 --> 02:54:22.050]  you can't keep it in a baggie without all your friends
[02:54:22.050 --> 02:54:23.610]  saying, smoke some of that weed with me,
[02:54:23.610 --> 02:54:24.970]  kind of smell to it.
[02:54:24.970 --> 02:54:26.690]  That's my favorite female of the bunch.
[02:54:26.690 --> 02:54:29.730]  Then there's one that makes really long, skinny buds.
[02:54:29.730 --> 02:54:30.970]  And I don't know where it came from,
[02:54:30.970 --> 02:54:32.530]  but it gives you this hazy eye.
[02:54:32.530 --> 02:54:34.370]  I don't know where the haze came from in the genetics,
[02:54:34.410 --> 02:54:36.050]  but it just makes your head melt.
[02:54:36.050 --> 02:54:38.290]  Your eyes just get retarded, squinty.
[02:54:38.290 --> 02:54:40.530]  You go dumb, you just start stuttering.
[02:54:40.530 --> 02:54:42.130]  It's that phenotype is great.
[02:54:42.130 --> 02:54:44.730]  But anyway, there are three or four key phenotypes
[02:54:44.730 --> 02:54:45.690]  that I've found.
[02:54:45.690 --> 02:54:47.530]  I've put all three of those phenotypes,
[02:54:47.530 --> 02:54:49.250]  not the golden goat dominant phenotype,
[02:54:49.250 --> 02:54:52.130]  but I've put my three favorite phenotypes in a room
[02:54:52.130 --> 02:54:54.570]  with a male of this same cultivar,
[02:54:54.570 --> 02:54:56.930]  but the male of the same strain from the same seed pack.
[02:54:56.930 --> 02:54:58.210]  They're all F1s.
[02:54:58.210 --> 02:55:00.610]  So I put the F1s, the male and the female in a room.
[02:55:00.610 --> 02:55:03.130]  This male, I posted pictures of him to my Instagram.
[02:55:03.130 --> 02:55:07.090]  He makes male flower clusters as long as my arm,
[02:55:07.090 --> 02:55:09.330]  which is very amazing for a male plant
[02:55:09.330 --> 02:55:10.250]  to make buds like this.
[02:55:10.250 --> 02:55:11.090]  It's incredible.
[02:55:11.090 --> 02:55:12.650]  It's got a little bit of resin on it.
[02:55:12.650 --> 02:55:14.370]  It smells very pungent.
[02:55:14.370 --> 02:55:16.370]  It's got a hint of vomit to the smell.
[02:55:16.370 --> 02:55:18.850]  As a breeder, vomit is a good trait.
[02:55:18.850 --> 02:55:21.410]  If you've got a male plant that smells like vomit
[02:55:21.410 --> 02:55:24.050]  or feet or a bar trash can,
[02:55:24.050 --> 02:55:25.330]  that is a good breeding plant.
[02:55:25.330 --> 02:55:29.090]  That's going to pass on good, good aromatic traits.
[02:55:29.090 --> 02:55:30.610]  So I've got that male.
[02:55:30.610 --> 02:55:32.570]  And then I've got, let's see what else is in there.
[02:55:33.010 --> 02:55:34.290]  There is a golden goat female
[02:55:34.290 --> 02:55:35.290]  because I'm going to do a little bit
[02:55:35.290 --> 02:55:36.810]  of a golden goat back cross.
[02:55:36.810 --> 02:55:38.490]  There's a lemon skunk female in there
[02:55:38.490 --> 02:55:40.170]  because I want to see what this Arise does
[02:55:40.170 --> 02:55:41.770]  to the lemon skunk.
[02:55:41.770 --> 02:55:44.650]  And there is a grateful dog female.
[02:55:44.650 --> 02:55:47.850]  So there are multiple phenotypes of the Arise.
[02:55:47.850 --> 02:55:50.970]  So there'll be Arise F2s coming out very soon.
[02:55:50.970 --> 02:55:53.130]  It'll be tested by a bunch of my people
[02:55:53.130 --> 02:55:54.650]  before they're available to you guys.
[02:55:54.650 --> 02:55:56.850]  But a lot of people get to test them out.
[02:55:56.850 --> 02:55:58.490]  Then there'll be grateful dog to Arise,
[02:55:58.490 --> 02:55:59.890]  which doesn't even have a name.
[02:55:59.890 --> 02:56:01.770]  There will be golden goat to Arise,
[02:56:01.770 --> 02:56:04.610]  which would be like a golden goat back cross kind of.
[02:56:04.610 --> 02:56:06.570]  And then there'll be lemon skunk cross to Arise,
[02:56:06.570 --> 02:56:08.410]  which who knows what that's going to do.
[02:56:08.410 --> 02:56:10.530]  That's going to be amazing.
[02:56:10.530 --> 02:56:12.170]  Both of those plants make a lot of resin.
[02:56:12.170 --> 02:56:14.770]  Both of those plants have a really nice structure.
[02:56:14.770 --> 02:56:16.050]  I really see a lot of great things.
[02:56:16.050 --> 02:56:16.930]  So I'm excited about that.
[02:56:16.930 --> 02:56:19.490]  They are currently, the date today is,
[02:56:19.490 --> 02:56:21.170]  I'm pressing my button on my phone, it's the 14th.
[02:56:21.170 --> 02:56:24.450]  They went into flower on the 3rd, so they're 11 days in.
[02:56:24.450 --> 02:56:26.970]  The male plant is getting big old balls.
[02:56:26.970 --> 02:56:28.770]  His balls are starting, you know when the male plant
[02:56:28.770 --> 02:56:30.850]  starts to flower out, the balls point up.
[02:56:30.850 --> 02:56:32.130]  But now they're starting to hang.
[02:56:32.130 --> 02:56:33.250]  His nuts are starting to hang,
[02:56:33.250 --> 02:56:35.170]  which means within the next four to six days,
[02:56:35.170 --> 02:56:36.490]  I'm going to have pollen coming out of there,
[02:56:36.490 --> 02:56:38.050]  which may be a little earlier than I wanted.
[02:56:38.050 --> 02:56:39.810]  So I'm going to move him over to another room
[02:56:39.810 --> 02:56:41.850]  to keep him away from the girls,
[02:56:41.850 --> 02:56:43.970]  because the girls, their pistils,
[02:56:43.970 --> 02:56:45.730]  the little, you guys call them hairs probably,
[02:56:45.730 --> 02:56:47.930]  the little white pistils, the hairs on the plant
[02:56:47.930 --> 02:56:48.930]  that looks like a dandelion.
[02:56:48.930 --> 02:56:51.010]  I want those nice and thick and stout
[02:56:51.010 --> 02:56:52.770]  before I put that pollen on there.
[02:56:52.770 --> 02:56:54.530]  So I'm going to move this boy to another area
[02:56:54.530 --> 02:56:56.530]  just to keep him from dusting his pollen
[02:56:56.530 --> 02:56:58.010]  on these girls too early.
[02:56:58.010 --> 02:57:00.050]  And then once I see all the girls have their pistils
[02:57:00.050 --> 02:57:02.370]  nice and hairy, nice and furry,
[02:57:02.370 --> 02:57:04.050]  almost that tarantula look,
[02:57:04.050 --> 02:57:05.730]  then I'm going to bring the boy over there
[02:57:05.730 --> 02:57:06.890]  and I'm going to just leave him in the room
[02:57:06.890 --> 02:57:07.970]  with them overnight.
[02:57:07.970 --> 02:57:09.610]  And then in the morning, as soon as the lights come on,
[02:57:09.610 --> 02:57:10.690]  I'm going to give him a little shake.
[02:57:10.690 --> 02:57:12.930]  And that pollen is just going to dust all those plants.
[02:57:12.930 --> 02:57:15.610]  And then I'm going to do that probably four or five days
[02:57:15.610 --> 02:57:17.370]  again, or four or five days later,
[02:57:17.370 --> 02:57:18.570]  I'm going to do that again.
[02:57:18.570 --> 02:57:20.290]  Just let the lights come on and walk in there
[02:57:20.290 --> 02:57:21.370]  and give him a little bit of a shake
[02:57:21.370 --> 02:57:23.690]  and just get that pollen all over all those plants.
[02:57:23.690 --> 02:57:25.730]  And when I say a little bit of a shake, guys,
[02:57:25.730 --> 02:57:29.050]  if you grab a male cannabis plant that is in full flower,
[02:57:29.130 --> 02:57:31.210]  that's got pollen sacks hanging off of it,
[02:57:31.210 --> 02:57:32.050]  you can flick it.
[02:57:32.050 --> 02:57:34.610]  Like, listen to, I'm going to flick the microphone stand.
[02:57:34.610 --> 02:57:35.450]  That's all you got to do.
[02:57:35.450 --> 02:57:39.570]  You flick it that hard, pollen goes everywhere, everywhere.
[02:57:39.570 --> 02:57:41.410]  So after that, I'll have to take a shower,
[02:57:41.410 --> 02:57:43.050]  I'll have to change clothes.
[02:57:43.050 --> 02:57:45.010]  I'll have to go spray down any female plants
[02:57:45.010 --> 02:57:46.730]  that I do not want receiving pollen.
[02:57:46.730 --> 02:57:47.690]  It'll be some work,
[02:57:47.690 --> 02:57:49.450]  but it'll be definitely, definitely worth it.
[02:57:49.450 --> 02:57:51.330]  I'll have to change clothes, wash my dreadlocks
[02:57:51.330 --> 02:57:53.050]  before I go to anybody else's garden.
[02:57:53.050 --> 02:57:55.530]  I wouldn't disrespect anyone else's garden like that.
[02:57:55.530 --> 02:57:57.650]  I'll put on specific clothes that cover me up
[02:57:57.650 --> 02:57:59.290]  most of the way so that I can just drop them
[02:57:59.290 --> 02:58:00.930]  right in the washer.
[02:58:00.930 --> 02:58:03.250]  It's a chore, but that's where my breeding project is,
[02:58:03.250 --> 02:58:04.090]  you guys.
[02:58:04.090 --> 02:58:05.290]  The male is just getting ready to drop pollen.
[02:58:05.290 --> 02:58:06.490]  Damn, I just kicked the dog again.
[02:58:06.490 --> 02:58:07.730]  I'm sorry, boy.
[02:58:07.730 --> 02:58:08.570]  I'm sorry, dude.
[02:58:08.570 --> 02:58:09.410]  I didn't mean to kick you.
[02:58:09.410 --> 02:58:10.490]  His head's right here on my foot.
[02:58:10.490 --> 02:58:11.610]  So every time I get excited,
[02:58:11.610 --> 02:58:13.490]  I move my foot and give him a good head kick.
[02:58:13.490 --> 02:58:15.050]  This ain't no UFC over here.
[02:58:15.050 --> 02:58:15.970]  I apologize.
[02:58:15.970 --> 02:58:19.850]  So my plants are, the breeding project is 11 days.
[02:58:19.850 --> 02:58:21.330]  The males are just dropping pollen.
[02:58:21.330 --> 02:58:22.930]  The male is just starting to drop pollen.
[02:58:22.930 --> 02:58:25.530]  The females are almost ready to take it.
[02:58:25.530 --> 02:58:26.850]  I'm going to separate them for a little bit
[02:58:26.850 --> 02:58:28.650]  just to put some tension in the room.
[02:58:29.530 --> 02:58:32.090]  Then I'm going to reintroduce them together in a few days.
[02:58:32.090 --> 02:58:33.410]  And then once they pollinate,
[02:58:33.410 --> 02:58:35.530]  it's probably going to be about six weeks
[02:58:35.530 --> 02:58:37.210]  before those seeds are ready for harvest.
[02:58:37.210 --> 02:58:39.810]  I'm going to let them go about seven.
[02:58:39.810 --> 02:58:40.970]  I don't want to let them go too long,
[02:58:40.970 --> 02:58:41.970]  but I want them nice and done.
[02:58:41.970 --> 02:58:43.130]  I want them hard.
[02:58:43.130 --> 02:58:44.690]  Then we'll cut down the plants.
[02:58:44.690 --> 02:58:47.090]  We will set them all in individual areas
[02:58:47.090 --> 02:58:48.450]  over individual containers
[02:58:48.450 --> 02:58:50.850]  and just let them dry for a couple few days.
[02:58:50.850 --> 02:58:52.970]  Once they, we'll pre-trim them at that point.
[02:58:52.970 --> 02:58:55.330]  We'll give them, we'll just take off all the big leaves
[02:58:55.330 --> 02:58:56.450]  when we cut them down.
[02:58:56.850 --> 02:58:57.890]  Most of the fan leaves will be gone.
[02:58:57.890 --> 02:59:00.330]  So we'll dry it, we'll hang them, we'll let them dry.
[02:59:00.330 --> 02:59:01.570]  And then you just take the plants
[02:59:01.570 --> 02:59:03.930]  and you cut, basically cut one stick off.
[02:59:03.930 --> 02:59:06.570]  And I put on rubber gloves and hold it over like a pie plate
[02:59:06.570 --> 02:59:07.850]  and just start crushing up the buds.
[02:59:07.850 --> 02:59:09.330]  And you can just hear the seeds fall out.
[02:59:09.330 --> 02:59:11.450]  It's like you're smoking old school Mexican brickweed
[02:59:11.450 --> 02:59:12.450]  and all those seeds are just going
[02:59:12.450 --> 02:59:14.290]  tink, tink, tink, tink, tink, tink, tink, tink, tink, tink
[02:59:14.290 --> 02:59:15.570]  into the pie plate.
[02:59:15.570 --> 02:59:17.490]  Just crumble them up with my fingers.
[02:59:17.490 --> 02:59:19.410]  And then I push all the weed up to one side
[02:59:19.410 --> 02:59:21.210]  and I tip the pan and all the seeds roll down
[02:59:21.210 --> 02:59:22.290]  to the other side and I take those out
[02:59:22.290 --> 02:59:23.490]  and put them in a jar.
[02:59:23.490 --> 02:59:25.970]  It gets carefully labeled of what it is.
[02:59:26.490 --> 02:59:27.570]  I'll leave the lid open for a couple of few days
[02:59:27.570 --> 02:59:29.330]  just so that if there's any moisture in there
[02:59:29.330 --> 02:59:31.610]  that those seeds will dry out.
[02:59:31.610 --> 02:59:34.730]  So now I've got a Mason jar full of well-labeled seeds.
[02:59:34.730 --> 02:59:36.370]  And then once I've got all of them,
[02:59:36.370 --> 02:59:38.050]  I'll weigh the seeds, get a good estimate
[02:59:38.050 --> 02:59:39.210]  of how many seeds I've got.
[02:59:39.210 --> 02:59:41.690]  And then I'll send a lot of those seeds out
[02:59:41.690 --> 02:59:43.370]  to friends of mine with a note that says,
[02:59:43.370 --> 02:59:44.650]  these are testers.
[02:59:44.650 --> 02:59:46.770]  Please test these, take a lot of pictures,
[02:59:46.770 --> 02:59:48.810]  make a lot of notes, let me know what you got.
[02:59:48.810 --> 02:59:50.730]  I will give some to local people.
[02:59:50.730 --> 02:59:53.490]  And the requirement is if you find a champion,
[02:59:53.490 --> 02:59:54.650]  I get a clone of that sucker.
[02:59:54.730 --> 02:59:55.650]  If you've got something good,
[02:59:55.650 --> 02:59:58.050]  I get a clone of the best one, please.
[02:59:58.050 --> 02:59:59.650]  That's kinda how that goes.
[02:59:59.650 --> 03:00:01.170]  So I'll give you some tester packs.
[03:00:01.170 --> 03:00:03.370]  It'll be probably looking at 12 weeks
[03:00:03.370 --> 03:00:05.970]  before anything will even be done from this point.
[03:00:05.970 --> 03:00:07.650]  But there will be seeds in 12 weeks.
[03:00:07.650 --> 03:00:09.010]  There'll be testers.
[03:00:09.010 --> 03:00:09.850]  People will check them out.
[03:00:09.850 --> 03:00:10.970]  I'll post pictures of what comes of it
[03:00:10.970 --> 03:00:12.410]  because I'll grow a bunch of them by myself.
[03:00:12.410 --> 03:00:13.370]  The dog just got up and left
[03:00:13.370 --> 03:00:14.490]  because I kicked him in the head.
[03:00:14.490 --> 03:00:15.610]  I'm sorry, boy.
[03:00:15.610 --> 03:00:17.410]  Sorry, I didn't mean to kick you.
[03:00:17.410 --> 03:00:18.810]  You guys, don't ever kick your dog in the head.
[03:00:18.810 --> 03:00:20.410]  Love your dog, scratch your dog.
[03:00:21.570 --> 03:00:22.850]  And breed good cannabis.
[03:00:22.850 --> 03:00:24.530]  Ladies and gentlemen, I think that is all I've got
[03:00:25.410 --> 03:00:26.250]  for you this week.
[03:00:26.250 --> 03:00:27.090]  I wanted to update you on my breeding project.
[03:00:27.090 --> 03:00:30.050]  I hope you enjoy following along with my breeding project.
[03:00:30.050 --> 03:00:31.570]  I'll give you another update in a couple of weeks
[03:00:31.570 --> 03:00:33.330]  and let you know how things are going.
[03:00:33.330 --> 03:00:34.490]  You guys, I'm gonna wrap up the show.
[03:00:34.490 --> 03:00:36.490]  If you've got a product you'd like me to review
[03:00:36.490 --> 03:00:37.890]  or if you'd like to sponsor the podcast,
[03:00:37.890 --> 03:00:38.730]  send me an email.
[03:00:38.730 --> 03:00:40.170]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
