[00:16.640 --> 00:19.160]  Welcome back, Cannabis community.
[00:19.160 --> 00:21.000]  It's time for episode number 291
[00:21.000 --> 00:22.880]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:22.880 --> 00:26.600]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:26.600 --> 00:27.760]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:27.760 --> 00:29.080]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.080 --> 00:31.480]  you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber.
[00:31.480 --> 00:32.760]  If you're a cannabis activist,
[00:32.760 --> 00:34.260]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:34.260 --> 00:36.120]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:36.120 --> 00:39.040]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:39.040 --> 00:41.080]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:41.080 --> 00:43.080]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:43.080 --> 00:45.320]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:45.320 --> 00:46.960]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:46.960 --> 00:49.440]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:49.440 --> 00:51.280]  Big shout out to Kat, Coop,
[00:51.280 --> 00:53.540]  and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:55.160 --> 00:57.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, this episode of the podcast
[00:57.120 --> 01:00.040]  is brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Bank.
[01:00.040 --> 01:02.080]  That's right, if you need to add new seeds to your garden,
[01:02.080 --> 01:04.280]  I recommend the Hella Dank Seed Bank.
[01:04.280 --> 01:06.760]  Check them out at dankseed.store.
[01:08.840 --> 01:09.800]  All right, podcast world,
[01:09.800 --> 01:11.160]  I like to start these episodes off
[01:11.160 --> 01:13.600]  by talking about what I've been smoking on for the day,
[01:13.600 --> 01:17.760]  and today I've been dabbing the Sour Clem
[01:17.760 --> 01:19.120]  from Apothecary Extracts.
[01:19.120 --> 01:21.080]  That's right, they ran the Sour Diesel
[01:21.080 --> 01:22.520]  and the Clementine together,
[01:22.520 --> 01:24.200]  and they made a batter out of it,
[01:24.200 --> 01:26.740]  and it looks and smells and tastes amazing,
[01:26.740 --> 01:29.080]  and the head high has been perfect lately
[01:29.080 --> 01:31.060]  for what I've been trying to do.
[01:31.060 --> 01:32.960]  I wish you could smell this through the microphone.
[01:32.960 --> 01:33.840]  I'm opening it up,
[01:33.840 --> 01:35.760]  and I'm waving it at the microphone just for you,
[01:35.760 --> 01:37.560]  and you can't even smell it.
[01:37.560 --> 01:40.120]  There's a little hint of Sour Diesel in the bottom,
[01:40.120 --> 01:42.760]  but then it's got this candy Clementine terp at the top
[01:42.760 --> 01:44.280]  that is just amazing.
[01:44.280 --> 01:45.840]  The combo is perfect.
[01:45.840 --> 01:47.080]  It's been working very well
[01:47.080 --> 01:49.160]  for what I need done the past few days,
[01:49.160 --> 01:50.920]  so big shout out to our friends at Apothecary.
[01:50.920 --> 01:51.960]  They do not pay me to say that.
[01:51.960 --> 01:54.180]  I actually pay for all the concentrates that I buy.
[01:54.180 --> 01:55.960]  I just enjoy it a lot.
[01:55.960 --> 02:00.080]  Also, I just took a half gram dab of Shatter
[02:00.080 --> 02:01.800]  from Concentrate Supply Company.
[02:01.800 --> 02:04.180]  I have some lemon medicine
[02:04.180 --> 02:06.040]  that I picked up at Three Rivers.
[02:06.040 --> 02:09.600]  My mouth tastes like a watermelon and a lemon
[02:09.600 --> 02:12.720]  and another tropical fruit, and I approve.
[02:13.560 --> 02:15.080]  It was a little heavy.
[02:15.080 --> 02:16.680]  It got me a little more lit than I needed to be
[02:16.680 --> 02:19.700]  for a podcast, but I'm sure I'll be able to shake that off.
[02:19.700 --> 02:21.080]  I've got some great stuff to talk about,
[02:21.080 --> 02:22.460]  so let's get into that.
[02:22.460 --> 02:23.300]  I had a great weekend.
[02:23.300 --> 02:24.800]  I want to brag for a minute.
[02:24.800 --> 02:27.840]  Saturday and Sunday, I got to go see Doug Benson
[02:27.840 --> 02:30.320]  at the Comedy Works in downtown Denver.
[02:30.320 --> 02:32.740]  Comedy Works is one of the two best comedy clubs
[02:32.740 --> 02:33.580]  on the planet.
[02:33.580 --> 02:35.040]  There's Comedy Works in Denver,
[02:35.040 --> 02:36.720]  and then there's the Comedy Store in LA,
[02:36.720 --> 02:40.960]  which is where Joe Rogan and Joey Diaz and Chris D'Elia
[02:40.960 --> 02:42.080]  and all those guys hang out,
[02:42.080 --> 02:43.520]  and gals there, gals there too.
[02:43.520 --> 02:45.820]  Ali Wong and Eliza's there.
[02:45.820 --> 02:47.600]  Those guys and gals, they all hang out,
[02:47.600 --> 02:49.480]  but the Comedy Works is what we've got,
[02:49.480 --> 02:50.840]  and it's just two hours away from me.
[02:50.840 --> 02:53.380]  It's about 120 miles, and I love the place.
[02:53.380 --> 02:54.400]  They treat me like royalty
[02:54.400 --> 02:56.080]  because I've developed a relationship with them.
[02:56.080 --> 02:57.740]  I've made friends with a bunch of the people.
[02:57.740 --> 03:00.920]  Anyhow, Doug Benson was there for Saturday and Sunday shows,
[03:00.920 --> 03:03.160]  and I got to go see the shows and hang out with Doug
[03:03.160 --> 03:04.760]  and a couple of his friends.
[03:04.760 --> 03:08.180]  Saturday, Doug did a stand-up comedy show.
[03:08.180 --> 03:10.680]  Doug likes to start his stand-up comedy shows.
[03:10.680 --> 03:13.840]  Usually, there's an opener or an emcee even,
[03:13.840 --> 03:15.280]  and an emcee will come out and talk
[03:15.280 --> 03:17.480]  for about five or 10 minutes and get the crowd loosened up,
[03:17.480 --> 03:20.080]  and then they will introduce the opener.
[03:20.080 --> 03:23.240]  It'll be maybe emcee opener or just opener
[03:23.240 --> 03:24.920]  and then a feature act.
[03:24.920 --> 03:26.520]  You'll have a local guy usually,
[03:26.520 --> 03:28.720]  like some guy that you could barely tolerate for 10 minutes.
[03:28.720 --> 03:30.160]  They'll give him seven minutes of time.
[03:30.160 --> 03:32.880]  He'll go out, and then he'll pass the mic to the feature act,
[03:32.880 --> 03:35.480]  and the feature will do 20, 30 minutes,
[03:35.480 --> 03:37.280]  and then he will bring out the headliner,
[03:37.280 --> 03:39.480]  or he will pass the mic back to the emcee,
[03:39.480 --> 03:41.040]  and then he'll bring out the headliner,
[03:41.040 --> 03:42.840]  and the headliner will come out, and everyone will cheer,
[03:42.840 --> 03:44.800]  and then he'll do his probably an hour,
[03:44.800 --> 03:46.880]  45 to an hour and 15, just depends on who it is.
[03:46.880 --> 03:49.360]  If it was Ralphie Mae, Ralphie Mae used to do
[03:49.360 --> 03:50.500]  fucking three hours.
[03:50.500 --> 03:53.120]  Chappelle will go on all fucking night if you let him.
[03:53.120 --> 03:56.180]  Most of the guys do 45 to an hour, hour and 15-ish.
[03:56.180 --> 03:58.640]  Anyhow, Doug Benson likes to come out
[03:58.640 --> 03:59.880]  and start the show himself.
[03:59.880 --> 04:02.800]  He walks right out on stage, and he starts doing comedy.
[04:02.800 --> 04:04.620]  Then he likes to get into tweets.
[04:04.620 --> 04:07.120]  Doug Benson will read his tweets on stage,
[04:07.120 --> 04:08.880]  but it's funny because people like myself
[04:08.920 --> 04:10.760]  that know he's gonna read those tweets
[04:10.760 --> 04:13.200]  will tweet him funny shit right before the show,
[04:13.200 --> 04:14.660]  or just tweet him something before the show
[04:14.660 --> 04:16.760]  so that he will read it on the show on stage,
[04:16.760 --> 04:18.600]  and everybody gets a good laugh.
[04:18.600 --> 04:21.480]  One thing that kinda kills that at ComedyWorks,
[04:21.480 --> 04:24.000]  when you walk in, they ask you to put your phone
[04:24.000 --> 04:26.800]  in these little, it looks like a body glove wetsuit
[04:26.800 --> 04:29.200]  for your phone is honestly what it makes me think of.
[04:29.200 --> 04:31.000]  And it's got the, you know the thing at the mall,
[04:31.000 --> 04:33.360]  they put on the jeans so you can't steal them,
[04:33.360 --> 04:34.960]  and then they gotta put it on that little machine,
[04:34.960 --> 04:36.480]  it goes pop, and then it opens it right up.
[04:36.480 --> 04:38.400]  They put, it's got that kind of enclosure,
[04:38.920 --> 04:41.040]  so your phone is in a little body glove wetsuit
[04:41.040 --> 04:43.160]  with a little magnetized enclosure on it,
[04:43.160 --> 04:45.520]  so you can't access your phone during the comedy show.
[04:45.520 --> 04:46.640]  A lot of people hate that.
[04:46.640 --> 04:47.880]  You know what, I think it's awesome.
[04:47.880 --> 04:50.800]  I'm not there to watch people play on their phones,
[04:50.800 --> 04:52.120]  I'm not there to play on my phone,
[04:52.120 --> 04:53.880]  I don't wanna be distracted by my phone,
[04:53.880 --> 04:55.840]  somebody else's phone, any of that shit.
[04:55.840 --> 04:58.060]  I wanna pay attention to the comedy show,
[04:58.060 --> 04:59.280]  and the comedians appreciate it
[04:59.280 --> 05:01.220]  because they deliver a better show.
[05:01.220 --> 05:03.520]  But that kinda messes up Doug Benson's little game
[05:03.520 --> 05:05.160]  where you can tweet him while he's on stage
[05:05.160 --> 05:06.000]  and he'll read your stuff.
[05:06.000 --> 05:08.700]  But he did read my tweet.
[05:08.700 --> 05:10.640]  Doug, of course I've seen Doug Benson a lot of times.
[05:10.640 --> 05:12.640]  He asked me how many times, from the stage,
[05:12.640 --> 05:14.400]  he asked me how many times I've seen him.
[05:14.400 --> 05:15.760]  I told him at least 15.
[05:15.760 --> 05:18.480]  I think it was closer to 17 or 20, I didn't wanna lie,
[05:18.480 --> 05:20.520]  so I said about 15 times.
[05:20.520 --> 05:22.720]  He made fun of me for a little bit.
[05:22.720 --> 05:25.480]  I ate a lot of edibles and I tweeted him about that,
[05:25.480 --> 05:27.220]  and he made fun of me for eating so many edibles
[05:27.220 --> 05:28.720]  and asked me what I ate.
[05:28.720 --> 05:30.440]  And we talked about that from the stage.
[05:30.440 --> 05:32.680]  He was yelling at me from the stage to the audience,
[05:32.680 --> 05:33.920]  so that was kinda funny.
[05:33.920 --> 05:36.240]  So Doug came out and opened the show.
[05:36.240 --> 05:38.200]  Then he brought out his friend and my friend,
[05:38.200 --> 05:41.080]  also another comedian, named Trey Galeon.
[05:41.080 --> 05:44.000]  Trey came and did, I think he did about 30 minutes.
[05:44.000 --> 05:46.720]  And then Trey did 30 and then passed the mic
[05:46.720 --> 05:48.880]  back over to Doug, and Doug came out
[05:48.880 --> 05:51.360]  and did about 15 or 20 minutes of comedy.
[05:51.360 --> 05:54.040]  And then they played a game.
[05:54.040 --> 05:55.540]  So here's the deal.
[05:55.540 --> 05:58.240]  On Sunday they were doing the Doug Loves Movies podcast.
[05:58.240 --> 06:01.680]  Doug has five, four or five podcasts.
[06:01.680 --> 06:05.360]  And Doug Loves Movies was being recorded on Sunday.
[06:05.360 --> 06:08.940]  They play movie trivia games
[06:08.940 --> 06:10.840]  on the Doug Loves Movies podcast.
[06:10.840 --> 06:14.040]  So at the end of the comedy show,
[06:14.040 --> 06:16.560]  people who brought name tags that would be part
[06:16.560 --> 06:18.200]  of the Doug Loves Movies podcast,
[06:18.200 --> 06:20.200]  you can bring, you make a name tag
[06:20.200 --> 06:21.620]  that's kind of a spoof of a movie
[06:21.620 --> 06:23.760]  and you put your name in the movie title.
[06:23.760 --> 06:27.720]  Mine has been Rasta Jeff Strikes Back,
[06:27.720 --> 06:29.680]  just because that's pretty awesome, right?
[06:29.680 --> 06:33.040]  But people that took their name tags on Saturday
[06:33.040 --> 06:35.440]  were invited to come up on stage and play a game
[06:35.440 --> 06:38.000]  with Doug and Trey and other audience members.
[06:38.000 --> 06:41.760]  And the winner of that game got to be a full guest
[06:41.760 --> 06:43.120]  on the Sunday show.
[06:43.120 --> 06:44.040]  And I'm gonna jump right to it, guys.
[06:44.040 --> 06:45.160]  No, I didn't win.
[06:45.160 --> 06:46.760]  You would have known about that all fucking ready.
[06:46.760 --> 06:48.040]  I didn't win, I didn't get to be a guest,
[06:48.040 --> 06:49.540]  but I really, really wanted to.
[06:49.540 --> 06:50.840]  But I did get to get up on stage.
[06:50.840 --> 06:52.800]  I did get to play the games with Doug and Trey
[06:52.800 --> 06:54.640]  and other contestants.
[06:54.640 --> 06:56.720]  The game is called, is it Last Man Stanton
[06:56.720 --> 06:57.900]  or is it the Leonard Maltin game?
[06:57.900 --> 06:59.280]  It's Last Man Stanton.
[06:59.800 --> 07:01.920]  The audience picks an actor or an actress
[07:01.920 --> 07:03.580]  and they picked Morgan Freeman.
[07:03.580 --> 07:04.880]  And then you just go down the line
[07:04.880 --> 07:07.040]  naming Morgan Freeman movies until you run out.
[07:07.040 --> 07:08.300]  And if it's your turn and you don't have
[07:08.300 --> 07:10.180]  a Morgan Freeman movie, you're out.
[07:10.180 --> 07:11.600]  And I got through one round.
[07:11.600 --> 07:12.440]  And if you think about it,
[07:12.440 --> 07:14.520]  there were like seven or eight people on stage.
[07:14.520 --> 07:16.480]  So that's a lot of goddamn Morgan Freeman movies
[07:16.480 --> 07:18.440]  that were listed off before it got to me.
[07:18.440 --> 07:19.560]  I got to say one.
[07:19.560 --> 07:21.960]  There's probably, that means like 14 of them got listed.
[07:21.960 --> 07:24.440]  If it was, I don't know, it was about 10, they got listed.
[07:24.440 --> 07:25.280]  And then I ran out.
[07:25.280 --> 07:27.800]  They said the two that I knew and then it was over.
[07:27.800 --> 07:30.200]  So when it came to me, I just politely said, I ran out.
[07:30.200 --> 07:31.660]  And then I walked off stage.
[07:31.660 --> 07:33.580]  But I got to be on the stage with Doug Benson,
[07:33.580 --> 07:35.040]  with Trey Gallion and with like seven
[07:35.040 --> 07:36.880]  or eight other contestants.
[07:36.880 --> 07:38.360]  Shout out to Kellen who won.
[07:38.360 --> 07:39.620]  He was a really cool guy.
[07:39.620 --> 07:41.160]  I had no hard feelings.
[07:41.160 --> 07:42.080]  I was not jealous.
[07:42.080 --> 07:43.080]  I wasn't angry.
[07:43.080 --> 07:44.800]  I was cool to see that guy up there playing
[07:44.800 --> 07:45.720]  because he was a cool dude.
[07:45.720 --> 07:46.560]  He wasn't a dickhead.
[07:46.560 --> 07:49.300]  He was just an average Joe from Wyoming.
[07:49.300 --> 07:51.260]  And it looked like he was having the time of his life.
[07:51.260 --> 07:52.840]  So I get spoiled quite often.
[07:52.840 --> 07:54.160]  So I didn't even feel bad.
[07:54.160 --> 07:56.600]  I got to sit front row for the podcast recording
[07:56.600 --> 07:58.200]  for the comedy show.
[07:58.200 --> 08:01.560]  Doug Benson asks that I don't sit front row.
[08:01.560 --> 08:02.640]  We've become friends.
[08:02.640 --> 08:03.600]  We know each other.
[08:03.600 --> 08:05.440]  And he says it's distracting to have friends
[08:05.440 --> 08:07.360]  in the front row because he just wants
[08:07.360 --> 08:09.000]  to do his comedy to me.
[08:09.000 --> 08:09.880]  And he's done it before.
[08:09.880 --> 08:11.840]  He stood in front of me and just done full bits
[08:11.840 --> 08:12.880]  and then walked away like, shit,
[08:12.880 --> 08:14.540]  I'm just talking to Rasta Jeff.
[08:14.540 --> 08:16.920]  So he asked me not to sit directly in front.
[08:16.920 --> 08:18.960]  So I have these other VIP seats at Comedy Works
[08:18.960 --> 08:21.640]  where I sit for the comedy, for the standup.
[08:21.640 --> 08:24.120]  And then when he does the podcast,
[08:24.120 --> 08:25.040]  he doesn't mind me up front
[08:25.040 --> 08:26.400]  because there's so much going on.
[08:27.200 --> 08:29.840]  So the comedy show is Doug opening,
[08:29.840 --> 08:32.560]  then Trey did a set, then Doug did a set,
[08:32.560 --> 08:35.000]  then they did the game show and I got eliminated
[08:35.000 --> 08:36.720]  and a guy named Kellen won and then it ended.
[08:36.720 --> 08:38.480]  The next day was the podcast.
[08:38.480 --> 08:40.360]  The podcast is Doug Loves Movies.
[08:40.360 --> 08:42.520]  Doug is the host and he brings three guests on.
[08:42.520 --> 08:44.120]  I already told you that one of the guests
[08:44.120 --> 08:45.320]  was the guy that won the night before.
[08:45.320 --> 08:46.140]  His name was Kellen.
[08:46.140 --> 08:46.980]  He was a cool dude.
[08:46.980 --> 08:47.800]  Shout out, Kellen, if you listen.
[08:47.800 --> 08:48.640]  I don't know if you ever will.
[08:48.640 --> 08:50.400]  That's an odd, random coincidence.
[08:50.400 --> 08:53.020]  The other two guests were Trey Galeon, obviously,
[08:53.020 --> 08:55.560]  because he traveled with Doug from the night before.
[08:55.560 --> 08:56.720]  And Todd Glass.
[08:56.720 --> 08:57.720]  I don't know if you guys are familiar
[08:57.720 --> 09:00.600]  with comedian Todd Glass, but he is hilarious.
[09:00.600 --> 09:01.760]  And there was a rumor that he had had
[09:01.760 --> 09:04.160]  a really rough night on stage the night before.
[09:04.160 --> 09:06.760]  So it was curious to see how Todd was gonna perform
[09:06.760 --> 09:08.600]  and he was really freaking hilarious.
[09:08.600 --> 09:10.400]  I was sitting directly in front of Todd Glass
[09:10.400 --> 09:11.840]  for the podcast.
[09:11.840 --> 09:13.600]  I laughed until my stomach hurt.
[09:13.600 --> 09:14.520]  It was fucking awesome.
[09:14.520 --> 09:16.640]  So the first night, Doug did stand up.
[09:16.640 --> 09:18.380]  Trey, we talked about the first night.
[09:18.380 --> 09:21.040]  The second night was the podcast.
[09:21.040 --> 09:22.520]  He brings everybody out right away.
[09:22.520 --> 09:24.280]  They give away prizes and stuff.
[09:24.280 --> 09:26.040]  They do game shows.
[09:26.040 --> 09:27.700]  That was a good time.
[09:27.700 --> 09:29.560]  There was one point when an audience member
[09:29.560 --> 09:31.040]  started yelling at Trey Galeon.
[09:31.040 --> 09:32.700]  He yelled, fuck you, Trey.
[09:32.700 --> 09:34.040]  And I don't know what brought it up.
[09:34.040 --> 09:35.600]  I ate a lot of edibles.
[09:35.600 --> 09:37.280]  You guys, I ate 300 milligrams of edibles.
[09:37.280 --> 09:38.560]  I ate 200 milligrams the first night
[09:38.560 --> 09:41.080]  and 300 the second night just to try to go in.
[09:41.080 --> 09:44.120]  And when that dude just started yelling, fuck you, Trey,
[09:44.120 --> 09:45.840]  I don't know where that came from.
[09:45.840 --> 09:48.280]  I was like, why is somebody yelling fuck you?
[09:48.280 --> 09:49.800]  And Trey yelled, fuck you, back.
[09:49.800 --> 09:51.080]  And it got intense for a couple of minutes
[09:51.080 --> 09:52.000]  and everyone started laughing.
[09:52.000 --> 09:53.280]  But then I looked to the back of the crowd like,
[09:53.280 --> 09:54.720]  who's yelling fuck you?
[09:54.720 --> 09:56.260]  And Doug Benson grabbed his mic and he goes,
[09:56.260 --> 09:58.760]  oh shit, Rasta Jeff looks concerned.
[09:58.760 --> 10:00.040]  And that really made everybody laugh.
[10:00.040 --> 10:01.380]  I thought it was pretty funny.
[10:01.380 --> 10:03.100]  I don't know if that dude thought he was gonna run
[10:03.100 --> 10:04.040]  toward the stage or what.
[10:04.040 --> 10:06.340]  And Trey's my friend and I was in the front.
[10:06.340 --> 10:08.400]  So I was like, you're not gonna make it to Trey.
[10:08.400 --> 10:10.400]  I'll stand up and block if I have to.
[10:10.400 --> 10:11.240]  But I didn't want to.
[10:11.240 --> 10:12.200]  I wasn't trying or anything.
[10:12.200 --> 10:14.480]  But it was just funny the way Doug Benson was like,
[10:14.480 --> 10:16.220]  oh shit, Rasta Jeff looks concerned.
[10:16.220 --> 10:17.120]  I wasn't concerned.
[10:17.120 --> 10:18.560]  I just wanted to know who was yelling,
[10:18.560 --> 10:20.240]  fuck you, at Comedy Works.
[10:20.240 --> 10:21.680]  And fuck you is the last thing you wanna hear
[10:21.680 --> 10:24.760]  at a comedy show, unless it's a punchline or something.
[10:24.760 --> 10:26.480]  But to balance out the fuck you,
[10:26.480 --> 10:28.800]  Todd Glass, who was hilarious all night.
[10:28.800 --> 10:31.760]  I gotta keep mentioning how hilarious Todd Glass was.
[10:31.760 --> 10:33.680]  He kept having weird chants.
[10:33.680 --> 10:36.740]  He would chant stuff like kitty, kitty, wolf, wolf,
[10:36.740 --> 10:39.160]  let's get along, meow, meow, kitty.
[10:39.160 --> 10:40.720]  And he was just weird, random.
[10:40.720 --> 10:42.100]  And so when things would get weird
[10:42.100 --> 10:43.560]  or if he would tell a joke that didn't work,
[10:43.560 --> 10:46.840]  he would just say meow, meow, wolf, wolf, let's get along.
[10:46.840 --> 10:48.720]  And everybody would chant it back at him.
[10:48.720 --> 10:50.820]  And it was stupid the first time.
[10:50.820 --> 10:52.020]  But after like the seventh time,
[10:52.020 --> 10:54.020]  you had no choice except to chant it back.
[10:54.020 --> 10:55.780]  I don't know why, I was doing it too.
[10:55.780 --> 10:58.380]  Meow, meow, wolf, wolf, let's get along.
[10:58.380 --> 11:01.500]  Meow, meow, wolf, wolf, let's get along.
[11:01.500 --> 11:03.940]  The first two times, it sounds really stupid.
[11:03.940 --> 11:06.220]  He kept doing it and I fell for it.
[11:06.220 --> 11:11.220]  All right, so yeah, Doug Benson, Trey Galleon, Todd Glass,
[11:11.380 --> 11:13.340]  and a guy named Kellen from Wyoming.
[11:13.340 --> 11:15.180]  It was a great podcast recording.
[11:15.180 --> 11:17.620]  I recommend you go listen to Doug Loves Movies
[11:17.620 --> 11:18.780]  and listen to the Denver episode.
[11:18.780 --> 11:20.500]  It's really hilarious.
[11:21.140 --> 11:23.300]  Also, I ran into the Dabbing Granny.
[11:23.300 --> 11:25.660]  I stopped at Apothecary Extracts on my way to Denver
[11:25.660 --> 11:28.100]  to get some high quality concentrates.
[11:28.100 --> 11:28.940]  And guess who was in there?
[11:28.940 --> 11:31.160]  The beautiful, the lovely Dabbing Granny.
[11:31.160 --> 11:33.060]  She was in there stocking up for the weekend.
[11:33.060 --> 11:35.460]  I kidnapped her and we went for a short little drive
[11:35.460 --> 11:36.700]  and had a nice conversation
[11:36.700 --> 11:40.220]  and shared our freshly purchased concentrates together.
[11:40.220 --> 11:41.060]  It was a great time.
[11:41.060 --> 11:42.700]  Granny, if you're listening to this podcast,
[11:42.700 --> 11:43.540]  thank you for hanging out.
[11:43.540 --> 11:44.660]  That meant a lot to me.
[11:44.660 --> 11:47.700]  I'm glad we were both able to press pause on our day
[11:47.700 --> 11:50.200]  and go spend a minute together and just talk about life.
[11:51.160 --> 11:52.840]  I needed that, kind of felt like you needed that.
[11:52.840 --> 11:55.120]  The stories we got to share were perfect.
[11:55.120 --> 11:56.560]  And Granny, I love you every day
[11:56.560 --> 11:59.040]  and I hope to get you on the podcast again soon.
[11:59.040 --> 11:59.880]  And let's just hang out,
[11:59.880 --> 12:01.160]  even if there's no microphones or anything.
[12:01.160 --> 12:02.600]  Let's get together.
[12:02.600 --> 12:05.440]  Also, I owe a huge shout out to my friend, Baker.
[12:05.440 --> 12:07.360]  Baker, I don't know if you listen to the podcast.
[12:07.360 --> 12:08.400]  I know you do occasionally.
[12:08.400 --> 12:11.380]  I don't think it's a religious thing, but dude, thank you.
[12:11.380 --> 12:12.680]  I love you every day, Baker.
[12:12.680 --> 12:13.780]  And also I want to give a huge shout out
[12:13.780 --> 12:15.720]  to all of my friends at Comedy Works.
[12:15.720 --> 12:19.760]  If you are in Denver, if you're anywhere in Colorado
[12:20.600 --> 12:22.320]  and you want to go see an amazing show,
[12:22.320 --> 12:24.240]  go to the Comedy Works webpage,
[12:24.240 --> 12:26.060]  see a comedian that you're familiar with,
[12:26.060 --> 12:27.620]  find a night that they're performing,
[12:27.620 --> 12:30.000]  and buy tickets and go to that and check it out.
[12:30.000 --> 12:31.360]  And you will laugh your ass off.
[12:31.360 --> 12:32.800]  If you've never been to a comedy show,
[12:32.800 --> 12:35.400]  it's an experience everybody should have.
[12:35.400 --> 12:36.800]  Here's a couple of heads up.
[12:37.880 --> 12:38.820]  Get there a little bit early
[12:38.820 --> 12:40.780]  because parking kind of sucks in downtown Denver.
[12:40.780 --> 12:43.200]  Park in the Ryder Square parking lot.
[12:43.200 --> 12:45.400]  Comedy Works will give you a parking validation
[12:45.400 --> 12:47.200]  that makes your parking $5.
[12:47.200 --> 12:49.200]  That's pretty damn cheap for Denver parking.
[12:49.640 --> 12:51.120]  Park in Ryder Square,
[12:51.120 --> 12:53.520]  then get there about an hour before showtime.
[12:53.520 --> 12:55.200]  Get in line.
[12:55.200 --> 12:57.360]  The doors will open about an hour before showtime.
[12:57.360 --> 12:58.920]  Get there an hour, hour and a half before showtime.
[12:58.920 --> 13:00.840]  If it's not cold, go stand outside.
[13:00.840 --> 13:01.680]  It's fun.
[13:01.680 --> 13:03.880]  You're just hanging out on 15th Street in Denver.
[13:03.880 --> 13:04.720]  Park at Ryder Square.
[13:04.720 --> 13:05.560]  Get there a little bit early.
[13:05.560 --> 13:06.380]  Go stand in line.
[13:06.380 --> 13:07.640]  Have your ID ready.
[13:07.640 --> 13:08.600]  Get your tickets.
[13:08.600 --> 13:10.540]  Get downstairs to the showroom.
[13:10.540 --> 13:12.160]  Get seated.
[13:12.160 --> 13:13.380]  Get a couple of drinks.
[13:15.600 --> 13:17.080]  Don't be upset how close you are.
[13:17.080 --> 13:18.160]  The first thing you're gonna say is,
[13:18.160 --> 13:19.800]  God damn, these seats are fucking close together.
[13:19.800 --> 13:20.680]  Yeah, it's comedy.
[13:20.680 --> 13:21.680]  It's supposed to be that way.
[13:21.680 --> 13:23.720]  Comedy needs to get trapped in that bubble.
[13:23.720 --> 13:24.840]  That's why the ceiling is low.
[13:24.840 --> 13:26.100]  That's why the seats are tight together.
[13:26.100 --> 13:28.820]  Comedy works better when everybody's compacted like that.
[13:28.820 --> 13:29.680]  You share comedy.
[13:29.680 --> 13:31.920]  Comedy, it expands.
[13:31.920 --> 13:33.800]  When it hits another person and travels backward,
[13:33.800 --> 13:34.760]  it expands a little bit.
[13:34.760 --> 13:37.160]  So that's why comedy works as tight like that.
[13:37.160 --> 13:39.280]  But then, don't heckle.
[13:39.280 --> 13:41.360]  When the lights go off and the comedian comes out
[13:41.360 --> 13:42.460]  and that mic's in his hand,
[13:42.460 --> 13:44.600]  it is your job to shut the fuck up and listen.
[13:44.600 --> 13:47.100]  Please just listen to the comedy show and laugh.
[13:47.100 --> 13:48.080]  Uncross your arms.
[13:48.920 --> 13:49.800]  If your arms are crossed, uncross them.
[13:49.800 --> 13:50.640]  Hang out.
[13:50.640 --> 13:51.520]  You're at a comedy show.
[13:51.520 --> 13:52.360]  Laugh.
[13:52.360 --> 13:53.180]  Have a good time.
[13:53.180 --> 13:55.240]  And just don't talk shit to the comedians.
[13:55.240 --> 13:58.240]  Also, the wait staff at comedy works is phenomenal.
[13:58.240 --> 14:01.080]  The service crew at comedy works is phenomenal.
[14:01.080 --> 14:03.560]  Please tip your wait staff at comedy works.
[14:03.560 --> 14:04.680]  They work their asses off
[14:04.680 --> 14:06.220]  and I love each and every one of them.
[14:06.220 --> 14:07.280]  They don't pay me to say that.
[14:07.280 --> 14:09.140]  I really have that much fun there
[14:09.140 --> 14:11.320]  where I feel like I should say that about comedy works.
[14:11.320 --> 14:14.200]  So I encourage everybody to go check out a comedy show.
[14:14.200 --> 14:15.820]  Go to the comedy works website.
[14:15.820 --> 14:17.140]  Scroll through and see.
[14:17.460 --> 14:19.420]  Just scroll through the calendar, see who's coming.
[14:19.420 --> 14:21.340]  And then you'll see a comedian that you're familiar with.
[14:21.340 --> 14:22.180]  Just go see them.
[14:22.180 --> 14:23.000]  Go check it out.
[14:23.000 --> 14:23.840]  See what it's like.
[14:23.840 --> 14:25.260]  Keep in mind there are two locations.
[14:25.260 --> 14:27.140]  I like the downtown location
[14:27.140 --> 14:29.100]  much better than the south location.
[14:29.100 --> 14:30.740]  That's my opinion.
[14:30.740 --> 14:32.240]  Wendy, thank you for everything.
[14:32.240 --> 14:34.380]  Comedy works takes amazing care of me
[14:34.380 --> 14:35.680]  and your staff is awesome.
[14:36.660 --> 14:37.500]  All right, you guys,
[14:37.500 --> 14:40.100]  that's enough bragging about my amazing weekend.
[14:40.100 --> 14:41.340]  Let's talk about cannabis.
[14:41.340 --> 14:43.540]  I was on Instagram Live earlier.
[14:43.540 --> 14:44.900]  It's where I was taking my half gram dab.
[14:44.900 --> 14:46.540]  I like to go hang out on Instagram Live
[14:46.900 --> 14:48.300]  and answer cannabis grow questions.
[14:48.300 --> 14:49.180]  People ask questions.
[14:49.180 --> 14:50.100]  We have conversation.
[14:50.100 --> 14:53.780]  We talk about random shit and I get high as giraffe pussy.
[14:53.780 --> 14:56.140]  But Instagram, I'm irie underscore genetics
[14:56.140 --> 14:57.580]  and I was doing an Instagram Live video
[14:57.580 --> 15:01.980]  and somebody asked me if I had any tips for a new grower.
[15:01.980 --> 15:03.300]  And my first tip of course was,
[15:03.300 --> 15:04.460]  yeah, listen to my podcast.
[15:04.460 --> 15:05.780]  And I pitched the show at him.
[15:05.780 --> 15:09.900]  Then my second tip was go buy and read
[15:09.900 --> 15:11.500]  a well-written cannabis book
[15:11.500 --> 15:15.860]  from a well-known grower and or cannabis author.
[15:15.900 --> 15:18.340]  Somebody like Ed Rosenthal, Jorge Cervantes,
[15:18.340 --> 15:21.540]  Drew West, Greg Green, somebody in that realm.
[15:21.540 --> 15:22.660]  Buy a cannabis book.
[15:22.660 --> 15:25.060]  So if anybody out there is thinking
[15:25.060 --> 15:27.420]  about starting a cannabis grow,
[15:27.420 --> 15:31.100]  before you buy any seeds, before you buy a clone,
[15:31.100 --> 15:32.820]  before you buy a grow light,
[15:32.820 --> 15:35.580]  before you pick which room you're going to grow in,
[15:35.580 --> 15:37.940]  the first thing you should do is go to Amazon
[15:37.940 --> 15:39.980]  and order one or two grow books,
[15:39.980 --> 15:41.580]  wait for them to come in the mail
[15:41.580 --> 15:44.360]  and then crack them open and read them cover to cover
[15:44.360 --> 15:46.880]  so that when you get your seeds or your clones,
[15:46.880 --> 15:48.640]  you know what kind of light to buy,
[15:48.640 --> 15:50.840]  you know what kind of ventilation you're gonna need.
[15:50.840 --> 15:53.720]  Do some research before you buy the seeds,
[15:53.720 --> 15:55.480]  before you buy the clones.
[15:55.480 --> 15:57.240]  I think if you're gonna have a puppy,
[15:57.240 --> 16:01.400]  you should probably go get a puppy food bowl.
[16:01.400 --> 16:02.600]  You should get a leash.
[16:02.600 --> 16:04.400]  You should have all the requirements for a puppy
[16:04.400 --> 16:05.680]  before you bring the puppy home.
[16:05.680 --> 16:06.880]  You don't wanna bring the puppy home
[16:06.880 --> 16:07.700]  and then throughout the day go,
[16:07.700 --> 16:08.800]  shit, I need a dog bowl
[16:08.800 --> 16:10.880]  and then have to drive to the dog bowl store
[16:10.880 --> 16:12.360]  and get a dog bowl and then realize later,
[16:12.360 --> 16:13.800]  should I need a leash and have to go.
[16:14.240 --> 16:17.320]  You should have all the basic necessities figured out
[16:17.320 --> 16:18.600]  before you get a puppy
[16:18.600 --> 16:21.280]  and I feel the same way about before you get plants.
[16:21.280 --> 16:23.240]  So for a new grower,
[16:23.240 --> 16:26.200]  my first advice would be to get cannabis books
[16:26.200 --> 16:28.800]  and read them, know what to expect about cannabis
[16:28.800 --> 16:31.520]  so that when you're growing and a problem pops up,
[16:31.520 --> 16:33.960]  you don't have to get on some sort of social media
[16:33.960 --> 16:35.560]  and message me immediately and go,
[16:35.560 --> 16:37.400]  hey, Rasta Jeff, what's going wrong with my plant?
[16:37.400 --> 16:38.720]  Tell me, help me, help me.
[16:38.720 --> 16:40.200]  You can look into your book and you can go,
[16:40.200 --> 16:41.920]  oh, I read about this a couple of weeks ago
[16:41.920 --> 16:43.020]  when I was pooping
[16:43.020 --> 16:45.220]  and this is probably a phosphorus deficiency,
[16:45.220 --> 16:46.620]  which is probably this
[16:46.620 --> 16:47.720]  and then you can figure it out
[16:47.720 --> 16:48.900]  because you've already read ahead
[16:48.900 --> 16:49.860]  and there's no need to panic.
[16:49.860 --> 16:50.700]  So for a new grower,
[16:50.700 --> 16:54.080]  my first advice would be get some books
[16:54.080 --> 16:56.060]  and then another piece of advice
[16:56.060 --> 16:57.820]  and I've said this before on the show,
[16:57.820 --> 17:00.700]  there's no magic bullet when it comes to growing cannabis.
[17:00.700 --> 17:02.620]  Every small piece of the puzzle
[17:02.620 --> 17:05.860]  adds up to the quality of product you have in the end.
[17:05.860 --> 17:06.980]  If you've got good lights,
[17:06.980 --> 17:08.020]  if you've got good air,
[17:08.020 --> 17:09.140]  if you've got good water,
[17:09.140 --> 17:10.200]  if you've got good soil,
[17:10.200 --> 17:11.880]  if you've got good nutrients,
[17:11.880 --> 17:13.800]  if you bottomed and pruned those plants
[17:13.800 --> 17:14.840]  and popped the stems well
[17:14.840 --> 17:15.680]  and took care,
[17:15.680 --> 17:16.840]  if you've got good genetics,
[17:16.840 --> 17:20.000]  if you took care of everything the way you needed to,
[17:20.000 --> 17:22.360]  your plants will reach their full potential
[17:22.360 --> 17:25.160]  but if you don't do everything that needs to be done,
[17:25.160 --> 17:28.080]  those plants are gonna lack in some area.
[17:28.080 --> 17:31.820]  There are a lot of pieces of the puzzle to put together
[17:31.820 --> 17:34.280]  and for each piece of that puzzle that you're missing,
[17:34.280 --> 17:36.160]  the completed picture starts to look worse.
[17:36.160 --> 17:38.040]  The potential goes down.
[17:38.040 --> 17:42.360]  So it's all about having each piece of that puzzle in place.
[17:42.360 --> 17:43.980]  It's about having the correct lighting,
[17:43.980 --> 17:45.580]  having the light, the right height,
[17:45.580 --> 17:46.800]  the right spectrum,
[17:46.800 --> 17:47.940]  having the right genetics,
[17:47.940 --> 17:48.960]  using the right soil,
[17:48.960 --> 17:50.960]  using the right amount of perlite in your soil,
[17:50.960 --> 17:52.260]  feeding the right time,
[17:52.260 --> 17:53.500]  the right pH.
[17:53.500 --> 17:55.160]  It's all about adding everything up.
[17:55.160 --> 17:57.600]  So there's no magic bullet for growing cannabis.
[17:57.600 --> 17:59.680]  There's nothing you can buy just to simplify it.
[17:59.680 --> 18:01.720]  There's no machine you can put your plant in
[18:01.720 --> 18:04.080]  that will grow it and grow the best cannabis ever.
[18:04.080 --> 18:05.720]  You have to pay attention to it.
[18:05.720 --> 18:07.120]  You have to build a proper grow room.
[18:07.120 --> 18:10.440]  You have to give it love and you just have to maintain it.
[18:10.440 --> 18:12.200]  And part of maintaining your cannabis plants
[18:12.200 --> 18:14.360]  is being there and seeing what they're doing
[18:14.360 --> 18:16.160]  because you can't time things properly
[18:16.160 --> 18:17.400]  if you don't learn the plant.
[18:17.400 --> 18:19.640]  So you have to be there and pay attention
[18:19.640 --> 18:21.040]  and learn the timing of the plant.
[18:21.040 --> 18:23.820]  And when you have to know when to do things ahead of time
[18:23.820 --> 18:25.640]  so that you can get what you want out of the plant.
[18:25.640 --> 18:27.440]  You have to have a schedule.
[18:27.440 --> 18:30.560]  You have to understand how to identify pests and problems.
[18:30.560 --> 18:34.080]  So it's a lot of pieces of a puzzle that go together
[18:34.080 --> 18:36.620]  to making the perfect grow.
[18:37.240 --> 18:38.480]  And it's surprising how quickly
[18:38.480 --> 18:40.660]  when one piece of that puzzle falls apart,
[18:40.660 --> 18:43.000]  how the whole pyramid just starts crumbling
[18:43.000 --> 18:44.920]  because you see a problem here
[18:44.920 --> 18:46.240]  and that causes a problem here
[18:46.240 --> 18:48.360]  and then a grower freaks out and wants to correct it
[18:48.360 --> 18:50.160]  and causes two more problems.
[18:50.160 --> 18:51.300]  It goes very quickly.
[18:51.300 --> 18:53.800]  So you have to get all your pieces dialed in
[18:53.800 --> 18:57.000]  and then you can get your crop to its potential.
[18:57.000 --> 18:58.600]  You guys, I feel like I've been rambling for a long time.
[18:58.600 --> 18:59.440]  I'm gonna press pause.
[18:59.440 --> 19:00.960]  I'm gonna take a drink and I'll be right back
[19:00.960 --> 19:04.560]  and we will read some listener emails.
[19:04.560 --> 19:05.520]  All right, podcast world.
[19:05.560 --> 19:07.600]  I am back and I am well hydrated.
[19:07.600 --> 19:09.280]  I have got an email from a listener
[19:09.280 --> 19:10.640]  who they did not state if they want me
[19:10.640 --> 19:12.240]  to say their name or not.
[19:12.240 --> 19:15.400]  So I will skip that part, but the subject is help me.
[19:15.400 --> 19:18.000]  And the email goes like this.
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.160]  I just wanna start by saying you have by far
[19:20.160 --> 19:22.560]  the best educational cannabis podcast.
[19:22.560 --> 19:24.660]  I listen to it every day.
[19:24.660 --> 19:25.860]  Why I am reaching out though
[19:25.860 --> 19:28.060]  is because I am having a major issue.
[19:28.060 --> 19:30.700]  I would consider myself a very experienced grower
[19:30.700 --> 19:33.020]  with over 10 years of growing under my belt
[19:33.020 --> 19:35.260]  from gorilla outdoor grows,
[19:35.260 --> 19:38.380]  light depth greenhouses and warehouse indoor.
[19:38.380 --> 19:41.180]  I have a custom salt mix using house and garden for my base
[19:41.180 --> 19:43.500]  and for additives I use liquid cool bloom,
[19:43.500 --> 19:47.700]  bud candy, Flora Delicious Plus, Bud XL and magnesium.
[19:47.700 --> 19:49.940]  No PGRs and no pesticides.
[19:49.940 --> 19:51.580]  I pH at 6.0.
[19:51.580 --> 19:52.420]  You might be a little low.
[19:52.420 --> 19:53.680]  I'd raise that to start.
[19:53.680 --> 19:56.300]  And I use Pro-Mix peat moss for my medium.
[19:56.300 --> 20:00.460]  Govita lights, temps at 77 during the day and 67 at night.
[20:00.460 --> 20:01.780]  That's good.
[20:01.780 --> 20:03.140]  Maybe a little higher but sounds good.
[20:03.140 --> 20:04.820]  Humidity at 55.
[20:04.820 --> 20:07.120]  I keep getting large amounts of seeds
[20:07.120 --> 20:11.200]  in my entire indoor grow with no males or bananas on site.
[20:11.200 --> 20:14.260]  This is not strain specific and has to be something
[20:14.260 --> 20:16.860]  with my feed regimen but it is horrible.
[20:16.860 --> 20:19.660]  I live in Northern California and recently quit my day job
[20:19.660 --> 20:23.020]  to start as a lead grower at a commercial grow
[20:23.020 --> 20:24.940]  that will be starting business in March.
[20:24.940 --> 20:26.120]  Please help me Rasta Jeff.
[20:26.120 --> 20:27.940]  This would be life changing for me.
[20:27.940 --> 20:31.320]  I am donating to your podcast as we speak.
[20:31.760 --> 20:34.440]  By donating he is talking about my Patreon campaign.
[20:34.440 --> 20:35.880]  If you're interested in contributing,
[20:35.880 --> 20:39.240]  you can go to patreon.com slash grow from your heart
[20:39.240 --> 20:40.760]  and you can make a contribution.
[20:40.760 --> 20:43.440]  Hey, thank you for the contribution over there on Patreon.
[20:43.440 --> 20:44.560]  Let's get into your email.
[20:44.560 --> 20:47.400]  There are a couple of things here that get my attention.
[20:47.400 --> 20:50.560]  First off, I would raise the pH of your feed a little bit.
[20:50.560 --> 20:52.260]  You said you pH at 6.0.
[20:52.260 --> 20:54.120]  I'd go to 6.3, maybe 6.5.
[20:54.120 --> 20:54.960]  That would help you out.
[20:54.960 --> 20:57.440]  It would make more nutrients available to your plants.
[20:57.440 --> 21:00.120]  Now, I'm getting large amounts of seeds
[21:00.120 --> 21:03.580]  in my entire indoor grow with no males or bananas on site.
[21:04.520 --> 21:06.760]  Pollen is coming from somewhere.
[21:06.760 --> 21:09.840]  It is either coming from in the room or outside of the room.
[21:09.840 --> 21:13.360]  Are you exposed to other crops that may have a male?
[21:13.360 --> 21:15.980]  Are you exposed to hemp crops that may have a male?
[21:15.980 --> 21:18.840]  Are you going anywhere that there may be male pollen
[21:18.840 --> 21:20.760]  around at any course of your grow?
[21:20.760 --> 21:22.120]  That's something to consider.
[21:22.120 --> 21:24.200]  Are you bringing pollen in?
[21:24.200 --> 21:26.600]  But most likely, this pollen is coming
[21:26.600 --> 21:28.000]  from inside of your grow.
[21:28.000 --> 21:30.080]  The seeds aren't happening without pollen.
[21:30.920 --> 21:32.920]  I would assume that this is an inside job.
[21:33.840 --> 21:35.880]  You listed off a lot of nutrients.
[21:35.880 --> 21:39.380]  And you may be overfeeding with all of that stuff in there.
[21:39.380 --> 21:40.420]  You may be doubling up.
[21:40.420 --> 21:43.000]  You're giving it Cool Bloom, Bud Candy, Floralicious Plus.
[21:43.000 --> 21:44.760]  I think those are all basically the same thing.
[21:44.760 --> 21:46.640]  I'm not familiar with those products.
[21:46.640 --> 21:47.960]  I am the Bud XL.
[21:48.960 --> 21:50.320]  That may all be the same thing.
[21:50.320 --> 21:51.880]  You may be overfeeding a little bit,
[21:51.880 --> 21:53.600]  which may be stressing the plant.
[21:53.600 --> 21:55.320]  I'm not certain on that.
[21:55.320 --> 21:57.280]  You say no PGRs, no pesticides.
[21:57.280 --> 21:59.480]  The pH you mentioned, that's too low.
[21:59.680 --> 22:01.640]  If you think you've got your nutrients dialed in,
[22:01.640 --> 22:03.460]  if you don't feel that that's the problem,
[22:03.460 --> 22:06.720]  my first guess on this would be a light leak.
[22:06.720 --> 22:08.520]  There's gotta be a light problem,
[22:08.520 --> 22:10.960]  but that would slow your growth and indicate somewhere
[22:10.960 --> 22:11.800]  that there was a problem
[22:11.800 --> 22:13.800]  and you would probably seen anters.
[22:13.800 --> 22:15.640]  But I would assume there's a light leak somewhere.
[22:15.640 --> 22:17.080]  It was probably that when I emailed you,
[22:17.080 --> 22:19.120]  I think my first guess was light leak.
[22:19.120 --> 22:22.080]  Here's what I would do to diagnose the light leak.
[22:22.080 --> 22:24.040]  I would go into the room.
[22:24.040 --> 22:27.620]  Go into the room when it is sunlight outside.
[22:27.620 --> 22:28.800]  I don't know where your grow is.
[22:28.840 --> 22:29.960]  I don't know if it's in a basement.
[22:29.960 --> 22:30.960]  I don't know if it's in the attic.
[22:30.960 --> 22:32.280]  I don't know if it's in the backyard.
[22:32.280 --> 22:33.960]  I don't know what you've got going.
[22:33.960 --> 22:37.920]  Go into the grow when there is sunshine outside
[22:37.920 --> 22:39.720]  and turn off all of your grow lights.
[22:39.720 --> 22:40.760]  Turn off every light.
[22:40.760 --> 22:41.960]  Turn off your grow lights.
[22:41.960 --> 22:44.960]  Leave all of your equipment on and just sit in that grow.
[22:44.960 --> 22:47.580]  Sit still for like five to 10 minutes
[22:47.580 --> 22:49.360]  and let your eyes adjust
[22:49.360 --> 22:51.880]  and start looking around in that grow.
[22:51.880 --> 22:53.800]  Do you see any light?
[22:53.800 --> 22:56.020]  Sometimes if you have ducted lights
[22:56.020 --> 22:57.920]  with the ducting coming from outside,
[22:57.920 --> 22:59.560]  the light will travel through the ducting
[22:59.560 --> 23:01.000]  right into your reflector
[23:01.000 --> 23:02.080]  and it'll look just like lights
[23:02.080 --> 23:04.500]  coming through your light reflector with no bulb turned on
[23:04.500 --> 23:06.880]  and that's the sunshine coming down your ducting.
[23:06.880 --> 23:08.840]  Maybe there's a piece of equipment in there
[23:08.840 --> 23:11.120]  that's got a colored light on
[23:11.120 --> 23:13.340]  that is disrupting your plant sleep cycle.
[23:13.340 --> 23:15.320]  Go in there and turn off all the lights
[23:15.320 --> 23:16.880]  and just wait a little bit.
[23:16.880 --> 23:19.400]  And if you can see your hand in front of your face,
[23:19.400 --> 23:20.800]  there's too much light in there.
[23:20.800 --> 23:23.260]  If there's light coming from the crack under the door,
[23:23.260 --> 23:25.080]  if there is any light, it's too much.
[23:25.080 --> 23:26.880]  The only light that is acceptable
[23:26.880 --> 23:28.520]  would be a green LED light.
[23:28.520 --> 23:31.400]  Like if you've got an indicator light on your CO2
[23:31.400 --> 23:33.520]  or if you've got a green indicator light
[23:33.520 --> 23:34.600]  on any of your equipment,
[23:34.600 --> 23:36.680]  green is the only acceptable light
[23:36.680 --> 23:38.440]  at this time in your grow room.
[23:38.440 --> 23:41.560]  So a green LED would be the only thing you can approve of.
[23:41.560 --> 23:42.580]  If you've got other light,
[23:42.580 --> 23:44.920]  you have to stop that light from coming in.
[23:44.920 --> 23:46.500]  Zero light means zero light.
[23:46.500 --> 23:48.760]  You want absolute total darkness.
[23:48.760 --> 23:50.120]  You don't wanna be able to see your hand
[23:50.120 --> 23:51.240]  in front of your face.
[23:51.240 --> 23:53.680]  You wanna accidentally bump your fingers on your nose
[23:53.680 --> 23:54.640]  when you reach for your face
[23:54.640 --> 23:56.240]  because you can't see your own hand.
[23:56.240 --> 23:57.780]  That's how dark you need it in there.
[23:57.780 --> 23:59.320]  So if you've got any light in there,
[23:59.320 --> 24:00.880]  it is causing a problem.
[24:00.880 --> 24:02.720]  And the plant that is getting the light,
[24:02.720 --> 24:04.080]  if it's a keyhole,
[24:04.080 --> 24:05.920]  if the light is coming in through the keyhole,
[24:05.920 --> 24:07.640]  if the light is coming in through a crack,
[24:07.640 --> 24:09.580]  the plant right there that's getting hit,
[24:09.580 --> 24:12.320]  that bud is going to herm.
[24:12.320 --> 24:14.680]  So I would suspect you've either got a light leak,
[24:14.680 --> 24:15.720]  which is causing a herm,
[24:15.720 --> 24:18.700]  or you've got a plant, which is a herm itself.
[24:18.700 --> 24:20.680]  And it's just herming out and throwing pollen
[24:20.680 --> 24:23.280]  and you have not spotted the banana.
[24:23.280 --> 24:25.280]  Sometimes when you've got a big bud,
[24:25.280 --> 24:27.320]  the bananas can be in the middle.
[24:27.320 --> 24:28.160]  Just because you've got,
[24:28.160 --> 24:29.480]  imagine you've got a stick
[24:29.480 --> 24:32.280]  and then the buds are growing up the sides of the stick.
[24:32.280 --> 24:34.560]  The banana doesn't have to grow on the outside of the bud.
[24:34.560 --> 24:36.820]  That banana could have grown on the inside of the bud.
[24:36.820 --> 24:38.640]  And by banana, you guys, I'm sorry.
[24:38.640 --> 24:40.400]  By banana, I'm saying male flower.
[24:40.400 --> 24:43.720]  I mean a male flower that pops up out of a female plant
[24:43.720 --> 24:45.580]  to indicate hermaphrodism.
[24:45.580 --> 24:48.040]  Sometimes one single male banana,
[24:48.040 --> 24:49.800]  male flower will pop out of a bud
[24:49.800 --> 24:51.720]  if it's stressed or if it's got a light leak.
[24:51.720 --> 24:54.680]  And this guy's pH is off and he's feeding a little heavy.
[24:54.680 --> 24:56.200]  And I suspect there's a light leak somewhere,
[24:56.200 --> 24:57.040]  but we're gonna send him in there
[24:57.040 --> 24:58.360]  in the dark to check on that.
[24:58.360 --> 25:00.040]  Go do that soon.
[25:00.040 --> 25:01.400]  One banana will pop up
[25:01.400 --> 25:03.220]  and it may be right up against the stick,
[25:03.220 --> 25:05.800]  not on the outside of the bud, but on the inside.
[25:05.800 --> 25:07.800]  And that pollen just takes a little bit of wind
[25:07.800 --> 25:10.200]  or you just tap in the plant this hard.
[25:10.200 --> 25:11.320]  That's all you gotta tap it.
[25:11.320 --> 25:15.320]  And pollen will trickle out and fly out.
[25:15.320 --> 25:18.440]  You may be surprised at how little pollen it takes
[25:18.440 --> 25:20.640]  to seed an entire room.
[25:20.640 --> 25:23.200]  One small branch of a hermaphroditic plant
[25:23.200 --> 25:27.240]  with like a few hermaphrodite flowers
[25:27.240 --> 25:29.800]  could decimate an entire 10 by 10 grow room.
[25:29.800 --> 25:31.920]  A four light, a six light, a nine light.
[25:31.920 --> 25:35.400]  You could ruin it with one tiny hermaphrodite plant.
[25:35.400 --> 25:40.400]  You could lightly seed an entire 16 by 16 grow room
[25:40.720 --> 25:43.360]  with one medium sized male plant.
[25:43.360 --> 25:46.120]  You could lightly seed every female in that room
[25:46.120 --> 25:47.240]  if you timed it properly.
[25:47.240 --> 25:50.760]  So if one of those plants has a hermaphrodite flower
[25:50.760 --> 25:52.000]  in there, it could be blowing up.
[25:52.000 --> 25:53.120]  And if you're not noticing it,
[25:53.960 --> 25:55.560]  it just keeps going and the fan hits the pollen
[25:55.560 --> 25:57.840]  and just spreads it all throughout the room.
[25:57.840 --> 25:59.600]  So I think you've either got a light leak
[25:59.600 --> 26:02.000]  or there's a plant that's getting overfed
[26:02.000 --> 26:03.880]  and it's becoming a hermaphrodite.
[26:03.880 --> 26:05.600]  Now there are two ways to find out
[26:05.600 --> 26:07.540]  if these are causes of your problem.
[26:07.540 --> 26:09.000]  You gotta go in there and make sure
[26:09.000 --> 26:10.440]  you've got total darkness.
[26:10.440 --> 26:11.280]  That's easy to do.
[26:11.280 --> 26:12.440]  That is a quick one.
[26:12.440 --> 26:15.520]  Now the next thing you can do is adjust your feed.
[26:15.520 --> 26:18.000]  I would research and find a brand of nutrients
[26:18.000 --> 26:19.560]  that you like and you can support.
[26:19.560 --> 26:23.080]  Then I would go print out the nutrient calculator
[26:23.920 --> 26:24.760]  off of that brand's website.
[26:24.760 --> 26:26.440]  They're gonna tell you on week one of flower,
[26:26.440 --> 26:28.960]  use this much of this bottle, this much of this bottle,
[26:28.960 --> 26:30.080]  this much of this one.
[26:30.080 --> 26:32.360]  Print that out for an entire flower cycle
[26:32.360 --> 26:33.800]  and use that fairly close.
[26:33.800 --> 26:37.900]  Maybe use it at 50 or 75% of what the recommended dosage is.
[26:37.900 --> 26:41.400]  If you do decide to reduce it, reduce everything equally.
[26:41.400 --> 26:44.920]  If you're gonna go 50%, reduce every bottle 50%.
[26:44.920 --> 26:48.840]  If you're gonna go 75%, go 75 with every bottle.
[26:48.840 --> 26:51.280]  But pick a brand and then buy the lineup.
[26:51.280 --> 26:52.700]  Try to get everything that you can
[26:53.320 --> 26:55.060]  and then feed it what it's recommended
[26:55.060 --> 26:58.300]  or just a little bit lighter and do everything else the same
[26:58.300 --> 27:00.180]  and see if you have seeds in your crop.
[27:00.180 --> 27:01.860]  Again, that's gonna take a whole crop,
[27:01.860 --> 27:04.260]  but that way you'll find out if it's your feed
[27:04.260 --> 27:06.460]  and also pH it to 63 to 65.
[27:06.460 --> 27:10.260]  Get somewhere closer to 63 or 60 is too low in my opinion.
[27:10.260 --> 27:11.860]  I think your plants would respond better
[27:11.860 --> 27:14.780]  if you brought the pH of your feeding solution up
[27:14.780 --> 27:15.600]  just a little bit.
[27:15.600 --> 27:18.320]  So I suspect you've got a hermaphrodite in there.
[27:18.320 --> 27:21.340]  I suspect it's probably caused by a light leak.
[27:21.340 --> 27:22.460]  I would recommend you go in there
[27:22.460 --> 27:24.700]  and check out the light leak and then get back to me.
[27:24.700 --> 27:27.040]  Let me know if I am right or if I am wrong
[27:27.040 --> 27:29.120]  and then I will follow up with you
[27:29.120 --> 27:30.840]  and we will read your response
[27:30.840 --> 27:33.660]  and my reply on a future episode.
[27:33.660 --> 27:34.840]  Hey, I wanna thank you for the email.
[27:34.840 --> 27:36.700]  I don't know if you want me to say your name or not,
[27:36.700 --> 27:38.380]  so if we interact again,
[27:38.380 --> 27:41.720]  please let me know if you want your name said on the podcast.
[27:41.720 --> 27:43.860]  Either way, thank you for the great email
[27:43.860 --> 27:44.940]  and let's get this figured out
[27:44.940 --> 27:47.100]  because it's gotta be frustrating growing a bunch of seeds
[27:47.100 --> 27:49.220]  when you're not trying to grow seeds.
[27:49.220 --> 27:50.300]  It's gotta be annoying.
[27:50.300 --> 27:51.580]  You guys, if you wanna send me an email,
[27:51.580 --> 27:54.820]  the email address is growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[27:54.820 --> 27:56.940]  I would love to answer your grow-related question
[27:56.940 --> 28:00.140]  or your cannabis-related question on a future episode.
[28:00.140 --> 28:02.160]  I think I've got time for one more email.
[28:02.160 --> 28:03.720]  Let's get into this one.
[28:03.720 --> 28:05.980]  It says, Preface, I'm sure you get slammed
[28:05.980 --> 28:08.460]  with emails like this, but I have to try.
[28:08.460 --> 28:10.380]  I'm not a fan of missed opportunities.
[28:10.380 --> 28:13.100]  Thanks for reading and I hope to get a response.
[28:13.100 --> 28:15.300]  Hey, I like your style.
[28:15.300 --> 28:16.620]  I'm glad that you reached out.
[28:16.620 --> 28:17.980]  Thanks for trying.
[28:17.980 --> 28:20.660]  You can't fail if you don't try, right?
[28:20.660 --> 28:21.580]  The email goes like this.
[28:21.580 --> 28:22.500]  It says, Hey, Rasta Jeff,
[28:22.500 --> 28:24.820]  I recently discovered your podcast and I love it, man.
[28:24.820 --> 28:27.340]  I just wanted to ask some advice from you.
[28:27.340 --> 28:30.460]  I'm heavily interested in getting into growing.
[28:30.460 --> 28:31.420]  I wanna learn from people
[28:31.420 --> 28:34.020]  that will instill great practices in me.
[28:34.020 --> 28:36.100]  I recently heard an episode where you spoke
[28:36.100 --> 28:37.940]  about preferring to work with people
[28:37.940 --> 28:39.780]  that will follow directions exactly,
[28:39.780 --> 28:42.340]  and those are the grows I want to be a part of.
[28:42.340 --> 28:45.740]  I want to eventually be a master grower someday.
[28:45.740 --> 28:47.220]  Well, that's a great goal
[28:47.220 --> 28:48.660]  and it's certainly a goal you can reach
[28:48.660 --> 28:49.820]  with a mindset like that.
[28:49.820 --> 28:50.660]  The email keeps going.
[28:50.660 --> 28:52.100]  It goes, Enough rambling.
[28:52.100 --> 28:54.260]  Is there any sort of advice you can give
[28:54.260 --> 28:56.340]  about reputable channels I can go through
[28:56.340 --> 28:59.100]  to get hooked up with someone legit?
[28:59.100 --> 29:00.900]  Having absolutely no experience,
[29:00.900 --> 29:03.300]  I would like to go into a legit grow
[29:03.300 --> 29:06.020]  so that I don't get gunked up with bad habits.
[29:06.020 --> 29:09.820]  Any and all advice is welcome and much appreciated.
[29:09.820 --> 29:11.260]  Bless up and stay iry.
[29:11.260 --> 29:12.220]  And then he signed his real name,
[29:12.220 --> 29:14.420]  but I don't know if he wants me to say that.
[29:14.420 --> 29:15.260]  Ah, man.
[29:15.260 --> 29:16.100]  Great email.
[29:16.100 --> 29:17.700]  I'm glad you asked this question.
[29:17.700 --> 29:20.420]  I've got a couple of things to say about this.
[29:20.420 --> 29:22.420]  First off, you're probably going to have
[29:22.420 --> 29:24.540]  to start somewhere as a trimmer.
[29:24.540 --> 29:29.540]  90% of the grows in this state hire staff as trimmers.
[29:30.740 --> 29:32.380]  Everybody starts as a trimmer
[29:32.380 --> 29:35.300]  because that's where you show if you can show up on time.
[29:35.300 --> 29:37.620]  That's where you show if you can follow instructions.
[29:37.620 --> 29:40.060]  That's where we learn if you're tolerable as a person.
[29:40.060 --> 29:42.660]  If you get along with the rest of our crew,
[29:42.660 --> 29:45.580]  starting you as a trimmer just gets you in the door
[29:45.580 --> 29:46.820]  and we need people to trim.
[29:46.820 --> 29:48.180]  We always need people to trim.
[29:48.180 --> 29:50.580]  So we find trimmers, we get you trimming,
[29:50.580 --> 29:51.420]  and then we learn you
[29:51.420 --> 29:53.740]  and we figure out where else you may be useful.
[29:53.740 --> 29:56.180]  So don't be afraid and don't feel like
[29:56.180 --> 29:59.740]  you are selling yourself short by starting as a trimmer.
[29:59.740 --> 30:02.100]  Start off as a trimmer and trim your ass off.
[30:02.100 --> 30:04.940]  I can tell by this message that you are going to be
[30:04.940 --> 30:06.860]  one of those trimmers that stands out.
[30:06.860 --> 30:08.060]  There are always a couple of trimmers
[30:08.060 --> 30:10.020]  that you know on their first week.
[30:10.020 --> 30:12.620]  When it's time to clean up, grab a broom.
[30:12.620 --> 30:14.380]  Don't have to, don't be one of the guys
[30:14.380 --> 30:15.980]  that somebody has to give you a broom.
[30:15.980 --> 30:17.500]  Be the guy that went and got two brooms
[30:17.500 --> 30:19.780]  and handed the broom to the guy that doesn't do shit.
[30:19.780 --> 30:21.260]  There's always a guy that doesn't do shit.
[30:21.260 --> 30:22.940]  There's always a guy that does extra.
[30:22.940 --> 30:25.180]  Be the guy that does extra and pass the second broom
[30:25.180 --> 30:26.740]  to the guy that doesn't do shit.
[30:26.740 --> 30:28.360]  Be the guy that gets shit started.
[30:28.360 --> 30:30.660]  Be the guy that gets shit done.
[30:30.660 --> 30:32.640]  I can tell you said you wanna learn from people
[30:32.640 --> 30:34.900]  that will instill great practices in you
[30:34.900 --> 30:35.960]  and you wanna work with people
[30:35.960 --> 30:37.820]  that follow directions exactly
[30:37.820 --> 30:40.700]  and you wanna be in those styles of grows.
[30:40.700 --> 30:43.280]  Unfortunately, you are walking into someone's grow.
[30:43.280 --> 30:45.760]  You're gonna have to do it their way.
[30:45.760 --> 30:47.840]  What you can do is do it their way
[30:47.840 --> 30:49.560]  to the best of your ability
[30:49.560 --> 30:54.440]  and do exactly what they ask for the best you can.
[30:54.440 --> 30:56.240]  And sometimes it's gonna drive you crazy
[30:56.240 --> 30:57.920]  not being able to do things your way
[30:57.920 --> 31:01.080]  but unfortunately in this industry, that's how it goes.
[31:01.080 --> 31:03.880]  So you're gonna have to suck up your pride a little bit.
[31:05.200 --> 31:07.220]  And then you say reputable channels you can go through
[31:07.220 --> 31:09.380]  to get hooked up with someone legit.
[31:09.380 --> 31:11.040]  Now I don't have any recommendations
[31:11.080 --> 31:13.560]  of facilities you could go to and apply
[31:13.560 --> 31:15.380]  or hiring services I would recommend
[31:15.380 --> 31:17.520]  where you can go and they'll find you a job.
[31:17.520 --> 31:20.800]  What I'm going to recommend is that you apply your ass off.
[31:20.800 --> 31:24.160]  Create an impressive resume, sell yourself.
[31:24.160 --> 31:26.640]  Whatever skills you've got, list them on there.
[31:26.640 --> 31:28.720]  But don't oversell yourself and don't lie
[31:28.720 --> 31:30.800]  because if you tell me you can trim two pounds a day
[31:30.800 --> 31:32.420]  and I hire you and you trim a pound a day,
[31:32.420 --> 31:33.420]  I'll fire you quickly
[31:33.420 --> 31:36.020]  because you set expectations you cannot meet.
[31:36.020 --> 31:38.720]  If you tell me you can only trim 3 quarters of a pound a day
[31:38.720 --> 31:41.600]  and I hire you and you trim 3 quarters to a pound a day,
[31:41.600 --> 31:43.520]  I'll be ecstatic because you met the goal
[31:43.520 --> 31:46.700]  you set for yourself and we can improve on you from there.
[31:46.700 --> 31:48.880]  If you can't reach the goal you bragged about,
[31:48.880 --> 31:50.320]  I'm not gonna keep you around.
[31:50.320 --> 31:53.560]  Anyhow, design a fancy impressive resume.
[31:53.560 --> 31:56.720]  Don't lie, don't embellish it, but create a resume.
[31:56.720 --> 32:00.120]  Get yourself in the door somewhere, then work your ass off.
[32:00.120 --> 32:03.160]  And with your mindset and with the way you think
[32:03.160 --> 32:04.860]  and with the letter that you sent me,
[32:04.860 --> 32:07.200]  I can tell that you're not going to be a trimmer
[32:07.200 --> 32:08.040]  for very long.
[32:08.360 --> 32:10.200]  You will be the next step really quickly.
[32:10.200 --> 32:12.720]  Then whatever is next in line, you'll be that.
[32:12.720 --> 32:14.920]  And you will be the black belt of whatever facility
[32:14.920 --> 32:17.400]  you go to before no time.
[32:17.400 --> 32:19.880]  And if you don't like the facility where you land
[32:19.880 --> 32:22.740]  in the first jump, go apply at more facilities
[32:22.740 --> 32:23.580]  while you're off.
[32:23.580 --> 32:25.920]  On your day at work, five days a week and bust your ass.
[32:25.920 --> 32:28.600]  And then on the sixth day, get up and go apply
[32:28.600 --> 32:31.360]  at as many grows and dispensaries as you can find.
[32:31.360 --> 32:33.840]  Go apply everywhere until you can find a facility
[32:33.840 --> 32:36.440]  that you like and then take over that one.
[32:36.480 --> 32:38.360]  With the mindset that you've got,
[32:38.360 --> 32:40.680]  you're not going to be stuck with an entry level position
[32:40.680 --> 32:41.520]  for very long.
[32:41.520 --> 32:43.200]  I can tell you've got a strong mind that you want
[32:43.200 --> 32:47.100]  to move forward and bosses, owners, managers,
[32:47.100 --> 32:48.320]  we see that sort of thing.
[32:48.320 --> 32:51.480]  So start where you can, get in there, kick ass,
[32:51.480 --> 32:52.820]  and then slowly work your way up.
[32:52.820 --> 32:55.940]  Honestly, I started off at, I'm the lead cultivator
[32:55.940 --> 32:58.720]  for Three Rivers and I started off there as a grow tech.
[32:58.720 --> 33:00.560]  I was hired on as grow help.
[33:00.560 --> 33:04.720]  I had ended my career with another grow a while back
[33:04.760 --> 33:06.680]  and I was taking some time and I saw that they
[33:06.680 --> 33:07.800]  were advertising and I was like,
[33:07.800 --> 33:09.920]  it'd be fun just to go dick around in a grow.
[33:09.920 --> 33:14.120]  And they hired me and then I noticed that I was,
[33:14.120 --> 33:15.400]  the diplomatic way to say it would be,
[33:15.400 --> 33:17.860]  I was probably more experienced in a grow
[33:17.860 --> 33:22.320]  than the current lead grower they had in place.
[33:22.320 --> 33:26.320]  And slowly I proved myself and I took over the position
[33:26.320 --> 33:28.360]  as lead cultivator and now I run that facility
[33:28.360 --> 33:30.280]  and the new facility that they've opened.
[33:30.280 --> 33:33.140]  So I started at the bottom of the totem pole
[33:33.140 --> 33:36.100]  and I climbed my way to the top and now I am management
[33:36.100 --> 33:38.540]  and I'm in the management meetings and I've got,
[33:38.540 --> 33:41.520]  I think there are 15 people that I'm pretty much
[33:41.520 --> 33:43.060]  responsible for all day.
[33:43.060 --> 33:45.580]  So yeah, start where you can and work your way up.
[33:45.580 --> 33:48.080]  That's one of my biggest pieces of advice.
[33:48.080 --> 33:50.320]  And now I said that I didn't have recommendations
[33:50.320 --> 33:52.100]  for places to go, but there are a few places
[33:52.100 --> 33:55.860]  that I do like and I know that they do things the right way.
[33:55.860 --> 33:59.020]  The first one I would recommend is the House of Dankness,
[33:59.020 --> 34:00.340]  Rare Dankness with Scott Reach.
[34:00.340 --> 34:01.500]  They do things well.
[34:01.540 --> 34:03.580]  A Cut Above does things very well.
[34:03.580 --> 34:05.620]  Kind Love does things very well.
[34:05.620 --> 34:06.460]  Those are just three.
[34:06.460 --> 34:07.660]  I like to do things in groups of three.
[34:07.660 --> 34:11.140]  So those are three that I may recommend that you check out.
[34:11.140 --> 34:12.620]  Now here's another thing I wanna touch on.
[34:12.620 --> 34:16.000]  You said you have absolutely no experience.
[34:16.000 --> 34:17.660]  That sounds like a bad thing to a lot of people,
[34:17.660 --> 34:20.900]  but to myself, I like that because I can hire you
[34:20.900 --> 34:23.220]  and I can train you to be the grower that I need
[34:23.220 --> 34:25.060]  instead of the grower that you already are
[34:25.060 --> 34:27.800]  with bad habits and problems.
[34:27.800 --> 34:31.040]  So if you get an interview, make sure you let the person
[34:31.580 --> 34:33.600]  that interviews you know that you don't have any experience,
[34:33.600 --> 34:36.400]  but you are eager to learn and you're eager to learn
[34:36.400 --> 34:39.020]  how to do it the way that it is done in that facility.
[34:39.020 --> 34:41.640]  One of the most frustrating things for me as a person
[34:41.640 --> 34:43.960]  that hires people and then has to work with them,
[34:43.960 --> 34:45.640]  it's so funny because people in interviews
[34:45.640 --> 34:46.920]  are not the fucking people that show up
[34:46.920 --> 34:47.980]  for the first day of work.
[34:47.980 --> 34:49.840]  It's never the same person, rarely.
[34:49.840 --> 34:51.780]  Maybe two out of 10 times you interview somebody
[34:51.780 --> 34:54.160]  and that person comes back for work the first day.
[34:54.160 --> 34:57.360]  It's really rare, but it's really frustrating
[34:57.360 --> 34:59.240]  to hire somebody that you think is gonna help you
[34:59.240 --> 35:01.480]  in your grow and they spend the first week
[35:01.480 --> 35:04.160]  of their employment teaching you what you're doing wrong
[35:04.160 --> 35:06.680]  in your grow when they're running a small grow
[35:06.680 --> 35:10.140]  and they have no experience in the environment
[35:10.140 --> 35:11.240]  that they are now in.
[35:11.240 --> 35:13.440]  It's super frustrating and it happens often
[35:13.440 --> 35:15.000]  in a large facility.
[35:15.000 --> 35:16.080]  So don't be that guy.
[35:16.080 --> 35:18.000]  Don't go in there trying to reinvent the wheel.
[35:18.000 --> 35:19.900]  Go in there knowing how the wheel rolls
[35:19.900 --> 35:21.860]  and just trying to be part of their wheel.
[35:21.860 --> 35:23.720]  That's my biggest advice to you.
[35:23.720 --> 35:25.080]  All right, hey, I wanna say thanks again
[35:25.080 --> 35:26.800]  for the great email.
[35:26.800 --> 35:28.240]  I'm not sure if you want your name read,
[35:28.240 --> 35:29.800]  so I'm gonna keep that private.
[35:29.800 --> 35:31.920]  In the future, if people wanna send me emails,
[35:31.920 --> 35:33.860]  I would appreciate it if you let me know
[35:33.860 --> 35:36.320]  if you'd like me to read your name or keep you anonymous.
[35:36.320 --> 35:37.880]  That would help us both out.
[35:37.880 --> 35:40.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, I would love to hear from you.
