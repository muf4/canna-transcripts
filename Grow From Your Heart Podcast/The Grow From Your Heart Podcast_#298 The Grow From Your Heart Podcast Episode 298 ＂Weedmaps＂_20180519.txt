[00:02.300 --> 00:05.260]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:05.260 --> 00:08.500]  It's time for a Thursday episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:08.500 --> 00:12.340]  I like to call these Thursday episodes the Thursday Quickie.
[00:12.340 --> 00:15.540]  These quickies are brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Bank.
[00:15.540 --> 00:17.740]  Make sure you check them out at dankseed.store.
[00:17.740 --> 00:22.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, it won't be a quickie unless we get started right away, so let's
[00:22.420 --> 00:26.620]  get on with the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:26.620 --> 00:31.020]  All right, podcast world, thanks again for joining me for a quickie Thursday episode.
[00:31.020 --> 00:33.700]  I like to start these episodes by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[00:33.700 --> 00:37.900]  Today, I've been taking dabs of cantaloupe haze, live batter from our friends at the
[00:37.900 --> 00:38.900]  Garden of Whedon.
[00:38.900 --> 00:42.580]  I've also been smoking some of the Skywalker batter.
[00:42.580 --> 00:44.060]  Let's talk about this cantaloupe haze.
[00:44.060 --> 00:47.060]  It has got a super golden texture.
[00:47.060 --> 00:51.460]  It looks like a slab of hard butter sitting on a piece of parchment paper.
[00:51.460 --> 00:56.380]  It smells like the rind of a cantaloupe.
[00:56.380 --> 00:59.280]  It smells like you ate a little too close to the edge of a cantaloupe, but I really
[00:59.280 --> 01:01.060]  enjoy it and I think it's delicious.
[01:01.060 --> 01:05.160]  It's got a super great head high and it's almost gone and I'm going to be sad when that
[01:05.160 --> 01:06.160]  happens.
[01:06.160 --> 01:09.040]  So shout out to my friends at the Garden of Whedon for the great concentrates.
[01:09.040 --> 01:10.040]  Let's get on with the show.
[01:10.040 --> 01:14.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you are a cannabis consumer, you're probably familiar with the
[01:14.240 --> 01:17.720]  website or the application known as Weedmaps.
[01:17.720 --> 01:22.900]  Weedmaps is an app that you can go to and you can find what cannabis products are available
[01:22.900 --> 01:24.960]  in your local dispensaries.
[01:24.960 --> 01:27.920]  So sometimes I want to drive to Apothecary.
[01:27.920 --> 01:29.560]  It's about 45 minutes away.
[01:29.560 --> 01:31.880]  I'd like to see what they've got before I drive up there.
[01:31.880 --> 01:34.720]  I simply open up the Weedmaps application on my phone.
[01:34.720 --> 01:37.040]  I search for Apothecary in the search bar.
[01:37.040 --> 01:40.480]  It shows me brands, products, a whole bunch of other stuff.
[01:40.480 --> 01:41.640]  Then it shows you storefronts.
[01:41.640 --> 01:42.680]  I click on storefronts.
[01:42.680 --> 01:45.760]  It takes me right to the Apothecary storefront.
[01:45.760 --> 01:47.400]  I click on the storefront part.
[01:47.400 --> 01:52.000]  Then it takes me to their menu and I'm able to see what is available at Apothecary.
[01:52.000 --> 01:53.960]  A lot of the places do not list the pricing.
[01:53.960 --> 01:58.560]  However, they list what's available and the breakdown of availability in weight.
[01:58.560 --> 02:04.200]  Like how much or if half a gram is available, a gram, an eighth, a quarter, whatever increments
[02:04.200 --> 02:05.200]  they're selling it.
[02:05.200 --> 02:06.680]  They usually let you know what's available.
[02:06.680 --> 02:10.440]  So I like to look at the map before I drive up to Apothecary and make sure they've got
[02:10.440 --> 02:14.840]  something I'm shopping for before I waste my time and go up there and it's just things
[02:14.840 --> 02:15.840]  I'm not interested in.
[02:15.840 --> 02:18.120]  They've always got something I want, but I like to make sure.
[02:18.120 --> 02:20.620]  So a lot of people are looking for specific things.
[02:20.620 --> 02:24.340]  You can go in Weedmaps and you can go in the search bar and you can type in whatever
[02:24.340 --> 02:25.700]  product you're looking for.
[02:25.700 --> 02:27.480]  Perhaps you want Lemon Jeffery flowers.
[02:27.480 --> 02:31.060]  You can type in your area code or your zip code and you can type in Lemon Jeffery and
[02:31.060 --> 02:33.940]  it'll search for Lemon Jeffery products for you in your area.
[02:33.940 --> 02:38.860]  Then you can drive to that dispensary and get the Lemon Jeffery flowers you desire.
[02:38.860 --> 02:43.340]  This system has worked pretty well in theory as long as all of the dispensaries update
[02:43.340 --> 02:44.340]  their inventory.
[02:44.340 --> 02:46.780]  That way people don't drive there thinking there's something there in stock that they
[02:46.780 --> 02:47.780]  don't have.
[02:47.780 --> 02:50.300]  Now, Weedmaps has been all over the nation.
[02:50.300 --> 02:53.580]  They're in every state that's got recreational or medical marijuana.
[02:53.580 --> 02:58.700]  And everything has gone well until recently when California decided to start legalizing
[02:58.700 --> 02:59.700]  cannabis.
[02:59.700 --> 03:02.740]  Now, I've got an article here from the LA Times that I'd like to share with you.
[03:02.740 --> 03:07.100]  And the headline says, California's battle with Weedmaps shows the growing pains of legalization.
[03:07.100 --> 03:09.020]  And I'm going to read the article.
[03:09.020 --> 03:13.340]  And it was written by, let me give somebody credit here, the Times editorial board.
[03:13.340 --> 03:14.340]  It doesn't have a name.
[03:14.340 --> 03:18.460]  It says written by the Times editorial board and no specific author.
[03:18.460 --> 03:20.220]  So shout out to the author.
[03:20.220 --> 03:22.140]  It goes like this.
[03:50.220 --> 04:14.860]  So let me give you guys a little bit of an update.
[04:14.860 --> 04:19.580]  In California, they just rolled out their legalization of recreational cannabis.
[04:19.620 --> 04:24.740]  They are issuing licenses to stores, but they are doing it very slowly.
[04:24.740 --> 04:30.140]  So a lot of the businesses that exist in California, the dispensaries, are not licensed.
[04:30.140 --> 04:33.140]  And they are still awaiting licensing.
[04:33.140 --> 04:36.580]  But California's fucking with them and dragging it out and not going to give them licensing
[04:36.580 --> 04:38.260]  so they can cause problems.
[04:38.260 --> 04:41.860]  Now, they're saying that the dispensaries that are advertising on Weedmaps that are
[04:41.860 --> 04:44.620]  not licensed is where the problem comes in.
[04:44.620 --> 04:47.340]  They say that they are.
[04:47.340 --> 04:51.420]  There's a state law that bars websites from publishing a cannabis business advertisement
[04:51.420 --> 04:54.100]  if it does not display a license number.
[04:54.100 --> 04:58.820]  So on their website, you can clearly go see products from many dispensaries and none of
[04:58.820 --> 05:01.180]  them have a license number.
[05:01.180 --> 05:03.660]  So I'm going to keep going with the article and it goes like this.
[05:03.660 --> 05:08.140]  The warning letter was part of a broader crackdown launched after licensed retailers complained
[05:08.140 --> 05:12.280]  that they were being undercut by unlicensed ones that didn't pay the state's hefty fees
[05:12.280 --> 05:13.460]  and taxes.
[05:13.460 --> 05:18.460]  The Bureau sent 900 warning letters to marijuana shops suspected of operating without state
[05:18.460 --> 05:20.820]  licenses January 1st.
[05:20.820 --> 05:26.220]  Many of those illegal shops, ironically, were found on Weedmaps, state officials said.
[05:26.220 --> 05:30.140]  Weedmaps responded this week with a letter to Lori Ajax, the Bureau's chief.
[05:30.140 --> 05:34.380]  The company argues that it's an interactive computer service that cannot be held liable
[05:34.380 --> 05:39.420]  for the behavior of its users under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.
[05:39.420 --> 05:44.220]  This federal law has been vital to the development of online startups that rely on user-generated
[05:44.220 --> 05:48.940]  content such as the ones that grew up to become Twitter, Craigslist, and Facebook.
[05:48.940 --> 05:56.460]  And it very well may shield Weedmaps and its competitors from state rules on advertisements.
[05:56.460 --> 06:00.960]  Now they're trying to say that since the reviews are compiled from users and the data is put
[06:00.960 --> 06:06.300]  in from dispensaries that Weedmaps is not the one responsible for it and they are not
[06:06.300 --> 06:08.200]  part of that rule.
[06:08.200 --> 06:11.160]  The article keeps going and it goes like this.
[06:11.160 --> 06:14.840]  Just because the state may not be able to compel Weedmaps to take down illegal listings,
[06:14.840 --> 06:19.380]  however that doesn't mean the company shouldn't do it as a good corporate citizen and supporter
[06:19.380 --> 06:21.160]  of Proposition 64.
[06:21.160 --> 06:26.440]  In fact, Weedmaps executives said they will banish unlicensed pot shops from the site
[06:26.440 --> 06:27.440]  eventually.
[06:27.440 --> 06:31.440]  Sorry, Weedmaps, eventually just doesn't cut it.
[06:31.440 --> 06:36.200]  The dilemma here is that California is experiencing the growing pains of transitioning its marijuana
[06:36.200 --> 06:41.960]  businesses from a largely uncontrolled, unchecked, and underground industry into a highly regulated
[06:41.960 --> 06:46.420]  tax-paying marketplace, although it remains illegal under federal law.
[06:46.420 --> 06:48.440]  This was never going to be an easy process.
[06:48.440 --> 06:54.300]  Los Angeles alone had hundreds, perhaps well over a thousand, medical marijuana dispensaries.
[06:54.300 --> 06:58.680]  The vast majority of them unauthorized, plus growers, manufacturers, and other cannabis
[06:58.680 --> 07:04.280]  businesses that were operating prior to the passage of Prop 64 in November 2016 legalizing
[07:04.280 --> 07:05.840]  recreational use.
[07:05.840 --> 07:10.040]  The ballot measure gave cities and the state roughly a year to develop regulations and
[07:10.040 --> 07:18.360]  a licensing regime before commercial recreation cannabis sales could officially begin on January 1st.
[07:18.360 --> 07:22.240]  Weedmaps contends that it's too soon to begin cracking down on unlicensed pot shops,
[07:22.240 --> 07:26.520]  many of which have been operating, legitimately or not, as medical marijuana dispensaries
[07:26.520 --> 07:27.720]  for years.
[07:27.720 --> 07:31.480]  These businesses often want to join the legal market for recreational pot, but they are
[07:31.480 --> 07:35.880]  located in cities that are still developing regulations or have delayed licensing.
[07:35.880 --> 07:40.040]  Others are based in cities that continue to ban recreational sales, which local governments
[07:40.040 --> 07:42.960]  are allowed to do under Prop 64.
[07:42.960 --> 07:44.600]  Here's where Weedmaps is right.
[07:44.600 --> 07:49.220]  California should be making it easy, and as easy as possible, for legitimate operators
[07:49.220 --> 07:50.560]  to get licensed.
[07:50.560 --> 07:54.900]  Simply forcing Weedmaps to remove listings of unlicensed operators won't magically
[07:54.900 --> 07:59.160]  diminish the black market if the legal market isn't big enough to meet demand.
[07:59.160 --> 08:04.120]  But at the same time, Weedmaps is helping to extend the life of unlawful operators and
[08:04.120 --> 08:08.800]  hurting the businesses that have gone through the expense of getting licensed.
[08:08.800 --> 08:11.840]  That ultimately impedes the effort to clean up the industry.
[08:11.840 --> 08:16.040]  That's why one of Weedmaps' competitors, Leafly, announced last month that it was removing
[08:16.040 --> 08:20.920]  listings for unlicensed businesses from its pot shop finding website.
[08:20.920 --> 08:25.700]  Weedmaps and others in the cannabis industry have recognized that they have a vital role
[08:25.700 --> 08:30.180]  in helping California tame the wild west marijuana market into the regulated industry
[08:30.180 --> 08:32.100]  envisioned by Prop 64.
[08:32.100 --> 08:35.180]  The sooner they do, the better.
[08:35.180 --> 08:39.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, that article was from the LATimes.com.
[08:39.460 --> 08:41.480]  Now there are a couple of things I want to touch on here.
[08:41.480 --> 08:45.740]  One thing I find ironic, these illegal pot shops that are advertising on Weedmaps are
[08:45.740 --> 08:49.440]  being discovered by authorities on Weedmaps.
[08:49.440 --> 08:51.540]  So they're kind of snitching on themselves.
[08:51.540 --> 08:56.380]  All you have to do is go to Weedmaps, pull up a list of dispensaries in your area, and
[08:56.380 --> 08:58.860]  then pull up a list of licensed dispensaries in your area.
[08:58.860 --> 09:02.140]  And anybody that's not on that licensed list, you just drive to them and fucking raid them.
[09:02.140 --> 09:04.340]  So they're asking for trouble doing it that way.
[09:04.340 --> 09:06.940]  They're kind of dry snitching on themselves doing it that way.
[09:06.940 --> 09:10.500]  But I guess if it gets business and traffic in, maybe it's worth it.
[09:10.500 --> 09:15.780]  And then also, I applaud Weedmaps for sticking up for these businesses that aren't able to
[09:15.780 --> 09:20.740]  get their licensing and aren't able to jump through the hoops quickly enough because California
[09:20.740 --> 09:22.500]  is part of the problem.
[09:22.500 --> 09:27.420]  When you make the rules impossible to comply with, it makes it hard to have a successful
[09:27.420 --> 09:28.420]  business.
[09:28.420 --> 09:32.900]  And Weedmaps is being compassionate and giving these small businesses the opportunity to
[09:32.900 --> 09:36.220]  get their licensing together before they pull them from the website.
[09:36.220 --> 09:39.940]  Or at least, that's what Weedmaps wants us to think.
[09:39.940 --> 09:45.100]  So big shout out to Weedmaps for first holding their ground and also for supporting the small
[09:45.100 --> 09:49.860]  dispensaries that either have not gotten their license or are just being cowboys and are
[09:49.980 --> 09:53.140]  not going to license until they're shut down.
[09:53.140 --> 09:55.820]  So that's the story of Weedmaps in California.
[09:55.820 --> 09:59.540]  I feel like that's one of many stories we're going to see with the ever-changing landscape
[09:59.540 --> 10:03.020]  of recreational and medical cannabis in the United States.
[10:03.020 --> 10:07.580]  We're going to see a lot of ancillary businesses facing weird changes.
[10:07.580 --> 10:08.900]  I think it's a great time.
[10:08.900 --> 10:11.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for hanging out for a Thursday episode.
[10:11.180 --> 10:12.180]  Let's do a couple of shout outs.
[10:12.180 --> 10:18.980]  I want to give a huge shout out to Elena Rawson, the CannaCrat, and also my friend Sammy Chonklas.
