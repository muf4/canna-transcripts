[00:00.000 --> 00:01.680]  Alright, happy Monday everybody!
[00:01.680 --> 00:06.000]  It is time for episode 481 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.000 --> 00:10.060]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[00:10.060 --> 00:15.000]  If you need new regular, feminized or autoflower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Seeds
[00:15.000 --> 00:22.840]  Here Now and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:22.840 --> 00:26.400]  You know I like to start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:26.400 --> 00:31.640]  Today I've been taking way too many dabs of Mai Tai Full Spectrum Extract from Green
[00:31.640 --> 00:32.760]  Dot Labs.
[00:32.760 --> 00:35.960]  This is a blend of Sunset Sherb and Purple Punch.
[00:35.960 --> 00:39.800]  On the package, the flavor is described as Tropical Fruit Cocktail.
[00:39.800 --> 00:43.960]  I will completely agree with the Tropical Fruit Cocktail description, but I think there
[00:43.960 --> 00:49.520]  is also a hint of something like Old Man Aftershave or Old Man Cologne that gives it sort of a
[00:49.520 --> 00:52.880]  sharp bright smell and I really enjoy it.
[00:52.880 --> 00:56.200]  I also really enjoy the buzz on the back of the container.
[00:56.200 --> 01:03.800]  It says this product contains 71.12% THC and non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[01:03.800 --> 01:09.640]  I really enjoy the flavor and I absolutely enjoy the buzz of the Mai Tai Full Spectrum
[01:09.640 --> 01:11.320]  Extract from Green Dot Labs.
[01:11.320 --> 01:14.240]  So big shout out to the crew at Green Dot.
[01:14.240 --> 01:15.460]  All right, podcast world.
[01:15.460 --> 01:17.720]  In this episode, I'm going to do a strain description.
[01:17.720 --> 01:20.960]  We're going to talk about the strain Scarlet Begonias.
[01:20.960 --> 01:26.020]  Before I get there, let's do some shout outs to a few of our friends from Patreon.
[01:26.020 --> 01:28.700]  Let's start off with a big giant shout out to Zoso J.
[01:28.700 --> 01:32.820]  How about a big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and a thank you to JM.
[01:32.820 --> 01:36.980]  Of course, I want to send a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast high five, shout out, and
[01:36.980 --> 01:39.280]  a thank you to my good buddy, Glen Geroni.
[01:39.280 --> 01:42.460]  I also want to send a big giant thank you to Victor.
[01:42.460 --> 01:46.460]  I also need to send a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to Steve F.
[01:46.460 --> 01:48.700]  I want to send a giant thank you to Brian B.
[01:48.700 --> 01:51.680]  Also, a big podcast thank you to Sephirot.
[01:51.680 --> 01:54.820]  I also want to send a big podcast high five to Aldridge.
[01:54.820 --> 01:59.940]  And last, but certainly not least, I want to send a big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast
[01:59.940 --> 02:04.020]  shout out and thank you to my friend, The Gabacho.
[02:04.020 --> 02:07.760]  Big thanks to everybody for the continued Patreon support.
[02:07.760 --> 02:10.840]  If you're not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to become

[02:18.380 --> 02:22.980]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[02:22.980 --> 02:27.040]  At the start of the show, I said I was going to do a strain review on a strain I created
[02:27.040 --> 02:28.960]  called Scarlet Begonias.
[02:28.960 --> 02:31.480]  So let's not waste too much time in this episode.
[02:31.480 --> 02:33.720]  Let's get right to a strain review.
[02:33.720 --> 02:36.440]  Let's talk about Scarlet Begonias.
[02:36.440 --> 02:37.760]  Let's do a little bit of catch up.
[02:37.760 --> 02:39.360]  Maybe people are not familiar.
[02:39.360 --> 02:42.000]  Just to get you up to speed, I am Rasta Jeff.
[02:42.000 --> 02:47.300]  I am the founder, the proprietor, and sole breeder for Iry Genetics Colorado.
[02:47.300 --> 02:50.180]  I make fine, regular, and feminized seeds.
[02:50.240 --> 02:55.360]  Most of my stuff is focused on being high THC with a lot of great, fruity, and unique
[02:55.360 --> 02:57.200]  aromas and flavors.
[02:57.200 --> 03:03.360]  I do offer feminized seeds, but in this episode, we are going to focus on regular seeds.
[03:03.360 --> 03:07.240]  I have been using a wonderful male for my male-female seeds.
[03:07.240 --> 03:10.560]  I have been using a male known as King Solomon.
[03:10.560 --> 03:13.520]  King Solomon is a select cut of a rye's.
[03:13.520 --> 03:20.080]  A rye's is a female golden goat pollinated by a male daybreaker plant.
[03:20.080 --> 03:25.100]  That female daybreaker brings a sweet, tropical, island sort of a flavor to the mix, while
[03:25.100 --> 03:29.020]  the daybreaker is chem D crossed to Joseph O.G.
[03:29.020 --> 03:34.180]  That brings a lot of gassy, cushy, sort of earthy, funky aromas to the mix.
[03:34.180 --> 03:40.500]  So a rye's brings a lot of sweet, tropical, gassy, cushy, sort of a tropical cush sort
[03:40.500 --> 03:42.400]  of a flavor and aroma.
[03:42.400 --> 03:45.040]  A rye's is known to be a very potent strain.
[03:45.040 --> 03:48.860]  I have seen many test results in the high 20s and low 30s.
[03:48.860 --> 03:53.200]  I've seen as high as 35% THC in the rye's.
[03:53.200 --> 03:57.720]  I have also seen a rye's create amazing progeny.
[03:57.720 --> 04:02.240]  Anything I use this King Solomon male on turns into magic.
[04:02.240 --> 04:06.240]  So that's a little background on the male plant that I used in the cross of Scarlet
[04:06.240 --> 04:07.240]  Begonias.
[04:07.240 --> 04:09.080]  I am using an a rye's plant.
[04:09.080 --> 04:13.000]  That is a cross of a golden goat female and a daybreaker male.
[04:13.000 --> 04:17.580]  I went through a lot of seeds to find the male that met my standards.
[04:17.580 --> 04:21.820]  The one that I chose to keep has been named King Solomon.
[04:21.820 --> 04:25.900]  So that is the male half of the Scarlet Begonias cross.
[04:25.900 --> 04:30.680]  Let's talk a little bit about the female half of this Scarlet Begonias cross.
[04:30.680 --> 04:35.920]  The female plant that I used for the cross of Scarlet Begonias was a plant known as Red
[04:35.920 --> 04:37.840]  Headed Stranger.
[04:37.840 --> 04:42.880]  I acquired my Red Headed Stranger cut from a commercial cultivation facility in Pueblo
[04:42.880 --> 04:44.700]  West, Colorado.
[04:44.700 --> 04:48.260]  I loved watching it grow because it grew giant colas.
[04:48.260 --> 04:51.660]  I loved watching it grow because it grew with great vigor.
[04:51.660 --> 04:55.300]  I loved watching it grow because it turned amazing colors.
[04:55.300 --> 05:00.020]  Then I liked watching the harvest crew attack it because it was really easy to trim.
[05:00.020 --> 05:05.420]  Then I really liked it because when the lab test came back, it always had impressive numbers.
[05:05.420 --> 05:09.120]  Then once we got it to the shelf, it always sold really quickly.
[05:09.120 --> 05:14.180]  So I knew that that Red Headed Stranger was a very special plant.
[05:14.180 --> 05:19.380]  Sometimes I would find myself adjusting my grow schedules around the Red Headed Stranger
[05:19.380 --> 05:23.060]  because it would veg so much more quickly than other plants.
[05:23.060 --> 05:26.860]  So there were many great reasons why I fell in love with the Red Headed Stranger.
[05:26.860 --> 05:30.540]  Let's talk about what the genetics of Red Headed Stranger are.
[05:30.540 --> 05:35.880]  Red Headed Stranger is a cross of Tom Hill's Haze and William's Wonder.
[05:35.880 --> 05:38.940]  So the thing that stands out to me there is the word Haze.
[05:38.940 --> 05:41.780]  We've got Haze in our genetics.
[05:41.780 --> 05:46.600]  So now let's segue into talking about what happened when I crossed the Red Headed Stranger
[05:46.600 --> 05:49.040]  to the Arise.
[05:49.040 --> 05:54.720]  Now the very first thing I noticed when I was growing Scarlet Begonias from seed the
[05:54.720 --> 05:59.140]  very first time was that these plants are hyper vigorous.
[05:59.140 --> 06:01.540]  These plants will grow very quickly.
[06:01.540 --> 06:06.280]  Generally, I veg in a six inch net pot for two or three weeks, maybe four weeks.
[06:06.280 --> 06:10.060]  Then I go to a three gallon pot and I veg there for two or three more weeks.
[06:10.060 --> 06:14.600]  I had to reduce my veg time by two weeks because these plants were trying to grow up
[06:14.600 --> 06:18.320]  into the lights and they were outgrowing the rest of the plants in the room.
[06:18.320 --> 06:22.220]  So I noticed right away that these plants have hyper vigor.
[06:22.220 --> 06:27.440]  Now another thing that became very obvious late in veg, early in flower, is that these
[06:27.440 --> 06:32.440]  plants do express quite a bit of variation in phenotype.
[06:32.440 --> 06:36.500]  Now I know that most folks like to hear that there are only one or two phenotypes available
[06:36.600 --> 06:42.280]  in a cross, but to be quite honest with you, there are a couple of very varying phenotypes
[06:42.280 --> 06:44.420]  in this cross.
[06:44.420 --> 06:49.280]  Now I know that stability and uniformity are something that growers really look for, but
[06:49.280 --> 06:55.120]  I like the offspring, the results of this cross so well that I think it is worth sifting
[06:55.120 --> 06:59.320]  through the seeds to find the phenotype that works best for you.
[06:59.320 --> 07:03.680]  Usually I talk about aromas and flavors first, but this strain deserves to talk about some
[07:03.700 --> 07:07.340]  of the phenotypes right here at the start of the strain review.
[07:07.340 --> 07:12.020]  Some of the phenotypes you will find in these Scarlet Begonias are quite tall.
[07:12.020 --> 07:14.140]  Those come from the haze.
[07:14.140 --> 07:17.900]  The haze genetics really make these plants take off.
[07:17.900 --> 07:23.580]  But on the opposite side of that spectrum, you will find some very short, very squat,
[07:23.580 --> 07:24.940]  very stout plants.
[07:24.940 --> 07:27.860]  They don't get very tall, but they do get very wide.
[07:27.860 --> 07:32.540]  I've seen these plants grown in a seven gallon pot and some of them get as wide as the seven
[07:32.560 --> 07:37.520]  gallon pot and only grew about four feet tall, while other plants in the same room in the
[07:37.520 --> 07:42.280]  same seven gallon pots were about eight feet tall and need to be bent over so they don't
[07:42.280 --> 07:43.500]  grow into the light.
[07:43.500 --> 07:47.640]  So there is some drastic variation in the phenotypes.
[07:47.640 --> 07:52.240]  And of course, some of those taller, haze dominant phenotypes are going to take much
[07:52.240 --> 07:58.560]  longer to finish than some of those shorter ChemD, Joseph OG, Romulan kind of dominant
[07:58.560 --> 08:00.160]  phenotypes.
[08:00.160 --> 08:05.220]  Some of those phenotypes that are shorter and squattier finish around eight weeks.
[08:05.220 --> 08:10.900]  Some of the taller phenotypes can finish around 10 or as long as 11 weeks.
[08:10.900 --> 08:17.860]  In most cases, you are going to find phenotypes that typically finish around nine weeks, but
[08:17.860 --> 08:23.140]  there will be outliers that finish at the end of week seven, and there will be outliers
[08:23.140 --> 08:25.340]  that take as long as 11 weeks.
[08:25.340 --> 08:29.180]  Now, like I said earlier, I could tell that these plants were growing with hyper vigor
[08:29.200 --> 08:30.840]  early in veg.
[08:30.840 --> 08:35.480]  When I flip these plants into flower, I can tell really quickly which are going to be
[08:35.480 --> 08:41.320]  my haze dominant phenotypes and which are going to be my more squatty Romulan OG Kush
[08:41.320 --> 08:42.720]  dominant phenotypes.
[08:42.720 --> 08:48.980]  And I can certainly see the middle 50-50 phenotypes that I find to be the most desirable.
[08:48.980 --> 08:52.420]  But I think they really show which phenotypes you have got quite early.
[08:52.420 --> 08:56.580]  So if you've got one that starts bushing out, you know you've got that bushy, short, squatty
[08:56.580 --> 08:57.580]  phenotype.
[08:57.580 --> 08:59.480]  I think that one is Romulan dominant.
[08:59.480 --> 09:03.520]  If you start getting one that grows really tall as soon as you put it in flower, I think
[09:03.520 --> 09:07.000]  that one is Tom Hills haze dominant.
[09:07.000 --> 09:11.120]  If you get one that stays right in the middle and it's got a big fat purple cola right up
[09:11.120 --> 09:14.400]  the middle at the end, I think that is the 50-50 hybrid.
[09:14.400 --> 09:18.480]  That is the most desirable phenotype in my opinion.
[09:18.480 --> 09:21.640]  Let's talk a little bit more about these phenotypes.
[09:21.640 --> 09:26.360]  The shorter phenotype will, of course, flower more quickly.
[09:26.360 --> 09:31.980]  It also wants a little bit more food than these taller phenotypes.
[09:31.980 --> 09:34.020]  That shorter one is going to eat very quickly.
[09:34.020 --> 09:38.820]  It wants to take a lot of nutrients and it seems to want a little bit more cow mag.
[09:38.820 --> 09:45.040]  The taller phenotype wants less nutrients overall, but it does seem like I can feed
[09:45.040 --> 09:47.000]  it more frequently.
[09:47.000 --> 09:51.120]  But if I feed it too much at one time, it gets a little bit picky.
[09:51.120 --> 09:56.340]  If you were feeding that short, squat phenotype 100% of your nutrient mix, you may want to
[09:56.340 --> 10:02.680]  reduce that to about 75-70% for that tall, stretchier phenotype because it is going to
[10:02.680 --> 10:05.400]  want less overall nutrients.
[10:05.400 --> 10:11.640]  Now with that being said, Scarlet begonias plants do have a tendency to become nitrogen
[10:11.640 --> 10:13.200]  deficient.
[10:13.200 --> 10:16.560]  The golden goat parent is known to eat a lot of nutrients.
[10:16.560 --> 10:22.260]  I often go to a commercial facility and see golden goat visibly displaying macronutrient
[10:22.260 --> 10:23.440]  deficiencies.
[10:23.440 --> 10:26.160]  So the golden goat makes her want to eat.
[10:26.180 --> 10:28.420]  Scarlet begonias was an eater.
[10:28.420 --> 10:32.020]  In many grow environments, I would see that scarlet begonias would yellow up a little
[10:32.020 --> 10:37.020]  more early than many of the plants, which indicates she needs more nitrogen early in
[10:37.020 --> 10:38.160]  flower.
[10:38.160 --> 10:42.860]  So crossing that scarlet begonias to a golden goat dominant hybrid really brought out the
[10:42.860 --> 10:46.980]  need for nutrients in the scarlet begonias.
[10:46.980 --> 10:48.980]  Keep an eye on your scarlet begonias plants.
[10:48.980 --> 10:54.420]  If you see any yellowing late in veg or early in flower, you really need to jump on the
[10:54.420 --> 10:55.420]  nitrogen.
[10:55.680 --> 10:57.440]  Don't try to overdose it at once and feed it.
[10:57.440 --> 11:01.480]  Just slowly increase the amount of nitrogen which you are feeding the plants.
[11:01.480 --> 11:08.060]  Also you may want to consider a foliar feed if you are seeing too much yellowing too early.
[11:08.060 --> 11:10.800]  So scarlet begonias is an eater.
[11:10.800 --> 11:15.940]  The shorter, bushier phenotypes will eat more nutrients than the taller, thinner phenotypes,
[11:15.940 --> 11:19.760]  but overall this plant likes a lot of nutrients.
[11:19.760 --> 11:26.100]  One thing I have noticed, the shorter, squattier phenotypes like a lower pH than normal.
[11:26.100 --> 11:31.000]  So if you're running 6.2 most of the time, you may be able to get down to 6.0.
[11:31.000 --> 11:35.120]  The shorter, squattier phenotypes seem to like lower pH.
[11:35.120 --> 11:43.200]  They also require more CalMag and also they seem to tolerate low temperatures better than
[11:43.200 --> 11:47.800]  the taller phenotypes, which makes a lot of sense because that taller phenotype probably
[11:47.840 --> 11:52.320]  has the genetics that came from a more tropical environment.
[11:52.320 --> 11:56.660]  So it can take a little bit more heat than the shorter phenotype.
[11:56.660 --> 12:00.800]  Also that taller phenotype likes a little bit more nitrogen.
[12:00.800 --> 12:04.400]  So make sure you're beefing that one up with nitrogen so that you don't get those nitrogen
[12:04.400 --> 12:05.800]  deficiencies.
[12:05.800 --> 12:10.000]  One thing I have noticed through all grow environments with the scarlet begonias is
[12:10.000 --> 12:14.360]  that all of the phenotypes can handle more heat than most plants.
[12:14.360 --> 12:19.280]  I did say that shorter phenotype likes it colder, but it can handle high heat.
[12:19.280 --> 12:23.520]  So if you've got a high heat, high stress grow environment, scarlet begonias may work
[12:23.520 --> 12:26.400]  for you in that type of a situation.
[12:26.400 --> 12:32.720]  She also loves high amounts of CO2 augmentation throughout flower.
[12:32.720 --> 12:38.640]  You can really beef up these buds with proper feeding and augmented CO2.
[12:38.640 --> 12:42.460]  Now that brings me to another very important point.
[12:42.460 --> 12:50.680]  Make sure to have plenty of airflow in your grow room if you are growing scarlet begonias.
[12:50.680 --> 12:56.660]  These plants will produce giant buds and big buds do get the potential for problems if
[12:56.660 --> 12:58.760]  you don't have proper airflow.
[12:58.760 --> 13:00.940]  So make sure you've got proper airflow.
[13:00.940 --> 13:02.460]  Make sure you've got good fans.
[13:02.460 --> 13:04.380]  Make sure you've got good air exchange.
[13:04.380 --> 13:09.520]  Make sure you've got good VPD and hopefully you've got high CO2.
[13:09.520 --> 13:15.760]  So those are a few environmental factors that will help you dial in your scarlet begonias plants.
[13:15.760 --> 13:20.920]  Another thing I should mention is that some of these phenotypes are going to get very tall.
[13:20.920 --> 13:22.200]  I know I keep saying that.
[13:22.200 --> 13:29.320]  I can't express how tall some of these phenotypes are going to get and how quickly it can happen on you.
[13:29.320 --> 13:31.720]  Some of them may really take off.
[13:31.720 --> 13:37.240]  Some of them will double or almost triple in size throughout the flowering phase.
[13:37.240 --> 13:42.240]  So when you ask about the stretch time, some of them have the potential to triple.
[13:42.240 --> 13:43.840]  Most of them will double.
[13:43.840 --> 13:48.000]  Some do have the potential to triple their size by the time they're done.
[13:48.000 --> 13:52.640]  So if you've got a two foot tall plant, you flip it into flower, it could be six feet
[13:52.640 --> 13:54.680]  tall by the time it is done.
[13:54.680 --> 13:58.960]  So I definitely recommend some sort of a stake or a trellis system.
[13:58.960 --> 14:02.320]  You're going to need some supports for these giant plants.
[14:02.320 --> 14:06.120]  Now the shorter, squattier phenotype really likes to be topped.
[14:06.120 --> 14:10.580]  It really takes well to being topped and spread out even further like a bush.
[14:10.580 --> 14:16.200]  You can top the taller phenotype, but I've noticed it responds by getting a little bit
[14:16.200 --> 14:17.200]  stretchy.
[14:17.200 --> 14:21.840]  When you take out that main apical top, the rest of those branches really start competing
[14:21.840 --> 14:23.080]  to become the top.
[14:23.080 --> 14:25.840]  It will make the plant stretch and get really tall.
[14:25.840 --> 14:31.120]  It will work, but it will create quite a bit of recovery stretch.
[14:31.120 --> 14:36.960]  If you've got a tall, skinny phenotype that shows a lot of OG Kush traits, it will stretch
[14:36.960 --> 14:42.680]  a little bit more after a topping than the haze dominant tall phenotype of the Scarlet
[14:42.680 --> 14:43.920]  Begonias.
[14:43.920 --> 14:47.080]  Now that may sound odd to some folks who have not grown a lot of plants.
[14:47.080 --> 14:49.000]  Let me explain that a little bit better.
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.440]  OG Kush plants tend to get a little bit stretchy.
[14:52.440 --> 14:57.920]  You may find quite a bit of space between internode spacing and between bud sites.
[14:57.920 --> 15:03.760]  Haze plants will grow really tall and stretchy, but I don't find as much space between the
[15:03.760 --> 15:06.200]  nodes and the bud sites.
[15:06.200 --> 15:11.120]  You may have a Scarlet Begonias phenotype that is getting tall and stretchy, but think
[15:11.120 --> 15:15.600]  about how far apart the bud sites and what your node spacing looks like.
[15:15.600 --> 15:20.240]  That will help you determine if it is leaning more toward the OG Kush side or if it is leaning
[15:20.240 --> 15:22.880]  toward the haze side of the genetics.
[15:22.880 --> 15:27.740]  Again, the Kush is going to be further apart and the haze is going to have closer together
[15:27.740 --> 15:30.180]  internodes and bud sets.
[15:30.180 --> 15:36.140]  If you have got an OG Kush dominant phenotype, you are absolutely going to need more cow
[15:36.140 --> 15:38.880]  mag through the flowering cycle.
[15:38.880 --> 15:44.260]  If you have got the haze dominant phenotype, you may want a little bit more nitrogen early
[15:44.260 --> 15:46.340]  in the flowering cycle.
[15:46.340 --> 15:51.820]  If you've got that short, bushy, wide phenotype, feed the shit out of her and she will be completely
[15:51.820 --> 15:52.820]  happy.
[15:52.820 --> 15:56.580]  So I think that covers the grow details of Scarlet Begonias.
[15:56.580 --> 16:00.740]  Let's talk a little bit about the consumption aspect of this plant.
[16:00.740 --> 16:05.400]  What does it smell and taste like and how does it make me feel?
[16:05.400 --> 16:10.380]  Scarlet Begonias has a wonderful array of flavors and aromas.
[16:10.380 --> 16:15.740]  Some of the phenotypes will smell like green apples and green Jolly Ranchers or sour apple
[16:15.740 --> 16:16.940]  candies.
[16:16.940 --> 16:19.260]  Some of them have a hint of cinnamon.
[16:19.260 --> 16:23.540]  Some of them have a hint of sandalwood and I call that a hazy aroma.
[16:23.540 --> 16:29.260]  Some phenotypes have a hint of roses and white wine and some of them have hints of
[16:29.260 --> 16:33.040]  light dirty feet and musky earthy undertones.
[16:33.040 --> 16:39.500]  So you are more likely to find the dirty feet and funky type phenotypes on those shorter,
[16:39.500 --> 16:41.020]  squattier plants.
[16:41.020 --> 16:47.620]  You are more likely to find the green apples and Jolly Rancher type phenotypes in the taller,
[16:47.620 --> 16:48.940]  skinnier plants.
[16:48.940 --> 16:54.260]  Each phenotype is going to have green apples and kind of a hazy flavor and they'll all
[16:54.260 --> 16:57.540]  have a musky, funky sort of aroma.
[16:57.540 --> 17:02.180]  But the shorter ones are definitely going to be more of the cushy, musky side of the
[17:02.180 --> 17:07.900]  aroma and the tall, thin ones are where you're going to find those green apple, cinnamon,
[17:07.900 --> 17:10.140]  champagne sort of aromas.
[17:10.140 --> 17:15.240]  Some of the taller, really longer finishing phenotypes will develop a peppery or almost
[17:15.240 --> 17:18.920]  a spicy flavor and aroma if you let them go long enough.
[17:18.920 --> 17:20.160]  I really enjoy it.
[17:20.160 --> 17:21.900]  I think it is really unique.
[17:21.900 --> 17:28.320]  It's like a green apple or a green Jolly Rancher that you set on a jalapeno for just a second
[17:28.320 --> 17:30.160]  and got some of that zing to it.
[17:30.160 --> 17:32.840]  And I think it is a really delicious flavor.
[17:32.840 --> 17:38.800]  And I also think that that really tall phenotype with that peppery flavor packs an amazing,
[17:38.800 --> 17:40.720]  amazing head buzz.
[17:40.720 --> 17:43.280]  So most of your phenotypes are going to hold.
[17:43.320 --> 17:48.360]  I keep saying it, but green apples, kind of fruity, funky, musty feet, sandalwood.
[17:48.360 --> 17:49.680]  You'll get some roses.
[17:49.680 --> 17:52.480]  You'll get some champagne or white wine in there.
[17:52.480 --> 17:57.240]  And then some phenotypes may even hold what I have been calling a spicy apple sort of
[17:57.240 --> 17:58.240]  a flavor.
[17:58.240 --> 18:03.360]  So now let's talk about the way Scarlet Begonias makes me feel.
[18:03.360 --> 18:07.200]  I really enjoy the buzz of Scarlet Begonias.
[18:07.200 --> 18:10.240]  All of the phenotypes seem to get to my eyes.
[18:10.240 --> 18:13.320]  I get a nice eye high, a nice face buzz.
[18:13.320 --> 18:18.080]  And I don't know if that makes any sense to you, but I remember when I first started smoking
[18:18.080 --> 18:22.880]  weed, my eyes would get real heavy and I could tell they were bloody red and I could tell
[18:22.880 --> 18:24.560]  they were hard to keep open.
[18:24.560 --> 18:28.040]  And it just felt like there was weight on my eyelids and maybe my cheeks were a little
[18:28.040 --> 18:31.240]  bit pink and my forehead felt a little bit heavy.
[18:31.240 --> 18:33.880]  And Scarlet Begonias brings that feeling back.
[18:33.880 --> 18:37.920]  I feel like that has been removed from some of the new popular weed.
[18:37.920 --> 18:42.800]  I feel like I don't get that feeling as much from dabs, but when I smoke Scarlet Begonias
[18:42.800 --> 18:47.240]  flowers, something just goes across my face and makes me feel silly.
[18:47.240 --> 18:51.000]  It kind of makes me feel like I'm wearing a Zorro mask or maybe one of those Ninja Turtle
[18:51.000 --> 18:53.480]  masks, just a little mask right around my eyes.
[18:53.480 --> 18:56.120]  My face isn't hidden, but I can feel it right there on my face.
[18:56.120 --> 18:58.120]  I can feel something and it feels good.
[18:58.120 --> 18:59.120]  I enjoy it.
[18:59.120 --> 19:03.080]  It makes me remember what it was like when I first started smoking cannabis, when that
[19:03.080 --> 19:06.000]  stoned buzzy feeling used to take over.
[19:06.000 --> 19:09.520]  When you've been smoking forever, you don't get that anymore, I feel like, but Scarlet
[19:09.520 --> 19:11.120]  Begonias brings that back.
[19:11.120 --> 19:16.160]  So you get that nice eye buzz, you get stoned and it feels like as soon as you exhale, you
[19:16.160 --> 19:18.320]  can feel that stoniness come over your face.
[19:18.320 --> 19:21.880]  You like hit it, you puff and then you blow out.
[19:21.880 --> 19:25.520]  And then I just feel like, oh, like there's a little face mask, buddy.
[19:25.520 --> 19:26.520]  And it feels great.
[19:26.520 --> 19:27.880]  I really enjoy it.
[19:27.880 --> 19:32.720]  It comes on super quickly and then it has no sealing.
[19:32.720 --> 19:36.400]  I have found that there are many strains I can smoke and burn myself out on.
[19:36.400 --> 19:39.960]  If it's smoking to the max today, I can get to a limit.
[19:39.960 --> 19:42.440]  Like, well, I guess that's as high as I'm going to get today.
[19:42.440 --> 19:46.280]  You can start smoking at noon and smoke until three in the morning and you've reached a
[19:46.280 --> 19:47.280]  limit.
[19:47.280 --> 19:48.440]  You're not going to get past that.
[19:48.440 --> 19:52.380]  I feel like Scarlet Begonias can push me right to that next level.
[19:52.380 --> 19:57.920]  If I'm as stoned as I can get, Scarlet Begonias is able to push me right up to that next level,
[19:57.920 --> 20:03.120]  me over the hump so I can get even a little bit more high, a little bit more stoned.
[20:03.120 --> 20:07.080]  So if I've been at a concert all day or whatever, and then I drove home from the concert and
[20:07.080 --> 20:10.440]  been having a good time all day and now I want to smoke and go to bed, normally I just
[20:10.440 --> 20:11.920]  smoke and go, yeah, that was cool.
[20:11.920 --> 20:15.320]  Just smoked a little more, smoke a little Scarlet Begonias and I go, there you go.
[20:15.320 --> 20:16.800]  I got my buzz back.
[20:16.800 --> 20:18.680]  So I love that it's got no ceiling.
[20:18.680 --> 20:21.760]  It tends to push me right over the limit.
[20:21.760 --> 20:25.640]  Also for smokers who have been smoking a long time and they say, oh, I can smoke all the
[20:25.640 --> 20:26.640]  weed in the world.
[20:26.640 --> 20:27.840]  It doesn't do shit to me.
[20:27.880 --> 20:31.520]  There's something in the Scarlet Begonias that when those people hit it, they go, wow,
[20:31.520 --> 20:34.000]  I haven't been stoned like this in a long time.
[20:34.000 --> 20:36.360]  And I really like seeing it do that to people.
[20:36.360 --> 20:37.360]  It does it to me.
[20:37.360 --> 20:39.920]  It does it to a lot of seasoned smokers.
[20:39.920 --> 20:43.720]  So Scarlet Begonias seems to be limitless and have no ceiling.
[20:43.720 --> 20:46.160]  I feel like it goes straight to my face.
[20:46.160 --> 20:48.340]  I feel like it kind of gives me the giggles.
[20:48.340 --> 20:53.520]  But also I feel like if I go too hard, it can kind of give me a little bit of paranoia,
[20:53.520 --> 20:55.720]  which personally I kind of enjoy.
[20:55.720 --> 20:59.200]  There's something about being a little bit paranoid, a little bit bugged out, that feeling
[20:59.200 --> 21:02.320]  of everyone's looking at me and then you start getting the giggles.
[21:02.320 --> 21:03.860]  That's what comes with being stoned.
[21:03.860 --> 21:05.400]  So I kind of enjoy it.
[21:05.400 --> 21:09.800]  For a new smoker, it can probably become a little bit overwhelming.
[21:09.800 --> 21:11.760]  Scarlet Begonias can be super potent.
[21:11.760 --> 21:14.760]  So be careful if you are a new smoker.
[21:14.760 --> 21:17.800]  Start slow, see what you've grown, give it a test.
[21:17.800 --> 21:22.280]  You can always smoke a little bit more if you're not stoned enough, but you cannot unsmoke
[21:22.280 --> 21:24.960]  that joint you smoked if you're too stoned.
[21:24.960 --> 21:28.400]  So start lightly, go a little bit harder if you feel like you need to.
[21:28.400 --> 21:32.880]  There are a couple of downsides to smoking Scarlet Begonias.
[21:32.880 --> 21:37.440]  The first downside is that my eyes get fire red.
[21:37.440 --> 21:40.200]  Scarlet Begonias makes my eyes glowing red.
[21:40.200 --> 21:44.640]  I'm not sure why this strain specifically does that, but it does it more than most other
[21:44.640 --> 21:45.920]  strains.
[21:45.920 --> 21:51.200]  Scarlet Begonias also gives me the most extreme munchies.
[21:51.200 --> 21:55.080]  After I smoke Scarlet Begonias, I want to eat all of the food.
[21:55.080 --> 21:56.720]  How much food do we have?
[21:56.720 --> 21:59.400]  That's how much food I need to eat.
[21:59.400 --> 22:03.800]  Also it gives me extreme intense dry mouth.
[22:03.800 --> 22:06.360]  And I feel like the munchies and the dry mouth are related.
[22:06.360 --> 22:08.400]  There's something that brings those on together.
[22:08.400 --> 22:12.480]  They're from the same thing because all I have to do is chug a glass of water and I
[22:12.480 --> 22:15.500]  don't feel that dry mouth or that thirst anymore.
[22:15.500 --> 22:16.880]  So they're connected.
[22:16.880 --> 22:19.960]  But it makes my eyes completely devil red.
[22:19.960 --> 22:24.320]  It also makes me so hungry and it makes me so dry and thirsty.
[22:24.320 --> 22:27.500]  But those are my biggest complaints about Scarlet Begonias.
[22:27.500 --> 22:29.060]  It makes my eyes super red.
[22:29.060 --> 22:32.840]  It gives me crazy munchies and it gives me a little bit of cotton mouth.
[22:32.840 --> 22:34.120]  Not too big of a problem.
[22:34.120 --> 22:35.960]  I'm sure I can handle all of that.
[22:35.960 --> 22:38.500]  You guys, that is my report on Scarlet Begonias.
[22:38.500 --> 22:40.080]  Let me make sure I did not miss anything.
[22:40.080 --> 22:41.080]  I've got a couple of notes.
[22:41.080 --> 22:43.800]  Oh, I overlooked a couple of details.
[22:43.800 --> 22:47.000]  Scarlet Begonias will make your eyes feel squinty.
[22:47.000 --> 22:48.060]  That's a note that I wrote.
[22:48.180 --> 22:50.420]  And also I've got the words time travel.
[22:50.420 --> 22:54.940]  I feel like when I smoke Scarlet Begonias, sometimes I might time travel.
[22:54.940 --> 22:57.400]  I might smoke Scarlet Begonias at 420.
[22:57.400 --> 22:59.660]  The next thing I know, it is 6 p.m.
[22:59.660 --> 23:01.620]  I call that time travel weed.
[23:01.620 --> 23:04.460]  I need to figure out bud that makes me go backwards.
[23:04.460 --> 23:06.160]  That'll be the million dollar project.
[23:06.160 --> 23:09.580]  But for now, we're going to time travel forward when we smoke.
[23:09.580 --> 23:15.740]  The last note I've got that I skipped over is great leaf to calyx ratio, which means
[23:15.820 --> 23:19.380]  The buds are huge and there are not a lot of leaves to trim off.
[23:19.380 --> 23:23.060]  That is a great thing for any grower who doesn't want to waste time trimming.
[23:23.060 --> 23:28.360]  That is an extra great thing for anyone running a commercial cultivation facility who will
[23:28.360 --> 23:31.500]  have hours and hours of trim work to do.
[23:31.500 --> 23:36.140]  So great leaf to calyx ratio on the Scarlet Begonias.
[23:36.140 --> 23:39.500]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, that wraps up my report on Scarlet
[23:39.500 --> 23:40.500]  Begonias.

[26:54.780 --> 26:57.620]  I'll be back in just a couple of days with fresh new content.
[26:57.620 --> 27:00.700]  I want to give a giant shout out to my friend, GP Frosty.
[27:00.700 --> 27:04.300]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[27:21.340 --> 27:24.700]  Not a chill to the winner, but a dip to the air.
[27:27.700 --> 27:32.700]  From the other direction, she was called divine.
[27:33.700 --> 27:39.700]  It could be an illusion, but I might as well try, might as well try.
[27:44.700 --> 27:48.700]  She had rings on her fingers and belts on her shoes.
[27:49.140 --> 27:54.140]  And I knew without asking, she was into the blues.
[27:56.140 --> 28:01.140]  She wore scarlet bandanas tucked into her clothes.
[28:02.140 --> 28:08.140]  I knew right away she was not like other girls, other girls.
[28:13.140 --> 28:16.140]  In the thick of the evening when the dealer got rough.
[28:19.140 --> 28:22.140]  She was too packed to open and too cool to puff.
[28:25.140 --> 28:30.140]  As I picked up my matches, it was closing the door.
[28:31.140 --> 28:37.140]  I had one of those lashes, I've been there before, been there before.
[28:42.140 --> 28:45.140]  Well, I ain't no fag, but I've never been wrong.
[28:45.580 --> 28:48.580]  This devil turns out the way it does in the sun.
[28:53.580 --> 28:55.580]  Once in a while, he gets shown the light.
[28:55.580 --> 28:59.580]  In the strangest of places, you get no good advice.
[29:12.360 --> 29:16.360]  Well, there ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves.
[29:17.360 --> 29:21.360]  Her scarlet begonias are a touch of the blues.
[29:24.360 --> 29:29.360]  And there's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eyes.
[29:30.360 --> 29:36.360]  I had to learn the hard way to let her pass by, let her pass by.
[30:07.640 --> 30:11.640]  The wind in the willows played T-42.
[30:13.640 --> 30:17.640]  The sky was yellow and the sun was blue.
[30:19.640 --> 30:24.640]  Strangers stopping strangers just to shake their hand.
[30:25.640 --> 30:31.640]  Everybody's playing in the heart of old plan, heart of old plan.
[30:37.200 --> 30:41.640]  Heart of old plan.
