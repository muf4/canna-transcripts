[00:02.170 --> 00:05.370]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:05.370 --> 00:06.610]  It's time for another episode
[00:06.610 --> 00:08.330]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:08.330 --> 00:12.010]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:12.010 --> 00:13.370]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:13.370 --> 00:14.730]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:14.730 --> 00:17.050]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:17.050 --> 00:18.370]  if you're a cannabis activist
[00:18.370 --> 00:19.850]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:19.850 --> 00:21.610]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:21.610 --> 00:24.370]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:24.370 --> 00:26.330]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:26.330 --> 00:29.210]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:29.210 --> 00:31.030]  This episode of the podcast is brought to you
[00:31.030 --> 00:33.190]  by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:33.190 --> 00:34.990]  If you need new genetics for your garden,
[00:34.990 --> 00:37.590]  I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:37.590 --> 00:40.950]  You can find them at dankseed.store.
[00:40.950 --> 00:43.430]  Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat joint,
[00:43.430 --> 00:45.990]  pack up the bong, or start heating up that dab rig
[00:45.990 --> 00:47.590]  because it's time for another episode
[00:47.590 --> 00:49.390]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:55.870 --> 00:56.870]  Hey, what's up, internet world?
[00:56.870 --> 00:58.630]  It's time for episode 322
[00:58.630 --> 00:59.910]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:59.910 --> 01:01.150]  Thanks for hanging out with me.
[01:01.150 --> 01:02.390]  You know I like to start the show off
[01:02.390 --> 01:04.630]  by talking about what I've been smoking on all day.
[01:04.630 --> 01:07.550]  Today, I'm taking dabs of Rocket Fuel Ambrosia
[01:07.550 --> 01:09.830]  from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[01:09.830 --> 01:11.110]  I'm cracking open the jar now,
[01:11.110 --> 01:13.130]  and you know, I've never,
[01:13.130 --> 01:15.030]  I don't think I've ever smelled Rocket Fuel.
[01:15.030 --> 01:17.230]  I don't think I've stood next to Rocket Fuel before,
[01:17.230 --> 01:19.390]  but I imagine this could be close
[01:19.390 --> 01:20.910]  to what Rocket Fuel would smell like.
[01:20.910 --> 01:23.750]  It is gassy, it is fuel-y, it's ridiculous.
[01:23.750 --> 01:25.270]  It almost makes my eyes burn
[01:25.270 --> 01:27.590]  just a little bit in a good way.
[01:27.590 --> 01:29.570]  And when I smoke this stuff, you guys,
[01:29.570 --> 01:31.470]  it does make my brain try to fly away.
[01:31.470 --> 01:34.310]  So I think Rocket Fuel is the perfect name for this.
[01:34.990 --> 01:36.230]  It tastes great, the high is beautiful,
[01:36.230 --> 01:40.610]  and it was a perfect choice for some pre-podcast dabs.
[01:40.610 --> 01:42.670]  Before we get into the main topic of the podcast,
[01:42.670 --> 01:44.550]  I wanna talk about Stitcher.
[01:44.550 --> 01:47.630]  I'm sure a lot of people were able to listen to episode 321.
[01:47.630 --> 01:50.390]  Maybe some people haven't listened yet.
[01:50.390 --> 01:52.190]  Stitcher was having an issue
[01:52.190 --> 01:56.410]  with people being able to download episodes
[01:56.410 --> 01:58.950]  via an Android phone or device
[01:58.950 --> 02:01.410]  and using the Stitcher application.
[02:01.410 --> 02:03.070]  There was a long technical explanation
[02:03.070 --> 02:04.830]  given to me by Stitcher.
[02:04.830 --> 02:08.390]  I realized how we could fix it, and I have made corrections.
[02:08.390 --> 02:10.710]  If you were not able to listen to the show on Stitcher
[02:10.710 --> 02:12.430]  for quite a while, again, I apologize.
[02:12.430 --> 02:13.750]  I already said this in another episode,
[02:13.750 --> 02:15.590]  but I just wanna make sure that I apologize
[02:15.590 --> 02:18.330]  to everybody who was unable to hear the show.
[02:18.330 --> 02:21.390]  I understand you rely on me for your Grow updates.
[02:21.390 --> 02:23.270]  I understand a lot of people sent me emails.
[02:23.270 --> 02:25.930]  I may have read your email on an episode
[02:25.930 --> 02:28.150]  you could not even listen to.
[02:28.150 --> 02:30.610]  I've got every episode up on YouTube now.
[02:30.610 --> 02:32.870]  So if you missed anything on Stitcher,
[02:33.630 --> 02:35.190]  you can either go to the Stitcher website
[02:35.190 --> 02:36.230]  and you can listen there,
[02:36.230 --> 02:38.910]  or you can go to YouTube and you can listen there.
[02:38.910 --> 02:41.550]  And I apologize, but everything is backed up somewhere else.
[02:41.550 --> 02:43.430]  So if you missed it on the app,
[02:43.430 --> 02:45.430]  you can still listen through the Stitcher website.
[02:45.430 --> 02:47.790]  Just open a web browser, go to Stitcher,
[02:47.790 --> 02:49.350]  and you can listen to the show there.
[02:49.350 --> 02:51.190]  But you shouldn't have that problem anymore
[02:51.190 --> 02:52.870]  because I have corrected it.
[02:52.870 --> 02:55.570]  Now, my problem is that people that missed the show
[02:55.570 --> 02:57.850]  on Stitcher may have just abandoned me.
[02:57.850 --> 02:59.330]  I can tell by my Stitcher numbers
[02:59.330 --> 03:01.710]  that my audience isn't what it used to be on Stitcher,
[03:01.710 --> 03:03.590]  and I couldn't figure out what was wrong.
[03:03.590 --> 03:05.870]  People were simply not able to download the show
[03:05.870 --> 03:07.230]  so they could not listen.
[03:07.230 --> 03:09.870]  Now, maybe those people disappeared and they won't come back
[03:09.870 --> 03:12.270]  because they don't think the show is accessible.
[03:12.270 --> 03:14.930]  What would really help me out is if you guys,
[03:14.930 --> 03:17.410]  my friends and family, if you could reach out
[03:17.410 --> 03:20.990]  and maybe post a tweet or an Instagram or a Facebook post
[03:20.990 --> 03:23.190]  saying, hey, Rasta Jeff is back on Stitcher,
[03:23.190 --> 03:25.190]  or check out Rasta Jeff on Stitcher,
[03:25.190 --> 03:27.390]  and maybe just post a little link to the podcast
[03:27.390 --> 03:29.310]  or something and let everybody know
[03:29.310 --> 03:33.150]  that we're back in business and we are accessible again.
[03:33.150 --> 03:34.710]  All I really wanna do is reach out
[03:34.710 --> 03:37.190]  and let everybody that abandoned the show
[03:37.190 --> 03:38.790]  or feels like the show abandoned them,
[03:38.790 --> 03:41.210]  I wanna just let them know that I'm available,
[03:41.210 --> 03:43.470]  you can listen at work, you can pass your Mondays
[03:43.470 --> 03:45.470]  and Thursdays by with some entertainment
[03:45.470 --> 03:48.310]  and some Grow knowledge once again.
[03:48.310 --> 03:50.270]  All right, let's quit rambling about old business.
[03:50.270 --> 03:52.950]  Let's move forward.
[03:52.950 --> 03:54.550]  I may have skipped it at the start of the show,
[03:54.550 --> 03:56.030]  but I do need to give a huge shout out
[03:56.030 --> 03:57.750]  to my friends at PL Grow Systems.
[03:57.750 --> 04:00.510]  That's right, if you need a new PL Grow Minder unit
[04:00.510 --> 04:02.510]  to make sure you know the temp, humidity,
[04:02.510 --> 04:05.050]  vapor pressure deficit of your grow room,
[04:05.050 --> 04:07.850]  you can find my friends at PL Grow.Systems.
[04:07.850 --> 04:11.070]  They'll get you all set up with the PL Grow Minder unit.
[04:11.070 --> 04:13.110]  Also, if you need seeds for your garden, you guys,
[04:13.110 --> 04:16.830]  I always recommend dankseed.store.
[04:16.830 --> 04:18.830]  Dankseed.store is the place to go.
[04:18.830 --> 04:20.430]  They've got a fresh drop of Sunkiss,
[04:20.430 --> 04:22.990]  and I know they've got the strawberry Starburst in stock.
[04:22.990 --> 04:26.950]  So check out dankseed.store for all of your iRe genetics,
[04:26.950 --> 04:30.490]  feminized and regular seeds needs.
[04:31.510 --> 04:32.990]  All right guys, let's do a podcast
[04:32.990 --> 04:35.870]  all about harvesting your cannabis.
[04:35.870 --> 04:38.470]  We've done an episode about determining
[04:38.470 --> 04:40.190]  when your plants are ripe.
[04:40.190 --> 04:42.230]  We've done an episode about flushing your plants
[04:42.230 --> 04:43.270]  before harvest.
[04:43.270 --> 04:46.830]  Now it is harvest time in the garden.
[04:46.830 --> 04:48.590]  There are a couple of things we need to think about
[04:48.590 --> 04:50.950]  before we go in and cut down the plants.
[04:50.950 --> 04:52.310]  First of all, I should mention,
[04:52.310 --> 04:55.350]  if this is your first time cutting down cannabis plants,
[04:55.350 --> 04:58.630]  you thought they smelled strongly when they were growing.
[04:58.630 --> 05:00.430]  As soon as you cut those fuckers down,
[05:00.430 --> 05:01.990]  it's gonna double in smell.
[05:01.990 --> 05:03.990]  I know that sounds like I may be making it up.
[05:03.990 --> 05:05.390]  It sounds like I'm joking.
[05:05.390 --> 05:07.910]  No, it is going to stink.
[05:07.910 --> 05:10.350]  It's going to be ridiculous.
[05:10.350 --> 05:13.030]  If I grow one plant in a small house,
[05:13.870 --> 05:15.910]  we'll say in the attic or the basement,
[05:15.910 --> 05:17.750]  and then I chop that plant down
[05:17.750 --> 05:20.350]  and hang it up in that attic or basement,
[05:20.350 --> 05:21.790]  the stink of that plant,
[05:21.790 --> 05:24.270]  so normally you can smell it to the living room, right?
[05:24.510 --> 05:26.030]  To the living room of the house.
[05:26.030 --> 05:27.110]  As soon as you harvest,
[05:27.110 --> 05:29.550]  you can smell that shit to the driveway.
[05:29.550 --> 05:31.030]  I don't know the science behind that.
[05:31.030 --> 05:32.870]  I don't know if it's paranoia.
[05:32.870 --> 05:34.310]  I don't know if it's because we're moving in
[05:34.310 --> 05:35.390]  and out of the grow room more.
[05:35.390 --> 05:36.710]  I don't know exactly what it is,
[05:36.710 --> 05:39.110]  but as soon as you cut down that crop,
[05:39.110 --> 05:41.070]  it's gonna stink more than you were expecting.
[05:41.070 --> 05:42.790]  So try to be prepared for that.
[05:42.790 --> 05:45.070]  Some things you can do to be prepared
[05:45.070 --> 05:47.310]  are maybe getting some Ona gels.
[05:47.310 --> 05:49.030]  If you know what Ona gels are,
[05:49.030 --> 05:53.070]  Ona gels are jars filled with this gelatinous substance
[05:53.070 --> 05:54.230]  that just eats up odor.
[05:54.230 --> 05:55.510]  It doesn't put out an odor,
[05:55.510 --> 05:57.870]  but it eats up the odors in the room.
[05:57.870 --> 05:59.630]  So you open the jar.
[05:59.630 --> 06:02.030]  I used to just set a jar of it behind a house plant
[06:02.030 --> 06:02.870]  or behind a picture.
[06:02.870 --> 06:04.070]  You know, you got a picture of your daughter
[06:04.070 --> 06:06.070]  up on the coffee table or up on the end table.
[06:06.070 --> 06:08.670]  You just stick one of these Ona jars opened right behind it,
[06:08.670 --> 06:09.790]  and that just starts sucking up
[06:09.790 --> 06:11.190]  all the odor out of the room.
[06:11.190 --> 06:13.590]  So put those by the doors and the entryways of your house
[06:13.590 --> 06:15.190]  where people may come in,
[06:15.190 --> 06:17.270]  and that way you're sucking up that odor.
[06:17.270 --> 06:20.590]  And then also, if you can't do the Ona gels,
[06:20.590 --> 06:23.790]  maybe do something stronger to cover the smell.
[06:23.790 --> 06:24.710]  It's gonna be hard.
[06:24.710 --> 06:26.990]  Like if you're spraying Lilac Air Freshener,
[06:26.990 --> 06:28.670]  you're gonna smell Lilac and weed.
[06:28.670 --> 06:30.350]  The Ona gels are gonna be your best bet,
[06:30.350 --> 06:34.110]  something to neutralize the odor would be your best bet.
[06:34.110 --> 06:35.990]  Another good idea if you can afford it
[06:35.990 --> 06:37.950]  would be a carbon scrubber.
[06:37.950 --> 06:39.910]  Most of us have a carbon filter
[06:39.910 --> 06:41.950]  that blows air out of the grow room.
[06:41.950 --> 06:44.470]  Keep that running because that's gonna keep filtering the air
[06:44.470 --> 06:45.350]  and make it smell good,
[06:45.350 --> 06:49.990]  but also get a carbon filter with a blower on top of it
[06:49.990 --> 06:51.030]  and just plug it in
[06:51.030 --> 06:52.910]  and let that air run through the carbon filter.
[06:52.910 --> 06:55.150]  And now you're just sucking stink out of the air,
[06:55.150 --> 06:56.630]  cleaning up that environment.
[06:56.630 --> 06:58.470]  So be prepared, it's gonna stink.
[06:58.470 --> 06:59.870]  That is something we need to start with.
[06:59.870 --> 07:01.230]  It will be stinky.
[07:02.070 --> 07:03.950]  Now, before we even start chopping down,
[07:03.950 --> 07:05.910]  there's a few more things to talk about.
[07:05.910 --> 07:07.990]  Where are all of these plants going to go
[07:07.990 --> 07:09.150]  once you cut them down?
[07:09.150 --> 07:12.430]  Let's plan this before we even get to harvest time.
[07:12.430 --> 07:14.630]  Are you going to use those circular racks
[07:14.630 --> 07:15.630]  that they sell at the grow store,
[07:15.630 --> 07:17.670]  the multi-tiered circle racks?
[07:17.670 --> 07:19.470]  Are you gonna be able to make a line somewhere
[07:19.950 --> 07:20.790]  with string and hang them?
[07:20.790 --> 07:22.310]  That's what I prefer.
[07:22.310 --> 07:24.150]  Do you have a space that you're going to be able
[07:24.150 --> 07:26.630]  to control the temperature and the humidity
[07:26.630 --> 07:29.190]  and hopefully keep the aroma under control
[07:29.190 --> 07:32.390]  and hopefully keep light out and also keep people away?
[07:32.390 --> 07:36.550]  Start thinking about that around week six or seven, guys.
[07:36.550 --> 07:38.190]  Let's not wait until week nine
[07:38.190 --> 07:40.590]  to start figuring out where these plants are going.
[07:40.590 --> 07:41.990]  Start thinking about that early.
[07:41.990 --> 07:43.950]  So you need a place for them to hang,
[07:43.950 --> 07:45.510]  that you can control the temperature,
[07:45.510 --> 07:47.590]  a place you can control the humidity,
[07:47.590 --> 07:50.350]  and a place you can keep people out of there.
[07:50.350 --> 07:52.950]  And also, you're gonna have to control that aroma.
[07:52.950 --> 07:55.190]  So have a place prepared.
[07:55.190 --> 07:57.910]  And keep in mind that if you're gonna dry your buds,
[07:57.910 --> 08:00.910]  if these buds hang in your dingy, funky basement,
[08:00.910 --> 08:04.150]  they're going to taste like funky, dingy basement.
[08:04.150 --> 08:05.830]  You've tasted that smell on buds before
[08:05.830 --> 08:07.230]  and you probably didn't realize,
[08:07.230 --> 08:09.270]  why does this taste like the damn basement?
[08:09.270 --> 08:10.090]  You know why?
[08:10.090 --> 08:12.830]  Because it was dried and cured and hung for seven days
[08:12.830 --> 08:16.110]  in somebody's funky, damp, dirty fucking basement.
[08:16.110 --> 08:17.030]  That's exactly why.
[08:17.670 --> 08:20.710]  Have some air exchange, have some temperature control,
[08:20.710 --> 08:22.150]  and have a good environment, you guys.
[08:22.150 --> 08:24.010]  Create a good environment for your plants.
[08:24.010 --> 08:25.510]  You've gotten them this far.
[08:25.510 --> 08:27.190]  Let's not ruin them.
[08:27.190 --> 08:29.070]  If you're growing in a grow hut
[08:29.070 --> 08:31.910]  and you don't have another crop coming up right behind it,
[08:31.910 --> 08:34.550]  why not just use that grow hut as your drying space?
[08:34.550 --> 08:36.310]  That would not be a bad idea.
[08:36.310 --> 08:38.390]  You're controlling that environment already anyway.
[08:38.390 --> 08:40.490]  So that is always an option.
[08:40.490 --> 08:42.190]  Create a good environment, you guys.
[08:42.190 --> 08:44.190]  And we'll talk more about the space in a minute.
[08:44.190 --> 08:45.910]  You can just use the grow room if you need to.
[08:45.910 --> 08:47.390]  If you don't have another crop coming up,
[08:47.390 --> 08:49.950]  just use your flower room or move the plants into flower,
[08:49.950 --> 08:51.070]  use the bedroom.
[08:51.070 --> 08:51.910]  That's always an option.
[08:51.910 --> 08:53.630]  But we'll get back to that, don't worry, you guys.
[08:53.630 --> 08:56.270]  Let's talk more about the things we need to prepare for
[08:56.270 --> 08:58.490]  before harvest time comes.
[08:58.490 --> 09:00.690]  You're going to need a few tools.
[09:00.690 --> 09:03.430]  I highly recommend gloves.
[09:03.430 --> 09:06.190]  The black or the blue, thin nitrile gloves.
[09:06.190 --> 09:07.190]  They don't have to be super thick.
[09:07.190 --> 09:09.070]  You're just trying to not get sticky.
[09:09.070 --> 09:10.950]  You guys, when you're trimming weed
[09:10.950 --> 09:13.790]  and when you're harvesting and handling this amount of weed,
[09:13.790 --> 09:14.990]  you're gonna get sticky.
[09:14.990 --> 09:16.530]  You might wanna wear long sleeves.
[09:16.530 --> 09:18.510]  You might wanna wear just a long sleeve over shirt
[09:18.510 --> 09:20.150]  that you could take off when you're done.
[09:20.150 --> 09:21.470]  You're going to get sticky.
[09:21.470 --> 09:23.050]  You are going to stink.
[09:23.050 --> 09:26.430]  Some people have an allergy to cannabis.
[09:26.430 --> 09:28.890]  I've got a friend, if she rubs up against a blue dream plant,
[09:28.890 --> 09:31.110]  she's gonna break out into a giant rash.
[09:31.110 --> 09:32.590]  So maybe cover yourself up.
[09:32.590 --> 09:34.110]  Certainly wear gloves.
[09:34.110 --> 09:36.950]  Also, if your eye itches,
[09:36.950 --> 09:41.950]  do never rub your eye with a trichome-laden finger.
[09:41.990 --> 09:43.590]  If your eye itches and you're trimming weed,
[09:43.590 --> 09:45.870]  take off your gloves and then itch your eye
[09:45.870 --> 09:47.190]  with a clean hand.
[09:47.190 --> 09:49.610]  Or if you've been trimming and not wearing gloves,
[09:49.610 --> 09:51.510]  go wash your hands before you itch your eye
[09:51.510 --> 09:52.350]  or scratch your eye.
[09:52.350 --> 09:55.110]  Because if you get resin in your eye,
[09:55.110 --> 09:57.870]  it is one of the most painful experiences
[09:57.870 --> 09:59.470]  you will ever endure.
[09:59.470 --> 10:01.150]  It hurts and it won't stop.
[10:01.150 --> 10:02.870]  I don't know what makes it stop.
[10:02.870 --> 10:05.510]  It just burns and burns and burns and it's sticky.
[10:05.510 --> 10:07.450]  And when you blink, you expect it to feel better,
[10:07.450 --> 10:09.270]  but it's just stickier.
[10:09.270 --> 10:11.130]  It's so fucking miserable.
[10:11.130 --> 10:15.050]  So gloves, a long-sleeved shirt.
[10:15.050 --> 10:17.290]  You're also gonna need some scissors.
[10:17.290 --> 10:19.690]  I recommend quality scissors.
[10:19.690 --> 10:21.290]  You can buy some cheap, shitty scissors,
[10:21.290 --> 10:22.490]  but they're gonna break.
[10:22.490 --> 10:24.930]  I also recommend using a different pair of scissors
[10:24.930 --> 10:26.390]  for cutting down the plants
[10:26.390 --> 10:28.410]  than you use for trimming the plants.
[10:28.410 --> 10:29.610]  When you're trimming, you're getting in there
[10:29.610 --> 10:31.050]  and getting the fine details.
[10:31.050 --> 10:32.150]  When you're cutting them down,
[10:32.150 --> 10:34.650]  you're using brute force and cutting down tough plants.
[10:34.650 --> 10:37.990]  You may need some thicker pruners.
[10:37.990 --> 10:40.650]  You may need some choppers to cut down a big plant.
[10:41.170 --> 10:42.570]  I don't know how big your stalk is,
[10:42.570 --> 10:43.610]  but you wanna be able to get in there
[10:43.610 --> 10:45.490]  and cut it down easily without hurting your wrist,
[10:45.490 --> 10:47.090]  without breaking your scissors.
[10:47.090 --> 10:50.450]  So I like something that has got a metal,
[10:50.450 --> 10:52.730]  solid piece to it for cutting them down.
[10:52.730 --> 10:55.210]  Not the plastic scissors for cutting them down, metal.
[10:55.210 --> 10:58.050]  Two solid pieces of metal from the handle to the blade.
[10:58.050 --> 10:59.750]  Then also for trimming,
[10:59.750 --> 11:02.570]  that's when I like the little fiskers, the diamond tips,
[11:02.570 --> 11:03.950]  or something similar to that.
[11:03.950 --> 11:06.430]  So something to cut down the plants with.
[11:06.430 --> 11:10.250]  Scissors, shears, whatever you're gonna use, be prepared.
[11:10.850 --> 11:12.730]  And if you're gonna have more than one person
[11:12.730 --> 11:14.490]  doing the chopping down,
[11:14.490 --> 11:16.690]  get more than one fucking pair of shears.
[11:16.690 --> 11:17.790]  There's nothing more frustrating
[11:17.790 --> 11:20.290]  than watching people stand around and not able to do work
[11:20.290 --> 11:21.770]  because you don't have enough scissors
[11:21.770 --> 11:23.570]  or you don't have the right tools.
[11:23.570 --> 11:24.970]  If you're gonna have a group of people doing it,
[11:24.970 --> 11:26.570]  get a group of shears.
[11:26.570 --> 11:28.490]  I know most of you guys probably have a small garden.
[11:28.490 --> 11:29.730]  It's probably one or two of you,
[11:29.730 --> 11:32.210]  and you don't need giant bolt cutter style shears
[11:32.210 --> 11:34.450]  or giant fiskers shears or anything.
[11:34.450 --> 11:36.090]  But I've been in that situation before
[11:36.090 --> 11:37.850]  where I'm watching five guys wait for work
[11:37.850 --> 11:39.930]  because it's just me with a set of shears
[11:39.930 --> 11:41.370]  chopping down every plant.
[11:41.370 --> 11:43.990]  So have enough shears, have enough gloves,
[11:43.990 --> 11:46.210]  maybe get a few different sizes of gloves.
[11:46.210 --> 11:47.890]  If you're gonna go buy a box of gloves,
[11:47.890 --> 11:50.730]  buy two, maybe three, get small, medium, and larges,
[11:50.730 --> 11:52.570]  or maybe small, large, and extra large.
[11:52.570 --> 11:53.970]  It depends on who's coming over to help you out.
[11:53.970 --> 11:55.370]  But if you're gonna have people helping,
[11:55.370 --> 11:57.450]  if they're gonna be harvesting and trimming with you,
[11:57.450 --> 12:00.730]  maybe you want a few different size gloves.
[12:00.730 --> 12:02.190]  And here's something I should mention.
[12:02.190 --> 12:05.110]  If you have applied any pesticides to your cannabis plants
[12:05.110 --> 12:06.050]  and you're gonna cut them down
[12:06.050 --> 12:07.570]  and have other people work with them,
[12:08.290 --> 12:09.690]  maybe you should politely let those people know
[12:09.690 --> 12:11.810]  what pesticides were applied to your plants
[12:11.810 --> 12:14.130]  so that they can wear long sleeves, they can wear a mask,
[12:14.130 --> 12:17.010]  they can dress appropriately based on their decisions,
[12:17.010 --> 12:19.010]  based on what pesticides you have applied.
[12:19.010 --> 12:20.370]  Some things don't bother me.
[12:20.370 --> 12:22.890]  Some things I would wanna put on some long sleeves for
[12:22.890 --> 12:24.730]  and not get that on my arms.
[12:24.730 --> 12:26.810]  Just personal preferences, safety,
[12:26.810 --> 12:28.090]  it's always polite anyway.
[12:28.090 --> 12:30.610]  So the next thing we should talk about
[12:30.610 --> 12:32.530]  is how are we gonna hang these plants?
[12:32.530 --> 12:34.330]  Because the next thing you gotta buy
[12:34.330 --> 12:35.930]  is something to hang them on.
[12:35.930 --> 12:36.970]  Are you going to use,
[12:36.970 --> 12:39.730]  so the grow store sells this really nice hanger.
[12:39.730 --> 12:42.570]  It's about three feet around and it hangs in the middle
[12:42.570 --> 12:44.290]  and then it's got four or five shelves on it
[12:44.290 --> 12:46.190]  that you can just fill with buds.
[12:46.190 --> 12:48.050]  That's acceptable if you wanna cut your buds
[12:48.050 --> 12:50.890]  into small pieces or your branches into small pieces
[12:50.890 --> 12:52.770]  and hang it on there, that's just fine,
[12:52.770 --> 12:55.550]  but that's not the way I would prefer to do it.
[12:55.550 --> 12:57.030]  I prefer to hang the branches
[12:57.030 --> 12:58.930]  so that the buds aren't touching anything
[12:58.930 --> 13:00.610]  so that they don't get a flat spot
[13:00.610 --> 13:03.410]  so that there's not a spot where air can't flow around it.
[13:03.410 --> 13:05.230]  I just prefer to hang them.
[13:05.230 --> 13:07.390]  So in Colorado, we're allowed to grow six plants.
[13:07.390 --> 13:09.430]  Let's say we've got a six plant harvest.
[13:09.430 --> 13:12.030]  I would get six coat hangers or clothes hangers
[13:12.030 --> 13:13.470]  and then I would get some fishing line
[13:13.470 --> 13:14.950]  or some thick hemp twine
[13:14.950 --> 13:18.010]  and I would anchor that to two opposite ends of the room.
[13:18.010 --> 13:19.830]  So I've just got a nice piece of string
[13:19.830 --> 13:21.410]  hanging across the room.
[13:21.410 --> 13:23.950]  Now you can hang the plants on that string if you want to,
[13:23.950 --> 13:26.510]  but if you're using multiple strains,
[13:26.510 --> 13:28.230]  maybe you've got six different plants,
[13:28.230 --> 13:30.590]  maybe you've got giant plants,
[13:30.590 --> 13:33.070]  that's when you can cut the plant into smaller pieces
[13:33.070 --> 13:34.550]  and put it on the coat hanger
[13:34.550 --> 13:35.830]  and you can label the coat hanger,
[13:35.830 --> 13:37.530]  this is all sour tangy,
[13:37.530 --> 13:39.110]  this one is all black cherry.
[13:39.110 --> 13:40.730]  That way you don't have one long line of buds
[13:40.730 --> 13:41.950]  that get confused.
[13:41.950 --> 13:43.990]  Also, it makes more space.
[13:43.990 --> 13:46.990]  Another thing you're gonna need is some sort of labels.
[13:46.990 --> 13:48.870]  You might wanna get just some white duct tape.
[13:48.870 --> 13:50.710]  You can always just peel off a piece of duct tape,
[13:50.710 --> 13:52.790]  write on that, stick it wherever you want it,
[13:52.790 --> 13:54.190]  or you can get some real labels
[13:54.190 --> 13:55.790]  or you can improvise however you need to,
[13:55.790 --> 13:57.590]  but you're going to want labels
[13:57.590 --> 13:59.550]  if you've got more than one strain.
[13:59.550 --> 14:01.390]  There's nothing worse than getting shit confused
[14:01.390 --> 14:02.530]  right at the end.
[14:02.530 --> 14:04.030]  That's really frustrating.
[14:04.030 --> 14:07.870]  So, you've got some way to control the odor.
[14:07.870 --> 14:10.950]  You've got a place thought of and prepared
[14:10.950 --> 14:12.870]  where you can control the temperature,
[14:12.870 --> 14:15.870]  the humidity, the lights, the airflow,
[14:15.870 --> 14:17.470]  the aroma, and the security.
[14:17.470 --> 14:18.910]  You've got that all prepared
[14:18.910 --> 14:20.110]  and you've got the proper tools.
[14:20.110 --> 14:23.030]  You've got gloves, you've got something to cut it down with,
[14:23.030 --> 14:25.070]  you've got something to hang it on.
[14:25.070 --> 14:27.910]  Now let's talk about the room just a little bit.
[14:27.910 --> 14:30.550]  You're going to need, I would recommend,
[14:30.550 --> 14:33.390]  a humidifier and a dehumidifier
[14:33.430 --> 14:35.230]  and also some sort of exhaust fan
[14:35.230 --> 14:36.950]  to get the stale air out of the room.
[14:36.950 --> 14:38.190]  If it's a small space,
[14:38.190 --> 14:39.950]  you could probably just crack the door open,
[14:39.950 --> 14:41.190]  but if you've got a lot of plants in there,
[14:41.190 --> 14:43.030]  you're going to need to exchange some air.
[14:43.030 --> 14:45.150]  You're going to need to get that humid air out of there
[14:45.150 --> 14:46.750]  or the plants will never dry.
[14:46.750 --> 14:48.590]  They'll just get stagnant and funky.
[14:48.590 --> 14:51.750]  Also, I may recommend a small fan.
[14:51.750 --> 14:54.090]  You don't want air blowing directly onto the buds,
[14:54.090 --> 14:55.830]  but you want to move that air around.
[14:55.830 --> 14:58.070]  You just don't want it stagnant and funky in there.
[14:58.070 --> 15:00.190]  You really want to be able to control the climate.
[15:00.190 --> 15:01.830]  Also, you're going to need something
[15:01.830 --> 15:03.870]  to tell you what's going on in there.
[15:03.870 --> 15:08.330]  A thermometer, a hygrometer, perhaps a PL grow unit.
[15:09.190 --> 15:10.110]  You want something in there
[15:10.110 --> 15:12.230]  so you know what the temperature is
[15:12.230 --> 15:15.590]  and what the humidity is so you can adjust accordingly.
[15:15.590 --> 15:17.990]  Now it feels like we've talked a lot about what to buy
[15:17.990 --> 15:18.830]  and how to prepare,
[15:18.830 --> 15:21.790]  so let's talk a little bit about the settings in the room
[15:21.790 --> 15:23.830]  since we're talking about all this equipment.
[15:23.830 --> 15:26.750]  I like to put a humidifier and a dehumidifier in the room
[15:26.750 --> 15:29.190]  and I set them both at 50%.
[15:29.190 --> 15:30.710]  That way I know that that room
[15:30.710 --> 15:32.830]  is staying right around 50%.
[15:32.830 --> 15:36.470]  If you can set them up to something like a PL grow unit,
[15:36.470 --> 15:37.870]  or if you can set them up to something
[15:37.870 --> 15:39.790]  that'll trigger them to go off and on
[15:39.790 --> 15:41.710]  based on certain parameters,
[15:41.710 --> 15:43.590]  put them both at 50%.
[15:43.590 --> 15:46.310]  Have the dehumidifier work to 50%,
[15:46.310 --> 15:48.310]  have that humidifier work to 50%,
[15:48.310 --> 15:51.310]  and keep that room at 50% humidity
[15:51.310 --> 15:53.810]  as consistently as possible.
[15:53.810 --> 15:55.070]  Now it may be a good idea
[15:55.070 --> 15:57.470]  to have some sort of exhaust fan in the room.
[15:57.470 --> 16:00.190]  Nothing major, just maybe a little four inch exhauster.
[16:00.190 --> 16:01.190]  If you can do it,
[16:01.190 --> 16:03.770]  if you can just suck the air out of that room occasionally,
[16:03.770 --> 16:04.670]  that would help you out.
[16:04.670 --> 16:07.310]  That would get that old stagnant funky air out of there.
[16:07.310 --> 16:09.270]  If that is not an option,
[16:09.270 --> 16:11.510]  open the door, put a fan by the door,
[16:11.510 --> 16:13.570]  just make sure that air exchanges occasionally
[16:13.570 --> 16:15.910]  so you don't get old air in there.
[16:15.910 --> 16:18.990]  Now inside this room where you've got your dehumidifier,
[16:18.990 --> 16:21.750]  your humidifier, and some air exhaust,
[16:21.750 --> 16:25.470]  try to keep it somewhere around 70 degrees in that room.
[16:25.470 --> 16:28.070]  65 to 75 degrees will be ideal.
[16:28.070 --> 16:30.190]  Any hotter, you're gonna speed up the drying.
[16:30.190 --> 16:31.310]  It's also gonna get funky.
[16:31.310 --> 16:32.870]  It's gonna increase humidity.
[16:32.870 --> 16:35.350]  Any cooler, the room will start getting too dry
[16:35.350 --> 16:38.750]  and your buds will get crispy too quickly.
[16:38.750 --> 16:39.750]  So you've got your temperature,
[16:39.750 --> 16:41.190]  you've got your humidity under control,
[16:41.190 --> 16:42.590]  you've got some air exchange.
[16:42.590 --> 16:44.870]  Let's put a small fan in the room,
[16:44.870 --> 16:47.930]  perhaps on the floor just to keep the air moving around,
[16:47.930 --> 16:49.190]  or up high in the room.
[16:49.190 --> 16:50.490]  You don't want it right in the middle
[16:50.490 --> 16:52.590]  blowing on the plants too much.
[16:52.590 --> 16:53.950]  That's gonna create a dry spot
[16:53.950 --> 16:56.470]  and just dry out some of those buds too quickly.
[16:56.470 --> 16:57.870]  We just wanna move the air around
[16:58.630 --> 16:59.470]  so it doesn't get stale.
[16:59.470 --> 17:00.550]  I usually get one of those fans
[17:00.550 --> 17:02.910]  that would sit on your computer desk, just a desk fan.
[17:02.910 --> 17:05.390]  It's a little tiny, like a 12 or 14 inch fan.
[17:05.390 --> 17:06.710]  Put that in the corner on the floor.
[17:06.710 --> 17:08.350]  If you've got a small room, that is plenty.
[17:08.350 --> 17:10.350]  Just move the air around.
[17:10.350 --> 17:11.690]  All right, so that sounds like we've got
[17:11.690 --> 17:14.190]  a pretty good idea of a dry and cure space.
[17:14.190 --> 17:17.710]  Basically, a small room or a grow tent
[17:17.710 --> 17:19.550]  that you can control the environment in
[17:19.550 --> 17:22.430]  and you can hang those plants in safely, securely,
[17:22.430 --> 17:23.470]  and in the dark.
[17:23.470 --> 17:25.950]  If you need to use a small closet, you can do that.
[17:25.950 --> 17:28.270]  Just make sure that door gets opened
[17:28.270 --> 17:30.330]  and those buds don't get stale in there.
[17:30.330 --> 17:31.990]  Also, like I mentioned earlier,
[17:31.990 --> 17:33.710]  if you don't have sufficient drying space,
[17:33.710 --> 17:35.310]  go ahead and use the flowering room
[17:35.310 --> 17:36.910]  that you flowered the buds in.
[17:36.910 --> 17:38.610]  Or maybe move your next round of plants
[17:38.610 --> 17:41.830]  from the bedroom into that flower and use your bedroom.
[17:41.830 --> 17:45.030]  Grow tents always make nice, dry and cure areas.
[17:45.030 --> 17:47.230]  If you're growing in a five by five tent,
[17:47.230 --> 17:49.390]  you could easily dry your whole harvest
[17:49.390 --> 17:51.630]  in maybe a three by three tent.
[17:51.630 --> 17:52.950]  That wouldn't be a problem at all.
[17:52.950 --> 17:56.630]  You don't need that much room to dry your harvest.
[17:56.630 --> 17:57.470]  Well, hopefully you do.
[17:57.470 --> 17:58.990]  Shit, hopefully you need a 10 by 10,
[17:58.990 --> 18:01.190]  but that's not gonna be logical.
[18:01.190 --> 18:02.390]  All right, now we know what to buy.
[18:02.390 --> 18:04.050]  We know what supplies we're gonna need.
[18:04.050 --> 18:06.630]  We've got a safe space set up for our plants.
[18:06.630 --> 18:08.590]  Hopefully, you've been flushing your plants
[18:08.590 --> 18:10.450]  for 10 to 14 days.
[18:10.450 --> 18:11.770]  There's one more thing we should do
[18:11.770 --> 18:13.470]  before we get to chopping these plants.
[18:13.470 --> 18:15.270]  While they are still standing up,
[18:15.270 --> 18:17.570]  we should go and take off all of the big leaves.
[18:17.570 --> 18:20.390]  Any leaf that you can break off with your hand now,
[18:20.390 --> 18:21.330]  just go ahead and take it off.
[18:21.330 --> 18:22.930]  If the plants don't need leaves,
[18:22.930 --> 18:24.170]  you're about to harvest them.
[18:24.170 --> 18:27.490]  You can do this seven, five, three days before harvest.
[18:27.490 --> 18:29.690]  You could do it right up before the moment you harvest.
[18:29.690 --> 18:31.890]  Just start taking off all those big leaves.
[18:31.890 --> 18:33.830]  Those leaves are unnecessary.
[18:33.830 --> 18:35.730]  I like to just go in and throw them right on the floor.
[18:35.730 --> 18:36.850]  Just start tearing leaves off,
[18:36.850 --> 18:37.690]  throw them right on the floor
[18:37.690 --> 18:38.610]  and sweep up when you're done
[18:38.610 --> 18:40.290]  because there's gonna be a lot of them.
[18:40.290 --> 18:42.530]  Just tear off all of the leaves you can get.
[18:42.530 --> 18:43.530]  You don't need those.
[18:43.530 --> 18:46.930]  This is gonna save you time when it comes harvest time.
[18:46.930 --> 18:49.450]  We're gonna cut these plants down and let them dry.
[18:49.450 --> 18:51.970]  All those long leaves are just gonna dry on there
[18:51.970 --> 18:53.930]  and be in the way and smell funky
[18:53.930 --> 18:56.730]  and they're a sticky bitch to work through once they dry.
[18:56.730 --> 18:58.170]  They're much easier to get off now.
[18:58.170 --> 18:59.930]  So just snap them right off of there.
[18:59.930 --> 19:02.330]  De-leaf the shit out of the entire room
[19:02.330 --> 19:04.850]  before you cut down any of the plants.
[19:04.850 --> 19:07.290]  Once they are all pre-defoliated,
[19:07.290 --> 19:09.890]  that's what I call it, the pre-harvest defoliation,
[19:09.890 --> 19:14.010]  then it is time to start chopping down these plants.
[19:14.010 --> 19:15.330]  Now I don't know how big your plants are,
[19:15.330 --> 19:18.270]  but this is basically how I chop down a plant.
[19:18.270 --> 19:19.950]  I kneel down, or if it's on a table,
[19:19.950 --> 19:22.710]  whatever I walk to it, I usually kneel down to one knee
[19:22.710 --> 19:24.950]  and I grab the plant right above where I'm gonna cut.
[19:24.950 --> 19:27.830]  So I've got the stalk just a couple inches above the dirt.
[19:27.830 --> 19:29.710]  I get my loppers or whatever you wanna call them,
[19:29.710 --> 19:31.350]  your pruners, your shears,
[19:31.350 --> 19:33.430]  and get in there and cut right above the dirt,
[19:33.430 --> 19:35.070]  right below my hand, chop.
[19:35.070 --> 19:36.150]  And now it's gonna fall over.
[19:36.150 --> 19:37.390]  It's gonna timber on me.
[19:37.390 --> 19:39.270]  If I got a little plant, no problem.
[19:39.270 --> 19:41.670]  If I'm in a three or five gallon pot, I got this by myself.
[19:41.670 --> 19:44.670]  If I've got a bigger plant, I will ask somebody to help me.
[19:44.670 --> 19:45.750]  Hey dude, hold the top of this
[19:45.750 --> 19:46.590]  because when I cut it,
[19:46.590 --> 19:48.350]  it's gonna fucking timber down on us.
[19:48.350 --> 19:52.330]  So I would get in there and cut it right at the base.
[19:52.330 --> 19:54.470]  If you have got maybe a tomato cage
[19:54.470 --> 19:57.150]  or some trellising or something like that,
[19:57.150 --> 19:59.510]  maybe figure out how to get the plant out of there
[19:59.510 --> 20:01.110]  by cutting from the top down.
[20:01.110 --> 20:03.350]  I like to cut the whole plant out in one piece
[20:03.350 --> 20:05.310]  and hang the whole thing upside down
[20:05.310 --> 20:07.830]  and let it all dry in one piece.
[20:07.830 --> 20:09.470]  That's the way I like to do it.
[20:09.470 --> 20:11.550]  If you've put the plant in a screen of green
[20:11.550 --> 20:14.790]  or a tomato cage, you may have to start at the top
[20:14.790 --> 20:16.910]  and cut out individual branches.
[20:16.910 --> 20:18.370]  That is just fine.
[20:18.370 --> 20:22.470]  Make sure that you keep each branch of each strain together
[20:22.470 --> 20:23.990]  so that you don't mix anything up.
[20:23.990 --> 20:26.550]  I mentioned earlier how frustrating that shit is.
[20:26.550 --> 20:28.310]  Don't mix stuff up.
[20:28.310 --> 20:29.370]  So separate your plant,
[20:29.370 --> 20:31.390]  free your plant from its tomato cage,
[20:31.390 --> 20:33.950]  free the plant from the trellis however you need to,
[20:33.950 --> 20:35.570]  then chop it down.
[20:35.570 --> 20:37.270]  Now, if you've got the whole plant chopped down
[20:37.270 --> 20:39.110]  in one piece, just get a,
[20:39.110 --> 20:41.230]  I get a fuzzy stick is what they're called.
[20:41.230 --> 20:42.350]  They sell them at Hobby Lobby
[20:42.350 --> 20:44.870]  or you can use the twisty ties
[20:44.870 --> 20:45.990]  that come with your trash bags
[20:45.990 --> 20:48.170]  because I never use the twisty ties on the trash bags anyway.
[20:48.170 --> 20:49.830]  They always end up for this purpose.
[20:49.830 --> 20:52.330]  Wrap the twisty tie around the base of the plant.
[20:52.330 --> 20:53.590]  Do it kind of, do it securely.
[20:53.590 --> 20:56.330]  Put another, put a branch in there because it may slide off
[20:56.330 --> 20:58.950]  and then tie that to either your coat hanger
[20:58.950 --> 21:01.070]  or the line that you're going to hang it from.
[21:01.070 --> 21:03.150]  If you've got the line hanging across the room,
[21:03.150 --> 21:04.510]  attach it to that securely.
[21:04.510 --> 21:06.350]  Hang it on there in a way that you know
[21:06.350 --> 21:07.950]  it's not going to fall.
[21:07.950 --> 21:10.710]  If you've got to cut it down into branches,
[21:10.710 --> 21:14.350]  try to cut to where you create little V-shaped intersections
[21:14.350 --> 21:15.990]  and if you hang the plant upside down,
[21:15.990 --> 21:18.270]  you'll see the little wishbone shaped intersections
[21:18.270 --> 21:20.910]  that you can use perfectly to hang your branches
[21:20.910 --> 21:23.110]  on your coat hanger or on your line.
[21:23.110 --> 21:25.530]  So cut the plant, flip it upside down
[21:25.530 --> 21:28.990]  and just hang it in the size of sections that you need to.
[21:28.990 --> 21:30.150]  Here's some advice.
[21:30.150 --> 21:32.470]  If you have to cut your plant down into smaller sections
[21:32.470 --> 21:36.470]  to make it fit, make the sections similar sizes.
[21:36.470 --> 21:38.890]  That way they dry at similar speeds.
[21:38.890 --> 21:41.010]  If you've got one big piece and one little piece,
[21:41.010 --> 21:42.810]  that big piece is going to take longer to dry
[21:42.810 --> 21:43.650]  than the little piece.
[21:43.650 --> 21:44.810]  It's going to cause unevenness
[21:44.810 --> 21:46.810]  and you're going to be confused on what to do.
[21:46.810 --> 21:48.770]  So chop everything if you're going to chop it,
[21:48.770 --> 21:50.110]  let it all hang in one big piece
[21:50.110 --> 21:52.730]  if you're going to let it hang in one big piece.
[21:52.730 --> 21:55.430]  So cut the plant at the base or pull out the branches,
[21:55.430 --> 21:56.850]  hang them on the coat hanger,
[21:56.850 --> 21:58.530]  either by using the twisty ties
[21:58.530 --> 22:00.690]  and securing it to the coat hanger there,
[22:00.690 --> 22:02.890]  or just by using the V-shaped intersections
[22:02.890 --> 22:04.710]  and hanging it like a little hook
[22:04.710 --> 22:06.370]  on the V-shaped intersection
[22:06.370 --> 22:08.210]  and just get everything hanging safely
[22:08.210 --> 22:09.710]  in your dry and cure room.
[22:09.710 --> 22:12.330]  Chop everything down and just go hang it all up.
[22:12.330 --> 22:14.850]  You're going to be super excited now.
[22:14.850 --> 22:16.970]  You're going to want to go post all your social media
[22:16.970 --> 22:19.410]  about how you just took down your first harvest,
[22:19.410 --> 22:20.870]  but do not do that.
[22:20.870 --> 22:22.670]  Here is some old school advice.
[22:22.670 --> 22:25.490]  Don't post any pictures or talk about your harvest
[22:25.490 --> 22:26.530]  until it's gone.
[22:27.430 --> 22:29.190]  If it's going out for retail,
[22:29.190 --> 22:31.650]  if it's going into your jar, into your safe,
[22:31.650 --> 22:33.310]  that's when you talk about it.
[22:33.310 --> 22:36.130]  Don't talk about it while that shit is hanging in a room.
[22:36.890 --> 22:38.050]  Don't talk about it while you're trimming it.
[22:38.050 --> 22:39.570]  Don't talk about it yet.
[22:39.570 --> 22:41.330]  Just wait, okay?
[22:41.330 --> 22:44.490]  Just wait, because right now it's hanging in a room.
[22:44.490 --> 22:46.970]  And when you go to Walmart
[22:46.970 --> 22:49.050]  and you post that to Facebook also,
[22:49.050 --> 22:50.490]  someone's going in your back fucking door
[22:50.490 --> 22:51.410]  and getting all your weed
[22:51.410 --> 22:52.810]  and they're going to trim it for you
[22:52.810 --> 22:54.470]  and you're never going to see any of it.
[22:54.470 --> 22:56.090]  So don't post yet.
[22:56.090 --> 22:56.930]  Hold off.
[22:56.930 --> 22:58.090]  Just wait.
[22:58.090 --> 23:00.690]  Now, if you're chopping down multiple strains,
[23:00.690 --> 23:03.130]  carefully, carefully, carefully label these plants.
[23:03.130 --> 23:03.970]  You're going to...
[23:03.970 --> 23:04.970]  So I'll go back.
[23:04.970 --> 23:05.810]  I'll recap a little bit
[23:06.530 --> 23:07.370]  because I feel like I went fast.
[23:07.370 --> 23:08.890]  Grab it right above the dirt, chop it down.
[23:08.890 --> 23:10.570]  It's going to flip upside down.
[23:10.570 --> 23:12.330]  Hand it up, hold it upside down.
[23:12.330 --> 23:14.050]  Either put one branch over your line
[23:14.050 --> 23:14.930]  that you're going to hang it on
[23:14.930 --> 23:16.090]  and let it hang right there.
[23:16.090 --> 23:19.150]  Put a label on it or put it on a coat hanger.
[23:19.150 --> 23:20.850]  Just slide the one branch through the coat hanger
[23:20.850 --> 23:21.970]  to where it's got one arm through
[23:21.970 --> 23:22.970]  and then it's just hanging.
[23:22.970 --> 23:23.810]  Put it on the coat hanger
[23:23.810 --> 23:26.370]  or cut it into smaller pieces and do it that way.
[23:26.370 --> 23:28.910]  Label the coat hanger what strain you've got.
[23:29.770 --> 23:33.010]  So cut it down, hang it up, label it.
[23:33.010 --> 23:34.410]  It's going to hang there
[23:34.410 --> 23:37.130]  for somewhere between five and 14,
[23:37.130 --> 23:38.370]  maybe a couple more days.
[23:38.370 --> 23:41.730]  I haven't seen them go more than 14 days in Colorado,
[23:41.730 --> 23:43.610]  but if you're on the coast where you've got humidity,
[23:43.610 --> 23:45.170]  you may get some more time.
[23:45.170 --> 23:46.390]  So you've chopped them down.
[23:46.390 --> 23:47.610]  They're hanging upside down.
[23:47.610 --> 23:49.290]  You've got them labeled.
[23:49.290 --> 23:51.310]  You've got the lights, temperature, humidity,
[23:51.310 --> 23:53.450]  and airflow all controlled in your room.
[23:53.450 --> 23:55.070]  Now you're just going to have to wait
[23:55.070 --> 23:57.050]  somewhere between five and 14 days
[23:57.050 --> 23:59.410]  for those sticks to start snapping.
[23:59.410 --> 24:02.070]  When you bend them, you just want them to go crunch.
[24:02.910 --> 24:04.950]  You don't want them to explode.
[24:04.950 --> 24:06.290]  You don't want them to just crumble up
[24:06.290 --> 24:07.750]  like an old bag of Doritos.
[24:07.750 --> 24:09.030]  You just want them to snap.
[24:09.030 --> 24:10.710]  You don't want a bunch of moisture in there.
[24:10.710 --> 24:13.150]  And check a few of them before you get excited.
[24:13.150 --> 24:15.710]  But when they start snapping consistently,
[24:15.710 --> 24:18.270]  that is when the dry phase has ended
[24:18.270 --> 24:22.430]  and it is time to work yourself into the cure phase.
[24:22.430 --> 24:23.990]  All right, now I did skip the part
[24:23.990 --> 24:25.470]  about putting them onto dry racks
[24:25.470 --> 24:27.670]  that I talked about you could get from the grocery store.
[24:27.670 --> 24:29.510]  The grocery store sells these dry racks.
[24:29.510 --> 24:31.270]  They look like a 22 inch kick drum head.
[24:31.270 --> 24:33.950]  I think they're about 24 inches around.
[24:33.950 --> 24:35.950]  They're meshy and they're kind of cheap,
[24:35.950 --> 24:37.090]  but they work really well.
[24:37.090 --> 24:38.090]  You just hang it up.
[24:39.030 --> 24:41.350]  And for this, I would probably take the buds
[24:41.350 --> 24:44.750]  off of the sticks and just put just the buds
[24:44.750 --> 24:46.610]  into those racks.
[24:46.610 --> 24:48.450]  I wouldn't put the sticks in there.
[24:48.450 --> 24:49.790]  I feel like the sticks are going to take up
[24:49.790 --> 24:50.830]  a lot of space in there.
[24:50.830 --> 24:53.070]  And they also get stuck in the fucking netting a whole lot
[24:53.070 --> 24:54.390]  and they're a pain in the ass.
[24:54.390 --> 24:57.230]  I would cut every single bud off of the stick,
[24:57.230 --> 24:59.710]  if it were me, and I would lay the buds in there
[24:59.710 --> 25:01.670]  and I would spread them out kind of far.
[25:01.670 --> 25:03.190]  And then every morning when I wake up,
[25:03.190 --> 25:05.310]  I would go in there and just move those buds around
[25:05.310 --> 25:07.390]  and kind of shuffle them around a little bit.
[25:07.390 --> 25:09.190]  That's not the ideal way to do it,
[25:09.190 --> 25:11.570]  but I understand that some of us are limited on space.
[25:11.570 --> 25:13.190]  If that's what you've got to do,
[25:13.190 --> 25:15.070]  that's what you have got to do.
[25:15.070 --> 25:17.590]  I would rather see you hang them until they dry
[25:17.590 --> 25:20.270]  and get a little drier and as soon as the stick snaps,
[25:20.270 --> 25:22.010]  then get it off the stick.
[25:22.010 --> 25:25.750]  But I understand that sometimes you've got to improvise.
[25:25.750 --> 25:27.050]  That's part of being a good grower,
[25:27.050 --> 25:29.610]  being able to adjust, adapt, and improvise
[25:29.610 --> 25:31.530]  with what you've got when you've got it.
[25:31.530 --> 25:33.710]  People are so fucking spoiled now.
[25:33.710 --> 25:36.050]  We've got these giant facilities with parking lots
[25:36.050 --> 25:40.690]  and security cameras and loading bays and friends.
[25:40.690 --> 25:42.810]  When I first started doing this, you couldn't talk about it.
[25:42.810 --> 25:44.210]  You couldn't have your friends help you
[25:44.210 --> 25:45.730]  carry your grow shit into the house
[25:45.730 --> 25:47.230]  because now they know you're growing
[25:47.230 --> 25:48.330]  and they're going to want something
[25:48.330 --> 25:50.170]  or they're going to fucking steal it.
[25:50.170 --> 25:52.270]  And if you need more space, you just call a contractor
[25:52.270 --> 25:53.250]  and you get a building permit
[25:53.250 --> 25:54.450]  and you just build out another room
[25:54.450 --> 25:56.210]  and now you've got a dry and cure area.
[25:56.210 --> 25:57.810]  Back in the day, we couldn't do that.
[25:57.810 --> 25:59.490]  You would catch people drying their fucking weed
[25:59.490 --> 26:00.330]  in the bathroom.
[26:00.330 --> 26:01.610]  Hey man, I got to piss while I'm at your house.
[26:01.610 --> 26:02.850]  No bro, you can't pee here.
[26:02.850 --> 26:03.930]  What man, I just got to pee.
[26:03.930 --> 26:05.370]  No bro, you can't pee.
[26:05.370 --> 26:07.050]  And then you catch on later that he was drying
[26:07.050 --> 26:08.930]  and curing his fucking weed in the bathroom.
[26:08.930 --> 26:10.750]  Anyway, I got rambly there.
[26:10.750 --> 26:12.810]  Those dry racks are cool if that's what you got to do.
[26:12.810 --> 26:14.690]  Of course, I would prefer to hang it.
[26:14.690 --> 26:16.450]  I'd prefer to hang it whole plant.
[26:16.450 --> 26:18.790]  I'd prefer to hang it until it starts snapping.
[26:18.790 --> 26:22.170]  Like I said, that's when we enter the cure phase.
[26:22.170 --> 26:23.890]  Now, if you didn't have time or the forethought
[26:23.890 --> 26:26.730]  to start defoliating your plants before you harvested,
[26:26.730 --> 26:27.770]  don't be afraid to go in there
[26:27.770 --> 26:29.490]  and take off all the excess leaves
[26:29.490 --> 26:30.750]  while they're hanging upside down.
[26:30.750 --> 26:33.010]  It is never too late to do that.
[26:33.010 --> 26:35.370]  All right, you guys, I feel like I can recrap.
[26:35.370 --> 26:36.810]  Let's recrap what I said.
[26:36.810 --> 26:39.090]  Probably a recap would be better for a podcast.
[26:39.090 --> 26:40.390]  Let's recap a little bit.
[26:40.390 --> 26:41.530]  You need the appropriate tools.
[26:41.530 --> 26:42.810]  You need the appropriate equipment.
[26:42.810 --> 26:44.050]  You need a good room.
[26:44.050 --> 26:46.770]  You need to be able to control the temperature and humidity.
[26:46.770 --> 26:48.270]  You don't want people getting in there.
[26:48.270 --> 26:50.070]  You need to control the aroma.
[26:50.070 --> 26:51.330]  You're gonna need some gloves.
[26:51.330 --> 26:53.450]  You're gonna need something to hang your plants on
[26:53.970 --> 26:55.730]  and you're going to need some sort of labels
[26:55.730 --> 26:58.570]  if you're growing more than one strain.
[26:58.570 --> 27:00.810]  It's a good idea to start pre-defoliating
[27:00.810 --> 27:03.330]  if you can get in there and take off the leaves before.
[27:03.330 --> 27:05.330]  The chop down process is fairly simple.
[27:05.330 --> 27:07.890]  Grab it, chop it, hang that motherfucker upside down
[27:07.890 --> 27:09.450]  and let it start drying.
[27:09.450 --> 27:10.910]  We know what temperature and humidity
[27:10.910 --> 27:12.530]  we need to keep the dry and cure room.
[27:12.530 --> 27:16.010]  We want about 50%, about 70 degrees.
[27:16.010 --> 27:17.910]  Let those plants hang for four or five days
[27:17.910 --> 27:20.490]  and start snapping the stems and see if they pop.
[27:20.490 --> 27:22.970]  It'll be five, seven, 10, maybe 14 days
[27:23.490 --> 27:24.970]  before they're ready to go into containers.
[27:24.970 --> 27:26.330]  That's when we're gonna jar them up.
[27:26.330 --> 27:28.210]  That's where we're gonna put them into containers.
[27:28.210 --> 27:30.330]  That's when the cure process is gonna start.
[27:30.330 --> 27:32.770]  So I think we've got a good grasp
[27:32.770 --> 27:34.930]  on how to harvest our plants.
[27:34.930 --> 27:36.690]  The next step in harvesting, you guys,
[27:36.690 --> 27:39.930]  is to get in there and clean and reset the grow room.
[27:39.930 --> 27:40.770]  That's right.
[27:40.770 --> 27:42.410]  It may be time to buy new bulbs.
[27:42.410 --> 27:44.850]  It may be time to change your air conditioner filters.
[27:44.850 --> 27:46.930]  It is certainly time to clean the cover
[27:46.930 --> 27:48.450]  on your carbon filter.
[27:48.450 --> 27:51.010]  Also, maybe get in there and scrub the lenses.
[27:51.010 --> 27:54.130]  If you've got glass lenses on your ducted hoods,
[27:54.130 --> 27:56.690]  it's a good time to get in there and scrub that shit out.
[27:56.690 --> 27:58.890]  Make sure that everything is nice and clean.
[27:58.890 --> 28:00.790]  Clean the room with a cleaning product,
[28:00.790 --> 28:03.010]  maybe some bleach, maybe some Fizan,
[28:03.010 --> 28:04.450]  whatever you've got, get in there
[28:04.450 --> 28:06.690]  and clean the shit out of the grow room.
[28:06.690 --> 28:08.450]  Get in the corners,
[28:08.450 --> 28:10.570]  get in all the spots you've been missing.
[28:10.570 --> 28:12.170]  If you plan on using your grow room
[28:12.170 --> 28:14.430]  or your grow hut as your drying space,
[28:14.430 --> 28:16.530]  that's a good excuse, but you're gonna have to clean it
[28:16.530 --> 28:18.010]  as soon as you're done with that.
[28:18.010 --> 28:19.410]  As soon as those plants come out of there
[28:19.410 --> 28:21.330]  and you're trimming, you should take a break
[28:21.330 --> 28:23.690]  and go clean the shit out of your grow space
[28:23.690 --> 28:25.650]  before you put more plants in there.
[28:25.650 --> 28:28.570]  That is the completion of your harvest.
[28:28.570 --> 28:31.490]  That is also the completion of your harvest lesson,
[28:31.490 --> 28:32.410]  ladies and gentlemen.
[28:32.410 --> 28:33.650]  Thanks for hanging out with me.
[28:33.650 --> 28:37.610]  I think the next episode, I have a guest scheduled,
[28:37.610 --> 28:38.830]  so there will be another episode
[28:38.830 --> 28:40.330]  before the dry and cure episode,
[28:40.330 --> 28:44.370]  but there is an in-depth dry and cure episode coming up.
[28:44.370 --> 28:46.450]  We'll also talk about trimming a little bit.
[28:46.450 --> 28:48.610]  And then I think we're gonna continue with grow lessons
[28:48.650 --> 28:49.970]  and we're gonna start over.
[28:49.970 --> 28:52.610]  We're gonna go right into germinating seeds
[28:52.610 --> 28:56.490]  and cutting clones and getting a grow started all over again.
[28:56.490 --> 28:59.330]  I've got a lot of fun things planned out for the podcast.
[28:59.330 --> 29:00.270]  Please stick around, you guys.
[29:00.270 --> 29:03.730]  I think you will enjoy what I have planned for everybody.
[29:03.730 --> 29:05.090]  You guys, I wanna give some shout outs.
[29:05.090 --> 29:07.410]  Let's give a huge shout out to my friend, Melanie Alexander,
[29:07.410 --> 29:11.290]  and also a gigantic shout out to Aaron Johnson.
[29:11.290 --> 29:12.990]  I also wanna give a huge shout out to everybody
[29:12.990 --> 29:15.810]  who contributed to the Patreon campaign.
[29:15.810 --> 29:17.770]  Thank you, I appreciate it.
[29:17.770 --> 29:20.010]  And also, a shout out to everybody who messaged me
[29:20.010 --> 29:23.490]  and let me know that Stitcher was not working properly.
[29:23.490 --> 29:24.370]  That's huge help.
[29:24.370 --> 29:26.330]  If nobody tells me, I don't know, it's broken,
[29:26.330 --> 29:28.770]  I can't fix it, so thanks for reaching out.
[29:28.770 --> 29:30.030]  Ladies and gentlemen, I wanna thank you guys
[29:30.030 --> 29:31.090]  for listening to the podcast.

[30:29.090 --> 30:31.030]  I keep mentioning my Patreon campaign.
[30:31.030 --> 30:32.590]  Let me tell you guys about that.
[30:32.590 --> 30:34.830]  If you feel like this podcast was worth a couple of bucks
[30:34.830 --> 30:37.050]  and you'd like to contribute to the show financially,
[30:37.050 --> 30:39.510]  you can do so by going to patreon.com

[30:43.190 --> 30:44.270]  will be right there.
[30:44.270 --> 30:46.870]  I would appreciate your support.
[30:46.870 --> 30:49.750]  All right, podcast world, I am gonna wrap up this podcast.
[30:49.750 --> 30:52.990]  I am not sure if I will do a Thursday episode this week.
[30:52.990 --> 30:57.510]  I've got plans to record an episode in Denver on Wednesday.
[30:57.510 --> 31:00.830]  I probably won't be able to get that prepared until Monday,
[31:00.830 --> 31:03.450]  so that disrupts my recording schedule a little bit,
[31:03.450 --> 31:04.990]  but I do apologize.
[31:04.990 --> 31:07.550]  I told you I may miss a Thursday occasionally.
[31:07.550 --> 31:10.470]  This will be the first Thursday that I've missed
[31:10.470 --> 31:12.430]  since I started Thursday episodes.
[31:12.430 --> 31:14.110]  I apologize if it happens.
[31:14.110 --> 31:14.950]  You guys know me.
[31:14.950 --> 31:16.630]  I'm probably gonna put together something
[31:16.630 --> 31:18.670]  just to have it prepared just in case.
[31:18.670 --> 31:20.670]  So, look forward to an episode Thursday.
[31:20.670 --> 31:22.810]  If you don't see me Thursday, don't panic.
[31:22.810 --> 31:24.150]  I'm just catching a quick break.
[31:24.150 --> 31:26.850]  I went to Denver to record Wednesday and I got overwhelmed.
[31:26.850 --> 31:28.630]  The episode will probably come out Monday
[31:28.630 --> 31:30.970]  and everything will be just fine.
[31:30.970 --> 31:32.550]  I miss you guys and I still love you.
[31:32.550 --> 31:34.070]  Don't worry, I didn't break up with you.
[31:34.070 --> 31:35.270]  We're gonna be all right.
[31:35.270 --> 31:37.090]  Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for letting me ramble.
[31:37.090 --> 31:38.550]  Thanks for hanging out with me.
[31:38.550 --> 31:40.430]  Thank you for all the support on the podcast.
[31:40.430 --> 31:42.170]  Thanks for all the social media interaction.
[31:42.910 --> 31:43.750]  Thanks for all the words of encouragement.
[31:43.750 --> 31:45.130]  Thanks for all the great emails.
[31:45.130 --> 31:47.370]  I truly appreciate my audience.
[31:47.370 --> 31:48.970]  You guys are like my second family
[31:48.970 --> 31:50.970]  and I don't know what I would do without you.
[31:50.970 --> 31:52.010]  Thank you.
[31:52.010 --> 31:53.730]  You guys, that's all I've got for you today.
[31:53.730 --> 31:56.450]  I'm gonna give a huge shout out to my buddy Decker Doom
[31:56.450 --> 31:59.210]  and until next time, take a fat dab
[31:59.210 --> 32:00.770]  and give your mom a hug for me.
