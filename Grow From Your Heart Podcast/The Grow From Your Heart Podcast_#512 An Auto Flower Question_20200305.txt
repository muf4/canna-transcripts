[00:40.220 --> 00:43.660]  You know I like to start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:43.660 --> 00:48.580]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Stardog batter from Apothecary Farms.
[00:48.580 --> 00:51.220]  I'm going to open up the package and give it a smell.
[00:51.220 --> 00:52.620]  I really love Stardog.
[00:52.620 --> 00:54.860]  It has always been one of my favorite strains.
[00:54.940 --> 00:58.220]  I think it smells this product and the Stardog smell gassy.
[00:58.220 --> 00:59.400]  There's some funk to it.
[00:59.400 --> 01:02.180]  I love that earthy, fuely, gassy aroma.
[01:02.180 --> 01:04.500]  I really love the buzz from Stardog.
[01:04.500 --> 01:08.600]  I really like the flavor, the texture, and the aroma of this concentrate.
[01:08.600 --> 01:17.180]  On the package, the label says the product contains 63.2% THC, zero CBD, and 74% total
[01:17.180 --> 01:18.300]  cannabinoids.
[01:18.300 --> 01:22.700]  I grabbed this one because I love that funky stink that's coming off of it.
[01:22.700 --> 01:24.980]  I always love that Stardog buzz.
[01:24.980 --> 01:27.700]  Big shout out to our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[01:27.700 --> 01:31.740]  When I take a break in the middle of the podcast, I do plan on taking a big fat dab of this
[01:31.740 --> 01:35.580]  Orange Skittles batter, once again from Apothecary.
[01:35.580 --> 01:39.220]  This one smells like funky orange Skittles.
[01:39.220 --> 01:41.580]  I can't wait to take a dab of this one.
[01:41.580 --> 01:43.900]  That's what we're dabbing on today's episode.
[01:43.900 --> 01:48.300]  Now let's move into the Patreon shout out portion of the episode.
[01:48.300 --> 01:52.260]  You guys know I like to give thanks to all of the people who support the show on Patreon.
[01:52.820 --> 01:55.540]  Let's start off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast hug and a thank you to my good
[01:55.540 --> 01:56.820]  friend Miss Mel.
[01:56.820 --> 02:00.580]  Let's give a huge giant Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you to Tyler R.
[02:00.580 --> 02:03.020]  Let's send a big fat dab to Callie Canopy.
[02:03.020 --> 02:05.580]  I want to send a big fist bump to my buddy Paul.
[02:05.580 --> 02:08.680]  Let's roll a big fat joint for my friend Hogan's Farm.
[02:08.680 --> 02:12.340]  Let's also pack up the bong for my good buddy Reefer Madness.
[02:12.340 --> 02:16.580]  I want to send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out and a dab to my
[02:16.580 --> 02:18.700]  buddy Melvin818.
[02:18.700 --> 02:22.580]  Let's also send a giant thank you shout out and how about a big fat rolled up joint to
[02:22.580 --> 02:27.180]  my buddy Darren W. Let's also pass that joint over to my buddy Eric Ross.
[02:27.180 --> 02:31.380]  And I also want to send a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out thank you and
[02:31.380 --> 02:34.500]  a big fat dab to my friend Sour D.
[02:34.500 --> 02:39.700]  Once again, big thank you, big shout out to everybody who supports the show on Patreon.

[02:56.780 --> 02:59.180]  Big thanks for all of the love and support.
[02:59.180 --> 03:02.660]  All right, let's talk about some stuff that I have got going on.
[03:02.660 --> 03:05.740]  I had an amazing birthday weekend.
[03:05.740 --> 03:10.620]  My birthday was technically on Sunday, but I think we began celebrating around Wednesday
[03:10.620 --> 03:13.860]  and it is now Tuesday and it has not stopped.
[03:13.860 --> 03:18.420]  I don't drink, I don't party hard, but I've been going to dinner, I've been going to lunches,
[03:18.420 --> 03:20.940]  I went to brunch, just been hanging out with a bunch of friends.
[03:20.940 --> 03:24.260]  I think I've got plans to go bowling with some friends here in just a few.
[03:24.260 --> 03:26.460]  It has been an amazing birthday weekend.
[03:26.460 --> 03:29.020]  I was overloaded with birthday love.
[03:29.020 --> 03:34.000]  My Facebook exploded, my email exploded, my Instagram exploded, my text messages would
[03:34.000 --> 03:36.460]  not stop all day, my phone kept ringing.
[03:36.460 --> 03:39.820]  It was a very blessed day to be Ross DeGeff.
[03:39.820 --> 03:43.940]  A big thank you to everybody who sent me some sort of love on my birthday.
[03:43.940 --> 03:48.100]  If it was a high five, if it was a text message, if you just sent me a DM on Instagram, it
[03:48.100 --> 03:49.340]  all means a lot to me.
[03:49.340 --> 03:50.340]  Thank you.
[03:50.340 --> 03:51.580]  I was overwhelmed with messages.
[03:51.580 --> 03:57.180]  I cannot begin to thank each person individually because it would take me four podcast episodes
[03:57.180 --> 03:58.180]  to cover that.
[03:58.180 --> 03:59.580]  I had an awesome birthday weekend.
[03:59.580 --> 04:00.580]  Thank you guys.
[04:00.580 --> 04:01.580]  I got a lot of great gifts.
[04:01.580 --> 04:04.020]  I spent a lot of great time with friends and that's what matters.
[04:04.020 --> 04:06.500]  Go spend time with people that you love and want to be around.
[04:06.500 --> 04:08.220]  I spent a lot of time with my mama.
[04:08.740 --> 04:11.700]  I spent a lot of time with most of my real good friends have come around for my birthday.
[04:11.700 --> 04:15.620]  Unfortunately, Clint has been sick, so he's down with some fucking ... He doesn't have
[04:15.620 --> 04:16.620]  the thing.
[04:16.620 --> 04:19.660]  He doesn't have that one, but he's been pretty sick.
[04:19.660 --> 04:21.540]  When he gets better, he'll come take some dabs.
[04:21.540 --> 04:23.540]  He's just got to shake it off and pony up.
[04:23.540 --> 04:24.620]  He'll be over here.
[04:24.620 --> 04:26.060]  Most everybody has been by.
[04:26.060 --> 04:28.300]  Everybody got to come take some dabs or I went and dabbed with them.
[04:28.300 --> 04:29.300]  It's been a great birthday.
[04:29.300 --> 04:30.540]  Let's quit rambling about my birthday.
[04:30.540 --> 04:31.540]  It wasn't your birthday.
[04:31.540 --> 04:35.340]  You probably don't care, but thanks for all the great birthday love and support.
[04:35.860 --> 04:42.300]  Last week, I put out an episode which featured a very highly medicated white Mike.
[04:42.300 --> 04:48.180]  We let Mike ramble for a good 40 minutes and I got a lot of response to that episode.
[04:48.180 --> 04:51.020]  On Mike's behalf, a big thank you.
[04:51.020 --> 04:57.020]  We both love and appreciate the comments and the support and the response and the reaction.
[04:57.020 --> 05:00.060]  I can't speak for Mike when I say that that means a lot to me.
[05:00.060 --> 05:03.700]  That's really energizing and really refueling and it's motivating.
[05:03.700 --> 05:04.780]  It keeps us going.
[05:04.780 --> 05:08.060]  I'm pretty sure Mike would agree with that, but I don't want to put words in his mouth.
[05:08.060 --> 05:12.340]  I can say that Mike says thank you because that stuff does mean a lot to us.
[05:12.340 --> 05:15.260]  Thank you for all of the ... There were a lot of YouTube comments.
[05:15.260 --> 05:20.620]  I got a lot of emails, a lot of Instagram comments, a lot of Cannabuzz comments about
[05:20.620 --> 05:23.580]  the last episode where Mike went on a major ramble.
[05:23.580 --> 05:24.580]  Thank you for all the support.
[05:24.580 --> 05:28.300]  I never know how that's going to go over when I put out 40 minutes of Mike rambling and
[05:28.300 --> 05:30.820]  you guys responded beautifully.
[05:30.820 --> 05:31.820]  Thank you.
[05:31.820 --> 05:32.820]  Hey, Mike.
[05:32.820 --> 05:33.820]  Come back.
[05:33.860 --> 05:34.860]  Let's do it again.
[05:34.860 --> 05:39.140]  Oh, and by the way, I want to congratulate Mike on the show.
[05:39.140 --> 05:42.580]  I haven't seen him in a couple of days, but the last time I saw him, Mike had been going
[05:42.580 --> 05:44.940]  quite a while without cigarettes.
[05:44.940 --> 05:47.260]  I don't remember the exact day, but I was fucking impressed.
[05:47.260 --> 05:50.420]  So big shout out to Mike for not smoking cigarettes anymore.
[05:50.420 --> 05:51.420]  Love you, bro.
[05:51.420 --> 05:52.420]  Take good care of yourself.
[05:52.420 --> 05:53.420]  Keep your health in check.
[05:53.420 --> 05:54.420]  You're on the right path.
[05:54.420 --> 05:55.420]  I'm going to brag.
[05:55.420 --> 06:01.340]  I haven't had a soda and I've had very minimal sugar and caffeine for almost two and a half
[06:01.340 --> 06:02.660]  weeks now.
[06:02.660 --> 06:05.120]  And I feel fucking amazing, you guys.
[06:05.120 --> 06:09.100]  If you're one of those caffeine people, I was a caffeine people and I would overload
[06:09.100 --> 06:10.100]  myself on caffeine.
[06:10.100 --> 06:14.020]  And the only thing that I thought would give me some more energy was more caffeine.
[06:14.020 --> 06:17.340]  And now that I'm not consuming caffeine, I've never had more fucking energy.
[06:17.340 --> 06:20.580]  So if you're fighting that caffeine battle, you're never going to win.
[06:20.580 --> 06:22.860]  You may have to clean your shit up and stop doing that.
[06:22.860 --> 06:27.500]  I'm not going to brag about my dietary accomplishments, but I felt proud, wanted to share.
[06:27.500 --> 06:30.700]  Mainly, big shout out to Mike for fucking cutting out the cigarettes.
[06:31.060 --> 06:36.140]  Also, we've inspired Double Door Matt to chill out on his caffeine and Dr. Pepper intake.
[06:36.140 --> 06:39.740]  So big shout out to all my friends for attempting to take better care of themselves.
[06:39.740 --> 06:40.740]  We're getting older, you guys.
[06:40.740 --> 06:41.740]  We are not going to get any younger.
[06:41.740 --> 06:44.060]  You're not just going to spontaneously get healthier.
[06:44.060 --> 06:45.140]  We got to take care of ourselves.
[06:45.140 --> 06:47.860]  This is not a fucking health and motivation podcast, you guys.
[06:47.860 --> 06:48.940]  I just got on a ramble.
[06:48.940 --> 06:50.820]  I'm fucking stoned from these dabs.
[06:50.820 --> 06:51.820]  Let's keep moving.
[06:51.820 --> 06:52.980]  What else is new in my life?
[06:52.980 --> 06:55.140]  I like to give you garden updates.
[06:55.140 --> 07:00.740]  I have made good friends with an LED company and they have decided to offer me some lights
[07:00.740 --> 07:02.780]  to run in a grow environment.
[07:02.780 --> 07:07.060]  So I have recently hung up some Canon LEDs from our friends at Black Sale Market.
[07:07.060 --> 07:10.260]  Big shout out to everybody over there working their asses off at Black Sale.
[07:10.260 --> 07:12.420]  I see you guys working your face off.
[07:12.420 --> 07:13.420]  Big respect for that.
[07:13.420 --> 07:16.940]  I know what it's like being a new startup company, being a gondrapreneur.
[07:16.940 --> 07:20.100]  And there are so many LED companies out there and you are standing out.
[07:20.100 --> 07:21.740]  So that takes effort.
[07:21.740 --> 07:25.340]  I'm going to run these LEDs and I will give you guys honest feedback.
[07:25.340 --> 07:29.220]  I did say that I made friends with the guy over there and it is important to me that
[07:29.220 --> 07:31.260]  I give my friend honest feedback.
[07:31.260 --> 07:36.940]  Even if these lights are amazing or terrible, I'm going to give you amazingly honest feedback.
[07:36.940 --> 07:38.380]  I'm not going to butter anything up.
[07:38.380 --> 07:40.220]  I'm going to let you know what I think.
[07:40.220 --> 07:44.540]  I will tell you that the moment I plugged them in, I said, holy shit, those are bright.
[07:44.540 --> 07:47.660]  And then I invited Double Door Matt over and I go, bro, look at these fucking lights.
[07:47.660 --> 07:51.700]  And I plugged him in and he just put his hands over his eyes and he's like, fuck dude.
[07:51.700 --> 07:55.060]  Like he was blinded for a couple of minutes and it wasn't, I wasn't trying to kill anybody.
[07:55.060 --> 07:57.420]  They're just so bright that it's overwhelming.
[07:57.420 --> 08:03.220]  Even for a grower who has been in a grow room all the time, those, I put those two LEDs
[08:03.220 --> 08:06.460]  in a five by five tent and I'm still covering my eyes right now because I'm just thinking
[08:06.460 --> 08:07.860]  of how fucking bright it is.
[08:07.860 --> 08:09.100]  They're tremendously bright in there.
[08:09.100 --> 08:10.900]  So big shout out to my buddy at Black Sale.
[08:10.900 --> 08:12.660]  He didn't pay for any advertising.
[08:12.660 --> 08:15.040]  He sent me lights and wants quality reviews.
[08:15.040 --> 08:17.580]  He deserves a shout out because he's a cool fucking dude.
[08:17.580 --> 08:18.640]  Big shout out to Keith.
[08:18.640 --> 08:21.560]  Big shout out to all the crew at Black Sale Market.
[08:21.560 --> 08:24.160]  All right, you guys, I'm going to take a fucking quick drink.
[08:24.160 --> 08:25.640]  I'm just going to keep recording while I do it.
[08:25.640 --> 08:27.480]  My voice is doing something skippy here.
[08:27.480 --> 08:29.760]  So this is what it sounds like when you hydrate.
[08:29.760 --> 08:37.180]  Yeah, usually I edit that crap out, but just be here with me today.
[08:37.180 --> 08:38.180]  It's fun.
[08:38.180 --> 08:39.180]  Come hang out at the table, take some dabs.
[08:39.180 --> 08:40.860]  If you want to dab, you can hit whatever's on the table.
[08:40.860 --> 08:42.060]  We got several options here.
[08:42.060 --> 08:43.060]  There's a dabber right there.
[08:43.060 --> 08:44.460]  Make yourselves comfortable, please.
[08:44.460 --> 08:46.260]  Just don't be too loud while we're on the podcast.
[08:46.260 --> 08:47.260]  We'll be all right.
[08:47.260 --> 08:48.260]  Join me.
[08:48.260 --> 08:49.260]  We're going to have fun.
[08:49.260 --> 08:50.380]  I told you guys I got stoned and I'm in a good fucking mood.
[08:50.380 --> 08:51.380]  All right.
[08:52.060 --> 08:53.740]  So I just want to read a couple of emails that some folks have sent us.
[08:53.740 --> 08:58.540]  I really enjoy producing what I call listener generated content.
[08:58.540 --> 09:01.540]  That way I know that I'm answering at least one person's question out there.
[09:01.540 --> 09:03.180]  At least one person needs some help.
[09:03.180 --> 09:07.120]  And I figure if one person has this question and they had the motivation to just write
[09:07.120 --> 09:10.820]  a simple email to me and ask me, I figure if one person sent me the question, there's
[09:10.820 --> 09:14.980]  got to be at least 10 people out there asking, maybe 20, who knows, maybe a hundred people
[09:14.980 --> 09:18.980]  out there with the same exact question as this one person, whoever's sending whatever
[09:18.980 --> 09:19.980]  email.
[09:19.980 --> 09:22.620]  So I love creating listener generated content.
[09:22.620 --> 09:23.700]  I know I'm helping.
[09:23.700 --> 09:24.700]  That's my point here.
[09:24.700 --> 09:25.700]  I'm fucking rambling.
[09:25.700 --> 09:26.700]  You guys, I kind of apologize.
[09:26.700 --> 09:27.700]  Kind of don't.
[09:27.700 --> 09:29.100]  I'm supposed to come talk on a podcast.
[09:29.100 --> 09:30.260]  That's my job, right?
[09:30.260 --> 09:31.940]  Just try not to be Mike this time.
[09:31.940 --> 09:36.340]  Anyway, I'm going to read an email because I like helping my friends.
[09:36.340 --> 09:39.540]  The first email on today's episode goes a little bit like this.
[09:39.540 --> 09:40.900]  It says Rasta Jeff.
[09:40.900 --> 09:45.380]  I was hoping I would get a chance to catch you out at the DGC bus and do some dabs.
[09:45.380 --> 09:49.780]  You and Scotty real are the only people that I follow closely and I didn't get to smoke
[09:49.820 --> 09:50.820]  with.
[09:50.820 --> 09:55.340]  I met Scotty too though and he gave me and my fiance a DGC t-shirt, which was really
[09:55.340 --> 09:56.380]  cool.
[09:56.380 --> 09:57.900]  So this is my friend, Giant Mike.
[09:57.900 --> 10:02.780]  He was at the Indo Expo and he was hoping that I would be able to go out and smoke at
[10:02.780 --> 10:08.700]  the DGC bus because my friends at the Dude Grows crew, that is the dude from the Dude
[10:08.700 --> 10:11.740]  Grows show and Scotty real and we can't leave out Guru.
[10:11.740 --> 10:15.620]  And there are so many folks in the DGC now that I can't even start listing people, but
[10:15.620 --> 10:19.060]  we got to mention JR Token and Maestro and I'm sure I'm going to miss somebody.
[10:19.100 --> 10:20.420]  I apologize if I left you out.
[10:20.420 --> 10:21.420]  I still love you.
[10:21.420 --> 10:22.420]  Don't worry.
[10:22.420 --> 10:26.820]  I told you I took dabs, but the DGC crew, the Dude Grows gang, they got a smoke bus,
[10:26.820 --> 10:30.820]  which was equipped with rigs and seats and air conditioning.
[10:30.820 --> 10:35.940]  And they were outside dabbing out while I was inside busting my ass at the Irie Genetics
[10:35.940 --> 10:36.940]  booth.
[10:36.940 --> 10:37.940]  I'm just kidding.
[10:37.940 --> 10:38.940]  It's not busting my ass.
[10:38.940 --> 10:42.260]  I work up a sweat and I talk up a storm, but it is nothing but fun for me the entire time
[10:42.260 --> 10:43.460]  at that expo.
[10:43.460 --> 10:46.740]  But my friend is saying that he was wishing he could catch me at the bus.
[10:46.740 --> 10:48.740]  I never made it to the bus.
[10:49.420 --> 10:53.980]  I used the gender specific vape lounge, which was a few feet from my booth.
[10:53.980 --> 10:58.540]  But other than that, I did not get to do much medicating and I really did not venture out
[10:58.540 --> 11:01.140]  from my booth during the event much at all.
[11:01.140 --> 11:04.540]  I think I used the restroom and that gender specific vape lounge, which may have been
[11:04.540 --> 11:07.500]  the same little room right there, which was ironic.
[11:07.500 --> 11:09.800]  So I did not make it out to the bus is my point.
[11:09.800 --> 11:14.740]  The message goes on to say, we were surprised how cool everyone was and how they welcomed
[11:14.740 --> 11:16.380]  us with open arms.
[11:17.100 --> 11:19.620]  That event was kind of like a family gathering.
[11:19.620 --> 11:22.660]  I've been going to those events and that expo for quite a while.
[11:22.660 --> 11:27.140]  And I know most of the people in the building, especially the vendors, the exhibitors, all
[11:27.140 --> 11:30.980]  the breeders, all the nutrient companies, all the light guys, we've all been loading
[11:30.980 --> 11:33.060]  in and out of that event together for years now.
[11:33.060 --> 11:34.060]  We all go to the same events.
[11:34.060 --> 11:35.580]  We're all in the same club.
[11:35.580 --> 11:37.180]  So in the morning, it's just like, what's up, Jaren?
[11:37.180 --> 11:38.180]  How you doing, Jeff?
[11:38.180 --> 11:39.180]  Hey, what's up, Steve?
[11:39.180 --> 11:40.180]  How you doing over there?
[11:40.180 --> 11:41.180]  Hey, what's up, Scott?
[11:41.180 --> 11:43.100]  And everyone's just saying hi to everybody and we all know each other and we help each
[11:43.100 --> 11:44.100]  other out.
[11:44.100 --> 11:48.340]  We're going to dinner at the end of the night and we're like that with the other expo people
[11:48.340 --> 11:52.460]  and our friends that come to see us, especially our friends that come to see us from far away,
[11:52.460 --> 11:54.300]  our friends that have been supporting us for a long time.
[11:54.300 --> 11:55.800]  We've got to show you love.
[11:55.800 --> 12:00.220]  The message goes on to say, I watch the Embracing Organics show regularly.
[12:00.220 --> 12:04.780]  And if you guys aren't aware, I am on another podcast at least every other week and it's
[12:04.780 --> 12:06.100]  called Embracing Organics.
[12:06.100 --> 12:07.100]  It's on YouTube.
[12:07.100 --> 12:09.240]  I try to be there every week, but I stay busy.
[12:09.240 --> 12:13.180]  So I've been doing every other week just to keep myself fresh on there.
[12:13.260 --> 12:15.020]  Embracing Organics is a YouTube show.
[12:15.020 --> 12:18.120]  It is live on YouTube every Thursday.
[12:18.120 --> 12:19.820]  I'm in the mountain time zone.
[12:19.820 --> 12:22.180]  So for myself, it is 7 p.m.
[12:22.180 --> 12:23.820]  We start about 7.10.
[12:23.820 --> 12:24.820]  We're all stoners.
[12:24.820 --> 12:27.540]  It's about 7.10, 7.15 when we get going live.
[12:27.540 --> 12:29.340]  We go for about two hours.
[12:29.340 --> 12:30.780]  The show stays up on YouTube.
[12:30.780 --> 12:34.540]  So if you don't catch it live, you can watch all the Embracing Organics episodes.
[12:34.540 --> 12:36.420]  But I'm on that show quite regularly.
[12:36.420 --> 12:39.780]  I try to contribute my breeding and cultivation knowledge to that show.
[12:39.780 --> 12:40.780]  It's a great show.
[12:40.780 --> 12:44.020]  I've built a lot of great friends and a lot of great relationships from that show.
[12:44.020 --> 12:48.900]  But it says, I watch the Embracing Organics show regularly and I sat down and did dabs
[12:48.900 --> 12:49.900]  with Keith.
[12:49.900 --> 12:52.420]  Keith, that's the second time you got a shout out on the show, bro.
[12:52.420 --> 12:54.660]  And smoked with Stabby and the rest of the panel.
[12:54.660 --> 12:56.860]  Big shout out to my buddy Stabby McStabwood.
[12:56.860 --> 13:01.300]  We shot the shit with Tenasi many times and was even going to meet up later in the week
[13:01.300 --> 13:02.620]  to hang out with Tenasi.
[13:02.620 --> 13:05.260]  But he got caught up with the funk at the expo.
[13:05.260 --> 13:09.380]  Yeah, some people do get that expo, whoop, flu, that cup cough sort of stuff.
[13:09.380 --> 13:10.380]  That does happen.
[13:10.980 --> 13:12.860]  I think that same whoop, flu tried to kill Scotty Real.
[13:12.860 --> 13:14.340]  It took down a couple of people.
[13:14.340 --> 13:17.140]  I think I have become immune to the whoop, flu.
[13:17.140 --> 13:18.140]  I don't get the cup cough.
[13:18.140 --> 13:19.900]  I don't get sick from those events anymore.
[13:19.900 --> 13:20.900]  I seem to do all right.
[13:20.900 --> 13:23.220]  I used to come back fucking wrecked from those things.
[13:23.220 --> 13:26.900]  Now I just noticed that I come back with no voice because I smoke way too much.
[13:26.900 --> 13:31.500]  I take too many dabs and I talk too damn much is my problem.
[13:31.500 --> 13:35.260]  I'm going to try to focus on this email because this is going to be a five hour podcast if
[13:35.260 --> 13:37.140]  I don't get my shit together.
[13:37.140 --> 13:39.340]  It goes on to say, where was I?
[13:39.340 --> 13:41.660]  We also did dabs with Pedro and Dizzy.
[13:41.660 --> 13:43.060]  Big shout out to Pedro and Dizzy.
[13:43.060 --> 13:44.060]  Great folks.
[13:44.060 --> 13:45.060]  Pedro makes amazing concentrates.
[13:45.060 --> 13:46.860]  Dizzy is a wonderful person.
[13:46.860 --> 13:49.100]  I think she makes good concentrates and grows as well.
[13:49.100 --> 13:51.140]  I am not sure her role in that relationship.
[13:51.140 --> 13:53.340]  I know she's a badass mom and that's what fucking matters.
[13:53.340 --> 13:55.500]  So big shout out to Pedro and Dizzy.
[13:55.500 --> 13:59.700]  Pedro hooked us up with some rosin and JR Token gave us some of his cookie crumble to
[13:59.700 --> 14:01.740]  smoke while we were there.
[14:01.740 --> 14:02.740]  Isn't that awesome?
[14:02.740 --> 14:05.220]  You show up and people are like, here's concentrate, here's flowers.
[14:05.220 --> 14:06.220]  High five.
[14:06.220 --> 14:07.220]  Thanks for being our friends.
[14:07.220 --> 14:08.220]  And you're like, wait, I follow you.
[14:08.220 --> 14:09.220]  Why are you thanking me?
[14:09.300 --> 14:14.620]  Yeah, because without you, people that follow us and support us and show us love and actually
[14:14.620 --> 14:18.900]  click like and fucking do things like that, send things to our Patreon and help us out
[14:18.900 --> 14:22.020]  on PayPal occasionally, we aren't able to do what we do.
[14:22.020 --> 14:23.020]  We aren't anything.
[14:23.020 --> 14:24.540]  We're just people with hopes and dreams.
[14:24.540 --> 14:27.900]  I feel like I'd be a lunatic if you weren't listening to this podcast.
[14:27.900 --> 14:32.420]  I'd just be a fucking crazy person with way too many toys and way too many gadgets talking
[14:32.420 --> 14:33.420]  to myself.
[14:33.420 --> 14:38.700]  So I personally love it when I meet people who support the Grow From Your Heart podcast
[14:38.700 --> 14:41.540]  or I read genetics or anything Rasta Jeff related.
[14:41.540 --> 14:43.740]  I appreciate and enjoy all of those people.
[14:43.740 --> 14:45.140]  So I love meeting you guys.
[14:45.140 --> 14:46.620]  And I'm sure I know Pedro and Dizzy.
[14:46.620 --> 14:48.540]  I know they love meeting people as well.
[14:48.540 --> 14:49.700]  You can see it on their faces.
[14:49.700 --> 14:52.940]  They light up and they smile and they've both got a genuine smile.
[14:52.940 --> 14:54.860]  It's not that, oh fuck, I got to talk to people.
[14:54.860 --> 14:55.860]  It's real.
[14:55.860 --> 14:57.140]  We go to those places to meet people.
[14:57.140 --> 14:58.820]  That's part of our, it's what we want to do.
[14:58.820 --> 14:59.820]  It's part of the job.
[14:59.820 --> 15:00.820]  It's part of the goal.
[15:00.820 --> 15:02.620]  It's part of the mission is to go meet our friends.
[15:02.620 --> 15:05.100]  Like I said, without you guys, we're just a bunch of weirdos.
[15:05.100 --> 15:06.100]  We're a family.
[15:06.100 --> 15:07.100]  We're trying to make a family.
[15:07.100 --> 15:08.100]  That's what we do there.
[15:08.500 --> 15:11.940]  So it was a really cool experience for us and it couldn't have been more, we couldn't
[15:11.940 --> 15:15.220]  have been more impressed with the Colorado cannabis community.
[15:15.220 --> 15:19.100]  You fly a thousand miles to attend these events and check out the local scene and you never
[15:19.100 --> 15:21.380]  know what to expect.
[15:21.380 --> 15:22.380]  That is very true.
[15:22.380 --> 15:27.180]  You spend a ton of money, you get a flight, you get a hotel, you get an Uber to the hotel,
[15:27.180 --> 15:28.660]  then you got to make it to the event.
[15:28.660 --> 15:31.860]  And then when you get there, you don't know if the people are going to be friendly, if
[15:31.860 --> 15:35.300]  they're going to be total dicks, if they act like rock stars, you don't know if the event
[15:35.300 --> 15:36.660]  is going to be a flop.
[15:36.660 --> 15:39.740]  It's a really big gamble when you don't know what you're getting into.
[15:39.740 --> 15:42.500]  Luckily, the Indo Expo has done very well.
[15:42.500 --> 15:45.380]  And my friend Giant Mike, who sent this message is very correct.
[15:45.380 --> 15:49.160]  The Colorado cannabis community is very welcoming.
[15:49.160 --> 15:52.860]  We love you guys coming here to visit us and hang out with us and be our friends.
[15:52.860 --> 15:55.620]  We get some weirdos that come, but we know how to dodge them and avoid them.
[15:55.620 --> 15:57.340]  But you guys that are cool, we love you guys.
[15:57.340 --> 15:58.340]  Come hang out, be our friends.
[15:58.340 --> 16:01.640]  I met so many wonderful people at the Indo Expo.
[16:01.640 --> 16:06.140]  This email goes on to say, we could never have felt more welcomed, not just by the people
[16:06.620 --> 16:12.020]  at the Expo, but by everyone we encountered in the cannabis community in Colorado.
[16:12.020 --> 16:13.060]  That's beautiful to hear.
[16:13.060 --> 16:17.780]  I'm glad my crew, my state, my people did a good job and made you feel welcome.
[16:17.780 --> 16:20.660]  I'm glad the Embracing Organics crew was kind to you.
[16:20.660 --> 16:25.380]  I wish I could have taken a dab with you in the dab bus, but that's just how it goes.
[16:25.380 --> 16:29.460]  Next time, next time I'll make somebody else work the booth while I go take some dabs,
[16:29.460 --> 16:30.980]  but everybody wants to find me at the booth.
[16:30.980 --> 16:32.540]  So it's kind of, I feel like I should be there.
[16:32.540 --> 16:34.200]  I'm sure you understand.
[16:34.200 --> 16:35.420]  This message does continue.
[16:35.420 --> 16:40.160]  It says, it was my fiance's first time and now she is asking me every day if my boss
[16:40.160 --> 16:43.840]  is going to let me off so we can go to the DGC cup.
[16:43.840 --> 16:44.840]  That is awesome.
[16:44.840 --> 16:49.340]  I am glad that your wife, your fiance, maybe your wife by now, I'm glad she enjoyed it
[16:49.340 --> 16:52.680]  enough to be eager to come back in April for the DGC cup.
[16:52.680 --> 16:55.820]  That's only been a three month gap, so she's already excited.
[16:55.820 --> 16:57.040]  I'm stoked for that.
[16:57.040 --> 16:59.220]  We will take a dab at the DGC cup.
[16:59.220 --> 17:02.500]  Trust me, that is at a consumption friendly event.
[17:02.500 --> 17:06.640]  I will have my own concentrates and my own rig available at the booth.
[17:06.640 --> 17:08.980]  I'll be taking dabs on a regular basis.
[17:08.980 --> 17:11.660]  So come join me, introduce yourself, say, what's up bro?
[17:11.660 --> 17:12.660]  I'm Giant Mike.
[17:12.660 --> 17:14.880]  It's time to take a dab and we will take a dab.
[17:14.880 --> 17:18.340]  I'll get you uncomfortably high if that's what you're looking for.
[17:18.340 --> 17:21.700]  It wraps up with, hopefully we make it out and get to do dabs with you.
[17:21.700 --> 17:23.180]  Yes, hopefully bro.
[17:23.180 --> 17:26.100]  Hopefully you get to make it to the dude grows cup.
[17:26.100 --> 17:30.340]  I can't tell you where it is yet, but it is in Denver and it is on April 18th and it will
[17:30.340 --> 17:35.740]  be very easy to get to if you've got a hotel just about anywhere in Denver.
[17:35.740 --> 17:38.660]  This message wraps up with, thanks again for everything you do, man.
[17:38.660 --> 17:41.380]  Then we got a fist bump and a green heart emoji.
[17:41.380 --> 17:44.020]  Big fist bump, more green hearts back at you, bro.
[17:44.020 --> 17:45.500]  Growers love, gang gang.
[17:45.500 --> 17:47.380]  They signed the message with Giant Mike.
[17:47.380 --> 17:51.340]  Hey Giant Mike, thank you for the continued correspondence.
[17:51.340 --> 17:55.140]  I think this is the second or third message I've read from you on the show.
[17:55.140 --> 17:56.940]  Big thanks for all of the support.
[17:56.940 --> 17:58.420]  You guys, I got to press pause and take a drink.
[17:58.420 --> 18:00.020]  My voice is doing that thing.
[18:00.220 --> 18:02.580]  I'll be right back after I get some hydration going on.
[18:02.580 --> 18:03.580]  Take a dab while I'm gone.
[18:03.580 --> 18:05.660]  All right, all right, all right, I'm back.
[18:05.660 --> 18:06.660]  Guess what?
[18:06.660 --> 18:10.340]  I hit some of that orange Skittles live batter from Apothecary Farms.
[18:10.340 --> 18:14.180]  The THC is 66.7% THC.
[18:14.180 --> 18:17.020]  Total cannabinoids is 77.2%.
[18:17.020 --> 18:21.060]  I'm cracking it open to give you guys an accurate smell description.
[18:21.060 --> 18:24.300]  As soon as I open it, it's funky oranges.
[18:24.300 --> 18:26.580]  I can't describe it better than funky oranges.
[18:26.580 --> 18:31.180]  It's orange, but there's something nasty to it that I really enjoy.
[18:31.180 --> 18:32.180]  Orange Skittles, you guys.
[18:32.180 --> 18:35.460]  Skittles with a Z so they don't get in any trouble.
[18:35.460 --> 18:37.180]  Live batter from Apothecary Farms.
[18:37.180 --> 18:38.420]  I'm digging it.
[18:38.420 --> 18:41.300]  The first thing I noticed is it made my eyes nice and heavy.
[18:41.300 --> 18:43.660]  I got those heavy eyeballs now.
[18:43.660 --> 18:47.780]  Big shout out to our friends at Apothecary Farms for getting me nicely stoned here on
[18:47.780 --> 18:48.780]  a podcast.
[18:48.780 --> 18:51.020]  I've got one more email that I'm going to read.
[18:51.020 --> 18:54.740]  This one comes from our friend who calls themselves David W. from STL.
[18:54.740 --> 18:55.740]  What up?
[18:55.900 --> 18:57.540]  Shout out to my friends in the STL.
[18:57.540 --> 19:00.300]  The message goes a lot just like this.
[19:00.300 --> 19:04.620]  It says, yo, Rasta Jeff, thank you for all of the knowledge you drop on us every week.
[19:04.620 --> 19:08.100]  You were doing great things for the community and the movement.
[19:08.100 --> 19:09.100]  Thank you, bro.
[19:09.100 --> 19:10.100]  That means a lot to me.
[19:10.100 --> 19:11.540]  I appreciate the words of encouragement.
[19:11.540 --> 19:14.500]  I'm out here trying to do what I can, man, just doing my part.
[19:14.500 --> 19:17.780]  So thank you for the motivation and for acknowledging my work.
[19:17.780 --> 19:19.380]  I do appreciate it.
[19:19.380 --> 19:21.420]  It goes on to say, here is my question.
[19:21.420 --> 19:27.180]  The supposed feminized seeds I got from a dude I know ended up being auto flowers.
[19:27.180 --> 19:32.300]  They are in my garden along with a few other photo period regs.
[19:32.300 --> 19:36.860]  Since the autos have started flowering, what effect would it have on them if I were to
[19:36.860 --> 19:43.260]  switch to a 12-12 light cycle for the photo period regulars to start flowering?
[19:43.260 --> 19:47.380]  Thanks again from your friend David W. from the STL.
[19:47.380 --> 19:48.860]  He says, you can use my name.
[19:48.860 --> 19:49.860]  Thank you.
[19:49.860 --> 19:52.500]  It's so much easier when you give me permission to use your name.
[19:52.500 --> 19:54.940]  All right, let's talk about this.
[19:54.940 --> 19:58.340]  Our new friend David was growing some seeds, which he thought were feminized.
[19:58.340 --> 20:02.580]  They are probably feminized, but it turns out that they are auto flowers.
[20:02.580 --> 20:06.680]  I'm assuming you think they're auto flowers because they have probably auto flowered while
[20:06.680 --> 20:10.500]  you've got them under a veg light situation.
[20:10.500 --> 20:14.900]  That may have been caused because they were root bound, but it is probably accurate that
[20:14.900 --> 20:15.900]  they are auto flowers.
[20:16.140 --> 20:20.260]  The main question is, he has got some other plants in there that he wants to put into
[20:20.260 --> 20:24.220]  the flower cycle, but they are photo period regular seeds.
[20:24.220 --> 20:27.620]  They are going to require a 12-12 light cycle.
[20:27.620 --> 20:33.460]  The auto flowering plants will do best under a 16-8 or 18-6 light cycle.
[20:33.460 --> 20:34.980]  I'm not an auto flower guy.
[20:34.980 --> 20:39.940]  I don't breed or grow auto flowers, so that time period may be off, but they do better
[20:39.940 --> 20:47.500]  with a longer photo period of daylight hours because they're bred to flower without a reduced
[20:47.500 --> 20:48.500]  light period.
[20:48.500 --> 20:53.940]  Now, what is going to happen if we reduce the lights to 12-12 to trigger our photo period
[20:53.940 --> 20:55.580]  seeds into flower?
[20:55.580 --> 21:00.540]  The main thing you will notice is that those auto flowers may slow down in growth a little
[21:00.540 --> 21:05.820]  bit because they are not getting as much light energy as they would prefer.
[21:05.820 --> 21:10.300]  They've been used to getting 18 or 16 hours worth of light all day, every day, and now
[21:10.300 --> 21:11.300]  you've cut that down.
[21:11.300 --> 21:15.180]  They're going to go, hey, I thought we were going to get more light than that, bro.
[21:15.180 --> 21:19.100]  They're going to act like they're not going to grow as rapidly and as vigorously.
[21:19.100 --> 21:21.380]  They may take a little bit longer to finish.
[21:21.380 --> 21:24.180]  Also, they may take a little bit shorter to finish.
[21:24.180 --> 21:28.100]  I'm not sure how they're going to respond to this, but you won't get as much growth
[21:28.100 --> 21:33.860]  as you would have because the light, the sun is the most effective, most desired nutrient
[21:33.860 --> 21:34.860]  for a plant.
[21:34.900 --> 21:38.460]  It's the most important building block for big buds, but we have to do the compromise.
[21:38.460 --> 21:42.500]  We have to reduce the light cycle enough to encourage the plants to flower so they think
[21:42.500 --> 21:46.540]  that the season is ending, but we also have to give them enough light to create big fat
[21:46.540 --> 21:47.540]  buds.
[21:47.540 --> 21:50.120]  So you can easily switch your lights to 12-12.
[21:50.120 --> 21:52.340]  Those auto flowers will continue to flower.
[21:52.340 --> 21:58.020]  You're just not going to see the productivity that you would hope to see from those plants.
[21:58.020 --> 22:00.980]  So my overall advice is to don't be scared.
[22:00.980 --> 22:05.780]  Put those plants on 12-12, get those photo period plants going, and then just move forward
[22:05.780 --> 22:07.420]  and get those autos out of there.
[22:07.420 --> 22:08.420]  That's an experience.
[22:08.420 --> 22:09.420]  That's something that happened.
[22:09.420 --> 22:13.060]  They're not going to be the most amazing plants, but you will get something out of them.
[22:13.060 --> 22:14.060]  Just let them finish.
[22:14.060 --> 22:16.020]  You may want to reduce the feed.
[22:16.020 --> 22:19.620]  They may not eat as much nutrients because they're not getting as much light.
[22:19.620 --> 22:24.600]  They can't metabolize and photosynthesize as much, so they're not going to be as active.
[22:24.600 --> 22:26.820]  They may not even drink as much for a little while.
[22:26.820 --> 22:30.780]  So pay attention to the plants, how they respond and how they react.
[22:31.580 --> 22:32.980]  I think everything will be okay.
[22:32.980 --> 22:35.540]  You're just not going to get as much productivity.
[22:35.540 --> 22:39.220]  Pay attention to the feeding, pay attention to the frequency and the strength of your
[22:39.220 --> 22:42.140]  feeding solution, and I think you will be just fine.
[22:42.140 --> 22:43.140]  All right.
[22:43.140 --> 22:46.620]  I want to thank my new friend, David W. from STL.
[22:46.620 --> 22:49.420]  I may have called you David from West STL.
[22:49.420 --> 22:51.700]  Either way, thanks for the great message, bro.
