[00:00.000 --> 00:02.200]  Hey, welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:02.200 --> 00:06.040]  It is time for episode 393 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:06.040 --> 00:09.040]  This episode is brought to you by Oregon Elite Seeds.
[00:09.040 --> 00:13.240]  If you're looking for new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds,
[00:13.240 --> 00:19.040]  and you can find them at www.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[00:19.040 --> 00:22.280]  I like to start the podcast off by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[00:22.280 --> 00:27.940]  I just took a ridiculous dab of Mandarin Sunset from Contraband Extracts, available at a cut
[00:27.940 --> 00:29.960]  above in Colorado Springs.
[00:29.960 --> 00:32.280]  This concentrate has a great aroma and flavor.
[00:32.280 --> 00:37.020]  It is sweet, orange, and candy with a hint of pepper and spice at the back end, and the
[00:37.020 --> 00:38.400]  high is tremendous.
[00:38.400 --> 00:39.940]  It goes straight to my head.
[00:39.940 --> 00:41.440]  It goes straight behind my eyes.
[00:41.440 --> 00:42.620]  It kind of makes it hard to think.
[00:42.620 --> 00:47.060]  It makes it hard to pay attention, but that is exactly what I'm looking for in a concentrate.
[00:47.060 --> 00:50.820]  So shout out to our friends at Contraband Extracts, and a big shout out to everyone
[00:50.820 --> 00:53.520]  at a cut above.
[00:53.520 --> 00:57.100]  If you have been following along with the podcast, you know I've been doing a long series
[00:57.100 --> 00:58.680]  of grow lessons.
[00:58.680 --> 01:00.560]  This is going to be another grow lesson.
[01:00.560 --> 01:03.920]  However, this is going to be a reposted episode.
[01:03.920 --> 01:07.940]  While back, I did an episode about trimming our freshly harvested cannabis.
[01:07.940 --> 01:11.280]  It was originally posted as episode 327.
[01:11.280 --> 01:16.520]  It falls right in line with our grow lessons, so I'm going to repost it as episode 393.
[01:16.520 --> 01:19.080]  I hope everybody enjoys this repost.
[01:19.080 --> 01:23.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, let's jump right in to trimming our freshly harvested cannabis.
[01:23.160 --> 01:26.160]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[01:26.160 --> 01:30.160]  It's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[01:30.160 --> 01:31.640]  news, education, and conversation.
[01:31.640 --> 01:36.160]  That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker
[01:36.160 --> 01:40.400]  or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who is just curious
[01:40.400 --> 01:44.560]  about the current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[01:44.560 --> 01:45.560]  I'm your host.
[01:45.560 --> 01:46.800]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:46.800 --> 01:49.960]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[01:49.960 --> 01:53.940]  This episode of the podcast is brought to you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[01:53.940 --> 01:58.320]  If you need new genetics for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[01:58.320 --> 02:01.820]  You can find them at dankseed.store.
[02:01.820 --> 02:05.940]  Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat joint, pack up the bong, or start heating up that
[02:05.940 --> 02:15.900]  dab rig because it's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:15.900 --> 02:17.060]  Welcome back, podcast world.
[02:17.060 --> 02:19.980]  It's time for episode 327 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:19.980 --> 02:20.980]  Thanks again for joining me.
[02:21.020 --> 02:24.220]  You know I like to start the episode off by letting you know what I'm smoking on.
[02:24.220 --> 02:30.780]  Today, I'm taking dabs of this New York City Diesel Ambrosia Batter from Apothecary Farms.
[02:30.780 --> 02:32.140]  I'm giving it a nice smell right now.
[02:32.140 --> 02:37.500]  This stuff smells like diesel fuel with a little bit of lemons, maybe a hint of oranges,
[02:37.500 --> 02:41.640]  and then there's kind of a sweet tart sort of smell on top of it that I really enjoy.
[02:41.640 --> 02:46.660]  One thing about the New York City Diesel Ambrosia Batter here that I'm smoking on, my eyes really
[02:46.660 --> 02:47.780]  don't get red when I smoke.
[02:47.780 --> 02:51.660]  I can smoke and I don't get red-eyed, but when I take one dab of this New York City
[02:51.660 --> 02:54.340]  Diesel, my eyes go fully bloodshot red.
[02:54.340 --> 02:56.740]  I'm not sure what does it, but I get super red.
[02:56.740 --> 02:59.820]  I get super head high from it and I really enjoy it.
[02:59.820 --> 03:04.740]  If that weren't enough, I've been adding this Sour Amnesia High Cannabinoid Full Spectrum
[03:04.740 --> 03:06.700]  Extract into the mix.
[03:06.700 --> 03:09.680]  It just adds a really nice ... It's like turbocharging my dab.
[03:09.680 --> 03:10.680]  It is really nice.
[03:10.680 --> 03:13.980]  I like the lung expansion and the flavor from the New York City Diesel.
[03:13.980 --> 03:18.020]  Then you put the High Cannabinoid Full Spectrum Extract on top and it really makes it like
[03:18.020 --> 03:20.140]  a turbocharged dab.
[03:20.140 --> 03:21.140]  I'm in the mood for a podcast.
[03:21.140 --> 03:22.540]  You guys, I feel super rambly.
[03:22.540 --> 03:24.420]  I feel like I got a lot of energy.
[03:24.420 --> 03:26.120]  Let's get into a podcast.
[03:26.120 --> 03:30.100]  This episode is going to be all about trimming your cannabis plants.
[03:30.100 --> 03:31.100]  That's right.
[03:31.100 --> 03:32.100]  We've learned how to tell when the plants are ripe.
[03:32.100 --> 03:33.620]  We've learned how to cut them down.
[03:33.620 --> 03:34.720]  We've learned how to harvest them.
[03:34.720 --> 03:36.860]  We learned how to hang them until they're ready to snap.
[03:36.860 --> 03:38.860]  We know pretty well how to dry and cure.
[03:38.860 --> 03:42.420]  Now let's talk about trimming our plants.
[03:42.420 --> 03:43.760]  There are two different ways you can trim.
[03:44.540 --> 03:45.920]  There's wet trim and there is dry trim.
[03:45.920 --> 03:48.200]  I definitely prefer dry trim.
[03:48.200 --> 03:50.920]  You're going to say, why is dry trim better?
[03:50.920 --> 03:57.120]  I think dry trim is better because it's less sticky and it's much easier to work with.
[03:57.120 --> 03:58.840]  It's also less work.
[03:58.840 --> 04:00.200]  The leaves are dry.
[04:00.200 --> 04:01.300]  Those leaves are going to fall off.
[04:01.300 --> 04:04.240]  All you have to do is just brush them with your thumb, maybe touch them with the scissors
[04:04.240 --> 04:07.120]  and those brittle leaves will come right off of there.
[04:07.120 --> 04:10.760]  The buds have dried and tightened up and it's a little more obvious for a new trimmer what
[04:10.760 --> 04:11.760]  to take off.
[04:11.760 --> 04:14.680]  You don't want to take off that fluffy outside shit.
[04:14.680 --> 04:15.680]  It's a little less work.
[04:15.680 --> 04:16.800]  It's less sticky.
[04:16.800 --> 04:21.120]  There's also less chance to ruin your buds by improperly storing them.
[04:21.120 --> 04:24.440]  A lot of people, once the buds are trimmed, if they wet trim, they like to just shove
[04:24.440 --> 04:28.700]  them into a container or a package and then those wet buds go into a container and that's
[04:28.700 --> 04:30.420]  when they get ruined.
[04:30.420 --> 04:31.680]  We're not even going to let that happen.
[04:31.680 --> 04:33.280]  We're going to let the buds dry.
[04:33.280 --> 04:34.320]  Then we're going to trim them.
[04:34.320 --> 04:36.200]  Then we'll put them in a container.
[04:36.200 --> 04:38.740]  A lot of people have listened to the dry and curing episode.
[04:38.740 --> 04:42.640]  You may be trimming these buds before they go into the jar for cure.
[04:42.640 --> 04:45.540]  You may be trimming these buds after they've been in the cure jar for a little while.
[04:45.540 --> 04:46.620]  It's all the same process.
[04:46.620 --> 04:48.940]  The leaves should be similar in dryness.
[04:48.940 --> 04:50.700]  They should just be popping right off of there.
[04:50.700 --> 04:53.060]  You might not even need scissors for this.
[04:53.060 --> 04:56.500]  Sometimes when I'm dry trimming, the only thing I use my scissors for is for cutting
[04:56.500 --> 05:00.180]  the plant into smaller pieces and cutting the sticks out and cutting the bigger buds
[05:00.180 --> 05:02.380]  down to smaller buds.
[05:02.380 --> 05:06.640]  Now let's talk about a few preparations we can make and a few items we can have to create
[05:06.640 --> 05:10.200]  a comfortable and successful trim environment for ourselves.
[05:10.200 --> 05:11.200]  Trimming sucks.
[05:11.200 --> 05:12.200]  It's going to take a long time.
[05:12.200 --> 05:16.840]  You're sitting in a chair with your elbows up high staring straight into something for
[05:16.840 --> 05:17.840]  a long time.
[05:17.840 --> 05:23.200]  Your neck, your elbows, your eyes, your back, that stuff all gets sore and tired.
[05:23.200 --> 05:25.680]  Let's try to make it as comfortable as possible.
[05:25.680 --> 05:27.200]  I like to have a nice clean space.
[05:27.200 --> 05:28.960]  I've got this table where I like to do my work.
[05:28.960 --> 05:30.400]  I clean the whole table off.
[05:30.400 --> 05:34.600]  There's nothing on the table except my Dr. Pepper and some trim supplies, maybe my phone
[05:34.600 --> 05:36.120]  for some entertainment.
[05:36.120 --> 05:37.120]  It's just there for music.
[05:37.120 --> 05:38.120]  I'm not going to be touching it.
[05:38.120 --> 05:39.760]  Don't have your phone out if you're trimming, you guys.
[05:39.760 --> 05:41.560]  It's so fucking distracting and it will slow you down.
[05:41.560 --> 05:42.560]  It'll take twice as long.
[05:42.560 --> 05:45.400]  Put on a podcast, hit play, start fucking trimming.
[05:45.400 --> 05:47.200]  Anyway, I like to have the table nice and clean.
[05:47.200 --> 05:48.520]  I don't need shit in my way.
[05:48.520 --> 05:52.760]  I need maybe my scissors for cutting my buds into smaller pieces and then just a few basic
[05:52.760 --> 05:54.520]  essentials and we'll talk about those.
[05:54.520 --> 05:55.680]  A nice clean space.
[05:55.680 --> 05:57.880]  I also like a nice comfortable chair.
[05:57.880 --> 05:59.600]  You're going to be sitting there for a while.
[05:59.600 --> 06:01.160]  Get a cozy chair.
[06:01.160 --> 06:05.000]  So a nice clean workspace and a cozy chair are super important for me for trimming, but
[06:05.080 --> 06:07.360]  then you need some sort of entertainment.
[06:07.360 --> 06:09.200]  Hopefully you got somebody there to talk to.
[06:09.200 --> 06:11.680]  Usually I got Mike or somebody around to bullshit with.
[06:11.680 --> 06:15.960]  Some sort of conversation makes trimming go much more smoothly, but if you don't have
[06:15.960 --> 06:17.640]  that option, put on a podcast.
[06:17.640 --> 06:19.080]  You guys, I like to put on a podcast.
[06:19.080 --> 06:22.480]  Of course, I recommend old episodes of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[06:22.480 --> 06:24.520]  Put on some Joe Rogan, something like that.
[06:24.520 --> 06:28.480]  Maybe a YouTube video, something to entertain yourself to listen to, but nothing to look
[06:28.480 --> 06:29.480]  at.
[06:29.480 --> 06:32.960]  Back in the day, we used to trim all around the TV and we would watch YouTube videos and
[06:32.960 --> 06:33.960]  trim.
[06:33.960 --> 06:36.880]  If you're a person that is super distracting, don't watch videos.
[06:36.880 --> 06:39.640]  People will put their fucking scissors down and you'll catch them just watching TV.
[06:39.640 --> 06:42.600]  If you're paying people to trim, don't have a TV in the room.
[06:42.600 --> 06:45.280]  Podcasts, maybe some standup comedy.
[06:45.280 --> 06:48.080]  It's hard to get everybody on the same page when it comes to music, but maybe play some
[06:48.080 --> 06:49.200]  good music.
[06:49.200 --> 06:52.640]  Just some sort of stuff to make it comfortable and help the time pass without your brain
[06:52.640 --> 06:54.440]  going crazy is what I'm getting at you guys.
[06:54.440 --> 06:55.440]  So you got a clean space.
[06:55.440 --> 06:56.440]  You got a chair to sit in.
[06:56.440 --> 06:57.720]  You got a good YouTube video on.
[06:57.720 --> 06:58.720]  You got a podcast going.
[06:58.720 --> 06:59.800]  So now you're cozy.
[06:59.800 --> 07:00.800]  Your mind is entertained.
[07:00.800 --> 07:02.360]  Now you need some gloves.
[07:02.360 --> 07:04.000]  Put some rubber gloves on.
[07:04.000 --> 07:05.440]  You want to wear gloves when you're trimming.
[07:05.440 --> 07:08.120]  You're going to get extremely sticky.
[07:08.120 --> 07:11.080]  You don't want to have to itch your face and have to go wash your hands just to scratch
[07:11.080 --> 07:12.280]  your face.
[07:12.280 --> 07:14.880]  You're going to be, your hands are going to be covered in trichomes and resin.
[07:14.880 --> 07:17.320]  You guys wear gloves.
[07:17.320 --> 07:18.440]  Also you need some good scissors.
[07:18.440 --> 07:22.700]  I like the little tiny Fiskars diamond tip scissors that you get.
[07:22.700 --> 07:23.920]  They're expensive at the growth store.
[07:23.920 --> 07:25.120]  They're cheaper at Hobby Lobby.
[07:25.120 --> 07:26.760]  They sell them in the craft section.
[07:26.760 --> 07:28.120]  Right the craft section at Hobby Lobby.
[07:28.120 --> 07:29.120]  That's all of Hobby Lobby.
[07:29.360 --> 07:32.320]  They sell them in the fabric section over by the fabric.
[07:32.320 --> 07:34.800]  There are Fiskars diamond tip titanium scissors.
[07:34.800 --> 07:36.320]  I really like those.
[07:36.320 --> 07:37.600]  They work really well for trimming.
[07:37.600 --> 07:38.600]  They're super light.
[07:38.600 --> 07:41.240]  Get something with a spring in it that opens on its own because you don't want to have
[07:41.240 --> 07:43.140]  to be opening and closing scissors.
[07:43.140 --> 07:45.640]  You don't want the kind of scissors that have loops that go around your fingers because
[07:45.640 --> 07:47.120]  you're going to be cutting for so long.
[07:47.120 --> 07:49.640]  Those little loops around your fingers are going to dig into you.
[07:49.640 --> 07:53.200]  You just want lightweight, super fast trimming shears.
[07:53.200 --> 07:55.080]  They're easy to find and they're affordable.
[07:55.080 --> 07:58.760]  You can get yourselves two pair so that you can set one in the rubbing alcohol to clean
[07:58.760 --> 07:59.760]  off.
[07:59.760 --> 08:02.440]  You can dirty up another pair, swap them out real quick, not have to spend a lot of time
[08:02.440 --> 08:03.440]  cleaning your scissors.
[08:03.440 --> 08:06.160]  You need some good gloves, some good scissors.
[08:06.160 --> 08:08.240]  Then you need some containers.
[08:08.240 --> 08:10.320]  You need a container for untrimmed buds.
[08:10.320 --> 08:13.400]  I recommend a five gallon bucket for the untrimmed buds.
[08:13.400 --> 08:14.720]  Maybe you don't have that much herb.
[08:14.720 --> 08:16.480]  Maybe something smaller will work.
[08:16.480 --> 08:19.280]  Then you need another container for trimmed buds.
[08:19.280 --> 08:22.440]  Then you need another container for saveable trim.
[08:22.440 --> 08:24.800]  Then we need another container for waste.
[08:24.800 --> 08:29.280]  You need trimmed buds, untrimmed buds, usable trim, and waste.
[08:29.280 --> 08:31.680]  A couple of other things I'm going to recommend and you're going to say, why the hell would
[08:31.680 --> 08:33.320]  he recommend this for a grow?
[08:33.320 --> 08:37.240]  I would recommend either some coconut oil or some baby oil for your trim session.
[08:37.240 --> 08:39.440]  You're going to say, why do we need that?
[08:39.440 --> 08:40.720]  Here is why.
[08:40.720 --> 08:44.760]  When your fingers and hands and arms get all sticky, you can use the coconut oil or the
[08:44.760 --> 08:46.360]  baby oil to remove the trichomes.
[08:46.360 --> 08:47.360]  That's right.
[08:47.360 --> 08:50.640]  If your hands are all covered in resin, my thing is that my arms get covered in resin
[08:50.640 --> 08:51.920]  because I'm the one cutting down the plants.
[08:51.920 --> 08:54.240]  I'm reaching in there and playing with them and carrying them around.
[08:54.680 --> 08:58.120]  My arm hair and shit gets all coated in trichomes and plant resin.
[08:58.120 --> 09:02.200]  I use the coconut oil or baby oil to just rub up on my arms and rub that shit right
[09:02.200 --> 09:03.800]  off and all the resin comes right off.
[09:03.800 --> 09:06.240]  Then you're not all sticky.
[09:06.240 --> 09:10.080]  That's a basic breakdown of things that you're going to need for your trim session.
[09:10.080 --> 09:11.860]  You need a nice clean space in which to work.
[09:11.860 --> 09:13.760]  You need a nice cozy chair in which to sit.
[09:13.760 --> 09:17.480]  You need a good podcast to listen to, probably the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[09:17.480 --> 09:18.480]  Then you need some gloves.
[09:18.480 --> 09:19.480]  You need scissors.
[09:19.480 --> 09:20.480]  Then you need your containers.
[09:20.480 --> 09:21.920]  Then you've got your cleanup supplies.
[09:22.040 --> 09:24.280]  Now let's talk about doing the manual work.
[09:24.280 --> 09:29.280]  Hopefully, a few days before harvest, you went in and did a pre-harvest defoliation.
[09:29.280 --> 09:33.400]  What I mean by that is while the plants are still alive, while you're flushing, anywhere
[09:33.400 --> 09:37.920]  between seven days before harvest up to the day of harvest, you can go in there and just
[09:37.920 --> 09:40.720]  start pulling off all of the big leaves.
[09:40.720 --> 09:41.800]  The plants are done growing.
[09:41.800 --> 09:42.800]  They're just flushing out.
[09:42.800 --> 09:43.800]  They're just finishing up.
[09:43.800 --> 09:44.800]  The trichomes are ripening up.
[09:44.800 --> 09:46.760]  You don't need all that excess leaf in there.
[09:46.760 --> 09:49.760]  Just go ahead and tear all that leaf out of the room.
[09:49.760 --> 09:53.760]  Doing a pre-harvest defoliation session will save you a lot of time when it comes time
[09:53.760 --> 09:58.440]  to trim because all of that long, straggly leaf is already gone.
[09:58.440 --> 09:59.520]  It's not even there to deal with.
[09:59.520 --> 10:00.720]  It's already been removed.
[10:00.720 --> 10:03.940]  It will also help your drying and curing time.
[10:03.940 --> 10:06.760]  Go in and pull off all the big leaves before you harvest.
[10:06.760 --> 10:07.760]  Then it's harvest time.
[10:07.760 --> 10:10.120]  I've done a highly detailed harvest episode.
[10:10.120 --> 10:14.120]  If you haven't listened to that, go listen to that, then come catch up.
[10:14.120 --> 10:18.240]  At the end of the harvest episode, we're left with our plants hanging upside down in a controlled
[10:18.240 --> 10:19.240]  environment.
[10:19.240 --> 10:21.960]  You want those plants to get to where the sticks snap.
[10:21.960 --> 10:25.080]  Once the sticks get snappy, you can start trimming.
[10:25.080 --> 10:28.880]  You can also start trimming them after they've been in their cure containers for a little
[10:28.880 --> 10:29.880]  while.
[10:29.880 --> 10:30.880]  I like dry trim.
[10:30.880 --> 10:34.960]  I'm just waiting for the buds to be dry enough to where the leaves just flake right off.
[10:34.960 --> 10:36.840]  There's still going to be moisture inside those buds.
[10:36.840 --> 10:41.040]  There's moisture in the middle, but the outside is dry enough to where you can just knock
[10:41.040 --> 10:42.920]  the leaves off the buds with your thumb.
[10:42.920 --> 10:46.480]  I'm making a little motion with my hands that sort of looks like I'm playing a video game.
[10:46.480 --> 10:49.840]  I've got a game controller in my hand, but my hands are really close together.
[10:49.840 --> 10:53.920]  In my mind, I'm just holding that little bud with my forefingers or maybe with my left
[10:53.920 --> 10:58.120]  hand and I'm just knocking the leaves off with my right hand.
[10:58.120 --> 11:00.400]  It looks like I'm playing a video game.
[11:00.400 --> 11:02.960]  I'm just holding the bud and just rubbing the leaves right off.
[11:02.960 --> 11:06.480]  If you hold it with the bud facing up, if you rub down, those leaves will just rub right
[11:06.480 --> 11:07.480]  off.
[11:07.480 --> 11:09.160]  You'll see what I'm talking about when you figure out the technique.
[11:09.160 --> 11:11.200]  You go, man, that is so easy.
[11:11.200 --> 11:13.720]  My point is that I want it to where the buds are dry.
[11:13.720 --> 11:15.760]  I want to be able to just knock those leaves right off.
[11:15.760 --> 11:19.000]  Here is how I actually do my trimming.
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.480]  Whenever I'm working with the plants, I like to wear gloves.
[11:21.480 --> 11:24.120]  Step one of trimming is put on some rubber gloves.
[11:24.120 --> 11:26.080]  I like the six millimeter nitrile gloves.
[11:26.080 --> 11:27.080]  I don't care if they're black.
[11:27.080 --> 11:28.080]  I don't care if they're blue.
[11:28.080 --> 11:30.940]  I just care that they fit and that they're comfortable.
[11:30.940 --> 11:31.940]  Glove up.
[11:31.940 --> 11:36.100]  I don't want to get all sticky and also I don't want to get my skin all over the buds.
[11:36.100 --> 11:37.680]  Step one is glove up.
[11:37.680 --> 11:42.520]  Step two of trimming is to knock all of the buds off of the sticks into a five gallon
[11:42.520 --> 11:43.520]  bucket.
[11:43.520 --> 11:44.720]  This makes it so much easier.
[11:44.720 --> 11:49.320]  Just go and get every bud off the sticks into a bucket and then discard all the sticks.
[11:49.320 --> 11:52.560]  Now you've compressed your work into a much smaller space.
[11:52.560 --> 11:56.040]  It looks way less overwhelming and you can see what you've got ahead of you.
[11:56.040 --> 11:59.520]  You've got a five gallon bucket filled with buds that you need to trim.
[11:59.520 --> 12:03.480]  It doesn't look like this big sprawl of branches and leaves and shit everywhere.
[12:03.480 --> 12:04.480]  Just a bucket.
[12:04.480 --> 12:07.200]  It's way less intimidating and you can get through it.
[12:07.200 --> 12:09.680]  Knock all the buds into a bucket.
[12:09.680 --> 12:11.320]  Maybe you can use just a small bowl.
[12:11.320 --> 12:12.720]  Maybe you can use something smaller.
[12:12.720 --> 12:14.040]  I'm not sure how much you grew.
[12:14.040 --> 12:15.040]  Maybe you need five buckets.
[12:15.040 --> 12:19.040]  I hope you need 10 or 25 gallon buckets, but find the container that's the right size for
[12:19.040 --> 12:20.040]  what you need.
[12:20.040 --> 12:24.520]  A five gallon bucket from Home Depot or Lowe's is really affordable and they're disposable,
[12:24.520 --> 12:26.480]  so I like to use the buckets.
[12:26.480 --> 12:29.440]  I knock every bud into a bucket.
[12:29.440 --> 12:31.720]  Now I've got a five gallon bucket full of buds.
[12:31.720 --> 12:36.600]  My next step is just to reach in, grab the bud off the top and start trimming.
[12:36.600 --> 12:40.120]  Now I'll actually start talking about trimming a little bit and the actual trimming of the
[12:40.120 --> 12:41.560]  bud process.
[12:41.560 --> 12:46.320]  The idea is to knock or cut off all of the excessive leaves and stems and give yourself
[12:46.320 --> 12:49.920]  a nice, pretty, presentable bud.
[12:49.920 --> 12:52.000]  You guys know what a good trimmed bud looks like.
[12:52.000 --> 12:54.080]  When they start off, they're covered in leaves.
[12:54.080 --> 12:56.520]  It's our job to knock those leaves off.
[12:56.520 --> 12:57.780]  We don't want to smoke leaves.
[12:57.780 --> 12:59.340]  Leaves contain chlorophyll.
[12:59.340 --> 13:00.560]  Leaves don't taste good.
[13:00.560 --> 13:01.560]  Leaves don't get you high.
[13:01.560 --> 13:06.640]  What we want is a nice, frosty, green nugget.
[13:06.640 --> 13:10.200]  Once you guys get started trimming, you'll see what's leaf material and what is a usable
[13:10.200 --> 13:11.200]  bud.
[13:11.360 --> 13:13.360]  Once you guys get in there and just start knocking off some of the leaf, you'll find
[13:13.360 --> 13:17.720]  that bud in the middle and it will start to become very obvious what you do and do not
[13:17.720 --> 13:18.720]  trim.
[13:18.720 --> 13:21.960]  If your buds are airy and fluffy, don't trim too deeply.
[13:21.960 --> 13:23.440]  Just knock off the leaves.
[13:23.440 --> 13:27.120]  I like to grab the bud by the base, by that little stick at the bottom of the bud and
[13:27.120 --> 13:29.160]  just use my thumb to push the leaves off.
[13:29.160 --> 13:32.160]  I just spin the bud in a circle with my left hand.
[13:32.160 --> 13:33.160]  I will turn it.
[13:33.160 --> 13:34.160]  I'm looking that's counterclockwise.
[13:34.160 --> 13:35.160]  No, that is clockwise.
[13:35.160 --> 13:39.320]  I'll turn the bud clockwise and as it comes toward me, I'll use my right thumb.
[13:39.320 --> 13:41.680]  I'm using my left hand to spin the bud toward me.
[13:41.680 --> 13:46.000]  As that one side comes toward me, my thumb just knocks the leaves off right there.
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.120]  I'm just wiping them off like I'm just scraping the leaves off.
[13:49.120 --> 13:51.800]  They're so dry that they knock off on their own.
[13:51.800 --> 13:55.160]  Don't press so hard that you're fucking up the shape of the bud and knocking off trichomes.
[13:55.160 --> 13:56.840]  You can do this really gently.
[13:56.840 --> 13:59.320]  You'll find the technique after you do it a few times.
[13:59.320 --> 14:02.000]  It'll be really comfortable and you'll get really fast at it.
[14:02.000 --> 14:03.720]  A lot of people like to do this with scissors.
[14:03.720 --> 14:07.160]  They'll hold it in their left hand and they'll take their scissors and just turn it and trim
[14:07.160 --> 14:08.160]  it.
[14:08.160 --> 14:09.440]  You can even spin off horizontally.
[14:09.440 --> 14:11.160]  Just keep your scissors horizontal.
[14:11.160 --> 14:13.440]  You can adjust your angle as you need.
[14:13.440 --> 14:15.880]  Just spin that bud and keep cutting just like you're giving it a haircut.
[14:15.880 --> 14:19.000]  You just want to take off those leaves and leave that bud there.
[14:19.000 --> 14:20.960]  Just knock off the leaves.
[14:20.960 --> 14:24.480]  Don't carve too deeply into the buds and don't squish the buds while you're trimming them.
[14:24.480 --> 14:27.600]  Don't squeeze them super hard and try not to handle them too much.
[14:27.600 --> 14:29.740]  A little tiny bud doesn't need a lot of handling.
[14:29.740 --> 14:32.120]  You don't want to get all those trichomes on your gloves.
[14:32.120 --> 14:34.880]  You want to leave the trichomes on the buds.
[14:34.880 --> 14:36.080]  You can use scissors if you want.
[14:36.080 --> 14:38.280]  I like my thumbs for most trimming.
[14:38.280 --> 14:41.160]  The little edge of my thumb and my thumbnail is a perfect little trimmer for me.
[14:41.160 --> 14:43.080]  I've mastered that technique.
[14:43.080 --> 14:46.480]  I knock off the little leaves and cut the big buds into smaller sizes.
[14:46.480 --> 14:50.640]  If you guys can see a stick in there and it's like one bud and then a little stick and another
[14:50.640 --> 14:51.720]  bud, take that shit out.
[14:51.720 --> 14:53.720]  Nobody wants to buy a stick.
[14:53.720 --> 14:57.120]  Connoisseur quality bud is taken down to the small part.
[14:57.120 --> 15:00.160]  If you want to leave your buds in big buds, that's fine.
[15:00.160 --> 15:01.680]  It's up to you.
[15:01.680 --> 15:02.960]  I like them smaller.
[15:02.960 --> 15:04.800]  A lot of people don't want to buy a big stick.
[15:05.800 --> 15:07.560]  You'll have some customers that want big buds.
[15:07.560 --> 15:10.120]  I used to have people that just wanted big buds.
[15:10.120 --> 15:11.120]  Some people know better.
[15:11.120 --> 15:14.800]  They're like, man, I don't want to buy that quarter, that one bud that weighs a quarter
[15:14.800 --> 15:18.120]  because I know right up the middle of it is a gram of stick and I'm getting ripped off.
[15:18.120 --> 15:19.120]  Some people want it.
[15:19.120 --> 15:20.120]  Some people don't.
[15:20.120 --> 15:22.360]  That's up to you.
[15:22.360 --> 15:27.320]  Once you've got it trimmed up to the size you want it and the amount of trim you want,
[15:27.320 --> 15:30.480]  I cut off all the little leaves at the bottom also.
[15:30.480 --> 15:32.760]  A lot of people leave little cabbage-y looking leaves at the bottom.
[15:32.760 --> 15:34.140]  I cut that shit off.
[15:34.140 --> 15:35.140]  I call it cabbage.
[15:35.140 --> 15:37.460]  I also take out the handlebar sticks.
[15:37.460 --> 15:41.060]  On the bottom, you're going to have the branch that the bud was actually stuck to the branch
[15:41.060 --> 15:42.060]  to.
[15:42.060 --> 15:44.380]  Then there's two little sticks that come out that those first leaves were attached to and
[15:44.380 --> 15:45.780]  they're all dry and shitty looking.
[15:45.780 --> 15:47.060]  Cut those off of there.
[15:47.060 --> 15:51.460]  If you've got a pound of weed and you've got all those little tiny sticks in there, those
[15:51.460 --> 15:53.340]  little sticks make your pound look like shit.
[15:53.340 --> 15:55.420]  Just take it out and your pound is going to look so much better.
[15:55.420 --> 15:57.220]  It's going to be so much more desirable.
[15:57.220 --> 15:59.140]  It's going to get you more money.
[15:59.140 --> 16:00.140]  That's the bottom line here.
[16:00.140 --> 16:02.260]  Trim it and it's worth more money.
[16:02.260 --> 16:03.580]  Take off all the leaves.
[16:03.580 --> 16:05.380]  Take off that little stick at the bottom.
[16:05.380 --> 16:06.560]  Knock off all the crow's feet.
[16:06.560 --> 16:10.620]  If you've got a little tiny pointy leaf sticking out of somewhere, cut that out or knock it
[16:10.620 --> 16:11.680]  off with your thumb.
[16:11.680 --> 16:14.100]  Those little triangle leaves make you look lazy.
[16:14.100 --> 16:17.420]  If you did a whole good job on most of the bud and you just left one or two little triangles
[16:17.420 --> 16:19.300]  at the tip, you look lazy.
[16:19.300 --> 16:21.460]  Take that stuff out of there.
[16:21.460 --> 16:25.740]  While I'm doing this, all the trimming work, I trim over a tray or a container to catch
[16:25.740 --> 16:27.100]  what I trim off.
[16:27.100 --> 16:31.140]  All that little stuff that gets clipped off is going to be used to make concentrates or
[16:31.140 --> 16:33.380]  edibles in the future.
[16:33.380 --> 16:34.660]  Gather all that stuff up.
[16:34.660 --> 16:35.660]  Take care of it.
[16:35.660 --> 16:37.940]  Don't just trim into the floor and then sweep it up.
[16:37.940 --> 16:39.780]  Don't trim onto the table and then scoop it up.
[16:39.780 --> 16:40.780]  Trim onto a tray.
[16:40.780 --> 16:44.280]  Trim into a container so that it is kept clean so it's treated with respect because it may
[16:44.280 --> 16:46.020]  go into edibles.
[16:46.020 --> 16:49.060]  Things that you're going to eat need to be treated with respect.
[16:49.060 --> 16:51.320]  Things you're going to smoke need to be treated with respect.
[16:51.320 --> 16:52.940]  This is our medicine.
[16:52.940 --> 16:54.980]  Gather this stuff up and vacuum seal it.
[16:54.980 --> 16:59.480]  I like to keep the trim in a vacuum sealed bag in the dark until I'm able to use it.
[16:59.480 --> 17:02.460]  Get that to your extractor as soon as you can.
[17:02.540 --> 17:04.740]  The sticks, those are thrown away.
[17:04.740 --> 17:06.460]  I throw all the sticks away.
[17:06.460 --> 17:08.260]  In a commercial grow, they're thrown away.
[17:08.260 --> 17:12.100]  In a home grow, those should go to the compost pile or they could be burned or something.
[17:12.100 --> 17:14.100]  The sticks are trash.
[17:14.100 --> 17:15.920]  Don't try to extract sticks, you guys.
[17:15.920 --> 17:16.920]  That's a waste of time.
[17:16.920 --> 17:18.000]  It's a waste of energy.
[17:18.000 --> 17:19.700]  You're not going to get anything out of it.
[17:19.700 --> 17:24.260]  Also, if you're adding the sticks to the trim, you're just making the hash worse.
[17:24.260 --> 17:26.900]  You're not making it better.
[17:26.900 --> 17:28.060]  What goes in comes out.
[17:28.060 --> 17:32.020]  If you just put shit in to make more, you're going to get more, but it's going to be shit.
[17:33.020 --> 17:38.860]  Gather up all your trim, vacuum seal the trim, keep the trim in a dark place, and get that
[17:38.860 --> 17:41.860]  to somebody that can turn that into concentrates for you.
[17:41.860 --> 17:47.820]  Also, if you've got yellow or brown or funky leaves that are falling off as you're trimming,
[17:47.820 --> 17:48.820]  separate those.
[17:48.820 --> 17:50.140]  Pull those out of the trim.
[17:50.140 --> 17:51.820]  Don't send that to the extractor.
[17:51.820 --> 17:53.240]  That's going to make your hash dark.
[17:53.240 --> 17:54.980]  It's going to make your hash taste like shit.
[17:54.980 --> 17:58.360]  It's going to make it less potent, and it's going to make it less desirable.
[17:58.360 --> 18:03.240]  Do a little work, clean it up, get it out of there, and you will have a better product.
[18:03.240 --> 18:06.780]  Use your thumbs or some scissors to gently remove the excess leaves and the little stems
[18:06.780 --> 18:07.780]  from the buds.
[18:07.780 --> 18:08.780]  Get rid of the handlebars.
[18:08.780 --> 18:10.160]  Get rid of the crow's feet.
[18:10.160 --> 18:14.920]  Once the buds are trimmed to your satisfaction, you can place them into a container for finished
[18:14.920 --> 18:15.920]  products.
[18:15.920 --> 18:19.160]  When I say to your satisfaction, how you want to trim your buds is up to you.
[18:19.160 --> 18:21.320]  If you want to leave it a little fluffy, go for it.
[18:21.320 --> 18:23.680]  If you want to trim it nice and tight, go for it.
[18:23.680 --> 18:25.800]  That is up to you.
[18:25.840 --> 18:29.640]  If your product is for you personally, then you can leave it as leafy as you want.
[18:29.640 --> 18:32.000]  You can knock those leaves off right before you smoke it.
[18:32.000 --> 18:33.300]  You can clean it up yourself.
[18:33.300 --> 18:37.520]  If you plan on getting top dollar for your product, you'll need to have a tight, clean
[18:37.520 --> 18:39.120]  trim job.
[18:39.120 --> 18:42.560]  One thing I should mention that will help us speed up the process of trimming is the
[18:42.560 --> 18:43.560]  rule of thumb.
[18:43.560 --> 18:47.480]  If the bud you are trimming is not bigger than the tip of your thumb, it's probably
[18:47.480 --> 18:52.060]  better to let that bud go to your hash pile and trim something more substantial.
[18:52.060 --> 18:55.780]  Put those little popcorn buds in the hash pile, put it in your trim pile, and you can
[18:55.780 --> 18:59.300]  make better hash that will improve the quality of your concentrate.
[18:59.300 --> 19:01.620]  If it's a little tiny bud, don't waste time trimming it.
[19:01.620 --> 19:03.660]  Just throw it in the hash pile.
[19:03.660 --> 19:05.460]  Don't waste your time trimming little tiny buds.
[19:05.460 --> 19:10.040]  If you feel like that little tiny bud is worth less money than the time it is taking you
[19:10.040 --> 19:13.020]  to trim it, set it aside and put it in the hash pile.
[19:13.020 --> 19:14.540]  You don't have to trim that.
[19:14.540 --> 19:21.140]  If herb costs $10 a gram and it takes you a minute to trim that little nug, it's not
[19:21.140 --> 19:22.140]  cost effective.
[19:22.140 --> 19:24.140]  Toss that little nug into the trim bin.
[19:24.140 --> 19:25.420]  We'll add that to the concentrates.
[19:25.420 --> 19:29.660]  Grab something that we can trim and get on the shelf and make it purchasable for the
[19:29.660 --> 19:31.280]  consumer.
[19:31.280 --> 19:33.680]  If it's real tiny, if it's ugly, don't bother trimming it.
[19:33.680 --> 19:35.800]  You can put that in your hash pile.
[19:35.800 --> 19:40.620]  You can add that to the to-be-extracted pile, and that will just improve your concentrates.
[19:40.620 --> 19:42.100]  It will also speed you up.
[19:42.100 --> 19:46.740]  Of course, if you need every little half gram, every piece of gravel out of that crop to
[19:46.740 --> 19:49.580]  make your goal, to make your weight, go ahead and trim that up.
[19:49.580 --> 19:50.580]  Add that.
[19:50.580 --> 19:52.620]  Put that in the bottom of the bag.
[19:52.620 --> 19:56.220]  If it's not necessary, if it's just for you, put that in the concentrate pile and speed
[19:56.220 --> 19:57.220]  yourself up.
[19:57.220 --> 20:03.260]  In a commercial grow, the growers are expected to kick out a pound minimum per person per
[20:03.260 --> 20:04.260]  shift.
[20:04.260 --> 20:05.900]  Some people turn in two pounds every day.
[20:05.900 --> 20:09.340]  If they spend time trimming that little gravel shit, they would never get there.
[20:09.340 --> 20:11.820]  We have a way of separating all those little tiny buds.
[20:11.820 --> 20:13.300]  All that little stuff gets filtered out.
[20:13.300 --> 20:15.460]  It gets pushed to the side.
[20:15.460 --> 20:20.020]  All of that, those little buds and the trim, they're combined, and it gets turned into
[20:20.460 --> 20:24.260]  a nice, tight trim if you want to sell it, but don't go overboard.
[20:24.260 --> 20:27.500]  Don't trim it too tight, and also don't try trimming all those little buds, or you're
[20:27.500 --> 20:28.980]  going to put yourself in debt.
[20:28.980 --> 20:30.380]  You've got to pay your trimmers.
[20:30.380 --> 20:31.740]  You're spending your time.
[20:31.740 --> 20:32.740]  Make it cost-effective.
[20:32.740 --> 20:36.420]  Now, something I want to mention, trimming will be very strain-dependent.
[20:36.420 --> 20:38.420]  Some buds are tight.
[20:38.420 --> 20:40.580]  Some buds are real fluffy.
[20:40.580 --> 20:42.700]  Some buds are little compacted little rocks.
[20:42.700 --> 20:45.820]  You can just rub your fingers over those, and those are going to trim.
[20:45.820 --> 20:49.060]  Some buds are airy and have a lot of texture to them.
[20:49.100 --> 20:51.420]  Trimmers are going to be a little harder to trim because you don't want to knock off all
[20:51.420 --> 20:52.420]  those calyxes.
[20:52.420 --> 20:53.900]  You're going to have to adjust.
[20:53.900 --> 20:57.780]  Also, if you're working for somebody else, you're going to have to adjust to how they
[20:57.780 --> 20:59.020]  want it trimmed.
[20:59.020 --> 21:02.820]  When you go to a grow and you're working for someone else, they get to dictate how tight
[21:02.820 --> 21:04.100]  your trim is.
[21:04.100 --> 21:05.180]  Don't over-trim.
[21:05.180 --> 21:06.180]  Don't under-trim.
[21:06.180 --> 21:07.460]  You trim to their expectation.
[21:07.460 --> 21:10.700]  If you're not sure what they want, have them trim up a bud and show you.
[21:10.700 --> 21:13.860]  Have them trim up two or three buds and set those at your workstation so you have something
[21:13.860 --> 21:16.860]  to refer to as the day goes on so that you don't forget.
[21:17.180 --> 21:19.460]  Also, if they come by and say, hey, why are you doing it like that?
[21:19.460 --> 21:20.900]  You got a couple little buds to show them.
[21:20.900 --> 21:22.660]  You can say, hey, these are what you showed me.
[21:22.660 --> 21:23.660]  This is what I did.
[21:23.660 --> 21:24.660]  Show me the difference.
[21:24.660 --> 21:25.660]  Show me where I'm going wrong.
[21:25.660 --> 21:27.460]  Then they can say, fuck, you're doing it just like I showed you.
[21:27.460 --> 21:28.460]  I'm sorry.
[21:28.460 --> 21:29.700]  We got a nice tight trim.
[21:29.700 --> 21:31.060]  We're setting the trim in one pile.
[21:31.060 --> 21:33.260]  We're setting our little tiny buds in another pile.
[21:33.260 --> 21:35.860]  We're mixing that up so we can make good concentrates out of it.
[21:35.860 --> 21:37.580]  We're getting rid of all the sticks.
[21:37.580 --> 21:40.620]  You guys, I think we have covered most of trimming.
[21:40.620 --> 21:43.980]  One great thing about trimming is scissor and glove hash.
[21:43.980 --> 21:47.580]  All that sticky shit that builds up on your gloves and scissors is smokable.
[21:47.580 --> 21:49.580]  You can smoke that right away.
[21:49.580 --> 21:51.420]  Mike loves scissor hash.
[21:51.420 --> 21:54.620]  What I like to do if I've been trimming, so say you've been trimming, you've got this
[21:54.620 --> 21:58.620]  weird layer of sticky, gooey looking shit all over your gloves.
[21:58.620 --> 21:59.620]  That's resin.
[21:59.620 --> 22:00.620]  That's trichomes.
[22:00.620 --> 22:01.620]  That is potency.
[22:01.620 --> 22:05.020]  Rub your hands together and you'll start figuring out how to rub your hands in a circle to make
[22:05.020 --> 22:06.300]  that stuff stick together.
[22:06.300 --> 22:08.020]  A little bit of heat goes a long way.
[22:08.020 --> 22:11.820]  If your hands get warm, it'll start taking that resin right off of your hands.
[22:11.820 --> 22:13.940]  I don't want to smoke it off your skin.
[22:13.940 --> 22:18.260]  Back in the day, we used to call it finger hash, but please wear gloves now and we're
[22:18.260 --> 22:20.020]  going to call it glove hash.
[22:20.020 --> 22:21.220]  You can scrape it off your scissors.
[22:21.220 --> 22:22.820]  You can smoke it off your gloves.
[22:22.820 --> 22:23.820]  Then put it in a bowl.
[22:23.820 --> 22:27.380]  You can put it on top of some pot or just put it in an empty bowl and just put a flame
[22:27.380 --> 22:28.820]  to it and melt it.
[22:28.820 --> 22:32.420]  Just slowly melt that shit until it starts smoking and you can smoke that scissor hash,
[22:32.420 --> 22:35.260]  that glove hash, you can smoke it right away.
[22:35.260 --> 22:39.540]  But please, don't pass that shit to me if you did that off your skin and weren't wearing
[22:39.540 --> 22:40.540]  gloves.
[22:40.540 --> 22:43.300]  I don't want to smoke your skin.
[22:43.300 --> 22:46.740]  That's one good thing about trimming is you get scissor hash right away.
[22:46.740 --> 22:49.260]  I think that anything that sticks to your gloves, that's yours.
[22:49.260 --> 22:50.260]  You get to smoke that.
[22:50.260 --> 22:53.140]  If you come trim for me and that shit sticks to your gloves, I have no problem with you
[22:53.140 --> 22:56.380]  rolling that right off your glove, put that in a pipe and smoke it right in front of me.
[22:56.380 --> 22:57.380]  You earned that.
[22:57.380 --> 22:58.380]  That is your scissor hash.
[22:58.380 --> 23:00.020]  That means you're trimming your ass off.
[23:00.020 --> 23:03.900]  If it's on your scissors, scrape your scissors off, smoke that shit.
[23:03.900 --> 23:07.100]  What a lot of people will do, all the trimmers in the room will just gather all their scissor
[23:07.100 --> 23:10.020]  hash into one pile and put it into a big ball and then at the end of the day, you guys all
[23:10.020 --> 23:11.020]  smoke that together.
[23:11.020 --> 23:13.180]  It's like a little celebration.
[23:13.180 --> 23:14.260]  But it's smokeable.
[23:14.260 --> 23:15.260]  That's my point.
[23:15.260 --> 23:18.780]  You can make edibles out of it if you want to, but I would recommend smoking it.
[23:18.780 --> 23:19.940]  Mike loves smoking it.
[23:19.940 --> 23:21.100]  It's not my favorite to smoke.
[23:21.100 --> 23:25.300]  It's a little, it's heavy on the lungs and it tastes kind of wet, but it is potent and
[23:25.300 --> 23:28.380]  it will give you a big fat hit.
[23:28.380 --> 23:31.220]  Another great thing about dry trimming that I didn't mention is that when you were done
[23:31.220 --> 23:33.500]  trimming, you can now weigh your product.
[23:33.500 --> 23:35.780]  You've been cutting off the extra crap and throwing that in one pile.
[23:35.780 --> 23:38.140]  Then you've been throwing those finished buds into one pile.
[23:38.140 --> 23:40.960]  All you got to do is set that container on the scale and weigh it now.
[23:40.960 --> 23:42.980]  One thing I would recommend is a good idea.
[23:42.980 --> 23:46.020]  Whatever container you're going to throw your buds into, your finished buds, if it's
[23:46.020 --> 23:50.180]  going to be a bucket, if it's going to be a Tupperware container, weigh that and write
[23:50.180 --> 23:54.900]  the weight of that on your container so that when you're done trimming into that container,
[23:54.900 --> 23:56.420]  you know how much that weighs.
[23:56.420 --> 24:00.100]  So just subtract the weight of your container and now you know how much product is on the
[24:00.100 --> 24:01.100]  scale.
[24:01.100 --> 24:04.020]  So it's always rewarding knowing how much product you've got right at the end of the
[24:04.020 --> 24:05.020]  trim process.
[24:05.020 --> 24:08.020]  When you wet trim, you don't know because you've got to wait for it to dry still.
[24:08.020 --> 24:09.580]  So when people say, how much did you trim today?
[24:09.580 --> 24:10.820]  And they said, I trimmed a wet pound.
[24:10.820 --> 24:11.820]  How do you know, bro?
[24:11.820 --> 24:12.820]  It was wet.
[24:12.860 --> 24:14.340]  We'll find out in a few days.
[24:14.340 --> 24:18.540]  So if you're paying people to trim by the pound, dry trim is the way to go because now
[24:18.540 --> 24:20.220]  you've got dry pounds to weigh.
[24:20.220 --> 24:22.540]  You don't have a wet pound to guess on the weight.
[24:22.540 --> 24:25.980]  So here's one more thing I should definitely mention to all of my friends who have never
[24:25.980 --> 24:28.820]  trimmed before, everybody who is new with cannabis.
[24:28.820 --> 24:31.180]  Here's something that I have to tell you.
[24:31.180 --> 24:36.440]  When you are trimming or working with plants in general, do not touch your eyes with sticky
[24:36.440 --> 24:38.780]  trim fingers.
[24:38.780 --> 24:41.060]  Don't rub your eye with the back of your hand.
[24:41.060 --> 24:43.740]  Go wash your hands before you touch your eyes.
[24:43.740 --> 24:48.460]  If you rub your eyes with trichomes or plant resin on your finger, it is going to burn
[24:48.460 --> 24:51.180]  for the next hour and it is sticky.
[24:51.180 --> 24:54.620]  Every time you blink, most of the time you think you can blink and it'll fix your sticky
[24:54.620 --> 24:56.340]  eye or whatever's in your eye.
[24:56.340 --> 24:57.580]  Not when you have resin in your eye.
[24:57.580 --> 25:00.780]  Every time you blink, it gets fucking stickier and it feels like your eyelid is sticking
[25:00.780 --> 25:02.860]  to your eyeball and it just burns.
[25:02.860 --> 25:08.740]  So wear gloves and if you need to itch your eye, take your fucking glove off your hand,
[25:08.740 --> 25:09.740]  then itch your eye.
[25:09.740 --> 25:12.540]  I would almost consider washing my hands before the itch.
[25:12.540 --> 25:15.060]  Take the glove off, go wash the hand, then scratch the eye.
[25:15.060 --> 25:17.540]  But I understand sometimes you just got to stick your finger in your eye because shit's
[25:17.540 --> 25:18.540]  going weird.
[25:18.540 --> 25:19.820]  Take that glove off you guys.
[25:19.820 --> 25:23.300]  Don't put plant resin or trichomes in your eye.
[25:23.300 --> 25:25.260]  It will fucking suck.
[25:25.260 --> 25:26.340]  That's the technical term for it.
[25:26.340 --> 25:27.340]  It fucking sucks.
[25:27.340 --> 25:28.640]  There's no other way to describe it.
[25:28.640 --> 25:29.780]  It fucking sucks you guys.
[25:29.780 --> 25:30.780]  All right.
[25:30.780 --> 25:32.620]  So I feel like I've given you a pretty good lesson on trimming.
[25:32.620 --> 25:35.980]  I know I didn't teach you exactly how to trim.
[25:35.980 --> 25:39.900]  The act of holding the bud and putting the scissors to it is something you're going to
[25:39.900 --> 25:40.900]  have to experience.
[25:40.900 --> 25:43.180]  You will develop your technique and your style.
[25:43.180 --> 25:44.880]  I feel like I've given you a pretty good outline.
[25:44.880 --> 25:46.120]  You know what to do with the product.
[25:46.120 --> 25:47.420]  You know how to get it there.
[25:47.420 --> 25:49.300]  You just need some practice doing it.
[25:49.300 --> 25:51.540]  Get some buds and put some scissors to them.
[25:51.540 --> 25:53.380]  That's the only way you're going to get good at it.
[25:53.380 --> 25:55.620]  It's the only way you're going to get faster at it.
[25:55.620 --> 25:59.860]  When we hire new trimmers at The Grow, we don't always hire the people that claim to
[25:59.860 --> 26:01.000]  be the fastest trimmers.
[26:01.000 --> 26:04.020]  We hire the people that interview well and seem like they're going to fit in with the
[26:04.020 --> 26:05.020]  crew.
[26:05.060 --> 26:08.620]  If they say they can only trim a half a pound of weed when they start, that is fine if that
[26:08.620 --> 26:09.620]  is real.
[26:09.620 --> 26:12.780]  If they say they can trim a half a pound and they only do a quarter pound, then I've got
[26:12.780 --> 26:13.780]  issues.
[26:13.780 --> 26:15.700]  But they say, I can trim a half a pound in a day.
[26:15.700 --> 26:16.700]  I'm fine with that.
[26:16.700 --> 26:17.860]  We will train them.
[26:17.860 --> 26:19.100]  We will teach them our system.
[26:19.100 --> 26:20.180]  We'll teach them some tricks.
[26:20.180 --> 26:23.980]  They'll get in, they'll get a rhythm, they'll get a routine, and eventually they'll be trimming
[26:23.980 --> 26:25.660]  a pound and a half a day.
[26:25.660 --> 26:27.220]  So it's all about just finding the rhythm.
[26:27.220 --> 26:28.700]  It's all about finding the groove.
[26:28.700 --> 26:31.940]  And it takes you a little bit of time and experience to get in there and do it.
[26:31.940 --> 26:33.780]  Also, these are buds.
[26:33.780 --> 26:35.820]  These are precious to people.
[26:35.820 --> 26:37.660]  I've been in this industry for a long time.
[26:37.660 --> 26:41.500]  I can grab a flowering plant that's a few days in and just cut that fucker down and
[26:41.500 --> 26:42.900]  feel no remorse or anything.
[26:42.900 --> 26:46.300]  If that's what needed to happen in a commercial grow, I kill the plant.
[26:46.300 --> 26:49.820]  A lot of people treat little buds like they're the most precious thing they've ever seen,
[26:49.820 --> 26:50.900]  which I respect.
[26:50.900 --> 26:52.140]  You don't get to grow a bunch of plants.
[26:52.140 --> 26:55.660]  I have produced over a ton of cannabis in my life.
[26:55.660 --> 26:58.800]  I am responsible for a ton of cannabis having been produced.
[26:58.800 --> 27:01.060]  A lot of people don't have that under their belt.
[27:01.060 --> 27:03.100]  So every bud is precious to them.
[27:03.100 --> 27:05.140]  They don't want to fuck up one single bud.
[27:05.140 --> 27:06.140]  I get that.
[27:06.140 --> 27:09.580]  So when they're new at it, they go really slow, especially a hired trimmer.
[27:09.580 --> 27:10.740]  That is not their product.
[27:10.740 --> 27:12.820]  That is your bud that they're playing with.
[27:12.820 --> 27:16.620]  Respect them for taking their time and going slow with it, but also encourage them to go
[27:16.620 --> 27:17.660]  faster.
[27:17.660 --> 27:19.800]  You have to learn and go faster.
[27:19.800 --> 27:23.580]  But people like to go slow in the beginning because they're playing with gold.
[27:23.580 --> 27:25.640]  They're playing with little pieces of gold.
[27:25.640 --> 27:27.900]  They got little babies in their hand and they're new.
[27:27.900 --> 27:28.900]  So they're kind of intimidated.
[27:28.900 --> 27:30.380]  So keep that in mind.
[27:30.380 --> 27:32.620]  You'll get faster as time goes on is what I'm trying to say, you guys.
[27:33.140 --> 27:34.140]  You just need some practice.
[27:34.140 --> 27:36.380]  You'll become a good trimmer if you want to become a good trimmer.
[27:36.380 --> 27:40.460]  And if you want to get your foot in the door in the commercial marijuana industry, being
[27:40.460 --> 27:44.420]  a trimmer is probably the number one way to get in the door.
[27:44.420 --> 27:46.380]  Trimmers and bud tenders are how you get started.
[27:46.380 --> 27:51.060]  So trimming can be really time consuming and tedious, but it is the last step before you
[27:51.060 --> 27:52.940]  claim victory in your garden.
[27:52.940 --> 27:56.380]  If your garden is for sale, you're one step away from money.
[27:56.380 --> 28:02.060]  If your garden is for medicinal uses, you're one step away from feeling better.
[28:02.060 --> 28:05.300]  So trimming sucks, but you're almost there.
[28:05.300 --> 28:07.540]  It's the hardest, most time consuming, tedious part.
[28:07.540 --> 28:12.540]  In my opinion, it is my least favorite part, but it is one step away from sweet success.
[28:12.540 --> 28:13.980]  All right, podcast world.
[28:13.980 --> 28:15.860]  I hope this trimming lesson made sense.
[28:15.860 --> 28:19.620]  Again, the only way to get good at trimming is to get sticky and get some practice.
[28:19.620 --> 28:23.300]  Get in there, get your gloves dirty, get your scissors all sticky and start trimming up
[28:23.300 --> 28:24.300]  some weed.
[28:24.300 --> 28:27.820]  If you want to learn and you've got friends that are harvesting, volunteer to trim for
[28:27.820 --> 28:28.820]  free.
[28:28.820 --> 28:31.460]  Everybody could use a free trimmer and we know we're going to have to teach you.
[28:31.860 --> 28:34.580]  But we hope that in a few harvests, you're going to show up and you're going to trim
[28:34.580 --> 28:36.100]  your ass off like a savage.
[28:36.100 --> 28:39.700]  So there are people that will help you learn by letting you trim for free.
[28:39.700 --> 28:42.580]  If you get those opportunities, please do take them.
[28:42.580 --> 28:44.580]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure I left something out.
[28:44.580 --> 28:45.780]  I'm sure I missed something.
[28:45.780 --> 28:50.460]  If I sparked any questions with this episode, I invite you to email me all of your questions.
[28:50.460 --> 28:53.600]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[28:53.600 --> 28:54.900]  I would love to hear what I skipped.
[28:54.900 --> 28:56.660]  I'd love to hear what I left out.
[28:56.660 --> 29:00.260]  Or if you've got some other random questions, I will answer those also.
[29:00.260 --> 29:03.420]  Once again, it's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[29:03.420 --> 29:06.780]  Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for listening to the trimming episode.
[29:06.780 --> 29:09.300]  Here is the part where I pitch my Patreon campaign.
[29:09.300 --> 29:12.340]  I would truly appreciate your support on Patreon.
[29:12.340 --> 29:16.380]  If you feel like this podcast was worth a couple of bucks and you were able to contribute
[29:16.380 --> 29:22.020]  financially, you can do so by going to patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[29:22.020 --> 29:28.040]  That's P-A-T-R-E-O-N, patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[29:28.040 --> 29:31.480]  If you'd like to contribute to the podcast, all the information that you need will be
[29:31.480 --> 29:33.080]  right there.
[29:33.080 --> 29:36.640]  If you contribute to the podcast, I will use those contributions to pay for the website
[29:36.640 --> 29:38.840]  that keeps the podcast free for everybody.
[29:38.840 --> 29:43.160]  And I will also use those contributions to pay for the upgraded MacBook I bought so that
[29:43.160 --> 29:47.840]  I can keep the podcast coming and keep the videos coming to everybody for free.
[29:47.840 --> 29:50.200]  You guys, I will never charge you for this podcast.
[29:50.200 --> 29:54.960]  As long as I am able to put this podcast out for free, it will be free for you as well.
[29:54.960 --> 29:59.800]  I may in the future release some paid content, which will be bonus content, but this version
[29:59.800 --> 30:03.160]  of the podcast in this format always will be free.
[30:03.160 --> 30:07.000]  iTunes, Stitcher, and the YouTube channel as it is will always be free.
[30:07.000 --> 30:11.280]  I do this because I love cannabis and I love you and I want you to be able to medicate
[30:11.280 --> 30:16.640]  and recreate the best ways possible with the highest quality, cleanest, safest products
[30:16.640 --> 30:17.640]  available.
[30:17.640 --> 30:20.280]  And I think the only way you can do that is by growing it yourself.
[30:20.280 --> 30:24.800]  So I've got to teach you how to do that so that you don't have to rely on anybody else.
[30:24.800 --> 30:28.560]  So my point is that the podcast will be free, but I know there are people out there who
[30:28.560 --> 30:31.880]  would like to contribute because they emailed me and they said, Hey Jeff, how can we help
[30:31.880 --> 30:32.880]  you out?
[30:32.880 --> 30:35.160]  So Patreon is the best way to do that.
[30:35.160 --> 30:38.760]  Patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[30:38.760 --> 30:41.440]  Also I would appreciate it if you stalk me on the social media.
