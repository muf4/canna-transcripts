[00:05.950 --> 00:25.110]  All right, here we go.
[00:25.110 --> 00:26.550]  Welcome back, Podcast World.
[00:26.550 --> 00:27.550]  I'm your host.
[00:27.550 --> 00:28.870]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:28.870 --> 00:33.110]  This is episode 719 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:33.110 --> 00:35.190]  In this episode, Mike is going to join me.
[00:35.190 --> 00:37.110]  We're going to talk about our city, Pueblo.
[00:37.110 --> 00:41.230]  Before we do that part, let me do a few shout-outs to a few of the great folks who support the
[00:41.230 --> 00:43.510]  show on Patreon.
[00:43.510 --> 00:46.010]  Let's kick it off with the big Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:46.010 --> 00:49.450]  Thank you shout-out to a longtime supporter, my buddy Gramps Memo.
[00:49.450 --> 00:52.090]  Let's send a thank you shout-out to Kojax and Xavier.
[00:52.090 --> 00:55.130]  Let's send a big thank you shout-out to Grant M. and Daron T.
[00:55.130 --> 00:58.710]  Let's send a thank you shout-out to Popperoni and Blackbird76.
[00:58.710 --> 01:01.090]  Let's send a big thank you shout-out to The Painted Lady.
[01:01.090 --> 01:04.090]  Let's send a big fist bump to Growman Stan and Brian P.
[01:04.090 --> 01:07.490]  I want to send a thank you to Mr. Mean Green and the Red-Eyed Optimist.
[01:07.490 --> 01:10.330]  Then let's wrap it up with the big Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:10.330 --> 01:13.650]  Thank you shout-out to my friend, Stoner Dave.
[01:13.650 --> 01:18.330]  Big thanks and big shout-out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.

[01:27.950 --> 01:30.930]  All of the information you need is right there on the screen.
[01:30.930 --> 01:37.050]  Now with no further ado, I am super excited to welcome back to my show here in the studio
[01:37.050 --> 01:39.770]  at the table live on the brand new mic mic.
[01:39.770 --> 01:42.570]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome White Mike to the show.
[01:42.570 --> 01:45.530]  We're hearing audience clapping noises in the background right now, brother.
[01:45.530 --> 01:46.530]  Welcome to the show, dude.
[01:46.530 --> 01:47.530]  Thanks, man.
[01:47.530 --> 01:49.170]  That was a big ass intro for you, bro.
[01:49.170 --> 01:50.170]  Thank you for being here.
[01:50.170 --> 01:51.170]  Yeah, let's kill it.
[01:51.170 --> 01:52.170]  Thank you.
[01:52.170 --> 01:53.170]  It's good to be here.
[01:53.170 --> 01:56.290]  Dude, you're the first guest to appear on the show since the upgrades.
[01:56.290 --> 01:57.370]  Since the, what happened, dude?
[01:57.370 --> 01:58.370]  Why did we wait for so long?
[01:58.370 --> 02:00.010]  I feel like something was going on.
[02:00.010 --> 02:01.130]  Were you busy?
[02:01.130 --> 02:02.130]  Was I busy?
[02:02.130 --> 02:03.130]  Both.
[02:03.130 --> 02:04.330]  There was something happening that we couldn't do a show.
[02:04.330 --> 02:05.450]  I don't remember what happened.
[02:05.450 --> 02:08.810]  But anyway, for some reason, we weren't allowed to hang out for a long time and we are back,
[02:08.810 --> 02:09.850]  you guys.
[02:09.850 --> 02:11.170]  It's exciting to have Mike on the show.
[02:11.170 --> 02:14.010]  We got the two mics set up, two cameras set up.
[02:14.010 --> 02:17.370]  That almost sounded like a dirty joke waiting to happen.
[02:17.370 --> 02:18.730]  Welcome back to two dudes coughing.
[02:18.730 --> 02:19.890]  We haven't done this in a long time.
[02:19.890 --> 02:20.890]  I am excited.
[02:20.890 --> 02:23.610]  Bro, I've been just rambling my face off.
[02:23.610 --> 02:27.330]  Before we get too far, would you like to tell people how they can find you on social media?
[02:27.330 --> 02:30.170]  Because I do know that you would like some more stalkers.
[02:30.170 --> 02:35.210]  If you're looking for me on Twitter, you can find me at at Nemopunk15.
[02:35.210 --> 02:38.890]  On Facebook, it's Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[02:38.890 --> 02:41.690]  And those are the easiest two places to find me on social media.
[02:41.690 --> 02:42.690]  There you go.
[02:42.690 --> 02:43.690]  Thank you, bro.
[02:43.690 --> 02:44.690]  Also, I hope you wrote down a list.
[02:44.690 --> 02:47.490]  Do you have some Patreon shoutouts to give for the kind folks?
[02:47.490 --> 02:48.490]  Patreon shoutouts.
[02:48.490 --> 02:50.130]  I'd like to thank a couple of supporters.
[02:50.130 --> 02:52.970]  Tree Star Meadows, thank you.
[02:52.970 --> 02:54.910]  The Grokelehoman, love it.
[02:54.910 --> 02:56.770]  Thank you very much for the support.
[02:56.770 --> 02:59.250]  Thank you for the support for the podcast.
[02:59.250 --> 03:03.850]  Lemur Priest, Farmer Z, Juan Rios, thank you guys so much for supporting me.
[03:03.850 --> 03:04.850]  Those are some great folks.
[03:04.850 --> 03:05.850]  Thank you guys.
[03:05.850 --> 03:06.850]  Thanks for supporting Mike on Patreon.
[03:06.850 --> 03:07.850]  Check him out.
[03:07.850 --> 03:10.570]  Patreon.com forward slash white Mike.
[03:10.570 --> 03:13.570]  Very familiar names there.
[03:13.570 --> 03:15.450]  Thank you to the people who support both of us.
[03:15.450 --> 03:17.450]  I recognize all of those names.
[03:17.450 --> 03:18.930]  And dude, of course I'm going to send some of that.
[03:18.930 --> 03:19.930]  Sorry, we're touching knees.
[03:19.930 --> 03:21.690]  That was the awkwardest moment in the show.
[03:21.690 --> 03:22.890]  We're still learning the studio.
[03:22.890 --> 03:25.850]  We're learning the setup here, but I've got these long legs and we're both tall.
[03:25.850 --> 03:27.890]  But yeah, we're going to knee bump instead of fist bump.
[03:27.890 --> 03:28.890]  I wasn't trying to hit you or anything.
[03:28.890 --> 03:29.890]  Two giants in one studio.
[03:29.890 --> 03:30.890]  Where was I going with that?
[03:30.890 --> 03:31.890]  What the fuck was I saying?
[03:31.890 --> 03:32.890]  Oh, famous, common names.
[03:32.890 --> 03:33.890]  Common names.
[03:33.890 --> 03:35.130]  I said famous, but common names in there.
[03:35.130 --> 03:36.410]  I like that.
[03:36.410 --> 03:37.410]  That's really cool to see.
[03:37.970 --> 03:38.970]  He's real supportive.
[03:38.970 --> 03:43.410]  Of course, I'm going to send Mike a few bucks from my Patreon down his way because without
[03:43.410 --> 03:44.650]  Mike the show wouldn't exist.
[03:44.650 --> 03:48.850]  He does a lot of, when he's not on the show, he does give me a lot of supportive emails
[03:48.850 --> 03:49.850]  and behind the scenes.
[03:49.850 --> 03:51.650]  I'm like, Hey Mike, I need guidance on this show.
[03:51.650 --> 03:53.150]  And he'll always answer me and help me out.
[03:53.150 --> 03:55.010]  So even when he's not here, he's on the show.
[03:55.010 --> 03:56.250]  So thank you for the support guys.
[03:56.250 --> 03:57.850]  Got to send Mike some.
[03:57.850 --> 04:03.090]  Also thanks to all of the patrons for these, the new microphone, the mic that Mike is miking
[04:03.090 --> 04:05.490]  that is miked up, miking Mike, Mike Don today.
[04:05.490 --> 04:06.490]  It's fantastic.
[04:06.650 --> 04:07.650]  It sounds really good in my head.
[04:07.650 --> 04:10.370]  You all could hear me for the first time in two years.
[04:10.370 --> 04:12.370]  Oh yeah.
[04:12.370 --> 04:16.290]  We try to get the zooms right, but zoom is a zoom likes to fight, dude.
[04:16.290 --> 04:17.610]  I try real hard to get it correct.
[04:17.610 --> 04:20.610]  It looks good on my screen and then I put it out and I'm like, what did we just do?
[04:20.610 --> 04:24.530]  But yeah, hopefully we sound as good in your headphones as we do in ours.
[04:24.530 --> 04:25.530]  And thank you to the patrons.
[04:25.530 --> 04:29.490]  You got Mike, the microphone, the cable, the stand, the little power supply.
[04:29.490 --> 04:32.170]  You got a lot of cool stuff for Mike to be on the show.
[04:32.170 --> 04:34.250]  Got me a new fancy mic stand here.
[04:34.250 --> 04:36.050]  So thank you to the patrons that made that happen.
[04:36.610 --> 04:37.610]  That is where the funding came from.
[04:37.610 --> 04:38.610]  Big respect.
[04:38.610 --> 04:40.610]  Shout out to the patrons.
[04:40.610 --> 04:44.890]  All right, Mike, this is the part of the show where I usually save space for chatter.
[04:44.890 --> 04:46.610]  Some stuff that we could bullshit about.
[04:46.610 --> 04:47.770]  We do have a lot of notes.
[04:47.770 --> 04:51.370]  If you don't have anything to ramble about, we could jump into the main topic.
[04:51.370 --> 04:55.250]  But if you'd like to say anything, this is a good chance to open the show with some chatter.
[04:55.250 --> 04:56.850]  No major chatter right now.
[04:56.850 --> 05:00.010]  Just smashing through 2022 already.
[05:00.010 --> 05:01.010]  It's what?
[05:01.010 --> 05:02.010]  It'll be almost the end of February.
[05:02.010 --> 05:03.410]  It's the end of February.
[05:03.410 --> 05:06.770]  This will come out one week toward the end of that one week left in February when this
[05:06.770 --> 05:07.770]  comes out.
[05:07.770 --> 05:08.770]  Our birthdays are coming up.
[05:08.770 --> 05:09.770]  Spring is coming.
[05:09.770 --> 05:10.770]  Yep.
[05:10.770 --> 05:13.170]  Already it's first quarter is almost over.
[05:13.170 --> 05:16.410]  Time to start paying taxes and prep for prep for the outdoor season.
[05:16.410 --> 05:17.410]  Time goes.
[05:17.410 --> 05:20.730]  Do we feel like and sound like a couple of old guys right now talking about the weather
[05:20.730 --> 05:22.530]  and the passing of time?
[05:22.530 --> 05:23.970]  Welcome to two guys coughing.
[05:23.970 --> 05:25.530]  It is the growth from your heart podcast.
[05:25.530 --> 05:29.050]  Everybody when Mike joins me, it's you guys coughing a little bit of a ramble cast.
[05:29.050 --> 05:30.930]  Pretty solid topic, though.
[05:30.930 --> 05:32.570]  They like it when we ramble.
[05:32.730 --> 05:34.250]  Very specific and researched episode.
[05:34.250 --> 05:35.250]  We got notes.
[05:35.250 --> 05:36.250]  Mike's got a lot of notes.
[05:36.250 --> 05:37.370]  I do have an iPad full of notes.
[05:37.370 --> 05:39.970]  If I look distracted into the iPad, I'm not checking out.
[05:39.970 --> 05:42.090]  This is a very impressive studio.
[05:42.090 --> 05:45.810]  If you're looking at the video and you're like, what the fuck is Mike?
[05:45.810 --> 05:46.810]  Why does he look surprised?
[05:46.810 --> 05:48.330]  Because everything here is awesome.
[05:48.330 --> 05:49.330]  Well, thank you, brother.
[05:49.330 --> 05:52.730]  Every time my eyes adjust to something new, I see some new cool piece.
[05:52.730 --> 05:54.250]  That iPad setup is beautiful, man.
[05:54.250 --> 05:55.250]  Well, thank you, bro.
[05:55.250 --> 05:56.250]  Thank you.
[05:56.250 --> 05:57.250]  Keeps me.
[05:57.250 --> 05:58.250]  This is my focus.
[05:58.250 --> 05:59.250]  This is how I know this is my steering wheel.
[05:59.250 --> 06:00.250]  This is the drive.
[06:00.250 --> 06:01.250]  This is driving right now.
[06:01.250 --> 06:02.250]  This can all go awry.
[06:02.930 --> 06:03.930]  This sounds so good.
[06:03.930 --> 06:04.930]  Thank you, bro.
[06:04.930 --> 06:05.930]  You adjusted the lights.
[06:05.930 --> 06:06.930]  I watched you adjust to the lights.
[06:06.930 --> 06:08.410]  I didn't press record until I saw you get comfy.
[06:08.410 --> 06:09.410]  So yeah, it can be overwhelming.
[06:09.410 --> 06:10.850]  So I'm glad you're used to it already.
[06:10.850 --> 06:14.370]  The lights are a little bit strong and I can't see myself being recorded right now, which
[06:14.370 --> 06:15.570]  is a different experience.
[06:15.570 --> 06:17.450]  On Zoom, that's half of my attention focus.
[06:17.450 --> 06:18.450]  Oh, no.
[06:18.450 --> 06:19.450]  Pay attention to the show.
[06:19.450 --> 06:20.450]  You will be cool.
[06:20.450 --> 06:21.450]  All right, Mike, we're going to re-wrangle you.
[06:21.450 --> 06:22.450]  We're going to regroup you.
[06:22.450 --> 06:23.450]  I love the chatter.
[06:23.450 --> 06:28.450]  I only want to make this so long of a show and they know how we can get.
[06:28.450 --> 06:31.330]  You guys, this is, of course, episode number 719.
[06:31.410 --> 06:33.370]  Why did I want Mike here for 719?
[06:33.370 --> 06:35.490]  We live in Pueblo, Colorado.
[06:35.490 --> 06:36.490]  Mike's address is 65...
[06:36.490 --> 06:37.490]  No, I'm just kidding.
[06:37.490 --> 06:38.490]  We're in Pueblo, Colorado.
[06:38.490 --> 06:41.730]  719 is our area code.
[06:41.730 --> 06:44.450]  If you want to call Mike or I, the number is going to start in 719.
[06:44.450 --> 06:46.890]  Actually, Mike, you may have that Denver phone number still.
[06:46.890 --> 06:48.890]  I'm a 719 number.
[06:48.890 --> 06:50.770]  Most of our numbers around here are 719.
[06:50.770 --> 06:52.490]  So 719 is our area code.
[06:52.490 --> 06:57.850]  I felt it would be very appropriate to dedicate a podcast episode to our city, to our area
[06:57.850 --> 06:58.850]  code.
[06:58.850 --> 07:02.650]  If there's no one other to help me do that than our buddy, one of my best friends on
[07:02.650 --> 07:03.650]  the planet, Mike.
[07:03.650 --> 07:09.410]  Mike has been integral in the cannabis evolution, revolution, legalization, medical movement
[07:09.410 --> 07:10.410]  here.
[07:10.410 --> 07:16.610]  Also, Mike has been a big part of my development and growth as a cannabis grower.
[07:16.610 --> 07:17.770]  Whatever you want to call me.
[07:17.770 --> 07:21.250]  People call me a guru, a community leader, all those silly words that make me blush when
[07:21.250 --> 07:22.250]  you say them.
[07:22.250 --> 07:26.930]  Without Mike's contributions to the legal side, the moral side, the ethical side, and
[07:26.930 --> 07:30.410]  just his bro ship, I read genetics, the podcast wouldn't be here.
[07:30.410 --> 07:33.010]  So we had to have Mike on this show represent our city.
[07:33.010 --> 07:34.010]  Oh yeah, for sure, bro.
[07:34.010 --> 07:35.730]  I don't know if I say that enough.
[07:35.730 --> 07:39.530]  We talked about earlier, he's behind the scenes, the lawyers, the accountants, the fucking
[07:39.530 --> 07:42.890]  business guys, they all live in the tiny houses made out of ticky tacky.
[07:42.890 --> 07:45.730]  They all look just the same and they never get no fucking credit, bro.
[07:45.730 --> 07:46.890]  So damn skippy.
[07:46.890 --> 07:49.890]  I'm up here on camera with the lights in my face all the time getting all the love, getting
[07:49.890 --> 07:50.890]  all the praise.
[07:50.890 --> 07:54.810]  It's the compliment.
[07:54.810 --> 07:58.290]  We compliment each other in a way that makes all of this possible.
[07:58.290 --> 08:03.770]  Like 10 years ago, like a spark outlet and like now we're here and it's awesome.
[08:03.770 --> 08:04.770]  Yeah, I, I will.
[08:04.770 --> 08:07.570]  I've had these dreadlocks for a long time because I'm showing the camera.
[08:07.570 --> 08:10.770]  These dreadlocks are, these will be 17 years old.
[08:10.770 --> 08:13.850]  By the time this episode comes out, these dreadlocks are 17 years old, bro.
[08:13.850 --> 08:19.330]  I was uncomfortable and unprepared to go speak at city council and say, legalize cannabis.
[08:19.330 --> 08:20.410]  I felt the stigma.
[08:20.930 --> 08:22.290]  I got the expected response.
[08:22.290 --> 08:23.890]  I knew they're going to be like, yeah, white guy with dreadlocks.
[08:23.890 --> 08:25.530]  Of course you want legal weed.
[08:25.530 --> 08:29.410]  Mike was the one with the balls, the heart, the education, uh, the presentation to go
[08:29.410 --> 08:32.010]  do that for our city, our community.
[08:32.010 --> 08:36.570]  Mike influenced, shaped, uh, he, he was a big part.
[08:36.570 --> 08:41.930]  Helped write the actual rules and regs were hammering out in meetings that I somehow got
[08:41.930 --> 08:45.850]  picked to sit in the dispensaries and grows follow today.
[08:46.410 --> 08:51.210]  Home grow rules, dispensary rules, all of it got like, we invented it here.
[08:51.210 --> 08:55.810]  So, uh, Mike was coming to me and saying, Hey bro, this is the grow rule.
[08:55.810 --> 08:57.690]  They are, uh, what's it proposing?
[08:57.690 --> 08:58.770]  They want to do this.
[08:58.770 --> 08:59.770]  How do you feel?
[08:59.770 --> 09:00.850]  What is the good and bad of that?
[09:00.850 --> 09:04.010]  And I would say, oh, that would ruin this because of this.
[09:04.010 --> 09:07.250]  Or a lot of times they would try to say that each plant's going to harvest seven pounds
[09:07.250 --> 09:10.970]  and take 30 gallons of water a day and you can pull seven of them a week.
[09:10.970 --> 09:12.290]  And Mike would say, give me the real numbers.
[09:12.290 --> 09:15.610]  And I would give him like square footage per light, how many grams I would expect.
[09:16.370 --> 09:19.650]  To the people that were actually making the rules and say, I know a grower, this is what
[09:19.650 --> 09:20.770]  he really does.
[09:20.770 --> 09:24.050]  And so Mike was, I wasn't going to go there and say, I grow weed.
[09:24.050 --> 09:24.890]  This is how it goes.
[09:24.890 --> 09:26.330]  Mike was the, uh, the liaison.
[09:26.330 --> 09:27.050]  Is that the word?
[09:27.050 --> 09:31.810]  Uh, the representative, if you will, uh, for me and for, for the industry here, for the
[09:31.810 --> 09:32.410]  community here.
[09:32.410 --> 09:36.210]  So that's why, uh, without Mike, this industry here wouldn't be what it is.
[09:36.210 --> 09:37.730]  And that's, I'm not just tooting his horn.
[09:38.050 --> 09:39.570]  Uh, he, he's a pioneer.
[09:39.570 --> 09:40.210]  He was here.
[09:40.490 --> 09:41.090]  Uh, yeah.
[09:41.090 --> 09:41.330]  It's good to hear.
[09:41.330 --> 09:44.050]  Cause it was a lot of work.
[09:44.730 --> 09:44.890]  Yeah.
[09:44.890 --> 09:48.370]  And to see where, where we are now because of that work is awesome.
[09:48.970 --> 09:53.650]  Like it was fun research in the show and looking at, um, some of the numbers, uh,
[09:53.690 --> 09:57.170]  where we started and where we are now is just, it's beautiful, man.
[09:57.810 --> 10:01.570]  Uh, we went from a small, we just, we are good examples.
[10:01.650 --> 10:04.050]  We, I don't like to, we're doing okay.
[10:04.090 --> 10:04.970]  That's the best way I can say it.
[10:04.970 --> 10:07.930]  We used to kind of not be as financially okay.
[10:07.930 --> 10:10.770]  As we are today, we used to just straight not be okay.
[10:11.010 --> 10:14.130]  And anyway, everybody else in what?
[10:14.370 --> 10:17.450]  20, 2010, 2011, 2012.
[10:17.450 --> 10:20.250]  How many different economic crashes did we go through in that short
[10:20.250 --> 10:20.570]  of a time?
[10:20.570 --> 10:20.810]  Yeah.
[10:21.170 --> 10:21.450]  Yep.
[10:21.690 --> 10:25.290]  Um, the cars used to suck and break down all the time.
[10:25.330 --> 10:27.570]  Dude, I had that white van that the doors didn't lock.
[10:27.650 --> 10:29.650]  They'd come open when he'd turn it would run out of gas.
[10:29.650 --> 10:30.890]  Cause the gas gauge didn't work.
[10:32.290 --> 10:33.250]  You'd have to walk sometimes.
[10:33.250 --> 10:34.850]  The engine was just dying.
[10:34.890 --> 10:36.010]  Make me shit my pants.
[10:36.050 --> 10:36.490]  Oops.
[10:36.530 --> 10:37.450]  Ran out of gas, dude.
[10:37.450 --> 10:38.170]  Why didn't you get gas?
[10:38.170 --> 10:39.330]  Oh, the gas gauge doesn't work.
[10:39.330 --> 10:39.690]  Yeah.
[10:39.690 --> 10:41.130]  Those, that used to be how our life is.
[10:41.130 --> 10:42.490]  And now I know my car will start.
[10:42.490 --> 10:44.130]  We built it up slow.
[10:44.130 --> 10:48.970]  And a lot of that was, we carved out a place for ourself and in the legal
[10:48.970 --> 10:51.330]  cannabis world, a big part of it, bro.
[10:51.330 --> 10:54.610]  Create the legal cannabis world to carve ourselves a piece out of
[10:54.610 --> 10:54.890]  there.
[10:54.890 --> 10:56.570]  And we didn't fuck anybody over.
[10:56.650 --> 10:56.970]  Yep.
[10:57.170 --> 10:58.410]  That's a huge part of it.
[10:58.450 --> 11:03.250]  We took a couple of individual fuck-ins and a group fucking, uh, but we
[11:03.250 --> 11:04.410]  didn't fuck anybody over.
[11:04.410 --> 11:07.290]  Probably we still have the opportunity, but we're not going to do it.
[11:07.330 --> 11:10.490]  Still have the opportunity, but we're not going to, there's plenty of, yeah.
[11:10.730 --> 11:11.730]  Just why do business that way?
[11:11.770 --> 11:11.930]  Yeah.
[11:11.930 --> 11:14.290]  That's part of why, why, why I think we got where we did.
[11:14.290 --> 11:18.290]  Cause we didn't fuck the people that needed it or that could have, you know,
[11:18.290 --> 11:22.170]  we just took it in stride and laughed and walked away and told other people I
[11:22.170 --> 11:22.810]  wouldn't fuck with them.
[11:22.810 --> 11:24.890]  Cause they, they, they bent us over pretty good.
[11:25.450 --> 11:26.650]  Uh, but yeah.
[11:26.650 --> 11:31.090]  So, uh, Mike, let's focus in a little bit because, uh, we did go from, we, we
[11:31.090 --> 11:32.810]  were not doing financially well.
[11:32.810 --> 11:34.850]  Like I remember your house on eighth street, dude.
[11:35.170 --> 11:35.570]  Oh yeah.
[11:35.690 --> 11:41.170]  And, uh, yeah, there was a minute where we were living with in-laws and there
[11:41.170 --> 11:46.250]  were like five adults in this tiny little three room spot for a minute while we got
[11:46.250 --> 11:47.610]  everybody back on their feet.
[11:47.610 --> 11:47.850]  And.
[11:48.770 --> 11:52.370]  Um, that was back before there was a legal cannabis market.
[11:52.410 --> 11:52.770]  Right.
[11:53.050 --> 11:55.930]  Um, that was back when I was walking to city council meetings.
[11:55.930 --> 11:56.970]  Cause I didn't have a car.
[11:57.290 --> 12:00.610]  Cause we were a one car household and my wife had a better job.
[12:00.610 --> 12:01.250]  So she got the car.
[12:02.010 --> 12:04.530]  Um, and I walked cause it was, I wasn't getting paid.
[12:04.530 --> 12:07.650]  I was just going to city council because somebody needed to go to city council.
[12:08.410 --> 12:14.570]  Um, and I could, I, uh, I talk about it sometimes on Patreon and other places
[12:15.890 --> 12:17.930]  for a couple of different reasons.
[12:18.090 --> 12:23.250]  Uh, if you went and spoke about cannabis, uh, you had to have nothing to lose
[12:23.250 --> 12:25.330]  cause you were risking kind of everything doing it.
[12:26.010 --> 12:31.530]  And some of that started to change when I was going, I was risking a lot, but I
[12:31.570 --> 12:35.210]  wasn't risking like what Cheech and Chong were risking being them back then.
[12:36.170 --> 12:36.890]  And.
[12:37.970 --> 12:42.890]  Uh, after a while, it sort of like a little protective thing formed because all of the
[12:42.890 --> 12:47.570]  police knew me and they knew that I was active in city council and that if they
[12:47.570 --> 12:51.650]  came and, and tried to raid my house or something that would make the paper.
[12:51.650 --> 12:53.570]  And so that everything would have to be perfect.
[12:53.570 --> 12:55.210]  So they just never bothered to try.
[12:56.090 --> 12:58.370]  Um, and I never gave them a reason to try.
[12:58.370 --> 12:59.770]  I had to be very, very careful.
[13:00.370 --> 13:04.650]  But because I was careful and because everything worked the way it did, this
[13:04.650 --> 13:05.890]  whole city's different now.
[13:05.890 --> 13:09.370]  And that's sort of what the episode's about is where the city started and where it is
[13:09.370 --> 13:09.770]  now.
[13:09.930 --> 13:11.210]  Yeah, that's completely good.
[13:11.210 --> 13:11.850]  Segway brother.
[13:11.890 --> 13:13.170]  Um, you like the Segway?
[13:13.370 --> 13:14.370]  We're called to bring it in.
[13:14.410 --> 13:15.050]  You got it, dude.
[13:15.050 --> 13:16.810]  I was quiet and patient letting you do it.
[13:16.810 --> 13:17.530]  I knew it was coming.
[13:17.610 --> 13:20.090]  Uh, we were called Pueblo is called the steel city.
[13:20.130 --> 13:21.290]  Uh, we have a steel mill here.
[13:21.290 --> 13:22.490]  That's what forged our city.
[13:22.490 --> 13:27.010]  A long time ago, we had the opportunity to either get, uh, the university or the steel
[13:27.010 --> 13:27.410]  mill.
[13:27.610 --> 13:29.730]  And instead of a university, we chose a steel mill.
[13:29.730 --> 13:33.130]  And so, uh, that is kind of the mentality that has been here for a long time.
[13:33.130 --> 13:34.930]  No offense to the people that forged our city.
[13:34.930 --> 13:41.010]  It exists because of you, but, uh, it was very, it was like 60 some thousand jobs at
[13:41.010 --> 13:41.650]  one point.
[13:41.770 --> 13:46.210]  And by the time I moved to Pueblo, it was like 5,000.
[13:46.930 --> 13:51.010]  So just, I mean, the city was hurting bad.
[13:51.010 --> 13:52.450]  It was, it was dusty.
[13:52.450 --> 13:52.970]  It was dirty.
[13:52.970 --> 13:53.490]  It was broke.
[13:53.490 --> 13:54.490]  There was nowhere to eat.
[13:54.810 --> 13:58.410]  Uh, it's still a little funky, but it's getting a lot better now.
[13:58.730 --> 14:00.250]  Uh, it used to be just all labor jobs.
[14:00.250 --> 14:04.410]  If you were our age, well, not our age now, but if you were in the mid twenties,
[14:04.410 --> 14:07.810]  30, you were doing construction or fast food or crime.
[14:08.090 --> 14:09.930]  A lot of people legit straight up here.
[14:10.610 --> 14:14.010]  We're doing petty crimes just enough to get away just to survive.
[14:14.010 --> 14:17.010]  And there's not enough law enforcement here to make that dangerous.
[14:17.010 --> 14:19.090]  You could do that here and make a small living doing that.
[14:19.090 --> 14:20.130]  Don't come here and try to do that.
[14:20.130 --> 14:21.610]  But that's how you used to live here.
[14:21.730 --> 14:24.770]  Now, all those people that were living by petty crime, restaurants,
[14:24.970 --> 14:28.970]  struggling, unemployment, uh, just doing whatever kind of hustles.
[14:29.130 --> 14:31.690]  A lot of them got legit jobs in the cannabis industry.
[14:31.690 --> 14:34.810]  A lot of people were illegal growers, illegal dealers, illegal, whatever's
[14:34.810 --> 14:38.890]  now they are actually in the legal industry, paying taxes with the badge.
[14:39.170 --> 14:42.850]  Being contributing members to society, not having to hide, not being in fear.
[14:43.170 --> 14:45.690]  Uh, now that's one less person for law enforcement to look out for.
[14:45.690 --> 14:46.810]  So we've come a long way.
[14:47.410 --> 14:49.730]  We've got restaurants here, bro.
[14:50.530 --> 14:52.570]  Watching the city transform has been fun.
[14:52.610 --> 14:53.090]  Isn't it?
[14:53.210 --> 14:57.970]  It, uh, the whole place used to shut down at like seven 30 at night.
[14:57.970 --> 15:01.210]  It used to drive me batty because I'm from Denver.
[15:01.210 --> 15:02.730]  I grew up, grew up in Denver.
[15:02.730 --> 15:05.810]  I did my early twenties and mid twenties in Denver.
[15:06.410 --> 15:10.490]  And I liked that you can get a variety of delicious food at two in the morning
[15:11.010 --> 15:13.730]  and to move to Pueblo and have that not be an option sucked.
[15:13.810 --> 15:14.090]  Yeah.
[15:14.410 --> 15:16.210]  I'm from California, so I feel it.
[15:16.210 --> 15:19.890]  Where after seven 30 at night is jack in the box or something you cook.
[15:19.890 --> 15:21.010]  That's just miserable.
[15:21.730 --> 15:28.570]  And slowly but surely over the years, Pueblo's gotten like 5% better a year.
[15:29.210 --> 15:29.530]  Right.
[15:29.530 --> 15:31.210]  And it's, it's a lot better now.
[15:31.210 --> 15:33.250]  We've got stuff I'd never thought I'd see here.
[15:33.610 --> 15:36.610]  But I'm, I've got a special diet needs.
[15:36.610 --> 15:37.330]  I, it's my fault.
[15:37.330 --> 15:39.010]  You guys, I'm, I'm like, try to eat.
[15:39.250 --> 15:41.490]  You guys don't care, but now there are restaurants I can eat at.
[15:41.530 --> 15:44.690]  Like a lot of times it'd be like, you can get a burger, but now I'm vegetarian.
[15:44.690 --> 15:45.570]  I don't want to eat a burger.
[15:45.890 --> 15:47.410]  How many grilled cheese can you get?
[15:47.410 --> 15:48.050]  Yeah, exactly.
[15:48.370 --> 15:52.210]  There are plenty of marvelous, wonderful vegetarian restaurants around here where
[15:52.210 --> 15:55.730]  I can walk in and, or not specifically vegetarian, but places that offer
[15:55.770 --> 15:59.650]  specifically vegetarian menus and items and meals, and it's got the V on it or
[15:59.650 --> 16:02.490]  the little vegetable next to it to let me know, Hey bro, you can eat this here.
[16:02.890 --> 16:04.530]  A few years ago, that wasn't an option.
[16:04.530 --> 16:08.890]  You could get Mexican food or a burger and, or a burger with green chili on it.
[16:08.890 --> 16:10.170]  That was also an option here.
[16:10.290 --> 16:10.530]  Yup.
[16:10.610 --> 16:10.930]  Yeah.
[16:11.250 --> 16:11.810]  Awesome.
[16:12.530 --> 16:18.890]  I mean, even our mall is dying slower than the rest of them because, uh, legal
[16:18.890 --> 16:22.490]  cannabis, our city council and our less so.
[16:23.050 --> 16:27.330]  Um, but the County commissioners saw the opening that that, that would give
[16:27.330 --> 16:29.850]  economically and they dove on it hard.
[16:30.610 --> 16:35.730]  And, uh, we're still, I think it was fifth or sixth largest producing
[16:35.730 --> 16:38.930]  County in the state, um, tax revenue wise.
[16:39.890 --> 16:42.290]  Pueblo is doing really well right now because of this.
[16:42.850 --> 16:46.050]  And people do like to talk a lot of trash about us, but we're growing, we're
[16:46.050 --> 16:48.050]  expanding, it's getting weird reputation.
[16:48.090 --> 16:49.930]  Well, there are parts of, there are parts of town.
[16:49.930 --> 16:51.610]  I will not wear my watch too.
[16:51.610 --> 16:52.530]  That is for damn sure.
[16:52.530 --> 16:56.530]  But there's parts of that part of town where you don't wear the drip.
[16:56.650 --> 16:56.930]  Yeah.
[16:56.930 --> 16:59.530]  You take the watch off and he hide the sneakers and you just
[16:59.530 --> 17:00.650]  don't get out the fucking car.
[17:00.650 --> 17:02.450]  But that's, there's that part in every city.
[17:02.450 --> 17:04.010]  It's just, you gotta be careful where you go.
[17:04.370 --> 17:07.050]  Uh, but it's getting better and we're getting a lot more stores.
[17:08.010 --> 17:10.010]  Uh, there's a sneaker shop here now.
[17:10.330 --> 17:13.250]  I was shocked when you were like, this is a really good sneaker shop in Pueblo.
[17:13.250 --> 17:13.450]  Yeah.
[17:13.450 --> 17:17.690]  They sell like high end hoodies and high end sneakers and like fashion stuff,
[17:17.690 --> 17:19.690]  like luxury fashion items that are not.
[17:19.930 --> 17:21.810]  Super affordable for the average shopper.
[17:21.810 --> 17:25.850]  But since we've got a nice thriving economy here, a lot of the people that
[17:25.850 --> 17:28.130]  shop there honestly are in the cannabis industry.
[17:28.130 --> 17:29.050]  I recognize them.
[17:29.050 --> 17:30.090]  We see each other when we're there.
[17:30.090 --> 17:30.770]  It's like, what's up, bro?
[17:30.770 --> 17:31.890]  You run that run grow.
[17:32.170 --> 17:34.490]  Like we, we all smell like dank when we go in there.
[17:34.650 --> 17:36.850]  Like, and that's because of this industry, we wouldn't have no
[17:36.850 --> 17:38.930]  drip to drip if we weren't working at the grows.
[17:39.410 --> 17:43.570]  Uh, it's, uh, the impact it had in Pueblo.
[17:43.570 --> 17:46.530]  We've got one of the higher unemployment rates in town and this sort
[17:46.530 --> 17:47.850]  of what Jeff was talking about.
[17:48.490 --> 17:55.330]  It, it added jobs at exactly the right moment and it added, um, building
[17:55.330 --> 18:00.170]  investment and real estate investment to just the right moments and
[18:00.210 --> 18:02.690]  really revitalize the whole County.
[18:03.090 --> 18:05.570]  I mean, it's not like a lot of winning.
[18:05.570 --> 18:07.770]  It didn't change everything overnight.
[18:07.770 --> 18:09.170]  Our streets aren't paved in gold.
[18:09.170 --> 18:15.890]  Most of them still are full of potholes, but little things got better and it gets
[18:15.890 --> 18:20.170]  a little bit better every year because the whole industry gets a little bit
[18:20.170 --> 18:23.490]  bigger every year, so like the first year.
[18:23.810 --> 18:28.530]  We paved a couple of sidewalks near some middle schools and bought some golf
[18:28.570 --> 18:36.130]  carts for a golf course that a lot of senior citizens in this area use.
[18:36.130 --> 18:39.770]  So it was sort of like a senior citizen tax funded thing.
[18:40.210 --> 18:41.010]  I wasn't real happy.
[18:41.010 --> 18:42.770]  They were spending money on golf carts, but whatever.
[18:43.170 --> 18:44.130]  It's an old grudge.
[18:44.650 --> 18:48.210]  And then, you know, three years later, we're not doing sidewalks in front of
[18:48.210 --> 18:54.330]  schools, we're doing a gymnasium on a school and then a $5,000 in scholarships
[18:54.330 --> 18:59.170]  becomes 15 and then 20 and now it's at like 2 million a year, I think.
[18:59.210 --> 19:02.930]  2 million and 2 million a year in scholarships going into Pueblo County.
[19:03.810 --> 19:04.210]  Good job.
[19:04.210 --> 19:04.810]  Pueblo County.
[19:04.810 --> 19:09.210]  Anybody can apply if they meet some really basic criteria.
[19:09.730 --> 19:16.210]  And, uh, I mean, it doesn't sound like a ton of money per student, but like
[19:16.210 --> 19:19.930]  $2,500 a year can be the difference between going and not going.
[19:20.010 --> 19:20.450]  Oh yeah.
[19:20.570 --> 19:22.130]  They can pay for your books, right?
[19:22.210 --> 19:22.410]  Yeah.
[19:22.410 --> 19:25.490]  It turns out that it is for a lot of people, especially because the
[19:25.530 --> 19:29.490]  universities down here in Pueblo don't charge what some of the major
[19:29.490 --> 19:33.410]  universities elsewhere do, but they, they give you a good education and this
[19:33.410 --> 19:36.850]  lets a lot of kids locally go to college that might not otherwise.
[19:37.010 --> 19:38.570]  It's opportunity that wasn't there.
[19:38.570 --> 19:39.610]  So yeah, that's great, man.
[19:39.610 --> 19:40.050]  That's great.
[19:40.530 --> 19:42.410]  That's good to know that we're putting that much money back into
[19:42.410 --> 19:43.850]  education here through cannabis.
[19:44.010 --> 19:45.810]  And that's just Pueblo County.
[19:45.810 --> 19:48.890]  That's from a local tax initiative.
[19:49.370 --> 19:52.650]  That's not some of the state taxes that we'll talk about a little bit later.
[19:53.010 --> 19:55.370]  That's just from a local County tax that they do.
[19:55.370 --> 19:57.530]  It all goes into one education fund.
[19:58.090 --> 20:03.050]  Um, someone we know from the cannabis industry that used to work at the retail
[20:03.050 --> 20:06.170]  level now works in that education fund.
[20:06.530 --> 20:07.290]  That's so great.
[20:07.490 --> 20:12.570]  It's, it just provided that employment stepping stone and that little bit of
[20:12.570 --> 20:16.130]  extra lifeblood that our city needed to get back on its feet.
[20:16.970 --> 20:19.970]  So many of our people here were unemployed and lost and now they've all got really
[20:19.970 --> 20:21.530]  cool jobs because of this industry.
[20:22.090 --> 20:23.370]  I've met so many cool people.
[20:23.370 --> 20:25.450]  That's the next thing on my list is the people, bro.
[20:25.450 --> 20:31.610]  The quality of the people has changed here in town and it's a more, uh, it's
[20:31.610 --> 20:35.450]  just a more enlightened, more open-minded, maybe a younger sort of a vibe.
[20:35.890 --> 20:41.410]  Um, when I moved here, the biggest issue that the city council was talking about
[20:41.410 --> 20:46.010]  was how do we get, um, not senior citizens to move here?
[20:46.490 --> 20:51.410]  Because it was sort of a retirement community because we just didn't have a
[20:51.410 --> 20:56.650]  lot of jobs for your average, like 20 to 50 year old.
[20:57.170 --> 21:03.090]  We had a couple of call centers and a couple of other small time, you know, 50
[21:03.090 --> 21:05.530]  job, a hundred job production facilities.
[21:05.530 --> 21:10.450]  And then the mill had like five or 6,000 employees and that was sort of it.
[21:11.250 --> 21:16.450]  And little by little this industry slowly grew.
[21:16.450 --> 21:21.330]  Like we watched it back in the medical only days before the rec wave of funding
[21:21.330 --> 21:24.490]  and money really hit all of the grow shops.
[21:24.530 --> 21:27.970]  First, there was two hydroponic shops in town and they both sucked.
[21:28.570 --> 21:31.330]  And then they both got a lot better because there was a lot
[21:31.330 --> 21:32.490]  more money going through them.
[21:33.210 --> 21:39.410]  And now there's like 15, there's three or four on each side and they all suck.
[21:39.450 --> 21:45.330]  But, um, but most of them are thriving because growing at home, a couple of
[21:45.330 --> 21:49.970]  plants is something that a lot of people do and they all need all the supplies for
[21:49.970 --> 21:50.290]  that.
[21:50.330 --> 21:56.930]  And, um, just the different ways that legalization is impacted.
[21:56.930 --> 21:58.570]  The city are kind of ridiculous.
[21:58.570 --> 22:01.050]  The longer you think about it, the more impacts you see.
[22:01.570 --> 22:01.890]  Right.
[22:01.930 --> 22:09.370]  Um, and then when the rec wave hit, it was 50% of our construction funding for
[22:09.730 --> 22:10.570]  on my list.
[22:10.650 --> 22:12.810]  That's one of the things on my list is construction.
[22:12.890 --> 22:15.370]  I think it was 2013.
[22:16.130 --> 22:18.450]  It was like 52 million.
[22:18.850 --> 22:23.370]  Um, and I know these because in 2015 the anti-pop people tried to throw the
[22:23.370 --> 22:26.530]  industry out of town and I had a lot of other people do the data digging for me.
[22:27.170 --> 22:28.730]  And I just remember the numbers from then.
[22:29.370 --> 22:33.530]  But, uh, uh, we had 1300 employees back then.
[22:33.530 --> 22:35.130]  It's about 2,500 now.
[22:36.010 --> 22:43.130]  Um, there's 30 or 40 different businesses down here that employ thousands of people
[22:43.770 --> 22:44.850]  across the state.
[22:44.850 --> 22:47.490]  There's like 40,000 employees across the state.
[22:47.490 --> 22:48.250]  40,000.
[22:48.330 --> 22:48.650]  All right.
[22:48.650 --> 22:50.050]  I can give you exact numbers.
[22:50.050 --> 22:51.010]  I wrote those down.
[22:51.410 --> 22:52.570]  So this is fun.
[22:52.610 --> 22:59.610]  Before the pandemic, we had 40,267 individuals licensed to work in legal
[22:59.610 --> 23:00.330]  cannabis.
[23:00.610 --> 23:02.250]  You have to have an employment badge.
[23:02.250 --> 23:04.330]  So we know exactly how many of those are active.
[23:04.370 --> 23:04.730]  Okay.
[23:05.090 --> 23:13.690]  And there were 1,686 businesses currently, uh, two years into it, we've got 41,783.
[23:14.250 --> 23:21.850]  Uh, so a thousand, 1500 more badged people and 1,887 businesses.
[23:21.850 --> 23:24.730]  So 200 businesses opened during the pandemic.
[23:25.290 --> 23:25.850]  All right.
[23:26.130 --> 23:27.490]  Things weren't as bad as we might've thought.
[23:27.890 --> 23:29.210]  Not for the cannabis industry.
[23:29.210 --> 23:33.290]  It's, I guess I wouldn't call it recession proof, but it's recession proof, just like
[23:33.290 --> 23:34.930]  all the other mild vice industries.
[23:35.010 --> 23:36.970]  When you're stuck at home and can't see people, what?
[23:37.090 --> 23:38.810]  You'd smoke some weed and hang out on Zoom.
[23:39.050 --> 23:39.370]  Yeah.
[23:39.410 --> 23:40.930]  Sales have gone up every year.
[23:40.930 --> 23:44.690]  Colorado's had the industry, not substantially, but they do.
[23:45.410 --> 23:51.290]  Um, if you're curious, it works out to about 355 bucks per person in the
[23:51.290 --> 23:51.850]  states.
[23:51.890 --> 23:53.730]  I started to do the math and gave up.
[23:53.810 --> 23:54.770]  I was like, I'm good.
[23:54.930 --> 24:03.970]  So, uh, the way you can do the math, um, is you just take the yearly sales and
[24:03.970 --> 24:09.410]  divide it by 575 or 5,759,000 people in Colorado.
[24:10.290 --> 24:12.730]  Um, I think I fucked this math up actually.
[24:13.530 --> 24:14.810]  Somebody out there will correct you.
[24:14.850 --> 24:21.130]  If I remember right, I might've done the total tax hall divided by the people in
[24:21.170 --> 24:26.290]  the state would be $355 per person in the state so far after like seven years,
[24:26.930 --> 24:27.930]  which is a weird way.
[24:28.010 --> 24:29.210]  That's not a helpful number.
[24:29.970 --> 24:30.930]  Still a fun number to have.
[24:30.930 --> 24:32.650]  That's why you don't get dabbed while you do your research folks.
[24:32.690 --> 24:34.450]  Hey, you didn't have a lot of time to prepare Mike.
[24:34.450 --> 24:35.810]  So I'm glad that you're, that you made it.
[24:35.810 --> 24:37.210]  Guys, shout out to Mike for making it here.
[24:37.410 --> 24:39.050]  But there was some scrambling today.
[24:39.450 --> 24:42.130]  So I'm going to go fast because we're already, I wrote down here, Mike, if you
[24:42.130 --> 24:44.730]  see me making check marks, this is 30, 45 and 60.
[24:44.730 --> 24:47.250]  That's how many minutes we've been going just to politely let you know where we
[24:47.250 --> 24:47.530]  are.
[24:47.690 --> 24:48.930]  We're almost at this point.
[24:49.290 --> 24:51.010]  Um, so you've covered this.
[24:51.010 --> 24:54.050]  I just wanted to say, uh, there are a lot of cool ancillary businesses that did
[24:54.050 --> 24:57.610]  open head shops, restaurants, sneaker shops, clothing places.
[24:57.610 --> 24:58.570]  The mall is staying alive.
[24:58.570 --> 24:59.170]  Just like you said,
[24:59.170 --> 25:06.090]  The ripple effect is intense because like there's the, the grows, the transport
[25:06.090 --> 25:12.570]  people, the retail outlets, and then there's the hash makers or the processors,
[25:12.570 --> 25:16.010]  the edible companies, all of those people need packaging.
[25:16.010 --> 25:17.650]  All of those people need labeling.
[25:17.650 --> 25:19.570]  All of those people need light bulbs.
[25:20.250 --> 25:24.010]  All of those people need plumbers and electricians and bankers and lawyers.
[25:24.650 --> 25:26.010]  And business executives.
[25:26.570 --> 25:26.930]  Yeah.
[25:26.970 --> 25:28.570]  All of those people need lunch.
[25:28.930 --> 25:31.970]  Um, you know, all of those people need tires on their cars.
[25:32.010 --> 25:32.410]  Dude.
[25:32.570 --> 25:35.970]  How about, so there's a small subdivision, uh, West of us.
[25:35.970 --> 25:39.370]  Ironically, it's called Pueblo West out there in Pueblo West.
[25:39.370 --> 25:43.850]  There are, there are a lot of grows and a several dispensaries out there.
[25:44.210 --> 25:45.490]  Uh, there was nothing to eat out there.
[25:45.490 --> 25:48.410]  There are a few, there's like a Thai restaurant and some other shit.
[25:48.450 --> 25:49.970]  There's a Thai food place in a Wendy's.
[25:50.090 --> 25:50.370]  Yeah.
[25:50.690 --> 25:51.450]  He's really right.
[25:51.690 --> 25:54.610]  Unless you've got all day, then you can go to Sonic, but that who wants to do that?
[25:54.610 --> 25:55.890]  Shout out to not eating Sonic.
[25:56.290 --> 26:00.650]  Uh, eventually a bunch of food trucks popped up out there and it, from like 11
[26:00.650 --> 26:04.770]  to about two o'clock, it looked like a food truck fair and they were banking
[26:04.770 --> 26:07.850]  money cause you'd see the whole trim crew out there just lined up and they'd all be.
[26:08.130 --> 26:09.450]  And they'd come back and hold their gun.
[26:09.450 --> 26:11.610]  Be like, bro, that barbecue place is fired tomorrow.
[26:11.610 --> 26:12.930]  We're going to the chicken wing place.
[26:12.930 --> 26:16.170]  And the next day we're having falafel and like those barbecue trucks and
[26:16.370 --> 26:17.890]  food trucks were killing it out there.
[26:17.890 --> 26:21.850]  So that was a whole nother business just because of the business that was out there.
[26:22.130 --> 26:22.730]  It's.
[26:23.370 --> 26:25.090]  It's been fun watching it grow.
[26:25.090 --> 26:30.290]  And when it started, there was that whole area was just empty warehouses.
[26:30.450 --> 26:30.770]  Yeah.
[26:31.010 --> 26:36.130]  And now it's all thriving businesses with five, 10, 15 employees.
[26:36.130 --> 26:36.370]  Each.
[26:36.370 --> 26:37.650]  All those people need lunch.
[26:38.370 --> 26:41.850]  All the security guards, the gas stations are busy.
[26:42.090 --> 26:44.770]  Try to go at lunch and get like something from the gas station.
[26:44.770 --> 26:45.650]  And you got to wait in line.
[26:45.650 --> 26:47.010]  And all the trim crews out there.
[26:47.050 --> 26:47.410]  Yeah.
[26:47.650 --> 26:49.330]  The traffic out in that area is nuts.
[26:49.330 --> 26:51.930]  And it used to be empty because there were no jobs out there.
[26:51.930 --> 26:55.410]  So the only traffic was at night with people coming back into town.
[26:56.170 --> 26:57.930]  And now it's swamp all day.
[26:57.930 --> 26:59.610]  Cause there's just a ton of people out there.
[26:59.810 --> 27:04.010]  Do you know the average age of the people working in the cannabis industry?
[27:04.330 --> 27:04.810]  No.
[27:04.890 --> 27:05.290]  Okay.
[27:05.410 --> 27:09.970]  I just wondered if you had that because I would assume it's mostly like 24 to like
[27:10.170 --> 27:14.290]  35 and then you're going to have a few, you know, there's going to be some, some
[27:14.290 --> 27:16.690]  outliers, but then you're going to have like management and stuff is going to be
[27:16.690 --> 27:18.330]  like 40 to 50 year olds.
[27:18.530 --> 27:21.330]  This is sort of researchable information.
[27:21.370 --> 27:23.170]  The state of Colorado.
[27:23.210 --> 27:27.570]  One of the things we did right from the get go was trying to collect data.
[27:28.090 --> 27:31.770]  And so you can go on the Colorado department of revenue website and just
[27:31.770 --> 27:32.730]  Google is your friend.
[27:33.250 --> 27:35.210]  Just ask Google questions you want to know.
[27:35.290 --> 27:40.290]  And it'll, it was real easy to find the number of people that have badges, the
[27:40.290 --> 27:41.890]  number of business licenses.
[27:42.330 --> 27:44.970]  You can look up who got fined last year.
[27:44.970 --> 27:46.370]  They make that real easy to find.
[27:46.370 --> 27:48.490]  You can look up taxes by county.
[27:49.010 --> 27:54.610]  They've even got a real, uh, a tab that makes graphs for you and you can do pie
[27:54.610 --> 27:56.570]  charts or bar charts and look at tax.
[27:56.610 --> 27:57.450]  Oh, that's too fun.
[27:57.450 --> 27:59.850]  That's why I know that Pueblo was like the sixth.
[27:59.890 --> 28:03.770]  I didn't have time to sit there and add up all the numbers.
[28:04.610 --> 28:08.290]  Uh, cause you asked me if I could figure out the percentage of marijuana grown in
[28:08.290 --> 28:09.810]  Colorado that comes from Pueblo.
[28:09.930 --> 28:10.530]  Yeah.
[28:10.770 --> 28:15.210]  And technically I know how to do that and I know where to get the info, but it's
[28:15.370 --> 28:20.530]  hours and hours and hours with the work until I find a way to make it easier.
[28:20.890 --> 28:24.690]  And I'm sure smarter people already know that way, but with the data that's
[28:24.690 --> 28:32.130]  available to me, I would have had to go for two January 1st, 2014 and just write
[28:32.130 --> 28:38.930]  down, um, how much Pueblo paid in taxes and hit plus and go forward a month at a
[28:38.930 --> 28:44.130]  time to the present day and then just do the math cause the, the totals are there.
[28:44.570 --> 28:45.730]  But it's easy to find.
[28:46.090 --> 28:48.850]  Uh, somebody, somebody get on it, start typing.
[28:48.890 --> 28:53.130]  I want to know what percentage of the legal cannabis produced in Colorado is
[28:53.130 --> 28:55.610]  produced in Pueblo if it's recreational or medical.
[28:55.970 --> 28:58.250]  So there's a hundred percent of cannabis produced in Colorado.
[28:58.250 --> 29:01.690]  What percentage is made here in Pueblo County, a city or
[29:01.690 --> 29:03.930]  County, uh, recreational or medical.
[29:04.250 --> 29:05.730]  One of my data is the number.
[29:05.730 --> 29:07.410]  Guys, let's break it down.
[29:07.570 --> 29:07.850]  Okay.
[29:07.850 --> 29:11.650]  Cause it's broken down by County and no one outside of Pueblo County understands
[29:11.690 --> 29:15.130]  that the city of Pueblo and the city, the County of Pueblo are different entities.
[29:15.450 --> 29:15.810]  Yeah.
[29:15.970 --> 29:19.010]  Um, I tried to explain that to city government and they got kind of pissy
[29:19.010 --> 29:19.450]  about it.
[29:20.210 --> 29:25.050]  Um, but, uh, this, you can figure it out by County.
[29:25.090 --> 29:32.410]  We're only 160,000 people down here and the state of Colorado is 5.75 million.
[29:32.890 --> 29:35.690]  So 160,000 is not that many people.
[29:35.690 --> 29:37.170]  Our city's not that big.
[29:37.730 --> 29:41.090]  And we were the fifth, fourth, fifth or sixth.
[29:41.090 --> 29:43.370]  I think it's the fifth largest producer in the state.
[29:43.770 --> 29:49.650]  So we're supplying all kinds of area around town, around the state that, uh,
[29:50.570 --> 29:52.890]  either can't grow their own or can't grow enough of their own.
[29:53.650 --> 29:53.850]  Yeah.
[29:53.850 --> 29:56.290]  Everybody says, go down to Pueblo and get some herbs down there.
[29:56.330 --> 29:59.490]  So it's a whole commercial market knows you're going to stop down here and get
[29:59.490 --> 30:01.130]  some pounds for a while.
[30:01.130 --> 30:03.210]  If you're in the commercial market, you guys don't think you're just driving
[30:03.210 --> 30:03.770]  here to get pounds.
[30:03.770 --> 30:08.770]  That's not, it's not, we might still be the only County in Pueblo where it's
[30:08.770 --> 30:10.650]  legal for a business to grow outdoors.
[30:11.650 --> 30:13.770]  Um, I know that was true for awhile.
[30:13.770 --> 30:17.050]  I haven't been super on top of other counties, law changes for the last
[30:17.050 --> 30:17.490]  little bit.
[30:17.890 --> 30:20.770]  So somebody might've squeaked that one in there, but I think we're still the
[30:20.770 --> 30:24.450]  only County where that's legal in Colorado, which is sort of insane when you
[30:24.450 --> 30:29.170]  think about it, but the other counties are dumb and Pueblo week reaps the
[30:29.170 --> 30:29.930]  windfall.
[30:30.170 --> 30:35.730]  Um, unfortunately for awhile, uh, the anti-pop people in the powers that be
[30:35.730 --> 30:37.810]  have a moratorium on new businesses.
[30:38.450 --> 30:43.930]  So we're sort of capped at where we are right now, but, um, for a long time, it
[30:43.930 --> 30:44.930]  was a boom here.
[30:45.010 --> 30:49.330]  And if you don't have legal pot in your area, by all means, use this podcast to
[30:49.330 --> 30:51.290]  help argue for legal pot in your area.
[30:51.330 --> 30:51.610]  Yeah.
[30:51.650 --> 30:53.170]  Pay off a lot of the debts in your town.
[30:53.170 --> 30:56.730]  Fix the roads, fund some schools, get some kids, some scholarships.
[30:57.210 --> 30:59.130]  Uh, the moratorium here doesn't bother me.
[30:59.490 --> 31:03.690]  Um, there is plenty of cannabis available, plenty of cannabis businesses.
[31:03.690 --> 31:04.690]  It's, it's fine.
[31:04.690 --> 31:05.570]  We don't need more.
[31:05.850 --> 31:06.770]  Uh, it's okay.
[31:08.050 --> 31:13.930]  Um, for now it, uh, when it goes legal nationally, it, it'll hurt us right now.
[31:13.930 --> 31:18.170]  It might be helping, but, uh, the rest of the planet needs our herb.
[31:18.770 --> 31:21.970]  And I love that we need to expand enough to provide that
[31:22.010 --> 31:23.570]  grove enough for the whole planet.
[31:23.810 --> 31:26.890]  Um, or just get everybody out there at home to grow their own.
[31:26.890 --> 31:28.650]  You guys exercise your legal rights.
[31:28.890 --> 31:31.890]  I can't tell you to break the law, but you're an adult, but if you are in a
[31:31.890 --> 31:35.650]  legal place where it is legal and safe for you to produce any amount of cannabis,
[31:35.810 --> 31:37.770]  grow your legal fucking limits.
[31:37.770 --> 31:38.930]  Grow that as much as you can.
[31:38.930 --> 31:42.250]  If they say you can have six plants, grow six Volkswagen buses.
[31:42.610 --> 31:44.010]  Uh, it's almost outdoor season.
[31:44.250 --> 31:46.970]  Grow them big, grow them loud, proud, grow them strong.
[31:47.250 --> 31:48.690]  If it's illegal where you are.
[31:48.930 --> 31:50.770]  Uh, I legally can't tell you to break the law.
[31:50.770 --> 31:54.330]  I also can't tell you Mike, Michael, Mike, he's calling white Mike for a reason, but
[31:54.450 --> 31:56.650]  here I am saying you're a fucking adult.
[31:56.690 --> 31:58.930]  Keep your mouth shut and do what the fuck you think is right.
[31:59.010 --> 32:00.210]  Also have a lawyer on retainer.
[32:00.490 --> 32:04.050]  Um, girlfriends and homies ruin ruin grows.
[32:04.090 --> 32:05.490]  We have definitely talked about that.
[32:05.490 --> 32:07.330]  Don't tell anybody, keep your mouth shut.
[32:07.730 --> 32:09.650]  Uh, the electrician doesn't need to see it.
[32:09.930 --> 32:13.290]  Don't tip the delivery driver or the Uber driver, the grub hub dude with
[32:13.290 --> 32:15.410]  we don't pay people with weed.
[32:15.450 --> 32:17.890]  Just, yeah, they don't need to know where the, that you got weed.
[32:18.050 --> 32:20.410]  Like they know you got it, but they don't even know that you got enough to gift at
[32:20.410 --> 32:20.610]  them.
[32:20.610 --> 32:21.850]  Then they're going to wonder where it came from.
[32:22.250 --> 32:23.330]  They're going to come back to your house.
[32:23.370 --> 32:24.570]  They may show up when you're not there.
[32:24.930 --> 32:26.650]  Um, that episode just took a turn.
[32:26.930 --> 32:30.690]  Um, bro, we provide a lot of ganja here in the seven one nine.
[32:30.930 --> 32:33.850]  We have worked with a lot of growth facilities and a lot of people here.
[32:34.050 --> 32:34.890]  What's fun.
[32:34.970 --> 32:40.010]  Like when, when I was working in grow facilities, I purposely never did the math
[32:40.010 --> 32:44.770]  in my head, but since I don't anymore, I went back and do the math in my head and
[32:44.770 --> 32:45.530]  I just chuckle.
[32:46.290 --> 32:54.050]  Um, especially when I do the math and I pretend like it's the year 2000, uh, when
[32:54.050 --> 32:56.290]  it was 400 an ounce was just the friend price.
[32:56.330 --> 32:56.650]  Yeah.
[32:57.330 --> 33:01.490]  Um, letting you know, letting you shop here was, was the friend discount.
[33:02.050 --> 33:02.450]  Yeah.
[33:02.970 --> 33:05.650]  Um, we've made businesses.
[33:05.970 --> 33:07.410]  Multi money.
[33:07.450 --> 33:07.930]  May.
[33:07.930 --> 33:08.210]  Yeah.
[33:08.250 --> 33:08.490]  Yeah.
[33:08.530 --> 33:10.970]  Rivers, literally of money rivers and rivers.
[33:10.970 --> 33:14.690]  And we got paid small streams of the analogy I used to get the city to finally
[33:14.690 --> 33:15.610]  allow businesses.
[33:15.610 --> 33:18.770]  It was, I kept telling them there's a river of money flowing right around the
[33:18.770 --> 33:22.890]  city because the County was dove in with both fees when this started.
[33:22.970 --> 33:23.450]  Oh yeah.
[33:23.650 --> 33:25.930]  There were a couple of city tiptoed in back in the day.
[33:25.930 --> 33:29.810]  I had to drive either 15 that way or 15 that way to get out of city limits, to be
[33:29.850 --> 33:31.450]  able to go buy medical cannabis.
[33:31.450 --> 33:36.610]  And then, um, we, bro, we put one right in the middle of the heart of downtown.
[33:36.850 --> 33:40.010]  Big shout out to Tom and Karen for trusting us and having faith in us to run that
[33:40.010 --> 33:40.570]  business.
[33:40.810 --> 33:44.250]  Uh, one day I told Tom, I forget the words that I used.
[33:44.250 --> 33:46.210]  I basically told him he didn't really know how to run a business.
[33:46.210 --> 33:48.610]  I think I said it more politely than that because I did respect him.
[33:49.290 --> 33:53.330]  And he reached across the counter and he gave me keys and he said, do it then.
[33:53.450 --> 33:55.650]  And I was like, Oh shit, I've been talking shit.
[33:55.650 --> 33:56.570]  And now it's time to shine.
[33:56.570 --> 33:57.130]  And guess what?
[33:57.450 --> 33:59.450]  Mike and I shown like some stars.
[33:59.450 --> 34:01.370]  So, uh, big shout out to Tom and Karen.
[34:02.130 --> 34:04.530]  Yeah, we've been, we have, we've been a good team since then, bro.
[34:04.530 --> 34:06.450]  We've been going for a 37 minutes.
[34:06.810 --> 34:08.570]  Do you have anything that you'd like to add to this show?
[34:08.570 --> 34:11.090]  Because honestly, we've gone through most of the notes that I've got.
[34:11.090 --> 34:13.410]  There's no reason to backtrack on the things I've got here.
[34:13.810 --> 34:21.890]  Um, um, just, uh, not to put a damper on it, but to put some perspective on it.
[34:22.450 --> 34:27.930]  Um, Colorado state's total budget is like 30 to 40 billion a year.
[34:28.730 --> 34:34.770]  So far to date, our total cannabis tax hall just broke 2 billion, which is a huge record.
[34:35.090 --> 34:39.330]  That's $2 billion with the awesome stuff we couldn't have done before that we got
[34:39.330 --> 34:46.530]  to do now because of this, but it's like half a percent or 1% maybe of a year, a
[34:46.530 --> 34:47.810]  state's yearly budget.
[34:48.410 --> 34:53.690]  So like, it's not, it's really not a lotto ticket, but it's a hundred percent a
[34:53.690 --> 34:54.290]  lifeline.
[34:54.850 --> 34:57.770]  And for our city, a hundred percent, it saved us.
[34:58.130 --> 35:02.690]  Like I can't even imagine what Pueblo would be like now if this wouldn't happen.
[35:02.770 --> 35:03.610]  I wouldn't be here.
[35:03.810 --> 35:08.450]  Um, it got us national press.
[35:09.050 --> 35:14.770]  It brought in a lot of people moved here that were like in their twenties and
[35:14.770 --> 35:15.290]  thirties.
[35:15.970 --> 35:22.090]  Um, the boom for the construction industry was hit so hard back then.
[35:22.730 --> 35:27.770]  And the way that this really revitalized Pueblo has been awesome and getting to
[35:27.770 --> 35:29.930]  see it all firsthand has been a lot of fun.
[35:30.570 --> 35:32.090]  Um, see it, bro.
[35:32.090 --> 35:33.010]  You've shaped it.
[35:33.090 --> 35:33.450]  Yeah.
[35:33.810 --> 35:35.930]  Um, that's so funny.
[35:35.930 --> 35:40.330]  I read those homegrown meetings were really, really, really, really funny.
[35:41.050 --> 35:47.850]  Um, so if you're still listening, fun story, uh, this is the best part.
[35:47.850 --> 35:49.250]  You guys, these are the gems.
[35:49.250 --> 35:53.650]  I'm in a, I'm in a city meeting that I was, I was randomly approached after a city
[35:53.650 --> 35:56.770]  council meeting to attend a meeting about a specific rule.
[35:57.650 --> 36:00.930]  And other people, um, officially were invited.
[36:00.930 --> 36:03.250]  They didn't know how to make the rule and how to craft it.
[36:03.890 --> 36:08.690]  And so I show up to this meeting and I'm early and excited.
[36:08.930 --> 36:12.850]  Um, cause I'm being included finally, and I'm not kicking and screaming at a wall
[36:12.850 --> 36:14.570]  is what it felt like for a lot of the work.
[36:15.330 --> 36:21.250]  And we start talking and the two people sitting next to me are narcotics detectives
[36:21.650 --> 36:26.730]  who are talking about shooting a video that I a hundred percent apparent
[36:26.810 --> 36:28.530]  at least a couple of times.
[36:29.770 --> 36:33.890]  It, I just have the biggest smile on my face.
[36:33.890 --> 36:35.850]  And finally, one of them goes, what?
[36:36.330 --> 36:39.530]  And I go, I used to go up and down those stairs a lot.
[36:40.170 --> 36:44.050]  And they just both didn't have any idea what to say to that.
[36:44.050 --> 36:47.010]  They just kind of looked at each other and looked at me and look back at each
[36:47.010 --> 36:48.890]  other and I just started laughing.
[36:49.770 --> 36:53.210]  Um, and it was a lot of fun cause at the end of that meeting, they took my
[36:53.210 --> 36:56.210]  suggestion and my suggestion is still the rule for the city.
[36:56.810 --> 36:59.930]  So yeah, I win.
[37:00.610 --> 37:02.690]  Story time with Mike and he won in the end.
[37:02.690 --> 37:04.130]  So that's a good victory for Mike.
[37:04.610 --> 37:05.970]  Uh, man, those stairs.
[37:05.970 --> 37:07.610]  I remember, I know the stairs you're talking about.
[37:07.610 --> 37:09.050]  That was a good time.
[37:09.490 --> 37:14.650]  Uh, there was a lot of, uh, loading of plants, uh, loading of product in and out.
[37:14.650 --> 37:16.010]  That was a good time, dude.
[37:16.250 --> 37:17.490]  I wonder what kind of footage they got.
[37:17.650 --> 37:18.770]  I'd like to see that footage.
[37:19.130 --> 37:19.410]  Yeah.
[37:19.450 --> 37:22.010]  The, the, uh, there was apparently a camera watching the
[37:22.010 --> 37:23.970]  backstairs for the last several weeks.
[37:24.290 --> 37:25.410]  That is scary.
[37:25.770 --> 37:26.050]  Yep.
[37:27.050 --> 37:27.850]  That place is gone.
[37:27.930 --> 37:30.450]  Um, we paid them a lot of tax money and then they decided
[37:30.450 --> 37:31.410]  to come in and shut us down.
[37:31.690 --> 37:35.570]  Uh, Mike and I, we had some friends that were founding a dispensary and
[37:35.570 --> 37:36.650]  they didn't quite know what to do.
[37:36.650 --> 37:38.250]  They had, they had a really good idea.
[37:38.250 --> 37:39.370]  That's the best way to say it.
[37:39.370 --> 37:39.490]  Yeah.
[37:39.490 --> 37:42.090]  They needed some young blood in there and I was young and eager and I went in
[37:42.090 --> 37:44.930]  there and I was like, let's do this and this, and we got them going as a dispensary.
[37:45.250 --> 37:45.970]  I couldn't handle it.
[37:45.970 --> 37:47.130]  So I hired Mike in there.
[37:47.490 --> 37:50.170]  Um, and then we took that place the fuck off, dude.
[37:50.370 --> 37:54.170]  A moment ago, you were talking about, uh, people that came here for cannabis, dude.
[37:54.170 --> 37:57.130]  I wanted to give a shout out to, uh, I'm not going to say names.
[37:57.130 --> 37:58.730]  You guys know who you are, bro.
[37:58.730 --> 38:03.090]  We met and made so many friends that we would have never met you and I do.
[38:03.250 --> 38:05.850]  So many, like we met because of a dispensary.
[38:05.890 --> 38:07.410]  You're crazy.
[38:07.410 --> 38:08.770]  You're a fucker of a father-in-law.
[38:08.770 --> 38:09.890]  Shout out you crazy fucker.
[38:10.130 --> 38:13.690]  Uh, he brought Mike in there to make friends with me and we, we fucking hit it off, dude.
[38:13.690 --> 38:15.250]  We became great friends immediately.
[38:15.650 --> 38:19.130]  Uh, the, we've got plenty of friends that we don't even need to run the gamut of
[38:19.130 --> 38:23.090]  friends cause somebody will feel left out, but we made so many friends, guys,
[38:23.090 --> 38:27.290]  girls, different ages, sexes, genders, locations that are all here that we made
[38:27.290 --> 38:29.610]  friends with, uh, through the cannabis industry.
[38:29.610 --> 38:30.650]  So I'm grateful for you guys.

[38:31.570 --> 38:33.370]  Even if we don't talk, it's been a long time.
[38:33.530 --> 38:35.570]  If you're still here, moved on.
[38:36.010 --> 38:36.530]  Yeah.
[38:36.530 --> 38:37.770]  Thank you for being part of the journey.
[38:37.810 --> 38:38.090]  Yep.

[38:44.410 --> 38:45.010]  pandy is over.
[38:45.010 --> 38:46.290]  If you lived through it, I forgive you.
[38:46.290 --> 38:46.770]  How's that?
[38:47.290 --> 38:47.610]  Yeah.
[38:47.730 --> 38:49.210]  If you lived through the pandemic, we ain't got no beef.
[38:49.210 --> 38:50.250]  No, I'm on super fair.
[38:50.330 --> 38:50.610]  Yeah.
[38:50.770 --> 38:51.570]  Super fair.
[38:51.610 --> 38:52.610]  We're survivors together.
[38:52.610 --> 38:53.370]  So let's do that.
[38:53.850 --> 38:55.330]  Um, bro, I'm through my notes.
[38:55.330 --> 38:56.290]  I'm rambling at this point.
[38:56.290 --> 38:59.490]  They like it when we ramble, but that, uh, really like it when we ramble, but
[38:59.490 --> 39:01.370]  we're, we've, we're limited by our battery.
[39:03.010 --> 39:04.010]  Card time there.
[39:04.010 --> 39:04.490]  Yeah.
[39:04.690 --> 39:05.250]  Yep.
[39:05.490 --> 39:06.370]  Pretty sure we could still go.
[39:06.370 --> 39:07.130]  Technology.
[39:08.450 --> 39:09.130]  Um, bro.
[39:09.130 --> 39:09.970]  Great podcast.
[39:09.970 --> 39:12.250]  It's great having you back on the studio.
[39:12.250 --> 39:14.050]  It's amazing, bro.
[39:14.570 --> 39:14.970]  Thank you.
[39:15.010 --> 39:18.130]  Uh, we got four walls to three walls to choose from for backgrounds.
[39:20.050 --> 39:25.450]  All the way to this, from your iPhone with a little headphone, Mike, this is just
[39:25.450 --> 39:26.250]  amazing.
[39:26.290 --> 39:26.770]  Thank you, dude.
[39:26.770 --> 39:27.850]  It's, it's come a long way.
[39:27.850 --> 39:28.930]  I'm glad that you're noticing it.
[39:28.930 --> 39:30.610]  So it's seven, one, nine in the can.
[39:30.610 --> 39:31.250]  This was beautiful.
[39:31.250 --> 39:31.410]  Yeah.
[39:31.410 --> 39:31.970]  Seven, one, nine.
[39:31.970 --> 39:32.650]  Mike will be back.
[39:32.650 --> 39:34.970]  You guys, now that he knows that there's a mic over there waiting for him.
[39:34.970 --> 39:37.330]  I mean, we know, I know, I know that we can record group shows.
[39:37.690 --> 39:38.490]  Uh, Michael, we back.
[39:38.490 --> 39:39.730]  This is so much better than zoom.
[39:39.730 --> 39:43.330]  I'm frustrated recording zoom shows the whole like, Hey bro, what are we going to
[39:43.370 --> 39:43.730]  say?
[39:45.290 --> 39:46.210]  Oh, it's my turn to talk.
[39:47.530 --> 39:48.210]  Uh, go ahead.
[39:48.210 --> 39:48.730]  But here you go.
[39:48.730 --> 39:49.250]  Wait, what?
[39:49.450 --> 39:50.290]  You're you're muted.
[39:50.290 --> 39:51.410]  This is so pleasant.
[39:52.010 --> 39:58.410]  And I, I, if you, if I sound half as good in your headphones as I do in mine,
[39:58.810 --> 40:00.370]  Oh, the listeners no more.
[40:00.690 --> 40:01.970]  You can finally hear me again.
[40:02.090 --> 40:03.210]  I'm so happy about this.
[40:03.250 --> 40:04.050]  Don't jinx us buddy.
[40:04.290 --> 40:06.370]  I've worked so hard to be audible.
[40:06.610 --> 40:07.450]  I'm sorry.
[40:07.970 --> 40:08.330]  Yeah.
[40:08.330 --> 40:12.490]  That like once again, zoom has, uh, bent us over occasionally cave does not work
[40:12.490 --> 40:12.970]  very well.
[40:12.970 --> 40:14.050]  You're invited back, bro.
[40:14.050 --> 40:15.970]  Anytime that you can get off the leash, anytime you can.
[40:16.010 --> 40:20.690]  Uh, I asked him, I asked Mike if it was morally wrong or legally wrong to kennel
[40:20.690 --> 40:21.250]  the children.
[40:21.250 --> 40:23.450]  And he didn't seem to find that appropriate.
[40:23.450 --> 40:23.930]  You guys.
[40:24.010 --> 40:25.210]  So Mike's a good person.
[40:28.050 --> 40:29.250]  I might be a piece of shit.
[40:29.250 --> 40:30.010]  Mike's a good person.
[40:30.010 --> 40:32.930]  Every day they get older, getting away from them gets a little easier.
[40:32.930 --> 40:34.890]  If you've got kids, you understand that sentiment.
[40:35.050 --> 40:35.250]  Yeah.
[40:35.250 --> 40:36.130]  Um, yeah.
[40:36.170 --> 40:39.010]  But, uh, for a minute it was tough for a couple of different reasons.
[40:39.690 --> 40:46.490]  Um, part of it is just the routine doesn't let up and finding gaps is, is
[40:46.490 --> 40:48.010]  getting easier right now.
[40:48.090 --> 40:50.170]  So hopefully there's a lot more of these.
[40:50.170 --> 40:52.090]  This studio is too awesome to stay away.
[40:52.730 --> 40:53.770]  I'm really blown away, bro.
[40:53.770 --> 40:54.490]  This is awesome.
[40:54.530 --> 40:55.690]  Keep saying studio, brother.
[40:55.770 --> 40:57.250]  They'll forget that it's my dining room.
[40:57.250 --> 40:57.930]  So I appreciate it.
[40:57.930 --> 40:58.210]  Thank you.
[40:58.210 --> 40:58.850]  It's a studio.
[40:58.850 --> 41:01.010]  You haven't eaten food here in three years.
[41:01.010 --> 41:01.330]  Very true.
[41:01.330 --> 41:01.810]  Studio.
[41:01.850 --> 41:02.290]  It's very true.
[41:02.290 --> 41:04.410]  This is, yeah, there's no food allowed at this table.
[41:04.410 --> 41:05.570]  It used to be a kitchenette.
[41:05.850 --> 41:06.130]  Yep.
[41:06.210 --> 41:08.330]  This is where we, uh, used to eat dinner here, but thank you, bro.
[41:08.330 --> 41:08.970]  I appreciate it.
[41:09.490 --> 41:11.490]  Um, man, I've had something else.
[41:11.490 --> 41:12.050]  I was going to ramble.
[41:12.050 --> 41:12.890]  It must not have been too boring.
[41:12.890 --> 41:14.730]  It's about the kids coming over.
[41:14.770 --> 41:15.930]  Um, come over, bro.

[41:20.970 --> 41:22.010]  I totally forgot what I was going to say.
