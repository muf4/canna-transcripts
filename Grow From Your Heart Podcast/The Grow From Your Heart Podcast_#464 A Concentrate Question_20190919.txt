[00:00.000 --> 00:04.560]  Hey, what's up ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, chicks and bros,
[00:04.560 --> 00:07.040]  smokers and growers, friends and foes.
[00:07.040 --> 00:11.520]  Welcome to Episode 465 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:11.520 --> 00:15.620]  This episode of the show is brought to you by my friends at Seeds Here Now.
[00:15.620 --> 00:20.680]  If you need new regular, feminized or auto flower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend
[00:20.680 --> 00:28.640]  Seeds Here Now and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:28.640 --> 00:32.320]  You know I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:32.320 --> 00:36.820]  This evening, I am taking dabs of India Pale from our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[00:36.820 --> 00:40.400]  This is a full spectrum extract, which means it is saucy and has chunks of diamonds and
[00:40.400 --> 00:42.160]  crystals in it.
[00:42.160 --> 00:45.880]  The cross is a blend of ruby red and peel your face.
[00:45.880 --> 00:50.640]  On the package, they describe the flavor as hops, fuel, and grapefruit rind.
[00:50.640 --> 00:52.640]  I honestly did not get any hops.
[00:52.640 --> 00:56.840]  I am not a fan of hops, so it is just fine that I do not catch the hops aroma.
[00:56.840 --> 00:58.720]  I do get a hint of fuel.
[00:58.720 --> 01:03.400]  The grapefruit rind is there, but honestly, this tastes more to me like strawberries and
[01:03.400 --> 01:05.000]  hints of watermelon.
[01:05.000 --> 01:07.320]  I really enjoy that fruity flavor.
[01:07.320 --> 01:09.720]  It's a big switch from what I normally go for.
[01:09.720 --> 01:13.880]  When it comes to concentrates, lately I've been buying the more savory flavors, so it
[01:13.880 --> 01:18.960]  was a nice change of pace, a nice change of aroma and flavor, and definitely a different
[01:18.960 --> 01:19.960]  buzz.
[01:19.960 --> 01:25.300]  This went straight to my head, made me forgetful, made me kind of have a hard time paying attention.
[01:25.300 --> 01:29.180]  The potency label says 68% THC.
[01:29.180 --> 01:32.180]  Something about this concentrate makes it hard to focus.
[01:32.180 --> 01:37.220]  Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious India Pale Ale Full
[01:37.220 --> 01:38.420]  Spectrum Extract.
[01:38.420 --> 01:41.600]  I highly recommend this concentrate.
[01:41.600 --> 01:43.780]  This is going to be a quick Thursday episode.
[01:43.780 --> 01:46.140]  I do have a couple of questions from some friends.
[01:46.140 --> 01:51.100]  Before we get there, let's do some shout outs to our friends on Patreon.
[01:51.100 --> 01:54.700]  I'd like to send a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and a thank you to our friend
[01:55.100 --> 01:56.100]  Willie's armpit.
[01:56.100 --> 01:58.460]  I owe a giant thank you to our friend Mike F.
[01:58.460 --> 02:03.100]  As always, a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and a thank you to David OQ.
[02:03.100 --> 02:05.180]  Also another giant shout out to Mike H.
[02:05.180 --> 02:08.820]  I also want to send a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out thank you and a fist
[02:08.820 --> 02:10.740]  bump to our friend Farmer John.
[02:10.740 --> 02:15.700]  And last but certainly not least, I want to send a big thank you and a fist bump to our
[02:15.700 --> 02:18.460]  friend Darren W.
[02:18.460 --> 02:22.140]  Big thank you and big shout out to all of the people who have been supporting the show
[02:22.140 --> 02:24.320]  through the Patreon campaign.
[02:24.440 --> 02:31.320]  If you would like to learn how to support the show, you can do so by visiting www.patreon.com

[02:39.240 --> 02:40.380]  All right, podcast world.
[02:40.380 --> 02:45.240]  At the start of the show, I did say I was going to answer listener-generated questions,
[02:45.240 --> 02:47.040]  so let's jump right into that.
[02:47.040 --> 02:51.940]  A very good question I received lately was, at the start of the show, you always tell
[02:51.940 --> 02:53.320]  us what you're smoking.
[02:53.320 --> 02:56.460]  That is always apothecary or green dot products.
[02:56.460 --> 03:01.060]  Why aren't you smoking concentrates made from your own garden?
[03:01.060 --> 03:02.780]  That is a very good question.
[03:02.780 --> 03:05.800]  My first answer is I am not a concentrate maker.
[03:05.800 --> 03:07.480]  I do not make concentrates.
[03:07.480 --> 03:10.820]  I am a cannabis grower and a cannabis breeder.
[03:10.820 --> 03:16.060]  I probably have a lot of other titles, cannabis advocate, cannabis activist, cannabis photographer.
[03:16.060 --> 03:19.540]  There's a lot of other things that I could probably be labeled as, but I am a grower.
[03:19.540 --> 03:20.540]  I am a breeder.
[03:20.880 --> 03:24.960]  The things I find the most passion for, followed by photography.
[03:24.960 --> 03:26.160]  That is where my heart lies.
[03:26.160 --> 03:29.600]  I do not find much interest in making concentrates.
[03:29.600 --> 03:30.600]  I have done it.
[03:30.600 --> 03:31.600]  I know how to do it.
[03:31.600 --> 03:33.720]  I understand the process.
[03:33.720 --> 03:36.880]  Concentrate making is just not where my passion lies.
[03:36.880 --> 03:38.800]  We've got great friends like Spence.
[03:38.800 --> 03:40.400]  We've got great friends like Kev.
[03:40.400 --> 03:44.720]  We've got all the people that work at Apothecary, all of the people that work at Green Dot,
[03:44.720 --> 03:49.960]  all of the wonderful, highly trained, highly skilled concentrate makers across the country.
[03:49.980 --> 03:52.580]  I am letting them do that work for me.
[03:52.580 --> 03:54.260]  It is a dangerous process.
[03:54.260 --> 03:57.940]  It can be a dangerous process making concentrates.
[03:57.940 --> 04:02.900]  The concentrates I enjoy, the concentrates I prefer are made with butane.
[04:02.900 --> 04:07.580]  If you are not familiar with the butane extraction process, it sounds like it can be very dangerous.
[04:07.580 --> 04:09.260]  Yes, you are correct.
[04:09.260 --> 04:11.020]  It can be very dangerous.
[04:11.020 --> 04:16.700]  We are working with a very flammable hydrocarbon and any small mistake could result in an explosion.
[04:16.720 --> 04:21.160]  I am leaving the concentrate making up to the people with the proper labs, the proper
[04:21.160 --> 04:23.680]  equipment and the proper training.
[04:23.680 --> 04:29.400]  When it comes to acquiring safe, reliable quality concentrates, I tend to shop at some
[04:29.400 --> 04:30.840]  of my favorite dispensaries.
[04:30.840 --> 04:32.480]  I always mention Apothecary.
[04:32.480 --> 04:34.600]  I like the Apothecary concentrates.
[04:34.600 --> 04:35.600]  They're a great concentrate.
[04:35.600 --> 04:38.520]  They have a great price point and they're great folks.
[04:38.520 --> 04:41.440]  I also really enjoy Green Dot Labs.
[04:41.440 --> 04:43.200]  They make great products.
[04:43.200 --> 04:47.980]  They are a little higher in price point compared to some concentrate companies, but you get
[04:47.980 --> 04:49.300]  what you pay for.
[04:49.300 --> 04:50.300]  I like their concentrates.
[04:50.300 --> 04:52.100]  I like the full spectrum extracts.
[04:52.100 --> 04:55.020]  I like the batters and I like their cartridges.
[04:55.020 --> 04:59.860]  So Apothecary Farms and Green Dot Labs are probably my two favorites.
[04:59.860 --> 05:03.780]  There are several companies competing for third place.
[05:03.780 --> 05:09.780]  Unfortunately, I live in a smaller market, so the availability isn't as broad for myself
[05:09.780 --> 05:11.860]  as some folks in other markets.
[05:11.920 --> 05:14.840]  If you're in Denver or Boulder, you've got many more options.
[05:14.840 --> 05:16.160]  I'm down here in Pueblo.
[05:16.160 --> 05:18.560]  I've only got a few stores to choose from.
[05:18.560 --> 05:19.560]  That is not true.
[05:19.560 --> 05:21.680]  I've got a lot of stores to choose from.
[05:21.680 --> 05:26.000]  Many of them are a waste of time, so I've narrowed it down to two or three stores.
[05:26.000 --> 05:31.040]  Most of those stores, their top shelf product is either an Apothecary extract or a Green
[05:31.040 --> 05:32.520]  Dot Labs concentrate.
[05:32.520 --> 05:35.520]  So that is why I buy my concentrates from the dispensary.
[05:35.520 --> 05:38.000]  Now why am I not buying my own strains?
[05:38.000 --> 05:41.680]  Because in Colorado, we have got some ridiculous rules.
[05:41.700 --> 05:48.420]  Anything sold in a Colorado dispensary must be grown and produced in a Colorado Marijuana
[05:48.420 --> 05:51.460]  Enforcement Division regulated facility.
[05:51.460 --> 05:53.460]  All of that makes sense.
[05:53.460 --> 05:59.280]  We have a program called seed to sale tracking and it is exactly what it sounds like.
[05:59.280 --> 06:03.820]  From the inception of a seed, from the planting and germination of that seed, all the way
[06:03.820 --> 06:08.380]  through growth, all the way through harvest, all the way through trimming, then whatever
[06:08.480 --> 06:13.080]  type of processing is done to that flower, if it is turned into an extract, if it is
[06:13.080 --> 06:18.280]  turned into an edible, if it is thrown away at this point, it is tracked all the way to
[06:18.280 --> 06:21.360]  the point of retail at the consumer level.
[06:21.360 --> 06:25.880]  So it will be tracked from the flower, from the plant to the flower, dried and cured.
[06:25.880 --> 06:30.740]  Then once it is sent to an extraction facility or an edible maker, it is tracked.
[06:30.740 --> 06:32.080]  Then they process it.
[06:32.080 --> 06:33.080]  Then it is tracked.
[06:33.080 --> 06:37.400]  That batch number of your flower now becomes the batch number of that edible or that concentrate.
[06:37.420 --> 06:39.380]  That number is now attached to that.
[06:39.380 --> 06:43.020]  So if there is a problem in the future with your edible or with your concentrate, we can
[06:43.020 --> 06:45.340]  trace back which flower batch that came from.
[06:45.340 --> 06:48.680]  We can tell which grow that came from or the opposite.
[06:48.680 --> 06:53.540]  If we detect a problem in the flower or in the concentrate, because every flower is lab
[06:53.540 --> 06:58.660]  tested and every batch of concentrate is lab tested, if a problem is detected, we are able
[06:58.660 --> 07:03.180]  to recall the products that were made from that by following that batch number down the
[07:03.180 --> 07:04.180]  line.
[07:04.180 --> 07:06.740]  So there is a seed to sale tracking system.
[07:07.500 --> 07:12.580]  There was a time period where we were allowed to bring plants into that seed to sale tracking
[07:12.580 --> 07:13.760]  system.
[07:13.760 --> 07:18.700]  The governing body who regulates the plants coming into that system sort of turned a blind
[07:18.700 --> 07:23.360]  eye and allowed us to enter plants into that system for a limited amount of time.
[07:23.360 --> 07:25.760]  The plants had to come from somewhere.
[07:25.760 --> 07:30.600]  So for a short period of time, the marijuana enforcement division played dumb and acted
[07:30.600 --> 07:34.060]  like all of these plants were just part of some immaculate conception.
[07:34.060 --> 07:38.060]  These plants were just manifested and ended up in our grow facilities and entered into
[07:38.060 --> 07:39.060]  the computer.
[07:39.060 --> 07:40.700]  They did not know what else to do.
[07:40.700 --> 07:44.700]  There's not another way for plants to enter a market, to come from a non-legal market
[07:44.700 --> 07:45.740]  to a legal market.
[07:45.740 --> 07:47.900]  There had to be a way to get plants in.
[07:47.900 --> 07:49.300]  So that was the opportunity.
[07:49.300 --> 07:50.680]  They gave us a short time.
[07:50.680 --> 07:52.320]  We were able to enter our genetics.
[07:52.320 --> 07:55.200]  If you had seeds, there was a way to get those seeds in the system.
[07:55.200 --> 07:58.460]  If you had clones, there was a way to get your clones into the system.
[07:58.460 --> 08:00.740]  Those became your plants for the future.
[08:00.740 --> 08:06.020]  So now there has kind of been a door closed on the opportunity to enter new genetics into
[08:06.020 --> 08:13.940]  a medical or recreational cannabis facility in Colorado.
[08:13.940 --> 08:20.460]  Now if you want to introduce new genetics into your grow, they have to come from seeds
[08:20.460 --> 08:26.940]  which were produced within your marijuana enforcement division regulated facility.
[08:26.940 --> 08:31.580]  So you have to grow a plant and you have to find seeds within that plant.
[08:31.580 --> 08:36.080]  Then those seeds need to be entered into the system as new seeds.
[08:36.080 --> 08:37.460]  Then you can germinate the seeds.
[08:37.460 --> 08:38.900]  Then they become veg plants.
[08:38.900 --> 08:43.860]  There is a procedure that they follow in the computer system to document that process.
[08:43.860 --> 08:50.860]  So in theory, the entry time for new genetics in the facilities has been cut off unless
[08:50.860 --> 08:54.220]  those genetics are produced within a facility.
[08:54.220 --> 09:00.260]  So in theory, the only way to introduce new genetics would be to breed inside of a facility
[09:00.260 --> 09:03.220]  which is very costly and very ineffective.
[09:03.220 --> 09:08.340]  We need every gram of profitable flower to come out of that facility as possible.
[09:08.340 --> 09:11.220]  So we are struggling to produce all of the flower we can.
[09:11.220 --> 09:15.220]  We can't spend time making seeds in one of our rooms.
[09:15.220 --> 09:20.580]  What oftentimes happens is during harvest, we may discover a handful of seeds in one
[09:20.580 --> 09:21.580]  plant.
[09:21.580 --> 09:23.020]  We may be chopping it up and a bunch of seeds will go tink, tink, tink.
[09:23.020 --> 09:28.060]  And we'll go, hey, this whatever plant over here, plant number 76533 just dropped out
[09:28.060 --> 09:29.060]  a bunch of seeds.
[09:29.060 --> 09:33.700]  And then you go to the computer and you say, plant number 76533 dropped a bunch of seeds.
[09:33.700 --> 09:37.860]  You actually weigh the seeds so you can subtract that weight from your harvest total.
[09:37.860 --> 09:40.780]  You document how many seeds there were, which plant they come from.
[09:40.780 --> 09:43.620]  I already forgot the number 765 something fucking whatever.
[09:43.620 --> 09:45.340]  We fucking forgot what plant they came from.
[09:45.340 --> 09:46.340]  That happens a lot.
[09:46.340 --> 09:47.340]  Make up a number.
[09:47.340 --> 09:48.340]  That's what we do in the MED system.
[09:48.340 --> 09:49.340]  I'm just kidding you guys.
[09:49.340 --> 09:50.340]  That never happens.
[09:50.340 --> 09:51.340]  We always do it by the book.
[09:51.620 --> 09:55.020]  Find out where those plants came from, document the number, write it down, subtract the weight.
[09:55.020 --> 09:59.220]  Now you've got seeds in the computer with a parent plant that they came from.
[09:59.220 --> 10:02.660]  The MED would like to know the male and female.
[10:02.660 --> 10:05.660]  Oftentimes in a grow environment, who knows where they came from.
[10:05.660 --> 10:08.300]  If it's a commercial environment, it was probably a herm.
[10:08.300 --> 10:09.300]  It is not illegal.
[10:09.300 --> 10:11.220]  I don't know if I want to share this advice.
[10:11.220 --> 10:15.060]  It is not illegal to enter pollen into a commercial facility.
[10:15.060 --> 10:19.020]  If you own a facility, if you're the manager and you have got pollen, you can take your
[10:19.020 --> 10:23.700]  pollen and pollinate your grow at your own disposal if that's what you want to do.
[10:23.700 --> 10:24.900]  That is not illegal.
[10:24.900 --> 10:28.220]  The pollen is not regulated by the marijuana enforcement division.
[10:28.220 --> 10:32.320]  So if you do want to breed, that is an option in a commercial facility.
[10:32.320 --> 10:35.260]  But that is where the new genetics need to come from.
[10:35.260 --> 10:41.340]  So unless this facility acquired some of my genetics a long time ago during that window
[10:41.340 --> 10:46.620]  of opportunity, they do not have iRegenetic strains to work with.
[10:46.740 --> 10:51.500]  Now before these rules were put in place, some facilities and some people were able
[10:51.500 --> 10:56.020]  to acquire my seeds or my clones and enter them into their system.
[10:56.020 --> 11:00.220]  So at some facilities, there are iRegenetics plants in their grow.
[11:00.220 --> 11:03.380]  I have seen Lemon Jeffrey in several facilities.
[11:03.380 --> 11:04.700]  I've seen the Kalonji.
[11:04.700 --> 11:06.060]  I've seen the Capelton.
[11:06.060 --> 11:08.740]  And I've seen the Grateful Dog in a couple of facilities.
[11:08.740 --> 11:12.120]  But I really don't know where the plants have gone.
[11:12.120 --> 11:17.280]  We are able to transfer plants from facility to facility once they are in the system.
[11:17.280 --> 11:20.400]  But I don't know who has what and where they go.
[11:20.400 --> 11:27.160]  What I do know is that Apothecary Farms and Green Dot Labs do not have any iRegenetics
[11:27.160 --> 11:29.360]  in their stable at this time.
[11:29.360 --> 11:34.080]  Now one good thing about the extract market in Colorado is something known as a 50-50
[11:34.080 --> 11:35.080]  deal.
[11:35.080 --> 11:38.960]  This is a little bit of a business talk here for the Colorado concentrate market.
[11:38.960 --> 11:43.800]  There are a lot of different business strategies available for a concentrate company.
[11:43.800 --> 11:46.880]  But a very common practice is this.
[11:46.880 --> 11:50.360]  Hypothetically, let's say you are an extract company.
[11:50.360 --> 11:52.940]  You are Big Dick Jim's extract company.
[11:52.940 --> 11:54.360]  You are making concentrates.
[11:54.360 --> 11:58.360]  Your job is to make the best concentrates for the dispensary.
[11:58.360 --> 11:59.360]  You've got to grow.
[11:59.360 --> 12:01.600]  You grow your own flowers and you process those.
[12:01.600 --> 12:04.680]  You put them on the shelf and you've got a vertical line.
[12:04.680 --> 12:07.960]  You're growing, you're extracting, you're putting it on the shelf, and you're making
[12:07.960 --> 12:08.960]  money.
[12:08.960 --> 12:09.960]  There's nobody else involved.
[12:09.960 --> 12:11.180]  Maybe you've got your own store.
[12:11.180 --> 12:13.240]  Maybe it goes to a different retail location.
[12:13.240 --> 12:17.320]  Either way, as long as you're growing, extracting, and then selling the extract, you are making
[12:17.320 --> 12:18.880]  plenty of profits.
[12:18.880 --> 12:23.860]  Now at some point, your grow will slow down or you will be between harvests and you won't
[12:23.860 --> 12:25.780]  have anything to process.
[12:25.780 --> 12:27.120]  Now you're not making any money.
[12:27.120 --> 12:31.000]  You are only relying on that retail product that has been stocked on the shelf.
[12:31.000 --> 12:32.500]  That may run out.
[12:32.500 --> 12:39.820]  A great way for a concentrate company to make extra income and broaden their menu is what
[12:39.820 --> 12:42.460]  is known as a 50-50 deal.
[12:42.460 --> 12:47.500]  Let's say that there is another grow who wants concentrates but is not attached to a concentrate
[12:47.500 --> 12:48.540]  company.
[12:48.540 --> 12:53.820]  They will take their flowers or their trim material and give that material to the extraction
[12:53.820 --> 12:55.100]  company.
[12:55.100 --> 12:59.660]  That extraction company will do their job of processing your material into top shelf
[12:59.780 --> 13:05.700]  concentrates and they also package it into individual grams that are properly labeled
[13:05.700 --> 13:07.380]  for retail sale.
[13:07.380 --> 13:12.180]  Now once the flowers are processed, you have got a bulk batch of processed concentrates
[13:12.180 --> 13:15.220]  in retail ready containers.
[13:15.220 --> 13:19.140]  This is where a 50-50 deal quite often comes into play.
[13:19.140 --> 13:23.740]  The concentrate company needs to be paid for their extraction work.
[13:23.740 --> 13:24.860]  They did a lot of work.
[13:24.860 --> 13:25.860]  They did the processing.
[13:25.860 --> 13:27.420]  They trained employees to do it.
[13:27.420 --> 13:28.660]  They used equipment to do it.
[13:28.660 --> 13:29.660]  They packaged it.
[13:29.660 --> 13:31.940]  They probably paid for the packaging.
[13:31.940 --> 13:36.380]  So now there is a fee owed to that extraction company.
[13:36.380 --> 13:42.640]  Many times, the grower will let the extraction company keep 50% of the finished product as
[13:42.640 --> 13:43.900]  their payment.
[13:43.900 --> 13:49.020]  So if that commercial facility gives Big Dick Jim's extraction company so many grams of
[13:49.020 --> 13:55.500]  cannabis, they extract it and they turn it into 100 finished prepackaged grams of cannabis
[13:55.580 --> 13:57.660]  and they have reached a 50-50 deal.
[13:57.660 --> 14:03.540]  That means that the grow and the extraction company each leave with 50 grams of concentrate.
[14:03.540 --> 14:07.900]  Now that grow gets to put that concentrate on whatever retail shelf they want.
[14:07.900 --> 14:09.260]  They've got money to be made.
[14:09.260 --> 14:10.260]  They've got a product.
[14:10.260 --> 14:11.380]  They can sell that.
[14:11.380 --> 14:16.240]  The concentrate company in turn puts those concentrates on their shelves.
[14:16.240 --> 14:20.480]  They have just doubled their inventory and hopefully in that process, they've added some
[14:20.480 --> 14:23.660]  new flavors and added some variety to their menu.
[14:23.660 --> 14:25.020]  So that is a 50-50 deal.
[14:25.540 --> 14:29.060]  They run the product, then they split it 50-50 with the grower.
[14:29.060 --> 14:30.900]  The grower sells it however they want.
[14:30.900 --> 14:32.520]  At their retail end, it's got to stay legal.
[14:32.520 --> 14:34.860]  This all stays in the legal market.
[14:34.860 --> 14:39.220]  Then the extraction company puts it on their shelf and they sell it at their store.
[14:39.220 --> 14:41.700]  That is how they get paid on their end.
[14:41.700 --> 14:45.780]  Another thing that can happen sometimes is the original grower will buy back the product.
[14:45.780 --> 14:48.100]  If they run it, they've got 100 grams at the end.
[14:48.100 --> 14:51.900]  They sell it back to them at a premium price, which is pre-agreed upon before the extraction
[14:51.900 --> 14:52.900]  is run.
[14:52.900 --> 14:56.500]  So if they run the material, then the grower actually buys it all back from them.
[14:56.500 --> 15:00.020]  Then they send it to their retail location and they can put it on their retail store
[15:00.020 --> 15:03.360]  or they can spread it out to other retail locations.
[15:03.360 --> 15:04.680]  Maybe they've got multiple stores.
[15:04.680 --> 15:06.480]  They want to spread it out to different stores.
[15:06.480 --> 15:09.240]  Maybe they've got a wholesale deal lined up to where they already have a customer that
[15:09.240 --> 15:12.780]  wants to buy a bunch of it and then they can put that on their shelves.
[15:12.780 --> 15:17.140]  But in most cases, it is either a 50-50 deal where the extraction company ends up with
[15:17.140 --> 15:22.020]  half of the final product and the grower or the facility ends up with the other half of
[15:22.140 --> 15:26.220]  the final product and that gets transferred to a retail store, or it is a buyback deal
[15:26.220 --> 15:30.500]  where the grow sends the material and then they run it and they say, there's 100 grams.
[15:30.500 --> 15:32.180]  We'll sell it back to you at this much.
[15:32.180 --> 15:33.180]  They buy it back.
[15:33.180 --> 15:36.700]  Then they put it on the retail shelf and they market up quite liberally.
[15:36.700 --> 15:39.380]  That is where the money is made in the concentrates.
[15:39.380 --> 15:44.100]  So that is the long explanation of why when you hear me talking about what I am dabbing
[15:44.100 --> 15:49.380]  on the podcast, it is rarely an iregenetic strain because most of my stuff is not in
[15:49.380 --> 15:52.940]  the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division system.
[15:52.940 --> 15:57.420]  A few facilities do have it, but you have to find a facility that has got the plant,
[15:57.420 --> 16:02.340]  who has also ran the extraction, who also has it on the shelf available in my area for
[16:02.340 --> 16:04.380]  a desirable price.
[16:04.380 --> 16:07.420]  Those are a lot of variables to hit.
[16:07.420 --> 16:12.740]  Sometimes elevations in Colorado Springs will have some wonderful Lemon Jeffrey concentrates,
[16:12.740 --> 16:16.860]  but they also let different concentrate makers make the product.
[16:16.860 --> 16:21.580]  They let different companies run the material so the product comes out differently through
[16:21.580 --> 16:23.140]  each processor.
[16:23.140 --> 16:27.180]  Some of those processors I approve of, some of them I will not buy their product.
[16:27.180 --> 16:32.660]  So sometimes they may have Lemon Jeffrey concentrates on the shelf and I still might pass on it.
[16:32.660 --> 16:35.140]  So that is part of why I'm not smoking my own concentrates.
[16:35.140 --> 16:37.980]  There is another little branch to this question.
[16:37.980 --> 16:40.180]  You see me growing a lot of flowers on social media.
[16:40.180 --> 16:42.380]  I post a lot of pictures of quality flowers.
[16:42.380 --> 16:43.740]  I am a breeder.
[16:43.740 --> 16:47.660]  Most of what I am growing is loaded with seeds.
[16:47.660 --> 16:51.820]  Most of the seeded plants do not make quality hash material.
[16:51.820 --> 16:56.100]  It is so beat up by the time I take the seeds out of it, that it is a waste of time for
[16:56.100 --> 16:57.600]  a concentrate maker.
[16:57.600 --> 17:01.340]  The concentrate maker could have ran quality product and had much better results.
[17:01.340 --> 17:04.740]  They don't want to waste their time on my beat up seeded material.
[17:04.740 --> 17:07.460]  So I don't have that made into concentrates.
[17:07.460 --> 17:11.020]  That is usually given to friends and they turn it into edibles because they do it with
[17:11.020 --> 17:14.260]  their own small personal time, their personal kitchen.
[17:14.260 --> 17:15.900]  We're not using a lot of big space.
[17:15.900 --> 17:18.640]  We're not wasting a lot of time, not wasting anybody's energy.
[17:18.640 --> 17:21.540]  So I give it away to people and they make edibles out of it.
[17:21.540 --> 17:25.100]  That is what happens to the material from the seeded plants.
[17:25.100 --> 17:29.220]  Now when you do see me doing pheno hunts of my new seed runs, because once I breed seeds,
[17:29.220 --> 17:31.420]  the next step is to grow them and see what I have created.
[17:31.420 --> 17:32.420]  That's part of the fun.
[17:32.420 --> 17:34.260]  That's one of my favorite parts.
[17:34.260 --> 17:35.740]  Those buds are finished.
[17:35.740 --> 17:37.200]  They are not seeded.
[17:37.200 --> 17:41.640]  Most of the time I take those buds with me to events like the Indow Expo or the Dude
[17:41.640 --> 17:47.720]  Grow Show or whatever vending event or community event or social event may be happening this
[17:47.720 --> 17:48.720]  week.
[17:48.720 --> 17:50.520]  I took a bunch of cannabis to the Fish Concerts.
[17:50.520 --> 17:52.800]  I did not bring any of the cannabis I took with me back.
[17:52.800 --> 17:54.800]  We smoked every single bud.
[17:54.800 --> 17:57.280]  So that is what happens to most of the flower I grow.
[17:57.280 --> 17:58.280]  I take it to events.
[17:58.280 --> 17:59.360]  I take it to concerts.
[17:59.360 --> 18:01.320]  I smoke and share it with my friends.
[18:01.320 --> 18:04.680]  If you show up at my house and you're like, I haven't had weed in a couple of days, we'll
[18:04.680 --> 18:08.400]  make sure you leave here with a couple of buds and stoned as fuck.
[18:08.400 --> 18:10.560]  So that's what happens to my flower.
[18:10.560 --> 18:15.840]  You see all those pictures of seeded plants, all that finger bank material gets given away.
[18:15.840 --> 18:17.520]  People make edibles out of it.
[18:17.520 --> 18:22.000]  Then those buds you see from the pheno hunt runs, those nice photogenic buds, I smoke
[18:22.000 --> 18:24.520]  those with all of my friends at the events.
[18:24.520 --> 18:27.600]  I had multiple jars on the table at the Dude Grows Cup.
[18:27.600 --> 18:31.440]  I had multiple jars on the table at the Concentration Celebration.
[18:31.440 --> 18:34.800]  I had several jars on the table at the Indo Expo.
[18:34.800 --> 18:37.840]  I smoke all of that cannabis with all of my friends.
[18:37.840 --> 18:39.520]  So that's what happens to all of that material.
[18:39.520 --> 18:40.960]  All right, podcast rule.
[18:40.960 --> 18:42.000]  That got really carried away.
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.140]  That took much longer than I had anticipated.
[18:44.140 --> 18:47.120]  So we're going to jump right to the next bullet point really quickly.
[18:47.120 --> 18:49.480]  No more testers is my next bullet point.
[18:49.480 --> 18:54.040]  Recently on the podcast, I mentioned that I need some people to test a few new seeds
[18:54.040 --> 18:56.200]  for me.
[18:56.200 --> 18:57.200]  Thank you.
[18:57.200 --> 18:58.800]  My email inbox exploded.
[18:58.800 --> 19:02.440]  I have never gotten more emails and please stop.
[19:02.440 --> 19:04.000]  I found enough testers.
[19:04.000 --> 19:08.240]  I may have read your email and not replied yet because I got so many that I'm kind of
[19:08.240 --> 19:11.420]  filtering through them and looking for my favorites.
[19:11.420 --> 19:14.440]  Don't be offended if I did not select you as a tester this time.
[19:14.440 --> 19:19.220]  You are still in my potential testers folder that I will go back to in the future when
[19:19.220 --> 19:23.020]  I'm looking for more people to test new strains.
[19:23.020 --> 19:28.520]  So big thank you to everybody who responded and replied to my request for people to apply
[19:28.740 --> 19:30.480]  to be a tester of my genetics.
[19:30.480 --> 19:35.360]  I got so many responses that it was overwhelming and it was tremendous.
[19:35.360 --> 19:36.360]  Thank you.
[19:36.360 --> 19:37.360]  I'm still going through the emails.
[19:37.360 --> 19:38.640]  It has been quite a while.
[19:38.640 --> 19:40.700]  I get more messages every day.
[19:40.700 --> 19:43.000]  If you were listening to this episode now, please stop.
[19:43.000 --> 19:44.000]  I've gotten enough.
[19:44.000 --> 19:45.760]  My inbox is going crazy, you guys.
[19:45.760 --> 19:47.280]  I appreciate it and I love it.
[19:47.280 --> 19:50.580]  It is just overwhelming and I'm never going to catch up on all of the emails.
[19:50.580 --> 19:53.560]  So if you've sent me an email and I haven't replied, I apologize.
[19:53.560 --> 19:56.700]  I am digging through all of those emails and I will get to it.
[19:56.700 --> 20:01.540]  It may take a minute, but I will answer every single message that has come to that inbox.
[20:01.540 --> 20:04.580]  Again, thank you for the overwhelming response.
[20:04.580 --> 20:05.980]  I do appreciate it.
[20:05.980 --> 20:07.900]  Again, I'm going to add onto that.
[20:07.900 --> 20:12.820]  If you have sent me a grow question, a cannabis question, a cannabis culture question, and
[20:12.820 --> 20:16.700]  I have not replied to you, please do not get offended or frustrated.
[20:16.700 --> 20:22.100]  I took a four day vacation and I ended up being about six days behind on emails.
[20:22.100 --> 20:24.860]  I don't know how the fuck that worked, but it did.
[20:24.860 --> 20:26.020]  So I am catching up.
[20:26.020 --> 20:29.940]  I am always going to be about a day and a half behind emails, it feels like, until we
[20:29.940 --> 20:32.460]  get a holiday and you guys all take a day off and I don't.
[20:32.460 --> 20:34.300]  That's the only way I'm going to catch up.
[20:34.300 --> 20:37.140]  So if you have not gotten a reply, I apologize.
[20:37.140 --> 20:39.100]  It is nothing personal.
[20:39.100 --> 20:41.580]  There are thousands of you and one of me.
[20:41.580 --> 20:43.180]  I'm doing my best to catch up.
[20:43.180 --> 20:47.380]  I appreciate all of the interaction and all of the support.
[20:47.380 --> 20:51.960]  This podcast has gotten very popular in the past few months.
[20:51.960 --> 20:54.460]  My listens have doubled in the past couple of months.
[20:54.460 --> 20:58.300]  I want to send a big thank you to all of my friends who have shared the show and helped
[20:58.300 --> 20:59.900]  expand my audience.
[20:59.900 --> 21:00.900]  It means a lot to me.
[21:00.900 --> 21:03.300]  It also means a lot more emails.
[21:03.300 --> 21:07.260]  So with the growth, I may slow down a little bit on the personal replies.
[21:07.260 --> 21:08.300]  That's just how it goes.
[21:08.300 --> 21:09.300]  I apologize.
[21:09.300 --> 21:13.620]  Also, my seed company, iRegenetics, has been taking off.
[21:13.620 --> 21:17.140]  So I have been getting even more emails for that company.
[21:17.140 --> 21:22.060]  The Grow From Your Heart podcast and iRegenetics is all a one man show.
[21:22.060 --> 21:23.220]  It is all me.
[21:23.220 --> 21:28.740]  The growing, the breeding, the writing the podcast, the producing, the editing the podcast,
[21:28.740 --> 21:32.740]  all of that stuff, the packaging of the seeds is all done by myself.
[21:32.740 --> 21:34.260]  So please be patient with me.
[21:34.260 --> 21:40.140]  I love and respect and I'm very thankful and grateful for each and every person who supports
[21:40.140 --> 21:43.260]  iRegenetics and the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[21:43.260 --> 21:45.060]  It does mean the world to me.
[21:45.060 --> 21:47.980]  Please do not feel like I'm ignoring you or forgetting about you.
[21:47.980 --> 21:50.880]  There are just a lot of you to try to keep up with.
[21:50.880 --> 21:55.360]  So big thanks and much respect for making my dreams come true.
[21:55.360 --> 22:00.680]  Without you as an audience, without you as my supporters, my dreams would not be happening.
[22:00.680 --> 22:01.680]  I know that.
[22:01.680 --> 22:02.680]  So thank you.
[22:02.680 --> 22:06.440]  I'm not going to forget about the people who made this happen.
[22:06.440 --> 22:10.960]  So again, please do not ever feel like I am skipping your email, like I'm ignoring your
[22:10.960 --> 22:11.960]  email.
[22:11.960 --> 22:16.640]  I want to answer every message that is in my inbox, but it is going to take me a little
[22:16.640 --> 22:18.120]  bit of time to catch up.
[22:18.120 --> 22:20.800]  So please continue to listen to the show.
[22:20.840 --> 22:22.160]  Keep sending messages.
[22:22.160 --> 22:23.160]  Don't stop.
[22:23.160 --> 22:25.960]  And I will catch up and I will get to your message in due time.
[22:25.960 --> 22:29.560]  All right, I've got one more thing I'd like to talk about, and then we're going to wrap
[22:29.560 --> 22:31.520]  up this episode.
[22:31.520 --> 22:37.360]  I recently did an episode talking about dab pens and smoking concentrates.
[22:37.360 --> 22:42.960]  We got into that conversation again on the Embracing Organics podcast live on YouTube,
[22:42.960 --> 22:50.120]  where I was asked the question, how do you politely decline somebody's dab pen or questionable
[22:50.200 --> 22:51.680]  concentrate?
[22:51.680 --> 22:57.280]  Being in my position in the cannabis community, many people want to smoke with me.
[22:57.280 --> 22:59.360]  Many people want to dab me out.
[22:59.360 --> 23:04.960]  A lot of people want to find me at an event and come to my booth and give me a dab just
[23:04.960 --> 23:07.600]  to show that they love me, that they're my friend.
[23:07.600 --> 23:09.540]  They want to share their concentrate with me.
[23:09.540 --> 23:10.540]  They want to show some respect.
[23:10.540 --> 23:13.720]  And they also just want to say, I dabbed with Rasta Jeff.
[23:13.720 --> 23:14.920]  I understand that.
[23:14.920 --> 23:16.040]  I respect that.
[23:16.040 --> 23:17.900]  And I appreciate it.
[23:17.900 --> 23:24.940]  But sometimes those people show up with the scariest questionable concentrates that I
[23:24.940 --> 23:27.420]  do not want to consume.
[23:27.420 --> 23:29.580]  I also want to be polite.
[23:29.580 --> 23:32.820]  I also want to remain friends with everybody.
[23:32.820 --> 23:36.300]  I also don't want to belittle anybody's product.
[23:36.300 --> 23:38.700]  Maybe they made that concentrate themselves.
[23:38.700 --> 23:40.260]  Maybe they grew the flower.
[23:40.260 --> 23:41.940]  Maybe they're extremely proud of it.
[23:41.940 --> 23:46.980]  And I don't want to be the person who tells them that is doo-doo and I do not approve.
[23:47.060 --> 23:51.860]  So somebody politely said, what is the best way around that situation?
[23:51.860 --> 23:53.780]  And I'll tell you how I handle it.
[23:53.780 --> 23:58.580]  If you approach me and you have got some dabs that I'm not really sure I want to dab, I'm
[23:58.580 --> 23:59.580]  going to keep talking.
[23:59.580 --> 24:01.580]  You're going to say, hey Rasta Jeff, I brought you a dab.
[24:01.580 --> 24:03.060]  And I'm going to go, oh man, let me check that out.
[24:03.060 --> 24:04.060]  And I'm going to look at it.
[24:04.060 --> 24:06.900]  And I'm going to keep talking until you forgot that you offered me a dab.
[24:06.900 --> 24:07.900]  That looks pretty good, bro.
[24:07.900 --> 24:08.900]  What strain is that?
[24:08.900 --> 24:09.900]  Cool, man.
[24:09.900 --> 24:10.900]  How'd you make that?
[24:10.900 --> 24:11.900]  Cool, bro.
[24:11.900 --> 24:12.900]  How long did you let the flowers grow?
[24:12.900 --> 24:13.900]  How long did you flush it?
[24:13.900 --> 24:14.900]  What's your process?
[24:14.900 --> 24:15.900]  Tell me about it.
[24:15.900 --> 24:18.220]  So you're going to concentrate a little bit and you're so focused on your garden, you're
[24:18.220 --> 24:19.560]  getting excited.
[24:19.560 --> 24:22.300]  While you're getting excited, I'm going to reach back and I'm going to grab some of my
[24:22.300 --> 24:23.300]  Green Dot Labs.
[24:23.300 --> 24:24.300]  What do I got here?
[24:24.300 --> 24:26.100]  I got some Soul Cleanser from Green Dot Labs.
[24:26.100 --> 24:28.460]  I got some India Pale from Green Dot Labs.
[24:28.460 --> 24:31.140]  I'm going to grab one of these and I'm going to let you tell me about your grow and I'm
[24:31.140 --> 24:33.660]  going to open the lid and I'm going to scoop up a pretty good dab.
[24:33.660 --> 24:36.380]  And while you're talking, I'm going to heat up the dab nail.
[24:36.380 --> 24:40.120]  And then when the dab nail's the appropriate heat, I'm going to hand you the dabber and
[24:40.120 --> 24:41.120]  give you the dabber.
[24:41.120 --> 24:43.260]  I can go, hey man, take a dab of this Green Dot.
[24:43.260 --> 24:46.740]  And you're going to take a dab and you're going to go, I'm fucking stoned.
[24:46.740 --> 24:50.340]  And then you're going to forget you even offered me a dab of your questionable concentrates
[24:50.340 --> 24:51.760]  and I'm out of it.
[24:51.760 --> 24:53.040]  Don't have to worry about it.
[24:53.040 --> 24:54.040]  You're stoned.
[24:54.040 --> 24:55.380]  I'm already stoned.
[24:55.380 --> 24:58.460]  If you keep pressing, I may go, oh man, I'm going to try some of this.
[24:58.460 --> 25:02.000]  And then I'm just going to take a dab of mine and then act like I forgot to dab yours.
[25:02.000 --> 25:06.480]  So the best way to kind of switch it up and get out of dabbing a questionable concentrate
[25:06.480 --> 25:11.980]  is to pull out yours and politely offer that person some of your concentrate and flip the
[25:11.980 --> 25:17.500]  script, switch it up, be a salesman, keep talking, don't stop, keep moving, overwhelm
[25:17.500 --> 25:21.880]  their thoughts, reprogram them that they want a dab of your shit and they'll forget.
[25:21.880 --> 25:23.940]  So that is how I get around it.
[25:23.940 --> 25:27.200]  I am kind of afraid to take concentrates from other people.
[25:27.200 --> 25:32.960]  I am absolutely afraid to hit a vape pen or a dab pen from a company I am not familiar
[25:32.960 --> 25:33.960]  with.
[25:33.960 --> 25:39.480]  So in the future, if you offer me a concentrate or a vape or maybe even flowers and I politely
[25:39.480 --> 25:42.020]  decline, it has nothing to do with you.
[25:42.020 --> 25:47.500]  It has everything to do with popcorn lung and me not trusting other companies and other
[25:47.500 --> 25:48.500]  makers.
[25:48.500 --> 25:49.500]  I have to be careful.
[25:49.500 --> 25:51.340]  We all have to be careful at this time.
[25:51.340 --> 25:53.940]  Protect yourself, protect your lungs, protect your health.
