[01:00.540 --> 01:06.420]  what I'm smoking. Today I've been taking dabs of gunslinger remix live batter
[01:06.420 --> 01:11.780]  from Green Dot Labs. This is a blend of starfighter and star dog on the package.
[01:11.780 --> 01:16.460]  The flavor is described as sour fruit and fuel. I think I agree with all of
[01:16.460 --> 01:21.940]  those flavor and aroma combos. I'm really enjoying the buzz from the gunslinger
[01:21.940 --> 01:27.260]  remix batter. Most of the time when I hit a dab I feel like I get nice and high. I
[01:27.260 --> 01:30.940]  smoke myself into a panic attack. I like to smoke until my eyes are bugging out
[01:30.940 --> 01:33.980]  so I'm jittery till I'm looking around the room kind of giggling a little bit
[01:33.980 --> 01:38.780]  got a silly look on my face. When I smoke the gunslinger it does the opposite.
[01:38.780 --> 01:42.900]  It makes me chill the fuck out. It makes me sit down. It makes me slow down a
[01:42.900 --> 01:47.620]  little bit and I think I really needed a nice chill out concentrate. So big shout
[01:47.620 --> 01:52.980]  out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the perfect gunslinger remix live
[01:52.980 --> 01:59.060]  batter. Alright podcast world in this episode I'm going to read a little rant
[01:59.060 --> 02:03.460]  that I wrote that was intended for a social media post but I figured that it
[02:03.500 --> 02:07.380]  would be more useful here on the podcast so I've got a lot of stuff written down
[02:07.380 --> 02:11.380]  that I want to kind of read and turn into a rant for you. Before we get there
[02:11.380 --> 02:16.540]  let's show some love to the 710 Club. The 710 Club are the folks who support the
[02:16.540 --> 02:22.060]  show on patreon. The $7.10 a month level or higher. So let's start off
[02:22.060 --> 02:26.260]  with some shout outs. Let's send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you

[03:46.880 --> 03:52.100]  the video description to make it easy for all of my friends. Alright I do have
[03:52.100 --> 03:55.940]  a couple of things I want to ramble about before we jump into the main topic
[03:55.940 --> 03:59.900]  of the show. Most of you guys that follow guys and gals that follow the
[03:59.900 --> 04:03.820]  show know that I have been breeding with a Jack the Ripper male. I've got a very
[04:03.820 --> 04:08.180]  small breeding area that I've dedicated to a Jack the Ripper experiment. I got
[04:08.180 --> 04:12.700]  some seeds of Jack. I found a beautiful male in there. That male has pollinated
[04:12.700 --> 04:16.860]  several select females. I've talked about a lot of the ladies it's pollinated on
[04:16.860 --> 04:21.100]  the show. There are a couple of Jack the Ripper females in there. There's a lemon
[04:21.100 --> 04:25.140]  skunk. There's a blueberry cookies. There is a golden goat. I'm not sure what else
[04:25.140 --> 04:28.540]  I have revealed. We'll say today that there is a platinum tangy in there that
[04:28.540 --> 04:32.620]  also got pollinated by the Jack the Ripper. There may have been a grateful
[04:32.620 --> 04:36.220]  dog in there. So I'm revealing more today on the show than I think I have in the
[04:36.220 --> 04:40.140]  past but there should be some wonderful crosses coming from a Jack the Ripper
[04:40.140 --> 04:45.940]  male in the future. They look great you guys. In my humble opinion these plants
[04:45.940 --> 04:51.580]  look amazing. This is my first breeding run under LED lighting and the LEDs are
[04:51.580 --> 04:57.340]  making the plants look beautiful. The leaves look thicker. The leaves feel
[04:57.340 --> 05:03.540]  healthier, fatter, thicker, more lively. There's just more leaf there. The leaves
[05:03.540 --> 05:06.900]  used to feel I would say they used to feel like one sheet of paper. Now I'm
[05:06.900 --> 05:10.940]  kind of comparing I would say they're about two maybe three sheets of paper
[05:10.940 --> 05:14.540]  thick. Now they're two pieces of paper thick. They are much thicker, much more
[05:14.540 --> 05:18.140]  robust. They just seem healthier. They're more vibrant. They have better
[05:18.140 --> 05:22.420]  colors. The plants just appear healthier and happier. As a grower who's been
[05:22.420 --> 05:26.020]  growing for a hundred years, a lot of crops under my belt, a lot of different
[05:26.020 --> 05:29.940]  strains and different genetics. I think the plants look overall happier
[05:29.940 --> 05:33.980]  underneath the LED lighting. I don't think they like that bright yellow. Do
[05:33.980 --> 05:37.180]  you like that bright yellow light from the HPS? I don't think the plants are
[05:37.180 --> 05:40.740]  digging it either and my photos look way better. I don't have to manipulate my
[05:40.780 --> 05:44.940]  photography because I'm getting photo quality lighting on my plants already
[05:44.940 --> 05:49.540]  when I go to take a photo. So the plants are looking much better underneath the
[05:49.540 --> 05:54.460]  LEDs. I'm really excited with the growth. They grew very quickly. The seeds seem to
[05:54.460 --> 05:59.300]  be hardening up quite quickly as well. The seeds are fat. The seeds that I can
[05:59.300 --> 06:04.180]  see in the buds are fat. Being a breeder, the way that I test to see how far along
[06:04.180 --> 06:08.060]  the seeds are, how close to being ready they are, I'll find a seeded bud. I'll
[06:08.180 --> 06:12.380]  just pull a couple of parts right off it. A couple pods, a couple calyxes. I was
[06:12.380 --> 06:15.420]  gonna say a couple of seeds right off of there. Just pick them right off. You can
[06:15.420 --> 06:18.460]  see them. Shake them out of the calyx. Rub the calyx off of it. Rub the outer
[06:18.460 --> 06:21.700]  coating off and the seeds will fall in your hand. You can tell the ripeness, the
[06:21.700 --> 06:25.420]  maturity of that seed. The seeds that are coming out of these plants are not done
[06:25.420 --> 06:29.300]  quite yet but they are fat, you guys. They're looking huge. They've got some
[06:29.300 --> 06:33.220]  good color, some good stripes going on on them. I'm excited for these seeds.
[06:33.460 --> 06:38.780]  Something else I've noticed, it was 102 degrees today. If I would have been
[06:38.780 --> 06:44.460]  running my normal thousand watt HPS light in that room where these two Canon
[06:44.460 --> 06:48.940]  LEDs are, it would have been too hot. It simply would have been too hot. I'm
[06:48.940 --> 06:53.140]  getting as much performance, as much plant growth. I'll have as much seed, as
[06:53.140 --> 07:00.940]  much biomass from two 325 watt LEDs that I was getting from a thousand watt HPS
[07:01.060 --> 07:05.740]  light and the HPS light required more cooling. It ran hotter. It made the
[07:05.740 --> 07:10.460]  electric bill higher and my plants didn't enjoy it as much. So I am really
[07:10.460 --> 07:14.740]  convincing myself that in a home environment, LEDs may be the way to go
[07:14.740 --> 07:18.260]  for me. I don't know about for you. Don't send me an email saying that you hate me
[07:18.260 --> 07:22.620]  because of that. It may be the way to go for me. I do want to make the disclaimer
[07:22.620 --> 07:26.980]  in a big commercial grow in a giant space, I'm still set on using double
[07:27.180 --> 07:31.020]  ended Govitas. I like that for my commercial grows. That's my way. But in a
[07:31.020 --> 07:34.420]  home grow environment and a small environment in a personal production
[07:34.420 --> 07:39.860]  situation, a small breeding project area, some Canon LEDs are the way to go in my
[07:39.860 --> 07:44.900]  opinion at this time. I keep talking about these Jack the Ripper crosses. I am
[07:44.900 --> 07:49.660]  a known seed breeder and a seed seller. They are not ready yet. I do need to make
[07:49.660 --> 07:53.620]  the disclaimer every time I talk about them. They are not ready yet. They won't
[07:53.620 --> 07:58.340]  be done for probably 15 to 25 days. I'm guessing I have to pay attention to the
[07:58.340 --> 08:01.460]  seeds. This is a new project. I'm not sure how long the seeds are going to
[08:01.460 --> 08:05.740]  take to finish up. Got to pay attention. When they are done. I'll harvest the
[08:05.740 --> 08:09.460]  plants. I've given this rant before you guys takes two weeks to dry more time
[08:09.460 --> 08:13.300]  for me to get to it more time to package it up, then I'm going to grow it, then
[08:13.340 --> 08:16.820]  friends of mine will grow it, then maybe you'll get a chance to grow it. I know
[08:16.820 --> 08:21.300]  you guys want these seeds. I grew them to get them out to people. Be patient, give
[08:21.300 --> 08:24.660]  me time. Let me make sure that they're worth a shit before I send them to you
[08:24.660 --> 08:29.620]  so I don't waste your time, space and energy in your garden. That is a good way
[08:29.620 --> 08:33.860]  to segue into the rant that I've got prepared for the show before I get there.
[08:33.940 --> 08:38.020]  Let me give a giant shout out to my friend Keith at Black Sale Market. I'm
[08:38.020 --> 08:42.380]  running his Canon LED lights and I haven't been more. I don't know what's
[08:42.380 --> 08:45.260]  the word I'm excited but there's a better word for it. I haven't wanted to
[08:45.260 --> 08:50.580]  share my success with a product like I do the LEDs in a long time. I get a lot
[08:50.580 --> 08:54.660]  of toys. I buy a lot of shit. I experiment with a lot of products. I buy
[08:54.660 --> 08:57.700]  products at the growth store just off the shelf. I go and people are like, we
[08:57.700 --> 09:00.940]  would have given you that. I'm like, I know, but I'm a consumer. I wanted to
[09:00.940 --> 09:04.140]  consume it. I want to give you money and support your company and keep your
[09:04.140 --> 09:08.660]  things going. My point is I buy a lot of shit. I don't talk about all of it on
[09:08.660 --> 09:12.140]  the show. I only talk about shit that really makes me happy, really makes me
[09:12.140 --> 09:17.100]  skip, hop and jump. We got new millennium nutrients and Canon LED lights are the
[09:17.100 --> 09:21.020]  latest things that made me do cartwheels in my grow, made me say damn
[09:21.020 --> 09:24.180]  that really made a difference and was worth the investment. So that's my ass
[09:24.180 --> 09:27.980]  kissing for Black Sale Market. I'm not kissing their ass. I really do appreciate
[09:27.980 --> 09:31.820]  the product. I paid for the lights. I love them. I will buy more. I recommend
[09:31.820 --> 09:35.460]  those lights. Alright, I'm sure they've got a website, BlackSaleMarket.com.
[09:35.460 --> 09:38.620]  Probably I should have been more prepared. Do follow them on social media.
[09:38.620 --> 09:42.900]  Shout out to you Keith. Big respect. Can't wait to hang out. Now I was talking
[09:43.060 --> 09:47.580]  about transitioning into the main topic of the show. I lost my train of thought,
[09:47.580 --> 09:52.260]  but we can get right into here. I'm looking at social media. I'm scrolling
[09:52.260 --> 09:55.580]  through and honestly, it drives me crazy. A lot of the things that I see on social
[09:55.580 --> 09:59.540]  media. Part of why I started this podcast is because people ask, hey, why do my
[09:59.540 --> 10:03.180]  plants look like this on social media and somebody's got a simple problem, but
[10:03.180 --> 10:07.340]  then somebody will respond with, hey, have you thought about maybe you've got
[10:07.340 --> 10:10.660]  this kind of fungus or maybe you've got this kind of aphid or maybe you've got
[10:10.660 --> 10:14.700]  this kind of mite and that is not the issue at all. But now you've put that
[10:14.700 --> 10:19.220]  idea into that person's head and now instead of solving the simple issue they
[10:19.220 --> 10:23.140]  started with, they're also trying to get rid of the fungus, get rid of the mites
[10:23.140 --> 10:26.660]  and correct the other problem that you invented for them because there are new
[10:26.660 --> 10:30.140]  growers and they're paranoid and you just put these ideas in their head and it's a
[10:30.140 --> 10:34.060]  lot like WebMD. If you look at your plant, you got a small problem. You go,
[10:34.060 --> 10:38.660]  oh no, small discoloration on two leaves. I need to look up what's going on. You go
[10:38.660 --> 10:42.700]  ask Facebook, hey, what's going on? It's very similar to if I got a small pain
[10:42.700 --> 10:46.140]  right here underneath my rib. It just feels weird when I breathe in or if I
[10:46.140 --> 10:50.820]  move my right arm, you go fucking Google that and WebMD tells you, ah, you've got
[10:50.820 --> 10:54.460]  cancer, you've got seven kinds of AIDS, your eyes are gonna come out and you're
[10:54.460 --> 10:59.500]  going to die before the sun comes up. Unfortunately, Facebook and social media
[10:59.500 --> 11:03.300]  sites are the same fucking thing for grow advice. You say, I've got a couple
[11:03.300 --> 11:07.940]  of little yellow spots and somebody says, you've got thrips, spider mites, aphids
[11:07.940 --> 11:12.340]  and plant herpes all at once. You need to use plant therapy, spray it with
[11:12.340 --> 11:16.980]  rubbing alcohol and then feed it a cup of piss. And I'm like, um, what, what are
[11:16.980 --> 11:22.100]  you guys doing? What are you guys doing? So that shit drives me crazy. I try to go
[11:22.100 --> 11:27.180]  on social media sites and Facebook and things to give helpful advice. I found a
[11:27.180 --> 11:30.900]  lot of resistance. They don't want good helpful advice. They want bickering and
[11:30.900 --> 11:34.580]  rambling. So you'll see me less on the social media sites. You'll see me more
[11:34.580 --> 11:37.580]  here doing this sort of stuff. This is more valuable. This is where it needs to
[11:37.580 --> 11:42.180]  happen to me for me. But here is something that I saw a lot of happening
[11:42.220 --> 11:46.820]  on social media. This is the most current thing that people are talking about and
[11:46.820 --> 11:49.620]  experiencing. And I've got a lot of notes. So I'm just going to jump right
[11:49.620 --> 11:54.180]  into my notes. Too many people have failed to do pre selection before putting
[11:54.180 --> 11:58.020]  their plants outdoors. I see a lot of people with giant plants outdoors.
[11:58.020 --> 12:01.100]  They've been growing for months. They've got these giant bushes. You guys are as
[12:01.100 --> 12:03.780]  big as me. They're tall. They're proud. They're standing next to it with their
[12:03.780 --> 12:07.180]  thumb up with their arm around the plant. Like look at my big ass plant. They
[12:07.180 --> 12:10.220]  spent a lot of money on nutrients and soil. They built these cute little
[12:10.220 --> 12:13.980]  outdoor beds. They built a nice protective barrier to keep animals away.
[12:14.220 --> 12:16.820]  They've been defoliating. They've popped them. They've twisted them. They've
[12:16.820 --> 12:20.220]  trained the plants. The plants look sexy. They look fucking marvelous. They've
[12:20.220 --> 12:23.900]  been working on them since like May. They've been outside working on them
[12:23.900 --> 12:27.580]  since like April. In some places, they put them out real early if they can.
[12:27.580 --> 12:30.860]  They've been working on them indoors. They've been defoliating, twisting,
[12:30.860 --> 12:34.580]  topping, popping, manipulating, fucking training these plants, treating it like a
[12:34.860 --> 12:38.300]  prize pony going to the state fair, a prize horse, prize cow. That's what I'm
[12:38.300 --> 12:41.580]  looking for. Prize cow going to the state fair. That was not my realm at all.
[12:41.580 --> 12:46.900]  But they took good care of this plant. So now it's August. Starting to flower.
[12:47.660 --> 12:52.660]  Guess what? A lot of these people are realizing they put male plants outside
[12:52.740 --> 12:55.540]  and they've taken care of them for months. They spent a bunch of time,
[12:55.540 --> 13:00.700]  energy, money on useless and potentially problematic plants.
[13:00.700 --> 13:04.060]  Problematic is a word that I wrote down here. Potentially problematic.
[13:05.860 --> 13:10.580]  Not only did you waste time, energy, money, space. If it's illegal, you wasted
[13:10.580 --> 13:13.700]  the fucking sweat because if it's an illegal area, it's a whole new realm
[13:13.700 --> 13:17.700]  growing. That's a whole new level of stress. You start acting weird to your
[13:17.700 --> 13:20.580]  friends and your family because you got that fucking crime in the backyard or
[13:20.580 --> 13:24.900]  wherever. Either way, you just wasted a bunch of time growing a male plant.
[13:24.940 --> 13:30.060]  That is waste. That's wasteful. Also, why do I say it's potentially
[13:30.060 --> 13:34.620]  problematic? Because you're not only going to pollinate your other plants
[13:34.620 --> 13:38.060]  with that male, but if you've got neighbors in that area, in that
[13:38.060 --> 13:41.740]  neighborhood within four or five miles, maybe even a little bit further, I'm not
[13:41.740 --> 13:45.060]  certain on pollen travel, but if you've got enough pollen and you've got
[13:45.060 --> 13:49.380]  neighbors that are growing, you're going to pollinate their crop as well.
[13:49.380 --> 13:53.780]  If it's hemp, if it's cannabis, your pollen will go pollinate a crop. And now
[13:53.780 --> 13:57.380]  you're going to mess up somebody else's crop. If somebody, if a hemp farmer was
[13:57.380 --> 14:00.780]  making hemp seeds, now he's got a cross with you that he didn't, he didn't want
[14:00.780 --> 14:03.980]  to collab with you. He wasn't trying to make a seed company with you. He wanted
[14:03.980 --> 14:07.580]  his cross with his males and his females. Also, his pollen probably would have
[14:07.580 --> 14:11.660]  gotten to you, so fuck him too. But now you've done pollination on other people's
[14:11.660 --> 14:15.900]  crops. You've contaminated other people's gardens that they worked hard for. They
[14:15.900 --> 14:19.620]  did the proper steps. They didn't put males out. They did the proper auditioning
[14:19.620 --> 14:23.620]  process. Now that's something that I want to segue into. You've got to be more
[14:23.620 --> 14:28.940]  careful when planting seeds outdoors. I see new growers buying seeds and putting
[14:28.940 --> 14:33.540]  them outside and just hoping for the best. That does work, but you're going to
[14:33.540 --> 14:36.300]  get male plants. You're going to get problematic plants. You're going to have
[14:36.300 --> 14:40.340]  mutants. You're going to find phenotypes that are undesirable for outside. You're
[14:40.340 --> 14:45.020]  not going to have the best that you could possibly do. The way to set yourself up
[14:45.020 --> 14:51.100]  for success is to audition your plants before you give them the big stage. Now
[14:51.100 --> 14:55.500]  what do I mean by that? I mean don't run big plants outside until you find out if
[14:55.500 --> 14:59.260]  they are male or female. Don't run big plants outside until you find out if
[14:59.260 --> 15:03.460]  they are worth a shit. Don't run big plants outside until you know if they
[15:03.460 --> 15:09.100]  are 65, 70, 80 day flowering plants. If that plant takes 120 days to flower, why
[15:09.100 --> 15:13.260]  are you going to put it outside in Colorado? Because when October comes
[15:13.260 --> 15:15.780]  around, we're going to get snow. You're going to need some sort of coverage. You're
[15:15.780 --> 15:18.460]  going to need some sort of heater. It's going to take a lot more work. You don't
[15:18.460 --> 15:22.900]  want that out here. That plant won't be done till New Year's, maybe next year. You
[15:22.900 --> 15:26.420]  don't want to fuck with that. You need something that finishes in 60, 70 days so
[15:26.420 --> 15:30.220]  we can get it around Halloween, get it indoors, get it taken care of, and start
[15:30.220 --> 15:34.900]  smoking it. Let me get back on my notes here because it felt good to get on a
[15:34.900 --> 15:39.780]  rant, but I want to stay on track here. So expect variation when you buy seeds, you
[15:39.780 --> 15:45.220]  guys. I've done rants on phenotypical variants. When you buy a seed pack, not
[15:45.220 --> 15:50.260]  all seeds will be the same. Depending on the filial generation of the seeds you
[15:50.260 --> 15:55.300]  are sold, there may be wide variation in those seeds. There could be very similar
[15:55.300 --> 15:59.980]  traits in those seeds, but there will be variation. Also, they could be males. They
[15:59.980 --> 16:04.740]  could be females. You don't know unless you bought feminized seeds. You have no
[16:04.740 --> 16:08.700]  way to be sure if you've got males or females, and even if you did buy fems, I
[16:08.700 --> 16:13.620]  make feminized seeds. I will back my product, but who knows how other people
[16:13.620 --> 16:17.100]  are making their fems. Maybe they'll herm on you. Maybe you got problematic
[16:17.100 --> 16:23.580]  seeds. Expect variation. Run your seed plants indoors. I recommend running them
[16:23.580 --> 16:30.620]  indoors. Then veg them big enough to get a clone. Then as soon as your clones
[16:30.620 --> 16:34.940]  root, flower the big plants or flower the clone. That's your option. You can talk
[16:34.940 --> 16:39.860]  about that, and then find out if you've got males or females. Find out if you've
[16:39.860 --> 16:44.460]  got plants that are worth a shit. Then when the time comes, put those good
[16:44.460 --> 16:48.460]  plants outdoors. A lot of people jumped the gun. A lot of people jumped the shark.
[16:48.460 --> 16:51.660]  A lot of people fucking fucked the goat. They just bought seeds and put them
[16:51.660 --> 16:55.980]  outside. I see people who spent a lot of money on building nice outdoor grow
[16:55.980 --> 17:00.060]  setups. They amended a lot of really nice soil. They did a lot of great shit, but
[17:00.060 --> 17:04.180]  they failed to select proper seeds or plants to put outdoors, and they've
[17:04.180 --> 17:08.340]  already lost more than half or more than a third of their crop because they had
[17:08.340 --> 17:12.300]  to go pull males as soon as it started getting a little bit light out a little
[17:12.300 --> 17:15.380]  bit earlier. Males started popping up. They'd wake up in the morning and go, oh
[17:15.380 --> 17:18.740]  shit, there's a male. There's a male. They're walking the rows pulling half
[17:18.740 --> 17:22.980]  their plants. So they did not prepare properly. So the way to do that is to
[17:22.980 --> 17:27.740]  audition them. Audition them before you give them the big stage. Put them in the
[17:27.740 --> 17:31.820]  little grow room. Don't have a lot of risk. Then once you've found some good
[17:31.820 --> 17:35.420]  plants, put those outdoors. Now let's get back onto the process of how to do that.
[17:35.420 --> 17:40.020]  Like I said, run your seed. Get your small plant. Grow it. As soon as you can
[17:40.020 --> 17:43.860]  get a clone, take a clone. If you're not good at taking clones, get the top out of
[17:43.860 --> 17:46.940]  the plant as a clone and the bottom two branches and leave the rest of the plant
[17:46.940 --> 17:51.540]  to grow. Take good care of that plant. Repeat that process for every seedling
[17:51.540 --> 17:55.260]  that you have popped. If you've done five seeds, do it five times. You'll have 15
[17:55.260 --> 18:00.500]  clones. If you've popped 20 seeds, do it 20 times. You'll have 60 clones. Make sure
[18:00.500 --> 18:04.140]  you've got clone space and veg space for this, and of course this is gonna require
[18:04.140 --> 18:08.140]  a room to do this in or in which to do this. Maybe one, maybe two spaces. You'll
[18:08.140 --> 18:11.460]  need to keep the original mom plant alive and you'll need to flower out
[18:11.460 --> 18:14.500]  another plant somewhere. So you're gonna need a veg space and a flower space, but
[18:14.500 --> 18:20.260]  they do not need to be big. So, veg out your seed. Get a clone. As soon as those
[18:20.260 --> 18:25.340]  clones begin to root, flower out one of, you can flower out the big plants or you
[18:25.340 --> 18:29.980]  can flower the clone. That is your choice. There are pros and cons of both of those.
[18:29.980 --> 18:34.380]  If you flower out the smaller plant that you've cut a clone of, so you cut a
[18:34.380 --> 18:39.220]  clone, you can root them as soon as, you can flower that, you can put the clone
[18:39.220 --> 18:44.100]  dome under 12-12. You can put your cloning machine under 12-12 lighting and
[18:44.100 --> 18:48.860]  within 14 days those clones will show you what are males and females. If you
[18:48.860 --> 18:52.880]  don't want to do it that way, cut your clones, let them root. As soon as they
[18:52.880 --> 18:56.820]  root, you can either flower, I would flower the big plants. They're already grown,
[18:56.820 --> 18:59.960]  they're large, they're ready to go. You can actually have a productive crop from
[18:59.960 --> 19:02.960]  that. You'll see what your phenotypes look like. You'll see what you've got
[19:02.960 --> 19:06.560]  male and female wise and you'll find the phenotype that you want to put outdoors
[19:06.560 --> 19:10.880]  and then you've got clones in the clone dome as a backup. So, after you flowered
[19:10.880 --> 19:15.040]  that, you found the champion, you've taken your clone, potted that into another pot.
[19:15.040 --> 19:19.600]  You've got them labeled clone A, plant A, clone B, plant B. Then you select your
[19:19.600 --> 19:22.640]  keeper. Then when it comes time to put them outside, you put the good one
[19:22.640 --> 19:26.920]  outside, not just the whole pack and hope for the best. You put 10 clones of your
[19:26.920 --> 19:30.080]  favorite plant out there. So, let me catch up because I feel like I've gotten ahead
[19:30.080 --> 19:34.960]  of myself. You've got the option. When you take clones and you're going to pick
[19:34.960 --> 19:39.340]  which one to flower, you can flower out that big plant or you can flower out the
[19:39.340 --> 19:44.040]  clone. The pros and cons. The pros of flowering out the big plant, it's already
[19:44.040 --> 19:47.680]  there. It's a big plant. It's fucking ready to flower. If you've got a flowering
[19:47.680 --> 19:51.600]  space, run it, turn it and burn it, flip it. Let's find out what we've got. Take
[19:51.600 --> 19:55.340]  notes, take pictures, see which keeper, which phenotype is the keeper for you
[19:55.340 --> 19:59.020]  and keep that fucker around. You got a clone of it, grow that clone out. Maybe
[19:59.020 --> 20:02.780]  you took three clones. You got one you can mom out. You can flower one.
[20:02.780 --> 20:05.780]  You can play with another one. You can keep one as a mom or you can use them
[20:05.780 --> 20:09.740]  both and make a bunch of clones. You've got options, hopefully. So, the pros of
[20:09.740 --> 20:14.020]  flowering the big one is you've got a big one. The pros of flowering the small
[20:14.020 --> 20:17.180]  one is it doesn't take a lot of space. It's a little tiny plant. You can do that
[20:17.180 --> 20:22.980]  in a very small environment. You can run 48 cups, little tiny cups and just get
[20:22.980 --> 20:27.500]  little tiny plants. You can run 48 of those under one small light in very
[20:27.500 --> 20:31.100]  small space if you keep them watered properly and pay good attention to them.
[20:31.100 --> 20:35.380]  If you can also keep that many clones alive in another space to have backups.
[20:35.380 --> 20:40.940]  So, grow your plant, get a clone, flower out either that big plant or the clone.
[20:40.940 --> 20:44.260]  Find out which one you've got. Keep one or the other around so you've got a
[20:44.260 --> 20:48.140]  backup. That is your new mom, that's your clone preservation. Select your keeper,
[20:48.500 --> 20:53.580]  then put the keeper outdoors when the time is right. So now, you've got, you've
[20:53.580 --> 20:57.340]  ran it one time, you've got your keeper, now you can put it outdoors when the time
[20:57.340 --> 21:00.140]  is right and you know that you're gonna have a quality plant. Make sure you get a
[21:00.140 --> 21:04.020]  clone before you put it outdoors. Always make sure you have a clone before you
[21:04.020 --> 21:07.940]  flower. Make sure you've got a rooted clone before you put the next plant into
[21:07.940 --> 21:11.380]  flower. Always have that clone as preservation or you may lose your
[21:11.380 --> 21:14.900]  genetics. You may have to do a reveg which is a whole new podcast. Alright, so
[21:14.900 --> 21:18.180]  a lot of your decision based on if you want to flower that big plant or that
[21:18.180 --> 21:22.820]  little plant may be based on space. If you don't have a lot of space, flower out.
[21:22.820 --> 21:26.300]  Well, depends on where your keeper, if you have a lot of veg space, keep the big
[21:26.300 --> 21:29.500]  plants. If you don't have a lot of veg space, keep the little plants. If you got
[21:29.500 --> 21:32.740]  a lot of flower space, flower the big ones. If you have a little flower space,
[21:32.740 --> 21:36.780]  flower the small ones. That is your decision to make. Flower one side, keep
[21:36.780 --> 21:41.500]  the others. Then, select your favorite one and you can toss all of the other plants
[21:41.500 --> 21:44.420]  if you want to or just grow them one more time since you've already got them.
[21:44.420 --> 21:48.300]  Flower them out, get some product off of them or just toss them. Make sure you keep a
[21:48.300 --> 21:52.020]  clone of your favorite keeper all the time. I like to take a clone of that one,
[21:52.020 --> 21:56.580]  label it fucking plant number 25, keeper. And then you've got that keeper in the
[21:56.580 --> 21:59.660]  corner all the time. That is your new mom plant. Anytime you want to grow that, you
[21:59.660 --> 22:03.060]  can go get clones of her. You can run it indoors, run it outdoors. You can breed to
[22:03.060 --> 22:06.780]  it. You can share it with friends. Develop a relationship with that clone. Learn how
[22:06.780 --> 22:11.260]  much cow maggot wants. Learn exactly how long it takes to flower. Learn if it likes
[22:11.380 --> 22:15.380]  it cold. Learn if it likes it hot. Dial it in. Develop a relationship with that
[22:15.380 --> 22:21.420]  one cultivar. So, veg. Get a clone. Then, flower. I'm trying to catch myself up on
[22:21.420 --> 22:26.380]  notes. I took too many excessive notes. Now, when you were doing the pheno hunt,
[22:26.380 --> 22:32.300]  when you were running these tester plants, do the same thing to all of them.
[22:32.300 --> 22:36.100]  Don't do any weird shit to one plant that you don't do to the other plant.
[22:36.660 --> 22:41.420]  This is a selection process. We want to know, we want to treat them all equal so
[22:41.420 --> 22:45.260]  we know which one we want to keep. If you do something weird to plant A and you
[22:45.260 --> 22:49.620]  don't do it to plant B, how do you know which one of them is going to do better
[22:49.620 --> 22:53.660]  under different circumstances? You've got to do the same thing. And the way I like
[22:53.660 --> 22:57.380]  to do a pheno hunt, people ask me, do you top them? Do you do this? I like to run
[22:57.380 --> 23:02.460]  them small and fast. Just, there's no reason to grow up. These are, excuse me,
[23:02.580 --> 23:05.940]  these are brand new seeds. We're not trying to make production off the first
[23:05.940 --> 23:11.300]  run. Your first run is not production. Your first run is for selection. Then,
[23:11.300 --> 23:15.260]  off of those selections, we will run a profitable production run. I'm going to
[23:15.260 --> 23:18.580]  clear my throat. You guys hang on for one second. All right. So, we'll pop a pack
[23:18.580 --> 23:21.740]  of seeds. That's fun to say. Say that really quickly. And then, grow them all
[23:21.740 --> 23:25.860]  really quickly. Get your clone. Flower something out as quickly as possible and
[23:25.860 --> 23:29.780]  find out if it's worth a shit to keep growing. Find out which is your keeper.
[23:29.780 --> 23:33.660]  And eliminate your boys. That way, you don't waste a bunch of time and space.
[23:33.660 --> 23:38.180]  Find out now instead of outside in August after you've been vegging since
[23:38.180 --> 23:43.460]  April. So, audition your plants. Think of it like a pack of baseball cards. You
[23:43.460 --> 23:47.620]  want to find that Mickey Mantle or think of it like magic cards. You got to find
[23:47.620 --> 23:50.860]  that whichever one you're looking for. That rare card you're looking for. But
[23:50.860 --> 23:55.020]  also, keep in mind, you may have to go through a bunch of land cards to get to
[23:55.020 --> 24:00.180]  the cards that you're looking for. So, don't put untested plants outdoors is my
[24:00.180 --> 24:06.220]  main advice unless they are feminized seeds from a reputable breeder. Also,
[24:06.220 --> 24:10.300]  autos are cool if they are fems. I'm not an auto flower guy but I should add in
[24:10.300 --> 24:14.980]  there that auto flowers are cool for outdoors if they are fems. Now, if you're
[24:14.980 --> 24:18.540]  an experienced grower and you want to fuck around and put some seeds outside
[24:18.540 --> 24:22.460]  and risk running males and you know what you're doing, you understand the risk, you
[24:22.460 --> 24:26.340]  know how to plant extra plants to cover up for the loss. If you feel like you've
[24:26.340 --> 24:29.620]  got the experience and you can identify the male plants before they become
[24:29.620 --> 24:33.100]  problematic in your garden, before they pollinate your garden or somebody else's
[24:33.100 --> 24:36.260]  garden, if you feel like that's something you can be responsible for and you're
[24:36.260 --> 24:39.860]  experienced enough to do that, go for it. But what I'm talking about are the
[24:39.860 --> 24:43.340]  people that were very unprepared and didn't realize they were going to get
[24:43.340 --> 24:46.980]  male plants outdoors this year. People that didn't realize they were gonna get
[24:46.980 --> 24:51.380]  20 foot tall plants outdoors this year when their privacy fence was only 6 feet
[24:51.380 --> 24:55.140]  tall. That's why I'm talking about audition your plants, do that pheno hunt
[24:55.140 --> 25:00.580]  and find the appropriate keeper for your situation before you put it outdoors. Now
[25:00.580 --> 25:03.820]  I know that may not be feasible for a lot of people but if you're not able to
[25:03.820 --> 25:07.020]  do that, you've got to take into consideration that you're going to get
[25:07.020 --> 25:10.660]  different plants. You're gonna get males, you're gonna get different phenotypes,
[25:10.660 --> 25:14.380]  they're not all gonna be uniform, be prepared for that. Alright, one more
[25:14.380 --> 25:17.580]  thing I want to talk about that I've seen on social media frequently is that
[25:17.580 --> 25:23.180]  a lot of people got way overzealous and put their plants outside way too early.
[25:23.180 --> 25:26.740]  Their plants went from a grow room where they were vegging, then they put them
[25:26.740 --> 25:29.900]  outside and I don't know if it was because they went from that grow light
[25:29.900 --> 25:34.300]  schedule to outside and the light was just right or just wrong and the plants
[25:34.300 --> 25:38.500]  went into flower but a lot of people put their plants out too early, they began to
[25:38.500 --> 25:44.140]  go into flower, then the season changed and the plants begin to revege and
[25:44.140 --> 25:48.500]  people started freaking out, what is happening? Then the plants went back into
[25:48.500 --> 25:51.740]  flower, now we are approaching August, the plants are beginning to flower again.
[25:51.740 --> 25:55.700]  A lot of people have some really weird looking plants, when plants begin to
[25:55.700 --> 25:59.500]  revege, they start making extra shoots, the leaves start doing weird shit. I've
[25:59.500 --> 26:03.540]  seen it on social media quite a bit, people put their plants out as soon as
[26:03.540 --> 26:08.100]  it started looking warm. People started putting their plants out as soon as it
[26:08.100 --> 26:12.340]  started looking like it was warm outside. In some places that's acceptable but the
[26:12.380 --> 26:16.700]  plants went into flower a little bit early. Those folks faced a revege
[26:16.700 --> 26:21.300]  situation and their plants look really stressed out. There are a few things
[26:21.300 --> 26:25.180]  that could have caused the early flowering. The plants came from indoor
[26:25.180 --> 26:28.940]  conditions to outdoor conditions and they just weren't sure what you expected
[26:28.940 --> 26:33.380]  from it, so it went into flower. It's like I've been inside under 20 hours of
[26:33.380 --> 26:37.780]  light or 24 hours of light or 18-6, now am I hearing the sunshine? It's kind
[26:37.780 --> 26:42.020]  of weird and I'm not sure what to do and since I'm a plant and my only goal is to
[26:42.060 --> 26:46.660]  reproduce and I'm kind of freaked out, watch me flower, here I go and so it just
[26:46.660 --> 26:51.620]  went into flower. Also, sometimes the light cycle outside was just right or
[26:51.620 --> 26:55.620]  just different enough from the indoor light cycle that it triggered the plant
[26:55.620 --> 27:01.100]  to flower. So if you came from that 18-6 or that 24 and you went outside and
[27:01.100 --> 27:04.940]  there was only 14 hours of light or 12 hours of light, it was like, hey that's
[27:04.940 --> 27:08.420]  enough. I was in there and veg, I think they just moved me to a flower room so
[27:08.420 --> 27:12.340]  it went into flower. So it just freaks out and it goes into flower. Then it went
[27:12.340 --> 27:15.940]  back into veg because the outside light, it finally realized, you know what, this
[27:15.940 --> 27:20.140]  outside lights up for a long time, maybe I should go back into veg. You guys are
[27:20.140 --> 27:23.900]  just kind of freaking your plants out a little bit and then it just, you can tell
[27:23.900 --> 27:27.820]  that it's gonna freak out the whole time. So what will happen is people assumed
[27:27.820 --> 27:32.380]  that because they saw more than 12 hours of light outside that the plants would
[27:32.380 --> 27:37.580]  stay in veg, but outside is a little bit of a different game because of the sun.
[27:37.980 --> 27:42.260]  We did, it did appear that there was more than 12 hours of light. It looked
[27:42.260 --> 27:48.180]  like there was 14 or 15 hours of light outside, but as the sun begins to set, it
[27:48.180 --> 27:52.820]  puts off, I don't understand exactly, I'm not gonna use the right terms and people
[27:52.820 --> 27:56.420]  are gonna call me on that, but let me just do it for you. As the sun set, it
[27:56.420 --> 28:03.820]  creates a red spectrum in the sky. That red spectrum triggers, it is a far red
[28:03.980 --> 28:08.580]  light and that far red triggers phytochrome in the plants and that
[28:08.580 --> 28:13.260]  phytochrome tells the plants, hey, it's time to go to sleep. So as the sun sets,
[28:13.260 --> 28:17.300]  it creates a red spectrum. That red spectrum tells the plants that it is
[28:17.300 --> 28:22.020]  sleepy time. They start sleeping, even though we still see sunlight with our
[28:22.020 --> 28:27.060]  eyes, the sunlight is still up, that red spectrum is so powerful to the plants,
[28:27.060 --> 28:31.020]  it's like hypnotic. It was like sleep and they just went, okay, and they went to
[28:31.020 --> 28:35.740]  sleep. Then as the sun rises, it puts off a blue spectrum that is basically the
[28:35.740 --> 28:39.340]  finger snap. When I snap my fingers, you'll be plants again and then they
[28:39.340 --> 28:43.300]  wake up and they start going, oh, good morning. So that red puts them to sleep,
[28:43.300 --> 28:47.660]  that blue wakes them up. It did appear that there was enough sunlight, enough
[28:47.660 --> 28:52.300]  hours of daylight outside to keep the plants awake, but wherever you were, your
[28:52.300 --> 28:55.980]  situation, your part of the equator, your part of the globe, the part of the sun,
[28:56.100 --> 29:01.380]  your environment, that environment told those plants, hey, the red wants you to go
[29:01.380 --> 29:04.860]  to sleep, you've only had this many hours in the day, and so that will trigger
[29:04.860 --> 29:10.220]  plants to go into flower. Also, plants have what is known as a critical
[29:10.220 --> 29:14.100]  period. That critical period is the amount of darkness that triggers the
[29:14.100 --> 29:18.620]  plants to go into flower. That can vary from plant to plant. The reason we do 12-12
[29:18.620 --> 29:21.940]  in a commercial grow or in a grow environment, the home grow environment, is
[29:21.940 --> 29:25.820]  because that is the cycle that we have learned that triggers nearly every
[29:25.820 --> 29:30.380]  plant. Some plants may go with a shorter dark cycle, some may take a little
[29:30.380 --> 29:33.500]  longer, like some of those sativas, they could use a darker cycle. That's why I
[29:33.500 --> 29:38.340]  recommend 11-13 on some strains later in flower, it speeds them up. But 12-12 is
[29:38.340 --> 29:42.540]  just what we have established as growers. Also, it's what we've bred towards, it's
[29:42.540 --> 29:45.300]  what we've been playing with in our gardens, it's what all of our lights have
[29:45.300 --> 29:49.780]  been set to for years, so it's what we've bred it for. But there are some cultivars,
[29:49.780 --> 29:54.300]  some phenotypes, that their critical period may be 14 hours of daylight and
[29:54.380 --> 29:57.420]  they will begin to flower. It just depends on what part of the equator, what
[29:57.420 --> 30:02.900]  part of the planet that seed and its genetics did come from. So that is why a
[30:02.900 --> 30:06.900]  lot of people's plants went into flower too early, that's why people's plants
[30:06.900 --> 30:11.260]  started to reveg, they started spitting out weird-shaped leaves, they started
[30:11.260 --> 30:15.740]  making weird shoots, they started to show pistils, and then they reveged. And people
[30:15.740 --> 30:19.380]  like, are these herming on me? No, they were not going herm on you, they were not
[30:19.380 --> 30:24.780]  hermaphrodites, they were reveging. Then they got back into their normal, we're
[30:24.780 --> 30:28.980]  reveging, we're back into veg, cool. And then nature went, oh but wait, it's flower
[30:28.980 --> 30:32.700]  season now. And the light cycle actually started reducing and now the plants went
[30:32.700 --> 30:35.540]  back into flower. I don't know if the video just saw me push the mic out of my
[30:35.540 --> 30:38.780]  face on accident. Then the plants went into flower, they look kind of crazy,
[30:38.780 --> 30:42.780]  those are gonna be struggle plants the whole way through. So let me catch up on
[30:42.780 --> 30:45.580]  my notes because I did make a lot of notes and I just skipped over a lot of
[30:45.580 --> 30:49.060]  them. I got ranting and I enjoyed that more than following the notes. So because
[30:49.060 --> 30:52.940]  of this phytochrome red, because of the far red spectrum, that is what is causing
[30:52.940 --> 30:57.340]  the plants to trigger their flowering cycle a little bit earlier than we
[30:57.340 --> 31:01.020]  anticipated. We did see that light was 14 hours, it looked, we looked at the
[31:01.020 --> 31:05.420]  farmer's almanac, it said sunrise and sunset, we had 16, 14, maybe 13 hours in
[31:05.420 --> 31:09.860]  there. Why are the plants flowering? Because of their critical period, because
[31:09.860 --> 31:14.300]  of far red light, and because of phytochrome red. Alright, so I think that
[31:14.300 --> 31:19.740]  kind of answered my own question to my own rant. Please don't put untested
[31:19.740 --> 31:24.460]  seeds outside unless you are able to identify and cull male plants before
[31:24.460 --> 31:29.020]  they become problematic. Maybe if you're using fem seeds, that is cool, you don't
[31:29.020 --> 31:33.580]  have to test those. Still keep an eye on them. Fem seeds can be problematic. I do
[31:33.580 --> 31:38.020]  make fems, I don't get reports of problems in mine, but I do see problems
[31:38.020 --> 31:41.220]  in fem seeds. It depends on how they are made, it depends on how the parents are
[31:41.220 --> 31:46.020]  selected, you may find problems. Also I said it before, auto flowers are cool
[31:46.020 --> 31:49.740]  outside, if that's your thing, do it. If you're gonna run fems, I recommend that.
[31:49.740 --> 31:53.860]  Again, if you're gonna do autos and they're not fem, please pay attention for
[31:53.860 --> 31:57.940]  the male plants. And then my next piece of advice is be more careful when you're
[31:57.940 --> 32:01.820]  putting your plants outside, be more prepared. If you put them out too early,
[32:01.820 --> 32:07.000]  they may go into flower too early, depending on your location on the planet,
[32:07.000 --> 32:12.360]  the equator, where you are, northern, southern hemisphere, could affect your
[32:12.360 --> 32:16.360]  planting and flowering times. Alright, podcast world, if you have got any
