[00:00.000 --> 00:02.140]  Mic check, headphones, headphones, microphone.
[00:02.140 --> 00:03.140]  That sounds good.
[00:03.140 --> 00:04.140]  Let's just do this.
[00:04.140 --> 00:05.140]  Here we go.
[00:05.140 --> 00:06.140]  Welcome back, podcast world.
[00:06.140 --> 00:10.400]  It is time for episode 515 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.

[00:45.800 --> 00:49.320]  I'm sure you can tell that I'm still trying to catch my breath from the gigantic dabs
[00:49.320 --> 00:53.560]  of sour diesel BX2 full spectrum extract that I just took.
[00:53.560 --> 00:55.840]  Big shout out to my friends at Green Dot Labs.
[00:55.840 --> 01:01.280]  I am really enjoying the sour diesel BX2 full spectrum extract diamonds.
[01:01.280 --> 01:04.480]  This jar was ridiculous with big chunky diamonds.
[01:04.480 --> 01:05.660]  Let's talk about the cross here.
[01:05.660 --> 01:10.800]  On the label, this is a blend of sour diesel and sour diesel cross two headbanger.
[01:10.800 --> 01:15.040]  So this is a BX, which means they were trying to recreate the sour diesel.
[01:15.040 --> 01:16.400]  This is a BX2.
[01:16.400 --> 01:21.040]  There is not a sour diesel male available, so they had to introduce the headbanger male.
[01:21.040 --> 01:23.800]  They bred the headbanger male to the sour diesel.
[01:23.800 --> 01:27.800]  Then you find the appropriate male, then you breed that back to the sour diesel.
[01:27.800 --> 01:28.800]  That is a BX.
[01:28.800 --> 01:30.020]  There's a lot of work into that.
[01:30.020 --> 01:33.120]  That is a whole nother podcast episode, which I think I have done.
[01:33.120 --> 01:34.920]  Let's stay focused for today.
[01:34.920 --> 01:40.880]  On the package of this sour diesel BX2, it is described as floral, sweet, and pine, which
[01:40.880 --> 01:43.800]  I find to be completely accurate.
[01:43.800 --> 01:48.720]  In most cases, I do not enjoy the flavor of sour diesel concentrates.
[01:48.720 --> 01:54.720]  I don't think that that sour diesel, diesel, funky gas aroma translates well when it comes
[01:54.720 --> 01:56.440]  to diamonds and sauce.
[01:56.440 --> 01:57.600]  Something is just missing.
[01:57.600 --> 01:59.240]  I don't think it comes out properly.
[01:59.240 --> 02:00.840]  The skunk part goes away.
[02:00.840 --> 02:02.680]  It turns into weird, harsh chemicals.
[02:02.680 --> 02:04.280]  It is not my favorite.
[02:04.280 --> 02:10.920]  In this case, with the Green Dot Labs sour diesel BX2, most of that weird, chemically
[02:10.920 --> 02:12.900]  funkiness is gone.
[02:12.900 --> 02:17.000]  When you hit it, when you open the jar, you immediately smell, I immediately smell the
[02:17.000 --> 02:19.920]  floral aroma, which they're talking about.
[02:19.920 --> 02:23.880]  Then when the dabber hits the dab and starts going into your face, it gets that floral,
[02:23.880 --> 02:25.440]  sweet thing happening.
[02:25.440 --> 02:28.880]  Then on the exhale, that is where the pine coats my tongue.
[02:28.880 --> 02:31.040]  It leaves the room like floral and piney.
[02:31.040 --> 02:32.080]  I really enjoy it.
[02:32.080 --> 02:35.200]  It's like a pine air freshener with a little bit of perfume to it.
[02:35.200 --> 02:36.560]  I think it's delicious.
[02:36.560 --> 02:38.800]  I obviously am loving the buzz.
[02:38.800 --> 02:45.400]  On the back of the package, it says the product contains 75.27% THC and non-detectable amounts
[02:45.400 --> 02:46.760]  of CBD.
[02:46.800 --> 02:52.600]  Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious sour diesel BX2 full
[02:52.600 --> 02:53.600]  spectrum extract.
[02:53.600 --> 02:58.000]  All right, you guys, in this episode, I'm going to talk about one of my favorite strains
[02:58.000 --> 02:59.000]  that I have bred.
[02:59.000 --> 03:01.760]  I'm going to review the strain called Dragon Punch.
[03:01.760 --> 03:05.840]  Before we get there, let's do some shout outs to a few of the folks who support the show
[03:05.840 --> 03:07.520]  on Patreon.
[03:07.520 --> 03:11.520]  Let's roll up a big fat joint and pass that over to our buddy, Godfather Kush.
[03:11.520 --> 03:16.300]  Let's send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast high five and a blunt over to Seth's Burton.
[03:16.300 --> 03:19.420]  Let's send a big fat too hot of a dab over to Zoso J.
[03:19.420 --> 03:22.900]  I always want to send a big fat bong rip over to my buddy Cosmo.
[03:22.900 --> 03:25.140]  Let's pack up a fresh bowl for my buddy Keith K.
[03:25.140 --> 03:28.260]  I always want to roll a big fat joint for my buddy Big Toe Grows.
[03:28.260 --> 03:30.500]  I always got a dab for my buddy Fat Rabbit.
[03:30.500 --> 03:36.060]  And last but certainly not least, let's heat up a big fat gigantic dab for my buddy Willie's
[03:36.060 --> 03:37.180]  armpit.
[03:37.180 --> 03:41.540]  Big thank you, big shout out, and big respect to everybody who continues to support the
[03:41.540 --> 03:43.260]  show on Patreon.
[03:43.260 --> 03:46.380]  If you're not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,

[03:55.140 --> 03:58.180]  And of course, I did include a link in the show notes.
[03:58.180 --> 04:02.740]  All right, you guys, let's talk about one of my favorite strains that I find is often
[04:02.740 --> 04:03.740]  overlooked.
[04:03.740 --> 04:05.260]  Maybe I haven't talked about this one enough.
[04:05.260 --> 04:07.180]  Maybe I haven't posted enough photos.
[04:07.180 --> 04:12.500]  Maybe you guys just haven't discovered the magic of a strain that I call Dragon Punch.
[04:12.500 --> 04:15.780]  In the last strain review, I did a strain called Sonic Boom.
[04:15.780 --> 04:19.820]  Let's do one called Dragon Punch so you guys can kind of see where I get my naming schemes
[04:19.820 --> 04:20.820]  and my themes from.
[04:20.820 --> 04:22.940]  Yes, I am a 90s kid, an 80s kid.
[04:22.940 --> 04:23.940]  I love video games.
[04:23.940 --> 04:24.980]  I love cartoons.
[04:24.980 --> 04:25.980]  I love the Grateful Dead.
[04:25.980 --> 04:26.980]  I love reggae music.
[04:26.980 --> 04:29.340]  That is where my naming schemes come from.
[04:29.340 --> 04:31.100]  So we've done Sonic Boom last week.
[04:31.100 --> 04:34.300]  Let's do Dragon Punch this week.
[04:34.300 --> 04:35.860]  Let's talk about Dragon Punch.
[04:35.860 --> 04:42.400]  Dragon Punch is a cross of East Coast Panama Chunk Cross II TK Stardog.
[04:42.400 --> 04:44.460]  That plant did not have an official name.
[04:44.460 --> 04:45.460]  It had a name.
[04:45.460 --> 04:48.580]  We discovered that another breeder is already using that name.
[04:48.580 --> 04:51.660]  He's got a very popular line with that name on it.
[04:51.660 --> 04:55.700]  So I have stopped referring to that name altogether when it comes to this plant.
[04:55.700 --> 05:00.620]  So it is now known as East Coast Panama Chunk Cross II TK Stardog.
[05:00.620 --> 05:02.060]  Those are the genetics of the plant.
[05:02.060 --> 05:03.220]  It doesn't have a name.
[05:03.220 --> 05:04.220]  That's what it is.
[05:04.220 --> 05:05.220]  I know what it is.
[05:05.580 --> 05:06.580]  It's an awesome plant.
[05:06.580 --> 05:10.220]  East Coast Panama Chunk creates giant, giant buds.
[05:10.220 --> 05:14.700]  They are monstrous and they have this chocolatey, funky, earthy aroma to them.
[05:14.700 --> 05:21.260]  Then the TK Stardog is gassy and funky and has a really nice, fuely funk to it and grows
[05:21.260 --> 05:22.260]  really well.
[05:22.260 --> 05:24.300]  So that was a beautiful hybrid.
[05:24.300 --> 05:26.980]  That plant created gigantic plants.
[05:26.980 --> 05:29.340]  That plant created gigantic buds.
[05:29.340 --> 05:31.540]  That plant created beautiful colors.
[05:31.540 --> 05:34.620]  It would create purples and magentas and pinks and reds.
[05:35.020 --> 05:38.580]  And if you let it flower long enough, the buds would get this really dark, dark color.
[05:38.580 --> 05:40.660]  The plants were super beautiful.
[05:40.660 --> 05:45.180]  That was East Coast Panama Chunk Cross II TK Stardog.
[05:45.180 --> 05:48.980]  Then I took my prized Arise male, who is known as King Solomon.
[05:48.980 --> 05:52.820]  I'm sure if you listen to this podcast, you've heard me talk about King Solomon.
[05:52.820 --> 05:55.540]  King Solomon is a very select Arise male.
[05:55.540 --> 05:58.460]  Arise is a Golden Goat to Daybreaker hybrid.
[05:58.460 --> 06:02.620]  Golden Goat has that tropical, sweet sativa dominant characteristics.
[06:02.620 --> 06:03.620]  It's got real thin leaves.
[06:03.620 --> 06:07.500]  It tastes really tropical and it grows in about nine weeks.
[06:07.500 --> 06:09.780]  So it is a very beautiful plant to work with.
[06:09.780 --> 06:13.020]  I pollinated that with a Daybreaker male.
[06:13.020 --> 06:15.660]  Daybreaker is an Indica dominant hybrid.
[06:15.660 --> 06:18.500]  It is a cross of Chem D and Joseph OG.
[06:18.500 --> 06:23.500]  So you've got that Chem D, rotten funk, that fresh tennis ball, burnt rubber kind of a
[06:23.500 --> 06:28.020]  smell crossed to the Joseph OG, which is really funky, really fuely.
[06:28.020 --> 06:30.140]  It's got a little bit of a feet aroma to it.
[06:30.140 --> 06:34.860]  So when you cross the Golden Goat and the Daybreaker, you get a sweet, tropical, funky,
[06:34.860 --> 06:36.340]  nasty sort of a thing.
[06:36.340 --> 06:38.820]  And Arise seems to grow with hyper vigor.
[06:38.820 --> 06:40.380]  That plant grows really quickly.
[06:40.380 --> 06:44.700]  So that male that I selected passes on that hyper vigor trait.
[06:44.700 --> 06:47.140]  All of his offspring grow really quickly.
[06:47.140 --> 06:49.180]  They grow really rapidly with a lot of branching.
[06:49.180 --> 06:54.780]  So you can veg them for about a week less than many other plants in many situations.
[06:54.780 --> 06:59.700]  I have also discovered that most of the things I pollinate with King Solomon become very
[06:59.780 --> 07:00.780]  potent.
[07:00.780 --> 07:04.060]  All of his progeny are highly potent in lab tests.
[07:04.060 --> 07:08.940]  I have seen many of his offspring test in the high 20s and several of them test in the
[07:08.940 --> 07:10.100]  low 30s.
[07:10.100 --> 07:17.180]  I've got an Arise female that tests at 35.84% THCA at Steep Hill Labs.
[07:17.180 --> 07:19.380]  That is one of my favorite plants to work with.
[07:19.380 --> 07:23.060]  That shows the potential of that male plant, which I have selected.
[07:23.060 --> 07:28.620]  So I have crossed that male Arise plant to the female East Coast Panama chunk, which
[07:28.620 --> 07:31.060]  was crossed to the TK Stardog.
[07:31.060 --> 07:34.540]  If you're trying to write down the name of that plant, I would put a parenthesis and
[07:34.540 --> 07:36.620]  I would write ECPC.
[07:36.620 --> 07:38.380]  That's East Coast Panama chunk.
[07:38.380 --> 07:44.260]  Then I would put an X and that is crossed to TKSD, which is TK Stardog, which is the
[07:44.260 --> 07:47.240]  infamous triangle cush crossed to the Stardog.
[07:47.240 --> 07:53.540]  So in parentheses, you would have ECPC and then a space and then an X and then TKSD.
[07:53.540 --> 07:55.560]  And then you would close your parentheses up there.
[07:55.560 --> 07:59.280]  Then you would write another X and then you would write Arise because the female plant
[07:59.280 --> 08:02.880]  was the East Coast Panama chunk crossed to TK Stardog.
[08:02.880 --> 08:05.140]  That's all one cross that goes in parentheses.
[08:05.140 --> 08:06.140]  Then you put an X.
[08:06.140 --> 08:10.840]  The male that I introduced into that collaboration there was the Arise.
[08:10.840 --> 08:15.140]  So now knowing that pedigree, knowing that all-star lineup of genetics, we know what
[08:15.140 --> 08:17.680]  to expect a little bit from this cross.
[08:17.680 --> 08:22.040]  We've got East Coast Panama chunk, which is known for making gigantic buds that are kind
[08:22.040 --> 08:23.040]  of chocolatey.
[08:23.040 --> 08:25.040]  They have sort of a hashy sort of a smell.
[08:25.040 --> 08:29.440]  Then we've got the TK Stardog, which is known for that skunky, funky aroma and that vigorous
[08:29.440 --> 08:30.440]  growth.
[08:30.440 --> 08:33.680]  Then we've got Arise, which comes from ChemD and Joseph OG.
[08:33.680 --> 08:37.160]  So we've got more potential for even more dirty, funky aromas.
[08:37.160 --> 08:40.880]  Then we've got that Golden Goat in there to kind of give it that sativa edge so you can
[08:40.880 --> 08:43.180]  get that super head ripping high.
[08:43.180 --> 08:46.280]  This is a really interesting and a really fun hybrid.
[08:46.280 --> 08:49.800]  And when I grew it out, I got mostly what I was expecting.
[08:49.800 --> 08:53.280]  We will talk about some of the phenotypes here a little bit later in the show.
[08:53.520 --> 08:57.880]  Let's talk about the flavors and aromas that come from the Dragon Punch plant.
[08:57.880 --> 09:03.080]  My favorite aromas that come from this plant are sort of a chocolatey, earthy, sort of
[09:03.080 --> 09:06.040]  a coffee, sort of a burnt rubber sort of a smell.
[09:06.040 --> 09:08.520]  It is really funky and I really enjoy it.
[09:08.520 --> 09:12.880]  It's kind of dark chocolatey, kind of hashy, and it's got a little bit of a hint of armpits
[09:12.880 --> 09:15.360]  to it that may sound completely disgusting.
[09:15.360 --> 09:19.360]  But when it comes to cannabis, I think some of those words are the best things you can
[09:19.360 --> 09:20.960]  hear in a strain description.
[09:20.960 --> 09:24.280]  It's got funky, it's got chocolate, it's got armpits to it.
[09:24.280 --> 09:28.760]  There are a lot of really unique aromas and flavors that come from this plant.
[09:28.760 --> 09:32.560]  It is sort of like you took dark chocolate and maybe some coffee and then put a little
[09:32.560 --> 09:36.440]  bit of jet fuel inside of that cup and it is deliciously funky.
[09:36.440 --> 09:41.040]  I keep saying funky because there's just a weird funk to the Dragon Punch and I really
[09:41.040 --> 09:42.040]  love it.
[09:42.040 --> 09:47.320]  I really believe that that East Coast Panama chunk put a really nice chocolatey, earthy,
[09:47.320 --> 09:52.200]  sort of a flavor and aroma into this cross because I've also crossed the Arise to the
[09:52.200 --> 09:56.040]  Stardog and I don't get any of that coffee flavor from that cross.
[09:56.040 --> 09:58.060]  That one goes more gas and berries.
[09:58.060 --> 10:02.040]  When you put the East Coast Panama chunk in there, it really gave it like an earthy, savory
[10:02.040 --> 10:06.520]  sort of a tone, sort of a, I keep saying chocolate, but that's probably the best description I've
[10:06.520 --> 10:07.520]  got.
[10:07.520 --> 10:11.080]  Chocolate, real dark chocolate, sort of earthy, burnt coffee.
[10:11.080 --> 10:14.880]  I really love that aroma in the back end of my cannabis.
[10:14.880 --> 10:20.280]  So that is basically the flavor, chocolatey, funky, earthy, hashy, a hint of feet and maybe
[10:20.280 --> 10:22.440]  hints of fuel in some of the phenotypes.
[10:22.440 --> 10:24.440]  Now let's talk about the buzz.
[10:24.440 --> 10:27.400]  What is it like when you smoke Dragon Punch?
[10:27.400 --> 10:30.140]  There is a reason why I called it Dragon Punch.
[10:30.140 --> 10:33.440]  It is sort of like getting punched right in the face.
[10:33.440 --> 10:37.100]  When you hit Dragon Punch a couple of times, you kind of just want to chill out.
[10:37.100 --> 10:41.880]  It feels like your body is super stoned, like your body just sucks into the couch.
[10:41.880 --> 10:44.560]  It's like, oh, I might be stuck here for a minute.
[10:44.560 --> 10:49.040]  But also your brain starts going so fast that you really wish you could get up and do some
[10:49.040 --> 10:52.480]  shit, but you're just like, no, I'm probably just going to sit here.
[10:52.480 --> 10:56.560]  If you've got a guitar in your hand or if you've got a PlayStation or an Xbox controller
[10:56.560 --> 10:59.220]  in your hand, you're probably in the fucking zone.
[10:59.220 --> 11:03.200]  If you're a songwriter, if you're an artist, if you're a musician or something like that,
[11:03.200 --> 11:07.240]  this is the perfect kind of herb that I'm a podcaster, I'm a musician, I do all kinds
[11:07.240 --> 11:09.520]  of random creativity sort of things.
[11:09.520 --> 11:13.560]  This is the kind of stuff that when I smoke it, I just want to sit here and be creative.
[11:13.560 --> 11:14.920]  I don't want to be around other people.
[11:14.920 --> 11:17.400]  I don't need any other sort of inputs or anything.
[11:17.400 --> 11:19.440]  I just want to entertain myself.
[11:19.440 --> 11:23.640]  My creativity just starts going crazy when I smoke the Dragon Punch.
[11:23.640 --> 11:25.720]  So it makes my body just done.
[11:25.720 --> 11:27.240]  I just want to sit here and chill out.
[11:27.240 --> 11:30.560]  But my brain is like, okay, let's do all of the things.
[11:30.560 --> 11:33.100]  So it's really nice, creative herb for me.
[11:33.100 --> 11:37.400]  I think it works great to play the guitar, maybe play some video games, maybe write some
[11:37.400 --> 11:40.360]  stuff down for a podcast and get a creative flow going.
[11:40.360 --> 11:43.160]  I think it's really good herb for my brain.
[11:43.160 --> 11:46.960]  I also find that it's super good for lower back pain.
[11:46.960 --> 11:48.480]  I'm a six foot five guy.
[11:48.480 --> 11:52.360]  I try not to complain too much about my body aches and pains because we're all humans.
[11:52.360 --> 11:54.580]  We all got aches and pains and all that bullshit.
[11:54.580 --> 11:58.280]  But sometimes my lower back fucking sucks.
[11:58.280 --> 11:59.520]  I don't talk about it a lot.
[11:59.520 --> 12:00.520]  Nobody cares.
[12:00.520 --> 12:02.900]  All I got to do is take a dab of Dragon Punch and guess what?
[12:02.900 --> 12:04.160]  No more lower back pain.
[12:04.160 --> 12:06.020]  It makes it just go away.
[12:06.020 --> 12:09.740]  And one thing that I almost forgot to mention, I noticed that when I smoke Dragon Punch,
[12:09.740 --> 12:14.060]  if I smoke it before bedtime to ease that back pain, to kind of chill myself out, I
[12:14.060 --> 12:16.180]  have amazing dreams.
[12:16.180 --> 12:17.980]  I already have pretty intense dreams.
[12:17.980 --> 12:22.300]  I can kind of control my dreams a little bit, but I feel when I smoke that Dragon Punch,
[12:22.300 --> 12:26.460]  I've got a lot more control of my dreams and they are very intense.
[12:26.460 --> 12:30.260]  I feel like if I try to play around too much in my dreams, like if I'm doing something
[12:30.260 --> 12:33.580]  and I realize, oh bro, you're dreaming and you've got control of this.
[12:33.580 --> 12:37.700]  Sometimes I can manipulate the dreams, but if I do too much, I'll wake myself up.
[12:37.700 --> 12:41.980]  I feel like when I smoke Dragon Punch, I can really dance around in that dream realm and
[12:41.980 --> 12:46.180]  I don't wake myself up as easily and snap myself out of whatever crazy situation I've
[12:46.180 --> 12:48.060]  gotten myself into in dreamland.
[12:48.060 --> 12:50.220]  So it gives me incredible dreams.
[12:50.220 --> 12:54.420]  It helps to relieve the pain and it just makes me super creative.
[12:54.420 --> 12:58.580]  My goal when I bred this plant was to get some of that chocolate flavor and some of
[12:58.580 --> 13:04.220]  those purple and magenta colors into that Arise Cross, but also bring that Arise potency
[13:04.220 --> 13:07.500]  into the cross, bring that Arise vigor into the cross.
[13:07.500 --> 13:13.980]  The East Coast Panama Chunk TK Stardog plant was already a crazy vigorous grower, but sometimes
[13:13.980 --> 13:17.740]  it didn't make the biggest, chunkiest buds if the room was not perfect.
[13:17.740 --> 13:19.820]  It was kind of a finicky picky plant.
[13:19.820 --> 13:23.060]  I know that King Solomon puts crazy vigor into plants.
[13:23.060 --> 13:25.420]  I know it puts crazy potency into plants.
[13:25.420 --> 13:30.940]  So my idea was to cross the King Solomon to the East Coast Panama Chunk TK Stardog
[13:30.940 --> 13:36.740]  cross to kind of increase the vigor and fix that finickiness that plant originally had.
[13:36.740 --> 13:39.980]  We would grow the shit out of most of the plants in the grow and this one would be like,
[13:39.980 --> 13:42.500]  yeah, I'm cool, but I could have done better.
[13:42.500 --> 13:46.340]  And I knew there was more potential in that plant, but in a commercial environment, you
[13:46.340 --> 13:49.060]  cannot adjust the entire room for one plant.
[13:49.060 --> 13:52.760]  If seven out of 10 plants are thriving and three of them are kind of going, eh, you leave
[13:52.760 --> 13:57.320]  it just like it is so that 70% of your room is killing it and you adjust and don't run
[13:57.320 --> 14:00.900]  those three next time you run those in a different room and fix that.
[14:00.900 --> 14:02.160]  But I knew I could fix it.
[14:02.160 --> 14:07.540]  So I bred it to the arise and it came out very close to what I was hoping for.
[14:07.540 --> 14:11.200]  The only thing I see from this cross that I was really not hoping for, I kind of hope
[14:11.200 --> 14:15.840]  didn't happen, is some of the plants are extremely tall.
[14:15.840 --> 14:18.800]  There are very, very tall phenotypes.
[14:18.800 --> 14:21.320]  There's a phenotype that I call the tall stretchy girl.
[14:21.320 --> 14:23.840]  It looks like you're growing a fucking fishing pole.
[14:23.840 --> 14:28.800]  It will make one giant six foot tall cola right up the middle and it doesn't give you
[14:28.800 --> 14:30.680]  a lot of side branching.
[14:30.680 --> 14:35.480]  That's a really cool fucking trait that is also a serious pain in the ass trait for a
[14:35.480 --> 14:36.480]  plant.
[14:36.480 --> 14:39.120]  If you're growing in an indoor tent and you've got three or four of these in a room and you're
[14:39.120 --> 14:43.000]  thinking you're going to get some five foot tall plants with some branching, maybe not
[14:43.000 --> 14:47.120]  because sometimes this one phenotype just doesn't make much branching and it shoots
[14:47.120 --> 14:50.520]  one six foot tall cola right out of the middle of the plant.
[14:50.720 --> 14:54.560]  If you're in a tent, you're fucking screwed because those tents are only six feet tall,
[14:54.560 --> 14:55.880]  maybe seven feet tall.
[14:55.880 --> 14:56.880]  You're touching the light.
[14:56.880 --> 14:58.660]  You've got to do some manipulation.
[14:58.660 --> 15:00.640]  That is the downside to this plant.
[15:00.640 --> 15:06.200]  Keep in mind that that is only one phenotype and also outdoors in the right environment,
[15:06.200 --> 15:08.360]  that plant would be fucking awesome.
[15:08.360 --> 15:12.380]  As an honest and open breeder who likes to have a very open conversation with my friends
[15:12.380 --> 15:16.600]  and the people who buy my seeds and my supporters, I'm going to tell you there is a phenotype
[15:16.600 --> 15:19.120]  in this pack of seeds that is a real bitch.
[15:19.120 --> 15:21.080]  It gets way too tall.
[15:21.080 --> 15:25.360]  But if you're growing outdoors or in a tall greenhouse, that thing could be fucking the
[15:25.360 --> 15:28.720]  super cash cropper for you because there's not much trimming.
[15:28.720 --> 15:30.400]  It just makes giant fan leaves.
[15:30.400 --> 15:32.240]  It doesn't make a lot of little sugar leaf.
[15:32.240 --> 15:36.080]  So you just clip off those giant fan leaves and you've got six foot long baseball bat
[15:36.080 --> 15:37.080]  colas.
[15:37.080 --> 15:38.800]  They look super good on social media.
[15:38.800 --> 15:41.800]  They're really good advertising for you and for myself.
[15:41.800 --> 15:45.220]  It'll work beautifully if that's what you're trying to do, but be prepared.
[15:45.220 --> 15:49.740]  If you've got a phenotype that starts getting really tall on you really quickly, most people
[15:49.740 --> 15:51.580]  assume that one's going to be a male.
[15:51.580 --> 15:54.900]  I've assumed that when most plants take off, I go, that's going to be my boy and I just
[15:54.900 --> 15:57.900]  start paying attention and I know he's probably the first to go.
[15:57.900 --> 15:58.900]  You may not have that.
[15:58.900 --> 16:02.300]  You may have the fishing pole phenotype that gets really big.
[16:02.300 --> 16:07.020]  So as a reliable breeder who tries to be honest and open, I'm going to tell you that one may
[16:07.020 --> 16:08.940]  be problematic for a lot of people.
[16:08.940 --> 16:14.700]  And honest, I did not predict, foresee, anticipate or expect that plant from my breeding project.
[16:14.700 --> 16:16.020]  I don't know where that comes from.
[16:16.020 --> 16:19.300]  I don't know which plants make that happen in this cross.
[16:19.300 --> 16:23.540]  I'm assuming it's something in the East Coast Panama chunk because I've played with all
[16:23.540 --> 16:27.740]  of the other plants before in different combinations and I've never gotten this.
[16:27.740 --> 16:33.020]  So there is an East Coast Panama chunk trait that is making just one six foot tall giant
[16:33.020 --> 16:35.340]  donkey dick baseball bat bud in there.
[16:35.340 --> 16:37.500]  If you get that one, send me pictures.
[16:37.500 --> 16:40.340]  Let me know what you think, if it works for you or if it doesn't.
[16:40.340 --> 16:41.420]  Now you know what to expect.
[16:41.420 --> 16:43.060]  I've just got to admit that it's there.
[16:43.060 --> 16:44.740]  As a breeder, I didn't know that was coming.
[16:44.740 --> 16:46.860]  It was kind of a big surprise.
[16:46.860 --> 16:48.820]  Also a very neat surprise to go, what's with this one?
[16:48.820 --> 16:50.540]  It's not making much branching.
[16:50.540 --> 16:53.860]  It just made, the plant was like three feet tall and it had like four or five little tiny
[16:53.860 --> 16:55.540]  side branches off of it.
[16:55.540 --> 16:58.620]  And then I took two of them off to make clones and then that fucker took off.
[16:58.620 --> 17:00.340]  Six feet tall, it was ridiculous.
[17:00.340 --> 17:02.380]  All right, I'm off on a rant on that.
[17:02.380 --> 17:05.980]  But the downside to this cross is you will get tall plants.
[17:05.980 --> 17:11.700]  The upside to this cross is for outdoor growing, you may get some gigantic fucking plants.
[17:11.740 --> 17:13.980]  They will be very colorful plants.
[17:13.980 --> 17:17.580]  Most of these phenotypes produce really dark green leaves.
[17:17.580 --> 17:20.820]  You find really beautiful fall colors toward the end of flower.
[17:20.820 --> 17:24.700]  I've seen reds and pinks and magentas and oranges and golds.
[17:24.700 --> 17:28.260]  The leaves look like flames and fire with purple on the tips.
[17:28.260 --> 17:33.340]  These plants make gorgeous, gorgeous colors at the end of the flowering phase.
[17:33.340 --> 17:38.020]  Also I have noticed that if you lower the pH and also get it kind of cold, you will
[17:38.020 --> 17:41.820]  see a lot of beautiful, beautiful colors.
[17:41.820 --> 17:44.740]  Now let's talk a little bit about feeding dragon punch.
[17:44.740 --> 17:46.500]  Dragon punch makes giant buds.
[17:46.500 --> 17:48.780]  Dragon punch is a fast growing plant.
[17:48.780 --> 17:51.740]  Dragon punch is going to eat a lot of nutrients.
[17:51.740 --> 17:55.100]  She will also like an excessive amount of cow mag.
[17:55.100 --> 18:00.380]  I've noticed that some of the broader leafed phenotypes like a lot of cow mag.
[18:00.380 --> 18:02.980]  She also prefers lower pH.
[18:02.980 --> 18:07.140]  If you can get the pH a little bit lower than most plants, I feel like the dragon punch
[18:07.260 --> 18:13.100]  will appreciate life a little bit better and she will also make those beautiful fall colors.
[18:13.100 --> 18:18.260]  She is very resistant to all temperature swings from what I have noticed.
[18:18.260 --> 18:19.520]  She does well in hot.
[18:19.520 --> 18:20.980]  She does well in cold.
[18:20.980 --> 18:23.820]  She'll do wonderfully in a dialed in environment.
[18:23.820 --> 18:26.620]  She also responds very well to kelp products.
[18:26.620 --> 18:30.740]  I feel like some kelp products, something like liquid karma or something in that realm
[18:30.740 --> 18:35.940]  will bring out that stank and that flavor and aroma also helps bring out those beautiful
[18:35.980 --> 18:37.780]  fall colors.
[18:37.780 --> 18:42.100]  I generally recommend that you lollipop and pop and twist and trellis all of the plants
[18:42.100 --> 18:43.100]  that I breed.
[18:43.100 --> 18:48.700]  I have noticed that sometimes the dragon punch does not respond well to popping and twisting.
[18:48.700 --> 18:51.760]  Some of the phenotypes will create really purple stems.
[18:51.760 --> 18:53.740]  Those plants do not like to be twisted.
[18:53.740 --> 18:55.380]  They do not like the popping.
[18:55.380 --> 18:57.340]  That may be a nutrient deficiency.
[18:57.340 --> 19:00.540]  I think it is genetic because I've seen it in several phenotypes.
[19:00.540 --> 19:01.760]  We've tried to correct it.
[19:01.760 --> 19:02.760]  It stays purple.
[19:02.760 --> 19:04.720]  I think it is a genetic expression.
[19:04.720 --> 19:07.400]  Those purple stems do not want to be popped and twisted.
[19:07.400 --> 19:08.400]  They're brittle.
[19:08.400 --> 19:09.400]  They're finicky.
[19:09.400 --> 19:10.860]  They're not into it.
[19:10.860 --> 19:13.260]  Sometimes this plant does not react well to trellising.
[19:13.260 --> 19:17.720]  That finicky, woody type of stem sometimes makes them want to break when you're trying
[19:17.720 --> 19:19.100]  to trellis it down.
[19:19.100 --> 19:24.500]  I have noticed if you feed them well in veg and you keep them young and lush, they don't
[19:24.500 --> 19:28.320]  get as woody and you can manipulate and bend and twist them.
[19:28.320 --> 19:32.700]  When you put them into flower and they start freaking out a little bit making that transition,
[19:32.700 --> 19:35.080]  they will get a little bit stiff and woody on you.
[19:35.080 --> 19:38.800]  They get a little bit stubborn for bending and manipulating at this time.
[19:38.800 --> 19:42.080]  If you can get all of your training, all of your popping, all of your twisting, all of
[19:42.080 --> 19:46.760]  your trellising down before all of the plants get into that flowering phase and begin to
[19:46.760 --> 19:50.680]  get woody, the plants will be happy and they will continue to grow.
[19:50.680 --> 19:54.560]  But you will notice that later in flower, those plants will start to get purple and
[19:54.560 --> 19:56.180]  they'll start to get woody.
[19:56.180 --> 19:57.180]  Don't bend them.
[19:57.180 --> 20:00.760]  Don't treat them too roughly because some of those phenotypes will get a little bit
[20:00.760 --> 20:01.760]  delicate.
[20:01.820 --> 20:05.980]  Now this plant is one of my more challenging plants to grow.
[20:05.980 --> 20:08.220]  This may not be the best plant for beginners.
[20:08.220 --> 20:10.680]  This is more of an experienced grower plant.
[20:10.680 --> 20:16.480]  It is not the easiest to grow because of that non-flexible bending and working type of thing.
[20:16.480 --> 20:19.540]  And it also takes nine to 10 weeks to flower.
[20:19.540 --> 20:21.440]  Most of my other stuff is done by nine.
[20:21.440 --> 20:23.220]  This one's going to take that extra week.
[20:23.220 --> 20:25.000]  I recommend nine or 10.
[20:25.000 --> 20:27.900]  Some phenotypes will want 11 weeks.
[20:28.340 --> 20:32.300]  I mentioned earlier, we're going to get gigantic buds.
[20:32.300 --> 20:37.020]  Sometimes you're going to see four to six foot long colas off of these plants, but it
[20:37.020 --> 20:41.620]  is kind of a pain in the ass for a new grower to manage that monstrous of a plant.
[20:41.620 --> 20:44.380]  I recommend an experienced grower to grow these plants.
[20:44.380 --> 20:45.380]  Don't be afraid.
[20:45.380 --> 20:47.860]  I just think that it takes a little bit of extra work.
[20:47.860 --> 20:49.220]  It's going to need more supports.
[20:49.220 --> 20:51.080]  You're going to have to pay more attention.
[20:51.080 --> 20:55.140]  It's going to take a little bit longer, which gives you more opportunity for problems.
[20:55.140 --> 20:57.740]  So this is not a beginner plant.
[20:57.780 --> 21:02.060]  But like anything that requires hard work, the rewards are very worth it.
[21:02.060 --> 21:05.900]  Those phenotypes that are more challenging to grow, those phenotypes which take longer
[21:05.900 --> 21:10.260]  to flower are usually, generally, more extremely potent.
[21:10.260 --> 21:14.920]  If you've got that 11-weeker, when you smoke that thing, you are going to go silly.
[21:14.920 --> 21:17.180]  Your eyes are going to go, what the fuck just happened?
[21:17.180 --> 21:20.300]  You're going to sit down in the chair and wonder if you're melting, but then your brain
[21:20.300 --> 21:22.740]  is going to fly to the moon and back without you.
[21:22.740 --> 21:28.540]  If you get those 11-week phenotypes, the high will rip your head off and it is impressive.
[21:28.540 --> 21:32.940]  So now let's kind of talk about some of the phenotypes which I have hinted at.
[21:32.940 --> 21:39.300]  There is the beautiful East Coast Panama chunk to TK Stardog dominant phenotype, which is
[21:39.300 --> 21:40.300]  beautiful.
[21:40.300 --> 21:41.300]  It's real chocolatey.
[21:41.300 --> 21:45.040]  It's got that beautiful bright green color that comes from the Stardog.
[21:45.040 --> 21:48.900]  It's got those bright orange pistils that comes from the Stardog, and then it just smells
[21:48.900 --> 21:49.900]  funky.
[21:49.900 --> 21:52.420]  And then it's got kind of a little bit of a fluffy look to the buds.
[21:53.100 --> 21:54.820]  They aren't as tight as some of the other phenotypes.
[21:54.820 --> 21:59.860]  If you've got the fluffier phenotype, that is probably coming from the East Coast Panama
[21:59.860 --> 22:00.940]  chunk.
[22:00.940 --> 22:07.700]  Then there is the 50-50 phenotype, which looks just like the TK Stardog, just like the Arise.
[22:07.700 --> 22:10.420]  It's got a little bit of Golden Goat resemblance to it.
[22:10.420 --> 22:11.820]  It's got a sweet smell to it.
[22:11.820 --> 22:15.340]  It's got a chocolatey smell to it, and it's got a dirty funk to it.
[22:15.340 --> 22:16.540]  It grows beautifully.
[22:16.540 --> 22:18.140]  It's got nice tight buds.
[22:18.140 --> 22:20.520]  This one makes decent amounts of branching.
[22:20.520 --> 22:23.800]  It's not real ridiculous like the East Coast Panama chunk.
[22:23.800 --> 22:28.000]  Then I often see basically an Arise phenotype come out of this.
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.280]  It looks just like Arise number four.
[22:30.280 --> 22:32.120]  It looks just like King Solomon.
[22:32.120 --> 22:36.320]  It looks very simply, smells very simply, just like Arise.
[22:36.320 --> 22:41.160]  Then there is the one that I call the Leggy Girl or the Tall Girl or the fucking Fishing
[22:41.160 --> 22:42.160]  Pole.
[22:42.160 --> 22:43.440]  This one just takes off.
[22:43.440 --> 22:45.600]  I believe you can see it in Veg.
[22:45.600 --> 22:51.080]  It creates one long skinny branch with just a few side branches coming off.
[22:51.080 --> 22:53.440]  Sometimes it'll make really long side branches that come off.
[22:53.440 --> 22:57.560]  If you chop those off, that'll just make one giant fucking kola grow up, that whole branch.
[22:57.560 --> 22:59.160]  It's ridiculous.
[22:59.160 --> 23:01.120]  That phenotype, I talked about it earlier.
[23:01.120 --> 23:02.120]  It's fun.
[23:02.120 --> 23:03.320]  It's also a pain in the ass.
[23:03.320 --> 23:07.860]  If you think you've got that one and you're in an indoor environment, flower early and
[23:07.860 --> 23:11.060]  see what you've got, you may have something fucking amazing.
[23:11.060 --> 23:15.000]  There is another phenotype which scared some of my test growers.
[23:15.000 --> 23:18.040]  They all thought that they had a problem they could not identify.
[23:18.040 --> 23:22.120]  There is a phenotype which will make very droopy leaves.
[23:22.120 --> 23:24.820]  That comes from the Daybreaker.
[23:24.820 --> 23:28.680]  For some reason, that Daybreaker makes gigantic leaves.
[23:28.680 --> 23:32.440]  No matter how much you feed it, that bitch does not want to lift those leaves up.
[23:32.440 --> 23:34.240]  They just stay a little bit droopy.
[23:34.240 --> 23:35.240]  It looks like it's not dying.
[23:35.240 --> 23:37.040]  It just looks lazy.
[23:37.040 --> 23:42.040]  Most growers would say it needs water, but you water the plant and it doesn't go up.
[23:42.040 --> 23:45.640]  Those leaves are so big that I think the plant just can't even support them.
[23:45.640 --> 23:48.280]  They're just like, no, you're going three quarters of the way up.
[23:48.280 --> 23:49.600]  That's all you get out of me, bro.
[23:49.600 --> 23:51.600]  I think that is a Daybreaker trait.
[23:51.600 --> 23:54.400]  I don't see any problem with those plants.
[23:54.400 --> 23:58.780]  If you've got giant leaves that are dark green, getting a little bit purple up the middle
[23:58.780 --> 24:01.060]  of them, that is a Daybreaker trait.
[24:01.060 --> 24:03.840]  If they are drooping, that is a trait from the Daybreaker.
[24:03.840 --> 24:04.840]  Don't worry.
[24:04.840 --> 24:06.480]  I don't think that is a problem.
[24:06.480 --> 24:09.340]  That plant is going to be very indica dominant.
[24:09.340 --> 24:13.260]  In most cases, that one makes you want to sit on your ass all day.
[24:13.260 --> 24:17.040]  I've noticed that one gives me dragon red eyes also.
[24:17.040 --> 24:19.480]  That will make your eyes super red.
[24:19.480 --> 24:22.500]  That one is mostly dominated by the Daybreaker.
[24:22.500 --> 24:26.300]  I think that one is honestly mostly dominated by the Joseph OG.
[24:26.300 --> 24:29.920]  It could have some of that East Coast Panama chunk because it gets that funky chocolate
[24:29.920 --> 24:32.380]  flavor and aroma to it also.
[24:32.380 --> 24:33.560]  Now there is one more phenotype.
[24:33.560 --> 24:36.560]  I know I've listed a bunch of phenotypes, but I've got to be honest with you, there
[24:36.560 --> 24:38.660]  is variation in this line.
[24:38.660 --> 24:39.660]  Some people love that.
[24:39.660 --> 24:40.940]  Some people do not.
[24:40.940 --> 24:46.300]  There is a phenotype that makes taco leaves that is very golden goat dominant.
[24:46.300 --> 24:49.780]  Golden goat will get pissed off and make taco leaves laid in flower.
[24:49.780 --> 24:54.180]  So if you see some big chunky buds that are a little bit foxtaily that start making a
[24:54.180 --> 24:58.080]  little bit of taco leaf, maybe you get some pointy tips on the buds out of there, maybe
[24:58.080 --> 25:02.260]  a little bit thinner leaf, that is the one that I call the taco leaf phenotype that is
[25:02.260 --> 25:04.620]  very golden goat dominant.
[25:04.620 --> 25:07.060]  You're seeing a lot of golden goat traits from that plant.
[25:07.060 --> 25:08.500]  That's still a wonderful plant.
[25:09.340 --> 25:12.860]  It will finish beautifully, but it is going to taco almost no matter what you do, the
[25:12.860 --> 25:16.820]  leaves are going to, we call it taco leaf or canoeing, but they also frost up and get
[25:16.820 --> 25:17.820]  covered in resin.
[25:17.820 --> 25:22.420]  So it looks like shit, but it is super potent bud.
[25:22.420 --> 25:27.020]  Most of those phenotypes, like I've said before, are going to finish in about nine to 10 weeks.
[25:27.020 --> 25:29.460]  You will find outliers that will take 11 weeks.
[25:29.460 --> 25:33.020]  There are also outliers that will take a little bit longer.
[25:33.020 --> 25:37.160]  If you are in the right location, many of these phenotypes will be amazing plants for
[25:37.160 --> 25:38.480]  outdoor cultivation.
[25:38.480 --> 25:41.960]  You will get huge harvests if you take care of these plants properly.
[25:41.960 --> 25:46.640]  If you're in a greenhouse, you should have a good outcome if you manage the plants properly.
[25:46.640 --> 25:50.760]  This plant will work very well indoors if you are good at managing your height and if
[25:50.760 --> 25:54.440]  you know what to expect, you've got to find the appropriate phenotype for yourself.
[25:54.440 --> 25:58.280]  Don't be afraid because I've talked about all of these large, tall plants.
[25:58.280 --> 26:02.060]  I run Dragon Punch from seed in a five by five grow tent.
[26:02.060 --> 26:03.320]  That is my test area.
[26:03.320 --> 26:07.340]  And I'm able to get beautiful crops from that plant in a five by five grow tent.
[26:07.340 --> 26:08.700]  You just have to flower early.
[26:08.700 --> 26:11.700]  You have to understand how to manipulate the plants and keep them short.
[26:11.700 --> 26:14.700]  Don't be intimidated by tall, long flowering plants.
[26:14.700 --> 26:18.080]  It may be a fun experiment for some of you really experienced growers who've just been
[26:18.080 --> 26:20.140]  focused on eight or nine week strains.
[26:20.140 --> 26:24.160]  All right, my friends, I want to thank you for listening to my strain review on Dragon
