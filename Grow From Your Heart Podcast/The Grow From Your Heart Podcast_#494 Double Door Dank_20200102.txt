[00:00.000 --> 00:01.000]  All right, here we go.
[00:01.000 --> 00:02.240]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02.240 --> 00:06.320]  It is time for episode 494 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.320 --> 00:09.440]  Sitting across the table from me is my buddy Double Door Dank.
[00:09.440 --> 00:12.040]  I did not ask if you want me to use your real name.
[00:12.040 --> 00:13.040]  Welcome to the show, bro.
[00:13.040 --> 00:14.680]  Hey, how's it going, man?
[00:14.680 --> 00:16.760]  Should I call you by your real name or do you want to be Double Door today?
[00:16.760 --> 00:17.760]  You can call me Matt.
[00:17.760 --> 00:19.320]  All right, this is Matt joining us.
[00:19.320 --> 00:20.320]  Thanks for being here, brother.
[00:20.320 --> 00:21.320]  Oh, man, I appreciate it.
[00:21.320 --> 00:24.800]  It's funny, for a long time when we first met, I only knew you as Double Door.
[00:24.800 --> 00:27.560]  And when you said, this is Matt, I was like, who the fuck is Matt?
[00:27.560 --> 00:30.280]  It took me a couple of hours, I was like, I don't know anybody named Matt.
[00:30.280 --> 00:31.720]  I know Double Door Dank, man.
[00:31.720 --> 00:33.080]  That's my buddy over there on the south side.
[00:33.080 --> 00:36.600]  Oh, no, I started having fun with it because you didn't know my email either.
[00:36.600 --> 00:37.600]  Oh, yeah.
[00:37.600 --> 00:40.560]  Yeah, so then I really threw you for a loop because I was like, I'll watch this.
[00:40.560 --> 00:41.560]  I'm going to email him.
[00:41.560 --> 00:42.560]  He has no idea.
[00:42.560 --> 00:46.320]  And I left my name off of that and he used it in a podcast.
[00:46.320 --> 00:52.080]  And I was the guy who didn't put his name because I'm tripping Ross to Jeff out.
[00:52.080 --> 00:56.240]  I think when we go to any event, I'm going to recommend this for the Indo Expo.
[00:56.440 --> 00:58.160]  No, it'll take way too long.
[00:58.160 --> 00:59.680]  Anything where we're going to interact a lot.
[00:59.680 --> 01:03.440]  I think we should all have name tags because I've got it.
[01:03.440 --> 01:04.960]  I'm a stoner, first of all.
[01:04.960 --> 01:06.480]  That's going to be my first excuse.
[01:06.480 --> 01:11.400]  I've got a brain injury and I meet a lot of people and it's hard to remember everybody's.
[01:11.400 --> 01:12.600]  First I got to remember your face.
[01:12.600 --> 01:14.160]  That bell goes off.
[01:14.160 --> 01:16.560]  That primal memory thing happens where I know your face.
[01:16.560 --> 01:17.680]  I know who you are.
[01:17.680 --> 01:19.880]  But then I've got to find all of your labels.
[01:19.880 --> 01:22.920]  I used to just have to remember there's my friend Matt.
[01:22.920 --> 01:29.240]  Now I've got to go Matt Double Door Dank, also known as whatever whatever at gmail.com.
[01:29.240 --> 01:30.920]  Also the owner of this company.
[01:30.920 --> 01:31.920]  Also the guy that does this.
[01:31.920 --> 01:35.160]  I've got to run through this encyclopedia of things about people now.
[01:35.160 --> 01:39.400]  Yeah, it's almost gotten to like where you have a login and password for every freaking
[01:39.400 --> 01:41.560]  thing in this life.
[01:41.560 --> 01:42.560]  Everything.
[01:42.560 --> 01:43.560]  Yeah.
[01:43.560 --> 01:44.560]  Just to remember the names.
[01:44.560 --> 01:46.680]  You've got to pull out your phone and like do some facial recognition just to get everybody's
[01:46.680 --> 01:48.800]  memory called back into your memory now.
[01:48.800 --> 01:49.800]  Yeah.
[01:49.800 --> 01:50.800]  I can barely do that.
[01:50.800 --> 01:53.320]  Much less remember everybody's Instagram and all that.
[01:53.320 --> 01:54.320]  I'm just going to call you.
[01:54.320 --> 01:55.320]  Hey, hey, dude.
[01:55.320 --> 01:56.320]  What's up, bro?
[01:56.320 --> 01:57.320]  What's up, man?
[01:57.320 --> 02:01.000]  Unfortunately, I catch myself doing the the Hollywood smile.
[02:01.000 --> 02:02.000]  What's up, bro?
[02:02.000 --> 02:03.000]  It's good to see you.
[02:03.000 --> 02:05.960]  And it's because I that that's a general that's good to meet you.
[02:05.960 --> 02:06.960]  Good to see you.
[02:06.960 --> 02:07.960]  Good to see you again.
[02:07.960 --> 02:08.960]  That can mean a lot of things.
[02:08.960 --> 02:09.960]  And I'm not sure sometimes.
[02:09.960 --> 02:10.960]  Yeah.
[02:10.960 --> 02:15.480]  And I feel like how you've been is not, you know, something that anybody wouldn't want
[02:15.480 --> 02:16.480]  to answer.
[02:16.480 --> 02:17.480]  Shit.
[02:17.480 --> 02:18.480]  Yeah.
[02:18.480 --> 02:19.720]  It's like, hey, you know, what's up?
[02:20.640 --> 02:22.400]  And smile and let them proceed.
[02:22.400 --> 02:24.840]  They'll tell me what they want or what they need.
[02:24.840 --> 02:25.920]  No offense to everybody else.
[02:25.920 --> 02:27.400]  I am really recognizable.
[02:27.400 --> 02:28.720]  I'm six foot five.
[02:28.720 --> 02:32.040]  I've got dreadlocks to my fucking knees, almost the calves these days.
[02:32.040 --> 02:36.000]  I got a big cheesy smile and I'm behind the booth with my brand name on it.
[02:36.000 --> 02:37.920]  So everybody knows who that guy is.
[02:37.920 --> 02:40.320]  It's hard for me to remember.
[02:40.320 --> 02:46.320]  I'll remember your faces, but God, putting Matt and Double Door or Jim and at good weed
[02:46.320 --> 02:48.840]  dot net together, it's become such a challenge.
[02:48.960 --> 02:49.960]  Oh, yeah.
[02:49.960 --> 02:51.240]  Welcome to the weed world, you guys.
[02:51.240 --> 02:52.840]  Jesus is going to be a stony, rambly show.
[02:52.840 --> 02:53.840]  I love these episodes.
[02:53.840 --> 02:54.840]  We're off to some good chemistry.
[02:54.840 --> 02:57.840]  We've been hanging out for a little bit, having some nice chats.
[02:57.840 --> 02:58.840]  It's been a good time.
[02:58.840 --> 02:59.840]  Thanks for coming.
[02:59.840 --> 03:00.840]  Oh, yeah.
[03:00.840 --> 03:03.480]  I think one of the best things going to the events and just standing there at your table
[03:03.480 --> 03:08.120]  and watching people just meet you for the first time and not realizing how freaking
[03:08.120 --> 03:13.640]  big you are, like, you know, even if somebody thought they hated you online, no, you're
[03:13.640 --> 03:17.840]  going to be the happiest dude to see that person when you see how big Ross, the W.
[03:17.840 --> 03:19.640]  Nope, not a chance.
[03:19.640 --> 03:22.160]  I forget sometimes that I am.
[03:22.160 --> 03:23.800]  I am six foot five.
[03:23.800 --> 03:26.280]  And a lot of people, they hear the number and they go, sure, he's tall.
[03:26.280 --> 03:29.920]  But then some people, it's usually guys that are not six feet tall.
[03:29.920 --> 03:32.680]  They look at you and go, oh, fuck, you're tall.
[03:32.680 --> 03:35.800]  Ten percent of the people, the first thing they say when they meet me is, holy shit,
[03:35.800 --> 03:36.800]  you're tall.
[03:36.800 --> 03:40.240]  Another ten percent of the people, the first thing they say is, damn, your dreads are long.
[03:40.240 --> 03:42.000]  So I try not to be intimidating.
[03:42.000 --> 03:43.560]  I try to come off as peaceful.
[03:43.560 --> 03:46.080]  But yeah, I'm kind of a tall, memorable folk.
[03:46.400 --> 03:50.560]  Yeah. And it's also it's just funny watching people look up at you, too, when they walk
[03:50.560 --> 03:54.560]  up to the booth and just like, and I'm totally not sure if I should bend down, if I should
[03:54.560 --> 03:55.920]  just stay up here.
[03:55.920 --> 03:57.840]  Yeah. Yeah. It's awkward, but I love it.
[03:57.840 --> 03:59.280]  No, you do a great job.
[03:59.280 --> 04:00.160]  Thank you, bro. Thank you.
[04:00.160 --> 04:01.920]  Living the dream, having a good time.
[04:01.920 --> 04:03.280]  We keep talking about the Endo Expo.
[04:03.280 --> 04:07.520]  I hope to see all of my friends at the Endo Expo, January 25th and 26th in Denver,
[04:07.520 --> 04:10.120]  Colorado. It is at the Denver Mart.
[04:10.120 --> 04:12.800]  I think that's like 58th in Washington.
[04:12.800 --> 04:14.880]  Sunday is open to the general public.
[04:14.880 --> 04:17.120]  Saturday is business to business day.
[04:17.800 --> 04:21.520]  I encourage you to come on Sunday, but I do encourage you to get your tickets and your
[04:21.520 --> 04:25.800]  travel arrangements made now because the event will sell out.
[04:25.800 --> 04:28.800]  Many people from around the world come to this event.
[04:28.800 --> 04:30.000]  This is a big deal.
[04:30.000 --> 04:36.000]  It's the one of the world's largest indoor cultivation expos that you will ever find.
[04:36.000 --> 04:39.120]  It's in Denver. So, of course, there are a lot of people available.
[04:39.120 --> 04:40.600]  A lot of people want to hit this one.
[04:40.600 --> 04:42.800]  Join us. I'm at booth 533.
[04:42.800 --> 04:44.160]  I look forward to seeing you there.
[04:45.520 --> 04:48.480]  Also, one more ad, then we'll get moving into the real part of the show.
[04:49.120 --> 04:51.520]  This podcast is brought to you by our friends at SeedsHereNow.
[04:51.520 --> 04:52.640]  SeedsHereNow.com.
[04:52.640 --> 04:56.000]  If you need new, regular, feminized, or auto flower seeds in your garden,
[04:56.000 --> 04:57.600]  Seeds Here Now is the place for you.
[04:57.600 --> 05:02.000]  You can find them at SeedsHereNow.com.
[05:02.000 --> 05:02.560]  There we go.
[05:02.560 --> 05:04.240]  This is the part of the show where it gets fun.
[05:04.240 --> 05:06.560]  We're going to talk about the stuff we've been smoking on.
[05:08.000 --> 05:12.320]  Double Door over here showed up with some jars of some Double Door Dank.
[05:12.320 --> 05:13.920]  Bro, let's talk about what you brought.
[05:13.920 --> 05:14.720]  What's in the little jar?
[05:14.720 --> 05:16.560]  Since that one's kind of rare, you only got a little bit of it.
[05:16.560 --> 05:17.280]  We'll start there.
[05:18.160 --> 05:20.080]  I've got some cookies and cream in this one.
[05:21.360 --> 05:27.440]  It's one of my favorite Finos as far as frost and just average cookie crust.
[05:27.440 --> 05:30.160]  This one is one of the harder hitting, more OG style,
[05:31.040 --> 05:35.520]  more gassy leaning than most of the cookie process where you get that really doughy flavor
[05:36.160 --> 05:40.880]  and kind of more subtle effects from some of the Girl Scout cookies.
[05:41.760 --> 05:44.640]  The cream has more of the OG, will knock you out.
[05:45.280 --> 05:46.080]  I kind of like that.
[05:46.800 --> 05:48.800]  I've kept it around in my garden for quite a while.
[05:50.720 --> 05:53.040]  That's the cookies and cream, not the cream, right?
[05:53.040 --> 05:53.280]  Yeah.
[05:53.840 --> 05:56.400]  That's actually the parent to the cookies and cream crust.
[05:56.400 --> 05:57.040]  It's the mommy.
[05:57.600 --> 05:57.920]  Yeah.
[05:57.920 --> 05:59.280]  No, I enjoy it.
[05:59.280 --> 06:00.720]  It's one of my favorites.
[06:00.720 --> 06:06.640]  It's not one of my favorites to grow, but the bud from it is worth having.
[06:06.640 --> 06:11.280]  Isn't that such a gamble, a compromise you have to make as a grower?
[06:11.280 --> 06:14.640]  You're like, man, this tastes so good and the buzz is so amazing,
[06:14.640 --> 06:19.280]  but I'm only going to get three quarters of what I would get from this other plant.
[06:19.280 --> 06:20.400]  So you have to make this choice.
[06:20.400 --> 06:23.440]  Do I want to grow more or do I want really good?
[06:23.440 --> 06:26.320]  And you're like myself, you'd say, I'm going to go for the really good.
[06:26.320 --> 06:31.280]  I'll just maybe not smoke that extra fourth bowl every day and I'll grow this really dank shit.
[06:31.280 --> 06:31.600]  Yeah.
[06:31.840 --> 06:37.440]  You know, I'm one of those connoisseurs where I appreciate the way bud looks and
[06:37.440 --> 06:42.960]  I'm mostly a flower smoker and that's because I enjoy it.
[06:42.960 --> 06:47.200]  I'm also a grower and with dabs and concentrates, you don't get a chance
[06:47.760 --> 06:51.200]  to really see what the strain has to offer density-wise,
[06:52.000 --> 06:54.400]  if I'd want to put it in my garden and stuff like that.
[06:54.400 --> 06:59.840]  So I'll always keep flower and if it's a really good strain, I'm definitely keeping it around.
[06:59.840 --> 07:01.120]  You've got some good genetics.
[07:01.120 --> 07:01.840]  I've seen your garden.
[07:01.840 --> 07:04.160]  We're going to talk about your grow and your grow style here in a little bit.
[07:04.880 --> 07:07.520]  Definitely very visually appealing buds.
[07:07.520 --> 07:08.880]  Your buds have great bag appeal.
[07:08.880 --> 07:10.080]  They're very well trimmed.
[07:10.080 --> 07:11.920]  I didn't say that earlier when I was looking at them.
[07:11.920 --> 07:14.320]  Someone stays up all night trimming, I bet.
[07:14.320 --> 07:14.560]  Yeah.
[07:15.200 --> 07:22.160]  That's a lot of hard work and Dr. Pepper caffeine pushing me through the nights,
[07:22.960 --> 07:24.080]  but it's worth it to me.
[07:24.640 --> 07:30.480]  I feel like you can tell when somebody spent a lot of love and time on a product just because
[07:31.760 --> 07:34.720]  you see sloppy work and you're just a little let down.
[07:35.280 --> 07:35.680]  Yeah.
[07:35.680 --> 07:37.840]  Well, I can absolutely tell the difference between...
[07:37.840 --> 07:38.800]  That's connoisseur bud.
[07:38.800 --> 07:40.800]  That is grade A connoisseur top shelf bud.
[07:40.800 --> 07:42.720]  That is not dispensary weed.
[07:42.720 --> 07:44.080]  It's not machine trimmed.
[07:44.080 --> 07:46.560]  I can tell there was some love and I'm not just kissing your ass.
[07:46.560 --> 07:49.600]  You gave me a bud and you encouraged me to break it up so that I could smell the inner
[07:49.600 --> 07:51.600]  aromas and we're going to talk about the smell of that one.
[07:52.640 --> 07:53.920]  Let's move on and talk about this strain.
[07:53.920 --> 07:55.200]  So we talked about the cookies and cream.
[07:55.200 --> 07:56.400]  What's this other jar you brought?
[07:57.200 --> 07:58.880]  This is actually one of my favorites.
[07:58.880 --> 08:00.880]  This is Motor Breath, crossed it now and later.
[08:01.760 --> 08:05.120]  Both of which are strains that are pretty popular here in Colorado.
[08:06.400 --> 08:11.200]  Now and later has more of the fruity gas and Motor Breath is pretty much straight gas,
[08:11.200 --> 08:11.760]  SFV.
[08:13.920 --> 08:15.920]  It's a heavy OG.
[08:15.920 --> 08:20.400]  So it's kind of the best of both worlds because it's what I look for in bud.
[08:21.040 --> 08:25.680]  But not only is it good for me, I've had a few friends who have medical issues who've
[08:25.680 --> 08:31.040]  tried it out and it's actually a pretty successful one for a few conditions as well.
[08:31.600 --> 08:32.000]  Good herb.
[08:32.000 --> 08:32.640]  I smoked some.
[08:32.640 --> 08:34.000]  I'm stoned as shit.
[08:34.000 --> 08:35.520]  I've got the heavy eyes.
[08:35.520 --> 08:36.800]  I've talked about it a lot on the show.
[08:36.800 --> 08:38.960]  When I dab, I feel like I get bug-eyed.
[08:38.960 --> 08:40.400]  I'm like, oh, I'm high as fuck.
[08:40.400 --> 08:44.800]  When I smoked some of this, I've called it Mendo later or now in Mendo.
[08:44.800 --> 08:46.480]  I just created a fun name for it in my head.
[08:46.480 --> 08:49.040]  But when I smoked that, my eyes got droopy.
[08:49.040 --> 08:50.320]  I got settled down a little bit.
[08:50.320 --> 08:52.400]  I got stoned instead of being super high.
[08:52.400 --> 08:54.000]  That shit made me stoned.
[08:54.000 --> 08:58.160]  What I was getting at is you handed me a bud and you encouraged me to break it open because
[08:58.160 --> 09:00.640]  you wanted me to smell it so that I could describe the smells.
[09:01.360 --> 09:08.480]  Um, there's a very unique smell aroma coming from the now and later Mendo breath cross.
[09:08.480 --> 09:10.880]  I described it as several things.
[09:10.880 --> 09:15.360]  There's a very dominant white grape peach juice sort of a thing.
[09:15.360 --> 09:20.640]  But then in the background, there's something, uh, earthy and harsh, but in a good way.
[09:20.640 --> 09:26.080]  I'm not saying like harsh in a bad way, but whatever it is itself is not something you
[09:26.080 --> 09:28.080]  would think is pleasant to eat or smoke.
[09:28.080 --> 09:30.160]  It's like leather or maybe beef jerky.
[09:30.160 --> 09:32.560]  I want to say maybe peach, grape, beef jerky.
[09:33.200 --> 09:33.680]  Oh yeah.
[09:33.680 --> 09:37.760]  And then, you know, what's funny is I've let quite a few different people smell this and
[09:37.760 --> 09:39.680]  ask them because I wasn't too sure.
[09:39.680 --> 09:43.360]  It's very hard to put your finger on what this phenose smells like.
[09:43.360 --> 09:45.680]  It's a very intoxicating smell.
[09:45.680 --> 09:50.640]  You don't want to stop smelling it, but you can't figure out what it is that you are smelling
[09:50.640 --> 09:51.120]  right now.
[09:51.120 --> 09:52.560]  I keep going back to the jargon.
[09:52.560 --> 09:53.600]  What is that?
[09:53.600 --> 09:54.480]  It's really good.
[09:55.440 --> 10:00.000]  I described it almost as if I had grapes and berries in a tool belt.
[10:00.880 --> 10:02.160]  Yeah, it's a nice mix.
[10:02.880 --> 10:04.560]  And the leathery is there.
[10:04.560 --> 10:11.200]  I've heard burnt rubber as well, a little on the gassy side, but grapefruit in there
[10:11.200 --> 10:11.520]  as well.
[10:11.520 --> 10:14.720]  So the combination is, I guess, an old man.
[10:15.920 --> 10:17.280]  It's grapefruit and leather.
[10:18.880 --> 10:23.440]  I pictured this old man just, you know, carving a stick on his porch or something, I guess.
[10:24.160 --> 10:24.960]  It's really unique.
[10:24.960 --> 10:25.760]  It got me stoned.
[10:25.760 --> 10:26.160]  I like it.
[10:26.160 --> 10:26.960]  It tastes good.
[10:26.960 --> 10:28.240]  That one, you cured it very well.
[10:28.240 --> 10:29.280]  It was one of the things I wanted.
[10:29.280 --> 10:35.200]  When I broke it open, not only did I get those leather and grape aromas, it's got the proper
[10:35.200 --> 10:36.160]  sponginess.
[10:36.160 --> 10:38.080]  It's not wet, but it's spongy still.
[10:38.080 --> 10:38.960]  It's not crunchy.
[10:38.960 --> 10:41.520]  It doesn't have the Colorado crunch, which I complain about.
[10:41.520 --> 10:45.600]  So I was impressed by your cure work, which shows that also you're really paying attention
[10:45.600 --> 10:47.200]  to details there when it comes to growing it.
[10:47.200 --> 10:51.040]  Not only did you trim the shit out of it, did you wet or dry trim that?
[10:51.040 --> 10:51.680]  Dry trim.
[10:51.680 --> 10:52.000]  All right.
[10:52.000 --> 10:53.120]  Yeah, team dry trim.
[10:53.440 --> 10:57.680]  All the big boys are dry trim and I get a lot of questions if I prefer wet or dry, and
[10:57.680 --> 10:59.520]  I absolutely prefer a dry trim.
[11:00.400 --> 11:04.640]  You know, anytime you do wet trim, I think it releases a lot of the chlorophyll kind
[11:04.640 --> 11:06.320]  of flavor into that bud.
[11:07.200 --> 11:11.120]  Making more cuts in the leaves and more opportunities for that moisture to open up.
[11:11.120 --> 11:11.440]  Yeah.
[11:11.440 --> 11:18.080]  And, you know, that may not be 100% true, but, you know, as when I was a younger grower,
[11:18.080 --> 11:23.520]  it seemed the case that if I tried to wet trim, the flavor and stuff wasn't as good
[11:23.520 --> 11:24.480]  in the cure.
[11:24.480 --> 11:31.040]  Whereas now I do a very controlled curing process where the humidity and everything
[11:31.040 --> 11:35.920]  is monitored much closer and I do jar cure everything.
[11:36.480 --> 11:40.560]  You're kind of on a smaller batch, so it's really easy to do the jar cure.
[11:40.560 --> 11:42.400]  Is this the size jar you cured it in?
[11:42.400 --> 11:42.720]  Yeah.
[11:42.720 --> 11:44.240]  Is that a pint or a quart?
[11:44.240 --> 11:46.000]  It's one of the bigger mason jars, you guys.
[11:46.000 --> 11:46.640]  I'm looking for the size.
[11:46.640 --> 11:47.440]  It's not printed on here.
[11:47.440 --> 11:49.600]  They don't do that anymore, but it's one of the bigger mason jars.
[11:49.600 --> 11:52.960]  Not giant, but, you know, like a big spaghetti jar, big spaghetti sauce jar.
[11:52.960 --> 11:54.640]  It's almost baller jar.
[11:54.640 --> 11:55.040]  Yeah.
[11:55.040 --> 11:55.360]  Yeah.
[11:55.360 --> 11:56.560]  It's a good size jar of weed, man.
[11:56.560 --> 11:58.240]  That's a nice jar to carry around.
[11:58.240 --> 11:58.480]  Yeah.
[11:58.480 --> 11:58.720]  Yeah.
[11:58.720 --> 12:05.040]  You know, I was mainly excited to bring some by to smoke with you because this is one of
[12:05.040 --> 12:07.920]  the harvests that, you know, kind of everything goes right.
[12:07.920 --> 12:12.560]  And I don't think a lot of people realize, you know, not every round goes right when
[12:12.560 --> 12:13.760]  you get really good stuff.
[12:13.760 --> 12:16.240]  It's kind of a miracle that we got it.
[12:16.240 --> 12:22.320]  The difference between that quality and middle shelf dispensary quality is two mistakes.
[12:22.320 --> 12:26.880]  One mistake you can kind of, oh, I can, I hope I can rescue this and keep it top shelf
[12:26.880 --> 12:27.280]  quality.
[12:27.280 --> 12:31.920]  Two mistakes or one thing you're not paying attention to properly would bring that down.
[12:32.480 --> 12:34.800]  Such major quality difference.
[12:34.800 --> 12:40.480]  You only get these plants for about 120, 150 days, depending on how your cycles go, maybe
[12:40.480 --> 12:42.160]  90 days for some people.
[12:42.160 --> 12:43.760]  You've got to make every day count.
[12:43.760 --> 12:49.120]  That's 150 opportunities to either degrade the quality or improve the quality.
[12:49.120 --> 12:52.080]  If you think you grow a hundred days, you got a hundred percent.
[12:52.080 --> 12:53.920]  Did you put in a hundred percent today?
[12:53.920 --> 12:59.440]  Because if you only put in 99% now your plant, you've only got 99% total potential to get
[12:59.440 --> 13:00.160]  to now.
[13:00.160 --> 13:04.160]  And if you grow in soil too, you know, it takes longer to notice deficiencies and stuff
[13:04.160 --> 13:05.040]  like that.
[13:05.040 --> 13:10.560]  So, you know, you may have cost yourself two weeks worth of, you know, damage to your plant
[13:10.560 --> 13:11.600]  to recover.
[13:11.600 --> 13:16.000]  And, you know, if you're already in flower, you know, you're setting yourself back in
[13:16.000 --> 13:20.080]  what you're going to yield, what your full returns are going to be at the end of that.
[13:20.080 --> 13:21.760]  Then you're doing what I call the chase.
[13:21.760 --> 13:24.960]  You got to chase that, whatever nutrient that is, you got to foliar feed it.
[13:24.960 --> 13:25.680]  You got to chase it.
[13:25.680 --> 13:29.120]  You got to catch that up before you can even get the plant back on track.
[13:29.120 --> 13:30.320]  And then, then you're screwed by the end.
[13:30.320 --> 13:31.360]  You'll never catch up.
[13:31.360 --> 13:33.760]  It's really hard to catch up with the plant that's in flower.
[13:33.760 --> 13:34.080]  Yep.
[13:34.080 --> 13:35.920]  Because then you're going to overfeed it and you're going to burn it.
[13:35.920 --> 13:37.920]  And then you got to redo all the process.
[13:38.720 --> 13:39.200]  Fun game.
[13:39.920 --> 13:41.200]  Bro, how long have you been growing?
[13:41.200 --> 13:42.400]  How many crops do you have under your belt?
[13:42.400 --> 13:43.440]  Cause this is good looking herb.
[13:44.320 --> 13:49.440]  Um, I guess, allegedly since I was 16, if you ask some of my...
[13:49.440 --> 13:50.240]  How old are you now, bro?
[13:50.240 --> 13:51.840]  I'm going to guess about 25 ish.
[13:51.840 --> 13:52.480]  29.
[13:52.480 --> 13:52.880]  29.
[13:52.880 --> 13:53.280]  All right, bro.
[13:53.280 --> 13:54.000]  You're looking good, man.
[13:54.000 --> 13:55.200]  Looking good for your old age.
[13:55.200 --> 13:56.000]  I appreciate that.
[13:58.400 --> 14:03.040]  But, you know, um, as far as professionally, you know, I've been in Colorado for three
[14:03.040 --> 14:08.240]  years now, uh, growing in facilities, uh, with some great people, great growers.
[14:08.240 --> 14:09.840]  You're going to make a Colorado joke here.
[14:09.840 --> 14:11.600]  You've been in Colorado for about three years.
[14:11.600 --> 14:14.400]  That means you've probably worked in six to eight facilities.
[14:15.120 --> 14:17.280]  Um, no, actually, uh,
[14:17.280 --> 14:18.480]  It's just a Colorado joke.
[14:18.480 --> 14:20.000]  All of our Colorado friends are going, yep.
[14:20.000 --> 14:21.280]  Sounds about fucking right.
[14:21.280 --> 14:23.840]  No, actually, you know, it was one facility.
[14:23.840 --> 14:30.000]  It changed, um, changed management a couple of times, but you know, other than that, I
[14:30.000 --> 14:32.640]  stuck around, uh, I enjoyed it and they were great people.
[14:33.360 --> 14:34.560]  It's a very new industry.
[14:34.560 --> 14:39.280]  So all of our friends in other States, it's a new industry and, um, lead growers only
[14:39.280 --> 14:40.880]  last about a year in a facility.
[14:40.880 --> 14:43.760]  Once you get going, once you get comfortable, something just goes on.
[14:43.760 --> 14:49.600]  There's a lead grower, a management, uh, an investor staff, HR, and then everybody goes,
[14:49.600 --> 14:51.840]  Hey, it's been a year, new lead grower.
[14:51.840 --> 14:53.840]  It just feels like that's how it happens in this industry.
[14:53.840 --> 14:58.480]  A lot, a lot of over a lot of turnover, a lot of management changes, a lot of standard,
[14:58.480 --> 15:00.640]  standard operating procedure changes overnight.
[15:01.280 --> 15:02.960]  It's a new blossoming industry.
[15:02.960 --> 15:04.160]  It's very interesting.
[15:04.160 --> 15:04.560]  Yeah.
[15:04.560 --> 15:09.680]  You know, and there's a lot of opportunities even outside of our state opening up with
[15:09.680 --> 15:11.840]  Oklahoma becoming legal and stuff like that.
[15:11.840 --> 15:18.480]  So even the companies here, you see expanding and, you know, going new places and it's kind
[15:18.480 --> 15:19.040]  of exciting.
[15:19.040 --> 15:23.840]  Honestly, I love seeing my friends that started stuff here that have been here since the beginning
[15:23.840 --> 15:24.640]  of medical.
[15:24.640 --> 15:27.840]  And then I see them pop up in places like Massachusetts and Oklahoma.
[15:27.840 --> 15:29.680]  And they're like, look, I'm killing it out here.
[15:29.680 --> 15:30.560]  And I'm like, I love it.
[15:30.560 --> 15:34.560]  I love seeing the people that have some clout, that know what they're doing, that understand,
[15:34.560 --> 15:38.640]  not just the industry, but the plant and the patients and all of the aspects of making
[15:38.640 --> 15:39.520]  it work.
[15:39.520 --> 15:41.440]  A lot of people know how to set up a grow.
[15:41.440 --> 15:43.360]  A lot of people can set up a business.
[15:43.360 --> 15:46.080]  A lot of people can set up some sort of extraction lab.
[15:46.080 --> 15:48.160]  So many of them can't do all of it.
[15:48.160 --> 15:52.960]  And they end up messing up either the business end, the tax end, the rules, somewhere they
[15:52.960 --> 15:53.280]  miss it.
[15:53.280 --> 15:57.280]  So I'm really proud of my friends that get it all together because that's a huge challenge.
[15:57.280 --> 15:57.680]  Oh yeah.
[15:58.400 --> 16:01.280]  So we want to talk about your style of growing.
[16:01.280 --> 16:02.240]  I've been to your spot.
[16:02.240 --> 16:04.320]  I've seen your very unique grow.
[16:05.040 --> 16:06.080]  You've got a cool style.
[16:06.640 --> 16:11.120]  You do what I call kind of a Coliseum grow and you called it a vertical grow.
[16:11.840 --> 16:17.200]  Do you want to explain to my listeners what is happening in your grow room and how maybe
[16:17.200 --> 16:18.800]  tell us how you got the idea?
[16:18.800 --> 16:20.560]  Yeah, this is fun.
[16:20.560 --> 16:22.400]  Stay on the mic for this part because yeah, yeah.
[16:22.400 --> 16:23.920]  They want to hear all the details for this.
[16:23.920 --> 16:24.960]  Yeah, this is a fun one.
[16:25.760 --> 16:31.440]  So vertical light growing is not to be confused with vertical integration.
[16:31.440 --> 16:37.920]  A lot of people are talking about vertical growing where they'll stack veg trays on top
[16:37.920 --> 16:40.800]  of different racks and do vertical that way.
[16:40.800 --> 16:46.400]  I'm talking vertical light growing, which is a two style HPS in the center of a room
[16:46.400 --> 16:48.480]  with plants stacked in a circle around it.
[16:49.440 --> 16:55.040]  So instead of most of our traditional light reflectors, the bulb would hang horizontally.
[16:55.040 --> 16:58.080]  You've basically taken the light bulb out of a reflector.
[16:58.080 --> 16:59.760]  There's no reflector around it.
[16:59.760 --> 17:05.040]  And now you're just hanging that bulb from the ceiling essentially, and it's hanging
[17:06.080 --> 17:06.560]  vertically.
[17:06.560 --> 17:07.840]  So the bulb is a long way.
[17:07.840 --> 17:11.680]  It looks like a big teardrop or a big raindrop hanging basically right in the center of the
[17:11.680 --> 17:12.240]  room, right?
[17:12.240 --> 17:19.280]  Yeah, and well, luckily I found a type of HPS light that offered a tube for air ducting.
[17:19.280 --> 17:25.120]  And basically, so instead of the traditional square bottom on it, it had a tube already.
[17:25.120 --> 17:27.120]  I could just remove the shield from around it.
[17:27.120 --> 17:27.600]  Cool.
[17:27.600 --> 17:34.880]  And as I removed the shield, I noticed it's a perfect tube.
[17:34.880 --> 17:36.640]  I can use this for vertical light growing.
[17:36.640 --> 17:41.360]  And hey, this will be something fun that I've never played with before.
[17:41.360 --> 17:42.240]  Let's give it a go.
[17:42.960 --> 17:49.600]  And the idea behind it is really that you get 360 degrees for your light bulb of what
[17:49.600 --> 17:50.320]  you're using.
[17:51.360 --> 17:53.760]  You're not reflecting half of your bulb.
[17:54.720 --> 17:58.240]  So my light energy doesn't have to go up and hit my reflector and then come down to the
[17:58.240 --> 17:58.640]  plants.
[17:58.640 --> 18:01.040]  It's coming off of the bulb to the plants.
[18:01.040 --> 18:01.360]  Yeah.
[18:01.360 --> 18:04.880]  And now you said that you've got the plants 360 around the bulb.
[18:04.880 --> 18:07.680]  So you guys imagine you've got a bulb hanging from the ceiling.
[18:08.240 --> 18:09.680]  Basically, it's a campfire.
[18:09.680 --> 18:12.160]  Imagine all the plants hanging out around the campfire.
[18:12.160 --> 18:16.800]  And I called it a Coliseum grow because it's just like, imagine you got a bunch of people
[18:16.800 --> 18:23.040]  in a Coliseum and the bulb is in the center and it creates a really unique, really interesting
[18:23.040 --> 18:23.360]  grow.
[18:25.040 --> 18:26.160]  What gave you this idea, man?
[18:26.160 --> 18:27.760]  Was it something you thought of or was it?
[18:28.480 --> 18:35.680]  I've seen things in the past where people will show me experimental stuff and they're
[18:35.680 --> 18:41.280]  like, hey, this one company tried these grow dam blocks in this circular thing around HBS.
[18:41.280 --> 18:42.080]  I've seen that.
[18:42.080 --> 18:42.720]  I've seen those.
[18:42.720 --> 18:45.040]  Like the Ferris wheel or something like that, the Gravitron.
[18:45.040 --> 18:45.280]  Yeah.
[18:45.280 --> 18:47.200]  And they've got it doing a rotation thing.
[18:48.960 --> 18:53.840]  I've always grown traditionally and I had a chance to do something kind of different.
[18:53.840 --> 18:56.640]  And I was like, I want to do some experimenting.
[18:56.640 --> 19:01.280]  So I took this concept that I saw in these pictures and basically just wanted to make
[19:01.280 --> 19:01.840]  it my own.
[19:01.920 --> 19:06.880]  You know, okay, I'm going to figure out a style using this method that's going to work
[19:06.880 --> 19:07.200]  for me.
[19:08.480 --> 19:09.840]  So I had a 10 by 10 room.
[19:10.640 --> 19:13.360]  Colorado, you're limited to six plants.
[19:15.360 --> 19:19.680]  The beauty of this is you can actually bed your plants to be monsters.
[19:19.680 --> 19:25.920]  Instead of having a bunch of small plants, what I wanted to do was stick to completely
[19:25.920 --> 19:26.240]  legal.
[19:26.800 --> 19:30.000]  I want to keep the plants, my numbers right.
[19:30.000 --> 19:33.920]  So I don't get rated or, you know, they say how many we can have, but they don't say how
[19:33.920 --> 19:34.800]  big they can be.
[19:34.800 --> 19:35.440]  That's right.
[19:35.440 --> 19:40.320]  So, you know, I kind of took that as, well, you know, they don't want me to have a lot
[19:40.320 --> 19:40.720]  of plants.
[19:40.720 --> 19:43.120]  I'll just make some monsters instead.
[19:43.120 --> 19:47.840]  So a lot of people told me, they said, you know, it looks like you're growing outdoor
[19:47.840 --> 19:48.240]  indoor.
[19:48.880 --> 19:52.640]  It's kind of what those plants, I saw them, I saw them right at the start of flower and
[19:52.640 --> 19:53.840]  kind of mid flower, I think.
[19:53.840 --> 19:55.840]  And it did, they have that outdoor plant shape.
[19:56.400 --> 19:56.800]  Yeah.
[19:56.800 --> 20:04.000]  And what I found was as the plants are around this light, it gives you a 45 degree kind
[20:04.000 --> 20:07.280]  of angle that you're getting on your lowers as well.
[20:07.840 --> 20:15.440]  And you can actually, you can actually get more density on all of your lower stuff and
[20:15.440 --> 20:17.840]  leave some of that to become tops on the inner side.
[20:19.120 --> 20:23.040]  So since I don't have to have my light reflecting off of a reflector and then coming down,
[20:23.920 --> 20:27.360]  and also I've got the bulb facing the other way, you're thinking I can get more, you got
[20:27.360 --> 20:28.800]  more growth out of your bottom stuff.
[20:28.800 --> 20:31.120]  So you don't have to lollipop and pinch and prune so much.
[20:31.680 --> 20:31.920]  Yeah.
[20:31.920 --> 20:37.360]  The light penetration at an angle, instead of being straight above your canopy where your
[20:37.360 --> 20:42.160]  leaves are flat, actually offers you more light penetration throughout the whole plant.
[20:42.160 --> 20:46.960]  So what I got was density, dense, thick nugs all the way down to the bottoms.
[20:46.960 --> 20:50.560]  Did you increase your overall harvest weight from your traditional style of growing?
[20:50.560 --> 20:51.360]  Yeah, actually.
[20:52.240 --> 20:58.640]  I did the same number of plants in a couple of tents a while back and I added an extra
[20:58.640 --> 21:01.200]  six ounces to what I harvested from that.
[21:01.200 --> 21:03.520]  Everybody can use an extra six ounces.
[21:03.520 --> 21:04.800]  He said extra six ounces.
[21:04.800 --> 21:07.040]  You guys, anybody else got extra six ounces?
[21:07.040 --> 21:07.680]  You know, yeah.
[21:07.680 --> 21:09.120]  That's kind of a weird thing to say.
[21:09.120 --> 21:11.280]  You know, it's not some crazy number.
[21:11.280 --> 21:11.680]  I'm not, you know.
[21:11.680 --> 21:14.640]  Colorado problems, but extra six ounces under one light.
[21:14.640 --> 21:16.560]  Hey, that's, we'll all take it.
[21:16.560 --> 21:22.880]  And you know, it also allows you to still get dense, big nugs on your lowers, but also
[21:22.880 --> 21:28.640]  reduce the chance of you getting bud rot because, you know, if you focus too much of your upper
[21:28.640 --> 21:33.440]  growth, a lot of times with dense nugs, you're going to be throwing out, you know, maybe
[21:33.440 --> 21:34.480]  a third of your product.
[21:35.120 --> 21:39.200]  People don't realize that, people always want to see big giant buds, but they don't realize
[21:39.200 --> 21:43.840]  that when you have giant buds, there's that risk of bud rot right up the center of it,
[21:43.840 --> 21:49.120]  especially in Colorado when we've got these crazy temperature swings, humidity swings
[21:49.120 --> 21:49.600]  and spikes.
[21:49.600 --> 21:54.160]  And then in large environments where we have less airflow and less control, we create micro
[21:54.160 --> 21:54.560]  climates.
[21:54.560 --> 21:56.880]  And some of our hundred, you got a hundred lights in a room.
[21:56.880 --> 21:58.160]  That's a big space.
[21:58.160 --> 22:02.160]  Every 10 by 10 section is a different kind of climate if you don't have enough airflow.
[22:02.160 --> 22:04.320]  So you can get some bud rot going in there with those big old buds.
[22:04.320 --> 22:04.960]  That's for sure.
[22:05.680 --> 22:06.240]  Oh yeah.
[22:06.240 --> 22:11.680]  And so is it, it's a way that you can reduce the chance, you know, if you didn't, if you
[22:11.680 --> 22:16.800]  know that strain in particular gets bud rot or, you know, develops colds that are going to
[22:16.800 --> 22:20.320]  be huge, you know, you can leave on more of the lowers.
[22:20.320 --> 22:21.920]  It'll reduce some of that.
[22:21.920 --> 22:24.800]  And you're going to get the density in those lowers because of the angle.
[22:24.800 --> 22:25.120]  Sweet.
[22:25.120 --> 22:25.920]  Very cool.
[22:25.920 --> 22:28.080]  It's kind of a neat little trick.
[22:28.720 --> 22:30.400]  So you did, what size pots were you using?
[22:31.120 --> 22:32.320]  I did five gallons.
[22:32.880 --> 22:37.440]  But I'd honestly recommend if you're going to bed your plants out to be like six foot
[22:37.440 --> 22:39.360]  monsters, probably going to seven or 10.
[22:39.440 --> 22:39.840]  Yeah.
[22:39.840 --> 22:41.840]  I like sevens for something like that would have been ideal.
[22:41.840 --> 22:42.480]  I saw your plants.
[22:42.480 --> 22:45.760]  I think a seven would have made them much happier, but I mean, you got to live and learn.
[22:45.760 --> 22:46.400]  Yeah.
[22:46.400 --> 22:47.200]  Was it a struggle?
[22:48.000 --> 22:49.040]  You didn't have a trellis in there.
[22:49.040 --> 22:50.400]  You had sticks holding them up, right?
[22:50.400 --> 22:53.440]  Was it a struggle to get in there and work in that room once it started going?
[22:54.080 --> 23:00.960]  No, actually because of them being in a circle, it allows me to walk on the outside of the
[23:00.960 --> 23:06.160]  plants, which makes watering super easy and they grow inwards.
[23:06.160 --> 23:07.920]  So what they do is they all lean.
[23:07.920 --> 23:11.600]  So it gives you plenty of walking space around them on the outside.
[23:11.600 --> 23:12.240]  That's pretty neat.
[23:12.240 --> 23:16.000]  So you've got, it gets even more stadium like as it goes, they all start leaning inward
[23:16.000 --> 23:16.720]  toward the light.
[23:16.720 --> 23:17.520]  All right.
[23:17.520 --> 23:18.960]  Did you do much defoliation?
[23:18.960 --> 23:20.720]  Do you normally do much defoliation?
[23:21.760 --> 23:25.600]  I normally do quite a bit of defoliation.
[23:25.600 --> 23:29.600]  All of us commercial growers in Colorado have been trained kind of to get in there and make
[23:29.600 --> 23:30.240]  them naked.
[23:30.240 --> 23:34.160]  Strip them down, you know, day 25 or so, day 45.
[23:35.120 --> 23:38.160]  And you know, it's that standard schedule of, you know, get them.
[23:39.040 --> 23:45.360]  But what I found was you can actually get away with a little less defoliation if you
[23:45.360 --> 23:45.840]  are doing it.
[23:45.840 --> 23:47.840]  Because you've got that angled light coming in.
[23:47.840 --> 23:48.320]  Yeah.
[23:48.320 --> 23:52.000]  That and the fact that your plants are circled, so they're spread out more.
[23:53.040 --> 23:58.000]  Whereas if you're packing under a light, you're actually creating micro climates in there.
[23:58.000 --> 24:00.960]  Whether you like it or not, there's going to be spots where they're okay.
[24:00.960 --> 24:03.920]  The spot's super shady and the leaves are touching, you know.
[24:04.480 --> 24:06.560]  You develop a little spot in there.
[24:06.560 --> 24:06.880]  Oh yeah.
[24:06.880 --> 24:08.000]  A little sweat bubble.
[24:08.000 --> 24:08.320]  Yeah.
[24:08.320 --> 24:12.800]  And so when you have it circled around, you don't get that as much.
[24:12.800 --> 24:18.880]  You can actually control the spacing much easier and the airflow, you don't have micro
[24:18.880 --> 24:19.280]  climates.
[24:19.280 --> 24:19.920]  That's really cool.
[24:20.560 --> 24:24.000]  So this would be a good way for, this is a good way, you proved this.
[24:24.000 --> 24:26.400]  You had, that house didn't have very large ceilings.
[24:26.400 --> 24:27.520]  Those were normal ceilings.
[24:27.520 --> 24:29.520]  And you grew fairly tall plants.
[24:29.520 --> 24:29.760]  Yeah.
[24:29.760 --> 24:32.640]  Because you were able to get almost all the way to the ceiling, right?
[24:32.640 --> 24:34.640]  Because the light wasn't above your head.
[24:34.640 --> 24:36.480]  How high did you put that light at the end?
[24:37.440 --> 24:44.400]  I had the light up, it was probably the top of the fixture was maybe six inches from the
[24:44.400 --> 24:44.960]  roof.
[24:44.960 --> 24:45.200]  Okay.
[24:46.400 --> 24:51.200]  And I adjusted the angle to be basically as high as I could go with the little adjustable
[24:51.200 --> 24:51.680]  straps.
[24:52.320 --> 24:53.840]  It just wouldn't let me get any closer.
[24:53.840 --> 24:56.160]  There's this little four inch gap that I couldn't close.
[24:56.160 --> 24:59.280]  Those little yo-yos have that little space you can't seal up.
[24:59.280 --> 24:59.440]  Yeah.
[24:59.440 --> 25:00.160]  I know what you mean.
[25:00.160 --> 25:02.240]  And so I had it on basically the max.
[25:02.320 --> 25:04.240]  It would go, but it's great.
[25:05.760 --> 25:09.920]  The way you can do it for low ceilings is using this method.
[25:09.920 --> 25:14.400]  You don't get the vertical stretch in flower that you normally get.
[25:14.400 --> 25:15.600]  You get the inward growth.
[25:16.160 --> 25:21.920]  And getting inward growth is much more beneficial.
[25:23.280 --> 25:29.760]  You can get big plants and make the tops completely form a canopy on the inside towards your light,
[25:30.320 --> 25:31.840]  which is kind of unique.
[25:32.880 --> 25:33.760]  It's weird.
[25:33.760 --> 25:40.000]  People who've never seen a canopy form in a vertical fashion, it'll freak some growers
[25:40.000 --> 25:40.080]  out.
[25:40.080 --> 25:42.000]  They're like, what are you doing?
[25:43.280 --> 25:44.080]  I can see it in my head.
[25:44.080 --> 25:45.520]  I saw yours, so I know what it looks like.
[25:45.520 --> 25:50.000]  I didn't get to see it late in flower, but I can see it in my head.
[25:50.000 --> 25:55.680]  Would you almost consider building a, I'm thinking maybe like a chicken wire trellis?
[25:55.680 --> 25:56.320]  Yeah.
[25:56.320 --> 26:00.240]  Because you can't trellis horizontally, but you could probably trellis that vertically
[26:00.240 --> 26:01.840]  with the chicken wire type of a thing.
[26:01.840 --> 26:02.240]  Yeah.
[26:02.240 --> 26:09.280]  Honestly, if somebody wanted to try this at home, and I recommend you use, there's fencing
[26:09.280 --> 26:10.880]  that has four inch gap.
[26:10.880 --> 26:12.880]  It's like yard fencing or whatever.
[26:12.880 --> 26:14.320]  Construction zone fencing or something.
[26:14.320 --> 26:14.880]  Yeah.
[26:14.880 --> 26:18.640]  And it comes in a big roll of like 52 feet or something like that.
[26:18.640 --> 26:22.320]  And you have to cut out, but it's already because it's in a roll, it's going to make
[26:22.320 --> 26:24.640]  these nice cages.
[26:24.640 --> 26:31.200]  And what you can do is around your light, measure out a diameter of about 46 inches
[26:31.200 --> 26:32.240]  or whatever you need.
[26:32.240 --> 26:37.280]  So your distance, and you can use that and make one big circle around your light.
[26:37.840 --> 26:40.560]  Use that as a trellis, weave your plants into it.
[26:40.560 --> 26:43.680]  And on the inside will just be a solid wall of buds.
[26:43.680 --> 26:44.400]  That is pretty cool.
[26:45.120 --> 26:46.320]  That is pretty damn cool.
[26:46.880 --> 26:48.560]  How many strains did you run in this room?
[26:49.200 --> 26:50.320]  I ran two strains.
[26:50.320 --> 26:54.160]  I was going to ask if you think it'd be better to just kind of limit your strains or if you
[26:54.160 --> 26:56.560]  want to run a whole multi-strain run in there?
[26:57.200 --> 26:57.360]  Yeah.
[26:58.080 --> 27:04.560]  For plant consistency, spacing wise, you want to run pretty much the same stuff because
[27:04.560 --> 27:11.200]  one plant that pushes really wide is going to start really spacing into the skinny ones
[27:11.200 --> 27:13.440]  and you're not really maximizing what you're doing.
[27:13.440 --> 27:13.920]  All right.
[27:13.920 --> 27:17.920]  So if you guys are going to try this method, keep it down to maybe a monocrop, maybe two
[27:17.920 --> 27:18.960]  strains that are similar.
[27:18.960 --> 27:21.920]  Don't try to go OG Kush and fucking Lemon Haze.
[27:21.920 --> 27:23.200]  You're going to have problems.
[27:23.200 --> 27:23.680]  Yeah.
[27:23.920 --> 27:26.720]  You definitely want to keep it consistent through there.
[27:27.840 --> 27:35.520]  I do like it for pheno hunting though if you wanted to do that because each of your plants
[27:35.520 --> 27:36.320]  are separated.
[27:36.320 --> 27:38.320]  They're not already weaved into a trellis.
[27:38.880 --> 27:43.840]  So if you are pheno hunting and you find a problem, you can quick pull that plant out
[27:43.840 --> 27:45.280]  and not have to go, oh crap.
[27:45.280 --> 27:45.840]  You know, like...
[27:45.840 --> 27:50.400]  And for pheno hunting, they're probably smaller anyway, so you don't get as much of a jungle
[27:50.400 --> 27:51.840]  in there and you can just yank them out.
[27:51.840 --> 27:52.340]  Yeah.
[27:53.520 --> 27:57.920]  Being beside each other, it's much easier to cut them out of any kind of support system
[27:57.920 --> 27:59.600]  you've got going on in there.
[27:59.600 --> 28:03.920]  And I feel like you're more likely to notice it.
[28:03.920 --> 28:06.880]  I can tell you've worked in a commercial grow because when you started talking about cutting
[28:06.880 --> 28:08.960]  things out of a trellis, you started shaking a little.
[28:08.960 --> 28:09.440]  Oh, yeah.
[28:09.440 --> 28:12.160]  Everybody has PTSD from working with those damn trellises.
[28:12.160 --> 28:18.480]  Well, I was a harvest manager and I worked with a lot of people who wanted to work fast
[28:18.480 --> 28:20.800]  but not pay attention a lot.
[28:20.800 --> 28:26.080]  So I've been cut by razor blades trying to do that and it happens.
[28:27.120 --> 28:27.680]  Yeah, it's fun.
[28:27.680 --> 28:30.720]  Working in a commercial grow is not all it's cracked up to be sometimes.
[28:30.720 --> 28:31.280]  Yeah.
[28:31.280 --> 28:32.320]  Do it fast, do it now.
[28:32.320 --> 28:33.840]  We needed it done yesterday.
[28:33.840 --> 28:34.320]  Yeah, yeah.
[28:34.320 --> 28:34.960]  Watch your hands.
[28:37.760 --> 28:40.640]  Bro, did you run into any issues with growing like this?
[28:40.640 --> 28:41.520]  Would you have any problems?
[28:41.520 --> 28:45.120]  That if somebody's going to try this method out there from listening to the show, they're
[28:45.120 --> 28:47.280]  going to go get a light, they're going to hang it vertically, they're going to wrap
[28:47.280 --> 28:50.400]  a chicken wire cage, they're going to set plants up in a circle.
[28:50.400 --> 28:53.360]  They're going to jump the light in the middle and then they're going to weave it in.
[28:53.360 --> 28:55.520]  What kind of problems should they foresee?
[28:57.120 --> 29:03.200]  Basically, they should really do this if you're in a high humidity zone where you're
[29:03.200 --> 29:08.400]  battling that because the spacing between the plants is going to increase all the airflow
[29:08.400 --> 29:13.120]  between your plants so you don't end up with any issues with PM or anything that's going
[29:13.120 --> 29:15.040]  to cause any issues that way.
[29:15.680 --> 29:18.720]  So basically, you didn't even run into any issues this whole grow and I can see it in
[29:18.720 --> 29:23.920]  your finished product, bro, because this grape, beef, jerky, leather face smells fucking
[29:23.920 --> 29:24.880]  delicious, bro.
[29:24.880 --> 29:26.080]  I appreciate it, man.
[29:26.080 --> 29:28.880]  And yeah, no, it's a really great method for growing.
[29:29.520 --> 29:30.960]  I recommend it for a lot of things.
[29:32.000 --> 29:34.080]  I didn't run into any real issues.
[29:34.640 --> 29:37.040]  I prefer it, honestly, now that I've done it.
[29:37.040 --> 29:38.160]  I really like it.
[29:38.160 --> 29:39.600]  So that's the new way for you, huh?
[29:39.600 --> 29:39.840]  Yeah.
[29:39.840 --> 29:42.400]  Well, it's not something you see done every day.
[29:43.040 --> 29:47.280]  A lot of people have the low profile LEDs and they're kind of expensive to get into.
[29:47.280 --> 29:49.520]  And I wanted to have an option too.
[29:49.520 --> 29:55.520]  I could tell my friends like, hey, what could I get into for cheap that I have low ceilings
[29:55.520 --> 29:57.520]  and I'm not working with a lot.
[29:57.520 --> 30:01.680]  And this is a method that you can recommend to your friends like, OK, you don't have a
[30:01.680 --> 30:02.720]  big plant count.
[30:02.720 --> 30:05.760]  Well, we're going to make you some monsters and you're going to do just fine, buddy.
[30:05.760 --> 30:06.240]  Yeah.
[30:06.240 --> 30:11.680]  I've seen this method done 100 years ago, basically, in Canada, but it kind of expired.
[30:11.680 --> 30:16.080]  It disappeared once Canada stopped being super popular for their beaster buds and we started
[30:16.080 --> 30:17.520]  making our own herb here.
[30:17.520 --> 30:19.520]  I saw this method kind of dwindle off.
[30:19.520 --> 30:23.920]  And in Canada, they weren't savvy enough to use the cool tube method that you've come
[30:23.920 --> 30:24.160]  up with.
[30:24.160 --> 30:25.200]  So I think that's pretty awesome.
[30:25.200 --> 30:26.400]  You've still got ducting.
[30:26.400 --> 30:29.200]  There's still a bit of climate control by using the cool tube.
[30:29.200 --> 30:31.040]  So you don't get all that light heat in there.
[30:31.040 --> 30:32.080]  So that helps you out a lot.
[30:32.720 --> 30:33.280]  Yeah.
[30:33.280 --> 30:35.600]  Would you do this on a larger scale?
[30:35.600 --> 30:36.960]  Do you think this would be scalable?
[30:38.800 --> 30:42.880]  That's a question I've asked myself a couple of times, you know, because I've worked in
[30:42.880 --> 30:46.480]  facilities and I'm like, man, you know, would this be something we could actually bring
[30:46.480 --> 30:49.360]  or kind of actually use in a commercial setting?
[30:49.360 --> 30:56.240]  And I unfortunately think the way we have it now is the way to do it commercially.
[30:56.240 --> 31:02.320]  We're going to have to kind of keep the overhead thing going just because this is something
[31:02.320 --> 31:08.160]  that's going to benefit somebody with low ceilings or who is space reduced.
[31:08.880 --> 31:09.120]  Yeah.
[31:09.120 --> 31:09.600]  The point.
[31:09.600 --> 31:11.120]  Your room was perfect for this.
[31:11.120 --> 31:12.400]  You have the best room.
[31:12.400 --> 31:15.360]  I was like, man, you could do four thousands in here or you could do that.
[31:15.360 --> 31:16.960]  And I think you made the right move.
[31:16.960 --> 31:17.280]  Yeah.
[31:17.280 --> 31:22.000]  You know, it's maximizing what one light can do for you as well.
[31:22.000 --> 31:27.120]  You know, I see guys, you know, pack a room out with four lights and, you know, they don't
[31:27.120 --> 31:30.880]  consider the input costs, you know, okay, now you're running four lights.
[31:30.880 --> 31:32.960]  Your electricity bill is going to be a lot higher.
[31:32.960 --> 31:36.000]  That house where you are wouldn't run four thousands in a bedroom.
[31:36.000 --> 31:38.400]  You'd know every breaker in that neighborhood.
[31:38.400 --> 31:39.840]  15 amp breakers, bro.
[31:39.840 --> 31:40.160]  Yeah.
[31:40.720 --> 31:44.240]  And I just know that because I know that that's an old, old part of town and the doorways
[31:44.240 --> 31:45.200]  aren't tall enough for me.
[31:45.200 --> 31:48.320]  I have to duck to go through those doorways is how old that part of town is.
[31:48.320 --> 31:48.640]  Yeah.
[31:48.640 --> 31:49.440]  No electricity.
[31:49.440 --> 31:50.160]  You'll be blowing it up.
[31:50.160 --> 31:52.640]  I think a thousand or two is your limit in that house.
[31:52.640 --> 31:52.800]  Yeah.
[31:52.800 --> 31:54.080]  That was an issue.
[31:54.080 --> 31:57.520]  I spent a lot of time crawling under the house and running wires to make that work.
[31:58.640 --> 31:59.280]  Allegedly.
[31:59.280 --> 32:00.000]  Allegedly.
[32:00.000 --> 32:00.320]  Yeah.
[32:00.320 --> 32:00.560]  Yeah.
[32:00.560 --> 32:01.040]  No worries.
[32:01.040 --> 32:02.160]  You're double door dank today.
[32:02.160 --> 32:03.360]  That's a fictional character.
[32:03.360 --> 32:04.560]  Nobody tell my landlords.
[32:04.560 --> 32:04.720]  Yeah.
[32:04.720 --> 32:05.440]  We don't know him.
[32:05.440 --> 32:07.440]  Hey, bro, in this town, he doesn't care.
[32:07.440 --> 32:08.160]  He got rent.
[32:08.160 --> 32:10.480]  Nobody stole the copper wires or the copper pipes.
[32:10.480 --> 32:11.520]  He's fucking satisfied.
[32:12.080 --> 32:15.360]  Every day I come home that, you know, like it's just all still there.
[32:15.360 --> 32:16.800]  I'm like, yeah, we're good.
[32:16.800 --> 32:17.600]  We're good, man.
[32:17.600 --> 32:18.080]  Yeah.
[32:18.080 --> 32:22.320]  Nothing to say bad about this town, but sometimes when your shit is still there, that's all you
[32:22.320 --> 32:24.000]  needed to see is, oh, it's still there.
[32:24.000 --> 32:28.080]  It just feels good around here sometimes because sometimes it might not still be there.
[32:28.080 --> 32:28.320]  Yeah.
[32:28.320 --> 32:31.680]  You know, I have a, yeah, no, I shouldn't say that on there.
[32:31.680 --> 32:33.040]  I have a sliding glass door, right?
[32:33.040 --> 32:34.320]  That'd be a terrible idea.
[32:34.320 --> 32:34.960]  You don't live there anymore.
[32:34.960 --> 32:35.520]  Allegedly.
[32:35.520 --> 32:35.920]  Yeah.
[32:35.920 --> 32:36.240]  Oh, yeah.
[32:36.240 --> 32:36.720]  That's fine.
[32:36.720 --> 32:37.040]  Oh, yeah.
[32:37.040 --> 32:37.440]  That's right.
[32:37.440 --> 32:37.840]  I'm moving.
[32:38.080 --> 32:38.320]  Yeah.
[32:38.880 --> 32:42.720]  I have my old place had a sliding glass door, which, you know, used to make me paranoid as
[32:42.720 --> 32:45.040]  crap, you know, especially being around here.
[32:45.040 --> 32:47.760]  Cause I'm like, wow, you needed a big dog, bro.
[32:47.760 --> 32:50.560]  A big rock separated them and all my stuff.
[32:53.200 --> 32:55.760]  But no, I do love it here.
[32:55.760 --> 32:57.120]  The industry is doing great.
[32:57.120 --> 32:59.360]  They're doing a lot of things to try to fix up Pueblo.
[33:00.000 --> 33:05.840]  The city center is growing and everywhere you drive, dispensary had sponsored the roads.
[33:05.920 --> 33:09.360]  And I think that's important to recognize in Colorado.
[33:09.360 --> 33:14.640]  I'm glad that you said that because I talk a lot about how the legal cannabis has changed
[33:14.640 --> 33:15.040]  this town.
[33:15.040 --> 33:16.800]  I've lived here since I was a teenager.
[33:16.800 --> 33:17.200]  I've been here.
[33:17.200 --> 33:19.840]  I turned 15 here and I'm 40 now.
[33:19.840 --> 33:20.720]  So I've been here for quite a while.
[33:20.720 --> 33:22.240]  I've left and come back a few times.
[33:22.240 --> 33:24.480]  It was in Lawrence, Kansas for a little while.
[33:24.480 --> 33:26.080]  I've been in New Mexico for a little bit.
[33:26.080 --> 33:31.120]  I've gone some places, but I've seen it go from just a town with nothing but bars and
[33:31.120 --> 33:34.160]  a steel mill to an actual blossoming place.
[33:34.160 --> 33:35.520]  It's kind of a cool little place now.
[33:36.160 --> 33:38.480]  Before you couldn't eat anything after eight o'clock.
[33:38.480 --> 33:39.440]  And now we've got Grubhub.
[33:39.440 --> 33:40.560]  It's one in the morning.
[33:40.560 --> 33:42.800]  I could Grubhub some good food now.
[33:42.800 --> 33:44.800]  And that's the cannabis industry's fault.
[33:44.800 --> 33:47.600]  The cannabis industry brought more job opportunities.
[33:47.600 --> 33:53.920]  It brought a working wage for a demographic that didn't really have an opportunity here.
[33:53.920 --> 33:59.920]  The 22 to 30 year old dudes and bros that were kind of fucked, that probably would have
[33:59.920 --> 34:04.560]  been selling drugs and committing crimes or on unemployment or working at the fucking
[34:04.560 --> 34:05.840]  mill, breaking their back.
[34:05.840 --> 34:07.840]  Now they get to grow cannabis in a legal...
[34:07.840 --> 34:08.800]  They would have been growing anyway.
[34:08.800 --> 34:10.960]  That showed a black market, most of them.
[34:10.960 --> 34:15.280]  A lot of the black market growers, hands raised, we all went right to that legal industry as
[34:15.280 --> 34:16.800]  soon as it was fucking ready.
[34:16.800 --> 34:18.000]  But it gave us opportunity.
[34:18.000 --> 34:20.160]  It gave the working class opportunity.
[34:20.160 --> 34:22.640]  Then that brought owners and investors.
[34:22.640 --> 34:27.440]  People all over the nation and world wanted to open grows and dispensaries and extraction
[34:27.440 --> 34:30.560]  labs and edible kitchens and whatever else they could get involved in.
[34:30.560 --> 34:32.960]  So people with a little bit of money came from Denver.
[34:32.960 --> 34:35.200]  They came from wherever, Portugal.
[34:35.200 --> 34:36.080]  I'm just picking places.
[34:36.080 --> 34:37.440]  They brought some money here.
[34:37.440 --> 34:41.360]  The owners and the investors have some bucks and they want to go to dinner too.
[34:41.360 --> 34:43.120]  Their wives want to go shopping also.
[34:43.120 --> 34:44.720]  They need to get their nails done.
[34:44.720 --> 34:47.520]  So that brought the demand for better shit here.
[34:47.520 --> 34:50.000]  Then the other tier up above them.
[34:50.000 --> 34:51.120]  So I guess those were the owners.
[34:51.120 --> 34:54.800]  Then the investors, they want to come here too and visit and see what's going on at the
[34:54.800 --> 34:55.280]  grows.
[34:55.280 --> 34:57.840]  So that got everything another step improved.
[34:57.840 --> 35:00.880]  I see it growing every, I don't know, I guess every quarter.
[35:00.880 --> 35:03.840]  You can see that there's a little bit of expansion here and it's cleaned up.
[35:03.840 --> 35:07.920]  Like you said, the dispensaries, when you drive down the highway and the streets, you
[35:07.920 --> 35:12.720]  see this portion of the highway is sponsored by, and I don't want to pick any dispensary
[35:12.720 --> 35:14.240]  because nobody paid for advertising.
[35:14.240 --> 35:16.800]  This portion of the highway is sponsored by Iree Genetics.
[35:16.800 --> 35:21.360]  So team Iree Genetics was out there in a fucking glow in the dark vest cleaning up the fucking
[35:21.360 --> 35:22.080]  highway one day.
[35:22.080 --> 35:23.920]  I think it's really cool that it's clean.
[35:23.920 --> 35:24.800]  It's getting cleaned up.
[35:24.880 --> 35:25.440]  It's getting better.
[35:25.440 --> 35:28.400]  We've got job opportunities and that's all from cannabis.
[35:28.400 --> 35:29.360]  You're from another place.
[35:29.360 --> 35:33.280]  You're here as part of our workforce because of cannabis, which is pretty fucking awesome.
[35:33.280 --> 35:33.840]  Yeah.
[35:33.840 --> 35:40.400]  You know, it's a different subject, but you know, it kind of makes me sad and happy at
[35:40.400 --> 35:41.040]  the same time.
[35:41.040 --> 35:45.440]  You know, a lot of people have came here and they're doing really successful now that they
[35:45.440 --> 35:47.600]  have this as an opportunity as a career.
[35:47.600 --> 35:52.560]  It makes me sad that they had to leave their home and their families to be in a state that
[35:52.560 --> 35:53.600]  allows it.
[35:53.600 --> 35:59.440]  But, you know, it makes me happy to see a lot of people thriving and doing well, such
[35:59.440 --> 36:02.960]  as yourself, you know, Rasta Jeff, the man at Iree Genetics.
[36:02.960 --> 36:04.000]  I appreciate that.
[36:04.000 --> 36:05.440]  I love that people are coming here.
[36:05.440 --> 36:11.520]  I love that we've got a blooming cannabis industry, but now this is the polite way of
[36:11.520 --> 36:12.480]  saying we're closed.
[36:12.480 --> 36:13.040]  We're full.
[36:14.400 --> 36:15.200]  Do it there.
[36:15.200 --> 36:16.160]  Do it where you are.
[36:16.160 --> 36:21.680]  If you need legal cannabis in your area, I'd love that people come here, but do it there.
[36:21.680 --> 36:22.880]  You don't have to leave.
[36:22.880 --> 36:26.400]  We took the steps here to make it happen and you can do it there.
[36:26.400 --> 36:30.720]  If you get enough people, you get enough motivation, you rally the troops, you can make cannabis
[36:30.720 --> 36:33.040]  legal where you are, then you don't have to leave.
[36:33.600 --> 36:37.680]  The majority of the states now have some sort of cannabis available to them, legal or medical,
[36:37.680 --> 36:42.000]  but you folks that don't and you folks that don't have what you want, do it the way you
[36:42.000 --> 36:44.640]  need to do it through legislation and do it there.
[36:44.640 --> 36:46.080]  If you have to move somewhere, I understand.
[36:46.080 --> 36:47.680]  Not everybody is a political activist.
[36:47.680 --> 36:50.000]  We don't all have a white mic on our team.
[36:50.000 --> 36:50.720]  Shout out to white mic.
[36:50.720 --> 36:51.920]  I wish you were here for this episode, bro.
[36:51.920 --> 36:52.640]  It would have been fun.
[36:53.600 --> 36:55.680]  You may need to do what you got to do there.
[36:55.680 --> 36:57.360]  Not everybody needs to move.
[36:57.360 --> 36:58.560]  Not everybody needs to uproot.
[36:58.560 --> 36:59.200]  I get it.
[36:59.200 --> 37:01.440]  Some people have a sick kid that needs fucking medicine today.
[37:01.440 --> 37:03.920]  They can't wait for legalization and legislation to pass.
[37:03.920 --> 37:06.240]  That kid's having fucking seizures and it's miserable.
[37:06.240 --> 37:07.040]  Get them to Colorado.
[37:07.040 --> 37:08.400]  Let's get them taken care of.
[37:08.400 --> 37:13.840]  But if you are okay, let's try to work on it where you are so we can get all the entire
[37:13.840 --> 37:18.960]  nation legalized and then we can get some sort of nationwide fucking legalization going
[37:18.960 --> 37:21.360]  instead of just state to state fucking chaos.
[37:21.920 --> 37:23.280]  Yeah, I definitely agree.
[37:23.280 --> 37:28.640]  And if you're thinking about coming to Colorado for being in the industry, I heard Oklahoma
[37:28.640 --> 37:29.120]  is great.
[37:31.120 --> 37:35.040]  Unless you're in love with mountains or something, I would almost suggest Oklahoma over here
[37:35.040 --> 37:36.480]  right now because it's brand new.
[37:38.160 --> 37:39.360]  I'm not even trying to be rude.
[37:39.360 --> 37:40.080]  We're full here.
[37:40.080 --> 37:42.240]  It's hard to get a job in the cannabis industry.
[37:42.240 --> 37:44.000]  It's also hard to get a house here.
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.480]  It's hard to get a parking space here.
[37:46.480 --> 37:48.240]  It's filling up quickly.
[37:49.120 --> 37:55.600]  Also, with Oklahoma opening up, there is a lot of companies who are jumping there right
[37:55.600 --> 37:57.920]  now and it's a lot more opportunity here.
[37:58.640 --> 38:00.160]  The market's been open for a while.
[38:02.320 --> 38:04.640]  You're not going to make a big dent in a market that's-
[38:04.640 --> 38:05.120]  Right.
[38:06.080 --> 38:10.960]  Unfortunately, I hate to say this, unless you know somebody now here, it's hard to get
[38:10.960 --> 38:11.120]  in.
[38:12.320 --> 38:14.960]  It's not what you know, it's who you know here, unfortunately.
[38:15.040 --> 38:16.720]  Oklahoma's got a lot more opportunity.
[38:18.960 --> 38:20.720]  Also, you can get a bank account in Oklahoma.
[38:20.720 --> 38:23.200]  If you move here and you try to open up a bank account, they go, where do you work?
[38:23.200 --> 38:24.800]  And I go, I work at this dispensary.
[38:24.800 --> 38:26.400]  They go, oh, then get the fuck out of our bank.
[38:26.400 --> 38:27.600]  We don't mess with you stoners.
[38:28.320 --> 38:29.520]  Oklahoma may be easier.
[38:29.520 --> 38:30.880]  I'm not trying to discourage anybody.
[38:30.880 --> 38:32.000]  Come hang out in Colorado.
[38:32.000 --> 38:34.160]  It's expensive and it's hard here and it snows.
[38:34.160 --> 38:34.720]  Yeah.
[38:35.600 --> 38:43.520]  It's a beautiful place and there's a lot of great places that are also opening up legalization
[38:43.520 --> 38:43.840]  as well.
[38:45.520 --> 38:47.840]  It's going to be a little harder.
[38:47.840 --> 38:55.440]  Our industry right now is kind of at the point where it's going to be less easy to get a
[38:55.440 --> 39:01.200]  great paying job starting out in the industry where a while back it was starting a little
[39:01.200 --> 39:01.520]  higher.
[39:02.960 --> 39:07.840]  Unfortunately, the way that the industry has gone, and this is the way that any standardized
[39:07.840 --> 39:12.960]  commercial industry goes, mostly the reason why cannabis was expensive is because it was
[39:12.960 --> 39:13.600]  illegal.
[39:13.600 --> 39:14.960]  It's not illegal anymore.
[39:14.960 --> 39:19.440]  Now we open businesses and build large-scale cultivation facilities and we produce countless
[39:19.440 --> 39:21.760]  fucking grams and we have employees and payroll.
[39:21.760 --> 39:25.280]  So the value of the product has quickly gone down.
[39:25.280 --> 39:29.520]  Then we opened too many stores and that made the value of the product quickly go down.
[39:29.520 --> 39:30.080]  It's everywhere.
[39:30.640 --> 39:35.680]  I can drive four miles in any direction from here and there's a dispensary with acceptable
[39:35.680 --> 39:36.000]  product.
[39:36.000 --> 39:37.360]  I'm not going to say it's top shelf.
[39:37.360 --> 39:41.040]  Bro, there's plenty of fucking top shelf fire on my fucking table right now.
[39:41.600 --> 39:42.880]  But this stuff used to be illegal.
[39:42.880 --> 39:44.320]  It used to be worth a lot more money.
[39:44.320 --> 39:47.760]  This jar back in the day when I first got to Colorado, 400 bucks.
[39:47.760 --> 39:50.240]  Today, you'd be lucky to get $100 for that jar.
[39:50.240 --> 39:51.840]  And I'm not even disrespecting your product.
[39:51.840 --> 39:55.600]  That's just, there's so much herb and there's so much supply that the demand is like, no,
[39:55.600 --> 39:56.560]  I've got weed, bro.
[39:56.560 --> 39:58.640]  I don't need to give you $400 for anything.
[39:58.640 --> 40:02.400]  I can get an ounce for $100 and it'll work in my pipe just fine.
[40:02.400 --> 40:04.160]  So now the value is not there.
[40:04.160 --> 40:09.360]  So now we're not making any money at the commercial facilities because we have to make every single
[40:09.360 --> 40:10.000]  gram count.
[40:10.000 --> 40:12.880]  So you got to get rid of every employee that's not pulling their weight.
[40:12.880 --> 40:13.680]  You need trimmers.
[40:13.680 --> 40:16.000]  They can just fucking trim like savage machines.
[40:16.000 --> 40:19.120]  We need fucking joint rollers that can roll like savage machines.
[40:19.120 --> 40:20.160]  There's no money in it.
[40:20.160 --> 40:23.120]  So now that there's no money in it, how am I going to pay the growers any money?
[40:23.120 --> 40:24.640]  How do I pay the trimmers any money?
[40:24.640 --> 40:30.080]  The only people that make any money are the people with the word head or lead or manager
[40:30.080 --> 40:31.760]  in the front of their title or at the end of their title.
[40:31.760 --> 40:35.840]  They're the only ones that are actually making a decent salary at this point, the lead grower,
[40:35.840 --> 40:38.080]  the master grower, he's probably doing all right.
[40:38.080 --> 40:42.000]  He's making like maybe Porsche money, but everybody else is making fucking Corolla money
[40:42.000 --> 40:42.720]  in that facility.
[40:42.720 --> 40:43.360]  Yeah.
[40:43.360 --> 40:47.200]  And I think that's why it's important to just take pride in what we're doing here.
[40:47.200 --> 40:52.720]  And if you come to the state, just know that there's a lot of people with badges and it
[40:52.720 --> 40:58.560]  is going to be probably not start out as high as you thought it was going to be in the industry,
[41:00.240 --> 41:01.360]  but you can do well.
[41:01.360 --> 41:05.280]  And if this is something you want to be a part of in your life and growing and stuff
[41:05.280 --> 41:07.200]  like that, Colorado is a great place.
[41:07.200 --> 41:12.160]  But make sure you're like Jeff said, change the laws in your own town.
[41:12.160 --> 41:12.640]  Yeah.
[41:13.520 --> 41:17.680]  And I don't mean to sound like we're full, stay out, but bro, it's getting crowded.
[41:17.680 --> 41:19.360]  I-25 is no fun.
[41:19.360 --> 41:19.600]  Yeah.
[41:19.600 --> 41:24.240]  Well, the more advocates too, that there are out there, the more people trying to make
[41:24.240 --> 41:27.520]  changes, the more we can actually make a difference.
[41:27.520 --> 41:32.640]  My grandfather was on city council in a city I won't name for his sake.
[41:33.120 --> 41:37.680]  But one of the things he tells me all the time is, we can make a lot of changes in this
[41:37.680 --> 41:40.320]  town, but people don't actually show up to the meetings.
[41:40.320 --> 41:42.960]  They don't talk about what's important to them.
[41:42.960 --> 41:44.560]  They don't care what gets passed.
[41:44.560 --> 41:49.520]  And then so then it's just up to a council of people who get to decide whatever they
[41:49.520 --> 41:50.000]  decide.
[41:50.000 --> 41:54.560]  And we could be a part of that and suggesting things along the way.
[41:54.560 --> 41:56.480]  And I think-
[41:56.480 --> 42:01.920]  A very large part of the people who were instrumental in getting much of the medical
[42:02.000 --> 42:06.480]  marijuana stuff in place here were under the age of 30 when it was happening.
[42:06.480 --> 42:08.400]  So you don't have to be a politician.
[42:08.400 --> 42:11.120]  You don't have to be some suit wearing person.
[42:11.120 --> 42:11.680]  We did it.
[42:12.320 --> 42:13.760]  Mike and I were a large part of that.
[42:13.760 --> 42:15.200]  Mike, I'm not going to say I was a lot.
[42:15.200 --> 42:19.040]  Mike did it for me because I was too shy, too afraid to go speak out because I was doing
[42:19.040 --> 42:20.400]  the growing and trying to hide.
[42:20.400 --> 42:22.960]  But Mike was a youngster when he was doing it.
[42:22.960 --> 42:24.000]  He wasn't 30 yet.
[42:24.000 --> 42:25.600]  We weren't old people.
[42:25.600 --> 42:27.120]  We were just, we were bros.
[42:27.120 --> 42:28.240]  So anybody can do it.
[42:28.240 --> 42:31.200]  You just have to get the idea, learn how to do it.
[42:31.200 --> 42:33.200]  And they have to listen to you.
[42:33.200 --> 42:34.400]  City council has to hear you out.
[42:34.400 --> 42:36.560]  They can't kick you out because you've got dreadlocks.
[42:36.560 --> 42:36.960]  Yeah.
[42:36.960 --> 42:42.480]  And the beauty is in most states in these days have some kind of law or some kind of
[42:43.040 --> 42:44.880]  reform of medical.
[42:44.880 --> 42:50.880]  And so they're going to take you a little more serious than 10, 15 years ago when they
[42:50.880 --> 42:54.880]  would just laugh you out of probably a city council meeting if you tried to bring that
[42:54.880 --> 42:55.120]  up.
[42:55.120 --> 43:02.960]  I think we're finally at an age where if we actually showed up and made it a point, I
[43:02.960 --> 43:07.360]  think we can expect it all to be coming around.
[43:07.360 --> 43:07.680]  Yeah.
[43:07.680 --> 43:10.080]  Start a Facebook group or join the local.
[43:10.080 --> 43:13.600]  You probably can't start a Facebook group to support your local cannabis movement because
[43:13.600 --> 43:15.520]  Facebook isn't cannabis friendly at all.
[43:15.520 --> 43:20.560]  So find some other way to start a local group or join your local chapter of normal.
[43:20.560 --> 43:22.400]  Every state has a normal chapter.
[43:22.400 --> 43:25.840]  The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
[43:25.840 --> 43:29.360]  They've been fighting for cannabis legalization since the 70s.
[43:29.360 --> 43:33.840]  You see Cheech wearing a normal shirt and a couple of the Cheech and Chong shows from
[43:33.840 --> 43:34.800]  back in the day.
[43:34.800 --> 43:36.560]  They've been with us for a long time.
[43:36.560 --> 43:41.600]  Find them if you need guidance in becoming active in the cannabis activism scene.
[43:41.600 --> 43:42.400]  They will help you out.
[43:42.400 --> 43:43.440]  That's a great launchpad.
[43:43.440 --> 43:45.040]  You'll find like-minded folks.
[43:45.040 --> 43:47.760]  They may help you start a local chapter of normal.
[43:47.920 --> 43:51.120]  Once you start speaking up, stoners are really...
[43:51.760 --> 43:54.720]  We're shy until we find other stoners.
[43:54.720 --> 43:58.400]  You know when you go to work, all you're doing the first day at a new job is wondering,
[43:58.400 --> 44:00.400]  wonder if that guy smokes, wonder if that guy smokes.
[44:00.400 --> 44:01.520]  You're just looking to see.
[44:01.520 --> 44:04.880]  Everybody goes to lunch alone on the first day and you come back and you're looking to
[44:04.880 --> 44:07.440]  see who's got red eyes, who smells like herb.
[44:07.440 --> 44:09.680]  Then once you know they smoke, you're like, hey, what's up, bro?
[44:09.680 --> 44:10.720]  We're potheads together.
[44:12.080 --> 44:15.280]  That's how it will happen in the city council realm also.
[44:15.360 --> 44:18.160]  You'll go, I want to legalize weed and someone else will go, hey, me too.
[44:18.720 --> 44:19.280]  How do we do that?
[44:19.280 --> 44:20.800]  And you'll go, well, come on, I'll show you.
[44:20.800 --> 44:23.680]  And then they've probably got two or three other friends that go, you guys are going
[44:23.680 --> 44:24.640]  to legalize weed?
[44:24.640 --> 44:26.160]  I want to do that too, bro.
[44:26.160 --> 44:27.040]  And it will snowball.
[44:27.040 --> 44:30.400]  And then you'll realize there are so many people in your community that wanted to take
[44:30.400 --> 44:32.400]  some sort of action and did not know how.
[44:32.400 --> 44:33.120]  That's all it takes.
[44:33.120 --> 44:36.720]  Just with the dance, nobody wants to be the first idiot dancing.
[44:36.720 --> 44:37.520]  Go dance, bro.
[44:37.520 --> 44:38.640]  Just go shake your booty.
[44:38.640 --> 44:40.240]  Go get the city council party started.
[44:41.280 --> 44:42.160]  Yeah, dude.
[44:42.160 --> 44:47.520]  And I think it's funny too, you mentioned somebody giving you the glance.
[44:48.160 --> 44:49.200]  That was always the thing.
[44:49.200 --> 44:52.000]  You know, it's like, I know you smell like weed, man.
[44:52.640 --> 44:54.160]  Do you know you smell like weed?
[44:55.040 --> 44:57.520]  And then you're like, I know I smell like weed, man.
[44:57.520 --> 44:58.080]  You want to hit?
[44:58.800 --> 45:00.720]  You know, it was always a social interaction.
[45:01.280 --> 45:04.400]  I think people just know I smoke weed just from walking by.
[45:04.400 --> 45:06.320]  They're like, that guy probably has better weed than me.
[45:07.200 --> 45:09.760]  Yeah, it's the vibe I think I give off with my appearance.
[45:09.760 --> 45:12.160]  Yeah, and I just try to enjoy it with my friends.
[45:12.160 --> 45:17.840]  You know, I appreciate all the kind words about my weed tonight because, you know,
[45:17.840 --> 45:21.120]  honestly, it's just always fun to share it with friends.
[45:21.120 --> 45:23.280]  You know, that's kind of the important part to remember.
[45:23.280 --> 45:27.120]  You know, grow from your heart and you're just doing it for the love of it.
[45:27.120 --> 45:27.920]  That's beautiful, bro.
[45:27.920 --> 45:29.440]  That's a great spot to wrap this up, man.
[45:29.440 --> 45:30.880]  I want to thank you for coming and hanging out, dude.
[45:30.880 --> 45:32.800]  Great talk about your vertical grow.
[45:32.800 --> 45:36.160]  Do you want to share your social media or other ways that people can find you?
[45:36.160 --> 45:38.640]  Because I'm sure they've got questions they're going to ask me.
[45:38.640 --> 45:40.160]  I'm going to have to message you.
[45:40.160 --> 45:43.440]  How can people direct message you so they can learn more about your vertical grow?
[45:44.080 --> 45:48.800]  Yeah, I'm on Instagram, double door dank, not Dumbledore.
[45:48.800 --> 45:50.480]  A lot of people like to confuse that.
[45:50.480 --> 45:51.680]  I am not a wizard.
[45:51.680 --> 45:52.960]  I'm just a weed grower.
[45:53.520 --> 45:57.200]  But double door dank on Instagram and you can find me.
[45:57.200 --> 46:00.560]  And any questions you have for me, you know, feel free to shoot them over.
[46:00.560 --> 46:04.720]  I know it's kind of vague on some of the stuff, you know, in the episode,
[46:04.720 --> 46:08.400]  but I'd be more than happy to, you know, fill you in on any questions you have.
[46:09.040 --> 46:13.840]  We were vague, but it's basically hang a bulb and put plants in a circle around it.
[46:13.840 --> 46:14.960]  And it's really simple.
[46:14.960 --> 46:17.440]  That's why I'm so impressed by it, because I saw what you've done.
[46:17.440 --> 46:19.360]  I saw you told me what your harvest weight was.
[46:19.360 --> 46:22.640]  You don't have to reveal that on the show from one light, but it was impressive.
[46:22.640 --> 46:26.320]  Like I would, if you work for me, I'd go, yeah, you can keep your job.
[46:26.320 --> 46:28.640]  It would not fire you for those weights for sure.
[46:28.640 --> 46:28.960]  Yeah.
[46:28.960 --> 46:32.800]  You know, and the whole idea was just to have fun and try something I hadn't done.
[46:32.800 --> 46:37.200]  And I hope, you know, maybe you guys give it a shot too, because there are a lot of benefits
[46:38.080 --> 46:41.760]  to that method as well as just the overall experience.
[46:42.320 --> 46:43.120]  And it looks like fun.
[46:43.120 --> 46:45.200]  Everybody's hung up some lights and grown the normal way.
[46:45.200 --> 46:47.360]  It looks like a great new experiment to try.
[46:47.360 --> 46:51.280]  Expand your horizons, boys and girls, learn to do some more stuff.
[46:51.280 --> 46:52.240]  Push yourself.
[46:52.240 --> 46:55.280]  If you stay stuck in that bubble, you're just gonna be stuck in that bubble.
[46:55.280 --> 46:55.840]  Oh yeah.
[46:55.840 --> 46:56.320]  Yeah.
[46:56.320 --> 46:56.720]  All right, bro.
[46:56.720 --> 46:57.520]  I'm gonna start wrapping up the show.
[46:57.520 --> 46:58.400]  Thanks for coming and hanging out.
[46:58.400 --> 47:00.240]  You're welcome back anytime you want to come, bro.
[47:00.240 --> 47:00.480]  Yeah.

[47:46.800 --> 47:50.000]  I want to thank my buddy Double Door Dank one more last time for coming.
[47:50.000 --> 47:52.720]  I want to give a giant shout out to my buddy Tribal Gardens.
[47:52.720 --> 48:27.860]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[48:47.510 --> 48:48.870]  Perhaps you've ridden away.
[48:48.870 --> 48:53.220]  The night that's lost away.
[48:53.220 --> 48:55.060]  Huge chunks of memory.
[48:55.060 --> 48:58.980]  As I slowly confirm I'm so full of my feet.
[48:58.980 --> 48:59.940]  Got it.
[48:59.940 --> 49:00.980]  Poison.
[49:00.980 --> 49:09.910]  Poison.
[49:09.910 --> 49:42.510]  Lots of acts of grease.
[49:42.510 --> 49:46.430]  It comes a time for every man to sail the seas of cheese.
[49:46.430 --> 49:50.380]  Now I like to go out under the trees.
[49:50.380 --> 49:54.140]  Go toilet seats, dance chairs, and check out the DMV.
