[00:03.070 --> 00:26.550]  Welcome to the show Podcast World, I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[00:26.550 --> 00:30.350]  This is episode 798 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:30.350 --> 00:32.670]  I've got a fun show lined up for us.
[00:32.670 --> 00:35.590]  In this episode we're going to give away free seeds.
[00:35.590 --> 00:39.910]  That's right, I've teamed up with our friends at seedsherenow.com to give away free Irie
[00:39.910 --> 00:40.910]  Genetics seeds.
[00:40.910 --> 00:44.310]  Hang out, we'll talk more about those free seeds later in this episode.
[00:44.310 --> 00:48.870]  I do want to remind you once again that Team Irie Genetics will be at the Dude Grows Cup
[00:48.870 --> 00:51.430]  June 3rd just outside of Fort Collins, Colorado.
[00:51.430 --> 00:53.310]  I do invite you to join us.
[00:53.310 --> 00:57.470]  Come grab some beans, come join the community, come give me a fist bump, come say hi at the
[00:57.470 --> 00:59.510]  Dude Grows Cup June 3rd.
[00:59.510 --> 01:03.670]  Check out dgccup.com for all of the info to that event.
[01:03.670 --> 01:07.030]  Also I want to remind you about the sale at iredirect.com.
[01:07.030 --> 01:08.950]  The 420 sale is live.
[01:08.950 --> 01:11.950]  It is still going through the rest of this month at Irie Direct.
[01:11.950 --> 01:15.310]  There's some new shit, there's some fresh shit, and there are definitely some reduced
[01:15.310 --> 01:19.650]  prices so make sure you check out iredirect.com.
[01:19.650 --> 01:23.030]  Before we jump into the cannabis part of this podcast, I do want to give a big shout out
[01:23.030 --> 01:27.990]  to my friend Natalie Ries and Ries Nation and everybody in Natalie Ries' band.
[01:27.990 --> 01:32.590]  The past weekend I got to see Natalie Ries, I got to see three concerts and also a VIP
[01:32.590 --> 01:36.470]  private party where I was treated like a rock star, where I was treated like family.
[01:36.470 --> 01:40.430]  So big shout out to Natalie Ries and the entire Ries Nation, the Ries crew.
[01:40.430 --> 01:44.530]  You guys, if you are not already listening to or following Natalie Ries, I highly recommend
[01:44.530 --> 01:48.590]  you put some of that into your life, put some of that energy into your music.
[01:48.590 --> 01:49.890]  Go check out Natalie Ries.
[01:49.890 --> 01:50.890]  That's enough of that.
[01:50.890 --> 01:55.230]  Just wanted to make sure to give them all a great big shout out and a big fist bump.
[01:55.230 --> 01:57.990]  Much love, much respect to Ries Nation.
[01:57.990 --> 02:01.190]  Alright now let's jump into the cannabis related part of this podcast.
[02:01.510 --> 02:03.510]  I do have a message here in front of me.
[02:03.510 --> 02:06.630]  This one came from my friend Richard and it goes a little bit like this.
[02:06.630 --> 02:08.390]  It says, hello Rasta Jeff.
[02:08.390 --> 02:09.830]  I love the podcast.
[02:09.830 --> 02:12.790]  By the way, you have taught this old gorilla grower so much.
[02:12.790 --> 02:15.470]  And it goes on, it says, I do have a question.
[02:15.470 --> 02:19.390]  How can I access the descriptions of your strains on iRedirect?
[02:19.390 --> 02:22.270]  Thank you for your contributions to make the world a better place.
[02:22.270 --> 02:23.790]  You give me hope for humanity.
[02:23.790 --> 02:25.550]  Alright, that is a very good question.
[02:25.550 --> 02:28.710]  Also thank you for the compliments on the hope for the humanity and it's awesome to
[02:28.710 --> 02:32.270]  know that I've taught an old gorilla grower a lot of tricks.
[02:32.270 --> 02:34.630]  Thank you for learning and listening and watching.
[02:34.630 --> 02:35.950]  Now let's talk about this question.
[02:35.950 --> 02:40.310]  The question here is, how can I access the descriptions to your strains which are available
[02:40.310 --> 02:41.510]  on iRedirect?
[02:41.510 --> 02:42.950]  That's a really good question.
[02:42.950 --> 02:47.310]  If you go to iRedirect.com to buy seeds, you'll notice there are not a lot of photos.
[02:47.310 --> 02:49.230]  There are not a lot of descriptions there.
[02:49.230 --> 02:53.630]  I cannot put those photos and descriptions on the sales page that accepts a credit card.
[02:53.630 --> 02:57.330]  The credit card processors do not like too many details there.
[02:57.330 --> 03:01.610]  They just want it to say a strain name and some seeds and if it's reg or fem and a price
[03:01.610 --> 03:04.690]  is basically all the info they want up there on the page.
[03:04.690 --> 03:06.690]  I do have another page.
[03:06.690 --> 03:10.690]  iRegenetics.com is my main website where everything is hosted.
[03:10.690 --> 03:11.690]  The Discord is there.
[03:11.690 --> 03:14.010]  The podcast is there.
[03:14.010 --> 03:17.370]  Links to all of the strain descriptions are there on that website.
[03:17.370 --> 03:20.730]  You can go to iRegenetics.com, click on genetics.
[03:20.730 --> 03:24.770]  It'll take you to regular or feminized and you can go and read a lot of details about
[03:24.770 --> 03:26.810]  the strains there on the website.
[03:26.810 --> 03:30.030]  That is of course a forever evolving work in progress.
[03:30.030 --> 03:31.530]  Some strains have not been updated.
[03:31.530 --> 03:33.170]  Some have been heavily updated.
[03:33.170 --> 03:36.570]  There's a lot of details there on iRegenetics.com.
[03:36.570 --> 03:40.850]  Another great option is to join the Discord and you can find a Discord link on iRegenetics.com.
[03:40.850 --> 03:45.850]  Actually, hey, Webguy, if you're listening to this, we may need to update the link on
[03:45.850 --> 03:46.850]  Discord.
[03:46.850 --> 03:48.010]  I'm not sure if that link works.
[03:48.010 --> 03:49.010]  It may have expired.
[03:49.010 --> 03:50.090]  We may need to fix that.
[03:50.090 --> 03:51.090]  He watches the show.
[03:51.090 --> 03:54.730]  This may be a good way to get him a message and if not, it will remind me when I do some
[03:54.730 --> 03:55.730]  editing.
[03:55.730 --> 03:56.850]  I may need to cut that out.
[03:56.850 --> 03:58.050]  But there is a Discord.
[03:58.050 --> 04:01.770]  If you go to iRegenetics.com, there will be a link to the Discord server.
[04:01.770 --> 04:05.210]  On that Discord server, there are a lot of photos of the plants being grown.
[04:05.210 --> 04:09.330]  On the left tab, if you scroll down, there will be a tab for every strain that I have
[04:09.330 --> 04:10.330]  put out.
[04:10.330 --> 04:13.490]  It'll start with the rise and it goes all the way down to whatever the last alphabetical
[04:13.490 --> 04:14.490]  one is.
[04:14.490 --> 04:17.650]  There are a lot of strains listed there on the Discord server.
[04:17.650 --> 04:20.490]  Those are updated by people growing those strains.
[04:20.490 --> 04:22.770]  That's not just done by me, by the Webguy.
[04:22.770 --> 04:27.370]  That is an open source, a community sourced platform where everybody growing that strain
[04:27.370 --> 04:30.890]  is free to go and post their reviews, their pictures, their experiences.
[04:30.890 --> 04:31.890]  They can ask questions.
[04:31.890 --> 04:33.290]  They can tell you details.
[04:33.290 --> 04:38.090]  So if you want more info, my first recommendation is to check out iRegenetics.com.
[04:38.090 --> 04:41.610]  Then after that, I would recommend checking out the Discord server where you can get a
[04:41.610 --> 04:43.410]  lot of extra information.
[04:43.410 --> 04:48.370]  Also, since we're talking about it, if you go to iRegenetics.com and you notice that
[04:48.370 --> 04:52.930]  one of the strains listed in the strain section does not have a high quality photo, if you
[04:52.930 --> 04:57.050]  happen to have a high quality photo of that strain, send me that picture.
[04:57.050 --> 05:00.150]  Also make sure to label it so I know which strain that is.
[05:00.150 --> 05:01.150]  Send me your name.
[05:01.150 --> 05:04.810]  Also send me your social media so I can follow you, stalk you, and give you shout outs.
[05:04.810 --> 05:09.050]  Then most importantly, send me your address so that I can send you the gift of free seeds
[05:09.050 --> 05:11.050]  for trading me that picture for my website.
[05:11.050 --> 05:14.310]  It's always great to have high quality photos up there for advertising.
[05:14.310 --> 05:15.310]  Send me your favorite photo.
[05:15.310 --> 05:18.010]  If I do use it, I will send you a pack of seeds.
[05:18.010 --> 05:22.130]  If I use it on the website, I may just repost it to social media and give you credit.
[05:22.130 --> 05:24.050]  Still may send you seeds, but no promise there.
[05:24.050 --> 05:26.450]  If it goes on the website, you'll get a free pack of seeds.
[05:26.450 --> 05:27.730]  All right, I've been rambling.
[05:27.730 --> 05:28.730]  Where was I?
[05:28.730 --> 05:31.810]  We're talking about the descriptions on iRegenetics.com.
[05:31.810 --> 05:34.090]  Some of those descriptions will be heavily detailed.
[05:34.090 --> 05:36.210]  Some of those will not be as super detailed.
[05:36.210 --> 05:37.610]  Some of those are still evolving.
[05:37.610 --> 05:39.610]  I'm still learning about some of these strains.
[05:39.610 --> 05:43.410]  Also, some of them I posted a long time ago and forgot to add descriptions.
[05:43.410 --> 05:46.850]  So if you need a description, if there's something I've forgotten, also go ahead and send me
[05:46.850 --> 05:52.370]  a heads up and I will do my best to update those strain descriptions on iRegenetics.com.
[05:52.370 --> 05:57.890]  All right, this message came from my friend Richard and this did come from the Grow Help
[05:57.890 --> 06:01.210]  tab on iRegenetics.com, which means guess what, Richard?
[06:01.210 --> 06:02.690]  You win a free pack of seeds.
[06:02.690 --> 06:03.690]  That's right.
[06:03.690 --> 06:06.730]  On iRegenetics.com, on the top, there's a bunch of tabs.
[06:06.730 --> 06:09.810]  One of those tabs does say Grow Help or Grow Questions.
[06:09.810 --> 06:13.450]  If you click on there and send me a grow question to the podcast, if I read that question here
[06:13.450 --> 06:15.530]  on the show, you win free seeds.
[06:15.530 --> 06:19.250]  And that free seed giveaway is sponsored by seedsherenow.com.
[06:19.250 --> 06:23.170]  Big shout out to the team at seedsherenow.com for sponsoring a seed giveaway.
[06:23.170 --> 06:25.930]  But my friend Richard, please do send me your address.
[06:25.930 --> 06:29.210]  Let me know where to send a free pack of iRegenetics seeds.
[06:29.210 --> 06:31.530]  All right, let's keep the podcast moving.
[06:31.530 --> 06:34.270]  I do have plenty of great questions here in front of me.
[06:34.270 --> 06:40.010]  The next one also came from the Grow Help submission tab on iRegenetics.com.
[06:40.010 --> 06:41.890]  The name they want to be called is Nostos.
[06:41.890 --> 06:44.250]  I think I said that properly.
[06:44.250 --> 06:48.450]  They have a general grow question and the question goes a lot like this.
[06:48.450 --> 06:52.850]  It says, Dear Rasta Jeff, first and foremost, I'd like to take a quick second to thank you
[06:52.850 --> 06:58.490]  for you and the wonderful iRee Army for representing the best of what this community has to offer.
[06:58.490 --> 07:00.570]  Bro, thank you so much for noticing.
[07:00.570 --> 07:03.090]  Thank you for being a part of the iRee Army.
[07:03.090 --> 07:04.170]  You are a big part of that.
[07:04.170 --> 07:07.370]  Just sending me this letter means you are definitely iRee Army.
[07:07.370 --> 07:13.290]  It goes on to say, In our current 2023 clown world filled with inflated egos and cash hungry
[07:13.290 --> 07:18.570]  snakes, it is beautiful to know that there are still folks out there who are doing the
[07:18.570 --> 07:22.050]  good work and humbling themselves daily for the benefit of others.
[07:22.050 --> 07:26.770]  Dude, I try to make the best seeds I can and keep them affordable and grow from my heart
[07:26.770 --> 07:27.910]  and breed with love.
[07:27.910 --> 07:30.050]  So thank you for noticing exactly that.
[07:30.050 --> 07:32.970]  Yes, there are a lot of snakes and a lot of clowns out there.
[07:32.970 --> 07:35.250]  I just do my best to avoid them.
[07:35.250 --> 07:38.810]  I stay neutral, I stay peaceful, and I stay out of all the bullshit.
[07:38.810 --> 07:40.610]  Keep my head down and keep working on my growth.
[07:40.610 --> 07:42.350]  So thanks for noticing that part, bro.
[07:42.350 --> 07:43.350]  It does go on.
[07:43.350 --> 07:44.350]  There is a question.
[07:44.350 --> 07:47.210]  It says, Now my grow question with a bit of context.
[07:47.210 --> 07:48.490]  That always helps a little bit.
[07:48.490 --> 07:54.390]  Then it says, Let's say hypothetically that someone was fortunate enough to snag a pack
[07:54.390 --> 07:58.230]  of the cream, which was cookies and cream to a rise, a great strain, which has been
[07:58.230 --> 08:02.210]  worked into Big Mountain Fudge Cake and will continue that project going on.
[08:02.210 --> 08:06.450]  Anyway, it says, It says, What if I were to find an incredible phenotype from this
[08:06.450 --> 08:07.450]  F1 batch?
[08:07.450 --> 08:08.450]  Yes, that was an F1.
[08:08.450 --> 08:10.530]  The cream I made was an F1.
[08:10.530 --> 08:15.470]  What if I find an incredible phenotype from this F1 that has a strong, pungent aroma flavor
[08:15.470 --> 08:20.610]  of fresh ginger with the effects that has one laying on the floor due to intense OG
[08:20.610 --> 08:23.210]  like stoned that comes on like a tidal wave?
[08:23.210 --> 08:25.930]  Bro, that, what if hypothetically?
[08:25.930 --> 08:26.930]  Sign me up, bro.
[08:26.930 --> 08:28.610]  I would hypothetically take two of those.
[08:28.610 --> 08:33.530]  Let's turn it into dabs and see how melted into the floor we can possibly get.
[08:33.530 --> 08:34.530]  Now the message goes on.
[08:34.530 --> 08:38.810]  It says, Let's hypothetically imagine that this Fino produced less than a half a dozen
[08:38.810 --> 08:44.750]  seeds, which he labeled S1 with no noticeable issue issues of intersex or anthers during
[08:44.750 --> 08:46.410]  late flower.
[08:46.410 --> 08:50.330]  So this person has grown the cream and they have produced half a dozen seeds.
[08:50.330 --> 08:54.090]  Now when it says with no noticeable issues of intersex or anthers during late flower,
[08:54.090 --> 08:58.970]  I'm assuming right now that those plants that the seeds came from were not showing
[08:58.970 --> 09:03.210]  any noticeable issues of intersex or anthers during late flower.
[09:03.210 --> 09:07.090]  I don't think we've grown the seeds to find out what those do until the next sentence.
[09:07.090 --> 09:08.810]  In the next sentence, we do that part.
[09:08.810 --> 09:13.290]  So we had a cream plant that did not show any problems, but it did produce half a dozen
[09:13.290 --> 09:16.770]  seeds and this person labeled those seeds S1.
[09:16.770 --> 09:18.010]  I'm not sure.
[09:18.010 --> 09:19.610]  Are those S1?
[09:19.610 --> 09:20.890]  Are they F1?
[09:20.890 --> 09:21.890]  Are they R1?
[09:21.890 --> 09:23.330]  Or would we label those bag seeds?
[09:23.330 --> 09:27.410]  Since I don't know the pollen donor, those seeds in my mind in my world as a breeder,
[09:27.410 --> 09:30.250]  as somebody who puts seeds out, those become bag seed.
[09:30.250 --> 09:31.490]  I only know one parent.
[09:31.490 --> 09:33.250]  I only know one part of the equation.
[09:33.250 --> 09:37.610]  So at this point, I would not be comfortable calling it an S1 because I don't know what
[09:37.610 --> 09:39.430]  pollinated that plant.
[09:39.430 --> 09:42.990]  If it was a self-pollination, then possibly, but we don't know that.
[09:42.990 --> 09:44.130]  We didn't reverse anything.
[09:44.130 --> 09:47.250]  So there's no way to confirm that.
[09:47.250 --> 09:51.570]  It's not an F1 or it could be an F1 if something else pollinated it.
[09:52.250 --> 09:53.250]  We don't know what else is in the room.
[09:53.250 --> 09:54.890]  We don't know where the pollen could have came from.
[09:54.890 --> 09:58.930]  It definitely could be bag seed is what I would label this so far.
[09:58.930 --> 10:02.410]  I would label it the cream bag seed is what it would say on my bag if I had it with the
[10:02.410 --> 10:03.810]  date on it also.
[10:03.810 --> 10:05.250]  Now let's go into the next sentence.
[10:05.250 --> 10:09.170]  It said, now fast forward to the self seeds being grown out.
[10:09.170 --> 10:11.570]  These S1s, which I'm not sure they're S1s honestly, bro.
[10:11.570 --> 10:16.170]  These bag seeds happen to carry the ginger flavor of the aroma with a nice body stone.
[10:16.170 --> 10:17.730]  So you got some winners out of there.
[10:17.730 --> 10:18.850]  That's pretty cool.
[10:18.850 --> 10:20.570]  That's why I always say grow those bag seeds.
[10:20.570 --> 10:22.330]  You guys, you never know what you've got.
[10:22.330 --> 10:23.330]  They could be amazing.
[10:23.330 --> 10:24.330]  They could be trash.
[10:24.330 --> 10:26.210]  In this case, it looks like we've got winners.
[10:26.210 --> 10:28.410]  So now we move on to the question.
[10:28.410 --> 10:32.610]  If these S1 seeds, which we're still kind of skeptical on that, if these S1 seeds were
[10:32.610 --> 10:37.210]  hypothetically produced to produce their own set of self seeds, would these be classified
[10:37.210 --> 10:40.410]  as cream S2 or cream S1 F2?
[10:40.410 --> 10:41.770]  All right.
[10:41.770 --> 10:46.770]  I understand the question, but since we don't know what pollinated that cream plant, it's
[10:46.770 --> 10:51.370]  hard to put proper labeling onto the seeds.
[10:51.370 --> 10:53.330]  I want to call it bag seed.
[10:53.330 --> 10:54.330]  That's what this is.
[10:54.330 --> 10:56.490]  And then you've got like a bag seed.
[10:56.490 --> 10:58.570]  Let me see what the, did you self it?
[10:58.570 --> 10:59.570]  Let's see.
[10:59.570 --> 11:00.850]  Growing those out.
[11:00.850 --> 11:06.410]  If these seeds were hypothetically to produce their own seeds, you could call those self
[11:06.410 --> 11:07.490]  seeds if you want to.
[11:07.490 --> 11:10.210]  Those would be an S2 more than an S1 F2.
[11:10.210 --> 11:11.210]  That would be an S2.
[11:11.210 --> 11:13.170]  S is the indication for self.
[11:13.170 --> 11:17.910]  So I'm not sure how I would label these because I probably wouldn't continue with the bag
[11:17.910 --> 11:18.910]  seed.
[11:18.910 --> 11:22.370]  If a plant is making seeds on its own, I probably wouldn't continue that.
[11:22.370 --> 11:23.870]  That's not good for a breeder.
[11:23.870 --> 11:25.350]  That's not good for a production grower.
[11:25.350 --> 11:27.810]  This is something I would have gotten rid of.
[11:27.810 --> 11:30.970]  Probably the second time I realized it made seeds, it would disappear.
[11:30.970 --> 11:34.970]  And I don't know if I would have gotten this far with the seeds as you, but now we can
[11:34.970 --> 11:38.930]  talk a little bit about the labeling and how this would have been labeled.
[11:38.930 --> 11:44.330]  Let's say that that cookies, that that cream plant was given pollen, that we know it was
[11:44.330 --> 11:45.490]  given pollen.
[11:45.490 --> 11:50.050]  If it was given pollen by a regular plant, a regular male plant, that would make it an
[11:50.050 --> 11:51.050]  F1.
[11:51.050 --> 11:52.130]  That's a new filial generation.
[11:52.130 --> 11:56.410]  It's actually a polyhybrid, but that's a further podcast that I'm ready to have right now.
[11:56.410 --> 11:58.050]  So that would be an F1.
[11:58.050 --> 12:03.390]  If that plant was pollinated by the same plant, if we cut two clones of that cream plant and
[12:03.390 --> 12:07.490]  pollinated that plant with the same stuff, that would be selfed.
[12:07.490 --> 12:12.490]  If that plant was pollinated by anything else that was reversed, that is an R1.
[12:12.490 --> 12:13.650]  That's a reversal.
[12:13.650 --> 12:19.570]  So we changed the indication from S1 to R1 because self gets the S1, R gets the reversal
[12:19.570 --> 12:20.570]  indication.
[12:20.570 --> 12:21.570]  That's what I would do.
[12:21.570 --> 12:27.970]  Then if we take an S1, so we self a plant, you self it, S1, golden goat S1, that exists.
[12:27.970 --> 12:30.730]  I took a golden goat female and a golden goat female.
[12:30.730 --> 12:33.570]  I reversed one, made pollen, put it on the girl.
[12:33.570 --> 12:35.410]  Now I've got golden goat S1 seeds.
[12:35.410 --> 12:39.890]  If I were to pull my favorite golden goat phenotype out of there and repeat the process,
[12:39.890 --> 12:43.690]  cut clones of that one, use one as a pollen donor, one as a pollen receiver, that would
[12:43.690 --> 12:48.250]  be a golden goat S2, the second selfed generation.
[12:48.250 --> 12:52.850]  So I see what you're asking and you are correct in your thinking that it would be an S1 or
[12:52.850 --> 12:54.530]  an S2 or an F1 or an F2.
[12:54.530 --> 12:58.770]  You're correct with that thought process, but I don't want to label it that because the
[12:58.770 --> 13:01.450]  original bag seed is where it came from.
[13:01.450 --> 13:02.970]  I would call it cookies and cream.
[13:02.970 --> 13:05.090]  Bag seed would be what it started as.
[13:05.130 --> 13:08.850]  That would be its own brand new thing because I'm not certain about the pollen donor.
[13:08.850 --> 13:10.570]  There is another part to this question.
[13:10.570 --> 13:15.090]  It says, additionally, oh, this is a whole another category, a whole another branch off
[13:15.090 --> 13:16.090]  of this question.
[13:16.090 --> 13:18.450]  So I think I've answered the first part.
[13:18.450 --> 13:19.690]  We've talked about breeding labels.
[13:19.690 --> 13:22.210]  Now let's talk about the second part of this question.
[13:22.210 --> 13:27.570]  Additionally, if you could pick any land race varietal outside of the modern OG cookies
[13:27.570 --> 13:33.610]  alien gene pool to hybridize with the above project and add more stimulating narrow leaf
[13:33.610 --> 13:36.610]  buzz to it, what land race would you choose?
[13:36.610 --> 13:38.370]  That's a really good question.
[13:38.370 --> 13:41.770]  But to be frank, honestly, I wouldn't breed with this plant because it's producing seeds
[13:41.770 --> 13:44.210]  and it's going to be problematic in the future.
[13:44.210 --> 13:48.570]  But if I were to breed with the cookies and cream plant, it's got that lay you on the
[13:48.570 --> 13:50.770]  floor sort of feeling that you're talking about.
[13:50.770 --> 13:53.130]  You want to put more head buzz into it.
[13:53.130 --> 13:57.770]  I've got three options because I would want to see the phenotype that you're breeding
[13:57.770 --> 14:00.610]  with before I make my decisions and then I would narrow it down.
[14:00.610 --> 14:06.450]  But a sight unseen, I would probably pollinate that plant with a Brazilian plant.
[14:06.450 --> 14:09.330]  But the problem with Brazilian plants, they grow wild.
[14:09.330 --> 14:12.530]  They get real tall, they're branchy, they're out of control.
[14:12.530 --> 14:13.530]  They're just a fucking mess.
[14:13.530 --> 14:14.850]  They go every direction.
[14:14.850 --> 14:16.530]  They're not really tame.
[14:16.530 --> 14:18.890]  The Brazilian land races go all over the place.
[14:18.890 --> 14:22.890]  But the buzz, that fucking buzz from a Brazilian plant, it gets to your brain.
[14:22.890 --> 14:23.890]  It gets me all wild.
[14:23.890 --> 14:26.290]  It gives me that weird tunnel vision feeling.
[14:26.290 --> 14:27.530]  That would be awesome.
[14:27.530 --> 14:30.370]  The next option would probably be a tie.
[14:31.130 --> 14:35.090]  Because again, the tie is going to have a real psychedelic head buzz, that real like
[14:35.090 --> 14:38.850]  energetic euphoric sort of mind fuck sort of thing, which I really love.
[14:38.850 --> 14:41.750]  But that tie is going to be so much easier to grow than the Brazilian.
[14:41.750 --> 14:44.210]  It's going to be more uniform, more classic shaped.
[14:44.210 --> 14:49.850]  It's not going to be all over the place and branchy and stretchy and crazy like that Brazilian.
[14:49.850 --> 14:56.570]  Another option, I recently was given a Nigerian haze clone, which I've only got in veg so
[14:56.570 --> 14:58.010]  far.
[14:58.010 --> 14:59.530]  But that thing is crazy.
[14:59.690 --> 15:00.690]  It's vigorous.
[15:00.690 --> 15:02.450]  It's got a really nice structure to it.
[15:02.450 --> 15:03.730]  The leaves are beautiful.
[15:03.730 --> 15:04.930]  The stem rub smells good.
[15:04.930 --> 15:08.170]  I may consider crossing it to that Nigerian haze.
[15:08.170 --> 15:11.690]  Once again, those three, the Brazilian, the tie and the Nigerian, I know that those have
[15:11.690 --> 15:14.250]  a crazy psychedelic head buzz.
[15:14.250 --> 15:17.490]  Those plants have that kind of buzz that when you smoke it, you get that psychedelic feeling.
[15:17.490 --> 15:19.010]  You get a drum circle going.
[15:19.010 --> 15:20.010]  You get the fire going.
[15:20.010 --> 15:22.870]  And next thing you know, it's the next morning and everybody's like, hey, it was a great
[15:22.870 --> 15:23.870]  night hanging out with you.
[15:23.870 --> 15:24.870]  And you're like, where did time go?
[15:24.870 --> 15:26.170]  I've been so high.
[15:26.170 --> 15:32.690]  That sort of buzz comes from those Brazilian, the tie, the Congo, the Nigerian regions like
[15:32.690 --> 15:36.850]  that will provide that crazy, crazy buzz in my experience.
[15:36.850 --> 15:39.370]  So let's see where we are in this question.
[15:39.370 --> 15:43.530]  I probably wouldn't breed with this, but S2 is what I think you would call that there.
[15:43.530 --> 15:46.770]  I would choose Brazilian tire or Nigerian to breed with this.
[15:46.770 --> 15:48.090]  I've also got a Congo plant.
[15:48.090 --> 15:51.450]  That'd be fun to breed, but I'm keeping that a little bit on the down low for a while.
[15:51.450 --> 15:53.330]  You guys haven't seen much of my Congo work yet.
[15:53.330 --> 15:54.330]  All right.
[15:54.330 --> 15:55.330]  This message wraps up with.
[15:55.330 --> 15:59.210]  We are offering this spot on your website for those of us who choose to avoid social
[15:59.210 --> 16:00.930]  media and chat servers.
[16:00.930 --> 16:05.170]  I can respect that a lot of people out there in prohibition land don't want to be on Instagram,
[16:05.170 --> 16:08.410]  on discord, posted pictures of their ganja plants when they shouldn't be growing it at
[16:08.410 --> 16:09.410]  all.
[16:09.410 --> 16:11.730]  And I understand that the chat servers can make you a little bit paranoid.
[16:11.730 --> 16:12.730]  We try to be safe.
[16:12.730 --> 16:16.010]  We do respect the people in prohibition land, but I'm glad you were able to reach out and
[16:16.010 --> 16:17.650]  ask this great question.
[16:17.650 --> 16:21.810]  They wrap it up with love and respect from your friend from prohibition land.
[16:21.810 --> 16:24.810]  Allegedly, bro, I know you're in California where it's legal.
[16:24.810 --> 16:28.210]  They're just trying to trick us into not knowing where you are.
[16:28.210 --> 16:29.210]  My buddy, no stoves.
[16:29.210 --> 16:30.810]  I think that's how you say that.
[16:30.810 --> 16:32.370]  I owe you a pack of seeds.
[16:32.370 --> 16:33.370]  That's right.
[16:33.370 --> 16:36.370]  You win a free pack of seeds because I read your message here on the podcast.
[16:36.370 --> 16:41.290]  Once again, that free seed giveaway is sponsored by our friends at seeds here now.com.
[16:41.290 --> 16:45.230]  Make sure you check out seeds here now.com for regular feminized auto flower and photo
[16:45.230 --> 16:48.290]  period seeds and lightning fast shipping.
[16:48.290 --> 16:49.290]  All right.
[16:49.290 --> 16:50.870]  I've got another message here right in front of me.
[16:50.870 --> 16:54.790]  This one came from our friend Michael, and it goes a lot like this.
[16:55.770 --> 16:56.770]  Jeff, hey bro.
[16:56.770 --> 17:00.910]  It says, I am so happy and grateful I found your show, which was recommended in the depths
[17:00.910 --> 17:03.630]  of a Reddit cannabis.
[17:03.630 --> 17:04.630]  That is awesome.
[17:04.630 --> 17:08.870]  Big shout out to everybody out there supporting cannabis and of course supporting I read genetics
[17:08.870 --> 17:11.310]  and the grow from your heart podcast on Reddit.
[17:11.310 --> 17:15.250]  I did not realize that I had a following or a ganja community out there, but I'm glad
[17:15.250 --> 17:17.470]  somebody mentioned my podcast.
[17:17.470 --> 17:18.470]  Thank you.
[17:18.470 --> 17:20.150]  Whoever that was and or is it goes on.
[17:20.150 --> 17:24.830]  It says, I really appreciate your podcast as you knowledgeably convey expertise that
[17:24.830 --> 17:27.470]  most would take years to realize if ever.
[17:27.470 --> 17:28.470]  Wow.
[17:28.470 --> 17:29.470]  Thank you.
[17:29.470 --> 17:30.470]  That's a huge compliment.
[17:30.470 --> 17:31.470]  I feel like I've got to give this info out.
[17:31.470 --> 17:35.710]  If I didn't give out this, if I didn't share my experience and share this info, it would
[17:35.710 --> 17:38.150]  be bad karma or something and it wouldn't work.
[17:38.150 --> 17:39.150]  Right.
[17:39.150 --> 17:40.190]  So I've got to keep this going for you.
[17:40.190 --> 17:44.190]  It says Google scholar has a quote on their website that says, stand on the shoulders
[17:44.190 --> 17:48.450]  of giants and advancing my cannabis journey and improving my future grow through your
[17:48.450 --> 17:50.730]  podcast feels very much like this.
[17:50.730 --> 17:51.810]  I appreciate that bro.
[17:51.810 --> 17:52.810]  Thank you.
[17:52.810 --> 17:53.810]  Come along for the journey.
[17:53.810 --> 17:57.690]  Um, I just have ADD and I read a lot and I talk a lot, so it ends up being a podcast
[17:57.690 --> 18:00.770]  is really what's happening here and I got a lot of passion for cannabis and I want you
[18:00.770 --> 18:05.290]  guys to all grow and smoke and have access to the best ganja in the world.
[18:05.290 --> 18:09.290]  That way whenever I go to a concert and somebody lights up weed and passes it to me, I can
[18:09.290 --> 18:12.970]  smoke it with confidence cause we spread the good word and everyone's growing good ganja.
[18:12.970 --> 18:17.690]  All right, let me stay focused cause obviously whatever I smoked is fucking working.
[18:17.690 --> 18:20.610]  It says I am an American living in Germany.
[18:20.610 --> 18:23.450]  Oh, that sounds interestingly exciting.
[18:23.450 --> 18:28.370]  And Germany may very likely trial legal cannabis before full on legalization.
[18:28.370 --> 18:33.530]  For this reason, I'm planning a grow operation for both medical and recreational and exclusively
[18:33.530 --> 18:34.970]  on quality.
[18:34.970 --> 18:39.730]  My goal is to bring the ethos of the medical growers to Europe and demonstrate in Germany
[18:39.730 --> 18:42.490]  how an indoor living soil system can shine.
[18:42.490 --> 18:45.330]  Bro, this sounds like a huge, uh, awesome project.
[18:45.330 --> 18:47.670]  I'm proud of you and I wish you the best for this.
[18:47.670 --> 18:49.510]  So be safe, be careful and stay legal.
[18:49.510 --> 18:51.350]  It sounds like you're doing it right, but why?
[18:51.350 --> 18:52.430]  I wish you the best for this.
[18:52.430 --> 18:55.070]  This is hugely ambitious and I'm proud to be a part of this.
[18:55.070 --> 18:57.150]  Honestly, I feel like I'm helping you out already.
[18:57.150 --> 19:02.550]  It says I've already done Dr. Elaine Ingram's soil food web course, which was recommended
[19:02.550 --> 19:05.510]  by our friend Sean several hundred episodes ago.
[19:05.510 --> 19:08.510]  Big shout out to our buddy Sean and also big shout out to Dr. Elaine Ingram.
[19:08.510 --> 19:10.630]  Uh, Ingram, there's no R in there.
[19:10.630 --> 19:11.870]  I've been saying it wrong the whole time.
[19:11.870 --> 19:12.870]  I just read it.
[19:12.870 --> 19:13.870]  Elaine Ingram.
[19:14.070 --> 19:18.990]  Anyway, it says I'm currently tackling soil mineral balances and beneficial insect IPM
[19:18.990 --> 19:21.470]  regimens to go fully organic.
[19:21.470 --> 19:23.670]  That's hugely ambitious as well and I hope that works for you.
[19:23.670 --> 19:25.310]  I am not the organic grower.
[19:25.310 --> 19:29.310]  I find there are a whole set of different problems when it comes to growing organically,
[19:29.310 --> 19:32.390]  but I'm sure you've got a good team to help you figure that out.
[19:32.390 --> 19:36.990]  Now it does say I'm working backwards through your podcast, so I apologize if these topics
[19:36.990 --> 19:38.270]  have been covered already.
[19:38.270 --> 19:42.750]  I have about five questions about your cultivars and terpenes for you.
[19:42.750 --> 19:43.750]  This is going to get fun.
[19:43.750 --> 19:46.350]  You guys, I love talking about the strains I bred.
[19:46.350 --> 19:48.910]  Terps are one of my favorite subjects, so this is going to be good.
[19:48.910 --> 19:49.910]  This is a great message.
[19:49.910 --> 19:53.470]  Oh, and also, thank you for listening to the catalog of podcasts.
[19:53.470 --> 19:55.190]  You've got a lot to catch up on.
[19:55.190 --> 19:59.670]  You guys don't ever feel afraid to ask a question that you feel I may have answered already
[19:59.670 --> 20:00.750]  because I may have learned something.
[20:00.750 --> 20:04.750]  I may have changed my opinion, technology, equipment, something may have changed since
[20:04.750 --> 20:06.110]  the last time I talked about that.
[20:06.110 --> 20:08.070]  So feel free to ask your question.
[20:08.070 --> 20:09.390]  I may give a different answer.
[20:09.390 --> 20:11.710]  I may give a totally more in-depth answer.
[20:11.710 --> 20:15.750]  I may give a shorter answer and also not everybody listens to every episode.
[20:15.750 --> 20:18.310]  So feel free to ask your questions that you've got.
[20:18.310 --> 20:20.510]  Don't be worried about a repeat question.
[20:20.510 --> 20:21.510]  I may answer it.
[20:21.510 --> 20:22.830]  I may filter it right on out.
[20:22.830 --> 20:24.150]  Let's get to this person's questions.
[20:24.150 --> 20:29.390]  It does say as Germany will be a new market, I'm betting it will likely be initially flooded
[20:29.390 --> 20:34.630]  with flashy names like gelato and blue dream or the old school names like white widow and
[20:34.630 --> 20:37.470]  Jack hair and medium quality at best.
[20:37.470 --> 20:39.150]  That's probably going to be accurate.
[20:39.150 --> 20:42.610]  They're also going to have a lot of older folks looking for a Panama red and purple
[20:42.610 --> 20:43.610]  haze.
[20:43.610 --> 20:45.990]  All the old stoner dudes are going to want that one.
[20:45.990 --> 20:48.670]  That's what they all ask for here in the States goes on though.
[20:48.670 --> 20:52.750]  It does say for this reason, I'm seeking to stand out from the crowd and focusing so heavily
[20:52.750 --> 20:53.750]  on quality.
[20:53.750 --> 20:55.430]  That's a good way to focus.
[20:55.430 --> 20:58.990]  Most people are just going to produce as much as they can and try to get it out.
[20:58.990 --> 21:03.190]  If you produce a top shelf product from the beginning and maintain that you will stand
[21:03.190 --> 21:06.430]  out your dispensary, your sales will be top notch.
[21:06.430 --> 21:07.550]  Let me stay focused.
[21:07.550 --> 21:11.550]  Now I can imagine that your cultivars are your babies and you love them all equally
[21:11.550 --> 21:12.970]  but differently.
[21:12.970 --> 21:19.470]  So which of your cultivars would you recommend for a diverse, uh, for a diversity of experiences
[21:19.470 --> 21:25.430]  as well as medical applications in a brand new and uninformed market and why?
[21:25.430 --> 21:26.430]  That's a really good question.
[21:26.430 --> 21:27.430]  I like this.
[21:27.430 --> 21:31.070]  Uh, this gives me the opportunity to do a little basic cannabis education and also pitch
[21:31.070 --> 21:33.670]  a couple of my lines, which will work very well.
[21:33.670 --> 21:37.350]  So if you're opening a dispensary, if you want a good menu of flower, uh, this goes
[21:37.350 --> 21:39.670]  for anybody around the world, any dispensary.
[21:39.670 --> 21:43.950]  I kind of believe that there are a few key flavors or ranges that you should keep on
[21:43.950 --> 21:46.190]  the shelf and those things I wrote them down here.
[21:46.190 --> 21:47.350]  I've got fruit.
[21:47.350 --> 21:48.590]  You should always have fruity stuff.
[21:48.590 --> 21:51.170]  A lot of people love fruity weed, especially the girls.
[21:51.170 --> 21:53.990]  The younger people really like fruity weed.
[21:53.990 --> 21:55.870]  You should also have gassy weed.
[21:55.870 --> 21:57.750]  I like weed that smells like gas.
[21:57.750 --> 22:00.710]  A lot of the older, uh, more experienced seasoned smokers.
[22:00.710 --> 22:04.790]  We have learned that the gassy stuff is where the good buzz is and I really like a good
[22:04.790 --> 22:06.430]  gassy aroma.
[22:06.430 --> 22:09.790]  Other things you should have are floral, something that smells like flowers.
[22:09.790 --> 22:14.090]  Uh, some people really love a floral smelling cannabis.
[22:14.090 --> 22:16.610]  Other things I really like is a hazy cannabis.
[22:16.610 --> 22:17.610]  Those are kind of spicier.
[22:17.610 --> 22:21.750]  Uh, they're going to have your sandalwood, your lavender sort of smells that's going
[22:21.750 --> 22:22.950]  to come from the hazes.
[22:22.950 --> 22:26.070]  Uh, that may also play into the floral side of things.
[22:26.070 --> 22:29.950]  Then another thing I really think you should have is that cushy and chem sort of aroma
[22:30.150 --> 22:34.710]  that, that OG cush, that chem dog chemical sort of stuff that's different than the fuel.
[22:34.710 --> 22:38.030]  So those are things that kind of range is what I think you should start with.
[22:38.030 --> 22:42.710]  Uh, fruity, gassy, floral, cushy, hazy, chemi sort of stuff.
[22:42.710 --> 22:47.470]  Now let me tell you things in my lineup that I can recommend from each of those flavor
[22:47.470 --> 22:48.470]  categories.
[22:48.470 --> 22:49.590]  Let's start with the fruit category.
[22:49.590 --> 22:54.110]  A lot of my stuff is really easily labeled to identify into the fruit category.
[22:54.110 --> 22:57.230]  One of the first I would recommend is strawberry starburst.
[22:57.230 --> 22:58.390]  It tastes like strawberries.
[22:58.430 --> 23:00.070]  It smells like strawberries.
[23:00.070 --> 23:05.470]  It grows gigantic buds and it is also very potent when grown, dried and cured properly.
[23:05.470 --> 23:07.550]  It also makes amazing concentrates.
[23:07.550 --> 23:10.050]  So the strawberry starburst is one I would recommend.
[23:10.050 --> 23:13.390]  Then of course the sun kiss that is platinum tangy to a rise.
[23:13.390 --> 23:16.810]  It tastes like sweet oranges and once again, you're going to get a lot of good medical
[23:16.810 --> 23:21.390]  benefits from that good fat harvest and that one is super easy to grow.
[23:21.390 --> 23:24.350]  Another fruity one that I would recommend to maybe the blueberry butcher.
[23:24.350 --> 23:28.470]  That one's got that blueberry candy turps and a really serious head buzz.
[23:28.470 --> 23:31.610]  The next category we're going to work into is the gassy stuff.
[23:31.610 --> 23:34.630]  The gassiest one in my lineup would be the machine.
[23:34.630 --> 23:37.190]  The machine puts out super gassy turps.
[23:37.190 --> 23:40.490]  You can smell it for miles away and it grows super easily.
[23:40.490 --> 23:43.550]  Another one that would fall into that category is fist bump.
[23:43.550 --> 23:45.750]  Fist bump is sour diesel to a rise.
[23:45.750 --> 23:47.830]  That sour diesel is super fuely.
[23:47.830 --> 23:52.550]  You're going to get those feel aromas and feel turps out of the fist bump.
[23:52.550 --> 23:54.830]  The next one I wrote down is floral.
[23:54.830 --> 23:57.390]  The character zero will have floral turps to it.
[23:57.390 --> 24:00.150]  Scarlet begonias will have the floral turps to it.
[24:00.150 --> 24:05.630]  A lot of people really seem to enjoy that floral rose lavender sort of a turp that really
[24:05.630 --> 24:07.550]  gets a lot of people's attentions.
[24:07.550 --> 24:09.990]  The next thing I talked about was a haze.
[24:09.990 --> 24:14.550]  It's going to be harder to produce a quality haze in a commercial environment.
[24:14.550 --> 24:18.610]  Something like a Neville's haze, a real good haze will take a long time to produce.
[24:18.610 --> 24:21.670]  Something like a silver haze or something like that.
[24:21.790 --> 24:25.670]  If you want that real hazy flavor, something like that does take a little bit longer to
[24:25.670 --> 24:30.510]  flower but something like a super lemon haze will give you that hazy buzz without the length
[24:30.510 --> 24:31.510]  of flower.
[24:31.510 --> 24:34.550]  Those are usually 10 or 11 week flowers which is short for a haze.
[24:34.550 --> 24:36.310]  You guys are saying 10 or 11 weeks.
[24:36.310 --> 24:38.270]  A long haze can go 16 weeks.
[24:38.270 --> 24:39.790]  I've got one that takes quite a while.
[24:39.790 --> 24:41.510]  I've got two that take a long time.
[24:41.510 --> 24:46.150]  If I wanted to recommend a hazy flavor, something that would have that hashy spicy flavor from
[24:46.150 --> 24:51.130]  my lineup, I would say Sunday show is probably the plant that you're looking for for that
[24:51.130 --> 24:52.130]  flavor.
[24:52.130 --> 24:53.130]  Now let's move forward.
[24:53.130 --> 24:55.690]  The next one is cush and chem.
[24:55.690 --> 24:56.970]  That cushy, chemy flavor.
[24:56.970 --> 24:58.690]  I can't even describe cush properly.
[24:58.690 --> 25:01.970]  It's swampy, it's funky, it's earthy.
[25:01.970 --> 25:06.130]  It's got some moth balls and some funk to it, some dirty foot.
[25:06.130 --> 25:10.450]  Then also there's the chem that falls into this same category which is similar but just
[25:10.450 --> 25:13.430]  kind of chemically and kind of just funkier.
[25:13.430 --> 25:17.610]  You have to smell some good OG cush and some good chem dog to actually, I can't even describe
[25:17.610 --> 25:18.610]  it properly.
[25:19.250 --> 25:23.290]  When you walk through the concert and you go, that one, that's probably a cush or a
[25:23.290 --> 25:24.290]  chem.
[25:24.290 --> 25:28.050]  You need those sort of aromas and flavors, that earthiness, that chocolatiness, those
[25:28.050 --> 25:30.610]  sort of fall in the cushy category.
[25:30.610 --> 25:34.850]  Things for that category that I would recommend from my lineup, the first one would be something
[25:34.850 --> 25:36.770]  that is very new that will come out in May.
[25:36.770 --> 25:38.770]  It's called Kingston Cush.
[25:38.770 --> 25:42.330]  Another one that falls into that category again is The Machine.
[25:42.330 --> 25:46.050]  Those will both give you a lot of chemy, a lot of cushy sort of terps.
[25:46.050 --> 25:49.930]  You may find some chocolate, you may find some chemicals in there, lots of great flavors
[25:49.930 --> 25:51.250]  and aromas.
[25:51.250 --> 25:55.090]  I would start with the fruit, the gas, the floral, the cush and the chem.
[25:55.090 --> 25:58.970]  If you can fit it into the grow, I would work some haze into there next.
[25:58.970 --> 26:03.470]  I would definitely have something that gives people a major, major head buzz, something
[26:03.470 --> 26:05.130]  to get their head spinning.
[26:05.130 --> 26:08.890]  Then I would also recommend something more on the indica side to get them sort of chilled
[26:08.890 --> 26:09.890]  out.
[26:09.890 --> 26:12.490]  Then I may also recommend something with some CBD in it.
[26:12.490 --> 26:17.810]  I'm not sure the market for CBD in Germany, but here in the States, a CBD product definitely
[26:17.810 --> 26:18.810]  would sell.
[26:18.810 --> 26:21.610]  Of course, the one I would recommend for you there would be Purple Heart.
[26:21.610 --> 26:26.190]  I'm not sure how to get you Purple Heart seeds in Germany, but we can do our best to allegedly
[26:26.190 --> 26:27.190]  make that happen.
[26:27.190 --> 26:29.090]  There is more to this question, my friend.
[26:29.090 --> 26:33.210]  It says, which of your cultivars would you recommend to a new breeder to start breeding
[26:33.210 --> 26:34.210]  unique phenotypes?
[26:34.210 --> 26:37.810]  Then it says, you will be credited on all of these phenotypes.
[26:37.810 --> 26:41.410]  Wow, that's a really good question.
[26:41.410 --> 26:45.810]  The first thought was that I don't know that I would breed with just my stuff because that
[26:45.810 --> 26:47.810]  kind of locks you in to a trap.
[26:47.810 --> 26:52.010]  I've only made so many things and there are only so many plants to work with from my lineup
[26:52.010 --> 26:56.910]  that I don't want to accidentally steer you down the path of inbreeding and breeding yourself
[26:56.910 --> 26:59.450]  into a box and not having options.
[26:59.450 --> 27:02.930]  My first idea would be to pick a male plant or a female plant.
[27:02.930 --> 27:07.490]  I would say pick a male from my lineup, something that's got the traits you're looking for.
[27:07.490 --> 27:12.810]  Then I would pick a female from other breeders' lineups or several females from several other
[27:12.810 --> 27:13.810]  breeders.
[27:13.810 --> 27:15.690]  That way we can create diversity.
[27:15.690 --> 27:20.850]  I've only got so many male plants in my lineup, so everything is going to have Golden Goat
[27:20.850 --> 27:21.850]  in it.
[27:21.850 --> 27:23.370]  Everything's going to have a Rise in it.
[27:23.370 --> 27:28.010]  Everything is going to have either Blueberry Cookies or BC Lemon Skunk in it because I've
[27:28.010 --> 27:30.530]  only got so many options, which is fun.
[27:30.530 --> 27:34.410]  I could find a couple of things that are not related and we could breed those, but then
[27:34.410 --> 27:37.290]  if you wanted to work with anything else in my lineup, you've kind of worked yourself
[27:37.410 --> 27:39.930]  into a trap because it's already got most of that shit in it.
[27:39.930 --> 27:41.970]  I think you understand what I'm saying by now.
[27:41.970 --> 27:45.170]  I did write down some good ideas though.
[27:45.170 --> 27:48.530]  I would take one from myself and then I would take a male from my stuff.
[27:48.530 --> 27:53.090]  I'd probably pick like a Jack Tripper or a Fist Bump male at this time.
[27:53.090 --> 27:56.170]  I think those would both be really fun to find a good male.
[27:56.170 --> 28:01.250]  So the Fist Bump male and then like something fruity from Miss Jill and then something really
[28:01.250 --> 28:06.970]  frosty from Ethos and then something really candy flavored from Seed Junkie and then just
[28:06.970 --> 28:13.330]  pick something from everybody else out there, something really frosty and turpy from Exotic.
[28:13.330 --> 28:15.730]  Just go find something from every breeder out there that you enjoy.
[28:15.730 --> 28:17.530]  I don't know who you're into.
[28:17.530 --> 28:19.850]  Breed it to the Cindy 99 from Mr. Soul.
[28:19.850 --> 28:25.010]  But use my male and pollinate a bunch of different females to create diversity is what I would
[28:25.010 --> 28:26.010]  do.
[28:26.010 --> 28:31.570]  But if it had to be from my line, I would breed the, I would choose a Fist Bump male
[28:31.570 --> 28:35.370]  and I would pollinate a John Lemon female is what I think I would do right now.
[28:35.370 --> 28:37.770]  I think those would be really awesome.
[28:37.770 --> 28:44.530]  You would get a lemony, sour diesel, kush, haze combo sort of a thing that would be all
[28:44.530 --> 28:48.090]  of the amazing shit that would have all of the good stuff that you need and it would
[28:48.090 --> 28:49.450]  grow vigorously.
[28:49.450 --> 28:52.970]  I would taste super dank and I would have an amazing fucking buzz.
[28:52.970 --> 28:53.970]  And then I would do it the other way.
[28:53.970 --> 28:56.730]  Also, I do Fist Bump to John Lemon just to see what the difference is.
[28:56.730 --> 28:57.730]  All right.
[28:57.730 --> 28:58.730]  Then there is another question.
[28:58.730 --> 29:03.030]  It says, how would you recommend increasing terpene content as a whole?
[29:03.030 --> 29:07.910]  This one I'm going to say that I've recently done multiple podcasts about increasing terps.
[29:07.910 --> 29:11.110]  It's not just one thing that you can do to increase terpenes.
[29:11.110 --> 29:13.030]  Everything has to be correct.
[29:13.030 --> 29:14.030]  The light has to be right.
[29:14.030 --> 29:19.030]  The air, the water, the soil, the nutrients, the dry backs, the harvest time, especially
[29:19.030 --> 29:21.270]  the drying cure process.
[29:21.270 --> 29:23.550]  Everything has to be perfect to get the terpenes dialed in.
[29:23.550 --> 29:25.710]  You can't just add one silver bullet.
[29:25.710 --> 29:26.830]  You can't just do one thing.
[29:26.830 --> 29:31.430]  You've got to get the whole chess board dialed in and checkmate that motherfucker to get yourself
[29:31.430 --> 29:33.010]  the perfect terpenes.
[29:33.010 --> 29:36.610]  And it says, do you know to increase any particular terpenes?
[29:36.610 --> 29:37.690]  Yes.
[29:37.690 --> 29:43.770]  I've noticed that in lemon strains, strains that naturally produce high limonene, if I
[29:43.770 --> 29:47.610]  get them too close to the light and give them a little bit of light stress, especially with
[29:47.610 --> 29:53.850]  an HPS, that will heavily increase the limonene production in plants that naturally produce
[29:53.850 --> 29:54.850]  limonene.
[29:54.850 --> 29:56.890]  So put them a little too close to the light.
[29:56.890 --> 29:57.970]  Watch them freak out a little bit.
[29:57.970 --> 30:02.010]  When you smoke them, they're going to be fucking super tremendously lemony.
[30:02.010 --> 30:07.010]  Also, cold, a little bit of cold at night will bring out temperature.
[30:07.010 --> 30:08.730]  I don't want to tell you to go too extreme.
[30:08.730 --> 30:12.870]  Don't go more than 10 degrees in your diurnal difference, your day and night swing.
[30:12.870 --> 30:16.530]  But if you can get it kind of warm during the day and then a little bit colder at night,
[30:16.530 --> 30:17.810]  that will bring out some flavors.
[30:17.810 --> 30:22.250]  I don't know the science behind that, but in my experience, that has been a good way
[30:22.250 --> 30:23.770]  to bring out some flavors.
[30:23.770 --> 30:28.010]  Also get all your nutrients dialed in, add some kelp, add some carbs.
[30:28.010 --> 30:31.690]  Carbs and sugars are definitely going to help with that flavor.
[30:31.690 --> 30:36.250]  So I've already done a full podcast on getting the flavors and aromas, but get it all dialed
[30:36.250 --> 30:40.570]  in, feed a lot of carbs, a lot of sugars, a little bit of kelp in there, and then dry
[30:40.570 --> 30:41.850]  and cure properly.
[30:41.850 --> 30:44.010]  And also it's proper strain selection.
[30:44.010 --> 30:47.250]  You have to select the proper strains for terpene production.
[30:47.250 --> 30:49.570]  All right, there is one more part to this question.
[30:49.570 --> 30:54.130]  It says, have you noticed any influence from either companion plants producing different
[30:54.130 --> 30:59.170]  soil exudates or if the terpenes and pheromones of other plants in the room influence the
[30:59.170 --> 31:00.730]  terpene profile?
[31:01.450 --> 31:03.650]  I don't grow like this.
[31:03.650 --> 31:06.810]  I just grow in a very sterile grow room environment.
[31:06.810 --> 31:08.410]  I'm not doing living soil.
[31:08.410 --> 31:10.610]  I don't use companion plants.
[31:10.610 --> 31:12.730]  There are ganja plants in my room.
[31:12.730 --> 31:18.690]  So I don't really have any useful information on this part here, but I honestly don't have
[31:18.690 --> 31:24.970]  any useful information on if companion plants or their exudates or their terpenes will affect
[31:24.970 --> 31:25.970]  the other plants in the room.
[31:25.970 --> 31:27.050]  I really don't know that part.
[31:27.050 --> 31:29.210]  I don't have any science behind that.
[31:29.210 --> 31:31.410]  That is above my pay grade, my dude.
[31:31.410 --> 31:34.250]  If anybody out there does have any feedback on that, send me a message.
[31:34.250 --> 31:39.210]  I will read the feedback on the show because that is one part I definitely do not have
[31:39.210 --> 31:40.630]  a good answer for.
[31:40.630 --> 31:41.890]  They do wrap this message up though.
[31:41.890 --> 31:47.890]  It says also influenced by you, I now send mental hugs to my mom in Texas daily.
[31:47.890 --> 31:50.810]  Every time I finish a podcast of yours, I'll feed her Zane.
[31:50.810 --> 31:53.570]  Bro, that is super cool that I make you think about your mom, that you're sending her a
[31:53.570 --> 31:55.010]  hug every episode.
[31:55.010 --> 31:56.210]  It's almost Mother's Day, you guys.
[31:56.210 --> 32:00.170]  By the time this episode comes out, I think we've got like two and a half, two, maybe
[32:00.170 --> 32:01.490]  three weeks before Mother's Day.
[32:01.490 --> 32:06.410]  So heads up, stoners, set an alarm on your phone, write it down on the grow room calendar,
[32:06.410 --> 32:10.610]  get mama card, get mama some flowers, get that shit lined up now, you guys, because
[32:10.610 --> 32:12.610]  we all know without mama, there ain't shit happening.
[32:12.610 --> 32:13.610]  All right.
[32:13.610 --> 32:14.610]  I'm throwing Michael.
[32:14.610 --> 32:15.610]  Thank you for the great message.
[32:15.610 --> 32:16.610]  I do appreciate it.
[32:16.610 --> 32:17.610]  Thank you for the great content.
[32:17.610 --> 32:20.330]  You gave me a lot of stuff to read and talk about here on the podcast.
[32:20.330 --> 32:23.170]  I cannot send you seeds to Germany, unfortunately.
[32:23.170 --> 32:27.370]  However, if you do have an American address, I would be more than happy to send those seeds
[32:27.370 --> 32:29.830]  to you at an American address.
[32:29.830 --> 32:33.890]  If you think you can legally receive those seeds in Germany, please do reach out, explain
[32:33.890 --> 32:36.570]  your method, explain that neither one of us are going to get in trouble.
[32:36.570 --> 32:41.010]  Maybe we can help you out, but I'm not comfortable sending to Germany to be quite honest with
[32:41.010 --> 32:42.010]  you.
[32:42.010 --> 32:43.010]  But I do owe you some sort of a prize.
[32:43.010 --> 32:46.770]  If we can't get you seeds to Germany, maybe I'll send you some t-shirts or something because
[32:46.770 --> 32:48.930]  I do appreciate the great content.
[32:48.930 --> 32:51.290]  Once again, thank you, my friend, for the great message.
[32:51.290 --> 32:52.290]  Everybody out there.
[32:52.290 --> 32:56.090]  If you cannot get your message right on today's podcast, have no fear because I've got a lot
[32:56.090 --> 32:59.170]  of messages in front of me and I plan on doing a lot more episodes.
[32:59.170 --> 33:02.690]  If you want your opportunity to win a free pack of seeds, all you have to do is go to
[33:02.690 --> 33:05.970]  the Grow Help tab on iRegenetics.com.
[33:05.970 --> 33:08.970]  Find that Grow Help tab, click on there, send me a good question.
[33:08.970 --> 33:13.930]  If I read your question here on the podcast, I will send you a free pack of iRegenetics
[33:13.930 --> 33:14.930]  seeds.
[33:14.930 --> 33:19.890]  And once again, that free seed giveaway is sponsored by my friends at seedsherenow.com.
[33:19.890 --> 33:23.890]  Big shout out to everybody at seedsherenow.com for keeping everyone stocked with seeds.
[33:23.890 --> 33:24.890]  All right, everybody.
[33:24.890 --> 33:27.250]  I think that's all I've got for you for this episode.

[33:38.050 --> 33:40.650]  Or if you got some hate mail, send it my way, bro.
[33:40.650 --> 33:42.410]  I'm not scared.

[33:43.410 --> 33:44.410]  Patreon.

[33:48.890 --> 33:52.690]  Today I put a bunch of new stuff on iredirect.com and guess what?
[33:52.690 --> 33:55.250]  Everybody on Patreon got the very first heads up.
[33:55.250 --> 33:59.890]  There was some stuff that was very limited and I think it sold out through patron members,
[33:59.890 --> 34:01.050]  through Patreon supporters.
[34:01.050 --> 34:05.330]  It sold out before the civilians even got access to the drop.
[34:05.330 --> 34:08.250]  So patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[34:08.250 --> 34:09.250]  Sign up there.

[34:31.090 --> 34:34.970]  There's a link to get iRegenetics t-shirts, which are on blowout sale prices.
[34:34.970 --> 34:37.170]  That is all at iRegenetics.com.
[34:37.170 --> 34:38.290]  All right.
[34:38.290 --> 34:40.250]  That is all I've got for you for this episode.
[34:40.250 --> 34:42.290]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[34:42.290 --> 34:45.170]  I want to give a giant shout out to my buddy Petro.
[34:45.170 --> 34:48.610]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
