[01:02.760 --> 01:07.520]  by talking about what I'm smoking. Today I've been taking dabs of Sour Best
[01:07.520 --> 01:13.000]  Lemons Live Batter. This is a blend of S-B-S-E that stands for sour best shit
[01:13.000 --> 01:17.800]  ever and also lemon tree northern lights. On the package the flavor is described
[01:17.800 --> 01:22.360]  as lemons, lemons and more lemons. I completely agree with that lemons and
[01:22.360 --> 01:27.200]  lemons and lemons description. This shit is delicious. It's super lemony, super
[01:27.200 --> 01:31.600]  turpy. It punches me right in the face and it makes me super rambly so it
[01:31.600 --> 01:35.480]  should be great podcast concentrates. On the back of the package it says it does
[01:35.480 --> 01:41.760]  contain 70.10% THC and non-detectable amounts of CBD. Big
[01:41.760 --> 01:47.840]  shout out to the Sour Best Lemons Live Batter. Alright in this episode I'm going
[01:47.840 --> 01:51.660]  to read a couple of emails and patreon messages. Before we get there let's do a
[01:51.660 --> 01:56.160]  few shout outs to some of the folks in the 710 club. Of course the 710 club are
[01:56.160 --> 02:00.320]  the folks who support us on the $7.10 a month level or higher on
[02:00.320 --> 02:04.440]  patreon. So with no further ado let's start off with the big grow from your
[02:04.440 --> 02:07.860]  heart podcast. Thank you shout out to John Butler. Let's send a special thank
[02:07.860 --> 02:11.720]  you shout out to Austin Ron. Let's send a thank you shout out to Brian C. I want

[03:27.740 --> 03:31.940]  the first email of today's episode. If you'd like to send me an email, my email address
[03:31.940 --> 03:37.780]  is growfromyourheartathotmail.com. If you've got cannabis culture, cannabis, cannabis cultivation
[03:37.780 --> 03:41.100]  questions, I would love to hear from you. Of course, the quickest way to get your email
[03:41.100 --> 03:46.060]  to the top of the pile is through that Patreon contribution. But today's first message comes
[03:46.060 --> 03:52.500]  from Mobius 84 and it goes a lot like this. It says, Hey, Rasta Jeff, this is a bit of
[03:52.500 --> 03:56.700]  a change in what we usually discuss and I imagine it's because it's hard to describe
[03:56.700 --> 04:02.980]  vocally and also everyone has their own preferences. Yes, this is very preference oriented. When
[04:02.980 --> 04:07.460]  we get to the message, it says, I thought it would be great to go over pruning your
[04:07.460 --> 04:12.860]  plants in veg. That is quite often overlooked. This is a great opportunity to talk about
[04:12.860 --> 04:17.780]  that. It says this is a vital and necessary tool in every good grower's belt, but very
[04:17.780 --> 04:22.800]  little info on this part of growing is out there. I've been growing for over 15 years
[04:22.800 --> 04:28.000]  and I still have a ton of questions on when to start pruning and how much you can prune,
[04:28.000 --> 04:32.880]  what works best to flower an area. My buddy hates to pick any leaves and I like to take
[04:32.880 --> 04:38.960]  things most off slowly over time, but picking leaves is only part of pruning, knowing what
[04:38.960 --> 04:45.520]  branches to keep or to better open up your plant. All of these things are rarely discussed
[04:45.520 --> 04:50.460]  in detail. Maybe grab a plant from a tent at two or three different stages of veg and
[04:50.460 --> 04:57.500]  show us exactly what you can do. Just as always, much love and respect and thanks for
[04:57.500 --> 05:03.900]  making my growing better every day. Big shout out from Mobius Grows. Yeah, I love hearing
[05:03.900 --> 05:07.660]  that I make your growing better every day. Just a few things to make your garden more
[05:07.660 --> 05:12.340]  simple, more enjoyable will go a long way. Thank you for that. Those kind of compliments
[05:12.340 --> 05:17.080]  recharge me and make podcasting better for me. It makes podcasting, I'm more enthusiastic
[05:17.080 --> 05:21.420]  about it. I always say it's like recharge for me. This is human recharge right here.
[05:21.420 --> 05:25.680]  So let's get a little bit focused and talk about the question at hand pruning plants
[05:25.680 --> 05:31.240]  in veg. Yeah, that is quite often overlooked and it can be very beneficial if done correctly
[05:31.240 --> 05:37.900]  and timed perfectly. So let's talk about it. I start pruning kind of early. I run a lot
[05:37.900 --> 05:43.280]  of commercial style grows and I need fast heavy production. Also, I find that too many
[05:43.280 --> 05:48.600]  leaves are problematic. The leaves are where the powdery mildew develops. The leaves are
[05:48.600 --> 05:52.720]  where the bugs hide. The leaves are where the shit happens. If you don't have excess
[05:52.720 --> 05:57.680]  leaves in the grow, it is easier to avoid what is known as a microclimate. You may have
[05:57.680 --> 06:02.080]  a perfect environment in your grow where your meters are hanging, where the thermometer
[06:02.080 --> 06:05.920]  is hanging, where the humidity meter, the hygrometer, that's what it's called. My brain
[06:05.920 --> 06:11.040]  would not say that word. Where the humidity, the hygrometer and thermometers are hanging.
[06:11.040 --> 06:14.880]  You may have a perfect environment right there, but what about down in the canopy where
[06:14.880 --> 06:18.720]  all those fucking leaves are, where all that moisture is coming out of the plants at different
[06:18.720 --> 06:23.360]  levels at different times? You may have fucking microclimates within that environment. So
[06:23.360 --> 06:27.320]  if you take off all those leaves that will help minimize microclimate. So I do a lot
[06:27.320 --> 06:33.680]  of heavy pruning in veg and in flower. I start early. Those little tiny, when the plant barely
[06:33.680 --> 06:37.520]  starts growing, those two little tiny shit leaves, that is where I begin pruning. Those
[06:37.520 --> 06:41.160]  come off immediately. As soon as I've got a good developed plant, that bottom stuff
[06:41.160 --> 06:47.400]  starts coming off. So let's talk about pruning in veg strategically. Like I just said, I
[06:47.400 --> 06:51.320]  start with those first little shitty leaves that start, those come off. The plant will
[06:51.320 --> 06:57.680]  start getting bigger. Pruning is kind of depends on the shape and size and goal of your plant
[06:57.680 --> 07:02.460]  as well. I want to take off a little bit of stuff to increase growth and also minimize
[07:02.460 --> 07:07.360]  problems in early veg. So as the plant is growing, you're going to get good growth at
[07:07.360 --> 07:11.600]  the top. At the bottom, you're going to get some little weak, shitty shoots. They are
[07:11.600 --> 07:16.520]  not branches. I call them shoots. I pinch those right off. Then when I plant the plant
[07:16.520 --> 07:21.280]  into my three gallon pot, I kind of let it grow a little bit. As the bigger branches
[07:21.280 --> 07:26.440]  start to grow, that is when I start to do pruning and defoliation. I leave the bottom
[07:26.440 --> 07:29.880]  branches and give them an opportunity to grow up. If they don't look like they're going
[07:29.880 --> 07:33.600]  to meet the top of the plant, the stuff on the bottom gets taken off. If the branches
[07:33.600 --> 07:37.160]  look like they will meet the rest of the plant and be viable branches that will reach my
[07:37.200 --> 07:43.040]  scrog and turn into useful buds in the future, I will leave them on. But I take all the crap
[07:43.040 --> 07:47.040]  at the bottom of the branch off. So I will have a long branch with nothing on it except
[07:47.040 --> 07:51.160]  a couple of leaves at the tip. And those leaves at the tip will turn into buds once they're
[07:51.160 --> 07:56.080]  in the scrog and they go into flower. So I take off all the little tiny sucker shoots.
[07:56.080 --> 07:59.960]  I leave the branches and take off the shoots and kind of clean up the messy part on the
[07:59.960 --> 08:06.560]  bottom of the plant. Now as it grows, we will do more defoliation and manipulation. Eventually
[08:06.560 --> 08:10.160]  the plant will get topped. We're going to do a full lesson on topping. We're going to
[08:10.160 --> 08:13.480]  do more lessons on this in the future. I've got some things planned for you, but we're
[08:13.480 --> 08:17.560]  going to focus on this while we are here. I will top the plant. Once I see what the
[08:17.560 --> 08:21.640]  plant does when it's topped, I know how much I need to take off of the bottom. Why am I
[08:21.640 --> 08:25.680]  taking things off of the bottom? I've mentioned this a moment ago. I want to send that energy
[08:25.680 --> 08:30.000]  from the bottom up to the top of the plant and get maximum growth from the top of the
[08:30.000 --> 08:34.800]  plant from those big beefy branches up top. Also, I want to remove some leaves so that
[08:34.800 --> 08:39.040]  I can get better light down into the plant. Those lower parts of the plant want light
[08:39.040 --> 08:43.760]  also. You will get better growth from there. Also, like I mentioned a moment ago, we are
[08:43.760 --> 08:49.120]  mitigating problems, eliminating opportunities for problems by removing some of these excess
[08:49.120 --> 08:52.720]  leaves. There aren't as many places for bugs to hide. Spider mites can't hang out if you
[08:52.720 --> 08:56.720]  don't have as many leaves. Powdery mildew doesn't have as many places to happen if you
[08:56.720 --> 09:01.560]  don't have any leaves. Other things won't go wrong. You won't have humidity issues if
[09:01.560 --> 09:05.360]  you don't have as many leaves. It's going to help us out. Now, how do we start doing
[09:05.360 --> 09:08.960]  this? We have topped our plant. We've got a nice little shape going on up top. I go
[09:08.960 --> 09:14.040]  to the very bottom. If it just is a little short sucker growth and not a real branch,
[09:14.040 --> 09:18.000]  I don't even use scissors. I use my thumbnail. I've always got a little excessive thumbnail
[09:18.000 --> 09:22.200]  and just pick that shit right off. If it doesn't look like it's going to be worth trimming
[09:22.200 --> 09:27.380]  in the future, pick it right off. If you've got big, long leaves that are shadowing and
[09:27.380 --> 09:33.420]  shading that plant, pull those leaves off. My rule of thumb is when the plant is in its
[09:33.420 --> 09:38.940]  big veg pot, when it is established and growing and developed and it's booming, I take off
[09:38.940 --> 09:45.260]  almost every leaf with a purple petiole. That is just strategic. That is an easy way for
[09:45.260 --> 09:49.620]  me to train people that work in a cultivation facility. If you see that purple petiole,
[09:49.620 --> 09:54.060]  that leaf can go. Those leaves, in my opinion, if the petiole is turned purple, that leaf
[09:54.060 --> 09:59.100]  is big enough to be blocking something underneath it and it can probably be removed. I'll start
[09:59.100 --> 10:03.620]  doing that before I move the plants into flower. I'm trying to think of a way to describe how
[10:03.620 --> 10:08.200]  I'm opening up the plant and pulling out all that shit in the middle. I've topped the plant.
[10:08.200 --> 10:12.580]  It's got four big tops by now, at least two nice tops, at least four. It's got a couple
[10:12.580 --> 10:16.980]  of under branches coming up, some lower branches. I can see where the light is hitting. I put
[10:16.980 --> 10:21.940]  the plant under the light and I look to see how far down into the canopy that light goes.
[10:21.940 --> 10:26.940]  If I can move a few leaves out of the way to get that light down further into the canopy,
[10:26.940 --> 10:30.700]  that's exactly what I do. I'm trying to get that light into my plant a little bit more
[10:30.700 --> 10:35.380]  to get that plant saturated in light all the way to those bottom bud sites. I clean it
[10:35.380 --> 10:40.300]  up, take the leaves off the top and I see how far down the light can go. Once the light
[10:40.300 --> 10:44.180]  will no longer penetrate into that plant, because there's a certain depth of how far
[10:44.180 --> 10:48.460]  the light will go, it goes a certain depth on its own, then it is blocked by shadows
[10:48.460 --> 10:52.420]  of the plant. You can see where it stops being sufficient light. Once that plant isn't
[10:52.420 --> 10:56.220]  getting sufficient light down at a certain level, all of the sucker branches, all of
[10:56.220 --> 11:00.580]  the developing potential bud sites there get removed. I can see that nothing's going to
[11:00.580 --> 11:05.940]  happen down there. That area where there's no light is going to get yellow shitty leaves,
[11:05.940 --> 11:10.220]  small spindly, we call it larfy growth. That little fluffy shit that you don't want to
[11:10.220 --> 11:13.940]  trim that always ends up in the hash pile that is like, I don't want to trim that and
[11:13.940 --> 11:17.460]  it's not worth smoking. We may just turn it into concentrates. That is called larf. We
[11:17.460 --> 11:22.380]  can get rid of that. Trim that shit off now. If you cut that shit off the bottoms of the
[11:22.380 --> 11:26.300]  plants in early veg, it will send it up to the tops and you will have bigger, fatter,
[11:26.300 --> 11:30.100]  beefier buds. You're not wasting time on that shit at the bottom. Basically, you're not
[11:30.100 --> 11:33.860]  dragging crap you don't need. You've only got good things in your bag, so you're going
[11:33.860 --> 11:39.980]  to grow big fat buds. That's the veg part. I talked briefly about that because I do intend
[11:39.980 --> 11:44.220]  in the future, like you requested, to drag a plant out of a grow room and put it on a
[11:44.220 --> 11:48.700]  table and give you a couple of grow lessons. However, the podcast is not there yet. There
[11:48.700 --> 11:52.940]  is more equipment coming. There are a lot of things coming for this podcast in the future.
[11:52.940 --> 11:59.180]  I want to tease you but not give too much shit away, but stay tuned because I am improving.
[11:59.180 --> 12:04.780]  Amazon deliveries are taking longer than they should because of the COVID situation. Some
[12:04.780 --> 12:08.620]  items are sold out. It feels like everybody on the fucking planet decided to start a podcast
[12:08.620 --> 12:12.900]  this couple of months. Some equipment is harder to get. Things are happening, but I promise
[12:12.900 --> 12:17.020]  you, I assure you, there are improvements for this podcast coming. This smile is not
[12:17.020 --> 12:21.740]  fake. I'm fucking excited for what's coming for the show. There will be more better visuals
[12:21.740 --> 12:26.620]  on the show. There will be plants pulled out of grows, and you will see things in the future.
[12:26.620 --> 12:29.900]  I assure you and promise you that that is coming. Please stick around for that. For
[12:29.900 --> 12:34.580]  now, this is what we've got. We're going to make this work. I apologize if I have abandoned
[12:34.580 --> 12:38.020]  any of my audio listeners. What just happened? My audio just went weird. I want to make sure
[12:38.020 --> 12:41.660]  it's still good and recording. Anyway, sorry, guys. Had to edit a little bit. I was saying
[12:41.700 --> 12:46.660]  that I apologize if I have abandoned any of my audio listeners by switching to a video
[12:46.660 --> 12:50.620]  format. I felt there was more to offer with a video format. I will be able to show plants.
[12:50.620 --> 12:55.820]  I'll be able to show more visual descriptions. If you are listening on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher
[12:55.820 --> 13:00.900]  Radio, Spotify, any of the podcast services that do not provide video, I encourage you,
[13:00.900 --> 13:05.140]  I invite you to come check out the YouTube channel. It is easy to find. Go to YouTube,
[13:05.140 --> 13:09.020]  search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast. Click subscribe. Check out the videos because
[13:09.020 --> 13:12.780]  I do promise there is more cool shit coming up in the future. Like I said, I'll be pulling
[13:12.780 --> 13:17.220]  plants out of grow spaces, giving grow lessons with those plants. All right, let me get myself
[13:17.220 --> 13:20.780]  back on track. We're talking about pruning. I've talked a little bit about pruning and
[13:20.780 --> 13:26.820]  veg. Then we're going to move into the flowering phase. I think that in flower on day one,
[13:26.820 --> 13:31.620]  I really stripped those plants kind of hard, almost to where it's scary. It's almost like,
[13:31.620 --> 13:35.580]  oh shit, I go medium hard. Then I give them about two and a half, three weeks and I do
[13:35.620 --> 13:39.580]  it again. I give them about two and a half, three weeks and I do it again. Then it's almost
[13:39.580 --> 13:43.940]  harvest time. At harvest time, I stripped the shit out of them. I believe that proper
[13:43.940 --> 13:49.820]  pruning and defoliation can really increase the vigor of your plants, the speed of growth,
[13:49.820 --> 13:53.420]  the structure of your plants. If it is done strategically, it doesn't stress the plants
[13:53.420 --> 13:59.260]  out too much. In a commercial environment, it's hard to send a guy in there to go defoliate
[13:59.260 --> 14:03.660]  that room a little bit today. You send the whole crew in and you go, hit that room. I
[14:03.700 --> 14:07.580]  want it defoliated at a level four today. By the end of the day, that's your goal. The
[14:07.580 --> 14:11.940]  guys go in there and they do the whole room. Then we've got the whole room a certain way.
[14:11.940 --> 14:16.180]  Then a few weeks later, we'll do it again. It is easier to send them in there that way
[14:16.180 --> 14:19.500]  instead of just pulling a few leaves here and there and here and there. Go hit it on
[14:19.500 --> 14:24.660]  day one, hit it again about day 20, hit it again about day 40. Then it's harvest time.
[14:24.660 --> 14:27.820]  We'll defoliate real hard before harvest so we don't have all that fucking leaf in the
[14:27.820 --> 14:34.980]  harvest area. I think I covered a basic veg pruning and defoliation area. Your idea is
[14:34.980 --> 14:39.500]  to take off anything that will not be useful in the future. It depends on if you're going
[14:39.500 --> 14:43.000]  to run sticks, if you're going to run just plants that aren't topped, if you're topping
[14:43.000 --> 14:47.100]  the plants, if you're running a scrog. If you're doing a scrog, I usually recommend
[14:47.100 --> 14:52.020]  multiple layers of scrog net and everything below that first layer of net gets picked
[14:52.020 --> 14:56.100]  off. If it's not a branch, you can tell the difference between branches and shoots. If
[14:56.100 --> 15:00.580]  it's not, at least the size of a pen or a pencil, it doesn't belong on the plant, cut
[15:00.580 --> 15:04.900]  that little wispy shit off. Then that is when you start working on popping and twisting
[15:04.900 --> 15:09.060]  to make those remaining branches a little more robust. But like I said, we're going
[15:09.060 --> 15:13.020]  to save that for when we can grab a plant and pull it out of the grow and talk about
[15:13.020 --> 15:18.360]  it. All right, Mobius, remind me to do this lesson all over again when we've got the video
[15:18.360 --> 15:22.260]  set up and proved we got some table space, we got some plants to play with, and we will
[15:22.260 --> 15:27.540]  get a video on a little bit of pruning during veg. I wanted to make sure to get this message
[15:27.540 --> 15:32.220]  on. Also wanted to make sure to tease you a little bit about the upcoming improvements
[15:32.220 --> 15:35.880]  for the podcast. All right, where are we going to go from here? This next message comes from
[15:35.880 --> 15:42.580]  our friend Killing Kind, and it says, well, this is a kind of a recap of a previous episode.
[15:42.580 --> 15:49.100]  It says, I got four yellow pH pens with four different readings. Yeah, we were talking
[15:49.100 --> 15:52.700]  about that you guys sometimes the equipment is not as reliable as we think we've got
[15:52.700 --> 15:56.820]  to back it up. We've got to check on it. You've got to use it against another pen. It goes
[15:56.820 --> 16:02.380]  on to say, so I actually snagged a blue lab snagged a blue lab pen from work and all as
[16:02.380 --> 16:07.180]  well. There we go. We got some quality equipment, we quit using those yellow pH pens. And the
[16:07.180 --> 16:11.220]  blue lab is reliable. If that little checkmark is not in place on the screen, it needs to
[16:11.220 --> 16:16.520]  be calibrated. calibrate that bad bitch at least once a week. Make sure to keep it clean.
[16:16.520 --> 16:21.080]  it in the proper solution and it should last you a really long time. It says lemon Jeffrey
[16:21.080 --> 16:27.240]  makes beautiful short bushy clones. I'm on my third run and I love everything about this
[16:27.240 --> 16:32.400]  strain. That is a great message. Thank you for the great update on the pH pens. If you
[16:32.400 --> 16:35.540]  guys have been listening to the show, you remember what that is about. I just wanted
[16:35.540 --> 16:39.040]  to make sure to get killing kinds message on there. There is more stuff he sent to me
[16:39.040 --> 16:43.680]  in this one. And I will be in touch with you about the personal message included in this
[16:43.800 --> 16:48.240]  email. You guys make sure you check out your pH meters, your pH pens, make sure they are
[16:48.240 --> 16:52.600]  calibrated and cleaned and compare them to another meter because if you only have one,
[16:52.600 --> 16:55.680]  how do you know if it's even right? Maybe you need to get some drops. Try the drops
[16:55.680 --> 17:01.320]  one time. Compare the drops in the paper. Compare that reading to what your meter says.
[17:01.320 --> 17:04.360]  Make sure it is right because those drops, they're always calibrated. They don't fuck
[17:04.360 --> 17:10.440]  up. Let me keep moving because like I said a moment ago, I am super rambly today. All
[17:10.680 --> 17:14.480]  right, podcast world. This next email comes from somebody who does not want their name
[17:14.480 --> 17:19.460]  said but it goes just like this. It says, hey, Ross to Jeff. I hope all is well with
[17:19.460 --> 17:23.480]  you and the fam and the friends. Things are great, bro. Thank you for checking in. I hope
[17:23.480 --> 17:29.320]  you were doing well also. It says, call me Fur Free Bro. Stoners from the 70s may get
[17:29.320 --> 17:33.680]  the reference. I think you were referring to the furry freak brothers if I've been paying
[17:33.680 --> 17:38.600]  attention to my older stoner friends. I think that may be who you're talking about. But
[17:38.600 --> 17:42.680]  anyway, what's up Fur Free Bro? Good to see you. It says, I first tried my hand at cultivation
[17:42.680 --> 17:48.440]  back in the late 80s when indoor grow stores started popping up in my area. Michigan stoners
[17:48.440 --> 17:53.440]  have always been able to find ways to build up the community. Yes, Michigan has a great
[17:53.440 --> 17:57.920]  group of cannabis enthusiasts, cultivators, a community. Big shout out to those guys out
[17:57.920 --> 18:02.400]  there killing it. Guys and gals out there killing it, doing some shit. It says, needless
[18:02.400 --> 18:08.520]  to say though, the latest gear was available. The information and education was not. Yeah,
[18:08.520 --> 18:14.120]  we are still learning and evolving. Things were not what they are. That is for sure.
[18:14.120 --> 18:19.920]  It says, unfortunately for me, my employer instituted random drug testing at around the
[18:19.920 --> 18:25.360]  same time and I had to drop out of the community. So 25 years later, wow, our friend had to
[18:25.360 --> 18:28.960]  drop out of the cannabis community to keep a job because the drug testing wasn't going
[18:28.960 --> 18:34.240]  to allow him to stay employed. So he dropped out. But now here we are 25 years later, seeing
[18:34.240 --> 18:39.160]  retirement right around the corner, I knew it was time to get back to it. That is right.
[18:39.160 --> 18:43.200]  We see this a lot in Colorado. People think that all of the cannabis consumers are young
[18:43.200 --> 18:47.760]  stoners, a bunch of potheads. It is a lot of retired folks, a lot of people in your
[18:47.760 --> 18:52.120]  situation who have just want, they've been unable to smoke for years because of a job
[18:52.120 --> 18:55.800]  or responsibilities and now it is time to just chill the fuck out. And we see a lot
[18:55.800 --> 19:01.880]  of them coming to get some cannabis. Let me keep up with myself. It says, luckily, talking
[19:02.400 --> 19:09.080]  to a coworker helped, sorry, let me fix myself. Luckily, talking to a coworker about it, he
[19:09.080 --> 19:15.240]  tipped me off to your podcast. Absolutely the best grow advice I have ever received.
[19:15.240 --> 19:19.320]  Big shout out to your coworker. Thank you, bro. He knows who he is. Thank you for introducing
[19:19.320 --> 19:24.280]  the show to our friend. It says, I learned something new from almost every episode. I
[19:24.280 --> 19:27.980]  read and listen to a lot of sources and if something catches my attention and it wasn't
[19:27.980 --> 19:32.660]  said by you, I'll search your library to see if you've touched on the subject. 10 times
[19:32.660 --> 19:38.600]  out of 10, you have and your recommendations have been spot on and you have helped me be
[19:38.600 --> 19:44.780]  a better grower. That is awesome, man. Thank you. I do appreciate that. I love knowing
[19:44.780 --> 19:48.380]  that I'm covering the questions that you have. Questions come up and you go, I wonder if
[19:48.380 --> 19:52.860]  he's talked about that and you search and I have. That really makes me feel good. Sometimes
[19:52.860 --> 19:56.940]  as a podcaster, I'm just pitching balls out here and I don't know if anybody is even swinging
[19:56.940 --> 20:00.820]  at them, but it feels like you may be hitting home runs and that makes me feel good because
[20:00.820 --> 20:04.220]  without feedback like this, I don't know if we're getting any success, if I'm doing any
[20:04.220 --> 20:08.420]  good. Trust me guys, I do get plenty of feedback, but this still, it's good to know that I'm
[20:08.420 --> 20:12.540]  putting out episodes that are serving a purpose. I'm not just talking and you guys are going,
[20:12.540 --> 20:16.900]  okay, here he is. I love it. Thank you. Let me keep up with myself again. It says, I started
[20:16.900 --> 20:21.340]  small and cheap. I listened and learned and as I saw my results get better, I started
[20:21.340 --> 20:25.420]  investing in better gear. That is the way to do it. That's exactly the way to do it.
[20:25.420 --> 20:29.580]  Too many people say, I'm going to grow cannabis and they grow fucking, they buy 20 lights
[20:29.580 --> 20:33.140]  and a giant tent and too much shit and then the house can't even run the electrical that
[20:33.140 --> 20:38.260]  they bought. So you did it the right way. Thank you. It says, I started with deep water
[20:38.260 --> 20:43.380]  culture under a cheap Amazon LED under the stairs and eight grows later. I'm growing
[20:43.380 --> 20:50.220]  in cocoa with a bedroom and a bloom room under HLG 550 R specs. Damn, you were killing it,
[20:50.220 --> 20:53.980]  dude. That under the stairs grow is how so many people start to that space right under
[20:53.980 --> 20:58.420]  the stairs, that diagonal angled space. So many people have a grow there. I had to grow
[20:58.420 --> 21:03.020]  there for several years. Uh, that is classic. So, uh, welcome to the club, bro. You are
[21:03.020 --> 21:07.180]  doing it just like we were. It says, I've only been able to enjoy the fruits of my labor
[21:07.180 --> 21:11.420]  within the last year, but thanks to you and your info about storage, I've been able to
[21:11.420 --> 21:17.300]  sample my earlier results versus today's. I can say I came into this on the short bus,
[21:17.300 --> 21:22.060]  but now I'm riding the big bus, bro. Welcome to the big boy club. Uh, you were never on
[21:22.060 --> 21:26.540]  that short bus. Everybody's got to start off somewhere. The best part about starting
[21:26.540 --> 21:32.820]  off as kind of a sub par grower is that you get to fucking improve and improving, encourage
[21:32.820 --> 21:36.980]  you, encourages you. Uh, when you see growth, you feel growth. You want to keep going. Like
[21:36.980 --> 21:40.460]  you guys see the podcast getting better. That's encouraging me to do better, which is making
[21:40.460 --> 21:44.940]  the show better, which you guys send more messages, which makes me want to do better.
[21:44.940 --> 21:49.540]  Uh, there is a lot of investment in time and energy coming to this podcast very soon. And
[21:49.540 --> 21:53.740]  you will see the fruits of your labor, uh, your encouragement, your Patreon contributions,
[21:53.740 --> 21:58.300]  uh, the encouragement to me, my new motivation that will all show real soon here on this
[21:58.300 --> 22:02.100]  show if it's not already, but there's a big improvement coming soon that I'm fucking excited
[22:02.100 --> 22:05.980]  about. You guys will know when it happens. I won't even need to announce it. Uh, but
[22:05.980 --> 22:09.700]  bro, welcome to the big bus. Welcome to the big boy club. Uh, you're hanging out with
[22:09.700 --> 22:13.460]  this now. I'm proud of you. Uh, you've always been invited. You were always welcome. I'm
[22:13.460 --> 22:17.860]  glad you made it to the team. It says grow on the dank. Uh, let's see. All right. So
[22:17.860 --> 22:24.140]  it says I'm finally on the big bus now growing the dank with much. Thanks to you, bro. Thank
[22:24.140 --> 22:28.700]  you. Uh, just, just you putting in the work and the effort for the plant and for the community
[22:28.700 --> 22:33.540]  makes it worth it. So you are paying me back by doing that. Then it goes on to say, I listened
[22:33.540 --> 22:37.260]  to you in the DGC show when I'm gardening. So I'm not sure if it was your recent podcast
[22:37.260 --> 22:42.300]  or theirs, but the topic of pH meters came up and a lot of good messaging came out, but
[22:42.300 --> 22:47.580]  there is one suggestion and I've never heard made that may be helpful or maybe too anal
[22:47.580 --> 22:53.220]  about this. You tell me. All right. So this may be a little bit too uptight for some people,
[22:53.220 --> 22:57.980]  but this is going to be great advice for some people. If this is not for you, don't do it.
[22:57.980 --> 23:01.780]  If this is for you, you're going to find it very valuable. It says when you're building
[23:01.780 --> 23:06.500]  your calibration curve in your meter and you should be using four, seven and 10 standards
[23:06.500 --> 23:11.620]  and then using the seven standard as a check, or if you're just dipping your meter in seven
[23:11.620 --> 23:17.300]  standard and adjusting the meter to read seven, then your meter is not accurate for certain.
[23:17.300 --> 23:21.140]  That makes sense. If you're just checking to one number, it may not be calibrated. I
[23:21.140 --> 23:25.180]  agree with that. It says your calibration standard should never be your check standard
[23:25.180 --> 23:31.820]  also. That makes sense. That is like having me count the money and then me verifying the
[23:31.820 --> 23:35.300]  money. I could have just took 20 out and said that there's a hundred and there's only 80,
[23:35.300 --> 23:39.020]  but since I counted and verified, it's counted and verified. Nobody double checked. You should
[23:39.020 --> 23:43.160]  have a double check. So if you're calibrating with a seven solution, you should have another
[23:43.160 --> 23:48.640]  seven solution to dip it in to make sure that it is correct. Sorry, first day with
[23:48.640 --> 23:53.600]  the new tongue. We'll learn how to use it. It does go on to say if your calibration curve
[23:53.600 --> 23:58.800]  is created with a standard that is compromised, let's say a seven standard that for whatever
[23:58.800 --> 24:04.240]  reason has a true pH of six, when you check your meter with the same seven standard, the
[24:04.240 --> 24:09.180]  meter will still say seven. That is very true. That's kind of what I just said, I think.
[24:09.180 --> 24:13.540]  But if you check that same meter with a seven standard from another source, the meter may
[24:13.540 --> 24:18.700]  say anything but seven. So without that check from a second source, let's say you'd be adjusting
[24:18.700 --> 24:24.380]  your nudes to say six, you may be actually adjusting to five or seven. Usually curve
[24:24.380 --> 24:30.700]  errors aren't linear. Yes. And pH is like exponential as well. So if you fuck up one,
[24:30.700 --> 24:37.540]  you only fuck up 5.1. But if you fuck up two, you actually fuck up 5.200. It doesn't go
[24:37.580 --> 24:45.580]  10, 11. It goes like 10, 1,000, 10, 100. I can't explain the curve right now because I didn't pay
[24:45.580 --> 24:51.220]  attention to that. I didn't study for that. But it is basically exponential on the pH chart. 1.1
[24:51.220 --> 24:59.180]  doesn't mean 0.11. 0.1 means 1.10, but then 1.2 means 1.200. It really adds up really quickly.
[24:59.180 --> 25:02.820]  I would need to research that to give you a better explanation, but I wasn't prepared for
[25:02.900 --> 25:09.380]  that. But I think you got my point. Then it goes on to say, I've been working with pH meters for
[25:09.380 --> 25:15.460]  20 plus years and though it doesn't happen a lot, bad standards do happen. Yes, anything can be
[25:15.460 --> 25:20.980]  failed. They can fuck up anything in production, shipping, can be stored for too long. I think
[25:20.980 --> 25:24.940]  you're only supposed to use that stuff for up to 30 days after you open the bottles anyway. So that
[25:24.940 --> 25:30.660]  could cause problems. It also says, if you want to extend the life of, where is it, the life of
[25:30.700 --> 25:36.100]  your meter, store the probe in the proper storage solution. Absolutely. It's another expense, but
[25:36.100 --> 25:42.260]  cheaper than replacing meters. So many people don't think about that. One small cost today can
[25:42.260 --> 25:49.740]  save you $100 down the line. That storage solution is about $12. The meter was 120. So buy the $12
[25:49.740 --> 25:54.060]  solution. That's 10% of the cost of a new meter, and it will make your meter last probably three
[25:54.060 --> 25:58.740]  or four times as long. So you're saving a lot of money by spending 12 bucks. Some people are too
[25:58.740 --> 26:03.460]  damn cheap to do that. They don't believe it, but it's good advice. I agree with it. It says, I use
[26:03.460 --> 26:10.180]  a pen style three in one. So I half fill the cap with storage solution and the cap and cap the
[26:10.180 --> 26:14.180]  meter. So you just pour some solution in there and then cap it. That's basically what I'm doing as
[26:14.180 --> 26:19.100]  well. The instruction book on mine says, if I keep the little pad inside of the lid wet, that it will
[26:19.100 --> 26:24.380]  store it safely forever. So that is what I try to do. Keep it moist. The rule of thumb is if it dries,
[26:24.380 --> 26:29.420]  it dies. So that is great advice. There is more to this. It says, I also have two different EC
[26:29.420 --> 26:35.420]  standards that I use in the same manner. I hope this wasn't too much of a who shot John, but I've
[26:35.420 --> 26:42.420]  been, I've seen the mismanagement of pH up close and it ain't pretty. Yes. How frustrating is it to
[26:42.780 --> 26:46.660]  fucking think that your pH is correct to think everything is right with your plants? You're
[26:46.660 --> 26:49.940]  struggling. What is wrong with these fucking plants? They're turning yellow. They look angry at
[26:49.940 --> 26:54.020]  me. My pH is cool. I've been watering. The room is great. And then you go and check your
[26:54.020 --> 26:58.860]  equipment and your pH pen is way the fuck off. And you've been doing work to fix the nutrients to
[26:58.860 --> 27:03.260]  make things correct and your tools were failing you. Yeah, that can really mess up a garden, really
[27:03.260 --> 27:07.580]  piss you off, really drive you crazy. So I appreciate this message. I'm glad that you sent
[27:07.580 --> 27:12.980]  this. Then it says, thank you for taking the time to read this and helping us all become better
[27:12.980 --> 27:17.260]  growers. You are very welcome. Thank you. Thank you for trusting me. And thank you for listening.
[27:17.300 --> 27:21.740]  And also thank you for contributing to the show. This was a great topic. Great message, a great
[27:21.740 --> 27:26.180]  update. We've been talking about pH pens for several episodes. So this one was great to get on
[27:26.180 --> 27:31.620]  here. Then it wraps up with by the way, has anyone ever told you that your delivery is similar to Jim
[27:31.620 --> 27:37.900]  Rome with that voice, you could do a podcast radio show on any topic. A lot of people have said I
[27:37.900 --> 27:41.380]  sound like Jim Rome. It's been a long time since I've Googled the dude to see what he sounds like.
[27:41.380 --> 27:46.460]  I don't know that I saw it or heard it the last time I Googled, but that's just me. I appreciate
[27:46.460 --> 27:51.020]  that you were comparing me to Jim Rome. He seems successful. He's got a lot of shit out there. So I
[27:51.020 --> 27:55.540]  must be doing something right. And I enjoy that you think I could do a podcast or radio show on any
[27:55.540 --> 27:59.860]  topic, but I don't give a shit about much else to do a show. So it's cannabis. That's all we've got
[27:59.860 --> 28:04.540]  this passion for. I might be able to do a drum show. But why do you what do you talk about when it
[28:04.540 --> 28:09.860]  comes to drums? You just got to play the damn things. Then it says stay iri. Then I'm not sure if
[28:09.860 --> 28:13.980]  I'm supposed to read this part. But it says I lost my mom and stepmom within the last two years. So I
[28:13.980 --> 28:19.980]  give them spiritual hugs, man bless you for that. Big hug to you big fist bump to you. Thank you for
[28:20.020 --> 28:24.740]  contributing to the show. And I'm sorry I lost both of your moms. That's miserable. But uh, man, keep
[28:24.740 --> 28:29.260]  your head up. Keep smiling. If you need anything. Give me a message. Love to help you out. Big
[28:29.260 --> 28:33.300]  shout out. You did not say that you want your name said so I'm not going to read your name here on the
