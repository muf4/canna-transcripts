[00:04.220 --> 00:11.220]  Oh shit, Rasta Jeff in the house.
[00:11.220 --> 00:18.220]  This baby hits 88 miles per hour.
[00:18.220 --> 00:21.220]  You're gonna see some serious shit.
[00:21.220 --> 00:22.220]  Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit.
[00:22.220 --> 00:23.220]  Man, what you gonna do now?
[00:23.220 --> 00:25.220]  What we gonna do right here is go back.
[00:25.220 --> 00:26.220]  Before you going back.
[00:26.220 --> 00:27.220]  Way back.
[00:27.220 --> 00:30.220]  As we go a little something like this.
[00:30.220 --> 00:32.220]  Welcome back, Podcast World.
[00:32.220 --> 00:37.220]  It's Thursday and that means it's time for another throwback Thursday episode of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:37.220 --> 00:41.220]  Before I get into this long block of episodes, let me make a couple of quick disclaimers.
[00:41.220 --> 00:47.220]  If I mention any giveaways, any advertising or any promotions, all of that stuff has expired.
[00:47.220 --> 00:49.220]  There are no promos, no giveaways in these old episodes.
[00:49.220 --> 00:52.220]  I want to thank you guys for listening to these long blocks of episodes.
[00:52.220 --> 00:56.220]  And with no further ado, here's a block of old episodes of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:56.220 --> 01:14.610]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[01:14.610 --> 01:17.610]  It's time for episode number 116 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:17.610 --> 01:21.610]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[01:21.610 --> 01:22.610]  That's right.
[01:22.610 --> 01:26.610]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber,
[01:26.610 --> 01:30.610]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[01:30.610 --> 01:33.610]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[01:33.610 --> 01:35.610]  I'm your host, my friends, call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:35.610 --> 01:36.610]  I want to thank you guys for joining me.
[01:36.610 --> 01:38.610]  Like always, I hope you got a fat blunt.
[01:38.610 --> 01:39.610]  Hope you got a dab.
[01:39.610 --> 01:40.610]  Hope you got the vaporizer going.
[01:40.610 --> 01:45.610]  Hope you got something going into your head right now, putting some THC and or some CBD into your body.
[01:45.610 --> 01:47.610]  Hope you're getting blazed as shit.
[01:47.610 --> 01:50.610]  Everybody at this table is red-eyed, got a good smile on their face.
[01:50.610 --> 01:52.610]  I've got a nice group of people over here today.
[01:52.610 --> 01:53.610]  Sitting to my left is my new friend, Danny.
[01:53.610 --> 01:54.610]  I want to welcome you to the show.
[01:54.610 --> 01:55.610]  How you doing, buddy?
[01:55.610 --> 01:56.610]  Talk into the microphone for me, please.
[01:56.610 --> 01:57.610]  Good, good.
[01:57.610 --> 01:59.610]  I'm going to have to remind everyone to talk into a microphone.
[01:59.610 --> 02:00.610]  Everyone's all red-eyed and dabbed out.
[02:00.610 --> 02:01.610]  It's been a long fucking day, man.
[02:01.610 --> 02:02.610]  It has been a long day.
[02:02.610 --> 02:04.610]  Did you go to Boulder last night or today?
[02:04.610 --> 02:05.610]  Went last night.
[02:05.610 --> 02:06.610]  Went last night.
[02:06.610 --> 02:07.610]  Went to Boulder and Denver yesterday.
[02:07.610 --> 02:08.610]  Nice, nice.
[02:08.610 --> 02:09.610]  Are you new to Colorado?
[02:09.610 --> 02:11.610]  Yeah, just flew in from New York on Saturday.
[02:11.610 --> 02:12.610]  New York.
[02:12.610 --> 02:13.610]  Are you staying or are you just visiting?
[02:13.610 --> 02:18.610]  Just visiting right now, trying to make some moves out here.
[02:18.610 --> 02:19.610]  Trying to make some moves.
[02:19.610 --> 02:20.610]  Well, it'd be cool to have you.
[02:20.610 --> 02:21.610]  I like your company, bro.
[02:21.610 --> 02:22.610]  You're a cool dude, so I hope you make it out here.
[02:22.610 --> 02:23.610]  Good luck.
[02:23.610 --> 02:24.610]  Thanks, dude.
[02:24.610 --> 02:25.610]  Likewise.
[02:25.610 --> 02:26.610]  Right on.
[02:26.610 --> 02:29.610]  Sitting to his left, did you notice how I had to fucking see which direction that was?
[02:29.610 --> 02:30.610]  Oh, my gosh.
[02:30.610 --> 02:31.610]  This is going to be a fun show.
[02:31.610 --> 02:35.610]  Sitting to his left is a repeat offender, a return guest, our good friend, Joe Buzzy.
[02:35.610 --> 02:36.610]  Welcome back, brother.
[02:36.610 --> 02:37.610]  How you doing?
[02:37.610 --> 02:38.610]  Yo, what's happening?
[02:38.610 --> 02:39.610]  Good to see you again.
[02:39.610 --> 02:40.610]  Yeah, no problem.
[02:40.610 --> 02:41.610]  Thanks for having me.
[02:41.610 --> 02:42.610]  Glad you showed up.
[02:42.610 --> 02:43.610]  Joe showed up and rolled a couple of joints, lit them up, tasty stuff.
[02:43.610 --> 02:45.610]  What are we smoking in that joint right there?
[02:45.610 --> 02:48.610]  This one right here is a mystery cush plant.
[02:48.610 --> 02:54.610]  It is some unknown bag seed that was grown and kind of smells lemony, cushy.
[02:54.610 --> 02:55.610]  Mystery lemon cush?
[02:55.610 --> 02:56.610]  Mystery cush, yeah.
[02:56.610 --> 02:57.610]  Why not?
[02:57.610 --> 02:58.610]  Sounds good to me.
[02:58.610 --> 02:59.610]  Let's smoke that shit whenever you're ready.
[02:59.610 --> 03:00.610]  Thanks for coming again, bro.
[03:00.610 --> 03:01.610]  No problem.
[03:01.610 --> 03:02.610]  Awesome.
[03:02.610 --> 03:05.610]  Sitting to his left, sort of to my left-ish a little bit still, is my new friend-
[03:05.610 --> 03:06.610]  Diagonal, yeah.
[03:06.610 --> 03:07.610]  Yeah, diagonal left.
[03:07.610 --> 03:08.610]  Caesar, right?
[03:08.610 --> 03:09.610]  Yeah, Caesar.
[03:09.610 --> 03:10.610]  Awesome, man.
[03:10.610 --> 03:11.610]  Talk into the microphone a little bit more for me.
[03:11.610 --> 03:12.610]  There you go, right up there, news reporter style.
[03:12.610 --> 03:13.610]  Looks good on you.
[03:13.610 --> 03:14.610]  I think I could do it, right?
[03:14.610 --> 03:18.610]  You took a dab earlier and you said it was going to wreck you.
[03:18.610 --> 03:19.610]  Are you not a heavy dabber?
[03:19.610 --> 03:20.610]  No, no, no, I really don't.
[03:20.610 --> 03:22.610]  I just kind of smoke a lot of flour.
[03:22.610 --> 03:23.610]  Well, thanks for-
[03:23.610 --> 03:24.610]  I'm a flour guy.
[03:24.610 --> 03:25.610]  Are you from New York also?
[03:25.610 --> 03:26.610]  Yeah.
[03:26.610 --> 03:27.610]  You got that New York accent coming with you?
[03:27.610 --> 03:28.610]  Can't escape it.
[03:28.610 --> 03:29.610]  Yeah, no.
[03:29.610 --> 03:30.610]  It doesn't go away.
[03:30.610 --> 03:31.610]  It's great for the listeners.
[03:31.610 --> 03:33.610]  They get tired of hearing this Colorado plain voice, so they'll enjoy something new.
[03:33.610 --> 03:35.610]  So are you staying or are you just coming to visit?
[03:35.610 --> 03:36.610]  No, no, just coming to visit.
[03:36.610 --> 03:39.610]  I mean, on vacation, good times with better people, you know?
[03:39.610 --> 03:40.610]  Nice, better people.
[03:40.610 --> 03:42.610]  More relaxed vibe here than on the coast?
[03:42.610 --> 03:43.610]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:43.610 --> 03:44.610]  I'm sure of that.
[03:44.610 --> 03:45.610]  I've been out there.
[03:45.610 --> 03:47.610]  I spend usually 12 hours a day, six days a week in Manhattan, so-
[03:47.610 --> 03:48.610]  Holy shit.
[03:48.610 --> 03:49.610]  It gets exhausting.
[03:49.610 --> 03:51.610]  How much does weed cost in Manhattan?
[03:51.610 --> 03:53.610]  It's like 50 for an eighth.
[03:53.610 --> 03:54.610]  I mean-
[03:54.610 --> 03:55.610]  Is it any good?
[03:55.610 --> 03:56.610]  Hit or miss.
[03:56.610 --> 03:57.610]  Hit or miss.
[03:57.610 --> 03:58.610]  All right, yeah, that's what's got to suck about it.
[03:58.610 --> 04:01.610]  You're going to spend that 50 and it's either going to be, oh yeah, or it's going to be,
[04:01.610 --> 04:02.610]  aw man.
[04:02.610 --> 04:03.610]  Yeah.
[04:03.610 --> 04:04.610]  So you got delivery service where you are?
[04:04.610 --> 04:07.610]  No, I usually just go by my cousin's house and grab it.
[04:07.610 --> 04:09.610]  Make him do all the footwork.
[04:09.610 --> 04:10.610]  Nice.
[04:10.610 --> 04:11.610]  Shout out to your cousin.
[04:11.610 --> 04:12.610]  Don't say his name because he's a criminal.
[04:14.610 --> 04:18.610]  I don't want to end up in a ditch or a river for fucking saying your cousin's name on here.
[04:18.610 --> 04:20.610]  No, no, you rebels and that shit.
[04:21.610 --> 04:23.610]  Well, man, thanks for coming on the show while you're out here visiting.
[04:23.610 --> 04:24.610]  Thanks for taking some visit time to come hang out.
[04:24.610 --> 04:25.610]  Thanks for having me.
[04:25.610 --> 04:26.610]  I appreciate it.
[04:26.610 --> 04:28.610]  Sitting to his right, which is directly in front of me.
[04:28.610 --> 04:29.610]  Oh, I remember.
[04:29.610 --> 04:31.610]  I have two names in my head I want to call you.
[04:31.610 --> 04:32.610]  I want to say Audrey, am I correct?
[04:32.610 --> 04:33.610]  No.
[04:33.610 --> 04:34.610]  I'm Audrey.
[04:34.610 --> 04:35.610]  Yes.
[04:35.610 --> 04:36.610]  Fuck yeah.
[04:36.610 --> 04:37.610]  I should have went with that.
[04:37.610 --> 04:38.610]  I doubted myself.
[04:38.610 --> 04:39.610]  I don't know why.
[04:39.610 --> 04:40.610]  Lindsey, thanks for coming.
[04:40.610 --> 04:41.610]  Yeah, absolutely.
[04:41.610 --> 04:42.610]  You live here now, right?
[04:42.610 --> 04:43.610]  Yeah, I do actually.
[04:43.610 --> 04:44.610]  I just moved out here with Chris when we came across.
[04:44.610 --> 04:45.610]  How many days ago?
[04:45.610 --> 04:48.610]  We've been here since like December 28th.
[04:48.610 --> 04:50.610]  Okay, so a couple of weeks-ish.
[04:50.610 --> 04:55.610]  Yeah, we were all over the place in Colorado just kind of seeing everything and then we
[04:55.610 --> 04:57.610]  kind of like settled down in Pueblo for a little bit.
[04:57.610 --> 04:58.610]  Nice.
[04:58.610 --> 04:59.610]  Yeah.
[04:59.610 --> 05:01.610]  You guys actually landed in our friend Sloppy's old house, right?
[05:01.610 --> 05:02.610]  Yes.
[05:02.610 --> 05:03.610]  That's awesome.
[05:03.610 --> 05:04.610]  Awesome.
[05:04.610 --> 05:05.610]  So they're sharing a microphone.
[05:05.610 --> 05:09.610]  You guys sitting to her, that's your left but my right kind of, is our friend Chris who
[05:09.610 --> 05:11.610]  is actually also known as Bobo Blaster Co.
[05:11.610 --> 05:12.610]  Yes.
[05:12.610 --> 05:13.610]  Hello, hello.
[05:13.610 --> 05:14.610]  How you doing, bro?
[05:14.610 --> 05:15.610]  It's me.
[05:15.610 --> 05:16.610]  Yeah, I do Bobo Blaster Co.
[05:16.610 --> 05:17.610]  If people don't know that, or Chris.
[05:17.610 --> 05:18.610]  Yeah, I do the e-mail tables and stuff, stuff like that.
[05:18.610 --> 05:19.610]  E-mail tables, shelves.
[05:19.610 --> 05:20.610]  Shelves, all types of stuff.
[05:20.610 --> 05:21.610]  Just cases, Pelican cases.
[05:21.610 --> 05:22.610]  I have cases.
[05:22.610 --> 05:23.610]  Yeah, I have some weird other stuff too.
[05:23.610 --> 05:24.610]  I have like a little Halo helmet set.
[05:24.610 --> 05:25.610]  It's coming out pretty soon.
[05:25.610 --> 05:26.610]  I have a lot of stuff.
[05:26.610 --> 05:27.610]  I have a lot of stuff.
[05:27.610 --> 05:28.610]  I have a lot of stuff.
[05:29.610 --> 05:36.070]  I have a couple little ideas that are in the works.
[05:36.070 --> 05:41.790]  He's gonna make me a small e-mail for traveling purposes so that if I were to be in somebody's
[05:41.790 --> 05:43.990]  vehicle, maybe there could be some I haven't heard…
[05:43.990 --> 05:44.990]  I actually have one.
[05:44.990 --> 05:46.790]  It's funny, we were just talking about that.
[05:46.790 --> 05:49.810]  I actually have a car version that I'm trying to do.
[05:49.810 --> 05:50.810]  That would be…
[05:50.810 --> 05:51.810]  A DC version.
[05:51.810 --> 05:52.810]  For camping.
[05:52.810 --> 05:56.150]  For when you're camping and you're parked and you want to take a dab in the car that
[05:56.150 --> 05:58.150]  Yes, not not driving
[05:58.990 --> 06:02.430]  That would never happen by it to any of the professional people in this room
[06:03.070 --> 06:05.070]  Awesome. Thanks
[06:05.110 --> 06:08.150]  Right, right. So thanks for coming man. Grab a mic if you're gonna shout
[06:08.590 --> 06:12.330]  It's cool. I'll just keep reminding you guys. These guys are new to podcast. We didn't have enough mics for everybody
[06:12.330 --> 06:16.870]  So they're sharing mics. We're doing it kind of radio station style or whatever like a board show style, I think
[06:17.590 --> 06:20.590]  Yeah, just grab a mic. You slap the guy next to you. Steal his mic if you feel the urge
[06:20.590 --> 06:22.590]  It's Kanye, don't worry about it.
[06:22.590 --> 06:24.590]  Yeah, Kanye that bitch. I got something to say. Fuck your thoughts.
[06:26.150 --> 06:31.150]  It's gonna be a fun show you guys. We took plenty of dabs before we got started.
[06:31.150 --> 06:33.150]  So I want to give you a big shout out dude
[06:33.430 --> 06:40.830]  Chris Bobo Blastico sent me the coolest dab table of several months ago. I've been dabbing on it on a daily basis. I take
[06:41.390 --> 06:46.950]  I'm gonna say ten dabs off that table. Yeah, it definitely looks like it got work. I'm happy. It has been used
[06:46.950 --> 06:50.910]  It's been put to use. I'm happy to see that. All my periscope friends have seen it
[06:50.910 --> 06:55.270]  Anybody that's watching my YouTube videos have seen it. It is still going man
[06:55.270 --> 06:59.830]  You sent that thing to me months ago. It was warm when you sent it because in the periscope video I'm wearing shorts
[06:59.830 --> 07:00.310]  Yeah
[07:00.310 --> 07:03.230]  It's warm and he sent it to me and that thing is still rocking
[07:03.430 --> 07:07.070]  If you say three months ago four months ago at ten dabs a day
[07:07.270 --> 07:12.350]  Whatever kind of math that is that's a lot of dabs. Everyone looked at Joe. That's really funny. Did you compute?
[07:12.950 --> 07:14.950]  Yes, that is accurate
[07:18.950 --> 07:22.710]  So it has stood the test of time the table has stood up I appreciate the work
[07:22.710 --> 07:29.670]  I'm gonna give you a huge shout out as it burniture dot big cartel.com. Yes. Yes go there check that shit out
[07:30.070 --> 07:36.070]  Tell him that you heard about it on the ivory or the girl from your heart podcast and he will do something special for you
[07:36.070 --> 07:38.210]  He'll make sure you get hooked to the first order
[07:38.750 --> 07:41.750]  Definitely you can DM me if you want custom orders and stuff, too
[07:41.750 --> 07:48.190]  If you got ideas or thoughts or stuff, you might want to build definitely DM me on Instagram at Bobo blaster Co
[07:48.910 --> 07:53.230]  Yeah, or definitely send me a message at the burniture I asked you
[07:53.230 --> 07:58.950]  I asked you what you could make into an email for me and your answer was it's more about what I can't make into it
[07:58.950 --> 07:59.630]  Yes for you
[07:59.630 --> 08:04.430]  So if you've got the funds and you think you want to turn into an email he can probably do it if you're patient
[08:04.430 --> 08:06.430]  Yes
[08:07.550 --> 08:10.030]  That's what I wanted was an Nintendo an old Nintendo
[08:10.790 --> 08:16.790]  But then I saw it done so I didn't want it anymore. That's the thing. That's what's hard about this. Everybody's doing it now
[08:16.790 --> 08:18.630]  It's it's an easy thing
[08:18.630 --> 08:25.030]  If you really know if you know, you're if you're an average electrician and you can kind of understand some electrician
[08:25.030 --> 08:27.030]  You can probably make it and there's a billion
[08:27.710 --> 08:30.230]  DDI I mean di. Oh my god
[08:32.390 --> 08:34.390]  Yeah

[08:58.470 --> 09:02.430]  Hitman short stack these guys were laughing at me because there's like a gram and a half of reclaims

[09:32.670 --> 09:35.990]  These guys dab as hard as you do when you see them at trade shows

[09:38.470 --> 09:43.950]  Get shit made in America support the economy. Don't buy glass made by a little kid with no shoes and no protective eyewear
[09:43.950 --> 09:49.670]  No glasses a little dude didn't get a lunch break got a fucking whip up against his ass all day. I'm just kidding
[09:50.510 --> 09:52.790]  That's true though. It's possibly true
[09:59.390 --> 10:01.390]  Okay
[10:01.630 --> 10:04.750]  Into another topic you segwayed for me. Thank you. That's fucking beautiful
[10:05.350 --> 10:07.110]  We talked about this on another episode
[10:07.110 --> 10:10.110]  But there's a whole new group of friends here that are actually more involved in the cannabis industry
[10:10.550 --> 10:13.230]  Have you guys seen the mothership rig that sold for?
[10:24.310 --> 10:30.670]  Rage is beautiful beautiful piece. Okay outrageous like crazy number like so
[10:31.470 --> 10:34.390]  Yeah, well first off I'm a huge Sagan fanboy so
[10:40.270 --> 10:44.750]  But that's just outlandish, okay, so say you won the Powerball
[10:53.190 --> 10:57.110]  The Powerball would you throw down a hundred and one thousand dollars on a glass rig still
[11:01.430 --> 11:06.710]  Please live with me everything so if you want a hundred if you want that billion dollars you just
[11:21.470 --> 11:23.470]  Most of our listeners are right there with you
[11:23.910 --> 11:26.710]  If you're not take a dab right now, so the one Joe says makes sense
[11:27.830 --> 11:29.830]  Quick, let's hear it Joe
[11:31.670 --> 11:35.230]  So was that mothership event in
[11:35.870 --> 11:41.350]  Like for charity of any kind was it all because it was all like silent auction style
[11:41.350 --> 11:46.310]  I think the charity was Scott Debbie's fucking pocket is what I think that charity was for hi
[11:46.470 --> 11:50.710]  Yeah, I did not know I don't know that there was a charity involved
[11:50.710 --> 11:55.930]  Only way I could somehow justify spending a hundred thousand dollars on a glass piece is if you could somehow write it off
[11:55.930 --> 12:01.410]  And if it was involved with a charity that might be the way that they finagle it that would be I don't know
[12:01.850 --> 12:03.850]  Unfortunately, I think it was at
[12:04.330 --> 12:09.130]  it was at one of the trade shows that happened on the West Coast it was either Vegas or the West Coast and
[12:10.130 --> 12:16.630]  Mothership had a huge booth there and instead of this is what I think what I was told by somebody instead of selling mothership rigs
[12:16.650 --> 12:21.210]  They've learned that they can make a lot more money by creating demand at these events because people are hyped
[12:21.330 --> 12:26.530]  So that's how they got a hundred and one instead of a hundred is because two people were fighting and one dude said 101
[12:26.770 --> 12:28.770]  one guy said a hundred and
[12:28.810 --> 12:30.490]  101 got it
[12:30.490 --> 12:33.890]  So I'm pretty sure it's just you go to the events and I've done it myself
[12:33.890 --> 12:39.010]  I've bought overpriced fucking rigs at events because it's in front of me and it's hyped and it sounds like a good deal and
[12:39.010 --> 12:44.130]  Instead of it being 1200. It's only 950 today. So I feel like I got a sweet-ass deal and you buy it
[12:44.130 --> 12:46.130]  Then you get home. You're like, oh fuck. I just bought this rig
[12:46.650 --> 12:54.290]  We've also done something like that before but that's how you create the hype this dude next to me holds up his
[12:55.330 --> 13:01.330]  This show is sponsored by hitman glass. We're talking about mothership right now. But dude this rig is nice. This rig comes from illusions glass
[13:01.330 --> 13:06.450]  It's the ill glass flux capacitor. It is the right size. It's got a quartz banger on it
[13:06.450 --> 13:10.130]  I like the mouthpiece on it and it's sturdy enough for the email. So nice purchase, dude
[13:11.130 --> 13:14.930]  A half off actually had illusions right see boulder. They got him on the fucking hype
[13:14.930 --> 13:17.770]  They marked it up what it should be and sold it to you at half price
[13:19.330 --> 13:24.610]  That's a good rig I like it I like how thick the glasses you can tell it's not made by some Chinese kid with no
[13:24.610 --> 13:26.610]  protective eyewear
[13:27.850 --> 13:31.890]  At ill glass so we can all agree that that rig was a little bit overpriced, right?
[13:33.810 --> 13:36.390]  Even the even the Sagan fanboy over here is like yeah
[13:36.830 --> 13:39.790]  Any rig over like say realistically
[13:40.590 --> 13:42.590]  $2,500 overpriced like I
[13:43.430 --> 13:46.310]  100% understand that you're paying for the
[13:47.150 --> 13:53.270]  craftsmanship and the dedication that the person has put into learning and perfecting an art form and
[13:53.550 --> 13:55.550]  That's what you really
[13:57.910 --> 14:04.070]  But I'm just trying to think of a realistic number that isn't affected by market value
[14:04.390 --> 14:07.390]  Like the value the markets putting it kind of depends on
[14:07.750 --> 14:11.910]  I'm sure everybody in this room makes a different paycheck and it kind of depends on oh, yeah
[14:12.430 --> 14:15.310]  That's too much for a rig and different people will be like, yeah
[14:15.310 --> 14:18.830]  I pay that for a rig and it just kind of depends on where you are and there have been times in my life
[14:18.830 --> 14:21.110]  Where I'd have been like a hundred bucks for a glass pipe. Fuck you
[14:21.110 --> 14:26.030]  But now they're I'm like sitting here hitting this hitman short stack that we all know is not a hundred bucks
[14:26.270 --> 14:32.630]  So just times have changed and people change so it's all it's all what is it subjective like what's over private?
[14:32.630 --> 14:35.590]  It's been over a thousand or two thousand bucks for a piece of glass
[14:35.590 --> 14:37.790]  You could drop and break and this rig over here
[14:37.790 --> 14:42.110]  This one is closer to the four or five and it hits like a boss and it's a hash pipe still no matter how much
[14:42.110 --> 14:44.110]  You pay for it how pretty it is. It's a hash pipe
[14:45.670 --> 14:49.190]  The only way I could feel like I would justify even spending a
[14:50.230 --> 14:53.850]  Reasonable amount of money if you're buying it for a sculpture like aspect of it
[14:55.830 --> 14:57.830]  We just went to
[14:57.830 --> 15:03.710]  Lazy line like the banjo Joe P. It's like more of a art piece than anything. It's a sculpture
[15:03.710 --> 15:08.670]  It's every like even that I don't even think is anywhere near a hundred right, right?
[15:08.670 --> 15:12.470]  But there are so many things I could buy a car with I could buy four cars
[15:12.470 --> 15:14.470]  But I'm really nice car for my house
[15:14.630 --> 15:18.430]  Like I can buy a college education with that kind of money. Well a week or two at college
[15:19.350 --> 15:25.370]  You could realistically own a skyscraper in Detroit with that much you could own fucking Detroit
[15:28.830 --> 15:34.750]  I'm sorry Detroit. That was rude. But I mean you could buy a few blocks probably. All right
[15:49.510 --> 15:51.510]  Why are rigs
[15:52.110 --> 15:54.110]  $25,000 yeah
[15:54.110 --> 16:00.190]  There are a few there's one there's like maybe an SD Rhino rig I'd pay good money for and probably a couple of coil pieces
[16:00.190 --> 16:03.870]  That I pay good money for but then you guys ever have that feeling when you're like
[16:03.870 --> 16:07.950]  I'm gonna go buy something you get to the store and you grab it you carry it up to the cash register and the lady
[16:07.950 --> 16:09.510]  Tells you how much it is
[16:09.510 --> 16:12.390]  Something inside. She's like I just want to fucking put it back
[16:12.590 --> 16:15.630]  Like I have to take that much money out of my pocket and give it to you
[16:15.630 --> 16:17.710]  Like I was cool with it until like this moment
[16:18.230 --> 16:20.230]  like no
[16:20.230 --> 16:22.230]  I
[16:22.510 --> 16:24.510]  Almost bought a mothership for
[16:24.510 --> 16:27.190]  2,500 bucks and the day before I drove to Denver to go get it
[16:27.190 --> 16:31.670]  I woke up and I was like I have to take all these hundred dollar bills and give them to somebody right now like it
[16:31.670 --> 16:33.670]  Was a cool idea
[16:43.910 --> 16:48.450]  So needless to say I came to my senses and did not purchase a $2,500 mothership
[16:48.850 --> 16:52.610]  There's just something that I can't do that it feels weird that's a lot of money
[16:52.810 --> 16:55.610]  This is gonna be the most expensive rig on the table for a long time
[16:55.610 --> 16:57.810]  And this was actually sent to me by our friends at hitman glass
[16:58.010 --> 17:01.490]  So this this will remain the priciest rig on the table for quite a while
[17:01.490 --> 17:08.490]  I'm I don't want anybody to think that I'm hating on these dudes who are making bank selling their glass
[17:08.490 --> 17:09.890]  No, it's amazing and awesome
[17:09.890 --> 17:15.690]  That's it's great that these guys can support their families and their kids are going to college now because this dude made art and it's sold
[17:16.290 --> 17:22.010]  When you approach it from okay, see I was never I was not approaching my argument from the art standpoint
[17:22.090 --> 17:24.090]  I was approaching it from the this is a
[17:34.650 --> 17:38.810]  How pretty it is which so I talked about it on another episode
[17:38.810 --> 17:43.610]  But let's let's look at a picture of it since we're we're all gonna this other people that listen to that episode might be listening
[17:43.610 --> 17:45.210]  To this one and didn't hear that episode
[17:45.210 --> 17:48.730]  So let's go to Instagram right quick and I want to pull up a picture and share it with everybody so we can all see
[17:48.730 --> 17:50.730]  it together
[17:50.730 --> 17:55.630]  Crap I search for a lot of stuff here. We're just gonna go hashtag mothership and it'll come up. Trust me
[18:01.730 --> 18:04.690]  So do you can we agree Wow, I don't see it yet
[18:04.690 --> 18:08.150]  Can we all agree that it looks like something that maybe Tim Burton would have made?
[18:08.870 --> 18:13.830]  Or maybe if Les Claypool had become a glassblower maybe Les Claypool would have made this thing
[18:13.830 --> 18:15.830]  There's a picture of it here, but it's not the picture. I'm looking for
[18:16.310 --> 18:21.870]  Yeah, shut up to Primus all day there. They played yesterday in California and I heard the show was amazing
[18:21.870 --> 18:23.670]  So let's look at this piece right here
[18:23.670 --> 18:27.150]  It is got on the top of the mouthpiece is supposed to be a moon
[18:27.670 --> 18:30.550]  Then it has got I think that color is called stardust
[18:30.670 --> 18:36.550]  But it's got other stuff in it with this like metallic iridescent glittery shit that just drives my eyes crazy
[18:36.550 --> 18:38.550]  I can't even focus on it properly
[18:38.950 --> 18:40.630]  then it is
[18:40.630 --> 18:45.470]  It's a Fabergé egg underneath that but it's made with such dark glass
[18:45.470 --> 18:49.630]  You can't see through it to see the proper shape of the egg and it looks like a hand grenade to me
[18:50.030 --> 18:52.030]  You guys agree with that?
[18:53.590 --> 18:58.350]  It's too fucking much it's kind of gaudy it is it's like
[18:59.150 --> 19:02.950]  Reflected stained glass on a lake that's rippling. Yeah
[19:03.670 --> 19:06.590]  It's nice, but I mean it's so ugly at the same time
[19:08.710 --> 19:10.350]  Mothership is known
[19:10.350 --> 19:12.870]  101 that's that extra one. They still got a taxes on it
[19:13.150 --> 19:18.990]  Mothership is known for really like smooth sleek tight glass with like no extra shit on it and really nice function
[19:18.990 --> 19:21.030]  Yeah clear function like a clear color
[19:21.030 --> 19:24.470]  Maybe like a the piss yellow lemon drop or the pink or blue
[19:24.670 --> 19:31.150]  The azure blue is really nice and this thing is just gaudy and overdone in my opinion this little moon down here
[19:31.150 --> 19:37.270]  They sent that to the moon to space in a weather balloon. Oh, yeah. He did a whole set of pennies
[19:37.430 --> 19:40.590]  Yeah, yeah, so it's got these moons around it
[19:40.590 --> 19:44.510]  It's got a bunch of moons attached to it and that's supposed to be the actual
[19:44.550 --> 19:47.950]  Phases of the moon if you'd spin it around it goes through the moon phases
[19:47.950 --> 19:53.670]  It looks like they made a cheap bong and glued a bunch of fucking moons
[19:55.310 --> 19:57.750]  I want to buy it and glue a little rocket ship to it
[19:57.750 --> 19:59.750]  I
[20:04.510 --> 20:10.470]  Being rude now and there goes Russell Jeff's custom I read genetics mothership not coming in the mail
[20:14.190 --> 20:18.410]  They can send me one of the racecar series any day of the week that blue racecar is dope
[20:18.410 --> 20:25.170]  The there's a green racecar series one. I got cash in my pocket. Somebody bought the red one up right away. Of course. It's beautiful
[20:25.690 --> 20:30.230]  Gorgeous but that racecar series I will take it anything. That's not a fixie for mothership
[20:30.230 --> 20:36.110]  I'm happy see what I want to say is the reason that cosmic piece gets away with it is because it is a collab
[20:36.410 --> 20:38.810]  Because it's not a straight-up mothership piece
[20:38.810 --> 20:43.670]  It's a mothership base and then an artist went to town on it went the fuck to town on it
[20:43.670 --> 20:45.670]  And so that's why it is what it is and
[20:46.770 --> 20:49.450]  Never gets smoked out of no they were dabbing out of it, bro
[20:51.090 --> 20:53.570]  Pictures on Instagram of these dudes dabbing out of it
[20:55.770 --> 20:59.770]  A hundred grand on a rig like how often you really gonna use that?
[21:05.810 --> 21:09.890]  My hand would be on it while you dab out of it my hand would be on it while you dab out of it
[21:09.890 --> 21:11.890]  I'd be like no I got it
[21:12.770 --> 21:14.770]  Yeah, stick your head in the case
[21:15.690 --> 21:18.050]  It's a padded room you go into to take dabs
[21:18.530 --> 21:23.810]  Yeah, all right, so you guys check out this rig if you'd go to mothership glass on Instagram
[21:23.810 --> 21:25.810]  You'll see what we're talking about. It is redonkulous
[21:27.010 --> 21:31.770]  Um also here's something I've been seeing on social media sites. Have you guys seen?
[21:32.370 --> 21:33.410]  the
[21:33.410 --> 21:37.930]  Super clear hash that somebody made super clear. It is clear as
[21:38.650 --> 21:41.730]  Glass in which in which state are you talking about?
[21:42.250 --> 21:44.750]  not not not United States like
[21:45.490 --> 21:52.930]  Which which phase is the hash in so they're holding it in their hand with a rubber glove and behind them is an across
[21:53.250 --> 21:54.890]  international vac oven and
[21:54.890 --> 21:59.930]  They just hold it in front of the camera took the picture and there was no caption and the picture went up and stayed up
[21:59.930 --> 22:03.810]  For like three or four days and people went nuts over this hash because it was as clear as this rig
[22:04.170 --> 22:07.370]  It was super clear. You guys didn't see it. No, can I see this?
[22:07.490 --> 22:10.690]  Well, I'm just gonna ruin all your guys's fun. It was ice
[22:11.330 --> 22:13.410]  Or so it was just straight up a piece of ice
[22:13.410 --> 22:18.410]  But since they wore a rubber glove and took a picture of it in front of a vac oven and didn't post anything
[22:18.770 --> 22:23.330]  Everybody's mind is when look at that clear hash and everybody just jerked off and had a fucking orgasm to it
[22:28.050 --> 22:31.850]  Yeah, so many of my friends I'm I'm a lot of people's cannabis expert
[22:31.850 --> 22:35.130]  You know what? I mean? I'm their weed guy and people were sending me the picture all day like is this real?
[22:35.130 --> 22:37.370]  What is this? Is this real and finally I messaged them
[22:37.730 --> 22:40.010]  Yeah, like where can you find this how much a gram?
[22:40.250 --> 22:44.970]  So I messaged him I was like, what is that exactly? It looks like ice to me and they're like it's ice
[22:45.570 --> 22:47.570]  Okay, nice. Good call
[22:49.090 --> 22:50.730]  There's no comment or anything
[22:50.730 --> 22:55.690]  They just posted the picture and they just let everybody assume and everybody's minds went right to oh my god
[22:55.690 --> 22:59.890]  Look at this hash because they saw rubber gloves in a vac oven and that's what you know
[22:59.890 --> 23:02.930]  If you see lotion in a Kleenex in your buddy's bedroom, you think he's jerking off
[23:02.930 --> 23:05.330]  It's if you got fucking vac oven and rubber gloves, you're making hash
[23:05.490 --> 23:08.870]  It's kind of just how it goes the girl in the room almost spit her water on me
[23:08.870 --> 23:11.970]  Just now the only female in the room almost lost her shit. I'm sorry
[23:14.810 --> 23:17.330]  That was good, all right, so we talked about that on the show yesterday
[23:17.330 --> 23:19.330]  But you guys are more in the loop a little bit the guys over here yesterday
[23:19.770 --> 23:24.410]  Our local dudes aren't as hip into the scene. No offense if you guys listen, and you know, I'm saying
[23:26.210 --> 23:32.110]  So you guys just moved here you guys got a brand new house you guys were spoiled because you moved into sloppy's house
[23:33.370 --> 23:38.090]  That may have already been equipped for growing if you had chosen to grow in there
[23:38.090 --> 23:41.810]  Yeah, a lot of people that are gonna move here aren't going to have that advantage
[23:41.930 --> 23:46.010]  So there's a few minutes left in the show that we can keep going for a few minutes
[23:46.010 --> 23:51.450]  Let's talk about things that if people were going to move to a house in Colorado and you plan to grow
[23:51.570 --> 23:54.490]  What are some things you should look at when you're looking for a house?
[23:55.050 --> 23:58.130]  Before you move in like have this in mind before I move here
[23:58.130 --> 24:00.490]  Look at this when you're looking at houses if you plan to grow there
[24:00.530 --> 24:04.930]  Like the first thing just to get it rolling like make sure you've got enough electricity coming into the house
[24:05.370 --> 24:08.090]  The power is really limited if you get an older house
[24:08.510 --> 24:14.810]  You may have like a 50 or an 80 amp maximum in your house my house. We could pull 200 amps here
[24:14.890 --> 24:17.630]  So we I'm in a nice big fancy residential area
[24:17.630 --> 24:21.550]  But some homes you can't pull enough power to run more than two or three or three or four lights
[24:21.550 --> 24:25.850]  Yeah, so definitely check out the electricity if you're gonna have an electrician come
[24:26.610 --> 24:31.570]  Here's a good segue into the next thing check out the landlord. That's something to really think about you
[24:31.570 --> 24:34.610]  Just rolled your eyes. You had a fucking experience. I can see it on your face
[24:39.570 --> 24:43.610]  So imagine if that dickhead landlord is at your front door and you've got to grow in the basement
[24:43.610 --> 24:47.970]  He wants to come in and do something and there's no keeping him out. You gotta make sure you got a good landlord
[24:48.970 --> 24:50.770]  Fortunately, my landlord lives in Michigan
[24:50.770 --> 24:53.890]  So they have been here once since I've moved in in the past like eight years
[24:54.370 --> 24:58.410]  They drive by when they came to visit their family. They're like the front yard looks great. Thank you
[25:00.890 --> 25:06.270]  So find a landlord if you can find one of those rental agencies that they rent you the house and they forget about you as
[25:06.270 --> 25:08.770]  Long as you send that check every month if you can find a place like that
[25:09.130 --> 25:16.650]  Those are rare in Colorado because there's because they are aware of what people are renting houses to do
[25:16.650 --> 25:18.530]  very true
[25:18.530 --> 25:24.290]  You really want to find like a local landlord if you are planning to grow
[25:24.850 --> 25:32.330]  It's very easy to grow legally here. There's no reason to grow illegally when it's so easy to have all your paperwork in order
[25:34.250 --> 25:36.250]  And then
[25:39.050 --> 25:43.850]  All right, yeah, yeah, there's a other things for your grow room to like
[25:45.810 --> 25:51.330]  What are you doing for your ventilation yes is your landlord cool with you modifying the house
[25:51.330 --> 25:54.690]  Oh, yeah, you might have to cut some ducting holes. Yeah you
[25:55.690 --> 26:02.270]  Environment is key. Think about how many rooms does the house have? Yeah, are you gonna have enough room to adequately grow?
[26:02.810 --> 26:04.810]  Don't have crazy expectations
[26:04.970 --> 26:06.970]  Not your two closets and
[26:20.170 --> 26:22.170]  Flower clones and moms
[26:22.170 --> 26:24.810]  I'm gonna breathe this other room and then you're like, oh shit
[26:32.210 --> 26:37.130]  So like Joe said have a good roommate or have a good landlord don't get any fucking roommates you're going weed
[26:37.130 --> 26:40.250]  That'll pay the other bills. Don't get any roommates. Don't do that
[26:40.250 --> 26:43.730]  That'll screw everything up angry roommates are one of the and no offense
[26:43.730 --> 26:47.670]  But angry girlfriends and angry roommates are one of the leading causes of garden failure
[26:48.270 --> 26:52.830]  Just ruined angry partners don't have another partner do it yourself get your own house set that shit up
[26:53.190 --> 26:58.590]  Another thing make sure there is access to water. You need to get plenty of water to your garden
[26:59.750 --> 27:04.850]  You're gonna need I say probably about five gallons of water per light every three days
[27:04.870 --> 27:09.670]  That's every thousand watt light. You'll need about five gallons of water every three days. That's in my experience
[27:09.830 --> 27:11.830]  If it's too hot, you're gonna have to get more water
[27:12.630 --> 27:18.150]  Find a place that you can control the temperature a lot of basements get really really cold and dank in the winter
[27:18.150 --> 27:19.470]  You're gonna think this is gonna be awesome
[27:19.470 --> 27:26.150]  But that coldness will give you powdery mildew that drastic change from hot to cold is a huge huge cause of powdery mildew
[27:26.150 --> 27:29.630]  The plants don't know what to do with that. They'll freak out. You'll get mold. You'll fuck up the whole crop
[27:30.230 --> 27:32.230]  Also a lot of the basements around here
[27:32.630 --> 27:34.630]  The basements are just dirty
[27:34.670 --> 27:39.550]  You would not want to grow in any basement around here until you kind of frame it out or build something in there
[27:39.550 --> 27:43.270]  So look and see how dirty how dusty how funky the place is check your pipes
[27:43.270 --> 27:45.750]  Make sure you're not gonna have any busting pipes in the basement
[27:45.750 --> 27:49.870]  I know I keep saying basements, but basements are the best place for a girl in my opinion
[27:50.230 --> 27:56.030]  The temperature is easier to maintain. Nobody goes down there. It's a little more easy to keep private. So
[27:56.870 --> 27:58.110]  Make sure it's not real dirty
[27:58.110 --> 28:02.850]  Make sure you got somewhere for the water to go make sure maybe you got a floor drain or a way to get rid
[28:02.850 --> 28:03.190]  Of the water
[28:03.190 --> 28:07.810]  Maybe if you got an old bathroom shower and all the shower down in the basement or an old toilet down there
[28:07.810 --> 28:10.410]  Make sure you just have somewhere to dispose of water because there will be water
[28:11.210 --> 28:13.730]  Make sure your neighbors aren't right on top of you
[28:14.050 --> 28:16.570]  My neighbors are a few feet away if they were any closer
[28:16.570 --> 28:22.450]  I would be uncomfortable having any blowers coming out of any windows. It wouldn't do it. So make sure your neighbors are cool
[28:23.130 --> 28:25.130]  Make sure you don't live next to any cops
[28:32.410 --> 28:34.930]  Or just bust it out right in front of the cops house
[28:34.930 --> 28:37.950]  And they'll never fucking notice because you'll be like why would that ass will grow there?
[28:37.950 --> 28:39.250]  They just carry in grow
[28:39.250 --> 28:40.850]  Here's another tip when you move in
[28:40.850 --> 28:46.930]  Don't go carrying in your grow lights and your hydro setup all at one time kind of wait for the if you can drive
[28:47.090 --> 28:52.810]  Yeah, yeah, if you can drive the car into the garage and unload there do that. Don't show up with seven
[28:53.330 --> 28:55.330]  Sign that says we grow
[28:55.330 --> 28:57.730]  Before I said like guys spinning a sign
[29:05.930 --> 29:09.450]  Fucking dancing and spinning a sign trap house we throw raves on Friday
[29:17.210 --> 29:19.050]  High over here
[29:19.050 --> 29:22.730]  You need electricity. You need water. You need somewhere to get rid of the water. You need cleanliness
[29:23.250 --> 29:28.370]  You need some way to feel secure don't buy a house. It's got old-ass doors old-ass doorknobs
[29:28.890 --> 29:30.410]  Pay attention to your neighborhood
[29:30.410 --> 29:33.070]  It's easier to get away with the grow in the hood
[29:33.130 --> 29:36.210]  But it's also easier to get your grow fucking stolen in the hood
[29:36.210 --> 29:41.790]  So there's a kind of a boundary you have to work with there. You guys are right on that cusp. Yeah in your new house
[29:41.790 --> 29:44.170]  It's kind of it's hood enough, but it's a little hood
[29:45.490 --> 29:48.850]  Well, our neighbors seem pretty cool. I haven't had any issues. They all
[29:48.850 --> 29:54.530]  Are happy well slop was there before so that's it's not regulated. It's not came in and laid down the law
[29:55.050 --> 29:58.930]  Shout out to sloppy for not taking any shit. Yeah, I like that. Can I love that kid?
[29:59.050 --> 30:01.370]  Slop I owe you a hug bro sloppy. Uh, yeah
[30:03.850 --> 30:07.210]  Secret fact he's actually a little bit. There's a little beef going on with you
[30:10.250 --> 30:12.250]  Can't be beef I'm a vegetarian brother
[30:12.250 --> 30:14.250]  I
[30:15.450 --> 30:16.850]  Love you, I'll come give you a hug
[30:16.850 --> 30:21.710]  I'll fucking put on my shoes and drive over there after this even though I should not because it's late
[30:21.710 --> 30:25.830]  But I'm gonna do that. I don't want no beef. I've been in your house yet. You're the man
[30:25.830 --> 30:27.830]  I owe you that you gave me some grateful dead tickets, bro
[30:31.730 --> 30:34.410]  But then just got to keep in mind I work 50 miles
[30:43.130 --> 30:48.290]  I'm not complaining but I haven't had a day off in over 32 days last time I can I was 32 days to my last day
[30:48.290 --> 30:51.970]  Off so sorry sloppy. I love you on day 36 when I get that day off
[30:51.970 --> 30:54.970]  I'm gonna come give you a hug and a kiss on the cheek. I'll play with that big old fucking afro

[31:52.330 --> 31:57.650]  Google golden goat on my podcast because a lot of people have an app on their phone called Siri and if you say hey Siri
[31:57.650 --> 32:02.090]  It activates it makes it start working. So now people's phones are randomly googling golden goat if that worked
[32:02.610 --> 32:06.610]  Haha, and I'm sorry somebody told me to try that let me know if that worked if I fucked up your phone
[32:06.610 --> 32:08.610]  That's really funny to me

[32:32.410 --> 32:35.490]  Also shout out to the mama that worked on my dreadlocks for me

[39:05.890 --> 39:10.970]  I'm not good at building websites. If you throw some money in there, maybe I'll hire a web designer. He'll fix that fucking thing
[39:11.570 --> 39:16.970]  Honestly what that goes to that goes to all the blue host fees to keep the website alive to keep this podcast coming to you

[39:31.930 --> 39:33.570]  That's just how shit works, right?
[39:33.570 --> 39:36.010]  If you throw a 50 in the DJ's tip jar and you write a song on there
[39:36.010 --> 39:39.350]  He will play whatever song you wrote on there next I work the very same way
[39:39.850 --> 39:42.330]  All right, you guys I think that's all I've got for you
[39:42.330 --> 39:46.170]  I want to give a huge shout out to my ninja spins and until next time take a fat dad and give your mom a
[39:46.170 --> 39:48.170]  hug for me

[41:30.370 --> 41:33.770]  What do you know if you learn every day? So be careful?

[42:22.650 --> 42:26.120]  Love
[42:54.120 --> 42:56.120]  Oh

[45:13.710 --> 45:18.690]  This is the episode where I have the lovely miss Sharlow green will drop that in here just a little bit
[45:18.690 --> 45:22.590]  I went to the Denver patient support group in Denver at a place called
[45:22.910 --> 45:27.030]  Castleman's and I was granted a 10-minute interview with the lovely Sharlow green
[45:27.030 --> 45:31.630]  So I'll play that here in just a few minutes before I get to that. I want to read a news article
[45:31.630 --> 45:33.630]  Let me turn on the music
[45:33.710 --> 45:36.350]  this article actually comes from the
[45:36.870 --> 45:38.630]  extract sun times
[45:38.630 --> 45:40.630]  Calm I found this on the internet of course
[45:41.390 --> 45:47.670]  Lately there have been some revelations made in the cannabis industry if you've got a commercial grow or a private grow
[45:47.670 --> 45:50.590]  You may want to hear this if you're using a product called guardian
[45:50.630 --> 45:54.830]  You need to get that stuff out of your garden out of your place. Just get rid of it
[45:54.830 --> 46:00.310]  It is not something you want to be spraying so let's get right into the article here. I'm looking for an author here
[46:00.310 --> 46:03.110]  It says written by Emily gray brochures
[46:03.190 --> 46:06.310]  Alright so this article was posted on January 21st
[46:06.310 --> 46:13.510]  And it goes like this a popular pesticide approved last week by Oregon health officials for use on cannabis plants has now been removed from
[46:13.510 --> 46:19.750]  the list of acceptable marijuana pesticides due to detection of a controversial chemical ingredient as reported by the
[46:20.030 --> 46:27.150]  Oregonian and guys this is an article from Oregon, but soon you will see how this applies to you a marijuana testing lab in Eugene
[46:27.670 --> 46:29.670]  found traces of the chemical
[46:29.870 --> 46:35.950]  Abomectin and supposedly organically grown cannabis and discovered growers had been using a pesticide called guardian mite spray
[46:36.630 --> 46:42.030]  Guardian mite spray includes natural ingredients such as lemon oil and cinnamon among its active
[46:42.430 --> 46:45.110]  Ingredients and is marketed as an all-natural product
[46:46.230 --> 46:53.590]  Abomectin was not listed as an active ingredient on the product label the pesticide has become widely popular because it's more effective than any
[46:53.590 --> 46:59.950]  Harsh chemicals Neil Bernstein owner of roots garden supply told the Oregonian of course. It's more effective
[46:59.950 --> 47:01.950]  They're lying, and they're sharing that they didn't tell you about
[47:02.830 --> 47:04.550]  I'll continue to read
[47:04.550 --> 47:12.510]  Oregon's Department of Agriculture has temporarily removed the product from its list of approved cannabis pesticides until further investigation can be conducted
[47:12.790 --> 47:19.810]  Abomectin is commonly used in fruit and vegetable production, but those produce items are not marketed or sold as organic according to Green Rush Daily
[47:20.210 --> 47:27.430]  Detection of this chemical and allegedly organic marijuana is problematic because people often pay a higher premium for organically grown cannabis
[47:27.950 --> 47:30.250]  especially medical marijuana patients
[47:30.650 --> 47:35.990]  So this company was putting out a pesticide and they were having great success with it
[47:35.990 --> 47:42.050]  It was taking down all the problems, but they were not listing the Abomectin on the label which is not an organic
[47:42.770 --> 47:46.250]  compound or chemical and it was clearly in the product so
[47:46.810 --> 47:51.370]  There may be if this was if this was a rule in Colorado if this product was banned in Colorado
[47:51.370 --> 47:55.050]  And this was applied to a crop in Colorado and a lab found this
[47:55.130 --> 48:00.810]  That crop would be recalled and none of the products made with the trim or the buds of that crop would be allowed to be
[48:00.810 --> 48:05.770]  Sold in a dispensary the product would all have to be destroyed people would lose a lot of money I
[48:07.370 --> 48:11.110]  Hope the people for Guardian are held accountable when that time comes
[48:11.710 --> 48:14.950]  It's a gray area because cannabis is federally illegal
[48:14.950 --> 48:16.430]  I don't know if we can sue for that
[48:16.430 --> 48:22.470]  But if crops have to be thrown away because Guardian was applied and there was a an ingredient not listed on the label
[48:22.470 --> 48:25.230]  I hope the folks from Guardian can be held accountable for that
[48:25.990 --> 48:31.530]  I have posted to Facebook that I'm trying to get in touch with the people from Guardian their website is gone
[48:31.790 --> 48:35.390]  The distributors and vendors that I was aware of for Guardian have disappeared
[48:35.390 --> 48:39.870]  I cannot find them if you work for Guardian or you were a part of Guardian Mightspray
[48:39.870 --> 48:44.390]  And you'd like to talk to me on behalf of Guardian on this show and tell us what's up
[48:44.390 --> 48:49.310]  Why that shit wasn't listed on there or if you have something to say I will give you time on the podcast
[48:49.310 --> 48:53.630]  All you have to do is contact me. It's grow from your heart at a hotmail.com. It's very easy
[48:54.230 --> 48:58.090]  Grow from your heart at hotmail.com. That's an open invitation to come be on the show
[48:58.230 --> 49:02.130]  Let us know what's going on with this. You don't even have to come to me. I can come to you
[49:02.130 --> 49:05.990]  I've got portable podcasting equipment. We can do it over Skype. We can do it over FaceTime
[49:06.030 --> 49:08.030]  We can do it through a simple phone call
[49:08.030 --> 49:10.670]  However, you guys would like to be on the show. This is an open invitation
[49:10.830 --> 49:15.390]  I would like to know why that was not listed on the label of your product
[49:15.390 --> 49:18.450]  I'm sure you knew it was in there because you had to pay for it to put it in the product
[49:18.710 --> 49:20.710]  All right, and if anybody else has
[49:20.910 --> 49:25.370]  Guardian in their garden or in your garden pantry area properly dispose of that
[49:25.370 --> 49:29.710]  I honestly do not know the proper procedure for disposing of a bottle of pesticides
[49:29.710 --> 49:36.510]  But please do some research and get rid of that stuff if you've already applied Guardian to your personal crop you should be okay
[49:37.270 --> 49:39.950]  It's not organic anymore. You can't say it was organic
[49:39.950 --> 49:44.830]  It's not going to kill you and if you've got a commercial crop and you've applied Guardian in Colorado
[49:44.830 --> 49:48.150]  I hope you pass all of the testing when it comes up
[49:48.430 --> 49:52.190]  You guys if you're thinking about making a product for the cannabis community think long-term
[49:52.510 --> 49:54.350]  These guys weren't around very long
[49:54.350 --> 49:58.150]  If they would have made a product that worked and put some thought into it and put some heart into it
[49:58.150 --> 50:01.590]  They'd still be part of the community. We'd still be giving them our money instead
[50:01.590 --> 50:07.150]  They tried to pull some shit on us and now they have to hide their shun from the cannabis community
[50:07.150 --> 50:08.670]  No one's ever gonna trust these people again
[50:08.670 --> 50:09.790]  Whoever they are if you know who they are
[50:09.790 --> 50:11.670]  You're never gonna buy a product from them again
[50:11.670 --> 50:14.550]  If you're a sales rep from that company people are gonna have a hard time trusting you
[50:14.950 --> 50:19.270]  The legal cannabis industry is just getting started and if you're as part of this
[50:19.710 --> 50:25.390]  Evolution of the cannabis industry before it goes nationwide you would have the opportunity to be in a huge business
[50:25.390 --> 50:31.390]  But instead these guys pretty much just got blackballed. So don't be these guys grow from your heart be a good person
[50:31.590 --> 50:37.590]  Alright guys, I am going to time warp us back a few days and we are going to go to Denver, Colorado to Castleman's
[50:37.950 --> 50:42.910]  Where we had the Denver patient support group with our lovely speaker miss Sharla green
[50:43.310 --> 50:46.670]  This was a very great interview. This was the first interview
[50:46.670 --> 50:50.470]  I've ever had where the person I was interviewing had an assistant who was keeping time
[50:50.870 --> 50:56.370]  She told me you have 10 minutes when the interview started she put her hands up and showed me 10 minutes when 9 minutes happened
[50:56.370 --> 50:58.790]  She showed me 9 when 5 minutes came around
[50:58.790 --> 51:00.830]  She showed me the 5 when 3 minutes came up
[51:00.830 --> 51:05.190]  I got the 3 about 1 minute to kind of gave me the look so I knew it's time to wrap up the interview
[51:05.430 --> 51:07.150]  Miss Sharla was on a tight schedule
[51:07.150 --> 51:11.630]  So I do appreciate her for taking a 10 minute chunk out of her night to do an interview with me
[51:11.630 --> 51:14.090]  So you guys here we go. Let's spin back in time
[51:14.090 --> 51:18.250]  We're going to Castleman's in Denver and ladies and gentlemen Rasta Jeff and Sharla green
[51:31.160 --> 51:32.900]  All right, welcome back podcast listeners
[51:32.900 --> 51:37.920]  I'm here at the Denver cannabis patient support group at Castleman's in Denver and I am joined on mic by the lovely
[51:38.200 --> 51:41.960]  Sharla green. Thank you for joining me. Thank you for having me Jeff. This is a great event
[51:41.960 --> 51:45.760]  There are a lot of people here already. It's kind of early and we still already getting people right? We're filling up
[51:45.760 --> 51:51.560]  I think this shows just how excited people are for this opportunity to share their own experiences and learn
[51:51.560 --> 51:54.680]  I mean now that you guys have passed that barrier that
[51:55.120 --> 52:00.720]  Most of the rest of us are fighting for we're all watching to see what you do and the fact that so many people are
[52:00.720 --> 52:06.080]  Taking initiative to educate themselves. It's encouraging education. That's the key here tonight. That's the key
[52:06.080 --> 52:11.040]  I see a lot of vendors here. Everybody has their educational info. It's not like they're here doing a swap meet trying to sell
[52:11.040 --> 52:14.960]  I love the vibe that people have brought it's more of an educational and not give me your money
[52:14.960 --> 52:16.960]  Which is what we've needed in this industry
[52:17.880 --> 52:22.800]  Exactly. It's a service. That's what this is. It's not a trade show. It's not a fair. So I appreciate it
[52:22.800 --> 52:25.720]  Thank you for doing that for us. It seems like every time we have an event like this
[52:25.720 --> 52:27.720]  They're just trying to pull money out of our pockets
[52:31.440 --> 52:35.760]  We've forgotten medical marijuana, we've gone all recreational exactly about the patient
[52:35.760 --> 52:39.640]  So, thank you. I'm a patient myself. So on behalf of all of the Colorado patients, thanks for coming
[52:39.640 --> 52:42.840]  Well, I am thrilled to be co-hosting with dr
[52:42.840 --> 52:49.820]  Michelle Ross who also sits on the board of advisors for MD herb, which is a medical marijuana resource
[52:49.880 --> 52:52.480]  Make sure you guys google that right now. Do they have a website? Yeah
[52:53.000 --> 52:57.220]  MD herb org. There you go guys. Check that out support that it's a good cause
[52:57.840 --> 52:59.200]  so
[52:59.200 --> 53:03.140]  You're kind of well known for your fucking I quit statement on the news
[53:03.140 --> 53:06.340]  Yes, a lot of my listeners might not be familiar with who you are
[53:06.500 --> 53:11.860]  Can you give us maybe a brief history lesson up to today and then we'll talk about the event
[53:11.900 --> 53:15.940]  Sure. I was working as a news anchor in Anchorage, Alaska
[53:15.940 --> 53:22.020]  I became the cannabis reporter and I learned about the true hand of harm surrounding cannabis prohibition
[53:22.020 --> 53:28.380]  I was able to meet the patients that were being affected by our broken medical marijuana system
[53:28.380 --> 53:31.460]  and I knew that I was probably the only person with the
[53:31.820 --> 53:38.400]  Knowledge and resources and access in order to do something in order to help so many people that needed it
[53:38.400 --> 53:42.620]  so I created the Alaska Cannabis Club while still working as a reporter and
[53:42.880 --> 53:47.420]  Decided I would build the club up and step away from my career as a journalist
[53:47.420 --> 53:50.020]  And I decided to do so in a public manner
[53:50.020 --> 53:55.860]  So I had one of the club's youngest patients his name is Solomon and he was battling testicular cancer
[53:56.460 --> 53:58.380]  He decided he
[53:58.380 --> 54:00.380]  he agreed to
[54:00.660 --> 54:04.980]  Not disclose the fact that me his interviewer was also the weed lady
[54:04.980 --> 54:09.100]  he was doing the story about and so that pre-tape segment aired I
[54:09.900 --> 54:15.420]  Let the teleprompter run with something completely different from what I planned on saying and I just spoke from my heart
[54:15.460 --> 54:21.140]  And I told everyone that I own the Alaska Cannabis Club and that I'd be quitting my job to fight for freedom and fairness
[54:21.380 --> 54:27.940]  And as for this job, well, fuck it I quit and so that led to more than a hundred million views
[54:28.620 --> 54:35.820]  Countless headlines we rallied freedom fighters across the state of Alaska across the world really but in Alaska
[54:35.820 --> 54:41.500]  We got as many people registered to vote in that short span of time that we had left and then from there
[54:41.500 --> 54:43.580]  It was all about education education education
[54:43.780 --> 54:49.100]  So we crisscrossed the massive state of Alaska just sharing our own experiences
[54:49.380 --> 54:51.380]  Sharing where we came from
[54:51.580 --> 54:55.420]  and addressing real concerns that our neighbors had and
[54:55.780 --> 55:01.220]  That led to the legalization of marijuana in Alaska on November 4th of 2014
[55:01.300 --> 55:04.560]  Well, thank you for putting your future and your career on the line
[55:04.820 --> 55:08.020]  If that didn't work the way it was supposed to you could have really put yourself in a hole
[55:08.700 --> 55:10.700]  It was gonna work though. It had to
[55:11.940 --> 55:16.180]  Thank you. That was that's an amazing step to make an amazing commitment to make well, thank you
[55:16.340 --> 55:20.700]  It was the right thing to do I became a journalist because I wanted to make a difference and this was an
[55:20.980 --> 55:26.900]  Opportunity to make a real difference. There's no difference to be made in journalism because the networks kind of limit you don't they control
[55:28.780 --> 55:31.420]  With me awesome, so that brings us to
[55:32.260 --> 55:36.500]  Today here at the cannabis patients. What is it the cannabis patients support group?
[55:36.860 --> 55:38.700]  We kind of talked about it a little bit ago
[55:38.700 --> 55:42.820]  Can you give us a bunch of details about this and who's here and what we're gonna do today and what we're gonna hear
[55:42.820 --> 55:44.340]  Right. Well
[55:44.340 --> 55:46.340]  right now
[55:46.860 --> 55:48.980]  Cannabis patients from all walks of life
[55:49.820 --> 55:54.980]  All different ailments are coming together and sharing their own experiences. This is a gathering
[55:54.980 --> 56:02.340]  That's the first of its kind where it isn't just Crohn's patients or patients suffering HIV or dealing with cancer
[56:02.500 --> 56:07.260]  Everyone is coming together so that we can share the knowledge and and we know that
[56:07.620 --> 56:13.420]  We're all growing and learning and that no one is the end-all expert in this
[56:13.940 --> 56:16.740]  Important that we all just continue sharing what we're learning
[56:16.980 --> 56:24.180]  So we get to where we have those direct answers and it isn't everyone still feeling their way through their treatment
[56:24.300 --> 56:28.020]  You know, it is still a little foggy out there the doctors guide you very well
[56:28.020 --> 56:31.840]  You've got bud tenders at dispensaries that are basically in charge of your medicine or caregivers
[56:32.260 --> 56:38.860]  Exactly and when we're talking about medicine and how this would be handled by someone that's gone to school for years and years and can tell
[56:39.500 --> 56:42.460]  Exactly down to a science how it's going to be affecting you
[56:42.620 --> 56:49.020]  That's what we're working toward as as an industry as a medical marijuana community
[56:49.020 --> 56:53.580]  And so this is one of those steps in that direction. I really look forward to the talks. I'm gonna stick around
[56:53.580 --> 56:56.300]  I'm gonna record some of it Richard. Give me permission to some recording
[56:56.300 --> 57:00.540]  So I'm gonna record you guys absolutely add some of that into the show. I've I may do some editing
[57:00.540 --> 57:05.260]  You don't know what I'll have. Yeah, let me put some of that in there. Well, definitely and Richard Haynes is organizing it
[57:05.260 --> 57:10.260]  He's the founder of MD herb. Dr. Michelle Ross is co-hosting the event along with me
[57:10.260 --> 57:14.900]  And we have several patients coming up to share their stories including Richard Haynes
[57:15.300 --> 57:22.020]  Bobby West Ashley Weber and a few more that will really touch hearts and open minds, right?
[57:22.020 --> 57:24.380]  I hope to get some of that onto the show. It comes out well
[57:24.460 --> 57:30.420]  So I follow you on every social media outlet that there is you're quite popular on the social media a little while back
[57:30.420 --> 57:32.820]  The Alaskan Cannabis Club was rated it was
[57:33.500 --> 57:40.100]  Very few minutes after that you went to Facebook and posted a video you seemed calmer in that video than you do right now
[57:42.780 --> 57:43.940]  At least we're here again
[57:43.940 --> 57:47.340]  I mean it just is what it is if that's what's happening now
[57:47.340 --> 57:53.460]  then people need to know it if we voted to stop something from happening and police and
[57:53.620 --> 57:58.340]  The authorities are circumventing the will of the voters then everyone needs to know what's happening now
[57:58.340 --> 58:03.580]  So that people can show up and they did show up because of that how many times has that club been rated?
[58:04.260 --> 58:06.260]  We've been rated twice
[58:07.380 --> 58:11.820]  Comfortable with the routine now, you know, it's not comfortable. I mean, it's a horrible experience
[58:11.820 --> 58:17.860]  No one should have a gun shoved in their face because of cannabis cannabis. I agree. That's absurd. Yeah, we're not hurting anybody
[58:18.740 --> 58:23.100]  Exactly and the fact that they felt the need to send more than a dozen armed
[58:23.260 --> 58:26.420]  Officers and SWAT gear into my home to put guns in all of our faces
[58:26.940 --> 58:28.940]  It's it's sad
[58:29.660 --> 58:31.660]  You look like a pretty badass criminal
[58:36.860 --> 58:41.420]  I was impressed with how calmly you went on Facebook just minutes after and you're like we just got rated
[58:41.420 --> 58:45.960]  I was definitely impressed. So that has to be a little bit of reporter experience, but I'm sure that's just your character
[58:45.960 --> 58:51.300]  So that was awesome. Thank you. Well, thank you. That was amazing. So I've done a lot of interview questions
[58:51.300 --> 58:53.220]  I kind of want to just have a little bit of fun
[58:53.220 --> 58:55.220]  How do you prefer to consume your cannabis?
[58:55.740 --> 59:02.540]  Well, it depends on what I'm going for, okay, if I'm going for a calming effect that I like a CBD spray, okay
[59:08.220 --> 59:14.140]  When I want to just relax and chill then of course I well, yeah, I just like to smoke for the most part
[59:14.140 --> 59:18.780]  Okay, do you dabs? I do dab. Okay, I haven't seen that yet. So I'll have to take a dab with you eventually
[59:18.780 --> 59:24.780]  I've seen you smoke plenty of blunts and flowers. Yeah, it's blunts that are preferable. I know I shouldn't say that. I know
[59:26.940 --> 59:29.420]  But I know I'm going to and I do
[59:34.780 --> 59:38.820]  What's your favorite strain do you have a favorite strain Jack career? All right. Yeah, that was quick
[59:38.820 --> 59:41.720]  You had no hesitation. No, you like the sativa headbust sort of thing
[59:41.720 --> 59:45.940]  I do absolutely and everything that it stands for every time that I light up
[59:46.540 --> 59:52.060]  I'm reminded of that. Yeah, we should always support exactly keep on fighting. There we go every day. Keep fighting never give up
[59:52.460 --> 59:58.860]  So are you gonna be here for the 420 events in Denver during the cannabis Cup? I was here last year. That was my first
[01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:04.540]  US can't but that was my first cannabis Cup period and that was too many people around you for me to get to you to
[01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:06.540]  Say hi
[01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:12.700]  Yeah, yeah, that was it was quite an experience and I would love to do it all again, okay
[01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:15.180]  If you're there we're gonna smoke again
[01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:18.340]  Let's plan on it. I appreciate it
[01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:21.180]  You know, I was gonna make sure that I let you get all of your plugs in and advertising

[01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:28.420]  Okay, well you are today
[01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:31.460]  Her assistant is giving me the it's time to wrap this up. So I'm gonna let you go

[01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:37.620]  I'll be right back to wrap up the show
[01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:41.740]  I
[01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:45.020]  Feel like that went pretty well. That was my 10-minute interview with charlotte green
[01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:48.940]  I hope you guys enjoyed that as much as I did. I want to send a huge. Thank you. Shout out to charlotte
[01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:54.100]  Thanks for the interview and also thank you for treating me like a VIP for the entire evening and also big
[01:01:54.100 --> 01:02:00.380]  Thanks to Richard from herb MD. He gave me permission to record the entire event you guys I recorded the whole thing
[01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:05.100]  Unfortunately, the sound quality was not super good. It was not their fault. It was my fault
[01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:09.740]  I just used my zoom h6 little XY mic. I didn't pick it up real well. There's a lot of room noise
[01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:11.740]  There's a lot of conversation in the back of the room
[01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:14.860]  So I'm not gonna torture you guys by making you listen to that
[01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:18.980]  I do recommend that you go to a Denver patient support group if you ever get the opportunity
[01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:23.240]  If there is a medical marijuana support group in your area
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:29.340]  I highly recommend that you go to that go mingle with the patients go hear the testimony of these people whose lives are being
[01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:32.460]  dramatically improved by using medical cannabis
[01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:38.140]  Several patients took the stage to speak and one patient that really stood out in my mind was a young man
[01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:45.740]  Who said that he had the opportunity to move to Colorado and use medical cannabis to feel better and he feels much better now
[01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:48.140]  He's able to run he's able to play he's able to jump
[01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:49.940]  He's able to be a normal kid with energy
[01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:55.660]  But the only downfall is that now he doesn't care to do that because all of his friends are in his home state where they
[01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:57.660]  Do not allow medical cannabis
[01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:00.140]  So you can go to these meetings you can hear this testimony
[01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:05.180]  If you don't believe in the power of medical cannabis go to one of these meetings here one of these children talk
[01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:07.180]  Here's some of these adults talk
[01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:09.700]  Some of these people develop these conditions
[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:14.020]  At adulthood some of these people were in car accidents and developed conditions
[01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:15.980]  Then some of these people were born with conditions
[01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:20.740]  If you go and listen to what these people say you will be a believer of medical cannabis
[01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:24.820]  Most of the people listening to this show already support cannabis. Anyway preaching to the choir. It feels like right?
[01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:27.180]  Anyway, I want to thank everybody for listening to the show

[01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:09.860]  Sean also known as king cola. How you doing tonight, bro? Good man. Thanks for having me. Oh, man
[01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:14.980]  Thanks for coming. Your eyes are as red as mine feel bro. Yeah, man. It's been a while. I appreciate you having me
[01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:19.380]  How do thanks for coming? You brought some delicious skunk that tastes amazing. Yeah, thanks for the dab, bro
[01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:21.380]  I don't know what that was, but it was ridiculous
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:26.340]  Well now I get to brag that was g funk, uh turned into live resin by our friends at turpex
[01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:28.980]  I actually grew those flowers at green and healthy wellness
[01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:33.620]  That was my first harvest at the at the grow. So thanks for the the huge compliment
[01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:37.540]  You didn't even know what that was and you said it was awesome. Congratulations, man. Thanks a lot, man
[01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:43.140]  So, uh, we brought sean on the show to talk about some integrated pest management, but before we get there
[01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:45.780]  Uh, man, tell the people what you have been up to
[01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:50.020]  It's been a long time since you've been on the show build some credibility and let all these folks know what you're up to
[01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:56.740]  So, uh, I think the last time I was here I was working on a three rivers organics projects
[01:12:58.180 --> 01:13:00.180]  Nice organic grow out here in pueblo
[01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:03.380]  Uh finished it out turned it over to some great guys
[01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:11.620]  So they're from what I understand. They're pumping out some great product right now. So congrats to them. I moved on was doing some
[01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:19.140]  Just some consultation in the industry different crow gigs, uh writing some stuff out helping some extraction companies
[01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:24.980]  And now i'm actually involved in a hemp project. So we're a nutritional hemp company. Uh, we're
[01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:30.260]  Pulled our permits through the cda. We're all legal everything that we grow is
[01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:35.220]  Under 0.3 percent thc so you can smoke my whole farm and not get high
[01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:40.820]  Uh, we're really excited about this project. What is the cbd level of that?
[01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:44.820]  15 percent is what we're averaging right now medicinal value
[01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:49.780]  Exactly. Great. So we're specializing in extraction of that through critical co2
[01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:55.540]  Very good, uh, is that do you need to be a medical patient to receive that since it's no thc?
[01:13:55.620 --> 01:14:00.020]  You don't have to be you can be any age from any state anywhere in the world
[01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:05.540]  Just come here to colorado and get it from me. That's amazing. Yeah. Yeah any amount he invited you come get it you guys
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:07.620]  It'll be available fairly soon
[01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:11.460]  So you said the word nutritional hemp. Is that something you a phrase you coined?
[01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:17.860]  Uh, I I mean I you could say that uh, technically we pulled an industrial hemp license
[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:19.520]  and
[01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:22.800]  Industrial hemp traditionally thought is going to be fuel
[01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:24.720]  fiber
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:26.720]  You know seed crop, okay
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:33.040]  In pueblo, there's actually a ban on male plants me and you had kind of discussed this earlier
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:34.480]  and
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:36.480]  We don't grow male plants. We don't do
[01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:38.640]  traditionally on a
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:42.800]  In a hemp operation they drop a pound and a half a seed per acre
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:49.200]  There'd be a 50 50 male to female ratio that rely on the male plant pollen to drop the thc levels
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:56.080]  In the female to give them that point zero three, whereas we have been selectively breeding
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:57.680]  uh
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:00.800]  These high cbd low thc ratio strains
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:06.240]  Just like people have been breeding high thc low cbd strains. So, uh, it's
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:11.120]  A really similar approach to growing is traditional mmj style
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:16.240]  But with uh, it's industrial technically it's industrial hemp
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:22.240]  Because we don't do the male plants and we're going for the more of the medicinal nutritional factors of it
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:29.920]  That's why we try to coin this term nutritional hemp because it's not fda approved. I do not say there are any medical purposes, right?
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:32.720]  Okay, that's a way to play it safe. We appreciate that
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:34.640]  All right
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:39.120]  Uh, do you want to shout out the name of your farm? Yeah, uh, sand saw cbd. There we go
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:44.560]  Yeah, I can't say that enough sand sauce you be everybody go and check us out on instagram facebook, um
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:50.480]  You go to my instagram king cola. You can find links through various pictures, but uh
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:56.880]  We've been busting out there. We've got about 20 acres. Um that we'll be farming this season
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:01.760]  We've got a 3 000 square foot greenhouse 11 2 000 square foot hoop houses
[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:05.220]  And a 10 000 square foot forever flowering under construction
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.120]  uh
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:09.520]  We're really planning on producing the highest quality
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:15.920]  Organic cbd that's ever been produced. It sounds like you're on the right path for that. Thanks, man
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:21.120]  So you said that you've got to have all females and no males with the number of plants that you're working with
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:24.800]  I know the traditional way is to just flower them out. You cut a clone and flower them
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:27.520]  You're working with a very large number of plants. You told me the number
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:32.160]  I don't know if I have liberty to say those numbers, uh, you know, uh, we can
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:33.920]  so
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:39.040]  You just the guys can do the math at home if they really want to 20 acres on six foot centers
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:41.440]  So you do the math on that?
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:45.040]  But it's a lot of fucking plants. That is a whole shit ton of plants
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:49.760]  There's more plants than I ever imagined being responsible for when you said the number I almost pooped myself a little bit
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:55.840]  Yeah, I every time I think about it, um, you know, I feel that way but every day it seems like more of a reality
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:57.600]  You know, we started out
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:00.560]  With nothing. This was an empty field four months ago
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:06.080]  And now we've got this infrastructure we do and I still have a while and a large group
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:10.160]  We've got a great team out there. I I couldn't stress it enough. Uh,
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:18.000]  Pablo, justin eric chris kelly tony everybody out there's just it's not just me kicking ass
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:22.240]  I mean these guys i'll hurt that. Yeah, i'm gonna it's their job. I'll make them listen
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:26.560]  So what I was getting to is how do you know that all of those plants?
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:29.120]  How do you verify that all of those plants are females out there?
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:32.900]  Uh, we everything's from clone. Okay, so everything
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:36.000]  Yeah is from clone. It's gonna we
[01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:40.880]  You know, just like you would indoor we still we start off c batch
[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:45.440]  Call out the males. So you actually had to grow you had to flower some of them. Yeah
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:50.240]  You know flower them out call the males test out the females
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:54.160]  We knew what this what we were working with what to look for
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:18:00.560]  So it wasn't as difficult as one would think because this is already something that was in existence suzy q
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:08.320]  Which I there's maybe some people are familiar with so it wasn't too hard for us to work it out. We started out with
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:11.040]  a good
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:17.760]  Quite a few females and then slowly built our way up and then now we've got a whole army of other plants. Um
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:23.760]  Just cloning cloning cloning. That's the name of the game. I've got a 10 000 square foot propagation building
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:29.840]  Our greenhouse going up and it will be used for half of it for mothers half of it for clones
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:35.360]  So you said the strain was called suzy q. Yeah, suzy. Okay, so you guys that are kind of just learning
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:43.920]  Just like you'd buy some pot called sour diesel or og kush the hemp has the varietals the same way right now, uh centennial seeds
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:48.320]  Uh their shout out to send I don't know if you're familiar. I'm very familiar
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:53.280]  I went and met with the guy the owner of the company. I think his name's ben ben. Yeah
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:19:00.000]  Okay, so he's a great guy shout out to ben and he's got a lot of wisdom. Yes, and he
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:04.880]  So we're growing his auto and box out there. We've got auto two at green and healthy
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:11.520]  We've got up in the future. Yeah, we've got auto 11 great. Yeah, maybe ours is auto 11 and I just read it as
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:14.000]  It probably is it's roman numeral two
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:19.200]  Okay, maybe it's roman numeral two and i'm reading it as 11. So who knows we'll have to ask him one day
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:23.040]  We just call it auto but uh, yeah, so there's phenos in there that run every which way
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:25.280]  so, uh, we still
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:29.840]  We're running in mass the I won't really release what we're running in particular
[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:34.960]  But those are the strains we're running. We're running in mass what we know for certain is uh,
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:41.200]  Our point or 15 cbd under 0.3. It's actually testing at 0.25
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:43.840]  Uh percent thc right now
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.640]  Uh, the other strains are pretty experimental. We still have a while. Um
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:56.400]  I'll get a good flower. I'll get a good harvest off and then we'll maybe propagate a couple of thousand and put them out into the
[01:19:56.460 --> 01:19:57.520]  field
[01:19:57.520 --> 01:19:58.720]  but uh
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:05.120]  Yeah, so everything since we can't grow for male or we can't have male plants everything has to be taken from a tested
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:07.360]  Uh female, okay
[01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:13.200]  Um, is there a lab test for that that you can use? Uh, actually we uh, there are lab tests
[01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:17.600]  So we've been working with we used to work with labs here in the state
[01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:23.040]  uh, all of a sudden med wanted to be a-holes and come out and say that
[01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:30.720]  Licensed or med certified testing facilities are no longer to test hemp are allowed to test him. Do they have an excuse for that?
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:35.840]  Uh, I believe it's because they're the tracking system isn't implemented with the hemp
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:41.520]  So cda is supposed to start implementing the rd or the radio frequency tags
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:47.280]  So rdif I can't remember the rfids. There you go. Yeah, I have to play with those every day
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:53.680]  Yeah, so, uh, they're supposed to start issuing some of those for us, uh after harvest to get us into these
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:56.800]  testing facilities so
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:03.120]  back in the day, uh last summer basically they is at the end of this harvest season is when they
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:08.480]  Kind of implemented that law. Yeah, I think it was november. They couldn't we couldn't test anymore
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:12.500]  So we haven't really been able to test since then so we built our own facility
[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:19.460]  So right now we're building our own testing facility on the farm, uh, there won't be any need to go any outside sources
[01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:25.700]  You guys are problem solvers, aren't you? You know, it's uh, just yeah cut out the middleman necessity is the mother of invention
[01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:28.580]  I think they said well, you know, uh, the way it works is
[01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:34.100]  Our reg our governing body a regulatory agency is the department of agriculture
[01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:36.760]  So we work with the colorado department of agriculture
[01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:41.300]  Issued us our permit. We're very open with them everything we do
[01:21:41.780 --> 01:21:46.820]  They you know, we file harvest reports planning reports. It's kind of the way the compliance works, but
[01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:49.620]  They test frequently
[01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:55.060]  They but you know, it's sporadic testing. They don't announce when they come and it's usually around harvest
[01:21:55.300 --> 01:22:01.700]  You get a random drug test exactly and the problem is is if they were to come out and test my field and
[01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:04.100]  You know as well as I do
[01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:05.920]  the
[01:22:05.980 --> 01:22:11.840]  Cannabinoid count can fluctuate or change due to anything you get a pest infestation or you get
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:17.600]  Prolonged periods of uv light or you get a drought period whatever happens, but you can have
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.640]  uh exterior factors that can
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:23.360]  You know change the cannabinoid count. Absolutely
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:29.120]  So if this if I have the cda come in and we're at four percent five percent or point four point five
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:31.680]  I have to destroy my crop. Wow
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:38.240]  4.5 is your limit on tfc 0.3 0.3 is my limit. So anything over 0.3 is uh
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:42.560]  Has to be destroyed on the property man. That's terrible. I'd hate to have to see that
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:47.120]  Yeah, so that's the you know, we'll build our own testing facility, you know, it's worth it
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:49.220]  That way we can test these things periodically
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:55.140]  And make sure we we have that consistent product same thing with we'll be doing our own extraction
[01:22:55.700 --> 01:23:02.820]  Now we can do our own in-house lab testing our own in-house homogenized testing so as we're releasing large batch products
[01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:06.820]  You know, everything's going to be the same quality. Everything's going to be the same grade
[01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:09.540]  you know, that's something that
[01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:13.320]  I really i'm so fortunate to be a part of this organization
[01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:17.300]  because they believe the same way I do that we
[01:23:18.020 --> 01:23:24.500]  Will not skip, you know skip things like that when it comes to health and it comes to the purity of the products
[01:23:24.980 --> 01:23:26.980]  We don't fuck around
[01:23:27.140 --> 01:23:31.700]  You guys should see the look on his face. This dude's serious. He's serious. They do not fuck around dude
[01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:32.980]  Big thanks and much respect for that
[01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:35.060]  We've needed people to come to this industry like that
[01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:37.380]  When a lot of the new rules came into play
[01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:41.140]  a lot of money came into play and the guys with a lot of heart like you and I kind of got
[01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:43.940]  Pushed away by the guys with a lot of money and a lot of backing
[01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:46.180]  So it's good to see some heart coming back into this industry
[01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:50.420]  Thank you. That's good. You know, likewise man. It's good to see where you're at, too
[01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:55.780]  Thank you man much respect so, uh, is there a market for a feminized hemp seed, uh
[01:23:57.060 --> 01:24:03.880]  Yes, but uh, the question is is how do you feminize your seed and is colloidal silver registered through the cda?
[01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:08.420]  See if I
[01:24:09.380 --> 01:24:14.980]  Blank stare back ask this before I ask that. Yeah. No, but no the market's getting there
[01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:22.020]  Uh, you know, that's something that we're looking we're very interested and everybody's interested in creating your own seed stock, right?
[01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:26.100]  What farm isn't interested in creating their own seed stock, especially something?
[01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:32.900]  You know the cbd industry is where the mmj industry was 10 years ago
[01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:36.980]  this is there's me and like six other companies out there it's
[01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:43.640]  There's not a lot of us and if you think that six companies a lot you've obviously never driven through denver and seen the dispensaries
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:46.840]  There are six dispensaries on south broadway
[01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:50.120]  in two blocks, all right, so uh
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:53.640]  Man, that's a lot of information in the first 12 minutes of a show
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:58.760]  So I truly appreciate all of that that does that give him credibility you guys can I start asking questions about stuff?
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:01.800]  That we need advice on now. Do you believe him? I hope so, dude
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:07.720]  Uh every time I see you you've gone 12 steps ahead of yourself, and I love it. Uh, congratulations. Keep going, man
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:13.240]  That's freaking awesome. So what we brought you here for uh is to actually talk about integrated pest management
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:14.920]  so, uh
[01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:18.920]  You're running a huge outdoor. You were telling me what you were doing earlier. Do you want to tell me about?
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:23.240]  Uh, you can start with the posting of the instagram picture and how your friends are playing
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:30.120]  I'm gonna just be real with you guys because people run into problems and I ran into some problems
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:33.320]  So we'll just kind of go over what happened to me
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:37.960]  Uh what I used as treatment, um, and then what we do now is weekly
[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:41.560]  Uh preventative measures and you know, we'll kind of start there
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:45.400]  Yeah, and keep in mind you guys this is in a greenhouse and outdoor setting
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:48.840]  And then once he gets through with this I will ask questions about indoor stuff
[01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:53.640]  Okay, so, uh, well, yeah, this is uh, you can run this this is uh,
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:57.720]  Everything that we're talking about can be ran in an indoor environment also
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:00.360]  so we were uh
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:01.880]  You know
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:06.600]  Running in our greenhouses transplanting plants. We actually just moved from an indoor environment
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:14.280]  We were growing in a small warehouse and I then moved everything into our greenhouse and if anybody out there's familiar with greenhouse
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:15.800]  growing
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:23.800]  Uh, it's not easy. It's not it's not an indoor environment. This isn't something that you can just fire up put plants into
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:26.520]  uh, unfortunately
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:30.600]  Investors don't see it that way business owners don't see it that way. They want plants in there
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:36.040]  So we introduce plants as fast as possible. The environment isn't where it needs to be. Um
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:38.040]  the
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:43.240]  There's just a lot of stresses that are going on at the time and that kind of goes to the first step in integrative
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:49.960]  Pest management. This is a real dumb statement, but uh healthy plants are less likely to get sick
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:52.040]  um
[01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:57.640]  That makes complete sense to me. I I yeah and and when he's saying that I really mean that uh,
[01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:04.200]  If your environment's in good condition and your water's in good condition and your light is good condition
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:08.680]  And it's like a report card if you're hitting a's and all of these things
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:16.200]  If one fails you're still going to average out so you need we rely on this system, uh to catch us
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:18.280]  so if you're
[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:24.840]  Half assing everything you're going to run into problems. Yes, so we stepped into this greenhouse
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:31.560]  Not fully ready. Uh, we half assed some things and we ran into some problems and it's life
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:38.760]  I mean i'm not i'm human so we run into problems. So we were uh, we ran in there running into some environmental issues
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:43.800]  We were getting them straightened out and the plants weren't as healthy as they should have been soil was on point
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:51.080]  Uh, you know feeding schedule everything was right where it should be but uh, things were lagging, you know plant growth was slowing
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:57.240]  We were having some issues couldn't really figure out what they were. We were actually posted some uh
[01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:02.120]  I'll let you guys be the judge go on my instagram picture and see if you're smart as these people are
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:08.520]  And see if you can't find the picture that tipped them off to where I was actually contacted by dragonfly earth medicine
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:14.120]  Shout out to josh kelly and sky you guys are my saviors. We're gonna get them on the show
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:20.680]  Even if it's through skype or something. Yeah, they you have to they're just pioneers at what they do. I really hope they're
[01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:23.240]  really
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:27.960]  Helped the you know influence the way that i'm setting my farm up for sure, you know
[01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:32.440]  but uh, so they actually contacted me and noticed that we had some uh,
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:39.720]  You know leaf curling the way that they were curling kind of some of the discoloration problems that we were having. Um
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:47.740]  And through a few other, you know things they actually saw the pictures and said hey man, you have broad mites
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:50.440]  And I said, oh no
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:55.400]  uh, but before I could uh cry they had uh
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:29:02.920]  Taken care of it and sent me over some predatory mites and along with that. They actually sent me a little ipm program
[01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:04.980]  so
[01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:06.980]  immediately, uh
[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:13.400]  You know, we were going to implement these mites so but before I implemented these mites, uh, this is what we actually did
[01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:16.520]  I heat treated the greenhouse
[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:20.440]  I don't know if you've ever heard of this you can do this in your grow room if you have spider mites also
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.120]  uh
[01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:24.120]  Your plants can handle it. Don't be scared
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:32.040]  Ours did and I had to have a lot more money invested in mine than you do your grow room. So yeah, um
[01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:38.140]  But a heat treatment so we actually you can run your grow room at about 120 degrees
[01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:41.560]  For about 45 minutes. Holy shit
[01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:44.360]  Your plants will survive
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:45.400]  uh
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:49.080]  The spider mites won't any bugs won't you're gonna nuke a lot
[01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:56.200]  Any beneficials or anything in there, but you're gonna sterilize your room to a greater extent. I mean, it's not gonna be perfect
[01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:58.760]  and then
[01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:03.880]  When coming back, you know, so run it for 45 minutes coming back off of that for the next 15 minutes
[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:06.440]  No direct sunlight
[01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:10.280]  To hit the leaf no water. So you want to slowly, you know
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.920]  Cool your room back down give it about 15 minutes before you start introducing light
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:16.120]  um
[01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:18.520]  You there's actually a lot of research on that
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:21.880]  So if you're interested if this is something that you're interested on you can just go on google
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:26.040]  Google greenhouse heat treatment and then kind of go those steps
[01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:31.480]  Okay, but uh, so that was first step hit them with the heat burn those motherfuckers. All right
[01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:38.920]  So we hit them with the heat treatment and then after that, uh, dragonfly earth medicine had sent me some
[01:30:39.780 --> 01:30:42.060]  Beneficial insects so we had predatory
[01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:45.260]  They actually sent me two different packs
[01:30:45.820 --> 01:30:48.080]  We got uh, I believe it's a swarsky
[01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:51.420]  And thrip x i'm probably pronouncing it all wrong
[01:30:51.900 --> 01:30:57.340]  But uh, so two different types both of them can protect against the broad might okay
[01:30:57.740 --> 01:31:03.020]  One of them the swarsky I believe it's called protects against the russet
[01:31:03.340 --> 01:31:08.860]  You know the spotted the brown so that one the swarsky is all spider mite and the broad
[01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:11.420]  Thripex is for thrips
[01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:19.340]  And whitefly and then also, uh, these predatory mites also fight some broad mites and they feed off each other
[01:31:20.060 --> 01:31:26.380]  Because they're carnivorous. Okay, so we introduce them takes about three weeks for them to inoculate the plant and
[01:31:27.180 --> 01:31:31.420]  Before I start like you guys run out and you you want to start trying this
[01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:34.860]  This doesn't work in a synthetic system
[01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:40.620]  It only works in an organic system. You cannot use
[01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:44.400]  Uh, you can't you certainly can't use any systemics
[01:31:44.860 --> 01:31:51.600]  So, you know don't go and spray things that kill mites and put beneficial mites on your plants because that's counterproductive
[01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:55.980]  uh, second thing don't use synthetic nutrients because
[01:31:57.340 --> 01:32:01.120]  The thing is is when you use synthetic nutrients, you're bypassing natural processes
[01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:06.300]  you're uh feeding your plant through an ivy there's no need for
[01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:09.420]  Microbiology, there's no need for
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:15.260]  protozoa nematodes and anthropods because you're just feeding it straight to the root zone
[01:32:15.580 --> 01:32:17.920]  So when you bypass these natural processes
[01:32:18.780 --> 01:32:20.780]  what's happening is uh
[01:32:21.180 --> 01:32:25.120]  You're not allowing the plant to build its natural immune like response
[01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:27.180]  so
[01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:33.340]  If you can keep it organic and you can keep this biological system just in check throughout the whole cycle
[01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:38.300]  Then when your plant gets infected you're allowed the plant itself
[01:32:39.180 --> 01:32:44.620]  Can react to it your plant is can fend off spider mites, you know the
[01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:47.740]  If your plant couldn't
[01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:54.060]  Then there would be way more spider mites than there would be marijuana plants, but your plant can naturally fight off spider mites
[01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:59.760]  The problem is is that in a synthetic growing environment, especially indoors your plant has no resistance
[01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:03.520]  Your plant has it's a puss grew up in a plastic bubble. Yeah
[01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:07.040]  so, you know, and that's kind of the same thing is that
[01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:13.280]  You your plant isn't going to build any resistance if you're feeding it space food the whole time
[01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:17.600]  You know, it needs the it needs to digest it. It needs to
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:22.240]  Chew it it needs to you know work that whole process right out itself
[01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:27.200]  Otherwise, it's just going to become weak and decrepit and have no defense
[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:29.840]  Because at that point what is your plant doing? It's
[01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:37.920]  Uh quick vegetative turnovers fast veg times and high yields, that's all you care about and that's all you're focused on
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:42.720]  So you're focused on increasing leaf surface area and increasing bud area
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:48.800]  You're not worried about increasing root zone. You're not worried about increasing, you know, the
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:52.960]  The bricks county you're playing right? You're focusing on the wrong things and
[01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:59.120]  There's a lot more to it than that so when you miss these things your plant, you know can't defend itself so
[01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:03.920]  Just wanted I forgot to mention that is this is for organic systems only
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:08.800]  And if you're not running an organic system, you're gonna have to spray
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:14.160]  Unless you keep it completely clean you're gonna have to keep a very clean environment
[01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:18.320]  But in an outdoor system something like we're running in a greenhouse in an outdoor
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:24.480]  Hybrid environment where you pull in fresh air not through a HEPA filter, you know, we
[01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:31.200]  We have shutter fans. Okay, we pull through that outside. Exactly. It's it was seven degrees this morning, man
[01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:37.440]  But the plants are a lot tougher than we give them credit for if they're outside plants and they've been given even
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:44.580]  You know, honestly even indoors plants are a lot tougher than we give them credit for they've been growing for millions of years by themselves
[01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:51.300]  We should give them a little bit more respect they can they've been fighting for themselves for a long time and I think that a lot
[01:34:51.380 --> 01:34:54.740]  of the problems that modern growers run into
[01:34:55.460 --> 01:34:58.500]  Or because of the modern methods that they use
[01:35:00.180 --> 01:35:06.840]  So it's these you know in my opinion this is you know, just me speaking but it's these synthetic systems and these synthetic
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:14.420]  Environments when I say synthetic environment i'm not meaning grow lights. I mean in synthetic pesticides and you know, yeah, but uh
[01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:17.460]  You know with these synthetic systems
[01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:25.700]  that's what's creating this influx these super hardy spider mites these crazy resistant powdery mildew strains is because
[01:35:27.460 --> 01:35:33.700]  You're creating a feeding your colorado is a hole is creating a feeding ground for pest and disease
[01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:36.820]  you know every single dispensary is
[01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:42.100]  Spraying the same thing, you know, they're spraying neem oil or you know
[01:35:42.980 --> 01:35:50.020]  It's a very short list for a whole lot of plants right and they're not using these biological controls. So
[01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:53.300]  If you don't want to run into problems
[01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:57.460]  Kick it, you know start using organic methods asap
[01:35:58.260 --> 01:35:59.460]  um
[01:35:59.460 --> 01:36:02.660]  And then you know, you can these beneficial insects
[01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:07.640]  They're not something that are hard to get you can go to your local hydro store go to topnotch.com
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:12.920]  Go to copert try to contact dragonfly maybe bug them enough. They'll get them for you
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:15.160]  but uh
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:17.160]  You can get these mites. Um
[01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:19.560]  You don't have to spray
[01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:23.480]  You know, we you know, for example, we put these beneficial mites out
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:27.260]  uh, we top dress with neem and caranja
[01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:29.000]  we
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000]  top dress with diatomaceous earth
[01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:32.440]  Uh
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:40.460]  I foliar spray with natural mystic, uh, which is a dragonfly earth medicine product. So it's just like nettle thistle horsetail
[01:36:42.020 --> 01:36:44.020]  Lavender petula
[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:47.880]  All sorts of shit. You can almost take a bite out of it. It smells wonderful
[01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:52.200]  And yeah, I love to spray the greenhouse with it. But you know, we spray natural mystic. So
[01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:54.440]  uh
[01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:58.040]  natural mystic barley and earthworm cast or like a
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:02.840]  Barley malted tea, you know seed tea seed sprouted tea. Okay
[01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:10.040]  But yeah, so barley natural mystic earthworm castings. That was a preventative. Uh that we were
[01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:12.680]  foliar spraying with um
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:15.400]  natural mystic
[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:17.800]  Earthworm castings
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:20.200]  And bacillus thuringiensis
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:24.520]  That's great for the uh, the fungus gnats. Exactly. Yes. I wiped out some gnats with that
[01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:26.280]  Yeah, so, you know
[01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:28.680]  A lot of these things are just the same thing
[01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:32.520]  Over and over again, right just different forms different applications. Exactly
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:38.200]  So right now on a weekly basis, we give them a weekly app of natural mystic
[01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:43.560]  Uh rocky mount worm castings and then sea crop. Oh, yeah, so, uh, yeah
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:50.280]  So yeah trace so trace minerals natural mystic worm castings weekly basis. You'll be all right
[01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:54.120]  That on top of just maintaining a healthy plant I mean
[01:37:55.400 --> 01:38:02.120]  You know, like I was saying it the key is to just maintain the biological immune response through the entire growth cycle
[01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:06.120]  So no synthetic nutrients no pesticides period
[01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:08.760]  No bypassing natural processes
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:15.240]  Don't put your plant in a bubble. I got that in exclamation points on both sides. Nobody was known you were reading anything
[01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:18.840]  And I just say it's very important and then uh
[01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:23.240]  Let's see, what else we got
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:26.860]  So we got benefit we went over the beneficials
[01:38:27.860 --> 01:38:33.740]  Solicitor gensis, you know, I mean the big thing with uh, integrative pest management
[01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:36.260]  is uh
[01:38:36.260 --> 01:38:38.260]  maintaining a natural system
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:40.600]  is going to be
[01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:45.160]  Looking scouting, you know stay observant you need to main, you know the
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:53.000]  Time when you notice a bug problem, it's too late, right, you know stay on top of these things look out for yellowing leaves
[01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:57.320]  You know, there's a reason sticky traps are yellow bugs are attracted to dying leaves
[01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:04.200]  So keep all the yellow leaves out of your grow room if you are an otill gardener and you are somebody who?
[01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:07.160]  top feeds with your leaves
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:11.480]  Uh know what you're doing top dress with make sure you're top dressing with neem and coragia
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:14.200]  Make sure that you do have beneficial nematodes in there
[01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:20.280]  Maybe you do treat with bacillus through gensis every now and then because otherwise you're going to run into fungus gnats
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:27.640]  So you just need to be a little bit more educated. That's how I got my fungus gnats trying to go no-till
[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:32.520]  Yeah, and I've did it before too. I mean, you know, that's it. It is what it is
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:36.280]  But you know, you learn these things. It's a process and
[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:39.400]  Your plant will
[01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:44.280]  Work itself out, you know, it'll you'll you'll end up with different sprig tails and different
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:48.840]  soil mites and shredders and anthropods and
[01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:55.400]  It'll balance itself out. It's just nature does its thing. They're not welcome
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:57.960]  You know, your plants are healthy
[01:39:58.040 --> 01:40:04.620]  You treat them, you know, you keep doing what you're doing you hit them with your bacillus through gensis hit them with some diatomaceous
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:06.360]  um
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:07.720]  when you're
[01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:14.600]  My guy is at work. I can't fucking get this through their heads man. The diatomaceous doesn't work when it's wet. I love god
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:18.600]  It's got to be abrasive and rough. Yes
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:22.760]  Yes. Yeah, and that also goes for right after you water
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:25.320]  So when the soil's still wet
[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:29.960]  Don't put diatomaceous on it having a hard time
[01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:35.960]  Getting these guys to put diatomaceous out correctly and that goes back to just education is key
[01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:41.560]  Know how to put your pest, you know, or I say pesticide but how to put your products out correctly
[01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:49.260]  You know, like I said the cda came by our farm last week, but nothing on our farm is considered a pesticide or really even a fertilizer
[01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:51.960]  you know, uh our
[01:40:52.500 --> 01:40:56.760]  Diatomaceous earth is bought as an anti-caking agent for animal feed
[01:40:57.160 --> 01:41:02.120]  We use food grade aloe and cocoa our neem and caranja is bought from
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:04.600]  You know
[01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:09.160]  Natural selects or some rocky mount worm company and it's all food grade
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:13.240]  Yeah, so, you know jay only uses food grade material for his worms
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:18.680]  So i'm only getting food grade material for the plants. That's awesome. It's good to know the patients are being taken care of man
[01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:20.920]  It's so awesome. Yeah. Yeah
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:27.320]  So a lot of what you covered you said organic only and then you said if you're doing synthetic nutrients, you're gonna have to spray
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:32.280]  So now here's what we're gonna have to talk about that one the dreaded i'm gonna have to spray
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:35.240]  Let's say I walk in and I see freaking spider mites in my grow room
[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:39.640]  Uh, i've got a light infestation infestation. I've never sprayed anything before
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:43.000]  What is something we can spray that's not going to do too much damage?
[01:41:43.860 --> 01:41:50.040]  Biologically to my planet and also to me when I smoke it and also not make my concentrates taste like shit
[01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:55.320]  Yes, your first go-to would obviously be the neems. Okay, you know, uh
[01:41:55.720 --> 01:42:02.060]  Then the first thing that you want to do is throw down a nice tea of some neem curranja
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:05.880]  Uh earthworm castings just right drench into the root zone
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:10.600]  Into the roots. Okay. Yeah, or you know, if you don't want to make it you can top dress
[01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:13.160]  That's how we ran it at our farm. Okay, just
[01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:18.360]  We and I say neem and curranja. It's because curranja is cheaper than neem
[01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:23.000]  So you can cut it 50 50 and save a good bit of money. There you go. Um
[01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:30.600]  So, yeah, we cut yeah, I cut those in uh neem oil wouldn't spray it after veg obviously, uh
[01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:37.000]  Essential oils you're gonna pay a whole bunch of money, but sns does kind of work. Okay. Um
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:45.720]  Rosemary oil, yeah, they'll kill spider mite eggs on contact and it'll irritate uh, the spider mites push them back a good bit and
[01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:48.120]  inhibit their growth so
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:55.480]  Essential oils things like sns17 i'm not like a huge fan of like ladybug killer red rosenthal zero tolerance
[01:42:55.960 --> 01:43:01.720]  I haven't seen great too good results, but sns I have it's extremely pricey. You can make it yourself
[01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:07.720]  It's rose 90, you know, it's like nine percent rosemary or two percent rosemary oil or something like that. So
[01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:14.200]  You could make it if you feel like being a little experimental. I have cooked some plants before with essential oils
[01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:17.640]  Oh, yeah, so they're extremely volatile, right? You got to be really careful
[01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:18.680]  uh
[01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:21.500]  Outside of that I would go to uh, biologicals
[01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:24.600]  You know would be my next step
[01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:27.900]  So that's when I would step into the predatory mites
[01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:32.040]  Lady bugs lady bugs don't eat spider mites
[01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:39.400]  Lady bugs eat larger insects like aphids things like that. It's actually the ladybug larvae that eat the spider mites
[01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:41.400]  so you need to
[01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:44.680]  Bring them in and then give them enough time to you know
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:50.360]  Lower the lights light some candles play some music and then have them make babies all over your garden
[01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:54.760]  You need a little ladybug orgy. There you go, dude. Just woodstocking in your garden
[01:43:55.320 --> 01:44:00.120]  And uh, their ladybugs limer their larvae will emerge a little alligator larvae and then those will eat
[01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:08.280]  Uh soft-bodied insect, you know smaller soft-bodied insects mites things like that. Okay, so you can you know start implementing that system?
[01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:10.020]  uh
[01:44:10.020 --> 01:44:16.680]  defoliating taking off the infected areas people overlook that so much I can't tell you how many times
[01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:19.560]  i've gone to an infected garden and seen
[01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:27.720]  Stippled plants and these things look just fucks and you know, my first question is why are these leaves still on here?
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:33.480]  So, you know the spider mites are still on your plants man. Yeah, so remove that vegetation unless it's
[01:44:34.500 --> 01:44:37.080]  absolutely needed, you know and
[01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:43.720]  I'm learning a lot from plants running on a larger scale like I am plants can take a lot
[01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:50.840]  And if you need to thin your plan out to two tops from a fucking 12 top five gallon
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:57.720]  It's gonna survive. Yeah, and if if all you're trying to say and that's maybe something that you need to assess too
[01:44:57.800 --> 01:45:01.240]  So when you fight you walk into your garden and you find the spider mite problem
[01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:05.000]  Which you you know, maybe the first thing that you really need to do is think about
[01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:07.560]  What is this plant's intention
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:09.960]  Is it getting ready to be flowered?
[01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:12.200]  Uh, can I just kill it?
[01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:14.840]  Could you is it too much right now for you? You know if
[01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:18.600]  Perfect world I would tell you to throw the plant away. Yeah, you know
[01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:24.440]  Yeah, and maybe you can't maybe you're too far in you've already got too much invested growing cycle
[01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:29.400]  That's when i'd say, you know neem oils and then the essential oils and the predator, you know
[01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:31.400]  The predator oils and things like that
[01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:34.680]  By the time you notice it's usually too late unless
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:41.000]  you can you know veg for another four weeks cut her back take clones off of that and
[01:45:41.700 --> 01:45:43.560]  inoculate the clones and
[01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:47.400]  That's usually what what I try to do if I find something's too out of control if I I do
[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:50.360]  Consulting as well and if I go to someone's grow and I can see that
[01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:54.120]  Their mother plant or their veg plant has gotten too far. I just say take clones, bro
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:57.640]  We can kill you know bugs on clones and get rid of those big-ass plants less
[01:45:57.720 --> 01:46:03.080]  Vegetation like you were saying around to keep all those bugs around so got some clones clean the room start fresh that may be your
[01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:07.080]  Only option sometimes yeah, and uh, you know, and a lot of people don't
[01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:09.720]  They don't understand start fresh
[01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:11.400]  means
[01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:13.160]  Get off your ass
[01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:16.360]  Scrub your room scrub change your filters
[01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:20.200]  You got panda film going by some new roles
[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:27.160]  You you're not you don't just pull your plants out these the spider mites got in there two ways
[01:46:28.040 --> 01:46:33.240]  They got in there because you didn't change your clothes and you walked into an affected garden and brought them in
[01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:38.280]  or somebody, you know brought them in or the second option is
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:44.760]  They brought themselves in and I you know have a agricultural background. I've worked in uh,
[01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:50.840]  Uh cucumber, you know grown cucumbers tomatoes and falcon up in northern or western
[01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:53.560]  Or eastern colorado. I'm all fucked up
[01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:59.480]  But uh, no so like when we would do I was in charge of ipm there and we would do scouting programs so
[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:06.520]  Every morning you would walk out with your magnifying glass and your clipboard with your map of the greenhouse and it would have your rows
[01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:09.800]  Marked out and you would be surprised to see that
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:13.400]  You know, we would find stippling and we would mark them on the map
[01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:17.320]  As we found stippling in these rows once we would go through all these rows
[01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:21.480]  You could follow this map back to a cracked seal in the greenhouse
[01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:26.600]  Wow to where there was a broken because it was a glass greenhouse to a broken pane where weeds had grown through
[01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:33.480]  Uh, same thing in your your grow room. You'll notice that uh, the spider mites in the back corner of your room
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:37.480]  Maybe it's not sealed. You know, you might have a draft back there
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:43.000]  Maybe that's where your window is and you put a piece of plywood over it with panda film because you thought that was going to
[01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:45.080]  Be enough to cover and you didn't weather seal it
[01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:47.240]  um, but that is
[01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:49.960]  That's how spider mites get into your grow room
[01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:52.840]  They it's
[01:47:53.300 --> 01:48:00.440]  Evolutionary thing to want to survive and in colorado when it's four degrees outside and you have a 90, you know
[01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:02.520]  A 75 degree grow room
[01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:06.760]  That's where i'm going. Oh, yeah, like going on fuck your plants
[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:11.320]  I'll take vacation time in there, bro. Yeah, go get warm go snuggle
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:13.720]  That's what i've been doing during this winter is hiding in a grow room
[01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:17.880]  So you nailed something you nailed two things off the list I had written down
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:20.600]  There is your environment will contribute to your bugs heavily
[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:25.880]  And also you bring those bugs in so I get to cross off two things on the list without even asking. That's amazing
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:31.320]  Uh you guys if you're going from grow to grow you're bringing something back with you every time you come and go
[01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:33.640]  Yeah, and if you if you really?
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:36.920]  Want to you can buy a lab coat
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:43.320]  And that's something that I recommend to all of my growers every consultation every we do it at my you know
[01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:48.860]  We'll do it at my work when we're not growing and uh, you know when we get back into an more of an indoor environment
[01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:50.840]  um
[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:53.480]  But yeah get a lab coat. They don't cost anything
[01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:55.480]  You can order them and get one for your home grow
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:49:00.120]  And put it on every time you go in your grow room hang up on the outside right by the door exactly
[01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:05.720]  Right next to your clipboard. Yep. Don't take it anywhere, you know, buy yourself a grow room tam and then you don't wear that
[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:11.480]  Saying that the dreadlocks might carry something in they might get caught in a fan
[01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:14.520]  Oh, man, they get in everything if I don't keep them up
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:19.720]  I have a hat specifically for the grow and it's uh, you could probably collect a quarter gram of hash off of that thing
[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:24.780]  It's so sticky from walking through there. But yeah, you know, but that's the key though is you just that contamination?
[01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:27.000]  it's as simple as
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:34.440]  Not wearing the hoodie that you were hiking in into your grow room and you know, you laugh but to a lot of people it's
[01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:38.600]  They don't think about that stuff. Absolutely. You know a lot of the guys
[01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:40.600]  it
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:45.320]  My work probably go home to their gardens right after my work
[01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:46.840]  uh
[01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:50.120]  Do I worry about them bringing things back? Not really because
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:53.580]  You know, they're an indoor grow bringing it to an outside environment
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:55.080]  now
[01:49:55.080 --> 01:50:01.480]  Am I you know, they should be really fucking worried about bringing something home because if a spider mite comes into my garden
[01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:06.920]  It's not gonna like it very much. It's gonna jump onto your shirt and try to come home with you and see what you got
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:13.320]  Um, but that's you know, everybody's garden so the next time you go over to your friend's house and his garden looks a lot better
[01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:14.520]  than yours
[01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:15.960]  um
[01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:17.960]  Yeah change
[01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:21.480]  Before and after yeah, yeah
[01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:25.880]  Do him a favor too. Don't don't be a dick and go visit your friends grow after
[01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:31.240]  Walking in the woods. Yeah, don't tell me don't come to my grow and be like, oh your plants are great
[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:36.200]  I'm fighting spider mites. Don't come over if you got spider mites stay away from my garden exactly
[01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:41.320]  Yeah, don't bring your powdery mildew to my grow and that's you know, but that's another thing too. Is that the
[01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:45.480]  Powdery mildews, you know now that you said that it's
[01:50:46.020 --> 01:50:47.000]  traded
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:53.080]  you know so frequently back and forth and within the community and that's another one that when
[01:50:54.120 --> 01:50:59.160]  You know when when I say kill and start over I mean scorched earth
[01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:03.880]  I mean burn it down to the ground and build her back up. Yep
[01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:05.960]  You have to sometimes and you know and
[01:51:06.500 --> 01:51:10.860]  Honestly when you your grow room should build be built with that capability
[01:51:11.800 --> 01:51:13.460]  And if it's not
[01:51:13.460 --> 01:51:15.560]  Rebuild your grow room
[01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:22.200]  With either walls that you can clean with bleach or peroxide or whatever cleaning agent or maybe it's paying to film
[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:29.240]  But build it to where you can replace it in a frequent basis, you know use spray foam insulation. Don't you shitty?
[01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:31.480]  you know
[01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:38.040]  Stuff wall ductation exactly don't you know, and if you can't afford, you know these nicer options
[01:51:39.160 --> 01:51:42.120]  Panda film's not expensive if you build the room, right?
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:48.360]  You know, it's really expensive if you you know, I don't know what you're doing and you're running it 15 times around them
[01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:50.120]  But yeah, you know
[01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:52.600]  Build your rooms correctly make sure they're sealed
[01:51:53.240 --> 01:51:54.760]  You know pay attention to what you're doing
[01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:58.360]  Yeah, that's that's one of the main keys to growing is a good room and it you only get
[01:51:58.760 --> 01:52:01.240]  That one shot to build it correct before you put your plants in there
[01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:06.520]  So do it right and like sean said trying to replace that room if you if you're using panda film
[01:52:06.600 --> 01:52:07.640]  That's not going to last forever
[01:52:07.640 --> 01:52:09.640]  You guys take it down every like six months
[01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:12.520]  Like every couple of harvests pull that shit down clean behind it
[01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:16.680]  Get the shop back out clean out all the corners behind there where all that dust built up. Yeah
[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:23.320]  I don't know how many like especially home grows i've been to I don't know why people like to build floors
[01:52:24.120 --> 01:52:29.000]  Um, it's the weirdest thing to me, I don't know how many great rooms i've been in where people have floors built up
[01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:35.500]  Uh, just a couple inches or you know, they'll have panda film rolled out on top of concrete for extra reflective
[01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:41.640]  This is just creating more space for bugs. Yep. Pest mildew and problems like that. So
[01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:49.480]  Less is more in a grow room. Um, if you can hold temp and you you know
[01:52:49.880 --> 01:52:53.800]  Don't need to cover your floor if you have you're growing in your garage
[01:52:54.440 --> 01:52:59.800]  Utilize that concrete floor man, you know, it's nice. It's clean. It can be cleaned easily
[01:52:59.960 --> 01:53:06.300]  Yeah, you know drop you some two by fours and caulk it to the floor go get some great stuff foam insulated
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:12.120]  No bugs are going to crawl through that but just little steps through like that's what's going to prevent
[01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:14.940]  You know for you from having a massive infestation
[01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:18.600]  I like that what you said once you see it, it's probably too late
[01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:23.080]  That's that's something that people are probably not aware of especially if you're in flower
[01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:28.440]  If you're in flower, you just got to start pulling off leaves and write it through. Yes, and I can't tell you. Uh,
[01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:31.720]  How many times i've had to do it, you know, I mean
[01:53:32.680 --> 01:53:38.120]  You know, it's in spider mites can be dealt with they can be like you can get rid of them
[01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:41.640]  It's not the end of the world and you don't have to kill your plants
[01:53:42.360 --> 01:53:44.600]  uh, you know, but like you said if you
[01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:51.000]  If you're getting ready to go into flower and you see stippling don't flower don't be that guy
[01:53:51.640 --> 01:53:58.360]  You know because when you find yourself with that decision of like, oh man, am I gonna have to spray in week four with neem oil?
[01:53:59.080 --> 01:54:03.560]  You're gonna have to spray a week for a neem oil because you put yourself in that position because by week six
[01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:06.360]  You're just gonna have crispy ass leaves and no bugs and you know
[01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:11.800]  But like, you know, but what was worse is or even if you were a week into flower, what would have been worse?
[01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:14.500]  reverting back to veg
[01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:16.840]  or you know holding on to this
[01:54:17.640 --> 01:54:21.400]  Spider mite infestation and having to ride it through and potentially losing
[01:54:22.100 --> 01:54:27.320]  Everything. Yeah, it's another month of power bills versus losing your entire harvest
[01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:33.720]  So, you know, you got to weigh your options on that goes back to really think about your situation. What are these plants for?
[01:54:35.480 --> 01:54:39.960]  True that yeah, are you growing your own personal medicine or you got a crop out there that you're trying to make some bank on
[01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:42.200]  You're trying to buy that new car. Yeah, is it a dispensary?
[01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:45.240]  Is it not your plants? Is it somebody else's money? And you know, that's a
[01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:49.080]  That's a stress that people don't realize exist out there
[01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:52.520]  it's you know, we me and you both we grow personally and stuff, but
[01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:59.480]  We manage other people's gardens. Uh, I mean, they're our gardens, but it's other people's money ultimately
[01:54:59.620 --> 01:55:03.020]  Absolutely. Somebody else's, you know, so what do you do in that situation?
[01:55:03.160 --> 01:55:09.160]  You know, how do you as a grower come to the decision of to call the plant, you know, like what?
[01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:10.760]  It
[01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:16.680]  Yeah, I mean that's the that's the daily decisions that we have to make and if we can do it
[01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:19.960]  You can do it at your home. Oh, you know, I mean
[01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:22.520]  But that's what you really get
[01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:28.840]  People have to start thinking about things a lot differently. I meet a lot of people and it's I got spider mites
[01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:31.480]  What can I spray? I got powdery mildew. What can I spray?
[01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:34.920]  It's not what can you spray? It's what should I have sprayed?
[01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:40.680]  You know if you should be spraying ahead of time stay on top of these foliars compost tea foliar space
[01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:41.880]  um
[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:48.060]  You do compost tea foliar sprays on a regular basis along with beneficial insects mites nematodes
[01:55:48.920 --> 01:55:52.220]  Um, you know top dress with diatomaceous earth neem and caranja
[01:55:53.240 --> 01:56:00.120]  I don't see you having a pest problem, you know, and then for in my greenhouse, uh, you know, like I was saying we
[01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:04.120]  thought that we had a broad mite infestation actually turned out that it was uh,
[01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:12.360]  Another problem was a water issue because our well had collapsed. We had brought water from another well at a different location
[01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:13.560]  um
[01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:15.560]  And did the very foolish thing of not
[01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:19.800]  Fully checking the water's chemistry before we ran it through an ro
[01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:23.400]  Uh ended up putting high levels of salt in the plants
[01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:26.520]  but i'm a firm believer that it was the
[01:56:27.160 --> 01:56:32.300]  Soil the environment and the overall health. It was that natural immune response
[01:56:33.100 --> 01:56:36.620]  That pushed me out of it, you know if if I was in coco
[01:56:37.260 --> 01:56:43.020]  Grown with mills and I put that much salt on my plants. It would have been over the instantly
[01:56:43.180 --> 01:56:45.180]  It'd been like a pepper spray
[01:56:45.180 --> 01:56:51.500]  They've been screaming. Yeah, but uh, we wrote it out and uh, you can go to my instagram, you know
[01:56:51.660 --> 01:56:57.660]  Or go to sansaw cbd instagram and look at this greenhouse filled with just beautiful greenery
[01:56:58.220 --> 01:57:01.100]  I mean it was 3 000 square foot of just
[01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:06.940]  Canopy lush canopy. I was checking out your security cameras earlier and that shit looks good, bro
[01:57:07.020 --> 01:57:09.180]  Thank you, man. Yeah, nice and organized super clean
[01:57:09.180 --> 01:57:13.260]  That's another thing you guys you don't need shit in your grow room that doesn't need to be in your grow room
[01:57:13.340 --> 01:57:16.620]  Don't keep your uh, your broom and your dustpan get those out of there
[01:57:17.020 --> 01:57:19.900]  Uh your gloves take those out of there your hat take that out
[01:57:19.980 --> 01:57:22.140]  None of that extra crap needs to be in the grow room
[01:57:22.460 --> 01:57:26.860]  Maybe the only accessory I see that you can use in there is a little ipod dock so you can jam some music
[01:57:27.420 --> 01:57:33.100]  Anything else get it out speaking of which dewalt makes an amazing grow room radio
[01:57:33.900 --> 01:57:37.500]  It is uh, yeah, you go to lowes and they're like 90 bucks
[01:57:37.580 --> 01:57:41.500]  But they're bluetooth and waterproof and kick proof. There you go
[01:57:41.740 --> 01:57:48.300]  I can't i'm putting my shit across the room all the time, man. Yeah, they yeah, they the little uh,
[01:57:48.860 --> 01:57:53.580]  The little bluetooth speaker at the grow definitely gets infused it falls off the table it gets shit spilled on it
[01:57:53.900 --> 01:57:57.660]  Dewalt that shit man. All right, there we go. You guys big shout out to lowes and dewalt
[01:57:58.300 --> 01:57:59.660]  ipod dock
[01:57:59.660 --> 01:58:04.220]  It's the little things in life, uh, you know, make yourself comfortable in your grow room
[01:58:04.460 --> 01:58:08.140]  Your plants are only gonna be as happy as you are. That's the truth if you're misery, you know
[01:58:08.540 --> 01:58:14.300]  If you go into your grow room and you're looking at it as work and you're and you think of it is
[01:58:14.780 --> 01:58:16.220]  I gotta get in here
[01:58:16.220 --> 01:58:20.540]  I gotta check these plants and I gotta hurry up in water so I can get out of here and I can go and do this
[01:58:21.500 --> 01:58:22.620]  stop
[01:58:22.620 --> 01:58:27.740]  And quit growing. Yes, because that's the wrong approach. Yeah, and that's when you're gonna run into these
[01:58:28.140 --> 01:58:30.060]  You're gonna miss the stippling, you know
[01:58:30.060 --> 01:58:32.060]  Because you're not gonna have stippling
[01:58:32.220 --> 01:58:35.980]  If you're staying on top of it, you're checking your environment on a regular basis
[01:58:36.060 --> 01:58:38.460]  And you know that there's no air leaks or you know
[01:58:39.640 --> 01:58:46.780]  Ventilation issues and if you're staying on top of your maintenance and you're pulling your yellow leaves and you're cleaning up the inside of the plant
[01:58:46.940 --> 01:58:51.740]  So they've got the you know airflow and you don't have to worry about the mildew. I met with the guy today
[01:58:51.980 --> 01:58:53.100]  uh
[01:58:53.100 --> 01:58:57.100]  Was telling me that uh, one of their greenhouses like that powdery mildew
[01:58:58.540 --> 01:59:00.280]  It is
[01:59:00.280 --> 01:59:02.280]  february 3rd
[01:59:02.460 --> 01:59:04.540]  in colorado
[01:59:04.540 --> 01:59:06.540]  It was four degrees
[01:59:06.940 --> 01:59:08.460]  with like
[01:59:08.460 --> 01:59:10.460]  zero percent humidity
[01:59:10.780 --> 01:59:12.860]  And these motherfuckers got powdery mildew
[01:59:14.060 --> 01:59:15.420]  Why?
[01:59:15.420 --> 01:59:20.860]  Because they were growing with synthetics. They didn't clean their plants. It was operator air. Yeah, you know
[01:59:21.420 --> 01:59:25.420]  It's not plant air, you know these and that's something that
[01:59:26.780 --> 01:59:33.500]  Don't blame yourself and don't blame other people because that's really not the way to view a pest problem
[01:59:34.140 --> 01:59:35.900]  um
[01:59:35.900 --> 01:59:41.500]  You should always view it as what can you do to improve it? So if your buddy gives you spider mites
[01:59:42.780 --> 01:59:44.780]  Don't punch him in the face
[01:59:44.860 --> 01:59:46.860]  Because he's dealing with the problems, too
[01:59:47.500 --> 01:59:49.500]  You know, but now
[01:59:50.060 --> 01:59:54.380]  You know if honestly though if you get spider mites from your buddy
[01:59:55.020 --> 02:00:00.460]  Then you're kind of a dumb ass for bringing a plan in without checking it for spider mites and that goes back to you
[02:00:00.460 --> 02:00:02.460]  Just being educated enough
[02:00:02.460 --> 02:00:08.940]  To identify what stippling is to know what spider mite eggs look like to know how to use a magnifying glass, you know
[02:00:11.020 --> 02:00:15.020]  There's so much information like when me and you were learning we had to buy books man
[02:00:15.100 --> 02:00:17.100]  I remember going to barnes and nobles
[02:00:17.660 --> 02:00:19.180]  like
[02:00:19.180 --> 02:00:24.380]  Trying to buy, you know books about growing weed and it was a difficult experience to ask for them
[02:00:24.460 --> 02:00:30.300]  They didn't have them out. It was so weird and nowadays I can go to 50 different webs. I can google
[02:00:31.160 --> 02:00:37.580]  Everything. I mean it's ruined. You can listen to a podcast. You can drive down the street and absorb massive information
[02:00:37.820 --> 02:00:43.900]  That's the thing is just I don't understand. You shouldn't be running into these problems with all of this information available
[02:00:43.980 --> 02:00:46.620]  Absolutely, the resources are out there. Um
[02:00:46.860 --> 02:00:49.820]  Dragonfly earth medicine rocky mountain earthworm company
[02:00:50.380 --> 02:00:53.660]  Those guys come through for me time and time again
[02:00:54.940 --> 02:01:00.940]  Uh jace castings not just as castings but uh, aloe cocoa sea crop og biowire
[02:01:01.820 --> 02:01:09.020]  Earth kelp this everything that we can source through him. Uh neem karanja kelp. He's always hooking it up
[02:01:09.660 --> 02:01:11.660]  Um dragonfly the same way
[02:01:12.780 --> 02:01:14.780]  And then you know the same thing with the other guys
[02:01:15.740 --> 02:01:20.460]  And then you know the same thing follow us on our farm sansol cbd me at king cola
[02:01:20.620 --> 02:01:25.820]  Uh, i'm not afraid to tell you I got spider mites, you know, i'll post it if I get powdery mildew
[02:01:26.380 --> 02:01:27.340]  um
[02:01:27.340 --> 02:01:29.420]  You know, we were dealing with algae blooms on
[02:01:30.220 --> 02:01:33.340]  our root rye we had algae growing on root riot flux
[02:01:33.900 --> 02:01:40.060]  That's because the temperature fluctuation our air temp was staying warm enough, but the cube temp was dropping
[02:01:40.140 --> 02:01:43.660]  Okay, I can they don't make thermometers to check cube temp
[02:01:44.620 --> 02:01:47.020]  But uh, you know, so we were basically
[02:01:47.820 --> 02:01:50.940]  Keeping the cubes too cold. We had uh our
[02:01:51.820 --> 02:01:53.820]  when we clone we'll do like a
[02:01:54.540 --> 02:01:55.980]  aloe cocoa
[02:01:55.980 --> 02:01:58.860]  or i'm, sorry aloe protec and
[02:01:59.420 --> 02:02:04.060]  Full power and then we'll usually follow your spray with like a seed crop or a compost tea
[02:02:04.060 --> 02:02:10.780]  But basically we had some nutrient content and the plants wouldn't take it because roots never developed because it was too cold
[02:02:10.860 --> 02:02:12.860]  The plants didn't die
[02:02:13.100 --> 02:02:17.740]  But uh, you know, there was nutrient content excess sunlight algae bloom, you know, but
[02:02:19.260 --> 02:02:23.260]  Yeah, you just got to live and you learn man like you had a little pond happening exactly
[02:02:23.980 --> 02:02:29.580]  But you put fish in there. So yeah, we now we're running easy cloners. I love an easy cloner. Shout out to the easy cloners
[02:02:29.820 --> 02:02:35.580]  It's it's wonderful, you know, but indoors in micro room it three, you know anywhere that else that we've run it
[02:02:36.060 --> 02:02:38.940]  We do the same cloning method over and over again
[02:02:39.420 --> 02:02:41.580]  Hitting you know 90 percent
[02:02:42.300 --> 02:02:45.360]  You know clone rates bringing them into this greenhouse
[02:02:46.540 --> 02:02:48.540]  Uh, I have I have clones
[02:02:49.260 --> 02:02:50.940]  That aren't dead
[02:02:50.940 --> 02:02:56.060]  Aren't rooted still green and lush. They were taken almost a month ago. Wow
[02:02:56.700 --> 02:03:00.860]  And the reason I haven't thrown them is because i'm really anxious to see what happens
[02:03:02.220 --> 02:03:05.740]  They're either gonna live or die dude. I've got plants i've got
[02:03:06.780 --> 02:03:09.900]  plants like that i've taken clones off of from like
[02:03:10.620 --> 02:03:12.860]  Clones that I took with you know, I took that clone, right?
[02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:15.580]  Yeah, but so
[02:03:15.740 --> 02:03:19.180]  You know roll with the punches, you know information is key
[02:03:19.580 --> 02:03:25.580]  Uh preventative is key or preventative is key and information is a big part of that preventative is know
[02:03:26.060 --> 02:03:32.220]  What you're doing and don't don't go and concede it and cocky like you know what you're doing, but really do your research. Yeah
[02:03:33.340 --> 02:03:35.340]  Spend some time, you know
[02:03:35.340 --> 02:03:39.340]  Looking at what spider mites looks like if you hear that your friend has spider mites
[02:03:39.900 --> 02:03:41.180]  um
[02:03:41.180 --> 02:03:43.180]  Go and for the love of god
[02:03:44.140 --> 02:03:48.400]  Find an old t-shirt or something but volunteer to go over to his house with the microscope
[02:03:49.420 --> 02:03:54.300]  Look and see what the spider mite damage looks like because you're not going to know unless you look
[02:03:55.020 --> 02:03:57.740]  um, but that's what I think is so important is the
[02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:05.340]  Education is that you know what you're looking for. Yeah. Yeah, so if you can become familiar with stippling you can become familiar with
[02:04:05.820 --> 02:04:11.740]  A fungus or you know the difference between a fungus gnat and a flying root aphid if you become familiar with the thrip or a
[02:04:12.780 --> 02:04:17.900]  White fly, you know then people these small time guys aren't familiar with it
[02:04:17.980 --> 02:04:22.700]  You know, we me and you run into it because we're growing hundreds and thousands of these plants
[02:04:23.260 --> 02:04:24.220]  but uh
[02:04:24.220 --> 02:04:31.420]  When you're in your home grow and you run into these problems and you will you're not perfect it happens but you
[02:04:32.380 --> 02:04:34.220]  stop
[02:04:34.220 --> 02:04:36.400]  You know evaluate the you know situation
[02:04:37.100 --> 02:04:42.140]  And don't panic exactly educate yourself, you know, don't run down to the grocery store
[02:04:42.780 --> 02:04:48.640]  And buy a chemical and spray your plant if you've never used a synthetic, you know nutrient
[02:04:49.180 --> 02:04:51.420]  if you haven't you I mean even if you have so if
[02:04:52.860 --> 02:04:56.060]  As long as you haven't sprayed those systemics is really the big thing
[02:04:56.620 --> 02:05:02.620]  Um if you're in veg and you hit it with some advanced newts or something like that. Um
[02:05:03.500 --> 02:05:10.700]  Stop go and hit it with the compost tea top dress with some earthworm castings try to kickstart that biological system
[02:05:12.060 --> 02:05:17.100]  Implement some beneficials start full you're spraying and then just ride it out
[02:05:18.140 --> 02:05:22.540]  Like nature intended and they won't want to hang out. They'll get mad exactly the bugs will leave
[02:05:22.540 --> 02:05:27.340]  They'll jump on your buddies and go ahead to their house. There you go. I'll run out of the bottom of the pots like no
[02:05:28.220 --> 02:05:29.340]  Yeah
[02:05:29.660 --> 02:05:35.340]  So I don't think I would be as experienced of a gardener and in the position I am in if I did not fuck up
[02:05:35.340 --> 02:05:39.980]  A whole bunch that's how I learned the most I think that's how humans learn the most is by making huge mistakes
[02:05:39.980 --> 02:05:43.660]  The more mistakes we make the more we're able to learn so accept your mistakes guys
[02:05:43.740 --> 02:05:47.260]  When you see some bugs in there, it's not your fault. You didn't do that. You didn't cause that
[02:05:47.900 --> 02:05:50.700]  Learn from it. That's what we're trying to say here learn from it admit it
[02:05:51.500 --> 02:05:54.060]  You're gonna have to admit you got something. Yeah, share it with your friends
[02:05:54.060 --> 02:05:57.020]  You guys might all learn something you might be able to come on a podcast and talk about it one day

[02:13:15.300 --> 02:13:19.220]  Most of the folks I just listened have had scissors going constantly their thumbs are going numb
[02:13:19.540 --> 02:13:22.500]  Their eyes are going across their necks are sore. They've been trimming their hearts out
[02:13:23.540 --> 02:13:26.740]  But what that means is that by the time this podcast comes out?
[02:13:26.980 --> 02:13:32.260]  You will be able to go to green and healthy wellness in colorado springs and you will be able to pick up flowers
[02:13:32.580 --> 02:13:38.900]  Grown by rasta jeff and trimmed by my trim crew. So drop in tell them I told you it is a medical marijuana
[02:13:38.980 --> 02:13:43.220]  Only facility the city of colorado springs does not offer any recreational cannabis
[02:13:43.460 --> 02:13:47.700]  So it's at 4 30 west colorado bring your purple card bring your id tell them rasta jeff sent you
[02:13:47.860 --> 02:13:49.540]  We would love to see you when you're there
[02:13:49.540 --> 02:13:54.500]  Make sure you check out some of this cactus cooler live resin or some of this g-funk og live resin
[02:13:54.740 --> 02:13:58.180]  That is some of my favorite shit. I have smoked in a really long
[02:13:58.820 --> 02:14:02.520]  Time. All right. So a big shout out to the crew shout out to el diablo
[02:14:03.140 --> 02:14:07.380]  Let's brag a little bit you guys. Uh, my friends at kind love a long time ago, my friend
[02:14:07.620 --> 02:14:09.620]  Um, I don't even know if I should say his name. My friend
[02:14:10.100 --> 02:14:14.100]  Was the owner of kind love and he received some seeds for me as a gift
[02:14:14.900 --> 02:14:19.060]  And he uh, this was years ago. He sprouted those seeds. He did a little pheno hunting
[02:14:19.780 --> 02:14:25.780]  And eventually one of those phenotypes ended up in the garden at kind love and it was a lemon jeffrey phenotype from seed
[02:14:25.940 --> 02:14:28.900]  And it was recently tested by a lab at 30
[02:14:29.920 --> 02:14:34.260]  Thca so iree genetics is now officially in the 30 club
[02:14:34.580 --> 02:14:39.620]  I did not grow it but is it is a strain that I bred so that counts i'm in the club
[02:14:39.700 --> 02:14:44.900]  I'm, kind of proud of that big shout out to our friends at kind love cultivation and also a big shout out to my buddy
[02:14:44.980 --> 02:14:47.800]  sackmaster flex on instagram for sending me the information
[02:14:49.220 --> 02:14:53.380]  Um, you might remember a couple weeks ago. We talked about a product called guardian mite spray
[02:14:53.780 --> 02:15:00.580]  Uh, there was a product that was very popular and very successful in the uh commercial cannabis production, uh world
[02:15:01.300 --> 02:15:04.020]  This stuff was knocking out any pest problems that may arise
[02:15:04.980 --> 02:15:06.980]  But one day it was discovered
[02:15:07.140 --> 02:15:12.180]  That there was a chemical or a product inside of that bottle that was not listed on the label
[02:15:12.580 --> 02:15:18.200]  And said product has been banned from cultivate from cannabis cultivation in the state of washington
[02:15:18.820 --> 02:15:22.180]  Uh, these people put this product on their gardens thinking it was safe
[02:15:22.260 --> 02:15:26.420]  And then it was found out that their garden is no longer organic because they used guardian
[02:15:27.220 --> 02:15:32.260]  I made it clear on this podcast that the folks from guardian could contact me if they had anything to say
[02:15:32.660 --> 02:15:36.900]  It's been a couple of weeks and I have not heard anything from guardian at this time
[02:15:37.540 --> 02:15:39.220]  If you work for guardian
[02:15:39.220 --> 02:15:45.220]  If you know somebody that works for guardian if you represent guardian if you know something about guardian and you'd like to tell me
[02:15:45.620 --> 02:15:48.120]  Uh, you can contact me as grow from your heart at hotmail.com
[02:15:48.580 --> 02:15:53.140]  I'd love to get you set up on the podcast and you can tell the world what went on with your product
[02:15:53.220 --> 02:15:54.740]  It would be great
[02:15:54.740 --> 02:15:57.380]  You can call me I can go to you. You can come to me
[02:15:57.620 --> 02:16:00.420]  We'll put you on the air and let your uh, let your voice be heard
[02:16:01.300 --> 02:16:04.980]  All right, so you guys I want to get to some uh reviews on itunes
[02:16:05.060 --> 02:16:08.340]  We're going to read some reviews and then after that we will read some emails
[02:16:08.420 --> 02:16:11.620]  I'm, actually going to the itunes store right now to open up
[02:16:12.100 --> 02:16:17.460]  The tab so that I can read you some comments. I'm going to take a dab all this pulls up and we'll be right back
[02:16:18.020 --> 02:16:19.540]  All right, you guys i'm going to read some comments
[02:16:19.540 --> 02:16:24.580]  Then we'll work our way through some emails which will kind of work us into a short grow lesson
[02:16:24.980 --> 02:16:26.980]  Let's get to the first comment
[02:16:27.220 --> 02:16:31.860]  This comment was sent to us by our friend tom's astro blog and it was sent december 10th
[02:16:32.560 --> 02:16:34.580]  2015 and it says here in vermont
[02:16:34.580 --> 02:16:40.260]  We're in the midst of going rec legal through the legislature some of your topics hit on the very issues the committee writing the bill
[02:16:40.340 --> 02:16:43.060]  Are dealing with they are doing their homework. Peace
[02:16:43.620 --> 02:16:49.240]  Tom tom, does that mean that the committee writing the bills are listening to the grow from your heart podcast?
[02:16:49.700 --> 02:16:54.020]  That would be really great to hear. I hope you're contributing to getting those bills written
[02:16:54.500 --> 02:16:58.740]  Uh and make sure that when you write the bills you include somewhere to consume the cannabis
[02:16:58.740 --> 02:17:02.180]  That's what we messed up on in colorado. We've got the seed to sale thing figured out
[02:17:02.500 --> 02:17:07.460]  We've got a nice regulation system set up. We've got a nice uh production system set up the thing
[02:17:07.460 --> 02:17:12.020]  We messed up on here in colorado people can come from out of state and they can buy cannabis
[02:17:12.260 --> 02:17:16.500]  But there's nowhere for them to safely or legally consume that product. So
[02:17:17.300 --> 02:17:19.620]  My recommendation when you're writing those rules
[02:17:20.500 --> 02:17:26.660]  Make it legal to open a social smoke club. We need places like that. We need places like the canna canyon
[02:17:27.060 --> 02:17:30.900]  Uh, shout out to the canna canyon in colorado springs my favorite social smoke club
[02:17:31.460 --> 02:17:32.900]  Um, it's a members only club
[02:17:32.900 --> 02:17:36.980]  You pay a small fee you sign up you prove that you're old enough and you can go in and you can hang out and
[02:17:36.980 --> 02:17:38.980]  You can socialize and take some dabs
[02:17:39.060 --> 02:17:41.700]  Uh, you can smoke out i'm going to do another podcast from there
[02:17:41.700 --> 02:17:46.120]  I've done a show from there before we need places like that for members of this community to congregate
[02:17:46.520 --> 02:17:50.840]  And hang out and teach each other things we have bars where people can go get shit-faced drunk
[02:17:51.240 --> 02:17:54.680]  And get in fights and sorry i'm not going to judge the people to drink alcohol
[02:17:54.760 --> 02:17:58.280]  But you're able to do that. You can go out in public. You can get shit-faced drunk
[02:17:58.840 --> 02:18:03.320]  And it's available on every corner in every city, but there is nowhere for us to safely
[02:18:03.800 --> 02:18:05.960]  And legally consume the cannabis we can purchase
[02:18:05.960 --> 02:18:12.040]  So my advice to you in vermont is to make sure there is somewhere you can smoke the cannabis that people are allowed to buy
[02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:19.640]  Uh, hey tom's astro blog huge. Thanks for the email and also huge. Thanks for the five-star rating you guys every comment
[02:18:19.880 --> 02:18:25.240]  And every rating that the grow from your heart podcast has received as a five-star rating. So I thank you guys for that
[02:18:25.640 --> 02:18:30.440]  I'm gonna move to the next comment. The uh headline says grow from your heart. They gave me a five-star rating
[02:18:30.440 --> 02:18:36.120]  This was left by mr. Jones 617 on january 4th, and it says this man is great
[02:18:36.120 --> 02:18:39.400]  I wish he was my next door neighbor so he could teach me how to grow
[02:18:39.960 --> 02:18:42.360]  Bro, if I was your next door neighbor, I'd teach you a lot more than how to grow
[02:18:42.360 --> 02:18:46.520]  I'd teach you how to take fat dabs. I'd teach you how to carb cap. We'd be hanging out, bro
[02:18:46.520 --> 02:18:50.200]  You'd be on the podcast. We'd be talking about your garden. You'd be hanging out with me and white mike
[02:18:50.760 --> 02:18:51.640]  uh
[02:18:51.640 --> 02:18:54.040]  Find me on facebook find me on instagram find me on twitter
[02:18:54.120 --> 02:18:58.600]  Send me some messages and be my friend and it'll turn out to where we feel like we're neighbors because i'll teach you everything
[02:18:58.600 --> 02:19:03.640]  I know. All right. Thanks for the message or the comment. Mr. Jones and thanks for the five-star rating
[02:19:03.960 --> 02:19:10.780]  I'm gonna move on to the next one. The headline is beck's best grow podcast and it's from rick rat bmx
[02:19:11.400 --> 02:19:14.440]  Bmx, do you ride bmx bikes? That'd be really cool if you did
[02:19:15.080 --> 02:19:17.720]  When I was younger, I used to ride freestyle bikes
[02:19:17.720 --> 02:19:22.600]  I had a gt vertigo for a long time and I had a gt performer. I actually liked the vertigo better
[02:19:23.320 --> 02:19:25.320]  My favorite trick was a 360 tailwhip
[02:19:25.960 --> 02:19:29.800]  Uh, I was a crazy kid. I can't ride bikes too. Well now i'm like six five and old
[02:19:30.200 --> 02:19:34.360]  So I feel like when I fall down it takes me all fucking day to get back up so no more bmx for me
[02:19:34.360 --> 02:19:40.440]  I hope you're out there riding the bmx. Anyway, rick rats rick rat bmx's comment says the gfy h podcast

[02:24:42.540 --> 02:24:45.020]  Click to rate just give it a five star click right there

[02:24:57.580 --> 02:25:02.780]  I'm gonna press pause for a second when I get back. We're going to read some emails which will lead us into
[02:25:03.340 --> 02:25:05.500]  Some grow lessons. Hang tight. We'll take a quick
[02:25:05.500 --> 02:25:07.500]  Is
[02:26:02.770 --> 02:26:07.410]  All right, everybody we are back at least i'm mostly back I just took a huge dab of g-funk og
[02:26:07.810 --> 02:26:10.930]  I took the dab of g-funk og live resident and I dunked it into
[02:26:11.410 --> 02:26:17.090]  Uh some super lemon haze from the clear if you ever get the opportunity to dunk your dab into the clear
[02:26:17.410 --> 02:26:20.310]  I highly recommend you do that big shout out to my friends at turpex
[02:26:20.610 --> 02:26:25.490]  Big huge shout out to my friends at the clear and also shout out to my friend who uh helped me out with the clear
[02:26:25.630 --> 02:26:32.290]  Concentrate that is straight from california. It is super tasty. I am impressed. Uh shout out to the whole crew. Thank you
[02:26:32.850 --> 02:26:35.570]  So let's get down to some emails you guys this email was sent to me
[02:26:35.890 --> 02:26:40.210]  At grow from your heart at hotmail.com. If you've got an email you'd like to send to me, please do it
[02:26:40.210 --> 02:26:42.050]  I may read it on the show
[02:26:42.050 --> 02:26:47.350]  This guy got smart he wants some grow advice on a strain that I bred instead of sending it to the iread genetics
[02:26:47.730 --> 02:26:52.930]  Uh email account which gets so many emails every day this guy snuck in and he got it to the grow from your heart
[02:26:53.250 --> 02:26:57.890]  Uh at hotmail.com email address. This one is from oh, he didn't sign it
[02:26:58.130 --> 02:27:01.570]  I don't know if he wants me to say his name. I will not use your name unless uh,
[02:27:01.890 --> 02:27:05.330]  Unless you tell me to or something. I'm just not gonna read your name. You know who you are, bro
[02:27:05.730 --> 02:27:07.490]  Uh, he says still loving the show man
[02:27:07.490 --> 02:27:11.170]  I have a few harvests under my belt and i'm enjoying this newfound passion immensely
[02:27:11.410 --> 02:27:15.730]  I recently bought a pack of double eyes from nature's green remedies is one and was wondering
[02:27:16.050 --> 02:27:21.490]  If you had any advice for growing it indoors, i'm really looking for a pheno that shows the super silver haze
[02:27:21.810 --> 02:27:23.810]  But i'm open to suggestions
[02:27:24.130 --> 02:27:27.010]  It goes to list a little bit of his nutrients and his light
[02:27:27.810 --> 02:27:31.730]  He mentioned some other strains that he's growing asks if I have experience with those
[02:27:32.130 --> 02:27:36.610]  No, I have not grown those particular strains. He goes on and says keep up the great work
[02:27:36.610 --> 02:27:42.210]  You've definitely helped me get better cleaner medicine to a few people in my area. Take care, bro
[02:27:42.210 --> 02:27:45.090]  I'm proud of you for getting cleaner and better medicine. Thanks for listening
[02:27:45.650 --> 02:27:48.850]  Uh as for nature's green remedies, they are now known as the dank team
[02:27:48.930 --> 02:27:54.530]  So if you're looking for high quality feminized or regular cannabis seeds check out the dank team.com
[02:27:54.610 --> 02:27:59.170]  I'm, not sure what they've got going on. Sometimes they've got iree genetics products in stock
[02:27:59.650 --> 02:28:06.370]  Uh, your main question was uh, you bought a pack of dubwise and you're wondering if i've got any advice for growing that indoors
[02:28:07.010 --> 02:28:11.730]  My first piece of advice will be that plant will get tall that shit likes to get tall
[02:28:12.130 --> 02:28:15.250]  Super quickly on you when you put it into flower. It's going to double in size
[02:28:15.330 --> 02:28:18.130]  So if you've got a three foot tall plant when you put it into flower
[02:28:18.210 --> 02:28:23.730]  You're going to have a six foot tall plant be prepared for that. If you've got short ceilings, maybe flower early
[02:28:24.530 --> 02:28:25.790]  something I can
[02:28:25.790 --> 02:28:31.730]  recommend strongly that plant loves to be scrogged if you put out a trellis if you put out the screen and you let that plant
[02:28:31.730 --> 02:28:35.490]  Grow into the screen and then it's if it tries to get taller than the screen you grab a branch
[02:28:35.730 --> 02:28:37.730]  And push it back under the screen bend it down
[02:28:37.730 --> 02:28:39.970]  However, you got to do it weave it all the way through the screen
[02:28:40.370 --> 02:28:44.930]  If you can make that plant six feet wide and only two feet tall the plant will love it
[02:28:45.170 --> 02:28:48.210]  It will produce a bunch of arms. It will produce a bunch of little buds for you
[02:28:48.210 --> 02:28:52.050]  Not little buds. It'll produce a bunch of like pine cone sized buds at every bud site for you
[02:28:52.290 --> 02:28:55.890]  So instead of one big glory cola, you'll have a whole bunch of medium size
[02:28:56.450 --> 02:28:58.450]  medium size pine cone buds
[02:28:58.690 --> 02:29:01.650]  So scrog it out stretch it out give it some space don't let it get too tall
[02:29:02.130 --> 02:29:07.650]  Also that fucker likes to get nitrogen deficient if you see it yellowing up early in flower step up your nitrogen
[02:29:07.730 --> 02:29:09.990]  Don't be afraid it can take a lot of nitrogen
[02:29:10.770 --> 02:29:15.170]  Both of that plant's parents are heavy feeders and it will definitely eat up the nitrogen on you
[02:29:15.410 --> 02:29:19.650]  So keep it short scrog it flower early because it's going to get tall on you
[02:29:20.130 --> 02:29:24.610]  Uh, give it plenty of nitrogen in the early starts of flower and let it go long enough
[02:29:24.690 --> 02:29:26.450]  One thing people don't like to do with dubwise
[02:29:26.450 --> 02:29:30.130]  They don't like to let it go long enough that plant could probably go depending on the phenol
[02:29:30.130 --> 02:29:35.170]  You've got they could go up to 77 days if you need to take it at 70 go for it, but see what happens
[02:29:35.570 --> 02:29:38.450]  Um, there's not a big problem with letting plants go too long
[02:29:39.250 --> 02:29:41.410]  You can really see what they do. All right
[02:29:42.210 --> 02:29:44.950]  Sorry, i'm choking off the dab. I took just a minute ago, but i'm recovering
[02:29:45.810 --> 02:29:47.810]  Dude, thank you for the email. I truly appreciate it
[02:29:47.970 --> 02:29:49.970]  I don't know if you want me to say your name on the air or not
[02:29:49.970 --> 02:29:54.450]  So i'm not going to do that. You know who you are big shout out big fist bump. I hope I answered your questions
[02:29:54.930 --> 02:29:58.370]  Uh, check out the dank team.com when you need more beans
[02:29:59.010 --> 02:29:59.330]  All right
[02:29:59.330 --> 02:30:02.290]  I'm going to move on to the next email you guys this one came from our friend mike
[02:30:02.370 --> 02:30:06.210]  Oh, mike o has emailed us before this time. He's not as happy as he was in the past
[02:30:06.690 --> 02:30:10.530]  Here's what mike o has to say love the podcast, but it has sucked lately
[02:30:10.610 --> 02:30:12.370]  I know you have a new gig that keeps you busy
[02:30:12.370 --> 02:30:15.170]  But if you aren't going to keep up the quality then maybe take a break
[02:30:15.490 --> 02:30:20.610]  The last few have been lackluster to say the least what happened to all the old regulars white
[02:30:20.610 --> 02:30:25.330]  Mike is not around anymore. What's up with that? Hope you get back to the grow talk soon
[02:30:26.530 --> 02:30:28.370]  Uh, I apologize if you don't like the show bro
[02:30:28.370 --> 02:30:32.130]  There was one week when I had a guest lined up and at the last minute I called my guest
[02:30:32.210 --> 02:30:34.690]  I was like you want to come do a show and he's like bro. I had to go to the hospital
[02:30:34.770 --> 02:30:38.370]  He had some medical issues. I had the recording gear ready. I was hoping he'd be on the show
[02:30:38.610 --> 02:30:42.290]  I cannot blame it on the dude. He fucking had a medical issue. He had to take off
[02:30:42.530 --> 02:30:46.610]  I had my friends carlos and alan come over. I know that wasn't the most amazing podcast
[02:30:46.610 --> 02:30:49.250]  But we put out a show for you. We did the best we could with what we had
[02:30:49.730 --> 02:30:52.050]  The next show was bobo blaster co that show was fun
[02:30:52.450 --> 02:30:56.210]  I think those are the two shows when he said they were lackluster because there wasn't much grow info
[02:30:56.210 --> 02:30:58.210]  It was just me and my bros hanging out
[02:30:58.690 --> 02:31:02.770]  It's cannabis news education and conversation. Those episodes were conversation, bro
[02:31:02.770 --> 02:31:07.410]  Sometimes that shit's gonna happen. Uh, not every episode is going to be an encyclopedia of cannabis knowledge
[02:31:07.490 --> 02:31:12.530]  I do hope you keep listening. Uh, we've gotten good emails from you before so I hope you stick around
[02:31:13.090 --> 02:31:18.130]  Uh, you cannot say that the episode with sean last time was not loaded with information
[02:31:18.290 --> 02:31:20.290]  So there was your cannabis education
[02:31:20.450 --> 02:31:25.250]  Uh, the other two episodes were conversation and you got plenty of news that people are bored with the news
[02:31:25.250 --> 02:31:29.250]  I know that but sometimes it's my duty to bring you the news. So I bring it all to you
[02:31:29.570 --> 02:31:33.650]  Maybe not all of it is your flavor, but I still hope uh, you listen what happened to mike
[02:31:33.730 --> 02:31:36.530]  Mike's got a new child, bro. Mike's got a job and a new baby
[02:31:36.930 --> 02:31:42.450]  Uh, mike doesn't find it a priority to be on the podcast. I'm sure that that child and his family are number one
[02:31:42.930 --> 02:31:47.490]  Uh, then the job and then his life somewhere and then sort of like probably 25th or 30th on the list
[02:31:47.490 --> 02:31:51.250]  I hope is my podcast, uh, mike's got a life. He's a busy man
[02:31:51.810 --> 02:31:56.210]  Uh, jesse's fucking busy working all those people. We all have jobs. We've all kind of uh,
[02:31:56.770 --> 02:32:00.450]  We all grew we all got on a podcast and made ourselves known and we've expanded
[02:32:00.450 --> 02:32:05.170]  We're all doing our own projects now and we're tied up. And yes, I do have a gig that keeps me busy
[02:32:05.890 --> 02:32:10.370]  Uh, but I use a lot of that content and that stuff that I learned at that gig for this podcast
[02:32:10.450 --> 02:32:12.450]  so it is contributing it's keeping me busy, but
[02:32:13.250 --> 02:32:18.050]  It's making the show have content as well mike, I apologize you don't like the show as well sometimes
[02:32:18.690 --> 02:32:20.690]  Uh, I hope I didn't lose you as a listener
[02:32:21.010 --> 02:32:22.610]  um
[02:32:22.610 --> 02:32:26.610]  Yeah, thanks for the letter. Sorry man. Shit. I hope you like it. All right, you guys so we are
[02:32:26.610 --> 02:32:29.890]  We're always gonna have one negative email. I'm not gonna hide it from you or nothing. That shit's gonna happen
[02:32:30.610 --> 02:32:32.610]  Uh, let's keep moving
[02:32:33.490 --> 02:32:38.530]  This podcast comes with a totally different tone. This one says you're awesome help and advice
[02:32:39.090 --> 02:32:44.690]  Uh, it says hey jeff firstly I want to say thank you. Thanks for such an awesome podcast, you know your shiz
[02:32:45.890 --> 02:32:49.330]  And then he also says if you're taking your time to read this then I greatly appreciate it
[02:32:49.650 --> 02:32:52.530]  If not, then no sweat. I know you're a busy guy. I can relate
[02:32:52.770 --> 02:32:56.930]  He said I recently found your podcast and have been listening at work for about two weeks now, bro
[02:32:57.010 --> 02:32:58.610]  Do they know you're listening at work?
[02:32:58.610 --> 02:33:03.810]  He also says uh going through a lot of your shows and listening to them by title rather than in order
[02:33:04.450 --> 02:33:07.970]  I've took so much of your advice on board and made so many notes
[02:33:08.210 --> 02:33:11.250]  But it just doesn't seem to cut it when compared to direct advice
[02:33:11.650 --> 02:33:16.690]  I found myself researching dozens of new things which leads me to more unanswered questions
[02:33:17.810 --> 02:33:21.270]  Uh that statement right there is partly what inspired me to do a podcast
[02:33:21.890 --> 02:33:27.890]  I could probably go to any forum on the internet that talks about growing cannabis and I could throw up a random question
[02:33:28.210 --> 02:33:32.290]  Just anything about growing weed and i'd probably get seven to ten replies pretty quickly
[02:33:32.690 --> 02:33:39.410]  And I would say that 50 uh 50 percent of those replies would be bullshit that would actually cause me more harm than good
[02:33:39.650 --> 02:33:41.650]  So that is the problem with the internet when you go
[02:33:42.290 --> 02:33:47.970]  Researching cannabis on the internet you do end up in a wormhole or what we like to call the k-hole of just researching more and
[02:33:48.050 --> 02:33:51.890]  More and more and more and then you have to go debunk the first thing that you read and
[02:33:52.290 --> 02:33:56.210]  Go research everything else to make sure it all matches up. The internet can be a real bitch like that
[02:33:56.210 --> 02:33:59.570]  So that's why I came on with the podcast. I wanted to make some of those things clear
[02:33:59.570 --> 02:34:04.290]  I feel like I know what i'm talking about and I try not to give you any advice. It would destroy your garden
[02:34:05.250 --> 02:34:10.370]  So, uh, I totally understand what you mean about having to do more research. Let me keep reading with your email
[02:34:10.370 --> 02:34:11.650]  I'm kind of ranty today
[02:34:11.650 --> 02:34:15.570]  Uh, it goes on to say many moons ago. I grew for a few years and had some awesome results
[02:34:15.570 --> 02:34:19.330]  But now i'm doing it totally different and I don't really remember the important info
[02:34:19.330 --> 02:34:20.770]  so if you're not too busy
[02:34:20.770 --> 02:34:26.130]  I'd like to tell you my small setup and info and ask you a few questions and see if you can shine a light
[02:34:26.210 --> 02:34:32.390]  On things for me. I wish I had your skill set and know-how. So any advice tips and recommendations whatsoever
[02:34:33.010 --> 02:34:37.010]  Will be implemented and greatly appreciated. I understand if you're too busy, dude, let me know
[02:34:37.570 --> 02:34:42.290]  Thanks. Love the podcast. It's awesome kind regards and i'm not going to say your name because I don't know if you want me to
[02:34:43.010 --> 02:34:44.450]  uh, my uh
[02:34:44.450 --> 02:34:46.290]  my advice would be
[02:34:46.290 --> 02:34:51.250]  Just what you're doing when you do go to the internet and you read some stuff be careful of what you're reading
[02:34:51.810 --> 02:34:55.250]  I've said this before on the podcast if you read something and you think you're going to do it
[02:34:55.810 --> 02:34:57.650]  Go smoke a joint and think about it
[02:34:57.650 --> 02:35:01.970]  Think about what you're going to do to your crop think about what that's going to do in five to seven days
[02:35:02.210 --> 02:35:05.650]  Think about what that's going to do to your plant when you try to flower it
[02:35:05.890 --> 02:35:09.810]  Think about the whole cycle of your plant when you do whatever you're going to do if you're going to cut something
[02:35:09.890 --> 02:35:13.330]  You can't un-cut it if you're going to feed it something you can't unfeed it
[02:35:13.970 --> 02:35:15.970]  So just go smoke a joint
[02:35:16.210 --> 02:35:19.250]  Think seriously about what you're going to do to your plant. Have a reason for it
[02:35:19.330 --> 02:35:24.370]  Don't just do something to your plant to do something have a thought-out reason have a method to your madness
[02:35:24.370 --> 02:35:27.070]  So that's probably my first piece of advice.
[02:35:27.070 --> 02:35:29.650]  Research it and have a reason why you're going to do it.
[02:35:29.650 --> 02:35:34.750]  Think about it, smoke a joint, think about it again, take a dab, think about it again,
[02:35:34.750 --> 02:35:35.750]  and then try it.
[02:35:35.750 --> 02:35:39.670]  And if you're going to try something new, maybe don't try it on every plant in the crop.
[02:35:39.670 --> 02:35:42.830]  If you're going to feed a new nutrient, if you're going to do a new pruning technique,
[02:35:42.830 --> 02:35:45.150]  maybe just pick one plant, label that one.
[02:35:45.150 --> 02:35:48.030]  I like to just put a piece of white duct tape with a star on it.
[02:35:48.030 --> 02:35:50.790]  And then in my notes in my notebook, I write the plant with the star is the one that I
[02:35:50.790 --> 02:35:53.910]  pee in every morning, and then you see how it reacts to that.
[02:35:53.910 --> 02:35:57.870]  And you wait a couple weeks or depending on what you do, sometimes you'll know by tomorrow
[02:35:57.870 --> 02:36:01.670]  morning, you'll be like, oh, don't ever do that to that plant again, it got really mad.
[02:36:01.670 --> 02:36:04.790]  But now you learned something, you've got one fucked up plant, but you still got the
[02:36:04.790 --> 02:36:08.390]  rest of the crop to recover, that stuff will still be there, you can harvest that you can
[02:36:08.390 --> 02:36:09.390]  keep going.
[02:36:09.390 --> 02:36:10.830]  So experiment with one plant at a time.
[02:36:10.830 --> 02:36:13.110]  That's some advice I could give you.
[02:36:13.110 --> 02:36:18.110]  If you would like to email me the rest of your setup, send me the size of your setup,
[02:36:18.110 --> 02:36:22.130]  what kind of light you're using, what kind of nutrients you're using, send me that stuff.
[02:36:22.130 --> 02:36:23.710]  And I will try to get you some advice.
[02:36:23.710 --> 02:36:25.830]  I will give the advice on this podcast.
[02:36:25.830 --> 02:36:28.990]  What you're doing is you're creating content with me and for me.
[02:36:28.990 --> 02:36:32.910]  I'm going to help you out, you're going to help me out, and it's going to help out more
[02:36:32.910 --> 02:36:33.910]  listeners.
[02:36:33.910 --> 02:36:34.910]  So send me your info.
[02:36:34.910 --> 02:36:38.630]  Let me know what kind of soil or soilless mix or hydro kit you're using.
[02:36:38.630 --> 02:36:40.670]  Give me some info to work with.
[02:36:40.670 --> 02:36:44.650]  And then we will get a podcast out aimed at you and other folks in your situation.
[02:36:44.650 --> 02:36:48.130]  And hopefully we can get people growing better cannabis.
[02:36:48.130 --> 02:36:50.130]  I hope there was some useful advice in there.
[02:36:50.130 --> 02:36:51.370]  I'm in a rambly mood today.
[02:36:51.370 --> 02:36:52.850]  All right, I've got another email.
[02:36:52.850 --> 02:36:55.930]  This is probably the last email for this episode.
[02:36:55.930 --> 02:36:58.250]  We're getting up on 27 minutes right now.
[02:36:58.250 --> 02:37:01.170]  So this email goes like this.
[02:37:01.170 --> 02:37:03.690]  Yo, Jeff, it's your boy from South Florida again.
[02:37:03.690 --> 02:37:07.850]  I emailed you only one time before, but like I said in that email, I never met you, but
[02:37:07.850 --> 02:37:10.810]  I feel I know you, big dog.
[02:37:10.810 --> 02:37:12.170]  Here's a handle to remember me by.
[02:37:12.170 --> 02:37:13.450]  And then he says his name.
[02:37:13.450 --> 02:37:17.770]  He says, anyway, man, I was wondering if you can explain a few things to me.
[02:37:17.770 --> 02:37:20.450]  You can email me back or you can put it on a future show if you like.
[02:37:20.450 --> 02:37:21.450]  Well, here it is, bro.
[02:37:21.450 --> 02:37:25.090]  He says, I wanted to know about salves and rubs.
[02:37:25.090 --> 02:37:27.450]  I get horrible knee, leg, and right hand pain.
[02:37:27.450 --> 02:37:29.650]  I swear I'm going to have arthritis when I get older.
[02:37:29.650 --> 02:37:31.210]  I'm only 31 now.
[02:37:31.210 --> 02:37:32.770]  Anyway, do they work?
[02:37:32.770 --> 02:37:33.770]  What's the best kind?
[02:37:33.770 --> 02:37:37.750]  Do you have any firsthand experience with it or do any of your boys?
[02:37:37.750 --> 02:37:38.750]  So that's the first question.
[02:37:38.750 --> 02:37:40.570]  He asked a couple of questions.
[02:37:40.570 --> 02:37:43.370]  The first question is about salves.
[02:37:43.410 --> 02:37:45.690]  He wants to know if they work.
[02:37:45.690 --> 02:37:48.250]  Honestly, I was skeptical of the topicals.
[02:37:48.250 --> 02:37:53.130]  I didn't think they would do anything, but our good friends at Apothecana gave me a bottle
[02:37:53.130 --> 02:37:55.170]  of their Apothecana pain cream.
[02:37:55.170 --> 02:37:57.890]  It was the red labeled pain-free cream.
[02:37:57.890 --> 02:38:02.530]  And I actually gave somebody a back massage with it because they had a shoulder problem.
[02:38:02.530 --> 02:38:07.250]  And as I was rubbing their shoulder, I noticed that my hands and my fingers were starting
[02:38:07.250 --> 02:38:08.250]  to feel fluffy.
[02:38:08.250 --> 02:38:11.690]  Like it felt like I had big padded gloves on.
[02:38:11.690 --> 02:38:13.810]  My fingers and my hands were high.
[02:38:13.810 --> 02:38:17.130]  It was certainly working on my fingers.
[02:38:17.130 --> 02:38:21.850]  The person that I was massaging swore that it made her shoulder better.
[02:38:21.850 --> 02:38:25.210]  My mom works in a cold environment.
[02:38:25.210 --> 02:38:27.690]  She works in a freezer area.
[02:38:27.690 --> 02:38:32.410]  And I got her some pain cream, some Mary Jane's pain cream, and she rubs it on.
[02:38:32.410 --> 02:38:35.770]  She uses it on her hands and she puts it on her elbows and knees.
[02:38:35.770 --> 02:38:38.410]  And she says it helps her a lot with the pain from that.
[02:38:38.410 --> 02:38:41.170]  So yes, that stuff does work.
[02:38:41.170 --> 02:38:46.410]  As for brands, I would probably recommend Apothecana over anything else.
[02:38:46.410 --> 02:38:49.930]  Second in line would be Mary Jane's pain cream.
[02:38:49.930 --> 02:38:51.050]  So I'm going to continue with the email.
[02:38:51.050 --> 02:38:53.690]  He asked me another question that I am not even going to read that part.
[02:38:53.690 --> 02:38:55.930]  The answer is hell no.
[02:38:55.930 --> 02:38:57.690]  You know what you asked me.
[02:38:57.690 --> 02:39:02.410]  Then he says, oh, also dude, you mentioned that you're going to have arthritis.
[02:39:02.410 --> 02:39:04.170]  A lot of that could be treated by your diet.
[02:39:04.170 --> 02:39:07.050]  I know you probably don't want to hear it, but there are a lot of things that you're
[02:39:07.050 --> 02:39:09.290]  eating that are causing inflammation.
[02:39:09.410 --> 02:39:14.810]  I would read about what foods that cause inflammation, like gluten, sodas, things like that will
[02:39:14.810 --> 02:39:17.290]  cause your inflammation, which will make your hands hurt more.
[02:39:17.290 --> 02:39:21.170]  Maybe if you cut some of that stuff out, added a little bit of water to your diet, that'll
[02:39:21.170 --> 02:39:22.610]  probably help.
[02:39:22.610 --> 02:39:26.810]  So I'm going to continue and look for more questions in your email because it's long.
[02:39:26.810 --> 02:39:28.010]  There's a lot of stuff going on.
[02:39:28.010 --> 02:39:34.810]  He says, also, I wanted to know what are the best strains for pain, inflammation, and anxiety?
[02:39:34.810 --> 02:39:40.330]  Good strains for pain and inflammation or anything with a lot of CBD in it.
[02:39:40.330 --> 02:39:46.410]  Strains like Harlequin, strains like Charlotte's Web, strains like Kush Tonic or Canna Tonic
[02:39:46.410 --> 02:39:52.370]  or anything high in CBD will be very good for your inflammation and your pain, and it
[02:39:52.370 --> 02:39:55.130]  will also help with your anxiety.
[02:39:55.130 --> 02:40:00.090]  One of my favorite strains to smoke to calm, it's a sativa dominant strain, but it makes
[02:40:00.090 --> 02:40:03.050]  my anxiety if I'm nervous about going somewhere.
[02:40:03.330 --> 02:40:05.890]  I just got to go places I don't want to go and I don't want to talk to people.
[02:40:05.890 --> 02:40:07.210]  I'm just in that mood.
[02:40:07.210 --> 02:40:12.810]  If I smoke some tangy or some jelly bean, that really puts me in a social chatty sort
[02:40:12.810 --> 02:40:13.810]  of a mood.
[02:40:13.810 --> 02:40:15.890]  So something like that would really help you.
[02:40:15.890 --> 02:40:18.910]  I'm going to continue reading more parts of your email because you asked a whole bunch
[02:40:18.910 --> 02:40:19.910]  of stuff.
[02:40:19.910 --> 02:40:20.910]  You asked a weird question.
[02:40:20.910 --> 02:40:24.130]  It says, does Irie currently have any med strains?
[02:40:24.130 --> 02:40:28.010]  And if so, what do they treat?
[02:40:28.010 --> 02:40:31.490]  I think all cannabis grown is a medical strain.
[02:40:31.490 --> 02:40:35.950]  It's just marketing is what some people say this is a medical strain.
[02:40:35.950 --> 02:40:36.950]  It's all medicinal.
[02:40:36.950 --> 02:40:38.010]  It's all got THC.
[02:40:38.010 --> 02:40:42.690]  It's all got some sort of ratio of cannabinoids and terpenoids in there.
[02:40:42.690 --> 02:40:43.690]  It's all medical.
[02:40:43.690 --> 02:40:45.970]  So that's kind of a strange question.
[02:40:45.970 --> 02:40:49.650]  Does it mean is it sold at a dispensary or what qualifies a strain as medical?
[02:40:49.650 --> 02:40:51.810]  Email me back and tell me what you mean by that.
[02:40:51.810 --> 02:40:52.850]  I think I know what you mean.
[02:40:52.850 --> 02:40:54.090]  They're all medical.
[02:40:54.090 --> 02:40:58.850]  So yes, all of my strains are medical or they're also all recreational.
[02:40:58.850 --> 02:41:02.870]  Everything I break could be used for recreation or medicine or both.
[02:41:02.870 --> 02:41:04.910]  When I smoke, it's a little bit of both, honestly.
[02:41:04.910 --> 02:41:08.530]  It's a 50-50 mix of recreational and medical.
[02:41:08.530 --> 02:41:10.010]  I'm smoking because I like to smoke.
[02:41:10.010 --> 02:41:13.330]  I partially just like the ritual of hanging out with my bros and taking some dabs and
[02:41:13.330 --> 02:41:14.330]  laughing.
[02:41:14.330 --> 02:41:19.330]  I also like getting a nice head high and being giggly and having a stupid grin on my face.
[02:41:19.330 --> 02:41:23.970]  And then I also like that when I smoke, I have pain and I have some issues and those
[02:41:23.970 --> 02:41:27.070]  issues go away when I smoke or at least are alleviated.
[02:41:27.070 --> 02:41:30.430]  So it's a nice mix of recreational and medicinal.
[02:41:30.430 --> 02:41:32.510]  So any plant could be both.
[02:41:32.510 --> 02:41:34.310]  So let's get a little more into your email.
[02:41:34.310 --> 02:41:36.710]  He says, I got one last question, brah.
[02:41:36.710 --> 02:41:41.070]  I hear that a one-to-one CBD to THC ratio strains are good for that.
[02:41:41.070 --> 02:41:44.070]  And he's referring to the pain, inflammation, and anxiety.
[02:41:44.070 --> 02:41:48.990]  He says, but I guess my question is if I buy a 10-pack of a strain, and I'm not going to
[02:41:48.990 --> 02:41:51.310]  say the name of the strain that you put in the email because I don't want to include
[02:41:51.310 --> 02:41:53.030]  that into our conversation.
[02:41:53.030 --> 02:41:58.470]  I says, if I buy a 10-pack of a strain, let's say I get a 10-pack of non-femme seeds and
[02:41:58.470 --> 02:41:59.470]  I pop them all.
[02:41:59.470 --> 02:42:01.590]  Let's say they all germ and turn out female.
[02:42:01.590 --> 02:42:03.990]  And let's say they are all different phenos.
[02:42:03.990 --> 02:42:06.910]  Is that ratio of one-to-one change within the progeny?
[02:42:06.910 --> 02:42:10.150]  If so, how do you know what you were getting exactly?
[02:42:10.150 --> 02:42:11.150]  Get my question.
[02:42:11.150 --> 02:42:15.950]  Lots of seed banks provide ratios, but even I know that I'm probably not going to get
[02:42:15.950 --> 02:42:19.350]  that same plant in the pick, but I will get the genes.
[02:42:19.350 --> 02:42:21.730]  And then he says, sorry for the long ass email.
[02:42:21.730 --> 02:42:22.730]  Much love to you, homie.
[02:42:23.030 --> 02:42:24.030]  Keep up the good work.
[02:42:24.030 --> 02:42:27.990]  One of these days, I'm going to go to Colorado and I'd love to meet you.
[02:42:27.990 --> 02:42:28.990]  And he says, no homo.
[02:42:28.990 --> 02:42:29.990]  No homo, bro.
[02:42:29.990 --> 02:42:30.990]  I'd love to meet you too, bro.
[02:42:30.990 --> 02:42:31.990]  Fist bump.
[02:42:31.990 --> 02:42:34.430]  And then he says, and do a dab with you, or maybe not.
[02:42:34.430 --> 02:42:35.870]  Probably just burn leaf like usual.
[02:42:35.870 --> 02:42:39.870]  Dabs are a little scary, especially when you have panic and anxiety.
[02:42:39.870 --> 02:42:42.630]  Bro, I truly appreciate that long ass email.
[02:42:42.630 --> 02:42:45.390]  Now I'm going to answer your last question there.
[02:42:45.390 --> 02:42:49.750]  If you bought a 10-pack of seeds that were advertised to have a one-to-one THC to CBD
[02:42:49.850 --> 02:42:54.210]  ratio, and you were lucky enough to get all females, well, I don't know about lucky enough.
[02:42:54.210 --> 02:42:56.050]  I'd hope for a male in there because I'm a breeder.
[02:42:56.050 --> 02:42:59.270]  I'd want a couple of males to choose from, hopefully three to pick from.
[02:42:59.270 --> 02:43:03.730]  But if you got that pack of 10 females that you're hoping for, and you flower them out,
[02:43:03.730 --> 02:43:08.690]  the only way you're going to know what type of CBD to THC ratios you actually got are
[02:43:08.690 --> 02:43:12.530]  by flowering those plants, drying and curing the buds, and taking that finished product
[02:43:12.530 --> 02:43:14.970]  to a testing facility to test for you.
[02:43:14.970 --> 02:43:18.650]  That's the only way you're going to guarantee what you've got.
[02:43:18.650 --> 02:43:22.710]  The best way to do it is to grow them out and keep the plant that works best for your
[02:43:22.710 --> 02:43:24.230]  medicinal needs.
[02:43:24.230 --> 02:43:27.790]  That may not be the one-to-one ratio, but you may find that golden nugget in there that
[02:43:27.790 --> 02:43:29.710]  works perfectly for you.
[02:43:29.710 --> 02:43:35.070]  So I guess to answer your question, you do have a good chance of getting exactly what's
[02:43:35.070 --> 02:43:36.070]  advertised.
[02:43:36.070 --> 02:43:40.070]  It depends on how much testing the breeder did before they released the strains, and
[02:43:40.070 --> 02:43:47.010]  it also kind of depends on how much stabilization the breeder did before they released the strains.
[02:43:47.070 --> 02:43:50.630]  Sometimes you can make an F1 that comes out nice and uniform.
[02:43:50.630 --> 02:43:55.130]  Sometimes you make an F1 that throws out phenotypes that are all over the place.
[02:43:55.130 --> 02:43:59.950]  Sometimes that F2 will throw out even more variation, but that F3, you'll start narrowing
[02:43:59.950 --> 02:44:00.950]  it down.
[02:44:00.950 --> 02:44:03.190]  You start narrowing it down.
[02:44:03.190 --> 02:44:07.910]  If the breeder does it right, you should get what's advertised very regularly, but you'll
[02:44:07.910 --> 02:44:09.670]  have to do the pheno hunting.
[02:44:09.670 --> 02:44:11.790]  That's what you're going to have to do.
[02:44:11.790 --> 02:44:17.370]  Don't rely too much on the numbers as much as what it does for you.
[02:44:17.370 --> 02:44:22.890]  Put them all, grow all the plants, dry them, cure them, and label them A, B, C, whatever.
[02:44:22.890 --> 02:44:27.370]  Give them a number and then smoke them, and then figure out which one of those you like.
[02:44:27.370 --> 02:44:31.670]  Don't let the looks of the plant, the color of the plant, don't let that be your judge.
[02:44:31.670 --> 02:44:33.450]  Let the effects be your judge.
[02:44:33.450 --> 02:44:36.250]  So you will have a good chance of getting that one.
[02:44:36.250 --> 02:44:40.370]  I'm getting off topic, but you will have a good chance of getting what was advertised,
[02:44:40.370 --> 02:44:41.690]  but it's hard to guarantee it.
[02:44:42.590 --> 02:44:43.590]  It depends on the breeder.
[02:44:43.590 --> 02:44:46.910]  It depends on the conditions in your grow room.
[02:44:46.910 --> 02:44:49.830]  Phenotypical expression is very much based on your grow room.
[02:44:49.830 --> 02:44:54.510]  If your room is too humid or too dry or too hot or too cold, you're not going to get those
[02:44:54.510 --> 02:44:59.750]  phenotypes that were advertised because those were grown under probably perfect conditions
[02:44:59.750 --> 02:45:01.870]  if they were done by professional breeders.
[02:45:01.870 --> 02:45:03.870]  They've got very great rooms to grow in.
[02:45:03.870 --> 02:45:06.330]  So they grew that plant to its full potential.
[02:45:06.330 --> 02:45:08.870]  They got the phenotypical expression they were looking for.
[02:45:08.870 --> 02:45:11.510]  So you've got to get your room up to par also.
[02:45:12.330 --> 02:45:18.010]  But the short answer is yes, the different phenos will possibly carry different ratios
[02:45:18.010 --> 02:45:19.910]  of THC to CBD.
[02:45:19.910 --> 02:45:25.630]  I've seen it very, very widely in F1 hybrids made by friends of mine, but I've seen them
[02:45:25.630 --> 02:45:31.530]  stabilize it down to where we can get quite uniform seeds that are high in CBD.
[02:45:31.530 --> 02:45:33.170]  So that's the long answer.
[02:45:33.170 --> 02:45:35.970]  I wish I had a shorter answer for you because I feel like that one took forever.
[02:45:35.970 --> 02:45:37.770]  Dude, I definitely appreciate the email.
[02:45:37.770 --> 02:45:38.770]  You gave me a lot of great content.
[02:45:38.770 --> 02:45:39.770]  Shout out to you.
[02:45:40.030 --> 02:45:43.710]  I'm not going to say your name on the show, but I encourage you to send me some more emails.
[02:45:43.710 --> 02:45:45.670]  I encourage everybody out there to send me an email.
[02:45:45.670 --> 02:45:46.670]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[02:45:46.670 --> 02:45:49.670]  If you've got something to say, I would love to hear it.
[02:45:49.670 --> 02:45:51.910]  I want to thank everybody who sent me an email.
[02:45:51.910 --> 02:45:54.550]  Once again, I hope to hear from more people in the future.
[02:45:54.550 --> 02:45:56.630]  You guys, my throat is going completely dry.
[02:45:56.630 --> 02:45:59.870]  I'm going to get some water, take a bunch of dabs and chill out for the evening.
[02:45:59.870 --> 02:46:01.350]  I hope you guys are all kicking it too.
[02:46:01.350 --> 02:46:03.550]  I want to thank you guys for listening to this episode.
[02:46:03.550 --> 02:46:05.590]  I'll be back in a few days with another show.
[02:46:05.590 --> 02:46:07.110]  I've got a great interview lined up.
[02:46:07.110 --> 02:46:09.930]  I don't want to talk about it because a lot of times things fall through and then I sound
[02:46:09.930 --> 02:46:10.930]  like I was talking shit.
[02:46:10.930 --> 02:46:13.170]  I've got an interview lined up that I'm excited about.
[02:46:13.170 --> 02:46:15.130]  I've got a couple of great guests coming real soon.
[02:46:15.130 --> 02:46:17.970]  We're going to do an episode about how to deal with law enforcement.
[02:46:17.970 --> 02:46:21.810]  I've got an episode lined up about how to get your MED badge so that you can work in
[02:46:21.810 --> 02:46:23.810]  the legal industry here in Colorado.
[02:46:23.810 --> 02:46:26.770]  I hope to get Rob from Sour Seeds on the show real soon.
[02:46:26.770 --> 02:46:29.530]  We will talk about selecting male plants for breeding.
[02:46:29.530 --> 02:46:30.890]  I've got a lot of stuff lined up.
[02:46:30.890 --> 02:46:35.490]  You guys, I'm lining up a live show at the Cana Canyon with our friend Fox.
[02:46:35.510 --> 02:46:37.230]  I hope to have an audience there.
[02:46:37.230 --> 02:46:38.350]  We're going to be interactive.
[02:46:38.350 --> 02:46:39.350]  We will take your questions.
[02:46:39.350 --> 02:46:41.070]  I will let you know when that's going to happen.
[02:46:41.070 --> 02:46:42.070]  We're finalizing a date.
[02:46:42.070 --> 02:46:43.670]  I'm waiting on word from the Cana Canyon.
[02:46:43.670 --> 02:46:44.670]  We'll get that going.
[02:46:44.670 --> 02:46:47.990]  Somebody asked me to do an episode about vitamin B and enzymes.
[02:46:47.990 --> 02:46:50.070]  I'm hoping to get Sean on the show for that one.
[02:46:50.070 --> 02:46:51.350]  He will have a lot to say.
[02:46:51.350 --> 02:46:56.510]  He's got a horticultural degree, a huge horticultural background, so he will have a lot to share
[02:46:56.510 --> 02:46:57.510]  on that one.
[02:46:57.510 --> 02:47:00.470]  I need to give one more huge shout out to our sponsor, Hitman Glass.
[02:47:00.470 --> 02:47:02.230]  Make sure you follow Hitman Glass on Instagram.
[02:47:02.230 --> 02:47:04.030]  It's at Hitman Glass Dougie.

[02:47:25.090 --> 02:47:26.090]  Much love.
[02:47:26.090 --> 02:47:27.090]  Big thanks.
[02:47:27.090 --> 02:47:28.970]  I want to give a huge shout out to my ninja Spence.
[02:47:28.970 --> 02:47:32.210]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
