[00:00.000 --> 00:15.000]  Oh shit, lost a Jeff in the house.
[00:16.000 --> 00:18.000]  This baby hits 88 miles per hour.
[00:19.000 --> 00:21.000]  You're gonna see some serious shit.
[00:21.000 --> 00:22.000]  Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit.
[00:22.000 --> 00:24.000]  Man, what you gonna do now?
[00:24.000 --> 00:25.000]  What we gonna do right here is go back.
[00:25.000 --> 00:26.000]  Before you going back.
[00:26.000 --> 00:27.000]  Way back.
[00:28.000 --> 00:30.000]  As we go a little something like this.
[00:30.000 --> 00:31.000]  Hit it!
[00:45.000 --> 00:49.000]  Anyways, any promotions or any contests, all of that stuff has expired.
[00:49.000 --> 00:54.000]  There are no advertisements, promotions, giveaways or contests that are valid in these old episodes.
[00:54.000 --> 00:57.000]  I want to thank you guys for listening and with no further ado,
[00:57.000 --> 01:01.000]  here's a block of old episodes of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:02.000 --> 01:19.540]  Welcome back cannabis community.
[01:19.540 --> 01:22.540]  It is time for episode number 123 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:22.540 --> 01:28.070]  Your source for cannabis news, education and conversation.
[01:28.070 --> 01:31.070]  If you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[01:31.070 --> 01:35.070]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[01:35.070 --> 01:38.070]  this my friends is the podcast for you.
[01:38.070 --> 01:40.070]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:40.070 --> 01:42.070]  I want to thank you once again for joining me.
[01:42.070 --> 01:46.070]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[01:46.070 --> 01:48.070]  for letting me use their music on my show.
[01:48.070 --> 01:52.070]  Big shout out to Kat, Coot and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:52.070 --> 01:55.070]  I want to dedicate this episode to my friend Zach.
[01:55.070 --> 01:57.070]  We lost Zach to cystic fibrosis this month.
[01:57.070 --> 02:01.070]  So, fuck you cystic fibrosis and Zach, I miss you and I love you brother.
[02:01.070 --> 02:02.070]  This dab is for you.
[02:02.070 --> 02:07.070]  I'm going to take a little dab because Zach had cystic fibrosis and it messed with his lungs really badly.
[02:07.070 --> 02:10.070]  If he took too big of a dab, he would sound just like the bong.
[02:10.070 --> 02:11.070]  So, we're going to take a little dab for him.
[02:11.070 --> 02:12.070]  We're going to breathe in some love.
[02:12.070 --> 02:13.070]  We're going to blow out some bullshit.
[02:13.070 --> 02:15.070]  This dab is for you brother Zach.
[02:15.070 --> 02:16.070]  Everybody dab with me.
[02:27.060 --> 02:28.060]  Alright, that was a big nice dab.
[02:28.060 --> 02:30.060]  Zach, I'm going to miss you brother.
[02:30.060 --> 02:31.060]  It's not going to be the same.
[02:32.060 --> 02:34.060]  Yeah, much love, much respect.
[02:34.060 --> 02:35.060]  Shout out to Tim also if you're listening.
[02:35.060 --> 02:38.060]  Tim, I hope we get together sometime soon and celebrate Zach.
[02:38.060 --> 02:41.060]  Alright, so ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you for joining me.
[02:41.060 --> 02:44.060]  This episode will come mostly from the Canna Canyon.
[02:44.060 --> 02:54.060]  The Canna Canyon is my favorite cannabis social lounge in Colorado Springs where we are allowed to congregate and socialize and smoke recreational cannabis like a responsible adult should be allowed to.
[02:54.060 --> 02:59.060]  So, before I get to that, I want to talk about something I've been seeing on Facebook.
[02:59.060 --> 03:03.060]  The Cannabis Cup for Colorado has been canceled for the year 2016.
[03:03.060 --> 03:06.060]  There will be no Cannabis Cup over the 420 weekend.
[03:06.060 --> 03:09.060]  High Times intended to have the event in Denver, Colorado.
[03:09.060 --> 03:15.060]  Adams County, I believe it was, rejected all of the permits and would not let High Times have their event.
[03:15.060 --> 03:19.060]  High Times had to scramble to find a new location for the Cannabis Cup.
[03:19.060 --> 03:21.060]  They opted to try Pueblo.
[03:21.060 --> 03:24.060]  They put in applications for permits.
[03:25.060 --> 03:32.060]  They decided through that process that there would not be enough time to advertise and organize a Cannabis Cup should the event be approved.
[03:32.060 --> 03:42.060]  So, what I've seen a lot on Facebook is people bitching out High Times and people bitching out the city of Pueblo and people bitching out the city of Denver for a Cannabis Cup not happening.
[03:42.060 --> 03:44.060]  Hey guys, this was a huge event.
[03:44.060 --> 03:46.060]  There's a lot of risk involved.
[03:46.060 --> 03:50.060]  We can't blame any city for an event not happening.
[03:50.060 --> 03:51.060]  Maybe Denver.
[03:51.060 --> 03:53.060]  They did kick High Times out.
[03:53.060 --> 03:54.060]  They did not approve the permit.
[03:54.060 --> 03:56.060]  So, maybe we can be mad at them.
[03:56.060 --> 04:02.060]  But it is not High Times' fault nor is it Pueblo's fault that this event did not happen in the backup plan of Pueblo.
[04:02.060 --> 04:07.060]  High Times submitted the permits and High Times also pulled the permits.
[04:07.060 --> 04:12.060]  They decided, or the applications for permits, they decided to stop the process.
[04:12.060 --> 04:16.060]  So, there wasn't enough time to get an event together even if Pueblo did approve it.
[04:16.060 --> 04:18.060]  So, High Times just decided to pull the plug.
[04:18.060 --> 04:20.060]  We can't blame it on anybody.
[04:20.060 --> 04:21.060]  Let's quit pointing fingers.
[04:21.060 --> 04:22.060]  Let's all be friends again.
[04:22.060 --> 04:23.060]  Let's get back together.
[04:23.060 --> 04:24.060]  Let's dab like we used to.
[04:24.060 --> 04:25.060]  Let's be a community.
[04:25.060 --> 04:27.060]  That's what I have to say about that.
[04:27.060 --> 04:31.060]  We will talk a little bit about this in the episode when my friends join me.
[04:31.060 --> 04:35.060]  Since there is no Cannabis Cup, you guys, let me invite you to The Secret Sesh.
[04:35.060 --> 04:37.060]  The Secret Sesh is hosted by Gatsby Gardens.
[04:37.060 --> 04:39.060]  We will have a ton of great sponsors.
[04:39.060 --> 04:42.060]  Our friend Adam Ill is coming from California to host the event.
[04:42.060 --> 04:43.060]  I will be there.
[04:43.060 --> 04:44.060]  The Grimy Gatsby will be there.
[04:44.060 --> 04:46.060]  Our friend Duditz Damsel will be there.
[04:46.060 --> 04:51.060]  There will be a lot of people there dabbing, vending, having a grand 420 time.
[04:51.060 --> 04:52.060]  I hope you can join us.
[04:52.060 --> 04:56.060]  Follow Secret Sesh Colorado on Instagram for more information.
[04:56.060 --> 05:00.060]  As soon as I have more info, I will get it to you.
[05:00.060 --> 05:05.060]  You guys, I talked about doing an episode about what you could do if you came to Pueblo for the Cannabis Cup.
[05:05.060 --> 05:10.060]  Obviously, there's no point in doing that because you're not going to come here because there's not a Cannabis Cup.
[05:10.060 --> 05:12.060]  So, I apologize for teasing you about that.
[05:12.060 --> 05:16.060]  If there's something you'd like to know about the city of Pueblo, Colorado, send me an email.
[05:16.060 --> 05:18.060]  GrowFromYourHeart at Hotmail.com.
[05:18.060 --> 05:21.060]  I will answer the email and we'll talk about Pueblo.
[05:21.060 --> 05:23.060]  A lot of people are talking about moving here.
[05:23.060 --> 05:26.060]  There's some things that you should know and things you probably didn't think of.
[05:26.060 --> 05:27.060]  We'll talk about those.
[05:27.060 --> 05:28.060]  All right, you guys.
[05:28.060 --> 05:30.060]  I think it is time for us to time warp.
[05:30.060 --> 05:36.060]  We're going to travel back in time to just a couple of days ago when I met with my friend Camille with Stephen DeFino.
[05:36.060 --> 05:37.060]  Who else was there?
[05:37.060 --> 05:38.060]  Kabuki J. Fox and my new friend Matt.
[05:38.060 --> 05:43.060]  We all gathered at the Cannon Canyon on 1507 Colorado Boulevard, I think.
[05:43.060 --> 05:44.060]  Boulevard?
[05:44.060 --> 05:46.060]  It's 1507 Colorado in Colorado Springs.
[05:46.060 --> 05:47.060]  It's a great place.
[05:47.060 --> 05:48.060]  So, we're going to time warp.
[05:48.060 --> 05:51.060]  I'm going to put on some music and we are going to journey back in time.
[05:51.060 --> 05:54.060]  When we get back, we will be at the Cannon Canyon.
[05:54.060 --> 06:07.700]  All right, Podcast World.
[06:07.700 --> 06:10.700]  We are here at the Cannon Canyon in Colorado Springs.
[06:10.700 --> 06:12.700]  Camille, will you remind me the address, please, because I'm high as shit.
[06:12.700 --> 06:16.700]  1507 West Colorado Avenue.
[06:16.700 --> 06:17.700]  Thank you so much.
[06:17.700 --> 06:19.700]  So, come down to 1507 West Colorado Avenue.
[06:19.700 --> 06:21.700]  Check out the Cannon Canyon.
[06:21.700 --> 06:22.700]  It's a great place.
[06:22.700 --> 06:23.700]  The couches are comfy.
[06:23.700 --> 06:25.700]  The tables are covered in rigs and they've got an e-mail.
[06:25.700 --> 06:26.700]  Come hit it.
[06:26.700 --> 06:27.700]  So, guys, welcome to the show.
[06:27.700 --> 06:30.700]  Sitting a little further to my left is our good friend Camille.
[06:30.700 --> 06:31.700]  Thank you for joining me.
[06:31.700 --> 06:32.700]  You're welcome.
[06:32.700 --> 06:33.700]  Thanks for having me.
[06:33.700 --> 06:34.700]  Thanks for coming.
[06:34.700 --> 06:35.700]  You've got such a great smile.
[06:35.700 --> 06:36.700]  I'm happy to be here.
[06:36.700 --> 06:37.700]  It's a good day.
[06:37.700 --> 06:38.700]  You look great today.
[06:38.700 --> 06:41.700]  Sitting to my immediate left over here is our good friend Stephen DeFino.
[06:41.700 --> 06:44.700]  You are the president and founder of the Veteran Farmers Alliance.
[06:44.700 --> 06:45.700]  Is that correct?
[06:45.700 --> 06:46.700]  That is correct.
[06:46.700 --> 06:47.700]  Thanks for doing that and thanks for being on the show.
[06:47.700 --> 06:48.700]  Thanks.
[06:48.700 --> 06:49.700]  Glad to be here.
[06:49.700 --> 06:50.700]  Dude, thanks for coming.
[06:50.700 --> 06:53.700]  Over here to my kind of far to the right is our buddy Kabuki J. Fox.
[06:53.700 --> 06:54.700]  How are you doing, bro?
[06:54.700 --> 06:55.700]  I'm awesome, man.
[06:55.700 --> 06:56.700]  Thanks for having me back.
[06:56.700 --> 06:57.700]  You are awesome as shit.
[06:57.700 --> 06:58.700]  Thanks for joining me.
[06:58.700 --> 06:59.700]  I appreciate it.
[06:59.700 --> 07:00.700]  Hashtag run CBD.
[07:00.700 --> 07:01.700]  All day.
[07:01.700 --> 07:02.700]  Hashtag Terps4Tots.
[07:02.700 --> 07:03.700]  Yes.
[07:03.700 --> 07:04.700]  All right.
[07:04.700 --> 07:06.700]  So, sitting to my right is kind of a new friend.
[07:06.700 --> 07:07.700]  Remind me your name, my friend.
[07:07.700 --> 07:08.700]  Matthew Kale.
[07:08.700 --> 07:09.700]  Matthew Kale.
[07:09.700 --> 07:10.700]  Yes.
[07:10.700 --> 07:14.700]  I'm with an outfit here, Veterans for Natural Rights.
[07:14.700 --> 07:21.700]  I'm one of the individuals that helps out with the event the other night at the Dab Lounge.
[07:21.700 --> 07:22.700]  And thank you for doing that.
[07:22.700 --> 07:23.700]  Yeah, thanks for doing that.
[07:23.700 --> 07:25.700]  We're going to talk a lot about that.
[07:25.700 --> 07:27.700]  Before we get to that, so thanks for joining me, everybody.
[07:27.700 --> 07:29.700]  Before we get to that, and let me put a disclaimer out there.
[07:29.700 --> 07:31.700]  Camille is working at the Canna Canyon.
[07:31.700 --> 07:32.700]  She is the host.
[07:32.700 --> 07:33.700]  And are you the owner here?
[07:33.700 --> 07:34.700]  Is that correct?
[07:34.700 --> 07:35.700]  I am co-owner.
[07:35.700 --> 07:36.700]  Co-owner.
[07:36.700 --> 07:39.700]  So, she may have to stand up and take off and go for a run at any given moment here.
[07:39.700 --> 07:41.700]  So, excuse her if that happens.
[07:41.700 --> 07:45.700]  We'll try to get some of her stuff covered in the beginning of the show here.
[07:45.700 --> 07:51.700]  So, one thing I want to talk about with everybody, the Cannabis Cup for Colorado has officially been canceled.
[07:51.700 --> 07:52.700]  Jesus.
[07:52.700 --> 07:53.700]  What?
[07:53.700 --> 07:54.700]  What?
[07:54.700 --> 07:55.700]  I know.
[07:55.700 --> 07:56.700]  Yeah, we were all stoked about that.
[07:56.700 --> 08:00.700]  I'm sure everybody here had an idea of something they wanted to do for 420 and for the Cannabis Cup.
[08:00.700 --> 08:01.700]  Absolutely.
[08:01.700 --> 08:05.700]  On the flip side, I will say I am fairly excited.
[08:05.700 --> 08:12.700]  I think that this is going to be kind of the turn of 420 being about private events.
[08:12.700 --> 08:14.700]  I'm kind of excited about that.
[08:14.700 --> 08:17.700]  I know the Secret Sesh is happening up in Denver.
[08:17.700 --> 08:18.700]  That's going to be awesome.
[08:18.700 --> 08:19.700]  Shout out to the Sesh.
[08:19.700 --> 08:20.700]  Yeah.
[08:20.700 --> 08:22.700]  We're planning on doing something as well.
[08:22.700 --> 08:26.700]  I can't talk too much about what we're planning on doing, but I am excited.
[08:26.700 --> 08:32.700]  I think that this is kind of a new wave of a different 420.
[08:32.700 --> 08:33.700]  I think it's going to be cool.
[08:33.700 --> 08:37.700]  I like the way that you put that because that kind of works me into part of what I wanted to talk about.
[08:37.700 --> 08:40.700]  The importance of consumption clubs.
[08:40.700 --> 08:47.700]  Since they're not going to let us have large events like that, we need to have places like the Canna Canyon to consume our cannabis.
[08:47.700 --> 08:49.700]  For people to come and socialize.
[08:49.700 --> 08:52.700]  All we're doing is hanging out and consuming cannabis and being friends here.
[08:52.700 --> 08:53.700]  Absolutely.
[08:53.700 --> 08:56.700]  We definitely need something like this.
[08:56.700 --> 09:02.700]  Before we get to that, let's talk about the Veteran Farmers Alliance event that happened a couple of days ago.
[09:02.700 --> 09:04.700]  I want to give you a huge shout out, Steven.
[09:04.700 --> 09:05.700]  That was a huge event.
[09:05.700 --> 09:07.700]  How many people do you think showed up?
[09:07.700 --> 09:08.700]  It was awesome.
[09:08.700 --> 09:09.700]  Let's see.
[09:09.700 --> 09:12.700]  I'd say, what do you think, Matt?
[09:12.700 --> 09:13.700]  Probably a little over 200?
[09:13.700 --> 09:16.700]  I think it was a little more than that, honestly.
[09:16.700 --> 09:18.700]  Over the course of the day.
[09:18.700 --> 09:20.700]  Easy 300.
[09:20.700 --> 09:21.700]  From 10 to 7.
[09:21.700 --> 09:24.700]  We didn't leave until 11 or 10 that night.
[09:24.700 --> 09:28.700]  Steven hosted an event at the Dab Lounge in Colorado Springs.
[09:28.700 --> 09:30.700]  It's another social smoke lounge.
[09:30.700 --> 09:32.700]  Shout out to the Dab Lounge.
[09:32.700 --> 09:34.700]  Thank you, Dan, for letting us host that event.
[09:34.700 --> 09:35.700]  Absolutely.
[09:35.700 --> 09:36.700]  Super nice event.
[09:36.700 --> 09:37.700]  Shout out to that dude.
[09:37.700 --> 09:40.700]  Steven hosted an event there called the Veteran Farmers Alliance.
[09:40.700 --> 09:41.700]  Was that an official title?
[09:41.700 --> 09:43.700]  The Veteran Farmers Alliance.
[09:43.700 --> 09:45.700]  Get together, party, smoke out, sesh.
[09:45.700 --> 09:46.700]  Have a good time.
[09:46.700 --> 09:47.700]  All right.
[09:47.700 --> 09:50.700]  Can you tell us a little bit about the Veteran Farmers Alliance?
[09:50.700 --> 09:51.700]  Absolutely.
[09:51.700 --> 09:54.700]  Basically, the Veteran Farmers Alliance brings the community together.
[09:54.700 --> 09:56.700]  Brings veterans together with civilians.
[09:56.700 --> 10:04.700]  Brings breeders together, growers together, nutrient manufacturers, and glass blowers.
[10:04.700 --> 10:08.700]  It just takes everybody and brings them all in one place
[10:08.700 --> 10:14.700]  and allows these guys to have free genetics, free information, education,
[10:14.700 --> 10:18.700]  all that, and they're able to get in one centralized location
[10:18.700 --> 10:22.700]  to where they can have good medicine,
[10:22.700 --> 10:24.700]  they can get the best medicine that's out there.
[10:24.700 --> 10:26.700]  It's not this watered-down crap.
[10:26.700 --> 10:29.700]  No, these are fresh genetics, good genetics, and these guys care.
[10:29.700 --> 10:32.700]  So we had 300 people came through this event.
[10:32.700 --> 10:36.700]  Inside of the Dab Lounge, we had breeders set up with their booths.
[10:36.700 --> 10:37.700]  They had seeds available.
[10:37.700 --> 10:39.700]  We had nutrient companies.
[10:39.700 --> 10:40.700]  We had glass companies.
[10:40.700 --> 10:45.700]  And all of these companies threw down stacks of merchandise for the veterans.
[10:45.700 --> 10:46.700]  Absolutely.
[10:46.700 --> 10:47.700]  They did.
[10:47.700 --> 10:51.700]  Can I ask about what the value of the prizes you gave away was that day without being rude?
[10:51.700 --> 10:55.700]  Well, the total value was just a little over $12,000.
[10:55.700 --> 11:00.700]  $12,000 with the products given to veterans to help them grow better cannabis,
[11:00.700 --> 11:03.700]  to fight their PTSD, their pain, their depression, their anxiety.
[11:03.700 --> 11:04.700]  Absolutely.
[11:04.700 --> 11:05.700]  Awesome.
[11:05.700 --> 11:06.700]  Dude, I want to give you a fist bump.
[11:06.700 --> 11:07.700]  Thank you for doing that.
[11:07.700 --> 11:08.700]  Yeah, no problem.
[11:08.700 --> 11:09.700]  That's hugely respectable.
[11:09.700 --> 11:11.700]  And also thanks to these guys to the right.
[11:11.700 --> 11:13.700]  They all showed up and dabbed with me and got to hang out.
[11:13.700 --> 11:14.700]  No problem.
[11:14.700 --> 11:15.700]  Thanks to the Run CBD hoodie.
[11:15.700 --> 11:16.700]  It looks sharp on me.
[11:16.700 --> 11:17.700]  Anytime, dude.
[11:17.700 --> 11:18.700]  Yeah, it did.
[11:18.700 --> 11:19.700]  You look good in purple, man.
[11:19.700 --> 11:20.700]  You look good in the picture, bro.
[11:20.700 --> 11:21.700]  Shout out.
[11:21.700 --> 11:22.700]  Check us out on Instagram, you guys.
[11:22.700 --> 11:23.700]  All right.
[11:23.700 --> 11:27.700]  So we are in Colorado Springs tonight, you guys, and last night there was a city council meeting.
[11:27.700 --> 11:29.700]  Everybody's facial expressions all just changed.
[11:29.700 --> 11:32.700]  Everyone's body language just deflated a little.
[11:32.700 --> 11:35.700]  At this city council meeting, a lot of things went down.
[11:35.700 --> 11:36.700]  I live in another city.
[11:36.700 --> 11:37.700]  I was trying to keep up.
[11:37.700 --> 11:45.700]  What I understand is they have put a moratorium on more social clubs like this, and in eight years, are all clubs like this forced to close?
[11:45.700 --> 11:46.700]  Yes.
[11:46.700 --> 11:47.700]  Yes.
[11:47.700 --> 11:50.700]  So the moratorium was actually set in place back in September.
[11:50.700 --> 11:53.700]  Six months, the moratorium set.
[11:53.700 --> 11:59.700]  So we are re-approaching that six-month mark of the moratorium.
[11:59.700 --> 12:03.700]  And so I think they're just trying to establish what they want to do with that.
[12:04.700 --> 12:13.700]  And what they decided was they wanted to ban them, originally supposed to be for five years, but they extended it to eight years.
[12:13.700 --> 12:15.700]  Kind of a blow.
[12:15.700 --> 12:19.700]  But at the same time, this is what the voters wanted.
[12:19.700 --> 12:21.700]  We're very passionate about that.
[12:21.700 --> 12:25.700]  That's what we believe in, and that's what we're going to fight for.
[12:25.700 --> 12:27.700]  So this isn't the end.
[12:27.700 --> 12:28.700]  This is just the beginning.
[12:28.700 --> 12:29.700]  Okay.
[12:29.700 --> 12:30.700]  I like your faith in that.
[12:30.700 --> 12:31.700]  Yeah.
[12:31.700 --> 12:34.700]  The way that it's written, does that mean that in eight years you have to close?
[12:34.700 --> 12:35.700]  Yes.
[12:35.700 --> 12:39.700]  In eight years, by March 2024, we will have to close our doors.
[12:39.700 --> 12:42.700]  And is there a second vote coming to—
[12:42.700 --> 12:43.700]  Right.
[12:43.700 --> 12:47.700]  So there's another vote on March 22nd, the second round of votes.
[12:47.700 --> 12:51.700]  But, you know, a lot can happen in eight years.
[12:51.700 --> 12:54.700]  Marijuana can become federally legal.
[12:54.700 --> 12:57.700]  It could go the opposite direction as well.
[12:58.700 --> 13:00.700]  That's true.
[13:00.700 --> 13:01.700]  I'm like, oh.
[13:01.700 --> 13:02.700]  Yeah.
[13:02.700 --> 13:04.700]  Well, you know, we have to be realist.
[13:04.700 --> 13:05.700]  We have to be realist.
[13:05.700 --> 13:08.700]  I mean, it could happen.
[13:08.700 --> 13:10.700]  So, yeah.
[13:10.700 --> 13:16.700]  It at least gives us a little bit of time to get a ballot referendum to allow these kind of clubs,
[13:16.700 --> 13:21.700]  and it gives us a little bit of time to force legislation on the issue,
[13:22.700 --> 13:29.700]  because Jonathan Singer himself and also the representative, Kit Roop, from Colorado Springs himself,
[13:29.700 --> 13:35.700]  he's backing a bill to legalize these types of clubs statewide.
[13:35.700 --> 13:42.700]  So these are already—we already know that there is a lot of support here in Colorado Springs.
[13:42.700 --> 13:45.700]  Otherwise, Kit Roop wouldn't be on board.
[13:45.700 --> 13:46.700]  Absolutely.
[13:47.700 --> 13:58.700]  I think another thing that really spoke volumes about that as well was the amount of people that showed up for that initial meeting on, like, February 22nd, 24th.
[13:58.700 --> 13:59.700]  Yeah.
[13:59.700 --> 14:01.700]  I mean, a standing room only.
[14:01.700 --> 14:09.700]  And I think there was only, like, two people out of, like, 120-plus that were against these clubs,
[14:09.700 --> 14:13.700]  and the majority of those people there were very much so for them, about them.
[14:13.700 --> 14:16.700]  And so that was very frustrating.
[14:16.700 --> 14:19.700]  But the community has spoken, so.
[14:19.700 --> 14:24.700]  I saw the—I watched part of the meeting on the Internet the other day, and the place was packed once again.
[14:24.700 --> 14:25.700]  We got to see—
[14:25.700 --> 14:26.700]  Passionate this time.
[14:26.700 --> 14:28.700]  We got to see our friend from the Lazy Lion.
[14:28.700 --> 14:30.700]  She had her ears off of City Council.
[14:30.700 --> 14:31.700]  Oh, no, yeah.
[14:31.700 --> 14:32.700]  That was awesome.
[14:32.700 --> 14:33.700]  Remind me of that guy's name.
[14:33.700 --> 14:34.700]  Andrew.
[14:34.700 --> 14:35.700]  Andrew, yeah.
[14:35.700 --> 14:36.700]  Shout out to Andrew.
[14:36.700 --> 14:37.700]  I like his balls, too.
[14:37.700 --> 14:38.700]  Those are some very well-spoken words.
[14:38.700 --> 14:39.700]  Way to put that one out there.
[14:39.700 --> 14:40.700]  Someone had to.
[14:40.700 --> 14:42.700]  Yeah, someone's got to do it, and I'm glad that he chose to do it.
[14:42.700 --> 14:44.700]  And he's a veteran also, so shout out to the veterans.
[14:44.700 --> 14:45.700]  Yeah.
[14:45.700 --> 14:46.700]  Yeah.
[14:46.700 --> 14:47.700]  It was cool that he came and supported the community.
[14:47.700 --> 14:49.700]  The vast majority of people there were veterans.
[14:49.700 --> 14:51.700]  How about the two City Council members?
[14:51.700 --> 14:54.700]  Was it—OK, yeah, Stephen, grab the microphone.
[14:54.700 --> 14:55.700]  Sure.
[14:55.700 --> 14:56.700]  OK, great.
[14:56.700 --> 15:02.700]  So I went up there to see, and I asked the City Council members, I said, how many of you are veterans?
[15:02.700 --> 15:04.700]  And they said, just by a show of hands, show me.
[15:04.700 --> 15:06.700]  None of them—not one of them raised their hands.
[15:06.700 --> 15:09.700]  They wouldn't acknowledge that they were veterans.
[15:09.700 --> 15:10.700]  That's disrespectful.
[15:10.700 --> 15:11.700]  Absolutely.
[15:11.700 --> 15:12.700]  That's disrespectful to the other veterans.
[15:12.700 --> 15:13.700]  And they are veterans.
[15:13.700 --> 15:14.700]  They are.
[15:14.700 --> 15:15.700]  Absolutely.
[15:15.700 --> 15:16.700]  That's disrespectful to their service.
[15:16.700 --> 15:18.700]  I'm sure that when they go other places, they get a veterans discount.
[15:18.700 --> 15:19.700]  Oh, sure.
[15:19.700 --> 15:20.700]  Of course.
[15:20.700 --> 15:21.700]  Sure.
[15:21.700 --> 15:22.700]  Do I get a veterans discount?
[15:22.700 --> 15:23.700]  Yes.
[15:23.700 --> 15:24.700]  Yeah.
[15:24.700 --> 15:25.700]  Will they raise their hand then?
[15:25.700 --> 15:26.700]  Yeah, probably.
[15:26.700 --> 15:27.700]  Absolutely.
[15:27.700 --> 15:30.700]  But, you know, they didn't raise their hands, so I turned around and I said, how many veterans are behind me?
[15:30.700 --> 15:33.700]  And like three-quarters of the room raised their hands.
[15:33.700 --> 15:34.700]  It was veterans.
[15:34.700 --> 15:35.700]  Yeah.
[15:35.700 --> 15:36.700]  Medical marijuana patients.
[15:36.700 --> 15:38.700]  These guys don't understand.
[15:38.700 --> 15:40.700]  This is a cry for help.
[15:40.700 --> 15:48.700]  And all those guys that raised their hands, all those guys and girls, we have to say that, they raised their hands and it's like they didn't care.
[15:48.700 --> 15:49.700]  They don't care.
[15:49.700 --> 15:51.700]  It was an emotional cry for help, too.
[15:51.700 --> 15:52.700]  It was.
[15:52.700 --> 15:53.700]  There were people breaking down on the stand.
[15:53.700 --> 15:54.700]  Absolutely.
[15:54.700 --> 15:59.700]  Talking about the importance of these clubs and the importance of these gathering places because they can't go anywhere else.
[15:59.700 --> 16:04.700]  They have lease agreements that prevent them from smoking in their own homes.
[16:04.700 --> 16:12.700]  These are people who serve their country and they're not allowed to take part in the freedoms that they're guaranteed by the constitution of the state they live in.
[16:12.700 --> 16:13.700]  It's a travesty.
[16:13.700 --> 16:15.700]  We could almost just end the show right there.
[16:15.700 --> 16:18.700]  That was – that's – yeah, that's exactly what's going on.
[16:18.700 --> 16:20.700]  So let's talk a little bit about the importance of these clubs.
[16:20.700 --> 16:21.700]  You've got something to say.
[16:21.700 --> 16:22.700]  Go for it.
[16:22.700 --> 16:30.700]  Yeah, I was just going to say, and not to mention, shout out to the Dab Lounge for providing an awesome space for those veterans to have the Veterans Farmers Alliance event.
[16:30.700 --> 16:37.700]  I mean if it wasn't for these social clubs, that community wouldn't be able to be brought together as easily.
[16:37.700 --> 16:40.700]  I gave veterans dabs for their first time.
[16:40.700 --> 16:41.700]  Yeah.
[16:41.700 --> 16:43.700]  I get to hang out with people who have never dabbed before.
[16:43.700 --> 16:48.700]  Kabuki, you're the one CBD sure and people want to know everything about CBD.
[16:48.700 --> 16:49.700]  Oh, yeah, of course.
[16:49.700 --> 16:50.700]  And it's awesome.
[16:50.700 --> 16:51.700]  And even through that event –
[16:51.700 --> 16:52.700]  CBD dabs are awesome.
[16:52.700 --> 16:53.700]  Oh, yeah, they are.
[16:53.700 --> 16:54.700]  They're great.
[16:54.700 --> 17:01.700]  When I was at the Veterans event, I met four sets of parents that had special needs children that were curious about cannabis and curious about CBD.
[17:01.700 --> 17:09.700]  And it's funny that places like this bring all sorts of patients throughout the spectrum together in some way or another.
[17:09.700 --> 17:17.700]  And we help each other, even if it's just lending an ear and understanding or being available and being introduced to someone and networking with someone that can help us.
[17:17.700 --> 17:29.700]  These clubs are absolutely essential to anyone who really is seeking a healthy social outlet in our community to not only discuss cannabis but why it works for them.
[17:29.700 --> 17:32.700]  And, you know, I really can't see anything healthier.
[17:32.700 --> 17:36.700]  You know, it saddens me to see it go the way that it has.
[17:36.700 --> 17:43.700]  And, you know, I'm happy to help fight it in any way possible because it's – well, it's bullshit.
[17:43.700 --> 17:45.700]  I mean I can't think of any other word.
[17:45.700 --> 17:46.700]  I agree with you.
[17:46.700 --> 17:48.700]  It just makes me sad, honestly.
[17:48.700 --> 17:53.700]  Working here also, I mean we see all types of members as well.
[17:53.700 --> 18:00.700]  And one thing that really kind of stands out to me is the amount of questions that people have that they're scared to ask.
[18:00.700 --> 18:01.700]  Yeah.
[18:01.700 --> 18:05.700]  Whether it's about CBD or THC or the benefits or –
[18:05.700 --> 18:07.700]  Or edibles or proper dosing.
[18:07.700 --> 18:08.700]  Right.
[18:08.700 --> 18:09.700]  Anything like that.
[18:09.700 --> 18:10.700]  We're talking about growing.
[18:10.700 --> 18:12.700]  Information that they might not get in a dispenser.
[18:12.700 --> 18:13.700]  Sorry to cut you off.
[18:13.700 --> 18:14.700]  Oh, go ahead, man.
[18:14.700 --> 18:16.700]  I think just adding on that point like that –
[18:16.700 --> 18:21.700]  We were having a conversation as friends at the front counter just a few minutes ago, just smoking dabs, talking about growing.
[18:21.700 --> 18:25.700]  And the folks behind us were learning everything we were saying.
[18:25.700 --> 18:26.700]  Yeah.
[18:26.700 --> 18:30.700]  And we were absorbing that as one of those people in that group was learning from us on accident.
[18:30.700 --> 18:31.700]  Oh, definitely.
[18:31.700 --> 18:34.700]  So the education and support they get just from showing up here is crucial.
[18:34.700 --> 18:35.700]  It's awesome.
[18:35.700 --> 18:36.700]  Yeah.
[18:36.700 --> 18:39.700]  We can go to a bar and drink alcohol until we die.
[18:39.700 --> 18:41.700]  You can physically drink enough alcohol at the bar.
[18:41.700 --> 18:42.700]  There's one bottle.
[18:42.700 --> 18:45.700]  If you drink that whole bottle of whatever you choose, it will kill you.
[18:45.700 --> 18:46.700]  Absolutely.
[18:46.700 --> 18:54.700]  You can come here and no one is going to let you smoke enough cannabis to hurt yourself, and I don't think you can smoke enough cannabis to hurt yourself.
[18:54.700 --> 18:58.700]  I will say that you could probably get high and do some dumb shit, and I can argue that.
[18:58.700 --> 18:59.700]  Absolutely.
[18:59.700 --> 19:02.700]  But, I mean, no one is going to let anybody that's that high leave here.
[19:02.700 --> 19:03.700]  We all have each other's backs.
[19:03.700 --> 19:04.700]  We look out for each other.
[19:04.700 --> 19:06.700]  I've never seen anybody get in our –
[19:06.700 --> 19:09.700]  And that's what's different about bars and these consumption clubs.
[19:10.700 --> 19:22.700]  I think that that's one of the points that I brought up in the testimony the other day was we may have had, what, 300 combat veterans packed into a club.
[19:22.700 --> 19:27.700]  We could not have done that in an establishment serving alcohol and had a peaceful night.
[19:27.700 --> 19:28.700]  It would not have happened.
[19:28.700 --> 19:29.700]  No.
[19:29.700 --> 19:31.700]  Yeah, it was packed.
[19:31.700 --> 19:34.700]  I have a past with alcohol, and we don't get along very well.
[19:34.700 --> 19:39.700]  So if it were at a place that served alcohol, there's way less likely of a chance that I would have gone.
[19:39.700 --> 19:42.700]  Yeah, and a lot of these guys, it's the same way.
[19:42.700 --> 19:48.700]  These veterans especially, they've self-medicated with alcohol before in their lives.
[19:48.700 --> 19:50.700]  They've self-medicated with pills.
[19:50.700 --> 19:52.700]  All these things are harmful to them.
[19:52.700 --> 19:53.700]  They hurt them.
[19:53.700 --> 19:55.700]  They hurt their families.
[19:55.700 --> 19:56.700]  They hurt their friends.
[19:56.700 --> 19:57.700]  Their liver, their kidneys.
[19:57.700 --> 19:59.700]  Yeah, they hurt their own bodies.
[19:59.700 --> 20:01.700]  But this, it doesn't.
[20:01.700 --> 20:02.700]  It brings them back into society.
[20:02.700 --> 20:09.700]  It brings them back into this community that we can sit there and help each other and take care of one another like we should.
[20:09.700 --> 20:11.700]  I like the way you put it, thanks, my friend.
[20:11.700 --> 20:13.700]  I'm glad we got to become friends and hang out.
[20:13.700 --> 20:15.700]  This guy's real good with the words here.
[20:15.700 --> 20:21.700]  I think the first time I met everybody in this group, the first time, oh, Kabuki, I met you at a cannabis cup.
[20:21.700 --> 20:24.700]  You gave me some of that delicious banana bar that you made me while I was there.
[20:24.700 --> 20:25.700]  Yeah.
[20:25.700 --> 20:26.700]  That was awesome.
[20:26.700 --> 20:31.700]  The first time I met them, Steve and I met here at the Canna Canyon, and I met you at the event last weekend.
[20:31.700 --> 20:32.700]  Yes, indeed.
[20:32.700 --> 20:35.700]  Without the social clubs, I wouldn't be making all these friends that I've got.
[20:35.700 --> 20:36.700]  Right, absolutely.
[20:36.700 --> 20:37.700]  Me neither.
[20:37.700 --> 20:39.700]  We have this little educational support group that we've got.
[20:39.700 --> 20:40.700]  This is what's so important.
[20:40.700 --> 20:46.700]  Like at my event, there was guys that haven't come out of isolation in over a year.
[20:46.700 --> 20:55.700]  They came out and medicated, and they were stacked deep, you know, 50, almost 55 people at times in that little club.
[20:55.700 --> 20:56.700]  And nobody freaked out.
[20:56.700 --> 20:57.700]  Oh.
[20:57.700 --> 20:59.700]  Everybody was under good medication.
[20:59.700 --> 21:02.700]  A couple of the PTSD guys, you could see they were ready to leave.
[21:02.700 --> 21:03.700]  Right.
[21:03.700 --> 21:04.700]  But you know what?
[21:04.700 --> 21:06.700]  You know, some of them stayed the entire night, though.
[21:06.700 --> 21:07.700]  Yeah, absolutely.
[21:07.700 --> 21:08.700]  That's great.
[21:08.700 --> 21:09.700]  They stayed the entire night.
[21:09.700 --> 21:12.700]  People that I know for a fact have severe problems with crowds.
[21:12.700 --> 21:16.700]  They were there the entire night, and they were dedicated to it.
[21:16.700 --> 21:22.700]  They loved the fact that we were having that event that so many other people around them had their back.
[21:22.700 --> 21:25.700]  They were giving out free food all night, which I thought was super awesome.
[21:25.700 --> 21:26.700]  Like all day, all night.
[21:26.700 --> 21:27.700]  You know, it's seven to seven.
[21:27.700 --> 21:29.700]  Those guys really took care of our guys.
[21:29.700 --> 21:30.700]  Yeah.
[21:30.700 --> 21:31.700]  Nobody told me it was free.
[21:31.700 --> 21:32.700]  I was like, I was hungry.
[21:32.700 --> 21:41.700]  Yeah, it was a free meatball sub or a free hot dog, and it was a free drink, you know.
[21:41.700 --> 21:42.700]  I could have gone for the drink.
[21:42.700 --> 21:43.700]  That was great.
[21:43.700 --> 21:44.700]  And chips too, Jeff.
[21:44.700 --> 21:45.700]  Okay.
[21:45.700 --> 21:48.700]  I survived.
[21:48.700 --> 21:49.700]  My vegan homie.
[21:49.700 --> 21:50.700]  That was a great event.
[21:50.700 --> 21:51.700]  There were POWs there.
[21:51.700 --> 21:55.700]  There were every type of military there, and then there were DAB kids there.
[21:55.700 --> 21:56.700]  Yeah.
[21:56.700 --> 21:59.700]  There were normal civilians there that you couldn't tell what walk of life they came from.
[21:59.700 --> 22:00.700]  Absolutely.
[22:00.700 --> 22:04.700]  What's funny is we opened up the DAB bar from five to six.
[22:04.700 --> 22:07.700]  I think we kept it open until about 6-15.
[22:07.700 --> 22:12.700]  Even the guys that came in, we're like, we always, you know, we asked them first for the DAB.
[22:12.700 --> 22:13.700]  Have you ever DABbed before?
[22:13.700 --> 22:15.700]  Do you take big DABs, little DABs?
[22:16.700 --> 22:20.700]  We were trying to be polite and make sure these guys weren't over-medicating.
[22:20.700 --> 22:23.700]  I was sending them over there all day, my bad.
[22:23.700 --> 22:26.700]  And these guys, nobody made it through over two rounds.
[22:26.700 --> 22:29.700]  I saw a couple of guys choke pretty good.
[22:29.700 --> 22:30.700]  I'm already watching them.
[22:30.700 --> 22:32.700]  Well, they're like, oh yeah, we take big DABs.
[22:32.700 --> 22:33.700]  I'm like, are you sure?
[22:33.700 --> 22:37.700]  I told Ryan from the seed company, remind me, his seed company, Pollination.
[22:37.700 --> 22:38.700]  Pollination, yes.
[22:38.700 --> 22:40.700]  That was one of our biggest donators too.
[22:40.700 --> 22:41.700]  Shout out to him.
[22:41.700 --> 22:42.700]  Thank you, Ryan.
[22:42.700 --> 22:43.700]  Shout out to Ryan from Pollination.
[22:43.700 --> 22:44.700]  He was giving out huge DABs.
[22:44.700 --> 22:45.700]  He globbed me out a couple of times.
[22:45.700 --> 22:46.700]  That was sweet.
[22:46.700 --> 22:50.700]  Do you want to take a second and list off the sponsors and the people that threw down stuff?
[22:50.700 --> 22:51.700]  They deserve a nice shout out.
[22:51.700 --> 22:52.700]  Absolutely.
[22:52.700 --> 22:53.700]  Let's see if I can go down the list.
[22:53.700 --> 22:56.700]  We got Nectar for the Gods.
[22:56.700 --> 22:57.700]  Awesome.
[22:57.700 --> 22:58.700]  Pollination, yeah.
[22:58.700 --> 23:02.700]  Nectar for the Gods, they donated like 55 cases and 25 bags of nutrients.
[23:02.700 --> 23:03.700]  So much.
[23:03.700 --> 23:04.700]  It was crazy.
[23:04.700 --> 23:05.700]  Thank you.
[23:05.700 --> 23:06.700]  Surrounded the pool table.
[23:06.700 --> 23:08.700]  Oh yeah, completely surrounded a full-size pool table.
[23:08.700 --> 23:10.700]  It was awesome to see.
[23:10.700 --> 23:11.700]  Let's see here.
[23:11.700 --> 23:12.700]  We have them.
[23:12.700 --> 23:15.700]  We have Charlemagne Extracts.
[23:15.700 --> 23:17.700]  They donated the Galaxy E-Nail.
[23:17.700 --> 23:19.700]  Pollination also donated the Mothership.
[23:19.700 --> 23:21.700]  We had Smoke and Iguana.
[23:21.700 --> 23:23.700]  They donated that flow rig.
[23:23.700 --> 23:25.700]  That thing was really nice.
[23:25.700 --> 23:26.700]  The Recycler.
[23:26.700 --> 23:27.700]  Absolutely.
[23:27.700 --> 23:28.700]  Let's see here.
[23:28.700 --> 23:32.700]  We had Rocky Mountain Seed Bank.
[23:32.700 --> 23:34.700]  We had TGA Genetics.
[23:34.700 --> 23:35.700]  We had-
[23:35.700 --> 23:36.700]  Pistol Positive.
[23:36.700 --> 23:37.700]  Pistol Positive Creations.
[23:37.700 --> 23:38.700]  Thank you.
[23:38.700 --> 23:39.700]  Boneyard.
[23:39.700 --> 23:40.700]  Yeah, Boneyard Seed.
[23:40.700 --> 23:41.700]  Sada Cali.
[23:41.700 --> 23:43.700]  We had Balushi Seeds.
[23:43.700 --> 23:46.700]  Blues Brothers Genetics.
[23:46.700 --> 23:48.700]  Wow, I didn't even see that.
[23:48.700 --> 23:49.700]  Absolutely.
[23:49.700 --> 23:50.700]  Covert Genetics.
[23:50.700 --> 23:53.700]  I think Balushi listens to the podcast.
[23:53.700 --> 23:54.700]  Scapegoat Genetics.
[23:54.700 --> 23:55.700]  Scapegoat Genetics, yep.
[23:55.700 --> 23:57.700]  Man, they donated a ton of packs too.
[23:57.700 --> 23:58.700]  Let's see.
[23:58.700 --> 23:59.700]  There was Concentrated Genetics.
[23:59.700 --> 24:05.700]  They donated a whole bunch of really interesting crosses, the Cookies and Cream, a lot of really
[24:05.700 --> 24:06.700]  neat stuff.
[24:06.700 --> 24:08.700]  Fox Genetics threw down a whole bunch of CBD packs.
[24:09.700 --> 24:12.700]  That was really nice of you.
[24:12.700 --> 24:13.700]  I don't want a pack.
[24:13.700 --> 24:14.700]  I might have walked away with a few.
[24:14.700 --> 24:18.700]  We had D's Tea.
[24:18.700 --> 24:20.700]  Yeah, D's Tea.
[24:20.700 --> 24:21.700]  Man, that tea was incredible.
[24:21.700 --> 24:25.700]  He had the CBD and the THC tea and was giving it out all day.
[24:25.700 --> 24:26.700]  Who had the cake balls?
[24:26.700 --> 24:28.700]  Oh, those ladies.
[24:28.700 --> 24:30.700]  Those were made by the Strong Alliance.
[24:30.700 --> 24:33.700]  They are a spousal support group for veterans.
[24:33.700 --> 24:35.700]  These ladies are awesome.
[24:36.700 --> 24:38.700]  They made those cake pops by hand.
[24:38.700 --> 24:40.700]  They have the best cake balls.
[24:40.700 --> 24:42.700]  I literally still have a dozen in my room.
[24:42.700 --> 24:43.700]  I'm not even going to front.
[24:43.700 --> 24:45.700]  Our friend Sierra has a small problem.
[24:45.700 --> 24:48.700]  They were fantastic.
[24:48.700 --> 24:49.700]  She's got an issue with those.
[24:49.700 --> 24:50.700]  Oh, they're delicious though.
[24:50.700 --> 24:52.700]  I can't believe I'm on my table.
[24:52.700 --> 24:53.700]  Devil's advocate, bro.
[24:53.700 --> 24:56.700]  I didn't eat one because I saw the way everybody was acting over them.
[24:56.700 --> 24:58.700]  I was like, if I eat one of those, I'm going to eat like three of them.
[24:58.700 --> 25:01.700]  Yeah, shout out to Tammy Dominguez for those.
[25:01.700 --> 25:02.700]  She hooked it up there.
[25:02.700 --> 25:03.700]  Thank you.
[25:03.700 --> 25:06.700]  We had Nate Tuesday from CB1 Analytics.
[25:06.700 --> 25:08.700]  He came out and he was collecting stuff to get tested.
[25:08.700 --> 25:10.700]  Who threw down the light?
[25:10.700 --> 25:11.700]  Somebody threw down a grow light.
[25:11.700 --> 25:12.700]  Oh, Indomax.
[25:12.700 --> 25:13.700]  Yes, that was Brad Higgins from Indomax.
[25:13.700 --> 25:14.700]  Oh, nice.
[25:14.700 --> 25:15.700]  He threw down the light.
[25:15.700 --> 25:16.700]  Yeah, thank you.
[25:16.700 --> 25:17.700]  That was awesome.
[25:17.700 --> 25:18.700]  Very nice of Brad.
[25:18.700 --> 25:19.700]  Who won the email?
[25:19.700 --> 25:20.700]  Let's give that guy a shout out.
[25:20.700 --> 25:21.700]  Do you remember his name?
[25:21.700 --> 25:22.700]  Oh, I sure don't.
[25:22.700 --> 25:23.700]  He won the mothership and the email.
[25:23.700 --> 25:26.700]  It was really cool because he came out of nowhere and seemed kind of shy.
[25:26.700 --> 25:28.700]  No offense, he was sort of a goofy dude.
[25:28.700 --> 25:30.700]  He also won the SIFS pack.
[25:30.700 --> 25:31.700]  Yeah.
[25:31.700 --> 25:32.700]  That dude killed it.
[25:32.700 --> 25:34.700]  He walked away with a lot.
[25:34.700 --> 25:35.700]  Yeah.
[25:35.700 --> 25:36.700]  Perfect.
[25:36.700 --> 25:37.700]  Which was even better.
[25:37.700 --> 25:39.700]  You could tell he wanted to buddy up with somebody.
[25:39.700 --> 25:41.700]  He just didn't know who to buddy up with at the event,
[25:41.700 --> 25:43.700]  and he bumped into Steven and made friends.
[25:43.700 --> 25:46.700]  He'll take anybody in as a friend because you're a cool guy.
[25:46.700 --> 25:48.700]  I think he might have been a veteran.
[25:48.700 --> 25:49.700]  He was.
[25:49.700 --> 25:51.700]  He bonded right away and made buddies, and then he won.
[25:51.700 --> 25:53.700]  It was really great to see that guy win.
[25:53.700 --> 25:55.700]  Colorado Dry Sift.
[25:55.700 --> 25:56.700]  Oh, got the screens.
[25:56.700 --> 25:58.700]  I got a set of screens myself.
[25:58.700 --> 26:00.700]  He actually gave away six screens.
[26:00.700 --> 26:01.700]  He gave away six screens.
[26:01.700 --> 26:02.700]  That was great.
[26:02.700 --> 26:03.700]  Who was the guy next to your booth?
[26:03.700 --> 26:04.700]  That was DST.
[26:04.700 --> 26:05.700]  Okay.
[26:05.700 --> 26:06.700]  Yeah.
[26:06.700 --> 26:09.700]  I think it was pretty much done by the time you got there,
[26:09.700 --> 26:10.700]  Mitt Vann.
[26:10.700 --> 26:12.700]  I was bugging him all day for CBDT.
[26:12.700 --> 26:13.700]  That was a huge event.
[26:13.700 --> 26:14.700]  That's a lot of sponsors.
[26:14.700 --> 26:15.700]  You got more?
[26:15.700 --> 26:16.700]  Let's see here.
[26:16.700 --> 26:17.700]  I feel like.
[26:17.700 --> 26:18.700]  We had 16, 20 unofficials.
[26:18.700 --> 26:19.700]  They donated 450 hash caps.
[26:19.700 --> 26:20.700]  Yeah.
[26:20.700 --> 26:21.700]  They gave me a bunch.
[26:21.700 --> 26:24.700]  Probably like an ounce and a half, two ounces worth of cannabis.
[26:24.700 --> 26:27.700]  Who grew all the weed that you were donating to people?
[26:27.700 --> 26:28.700]  So that was.
[26:28.700 --> 26:29.700]  Let's see here.
[26:29.700 --> 26:31.700]  Oh, now you're putting me on the spot.
[26:31.700 --> 26:33.700]  I got some Michael Lea plot before.
[26:33.700 --> 26:34.700]  Oh, yeah.
[26:34.700 --> 26:37.700]  He gave away the Kim dog and the gorilla glue for.
[26:37.700 --> 26:42.700]  He gave me like an ounce and a half of Harlequin.
[26:42.700 --> 26:44.700]  And then me, you know, my, my.
[26:44.700 --> 26:45.700]  I left that Harlequin.
[26:45.700 --> 26:46.700]  Yeah.
[26:46.700 --> 26:51.700]  I gave away about an ounce of my New York city diesel.
[26:51.700 --> 26:53.700]  I want to play some Sherbert.
[26:53.700 --> 26:55.700]  I gave away some grateful dog.
[26:56.700 --> 27:00.700]  We rolled up probably half an ounce and joints gave those out.
[27:00.700 --> 27:03.700]  And that was just a mix between all my strains that, you know,
[27:03.700 --> 27:05.700]  I usually carry around with me.
[27:05.700 --> 27:07.700]  And I got there and you walked up and didn't have time to talk.
[27:07.700 --> 27:09.700]  You're like, Hey man, good to see you.
[27:09.700 --> 27:10.700]  Want to join?
[27:10.700 --> 27:12.700]  I was busy, man.
[27:12.700 --> 27:13.700]  I can do that.
[27:13.700 --> 27:15.700]  I mean, there were so many people I wanted to talk to that.
[27:15.700 --> 27:16.700]  Yeah.
[27:16.700 --> 27:17.700]  I wanted to get you on the show that day,
[27:17.700 --> 27:19.700]  but I could see it in your eye that you were pretty much done by the
[27:19.700 --> 27:20.700]  time the event was over.
[27:20.700 --> 27:21.700]  Oh yeah.
[27:21.700 --> 27:22.700]  I was, I was, I was spent.
[27:22.700 --> 27:23.700]  I mean, that was crazy.
[27:23.700 --> 27:24.700]  That was the first event I've ever done.
[27:24.700 --> 27:27.700]  And I mean, it went down pretty smooth.
[27:27.700 --> 27:29.700]  I had, I did have a veteran that was,
[27:29.700 --> 27:33.700]  was upset the way it was going down and I had him come back and I talked
[27:33.700 --> 27:37.700]  to him and, you know, he, he, he brought up a good point on some things.
[27:37.700 --> 27:41.700]  And so I hooked him up with a case nutrients and was it like five or
[27:41.700 --> 27:42.700]  seven packs of genetics?
[27:42.700 --> 27:43.700]  Oh yeah.
[27:43.700 --> 27:44.700]  Soil and a couple of joints.
[27:44.700 --> 27:47.700]  He left happy.
[27:47.700 --> 27:48.700]  Yeah.
[27:48.700 --> 27:49.700]  He left very happy.
[27:49.700 --> 27:50.700]  And that's the thing, man.
[27:50.700 --> 27:52.700]  Like my, my organization,
[27:52.700 --> 27:55.700]  I don't charge any membership fees to these veterans.
[27:55.700 --> 27:56.700]  It's free.
[27:56.700 --> 27:57.700]  They've already paid enough.
[27:57.700 --> 27:59.700]  These guys shouldn't have to pay a penny out of their pocket.
[27:59.700 --> 28:02.700]  So if somebody is a veteran in the Colorado Springs area,
[28:02.700 --> 28:06.700]  a cannabis user and needs some help, how can they get in touch with you?
[28:06.700 --> 28:10.700]  They can get in touch with me at the veteran farmers alliance at gmail.com.
[28:10.700 --> 28:11.700]  You hear that?
[28:11.700 --> 28:12.700]  You guys get in touch.
[28:12.700 --> 28:13.700]  Steven will help you out.
[28:13.700 --> 28:14.700]  We'll help you out.
[28:14.700 --> 28:16.700]  The veteran farmers alliance.
[28:16.700 --> 28:17.700]  We'll take good care of you.
[28:17.700 --> 28:18.700]  We'll invite you to our next event.
[28:18.700 --> 28:20.700]  You can hang out the next event.
[28:20.700 --> 28:21.700]  I said our, like I'm.
[28:21.700 --> 28:23.700]  You'll probably be there.
[28:23.700 --> 28:24.700]  You're always welcome.
[28:24.700 --> 28:25.700]  Always.
[28:25.700 --> 28:27.700]  You know, and you know, here's another thing.
[28:27.700 --> 28:29.700]  The veteran farmers lines just doesn't stop there.
[28:29.700 --> 28:30.700]  You know,
[28:30.700 --> 28:34.700]  it takes organizations that are out there and brings them all together in
[28:34.700 --> 28:35.700]  one place.
[28:35.700 --> 28:38.700]  So veterans have an access to, you know, to care.
[28:38.700 --> 28:41.700]  They, they can reach out to each organization that has these specialties
[28:41.700 --> 28:44.700]  and use that, you know, whatever pertains to them,
[28:44.700 --> 28:47.700]  whatever matches up with that organization and them, they use that.
[28:47.700 --> 28:49.700]  And then once they're done,
[28:49.700 --> 28:51.700]  they can come see the other organization or they can use all of them.
[28:51.700 --> 28:54.700]  Now they have this central network hub of actual, you know,
[28:54.700 --> 28:56.700]  they can go to outreach functions.
[28:56.700 --> 28:58.700]  They can go to different events.
[28:58.700 --> 28:59.700]  They can go hiking.
[28:59.700 --> 29:03.700]  They go fishing and that's, that's bringing these organizations.
[29:03.700 --> 29:06.700]  This is, you know, this, this alternate therapy, you know,
[29:06.700 --> 29:10.700]  is just another way of helping these guys heal and being able to offer
[29:10.700 --> 29:13.700]  them that that's like, nobody's ever been able to do that.
[29:13.700 --> 29:16.700]  Everybody wants to make things a competition, but yet we're trying to save
[29:16.700 --> 29:17.700]  lives.
[29:17.700 --> 29:22.700]  We just need to all come together and stop the BS and just say, Hey,
[29:22.700 --> 29:24.700]  we're going to take care of these guys. You know what?
[29:24.700 --> 29:27.700]  I can't take care of them, but you can, you take them when you're done with
[29:27.700 --> 29:29.700]  them. I'll take care of them. When I'm done with them,
[29:29.700 --> 29:31.700]  you go to that next organization. It's no competition.
[29:31.700 --> 29:32.700]  We're here to save lives.
[29:32.700 --> 29:36.700]  Let's drop this piddly bullshit and let's start doing what we need to do.
[29:36.700 --> 29:38.700]  Veterans unite pretty much.
[29:38.700 --> 29:41.700]  There you go. And the community, that's the most important part.
[29:41.700 --> 29:42.700]  Exactly.
[29:42.700 --> 29:46.700]  People need to see that the community and veterans can, you know,
[29:46.700 --> 29:50.700]  come together and they can integrate together and they can socialize and
[29:50.700 --> 29:53.700]  there's no drama. You know, you can't do that in a bar.
[29:54.700 --> 29:56.700]  Somebody says the wrong thing. You know,
[29:56.700 --> 29:59.700]  somebody's drug move for PTSD or this or that. Oh man, you got to,
[30:00.700 --> 30:02.700]  you're somebody's going to get something in the face. Yeah. You know,
[30:02.700 --> 30:07.700]  and, but you go to a cannabis club and people are able to sit back, relax,
[30:08.700 --> 30:09.700]  get some education, you know,
[30:09.700 --> 30:12.700]  throw some knowledge to these guys and, and,
[30:12.700 --> 30:16.700]  and, and maybe show these guys what's really up with, with cannabis.
[30:16.700 --> 30:18.700]  I mean, some people go in there, they're scared.
[30:18.700 --> 30:20.700]  They don't know what's going on. Right. You know,
[30:22.700 --> 30:25.700]  I think a lot of the clubs in town offer free entry for veterans.
[30:25.700 --> 30:30.700]  I know that we do the lazy lion. Um, does the dab lounge?
[30:30.700 --> 30:33.700]  Yes. The dab lounge. Um,
[30:33.700 --> 30:36.700]  so if there's veterans that are out there that are maybe, um,
[30:37.700 --> 30:41.700]  intimidated or, uh, nervous, we're very accepting, very,
[30:41.700 --> 30:45.700]  very accepting, very, um, welcoming to definitely veterans.
[30:45.700 --> 30:47.700]  We definitely appreciate all of your service.
[30:48.700 --> 30:52.700]  This is another thing you mentioned PTSD and the, and you know,
[30:52.700 --> 30:56.700]  veterans are, are, are the public face of it right now, but, uh,
[30:56.700 --> 31:00.700]  we know that we are really a tiny portion of the people in society that
[31:01.700 --> 31:05.700]  actually have PTSD. The vast majority are actually women. And, uh,
[31:05.700 --> 31:09.700]  we may be fighting a fight for our rights right now with PTSD,
[31:09.700 --> 31:14.700]  but we know that we're still fighting for the people who are way too
[31:14.700 --> 31:19.700]  hurt, too scared, too angry, too ashamed, too afraid, uh,
[31:19.700 --> 31:22.700]  locked up in their home somewhere. We're fighting for them too,
[31:23.700 --> 31:28.700]  in order for their rights to be recognized as well as ours. Absolutely.
[31:28.700 --> 31:32.700]  If you guys are intimidated to come to a social smoke lounge, uh,
[31:33.700 --> 31:37.700]  the Cana Canyon has classy leather couches. They are comfortable.
[31:37.700 --> 31:42.700]  The walls are clean, soft, stylish, hardwood floors. We did, we did. Yeah.
[31:42.700 --> 31:44.700]  Kabuki and I met here for the first time.
[31:44.700 --> 31:46.700]  I pointed out that Kabuki and Steven met here. That's pretty. Yeah.
[31:46.700 --> 31:49.700]  To see that's what it's all about. Yeah. Community building community here.
[31:50.700 --> 31:53.700]  And the place is classy. You guys, it's clean. It's got a super clean,
[31:53.700 --> 31:56.700]  handicap accessible restroom. It's a great place. So don't be afraid to come.
[31:56.700 --> 31:59.700]  Check it out. It's not a, it's not like a bar. It's well lit.
[31:59.700 --> 32:03.700]  The music's not too loud. We can con conversate. We can have conversation.
[32:03.700 --> 32:05.700]  Camille says it's real. It's real. Let's go with it.
[32:05.700 --> 32:07.700]  Conversate in here. Yeah. Let's get it together.
[32:07.700 --> 32:10.700]  We're at the dictionary hashtag classiest. Fuck. I like this place.
[32:10.700 --> 32:13.700]  So don't be shy. Come hang out. I don't feel like if you're new at smoking,
[32:13.700 --> 32:16.700]  if you, if you're not a dab kid, if you're not into the whole scene,
[32:16.700 --> 32:18.700]  we'll help you out. I'll give you your first stab. I won't make you choke.
[32:18.700 --> 32:22.700]  I'll help you out. We'll teach you how to use the rig. Absolutely.
[32:22.700 --> 32:25.700]  Why'd you get you? Yeah. There are bottles of water on the shelf over here.
[32:25.700 --> 32:27.700]  You'll be well taken care of. Don't be afraid.
[32:27.700 --> 32:29.700]  We'll give you a little bit of a break. We'll be back in a minute.
[32:29.700 --> 32:31.700]  Yeah. We get their bottles of water on the shelf over here.
[32:31.700 --> 32:35.700]  You'll be well taken care of. Don't be afraid. And other than that,
[32:35.700 --> 32:38.700]  there's no legal place for people to congregate and consume.
[32:38.700 --> 32:40.700]  So if you want to go somewhere and smoke,
[32:40.700 --> 32:43.700]  other than hanging out in the car behind some building or something,
[32:43.700 --> 32:47.700]  or being out somewhere in public, which we're technically legally not allowed to do.
[32:47.700 --> 32:50.700]  And, you know, to be respectful of others, you know,
[32:50.700 --> 32:55.700]  I don't feel the need for others to smell my medicine and that's just me being considerate.
[32:55.700 --> 32:59.700]  But I also, as a patient and as someone who's over the age of 21,
[32:59.700 --> 33:04.700]  recreationally don't have a lot of safe places to go, you know,
[33:04.700 --> 33:11.700]  and not everyone works in the industry or has made their lifestyle around everything that we do.
[33:11.700 --> 33:18.700]  So in those moments where a patient or a normal or occasional recreational user
[33:18.700 --> 33:21.700]  might want a safe place to enjoy cannabis,
[33:21.700 --> 33:24.700]  what are we going to do if these places aren't around?
[33:24.700 --> 33:26.700]  Got to go do something shady.
[33:26.700 --> 33:31.700]  The fact is, is that if they pass laws banning these types of establishments,
[33:31.700 --> 33:33.700]  they're going to push people out into their public spaces.
[33:33.700 --> 33:36.700]  And who wants to smell weed wherever they go?
[33:36.700 --> 33:38.700]  Nobody wants to smell weed wherever they go.
[33:38.700 --> 33:41.700]  Well, everyone, you know, most people.
[33:41.700 --> 33:43.700]  We're a special breed.
[33:43.700 --> 33:47.700]  Exactly. But I mean, there's a large majority of people out there
[33:47.700 --> 33:50.700]  who probably aren't going to want to smell weed in the public parks.
[33:50.700 --> 33:56.700]  Why do you give people bars so they won't sit on a public park bench drinking somewhere?
[33:56.700 --> 33:59.700]  Such a great point. I'm a cannabis consumer. I'm a breeder.
[33:59.700 --> 34:01.700]  I'm all about the cannabis life.
[34:01.700 --> 34:04.700]  But I do have a daughter that I don't hide her from cannabis.
[34:04.700 --> 34:07.700]  I don't hide cannabis from her. She knows what cannabis is.
[34:07.700 --> 34:09.700]  She is not attracted to the smell of it at all.
[34:09.700 --> 34:13.700]  But I don't think that anybody should have to be at the park with their child
[34:13.700 --> 34:15.700]  and explain what those guys over there are doing.
[34:15.700 --> 34:16.700]  Yeah.
[34:16.700 --> 34:18.700]  That's not to be a place to be.
[34:18.700 --> 34:21.700]  It shouldn't be your fault. I have to talk with my daughter about that today.
[34:21.700 --> 34:23.700]  It shouldn't be anybody's fault.
[34:23.700 --> 34:25.700]  I should decide when that conversation happens.
[34:25.700 --> 34:26.700]  No, absolutely.
[34:26.700 --> 34:28.700]  Keep that in mind, you guys. Don't go dabbing at the park.
[34:28.700 --> 34:30.700]  Don't be those guys.
[34:30.700 --> 34:31.700]  Right.
[34:31.700 --> 34:33.700]  Everyone just looks at me like, no.
[34:33.700 --> 34:36.700]  No, no. I completely agree.
[34:36.700 --> 34:39.700]  I have a daughter. I very much feel the same way, you know?
[34:39.700 --> 34:42.700]  Right. You know, it's funny. I was sitting in city council meeting
[34:42.700 --> 34:45.700]  and I looked up, I was like, how many liquor stores are there in Colorado Springs?
[34:45.700 --> 34:47.700]  And I was like, hmm, 104.
[34:47.700 --> 34:51.700]  I said, how many bars are there in Colorado Springs?
[34:51.700 --> 34:52.700]  188.
[34:52.700 --> 34:53.700]  Wow.
[34:53.700 --> 34:57.700]  But 15 cannabis clubs. Oh, everybody loses their shit.
[34:57.700 --> 34:59.700]  I mean, what? Come on, guys.
[34:59.700 --> 35:01.700]  It's kind of like when they did the whole caregiver act.
[35:01.700 --> 35:05.700]  It's not even 1% of the people that grow in Colorado are caregivers.
[35:05.700 --> 35:07.700]  Did they sneak something in at that city council meeting?
[35:07.700 --> 35:08.700]  Yeah.
[35:08.700 --> 35:09.700]  And they didn't even talk about it.
[35:09.700 --> 35:10.700]  That pissed me off.
[35:10.700 --> 35:12.700]  Oh, boy. I got a finger in your shoe.
[35:12.700 --> 35:16.700]  In my district, the residential plan counts as 12 plants.
[35:16.700 --> 35:17.700]  12s.
[35:17.700 --> 35:23.700]  Yeah. So, huge problem with that in the fact that I have a large concentration
[35:23.700 --> 35:27.700]  of pediatric patients here that they're not even epileptic for the most part.
[35:27.700 --> 35:29.700]  They're cancer patients.
[35:29.700 --> 35:34.700]  They rely on a heavy supply of THC-heavy material.
[35:34.700 --> 35:40.700]  And 12 plants sometimes doesn't even cut 60 days of medicine for them,
[35:40.700 --> 35:42.700]  depending on what they're working with.
[35:42.700 --> 35:46.700]  Most of these guys are not commercial growers.
[35:46.700 --> 35:51.700]  They're modestly growing organically and getting decent yields.
[35:51.700 --> 35:57.700]  But these parents can do a lot better with more decent numbers,
[35:57.700 --> 36:03.700]  but restricting it to 12, I feel is just going to cause caregivers a lot more headaches.
[36:03.700 --> 36:07.700]  It's going to cause parents who are trying to grow themselves because they can't
[36:07.700 --> 36:11.700]  go to dispensaries to get what they need because they might not have it,
[36:11.700 --> 36:13.700]  or whatever the case is.
[36:14.700 --> 36:19.700]  I just feel that it's unfair and very...
[36:20.700 --> 36:21.700]  It's unjust.
[36:21.700 --> 36:22.700]  Yeah.
[36:22.700 --> 36:25.700]  I was just about to say it seems like time and time again it kind of feels like
[36:25.700 --> 36:27.700]  we're not getting what we voted for.
[36:27.700 --> 36:29.700]  Yeah, absolutely.
[36:29.700 --> 36:35.700]  I feel like they're pushing the medical market away and forcing everybody to go shop at the dispensary.
[36:35.700 --> 36:38.700]  They want some of the caregivers and they want all of the tax money.
[36:38.700 --> 36:39.700]  They do.
[36:39.700 --> 36:41.700]  They're actively pushing for that.
[36:41.700 --> 36:47.700]  And there are senators who are trying to take away home grow as we speak.
[36:47.700 --> 36:52.700]  This year, actually, I saw some language off of...
[36:52.700 --> 36:54.700]  I'm going to go ahead and call her out.
[36:54.700 --> 37:02.700]  Senator Conte, her desk, that wanted to limit all caregivers and patients in the state
[37:02.700 --> 37:04.700]  to six plants maximum.
[37:04.700 --> 37:10.700]  And this would not only affect individuals, but it would affect structures.
[37:10.700 --> 37:16.700]  So that an apartment complex would have a maximum of six plants in that apartment complex.
[37:16.700 --> 37:19.700]  So if Kabuki and I lived in the same apartment building, we're fighting over plants.
[37:19.700 --> 37:20.700]  Yeah.
[37:20.700 --> 37:21.700]  Exactly.
[37:21.700 --> 37:22.700]  You're then committing a felony.
[37:22.700 --> 37:24.700]  Both of us are committing a felony.
[37:24.700 --> 37:25.700]  Yes.
[37:25.700 --> 37:26.700]  We don't even know about each other.
[37:26.700 --> 37:30.700]  So thankfully we managed to get that language removed from that bill.
[37:31.700 --> 37:37.700]  But there are a lot of issues like this that are coming up that are coming from the industry.
[37:37.700 --> 37:45.700]  They're being actively lobbied for by recreational and some medical facilities too.
[37:45.700 --> 37:52.700]  Ones that are joint medical rec, but they're trying to eliminate medical rights and push everybody into the recreational market.
[37:52.700 --> 37:58.700]  And a lot of those dispensary owners have issues with clubs like this because they think that it's going to ruin their business.
[37:58.700 --> 37:59.700]  Has it yet?
[37:59.700 --> 38:00.700]  No.
[38:00.700 --> 38:02.700]  Not that we've noticed.
[38:02.700 --> 38:03.700]  It's still growing.
[38:03.700 --> 38:04.700]  Yeah.
[38:04.700 --> 38:05.700]  Our shop is still open.
[38:05.700 --> 38:06.700]  This place is still open.
[38:06.700 --> 38:13.700]  And every one of the business owners that I know, they are all happy for wanting regulation.
[38:13.700 --> 38:15.700]  They're all for licensing.
[38:15.700 --> 38:23.700]  None of these people that I know that run these clubs have an alter motive to take money from any establishment,
[38:24.700 --> 38:28.700]  but to provide a service for people that is genuinely needed.
[38:28.700 --> 38:30.700]  And that's my honest two cents.
[38:30.700 --> 38:32.700]  I don't work for any of these clubs.
[38:32.700 --> 38:35.700]  I visit them from time to time.
[38:35.700 --> 38:37.700]  And that's just honestly how I feel.
[38:37.700 --> 38:39.700]  You're here every time I'm here, bro.
[38:39.700 --> 38:43.700]  Half the time I show up, I don't mention I'm coming and you're here.
[38:43.700 --> 38:44.700]  Hey, man.
[38:44.700 --> 38:45.700]  What can I say?
[38:45.700 --> 38:46.700]  Great.
[38:46.700 --> 38:48.700]  Kamille, you look like you've got something you want to say.
[38:48.700 --> 38:49.700]  I did and I forgot.
[38:49.700 --> 38:50.700]  Shit, I'm sorry, Kamille.
[38:50.700 --> 38:51.700]  Stoner.
[38:51.700 --> 38:52.700]  It's okay.
[38:52.700 --> 38:53.700]  It's okay, Dad.
[38:53.700 --> 38:54.700]  It'll come back to you.
[38:54.700 --> 38:55.700]  Yeah, fair enough.
[38:55.700 --> 38:57.700]  There's some Black Cherry Chem Live resin on the table.
[38:57.700 --> 38:59.700]  Which, by the way, tastes fantastic.
[38:59.700 --> 39:00.700]  Thank you.
[39:00.700 --> 39:01.700]  Thank you.
[39:01.700 --> 39:02.700]  Oh, it's tasty.
[39:02.700 --> 39:03.700]  I bred it.
[39:03.700 --> 39:05.700]  We grew it over at the Green and Healthy Garden, and then our friends at Turpex blasted that.
[39:05.700 --> 39:06.700]  So shout out to the whole crew there.
[39:06.700 --> 39:07.700]  Yeah, that was so delicious.
[39:07.700 --> 39:08.700]  That's called synergy.
[39:08.700 --> 39:09.700]  Synergy.
[39:09.700 --> 39:10.700]  I like it.
[39:10.700 --> 39:13.700]  You've got a lot to say about the 12-plant limit, don't you?
[39:13.700 --> 39:14.700]  I do.
[39:14.700 --> 39:15.700]  Let's hear it, Steve.
[39:15.700 --> 39:16.700]  I am very upset over this.
[39:17.700 --> 39:21.700]  I'm basically allergic to every single prescription pill out there.
[39:21.700 --> 39:22.700]  Of course.
[39:22.700 --> 39:25.700]  The one I'm not allergic to, at least that's what my kidneys do.
[39:25.700 --> 39:27.700]  A lot of the listeners might not be familiar.
[39:27.700 --> 39:30.700]  Will you tell us a little bit briefly about your injury?
[39:30.700 --> 39:39.700]  Okay, so on April 11th of 2008, I was doing route clearance as a combat engineer in Sadr City.
[39:39.700 --> 39:40.700]  And I was hit by...
[39:40.700 --> 39:42.700]  Be more specific with Sadr City.
[39:42.700 --> 39:43.700]  It's in Iraq.
[39:43.700 --> 39:44.700]  Okay, a lot of our listeners will know that.
[39:44.700 --> 39:45.700]  Right, right, yeah.
[39:45.700 --> 39:46.700]  Not Colorado.
[39:46.700 --> 39:47.700]  Not Colorado.
[39:47.700 --> 39:50.700]  Let's specify that right now.
[39:50.700 --> 39:56.700]  We were ambushed, and the fifth IED that went off blew a 13-inch hole into my vehicle
[39:56.700 --> 40:03.700]  and blew a 5-inch hole into my back, causing my hip to be shattered, my pelvis to be broken,
[40:03.700 --> 40:08.700]  and my spine to be shifted forward, causing me to have a little bit of spinal injury.
[40:09.700 --> 40:16.700]  I had over 200 pieces of shrapnel in me, and it took about three and a half months for the wound to close up.
[40:16.700 --> 40:17.700]  Very lucky to be alive.
[40:17.700 --> 40:18.700]  Absolutely.
[40:18.700 --> 40:19.700]  Well, thanks for pulling through.
[40:19.700 --> 40:20.700]  Thank you.
[40:20.700 --> 40:21.700]  I'm very happy to be here.
[40:21.700 --> 40:22.700]  Thanks, Steve.
[40:22.700 --> 40:23.700]  Thanks, Steve.
[40:23.700 --> 40:24.700]  For real, thanks, Steve.
[40:24.700 --> 40:28.700]  I've seen the hole in your back, and for the listeners, it looks like if you took a normal dude's back...
[40:28.700 --> 40:29.700]  Excuse me if I'm...
[40:29.700 --> 40:30.700]  No, you're good.
[40:30.700 --> 40:31.700]  Go ahead.
[40:31.700 --> 40:32.700]  I'm a big dude.
[40:32.700 --> 40:34.700]  I could put my fist in the hole.
[40:34.700 --> 40:36.700]  That's exactly how I describe it.
[40:36.700 --> 40:39.700]  You could, like, to fill the hole with putty, would take your fist.
[40:39.700 --> 40:40.700]  Yeah, absolutely.
[40:40.700 --> 40:41.700]  It's insane.
[40:41.700 --> 40:42.700]  It's tremendous.
[40:42.700 --> 40:47.700]  My wife, she jokes, she's like, all we need to do is slap a little Bondo on it, let it stick, and paint that shit.
[40:47.700 --> 40:48.700]  It'll be good, right?
[40:48.700 --> 40:49.700]  You know?
[40:49.700 --> 40:50.700]  Some spackle.
[40:50.700 --> 40:51.700]  All right.
[40:51.700 --> 40:52.700]  All right, continuing, right?
[40:52.700 --> 40:57.700]  But, you know, the whole 12-plant count thing, like, I mean, I consume so much.
[40:57.700 --> 41:03.700]  I ingest, I smoke, I dab, I use topicals.
[41:03.700 --> 41:09.700]  You know, for them to cut me down to 12 when I have a 65-plant count is asinine.
[41:09.700 --> 41:12.700]  It's just, they're not doctors.
[41:12.700 --> 41:15.700]  There's no way for them to judge who needs what.
[41:15.700 --> 41:18.700]  I mean, the standard whatever, they're not medical doctors.
[41:18.700 --> 41:32.700]  I spent three hours with my medical doctor going over my plant program, failure rates, pesticide rates, clune failure rates, you know, successful harvest, you know, like, fan failures, light failures.
[41:33.700 --> 41:39.700]  And, you know, you go over that, and then we're like, okay, we have finished product, this is what's usable, this isn't usable.
[41:39.700 --> 41:54.700]  And then for city council to have no training in the medical field, to not even understand what a plant count means to somebody, to not even understand what, you know, what level of a grower they're at, you know, is just, it's unforgivable.
[41:54.700 --> 41:56.700]  It's just an insult.
[41:56.700 --> 41:58.700]  And I'm not going to abide by it.
[41:58.700 --> 41:59.700]  I won't.
[42:00.700 --> 42:02.700]  Because I paid for that extended plant count.
[42:02.700 --> 42:07.700]  I have proven every right why I need that plant count, and they are not going to take that away from me.
[42:07.700 --> 42:08.700]  It should stand up in court.
[42:08.700 --> 42:09.700]  Oh, absolutely.
[42:09.700 --> 42:10.700]  And I will be filing a lawsuit.
[42:10.700 --> 42:13.700]  You're going to file a lawsuit against the city of Colorado Springs?
[42:13.700 --> 42:14.700]  Yes, sir.
[42:14.700 --> 42:15.700]  Will your lawyer come to court with you?
[42:15.700 --> 42:16.700]  We're going to find out.
[42:16.700 --> 42:18.700]  Or your doctor, I know your lawyer, will your doctor show up?
[42:18.700 --> 42:19.700]  Absolutely.
[42:19.700 --> 42:20.700]  Good.
[42:20.700 --> 42:26.700]  Because I have over 6,000 pages of medical documents that can prove to them that in every single manner they are wrong.
[42:26.700 --> 42:29.700]  You've got better SOPs than some dispensaries I've gone to.
[42:32.700 --> 42:38.700]  Your notation and note taking and your planning is better than some major grows in this state, bro.
[42:38.700 --> 42:39.700]  I just, well, I appreciate it, man.
[42:39.700 --> 42:41.700]  I just, I take this seriously.
[42:41.700 --> 42:42.700]  This is my medicine.
[42:42.700 --> 42:43.700]  This is what keeps me alive.
[42:43.700 --> 42:45.700]  Can people follow you on Instagram?
[42:45.700 --> 42:46.700]  Do you want to give out your...
[42:46.700 --> 42:47.700]  Absolutely, yes.
[42:47.700 --> 42:49.700]  My Instagram name is triceratops.
[42:49.700 --> 42:51.700]  He's got some great pictures of Grateful Dog up there.
[42:51.700 --> 42:52.700]  He does.
[42:52.700 --> 42:53.700]  I love that fan.
[42:53.700 --> 42:54.700]  Go check him out, triceratops, on Instagram.
[42:54.700 --> 42:55.700]  He's got a hell of a great grow.
[42:55.700 --> 42:56.700]  Absolutely one of my favorite strains.
[42:56.700 --> 42:57.700]  Well, thank you.
[42:57.700 --> 42:58.700]  Thank you.
[42:58.700 --> 42:59.700]  I appreciate that.
[42:59.700 --> 43:00.700]  You do a great job with that one.
[43:00.700 --> 43:01.700]  Well, thank you very much.
[43:01.700 --> 43:04.700]  Yeah, I would not have met these guys if it weren't for a club, so I'm very grateful right now for being here.
[43:04.700 --> 43:05.700]  Yeah, absolutely.
[43:05.700 --> 43:06.700]  This is what it's all about.
[43:06.700 --> 43:08.700]  I mean, there's nothing crazy going on.
[43:08.700 --> 43:09.700]  Nobody's slamming into walls.
[43:09.700 --> 43:10.700]  Nobody's arguing or fighting.
[43:10.700 --> 43:12.700]  There's no drama.
[43:12.700 --> 43:15.700]  I've got a question for Camille, but she just took a big old dab, so I'm going to give her half a second.
[43:15.700 --> 43:16.700]  You good?
[43:16.700 --> 43:17.700]  You ready?
[43:17.700 --> 43:18.700]  All right.
[43:18.700 --> 43:19.700]  All right.
[43:19.700 --> 43:21.700]  Have you ever had anybody act up or try to fight in here?
[43:21.700 --> 43:22.700]  Fight?
[43:22.700 --> 43:23.700]  Yeah.
[43:23.700 --> 43:24.700]  No.
[43:24.700 --> 43:25.700]  I don't know how to fight in here.
[43:25.700 --> 43:26.700]  No.
[43:26.700 --> 43:30.700]  So the craziest thing that happened was we like to keep a certain atmosphere for our members.
[43:30.700 --> 43:32.700]  It's very important to us.
[43:32.700 --> 43:37.700]  So occasionally we'll have a member come in who is intoxicated.
[43:37.700 --> 43:47.700]  And in that moment, you know, we try and scooch him out as fast as possible, but occasionally they will get into the main lounge just by people exiting.
[43:48.700 --> 43:54.700]  So there's been one instance where we had to escort someone off the premises, but it was fairly easy.
[43:54.700 --> 43:59.700]  They went kind of willingly, so that helped.
[43:59.700 --> 44:03.700]  And they were drunk too, so no.
[44:03.700 --> 44:05.700]  We just had to deal with a couple drunk people.
[44:05.700 --> 44:07.700]  That completely proved my point.
[44:07.700 --> 44:12.700]  The only problems at the cannabis social lounge were the drunk people that showed up.
[44:12.700 --> 44:21.700]  The thing that I can really appreciate too is more than once we've had members kind of bring something that someone has left up to the counter.
[44:21.700 --> 44:25.700]  Kabuki is notorious for leaving stuff here.
[44:25.700 --> 44:26.700]  Yes.
[44:26.700 --> 44:27.700]  So…
[44:27.700 --> 44:30.700]  You leave your rig here, your carb cap here, whatever.
[44:30.700 --> 44:35.700]  I left my wallet on the counter here earlier and it was promptly returned to me.
[44:35.700 --> 44:36.700]  It was…
[44:36.700 --> 44:37.700]  Yeah, another…
[44:37.700 --> 44:38.700]  Yeah.
[44:38.700 --> 44:39.700]  Do you call them members?
[44:39.700 --> 44:40.700]  Members, yeah.
[44:40.700 --> 44:41.700]  Another member shouted, whose wallet?
[44:41.700 --> 44:44.700]  Yeah, this is a place where people look out for each other.
[44:44.700 --> 44:45.700]  This is a safe location.
[44:45.700 --> 44:46.700]  Keys, wallet, phone, jacket.
[44:46.700 --> 44:49.700]  I got it all backwards and say pee pee.
[44:49.700 --> 44:55.700]  The city council meeting, they said it wasn't safe, but these are safe places.
[44:55.700 --> 44:56.700]  No, absolutely.
[44:56.700 --> 44:59.700]  They sounded so uneducated at that meeting.
[44:59.700 --> 45:01.700]  Yeah, there's nothing going to happen here.
[45:01.700 --> 45:05.700]  Unless city council comes and causes a problem.
[45:05.700 --> 45:07.700]  What's really frustrating is…
[45:07.700 --> 45:08.700]  All of it.
[45:09.700 --> 45:10.700]  Matt was talking…
[45:10.700 --> 45:12.700]  Is it okay if I call you Matt or do you prefer Matthew?
[45:12.700 --> 45:13.700]  Yeah, go right ahead.
[45:13.700 --> 45:14.700]  Okay.
[45:14.700 --> 45:16.700]  Matt was talking about Kit Roupe and…
[45:16.700 --> 45:18.700]  Kit Roupe and…
[45:18.700 --> 45:20.700]  Is that how you pronounce it?
[45:20.700 --> 45:22.700]  Yeah, Senator Kit Roupe.
[45:22.700 --> 45:24.700]  Yeah, I'm messing his name all up.
[45:24.700 --> 45:25.700]  Sorry, man.
[45:25.700 --> 45:26.700]  It's a weird name.
[45:26.700 --> 45:27.700]  It happens.
[45:27.700 --> 45:28.700]  It's a weird name.
[45:28.700 --> 45:37.700]  So, they've been working on this license for the clubs and they came out and said nothing
[45:37.700 --> 45:38.700]  is made in a vacuum.
[45:38.700 --> 45:40.700]  And that's very true.
[45:40.700 --> 45:45.700]  And what's frustrating is it feels like city council does not have that mentality at all.
[45:45.700 --> 45:53.700]  They can't seem to grasp or understand a few different sides, whether it be veterans, people
[45:53.700 --> 45:58.700]  who consume on a recreational level, or even just business owners.
[45:58.700 --> 46:02.700]  They just don't seem to want to listen to what we have to say.
[46:03.700 --> 46:08.700]  But, yeah, Kit Roupe and Jonathan Singer are doing some really awesome progressive stuff
[46:08.700 --> 46:15.700]  with the licensing and trying to make these clubs here to stay, which I can appreciate.
[46:15.700 --> 46:18.700]  But Colorado Springs, whole other story.
[46:18.700 --> 46:19.700]  Right.
[46:19.700 --> 46:20.700]  Yeah.
[46:20.700 --> 46:21.700]  We have the same issues in Pueblo.
[46:21.700 --> 46:25.700]  It feels like our city council hears us and we're like, we want social clubs.
[46:25.700 --> 46:28.700]  And they turn around and they talk to each other and they turn around and they go, guess what?
[46:28.700 --> 46:30.700]  That's crazy how that happens too.
[46:30.700 --> 46:35.700]  They just have these conversations right in front of you and it's insane.
[46:35.700 --> 46:36.700]  Yeah.
[46:36.700 --> 46:38.700]  And aren't they there to represent us?
[46:38.700 --> 46:41.700]  Aren't we supposed to be telling them what they want?
[46:41.700 --> 46:42.700]  They provide it.
[46:42.700 --> 46:44.700]  And then 200 people show up and they say, we want this.
[46:44.700 --> 46:46.700]  And two people say no.
[46:46.700 --> 46:49.700]  And the whole city council can say, oh yeah, no.
[46:49.700 --> 46:50.700]  You brought that up, did you?
[46:50.700 --> 46:51.700]  I did.
[46:51.700 --> 46:54.700]  Yeah, you were saying it's just stacked.
[46:54.700 --> 46:55.700]  Yeah.
[46:55.700 --> 46:58.700]  It's incredibly upsetting to me.
[46:58.700 --> 46:59.700]  It's so upsetting to me.
[46:59.700 --> 47:01.700]  So sorry if I'm for a lack of words at the moment.
[47:01.700 --> 47:04.700]  But yeah, that is infuriating to see that.
[47:04.700 --> 47:09.700]  And it's like four people come up, wait is bad.
[47:09.700 --> 47:15.700]  And they're spitting out facts that you could go on the internet and it's like, yeah, that's been disproven.
[47:15.700 --> 47:19.700]  They're reading shit off a piece of paper, not looking anyone in the eye, then walking out of the room right afterwards.
[47:19.700 --> 47:24.700]  And it's stacked because they had the people that were for against all go up first.
[47:25.700 --> 47:27.700]  It's not like normal sessions.
[47:27.700 --> 47:32.700]  Everybody's allowed to voice their opinion whether for or against equally at the same time.
[47:32.700 --> 47:34.700]  That way you can hear both sides.
[47:34.700 --> 47:38.700]  No, they said their thing and they got to leave because they're like, yeah, we're not going to make these old people stay.
[47:38.700 --> 47:39.700]  And that's who it was.
[47:39.700 --> 47:41.700]  The people that were complaining were over 60.
[47:41.700 --> 47:42.700]  And you know what?
[47:42.700 --> 47:43.700]  That's not cool.
[47:43.700 --> 47:46.700]  And you made a very valid point, Matt, about a lot of these complaints.
[47:46.700 --> 47:48.700]  It's just pure Reefer Madness propaganda.
[47:48.700 --> 47:49.700]  Exactly.
[47:49.700 --> 47:57.700]  And a lot of people that were making these complaints were more about the opposition of what happened after we voted in Amendment 64 than about the clubs themselves.
[47:57.700 --> 48:01.700]  And I feel like that distinction was completely lost in translation.
[48:01.700 --> 48:08.700]  Yeah, most of them, like they would say things like I live next door to an apartment complex.
[48:08.700 --> 48:12.700]  And the people there, they smoke marijuanas.
[48:12.700 --> 48:18.700]  And they grow the marijuanas and they vent it right out into the open.
[48:18.700 --> 48:19.700]  And it stinks.
[48:19.700 --> 48:20.700]  And it smells so loud.
[48:20.700 --> 48:24.700]  And it's like it had nothing to do with the actual consumption clubs whatsoever.
[48:24.700 --> 48:25.700]  No, it didn't.
[48:25.700 --> 48:29.700]  They were complaining about the ancillary effects of Amendment 64.
[48:29.700 --> 48:31.700]  They're just stuck in the mud.
[48:31.700 --> 48:40.700]  And if they have a problem with it, then they should take it up with the voters who actually voted Amendment 64 into our state constitution.
[48:40.700 --> 48:42.700]  It is a constitution right now.
[48:42.700 --> 48:43.700]  Instead of stepping up now.
[48:43.700 --> 48:44.700]  I agree with you.
[48:44.700 --> 48:46.700]  I love it when people call it marijuanas.
[48:46.700 --> 48:47.700]  Yeah, marijuanas.
[48:47.700 --> 48:48.700]  The marijuanas.
[48:48.700 --> 48:49.700]  You know they're highly educated.
[48:49.700 --> 48:51.700]  We pluralize it because we know so much about it.
[48:51.700 --> 48:53.700]  The marijuanas.
[48:53.700 --> 48:55.700]  And also CBD.
[48:55.700 --> 48:59.700]  I don't like it when people pluralize CBD.
[48:59.700 --> 49:00.700]  The CBDs.
[49:00.700 --> 49:02.700]  Did you say THCs?
[49:02.700 --> 49:03.700]  It just doesn't make sense.
[49:03.700 --> 49:05.700]  I need a glass of waters.
[49:05.700 --> 49:06.700]  Yeah.
[49:06.700 --> 49:07.700]  All right, guys.
[49:07.700 --> 49:08.700]  Thank you for saying that.
[49:08.700 --> 49:10.700]  Yeah, I sometimes have some shit on my chest.
[49:10.700 --> 49:11.700]  So much.
[49:11.700 --> 49:12.700]  I just need to get off on a podcast.
[49:12.700 --> 49:13.700]  Oh, my goodness.
[49:13.700 --> 49:14.700]  Yeah.
[49:14.700 --> 49:16.700]  I don't even get on the left lane drivers anymore.
[49:16.700 --> 49:17.700]  Oh, good.
[49:17.700 --> 49:19.700]  So these clubs are important, you guys.
[49:19.700 --> 49:22.700]  We need to do everything we can to get city council to...
[49:22.700 --> 49:23.700]  Absolutely.
[49:23.700 --> 49:25.700]  What can we do for the next eight years?
[49:25.700 --> 49:27.700]  Is there anything we can do to sway them on that one?
[49:27.700 --> 49:29.700]  Or is that a permanent thing here in Springs?
[49:29.700 --> 49:30.700]  Well...
[49:30.700 --> 49:31.700]  Oh.
[49:31.700 --> 49:32.700]  No, go ahead.
[49:32.700 --> 49:33.700]  Okay.
[49:33.700 --> 49:38.700]  So right now what I can say is that there are petitions at a lot of the clubs here in town
[49:38.700 --> 49:39.700]  to kind of...
[49:39.700 --> 49:40.700]  What's the word?
[49:40.700 --> 49:41.700]  Recall.
[49:41.700 --> 49:42.700]  Yeah.
[49:42.700 --> 49:43.700]  Recall.
[49:43.700 --> 49:44.700]  Recall.
[49:44.700 --> 49:45.700]  Yeah, recall the ban.
[49:45.700 --> 49:46.700]  So you can get out there.
[49:46.700 --> 49:49.700]  You can put your name on the list.
[49:49.700 --> 49:52.700]  Let your city know that this is not something you're down for.
[49:52.700 --> 49:54.700]  And that's what we can do initially.
[49:54.700 --> 49:57.700]  There's also an online petition, too.
[49:57.700 --> 49:59.700]  There's an online petition as well, Stephen says.
[49:59.700 --> 50:01.700]  Stephen and Camille are politely sharing a mic.
[50:01.700 --> 50:03.700]  So sometimes Stephen gets cut off here.
[50:03.700 --> 50:04.700]  He's looking for the petition.
[50:04.700 --> 50:05.700]  He's searching in his phone.
[50:05.700 --> 50:09.700]  And since I am not a Colorado Springs resident, am I able to sign that petition?
[50:09.700 --> 50:10.700]  Yes.
[50:10.700 --> 50:11.700]  Yes.
[50:11.700 --> 50:12.700]  It's a Colorado State thing.
[50:12.700 --> 50:13.700]  Yes.
[50:13.700 --> 50:14.700]  All right.
[50:14.700 --> 50:15.700]  So I will sign that for you guys.
[50:15.700 --> 50:16.700]  Thank you.
[50:16.700 --> 50:17.700]  I'm a Pueblo resident.
[50:17.700 --> 50:18.700]  Awesome.
[50:18.700 --> 50:19.700]  Thank you.
[50:19.700 --> 50:20.700]  I guess that's awesome.
[50:20.700 --> 50:21.700]  Kabuki, you're going to be a Pueblo guy here.
[50:21.700 --> 50:22.700]  Yeah, I will be.
[50:22.700 --> 50:23.700]  I'm sorry.
[50:23.700 --> 50:24.700]  Should I have said that on the show?
[50:24.700 --> 50:25.700]  No, you're good.
[50:25.700 --> 50:26.700]  I don't give a shit.
[50:26.700 --> 50:27.700]  Come find me in Pueblo.
[50:27.700 --> 50:28.700]  Welcome to the hood, bro.
[50:28.700 --> 50:29.700]  Welcome to the hood.
[50:29.700 --> 50:30.700]  I'm excited, dude.
[50:30.700 --> 50:31.700]  I don't know how...
[50:31.700 --> 50:32.700]  I think you're going to be on the podcast more frequently.
[50:32.700 --> 50:33.700]  Yeah.
[50:33.700 --> 50:34.700]  And so my friend who just...
[50:34.700 --> 50:39.700]  Totally off topic, but he just got 300 acres in Pueblo and totally dedicated to his CBD
[50:40.700 --> 50:43.460]  So I'm going to be doing a little bit of consulting out there with him as well.
[50:43.460 --> 50:44.780]  So it'll be some fun stuff.
[50:44.780 --> 50:46.580]  If you guys need help, I know the guy for you.
[50:46.580 --> 50:48.460]  He's been on the podcast several times.
[50:48.460 --> 50:49.460]  Sweet shit.
[50:49.460 --> 50:50.460]  Yeah.
[50:50.460 --> 50:51.460]  Awesome.
[50:51.460 --> 50:52.460]  Sweet.
[50:52.460 --> 50:53.460]  All right.
[50:53.460 --> 50:54.460]  Okay.
[50:54.460 --> 50:55.460]  So we got this website.
[50:55.460 --> 50:56.460]  Looks like the website is Geopetition.
[50:56.460 --> 50:57.460]  G-E-O...
[50:57.460 --> 50:58.460]  Oh, GoPetition.
[50:58.460 --> 50:59.460]  I'm sorry.
[50:59.460 --> 51:00.460]  GoPetition.
[51:00.460 --> 51:01.460]  G-O-P-E-T-I-T-I-O-N.com.
[51:01.460 --> 51:02.460]  And then just search Stop Social Cloning.
[51:02.460 --> 51:03.460]  And then just search Stop Social Cloning.
[51:03.460 --> 51:04.460]  And then just search Stop Social Cloning.
[51:04.460 --> 51:05.460]  And then just search Stop Social Cloning.
[51:05.460 --> 51:06.460]  And then just search Stop Social Cloning.
[51:06.460 --> 51:11.980]  And then just search Stop Social Club Ban.
[51:11.980 --> 51:12.980]  And it'll come up.
[51:12.980 --> 51:17.020]  So if you just want to hang out at home, smoke a couple bowls, might as well jump on your
[51:17.020 --> 51:18.020]  computer and...
[51:18.020 --> 51:19.020]  Or your phone.
[51:19.020 --> 51:20.020]  Or your phone.
[51:20.020 --> 51:21.020]  You're looking at Facebook anyway.
[51:21.020 --> 51:22.020]  You're on Instagram anyway.
[51:22.020 --> 51:23.020]  Go spend that time signing a petition.
[51:23.020 --> 51:24.020]  Make it worth it.
[51:24.020 --> 51:25.020]  So GoPetition.com.
[51:25.020 --> 51:28.820]  So all you have to do is open the show notes and click it.
[51:28.820 --> 51:31.580]  If you've got a phone, tap on my face.
[51:31.580 --> 51:35.220]  If you're looking at my face on your face or on your iTunes, tap on my face.
[51:35.220 --> 51:36.580]  It'll spin around and show you show notes.
[51:36.580 --> 51:37.860]  There's a link in there.
[51:37.860 --> 51:38.860]  Click on that link.
[51:38.860 --> 51:39.860]  It'll take you to this petition, you guys.
[51:39.860 --> 51:42.500]  I'm just gonna do it so I can spin your face over and over.
[51:42.500 --> 51:43.500]  Awesome.

[51:46.260 --> 51:47.260]  Go to my website.
[51:47.260 --> 51:48.700]  It'll be in the show notes also.
[51:48.700 --> 51:49.700]  Go to the website.
[51:49.700 --> 51:51.380]  Go to the Grow From Your Heart podcast tab.
[51:51.380 --> 51:52.380]  Click on the newest episode.
[51:52.380 --> 51:53.380]  It'll be right there in the show notes.
[51:53.380 --> 51:54.740]  There will be a link if you're lazy.
[51:54.740 --> 51:55.940]  You won't have to type anything in.
[51:55.940 --> 51:56.940]  We'll hook you up.
[51:56.940 --> 51:59.540]  I want everybody in Colorado to sign it.
[51:59.540 --> 52:05.180]  If you're a computer nerd, figure out some way to set up your computer and proxy in and
[52:05.180 --> 52:09.860]  change your IP address every time and just sign this petition a billion times.
[52:09.860 --> 52:11.980]  I didn't say that on the air.
[52:11.980 --> 52:13.980]  Hire some kid in Malaysia to do it on Fiverr.
[52:13.980 --> 52:14.980]  Yeah, that's fine.
[52:14.980 --> 52:16.740]  I'm not gonna argue with you.
[52:16.740 --> 52:20.100]  Also in the Kandem's community, after that whole city council thing went down, a lot
[52:20.100 --> 52:23.300]  of people are talking about running for office now.
[52:23.300 --> 52:24.300]  Oh, yeah.
[52:24.300 --> 52:25.860]  Yeah, someone needs to.
[52:25.860 --> 52:26.860]  Kabuki.
[52:26.860 --> 52:32.980]  Okay, the problem with that is a lot.
[52:32.980 --> 52:33.980]  Maybe in Pueblo.
[52:34.300 --> 52:35.300]  Here's the thing.
[52:35.300 --> 52:38.900]  What's happening in the Springs right now, yes, we obviously need a voice.
[52:38.900 --> 52:44.260]  We need a voice on that council, but I think it also starts with maybe removing if these
[52:44.260 --> 52:48.100]  people who are supposed to represent us won't listen, then maybe they shouldn't be representing
[52:48.100 --> 52:49.580]  us and that's what it comes down to.
[52:49.580 --> 52:51.140]  That's their job is to listen to us.
[52:51.140 --> 52:55.740]  Maybe getting that rotten apple out of the bunch and trying to progressively put someone
[52:55.740 --> 52:58.660]  who will voice all of our concerns.
[52:58.660 --> 53:05.540]  I mean, yeah, we do need to find someone and I wish I had the time, but I know there
[53:05.540 --> 53:11.540]  are much more people out there, much more qualified to do something like that and I
[53:11.540 --> 53:14.260]  would willingly back them 100%.
[53:14.260 --> 53:18.140]  Foxtracks runs CBD Genetics and just me as a person, as an advocate, and I know-
[53:18.140 --> 53:19.140]  CBD Thursdays.
[53:19.140 --> 53:20.140]  Yeah, sure, why not?
[53:20.140 --> 53:21.140]  As a council.
[53:21.140 --> 53:22.140]  Yeah.
[53:22.140 --> 53:23.140]  Dude, someone's gotta teach them, but-
[53:23.140 --> 53:24.140]  Well, that's the thing.
[53:24.140 --> 53:25.140]  There needs to be education.
[53:25.140 --> 53:26.140]  These guys are not going to be here.
[53:26.140 --> 53:27.140]  Yeah.
[53:27.140 --> 53:28.140]  These guys have no education.
[53:28.140 --> 53:29.140]  They're basing all of their decisions on their emotions and the people that might-
[53:29.140 --> 53:30.140]  50 year old arguments.
[53:30.140 --> 53:31.140]  Oh, yeah.
[53:31.140 --> 53:32.140]  I would say direct to them the most-
[53:32.140 --> 53:33.140]  Outdated medical information.
[53:33.140 --> 53:34.140]  Exactly.
[53:34.140 --> 53:35.140]  And what's happening is when you have maybe seven people come up and say no and you have
[53:35.140 --> 53:36.140]  over 200 people willing to testify that they want something, you should be supporting the
[53:36.140 --> 53:37.140]  people that want it.
[53:37.140 --> 53:38.140]  I mean, that's what the people want.
[53:38.140 --> 53:39.140]  Or interest.
[53:39.140 --> 53:40.140]  Or interest.
[53:40.140 --> 53:41.140]  Or interest.
[53:41.140 --> 53:42.140]  Or interest.
[53:42.140 --> 53:43.140]  Or interest.
[53:43.140 --> 53:44.140]  Or interest.
[53:44.140 --> 53:45.140]  Or interest.
[53:45.140 --> 53:46.140]  Or interest.
[53:46.140 --> 53:47.140]  Or interest.
[53:47.140 --> 53:48.140]  Or interest.
[53:48.140 --> 53:49.140]  Or interest.
[53:49.140 --> 53:50.140]  Or interest.
[53:50.140 --> 53:51.140]  Or interest.
[53:51.140 --> 53:52.140]  Or interest.
[53:52.140 --> 53:53.140]  Or interest.
[53:53.140 --> 53:54.140]  Or interest.
[53:54.140 --> 53:55.140]  Or interest.
[53:55.140 --> 53:56.140]  And that's what the people want.
[53:56.140 --> 53:57.140]  And it's not-
[53:57.140 --> 53:58.140]  Or at least-
[53:58.140 --> 53:59.140]  It's fair.
[53:59.140 --> 54:07.860]  It's insane to me that you can not even just hear or try to shelve it to make 200 people-
[54:07.860 --> 54:11.920]  I mean, was it less than 12 people that came up against it?
[54:11.920 --> 54:12.920]  It didn't seem-
[54:12.920 --> 54:13.920]  It was 11, I think.
[54:13.920 --> 54:14.920]  Okay.
[54:14.920 --> 54:15.920]  Yeah.
[54:15.920 --> 54:16.920]  So less than a dozen people to 200 people in a room.
[54:16.920 --> 54:17.920]  Mostly veterans.
[54:17.920 --> 54:18.920]  30 minutes a piece?
[54:18.920 --> 54:19.920]  And that was about 30 minutes-
[54:19.920 --> 54:20.920]  Yeah.
[54:20.920 --> 54:21.920]  Of testimony and five hours.
[54:21.920 --> 54:22.920]  Right?
[54:22.920 --> 54:23.920]  Yeah.
[54:23.920 --> 54:24.920]  Wow.
[54:24.920 --> 54:31.360]  You know you disrespect other veterans you don't even acknowledge that you're a veteran and then you sit there and you may have these smart
[54:31.360 --> 54:34.480]  Ass looks like wasn't one of them nodding off
[54:38.120 --> 54:42.800]  Someone did because that would have made me fierce other throwing a shoe at that dude. I mean, that's it's ridiculous
[54:42.800 --> 54:44.800]  You know you got guys
[54:45.240 --> 54:51.560]  Crying yeah, the only job is to stay awake. This is your job. Yeah, I mean yeah, and they're all over 64 most of
[54:52.360 --> 54:54.360]  You know
[54:55.200 --> 54:58.160]  If you're over 50 it's time to leave office isn't there the right to
[54:58.560 --> 55:03.320]  Redo the entire meeting since somebody fell asleep there was a member not present for the 88
[55:03.480 --> 55:08.840]  They they didn't even represent deaf people there. You know have a person that does sign language there
[55:10.200 --> 55:12.800]  Who's good with the legal shit in Springs help us out here?
[55:12.800 --> 55:17.640]  Maybe that meeting can be totally redone since a city council member took a nap during the meeting
[55:17.640 --> 55:21.380]  Maybe we need to redo on that whole thing maybe since there wasn't something there for deaf people
[55:21.560 --> 55:26.120]  So that they could hear and participate as well. Maybe we need to redo. Maybe we need to try that one over
[55:26.120 --> 55:32.240]  We absolutely can you guys I'm curious to see how this second vote will go on. What's the ones the date?
[55:33.440 --> 55:36.680]  Right March 22nd, okay, can the public come to that one again?
[55:39.120 --> 55:45.600]  Yeah, they're not gonna actually allow public comment on that so can I stand outside and look like we can protest yeah
[55:45.680 --> 55:52.800]  Protests actually is the our best bet right now is to call like a massive amount of people and show people how unhappy we are
[55:53.160 --> 55:56.840]  But I still don't think that that would actually sway their vote
[55:56.840 --> 56:01.480]  But it would at least show them what they're doing is wrong and we are starting to assemble
[56:01.520 --> 56:02.000]  Yeah
[56:02.000 --> 56:07.520]  Exactly that we are active and that we can we can actually change the face of politics in Colorado Springs
[56:07.520 --> 56:09.520]  We can get them on out of office
[56:10.480 --> 56:15.360]  You know I'm sorry go ahead brother. I've just seen it done in Denver. You know I've
[56:16.000 --> 56:18.240]  up to the Capitol plenty times to
[56:19.520 --> 56:22.000]  Stop this shit for lack of better words
[56:22.520 --> 56:28.480]  They've so many bills that they've tried to pass with children not being able to medicate on school grounds
[56:28.800 --> 56:30.560]  them trying to
[56:30.560 --> 56:37.160]  CPS trying to say that any parent with a red card was you know basically
[56:38.200 --> 56:40.000]  You know
[56:40.000 --> 56:42.960]  Endangering endangering their child you know if they had yeah
[56:42.960 --> 56:48.120]  Just a whole bunch of shit that we've had to go through so I feel like in the Springs first of all
[56:48.440 --> 56:51.400]  Educating people about what's going on just like we did in Denver
[56:52.160 --> 56:57.560]  and bringing making people aware of everything and then like I like Matt said
[56:58.120 --> 57:02.840]  Getting people together to actually show that we can be the face of change
[57:03.160 --> 57:09.400]  We do need that down here these clubs are essential limiting that plant count is absolute bullshit
[57:10.200 --> 57:16.920]  I've been getting phone calls non-stop from these parents that are freaking out about that and patients that are freaking out because they're
[57:17.240 --> 57:22.680]  Actively growing anywhere from you know whatever you know 24 to 36 to 60 plants
[57:22.680 --> 57:24.680]  You know whatever the case is pending on their needs
[57:25.120 --> 57:28.920]  Without a problem without there ever being overges or stacks or sometimes
[57:28.920 --> 57:34.320]  They still come short up for their medicine when it comes time to be processed even with that many plants depending on what they grow
[57:34.320 --> 57:38.840]  And how they grow so I just think it's insane for an Olympic City
[57:39.400 --> 57:45.600]  to talk about limiting what patients can't and cannot grow and how they
[57:46.200 --> 57:53.320]  It just upsets me so much that that also wasn't talked about enough that wasn't you know the other focus on the club
[57:53.320 --> 57:54.760]  It's equally important
[57:54.760 --> 58:00.280]  But I feel like they're sliding one in with the other and that's horseshit and that needs to be addressed more
[58:00.280 --> 58:04.240]  and I feel like within the group of everyone that's for the clubs and
[58:05.200 --> 58:12.280]  I don't think enough people are aware about these plant counts if I if we bring both these groups of people together that have this
[58:12.280 --> 58:17.920]  The same invested interest I think we'd have a greater showing and that's just you know my personal opinion
[58:17.920 --> 58:24.580]  So I'm more than happy to reach out to the people that I know that are really coming at me and are distraught about them
[58:24.580 --> 58:30.680]  You know cutting down the residential plant count and obviously you know we know all the veterans and all our friends and all our
[58:30.960 --> 58:36.520]  Colleagues that are in this business that are for these clubs that are doing amazing things in the community. Let's get together
[58:36.520 --> 58:41.680]  This is the only way we're gonna make a change is to put any little thing aside and come together
[58:41.680 --> 58:46.120]  So we can actually show them the real numbers and the real faces of the people that they're affecting
[58:46.120 --> 58:48.880]  Should do you think would be so bold to show them?
[58:49.120 --> 58:53.360]  Give them maybe a preview of what's gonna happen if they ban these clubs on the 22nd
[58:53.640 --> 58:59.240]  Let's say we get a thousand people out there by City Council and just smoke it up. Let's show them what happens
[59:00.680 --> 59:06.560]  Massive civil disobedience and sometimes it works. Yeah, I mean that might be what it takes to show them
[59:06.560 --> 59:09.700]  I mean we want our clubs. We don't want to do this, but
[59:10.220 --> 59:15.080]  Maybe this is an example. We need to say where does that lead us and how okay?
[59:15.080 --> 59:16.880]  So and that was something us
[59:16.880 --> 59:22.680]  I don't know if it was you or somebody else brought a point up about Manitou and then being in the same El Paso County and
[59:22.760 --> 59:27.680]  Them allowing recreational cannabis do they have clubs in Manitou or no?
[59:28.680 --> 59:34.880]  Okay, so I just don't understand how you're going to allow these different assets
[59:34.880 --> 59:39.760]  You know these even with medical medical dispensaries. We have a ton down here in the Springs
[59:39.760 --> 59:45.880]  we have a ton of places where medical and recreational patients can go and take be taken care of and
[59:47.040 --> 59:48.720]  Then where they go
[59:48.720 --> 59:50.720]  That's just the truth of it. That's that
[59:51.080 --> 59:54.120]  Why are you setting up your oh the police chiefs?
[59:54.120 --> 59:58.080]  I mean just to not to jump on my note, but he came in the room and basically said
[59:58.960 --> 01:00:02.240]  This is this is not enforceable. So
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:08.440]  And that being said that's coming from the words of the police chief of our city
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:15.440]  Basically telling us that there's really no way for them to be able to enforce this didn't he say he put in 900 hours of man
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.480]  9,000 hours
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:21.520]  These clubs and still was unable to bring a single
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:26.180]  Advocate to college and whatever it was in our tax money. Like I'm just saying like
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:31.080]  9,000 hours divided by 40 hour other cops for our work week
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:38.440]  How many cops was that for how much time? Holy? Yeah. Yeah for one club citizens of Colorado Springs you paid for that
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:44.880]  Your money guys our money no charges brought nine thousand hours
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:47.960]  at a cop's wage
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.920]  So that's what you guys paid for them to come and hang out at one of these clubs with us try to mingle
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  Yeah, and they still don't understand. They probably came here and got stoned and hung out and had a great ass time
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.520]  I don't know. Yeah watch cartoons and eat pizza
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:08.500]  But yeah, so that's also it creates a little confusion because you have the council saying one thing
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:11.280]  Police chief is telling you another
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:15.440]  Citizens saying a completely different thing. Yeah, no one's being heard
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:18.320]  You have a couple
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:21.880]  Yeah
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:27.920]  Police isn't gonna enforce it and the citizens obviously want it. It's only a matter of time
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.440]  When that wall breaks and we just keep pushing forward. Yep. So there you go
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:40.960]  I have a question for Camille if now that they've done this they giving you eight years to recoup your funds and there's no regulation
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.480]  Doesn't that reopen the black market?
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.360]  Can it I
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:46.960]  Wasn't there
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:49.880]  encourages the Craigslist seller it encourages
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:55.480]  Deals going on behind in parks behind schools and parking lots
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:58.880]  That's what that encourages now. We have
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:01.000]  tourists
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.880]  Like I said jumping on Craigslist looking for 420 weed marijuana
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:09.160]  These are things that were brought up at the meeting
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:13.240]  For the licensing with K repaying Jonathan singer so
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:18.040]  They're just not thinking it through like at all, huh
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:22.000]  It's all about the outside image, even though you can see through it
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:27.880]  It's all about what it brings to other cities or other businesses that may want to come to this city
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.600]  It's a very military town. There's a lot of military influence here and
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:35.040]  Church and church. Yeah both. Yeah, I mean
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.400]  Kind of a
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:44.360]  They want to keep that image they don't want to look like Pueblo or Denver they want to have that clean military churchy feel
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:49.720]  Yeah, unfortunately the data goes the other way after they legalized marijuana
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:54.480]  Soldiers pissing hot actually went down
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:59.280]  They went in the opposite direction now that it's legal it's no fun
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:07.720]  Yeah
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:10.160]  They'll do their you know
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:16.360]  And that's how most veterans that I know even felt being out of state out of medical states as you know
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:21.040]  they do their time or you know, they serve their tour or whatever the case is and come back and
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:26.280]  Medicaid and be done with the whole thing grow on their beard and be happy, you know
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:30.800]  When he comes to Colorado, yeah, you know why fuck it up while you're working
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:36.240]  You know those if your employers says you can't then obviously that's the rule of the game if that's how you're getting your money
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:40.320]  You know if that's what's paying for your school why jeopardize it, you know true
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:44.580]  I know more people I think about that way than the other but at the same time
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:52.360]  That's also asking someone not to medicate and that's a very hard choice that people have to make to make all those decisions
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:54.640]  so, you know, it's a
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:56.960]  Double-edged sword on that thought, you know
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:01.160]  But to that thought of this place being a
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  church heavy
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:05.840]  military town
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:12.440]  Dude, I know more housewives and girls. I know that consume cannabis, you know
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:15.880]  That's such a closeted thing in this community. It's really funny
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:25.760]  The the biggest growing demographic of weed smokers is above 55 nice
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:27.960]  Yeah, people that are retired
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:34.920]  Elderly people are flocking to Colorado in order to retire because they want to smoke weed when that's all tire. That's great
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:45.680]  Tourists who become members who are definitely older just kind of want the experience ask questions like well
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:48.200]  What is a gram look like? What is a dab?
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:54.560]  What what are people saying this thing called a salvia or sativa? What does that mean?
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:57.680]  Educating these people they really just
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:02.160]  Wanna experience it for the first time like that's awesome
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:08.240]  It's great to have people like you here to invite those people into the community and welcome and show them how it's done. Yeah with
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:11.000]  Welcoming arms. Yeah, totally. Yeah, so
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:13.920]  You're here half the time Kabuki
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:21.480]  Yeah, most of those people are profoundly grateful that these places exist, you know
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:25.840]  I mean and it showed that the other night. I mean a lot of them broke down into tears
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:33.280]  You got people that just bought their first medicine or their first cannabis their first stab there in their car some first marijuana
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:39.160]  Have you guys seen that there's a documentary where the dudes like in the bottom of the pipe
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:49.480]  I get the glass hot and somebody here will definitely show you
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:59.480]  Going into a dispensary and talking to some chick that has big tits and has no education on what strain does water this or that
[01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:01.480]  She's just there
[01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:06.000]  Well, yeah that falls up to management, you know and they're right to that regard
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.880]  I will say I love the Springs that there are a lot of places here that have good
[01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:17.840]  Educated bud tenders and I don't you go into a club like this. It's a different vibe more education
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:23.440]  And there's also another issue I mean if you get you get a 21 year old kid, you know
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:25.960]  would you rather him go to a bar where a
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:33.040]  Bartender can sit there and monitor him and then cut him off when he's had enough or would you rather him go to a liquor?
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:37.840]  Store and go home with a bottle of vodka and get himself stupid drunk and end up
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:42.520]  Destroying something or getting behind the wheel and destroying somebody. Yeah
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:49.480]  I'd rather him be at a cannabis club not drinking if he were my son sitting on the couch
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:52.320]  intellectual conversation listening to laid-back music
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:56.600]  The worst thing that's gonna happen is they might fall asleep on the couch and you get a little yeah
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:02.720]  And I see people do that at these clubs members might not offer whatever the case is
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:07.080]  None of these club owners wake them up early to leave or you know
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:12.440]  It's not about a turnkey spot thing and they rest there comfortably till they're comfortable enough to wake up
[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:16.200]  And you know, they make sure they're okay. They're hydrated every club
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:20.040]  I've been to has literally had that mentality and I point that out to people because
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:24.920]  People don't know and they assume that it runs like something that's not I
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.120]  Like to take huge dabs
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:31.280]  And to sometimes when I take a giant dab here before I can blow it all the way out
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:34.220]  Somebody's got a bottle of water in my face like you're gonna need this
[01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:37.220]  Look out for each other
[01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:43.380]  You never have to cough more than once or twice before someone's got water for you
[01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:49.340]  They're free. Thanks. Oh, yeah, if you're thirsty, you need a couch and a dab. It's a great spot
[01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:54.580]  The mixture of people is always great here too. Oh, yeah, definitely
[01:07:54.580 --> 01:08:00.020]  I got dreadlocks down to my butt and I'm sitting next to a veteran. So it's awesome. Like I love it
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:06.660]  Definitely to dreads veterans a guy from Miami
[01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:15.660]  This is honestly I've done several podcasts away from my home studio and this is my favorite that I've done on another couch
[01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:25.500]  To the listeners when it comes time
[01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:30.540]  So let's be proactive it's time if you're in Colorado and you do not have rules on social clubs
[01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:34.780]  It's time for you or your nerdy friend that's involved in the politics. You know who he is
[01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:39.140]  He's in every group get him those. Oh, is that one guy Mike? That's you in Pueblo, bro
[01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:46.100]  Get you guys together and start making rules for social smoke clubs in your city before they get bad to be proactive
[01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:47.500]  Put that out there
[01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:49.460]  I don't know exactly the steps on how to do that
[01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:54.420]  But one of your friends does knows how to create an initiative knows how to get a petition started
[01:08:54.420 --> 01:09:01.220]  They know how to get it going. That's probably you in your group, right Matt exactly veterans for natural rights basically exist to push policy
[01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:03.540]  we
[01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:05.540]  defend all kinds of
[01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:11.020]  Natural individual rights such as the right to medicate yourself the way you please also
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:13.780]  veterans rights any other
[01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:21.180]  Individual right that has to do with freedom and liberty the right to safe access medicine safe access of medicine
[01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:27.700]  Is the primary one that we lobby on here in Colorado because it is such a big issue here. This is a new industry
[01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:29.700]  It's forming and
[01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:32.840]  It's the Wild West, you know, there's there's no real
[01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:39.620]  Regulation is being crafted right now. We're setting policy and everyone's eyes are on us. We are the revolution
[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:42.440]  Yes, it's great to be a part of it. Thanks for standing up for it with us
[01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:46.060]  Well, it's I'm proud to do so. Thank you. Thank you
[01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:51.600]  So now also if you are in a state that has not gone legal with cannabis yet
[01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:56.820]  Start if you're writing the rules to create medical and or recreational cannabis in your state
[01:09:57.020 --> 01:10:00.120]  Be sure to include these social clubs
[01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:03.220]  Make sure they can be open to make sure that they exist
[01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:09.700]  Make sure they're regulated in a fair way make it I recommend that you make it to where these places have a grow
[01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:15.960]  Toward these social clubs have a grow attached to them that can provide the product to this place would be ideal in my opinion
[01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:19.980]  Or at least a private grower right that has like an overabundance
[01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:26.900]  They want to offload their their extra they should be able to do that. I mean we should be able to
[01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:31.460]  Stimulate and stabilize the economy in every shape and way and manner
[01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:35.580]  I mean it only makes sense to do that and by blocking that we're just blocking
[01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:42.900]  You know really good medicine that otherwise could be shared all over the city. How many potholes did you guys hit on the way over here?
[01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:44.900]  Oh shit, yeah, right
[01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:51.740]  Every six months in Colorado Springs because of the potholes if we could kind of do proper things with the tax money
[01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:55.780]  Yeah, generate proper tax revenue places like this. We could fix some of the damn potholes
[01:10:56.420 --> 01:11:00.440]  Pothole could be filled with pot. Yep. Fill those potholes with pot money. Let's do it
[01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:08.180]  I want to give a shout out to Rhode Island. I was told that in Rhode Island the dispensaries are going to open without
[01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:14.400]  grows attached and the grows will be done by guys like you and I that know how to grow and we can take it to
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:16.400]  The dispensaries and legally sell it to them
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:30.420]  You do three three sheets of paper you get it tested then you can go
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:43.340]  Every last grower the top-notch growers in Colorado. They they're not at dispensaries. No, they're independent
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:51.760]  Who are running their own grows and they're growing the best medicine in the entire state in the entire country in the entire world
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:54.680]  all the best growers I know are
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:57.600]  independent growers or breeders or
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:00.160]  not working
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:08.560]  Yeah, and it's very rare I maybe you I guess like I'm Jeff you're the first I'm trying I have run a small grow
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:14.160]  I've got a very small grow that I breed a lot in mostly I'm trying to bring that quality to this large facility
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:16.160]  I'm running the green and healthy wellness grow now
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:19.680]  85 flowering lights. I see why the quality
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:24.160]  Falls off a little bit. It's a lot of stuff to manage. It's a new environment
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:28.400]  You can't just throw up a 14,000 BTU air conditioner a couple of blowers a fan
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:34.040]  I'm gonna go and you gotta put in tons of air conditioning. You have to have ducting for days
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:38.280]  There are miles of PVC tubing in that grow. I use
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:42.160]  One room uses a thousand gallons of water a day
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:47.360]  If I mix one of those tanks off of it, imagine the amounts of nutrients I'm mixing. There's
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:55.080]  1750 milliliters of one nutrient that goes in there and I'm using five or six different things if I mess one of those up
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:57.080]  Imagine the catastrophe
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:03.280]  Yeah, yeah, so they're trying to bring that level of quality to that playing field. It's a true challenge
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:07.640]  No, absolutely. And a lot of people don't take any of those things into account. I brought that up. Yeah
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:12.960]  Yeah, that's definitely other I see why the small boutique grows are
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:18.560]  Preferred and beneficial it's hard to get this stuff going on in a big facility like that. Yeah, I'll get it there
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:22.760]  I promise for sure man. You're doing most of it solo, right? I
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:29.960]  Can take probably 78% credit for it in the first run at the new grow the ladies helped a lot
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:32.680]  Shout out to damsel and Haley. They did give me a lot of help
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:37.840]  John Hunt is in there as often as he can and then I have a crew of a few dudes that come occasionally
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:41.800]  And do if I need things that I just can't handle by myself. They do de-leafing
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:48.160]  So I could take like 75 80 percent credit for it. That's cool. Yeah, and hunt runs a lot of the bedroom for me
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:52.840]  Nice, that's nice man. Yeah, I see a diving owner that's involved. Yeah, it is
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:58.280]  It's great to have hunt there and involved in helping me out, but I touch every single plant every single course every single day
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:06.800]  First one in last one out awesome. Yeah, that's great man open and close the gate every day
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:12.160]  I love what you do there. I'll keep support. Thank you. Did you get to dab the black cherry Kim live resin? I did

[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:13.600]  With me it's gonna be alright because this is gonna be a very fun episode in my opinion our friend Lindsay the traveling stoner
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:17.400]  She's been on the show a couple of times here a couple of rowdy episodes with a bunch of boys
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:21.680]  She sent me a text message with a whole bunch of questions about
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:26.480]  politics and the upcoming elections and things and I thought
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:30.920]  The best thing we could do is get white Mike over here white Mike is kind of my political expert
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:35.640]  If I have a politics question Mike is the guy that I call everybody needs one of us
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:39.480]  Yeah, yeah, I made a new a new politics friend also in Springs

[01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:56.120]  Opposition would be in some deep shit. I'm dying to get to the candy Canyon after that episode

[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:09.480]  It's my literal favorite place to go in Colorado Springs

[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.620]  But then when I have to go away from one of those two I go to the candy Canyon and turp out

[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:21.200]  Every show comes with a few technical difficulties
[01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:24.080]  Now my headphones aren't working
[01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:28.160]  We're talking about this earlier. There is the I'm gonna wiggle this and see if it cuts in is it coming?
[01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:30.160]  Is it coming nothing?
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:34.400]  So there's a piece that I bought a guitar center. It's the live wire advantage
[01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:38.880]  H a oh for four channel stereo headphone amp
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:41.240]  Fuck that thing. Don't buy one of those
[01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:44.600]  You've got one get it replaced because it's gonna crap out on you and cause you problems
[01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:47.060]  It almost blew Mike's head up the other a couple minutes ago. Yeah
[01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:51.380]  My ears are still ringing a little bit from that volume spike, I apologize
[01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:55.460]  I do it wasn't you as the gear buddy as long as you know that I wasn't doing it on purpose
[01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:59.500]  I need your ears for this show. Don't buy the piece. He said yes, don't buy that. It sucks
[01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:01.900]  I give it a thumbs down five rotten leaves
[01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:02.500]  All right
[01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:09.220]  So we are gonna get to some of these questions that Lindsay that typed very professionally and sent to me in a very nice PDF
[01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:13.860]  This is marvelous. So very good scratch down in a notebook for two weeks
[01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:15.860]  So I'm glad they look marvelous
[01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:19.380]  You got a nice little PowerPoint thing going on here. All right, so
[01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:26.460]  Go ahead and this is my friend Lindsay also known as the Traveling Stoner. Make sure you follow her on Instagram
[01:22:26.660 --> 01:22:33.460]  She does a periscope. She's a great chick. You'd like to watch her. I'm sure she's fun. She's got tattoos and takes fat dabs
[01:22:33.460 --> 01:22:35.460]  There's nothing wrong with that
[01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:40.580]  She's got some dreadlocks
[01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:42.900]  dreadlocks shout out to Chris for putting
[01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:48.220]  Mike looks a little offended. No, I'm just wondering if you can be on the team this early. Yeah
[01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:57.420]  Actually, you're right, okay, the only reason you're right is cuz see I wouldn't know I've had long hair before but I never would dread
[01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:03.140]  Oh since she's had to deal with some social stigma already. She's been harassed by somebody. Yeah, it's official
[01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:08.060]  Not when they went in I
[01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:12.740]  Only ask is I watched what happened when dude got the dreadlocks
[01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:18.780]  Warm for like two festivals and then cut him out. I watched the community revolt around them
[01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:24.340]  Just throw back to car I don't know where that came from that was happened years ago in college
[01:23:24.340 --> 01:23:27.060]  But yeah, I just seemed like a good question to hit you with
[01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:32.060]  Mike's comfortable on the show now. Yes. He is. So he said he was comfortable on the mic
[01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:37.600]  He's like I'll say anything now, right? Like I'm a yeah, there's something about this table and possibly something about dabs
[01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:39.640]  It's both it's both
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:42.200]  Yes
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:51.960]  I've already gotten some serious negativity about them some serious hate. So I'm already gonna call myself team dreadlock. It's it's official
[01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:53.960]  Yep, I'm doing it
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:24:02.500]  All right, so I'm gonna kind of hand you the hosting situation here let you ask Mike some questions
[01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:05.060]  I will definitely interject and drive the show
[01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:09.180]  But I'm gonna sit back and take some dabs of some triangle killer from turpex while you guys chat
[01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:12.420]  So listeners let her know how she does send her some tweets
[01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:16.840]  Send her something on Instagram or on snapchat or make sure you follow her on periscope and let her know
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:22.160]  What you thought of her performance here on the podcast. All right, it's all yours young lady. Have fun cool
[01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:29.480]  So this idea for this podcast actually came from a trip coming over to Colorado while I was moving here in December
[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:33.940]  I spent most of the trip listening to the girl from your heart podcast
[01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:35.900]  and I
[01:24:35.900 --> 01:24:37.980]  Thank you and tell us where you came from
[01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:42.200]  So you know from Florida to Colorado and listen to the podcast
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:46.740]  Yeah, we actually went up to North Carolina first and then came over to so like we had an extra long trip because it was
[01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:50.580]  Christmas so we went to go see my family in North Carolina and then came over
[01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:52.940]  So like I mean it was a nice break for a couple days
[01:24:52.940 --> 01:24:55.520]  But yeah, we definitely got a lot of podcasts listening in
[01:24:57.460 --> 01:25:00.980]  Lot of stats moving for me. Thank you. I think that's why Scooby liked you so much
[01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:02.980]  he's like I've heard this guy's voice already like
[01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:06.860]  Oh
[01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:10.460]  Yeah, he really is but yeah, so
[01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:15.040]  Chris and I were Bobo blaster Co and I were discussing about it the whole time that
[01:25:15.340 --> 01:25:19.980]  You guys really needed to do a show about the upcoming election and that pro
[01:25:20.180 --> 01:25:24.980]  Marijuana people need to know which candidate to vote for and which one will actually help
[01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:30.620]  Marijuana laws get put in place instead of helping us or you know, making us take steps backwards. So
[01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:34.700]  Yeah, so a lot of my questions here about the upcoming election
[01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:41.380]  So I guess my question to you Mike is um, what states look like they'll be legalizing marijuana in the upcoming election
[01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:44.140]  Okay, it's a little too early to tell
[01:25:44.820 --> 01:25:52.420]  What the votes gonna look like come November, but we already know that a number of states are gonna be voting on legalization
[01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:58.340]  Or we've got a good list of states where there are major groups that look like they've got a shot at getting it on
[01:25:58.340 --> 01:26:04.580]  The ballot in November or were states where there's a legislative effort to get it on the ballot in November
[01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:11.380]  In those states or Arizona, California, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada
[01:26:12.180 --> 01:26:14.180]  Rhode Island and Vermont
[01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:21.100]  May all be voting on recreational marijuana this November. Okay states voting on just medical
[01:26:22.140 --> 01:26:25.300]  Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina in Ohio
[01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:27.460]  And
[01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:30.140]  That's a shitload of states voting this November
[01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:33.100]  Other states could make the list
[01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:39.460]  There's still plenty of time in most states for either a ballot initiative or for people to lobby their legislatures
[01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:45.060]  Enough to get the vote on the ballot in November this year. Wow, that is a lot of states
[01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:47.140]  Actually, I wasn't expecting you to say that many right?
[01:26:47.140 --> 01:26:51.700]  That's why I had to make notes for the first time ever when I got emailed this list of questions
[01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:53.700]  Jeff was talking about a minute ago
[01:26:54.420 --> 01:26:59.780]  That nerdy part of my brain got really excited and I was like, this is the show I've been wanting to do and somebody
[01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:02.860]  Did the line it's for you had a nice long list of states there
[01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:09.440]  over because you had medical on one side directly on the other to pay a front and a back side because
[01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:15.740]  I I've got notes on each states effort to I just don't know how in-depth you want to go with this answer
[01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:18.500]  I mean, you can really give it to me. That's fine
[01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:23.300]  Because I mean, you know the articles that I want to write I wanted to do one on each state
[01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:27.180]  So if you want to go through the like just a brief thing on each state, that's totally cool
[01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:30.780]  Well now I tried to avoid the subject but you just said something that I've got to address
[01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:33.580]  I'm gonna bust you out here
[01:27:33.580 --> 01:27:38.900]  She said write articles let our listeners know where those articles are going to appear and who you represent
[01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:39.400]  Yeah
[01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:44.740]  So shout out to miss Mary Jane Coe because I am the new intern blog writer for them
[01:27:44.980 --> 01:27:49.420]  and I have been helping them get their blog up and running and
[01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:56.100]  In production I've been writing the articles and stuff for them. So shout out to miss Mary Jane Coe and Madison and Dan
[01:27:56.660 --> 01:27:59.300]  You know, so that that's where the articles will be
[01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:02.400]  Eventually and you're an intern. Yeah, so you don't get paid
[01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:13.700]  Work on a nice resume. Absolutely. Thanks for supporting the community for free. Absolutely. Yeah, so we all got to do our part you guys
[01:28:13.700 --> 01:28:15.700]  Yeah, all right. I'll step back
[01:28:16.220 --> 01:28:19.380]  We were at which states are voting on legalization
[01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:25.180]  And I was just about to run through a brief little note on each or at least a little note that I made looking these
[01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:27.180]  up this afternoon
[01:28:27.460 --> 01:28:29.460]  This list came out in
[01:28:31.020 --> 01:28:33.020]  December or January
[01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:35.340]  And already it's only March
[01:28:35.340 --> 01:28:41.220]  But there's already been time for another state to make this list and I think possibly for one to drop off of it
[01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:43.660]  but
[01:28:43.660 --> 01:28:48.260]  Back when this was this official list that I kind of stashed was published
[01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:55.700]  Arizona folks, there's a group collecting signatures. They need a hundred and fifty thousand signatures by July 7th
[01:28:56.300 --> 01:28:58.980]  To make the 2016 vote in November
[01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:03.100]  the initiative includes home grow, so
[01:29:04.140 --> 01:29:08.260]  From what I could gather they're gonna have a Colorado style system that includes home grow
[01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:12.180]  Not all the states that are looking to vote on legalization
[01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:18.300]  Have home grow each state has its own initiative. It's an issue. It's an initiative comes with its own rules
[01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:25.020]  We just Ohio vote on legalization and vote against it mainly because of those special rules
[01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:29.220]  They would have had legalization that could have been shopping and weed stores
[01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:35.020]  But chose not to because of who was gonna profit the most from the production into that industry
[01:29:35.820 --> 01:29:41.740]  So if it's written specifically for a bunch of people in your state to make money it's probably not gonna pass
[01:29:44.220 --> 01:29:46.220]  California could go either way
[01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:50.060]  California never shies away from shooting itself in the foot here
[01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:56.340]  They led the way with medical in 96 and that existing industry
[01:29:57.900 --> 01:30:00.900]  Has often worked against legalization efforts
[01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:06.820]  There's a huge black market in California that also works against the legalization efforts
[01:30:07.420 --> 01:30:12.700]  And then there's all the anti pot people and some of the major anti-marijuana groups in the country are based in, California
[01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:21.020]  And all of that doesn't bode well for either of the initiatives in California that are being circulated for signatures right now
[01:30:21.020 --> 01:30:25.420]  I think the Sean Parker backed initiative is already for sure on the ballot
[01:30:25.940 --> 01:30:30.300]  And I know that there's at least one other one looking to be on the ballot competing with it
[01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:38.700]  In Florida two different groups are collecting signatures right now one for medical marijuana one for full legalization
[01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:42.740]  Both initiatives look really popular
[01:30:43.380 --> 01:30:48.460]  Get out and find signatures people find a place to sign and make sure you vote in November
[01:30:50.700 --> 01:30:53.580]  Yeah, we came really close last year like
[01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:59.340]  Stupidly close and you know it's funny like I have friends in
[01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:04.820]  Florida who would just complain about the fact that it didn't get legalized and I'd be like oh well like who did you vote for
[01:31:04.820 --> 01:31:08.020]  And they're like I didn't know I'm like what right what you're up. You're upset
[01:31:08.860 --> 01:31:12.380]  Right like you actually got to get out on Election Day. It's really not that hard
[01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:18.900]  Not at all if you think your vote doesn't matter the only way your vote doesn't matter is if you don't vote absolutely
[01:31:19.420 --> 01:31:21.420]  You're yeah
[01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:23.660]  Shout out to voting okay, so
[01:31:26.340 --> 01:31:31.420]  So that's Florida Maine Maine you guys might be vote non-legalization
[01:31:33.140 --> 01:31:38.240]  The article I brought found on Maine didn't list whether it was legislative or a valid initiative
[01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:43.540]  It kind of made it sound like it was already on the ballot in 2016, but if you live in Maine you need to google it
[01:31:44.860 --> 01:31:46.180]  Massachusetts
[01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:54.180]  Legislative efforts are underway for decriminalization that would include legal possession so it would be legal to possess a certain amount of marijuana
[01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:59.880]  But it's just decriminalization which means it's still sold from a black market
[01:32:00.620 --> 01:32:04.340]  No, no taxes. No regulations. No lab testing none of that
[01:32:05.020 --> 01:32:07.940]  And there's a group in Massachusetts looking to put
[01:32:08.580 --> 01:32:11.860]  Full legalization on the ballot and they're collecting signatures
[01:32:12.580 --> 01:32:15.380]  In Michigan there's a group collecting signatures
[01:32:16.380 --> 01:32:21.860]  For full legalization including a 12-plant home grow which would be double here in Colorado
[01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:27.080]  Michigan folks I definitely look get out and find a place to sign that petition
[01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:32.460]  Missouri one groups collecting signatures for a legalization effort
[01:32:33.540 --> 01:32:35.540]  They look pretty good
[01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:38.580]  But it's gonna take people turning out to vote for it
[01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:41.900]  In Nevada legalization will be on the ballot
[01:32:42.540 --> 01:32:47.620]  Folks in Missouri started sorry to jump in there. I know those folks in Missouri shout out to Daryl and his wife Trish
[01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:52.420]  Those are the folks running the movement out there a couple weeks ago nice
[01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:59.220]  Rhode Island in Vermont both have legislative efforts for legalization underway
[01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:07.380]  And then I didn't collect any detailed notes on the medical efforts. I'm surprised to see, Mississippi on there
[01:33:08.140 --> 01:33:11.420]  And Ohio still reeling from that major loss
[01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:14.020]  last November
[01:33:14.020 --> 01:33:17.780]  So it doesn't surprise me that they're working on medical
[01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:21.140]  instead of another full legalization effort
[01:33:22.340 --> 01:33:23.940]  yeah, that's
[01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:31.180]  Those are the ones that are for sure already have major legalization groups or legislative efforts to legalize marijuana
[01:33:31.780 --> 01:33:35.860]  if you heard your state on the list, you either need to get out and sign that petition or
[01:33:36.740 --> 01:33:42.820]  Hop on Google real quick look up who your elected representative is for your area for your state legislature
[01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:50.260]  You need to give that person a call or email them if you're shy at all or email them. It's super super simple
[01:33:51.140 --> 01:33:55.700]  Write them a little letter and email dear mr.. So-and-so. I'm one of your voters
[01:33:55.900 --> 01:33:58.780]  I'd like you to vote yes on legalizing marijuana
[01:33:58.780 --> 01:34:04.220]  That's all you have to say if you want to get in and start making the arguments for them and helping them with that part
[01:34:04.220 --> 01:34:06.940]  Of it too. You can in your email. You don't have to be windy
[01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:10.980]  Hi, mr. So-and-so, please vote yes on this. Thank you
[01:34:10.980 --> 01:34:15.500]  That's all you need to write the more people they hear that from the more likely they are to vote for you
[01:34:16.220 --> 01:34:19.980]  To vote for what you're asking to vote for so take the time and do it
[01:34:20.460 --> 01:34:24.540]  If you're a state where it's got you need signatures gathered to get it on the ballot
[01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:29.340]  If the state requires a hundred thousand signatures collect three hundred thousand
[01:34:30.180 --> 01:34:33.940]  When you sign the petition make sure that the petition signer knows that shit
[01:34:34.500 --> 01:34:40.960]  I see efforts fail to make the ballot every year because they needed a hundred thousand they turn in fifty
[01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:43.860]  150,000 and then the state decertifies
[01:34:44.420 --> 01:34:46.420]  80,000 and they're short
[01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:49.300]  That's happening in Maine right now
[01:34:50.460 --> 01:34:52.700]  And I think in Ohio as well
[01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:54.380]  so
[01:34:54.380 --> 01:35:02.060]  When you're gathering signatures for marijuana, you need you need to gather triple the signatures like it's incredibly difficult to get this stuff on the ballot
[01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:04.740]  for a ballot initiative
[01:35:05.100 --> 01:35:10.740]  But it's doable if you do it, right? That's how Colorado did it. That's how a number of the other legal and medical states have done
[01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:14.420]  Awesome that's really cool
[01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:17.820]  So in this upcoming election, which candidates?
[01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:19.860]  Does it look like?
[01:35:19.860 --> 01:35:27.260]  Will have the most positive influence on the cannabis industry if they're elected into office by far Bernie by miles
[01:35:28.220 --> 01:35:33.620]  A distant second would be Hillary who will probably continue the nonsense. We're dealing with now from Obama
[01:35:35.180 --> 01:35:38.380]  Most of the Republican candidates are either indifferent
[01:35:39.540 --> 01:35:44.380]  most are all of the candidates at this point that had outright said that they would use their
[01:35:44.500 --> 01:35:48.900]  Position as president to come in and shut down what we're doing in Colorado and Washington and Oregon
[01:35:49.540 --> 01:35:51.540]  And now Alaska
[01:35:51.660 --> 01:35:54.180]  They're off. They've dropped out of the race
[01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:59.140]  So that's done. We've gotten past that point in this election
[01:35:59.140 --> 01:36:03.140]  That's a really good thing to know that at this point like none of the candidates that are on there
[01:36:03.140 --> 01:36:07.540]  We'll try to shut it down. Yeah, well, none of them have pledged to so far. Okay
[01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:16.140]  Given the nature of politics that in especially this fucking year. It's saying that it hasn't happened yet is a really safe bet
[01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:19.220]  God only knows where the elections gonna go this year
[01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:23.460]  If you thought politics were boring, you're not watching the right news shows
[01:36:23.460 --> 01:36:28.680]  I I don't I'm I can't say that I can't out loud say that I endorse any specific candidate
[01:36:28.980 --> 01:36:34.300]  But but if you were going to vote only based on cannabis, you got a vote on burn one
[01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:38.240]  That's definitely who you'd go for if you're gonna vote just on cannabis laws
[01:36:38.260 --> 01:36:44.300]  That dude used to go to Grateful Dead shows that dude protested it so many if if all those images I've seen they're totally true
[01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:50.140]  They're checked by major media outlets, but here's the thing if you want to vote for Bernie in November
[01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:52.420]  You need to vote for Bernie now
[01:36:53.660 --> 01:36:56.620]  Odds are your state already had its primary caucus
[01:36:57.100 --> 01:36:59.100]  If it hasn't yet
[01:36:59.100 --> 01:37:05.780]  Your ass needs to get in front of computer right now and Google what you have to do to participate in your caucus
[01:37:06.100 --> 01:37:09.860]  The odds are you're already locked out because you didn't do this a month ago
[01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:14.300]  But that's not true in like half of the upcoming states or more
[01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:19.620]  So if you want a chance to vote for Bernie in November, you need to get out and vote for him now
[01:37:21.380 --> 01:37:24.940]  It just it has to happen for him to get the Democratic nomination
[01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:30.900]  It's gonna be a lot of work and a lot of people turn it out who don't usually turn out and that's your fan base
[01:37:33.700 --> 01:37:38.020]  Bernie in November, it's you got to get out now. All right, and
[01:37:39.020 --> 01:37:43.020]  Most some states have primary votes where you just go vote like you do in November
[01:37:44.100 --> 01:37:50.340]  Each states different that's part of the what you're googling to see how to participate in it. It's not hard. It's not difficult
[01:37:50.340 --> 01:37:55.740]  It won't be that big pain in the ass and it'll have major repercussions in November. So get out and do it
[01:37:56.660 --> 01:38:00.580]  You can't bitch if you don't vote. No, you can't. All right, so
[01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:02.900]  We were talking about
[01:38:02.980 --> 01:38:08.860]  The candidates that are most pro cannabis, I think we can all agree that it's mr. Bernie Sanders, right?
[01:38:11.260 --> 01:38:16.420]  So if Bernie gets elected into office, what does that mean for legal weed like across the nation?
[01:38:17.020 --> 01:38:21.420]  Well his campaign pledge so far only goes so far as to say he won't
[01:38:22.660 --> 01:38:25.580]  Interrupt the experiments going on in legal states
[01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:27.700]  He's
[01:38:28.220 --> 01:38:33.860]  Very set against the war on drugs. I think he's talked about decriminal or legalizing it federally
[01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:37.500]  On the record this campaign
[01:38:38.860 --> 01:38:40.860]  It's
[01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:44.820]  As a president he's got a couple of different options he could take
[01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:48.460]  The president could sign an executive order
[01:38:49.140 --> 01:38:53.140]  Which would legalize it federally sort of?
[01:38:54.140 --> 01:38:57.740]  Executive orders aren't federal law necessarily like there's a lot of
[01:38:58.620 --> 01:39:01.140]  contentious politics involved with executive orders
[01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:06.880]  But the executive order isn't a change in federal law that would still mean for marijuana is illegal federally
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:10.100]  It's just the president signed an order saying who don't care
[01:39:12.380 --> 01:39:16.260]  What we really need to happen is an act of Congress
[01:39:16.940 --> 01:39:20.900]  And where the who's president matters there is because they get to a
[01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:25.060]  Bully pulpit is what they call it where the president gets to say. Hey guys in Congress
[01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:28.180]  It would be a really good idea if you worked on this
[01:39:29.020 --> 01:39:33.740]  And they do it all the time with all kinds of different shit, and there's no reason they can't do it with all right
[01:39:33.740 --> 01:39:38.220]  You guys we're gonna figure out how to legalize marijuana this year do this this and this get on it
[01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:45.380]  And like he doesn't get it tell him like what to do like a your boss does it work, but it's similar
[01:39:46.820 --> 01:39:51.940]  With Obama they just kind of look at him and nod their heads and then half of the people elected to
[01:39:52.340 --> 01:39:55.740]  Represent us have chose to do nothing for the last nine years, and it's been a fucking problem
[01:39:57.100 --> 01:39:59.100]  but
[01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:03.500]  Getting Bernie into the presidency and paying attention to Senate races
[01:40:04.340 --> 01:40:08.300]  This year major shifts in politics can happen
[01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:11.020]  over half of our elected
[01:40:11.060 --> 01:40:16.740]  Representatives in Washington DC right now are up for election if we fire that many of them and replace them with
[01:40:17.140 --> 01:40:19.940]  quality candidates that are even mildly pro-cannabis
[01:40:21.220 --> 01:40:24.340]  2016 could be a monumental year for legal marijuana
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:35.800]  The podcast just accidentally full-on endorsed Bernie Sanders
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  If you're a pro marijuana
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:44.400]  That's the logical rational choice yeah, definitely so there's a lot of mostly then there's dark
[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:46.480]  Yeah, there are a lot of arguments to be made after that
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:51.520]  But right that's what you're looking at 100% is cannabis then you that's where your money and vote would go
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:57.400]  I'm very much not a one-issue voter, but marijuana legalization is very near and dear to my heart
[01:40:58.360 --> 01:41:02.320]  And I can see voting in an election like this based purely on that
[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:07.000]  Well my life is ninety eight point seven percent
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  Funded by the
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000]  legalization of cannabis right
[01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:15.680]  That's only like 25% true for me, but like yeah
[01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:21.120]  That's zero percent true for me, but I said still like a big aspect for why I'm voting to be honest
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:26.520]  It's I've studied this for so long in just having it prohibit pro
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:28.600]  prohibited
[01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:34.880]  Just that concept in our law has ruined so many things. It's infected every part of American life from
[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:43.360]  Politics to medicine to how we interact with each other our neighbors the police how they how the police interact with us
[01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:47.360]  It's it's just poisoned everything
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:55.160]  It's touched and it's touched everything and it has to stop and it stops this election year when people under 30 turn out and vote
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:41:59.360]  Which will hopefully happen a lot more this year than it has in the past
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:05.120]  We've seen so many people turning out for caucuses and voting pro Bernie in a lot of places
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:07.920]  Yeah, we've been setting records for caucus attendances
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:13.000]  Caucus attendance yeah, so it's there are gonna be a lot of new voters out there this year
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:17.400]  There are there are more than usual energized, but we've seen this before
[01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:22.000]  If you're a political junkie they refer to it as getting do caucused
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:29.080]  It's a guy who could have been president and everybody thought he was gonna be and all the college kids were gonna vote for him
[01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:33.160]  And then he lost in a fucking landslide to a nightmare of a Republican
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:36.720]  And it happens
[01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:42.960]  Bernie's really really popular and he could he could lose in a landslide to the Republican nominee
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:45.560]  whoever that ends up being God don't let it be Trump and
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:52.160]  He could lose to Hillary in the primary and we could be voting Hillary versus somebody and
[01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:55.600]  Then what that means for legalization is very different
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:58.800]  Trump just is fucking crazy, dude
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:04.360]  We're fucking living a Mad Max movie inside for years
[01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:13.320]  I've already and I know everyone says this but like I've already let it be very well known that I will probably
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:17.680]  Leave the United States. I have family in England. I
[01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:23.920]  You've got a lifeboat. You gotta get out. Yeah, I might I might actually jump ship
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:30.360]  I mean, I've always wanted to go backpacking and like do the Europe thing anyways, so like thanks for helping me make that decision, right?
[01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:33.960]  Yeah, yeah, I don't know what I'm gonna do if that dude gets elected
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:39.600]  Yeah, dude, I'm gonna ride the boat till it crumbles. My life will change. That is an absolute thing
[01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:43.920]  Yeah, absolutely. So I guess my next question actually goes to both of you then so
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:46.960]  realistically is
[01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:51.440]  Legalizing marijuana across the nation something we want to see
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:57.200]  I know for myself I can say yes, but I know that my reasons and I guess
[01:43:57.720 --> 01:44:02.440]  I would rather hear both of yours. Don't go for it. You want me to take it first?
[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:11.200]  I'm happy to take it go for it. Yes. It's a great thing for legalization
[01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:17.440]  The people who are doing it right are gonna be able to do it right across the country and
[01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:23.640]  The people that want to come in and take over or come in and corporatize can't compete
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:25.840]  like I
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:29.800]  Don't know any beer drinkers who would be pumped if another scores like came on the market
[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:35.460]  I know a lot of beer drinkers who are pumped regularly about some small craft brewery coming on market
[01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:41.360]  People who build up quality and turn out quality or what we need in this industry
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:44.640]  federal legalization opens up
[01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:48.440]  Dude the lab testing problem goes away overnight, right?
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:55.040]  We can use the same labs to test the cantaloupe the pesticide problem. The pesticide goes over goes out overnight
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:45:00.760]  Immediately the pesticide manufacturers are able to run the studies needed to put cannabis on the label
[01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:07.880]  All the ones that already know they can because it's on the label for tobacco. We'll have those studies done in hours all of the seizure
[01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:13.560]  Studies would be able to be done for all of that medical research and adults that have epilepsy
[01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:20.480]  Terps for tots like I get that Marlboro is gonna come in and plant five or five hundred acres worth of shitty weed and roll
[01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:24.640]  It up and throw it on the shelf at six and a half percent pre-rolled joints
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:30.120]  In a fucking little pack and it's gonna be cute and it's gonna eat a part of the market for people who don't know
[01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:31.680]  Any better, but I don't care
[01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:36.880]  So do you think there's too much benefit if it's completely federally legal and there are places
[01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:42.160]  And I'm gonna compare it to the beer model like you did. There's a cannabis manufacturer. That's the same size as
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:45.240]  Bush or Coors making producing
[01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:47.920]  Mass-produced cannabis
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:52.560]  Free cannabis and then there are still niche gardens like green and healthy wellness and a few others
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:56.680]  There are a few other shops that I totally would shop at and buy their product, right?
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:03.360]  Do you think that those shops are still going to survive with that large market like the Coors type of stores that are coming out?
[01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:04.880]  For sure. Okay
[01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:05.920]  There'll be
[01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:11.880]  There'll be a section of them that get bought up because when when a Marlboro or a Coors or fuck those companies
[01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:17.560]  But you go to I mean, yeah when they step in they don't create from the ground up. They look at you
[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:22.320]  They see what you're doing. They hit you in the face with a check bigger than you've ever imagined you walk away
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:25.400]  They replicate your business model as a franchise
[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:31.560]  And then there's gonna be the people who do this because they love it. They're gonna not sell out
[01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:34.640]  They're gonna slowly expand
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:42.320]  There's a million people who wish they could just hop online and order your seeds that can't because it's not legal
[01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:44.200]  federally
[01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:48.440]  It's a federal offense to mail those to people they can't buy them
[01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:55.840]  Like all that goes away overnight people can just hop online buy your seeds and enjoy life
[01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:58.400]  100% legally without having to worry about shit
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:00.880]  and
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:08.840]  The benefit for the industry sky-high right now there was just report that the legal industry is worth 4.4 billion dollars this year
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:15.400]  It's gonna grow to 40 billion dollars by 2020 if states continue to legalize like they have
[01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:21.840]  The last estimate I read on the black market was Americans are spending 60 billion on marijuana right now
[01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:27.040]  You figure a third or more. That's the black market markup. I
[01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:31.760]  Mean the industry is worth 44 45 billion dollars nationwide
[01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:39.840]  If you're able to export to England every now and again or whatever else is other countries start to legalize and the demand for American
[01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:41.400]  quality cannabis
[01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:43.280]  spreads around the globe
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:45.280]  That growth is exponential
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:51.320]  The idea that you're gonna get squeezed out if you're good at what you're doing and you're a competent business owner is just not there
[01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:54.360]  Mike you ever do a mic drop
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:47:59.600]  Podcast
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:07.480]  That's why I want to choke the fucking stoners against legalization like I see people every day online that are actively lobbying against
[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:15.560]  whatever legalization efforts going on in their area because it legalizes marijuana somewhere in between alcohol and
[01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:18.520]  Tobacco
[01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:20.520]  Not like tomatoes
[01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:22.960]  So like you can only produce so much of it
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:28.880]  If you produce it in your home who you can sell it to or give it away to or not be allowed to sell it to
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:30.240]  That's something I was gonna
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:34.240]  Mention is you got to be careful when you're gonna make the when it goes federally legal
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:41.080]  We have to be careful about what we get like what we ask for because there needs to be certain rules about growing if
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:44.460]  We're all limited to six plants. That's gonna fuck some things up. We need
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:48.760]  Usable numbers more viable plant numbers. We need just a little better rule
[01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:51.840]  So when it comes time we got to be careful that we get the right stuff that we want
[01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:53.760]  It's so weird in Colorado right now
[01:48:53.760 --> 01:49:02.000]  Especially when we're extrapolating to federal legalization because right now those rules really help keep the idiots from fucking this up for all of us
[01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:05.440]  Already we've got major problems
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:09.080]  Mostly PR problems like nobody's been hurt
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:11.680]  but
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:13.680]  massive outdoor grows where
[01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:16.720]  Okay, so a few people have been hurt. That was a fair head shake
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:24.760]  But massive outdoor grows that piss off the neighbors that lead to articles in the press about what bastards we are and how the systems
[01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:26.320]  being manipulated
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:30.240]  All of that leads to major blowback that has political ramifications
[01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:35.280]  Including our area possibly voting to ban the legal marijuana industry this November
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:42.120]  That's a real fucking possibility mainly because there's been a lot of blowback lately about huge outdoor grows
[01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:49.960]  People with the 20 and 30 plant count doing 20 or 30 VW bus size plants in a fucking suburban backyard like a douchebag
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:51.800]  Yeah, that's not allowed
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:58.400]  Nope, and it pisses all the neighbors off and it looks terrible in the press and it's gonna lead to sick kids losing out
[01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:01.600]  On their medicine because caregivers are gonna get quashed here in about five years
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:07.120]  They're already pushing the caregiver model out of the Colorado business plan. It's already going away. Yep
[01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:10.440]  and so
[01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:14.840]  It's really time like if you care about marijuana legalization
[01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:18.800]  Or you want to be part of this industry to really start paying attention and getting involved
[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:24.040]  Because right now everything is happening. It's actually becoming legal
[01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:30.280]  everywhere very slowly, but it's happening like it's we're moving forward every two years and
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:35.160]  If people turn out and vote and the numbers that they can Facebook post
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:37.000]  Um
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:41.520]  Bernie wins in a landslide huge numbers of congressmen get replaced
[01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:47.200]  And we actually make major progress on marijuana law for the first time federally in 80 years
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:51.720]  We can be a part of that revolution. All you got to do is get out there and vote
[01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:53.720]  We already told you who to vote for accidentally
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:50:58.360]  Really didn't intend to endorse a specific candidate
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:03.680]  But if you're your only vote topic is marijuana, you really got a vote for Bernie. Yeah
[01:51:04.560 --> 01:51:08.440]  Well, so then I guess that that kind of leads right there into my next question
[01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:12.560]  what serious changes will occur if
[01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:15.680]  Bernie a pro-marijuana candidate
[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:23.320]  Is elected into office like federally and statewide obviously it'll change the drug classification of it
[01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:26.640]  Which will mean that it'll be able to be studied and all that
[01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:29.040]  The
[01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:33.560]  Change at the federal level is just so huge. We will be able to put our money in a bank
[01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:34.200]  Yep
[01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:39.120]  We've spent 80 years thinking up ways to make it harder to grow weed and
[01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:43.520]  Every single one of those rules is still in place for the legal industry
[01:51:45.080 --> 01:51:51.360]  And changing the federal law lets us change all of those the banking the lab testing the packaging
[01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:53.920]  requirements the state line rules I
[01:51:54.800 --> 01:51:59.320]  Get five calls a week at the shop about people wondering where the buy now button is on our website
[01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:08.680]  Like I I get it like you buy everything online now like you're probably not gonna be buying weed online now anytime soon but
[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:17.840]  It should be there like everything else and it can be if it's federally legal but just changing who the president is
[01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:26.080]  It's sort of like the first step and that's not how we get this battle won necessarily that's that's the next best step
[01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:31.400]  The real change happens like regardless of who gets elected the next election
[01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:36.000]  Calling your state legislatures calling your state senators
[01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:38.920]  Just google it figure out who they are
[01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:42.720]  It's their job to listen to bullshit when people call them and you didn't the Emirates stuff
[01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:46.640]  That's their job is for people that live from whatever area of the country
[01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:49.520]  They're from call and talk to them and it's their job to listen
[01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:55.680]  And then it's their job to go pass laws based on how many people call them that week and said vote yes or vote no
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:53:01.800]  So literally this stuff matters. There are a number of areas cities towns
[01:53:02.760 --> 01:53:07.400]  Counties that are voting on marijuana legalization far ahead of their states
[01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:12.960]  I just saw New Orleans to criminalized it fucking Louisiana's never gonna
[01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:21.240]  But New Orleans just passed a law maybe not full decriminalization, but they just did some sentencing reform guidelines
[01:53:22.120 --> 01:53:28.120]  I've been posting a story all week of about a dude who got 13 years for two joints in New Orleans. That's ridiculous
[01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:35.520]  Yep, it's part of there's three strikes in your fuck law. There's enough hash on this table to lock up everyone in New Orleans. Yep
[01:53:36.280 --> 01:53:41.600]  Miami Florida decriminalized it last year didn't or this year earlier this I think so. Yeah
[01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:46.600]  Yeah, I think anything cities towns and counties everywhere are and they're doing it because
[01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:49.280]  the local officials in those areas
[01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:57.280]  Got swamped with pro-marijuana supporters calling. Hey, I'm a voter in your district. I'm pro-marijuana. Let's legalize it in the city
[01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:05.280]  Enough people called enough people got active and that's what everybody listening to the show needs to do if you live in another country
[01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:11.720]  Unless it's like North Korea odds are you've got a system of representative government of some sort
[01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:15.920]  You can do a lot of this too because I know we've got a listeners in Australia
[01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:18.320]  You're listening from North Korea. Please send me a tweet
[01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:23.360]  Seriously I'd love to know if you're listening in Korea
[01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:28.960]  Podcast on Twitter. I want to know and also huge shout out to our supporter in Australia
[01:54:29.440 --> 01:54:34.400]  I'm sure we've got several but we've got one guy out there. That is a huge supporter. What's up? My Rasta friend
[01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:36.400]  Thanks for listening to the show
[01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:42.320]  But yeah get involved get active because there's a lot you can do even on a local level if you live in a state that's
[01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:46.080]  Never gonna legalize it. You might live in a city that will
[01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:49.160]  Austin
[01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:54.360]  So in your opinion out of the states that have
[01:54:54.760 --> 01:54:56.760]  legalized marijuana already
[01:54:56.960 --> 01:55:01.240]  Which state is doing it right in the way of laws like who?
[01:55:01.480 --> 01:55:07.980]  Has a good set of laws put in place to make a cannabis industry actually grow and not have issues
[01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:12.600]  None of them are perfect yet, but I tend to
[01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:18.920]  It might be biased, but I took a quick glance at the rules again today, and I vote Colorado by a mile
[01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:27.120]  Washington's drastically overtaxing marijuana and has caused all sorts of price issues and issues industry-wide
[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:34.600]  Between the city that state the county though in the federal sales taxes that the legal marijuana industry pays
[01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:41.720]  Having a statewide tax rate of 30 35 percent is enough to keep the shop from being able to profit at all
[01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:47.720]  And that's terrible for the industry. It's in on the black market. Yep. If in if the shops can't profit
[01:55:49.720 --> 01:55:52.760]  They can't pay their people what they're worth they can't provide insurance
[01:55:53.720 --> 01:55:58.100]  They can't reinvest in their business, and there's no reason to get involved in it
[01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:02.640]  Just stay in the black market the black market will be fine. Just like it was last year
[01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:09.800]  It always exists, it's never going away, I mean Oregon's got its own issues
[01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:14.160]  The whole new set of issues as yesterday
[01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:21.160]  But Colorado is far from perfect to weird social clubs are a very gray area in our law
[01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:26.920]  Some areas allow them no area has shops up and running where they're allowed
[01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:31.440]  Colorado Springs just voted to ban all the shops
[01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:34.240]  But gave them eight years to shut down
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:40.000]  Years so yeah, they're too dangerous to allow to continue to exist so they have to shut them down
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:45.080]  But they gave them eight years actually they actually said that they're going to vote again within that eight years
[01:56:45.080 --> 01:56:48.120]  Oh, they're probably gonna vote at least eight times. Yes
[01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:50.240]  Hopefully we can turn it around there
[01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:56.480]  So when you guys are writing the rules in your state or city or a county or whatever it may be on your island
[01:56:56.880 --> 01:57:02.760]  In your bubble when you're making the rules for your cannabis laws be sure to include some sort of
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:08.400]  Way to consume that cannabis legally and safely with your friends there are places to go to drink alcohol
[01:57:08.680 --> 01:57:09.800]  We can all go gather
[01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:15.300]  I can name 12 places within five minutes of here that we can all go get drunk until we fucking die
[01:57:15.540 --> 01:57:21.220]  But there's nowhere that we get other than right here at this table that we can all congregate and safely consume cannabis without any problems
[01:57:23.260 --> 01:57:27.620]  We take it as kind of a given but there's a huge contingent of people out there that
[01:57:28.100 --> 01:57:31.740]  Want no rules, and they think that's possible
[01:57:32.260 --> 01:57:33.940]  And it's not
[01:57:33.940 --> 01:57:42.420]  It's marijuana might be the most safe intoxicant known to mankind it might be the most beneficial plant known to mankind
[01:57:43.420 --> 01:57:50.900]  None of that means you're gonna legalize it to be produced in the home at any amount with no regulation or no rules
[01:57:51.180 --> 01:57:55.400]  Is to how or where it can be grown like you'll never be able to grow like tomatoes
[01:57:56.900 --> 01:58:00.900]  At best you'll be able to produce it like homebrew alcohol works
[01:58:02.100 --> 01:58:03.380]  and
[01:58:03.380 --> 01:58:05.580]  We need some of those rules honestly
[01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:10.760]  With the abuses we see just in the legal states that are going now like
[01:58:11.020 --> 01:58:16.260]  There are idiots everywhere like and we kind of have to set up the rules for the slowest link
[01:58:16.260 --> 01:58:21.260]  You know what? I mean? Like there was the guy growing eight foot tall trees in his backyard here in our neighborhood
[01:58:21.260 --> 01:58:26.700]  Yeah, and some kids tried to steal his trees and he shot them like thank God. It was a fucking pellet gun
[01:58:27.300 --> 01:58:32.740]  but there's been others their home invasion robberies because they've got a ridiculous grow going and
[01:58:33.100 --> 01:58:39.580]  Yeah, it's legal here dude congrats bro, but it's not legal to stayed over it's in fact worth eight thousand a pound and
[01:58:40.060 --> 01:58:44.460]  You've got four hundred thousand dollars worth of marijuana in your suburban backyard in the ghetto
[01:58:45.020 --> 01:58:46.220]  like
[01:58:46.220 --> 01:58:49.340]  That's your life like 12 times over bro. What were you thinking?
[01:58:51.220 --> 01:58:56.020]  Like not only did you put yourself at risk everybody else in your house at risk your neighbors at risk
[01:58:57.060 --> 01:59:00.300]  But you shot the whole movement in the foot at the same time
[01:59:01.260 --> 01:59:06.700]  And I honestly don't want my fucking kid climbing over your fence and stealing your weed when he's 12 like
[01:59:07.460 --> 01:59:14.100]  Fucking hassle bums like I had to do with boost and I was getting gas today and a dude who looked well
[01:59:14.100 --> 01:59:18.300]  Like kid decent shoes and looked clean. He's like bro. You got an extra couple balls
[01:59:22.820 --> 01:59:27.060]  Don't even know what to think dude, I was too big ask right it's spare change
[01:59:27.060 --> 01:59:31.020]  Not do you have $47 a couple of extra bowls like
[01:59:32.100 --> 01:59:35.740]  Like if I had a road show to hooked you up doing throwing on a couple of extra bowl
[01:59:35.740 --> 01:59:40.660]  I don't know. Maybe if I had a nugget might have thrown it his way. Yeah, but a nug is a bowl, right?
[01:59:40.660 --> 01:59:43.900]  I mean like or I guess it's a yeah, I thought about offering him
[01:59:43.900 --> 01:59:47.180]  I was like you should just get in the car and take the biggest fucking dab
[01:59:47.180 --> 01:59:51.500]  You've ever had is what I thought about doing to the kid, but it wasn't the right time
[01:59:52.500 --> 01:59:55.460]  Didn't seem right. Yeah didn't seem right at all
[01:59:57.700 --> 02:00:03.380]  Got more questions for white Mike. There's a couple more questions on the list. Yeah. Oh, yeah, Mike got the list also
[02:00:03.380 --> 02:00:05.380]  Yeah, everyone's got the list
[02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:09.300]  Okay, so what other states
[02:00:09.340 --> 02:00:14.820]  Accept other states medical cards. Okay, the only state that does they call that reciprocity?
[02:00:14.900 --> 02:00:17.540]  The only state that I know that does that is Nevada
[02:00:17.540 --> 02:00:21.860]  Okay, and they accept all other states are just a select as far as I'm aware
[02:00:22.220 --> 02:00:27.580]  Nevada's medical marijuana dispensaries accept medical marijuana cards from all other states
[02:00:28.300 --> 02:00:30.300]  Which is great for the medical marijuana
[02:00:30.860 --> 02:00:33.380]  industry in Nevada because last I checked they had like
[02:00:33.620 --> 02:00:39.620]  2010 or 14,000 patients that just changed a lot of cool things because one of our very good friends is getting married there on the
[02:00:39.620 --> 02:00:42.220]  23rd of July and I've been invited to their wedding nice
[02:00:42.220 --> 02:00:46.380]  And so that means that I can travel and I can stop at a dispensary and I can pick up some products
[02:00:46.380 --> 02:00:50.400]  Yep, I haven't wanted to go to Vegas since I was like 24
[02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:57.020]  And I suddenly it's back on the list of the to-dos shout out to Arnie and Ravay congrats on the wedding you guys
[02:00:58.080 --> 02:01:05.320]  I've never been to Vegas so that might have to happen soon. It's it's you definitely do it a couple of times before you die
[02:01:06.600 --> 02:01:08.600]  Everybody that I'll be in Vegas on July 23rd
[02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:18.280]  Drinking and legal weed or legal access to my medical marijuana to be more specific
[02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:24.680]  Do you think do you think being high will improve your gambling? Oh by miles? Yeah, that's yellow. Yeah
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:31.160]  That's what I was gonna say about the smoke smoking clubs thing like that's a huge thing for me because I don't drink
[02:01:31.160 --> 02:01:35.360]  I haven't drank in maybe two or three years now like I don't really do anything else
[02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:40.200]  So smoking is really important to me and like being able to have somewhere to go and to do that is like really important
[02:01:40.200 --> 02:01:45.040]  So knowing that I can go to other states and like consume cannabis without having any issues or anything. It's like a really
[02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:51.760]  I think it was Matt that said on a past episode that they made bars so that you don't have people drinking on the streets
[02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:55.480]  All day, they need to make cannabis social clubs so that we're not out in our car trying to dab
[02:01:55.720 --> 02:02:00.720]  The fucking Safeway parking lot right and then we get a DUI right? Yeah
[02:02:03.640 --> 02:02:05.640]  Or some stupid shit, right
[02:02:06.820 --> 02:02:11.040]  Legalization doesn't exist in a vacuum like it has to be practicable just like everything else
[02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:14.320]  And there are a lot of people who live in places where they can't smoke
[02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:19.540]  There are a lot of people who live in situations where they can't smoke. I'm about to be in one
[02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:23.520]  And it gets cold fucking in Colorado during the winter
[02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:29.240]  And so you've you know you need places to go where you can legally consume
[02:02:29.240 --> 02:02:32.040]  You don't want to be standing out in an alley if you don't have to be
[02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:35.840]  And there's no reason to have that be the legal consumption method
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:40.840]  I fucking hate tourists or telling tourists that just go to the back the hotel parking lot
[02:02:41.200 --> 02:02:43.640]  Like we should have a better answer than that, right?
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:50.400]  Smoke out your car. Yeah, I love the points that got made on that show that last show a candy Canyon
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:57.400]  About like we've got kids now like I don't necessarily want to explain that like I want to do that on my own time
[02:02:58.120 --> 02:03:01.720]  I don't want to have to explain that shit in the park or fucking
[02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:08.640]  Anywhere else like yes signs are one thing like what are those guys doing over there like that looks fun
[02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:14.120]  Should we go do that dad like I want to skip those questions for as long as possible and if there are consumption clubs
[02:03:14.640 --> 02:03:18.240]  That conversation really comes up like that if I'm at a consumption club
[02:03:19.640 --> 02:03:25.960]  Yeah, right, and it's fucking on me because I've got my 12 year old the consumption club like I'm the douchebag in that situation
[02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:27.600]  I think I smoking weed
[02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:29.600]  You guys they will not let
[02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:32.560]  You can fully have your 12 year old in the bar
[02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:43.040]  It's really got to be hard to telling people that about the hotel because you're putting them at risk too
[02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:46.120]  Because if a cop were to catch them smoking out in the open
[02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:50.560]  They get you know, they still get a fine or whatever. It is here in college
[02:03:50.560 --> 02:03:55.240]  We had a friend who got caught smoking in a parking lot. He didn't have anywhere to be for a little while
[02:03:55.240 --> 02:04:00.160]  He parked underneath the stoplight or the just the light the street light there and was chilling out
[02:04:00.400 --> 02:04:05.360]  Loaded himself up a bowl and took a couple of puffs off the bowl as he was blown out of hit cop walked up to
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:06.880]  His window and knocked on his window
[02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:11.640]  He had no choice but to roll down the window and let the smoke billow onto the cops face and he just wrote all he
[02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:15.360]  Did was write him an illegal possession of cannabis ticket and he kind of chewed him out
[02:04:15.360 --> 02:04:18.520]  He's like you can't fucking smoke here and my buddy's like I was just waiting
[02:04:18.520 --> 02:04:21.320]  I didn't have anywhere to be and he's like, I don't care. You can't fucking smoke here
[02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:23.160]  like
[02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:25.160]  That was our buddies fault
[02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:28.280]  Yeah, it was 44 spot. Shout out to 44, right?
[02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:33.560]  But if there had been a place for him to go where he could safely consume cannabis 44 and 2
[02:04:33.560 --> 02:04:40.240]  If there have been a place for him to like safely consume cannabis, you know that wouldn't have happened that whole situation wouldn't happen
[02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:44.400]  Happened but for our friend 44 and 2 that still would have happened that way
[02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:47.440]  but yeah
[02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:54.080]  There should be more hotels that cater to the level of tourists coming through Colorado and they just that part of the industry hasn't caught
[02:04:54.080 --> 02:04:55.640]  up yet
[02:04:55.640 --> 02:04:59.480]  And I mean come consumption clubs solve a couple hundred different questions
[02:04:59.480 --> 02:05:05.600]  And I mean come consumption clubs solve a couple hundred different questions about how legal marijuana works
[02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:11.240]  There's a dispensary in Manitou Springs since the dispensary I work for is not a recreational store. It's a medical only
[02:05:11.240 --> 02:05:14.560]  I can tell you about Emerald Fields in Manitou Springs
[02:05:14.560 --> 02:05:21.320]  If you're gonna be in the Manitou Springs, Colorado Springs area and you're looking for recreational cannabis, I would send you to Emerald Fields
[02:05:21.320 --> 02:05:24.320]  I like the vibe and the experience of the place. It was unlike any other
[02:05:25.240 --> 02:05:29.920]  Recreational dispensary I've ever been to the place was really fucking cool had a neat vibe to it
[02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:35.560]  It's a little overpriced because it's recreational cannabis and I'm used to paying member pricing over at green and healthy
[02:05:35.680 --> 02:05:37.760]  But the place was cool as shit. Check it out
[02:05:38.280 --> 02:05:44.300]  Right down the street. There is a 420 friendly hotel in Manitou. They advertise that they are 420 friendly
[02:05:44.300 --> 02:05:45.400]  So they're not gonna kick you out
[02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:50.640]  I don't know if you can smoke in the rooms or if they've got like a designated 420 area
[02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:54.020]  But it advertises 420 friendly on the sign
[02:05:54.020 --> 02:05:57.560]  It's basically if you're coming to Colorado and you plan to consume cannabis
[02:05:57.680 --> 02:06:03.600]  The best thing you can do is call around to several different hotels and just a straight-up asking what their marijuana policy is
[02:06:03.600 --> 02:06:05.600]  Don't use euphemisms
[02:06:06.200 --> 02:06:10.080]  Don't let there be any confusion. They've gotten this phone call eight times today
[02:06:10.480 --> 02:06:13.840]  The person on the other end should just give you a rote response
[02:06:13.840 --> 02:06:20.120]  If anybody from Emerald Fields or that hotel heard any of that you can kindly send an email
[02:06:20.400 --> 02:06:22.400]  With a check in it
[02:06:25.560 --> 02:06:32.260]  But yeah, just call and ask what's your marijuana policy they'll tell you that they'll kick you out for consuming on property at a story
[02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:36.920]  They'll tell you that they don't allow you to consume inside, but they have a smoking pad
[02:06:36.920 --> 02:06:41.120]  There is one or one hotel on the south side of Pueblo that is cannabis friendly
[02:06:41.120 --> 02:06:44.560]  But I cannot recall which hotel house right now the one I used to send people to
[02:06:44.760 --> 02:06:49.640]  I sent a guy to the other night and I got a call back maybe 45 minutes after I had this conversation
[02:06:49.800 --> 02:06:53.560]  He was like no, they said they're not anymore and he yelled at me and I had to leave
[02:06:54.280 --> 02:06:56.280]  And I felt really bad
[02:06:56.960 --> 02:06:58.960]  Yep, sorry, dude
[02:06:59.160 --> 02:07:01.160]  my bad, but yeah, it's uh
[02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:06.000]  There's just some Colorado's got the best that allows so far in my opinion
[02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:10.680]  But we've still got some serious serious holes in our law right now that need to be fixed
[02:07:10.680 --> 02:07:13.240]  There are a couple of classier hotels in Denver
[02:07:13.240 --> 02:07:17.620]  I don't know if I even want to say the names of the places wouldn't but I if you
[02:07:17.700 --> 02:07:22.420]  We go for the cannabis cup and when we go for the cup we get expensive hotels not to be an asshole
[02:07:22.420 --> 02:07:26.100]  Yeah, when we go to Denver, we would go get fucking high-end hotels
[02:07:26.100 --> 02:07:30.660]  Yeah, we would be kind of assholes about it neat eat lunch on the balcony and well, that's a word trip
[02:07:30.660 --> 02:07:32.660]  Spoil yourself a little yeah
[02:07:32.660 --> 02:07:33.940]  and so
[02:07:33.940 --> 02:07:38.060]  If you told the people at the desk be like, so what's the the smoking fee?
[02:07:38.060 --> 02:07:40.980]  They're like it's $500 here. We're gonna be here for three days
[02:07:40.980 --> 02:07:45.500]  There's eight of us thrown out like 40 bucks each or 50 bucks each or was I don't know?
[02:07:45.580 --> 02:07:50.260]  Math this quickly while I'm talking about it, but if we divide that we'll divided the smoking fee
[02:07:50.260 --> 02:07:53.260]  Like can you just bill us for that not fuck with us and like, okay
[02:07:53.420 --> 02:07:56.500]  They just let us pay the $500 smoking what they were gonna charge us
[02:07:56.500 --> 02:08:02.320]  That's three on a paid in advance like we're going to smoke this bitch out. They're like, okay, they just let us do that
[02:08:03.340 --> 02:08:09.460]  There are other hotels that won't let you smoke them out. But some of or all of their rooms have balconies
[02:08:10.300 --> 02:08:14.560]  And some of them are more or less lenient with just go out on the balcony and puff
[02:08:14.680 --> 02:08:16.000]  Yeah
[02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:19.120]  Others have straight-up told people just go to the back of our parking lot
[02:08:20.160 --> 02:08:22.640]  And every time I drive by one of them
[02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:28.780]  I see like three people standing in this parking lot just in the back corner smoke the warwick has killer balconies
[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.640]  That's all I'm saying the balcony at the warwick is rad
[02:08:32.680 --> 02:08:38.980]  There's actually a little smoking club in Denver called I bake or I bake. Yes, I bake
[02:08:38.980 --> 02:08:41.680]  Yes, have you guys ever been I haven't been
[02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:44.040]  But have not been there, okay
[02:08:44.040 --> 02:08:51.720]  So I visited Colorado twice before I moved out here and both times that I visited I tried to go there
[02:08:51.720 --> 02:08:55.840]  and like they don't open until noon or something like that, so my
[02:08:56.480 --> 02:08:59.040]  Overly excited woke up too early, you know
[02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:04.760]  So I was not prepared for something to not be open till noon and I was not ready to wait to smoke a blunt
[02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:07.240]  So I smoked in a parking lot. But anyways
[02:09:07.800 --> 02:09:14.700]  But yeah, so I have never actually been there but apparently that is a really chill like no entry fee
[02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:21.720]  No, nothing place. So if you're ever in Denver and you want to check that place out that uh, that's a cannabis smoking club
[02:09:21.720 --> 02:09:23.720]  I bake you can hit my PayPal
[02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:31.620]  There's a there's a bunch of speakeasy style cannabis clubs around Denver and other cities in Colorado. They're just
[02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:36.420]  If they were legal, it'd be simple. You know, I shout out the Cana Canyon all the time
[02:09:36.420 --> 02:09:42.900]  I really had fun at the Dab Lounge a couple of weekends ago with Steve Dufino doing the veteran farmers Alliance
[02:09:42.900 --> 02:09:48.180]  And then I went to this speakeasy. It's the 420 speakeasy. It's next door to the Lazy Lion
[02:09:48.300 --> 02:09:54.140]  It's a completely different vibe than both places. It's got a big stage and there was a band playing and there are pool tables
[02:09:54.940 --> 02:09:59.260]  There are a lot of options. I really enjoyed all three of those clubs on a different level
[02:09:59.260 --> 02:10:06.020]  I just prefer the Cana Canyon because it's got this way to hardwood floors leather couches. It's just classy as fuck. It's funny
[02:10:06.020 --> 02:10:10.220]  I always explain the smoking clubs in Colorado Springs if you're trying to
[02:10:10.900 --> 02:10:14.340]  Go with people who you're trying to I wouldn't even say distract
[02:10:14.340 --> 02:10:17.500]  But there's a lot of TVs and a lot of things to do at the lion
[02:10:17.500 --> 02:10:19.500]  So you don't necessarily have to interact with people
[02:10:20.340 --> 02:10:22.420]  The dab lounge is the same way, right?
[02:10:22.420 --> 02:10:28.180]  and but Cana Canyon is where you go with your like true friends to like sit down and talk and actually have like a real
[02:10:28.460 --> 02:10:32.080]  Conversation because there really isn't any TVs or some music and stuff
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:37.480]  So you really go there for the atmosphere and the cannabis everything music is kept in a real quiet level and yeah
[02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:42.200]  The hostess is usually Camille and she's amazing bring you bottles of water if you
[02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:46.320]  Right and like that's what I want
[02:10:46.840 --> 02:10:50.960]  What I hope to see like all over Colorado slowly start to spring up is
[02:10:51.640 --> 02:10:55.900]  Places where people can go with their friends socialize a little bit consume some cannabis
[02:10:56.740 --> 02:11:00.320]  Safely out of public view like away from people who aren't interested in it
[02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:01.760]  I mean, it's just that simple
[02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:05.040]  It's someplace to wait for the fucking cab of the uber you know where people can safely
[02:11:05.040 --> 02:11:10.840]  Consume cannabis and hang out with a whole bunch of their friends and meet Adam ill this table the secret sesh in Denver, Colorado
[02:11:10.840 --> 02:11:15.320]  I'm for 20 hosted by Gatsby Gardens. I was supposed to shut that out at the start of the show
[02:11:15.800 --> 02:11:17.800]  You'll be there. I'll be there
[02:11:18.040 --> 02:11:24.620]  Working Michael be working someone's got to do it bro. Yeah, shout-out to the Grammy Gatsby. Thanks for all the love, bro
[02:11:24.620 --> 02:11:26.620]  I appreciate it
[02:11:26.980 --> 02:11:28.980]  We
[02:11:29.420 --> 02:11:31.420]  Actually just confirmed our DJ
[02:11:31.420 --> 02:11:34.900]  I've been talking about the DJ that we might get we just confirmed it so I have to get permission
[02:11:35.540 --> 02:11:39.580]  From the people that are hosting the event before I can announce the DJ on the show and confirm
[02:11:39.580 --> 02:11:44.620]  We've got it. We've got a good DJ. I asked one of my favorite rappers to come rap and
[02:11:45.340 --> 02:11:47.340]  crickets
[02:11:48.980 --> 02:11:51.940]  Yoda dabbed again. Oh god. We're not gonna go there
[02:11:52.700 --> 02:11:54.700]  It's a highly educated titanium
[02:11:55.380 --> 02:11:57.380]  Young lady you want the show back I kind of took over
[02:12:01.060 --> 02:12:06.960]  I really think we're right at one hour. I'm in that fine spot between to dab did not dab
[02:12:07.300 --> 02:12:11.100]  That's usually I'm either too high for this shit or not high enough for this shit
[02:12:11.100 --> 02:12:16.260]  So honestly the last three questions are what we had talked about that. They're all shows in themselves
[02:12:16.700 --> 02:12:21.700]  So I don't I mean we can do a round two of this what I think we should do is
[02:12:21.900 --> 02:12:27.340]  Let the listeners listen to this one and if you guys have any questions or things that you'd like to follow up on in this

[02:13:46.700 --> 02:13:51.180]  You can tell he knows a lot of buzzwords and knows his shit when it comes to cannabis legislation nationwide
[02:13:51.820 --> 02:13:55.940]  He really focuses on the state and the local but he knows his shit all statewide
[02:13:55.940 --> 02:13:58.880]  I'm kind of like a heroin junkie in that fashion
[02:13:58.880 --> 02:14:00.360]  Like when I wake up in the morning
[02:14:00.360 --> 02:14:06.060]  One of the first things I do is hop online and check a couple of different really good news sources
[02:14:06.660 --> 02:14:09.860]  For what's going on in marijuana today?
[02:14:10.660 --> 02:14:14.060]  And I have to like it's a fucking compulsion after all these years
[02:14:14.260 --> 02:14:18.100]  When I don't get to do it in the morning all day at work, I'm like I get to read the fucking paper
[02:14:20.180 --> 02:14:23.140]  And it's digital now, so I'm not just getting the Denver Post
[02:14:23.140 --> 02:14:28.440]  I read like 17 or 18 different newspapers if you want to classify the amount of news as a paper
[02:14:29.020 --> 02:14:34.900]  A day just following this stuff is a compulsion now. So yeah, I do all the good stuff
[02:14:34.900 --> 02:14:36.900]  I share to that Facebook page or
[02:14:37.220 --> 02:14:38.980]  Some of the stuff gets up on Twitter
[02:14:38.980 --> 02:14:44.820]  Make sure you follow that Facebook page guys and also check them out on Twitter if you follow Mike on Twitter from this podcast
[02:14:45.860 --> 02:14:50.540]  Tag Mike tag the podcast and tell him I heard about you through the GFYH
[02:14:50.740 --> 02:14:54.420]  Podcast and let him know because he likes to know where his listeners and followers are coming, right?
[02:14:54.420 --> 02:15:00.220]  most of my followers follow me because I regularly smack anti-marijuana people on Twitter and
[02:15:00.580 --> 02:15:03.280]  That gets you a bunch of really weird follows
[02:15:04.340 --> 02:15:07.060]  And then every day every now and again at 2 in the morning
[02:15:07.060 --> 02:15:11.580]  I'll get a bunch of random follows when I haven't been on Twitter in six days and I have to think it's a podcast thing
[02:15:11.580 --> 02:15:16.460]  But I never fucking know so answer that question for me, please. Yeah, just be like hey Mike. Hey at Nemo Punk
[02:15:16.460 --> 02:15:23.220]  What's the number 15? Yeah at Nemo Punk 15 at Nemo Punk 15. We found you on the and then at GFYH podcast
[02:15:23.220 --> 02:15:26.820]  Yeah, we found it from the pot. If you don't want to do it in a tweet, you can do it in a message
[02:15:27.140 --> 02:15:32.900]  Yeah, whatever you let the guy know. All right, dude. Thanks for coming. Happy to me. The wife and kid
[02:15:33.420 --> 02:15:38.900]  Babies yeah. All right, miss traveling stoner. Yes. How can people follow you on the social media? So
[02:15:40.380 --> 02:15:43.660]  Instagram and periscope are the same. It's the traveling stoner
[02:15:44.380 --> 02:15:50.700]  My Twitter is traveling stoner and then my snapchat is traveling stoner without the G
[02:15:50.940 --> 02:15:55.260]  so someone went and snatched up all of the traveling stoner on a certain amount of
[02:15:56.100 --> 02:15:59.140]  Social media sites that I didn't yeah, so anyways
[02:15:59.860 --> 02:16:04.900]  So yeah, so it's all over the place but those are them and blog intern for miss Mary Jane Coe
[02:16:04.900 --> 02:16:06.900]  Yes, miss Mary Jane Coe

[02:16:35.180 --> 02:16:40.200]  Her and I saw that on Instagram it was hilarious her above a blaster co-run a hike and they post a picture and she tags
[02:16:40.200 --> 02:16:42.200]  it ganja girls

[02:16:50.220 --> 02:16:54.700]  He is appealing. So one of my girlfriends called it out and she was like, oh my god
[02:16:54.740 --> 02:17:00.340]  What cute ganja girls and then she immediately wrote like oh my god. I'm so sorry. Like I sometimes I get really high
[02:17:00.340 --> 02:17:02.340]  I think I'm funny on the internet. I'm really sorry
[02:17:08.060 --> 02:17:13.900]  Apologize for that what's up? You're my favorite ganja girl. You could easily be a 420 nurse
[02:17:19.460 --> 02:17:23.540]  I've only seen one photo and I took that photo and I just threw the fucking
[02:17:24.900 --> 02:17:30.100]  Blaster co is and now you're imagining imagining him as all that fur and those little green crosses

[02:18:18.020 --> 02:18:22.480]  I want to thank everybody for listening to the show you guys, you know, I will be back in another week with another episode
[02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:25.720]  Our friend Kabuki J Fox was messaging me
[02:18:25.720 --> 02:18:29.000]  He was gonna try to get over here for the podcast, but he had a lot going on. We took forever
[02:18:29.880 --> 02:18:34.640]  Kabuki will be in Pueblo much more frequently. He just got involved in a project here in Pueblo
[02:18:34.640 --> 02:18:41.200]  so we're gonna have run CBD here in the way pumped about that kitchen slash studio slash dining room
[02:18:41.200 --> 02:18:46.000]  We'll get Kabuki over here. We'll take some CBD dabs and talk about turps for tots and stuff like that
[02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:52.880]  It's the best bucket hashtag I just I spattered it out one day at the the event for the veteran farmers Alliance
[02:18:52.880 --> 02:18:55.200]  All right, guys, the podcast is officially over
[02:18:55.200 --> 02:18:59.360]  I would like it if you go to iTunes go to the iTunes store search for the grow from your heart podcast find the review

[02:19:02.400 --> 02:19:07.520]  What happens when you do that that moves us up in the rankings God, I stuttered when I said rankings. That was weird
[02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:08.760]  Why is it such a hard work?
[02:19:08.760 --> 02:19:13.960]  I move this up in the rankings more people will see us the more people that see the podcast means more people will listen
[02:19:14.040 --> 02:19:20.360]  Which means more people will be growing much better quality cannabis will make better cannabis available for the world
[02:19:20.360 --> 02:19:23.520]  We will overgrow the government one click at a time
[02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:27.120]  I think I just made up a new slogan on accident, but you guys seriously
[02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:30.080]  Give me a five-star rating type in a little comment. Let me know what you think of the show

[02:19:55.280 --> 02:19:57.760]  The website may only hold a hundred episodes of what I'm learning
[02:19:58.040 --> 02:20:02.880]  So I will go back and when it when it takes down the important shit, I'll put it back up. Anyway, um

[02:26:46.110 --> 02:26:50.030]  But I want to start off by reading some of the comments that I have got here on iTunes
[02:26:50.030 --> 02:26:53.390]  I'm actually pulling up those comments right now. It's gonna take a second
[02:26:53.990 --> 02:26:57.510]  Alright, I'm pulling up the comments. I'm getting there if you want to leave a comment on the podcast
[02:26:57.510 --> 02:27:02.230]  All you got to do is go to iTunes go to the iTunes Store type in grow from your heart

[02:27:04.990 --> 02:27:10.710]  Click on podcast click on the icon that shows my face and the title and then there will be an area where it says details
[02:27:10.710 --> 02:27:12.710]  ratings and reviews and related
[02:27:12.990 --> 02:27:18.030]  All you got to do is click on ratings and reviews. That's where I just clicked and I can see all of your reviews
[02:27:18.190 --> 02:27:22.830]  So let's go ahead and read. We've got three new comments. Let's go read three all three of these new reviews
[02:27:22.830 --> 02:27:25.630]  I'm gonna kick down this music and the first comment says
[02:27:27.070 --> 02:27:31.550]  No, I didn't scroll down far enough. That's why that seemed weird. All right, the first comment says it's from our friend
[02:27:32.070 --> 02:27:33.190]  J
[02:27:33.190 --> 02:27:37.950]  Just like JJ's like Veda. I know I said that wrong, but I really tried to say it right anyway
[02:27:38.430 --> 02:27:42.670]  The comment goes like this. Oh, we got a five-star rating. Also the comment goes like this. Thanks, man
[02:27:43.030 --> 02:27:45.310]  For great teaching and your great attitude
[02:27:45.310 --> 02:27:47.870]  I've learned a ton and I hope you continue your great work
[02:27:48.070 --> 02:27:50.310]  Episode 113 is amazing by the way
[02:27:50.310 --> 02:27:55.810]  And I'm sure it will help me more than I can now foresee once I have those checklists set up for use
[02:27:55.910 --> 02:27:57.910]  Peace out old man, John
[02:27:58.710 --> 02:28:03.990]  Hey, John, I'm glad episode 113 helped you out. I'm glad that grow room checklist is gonna come in handy for you
[02:28:04.310 --> 02:28:10.610]  I've done episodes about planning your grow room and I've done episodes about building your grow room and I've done an episode about planning a
[02:28:10.790 --> 02:28:15.710]  Perpetual grow or a perpetual harvest. So I think if you go back and listen to those episodes
[02:28:15.710 --> 02:28:21.830]  They were really compound with episode 113 and you will have a great start to growing your own cannabis when the time comes
[02:28:22.030 --> 02:28:25.910]  So big shout out to J. Just like Veda or old man
[02:28:25.910 --> 02:28:31.430]  John as he signed the email or the message shout out. Thanks for the five-star review and thanks for the review
[02:28:31.590 --> 02:28:38.290]  So the next one comes from my buddy Rasta Ralph 719, what's up dreadlock brother? Thanks for leaving a comment on iTunes

[02:29:53.630 --> 02:29:57.330]  All right, you guys that is all of the new iTunes comments
[02:29:57.330 --> 02:30:01.810]  I like to thank everybody that left a comment the old comments and the new comments. I definitely appreciate it
[02:30:01.810 --> 02:30:05.210]  We've got quite a few comments up here. We've got 31 5 star reviews
[02:30:05.250 --> 02:30:08.710]  We do not have any reviews that did not get 5 stars
[02:30:08.750 --> 02:30:13.350]  So it'd be cool if you go to iTunes throw up a 5 star rating. Give me a little comment
[02:30:13.350 --> 02:30:16.510]  Let me know what you think about this show and I will read your comment on a future episode
[02:30:16.590 --> 02:30:22.630]  What that will do is help me move up in the iTunes ranking and more people will see the show or people will start listening
[02:30:23.030 --> 02:30:29.010]  Or people will grow better cannabis more people will support the legalization movement. It will just help out cannabis
[02:30:29.530 --> 02:30:33.490]  Altogether, so please do that. I would appreciate it. Thanks again. Everybody that sent a comment
[02:30:34.110 --> 02:30:35.070]  All right
[02:30:35.070 --> 02:30:40.390]  I've got a bunch of emails now that I would like to quickly read so that we can move on into some grow lessons
[02:30:41.070 --> 02:30:44.410]  Let me get these comments up on there these emails up on the screen
[02:30:45.750 --> 02:30:50.630]  Sometimes I'm not sure if you guys want me to say your actual names or email addresses or whatever
[02:30:50.630 --> 02:30:52.790]  So I'm going to try to remember to not do that
[02:30:52.790 --> 02:30:57.970]  Sometimes I take too many dads and I blurred out people's names and shit, but we're gonna do our best to not do that
[02:30:58.750 --> 02:31:02.990]  This first email was sent to me with the subject to love the podcast and it goes like this
[02:31:02.990 --> 02:31:08.950]  I was looking for a cool podcast that nerds out on growing and the GW YH podcast. That's the GF
[02:31:08.950 --> 02:31:13.870]  Why a cheer close a girl with your heart is what I think you meant GF YH podcast is perfect
[02:31:13.870 --> 02:31:16.310]  I listened to a bunch of podcast and yours is the best
[02:31:16.470 --> 02:31:18.850]  I've been an underground grower for the last decade
[02:31:18.850 --> 02:31:25.270]  But just got my med license up here in the northwest about two years ago and this whole legal cannabis world blows my mind
[02:31:25.550 --> 02:31:29.550]  I've gone to some growers conferences, but I don't know if I'll ever be able to adapt to it
[02:31:29.550 --> 02:31:32.590]  I really appreciate the 411 from Jeff. It's amazing
[02:31:32.590 --> 02:31:39.830]  I'm completely self-taught hydro grower who learned from trial and error, but the master class and the way Jeff lays out info is magnificent
[02:31:39.830 --> 02:31:42.970]  I've learned so much just from the few episodes. I've had time to catch
[02:31:42.970 --> 02:31:48.570]  I really hope you guys keep it up as it's a tremendous service to the other growers out there
[02:31:49.570 --> 02:31:54.530]  That kind of email is what makes all of my effort to do this show worth my time and energy you guys
[02:31:55.130 --> 02:31:57.610]  It feels good to hear people say that I'm laying out the information
[02:31:57.770 --> 02:32:03.610]  in a way that you can understand it because that was my mission a lot of what prompted me to do this podcast was
[02:32:03.810 --> 02:32:10.730]  Reading things on the internet in forums where people were trusting grow advice and people were giving terrible shitty false advice
[02:32:11.130 --> 02:32:17.310]  That we're gonna cause more problems or they were giving advice that were simply based on product use like oh
[02:32:17.310 --> 02:32:19.310]  You've got spider mites buy this product
[02:32:19.310 --> 02:32:22.610]  But then all you're gonna be doing is buying that product for the rest of your grow career
[02:32:22.610 --> 02:32:26.050]  You're never going to eliminate the mites. You're just gonna be chasing them down with the product
[02:32:26.050 --> 02:32:30.850]  I thought it'd be wiser to come on here and teach you how to get rid of those damn mites how to fix your room
[02:32:31.370 --> 02:32:34.870]  Understand where the mites are coming from. So I do appreciate that you
[02:32:35.390 --> 02:32:37.490]  Understand and appreciate the way I'm laying things out
[02:32:37.730 --> 02:32:44.090]  One thing you said was that my podcast is the best I appreciate that but I I'm not in competition with anybody
[02:32:44.090 --> 02:32:45.610]  I know the other shows out there
[02:32:45.610 --> 02:32:49.450]  Sometimes I listen to some of them because I like to hear what's going on and I like to gain the other info
[02:32:49.450 --> 02:32:51.530]  But I'm really not in any competition with anybody else
[02:32:51.530 --> 02:32:56.830]  But I do appreciate hearing that you think I'm the best if there were a podcast award or something and you chose to give it
[02:32:56.830 --> 02:33:02.690]  To me, I definitely would not decline that shit. So thanks for that huge compliment and thank you for the email
[02:33:02.890 --> 02:33:06.730]  All right, I'm gonna pull up another email. This one says good morning Rasta Jeff
[02:33:06.730 --> 02:33:09.890]  I just sent a big thanks your way on Twitter. Thank you for the podcast
[02:33:09.890 --> 02:33:13.910]  I'm taking notes to set up my first professional room. You talked to me into organics
[02:33:13.910 --> 02:33:17.810]  I have a specific question for you and an 11 by 11 room
[02:33:17.810 --> 02:33:21.450]  How much area should I have for veg room and a flower room?
[02:33:21.450 --> 02:33:26.730]  I was thinking 6 by 11 flower and a 4 by 5 veg room and then he shows a little picture here
[02:33:26.730 --> 02:33:31.810]  How he divided the room. Um, I like what you've done. He's got an 11 by 11 flower
[02:33:31.810 --> 02:33:37.250]  He's got himself a 4 by 5 veg and a 7 by 5 work area. The only thing I don't really
[02:33:37.890 --> 02:33:41.130]  I'm not super stoked about is that 7 by 5 work area?
[02:33:41.130 --> 02:33:43.130]  I know that's not a lot of space to do work
[02:33:43.210 --> 02:33:49.330]  But what actually are you going to be doing in there that you need to take room from your grow space to dedicate to the
[02:33:49.330 --> 02:33:54.730]  Work, I would almost I would add another foot onto that veg area
[02:33:54.730 --> 02:33:58.170]  I do a 5 by 5 veg area and keep that 6 by 11 flower
[02:33:58.170 --> 02:34:02.570]  Just like it is the 6 by 11 flower is nice and tight. You're not gonna lose too much light
[02:34:02.570 --> 02:34:06.490]  I would recommend hanging to 1000 watt lights in your 6 by 11 and maybe
[02:34:06.770 --> 02:34:10.130]  1000 watt in your 5 by 5 veg is what I would recommend
[02:34:10.650 --> 02:34:15.010]  I'm not sure that that's what you're gonna do. But if you listen to my perpetual grow episode
[02:34:15.610 --> 02:34:20.410]  The one 5 by 5 and the two lights in the 6 by 11 will really crush it
[02:34:20.410 --> 02:34:23.130]  You'll be able to do huge shit in there. I think it'd work out for you
[02:34:24.130 --> 02:34:28.450]  I'm not sure why you want a 7 by 5 work area. You're not gonna use that much space
[02:34:28.690 --> 02:34:30.890]  Mostly what you're gonna be doing is mixing nutrients
[02:34:31.330 --> 02:34:34.250]  You may have I don't know if you plan on working in the plants in there
[02:34:34.250 --> 02:34:37.770]  But you can work on the plants in the flower room if you need to top them lollipop them
[02:34:37.970 --> 02:34:40.090]  Maybe you'll be transplanting or something in there
[02:34:40.090 --> 02:34:43.050]  But I really wouldn't I don't want to call it a waste
[02:34:43.050 --> 02:34:48.610]  But it is almost a waste of space to use it as a work area as opposed to part of the grow space
[02:34:48.810 --> 02:34:51.610]  You can work in grow space if that if it comes down to that
[02:34:53.130 --> 02:34:58.450]  If you really wanted to you could eliminate that workspace and almost add a whole nother light with that space
[02:34:58.450 --> 02:35:01.090]  We could totally do that. All right, that's my opinion
[02:35:02.170 --> 02:35:06.690]  If I just read your email and I answered that and confused you more or helped you out
[02:35:06.690 --> 02:35:11.070]  Send me more details and we will narrow this down and get this room right for you. We'll get it. Perfect. It'll be sexy
[02:35:11.770 --> 02:35:15.370]  Anyway, good job planning a room. Not a lot of people actually go and write that shit down
[02:35:15.370 --> 02:35:20.410]  So props for that and also thanks for sending me an email. I look forward to your reply
[02:35:20.770 --> 02:35:27.610]  Let's see, let's get into our next email this one was headlined tinctures and it says Jeff. Hey, man, Floridian here
[02:35:27.730 --> 02:35:32.290]  I've been listening to your show. His name is not Floridian. By the way, he's from Florida is what I think that meant
[02:35:32.850 --> 02:35:38.290]  He says I've been listening to your show just so I can keep tabs on the industry and culture in Colorado. It is interesting
[02:35:38.290 --> 02:35:41.010]  I'm not a smoker, but I respect and support the rights of those who are
[02:35:41.650 --> 02:35:43.610]  Respect there's more to this email
[02:35:43.610 --> 02:35:46.450]  But I want to jump in and say that's rad because at the start of the show
[02:35:46.450 --> 02:35:50.890]  I say if you're just curious about the current state of cannabis. This is the show for you
[02:35:50.890 --> 02:35:54.810]  Well, this guy right here is the guy who is only curious about the current state of cannabis
[02:35:54.810 --> 02:36:00.210]  So we're aiming the show right at him and it hit him and he's listening. That's awesome. Perfect bond right there. I appreciate that
[02:36:00.650 --> 02:36:05.730]  He goes on to say anyway, I know someone who is having trouble sleeping and I heard THC tinctures work
[02:36:05.730 --> 02:36:11.770]  Well for that and fast. Can you direct me to some information about tincture varieties dosage and potency?
[02:36:12.050 --> 02:36:15.810]  Also, do you know roughly how much an average bottle costs in the Colorado marketplace?
[02:36:15.970 --> 02:36:18.130]  If you had a show that covers the topic
[02:36:18.130 --> 02:36:22.010]  I'd love to know which one or perhaps you can talk a little about this in a future episode
[02:36:22.130 --> 02:36:26.850]  Take care of yourself and then he says word and signed his not real name
[02:36:26.850 --> 02:36:29.690]  I think we could say your name since you called yourself J dog, right?
[02:36:30.250 --> 02:36:32.250]  So shout out the J dog for sending me an email
[02:36:32.610 --> 02:36:37.170]  I want to get my friend Fox to come on the show and talk a little bit about tinctures
[02:36:37.930 --> 02:36:42.610]  Fox you were invited on the podcast Fox just moved near me. So you got to come be on the show, dude
[02:36:42.610 --> 02:36:46.770]  Let's talk about tinctures and help this guy and his friends out what I can tell you about tincture
[02:36:46.770 --> 02:36:51.450]  You asked a couple of things here. Can I direct you to some info such as dosage and potency?
[02:36:52.530 --> 02:36:58.370]  Dosage is based on potency and when you come to Colorado, you can buy a bottle of tincture that will have the exact
[02:36:59.010 --> 02:37:01.850]  Potency per dose printed on the bottle it will say if you take
[02:37:02.370 --> 02:37:06.850]  It'll probably be like an ounce or a two ounce bottle. It'll say if you drink this whole ounce
[02:37:06.850 --> 02:37:11.890]  You'll probably consume 250 milligrams of THC if you are a new consumer
[02:37:11.890 --> 02:37:15.630]  I think we recommend 25 milligrams as the starting dose
[02:37:16.050 --> 02:37:22.230]  You want 25 milligrams of cannabinoids of THC in your body to start with eat that wait
[02:37:22.230 --> 02:37:26.430]  If it's tincture, you just basically drink it put it in a medicine dropper to put it into some coffee
[02:37:26.430 --> 02:37:30.450]  You put it into some juice. I just pour it right down the throat. I just drink it. It tastes pretty good
[02:37:30.450 --> 02:37:32.450]  It's got like a warm honey kind of flavor
[02:37:32.930 --> 02:37:34.930]  Take 25 milligrams
[02:37:35.410 --> 02:37:39.410]  Take enough tincture that will contain 25 milligrams and wait about 45 minutes
[02:37:39.410 --> 02:37:43.530]  See if you see any effect if you don't take another 25 milligram dose
[02:37:43.810 --> 02:37:45.730]  You can always take more tincture
[02:37:45.730 --> 02:37:51.210]  But you can't undo how much tincture you've taken and a tincture high comes on quickly and when it is
[02:37:51.850 --> 02:37:57.330]  Appropriately dosed it can be strong. It will hit you and you will feel it. So dosage is based on potency
[02:37:57.330 --> 02:38:02.250]  I would say take 25 milligrams at a time and work your way up
[02:38:03.370 --> 02:38:08.690]  It's gonna be unless you come to Colorado or a medical state. It'll be hard to judge the potency of your tincture, honestly
[02:38:08.970 --> 02:38:10.330]  so
[02:38:10.330 --> 02:38:11.770]  That's dosage
[02:38:11.770 --> 02:38:17.010]  We were talking you asked about sativas and indica's indica's would definitely be better for the sleep in my opinion
[02:38:17.010 --> 02:38:19.850]  If you're trying to put your body to relax mode, you want some indica?
[02:38:19.850 --> 02:38:23.210]  You may want some CBD in there CBD may help your body relax
[02:38:23.970 --> 02:38:26.530]  It'll just make you chill out a little bit that may help you sleep
[02:38:26.770 --> 02:38:30.290]  So I would recommend a heavy indica or something with some CBD in it
[02:38:30.650 --> 02:38:36.650]  That'll definitely help with the sleep and then you say also do you know roughly how much an average bottle costs in Colorado?
[02:38:36.970 --> 02:38:41.890]  The price is going to vary from shop to shop and it will certainly vary between medical and recreational
[02:38:42.370 --> 02:38:44.370]  Facilities in a medical facility
[02:38:44.370 --> 02:38:51.930]  I think the average price of an edible which includes tinctures is going to be around ten to fifteen dollars per hundred
[02:38:52.010 --> 02:38:58.090]  Milligrams of cannabinoids. So if there's a hundred milligrams of THC in there, it's probably gonna cost you ten to fifteen dollars
[02:38:58.090 --> 02:39:01.210]  If there's 200 expect to spend 20 to 25
[02:39:01.770 --> 02:39:06.050]  If you're getting up in the 300 milligrams look to spend 30 to 45 bucks
[02:39:06.290 --> 02:39:10.490]  That's kind of the scale that I have seen it working on that is not hard and fast at all
[02:39:10.530 --> 02:39:15.330]  Trust me that is not solid anywhere, but that's what I've seen. It's about 10 bucks for 100 milligrams
[02:39:15.570 --> 02:39:21.050]  If you go to a recreational marketplace, it'll probably be one and a half times that much
[02:39:21.090 --> 02:39:25.570]  So you're looking at 15 to 20 bucks for your hundred milligrams. You're looking at like
[02:39:26.410 --> 02:39:31.010]  somewhere between 30 to 50 bucks for a 200 milligram edible and some of the recreational facilities
[02:39:31.210 --> 02:39:36.290]  But they do have a huge markup because they know people are coming from all over the country all over the world and they will
[02:39:36.290 --> 02:39:41.330]  Pay the price just to have the experience and have the access. So that's how much you should expect to pay
[02:39:41.330 --> 02:39:45.650]  I will get our friend Kabuki J Fox on here. What up Kabuki? I need you on the show, bro
[02:39:45.650 --> 02:39:50.410]  Let's do an episode a little bit more about tinctures. I think the tinctures will hit you quickly
[02:39:50.410 --> 02:39:52.890]  I think that will work to help your friend get some sleep
[02:39:53.290 --> 02:39:56.690]  You got to come to Colorado and get it. One thing I can recommend is
[02:39:57.650 --> 02:40:02.050]  Full CBD CBD is legal nationwide if you can find CBD
[02:40:02.290 --> 02:40:06.590]  That was derived from cannabis or hemp and is all organic natural CBD
[02:40:06.690 --> 02:40:12.410]  You can consume possess you can have CBD products if as long as they don't have THC in them
[02:40:12.410 --> 02:40:17.830]  You can have CBD products in Florida. There are companies that will send a CBD to you in Florida
[02:40:18.170 --> 02:40:23.330]  Try that be careful. Don't get anything from China. Make sure it's made in America. Try to find a reputable source
[02:40:24.130 --> 02:40:28.930]  Try that out. Maybe that will work for you. That's my advice. I want to say thanks for that email
[02:40:28.930 --> 02:40:31.770]  Thanks for supporting the show J dog. I hope I gave you some good info
[02:40:31.770 --> 02:40:35.450]  If you have more questions, please feel free to email them to me
[02:40:35.450 --> 02:40:40.690]  I would love to help your friend get some good rest and also thanks for trying to get some info for your friend
[02:40:40.690 --> 02:40:45.690]  That's a good friend big shout out fist bump much respect. All right, our next email comes from odds, right?
[02:40:45.690 --> 02:40:47.690]  I'm not gonna say this guy's name. Our next email is
[02:40:48.130 --> 02:40:52.010]  Headlined or subject did aquaponic grower and he says hi there
[02:40:52.010 --> 02:40:55.890]  I recently found your podcast after someone recommended it to me and I really enjoy the show
[02:40:55.890 --> 02:41:02.490]  I've been working on perfecting cannabis growing and aquaponics for the past few years and was curious if you have ever had anyone on the
[02:41:02.490 --> 02:41:08.890]  Show to talk about the aquaponic growing if you are ever looking for someone to talk about the differences about growing in aquaponics
[02:41:08.890 --> 02:41:13.810]  I would love to thanks for taking the time to read my email and I look forward to hearing back from you
[02:41:14.290 --> 02:41:15.930]  All right. Well, let me get right to it
[02:41:15.930 --> 02:41:21.410]  I am NOT very experienced in aquaponic growing, but I would love to hear what you've got to say
[02:41:22.050 --> 02:41:25.570]  If you want to be on the show, we can set up maybe a FaceTime interview
[02:41:25.570 --> 02:41:28.990]  Maybe we could do it through Skype or something FaceTime would be the easiest for me
[02:41:28.990 --> 02:41:34.930]  So if you're listening to this episode and you sent me the email about aquaponic growing, please contact me send me another email
[02:41:34.930 --> 02:41:36.850]  We will set up a way to get you on this podcast
[02:41:36.850 --> 02:41:41.170]  If you've got an iPhone or a MacBook, we're golden. All we've got to do is make a quick phone call
[02:41:41.330 --> 02:41:47.010]  We can record I'd love to get you on the show. I'm sure a lot of people would love to know about aquaponic growing
[02:41:47.010 --> 02:41:49.350]  I'm sorry. I don't have any more information for you on it
[02:41:49.710 --> 02:41:53.330]  But by the looks of it you've got it all figured out so I'd love to get you on the show
[02:41:53.550 --> 02:41:59.690]  One thing I want to mention is this guy's email said that he learned about the show after someone recommended it to him
[02:41:59.710 --> 02:42:05.110]  You guys what I would like for you to do is recommend my podcast to three of your friends
[02:42:05.110 --> 02:42:09.310]  That's right three of them because only one of them is gonna actually end up becoming a subscriber and a longtime listener
[02:42:09.310 --> 02:42:11.270]  But tell three people
[02:42:11.270 --> 02:42:13.790]  Maybe you'll tell somebody that smokes cannabis every day
[02:42:13.790 --> 02:42:19.330]  Maybe you'll tell somebody that grows cannabis every day or maybe you'll tell people that are afraid of cannabis and need to learn the truth
[02:42:19.330 --> 02:42:24.090]  About cannabis and realize it there's a guy out here that smokes more hash than most people could even imagine
[02:42:24.250 --> 02:42:29.850]  Every single day and I'm able to put together a podcast. I've got a solid career. I own multiple companies
[02:42:29.850 --> 02:42:31.170]  I've got my shit together
[02:42:31.170 --> 02:42:38.130]  Maybe this podcast can free up some myths and get people out of the the dark ages when it comes to cannabis mindset
[02:42:38.210 --> 02:42:41.370]  All right, so introduce three people to my show. That's what I'm trying to say
[02:42:41.370 --> 02:42:46.970]  And I want to thank my friend with his aquaponic email. That's a great email. I hope we can get you on the show
[02:42:47.290 --> 02:42:51.110]  All right, I've got another email this one is kind of long but it goes like this
[02:42:51.110 --> 02:42:54.210]  Thank you very much for taking the time out once again and answering my emails
[02:42:54.210 --> 02:42:59.170]  Oh, this is from a guy that I replied to before and his name we've said his name on the show before this is from
[02:42:59.170 --> 02:43:04.930]  The Tri-County Bandit. He says thank you for very much for taking time out once again and answering my emails real talk
[02:43:04.930 --> 02:43:09.130]  You're a real person dude, and I appreciate you. Thank you for taking up most of the show for me
[02:43:09.130 --> 02:43:11.850]  Well, I guess it's partly my fault for the long-winded email
[02:43:11.850 --> 02:43:18.050]  Let me try and be brief as you were explaining to me on the podcast about phenotypical expressions and my environment it dawned on me
[02:43:18.050 --> 02:43:23.810]  I've been growing out different strains now and they all seem to be very hairy. I've been wondering what the fuck has been going on
[02:43:23.810 --> 02:43:26.570]  I know pistols are good, but it seems I get a whole lot
[02:43:26.610 --> 02:43:32.130]  I'd like to see my trikes which are there but seems like I have to trim hairs back to see the actual blood mass
[02:43:32.290 --> 02:43:37.330]  Could this be a sign of bad environment or lacking something there in shits dank though Jeff
[02:43:38.050 --> 02:43:42.010]  But the bottom of my jars are just loaded with hairs can my trimming be really shitty
[02:43:42.250 --> 02:43:47.370]  Do you get this problem or have you ever known anyone who has and I think maybe it has to deal with the humidity
[02:43:47.370 --> 02:43:51.730]  Maybe as Florida gets 95% most of the year, but I could be wrong
[02:43:51.930 --> 02:43:56.490]  I'd love to hear that future podcast on selecting a male for breeding. We just did that one broats out
[02:43:56.490 --> 02:43:59.210]  So I hope you heard that I start my garden from regular seeds
[02:43:59.210 --> 02:44:06.370]  So naturally some of my some males sprout and would love to try to I would love to recreate more seeds for myself
[02:44:06.610 --> 02:44:10.090]  Also, thanks again for giving a shit man. I appreciate your input on my eating
[02:44:10.090 --> 02:44:11.610]  I'm not vegan or shit, man
[02:44:11.610 --> 02:44:12.570]  But I'm not even a vegetarian
[02:44:12.570 --> 02:44:17.370]  But I'm trying to change my habits and I've noticed that on the weeks where I have salads and water
[02:44:17.370 --> 02:44:21.430]  I feel the best would love to hear about some good recipes if you got some bro
[02:44:21.430 --> 02:44:25.650]  And hey, I hear it if you're not the Suzy homemaker types, you're not trying to give me recipes
[02:44:25.650 --> 02:44:32.070]  But let me know what's on Ross and Jeff's weekly menu. Never really met any vegans. I only heard about them on the radio and TV
[02:44:32.070 --> 02:44:37.590]  I can't imagine what you would do without meat or eggs. You don't eat eggs either, right?
[02:44:37.590 --> 02:44:42.070]  Damn, my bad Jeff got really baked and listen to the show like twice stoned again and wrote this email
[02:44:42.070 --> 02:44:45.750]  Sorry for the ramble so much for keeping it brief. This does not have to be on the show
[02:44:45.750 --> 02:44:51.070]  It can be if you'd like much love Tri County bandit. Guess what bro your whole damn email made it to the show
[02:44:51.430 --> 02:44:55.830]  Let me back up and I will answer some of your questions
[02:44:56.510 --> 02:44:59.750]  Yes, your buds are airy because it's too hot probably
[02:44:59.750 --> 02:45:03.730]  I think your buds are getting airy and fluffy because it's too hot and too humid in your grow space
[02:45:04.110 --> 02:45:06.110]  You need to give it some more cool air
[02:45:06.630 --> 02:45:09.110]  possibly back the lights up from the plants a little bit and
[02:45:10.550 --> 02:45:12.910]  Lower the humidity. I'm not sure if you're growing indoors or outdoors
[02:45:13.270 --> 02:45:17.750]  But you need lower humidity and probably some more fans cool those plants off
[02:45:17.990 --> 02:45:21.270]  So think about in the summer when it gets real hot
[02:45:21.750 --> 02:45:26.070]  Your plants are puffing out because they're trying to get off of each other so that they aren't like you don't
[02:45:26.230 --> 02:45:30.830]  Alright, this is the only way I can describe it dude in the summertime your balls hang real low because it's hot your balls
[02:45:30.830 --> 02:45:33.470]  Don't want to be up by your body because it's all hot and sweaty there
[02:45:33.470 --> 02:45:35.390]  So they try to creep away from your body a little bit
[02:45:35.390 --> 02:45:39.290]  Your plants are doing the same thing the calyxes are trying to get away from each other because it's too hot
[02:45:39.290 --> 02:45:44.950]  They're getting sweaty on each other. So give them some cool space cool it down and then they'll get nice and tight
[02:45:44.950 --> 02:45:47.690]  They'll get a little smaller. You notice what happens to your nutsack when it's all cold
[02:45:47.690 --> 02:45:51.070]  It just goes boom. You get a little coin purse same things happen into your plants, bro
[02:45:51.070 --> 02:45:54.550]  I cannot believe I just said that on the podcast, but it's the only way I've got to describe this
[02:45:55.070 --> 02:45:57.070]  All right, so the next part you talk about
[02:45:57.790 --> 02:46:03.110]  Eating naturally. I'm not a vegan. Let me clear that one up. I am NOT vegan one day per week
[02:46:03.110 --> 02:46:05.670]  I do eat a vegan diet one day per week
[02:46:05.670 --> 02:46:08.770]  I do not include any animals in my eating one day out of the week
[02:46:08.870 --> 02:46:13.230]  That day out of the week could be any random day. I don't do it every Thursday. I don't do it every Tuesday
[02:46:13.230 --> 02:46:19.950]  I just make a concert conscious effort to one day weekly not eat any animal products. I am always a vegetarian
[02:46:19.950 --> 02:46:24.390]  I do not consume any flesh of any animal. I don't eat fish. I don't eat chicken. I don't eat meat
[02:46:24.630 --> 02:46:26.910]  Of any kind at all. I don't eat bacon
[02:46:26.910 --> 02:46:31.430]  I won't eat your pizza if it had a pepperoni on it and you peeled the pepperoni off. I still don't want that shit
[02:46:31.910 --> 02:46:34.530]  That's how I roll not a vegan just a strict vegetarian
[02:46:35.350 --> 02:46:36.470]  so
[02:46:36.470 --> 02:46:41.830]  You asked about some recipes and stuff. Honestly, bro. I am a terrible vegetarian. I eat a shit ton of pizza
[02:46:41.830 --> 02:46:46.590]  I eat a bunch of pasta and I eat a bunch of salads. I'm a bachelor
[02:46:46.590 --> 02:46:51.410]  I eat on the go most of the time. So a lot of my diet consists of Thai food
[02:46:51.410 --> 02:46:58.130]  I love a lot of pad Thai. I love a lot of rice meals. I eat a lot of eggplant. I eat a lot of bananas
[02:46:59.010 --> 02:47:04.850]  Almost every meal I eat has an avocado involved in some way shape or form. I drink a lot of kombucha teas
[02:47:04.850 --> 02:47:07.130]  I like probiotics. I drink a lot of coconut water
[02:47:07.810 --> 02:47:11.150]  That's kind of stuff that I eat lots of fruits and vegetables
[02:47:11.490 --> 02:47:16.250]  I've been trying to replace all of my snacks if I want a sugary snack or a granola bar or some shit like that
[02:47:16.370 --> 02:47:18.370]  I try to replace it with maybe a
[02:47:18.490 --> 02:47:23.730]  small handful of peanuts and some fruit because sometimes I want some crunch and I used to just reach for a candy bar or
[02:47:23.730 --> 02:47:25.210]  a bag of chips or some some crap
[02:47:25.210 --> 02:47:30.610]  But now I just eat like some pistachios or some almonds and then some fruit to go with that to give it some sweetness and
[02:47:30.610 --> 02:47:32.610]  Some flavor and get that crunch
[02:47:32.650 --> 02:47:38.330]  That's the kind of stuff that I like to snack on a lot of pasta lots of fruits and vegetables lots of salads lots of
[02:47:38.330 --> 02:47:39.690]  stuff like that
[02:47:39.690 --> 02:47:45.330]  Yeah, definitely not the Suzy homemaker type dude. I am not the the super chef vegetarian guy
[02:47:45.650 --> 02:47:49.370]  You said something about eggs. I won't fry up eggs and eat them
[02:47:49.370 --> 02:47:50.490]  I won't have an omelet
[02:47:50.490 --> 02:47:55.210]  But I will eat something that's got eggs in it like a cake or something like that
[02:47:55.210 --> 02:47:56.170]  If I do eat, you know what?
[02:47:56.170 --> 02:47:59.890]  I mean like I would eat something like that, but I'm not just gonna go fry up some eggs
[02:48:00.210 --> 02:48:06.410]  So I replied to your rambly ass message with a bunch of rambles myself. I hope I made some sense for you
[02:48:06.410 --> 02:48:11.090]  I do appreciate you sending me messages and please send me some more messages. I would appreciate it
[02:48:11.650 --> 02:48:14.050]  All right, I want to thank everybody for the emails that they sent
[02:48:14.050 --> 02:48:18.930]  I really appreciate the interaction from all of my friends and listeners if you want to send me an email
[02:48:18.930 --> 02:48:23.050]  It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com. I would love to hear what you have to say
[02:48:23.050 --> 02:48:26.610]  I would also like it if you follow me on all of the social media sites. I am on Twitter
[02:48:26.610 --> 02:48:31.290]  It's at GF YH podcast and I'm on Facebook under grow from your heart podcast
[02:48:31.290 --> 02:48:36.810]  Just give us a search if you were on Instagram check me out there. It's I re underscore genetics
[02:48:36.810 --> 02:48:42.010]  I use my seed company name. I read genetics on Instagram. Check us out. I post a bunch of great cannabis
[02:48:42.730 --> 02:48:47.730]  Photography. Are you guys that's all the emails and comments I've got for you for tonight. I need to take a quick dab
[02:48:47.730 --> 02:48:53.070]  I need to take a drink and then we're gonna come back with a couple of really simple grow tips that will really help out
[02:48:53.070 --> 02:48:55.410]  Your garden hang on for just one second and I will be right back
[02:48:56.930 --> 02:49:03.050]  Yeah, alright I am back and I'm officially dabbed the fuck out once again big shout out to my friends at turpex
[02:49:03.370 --> 02:49:07.010]  All right, so I said I was going to come back and give you guys some grow tips
[02:49:07.530 --> 02:49:11.730]  The other day I was talking to a friend and he was telling me about his garden and he said he was running
[02:49:12.050 --> 02:49:16.450]  Three or four different strains and he was running his lights 24 hours a day
[02:49:16.450 --> 02:49:21.970]  So the plants are in a vegetative stage and he said that one strain in the room is trying to start
[02:49:22.130 --> 02:49:27.290]  Flowering while they are in veg and he said he's ran this cut a couple of times and it's done it both times
[02:49:27.770 --> 02:49:33.330]  So he was freaking out very curious why his plants are auto flowering when they're not auto flower plants
[02:49:34.090 --> 02:49:38.150]  There are a couple things that can make this happen in my opinion from what this guy says
[02:49:38.150 --> 02:49:41.970]  I feel like his plants are root bound when your plants get root bound
[02:49:41.970 --> 02:49:44.570]  That means that the roots have filled up the entire soil area
[02:49:44.570 --> 02:49:46.890]  There's no more space in the container for roots to grow
[02:49:47.010 --> 02:49:53.130]  Now the plant is growing the roots are pressing up against themselves and that plant knows my container is full
[02:49:53.130 --> 02:49:56.410]  There's nowhere for me to stretch out my legs. I've got to do something
[02:49:56.890 --> 02:50:02.210]  The only real thing that a cannabis plant can do at that point is flower. It wants to create buds
[02:50:02.210 --> 02:50:07.730]  It wants to make calyxes or pistils or pollen so that it can breed and continue on the species
[02:50:07.850 --> 02:50:14.310]  So that plant goes into flower mode to protect itself. That's basically the plants job. It says oh shit. I could die
[02:50:14.310 --> 02:50:17.890]  I better start flowering. So that's what I think is happening
[02:50:17.890 --> 02:50:23.530]  I think his plants are getting root bound a root root bound plants will show signs of auto flower
[02:50:23.530 --> 02:50:26.330]  And if you don't up pot them or fix the problem
[02:50:26.330 --> 02:50:29.490]  They will go into full flower on you and you won't be able to stop it
[02:50:30.450 --> 02:50:31.250]  All right
[02:50:31.250 --> 02:50:37.450]  Another thing that I think may be causing these plants to go root bound or plants could go root bound from this is a lack
[02:50:37.450 --> 02:50:42.730]  Of light a lot of times I noticed that if a plant is not getting enough light at the very bottom area
[02:50:43.010 --> 02:50:48.810]  That's where it will start to auto flower your very bottom branches will start showing calyx pistils popping up early or
[02:50:49.610 --> 02:50:52.250]  It's too early they're popping up early they shouldn't be there yet
[02:50:52.250 --> 02:50:59.170]  That's probably because the lower part of that plant is not getting enough light all of the leaves up top or the plants next door
[02:50:59.170 --> 02:51:05.810]  Are blocking out the light and that plant is going to auto flower because it's not getting light and it's trying to protect itself
[02:51:05.810 --> 02:51:06.690]  once again
[02:51:06.690 --> 02:51:13.730]  This type of thing is way more common if you're using like t5 or t8 or fluorescents or maybe LEDs if you're using gavitas
[02:51:13.730 --> 02:51:17.770]  You won't see as much auto flower from lack of light as you do with the smaller
[02:51:18.530 --> 02:51:22.650]  Compact fluorescents and stuff like that. So a lot of the problem could be lack of light
[02:51:23.170 --> 02:51:28.250]  Or another thing that is very possible is not a proper light cycle
[02:51:28.370 --> 02:51:33.410]  Plants flower based on photo period every plant has got what it's called a critical photo period
[02:51:33.970 --> 02:51:39.090]  Some plants will actually begin to flower under 14 hours of daylight. You don't have to reduce it to 12
[02:51:39.090 --> 02:51:44.010]  That's why outdoors you see some plants starting to flower before our natural cycle gets to 12 12
[02:51:44.090 --> 02:51:50.410]  So there is a critical period on your plants and some plants will flower early also if you stress plants
[02:51:50.410 --> 02:51:53.390]  They will start to flower on you because they know that they're going to die
[02:51:53.490 --> 02:51:58.410]  So the main three causes of an auto flowering plant that is not meant to auto flower are root bound
[02:51:58.610 --> 02:52:03.830]  Not enough light and maybe not a correct photo period for that particular cultivar
[02:52:03.970 --> 02:52:08.410]  So the first thing I would always check is to make sure your plants not root bound if it is all you've got to do
[02:52:08.410 --> 02:52:12.610]  Is put it into a bigger pot? It's really not that much of a challenge if you're starting to flower
[02:52:12.730 --> 02:52:17.330]  I usually try not to transplant plants during the flowering phase because that can really shock them
[02:52:17.330 --> 02:52:21.730]  But if you're severely root bound go for it, just do it because your plant will appreciate it
[02:52:21.730 --> 02:52:25.730]  It's gonna spend some energy stretching out its roots, but it'll be worth it. You'll get a bigger plant
[02:52:25.730 --> 02:52:27.730]  You'll get a better quality product if you do it correctly
[02:52:27.850 --> 02:52:32.810]  Just be extra careful not to stress out your plant disrupt those exposed roots too much when you're doing the up pot
[02:52:32.850 --> 02:52:35.250]  All right, so that's enough for that question
[02:52:35.250 --> 02:52:39.690]  The other question that a friend brought to me was why are these plants not finishing?
[02:52:39.690 --> 02:52:45.010]  He's like these plants have been in this garden for 14 weeks. They're still airy. They're still fluffy. The calyxes are not done
[02:52:45.010 --> 02:52:47.010]  The trichomes are not amber
[02:52:47.210 --> 02:52:52.170]  The pistils have not gotten orange yet. Everything is still going. I've got more time to go. What is happening?
[02:52:52.370 --> 02:52:55.930]  So this kind of goes back to earlier when I was talking about the critical period
[02:52:56.330 --> 02:53:00.970]  Plants that flower for a long time are usually from a more tropical climate somewhere near the equator
[02:53:00.970 --> 02:53:07.130]  So they get longer days. So these plants are expecting the season to only change by about an hour or two
[02:53:07.330 --> 02:53:13.410]  So what I would recommend to make these plants speed up their flowering process is around week 9 or 10
[02:53:13.730 --> 02:53:18.170]  Start reducing the timer on your daylight cycle. So instead of going 12 12
[02:53:18.170 --> 02:53:22.210]  Maybe start going to like 11 hours and 30 minutes and then you know
[02:53:22.210 --> 02:53:27.130]  Just start working it down until finally you're down at like 8 hours and then those plants will really start to speed up
[02:53:27.130 --> 02:53:31.630]  It'll make the plants get more dense. It'll make the trichome start to start to turn amber
[02:53:31.630 --> 02:53:34.570]  The plants will know that winter is coming. You just got to tell them
[02:53:35.250 --> 02:53:40.210]  If nothing changes in that room those plants will not change because they're just used to being out by the equator
[02:53:40.210 --> 02:53:44.050]  They're used to being in the jungle somewhere or it's sunshiny. They're getting all kinds of Sun
[02:53:44.450 --> 02:53:51.110]  They're just not ready for the time to end. All right, you guys that is all of the episode I've got for you this week
[02:53:51.110 --> 02:53:54.490]  I feel like I've been going on for a long time by myself. It's a 30 minute episode already
[02:53:54.490 --> 02:53:57.050]  So I'm gonna start wrapping up the show. I hope you learned a whole bunch
[02:53:57.050 --> 02:54:01.890]  I want to thank everybody for listening. If you have any questions off of what I just said

[02:54:29.870 --> 02:54:33.130]  Until next time take a fat dad and give your mom a hug for me
[02:54:51.270 --> 02:54:56.230]  To chair like he's sitting there once almost all make it
[02:54:59.150 --> 02:55:04.550]  Never changes his mood in a painting on the wall, right?
[02:55:42.510 --> 02:55:44.510]  I smell a cornbread
[02:56:23.240 --> 02:56:25.240]  Oh
[02:57:38.080 --> 02:57:42.080]  Oh, just now

[02:57:48.080 --> 02:57:52.080]  Oh, tastes more to break
[02:57:52.080 --> 02:57:54.080]  More to break

[02:58:25.320 --> 02:58:41.780]  Sweet dogs go
[02:58:41.780 --> 02:58:46.780]  Fresh gifts don't do it all
[02:58:46.780 --> 02:58:51.440]  Still just a kid
[02:58:53.770 --> 02:58:55.770]  Riding in
