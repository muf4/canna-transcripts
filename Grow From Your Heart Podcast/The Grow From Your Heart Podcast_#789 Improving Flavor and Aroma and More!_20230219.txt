[00:29.230 --> 00:34.990]  Welcome to the podcast everybody. I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff. This of course is episode
[00:35.870 --> 00:42.190]  789 of the grow from your heart podcast. Yes. I know I said 789 on the last episode. I do apologize
[00:42.190 --> 00:46.570]  I'm not the best at counting but I am pretty good at growing in this episode
[00:46.570 --> 00:49.110]  We are going to give away a free pack of seeds. That's right
[00:49.110 --> 00:55.170]  I've teamed up with my friends at seeds here now calm to give you a free pack of iri genetic seeds. Stay tuned
[00:55.170 --> 00:57.330]  We'll talk more about that later in this episode
[00:57.330 --> 01:00.490]  I do have a lot of fun stuff to ramble about here at the start of the show
[01:00.490 --> 01:02.850]  I want to start off by giving a couple of shout outs
[01:02.850 --> 01:06.610]  I want to give a big shout out to a comedian by the name of Joe list. That's right
[01:06.610 --> 01:11.630]  I got to see Joe list live at comedy works Joe list kind of downplays his comedy
[01:11.630 --> 01:15.530]  He doesn't talk about how many tickets he sells about how many people show up to his show
[01:15.570 --> 01:21.290]  He's kind of self-deprecating and then when he show up to the comedy show you realize he's doing much better than he leads on
[01:21.410 --> 01:22.570]  Big shout out big
[01:22.570 --> 01:24.570]  Thank you to Joe list for a great comedy show
[01:24.770 --> 01:30.770]  Also a big shout out to comedy works for hosting a great show and of course a big shout out to Zara for being a perfect
[01:30.770 --> 01:33.610]  Comedy show day. All right, let's move forward
[01:33.610 --> 01:38.990]  The next thing to talk about is orange chasm seeds will be back in stock on I redirect very soon
[01:38.990 --> 01:42.290]  That's right. The seeds have been harvested. They are in a little container
[01:42.290 --> 01:46.210]  All they need to do is be counted and packaged into individual packages
[01:46.210 --> 01:50.050]  And then I can put them on the website and get them to you. I will do that very soon
[01:50.050 --> 01:55.570]  I don't have an exact time or date planned or in mind for when I'm going to do that. Life is very busy
[01:55.570 --> 01:57.250]  I've got a lot of things going on
[01:57.250 --> 01:59.170]  I want to get them out as soon as possible
[01:59.170 --> 02:04.770]  the easiest way for you to stay in touch and stay updated on how to get that drop as soon as it happens is
[02:04.810 --> 02:12.050]  The first people that will get the update is the patreon members the people that participate on patreon at the seven dollar and ten cent
[02:12.050 --> 02:14.050]  Above level will get the first notification
[02:14.450 --> 02:19.090]  Shortly after that the people that subscribe to the four dollar and twenty cent subscription on patreon
[02:19.090 --> 02:23.770]  They will get a notification once I feel like enough people from patreon have gotten their seeds
[02:23.770 --> 02:27.890]  Then I will send out a newsletter to sign up for that newsletter go to my website
[02:27.890 --> 02:32.930]  I read genetics calm scroll down to the bottom. There'll be a spot to type in your email address
[02:33.130 --> 02:37.810]  You will get a notification that says you have successfully subscribed to that email newsletter
[02:38.010 --> 02:40.290]  Then when I do the drop for the orange chasm
[02:40.290 --> 02:45.170]  You will get an email with a link directly to I redirect so you can grab those seeds
[02:45.210 --> 02:48.770]  Then I will also make an update and post a link to the discord server
[02:48.770 --> 02:53.010]  I will go to discord somewhere in the irie army discord. I will make sure everybody sees it
[02:53.010 --> 02:56.630]  It will say hey, there are orange chasm seeds here. Click this link
[02:56.630 --> 02:58.610]  So it will go in the order of patreon
[02:58.610 --> 03:05.130]  It will be the patreon 710 members then the patreon 420 members then the newsletter then shortly after that
[03:05.130 --> 03:06.490]  It will be the discord server
[03:06.490 --> 03:12.450]  So make sure you're either on patreon the newsletter or discord the newsletter and discord are absolutely free to join
[03:12.450 --> 03:18.730]  So, please do jump on that. But of course patreon will get first dibs at the new drop of the orange chasm seeds
[03:18.970 --> 03:20.670]  Alright, where do we go from there?
[03:20.670 --> 03:20.890]  Oh
[03:20.890 --> 03:26.050]  It says here to remind you that every order does come with freebies and some of those freebies will be
[03:26.130 --> 03:32.290]  Testers if you do get testers, I do highly invite you to join the discord server on the discord server
[03:32.330 --> 03:35.350]  There is a tab that says I read genetics testers
[03:35.350 --> 03:40.370]  if you click on that you can see the progress of all the tester seeds that I've sent out from the people that have
[03:40.370 --> 03:43.650]  Decided to join and participate in the discord tester tab
[03:43.890 --> 03:46.970]  If you want to post one or two pictures there, that is great
[03:46.970 --> 03:49.450]  If you want to post a weekly update there, that is awesome
[03:49.450 --> 03:53.370]  If you want to post full written out grow reports there that is just as great
[03:53.370 --> 03:57.690]  I want as much details and information as you want to share if you're one of those people that
[03:57.770 --> 03:59.610]  Wants to type out a whole bunch of shit
[03:59.610 --> 04:06.930]  I'm really interested in reading all of it post all your details or info type about your gear your equipment your humidity your temperature what you're
[04:06.930 --> 04:08.930]  feeding and then post photos or
[04:08.930 --> 04:11.130]  Just post a picture and say what strain it is
[04:11.130 --> 04:16.570]  The most important part if you are going to post in the tester tab is please do include what strain you are testing
[04:16.570 --> 04:22.210]  I try to include a name or at least a cross on the package to identify it so you can clearly talk about what it
[04:22.210 --> 04:25.610]  Is please do include that so we know what you're talking about on the tester tab
[04:25.610 --> 04:31.570]  But when you do order from I redirect everything will come with some free seeds some of those may be tester seeds
[04:31.570 --> 04:35.690]  It will be clearly marked on there if they are tester seeds, you'll get a little I don't say testers
[04:35.690 --> 04:37.890]  You'll get a little card with a link to the discord
[04:37.890 --> 04:41.250]  There's a QR code you can scan that that should take you right to the discord
[04:41.250 --> 04:44.490]  You can join hang out and talk about all the testing on there
[04:44.490 --> 04:47.810]  I think that's all the rambling I want to do here at the start of the show
[04:47.810 --> 04:54.010]  I do have a couple of great emails. Let's jump right into those. The first one says yo Rasta Jeff
[04:54.010 --> 04:58.850]  I would like to start by thanking you. That's a good way to start a message. You're welcome, bro
[04:58.850 --> 05:04.890]  It goes on to say I purchased the bundle off of I redirect as a Christmas gift to myself and man. Did you deliver?
[05:05.130 --> 05:08.610]  Yes, occasionally I will post random bundles to I redirect
[05:09.250 --> 05:13.610]  and I put a bundle pack and I tell you how many seeds comes in that pack and I put a very
[05:13.890 --> 05:19.930]  Greatly discounted price on that bundle and then people buy that bundle and they don't know what they're gonna get. It's like a prize bag
[05:19.930 --> 05:22.330]  It's like a grab bag. There's just a bunch of random seeds in there
[05:22.330 --> 05:25.770]  I make sure to load it up and make it well worth the price that you paid
[05:25.770 --> 05:28.650]  But you have no idea what's coming. It could be new stuff. It could be old stuff
[05:28.650 --> 05:33.450]  It could be regs. It could be femmes. It could be unreleased shit. It could be overstock shit either way
[05:33.450 --> 05:36.230]  I make sure that you're gonna be happy with what you get if it's older stuff
[05:36.230 --> 05:39.690]  There's so much of it if it's new stuff, you're gonna be blown away by the cool shit
[05:39.690 --> 05:43.050]  You've never seen I also sneak in some testers and freebies and all of those
[05:43.050 --> 05:48.510]  But yes, occasionally I do throw out those bundles and since you've got faith in me and trust me just to load it up for you
[05:48.650 --> 05:51.530]  That's why I really hook you up with those. Anyway, I should keep moving
[05:51.530 --> 05:53.450]  It says the new packaging is awesome
[05:53.450 --> 05:54.530]  And in a weird way
[05:54.530 --> 05:59.650]  It seemed like you knew what I want or what I don't have or what I wanted to buy and you threw that in there
[05:59.650 --> 06:03.570]  So thanks again. There's a lot of cool compliments in there the new packaging. Thank you
[06:03.570 --> 06:08.170]  If you guys have not seen the new packaging from I read genetics hit I redirect grab some seeds
[06:08.370 --> 06:12.210]  There's a good chance that the John lemons will come in the new packaging
[06:12.410 --> 06:17.530]  The Big Mountain fudge cake will definitely be in the new packaging and then some of the fems have their own custom
[06:18.010 --> 06:23.250]  Package designs on there. So grab some seeds it goes on. Anyway, it says on to my grow question
[06:23.250 --> 06:27.810]  That is the point of this right? Do you have any tips on keeping a grow room warmer in the winter?
[06:27.810 --> 06:33.510]  That's a really good question. I'm sure if you've been following along, you know that when I switch from LED lighting
[06:33.510 --> 06:40.870]  I went from HBS to LED lighting and kind of ruined a whole entire crop. I stupidly it was my decision my move
[06:40.870 --> 06:42.410]  I did that in the middle of the winter
[06:42.410 --> 06:48.250]  It was negative 17 degrees outside and I decided to take down the HBS lights and hang up LEDs
[06:48.250 --> 06:52.450]  And guess what that room got super fucking cold because I was relying on those
[06:52.530 --> 06:57.130]  HBS lights to keep that room warm and it did not work with the LEDs the LEDs put off
[06:57.370 --> 07:01.670]  Basically, no heat compared what to compare to what the HBS lights were doing
[07:01.730 --> 07:07.830]  So I have struggled with this before I do need to keep that grow room that grow space warm my solution
[07:07.830 --> 07:11.850]  And you said you can't do that or don't want to do that. But my solution was to hang more lights
[07:11.850 --> 07:13.650]  I just put the HBS light back up
[07:13.650 --> 07:18.970]  So the LEDs are where they should be in their area and then I just put HBS up over on the side and that's what's
[07:18.970 --> 07:23.410]  Heating up the room now. It's basically working as extra light and as a heater. All right, it does go on
[07:23.410 --> 07:26.130]  It says my wife and I recently purchased a new home
[07:27.090 --> 07:29.090]  Congratulations brother. That is a big thing
[07:29.130 --> 07:34.370]  Especially at this time it goes on it says and in this home my new grow will be in the basement
[07:34.370 --> 07:37.690]  That's that's perfect. We all started in the basement, bro. That's where most of us start
[07:37.690 --> 07:44.530]  It says she is always hot and I am always cold. So we compromise and just keep the house cold. That makes sense
[07:44.970 --> 07:51.090]  It was 58 degrees in there yesterday morning. That is kind of cold for a grow space. It says the room isn't huge
[07:51.090 --> 07:54.650]  It's about a hundred and ten square feet. So that's about a like a 10 by 11 room
[07:54.650 --> 07:59.770]  I also don't do not own HBS or ceramic metal halide fixtures anymore
[07:59.770 --> 08:04.050]  I'm hesitant to use a standard hot coil space heater due to fire risks
[08:04.050 --> 08:07.930]  I have some ideas, but this is another one of those what would Rasta Jeff do?
[08:08.610 --> 08:12.210]  Situations from our friend and they call themselves F a plant count
[08:12.210 --> 08:18.530]  I like that F that plant count, although I do strictly follow the plant count here in Colorado because of all of the rules
[08:18.530 --> 08:21.690]  But I know what you mean F a plant count. So that is a great question
[08:21.690 --> 08:26.330]  How do we keep a basement grow space warm in the winter? I did write down a few ideas
[08:26.330 --> 08:31.410]  Of course, my first option would be just to get a safe heater. I know you don't want one of those dangerous
[08:32.050 --> 08:37.410]  Space heaters, but you can get a quality heater now. It's a it's 2023. It's not the 80s
[08:37.410 --> 08:42.130]  It's not the 70s anymore where those heaters are super dangerous. There are quality heaters available
[08:42.130 --> 08:44.890]  You can buy an industrial heater or a residential heater
[08:45.090 --> 08:49.130]  You can set it on the floor in a safe spot or you can put it up on the ceiling in a safe spot
[08:49.130 --> 08:51.610]  you can mount it make sure you follow all of the
[08:52.810 --> 08:55.190]  Manufacturers recommended rules and safety precautions
[08:55.190 --> 08:57.010]  I got to say that to keep myself out of trouble
[08:57.050 --> 09:02.050]  And everything you do is your responsibility and your fault also I should say that just to keep that's for just for legal purposes here
[09:02.170 --> 09:04.330]  But I would recommend just a normal small heater
[09:04.330 --> 09:08.810]  It's a hundred and ten square feet room a very small heater should be able to warm that space
[09:08.810 --> 09:11.970]  You can run that heater when the lights are on you can run that heater when the lights are off
[09:12.090 --> 09:15.810]  That is one option. I would get a heater and something called a cap switch
[09:15.810 --> 09:21.330]  Let's talk about what a cap switch is. Many people aren't familiar with these types of devices. They're great great devices
[09:21.330 --> 09:25.450]  They make them for all kinds of different things that do you can figure out how to do you can operate a whole row
[09:25.450 --> 09:29.430]  Grow room, uh, you could automate an entire room with just a few cap switches
[09:29.430 --> 09:30.690]  If you really think about what you're doing
[09:30.690 --> 09:35.010]  So a cap switch the switch plugs into the wall where the plug-in goes
[09:35.010 --> 09:40.250]  So the first step is to get the cap switch plug it into the wall. It's got a thermostat on it
[09:40.250 --> 09:44.050]  So you turn it to the range that you want? I think it'll be within three to five degrees
[09:44.130 --> 09:48.450]  So you're gonna get like 70 to 75 turn it there 70 to 75 degrees
[09:48.450 --> 09:52.610]  Maybe a little hotter 72 to 77 maybe a little hotter depends on what you want to do
[09:53.250 --> 09:56.410]  But turn it to where you want it set it on the range at which you want it
[09:56.410 --> 09:58.970]  Then you plug the heater into that cap switch
[09:59.250 --> 10:05.630]  Then you turn the heater knob to where it's on at medium or high however much however much intensity you want that heater to bang
[10:05.630 --> 10:09.090]  Out maybe if you put it on medium, it won't be banging high intensity all the time
[10:09.090 --> 10:13.710]  It may last longer less risk a problem less risk of fire. So you turn the heater on medium
[10:13.710 --> 10:18.470]  It's got one of those manual those switches that you have to turn don't get a digital heater because that will not work
[10:18.530 --> 10:22.210]  With your cap switch you got to get the analog kind with the knobs that you can turn
[10:22.410 --> 10:27.050]  So get the turning knob turn it on to medium get that bitch going plug it into the cap switch
[10:27.250 --> 10:30.330]  Then there's a cord that comes from the cap switch
[10:30.330 --> 10:33.730]  That's got a thermometer on it hang that in the middle of the room
[10:33.850 --> 10:40.690]  Maybe right above canopy high then that thermometer will hang right above the canopy and whenever it gets too high or too low for that
[10:40.690 --> 10:43.810]  Temperature if it's too low if it's under 75 degrees
[10:43.890 --> 10:44.690]  That'll say hey
[10:44.690 --> 10:47.650]  It's under 75 degrees and it will turn on power to that switch
[10:47.770 --> 10:52.730]  Which will turn on the heater the heater will heat up as the room heats up that thermometer hanging in the middle of the
[10:52.730 --> 10:55.730]  Room will say hey, it's as hot as we need it to be and it'll tell that switch
[10:55.730 --> 10:58.970]  Hey turn off the power to this this plug-in right here
[10:58.970 --> 11:03.010]  So all you're doing is turning off and on the power to that plug-in by using a thermometer
[11:03.010 --> 11:07.610]  It'll say I'm within the range or I'm not within the range and if you've got a heater that's got a switch on it that
[11:07.610 --> 11:12.010]  You could turn off on medium high low. However, that will work but a digital
[11:12.730 --> 11:17.330]  Heater will not work for this situation. You can also do the opposite with an air conditioner
[11:17.410 --> 11:20.890]  If you do a cap switch on an air conditioner set it low set it high
[11:20.930 --> 11:23.250]  You can tell that air conditioner to come on
[11:23.250 --> 11:26.570]  You can put as many devices on as many cap switches as you want in the room
[11:26.570 --> 11:31.450]  They sell them for humidity with a humidist at on there. They sell them for heaters. They sell them for coolers
[11:31.450 --> 11:35.950]  You can automate all kinds of things with cap switches. So think about those things a little bit
[11:35.950 --> 11:40.650]  I do have some notes that I completely abandoned here. So the cap switch is your first choice
[11:41.650 --> 11:45.570]  Heater is your first choice heater or the cap switch is your next choice then
[11:46.090 --> 11:48.690]  If you've got two rooms, this is what I've done before
[11:48.890 --> 11:52.130]  I've got a a veg room and a flower room next to each other
[11:52.130 --> 11:57.370]  I simply vent the heat from the veg room into the flower room and the flower room is dark
[11:57.370 --> 12:00.770]  So at night, it's just heating up that room using the hot air
[12:00.770 --> 12:03.850]  So it's just venting that I'm venting that hot air from the veg room
[12:03.930 --> 12:08.610]  over there to the flower room wall to sleep and that will help keep that room warm a little bit and then
[12:08.690 --> 12:11.530]  That's got a carbon filter and a dehumidifier in the flower room
[12:11.530 --> 12:16.130]  So it'll clean that air up a little bit and then send that out of the room and it's just replacing the air constantly
[12:16.490 --> 12:20.850]  But vent that the veg room heat into the flower room may be another idea
[12:21.290 --> 12:24.930]  Here's another thing you can think about is flip the schedule
[12:24.930 --> 12:28.690]  I know that may sound crazy, but we do this in the summer to keep the rooms cool
[12:28.730 --> 12:31.370]  Why not do this in the winter to keep the rooms warm?
[12:31.490 --> 12:34.370]  It's always going to be a little bit warmer during the day
[12:34.730 --> 12:40.130]  Maybe only just a few degrees especially right now. It's snowing like a motherfucker outside in Colorado
[12:40.170 --> 12:44.690]  But it's only gonna be a few degrees but during the day we're gonna get a few degrees warmer at night
[12:44.690 --> 12:46.250]  It's gonna be a few degrees colder
[12:46.250 --> 12:51.790]  What if you put your lights on during the night to try to keep that part of the the cycle a little bit warmer?
[12:51.790 --> 12:58.010]  That may help you out that may keep things dead even which may help you out just a little bit a co2 burner
[12:58.130 --> 13:02.570]  Maybe have you thought about adding a co2 burner co2 burner has a lot of good benefits
[13:02.570 --> 13:04.570]  It's going to make your plants grow bigger
[13:05.250 --> 13:08.090]  Faster and more robust. It'll help you use more nutrients
[13:08.290 --> 13:11.050]  You can use a little bit warmer room in the summertime
[13:11.050 --> 13:16.010]  But in the winter that co2 burner will heat up the grow room. It hooks up to the natural gas
[13:16.090 --> 13:20.750]  It works like a pilot light except it's like multiple pilot lights in a room depending on how big you buy
[13:20.750 --> 13:22.090]  You don't need a big one for this room
[13:22.090 --> 13:27.650]  But you could just use that co2 burner it will burn the co2 and at the same time it will heat up the room
[13:27.650 --> 13:31.770]  I know that's if you're gonna do that do a heater, but why not a co2 burner?
[13:31.770 --> 13:37.570]  It's gonna be just as effective and if there's just as many if not less risks, it's probably equal
[13:37.570 --> 13:41.130]  Anyway, here we go. Since I said risks, let me get to the next part of my notes
[13:41.130 --> 13:44.010]  It says smoke alarm and fire extinguisher
[13:44.010 --> 13:47.050]  If you're going to use a heater if you're going to use a co2 burner
[13:47.050 --> 13:52.010]  I highly highly recommend that you do add a smoke alarm and a fire
[13:52.170 --> 13:57.030]  Extinguisher if you don't already have that in the grow space you guys every grow space should have a fire
[13:57.430 --> 14:03.750]  Extinguisher available and possibly a smoke detector either inside or outside of that grow space put the fire extinguisher
[14:03.950 --> 14:09.550]  outside of the grow space if you have a grow space where the door closes have the fire extinguisher outside because if a fire does
[14:09.550 --> 14:10.150]  Happen in there
[14:10.150 --> 14:12.870]  You don't have to go in there to get the fire extinguisher to put it out
[14:12.870 --> 14:16.050]  You want to be able to kick the door open and careful the doorknob may be hot
[14:16.050 --> 14:20.790]  We've all seen the movie backdraft, but open the door start spraying be prepared
[14:20.790 --> 14:25.710]  So have that fire extinguisher and that smoke alarm. All right, let me check on the notes. Make sure I didn't miss anything
[14:26.230 --> 14:30.910]  All right, it looks like I covered all of the notes for this question my friend F a plant count
[14:30.910 --> 14:34.310]  Thank you for the great question. I do see your name on patreon all the time
[14:34.310 --> 14:37.710]  I see your name pop up on the YouTube a lot. Thank you for all the support, bro
[14:37.710 --> 14:41.350]  And of course, thank you for the great question. I hope I was able to help you out
[14:41.350 --> 14:45.270]  If you've got any follow-up questions, please do reach out. You know how to contact me
[14:45.270 --> 14:45.790]  All right
[14:45.790 --> 14:51.470]  I've got another message here on the table that I would like to read this one came from my friend shoe trader 101 on patreon
[14:51.470 --> 14:56.290]  And it goes a little bit like this. It says Rasta Jeff. I'm not sure how this happened
[14:56.290 --> 15:02.510]  But from my last run to this run, I noticed a lack of smell coming from the plants during the flowering stage
[15:02.670 --> 15:10.110]  I'm not sure what causes this my very first run was successful with all the smell and everything you could possibly think of I haven't
[15:10.110 --> 15:12.430]  Changed anything. I still use build a soil
[15:12.710 --> 15:19.630]  3.0 along with insect frass build a flower and other items that you can purchase directly from build a soil per their
[15:19.990 --> 15:23.270]  Recommendation big up to build a soil. They don't pay me. They don't sponsor the show
[15:23.270 --> 15:28.590]  I honestly don't use them but all of the organic guys that grow with organics and do the build a soil program
[15:28.590 --> 15:33.150]  I hear great success and great success stories with that product with that product line
[15:33.150 --> 15:37.510]  And they've also got great customer service and they're cool fucking people and their Instagram is super cool
[15:37.510 --> 15:39.070]  So they've never paid me
[15:39.070 --> 15:40.350]  I don't do a lot of business with them
[15:40.350 --> 15:42.570]  but big shout out to build a soil if you're a
[15:42.950 --> 15:47.870]  One of the the bed guys the the beds that does the live soil beds if you're a regenerative guy
[15:48.030 --> 15:51.070]  What are the guys who just pull the roots out and put the shit right back in there?
[15:51.070 --> 15:54.830]  I can't even think of what that's called. You guys are just keep going the no-till no-till guys
[15:54.830 --> 15:57.630]  I recommend build a soil to those kind of folks all the time
[15:57.990 --> 16:01.990]  So you're using a lot of build a soil products and most of the stuff per their recommendation
[16:02.070 --> 16:06.390]  It says a lot of people would say that this is due that the lack of smell is due to genetics
[16:06.510 --> 16:13.390]  But I have your stuff lit farms raw genetics and exotic genetics soul fire top dog and more bro
[16:13.390 --> 16:17.390]  Those are some of the best breeders on the planet in my opinion you hit some of my favorites in there
[16:17.390 --> 16:23.070]  So it's definitely not a genetics issue and your last run was good. So it says any feedback would help
[16:23.070 --> 16:29.350]  I'm in three five gallon pots and one seven gallon pot and I do pH my water
[16:29.350 --> 16:29.910]  All right
[16:29.910 --> 16:35.830]  So our friend shoe trader 101 from Instagram is having a problem or their last run smelled delicious
[16:35.830 --> 16:39.790]  Everything was perfect. But this run does not have any aroma and flavor
[16:39.790 --> 16:45.190]  We're gonna try to diagnose and figure out why with honestly the little bit of information. I've got here. I don't know the
[16:45.590 --> 16:50.950]  The the VPD I don't know the lighting I don't know a lot about this other than some build a soil products
[16:50.950 --> 16:53.910]  So let's let's dig into some of my ideas. I
[16:54.550 --> 16:56.430]  started off by talking about
[16:56.430 --> 17:00.350]  Temp and humidity VPD. How is the temp and humidity in your grow space?
[17:00.710 --> 17:05.110]  We all know that heat will also let's talk about one thing before we get there something
[17:05.110 --> 17:09.790]  I was just talking about with the last ramble that I got on. This could be a seasonal issue
[17:10.270 --> 17:13.230]  I noticed that since I'm dealing with different conditions
[17:13.510 --> 17:18.510]  Outdoors during the winter and different conditions in the fall and the spring in the summer because I'm in Colorado
[17:18.510 --> 17:21.750]  Our seasons are drastically noticeable. You could tell the difference in seasons
[17:21.830 --> 17:25.270]  So since I'm here, I do notice that some of my crops are easier
[17:25.270 --> 17:28.550]  They come out better my winter crop my fall crop the one that's done
[17:28.630 --> 17:31.950]  Since I've got them scheduled the third crop of the year the one the one that comes around
[17:32.110 --> 17:37.950]  Halloween that one's always one of my best crops of the year if it's for a smokable flower or for seeded flower
[17:37.950 --> 17:44.270]  It's always the most successful is my Halloween run for some reason. I don't know why I don't I think it may be the gear
[17:44.270 --> 17:46.270]  And dealing I don't have to cool the rooms as much
[17:46.510 --> 17:50.310]  So that's what I'm getting at. Let me talk about that. I've kind of segmented my way into that
[17:50.310 --> 17:54.390]  I don't have to cool the room as much so I think I get a better stickier tastier product
[17:54.390 --> 17:58.790]  Is your room too hot was your last run in a dry season in a warm season?
[17:58.790 --> 18:02.790]  Did the room get too hot also, maybe perhaps did the room get too dry?
[18:03.110 --> 18:08.550]  Maybe you're dealing with conditions outside that it's hard to correct the indoors in your room got a little bit different
[18:08.550 --> 18:10.870]  Maybe the last crop it was a different season
[18:10.870 --> 18:17.190]  You had that outdoor or that outdoor cool that Halloween crop like I always get that super good. Maybe that was your last crop
[18:17.190 --> 18:22.470]  Maybe you're comparing that spring crop to your Halloween crop and they're gonna be totally different just because of outdoor
[18:22.950 --> 18:25.070]  Environmental conditions that just could be a thing
[18:25.070 --> 18:30.390]  I'm not certainly sure that that is it but I noticed that my crops are different here at different times of the year
[18:30.390 --> 18:34.710]  So it could be temperature. It could be humidity. It could be too wet. It could be too dry
[18:35.350 --> 18:41.870]  Too hot definitely volatilizes and burns off turps too dry doesn't allow turps to produce as much too moist
[18:41.870 --> 18:48.110]  We'll definitely stifle terpene production too cold might not be too bad for turps, but it is gonna slow down some shit
[18:48.390 --> 18:50.790]  So let's think about temperature humidity
[18:51.510 --> 18:55.870]  Then let's also think about airflow in the room. Is there too much airflow?
[18:55.870 --> 19:00.270]  Is it too windy imagine if your turps your plants your trichomes are just sitting there in the wind
[19:00.550 --> 19:04.750]  You know if you're on the boat if you're on a motorcycle if you got the windows down if you're in the convertible
[19:05.150 --> 19:08.430]  Maybe you just got too much wind on your face and you just feel all chafed all day
[19:08.430 --> 19:12.910]  Maybe the plants are getting the same thing in there, bro. Maybe they're just getting beat up by a fan again
[19:12.910 --> 19:14.470]  I'm not accusing. I'm not pointing fingers
[19:14.470 --> 19:20.630]  I'm just going through my mind looking in the grow room going what could possibly through my grow space saying what could possibly be
[19:21.070 --> 19:24.230]  Diminishing aroma and flavor and presence of terpenes in this grow space
[19:24.230 --> 19:27.910]  So I'm just checking off the list and seeing what we can identify in your grow
[19:28.710 --> 19:31.790]  So we're talking about air flows it too windy. Is it too stagnant?
[19:31.790 --> 19:34.470]  You're not are you not getting enough air exchange in there?
[19:34.470 --> 19:38.650]  Do we need to get rid of some air pull some fresh air in there that may be part of the situation?
[19:38.650 --> 19:43.110]  And I'm just looking from the top down. We're gonna get to the soil at the end here. We'll talk about all this stuff
[19:43.550 --> 19:48.750]  Did you have any issues were there any bugs if you had any bugs at all that will definitely slow down?
[19:49.510 --> 19:54.910]  Tricone production aroma flavor all of that stuff because the the plants will be focused on different things
[19:54.910 --> 19:59.550]  They'll just be more focused on protecting and replenishing the damage that the bugs are doing
[20:00.150 --> 20:06.670]  Did you see any visual problems? Did you get a microscope and look for any problems? Did you spray anything?
[20:07.350 --> 20:13.870]  Maybe something you sprayed may have changed the aroma and flavor then were you watering properly?
[20:13.870 --> 20:16.670]  Did you have any dry spells? Were you over watering? Did you?
[20:16.950 --> 20:18.470]  You're using the build of soil
[20:18.470 --> 20:23.590]  Did you replenish everything after you harvest it some of that stuff needs to be put back in did you add the bloom boosters?
[20:23.590 --> 20:28.150]  Did you add the aroma and flavor enhancers which they recommend? I don't know what that is from build the soil
[20:28.150 --> 20:31.670]  But I'm sure there's a product they say this gives you better flavor. This gives better aroma
[20:31.670 --> 20:34.750]  Did you use that because that may have helped out with you? So
[20:35.590 --> 20:39.950]  Did you over water? I think I said that did you underwater were you checking the soil carefully?
[20:39.950 --> 20:41.550]  It says you pH did
[20:41.550 --> 20:45.070]  Were you making sure that everything was perfect in the soil before you were watering?
[20:45.070 --> 20:48.990]  So maybe there was an issue with the soil. Maybe you didn't rebuild everything after the last harvest
[20:48.990 --> 20:52.590]  I'm not a soil expert. So maybe I could be a lack of microbes
[20:52.590 --> 20:56.190]  Maybe it could have been a feeding issue. There could have been a lot of things going on there
[20:56.750 --> 21:00.150]  Something I notice you said this was happening in the flowering stage
[21:00.150 --> 21:02.790]  but something else I notice is that a lot of people will have
[21:02.990 --> 21:07.630]  Really stinky plants all the way up to the end and then they don't dry and cure properly
[21:07.630 --> 21:10.030]  And that's where they lose a lot of the flavor and aroma
[21:10.030 --> 21:15.630]  So I'm curious I'm sure that by the time I've read this and by the time this podcast comes out that it will be harvest time
[21:15.630 --> 21:19.030]  Maybe it's dry cure and smoke time. How did these plants come out bro?
[21:19.030 --> 21:22.550]  Now at the end now that it's time to chop them down. How does it smell?
[21:22.550 --> 21:27.470]  How does it taste once you dried it and cured it then any did any of that flavor and aroma come out?
[21:27.470 --> 21:32.910]  It could be a dry and cure issue. Once again that comes to a relative humidity temperature darkness
[21:32.910 --> 21:36.910]  So I'm curious. I'm sure that by the time I've read this and by the time this podcast comes out
[21:36.910 --> 21:41.190]  That comes to a relative humidity temperature darkness where they kept in the dark
[21:41.470 --> 21:45.990]  Also were the lights too close to your plants when they were growing that could be something to think about too
[21:46.030 --> 21:49.630]  Were they closer or further away than last time that the plants grow taller?
[21:49.710 --> 21:54.030]  Did you lower or raise the light? Did you forget to raise the light or lower the light for some reason?
[21:54.030 --> 21:56.790]  I'm just throwing out there all the ideas that I could come up with
[21:57.550 --> 22:01.510]  The main thing to think about is what changed what is different than last time?
[22:02.190 --> 22:06.690]  That's why I always recommend taking a lot of notes. Did you write down everything you did last time?
[22:06.690 --> 22:12.210]  Did you write down everything you did this time set those notes side by side and say oh last time in week three
[22:12.210 --> 22:15.650]  I did this. Ah shit. I didn't do this at week three or I did do this
[22:15.650 --> 22:19.330]  It could be something you did or didn't do it could be an environmental change
[22:19.330 --> 22:25.650]  It could be something major or honestly, bro. It could be something very tiny did a product change to the airflow change
[22:25.650 --> 22:31.690]  Did your care change did your defoliation you're popping twisting? What is different? That's once again
[22:31.690 --> 22:36.090]  That's why I recommend taking a lot of notes. Do you have all the nutrient notes from last time?
[22:36.530 --> 22:41.490]  You say you're using the build a soil. Like I said, maybe that needs to be refreshed and recharged
[22:41.490 --> 22:45.330]  Maybe you need to order a few packages that mix in there for the next crop
[22:45.330 --> 22:50.910]  The only other thing I can think of and this has happened to me and other people think I'm crazy when I say this
[22:50.910 --> 22:54.590]  But maybe you have got what we call nose blind
[22:54.590 --> 23:00.330]  Maybe you just can't smell it or taste it anymore because you've been around it so much and you've become immune to it
[23:00.530 --> 23:04.050]  Stinky people don't know they stink. We all enjoy our own brand
[23:04.050 --> 23:08.810]  You may be sleeping in the house where that herb is. You may sleep there. You may wake up there
[23:08.810 --> 23:11.210]  You may eat breakfast there. You may have lunch there
[23:11.210 --> 23:13.630]  You may go about your whole entire day there by now
[23:13.630 --> 23:17.530]  You are totally immune to the smell of that ganja just because you're there so much
[23:17.530 --> 23:18.770]  I know that's extreme
[23:18.770 --> 23:23.890]  but sometimes I just don't even realize that there's ganja in the house and that you can smell it and I'll pull up to the
[23:23.890 --> 23:27.750]  House with the friend like Michael come over and I could be like buddy. You got to get a new carbon filter
[23:27.750 --> 23:30.270]  I can smell it down the block and I'm like, what do you mean bro?
[23:30.750 --> 23:35.990]  Anything and then Michael be like let's go somewhere and we'll go run around in the car for a little bit and not smoke and
[23:35.990 --> 23:37.750]  We'll come back and I'll be like, ah
[23:37.750 --> 23:40.270]  Bro, I need a new carbon filter and he's like, yeah, bro
[23:40.270 --> 23:45.470]  You just got to get out because you didn't smell it at all. So maybe maybe hopefully that's the situation you're having
[23:45.470 --> 23:49.590]  Maybe all the turps are there. Maybe you're growing like a pro and a champ and you're just so good at growing
[23:49.710 --> 23:54.990]  You don't even smell that crazy dink anymore. You've got to improve and make it even stinkier and dankier
[23:55.990 --> 23:59.690]  There are a few products I guess not products but a few things I can
[24:00.510 --> 24:05.870]  Recommend that may help improve that stankiness. Maybe a couple of these maybe a couple of these and combo
[24:05.870 --> 24:07.430]  Maybe one or two by themselves
[24:07.430 --> 24:09.710]  I've always noticed that kelp based
[24:09.950 --> 24:16.710]  products make my plants that if it's got a skunky or an earthy or a cushy or a coffee kind of aroma that
[24:16.990 --> 24:19.950]  Kelp product. Well, I'm not sure what kelp product you're going to buy
[24:19.950 --> 24:24.390]  There are a lot of them but see kelp in a product will definitely bring out that funky
[24:24.950 --> 24:26.790]  earthy cushy
[24:26.790 --> 24:31.790]  Gassy those aromas are enhanced by kelp in my opinion in my experience in my grow
[24:32.070 --> 24:37.150]  Also, I may recommend adding more sugars and more microbes that will help with everything. That's always a good idea
[24:38.030 --> 24:40.710]  carbs microbes you that that will always help then
[24:41.310 --> 24:49.070]  Something I've noticed that makes plants funky and stinky all the time is fish products any ocean products seabird guano or fish products
[24:49.510 --> 24:54.270]  Fish emulsion fish meal anything with fish in it will make your plant it
[24:54.270 --> 24:59.430]  I think if you put it into the nutrient mix into the soil and it's got a little bit of the proper stank to it
[24:59.430 --> 25:03.710]  That stank does transfer into the plants stank makes stank. So that's what I think
[25:03.710 --> 25:07.150]  So maybe add some kelp add some fish products definitely
[25:07.550 --> 25:13.990]  Increase the amount of microbe activity in there and that may help with your lack of aroma and flavor
[25:14.470 --> 25:16.430]  Bro, my friend shoe trader 101
[25:16.430 --> 25:20.990]  I hope I helped you out if you've got any shoes to trade definitely do hit me up you all guys all know that
