[00:14.910 --> 00:17.510]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:17.510 --> 00:19.350]  It's time for episode number 215
[00:19.350 --> 00:21.030]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:21.030 --> 00:24.710]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:24.710 --> 00:25.870]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:25.870 --> 00:27.230]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:27.230 --> 00:29.710]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:29.710 --> 00:31.630]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone
[00:31.630 --> 00:34.210]  who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:34.210 --> 00:37.050]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:37.050 --> 00:38.990]  I'm your host, my friends call me Roster Jeff.
[00:38.990 --> 00:40.830]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:40.830 --> 00:43.110]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:43.110 --> 00:44.710]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:44.710 --> 00:47.150]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:47.150 --> 00:48.910]  Big shout out to Kat, Koot,
[00:48.910 --> 00:51.190]  and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:53.630 --> 00:55.630]  I hope everybody's having a good week.
[00:55.630 --> 00:56.510]  Hope you had a good weekend.
[00:56.510 --> 00:57.670]  I hope you're listening to this on Monday
[00:57.670 --> 00:59.150]  when it comes out fresh.
[00:59.150 --> 01:00.270]  No matter what day of the week it is,
[01:00.270 --> 01:01.750]  what time it is, wherever you are,
[01:01.750 --> 01:02.590]  hope you're having a good time.
[01:02.590 --> 01:04.030]  Hope you're smoking a fat joint,
[01:04.030 --> 01:05.430]  maybe taking a dab with me.
[01:06.310 --> 01:07.510]  I've been smoking on the,
[01:07.510 --> 01:09.390]  I've got some Three Rivers Distillate.
[01:09.390 --> 01:12.750]  I've got some Three Rivers Organics Dubwise Distillate.
[01:12.750 --> 01:13.750]  It was grown by me.
[01:13.790 --> 01:17.550]  It was actually extracted by the folks at Pure Distilled.
[01:17.550 --> 01:20.950]  I'm really enjoying the Three Rivers Dubwise Distillate.
[01:20.950 --> 01:21.830]  It's pretty nice.
[01:21.830 --> 01:25.630]  I've been talking a lot about the HCFSE and the HTFSE,
[01:25.630 --> 01:27.870]  the high cannabinoid full spectrum extract,
[01:27.870 --> 01:30.750]  and the high terpene full spectrum extract,
[01:30.750 --> 01:32.150]  and all those extracts.
[01:32.150 --> 01:34.190]  I'm not sure if I prefer the distillate
[01:34.190 --> 01:36.230]  or the HCFSE to tell you the truth.
[01:37.270 --> 01:40.350]  To treat my, most of you folks that listen to the podcast
[01:40.350 --> 01:42.630]  know I've got a little traumatic brain injury,
[01:42.670 --> 01:44.030]  and sometimes it fucks with me.
[01:44.030 --> 01:45.930]  And I think smoking a fat dab of distillate
[01:45.930 --> 01:48.690]  is the quickest way to make my head noise go away.
[01:48.690 --> 01:51.350]  But sometimes I really enjoy the effects
[01:51.350 --> 01:54.470]  of the high cannabinoid full spectrum extract crystals
[01:54.470 --> 01:55.470]  and a nice chunky dab.
[01:55.470 --> 01:56.990]  I'm not sure which I prefer.
[01:56.990 --> 01:58.390]  So they're in competition.
[01:58.390 --> 01:59.870]  They're both trying to win my heart.
[01:59.870 --> 02:01.530]  We will see which one wins.
[02:02.510 --> 02:03.510]  Where do we start?
[02:03.510 --> 02:05.230]  Let's talk about this thermal banger.
[02:05.230 --> 02:06.430]  I've had an eventful week.
[02:06.430 --> 02:09.270]  I hope you guys have had as good of a week as I have.
[02:09.270 --> 02:12.510]  On Wednesday, I had an adventurous day.
[02:12.510 --> 02:16.190]  I started off by heading to Elevate, Elevate Glass,
[02:16.190 --> 02:17.750]  517 South Tejon.
[02:17.750 --> 02:19.190]  I picked up in Colorado Springs,
[02:19.190 --> 02:21.550]  I picked up a brand new thermal banger.
[02:21.550 --> 02:23.830]  Let me explain this thermal banger a little bit.
[02:23.830 --> 02:25.070]  Let me explain a normal banger,
[02:25.070 --> 02:27.670]  and then we will kind of describe the thermal banger.
[02:27.670 --> 02:31.910]  So a normal banger, a banger fits on a hash pipe,
[02:31.910 --> 02:33.470]  a bubbler, a small bong.
[02:33.470 --> 02:35.470]  I prefer a very small dab rig.
[02:35.470 --> 02:38.670]  So this is the part that you actually will put the dab into.
[02:38.670 --> 02:40.390]  This part fits on your hash pipe,
[02:40.390 --> 02:44.110]  your bubbler, your small bong, your little dab rig,
[02:44.110 --> 02:46.310]  a Hitman sidecar, or a little Mad Rob,
[02:46.310 --> 02:47.670]  or a little Toro piece.
[02:47.670 --> 02:48.670]  This piece fits on there.
[02:48.670 --> 02:50.390]  This is the part you heat up.
[02:50.390 --> 02:51.910]  You put the dab into here.
[02:51.910 --> 02:55.090]  It kind of looks like it could be just a normal bowl.
[02:55.990 --> 02:57.190]  That's got a stem that comes up,
[02:57.190 --> 02:58.590]  and then it's got a 90 degree angle.
[02:58.590 --> 03:01.750]  And then there is a quartz, just a dish.
[03:01.750 --> 03:03.790]  It just looks like, just you heat that up,
[03:03.790 --> 03:04.750]  and then you put your dab in there,
[03:04.750 --> 03:07.470]  and then you put a carb cap on it, and you take a dab.
[03:07.470 --> 03:09.590]  It's just a normal dish.
[03:09.590 --> 03:12.090]  It just looks like you took a dish, like maybe a thimble,
[03:12.090 --> 03:14.990]  and then attached it to a way to put it onto the bong,
[03:14.990 --> 03:15.950]  or onto your rig.
[03:15.950 --> 03:18.190]  So, and the idea is you heat that up,
[03:18.190 --> 03:19.310]  and then you let it cool a little bit,
[03:19.310 --> 03:20.150]  and you put the dab in there,
[03:20.150 --> 03:21.430]  and you cover it with a carb cap,
[03:21.430 --> 03:23.070]  and the carb cap stokes the heat,
[03:23.070 --> 03:24.870]  and then you get a nice healthy dab.
[03:24.870 --> 03:27.310]  With the thermal banger, this is a little bit different.
[03:27.310 --> 03:31.230]  It's like they took the original idea of the banger,
[03:31.230 --> 03:34.310]  and then on the inside, they put another piece of glass,
[03:34.310 --> 03:36.910]  which is where the dab will actually go.
[03:36.910 --> 03:39.110]  So, it's hard to explain.
[03:39.110 --> 03:42.430]  It's like a thimble with another thimble inside of it,
[03:42.430 --> 03:44.150]  basically, and they're both made out of glass.
[03:44.150 --> 03:45.110]  It's all made out of glass.
[03:45.110 --> 03:46.110]  It's supposed to be quartz.
[03:46.110 --> 03:47.230]  These are glass.
[03:47.230 --> 03:50.550]  So, you heat the outside of this thermal banger,
[03:50.550 --> 03:53.150]  and the outer layer of glass gets really hot.
[03:53.150 --> 03:55.630]  The glass on the inside does not get hot.
[03:55.630 --> 03:58.670]  You drop your dab into the glass on the inside,
[03:58.670 --> 03:59.990]  and you cap it.
[03:59.990 --> 04:02.590]  Now, this does a few things.
[04:02.590 --> 04:04.910]  First of all, the dab you just dropped on there
[04:04.910 --> 04:07.470]  doesn't come in contact with the heated surface,
[04:07.470 --> 04:09.990]  so it doesn't cool the nail down super quickly.
[04:09.990 --> 04:11.630]  When you're taking large dabs,
[04:11.630 --> 04:14.870]  sometimes the hash will cool the nail,
[04:14.870 --> 04:17.390]  and it will steal your heat, so you don't get all the dab.
[04:17.390 --> 04:18.730]  So, that can't happen with this,
[04:18.730 --> 04:21.110]  because you're not actually putting the dab
[04:21.110 --> 04:22.470]  on the heated surface.
[04:23.390 --> 04:26.430]  Also, it gives it low temp.
[04:26.430 --> 04:28.390]  We say low temps for taste.
[04:28.390 --> 04:30.710]  You gotta taste, waste it to taste it.
[04:30.710 --> 04:32.470]  Lower temps for better turps.
[04:32.470 --> 04:35.290]  I have realized that is not how I wanna dab.
[04:35.290 --> 04:36.390]  I like hot dabs.
[04:36.390 --> 04:38.270]  I like my shit a little bit too hot.
[04:38.270 --> 04:40.150]  I am in the glow squad.
[04:40.150 --> 04:41.110]  I wanna burn myself.
[04:41.110 --> 04:42.270]  I don't like wasting hash.
[04:42.270 --> 04:44.710]  I like going at it too hot and making sure I get it all.
[04:44.710 --> 04:46.650]  I do not feel like the thermal banger
[04:46.650 --> 04:48.790]  is something that I am going to enjoy.
[04:48.790 --> 04:50.070]  I'm gonna keep giving it a few tries.
[04:50.070 --> 04:50.910]  I might test it.
[04:51.790 --> 04:53.930]  I liked watching the HCFSE burn in it.
[04:53.930 --> 04:55.390]  It seemed to melt a little bit differently.
[04:55.390 --> 04:58.270]  It puddled differently, but it is not my style.
[04:58.270 --> 05:02.110]  You guys, the thermal banger is not Rasta Jeff approved.
[05:03.110 --> 05:04.590]  I may have to get a different carb cap.
[05:04.590 --> 05:06.590]  I may have Barefoot come over
[05:06.590 --> 05:08.590]  and show me how to use it a little differently.
[05:08.590 --> 05:10.110]  But so far from what I've played with
[05:10.110 --> 05:12.070]  and what I've seen my friends do with it,
[05:12.070 --> 05:13.070]  that is not my style.
[05:13.070 --> 05:14.510]  It's for low temp dabbing.
[05:14.510 --> 05:17.790]  I like these hot, hot and hurty, lung burning dabs.
[05:17.790 --> 05:19.870]  So I don't know that the thermal banger is for me.
[05:19.870 --> 05:21.350]  I'm not trying to bash a product.
[05:21.350 --> 05:22.990]  Actually, I want you to go buy one and try it.
[05:22.990 --> 05:23.830]  See what you think.
[05:23.830 --> 05:25.030]  Let me know what you think about the thermal banger.
[05:25.030 --> 05:27.750]  I got mine at Elevate Glass at 517 South Nahon
[05:27.750 --> 05:30.190]  in beautiful downtown Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[05:31.250 --> 05:32.150]  Go there, get one.
[05:32.870 --> 05:33.710]  See what you think about it.
[05:33.710 --> 05:35.190]  Shout out to my friends at Elevate.
[05:35.190 --> 05:37.550]  So I was talking about my amazing day on Wednesday.
[05:37.550 --> 05:39.790]  Let's talk a little bit more about that.
[05:39.790 --> 05:42.310]  Other than getting the thermal banger,
[05:42.310 --> 05:43.750]  we headed up to Denver
[05:43.750 --> 05:46.870]  and I started my evening with a Metallica concert.
[05:46.870 --> 05:47.950]  It's right, we headed up to Denver
[05:47.950 --> 05:50.230]  and there were two opening acts.
[05:50.230 --> 05:52.230]  I think the first band was called Volbeat.
[05:52.230 --> 05:55.350]  And then after that, it was Avenged Sevenfold.
[05:55.350 --> 05:57.670]  No offense to anybody that's into either those bands
[05:57.670 --> 06:00.470]  or those bands, I purposefully missed them.
[06:00.470 --> 06:02.030]  I was not into those bands at all.
[06:02.870 --> 06:03.710]  I went to see Metallica.
[06:03.710 --> 06:07.010]  I'm not really into the hard rock metal thing, honestly,
[06:07.010 --> 06:08.330]  but I grew up on Metallica.
[06:08.330 --> 06:10.850]  Metallica was my first favorite band.
[06:10.850 --> 06:12.390]  I think there may have been bands before that
[06:12.390 --> 06:14.450]  when I was a little kid and didn't know any better.
[06:14.450 --> 06:18.830]  But I think when I was becoming a rebellious teenager,
[06:18.830 --> 06:21.350]  I think Metallica is what helped me do that.
[06:21.350 --> 06:23.750]  I used to wear a Metallica shirt every day.
[06:23.750 --> 06:26.150]  My closet was just filled with black Metallica shirts.
[06:26.150 --> 06:26.990]  I had all of them.
[06:26.990 --> 06:30.750]  If they put out a Metallica shirt in that era, I had it.
[06:30.870 --> 06:32.750]  I've been a Metallica fan for a long time.
[06:32.750 --> 06:33.590]  I'm a drummer.
[06:33.590 --> 06:34.430]  I've played drums.
[06:34.430 --> 06:37.870]  I think I got drums for my 14th or 15th birthday.
[06:37.870 --> 06:39.830]  And the drummer from Metallica
[06:39.830 --> 06:41.670]  was the dude that inspired me.
[06:41.670 --> 06:44.390]  So I was about probably 13 or 14 years old
[06:44.390 --> 06:46.770]  and my uncles, they're bad influences on me,
[06:46.770 --> 06:48.430]  but they're really cool dudes.
[06:48.430 --> 06:50.910]  They decided to take me to a concert in California.
[06:50.910 --> 06:52.830]  I'd never been to a big stadium concert.
[06:52.830 --> 06:54.790]  I'd been to like little shitty gigs and stuff,
[06:54.790 --> 06:56.190]  but I'd never been to a real concert.
[06:56.190 --> 07:00.350]  So my uncles, Ron and Eric, shout out dudes,
[07:00.350 --> 07:02.430]  they took me to see some shitty bands.
[07:02.430 --> 07:04.830]  They took me to see Jackal and the Damn Yankees.
[07:05.910 --> 07:07.350]  It's not the coolest bands on the planet,
[07:07.350 --> 07:10.150]  but when you're a 14 year old kid or a 13 year old kid,
[07:10.150 --> 07:13.070]  fucking drums and guitars and loud and lots of people
[07:13.070 --> 07:15.230]  and weird looking freaks and boobs everywhere,
[07:15.230 --> 07:17.030]  it was a great time.
[07:17.030 --> 07:19.550]  So how does Metallica tie into that?
[07:19.550 --> 07:23.030]  My uncles, my uncle Eric had a Chevy El Camino.
[07:23.030 --> 07:27.150]  It's like a super fucking white trash rockstar ride.
[07:27.150 --> 07:27.990]  That's like a truck.
[07:27.990 --> 07:30.550]  It's kind of lowered, but it had a camper shell on it.
[07:30.550 --> 07:32.950]  So my uncles were in the front and I was in the back part
[07:32.950 --> 07:34.270]  where the camper shell is,
[07:34.270 --> 07:36.510]  and there was no window between us and them
[07:36.510 --> 07:38.150]  or between myself and them.
[07:38.150 --> 07:41.150]  And they smoked a joint and put on the Black Album.
[07:41.150 --> 07:42.670]  I'd been smoking a little bit of weed
[07:42.670 --> 07:44.790]  with a friend of mine, but not regularly.
[07:44.790 --> 07:46.710]  I hadn't become a pothead yet.
[07:47.590 --> 07:49.510]  They put on the Black Album.
[07:49.510 --> 07:51.870]  It starts with Inner Sandman and then it's Sad But True.
[07:51.870 --> 07:53.390]  And then I think it's Through The Never Maybe
[07:53.390 --> 07:54.630]  or Holier Than Thou.
[07:54.630 --> 07:57.590]  But Inner Sandman and Sad But True are all you fucking need.
[07:58.230 --> 07:59.070]  It starts the whole album off.
[07:59.070 --> 08:00.990]  It starts the whole day off perfectly.
[08:00.990 --> 08:01.990]  They smoked a joint.
[08:01.990 --> 08:04.030]  I'm pretty sure I got a little stoned from the joint
[08:04.030 --> 08:05.430]  that they smoked in the front of the car
[08:05.430 --> 08:06.710]  because they just hot boxed that bitch.
[08:06.710 --> 08:08.990]  They rolled up the windows and smoked on the highway.
[08:08.990 --> 08:11.470]  So all the smoke came to the back of the car where I was.
[08:11.470 --> 08:13.310]  I got good and stoned.
[08:13.310 --> 08:16.710]  That day I decided I was going to be a drummer.
[08:16.710 --> 08:18.870]  I knew that I had to play the drums.
[08:18.870 --> 08:22.670]  And that joint that my uncle smoked and Metallica
[08:22.670 --> 08:25.390]  and that adventure that day changed me
[08:25.390 --> 08:26.950]  and that told me that day,
[08:26.990 --> 08:27.990]  hey, you're going to be a drummer.
[08:27.990 --> 08:29.350]  This is part of your fucking life.
[08:29.350 --> 08:30.630]  This is what you're going to do.
[08:30.630 --> 08:32.990]  So I've been a huge Metallica fan since then.
[08:32.990 --> 08:35.870]  I was already a Metallica fan, but that's what sold me.
[08:35.870 --> 08:38.310]  Getting stoned with my older uncles on accident.
[08:38.310 --> 08:39.550]  I don't even think they realized
[08:39.550 --> 08:40.670]  they were getting me high in the car.
[08:40.670 --> 08:42.110]  They were just doing their own thing.
[08:42.110 --> 08:45.230]  But I got stoned with them, saw a great concert,
[08:45.230 --> 08:46.390]  and then they just changed my life.
[08:46.390 --> 08:48.150]  I'm sure that the next day I was obnoxious,
[08:48.150 --> 08:50.550]  air drumming on everything, drumming on the desk at school.
[08:50.550 --> 08:52.510]  I actually got kicked out of several classes in school.
[08:52.510 --> 08:55.670]  It continued all the way through my high school career.
[08:55.670 --> 08:57.950]  Got kicked out of all my classes for drumming on the desk.
[08:57.950 --> 08:59.590]  And eventually my last year of high school,
[08:59.590 --> 09:01.790]  I only had band classes.
[09:01.790 --> 09:03.470]  That's not a joke.
[09:03.470 --> 09:05.430]  All right, so I drove up and saw Metallica.
[09:05.430 --> 09:07.230]  Metallica was fucking awesome, you guys.
[09:07.230 --> 09:09.430]  Sports Authority Field is huge.
[09:09.430 --> 09:11.110]  Fuck trying to park at that place.
[09:11.110 --> 09:13.990]  It took me, no joke, 30, maybe 45,
[09:13.990 --> 09:15.790]  maybe an hour to find a parking place.
[09:15.790 --> 09:19.230]  Eventually I ended up paying $25 for a parking space.
[09:19.230 --> 09:21.430]  Ended up paying 20 more dollars for a pedal cab
[09:21.430 --> 09:23.750]  to get me from that parking space to the venue.
[09:24.590 --> 09:25.950]  It was worth the ride.
[09:25.950 --> 09:28.270]  It was worth paying the little dude to pedal me around.
[09:28.270 --> 09:29.110]  He was pretty cool.
[09:29.110 --> 09:30.190]  He knew a lot of stuff about Denver,
[09:30.190 --> 09:31.030]  knew about the area.
[09:31.030 --> 09:32.590]  That was helpful.
[09:32.590 --> 09:34.030]  So, man, fuck parking.
[09:34.030 --> 09:35.430]  But once we got there, it was cool.
[09:35.430 --> 09:36.750]  Once we got into the venue, it was cool.
[09:36.750 --> 09:38.550]  I timed it beautifully.
[09:38.550 --> 09:39.590]  We got some food on the way.
[09:39.590 --> 09:40.630]  We stopped at Elevate.
[09:40.630 --> 09:41.710]  Of course, we hit some traffic.
[09:41.710 --> 09:42.670]  There was a little bit of rain.
[09:42.670 --> 09:44.550]  We had to drive around and find parking.
[09:44.550 --> 09:46.910]  Once we got into the venue, we had time to find,
[09:46.910 --> 09:47.750]  we got some snacks.
[09:47.750 --> 09:48.570]  We got a slice of pizza.
[09:48.570 --> 09:49.750]  We got some drinks.
[09:49.750 --> 09:50.750]  Just Cokes, you guys.
[09:50.750 --> 09:51.590]  No beer or nothing.
[09:51.590 --> 09:52.430]  I don't go crazy.
[09:52.430 --> 09:53.250]  I don't drink at all.
[09:54.190 --> 09:57.550]  And so we found our seats and we looked around
[09:57.550 --> 09:58.390]  and I talked to the guy next to me.
[09:58.390 --> 09:59.310]  I was like, what's up, bro?
[09:59.310 --> 10:00.350]  And he goes, it's going, man.
[10:00.350 --> 10:02.350]  And apparently the guy in front of me was super drunk
[10:02.350 --> 10:04.710]  and being an asshole and trying to talk to everybody.
[10:04.710 --> 10:05.770]  He did not want to talk to me.
[10:05.770 --> 10:07.110]  So that was cool.
[10:07.110 --> 10:08.870]  Metallica came out shortly after that
[10:08.870 --> 10:11.590]  and did quite a few cool songs.
[10:11.590 --> 10:12.990]  They did mostly new stuff.
[10:12.990 --> 10:16.190]  They did the Atlas Rise and they did,
[10:16.190 --> 10:17.670]  there's another one that I can't,
[10:17.670 --> 10:19.490]  fucking Hardwired to Self-Destruct.
[10:19.490 --> 10:21.030]  They did those.
[10:21.030 --> 10:22.970]  I'm not a huge fan of the new stuff.
[10:22.970 --> 10:23.810]  It's really cool.
[10:23.810 --> 10:25.210]  I just, like everybody says,
[10:25.210 --> 10:26.710]  everyone that's a fan of music,
[10:26.710 --> 10:28.390]  they all like the old stuff better.
[10:28.390 --> 10:30.250]  Everybody just says, I want to hear the old stuff.
[10:30.250 --> 10:31.810]  And that's kind of how I felt about it.
[10:31.810 --> 10:33.530]  I'm looking at my phone because I made a note,
[10:33.530 --> 10:35.930]  a really, a list of songs that they played,
[10:35.930 --> 10:37.490]  but I cannot find it here.
[10:37.490 --> 10:38.770]  I know I have it on my phone.
[10:38.770 --> 10:41.010]  Anyway, they were jamming.
[10:41.010 --> 10:42.010]  They were rocking out.
[10:42.010 --> 10:43.330]  They did For Whom the Bell Tolls
[10:43.330 --> 10:44.210]  and they did another song.
[10:44.210 --> 10:47.890]  And then after that, the band looked kind of confused.
[10:47.890 --> 10:50.250]  They were like, I'm not sure what's happening here.
[10:50.250 --> 10:52.090]  And then they all walked off the stage
[10:52.090 --> 10:55.730]  and a dude came on the microphone over the PA system.
[10:55.730 --> 10:59.210]  And he said, hey guys, we are not canceling the show,
[10:59.210 --> 11:01.810]  but there's a major lightning storm over Denver right now.
[11:01.810 --> 11:02.630]  And you could see it.
[11:02.630 --> 11:04.290]  People had been watching it.
[11:04.290 --> 11:05.770]  They're like, there's a major lightning storm.
[11:05.770 --> 11:08.250]  We need everybody to exit the grandstand,
[11:08.250 --> 11:11.530]  which this is the football stadium in Denver.
[11:11.530 --> 11:13.210]  We need everyone to exit the grandstand
[11:13.210 --> 11:16.170]  and please make your way safely to the concourse.
[11:16.170 --> 11:17.530]  So we all had to get up out of our seats
[11:17.530 --> 11:20.850]  and go find a shelter basically from the rain
[11:20.930 --> 11:24.370]  and from the lightning in the concourse
[11:24.370 --> 11:25.950]  at Sports Authority Field.
[11:25.950 --> 11:26.790]  It was crowded.
[11:26.790 --> 11:27.650]  It was obnoxious.
[11:27.650 --> 11:28.490]  People were smoking
[11:28.490 --> 11:31.130]  and blowing fucking cigarette smoke in my face.
[11:31.130 --> 11:32.490]  People were drunk and ridiculous,
[11:32.490 --> 11:36.950]  but I knew that if I waited, there was more Metallica.
[11:36.950 --> 11:38.250]  So I'm scrolling through my phone solely here
[11:38.250 --> 11:40.130]  because I made a couple of notes on songs that they played
[11:40.130 --> 11:43.470]  and can't find the note, which is weird.
[11:45.050 --> 11:48.530]  But anyway, Metallica did come back on.
[11:48.530 --> 11:49.730]  We made it back to our seats.
[11:49.730 --> 11:51.850]  Metallica came back on.
[11:51.850 --> 11:55.490]  They played, I think they played Motor Breath at that point
[11:55.490 --> 11:56.890]  and then they talked for a couple of seconds.
[11:56.890 --> 11:59.090]  James Hetfield actually gave a little bit of a speech.
[11:59.090 --> 12:01.890]  He's like, hey, I forgot exactly how he said it,
[12:01.890 --> 12:04.690]  but he talked about, I don't care if you voted for this guy,
[12:04.690 --> 12:06.010]  I don't care if you voted for that guy,
[12:06.010 --> 12:07.010]  I don't care if you drink this,
[12:07.010 --> 12:08.050]  I don't care if you smoke that,
[12:08.050 --> 12:09.370]  I don't care if you believe in a God,
[12:09.370 --> 12:11.570]  I don't care if you don't believe in a God.
[12:11.570 --> 12:13.630]  He's basically said, we're here to fucking party
[12:13.630 --> 12:15.910]  and listen to Metallica, so we're all fucking friends.
[12:15.910 --> 12:18.690]  Fuck all that bullshit, which I thought was kind of cool.
[12:18.690 --> 12:20.850]  Then they played, then James asked,
[12:20.850 --> 12:22.290]  do you guys want some hard stuff?
[12:22.290 --> 12:23.970]  And of course the crowd was like, yeah.
[12:23.970 --> 12:26.130]  And James Hetfield from Metallica is kind of funny.
[12:26.130 --> 12:27.490]  He tries to be a comedian on stage.
[12:27.490 --> 12:29.170]  He's a pretty good front dude.
[12:29.170 --> 12:30.690]  Then he's like, you guys wanna hear some hard stuff?
[12:30.690 --> 12:32.650]  And of course the crowd was like, fuck yeah.
[12:32.650 --> 12:34.370]  So that's when I really feel like
[12:34.370 --> 12:36.010]  Metallica started firing it up.
[12:36.010 --> 12:39.610]  They did Sad But True, then they did One,
[12:39.610 --> 12:43.490]  followed by Master of Puppets, followed by Creeping Death.
[12:43.490 --> 12:48.370]  Then they brought out another drum set
[12:49.050 --> 12:50.650]  and set it at the very front edge of the stage.
[12:50.650 --> 12:52.890]  You guys, this was at Sports Authority Field.
[12:52.890 --> 12:54.050]  I was a mile away.
[12:54.050 --> 12:56.010]  It was a mile high, plus I was a mile away
[12:56.010 --> 12:57.170]  from the fucking stage.
[12:57.170 --> 12:59.850]  Everybody looked like they were about a quarter inch tall
[12:59.850 --> 13:00.690]  from where I could see them.
[13:00.690 --> 13:02.910]  The drum set was just a blur.
[13:02.910 --> 13:04.610]  The backdrop was amazing.
[13:04.610 --> 13:06.330]  The backdrop was so cool.
[13:06.330 --> 13:08.250]  They had 50 foot tall video screens
[13:08.250 --> 13:09.610]  that they would play videos on.
[13:09.610 --> 13:11.890]  The pyrotechnics were pretty cool.
[13:11.890 --> 13:13.170]  It was pretty bitching.
[13:14.010 --> 13:15.750]  So then they did Seek and Destroy
[13:15.750 --> 13:16.930]  on the front of the stage like that.
[13:16.930 --> 13:19.250]  Then they did Fight Fire with Fire.
[13:19.250 --> 13:20.250]  Then there were a couple more songs
[13:20.250 --> 13:22.370]  that I did not make note of.
[13:22.370 --> 13:24.050]  They shredded for a little while longer.
[13:24.050 --> 13:25.530]  I remember hearing Creeping Death in there.
[13:25.530 --> 13:27.370]  Fade to Black was in there.
[13:27.370 --> 13:30.890]  Then they encored, of course, with fucking Inner Sandman.
[13:30.890 --> 13:32.250]  Everybody sang Inner Sandman.
[13:32.250 --> 13:34.650]  It was a great show, lots of great pyrotechnics.
[13:35.650 --> 13:36.930]  Like I said, I was a mile away.
[13:36.930 --> 13:40.850]  I was in the back section of the Sports Authority Field.
[13:40.850 --> 13:43.050]  And when some of the pyrotechnics would go off,
[13:43.050 --> 13:44.310]  I could feel the heat.
[13:44.310 --> 13:45.770]  I could tell that my date was cold
[13:45.770 --> 13:47.570]  because it was getting chilly and it was raining.
[13:47.570 --> 13:49.770]  I could tell that she would feel relieved
[13:49.770 --> 13:51.490]  when some of the pyrotechnics would go off.
[13:51.490 --> 13:52.770]  She'd be like, oh, warmth.
[13:52.770 --> 13:55.130]  And she would reach to it like a little heater.
[13:55.130 --> 13:56.850]  So Metallica was fucking awesome.
[13:56.850 --> 13:58.970]  Metallica shredded all night.
[13:58.970 --> 14:00.170]  The show ended.
[14:00.170 --> 14:01.890]  It took us a little bit to get out of there
[14:01.890 --> 14:05.490]  because humans are fucking cattle and they're half retarded.
[14:05.490 --> 14:09.130]  But once we got out of there, we made it to the car.
[14:09.130 --> 14:13.310]  And then we headed to Cervantes' other side
[14:13.310 --> 14:14.730]  at Five Points in Denver
[14:14.730 --> 14:16.690]  because one of my favorite reggae artists,
[14:16.690 --> 14:20.050]  Capleton, was playing at Cervantes' other side.
[14:20.050 --> 14:22.490]  When we walked in, he was already playing.
[14:22.490 --> 14:24.650]  I feel like he'd only been going for a few songs
[14:24.650 --> 14:28.310]  because he went for a good 45 minutes to an hour or so
[14:28.310 --> 14:30.330]  after we got there.
[14:30.330 --> 14:33.030]  Man, Capleton is a reggae artist
[14:33.030 --> 14:35.530]  who is known for playing really high energy sets
[14:35.530 --> 14:39.670]  at Reggae Sunsplash and Rototom reggae music festivals.
[14:39.670 --> 14:40.530]  Check him out, you guys.
[14:40.530 --> 14:41.770]  If you were into reggae music,
[14:41.770 --> 14:44.530]  if you were into high energy music, check out Capleton.
[14:45.290 --> 14:46.090]  Capleton put on a great show.
[14:46.090 --> 14:49.070]  Shout out to everybody at Cervantes' other side.
[14:50.290 --> 14:51.610]  Man, I had a good time there.
[14:51.610 --> 14:53.410]  There's not a lot to talk about about the Capleton show.
[14:53.410 --> 14:55.330]  The Metallica show was huge.
[14:55.330 --> 14:57.770]  So many people, so much pyrotechnics.
[14:57.770 --> 15:00.730]  The Capleton show was a small club show.
[15:00.730 --> 15:03.210]  It was a small, I'm gonna say maybe three,
[15:03.210 --> 15:04.850]  maybe 500 people there.
[15:04.850 --> 15:07.810]  There couldn't have been 500 people in that club.
[15:07.810 --> 15:10.490]  But every single person was paying attention
[15:10.490 --> 15:13.770]  to every single moment of that Capleton concert.
[15:13.770 --> 15:16.950]  He speaks, the way he speaks, you just have to listen.
[15:16.950 --> 15:19.170]  You cannot turn your head when Capleton speaks.
[15:19.170 --> 15:20.430]  He really gets your attention.
[15:20.430 --> 15:22.970]  So I had a huge weekend seeing some music.
[15:22.970 --> 15:26.210]  Tomorrow night, actually, I will be seeing Dead & Co
[15:26.210 --> 15:28.530]  at Folsom Field in Boulder, Colorado.
[15:28.530 --> 15:30.530]  So I look forward to that.
[15:30.530 --> 15:34.010]  And then I've got a whole bunch more cool stuff coming up.
[15:34.010 --> 15:35.930]  Fish, I'm super excited to see fish.
[15:35.930 --> 15:39.650]  I'm gonna do all three nights of fish at Dick's Sporting Goods.
[15:39.650 --> 15:41.570]  Then I've got some comedy shows coming up.
[15:41.570 --> 15:43.330]  It's gonna be a great summer.
[15:43.890 --> 15:44.770]  Hey, let me know if you're going to any shows.
[15:44.770 --> 15:46.130]  If you're gonna go see some reggae music,
[15:46.130 --> 15:47.850]  if you're gonna go see whatever kind of music
[15:47.850 --> 15:49.890]  you're gonna go see, whatever you're doing for summer fun,
[15:49.890 --> 15:50.730]  let me know what you're gonna do.
[15:50.730 --> 15:51.550]  I wanna hear about it,
[15:51.550 --> 15:53.170]  because I just got to brag for like a good 15 minutes
[15:53.170 --> 15:55.010]  about all the cool shit that I do.
[15:55.010 --> 15:55.850]  Send me an email.
[15:55.850 --> 15:57.310]  Let me know what you're doing this summer.
[15:57.310 --> 15:59.270]  Let me know how you are involving cannabis
[15:59.270 --> 16:01.490]  in your summer fun plans.
[16:01.490 --> 16:02.330]  I would love to hear from you.
[16:02.330 --> 16:04.250]  Send me an email, growfromyourheartathotmail.com,
[16:04.250 --> 16:06.810]  or you can tweet me at GFYH podcast.
[16:06.810 --> 16:08.050]  Let me know what you're doing.
[16:08.050 --> 16:10.150]  So let's move this podcast forward just a little bit.
[16:10.150 --> 16:13.250]  You guys, there are over 50 YouTube videos posted.
[16:14.070 --> 16:16.290]  I think I've got video number 52 or 53 is up now.
[16:16.290 --> 16:19.690]  By the time you listen to this, 53 should be posted.
[16:19.690 --> 16:21.970]  I wanna thank everybody who has been subscribing.
[16:21.970 --> 16:23.770]  I've been getting a lot of video views
[16:23.770 --> 16:25.850]  and a lot of subscribers already.
[16:25.850 --> 16:27.610]  I've only got 50 something videos.
[16:27.610 --> 16:29.950]  I've got another 160 to put up.
[16:29.950 --> 16:32.130]  So I appreciate everyone who has subscribed.
[16:32.130 --> 16:32.970]  Thank you guys.
[16:32.970 --> 16:34.210]  I appreciate it.
[16:34.210 --> 16:37.450]  If you wanna check out the videos of the first 50 episodes,
[16:37.450 --> 16:38.730]  go to YouTube and just search
[16:38.730 --> 16:40.450]  for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[16:40.450 --> 16:41.790]  Click subscribe on there.
[16:41.790 --> 16:44.730]  Honestly, you guys, the first 50 videos are a mess.
[16:44.730 --> 16:46.230]  There's not a lot of effort put into them
[16:46.230 --> 16:47.830]  because I'm just trying to get them out there
[16:47.830 --> 16:48.910]  and get caught up.
[16:48.910 --> 16:50.810]  Once I get caught up, the videos will get better.
[16:50.810 --> 16:52.090]  I know what I'm doing now.
[16:52.090 --> 16:53.270]  I've played with iMovie enough
[16:53.270 --> 16:55.150]  to kind of have a little clue on it.
[16:55.150 --> 16:57.230]  So I just need to take some time,
[16:57.230 --> 16:58.350]  make some effort and get caught up.
[16:58.350 --> 17:00.930]  It takes, however long the podcast is,
[17:00.930 --> 17:03.450]  it takes about two or three times that amount of time
[17:03.450 --> 17:05.230]  to make the video for it.
[17:05.230 --> 17:07.750]  Plus it takes like another two hours for it to upload.
[17:07.750 --> 17:09.790]  And while it's uploading, I can't make another,
[17:09.790 --> 17:11.790]  I can't work on the computer very much
[17:11.790 --> 17:14.150]  because the way that iMovie works,
[17:15.430 --> 17:17.390]  if you change anything, it fucks everything up.
[17:17.390 --> 17:20.790]  So it kind of ties up my computer for two or three hours.
[17:20.790 --> 17:22.650]  So I try to make the videos at night
[17:22.650 --> 17:24.610]  and then launch one up before I go to bed.
[17:24.610 --> 17:26.230]  And then I'll make another one early in the morning
[17:26.230 --> 17:28.310]  and start launching it to YouTube before I go to work.
[17:28.310 --> 17:30.830]  So that way it's loading while I'm busy.
[17:30.830 --> 17:32.870]  Anyway, the videos are happening.
[17:32.870 --> 17:33.710]  That's the point.
[17:33.710 --> 17:35.070]  And I would appreciate it if you subscribe.
[17:35.070 --> 17:37.830]  That's a way for you to listen to old episodes.
[17:37.830 --> 17:39.470]  So also I wanna know what you think
[17:40.150 --> 17:41.070]  of the Thursday episodes I've been putting out.
[17:41.070 --> 17:43.190]  I've been putting out old episodes,
[17:43.190 --> 17:44.750]  blocks of old episodes on Thursdays.
[17:44.750 --> 17:46.390]  I'm calling it Throwback Thursday.
[17:46.390 --> 17:47.550]  Let me know what you think of that.
[17:47.550 --> 17:48.590]  A few people have emailed me
[17:48.590 --> 17:50.190]  and said that they appreciate it.
[17:50.190 --> 17:52.230]  One person asked me to put the titles
[17:52.230 --> 17:53.350]  of the old episodes in there
[17:53.350 --> 17:55.550]  so they know what they're listening for.
[17:55.550 --> 17:57.250]  I will try to remember to do that,
[17:57.250 --> 17:58.550]  but honestly it's a lot of work.
[17:58.550 --> 18:00.710]  And sometimes I don't even listen to the old episodes.
[18:00.710 --> 18:02.230]  I just have to make the chunks of shows
[18:02.230 --> 18:03.690]  and put them out and get them to you
[18:03.690 --> 18:05.230]  because I am a little bit overwhelmed
[18:05.230 --> 18:06.950]  with all of my commitments and priorities
[18:06.950 --> 18:08.270]  to tell you the damn truth.
[18:09.110 --> 18:10.630]  But I love getting the podcast out to you guys
[18:10.630 --> 18:11.830]  so it's always gonna happen.
[18:11.830 --> 18:16.070]  I haven't missed a single Monday in three years.
[18:16.070 --> 18:18.710]  215 episodes I haven't missed to show you guys.
[18:18.710 --> 18:20.910]  So I'm dedicated, I promise.
[18:20.910 --> 18:22.790]  All right, I wanna keep moving the podcast forward.
[18:22.790 --> 18:25.070]  I am going to talk about cannabis in the show, I promise.
[18:25.070 --> 18:27.390]  I've just got a whole bunch of other shit on my mind.
[18:27.390 --> 18:30.030]  If this episode doesn't keep you entertained,
[18:30.030 --> 18:31.870]  there'll be another podcast coming out Thursday
[18:31.870 --> 18:33.390]  and there'll be another one Monday.
[18:33.390 --> 18:35.630]  So I hope I don't lose you.
[18:35.630 --> 18:37.630]  Let's talk about Patreon right quickly.
[18:37.990 --> 18:39.350]  I know I haven't talked about Ganja at all,
[18:39.350 --> 18:40.190]  but we're going to.
[18:40.190 --> 18:42.550]  Patreon, I owe a few people some thank yous.
[18:42.550 --> 18:44.470]  I'm not sure if people want me to say their real names
[18:44.470 --> 18:46.750]  on the podcast, so I'm just gonna cover everybody
[18:46.750 --> 18:48.790]  in one gigantic thank you.
[18:48.790 --> 18:51.510]  Listen, if you have contributed on Patreon,
[18:51.510 --> 18:52.870]  thank you for your contribution.
[18:52.870 --> 18:53.990]  I truly appreciate it.
[18:53.990 --> 18:55.670]  It does not go unnoticed.
[18:55.670 --> 18:58.390]  Every contribution is appreciated.
[18:58.390 --> 19:01.270]  I see it, I get an alert, and this is my thank you to you.
[19:01.270 --> 19:02.910]  I'm not sure if I'm supposed to say your name
[19:02.910 --> 19:05.230]  because I don't know if you're supposed to be known
[19:05.230 --> 19:07.990]  that you're donating your money to a podcast
[19:07.990 --> 19:10.310]  or if you're even supposed to be known
[19:10.310 --> 19:12.190]  that you're listening to a Ganja podcast
[19:12.190 --> 19:13.350]  or if it's even supposed to be known
[19:13.350 --> 19:15.350]  that you're growing cannabis or supporting cannabis,
[19:15.350 --> 19:16.510]  so I don't say people's names.
[19:16.510 --> 19:18.070]  I'm trying to be better about that,
[19:18.070 --> 19:19.870]  but thank you, I appreciate it.
[19:19.870 --> 19:21.550]  If you don't know what Patreon is,
[19:21.550 --> 19:23.790]  let me explain it really quickly.
[19:23.790 --> 19:26.270]  Patreon is a service that allows you as a listener
[19:26.270 --> 19:28.630]  to financially contribute to the podcast.
[19:28.630 --> 19:30.550]  If you feel like the podcast was worth a couple of bucks
[19:30.550 --> 19:34.030]  of your time, all you have to do is go to patreon.com
[19:34.030 --> 19:36.270]  slash growfromyourheart.
[19:36.270 --> 19:37.430]  You put in a little bit of information,
[19:37.430 --> 19:38.750]  your name, address, phone number, all that,
[19:38.750 --> 19:40.710]  and then it will ask for your credit card number.
[19:40.710 --> 19:42.190]  Once it asks for that, you get to decide
[19:42.190 --> 19:43.830]  how much you want to contribute.
[19:43.830 --> 19:45.630]  You can sign up for a monthly contribution,
[19:45.630 --> 19:46.990]  which is known as a subscription,
[19:46.990 --> 19:49.110]  or you can sign up for a one-time contribution.
[19:49.110 --> 19:50.190]  It's up to you.
[19:50.190 --> 19:51.590]  If you sign up for a monthly,
[19:51.590 --> 19:54.350]  your credit card will be billed on the first of every month
[19:54.350 --> 19:56.710]  for the amount that you decide to contribute.
[19:56.710 --> 19:58.950]  Now, that will be taken from your credit card
[19:58.950 --> 20:00.750]  and put directly into my PayPal account
[20:00.750 --> 20:02.230]  on the third of the month.
[20:02.230 --> 20:03.950]  Now, what I am going to do with those funds
[20:04.790 --> 20:06.310]  is I will use those funds to pay for my website,
[20:06.310 --> 20:08.230]  iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[20:08.230 --> 20:10.310]  That is where I host this podcast.
[20:10.310 --> 20:12.630]  That's my way of keeping the podcast free
[20:12.630 --> 20:13.590]  for the general public.
[20:13.590 --> 20:15.830]  Everybody can listen to this podcast for free.
[20:15.830 --> 20:17.750]  100 episodes of this podcast
[20:17.750 --> 20:19.630]  are always kept in the feed for free,
[20:19.630 --> 20:21.950]  plus I'm updating all of the old episodes on YouTube,
[20:21.950 --> 20:23.470]  so you've got the entire archive
[20:23.470 --> 20:26.150]  to listen to for free forever.
[20:26.150 --> 20:29.090]  I do not need everybody to pay.
[20:29.090 --> 20:30.630]  I want you to listen to this show for free,
[20:30.630 --> 20:32.070]  and I want you to appreciate it.
[20:32.070 --> 20:32.950]  I want you to enjoy it.
[20:32.950 --> 20:35.070]  I want you to learn how to grow better cannabis.
[20:35.070 --> 20:37.510]  I want you to teach people the right ways about cannabis
[20:37.510 --> 20:39.430]  and break the myths and break the truths,
[20:39.430 --> 20:41.670]  support cannabis, legalize cannabis,
[20:41.670 --> 20:45.390]  and get everybody healing themselves with proper cannabis.
[20:45.390 --> 20:47.110]  I want it to happen for free.
[20:47.110 --> 20:48.490]  There are people out there, however,
[20:48.490 --> 20:49.650]  who do want to contribute
[20:49.650 --> 20:51.710]  and who are able to contribute to the show,
[20:51.710 --> 20:53.950]  and those folks can do so
[20:53.950 --> 20:56.990]  by going to patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[20:56.990 --> 20:58.890]  If you can't contribute, I still love you,
[20:58.890 --> 21:00.150]  I still want you to listen,
[21:00.150 --> 21:01.750]  and I still want you on my team.
[21:01.750 --> 21:03.470]  This podcast is still for you.
[21:04.310 --> 21:05.990]  All right, I feel like an evangelist for a minute,
[21:05.990 --> 21:08.190]  so I'm gonna hold off on all this Patreon talk.
[21:08.190 --> 21:12.230]  Let's talk about some ganja-related madness.
[21:13.090 --> 21:14.830]  All right, here's something I've wanted to talk about
[21:14.830 --> 21:17.830]  because it's something I've been experiencing.
[21:17.830 --> 21:19.190]  You guys ever go through phases
[21:19.190 --> 21:22.590]  where sometimes you can smoke all of the hash
[21:22.590 --> 21:25.110]  or all of the weed and nothing happens?
[21:25.110 --> 21:26.750]  Like, I've got days where I feel like
[21:26.750 --> 21:28.310]  I could just open up my shatter
[21:28.310 --> 21:30.310]  and just take half-gram dabs all day
[21:30.310 --> 21:31.830]  and I don't get high properly.
[21:31.830 --> 21:34.190]  Like, I'll get a little bit of a woo for a couple of seconds
[21:34.190 --> 21:36.910]  but then I'm just like, blah, that was fun.
[21:36.910 --> 21:38.510]  And it'll last for days like that,
[21:38.510 --> 21:40.550]  and I'll feel like I just smoke all of my hash
[21:40.550 --> 21:42.430]  and all of my weed and I just keep smoking it,
[21:42.430 --> 21:44.010]  nothing happens.
[21:44.010 --> 21:46.830]  And then one day it'll flip to where
[21:46.830 --> 21:48.550]  I can think about smoking some hash
[21:48.550 --> 21:49.630]  and I just feel high as shit.
[21:49.630 --> 21:51.590]  Like, oh, goddamn, I'm super high.
[21:51.590 --> 21:53.710]  Or some days you can just open up the parchment
[21:53.710 --> 21:55.230]  and before you even get the dabber on the nail,
[21:55.230 --> 21:57.250]  you're like, why am I so high already?
[21:57.250 --> 21:59.310]  Or there's some days I can take just a little dab
[21:59.310 --> 22:01.230]  and get super wrecked.
[22:01.230 --> 22:02.590]  And it's really odd, I've been noticing
[22:02.590 --> 22:05.550]  that I go through phases where I can smoke all of the hash
[22:05.550 --> 22:07.730]  and then it'll flip on me and then I can just barely smoke
[22:07.730 --> 22:08.910]  and get wrecked.
[22:08.910 --> 22:10.470]  And I've been trying to pay attention to a few things
[22:10.470 --> 22:14.230]  and see what causes this and what is related to this.
[22:14.230 --> 22:17.590]  The first thing I would say is it's directly related
[22:17.590 --> 22:18.830]  to my hydration.
[22:18.830 --> 22:21.170]  If I have not been drinking enough water,
[22:21.170 --> 22:23.430]  my lungs hurt when I take a dab, I can feel it.
[22:23.430 --> 22:25.350]  My lungs are like, dude, that's hot, that's dry,
[22:25.350 --> 22:27.790]  fuck you, hydrate yourself.
[22:27.790 --> 22:30.190]  And how much food I have consumed and what kind of food.
[22:30.190 --> 22:33.550]  If I've had a lot of sugary stuff, I can't get high properly.
[22:33.550 --> 22:35.270]  Sometimes if I've had too much caffeine
[22:35.270 --> 22:37.650]  and too many sugary snacks and I take a dab,
[22:37.650 --> 22:38.950]  instead of getting high properly,
[22:38.950 --> 22:41.750]  I just get jittery and anxious and I don't feel good.
[22:41.750 --> 22:44.790]  And I have to wait through the initial high of the dab
[22:44.790 --> 22:47.070]  to feel okay, like a good 15 or 20 minutes later,
[22:47.070 --> 22:49.670]  once the blood sugar and the fucking Mountain Dew
[22:49.670 --> 22:52.110]  or the Dr. Pepper sugar and the cookies and the dab
[22:52.110 --> 22:54.190]  all stop fighting each other.
[22:54.190 --> 22:56.750]  So it's directly related to my hydration
[22:56.750 --> 22:59.670]  and my food consumption and my blood sugar.
[23:00.710 --> 23:03.610]  And all those three together are the main components
[23:03.610 --> 23:06.790]  and it's mostly hydration because I can take huge dabs
[23:06.790 --> 23:08.150]  if I'm well hydrated.
[23:08.150 --> 23:10.430]  If I wake up and just hydrate heavily
[23:10.430 --> 23:11.830]  and then start taking big globs,
[23:11.830 --> 23:15.490]  I can smoke heavy all day and my lungs are okay with it.
[23:15.490 --> 23:17.410]  If I don't drink plenty of water
[23:17.410 --> 23:19.430]  and I start taking big dabs, my lungs burn
[23:19.430 --> 23:20.750]  and then by the late part of the day,
[23:20.750 --> 23:23.590]  I don't wanna dab hard anymore and I'm tired and worn out.
[23:23.590 --> 23:26.230]  So I think a lot of my thing is directly related
[23:26.750 --> 23:29.470]  to hydration, which is directly related to my blood sugar.
[23:29.470 --> 23:31.370]  I feel like when I don't have the right food,
[23:31.370 --> 23:33.270]  I get high and I get lazy and I get wrecked.
[23:33.270 --> 23:35.270]  But if I eat right, I get high and I get uplifted
[23:35.270 --> 23:37.130]  and I feel much better.
[23:37.130 --> 23:40.730]  I also think that a lot of my being able
[23:40.730 --> 23:42.270]  to get really wrecked and not being able
[23:42.270 --> 23:45.450]  to get high properly has stuff to do with the weather.
[23:45.450 --> 23:47.270]  When it's really hot outside,
[23:47.270 --> 23:49.770]  I don't even like to get real high.
[23:49.770 --> 23:51.970]  I missed an, I skipped an opportunity to go smoke
[23:51.970 --> 23:54.550]  with some friends today because it was 90 degrees outside
[23:54.550 --> 23:56.190]  and there wasn't anywhere cool to go smoke.
[23:57.030 --> 23:58.550]  It was just too hot and just being in the car,
[23:58.550 --> 23:59.950]  if we would have gone to the car to smoke,
[23:59.950 --> 24:01.190]  if we would have gone somewhere else to smoke,
[24:01.190 --> 24:03.550]  just being outside back in the heat,
[24:03.550 --> 24:04.870]  it was just gonna fucking ruin my day
[24:04.870 --> 24:06.310]  and give me a headache and make me lazy.
[24:06.310 --> 24:08.150]  So sometimes the weather has stuff to do with it.
[24:08.150 --> 24:10.610]  I don't like to get too blazed in the too hot.
[24:10.610 --> 24:12.810]  When it's cold, let's smoke.
[24:12.810 --> 24:15.670]  I can smoke, like I said, I can smoke all of the hash
[24:15.670 --> 24:17.070]  when it's cold.
[24:17.070 --> 24:19.750]  There's just something about it that I really enjoy
[24:19.750 --> 24:22.990]  being wherever, out in the car, out in the backyard,
[24:22.990 --> 24:25.150]  camping, whatever, let's just smoke when it's cold.
[24:25.150 --> 24:27.110]  I can handle that, my body likes it.
[24:27.110 --> 24:29.870]  And it's probably because I'm not getting so dehydrated
[24:29.870 --> 24:31.470]  and I'm not just trying to survive
[24:31.470 --> 24:33.550]  and my hydration isn't suffering.
[24:33.550 --> 24:36.690]  Another thing that affects my ability to medicate
[24:36.690 --> 24:39.910]  or get high properly is my stress and anxiety level.
[24:40.850 --> 24:43.290]  If I'm stressed, have you guys ever experienced this?
[24:43.290 --> 24:47.170]  Have you been, maybe you got high and you went for a drive
[24:47.170 --> 24:49.710]  or maybe you got high and you had an experience
[24:49.710 --> 24:53.630]  that some adrenaline kicked in and you can't be high anymore.
[24:53.630 --> 24:55.470]  Have you noticed your high just fucking goes away
[24:55.470 --> 24:56.590]  at those points?
[24:56.590 --> 24:58.310]  Or have you ever had just something scare you
[24:58.310 --> 24:59.970]  and just blow your whole high?
[24:59.970 --> 25:01.350]  Like maybe you get pulled over
[25:01.350 --> 25:02.870]  and as soon as you see those red and blues,
[25:02.870 --> 25:05.550]  miraculously, I'm not even high anymore.
[25:05.550 --> 25:07.850]  I think stress kind of blocks my ability
[25:07.850 --> 25:09.070]  to get blazed properly.
[25:09.070 --> 25:11.830]  If I'm too worried about work or podcasting
[25:11.830 --> 25:15.030]  or whatever it is that people worry about nowadays,
[25:15.030 --> 25:17.410]  half the time it's dumb shit that we fucking invented anyway
[25:17.410 --> 25:19.910]  because this is just a fake world that we live in.
[25:19.910 --> 25:21.550]  We should be doing totally different shit
[25:21.550 --> 25:22.450]  than what we do with our lives.
[25:22.450 --> 25:25.130]  But see that stress right there
[25:25.130 --> 25:27.170]  is what I think fucks with my high sometimes.
[25:27.170 --> 25:28.770]  It just doesn't let me get where I wanna be
[25:28.770 --> 25:30.330]  because I'm too stressed with the fucking world
[25:30.330 --> 25:32.130]  and with stupid shit.
[25:32.130 --> 25:34.430]  Also, environment.
[25:34.430 --> 25:37.170]  I feel like when I smoke at this table,
[25:37.170 --> 25:38.410]  at this spot right here,
[25:38.410 --> 25:41.290]  I could never get too high at this spot
[25:41.290 --> 25:42.890]  because I'm in my comfort zone.
[25:42.890 --> 25:44.490]  I've got a bottle of Dr. Pepper right here.
[25:44.490 --> 25:46.170]  I got a bottle of water right here.
[25:46.170 --> 25:47.950]  I got all my apothecary jars right here.
[25:47.950 --> 25:48.850]  My iPad's right here.
[25:48.850 --> 25:49.690]  My phone's right here.
[25:49.690 --> 25:50.510]  My computer's right here.
[25:50.510 --> 25:52.130]  My bed is like 30 steps from here.
[25:52.810 --> 25:54.650]  There's a refrigerator full of goodies right there.
[25:54.650 --> 25:56.370]  I got a TV over there.
[25:56.370 --> 25:58.650]  There's not a lot could go wrong in this environment.
[25:58.650 --> 26:00.890]  So I feel like when I smoke right here,
[26:00.890 --> 26:03.730]  I allow myself to get pretty high,
[26:03.730 --> 26:04.890]  but I get in a bubble.
[26:04.890 --> 26:06.170]  I get in this productive bubble.
[26:06.170 --> 26:07.410]  I wanna clean this area up.
[26:07.410 --> 26:08.650]  I wanna organize all this shit.
[26:08.650 --> 26:10.250]  Then I wanna start writing podcasts.
[26:10.250 --> 26:11.450]  I wanna start,
[26:11.450 --> 26:14.330]  this is my creative zone and my space right here.
[26:14.330 --> 26:16.910]  So when I smoke right here, certain things happen.
[26:16.910 --> 26:20.010]  But if I were to go,
[26:20.010 --> 26:21.290]  I know I keep talking about the car.
[26:21.290 --> 26:22.130]  Sorry, Mike.
[26:22.130 --> 26:23.930]  Sometimes I medicate in my car.
[26:23.930 --> 26:25.610]  The vibe is completely different.
[26:25.610 --> 26:27.850]  I feel like I get much more medicated
[26:27.850 --> 26:28.850]  when I smoke in the car
[26:28.850 --> 26:30.410]  because I'm not in my comfort zone.
[26:30.410 --> 26:32.330]  If I'm a passenger or a driver,
[26:32.330 --> 26:33.810]  if I'm out smoking in the car,
[26:33.810 --> 26:35.970]  I get way more blazed
[26:35.970 --> 26:37.730]  because my mind is more stimulated
[26:37.730 --> 26:39.490]  and I can't just be here in my bubble.
[26:39.490 --> 26:40.330]  When I'm here in my bubble,
[26:40.330 --> 26:41.890]  I don't have to worry about anything.
[26:41.890 --> 26:44.750]  My senses know, you're safe, you can turn off.
[26:44.750 --> 26:45.870]  When I'm out in public,
[26:45.870 --> 26:47.970]  I'm like a fucking deer out in the danger
[26:47.970 --> 26:49.290]  and everything is just blinking at me
[26:49.290 --> 26:50.450]  and I gotta pay attention to it.
[26:50.450 --> 26:52.690]  So when I get blazed, I see that even more
[26:52.690 --> 26:54.350]  and I get even higher from it.
[26:54.350 --> 26:58.130]  So also, I think when I go to places like the Cana Canyon,
[26:58.130 --> 27:00.610]  my high is way different because it's a social high.
[27:00.610 --> 27:03.330]  I've gotta stay, I can't get blackout blazed
[27:03.330 --> 27:04.410]  or silent blazed
[27:04.410 --> 27:05.750]  because sometimes I like to smoke myself
[27:05.750 --> 27:07.370]  into a silent stupor.
[27:07.370 --> 27:08.730]  That's what I enjoy when I'm alone
[27:08.730 --> 27:10.590]  that it makes my mind go and gets me creative
[27:10.590 --> 27:11.810]  and I just start flowing.
[27:11.810 --> 27:13.950]  But I can't do that at places like the Cana Canyon
[27:13.950 --> 27:15.570]  because people wanna talk to me.
[27:15.570 --> 27:18.410]  So I think my environment has a huge part
[27:18.410 --> 27:21.690]  about how my high plays out and how high I'm able to get
[27:21.690 --> 27:23.250]  and just how much I notice.
[27:23.250 --> 27:25.670]  Maybe I don't notice that I'm super high
[27:25.670 --> 27:26.690]  when I'm sitting at this table
[27:26.690 --> 27:28.170]  because nothing can go wrong.
[27:28.170 --> 27:31.070]  And maybe you do notice that you're super blazed
[27:31.070 --> 27:32.890]  after two dabs when you're out at the mall
[27:32.890 --> 27:34.730]  just because you feel like everyone's looking at you
[27:34.730 --> 27:35.850]  just because you're aware.
[27:35.850 --> 27:38.650]  So I think environment plays a huge part
[27:38.650 --> 27:41.650]  in how high I am and am not able to get.
[27:41.650 --> 27:43.170]  One thing I really don't like to do
[27:43.170 --> 27:44.810]  that a lot of my friends love to do,
[27:44.810 --> 27:46.270]  they like to smoke and then eat
[27:46.270 --> 27:48.050]  and I am the exact opposite.
[27:48.690 --> 27:49.890]  I like to eat and then when I'm done eating
[27:49.890 --> 27:51.510]  and I don't need any more food,
[27:51.510 --> 27:53.370]  that's when I toke down and get blazed.
[27:53.370 --> 27:55.090]  Because I feel like if I eat right after I smoke,
[27:55.090 --> 27:56.770]  I pretty much just wasted the food
[27:56.770 --> 27:58.450]  and I wasted those dabs
[27:58.450 --> 28:00.610]  because they're both just gonna balance each other out.
[28:00.610 --> 28:01.850]  They're just gonna negate each other.
[28:01.850 --> 28:03.130]  I won't notice either one.
[28:03.130 --> 28:05.410]  So I eat a big fat meal, get nice and nourished,
[28:05.410 --> 28:08.330]  get comfy, then I chug a little bit of water.
[28:08.330 --> 28:11.750]  And then right after that, the dab time.
[28:11.750 --> 28:13.970]  All right, you guys, I've been rambling for like 30 minutes.
[28:13.970 --> 28:15.250]  I am gonna press pause for a minute.
[28:15.250 --> 28:16.970]  I'm gonna take one of those dabs I've been talking about.
[28:16.970 --> 28:18.930]  I'm also gonna take a couple of drinks
[28:18.930 --> 28:19.910]  and then I will be right back
[28:19.910 --> 28:23.650]  and we are going to read an email from a listener.
[28:23.650 --> 28:25.990]  All right, podcast world, I am back.
[28:25.990 --> 28:26.930]  I got hydrated.
[28:26.930 --> 28:29.250]  I definitely took way too many dabs.
[28:29.250 --> 28:31.810]  I was dabbing this Lemon Jeffery High Cannabinoid
[28:31.810 --> 28:33.530]  Full Spectrum Extract with a little bit of
[28:33.530 --> 28:36.510]  High Terpene Full Spectrum Extract poured into it
[28:36.510 --> 28:38.410]  with a little bit of Dubwise Distillate
[28:38.410 --> 28:39.890]  dropped on top of that.
[28:39.890 --> 28:41.530]  Then I rolled that sticky dab
[28:41.530 --> 28:44.490]  into a little bit of this THCA powder
[28:45.450 --> 28:47.330]  and then I got way too lit.
[28:47.330 --> 28:49.930]  I coughed for about seven minutes.
[28:49.930 --> 28:52.410]  I blew about a gallon of snot out of my nose.
[28:52.410 --> 28:54.370]  Now I think I've got my shit together
[28:54.370 --> 28:55.810]  and we're gonna try to do a podcast.
[28:55.810 --> 28:57.570]  All right, so I got an email from somebody.
[28:57.570 --> 28:59.290]  I'm not sure if I'm supposed to use their name.
[28:59.290 --> 29:00.170]  I'm not going to.
[29:00.170 --> 29:01.590]  We're just gonna skip that.
[29:01.590 --> 29:03.170]  This email comes from a listener
[29:03.170 --> 29:04.210]  and if you'd like to email me,
[29:04.210 --> 29:07.730]  you can send me an email at growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[29:07.730 --> 29:11.030]  Maybe I'll read your email on a future episode.
[29:11.030 --> 29:12.090]  This email goes like this.
[29:12.090 --> 29:14.090]  Hey, brother, did I hear that correctly?
[29:14.730 --> 29:16.290]  And then he says, half asleep on a throwback episode.
[29:16.290 --> 29:17.650]  I can't remember where.
[29:17.650 --> 29:21.370]  Did you say that you switched back to 18-6 for late flush?
[29:21.370 --> 29:22.730]  Do you still do that?
[29:22.730 --> 29:23.730]  Back in the hydro days,
[29:23.730 --> 29:25.850]  I would sometimes put them back into total blackout
[29:25.850 --> 29:27.410]  for the last two or three days.
[29:27.410 --> 29:29.910]  I've never heard going back to more light.
[29:29.910 --> 29:32.390]  Would you mind giving your thoughts behind that?
[29:33.430 --> 29:34.770]  To tell you the truth, bro,
[29:34.770 --> 29:36.330]  I don't think I said that.
[29:36.330 --> 29:38.170]  I hope I did not say that.
[29:38.170 --> 29:41.330]  I do remember one instance where that may be useful.
[29:41.330 --> 29:43.830]  I have talked about revegging your plants.
[29:44.570 --> 29:45.950]  The only reason that I would recommend
[29:45.950 --> 29:48.710]  going to more light at the end of flower
[29:48.710 --> 29:52.830]  would be to revert your plant back to the veg stage.
[29:52.830 --> 29:54.450]  That's the only time it's useful.
[29:54.450 --> 29:57.750]  Do not go back to 18-6 at the end of flowering.
[29:57.750 --> 29:59.250]  If you're going to change your time
[29:59.250 --> 30:01.010]  at the end of your flower period,
[30:01.010 --> 30:04.130]  I would go with more darkness and less light.
[30:04.130 --> 30:08.010]  So maybe go from 12-12 to 14 hours of darkness
[30:08.010 --> 30:09.530]  and 10 hours of light,
[30:09.530 --> 30:11.690]  or maybe increase your dark period,
[30:11.710 --> 30:15.030]  but do not add light to the end of your flowering period.
[30:15.030 --> 30:16.390]  That'll fuck your plants up.
[30:16.390 --> 30:18.110]  It will confuse them.
[30:18.110 --> 30:21.070]  It will make them think that it's time to reveg.
[30:21.070 --> 30:23.090]  They will start reveging.
[30:23.090 --> 30:25.630]  If you want to revege, that is something you can do,
[30:25.630 --> 30:28.790]  but if you don't want to revege the plant, don't do that.
[30:28.790 --> 30:30.390]  You must've been half asleep.
[30:30.390 --> 30:31.790]  You might've been high,
[30:31.790 --> 30:33.550]  and it's fucking weird that you're dreaming about me,
[30:33.550 --> 30:34.630]  but please don't do that.
[30:34.630 --> 30:35.470]  And thanks for the email.
[30:35.470 --> 30:36.290]  There's more to this email.
[30:36.290 --> 30:37.130]  I'm going to keep reading.
[30:37.130 --> 30:39.030]  It says, I really like your show, incidentally.
[30:39.030 --> 30:40.350]  Only recently discovered it.
[30:40.370 --> 30:42.050]  Keep up the good work.
[30:42.050 --> 30:44.170]  Keep up the good hard work ethic, the fun,
[30:44.170 --> 30:46.850]  and I appreciate the rallying content,
[30:46.850 --> 30:48.250]  which is always solid.
[30:48.250 --> 30:49.290]  I learn stuff.
[30:49.290 --> 30:50.230]  I think new thoughts.
[30:50.230 --> 30:51.890]  I respect the point of view too.
[30:51.890 --> 30:53.810]  I'm good with you using the content of this email
[30:53.810 --> 30:56.570]  in any episodes or not as you prefer,
[30:56.570 --> 31:01.530]  but no name please, as I'm in not land.
[31:01.530 --> 31:02.450]  So I think he meant to type,
[31:02.450 --> 31:04.490]  I'm in prohibition land or not legal land.
[31:04.490 --> 31:05.730]  He skipped the word there,
[31:05.730 --> 31:08.550]  but then he says, thanks man, and he signs his name.
[31:08.550 --> 31:10.230]  Dude, thank you for the great email.
[31:11.090 --> 31:15.410]  I hope you did not try to put this 18-6 into practice
[31:15.410 --> 31:16.770]  at the end of your flowering phase,
[31:16.770 --> 31:18.650]  because that would have caused you problems,
[31:18.650 --> 31:19.890]  and then I would have felt like a dick
[31:19.890 --> 31:21.170]  for messing up your crop.
[31:22.670 --> 31:25.090]  Let's talk about the only reason that would be useful,
[31:25.090 --> 31:27.530]  because this is where I'm sure you got this idea.
[31:28.590 --> 31:30.570]  The only time that going to 18-6
[31:30.570 --> 31:32.690]  at the end of your flowering phase would be useful
[31:32.690 --> 31:34.750]  is if you plan to revege that plant.
[31:34.750 --> 31:36.290]  The only time that that's useful
[31:36.290 --> 31:37.810]  is if you do not have a clone.
[31:37.810 --> 31:40.810]  Let's say you got a clone from your friend.
[31:40.810 --> 31:41.730]  You grew it.
[31:41.730 --> 31:43.230]  You thought your buddy had more clones.
[31:43.230 --> 31:44.070]  He doesn't.
[31:44.070 --> 31:46.670]  That weed that you grew about week six, week seven,
[31:46.670 --> 31:49.550]  you realize this is the best fucking weed I have ever grown.
[31:49.550 --> 31:51.250]  I want to grow this more.
[31:51.250 --> 31:52.070]  There are no clones.
[31:52.070 --> 31:53.110]  There are no other options.
[31:53.110 --> 31:55.730]  That's the only plant of that strain left.
[31:56.590 --> 31:58.350]  So here's what you could do.
[31:58.350 --> 31:59.890]  14 days before harvest,
[31:59.890 --> 32:03.230]  you can turn your light timer back to 18-6,
[32:03.230 --> 32:05.790]  or you can put it on 24 hours.
[32:06.790 --> 32:09.250]  That will make the plant start thinking
[32:09.250 --> 32:11.870]  it's time to go back into veg.
[32:11.870 --> 32:14.810]  But that 14 days will not be enough time
[32:14.810 --> 32:17.130]  for the plant to actually return to veg
[32:17.130 --> 32:20.430]  if you cut it down as predicted in 14 days.
[32:21.410 --> 32:24.010]  So you're gonna cut down most of the plant,
[32:24.010 --> 32:27.510]  and you will leave about four, maybe five or six shoots
[32:27.510 --> 32:28.930]  at the very bottom of the plant.
[32:28.930 --> 32:31.350]  Just small little buds with just enough
[32:31.350 --> 32:33.110]  to keep the plant alive.
[32:33.130 --> 32:36.690]  And if you put that back into the 24 or 18-6
[32:36.690 --> 32:38.450]  after you harvest the rest of the plant,
[32:38.450 --> 32:42.690]  the remaining plant will eventually turn itself back to veg.
[32:42.690 --> 32:45.570]  And you're speeding it up and buying yourself time
[32:45.570 --> 32:48.970]  by putting it under the veg flowering cycle
[32:48.970 --> 32:50.330]  while you're in flower.
[32:50.330 --> 32:52.970]  That's just gonna save you time to revert your plant.
[32:52.970 --> 32:54.850]  Also, if you're trying to revert it,
[32:54.850 --> 32:56.690]  feed it a high nitrogen diet
[32:56.690 --> 32:58.850]  and also add some sea kelp to there.
[32:58.850 --> 33:01.570]  There are tricks that you can do with gibberellic acid.
[33:01.570 --> 33:04.590]  I don't have enough experience to talk about it on here.
[33:04.590 --> 33:07.990]  If you wanna research re-vegging your plant
[33:07.990 --> 33:10.990]  by using gibberellic acid, it is very possible.
[33:10.990 --> 33:12.990]  I know somebody who does it.
[33:12.990 --> 33:17.390]  That information is very easily available online.
[33:17.390 --> 33:18.830]  I have not enough experience with it
[33:18.830 --> 33:21.590]  to talk about it myself, but I encourage you to try it.
[33:21.590 --> 33:23.830]  If you don't have a clone of your favorite plant,
[33:23.830 --> 33:25.210]  you can re-veg it.
[33:25.210 --> 33:27.430]  But that's the only time that I think
[33:27.430 --> 33:29.310]  that increasing your light cycle
[33:29.310 --> 33:31.410]  at the end of a flowering phase would be useful.
[33:31.870 --> 33:33.230]  Please, like I said earlier,
[33:33.230 --> 33:35.750]  don't do that to your normal flowering plants.
[33:35.750 --> 33:36.990]  If you're trying to speed them up,
[33:36.990 --> 33:38.750]  if you're trying to make them hardier,
[33:38.750 --> 33:40.270]  if you're trying to make things change,
[33:40.270 --> 33:43.310]  reduce the light because these plants are photosensitive.
[33:44.550 --> 33:47.790]  The light does 90% of the shit to these plants.
[33:47.790 --> 33:49.390]  It gives it all of the signals.
[33:49.390 --> 33:50.990]  It tells it what's going on.
[33:50.990 --> 33:52.030]  If you start adding more,
[33:52.030 --> 33:53.430]  it thinks the days are getting longer,
[33:53.430 --> 33:55.310]  which means it thinks it needs to veg.
[33:55.310 --> 33:57.650]  If you reduce time, it thinks days are getting shorter,
[33:57.650 --> 34:00.390]  which makes it think it needs to finish.
[34:00.390 --> 34:02.970]  Here's a tip that I gave somebody online just recently.
[34:02.970 --> 34:05.850]  This tip was about a very specific strain.
[34:05.850 --> 34:08.370]  There's a strain that goes around Colorado right now
[34:08.370 --> 34:10.770]  that produces very delicious oil.
[34:10.770 --> 34:13.730]  The hash that comes from this plant is fucking delicious.
[34:13.730 --> 34:15.570]  The turps that come out of this are amazing.
[34:15.570 --> 34:18.750]  Top shelf turps, it's what everybody wants.
[34:18.750 --> 34:21.090]  The flowers are ugly as shit.
[34:21.090 --> 34:22.450]  This plant doesn't finish up.
[34:22.450 --> 34:25.210]  It would take, you could probably let this plant go
[34:25.210 --> 34:28.570]  12 to 14 weeks and it would finish up nicely.
[34:28.570 --> 34:30.370]  Most people don't have that much time
[34:31.210 --> 34:32.030]  and they're impatient and they don't understand
[34:32.030 --> 34:33.270]  what's going on.
[34:33.270 --> 34:36.130]  I had the opportunity to play with this plant several times
[34:36.130 --> 34:39.270]  and what I learned, and this was just thinking
[34:39.270 --> 34:41.870]  and trying to figure out how to speed up the plant
[34:41.870 --> 34:45.830]  and thinking what I could do, I simply reduced the time.
[34:45.830 --> 34:49.230]  I go from 12, 12 when I'm in flower,
[34:49.230 --> 34:51.290]  about the end of week seven or eight,
[34:51.290 --> 34:56.190]  I drop it from 12, 12 to 10 on and 14 off.
[34:56.190 --> 34:57.790]  Now I'm giving it 10 hours of daylight
[34:57.790 --> 34:59.090]  and 14 hours of darkness.
[34:59.110 --> 35:01.070]  It thinks the days are getting shorter.
[35:01.070 --> 35:03.170]  I'll let it go for about a week like that.
[35:03.170 --> 35:05.270]  Then I'll take two more hours off.
[35:05.270 --> 35:08.590]  Now I'm only running that light for eight hours a day on
[35:08.590 --> 35:10.450]  and 16 hours a day off.
[35:10.450 --> 35:13.110]  Now this plant is thinking that winter is coming
[35:13.110 --> 35:15.350]  and it says, what the fuck am I gonna do?
[35:15.350 --> 35:17.050]  I must reproduce.
[35:17.050 --> 35:20.250]  So it starts making fatter and fatter buds.
[35:20.250 --> 35:22.150]  The trichomes start ripening up.
[35:22.150 --> 35:23.910]  I make it a little colder in the room,
[35:23.910 --> 35:26.030]  drop it just three or four more degrees,
[35:26.030 --> 35:28.530]  get it nice and chilly in there at night.
[35:28.950 --> 35:31.070]  And those plants will finish up much more quickly.
[35:31.070 --> 35:33.350]  You can cut two to three weeks off of these plants.
[35:33.350 --> 35:35.510]  Instead of 14 weeks, you can finish these plants
[35:35.510 --> 35:36.890]  at 10 or 11 weeks.
[35:36.890 --> 35:38.790]  I've cut them down at the end of week 10
[35:38.790 --> 35:40.670]  and I've considered them to be done,
[35:40.670 --> 35:41.910]  but you've got to speed them up
[35:41.910 --> 35:44.370]  by reducing the timer late in flower.
[35:44.370 --> 35:45.430]  If you do it at week six,
[35:45.430 --> 35:47.590]  you're kind of cutting yourself off of optimal growth.
[35:47.590 --> 35:50.810]  If you do it at week seven, at the end of week seven,
[35:50.810 --> 35:53.510]  you can really start speeding up the finishing time
[35:53.510 --> 35:55.910]  of longer flowering plants.
[35:55.910 --> 35:57.070]  All right, you guys, I want to thank everybody
[35:57.070 --> 35:59.170]  for listening to this semi-short episode.
[35:59.170 --> 36:00.930]  I know I didn't talk a whole lot about cannabis
[36:00.930 --> 36:03.250]  and I did not give a whole lot of useful information,
[36:03.250 --> 36:05.670]  but I hope you had fun hanging out with me anyway.
[36:05.670 --> 36:06.890]  I had a long, productive week.
[36:06.890 --> 36:08.050]  I had a lot of fun.
[36:08.050 --> 36:09.850]  I did not have as much time for the podcast
[36:09.850 --> 36:11.250]  as I would like to have had,
[36:11.250 --> 36:14.170]  but I will bring you a better episode next week.
[36:14.170 --> 36:15.730]  I need to get myself ready to go see
[36:15.730 --> 36:18.490]  the Grateful Dead tomorrow in Boulder.
[36:18.490 --> 36:20.170]  It's not the Grateful Dead, but it's close enough.
[36:20.170 --> 36:21.370]  It's Dead & Co.
[36:21.370 --> 36:24.050]  It is most of the remaining Grateful Dead members
[36:24.050 --> 36:25.970]  that are alive, minus Phil Lesh.
[36:25.970 --> 36:26.870]  Phil's taking it easy.
[36:27.630 --> 36:28.650]  He's staying in California.
[36:28.650 --> 36:29.890]  He's the original bass player.
[36:29.890 --> 36:32.770]  Right now they've got Oteel Burbridge on bass,
[36:32.770 --> 36:36.410]  and also they've got John Mayer on lead guitar.
[36:36.410 --> 36:38.670]  If you haven't seen Dead & Co. with John Mayer on guitar,
[36:38.670 --> 36:39.810]  you're probably going, what the fuck?
[36:39.810 --> 36:41.450]  John Mayer plays guitar for the Grateful Dead?
[36:41.450 --> 36:42.450]  He does.
[36:42.450 --> 36:44.290]  And at first I wanted to hate it.
[36:44.290 --> 36:45.590]  When I heard about this years ago,
[36:45.590 --> 36:46.770]  I was like, they put that dude on guitar
[36:46.770 --> 36:47.610]  with the Grateful Dead?
[36:47.610 --> 36:48.690]  What are they doing?
[36:48.690 --> 36:51.310]  Then I went and saw it and I have no complaints.
[36:51.310 --> 36:52.410]  I'm satisfied.
[36:52.410 --> 36:53.730]  It's fucking perfect.
[36:53.730 --> 36:55.770]  I am amazed at how perfect it is.
[36:55.790 --> 36:57.190]  He is one of us.
[36:57.190 --> 36:58.470]  I've listened to him talk about it.
[36:58.470 --> 36:59.870]  I've seen him play it.
[36:59.870 --> 37:03.190]  No doubt in my mind, John Mayer is one of us.
[37:03.190 --> 37:04.830]  So big shout out to John Mayer
[37:04.830 --> 37:07.190]  for making the Dead & Co. magical.
[37:07.190 --> 37:08.250]  I can't wait to go tomorrow.
[37:08.250 --> 37:10.470]  Shout out to everybody that I got to dance with in Boulder
[37:10.470 --> 37:12.130]  because this is gonna come out on Monday.
[37:12.130 --> 37:13.710]  The show will already have happened.
[37:13.710 --> 37:15.550]  I hope we all had a good time together.
[37:15.550 --> 37:17.990]  Ladies and gentlemen, I would love it if you go to iTunes.
[37:17.990 --> 37:19.550]  If you go to the iTunes store,
[37:19.550 --> 37:21.470]  search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[37:21.470 --> 37:23.310]  find the ratings and review section,
[37:23.310 --> 37:24.170]  type in a little review,
[37:24.170 --> 37:25.790]  let me know what you think about the show,
[37:25.790 --> 37:27.830]  and then give me a star review or a star rating.
[37:27.830 --> 37:30.510]  So far, everybody has given me a five star review.
[37:31.710 --> 37:32.750]  Let me know what you think.
[37:32.750 --> 37:34.310]  Give me what you feel like I deserve.

[38:03.950 --> 38:07.450]  Stop me, shake my hand, tell me what you think.
[38:07.450 --> 38:08.610]  I like making new friends.
[38:08.610 --> 38:10.090]  I'm just as shy as you are.
[38:10.090 --> 38:11.530]  I'm just a normal dude.
[38:11.530 --> 38:12.370]  Say what's up.
[38:12.370 --> 38:13.210]  You never know.
[38:13.210 --> 38:14.570]  I may have a dab, I may have a sticker,
[38:14.570 --> 38:16.330]  I may have a fucking seed pack on me.
[38:16.330 --> 38:18.050]  Say hi, don't be shy.
[38:18.050 --> 38:19.250]  Don't email me later and be like,
[38:19.250 --> 38:20.730]  hey bro, I saw you at this event.
[38:20.730 --> 38:22.410]  I didn't wanna say hi.
[38:22.950 --> 38:24.230]  Fucking walk up and say hello.
[38:24.230 --> 38:25.590]  Fist bump me, I'm cool.
[38:25.590 --> 38:27.270]  The people with me are cool.
[38:27.270 --> 38:28.430]  You might change both of our day.
[38:28.430 --> 38:29.270]  You never know.
[38:29.270 --> 38:30.830]  I wanna meet you, you wanna meet me.
[38:30.830 --> 38:32.830]  Let's hang out, let's be friends, take some dabs.
[38:32.830 --> 38:34.590]  All right you guys, I feel like I'm really rambly
[38:34.590 --> 38:36.710]  after the dabs I took and all the Dr. Pepper I drank,
[38:36.710 --> 38:38.590]  so it's time to wrap up this show.
[38:38.590 --> 38:40.170]  I wanna give a huge shout out to my friend Brett,
[38:40.170 --> 38:42.590]  also known as Mary's Motivation on Instagram.
[38:42.590 --> 38:44.670]  And until next time, take a fat dab
[38:44.670 --> 38:46.230]  and give your mom a hug for me.
