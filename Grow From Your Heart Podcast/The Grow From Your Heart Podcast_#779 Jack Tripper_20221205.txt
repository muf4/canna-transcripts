[01:49.080 --> 01:55.220]  So let's jump right into talking about my strain Jack tripper. A lot of people are going to ask right away
[01:55.220 --> 01:59.900]  Did you name this strain after the character from three's company? And the answer is yes
[01:59.900 --> 02:04.740]  I absolutely did when I was a little kid. I grew up with my mom watching three's company
[02:04.740 --> 02:09.620]  I will always remember that song come and knock on our door and now it's gonna be stuck in your head, too
[02:09.620 --> 02:15.240]  You are welcome. But that is totally where I got the name Jack tripper. It is a Jack the Ripper cross
[02:15.240 --> 02:16.960]  It had to have Jack something in there
[02:16.960 --> 02:24.260]  It gets me so high that I feel like I'm in a psychedelic vortex Jack tripper Jack the Ripper. It was freaking perfect
[02:24.260 --> 02:26.660]  So let's talk more about Jack tripper
[02:26.660 --> 02:29.920]  I really like this strain because I taste like a refreshing
[02:30.160 --> 02:37.600]  Lemon turp with some chemicals and crazy funk to it and I really do enjoy that. It's got its own unique lemon candy
[02:37.600 --> 02:40.860]  We're gonna talk a lot about that lemon flavor, but I really love this
[02:41.460 --> 02:46.760]  Psychedelic buzz that I get from and I talk about like when you take a dab or a fat bong rip of it and that's something
[02:46.760 --> 02:51.880]  We should talk about to the flavors and aromas are totally different in the concentrates than in the flowers in this product
[02:51.880 --> 02:53.960]  But when you hit it the buzz is the same
[02:53.960 --> 02:57.080]  I feel like it unzips the top of my head and just
[02:57.480 --> 03:03.400]  Butterflies and rainbows and psychedelic colors and spirals and musical notes and all kinds of shit just flies out of my head
[03:03.600 --> 03:05.600]  Crazy ideas go into my head
[03:05.760 --> 03:09.080]  This is like psychedelic really thought-provoking
[03:09.800 --> 03:16.520]  Brainspinning almost panic-inducing weed for some people and I really really do enjoy that. It's kind of like a time warp
[03:16.520 --> 03:20.400]  I can smoke a little bit of Jack tripper and I'll think it's been five minutes
[03:20.400 --> 03:25.680]  But the next thing I know it's been all day and I haven't done shit except scroll on my phone and mess around in the house
[03:25.680 --> 03:29.960]  And not get anything done. So I really like that kind of buzz. It's super intense for me
[03:30.520 --> 03:35.800]  It just makes me it's got some blinders to it and I feel like I'm just in my own freaking psychedelic world with it
[03:35.800 --> 03:41.720]  So let's talk a little bit about the parents of Jack tripper. What makes up a Jack tripper plant?
[03:41.880 --> 03:47.680]  This was made with a lemon skunk female. My lemon skunk female is from greenhouse seed company
[03:48.000 --> 03:51.920]  I'm not sure how much I've talked about this lemon skunk plant the seed
[03:51.920 --> 03:56.160]  I grew it from seed. The seed was a gift to me from a person and probably
[03:56.720 --> 04:03.640]  2008 I think I was gifted these seeds to that. I think it was at my birthday 2008 or Christmas 2008 right around there
[04:03.840 --> 04:09.040]  That's when I got these seeds. It was the pack of greenhouse a greenhouse seed company seeds
[04:09.040 --> 04:14.760]  They come in the disc and I say they look like birth control pills because it's a circle and there's multiple seeds in there
[04:14.760 --> 04:18.720]  And they're all different colors and they are all color-coded to what strain they are
[04:18.720 --> 04:21.800]  There was a strawberry haze in there or a strawberry a strawberry haze
[04:22.440 --> 04:24.480]  Lemon skunk there was an amnesia haze
[04:24.600 --> 04:28.920]  There are a few different things in this six pack or five pack of seeds from greenhouse seed company
[04:28.920 --> 04:33.360]  And I had this one seed of lemon skunk to grow and it was amazing
[04:33.360 --> 04:36.000]  I loved it from all the way from the beginning of the girl
[04:36.000 --> 04:39.600]  I could tell that this plant was gonna be special that grew more quickly than everybody else
[04:39.760 --> 04:46.000]  I'd had a great aroma. It looked really appealing. So that is a lemon skunk from greenhouse seed company
[04:46.440 --> 04:50.360]  We're gonna talk more about that one as we go the male plant from this one
[04:50.360 --> 04:52.000]  Oh also that is the same
[04:52.000 --> 04:58.240]  Lemon skunk plant that makes up lemon Jeffrey just to give you an idea of some of the flavors and aromas that will carry through
[04:58.240 --> 05:04.240]  That is the lemon skunk that does make the lemon Jeffrey plant now the male plant I used in this mix is a jack the ripper
[05:04.240 --> 05:10.020]  Male from TGA sub cool seeds big up shout out rest in peace to my buddy sub cool
[05:10.020 --> 05:12.700]  I wanted to work with the the jack the ripper cross
[05:12.700 --> 05:17.860]  I was given permission from miss Jill to work with the jack the ripper and I made a lot of great things
[05:17.860 --> 05:23.540]  I wanted to definitely pollinate my lemon skunk with it because I knew did I get to the goal yet?
[05:23.540 --> 05:24.780]  Yeah, the goal is the next part
[05:24.780 --> 05:27.740]  I knew that I wanted to make that lemon lime
[05:28.020 --> 05:32.460]  Dryer sheet turb sort of a thing and I knew that the buzz would be fucking tremendous
[05:32.460 --> 05:39.840]  I was looking for that limonene terpene lean turb and possibly hoping that the THC V would carry from the jack the ripper
[05:39.880 --> 05:43.920]  Some of the phenotypes will achieve that although I don't lab test a lot of my stuff
[05:43.920 --> 05:49.800]  I've got to let other companies do that other growers because here in Colorado personal grows can't lab test
[05:49.800 --> 05:54.280]  But I made it because I was looking for the lemons of the limes and the dryer sheet turp
[05:54.280 --> 05:57.140]  And I absolutely achieved that we'll talk about that a lot
[05:57.140 --> 05:59.140]  I was hoping for that
[05:59.200 --> 06:02.800]  extreme head buzz that crazy crazy head buzz that comes with it and
[06:02.880 --> 06:07.000]  I got that both of the strains the jack the ripper and the lemon skunk have a good head buzz
[06:07.040 --> 06:09.760]  This gave me a really nice head buzz with some blinders
[06:10.160 --> 06:13.320]  It's like when you put the blinders on a horse and they can't see what's beside them
[06:13.320 --> 06:20.440]  That's how I feel after I smoke this stuff. It's also got a nice euphoric buzz to it some creativity some psychedelic feelings to it
[06:20.440 --> 06:26.760]  a little floating this to it if you smoke enough I do enjoy that and that lemon dryer sheet flavor is just you can't
[06:26.760 --> 06:28.760]  Stop that. All right. Um
[06:29.520 --> 06:33.980]  More of the flavors I wrote down funky skunk lemonade lemon lime candy
[06:34.380 --> 06:39.580]  Limeade lemon cleaner and dryer sheets are the specific flavors and aromas that I wrote down for this podcast
[06:40.140 --> 06:43.940]  Now let's talk about the buzz. I keep talking about this psychedelia
[06:43.940 --> 06:49.260]  It goes straight to your head when I smoke jack tripper if it's a dab if it's a bong rip if it's a joint
[06:49.260 --> 06:51.740]  I feel it goes into my lungs like or
[06:52.460 --> 06:56.020]  However, you're gonna do it. Maybe it's a puff co and you just sit there and suck on it
[06:56.020 --> 06:59.060]  But either way when it gets into my lungs, I feel it go. I'm in here
[06:59.060 --> 07:02.300]  I'm in here and then it goes when it spreads out across my chest
[07:02.460 --> 07:05.300]  But then it goes straight up into my brain and my eyes go
[07:05.500 --> 07:11.180]  They get all heavy and red and then I start feeling my heartbeats are going to do do do do do do do do
[07:11.420 --> 07:13.420]  Until suddenly it feels like my heart's going
[07:14.220 --> 07:18.860]  And the best of ways I like a good panicky weed. It might be a little bit for some people
[07:18.860 --> 07:24.340]  It might be too much for some people. I like a good panicky weed if I walk into Walmart or Target or
[07:25.020 --> 07:29.420]  Anywhere and I go, huh? This is great. I'm not high enough. I gotta walk into Target and go
[07:29.420 --> 07:33.820]  I'm too fucking high to be in here. I need an adult. That's when I know that I did it, right?
[07:33.820 --> 07:35.820]  So I like that good panicky weed
[07:37.300 --> 07:40.460]  All right, where were we I had to pause for a technical difficulty
[07:40.460 --> 07:43.780]  I have regrouped and I think I'm back on track if I do remember correctly
[07:43.780 --> 07:47.100]  I was talking about the buzz that I did achieve from this strain
[07:47.100 --> 07:49.020]  I noticed it goes straight to my head
[07:49.020 --> 07:54.900]  sometimes it gives me the wobbly eyes if you've ever been on the school bus or on the bus as a kid or maybe even
[07:54.900 --> 07:56.780]  As an adult maybe in the car
[07:56.780 --> 08:03.180]  One time I leaned my head on the window of the school bus and the tire vibration coming up through the car
[08:03.220 --> 08:05.340]  Made it vibrate real good and it made my vision go
[08:06.020 --> 08:08.020]  Up and down like I was on a dirt road
[08:08.340 --> 08:13.600]  Sometimes the jack tripper will give you the the I vibrate the the dirt road bumpy vision
[08:13.820 --> 08:16.300]  It's nothing to be worried about I kind of enjoy it
[08:16.300 --> 08:18.660]  I like it when shit happens when I smoke because I
[08:18.860 --> 08:24.720]  Smoke so much that I got to get some sort of effect like something different and unique to really to really notice it
[08:24.840 --> 08:29.080]  I also I wrote down that I get intense deep introspective thoughts
[08:29.120 --> 08:33.680]  It's a very long lasting buzz and it definitely has what I call no ceiling
[08:33.680 --> 08:38.520]  I call it no limit weed a lot of things that I smoke I can smoke so far and get myself
[08:38.600 --> 08:43.100]  So lit and that's as far as I'm gonna go. It's got a peak. It's got a maximum. I maxed out
[08:43.100 --> 08:45.100]  I've reached my saturation point
[08:45.120 --> 08:51.560]  There is something with the jack tripper that there is no and I can just keep smoking and I can put myself in a full-on
[08:51.680 --> 08:56.280]  Fierce state of being too stoned too high too panicky if that's what I choose to do
[08:56.280 --> 09:03.120]  I can achieve that with jack tripper. So that is the buzz that is the consumption. We've got the flavors the aromas
[09:03.320 --> 09:07.960]  Alright, so let's talk about actually growing these plants. A lot of people are going to grow these plants
[09:08.220 --> 09:15.000]  Let's talk about some of the different phenotypical variation and phenotypes, which we may see the obvious
[09:15.520 --> 09:22.140]  Distinctions between these phenotypes I'm going to call them the lemon skunk phenotypes and the Jack the Ripper phenotypes
[09:22.140 --> 09:24.960]  You're gonna see some Jack the Ripper really close phenotypes
[09:24.960 --> 09:29.120]  You're gonna see some lemon skunk phenotypes and you're gonna see some perfect right in the middle
[09:29.120 --> 09:32.280]  So that's basically how it appears when you start breeding and making f1s
[09:32.280 --> 09:38.180]  You see the mom the dad and everything in between and then also you may see some weirdos in there
[09:38.200 --> 09:43.520]  Some of those weirdos that pop up are very longer flowering phenotypes that do get tall and skinny
[09:43.520 --> 09:46.200]  They're easily identifiable early in flower
[09:46.200 --> 09:48.700]  If you don't want a super long flowering phenotype
[09:48.740 --> 09:53.360]  You will notice those are the plants to call the tall super skinny ones if they're not boys
[09:53.360 --> 09:55.900]  They're gonna take a real long time
[09:55.900 --> 10:01.800]  So obviously there's the lemon skunk phenotype and the Jack the Ripper phenotype the Jack the Ripper
[10:01.920 --> 10:05.140]  The flowers from the Jack the Ripper phenotype are more dense
[10:05.140 --> 10:12.360]  It's a tighter more compact bud structure more of a pine cone shape like a long elongated extended stretched out pine cone
[10:13.020 --> 10:20.080]  Those are more lime aromas. The lemon skunk is less dense. Maybe a little bit more. I'm not gonna say fluffy
[10:20.600 --> 10:25.000]  Just not as tight and as dense and rock-hard as the Jack the Ripper phenotype
[10:25.000 --> 10:29.120]  If you've got a phenotype that's a little fluffier a little looser a little more airy
[10:29.120 --> 10:36.020]  That is going to be lemon skunk leaning those will also have more of the lemon candy aromas and flavors
[10:36.020 --> 10:41.500]  Now this lemon candy flavor isn't like lemon peels. It's not like straight-up sour lemons
[10:41.500 --> 10:45.500]  it's more like if you had a box or a bag of or a jar even of
[10:45.860 --> 10:53.220]  Countrytime lemonade powder and you just opened it and got a good smell out of it. That's soft lemon candy lemon sorbet sort of aroma
[10:53.340 --> 10:57.020]  That's what comes from this lemon skunk and that's what you're gonna get in the cross
[10:57.020 --> 11:02.980]  The Jack tripper puts out a lot of that aroma. Those are the lemon skunk dominant phenotypes
[11:03.060 --> 11:07.460]  The lemon skunk has the lemon skunk phenotypes have more node spacing
[11:08.020 --> 11:12.540]  Some of the phenotypes they go up and they curve to the right and then they'll make a node there
[11:12.540 --> 11:17.900]  Then they'll curve to the left and make a node there. It's kind of a jagged left and right alternating pattern
[11:17.900 --> 11:19.660]  That is from the lemon skunk
[11:19.660 --> 11:24.900]  You'll notice if the plant goes straight up and spits branches out of the middle left and right left and right alternating
[11:24.900 --> 11:28.180]  That is the Jack the Ripper the more classic plant look that you're used to
[11:28.340 --> 11:31.460]  The lemon skunk grows up and it like moves out of its way
[11:31.460 --> 11:35.580]  It's it curves to the right and then it'll shoot another shoot out of where it curved from
[11:35.620 --> 11:40.980]  Then it'll go up and curve back left and make another shoot where it curved from and it just goes straight up doing that
[11:41.140 --> 11:44.260]  Continuously those will branch out those will catch up and branch out
[11:44.260 --> 11:45.820]  But it does branch a little differently
[11:45.820 --> 11:50.700]  Than a lot of plants the Jack the Ripper phenotypes tend to branch out more like a Christmas tree
[11:51.020 --> 11:54.920]  More like that classic ganja plant that you're used to seeing that sativa leaf
[11:55.140 --> 12:01.620]  Sativa plant that you always see pictures of that is going to be the Jack the Ripper type phenotype the more Christmas tree structure
[12:01.780 --> 12:05.260]  Tighter node spacing not as elongated spaces between the nodes
[12:05.260 --> 12:11.580]  You'll definitely notice that if you've got long spacing between your inner nodes that is definitely coming from the lemon skunk
[12:11.580 --> 12:13.580]  You're gonna get that lemon skunk trait
[12:13.620 --> 12:21.220]  The Jack the Jack the Ripper pheno is probably more ideal for commercial grows just because it's it's basically easier to grow and those
[12:21.220 --> 12:27.340]  Buds are a little bit more more commercial friendly more appealing more bag appeal is what I'm trying to say
[12:28.140 --> 12:31.860]  The lemon skunk pheno is connoisseur weed that is great herb
[12:31.900 --> 12:37.020]  But it's not as appealing for dispensary herb because it's not as dense as a lot of the dispensaries would like it to be
[12:37.340 --> 12:43.660]  Once it gets thrown in the jar the bag and treated like commercial weed and abused it kind of the buds don't hold as well
[12:43.660 --> 12:50.260]  So you might want the Jack the Ripper phenotype better for your dispensary for your commercial grow if you're making concentrates
[12:50.260 --> 12:52.260]  You want that fluffy phenotype all?
[12:52.860 --> 12:54.980]  Day the phenotype I like
[12:55.540 --> 13:01.060]  It's kind of a 50-50 mix that leans so I guess it can't be 50-50 if it leans one way I'm gonna say it's like
[13:01.900 --> 13:09.900]  6040 the lemon skunk. It's got the lemon skunk flavor the lemon skunk kind of structure with the Jack the Ripper limes and potency to it
[13:10.220 --> 13:13.260]  There's just I can I can spot both of them. I can taste it
[13:13.260 --> 13:15.660]  I can see it because I've worked with both of these plants so much
[13:15.860 --> 13:19.640]  But it's got a thicker stock and it kind of does the left right?
[13:20.360 --> 13:26.120]  The shimmy the the shuck and jibe the axle rose if you want going left and right this plant kind of does that
[13:26.560 --> 13:31.440]  But it makes a long side branching and it branches out really well, so it's got the left right
[13:31.440 --> 13:35.760]  But then it spits out a lot of menorah type branches. It does get one giant major top
[13:35.760 --> 13:40.720]  We'll talk about that in a moment here the main stock gets super thick and then it almost does I
[13:41.440 --> 13:46.880]  Want to say almost it looks like it's webbing so most cannabis plants when they go up and they shoot off another branch
[13:47.120 --> 13:51.280]  It just looks like that branch is coming out of the stock and it just makes a nice branch
[13:51.800 --> 13:54.520]  Some of these phenotypes will do almost a web
[13:54.600 --> 13:59.900]  Like to look and it doesn't appear at the top part of the of the node at the intersection if you will
[13:59.900 --> 14:02.720]  It happens more at the base where the branch comes out
[14:02.720 --> 14:05.840]  So it's hard to describe without drawing or showing you a picture
[14:05.840 --> 14:07.920]  But I'm gonna do my best here with the power of words
[14:08.440 --> 14:11.740]  Most of the time like I said the stock will go straight up
[14:11.840 --> 14:15.920]  Then the branch will come out at like a 45 degree just sticking right out of it
[14:16.600 --> 14:20.240]  At that 45 degree it just looks like an angle there on the top and the bottom
[14:20.240 --> 14:22.240]  It just looks like you just put two sticks together
[14:22.720 --> 14:28.600]  With the lemon skunk phenotype sometimes the bottom part of that it looks really clean instead of just an angle
[14:28.600 --> 14:33.640]  It looks like you kind of took a decorative piece of trim and stuck it in that angle and curved out the angle a little
[14:33.640 --> 14:38.920]  Bit almost maybe the best way I can describe it is this thing between your finger and your thumb?
[14:38.920 --> 14:43.920]  It doesn't just go finger thumb. There's this weird webbing in there the plants kind to do that as well
[14:43.920 --> 14:45.680]  But it's on the bottom part
[14:45.680 --> 14:50.120]  So it would be this way if you're making they're making a seven it'd be down here is where that happens
[14:50.120 --> 14:54.640]  So that shows up if you see that that's not a problem. That's a good phenotype
[14:54.640 --> 14:59.180]  I enjoy that phenotype that passes so much of that lemon candy lemon
[15:00.480 --> 15:06.920]  Sorbet sort of a soft country time lemonade powder lemon heads kind of a thing that phenotype with that webbing in there
[15:06.920 --> 15:09.920]  That's going to have that a lot in my experience
[15:10.440 --> 15:16.480]  You're also gonna see long skinny leaves with long petioles those leaves stick out of the buds
[15:16.480 --> 15:17.760]  Maybe an inch inch and a half
[15:17.760 --> 15:25.520]  Maybe two inches before you even get a leaf a lot of the phenotypes if you do see the phenotype that produces a small
[15:25.520 --> 15:31.160]  Bud cluster on the petiole, so you'll have a leaf you'll have a bud just let's say the microphones the bud
[15:31.160 --> 15:34.720]  You got your big bud then you got leaves sticking out of the sides right just like this
[15:35.280 --> 15:37.480]  Sometimes I'm gonna go this way so you can see
[15:37.840 --> 15:41.280]  Sometimes some of the leaves will make a little bud cluster right here
[15:41.280 --> 15:46.560]  Just on top of the leaf at the middle where the fingers all start coming out where the petiole and the leaves separate and meet
[15:46.880 --> 15:51.480]  You'll get a little tiny nug cluster there. That is not a problem. That is not rare
[15:51.960 --> 15:57.120]  That is because that plant is super happy the plants will do that when they were happy when they are happy
[15:57.120 --> 16:03.240]  I've noticed a lot of Jack the Ripper crosses do that when they are happy about life things with Jack the Ripper in there
[16:03.240 --> 16:05.480]  I noticed it when sub cool was putting out seeds
[16:05.480 --> 16:10.720]  I grew a lot of sub cool stuff if I would get some of his stuff just right it would put out those little bud
[16:10.720 --> 16:13.920]  Clusters right in the petiole. I'm pretty sure that's coming from Jack
[16:13.920 --> 16:18.080]  The Ripper is what causes that cuz sub cool got it. I got it the commonality there
[16:18.080 --> 16:23.000]  Of course is that Jack the Ripper so you'll see those long thin leaves with thin petioles
[16:23.440 --> 16:29.920]  Now there are two different types of leaves that come from these plants. They're both long skinny very serrated leaves
[16:30.280 --> 16:33.800]  However, the Jack the Ripper phenotype doesn't have a
[16:34.480 --> 16:38.320]  Canoe type shape to the leaf. I know that may be
[16:38.840 --> 16:46.040]  Vague and hard to figure out but let me elaborate a little bit the Jack the Ripper has more of a classic cannabis serration leaf
[16:46.040 --> 16:48.720]  It's just got the five fingers that come out. They're serrated
[16:48.720 --> 16:52.920]  They're super skinny, but it just looks like a ganja leaf the lemon skunk
[16:53.280 --> 16:58.960]  The leaf will get real skinny at the base and it gets kind of wider in the middle and then it gets real
[16:58.960 --> 17:04.000]  Skinny and has a nice curve to the shape of the leaf the Jack the Ripper does not have that
[17:04.000 --> 17:10.440]  So that's one good indicator of which way your phenotype is leaning if you've got that curved leaf or just a leaf
[17:10.440 --> 17:14.320]  That just goes out and in you'll be able to tell the difference if you've got that curved leaf
[17:14.320 --> 17:16.320]  You'll definitely know what I'm talking about
[17:16.560 --> 17:22.360]  Most of these phenotypes are going to make beautiful bright green colors with bright bright green pistils
[17:22.360 --> 17:24.360]  They are beautiful and they smell amazing
[17:24.520 --> 17:28.480]  Now since I'm talking about phenotypes, I'm going to give this disclaimer that I give a lot
[17:28.480 --> 17:29.200]  I
[17:29.200 --> 17:33.360]  Told you my favorite phenotype is the one with the thick stock the one that gets the webbing
[17:33.560 --> 17:38.560]  The one that gets that real big fat top Cola and smells like crazy lemon candy and limes
[17:39.240 --> 17:41.240]  That's the phenotype for me
[17:41.440 --> 17:44.440]  That plant is also not the easiest plant in the world to grow
[17:44.440 --> 17:46.320]  There are easier phenotypes
[17:46.320 --> 17:52.960]  Amongst this cross that you could pull out of there and have much better success with with less effort if you're not as experienced of
[17:52.960 --> 17:55.400]  a grower so that the phenotype I love
[17:55.440 --> 18:00.840]  May not be the phenotype that you are going to fall in love with don't let me tell you which phenotype is the best
[18:00.840 --> 18:03.520]  I'm telling you what I like. I've made this analogy before
[18:03.520 --> 18:08.040]  I've driven you to the Jack the trip of the Jack tripper restaurant now
[18:08.040 --> 18:11.120]  You've got to choose off the Jack tripper menu which meal you want there?
[18:11.120 --> 18:13.280]  I'm gonna get this meal you get that meal
[18:13.280 --> 18:19.800]  We may we want the same restaurant, but we might want slight different variations in our entree. So that's up to you to decide
[18:19.840 --> 18:22.840]  The lemon skunk phenotypes are a little more picky at growing
[18:22.840 --> 18:27.880]  That's what I keep leading up to the lemon skunk phenotypes are a little bit more challenging the Jack the Ripper phenotypes
[18:28.200 --> 18:33.960]  Simple to grow anybody could do that the Jack tripper lemon skunk phenotypes are a little deceiving
[18:34.200 --> 18:39.440]  Sometimes if you upset them just a little teeny tiny bit the leaves will turn super yellow
[18:39.440 --> 18:44.480]  Some of the leaves will fall off. They'll start drooping and I'll look like shit this plant just it'll recover
[18:44.480 --> 18:45.080]  It does well
[18:45.080 --> 18:50.200]  If you fart near it if you sneeze in the grow room some of the leaves might just come off of this plant
[18:50.200 --> 18:56.920]  It's finicky. It's picky, but it is worth it the medicine the product that that plant produces the concentrates that come from these plants
[18:56.920 --> 19:03.400]  Are so worth the extra work that it does take the Jack the Ripper phenotype will take anything you throw at it
[19:03.400 --> 19:08.200]  You can top it. You can scrug it pinch it pop it twist it lollipop it
[19:08.760 --> 19:11.080]  Anything you want to do with it. It's worth it
[19:11.080 --> 19:14.360]  It will take it she takes defoliation very well, but
[19:14.920 --> 19:20.760]  Do not over defoliate that lemon skunk phenotype the one that looks more lemon skunky the less
[19:21.320 --> 19:27.720]  Dense buds more airy buds those longer leaves don't over defoliate that one because she doesn't make a lot of leaves anyway
[19:27.880 --> 19:30.760]  She really wants the leaves that are there if you take them off
[19:30.920 --> 19:35.240]  It will piss her off and when you do start pissing her off. It takes a minute for her to recover
[19:35.240 --> 19:38.120]  She's not going to recover. She's not going to get better. She's not going to get better
[19:38.200 --> 19:41.960]  And when you do start pissing her off it takes a minute for her to recover she will come back
[19:42.440 --> 19:47.640]  But she does take a little bit if you don't top the lemon skunk phenotype you get one
[19:48.200 --> 19:53.800]  Giant giant glory, but I recommend topping these plants unless you want to do short sea of green plants
[19:53.800 --> 19:58.200]  I do recommend topping all of these plants, uh spread them out real far. It will be helpful
[19:58.360 --> 20:04.520]  They like a lot of airflow. Let's prevent some mold because the buds are going to get giant. Um,
[20:05.320 --> 20:09.080]  So if you don't top them they're going to get giant giant top colas you're going to have a room full
[20:09.400 --> 20:12.520]  Of giant tops, even if you do spread this out trellis it properly
[20:12.760 --> 20:18.840]  You're going to get a bunch of giant tops in the room pay attention to your vpd laid in flower as these plants get larger
[20:18.840 --> 20:24.120]  They will transpire and respire more. There'll be more moisture in the air. You may need to increase co2
[20:24.520 --> 20:30.120]  Uh decrease humidity you're gonna have giant buds. You're gonna have giant plants. You don't want to risk the uh
[20:30.360 --> 20:36.760]  Run the risk of getting mold inside of these giant buds. So do pay attention to your vpd later in flower
[20:36.840 --> 20:42.280]  I've never had a jack tripper plant mold up on me, but i've had some giant buds that have made me worried about it
[20:42.280 --> 20:47.240]  So I always reduce that vpd just a little bit get it a little drier in the room get more airflow
[20:47.560 --> 20:50.440]  Pay attention to stuff like that if you could top it if you could spread it out
[20:50.760 --> 20:53.800]  Instead of getting one giant bud get a whole bunch of buds amongst the room
[20:54.040 --> 20:59.240]  I would recommend that if you're going to go for just a bunch of glory buds grow small plants and flower them very
[20:59.700 --> 21:05.720]  Quickly, let me catch up on my notes here. Don't over water these plants. These plants do not like to be over watered
[21:06.040 --> 21:08.040]  They do not like to sit in water
[21:08.600 --> 21:11.320]  Sometimes when I go out of town or if i'm doing a holiday thing
[21:11.640 --> 21:16.600]  I will simply over water and just leave a little bit of water in the tray so that I could buy myself two or three
[21:16.680 --> 21:18.200]  days more time
[21:18.200 --> 21:24.040]  These plants do not respond very well to that at all. They'll get pissy. They'll get yellow. They'll start slowing down
[21:24.360 --> 21:29.160]  They'll get droopy the leaves will fall off and turn yellow on you don't do that stuff to these plants they get
[21:29.720 --> 21:31.720]  very very pissy
[21:31.800 --> 21:36.200]  Some of these plants are perfect to top them scrog them out fill a scrog net
[21:36.520 --> 21:40.440]  You will find some phenotypes in here that are beautiful for a sea of green method
[21:40.440 --> 21:45.640]  You'll get that one big glory bud trim off most of the side branching get all that lateral branching out of the way
[21:45.960 --> 21:52.040]  Cram a bunch of them in real tight pack the room. You could pack a lot of weight in one room if you fill it correctly
[21:52.760 --> 21:54.760]  Most of these phenotypes
[21:54.760 --> 22:01.400]  Are going to make giant baseball bat colas the mom plant made giant buds and the father plant made giant buds
[22:01.480 --> 22:04.360]  All of the other phenotypes of the jack the ripper made giant buds
[22:04.680 --> 22:11.080]  You're going to get giant baseball bat donkey dick colas out of these plants. You're going to need some sort of supports
[22:11.480 --> 22:17.560]  I recommend a trellis. I always recommend a trellis spread them out a little bit, but maybe some sticks maybe some tomato cages
[22:17.880 --> 22:21.480]  These will need some sort of support. They're going to get big and beefy
[22:22.200 --> 22:29.080]  Most of these phenotypes if not, all of them are going to triple in size before they finish flowering
[22:29.080 --> 22:29.480]  That's right
[22:29.480 --> 22:33.720]  They're going to triple if you've got six feet of grow space and you've got to keep in mind
[22:34.040 --> 22:38.600]  Space between the light i'm going to say that your grow light is seven to eight feet high
[22:38.840 --> 22:44.840]  That gives you six feet of vertical space to grow in I would recommend you flower these plants when they are two feet tall
[22:45.240 --> 22:50.920]  If you're giving them proper light proper nutrients good airflow if you take good care of them these plants will
[22:51.240 --> 22:56.760]  Triple in size before they are done flowering. So be prepared be prepared for tall plants
[22:56.760 --> 23:00.520]  Don't expect just short plants that are just going to grow and finish i'm telling you now
[23:00.600 --> 23:03.480]  They're going to get tall as shit be ready for that
[23:03.800 --> 23:08.760]  Some of the phenotypes do like to branch out quite a bit so possibly be prepared for branchy plants
[23:09.000 --> 23:11.960]  But they are going to get tall they are going to take up a lot of space
[23:12.280 --> 23:14.360]  Some of them may be a little bit lanky on you
[23:14.680 --> 23:19.720]  Most of the phenotypes that long lanky arm if you don't lollipop too much and trim too much up too low
[23:20.120 --> 23:24.360]  All of that space will fill in and will all fill in with big fat chunky nuggets
[23:24.680 --> 23:26.840]  So don't clean up too much of them on the bottom
[23:27.160 --> 23:30.680]  One thing I definitely recommend is flower the first run early
[23:31.000 --> 23:36.680]  Don't be too stuck on having a major huge harvest on your first crop focus your first run with these plants
[23:36.920 --> 23:41.020]  On just learning what they do and how tall they are going to get and finding your phenotype
[23:41.560 --> 23:47.800]  Find out how tall it's going to get then run it big the second time third time build a relationship with the plant at that rate
[23:48.120 --> 23:50.120]  These plants are super easy to trim
[23:50.120 --> 23:54.600]  They don't produce a lot of large leaves and all of the sugar leaf on there all the small leaf
[23:54.760 --> 23:57.400]  Whatever you guys want to call it in your location wherever you are
[23:57.720 --> 24:03.320]  All of that leaf is going to be so frosty that if you're making concentrates don't waste time cutting that off of there
[24:03.400 --> 24:09.000]  You can do a pre-harvest defoliation by taking off all of the giant leaves any leaf with a petiole
[24:09.160 --> 24:11.800]  Right before harvest pull that shit off get that off of there
[24:12.120 --> 24:15.080]  Then chop down the plants let them dry for a few days and go back
[24:15.400 --> 24:20.360]  And just manicure all that small leaf off and keep that small leaf and make edibles or concentrates out of it
[24:20.600 --> 24:27.100]  Because all of the leaves on these plants are coated in trichomes. So they're super easy to trim they make amazing concentrates
[24:27.720 --> 24:29.160]  super delicious
[24:29.160 --> 24:32.760]  Almost panic inducing concentrates if you make rosin if you make bho
[24:33.080 --> 24:37.640]  Uh any type of concentrates if you're just pressing it, uh, if you're making bubble, however, you do it
[24:37.800 --> 24:42.520]  These concentrates will give you that like straight to the eye straight to the head where you're like, oh shit, man
[24:42.600 --> 24:47.320]  I'm too high for this what's going on and nothing's going on man. You're just high bro. I really like it
[24:47.320 --> 24:51.800]  It's like sweaty palms sweaty armpit kind of weed you're like looking for your keys and shit
[24:51.800 --> 24:55.640]  But your keys are in your hand like that's that's definitely the kind of herb that this is
[24:55.960 --> 25:00.060]  No, i've talked about phenotypes. We've talked about the buzz. We've talked about the flavors and aromas
[25:00.520 --> 25:03.480]  Let's talk a little bit about feeding these plants
[25:03.880 --> 25:09.000]  One thing i've really noticed with the jack tripper plants is they tend to like a little bit higher ph
[25:09.080 --> 25:11.320]  Than most of the things I breed and grow
[25:11.800 --> 25:16.060]  Most of the time I feed my plants a ph somewhere between 6.1
[25:16.840 --> 25:22.440]  And 6.4. I run in a soilless mix. I mix up my nutrient throw my ph pen in there
[25:22.680 --> 25:25.560]  I like 6.1 to 6.4 is usually where I aim for
[25:26.200 --> 25:31.960]  These plants seem to act better in 6.6. I was noticing something just wasn't right
[25:32.200 --> 25:36.140]  So I just increased that ph just a little bit. They were not uptaking nutrients
[25:36.540 --> 25:42.300]  Upcrease that increase that ph just a little bit guess what the little fuckers took off and started eating everything I was giving them
[25:42.700 --> 25:48.620]  I'm, not sure if it was potassium or calcium that they were lacking but one of them was not uptaking
[25:48.860 --> 25:53.900]  Uh in their late veg phase early flower phase as soon as I increased that ph
[25:54.220 --> 25:59.820]  They took right the fuck off and started eating everything. I was feeding them. There were no feed problems at all
[26:00.300 --> 26:06.140]  So maybe uh, if you're experiencing any issues with these plants a little bit of yellowing a little bit of slowed growth
[26:06.460 --> 26:12.860]  Increase that ph just a little bit my experience. I grew these plants. Most of my grow is usually in a soilless mix
[26:12.940 --> 26:14.940]  I'm, not super picky about the soilless mix
[26:14.940 --> 26:20.860]  I buy I like to buy especially since we had all these fucking shipping delays and everything was weird and my local grow shop closed
[26:20.940 --> 26:24.540]  Down so I got to drive fucking to another city right now to buy soil or soilless mix
[26:24.860 --> 26:30.860]  I buy what they've got a lot of what will fill my needs because sometimes what I like and what I prefer is not there
[26:30.860 --> 26:34.700]  So I try to be flexible and adapt to what I can get i'm getting soilless mix
[26:34.700 --> 26:40.060]  I think I was using hp pro mix with the mycorrhiza this time because that's simply what was available
[26:40.300 --> 26:45.580]  I feed it new millennium bottled nutrients with a little bit of recharge. I like to put plus life in there
[26:46.060 --> 26:48.860]  During the boosting phase. I like to give it what's one
[26:48.860 --> 26:49.980]  I always forget the name of you guys
[26:49.980 --> 26:53.020]  You guys know what i'm talking about people are yelling at their fucking phones right now
[26:53.340 --> 26:59.020]  Saying that product is called bud swell rasta. Jeff bud swells the other product I like to use and then add some shine in there
[26:59.420 --> 27:04.620]  Um, of course some fulvic acid some ruby, um, and then a few other small things and there may be some green sensation
[27:04.700 --> 27:07.900]  You never know what I might be adding in but in my soilless mix
[27:07.900 --> 27:11.040]  I noticed they did prefer a little bit high ph like a 6.6
[27:11.900 --> 27:16.140]  Um, they seem more green and just healthier and more active at that higher ph
[27:16.300 --> 27:22.380]  The plants seem to like most of these growth styles I saw pictures of these plants being grown on a five by five table
[27:22.780 --> 27:25.420]  Uh the what is it when you flood to drain table?
[27:25.660 --> 27:28.220]  Uh, they were just recycling the flood to drain water
[27:28.460 --> 27:34.140]  They had uh rockwool cubes on there these plants from the base of that rockwool cube up to the tip of these plants
[27:34.380 --> 27:37.020]  Was just all nuggets. I was fucking impressed with that
[27:37.580 --> 27:42.540]  Uh, let's talk a little bit. So these plants seem to like the hydro is something that i'm leading at they like soilless mix
[27:42.780 --> 27:44.780]  They like hydro they seem to like anything
[27:45.260 --> 27:51.260]  Um, they like a humid room but be careful late in flower because the buds are going to get huge
[27:51.340 --> 27:53.100]  These are tropical plants
[27:53.100 --> 27:59.180]  They got that skinny leaf and they tend to react very well to a little bit of a humid room more humid than usual
[27:59.500 --> 28:03.100]  But be careful because you're going to get big chunky buds at the end
[28:03.500 --> 28:08.160]  These plants also like a lot of light. I've never burned these plants with my leds
[28:08.560 --> 28:15.700]  I'm running, uh canon leds in one room and I get these plants fairly close and they have never been burned from the leds
[28:16.640 --> 28:21.680]  These plants do act very well and react very well to just conventional light cycles
[28:21.680 --> 28:26.320]  I usually run 18 6 or 19 5 for my veg. They liked that very well
[28:26.800 --> 28:30.560]  They like 12 12 or 11 13 very well one thing I noticed
[28:31.280 --> 28:35.440]  They don't seem to like modified or alternate light schedules
[28:35.520 --> 28:38.500]  You guys notice i've been talking about different light schedules on my podcast
[28:39.200 --> 28:42.640]  Don't do that to jack tripper. They don't seem to like it
[28:43.360 --> 28:50.080]  They like moderate feeding too much nitrogen in the flowering phase will give these plants what I call the spiral staircase
[28:50.080 --> 28:54.720]  I talk about this often in my opinion if you overfeed your plants too much nitrogen in the beginning
[28:54.880 --> 28:57.920]  They start to stretch a little bit and when the bud starts forming
[28:58.320 --> 29:03.600]  It doesn't cluster up here and cluster up here and meet it starts doing a little bud here a little bud here a little bud
[29:03.600 --> 29:09.600]  Here and it just does the spiral staircase. It never stacks properly. They never meet up the way that they should they don't form properly
[29:10.000 --> 29:16.580]  Uh, that's just from overfeeding that is my opinion. So don't overfeed these plants some of these phenotypes
[29:16.800 --> 29:17.040]  uh
[29:17.040 --> 29:20.240]  they'll kind of stretch out too much if you overfeed them, but some of them will get
[29:20.620 --> 29:27.460]  Fingery and foxtaily and start making little nubs on the buds and little fisty shaped buds that don't look pretty so don't overfeed
[29:28.160 --> 29:29.200]  those
[29:29.200 --> 29:32.000]  Jack tripper plants are going to take honestly
[29:32.480 --> 29:39.440]  10 or more weeks to finish if you are not ready for a 10-week plant don't commit to jack tripper seeds
[29:39.680 --> 29:46.640]  These are labeled 10 plus weeks. You're looking at 70 to 77 maybe more days to finish these plants
[29:47.040 --> 29:52.320]  Most of the phenotypes are done around day 72. There are outliers. There are always outliers
[29:52.320 --> 29:59.840]  There may be earlier there may be later but prepare for 72 to 75 solid days before these plants are ready to harvest
[30:00.000 --> 30:05.280]  I know I say this a lot when I talk about harvest times, but it's very important to let these plants finish
[30:05.680 --> 30:10.800]  These plants really do something extra in the last week of flowering. They really put on some density
[30:10.880 --> 30:16.000]  They really bulk up a little bit while you're waiting for those trichomes. They look like they're ready. They look like they're ready
[30:16.080 --> 30:17.520]  They're just not ready
[30:17.520 --> 30:22.080]  Give them time to get ready because they're bulking up. They're adding more weight. They're getting better as you wait
[30:22.320 --> 30:24.960]  Don't be impatient with these plants. Let them finish
[30:25.520 --> 30:28.800]  If you give these plants the opportunity to finish you will see right at the end
[30:28.880 --> 30:33.760]  They do bulk up and beef up just a little bit extra on their own. Don't change anything
[30:33.840 --> 30:37.920]  Do what you normally do you'll notice that they do finish up quite nicely
[30:38.320 --> 30:42.800]  All right, that basically wraps up my report on jack tripper, but I do have one more detail
[30:42.880 --> 30:47.840]  I want to address in this episode when people are shopping for seeds. They often ask me
[30:47.920 --> 30:54.080]  What is the difference between john lemon and jack tripper? They're quite similar. They're also quite different
[30:54.080 --> 30:56.080]  Let's talk about both of these strains
[30:56.080 --> 31:04.000]  Like i've mentioned jack tripper is a lemon skunk female and a jack the ripper male you get a lot of soft
[31:04.320 --> 31:08.240]  Candy lemon flavors now. Let's talk a little bit about john lemon
[31:08.480 --> 31:13.360]  That is a sour diesel female and a bc lemon skunk male
[31:13.440 --> 31:18.880]  So you're getting a lot of that sour lemon flavor, but there's also a funky diesel thing to it
[31:18.960 --> 31:25.860]  So the main differences in these two strains are going to be that the jack tripper is more of a soft lemon candy lemon sorbet
[31:26.380 --> 31:30.160]  Countrytime lemonade gentle lemon candy sort of a flavor
[31:30.560 --> 31:37.920]  The john lemon is more of a lemon peel sour lemons astringent kind of a pissy cat piss kind of a funky sour
[31:38.320 --> 31:41.920]  Gross, but delicious lemon aroma and flavor
[31:42.160 --> 31:47.040]  So if you like that lemon candy, I recommend jack tripper if you're into the pissy sour lemons
[31:47.200 --> 31:52.400]  I will recommend john lemon and when I say pissy sour lemons, I know that sounds gross
[31:52.640 --> 31:56.880]  But if you're a cannabis connoisseur, you know how delicious that really is
[31:57.120 --> 31:57.440]  All right
[31:57.440 --> 32:01.040]  That is my report on jack tripper if you're looking for a pack of jack tripper
