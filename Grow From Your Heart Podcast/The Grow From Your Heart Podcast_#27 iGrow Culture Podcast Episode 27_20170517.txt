[00:00.000 --> 00:04.200]  Yo, it's Bobby Hustle representing for the real big bad sound, Joseph Star.
[00:04.200 --> 00:06.600]  And the boy can't play with like no broken guitar.
[00:06.600 --> 00:09.000]  Hey yo, Nick and T, you know we stay smoking hard.
[00:09.000 --> 00:10.000]  It's the hustle.
[00:10.000 --> 00:36.720]  What's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:36.720 --> 00:42.160]  Welcome to episode number 27 of the iGrow Culture podcast.
[00:42.160 --> 00:43.160]  They call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:43.160 --> 00:44.160]  I'm your host.
[00:44.160 --> 00:45.160]  Thanks for joining me.
[00:45.160 --> 00:47.760]  We've got a very news filled episode for you guys this week.
[00:47.760 --> 00:49.240]  Joining me across the table is my buddy Adam.
[00:49.240 --> 00:50.240]  How you doing, buddy?
[00:50.240 --> 00:51.240]  What's up, man?
[00:51.240 --> 00:52.240]  I'm high.
[00:52.240 --> 00:53.480]  I'm certainly not low.
[00:53.480 --> 00:55.760]  Thanks for joining me tonight for another episode, bro.
[00:55.760 --> 00:56.760]  Absolutely, man.
[00:56.760 --> 00:58.320]  It is 420 and we are doing it right.
[00:58.320 --> 00:59.320]  We are doing 420 right.
[00:59.320 --> 01:04.960]  We had a little 710 with our 420, smoking a big old fat joint of some heart of gold.
[01:04.960 --> 01:07.000]  Even this afternoon.
[01:07.000 --> 01:12.240]  Anyway, this episode will be filled with a bunch of news and some chatting because this
[01:12.240 --> 01:15.500]  weekend, the weekend that just passed by the time this comes out, this will be out on a
[01:15.500 --> 01:16.500]  Monday.
[01:16.500 --> 01:21.320]  That means that the weekend I got to see Fish at Dick's in Denver and they played all of
[01:21.320 --> 01:24.000]  my favorite songs and we had a wonderful time.
[01:24.000 --> 01:25.760]  So that's my prediction.
[01:25.760 --> 01:27.240]  Hopefully that comes true.
[01:27.240 --> 01:32.520]  So let's get to some ads real quick here and then we'll get into some news.

[03:27.840 --> 03:29.960]  and then we, Adam and I are gonna come back
[03:29.960 --> 03:32.080]  and review a little bit of news.
[03:32.080 --> 03:33.160]  We haven't done the news in a while.
[03:33.160 --> 03:35.200]  So we're gonna get you nice and caught up.
[03:35.200 --> 03:37.600]  I am gonna turn up Nick a tee for a couple of seconds
[03:37.600 --> 03:38.540]  while I take a dab.
[03:38.540 --> 03:41.200]  Adam, if you wanna say anything, now's your chance, buddy.
[03:41.200 --> 03:43.040]  No, I'm pretty good right now.
[03:43.040 --> 03:45.160]  You know, and the way you look, it may be best
[03:45.160 --> 03:47.160]  if you just keep your head down right now, bro.
[03:47.160 --> 03:49.000]  All right, I'm here, people.
[03:49.000 --> 03:49.840]  He's there.
[03:49.840 --> 03:52.200]  He's, no, I'm not even sure he's there, you guys.
[03:52.200 --> 03:53.360]  Hang on, I need a dab.
[03:53.500 --> 04:11.180]  All right, I wanna give a huge shout out to Spence
[04:11.180 --> 04:13.020]  and the entire Garden of Weedon crew.
[04:13.020 --> 04:20.970]  I'm dabbing some live resin.
[04:20.970 --> 04:22.570]  What's strange is that I'm so high, I just took a dab.
[04:22.570 --> 04:24.470]  I can't even remember what it's called.
[04:25.850 --> 04:26.690]  Yeti OG.
[04:26.690 --> 04:28.010]  It's the Yeti OG, thanks, bro.
[04:28.010 --> 04:30.170]  It's written on there, but it's upside down over there.
[04:30.170 --> 04:31.010]  I can't see it.
[04:31.010 --> 04:33.010]  It's Yeti OG live resin.
[04:33.010 --> 04:34.730]  It's dank, it's so high, I couldn't remember the name,
[04:34.730 --> 04:37.170]  or it's so dank, I couldn't remember the name of it.
[04:37.170 --> 04:39.170]  It's so dank, I couldn't remember the name of it.
[04:39.170 --> 04:41.130]  It's so dank, I couldn't remember the name of it.
[04:41.190 --> 04:43.270]  Or it's so dank, I couldn't remember the name of it.
[04:43.270 --> 04:44.830]  I'm all dabbed out right now,
[04:44.830 --> 04:46.150]  and everything sounds like I'm in a tunnel.
[04:46.150 --> 04:47.670]  It's epic.
[04:47.670 --> 04:48.950]  I just said the word epic.
[04:48.950 --> 04:51.070]  All right, guys.
[04:52.650 --> 04:55.690]  I am going to cough my brains out,
[04:55.690 --> 04:58.030]  and then we're gonna scroll to some news.
[05:00.230 --> 05:01.070]  All right, check this out.
[05:01.070 --> 05:03.230]  This news I found entertaining.
[05:03.230 --> 05:05.510]  This is coming from the Cannabis,
[05:05.510 --> 05:09.350]  and it is by Ricardo Baca from the Cannabis staff.
[05:09.370 --> 05:12.050]  The topic says, pot shop owner,
[05:12.050 --> 05:15.650]  80% of our customers come from out of state.
[05:17.530 --> 05:18.810]  Adam's over there shaking his head.
[05:18.810 --> 05:19.930]  You're an out of stater, bro.
[05:19.930 --> 05:20.770]  I am an out of stater.
[05:20.770 --> 05:21.590]  You're out of state.
[05:21.590 --> 05:23.410]  ID qualifies you as out of stater.
[05:23.410 --> 05:25.730]  But I'm no longer an out of stater.
[05:25.730 --> 05:26.970]  You know, I'm a resident.
[05:26.970 --> 05:28.490]  I've been here longer than six months.
[05:28.490 --> 05:30.690]  Yeah, but they don't realize that when they check your-
[05:30.690 --> 05:31.730]  No, totally not.
[05:31.730 --> 05:36.730]  But I just, I feel that because I'm a red card patient,
[05:37.150 --> 05:40.630]  and the place that has my card,
[05:40.630 --> 05:42.790]  or the place that I like to go to anyways,
[05:42.790 --> 05:45.150]  my preferred place is now recreational,
[05:45.150 --> 05:47.910]  and it's a line.
[05:47.910 --> 05:49.910]  There's a line to get in, to get your meds?
[05:49.910 --> 05:51.110]  It's the same place.
[05:51.110 --> 05:53.390]  You know, they can only take the same one,
[05:53.390 --> 05:55.270]  two people back at one time,
[05:55.270 --> 05:56.950]  and it's the same building, same-
[05:56.950 --> 05:59.350]  How long does that line take you now?
[05:59.350 --> 06:01.310]  I haven't been out there since they've really done it,
[06:01.310 --> 06:02.430]  besides one or two times.
[06:02.430 --> 06:04.310]  And one time I've walked right in there,
[06:04.310 --> 06:05.550]  because there was nobody in there.
[06:05.570 --> 06:08.450]  But the other times there's been five or six people
[06:08.450 --> 06:10.330]  ahead of me, and people walk in behind me,
[06:10.330 --> 06:12.130]  and they're like, oh no.
[06:12.130 --> 06:13.530]  And they just turn around and walk out.
[06:13.530 --> 06:14.830]  Yeah, that's a long time to wait.
[06:14.830 --> 06:16.410]  We used to have a shop downtown.
[06:16.410 --> 06:17.810]  They're not hurting for the business.
[06:17.810 --> 06:19.350]  People would wait in line for an hour,
[06:19.350 --> 06:21.730]  because the whole front of the place would be full.
[06:21.730 --> 06:24.530]  All right, I'm gonna get into this article a little bit.
[06:24.530 --> 06:28.570]  Ryan, it says, Ryan Griego owns a recreational pot shop
[06:28.570 --> 06:30.850]  in Southern Colorado.
[06:30.850 --> 06:33.450]  And he's putting out a bold, informed estimate,
[06:33.470 --> 06:37.070]  saying that a decidedly clear majority of his customers
[06:37.070 --> 06:38.550]  are from outside of Colorado.
[06:38.550 --> 06:39.470]  I'm gonna take a big breath here,
[06:39.470 --> 06:41.810]  because I can't even read after that dab.
[06:41.810 --> 06:44.310]  I think the dispensary this guy is from is actually,
[06:44.310 --> 06:46.550]  they posted a really cool shot of the can of sewer
[06:46.550 --> 06:48.230]  in this article online here.
[06:48.230 --> 06:50.510]  A really cool angle of the sign in the building.
[06:50.510 --> 06:53.630]  Stylish looking place with a great Colorado background.
[06:53.630 --> 06:55.070]  Is that a dope shot?
[06:55.070 --> 06:55.990]  A dope shot, right?
[06:55.990 --> 06:56.990]  Ha ha ha.
[06:56.990 --> 06:58.710]  I didn't even mean that pun.
[06:58.710 --> 07:00.670]  All right, I'm back on my game, let's go.
[07:00.670 --> 07:02.970]  80% of my customers are coming from other states,
[07:03.470 --> 07:06.470]  predominantly Texas, New Mexico, Kansas, and Arizona,
[07:06.470 --> 07:09.310]  said Griego, owner of Can of Sewer in Pueblo West,
[07:09.310 --> 07:10.990]  which opened its doors in May
[07:10.990 --> 07:13.170]  for recreational marijuana sales.
[07:13.170 --> 07:15.470]  I knew there would be out of state customers coming in,
[07:15.470 --> 07:18.310]  but I thought it would be more of a 30-70 split
[07:18.310 --> 07:20.790]  with 30% of my customers from out of state.
[07:20.790 --> 07:24.150]  But it's more severe than that on the flip flop.
[07:24.150 --> 07:26.150]  I don't think severe was the right word.
[07:26.150 --> 07:29.270]  Out of state tourists account for 44% of all retail sales
[07:29.270 --> 07:32.790]  in the Denver area, and about 90% in mountain resorts,
[07:33.490 --> 07:35.810]  such as Aspen or Telluride, according to a recent study
[07:35.810 --> 07:38.830]  produced by the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division.
[07:38.830 --> 07:39.670]  Guys, we've talked about
[07:39.670 --> 07:42.530]  the Marijuana Enforcement Division, or the MED.
[07:42.530 --> 07:44.570]  They're the guys, the division in charge
[07:44.570 --> 07:48.250]  of regulating the dispensaries and the grows
[07:48.250 --> 07:49.090]  and all of that stuff.
[07:49.090 --> 07:50.890]  They are in charge of the marijuana,
[07:50.890 --> 07:52.710]  and they regulate all of that stuff.
[07:52.710 --> 07:57.710]  They make the rules, and they are also a branch of the IRS.
[07:58.090 --> 07:59.130]  So that's pretty legit.
[07:59.130 --> 08:01.250]  They're a huge place, they make a lot of rules.
[08:01.310 --> 08:04.230]  They fucking put their foot down, and it matters.
[08:04.230 --> 08:07.030]  Guys, tweet me every time I say the F word.
[08:07.030 --> 08:08.510]  Every time I say fuck, just tweet me
[08:08.510 --> 08:09.830]  and tell me to stop doing it, please,
[08:09.830 --> 08:12.230]  because I'm trying to stop doing that on the show.
[08:12.230 --> 08:14.030]  Trying to cut that word out of my vocabulary.
[08:14.030 --> 08:16.590]  It's not even a cool word to use for anything.
[08:16.590 --> 08:19.590]  But anyway, but for a shop in Pueblo,
[08:19.590 --> 08:21.910]  hardly considered in the same tourism league
[08:21.910 --> 08:24.750]  as Aspen or Telluride to make 80% of its sales
[08:24.750 --> 08:28.110]  to out of state visitors is something of an anomaly,
[08:28.110 --> 08:30.070]  even given Pueblo's proximity,
[08:30.090 --> 08:33.650]  less than 100 miles to the New Mexico state line.
[08:33.650 --> 08:35.250]  They're not joking at all about the differences
[08:35.250 --> 08:38.530]  between Aspen, Telluride, compared to Pueblo.
[08:38.530 --> 08:41.890]  Pueblo is, it's a cool place if you live here
[08:41.890 --> 08:42.730]  and you know where you're going,
[08:42.730 --> 08:45.970]  but it's a steel town, it's a steel mill town,
[08:45.970 --> 08:47.610]  it's a blue collar working man's town,
[08:47.610 --> 08:49.430]  and Aspen and Telluride are places
[08:49.430 --> 08:50.610]  where you go to spend some time.
[08:50.610 --> 08:53.650]  We don't have, we have a reservoir here,
[08:53.650 --> 08:54.770]  we've got a river walk here,
[08:54.770 --> 08:57.050]  we've got some really cool trails and things.
[08:57.050 --> 08:59.490]  There's a castle about 30 minutes from here.
[08:59.870 --> 09:01.610]  Pueblo is definitely nice to come and see,
[09:01.610 --> 09:06.610]  but there's nothing here to like, oh, Pueblo has this.
[09:06.630 --> 09:08.790]  It has everything that a normal town has,
[09:08.790 --> 09:09.630]  and it's pretty.
[09:09.630 --> 09:10.470]  That's.
[09:10.470 --> 09:12.470]  Yeah, so to say that 80% of our sales
[09:12.470 --> 09:15.510]  are going to out of state visitors is kind of shocking.
[09:15.510 --> 09:18.190]  Well, we have a lot of recreational weed shops here,
[09:18.190 --> 09:20.350]  and the shop that you're talking about
[09:20.350 --> 09:22.270]  is 100% recreational.
[09:23.230 --> 09:24.350]  So.
[09:24.350 --> 09:25.870]  Do you think that the numbers are the same
[09:25.870 --> 09:28.070]  across the board at the shops, at the rec shops,
[09:28.070 --> 09:29.110]  that it's 70-30?
[09:29.650 --> 09:30.870]  I think it depends on your product.
[09:30.870 --> 09:32.730]  That's true, and that's something I was gonna get at,
[09:32.730 --> 09:35.330]  because the reason that the Colorado market
[09:35.330 --> 09:37.530]  is not shopping at a recreational shop,
[09:38.370 --> 09:40.230]  we're either, and I haven't read this article
[09:40.230 --> 09:41.630]  in advance very well, I skimmed it,
[09:41.630 --> 09:43.930]  because I found it interesting for the show.
[09:43.930 --> 09:46.250]  I think that a Colorado resident, like you did,
[09:46.250 --> 09:47.190]  you became a resident,
[09:47.190 --> 09:49.130]  you got your medical marijuana recommendation
[09:49.130 --> 09:50.610]  from a doctor, you've got your red card,
[09:50.610 --> 09:52.290]  now you can shop at a medical shop
[09:52.290 --> 09:56.550]  and not pay the 25% tax that's added onto the rec weed.
[09:56.690 --> 10:01.170]  And you get better herb there, I think, at the med shops.
[10:01.170 --> 10:05.030]  But also, most of the Colorado residents have been here
[10:05.030 --> 10:07.650]  and weed, have a guy, or a caregiver,
[10:07.650 --> 10:08.850]  or just, you've got the hookup already.
[10:08.850 --> 10:10.290]  Or you start growing your own.
[10:10.290 --> 10:11.250]  Or you're growing your own.
[10:11.250 --> 10:14.330]  I used, I literally used the rec shops
[10:14.330 --> 10:18.290]  until I got my red card, and then once I got my red card,
[10:18.290 --> 10:22.570]  then I used it all the time, you know what I'm saying?
[10:22.570 --> 10:24.290]  I went into the rec shop with somebody
[10:24.290 --> 10:25.490]  who just came here recently,
[10:25.510 --> 10:27.270]  and I was looking for a certain product,
[10:27.270 --> 10:29.070]  and that's, I went in there,
[10:29.070 --> 10:31.710]  because for one, she had never done it before,
[10:31.710 --> 10:34.790]  and it's an experience, you know, everybody should go.
[10:34.790 --> 10:36.110]  Yep, there you go.
[10:36.110 --> 10:37.310]  Stuff is amazing.
[10:37.310 --> 10:42.310]  I've got a bottle of Apothicanna Extra Strength Pain Cream,
[10:42.310 --> 10:44.710]  Arnica, Peppermint, Juniper, Cannabis.
[10:46.030 --> 10:49.030]  This stuff, I have said on this show
[10:49.030 --> 10:52.310]  that I'm skeptical of topicals and lotions and such.
[10:52.310 --> 10:54.030]  24 bucks.
[10:54.090 --> 10:57.370]  This was actually kicked down by the Grammy Gatsby to me,
[10:57.370 --> 10:59.790]  because I mentioned some shoulder pain.
[11:01.570 --> 11:03.090]  I had a guest over the other night
[11:03.090 --> 11:06.250]  who looked like hell when they were sitting at the table,
[11:06.250 --> 11:07.770]  didn't look like they felt good.
[11:07.770 --> 11:08.610]  And I was like, what's up?
[11:08.610 --> 11:09.770]  And they said, neck hurts.
[11:09.770 --> 11:12.090]  And put some of this on my hands
[11:12.090 --> 11:13.510]  and rubbed their neck for about 10 minutes,
[11:13.510 --> 11:15.410]  and my hands were high.
[11:15.410 --> 11:18.410]  My hands felt balloony.
[11:18.410 --> 11:19.770]  I hate to quote Pink Floyd,
[11:19.770 --> 11:21.690]  but my hands felt just like two balloons
[11:21.710 --> 11:24.550]  after massaging a girl's neck with that stuff.
[11:24.550 --> 11:27.470]  Yeah, I can only imagine what that girl's neck felt like
[11:27.470 --> 11:28.350]  after I rubbed that.
[11:28.350 --> 11:29.190]  I bet she was chilling.
[11:29.190 --> 11:31.390]  Or she just slathered it all over her legs
[11:31.390 --> 11:33.830]  and then like, you know what I'm saying?
[11:33.830 --> 11:36.150]  And she was talking about, it's just one, that one hit.
[11:36.150 --> 11:37.830]  No, it wasn't that one hit.
[11:37.830 --> 11:40.670]  The person you shared it with, yeah, yeah.
[11:40.670 --> 11:42.630]  Adam shared some Colorado Cannabis
[11:42.630 --> 11:44.350]  that I grew with a lightweight,
[11:44.350 --> 11:47.190]  and that kind of wrecked their world.
[11:47.190 --> 11:48.030]  Yeah, that's funny.
[11:48.030 --> 11:49.530]  All right, I'm gonna get a little back into this article.
[11:49.530 --> 11:50.730]  We got high and got distracted.
[11:50.750 --> 11:52.390]  Shout out to the person that got a massage
[11:52.390 --> 11:54.590]  with the freaking Cannabis Arnica,
[11:54.590 --> 11:58.110]  peppermint, juniper, cannabis lotion from Apothicana.
[11:58.110 --> 12:00.530]  Shout out, huge shout out to Grimey Gatsby.
[12:01.590 --> 12:02.510]  You guys don't even know.
[12:02.510 --> 12:04.030]  He's behind the scenes working shit,
[12:04.030 --> 12:05.390]  and you don't even know it.
[12:06.570 --> 12:07.990]  This article continues to say,
[12:07.990 --> 12:10.550]  so how did Griego land at these figures,
[12:10.550 --> 12:12.650]  especially given the state of Colorado's restrictions
[12:12.650 --> 12:15.350]  on tracking recreational customers' information?
[12:15.350 --> 12:16.190]  Ooh.
[12:17.390 --> 12:18.710]  We keep seeing these statistics,
[12:18.730 --> 12:21.650]  and that's a question I've raised twice now, once,
[12:21.650 --> 12:23.530]  and this is the second time somebody's raised it for me.
[12:23.530 --> 12:24.370]  Go for it.
[12:24.370 --> 12:25.730]  But you've already explained it
[12:25.730 --> 12:28.450]  where they're not tracking your name so much
[12:28.450 --> 12:32.610]  as they're just tracking your purchase, you know?
[12:32.610 --> 12:33.530]  He comments on it.
[12:33.530 --> 12:36.010]  So he says, we have a media group that we hired on,
[12:36.010 --> 12:37.810]  and they monitor all of our social media
[12:37.810 --> 12:40.570]  and Google Analytics, and we've paid close attention
[12:40.570 --> 12:42.690]  to the progression of people searching on PCs
[12:42.690 --> 12:45.050]  and mobile devices, Griego said.
[12:45.050 --> 12:47.370]  A lot of these numbers come from inside the store.
[12:47.370 --> 12:49.910]  Everyone has to show ID, and we check IDs twice,
[12:49.910 --> 12:52.790]  once in reception and again in the dispensing area.
[12:52.790 --> 12:54.470]  Plus, our bud tenders are always making
[12:54.470 --> 12:57.510]  friendly conversation, asking people where they're from.
[12:57.510 --> 13:00.030]  Sure, 80% is Griego's educated guess,
[13:00.030 --> 13:02.470]  but while he knows he sees traffic locally
[13:02.470 --> 13:06.230]  as well as from nearby weedless Colorado towns,
[13:06.230 --> 13:09.390]  Colorado Springs, Walsenburg, Trinidad, and La Junta,
[13:09.390 --> 13:12.430]  he said, he says definitively that he sees
[13:12.430 --> 13:14.650]  more Texans than anybody else.
[13:15.710 --> 13:17.230]  That's a big state, though.
[13:17.990 --> 13:19.370]  Our bro Kevin works at a shop, he's not here tonight,
[13:19.370 --> 13:21.810]  but he works at a dispensary, and he says
[13:21.810 --> 13:24.010]  it's a lot of Texans, yeah.
[13:24.010 --> 13:25.930]  Not surprisingly, the out of state customers
[13:25.930 --> 13:28.530]  are also spending more than the Coloradans, he said.
[13:30.110 --> 13:31.690]  I wanna know what you guys are paying for herb.
[13:31.690 --> 13:33.690]  You might have, we did this on my Facebook page
[13:33.690 --> 13:35.530]  on the iReed Genetics, I wanna know what you guys
[13:35.530 --> 13:37.290]  are paying herb in your location.
[13:37.290 --> 13:40.450]  Tweet me at iGrowCulture, let me know,
[13:40.450 --> 13:42.610]  give me a good, don't tell me exactly where you are,
[13:42.610 --> 13:43.770]  but just let me know what state you're in,
[13:43.770 --> 13:45.930]  maybe what part of that state, and let me know
[13:45.990 --> 13:48.390]  what good high-grade herb or whatever herb is available.
[13:48.390 --> 13:50.350]  Let me know what it costs.
[13:50.350 --> 13:55.050]  I'll tell you in Colorado, I don't go to the shops, dude.
[13:55.050 --> 13:57.190]  Do you know what an ounce, Kevin knows what an ounce,
[13:57.190 --> 14:00.030]  actually we had a friend, I think she said it was 4.60?
[14:00.030 --> 14:02.390]  That, yeah, recreational, that's right,
[14:02.390 --> 14:04.310]  about the high end of price.
[14:04.310 --> 14:06.030]  As a caregiver, my patients.
[14:06.030 --> 14:08.230]  You can find them for 3.50 if you shopped around
[14:08.230 --> 14:11.710]  and it wasn't really like, I want this quality and this,
[14:11.710 --> 14:13.670]  you know, you can still find it cheaper,
[14:13.670 --> 14:15.750]  depending on where you wanna go.
[14:16.450 --> 14:17.290]  Recreational, that is.
[14:17.290 --> 14:19.130]  All right, so I wanna know what you guys are paying.
[14:19.130 --> 14:21.650]  On the street right now in Colorado,
[14:21.650 --> 14:23.330]  ounces, depending on what you want,
[14:23.330 --> 14:26.370]  you can find an ounce for $150, it's not the dank,
[14:26.370 --> 14:27.210]  it's not the chronic, maybe.
[14:27.210 --> 14:30.490]  So would you buy it for medical or $150?
[14:30.490 --> 14:32.730]  But for the fire, it's about 200 bucks,
[14:32.730 --> 14:35.370]  225 for a good dank ounce right now in Colorado.
[14:35.370 --> 14:37.750]  Just depends on, you know, if you're just random, dude,
[14:37.750 --> 14:38.590]  if you got the hookups that you're going for.
[14:38.590 --> 14:41.250]  I would rather go 50 bucks, believe me.
[14:41.250 --> 14:42.090]  Just so you can buy it.
[14:42.090 --> 14:43.410]  Go that extra 50 and get that dank,
[14:43.410 --> 14:44.570]  that top shelf kush.
[14:44.590 --> 14:47.990]  Yeah, if you gotta go to the dispensaries and get it,
[14:47.990 --> 14:50.630]  it's gonna run you close to $500 an ounce
[14:50.630 --> 14:53.950]  for that same 225, $200 ounce.
[14:53.950 --> 14:56.230]  Wow, all right.
[14:56.230 --> 14:59.070]  It makes sense, but, and I guess it's the Colorado people
[14:59.070 --> 15:01.750]  are getting that stuff that the caregivers are growing
[15:01.750 --> 15:03.230]  or their buddies with the caregiver grow
[15:03.230 --> 15:05.590]  or having some extra on or something.
[15:05.590 --> 15:07.990]  All that private kush is a little bit better
[15:07.990 --> 15:09.750]  than the shop weed, I think.
[15:09.750 --> 15:12.990]  It's harder for someone to get on with the caregiver,
[15:13.170 --> 15:16.090]  especially if you don't have a medical debilitating
[15:16.090 --> 15:20.490]  condition where, you know, I'm not medical
[15:20.490 --> 15:22.490]  because I'm in a wheelchair, that's for sure,
[15:22.490 --> 15:23.410]  or I have cancer.
[15:23.410 --> 15:25.110]  It's just knowing somebody that you trust
[15:25.110 --> 15:26.610]  and want to assign as your caregiver.
[15:26.610 --> 15:28.690]  So here's something we kind of skipped over, guys.
[15:28.690 --> 15:30.370]  We were talking about caregiver and stuff.
[15:30.370 --> 15:33.070]  When you get a, and now actually the word is now provider
[15:33.070 --> 15:34.090]  in Colorado.
[15:34.090 --> 15:35.890]  When you're, back in the day it was caregiver,
[15:35.890 --> 15:37.430]  but that sounds confusing.
[15:37.430 --> 15:39.710]  When you get your medical marijuana recommendation
[15:39.710 --> 15:41.210]  from a doctor, there is no license.
[15:41.230 --> 15:43.150]  It's a recommendation, it's not a prescription.
[15:43.150 --> 15:45.030]  They recommend that you use medical cannabis
[15:45.030 --> 15:46.510]  and they sign papers.
[15:46.510 --> 15:49.510]  And you send that paper into the Colorado State Registry
[15:49.510 --> 15:51.750]  and they send you back a card that is a registry card
[15:51.750 --> 15:53.790]  that says you are registered with the state of Colorado
[15:53.790 --> 15:55.590]  to use medical marijuana.
[15:55.590 --> 15:57.910]  When you fill out your paperwork, you are allowed to sign,
[15:57.910 --> 16:00.630]  designate a person that is called your provider,
[16:00.630 --> 16:02.270]  which used to be your caregiver.
[16:02.270 --> 16:05.630]  This person, the paperwork says they have to be responsible
[16:05.630 --> 16:09.910]  for something other than just procuring your cannabis.
[16:09.930 --> 16:12.690]  So you should drive them to their medical marijuana
[16:12.690 --> 16:13.610]  doctor's appointment.
[16:13.610 --> 16:15.610]  You should probably make them a kale smoothie
[16:15.610 --> 16:17.570]  and work on their fucking person.
[16:17.570 --> 16:19.090]  I said, fuck again, somebody tweet me
[16:19.090 --> 16:20.530]  and tell me to stop doing that.
[16:20.530 --> 16:22.250]  I'm trying, I got a note in front of me still,
[16:22.250 --> 16:23.170]  watch your mouth.
[16:24.470 --> 16:26.770]  So you make them a, you go sit, you spend time with them.
[16:26.770 --> 16:27.610]  You make them a shake.
[16:27.610 --> 16:29.210]  You try to deal with their overall wellbeing.
[16:29.210 --> 16:31.410]  And if you're a caregiver, I think sitting like you and I do
[16:31.410 --> 16:32.730]  we hang out, I'm not your caregiver,
[16:32.730 --> 16:33.730]  but when you're having a bad day,
[16:33.730 --> 16:34.950]  when something's driving you nuts.
[16:34.950 --> 16:37.210]  I got my red card the same day you renewed
[16:37.630 --> 16:39.950]  and you were there with a couple of my patients.
[16:39.950 --> 16:40.950]  Yeah, absolutely.
[16:40.950 --> 16:43.190]  And I hang out, you can tell that one of the guys
[16:43.190 --> 16:45.270]  is an older cat, he's a 60 year old guy
[16:45.270 --> 16:47.750]  and him and I, he's my bro, because like you come
[16:47.750 --> 16:49.230]  and sit on the table, sit at the table
[16:49.230 --> 16:50.910]  and you're having a bad day and we talk
[16:50.910 --> 16:52.470]  and you feel better about that.
[16:52.470 --> 16:55.310]  Some people that have AIDS, cancer, major shit,
[16:55.310 --> 16:56.390]  they don't have those people.
[16:56.390 --> 16:57.470]  They just need someone to talk to
[16:57.470 --> 16:58.870]  because a lot of people are afraid of them.
[16:58.870 --> 17:00.710]  Once you're sick, people abandon you
[17:00.710 --> 17:01.910]  or you just need extra.
[17:01.910 --> 17:02.990]  They gotta distance themselves.
[17:02.990 --> 17:04.190]  We need extra support.
[17:04.190 --> 17:05.230]  You need extra support.
[17:05.250 --> 17:07.590]  Even if those people are there, you can always use,
[17:07.590 --> 17:09.370]  I'm a young, energetic, youthful dude
[17:09.370 --> 17:10.210]  with a good attitude.
[17:10.210 --> 17:12.730]  I just spit right across the table at you, my bad.
[17:12.730 --> 17:16.130]  I apologize for that one, but I didn't say fuck about it.
[17:16.130 --> 17:16.970]  Till now.
[17:16.970 --> 17:18.410]  I just tweeted.
[17:18.410 --> 17:21.050]  So I think being a caregiver, that's part of it.
[17:21.050 --> 17:23.530]  Going in, I write down spiritual counseling
[17:23.530 --> 17:25.730]  on my, when they say, what else do you provide?
[17:25.730 --> 17:27.850]  I make smoothies and shakes for these guys.
[17:27.850 --> 17:28.850]  I drive them to their appointments
[17:28.850 --> 17:32.130]  and I provide spiritual counseling, just being your friend.
[17:32.130 --> 17:33.850]  But so the caregiver is a person
[17:33.850 --> 17:36.790]  that is responsible for providing your medicine.
[17:36.790 --> 17:39.670]  The actual Colorado law does say
[17:39.670 --> 17:42.770]  that they are allowed to charge you money
[17:42.770 --> 17:45.510]  to cover the cost of your labor
[17:45.510 --> 17:47.510]  and your lights and your expenses.
[17:47.510 --> 17:50.750]  But you're not supposed to profit off of caregivering,
[17:50.750 --> 17:51.910]  your caregiver-ship.
[17:51.910 --> 17:52.750]  I understand that.
[17:52.750 --> 17:53.670]  Your provider-ship.
[17:53.670 --> 17:56.710]  So yeah, so you can be a caregiver
[17:56.710 --> 17:57.630]  in the state of Colorado.
[17:57.630 --> 17:59.830]  All you have to do is decide that you wanna be a caregiver
[17:59.830 --> 18:00.830]  and learn how to grow
[18:00.850 --> 18:04.010]  and then find somebody that trusts you enough
[18:04.010 --> 18:06.230]  and then work out something with them.
[18:07.890 --> 18:09.130]  The dispensaries, I don't think,
[18:09.130 --> 18:11.830]  or the centers don't give you a good deal.
[18:11.830 --> 18:14.350]  They just give you a little bit of a discount.
[18:14.350 --> 18:16.810]  My guys, they're people that I'm responsible for.
[18:16.810 --> 18:18.770]  Right now, there are four people
[18:18.770 --> 18:20.570]  and I know pretty much exactly how much.
[18:20.570 --> 18:22.130]  I can predict when they need medicine.
[18:22.130 --> 18:23.490]  I'll be sitting around one night and go,
[18:23.490 --> 18:26.130]  oh, it's about time for patient A to give me a call tomorrow
[18:26.130 --> 18:27.810]  and I'll put them a little package together
[18:27.810 --> 18:29.330]  because I know what he needs and when he needs it.
[18:29.350 --> 18:32.310]  Not only that, but that way they kind of have
[18:32.310 --> 18:37.310]  more of a specific and exactly what they need.
[18:37.590 --> 18:39.870]  You know, high CBD, high THC.
[18:39.870 --> 18:41.950]  Exactly, I grow that Tora Bora cut.
[18:41.950 --> 18:43.310]  Exactly.
[18:43.310 --> 18:45.550]  The night nurse was bred for a specific person.
[18:45.550 --> 18:48.510]  His two favorite strains are Grateful Dog and Tora Bora
[18:48.510 --> 18:50.590]  and I bred them together basically
[18:50.590 --> 18:52.910]  to make the perfect medicine for one of my patients.
[18:52.910 --> 18:53.750]  Absolutely, man.
[18:53.750 --> 18:54.750]  I went that far for this guy.
[18:54.750 --> 18:56.030]  Plus, I know it's gonna be a killer strain,
[18:56.030 --> 18:58.150]  but I mean, he inspired that strain.
[18:58.970 --> 19:01.250]  You're probably not gonna go wrong with it
[19:01.250 --> 19:03.130]  and even if you do, you know, it's a test.
[19:03.130 --> 19:04.290]  It's all an experiment.
[19:04.290 --> 19:05.130]  It's sitting there on the table
[19:05.130 --> 19:06.610]  if you wanna give that thing a little smell.
[19:06.610 --> 19:07.850]  Yeah, I've smelled it.
[19:07.850 --> 19:09.330]  It's fantastic.
[19:09.330 --> 19:10.170]  Well, thank you.
[19:10.170 --> 19:11.250]  That's the night nurse.
[19:11.250 --> 19:13.290]  It's definitely frosty.
[19:13.290 --> 19:15.890]  DNA Genetics lets me use their Tora Bora.
[19:15.890 --> 19:17.290]  They gave me permission to breed with it.
[19:17.290 --> 19:19.710]  I've got their award-winning cut.
[19:19.710 --> 19:23.090]  They let me use that to breed to the Grateful Dog
[19:23.090 --> 19:25.890]  and it came out pretty stanky.
[19:25.890 --> 19:27.050]  It smells well.
[19:27.070 --> 19:28.390]  I'm gonna run a bunch of testers
[19:28.390 --> 19:30.630]  and maybe one day we'll put that to market.
[19:30.630 --> 19:31.470]  I definitely like the taste of it.
[19:31.470 --> 19:34.150]  You can find that at naturesgreenremedies.com.
[19:34.150 --> 19:36.390]  Because I'm more of the indica smoker
[19:36.390 --> 19:38.790]  whereas you're more of the sativa guy.
[19:38.790 --> 19:41.790]  What's weird about me, I like indica flowers.
[19:41.790 --> 19:42.710]  If I'm gonna smoke a joint,
[19:42.710 --> 19:44.830]  I want it to make me sit down and chill out.
[19:44.830 --> 19:45.950]  And like, well, I just want,
[19:45.950 --> 19:48.950]  a joint seems more like sitting in a hammock
[19:48.950 --> 19:50.810]  with my feet up with the little dreadlock girl
[19:50.810 --> 19:53.750]  cuddled up next to me and some Grateful Dead on the radio
[19:53.750 --> 19:54.750]  and a nice breeze.
[19:54.750 --> 19:55.910]  That's smoking a joint.
[19:56.910 --> 19:58.490]  Dabs are like taking shots.
[19:58.490 --> 19:59.410]  I don't drink alcohol,
[19:59.410 --> 20:00.850]  but it reminds me of when I used to drink
[20:00.850 --> 20:02.490]  Jägermeister or tequila.
[20:02.490 --> 20:05.250]  It's more energetic.
[20:05.250 --> 20:06.930]  It makes my head spin a little bit more.
[20:06.930 --> 20:08.730]  I don't relax well after dabs.
[20:08.730 --> 20:09.890]  It makes me want to do shit
[20:09.890 --> 20:12.450]  unless I take a half gram dab and want to sit down.
[20:12.450 --> 20:13.410]  Oh my goodness.
[20:13.410 --> 20:14.250]  Yeah, yeah.
[20:14.250 --> 20:15.490]  We won't do that tonight on the show.
[20:15.490 --> 20:17.210]  We will do a large dab.
[20:17.210 --> 20:18.430]  It's almost time.
[20:19.490 --> 20:21.850]  The large dab thing is almost coming to an end.
[20:21.850 --> 20:23.850]  I don't feel as good about it as I used to.
[20:23.850 --> 20:25.830]  I'm getting older, I guess.
[20:26.650 --> 20:28.170]  Your lungs have so many inhales and exhales
[20:28.170 --> 20:30.210]  and I'm assuming by doing a half gram dab,
[20:30.210 --> 20:34.050]  I'm probably using up multiple inhale and exhales
[20:34.050 --> 20:35.210]  for each dab.
[20:35.210 --> 20:36.970]  And I'd like to live a little bit longer
[20:36.970 --> 20:38.630]  than I wanted to when I was a kid.
[20:38.630 --> 20:41.530]  I didn't realize one day I was gonna fall over and die.
[20:41.530 --> 20:43.750]  So we may do a grand finale.
[20:43.750 --> 20:46.810]  We may do like a gram dab or a two gram dab or something.
[20:46.810 --> 20:47.890]  Episode 100.
[20:47.890 --> 20:49.730]  Episode, no, that's a long time.
[20:49.730 --> 20:51.530]  Maybe like 50 or something.
[20:51.530 --> 20:52.690]  For the stars, brother.
[20:52.690 --> 20:53.530]  For the stars.
[20:53.530 --> 20:54.350]  I just want to do it.
[20:54.370 --> 20:56.530]  Hopefully we can retire the super large dab thing.
[20:56.530 --> 20:58.490]  We can put the dab challenges to a rest
[20:58.490 --> 20:59.810]  and say, hey, we're all alive.
[20:59.810 --> 21:02.410]  We can do the life challenge after that.
[21:03.690 --> 21:06.130]  So we're way off topic on this news thing.
[21:06.130 --> 21:07.010]  Weed's expensive.
[21:07.010 --> 21:09.050]  It could be 200, 150 an ounce,
[21:09.050 --> 21:11.790]  but these shops are selling it for 500 an ounce,
[21:11.790 --> 21:12.930]  close enough.
[21:12.930 --> 21:15.590]  You think weed is expensive where you live.
[21:15.590 --> 21:16.690]  Even though it's legal here,
[21:16.690 --> 21:19.010]  it's not the cheapest for recreational use.
[21:19.010 --> 21:21.050]  Yeah, but it's available.
[21:21.050 --> 21:22.970]  Yeah, it's vastly available
[21:22.990 --> 21:24.510]  between the hours of eight and eight.
[21:24.510 --> 21:25.590]  Here's a random question.
[21:25.590 --> 21:28.830]  You're from a state where cannabis was hard to get.
[21:28.830 --> 21:30.750]  You've told me stories about waiting on your dude
[21:30.750 --> 21:31.670]  for hours and hours.
[21:31.670 --> 21:32.750]  It's not that it was hard to get.
[21:32.750 --> 21:36.210]  It's just that everybody is too busy.
[21:36.210 --> 21:38.070]  There's other drugs that are more important
[21:38.070 --> 21:40.390]  than your $10 dime bag.
[21:40.390 --> 21:41.670]  Okay, yeah, it's Florida.
[21:41.670 --> 21:43.430]  So you guys could imagine what kind of
[21:43.430 --> 21:44.270]  San Diego drugs you're doing.
[21:44.270 --> 21:45.090]  Florida wasn't that hard.
[21:45.090 --> 21:45.930]  I grew up there.
[21:45.930 --> 21:47.990]  So it was, but when I moved back to Tennessee.
[21:47.990 --> 21:50.990]  So would you rather have, whoa,
[21:51.010 --> 21:53.030]  the internet just, it's refreshing multiple times
[21:53.030 --> 21:53.870]  and freaking me out,
[21:53.870 --> 21:55.930]  but it went right back to where it was.
[21:55.930 --> 21:57.170]  The music didn't cut out, so that's cool.
[21:57.170 --> 21:58.410]  Would you rather have,
[21:59.610 --> 22:02.690]  so street weed is cheaper, a little bit cheaper.
[22:02.690 --> 22:06.090]  I'm gonna say 30 bucks an eighth on the street.
[22:06.090 --> 22:07.770]  How much is an eighth of weed at the dispensary
[22:07.770 --> 22:08.810]  where you would shop?
[22:09.650 --> 22:11.010]  For recreational?
[22:12.010 --> 22:13.650]  That you can go get, your med weed.
[22:13.650 --> 22:16.210]  Oh, 30 at my shop.
[22:16.210 --> 22:17.050]  Would you rather-
[22:17.050 --> 22:18.730]  They have deals every fourth and the 20th month.
[22:18.730 --> 22:20.570]  And how much is it rec?
[22:21.110 --> 22:22.590]  Recreational, sorry.
[22:22.590 --> 22:23.790]  60 bucks an eighth.
[22:23.790 --> 22:24.630]  Holy crap.
[22:24.630 --> 22:27.590]  So 55 to 60, just depending on which store.
[22:27.590 --> 22:30.990]  Would you rather have the convenience of going to the store
[22:30.990 --> 22:32.390]  and just paying the extra money?
[22:32.390 --> 22:34.230]  Or would you rather sit there and wait for some
[22:34.230 --> 22:35.830]  high ass dude to show up with a sack
[22:35.830 --> 22:36.670]  that's probably light?
[22:36.670 --> 22:41.110]  If I go buy a gram or a, just a joint,
[22:41.110 --> 22:42.910]  from a pre-roll or something like that,
[22:42.910 --> 22:46.070]  we're gonna get high and it was eight bucks or 10 bucks.
[22:46.070 --> 22:46.910]  You know what I'm saying?
[22:46.910 --> 22:48.230]  And I could go out there,
[22:48.230 --> 22:50.550]  it costs you a little bit of gas because it's here.
[22:51.490 --> 22:54.370]  But some places have it, you know,
[22:54.370 --> 22:55.210]  closer to them.
[22:55.210 --> 22:56.050]  A little closer, yeah.
[22:56.050 --> 22:56.870]  Yeah, you know, if I lived out there,
[22:56.870 --> 22:58.010]  it'd be a different story.
[22:58.010 --> 23:00.770]  But you could go buy a joint, you know?
[23:00.770 --> 23:02.450]  I mean, it's as simple as that.
[23:03.490 --> 23:06.490]  And that to me, I'm not gonna go out there and do it
[23:06.490 --> 23:10.370]  just because I, you move here, you get kind of picky.
[23:10.370 --> 23:11.530]  Yeah, yeah.
[23:11.530 --> 23:14.090]  Everybody in Colorado's a damn weed snob now.
[23:14.090 --> 23:14.970]  Or all kind of sewers.
[23:14.970 --> 23:16.530]  I only smoke OG Kush.
[23:16.530 --> 23:18.130]  I was already a weed snob before I moved here.
[23:18.130 --> 23:19.970]  I only smoked Girl Scout cookies.
[23:20.310 --> 23:21.390]  People would give me weed and I'd be like,
[23:21.390 --> 23:23.190]  did you flush this?
[23:23.190 --> 23:24.190]  Do you even flush?
[23:24.190 --> 23:25.790]  Hashtag do you even flush, bro?
[23:27.950 --> 23:28.930]  Yeah, flush your weed.
[23:28.930 --> 23:30.150]  We'll talk about that in the future.
[23:30.150 --> 23:31.230]  Flush your weed, dude.
[23:31.230 --> 23:32.070]  It's easy.
[23:32.070 --> 23:32.890]  It's one of the easiest.
[23:32.890 --> 23:33.730]  It's almost free.
[23:33.730 --> 23:36.070]  And it's one of the easiest things you can do.
[23:36.070 --> 23:37.030]  Just flush your weed.
[23:37.030 --> 23:38.310]  It'll help out so much.
[23:38.310 --> 23:39.150]  And cure.
[23:39.150 --> 23:39.970]  And cure.
[23:39.970 --> 23:40.810]  Well, that's a whole,
[23:40.810 --> 23:43.030]  I can talk for hours about curing weed.
[23:43.030 --> 23:44.150]  Maybe I will one day.
[23:44.150 --> 23:45.830]  But those are the two things back East
[23:45.830 --> 23:47.110]  that people are like, what?
[23:47.110 --> 23:48.430]  That's what a lot of people are failing on.
[23:48.430 --> 23:49.790]  I see a lot of Facebook posts about,
[23:50.610 --> 23:52.090]  does anybody in Colorado know how to cure weed?
[23:52.090 --> 23:52.930]  Yes, I do.
[23:52.930 --> 23:54.610]  And I'll share it.
[23:54.610 --> 23:55.450]  I will.
[23:55.450 --> 23:56.270]  It's different here.
[23:56.270 --> 23:57.290]  It's dry here.
[23:57.290 --> 23:59.010]  So you either need to build a humid room
[23:59.010 --> 24:00.050]  and control your humidity.
[24:00.050 --> 24:01.130]  All right, I'm just ranting.
[24:01.130 --> 24:02.090]  I'm gonna get back to the article.
[24:02.090 --> 24:03.070]  Because I said I had a lot of news.
[24:03.070 --> 24:05.210]  And at this rate, we're not gonna get a lot of news in.
[24:05.210 --> 24:06.050]  What news story?
[24:06.050 --> 24:06.870]  It's cool.
[24:06.870 --> 24:07.710]  It's a podcast, man.
[24:07.710 --> 24:09.010]  It's going the way it should.
[24:09.010 --> 24:10.170]  These out of state consumers,
[24:10.170 --> 24:11.630]  because remember, we're talking about people
[24:11.630 --> 24:12.470]  from out of state.
[24:12.470 --> 24:13.570]  That's how far it's been.
[24:13.570 --> 24:14.930]  These out of state consumers are spending
[24:14.930 --> 24:16.610]  much more than locals, Grego said.
[24:16.610 --> 24:18.970]  They're spending about twice as much as locals.
[24:18.990 --> 24:21.790]  About 120 to $140.
[24:21.790 --> 24:23.830]  Edibles are the most popular with these people.
[24:23.830 --> 24:25.990]  Out of state consumers can buy up to seven grams
[24:25.990 --> 24:26.830]  of cannabis total.
[24:26.830 --> 24:29.490]  So you see them buy one to two grams of bud
[24:29.490 --> 24:33.470]  and the rest of their allotment made up of edible products.
[24:33.470 --> 24:35.070]  I'm not sure.
[24:35.070 --> 24:36.430]  I am not up to date with that rule.
[24:36.430 --> 24:38.590]  We're gonna have to look that up in the future here
[24:38.590 --> 24:39.790]  and talk about that.
[24:39.790 --> 24:41.270]  What is your edible?
[24:43.870 --> 24:45.010]  Medical?
[24:45.010 --> 24:47.990]  They don't really distinguish between the two.
[24:48.010 --> 24:49.410]  No, no, I'm saying your edibles for,
[24:49.410 --> 24:51.090]  this is for recreational purposes
[24:51.090 --> 24:52.290]  because it's out of staters.
[24:52.290 --> 24:54.250]  How much does my edible count as?
[24:55.210 --> 24:57.210]  I thought you and Kevin already went over this
[24:57.210 --> 25:01.210]  where it was gonna be weighed by the metric gram
[25:01.210 --> 25:02.210]  or whatever, you know?
[25:02.210 --> 25:03.270]  I mean.
[25:03.270 --> 25:04.110]  I don't remember that.
[25:04.110 --> 25:04.930]  We're gonna have to Google that.
[25:04.930 --> 25:05.850]  We'll find that out for you guys.
[25:05.850 --> 25:06.810]  Remind me to check that out
[25:06.810 --> 25:08.450]  and we'll put that on a future episode.
[25:08.450 --> 25:10.170]  Of course, I just saw fish this weekend
[25:10.170 --> 25:11.530]  after your, while you're listening to this.
[25:11.530 --> 25:12.890]  So I'm forgetful.
[25:12.890 --> 25:14.810]  I'm gonna need some pep talks.
[25:14.810 --> 25:15.650]  This is remind me.
[25:15.650 --> 25:16.470]  Forgetful in the future.
[25:16.470 --> 25:17.310]  Remind me.
[25:17.370 --> 25:20.010]  Yeah, we're gonna get back to the future.
[25:20.010 --> 25:21.690]  Since it's illegal to cross state boundaries
[25:21.690 --> 25:23.970]  with legally purchased Colorado marijuana,
[25:23.970 --> 25:26.610]  does Griego and his staff inform these consumers,
[25:26.610 --> 25:30.130]  says customer, sorry, about that very serious state law?
[25:30.130 --> 25:32.370]  And here's where I have the problem.
[25:32.370 --> 25:35.130]  This person that I got to try that cream
[25:35.130 --> 25:38.250]  was very vocal inside the store
[25:38.250 --> 25:41.130]  and asking where she could take Hearsaid products
[25:41.130 --> 25:43.010]  since it was high in CBD,
[25:43.010 --> 25:45.890]  just product in general.
[25:45.910 --> 25:49.110]  And he, after informing him,
[25:49.110 --> 25:51.590]  after informing her three times,
[25:51.590 --> 25:53.030]  he kind of got like, hey,
[25:53.030 --> 25:57.750]  can we stop saying anything about taking it
[25:57.750 --> 25:58.910]  where you're not supposed to?
[25:58.910 --> 25:59.950]  I think we've already said it.
[25:59.950 --> 26:01.510]  So guys, when you come to Colorado,
[26:01.510 --> 26:04.110]  what Adam's kind of alluding to is have some class,
[26:04.110 --> 26:05.950]  be careful what you say in the dispensaries.
[26:05.950 --> 26:07.310]  No, the answer is no.
[26:07.310 --> 26:09.070]  When you're thinking, can I put this in my car
[26:09.070 --> 26:10.470]  and drive back to Texas?
[26:10.470 --> 26:11.310]  No.
[26:11.310 --> 26:14.150]  Can I put this in my suitcase and fly back to California?
[26:14.170 --> 26:16.130]  Maybe, maybe.
[26:16.130 --> 26:17.250]  You're not allowed to take it.
[26:17.250 --> 26:19.170]  There's amnesty boxes in the airport.
[26:19.170 --> 26:22.250]  Even there is ways to pack it.
[26:22.250 --> 26:24.370]  And if you're a medical marijuana patient in California
[26:24.370 --> 26:25.670]  and you're flying, figure that one out for yourself.
[26:25.670 --> 26:27.170]  I'm not gonna encourage that, but you're not supposed to.
[26:27.170 --> 26:28.850]  I'm gonna leave all the medical states out of that.
[26:28.850 --> 26:31.490]  But the, no, you're not supposed to leave Colorado
[26:31.490 --> 26:33.370]  with Colorado marijuana products.
[26:33.370 --> 26:34.570]  You're really not supposed to do that.
[26:34.570 --> 26:35.810]  I shouldn't encourage it in any way.
[26:35.810 --> 26:37.050]  Even if you're going to California,
[26:37.050 --> 26:38.170]  if you're going to fucking Washington,
[26:38.170 --> 26:39.010]  it's legal.
[26:39.010 --> 26:39.850]  Don't do it.
[26:39.850 --> 26:41.130]  There is forms and laws and procedures
[26:41.130 --> 26:43.970]  because I've seen people, you know, for cups bring.
[26:44.870 --> 26:48.030]  Substantial amounts just in their backpacks, you know?
[26:48.030 --> 26:51.550]  So there is forms and procedures go through that
[26:51.550 --> 26:53.070]  if you really want to do it,
[26:53.070 --> 26:54.210]  but you're not going to be like,
[26:54.210 --> 26:56.550]  can I bring my quarter home to Kentucky?
[26:56.550 --> 26:57.390]  No.
[26:57.390 --> 26:58.210]  So you shop at dispensaries.
[26:58.210 --> 26:59.590]  This guy says, when people come in,
[26:59.590 --> 27:01.430]  we're all about safety and state compliance.
[27:01.430 --> 27:04.230]  And we make sure that the out-of-state consumers are aware
[27:06.110 --> 27:07.830]  that they're, he says that,
[27:07.830 --> 27:12.590]  are aware that they're purchasing the, okay.
[27:12.650 --> 27:13.890]  This is written weird,
[27:13.890 --> 27:16.890]  but it says there is for in-state consumption only.
[27:16.890 --> 27:19.210]  We also remind them that they can't do it in public.
[27:19.210 --> 27:20.030]  Is that true?
[27:20.030 --> 27:21.490]  Do the shops remind you that stuff when you're there?
[27:21.490 --> 27:23.190]  Cause you have an out-of-state ID.
[27:25.010 --> 27:26.850]  A few of them have, not all of them.
[27:28.050 --> 27:29.890]  It just really depends on how busy, you know,
[27:29.890 --> 27:30.890]  if they're having a slow day,
[27:30.890 --> 27:32.650]  they'll chat you up a little bit,
[27:32.650 --> 27:34.490]  but if there's 10 people in the waiting room,
[27:34.490 --> 27:37.350]  they're not, they're not informing you of nothing.
[27:37.350 --> 27:39.470]  They're what you, what you want.
[27:39.470 --> 27:40.450]  Okay.
[27:40.450 --> 27:41.290]  How much?
[27:41.290 --> 27:42.370]  Okay.
[27:43.150 --> 27:43.990]  You can buy this much.
[27:43.990 --> 27:45.950]  If you want to buy this much, that's what it really is.
[27:45.950 --> 27:47.790]  And most of the recreational shops,
[27:47.790 --> 27:52.510]  the pre-rolls are actually just shake and bullshit
[27:52.510 --> 27:53.390]  and you don't want it.
[27:53.390 --> 27:57.190]  So I don't know if bullshit counts on the cuss jar.
[27:57.190 --> 27:58.150]  I just said bullshit.
[27:58.150 --> 27:59.470]  Does that count in the cuss jar?
[27:59.470 --> 28:00.310]  Is that fair?
[28:00.310 --> 28:01.130]  It's not the F word.
[28:01.130 --> 28:02.710]  Hey, check out the can of sewer in this picture.
[28:02.710 --> 28:06.710]  They have, I'm not, I don't endorse any dispensary.
[28:06.710 --> 28:07.950]  Honestly, I'm not paid.
[28:07.950 --> 28:09.630]  I'm not sponsored by any dispensary.
[28:09.630 --> 28:11.470]  I don't shop at most dispensaries.
[28:11.490 --> 28:12.310]  And I hate that.
[28:12.310 --> 28:15.770]  But this picture, the picture of the can of sewer here
[28:15.770 --> 28:18.130]  has a picture of their, the got a window cut out
[28:18.130 --> 28:20.150]  and you can see into their grow room.
[28:20.150 --> 28:22.770]  So if you are from another state
[28:22.770 --> 28:24.850]  and you want to see a pretty stylish looking grow room,
[28:24.850 --> 28:25.690]  check that out.
[28:25.690 --> 28:27.690]  I don't know anything about their product.
[28:27.690 --> 28:28.530]  Many people here.
[28:28.530 --> 28:29.850]  It looks cool in this picture.
[28:29.850 --> 28:31.210]  That is very stylish.
[28:31.210 --> 28:32.810]  I don't, like I said,
[28:32.810 --> 28:34.130]  I don't know what their product is like.
[28:34.130 --> 28:36.850]  If you go in there and they sell you, hey, I apologize.
[28:36.870 --> 28:37.690]  So,
[28:40.870 --> 28:42.950]  somebody looks like I may be right about that.
[28:42.950 --> 28:44.030]  You can say that on my show.
[28:44.030 --> 28:45.510]  You're allowed to have an opinion, bro.
[28:45.510 --> 28:46.550]  No, no, no.
[28:46.550 --> 28:47.390]  I just.
[28:47.390 --> 28:48.510]  Out of five stars, how many?
[28:48.510 --> 28:49.550]  I've never been there.
[28:49.550 --> 28:50.390]  Okay.
[28:50.390 --> 28:51.750]  So I don't want to give any rating.
[28:51.750 --> 28:52.590]  All right.
[28:52.590 --> 28:53.410]  I've just heard stories.
[28:53.410 --> 28:54.250]  All right.
[28:54.250 --> 28:55.510]  Yeah, I've heard a lot of stories as well
[28:55.510 --> 28:56.990]  from about a lot of the shops here.
[28:56.990 --> 28:58.430]  I'm a med patient.
[28:58.430 --> 29:00.590]  80% of our customers are coming from out of state.
[29:00.590 --> 29:01.710]  So that's a good article there.
[29:01.710 --> 29:02.770]  I thought you guys would be interested.
[29:02.770 --> 29:04.990]  Let's click over back to the recording
[29:05.010 --> 29:07.250]  and see how many hours we've gone.
[29:07.250 --> 29:08.170]  We're at 30 minutes here.
[29:08.170 --> 29:11.370]  We're going to squeeze in some more stuff, you guys.
[29:11.370 --> 29:14.210]  I sent an email to Jody Emery asking if I'm allowed
[29:14.210 --> 29:17.250]  to play parts of a Mark Emery video on a podcast.
[29:17.250 --> 29:19.810]  And if I am, I plan to play a little bit
[29:19.810 --> 29:21.750]  of Mark's speech that he gave recently
[29:21.750 --> 29:23.870]  after he was released from federal prison.
[29:23.870 --> 29:24.950]  So I look forward to doing that.
[29:24.950 --> 29:25.790]  I need a drink.
[29:25.790 --> 29:26.610]  Excuse me.
[29:26.610 --> 29:27.450]  One second.
[29:27.450 --> 29:28.290]  Adam, say something.
[29:28.290 --> 29:29.830]  Yeah, I watched this and actually linked it to him.
[29:29.830 --> 29:32.790]  It was a powerful, motivating speech.
[29:32.790 --> 29:34.290]  He is on the ball.
[29:35.290 --> 29:38.870]  And if he does get the permission to do it,
[29:39.830 --> 29:40.810]  I won't ruin it for you.
[29:40.810 --> 29:43.170]  But everybody should watch it.
[29:43.170 --> 29:45.510]  And if it doesn't inspire you to get up off your feet.
[29:45.510 --> 29:47.610]  You want to take a risk and just play some of it?
[29:47.610 --> 29:51.730]  We can, or we can just talk kind of what it's about.
[29:51.730 --> 29:53.230]  I don't really want to talk what it's about.
[29:53.230 --> 29:55.310]  I like being innovative.
[29:55.310 --> 29:57.530]  You know, the audio, I don't think we'll be in trouble for.
[29:57.530 --> 29:58.370]  I really don't.
[29:58.370 --> 29:59.190]  As long as we don't play video or something.
[29:59.190 --> 30:00.030]  It's on YouTube.
[30:00.030 --> 30:00.850]  You know what I'm saying?
[30:01.710 --> 30:03.390]  Let's click over here and pause the music.
[30:03.390 --> 30:04.670]  And then I think I'm going to play a little bit
[30:04.670 --> 30:05.510]  of this video.
[30:05.510 --> 30:08.050]  I wasn't prepared to do it, but we're talking about it.
[30:08.050 --> 30:10.130]  And it seems like the thing to do.
[30:10.130 --> 30:11.890]  If you kind of play towards the end of it,
[30:11.890 --> 30:14.050]  it would kind of relay the message more of it.
[30:14.050 --> 30:16.170]  Unless you want to play the whole video later on.
[30:16.170 --> 30:18.290]  How about I'll play a couple of intro seconds
[30:18.290 --> 30:19.490]  when he takes the mic.
[30:19.490 --> 30:20.770]  He was introduced at one point
[30:20.770 --> 30:23.190]  and he brought his friend back on stage to.
[30:23.190 --> 30:24.370]  That's a good part.
[30:24.370 --> 30:25.310]  He gets introduced.
[30:25.310 --> 30:27.690]  Mark Emery is introduced by somebody else.
[30:27.690 --> 30:30.210]  Mark Emery comes on stage and gives thanks to another friend
[30:30.290 --> 30:31.250]  and hands the mic to him.
[30:31.250 --> 30:34.190]  That guy talks for about eight minutes.
[30:34.190 --> 30:36.130]  And then Mark Emery comes back on stage
[30:36.130 --> 30:39.010]  and starts his little, not little, his big speech.
[30:39.010 --> 30:40.770]  We'll start with, it's about 10 minutes
[30:40.770 --> 30:42.810]  and 25 seconds into the video.
[30:42.810 --> 30:43.730]  We'll start there.
[30:43.730 --> 30:45.530]  I'm going to give a shout out to the YouTube page
[30:45.530 --> 30:46.370]  that I'm playing it from.
[30:46.370 --> 30:47.290]  I'm trying to be polite here.
[30:47.290 --> 30:49.290]  These guys are, I asked for permission.
[30:49.290 --> 30:51.410]  I haven't gotten the email back saying yes or no yet,
[30:51.410 --> 30:52.950]  but they're busy.
[30:52.950 --> 30:53.970]  I feel like they'd let me do it.
[30:53.970 --> 30:54.870]  And it's Jodi Emery.
[30:54.870 --> 30:55.710]  She's cool.
[30:55.710 --> 30:56.530]  Why wouldn't she want Mark's.
[30:56.530 --> 30:57.370]  Preach the word.
[30:57.370 --> 31:00.110]  Yeah, and it's coming from Pot TV on YouTube.
[31:00.830 --> 31:03.150]  It's on Cannabis Culture's website.
[31:03.150 --> 31:04.270]  Big shout out to all those guys.
[31:04.270 --> 31:05.590]  So please.
[31:05.590 --> 31:06.670]  I subscribe to you.
[31:06.670 --> 31:07.950]  So I beg for your forgiveness
[31:07.950 --> 31:09.170]  if I wasn't supposed to do this,
[31:09.170 --> 31:11.790]  but I'm sure you'd want this message out.
[31:11.790 --> 31:13.190]  And then we'll play a few seconds of it.
[31:13.190 --> 31:15.590]  And then we'll find out if we can play a lot of it.
[31:15.590 --> 31:16.550]  And if we can play a bunch,
[31:16.550 --> 31:18.990]  we'll go ahead and play a couple of minutes of it
[31:18.990 --> 31:19.830]  for everyone.
[31:19.830 --> 31:20.790]  Yeah.
[31:20.790 --> 31:21.710]  Guys, I'm going to take a drink.
[31:21.710 --> 31:22.530]  We'll take some dabs.
[31:22.530 --> 31:25.150]  I'll start off this Mark Emery video.
[31:25.150 --> 31:26.590]  This was kind of a weird transition here
[31:26.590 --> 31:27.550]  that randomly happened.
[31:27.550 --> 31:29.390]  This is Mark Emery right after he,
[31:29.390 --> 31:31.430]  I think he's like 48 hours out of prison
[31:31.430 --> 31:32.270]  when he did this.
[31:32.270 --> 31:33.630]  Absolutely.
[31:33.630 --> 31:35.190]  48, something like that he said.
[31:35.190 --> 31:36.230]  So here it goes.
[31:36.230 --> 31:37.070]  I'm going to click play
[31:37.070 --> 31:39.030]  and I will have to adjust the sound while it goes on.
[31:39.030 --> 31:39.870]  I apologize.
[31:39.870 --> 31:40.710]  We'll figure it out on the fly.
[31:40.710 --> 31:42.550]  It's fun to be me.
[31:42.550 --> 31:44.750]  I even said that while I was in prison
[31:44.750 --> 31:47.110]  because doing something,
[31:47.110 --> 31:48.710]  let's almost use the word noble,
[31:48.710 --> 31:50.710]  doing something on principle,
[31:50.710 --> 31:53.750]  giving a good chunk of your life in sacrifice,
[31:53.750 --> 31:55.190]  I guess for principle,
[31:55.190 --> 31:57.910]  even in prison was highly regarded.
[31:57.910 --> 32:00.230]  In the four and a half years I was in prison,
[32:00.230 --> 32:02.750]  I really never heard an unkind word spoken to me
[32:02.750 --> 32:03.870]  by any inmate.
[32:03.870 --> 32:05.710]  And I was in a medium security prison
[32:05.710 --> 32:06.550]  for almost all of that.
[32:06.550 --> 32:08.870]  And a lot of these people are serving life imprisonment
[32:08.870 --> 32:09.830]  without parole.
[32:09.830 --> 32:11.670]  They've come down from the penitentiary.
[32:11.670 --> 32:13.210]  They're covered in tattoos.
[32:13.210 --> 32:15.750]  They're bad-ass dudes, a lot of them,
[32:15.750 --> 32:17.550]  or at least they think they are.
[32:17.550 --> 32:20.130]  And they're serving horribly long sentences
[32:20.130 --> 32:22.230]  by and large for drugs,
[32:22.230 --> 32:24.350]  mostly methamphetamine, crack, cocaine,
[32:24.350 --> 32:26.250]  but certainly there were many, many people there
[32:26.250 --> 32:28.170]  for marijuana serving 10, 15,
[32:28.170 --> 32:32.770]  and even in one case, 25 years for marijuana distribution.
[32:32.770 --> 32:36.930]  So I was able to be very productive in jail.
[32:36.930 --> 32:37.930]  I wrote a lot.
[32:37.930 --> 32:39.090]  I blogged.
[32:39.090 --> 32:40.570]  I read a book every week.
[32:40.570 --> 32:42.630]  I had 25 magazine subscriptions.
[32:42.630 --> 32:44.750]  I got the New York Times every day.
[32:44.750 --> 32:47.490]  I learned how to play the bass guitar
[32:47.490 --> 32:49.850]  and was in an outstanding rock and roll band
[32:49.850 --> 32:52.050]  of incredibly talented musicians.
[32:52.050 --> 32:54.370]  And all of them were very patient
[32:54.370 --> 32:57.490]  and teaching me at no charge for anything,
[32:57.490 --> 33:01.530]  music and music principles and how to be a bass guitarist.
[33:01.530 --> 33:04.530]  And I must tell you that it was a very redemptive
[33:04.530 --> 33:07.010]  and meaningful experience being in prison.
[33:07.010 --> 33:09.830]  And I hope I always carry the message forward
[33:09.830 --> 33:13.810]  that I saw there that it is a very wrong society
[33:13.810 --> 33:15.450]  that punishes people for drugs
[33:15.450 --> 33:17.450]  and puts them in jail for decades
[33:17.450 --> 33:19.730]  and takes them away from their family and their children
[33:19.730 --> 33:22.010]  and essentially ruins their life
[33:22.010 --> 33:24.330]  because of a lifestyle choice they made.
[33:25.170 --> 33:26.010]  And we manufacture crime.
[33:26.010 --> 33:27.090]  With the drug laws, we actually create-
[33:27.090 --> 33:30.330]  All right, guys, Mark Emery can talk for quite a while.
[33:30.330 --> 33:31.290]  I'm gonna kind of fade out.
[33:31.290 --> 33:33.330]  Adam's telling me that I should play this stuff
[33:33.330 --> 33:34.170]  at the end of the video
[33:34.170 --> 33:36.370]  because it's a lot more moving and compelling.
[33:36.370 --> 33:37.210]  I'm gonna save that.
[33:37.210 --> 33:38.170]  I'm gonna tease it a little bit.
[33:38.170 --> 33:39.890]  I'm gonna make sure that I can get permission.
[33:39.890 --> 33:41.930]  That was about a minute and a half there.
[33:41.930 --> 33:43.930]  I hope I don't get in any kind of trouble.
[33:43.930 --> 33:45.930]  If they take down this episode, I apologize.
[33:45.930 --> 33:48.530]  All it was was some news and a Mark Emery rant anyway.
[33:48.530 --> 33:50.330]  You're right, I didn't get a backup.
[33:50.330 --> 33:51.250]  But anyways- Yeah, I'll just cut that out
[33:51.250 --> 33:52.090]  and we'll fix it.
[33:52.090 --> 33:52.930]  That's right.
[33:52.930 --> 33:53.750]  Good idea.
[33:53.950 --> 33:57.590]  The message after he gets through this,
[33:57.590 --> 33:59.230]  what I did in jail stuff, you know?
[33:59.230 --> 34:01.750]  And I mean, that's moving, trust me.
[34:01.750 --> 34:03.750]  But his message towards the end
[34:03.750 --> 34:05.870]  is definitely what you need to hear.
[34:05.870 --> 34:07.470]  And it's what we need to do.
[34:07.470 --> 34:11.990]  So take the video, take 30 minutes and watch it.
[34:11.990 --> 34:12.950]  Yeah, if they let me-
[34:12.950 --> 34:14.550]  Whoa, that was loud, I apologize.
[34:14.550 --> 34:15.390]  If they let me play that,
[34:15.390 --> 34:17.870]  I'll play the last few minutes at the end of this show here.
[34:17.870 --> 34:19.830]  I'm gonna wait for the email, try to be respectful.
[34:19.830 --> 34:20.730]  And if I don't get the email
[34:20.730 --> 34:22.330]  by the time I post the episode,
[34:23.290 --> 34:25.530]  then I won't do it, I'm sorry.
[34:25.530 --> 34:30.530]  So in Denver, part of this article,
[34:30.650 --> 34:31.870]  I'm gonna kind of paraphrase it
[34:31.870 --> 34:32.710]  because it's a lot of stuff.
[34:32.710 --> 34:33.770]  And the episode's getting long already.
[34:33.770 --> 34:36.590]  I got a couple more things I wanna read about.
[34:36.590 --> 34:38.210]  This is from the Cannabis also.
[34:38.210 --> 34:40.250]  This was actually published August 12th.
[34:40.250 --> 34:43.870]  It's by Alida Laback from the Cannabis staff.
[34:43.870 --> 34:46.330]  I didn't say that right, I'm sure, but I'm sorry.
[34:46.330 --> 34:51.330]  This one is, so Governor Hickenlooper,
[34:52.970 --> 34:57.370]  John Hickenlooper placed these giant cages
[34:57.370 --> 34:59.150]  around places in Denver.
[35:00.210 --> 35:01.490]  He put one in front of a skate park,
[35:01.490 --> 35:03.650]  he put one in front of a library in Denver,
[35:03.650 --> 35:05.090]  the Denver Public Library.
[35:06.130 --> 35:08.790]  And they're big cages that look like your hamster cage
[35:08.790 --> 35:10.750]  and they call it a lab rat cage.
[35:10.750 --> 35:13.790]  It's a lab rat cage that says, don't be a lab rat.
[35:13.790 --> 35:17.790]  And on the inside, it's got a little thing
[35:17.790 --> 35:19.270]  that tells you about cannabis
[35:19.270 --> 35:21.750]  and the problems that cannabis can cause you.
[35:21.750 --> 35:24.330]  And it's saying, don't be a lab rat to cannabis
[35:24.330 --> 35:26.890]  to encourage kids to not smoke weed.
[35:28.030 --> 35:33.030]  Well, if you put a big 12 foot tall lab rat looking cage
[35:34.030 --> 35:36.310]  with a giant, looks like those water bottles
[35:36.310 --> 35:38.910]  that hang upside down that your hamster licks to get water.
[35:38.910 --> 35:40.850]  And then it's got a little green thing on the outside
[35:40.850 --> 35:43.250]  that talks about cannabis on it, a little note.
[35:43.870 --> 35:45.270]  If you wanna come around on the side of the computer, bro,
[35:45.270 --> 35:46.870]  and take a look, it's definitely worth looking at.
[35:46.870 --> 35:47.710]  It's funny.
[35:48.990 --> 35:49.830]  Am I right?
[35:49.830 --> 35:51.710]  It looks just like a people cage for hamsters
[35:51.710 --> 35:53.070]  or a hamster cage for peoples.
[35:53.070 --> 35:54.110]  It is a people cage.
[35:54.110 --> 35:55.390]  It is a people cage.
[35:55.390 --> 35:58.510]  And so the article says, well, that didn't take long.
[35:58.510 --> 35:59.870]  The state of Colorado debuted
[35:59.870 --> 36:03.070]  its don't be a lab rat youth campaign on Monday, August 11th
[36:03.070 --> 36:05.750]  by dropping human size laboratory cages
[36:05.750 --> 36:06.830]  around the Denver area,
[36:06.830 --> 36:08.890]  including outside the Denver Public Library
[36:08.890 --> 36:10.610]  and the downtown skate park.
[36:11.490 --> 36:15.370]  Vandalized signs at the skate park installation
[36:15.370 --> 36:18.410]  were reported Monday evening by CBS4.
[36:18.410 --> 36:19.690]  The cages feature posters
[36:19.690 --> 36:21.970]  that cite controversial marijuana research studies
[36:21.970 --> 36:25.170]  and ask open-ended questions about pot use,
[36:25.170 --> 36:26.450]  about youth pot use.
[36:26.450 --> 36:28.130]  Sorry, that was a hard sentence.
[36:28.130 --> 36:30.230]  Some cleverly crossed out a reference
[36:30.230 --> 36:33.690]  to negative effects of marijuana and changed it to positive.
[36:33.690 --> 36:36.730]  Although another message left on the poster says,
[36:36.730 --> 36:39.450]  critically, smoking weed saved my life.
[36:40.730 --> 36:43.210]  The campaign which targets teens with messages
[36:43.210 --> 36:45.170]  that marijuana research is ongoing,
[36:45.170 --> 36:49.770]  particularly in studies of the developing brain
[36:49.770 --> 36:52.170]  is trying a different tact
[36:52.170 --> 36:55.690]  from the just say no anti-drug campaigns of yore.
[36:55.690 --> 36:57.350]  There are a few variations of the posters
[36:57.350 --> 36:58.990]  that adorn the giant cages.
[36:58.990 --> 37:02.290]  So a new message is sure to replace the vandalized signs.
[37:02.290 --> 37:05.490]  The vandalism was taken in stride by Dr. Larry Wolk,
[37:05.490 --> 37:07.390]  who leads the state health department.
[37:07.390 --> 37:09.090]  If they are defacing it
[37:09.090 --> 37:11.250]  or they're doing something with regard to graffiti
[37:11.250 --> 37:12.490]  or gathering in the cages,
[37:12.490 --> 37:16.650]  at least they're taking notice and let the debate occur.
[37:16.650 --> 37:18.650]  They're probably just breaking that shit
[37:18.650 --> 37:20.650]  while they're smoking a joint.
[37:20.650 --> 37:22.290]  To be perfectly honest.
[37:22.290 --> 37:25.750]  Oh, there was also the man who toked up inside the cage
[37:25.750 --> 37:28.590]  at the skate park, according to the TV station report.
[37:28.590 --> 37:29.770]  So somebody was-
[37:29.770 --> 37:30.850]  That's what I think it is.
[37:30.850 --> 37:32.090]  Is this marijuana activists?
[37:32.090 --> 37:32.930]  I mean, it's Denver.
[37:32.930 --> 37:35.610]  You know, it's not like there's not enough of them.
[37:35.610 --> 37:37.970]  You know, obviously people got off their ass
[37:37.970 --> 37:41.370]  and signed enough papers that it's legal here, you know?
[37:41.370 --> 37:43.690]  The $2 million project,
[37:43.690 --> 37:46.630]  which includes a stylized website,
[37:46.630 --> 37:51.090]  is funded by a grant paid by legal settlements
[37:51.090 --> 37:52.850]  with various pharmaceutical companies,
[37:52.850 --> 37:54.930]  according to the governor's office.
[37:54.930 --> 37:58.770]  Another component of the Don't Be a Lab Rat campaign
[37:58.770 --> 38:00.790]  are the TV ads, as seen below.
[38:00.790 --> 38:01.930]  We're not gonna watch these stupid ass commercials.
[38:01.930 --> 38:03.850]  Where does big pharma get off
[38:03.850 --> 38:05.810]  by telling you not to be a lab rat?
[38:05.810 --> 38:07.930]  Well, they need your money.
[38:08.770 --> 38:11.610]  I get that they want you on Zoloft instead of weed, but.
[38:12.770 --> 38:13.610]  Dude.
[38:13.610 --> 38:17.610]  Yep, well, most of our listeners
[38:17.610 --> 38:20.230]  probably haven't seen these gigantic lab rat cages.
[38:20.230 --> 38:21.450]  It's quite entertaining.
[38:21.450 --> 38:23.570]  They've posted, there are three or four stories
[38:23.570 --> 38:24.850]  on the cannabis about it.
[38:24.850 --> 38:26.170]  We were down there the other day.
[38:26.170 --> 38:27.290]  I would have liked to go get a picture.
[38:27.290 --> 38:28.410]  You know, that's a good idea.
[38:28.410 --> 38:30.570]  We should have gone and checked it out.
[38:30.570 --> 38:31.970]  If you want to jump around on this side again
[38:31.970 --> 38:34.490]  and take a look, there's actually people inside of this one
[38:34.490 --> 38:35.970]  as they were building it.
[38:36.010 --> 38:37.930]  There, I'll move the email out of the way.
[38:37.930 --> 38:40.730]  That's the people cage they're working with right there.
[38:42.690 --> 38:44.930]  It's essentially a lion cage from the zoo.
[38:44.930 --> 38:46.170]  Yeah, it's a lion.
[38:46.170 --> 38:47.370]  It looks like a lion cage.
[38:47.370 --> 38:51.370]  It looks like a large cat, small enclosure.
[38:51.370 --> 38:53.290]  Is that 10 by 10 by 10 by 10 by 10?
[38:53.290 --> 38:54.130]  Yeah. By 10?
[38:54.130 --> 38:54.950]  I don't even think it's that.
[38:54.950 --> 38:56.130]  It's probably 12 by 10.
[38:56.130 --> 38:56.970]  Okay.
[38:56.970 --> 38:57.790]  You know what I'm saying?
[38:57.790 --> 38:59.370]  It's probably longer than it is wider.
[38:59.370 --> 39:01.210]  But yeah.
[39:01.210 --> 39:04.210]  And there's a lot of scrutiny
[39:04.250 --> 39:07.250]  about how kind of ridiculous it is too
[39:07.250 --> 39:10.070]  from a lot of people by the looks of these websites.
[39:10.070 --> 39:11.570]  So let me click and see how long we're going.
[39:11.570 --> 39:12.410]  Because I don't want to-
[39:12.410 --> 39:13.530]  Hey, it's bigger than a jail cell.
[39:15.170 --> 39:18.170]  I'm just going to keep moving on with that one.
[39:18.170 --> 39:20.570]  We are about 40 minutes in, so we can keep going.
[39:20.570 --> 39:22.250]  We got a couple, we can make this a perfect hour.
[39:22.250 --> 39:23.770]  I bet if we do this, right?
[39:23.770 --> 39:24.610]  All right.
[39:24.610 --> 39:25.430]  All right.
[39:25.430 --> 39:26.270]  I'll try to save a couple of minutes
[39:26.270 --> 39:29.890]  for the Mark Emery part if we get a chance to do that.
[39:29.890 --> 39:32.890]  So this is something random and this only support,
[39:32.890 --> 39:36.090]  I'm reading this because this supports the legalization,
[39:36.090 --> 39:37.930]  the nationwide legalization
[39:37.930 --> 39:40.170]  and decriminalization of cannabis.
[39:40.170 --> 39:41.970]  The headline will say it all for you.
[39:41.970 --> 39:45.930]  New Hampshire declares state of emergency over spice.
[39:45.930 --> 39:46.850]  No shit, right?
[39:46.850 --> 39:47.810]  You know how to cure that?
[39:47.810 --> 39:49.490]  Let us just smoke the weed we want to smoke
[39:49.490 --> 39:51.890]  instead of having to smoke fake spice.
[39:51.890 --> 39:56.250]  A lot of that is probation and jobs.
[39:56.250 --> 39:58.290]  Probation and prohibition and job testing.
[39:58.290 --> 39:59.130]  Yep.
[39:59.170 --> 40:02.890]  I mean, I had personal experience with this
[40:02.890 --> 40:06.210]  where people were like, oh no, it's better than sex, man.
[40:06.210 --> 40:08.490]  You gotta, I've never.
[40:08.490 --> 40:10.470]  And I was like, all right, whatever.
[40:10.470 --> 40:11.690]  And dude, I will never again.
[40:11.690 --> 40:13.450]  I was in the toilet for six hours,
[40:13.450 --> 40:16.290]  like hacking my lungs up, felt like a piece of shit.
[40:16.290 --> 40:17.130]  Yum.
[40:17.130 --> 40:19.090]  And don't ever smoke spice.
[40:19.090 --> 40:19.930]  Yeah.
[40:19.930 --> 40:21.730]  The guys that listen to my show won't smoke spice.
[40:21.730 --> 40:22.570]  Yeah, I know.
[40:22.570 --> 40:24.850]  And Adam will try anything twice.
[40:24.850 --> 40:25.690]  Yeah.
[40:25.690 --> 40:26.530]  He only did spice once.
[40:26.530 --> 40:28.170]  Yep.
[40:28.170 --> 40:29.210]  All right, so I'm gonna read some of the,
[40:29.210 --> 40:30.410]  it doesn't even seem like we need this,
[40:30.410 --> 40:31.370]  gets the point across, right?
[40:31.370 --> 40:32.330]  Yeah, don't.
[40:32.330 --> 40:33.810]  Legalize, I said, I just said fuck.
[40:33.810 --> 40:35.770]  Somebody tweet me and tell me to quit doing it.
[40:35.770 --> 40:36.650]  I'm sorry, guys.
[40:36.650 --> 40:37.490]  I know it's offensive.
[40:37.490 --> 40:38.330]  It's a terrible word.
[40:38.330 --> 40:39.730]  We gotta quit doing that.
[40:39.730 --> 40:41.730]  So it's kind of obvious.
[40:41.730 --> 40:44.870]  Legalize cannabis and we won't have to smoke,
[40:44.870 --> 40:46.690]  they won't have to smoke spice.
[40:48.070 --> 40:51.170]  Employers and probation, some probation,
[40:51.170 --> 40:53.210]  you can't drink alcohol, but employers don't care
[40:53.210 --> 40:56.050]  if you go out at five o'clock or six o'clock
[40:56.050 --> 40:58.170]  or if you go down to panic hour at 6.15
[40:58.170 --> 41:01.250]  and drink 22 beers, your employer doesn't care.
[41:01.250 --> 41:03.010]  But if you smoke a fat joint,
[41:03.010 --> 41:05.730]  man, you might get fired from your job, which is terrible.
[41:05.730 --> 41:06.850]  I'll read part of this.
[41:06.850 --> 41:10.410]  Governor Maggie Hassan has declared a state of emergency
[41:10.410 --> 41:12.390]  to allow public health officials to investigate
[41:12.390 --> 41:15.690]  and quarantine synthetic drugs linked to recent overdoses
[41:15.690 --> 41:17.730]  in Manchester and Concord.
[41:17.730 --> 41:19.410]  And this is New Hampshire, by the way.
[41:19.410 --> 41:22.810]  Authorities say at least 41 people in the Manchester area
[41:22.810 --> 41:25.090]  have experienced serious medical reactions
[41:25.090 --> 41:28.130]  to synthetic cannabinoids known as spice
[41:28.130 --> 41:30.130]  that are chemically engineered substances
[41:30.130 --> 41:32.850]  similar to the active ingredient in marijuana.
[41:34.450 --> 41:36.930]  Let's scrutinize this sentence just for fun.
[41:39.210 --> 41:41.090]  Synthetic cannabinoids, I don't think
[41:41.090 --> 41:42.410]  that that's what that is.
[41:44.250 --> 41:49.250]  It's poser pot known as spice that are chemically engineered
[41:49.290 --> 41:51.210]  chemically engineered substances.
[41:51.210 --> 41:52.450]  That's close, I think.
[41:52.450 --> 41:54.090]  Active ingredient in marijuana.
[41:54.090 --> 41:55.930]  Marijuana doesn't have ingredients.
[41:55.930 --> 41:56.930]  It's a compound, I think,
[41:56.930 --> 41:58.490]  is what you'd wanna call it there.
[41:58.490 --> 42:02.250]  So come on, guys, you're the cannabis, brah.
[42:02.250 --> 42:03.650]  Cannabis properly.
[42:03.650 --> 42:05.150]  Do you even cannabis, bro?
[42:06.410 --> 42:08.130]  Concord police have reported
[42:08.130 --> 42:11.090]  at least three cases since Wednesday.
[42:13.050 --> 42:15.290]  Hassan's declaration gives the State Department of Health
[42:15.290 --> 42:18.370]  and Human Services the power to investigate, quarantine,
[42:18.370 --> 42:20.930]  and require the destruction of the products.
[42:20.930 --> 42:23.330]  She says the department will work with the police
[42:23.370 --> 42:24.970]  to quarantine the bubblegum flavor
[42:24.970 --> 42:27.210]  of a product named Smacked.
[42:27.210 --> 42:29.290]  Such products are labeled as herbal incense
[42:29.290 --> 42:31.690]  but are known to be smoked or brewed.
[42:31.690 --> 42:34.210]  Who wants to take a product called Smacked?
[42:35.090 --> 42:38.370]  I don't know, I might take a dab of a strain called Smacked.
[42:38.370 --> 42:40.930]  Yeah, but not a spice.
[42:40.930 --> 42:43.650]  I mean, people have been doing this for years
[42:43.650 --> 42:47.530]  but they put them in boilers and use them in rooms,
[42:47.530 --> 42:49.890]  you know, like large rooms
[42:49.890 --> 42:51.290]  to give everybody that kind of feeling.
[42:51.290 --> 42:53.290]  Oh my gosh.
[42:54.250 --> 42:55.330]  The frankincense myrrh has been used for that.
[42:55.330 --> 42:57.730]  I'm just imagining what if...
[42:57.730 --> 42:59.530]  For years, but they never grabbed it
[42:59.530 --> 43:03.250]  and put it in the bong and like, yeah, let's get baked.
[43:03.250 --> 43:04.930]  No, they had herb for that
[43:04.930 --> 43:07.810]  because it wasn't against the law then, you know?
[43:07.810 --> 43:10.770]  It wasn't all around the world.
[43:10.770 --> 43:12.650]  It's still looked at as something crazy
[43:12.650 --> 43:16.970]  and people are gonna try to get it one way or the other.
[43:16.970 --> 43:20.050]  Well, here's some decently uplifting news.
[43:20.050 --> 43:22.050]  Utah Medical Marijuana Program,
[43:22.050 --> 43:25.970]  11 cards issued, several for child patients.
[43:25.970 --> 43:29.810]  This is by Michelle L. Price of the Associated Press.
[43:29.810 --> 43:31.610]  In Salt Lake City,
[43:31.610 --> 43:34.050]  Utah issued nearly a dozen registration cards
[43:34.050 --> 43:36.810]  in the first month of its limited medical marijuana program
[43:36.810 --> 43:38.770]  that allows those with severe epilepsy
[43:38.770 --> 43:41.610]  to possess cannabis extract oil.
[43:42.570 --> 43:44.690]  This was August 9th, so this is kind of old news
[43:44.690 --> 43:47.050]  but I just wanted to put out some news and catch up.
[43:47.050 --> 43:49.610]  As of Friday evening, the state has issued 11 cards
[43:50.130 --> 43:52.650]  since the program started July 8th, said Janice Houston,
[43:52.650 --> 43:54.490]  the state registrar and director
[43:54.490 --> 43:57.370]  of the Utah Department of Health's records office.
[43:57.370 --> 43:58.890]  About half of those 11 cards
[43:58.890 --> 44:01.490]  were issued for child patients, Houston said.
[44:01.490 --> 44:04.730]  An application for another card is pending.
[44:04.730 --> 44:06.970]  Health department officials on Friday also announced
[44:06.970 --> 44:11.250]  the $400 annual fee for the cards had been cut in half.
[44:11.250 --> 44:14.050]  The program's startup fee were less than expected
[44:14.050 --> 44:17.690]  and the registration cards will now cost $200, Houston said.
[44:18.690 --> 44:21.730]  Dude, there are 11 cards and one more being applied for
[44:21.730 --> 44:23.090]  in the state of Utah.
[44:24.250 --> 44:25.370]  I was at a party the other night
[44:25.370 --> 44:27.970]  and there were probably 11 medical marijuana cards
[44:27.970 --> 44:28.810]  in the room.
[44:28.810 --> 44:30.050]  Yeah.
[44:30.050 --> 44:32.010]  It's a huge relief, said Jennifer May,
[44:32.010 --> 44:33.730]  with hope for children with epilepsy.
[44:33.730 --> 44:35.970]  We've been trying to find ways to help the families
[44:35.970 --> 44:37.330]  come up with that money
[44:37.330 --> 44:39.810]  along with the money for the oil itself.
[44:39.810 --> 44:41.530]  Those who already paid the higher fee
[44:41.530 --> 44:43.730]  will be refunded, health officials said.
[44:43.730 --> 44:46.090]  Utah's law doesn't allow the distribution
[44:46.090 --> 44:46.970]  of medical marijuana
[44:47.290 --> 44:48.850]  but it permits those meeting certain requirements
[44:48.850 --> 44:52.690]  to possess the extract after getting it from other states.
[44:52.690 --> 44:56.650]  So they can at least get what they need to from Colorado.
[44:56.650 --> 44:57.970]  Wow, yeah.
[44:57.970 --> 45:00.370]  That's, hey, you know.
[45:00.370 --> 45:02.930]  That's a step in the right direction, honestly, you know.
[45:02.930 --> 45:05.370]  The extract, this is, I'm frustrated.
[45:05.370 --> 45:06.210]  They fuck up right here.
[45:06.210 --> 45:08.610]  The extract called cannabidiol.
[45:08.610 --> 45:10.650]  Okay, man, that's, they're looking for that CBD
[45:10.650 --> 45:12.410]  but that's not the extract.
[45:12.410 --> 45:16.090]  The, ah, come on, cannabis, please.
[45:16.090 --> 45:17.970]  The extract called cannabidiol
[45:17.970 --> 45:19.770]  is believed to help with severe seizures,
[45:19.770 --> 45:22.250]  particularly those experienced by children
[45:22.250 --> 45:24.450]  with a severe form of epilepsy.
[45:26.690 --> 45:28.370]  Georgia's also looking at that too.
[45:28.370 --> 45:30.050]  Close, guys, nice try.
[45:30.050 --> 45:32.330]  It's not an extract called cannabidiol.
[45:32.330 --> 45:35.650]  Cannabidiol is a cannabinoid
[45:35.650 --> 45:38.210]  but one of the cannabinoids in the extract
[45:38.210 --> 45:39.850]  but I see what you're doing.
[45:39.850 --> 45:40.690]  Nice try, guys.
[45:40.690 --> 45:42.810]  You got it, that, you've fucked me up
[45:42.810 --> 45:44.330]  a couple times in this article.
[45:44.330 --> 45:47.050]  So the oil doesn't have the psychoactive properties
[45:47.050 --> 45:49.630]  that gets users high and can be mixed with food
[45:49.630 --> 45:51.030]  such as applesauce.
[45:53.250 --> 45:56.010]  I wonder if they'd be able to bring back the OG caps
[45:56.010 --> 45:58.770]  because those OG caps from essential extracts
[45:58.770 --> 46:00.770]  available at Natural Mystic Cannabis Caregivers,
[46:00.770 --> 46:03.330]  which is a medical shop, man.
[46:03.330 --> 46:05.410]  So they're gonna have to get a Colorado residency
[46:05.410 --> 46:07.130]  and get a medical marijuana card in Colorado
[46:07.130 --> 46:10.610]  to even acquire this type of medicine to get it to Utah.
[46:10.610 --> 46:11.570]  Maybe not in Dipper.
[46:11.570 --> 46:14.170]  You know, maybe there's something a little more.
[46:15.010 --> 46:15.850]  Yeah, hopefully.
[46:15.850 --> 46:16.670]  Nowadays.
[46:16.670 --> 46:17.690]  All right, we'll keep going.
[46:17.690 --> 46:19.250]  The cost of cannabidiol varies
[46:19.250 --> 46:20.490]  depending on the size of the patient
[46:20.490 --> 46:22.690]  and the level of the dose the patient is receiving.
[46:22.690 --> 46:23.650]  For a 100 pound person,
[46:23.650 --> 46:26.770]  a month's supply of a beginning dose is about 40 bucks.
[46:26.770 --> 46:28.410]  A maximum dose for the same patient
[46:28.410 --> 46:30.850]  could cost up to $900 a month.
[46:30.850 --> 46:35.810]  What they are talking about seems to be Phoenix Tears,
[46:35.810 --> 46:39.370]  Rick Simpson oil, Fool Plant Cannabis Extract,
[46:39.370 --> 46:41.250]  Fool Extract Cannabis Oil.
[46:41.730 --> 46:43.850]  Um, it's Orally Eatin',
[46:43.850 --> 46:46.570]  it's black usually or greenish colored.
[46:46.570 --> 46:48.430]  They're not talking about dabs or anything.
[46:48.430 --> 46:50.130]  So it's basically Rick Simpson oil,
[46:50.130 --> 46:51.750]  if you guys are familiar with that.
[46:51.750 --> 46:54.210]  There's a movie called Run From The Cure,
[46:54.210 --> 46:55.370]  I believe is what it's called.
[46:55.370 --> 46:56.410]  Race for the Cure.
[46:56.410 --> 46:57.930]  It's Run From The Cure, the Rick Simpson story.
[46:57.930 --> 47:00.730]  Search for the name Rick Simpson and then put cannabis oil
[47:00.730 --> 47:01.970]  and you'll find the movie I'm talking about.
[47:01.970 --> 47:03.530]  Learn about Rick Simpson oil.
[47:03.530 --> 47:06.490]  A lot of people say Rick Simpson may have stolen that recipe
[47:06.490 --> 47:07.590]  and gotten famous off of it.
[47:07.590 --> 47:08.430]  I don't care.
[47:08.430 --> 47:09.650]  He's helping a lot of people do your thing.
[47:09.650 --> 47:10.810]  Shout out Rick Simpson.
[47:11.410 --> 47:12.250]  Give thanks.
[47:12.250 --> 47:13.070]  There we go.
[47:13.070 --> 47:14.530]  We just did a give thanks section on accident.
[47:14.530 --> 47:16.330]  The main producer of the extract in Colorado
[47:16.330 --> 47:18.250]  has a waiting list with thousands of names
[47:18.250 --> 47:20.970]  and doesn't expect to have more supply until fall.
[47:20.970 --> 47:22.410]  And other producers of the product
[47:22.410 --> 47:25.450]  have also, also have a waiting list, May said.
[47:25.450 --> 47:28.170]  Because Utah's registration cards expire year after year,
[47:28.170 --> 47:31.890]  many families are expected to apply later this year.
[47:31.890 --> 47:34.050]  About a hundred families are expected to take advantage
[47:34.050 --> 47:37.010]  of Utah's program, health department officials said.
[47:37.010 --> 47:39.130]  May, whose 12 year old son can suffer
[47:39.130 --> 47:42.370]  hundreds of seizures a day, said she and many other families
[47:42.370 --> 47:44.570]  are also waiting to see if they can secure a spot
[47:44.570 --> 47:46.970]  in a pending drug trial by neurologists
[47:46.970 --> 47:49.970]  at primary children's hospital in Salt Lake City.
[47:49.970 --> 47:52.090]  Once families receive a registration card,
[47:52.090 --> 47:54.770]  they could face additional hurdles
[47:54.770 --> 47:56.830]  to actually get the extract from other states,
[47:56.830 --> 47:58.430]  including enrolling in that state's
[47:58.430 --> 48:00.130]  medical marijuana program.
[48:00.130 --> 48:02.670]  All state marijuana programs, medical or otherwise,
[48:02.670 --> 48:04.450]  are still illegal under federal law.
[48:04.450 --> 48:06.970]  And some doctors and advocacy groups have warned,
[48:06.970 --> 48:11.210]  there's no proof the extract is effective at treating epilepsy.
[48:11.210 --> 48:13.530]  But families say it's worth the time and cost
[48:13.530 --> 48:16.970]  if it brings relief to those suffering from seizures.
[48:16.970 --> 48:21.130]  All right, do you think these people are going to pay $400
[48:21.130 --> 48:23.950]  or now $200 to get the medical marijuana card that they
[48:23.950 --> 48:27.890]  require and then go spend money in another state?
[48:27.890 --> 48:29.970]  They're going to travel to Colorado
[48:29.970 --> 48:35.170]  to get this oil that costs up to $900 for a freaking dose,
[48:35.170 --> 48:36.370]  a month dose.
[48:36.370 --> 48:38.250]  They're going to drive from Colorado to Utah.
[48:38.250 --> 48:40.090]  They're going to spend a couple of hundred bucks in gas.
[48:40.090 --> 48:41.610]  They're going to spend a day away.
[48:41.610 --> 48:45.010]  They're probably traveling with a child with seizures.
[48:45.010 --> 48:47.170]  Are they going to waste, and excuse this one,
[48:47.170 --> 48:50.810]  are they going to waste that fucking time if this medicine doesn't work?
[48:50.810 --> 48:54.490]  If they're just, no, there must be something working, right?
[48:54.490 --> 48:57.690]  There's that documentary that I linked you not that long ago
[48:57.690 --> 49:00.530]  that literally you watch these people uproot their life.
[49:00.530 --> 49:01.870]  They come out here and they try it.
[49:01.870 --> 49:03.210]  I'm pretty sure I've seen that one, yeah.
[49:03.210 --> 49:04.730]  Then they go back to their home state,
[49:04.730 --> 49:11.250]  and their home state's giving them a 0.0 or 0.something CBD value.
[49:11.250 --> 49:13.490]  They had to uproot their lives and move to Colorado.
[49:13.490 --> 49:16.330]  I mean, there's a million stories like it all over.
[49:16.330 --> 49:19.490]  You throw a stone here and you can pretty much find
[49:19.490 --> 49:22.730]  what they're calling the marijuana refugees.
[49:22.730 --> 49:23.930]  Yes.
[49:23.930 --> 49:28.130]  It's hard, man, and absolutely.
[49:28.130 --> 49:31.330]  This dude, the story you just read said half the people we get
[49:31.330 --> 49:32.570]  are coming from out of state.
[49:32.570 --> 49:34.330]  Yes, I think he said 70.
[49:35.130 --> 49:37.210]  Why would people not come here to help their children
[49:37.210 --> 49:40.850]  that is in desperate need of a word themselves?
[49:40.850 --> 49:44.530]  People are packing up their entire lives and moving to another state
[49:44.530 --> 49:47.410]  because we can offer them a medicine that is obviously working.
[49:47.410 --> 49:48.930]  There's plenty of video documentary out there.
[49:48.930 --> 49:50.450]  I'm not going to say it's going to work for everybody.
[49:50.450 --> 49:52.610]  Yes, the union was the first time I ever saw that.
[49:52.610 --> 49:56.290]  There's a guy that he's all shaky, and I don't mean to be rude about it.
[49:56.290 --> 49:57.330]  He's really shaky.
[49:57.330 --> 49:59.450]  He smoked and it was gone.
[49:59.450 --> 50:01.530]  Yes, he goes right back to not shaky.
[50:02.250 --> 50:04.450]  So, we got time for one more quick news article.
[50:04.450 --> 50:10.370]  Seattle pot tickets, one cop wrote 80% of citations.
[50:10.370 --> 50:13.250]  What were they calling that one guy out there in California
[50:13.250 --> 50:14.650]  when it really boomed?
[50:14.650 --> 50:17.050]  There was one dude out there.
[50:17.050 --> 50:20.010]  You know who I'm talking about that was just standing outside of pot shops
[50:20.010 --> 50:21.850]  like writing people citations.
[50:21.850 --> 50:23.890]  Yes, I don't remember his name, but yes.
[50:23.890 --> 50:25.690]  So, this is from Seattle.
[50:25.690 --> 50:28.450]  A Seattle police officer has been reassigned after a review.
[50:28.490 --> 50:32.530]  After a review found, he wrote about 80% of marijuana tickets issued
[50:32.530 --> 50:36.610]  in the city during the first half of 2014.
[50:36.610 --> 50:42.050]  Seattle police chief Kathleen O'Toole said July 30 on the department website
[50:42.050 --> 50:47.010]  that the unidentified officer issued 66 of the 83 citations
[50:47.010 --> 50:49.170]  for public pot use in Seattle.
[50:49.170 --> 50:51.690]  She says that in some cases, he added notes to the tickets
[50:51.690 --> 50:55.690]  or addressed them to Seattle City Attorney Pete Holmes.
[50:55.690 --> 50:59.730]  In another case, the officer reportedly said he flipped a coin
[50:59.730 --> 51:01.930]  when deciding which person to cite.
[51:01.930 --> 51:05.810]  O'Toole says the officer also wrote on the voter approved state initiative
[51:05.810 --> 51:09.730]  legalizing recreational marijuana was silly.
[51:09.730 --> 51:12.810]  The police chief said that the case has been referred
[51:12.810 --> 51:15.490]  to the department's official of professional accountability.
[51:15.490 --> 51:21.930]  She says the officer won't be on patrol duties during the investigation.
[51:21.930 --> 51:24.530]  Big middle finger to that cop.
[51:24.570 --> 51:26.290]  That's all I gotta say about that one.
[51:26.290 --> 51:27.690]  Just hatin'.
[51:27.690 --> 51:28.690]  Yeah.
[51:28.690 --> 51:30.690]  Let some people smoke some weed, man.
[51:30.690 --> 51:31.530]  You don't know their story.
[51:31.530 --> 51:33.610]  Maybe they had something crazy.
[51:33.610 --> 51:37.050]  Maybe weed killed their dad or something, I guess,
[51:37.050 --> 51:39.290]  if that had ever happened.
[51:39.290 --> 51:40.610]  You know, I don't know.
[51:40.610 --> 51:41.170]  I'm just sayin'.
[51:41.170 --> 51:42.290]  Weed never killed anybody, dude.
[51:42.290 --> 51:42.810]  Don't say that.
[51:42.810 --> 51:43.610]  I understand that, but I'm just sayin'.
[51:43.610 --> 51:46.210]  The only way that you can be killed by marijuana,
[51:46.210 --> 51:49.170]  the only way you can be killed by cannabis is if a bunch of it
[51:49.170 --> 51:52.370]  falls on top of you or if a cop beats you up for having it in your pocket.
[51:52.410 --> 51:53.050]  That's what I'm sayin'.
[51:53.050 --> 51:55.090]  Maybe her dad got crushed by thousands of pounds.
[51:55.090 --> 51:56.130]  Crushed by tons of weed?
[51:56.130 --> 51:57.730]  Yeah.
[51:57.730 --> 51:59.490]  Imagine that stanky death.
[51:59.490 --> 52:02.010]  Who's got a lighter, would all be here thinking about?
[52:02.010 --> 52:03.650]  Just burn this on top of me.
[52:03.650 --> 52:04.970]  Nothing horrible.
[52:04.970 --> 52:07.050]  I'm not saying he smoked a joint and died.
[52:07.050 --> 52:08.730]  You know, I'm saying that.
[52:08.730 --> 52:12.650]  I'm just gonna wrap that part of this talk up.
[52:12.650 --> 52:13.170]  All right, guys.
[52:13.170 --> 52:16.010]  We have gone, we're pretty close to an hour now.
[52:16.010 --> 52:20.770]  So I'm not sure if they are going to let me play more of that Mark Emery video.
[52:20.770 --> 52:22.770]  If they do, it'll happen here.
[52:22.770 --> 52:27.450]  I mean, that's, if you'd have told me,
[52:27.450 --> 52:31.170]  Mark, you're gonna spend the next 25 years, you know,
[52:31.170 --> 52:34.050]  smoking joints and bongs and selling seeds,
[52:34.050 --> 52:37.090]  and you're gonna go to jail for many, many years of your life.
[52:37.090 --> 52:41.250]  But one day, after 25 years of you being arrested,
[52:41.250 --> 52:42.850]  of you going to jail, of you being taken away,
[52:42.850 --> 52:44.290]  of you losing all your assets,
[52:44.290 --> 52:46.530]  of you being separated from your family and your wife,
[52:46.930 --> 52:50.650]  after all that, you're gonna have one day,
[52:50.650 --> 52:53.090]  one day in 2015,
[52:53.090 --> 52:56.050]  and if you can get your people together,
[52:56.050 --> 52:58.570]  it all ends on that day.
[52:58.570 --> 53:02.730]  On that day, the next day after that day,
[53:02.730 --> 53:04.930]  the stores will start selling marijuana.
[53:04.930 --> 53:07.970]  People will walk the streets confident about the marijuana in their pocket.
[53:07.970 --> 53:09.410]  They're not gonna get arrested.
[53:09.410 --> 53:13.490]  There will be medical marijuana science experiments and advancements
[53:13.490 --> 53:14.690]  every day after that,
[53:14.730 --> 53:18.210]  because it'll be legal to study marijuana in universities.
[53:18.210 --> 53:20.890]  It'll be legal for doctors to recommend it.
[53:20.890 --> 53:25.770]  It'll be legal for doctors, judges, cops, politicians to smoke it
[53:25.770 --> 53:28.210]  and share it and understand it.
[53:28.210 --> 53:30.050]  It'll be legal to go and buy it.
[53:30.050 --> 53:31.930]  It'll be legal for ordinary people to grow it.
[53:31.930 --> 53:34.850]  It'll be legal for people to have a business that grows marijuana.
[53:34.850 --> 53:37.850]  It'll be legal for everybody to make vape prices and bongs.
[53:37.850 --> 53:40.890]  All the books and magazines about marijuana will all be legal.
[53:40.890 --> 53:43.370]  No one will ever try and ban them ever again.
[53:43.410 --> 53:46.610]  No one will ever say a bad thing about pot smokers as a culture,
[53:46.610 --> 53:49.930]  as a way of demonizing them and sending them to jail,
[53:49.930 --> 53:53.850]  because, Mark, in 25 years,
[53:53.850 --> 53:57.930]  that one day, everybody showed up,
[53:57.930 --> 54:00.570]  and it was a happy, wonderful world ever since,
[54:00.570 --> 54:02.530]  because everybody showed up.
[54:02.530 --> 54:04.290]  So that's my message.
[54:04.290 --> 54:06.570]  We've got a big opportunity coming in 14 months.
[54:06.570 --> 54:08.850]  I'm gonna be touring the country relentlessly,
[54:08.850 --> 54:11.490]  telling everybody, even in other countries,
[54:11.490 --> 54:15.010]  you just need one day where everybody we know
[54:15.010 --> 54:16.850]  who smokes pot shows up.
[54:16.850 --> 54:18.330]  That'll be my message in Ireland.
[54:18.330 --> 54:19.610]  It'll be my message in Spain.
[54:19.610 --> 54:21.250]  It'll be my message in Vienna.
[54:21.250 --> 54:22.970]  It's gonna be my message all across Canada.
[54:22.970 --> 54:25.610]  And it's certainly my message to all Americans
[54:25.610 --> 54:28.930]  who go to vote in Oregon and Alaska and Florida
[54:28.930 --> 54:31.010]  and Washington District of Columbia
[54:31.010 --> 54:32.570]  on the first Tuesday in November.
[54:32.570 --> 54:36.250]  If you show up, you'll never need to think about this ever again.
[54:36.250 --> 54:38.130]  You'll just be allowed to enjoy.
[54:38.130 --> 54:40.330]  You'll be allowed to be part of a culture
[54:40.330 --> 54:42.650]  that ought to be one of the most respected cultures
[54:42.650 --> 54:44.090]  in the history of mankind.
[54:44.090 --> 54:45.370]  Because I'll tell you this,
[54:45.370 --> 54:48.570]  the cannabis culture has given more to humanity
[54:48.570 --> 54:51.810]  and mankind, humankind, in science and entertainment
[54:51.810 --> 54:54.170]  and theater and arts, books, and culture,
[54:54.170 --> 54:55.730]  and especially in music
[54:55.730 --> 54:58.650]  than any other culture of the last hundred years.
[54:58.650 --> 55:00.690]  The cannabis culture is one of the greatest cultures
[55:00.690 --> 55:01.730]  in the history of mankind,
[55:01.730 --> 55:04.050]  starting with William Shakespeare, who smoked marijuana.
[55:04.050 --> 55:05.930]  Cannabis, actually.
[55:05.930 --> 55:09.370]  So many great poets and writers and musicians
[55:09.370 --> 55:12.570]  and scientists and doctors and explorers,
[55:12.570 --> 55:16.650]  and to this day, our movers and shakers,
[55:16.650 --> 55:20.650]  Bill Gates, Stephen Jobs, pot smokers.
[55:20.650 --> 55:23.050]  You know, Carl Sagan, pot smoker.
[55:23.050 --> 55:26.410]  Every musician you've ever cared to really enjoy a pot smoker.
[55:26.410 --> 55:29.130]  Most of the people who write today's great bestsellers
[55:29.130 --> 55:31.090]  and make today's great movies are pot smokers,
[55:31.090 --> 55:32.210]  including actors.
[55:33.170 --> 55:35.090]  We are a great culture,
[55:35.090 --> 55:37.330]  but we have been denied our official right
[55:37.370 --> 55:40.050]  to be regarded as first-class citizens like everybody else
[55:40.050 --> 55:41.650]  who makes contributions
[55:41.650 --> 55:44.770]  and who ought to be acknowledged as a culture.
[55:44.770 --> 55:47.690]  And so if they'd have told me 25 years ago,
[55:47.690 --> 55:49.250]  Mark, it's going to be a long road
[55:49.250 --> 55:50.250]  with a lot of difficulties,
[55:50.250 --> 55:52.770]  but one day in 2015,
[55:52.770 --> 55:54.450]  one day it all becomes real
[55:54.450 --> 55:57.290]  if you can get your people to show up.
[55:57.290 --> 55:58.130]  So that's my message.
[55:58.130 --> 55:58.970]  Thanks very much.
[55:58.970 --> 56:00.530]  I look forward to partying with you tonight.
[56:00.530 --> 56:01.370]  Thank you.
[56:01.370 --> 56:02.210]  We'll be back.
[56:02.210 --> 56:04.320]  Yeah.
[56:09.440 --> 56:11.480]  I need to give a big shout out to Jodi Emery.
[56:11.480 --> 56:13.840]  I emailed Jodi and she gave me permission
[56:13.840 --> 56:15.160]  to use these videos.
[56:15.160 --> 56:16.960]  So we got to give them a big thanks.
[56:16.960 --> 56:20.080]  I also need to give a big shout out to cannabisculture.com.
[56:20.080 --> 56:22.360]  If you want some great cannabis news,
[56:22.360 --> 56:24.480]  if you're online and not able to listen to a podcast,
[56:24.480 --> 56:27.000]  make sure you check out cannabisculture.com.
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.280]  There's a lot of videos and updates from Mark.
[56:29.280 --> 56:32.440]  Also go to YouTube and check out the Pot TV channel.
[56:32.440 --> 56:35.240]  There are a lot of great Mark Emery videos.
[56:35.240 --> 56:36.080]  I will start,
[56:36.080 --> 56:37.800]  I'll try to play some Mark Emery videos
[56:37.880 --> 56:39.480]  at the end of the episodes that are short.
[56:39.480 --> 56:41.120]  That way we can fill in a little time.
[56:41.120 --> 56:42.440]  If the episodes are long,
[56:42.440 --> 56:43.400]  I won't put that in there.
[56:43.400 --> 56:45.520]  We'll just try to get them closer to an hour.
[56:45.520 --> 56:46.680]  All right guys, I'm high and rambling.
[56:46.680 --> 56:48.280]  So let's get back to the regular part of the show.
[56:48.280 --> 56:49.520]  Thanks for listening to Mark Emery.
[56:49.520 --> 56:51.120]  Support those guys.
[56:51.120 --> 56:52.600]  So, hey Adam, dude,
[56:52.600 --> 56:53.880]  you made it through a whole nother episode.
[56:53.880 --> 56:55.080]  Thanks for hanging out with me.
[56:55.080 --> 56:56.080]  Hey, thanks man.
[56:56.080 --> 56:58.040]  You make the episodes go a little bit smoother.
[56:58.040 --> 56:59.800]  It's better than me sitting here talking to myself
[56:59.800 --> 57:02.000]  and looking at the wall like I'm a schizophrenic.
[57:02.000 --> 57:02.840]  I appreciate it.
[57:02.840 --> 57:04.840]  And yeah, like always,
[57:05.840 --> 57:06.680]  anytime you need.
[57:07.760 --> 57:11.280]  Where can these guys find you on the Twitter?
[57:11.280 --> 57:13.120]  Over at Grow the Gov on Twitter.
[57:13.120 --> 57:16.960]  And then the website is 420F.com.
[57:16.960 --> 57:18.480]  I've never checked out that website guys.
[57:18.480 --> 57:19.520]  Games and fun.
[57:19.520 --> 57:21.040]  No, it's nothing bad.
[57:21.040 --> 57:22.440]  It's highly offensive, I apologize.
[57:22.440 --> 57:25.080]  You can find all of our Twitters and all that.
[57:25.080 --> 57:26.600]  Big shout out to my homie Bender.
[57:26.600 --> 57:28.280]  He's been working hard on the servers and stuff.
[57:28.280 --> 57:29.200]  We run game servers.
[57:29.200 --> 57:32.040]  So, you wanna come play some video games with Stoners?
[57:32.040 --> 57:32.880]  Come on.
[57:32.880 --> 57:33.840]  There you go.
[57:33.880 --> 57:36.120]  Who doesn't wanna play video games with Stoners?
[57:36.120 --> 57:39.440]  Guys, you can find me at I read genetics on Instagram,
[57:39.440 --> 57:41.160]  at I grow culture on Instagram,
[57:41.160 --> 57:43.000]  at I grow culture on Twitter.
[57:43.000 --> 57:45.320]  I grow culture has a Facebook.
[57:45.320 --> 57:46.200]  You can email us.
[57:46.200 --> 57:49.280]  It's I grow culture at hotmail.com.
[57:50.880 --> 57:52.840]  I gotta give a huge shout out to DJ Nickity.
[57:52.840 --> 57:54.640]  That's what's playing in the background.
[57:54.640 --> 57:55.480]  Big shout out.
[57:55.480 --> 57:57.720]  Thanks for letting me play the Summit Turn Up,
[57:57.720 --> 58:00.560]  the electronic dance hall music volume one.
[58:00.560 --> 58:02.920]  It's not even on the screen anymore and I remembered it.
[58:03.520 --> 58:05.040]  Much respect to DJ Nickity.
[58:05.040 --> 58:07.000]  Follow him on SoundCloud.
[58:07.000 --> 58:09.680]  And now that the show is over,
[58:09.680 --> 58:10.520]  or should I do this?
[58:10.520 --> 58:11.360]  Watch, just in case.
[58:11.360 --> 58:12.440]  All right, guys, and that was a little speech
[58:12.440 --> 58:13.280]  from Mark Emery.
[58:13.280 --> 58:14.640]  Thanks for listening to that.
[58:15.720 --> 58:17.400]  And if not, now that the show is over,
[58:17.400 --> 58:18.520]  please go to iTunes.
[58:18.520 --> 58:20.600]  Go to the iTunes store, search for I grow culture.
[58:20.600 --> 58:21.520]  Find the review section.
[58:21.520 --> 58:22.680]  Give us a five star rating.
[58:22.680 --> 58:23.800]  After that, type in a comment
[58:23.800 --> 58:25.280]  and let me know what you think of the show
[58:25.280 --> 58:27.280]  and I'll read your comments on the show.
[58:27.280 --> 58:29.040]  And I'm really serious about that.
[58:29.040 --> 58:30.400]  If you're listening to us on Stitcher,
[58:30.400 --> 58:31.800]  please leave a comment there
[58:31.800 --> 58:33.240]  and give us a good review.
[58:33.240 --> 58:35.600]  All of those reviews help the show move up in the rankings,
[58:35.600 --> 58:37.040]  which in turn get us more listeners.
[58:37.040 --> 58:39.200]  And I wanna spread my message to everyone
[58:39.200 --> 58:41.800]  who wants to grow and wants to learn more about cannabis.
[58:41.800 --> 58:44.560]  This is an important message to spread.
[58:44.560 --> 58:47.080]  Don't forget that the show is available on iTunes,
[58:47.080 --> 58:49.640]  Stitcher, and every single episode
[58:49.640 --> 58:53.560]  is on iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[58:53.560 --> 58:55.400]  Big huge shout out to my ninja Spence.
[58:55.400 --> 58:56.800]  Thanks again for listening, you guys.
[58:56.800 --> 58:59.360]  Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
