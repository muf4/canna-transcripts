[00:47.600 --> 00:50.120]  know, I like to start this podcast off by talking about
[00:50.120 --> 00:54.320]  what I'm smoking. Today. I've been taking dabs of cowboy cush
[00:54.440 --> 00:57.760]  full spectrum extract from green dot labs. This is a blend of
[00:57.800 --> 01:02.000]  ha og and stardog on the package. The flavor is described
[01:02.000 --> 01:05.800]  as earthy fuel and leather on the back. The potency label says
[01:05.800 --> 01:12.240]  the product does contain 64.88% THC. I am thoroughly satisfied
[01:12.280 --> 01:16.240]  and impressed with the cowboy cush full spectrum extract. This
[01:16.240 --> 01:20.680]  was a four gram jar. I say four gram jar because now it is a zero
[01:20.800 --> 01:24.680]  gram jar. It started off with big chunky diamonds, just the
[01:24.680 --> 01:28.200]  right amount of turp sauce. This was a beautiful presentation.
[01:28.320 --> 01:31.840]  The flavor and aroma were perfect. And the buzz was
[01:31.920 --> 01:34.640]  delicious. I feel like I'm sitting back in the chair. I'm
[01:34.640 --> 01:37.520]  kind of mellow. I'd like to go grab some snacks, but that would
[01:37.520 --> 01:40.520]  be a never ending process right now. So big shout out to our
[01:40.520 --> 01:45.000]  friends at green dot labs for the delicious cowboy cush full
[01:45.080 --> 01:48.720]  spectrum extract. Ladies and gentlemen, in this episode, I'm
[01:48.720 --> 01:52.040]  going to read some listener emails. Before we get there.
[01:52.200 --> 01:55.560]  Let's do some shout outs to a few of the folks who support the
[01:55.560 --> 01:59.760]  show on Patreon. Let's start off by giving a big shout out to my
[01:59.760 --> 02:03.680]  buddy Tanner M. Let's send a big shout out to my buddy Sour D. I

[02:25.000 --> 02:27.880]  thank you and a shout out to easy. Oh, five, seven. I know
[02:27.880 --> 02:31.440]  what that means, bro. And last but not least, let's send a big
[02:31.480 --> 02:34.640]  giant thank you shout out to my buddy. Oh, gee, purple thumb.

[02:58.680 --> 03:02.720]  of the support. And I did get a special email from a listener.
[03:02.960 --> 03:07.480]  And this one says, Yo, me and my buddy THC activator were able to
[03:07.480 --> 03:10.720]  put some pennies together to finally give back to you for all
[03:10.720 --> 03:13.840]  of the fucking awesome information and genetics. We
[03:13.840 --> 03:16.480]  just wanted to thank you and see if it would be possible you
[03:16.480 --> 03:19.240]  could give us both a shout out. That would be awesome. But if
[03:19.240 --> 03:23.480]  not, I understand. My name is G farms 401 on cannabis and my
[03:23.480 --> 03:27.840]  buddy is THC activator. Thanks again, brother. Well, hey, you
[03:27.840 --> 03:30.320]  guys, thank you for the Patreon contribution. Thank you for
[03:30.320 --> 03:32.960]  listening. Thank you for the great message. Big shout out to
[03:32.960 --> 03:37.640]  my friends G farms 401 and THC activator for the Patreon
[03:37.640 --> 03:41.480]  contributions and the continued love and support. I can't do it
[03:41.480 --> 03:44.320]  without friends like you. First of all, I need listeners. If I'm
[03:44.320 --> 03:47.560]  just up here talking that makes me crazy. You guys listening
[03:47.600 --> 03:51.120]  makes me not a psychopath. So thank you for that. And also the
[03:51.120 --> 03:54.400]  Patreon contributions. Those go a long way. That is how I keep
[03:54.400 --> 03:56.760]  all of the gear running the technical equipment lives
[03:56.920 --> 03:59.440]  through all of your contributions. Also, I pay for
[03:59.440 --> 04:02.120]  the website, I pay for the internet connection, I pay for
[04:02.120 --> 04:04.880]  these little fuzzy microphone covers. So without your love and
[04:04.880 --> 04:07.480]  Patreon support, it would not happen. Then the words of
[04:07.480 --> 04:11.160]  encouragement and the thank you that goes as far as the Patreon
[04:11.160 --> 04:13.800]  support. That means a lot to me people reaching out saying
[04:13.800 --> 04:17.000]  thank you giving me a high five, a digital virtual fist bump,
[04:17.000 --> 04:20.320]  excuse the throat clearing that was gross. But everybody
[04:20.320 --> 04:22.680]  reaching out showing me some love. That means a lot to me,
[04:22.680 --> 04:25.080]  you guys. Thank you. I do appreciate that. So big shout
[04:25.080 --> 04:27.120]  out once again, I'm gonna grab the paper and make sure I don't
[04:27.120 --> 04:30.640]  fuck it up. Big shout out to my friend G farms 401 on cannabis,
[04:30.640 --> 04:34.760]  give them a follow on cannabis and also our friend THC
[04:34.840 --> 04:38.560]  activator. Big love, big respect. Big thanks to everybody
[04:38.600 --> 04:41.520]  who does support the show. And while I'm dishing out thank
[04:41.520 --> 04:44.800]  yous, let's send a big thank you over to my buddy Mike for
[04:44.800 --> 04:48.040]  joining me on zoom on the last episode. That was a great time.
[04:48.200 --> 04:50.240]  I had a lot of fun. We had a great chat. We had a good
[04:50.240 --> 04:54.360]  hangout. Big thanks to everybody who listened to that episode. I
[04:54.360 --> 04:57.120]  was a good time doing two guys coughing. If you listen to the
[04:57.120 --> 04:59.840]  episode, you caught that joke. It was a great time. Thank you.
[04:59.880 --> 05:02.760]  And also thank you, Mike. Once again, bro. Let's do that again.
[05:02.920 --> 05:06.120]  And I want to get more people on my zoom show. We will do zoom
[05:06.120 --> 05:09.320]  shows and record the audio and release those as podcasts. When
[05:09.320 --> 05:14.080]  I get comfortable I do intend to do zoom videos. I apologize for
[05:14.080 --> 05:16.640]  the stuttering today. We're gonna blame that on the cowboy
[05:16.640 --> 05:20.440]  kush full spectrum extract. It's got me. My tongue got caught on
[05:20.440 --> 05:24.000]  my teeth and I could not see what I was saying. All right,
[05:24.080 --> 05:26.280]  ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be a fun episode. I'm
[05:26.280 --> 05:29.240]  in a good mood. I'm nice and stoned about a good day. It's
[05:29.240 --> 05:32.640]  nice weather. It's finally not cold. It was 60 something
[05:32.640 --> 05:35.440]  degrees today where I live. That may not be warm where you live.
[05:35.440 --> 05:38.200]  Quit showing off California where I live. That was super
[05:38.200 --> 05:40.880]  nice. It's going to start getting super nice really soon.
[05:41.120 --> 05:44.000]  And pretty soon they say they are going to lift the quarantine
[05:44.000 --> 05:47.120]  restrictions. I'm excited for that. I honestly don't know how
[05:47.120 --> 05:50.400]  excited I am to get back in public. I don't know it's mixed
[05:50.400 --> 05:53.280]  emotions. But just to know I'm allowed to go back outside and
[05:53.280 --> 05:56.600]  things may get normal again, has me feeling excited. Once I get
[05:56.600 --> 05:59.960]  out there. We'll see how my OCD and my germophobia really does
[05:59.960 --> 06:02.440]  with being out there in public again. I'm going to try not to
[06:02.440 --> 06:05.240]  talk too much about quarantine and COVID. We're just going to
[06:05.240 --> 06:08.320]  make a timestamp on this episode. I am recording this on
[06:09.000 --> 06:13.240]  Friday, April 24. We are currently like several days into
[06:13.240 --> 06:15.840]  a quarantine COVID situation. So if you're listening to this in
[06:15.840 --> 06:19.480]  the future, this was actually recorded during the COVID
[06:19.520 --> 06:22.800]  lockdown. It's fucking weird. It's just as weird as everybody
[06:22.800 --> 06:26.280]  said, but nothing too crazy has happened where I am. That's your
[06:26.280 --> 06:28.800]  timestamp. That's your historical moment. Let's move
[06:28.800 --> 06:32.120]  forward. The first email on today's episode comes from a
[06:32.120 --> 06:34.800]  longtime listener. I'm not sure if they want their name said,
[06:35.040 --> 06:37.840]  but the email, honestly, I printed the email out and this
[06:37.840 --> 06:41.280]  was the last print from that ink cartridge. So there are a few
[06:41.280 --> 06:44.280]  words missing the email is a little fuzzy on the paper, I can
[06:44.280 --> 06:48.080]  make out what it says. It goes something a little bit like
[06:48.080 --> 06:51.280]  this. It says hey, Ross to Jeff, I never miss an episode of the
[06:51.280 --> 06:54.200]  grow from your heart podcast and I usually catch the live feed
[06:54.240 --> 06:57.760]  every Monday night. Thank you. That means a lot to me. Every
[06:57.760 --> 07:01.480]  Monday night I do a live Instagram feed I go live 710
[07:01.560 --> 07:04.560]  mountain time. I usually hang out for about an hour. I talk
[07:04.560 --> 07:07.560]  about cannabis and I answer random questions. Join me if
[07:07.560 --> 07:09.880]  you're available. I'm I re underscore genetics on
[07:09.880 --> 07:13.160]  Instagram. Check out the live feed. This listener goes on to
[07:13.160 --> 07:16.640]  say I am a caregiver in Michigan and you have taught in the next
[07:16.640 --> 07:19.480]  sentence gets cut out. I'm gonna hope it says I have taught you a
[07:19.480 --> 07:21.960]  lot. I'm gonna hope it doesn't say that I've taught you anything
[07:21.960 --> 07:24.840]  terrible and taught you bad habits. But it does go on to say
[07:24.840 --> 07:28.640]  I have two quick questions on episode 523. You mentioned
[07:28.640 --> 07:33.120]  rosin wasn't your concentrate of choice. Why is that? I'm an old
[07:33.120 --> 07:36.200]  school flower smoker, but literally, then a lot of it
[07:36.200 --> 07:41.080]  gets cut out a full line, then I can read concentrate because the
[07:41.080 --> 07:44.720]  majority were being made using solvents, but it's hard to read
[07:44.720 --> 07:47.560]  that. But the next sentence says solvent free. I thought this was
[07:47.560 --> 07:50.280]  the best route to go. I'm new to all this and I thought I would
[07:50.280 --> 07:53.400]  really like to know the difference. Now I did read this
[07:53.400 --> 07:57.160]  email before I printed it. I think this listener does not have
[07:57.160 --> 07:59.920]  a lot of experience with concentrates and they are
[07:59.920 --> 08:02.960]  considering buying a rosin press because that is a very
[08:03.000 --> 08:06.200]  affordable and efficient way to make concentrates at home. It is
[08:06.200 --> 08:09.960]  also very safe. So they were considering purchasing a rosin
[08:09.960 --> 08:14.280]  press is what I do believe if I'm correct. So they're asking
[08:14.280 --> 08:18.880]  why I have said that rosin is not my favorite concentrate. I do
[08:18.880 --> 08:24.000]  not prefer rosin. I like BHO concentrates. I like full
[08:24.000 --> 08:26.840]  spectrum extracts. I like batters. Those are what I
[08:26.840 --> 08:31.280]  prefer. That is not made with rosin. I think the rosin tastes
[08:31.480 --> 08:34.840]  a little bit funky to me. It always has a hint of a burnt
[08:34.840 --> 08:38.440]  popsicle sort of a flavor. I do have one friend who makes
[08:38.440 --> 08:42.160]  quality rosin but it is quite an extensive process. He makes
[08:42.360 --> 08:46.280]  bubble hash out of fresh frozen. I may be inaccurate on some of
[08:46.280 --> 08:49.240]  these statements, some of these details. I believe he is fresh
[08:49.240 --> 08:52.720]  freezing concentrate, making bubble hash out of that, then
[08:52.720 --> 08:56.600]  fresh freezing or freeze drying the concentrate. Then he is
[08:56.600 --> 09:00.480]  making pressed rosin from that concentrate. So there are a lot
[09:00.480 --> 09:04.480]  more steps when you remove the vegetative part, the flour part
[09:04.480 --> 09:09.600]  from the press, it makes things taste much better. Sorry, that
[09:09.600 --> 09:13.520]  was hard for my face to say. The process of squishing raw flour,
[09:13.600 --> 09:16.520]  it makes the final product taste much better. I don't think you
[09:16.520 --> 09:19.480]  get as much of that burnt popcorn flavor if you actually
[09:19.480 --> 09:22.560]  press bubble hash. If you make hash out of it, then press the
[09:22.560 --> 09:25.320]  bubble hash. It's a whole other step. It's a whole another
[09:25.320 --> 09:29.000]  process. It's a lot more work, but it really drastically
[09:29.000 --> 09:31.960]  improves the quality of the concentrate. So if you're going
[09:31.960 --> 09:36.680]  to make rosin, I recommend you follow Pedro's Grow Room on
[09:36.720 --> 09:40.200]  Instagram and on YouTube. He teaches a lot of great
[09:40.200 --> 09:43.760]  techniques on making high quality rosin. It is not my
[09:43.760 --> 09:46.960]  favorite unless Pedro makes it. I would not buy rosin from
[09:46.960 --> 09:50.040]  anybody but Pedro, hypothetically if he were to make
[09:50.040 --> 09:54.000]  some available. So I am not a huge fan of rosin. That is my
[09:54.000 --> 09:57.240]  personal preference. There are thousands of people out there
[09:57.320 --> 10:00.400]  who really love rosin. It's just not for me. I like to smoke
[10:00.400 --> 10:04.400]  BHO. I like sauce and diamonds. I really prefer the batters
[10:04.400 --> 10:07.880]  lately. Something about a nice batter, a green dot batter, a
[10:07.880 --> 10:10.920]  good apothecary batter, just a nice dollop in the middle of the
[10:10.920 --> 10:13.440]  container. It's got a nice texture to it, a good flavor.
[10:13.440 --> 10:16.120]  And when you hit it, there's something it does in the lungs.
[10:16.120 --> 10:19.400]  It has a nice expansion. It feels smooth. I can get a big
[10:19.400 --> 10:23.000]  fat hit. It tastes real nice. I don't have any hatred toward
[10:23.000 --> 10:27.960]  rosin. It is just not for me. I think that what's a food that I
[10:27.960 --> 10:29.760]  don't like? I can't even think of a food I don't like because
[10:29.760 --> 10:32.960]  I'll eat freaking anything. I'm a vegetarian. So we'll just say
[10:33.040 --> 10:35.680]  steak isn't there's nothing wrong with it. It's just not for
[10:35.680 --> 10:39.240]  me. You guys that eat steak do that. Rosin is steak. It's just
[10:39.240 --> 10:41.920]  not for me. I'd prefer to have something different. So that's
[10:41.920 --> 10:44.920]  my comparison. Just personal preference. I don't think it
[10:44.920 --> 10:48.720]  tastes good. It hits hard and it gets me high. It's just not my
[10:48.760 --> 10:51.720]  favorite thing. So that's a long rant on that. Then there is a
[10:51.720 --> 10:56.120]  part two of this question. It says, another grower podcast had
[10:56.120 --> 10:59.920]  a quick video a couple of months ago about pH and said you
[10:59.920 --> 11:05.160]  always need to put your pH down or pH up in water to dilute that
[11:05.160 --> 11:08.960]  solution before adding it to your nutrient reservoir. Because
[11:08.960 --> 11:11.720]  if you dump it straight in with your nudes, and then again, the
[11:11.720 --> 11:14.480]  sentence gets cut out. But I'm going to say there's a risk of a
[11:14.480 --> 11:19.000]  chemical reaction or that acid or base in your pH balancing
[11:19.000 --> 11:22.960]  solution could possibly disrupt the nutrients that you just put
[11:23.000 --> 11:28.040]  into that mix. I understand why they could say that that is a
[11:28.040 --> 11:32.160]  very, that's almost too much detail to worry about. I don't
[11:32.160 --> 11:35.200]  think that's going to be a thing. Most folks are going to
[11:35.200 --> 11:38.960]  be mixing maybe a cap full of pH up or pH down into their
[11:38.960 --> 11:41.000]  solution. You've got a five gallon bucket, you're putting
[11:41.000 --> 11:45.040]  very little pH pH down in there. I don't think it's going to be
[11:45.040 --> 11:49.120]  enough chemical to cause any problem at that rate. The
[11:49.120 --> 11:52.240]  nutrients you've already added to that water are chelated and
[11:52.240 --> 11:54.560]  buffered. They're protected basically from that other
[11:54.560 --> 11:57.680]  chemical reaction you're putting in there. I'm not a chemist. I'm
[11:57.680 --> 12:01.040]  not a scientist, but I don't think that those products are
[12:01.040 --> 12:05.600]  powerful enough to cause any damage in small dilutions. Now
[12:05.600 --> 12:09.200]  in a commercial environment, we're putting 100 milliliters
[12:09.200 --> 12:14.120]  250 mils of pH down in a solution at a time that may need
[12:14.120 --> 12:17.240]  to be diluted. That could be a good idea to dilute that with a
[12:17.240 --> 12:20.760]  cup of water, then pour that in. When you're going with larger
[12:20.760 --> 12:24.280]  batches, that may really be helpful. But for the basic home
[12:24.280 --> 12:27.680]  grower, and a small batch of nutrients with a small mix, I
[12:27.680 --> 12:30.400]  don't think it would be necessary. But if you've got
[12:30.400 --> 12:34.000]  crazy OCD and you want to be extra detailed, that could be a
[12:34.000 --> 12:37.080]  thing that you could do. It could not hurt, but I don't find
[12:37.080 --> 12:40.680]  it to be absolutely necessary for the small grow environment.
[12:40.840 --> 12:44.120]  Keep in mind, I did preface that by saying zero chemistry
[12:44.120 --> 12:46.600]  experience. I have zero chemistry knowledge. I don't
[12:46.600 --> 12:49.560]  have any papers that say I'm good at chemistry. So I'm not
[12:49.560 --> 12:52.160]  really qualified to give that answer. I'm just telling you
[12:52.160 --> 12:55.800]  that I've never seen a problem in the thousands if not millions
[12:55.800 --> 12:58.840]  of fucking batches of nutrients I've mixed. So I want to thank
[12:58.840 --> 13:00.880]  you for sending a great email. I think we've been chatting a
[13:00.880 --> 13:03.680]  little bit corresponding through email. I think I've answered a
[13:03.680 --> 13:05.880]  couple of your questions. You may have actually supported me a
[13:05.880 --> 13:09.200]  little bit. So I thank you for all the love and support. I do
[13:09.200 --> 13:11.400]  know your name. I don't know if you want it said on the show.
[13:11.520 --> 13:13.960]  But thank you. I do appreciate the great message. If you have
[13:13.960 --> 13:17.760]  more questions, please send them my way. I will get them on the
[13:17.760 --> 13:20.600]  show. If I don't get them on the show. I'll answer privately.
[13:20.680 --> 13:23.640]  Thank you for the support. If anybody else out there has a
[13:23.640 --> 13:27.680]  question, my email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[13:27.880 --> 13:30.880]  I would love to get your listener generated cannabis
[13:30.880 --> 13:34.600]  cultivation or cannabis culture question here on the show. You
[13:34.600 --> 13:37.400]  guys that cowboy cush has got me fucked up. I'm talkative today.
[13:37.560 --> 13:40.480]  Let's keep flowing. We've got a couple of great questions. Which
[13:40.480 --> 13:42.280]  one are we going to do first? They're both right here in front
[13:42.280 --> 13:45.920]  of me. This one is going to work well. It says Rasta Jeff. I
[13:45.920 --> 13:48.600]  appreciate all of your knowledge on the podcast. I have a quick
[13:48.600 --> 13:52.200]  question about carbon filters. Very good question. You guys.
[13:52.400 --> 13:55.720]  How often do you recommend changing the whole filter? I've
[13:55.720 --> 13:59.440]  changed out the dust filter but I've noticed a little PM and the
[13:59.440 --> 14:02.640]  humidity is starting to rise a bit. I've been using it for a
[14:02.640 --> 14:06.280]  year. They have to be replaced or just the outer dust filter.
[14:06.520 --> 14:09.120]  The smell has been in check but I'm a little bit concerned with
[14:09.120 --> 14:12.600]  the PM. I just added a fan in the corner and ordered a new
[14:12.600 --> 14:16.560]  clip on oscillating fan. Prior to that, I only had one small
[14:16.560 --> 14:20.320]  clip on fan. Maybe I just need more airflow. I'm in a four by
[14:20.320 --> 14:24.160]  four and the relative excuse me the relative humidity has been
[14:24.160 --> 14:27.360]  50 to 60%. You're a little bit high there. We need to lower
[14:27.360 --> 14:31.520]  that humidity. The temps are around 72 with lights on 60 with
[14:31.520 --> 14:35.800]  the lights off. I'm running two Mars TS 1000 LEDs. Thank you,
[14:35.800 --> 14:38.720]  Jeff from AJ. All right, there are a few things we need to
[14:38.720 --> 14:42.360]  address here in this question. Yes, you do need to replace that
[14:42.360 --> 14:46.040]  carbon filter. I think the manufacturer recommends every
[14:46.120 --> 14:49.160]  two years. I don't know how much air you're running through
[14:49.160 --> 14:51.880]  there. I don't know what size blower you purchased. I don't
[14:51.880 --> 14:54.240]  know what size carbon filter you've got. I don't know how big
[14:54.240 --> 14:58.560]  the room is. I don't know other environmental factors to put
[14:58.560 --> 15:02.760]  into my brain equation here. I don't know how much stank and
[15:02.760 --> 15:06.240]  dust and dirt and pollen and powdery mildew and humidity have
[15:06.240 --> 15:10.040]  gone through that filter. Most manufacturers say 18 to 28 I
[15:10.040 --> 15:12.440]  think it's 26. What's the fucking 18 to 30 months I'm
[15:12.440 --> 15:15.560]  trying to do math in my head. They say one and a half to two
[15:15.560 --> 15:18.400]  and a half years they recommend about a two year change. You're
[15:18.400 --> 15:21.280]  saying that so it is time to change it probably because
[15:21.280 --> 15:23.600]  you've got a lot of other factors. You've had powdery
[15:23.600 --> 15:27.480]  mildew in there. The humidity is raising. The humidity will
[15:27.560 --> 15:31.320]  lessen the effectiveness and lifelong the longevity of your
[15:31.320 --> 15:34.320]  filter. You've also had powdery mildew. I would consider
[15:34.320 --> 15:37.240]  swapping out that filter just because of the powdery mildew. I
[15:37.240 --> 15:39.720]  know it's going into there and then going out. But I don't know
[15:39.720 --> 15:42.200]  powdery mildew that makes me paranoid. I wouldn't want to get
[15:42.200 --> 15:45.640]  that again. So it is probably time or close to time to
[15:45.640 --> 15:48.240]  changing out that filter. If it's in the budget. It is
[15:48.240 --> 15:50.960]  something I would consider. Now you said that you had powdery
[15:50.960 --> 15:54.520]  mildew. Also, you asked about the outer filter. If that thing
[15:54.520 --> 15:58.520]  is dirty, give it one clean with oxy clean, rinse it out one time
[15:58.560 --> 16:00.920]  put it back the next time it gets dirty. That is generally
[16:00.920 --> 16:03.960]  when I say that it's time to replace the filter. If it's
[16:03.960 --> 16:06.360]  getting that much dust in it and showing you that it's getting
[16:06.360 --> 16:09.400]  really dirty on the inside. It's probably going to stop taking
[16:09.400 --> 16:12.680]  out the smell real well. You say it doesn't stink. That's your
[16:12.680 --> 16:15.240]  grow. You also don't think your armpits stink when your
[16:15.240 --> 16:17.240]  girlfriend leans on you and goes God, you need a fucking
[16:17.240 --> 16:20.680]  shower. We don't notice some smells. We get nose blind to
[16:20.680 --> 16:23.680]  certain things. Bring somebody new into the house and see if
[16:23.680 --> 16:25.840]  they notice that grow. That's how you know if the filter
[16:25.840 --> 16:29.320]  works. Bring the landlord over see if they notice. That's how
[16:29.320 --> 16:32.440]  you know if the carbon filter works. Now, we've talked about
[16:32.440 --> 16:35.280]  changing out the filter. That dust cover needs to be clean,
[16:35.280 --> 16:37.840]  needs to be replaced, needs to be put back on, run it again.
[16:38.000 --> 16:40.240]  Check for smell. If you're confident that there's no smell
[16:40.240 --> 16:42.920]  you may be okay. I'm concerned with the powdery mildew in
[16:42.920 --> 16:44.760]  there. That may be all right. I don't think you're going to blow
[16:44.760 --> 16:47.920]  it back out. It just makes me worried. Keep things clean. It
[16:47.920 --> 16:50.320]  shouldn't smell. If you smell it, swap it out. Now, what has
[16:50.320 --> 16:53.720]  me concerned, you said that the humidity is high and what you
[16:53.720 --> 16:57.760]  have done to fix the powdery mildew is to add a fan. A fan
[16:57.760 --> 17:00.880]  is a good start, but that is not going to lower the humidity.
[17:00.880 --> 17:04.120]  We need a way to remove the humidity from the room. That can
[17:04.120 --> 17:06.840]  be done through an exhaust fan by sucking the air up through the
[17:06.840 --> 17:10.720]  top of the tent. That can be done by placing a dehumidifier
[17:10.760 --> 17:14.080]  in the actual tent. I don't think that a fan is going to
[17:14.080 --> 17:17.360]  solve the powdery mildew problem. It will slow it down.
[17:17.520 --> 17:20.080]  It will make it longer. It will make it take longer to appear.
[17:20.080 --> 17:23.360]  But I don't think it's going to be the solution. Find a way to
[17:23.360 --> 17:27.000]  lower that humidity. 50% to 60% when you get into flower is
[17:27.000 --> 17:29.920]  going to be ridiculous. You're also going to have more
[17:29.920 --> 17:32.760]  vegetation in the room at that time. You'll have big buds,
[17:32.760 --> 17:35.040]  you'll have more leaves, you'll be watering more frequently,
[17:35.280 --> 17:38.120]  you're going to have more opportunity and more reason for
[17:38.120 --> 17:41.480]  powdery mildew to pop up. I recommend some way to get that
[17:41.480 --> 17:44.400]  humidity out of there. I also recommend maybe a harder
[17:44.400 --> 17:47.960]  defoliation. That should do it for you. Defoliate, take some
[17:47.960 --> 17:51.080]  leaves out of there, and then just learn how to lessen the
[17:51.080 --> 17:54.080]  humidity overall in the room. Exhaust at the top,
[17:54.200 --> 17:57.480]  dehumidifier, something like that is going to be required. So
[17:57.480 --> 18:00.040]  you do need to replace that filter. I would say about a
[18:00.040 --> 18:03.560]  year, 18 months in, I don't go over two years. Of course, I
[18:03.560 --> 18:06.840]  grow super stinky weed. I've got just the right size filter,
[18:06.840 --> 18:10.960]  the appropriate size blower. So that lasts about 18, 18 months,
[18:10.960 --> 18:14.720]  two years, you're going to want to reduce your humidity for that
[18:14.720 --> 18:18.360]  powdery mildew will keep coming back. It sounds like we got you
[18:18.360 --> 18:21.600]  figured out bro. You've got that clip on fan and another fan, and
[18:21.600 --> 18:25.320]  maybe time to add an exhaust fan to the top of the grow tank.
[18:25.520 --> 18:28.280]  I want to thank my friend AJ for the great grow question. You
[18:28.280 --> 18:30.120]  guys, I'm going to take a quick drink of some water here. I'm
[18:30.120 --> 18:33.040]  not going to press pause. Please bear with me, you folks on the
[18:33.040 --> 18:35.320]  video. If the video ever comes out, you get to watch me take a
[18:35.320 --> 18:38.720]  sip. So here we go. Take an equip sit quick sip. Join me
[18:38.920 --> 18:40.080]  hydrate motherfuckers.
[18:49.730 --> 18:51.970]  Well, I needed that more than I realized that was pretty damn
[18:51.970 --> 18:56.410]  refreshing. Drink some water you guys. All right, I've got another
[18:56.410 --> 18:59.650]  message here in front of me. Let me get my shit together. This
[18:59.650 --> 19:03.410]  one goes a lot like this. It starts off with Hey, Jeff.
[19:03.570 --> 19:06.770]  Firstly, sorry for the loss of your uncle. Hey, thank you. I
[19:06.770 --> 19:09.810]  appreciate the condolences. I appreciate the support. I miss
[19:09.810 --> 19:13.170]  my uncle. Thank you for the love. It goes on to say, I just
[19:13.170 --> 19:16.570]  wanted to share some pictures of my lemon Jeffrey and ask you a
[19:16.570 --> 19:19.610]  co2 question. I did look at the pictures and your plants look
[19:19.610 --> 19:23.130]  great. You guys out there in podcast land. Imagine some
[19:23.130 --> 19:25.850]  beautiful lemon Jeffrey plants. They're fucking perfect. Now,
[19:26.050 --> 19:29.130]  we'll keep going. It says, I'm absolutely loving the podcast. I
[19:29.130 --> 19:32.690]  think you're doing a fantastic job educating your listeners and
[19:32.690 --> 19:36.090]  helping us focus on things to help us all become better
[19:36.090 --> 19:38.570]  growers during these difficult times. That's awesome, dude.
[19:38.570 --> 19:42.930]  Thank you. Now it says first question is about co2 during the
[19:42.930 --> 19:47.050]  vegetative state. Is there any benefit to running co2 during
[19:47.050 --> 19:51.570]  veg? Yes, running co2 during veg will make your plants grow more
[19:51.570 --> 19:54.290]  quickly, you'll get more rapid growth, you'll get better use of
[19:54.290 --> 19:57.170]  your nutrients, you're feeding the plants, high quality
[19:57.170 --> 19:59.970]  nutrients, hopefully we've got them under high quality lighting.
[20:00.130 --> 20:04.330]  If you can afford it in the room is designed properly. Yes, co2
[20:04.450 --> 20:07.770]  will absolutely increase the performance of your plants right
[20:07.770 --> 20:11.650]  now. General atmospheric conditions are approximately 400
[20:11.650 --> 20:16.290]  ppm of co2 particles per million of co2 depending on where you
[20:16.290 --> 20:20.650]  are, that could be more or less about 50 ppm more 50 ppm less
[20:20.650 --> 20:23.810]  based on your location, your altitude will have something to
[20:23.810 --> 20:26.810]  do with that. But generally, we're sitting about 400
[20:26.810 --> 20:30.650]  particles per million of co2 in the general atmosphere, our
[20:30.650 --> 20:34.370]  plants can eat much greater volumes of co2 than that,
[20:34.410 --> 20:37.450]  they'll get a much higher performance environment going
[20:37.450 --> 20:40.490]  on, you'll see it if you do it, they'll notice. So I'm gonna
[20:40.490 --> 20:42.490]  keep going because I'm rambling, I want to get myself back on
[20:42.490 --> 20:46.210]  track. It says, my second question is how much and for how
[20:46.210 --> 20:50.170]  long do I run co2? This is my first attempt at running co2.
[20:50.370 --> 20:52.970]  I've started on day one of flower, okay, I would have done
[20:52.970 --> 20:55.290]  it in veg, but you started in flower, you're putting them into
[20:55.290 --> 20:59.610]  turbocharged. That's cool. It says, my setup consists of a
[20:59.810 --> 21:03.610]  five by four tent with a high output forevergreen indoor
[21:03.730 --> 21:07.250]  uniformity pro led I'm not familiar with that light sounds
[21:07.250 --> 21:10.890]  fancy. If it's working for you. That's awesome. I know what size
[21:10.890 --> 21:14.410]  tent that is. It says I'm running two five gallon rain
[21:14.410 --> 21:17.530]  science air pots with pro mix and nectar of the gods. This is
[21:17.570 --> 21:21.090]  all making sense so far. I've got an autopilot co2 meter and
[21:21.090 --> 21:24.970]  controller. I said it 1200 ppm that is going to work well for
[21:24.970 --> 21:29.010]  you. That will work my tent runs around 80 to 85 degrees with RH
[21:29.010 --> 21:32.530]  around 60. You might want to reduce that RH just a little bit
[21:33.050 --> 21:36.530]  during lights on AC infinity fans handle the exhaust I have
[21:36.530 --> 21:39.810]  two oscillating fans and two stationary fans in the tent.
[21:40.250 --> 21:42.970]  Should I run the co2 until harvest or is this a waste and
[21:42.970 --> 21:46.450]  it's 1200 too much too little or just right. All right, there are
[21:46.450 --> 21:49.850]  a couple of things to talk about in that you were doing it
[21:49.850 --> 21:53.970]  correctly, I would reduce the overall humidity. And I think if
[21:53.970 --> 21:58.210]  you've got the LEDs 80 to 85 maybe cool. The oscillating fans
[21:58.210 --> 22:01.930]  and stationary fans are cool. Should I run it till harvest?
[22:01.930 --> 22:04.450]  Yes, I would run it right up until the day of harvest. You
[22:04.450 --> 22:08.050]  are not wasting it at that point. 1200 is good. 14 is good.
[22:08.050 --> 22:11.970]  16 is when you're kind of pushing it. 1600 ppm is that's
[22:11.970 --> 22:14.530]  when you're kind of maybe wasting it 14. You're like, Oh,
[22:14.530 --> 22:18.370]  yeah, 1200 is great. Um, there's something that got my attention,
[22:18.370 --> 22:21.290]  though. Where is it? There's a line and exhaust fan. Let me
[22:21.290 --> 22:26.890]  read back my AC infinity fans handle the exhaust. My question
[22:26.890 --> 22:30.690]  is, are you exhausting out your co2? Are you wasting your co2
[22:30.690 --> 22:33.850]  with that exhaust process? You've got a very small
[22:33.850 --> 22:37.010]  environment. It's not going to take a lot of air movement to
[22:37.010 --> 22:41.650]  exhaust out all of the co2 you were generating. So is the co2
[22:41.650 --> 22:46.450]  in the tent? Are you exhausting that tent into a room? How big
[22:46.490 --> 22:50.250]  is that room? How much co2 is happening in that room? Are we
[22:50.250 --> 22:56.210]  able to cycle that co2 back into the tent? If you have got co2
[22:56.210 --> 23:00.730]  happening, and you can minimize the humidity, I may reduce the
[23:00.770 --> 23:05.450]  exhaust fans and not run them or run them very minimally. Because
[23:05.450 --> 23:08.170]  you don't want to keep sucking out that co2. It's expensive.
[23:08.170 --> 23:10.530]  You don't want to keep going and buying tanks or whatever you're
[23:10.530 --> 23:14.970]  doing to generate the co2. I would think of cost effective
[23:14.970 --> 23:18.170]  ways to set this up. I don't know what your full environment
[23:18.170 --> 23:20.890]  is. I don't know where the tent is located. But are you wasting
[23:20.890 --> 23:23.810]  co2 by pumping it right out of the tent? Every time your
[23:23.810 --> 23:26.930]  exhaust fan comes on? Hopefully it's going into a bedroom and
[23:26.930 --> 23:29.970]  office the spare room, whatever. And hopefully it's just drawing
[23:29.970 --> 23:32.730]  that right back in. Maybe it mixes with the atmosphere and
[23:32.730 --> 23:34.850]  the rest of the room and it can come back in you get a little
[23:34.850 --> 23:38.130]  fresh air with it. I'm not sure but if you're pumping co2 you
[23:38.130 --> 23:41.810]  can turn off the exhaust fans as long as the heat and humidity
[23:41.810 --> 23:45.010]  don't get too high. So that's a juggle a balancing act, you're
[23:45.010 --> 23:47.730]  gonna have to dial in there. But it sounds like you're doing
[23:47.730 --> 23:52.130]  things correctly. You've got the meter, the controller, it sounds
[23:52.130 --> 23:55.650]  like you're doing it right. Now as long as the co2 goes off when
[23:55.650 --> 23:59.050]  the lights go off, I think everything will be cool. But my
[23:59.050 --> 24:01.850]  advice is to make sure you are running that correctly that
[24:01.850 --> 24:04.250]  you're not sucking it all out with your exhaust because that
[24:04.250 --> 24:07.970]  will get very expensive. It says feel free to share my pictures
[24:07.970 --> 24:10.650]  if you choose to use the question on the show. And also
[24:10.650 --> 24:13.050]  feel free to use my name. All right, big shout out to my
[24:13.050 --> 24:15.930]  friend sour D bro, you're killing it with that lemon
[24:15.930 --> 24:21.530]  Jeffrey. I hope I answered your co2 question. 1200 is good 14 is
[24:21.530 --> 24:25.490]  high 16 is fucking really high 18 is when people go What are
[24:25.490 --> 24:28.330]  you doing, bro? So you're right in the right ballpark. You were
[24:28.330 --> 24:31.970]  doing it correctly. Do it while the lights are on. Turn the co2
[24:31.970 --> 24:35.770]  off when the lights go off. And I do recommend using it at the
[24:35.770 --> 24:39.410]  vegetative stage. I generally start co2 kind of low six or
[24:39.410 --> 24:43.130]  800 ppm and veg and then about every week I increase a little
[24:43.130 --> 24:46.090]  bit until we're into that beefy bloom stage. And then you'll
[24:46.090 --> 24:50.010]  notice the performance increase and take notes, write down how
[24:50.010 --> 24:52.890]  much you're paying for the co2 and how often you buy it and
[24:52.890 --> 24:55.570]  then see how much performance increase you get at the end you
[24:55.570 --> 24:58.810]  get a better harvest you get more yield. Was it worth it? Do
[24:58.810 --> 25:01.570]  it two or three times and find out if it's worth that extra
[25:01.570 --> 25:05.290]  trip to the store, the extra equipment, the extra effort, see
[25:05.370 --> 25:08.330]  the extra money, see if it's actually worth it. All right,
[25:08.330 --> 25:11.130]  that's our deal. And thank you for a great message. If you've
[25:11.130 --> 25:15.770]  got any more questions, please send me another email. All
[25:15.770 --> 25:18.170]  right, I've got one more message here. And this one says
