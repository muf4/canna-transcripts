[00:00.250 --> 00:05.730]  Hey, welcome back. It's time for episode 414 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast. This
[00:05.730 --> 00:10.290]  show is brought to you by our friends at Oregon Elite Seeds. It is time to add fresh genetics
[00:10.290 --> 00:18.890]  to your garden and you can find them at www.oregoneliteseeds.com. Don't forget that Oregon Elite Seeds will
[00:18.890 --> 00:24.250]  have the first drop, the first release of the brand new Blue Raspberry Truffles that
[00:24.250 --> 00:28.850]  will be available at Oregon Elite Seeds on 420, so don't miss that.
[00:29.450 --> 00:33.730]  It has become a tradition that we start this podcast off by talking about what I am smoking.
[00:33.730 --> 00:38.850]  Today, I've been dabbing on Lemon G Batter from Apothecary Farms. The label says this
[00:38.850 --> 00:46.770]  has 68.5% THC and 79.1% total cannabinoids. I'm cracking it open now so I can get a fresh
[00:46.770 --> 00:51.590]  smell to give you an accurate description. At first waft as I wave the container past
[00:51.590 --> 00:57.130]  my nose, it is oranges, lemons, and candy. It is really pungent on the lemon side. The
[00:57.130 --> 01:01.090]  candy comes in there, there's a hint of oranges in the background. Then as the container gets
[01:01.090 --> 01:06.690]  closer to my face, it brings out a garlic and onion and armpit sort of a thing. This
[01:06.690 --> 01:11.890]  may sound crazy, but it is deliciously disgusting. It is something you put in front of your nose
[01:11.890 --> 01:16.010]  and you go, ooh, that is gross. Ooh, wait, bring that back. Ooh, that's so gross. Let
[01:16.010 --> 01:21.170]  me smell that again. Ooh, I like that. It's really, really deliciously disgusting. I can't
[01:21.170 --> 01:26.450]  stop dabbing it. I really love it. The high from this stuff is obviously tremendous because
[01:26.450 --> 01:30.770]  I can't quit talking or talking about the concentrate itself. It feels like it goes
[01:30.770 --> 01:35.330]  straight to my head. It feels like I kind of have maybe like a little bit of pressure
[01:35.330 --> 01:39.250]  right above my eyebrows kind of squeezing in on my temples a little bit. It's got me
[01:39.250 --> 01:43.130]  kind of in the zone. It's got a little bit of tunnel vision going on to it. It is obviously
[01:43.130 --> 01:48.570]  great podcasting concentrate because I cannot stop talking. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and
[01:48.570 --> 01:55.770]  girls, 420 is quickly approaching and I want to know what does 420 mean to you? On a previous
[01:56.090 --> 02:00.210]  episode, I asked, what does 420 mean to you? Somebody replied and they said, do you mean
[02:00.210 --> 02:04.490]  what is 420 the number mean? What does the date mean? What does the time mean to me?
[02:04.490 --> 02:09.650]  And I said, I want to know what does 420 mean to you? When I say, hey, 420, what does that
[02:09.650 --> 02:14.650]  spark in your mind? I would love to know what 420 means to you. Send me an email. My email
[02:14.650 --> 02:19.310]  address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com. I would love to hear from you, or you can
[02:19.310 --> 02:25.530]  reach out to me on Twitter. On Twitter, it is at GFYHpodcast. Tell me what does 420 mean
[02:25.570 --> 02:31.570]  to you and I will include that in my 420 celebration episode that I am putting together now.
[02:31.570 --> 02:36.410]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, in this episode, I am going to read a couple of listener emails,
[02:36.410 --> 02:41.970]  but before we get that far, let's do a few shout outs from Patreon. How about a giant
[02:41.970 --> 02:45.970]  shout out to my friend Richard Goals? Let's give a big shout out to Ryan Schmidt. I owe
[02:45.970 --> 02:50.610]  a giant shout out to Brett Gorman. Always a big shout out to Todd K. Of course, a big
[02:50.610 --> 02:55.410]  shout out to Steve F. And last but not least, I want to give a big shout out to my friend
[02:55.410 --> 03:00.610]  Remy Redeye. Big giant thanks to everybody for all of the Patreon support. And if you
[03:00.610 --> 03:05.850]  would like to learn how to become a patron, all you need to do is go to patreon.com slash
[03:05.850 --> 03:09.810]  growfromyourheart. All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[03:09.810 --> 03:14.410]  A big thanks to everybody who has helped out on Patreon in the past, in the present, and
[03:14.410 --> 03:18.450]  of course, in the future. All right, ladies and gentlemen, I did say that we have a couple
[03:18.450 --> 03:23.610]  of emails to read. I am reaching over to the email pile to get the first victim. Let's
[03:23.610 --> 03:28.570]  start with this one right here on top of the stack. And this one goes just like this.
[03:28.570 --> 03:33.010]  Greetings, Rasta Jeff. I initially heard you on the Dude Grow Show, so I thought I would
[03:33.010 --> 03:38.290]  check out your podcast. I've been diving deep and I'm really loving all of the great knowledge
[03:38.290 --> 03:42.370]  you're putting out there for everyone. Hey, first off, I am really honored to have been
[03:42.370 --> 03:46.890]  a guest on the Dude Grow Show. That really helped out build my audience. So big thanks
[03:46.890 --> 03:52.130]  to the Dude, big thanks to Scotty, big thanks to Guru, big thanks to JR Token, big thanks
[03:52.130 --> 03:55.930]  to Maestro, big shout out to everybody in front of the cameras and behind the scenes
[03:55.930 --> 04:00.490]  at the Dude Grow Show. They treat me like royalty. The Dude Grows crew treated me like
[04:00.490 --> 04:04.410]  royalty at the Dude Grows Cup. So I've got nothing but love and respect for everybody
[04:04.410 --> 04:08.290]  that is part of the DGC. And also, man, I'm glad that you're diving deep into the show.
[04:08.290 --> 04:11.690]  I like it when somebody discovers us and they go deep and start listening to all of the
[04:11.690 --> 04:16.970]  old episodes. It's a little embarrassing, honestly, but it is a time capsule and I'm
[04:16.970 --> 04:20.090]  proud of it. So I'm glad you were listening to the old stuff. And I love that you are
[04:20.090 --> 04:23.770]  finding knowledge and that you are appreciating it. So you're already pushing all the right
[04:23.770 --> 04:27.730]  buttons. This is a great message. He continues to say, there's something for everyone from
[04:27.730 --> 04:31.370]  the newbie all the way to the ones that think they know everything already. And that is
[04:31.370 --> 04:36.570]  the goal. So thank you for noticing. Also, the quality is top notch, which is always
[04:36.570 --> 04:40.450]  welcome. Keep up all the great work and knowledge. Hey, thanks a lot for that. That is a great
[04:40.490 --> 04:45.610]  way to start an email. There is more. It goes on to say, I also had a question that I wanted
[04:45.610 --> 04:51.130]  to ask a real deal grower, not a grower that is about passing on bad or misguided knowledge.
[04:51.130 --> 04:55.250]  Hey, I appreciate that you know I am all about doing a little bit of research and not trying
[04:55.250 --> 04:59.130]  to pass on bullshit knowledge because that frustrates the crap out of me. If you listen
[04:59.130 --> 05:03.410]  to the last episode, we had to correct a couple of errors or misinformation that people were
[05:03.410 --> 05:07.090]  given and that is kind of what I'm here for. I want to spread the truth. I want to encourage
[05:07.090 --> 05:11.250]  everybody to be positive about cannabis. So thanks for noticing that. There's more
[05:11.250 --> 05:15.250]  to that. He says, since you always say to shoot you any questions, I do. I encourage
[05:15.250 --> 05:19.370]  all of the questions. It creates amazing content for listeners. I know that I'm helping somebody
[05:19.370 --> 05:23.090]  by reading your message right now. I am at least helping you. So that means a lot to
[05:23.090 --> 05:27.450]  me. If you have this question, that means there are probably 20 other people out there
[05:27.450 --> 05:32.090]  that have this same question. So I'm helping you and hopefully a lot of other people with
[05:32.090 --> 05:36.650]  this great listener generated content. I am super rambly from those lemon G dabs. Let's
[05:36.650 --> 05:41.370]  try to keep me focused. Here we go. Here is the question. So I grow in cocoa with an
[05:41.370 --> 05:46.130]  auto feed system. I like it so far. I'm in a four by four tent under a 1000 watt light.
[05:46.130 --> 05:50.070]  You are cranking that light. That is pretty intense in there. Usually I'd start my plants
[05:50.070 --> 05:55.730]  under a small T five until they can take the one K metal halide dim down to 500 Watts.
[05:55.730 --> 05:59.410]  Then when they are a couple of weeks away from flower, I up the power to seven 50 to
[05:59.410 --> 06:03.930]  give them a boost of growth and to get them used to the increased intensity. So far that
[06:03.930 --> 06:08.990]  sounds right. This time when they are under the seven 51 plant seems like she just doesn't
[06:08.990 --> 06:14.770]  like the increased intensity at all. She droops really badly after about 10 to 12 hours. Should
[06:14.770 --> 06:18.610]  I not flower her and just get rid of her? I'd like to flower very soon and this has
[06:18.610 --> 06:23.850]  been going on for a week or longer. I feel like she might just be a weak seed and she's
[06:23.850 --> 06:28.710]  also considerably smaller than all of the other girls of the same age. Sorry for the
[06:28.710 --> 06:34.110]  long winded email. I do hope to hear back from you from a fellow grower signed Mitch.
[06:34.110 --> 06:37.990]  All right, let's talk about this one a little bit. There's something that stood out to me.
[06:37.990 --> 06:42.230]  These are from seed. You've got one run that is not performing up to speed. I'm going to
[06:42.230 --> 06:46.590]  guess that is probably you may be right. That is probably just a run. It is probably just
[06:46.590 --> 06:51.770]  not the most vigorous seedling ever. That does happen. So you've got your run plant.
[06:51.770 --> 06:55.350]  That is the main start of this problem. I think then when you ramped up your lighting
[06:55.350 --> 06:58.790]  like you normally do, which is correct, you shouldn't start those small plants under that
[06:58.790 --> 07:01.790]  super intense light because that will kind of roast them. That'll overcharge them. You
[07:01.790 --> 07:05.850]  don't need that. It's also excessive and expensive. So you start them with a low light. You work
[07:05.850 --> 07:09.550]  your way up. Now when you worked your way up, you noticed that this plant did not seem
[07:09.550 --> 07:13.470]  to like the increased intensity. So there are a couple of things making that happen.
[07:13.470 --> 07:17.290]  She's small. She didn't grow to the size of the other plants. I don't have a size comparison
[07:17.290 --> 07:20.670]  because I don't have any pictures in front of me here, but I'm going to assume that that
[07:20.670 --> 07:26.350]  plant is small enough to where the light that it is receiving is far more than it needs
[07:26.350 --> 07:30.510]  because it is smaller than the rest of those plants who are large enough to receive and
[07:30.510 --> 07:36.150]  photosynthesize that much light. So that light is probably getting too much light. It is
[07:36.150 --> 07:40.470]  reaching its daily light integral. It's getting as much light as it needs and it's saying,
[07:40.470 --> 07:44.990]  I'm done. And it's just kind of shutting itself down and it's taking a little break. And that's
[07:44.990 --> 07:49.110]  basically because you've got a tiny plant that's getting a lot of light and it's getting
[07:49.110 --> 07:53.510]  all the light that it needs. So it's just like, Hey, I'm done. I've gotten what I need.
[07:53.510 --> 07:56.470]  Basically if it were an animal, it would walk away from the food bowl and it would go lay
[07:56.470 --> 07:59.710]  down somewhere. And that's what your plant is doing. It's had enough light. It's going
[07:59.710 --> 08:04.030]  to go take a little break. If it had one, it would walk up to a hammock, smoke a joint
[08:04.030 --> 08:09.030]  and chill out for a little while. Ooh, that's weird. Would it smoke a joint? That's a whole
[08:09.030 --> 08:13.170]  another podcast. Is that cannibalism? If a cannabis plant rolls up a joint and smokes
[08:13.170 --> 08:17.070]  it to relax, that's cannibalism, right? That's weird. Anyway, let's get back on track here.
[08:17.070 --> 08:21.350]  I told you guys that lemon G dab really got to me. So my first suspicion is that that
[08:21.350 --> 08:25.390]  seedling that grew smaller was just a run. Maybe something happened to it in its very
[08:25.390 --> 08:29.190]  early stages of life that stunted its growth, but you've got to run. Somehow it was either
[08:29.190 --> 08:34.390]  a run by genetics or it was damaged early on. It is a run. Then you put it in the room
[08:34.390 --> 08:37.750]  with the other plants and tried to increase the light intensity and it was not prepared
[08:37.750 --> 08:42.270]  for that. So it is reacting to that. It will probably continue to grow slowly. It will
[08:42.270 --> 08:46.710]  never catch up with those other plants. Your next question is, should I not flower this
[08:46.750 --> 08:51.150]  one and just get rid of it? I don't know what your garden looks like. I don't know what
[08:51.150 --> 08:54.390]  your space looks like. I don't know what the rest of the plants look like. I don't know
[08:54.390 --> 08:59.350]  what your canopy looks like. If you can call that plant and still have a full canopy and
[08:59.350 --> 09:05.870]  produce your expected harvest, your expected yield, if you can meet your medicine demands
[09:05.870 --> 09:09.550]  by calling that one plant and still having the appropriate size harvest, if you can meet
[09:09.550 --> 09:13.270]  your whatever production needs that you have set for yourself, your production goals, if
[09:13.270 --> 09:17.230]  you can reach those by calling that plant, by all means, get rid of it. If that one plant
[09:17.230 --> 09:21.550]  is going to make or break you, keep it. Maybe keep it off to the side forever. Since it's
[09:21.550 --> 09:25.310]  already a run, it'll just be off to the side. It'll be that plant in the corner. Feed it
[09:25.310 --> 09:29.350]  the last of the nutrients, water everything else and give that one the crap at the end.
[09:29.350 --> 09:33.430]  It may not be the best plant, but it is another plant. It's a little bit more product. A lot
[09:33.430 --> 09:36.630]  of people are making concentrates anyway. So if it's not the prettiest, the tightest
[09:36.630 --> 09:40.110]  buds, you can still squish it. You can still extract it. You can still do whatever you're
[09:40.110 --> 09:45.350]  going to do with it. If that plant is the one that is going to put you over your numbers,
[09:45.350 --> 09:50.230]  get rid of it. If you're in any illegal state and that plant is not up to the performance
[09:50.230 --> 09:53.830]  level of the rest of your plants, get rid of it. But if you've got time and space for
[09:53.830 --> 09:58.390]  that plant, keep it around, let it try. If you are in a tight space, in a tight position,
[09:58.390 --> 10:02.230]  she needs to go. That is where you need to make a judgment call, my friend. If your canopy
[10:02.230 --> 10:06.070]  is full and the rest of the plants look great, get rid of it. If that one's not going to
[10:06.070 --> 10:09.950]  reach the top, if you've got to lift it up on two or three pots to make it taller and
[10:09.950 --> 10:13.630]  it's going to be a pain in the ass and cause you problems and frustrate you, get rid of
[10:13.630 --> 10:17.990]  it. Try to look forward to about week four or five and see if that plant is going to
[10:17.990 --> 10:21.790]  be more frustration or if it's going to be more pleasure. If it's going to just piss
[10:21.790 --> 10:25.510]  you off and that's the one plant in the room that's causing all the problems, get rid of
[10:25.510 --> 10:28.110]  it. We don't need that kind of stuff around in the grow.
[10:28.110 --> 10:31.870]  I don't know your situation, so it's kind of hard to say. I would probably just toss
[10:31.870 --> 10:35.270]  it. I don't need something that grows poorly like that. I would just get rid of it. When
[10:35.270 --> 10:38.390]  you're growing from seed and you've got a little one like that, you're generally doing
[10:38.390 --> 10:42.510]  a pheno hunt, so you should expect some males and you should expect some runts and some
[10:42.510 --> 10:47.310]  bullshit. This is your runty bullshit. Get rid of it. You already planned for this, hopefully.
[10:47.310 --> 10:50.870]  That's what I would do. I don't know your situation. I am fucking rambly from that lemon
[10:50.870 --> 10:55.030]  G dab. I want to thank you for that great email. You gave me a lot of opportunity for
[10:55.030 --> 10:59.550]  a lot of good information. Fellow grower, Mitch, thank you for that. I do appreciate
[10:59.550 --> 11:04.950]  it. Let's move on to the next email in this episode.
[11:04.950 --> 11:09.190]  This email goes just like this. Hey, Jeff, firstly, I want to thank you for all of the
[11:09.190 --> 11:14.110]  content you have provided me. I have gone from a hypothetical noob at growing to actually
[11:14.110 --> 11:20.190]  knowing enough to keep me going for a long time. Hey, that is my exact goal. I'm trying
[11:20.190 --> 11:23.530]  to ... What do they say? You give a man a joint, he'll be stoned for an hour. You teach
[11:23.530 --> 11:27.870]  a man to grow, he'll get the whole crew stoned for the rest of your lives. That's what I'm
[11:27.870 --> 11:30.870]  trying to do. I'm trying to keep the whole crew stoned, and now that's your job, dude.
[11:30.870 --> 11:33.830]  Now that you're learning how to do it, you have dedicated yourself. It's time to step
[11:33.910 --> 11:38.030]  up. Anyway, I'm glad that I've got you going for a long time. The message continues to
[11:38.030 --> 11:42.670]  say, I started listening to your podcast around the time the Grow compilations were released.
[11:42.670 --> 11:48.510]  I am now starting from episode one, and I have managed to get 200 episodes in. Man,
[11:48.510 --> 11:52.550]  I love when people go back and listen to the old episodes. Honestly, it's a little bit
[11:52.550 --> 11:56.510]  embarrassing, because I was not very good at podcasting. Now I am quite comfortable
[11:56.510 --> 12:00.750]  on a mic. It feels so weird to hear the old stuff. I'm sure everybody who does recording
[12:00.750 --> 12:06.510]  and broadcasting says that. I digress. The message says, so I'm not doing too bad. You
[12:06.510 --> 12:11.870]  are a smart dude, and you are very easy to listen to, even with the American to UK accent
[12:11.870 --> 12:15.470]  barrier. Hey, thanks for listening to me, man. I'm glad that the accent doesn't drive
[12:15.470 --> 12:19.990]  you crazy. I hope it's easy to listen to. Some folks with accents are hard to understand.
[12:19.990 --> 12:25.230]  I hope I'm doing a great job for you. The message continues with, keep up the amazing
[12:25.230 --> 12:29.230]  work, and I will keep recommending you to my English buddies. Hey, thanks for that.
[12:29.230 --> 12:33.030]  I appreciate all of the recommendations. That really does help to spread a podcast
[12:33.030 --> 12:38.230]  and help us grow. Also, helps us spread the positive message of cannabis. So I appreciate
[12:38.230 --> 12:42.470]  that. Thank you. Now he keeps going. He says, I have one request, and I hope this is something
[12:42.470 --> 12:48.110]  you could maybe dedicate an episode to. Would you be able to do an episode on making crumble
[12:48.110 --> 12:52.990]  wax? I'm investing in the kit very soon, and I want to have your knowledge as well as the
[12:52.990 --> 12:58.990]  100 YouTube videos I have watched. You are the best dude, and say hi to Mike for me.
[12:58.990 --> 13:05.630]  Cheers, Just Baz. P.S. I will be doing this BHO in a very safe environment, so you do
[13:05.630 --> 13:12.110]  not have to worry about that. So first off, let's make sure that we say shout out to white
[13:12.110 --> 13:16.630]  Mike. Hey, Mike, our new friend, Just Baz, says hello. I want to make sure I cover that
[13:16.630 --> 13:19.710]  for you because he said specifically here in the message, say what's up to Mike. So
[13:19.710 --> 13:23.430]  there you are, Mike. And by the way, Mike, come record, come hang out. I miss you, bro.
[13:23.430 --> 13:28.750]  Hope you're doing well. Now, I do really appreciate that this person started off with a paragraph
[13:29.510 --> 13:36.830]  of compliments, and then they made a request that I cannot fulfill. I am not a BHO hash
[13:36.830 --> 13:43.150]  maker. I am not a crumble wax maker. That is not my expertise. That is not my wheelhouse
[13:43.150 --> 13:50.030]  by any means. I cannot safely and effectively teach you how to make BHO concentrates without
[13:50.030 --> 13:56.190]  feeling like I am going to set you up to hurt yourself. That would be irresponsible of me
[13:56.270 --> 14:00.030]  to try to teach you that. I don't know what I'm doing. First off, you wouldn't come out
[14:00.030 --> 14:03.950]  with a quality product if I taught you because I don't know what I'm doing. And second, you
[14:03.950 --> 14:07.790]  would hurt yourself. You would potentially hurt yourself and or others, and I don't want
[14:07.790 --> 14:12.110]  to be responsible for that. So I just have to respectfully and politely say, dude, that
[14:12.110 --> 14:16.350]  is not for me to teach. I don't know what I'm doing there. I have no problems admitting
[14:16.350 --> 14:20.990]  that I don't know how to make BHO. I know how to do it the basic ways, but I do not
[14:20.990 --> 14:25.070]  know how to teach you how to do it safely and effectively without feeling like I'm setting
[14:25.070 --> 14:30.030]  you up to hurt yourself. And you're my friend, and I would feel like shit if I ever hurt one
[14:30.030 --> 14:34.670]  of my friends or if one of my friends caused a problem in their life with my shitty advice.
[14:34.670 --> 14:40.110]  So I apologize that I cannot help you out with your request on making BHO crumble wax.
[14:40.110 --> 14:46.430]  I can give you some advice. My first advice is be more careful than you think you need to be.
[14:46.430 --> 14:50.190]  Everybody thinks that they're good at shit. Everybody, like you said, you do not have to
[14:51.070 --> 14:57.790]  worry. Don't get overconfident with volatile gases. You can really hurt yourself. Overconfidence
[14:57.790 --> 15:02.590]  is a big cause of problems. I don't know who you are. I don't know your science level. I don't
[15:02.590 --> 15:06.990]  know your level of thinking. I'm just saying don't get overconfident and cause problems.
[15:07.870 --> 15:12.270]  Don't have a cell phone around. Light switches and light bulbs can cause problems when there's
[15:12.270 --> 15:19.470]  enough butane in the air. For a legal BHO extraction facility in Colorado, we must be
[15:19.470 --> 15:24.670]  inspected by the fire department. There are several building inspections and fire department
[15:24.670 --> 15:30.350]  inspections required just to be allowed to run a hydrocarbon extraction in a legal facility.
[15:30.350 --> 15:35.310]  There are reasons for that. You can see on the news about once, it used to be more frequent.
[15:35.310 --> 15:39.470]  It used to be about every two weeks. It has slowed down. Now it's about every two months.
[15:39.470 --> 15:44.190]  You can read an article or you catch an article online of some person blowing their house up
[15:44.190 --> 15:48.670]  because they were making BHO in their bedroom, in their basement, somewhere they should not have
[15:48.670 --> 15:56.910]  been. So if you do decide to make BHO concentrates on your own, please be extra careful. Be scientific
[15:56.910 --> 16:02.990]  careful. Extra think every step. The smallest mistakes cause the largest problems when you
[16:02.990 --> 16:11.070]  are using hydrocarbons for extractions. It is also probably illegal to make extractions where you are.
[16:11.070 --> 16:16.830]  So I've got several reasons why I have to politely decline on giving you lessons on making crumble
[16:16.830 --> 16:25.150]  wax or BHO. Also, there are much better techniques and products to focus on making than crumble wax.
[16:25.150 --> 16:29.710]  Learn to make diamonds and sauce if you're going to do it. If you're going to put yourself in the
[16:29.710 --> 16:35.390]  situation, do it correctly and make the diamonds and the sauce. Don't waste time with the crumble
[16:35.390 --> 16:42.110]  wax. That is so 2005. Now, I am pretty sure that you are going to go against my friendly advice
[16:42.110 --> 16:46.670]  and you are going to make your own BHO concentrates because you are an adult and that is what you want
[16:46.670 --> 16:51.550]  to do and there is no reason why I should stop you. Do your thing. I'm just saying I can't help
[16:51.550 --> 16:56.910]  you too much, but do your thing. Have a great time. I hope it goes very well for you. Now, let me try
[16:56.910 --> 17:02.190]  to give you a couple of resources that may help you out since I don't have any resources from my
[17:02.190 --> 17:08.430]  experience. Our friends at the Dude Grow Show have done a great show on making BHO extraction.
[17:08.430 --> 17:14.910]  So you can check out the Dude Grow Show. Probably just search for the Dude Grow Show BHO extraction
[17:14.910 --> 17:21.230]  and you will get a great lesson from those guys. Then I would join a few cannabis-related forums
[17:21.230 --> 17:25.790]  and I would join a bunch of groups and learn as much as you can from those groups about
[17:25.790 --> 17:31.790]  hydrocarbon extraction. Find people in those groups that have experience and ask them specific
[17:31.790 --> 17:36.110]  questions and learn from people who have actually done it. It sounds like you're watching a lot of
[17:36.110 --> 17:40.510]  YouTube videos and you were following a lot of resources. I hope they are able to help you out
[17:40.510 --> 17:46.430]  more than I am because again, this is not my wheelhouse. Hey, JustBaz, I apologize for letting
[17:46.430 --> 17:50.830]  you down on this one. Sometimes I don't have an answer for everything, but I do hope you keep
[17:50.830 --> 17:56.110]  listening to the show and I do hope you keep recommending the show to your English buddies.
[17:56.110 --> 17:59.950]  I want to give you one more thanks for sending this great email and I look forward to hearing
[17:59.950 --> 18:04.430]  from you again in the future. If anybody else out there has questions, I would love to answer
[18:04.430 --> 18:08.590]  your questions as well. Again, there are some things I can't help you with, but I will do my
[18:08.590 --> 18:14.430]  best on most grow questions. My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com and I would love
[18:14.430 --> 18:20.270]  to hear from you. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to wrap up this quick midweek bonus episode of the
