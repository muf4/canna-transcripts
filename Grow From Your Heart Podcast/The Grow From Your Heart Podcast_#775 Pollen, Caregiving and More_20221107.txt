[00:01.080 --> 00:29.400]  All right, here we go.
[00:29.400 --> 00:31.040]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:31.040 --> 00:32.040]  I'm your host.
[00:32.040 --> 00:33.680]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:33.680 --> 00:37.920]  This is episode 775 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:37.920 --> 00:40.360]  I have a fun show lined up for you.
[00:40.360 --> 00:44.380]  Before we jump in, let's do a few shout-outs to a few of the great folks who continue to
[00:44.380 --> 00:47.140]  support the show on Patreon.
[00:47.140 --> 00:50.920]  Let's kick it off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout-out to my buddy
[00:50.920 --> 00:51.920]  Kip.
[00:51.920 --> 00:55.340]  I want to send a big thank you shout-out to Root305 and Randy Farms.
[00:55.340 --> 00:58.500]  Let's send a big thank you shout-out to Mr. Mean Green and Effa Plant Count.
[00:58.500 --> 01:03.620]  I want to send a special thank you shout-out to my friends Roll This Nug and ADHD Grower.
[01:03.620 --> 01:06.700]  Let's send a big fist bump to Noah N. in Growing Tennessee.
[01:06.700 --> 01:09.300]  Let's send a big thank you shout-out to William E. Downs.
[01:09.300 --> 01:11.520]  Let's send a thank you shout-out to Dreadlock Farmer.
[01:11.520 --> 01:15.460]  Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout-out
[01:15.460 --> 01:17.820]  to my friend Anvil Gardens.
[01:17.820 --> 01:22.900]  Big thanks and big shout-out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.

[01:40.800 --> 01:44.040]  of my friends to support the podcast.
[01:44.040 --> 01:48.120]  Speaking of support, I do want to send a big thank you to everybody who supported me
[01:48.120 --> 01:49.120]  on iRedirect.
[01:49.120 --> 01:54.220]  I did a Halloween sale for iRedirect and I had a tremendous response.
[01:54.220 --> 01:56.340]  It took me a little bit to get all of the orders out.
[01:56.340 --> 01:58.760]  I do apologize if you feel like it was delayed.
[01:58.760 --> 01:59.980]  It was just me doing it.
[01:59.980 --> 02:04.540]  Check for a tracking number because everything has been shipped up to this time.
[02:04.540 --> 02:09.580]  Once again, big thanks for the response to the Halloween sale on iRedirect.
[02:09.580 --> 02:11.060]  Now a little bit of an update.
[02:11.060 --> 02:15.720]  The Lemon Jeffrey and Golden Goat Femini seeds that everybody is asking for will be
[02:15.720 --> 02:19.920]  available and in stock on iRedirect for Black Friday.
[02:19.920 --> 02:20.920]  That's right.
[02:20.920 --> 02:24.960]  If you want more information or details or updates, I do encourage you to join the newsletter.
[02:24.960 --> 02:28.640]  You can go to iRegenetics.com, scroll down toward the bottom.

[02:31.640 --> 02:35.240]  We will get you on the newsletter, get you updates when new things do drop.

[02:45.700 --> 02:49.700]  Stay tuned because Golden Goat and Lemon Jeffrey will be dropping very soon.
[02:49.700 --> 02:52.140]  I know you're going to ask about Orangegasm next.
[02:52.140 --> 02:53.140]  Stay tuned.
[02:53.140 --> 02:56.060]  That one will be coming shortly after those.
[02:56.060 --> 03:01.020]  Also when it comes to ordering on iRedirect, or this may count, just about anywhere, if
[03:01.020 --> 03:06.700]  you're ordering things online, if you're purchasing things through the mail, let's put our real
[03:06.800 --> 03:12.440]  names on the package or at least a friendly name, a usable name on the package.
[03:12.440 --> 03:16.920]  I enjoy and I appreciate and I respect the work you're doing to create your own company.
[03:16.920 --> 03:21.520]  You've made a cool Instagram name that is whatever, something crazy hash company that
[03:21.520 --> 03:24.920]  is your new name or something seed company or something farms.
[03:24.920 --> 03:25.920]  That's really cool.
[03:25.920 --> 03:29.620]  I'm proud of you, but you don't have to put it on every shipping label when you're sending
[03:29.620 --> 03:30.760]  and receiving something.
[03:30.760 --> 03:34.800]  The less information on that label that is unnecessary is the better.
[03:34.900 --> 03:36.820]  Put your name and your address on there.
[03:36.820 --> 03:40.140]  What I'm talking about is I get orders that will say like, the order will be, and I'm
[03:40.140 --> 03:41.340]  just making shit up right here.
[03:41.340 --> 03:43.060]  Don't feel targeted unless you did this.
[03:43.060 --> 03:50.780]  It'll say like to Bill Smith from Ganja Farms Incorporated in Plano, Texas or Seattle, Washington.
[03:50.780 --> 03:55.140]  It doesn't matter where it is, but when you put Ganja Farms Incorporated or Big Fat Weed
[03:55.140 --> 03:59.260]  Farm or whatever on the fucking shipping label, that makes it a little suspicious.
[03:59.260 --> 04:01.540]  It gives me a couple of suspicions.
[04:01.540 --> 04:05.540]  First of all, the mail, the post office, the mail carrier, they're going to be like, who's
[04:05.540 --> 04:09.520]  fucking Ganja Supreme Ganja Farm 420 weed smoker?
[04:09.520 --> 04:10.520]  Who is this?
[04:10.520 --> 04:12.240]  They're going to want to know what the fuck is in there.
[04:12.240 --> 04:16.440]  Or maybe somebody in your area knows that you're ordering seeds and they see that name
[04:16.440 --> 04:18.040]  or they've recognized that name come through.
[04:18.040 --> 04:19.040]  They're going to pop it open.
[04:19.040 --> 04:23.000]  They're going to start stealing your shit because it's a very noticeable name.
[04:23.000 --> 04:26.400]  Blend in, be Bill Smith, be Jane Doe when it comes to the fucking mail.
[04:26.400 --> 04:27.400]  Be more careful.
[04:27.400 --> 04:28.400]  Please.
[04:28.400 --> 04:30.520]  That's my advice, my recommendation, my suggestion.
[04:30.520 --> 04:34.860]  I see a lot of people type in random, weird names when they're ordering through iRedirect
[04:34.860 --> 04:36.900]  and I try my best to delete those.
[04:36.900 --> 04:41.260]  I don't pay a lot of attention to correcting addresses, but if I see that you've got like
[04:41.260 --> 04:45.980]  Weed Grow Farms or Weed Warrior 420 or some shit in your name, I do try to remove that
[04:45.980 --> 04:49.660]  because we don't need our packages opened up, inspected and taken.
[04:49.660 --> 04:53.620]  Sending seeds is not illegal, but don't encourage anybody to mess with you, steal from you or
[04:53.620 --> 04:55.020]  cause you problems.
[04:55.020 --> 04:56.460]  Use your brain, use your head.
[04:56.460 --> 04:58.020]  Then your company will go further.
[04:58.080 --> 05:01.680]  I'm proud of you for having the company name, but you don't have to put it on everything.
[05:01.680 --> 05:03.720]  I don't put iRead Genetics on anything.
[05:03.720 --> 05:06.560]  I don't put Grow From Your Heart podcast on anything.
[05:06.560 --> 05:07.560]  That's not what it says.
[05:07.560 --> 05:10.160]  The mail is discreet and careful and very adult.
[05:10.160 --> 05:12.360]  That is my first rant for this episode.
[05:12.360 --> 05:15.680]  Let's be more pro when we're putting our names on packages.
[05:15.680 --> 05:17.400]  Also package shit more carefully.
[05:17.400 --> 05:19.440]  I try to package things where they won't get smushed.
[05:19.440 --> 05:21.520]  I send them in a priority mailbox.
[05:21.520 --> 05:24.680]  Get a lot of seeds that come in a bubble mailer and they're totally squished.
[05:24.680 --> 05:25.680]  Be more careful.
[05:25.680 --> 05:26.680]  Be more professional.
[05:26.740 --> 05:31.460]  Also, on the other end of that, if you've sent me seeds as a gift recently, thank you.
[05:31.460 --> 05:33.660]  I got them and I do appreciate it.
[05:33.660 --> 05:34.660]  Where do we go from here?
[05:34.660 --> 05:37.220]  I want to give a shout out to all my friends in Thailand.
[05:37.220 --> 05:38.220]  That's right.
[05:38.220 --> 05:39.900]  I'm not sure if I've mentioned this on the podcast yet.
[05:39.900 --> 05:42.660]  Thailand is now part of the team legalization.
[05:42.660 --> 05:43.660]  That's right.
[05:43.660 --> 05:44.820]  Thailand has legal cannabis.
[05:44.820 --> 05:46.420]  I've got some great friends over there.
[05:46.420 --> 05:49.820]  I'm not sure if they want their names said or not, but I'm going to say them right now.
[05:49.820 --> 05:51.500]  You might not even know who they are.
[05:51.500 --> 05:52.780]  Big shout out to my buddy Steve.
[05:52.780 --> 05:54.220]  Big shout out to my buddy Brett.
[05:54.240 --> 05:57.400]  They are killing it in the Thailand legal cannabis game.
[05:57.400 --> 05:59.680]  They've got commercial cultivations.
[05:59.680 --> 06:01.160]  They've got dispensaries.
[06:01.160 --> 06:02.160]  They've got clients.
[06:02.160 --> 06:03.360]  They've got a flow going.
[06:03.360 --> 06:07.960]  They've got standard operating procedures for selling legal cannabis in Thailand.
[06:07.960 --> 06:08.960]  I'm proud of you guys.
[06:08.960 --> 06:10.920]  It's good to see you doing it out there.
[06:10.920 --> 06:13.640]  If you're in Thailand, look for some IRE genetics.
[06:13.640 --> 06:17.600]  The strains and the seeds are on shelves out there in Thailand.
[06:17.600 --> 06:22.640]  Big up to everyone in Thailand who fought for and succeeded with the legalization of
[06:22.640 --> 06:23.800]  cannabis.
[06:23.800 --> 06:27.780]  The last piece of little rambling before we get to the email portion of the podcast,
[06:27.780 --> 06:31.140]  there are fresh t-shirts on the IRE genetics website.
[06:31.140 --> 06:34.900]  If you go to IREgenetics.com, click on the merge tab that will take you to the store
[06:34.900 --> 06:36.840]  where I do sell my merchandise.
[06:36.840 --> 06:38.260]  You will find new t-shirts.
[06:38.260 --> 06:39.520]  You will find long sleeve shirts.
[06:39.520 --> 06:42.420]  You will find hoodies and you will find women's tank tops.
[06:42.420 --> 06:43.420]  That's right.
[06:43.420 --> 06:45.380]  They've all got the cross logo on the front of them.
[06:45.380 --> 06:46.940]  Hit the website, grab your shirts.
[06:46.940 --> 06:48.540]  All the cool kids are doing it.
[06:48.540 --> 06:49.540]  One more thing.
[06:49.540 --> 06:51.020]  I said that was the last, but I do have one more.
[06:51.020 --> 06:52.660]  This is just shameless advertising.
[06:52.720 --> 06:57.200]  Ladies, I was talking with your boyfriend and I heard him say that he wanted some new
[06:57.200 --> 06:59.360]  IRE genetic seeds for Christmas.
[06:59.360 --> 07:00.360]  That's right.
[07:00.360 --> 07:01.360]  I'm sure he said that.
[07:01.360 --> 07:03.680]  The place to get them is IREdirect.com.
[07:03.680 --> 07:06.760]  Just in case you're not sure where to get your man his Christmas seeds, that is the
[07:06.760 --> 07:07.760]  place.
[07:07.760 --> 07:13.240]  Every man that smokes, grows, enjoys ganja, wants some new seeds for Christmas, IREdirect.com
[07:13.240 --> 07:14.960]  is the place to go.
[07:14.960 --> 07:17.320]  Now, let's do the fun part of this podcast.
[07:17.320 --> 07:19.960]  Let's jump into the email portion of this show.
[07:19.980 --> 07:24.020]  I do enjoy reading and answering listener questions.
[07:24.020 --> 07:26.460]  This is what I call listener generated content.
[07:26.460 --> 07:31.480]  I like this because I know that if I'm helping my friend Shep, who sent me this message,
[07:31.480 --> 07:32.660]  one person has this question.
[07:32.660 --> 07:36.240]  I know if one listener has this question, there are probably several people out there
[07:36.240 --> 07:38.540]  that this could help and be benefit to.
[07:38.540 --> 07:39.540]  I love the questions.
[07:39.540 --> 07:40.540]  Please send those to me.
[07:40.540 --> 07:45.660]  You can use the Grow Help tab on the website at IREgenetics.com or simply use my email,
[07:45.660 --> 07:47.660]  growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[07:48.560 --> 07:52.320]  This message came from my buddy Shep and it goes just like this.
[07:52.320 --> 07:53.720]  If I can pick it up, it goes.
[07:53.720 --> 07:55.200]  Hey, Ross to Jeff.
[07:55.200 --> 07:58.160]  Maybe you've discussed this before and if so, my apologies.
[07:58.160 --> 07:59.160]  You know what?
[07:59.160 --> 08:02.760]  I will repeat subjects on here because I've realized that not everybody listens to every
[08:02.760 --> 08:03.940]  single episode.
[08:03.940 --> 08:05.940]  People don't go back and listen to everything.
[08:05.940 --> 08:07.440]  If you do, thank you.
[08:07.440 --> 08:09.920]  That's a dedicated certain kind of podcast listener.
[08:09.920 --> 08:13.440]  I appreciate you, but most people jump in and they just catch the future episodes.
[08:13.440 --> 08:15.320]  They don't go backwards.
[08:15.340 --> 08:18.580]  I have talked about this possibly, but we'll do it again.
[08:18.580 --> 08:23.300]  It says, I grow in a three by three scrog and I recently had a cannabis variety that
[08:23.300 --> 08:28.740]  is female, including a female test from a very reputable and well-known breeder in the
[08:28.740 --> 08:29.740]  community.
[08:29.740 --> 08:31.900]  Then it says in parentheses, it was not used.
[08:31.900 --> 08:34.440]  So this is not one of my lines we're talking about here.
[08:34.440 --> 08:37.820]  It says, this is a nine to 11 week variety.
[08:37.820 --> 08:43.900]  At week five, day 38 in bloom, I found two male flower clusters.
[08:44.400 --> 08:48.280]  So you're growing what you thought and assumed and probably was tested to be a female.
[08:48.280 --> 08:50.280]  It sounds like it was a feminized seed.
[08:50.280 --> 08:53.200]  You thought it was a girl and at day 38, guess what?
[08:53.200 --> 08:55.520]  We see some male flowers.
[08:55.520 --> 09:00.140]  This female plant is now showing intersex traits, which is a problem, especially around
[09:00.140 --> 09:03.620]  week five of a nine to 11 week plant.
[09:03.620 --> 09:04.620]  It does go on.
[09:04.620 --> 09:10.980]  It says, I found two male clusters below the scrog screen, very much in the shade.
[09:10.980 --> 09:13.400]  So those are the buds down below the scrog.
[09:13.400 --> 09:15.520]  So there's a screen, the light's hitting down here.
[09:15.520 --> 09:16.740]  Some of the light doesn't get down here.
[09:16.740 --> 09:22.000]  That part down there is where we are discovering the intersex parts of this plant.
[09:22.000 --> 09:26.200]  It says, unfortunately, I missed these little bastards and two male flowers have opened
[09:26.200 --> 09:28.480]  before I found and removed them.
[09:28.480 --> 09:29.480]  All right.
[09:29.480 --> 09:30.800]  So you've got opened up flowers.
[09:30.800 --> 09:31.800]  They're popped open.
[09:31.800 --> 09:34.440]  You can see they've been expressed as the word we used.
[09:34.440 --> 09:35.440]  That's never a good sign.
[09:35.440 --> 09:38.520]  That means that they probably let out some pollen into the air.
[09:38.520 --> 09:40.020]  That pollen is super light.
[09:40.060 --> 09:43.320]  It does not take a lot of air for that pollen to move around.
[09:43.320 --> 09:48.560]  It says, question, since these male flowers were below the scrog, below the canopy, just
[09:48.560 --> 09:50.920]  how bad could this be?
[09:50.920 --> 09:53.600]  How badly seeded do you think my buds will be?
[09:53.600 --> 09:57.400]  It says, what are the odds that the pollen will be fertile?
[09:57.400 --> 10:01.080]  There's been no male flower anywhere else on this plant other than these and the shade,
[10:01.080 --> 10:02.080]  by the way.
[10:02.080 --> 10:03.080]  Thanks and best wishes.
[10:03.080 --> 10:04.080]  All right.
[10:04.080 --> 10:05.080]  Let's talk about that for a little bit.
[10:05.080 --> 10:10.000]  The first question, since these flowers were below the scrog, just how bad could it be?
[10:10.980 --> 10:13.980]  I said a moment ago that pollen travels very easily.
[10:13.980 --> 10:14.980]  Pollen is really light.
[10:14.980 --> 10:16.260]  Unfortunately, sometimes it goes up.
[10:16.260 --> 10:18.020]  I've seen pollen move up.
[10:18.020 --> 10:19.020]  It doesn't always fall.
[10:19.020 --> 10:23.020]  If there's a little bit of airflow, the wind directed off something or ricochet, something
[10:23.020 --> 10:25.820]  like that, I've seen pollen actually move up into the air.
[10:25.820 --> 10:28.660]  So it could have gone up into your full canopy.
[10:28.660 --> 10:30.700]  I don't want to make you paranoid.
[10:30.700 --> 10:32.260]  I don't want to give you any false hope.
[10:32.260 --> 10:33.460]  It could have gone up there.
[10:33.460 --> 10:34.780]  Also, it might not have.
[10:34.780 --> 10:39.580]  I don't know how much pollen those few male flowers opened up, but they did let some pollen
[10:39.580 --> 10:42.040]  out possibly, and it probably went up.
[10:42.040 --> 10:43.040]  Some of it went down.
[10:43.040 --> 10:44.040]  It went everywhere.
[10:44.040 --> 10:45.040]  That's the way that pollen works.
[10:45.040 --> 10:47.000]  When they pop open, they kind of have a little pressure to them.
[10:47.000 --> 10:50.200]  It's like they just breathe out just a little bit to let it go.
[10:50.200 --> 10:52.040]  So it could be bad.
[10:52.040 --> 10:53.320]  It could be not bad at all.
[10:53.320 --> 10:56.520]  I really, we can't tell until a couple of probably a few days.
[10:56.520 --> 10:57.520]  You'll be able to tell.
[10:57.520 --> 11:00.120]  You'll see little kernels happening, and that's where the seeds are starting to form.
[11:00.120 --> 11:03.960]  It looks like something just went weird, like your your calyxes are swollen up.
[11:03.960 --> 11:07.360]  What are the odds this pollen could be sterile or fertile?
[11:07.360 --> 11:08.360]  That's yes.
[11:08.460 --> 11:09.460]  Both.
[11:09.460 --> 11:11.300]  It could be either way, dude.
[11:11.300 --> 11:13.140]  It could definitely be either way.
[11:13.140 --> 11:15.300]  And it says there have been no male flowers anywhere else.
[11:15.300 --> 11:16.300]  That's a good thing.
[11:16.300 --> 11:17.300]  Cut those off.
[11:17.300 --> 11:18.300]  Keep an eye on it.
[11:18.300 --> 11:19.300]  Pay very close attention.
[11:19.300 --> 11:20.300]  There may be more.
[11:20.300 --> 11:22.020]  You've got six more weeks to go possibly.
[11:22.020 --> 11:25.020]  I'd probably take this shit down early and then not grow it ever again is what I would
[11:25.020 --> 11:27.060]  do, but pay attention.
[11:27.060 --> 11:28.780]  You may have produced a few seeds.
[11:28.780 --> 11:31.900]  You may have produced a lot of seeds, and that's where I go on that one rant where I
[11:31.900 --> 11:33.960]  say grow those seeds, bro.
[11:33.960 --> 11:36.940]  You may have just made a bunch of great seeds for yourself to play with.
[11:36.940 --> 11:37.940]  Grow them.
[11:38.520 --> 11:42.160]  You may, like I've said in a past episode, you may have just created gold.
[11:42.160 --> 11:45.960]  You may have the new chem dog, the new golden goat, the new gorilla glue.
[11:45.960 --> 11:48.280]  You may have the new chefs OG in there.
[11:48.280 --> 11:49.640]  Who knows what you just made?
[11:49.640 --> 11:54.120]  Also, you could have made a bunch of intersex plants that stress out and hermaphrodite and
[11:54.120 --> 11:58.640]  show problems as soon as they get a light leak, too much temperature problem or too
[11:58.640 --> 11:59.720]  much shade or whatever.
[11:59.720 --> 12:01.960]  So grow those seeds if they do happen.
[12:01.960 --> 12:06.280]  But I honestly, without looking at the plants, the room, getting in there with the light
[12:06.380 --> 12:10.340]  and kind of looking around, I can't tell you enough details to give you any diagnosis
[12:10.340 --> 12:11.420]  or prognosis.
[12:11.420 --> 12:12.420]  You could have seeds.
[12:12.420 --> 12:13.420]  You may not.
[12:13.420 --> 12:18.980]  They could have been fully fertile or fully sterile flowers that opened up.
[12:18.980 --> 12:20.940]  That pollen could have been good or bad.
[12:20.940 --> 12:22.820]  Did you see any dust?
[12:22.820 --> 12:27.620]  If you see any dust laying around those male flowers, like the leaves around it may just
[12:27.620 --> 12:30.340]  have like, it just looks like you sprinkled them with powdered sugar.
[12:30.340 --> 12:31.340]  That's pollen.
[12:31.340 --> 12:32.340]  That's going to be a bad sign.
[12:32.340 --> 12:35.980]  If there's no dust, then chances are a little bit better for you.
[12:35.980 --> 12:38.240]  That's really all I think I've got for you for this one.
[12:38.240 --> 12:39.320]  Keep an eye on it.
[12:39.320 --> 12:41.960]  And then if you do see seeds forming, you've got decisions to make.
[12:41.960 --> 12:44.440]  Do you want to finish it or do you want to chop it down?
[12:44.440 --> 12:49.360]  And then definitely consider if you ever want to run that particular cultivar again, because
[12:49.360 --> 12:52.160]  it did freak out just from a little bit of shade.
[12:52.160 --> 12:53.480]  That's not something that I would tolerate.
[12:53.480 --> 12:54.880]  All right, let's keep moving.
[12:54.880 --> 12:56.860]  Chef, thank you for the great message.
[12:56.860 --> 12:57.860]  Let's keep moving.
[12:57.860 --> 13:00.440]  There is another message that came from our friend Matt.
[13:00.440 --> 13:02.520]  It says, hey, Ross to Jeff, I hope you're doing well.
[13:02.520 --> 13:04.560]  I love the recent Grateful Dog episode.
[13:04.660 --> 13:06.020]  Hey, thank you for listening.
[13:06.020 --> 13:08.700]  I got a lot of great response to that episode.
[13:08.700 --> 13:12.540]  The number one question that stemmed from that is can I get seeds or buy a clone?
[13:12.540 --> 13:17.100]  And the number one answer for that is no, not right now, maybe in the future.
[13:17.100 --> 13:19.900]  But no, I'm not selling clones or seeds of that one right now.
[13:19.900 --> 13:24.580]  I'm crossing things with it, but there will be a Jack the Ripper Grateful Dog cross available
[13:24.580 --> 13:25.580]  very soon.
[13:25.580 --> 13:28.100]  It's called Dog Ripper, but we're not selling the Grateful Dog right now.
[13:28.100 --> 13:31.580]  It says also, I have got a question for you.
[13:31.580 --> 13:36.720]  When would you consider a home grower ready to advance to the role of caregiver?
[13:36.720 --> 13:40.740]  And do you have any advice regarding scaling up a grow over time?
[13:40.740 --> 13:41.740]  So this is a great question.
[13:41.740 --> 13:45.080]  Let me talk about what the word caregiver means.
[13:45.080 --> 13:49.940]  Most of what I'm going to say applies to the Colorado medical cannabis market.
[13:49.940 --> 13:54.280]  And most of this is info from around 2008, 2009.
[13:54.280 --> 13:58.160]  Since that time, we have changed the term from caregiver to provider.
[13:58.160 --> 13:59.720]  But let me explain this.
[13:59.740 --> 14:04.540]  When we started medical cannabis, a lot of people wanted access to medical cannabis without
[14:04.540 --> 14:06.320]  going to a dispensary.
[14:06.320 --> 14:11.540]  When you got your medical cannabis recommendation from a doctor, it gave you the right to grow
[14:11.540 --> 14:14.940]  six or more plants, depending on the paperwork you got.
[14:14.940 --> 14:17.760]  So people were allowed to grow six plants.
[14:17.760 --> 14:20.420]  Now the catch was some of these people were very sick.
[14:20.420 --> 14:24.860]  They were receiving medical cannabis for a reason, which also limited their ability to
[14:24.860 --> 14:26.380]  produce their own cannabis.
[14:26.380 --> 14:27.560]  Maybe they were sick.
[14:27.560 --> 14:29.140]  Maybe they were physically unable.
[14:29.160 --> 14:32.540]  Maybe they just didn't have the room, the space, and of course the knowledge to produce
[14:32.540 --> 14:34.000]  their own cannabis.
[14:34.000 --> 14:38.640]  So what those people would do is they would assign somebody that would be called a caregiver
[14:38.640 --> 14:41.960]  to produce their medical cannabis products for them.
[14:41.960 --> 14:45.180]  So when I go to the weed doctor, the weed doctor gives me a paper and it says, you can
[14:45.180 --> 14:47.340]  smoke and grow and have weed.
[14:47.340 --> 14:51.380]  Then on that card, there's a spot that says, who is your caregiver?
[14:51.380 --> 14:53.680]  I would find a friend or we would find somebody.
[14:53.680 --> 14:56.040]  A lot of people would find me and they would list.
[14:56.040 --> 14:57.920]  So we'll just put me as the caregiver.
[14:57.920 --> 14:59.840]  Mike, I've got your permission to do this.
[14:59.840 --> 15:02.340]  I hope I'm going to use Mike as an example.
[15:02.340 --> 15:06.260]  When the medical cannabis thing came up, our good friend, white Mike, he's a medical cannabis
[15:06.260 --> 15:07.260]  patient.
[15:07.260 --> 15:08.660]  He likes the way I grow weed.
[15:08.660 --> 15:11.220]  So he asked me one day, want to be my caregiver?
[15:11.220 --> 15:13.320]  And I said, I would be honored to bro.
[15:13.320 --> 15:17.520]  So then at that point he wrote my name on his card and sent it into the state and that
[15:17.520 --> 15:21.640]  gives me the right to grow Mike's medical marijuana plants for him.
[15:21.640 --> 15:25.680]  So I could have those in my possession in my cultivation area and it would be fully
[15:25.680 --> 15:28.140]  legal because I was Mike's caregiver.
[15:28.140 --> 15:33.960]  Now when that weed was ready, it was my responsibility to provide Mike with that product.
[15:33.960 --> 15:39.300]  There were not many legal stipulations or bylines or guidelines or bylaws or anything
[15:39.300 --> 15:41.940]  about how I could give Mike his medicine.
[15:41.940 --> 15:45.900]  I wasn't supposed to make a profit from it is what I think that the, uh, the paperwork
[15:45.900 --> 15:50.660]  said, but I could definitely charge Mike for electricity, my time, my seeds, whatever I
[15:50.660 --> 15:55.280]  felt necessary, but I wasn't supposed to profit off of Mike for it, which I never did.
[15:55.380 --> 16:00.000]  Mike always got the hookups on the weed, but my responsibility and my role as a caregiver
[16:00.000 --> 16:05.840]  was to grow safe, effective cannabis for Mike and supply it on the rhythm that Mike expected
[16:05.840 --> 16:09.800]  his medicine and he needed his medicine and he would tell me what he liked the best and
[16:09.800 --> 16:13.800]  I would grow that and I would have it when he needed it at a price he could for afford.
[16:13.800 --> 16:17.520]  Most of the time I just gave it to him because that was just the bond that we had.
[16:17.520 --> 16:18.980]  He liked the way that I grew.
[16:18.980 --> 16:22.940]  He gave me the ability to grow more plants because I had his medical marijuana card.
[16:22.940 --> 16:26.560]  He kept me legal and safe, so I just grow enough and make sure to set some aside for
[16:26.560 --> 16:30.520]  Mike and anytime he needed it, there it was and it worked out that way.
[16:30.520 --> 16:34.060]  One of the best parts about that is being Mike's best friend.
[16:34.060 --> 16:35.060]  Uh, we're, we're bros.
[16:35.060 --> 16:36.220]  We're in the car all the time.
[16:36.220 --> 16:37.340]  We're next to each other in the office.
[16:37.340 --> 16:38.900]  We're at the dab table together.
[16:38.900 --> 16:41.860]  I know Mike's physical ailments.
[16:41.860 --> 16:44.080]  I know Mike's, uh, mental state.
[16:44.080 --> 16:45.200]  I know what Mike likes.
[16:45.200 --> 16:47.860]  I know what Mike, what flavors Mike enjoys.
[16:47.860 --> 16:52.340]  So I got to really dial in Mike and I together got to dial in what medicine Mike was receiving
[16:52.740 --> 16:54.180]  and what I was providing for Mike.
[16:54.180 --> 16:55.700]  I know that he loves grateful dog.
[16:55.700 --> 16:59.460]  If he could have grateful dog seven days a week, 24 hours a day, that's what Mike would
[16:59.460 --> 17:01.300]  smoke and I could see it on him.
[17:01.300 --> 17:03.220]  Like, I'd be like, oh, it's about time for Mike to get some weed.
[17:03.220 --> 17:07.180]  Cause I could see his body and his facial expression change time to smoke Mike out.
[17:07.180 --> 17:11.340]  So we got to develop like a real bonafide caregiver, a patient relationship, which I
[17:11.340 --> 17:12.540]  think was great.
[17:12.540 --> 17:14.760]  So that is the caregiver idea.
[17:14.760 --> 17:18.880]  We would be assigned as his caregiver and then I could grow cannabis for him.
[17:18.880 --> 17:21.840]  And when he needed that cannabis, it would be ready for him.
[17:21.840 --> 17:25.400]  And if he needed edibles, topicals, oils, whatever it would be.
[17:25.400 --> 17:30.040]  My responsibility is his caregiver and friend to make that product available and ready for
[17:30.040 --> 17:35.840]  him for his consumption needs to fix his ailments to improve the quality of his life was the
[17:35.840 --> 17:36.940]  bottom line.
[17:36.940 --> 17:38.600]  So that's what a caregiver is.
[17:38.600 --> 17:42.440]  The idea is to provide cannabis for a medical marijuana patient.
[17:42.440 --> 17:44.480]  Since then they have changed the term to provider.
[17:44.480 --> 17:49.040]  You just write provider in the card and they've also really limited us now in Colorado.
[17:49.040 --> 17:52.760]  Back in the day you were allowed to have a like unlimited counts to where you could
[17:52.760 --> 17:56.640]  just get everybody could be, you could be everybody's caregiver.
[17:56.640 --> 18:02.280]  So like everybody in the neighborhood, I would be Clint, Mike, my mom, uh, fucking the neighbor,
[18:02.280 --> 18:03.280]  the neighbor down the street.
[18:03.280 --> 18:06.200]  I was all of their caregiver and I was just growing so much herb and providing herb for
[18:06.200 --> 18:07.200]  everybody.
[18:07.200 --> 18:11.600]  So I got a lot of experience is how I understood what people like, what people want, how often
[18:11.600 --> 18:12.600]  they do it.
[18:12.600 --> 18:16.880]  I learned a lot by doing that sort of stuff that got me, um, that definitely worked well
[18:17.000 --> 18:20.320]  in the medical cannabis realm.
[18:20.320 --> 18:23.640]  So we would do what was called card stacking is I would have everybody's cards and I would
[18:23.640 --> 18:27.940]  just grow for all of them and we'd put all their plants in one cultivation area.
[18:27.940 --> 18:31.960]  Then the state came down and said, you can only have six patients, which limited me to,
[18:31.960 --> 18:33.960]  uh, that would be six times.
[18:33.960 --> 18:35.440]  Six is 36 plus my six.
[18:35.440 --> 18:37.220]  That was 42 plants.
[18:37.220 --> 18:40.600]  Then County started saying, Oh, you're only limited to 12 plants.
[18:40.600 --> 18:44.280]  You can have your six recreational and your six medical plants, but you're not allowed
[18:44.280 --> 18:48.200]  to grow more than that, which the States and counties are, the cities and counties
[18:48.200 --> 18:53.440]  are allowed to do that sort of stuff within their own boundaries and borders, their own,
[18:53.440 --> 18:54.640]  what's it called their own council.
[18:54.640 --> 18:56.480]  So, uh, that's what happened a lot here.
[18:56.480 --> 18:58.760]  So now we're just limited to 12 and I can grow 12 plants.
[18:58.760 --> 19:03.000]  I basically keep it down to, uh, 10 females and two boys is what we basically do.
[19:03.000 --> 19:04.680]  You got the 12 count.
[19:04.680 --> 19:07.340]  So, um, that was the role of the caregiver.
[19:07.340 --> 19:10.560]  That's what a caregiver does on is expected to do.
[19:10.560 --> 19:15.560]  Now our friend Matt here is asking, when is the, uh, when do you know it's time to
[19:15.560 --> 19:19.240]  consider a home grower ready to advance to the role of caregiver?
[19:19.240 --> 19:20.240]  That's a really good question.
[19:20.240 --> 19:24.300]  It's a really thin line that you're skating there between caregiver and home grower.
[19:24.300 --> 19:25.300]  So let's talk about that.
[19:25.300 --> 19:29.720]  The way that it worked for me is, uh, people enjoyed smoking the herb that I grew.
[19:29.720 --> 19:30.720]  People sought me out.
[19:30.720 --> 19:34.720]  They're like, you are, and this sounds egotistical, but at the time, I don't know about now, but
[19:34.720 --> 19:39.120]  at the time around here, I was one of the best and most noticed weed growers that there
[19:39.120 --> 19:40.120]  was.
[19:40.680 --> 19:41.680]  I was involved with dispensaries.
[19:41.680 --> 19:42.680]  I was growing weed everywhere.
[19:42.680 --> 19:44.400]  I came up real quick and people noticed it.
[19:44.400 --> 19:47.000]  So a lot of people wanted me to be their caregiver.
[19:47.000 --> 19:51.360]  Also I was involved in a dispensary, so that put me out there a lot and I got to be a lot
[19:51.360 --> 19:52.800]  of people's caregiver.
[19:52.800 --> 19:55.320]  So people knew that I was growing good weed.
[19:55.320 --> 20:00.000]  They knew that I knew how to interact with people and have conversations and build relationships
[20:00.000 --> 20:01.560]  and that I'm compassionate.
[20:01.560 --> 20:02.560]  And what's the other word?
[20:02.560 --> 20:06.440]  I've got empathy and, um, yeah, I just like to connect with people and I care about you.
[20:06.440 --> 20:09.600]  And I love the way that, uh, when you smoke, you feel better.
[20:09.600 --> 20:12.680]  And so that just made me, I had the caregiver mindset.
[20:12.680 --> 20:14.800]  So, um, people sought me out.
[20:14.800 --> 20:19.560]  So what I would say, how, you know, when you're ready, are people, um, are there people in
[20:19.560 --> 20:22.760]  need of medical cannabis knocking down your door for the weed?
[20:22.760 --> 20:26.520]  Are there people, have you made a relationship with one or two people who just really love
[20:26.520 --> 20:27.520]  what you do?
[20:27.520 --> 20:28.520]  Because that's all it takes.
[20:28.520 --> 20:32.580]  Like, like I said, my buddy, Mike, so we'll say Mike, Kevin and pops were probably three
[20:32.580 --> 20:36.880]  of my main patients that I took care of that I was provided their caregiver, uh, signed
[20:36.880 --> 20:38.180]  their caregiver.
[20:38.180 --> 20:40.980]  Those three dudes will tell you that I grew the best weed they've ever smoked.
[20:40.980 --> 20:43.660]  Uh, those three guys, that's why I was their caregiver.
[20:43.660 --> 20:46.340]  I was their friend and I also grew the best herb they could smoke.
[20:46.340 --> 20:50.060]  So if you've got somebody that's saying, Hey Matt, do you have any more of that weed you
[20:50.060 --> 20:51.060]  grew?
[20:51.060 --> 20:52.260]  Hey Matt, do you have any more of that weed you grew?
[20:52.260 --> 20:55.380]  That one thing you grow is the only thing that makes me feel better.
[20:55.380 --> 20:58.000]  That's when it's time for you to step up and become a caregiver.
[20:58.000 --> 20:59.820]  But there comes great responsibility.
[20:59.820 --> 21:04.820]  Can you provide the product which that patient requires on the timeline, which they require
[21:04.820 --> 21:05.820]  it?
[21:05.820 --> 21:06.820]  Do they smoke an ounce a week?
[21:06.820 --> 21:08.540]  Do they smoke two ounces a week?
[21:08.540 --> 21:11.220]  Can you handle that demand sustainably?
[21:11.220 --> 21:15.540]  Maybe for a month or two you can do it, but can you do it for the next three to five years
[21:15.540 --> 21:19.780]  without missing a beat to keep that person medicated perfectly and beautifully?
[21:19.780 --> 21:21.300]  Can you grow like a, what's it called?
[21:21.300 --> 21:25.020]  A surplus so that when you've got to go on vacation or clean up the room or if a power
[21:25.020 --> 21:30.020]  outage happens and you fucking lose a crop, can you back up a surplus enough, stockpile
[21:30.020 --> 21:33.220]  enough to make sure that person has got their medicine?
[21:33.220 --> 21:34.620]  Think about what you're able to do.
[21:34.620 --> 21:36.940]  Think about your realistic limitations.
[21:36.940 --> 21:42.500]  Can you provide a quality, a safe, ethical, quality product for this person on the timeline,
[21:42.500 --> 21:43.780]  which they require it?
[21:43.780 --> 21:47.420]  If you can build a relationship with them, find out what they need, find out what they
[21:47.420 --> 21:50.580]  like best and start providing caregiver services.
[21:50.580 --> 21:51.580]  Don't get in over your head.
[21:51.580 --> 21:53.960]  If you can do one or two people, that's cool.
[21:53.960 --> 21:55.980]  How are you going to cover the cost of this product?
[21:55.980 --> 22:00.700]  Are you going to charge them a little bit or are you going to charge other people?
[22:00.700 --> 22:02.020]  So this is in the past.
[22:02.020 --> 22:05.900]  I used to give the fucking medical patients weed for really, really cheap if not free
[22:05.900 --> 22:09.420]  and I would sell black market weed to the other people and the people that didn't have
[22:09.420 --> 22:13.380]  any medical recommendation or didn't even talk about medical weed, just the stoners
[22:13.380 --> 22:16.840]  and my bros and the gangsters, they'd pay full fucking price.
[22:16.840 --> 22:19.600]  But the patients, they would get some free shit and they would get some hookups.
[22:19.600 --> 22:21.780]  So you've got to decide how you want to run that.
[22:21.780 --> 22:23.380]  It is kind of a business.
[22:23.380 --> 22:27.220]  You've got to run this like a business, but a little bit different than a business because
[22:27.220 --> 22:30.020]  most businesses kind of just run about money.
[22:30.020 --> 22:32.780]  This is all about compassion and taking care of people.
[22:32.780 --> 22:34.900]  So you've got to pay attention to the people.
[22:34.900 --> 22:36.380]  How are you going to cover your own costs?
[22:36.380 --> 22:40.540]  You've got to buy soil, nutrients, lights, air, water.
[22:40.540 --> 22:41.540]  You've got to do work.
[22:41.540 --> 22:42.540]  All of that costs something.
[22:42.540 --> 22:44.060]  Are they going to pay for that?
[22:44.060 --> 22:45.520]  Will it be a donation basis?
[22:45.520 --> 22:48.640]  Will they give you so much a month and you let them have what they need?
[22:48.640 --> 22:51.380]  Think about that before you even get into it.
[22:51.380 --> 22:52.380]  Talk to them about it.
[22:52.380 --> 22:54.940]  Be like, hey, Rasta Jeff said we should talk about this.
[22:54.940 --> 22:57.020]  Starting conversations is awkward.
[22:57.020 --> 23:00.900]  Say Rasta Jeff said we should talk about this before I be your caregiver or fucking
[23:00.900 --> 23:04.140]  play this episode and be like, hey, here's the things we should talk about.
[23:04.140 --> 23:05.140]  Are you going to pay for it?
[23:05.140 --> 23:06.140]  How much do you need?
[23:06.140 --> 23:07.140]  How much do you want?
[23:07.140 --> 23:08.540]  How do I get compensated?
[23:08.540 --> 23:12.500]  Talk about all those things and figure it out so that you can still be friends if something
[23:12.500 --> 23:13.500]  does go wrong.
[23:13.500 --> 23:17.140]  That's the most important part of all that is that we're all still friends after all
[23:17.140 --> 23:18.140]  the chips fall.
[23:18.140 --> 23:21.260]  So that's how I think you know when you're ready.
[23:21.260 --> 23:25.780]  When you have a customer or a client or a friend requesting your product and you've
[23:25.780 --> 23:30.580]  got faith in yourself that you can provide that product consistently.
[23:30.580 --> 23:34.860]  Advice on scaling up.
[23:34.860 --> 23:36.940]  One of the most important things is electricity.
[23:36.940 --> 23:37.980]  Can your house handle it?
[23:37.980 --> 23:41.300]  Can your building facility wherever you're growing, you said a home grower, I'm imagining
[23:41.300 --> 23:42.420]  you're in a home.
[23:42.420 --> 23:44.420]  Can your home handle that?
[23:44.420 --> 23:49.100]  Also are you ready to have, so cannabis is a commodity.
[23:49.100 --> 23:50.300]  It's a valuable commodity.
[23:50.300 --> 23:52.060]  It's a profitable product.
[23:52.060 --> 23:57.980]  You're entering the arena of having a profitable product on hand in your home and it sounds
[23:57.980 --> 24:02.100]  like you're about to upscale the amount of that product you have and is being produced
[24:02.100 --> 24:07.980]  which will make you double, triple, quadruple the size of a target which you already are.
[24:07.980 --> 24:09.260]  People may not know you're growing.
[24:09.260 --> 24:14.060]  Law enforcement, thieves, crooks, crackheads, none of them may know that you're growing
[24:14.060 --> 24:17.500]  but when you start scaling up things will become more obvious and more apparent.
[24:17.500 --> 24:19.780]  There'll be more people coming and going from your home.
[24:19.780 --> 24:21.460]  There'll be more electricity.
[24:21.460 --> 24:22.460]  There'll be more sound.
[24:22.460 --> 24:24.100]  You'll be buying more products.
[24:24.100 --> 24:27.900]  If you make some money, be careful that when you make money you don't come up too fast
[24:27.900 --> 24:30.780]  and show people that you got a brand new car and a bunch of chains.
[24:30.780 --> 24:33.260]  If you're in a place where you shouldn't be making a little bit of money, that's when
[24:33.260 --> 24:34.960]  things do happen to you.
[24:34.960 --> 24:39.540]  I think one of my first pieces of advice would be to don't scale up.
[24:39.540 --> 24:40.820]  Maximize what you have got.
[24:40.820 --> 24:41.820]  Dial it in.
[24:41.820 --> 24:46.180]  Get the room, the space, the environment that you have got to its full potential.
[24:46.180 --> 24:49.700]  If you're pulling one pound now, try to get two pounds out of it.
[24:49.700 --> 24:52.100]  If you're getting two, aim for four.
[24:52.100 --> 24:57.460]  Maximize that before you even consider moving up to a bigger grow and adding more equipment,
[24:57.460 --> 25:02.060]  more toys, more money, more responsibility, more opportunity for failure.
[25:02.060 --> 25:04.100]  You're going to have people relying on you.
[25:04.100 --> 25:08.580]  So if this crop does fail, it's going to be more detrimental than if your personal smoke
[25:08.580 --> 25:09.580]  failed.
[25:09.580 --> 25:10.580]  You can go to the dispensary.
[25:10.580 --> 25:14.300]  You can hit up one of the homies and get some black market herb if you need to.
[25:14.300 --> 25:16.220]  But this person, they're relying on you.
[25:16.220 --> 25:17.780]  So you have got to produce that product.
[25:17.780 --> 25:19.060]  I said black market.
[25:19.060 --> 25:20.300]  Is that politically correct anymore?
[25:20.300 --> 25:22.460]  Is that the gray market, the free market?
[25:22.460 --> 25:23.820]  You know what I mean.
[25:23.820 --> 25:24.820]  That's where I'm talking about.
[25:24.820 --> 25:27.340]  You may have to go get your product if your crop fails.
[25:27.340 --> 25:29.700]  Our patients do not have that opportunity.
[25:29.700 --> 25:31.340]  They're relying on us.
[25:31.340 --> 25:33.700]  They know that we're growing that product safely.
[25:33.700 --> 25:35.220]  We know that it's the strain they want.
[25:35.220 --> 25:38.580]  They know that it's the potency they want at the frequency that they need it.
[25:38.580 --> 25:40.440]  So they're going to rely on you.
[25:40.440 --> 25:44.260]  Don't scale up too big and fuck things up because that does happen quite a bit.
[25:44.260 --> 25:47.700]  When you are scaling up, make sure that your electricity can handle it.
[25:47.820 --> 25:48.820]  Make sure that you can handle it.
[25:48.820 --> 25:50.300]  Is it too much work?
[25:50.300 --> 25:51.300]  Think about harvest time.
[25:51.300 --> 25:53.820]  Do you have a trim crew that can manage that harvest?
[25:53.820 --> 25:55.380]  Will that be possible?
[25:55.380 --> 25:58.020]  I would say scale up to one light next.
[25:58.020 --> 26:00.420]  Don't go from one light to four lights.
[26:00.420 --> 26:01.900]  Go from one to two.
[26:01.900 --> 26:04.940]  And then maybe from two to four.
[26:04.940 --> 26:09.020]  I think for a one man operation in a good size room, nine lights.
[26:09.020 --> 26:14.100]  And I'm talking about old thousand watt fucking HPS lights because I'm a dinosaur.
[26:14.100 --> 26:16.180]  Nine lights is probably the limit that I would do.
[26:16.180 --> 26:20.300]  If you got like nine R specs in a room, that's going to be a killer fucking room.
[26:20.300 --> 26:24.820]  That's probably the amount of work that I would expect one person to do in a cultivation
[26:24.820 --> 26:25.820]  in a home.
[26:25.820 --> 26:28.740]  After that, it's going to get a little bit crazy and a little bit hectic.
[26:28.740 --> 26:31.180]  So scale up slowly.
[26:31.180 --> 26:33.340]  Dial everything in before you add more.
[26:33.340 --> 26:34.340]  Learn everything.
[26:34.340 --> 26:36.900]  Get it perfect before you add more.
[26:36.900 --> 26:38.220]  Learn how to scrog everything.
[26:38.220 --> 26:39.860]  Learn how to trellis everything beautifully.
[26:39.860 --> 26:40.980]  Learn how to pop and twist.
[26:40.980 --> 26:42.560]  Learn how to defoliate.
[26:42.560 --> 26:43.560]  Dial in your feed.
[26:43.560 --> 26:44.560]  Dial in the lights.
[26:44.560 --> 26:45.560]  Dial in the air.
[26:45.940 --> 26:46.940]  Dial in the water.
[26:46.940 --> 26:49.180]  Get everything perfect before you expand.
[26:49.180 --> 26:50.740]  Then expand slowly.
[26:50.740 --> 26:51.740]  One light.
[26:51.740 --> 26:53.100]  Then if you've got two, then go to four.
[26:53.100 --> 26:55.140]  If you got four, then go to nine.
[26:55.140 --> 26:57.180]  That's just the way that I would do it.
[26:57.180 --> 26:58.180]  Slowly scale up.
[26:58.180 --> 27:00.500]  Make sure that your light, your house can handle it.
[27:00.500 --> 27:02.660]  And then also I'm in Colorado.
[27:02.660 --> 27:05.180]  If I set up a grow in the summer, it's going to kick ass.
[27:05.180 --> 27:07.380]  But right now in the winter, it's going to change.
[27:07.380 --> 27:08.700]  Everything will be different.
[27:08.700 --> 27:12.700]  Before you scale up, run a small grow in that room and get that room figured out.
[27:12.800 --> 27:16.640]  Get that environment figured out for a solid year before you scale up too big.
[27:16.640 --> 27:19.400]  Because you might build a room that in the winter it works perfectly.
[27:19.400 --> 27:23.200]  But when the summer comes, it gets so hot that you can't run it because you can't add
[27:23.200 --> 27:24.280]  electricity.
[27:24.280 --> 27:27.600]  You can't add air conditioner because you cannot add electricity.
[27:27.600 --> 27:28.600]  That will be a problem.
[27:28.600 --> 27:30.280]  So build up slowly.
[27:30.280 --> 27:31.280]  Let it run for a year.
[27:31.280 --> 27:32.280]  Build up again.
[27:32.280 --> 27:33.280]  Let it run for a year.
[27:33.280 --> 27:34.280]  Build up again.
[27:34.280 --> 27:36.060]  That is probably my advice for that.
[27:36.060 --> 27:37.800]  He wraps it up with, cheers man.
[27:37.800 --> 27:38.800]  Take a fat dab.
[27:38.800 --> 27:41.040]  So fat it roundhouses your eyes shut.
[27:41.260 --> 27:42.780]  Give your mom a hug for me.
[27:42.780 --> 27:44.060]  I appreciate that bro.
[27:44.060 --> 27:45.420]  I do need a big fat dab.
[27:45.420 --> 27:50.180]  I've got a little bit more recording here to do than we are going to get right on that
[27:50.180 --> 27:51.180]  one.
[27:51.180 --> 27:52.180]  All right Matt, thank you for the great question.
[27:52.180 --> 27:54.620]  You did give me flashbacks to my caregiver days.
[27:54.620 --> 27:57.540]  Got me sitting here reminiscing, thinking about some of the old school times in the
[27:57.540 --> 28:00.260]  basement when I had like 20 people down there trimming.
[28:00.260 --> 28:02.420]  Oh, those were the good old days.
[28:02.420 --> 28:03.420]  Or were they?
[28:03.420 --> 28:07.860]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers,
[28:07.860 --> 28:11.600]  bone cutters, pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out there.
[28:11.600 --> 28:16.680]  I do want to thank you once again for listening to episode 775 of the Grow From Your Heart
[28:16.680 --> 28:17.680]  podcast.
[28:17.680 --> 28:19.040]  That's actually the correct episode number.
[28:19.040 --> 28:21.760]  I do realize I said the wrong number on the last episode.
[28:21.760 --> 28:22.760]  I apologize.
[28:22.760 --> 28:25.840]  Thank you for all of the tweets and emails regarding that.
[28:25.840 --> 28:27.320]  I got it right this time.
[28:27.320 --> 28:29.760]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[28:29.760 --> 28:32.880]  If you have any questions, corrections, comments, or concerns, you know that I would love to
[28:32.880 --> 28:33.880]  hear from you.
[28:33.880 --> 28:36.880]  The email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[28:36.900 --> 28:41.860]  Make sure you support the show on Patreon at patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[28:41.860 --> 28:45.460]  Everything else is on the website, iregenetics.com.
[28:45.460 --> 28:46.860]  That is all I've got for you.
[28:46.860 --> 28:49.780]  I want to give a big shout out to my buddy Ars Kickerson.
[28:49.780 --> 28:53.060]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
