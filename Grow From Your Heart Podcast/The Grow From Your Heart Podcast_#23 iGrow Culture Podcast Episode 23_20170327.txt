[04:22.200 --> 04:27.200]  You guys might remember I ate a 350 mg edible on an episode
[04:27.200 --> 04:30.200]  Well, I've got a little bit of news that I just found
[04:30.200 --> 04:31.200]  Let me scroll to it
[04:32.200 --> 04:34.200]  And I got it right here on this page
[04:34.200 --> 04:35.200]  I'm actually going to drop the music out
[04:35.200 --> 04:36.200]  It's a little distracting for me
[04:37.200 --> 04:39.200]  Once again, shout out to Nikiti for letting me play the music
[04:39.200 --> 04:40.200]  I really appreciate that
[04:40.200 --> 04:42.200]  Let me tell you the name of the song that we're listening to
[04:42.200 --> 04:48.200]  That was the Summer Turnup 2014 Electric Dance Hall Music Volume 1 Live
[04:49.200 --> 04:51.200]  On DJ Nikiti's SoundCloud page
[04:51.200 --> 04:54.200]  There's a fucking sweet shot of DJ Nikiti DJing at Red Rocks
[04:54.200 --> 04:56.200]  He looks stylish in that shot, brother
[04:56.200 --> 04:57.200]  Much respect
[04:57.200 --> 04:58.200]  Thanks for letting me play your stuff
[04:59.200 --> 05:00.200]  So let's get down to this news article
[05:01.200 --> 05:03.200]  Excuse me, my voice is of course raspy from dabbing
[05:03.200 --> 05:06.200]  That's par for the course, right?
[05:07.200 --> 05:12.200]  So it says, tougher rules on Colorado marijuana edibles for serving size and child safety
[05:12.200 --> 05:15.200]  This article is by Eric Gorski from the Denver Post
[05:15.200 --> 05:23.200]  It says, Colorado's recreational marijuana edible manufacturers face tougher rules on potency, serving size, and packaging of their products
[05:23.200 --> 05:26.200]  Under stopgap rules adopted by state regulators Thursday
[05:26.200 --> 05:32.200]  The new guidelines, crafted in response to concerns about overconsumption by inexperienced consumers
[05:32.200 --> 05:38.200]  Will do away with bite-sized products that pack in 100 mg of the psychoactive chemical THC
[05:38.200 --> 05:41.200]  The maximum allowed by state law
[05:42.200 --> 05:44.200]  Products may contain up to 100 mg of THC
[05:44.200 --> 05:49.200]  But they must be easily broken off into pieces that have 10 mg or fewer
[05:49.200 --> 05:52.200]  The standardized edible serving size under state law
[05:52.200 --> 05:57.200]  So now we've standardized apparently 10 mg is a serving of edible cannabis
[05:57.200 --> 06:02.200]  So if you buy a 100 mg bar, they want it easily divisible in 10 pieces
[06:02.200 --> 06:08.200]  I shouldn't say names of products, but you know how a Kit Kat is already kind of separated into servings?
[06:08.200 --> 06:09.200]  That's kind of how I see they could do it
[06:09.200 --> 06:13.200]  And sorry Kit Kat that I used you, but your serving shit is perfect for my example
[06:13.200 --> 06:15.200]  Or Hershey's bar has got, they're already divided perfectly
[06:15.200 --> 06:18.200]  So that's what they're going to require of all of these pieces
[06:18.200 --> 06:23.200]  And I got to say that, that edible that I ate on the show was 350 mg
[06:23.200 --> 06:28.200]  It was small, I'm trying to measure it in my head to give, to have something to compare it to
[06:28.200 --> 06:30.200]  But it was quite tiny
[06:30.200 --> 06:35.200]  Man, I don't have anything in my range that is about the same size
[06:35.200 --> 06:39.200]  It was about the size of the top of a pill bottle cap
[06:39.200 --> 06:42.200]  Like that cap on your pill bottle was about that big
[06:42.200 --> 06:46.200]  Like an inch and a half by an inch and a half and it was slightly thick
[06:46.200 --> 06:49.200]  But the thing was, there was no way to judge
[06:49.200 --> 06:52.200]  You could break it in half I guess and kind of eyeball it
[06:52.200 --> 06:56.200]  But there was no way to really judge the size of that sort of an edible
[06:56.200 --> 07:00.200]  So they're going to make it to where they have to be easily broken up
[07:00.200 --> 07:05.200]  And then that way you eat 10 mg instead of trying to guess and instead of getting wrecked
[07:05.200 --> 07:09.200]  But anyway, in another change, manufacturers will be required to put single serving edibles
[07:09.200 --> 07:12.200]  And child resistant packaging before shipping them to stores
[07:12.200 --> 07:17.200]  Instead of relying on stores to provide the packaging as customers leave with their purchases
[07:17.200 --> 07:20.200]  So I think that means more costs also, that's going to go up
[07:20.200 --> 07:23.200]  Because the manufacturer now has to pay for that
[07:23.200 --> 07:27.200]  And then that's just going to get moved right on down the line to the dispensary
[07:27.200 --> 07:29.200]  And that's going to get pushed right on down the line to you
[07:29.200 --> 07:33.200]  Because now you're able to bring in, they give you this big white
[07:33.200 --> 07:36.200]  It looks like a money envelope, kind of like a bank bag
[07:36.200 --> 07:39.200]  But it's got a child resistant zipper thing on it
[07:39.200 --> 07:42.200]  It's got like a clasp on the zipper that you have to know how to open
[07:42.200 --> 07:46.200]  And if you bring that, you can put all of your edibles and stuff in there
[07:46.200 --> 07:48.200]  And they let that count as your child proof container
[07:48.200 --> 07:52.200]  And actually you can buy those or they charge you for them at a lot of the dispensaries
[07:52.200 --> 07:55.200]  So they're just going to go put that right on the product already
[07:55.200 --> 07:57.200]  You're going to pay a little more
[07:57.200 --> 08:01.200]  But I guess a couple of bucks to keep kids safe is what we got to do
[08:01.200 --> 08:03.200]  And then you get into the argument of what about parenting
[08:03.200 --> 08:06.200]  It's not all about the products, it's about the parenting
[08:06.200 --> 08:08.200]  But that's another argument
[08:08.200 --> 08:10.200]  Probably a whole other podcast that talks about that
[08:10.200 --> 08:12.200]  So the rules, this one says
[08:12.200 --> 08:17.200]  The rules, which still must be made permanent in a process that will include public comment
[08:17.200 --> 08:19.200]  Will go into effect November 1st
[08:19.200 --> 08:25.200]  They grew out of meetings with health officials, regulators, industry representatives and activists on both sides
[08:25.200 --> 08:29.200]  The Marijuana Enforcement Division's primary concern is to ensure public safety
[08:29.200 --> 08:33.200]  Atrice Bryant, a spokeswoman for the Department of Revenue, wrote in an email
[08:33.200 --> 08:40.200]  Marijuana Enforcement Division feels that clear serving size requirements within the industry is a vital part of responsible regulation
[08:41.200 --> 08:46.200]  Rachel O'Brien, a founding member of Smart Colorado, which supports tighter restrictions on marijuana
[08:46.200 --> 08:51.200]  Said the rules are a step in the right direction, but time will tell whether they go far enough
[08:51.200 --> 08:58.200]  Edibles manufacturers responding to public demand already shifted to lower potency edibles since recreational sales began January 1st
[08:58.200 --> 09:02.200]  Said Mike Elliott, executive director of the Marijuana Industry Group
[09:02.200 --> 09:06.200]  The free market has largely addressed this problem, he said
[09:06.200 --> 09:11.200]  Well I kind of agree, that 350 mg edible that I ate, it fucked me up
[09:11.200 --> 09:14.200]  And I'm a professional pot smoker, I take dabs all day
[09:14.200 --> 09:17.200]  I wake and bake on a regular basis
[09:18.200 --> 09:21.200]  I'm not bragging about how much I smoke or anything, but I get down
[09:21.200 --> 09:23.200]  I'm smoking live resin right now
[09:23.200 --> 09:26.200]  I probably took a couple of half gram dabs today
[09:26.200 --> 09:29.200]  And that edible wrecked me
[09:29.200 --> 09:34.200]  So if a normal civilian got a hold of that thing and ate the whole thing, they'd be destroyed
[09:34.200 --> 09:36.200]  And they would have a miserable experience
[09:36.200 --> 09:40.200]  So I think clearly marking it is key, that's a great idea
[09:40.200 --> 09:45.200]  We all remember the story of the lady from New York, Maureen O'Dowd
[09:45.200 --> 09:50.200]  That ate too much edibles and thought she was fucking turning herself inside out and dying in her hotel room
[09:50.200 --> 09:52.200]  Nobody wants to be that guy
[09:52.200 --> 09:54.200]  Well guys I think that's enough news for the day
[09:54.200 --> 09:56.200]  I just kind of wanted to read you that one article
[09:56.200 --> 09:59.200]  Jesse came over, we did a little outdoor grow lesson
[09:59.200 --> 10:02.200]  Sounds like my voice is about to blow out anyway
[10:02.200 --> 10:05.200]  So I'm going to turn up the music and then we'll be back with the grow lesson
[10:05.200 --> 10:07.200]  Thanks for joining us, hang on for just one second
[10:07.200 --> 10:10.200]  Hey if you got a dabber, if you got a joint, if you got a bowl
[10:10.200 --> 10:13.200]  If you got an edible, if you've got a drinkable
[10:13.200 --> 10:15.200]  If you've got some topical
[10:15.200 --> 10:18.200]  Hey, consume that at this time because I'm going to take a dab
[10:18.200 --> 10:22.200]  And that means that kind of technically we are getting high together
[10:22.200 --> 10:27.200]  So when this music starts, count to about 30 and that means we're getting high together right about then
[10:27.200 --> 10:28.200]  Here we go
[10:43.200 --> 10:56.070]  Alright guys, you got the nail hot, you got your bowl packed, you got a joint rolled, you got something going on
[10:56.070 --> 10:57.070]  Let's get stoned together
[10:57.070 --> 11:01.070]  I'm going to take a dab, I'm taking a dab of some Girl Scout Cookies Live Resin made by a close friend
[11:01.070 --> 11:09.070]  I'm going to hit a Hitman Mini Cake with a highly educated, it's the Infiniti nail hooked up to an e-nail
[11:09.070 --> 11:15.070]  It's the old Temp Temple because at one point I had arranged a sponsorship deal or something with the Temp Temple
[11:15.070 --> 11:20.070]  But they've since sold the company so I've got the Temp Temple, it's set at 460, I like it
[11:20.070 --> 11:22.070]  That's just about right I think
[11:22.070 --> 11:29.070]  I've also got a highly educated titanium carb cap so I'm going to drop the dab onto the nail and then pop the carb cap on
[11:29.070 --> 11:31.070]  So get high with me guys, here we go
[11:31.070 --> 11:41.720]  Alright, we'll be right back in just a second with Jesse's Outdoor Grow Lesson
[11:42.720 --> 12:15.240]  Yo, what's up ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the show
[12:15.240 --> 12:18.240]  Hey, I've got Jesse back, we're going to do another grow lesson
[12:19.240 --> 12:23.240]  Before we do that, man I want to say congratulations on the air, Jesse just got married
[12:23.240 --> 12:26.240]  His wedding was awesome, I'm sure you've heard his talk about it
[12:26.240 --> 12:28.240]  So welcome to the show and congratulations bro
[12:28.240 --> 12:29.240]  Thank you, thank you
[12:29.240 --> 12:32.240]  You look like a new man, your hair is halfway combed
[12:32.240 --> 12:34.240]  You've got a big ol' smile on your face
[12:34.240 --> 12:36.240]  Got a haircut, groomed the beard a little
[12:36.240 --> 12:39.240]  Oh, I wasn't going to mention the grooming of the beard
[12:39.240 --> 12:42.240]  Did you have to get refitted for your dress after they groomed your beard?
[12:44.240 --> 12:46.240]  No, because it still stayed in place
[12:46.240 --> 12:48.240]  His beard is manly as fuck you guys
[12:48.240 --> 12:52.240]  If you'll let me post a picture of him, we'll put a picture up on the Instagram or somewhere
[12:52.240 --> 12:54.240]  So you guys can see what a man beard looks like
[12:55.240 --> 12:56.240]  For sure
[12:56.240 --> 12:57.240]  Colorado man beard
[12:58.240 --> 13:00.240]  Turn myself up a little, I'm not loud enough, sorry it's an ego thing
[13:00.240 --> 13:02.240]  I've got to come up more on the computer here
[13:02.240 --> 13:03.240]  Awesome
[13:03.240 --> 13:07.240]  So Jesse is part of the Hygro store, his wife works there
[13:07.240 --> 13:11.240]  How involved are you? Are you an employee or are you just kind of helping behind the scenes?
[13:11.240 --> 13:20.240]  I am a helping behind the scenes, helping with training employees on product lines and stuff
[13:20.240 --> 13:27.240]  I'm also doing commercial sales for dispensaries, caregiver grows, stuff like that
[13:27.240 --> 13:32.240]  So, get at me, I'll beat anyone's price
[13:32.240 --> 13:35.240]  It's an ego thing, speaking of egos
[13:35.240 --> 13:38.240]  I'm pushing the mic closer to his face so you guys can hear him a little bit better
[13:38.240 --> 13:40.240]  I'll turn me down and him up, that'll make this happen
[13:41.240 --> 13:45.240]  So speaking of Hygro, a couple of people that have been listening to the podcast kind of called us out
[13:45.240 --> 13:50.240]  They said 550 bucks for a tote of soil, if I go online that's only 299 dollars
[13:51.240 --> 13:53.240]  They're correct, I did some research
[13:53.240 --> 13:59.240]  The caveat is if you pay 299 dollars, shipping is 249 dollars
[13:59.240 --> 14:01.240]  Because it's got to be shipped on a FedEx truck
[14:02.240 --> 14:06.240]  We were just talking about how big a tote of soil is
[14:06.240 --> 14:08.240]  It's about the size of a Volkswagen
[14:09.240 --> 14:13.240]  It's probably 3.5-4 feet wide by 3.5-4 feet tall
[14:13.240 --> 14:16.240]  Depending on how much it's been compressed
[14:16.240 --> 14:20.240]  Because it is going to be kind of squished down by gravity and being moved around
[14:20.240 --> 14:21.240]  They're heavy as shit
[14:21.240 --> 14:24.240]  How are they getting that off the truck when they bring it to your house?
[14:24.240 --> 14:28.240]  With a pallet jack, right to your front yard
[14:28.240 --> 14:30.240]  So figure it out from there
[14:30.240 --> 14:32.240]  Yeah, nowhere it's going to go when they get there
[14:32.240 --> 14:35.240]  Maybe you can sweet talk the guy into getting it there
[14:36.240 --> 14:38.240]  This show is brought to you by Hygro and or Growing Supplies
[14:38.240 --> 14:39.240]  Make sure you check out Hygro
[14:39.240 --> 14:41.240]  I'm pretty sure I already said that once in the show
[14:41.240 --> 14:43.240]  But I like giving them love because they give us a lot of love
[14:44.240 --> 14:47.240]  Jesse's back, he's going to give us a grow lesson
[14:47.240 --> 14:49.240]  We should review a little bit of what we've done
[14:50.240 --> 14:54.240]  By now we should have some big ass bushes that are in the veg stage, right?
[14:54.240 --> 14:55.240]  Oh yeah, yeah
[14:55.240 --> 14:57.240]  We've talked a little bit about feeding
[14:57.240 --> 14:59.240]  We've talked about top dressing a little tiny bit
[14:59.240 --> 15:00.240]  We're going to talk more about that
[15:01.240 --> 15:02.240]  We should have them kind of
[15:03.240 --> 15:06.240]  We're about to start the bloom phase and the stretch phase
[15:06.240 --> 15:09.240]  So if we want to top them and do some training
[15:09.240 --> 15:11.240]  Now is kind of our last chance
[15:11.240 --> 15:12.240]  We should stop topping by now, right?
[15:12.240 --> 15:15.240]  Unless we've got plants that are going to clear the fence
[15:15.240 --> 15:20.240]  Yeah, unless heights a concern and that's your motivation for topping
[15:22.240 --> 15:26.240]  In that case, by all means, do what you need to do to get your crop in
[15:26.240 --> 15:28.240]  Yeah, you don't want the neighbors seeing that shit
[15:28.240 --> 15:31.240]  You don't want the people walking down the street to see that shit
[15:32.240 --> 15:37.240]  If you don't have to do it, we can pull the plants down a little bit
[15:37.240 --> 15:40.240]  If you have been taking care of it, you should be able to grab some branches
[15:40.240 --> 15:43.240]  The tall ones, and just pull them down
[15:43.240 --> 15:45.240]  And then maybe tie them to a stake
[15:45.240 --> 15:48.240]  Or maybe tie them to something in the garden that's already there
[15:48.240 --> 15:50.240]  Like a rock or something
[15:50.240 --> 15:52.240]  You can use a stake in the ground
[15:52.240 --> 15:53.240]  I use big bamboo poles
[15:53.240 --> 15:56.240]  Just spread that plant out to where instead of growing straight up
[15:56.240 --> 15:58.240]  You kind of got it growing a little horizontally
[15:58.240 --> 15:59.240]  Now's your time to get it going
[15:59.240 --> 16:03.240]  Because I think within the next 10 days here
[16:03.240 --> 16:06.240]  Everyone's going to go into flower real heavily
[16:06.240 --> 16:07.240]  Yeah, I believe so
[16:07.240 --> 16:14.240]  I've got a strain that's Tom Hill's Deep Chunk crossed with G13
[16:14.240 --> 16:15.240]  Sorry, I fixed that noise guys
[16:15.240 --> 16:16.240]  I couldn't find it
[16:16.240 --> 16:17.240]  I just noticed it
[16:17.240 --> 16:19.240]  It's so much better with my headphones
[16:21.240 --> 16:25.240]  I've got a strain that's got some kind of land-raised stuff in it
[16:25.240 --> 16:28.240]  And it has started flowering
[16:29.240 --> 16:30.240]  It actually snuck up on me
[16:30.240 --> 16:33.240]  And I had to take clones that are kind of pre-flowering
[16:33.240 --> 16:35.240]  So guys, that's one thing we're going to talk about
[16:35.240 --> 16:37.240]  Get clones
[16:37.240 --> 16:39.240]  If you've got some outdoor plants
[16:39.240 --> 16:41.240]  And you're waiting for them to go and flower
[16:41.240 --> 16:43.240]  And you need some clones for them so you can grow next year
[16:43.240 --> 16:45.240]  Get clones now
[16:45.240 --> 16:48.240]  I always say, and this is, I'm going to go off on a little side rant here
[16:48.240 --> 16:50.240]  I warned Jesse there'd be a rant about this
[16:50.240 --> 16:53.240]  If you're growing from seed or a clone that is brand new to you
[16:53.240 --> 16:55.240]  Take some clones before you go into flower
[16:56.240 --> 16:58.240]  It's really frustrating when you grow a plant
[16:58.240 --> 16:59.240]  And it's done
[16:59.240 --> 17:01.240]  And you smoke it with some of your friends
[17:01.240 --> 17:03.240]  And they're like, what the hell is this?
[17:03.240 --> 17:04.240]  And you're like, it's the best
[17:04.240 --> 17:05.240]  And you all agree
[17:05.240 --> 17:07.240]  And they go, I can't wait until you grow it even better next time
[17:07.240 --> 17:09.240]  And you go, oh yeah, I don't have a clone of that
[17:09.240 --> 17:11.240]  So we're never going to get to taste this ever again
[17:11.240 --> 17:13.240]  Except this one round
[17:13.240 --> 17:15.240]  That's the most frustrating, heart-breaking feeling
[17:15.240 --> 17:17.240]  So, take clones you guys
[17:17.240 --> 17:19.240]  Definitely take clones from everything that you grow
[17:19.240 --> 17:21.240]  If you've got the option
[17:21.240 --> 17:25.240]  That's some killer advice from a seed company owner
[17:25.240 --> 17:27.240]  Well yeah, I'd want you to buy more seeds, right?
[17:27.240 --> 17:29.240]  But what if you find that keeper?
[17:29.240 --> 17:31.240]  What if you get that, or how about when you do get that?
[17:31.240 --> 17:33.240]  Blackjack-type keeper
[17:33.240 --> 17:35.240]  That is harvest heavy
[17:35.240 --> 17:37.240]  It tastes dank
[17:37.240 --> 17:38.240]  It fucking gets you high as hell
[17:38.240 --> 17:40.240]  You're going to wish you had a clone of that
[17:40.240 --> 17:42.240]  I'll wish you had a clone of it too
[17:42.240 --> 17:44.240]  Because I want to cut when I find you at the cannabis club or something
[17:44.240 --> 17:46.240]  I need a clone of that one
[17:46.240 --> 17:48.240]  So get some clones all the time
[17:48.240 --> 17:50.240]  I'm glad you mentioned the seed company thing
[17:50.240 --> 17:52.240]  That's sound advice right there if I'm a seed guy
[17:52.240 --> 17:54.240]  Yeah, for sure
[17:54.240 --> 17:58.240]  So, we were talking about getting those plants below the fence line
[17:58.240 --> 18:00.240]  You can do the low stress technique
[18:00.240 --> 18:03.240]  You can do a little bit of super cropping like Soma does
[18:03.240 --> 18:05.240]  Kind of crack them and bend them a little bit
[18:05.240 --> 18:07.240]  Now's your last chance really
[18:07.240 --> 18:09.240]  Because you're going into flower in about 10 days
[18:09.240 --> 18:11.240]  And I really don't like to mess with plants
[18:11.240 --> 18:13.240]  There are hormones in your plants
[18:13.240 --> 18:16.240]  Oxins and cytokinins that move around with
[18:16.240 --> 18:19.240]  They find the tops of the plants and affect the top of the plant
[18:19.240 --> 18:21.240]  And the way that stuff grows
[18:21.240 --> 18:23.240]  You don't want to disrupt that right now
[18:23.240 --> 18:25.240]  That will freak your plants out a little bit
[18:25.240 --> 18:27.240]  Yeah, mess up bud sizes
[18:27.240 --> 18:30.240]  Yeah, but you can still kind of pull them down
[18:30.240 --> 18:32.240]  And low stress training them
[18:32.240 --> 18:35.240]  But you don't want to go and kick their ass real bad or anything
[18:35.240 --> 18:39.240]  I've had one of my first seasons growing outdoors
[18:39.240 --> 18:42.240]  I didn't top and all the plants were from seeds
[18:42.240 --> 18:45.240]  So the Mary stem, you know, was just
[18:45.240 --> 18:47.240]  Or the main stalk was
[18:47.240 --> 18:50.240]  You know, just as straight as could be
[18:50.240 --> 18:53.240]  And I tied a rope around the top of the
[18:53.240 --> 18:55.240]  Sorry, keep up
[18:55.240 --> 18:56.240]  I'm turning to you
[18:56.240 --> 18:58.240]  I'm ducking and weaving on the microphone
[18:58.240 --> 19:00.240]  I keep doing it too, I'm high today
[19:00.240 --> 19:01.240]  Jesse brought over some live resin
[19:01.240 --> 19:02.240]  Really high
[19:02.240 --> 19:04.240]  Oh, you gotta like the live resin
[19:04.240 --> 19:06.240]  Yeah, some unicorn hash
[19:06.240 --> 19:08.240]  The unicorn hash, yeah
[19:08.240 --> 19:10.240]  So the ones you did from seeds
[19:10.240 --> 19:14.240]  Yeah, but I tied the rope around the top of the plant
[19:14.240 --> 19:16.240]  And just pulled the whole freaking thing down
[19:16.240 --> 19:18.240]  Almost made like a bow and arrow looking thing
[19:18.240 --> 19:19.240]  Yeah, exactly
[19:19.240 --> 19:23.240]  And the result was just like this whole head row of buds
[19:23.240 --> 19:24.240]  It was super cool
[19:24.240 --> 19:26.240]  All the side branches took over and started
[19:26.240 --> 19:28.240]  They all went up as lateral tops
[19:28.240 --> 19:30.240]  Yeah, talking about the hormones and stuff like that
[19:30.240 --> 19:33.240]  Yeah, cannabis wants one dominant top on the plant
[19:33.240 --> 19:35.240]  Something, I know what it is, but I'm not gonna
[19:35.240 --> 19:37.240]  We'll go, I'm trying to go slowly with the listeners
[19:37.240 --> 19:38.240]  And get everybody up to speed
[19:38.240 --> 19:40.240]  And not try to Ed Rosenthal people
[19:40.240 --> 19:43.240]  When you talk to Ed, he forgets that we're not all doctors
[19:43.240 --> 19:44.240]  And he just starts
[19:44.240 --> 19:45.240]  Rocket scientist
[19:45.240 --> 19:46.240]  He's a weed scientist
[19:46.240 --> 19:47.240]  And he'll just blow your mind
[19:47.240 --> 19:48.240]  So I'm trying to go slow for you guys
[19:48.240 --> 19:50.240]  We'll talk about the auxins and cytokinins
[19:50.240 --> 19:52.240]  And the other hormones and plants that make them want to grow
[19:52.240 --> 19:53.240]  A top bud
[19:53.240 --> 19:55.240]  But when you cut out that top bud
[19:55.240 --> 19:56.240]  All the other bottom buds go
[19:56.240 --> 19:57.240]  Hey, I've got the opportunity
[19:57.240 --> 19:59.240]  It's like when you kill the leader
[19:59.240 --> 20:03.240]  All the little tribesmen think that they could be the leader now
[20:03.240 --> 20:05.240]  And that's kind of what the bottom buds do
[20:05.240 --> 20:07.240]  So if you've got that plant
[20:07.240 --> 20:09.240]  Pull it over like a fishing pole would bend when you got a fish
[20:09.240 --> 20:11.240]  All those little branches that you've got
[20:11.240 --> 20:14.240]  Those little sucker buds that often times we cut off
[20:14.240 --> 20:15.240]  Those will create nice little bud sites
[20:15.240 --> 20:18.240]  Because now they've got the chance to become a top
[20:18.240 --> 20:20.240]  And they're also exposed to more light
[20:20.240 --> 20:21.240]  Yeah, oh yeah, yeah
[20:21.240 --> 20:22.240]  Cool
[20:22.240 --> 20:23.240]  It's a real neat effect
[20:23.240 --> 20:25.240]  So we should be in the stretch phase
[20:25.240 --> 20:26.240]  Or starting to pre-flower, right?
[20:26.240 --> 20:28.240]  Yeah, oh totally, yeah
[20:28.240 --> 20:30.240]  Are you doing anything for bugs now?
[20:32.240 --> 20:35.240]  I spray with neem oil
[20:35.240 --> 20:38.240]  And I just did it the last time
[20:39.240 --> 20:41.240]  As soon as I notice flower
[20:42.240 --> 20:44.240]  I really don't, especially outdoors
[20:44.240 --> 20:47.240]  I really don't like spraying the plant with anything
[20:47.240 --> 20:48.240]  Me too
[20:48.240 --> 20:53.240]  So I stop the kelp mills, compost tea sprays
[20:53.240 --> 20:56.240]  And the neem oil sprays
[20:57.240 --> 20:58.240]  I do that individually
[20:58.240 --> 21:00.240]  I don't just stop the whole garden
[21:00.240 --> 21:03.240]  As each strain starts flowering
[21:03.240 --> 21:05.240]  It's like, oh, can't spray that plant anymore
[21:05.240 --> 21:06.240]  So, you know
[21:10.240 --> 21:12.240]  In southern Colorado we're getting a lot of rain right now
[21:12.240 --> 21:14.240]  And there's some weird bugs popping up
[21:14.240 --> 21:17.240]  Yeah, little flying critters I've never seen
[21:17.240 --> 21:19.240]  Yeah, stuff's going to be out of balance
[21:19.240 --> 21:23.240]  I personally haven't noticed any
[21:23.240 --> 21:26.240]  Them being plant predators
[21:26.240 --> 21:29.240]  But it could be
[21:30.240 --> 21:31.240]  Those things are going to look for homes
[21:31.240 --> 21:32.240]  And they're going to lay eggs
[21:32.240 --> 21:34.240]  Because they're normal homes for laying eggs
[21:34.240 --> 21:35.240]  They're going to be disrupted
[21:35.240 --> 21:37.240]  And you're going to have to go look under your leaves
[21:37.240 --> 21:39.240]  And if you find some shit, put on some gloves
[21:39.240 --> 21:40.240]  And just clean them out of there
[21:40.240 --> 21:42.240]  Just clean that stuff out
[21:42.240 --> 21:44.240]  If you're a hippie and you want to give those bugs a new home
[21:44.240 --> 21:46.240]  Feel free to relocate them
[21:46.240 --> 21:47.240]  Fuck those bugs
[21:47.240 --> 21:48.240]  Fuck, yeah
[21:48.240 --> 21:50.240]  I'd throw them in the fucking burn if it were me
[21:50.240 --> 21:52.240]  Compost pile, feed them to the chickens
[21:52.240 --> 21:54.240]  Oh, I bet your chickens would love you for that
[21:54.240 --> 21:56.240]  How are you dealing with all the rain?
[21:56.240 --> 21:58.240]  Because it has been raining every day
[21:58.240 --> 22:00.240]  From about 6 o'clock to 9 o'clock for the past week
[22:00.240 --> 22:03.240]  Until today when it was fucking sweltering hot
[22:03.240 --> 22:04.240]  Once again
[22:04.240 --> 22:06.240]  I keep my plants hollowed out
[22:06.240 --> 22:09.240]  So, you know, the foliage on the inside
[22:11.240 --> 22:13.240]  There isn't really any
[22:14.240 --> 22:16.240]  Even in veg, I do that
[22:16.240 --> 22:19.240]  Especially as it gets later in veg
[22:20.240 --> 22:22.240]  And you guys will learn where to cut up your plants a little bit
[22:22.240 --> 22:25.240]  That helps, I think, a lot
[22:25.240 --> 22:28.240]  The biggest thing the rain has been doing to me
[22:28.240 --> 22:31.240]  Is saving me from having to water my plants
[22:32.240 --> 22:36.240]  So, my main outdoor garden is in a depression
[22:36.240 --> 22:39.240]  So a couple acres drain into it
[22:39.240 --> 22:41.240]  Works out real nice
[22:41.240 --> 22:43.240]  Plenty of water for the plants
[22:43.240 --> 22:44.240]  There you go
[22:44.240 --> 22:45.240]  I have yet to be out there
[22:45.240 --> 22:46.240]  So, hint, hint
[22:46.240 --> 22:48.240]  We need to go on a short little road trip
[22:48.240 --> 22:52.240]  I just bought my dad his first dab rig
[22:52.240 --> 22:53.240]  Oh man
[22:53.240 --> 22:55.240]  I got to meet your dad at the wedding
[22:55.240 --> 22:57.240]  I thought that was who he was
[22:57.240 --> 22:59.240]  He didn't introduce himself
[22:59.240 --> 23:00.240]  It was loud
[23:00.240 --> 23:02.240]  He woke up, shook my hand, nodded at me
[23:02.240 --> 23:05.240]  And gave me a man handshake and a man nod
[23:05.240 --> 23:07.240]  Like, you're welcome, I like you
[23:07.240 --> 23:08.240]  And he walked away
[23:08.240 --> 23:09.240]  And he didn't speak
[23:09.240 --> 23:11.240]  Because it was so loud where we were
[23:11.240 --> 23:13.240]  I wouldn't have heard him if he did speak
[23:13.240 --> 23:16.240]  And I was like, that's probably Pops right there
[23:16.240 --> 23:17.240]  But I'm not certain
[23:17.240 --> 23:20.240]  And he beams this energy of
[23:20.240 --> 23:22.240]  You fucking respect me
[23:22.240 --> 23:24.240]  That's just what comes off of him
[23:24.240 --> 23:26.240]  You do respect me
[23:27.240 --> 23:29.240]  And I don't want to know what will happen if I don't
[23:29.240 --> 23:31.240]  Because I have no intention
[23:31.240 --> 23:34.240]  But he just looks like a man that commands a little bit of respect
[23:34.240 --> 23:36.240]  Yeah, he's a...
[23:36.240 --> 23:38.240]  In his younger days he was...
[23:39.240 --> 23:41.240]  I've seen him do some stuff
[23:41.240 --> 23:43.240]  Mortal men can't do
[23:43.240 --> 23:45.240]  Well I watched him do immortal shit
[23:45.240 --> 23:47.240]  He out dabbed and out drank
[23:47.240 --> 23:49.240]  Everybody at the fucking table where he was
[23:49.240 --> 23:51.240]  And then stood up and called us youngster's pussies
[23:51.240 --> 23:53.240]  Because we couldn't keep up
[23:53.240 --> 23:55.240]  You guys gonna dab or what?
[23:55.240 --> 23:56.240]  Like, shit man
[23:56.240 --> 23:58.240]  I'm falling out of my chair dabbed out over here
[23:58.240 --> 24:00.240]  Well I could use a dab then
[24:00.240 --> 24:02.240]  Yes sir, Mr. Peranen
[24:03.240 --> 24:04.240]  He's a good guy
[24:04.240 --> 24:06.240]  I had fun though, I had fun with your whole family
[24:06.240 --> 24:07.240]  It was great, dude, that was awesome
[24:07.240 --> 24:09.240]  Your wedding will be talked about
[24:09.240 --> 24:11.240]  Not only on this podcast but in Colorado
[24:11.240 --> 24:13.240]  For years to come
[24:13.240 --> 24:15.240]  I hope so, that's what I was shooting for with it
[24:15.240 --> 24:19.240]  First dab bar in a Colorado wedding that I'm aware of
[24:19.240 --> 24:21.240]  Yeah, me too
[24:21.240 --> 24:24.240]  It was funny, the day after the wedding I saw
[24:24.240 --> 24:26.240]  I still haven't gotten to read it but the
[24:26.240 --> 24:29.240]  Washington poster, the New York Times had an article about
[24:29.240 --> 24:32.240]  Marijuana being a welcome guest at a
[24:32.240 --> 24:35.240]  Colorado and Washington wedding
[24:35.240 --> 24:37.240]  And I was like, damn
[24:37.240 --> 24:38.240]  They're right
[24:38.240 --> 24:39.240]  They're absolutely correct
[24:39.240 --> 24:41.240]  You know, usually at weddings
[24:41.240 --> 24:43.240]  And this is just a cliche thing
[24:43.240 --> 24:45.240]  There's usually one fight and it's usually like
[24:45.240 --> 24:47.240]  A sisterly thing or some shit
[24:47.240 --> 24:49.240]  Oh my god, I can't believe you
[24:49.240 --> 24:51.240]  It just gets fucking stupid and it's a drunk family member
[24:51.240 --> 24:53.240]  We didn't have that
[24:53.240 --> 24:55.240]  We actually almost did
[24:55.240 --> 24:57.240]  Derailed it, so
[24:57.240 --> 25:01.240]  Yeah, it was very chill and laid back
[25:01.240 --> 25:03.240]  Good job to everybody for getting home safely
[25:03.240 --> 25:05.240]  I watched everybody at the end of the night
[25:05.240 --> 25:07.240]  Search for rides and all the people that were sober
[25:07.240 --> 25:10.240]  Were kind enough to get all you silly drunk fuckers home
[25:10.240 --> 25:11.240]  That was cool
[25:11.240 --> 25:15.240]  We party hardy but we try to be safe as possible
[25:15.240 --> 25:17.240]  Well driving from there you had to be safe
[25:17.240 --> 25:18.240]  There were cops everywhere
[25:18.240 --> 25:20.240]  I wasn't letting no one in
[25:20.240 --> 25:22.240]  Alright guys, we're talking about a grow lesson
[25:22.240 --> 25:24.240]  We're starting to bloom
[25:24.240 --> 25:26.240]  Do you guys know what you're looking for when you're going into flower?
[25:26.240 --> 25:28.240]  Are you looking for your males? Are you looking for your females?
[25:28.240 --> 25:30.240]  Pretty soon
[25:30.240 --> 25:31.240]  Lord, I hope so
[25:31.240 --> 25:33.240]  If you're growing outdoors near us, I really hope so
[25:33.240 --> 25:35.240]  I hope you know how to find those males
[25:35.240 --> 25:37.240]  Unless it's on purpose and then right on
[25:37.240 --> 25:39.240]  Yeah, yeah
[25:39.240 --> 25:42.240]  So quickly, if you're looking for females
[25:42.240 --> 25:44.240]  It looks like they're growing a cotton ball
[25:44.240 --> 25:45.240]  When they start to flower
[25:45.240 --> 25:47.240]  It looks like you're getting a dandelion when they're making flowers
[25:47.240 --> 25:51.240]  If you've got some balls
[25:51.240 --> 25:54.240]  And literally, it looks like you're growing a little pack of bananas
[25:54.240 --> 25:56.240]  Yeah, they start green
[25:56.240 --> 25:58.240]  They start green, yeah, and then they turn into balls
[25:58.240 --> 26:00.240]  Kill those plants
[26:00.240 --> 26:02.240]  Unless you're looking to make seeds and piss off all your neighbors that grow weed
[26:02.240 --> 26:04.240]  And seed up all their crops
[26:04.240 --> 26:06.240]  Kill those male plants
[26:06.240 --> 26:08.240]  Or, yeah, just kill them
[26:08.240 --> 26:10.240]  And if you have clones, call me
[26:10.240 --> 26:12.240]  We'll see what kind of males you got
[26:12.240 --> 26:14.240]  Maybe we'll do something fun with those
[26:14.240 --> 26:17.240]  So yeah, you're looking for the, you want the dandelion looking ones
[26:17.240 --> 26:19.240]  That's the easiest way to describe it
[26:19.240 --> 26:21.240]  Honestly, you guys gotta read some books
[26:21.240 --> 26:23.240]  If you aren't familiar with males and females
[26:23.240 --> 26:25.240]  You gotta catch up a little bit
[26:25.240 --> 26:27.240]  Do a little bit of reading
[26:27.240 --> 26:29.240]  That's kind of what a grower needs to know
[26:29.240 --> 26:31.240]  That shit you should be doing
[26:31.240 --> 26:33.240]  So, identify the males, pull the males
[26:33.240 --> 26:35.240]  And even feminize seeds, keep an eye on them
[26:35.240 --> 26:37.240]  Yeah, it's, feminizing is not a 100% process
[26:37.240 --> 26:39.240]  It is not 100%, we say 99%
[26:39.240 --> 26:41.240]  Which, still there's
[26:41.240 --> 26:43.240]  Problems happen when you're making
[26:43.240 --> 26:45.240]  If you use certain methods
[26:45.240 --> 26:47.240]  You're less likely to get fems
[26:47.240 --> 26:49.240]  But if you use certain methods
[26:49.240 --> 26:51.240]  Then fems occur often
[26:51.240 --> 26:53.240]  I've seen it at a big dispensary grow
[26:53.240 --> 26:55.240]  Like 250 feminized seeds
[26:55.240 --> 26:57.240]  And they had like 4 males
[26:57.240 --> 26:59.240]  And they didn't pay attention?
[26:59.240 --> 27:01.240]  No, no, and it all got wrecked
[27:01.240 --> 27:03.240]  And the owner was quite pissed
[27:03.240 --> 27:05.240]  And, you know, it was explained to him
[27:05.240 --> 27:07.240]  You know, 99% do the math
[27:07.240 --> 27:09.240]  250 plants
[27:09.240 --> 27:11.240]  Yep, and now he's got a problem
[27:11.240 --> 27:13.240]  With feminized seeds, right?
[27:13.240 --> 27:15.240]  Yes
[27:15.240 --> 27:17.240]  I want to make sure that people hear you
[27:17.240 --> 27:19.240]  Dispensary owners, in general
[27:19.240 --> 27:21.240]  Don't like growing from seed
[27:21.240 --> 27:23.240]  The ones that do
[27:23.240 --> 27:25.240]  Mad props to you guys
[27:25.240 --> 27:27.240]  You get such great shit when you grow from seed
[27:27.240 --> 27:29.240]  You don't know what you're going to find
[27:29.240 --> 27:31.240]  And you don't have the clone
[27:31.240 --> 27:33.240]  That everybody in your neighborhood is growing
[27:33.240 --> 27:35.240]  Everybody around here right now has a damn blue dream clone
[27:35.240 --> 27:37.240]  Flow
[27:37.240 --> 27:39.240]  I kind of like that I give out flow to new growers
[27:39.240 --> 27:41.240]  If you're like, I'm new and I need to grow
[27:41.240 --> 27:43.240]  I'm like, try this flow cut
[27:43.240 --> 27:45.240]  I don't really think that cut we have is flow
[27:45.240 --> 27:47.240]  I've always thought that exact same thing
[27:47.240 --> 27:49.240]  I've heard that story
[27:49.240 --> 27:51.240]  There's somebody in Colorado that posted on Facebook
[27:51.240 --> 27:53.240]  That they know that that's flotica
[27:53.240 --> 27:55.240]  And that they actually got that cut from Ed Rosenthal
[27:55.240 --> 27:57.240]  So if you're listening to this show
[27:57.240 --> 27:59.240]  Please tweet me or Facebook me
[27:59.240 --> 28:01.240]  You can go to iRegenetics
[28:01.240 --> 28:03.240]  Or iGrowCulture on Facebook or Twitter
[28:03.240 --> 28:05.240]  Please, because I want to know more about
[28:05.240 --> 28:07.240]  The cut of flow that goes around Colorado
[28:07.240 --> 28:09.240]  There's a cut called tangerine
[28:09.240 --> 28:11.240]  That is not tangy
[28:11.240 --> 28:13.240]  It's the tang
[28:13.240 --> 28:15.240]  Man, that is so confusing
[28:15.240 --> 28:17.240]  I think that is flow and urban poison
[28:17.240 --> 28:19.240]  Okay, okay, okay
[28:19.240 --> 28:21.240]  Yeah, yeah
[28:21.240 --> 28:23.240]  Gotcha
[28:23.240 --> 28:25.240]  If anybody in Colorado knows what we're talking about
[28:25.240 --> 28:27.240]  It's not tangy, everyone calls it tang
[28:27.240 --> 28:29.240]  And they called it the tang tang or the tang tang
[28:29.240 --> 28:31.240]  For a little while around here
[28:31.240 --> 28:33.240]  I'm pretty sure that's flow and urban poison
[28:33.240 --> 28:35.240]  Tang tang
[28:35.240 --> 28:37.240]  I remember a big full spread
[28:37.240 --> 28:39.240]  Dispensary ad about that strain
[28:39.240 --> 28:41.240]  Way back in the day
[28:41.240 --> 28:43.240]  Somebody near the Fort Collins area made that one
[28:43.240 --> 28:45.240]  Really, really
[28:45.240 --> 28:47.240]  From what I know
[28:47.240 --> 28:49.240]  That's the problem with the weed world
[28:49.240 --> 28:51.240]  Because by the time I give you a clone
[28:51.240 --> 28:53.240]  The story has changed
[28:53.240 --> 28:55.240]  And then you give it to somebody else
[28:55.240 --> 28:57.240]  And the story has totally changed
[28:57.240 --> 28:59.240]  And then they pass it on and now it's not even the same strain
[28:59.240 --> 29:01.240]  And it's being whored out for way too much money
[29:01.240 --> 29:03.240]  It's not being grown to its potential
[29:03.240 --> 29:05.240]  Because it's not being called what it is
[29:05.240 --> 29:07.240]  Patients are getting jacked
[29:07.240 --> 29:09.240]  Yeah, yeah
[29:09.240 --> 29:11.240]  So we're in the stretch phase
[29:11.240 --> 29:13.240]  We're blooming, we're getting off track here
[29:13.240 --> 29:15.240]  It's cool
[29:15.240 --> 29:17.240]  They seem to like, the listeners have responded
[29:17.240 --> 29:19.240]  They like it when I get all high and just talk
[29:19.240 --> 29:21.240]  Nice, nice
[29:21.240 --> 29:23.240]  They like it when I kind of go off course
[29:23.240 --> 29:25.240]  Because I ate a big ass edible
[29:25.240 --> 29:27.240]  Oh guys, I'm so glad for that edible I ate
[29:27.240 --> 29:29.240]  I gotta tell you, I felt like shit for the whole next day though
[29:29.240 --> 29:31.240]  Eating that whole edible really took a toll on my body
[29:31.240 --> 29:33.240]  I'm getting old
[29:33.240 --> 29:35.240]  Is part of what I'm trying to say
[29:35.240 --> 29:37.240]  I'm 25 now and I think when I was 25
[29:37.240 --> 29:39.240]  I probably could have done it and not felt like shit the next day
[29:39.240 --> 29:41.240]  But I had to go get some kombucha
[29:41.240 --> 29:43.240]  And fucking eat a big fat meal
[29:43.240 --> 29:45.240]  I had to try to put myself back on track
[29:45.240 --> 29:47.240]  But no disrespect to that edible company
[29:47.240 --> 29:49.240]  I was not supposed to eat all of it at once
[29:49.240 --> 29:51.240]  No, I listened to that episode
[29:51.240 --> 29:53.240]  I was high
[29:53.240 --> 29:55.240]  You weren't, yeah, not at all
[29:55.240 --> 29:57.240]  You weren't even supposed to eat half of that at once
[29:57.240 --> 29:59.240]  No
[29:59.240 --> 30:01.240]  Why do they make this stuff so good though?
[30:01.240 --> 30:03.240]  It was delicious too
[30:03.240 --> 30:05.240]  If that was just a restaurant dinner
[30:05.240 --> 30:07.240]  Or a restaurant dessert, I'd order that
[30:07.240 --> 30:09.240]  I'd eat that peanut butter thing you serve
[30:09.240 --> 30:11.240]  Put some ice cream with it, it'd be delicious
[30:11.240 --> 30:13.240]  So since we're going into flower
[30:13.240 --> 30:15.240]  We're starting to stretch a little bit
[30:15.240 --> 30:17.240]  We're looking for the males, we're looking for hermaphrodites
[30:17.240 --> 30:19.240]  Also, if it's questionable, if it's weird
[30:19.240 --> 30:21.240]  Keep a really good eye on it
[30:21.240 --> 30:23.240]  Lower inner branches
[30:23.240 --> 30:25.240]  That's a good spot to look for hermies
[30:25.240 --> 30:27.240]  Where you don't get as much light
[30:27.240 --> 30:29.240]  Straight on the top too
[30:29.240 --> 30:31.240]  Top lead buds, that's a common area too
[30:31.240 --> 30:33.240]  Get those out of there
[30:33.240 --> 30:35.240]  The males and the herms, get them out of there
[30:35.240 --> 30:37.240]  Put them in the fire pit
[30:37.240 --> 30:39.240]  Be careful when you're throwing away your trash
[30:39.240 --> 30:41.240]  If you live in a non-legal state
[30:41.240 --> 30:43.240]  That's something I just want to throw out there for you
[30:43.240 --> 30:45.240]  Just compost it
[30:45.240 --> 30:47.240]  Or feed it to your chickens
[30:47.240 --> 30:49.240]  Come on, Jesse, not all of us have a farm
[30:49.240 --> 30:51.240]  Some of us are city folk here
[30:51.240 --> 30:53.240]  There's another podcast
[30:53.240 --> 30:55.240]  Where one of the guys has chickens
[30:55.240 --> 30:57.240]  Oh yeah, I shout those guys out
[30:57.240 --> 30:59.240]  So we can say that
[30:59.240 --> 31:01.240]  Yeah, Word, what's up homie?
[31:01.240 --> 31:03.240]  What up bro? He cooked me dinner one time
[31:03.240 --> 31:05.240]  Indirectly, I was at an event or at a party
[31:05.240 --> 31:07.240]  Where he was the chef and he made dinner for everybody
[31:07.240 --> 31:09.240]  Props man, good cooking
[31:09.240 --> 31:11.240]  He actually asked me about my dietary needs
[31:11.240 --> 31:13.240]  Because he saw that I got dreadlocks, he knew I was a Rasta
[31:13.240 --> 31:15.240]  Oh that's awesome
[31:15.240 --> 31:17.240]  Rastas have strict dietary restrictions and he was respectful to that
[31:17.240 --> 31:19.240]  Made a meal around what I can and cannot eat
[31:19.240 --> 31:21.240]  I always do that when I barbecue with vegetarian friends
[31:21.240 --> 31:23.240]  You don't know that yet
[31:23.240 --> 31:25.240]  Well you invited me and you assured me
[31:25.240 --> 31:27.240]  That there would be vegetarian friendly food
[31:27.240 --> 31:29.240]  I appreciate that
[31:29.240 --> 31:31.240]  So guys, respect your vegetarian friends
[31:31.240 --> 31:33.240]  Don't make fun of them, that's just stupid
[31:33.240 --> 31:35.240]  Yeah
[31:35.240 --> 31:37.240]  Why do you eaters make fun of us?
[31:37.240 --> 31:39.240]  That is so stupid
[31:39.240 --> 31:41.240]  We make fun of you back when you do it
[31:41.240 --> 31:43.240]  Because your colon is full of fucking rotten meat
[31:43.240 --> 31:45.240]  And you're telling me I'm stupid for not eating it
[31:47.240 --> 31:49.240]  We get even in our own ways
[31:49.240 --> 31:51.240]  And then you guys die
[31:51.240 --> 31:53.240]  Hey, hey, hey
[31:53.240 --> 31:55.240]  I don't even know any good vegetarian jokes
[31:55.240 --> 31:57.240]  Neither do I
[31:57.240 --> 31:59.240]  What do you call a vegetarian with diarrhea?
[31:59.240 --> 32:01.240]  Oh yeah, that's a classic one
[32:01.240 --> 32:03.240]  That's the only one I got for you
[32:03.240 --> 32:05.240]  Vegetarian, let's feed our ganja plants
[32:05.240 --> 32:07.240]  We're going into bloom
[32:07.240 --> 32:09.240]  So we can slowly decrease the nitrogen
[32:09.240 --> 32:11.240]  And increase the phosphorus and potassium
[32:11.240 --> 32:13.240]  If you're top dressing
[32:13.240 --> 32:15.240]  You can switch your teas to the more phosphorus and potassium based teas
[32:15.240 --> 32:17.240]  For sure
[32:17.240 --> 32:19.240]  If you're using the granulated products
[32:19.240 --> 32:21.240]  You can switch to the more
[32:21.240 --> 32:23.240]  You can switch to the bloom
[32:23.240 --> 32:25.240]  You don't have to keep using the veg stuff
[32:25.240 --> 32:27.240]  Yeah
[32:27.240 --> 32:29.240]  Slowly switch to that stuff
[32:29.240 --> 32:31.240]  Still
[32:31.240 --> 32:33.240]  Well
[32:33.240 --> 32:35.240]  Assuming you've only applied it one or two times
[32:35.240 --> 32:37.240]  Something like that
[32:37.240 --> 32:39.240]  Make sure you have nitrogen
[32:39.240 --> 32:41.240]  Because a lot of times
[32:41.240 --> 32:43.240]  Those products are pretty low on nitrogen
[32:43.240 --> 32:45.240]  On the bloom side
[32:45.240 --> 32:47.240]  Well actually when I feed my insects
[32:47.240 --> 32:49.240]  I feed them a lot of nitrogen
[32:49.240 --> 32:51.240]  So maybe
[32:51.240 --> 32:53.240]  Well actually when I feed my indoor plants
[32:53.240 --> 32:55.240]  I don't switch
[32:55.240 --> 32:57.240]  The day that I put them into flower
[32:57.240 --> 32:59.240]  I don't just say they're in flower
[32:59.240 --> 33:01.240]  Let's cut out all the veg newts
[33:01.240 --> 33:03.240]  And go to just my bloom schedule
[33:03.240 --> 33:05.240]  I kind of phase it out
[33:05.240 --> 33:07.240]  There's like a two week period
[33:07.240 --> 33:09.240]  And I also keep my metal halide lights in
[33:09.240 --> 33:11.240]  For about 14 to 21 days
[33:11.240 --> 33:13.240]  To keep them short and stocky
[33:13.240 --> 33:15.240]  And then when you switch them
[33:15.240 --> 33:17.240]  You really see them stay low
[33:17.240 --> 33:19.240]  What's your favorite spray to say?
[33:19.240 --> 33:21.240]  Um
[33:21.240 --> 33:23.240]  Yeah start out with that Mexican bat guano
[33:23.240 --> 33:25.240]  Um
[33:25.240 --> 33:27.240]  Epsom salts if you're using that
[33:27.240 --> 33:29.240]  Um
[33:29.240 --> 33:31.240]  It's a good time to be foliar
[33:31.240 --> 33:33.240]  You know one last foliar spray
[33:33.240 --> 33:35.240]  Mexican or Jamaican bat guano
[33:35.240 --> 33:37.240]  Jamaican
[33:37.240 --> 33:39.240]  There you go
[33:39.240 --> 33:41.240]  I just want to correct you
[33:41.240 --> 33:43.240]  I think you said
[33:43.240 --> 33:45.240]  A high PK
[33:45.240 --> 33:47.240]  Any alfalfa meal with this feed?
[33:47.240 --> 33:49.240]  Um I love that stuff
[33:49.240 --> 33:51.240]  So
[33:51.240 --> 33:53.240]  Um yeah I mean
[33:53.240 --> 33:55.240]  It's a great time to go ahead and top dress some in
[33:55.240 --> 33:57.240]  Um
[33:57.240 --> 33:59.240]  Alfalfa meal
[33:59.240 --> 34:01.240]  You know it's really accessible nitrogen
[34:01.240 --> 34:03.240]  So
[34:03.240 --> 34:05.240]  What else are you putting in your tea right now?
[34:05.240 --> 34:07.240]  Some Jamaican guano?
[34:07.240 --> 34:09.240]  Yeah
[34:09.240 --> 34:11.240]  Some alfalfa meal?
[34:11.240 --> 34:13.240]  Yep
[34:13.240 --> 34:15.240]  Or a warm
[34:15.240 --> 34:17.240]  Uh
[34:17.240 --> 34:19.240]  Factory
[34:19.240 --> 34:21.240]  Some warm poop
[34:21.240 --> 34:23.240]  Yeah
[34:23.240 --> 34:25.240]  He's got the bomb stuff
[34:25.240 --> 34:27.240]  I can't uh
[34:27.240 --> 34:29.240]  I'm kind of stoned
[34:29.240 --> 34:31.240]  Rocky mountain
[34:31.240 --> 34:33.240]  I don't remember the name of it either
[34:33.240 --> 34:35.240]  I think it's what it is
[34:35.240 --> 34:37.240]  If you google Rocky Mountain worms
[34:37.240 --> 34:39.240]  You'll find what we're talking about
[34:39.240 --> 34:41.240]  I've had my own
[34:41.240 --> 34:43.240]  That's a free shout out too
[34:43.240 --> 34:45.240]  Yeah we do a lot of free shout outs
[34:45.240 --> 34:47.240]  For sure it's good stuff though
[34:47.240 --> 34:49.240]  It's community
[34:49.240 --> 34:51.240]  It's not all about business all the time
[34:51.240 --> 34:53.240]  Um
[34:53.240 --> 34:55.240]  Some Mico's
[34:55.240 --> 34:57.240]  There's several different brands of it
[34:57.240 --> 34:59.240]  OGT
[34:59.240 --> 35:01.240]  Great White Shark
[35:01.240 --> 35:03.240]  ZHO
[35:03.240 --> 35:05.240]  The ORCA stuff
[35:05.240 --> 35:07.240]  Liquid
[35:07.240 --> 35:09.240]  That's half dead
[35:09.240 --> 35:16.600]  Yeah, I always fear that liquids are gonna wreak havoc on the rest of my stuff. Yeah, because you don't know what preservative there is
[35:16.680 --> 35:19.960]  Yeah, yeah, and the powders you can sprinkle it right near the root zone and yeah
[35:20.360 --> 35:23.640]  And see that it's on there and be happy with that. Yeah. Yeah
[35:24.680 --> 35:27.720]  The ogt is available at hygro puebla for sure. That stuff's awesome
[35:27.800 --> 35:29.800]  That's what I would recommend out of all that you can
[35:30.360 --> 35:36.360]  I can see a difference when I feed my plants that within 24 hours, uh, the next light cycle two light cycles later
[35:36.360 --> 35:42.120]  I guess when they come on they are praying they're up. Yeah, the leaves are pointing straight up like yes, make them pray
[35:42.360 --> 35:47.080]  Yeah, they they love that. That should be their slogan. Yeah. No, that's uh, ogt's the bomb
[35:47.400 --> 35:51.880]  Uh, great white shark is really good at getting rid of soil-based insects
[35:52.520 --> 35:55.080]  Nice. Oh, yeah. Yeah, something in there. It doesn't like yeah
[35:57.080 --> 36:00.600]  Uh, i've heard the grokashi does same thing too, so we're
[36:01.320 --> 36:03.000]  Doing some experiments with that right now
[36:03.080 --> 36:09.020]  So yeah, jesse mentioned before we recorded that he got some grokashi if you guys aren't paying attention to the grokashi it's probiotics
[36:09.720 --> 36:16.120]  Uh big love to the probiotic farmers alliance. What up gauge green and all the guys running the probiotic farmers alliance gauge green
[36:16.120 --> 36:21.160]  Yeah, yeah about that. Yeah, it's key play and uh, I don't know if I should use mike's real name, but what's up mike?
[36:23.240 --> 36:24.840]  Those guys are inspiring
[36:24.840 --> 36:29.640]  People ask where I get a lot of my inspiration and a lot of my ideas and shit. Uh, a lot of it
[36:30.120 --> 36:32.600]  Currently comes from gauge that's who i'm on now
[36:32.920 --> 36:37.560]  Nice when there was a time where it was all soma, of course. Yeah. Yeah, I didn't know soma
[36:37.560 --> 36:41.480]  I had no idea what that was and then a friend of mine was like you remind me of soma and I googled it and
[36:41.480 --> 36:43.480]  I was like it could be my father's shit
[36:44.600 --> 36:50.700]  Uh, then there was some racist say whoever told you that. Yeah, it kind of is you're both white and have dreadlocks
[36:52.040 --> 36:57.480]  It was all about the vibe. It was more about the vibe soma talks about memetics and i'm really big on the memetics
[36:57.800 --> 37:00.120]  We'll talk about more about that later. That's the it's like a
[37:00.840 --> 37:05.240]  The vibes sub cool always gets me going sub. I was into sub cool for a little while. Uh,
[37:05.880 --> 37:09.960]  Not to be a hater. I lost interest when it got dramatic with him and miss jill on the weed nerd show
[37:10.040 --> 37:12.360]  That's when I fell off. Sorry. That's where I lost interest
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.400]  Uh, and then uh, i've always been a big fan of jorge and ed rosenthal for sure all that stuff
[37:17.480 --> 37:20.200]  But I like reading that's always gets me fired up. Yeah
[37:20.440 --> 37:25.240]  Yeah, lately gauge green has been one of the best reader. I was I was a cali connection fan boy for a little while
[37:25.240 --> 37:30.280]  I'm pretty decent friends with swerve and adam ill so for sure. Yeah, he's got it going on. Yeah, dude
[37:30.440 --> 37:32.440]  That's that's a good seed company right there
[37:32.920 --> 37:34.440]  You work hard you get paid good
[37:34.440 --> 37:40.360]  They were kind enough to let us hang out in their booth for 420 at the cannabis cup on 420 at 420
[37:40.440 --> 37:45.880]  So everyone else is crowded and chaotic and I was sitting on a couch taking a dab with adam ill so
[37:46.200 --> 37:52.040]  Any I was at the cannabis cup anyone who had a couch anywhere was chilling. Yeah. Yeah
[37:52.840 --> 37:54.840]  That was a hot cup
[37:55.000 --> 38:00.040]  Yeah, can't wait for 420 again this year. I hear big things are coming. I thought two years ago was crowded but
[38:01.320 --> 38:06.440]  It was more chaotic two years ago for sure though. Oh that year when you couldn't walk through. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[38:07.000 --> 38:08.440]  It was the alley
[38:08.440 --> 38:13.160]  That alley was ridiculous big shout out. Uh, the high times crew. Danny danko. Bobby black nico
[38:13.320 --> 38:16.280]  I'm gonna miss a lot because there's a lot of you guys. Mr. Dan sky
[38:18.120 --> 38:20.440]  Shout out to you guys for coming to colorado and doing a huge ass event
[38:20.440 --> 38:21.320]  That's a lot of work
[38:21.320 --> 38:25.000]  You guys look like you're going fucking crazy when you come here and do it running around all chaotic
[38:25.640 --> 38:30.280]  For sure. Yeah, and danny danko will take time to talk to you. I walked by him just kindly I said free weed
[38:30.840 --> 38:33.800]  Joking around the same thing and he turned around and shook my hand and talked to me
[38:33.880 --> 38:36.600]  And that was kind of neat. He didn't need to do that. He was busy, you know
[38:36.680 --> 38:41.880]  Yeah, I interrupted him right in the middle of a conversation. I was like, hey, thanks for recording free weed, dude
[38:42.600 --> 38:46.360]  Danny you haven't put out a podcast in over a month. Yeah, what's up episode of free weed?
[38:46.440 --> 38:50.520]  I'm trying to fill your gap dude. I'm trying to fill your gap for you. That's gross. I'm never gonna say that to you
[38:52.120 --> 38:54.120]  Uh
[38:54.360 --> 38:56.360]  Feeling danny danko's gap
[38:57.240 --> 39:00.920]  There's a podcast called free weed. It's uh hosted by danny danko and my queues
[39:01.320 --> 39:04.520]  Uh, it's a high times production. I'm not sponsored by them in any way
[39:04.520 --> 39:10.120]  I just have respect for people, uh, danny danko and the free weed podcast are actually part of what inspired this show for sure
[39:10.920 --> 39:12.440]  I like to do things my way
[39:12.440 --> 39:17.640]  And I kind of combined a lot of my favorite people's shows and do my own thing here and we have the agro culture podcast
[39:18.040 --> 39:21.240]  What's up my queues too, yeah how I mentioned I made sure to say my
[39:21.960 --> 39:25.640]  Just making sure. Yeah, make sure he gets love. I always feel bad for the uh
[39:26.440 --> 39:32.760]  Um for mike. Yeah, he contributes heavily should be free weed with uh, danny and mike. They're mr. Danny
[39:33.960 --> 39:37.480]  You hear that guys just kidding. Just kidding. We'll tag at danny danko in this episode
[39:39.480 --> 39:42.440]  I'm not sure if I follow my queues, but we'll tag him also
[39:43.240 --> 39:46.760]  We'll see if they can listen to this and uh, you better hook me up with something like
[39:48.360 --> 39:50.360]  a
[39:50.760 --> 39:51.880]  Raw papers
[39:51.880 --> 39:56.680]  Hey, that'll work. His name is jesse grows. So if you want to give a shout out, it's rasta jeff and jesse grows
[39:57.560 --> 40:02.760]  For sure, I said your uh full name on the other podcast. Uh, sorry, it's gotten to the point. I don't really give a shit
[40:02.840 --> 40:07.560]  Yeah, uh, I tried to keep my identity kind of separate from the irie genetics irie grow culture stuff
[40:07.640 --> 40:09.960]  But everybody knows it's rasta. Yeah, you can't
[40:10.760 --> 40:15.160]  After the first cannabis cup people took pictures with me and they're like look i'm getting high with irie genetics
[40:15.160 --> 40:20.600]  And I was like, well, they know i'm the fucking yeah ridiculously tall white guy with red locks. This is game over
[40:20.920 --> 40:27.320]  I remember when we first met you uh told me something about that and then within like a few weeks you're like, whatever
[40:28.920 --> 40:30.920]  Try to keep it on the down low man. Yeah
[40:32.200 --> 40:36.520]  After the cup when I went and sub cool is there with packs of seeds in his hand like what's up?
[40:36.520 --> 40:41.800]  I'm sub cool. Here's seeds. I was like, I don't have shit to worry about like yeah. Yeah, he doesn't even live in this state and
[40:42.520 --> 40:48.200]  It's just yeah changed my whole outlook on things for sure. All right guys, we've talked a little bit about outdoor growing
[40:48.280 --> 40:52.280]  We're starting to bloom. I told you how to find your males your hermaphrodites get those out of there
[40:52.760 --> 40:54.760]  We told you to cut clones make sure you cut clones
[40:54.840 --> 40:58.680]  You don't want to grow some shit and then be like this is my best strain ever and it's gone
[40:59.240 --> 41:02.520]  I've done that. I actually grew a strain. I don't know if I even want to say the name kevin
[41:02.600 --> 41:06.280]  If you're listening, it was that uh that strain that you and pops loved it's gone
[41:06.760 --> 41:11.000]  I couldn't get it to root those clones would not take roots for the life of me. So i've had that happen
[41:11.000 --> 41:13.720]  It got away. I've got another pack of those seeds. We'll see if that works
[41:14.200 --> 41:17.800]  Uh, you got to stop topping but you can super crop and train your stuff
[41:18.360 --> 41:23.720]  We were talking about what jesse puts in I try to uh, he doesn't realize i'm trying to fish out what he's putting in his tea
[41:23.800 --> 41:27.560]  Because he doesn't like to tell us he doesn't like to share all the info. So I slowly pry it out of him
[41:27.960 --> 41:32.840]  We got molasses. We got alfalfa meal. We got guano. We got worm castings. We got micos
[41:32.920 --> 41:37.960]  Are you using any sort of sea kelp right now? Yeah kelp. Yeah, uh, the doctor neptune stuff
[41:38.360 --> 41:40.360]  uh, see details for like a
[41:41.960 --> 41:43.960]  A couple cups. Um
[41:44.600 --> 41:50.280]  Yeah, and now it's flower time. So, uh blood meal bone meal any of that stuff yet
[41:50.680 --> 41:55.960]  I've never put any of that stuff. Oh, you don't like slaughterhouse products. Well, no, I use it. I've never put it in a tea
[41:56.280 --> 42:01.560]  Okay, um, but top dressing. Yeah. Okay. I do have an issue with slaughterhouse products, but I also have a
[42:02.440 --> 42:08.440]  A shit ton of slaughterhouse products. So you're a farmer and you understand. Yeah. Yeah, you uh, you balance it out
[42:08.680 --> 42:11.160]  Yeah, I mean there's nothing wrong with blood meals just like
[42:12.040 --> 42:16.520]  Where I well, I mean, I guess the argument could be made that there is something wrong with it
[42:16.520 --> 42:20.040]  But the biggest thing with commercial blood meals, we don't know where it came from
[42:20.280 --> 42:25.240]  um, you know those or at least that's my big issue with it and those cows were fed shit that
[42:25.880 --> 42:28.280]  I probably highly disapprove of so yeah
[42:28.600 --> 42:32.920]  Um and don't want to put into my body part of why i'm a vegetarian is because the way they treat cows
[42:33.080 --> 42:36.520]  Yeah, yeah, for sure. There's no need to contribute to that in my opinion in general
[42:36.600 --> 42:43.960]  I don't really like eating beef. Um, I can't stand ground beef. It's one of the most disgusting things I can that's the most questionable meat
[42:45.320 --> 42:49.720]  Ground up what I hate when i'm working and in a hurry and yeah
[42:50.440 --> 42:56.520]  As a farmer and a grower are you bothered by like fast food joints by seeing what people are eating? Yeah
[42:56.760 --> 43:01.880]  um process any kind of processed meat, um, and i'm just as guilty of it, um,
[43:02.920 --> 43:05.080]  I I try hard when I get busy in life
[43:05.160 --> 43:11.000]  um, you know, it's just it's hard to cook and it's easy to drive through drive through and uh, but yeah, that's
[43:11.400 --> 43:14.440]  That's why this country's so fat. That's why we have cancer. That's
[43:15.060 --> 43:16.760]  Everything it's just
[43:16.760 --> 43:17.800]  Yeah
[43:17.800 --> 43:20.200]  I agree. I have a huge issue with all that stuff
[43:20.520 --> 43:24.520]  Yeah, we paid people will pay top dollar for their booze pay top dollar for their herb
[43:24.680 --> 43:30.360]  But then spend 99 cents on a fucking cheeseburger. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah spend those bucks on yourself guys. Yeah
[43:30.920 --> 43:37.560]  Cancer is expensive later in your life. Just cook at home. It's good for relationships cook with friends eat with friends eat with
[43:37.800 --> 43:40.680]  you know your wife your girlfriend your kids, it's just
[43:41.560 --> 43:43.160]  you know
[43:43.160 --> 43:44.520]  It's just good
[43:44.520 --> 43:50.760]  Cook with friends for relationships. That's some sound advice from jesse. You learned some shit on accident today. You didn't think that was coming
[43:52.520 --> 43:54.040]  All right, uh, we've done 30 minutes man
[43:54.040 --> 43:57.080]  You got anything else you want to add to the grow lesson before we kind of start wrapping it up?
[43:57.800 --> 43:59.560]  um
[43:59.560 --> 44:05.560]  a little d vegging, um, go ahead pull up the bottoms of the plants, uh, so clip off any uh,
[44:05.960 --> 44:10.280]  Shave their legs shave their legs. Let's make them sexy all that bottom stuff is going to be
[44:11.000 --> 44:13.880]  Crap and larf and it's going to kind of take away from the top of your plant
[44:13.880 --> 44:18.520]  So take that bottom the little sucker leaves you can tell what i'm talking about if it's not making and you can do this
[44:19.000 --> 44:23.160]  All the way up to like three or four weeks into bloom if you want to keep doing it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[44:23.160 --> 44:26.040]  Just take off all that crap. Yeah is in the way
[44:26.120 --> 44:29.400]  You'll know if it doesn't look like it's going to be a bud worth trimming take it off
[44:29.480 --> 44:31.880]  It doesn't need to be there and throw it away. Don't just throw it on the ground
[44:31.880 --> 44:34.840]  I see a lot of you guys cut your leaves off throw them in the ground. Don't do that
[44:35.480 --> 44:37.480]  Reuse it in some way. Uh, yeah
[44:38.520 --> 44:45.100]  I've been oh mulching. That's what we'll throw up real quick. Um, i've been mulching up a little bit, uh little alfalfa
[44:46.280 --> 44:47.560]  um
[44:47.560 --> 44:53.720]  Some old hay that we had laying around. Um, actually I think it was straw but um, whatever
[44:54.440 --> 44:57.080]  All the city folk. Oh, yeah, that's the same shit
[44:57.960 --> 45:00.040]  um some compost, um
[45:01.160 --> 45:09.240]  And uh, you know just helps hold water. Um, it's getting into the hot time of year and normally, uh, we're monsoon season right now apparently
[45:10.920 --> 45:14.840]  Um, you know this other people in other parts of the country, you know, this
[45:15.400 --> 45:21.720]  Mulching up is good. And it's also a great way to get rid of all your green waste. So, um, you know, that's it
[45:22.200 --> 45:24.200]  It's just a big old cycle
[45:24.600 --> 45:29.400]  If you're if you're juicing, uh, you could juice your cannabis leaves if you haven't been spraying shit on them
[45:29.400 --> 45:31.880]  If you've put neem oil or some chemicals do not juice them
[45:31.960 --> 45:37.640]  Please don't if you're uh, if your leaves are clean, uh, go ahead and juice those and taste that up. Yeah, so we're
[45:38.200 --> 45:40.200]  Mulching now you have taught us a lot of stuff
[45:40.520 --> 45:45.160]  Everyone's gonna move to the country and abandon the city and all move out to the middle of nowhere and just start these organic
[45:45.240 --> 45:49.800]  Small not even large scale just small scale organic ganja farms. Yeah, you don't have to do much
[45:49.960 --> 45:55.480]  I mean just do your part grow your own food grow your own herb get some chickens make your own eggs, you know
[45:55.480 --> 45:56.600]  I don't eat fertilizer
[45:56.600 --> 46:01.080]  Uh, I really try not to eat eggs if you like it's just not that just seems funky to me
[46:01.240 --> 46:05.960]  I can't eat but grocery store eggs if uh, yeah, if I it's kind of where i'm headed if I had chickens, bro
[46:06.040 --> 46:11.480]  We'd eat eggs every day. I'd go out and get two or three eggs from the chickens and we'd do it like the uh
[46:11.720 --> 46:13.720]  Your shirt you were in there. Uh
[46:13.800 --> 46:18.760]  You know that yellow is like grocery store yellow and their orange is like what my eggs look like
[46:19.000 --> 46:24.280]  Wow, you know, that's probably 10 times the nutrients in there. Yeah, and also the flavor they have a flavor. Yeah
[46:24.600 --> 46:29.960]  Um, you you just think eggs have flavor too till you have good ones. So you have a good farm fresh egg
[46:30.440 --> 46:32.840]  And I I have my chickens in the city too. So
[46:33.560 --> 46:38.360]  You know, we have them at the farm too, but I also have chickens in my backyard. So you can have chickens over there
[46:38.520 --> 46:42.360]  Yeah, that's cool. Yeah, that's cool. I didn't know you could do that. Can I have a in pueblo?
[46:42.440 --> 46:45.720]  You can have don't quote me on this but I think it's six or seven
[46:46.360 --> 46:47.560]  um
[46:47.560 --> 46:49.560]  No encroachment. Um
[46:49.560 --> 46:53.480]  Which means, you know, you can't build it right next to your chicken pen right next to your fence
[46:54.200 --> 46:56.760]  Um, it's got to be five feet from a property line
[46:57.400 --> 46:58.280]  um
[46:58.280 --> 47:02.680]  No roosters. So yeah, and and they can't be a nuisance which you know
[47:03.480 --> 47:05.480]  Takes a while to develop a nuisance. So
[47:06.600 --> 47:10.840]  I have one that i'm about ready to kill. I can't believe none of my neighbors have called him
[47:12.440 --> 47:14.440]  It wakes me up too early i'm like
