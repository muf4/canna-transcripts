[00:02.240 --> 00:20.860]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[00:20.860 --> 00:25.100]  It's time for episode number 161 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[00:25.100 --> 00:26.580]  news, education, and conversation.
[00:26.580 --> 00:27.580]  That's right.
[00:27.580 --> 00:31.980]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
[00:31.980 --> 00:36.020]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current
[00:36.020 --> 00:40.260]  state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:40.260 --> 00:42.100]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:42.100 --> 00:44.120]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:44.120 --> 00:47.320]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots
[00:47.320 --> 00:50.320]  band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:50.320 --> 00:55.320]  Big shout out to Kat, Koot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:55.320 --> 00:56.320]  Happy Halloween everybody.
[00:56.320 --> 00:57.480]  I think this episode comes out on Halloween.
[00:57.480 --> 00:58.880]  I hope you're all dressed up.
[00:58.880 --> 01:00.280]  I hope you're having a fun time.
[01:00.280 --> 01:01.600]  I hope you got a cool ass costume.
[01:01.600 --> 01:04.240]  Send me a picture of yourself in your Halloween costume.
[01:04.240 --> 01:05.240]  I want to see what you wore.
[01:05.240 --> 01:06.720]  I want to see what you look like.
[01:06.720 --> 01:11.440]  Speaking of Halloween costumes, I want to give a huge shout out to my friends at Elevate.
[01:11.440 --> 01:15.720]  I went to the Heddy Halloween party sponsored by our friends at Elevate Glass.
[01:15.720 --> 01:16.720]  It was at, where was it?
[01:16.720 --> 01:18.280]  It was at the Black Sheep in Colorado Springs.
[01:18.280 --> 01:19.280]  Sorry, I had to turn that music down.
[01:19.280 --> 01:20.280]  I could not even focus.
[01:20.280 --> 01:22.520]  That was really loud in my brains.
[01:22.520 --> 01:24.400]  Heddy Halloween, that was a great party.
[01:24.400 --> 01:26.800]  Big shout out to Becca, big shout out to Elevate.
[01:26.800 --> 01:30.680]  Heddy Halloween was the Halloween party thrown by our friends at Elevate Glass.
[01:30.680 --> 01:33.320]  They threw the party at the Black Sheep.
[01:33.320 --> 01:36.040]  There was a DJ, there were a couple few bands.
[01:36.040 --> 01:37.040]  There was a bunch of people.
[01:37.040 --> 01:38.040]  They had booths there.
[01:38.040 --> 01:40.440]  They had live glass blowing.
[01:40.440 --> 01:41.440]  It was a really good time.
[01:41.440 --> 01:45.400]  They had a costume contest and guess what you guys, I won first place in a costume contest.
[01:45.400 --> 01:46.400]  That's right.
[01:46.400 --> 01:49.680]  I've got a Chewbacca costume that is super dope.
[01:49.680 --> 01:51.360]  I bought it at a costume shop.
[01:51.360 --> 01:52.920]  It took them a long time to get it in stock.
[01:52.920 --> 01:55.120]  It took like three weeks to order that thing.
[01:55.120 --> 01:56.720]  It was kind of pricey.
[01:56.720 --> 02:00.320]  It wasn't the cheapest costume anybody's ever bought, but it was well worth it because I've
[02:00.320 --> 02:04.520]  had it for, I think I've had it for four or five years and I wear it every other year
[02:04.520 --> 02:07.120]  and every year I win at least one costume contest in it.
[02:07.120 --> 02:09.240]  So it is paid for itself.
[02:09.280 --> 02:13.480]  At the Elevate Party, I won a dope new rig.
[02:13.480 --> 02:16.000]  It's a Halloween themed rig.
[02:16.000 --> 02:17.040]  It's orange.
[02:17.040 --> 02:20.080]  It's a brighter orange than normal orange, but it's like orange, a little brighter than
[02:20.080 --> 02:22.160]  orange crayon.
[02:22.160 --> 02:23.480]  It's got a pumpkin on the back of it.
[02:23.480 --> 02:25.080]  It's just a straight tube.
[02:25.080 --> 02:28.880]  It's about, I don't know, it's probably, it's almost the same.
[02:28.880 --> 02:33.080]  It's the same height as my Dr. Pepper bottle, almost the height of a water bottle.
[02:33.080 --> 02:34.080]  So it's a straight tube.
[02:34.080 --> 02:38.000]  It's got a round ball pumpkin looking base and then it's got a straight tube and then
[02:38.000 --> 02:42.720]  another orange, kind of a pumpkin looking spot and then a straight piece and then another
[02:42.720 --> 02:45.680]  pumpkin looking orange bulb with a green top on it.
[02:45.680 --> 02:46.680]  So it looks pumpkin-y.
[02:46.680 --> 02:49.160]  It takes a 14 millimeter banger.
[02:49.160 --> 02:53.240]  So I got a 14 millimeter banger on it that came from Elevate and I've also got a carb
[02:53.240 --> 02:54.600]  cap on here that came from Elevate.
[02:54.600 --> 02:55.920]  So shout out to my friends at Elevate.
[02:55.920 --> 02:59.800]  You guys, I know it sounds like a fix that I won the costume contest, but guess what?
[02:59.800 --> 03:02.080]  The people from Elevate did not decide that I won.
[03:02.080 --> 03:05.440]  The crowd decided that I won the costume contest, so it could not be a fix.
[03:05.440 --> 03:09.520]  It was based on crowd applause and it was clear that they liked my costume.
[03:09.520 --> 03:12.640]  So big shout out to everybody that was at the costume contest that voted for me.
[03:12.640 --> 03:14.780]  I appreciate that.
[03:14.780 --> 03:17.080]  Big congratulations to Becca.
[03:17.080 --> 03:18.440]  She was a little nervous about her party.
[03:18.440 --> 03:19.800]  She was messaging me throughout the week.
[03:19.800 --> 03:20.800]  She's like, are you coming?
[03:20.800 --> 03:22.440]  I hope it's a good turnout.
[03:22.440 --> 03:27.800]  And then by the middle of the night, we realized that she sold that place out.
[03:27.800 --> 03:29.600]  So that was pretty rad.
[03:29.600 --> 03:30.780]  Congratulations on selling the place out.
[03:30.780 --> 03:32.960]  Big shout out to Matt Z who made the rig.
[03:32.960 --> 03:33.960]  Also I got to mention that.
[03:34.480 --> 03:36.880]  We're going to wrap up the shout outs here and get to the topic of the show in just a
[03:36.880 --> 03:37.880]  second.
[03:37.880 --> 03:39.440]  I'm going to give a huge shout out again to Becca.
[03:39.440 --> 03:42.040]  Huge shout out to Dabbing Granny for hanging out with me at the event.
[03:42.040 --> 03:43.600]  I had a lot of fun with Dabbing Granny.
[03:43.600 --> 03:48.520]  I was taking pictures and I'm always the tallest guy in the damn party.
[03:48.520 --> 03:51.760]  And I was wearing that Chewbacca costume, which makes me another, I'm 6'5 already, you
[03:51.760 --> 03:52.760]  guys, honestly.
[03:52.760 --> 03:57.920]  I'm probably 7'2 in the Chewbacca costume because the mask is real, real tall.
[03:57.920 --> 04:00.560]  So it makes me a little taller.
[04:00.560 --> 04:04.560]  We were taking pictures and Granny's a tall lady, but we were taking some pictures and
[04:04.560 --> 04:07.960]  she was right in front of me and she had to bend over to do a pose or something.
[04:07.960 --> 04:11.120]  She did something and then they told me to squat down because I'm too tall and they couldn't
[04:11.120 --> 04:12.120]  get my head in the picture.
[04:12.120 --> 04:15.640]  So Granny and I were kind of kind of hanging out a little close there and she made some
[04:15.640 --> 04:16.640]  jokes about it.
[04:16.640 --> 04:17.640]  It was really funny.
[04:17.640 --> 04:18.640]  Granny is such a hilarious lady.
[04:18.640 --> 04:20.280]  It's really funny hanging out with her.
[04:20.280 --> 04:22.680]  You guys, no matter how old you are, she can fucking keep up with you.
[04:22.680 --> 04:24.640]  She can smoke more dope than you.
[04:24.640 --> 04:25.640]  Granny's a rad lady.
[04:25.640 --> 04:26.640]  So big shout out to Dabbing Granny.
[04:26.640 --> 04:28.280]  Her Halloween costume was awesome.
[04:28.280 --> 04:30.360]  She was a cannabis nun.
[04:30.360 --> 04:31.960]  I stuttered when I said that.
[04:31.960 --> 04:32.960]  Excuse me.
[04:32.960 --> 04:35.160]  She was a cannabis nun.
[04:35.160 --> 04:36.160]  That's what I meant to say.
[04:36.160 --> 04:37.160]  Cannabis nun.
[04:37.160 --> 04:42.680]  Yeah, she wore a nun outfit that had ganja leaves hanging off of it and she had cool
[04:42.680 --> 04:44.220]  ganja sunglasses.
[04:44.220 --> 04:47.080]  She changed her sunglasses three or four times throughout the night, I think, or I might
[04:47.080 --> 04:48.080]  have been real high.
[04:48.080 --> 04:51.240]  Honestly, it was hard to see shit through that Chewbacca costume.
[04:51.240 --> 04:52.240]  So shout out to Granny.
[04:52.240 --> 04:55.720]  Shout out to Lindsay and Chris, Bobo Blaster Co.
[04:55.720 --> 04:58.080]  They were, aw shit, the citrus drop chick.
[04:58.080 --> 04:59.080]  I think that's what it's called.
[05:00.080 --> 05:04.600]  You guys know that soda commercial with the awkward ginger girl and she wears the drop,
[05:04.600 --> 05:06.480]  the shirt, the tank top with her soda on it.
[05:06.480 --> 05:09.320]  It's a lemon lime soda and some short shorts.
[05:09.320 --> 05:10.400]  They were both that.
[05:10.400 --> 05:12.200]  So it was kind of, it was silly cute.
[05:12.200 --> 05:13.200]  Shout out to Foxy.
[05:13.200 --> 05:15.760]  He hung out with me a little bit at the Halloween party.
[05:15.760 --> 05:18.320]  His costume, he looked like a, it was hard to tell.
[05:18.320 --> 05:23.800]  He had horns and yeah, it looked like a Viking sort of thing.
[05:23.800 --> 05:25.360]  Also Logan and Cody hung out.
[05:25.360 --> 05:26.560]  I saw Lydia.
[05:26.560 --> 05:28.160]  Abigail looked adorable.
[05:28.240 --> 05:29.240]  Mackenzie looked adorable.
[05:29.240 --> 05:30.600]  You guys, I'm just going to rattle on a bunch of names.
[05:30.600 --> 05:34.240]  A big shout out to everyone at freaking the Hedy Halloween party.
[05:34.240 --> 05:35.240]  That was awesome.
[05:35.240 --> 05:36.240]  I had a great time.
[05:36.240 --> 05:37.240]  Thanks for having me.
[05:37.240 --> 05:38.840]  I hope we do that again next year.
[05:38.840 --> 05:39.840]  All right.
[05:39.840 --> 05:43.160]  I want to get into the main topic of the show.
[05:43.160 --> 05:47.440]  There's one more thing I have to talk about before I get into the main topic.
[05:47.440 --> 05:48.600]  Excuse me for all the throat clearing.
[05:48.600 --> 05:49.600]  I just noticed something.
[05:49.600 --> 05:52.080]  I put a new mic cover on this microphone, you guys.
[05:52.080 --> 05:56.560]  I tried to replace the microphone covers on these mics so that not everybody's spitting
[05:56.560 --> 05:59.240]  into the same thing and rubbing their face on the same shit for a long time.
[05:59.240 --> 06:02.920]  And I just gave myself a fresh new one and it, it stinks.
[06:02.920 --> 06:05.960]  It smells like, like shoe polish or something funky.
[06:05.960 --> 06:06.960]  That's pretty terrible.
[06:06.960 --> 06:08.680]  But for some reason I keep sniffing it.
[06:08.680 --> 06:11.240]  I'm not exactly sure why.
[06:11.240 --> 06:13.600]  So yeah, let's, what do I have to do next?
[06:13.600 --> 06:16.560]  I have to give a shout out to my friends at the dank team.com.
[06:16.560 --> 06:19.280]  You guys, a lot of people have been asking me, of course I am.
[06:19.280 --> 06:20.280]  I read genetics.
[06:20.280 --> 06:22.900]  I breed, I bred the grateful dog, the lemon Jeffrey.
[06:22.900 --> 06:27.020]  Right now I'm pretty much known for the arise is what's been going on this real popular.
[06:27.020 --> 06:28.460]  I just made a rise have twos.

[06:29.940 --> 06:30.940]  Anyway, I am.
[06:30.940 --> 06:35.620]  I read genetics and a lot of people know that and they ask me for seeds.
[06:35.620 --> 06:40.260]  If you were local in Colorado and you can find me, maybe we can do that, but I cannot
[06:40.260 --> 06:45.800]  ship seeds to anybody, but my friends at the dank team, they can ship you seeds.

[07:58.020 --> 08:03.180]  All right, guys, let's get into the main topic of this podcast.
[08:03.180 --> 08:05.580]  The main thing I want to talk about, I was on a forum the other day.
[08:05.580 --> 08:06.700]  Yes, I do read the forums.
[08:06.700 --> 08:07.700]  I troll around.
[08:07.700 --> 08:10.140]  I do not use the name that anybody would recognize me by.
[08:10.140 --> 08:11.340]  So you won't find me on there.
[08:11.340 --> 08:16.020]  I'm also in a bunch of Facebook groups, but I've, uh, I've had to check out of a bunch
[08:16.020 --> 08:21.380]  of the Facebook groups because honestly I see so, I apologize for all the throat clearing.
[08:21.380 --> 08:23.500]  You guys, I was taking some fat dabs with some live residents.
[08:23.500 --> 08:25.380]  It's just got me all clogged up, but we'll deal with it.
[08:25.380 --> 08:26.380]  We'll get through a podcast.
[08:26.380 --> 08:28.300]  It'll quit right about the time the show ends.
[08:28.300 --> 08:30.500]  I see a bunch of bullshit and Facebook groups.
[08:30.500 --> 08:34.620]  You guys, I see people recommending the shittiest advice and then I go look at the person that
[08:34.620 --> 08:35.620]  gave that advice.
[08:35.620 --> 08:38.660]  I look at their pictures of their grow and I can see why their girl looks the way it
[08:38.660 --> 08:41.540]  does and why they're giving the advice that they are giving.
[08:41.540 --> 08:44.740]  They're not qualified and it kind of frustrates me.
[08:44.740 --> 08:46.100]  So I had to leave a bunch of Facebook groups.
[08:46.100 --> 08:47.460]  I'm not in a lot of them.
[08:47.460 --> 08:51.020]  Um, I, but I do go troll around and browse around the forums.
[08:51.020 --> 08:52.580]  So I see what's going on.
[08:52.580 --> 08:56.600]  And lately a topic I've seen more than once or twice is people were talking about ways
[08:56.600 --> 09:01.420]  to determine flowering times of new seeds and new clones that they've gotten that they
[09:01.420 --> 09:03.460]  don't have any information on.
[09:03.460 --> 09:07.500]  Maybe somebody got some bag seed and they don't know how long to let that bag seed flower,
[09:07.500 --> 09:10.960]  or maybe somebody was gifted a clone and they don't know anything about the clone from the
[09:10.960 --> 09:12.380]  friend that gave it to them.
[09:12.380 --> 09:16.900]  So they were like, Hey Ross to Jeff, how do I determine how long to let these plants
[09:16.900 --> 09:18.940]  flower so that I don't fuck up my crop?
[09:18.940 --> 09:21.420]  So you guys, I'm going to get some water here and fix up my throat.
[09:21.420 --> 09:23.900]  You know, I'm going to take a couple more dabs and then after that we're going to talk
[09:23.900 --> 09:26.620]  about how to determine flowering time of new cultivars.
[09:26.620 --> 09:28.620]  Let me clear my throat.
[09:28.620 --> 09:31.060]  All right, you guys, I am back.
[09:31.060 --> 09:35.220]  I promised we would talk about ways to determine flowering time of new cultivars.
[09:35.220 --> 09:39.020]  So maybe you got some seeds and you don't know how long those seeds are supposed to
[09:39.020 --> 09:40.020]  take.
[09:40.340 --> 09:43.560]  Maybe you had a bunch of packs of seeds and these got mixed up or mislabeled or weren't
[09:43.560 --> 09:45.580]  labeled at all, or maybe they came out of a bag.
[09:45.580 --> 09:48.180]  Maybe you've got seeds that you're running and you have no idea what they are.
[09:48.180 --> 09:51.460]  You're going to need to know how long to let those plants flower.
[09:51.460 --> 09:52.840]  Maybe your buddy gave you clones.
[09:52.840 --> 09:54.660]  Maybe you bought clones at the dispensary.
[09:54.660 --> 09:57.380]  Maybe you cut clones and you don't know which clone that is.
[09:57.380 --> 10:01.060]  You need to determine how long to let that plant flower.
[10:01.060 --> 10:06.000]  So obviously the way to, the easiest way to do that would to be flower that plant out
[10:06.000 --> 10:08.980]  and then around week seven or eight, maybe eight or nine.
[10:09.540 --> 10:14.060]  I would say about week seven, get in there and start looking at that plant with a loop
[10:14.060 --> 10:18.460]  or a magnifier of some sort of a magnifying glass, some sort of an eye.
[10:18.460 --> 10:23.340]  You need at least a 60 to 100 times magnifying glass to look at these plants.
[10:23.340 --> 10:28.260]  You want to see the trichomes that are on your buds and look in a few different places
[10:28.260 --> 10:29.260]  on the plant.
[10:29.260 --> 10:30.420]  Don't just look in one spot.
[10:30.420 --> 10:32.740]  So what I use hooks up to my computer.
[10:32.740 --> 10:35.900]  I've got a, let me see, I can go right here on my computer.
[10:35.900 --> 10:37.060]  It'll remind me the brand.
[10:37.060 --> 10:38.060]  It's from Dynoscope.
[10:38.140 --> 10:41.620]  I've got a Dynoscope, a little, it's a scope that hooks up.
[10:41.620 --> 10:43.020]  It's a magnifying scope that hooks up.
[10:43.020 --> 10:45.020]  It's a USB port goes right into my computer.
[10:45.020 --> 10:46.300]  It works with a Mac.
[10:46.300 --> 10:47.460]  It works with a windows machine.
[10:47.460 --> 10:48.460]  I use it on a Mac.
[10:48.460 --> 10:49.460]  So I promise it works.
[10:49.460 --> 10:52.500]  It was a bitch to get it started, but once I downloaded the driver and got it working,
[10:52.500 --> 10:53.500]  it works beautifully.
[10:53.500 --> 10:57.420]  Every time now I can take screenshots of what I'm seeing.
[10:57.420 --> 11:02.100]  But this little scope, I basically, I can take, I take my chair because it rolls and
[11:02.100 --> 11:05.860]  has wheels and I put the Mac book on the chair because I'm clumsy and I like to drop shit.
[11:05.860 --> 11:09.980]  So I leave the Mac book on the chair and I roll it around and then I use the scope.
[11:09.980 --> 11:14.220]  It's got a nice long cord and then I use that scope to go find the spots that I want on
[11:14.220 --> 11:15.220]  the plant.
[11:15.220 --> 11:19.020]  And then I look at the screen and I can see if the trichomes are Amber or if the trichomes
[11:19.020 --> 11:24.540]  are clear or if they're milky or if they're busted, ruptured open and got shit dripping
[11:24.540 --> 11:25.540]  out of them.
[11:25.540 --> 11:27.740]  I can see that clearly with the scope I've got.
[11:27.740 --> 11:28.980]  I can see bug shit.
[11:28.980 --> 11:34.060]  If there is bug shit in my plants, I can see any insect in the world with this scope that
[11:34.060 --> 11:35.060]  I've got.
[11:35.260 --> 11:37.940]  I can pull a leaf off randomly and look at the underside of the leaf and see what's going
[11:37.940 --> 11:38.940]  on.
[11:38.940 --> 11:42.740]  Look for eggs, looks for bugs, look for bug shit, look for signs of bugs.
[11:42.740 --> 11:48.580]  So what you need, if you can't get that type of a thing for your computer, uh, they sell
[11:48.580 --> 11:50.140]  the four 20 scope is okay.
[11:50.140 --> 11:52.580]  I think they call it the dope scope or the four 20 scope.
[11:52.580 --> 11:53.580]  That's okay.
[11:53.580 --> 11:57.920]  There's one sold at the growth store, uh, that is made by Hydra farm, which is the one
[11:57.920 --> 11:58.920]  that I like.
[11:58.920 --> 12:00.320]  I have the a hundred X little scope.
[12:00.320 --> 12:01.740]  It takes a double a battery at full.
[12:01.740 --> 12:05.300]  It may take two batteries, but it folds, uh, folds together real nicely.
[12:05.300 --> 12:08.460]  And when you unfold it, it lights up and then you can see through it real well.
[12:08.460 --> 12:12.900]  Uh, that one I really like, but get yourself a scope so that you can look at the trichomes
[12:12.900 --> 12:15.980]  at least 60 X a hundred X magnification is better.
[12:15.980 --> 12:18.940]  Uh, it's the most obvious way to tell when plants are done.
[12:18.940 --> 12:23.340]  Uh, when within your view, you're probably going to see a certain amount of trichomes.
[12:23.340 --> 12:28.820]  It's going to be hard to count them, but you want about 25 to 30% of those 20 to 30% of
[12:28.820 --> 12:29.820]  those.
[12:29.820 --> 12:30.820]  You want them turning Amber.
[12:30.900 --> 12:34.100]  So you want it to kind of look like the color, like maybe you dipped them in Dr. Pepper,
[12:34.100 --> 12:36.700]  or maybe they got a little, they're just, you could see it.
[12:36.700 --> 12:39.420]  It turns the Amber orange-ish color.
[12:39.420 --> 12:44.660]  They'll start off clear, then they'll get Milky and then they get like a silvery color.
[12:44.660 --> 12:47.060]  And then from silver, that's when they start turning Amber.
[12:47.060 --> 12:51.020]  And when 30% of your trichomes are Amber, that's usually when you want to harvest most
[12:51.020 --> 12:52.060]  strains.
[12:52.060 --> 12:54.020]  So it's kind of up to you.
[12:54.020 --> 12:55.920]  You can go a little early, you can go a little late.
[12:55.920 --> 12:57.460]  It's not that huge of a deal.
[12:57.460 --> 13:00.820]  A lot of people way overstress the harvest window.
[13:00.820 --> 13:05.540]  In a production facility, we say the strain gets this many days and then we're cutting
[13:05.540 --> 13:08.660]  it the fuck down because we have another crop coming up right behind it.
[13:08.660 --> 13:13.340]  So, and the weed comes out pretty fabulous in most of the production facilities.
[13:13.340 --> 13:17.060]  And we just pick something like 60 days or 70 days.
[13:17.060 --> 13:20.260]  I like to say 63 days, because that's nine full weeks of flower.
[13:20.260 --> 13:23.620]  And most of the strains we're running nowadays, nine weeks is perfect.
[13:24.260 --> 13:30.060]  Let's talk a little more because this scope, looking at the trichomes is really going to
[13:30.060 --> 13:34.700]  help you out, but you're going to need to know a little earlier in the game when to
[13:34.700 --> 13:39.780]  harvest because you're going to need to flush your plants about 10 to 14 days before you
[13:39.780 --> 13:41.020]  start cutting down.
[13:41.020 --> 13:43.340]  I heavily stress flushing your plants.
[13:43.340 --> 13:45.940]  It's free and you've got to water the plants anyway.
[13:45.940 --> 13:51.220]  So why not just pour a bunch of water in there and clean the plants out?
[13:51.220 --> 13:56.740]  So let's talk about some ways to determine how long those plants are going to take.
[13:56.740 --> 14:00.420]  You need to figure out how Indica or sativa dominant those plants are.
[14:00.420 --> 14:04.520]  And a huge indicator of that is leaf shape and size.
[14:04.520 --> 14:10.220]  If your leaf has really long slender fingers, it's probably sativa dominant and you're going
[14:10.220 --> 14:15.100]  to lead more toward the nine to 10 week range, maybe even longer.
[14:15.100 --> 14:20.980]  If your plants have big, fat, broad leaves, if they're real wide, if the wider the leaf
[14:21.740 --> 14:24.460]  probably the shorter the flowering period is something that I've learned.
[14:24.460 --> 14:27.740]  That's not always true, but it's usually a good thing to follow.
[14:27.740 --> 14:32.080]  So if you've got good wide leaves, you're looking at eight to nine weeks.
[14:32.080 --> 14:37.420]  Now if you've got a eight or nine week plant, the first time you run it, I recommend going
[14:37.420 --> 14:38.420]  nine weeks.
[14:38.420 --> 14:40.560]  Why not try that extra week to see what happens?
[14:40.560 --> 14:42.260]  You may get more bulk right at the end.
[14:42.260 --> 14:44.540]  You may get more resin right at the end.
[14:44.540 --> 14:46.020]  It may harden up.
[14:46.020 --> 14:48.140]  It may do a lot of good shit in that last one week.
[14:48.140 --> 14:49.140]  So let that happen.
[14:49.140 --> 14:52.980]  It's not going to overripen too much, but don't worry about a little overripening.
[14:52.980 --> 14:55.460]  It's not that huge of a game, especially if it's your first time.
[14:55.460 --> 14:59.340]  That's something I wrote down that I wanted to wait a little while to mention, but this
[14:59.340 --> 15:02.780]  is hopefully not your last time running this strain.
[15:02.780 --> 15:06.620]  This is your first time running this strain, which means you can fuck it up because you
[15:06.620 --> 15:10.340]  have another time and another time and another time after that to run it.
[15:10.340 --> 15:13.900]  Hopefully if this is a good genetic, a good cultivar, and you can keep it around, you're
[15:13.900 --> 15:15.780]  going to be running it a bunch of times.
[15:15.780 --> 15:16.900]  So this is just your test run.
[15:16.900 --> 15:17.900]  This is your first date.
[15:17.900 --> 15:19.120]  You'll be okay.
[15:19.120 --> 15:25.400]  So leaf size and leaf shape will give you a big hint on how long those plants are going
[15:25.400 --> 15:26.400]  to take.
[15:26.400 --> 15:29.000]  If you've got an eight or nine week plant, like I just said, like the eight or nine week
[15:29.000 --> 15:32.160]  Indica, let it go nine weeks because you want it to go to full maturity.
[15:32.160 --> 15:35.320]  If you've got a plant with long skinny leaves, that's a nine to 10 week plant.
[15:35.320 --> 15:38.000]  I would recommend letting that plant go 10 weeks the first time.
[15:38.000 --> 15:39.000]  Why not?
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.080]  You want to see what the potential of that plant is.
[15:41.080 --> 15:44.960]  A lot of those sativa plants really do magical shit toward the end of their growth phase
[15:44.960 --> 15:46.800]  or at the end of their flowering phase.
[15:46.800 --> 15:48.600]  They bulk up, they resin up.
[15:48.600 --> 15:50.040]  They really put on some flavor.
[15:50.040 --> 15:51.520]  They get better at the end.
[15:51.520 --> 15:54.720]  They're probably swelling up because they want to be bred to and you're not giving them
[15:54.720 --> 15:55.720]  any pollen.
[15:55.720 --> 15:58.320]  So they're just getting bigger and bigger and stickier and fatter.
[15:58.320 --> 16:01.160]  So sometimes it's better to let those sativa strains go longer.
[16:01.160 --> 16:02.780]  I like an 11 week sativa.
[16:02.780 --> 16:06.880]  It doesn't scare me to run a 77 day sativa dominant plant.
[16:06.880 --> 16:08.320]  Flower it when it's real short.
[16:08.320 --> 16:12.160]  Be ready to have some sticks and supports available and get that sucker going.
[16:12.160 --> 16:16.040]  Don't be afraid to grow something that takes 77 days or even maybe a little bit longer.
[16:16.040 --> 16:17.040]  It's well worth it.
[16:17.040 --> 16:18.040]  You're going to get more potency.
[16:18.480 --> 16:22.240]  You're going to get more weight and everybody loves that good sativa buzz and it's harder
[16:22.240 --> 16:23.240]  to find.
[16:23.240 --> 16:25.040]  Everyone's growing those shorter indicas.
[16:25.040 --> 16:28.200]  So if you're growing a heady sativa, you're going to stand out from the crowd.
[16:28.200 --> 16:29.480]  Medical users are going to appreciate it.
[16:29.480 --> 16:30.480]  They're going to want more.
[16:30.480 --> 16:32.120]  Recreational users are going to love it.
[16:32.120 --> 16:33.120]  They're going to want more.
[16:33.120 --> 16:34.900]  So that's going to help everybody out.
[16:34.900 --> 16:39.580]  So the basic leaf size is a good indicator of how long your strain may take from the
[16:39.580 --> 16:40.580]  very beginning.
[16:40.580 --> 16:42.240]  If it's real broad, you're looking at eight to nine weeks.
[16:42.240 --> 16:46.980]  If you've got some skinny leaves, go nine or 10 weeks, maybe even a little bit longer.
[16:46.980 --> 16:50.820]  The thing is, if you start flushing a little bit too early, that's okay.
[16:50.820 --> 16:53.980]  If you start flushing too late, that's when you start overdoing things.
[16:53.980 --> 16:54.980]  You'll be okay.
[16:54.980 --> 16:58.300]  So if you've got these plants that are going to end up taking 13 or 14 weeks and you've
[16:58.300 --> 17:02.340]  already started flushing to be prepared for week 11, you'll be okay.
[17:02.340 --> 17:03.900]  They're just going to start looking a little ragged.
[17:03.900 --> 17:07.140]  They're going to turn a little bit yellow, but they'll keep going.
[17:07.140 --> 17:10.820]  If you're growing a really long sativa, something that I should mention, if you're a new grower
[17:10.820 --> 17:15.980]  and you're growing a long sativa longer than 11 weeks, you will be lucky if by the end
[17:15.980 --> 17:18.980]  of that grow, that plant has any big leaves left.
[17:18.980 --> 17:22.540]  Those plants like to, they're finicky and they will lose a lot of leaves.
[17:22.540 --> 17:26.540]  They'll look like shit, but you'll have amazing medicine still because they're hardy and a
[17:26.540 --> 17:29.260]  plant that goes that long is meant to survive.
[17:29.260 --> 17:33.560]  A lot of experienced growers have a hard time with a longer flowering plant because the
[17:33.560 --> 17:35.740]  feeding regimen is kind of confusing.
[17:35.740 --> 17:39.860]  You're not sure when to phase certain nutrients out and when to phase certain nutrients in
[17:39.860 --> 17:43.820]  because everything happens at a different time than what we're all taught about these
[17:43.820 --> 17:44.820]  nine week plants.
[17:44.820 --> 17:48.180]  So everybody, all the nutrient companies that sell you stuff, most of the stuff you see
[17:48.180 --> 17:52.020]  online when they're recommending feeding, they're basing that on about an eight to nine
[17:52.020 --> 17:53.860]  week flowering phase.
[17:53.860 --> 17:55.860]  Most of them don't even give you enough time to flush.
[17:55.860 --> 17:59.060]  Most tell you to flush for one week because they want you to keep pumping fucking product
[17:59.060 --> 18:00.620]  into your plants.
[18:00.620 --> 18:03.420]  So my point to all this is that you can't really over flush.
[18:03.420 --> 18:05.580]  So be prepared to flush, flush like normal.
[18:05.580 --> 18:09.660]  Then if the plants look like they want longer, let them go longer.
[18:09.660 --> 18:11.780]  You can tell if they want to go longer by using the scope.
[18:11.780 --> 18:14.260]  That's pretty much the only way you can get in there and tell.
[18:14.700 --> 18:18.660]  Also, something that will give you a hint of how long the plants are going to take is
[18:18.660 --> 18:23.220]  the basic structure, my words are hard to say today, I apologize.
[18:23.220 --> 18:28.500]  The basic structure of your plants, how tall they get, how quickly, how much they branch
[18:28.500 --> 18:30.700]  out, how bushy the plant is.
[18:30.700 --> 18:32.160]  Is it growing straight up?
[18:32.160 --> 18:35.900]  If that plant's going straight up and not making a lot of side branches, you've probably
[18:35.900 --> 18:39.980]  got yourself a sativa dominant plant that's going to take a little longer to flower.
[18:39.980 --> 18:41.620]  It's just going to keep going straight up.
[18:41.620 --> 18:46.260]  If you've got a plant that is growing really long, lanky branches, and it's just going
[18:46.260 --> 18:49.740]  really, really fast, that plant may take a little longer to flower.
[18:49.740 --> 18:53.980]  If your plant is staying short and stocky and real squatty and just getting wider and
[18:53.980 --> 18:58.620]  wider as it grows, you've probably got an indica dominant plant, which is also, you're
[18:58.620 --> 19:03.260]  going to have to put that trait together with your leaf size and kind of put those two together
[19:03.260 --> 19:06.940]  and let those two things kind of give you hints of how much indica and how much sativa
[19:06.940 --> 19:09.820]  are in those plants and how long you should let them go.
[19:09.820 --> 19:13.060]  If you've got seeds and the breeder pack says that they're done in eight to nine weeks,
[19:13.060 --> 19:15.580]  I recommend you let them go nine weeks.
[19:15.580 --> 19:17.820]  Maybe even let them go a little bit longer if you can.
[19:17.820 --> 19:18.820]  I like to let stuff go.
[19:18.820 --> 19:19.820]  I'm kind of weird.
[19:19.820 --> 19:23.900]  I like things to go nine, 10 or 11 weeks just because it's easier to remember.
[19:23.900 --> 19:27.820]  I know a lot of strains that I run, 63 days is perfect for most of them.
[19:27.820 --> 19:28.820]  All right, you guys.
[19:28.820 --> 19:34.420]  So that is basically ways to figure out flowering times of new seeds and new clones that you've
[19:34.420 --> 19:35.420]  got.
[19:35.420 --> 19:37.660]  Check the trichomes if you've got a scope.
[19:37.660 --> 19:42.660]  If you can hook your scope up to your computer, I recommend you check in three places.
[19:42.660 --> 19:46.020]  Check at the top of the plant, that big top bud, check that one.
[19:46.020 --> 19:47.400]  Check in the middle of the plant.
[19:47.400 --> 19:51.180]  So you know how you got the top and if you didn't do any topping, you got a top and then
[19:51.180 --> 19:53.140]  there's buds that come up right underneath that.
[19:53.140 --> 19:57.060]  The next part of the crown, the next part of the bouquet, check some of those.
[19:57.060 --> 20:00.620]  Check like right around that ring there and then go down a little bit further in the plant
[20:00.620 --> 20:03.440]  and check down there and see how the difference is going.
[20:03.440 --> 20:05.280]  You may be really amber down at the bottom.
[20:05.280 --> 20:07.380]  You may be really clear at the top.
[20:08.100 --> 20:12.660]  I like to harvest when about 30% of the total trichomes have started to show amber.
[20:12.660 --> 20:15.780]  So it kind of looks like you got a little bit of Dr. Pepper on them or a little bit
[20:15.780 --> 20:19.080]  of root beer or something and they're just starting to turn a little bit brownish.
[20:19.080 --> 20:21.500]  If you wait too long, they all start turning that color.
[20:21.500 --> 20:23.980]  I feel like they kind of, the plants lose their flavor.
[20:23.980 --> 20:26.500]  You can cut them a little bit earlier and they're going to taste better.
[20:26.500 --> 20:27.500]  Here's part of the deal.
[20:27.500 --> 20:29.060]  You cut them sooner, they taste better.
[20:29.060 --> 20:32.360]  You cut them a little bit later, they probably get heavier and more potent.
[20:32.360 --> 20:35.760]  So that's something you want to balance on yourself.
[20:35.760 --> 20:39.360]  Most people are focused on getting as much as they can from each light or each square
[20:39.360 --> 20:43.420]  foot or each square meter or each table, however you're growing nowadays and however you're
[20:43.420 --> 20:45.620]  doing the measurement for your own business plan.
[20:45.620 --> 20:50.040]  So most people want to let it go that extra few days and add on that extra bulk.
[20:50.040 --> 20:53.240]  And I mean, they just get more potent in my opinion as you let them go.
[20:53.240 --> 20:58.320]  So guys, that's mostly ways to kind of predetermine how long to let your plants flower.
[20:58.320 --> 21:01.560]  All right, you guys, I wrote down a couple of more notes that I want to talk about that
[21:01.560 --> 21:04.820]  I was inspired to rant on because of this topic.
[21:04.880 --> 21:06.580]  But before I get that far, I need a dab.
[21:06.580 --> 21:07.580]  I don't need a dab.
[21:07.580 --> 21:09.120]  It makes me sound weird when I say that I need a dab.
[21:09.120 --> 21:10.120]  I felt weird.
[21:10.120 --> 21:11.940]  I would love to take a dab with you guys.
[21:11.940 --> 21:16.380]  So if you were in a safe place where you can smoke, start getting a dab ready.
[21:16.380 --> 21:22.660]  I'm taking the lid off of some golden goat shatter from TR Concentrate.
[21:22.660 --> 21:24.420]  This golden goat shatter is amazing.
[21:24.420 --> 21:27.220]  There's very little left because I really like it.
[21:27.220 --> 21:31.820]  I keep coming up to the table where the e-mail is and I'm like, I'm going to take a little
[21:31.820 --> 21:32.820]  dab of that golden goat.
[21:32.820 --> 21:36.620]  And I just get a little dab of it and I take a dab and I get the flavor on my mouth.
[21:36.620 --> 21:39.300]  But I take just such a little dab that it doesn't really get me high because I take
[21:39.300 --> 21:40.300]  a lot of dabs.
[21:40.300 --> 21:41.300]  You guys, I take a lot of big dabs.
[21:41.300 --> 21:42.980]  So I'd be like, shit, I'm going to take another little dab.
[21:42.980 --> 21:43.980]  I'll take another little dab.
[21:43.980 --> 21:45.980]  And after like two or three of those, I'll be like, you know what, fuck it.
[21:45.980 --> 21:49.020]  I'm just gonna take a big dab and I'll take a big dab that I should have just started
[21:49.020 --> 21:50.820]  with and then I end up really high.
[21:50.820 --> 21:51.820]  It's funny.
[21:51.820 --> 21:52.820]  I like it.
[21:52.820 --> 21:55.780]  So this gram of golden goat shatter has not lasted very long at all.
[21:55.780 --> 21:59.340]  Good job to whoever grew the material and then a really good job to our friends at
[21:59.340 --> 22:01.580]  TR Concentrates.
[22:01.580 --> 22:02.580]  This came out wonderfully.
[22:02.580 --> 22:04.700]  It is just straight shatter.
[22:04.700 --> 22:07.420]  I talk about different consistencies of hash.
[22:07.420 --> 22:11.420]  This is like a little pane of glass wrapped in parchment.
[22:11.420 --> 22:13.860]  It's not that sharp because it's more like Jolly Ranchers.
[22:13.860 --> 22:17.780]  It's like if you had a sheet of Jolly Rancher, it would just be snappy like this.
[22:17.780 --> 22:19.700]  I'm trying to fold it back up so that I can put this away.
[22:19.700 --> 22:20.700]  All right.
[22:20.700 --> 22:22.420]  I've got the hash onto the dabber.
[22:22.420 --> 22:28.100]  I've got the hash put away, putting it back in my childproof, child safe container.
[22:28.100 --> 22:29.860]  I just like keeping it in that container because it's labeled.
[22:30.140 --> 22:32.140]  I got a couple of the flavors over here.
[22:32.140 --> 22:33.140]  All right.
[22:33.140 --> 22:34.140]  So we got me a dab.
[22:34.140 --> 22:36.580]  I'm going to heat up the nail.
[22:36.580 --> 22:40.140]  Right now I'm smoking on a quartz banger.
[22:40.140 --> 22:41.540]  So let's talk about some different nails.
[22:41.540 --> 22:43.300]  A lot of times you see me using the e-nail.
[22:43.300 --> 22:45.220]  If you've ever watched me on Instagram, it's a nail.
[22:45.220 --> 22:48.420]  It's made out of titanium and it's got a cord attached to it and actually attaches to a
[22:48.420 --> 22:53.300]  box and that box keeps the nail at the appropriate temperature for taking dabs all the time.
[22:53.300 --> 22:54.540]  I'm not using that right now.
[22:54.540 --> 22:55.540]  It is right here next to me.
[22:55.540 --> 22:56.540]  It's turned on.
[22:56.700 --> 23:00.100]  I want to use this rig that I won.
[23:00.100 --> 23:02.300]  So I've got a quartz banger.
[23:02.300 --> 23:05.220]  It kind of looks like a normal bowl, like a pipe bowl.
[23:05.220 --> 23:07.820]  So it's basically just a little dish.
[23:07.820 --> 23:10.020]  It's a quartz dish.
[23:10.020 --> 23:11.020]  It's pinky deep.
[23:11.020 --> 23:12.260]  It looks like a thimble.
[23:12.260 --> 23:16.420]  It's almost like a thimble, you guys, but it's quartz.
[23:16.420 --> 23:17.420]  So it's quartz.
[23:17.420 --> 23:20.380]  Of course, it's got a little piece that goes into the rig and it goes into the rig just
[23:20.380 --> 23:22.140]  kind of like where a bong bowl would go.
[23:22.140 --> 23:24.900]  And then of course I'm using the rig I won from Elevate.
[23:24.900 --> 23:26.860]  It's a pumpkin looking rig.
[23:26.860 --> 23:29.220]  So with a little pumpkin on the back, which is the coolest part.
[23:29.220 --> 23:30.940]  So I'm gonna hit the banger.
[23:30.940 --> 23:33.060]  It's gonna be hard to hear me probably while I do that.
[23:33.060 --> 23:37.260]  I got a lot of compression going on here, but I don't think it'll cut this out.
[23:37.260 --> 23:41.300]  But while I heat it, make sure you check out the dank team.com.
[23:41.300 --> 23:43.620]  They've got a fresh drop of iRegenetics in stock.
[23:43.620 --> 23:47.460]  So make sure you check them out for feminized and regular cannabis seeds needs.
[23:47.460 --> 23:50.540]  All right, you guys, here in just a couple of seconds, I'm going to take a dab of this
[23:50.540 --> 23:52.660]  golden goat and then we will get on with this podcast.
[23:52.660 --> 23:54.460]  I do appreciate you dabbing with me.
[23:54.460 --> 23:56.300]  I hope you're heating the nail right now.
[23:56.300 --> 23:58.220]  My nail has got to cool because I just way overheated it.
[23:58.220 --> 24:00.100]  It's kind of cleaning off some funk.
[24:00.100 --> 24:01.100]  So let the nail cool.
[24:01.100 --> 24:03.780]  All right, you guys, let's dab together.
[24:03.780 --> 24:07.240]  Here we go.
[24:07.240 --> 24:08.240]  Feels cool now.
[24:08.240 --> 24:26.060]  Let's do this.
[24:26.060 --> 24:28.580]  That was a pretty big dab.
[24:28.580 --> 24:32.140]  Maybe bigger than I needed for a podcast, but what could go wrong, right?
[24:32.140 --> 24:35.180]  I just got to sit here and talk into a microphone.
[24:35.180 --> 24:37.380]  Ooh, yeah.
[24:37.380 --> 24:38.580]  Yes.
[24:38.580 --> 24:40.260]  Excellent work to my friends at TR Concentrates.
[24:40.260 --> 24:43.820]  This golden goat shatter is amaze balls.
[24:43.820 --> 24:44.820]  I approve.
[24:44.820 --> 24:47.860]  All right, my head will quit spinning here in just a couple of seconds and we're going
[24:47.860 --> 24:49.420]  to move on with the parts that I wrote down.
[24:49.420 --> 24:52.100]  I'm glad I wrote them down because I would have forgotten by now.
[24:52.100 --> 24:54.620]  I'm going to take one last drink here and then we'll get on with this.
[24:54.620 --> 24:57.100]  Guys, I hope you took a fat dab with me.
[24:57.100 --> 24:59.940]  If you're dabbing with me while you're listening to the show, send me a tweet.
[24:59.940 --> 25:01.580]  Let me know what you're smoking on.
[25:01.580 --> 25:06.060]  Tweet me at GFYH podcast on Twitter, at GFYH podcast.
[25:06.060 --> 25:09.260]  I'd love to know that you're smoking with me and I'd love to know what you're smoking
[25:09.260 --> 25:10.260]  on.
[25:10.260 --> 25:13.500]  All right, so let's get to the notes that I wrote down.
[25:13.500 --> 25:19.140]  I wrote down that phenotype variations will take different times to flower, which means
[25:19.140 --> 25:24.220]  if you buy a package of seeds, not every seed in that package is going to take the same
[25:24.220 --> 25:26.180]  amount of time to flower.
[25:26.180 --> 25:31.180]  You may get one strain that takes or one phenotype that takes nine weeks and you may get one
[25:31.180 --> 25:35.740]  phenotype that takes 10 weeks to flower out of the same package.
[25:35.740 --> 25:38.720]  Now the reason for that, I'll explain a little bit why.
[25:39.560 --> 25:46.600]  When I talk about F1 and F2 breeding and F3 and F4, when you make an F1, it's got a very
[25:46.600 --> 25:48.200]  wide variety of traits.
[25:48.200 --> 25:53.520]  It'll bring out traits from the mother plant and the father plant that were used, the female
[25:53.520 --> 25:54.520]  and the male.
[25:54.520 --> 25:58.020]  So the girl plant that received the pollen and the male plant that threw pollen, those
[25:58.020 --> 26:01.780]  traits are going to show, but also the grandparents.
[26:01.780 --> 26:06.840]  So whatever female you used, the male and female used for that are going to show up
[26:06.840 --> 26:08.240]  in your F1s.
[26:08.240 --> 26:13.000]  And whatever you used for the male, the male and female used to make that is going to show
[26:13.000 --> 26:14.400]  up in your F1 seeds.
[26:14.400 --> 26:18.960]  So you're going to see grandma, you're going to see grandpa, and then you're also going
[26:18.960 --> 26:21.440]  to see grandma and grandpa on the other side.
[26:21.440 --> 26:24.160]  And then you're also going to see mommy and you're also going to see daddy.
[26:24.160 --> 26:28.320]  So you're going to have a lot of different phenotypes popping up from some F1s.
[26:28.320 --> 26:29.840]  This is a possibility.
[26:29.840 --> 26:33.120]  So you may get one that takes eight weeks.
[26:33.120 --> 26:36.320]  You may get one that takes 10 weeks and this is very possible.
[26:36.400 --> 26:39.840]  So when you make those F1s, there's a lot of variation.
[26:39.840 --> 26:46.340]  So what we do as breeders, we find the most desirable female that you can find out of
[26:46.340 --> 26:48.240]  all of your seeds, out of the F1s.
[26:48.240 --> 26:52.040]  You want the one that is whatever you're looking for, the best stink or the best growth or
[26:52.040 --> 26:53.040]  the best resin.
[26:53.040 --> 26:54.940]  You want the best all around girl.
[26:54.940 --> 26:58.680]  And then you want to take pollen from the male from the same generation and throw that
[26:58.680 --> 27:00.760]  pollen onto that girl.
[27:00.760 --> 27:03.360]  And the seeds that come from there will be called F2.
[27:03.800 --> 27:08.320]  F2s will be a little bit more stabilized, meaning you're not going to see as much representation
[27:08.320 --> 27:12.280]  of the grandparents pop up in the seeds, but you're going to see a little bit closer to
[27:12.280 --> 27:16.720]  the mommy and daddy and you're going to start narrowing it down a little bit more closely
[27:16.720 --> 27:20.680]  to what you're trying to make with that seed line.
[27:20.680 --> 27:25.480]  Something interesting that happens with an F2 cross is called transgressive segregation.
[27:25.480 --> 27:32.560]  You actually see the kids outperform the parents is generally what happens.
[27:33.560 --> 27:34.880]  It'll also go the other way also.
[27:34.880 --> 27:39.240]  You'll see weaker traits also, but we call those as breeders, hopefully.
[27:39.240 --> 27:45.960]  So you'll see if you put a gigantic male and a gigantic female and the male makes super
[27:45.960 --> 27:51.060]  stink and the female makes super resin, you put them together, you just may make the super
[27:51.060 --> 27:55.680]  Hulk on your F2s because you're going to see that transgressive segregation come through
[27:55.680 --> 27:59.080]  mostly in the F2 generation is where I find that.
[27:59.080 --> 28:02.180]  So then I would find my favorite F2, right?
[28:02.180 --> 28:05.860]  The best looking girl of that F2 that's got the traits I'm going after.
[28:05.860 --> 28:08.020]  Hopefully it was very similar to the F1s.
[28:08.020 --> 28:09.020]  You know what I mean?
[28:09.020 --> 28:11.460]  You found the one that looked like you were going after and then you go find another one
[28:11.460 --> 28:14.340]  that looks like that, that's an F2 or that's improved.
[28:14.340 --> 28:16.340]  And then you hit it with the pollen from the F2 male.
[28:16.340 --> 28:21.460]  Now you have to find a male and a female and then you hit the female with the male pollen.
[28:21.460 --> 28:24.220]  And when those seeds come out, you've now made F3.
[28:24.220 --> 28:28.860]  Now what I'm getting at is every time you do that, if you do it correctly, sometimes
[28:28.860 --> 28:29.860]  you have to go back.
[28:30.060 --> 28:32.900]  You got to keep a bag of seeds from the old ones that go back and re-hunt.
[28:32.900 --> 28:37.340]  But if you do it correctly, when you go through each time, you're going to make that strain
[28:37.340 --> 28:39.020]  more stable and more stable.
[28:39.020 --> 28:42.660]  So you'll start off with like five different phenotypes and you breed it again.
[28:42.660 --> 28:46.940]  And now hopefully you just worked it down to like three solid phenotypes and then you
[28:46.940 --> 28:48.220]  breed it again.
[28:48.220 --> 28:52.740]  And then you got two solid phenotypes to where when you grow these plants, you're 50-50 going
[28:52.740 --> 28:54.340]  to get this one or this one.
[28:54.340 --> 28:55.340]  You know what I mean?
[28:55.340 --> 28:56.620]  That's what it's going to be kind of like.
[28:56.620 --> 29:00.940]  And then hopefully you can breed it down to where by the time you get to F5, which
[29:00.940 --> 29:05.020]  takes a long time, you guys, that is years of breeding and years of developing because
[29:05.020 --> 29:07.500]  you got to find the males and the females.
[29:07.500 --> 29:10.020]  And then sometimes you don't find what you're looking for.
[29:10.020 --> 29:12.260]  So you finish a crop and you just start over.
[29:12.260 --> 29:17.380]  And I actually searched through, I'd say 250 seeds to find an Arise male.
[29:17.380 --> 29:21.580]  And I threw away a good portion of the females that popped up because it wasn't what I needed
[29:21.580 --> 29:22.620]  at the time.
[29:22.620 --> 29:26.780]  So by the time you get to the F5, you'll be growing out these seeds and they will look
[29:26.780 --> 29:28.780]  like clones if you do it correctly.
[29:28.780 --> 29:29.780]  Five or six.
[29:29.780 --> 29:33.140]  I think F5 is about where they'll come out really close.
[29:33.140 --> 29:37.380]  F6 will look like clones, but I wouldn't want to take it that far because then nobody else
[29:37.380 --> 29:38.380]  could breed to it.
[29:38.380 --> 29:41.820]  It would just be whatever you bred to it would come out looking like that all the time.
[29:41.820 --> 29:44.220]  It'd just be real dominant genes.
[29:44.220 --> 29:48.180]  So every time you breed to it, if you do it correctly, it makes it more stable.
[29:48.180 --> 29:52.580]  So what I'm getting at is a lot of the breeders on the market right now are selling you F5
[29:52.580 --> 29:54.860]  F1s, which is not a bad thing.
[29:54.860 --> 29:56.340]  I appreciate it.
[29:56.340 --> 29:58.740]  Gage Green sells F1s.
[29:58.740 --> 30:03.060]  And one of my favorite brands to buy is Gage Green Genetics because I love the variation
[30:03.060 --> 30:04.500]  that comes in the F1.
[30:04.500 --> 30:05.940]  I get to see a lot of neat stuff.
[30:05.940 --> 30:08.820]  I actually had the honor of being a tester for Gage Green.
[30:08.820 --> 30:11.660]  So I got to see a lot of great shit come out of their garden.
[30:11.660 --> 30:13.860]  I got to test a lot of great seeds.
[30:13.860 --> 30:15.580]  I love F1s because of that.
[30:15.580 --> 30:18.420]  So you may get an F1 that takes eight weeks.
[30:18.420 --> 30:22.060]  You may get an F1 that takes nine weeks from the same exact pack of seeds.
[30:22.060 --> 30:23.140]  Now you've got a decision to make.
[30:23.140 --> 30:27.220]  Do you want to cut that one down early and change your feeding regimen and have two different
[30:27.220 --> 30:29.020]  plants that you've got to feed?
[30:29.020 --> 30:35.080]  Or do you just want to let them all go that 60 days, 64 days, 56 days?
[30:35.080 --> 30:36.080]  It's up to you.
[30:36.080 --> 30:38.860]  You get to decide that stuff, but that's a decision you've got to make.
[30:38.860 --> 30:43.660]  If you can tell early on in flower that one is kind of taken off and getting a little
[30:43.660 --> 30:44.660]  bit taller than the others.
[30:44.660 --> 30:48.300]  I mean, you may have some thinking to do right at the beginning there that may give you a
[30:48.300 --> 30:49.300]  hint.
[30:49.300 --> 30:52.980]  So different seeds are the same seed pack, different phenotypes.
[30:52.980 --> 30:54.980]  You may have different flowering times.
[30:54.980 --> 30:58.780]  I really love searching through seed packs and finding the phenotypes because depending
[30:58.780 --> 31:01.380]  on what you're working with, you may find some really great shit.
[31:01.380 --> 31:03.380]  You may also find some ridiculous stuff.
[31:03.380 --> 31:08.260]  But in the same pack, I have found completely purple buds that were short and compact and
[31:08.260 --> 31:09.820]  plants make purple, bright purple buds.
[31:09.820 --> 31:16.020]  And then I've also had plants that make tall, velvety, bright green buds, and I couldn't
[31:16.020 --> 31:17.460]  decide which phenotype to keep.
[31:17.460 --> 31:20.640]  So I kept them both and I called them just different phenotypes.
[31:20.640 --> 31:22.260]  So pheno hunting is fun.
[31:22.260 --> 31:23.260]  I really love it.
[31:23.260 --> 31:25.580]  That's one of my favorite things to do.
[31:25.580 --> 31:27.260]  So expect some variation.
[31:27.260 --> 31:33.140]  Also something I wrote down is different flowering times in different rooms and environments.
[31:33.140 --> 31:37.660]  So if I gave you clones, if I gave you clones and I gave one of your other friends clones
[31:37.660 --> 31:42.020]  and I gave a couple other guys clones and you guys all took it to your grow room, you
[31:42.020 --> 31:48.580]  may see that your room wants these plants to flower in 58 days.
[31:48.580 --> 31:51.140]  They may be perfectly finished in 58 days.
[31:51.140 --> 31:56.560]  If I give somebody else plants, they may need 63 days if we're getting right down to it.
[31:56.560 --> 31:59.100]  So environmental can have a lot to do with it.
[31:59.100 --> 32:04.340]  You guys also indoors and outdoors, you're going to see huge differences in different
[32:04.340 --> 32:05.340]  areas.
[32:05.340 --> 32:08.420]  Our buds are going to look completely different if we're growing them in California.
[32:08.420 --> 32:12.540]  If we're growing them in Colorado, altitudes make a huge difference.
[32:12.540 --> 32:15.980]  Environmental factors like that will play a huge difference in your flowering times.
[32:15.980 --> 32:16.980]  Yeah.
[32:16.980 --> 32:17.980]  All right.
[32:17.980 --> 32:19.100]  I think I've gone on for long enough.
[32:19.100 --> 32:21.060]  You guys, we're at 32 minutes now.
[32:21.060 --> 32:22.260]  So I think I'm going to wrap up the recording.
[32:22.260 --> 32:25.580]  Ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate you for listening to this long of an episode of just
[32:25.580 --> 32:26.580]  me ranting.
