[00:16.960 --> 00:21.840]  Yeah, right as the show starts I look over and Spencer's just giggling.
[00:21.840 --> 00:25.880]  Welcome to episode number 50 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[00:25.880 --> 00:27.840]  news, education and conversation.
[00:27.840 --> 00:28.840]  Dude, I'm excited.
[00:28.840 --> 00:31.160]  I can't even talk, I'm so excited.
[00:31.160 --> 00:32.460]  Everybody made it on time.
[00:32.460 --> 00:33.460]  Everybody is here.
[00:33.460 --> 00:34.460]  Welcome to episode number 50, guys.
[00:34.460 --> 00:35.780]  We're just going to introduce everybody.
[00:35.780 --> 00:37.280]  To the left, we got White Mike.
[00:37.280 --> 00:38.280]  What's up, everybody?
[00:38.280 --> 00:39.840]  To the further left, we got Jesse.
[00:39.840 --> 00:41.680]  Hey, what's up, everyone?
[00:41.680 --> 00:43.680]  Kind of to the front, we got Maddie.
[00:43.680 --> 00:44.680]  What's up, y'all?
[00:45.680 --> 00:48.680]  Just hit me in the face with a mic.
[00:48.680 --> 00:51.080]  We're already off to a great start.
[00:51.080 --> 00:54.680]  So holding a microphone over there is Spence from Garden of Weeden.
[00:54.680 --> 00:55.680]  Hello.
[00:55.680 --> 00:57.040]  Spence and Maddie are sharing a mic.
[00:57.040 --> 00:58.040]  They're holding it and-
[00:58.040 --> 01:00.280]  We're going to attempt to share the mic.
[01:00.280 --> 01:03.120]  I think that every time it's Maddie's turn to talk, she's going to get punched in the
[01:03.120 --> 01:04.120]  head with a microphone.
[01:04.120 --> 01:05.120]  For sure.
[01:05.120 --> 01:06.120]  This is going to be fun.
[01:06.120 --> 01:08.200]  I do not endorse domestic violence, but-
[01:08.200 --> 01:09.660]  No, not at all.
[01:09.660 --> 01:11.520]  But it's really cute the way it's happening.
[01:11.520 --> 01:13.040]  It's not violent, it's cute.
[01:13.040 --> 01:16.800]  Over here to my right at the three o'clock position, we got Mr. Adam Gaskins.
[01:16.800 --> 01:17.800]  How you doing, bro?
[01:17.800 --> 01:18.800]  What's up, man?
[01:18.800 --> 01:19.800]  Number 44 in the house.
[01:19.800 --> 01:20.800]  Absolutely.
[01:20.800 --> 01:21.800]  Welcome back.
[01:21.800 --> 01:22.800]  Number 50, man.
[01:22.800 --> 01:23.800]  Number 50.
[01:23.800 --> 01:24.800]  Thanks for coming.
[01:24.800 --> 01:25.800]  Everybody made it.
[01:25.800 --> 01:26.800]  I'm excited.
[01:26.800 --> 01:27.800]  Thanks a lot, you guys.
[01:27.800 --> 01:28.800]  You're welcome.
[01:28.800 --> 01:29.800]  Everyone just nodded and smiled.
[01:29.800 --> 01:30.800]  Nods and smiles don't fucking work on a podcast.
[01:30.800 --> 01:31.800]  You've got to vocalize your-
[01:31.800 --> 01:32.800]  Can't hear the-
[01:32.800 --> 01:33.800]  Can't hear your head shake.
[01:33.800 --> 01:37.000]  All the resin rocks in your head rattling around.
[01:37.000 --> 01:38.000]  So everybody brought some-
[01:38.000 --> 01:39.000]  Well, not everybody.
[01:39.000 --> 01:42.000]  Jesse brought some great prizes from Hydro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[01:42.000 --> 01:43.000]  We're just going to do this weird.
[01:43.000 --> 01:44.000]  We're just going to do it just like this.
[01:44.000 --> 01:45.000]  We'll jump and do.
[01:45.000 --> 01:47.520]  Speaking of Hydro Indoor Growing Supplies, this podcast is brought to you by Hydro Indoor
[01:47.520 --> 01:48.520]  Growing Supplies.
[01:48.520 --> 01:50.120]  A super huge shout out to Hygro.
[01:50.120 --> 01:52.120]  They have two locations to serve Colorado.
[01:52.120 --> 01:56.560]  Visit the Denver store, 6271 Beach Street, or of course, our favorite, though I can't
[01:56.560 --> 01:58.880]  even speak today, our favorite Pueblo location.
[01:58.880 --> 02:01.520]  It's 618 East 4th Street in Pueblo, Colorado.
[02:01.520 --> 02:04.720]  Don't forget, if you're listening to the Grow From Your Heart podcast, all you have to do
[02:04.720 --> 02:08.180]  is tell them you listen to the show and you will get commercial pricing when you check
[02:08.180 --> 02:09.180]  out at Hygro.
[02:09.180 --> 02:10.680]  Dude, support them.
[02:10.680 --> 02:14.800]  If you listen to the show, you will hear about some kick-ass prizes they brought today.
[02:14.800 --> 02:18.400]  It took two men, two boxes of shit to carry it into the house, and then I added more to
[02:18.400 --> 02:19.560]  it when they got here.
[02:19.560 --> 02:20.560]  So huge shout out.
[02:20.560 --> 02:21.560]  Dude, Jesse, thanks a lot, bro.
[02:21.560 --> 02:22.560]  For sure.
[02:22.560 --> 02:23.560]  I tried to save that for the show, so thank you, man, a lot.
[02:23.560 --> 02:24.560]  Oh, yeah.
[02:24.560 --> 02:25.560]  That's really cool of you.
[02:25.560 --> 02:26.560]  Yeah.
[02:26.560 --> 02:27.560]  And Adam, thanks for carrying it.
[02:27.560 --> 02:28.560]  Yeah, thanks, man.
[02:28.560 --> 02:29.560]  But for real, Jesse-
[02:29.560 --> 02:32.840]  I'm glad we have a podcast we can give them away on.
[02:32.840 --> 02:33.840]  I mean, yeah.
[02:33.840 --> 02:34.840]  Yeah.
[02:34.840 --> 02:35.840]  Dude, I hear about-
[02:35.840 --> 02:38.840]  Maddie said that one of the listeners actually showed up at the store to meet Maddie and say
[02:38.840 --> 02:40.000]  hello the other day.
[02:40.320 --> 02:41.320]  So shout out to that person.
[02:41.320 --> 02:42.320]  Do you remember their name?
[02:42.320 --> 02:43.320]  Microphone.
[02:43.320 --> 02:47.440]  I don't remember his name, but I will see him very soon because I have an order for
[02:47.440 --> 02:48.440]  him.
[02:48.440 --> 02:49.440]  Cool.
[02:49.440 --> 02:50.440]  Cool.
[02:50.440 --> 02:51.440]  Dude, thanks for listening to the show.
[02:51.440 --> 02:52.440]  We'll see you soon.
[02:52.440 --> 02:53.440]  Thanks for shopping.
[02:53.440 --> 02:54.440]  Hopefully, one time I bump into you at the store there.
[02:54.440 --> 02:55.440]  That'd be pretty cool because I shop at the store kind of frequently.
[02:55.440 --> 02:58.040]  I'm that kind of guy that never goes and gets everything I need.
[02:58.040 --> 03:03.200]  I'll go buy a bunch of shit, and as soon as I get home, I'll go, oh, yeah, I need an OGT.
[03:03.200 --> 03:04.200]  You too?
[03:04.200 --> 03:05.560]  That one thing that you needed and you always forget.
[03:05.560 --> 03:06.560]  Always.
[03:06.560 --> 03:08.040]  Yeah, and I try to stand around in the store and look around like, what is it?
[03:08.040 --> 03:09.040]  What is it?
[03:09.080 --> 03:10.080]  I don't know if we all do the same thing.
[03:10.080 --> 03:14.080]  It's not just because I literally go and just people ask me, can I help you up?
[03:14.080 --> 03:16.200]  I got no, I'm just looking.
[03:16.200 --> 03:17.200]  I forgot.
[03:17.200 --> 03:18.200]  Do you need anything?
[03:18.200 --> 03:19.200]  Yeah.
[03:19.200 --> 03:20.200]  Yeah.
[03:20.200 --> 03:21.200]  This shelf here and everywhere over that way.
[03:21.200 --> 03:22.200]  I remember I was thinking about cutting clones.
[03:22.200 --> 03:23.200]  It's got to be in the cloning area.
[03:23.200 --> 03:24.200]  I could use about six of those.
[03:24.200 --> 03:25.200]  You needed clone X and you went home without clone X, right?
[03:25.200 --> 03:26.200]  That was the only thing you needed.
[03:26.200 --> 03:27.200]  All right.
[03:27.200 --> 03:28.200]  I do need to send a big thank you shout out to the Mystic Roots band for letting me use
[03:28.200 --> 03:29.200]  their music on the show.
[03:29.200 --> 03:30.200]  Thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew, the Stay Positive Productions crew.
[03:30.200 --> 03:31.200]  It's really awesome.
[03:31.200 --> 03:32.200]  It's been a blast.
[03:32.200 --> 03:33.200]  Thank you.
[03:33.200 --> 03:34.880]  Shout out to the Mystic Roots band for letting me use their music on the show.
[03:34.880 --> 03:38.360]  Thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew, the Stay Positive Productions
[03:38.360 --> 03:39.360]  crew.
[03:39.360 --> 03:40.360]  It's really awesome.
[03:40.360 --> 03:41.360]  They let me use their song on the show.
[03:41.360 --> 03:42.360]  I appreciate that.
[03:42.360 --> 03:45.920]  That was the most important paper I had to get through.
[03:45.920 --> 03:47.340]  Mike brought up a really interesting topic.
[03:47.340 --> 03:49.660]  We were going to do some giveaways and shit, but I got a couple of things to talk about
[03:49.660 --> 03:50.660]  before we get into there.
[03:50.660 --> 03:51.960]  Mike brought up a really interesting topic.
[03:51.960 --> 03:52.960]  I saw it.
[03:52.960 --> 03:53.960]  You guys might've seen it on TMZ.
[03:53.960 --> 03:56.080]  I saw it online this morning.
[03:56.080 --> 04:01.040]  Ralphie May came to Colorado and had himself a little accident with some edibles right
[04:01.040 --> 04:03.760]  before a performance apparently.
[04:03.760 --> 04:08.960]  The police had to be called to quiet the pissed crowd when Ralphie was way too zonked to even
[04:08.960 --> 04:10.640]  finish a sentence.
[04:10.640 --> 04:14.880]  They showed video of Ralphie May being escorted out of the back of the comedy club by the
[04:14.880 --> 04:19.080]  police because the crowd was so pissed off at him they were demanding their money back.
[04:19.080 --> 04:21.280]  He was just smiling and like, I love you guys.
[04:21.280 --> 04:22.440]  I don't know what happened.
[04:22.440 --> 04:24.000]  You wouldn't let me do my bits.
[04:24.000 --> 04:26.280]  He was waving like he was a princess or some shit.
[04:26.280 --> 04:28.120]  It was really fucking funny.
[04:28.120 --> 04:30.640]  I haven't seen Ralphie May high as shit before.
[04:30.640 --> 04:32.480]  I've never seen Ralphie May that high.
[04:32.480 --> 04:34.240]  He talked about doing a lot of drugs.
[04:34.240 --> 04:35.800]  You gotta read the labels people.
[04:35.800 --> 04:36.800]  Read the labels.
[04:36.800 --> 04:37.800]  Yeah.
[04:37.800 --> 04:38.800]  They didn't say small.
[04:38.800 --> 04:41.320]  Fun size don't mean fun size.
[04:41.320 --> 04:42.320]  Read the label.
[04:42.320 --> 04:43.320]  Yeah.
[04:43.320 --> 04:44.320]  Well you know it's Ralphie May.
[04:44.320 --> 04:47.400]  He probably ate something and went, damn this is delicious and just started eating all of
[04:47.400 --> 04:48.400]  them.
[04:48.400 --> 04:49.400]  Did that happen?
[04:49.400 --> 04:50.400]  He ate the rest of it.
[04:50.400 --> 04:51.400]  Sometimes the arm eats for you.
[04:51.400 --> 04:52.400]  You don't even know you're doing it.
[04:52.400 --> 04:56.280]  He's kind of a big dude so he probably thought a thousand milligrams ain't shit for me.
[04:56.280 --> 04:57.280]  Oops.
[04:57.280 --> 04:59.720]  His brain is just the same size as everybody else's.
[04:59.800 --> 05:00.800]  Alright.
[05:00.800 --> 05:01.800]  Shout out to Ralphie May.
[05:01.800 --> 05:04.600]  This episode won't be out for like two weeks so that'll be old news by then but we read
[05:04.600 --> 05:05.600]  it today.
[05:05.600 --> 05:06.600]  We thought it was freaking hilarious.
[05:06.600 --> 05:08.320]  Ralphie May, you're the new Maureen O'Dowd.
[05:08.320 --> 05:09.680]  I hope you work that into your next bit.
[05:09.680 --> 05:11.440]  I hope that's funny at some point.
[05:11.440 --> 05:12.440]  That's good.
[05:12.440 --> 05:13.440]  Yeah.
[05:13.440 --> 05:18.160]  Tonight, it'll be too late, but the new Ari Shafir comedy special is on at midnight tonight.
[05:18.160 --> 05:19.600]  I'm gonna catch that.
[05:19.600 --> 05:20.600]  Yeah.
[05:20.600 --> 05:24.000]  Paid regular with Ari, one of my favorite comedians.
[05:24.000 --> 05:28.680]  When Spence was here last time we talked about the best shit of the year 2014 and we left
[05:28.680 --> 05:31.320]  out something super duper freaking important.
[05:31.320 --> 05:32.320]  What was that?
[05:32.320 --> 05:33.880]  We didn't even mention live resin.
[05:33.880 --> 05:34.880]  Oh yeah.
[05:34.880 --> 05:35.880]  Unicorn hash.
[05:35.880 --> 05:36.880]  Yeah.
[05:36.880 --> 05:43.120]  Well, the only reason we probably didn't talk about it is because it's nothing new to us.
[05:43.120 --> 05:45.080]  Yeah, but it was like the thing for 2014.
[05:45.080 --> 05:47.760]  It was something we definitely should have talked about.
[05:47.760 --> 05:52.440]  We talked to people today that were like, I still haven't seen any live resin and then
[05:52.440 --> 05:56.800]  just Joe Blow pulls something out of his pocket like, yo, I got something right here.
[05:56.920 --> 06:03.280]  And it's just like, the guy's just like, oh, he's wanting to enter some shit to a competition
[06:03.280 --> 06:06.600]  and it's like, you just won.
[06:06.600 --> 06:07.600]  Yeah.
[06:07.600 --> 06:10.240]  No, live resin is definitely a big pickup.
[06:10.240 --> 06:15.600]  Something new, especially with the addition of closed loop, it kind of really came about.
[06:15.600 --> 06:17.160]  Shout out to Emotech.
[06:17.160 --> 06:18.160]  Yeah.
[06:18.160 --> 06:24.560]  Shout out to Giddy, Emotech, Kind Bill, that whole crew that kind of put the forward push.
[06:24.560 --> 06:25.560]  Yeah.
[06:25.600 --> 06:27.000]  Live resin did a lot for you, of course.
[06:27.000 --> 06:28.840]  It did a lot for Emotech and Giddy.
[06:28.840 --> 06:32.560]  It did a lot for Hanky Bee and the greener side, kind of.
[06:32.560 --> 06:37.160]  As a residual, it actually, your win in the secret cup boosted up my Instagram following.
[06:37.160 --> 06:38.400]  It made me more known.
[06:38.400 --> 06:41.720]  So yeah, live resin kind of boosted us all up in the scene a little bit.
[06:41.720 --> 06:42.720]  Yeah, for sure.
[06:42.720 --> 06:43.720]  I mean, yeah, definitely.
[06:43.720 --> 06:45.640]  I can't believe we forgot about live on the year review episode.
[06:45.640 --> 06:46.640]  Yeah, that was big.
[06:46.640 --> 06:47.640]  Yeah, huge.
[06:47.640 --> 06:49.400]  Maddie's shaking her head all flabbergasted.
[06:49.400 --> 06:50.560]  I can't believe we did either.
[06:50.560 --> 06:55.880]  That was such a big part of the end of our year, especially with the secret cup.
[06:55.880 --> 06:58.360]  And it was awesome to win the secret cup regionals.
[06:58.360 --> 06:59.360]  That was awesome.
[06:59.360 --> 07:02.200]  We met a lot of people in Denver through that.
[07:02.200 --> 07:03.200]  Yeah.
[07:03.200 --> 07:06.200]  And people still talk to me like, I'm part of your crew.
[07:06.200 --> 07:07.200]  You grew that well.
[07:07.200 --> 07:08.520]  And I'm like, I didn't grow it, dude.
[07:08.520 --> 07:09.520]  They grow it.
[07:09.520 --> 07:10.760]  They fucking pop the seeds.
[07:10.760 --> 07:11.760]  They shatter it.
[07:11.760 --> 07:12.760]  They blast it.
[07:12.760 --> 07:13.760]  It's all them.
[07:13.760 --> 07:14.760]  So I have to correct people.
[07:14.760 --> 07:15.760]  And I let them know that you grew that.
[07:15.760 --> 07:17.640]  I never take credit for your guys' grow.
[07:17.640 --> 07:18.720]  I didn't grow that stuff, you guys.
[07:18.720 --> 07:19.720]  It was them.
[07:19.880 --> 07:20.880]  I didn't grow that stuff.
[07:20.880 --> 07:21.880]  I grew the oil.
[07:21.880 --> 07:22.880]  Yeah.
[07:22.880 --> 07:24.960]  Actually, the stuff for, I may have grown a couple of theirs, but I've taken credit
[07:24.960 --> 07:25.960]  for those.
[07:25.960 --> 07:27.560]  So this is kind of a random note.
[07:27.560 --> 07:32.160]  A lady messaged me on Instagram and kind of called me out.
[07:32.160 --> 07:35.640]  She said that, and I'm sure I said this, but I don't remember the exact words.
[07:35.640 --> 07:40.000]  In an older episode, I kind of tried to cover my ass legally with a disclaimer.
[07:40.000 --> 07:44.120]  Like if you live in an illegal state, don't grow weed, follow the rules and all that shit.
[07:44.120 --> 07:46.480]  I got to say that kind of shit to cover my ass.
[07:46.480 --> 07:50.000]  I don't know technically if I come on the air and I say, hey, if you live in Florida,
[07:50.000 --> 07:51.760]  fuck all the rules, grow all the weed you can.
[07:51.760 --> 07:53.240]  I don't know if I'm going to get in trouble for that.
[07:53.240 --> 07:56.760]  So to cover my own ass, I just say follow the rules, you guys.
[07:56.760 --> 07:58.640]  But I think that you should grow your own cannabis.
[07:58.640 --> 08:02.360]  If you're smoking cannabis, if you're consuming cannabis, if you like it recreationally, if
[08:02.360 --> 08:05.360]  you like it medically, grow the fuck out of it everywhere.
[08:05.360 --> 08:06.360]  That's my new stance on it.
[08:06.360 --> 08:07.360]  Overgrow the government.
[08:07.360 --> 08:08.360]  They can't arrest us all.
[08:08.360 --> 08:12.160]  They might arrest me for saying that, but if they do, somebody else make a badass podcast
[08:12.160 --> 08:14.200]  and keep this going for me.
[08:14.640 --> 08:20.480]  If you are going to do it illegally, if you do it somewhat responsibly and you're willing
[08:20.480 --> 08:22.760]  to go to court for that, then so be it.
[08:22.760 --> 08:28.920]  You may be the change that your state or your community is needed.
[08:28.920 --> 08:29.920]  So plant more seeds.
[08:29.920 --> 08:30.920]  You guys grow more weed.
[08:30.920 --> 08:31.920]  I can't be a hypocrite.
[08:31.920 --> 08:32.920]  I grow a lot of cannabis.
[08:32.920 --> 08:34.520]  I think you should too, but also know the risks.
[08:34.520 --> 08:37.400]  If you've got kids in the house, you can lose the kids.
[08:37.400 --> 08:40.800]  When the DA comes, they're going to shoot your dog most likely when they come in the
[08:40.800 --> 08:41.800]  door.
[08:41.800 --> 08:42.800]  Think about that kind of shit.
[08:42.800 --> 08:43.800]  It's going to be traumatizing.
[08:44.400 --> 08:45.400]  It's going to mess up your life.
[08:45.400 --> 08:48.640]  If you're prepared for that, if you can handle that, if you're a man and or woman enough,
[08:48.640 --> 08:50.760]  if you're transgender enough, I'm not trying to exclude anybody.
[08:50.760 --> 08:52.320]  I'm trying to include all of you.
[08:52.320 --> 08:56.320]  If you are a person enough and you can handle that shit, grow cannabis, do your thing.
[08:56.320 --> 08:57.560]  Just know what the risks are.
[08:57.560 --> 08:58.560]  There we go.
[08:58.560 --> 09:00.280]  I'm not being a hypocrite.
[09:00.280 --> 09:04.160]  If you're, yeah, she also called me out for dabbing in the car and telling people not
[09:04.160 --> 09:05.160]  to.
[09:05.160 --> 09:06.160]  I'm a professional lady.
[09:06.160 --> 09:07.160]  I could dab in the car.
[09:07.160 --> 09:09.160]  If you find yourself to be a professional, dab in the car.
[09:09.160 --> 09:11.000]  The people I was talking shit to were not professional.
[09:11.000 --> 09:12.880]  I'm a professional car dabber.
[09:12.960 --> 09:15.960]  We've got a nice little system in my car.
[09:15.960 --> 09:16.960]  Absolutely.
[09:16.960 --> 09:22.080]  I've been there with him and it's always parked in very certain locations where it's like
[09:22.080 --> 09:23.720]  this is dab approved.
[09:23.720 --> 09:24.720]  I know good spots.
[09:24.720 --> 09:25.720]  Yeah.
[09:25.720 --> 09:26.720]  We have specific travel routes.
[09:26.720 --> 09:29.680]  We're not pulling up next to the park like, hey, see those kids in the swing over there?
[09:29.680 --> 09:32.520]  No, it ain't happening like that.
[09:32.520 --> 09:38.440]  I understand certain places between here and like Boulder, Longmont, Broomfield, Fort Collins
[09:38.440 --> 09:39.880]  that I know to pull off.
[09:39.880 --> 09:40.880]  I can pull off right here.
[09:40.880 --> 09:42.280]  There's a little gas station with a car wash.
[09:42.680 --> 09:46.320]  I love to go in the car wash at the gas station and get my car washed and take a dab while
[09:46.320 --> 09:47.320]  it's washing the car.
[09:47.320 --> 09:48.320]  I've never even considered that before.
[09:48.320 --> 09:50.520]  Now that you've said that, I have to try it.
[09:50.520 --> 09:51.520]  Nobody can see you.
[09:51.520 --> 09:53.880]  Your car is covered at all angles and you're just in there dabbing out.
[09:53.880 --> 09:55.680]  You have the Master Shake too.
[09:55.680 --> 09:57.740]  That's a perfect little car rig.
[09:57.740 --> 09:58.740]  It's hard for the car.
[09:58.740 --> 10:00.680]  A Master Shake is a little 10 mil rig.
[10:00.680 --> 10:02.040]  There's no way to hold it up in the car.
[10:02.040 --> 10:03.040]  There's nowhere to put it.
[10:03.040 --> 10:04.440]  It just falls over when you drive.
[10:04.440 --> 10:06.280]  This is mostly the Hitman Mini Cake.
[10:06.280 --> 10:07.280]  The cake rig fits the couple.
[10:07.280 --> 10:08.280]  Yeah, it fits in the couple.
[10:08.280 --> 10:09.280]  It's a good fit.
[10:09.280 --> 10:10.280]  It's a good fit.
[10:10.280 --> 10:11.280]  It's a good fit.
[10:11.280 --> 10:12.280]  This is Colorado.
[10:12.280 --> 10:16.280]  I've seen more than one e-nail set up in a car.
[10:16.280 --> 10:18.280]  Shout out to Otis Dabs.
[10:18.280 --> 10:19.280]  Big shout out to Otis.
[10:19.280 --> 10:20.280]  That's sophisticated.
[10:20.280 --> 10:22.800]  Otis is always driving with the Peli nail in the car.
[10:22.800 --> 10:24.480]  You see that dude dabbing in strip clubs, dabbing in dinners.
[10:24.480 --> 10:26.880]  He also dabbed on an airplane.
[10:26.880 --> 10:29.040]  Did he really take the dab or did he just show off the rig?
[10:29.040 --> 10:30.040]  I didn't see the dab part.
[10:30.040 --> 10:33.280]  He took a real dab on the plane.
[10:33.280 --> 10:34.280]  Win.
[10:34.280 --> 10:35.280]  Winner.
[10:35.280 --> 10:37.040]  Winner, winner, vegan dinner.
[10:37.040 --> 10:38.440]  With a torch or a dab?
[10:38.440 --> 10:39.480]  With a torch.
[10:39.480 --> 10:41.880]  And took a dab in the bathroom and blew it out.
[10:41.880 --> 10:42.880]  Took a video.
[10:42.880 --> 10:43.880]  It was on Instagram.
[10:43.880 --> 10:44.880]  I don't know if it's still there.
[10:44.880 --> 10:45.880]  I don't know if it's still there or not.
[10:45.880 --> 10:46.880]  If GSA had a problem with it, they would have jacked it at security.
[10:46.880 --> 10:47.880]  So shout out to that lady that kind of called me out.
[10:47.880 --> 10:48.880]  I guess I might have been hypocritical, but honestly, I was just trying to cover my own
[10:48.880 --> 10:49.880]  ass is all.
[10:49.880 --> 10:50.880]  I'm trying not to go to jail and trying to keep this podcast going.
[10:50.880 --> 10:51.880]  I can't tell people in fucking Texas to grow weed and not think that I'm going to get in
[10:51.880 --> 10:52.880]  trouble, but guess what?
[10:52.880 --> 10:53.880]  If you're in Texas, grow some fucking weed, dude.
[10:53.880 --> 10:54.880]  Grow it.
[10:54.880 --> 10:55.880]  Grow it with all your heart.
[10:55.880 --> 10:56.880]  I would think that.
[10:56.880 --> 10:57.880]  I would think that.
[10:57.880 --> 10:58.880]  I would think that.
[10:58.880 --> 10:59.880]  I would think that.
[11:10.040 --> 11:12.400]  to figure out what our opinion was.
[11:12.400 --> 11:13.400]  Yeah.
[11:13.400 --> 11:16.400]  I don't think you're really putting off a role model vibe.
[11:16.400 --> 11:19.940]  It's more or less you want to put the correct information out there for people.
[11:19.940 --> 11:20.940]  Yeah.
[11:20.940 --> 11:21.940]  Yeah.
[11:21.940 --> 11:24.160]  Well, she called me out and I guess she was right because I did say, don't do this.
[11:24.160 --> 11:25.780]  And I guess I can't be a bitch about it.
[11:25.780 --> 11:27.160]  Just want a man up to that one.
[11:27.160 --> 11:30.560]  Where was I going to go from there?
[11:30.560 --> 11:32.520]  Do we want to start this big old list of shout outs?
[11:32.520 --> 11:33.880]  I'm only like 11 minutes into the show.
[11:33.880 --> 11:35.640]  I do have one more thing I have to do.
[11:35.640 --> 11:38.080]  I just looked down this podcast is brought to you by nature's green remedies.com.

[12:04.080 --> 12:10.080]  Dude, you guys probably don't care but the Grateful Dead is playing at Soldier Field in Chicago with Trey Anastasio on guitar.
[12:10.080 --> 12:17.080]  I'm sure there will be articles about that on treethugger.com. So check out treethugger.com, live music lifestyle magazine.
[12:17.080 --> 12:21.080]  Sorry for stumbling through the ads. I just want to get them done. I promise I'll do those for people.
[12:21.080 --> 12:23.080]  Just wanted to throw that in there. You know, it's what I got to do.
[12:23.080 --> 12:28.080]  Also, if you're interested in sponsoring the show, send me an email. It's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com. I'll get you all that info.
[12:28.080 --> 12:31.080]  That's all the technical stuff for now. We're not going to do any more of that.
[12:32.080 --> 12:36.080]  Alright, let's read this big old list of shoutouts. I'll let you guys go first.
[12:36.080 --> 12:41.080]  Mike, if you got anybody that you want to shout out or say anything to because this is episode 50.
[12:41.080 --> 12:44.080]  It's kind of time for like a celebration before we start giving away prizes and shit.
[12:44.080 --> 12:48.080]  Everyone's looking at their phones like shout out to you, bud. 50's huge.
[12:48.080 --> 12:50.080]  Right? Well, thank you guys for coming. All of you guys are...
[12:50.080 --> 12:53.080]  Clint and Sean should be here but there aren't enough chairs, dude.
[12:53.080 --> 12:57.080]  If I had two more chairs, Sean and Clint would have been my next options to have here.
[12:57.080 --> 13:01.080]  I want to save Sean for when it's just kind of focused. We can talk about some shit.
[13:01.080 --> 13:04.080]  And Clint would just derail the whole fucking thing.
[13:04.080 --> 13:09.080]  That would be kind of fun just to have them both on and Clint would just sit there and poke fun at him the whole time.
[13:09.080 --> 13:10.080]  He not know what to do.
[13:10.080 --> 13:12.080]  Keep going, bro. I'm sorry. I totally interrupted you. Bad host.
[13:12.080 --> 13:16.080]  That's all I got right now. It's Yeti OG dabs.
[13:16.080 --> 13:17.080]  Nice.
[13:17.080 --> 13:20.080]  I wasn't expecting to thank people.
[13:20.080 --> 13:24.080]  50's huge, man. I've been looking forward to this for a while. Thanks for the microphone.
[13:24.080 --> 13:29.080]  Thanks for coming on and you keep us updated with our local politics and the local shit that we need to be aware of.
[13:29.080 --> 13:35.080]  And I think that reminding us about our local stuff teaches our listeners that they can participate too and it gets them off the couch.
[13:35.080 --> 13:39.080]  Which is what we need. You can be an activist in so many ways but you gotta get off the couch to do it.
[13:39.080 --> 13:41.080]  Be ready to do local political work.
[13:41.080 --> 13:50.080]  If marijuana is getting legalized in your state, as soon as it's legal at the state level, all sorts of nightmarish work begins at the local level with the city and county level.
[13:51.080 --> 13:56.080]  If you don't have somebody in your crew ready to step up on that, it's not going to go the way you want it to.
[13:56.080 --> 13:58.080]  And you're looking at local bands like Colorado Springs.
[13:58.080 --> 14:02.080]  I'm impressed with how friendly you have become with some city council members.
[14:02.080 --> 14:06.080]  We'll be hanging out taking dabs and the phone will ring and he'll be like, oh, that's this city council member.
[14:06.080 --> 14:07.080]  Excuse me for a minute.
[14:07.080 --> 14:14.080]  And I'm like, bro, you're at my house taking dabs, listening to reggae and you're going to excuse yourself to go talk to the city council manager.
[14:14.080 --> 14:15.080]  Okay.
[14:15.080 --> 14:17.080]  They're people too, bro.
[14:17.080 --> 14:19.080]  If you call them, they call you back.
[14:19.080 --> 14:24.080]  Their job is to keep the constituents happy and it doesn't matter how often you dab, you're a constituent.
[14:24.080 --> 14:25.080]  It's pretty killer.
[14:25.080 --> 14:28.080]  I like that you've developed that relationship for us because I know it's not my spot.
[14:28.080 --> 14:30.080]  It's fully my cross to bear.
[14:30.080 --> 14:32.080]  I can see why it's like my wheelhouse.
[14:32.080 --> 14:38.080]  And honestly, I don't see myself knowing what you know about growing or knowing what Spence knows about Blast.
[14:38.080 --> 14:41.080]  And it's just, I know about zoning.
[14:43.080 --> 14:45.080]  We need someone like that.
[14:45.080 --> 14:46.080]  It's all good.
[14:46.080 --> 14:47.080]  Me doing your job.
[14:47.080 --> 14:48.080]  Speaking of zoning.
[14:48.080 --> 14:52.080]  Both of you looking at me going, thank fucking God you're here because I'm going to fucking do it.
[14:52.080 --> 14:53.080]  Yeah.
[14:53.080 --> 14:54.080]  Everybody needs someone like you.
[14:54.080 --> 14:59.080]  I go to city council meetings occasionally and I know I don't go enough, but I'm intimidated, dude.
[14:59.080 --> 15:01.080]  It's like going in like, hi, I'm the pot grower.
[15:01.080 --> 15:02.080]  And it just feels weird.
[15:02.080 --> 15:03.080]  Yeah.
[15:03.080 --> 15:04.080]  Like, yeah.
[15:04.080 --> 15:05.080]  You get some looks.
[15:05.080 --> 15:06.080]  Some looks.
[15:06.080 --> 15:09.080]  I got Jedi stared for half the session last time.
[15:09.080 --> 15:12.080]  Dude with the stars on his chest was like, I don't like you.
[15:12.080 --> 15:13.080]  Burning holes in my shirt.
[15:13.080 --> 15:15.080]  Jesse, that's a killer shirt, by the way.
[15:15.080 --> 15:18.080]  Shout out to Heavy 16 for all the goodies that we get to give away from them.
[15:18.080 --> 15:21.080]  Do you got anybody to thank or any shout outs for the show?
[15:21.080 --> 15:23.080]  I know we're only like 11 minutes in.
[15:23.080 --> 15:25.080]  Yeti OG, Live Resin.
[15:25.080 --> 15:26.080]  Yeah, there you go.
[15:26.080 --> 15:27.080]  Nice.
[15:30.080 --> 15:31.080]  My beautiful wife.
[15:31.080 --> 15:32.080]  There you go.
[15:32.080 --> 15:33.080]  Congrats on the wedding this year.
[15:33.080 --> 15:37.080]  That was one of the coolest weddings, if not the coolest wedding I've ever been to.
[15:37.080 --> 15:39.080]  It was by far the drunkest I've ever been at a wedding.
[15:39.080 --> 15:44.080]  Maddie and I got to give out Live Res dabs to everybody all night.
[15:44.080 --> 15:45.080]  That was kind of fun.
[15:45.080 --> 15:46.080]  Full on dab bar.
[15:46.080 --> 15:47.080]  Full on dab bar.
[15:47.080 --> 15:50.080]  She doesn't have a mic, but most of you guys probably caught that from the echo in the room.
[15:50.080 --> 15:55.080]  I had someone ask me to plan their reception for them the other day.
[15:55.080 --> 15:56.080]  Does that mean we get to go?
[15:56.080 --> 15:58.080]  You got to hire us.
[15:58.080 --> 15:59.080]  It's pretty easy.
[15:59.080 --> 16:02.080]  You just, yeah, show up with a bunch of hash.
[16:02.080 --> 16:03.080]  Yeah.
[16:03.080 --> 16:04.080]  Shit ton of beer.
[16:04.080 --> 16:06.080]  You're starting another impromptu company now?
[16:06.080 --> 16:07.080]  Oh, Jesus.
[16:07.080 --> 16:08.080]  Hey, hey.
[16:08.080 --> 16:09.080]  Hash weddings.
[16:09.080 --> 16:10.080]  All right.
[16:10.080 --> 16:13.080]  So Maddie just grabbed the mic from Spence.
[16:13.080 --> 16:14.080]  It looks like she's prepared.
[16:14.080 --> 16:16.080]  You got any shout outs for the girl over there?
[16:16.080 --> 16:21.080]  I wanted to give a huge shout out to our crew from NC in Colorado.
[16:21.080 --> 16:27.080]  They have really stepped up their game this year and all learned how to grow some killer weed.
[16:27.080 --> 16:35.080]  Granted, they have some good friends to help them learn, but our friends really stepped up and started growing some amazing cannabis this year.
[16:36.080 --> 16:39.080]  They deserve a big shout out for that.
[16:39.080 --> 16:41.080]  Good genetics go a long way also.
[16:41.080 --> 16:42.080]  I've seen a lot.
[16:42.080 --> 16:43.080]  I'm kind of going to brag on that.
[16:43.080 --> 16:51.080]  Yeah, shout out to all those guys because a lot of them, you guys have passed on iRegenetic seeds to a lot of that crew and they are freaking killing it on Instagram.
[16:51.080 --> 16:52.080]  So you're totally right.
[16:52.080 --> 16:54.080]  We love to suggest iRegenetics.
[16:54.080 --> 16:58.080]  It's a great place to get reliable genetics from.
[16:58.080 --> 16:59.080]  Well, thank you.
[16:59.080 --> 17:01.080]  No problem.
[17:01.080 --> 17:02.080]  Yeah, I wish I could give.
[17:02.080 --> 17:06.080]  Unfortunately, you guys, there aren't any seeds in the prize packages because of legal reasons.
[17:06.080 --> 17:12.080]  These prizes are available to almost anybody in the United States unless you're here at the table or you're too closely affiliated with the show.
[17:12.080 --> 17:15.080]  By the way, I make the fucking rules and they can change anytime I decide they change.
[17:15.080 --> 17:17.080]  Mad jealous for that.
[17:17.080 --> 17:19.080]  These prize packs are sick, guys.
[17:19.080 --> 17:21.080]  I don't even remember where I was headed with that.
[17:21.080 --> 17:23.080]  Yeah, anyway, anybody can get the prizes.
[17:23.080 --> 17:25.080]  Yeah, so there can't be seeds in there.
[17:25.080 --> 17:26.080]  That's what I was saying.
[17:26.080 --> 17:27.080]  There can't be seeds in there.
[17:27.080 --> 17:28.080]  I'm sorry.
[17:28.080 --> 17:32.080]  I'm going to make a Colorado local contest where I can put some iRi seeds in there eventually.
[17:32.080 --> 17:33.080]  I just got to figure out how to do that.
[17:33.080 --> 17:34.080]  It'll just be a local thing.
[17:34.080 --> 17:36.080]  So, yeah, big shout out to all those guys.
[17:36.080 --> 17:38.080]  Dude, Maddie, you sound great on a microphone.
[17:38.080 --> 17:40.080]  You need to be podcasting all the time.
[17:40.080 --> 17:41.080]  Thank you.
[17:41.080 --> 17:42.080]  Yeah, you're nice.
[17:42.080 --> 17:47.080]  Well, we have a discussion table every night when we take daps.
[17:47.080 --> 17:52.080]  We usually just have a session, sit down and talk for an hour or two and just bullshit.
[17:52.080 --> 17:55.080]  And honestly, it could be on a podcast.
[17:55.080 --> 17:59.080]  That's why I've said it before on the show that your table was part of what inspired this podcast.
[17:59.080 --> 18:05.080]  Your guys' friend, I won't say his name, he used to come and pick my brain for two hours at a time at your table.
[18:05.080 --> 18:09.080]  And then I thought I should record all this or write it down and just refer him to my recordings.
[18:09.080 --> 18:12.080]  I wish I could just bring thoughts back that I have.
[18:12.080 --> 18:15.080]  Like I remember something we were talking about, but I don't remember the specifics.
[18:15.080 --> 18:23.080]  One time on an older podcast that I used to do, shout out to 719 the Blocks, on that podcast, we had a recording issue.
[18:23.080 --> 18:27.080]  And our whole recording got lost and we decided let's just try to redo it and mimic it.
[18:27.080 --> 18:29.080]  About 10 minutes in, we're like, this feels so fake.
[18:29.080 --> 18:32.080]  There's no way to bring back those thoughts in that conversation.
[18:32.080 --> 18:33.080]  So we just gave up.
[18:33.080 --> 18:34.080]  We're like, no.
[18:34.080 --> 18:37.080]  So remaking a talk isn't it's not the most legit thing.
[18:37.080 --> 18:42.080]  We've sat here and tried to make a podcast four or five times in one night and it just didn't work.
[18:42.080 --> 18:46.080]  Yeah, it was about episode 13 or 15 ish around that area.
[18:46.080 --> 18:47.080]  It was cut.
[18:47.080 --> 18:48.080]  I don't know if it was dabs.
[18:48.080 --> 18:50.080]  Everything's better when it's not forced.
[18:50.080 --> 18:52.080]  Yeah, I just I wasn't feeling it.
[18:52.080 --> 18:56.080]  It was time to record and I just wasn't in the mood and now I'm I'm way more comfortable at it.
[18:56.080 --> 18:58.080]  So 50 episodes in on this show.
[18:58.080 --> 19:01.080]  And then I did about 50 with another show also.
[19:01.080 --> 19:03.080]  So I had some time to get comfortable.
[19:03.080 --> 19:05.080]  Yeah, I've only been a host for 50 episodes.
[19:05.080 --> 19:07.080]  I feel like I've only been a host for about 30 episodes.
[19:07.080 --> 19:08.080]  Tell you the truth.
[19:08.080 --> 19:09.080]  It took me 20, 25 to get there.
[19:09.080 --> 19:10.080]  It flew by.
[19:10.080 --> 19:11.080]  Yeah, yeah.
[19:11.080 --> 19:15.080]  I'm thinking about doing more frequent episodes because we get more listens when they're more frequent.
[19:15.080 --> 19:17.080]  But I don't want to bore people also.
[19:17.080 --> 19:19.080]  I don't want to be that podcast.
[19:19.080 --> 19:20.080]  Flood them with information.
[19:20.080 --> 19:25.080]  I don't want to have to listen to people who have been on my podcast for years for three months and then comes out with the show and then comes out and apologizes.
[19:25.080 --> 19:31.080]  But then I also don't want you to have to listen to me four times a week like Joe Rogan because I don't even have time to hear all the Joe Rogan stuff.
[19:31.080 --> 19:32.080]  Joe Rogan's a busy dude.
[19:32.080 --> 19:33.080]  Yeah, yeah.
[19:33.080 --> 19:34.080]  All right.
[19:34.080 --> 19:35.080]  Spence just grabbed the mic from Maddy.
[19:35.080 --> 19:36.080]  He smacked her with it violently.
[19:36.080 --> 19:41.080]  It's acute violence when they do it.
[19:41.080 --> 19:42.080]  How about you, Spence?
[19:42.080 --> 19:43.080]  You got any shout outs for the year?
[19:43.080 --> 19:45.080]  Oh, let's see.
[19:46.080 --> 19:52.080]  Shout out to all the people who breed seeds and give me free seeds to grow.
[19:52.080 --> 19:54.080]  I appreciate that.
[19:54.080 --> 19:59.080]  And the people that hook me up with the genetics.
[19:59.080 --> 20:02.080]  I've had genetics from California, Seattle.
[20:02.080 --> 20:06.080]  So shout out to all the people out there that have passed on genetics.
[20:06.080 --> 20:13.080]  Now it's kind of something that should be done now is kind of share the genetics for people.
[20:14.080 --> 20:16.080]  There's always going to be cuts people are going to hold.
[20:16.080 --> 20:17.080]  That's just how it works.
[20:17.080 --> 20:23.440]  But you could still share at the same time.
[20:23.440 --> 20:26.440]  Sharing is great here.
[20:26.440 --> 20:28.440]  It's all good.
[20:28.440 --> 20:29.440]  I just tried to step in.
[20:29.440 --> 20:31.440]  Somebody had to do something here.
[20:31.440 --> 20:33.440]  The host goes to take a dab at all of us.
[20:33.440 --> 20:35.440]  Just look at it awkwardly.
[20:35.440 --> 20:40.440]  My carb cap was clogged, so I was fucking choking on it too.
[20:40.440 --> 20:41.440]  That was weak.
[20:41.440 --> 20:43.440]  I'm going to clean that out a little bit.
[20:43.440 --> 20:45.440]  Sharing is good here in Colorado.
[20:45.440 --> 20:48.440]  Try not to be a clone hoarder.
[20:48.440 --> 20:52.440]  I know that's hypocritical because I'm a breeder and I'm kind of a clone hoarder.
[20:52.440 --> 20:55.440]  Everybody's going to keep your special genetics, but everybody's got those couple that...
[20:55.440 --> 20:59.440]  If you've got something that's high in CBD or is really good medicine, get it out there.
[20:59.440 --> 21:00.440]  If it's medicine, share.
[21:00.440 --> 21:02.440]  Cuts are one thing. Seeds are another.
[21:02.440 --> 21:04.440]  Seeds are available.
[21:04.440 --> 21:06.440]  I think seeds should be given out.
[21:06.440 --> 21:09.440]  That's part of why you guys are frustrated with me.
[21:09.440 --> 21:11.440]  There's not a lot of stuff at naturesgreenremedies.com.
[21:11.440 --> 21:13.440]  It's because all my locals are getting it.
[21:13.440 --> 21:18.440]  There is obviously a markup when you go through a dealer or distributor.
[21:18.440 --> 21:23.440]  I'm skipping that markup and getting the seeds to my locals at wholesale prices because it feels good doing that.
[21:23.440 --> 21:26.440]  Sorry that you guys didn't get a lot on naturesgreenremedies.
[21:26.440 --> 21:29.440]  The whole batch will probably go to you because my locals are served up.
[21:29.440 --> 21:31.440]  Everybody's fed.
[21:31.440 --> 21:38.440]  Nine times out of ten, that's a lot of times 90% you would say would go to naturesgreenremedies and only 5% stays here.
[21:38.440 --> 21:40.440]  Yeah, and then all my friends are like, where are the seeds?
[21:40.440 --> 21:43.440]  I'm like, you have to go online like everyone else and it feels rude.
[21:43.440 --> 21:45.440]  That was kind of our Christmas this year.
[21:45.440 --> 21:46.440]  Yeah.
[21:46.440 --> 21:47.440]  Yeah.
[21:47.440 --> 21:51.440]  Sorry, we're all going to take turns joking because the dads are going around in a circle.
[21:51.440 --> 21:52.440]  Was that your shout out?
[21:52.440 --> 21:55.440]  You concluded with the sharers, the people that share?
[21:55.440 --> 21:56.440]  Yeah.
[21:56.440 --> 21:58.440]  Your eyes are as red as your microphone.
[21:58.440 --> 22:00.440]  I'm really, really, really high.
[22:00.440 --> 22:02.440]  Everybody in this room is quite dab dab.
[22:02.440 --> 22:06.440]  We showed up here, everyone showed up right about 7.10 and it's just now 8.10.
[22:06.440 --> 22:08.440]  We took a little pre-preparing session.
[22:08.440 --> 22:10.440]  Adam, how about yourself, bro?
[22:10.440 --> 22:11.440]  You got any shout outs, thanks?
[22:11.440 --> 22:13.440]  Man, you, brother.
[22:13.440 --> 22:17.440]  I've only been here a year and I met you quickly.
[22:17.440 --> 22:21.440]  But man, without you, I wouldn't be in the scene that I'm in.
[22:21.440 --> 22:24.440]  Jesse, you fed my family, brother.
[22:24.440 --> 22:26.440]  Like straight up.
[22:26.440 --> 22:29.440]  Mike, thanks for doing the work.
[22:29.440 --> 22:31.440]  You, man.
[22:31.440 --> 22:32.440]  Next year.
[22:32.440 --> 22:33.440]  Appreciate it.
[22:33.440 --> 22:34.440]  He pointed at Spence for that one.
[22:34.440 --> 22:35.440]  Yeah, sorry.
[22:35.440 --> 22:36.440]  The microphone can't see it.
[22:36.440 --> 22:38.440]  But next year, I got your back.
[22:38.440 --> 22:39.440]  I know what you're capable of, brother.
[22:39.440 --> 22:40.440]  Thank you.
[22:40.440 --> 22:41.440]  So.
[22:41.440 --> 22:43.440]  Man, it's good to have you.
[22:43.440 --> 22:44.440]  Yeah, definitely.
[22:44.440 --> 22:45.440]  Welcome to Colorado.
[22:45.440 --> 22:46.440]  Welcome to the crew.
[22:46.440 --> 22:47.440]  Like, it's definitely.
[22:47.440 --> 22:48.440]  And right on time.
[22:48.440 --> 22:49.440]  We need to get to Southern.
[22:49.440 --> 22:51.440]  And I mean, my wife for putting up with.
[22:51.440 --> 22:52.440]  My wife?
[22:52.440 --> 22:53.440]  Yeah.
[22:53.440 --> 22:55.440]  Dude, she's struggling here.
[22:55.440 --> 22:56.440]  This is my wife.
[22:56.440 --> 22:57.440]  You know, but.
[22:57.440 --> 23:00.440]  Christy.
[23:00.440 --> 23:01.440]  What's up, Christy?
[23:01.440 --> 23:03.440]  You'll be all right.
[23:03.440 --> 23:05.440]  I'm doing everything for the fams.
[23:05.440 --> 23:07.440]  So it's it'll come around.
[23:07.440 --> 23:08.440]  It's got to be hard.
[23:08.440 --> 23:10.440]  You guys move from another state and she doesn't have anybody.
[23:10.440 --> 23:12.440]  And she's not just look at us.
[23:12.440 --> 23:13.440]  So we did it two years ago.
[23:13.440 --> 23:16.440]  Yeah, she's not a social butterfly like us.
[23:16.440 --> 23:18.440]  She's really she's kind of shyer than we are.
[23:18.440 --> 23:20.440]  So I understand why she's having a hard time.
[23:20.440 --> 23:22.440]  She can't just talk to people like we do a job and shit.
[23:22.440 --> 23:27.440]  So it's been kind of, you know, she I'm proud of her for quitting her job to tell you the truth.
[23:27.440 --> 23:28.440]  I am.
[23:28.440 --> 23:29.440]  She got up.
[23:29.440 --> 23:31.440]  She grabbed her balls and she fucking used them.
[23:31.440 --> 23:33.440]  And I've been there for four years.
[23:33.440 --> 23:35.440]  It's not like she hasn't put up with enough pizza.
[23:35.440 --> 23:36.440]  It's bullshit.
[23:36.440 --> 23:39.440]  Hey, Christy, I pick on you, bro, but I'm proud of you for quitting that job because that she was treating you like shit.
[23:39.440 --> 23:40.440]  You deserve better.
[23:40.440 --> 23:45.440]  And not only that, but like I said the other day in the in the Facebook post that she walks the kids to school every morning and snow.
[23:45.440 --> 23:47.440]  You know, she's never dealt with snow at all.
[23:47.440 --> 23:50.440]  So, you know, props to her and everything that she does.
[23:50.440 --> 23:51.440]  Yeah.
[23:51.440 --> 23:53.440]  Shout out to all the moms out there.
[23:53.440 --> 23:54.440]  Shout out to all the moms.
[23:54.440 --> 23:55.440]  What's up, mom?
[23:55.440 --> 23:56.440]  Shout out to my mom.
[23:56.440 --> 23:57.440]  Yeah.
[23:57.440 --> 23:58.440]  Everybody here.
[23:58.440 --> 23:59.440]  I got a pretty good mom.
[24:00.440 --> 24:01.440]  All right.
[24:01.440 --> 24:02.440]  I've got a big list.
[24:02.440 --> 24:05.440]  Got a big list of shout outs I want to give here.
[24:05.440 --> 24:06.440]  Thanks.
[24:06.440 --> 24:07.440]  All the people that said thanks to me.
[24:07.440 --> 24:08.440]  Thanks.
[24:08.440 --> 24:09.440]  That makes me blush.
[24:09.440 --> 24:10.440]  It makes me feel honored.
[24:10.440 --> 24:11.440]  You can't be.
[24:11.440 --> 24:16.440]  Somebody taught me that you are the sum of the five people that you surround yourself the most on purpose.
[24:16.440 --> 24:19.440]  Five people sitting at this table with me.
[24:19.440 --> 24:21.440]  So that's an honor.
[24:21.440 --> 24:22.440]  Yeah.
[24:22.440 --> 24:23.440]  Yeah.
[24:23.440 --> 24:24.440]  You know, yeah.
[24:24.440 --> 24:27.440]  So I don't remember who taught me that.
[24:27.440 --> 24:32.440]  It may have been Cliff Ravenscraft is where I heard it, but somebody else taught him.
[24:32.440 --> 24:33.440]  It might have been Michael Hyatt.
[24:33.440 --> 24:34.440]  It doesn't matter.
[24:34.440 --> 24:40.440]  But, yeah, that's the five people that you surround yourself with the most on purpose are who you become.
[24:40.440 --> 24:45.440]  And there are five people sitting around me that I'm inspired by all of you every day just a little bit.
[24:45.440 --> 24:47.440]  Maddie's looking at me like you're inspired by me?
[24:47.440 --> 24:48.440]  Fuck yeah.
[24:48.440 --> 24:49.440]  No, your friends have a big influence on you.
[24:49.440 --> 24:50.440]  So I completely understand that.
[24:50.440 --> 24:51.440]  Absolutely.
[24:51.440 --> 24:53.440]  And I completely agree with that same statement.
[24:53.440 --> 24:55.440]  I've never really thought about it like that before.
[24:55.440 --> 24:56.440]  That's why I was staring at you.
[24:56.440 --> 24:57.440]  I was like, hmm.
[24:57.440 --> 25:00.440]  I'm sitting here trying to think of my five and most of them are at this table.
[25:00.440 --> 25:03.440]  So, yeah, friends are always been my family.
[25:03.440 --> 25:05.440]  You know, that explains why I'm listening to Red Gate for the last two years.
[25:05.440 --> 25:06.440]  Yeah.
[25:06.440 --> 25:12.440]  And, of course, Angela would be if there was another person to be here that would contribute to who I have been lately.
[25:12.440 --> 25:17.440]  Angela would be if you two can't if Maddie and Spence were a person as we put that couple.
[25:17.440 --> 25:18.440]  We're just Garden of Weedon.
[25:18.440 --> 25:19.440]  Yeah.
[25:19.440 --> 25:22.440]  If they were Garden of Weedon, then Angela would probably be number five.
[25:22.440 --> 25:24.440]  She's my stuff.
[25:24.440 --> 25:28.440]  So I've got a huge, huge freaking list of shout outs that I want to give here.
[25:28.440 --> 25:33.440]  I'm looking to see how much time I'm into this episode because I don't want to take like four minutes doing shout outs, but I'm going to do prizes.
[25:33.440 --> 25:34.440]  Yeah, right.
[25:34.440 --> 25:35.440]  That's cool.
[25:35.440 --> 25:37.440]  That's probably the next part here.
[25:37.440 --> 25:39.440]  So let's see.
[25:39.440 --> 25:40.440]  I said it first.
[25:40.440 --> 25:42.440]  Angela keeps me smiling and inspired.
[25:42.440 --> 25:44.440]  Maddie, dude, you're the first woman on the show.
[25:44.440 --> 25:45.440]  That's awesome.
[25:45.440 --> 25:46.440]  Thank you.
[25:46.440 --> 25:47.440]  I'm happy.
[25:47.440 --> 25:48.440]  Thanks for coming again.
[25:48.440 --> 25:51.440]  Spence, dude, you keep me supplied with the dankest dabs I could ever imagine smoking.
[25:52.440 --> 25:55.440]  I smoke a lot of hash, you guys, and Spence keeps me going.
[25:55.440 --> 25:58.440]  He's actually in the process of teaching me how to make my own.
[25:58.440 --> 26:00.440]  Hopefully tomorrow we'll get on that again.
[26:00.440 --> 26:01.440]  Big shout out to Big Mike.
[26:01.440 --> 26:02.440]  What's up, bro?
[26:02.440 --> 26:03.440]  You're like family.
[26:03.440 --> 26:04.440]  Michael, you're like family.
[26:04.440 --> 26:05.440]  What up, Big Mike?
[26:05.440 --> 26:06.440]  White Mike sitting next to me.
[26:06.440 --> 26:07.440]  Family.
[26:07.440 --> 26:08.440]  Sloppy.
[26:08.440 --> 26:09.440]  What's up, my ninja?
[26:09.440 --> 26:10.440]  Slop Dizzle.
[26:10.440 --> 26:11.440]  Big shout out.
[26:11.440 --> 26:12.440]  Big shout out to Phil.
[26:12.440 --> 26:13.440]  Phil, we don't get to hang out enough, bro.
[26:13.440 --> 26:16.440]  You're kind of quiet, but know that I think about you that you're part of the crew over here.
[26:16.440 --> 26:17.440]  Adam, what's up, dude?
[26:17.440 --> 26:18.440]  You already know I said what's up.
[26:18.440 --> 26:20.440]  Jesse, dude, you're quiet and you're shy, but I love having you on the show, man.
[26:20.440 --> 26:21.440]  You're loosening it up.
[26:21.440 --> 26:23.440]  You're becoming a great fucking podcast guest.
[26:23.440 --> 26:24.440]  For sure.
[26:24.440 --> 26:25.440]  A hell of a dude.
[26:25.440 --> 26:27.440]  I know that if some shit goes wrong, I can always call you.
[26:27.440 --> 26:29.440]  Jesse can build a house with his hands.
[26:29.440 --> 26:31.440]  With his bare man hands.
[26:31.440 --> 26:34.440]  Yeah, so if some shit goes, I know I can count on him.
[26:34.440 --> 26:35.440]  It's sick.
[26:35.440 --> 26:36.440]  I know.
[26:36.440 --> 26:37.440]  It's the beard.
[26:37.440 --> 26:38.440]  Is it the beard that does it?
[26:38.440 --> 26:39.440]  It's the manpower.
[26:39.440 --> 26:41.440]  It's the superpower.
[26:41.440 --> 26:42.440]  King Cola, shout out, bro.
[26:42.440 --> 26:43.440]  Clint, shout out.
[26:43.440 --> 26:46.440]  Super big shout out to Hunt, Grimey Gatsby, and the Terpex crew.
[26:47.440 --> 26:49.440]  719 Nugs, big shout out there.
[26:49.440 --> 26:53.440]  Extra large shout out to Hygro, Tree Thugger, Nature's Green Remedies, Oil Slick.
[26:53.440 --> 26:58.440]  Big super warmed up to the perfect temperature shout out to Highly Educated and Task Rock.
[26:58.440 --> 26:59.440]  How about this one?
[26:59.440 --> 27:02.440]  A shout out to Robert, Craig, Vegas, Matt, and Matt from The Spot.
[27:02.440 --> 27:08.440]  Twitter listeners, Frivolous, Road Runner, Mr. Omnio, El Rocho from Facebook.
[27:08.440 --> 27:10.440]  How about Fred Garvin?
[27:10.440 --> 27:12.440]  How about my good logo designer, Bender?
[27:12.440 --> 27:13.440]  What's up, buddy?
[27:13.440 --> 27:18.440]  People that let me use their music, Cat and Coot from the Mystic Roots Band, DJ Nickatee.
[27:18.440 --> 27:19.440]  Task lets me use his music too.
[27:19.440 --> 27:20.440]  Shout out for that.
[27:20.440 --> 27:24.440]  The guy that taught me so much about podcasting and has no idea that I even have a podcast
[27:24.440 --> 27:27.440]  and has never listened to my show will not hear this shout out.
[27:27.440 --> 27:30.440]  But huge shout out to Mr. Cliff Ravenscraft, the Podcast Answer Man.
[27:30.440 --> 27:34.440]  If you guys are trying to make a podcast, dude, totally Google the Podcast Answer Man.
[27:34.440 --> 27:35.440]  Check his shit out.
[27:35.440 --> 27:37.440]  He will teach you so much.
[27:37.440 --> 27:39.440]  If you're looking for some high grade, no, wait.
[27:39.440 --> 27:42.440]  If you're looking for some mid-grade cannabis, big shout out to my friend Vigor Lover.
[27:43.440 --> 27:44.440]  Shout out.
[27:44.440 --> 27:45.440]  Hashtag mids.
[27:45.440 --> 27:47.440]  Shout out to Jake and Emily.
[27:49.440 --> 27:51.440]  Super huge shout out to Giddy Up and Emotech.
[27:51.440 --> 27:52.440]  Shout out to Hanky B.
[27:52.440 --> 27:58.440]  And a super special shout out to my good friend Doug Benson and also Joey Coco Diaz.
[27:58.440 --> 28:00.440]  And a shout out to everybody that made it here to the show.
[28:00.440 --> 28:03.440]  I was kind of wondering if you were going to forget him or not, but that's cool.
[28:03.440 --> 28:04.440]  No, cocksuck.
[28:04.440 --> 28:05.440]  I ain't going to forget Joey Diaz.
[28:08.440 --> 28:09.440]  I listened to his podcast.
[28:09.440 --> 28:10.440]  The other day was amazing.
[28:10.440 --> 28:11.440]  Joe Rogan and Diaz?
[28:12.440 --> 28:13.440]  I haven't even listened to that one.
[28:13.440 --> 28:15.440]  Doug Benson and Coco Diaz.
[28:15.440 --> 28:17.440]  Okay, I haven't seen that one.
[28:17.440 --> 28:22.440]  The little Filipino girl in between them and he's just like, oh, you're a sweet little peach there.
[28:22.440 --> 28:23.440]  The little Filipino girl?
[28:23.440 --> 28:24.440]  Who is that?
[28:24.440 --> 28:26.440]  Emily Koo or something.
[28:26.440 --> 28:27.440]  Margaret Cho?
[28:27.440 --> 28:28.440]  No, no.
[28:28.440 --> 28:29.440]  Okay, you're not Filipino.
[28:29.440 --> 28:31.440]  I'm just wondering how racist you're getting.
[28:31.440 --> 28:33.440]  You are on a show saying that to people.
[28:33.440 --> 28:34.440]  Hey, hey, hey.
[28:34.440 --> 28:35.440]  All right.
[28:35.440 --> 28:38.440]  So, man, I want to thank all the listeners.
[28:39.440 --> 28:41.440]  Super huge shout out from my heart.
[28:41.440 --> 28:43.440]  I grow from my heart and I thank you from my heart.
[28:43.440 --> 28:44.440]  Thanks for listening to 50 episodes.
[28:44.440 --> 28:47.440]  We get like 6,000 listens on a huge episode.
[28:47.440 --> 28:50.440]  When Sean comes on, we get 6,000 people that hear this.
[28:50.440 --> 28:51.440]  That's fucking insane.
[28:51.440 --> 28:52.440]  Yeah.
[28:52.440 --> 28:54.440]  I had no idea it was that high of a number.
[28:54.440 --> 28:59.440]  When you said that earlier, I was hoping you were going to mention it now because I had no idea.
[28:59.440 --> 29:01.440]  If you knew what my guess was, it was nothing close to that.
[29:01.440 --> 29:02.440]  What was your guess?
[29:02.440 --> 29:03.440]  That was awesome.
[29:03.440 --> 29:04.440]  You can tell me.
[29:04.440 --> 29:05.440]  I thought maybe like 1,500.
[29:05.440 --> 29:06.440]  That's what I was thinking.
[29:07.440 --> 29:10.440]  I don't think about the fact that it's the web.
[29:10.440 --> 29:12.440]  Anybody can listen to it.
[29:12.440 --> 29:13.440]  Anybody, anywhere.
[29:13.440 --> 29:16.440]  I sent print ads to Nature's Green Remedies.
[29:16.440 --> 29:20.440]  And so everybody that bought seeds for like three months got my ad in the mail with their seeds.
[29:20.440 --> 29:22.440]  That was very smart of you.
[29:22.440 --> 29:23.440]  And that's around the world.
[29:23.440 --> 29:29.440]  As soon as I get the new logo figured out and everything, I plan on printing up a new logo and bombing the world with new newsletter ads and stuff.
[29:29.440 --> 29:30.440]  Very nice.
[29:30.440 --> 29:31.440]  We'll drop them everywhere.
[29:31.440 --> 29:34.440]  I wonder what our craziest location listener is.
[29:34.440 --> 29:37.440]  I could probably tell you by looking at the logistics on my website.
[29:37.440 --> 29:41.440]  It tells me where I can see where everybody's IP address is.
[29:41.440 --> 29:46.440]  But the problem is that people cheat on their IP addresses because they can't be looking at certain shit where they're from.
[29:46.440 --> 29:49.440]  So they've got to go in somewhere else and then come back to your site.
[29:49.440 --> 29:56.440]  But we're listened to in like Prague and Russia and places where they don't even speak English.
[29:57.440 --> 30:04.440]  I've always pumped that.
[30:04.440 --> 30:07.440]  I've told Mike before, like, those are my listens.
[30:07.440 --> 30:08.440]  I'm glad you said that.
[30:08.440 --> 30:10.440]  Shout out to all the people on Bong TV.
[30:10.440 --> 30:14.440]  I got a nice little group that I hang out with there on Bong TV, the Stoner Army.
[30:14.440 --> 30:15.440]  It's fun.
[30:15.440 --> 30:16.440]  Doe, what up, bro?
[30:16.440 --> 30:18.440]  I know we've been arguing, but it's a friendly argument.
[30:18.440 --> 30:20.440]  Shout out to Doe, Trip.
[30:20.440 --> 30:21.440]  I can't list them all.
[30:21.440 --> 30:22.440]  I forget people.
[30:22.440 --> 30:23.440]  Deez.
[30:23.440 --> 30:24.440]  All of them.
[30:24.440 --> 30:25.440]  What's up, guys?
[30:25.440 --> 30:26.440]  Shout out to Bong TV crew.
[30:26.440 --> 30:27.440]  Does that dude with the dreadlocks?
[30:27.440 --> 30:28.440]  That's me, bro.
[30:28.440 --> 30:29.440]  No, no.
[30:29.440 --> 30:30.440]  Jen Dredd.
[30:30.440 --> 30:31.440]  Jen Dredd 420.
[30:31.440 --> 30:32.440]  The other guy.
[30:32.440 --> 30:33.440]  I think that's General Dredd.
[30:33.440 --> 30:34.440]  Oh, okay.
[30:34.440 --> 30:35.440]  I think.
[30:35.440 --> 30:36.440]  Shout out, dude, with the other dreadlocks.
[30:36.440 --> 30:37.440]  There are a couple guys on with Dredds lately.
[30:37.440 --> 30:38.440]  You know which one I'm talking about, though.
[30:38.440 --> 30:39.440]  Yeah.
[30:39.440 --> 30:40.440]  All right.
[30:40.440 --> 30:41.440]  So what I was getting at is that I love all the listeners.
[30:41.440 --> 30:46.440]  And to show that appreciation, we've got some killer prize packages and we want to give them away.
[30:46.440 --> 30:49.440]  We sat around here for a few minutes trying to think about ways to give them away.
[30:49.440 --> 30:52.440]  So I think this is what we're going to do.
[30:52.440 --> 30:57.440]  I will post pictures and I'll read the prize packs here in a minute, but I want to tell you first to keep you excited.
[30:57.440 --> 31:02.440]  I will post pictures of the prize packages on Instagram and Facebook.
[31:02.440 --> 31:06.440]  The prize packages, there won't be, there'll be individual prizes.
[31:06.440 --> 31:08.440]  The prizes that are on Facebook are only there on Facebook.
[31:08.440 --> 31:15.440]  The prizes that are on Instagram are only available on Instagram so that people that are on different social medias have options to get in on this.
[31:15.440 --> 31:19.440]  I'll post pictures on whichever side I'm posting it on.
[31:19.440 --> 31:22.440]  What you have to do is follow on Instagram.
[31:22.440 --> 31:24.440]  You have to follow, where is it?
[31:24.440 --> 31:26.440]  You have to follow IryGenetics.
[31:26.440 --> 31:31.440]  You have to follow HygroPueblo and you have to follow Garden of Weden on Instagram.
[31:31.440 --> 31:34.440]  If you want to be in the Instagram contest, you have to follow those people.
[31:34.440 --> 31:46.440]  Then you have to comment on a photo of the prize package that you want because I don't want you, if you want a T-shirt, don't like comment on the nutrient packages because there's nutrient packages and shit that I want those to go to people that are going to grow.
[31:46.440 --> 31:48.440]  If you want a nutrient package, comment on that.
[31:48.440 --> 31:49.440]  If you want a T-shirt, comment on that.
[31:49.440 --> 31:55.440]  If you want the sweet ass pendant that Maddie and Spence brought, comment on that so that we can give these prizes to people that want them.
[31:55.440 --> 32:01.440]  Comment on the prize that you want using hashtag growfromyourheartgiveaway on Instagram.
[32:01.440 --> 32:07.440]  Then comment on that picture and tell me why you think you should win that prize.
[32:07.440 --> 32:08.440]  It's pretty easy.
[32:08.440 --> 32:09.440]  You got three things to do.
[32:09.440 --> 32:11.440]  You got to follow three people.
[32:11.440 --> 32:15.440]  You got to comment using a hashtag, using hashtag growfromyourheartgiveaway.
[32:15.440 --> 32:20.440]  Then you got to put in a little message there and tell me why you think you should win that specific prize.
[32:20.440 --> 32:23.440]  You can enter once on each picture.
[32:23.440 --> 32:25.440]  That includes Facebook and Instagram.
[32:25.440 --> 32:27.440]  You can do all of the contests once.
[32:27.440 --> 32:31.440]  Don't enter, don't leave two comments on the same picture.
[32:31.440 --> 32:34.440]  I'll probably delete both of your comments at that point.
[32:34.440 --> 32:36.440]  I'm just trying to keep it fair.
[32:36.440 --> 32:39.440]  I just don't want a bunch of people spamming the shit out of my stuff.
[32:39.440 --> 32:40.440]  Follow the rules.
[32:40.440 --> 32:41.440]  Yeah.
[32:41.440 --> 32:43.440]  I make all the rules as they're going.
[32:43.440 --> 32:46.440]  I'm going to try to be as fair as possible, but I do have the right to change the rules.
[32:46.440 --> 32:49.440]  If I feel like you cheated or you're being a douche, I can just cock block you.
[32:49.440 --> 32:50.440]  That's my thing.
[32:50.440 --> 32:52.440]  I hold that heavy band hammer.
[32:52.440 --> 32:55.440]  Every single prize, I would pretty much kill for.
[32:55.440 --> 32:56.440]  They're great prizes.
[32:56.440 --> 32:58.440]  Dude, Jesse and High Grow killed it.
[32:58.440 --> 33:01.440]  When they showed up with – they brought four killer bags.
[33:01.440 --> 33:02.440]  All right.
[33:02.440 --> 33:03.440]  Let me read you what's in this bag.
[33:03.440 --> 33:05.440]  Here is the – I'll go from the bottom.
[33:05.440 --> 33:09.440]  The smaller prizes are from our good friends at Highly Educated Titanium.
[33:09.440 --> 33:12.440]  There will be one Highly Educated t-shirt.
[33:12.440 --> 33:14.440]  It's a size extra large.
[33:14.440 --> 33:23.440]  There is one iRegenetics sticker pack in there, which is a license plate sticker, a regular logo sticker, and an iHeartDab sticker.
[33:23.440 --> 33:26.440]  That's the Highly Educated prize pack.
[33:26.440 --> 33:31.440]  There are four iRegenetics t-shirts and sticker packs available.
[33:31.440 --> 33:35.440]  I'm writing down sticker pack on there because I didn't put that part on the start.
[33:35.440 --> 33:39.440]  There will be four iRegenetics t-shirts and sticker packs available.
[33:39.440 --> 33:41.440]  There's a variety of sizes.
[33:41.440 --> 33:43.440]  There are three black and one white.
[33:43.440 --> 33:46.440]  I'll list them all on social media sites.
[33:46.440 --> 33:49.440]  There will be probably two on Facebook, two on Instagram.
[33:49.440 --> 33:51.440]  We'll list those up there.
[33:51.440 --> 33:52.440]  You got four options.
[33:52.440 --> 34:01.440]  I'm going to go ahead and add there are two hat pins, two iRi hat pins, one for IG and one for Facebook.
[34:01.440 --> 34:03.440]  There's a lot of cool-ass prizes now.
[34:03.440 --> 34:05.440]  We're just going nuts.
[34:05.440 --> 34:06.440]  Getting even better.
[34:06.440 --> 34:08.440]  Yeah.
[34:08.440 --> 34:10.440]  I'm only shipping this shit to the United States, you guys.
[34:10.440 --> 34:12.440]  I'm shipping this stuff out of America.
[34:12.440 --> 34:14.440]  You got to be in the United States of America.
[34:14.440 --> 34:19.440]  If you win these prizes and you want to pay for the shipping and you're in France or wherever else out of the country,
[34:19.440 --> 34:21.440]  you can pay for the shipping and I'll mail it to you.
[34:21.440 --> 34:24.440]  But it's already going to be expensive enough.
[34:24.440 --> 34:28.440]  For that grand prize, it's going to be like $40, even if it goes to Denver.
[34:28.440 --> 34:30.440]  Yeah, that's coming out of my pocket.
[34:30.440 --> 34:33.440]  So shout-out to everybody who threw down sweet prizes.
[34:33.440 --> 34:34.440]  Shout-out to Jeff.
[34:34.440 --> 34:35.440]  I don't mind.
[34:35.440 --> 34:37.440]  Shout-out to Jeff for paying for the shipping.
[34:37.440 --> 34:40.440]  What you brought way outshines my shipping costs.
[34:40.440 --> 34:41.440]  Shout-out to Igro.
[34:41.440 --> 34:42.440]  Shout-out to Jeff.
[34:42.440 --> 34:43.440]  You guys rule.
[34:43.440 --> 34:44.440]  Garden of Whedon.
[34:44.440 --> 34:47.440]  There is a prize package from the lovely folks at Garden of Whedon.
[34:47.440 --> 34:48.440]  There's a T-shirt.
[34:48.440 --> 34:49.440]  What size was it?
[34:49.440 --> 34:50.440]  Extra large?
[34:50.440 --> 34:51.440]  Yep.
[34:51.440 --> 34:52.440]  Yep.
[34:52.440 --> 34:53.440]  Extra large T-shirt.
[34:53.440 --> 34:56.440]  There is a sticker, a Garden of Whedon sticker, and a cool-ass pendant.
[34:56.440 --> 34:57.440]  It's like a honeycomb.
[34:57.440 --> 34:59.440]  I think it's a honeycomb.
[34:59.440 --> 35:02.440]  It's made by the real ghost cat glass artist.
[35:02.440 --> 35:03.440]  And it's pretty sweet.
[35:03.440 --> 35:05.440]  I told them that I wasn't making it to the prize pack,
[35:05.440 --> 35:07.440]  and they looked at me like I was a dick and told me I had to give it away.
[35:07.440 --> 35:09.440]  So you guys are lucky again now.
[35:09.440 --> 35:10.440]  All right.
[35:10.440 --> 35:13.440]  So those are kind of the smaller prizes, which aren't even that small.
[35:13.440 --> 35:14.440]  We got T-shirts.
[35:14.440 --> 35:16.440]  We got T-shirts and sticker packs.
[35:16.440 --> 35:17.440]  We got a pendy.
[35:17.440 --> 35:19.440]  We got a sticker and a shirt.
[35:19.440 --> 35:20.440]  We got hat pins.
[35:20.440 --> 35:22.440]  So here's where we're getting fancy.
[35:22.440 --> 35:25.440]  There are three of these available.
[35:25.440 --> 35:29.440]  There are – it's a big one of those sweet tote bags like you get at all the events.
[35:29.440 --> 35:34.440]  There's a bunch of heavy 16 nutrients, like a heavy 16 nutrient pack.
[35:35.440 --> 35:36.440]  Shout out to heavy 16.
[35:36.440 --> 35:37.440]  Good shit.
[35:37.440 --> 35:39.440]  You'll grow some heavy herb with that.
[35:39.440 --> 35:41.440]  There's a bottle of plant catalyst.
[35:41.440 --> 35:42.440]  There's a bottle of taproot.
[35:42.440 --> 35:44.440]  There are some stickers.
[35:44.440 --> 35:48.440]  And then there's probably a humble hemp wick and maybe some random shit in there,
[35:48.440 --> 35:50.440]  just a little bit of swag in that bag.
[35:50.440 --> 35:51.440]  So there are three of those.
[35:51.440 --> 35:53.440]  Little Nano Lux flashlight.
[35:53.440 --> 35:55.440]  Oh, yeah, little Nano Lux, a green flashlight for your grow room.
[35:55.440 --> 35:57.440]  The green light won't bug your plants.
[35:57.440 --> 35:58.440]  Yeah.
[35:58.440 --> 36:01.440]  Those have been a favorite around the people lately.
[36:01.440 --> 36:02.440]  Around the job site.
[36:02.440 --> 36:03.440]  Yeah.
[36:03.440 --> 36:07.440]  And then the grand prize brought to us again.
[36:07.440 --> 36:10.440]  I got to mention Hydro Indoor Growing Supplies in Pueblo and Denver.
[36:10.440 --> 36:11.440]  Man.
[36:11.440 --> 36:12.440]  Check them out.
[36:12.440 --> 36:13.440]  Mention the show.
[36:13.440 --> 36:14.440]  You'll get sweet deals.
[36:14.440 --> 36:20.440]  Hydro Indoor Growing Supplies has donated a bag of Grokashi, a bag of OGT,
[36:20.440 --> 36:26.440]  a big bunch of heavy 16 nutrients, a big bottle of plant catalyst, a bottle of taproot.
[36:26.440 --> 36:28.440]  There's a lighter, some stickers.
[36:28.440 --> 36:31.440]  There's a Probiotic Farmers Alliance button.
[36:31.440 --> 36:33.440]  There's a Gage Green Genetics button.
[36:33.440 --> 36:38.440]  There's a Bronco T-shirt with some other stuff on it.
[36:38.440 --> 36:43.440]  I don't think that Bronco logo is used with proper licensing.
[36:43.440 --> 36:44.440]  It's a house and garden T-shirt.
[36:44.440 --> 36:45.440]  Okay.
[36:45.440 --> 36:46.440]  There's that shirt in there.
[36:46.440 --> 36:50.440]  And then there's probably stickers, and there's going to be other random stuff in that one.
[36:50.440 --> 36:53.440]  That is our big super number one bonus prize pack.
[36:53.440 --> 36:57.440]  That Grokashi is going to improve your grow by a whole bunch.
[36:57.440 --> 36:59.440]  That OGT is going to improve your grow a whole bunch.
[36:59.440 --> 37:03.440]  I was going to say, all of that will make you into a damn near great gardener.
[37:03.440 --> 37:04.440]  Yeah.
[37:04.440 --> 37:08.440]  All you need now is a good pack of seeds and some soil and a good light, and you'll be crushing it.
[37:08.440 --> 37:10.440]  Decent, good living soil and shit.
[37:10.440 --> 37:11.440]  Yeah.
[37:11.440 --> 37:12.440]  Yeah.
[37:12.440 --> 37:13.440]  If you do it right.
[37:13.440 --> 37:14.440]  That'll put you through the first one at least.
[37:14.440 --> 37:15.440]  Some worm casting.
[37:15.440 --> 37:17.440]  It's really nice to try some new products also.
[37:17.440 --> 37:20.440]  That'll teach you, damn, whatever I did that time, I need to do it again.
[37:20.440 --> 37:21.440]  Yeah.
[37:21.440 --> 37:25.440]  I actually got a sample pack of that heavy 16, and I will use it on something really soon.
[37:25.440 --> 37:29.440]  I've got so many projects coming up that I've started another perpetual cycle.
[37:29.440 --> 37:35.440]  Instead of doing large rooms all at once, I've got a perpetual, and that gives me more options to run different newts.
[37:35.440 --> 37:37.440]  I really like the perpetual better.
[37:37.440 --> 37:39.440]  It just keeps me going.
[37:39.440 --> 37:40.440]  Yeah.
[37:40.440 --> 37:44.440]  It keeps me, I don't know, it seems like I get stagnant when I just have a long grow.
[37:44.440 --> 37:45.440]  All right.
[37:45.440 --> 37:47.440]  Guys, get in on these prize packages.
[37:47.440 --> 37:48.440]  Here are the rules again.
[37:48.440 --> 37:54.440]  I'm going to take pictures of every prize package, and I will try to show everything that's in the package in a nice little pile.
[37:54.440 --> 37:56.440]  It's going to take me a minute to get all these up.
[37:56.440 --> 37:58.440]  I will post the pictures to Facebook.
[37:58.440 --> 38:00.440]  I will post some of the pictures to Instagram.
[38:00.440 --> 38:04.440]  What you've got to do is go and follow, oh, yeah, I didn't say who you had to follow on Facebook.
[38:04.440 --> 38:07.440]  You have to follow the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[38:07.440 --> 38:11.440]  You have to follow Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies, and you have to follow the Garden of Weden on Facebook.
[38:11.440 --> 38:12.440]  Then it's the same thing.
[38:12.440 --> 38:18.440]  You have to comment using hashtag growfromyourheart, and you have to tell me why you should win the prizes.
[38:18.440 --> 38:27.440]  I will post the pictures on the iRegenetics on Instagram, and the Grow From Your Heart podcast on Facebook is where you'll find these pictures.
[38:27.440 --> 38:29.440]  I said that right, right, everyone?
[38:29.440 --> 38:30.440]  Yeah.
[38:30.440 --> 38:31.440]  Cool.
[38:31.440 --> 38:32.440]  I'm just making sure I'm not fucking anything up.
[38:32.440 --> 38:35.440]  I just want everybody to be on the same page as me because my notes are really scattered on this page.
[38:35.440 --> 38:38.440]  I would imagine all this information will be in the post with the picture.
[38:38.440 --> 38:39.440]  Yeah, yeah.
[38:39.440 --> 38:40.440]  I'll put the rules there, too.
[38:40.440 --> 38:41.440]  Check the sizes for the shirts, folks.
[38:41.440 --> 38:43.440]  We made sure to get a selection.
[38:43.440 --> 38:44.440]  That's the kind of stuff I'm talking about.
[38:44.440 --> 38:45.440]  Some legit sizes.
[38:45.440 --> 38:47.440]  So check the photo that you're looking at.
[38:47.440 --> 38:50.440]  Don't comment on the extra small shirt when you want the extra large shirt.
[38:50.440 --> 38:51.440]  Yeah.
[38:51.440 --> 38:52.440]  The extra medium.
[38:52.440 --> 38:53.440]  The extra medium.
[38:53.440 --> 38:54.440]  It'll look good on you.
[38:54.440 --> 38:55.440]  It'll look good on you.
[38:55.440 --> 38:56.440]  That's what I saw.
[38:56.440 --> 38:57.440]  Is that what you wear?
[38:57.440 --> 38:58.440]  Medium, tall, and skinny?
[38:58.440 --> 38:59.440]  Mm-hmm.
[38:59.440 --> 39:00.440]  Yeah.
[39:00.440 --> 39:01.440]  Dude, you'd look funny in a medium.
[39:01.440 --> 39:03.440]  They'd be like a little mini halter top on you.
[39:03.440 --> 39:05.440]  Spence is like 6'4", 6'5".
[39:05.440 --> 39:07.440]  It's the curse of the tall guy.
[39:07.440 --> 39:08.440]  Yeah.
[39:08.440 --> 39:10.440]  You're also the skinny guy, so you get doubly bad.
[39:10.440 --> 39:11.440]  Yep, yep.
[39:12.440 --> 39:15.440]  I remember one time I went to, what was it, Big and Tall,
[39:15.440 --> 39:17.440]  one of those thinking I could get some just regular tall,
[39:17.440 --> 39:21.440]  but no, you got to be like size 40 and tall at the same time.
[39:21.440 --> 39:23.440]  It's like, Jesus.
[39:23.440 --> 39:24.440]  You could fit in one pant leg.
[39:24.440 --> 39:27.440]  It's big and, not big, comma.
[39:27.440 --> 39:28.440]  Yeah.
[39:28.440 --> 39:30.440]  I forgot to do a shout-out to Greenworks.
[39:30.440 --> 39:31.440]  Big shout-out to Greenworks.
[39:31.440 --> 39:33.440]  They changed the game this year a little bit for a few people.
[39:33.440 --> 39:35.440]  Yeah, shout-out to Greenworks.
[39:35.440 --> 39:40.440]  I got indoor, outdoor tree trunks growing inside.
[39:40.440 --> 39:42.440]  Yeah, I've seen the pictures.
[39:42.440 --> 39:43.440]  Check out Spence's Instagram.
[39:43.440 --> 39:44.440]  Make sure you do.
[39:44.440 --> 39:45.440]  If you're trying to win some prizes,
[39:45.440 --> 39:47.440]  you're going to have to like some stuff on Spence's Instagram.
[39:47.440 --> 39:49.440]  If you're listening to the show, these follows,
[39:49.440 --> 39:52.440]  if you aren't already, you will enjoy.
[39:52.440 --> 39:53.440]  Yeah, for sure.
[39:53.440 --> 39:54.440]  Listen to episode 50.
[39:54.440 --> 39:56.440]  I think that needs to be a rule.
[39:56.440 --> 40:01.440]  It's not applicable at this moment, but once it's on social media.
[40:01.440 --> 40:03.440]  They're definitely, if they want to know all the rules,
[40:03.440 --> 40:05.440]  they probably listen to number 50.
[40:05.440 --> 40:06.440]  Yeah, please, just listen to the podcast, guys.
[40:06.440 --> 40:07.440]  Tell your friends.
[40:07.440 --> 40:11.440]  We're definitely hitting 4,000 listens on almost every episode,
[40:11.440 --> 40:12.440]  which is pretty cool.
[40:12.440 --> 40:14.440]  The better episodes get 6,000.
[40:14.440 --> 40:16.440]  The standouts are getting 5,000 listens.
[40:16.440 --> 40:20.440]  There are some that are still like the episodes with just me, nobody listens.
[40:20.440 --> 40:22.440]  They listen to about, and I can see on the website,
[40:22.440 --> 40:26.440]  if you listen for 40 minutes of the episode or 40% of the episode,
[40:26.440 --> 40:28.440]  it shows me how far you drop out,
[40:28.440 --> 40:30.440]  and people just get tired of me rambling by myself.
[40:30.440 --> 40:32.440]  But tell your friends about the show.
[40:32.440 --> 40:36.440]  If all 5,000 of my listeners told two people about the show,
[40:36.440 --> 40:38.440]  because one person is going to ignore you and one person might listen,
[40:38.440 --> 40:41.440]  that would probably get me at least another 1,000 listeners.
[40:41.440 --> 40:43.440]  Podcasting is still kind of new.
[40:43.440 --> 40:46.440]  It's catching on very quickly, but you tell people,
[40:46.440 --> 40:48.440]  hey, man, do you listen to podcasts?
[40:48.440 --> 40:50.440]  And they're like, what's a podcast?
[40:50.440 --> 40:52.440]  Or they're like, yeah, I do, man.
[40:52.440 --> 40:53.440]  What shows are you jamming?
[40:53.440 --> 40:54.440]  They either know or they don't.
[40:54.440 --> 40:56.440]  So if you tell people, when more people listen,
[40:56.440 --> 40:59.440]  it moves my show up in the ranks in Stitcher and in iTunes,
[40:59.440 --> 41:01.440]  and then that shows, it makes it available to more people.
[41:01.440 --> 41:04.440]  They just see it, and then more people grow better cannabis.
[41:04.440 --> 41:07.440]  That's my goal, just more better, more better weed all over the world.
[41:07.440 --> 41:10.440]  Tell your dealer to listen to the show.
[41:10.440 --> 41:13.440]  Yeah, tell whoever is responsible for growing your cannabis to listen to the
[41:13.440 --> 41:16.440]  Grow From Your Heart podcast, and maybe we can get you some better weed.
[41:16.440 --> 41:17.440]  No mids.
[41:17.440 --> 41:18.440]  No mids.
[41:18.440 --> 41:22.440]  I tell people all the time, all the time about it.
[41:22.440 --> 41:25.440]  And we have kind of gotten way off topic on the past few episodes,
[41:25.440 --> 41:28.440]  because we had Christmas and New Year's, and then I was sick of shit,
[41:28.440 --> 41:30.440]  and these guys came over and did a rescue episode for me.
[41:30.440 --> 41:33.440]  I don't know if that's even out yet.
[41:33.440 --> 41:35.440]  No, that hasn't been posted as of this time,
[41:35.440 --> 41:37.440]  so I don't know how many listens that got, but it was a great episode.
[41:37.440 --> 41:38.440]  It was funny.
[41:38.440 --> 41:39.440]  The last episode.
[41:39.440 --> 41:41.440]  Stoners that are ahead of schedule.
[41:41.440 --> 41:42.440]  Yeah.
[41:42.440 --> 41:43.440]  Yeah.
[41:43.440 --> 41:46.440]  But we are going to get back onto the track of doing those great episodes
[41:46.440 --> 41:49.440]  where there's a lot of grow lessons and a lot of great guests.
[41:49.440 --> 41:50.440]  You guys are going to learn more shit.
[41:50.440 --> 41:52.440]  It's not just going to be my high-ass rambling.
[41:52.440 --> 41:55.440]  I've actually got the next like 10 episodes kind of outlined.
[41:55.440 --> 41:57.440]  I know what the topics are going to be.
[41:57.440 --> 41:59.440]  I could scroll through my phone and read off points, but I'm not going to do it.
[41:59.440 --> 42:02.440]  Learning is what 2015 is all about.
[42:03.440 --> 42:05.440]  Remember that Adam said that.
[42:05.440 --> 42:06.440]  That was not my motto at all.
[42:08.440 --> 42:10.440]  So y'all going to learn from Adam.
[42:10.440 --> 42:11.440]  Yeah.
[42:11.440 --> 42:12.440]  Not from me.
[42:12.440 --> 42:13.440]  44.
[42:13.440 --> 42:14.440]  44.
[42:14.440 --> 42:15.440]  Get in on those contests, guys.
[42:15.440 --> 42:16.440]  Man.
[42:16.440 --> 42:17.440]  Get in on it.
[42:17.440 --> 42:18.440]  I could.
[42:18.440 --> 42:19.440]  I would, but unfortunately.
[42:19.440 --> 42:21.440]  It's one of the smaller prizes, but it's so dope.
[42:21.440 --> 42:23.440]  Is that for me, Miss Maddie?
[42:23.440 --> 42:24.440]  Miss Maddie just scooped me up.
[42:24.440 --> 42:26.440]  Wait, what screen did you just give me?
[42:26.440 --> 42:27.440]  Yeti OG.
[42:27.440 --> 42:28.440]  Hey.
[42:29.440 --> 42:32.440]  You are close to that mic.
[42:32.440 --> 42:33.440]  All right.
[42:33.440 --> 42:35.440]  Somebody's got to talk while I take a dab.
[42:35.440 --> 42:36.440]  Yeah, go for it, Adam.
[42:36.440 --> 42:37.440]  You always have a good start.
[42:37.440 --> 42:38.440]  Yeah, have a good ramble.
[42:38.440 --> 42:44.440]  Well, we learned today that getting hit in the face with the ball pisses people off.
[42:46.440 --> 42:47.440]  Shout out to Fish.
[42:47.440 --> 42:49.440]  You know, he's doing it.
[42:50.440 --> 42:52.440]  You'll survive, buddy.
[42:52.440 --> 42:53.440]  Yeah, yeah.
[42:53.440 --> 42:54.440]  Even if it's a total accident.
[42:54.440 --> 42:57.440]  He really wanted to come tonight, but he couldn't.
[42:58.440 --> 42:59.440]  I'm sorry, bro.
[42:59.440 --> 43:00.440]  The table is really full.
[43:00.440 --> 43:01.440]  It's crowded.
[43:01.440 --> 43:02.440]  Seats take.
[43:02.440 --> 43:04.440]  It's not us being a dick.
[43:04.440 --> 43:07.440]  There's literally, you'd have to sit in our lap.
[43:07.440 --> 43:08.440]  Mike and Jesse are kind of cuddling.
[43:08.440 --> 43:10.440]  Mike and Jesse are pretty damn close to each other.
[43:10.440 --> 43:12.440]  Just to make room for us.
[43:12.440 --> 43:13.440]  I don't have any more microphones.
[43:13.440 --> 43:14.440]  You're here in thought.
[43:16.440 --> 43:19.440]  The third time I hit him in the face with the ball was totally an accident.
[43:19.440 --> 43:25.440]  It was clearly an accident, and it was clearly the straw that broke.
[43:26.440 --> 43:38.440]  But I think taking out of that job site as fast as you can with all wheels spinning towards that very, very thin and steel frame to gate is just going to be something we all do at least twice.
[43:38.440 --> 43:39.440]  I've done it several times.
[43:39.440 --> 43:41.440]  It sounds like you guys have fun at work.
[43:41.440 --> 43:42.440]  We do.
[43:43.440 --> 43:45.440]  Zero fun is allowed at work.
[43:45.440 --> 43:47.440]  Looks like you're breaking rules.
[43:47.440 --> 43:48.440]  Yeah.
[43:48.440 --> 43:54.440]  When a bunch of males of the same age are left to just stand around for 15 to 20 minutes somewhere.
[43:54.440 --> 43:56.440]  Sounds like a National Geographic description.
[43:56.440 --> 43:57.440]  Bizarre shit happens.
[43:57.440 --> 43:59.440]  That dab just made my face kind of.
[43:59.440 --> 44:01.440]  Today it was t-ball that do weird shit.
[44:01.440 --> 44:02.440]  Yeah.
[44:02.440 --> 44:03.440]  Like made my eyes get t-ball.
[44:03.440 --> 44:05.440]  Led to some major injuries and property damage.
[44:05.440 --> 44:06.440]  Sorry.
[44:06.440 --> 44:07.440]  Sorry.
[44:08.440 --> 44:09.440]  Softball.
[44:09.440 --> 44:10.440]  So good.
[44:10.440 --> 44:11.440]  All right.
[44:11.440 --> 44:14.440]  That was the kind of fun of today.
[44:14.440 --> 44:17.440]  I've been made fun of a couple times, but I can't even remember.
[44:17.440 --> 44:18.440]  Who, you?
[44:18.440 --> 44:19.440]  Yeah.
[44:19.440 --> 44:20.440]  They make fun of you at work?
[44:20.440 --> 44:22.440]  This is where you want to be when Jesus comes back.
[44:22.440 --> 44:23.440]  It's funny.
[44:23.440 --> 44:24.440]  These guys didn't work together until recently.
[44:24.440 --> 44:29.440]  I think it's partly my fault that these guys all kind of built a construction company together on accident.
[44:29.440 --> 44:35.440]  And it's fun to see all my bros just hanging out talking about what they did because before they were all off doing their own separate shit.
[44:35.440 --> 44:37.440]  And now they all have a good story together.
[44:37.440 --> 44:38.440]  Now we all mingle pretty much.
[44:38.440 --> 44:39.440]  So yeah.
[44:39.440 --> 44:41.440]  Makes for interesting conversations sometimes.
[44:41.440 --> 44:42.440]  Right.
[44:42.440 --> 44:45.440]  So Adam said that 2015 is the year of learning.
[44:45.440 --> 44:48.440]  Does anybody else have something that 2015 is for them?
[44:48.440 --> 44:49.440]  The year of what?
[44:49.440 --> 44:52.440]  Cashing in, hopefully.
[44:52.440 --> 44:53.440]  Cashing in.
[44:53.440 --> 44:54.440]  I knew that answer.
[44:54.440 --> 44:55.440]  I knew that answer.
[44:55.440 --> 44:58.440]  I'd like some of my really hard work to pay off, and it will.
[44:58.440 --> 44:59.440]  It will.
[44:59.440 --> 45:00.440]  For sure.
[45:00.440 --> 45:01.440]  Yeah.
[45:01.440 --> 45:02.440]  Right.
[45:02.440 --> 45:05.440]  I was thinking the 2014 is the year of getting the construction and the foundation in.
[45:05.440 --> 45:10.440]  2015 is actually seeing some shit succeed and get finished.
[45:10.440 --> 45:11.440]  Sounds nice.
[45:11.440 --> 45:13.440]  I finally got hired on at a large facility.
[45:13.440 --> 45:16.440]  So I've got over 200 lights to work with now.
[45:16.440 --> 45:18.440]  That's kind of what my year is going to be about.
[45:18.440 --> 45:20.440]  You're going to have fun with that, buddy.
[45:20.440 --> 45:21.440]  Blowing it up, bro.
[45:21.440 --> 45:22.440]  Blowing it up.
[45:22.440 --> 45:23.440]  Get more shirts made.
[45:23.440 --> 45:24.440]  Get them on the shelves at the spot.
[45:24.440 --> 45:25.440]  Get more hoodies made.
[45:25.440 --> 45:27.440]  Get them on the shelves at the spot.
[45:27.440 --> 45:28.440]  Some hats.
[45:28.440 --> 45:32.440]  Dude, I'm glad you said it because, Robert, if you're listening to this episode, bro, some hats are necessary.
[45:32.440 --> 45:35.440]  We need spot hats and we need Irie Genetics grassroots hats.
[45:35.440 --> 45:37.440]  Might as well call grassroots right there.
[45:37.440 --> 45:39.440]  I will prepay for my hat.
[45:39.440 --> 45:40.440]  I'm saying it right now.
[45:40.440 --> 45:41.440]  I'm a poor motherfucker.
[45:42.440 --> 45:45.440]  I will give you $40 out of money I don't have to prepay for my hat.
[45:45.440 --> 45:46.440]  Grassroots Colorado.
[45:46.440 --> 45:47.440]  Grassroots California.
[45:47.440 --> 45:48.440]  Ruga.
[45:48.440 --> 45:50.440]  Ryan, if you're listening to this show, brother, I would love a sponsorship.
[45:50.440 --> 45:54.440]  I'll do ads for a year in exchange for Irie Genetics hats.
[45:54.440 --> 45:57.440]  We've got an audience of 5,000 listeners.
[45:57.440 --> 45:59.440]  Weekly episodes.
[45:59.440 --> 46:00.440]  That's a lot.
[46:00.440 --> 46:04.440]  That's 52 episodes a year at least with 5,000 people hearing your ads.
[46:04.440 --> 46:07.440]  This podcast is brought to you by our good friends at Grassroots California.
[46:07.440 --> 46:10.440]  If you're looking for a dope-ass hat, look no further.
[46:10.440 --> 46:14.440]  Stop in at something something Larimer in Denver and pick yourself up a badass grassroots hat.
[46:14.440 --> 46:15.440]  I don't know.
[46:15.440 --> 46:16.440]  It's 22.
[46:16.440 --> 46:17.440]  Sample.
[46:17.440 --> 46:18.440]  He already knows the address.
[46:18.440 --> 46:19.440]  I got a grassroots hat on right now.
[46:19.440 --> 46:21.440]  There's a lot of you.
[46:21.440 --> 46:22.440]  There's a lot of hats at the table.
[46:22.440 --> 46:24.440]  I got about 10 more on the shelf downstairs.
[46:24.440 --> 46:27.440]  Shout out to my friend Ashley who handmade my hat.
[46:27.440 --> 46:28.440]  Fuck y'all.
[46:28.440 --> 46:29.440]  He did.
[46:29.440 --> 46:30.440]  Yeah.
[46:32.440 --> 46:36.440]  I just can't decide which grassroots hat I like the most, so I just keep buying the new fresh one that I see.
[46:37.440 --> 46:39.440]  Yeah, Maddie's got a dope genetics one yet.
[46:39.440 --> 46:40.440]  That's not yet.
[46:40.440 --> 46:43.440]  Check out Maddie's purple forever flowering grassroots hat.
[46:43.440 --> 46:44.440]  That is fresh, dude.
[46:44.440 --> 46:46.440]  That purple is purple and baby blue.
[46:46.440 --> 46:47.440]  I like that.
[46:47.440 --> 46:48.440]  I like that.
[46:48.440 --> 46:49.440]  It's got the Irie genetics hat pin.
[46:49.440 --> 46:51.440]  It's got an Irie hat pin on there to make it official.
[46:51.440 --> 46:53.440]  I think I got an Irie hat pin on here.
[46:53.440 --> 46:58.440]  No, most of my hats have it, but this one's already got the Colorado flag on there enough, so I don't put that on there.
[46:58.440 --> 47:00.440]  Lightdepth.com.
[47:00.440 --> 47:02.440]  That's one of the coolest websites I've ever heard of.
[47:02.440 --> 47:03.440]  Yeah, shout out to them.
[47:04.440 --> 47:07.440]  They don't even pay for that, but shout out to Forever Flowering Greenhouses.
[47:09.440 --> 47:11.440]  Dude, if you're poor and broke, don't even try.
[47:13.440 --> 47:14.440]  We're not trying.
[47:14.440 --> 47:15.440]  I don't have one on, folks.
[47:15.440 --> 47:21.440]  If you've got an advanced grow and you're looking for a nice outdoor greenhouse, Forever Flowering Greenhouses is the way to go.
[47:21.440 --> 47:24.440]  If you can, yeah, that'll take your shit to the next level.
[47:24.440 --> 47:26.440]  I'm trying to sell one for you guys.
[47:26.440 --> 47:27.440]  Get at me.
[47:27.440 --> 47:31.440]  You go on vacation and put plants in your hat bag and have killer plants.
[47:31.440 --> 47:32.440]  I'm doing it for my efforts.
[47:32.440 --> 47:35.440]  Name your company so we can start shouting it out.
[47:35.440 --> 47:37.440]  Yeah, big shout out to Jesse's Grow.
[47:40.440 --> 47:41.440]  What's up, Grimey Gatsby?
[47:41.440 --> 47:42.440]  I'll build that shit for you.
[47:42.440 --> 47:43.440]  I saw those pictures.
[47:43.440 --> 47:45.440]  Yeah, shout out to Hunt.
[47:45.440 --> 47:47.440]  Dude, we're going to get Hunt and Gatsby on the show.
[47:47.440 --> 47:51.440]  Me and Gatsby have relayed messages five or six times.
[47:51.440 --> 47:53.440]  Hunt, it's your turn to come see me, bro.
[47:53.440 --> 47:54.440]  No doubt.
[47:54.440 --> 47:55.440]  I've never said that.
[47:55.440 --> 47:56.440]  Come to the Pribes.
[47:56.440 --> 47:57.440]  Come to the Pribes.
[47:57.440 --> 47:58.440]  We'll do a podcast.
[47:58.440 --> 48:00.440]  We'll get Gargantu.
[48:01.440 --> 48:03.440]  Turpex and the Hunt on the show all at once.
[48:03.440 --> 48:04.440]  It'll be awesome.
[48:04.440 --> 48:05.440]  Come straight to us and we'll protect you.
[48:05.440 --> 48:07.440]  Yeah, come on down, bro.
[48:07.440 --> 48:08.440]  Hunt can take care of himself.
[48:08.440 --> 48:10.440]  He ain't worried about shit.
[48:10.440 --> 48:11.440]  Come to Pueblo.
[48:11.440 --> 48:12.440]  It ain't that bad.
[48:13.440 --> 48:15.440]  It is a dangerous city in Colorado, though.
[48:16.440 --> 48:17.440]  Isn't that funny, though?
[48:17.440 --> 48:20.440]  I live here with my kids every day.
[48:20.440 --> 48:22.440]  I haven't seen a damn bit of it.
[48:22.440 --> 48:23.440]  I'm sorry.
[48:23.440 --> 48:24.440]  I actually kind of love this place.
[48:24.440 --> 48:25.440]  People are like, why do you still live there?
[48:25.440 --> 48:29.440]  And I'm like, dude, I didn't grow up here, but I became who I am here.
[48:29.440 --> 48:32.440]  I feel like I kind of owe it to this town to stay here and be who I am
[48:32.440 --> 48:34.440]  and support the movement here and be part of this scene here.
[48:34.440 --> 48:36.440]  How many times have we defended it in Denver?
[48:36.440 --> 48:37.440]  Yeah.
[48:37.440 --> 48:38.440]  Yeah.
[48:38.440 --> 48:41.440]  And then we beat the shit out of the people that were talking shit about Pueblo.
[48:41.440 --> 48:42.440]  We fucking stabbed them with switchblades.
[48:42.440 --> 48:43.440]  Took all their money.
[48:43.440 --> 48:44.440]  And their Nikes.
[48:44.440 --> 48:45.440]  I'm just kidding.
[48:46.440 --> 48:48.440]  Probably one of the least violent people I know.
[48:49.440 --> 48:50.440]  All right.
[48:51.440 --> 48:52.440]  We have gone almost 50 minutes.
[48:52.440 --> 48:54.440]  We should put about another 10 minutes into this show.
[48:54.440 --> 48:56.440]  Anybody got anything smart ass or great to say?
[48:57.440 --> 49:00.440]  What are some of your favorite moments we've had on this podcast so far?
[49:00.440 --> 49:02.440]  I know, remember that night we sat here, we talked about it earlier.
[49:02.440 --> 49:06.440]  We sat here, you sat across the table from me, and we tried to do a show for like three hours.
[49:06.440 --> 49:12.440]  And I don't know if it was the dabs or if it was just the unfocusedness of the group.
[49:13.440 --> 49:14.440]  But yeah.
[49:14.440 --> 49:16.440]  There was no podcast to be had that night.
[49:16.440 --> 49:19.440]  You know, like in the middle of the podcast, he just walks up in the room,
[49:19.440 --> 49:22.440]  starts yelling and screaming, and it was weird.
[49:23.440 --> 49:25.440]  It didn't really happen, but it kind of really did happen.
[49:25.440 --> 49:26.440]  It kind of happened.
[49:26.440 --> 49:28.440]  But that was definitely a funny moment.
[49:28.440 --> 49:29.440]  That was funny.
[49:29.440 --> 49:34.440]  I had a recording error to where I didn't delete one of the pre-recorded tracks from another recording session.
[49:34.440 --> 49:37.440]  And when it came around to that, that recording dropped into while we were talking.
[49:37.440 --> 49:38.440]  And it was perfect.
[49:38.440 --> 49:39.440]  It was perfect.
[49:39.440 --> 49:40.440]  It was like, because the guy goes, hey, it's me, man.
[49:40.440 --> 49:41.440]  What's going on?
[49:41.440 --> 49:42.440]  And just starts talking.
[49:43.440 --> 49:45.440]  And we're like, but you're not even in the room.
[49:45.440 --> 49:46.440]  How the hell did you just do that?
[49:47.440 --> 49:49.440]  Jeff was a ventriloquist at that point in time.
[49:49.440 --> 49:51.440]  And I was like, wow, this is getting really weird.
[49:51.440 --> 49:52.440]  It was really weird, yeah.
[49:53.440 --> 49:54.440]  3 a.m. I think I need to go home, man.
[49:55.440 --> 49:56.440]  That's like some 4-track shit.
[49:57.440 --> 50:01.440]  A moment that I really, really remember is when I ate the 350-milligram edible on the podcast.
[50:02.440 --> 50:03.440]  I remember.
[50:03.440 --> 50:07.440]  I don't remember the whole hour show, but I can remember doing it.
[50:07.440 --> 50:10.440]  I sat here holding onto my chair, just tapping my feet as hard as I could.
[50:11.440 --> 50:13.440]  Woo, I'm flying right now.
[50:13.440 --> 50:14.440]  Those things.
[50:14.440 --> 50:17.440]  Those things you do not want to come to Colorado and eat, okay?
[50:17.440 --> 50:18.440]  Maybe that's what Ralphie had.
[50:18.440 --> 50:19.440]  Ralphie.
[50:19.440 --> 50:23.440]  Yeah, it may be a brownie, but that's 350 milligrams of sit the fuck down.
[50:23.440 --> 50:24.440]  Read the damn label.
[50:25.440 --> 50:27.440]  Yeah, if you guys come to Colorado and eat edibles, be careful, please.
[50:28.440 --> 50:30.440]  Luckily, that's a medical only, but you know.
[50:30.440 --> 50:33.440]  Yeah, I think they can only sell 100-gram edibles at the rec site now.
[50:33.440 --> 50:34.440]  That's the rule.
[50:34.440 --> 50:35.440]  But I mean, you know what Incredibles are?
[50:36.440 --> 50:37.440]  Yeah, they're 100.
[50:37.440 --> 50:39.440]  So, I mean, you could buy like seven of them.
[50:39.440 --> 50:40.440]  It's still Marine Dowd.
[50:40.440 --> 50:41.440]  70 of them, I don't remember.
[50:42.440 --> 50:43.440]  Yeah.
[50:43.440 --> 50:46.440]  Like, it's read the fucking label.
[50:47.440 --> 50:50.440]  Like, that was the big lesson of 2014.
[50:50.440 --> 50:52.440]  It's what happens if you legalize wheat?
[50:52.440 --> 50:55.440]  Oh, as it turns out, people don't read labels for fucking anything ever.
[50:56.440 --> 50:57.440]  We just assume and run with it.
[50:57.440 --> 50:58.440]  People that don't even take pot.
[50:58.440 --> 50:59.440]  Like, they don't even smoke.
[50:59.440 --> 51:02.440]  Well, no, if you think about it, do y'all remember the chips that gave you anal leakage?
[51:02.440 --> 51:05.440]  Like, they were looking for fat-free and it made your asshole drip?
[51:05.440 --> 51:06.440]  I wouldn't run for that one.
[51:06.440 --> 51:07.440]  That had to be on the front of the bag.
[51:08.440 --> 51:09.440]  And they still sold everywhere.
[51:09.440 --> 51:11.440]  And it's because people don't read labels.
[51:11.440 --> 51:17.440]  And with edibles, that leaves you to hugging a pair of weird jeans in a hotel room
[51:17.440 --> 51:19.440]  and then writing about it for the New York Times.
[51:19.440 --> 51:21.440]  Or Ralphie May trying not to shit himself on stage.
[51:22.440 --> 51:24.440]  You know the meme with the little black kid that always says,
[51:24.440 --> 51:27.440]  you mean to tell me that blah, blah, blah and blah, blah, blah?
[51:27.440 --> 51:30.440]  But you mean to tell me there was some fucking chips that caused anal leakage
[51:30.440 --> 51:32.440]  and people were still buying it?
[51:32.440 --> 51:33.440]  Yeah.
[51:33.440 --> 51:36.440]  I forgot that y'all were probably on two fish tour when this hit the shelves.
[51:36.440 --> 51:38.440]  Because those timelines line up.
[51:38.440 --> 51:41.440]  But O'Lestra, I think, was the special oil.
[51:41.440 --> 51:45.440]  They found a special oil and you could eat chips that you didn't get any calories from.
[51:45.440 --> 51:48.440]  But, your butt was leaking.
[51:48.440 --> 51:52.440]  Yeah, all that fat your body didn't absorb was dripping out your ass.
[51:52.440 --> 51:53.440]  So, no.
[51:53.440 --> 51:54.440]  I'll pass. I will pass.
[51:54.440 --> 51:56.440]  America was all about it.
[51:56.440 --> 51:58.440]  I don't need a snack, I have to eat on the toilet.
[51:58.440 --> 52:03.440]  Jesse's a fellow, to eat anything at the gas station kid, you know what the fuck's up.
[52:03.440 --> 52:05.440]  No, I remember making fun of my cousin for eating those.
[52:05.440 --> 52:06.440]  Yeah.
[52:06.440 --> 52:08.440]  I remember reading the package.
[52:08.440 --> 52:10.440]  It's right on the front of the bag.
[52:10.440 --> 52:15.440]  It said anal on the front of the bag of chips and they still sold all over the country.
[52:15.440 --> 52:18.440]  This is definitely a record time for the word anal being said.
[52:18.440 --> 52:23.440]  So, when it says 350 milligrams, people just don't even see it.
[52:23.440 --> 52:28.440]  They think 350 milligrams, that seems like a lot for a fun-sized Snickers edible.
[52:28.440 --> 52:32.440]  They chew that shit back and 20 minutes later they think they're in space.
[52:32.440 --> 52:37.440]  They're really just sitting in the hot tub of their hotel room just splashing in three inches of water.
[52:37.440 --> 52:39.440]  35 to 45 minutes isn't enough time.
[52:39.440 --> 52:42.440]  Seriously, give it two or three hours.
[52:42.440 --> 52:44.440]  Give it some time to kick in.
[52:44.440 --> 52:48.440]  It's got to be broken down and processed into your blood and it takes a while.
[52:48.440 --> 52:51.440]  Bad Ralphie. Bad Ralphie.
[52:51.440 --> 52:53.440]  Every person is different.
[52:53.440 --> 52:56.440]  Hey Spencer, are you going to enter any contests in 2015?
[52:57.440 --> 53:00.440]  Hopefully. I'd like to.
[53:00.440 --> 53:06.440]  I'd like to travel to Oregon and Seattle again this year and go enter up there.
[53:06.440 --> 53:09.440]  Maybe California.
[53:09.440 --> 53:11.440]  Like High Times Cannabis Cups?
[53:11.440 --> 53:13.440]  Hopefully Cannabis Cups.
[53:13.440 --> 53:14.440]  Emerald Cup.
[53:14.440 --> 53:18.440]  Maybe, what next? When is that? Next November again or something like that?
[53:18.440 --> 53:19.440]  Yeah, I think so.
[53:19.440 --> 53:22.440]  Maybe some. I'd like to get out and kind of...
[53:22.440 --> 53:27.440]  The best thing about going to cups is it's like vacation but there's weed.
[53:27.440 --> 53:28.440]  Yeah, yeah.
[53:28.440 --> 53:34.440]  You know what I'm saying? You don't have to worry about trying to find weed because you're going to a weed event so it's there.
[53:34.440 --> 53:37.440]  You guys got your Denver Cannabis Cup tickets yet?
[53:37.440 --> 53:41.440]  Don't know what we're doing yet so I don't know if I want to buy tickets or go through the vending route.
[53:41.440 --> 53:46.440]  Oh yeah, okay. I got my three day pass. I'm just working on booking a hotel room.
[53:46.440 --> 53:50.440]  I've actually got a ticket to see Doug Benson on 420 at 9 o'clock.
[53:50.440 --> 53:51.440]  Book a house.
[53:51.440 --> 53:57.440]  I just roll solo and do the backpack thing. It's so much easier. Get in the car and leave when I want. Go where I want.
[53:57.440 --> 54:00.440]  Just going to be me doing the backpack and the car. Yeah.
[54:00.440 --> 54:01.440]  Alright.
[54:01.440 --> 54:03.440]  As soon as I get extra money.
[54:03.440 --> 54:08.440]  I've gone with a crew of people and I've gone by myself and it's easier for me to just go and meet people.
[54:08.440 --> 54:11.440]  Honestly, I like going with a crew but I like to...
[54:11.440 --> 54:18.440]  Especially me when I'm trying to talk to people. It's kind of hard having 15 people when you're trying to all go talk to kids.
[54:18.440 --> 54:24.440]  You guys get tired of hanging out with me at the Cannabis Cup because I'm not even trying to be egotistical but people walk up and want to talk to me.
[54:24.440 --> 54:28.440]  They know who I am. So if you're hanging out with me, you're just hanging out by yourself pretty much.
[54:28.440 --> 54:31.440]  So I roll solo. Just go by myself.
[54:31.440 --> 54:33.440]  It's easy. You can do a lot of shit by yourself.
[54:33.440 --> 54:37.440]  Yeah. I don't have to say, hey Mike, do you want to do this? Are you hungry Mike?
[54:37.440 --> 54:40.440]  These events are so crowded and so well attended.
[54:40.440 --> 54:46.440]  I'm just trying to picture one of you walking with like 15, I mean I'm going to call them ducklings.
[54:46.440 --> 54:49.440]  It's not intended as insulting as that sounds I guess.
[54:49.440 --> 54:56.440]  Trying to walk down the aisle like that. You got to lose all your ducklings and you end up at the end of the road going, well fuck them, I got business to do.
[54:56.440 --> 54:57.440]  Yeah, pretty much.
[54:57.440 --> 55:00.440]  That's the big thing for me this year is business. I'm trying to take care of business.
[55:00.440 --> 55:06.440]  No more playing games and being nice and none of that. I'm trying to come out and take some cake.
[55:06.440 --> 55:12.440]  There you go. I'll be trying to talk to somebody like hanging out with Mila and then the people with me don't even know who Mila is.
[55:12.440 --> 55:13.440]  They have no clue who she is.
[55:13.440 --> 55:17.440]  I'm like, do you know who that was? No, I'm fucking bored. Like dude, you should have got in on that conversation.
[55:17.440 --> 55:18.440]  You should have said hello.
[55:18.440 --> 55:21.440]  Yeah, you should have got your picture taken. You should have gave her a hug.
[55:21.440 --> 55:23.440]  Give her some oil or something.
[55:23.440 --> 55:28.440]  Yeah, yeah. I pretty much learned quickly that when you're excited, I should be excited.
[55:28.440 --> 55:34.440]  When you take me places, when you're pumped, that yeah, there's something I should be paying attention to.
[55:34.440 --> 55:37.440]  And even if I don't understand right now, it'll probably be explained later.
[55:37.440 --> 55:42.440]  With this guy, even lunch can be a mild adventure where famous people just appear.
[55:42.440 --> 55:45.440]  Yeah, you just got to accept it. It's bizarre.
[55:45.440 --> 55:53.440]  You just got to know how to put yourself in the position and line yourself up to meet the people you want to meet without being creepy and realize they're just fucking people, too.
[55:53.440 --> 55:55.440]  And if they open with the right lines, they're just humans, too.
[55:55.440 --> 55:57.440]  And they realize that you're not a stalker.
[55:57.440 --> 56:00.440]  Absolutely. I do. I am nobody perfect.
[56:00.440 --> 56:06.440]  And I'm sure I'm not everybody's cup of tea, but I kind of got a nice dude that tells the truth most of the time.
[56:06.440 --> 56:12.440]  I felt giddy when DNA Genetics walked up to me and shook my hand because they recognized me and my logo from Instagram.
[56:12.440 --> 56:15.440]  They're like, hey, I know who you are, man. And they said, what's up to me and gave me props for my work.
[56:15.440 --> 56:19.440]  That kind of put a smile on my face. I got a hot nail. Somebody talk while I dab.
[56:19.440 --> 56:25.440]  I mean, you got a great email set up for him from him, you know, and shout out for that.
[56:25.440 --> 56:29.440]  We use that thing every day. We used it right before the show.
[56:30.440 --> 56:33.440]  Shout out to the G now. I thought that earlier and then I forgot.
[56:33.440 --> 56:36.440]  Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. Shout out to you.
[56:36.440 --> 56:39.440]  But yeah, the G now is a beautiful invention.
[56:39.440 --> 56:42.440]  These tabs are available that are on the table. Anybody can dab out of that.
[56:42.440 --> 56:45.440]  I'm not trying to be stash, but just send it around again.
[56:45.440 --> 56:48.440]  Yeah, go for it. Matt, you'll start helping out, too.
[56:48.440 --> 56:51.440]  All right. Big shout out to dabs. Yeah.
[56:51.440 --> 56:54.440]  Without jabs.
[56:54.440 --> 56:58.440]  A lot of those early podcasts might not have been put together.
[56:58.440 --> 57:01.440]  Yeah, don't tell everybody those happen to like sunrise and shit.
[57:01.440 --> 57:04.440]  Half asleep trying to do a podcast.
[57:04.440 --> 57:06.440]  Half asleep.
[57:06.440 --> 57:09.440]  I'm so much more comfortable on a mic now. I just swing the mic in front of me.
[57:09.440 --> 57:12.440]  I don't even edit the shows anymore. I'm just like, what's up, podcast time.
[57:12.440 --> 57:17.440]  I feel better putting some of me into the show instead of just being all information.
[57:17.440 --> 57:23.440]  I feel like I've made a lot of friends now. And from listening to I listened to the Nerdist and I listened to Doug Benson.
[57:23.440 --> 57:27.440]  And now when I see those guys like I saw Nerdist, Chris Hardwick at Red Rocks,
[57:27.440 --> 57:29.440]  and was like watching one of my friends achieve a goal.
[57:29.440 --> 57:32.440]  So I feel like maybe my listeners feel like I'm one of their buddies,
[57:32.440 --> 57:35.440]  especially the people that interact with me on Twitter and shit.
[57:35.440 --> 57:39.440]  I know I'm their friends. Like if I met Mr. Omnio, he lives in the UK.
[57:39.440 --> 57:43.440]  If he showed up, he'd bring the doorbell. He'd come in to take dabs and hang out.
[57:43.440 --> 57:46.440]  I'd make a cup of yerba mate and we'd chill out and he'd be my bro.
[57:46.440 --> 57:50.440]  And just because I have a podcast. So that guy's my friend now from that.
[57:50.440 --> 57:53.440]  Fred Garvin would probably show up and come take dabs.
[57:53.440 --> 57:56.440]  We just killed Mike with the dab. There he goes.
[57:56.440 --> 57:57.440]  Shout out to Mike.
[57:57.440 --> 58:02.440]  I'd really like for you to get Addison.
[58:02.440 --> 58:05.440]  Who was on show number two.
[58:05.440 --> 58:08.440]  Addison DeMora? Get him back.
[58:08.440 --> 58:10.440]  You've been asking and asking and asking.
[58:10.440 --> 58:12.440]  Big shout out to Addison. I should have given a shout out to that guy.
[58:12.440 --> 58:17.440]  He's been on the show. Addison, Big D, Hunt, all the Denver crew, Nickity.
[58:17.440 --> 58:22.440]  Shout out, shout out. Oh don't do that. That would be the most horrific thing ever.
[58:22.440 --> 58:24.440]  I know he's been beating you up with the microphone.
[58:24.440 --> 58:28.440]  Natty's about to blast Spence's Natty beard slash dreadlock mess.
[58:28.440 --> 58:32.440]  Torch to the dome. Torch to the dome.
[58:32.440 --> 58:35.440]  Somebody should, hold on, I'm going to yell at you guys so it would be cool.
[58:35.440 --> 58:40.440]  Hey Mike, are you alive? Mike is alive you guys. We did not kill him.
[58:40.440 --> 58:43.440]  Very borderline. But he made it.
[58:43.440 --> 58:45.440]  Alright, does anybody else have anything to say? We're down to two minutes.
[58:45.440 --> 58:48.440]  I'm going to, or we're down to a minute. Try to keep this about an hour.
[58:48.440 --> 58:50.440]  Do your stuff. Do your stuff.
[58:50.440 --> 58:53.440]  Alive and well people. Nice, we did not kill Mike.
[58:53.440 --> 58:58.440]  Dude, I've said it a couple times, but I sincerely want to thank all you guys for coming to the show.
[58:58.440 --> 59:03.440]  You guys are, Adam's made jokes about A team and B team and shit, but this is my crew right here.
[59:03.440 --> 59:08.440]  And I know if something went wrong in my life, this would be the first five people I could call to help me out.
[59:08.440 --> 59:12.440]  I really appreciate everything you guys taught me this year.
[59:12.440 --> 59:16.440]  And all together throughout the times that I've known you Jeff, especially you.
[59:16.440 --> 59:20.440]  Taught me a lot since I've moved here from North Carolina.
[59:20.440 --> 59:22.440]  Now I feel like I'm from Colorado.
[59:22.440 --> 59:24.440]  Welcome home.
[59:24.440 --> 59:30.440]  Dude, thank you. I didn't realize I taught you so much. I didn't realize you absorbed so much of what I taught you.
[59:30.440 --> 59:32.440]  I learned from you guys too. It's not just me teaching you guys.
[59:32.440 --> 59:36.440]  I come and parrot a lot of shit that Spence says just in my own language.
[59:36.440 --> 59:39.440]  I learn shit from you guys every day. So thank you guys too.
[59:39.440 --> 59:41.440]  Thanks man, that means a lot to me.
[59:41.440 --> 59:42.440]  No problem.
[59:42.440 --> 59:44.440]  That goes for both of you guys.
[59:44.440 --> 59:45.440]  Yeah.
[59:45.440 --> 59:46.440]  And Spence.
[59:46.440 --> 59:47.440]  And Sean.
[59:47.440 --> 59:48.440]  Yeah, Sean.
[59:48.440 --> 59:49.440]  And even Clint.
[59:49.440 --> 59:51.440]  Mike. Mike's taught me to grow shit on accident.
[59:51.440 --> 59:54.440]  Just refreshing your mind.
[59:54.440 --> 59:56.440]  Not everything about growing is about growing.
[59:56.440 --> 01:00:00.440]  There's simple shit in your grow room that Mike may go, why is that turned that way?
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.440]  If you turn that way you'd get better airflow.
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.440]  And I'm just giving random examples.
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:06.440]  There's like physics and shit to be done in the grow room.
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:08.440]  Shout out to Tony also. Sorry I skipped that one.
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:11.440]  He keeps the website going. He keeps the feed going.
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:14.440]  And he's one of the, when I said physics, I thought of Tony.
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:16.440]  He knows about airflow and a lot of that shit.
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:19.440]  So guys, even if your friends aren't the best growers, you can learn accidentally about HVAC.
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:21.440]  You can learn plumbing.
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:22.440]  All that shit comes in handy.
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:24.440]  So don't ever take anybody for granted.
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:25.440]  Shout out to Vaughn.
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:26.440]  Yeah, and Scott.
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:27.440]  And Scott.
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:30.440]  They'll never listen to this probably, but they at least deserve the big love.
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:32.440]  My wife listens to it actually.
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:34.440]  And Ralph, just while we're listening people.
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:35.440]  Yeah, what's up Ralph?
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.440]  I learned to drywall already this year.
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:40.440]  You're a learning shit, douchebag, way to fucking name it.
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:44.440]  Yeah, big shout out to Ralph who taught me how to drywall.
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:48.440]  44's method of learning will get you far places, all right?
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:51.440]  Yo Fish, I'm sorry I was dissing you on the other show, bro.
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:52.440]  I'm sorry, man.
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:53.440]  No, he's still your friend.
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:55.440]  Also, shout out to Dreadful J.
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:56.440]  I haven't given her a shout out in a while.
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:57.440]  She listens.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.440]  Shout out for impact resistant glasses.
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:01.440]  This show should just be called Episode 50 Mad.
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:02.440]  Shout outs.
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:07.440]  Earlier when you were shouting out, it reminded me of 40 ounces to freedom.
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:09.440]  That's kind of what I was going for, honestly.
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:11.440]  Your mom called. She said take a nap.
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:13.440]  That's kind of what I was going for.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.440]  I don't know a goddamn thing about Miami.
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:19.440]  I'll try to put some music in the background of that shit.
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:21.440]  Just put that music in there.
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:22.440]  See if you can find it.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:23.440]  I'll get sued, bro.
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.440]  I won't get sued, but iTunes will take it down.
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:28.440]  They've never taken down more.
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:32.440]  You're telling me you can't go down there and make a dub version somehow of every single instrument?
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:35.440]  Back in the day, I used to play Marlon Asher and Popular Reggae.
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:38.440]  They never flagged any of my shows, but I only had like 100 listens back then.
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:39.440]  So nobody even noticed.
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:41.440]  Popular Reggae, that shit's funny, bro.
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:44.440]  Thanks.
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:47.440]  You mean that song?
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:49.440]  Good job, Barney Stinson.
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.440]  Thanks for listening, you guys.
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:53.440]  I promise the episodes are going to get better.
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:55.440]  I promise the guests are going to stay high caliber.
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:56.440]  Everybody that's here is...
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:58.440]  We're just high.
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:02.440]  Now he's a smartass after that dab he took.
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:05.440]  Everybody that's here is invited back whenever they'd like to be back.
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:07.440]  I promise I'll have everybody here again.
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.440]  We need to get some more ladies on the show.
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:12.440]  It's harder to get ladies on the show.
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:13.440]  There aren't as many ladies.
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:16.440]  Guys have more shit to talk about because we're kind of egoists.
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:19.440]  You hang out with a bunch of badass dudes.
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:23.440]  I've got a squad of guys around me all the time.
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:24.440]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.440]  I saw that picture you posted, like, all these dudes protect me.
[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:27.440]  Hell yeah, we all have your back, dude.
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:29.440]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:32.440]  I'm standing in the back there with a big old smile like I got her back forever.
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:33.440]  That was a Merry Christmas picture.
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:37.440]  I know there's other growers in the scene and Instagram and all that stuff,
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:43.440]  but you're the only one here locally that's at least known for producing killer stuff.
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:45.440]  Lady growers.
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:48.440]  Shit, ladies that want to be on the podcast that have something to contribute about cannabis.
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:50.440]  If it's your opinion, your view.
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:54.440]  I know very, very few female growers that I have a lot of respect for.
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:57.440]  But hopefully some will step up.
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.440]  Come be on the show if you want.
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:00.440]  We are in Pueblo, Colorado on the south side.
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:02.440]  All you got to do is send me an email.
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:03.440]  You can call me.
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:04.440]  You can Instagram.
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:05.440]  You can Facebook me.
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:07.440]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:09.440]  I'm on Instagram at iRegenetics.
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:11.440]  That was a big old dab.
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:12.440]  Yeah, it was, dude.
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.440]  Spencer just gave me a fat dab.
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:15.440]  And he got up and left as he did it.
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:16.440]  He took it off somewhere.
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:18.440]  Dude, there was no part of that.
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:21.440]  The email is in the other room turned on, so that could be where he went.
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:25.440]  There wasn't any room on the table for the email tonight with all the gear I had.
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:27.440]  It was such a fat dab it started coming out of my nose.
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:30.440]  It's called an angry dragon, isn't it?
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:31.440]  Yeah.
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:33.440]  This is the terminology.
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:34.440]  All right.
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:35.440]  On that note, we're going to wrap up the show.
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:36.440]  I love you guys.
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:37.440]  Thanks for listening.
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:40.440]  Everybody that came, everybody that's listening, everyone that downloaded the show, everyone that contributes.
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:42.440]  Hey, also a little bit of pandering.
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:49.440]  I added, we added, Tony technically added at the request of myself a donate button on the iRegenetics website.
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:53.440]  If you go to iRegenetics.com, find the Grow From Your Heart podcast tab.
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:55.440]  There is a donate button at the top.
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:03.440]  If you feel like this show was worth a couple of bucks and you want to make a slight contribution, you can make a donation to the show.
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:08.440]  I will thank you on the show if you'd like me to, or you can tell me not to say your name.
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:14.440]  I'm not begging for money, but a couple of people said that if I had the donation button, they would throw donations in there.
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:18.440]  And why not take a donation if someone's trying to offer it?
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:19.440]  No, absolutely.
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:21.440]  You put so much of your time and effort into this.
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:22.440]  You deserve it.
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:23.440]  Well, thank you.
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:26.440]  You can put it back into the podcast for necessary equipment.
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:27.440]  I'll buy another microphone.
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.440]  We can potentially have more giveaways.
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:33.440]  You can also put it as anonymous so you don't even need to know.
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:36.440]  It's just three bucks that came from nowhere.
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:40.440]  And then I learned about something else that I may try to do in the future.
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:42.440]  It's called a money bomb is what this guy called it.
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:45.440]  If you listen to a lot of podcasts, you may already know about it.
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:48.440]  I don't want to tell you too much about it because I haven't paid too much attention to how to do it.
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:54.440]  But it sounds like a great idea to where it will give me money to give away to my listeners and also help fund the podcast a little.
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:57.440]  And like Maddie said, I do put some time into this.
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:02.440]  They everybody here spent about an hour with me before we even recorded putting the show together.
[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:10.440]  I was thinking while you were talking what it would cost to get all of us in a room, say, for like a two hour consultation with the business.
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:14.440]  And it's in the thousands.
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:15.440]  Oh, yeah. I'm expensive for that kind of thing.
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:20.440]  If you get all of this at the table, being is up front and honest as we are with the podcast.
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:24.440]  And I'm sitting here thinking about the content over the last 50 episodes.
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:37.440]  And if you go back and cherry pick, say, like the outdoor grow less than episodes or in the growing and curing and harvesting episodes, that's like job training.
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:43.440]  If you pay attention and take notes, you can fully have a career based on that information.
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:48.440]  If you put a couple of years of practice into it and do your own independent research, that's the found it.
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:50.440]  That's like a bachelor's degree in weed.
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:54.440]  Yeah. Not even fucking around a little.
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:06:00.440]  That's legit. And Jesse's outdoor lessons this year basically walked me through my outdoor this year.
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:02.440]  You know, like there was there was trying to cure episode.
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:04.440]  We got your weed dried and cured. Absolutely.
[01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:09.440]  And then Sean came and talked to you about organics and taught you how to not go buy bottled nutrients anymore.
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:14.440]  And I mean, just yesterday I mixed up grow Kashi, you know, I'm saying like, oh, look out.
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:17.440]  So here for a year, mixing grow Kashi. Right.
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:20.440]  I want to get an extract artist on here that will teach us how to make cash.
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:25.440]  But at the same time, that's risky because we can't teach you how to open blast because that's not legit.
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:27.440]  And then nobody wants to give away their stuff.
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:29.440]  We can sit around and tell you how a whole bunch.
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:32.440]  Maybe we'll get somebody to come teach us how to make water hash.
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:35.440]  We'll get Fred Morris or somebody to come teach you how to make water hash.
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:36.440]  A very good idea. Yeah.
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:38.440]  Fred Morris, if you listen to the show, hit me up, bro.
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:41.440]  Please. I want you to come on and teach us how to make water hash.
[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:46.440]  You know, so long across the table there doesn't know, knows quite a bit about water hash as well.
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:50.440]  He's keeping his head down. But, you know, you know, he also knows who Fred Morris is.
[01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:54.440]  So he knows why I'm saying, I'm not trying to call you out.
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:59.440]  I'm just saying that, you know, I've smoked it and it was very impressive.
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:03.440]  You know, and maybe I haven't had that much bubble hash, but I do.
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:05.440]  All right. Spence got a D.D.
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.440]  He had to go charge his phone.
[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:09.440]  Spence was over there digging through the prize packs a minute ago.
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.440]  You can't give him that many dabs for a podcast.
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:13.440]  It's just how we roll.
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:15.440]  All he's thinking about is damn Amy Donuts.
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:18.440]  Oh, dude. It's nine o'clock. They're closed.
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:21.440]  What? I thought they closed at seven.
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:22.440]  They closed at seven.
[01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:24.440]  We would have so stopped, dude.
[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:25.440]  I would have stopped on the way.
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:28.440]  Yeah, I thought I said it's nine. They're closed.
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:30.440]  No, you told me the other day they closed at seven.
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:32.440]  Yeah, they closed at seven. That's what I'm saying.
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:33.440]  It's nine and they are closed.
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:34.440]  Oh, okay.
[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:37.440]  You mean as they were open till nine.
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:40.440]  First rule Amy's Donuts is you don't say anything about Amy's Donuts.
[01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:41.440]  That's right.
[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:42.440]  So you just beep all of that.
[01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:43.440]  Shout out to Amy.
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:47.440]  I've never had to go to a donut place and be like nothing with bacon on it, please.
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:49.440]  Like that's weird for me.
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:50.440]  I'm a vegetarian. I don't want your bacon.
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:52.440]  Maple bacon donut.
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:55.440]  Is the vanilla cheesecake ones that you like so much?
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:56.440]  It is absolutely my favorite.
[01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:59.440]  Vanilla cheesecake is top notch.
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.440]  I'm that banana something.
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:02.440]  Banana Foster.
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:04.440]  Banana Foster, yes.
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:07.440]  The Elvis is good. The peanut butter and jelly.
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:11.440]  Come be on the podcast. Come get some Amy's Donuts. Enjoy Pueblo.
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:12.440]  We were trying to get a bite.
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:13.440]  Smoke some Fat Dads.
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:15.440]  The green chili one is banging.
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:17.440]  All right, let's wrap up this show, you guys.
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:18.440]  Big shout out to everybody that listened.
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:22.440]  If you made it an hour and ten minutes into this podcast, I love you every day.

[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:26.440]  Follow the grapist.
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:28.440]  Spence is packing up. He's stretching.
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:30.440]  You going to the gym after this, bro?
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:31.440]  He's going to leave me.
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:33.440]  It looks like he's about to.
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:34.440]  He's going to jog home.
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:35.440]  He's going to run up out of here.
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:37.440]  Let's finish this up before Maddie has to walk home.
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:38.440]  Here we go.
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:41.440]  Now that the show is over, please go to iTunes and or Stitcher.
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:46.440]  Go to the iTunes store, to the Stitcher main page and search for I Grow Culture slash Grow From Your Heart.
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:48.440]  By the time this comes out, it better be fully switched to Grow From Your Heart.
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:50.440]  I'm going to get that logo speed rush made.
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:52.440]  I've got to do a couple things.
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:53.440]  I'm working on that.
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:56.440]  I'm working on another company also so that I've got multiple logos to work with.
[01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:59.440]  But don't worry, Bender, I appreciate your logo and I need it also.
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:00.440]  Keep it coming.
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:01.440]  But I've got another idea that I want to use.
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:02.440]  So I need that logo.
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:04.440]  I haven't been home to talk to him.
[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:06.440]  He doesn't reply to my emails either, so it's cool.
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:07.440]  Search for the show.
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:08.440]  Find the review section.

[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:16.440]  If you think I completely suck at podcasting, you can say that.
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:19.440]  If you think I've got a shitty voice or an awesome voice, you can say that too.
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:22.440]  Just tell me what you think and I will try to improve and make you happy.
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:24.440]  Or I might just ignore you and block you.

[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:39.440]  My daughter is trying to go on this adventure in Hawaii, an educational adventure,
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:41.440]  and most of the money will probably go to that, to tell you the truth.
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:44.440]  I'm not trying to kiss your ass, but that's probably what I'm going to do with it.
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:45.440]  Truth.

[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:07.440]  walking around in my house over there.
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:10.440]  He's like exploring your home.
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.440]  Going through your glass collection.
[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:13.440]  That's cool.
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:17.440]  Yeah, he's been through the dab rings, prize packs, and he's just having a ball.
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:20.440]  His eyes were as red as that microphone cover when the show started.
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:23.440]  I'll have breakfast ready, I guarantee.
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:25.440]  We'll let him keep roaming around the house.
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:27.440]  With bacon, please.
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:29.440]  Shout-out, Spence. Shout-out, bro. Thanks for coming.
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:32.440]  Hope you got some food somewhere close.
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.440]  That's what I'm thinking about, too.
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:36.440]  Thanks for everybody that showed up.
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:37.440]  Starved.
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:40.440]  Starved. Everyone's dying. We're going to go get some food before we die, everybody.
[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:43.440]  Thanks again for listening. Check us out on episode 51.
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.440]  Until then, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:54.480]  The race hand raised with the torch
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:57.480]  Get your paper, you don't get the paper from the porch
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:59.480]  I used to get my flavors from my neighbors to the north
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:02.480]  Now Cali runs the valley henceforth
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:05.480]  First place in the race hand raised with the torch
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:08.480]  Get the paper, you don't get the paper from the porch
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:10.480]  I used to get my flavors from my neighbors to the north
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:13.480]  Now Cali runs the valley henceforth
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:16.480]  Linus with the bumpin' track, let me get another pack
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:19.480]  Blowing on the butter so you know the motherfucker's back
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:22.480]  My crew is gifted and we lift it like a hovercraft
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:25.480]  Lumberjacks coming for your trees, then we run the back
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:28.480]  All my friends creating gold from a bunch of scraps
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:31.480]  We set the trends, break the mold, then we run the back
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:33.480]  People thanking me for showing them the way to go
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:36.480]  Like, way to go, B.H.O. made it on the radio
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:38.480]  Give me a dabber and a skillet and nail
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:41.480]  Or a mic, cause I'm a rapper who can kill it as well
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:44.480]  Entrepreneur man, building the wealth
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:47.480]  Iller than Duff, so cool I only chill with myself
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:50.480]  Yeah, so if you're wallowing I would bet
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:53.480]  It's probably cause you wanna be following my footsteps
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:56.480]  If you're a fan then it's likely you're a pioneer
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:59.480]  You can look back on this day and say I was here
