[00:11.390 --> 00:22.440]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community. It's time for episode number 83 of the Grow From
[00:22.440 --> 00:27.080]  Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's
[00:27.080 --> 00:31.360]  right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker
[00:31.360 --> 00:34.960]  or a veteran dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious
[00:34.960 --> 00:39.360]  about the current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you. I'm your
[00:39.360 --> 00:42.560]  host. I'm your host. My name is Ross DeJeff. I can't even get through this intro today.

[02:19.880 --> 02:25.040]  dabbed the fuck out. I hope everything went your way. Before we go any further, I do want
[02:25.040 --> 02:30.740]  to give a huge, huge shout out to Kind Pain Management in Denver, Colorado. They do not
[02:30.740 --> 02:35.080]  sponsor the show. They are not supporters of the show, but what they are doing is they
[02:35.080 --> 02:39.280]  are growing Lemon Jeffery, which is a strain I bred. I put that together and I got some
[02:39.280 --> 02:43.680]  seeds in their hands and they are killing it. They have posted some lab tests up on
[02:43.680 --> 02:48.800]  their Instagram feed. They're hitting over 26% THC on the Lemon Jeffery. And the best
[02:48.800 --> 02:54.080]  part is it is on shelves now. You can head to Kind Pain Management. They are a medical
[02:54.080 --> 02:58.240]  and a recreational facility, so anybody can grab some Lemon Jeffery. Check out what I
[02:58.240 --> 03:03.400]  bred. Check out what Kind Pain Management did with it. Big, huge shout out to them.
[03:03.400 --> 03:08.040]  One thing I want to do on this podcast is check out a video that somebody sent to me
[03:08.040 --> 03:13.720]  of 3x Cops Smoking Weed. The video is 6 minutes long. I'm going to watch the whole thing.
[03:13.720 --> 03:17.160]  I may edit parts of this out of the podcast so that you guys don't have to sit through
[03:17.160 --> 03:21.360]  6 whole minutes. I may skip through parts of it. We'll see how my ADD kicks in as we
[03:21.360 --> 03:25.360]  do this. But I think this is a great video. We're going to watch parts of it and then
[03:25.360 --> 03:30.320]  we will talk about it. So let me kill the theme song and we are going to play this Cops
[03:30.320 --> 03:35.800]  Smoking Weed video. So it starts off with some dubstep music. I don't know what that's
[03:35.800 --> 03:41.560]  called but some really some music. And it shows three older dudes, old enough to be
[03:41.560 --> 03:45.320]  our fathers, taking bong rips. And then here's what they have to say.
[03:45.320 --> 03:51.400]  The last time I smoked was in probably 1968 when I was in college.
[03:51.400 --> 03:57.200]  First time I smoked I was 14 years old. I got caught the first time I smoked.
[03:57.200 --> 03:58.200]  And for some reason, there we go.
[03:58.280 --> 04:11.280]  I was on a waterbed with a very agreeable woman and listening to Rhapsody in Blue, which I know lasts for about 18 minutes and 40 seconds.
[04:11.280 --> 04:15.280]  And it lasted for, oh hell, two or three hours.
[04:15.280 --> 04:22.280]  So all three of these ex-cops have just admitted to having used cannabis illegally in their life.
[04:22.360 --> 04:28.360]  And now what they're doing is taking a field sobriety test before they smoke any cannabis.
[04:28.360 --> 04:32.360]  So there are three retired cops. They all know how to fuck with each other and give each other a sobriety test.
[04:32.360 --> 04:37.360]  This one old guy has got such shitty old knees that he can barely pass the heel to toe walk.
[04:37.360 --> 04:41.360]  But this says also that it was recorded in Washington where cannabis is legalized.
[04:41.360 --> 04:43.360]  So they're keeping these cops out of trouble.
[04:43.360 --> 04:46.360]  Cop number one now, they're in plain clothes. They don't look like cops.
[04:46.360 --> 04:48.360]  Their facial hair looks like cops, you guys.
[04:48.440 --> 04:50.440]  Plain clothes guy number one is now hitting the bong.
[04:50.440 --> 04:53.440]  He had the presenter of the video light it for him.
[04:53.440 --> 04:55.440]  And now, here we'll let you hear it.
[04:55.440 --> 05:03.440]  I graduated from WSU in 1970 and went to work right in the same year and didn't retire until 97.
[05:03.440 --> 05:05.440]  There you go.
[05:06.440 --> 05:09.440]  Now this old dude's taking a pretty fat bong rip.
[05:09.440 --> 05:11.440]  That was a good rip.
[05:11.440 --> 05:16.440]  My name is David. I was a reserve police officer from 1997 through 2004.
[05:16.520 --> 05:18.520]  Second dude took a pretty nice bong rip.
[05:18.520 --> 05:26.520]  My name is Robert. Went to the police academy in the fall of 1970 and worked until the fall of 1986.
[05:26.520 --> 05:33.520]  And then after that, I taught as a freelance trainer mostly for the Criminal Justice Training Commission.
[05:33.520 --> 05:37.520]  Taught at the police academy for 9 or 10 years.
[05:37.520 --> 05:39.520]  Alright, so none of these guys knew how to carb.
[05:39.520 --> 05:41.520]  They've all taken a couple of fat bong hits.
[05:41.520 --> 05:43.520]  And now it's starting to kick in.
[05:43.520 --> 05:45.520]  The one guy just said, so now what? We wait?
[05:45.600 --> 05:47.600]  And this is where the fun starts.
[05:47.600 --> 05:49.600]  The clock shows you 5 minutes have gone by.
[05:49.600 --> 05:51.600]  And we'll let you hear what they say.
[05:51.600 --> 05:53.600]  I think I had him stuck on my mustache or something.
[05:58.600 --> 06:00.600]  You know, I thought about that a lot.
[06:00.600 --> 06:02.600]  And as far as I can remember, I never arrested anyone for it.
[06:02.600 --> 06:06.600]  But I took a lot of pot away from people and threw it away in front of them.
[06:06.600 --> 06:10.600]  And I thought that was a bigger deterrent than actually writing a criminal citation.
[06:10.600 --> 06:12.600]  I think it should be legal.
[06:12.680 --> 06:16.680]  I think it should be more widely available for medical reasons.
[06:16.680 --> 06:19.680]  It's like the last piece of prohibition.
[06:19.680 --> 06:21.680]  So do you believe marijuana is a gateway drug?
[06:21.680 --> 06:23.680]  I think it certainly can be a gateway drug.
[06:23.680 --> 06:25.680]  This is my favorite part, you guys.
[06:25.680 --> 06:27.680]  I'd like to respond to that too because...
[06:27.680 --> 06:30.680]  I'm going to pause it because the host is a little bit hard to hear on this show.
[06:30.680 --> 06:32.680]  His audio is terrible.
[06:32.680 --> 06:36.680]  So what the guy just asked these cops is, do you think marijuana is a gateway drug?
[06:36.680 --> 06:39.680]  And I'm going to back up about just a couple of seconds here.
[06:39.760 --> 06:43.760]  Because this is honestly my favorite part of the video is this guy's answer.
[06:43.760 --> 06:46.760]  Okay, so they just asked him, do you think marijuana is a gateway drug?
[06:46.760 --> 06:47.760]  And I'll hit play.
[06:47.760 --> 06:49.760]  Do you believe marijuana is a gateway drug?
[06:49.760 --> 06:51.760]  I think it certainly can be a gateway drug, yes.
[06:51.760 --> 06:55.760]  I'd like to respond to that too because if you look at it,
[06:55.760 --> 06:59.760]  everyone who's a heroin addict started out drinking milk.
[07:01.760 --> 07:03.760]  So you're saying no, it's a gateway drug?
[07:03.760 --> 07:04.760]  Apparently.
[07:04.760 --> 07:08.760]  I mean, that's the argument about marijuana and I'm not sure that's true.
[07:08.840 --> 07:11.840]  So that guy just said that milk is the gateway drug, you guys.
[07:11.840 --> 07:15.840]  Because everybody that does heroin started off drinking milk.
[07:15.840 --> 07:18.840]  I don't know if he really feels that way or if he's just too high
[07:18.840 --> 07:21.840]  and hasn't been high in years and that's what just came out of his head.
[07:21.840 --> 07:25.840]  But that was my favorite statement from this whole video was hearing that cop say
[07:25.840 --> 07:28.840]  that everybody that is on heroin started off using milk.
[07:28.840 --> 07:30.840]  So milk is the gateway drug.
[07:30.840 --> 07:33.840]  Also, the one cop said he's never arrested people,
[07:33.840 --> 07:35.840]  but he's taken a lot of weed away from people.
[07:35.840 --> 07:36.840]  That's respectable.
[07:36.920 --> 07:39.920]  His job was to arrest people for weed and he didn't do it.
[07:39.920 --> 07:41.920]  So he's kind of on our team a little bit.
[07:41.920 --> 07:43.920]  The other cop said it should be legal
[07:43.920 --> 07:46.920]  and it should be more readily available for medical purposes.
[07:46.920 --> 07:48.920]  So I applaud these cops so far.
[07:48.920 --> 07:50.920]  Let's keep watching this video.
[07:50.920 --> 07:51.920]  Now this is 15 minutes later.
[07:51.920 --> 07:54.920]  I don't know if this is 15 minutes from the time they took the bong hit
[07:54.920 --> 07:57.920]  or if this is 15 minutes from the clip that we just saw
[07:57.920 --> 08:00.920]  which would put them about 20 minutes into this stoned adventure.
[08:00.920 --> 08:02.920]  So I'm gonna hit play, turn the volume up again
[08:02.920 --> 08:04.920]  and we will see what these old guys are up to.
[08:05.000 --> 08:07.000]  And that's the clock.
[08:08.000 --> 08:10.000]  So now they're smoking a joint.
[08:10.000 --> 08:12.000]  They're hitting the bong.
[08:12.000 --> 08:14.000]  Showing a montage.
[08:14.000 --> 08:15.000]  Now 25 minutes later.
[08:15.000 --> 08:19.000]  Starting at 93, count backwards by 7.
[08:19.000 --> 08:21.000]  And now they're gonna try to do sobriety tests.
[08:21.000 --> 08:23.000]  86.
[08:24.000 --> 08:26.000]  And the question he just asked him is fucked up.
[08:26.000 --> 08:29.000]  He said starting at 93, count backwards by 7.
[08:29.000 --> 08:31.000]  Lift your right foot up.
[08:31.000 --> 08:32.000]  I can't do that sober.
[08:32.000 --> 08:34.000]  Hold it for 20 seconds.
[08:34.080 --> 08:36.080]  Count to 10.
[08:37.080 --> 08:39.080]  How about 5?
[08:40.080 --> 08:42.080]  So now they're doing the hold your leg up test
[08:42.080 --> 08:44.080]  and the guy couldn't do 5 seconds.
[08:44.080 --> 08:47.080]  This one guy did pretty good doing the heel to toe test.
[08:47.080 --> 08:48.080]  Better than before.
[08:48.080 --> 08:50.080]  Yeah, he said better than before.
[08:50.080 --> 08:53.080]  This dude was doing a heel to toe test a minute ago
[08:53.080 --> 08:56.080]  and I said that he was fucking it up because his knees were so bad.
[08:56.080 --> 08:57.080]  Now that he smoked a little bit of reefer,
[08:57.080 --> 08:59.080]  this dude just nailed the heel to toe test
[08:59.080 --> 09:01.080]  because his pain doesn't hurt in his knees anymore.
[09:01.160 --> 09:04.160]  So they accidentally found a good reason to use marijuana.
[09:04.160 --> 09:05.160]  Alright, I'm gonna hit play on the video again.
[09:05.160 --> 09:06.160]  We'll keep going.
[09:07.160 --> 09:09.160]  I feel a little floaty.
[09:09.160 --> 09:11.160]  It's not unpleasant,
[09:11.160 --> 09:21.160]  but it's shadowed by the faint discomfort of not being fully whatever.
[09:22.160 --> 09:24.160]  That's kind of what police officers do.
[09:24.160 --> 09:25.160]  They're very staunch.
[09:25.160 --> 09:26.160]  They're very in control all the time.
[09:26.160 --> 09:28.160]  This doesn't necessarily allow you to do that.
[09:28.240 --> 09:30.240]  This is actually pretty comfortable though.
[09:30.240 --> 09:34.240]  I mean, it's relaxed and I don't feel like I have to be in control.
[09:34.240 --> 09:35.240]  It's pretty cool.
[09:36.240 --> 09:37.240]  So this guy's enjoying it.
[09:37.240 --> 09:39.240]  And this is 45 minutes later.
[09:39.240 --> 09:41.240]  The reason for legalizing marijuana is that it takes,
[09:41.240 --> 09:43.240]  I mean, some of the stuff you can buy in the street now,
[09:43.240 --> 09:44.240]  you never know what it's cut with.
[09:44.240 --> 09:45.240]  I don't agree with that.
[09:45.240 --> 09:47.240]  He's claiming that marijuana is cut with stuff,
[09:47.240 --> 09:48.240]  which is weird,
[09:48.240 --> 09:50.240]  but that's his own uneducated,
[09:50.240 --> 09:51.240]  you know, he doesn't know.
[09:51.240 --> 09:52.240]  You don't know where it came from
[09:52.240 --> 09:53.240]  and what it's going to do to you.
[09:53.240 --> 09:54.240]  Well, yeah,
[09:54.240 --> 09:55.240]  and it also costs,
[09:55.240 --> 09:56.240]  you know,
[09:56.320 --> 09:58.320]  more to put somebody in prison,
[09:58.320 --> 09:59.320]  not jail,
[09:59.320 --> 10:00.320]  but prison,
[10:01.320 --> 10:03.320]  than it costs to send them to Harvard.
[10:03.320 --> 10:04.320]  You hear that?
[10:04.320 --> 10:06.320]  It costs more to put somebody in prison
[10:06.320 --> 10:07.320]  than to send them to Harvard.
[10:07.320 --> 10:09.320]  Now they're playing the game where you put a card on your name
[10:09.320 --> 10:10.320]  and try to guess who's what.
[10:10.320 --> 10:12.320]  We're going to skip part of this.
[10:12.320 --> 10:13.320]  It's unnecessary.
[10:13.320 --> 10:14.320]  But you guys,
[10:14.320 --> 10:15.320]  I don't know.
[10:15.320 --> 10:16.320]  Given in the right circumstances,
[10:16.320 --> 10:17.320]  they just asked,
[10:17.320 --> 10:18.320]  I'm going to back up two seconds.
[10:18.320 --> 10:19.320]  They just asked,
[10:19.320 --> 10:20.320]  would you do it again?
[10:20.320 --> 10:21.320]  Is the question.
[10:21.320 --> 10:22.320]  And here's their responses.
[10:22.320 --> 10:23.320]  I'm letting the YouTube video load.
[10:23.320 --> 10:24.320]  I told my son on the way over here,
[10:24.320 --> 10:25.320]  I was,
[10:25.400 --> 10:27.400]  I had a pretty good headache coming on
[10:27.400 --> 10:29.400]  and I think my headache started to clear up.
[10:29.400 --> 10:30.400]  I mean,
[10:30.400 --> 10:31.400]  it's going away.
[10:31.400 --> 10:32.400]  Would you do it again?
[10:34.400 --> 10:35.400]  I don't know.
[10:35.400 --> 10:36.400]  Given in the right circumstances,
[10:36.400 --> 10:37.400]  I suppose.
[10:37.400 --> 10:38.400]  Yeah,
[10:38.400 --> 10:39.400]  I'll smoke again.
[10:39.400 --> 10:40.400]  Probably,
[10:40.400 --> 10:41.400]  given the opportunity.
[10:41.400 --> 10:43.400]  So all three of these guys said they will smoke again.
[10:43.400 --> 10:45.400]  Let me end the video with you guys taking one more hit.
[10:45.400 --> 10:47.400]  And since that was their answer,
[10:47.400 --> 10:48.400]  he wants them to hit the bong one more time.
[10:48.400 --> 10:49.400]  So they're all going to take,
[10:49.400 --> 10:50.400]  now this is great.
[10:51.400 --> 10:53.400]  They're doing a montage of these three older dudes
[10:53.480 --> 10:55.480]  taking bong hits and smoking a joint.
[10:55.480 --> 10:56.480]  And it looks like,
[10:56.480 --> 10:59.480]  like they're trying to make it a scene from the hangover or something.
[10:59.480 --> 11:00.480]  It's pretty good.
[11:00.480 --> 11:01.480]  All right.
[11:01.480 --> 11:07.480]  So I'm going to wrap up this video because I honestly don't know how much I was allowed to play of that video without some sort of usage rights.
[11:07.480 --> 11:09.480]  Let me give a shout out to the person that posted it.
[11:09.480 --> 11:10.480]  I found it on YouTube.
[11:10.480 --> 11:11.480]  It's by cut video.
[11:11.480 --> 11:12.480]  Make sure you subscribe to them.
[11:12.480 --> 11:13.480]  They've got 587,
[11:13.480 --> 11:14.480]  139 followers,
[11:14.480 --> 11:15.480]  be 140 for them.
[11:17.480 --> 11:18.480]  They would appreciate that.
[11:18.480 --> 11:21.480]  I'm going to go ahead and click like on this video so they can get some credit there.
[11:21.560 --> 11:22.560]  But make sure you check it out,
[11:22.560 --> 11:23.560]  guys.
[11:23.560 --> 11:24.560]  It's a funny video.
[11:24.560 --> 11:25.560]  You're going to want to watch it yourself.
[11:25.560 --> 11:26.560]  All right.
[11:26.560 --> 11:27.560]  Now that we've gotten through watching that video,
[11:27.560 --> 11:28.560]  let me talk about it a little bit.
[11:29.560 --> 11:32.560]  One thing I really liked is that these dudes seemed open minded.
[11:32.560 --> 11:37.560]  They didn't remind me of a lot of the cops that I've dealt with that are real standoffish and think they have to be in control of everything.
[11:38.560 --> 11:41.560]  The one cop actually said that that's a cop's job is to be in control.
[11:41.560 --> 11:42.560]  And once he smoked a little bit of reefer,
[11:43.560 --> 11:46.560]  he wanted to relax and lighten up and not be such a prick of a cop.
[11:46.560 --> 11:50.560]  So I liked that he was open minded and wanted to participate.
[11:50.640 --> 11:52.640]  I liked that the one guy said it should be legal.
[11:52.640 --> 11:56.640]  And then what I really liked was that they all wanted to smoke again.
[11:56.640 --> 11:58.640]  They said, yes, we would do this again.
[11:58.640 --> 12:02.640]  So maybe those cops are going to go talk to one of their friends who is still a cop and be like,
[12:02.640 --> 12:05.640]  you know what, dude, we got stoned on this video and it's not as bad as you think.
[12:05.640 --> 12:07.640]  Maybe one of their friends is going to watch this video.
[12:07.640 --> 12:11.640]  Maybe this video is going to help people change their opinions of cannabis.
[12:11.640 --> 12:14.640]  And even if it even if you're already a fan of cannabis,
[12:14.640 --> 12:16.640]  I recommend watching it because it was highly entertaining.
[12:16.640 --> 12:18.640]  Big shout out to whoever sent that video to me.
[12:18.640 --> 12:19.640]  I do not remember who it was.
[12:19.720 --> 12:20.720]  But I appreciate it.
[12:20.720 --> 12:21.720]  All right.
[12:21.720 --> 12:22.720]  That's enough of the video.
[12:22.720 --> 12:24.720]  I've got a few news articles that I'd like to share with you guys.
[12:24.720 --> 12:27.720]  This article, we'll just jump right to it.
[12:27.720 --> 12:29.720]  This article comes from the Pueblo Chief then.
[12:29.720 --> 12:32.720]  And it is written by Dan Sinta.
[12:32.720 --> 12:35.720]  No, it's actually written by Kristen M. White.
[12:35.720 --> 12:39.720]  So the headline says, extra marijuana tax money set to hit the roads.
[12:39.720 --> 12:41.720]  And I've talked a little bit about this in previous shows.
[12:41.720 --> 12:43.720]  And it is finally happening.
[12:43.720 --> 12:44.720]  This was my recommendation.
[12:44.720 --> 12:45.720]  And now here you go.
[12:45.720 --> 12:46.720]  Here's the article, you guys.
[12:46.800 --> 12:50.800]  It says, the Pueblo West Metropolitan District will spend an additional $200,000
[12:50.800 --> 12:53.800]  on roads in the community for the remainder of the year.
[12:53.800 --> 12:56.800]  And a threefold approach that Public Works Director Dan Sinta outlined
[12:56.800 --> 12:58.800]  for the board recently.
[12:58.800 --> 13:02.800]  The extra money comes after directors agreed to allocate the $200,000
[13:02.800 --> 13:05.800]  it received from Pueblo County for marijuana tax money
[13:05.800 --> 13:07.800]  toward chip sealing already planned.
[13:07.800 --> 13:12.800]  This county will pay the $200,000 directly to its emulsion supplier,
[13:12.880 --> 13:18.880]  freeing up $200,000 Pueblo West would have spent of its $350,000 budget
[13:18.880 --> 13:21.880]  for chip sealing this year.
[13:21.880 --> 13:25.880]  The highest need we have in the district right now has to do with gravel roads,
[13:25.880 --> 13:26.880]  Sinta told directors.
[13:26.880 --> 13:30.880]  We have 6.2 miles of gravel roads that when we have the storms we've had
[13:30.880 --> 13:34.880]  this spring, the clay underneath fails and some stretches are impassable.
[13:34.880 --> 13:38.880]  It would be our intent to start attacking the repair of those roads
[13:38.880 --> 13:39.880]  as soon as possible.
[13:39.960 --> 13:43.960]  We propose to bring in additional staff, equipment and additional gravel.
[13:43.960 --> 13:46.960]  So, I have recommended this several times you guys.
[13:46.960 --> 13:49.960]  I've said that we should take all this tax money that we're making here
[13:49.960 --> 13:53.960]  in Pueblo, Colorado and fix some of the goddamn potholes all over the roads.
[13:53.960 --> 13:54.960]  Well guess what?
[13:54.960 --> 13:57.960]  They have heard us, the people have spoken, the people listened
[13:57.960 --> 14:00.960]  and now they're going to fix the roads with all of that tax money.
[14:00.960 --> 14:03.960]  So big shout out to the city of Pueblo for actually doing something
[14:03.960 --> 14:04.960]  about the roads.
[14:04.960 --> 14:06.960]  Of course they're starting with dirt roads that are impassable
[14:07.040 --> 14:11.040]  but once those are done they're going to fix the potholes in my city
[14:11.040 --> 14:14.040]  so that my car will not sound like shit when I drive.
[14:14.040 --> 14:15.040]  Thank you.
[14:15.040 --> 14:16.040]  It's about time.
[14:16.040 --> 14:18.040]  Alright, here's another news article.
[14:18.040 --> 14:19.040]  This one comes from Denver.
[14:19.040 --> 14:22.040]  I actually found this news article in the Pueblo Chief then
[14:22.040 --> 14:23.040]  and big shout out to Mike.
[14:23.040 --> 14:25.040]  Make sure you guys follow Nemo Punk.
[14:25.040 --> 14:27.040]  I think it's Nemo Punk 15 on Twitter.
[14:27.040 --> 14:29.040]  Mike sends me a lot of news articles.
[14:29.040 --> 14:30.040]  I appreciate it.
[14:30.040 --> 14:31.040]  Thanks a lot, dude.
[14:31.040 --> 14:33.040]  We'll get right to this article.
[14:33.040 --> 14:36.040]  The headline is raising the bars for pot
[14:36.120 --> 14:38.120]  and this is something else that we've been talking about
[14:38.120 --> 14:41.120]  and hinting at on the podcast and things are finally coming around.
[14:41.120 --> 14:43.120]  So the sub headline says
[14:43.120 --> 14:48.120]  Denver campaign promoting use in over 21 establishments.
[14:48.120 --> 14:53.120]  This article is by Kristen Wyatt of the Associated Press
[14:53.120 --> 14:54.120]  and then it says
[14:54.120 --> 14:56.120]  Denver, beer, wine or weed.
[14:56.120 --> 14:59.120]  Campaign is underway to ask Denver voters about allowing
[14:59.120 --> 15:01.120]  marijuana consumption in bars and other places
[15:01.120 --> 15:03.120]  that only allow people over 21.
[15:03.200 --> 15:06.200]  Activists who campaign for recreational pot legalization
[15:06.200 --> 15:08.200]  in Colorado have launched a petition to drive
[15:08.200 --> 15:12.200]  what they call limited social marijuana consumption at bars.
[15:12.200 --> 15:15.200]  The activists need about 5,000 signatures
[15:15.200 --> 15:17.200]  to get the question on November ballots.
[15:17.200 --> 15:21.200]  It would allow bars or clubs to allow marijuana use
[15:21.200 --> 15:23.200]  as long as patrons bring their own weed
[15:23.200 --> 15:24.200]  and comply with clean air laws.
[15:24.200 --> 15:27.200]  That means the pot they consume would have to be edible
[15:27.200 --> 15:29.200]  or if smoked consumed on an outside patio
[15:29.200 --> 15:31.200]  the way cigarette smoking is regulated now.
[15:31.280 --> 15:34.280]  Outdoor smoking sites would have to be shielded
[15:34.280 --> 15:35.280]  from public view.
[15:35.280 --> 15:38.280]  So if you guys don't know about the Clean Air Act
[15:38.280 --> 15:40.280]  in Colorado you are not allowed to smoke
[15:40.280 --> 15:43.280]  in a restaurant or anywhere that serves food
[15:43.280 --> 15:45.280]  or basically where the public is.
[15:45.280 --> 15:46.280]  You have to get a,
[15:46.280 --> 15:48.280]  shit I don't know the word,
[15:48.280 --> 15:49.280]  tobacco shops have them
[15:49.280 --> 15:51.280]  but you have to get like a smoking license
[15:51.280 --> 15:53.280]  like a tobacco shop or a cigarette shop
[15:53.280 --> 15:54.280]  if you want to smoke in there
[15:54.280 --> 15:57.280]  they apply for a permit and you're able to smoke in there.
[15:57.280 --> 15:59.280]  So with the Clean Air Act
[15:59.360 --> 16:01.360]  we are not able to smoke cannabis
[16:01.360 --> 16:02.360]  inside of a building
[16:02.360 --> 16:03.360]  even if they do allow it
[16:03.360 --> 16:05.360]  we're going to have to step outside
[16:05.360 --> 16:06.360]  to an outdoor area
[16:06.360 --> 16:08.360]  that is shielded from public view.
[16:08.360 --> 16:10.360]  So I'll jump into the article a little bit more here.
[16:10.360 --> 16:11.360]  It says marijuana is now,
[16:11.360 --> 16:14.360]  I don't like how they worded that.
[16:14.360 --> 16:16.360]  I'm going to read it the way it should have been written.
[16:16.360 --> 16:18.360]  It says marijuana is now a legal product
[16:18.360 --> 16:19.360]  for adults in Denver
[16:19.360 --> 16:21.360]  and it's really time that we give adults a place
[16:21.360 --> 16:22.360]  to use it legally and socially
[16:22.360 --> 16:23.360]  said Mason Tvert
[16:23.360 --> 16:25.360]  who ran Colorado's 2012 campaign
[16:25.360 --> 16:27.360]  to legalize recreational pot.
[16:27.440 --> 16:29.440]  We shouldn't be requiring that you sit at home
[16:29.440 --> 16:31.440]  if you choose to use marijuana as an adult
[16:31.440 --> 16:33.440]  and I completely agree with that you guys.
[16:33.440 --> 16:35.440]  There are so many places to buy dank buds in Colorado
[16:35.440 --> 16:37.440]  but there is nowhere to legally go smoke it.
[16:37.440 --> 16:39.440]  So this would change a lot of things
[16:39.440 --> 16:41.440]  and I think it would promote business.
[16:41.440 --> 16:42.440]  People, I wouldn't go to a bar.
[16:42.440 --> 16:43.440]  I have no reason to go to a bar.
[16:43.440 --> 16:44.440]  I don't drink alcohol.
[16:44.440 --> 16:46.440]  I don't want anything to do with bar girls.
[16:46.440 --> 16:47.440]  I don't want to do with bar dudes.
[16:47.440 --> 16:48.440]  I don't like drunk people
[16:48.440 --> 16:49.440]  but if I could go to that club
[16:49.440 --> 16:51.440]  and hang out and take a couple of dabs
[16:51.440 --> 16:53.440]  and hang out with my friends that are drinking
[16:53.440 --> 16:55.440]  I would be way more inclined to go to the bar
[16:55.440 --> 16:56.440]  and then I'd spend a few bucks there
[16:56.520 --> 16:58.520]  because I'd have to buy a soda
[16:58.520 --> 17:00.520]  or some sort of juice or shit
[17:00.520 --> 17:02.520]  to keep my mouth hydrated while I'm dabbing.
[17:02.520 --> 17:03.520]  But anyway, we'll keep going with the article.
[17:03.520 --> 17:06.520]  Colorado law prohibits recreational pot consumption
[17:06.520 --> 17:07.520]  openly and publicly
[17:07.520 --> 17:09.520]  or in a matter that endangers others.
[17:09.520 --> 17:11.520]  It does not, however, bar against consumption
[17:11.520 --> 17:13.520]  in private over 21 clubs.
[17:13.520 --> 17:15.520]  The Denver measure would clarify
[17:15.520 --> 17:17.520]  what counts as a private club
[17:17.520 --> 17:18.520]  and that's something we've been struggling with
[17:18.520 --> 17:19.520]  here a lot in Colorado
[17:19.520 --> 17:21.520]  is getting a private club.
[17:21.520 --> 17:23.520]  Marijuana dispensaries are banned
[17:23.520 --> 17:25.520]  from allowing on-site use
[17:25.600 --> 17:26.600]  of products they sell
[17:26.600 --> 17:28.600]  and from selling alcohol or food
[17:28.600 --> 17:30.600]  that doesn't contain pot.
[17:30.600 --> 17:32.600]  The Denver proposal would only allow
[17:32.600 --> 17:34.600]  bring your own consumption.
[17:34.600 --> 17:36.600]  Denver wouldn't be the first city
[17:36.600 --> 17:38.600]  to allow marijuana in bars.
[17:38.600 --> 17:39.600]  Netherlands has a state statute
[17:39.600 --> 17:41.600]  allowing limited on-site consumption
[17:41.600 --> 17:43.600]  at over 21 clubs.
[17:43.600 --> 17:45.600]  So in Ned, you can go smoke.
[17:45.600 --> 17:47.600]  I didn't know about that.
[17:47.600 --> 17:49.600]  In Colorado Springs, the state's second largest city
[17:49.600 --> 17:51.600]  has several marijuana clubs
[17:51.600 --> 17:52.600]  that are tolerated
[17:52.600 --> 17:54.600]  if not specifically allowed by statute.
[17:54.680 --> 17:56.680]  Colorado Springs Mayor John Southers
[17:56.680 --> 17:57.680]  has told the city council
[17:57.680 --> 17:59.680]  that he plans to seek regulations
[17:59.680 --> 18:00.680]  on the clubs.
[18:00.680 --> 18:02.680]  The Gazette newspaper recently reported.
[18:02.680 --> 18:04.680]  I've been to three
[18:04.680 --> 18:06.680]  marijuana, cannabis, smoking, social clubs
[18:06.680 --> 18:08.680]  in Colorado Springs
[18:08.680 --> 18:09.680]  and you know it's kind of cool
[18:09.680 --> 18:10.680]  to be able to go and hang out
[18:10.680 --> 18:11.680]  and just smoke.
[18:11.680 --> 18:13.680]  There is the 420 Speakeasy,
[18:13.680 --> 18:14.680]  there's the Lazy Lion
[18:14.680 --> 18:16.680]  and then there's the original Speakeasy
[18:16.680 --> 18:18.680]  and you as an adult
[18:18.680 --> 18:20.680]  21 or over can go into these places
[18:20.680 --> 18:22.680]  and you can have a dab
[18:22.760 --> 18:24.760]  of your own out of their rig.
[18:24.760 --> 18:25.760]  You can bring your rig
[18:25.760 --> 18:27.760]  or a lot of them have a dab bar
[18:27.760 --> 18:28.760]  that will sell you dabs.
[18:28.760 --> 18:30.760]  Some of them you have to pay a little fee
[18:30.760 --> 18:31.760]  to get in, a little cover charge.
[18:31.760 --> 18:32.760]  But if you're an out of towner
[18:32.760 --> 18:33.760]  and you want to come hang out
[18:33.760 --> 18:35.760]  and take some dabs with some Colorado kids
[18:35.760 --> 18:36.760]  you know there's nothing wrong
[18:36.760 --> 18:37.760]  with going to one of those places.
[18:37.760 --> 18:38.760]  It's actually pretty damn fun.
[18:38.760 --> 18:40.760]  I ended up at a kind of a secretive place
[18:40.760 --> 18:41.760]  in Denver
[18:41.760 --> 18:42.760]  taking dabs all night
[18:42.760 --> 18:44.760]  at a Speakeasy up there.
[18:44.760 --> 18:45.760]  And it's just fun
[18:45.760 --> 18:46.760]  hanging out taking dabs in the club.
[18:46.760 --> 18:48.760]  We just replaced alcohol with dabs
[18:48.760 --> 18:49.760]  and it's way fun.
[18:49.760 --> 18:51.760]  I really enjoy it for some reason.
[18:51.840 --> 18:53.840]  Alright, I need to continue with this article.
[18:53.840 --> 18:55.840]  Uh, where are we?
[18:55.840 --> 18:57.840]  The Denver petition comes after
[18:57.840 --> 18:59.840]  that city council rejected pot-friendly bars.
[18:59.840 --> 19:02.840]  Uh, Denver has several underground clubs
[19:02.840 --> 19:03.840]  where patrons use marijuana
[19:03.840 --> 19:04.840]  for a joining fee
[19:04.840 --> 19:06.840]  but the city has intermittently arrested
[19:06.840 --> 19:09.840]  people for public consumption at those clubs.
[19:09.840 --> 19:11.840]  Uh, arresting for smoking weed again?
[19:11.840 --> 19:13.840]  Wait, I thought we were past that.
[19:13.840 --> 19:14.840]  Anyway, the raids and arrests
[19:14.840 --> 19:15.840]  leave tourists with nowhere
[19:15.840 --> 19:17.840]  to legally consume pot they've bought
[19:17.840 --> 19:19.840]  argued supporters of the ballot measure.
[19:19.840 --> 19:20.840]  Among the supporters is Jane West
[19:20.920 --> 19:21.920]  an events promoter
[19:21.920 --> 19:22.920]  who last year arranged
[19:22.920 --> 19:23.920]  Classically Cannabis concert
[19:23.920 --> 19:25.920]  with the Colorado Symphony Orchestra.
[19:25.920 --> 19:27.920]  The city threatened to block the concert
[19:27.920 --> 19:29.920]  citing public consumption laws.
[19:29.920 --> 19:31.920]  The symphony rebranded the concerts
[19:31.920 --> 19:33.920]  as a private bring your own cannabis fundraiser
[19:33.920 --> 19:35.920]  and the city dropped its objections.
[19:35.920 --> 19:37.920]  Uh, West was convicted of a misdemeanor
[19:37.920 --> 19:38.920]  for organizing a separate
[19:38.920 --> 19:40.920]  cannabis-friendly event last year
[19:40.920 --> 19:42.920]  a brunch at a bakery.
[19:42.920 --> 19:44.920]  An eight-person SWAT team descended on the event
[19:44.920 --> 19:46.920]  and shut down the brunch, West said.
[19:46.920 --> 19:47.920]  West became one of the first
[19:47.920 --> 19:49.920]  to sign the Denver petition.
[19:50.000 --> 19:53.000]  The petitions are due by early August.
[19:53.000 --> 19:55.000]  So, uh, where's this petition?
[19:55.000 --> 19:56.000]  Because everybody here in Colorado
[19:56.000 --> 19:57.000]  needs to sign this.
[19:57.000 --> 19:59.000]  If you listen to this podcast,
[19:59.000 --> 20:00.000]  you agree with me
[20:00.000 --> 20:01.000]  that we need to allow
[20:01.000 --> 20:03.000]  recreational consumption
[20:03.000 --> 20:05.000]  in 21 and over establishments
[20:05.000 --> 20:06.000]  for adults
[20:06.000 --> 20:07.000]  out of public view
[20:07.000 --> 20:09.000]  out of indoor smoking areas
[20:09.000 --> 20:10.000]  so that we're able to
[20:10.000 --> 20:12.000]  medicate if we're a medical patient
[20:12.000 --> 20:13.000]  or we're able to recreate
[20:13.000 --> 20:15.000]  if we're a recreational smoker.
[20:15.000 --> 20:16.000]  We should be able to puff.
[20:16.000 --> 20:17.000]  The people are at the bars
[20:17.000 --> 20:19.000]  getting wasted, doing shots
[20:19.080 --> 20:20.080]  fucking getting drunk,
[20:20.080 --> 20:21.080]  getting into fights,
[20:21.080 --> 20:23.080]  raping each other, being heathens.
[20:23.080 --> 20:24.080]  But the people that want to
[20:24.080 --> 20:25.080]  smoke a little bit of weed
[20:25.080 --> 20:27.080]  and relax are being singled out.
[20:27.080 --> 20:28.080]  And I think it sucks
[20:28.080 --> 20:30.080]  and it's time for a revolution.
[20:30.080 --> 20:31.080]  It's time for us to be able to smoke
[20:31.080 --> 20:33.080]  in these clubs where we want to go.
[20:33.080 --> 20:34.080]  I think it'd be a good idea.
[20:34.080 --> 20:35.080]  I think it's kind of dumb
[20:35.080 --> 20:36.080]  that they don't allow it.
[20:36.080 --> 20:37.080]  All right.
[20:37.080 --> 20:39.080]  Big shout out to the Pueblo Chieftain.
[20:39.080 --> 20:41.080]  Big shout out to Kristen Wyatt.
[20:41.080 --> 20:42.080]  You guys, if you're in Colorado,
[20:42.080 --> 20:43.080]  if you're a Colorado resident,
[20:43.080 --> 20:45.080]  find this petition.
[20:45.080 --> 20:46.080]  I'm looking to see
[20:46.080 --> 20:47.080]  if there's a link to it,
[20:47.080 --> 20:48.080]  but there is not.
[20:48.160 --> 20:49.160]  So we need to find
[20:49.160 --> 20:50.160]  this petition somewhere
[20:50.160 --> 20:51.160]  and we need to sign it
[20:51.160 --> 20:53.160]  each and every one of us.
[20:53.160 --> 20:56.160]  So that's enough of that article.
[20:56.160 --> 20:57.160]  Let's go to the next article.
[20:57.160 --> 20:59.160]  This article is a little bit long.
[20:59.160 --> 21:00.160]  Let me see how much time
[21:00.160 --> 21:02.160]  I have got left here in this show.
[21:02.160 --> 21:04.160]  So we've talked recently
[21:04.160 --> 21:06.160]  about the discussion
[21:06.160 --> 21:08.160]  between the natives
[21:08.160 --> 21:09.160]  and the government
[21:09.160 --> 21:11.160]  to allow natives to grow cannabis
[21:11.160 --> 21:13.160]  on native land
[21:13.160 --> 21:15.160]  or Indian reservations.
[21:15.160 --> 21:17.160]  Recently, federal agents
[21:17.240 --> 21:19.240]  have raided two major marijuana grows
[21:19.240 --> 21:22.240]  on tribal land in Modoc County.
[21:22.240 --> 21:24.240]  So this article comes from...
[21:24.240 --> 21:25.240]  Where is this?
[21:25.240 --> 21:27.240]  This is actually from krctv.com,
[21:27.240 --> 21:28.240]  which is a TV station
[21:28.240 --> 21:30.240]  in Southern California.
[21:30.240 --> 21:32.240]  And there is no...
[21:32.240 --> 21:33.240]  Let's see.
[21:33.240 --> 21:34.240]  Megan Hunt is the author.
[21:34.240 --> 21:35.240]  So let's read this article.
[21:35.240 --> 21:36.240]  It says,
[21:36.240 --> 21:37.240]  federal agents raided
[21:37.240 --> 21:38.240]  what appeared to be
[21:38.240 --> 21:39.240]  a large-scale commercial marijuana grow
[21:39.240 --> 21:41.240]  on the Pit River XL Reservation
[21:41.240 --> 21:43.240]  and the Alturas Reservation
[21:43.240 --> 21:44.240]  in Modoc County
[21:44.240 --> 21:45.240]  on Wednesday morning.
[21:45.240 --> 21:46.240]  Photos from the scene
[21:46.320 --> 21:48.320]  show dozens of law enforcement vehicles
[21:48.320 --> 21:49.320]  at a large greenhouse site.
[21:49.320 --> 21:50.320]  There is also one photo
[21:50.320 --> 21:51.320]  of a bulldozer
[21:51.320 --> 21:52.320]  with what appears to be
[21:52.320 --> 21:53.320]  a load of marijuana plants
[21:53.320 --> 21:55.320]  in its bucket.
[21:55.320 --> 21:56.320]  According to Lauren Horwood
[21:56.320 --> 21:58.320]  of the U.S. Attorney's Office,
[21:58.320 --> 21:59.320]  special agents
[21:59.320 --> 22:00.320]  with the Bureau of Indian Affairs
[22:00.320 --> 22:02.320]  and the Drug Enforcement Administration
[22:02.320 --> 22:03.320]  and other federal states
[22:03.320 --> 22:04.320]  and local agencies
[22:04.320 --> 22:05.320]  conducted a search
[22:05.320 --> 22:06.320]  of two large-scale
[22:06.320 --> 22:08.320]  marijuana cultivation facilities
[22:08.320 --> 22:10.320]  located on federally recognized
[22:10.320 --> 22:11.320]  tribal lands
[22:11.320 --> 22:13.320]  at the Alturas Indian Ranch Area
[22:13.320 --> 22:15.320]  and the XL Ranch.
[22:15.400 --> 22:16.400]  At both sites,
[22:16.400 --> 22:17.400]  law enforcement seized
[22:17.400 --> 22:18.400]  a total of at least
[22:18.400 --> 22:20.400]  12,000 marijuana plants
[22:20.400 --> 22:21.400]  and over 100 pounds
[22:21.400 --> 22:22.400]  of processed marijuana.
[22:22.400 --> 22:24.400]  Other than the contraband marijuana
[22:24.400 --> 22:26.400]  and items of evidentiary value,
[22:26.400 --> 22:28.400]  no tribal property was seized
[22:28.400 --> 22:29.400]  and no federal charges
[22:29.400 --> 22:30.400]  are pending, Horwood said.
[22:30.400 --> 22:31.400]  She explained that
[22:31.400 --> 22:32.400]  the search warrants
[22:32.400 --> 22:33.400]  are part of an ongoing
[22:33.400 --> 22:34.400]  investigation relating
[22:34.400 --> 22:35.400]  to the financing and management
[22:35.400 --> 22:36.400]  of a commercial marijuana
[22:36.400 --> 22:38.400]  cultivation project.
[22:38.400 --> 22:40.400]  The project warrant affidavits
[22:40.400 --> 22:42.400]  were unsealed until today.
[22:42.400 --> 22:43.400]  Horwood also said
[22:43.400 --> 22:44.400]  that while the U.S. Attorney's Office
[22:44.480 --> 22:45.480]  doesn't normally comment
[22:45.480 --> 22:46.480]  on ongoing investigations,
[22:46.480 --> 22:47.480]  because of the public nature
[22:47.480 --> 22:48.480]  of this raid,
[22:48.480 --> 22:49.480]  they are releasing information.
[22:49.480 --> 22:50.480]  She explained that
[22:50.480 --> 22:51.480]  marijuana growers
[22:51.480 --> 22:52.480]  have received substantial
[22:52.480 --> 22:53.480]  attention in Modoc County
[22:53.480 --> 22:54.480]  as well as the U.S. Department
[22:54.480 --> 22:55.480]  of Justice's guidance
[22:55.480 --> 22:56.480]  relating to marijuana
[22:56.480 --> 22:58.480]  cultivation on tribal lands.
[22:58.480 --> 22:59.480]  The cultivation facility
[22:59.480 --> 23:00.480]  at Alturas Indian Ranch Area
[23:00.480 --> 23:01.480]  was located within
[23:01.480 --> 23:02.480]  the tribe's
[23:02.480 --> 23:03.480]  former event center
[23:03.480 --> 23:04.480]  within approximately
[23:04.480 --> 23:05.480]  100 yards
[23:05.480 --> 23:06.480]  of the tribe's
[23:06.480 --> 23:07.480]  publicly operated
[23:07.480 --> 23:08.480]  gaming facility
[23:08.480 --> 23:09.480]  at the Desert Forest Ranch.
[23:09.480 --> 23:10.480]  The tribe's former
[23:10.480 --> 23:11.480]  event center
[23:11.480 --> 23:12.480]  was located
[23:12.480 --> 23:13.480]  within the tribe's
[23:13.560 --> 23:14.560]  publicly operated
[23:14.560 --> 23:15.560]  gaming facility
[23:15.560 --> 23:16.560]  at the Desert Rose Casino.
[23:16.560 --> 23:17.560]  So these guys
[23:17.560 --> 23:18.560]  were growing a major grow
[23:18.560 --> 23:19.560]  100 yards
[23:19.560 --> 23:20.560]  from the Desert Rose Casino
[23:20.560 --> 23:21.560]  where people go all day
[23:21.560 --> 23:22.560]  and gamble all day.
[23:22.560 --> 23:24.560]  That's kind of funny to me.
[23:24.560 --> 23:25.560]  The facility on the XL Ranch
[23:25.560 --> 23:26.560]  was next to
[23:26.560 --> 23:27.560]  Highway 395
[23:27.560 --> 23:29.560]  on the banks of the Pitt River.
[23:29.560 --> 23:30.560]  Horwood explained
[23:30.560 --> 23:31.560]  that the Pitt River facility
[23:31.560 --> 23:32.560]  consisted of 40
[23:32.560 --> 23:33.560]  newly constructed
[23:33.560 --> 23:34.560]  greenhouse structures
[23:34.560 --> 23:35.560]  each capable
[23:35.560 --> 23:36.560]  of accommodating
[23:36.560 --> 23:37.560]  approximately 1,000
[23:37.560 --> 23:38.560]  marijuana plants
[23:38.560 --> 23:39.560]  and additional
[23:39.560 --> 23:40.560]  gable roof structures
[23:40.560 --> 23:41.560]  that boosted
[23:41.560 --> 23:42.560]  the square footage
[23:42.640 --> 23:43.640]  of roof covered structures
[23:43.640 --> 23:45.640]  by another 50%.
[23:45.640 --> 23:46.640]  That is a lot of plants
[23:46.640 --> 23:47.640]  you guys.
[23:47.640 --> 23:48.640]  This dude had 40 green
[23:48.640 --> 23:49.640]  or this operation
[23:49.640 --> 23:50.640]  had 40 greenhouses
[23:50.640 --> 23:52.640]  with 1,000 plants each.
[23:52.640 --> 23:53.640]  That's the potential
[23:53.640 --> 23:54.640]  of 40,000 plants
[23:54.640 --> 23:55.640]  in those greenhouses
[23:55.640 --> 23:56.640]  plus stuff
[23:56.640 --> 23:57.640]  that was covered
[23:57.640 --> 23:58.640]  that increases
[23:58.640 --> 23:59.640]  their square footage
[23:59.640 --> 24:00.640]  by 50%
[24:00.640 --> 24:01.640]  which is another 20,000 plants
[24:01.640 --> 24:02.640]  if you do it mathematically
[24:02.640 --> 24:03.640]  I think.
[24:03.640 --> 24:04.640]  Alright, I'll keep going.
[24:04.640 --> 24:05.640]  Both of the grow operations
[24:05.640 --> 24:06.640]  which appear to have been
[24:06.640 --> 24:07.640]  operating in conjunction
[24:07.640 --> 24:08.640]  with each other
[24:08.640 --> 24:09.640]  and were in excess
[24:09.640 --> 24:10.640]  of the locally enacted
[24:10.640 --> 24:11.640]  marijuana cultivation
[24:11.720 --> 24:12.720]  limits applicable
[24:12.720 --> 24:13.720]  to county land
[24:13.720 --> 24:14.720]  Horwood said.
[24:14.720 --> 24:15.720]  I feel like I read
[24:15.720 --> 24:16.720]  something of that.
[24:16.720 --> 24:17.720]  They were both in excess
[24:17.720 --> 24:18.720]  of the locally enacted
[24:18.720 --> 24:19.720]  marijuana cultivation limits.
[24:19.720 --> 24:20.720]  So that's something
[24:20.720 --> 24:21.720]  that's kind of
[24:21.720 --> 24:22.720]  if you're allowed
[24:22.720 --> 24:23.720]  to grow cannabis
[24:23.720 --> 24:24.720]  if you're able
[24:24.720 --> 24:25.720]  to do that legally
[24:25.720 --> 24:26.720]  without being fucked
[24:26.720 --> 24:27.720]  with by the government
[24:27.720 --> 24:28.720]  stay within your damn limits.
[24:28.720 --> 24:29.720]  Why don't you just
[24:29.720 --> 24:30.720]  stay in the limits?
[24:30.720 --> 24:31.720]  These guys were over
[24:31.720 --> 24:32.720]  their limits.
[24:32.720 --> 24:33.720]  They're growing too much
[24:33.720 --> 24:34.720]  and that's what
[24:34.720 --> 24:35.720]  got them in trouble
[24:35.720 --> 24:36.720]  which is a sign of greed
[24:36.720 --> 24:37.720]  and selfishness
[24:37.720 --> 24:38.720]  and not growing
[24:38.720 --> 24:39.720]  from your heart
[24:39.720 --> 24:40.720]  and growing from your wallet.
[24:40.800 --> 24:41.800]  All right, we're going
[24:41.800 --> 24:42.800]  to keep going on the article.
[24:42.800 --> 24:43.800]  It says the volume
[24:43.800 --> 24:44.800]  of marijuana
[24:44.800 --> 24:45.800]  that the XL facility alone
[24:45.800 --> 24:46.800]  was capable of producing
[24:46.800 --> 24:47.800]  estimated approximately
[24:47.800 --> 24:50.800]  40 to 60,000 plants
[24:50.800 --> 24:52.800]  far exceeds any prior known
[24:52.800 --> 24:53.800]  commercial marijuana
[24:53.800 --> 24:54.800]  grow operation
[24:54.800 --> 24:55.800]  anywhere within the 34
[24:55.800 --> 24:56.800]  county eastern district
[24:56.800 --> 24:57.800]  she added.
[24:58.800 --> 24:59.800]  According to tribal
[24:59.800 --> 25:00.800]  representatives
[25:00.800 --> 25:01.800]  all of the marijuana
[25:01.800 --> 25:02.800]  cultivated at both
[25:02.800 --> 25:03.800]  facilities was intended
[25:03.800 --> 25:04.800]  to be distributed
[25:04.800 --> 25:05.800]  off of tribal lands
[25:05.800 --> 25:06.800]  at various unidentified
[25:06.800 --> 25:07.800]  locations according
[25:07.800 --> 25:08.800]  to the search warrant affidavits
[25:08.800 --> 25:09.800]  the entire facility
[25:09.880 --> 25:10.880]  the investigation
[25:10.880 --> 25:11.880]  to date indicates
[25:11.880 --> 25:12.880]  both operations
[25:12.880 --> 25:13.880]  may have been financed
[25:13.880 --> 25:14.880]  by a third party
[25:14.880 --> 25:15.880]  foreign national.
[25:15.880 --> 25:16.880]  And you guys
[25:16.880 --> 25:17.880]  I actually
[25:17.880 --> 25:18.880]  found the search warrants
[25:18.880 --> 25:19.880]  on Facebook
[25:19.880 --> 25:20.880]  for some reason
[25:20.880 --> 25:21.880]  I was scrolling
[25:21.880 --> 25:22.880]  through Facebook
[25:22.880 --> 25:23.880]  and somebody happened
[25:23.880 --> 25:24.880]  to post the search warrants
[25:24.880 --> 25:25.880]  and for some reason
[25:25.880 --> 25:26.880]  I was completely enthralled
[25:26.880 --> 25:27.880]  with reading these search warrants
[25:27.880 --> 25:28.880]  and it was completely
[25:28.880 --> 25:29.880]  entertaining for some reason
[25:29.880 --> 25:30.880]  I could not get
[25:30.880 --> 25:31.880]  my head out of it
[25:31.880 --> 25:32.880]  but they said that
[25:32.880 --> 25:33.880]  this third party
[25:33.880 --> 25:34.880]  foreign national
[25:34.880 --> 25:35.880]  was a guy from Canada
[25:35.880 --> 25:36.880]  who owns Canadian
[25:36.880 --> 25:37.880]  cigarette companies
[25:37.880 --> 25:38.880]  and he was
[25:38.960 --> 25:39.960]  one of the Canadian
[25:39.960 --> 25:40.960]  cigarette companies
[25:40.960 --> 25:41.960]  who has got a history
[25:41.960 --> 25:42.960]  of drug convictions
[25:42.960 --> 25:43.960]  so they got a Canadian
[25:43.960 --> 25:44.960]  guy coming to
[25:44.960 --> 25:45.960]  an Indian reservation
[25:45.960 --> 25:46.960]  who financed
[25:46.960 --> 25:47.960]  a major grow
[25:47.960 --> 25:48.960]  he paid for everything
[25:48.960 --> 25:49.960]  they were supposed
[25:49.960 --> 25:50.960]  to grow the cannabis
[25:50.960 --> 25:51.960]  distribute this
[25:51.960 --> 25:52.960]  and allegedly get him
[25:52.960 --> 25:53.960]  his portion
[25:53.960 --> 25:54.960]  and keep the operation going
[25:54.960 --> 25:55.960]  I was amazed
[25:55.960 --> 25:56.960]  that I found
[25:56.960 --> 25:57.960]  the search warrants
[25:57.960 --> 25:58.960]  and all of the stuff
[25:58.960 --> 25:59.960]  written up
[25:59.960 --> 26:00.960]  if you guys ever
[26:00.960 --> 26:01.960]  get a chance to read
[26:01.960 --> 26:02.960]  a technical document
[26:02.960 --> 26:03.960]  like that
[26:03.960 --> 26:04.960]  do it just for fun
[26:04.960 --> 26:05.960]  if you're one of
[26:05.960 --> 26:06.960]  those kind of people
[26:06.960 --> 26:07.960]  some people are
[26:08.040 --> 26:09.040]  it was really neat
[26:09.040 --> 26:10.040]  they will not give
[26:10.040 --> 26:11.040]  the snitches names
[26:11.040 --> 26:12.040]  they call them
[26:12.040 --> 26:13.040]  confidential informants
[26:13.040 --> 26:14.040]  and give a long excuse
[26:14.040 --> 26:15.040]  why they keep them
[26:15.040 --> 26:16.040]  confidential
[26:16.040 --> 26:17.040]  they talk about
[26:17.040 --> 26:18.040]  how the raid happened
[26:18.040 --> 26:19.040]  they talk about
[26:19.040 --> 26:20.040]  so many small details
[26:20.040 --> 26:21.040]  you guys will start
[26:21.040 --> 26:22.040]  tripping out
[26:22.040 --> 26:23.040]  and wondering
[26:23.040 --> 26:24.040]  if you're being watched
[26:24.040 --> 26:25.040]  when you listen
[26:25.040 --> 26:26.040]  if you read a search warrant
[26:26.040 --> 26:27.040]  because there are
[26:27.040 --> 26:28.040]  so many small details
[26:28.040 --> 26:29.040]  that these guys
[26:29.040 --> 26:30.040]  fucked up on
[26:30.040 --> 26:31.040]  they were getting
[26:31.040 --> 26:32.040]  their pictures taken
[26:32.040 --> 26:33.040]  they were talking to people
[26:33.040 --> 26:34.040]  and all of that shit
[26:34.040 --> 26:35.040]  is in the police reports
[26:35.040 --> 26:36.040]  and in the search warrants
[26:36.040 --> 26:37.040]  and you would never assume
[26:37.120 --> 26:38.120]  if it was
[26:38.120 --> 26:39.120]  yeah
[26:39.120 --> 26:40.120]  alright
[26:40.120 --> 26:41.120]  I'm going to continue
[26:41.120 --> 26:42.120]  with the article
[26:42.120 --> 26:43.120]  if I can find out
[26:43.120 --> 26:44.120]  where the hell I was
[26:44.120 --> 26:45.120]  alright here we go
[26:45.120 --> 26:46.120]  according to Horwood
[26:46.120 --> 26:47.120]  the investigation
[26:47.120 --> 26:48.120]  of the cultivation
[26:48.120 --> 26:49.120]  facility search date
[26:49.120 --> 26:50.120]  indicates that both
[26:50.120 --> 26:51.120]  are commercial
[26:51.120 --> 26:52.120]  marijuana cultivation
[26:52.120 --> 26:53.120]  projects operated
[26:53.120 --> 26:54.120]  with the intent
[26:54.120 --> 26:55.120]  to transport large
[26:55.120 --> 26:56.120]  quantities of marijuana
[26:56.120 --> 26:57.120]  off tribal lands
[26:57.120 --> 26:58.120]  for distribution
[26:58.120 --> 26:59.120]  at various locations
[26:59.120 --> 27:00.120]  yet to be identified
[27:00.120 --> 27:01.120]  by the tribes
[27:01.120 --> 27:02.120]  which is a concern
[27:02.120 --> 27:03.120]  to the department of justice
[27:03.120 --> 27:04.120]  because it goes
[27:04.120 --> 27:05.120]  against their guidelines
[27:05.120 --> 27:06.120]  you know why it goes
[27:06.200 --> 27:07.200]  Horwood said
[27:07.200 --> 27:08.200]  that the U.S. Attorney's
[27:08.200 --> 27:09.200]  office consulted
[27:09.200 --> 27:10.200]  with members
[27:10.200 --> 27:11.200]  and representatives
[27:11.200 --> 27:12.200]  of both tribes
[27:12.200 --> 27:13.200]  which are federally
[27:13.200 --> 27:14.200]  recognized
[27:14.200 --> 27:15.200]  on multiple occasions
[27:15.200 --> 27:16.200]  before today's raid
[27:16.200 --> 27:17.200]  and reminded the tribes
[27:17.200 --> 27:18.200]  that cultivation of marijuana
[27:18.200 --> 27:19.200]  is illegal under federal law
[27:19.200 --> 27:20.200]  and that anyone engaging
[27:20.200 --> 27:21.200]  in such activity
[27:21.200 --> 27:22.200]  did so at the risk
[27:22.200 --> 27:23.200]  of enforcement action
[27:23.200 --> 27:24.200]  she added
[27:24.200 --> 27:25.200]  they were also concerned
[27:25.200 --> 27:26.200]  because the large quantities
[27:26.200 --> 27:27.200]  violates federal law
[27:27.200 --> 27:28.200]  it is not consistent
[27:28.200 --> 27:29.200]  with California's
[27:29.200 --> 27:30.200]  compassionate use act
[27:30.200 --> 27:31.200]  and undermines
[27:31.200 --> 27:32.200]  locally enacted
[27:32.200 --> 27:33.200]  marijuana regulations
[27:33.200 --> 27:34.200]  so basically
[27:34.200 --> 27:35.200]  you guys
[27:35.280 --> 27:36.280]  these guys got
[27:36.280 --> 27:37.280]  fucked because
[27:37.280 --> 27:38.280]  the tribal laws
[27:38.280 --> 27:39.280]  and the locals
[27:39.280 --> 27:40.280]  said you guys
[27:40.280 --> 27:41.280]  are growing too much weed
[27:41.280 --> 27:42.280]  you're going to get
[27:42.280 --> 27:43.280]  in trouble
[27:43.280 --> 27:44.280]  and guess what
[27:44.280 --> 27:45.280]  they went ahead
[27:45.280 --> 27:46.280]  and did it
[27:46.280 --> 27:47.280]  and guess what
[27:47.280 --> 27:48.280]  they got dealt
[27:48.280 --> 27:49.280]  with by the police
[27:49.280 --> 27:50.280]  it's a little bit ridiculous
[27:50.280 --> 27:51.280]  don't fuck around
[27:51.280 --> 27:52.280]  you guys
[27:52.280 --> 27:53.280]  if you're allowed
[27:53.280 --> 27:54.280]  to grow cannabis
[27:54.280 --> 27:55.280]  if you're a native
[27:55.280 --> 27:56.280]  if you're not a native
[27:56.280 --> 27:57.280]  whoever you are
[27:57.280 --> 27:58.280]  if you're allowed
[27:58.280 --> 27:59.280]  to grow cannabis
[27:59.280 --> 28:00.280]  don't throw it
[28:00.280 --> 28:01.280]  in their face
[28:01.280 --> 28:02.280]  and grow too much
[28:02.280 --> 28:03.280]  just follow the rules
[28:03.280 --> 28:04.280]  grow what you're
[28:04.360 --> 28:05.360]  allowed to do
[28:05.360 --> 28:06.360]  but if you're in
[28:06.360 --> 28:07.360]  a non-legal state
[28:07.360 --> 28:08.360]  and you need medicine
[28:08.360 --> 28:09.360]  grow what you can
[28:09.360 --> 28:10.360]  do what you can
[28:10.360 --> 28:11.360]  be careful
[28:11.360 --> 28:12.360]  don't get caught
[28:12.360 --> 28:13.360]  alright
[28:13.360 --> 28:14.360]  in the search warrant
[28:14.360 --> 28:15.360]  that I read you guys
[28:15.360 --> 28:16.360]  they listed all of the
[28:16.360 --> 28:17.360]  strains that these guys
[28:17.360 --> 28:18.360]  were working with
[28:18.360 --> 28:19.360]  because they
[28:19.360 --> 28:20.360]  the way that a lot
[28:20.360 --> 28:21.360]  of this started
[28:21.360 --> 28:22.360]  they pulled over
[28:22.360 --> 28:23.360]  one of their
[28:23.360 --> 28:24.360]  transportation vehicles
[28:24.360 --> 28:25.360]  that was transporting
[28:25.360 --> 28:26.360]  plants from one
[28:26.360 --> 28:27.360]  growth facility
[28:27.360 --> 28:28.360]  to the other
[28:28.360 --> 28:29.360]  and this guy
[28:29.360 --> 28:30.360]  had a thousand
[28:30.360 --> 28:31.360]  one gallon pots
[28:31.360 --> 28:32.360]  with babies
[28:32.360 --> 28:33.360]  in his rider truck
[28:33.440 --> 28:34.440]  they had platinum
[28:34.440 --> 28:35.440]  OG in there
[28:35.440 --> 28:36.440]  they had girl scout
[28:36.440 --> 28:37.440]  cookies
[28:37.440 --> 28:38.440]  these guys had
[28:38.440 --> 28:39.440]  some great cuts
[28:39.440 --> 28:40.440]  and I started
[28:40.440 --> 28:41.440]  thinking about it
[28:41.440 --> 28:42.440]  natives
[28:42.440 --> 28:43.440]  the natives
[28:43.440 --> 28:44.440]  people we used to
[28:44.440 --> 28:45.440]  call Indians
[28:45.440 --> 28:46.440]  when we were kids
[28:46.440 --> 28:47.440]  those guys are
[28:47.440 --> 28:48.440]  an agricultural
[28:48.440 --> 28:49.440]  community
[28:49.440 --> 28:50.440]  culture
[28:50.440 --> 28:51.440]  all of their culture
[28:51.440 --> 28:52.440]  is based on the earth
[28:52.440 --> 28:53.440]  and agriculture
[28:53.440 --> 28:54.440]  if these natives
[28:54.440 --> 28:55.440]  that were growing
[28:55.440 --> 28:56.440]  these cannabis plants
[28:56.440 --> 28:57.440]  were the natives
[28:57.440 --> 28:58.440]  that we think of
[28:58.440 --> 28:59.440]  when we daydream
[28:59.440 --> 29:00.440]  about Indians
[29:00.440 --> 29:01.440]  those guys in my mind
[29:01.440 --> 29:02.440]  would grow amazing
[29:02.520 --> 29:03.520]  cannabis
[29:03.520 --> 29:04.520]  and I would love
[29:04.520 --> 29:05.520]  to have gotten
[29:05.520 --> 29:06.520]  a sample of the
[29:06.520 --> 29:07.520]  shit that they grew
[29:07.520 --> 29:08.520]  I'd love to see
[29:08.520 --> 29:09.520]  what the natives
[29:09.520 --> 29:10.520]  are growing
[29:10.520 --> 29:11.520]  I bet it's
[29:11.520 --> 29:12.520]  fucking dank
[29:12.520 --> 29:13.520]  just because
[29:13.520 --> 29:14.520]  that's what they do
[29:14.520 --> 29:15.520]  they're outdoor people
[29:15.520 --> 29:16.520]  they're connected
[29:16.520 --> 29:17.520]  with the earth
[29:17.520 --> 29:18.520]  they're connected
[29:18.520 --> 29:19.520]  with plants
[29:19.520 --> 29:20.520]  I could assume
[29:20.520 --> 29:21.520]  that they grow
[29:21.520 --> 29:22.520]  some dank dank weed
[29:22.520 --> 29:23.520]  sounds like they're
[29:23.520 --> 29:24.520]  putting out a lot
[29:24.520 --> 29:25.520]  of it too
[29:25.520 --> 29:26.520]  alright
[29:26.520 --> 29:27.520]  what else do we have
[29:27.520 --> 29:28.520]  um I think that's
[29:28.520 --> 29:29.520]  all the news
[29:29.520 --> 29:30.520]  we're gonna do
[29:30.520 --> 29:31.520]  because we're at
[29:31.600 --> 29:32.600]  the end of a podcast
[29:32.600 --> 29:33.600]  they may get skipped
[29:33.600 --> 29:34.600]  you never know
[29:34.600 --> 29:35.600]  how we're gonna do
[29:35.600 --> 29:36.600]  it around here
[29:36.600 --> 29:37.600]  so it's time to start
[29:37.600 --> 29:38.600]  wrapping up the show
[29:38.600 --> 29:39.600]  but before I do that
