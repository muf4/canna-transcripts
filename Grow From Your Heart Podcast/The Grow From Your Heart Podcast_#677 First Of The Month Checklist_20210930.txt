[00:00.250 --> 00:13.050]  Alright, here we go.
[00:13.050 --> 00:14.690]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:14.690 --> 00:21.330]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 677 of the Grow From Your
[00:21.330 --> 00:22.990]  Heart Podcast.
[00:22.990 --> 00:25.890]  In this episode, I'm going to go over a little checklist I've created.
[00:26.210 --> 00:30.350]  I've got a list of things that can help us keep our plants and our garden and our equipment
[00:30.350 --> 00:32.190]  in top working order.
[00:32.190 --> 00:36.030]  Before I get to that list, let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great folks who
[00:36.030 --> 00:38.570]  support the show on Patreon.
[00:38.570 --> 00:42.510]  Let's start off with a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out to Red Eyed
[00:42.510 --> 00:43.670]  Optimist.
[00:43.670 --> 00:46.130]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Mr. Mean Green.
[00:46.130 --> 00:49.470]  I want to send a fist bump and a thank you shout out to Rasta Green Thumb.
[00:49.470 --> 00:51.630]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Brendan Grows.
[00:51.630 --> 00:55.310]  I want to send a big thank you shout out to a longtime supporter, my buddy Made While
[00:55.310 --> 00:56.310]  Medicated.
[00:56.310 --> 00:58.070]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Luke.
[00:58.070 --> 01:01.710]  I want to send a fist bump and a thank you shout out to Thomas M. Let's send a big high
[01:01.710 --> 01:05.910]  five and a thank you shout out to a longtime supporter, my buddy Godfather Kush.
[01:05.910 --> 01:09.790]  Let's send a thank you shout out to another longtime supporter, Zaxxon Starker.
[01:09.790 --> 01:12.190]  Let's not forget about my buddy Captain Mojo.
[01:12.190 --> 01:16.930]  Then let's wrap it all up with a big thank you shout out to my buddy Mobius Grows.
[01:16.930 --> 01:21.730]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:21.730 --> 01:25.410]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:25.410 --> 01:31.810]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:31.810 --> 01:35.070]  All of the information you need is right there on the screen and you know I do include a
[01:35.070 --> 01:41.890]  link in the show notes and in the video description to make it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:41.890 --> 01:45.690]  Speaking of show notes and video descriptions, this is the part of the show where I invite
[01:45.690 --> 01:49.130]  you to join the iRegenetics Discord server.
[01:49.130 --> 01:54.090]  There are approximately 1,500 members of the iRegenetics Discord server and honestly, I
[01:54.090 --> 01:56.090]  don't know why you were missing the party.
[01:56.090 --> 01:57.090]  Join us.
[01:57.090 --> 01:58.090]  It's a good time.
[01:58.090 --> 01:59.090]  It's a party.
[01:59.090 --> 02:00.810]  There are a lot of great things going on on the Discord server.
[02:00.810 --> 02:02.450]  We are doing actions and waffles.
[02:02.450 --> 02:05.370]  Today somebody got a great pack of unreleased seeds.
[02:05.370 --> 02:08.610]  They've got a one of one pack, some seeds that have never been released.
[02:08.610 --> 02:09.970]  They've got the only pack so far.
[02:09.970 --> 02:12.990]  They got that on the Discord on a waffle there.
[02:12.990 --> 02:16.410]  The only way to get access to that was the Discord server.
[02:16.410 --> 02:17.410]  Join us on the Discord.
[02:17.410 --> 02:18.490]  I talk about it a lot.
[02:18.490 --> 02:19.490]  There are actions.
[02:19.490 --> 02:21.090]  There are waffles happening.
[02:21.090 --> 02:22.730]  There is yoga going on.
[02:22.730 --> 02:24.090]  There is grow talk happening.
[02:24.090 --> 02:28.010]  There's help and advice and just random hanging out over on the Discord.
[02:28.010 --> 02:29.010]  I do invite you.
[02:29.010 --> 02:30.010]  Join me.
[02:30.010 --> 02:32.310]  There's a link of course in the show notes and the video description.
[02:32.310 --> 02:34.970]  I do look forward to seeing you on the Discord server.
[02:34.970 --> 02:36.990]  I will be there as soon as I'm done recording.
[02:36.990 --> 02:40.770]  It takes a little while for that file from that camera and that camera to load up into
[02:40.770 --> 02:41.770]  the computer.
[02:41.770 --> 02:45.230]  Once that's done loading, I go take dabs in the Discord server with the crew.
[02:45.230 --> 02:47.750]  So that's my way of winding down and hanging out.
[02:47.750 --> 02:48.750]  Join me.
[02:48.750 --> 02:49.750]  I might be there when you pop in.
[02:49.750 --> 02:50.750]  All right.
[02:50.750 --> 02:53.330]  That's enough rambling about the Discord server.
[02:53.330 --> 02:54.930]  What else do we want to talk about?
[02:54.930 --> 02:56.910]  Let's get right into the main topic of this show.
[02:56.910 --> 02:57.910]  We've been talking enough.
[02:57.910 --> 02:59.390]  Let's get right to the main part.
[02:59.390 --> 03:01.310]  This show will come out right before the first.
[03:01.310 --> 03:04.910]  I think it actually comes out on the 31st if there are that many days this month.
[03:04.910 --> 03:06.070]  I didn't keep good count.
[03:06.070 --> 03:08.690]  We should be right about the first as this episode comes out.
[03:08.690 --> 03:12.090]  As many people listen to this episode, it will be the first of the month.
[03:12.090 --> 03:16.490]  This is a good time to run through a checklist of things in our garden to make sure that
[03:16.490 --> 03:19.070]  everything is in top working condition.
[03:19.070 --> 03:21.190]  A lot of things get overlooked.
[03:21.190 --> 03:22.190]  We get busy.
[03:22.190 --> 03:23.190]  I'm extremely busy.
[03:23.190 --> 03:24.190]  It is outdoor season.
[03:24.190 --> 03:25.770]  It is harvest season.
[03:25.770 --> 03:30.270]  We're shifting from the summer to the fall, from the warm to the cold is what I call it.
[03:30.270 --> 03:33.350]  So we've got to rebuild all the indoor grows.
[03:33.350 --> 03:35.250]  It is harvest time for the outdoor season.
[03:35.250 --> 03:36.970]  They're going to be a lot of seeds to shuck.
[03:36.970 --> 03:38.550]  It is going to be busy.
[03:39.410 --> 03:40.990]  When you get that busy, a lot of things get overlooked.
[03:40.990 --> 03:43.870]  I always say that there's that one corner that doesn't get swept.
[03:43.870 --> 03:45.910]  There's always that one tray that doesn't get washed.
[03:45.910 --> 03:48.190]  There's that one plant in the back that gets ignored.
[03:48.190 --> 03:52.750]  It is now time to make sure we get to all those small details because over time they
[03:52.750 --> 03:55.710]  will build up and that's what causes us problems.
[03:55.710 --> 03:57.110]  Stay on top of your shit.
[03:57.110 --> 03:59.590]  So my point is it is the first of the month.
[03:59.590 --> 04:01.870]  It is a good time to go through the checklist.
[04:01.870 --> 04:02.870]  It's also payday.
[04:02.870 --> 04:07.310]  So you should have a few bucks to handle any supplies or corrections that need to be made.
[04:07.350 --> 04:10.990]  And if not, now's the time to start thinking about budgeting more properly for the grow
[04:10.990 --> 04:16.310]  because shit will come up, things will go awry, and we've got to return money into our
[04:16.310 --> 04:19.270]  investment if we want it to keep returning for us.
[04:19.270 --> 04:21.510]  All right, let me get myself back on track.
[04:21.510 --> 04:22.690]  First of the month update.
[04:22.690 --> 04:23.690]  The first of the month.
[04:23.690 --> 04:27.190]  The first thing I would think about is clean everything.
[04:27.190 --> 04:28.750]  Clean everything.
[04:28.750 --> 04:32.470]  Everything in the grow space, everything outside the grow space, everything involved in the
[04:32.470 --> 04:33.470]  grow.
[04:33.470 --> 04:34.470]  It is time to clean it.
[04:34.470 --> 04:35.470]  Let's clean.
[04:35.630 --> 04:38.310]  Let's clean the lights with the glass reflection, with the glass space there.
[04:38.310 --> 04:39.310]  Let's clean that glass.
[04:39.310 --> 04:43.510]  If you've got air conditioners, if you've got fans, let's clean all of that stuff.
[04:43.510 --> 04:44.510]  Clean everything.
[04:44.510 --> 04:45.510]  You know it needs to be cleaned.
[04:45.510 --> 04:46.510]  It is your facility.
[04:46.510 --> 04:47.510]  It's your grow.
[04:47.510 --> 04:48.510]  It's your space.
[04:48.510 --> 04:49.510]  Clean it.
[04:49.510 --> 04:50.510]  Start at the ceiling.
[04:50.510 --> 04:51.710]  Work your way all the way down to the floor.
[04:51.710 --> 04:52.830]  Clean the floor.
[04:52.830 --> 04:53.910]  Clean the tops of the lights.
[04:53.910 --> 04:55.590]  The tops of my lights get really dusty.
[04:55.590 --> 04:56.870]  I've got some HPS lights.
[04:56.870 --> 04:58.030]  They're big squares.
[04:58.030 --> 05:00.230]  The top of that gets really dusty up there.
[05:00.230 --> 05:01.230]  Clean that shit.
[05:01.230 --> 05:03.230]  If you've got LED lights, turn off the lights.
[05:03.230 --> 05:04.970]  If you're going to clean your lights, let them cool.
[05:04.970 --> 05:06.010]  That's a quick disclaimer.
[05:06.010 --> 05:08.430]  Let the lights cool down before you clean them.
[05:08.430 --> 05:09.430]  Clean all the glass.
[05:09.430 --> 05:11.610]  If you've got LEDs, clean the diodes really carefully.
[05:11.610 --> 05:13.570]  I don't know how you do that with your lights.
[05:13.570 --> 05:17.930]  Read the instructions, but it may be time to clean your lights and your equipment.
[05:17.930 --> 05:19.290]  I had some fungus gnats.
[05:19.290 --> 05:21.830]  A buddy gave me a clone, and it came with free fungus gnats.
[05:21.830 --> 05:22.830]  My fault.
[05:22.830 --> 05:24.370]  Should have quarantined that sucker better.
[05:24.370 --> 05:28.170]  But around my grow light, there are a bunch of fungus gnats right around the LED bulbs.
[05:28.170 --> 05:32.010]  I had to get some Q-tips and some rubbing alcohol and clean out all the dead fungus
[05:32.010 --> 05:33.010]  gnats.
[05:33.010 --> 05:34.930]  There's a lot of stuff like that that will need to be done.
[05:34.930 --> 05:36.050]  Clean everything.
[05:36.050 --> 05:38.130]  That thing you've been avoiding, there's something.
[05:38.130 --> 05:42.410]  We've all got that one area, that one little thing that's a pain in the ass to clean.
[05:42.410 --> 05:43.410]  Clean it.
[05:43.410 --> 05:44.410]  Now's the time.
[05:44.410 --> 05:45.410]  Just take a moment.
[05:45.410 --> 05:46.410]  Just dedicate that day to it.
[05:46.410 --> 05:47.410]  It is cleaning day.
[05:47.410 --> 05:48.410]  Let's do it.
[05:48.410 --> 05:50.250]  Let's talk about stuff in depth that we should clean.
[05:50.250 --> 05:51.250]  Filters.
[05:51.250 --> 05:52.810]  We often overlook cleaning filters.
[05:52.810 --> 05:55.570]  You've got air conditioner filters that need to be cleaned.
[05:55.570 --> 05:57.490]  Are your carbon filters still working?
[05:57.490 --> 05:59.830]  How long have those carbon filters been around?
[05:59.830 --> 06:01.490]  Do you need to replace them?
[06:01.490 --> 06:05.770]  The next time you replace your carbon filter, get a piece of duct tape and write the date
[06:05.770 --> 06:10.090]  on that duct tape and put that somewhere on your carbon filter just so you can look and
[06:10.090 --> 06:12.250]  say, this has been here for a year.
[06:12.250 --> 06:13.570]  It's almost time to change it.
[06:13.570 --> 06:15.010]  They're supposed to give you two years.
[06:15.010 --> 06:17.250]  They're supposed to be good for two years.
[06:17.250 --> 06:19.370]  Mine don't last that long, which is a compliment.
[06:19.370 --> 06:22.930]  I'm thinking that I'm growing the dank and you can smell it and that carbon filter just
[06:22.930 --> 06:23.930]  ain't working.
[06:23.930 --> 06:27.410]  So I replace it about every year or so, maybe every year and a half, even though you're
[06:27.410 --> 06:29.630]  supposed to get two years.
[06:29.630 --> 06:30.630]  Is it working?
[06:30.770 --> 06:31.770]  Put it aside.
[06:31.770 --> 06:32.770]  Give it a smell.
[06:32.770 --> 06:34.030]  Leave for a little while.
[06:34.030 --> 06:36.150]  Don't come back directly into the grow area.
[06:36.150 --> 06:39.550]  Walk around outside the grow area and see, can you smell it?
[06:39.550 --> 06:40.550]  Bring somebody new.
[06:40.550 --> 06:41.550]  See if they smell it.
[06:41.550 --> 06:45.310]  You've probably gone nose blind and you don't even smell your grow anymore.
[06:45.310 --> 06:46.310]  Let's be safe.
[06:46.310 --> 06:47.590]  Is the carbon filter working?
[06:47.590 --> 06:51.550]  So clean your filters, your air conditioner filters, your carbon filter.
[06:51.550 --> 06:53.670]  What about in your hydro setup?
[06:53.670 --> 06:58.350]  I know when I run a hydro setup, I put a filter that goes from the tank between the tank and
[06:58.350 --> 06:59.350]  the emitters.
[06:59.350 --> 07:00.430]  There is a filter thing.
[07:01.230 --> 07:04.270]  It's like a 45 degree angle that hangs down so that all the heavy shit falls into there
[07:04.270 --> 07:07.430]  as the water passes through the watering system.
[07:07.430 --> 07:10.270]  Has that filter been taken out and cleaned thoroughly?
[07:10.270 --> 07:14.390]  Have you cleaned your hydro lines like the whole system starting from the pump all the
[07:14.390 --> 07:15.650]  way down to the emitters?
[07:15.650 --> 07:20.110]  Maybe just take the emitters out of the plants if you can and just run some sort of cleaner
[07:20.110 --> 07:21.110]  through there.
[07:21.110 --> 07:24.710]  Maybe an enzyme, maybe some Fizan, something just to clean all that shit out of there.
[07:24.710 --> 07:27.850]  You may be surprised what comes out of your watering system.
[07:27.850 --> 07:35.170]  When I build tables with long, big auto watering systems and long PVC pipes and long flex tubes,
[07:35.170 --> 07:39.170]  we make a cap on one end so we can open it and actually blast water through and clean
[07:39.170 --> 07:43.590]  it and you would be amazed at all of the nutrient buildup and all the gunk and junk that builds
[07:43.590 --> 07:48.050]  up inside those lines and you don't know it's there and you're basically feeding the plants
[07:48.050 --> 07:51.010]  that stuff every time you're watering and you don't know it's there.
[07:51.010 --> 07:53.330]  So take a minute, clean out your hydro lines.
[07:53.330 --> 07:56.290]  All that stuff may be built up with gunk.
[07:56.290 --> 07:59.570]  Use an enzyme, an enzymatic product will definitely help break that down.
[07:59.570 --> 08:01.450]  Fizan 20 will push it out.
[08:01.450 --> 08:05.410]  Then make sure you rinse that stuff out of your system, out of the hydro lines, out of
[08:05.410 --> 08:09.770]  all the tubes, out of everything before you put the emitters back in the plants.
[08:09.770 --> 08:14.930]  We don't want to put too much hygrosime or too much Fizan into the plants.
[08:14.930 --> 08:17.770]  The natural part is fine but you don't want to do too much.
[08:17.770 --> 08:20.970]  The cleaning ratio will be stronger than what you're using for feeding.
[08:20.970 --> 08:22.870]  So clean all those tubes.
[08:22.870 --> 08:23.870]  Clean the glass on the lights.
[08:23.870 --> 08:27.670]  I talked about if you have vented lights, clean that glass between the bulb and your
[08:27.670 --> 08:28.670]  canopy.
[08:28.670 --> 08:29.670]  Clean that.
[08:29.670 --> 08:32.590]  That's going to reduce, if that is dirty, that's going to drastically reduce the amount
[08:32.590 --> 08:36.990]  of lumens that make it from the light bulb down to your canopy.
[08:36.990 --> 08:39.190]  That glass is already cutting enough down.
[08:39.190 --> 08:43.930]  Any speck of dirt, any foliar feed, any pesticide spray that gathered on that lens is going
[08:43.930 --> 08:47.070]  to drastically reduce the amount of light that makes it to your canopy.
[08:47.070 --> 08:50.910]  It will drastically reduce light penetration.
[08:50.910 --> 08:54.990]  Speaking of bulbs, how long has it been since you've taken a light meter, a lumen meter,
[08:54.990 --> 08:59.550]  a PAR meter, any sort of meter to your lights to test how much they're putting out.
[08:59.550 --> 09:04.910]  If you're using HPS or metal halides, they put out 100%.
[09:04.910 --> 09:07.910]  You can turn them down but they're still putting out whatever you've got it turned to.
[09:07.910 --> 09:09.990]  It's putting out 100% of that power.
[09:09.990 --> 09:13.910]  Is the bulb giving you 100% of those lumens?
[09:13.910 --> 09:19.730]  My recommendation, when you get a new bulb, get a PAR meter, some sort of a meter, something
[09:19.730 --> 09:22.570]  reliable that you're going to use next time also.
[09:22.570 --> 09:24.810]  A basic lumen meter is perfect.
[09:24.810 --> 09:30.170]  Get a piece of string or a ruler or a tape measure, some way that you can measure consistently.
[09:30.170 --> 09:32.970]  What I'm going to say is get a piece of string about 18 inches long.
[09:32.970 --> 09:34.250]  It's about 18 inches, right?
[09:34.250 --> 09:37.970]  Get a piece of string about 18 inches long and tie it to the end of your lumen meter.
[09:37.970 --> 09:41.330]  Put one end at the light and then hold it the length of that string.
[09:41.330 --> 09:44.010]  Now every time you measure, you're 18 inches from the light.
[09:44.010 --> 09:46.110]  See what the number is on your lumen meter.
[09:46.110 --> 09:47.850]  Write that number down.
[09:48.050 --> 09:51.450]  Every few months, every couple of months, hold that lumen meter up to the light at the
[09:51.450 --> 09:54.270]  same distance and see what number it is showing you.
[09:54.270 --> 09:59.450]  If it's gone down to, if it's 30%, 50% less than what it was showing you, it is definitely
[09:59.450 --> 10:01.370]  time to change that bulb.
[10:01.370 --> 10:06.970]  You're paying for 100% of that electricity and you're getting 50 to 70% of the output
[10:06.970 --> 10:08.210]  from that bulb.
[10:08.210 --> 10:11.530]  If you swap out that bulb, you'll get 100% output again.
[10:11.530 --> 10:13.930]  You'll be getting the electricity that you're paying for.
[10:13.930 --> 10:18.170]  Is the cost of that bulb offsetting the waste of electricity that you're spending?
[10:18.170 --> 10:20.490]  You're pumping the electricity into it.
[10:20.490 --> 10:24.850]  Let's have a bulb that will give us the light that we're paying for, right?
[10:24.850 --> 10:25.850]  Test your bulbs.
[10:25.850 --> 10:26.850]  Mark the date somewhere.
[10:26.850 --> 10:30.730]  When you do get a new bulb, when you do finally replace those bulbs.
[10:30.730 --> 10:34.330]  At the grocery store that I used to shop at a long time ago before things got real busy,
[10:34.330 --> 10:37.490]  when you would buy a new bulb, they would take the bulb out of the box and write the
[10:37.490 --> 10:41.570]  date on the little copper part that screws into the fixture.
[10:41.570 --> 10:44.730]  That was a cool idea, but if I wanted to see the date of my bulb, I had to unscrew
[10:44.730 --> 10:46.210]  it and take it out of there and look.
[10:46.210 --> 10:49.970]  Now I take a piece of duct tape and I write the date that I put a new bulb in my light
[10:49.970 --> 10:53.690]  fixture and I put that duct tape on the light fixture.
[10:53.690 --> 10:55.690]  I want to know when that light went in there.
[10:55.690 --> 10:56.930]  It's printed right there on the light fixture.
[10:56.930 --> 10:58.250]  I just got to look right there.
[10:58.250 --> 11:00.050]  It says that went in January 1st.
[11:00.050 --> 11:02.010]  I got plenty of time on that bulb.
[11:02.010 --> 11:03.010]  Let's measure the lumens.
[11:03.010 --> 11:04.010]  I know how long it's been there.
[11:04.010 --> 11:05.690]  I know how many lumens it's given me.
[11:05.690 --> 11:06.690]  Things are working out.
[11:06.690 --> 11:07.690]  Make some notes.
[11:07.690 --> 11:08.850]  Set yourself up for success.
[11:08.850 --> 11:11.970]  All the notes you make are setting yourself up for success.
[11:11.970 --> 11:12.970]  We smoke.
[11:12.970 --> 11:14.090]  That's why we grow.
[11:14.090 --> 11:15.190]  Most of us are consumers.
[11:15.190 --> 11:16.190]  That's why we grow.
[11:16.190 --> 11:17.730]  That's what inspired us to grow.
[11:17.730 --> 11:21.770]  I really enjoy getting just a nice little buzz, just getting in the zone.
[11:21.770 --> 11:22.770]  You know what I mean?
[11:22.770 --> 11:23.810]  Just a little stony focus.
[11:23.810 --> 11:26.690]  Get baked a little bit and then go in the grow and put on some music and just get in
[11:26.690 --> 11:28.450]  the zone and get work done.
[11:28.450 --> 11:31.090]  But then sometimes I'll come out and be like, I don't even know what I just did for the
[11:31.090 --> 11:32.930]  past four hours in the grow.
[11:32.930 --> 11:33.930]  Make some notes.
[11:33.930 --> 11:35.290]  Do some documentation.
[11:35.290 --> 11:36.890]  Set yourself up for success.
[11:36.890 --> 11:38.610]  Probably if you do something, you got a note.
[11:38.610 --> 11:40.050]  Like, hey, I did this and this and this.
[11:40.050 --> 11:42.810]  And the next time you want to do great results, you got some notes.
[11:42.810 --> 11:44.570]  You say, I did this and this and this.
[11:44.570 --> 11:47.810]  It works just the same when you're marking down your equipment.
[11:47.810 --> 11:49.010]  When did I buy these bulbs?
[11:49.010 --> 11:50.370]  When did I buy this carbon filter?
[11:50.370 --> 11:52.890]  When did I install whatever equipment I'm using?
[11:52.890 --> 11:55.130]  When did I buy that air conditioner?
[11:55.130 --> 11:56.850]  All that stuff, write it down.
[11:56.850 --> 12:01.130]  Keep your receipts also because when shit breaks and you want to argue with them for
[12:01.130 --> 12:03.130]  their warranty, you're going to need that receipt.
[12:03.130 --> 12:04.170]  Where am I on this list?
[12:04.170 --> 12:07.130]  I've got a lot of stuff going on.
[12:07.130 --> 12:10.610]  Mark all your dates and new stuff down somewhere easy to find, either on a clipboard, on the
[12:10.610 --> 12:14.130]  door, or put duct tape on the gear that you're marking the date.
[12:14.130 --> 12:17.170]  The filters and the emitters on your hydro setup, those need to be cleaned.
[12:17.170 --> 12:18.290]  I've talked about that already.
[12:18.290 --> 12:19.450]  They need to be cleaned.
[12:19.450 --> 12:22.610]  In a big commercial environment, I was cleaning those almost every day.
[12:22.610 --> 12:27.130]  We would walk through, as we're watering, walk the rows and make sure all of the emitters
[12:27.130 --> 12:28.130]  are spraying.
[12:28.130 --> 12:32.070]  And if one's not spraying, you'd have a little bucket or a little dish with more emitters
[12:32.070 --> 12:33.070]  in your hand.
[12:33.070 --> 12:36.950]  And we'd just pull one out, pull the dead one out, put the fresh one in, and then we'd
[12:36.950 --> 12:42.510]  go put those dirty emitters in a bucket with either rubbing alcohol or Fizan or H2O2, something
[12:42.510 --> 12:43.710]  just to kind of pre-clean them.
[12:43.710 --> 12:46.590]  And then later in the day, somebody would go and poke them, clean them up, put those
[12:46.590 --> 12:47.590]  in the clean bin.
[12:47.590 --> 12:51.070]  Then you got new fresh ones tomorrow so that when you find all the dead emitters, just
[12:51.070 --> 12:52.190]  replace them.
[12:52.190 --> 12:54.510]  And that's because we used a bunch of chunky nutrients.
[12:54.510 --> 12:59.550]  Some of the stuff we were using, the carbonaria and the Shine together would really clog up
[12:59.550 --> 13:00.550]  the hydro system.
[13:00.550 --> 13:02.670]  So we'd really have to do some cleaning on that.
[13:02.670 --> 13:04.070]  I am kind of rambling.
[13:04.070 --> 13:07.590]  Let's get myself back on focus.
[13:07.590 --> 13:08.710]  Clean all of the equipment.
[13:08.710 --> 13:10.190]  You know the equipment in the room.
[13:10.190 --> 13:11.190]  Clean that shit.
[13:11.190 --> 13:12.190]  Clean all of it.
[13:12.190 --> 13:14.190]  Then clean all of your tools.
[13:14.190 --> 13:15.590]  Your pH pen, clean it.
[13:15.590 --> 13:16.590]  It's dirty.
[13:16.590 --> 13:17.590]  It's really funky.
[13:17.590 --> 13:18.590]  All your scissors, they're dirty.
[13:18.590 --> 13:19.590]  Clean them.
[13:19.590 --> 13:20.590]  Just take out the trash.
[13:20.590 --> 13:21.830]  Clean all of the stuff.
[13:21.830 --> 13:22.830]  You know what is dirty.
[13:22.830 --> 13:24.270]  You know what's funky.
[13:24.270 --> 13:25.270]  Do you have...
[13:25.270 --> 13:26.270]  Let's see.
[13:26.270 --> 13:28.130]  Let me get myself back on notes because I do have some notes here.
[13:28.130 --> 13:29.130]  Clean the ceiling.
[13:29.130 --> 13:30.270]  Start at the ceiling.
[13:30.270 --> 13:32.030]  You may not think the ceiling's dirty.
[13:32.390 --> 13:33.390]  It is.
[13:33.390 --> 13:34.390]  Clean the ceiling.
[13:34.390 --> 13:35.390]  Clean the walls.
[13:35.390 --> 13:36.390]  Clean the floor.
[13:36.390 --> 13:38.310]  Everything in between there, give it a clean.
[13:38.310 --> 13:40.310]  Is the Dosatron working properly?
[13:40.310 --> 13:44.350]  I know that's a big facility device, but let's test that thing.
[13:44.350 --> 13:45.690]  Is it working properly?
[13:45.690 --> 13:47.070]  Let's go in and make sure.
[13:47.070 --> 13:52.550]  If you've got this bottle set up to spit 7 milliliters per dosing every time, just pull
[13:52.550 --> 13:56.270]  out the emitter and see if it's actually spitting out however many milliliters you think it's
[13:56.270 --> 13:57.710]  actually spitting out.
[13:57.710 --> 13:58.710]  Test the Dosatron.
[13:58.710 --> 14:02.990]  See if all the automated equipment...
[14:02.990 --> 14:04.270]  Automated was the word I'm looking for, I promise.
[14:04.270 --> 14:08.550]  See if all of the automated feeding equipment is working.
[14:08.550 --> 14:10.070]  Is all of the automation working?
[14:10.070 --> 14:11.670]  We pay a lot of money for automation.
[14:11.670 --> 14:14.270]  We pay a lot of money to rely on that stuff.
[14:14.270 --> 14:16.770]  Is it working the way we think it is working?
[14:16.770 --> 14:18.350]  Let's test all of those things.
[14:18.350 --> 14:22.390]  Anything you think you've got set to cycle on or cycle off at a certain time, have you
[14:22.390 --> 14:23.390]  checked it in a while?
[14:23.390 --> 14:24.390]  Have you checked the timers?
[14:24.390 --> 14:26.710]  Are the timers where you think they are?
[14:26.710 --> 14:29.670]  Because you think that you changed that fan to come on at a certain time and go off at
[14:29.670 --> 14:33.350]  a certain time when you changed the timer, but maybe you missed a fan or something.
[14:33.350 --> 14:34.350]  Check on all of that stuff.
[14:34.350 --> 14:36.710]  I'm just double checking because it's the first of the month.
[14:36.710 --> 14:40.570]  It is a good time to make a checklist and run through and make sure you've got everything
[14:40.570 --> 14:43.470]  because again, we do get overloaded as growers.
[14:43.470 --> 14:48.070]  We also smoke a little bit of ganja, so we do have a tendency to miss some detail.
[14:48.070 --> 14:52.430]  So I'm just trying to make a list to help you out to set you up for success.
[14:52.430 --> 14:55.750]  Now what else are we going to think about?
[14:55.750 --> 14:56.950]  Are the drains clear?
[14:56.950 --> 15:00.630]  I've got the luxury in a commercial environment to have a floor drain.
[15:00.630 --> 15:02.030]  Are all those drains clear?
[15:02.030 --> 15:03.110]  Do they need to be cleared?
[15:03.110 --> 15:04.390]  Do we need to run a snake down there?
[15:04.390 --> 15:05.790]  Do we need to get a plumber?
[15:05.790 --> 15:07.670]  Do we need some help getting those drains cleared?
[15:07.670 --> 15:09.350]  How are the drains?
[15:09.350 --> 15:12.790]  Now let's talk about stuff that everybody's got going on in their grow.
[15:12.790 --> 15:14.470]  The scissor and mix area.
[15:14.470 --> 15:19.110]  I've got a little table where I keep my scissors and all my mixing stuff and my notes.
[15:19.110 --> 15:20.630]  Is that area cleaned up?
[15:20.630 --> 15:21.930]  Is that clean and tidy?
[15:21.930 --> 15:25.430]  You can get more work done if you've got a nice area.
[15:25.430 --> 15:27.150]  Set yourself up for success.
[15:27.150 --> 15:30.090]  Don't have all kinds of excessive shit on your workspace.
[15:30.090 --> 15:33.230]  If you use these bottles, maybe have these bottles right here.
[15:33.230 --> 15:34.950]  Have some notes here on how to use them.
[15:34.950 --> 15:36.150]  Have your measuring equipment.
[15:36.150 --> 15:37.150]  Have some scissors.
[15:37.150 --> 15:40.690]  Have some towels or some rags to clean up some messes.
[15:40.690 --> 15:42.230]  Have your safety equipment.
[15:42.230 --> 15:45.310]  But then you don't really need a lot of other ... You don't need a bunch of excessive shit
[15:45.310 --> 15:46.310]  around.
[15:46.310 --> 15:49.110]  It just makes ... It's distracting and it makes messes and it will slow you down.
[15:49.110 --> 15:50.710]  So is your area clean?
[15:50.710 --> 15:53.190]  How about your scissors and your mixing cups?
[15:53.190 --> 15:54.230]  Are they clean?
[15:54.230 --> 15:56.750]  I use a scale for powdered nutrients.
[15:56.750 --> 15:59.190]  Is your scale for measuring nutrients clean?
[15:59.190 --> 16:00.630]  Is it calibrated?
[16:00.630 --> 16:02.070]  That's something important to think about.
[16:02.070 --> 16:03.630]  Is that scale calibrated?
[16:03.630 --> 16:08.870]  Because I'm using that to measure five grams of powdered nutrients per gallon of water.
[16:08.870 --> 16:13.510]  If that thing is off, then I am not feeding properly at all, which we can double check
[16:13.510 --> 16:15.630]  with our EC and our pH meters.
[16:15.630 --> 16:17.430]  Are those clean and calibrated?
[16:17.430 --> 16:20.170]  Those need attention as well.
[16:20.170 --> 16:24.530]  Something we may not think about, but I think needs attention are the smoke alarms.
[16:24.530 --> 16:28.250]  The smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors.
[16:28.250 --> 16:29.510]  Have they been tested?
[16:29.510 --> 16:30.750]  Are they working?
[16:30.750 --> 16:32.430]  Are they in good working condition?
[16:32.430 --> 16:34.650]  Those are going to possibly save a life.
[16:34.650 --> 16:39.530]  So fire alarms, CO2 alarms, and then you need that fire extinguisher.
[16:39.530 --> 16:42.550]  If you do have a fire, hopefully you've got a fire extinguisher.
[16:42.550 --> 16:43.850]  Check that bad dog.
[16:43.850 --> 16:45.970]  Do you know how to use the fire extinguisher?
[16:45.970 --> 16:47.250]  Having it is one thing.
[16:47.250 --> 16:48.990]  Knowing how to use it is another thing.
[16:48.990 --> 16:50.090]  Do you know how to use it?
[16:50.090 --> 16:51.210]  Are you ready to use it?
[16:51.210 --> 16:53.370]  Are you going to shit your pants and freak out?
[16:53.370 --> 16:57.090]  Or you're going to pull the pin, aim toward the bottom of the fire, and spray and burst
[16:57.090 --> 16:58.490]  in a sweeping motion.
[16:58.490 --> 16:59.490]  Which one are you going to do?
[16:59.490 --> 17:00.730]  Do you know how to use that?
[17:00.730 --> 17:02.450]  So be ready for that.
[17:02.450 --> 17:04.050]  Then how about a first aid kit?
[17:04.050 --> 17:05.890]  I don't want you to get hurt in your grow.
[17:05.890 --> 17:06.970]  I really hope you don't.
[17:06.970 --> 17:08.330]  I've been cutting grows before.
[17:08.330 --> 17:10.530]  I've seen people have problems in grows.
[17:10.530 --> 17:14.330]  If you have a basic first aid kit, it can really help you out.
[17:14.330 --> 17:17.210]  Many of you may be in a place where you shouldn't be growing.
[17:17.210 --> 17:19.890]  What's going to happen if you're growing some ganja and you cut your finger or you
[17:19.890 --> 17:23.810]  get pH down in your eye and you need some emergency medical help?
[17:23.810 --> 17:24.810]  Do you have a plan?
[17:24.810 --> 17:25.930]  Who are you going to call?
[17:25.930 --> 17:28.310]  Hopefully Ghostbusters is in your neighborhood.
[17:28.310 --> 17:30.290]  Maybe you've got a friend that can back you up.
[17:30.290 --> 17:34.530]  Maybe you're not able to call 911 and say, hey, I'm working in my weed garden in my basement
[17:34.530 --> 17:35.850]  and I got pH down in my eye.
[17:35.850 --> 17:36.850]  I need some help.
[17:36.850 --> 17:40.650]  You may have to call a friend and guide them to you and get some help and say, hey, I've
[17:40.650 --> 17:43.410]  got to get to the doctor, but we can't let them know what's going on here.
[17:43.410 --> 17:46.450]  Have a plan in place if some shit like that is a possibility.
[17:46.450 --> 17:48.290]  Who are you going to call?
[17:48.290 --> 17:49.850]  Luckily we've got all these devices.
[17:49.850 --> 17:51.970]  I've got my iPhone where I can open it up.
[17:51.970 --> 17:56.170]  I can unlock it really easily without too much complication and I can speak to it to
[17:56.170 --> 17:58.970]  give it commands of who to call for me.
[17:58.970 --> 18:01.930]  Maybe if you don't have that sort of device, you've got to figure out some sort of backup
[18:01.930 --> 18:04.690]  plan of what you're going to do if shit does go wrong.
[18:04.690 --> 18:08.130]  You've got to have somebody in mind that can get to you and help you out before the police
[18:08.130 --> 18:09.130]  get there.
[18:09.130 --> 18:10.270]  That may be something you need.
[18:10.270 --> 18:13.810]  I don't want anything to go wrong, but I want you to have a plan if it does.
[18:13.810 --> 18:17.290]  A basic first aid kit could really help you out.
[18:17.290 --> 18:21.850]  You've got some band-aids, some gauze, some tape in there, maybe a tourniquet or something.
[18:21.850 --> 18:27.290]  I'm not sure what you might need, but a basic first aid kit could really help you out.
[18:27.290 --> 18:30.730]  Speaking of basic first aid, how about personal protective equipment?
[18:30.730 --> 18:35.610]  A lot of us are applying pesticides or doing some sort of spray applications in our grow.
[18:35.610 --> 18:37.170]  Have you cleaned your respirator?
[18:37.170 --> 18:39.010]  Do you know how to clean your mask properly?
[18:39.010 --> 18:43.210]  Have you been properly trained or have you read how to clean your respirator and your
[18:43.610 --> 18:44.610]  mask?
[18:44.610 --> 18:45.610]  Are your cartridges up to date?
[18:45.610 --> 18:49.090]  You've got to have the proper cartridges in your mask and they've got to be new and not
[18:49.090 --> 18:53.290]  expired and not have too many miles on them, or you're basically just wearing that mask
[18:53.290 --> 18:54.290]  for discomfort.
[18:54.290 --> 18:57.770]  So you keep your carts up to date and keep your mask clean.
[18:57.770 --> 18:59.450]  Also, how about your suits?
[18:59.450 --> 19:01.730]  Are you using fresh Tyvek suits every time?
[19:01.730 --> 19:04.690]  You're not supposed to recycle those suits.
[19:04.690 --> 19:07.330]  Basically you guys clean everything.
[19:07.330 --> 19:11.650]  This is just basically a responsibility checklist that I'm just trying to remind you to clean
[19:11.650 --> 19:12.770]  everything.
[19:12.770 --> 19:16.290]  You've gotten to the scissors, the pH equipment, the measuring equipment.
[19:16.290 --> 19:17.730]  How about your measuring cups?
[19:17.730 --> 19:21.970]  I've also got measuring cups and shot glasses that I use to measure nutrients.
[19:21.970 --> 19:22.970]  Clean those.
[19:22.970 --> 19:23.970]  It doesn't take very long.
[19:23.970 --> 19:26.810]  Pour a cleaner in there, hit it with a rag, let it dry.
[19:26.810 --> 19:29.490]  Next time you need to use it, it's nice and clean and nice and shiny.
[19:29.490 --> 19:30.490]  Makes you feel good.
[19:30.490 --> 19:31.490]  The grow looks good.
[19:31.490 --> 19:32.750]  You've set yourself up for success.
[19:32.750 --> 19:35.110]  It's one less problem you're going to have in the future.
[19:35.110 --> 19:38.390]  One less thing slowing you down when you're trying to get work done.
[19:38.390 --> 19:41.030]  Let me catch my breath and see where I am in the notes.
[19:41.030 --> 19:43.710]  How long has it been since you've cleaned your sprayer?
[19:43.710 --> 19:46.750]  Whatever you were spraying your plants with, how long has it been since you've actually
[19:46.750 --> 19:48.670]  given that thing a good cleaning?
[19:48.670 --> 19:53.350]  I've got a handheld pump sprayer and the commercial grow we use paint sprayers.
[19:53.350 --> 19:54.910]  Sometimes those will need maintenance.
[19:54.910 --> 19:58.670]  The handheld sprayer, you need to run some clean water through it and clean that hose
[19:58.670 --> 19:59.670]  out.
[19:59.670 --> 20:02.610]  There might be stuff stuck in the tubes and you don't want to spray the wrong product
[20:02.610 --> 20:04.090]  on your plants at the wrong time.
[20:04.090 --> 20:07.790]  If you think you've mixed up this and there's still some of the last previous spray left
[20:07.790 --> 20:10.370]  in the tubes, that could cause problems.
[20:10.370 --> 20:12.530]  The paint sprayers can be a pain in the ass.
[20:12.530 --> 20:18.090]  They oftentimes need reprimed and they definitely need to be cleaned out very frequently.
[20:18.090 --> 20:21.570]  Keep your paint sprayer up to speed by just general maintenance.
[20:21.570 --> 20:22.770]  There are a lot of good videos.
[20:22.770 --> 20:27.130]  I found that almost every brand paint sprayer, I think the one that we like the most is the
[20:27.130 --> 20:28.250]  Grayco.
[20:28.250 --> 20:32.330]  They've got a great YouTube presence where you can read about repriming and cleaning
[20:32.330 --> 20:34.010]  all those machines really easily.
[20:34.010 --> 20:37.890]  They don't pay me to talk about that, but I think it's really helpful for you.
[20:37.890 --> 20:40.650]  I think it's Grayco is the name of the brand, the blue one, right?
[20:40.650 --> 20:41.850]  I can see it in my head.
[20:41.850 --> 20:44.450]  I've got the image in my head, but I can't think of the name of the brand.
[20:44.450 --> 20:46.570]  I'm pretty sure it's Grayco.
[20:46.570 --> 20:51.090]  If you go to YouTube and type in Grayco paint sprayer, all the info you need is right there.
[20:51.090 --> 20:53.930]  They'll teach you how to take it apart and rebuild it and you can do it in just a couple
[20:53.930 --> 20:54.930]  of hours.
[20:54.930 --> 20:58.210]  Save yourself a lot of money on a maintenance plan from that company because they'll come
[20:58.210 --> 21:00.370]  fix it for you, but you can do it yourself.
[21:00.370 --> 21:02.650]  It's really easy and you don't want to wait for them.
[21:02.650 --> 21:07.170]  If you need to spray today, you need that shit fixed and they take a week to come.
[21:07.410 --> 21:08.410]  Fix it yourself.
[21:08.410 --> 21:09.410]  All the videos are right there on YouTube.
[21:09.410 --> 21:10.610]  So take care of your paint sprayer.
[21:10.610 --> 21:12.570]  Clean that bitch out if that's what you're using.
[21:12.570 --> 21:15.570]  A lot of people will tell me that a paint sprayer isn't the way to go.
[21:15.570 --> 21:16.570]  It's very effective for me.
[21:16.570 --> 21:17.610]  I like what I'm doing with that.
[21:17.610 --> 21:21.850]  If you're using a fogger, now is definitely the time to clean out your fogger.
[21:21.850 --> 21:23.130]  Clean that shit up.
[21:23.130 --> 21:25.890]  Is it time to do a dump run?
[21:25.890 --> 21:28.010]  We're approaching harvest season right now.
[21:28.010 --> 21:31.770]  People are going to have a lot of sticks, a lot of stems, a lot of root balls, a lot
[21:31.770 --> 21:35.250]  of leftover junk that they don't need from the grow.
[21:35.250 --> 21:36.970]  Where's that going to go?
[21:36.970 --> 21:40.730]  If you've got an indoor grow and you're pulling down crops every couple of months, where are
[21:40.730 --> 21:42.890]  all those sticks and root balls and leftover?
[21:42.890 --> 21:44.290]  Where's all that shit going?
[21:44.290 --> 21:46.970]  Is it time for you to do a dump run?
[21:46.970 --> 21:49.610]  Sometimes my garage builds up a little bit of a mess.
[21:49.610 --> 21:53.010]  It is all grow waste and grow trash and wait until I've got a nice pile.
[21:53.010 --> 21:54.490]  Then we do a dump run.
[21:54.490 --> 21:58.410]  We just take it all to the dump at one time instead of doing just a bunch of small runs.
[21:58.410 --> 21:59.410]  Take it all at once.
[21:59.410 --> 22:00.410]  But is it time?
[22:00.410 --> 22:01.730]  Is it time for you to do a dump run?
[22:01.730 --> 22:03.810]  Have you been building up a bunch of stuff?
[22:03.810 --> 22:07.570]  That big pile is going to contribute to where bugs can hide.
[22:07.570 --> 22:10.850]  If you've had a pest problem and you threw all that shit out in the garage, out in the
[22:10.850 --> 22:14.530]  backyard, the bugs are building there and they're going to work their way back into
[22:14.530 --> 22:16.170]  your grow eventually.
[22:16.170 --> 22:20.990]  Let's get rid of all of that trash, that old root ball stuff, those old sticks.
[22:20.990 --> 22:22.610]  Do you need to do a dump run?
[22:22.610 --> 22:23.610]  All right.
[22:23.610 --> 22:24.890]  Maybe it is time for a dump run.
[22:24.890 --> 22:27.690]  Where are we on my list of good stuff here?
[22:27.690 --> 22:32.850]  Now we are to the part that should be obvious to a lot of people but gets often overlooked.
[22:32.890 --> 22:36.010]  It is time to clean and calibrate our pH meters.
[22:36.010 --> 22:39.490]  Those pH meters need to be calibrated approximately once a week.
[22:39.490 --> 22:42.850]  It should have a check mark on it that shows you that it is calibrated.
[22:42.850 --> 22:46.250]  It only takes a couple of minutes to calibrate it, especially once you get good at it.
[22:46.250 --> 22:50.450]  If you do it every week, you'll get out your seven solution and your four solution and
[22:50.450 --> 22:52.930]  you'll be able to go bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop and you'll get them calibrated
[22:52.930 --> 22:53.930]  in just a couple of minutes.
[22:53.930 --> 22:56.130]  It won't take you time at all.
[22:56.130 --> 23:02.410]  One thing I do recommend is having more than one calibration standard available.
[23:02.410 --> 23:07.210]  If you've got the four solution and the seven solution, maybe have another bottle of the
[23:07.210 --> 23:10.050]  seven solution and test them to each other.
[23:10.050 --> 23:13.970]  After you take it out of the seven, put it in the other seven and see if they both read
[23:13.970 --> 23:15.130]  seven.
[23:15.130 --> 23:18.850]  That way you know that one of your solutions isn't bad and you are properly calibrated.
[23:18.850 --> 23:23.330]  It's time to clean and calibrate your pH pen, your pH meter.
[23:23.330 --> 23:26.610]  However cheap, however expensive it is, now is a good time to clean it.
[23:26.610 --> 23:29.450]  Remember, if the pH meter dries, it dies.
[23:29.450 --> 23:30.850]  Make sure you keep it moist.
[23:30.850 --> 23:31.850]  Keep it clean.
[23:31.850 --> 23:34.410]  It will work much better for a much longer time.
[23:34.410 --> 23:41.090]  Also the EC pens, your electrical conductivity or your TDS meter, whichever one you're using,
[23:41.090 --> 23:44.010]  the PPM EC, there are a lot of meters you can use.
[23:44.010 --> 23:45.010]  Clean that one also.
[23:45.010 --> 23:48.250]  It will work much better and last much longer if you clean it.
[23:48.250 --> 23:52.930]  I don't think those need much calibration, but do clean that.
[23:52.930 --> 23:54.410]  How about nutrient inventory?
[23:54.410 --> 23:58.330]  If it is the first of the month, that is a good time to do a nutrient inventory.
[23:58.330 --> 23:59.330]  Shake your bottles.
[23:59.330 --> 24:00.330]  What are you low on?
[24:00.330 --> 24:01.330]  Do you need to go buy some stuff?
[24:01.810 --> 24:02.810]  Do you need to order some things?
[24:02.810 --> 24:03.810]  Do you need to restock on stuff?
[24:03.810 --> 24:07.250]  It is a really good time to check and see what you might need.
[24:07.250 --> 24:09.930]  Look through the rest of the month in your grow schedule and say, we're going to feed
[24:09.930 --> 24:11.370]  this, we're going to feed this, we're going to feed this.
[24:11.370 --> 24:12.890]  Do I have that stuff?
[24:12.890 --> 24:16.290]  So then when it comes time to mix in your bloom booster, you don't grab the bottle and
[24:16.290 --> 24:19.130]  go, oh, I should have ordered that a week ago.
[24:19.130 --> 24:20.130]  Let's order it now.
[24:20.130 --> 24:24.090]  That way we've got all of the stuff we need throughout the grow and there are no surprises,
[24:24.090 --> 24:27.930]  no late fucking products, no missing products in our reservoir.
[24:27.930 --> 24:29.270]  We've got everything we need.
[24:29.270 --> 24:30.570]  Let's just order the shit right now.
[24:30.810 --> 24:34.530]  If we're going to order nutrients, how about pesticide inventory?
[24:34.530 --> 24:36.730]  What pesticide products do you use?
[24:36.730 --> 24:38.770]  Is it time to order more pesticides?
[24:38.770 --> 24:40.290]  I just say, shake the bottles.
[24:40.290 --> 24:43.410]  I just go down and just shake the bottles and if one feels light, I write it down and
[24:43.410 --> 24:44.410]  order another one.
[24:44.410 --> 24:45.410]  It's that easy.
[24:45.410 --> 24:47.210]  Don't let yourself run out of shit.
[24:47.210 --> 24:48.210]  It's your grow.
[24:48.210 --> 24:49.210]  You're responsible for it.
[24:49.210 --> 24:50.610]  You know what you're going to need.
[24:50.610 --> 24:51.770]  You're the one that's going to order it.
[24:51.770 --> 24:53.370]  You're the one going to use it.
[24:53.370 --> 24:54.370]  Get that shit now.
[24:54.370 --> 24:55.370]  Make it easy.
[24:55.370 --> 24:56.370]  It's the first of the month.
[24:56.370 --> 24:59.570]  Reinvest some of your last harvest back into the next harvest.
[24:59.570 --> 25:03.290]  Try to make the next grow better every single time.
[25:03.290 --> 25:05.250]  So what about other basic inventory?
[25:05.250 --> 25:08.690]  What are other things that I always need to order for my grows?
[25:08.690 --> 25:09.690]  Gloves.
[25:09.690 --> 25:11.670]  We are constantly ordering gloves.
[25:11.670 --> 25:14.330]  How many pair of gloves do you go through a day in your garden?
[25:14.330 --> 25:15.730]  It's not a big math equation.
[25:15.730 --> 25:18.970]  Think about how long you're in there and how many times you change gloves.
[25:18.970 --> 25:21.870]  Multiply that by however many times a week you're in the grow.
[25:21.870 --> 25:22.910]  Multiply that times four.
[25:22.910 --> 25:23.910]  That's a month.
[25:23.910 --> 25:25.470]  That's how many pairs of gloves you go through in a month.
[25:25.470 --> 25:26.770]  How many boxes do you need?
[25:26.770 --> 25:29.970]  Let's order them now so that we don't have to sit around and wait for gloves to come
[25:29.970 --> 25:30.970]  when we do need them.
[25:30.970 --> 25:32.730]  It's really easy to order gloves.
[25:32.730 --> 25:35.490]  A lot of people like to wear a mask, especially the tremors.
[25:35.490 --> 25:37.010]  Let's order all the masks.
[25:37.010 --> 25:39.530]  Masks, that's a fun word.
[25:39.530 --> 25:41.130]  Order all of the shit that you think you need.
[25:41.130 --> 25:44.730]  I don't know what you need in your grow, but let's order it now.
[25:44.730 --> 25:47.850]  I go through a lot of clone plugs, like a lot of rapid routers.
[25:47.850 --> 25:50.290]  I go through a lot of plant tags.
[25:50.290 --> 25:52.410]  Just basic things that I know I'm going to need.
[25:52.410 --> 25:54.570]  I try to order that stuff on the first.
[25:54.570 --> 25:58.450]  That way it comes, I have to make one trip to the grow store or I get one big box from
[25:58.450 --> 25:59.450]  Amazon.
[25:59.450 --> 26:01.630]  It saves on shipping, saves on moving around.
[26:01.630 --> 26:05.690]  Just makes it so much easier to do one big monthly order.
[26:05.690 --> 26:06.690]  All right.
[26:06.690 --> 26:11.710]  Now, here's another thing we're going to segue into that a lot of people may have overlooked.
[26:11.710 --> 26:13.770]  Let's double check our security.
[26:13.770 --> 26:15.750]  What do you have going on for your security?
[26:15.750 --> 26:19.610]  The first thing I recommend is just if wherever you're growing, whatever building it is in,
[26:19.610 --> 26:24.190]  if you're growing in a room inside of a house, let's just check the security.
[26:24.190 --> 26:25.690]  Walk around outside.
[26:25.690 --> 26:27.150]  Just see are there any light leaks?
[26:27.150 --> 26:28.230]  Do you hear any fans?
[26:28.230 --> 26:29.670]  Do you smell anything?
[26:29.670 --> 26:33.790]  Is there anything that would tip you off that there is a grow inside of that room or that
[26:33.790 --> 26:34.870]  building?
[26:34.870 --> 26:39.350]  Because if you can find it, that means that thieves, that means it snitches, and that
[26:39.350 --> 26:41.590]  means that cops can find that grow as well.
[26:41.590 --> 26:44.350]  We don't want those folks finding our grows.
[26:44.350 --> 26:45.430]  Be very careful.
[26:45.430 --> 26:46.430]  Walk around.
[26:46.430 --> 26:48.510]  See if you can see any light leaking out of your grow.
[26:48.510 --> 26:49.510]  Do you smell anything?
[26:49.510 --> 26:50.510]  Do you hear fans?
[26:50.510 --> 26:52.510]  Do you hear any sort of air conditioning?
[26:52.510 --> 26:53.750]  Do you hear shit cycling?
[26:53.750 --> 26:54.750]  Is it weird?
[26:54.750 --> 26:56.790]  Do you feel vibrations from the blowers?
[26:56.790 --> 26:58.710]  Just go check outside.
[26:58.710 --> 27:01.690]  If you're growing in a big building, walk around the whole building.
[27:01.690 --> 27:05.450]  If you're growing in a room inside of a building, check that outside of that area, and then
[27:05.450 --> 27:09.410]  check like ... If you're growing in the room adjacent to this one, sit in this room and
[27:09.410 --> 27:14.270]  see if you hear a smell or see anything that would alert you to a grow in the other room.
[27:14.270 --> 27:15.950]  Just double check your security.
[27:15.950 --> 27:17.330]  Then check your safety.
[27:17.330 --> 27:18.890]  Is that all locked up?
[27:18.890 --> 27:20.750]  Is there a way for anybody to get in there?
[27:20.750 --> 27:24.310]  People often forget that when you put an air conditioner in the window, all I got to
[27:24.310 --> 27:28.150]  do is push that air conditioner in, and I'm in your grow.
[27:28.150 --> 27:30.750]  It's a hint that it's there, and it's an entryway.
[27:30.750 --> 27:33.290]  Keep that shit in mind when you're building your rooms.
[27:33.290 --> 27:36.590]  Don't give me too many access points and give me too many hints.
[27:36.590 --> 27:39.170]  People are out there, and they're trying to get shit from you.
[27:39.170 --> 27:42.790]  It's a weird time right now, and people are going fucking crazy for anything they can
[27:42.790 --> 27:43.790]  get.
[27:43.790 --> 27:45.270]  Protect yourself.
[27:45.270 --> 27:46.690]  Check your security.
[27:46.690 --> 27:48.790]  Do you have security cameras?
[27:48.790 --> 27:50.630]  Do you have security camera footage?
[27:50.670 --> 27:53.870]  Do you have backups of your security camera footage?
[27:53.870 --> 27:56.670]  Do you have all your cameras set up the way that they need to be?
[27:56.670 --> 27:59.510]  Then think about where all of that camera footage is going.
[27:59.510 --> 28:01.390]  Is that saved somewhere within your house?
[28:01.390 --> 28:06.190]  Is it on a DVR in your house where that DVR could possibly be stolen, or is it backed
[28:06.190 --> 28:10.390]  up somewhere to the internet to where it's stored in a cloud and a server to where that
[28:10.390 --> 28:13.830]  footage is always accessible and can't be taken away from you?
[28:13.830 --> 28:17.290]  Another detail I would think about is how long has it been since you've changed your
[28:17.410 --> 28:20.650]  security codes and passwords, and who has keys?
[28:20.650 --> 28:25.410]  If you've got a facility with a gate, maybe you had to give keys to an electrician.
[28:25.410 --> 28:26.970]  Maybe an HVAC tech has a key.
[28:26.970 --> 28:28.930]  Maybe an old employee has a key.
[28:28.930 --> 28:30.250]  Think about where those keys are.
[28:30.250 --> 28:33.090]  Also, who has passcodes to your alarm system?
[28:33.090 --> 28:35.130]  Who has passcodes to your cameras?
[28:35.130 --> 28:38.250]  Who has any sort of passwords or codes to anything?
[28:38.250 --> 28:39.250]  Think about that.
[28:39.250 --> 28:43.890]  Now may be the time to do that thing where you log out of all devices, change your password,
[28:43.890 --> 28:44.890]  and log back in.
[28:44.890 --> 28:50.330]  Now may be the time to do that sort of stuff, especially if you had any firing, rehiring,
[28:50.330 --> 28:54.550]  any breakups, any shifts, any rifts in the matrix.
[28:54.550 --> 28:58.690]  Now may be the time to change passwords and do some sort of security upgrades, things
[28:58.690 --> 28:59.690]  like that.
[28:59.690 --> 29:02.530]  You never know what people are up to, especially now.
[29:02.530 --> 29:04.690]  Things are weird, you guys.
[29:04.690 --> 29:09.770]  Back up your security footage, change your security passwords and security codes, just
[29:09.770 --> 29:11.290]  because we don't know.
[29:11.290 --> 29:15.210]  Maybe also change any locks that may need to be changed.
[29:15.210 --> 29:18.290]  Now let's talk about some other things that you may need to think about.
[29:18.290 --> 29:21.290]  Do you have MSDS sheets?
[29:21.290 --> 29:25.090]  MSDS sheets are very important, in my opinion.
[29:25.090 --> 29:31.890]  If you were to get a product in your eye or accidentally think that the pH down was kombucha
[29:31.890 --> 29:35.130]  and you pick it up and take a drink of it, and you got to go to the hospital, they're
[29:35.130 --> 29:39.170]  going to want to know all of the information about all of the products you may have exposed
[29:39.170 --> 29:41.170]  yourself or consumed.
[29:41.210 --> 29:43.850]  You need to have an MSDS sheet for all of your products.
[29:43.850 --> 29:48.530]  Whenever in a commercial grow, we're required to have a folder of MSDS sheets.
[29:48.530 --> 29:52.050]  Anytime we get a new product, like if this was a grow product, this is just a bottle
[29:52.050 --> 29:56.650]  of water, but if this was a nutrient, as soon as it came into the grow, I would put it on
[29:56.650 --> 30:00.850]  the table and I would go to the internet and I would type in this product MSDS sheet and
[30:00.850 --> 30:04.210]  I would print that MSDS sheet out and put it in a folder.
[30:04.210 --> 30:08.650]  It would be alphabetically in a folder that sits on a desk with the pesticide logs and
[30:08.650 --> 30:10.290]  a few other important logs.
[30:10.290 --> 30:14.490]  In a commercial grow, we are required to have those sheets for every product that is inside
[30:14.490 --> 30:15.730]  of the facility.
[30:15.730 --> 30:19.170]  In your personal grow, it would just be a good idea, just in case something does go
[30:19.170 --> 30:24.930]  wrong, just to have that product there, that product MSDS sheet there available for you.
[30:24.930 --> 30:27.970]  The other thing I would have is a spray log.
[30:27.970 --> 30:32.390]  In commercial environments, we're required to write down every pesticide application
[30:32.390 --> 30:34.050]  we spray.
[30:34.050 --> 30:40.210]  We write down what room we sprayed, what products we sprayed, how much of that product was applied.
[30:40.610 --> 30:42.690]  We write down the EPA number.
[30:42.690 --> 30:45.810]  We write down the number of the employee who sprayed that.
[30:45.810 --> 30:49.170]  They've got an EPA number and a training number as well.
[30:49.170 --> 30:52.090]  There are a lot of details that go along with the spray product.
[30:52.090 --> 30:56.070]  I recommend a spray log, even in your personal grow.
[30:56.070 --> 30:58.010]  This will help you out for a couple of reasons.
[30:58.010 --> 31:01.770]  If I don't want you to get sick, I don't want you to spray pesticides in your eyes, I don't
[31:01.770 --> 31:06.450]  want you to get any sort of rash, but if you do and you've got that pesticide log and the
[31:06.450 --> 31:09.250]  MSDS sheet, you've got some hints, some clues.
[31:09.250 --> 31:13.490]  If we've got to take you to the hospital because you're in anaphylactic shock, those two things
[31:13.490 --> 31:16.930]  may help me out to figure out how to save your life.
[31:16.930 --> 31:22.770]  The MSDS sheet and the spray log, I think are very important, even in a personal grow.
[31:22.770 --> 31:26.930]  Just consider those MSDS sheets and those spray logs as part of the notes that you should
[31:26.930 --> 31:27.930]  be taking anyway.
[31:27.930 --> 31:30.370]  You should be taking copious notes with your grow.
[31:30.370 --> 31:32.210]  You should be making a nice journal.
[31:32.210 --> 31:35.610]  If things go right, you're going to want to be able to repeat that process.
[31:35.770 --> 31:39.170]  If you've got good notes, then you know exactly what you did and you can repeat it.
[31:39.170 --> 31:41.170]  If you just guess, you're just guessing.
[31:41.170 --> 31:43.530]  Who knows if we're going to get it right again next time.
[31:43.530 --> 31:46.810]  It's not like grandma's cake recipe or grandma's breakfast recipe.
[31:46.810 --> 31:48.530]  You can't just guess and throw some of this shit in there.
[31:48.530 --> 31:52.110]  It might work, but it's not going to be the same every single time.
[31:52.110 --> 31:55.850]  If you have notes, if you've got documentation, we can repeat the process.
[31:55.850 --> 32:00.290]  In a commercial environment, that's what's required, is a repeatable, improvable process
[32:00.290 --> 32:03.010]  with quantifiable results.
[32:03.010 --> 32:04.250]  Let me move forward.
[32:04.250 --> 32:07.930]  Here's another thing that most growers may not think about, but once you get a little
[32:07.930 --> 32:11.430]  bit more advanced, maybe I think about it because I'm a business owner and I work in
[32:11.430 --> 32:13.370]  big commercial industry grows.
[32:13.370 --> 32:15.090]  How about an expense report?
[32:15.090 --> 32:17.530]  How much are you spending on your grow?
[32:17.530 --> 32:20.010]  Are you documenting your monthly electrical bill?
[32:20.010 --> 32:22.250]  Are you documenting your monthly water bill?
[32:22.250 --> 32:24.650]  Are you documenting how much you spend on nutrients?
[32:24.650 --> 32:27.550]  Are you documenting how much you spend on soil?
[32:27.550 --> 32:31.730]  Are you documenting how much you spent on the equipment and setting up the grow?
[32:31.730 --> 32:33.970]  Are you considering your time and energy?
[32:33.970 --> 32:35.010]  Are you paying yourself?
[32:35.010 --> 32:39.570]  Are you documenting how many hours a week or a month you spend in that grow space?
[32:39.570 --> 32:42.130]  Let's just start writing down an expense report.
[32:42.130 --> 32:43.170]  How much are we spending?
[32:43.170 --> 32:45.370]  How much time are we putting into this?
[32:45.370 --> 32:48.450]  Then let's also keep good notes on the harvest reports.
[32:48.450 --> 32:50.330]  Write down every gram you harvest.
[32:50.330 --> 32:53.810]  Anything that you pull out of there, let's document that as well.
[32:53.810 --> 32:56.890]  Then over time, you'll have a couple of quantifiable reports.
[32:56.890 --> 32:58.410]  You can see what you're spending.
[32:58.410 --> 33:01.730]  You can see if you're spending more or less than when you started, and you can see if
[33:01.730 --> 33:05.370]  you're pulling more or less product than when you started, and you can see if you're
[33:05.370 --> 33:07.490]  improving or if you're getting worse.
[33:07.490 --> 33:09.690]  Maybe then you can find areas to improve.
[33:09.690 --> 33:13.570]  Once you start taking notes, you start seeing like, oh, I could have done this better, could
[33:13.570 --> 33:14.890]  have done this better.
[33:14.890 --> 33:16.850]  Last time we did this and we didn't get as much herb.
[33:16.850 --> 33:18.570]  This time we did this, we got more.
[33:18.570 --> 33:20.490]  You can start seeing those things.
[33:20.490 --> 33:22.050]  Start taking copious notes.
[33:22.050 --> 33:26.130]  I really think that having a journal and taking a lot of notes is really important.
[33:26.130 --> 33:30.730]  Then when you see that cost and expense sheet, then you really see like, oh, I used to spend
[33:31.050 --> 33:32.410]  300 bucks.
[33:32.410 --> 33:33.410]  I don't know.
[33:33.410 --> 33:35.290]  I'm just guessing how much a week or a month you might spend.
[33:35.290 --> 33:40.010]  I used to spend 300 bucks a month on herb, and since I spent 1,200 bucks on building
[33:40.010 --> 33:44.410]  that grow, that means that if I make enough herb for four months worth of herb that I've
[33:44.410 --> 33:48.210]  paid off all my equipment, everything after that, I'm just kind of paying for electricity
[33:48.210 --> 33:49.930]  and water and my energy.
[33:49.930 --> 33:51.850]  Then you know like, I've paid off the equipment.
[33:51.850 --> 33:54.210]  Now maybe I can upgrade to a new light.
[33:54.210 --> 33:57.850]  It really will help you out once you start seeing like what you're putting in and what
[33:57.850 --> 33:58.890]  you're getting out of it.
[33:58.930 --> 34:00.810]  You'll want to improve at that rate.
[34:00.810 --> 34:04.970]  So I really think that the expense report is just part of the basic grow journaling.
[34:04.970 --> 34:09.250]  If you're taking a lot of details and taking notes, that expense report will fall right
[34:09.250 --> 34:10.890]  in line with the rest of your notes.
[34:10.890 --> 34:12.070]  Maybe it's just another page.
[34:12.070 --> 34:13.770]  Maybe it's another part of the spreadsheet.
[34:13.770 --> 34:17.330]  However you're doing it, I think once you get comfortable and used to it, it'll just
[34:17.330 --> 34:21.530]  be another part of the documentation which you are keeping.
[34:21.530 --> 34:26.210]  Another thing that I think is important is to have goals and plans.
[34:26.210 --> 34:29.810]  If you've got that expense sheet, it will help you set goals and it will help you make
[34:29.810 --> 34:31.050]  plans.
[34:31.050 --> 34:32.530]  How do you know you're reaching any goals?
[34:32.530 --> 34:36.650]  How do you know you're successful if you never wrote down any goals and made any plans?
[34:36.650 --> 34:38.330]  We all want to grow some weed, right?
[34:38.330 --> 34:40.130]  If you get a harvest, that's cool.
[34:40.130 --> 34:41.130]  That's success.
[34:41.130 --> 34:43.170]  But how do you know that the next harvest is better?
[34:43.170 --> 34:45.290]  How do you know that the next one is better?
[34:45.290 --> 34:46.290]  Let's have some goals.
[34:46.290 --> 34:47.650]  Let's have some plans.
[34:47.650 --> 34:48.770]  Write down a schedule.
[34:48.770 --> 34:51.250]  I'm going to plant this many seeds at this day.
[34:51.250 --> 34:53.890]  I'm going to put them into small pots this day.
[34:53.890 --> 34:55.810]  Then they're going to go into bigger pots this day.
[34:56.410 --> 34:58.730]  I intend to flower on this day.
[34:58.730 --> 35:00.970]  Leave yourself some openings, some windows.
[35:00.970 --> 35:04.450]  Maybe the plants don't grow as fast as you need it or maybe they grow faster.
[35:04.450 --> 35:06.610]  But try to have an idea, a schedule.
[35:06.610 --> 35:10.370]  I've been growing so long that when we go to a commercial grow, I can look at the height,
[35:10.370 --> 35:13.210]  I can look at the space, and I can say, here is the schedule.
[35:13.210 --> 35:15.510]  We're going to need nine weeks of flower.
[35:15.510 --> 35:18.830]  That means that nine weeks in the flower room, that's undeniable.
[35:18.830 --> 35:19.830]  That's what we need.
[35:19.830 --> 35:21.310]  They've got to flower nine weeks in here.
[35:21.310 --> 35:24.090]  How big can I get them by the time they're done?
[35:24.090 --> 35:27.950]  How big do I have to get them in here before I flower them to max them out at their maximum
[35:27.950 --> 35:30.090]  height in this room before we're done?
[35:30.090 --> 35:31.890]  That tells me how many weeks we can veg.
[35:31.890 --> 35:36.970]  I just automatically start thinking two weeks in the cloner, two weeks in small pots, three
[35:36.970 --> 35:37.970]  weeks in big pots.
[35:37.970 --> 35:39.690]  Then we move them into the flower room.
[35:39.690 --> 35:40.690]  It'll work perfectly.
[35:40.690 --> 35:41.690]  I just start scheduling.
[35:41.690 --> 35:42.690]  I make a plan.
[35:42.690 --> 35:46.330]  Then we stick to those plans and schedules and create routines and rhythms and standard
[35:46.330 --> 35:47.930]  operating procedures.
[35:47.930 --> 35:51.770]  The way to do that is to have some goals and have some plans.
[35:51.770 --> 35:56.050]  If you're working with multiple people, it is really important to get all of those people
[35:56.050 --> 35:57.210]  on the same plan.
[35:57.210 --> 36:01.970]  Make sure everybody knows the goal and make sure everybody knows they're part of the puzzle
[36:01.970 --> 36:03.050]  to reach that goal.
[36:03.050 --> 36:06.050]  If everybody thinks they're a trimmer, nobody's going to water plants.
[36:06.050 --> 36:09.330]  If everybody thinks they're watering plants, nobody's going to defoliate.
[36:09.330 --> 36:11.850]  Make sure everybody knows their role.
[36:11.850 --> 36:15.590]  The easiest way to do that is to find somebody that can be the leader that knows everything
[36:15.590 --> 36:19.650]  that needs to be done that can delegate all of the jobs for the day.
[36:19.650 --> 36:20.650]  Have some goals.
[36:20.650 --> 36:21.650]  Have some plans.
[36:21.730 --> 36:22.730]  Have some objectives.
[36:22.730 --> 36:23.850]  Have an expense sheet.
[36:23.850 --> 36:26.810]  But most importantly in that grow, have a bunch of fun.
[36:26.810 --> 36:30.770]  I know I just gave you a bunch of tasks, a bunch of assignments, a bunch of shit to think
[36:30.770 --> 36:34.450]  about, but most importantly, go in there and have fun.
[36:34.450 --> 36:38.290]  I think it's easier to have fun when we set ourselves up for success.
[36:38.290 --> 36:41.450]  That's what I'm trying to help you do here is set yourself up for success.
[36:41.450 --> 36:46.130]  If you go in that grow and all of the equipment works smoothly, everything just runs, you
[36:46.130 --> 36:50.410]  push that button and all the processes happen and the plants go shebang, you'll be encouraged
[36:50.410 --> 36:51.570]  to be in there more often.
[36:51.570 --> 36:52.570]  It feels good.
[36:52.570 --> 36:55.650]  You'll want to grow, grow more, which means you'll be touching the things more.
[36:55.650 --> 36:56.650]  You'll be paying attention.
[36:56.650 --> 36:58.890]  You'll be learning, which means you'll want to grow more.
[36:58.890 --> 37:01.570]  It'll just trigger more inspiration.
[37:01.570 --> 37:03.650]  You'll get better and better and better.
[37:03.650 --> 37:06.970]  Put a little work into it and watch how much it inspires you.
[37:06.970 --> 37:07.970]  That's all it takes.
[37:07.970 --> 37:10.010]  You'll see that you can accomplish small goals.
[37:10.010 --> 37:11.810]  You'll want to hit bigger goals every day.
[37:11.810 --> 37:15.690]  All right, I think that concludes my first of the month garden checklist.
[37:15.690 --> 37:16.850]  I hope I taught you some things.
[37:16.850 --> 37:19.290]  I hope I inspired you to do some things.
[37:19.290 --> 37:21.090]  Maybe you're typing out this list as we go.
[37:21.090 --> 37:24.730]  You're going to have to listen a couple more times and keep up because I feel like I was
[37:24.730 --> 37:27.170]  going quite quickly for this episode.
