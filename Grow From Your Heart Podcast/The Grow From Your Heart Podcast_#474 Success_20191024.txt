[00:00.000 --> 00:01.720]  All right, what's up, podcast world?
[00:01.720 --> 00:02.720]  Here we go.
[00:02.720 --> 00:06.760]  It is time for episode 474 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.760 --> 00:10.420]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[00:10.420 --> 00:14.920]  If you need new regular, feminized, or auto flower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend
[00:14.920 --> 00:22.920]  Seeds Here Now, and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:22.920 --> 00:26.320]  You know, I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:26.320 --> 00:31.920]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Lysergic Lemon Full Spectrum Extract from our friends at
[00:31.920 --> 00:33.240]  Green Dot Labs.
[00:33.240 --> 00:36.800]  This is a blend of lemon, sour double, and sour animal.
[00:36.800 --> 00:41.800]  On the container, the flavor is described as lemon meringue, cleaner, and funk.
[00:41.800 --> 00:43.400]  You know, I think I straight up agree with that.
[00:43.400 --> 00:45.760]  There is a dominant lemon flavor.
[00:45.760 --> 00:49.760]  There is definitely that cleaner kind of a flavor, and it is definitely funky.
[00:49.760 --> 00:55.400]  So big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious Lysergic Lemon Full
[00:55.480 --> 00:57.480]  Spectrum Extract.
[00:57.480 --> 01:01.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, in this episode, I'm going to do a quick rant about
[01:01.560 --> 01:03.760]  setting yourself up for success.
[01:03.760 --> 01:06.160]  If we have time, I may read a quick email.
[01:06.160 --> 01:10.920]  Before we get there, let's do a shout out to some of our friends from Patreon.
[01:10.920 --> 01:14.560]  Let's start off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to my buddy Aldridge.
[01:14.560 --> 01:16.760]  How about a big thank you shout out to Mike H.
[01:16.760 --> 01:20.200]  I want to send a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and a thank you to Just
[01:20.200 --> 01:21.200]  Baz.
[01:21.200 --> 01:22.600]  How about a big thank you shout out to Sam.
[01:22.920 --> 01:25.360]  I want to send a big thank you shout out to Ryan S.
[01:25.360 --> 01:29.240]  Of course, a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast high five to Eric Ross.
[01:29.240 --> 01:33.720]  I always want to send a big high five and a shout out to my buddy Nomi by my guacamole.
[01:33.720 --> 01:38.560]  And last but certainly not least, a big Viking handshake and a Grow From Your Heart podcast
[01:38.560 --> 01:42.080]  shout out to our buddy Grimbold the Druid.
[01:42.080 --> 01:46.280]  I want to thank everybody once again for continuing to support the show through Patreon.
[01:46.280 --> 01:52.920]  If you would like to learn how to become a patron, all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com
[01:52.920 --> 01:54.880]  slash grow from your heart.
[01:54.880 --> 02:00.080]  All of the information you need to become a patron will be right there on the screen.
[02:00.080 --> 02:03.620]  Before we jump into the main part of the show, I want to spend a couple of seconds talking
[02:03.620 --> 02:06.360]  about what I got to do a few nights ago.
[02:06.360 --> 02:10.980]  If you listen to the show regularly, you know that I am a giant comedy fan.
[02:10.980 --> 02:15.740]  Just a few nights ago, one of my favorite comedians on the planet came to Denver and
[02:15.740 --> 02:21.520]  I took my buddy Clint up to Denver and we got to go see Joey Coco Diaz and he blew the
[02:21.520 --> 02:23.940]  roof off of the Paramount Theater.
[02:23.940 --> 02:25.740]  Joey is a bad motherfucker.
[02:25.740 --> 02:29.840]  If you were into comedy, if you have been paying attention to Joey Diaz, Joey is at
[02:29.840 --> 02:31.380]  the top of his game.
[02:31.380 --> 02:33.620]  Now is the time to go see Joey.
[02:33.620 --> 02:37.980]  If you're not already listening to the Church of What's Happening Now podcast, now is the
[02:37.980 --> 02:39.940]  time to subscribe.
[02:39.940 --> 02:46.420]  Mr. Joey Coco fucking Diaz is on a brand new level of comedy, which I have never seen before.
[02:46.420 --> 02:51.280]  So if you're into comedy, if you're into podcasting, and if you're into Joey Diaz, I highly recommend
[02:51.280 --> 02:53.860]  you go see Joey while he is hot.
[02:53.860 --> 02:57.540]  And if you're not already into Joey, now is the time to discover him.
[02:57.540 --> 02:59.500]  Check out Joey Coco Diaz.
[02:59.500 --> 03:02.380]  I should also give a big shout out to Felicia Michaels.
[03:02.380 --> 03:03.620]  Felicia opened for Joey.
[03:03.620 --> 03:06.260]  They have been friends for about 100 years now.
[03:06.380 --> 03:09.980]  They used to do a podcast together called The Beauty and the Beast.
[03:09.980 --> 03:12.980]  Of course, Felicia was the beauty and Joey was the beast.
[03:12.980 --> 03:14.200]  That is a great podcast.
[03:14.200 --> 03:18.100]  You will get to learn a lot about Joey Diaz from that show.
[03:18.100 --> 03:22.660]  If you're into comedy, if you're into dirty comedy, and you like storytellers, Joey Diaz
[03:22.660 --> 03:24.760]  is somebody you need to learn about.
[03:24.760 --> 03:28.780]  So big shout out to Joey Diaz, big shout out to Felicia Michaels, and again a big shout
[03:28.780 --> 03:33.060]  out to my buddy Clint for always being a fucking perfect comedy buddy.
[03:33.060 --> 03:36.260]  We go and see comedy shows together and he is drama free.
[03:36.260 --> 03:39.380]  So big shout out to Clint for being a great comedy road dog.
[03:39.380 --> 03:43.220]  And I also owe a big shout out to my friend Daniel who came up and said hello to me at
[03:43.220 --> 03:44.220]  the theater.
[03:44.220 --> 03:45.220]  What's up Daniel?
[03:45.220 --> 03:46.220]  I remember you bro.
[03:46.220 --> 03:47.220]  I hope you and your brother are doing well.
[03:47.220 --> 03:49.420]  I'm sorry we didn't get to hang out after the show.
[03:49.420 --> 03:50.420]  You disappeared.
[03:50.420 --> 03:51.980]  Clint and I had to get back to Pueblo.
[03:51.980 --> 03:53.380]  I hope you had a great night.
[03:53.380 --> 03:57.760]  Also I want to send a giant shout out to everybody at the Paramount Theater for making everybody
[03:57.760 --> 03:58.820]  feel like a rock star.
[03:58.820 --> 04:00.900]  They treated us beautifully well in that club.
[04:01.100 --> 04:05.220]  I had a really great time and I cannot wait to go back for another show.
[04:05.220 --> 04:08.180]  All right ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, that is enough talk about comedy.
[04:08.180 --> 04:11.060]  That's enough bragging about all of the fun that I get to have.
[04:11.060 --> 04:15.300]  Let's move this podcast forward and talk about growing or talk about cannabis.
[04:15.300 --> 04:20.060]  Let's actually talk about setting yourself up to grow successfully.
[04:20.060 --> 04:24.500]  I see a lot of people on the internet setting themselves up for failure.
[04:24.500 --> 04:29.420]  I see a lot of people in Facebook groups and other online platforms setting themselves
[04:29.420 --> 04:32.420]  up to fall directly on their faces.
[04:32.420 --> 04:34.580]  I see people trying to take shortcuts.
[04:34.580 --> 04:37.180]  I see people taking shitty advice.
[04:37.180 --> 04:42.580]  I see people buying shitty equipment and cheap nutrients and shitty genetics in an attempt
[04:42.580 --> 04:45.020]  to save a few dollars.
[04:45.020 --> 04:50.660]  Every shortcut you take at the beginning of your grow is going to cost you money at the
[04:50.660 --> 04:56.220]  end of the grow and potentially cause you problems throughout the grow cycle.
[04:56.220 --> 04:58.380]  So set yourself up for success.
[04:58.380 --> 05:00.980]  Let's talk about setting ourselves up for success.
[05:00.980 --> 05:05.020]  A lot of times when I talk about building a grow or setting up a grow space in somebody's
[05:05.020 --> 05:08.500]  home, a lot of people say, well, can't I just do this?
[05:08.500 --> 05:14.060]  And I say, you could just do that, but you're going to harvest just some mediocre product.
[05:14.060 --> 05:18.020]  If you do it the right way and you spend a couple of bucks and take some time and put
[05:18.020 --> 05:22.940]  some effort into it and do some research, you can harvest a beautiful crop.
[05:22.940 --> 05:27.860]  But if you just do it the shit way, you will just harvest some bullshit.
[05:27.860 --> 05:33.060]  So let's set ourselves up for success from the beginning, from day one.
[05:33.060 --> 05:37.740]  And by setting yourself up for success, I mean do some research, study.
[05:37.740 --> 05:39.100]  Why are you growing?
[05:39.100 --> 05:40.100]  What's your point?
[05:40.100 --> 05:43.140]  Do you want to be Pablo Escobar or are you trying to grow some weed so you don't have
[05:43.140 --> 05:44.700]  to pay for it anymore?
[05:44.700 --> 05:45.780]  Have a goal.
[05:45.780 --> 05:47.700]  Set yourself up for success.
[05:47.700 --> 05:50.700]  Once you've got a realistic goal, find a space.
[05:50.700 --> 05:52.700]  Buy the appropriate equipment.
[05:52.700 --> 05:54.900]  Set that equipment up correctly.
[05:54.940 --> 05:58.780]  Don't set up equipment thinking that you're going to be home every day and you are going
[05:58.780 --> 06:03.540]  to personally plug in and unplug that light every day at six o'clock because I promise
[06:03.540 --> 06:06.680]  you, 21 days in, you're going to fall out of the habit.
[06:06.680 --> 06:09.600]  You're going to get bored with it and you're going to fuck it up and you're going to ruin
[06:09.600 --> 06:11.300]  the entire grow.
[06:11.300 --> 06:14.660]  Spend the $19.99 and get a fucking timer.
[06:14.660 --> 06:19.620]  Don't do everything the shit cheap way because it's the shit cheap way and it's easy.
[06:19.620 --> 06:23.940]  Spend a couple of bucks, put some energy into it and respect the fucking plants that you're
[06:23.980 --> 06:27.300]  trying to grow and those plants will respect you back.
[06:27.300 --> 06:32.060]  If you give the plants a shit environment, a shit schedule, shit nutrients, shit love
[06:32.060 --> 06:34.060]  and care, guess what they're going to give you?
[06:34.060 --> 06:35.060]  Shit.
[06:35.060 --> 06:36.980]  You're going to get shit right back from them.
[06:36.980 --> 06:39.820]  Everything you put into your cannabis plants comes back to you.
[06:39.820 --> 06:44.820]  I feel like it comes back threefold, sometimes five, maybe seven, sometimes tenfold.
[06:44.820 --> 06:47.480]  I feel like these plants are very karmic.
[06:47.480 --> 06:49.620]  Everything we put in will come back to us.
[06:49.620 --> 06:53.540]  If you put in love, if you put in time and you put in energy, guess what you're going
[06:53.540 --> 06:54.540]  to get?
[06:54.540 --> 06:57.420]  10 times love, care and energy.
[06:57.420 --> 07:01.700]  If all you invest in your grow room is bullshit and stress, all you're going to get out of
[07:01.700 --> 07:04.620]  that grow room is bullshit and stress.
[07:04.620 --> 07:09.340]  So let's do everything we can to set ourselves up for success from the very beginning.
[07:09.340 --> 07:14.540]  Have a plan, have a space, have the appropriate equipment, have some knowledge of the plants,
[07:14.540 --> 07:16.340]  know what to expect.
[07:16.340 --> 07:18.900]  Don't let things be such a surprise in your grow.
[07:18.900 --> 07:20.380]  Set yourself up for success.
[07:20.380 --> 07:21.660]  Know what is coming.
[07:21.660 --> 07:26.220]  No hockey player would go to a hockey game without his hockey helmet and his skates.
[07:26.220 --> 07:28.440]  That is setting yourself up for success.
[07:28.440 --> 07:31.280]  If you show up for the hockey game without your skates and your helmet, you get to sit
[07:31.280 --> 07:33.480]  on the bench and you've already fucking failed.
[07:33.480 --> 07:36.680]  Now you've led to your entire team failing and you're a big loser.
[07:36.680 --> 07:39.340]  So set yourself up for success.
[07:39.340 --> 07:43.300]  Now once you've got the appropriate equipment, don't cheap out on equipment, you guys.
[07:43.300 --> 07:45.780]  A lot of people say, I can just buy this.
[07:45.860 --> 07:50.260]  Again, you could just buy that or you could spend some money and get a quality light and
[07:50.260 --> 07:52.300]  actually make your grow worth a shit.
[07:52.300 --> 07:53.780]  So get quality equipment.
[07:53.780 --> 07:57.900]  Then I highly recommend quality genetics.
[07:57.900 --> 08:03.180]  No matter how good all of your equipment is, the potential of your garden is mainly limited
[08:03.180 --> 08:06.500]  by the potential of your genetics.
[08:06.500 --> 08:10.860]  If you are growing plants that do not have the potential to reach the goal you desire,
[08:10.860 --> 08:15.100]  you will never reach your goal no matter what you put into those plants.
[08:15.100 --> 08:20.580]  So I recommend you start with either good seeds or good clones and set yourself up for
[08:20.580 --> 08:23.740]  success when you get those seeds or clones.
[08:23.740 --> 08:27.980]  If you choose to start from seed, I highly recommend that those seeds come from a reputable
[08:27.980 --> 08:33.020]  breeder and that you get those seeds from a reputable seed vendor, if not from the breeder
[08:33.020 --> 08:34.220]  directly.
[08:34.220 --> 08:38.340]  If you get clones, I recommend you get clones from somebody you trust.
[08:38.340 --> 08:42.780]  And even if you trust that person with your life, I still recommend you treat those clones
[08:42.900 --> 08:47.660]  like they have got every pest imaginable attached to them when they are given to you.
[08:47.660 --> 08:49.880]  Any clone you get is contaminated.
[08:49.880 --> 08:51.140]  Just think of it that way.
[08:51.140 --> 08:53.700]  Practice safe clone sex.
[08:53.700 --> 08:58.580]  Any clone you get has an STD and we need to get rid of that STD before we put it in the
[08:58.580 --> 09:00.940]  population with our other plants.
[09:00.940 --> 09:03.980]  If these are the first clones you're bringing in, you need to clean them up so that you
[09:03.980 --> 09:05.980]  start with a clean grow.
[09:05.980 --> 09:08.460]  We just spent a bunch of money building a grow environment.
[09:08.460 --> 09:11.940]  We don't need to contaminate that with our first batch of plants.
[09:11.940 --> 09:13.020]  Get those clones.
[09:13.020 --> 09:16.580]  Put them in another area under a small light for a night or two.
[09:16.580 --> 09:18.580]  Spray them down with a few products.
[09:18.580 --> 09:23.020]  Treat them however you feel they need to be treated so they will not be contaminated.
[09:23.020 --> 09:24.020]  Inspect them.
[09:24.020 --> 09:28.140]  Inspect them two or three times and make sure there are no living pests on your plants before
[09:28.140 --> 09:30.700]  you put them into general population.
[09:30.700 --> 09:33.020]  Set yourself up for success.
[09:33.020 --> 09:38.460]  Now a step to setting yourself up for success here is having the proper pesticides on hand
[09:38.460 --> 09:40.620]  before you go get your clones.
[09:40.620 --> 09:45.100]  The appropriate steps for setting yourself up for success here are understanding which
[09:45.100 --> 09:49.980]  pesticides you want to use before you go to the store to buy those pesticides for your
[09:49.980 --> 09:51.180]  new clones.
[09:51.180 --> 09:54.700]  There is a lot of preparation to be done for a successful cannabis grow.
[09:54.700 --> 09:57.060]  So set yourself up for success.
[09:57.060 --> 10:00.380]  Now once you've got your clones into your grow environment, you're going to run into
[10:00.380 --> 10:01.380]  problems.
[10:01.380 --> 10:02.380]  That is okay.
[10:02.380 --> 10:03.380]  That is expected.
[10:03.380 --> 10:08.500]  No grow is going to go 100% smoothly and if it does, you probably don't learn much.
[10:08.500 --> 10:12.300]  So here is one more thing about setting yourself up for success.
[10:12.300 --> 10:18.580]  When you do run into problems, do not go to Facebook groups and ask a bunch of questions
[10:18.580 --> 10:23.700]  and rely on everybody in that group to have a reasonable answer.
[10:23.700 --> 10:29.660]  99% of the grow information, the tips and advice that I see on social media are complete
[10:29.660 --> 10:34.940]  bullshit and will end up causing you more problems than they would if you just left
[10:34.940 --> 10:37.420]  the original problem alone.
[10:37.420 --> 10:42.420]  So one thing that will really help you set yourself up for success is learning to filter
[10:42.420 --> 10:45.500]  out the bullshit on social media.
[10:45.500 --> 10:47.500]  You can ask, what is this?
[10:47.500 --> 10:49.880]  And then 10 people are going to give you answers.
[10:49.880 --> 10:52.980]  You have to get really good at filtering out the bullshit.
[10:52.980 --> 10:59.380]  And the best way to do that is to get a cannabis specific grow book written by an experienced
[10:59.380 --> 11:03.140]  author who grows and writes about cannabis.
[11:03.140 --> 11:06.980]  There are several great books and several great authors out there.
[11:06.980 --> 11:11.420]  I really like the Ed Rosenthal and the Jorge Cervantes books for beginners.
[11:11.420 --> 11:15.300]  Some of those books are a little bit dated and some of the information is a little bit
[11:15.300 --> 11:20.740]  old, but you can get a great knowledge base from those books.
[11:20.740 --> 11:27.180]  I would also suggest that you supplement your cannabis education with quality cannabis podcasts.
[11:27.180 --> 11:29.780]  If you're listening to this show, you're off to a good start.
[11:29.780 --> 11:33.340]  Let me also suggest the Dude Grows show.
[11:33.340 --> 11:37.820]  And if you really want to go deeper into cannabis education, let me recommend Shaping
[11:37.820 --> 11:44.140]  Fire with Shango Lose and the Cannabis Cultivation and Sciences podcast with Tad Hussey.
[11:44.140 --> 11:49.300]  There are many great resources for expanding your cannabis knowledge, but none of this
[11:49.300 --> 11:51.700]  information is going to be delivered to your lap.
[11:51.700 --> 11:55.180]  You have to do a little bit of work to go find the knowledge you need.
[11:55.180 --> 11:59.280]  And like I said earlier, most of that knowledge you find on social media is going to cause
[11:59.280 --> 12:02.060]  more problems than it will actually correct.
[12:02.060 --> 12:07.540]  So I highly recommend that you learn through books and through podcasting and through educated
[12:07.540 --> 12:09.620]  cannabis cultivators.
[12:09.620 --> 12:14.340]  Now don't get me wrong, there are some very qualified, very educated, very knowledgeable
[12:14.340 --> 12:20.340]  cannabis enthusiasts online, but it is very challenging sorting through the bullshit.
[12:20.340 --> 12:26.620]  So if you do choose to take your cannabis information from online sources, please be
[12:26.620 --> 12:28.120]  very careful.
[12:28.120 --> 12:30.940]  Do some cross-referencing, do some checking.
[12:30.940 --> 12:33.780]  Don't ever feel bad to ask somebody why.
[12:33.780 --> 12:38.920]  If somebody says, that plant needs Epsom salts, you can say, why do you feel that way?
[12:38.920 --> 12:43.180]  If they cannot tell you why that plant needs Epsom salts, they probably don't know that
[12:43.180 --> 12:45.580]  that plant needs Epsom salts.
[12:45.580 --> 12:48.860]  Most of the time people say, that plant needs this.
[12:48.860 --> 12:50.420]  And you say, why does it need that?
[12:50.420 --> 12:55.260]  And they go, well, my plant looked like yours and my friend told me to try that and it worked.
[12:55.260 --> 12:56.500]  There's no science behind it.
[12:56.500 --> 12:58.180]  There's no basis behind it.
[12:58.180 --> 12:59.540]  There's no real reason.
[12:59.980 --> 13:04.140]  My buddy did it and it worked, so I think you should try it too.
[13:04.140 --> 13:08.700]  Sometimes that may work for you, but we don't know what was going on in that guy's grow
[13:08.700 --> 13:09.700]  room.
[13:09.700 --> 13:12.460]  We don't know what was going on in his buddy's grow room and we don't know what's going on
[13:12.460 --> 13:13.660]  in your grow room.
[13:13.660 --> 13:17.020]  And it could all be three completely different problems.
[13:17.020 --> 13:18.660]  Maybe it worked for two guys.
[13:18.660 --> 13:21.860]  Yours may look similar, but it is a completely different thing.
[13:21.860 --> 13:27.260]  So the solution that guy gave you could really double and compound the original problem.
[13:27.260 --> 13:28.260]  So we have to be careful.
[13:28.260 --> 13:33.580]  We have to know that we are correctly diagnosing a problem before we try correcting anything.
[13:33.580 --> 13:34.620]  So be very careful.
[13:34.620 --> 13:37.700]  Be very discerning with the information you get from the internet.
[13:37.700 --> 13:42.460]  I really suggest you get most of your information from books and podcasts.
[13:42.460 --> 13:44.380]  What I like about books is they are visual.
[13:44.380 --> 13:45.380]  We can see them.
[13:45.380 --> 13:49.140]  We can open up a page and see a picture of a leaf with a problem.
[13:49.140 --> 13:50.220]  That's what it looks like.
[13:50.220 --> 13:51.820]  There's a picture of a spider mite.
[13:51.820 --> 13:53.060]  That's what it looks like.
[13:53.060 --> 13:55.740]  What I really like about podcasting is you can learn.
[13:55.740 --> 13:58.500]  You might be listening to me while you're in the car right now.
[13:58.500 --> 14:02.060]  You could be driving to work and getting a free cannabis education.
[14:02.060 --> 14:06.820]  You could be working in a grow with your hands on plants and learning about cannabis at the
[14:06.820 --> 14:07.820]  same time.
[14:07.820 --> 14:09.860]  So that's really what I enjoy about podcasting.
[14:09.860 --> 14:15.980]  Also, most podcasters are knowledgeable enough to follow their advice.
[14:15.980 --> 14:20.820]  I feel like most people who have gotten far enough to set up a podcast and dedicate time
[14:20.820 --> 14:25.460]  and create an RSS feed and create an episode, most of those people should be qualified to
[14:25.460 --> 14:28.500]  give out useful cannabis advice.
[14:28.500 --> 14:32.880]  But again, we have to be careful with every piece of information we are given because
[14:32.880 --> 14:36.940]  sometimes we have just enough knowledge to be dangerous.
[14:36.940 --> 14:40.080]  Now one more thing I really want to make sure I mention while we are talking about setting
[14:40.080 --> 14:46.060]  ourselves up for success is keeping a journal and taking notes and having a calendar and
[14:46.060 --> 14:47.920]  a schedule.
[14:47.920 --> 14:50.260]  Start a schedule before your grow.
[14:50.260 --> 14:52.020]  Set yourself up for success.
[14:52.020 --> 14:53.620]  How long are you going to veg?
[14:53.620 --> 14:55.020]  When are you going to flower?
[14:55.020 --> 14:58.420]  If you start flowering at this day, when will the plants be done?
[14:58.420 --> 15:01.900]  If the plants are done at that day, when do you need to start flushing?
[15:01.900 --> 15:05.920]  If you start flowering on this day, when should I defoliate?
[15:05.920 --> 15:07.260]  When should I pop and twist?
[15:07.260 --> 15:08.980]  When should I put on the first net?
[15:08.980 --> 15:11.840]  When should I start adding bloom boosters to my nutrient feed?
[15:11.840 --> 15:14.540]  When should I start reducing nitrogen?
[15:14.540 --> 15:15.640]  Make a calendar.
[15:15.640 --> 15:16.860]  Have a schedule.
[15:16.860 --> 15:17.860]  Plan ahead.
[15:17.860 --> 15:20.180]  Set yourself up for success.
[15:20.180 --> 15:24.380]  If you've got a calendar on the wall, on the inside or outside of your grow room that says,
[15:24.740 --> 15:27.100]  on this day I should probably defoliate.
[15:27.100 --> 15:29.340]  On this day I need to put up another net.
[15:29.340 --> 15:33.060]  On this day begin flushing because on this day we harvest.
[15:33.060 --> 15:35.740]  It will save you so much headache in the future.
[15:35.740 --> 15:39.100]  When the plants start looking ripe, you won't have to go, well how long have they been in
[15:39.100 --> 15:40.100]  flower?
[15:40.100 --> 15:41.340]  When should I start flushing?
[15:41.340 --> 15:45.900]  You should have decided that before you even put the plants into flower.
[15:45.900 --> 15:50.300]  If you've got an eight week cultivar, write down day one, week one, and then look at the
[15:50.300 --> 15:51.300]  calendar.
[15:51.300 --> 15:52.500]  Count down eight weeks.
[15:52.500 --> 15:54.140]  Six weeks in, start flushing.
[15:54.180 --> 15:55.980]  You can cut that shit down at the end of eight weeks.
[15:55.980 --> 15:59.220]  It shouldn't be that challenging if you have a plan.
[15:59.220 --> 16:01.740]  Most of us are running nine or 10 week plants.
[16:01.740 --> 16:04.140]  Pick nine weeks, 63 days.
[16:04.140 --> 16:06.780]  That means at the end of day 50, start flushing.
[16:06.780 --> 16:07.780]  Write it down.
[16:07.780 --> 16:08.780]  Pay attention.
[16:08.780 --> 16:13.460]  Set yourself up for success and you will eliminate so many of the problems that we keep running
[16:13.460 --> 16:15.020]  into in the garden.
[16:15.020 --> 16:16.020]  You guys, my throat is dry.
[16:16.020 --> 16:17.020]  My voice is fucked up.
[16:17.020 --> 16:18.060]  I'm going to press pause.
[16:18.060 --> 16:20.100]  I'm going to take about 72 dabs.
[16:20.100 --> 16:21.500]  I'm going to take a big fat drink.
[16:21.660 --> 16:24.860]  Then I'm going to come back and I'm going to read a listener email.
[16:24.860 --> 16:25.860]  Take a dab while I'm gone.
[16:25.860 --> 16:27.420]  All right, podcast world.
[16:27.420 --> 16:28.420]  I am back.
[16:28.420 --> 16:30.900]  I am well hydrated and heavily medicated.
[16:30.900 --> 16:35.420]  I took a couple of fat dabs of some secret Cush Mints live batter.
[16:35.420 --> 16:38.700]  This is a blend of secret cookie and Cush Mints.
[16:38.700 --> 16:42.980]  On the package, they described the flavor as oatmeal, raisin, and sugar cookie.
[16:42.980 --> 16:47.180]  I think it tastes like a Little Debbie oatmeal cream pie.
[16:47.180 --> 16:50.540]  I know that's a really weird description, but it's got that oatmeal flavor to it, but
[16:50.580 --> 16:54.300]  then there is something kind of sweet, kind of like the frosting part.
[16:54.300 --> 16:58.020]  I really enjoy the secret Cush Mints live batter.
[16:58.020 --> 16:59.500]  This one kind of makes me sit down.
[16:59.500 --> 17:03.620]  This one is like the put you on your ass, sit you back in your chair concentrate, and
[17:03.620 --> 17:05.100]  I really enjoy it.
[17:05.100 --> 17:08.780]  One thing that I thought was weird is I took two dabs and now I am freezing cold.
[17:08.780 --> 17:10.740]  I'm usually not real cold after a dab.
[17:10.740 --> 17:14.140]  Of course, it is like 68 degrees in this house right now, so that could have something to
[17:14.140 --> 17:17.020]  do with it, but I just took a fat dab and now I'm real cold.
[17:17.020 --> 17:19.900]  So we're going to record a shivery podcast here.
[17:19.940 --> 17:22.100]  I said that I was going to read an email.
[17:22.100 --> 17:23.300]  Let's jump right into that part.
[17:23.300 --> 17:25.900]  Hopefully I will warm up as we go.
[17:25.900 --> 17:28.540]  This email goes just like this.
[17:28.540 --> 17:32.500]  Rasta Jeff, this may be a good one to answer on the show.
[17:32.500 --> 17:37.940]  I have had shitty luck with cloning this grow, so I took a bunch of my cuts of my HW Fruit
[17:37.940 --> 17:41.940]  Punch before flipping it over into flour and they did not make it.
[17:41.940 --> 17:44.140]  I think my heat was not dialed in.
[17:44.140 --> 17:46.260]  That could likely be the cause.
[17:46.260 --> 17:49.860]  It goes on to say, well, I went ahead and grabbed a couple more clones and I have them
[17:49.860 --> 17:53.740]  outside in the shade in this hot ass part of the country.
[17:53.740 --> 17:58.540]  I don't know where you are, but I wish I was there because it is cold as shit here in Southern
[17:58.540 --> 18:00.340]  Colorado today.
[18:00.340 --> 18:01.340]  The message goes on.
[18:01.340 --> 18:05.660]  It says, these clones have already lasted longer, but not yet rooted.
[18:05.660 --> 18:08.940]  So you've got some clones, they're outdoors and they're living.
[18:08.940 --> 18:10.940]  I'm not sure what type of environment you've got them in.
[18:10.940 --> 18:11.940]  I don't know what they're in.
[18:11.940 --> 18:12.940]  I don't know if they're in a dome.
[18:12.940 --> 18:13.940]  I don't know if they're in plugs.
[18:13.940 --> 18:15.460]  I don't know if they're straight into the dirt.
[18:15.660 --> 18:16.660]  I have a lot of questions.
[18:16.660 --> 18:21.860]  I'm confused, but it goes on to say, these seem to take a while anyway.
[18:21.860 --> 18:25.380]  So my question is, when I checked the plugs, oh, we've got plugs.
[18:25.380 --> 18:28.580]  I saw a couple of tiny bugs crawling on the bottom.
[18:28.580 --> 18:29.580]  All right.
[18:29.580 --> 18:30.620]  So that's very likely to happen.
[18:30.620 --> 18:33.140]  You've got cannabis plants outside.
[18:33.140 --> 18:34.780]  You've got a nice warm climate.
[18:34.780 --> 18:35.940]  You're giving them water.
[18:35.940 --> 18:39.180]  You were creating the perfect environment for some buggies to come hang out.
[18:39.180 --> 18:43.500]  And now you have seen, it says, when I checked the plugs, I saw a couple of tiny bugs crawling
[18:43.500 --> 18:45.000]  on the bottom.
[18:45.040 --> 18:46.040]  That is not a good sign.
[18:46.040 --> 18:48.560]  You are definitely not setting yourself up for success.
[18:48.560 --> 18:51.560]  We have already got struggle plants here, but there's more.
[18:51.560 --> 18:52.560]  The message goes on.
[18:52.560 --> 18:58.160]  It says, if these do indeed make it, what would you suggest I do to treat these plants
[18:58.160 --> 19:01.280]  before I bring them inside?
[19:01.280 --> 19:07.640]  I personally would not bring plants from outdoors to the indoors, especially already knowing
[19:07.640 --> 19:10.160]  for sure that you have got bugs.
[19:10.160 --> 19:15.360]  Because you've got a pre-plant area, like a quarantine, like an entry or an intake area
[19:15.360 --> 19:18.760]  that is not your main grow, I would not bring them in.
[19:18.760 --> 19:21.640]  We already know there are bugs on these plants.
[19:21.640 --> 19:23.400]  We're already starting with the problem.
[19:23.400 --> 19:26.760]  These plants already need special attention and special treatment.
[19:26.760 --> 19:30.200]  The first thing we need to do is identify the pest.
[19:30.200 --> 19:34.880]  In any sort of pest prevention or eradication method, you have to identify the pest or the
[19:34.880 --> 19:36.160]  potential pest.
[19:36.160 --> 19:37.560]  So figure out what you've got.
[19:37.560 --> 19:39.280]  What is that bug?
[19:39.280 --> 19:40.680]  Identify it correctly.
[19:40.680 --> 19:44.920]  Then we need to think about strategies to eliminate that specific pest.
[19:44.920 --> 19:48.200]  Battling those pests outdoors will be a real challenge.
[19:48.200 --> 19:52.160]  So this is where you need to consider bringing those clones indoors.
[19:52.160 --> 19:53.480]  That's where it starts getting risky.
[19:53.480 --> 19:57.160]  Now you're bringing contaminated plants into your grow environment.
[19:57.160 --> 20:02.240]  Unless you've got that pre-area or a quarantined area or a little intake area, sort of like
[20:02.240 --> 20:06.180]  a holding cell or a triage, unless you've got something like that where these plants
[20:06.180 --> 20:10.820]  that are being treated can be held, I would not recommend bringing them into the grow.
[20:10.820 --> 20:11.820]  You're going to bring in bugs.
[20:11.820 --> 20:12.980]  There are bugs on the plants.
[20:12.980 --> 20:14.180]  They're coming in with your plants.
[20:14.180 --> 20:16.540]  You can't stop that from happening.
[20:16.540 --> 20:20.420]  Even if you do put them in a quarantined room, you're probably going to take those bugs into
[20:20.420 --> 20:22.480]  your main population.
[20:22.480 --> 20:25.900]  Unless these clones are hypercritical, I would not recommend this.
[20:25.900 --> 20:29.180]  If you insist on bringing these clones in, I would do a drench.
[20:29.180 --> 20:31.140]  I would first identify the pest.
[20:31.140 --> 20:33.700]  Then I would identify the appropriate pesticide.
[20:33.700 --> 20:38.500]  Then I would research thoroughly and see if those plants will survive a drench with
[20:38.500 --> 20:39.820]  that pesticide.
[20:39.820 --> 20:43.780]  You're going to mix up a container, however big you need to fit that plant in completely.
[20:43.780 --> 20:47.260]  It needs to be fully submerged, maybe a one gallon, maybe a five gallon.
[20:47.260 --> 20:49.380]  I don't know how big your plant is.
[20:49.380 --> 20:50.860]  Mix that up appropriately.
[20:50.860 --> 20:52.380]  Put a wetting agent in there.
[20:52.380 --> 20:54.060]  Then dunk that plant thoroughly.
[20:54.060 --> 20:55.060]  Wear a rubber glove.
[20:55.060 --> 20:58.300]  Maybe wear a long arm glove if you're going to go deep into the water.
[20:58.300 --> 20:59.300]  Wear a glove.
[20:59.300 --> 21:00.300]  Cover yourself up.
[21:00.300 --> 21:01.300]  Be safe.
[21:01.300 --> 21:03.380]  Swish that plant around in there for a few seconds.
[21:03.380 --> 21:05.940]  Watch the bugs float up off the top of that plant.
[21:05.940 --> 21:07.700]  They're going to float to the surface.
[21:07.700 --> 21:09.540]  Watch the bugs try to swim away.
[21:09.540 --> 21:11.700]  They're getting pesticide and water on them.
[21:11.700 --> 21:12.700]  Then take it out.
[21:12.700 --> 21:16.640]  I am not sure what type of pesticide you are going to choose to use for this.
[21:16.640 --> 21:22.060]  You may need to dunk your plant into clean water and rinse that pesticide off.
[21:22.060 --> 21:24.380]  You may not need to do that.
[21:24.380 --> 21:28.660]  Some of the pesticides you choose to use may cause phytotoxicity, which means when we turn
[21:28.660 --> 21:32.940]  the lights back on, that light is going to react with the chemical in that plant, probably
[21:33.000 --> 21:37.460]  an oil, and it will create a reaction that will destroy your plants.
[21:37.460 --> 21:38.660]  So be careful.
[21:38.660 --> 21:40.620]  Research the appropriate pesticides.
[21:40.620 --> 21:42.140]  See if you can do a dunk.
[21:42.140 --> 21:45.260]  See if a rinse is recommended after that dunk.
[21:45.260 --> 21:50.020]  Maybe test your pesticide application on one or two plants before you destroy the entire
[21:50.020 --> 21:51.020]  tray.
[21:51.020 --> 21:53.420]  So again, the first step is identify the pest.
[21:53.420 --> 21:57.780]  The second step is to find the appropriate solution for that pest.
[21:57.780 --> 21:59.320]  Then treat carefully.
[21:59.320 --> 22:00.360]  Treat accordingly.
[22:00.360 --> 22:06.140]  And maybe try with just a couple of plants in case your strategy causes severe problems.
[22:06.140 --> 22:08.080]  I don't know how important these clones are.
[22:08.080 --> 22:09.760]  I don't know how much money you want to spend on pesticides.
[22:09.760 --> 22:13.600]  I don't know how much time you want to spend trying to battle these bugs.
[22:13.600 --> 22:16.960]  But be very careful not to get those bugs into your general population.
[22:16.960 --> 22:19.840]  Again, I would bring them into a quarantined area.
[22:19.840 --> 22:21.440]  Make sure you get rid of the pests.
[22:21.440 --> 22:23.720]  Treat them for multiple days, multiple times.
[22:23.720 --> 22:26.640]  Maybe use multiple different pesticides.
[22:26.640 --> 22:29.920]  Bugs develop a resistance to specific pesticides.
[22:29.980 --> 22:33.160]  If you spray the same thing too many times, by the fourth or fifth time, they're just
[22:33.160 --> 22:34.320]  going to open up and drink it.
[22:34.320 --> 22:36.160]  They're going to turn into the Incredible Hulk.
[22:36.160 --> 22:40.800]  They're going to breed more impressive, more destructive bugs in further generations.
[22:40.800 --> 22:42.600]  You're just going to make them stronger.
[22:42.600 --> 22:46.520]  One thing that a bug will never build a resistance to is being eaten.
[22:46.520 --> 22:48.320]  So predator bugs are always an option.
[22:48.320 --> 22:52.680]  If you're using predator bugs in your main grow area, order extras.
[22:52.680 --> 22:54.720]  Take those to your quarantined area.
[22:54.720 --> 22:59.360]  Overload that new plant with predator bugs and watch those bad bitches eat those undesirable
[22:59.400 --> 23:00.400]  pests.
[23:00.400 --> 23:02.320]  Honestly, I wouldn't do it.
[23:02.320 --> 23:04.280]  My answer is kill it with fire.
[23:04.280 --> 23:05.520]  The clones and the bugs.
[23:05.520 --> 23:09.400]  I wouldn't bring them from outdoors to indoors, but I don't know how critical they are to
[23:09.400 --> 23:10.400]  you.
[23:10.400 --> 23:11.400]  So identify the bug.
[23:11.400 --> 23:15.200]  Find either the correct pesticide or the correct predator for that bug.
[23:15.200 --> 23:17.080]  Then treat carefully.
[23:17.080 --> 23:19.440]  Don't treat the entire population at once.
[23:19.440 --> 23:22.760]  Maybe see if you might kill the plants with the pesticides you're using.
[23:22.760 --> 23:24.600]  Make sure you're not going to destroy anything.
[23:24.600 --> 23:27.240]  Then continue once you've done a little bit of testing.
[23:27.240 --> 23:28.960]  Honestly, I wouldn't bring them in.
[23:28.960 --> 23:33.920]  Unless you absolutely need these plants, unless you're absolutely in love with these genetics,
[23:33.920 --> 23:35.280]  I would just let it go.
[23:35.280 --> 23:40.120]  You are not setting yourself up for success by bringing problematic clones into your grow.
[23:40.120 --> 23:42.360]  All right, I want to thank you for the great email.
[23:42.360 --> 23:46.040]  It doesn't say if you want me to say your name or not, so I'm going to leave you anonymous.
[23:46.040 --> 23:47.560]  Thanks for all of the continued support.
[23:47.560 --> 23:48.560]  I know who you are.
[23:48.560 --> 23:49.560]  I keep seeing your name.
[23:49.560 --> 23:50.560]  Thank you.
[23:50.560 --> 23:51.560]  I do appreciate it.
