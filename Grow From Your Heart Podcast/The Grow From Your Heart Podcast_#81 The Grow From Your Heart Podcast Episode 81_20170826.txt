[00:17.790 --> 00:20.250]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[00:20.250 --> 00:21.990]  It's time for episode number 81
[00:21.990 --> 00:23.590]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:23.590 --> 00:27.570]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.570 --> 00:28.630]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:28.630 --> 00:29.890]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.890 --> 00:31.730]  if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber,
[00:31.730 --> 00:33.370]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone
[00:33.370 --> 00:35.470]  who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:35.470 --> 00:38.070]  this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:39.010 --> 00:39.870]  I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[00:39.870 --> 00:40.870]  Thanks again for joining me.
[00:40.870 --> 00:43.010]  As always, I wanna send a huge thank you shout out
[00:43.010 --> 00:43.950]  to the Mystic Roots Band
[00:43.950 --> 00:45.710]  for letting me use their music on the show.
[00:45.770 --> 00:49.270]  Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:49.270 --> 00:50.170]  How's everybody doing today?
[00:50.170 --> 00:51.670]  It is the first of the month.
[00:51.670 --> 00:53.030]  Before we get too far into the show,
[00:53.030 --> 00:54.030]  let me give you guys a warning.
[00:54.030 --> 00:55.910]  There may be some loud pops and sizzles
[00:55.910 --> 00:57.150]  in the background here.
[00:57.150 --> 00:58.270]  It's the 1st of July.
[00:58.270 --> 01:00.110]  Everybody's getting prepared for the 4th of July.
[01:00.110 --> 01:01.710]  Well, that music was loud, I'm sorry.
[01:01.710 --> 01:03.230]  It's the 1st of July as we record.
[01:03.230 --> 01:04.210]  Everybody in my neighborhood
[01:04.210 --> 01:07.110]  is already begun celebrating the 4th of July.
[01:07.110 --> 01:09.870]  So you'll hear some M80s, some mortars go off.
[01:09.870 --> 01:11.630]  You'll hear some all kinds of great shit
[01:11.630 --> 01:13.710]  happening in the background here as we record.
[01:13.710 --> 01:15.430]  It's been scaring the shit out of me
[01:15.430 --> 01:16.510]  for the past couple of hours.
[01:16.510 --> 01:19.350]  I keep forgetting that it's right near the 4th of July
[01:19.350 --> 01:20.750]  and I keep hearing these loud booms
[01:20.750 --> 01:21.830]  and I wanna get up and go look.
[01:21.830 --> 01:23.190]  And every time I think, I'm gonna go look,
[01:23.190 --> 01:26.050]  I realize that's just damn fireworks.
[01:26.050 --> 01:28.270]  So at least I hope it's fireworks.
[01:28.270 --> 01:30.550]  I kind of live in not the best neighborhood in the world.
[01:30.550 --> 01:31.670]  So I like this time of year
[01:31.670 --> 01:33.610]  because then you can just really convince yourself
[01:33.610 --> 01:36.330]  that that boom was fireworks this one time.
[01:36.330 --> 01:38.550]  So guys, thanks for joining me.
[01:38.550 --> 01:39.490]  Happy 1st of the month.
[01:39.490 --> 01:41.190]  This will probably come out on Monday.
[01:41.190 --> 01:43.430]  So that'll be, fuck, I won't even know the date.
[01:43.430 --> 01:44.630]  Whatever, guys, it'll be Monday.
[01:44.630 --> 01:46.630]  Happy Monday as you listen to this.
[01:46.630 --> 01:47.470]  Before we get too far,

[02:24.470 --> 02:26.150]  It'll really help them out.
[02:26.150 --> 02:28.470]  All right, let me also mention before we go too far,
[02:28.470 --> 02:30.370]  I am on Periscope once again.
[02:30.370 --> 02:31.950]  There's an application called Periscope
[02:31.950 --> 02:34.230]  where we can record everything live.
[02:34.230 --> 02:35.830]  I am broadcasting live to,
[02:35.830 --> 02:37.310]  there are 10 people watching me right now.
[02:37.310 --> 02:40.430]  There'll be hopefully a few more by the end of the show.
[02:40.430 --> 02:41.930]  If you ever want to watch me on Periscope,
[02:41.930 --> 02:43.030]  I kind of record randomly.
[02:43.030 --> 02:44.150]  I don't set a good schedule.
[02:44.150 --> 02:45.470]  I'm going to have to set a schedule
[02:45.470 --> 02:47.390]  so that I can get you guys on Periscope with me.
[02:47.390 --> 02:49.270]  We'll start making a date of it.
[02:49.270 --> 02:51.350]  But right now, to the people that are on Periscope watching,
[02:51.350 --> 02:53.190]  you guys, I'm not gonna pay attention to the comments
[02:53.190 --> 02:54.930]  until toward the end of the show.
[02:54.930 --> 02:57.230]  I'm going to record about a 20 minute show
[02:57.230 --> 02:58.630]  and then I'll open it up for questions
[02:58.630 --> 03:00.710]  and I will accept questions from my viewers
[03:00.710 --> 03:02.230]  that are on Periscope.
[03:02.230 --> 03:04.130]  So I'm gonna have to make this a regular thing
[03:04.130 --> 03:05.150]  so that I can schedule this
[03:05.150 --> 03:06.830]  so that my friends and fans can get on here
[03:06.830 --> 03:08.190]  and listen at the proper time
[03:08.190 --> 03:09.710]  and watch me on Periscope and interact.
[03:09.710 --> 03:11.910]  But tonight, this is kind of my test run.
[03:11.910 --> 03:14.110]  I didn't want to advertise that I was gonna do this
[03:14.110 --> 03:16.990]  because I didn't want to get bombarded and get overwhelmed.
[03:16.990 --> 03:18.590]  But at the end of this podcast,
[03:18.590 --> 03:19.710]  once I do my news articles
[03:19.710 --> 03:21.630]  and talk about the email I received,
[03:21.630 --> 03:24.350]  I will open up the floor for questions
[03:24.350 --> 03:25.990]  from my Periscope viewers.
[03:25.990 --> 03:28.890]  So let me keep the show going.
[03:28.890 --> 03:30.110]  Much respect to the sponsors,
[03:30.110 --> 03:31.510]  to Hydro and or Growing Supplies
[03:31.510 --> 03:32.590]  for making the show possible.
[03:32.590 --> 03:34.270]  They do help me out.
[03:34.270 --> 03:35.910]  If you are interested in sponsoring the show,
[03:35.910 --> 03:36.910]  send me an email.
[03:36.910 --> 03:38.350]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[03:38.350 --> 03:41.670]  I'll get you all of the information that you need.
[03:42.430 --> 03:44.410]  Let's see, where do we want to start?
[03:46.070 --> 03:48.030]  Actually, let's go, it's the first of the month.
[03:48.030 --> 03:48.910]  I already mentioned that.
[03:48.910 --> 03:50.470]  And I talked about the fireworks.
[03:50.470 --> 03:51.550]  I talked about Periscope.
[03:51.550 --> 03:52.670]  So since it's the first of the month,
[03:52.670 --> 03:54.390]  let's jump right into this news article.
[03:54.390 --> 03:55.550]  Here we go.
[03:55.550 --> 03:56.990]  Today is the first of the month.
[03:56.990 --> 04:00.590]  And it is also the first day.
[04:00.590 --> 04:01.850]  Let me just read the article to you.
[04:01.850 --> 04:04.130]  It says, Oregon opens door to legal pot.
[04:04.130 --> 04:06.210]  Retail sales still in the works.
[04:06.210 --> 04:08.950]  This article is by Jeff Bernard from the Associated Press.
[04:08.950 --> 04:11.510]  And of course, I found it on the cannabis.
[04:12.350 --> 04:14.230]  Shout out to our friends at The Cannabis.
[04:14.230 --> 04:16.270]  The article says, Williams, Oregon.
[04:16.270 --> 04:18.390]  42 years after Oregon became the first state
[04:18.390 --> 04:20.550]  to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana,
[04:20.550 --> 04:23.170]  the state is taking its first steps along a road
[04:23.170 --> 04:24.630]  leading to state licensed stores
[04:24.630 --> 04:27.670]  selling limited amounts of it to anyone over 21.
[04:27.670 --> 04:29.030]  Oregon has long been a pioneer
[04:29.030 --> 04:31.770]  on sensible marijuana policy, said Anthony Johnson,
[04:31.770 --> 04:33.310]  chief pioneer on Measure 91,
[04:33.310 --> 04:35.510]  which on Wednesday makes Oregon the fourth state
[04:35.510 --> 04:38.750]  to adopt laws legalizing recreational use of cannabis
[04:38.750 --> 04:40.710]  for people old enough to drink.
[04:40.710 --> 04:41.550]  That's right, you guys.
[04:41.550 --> 04:45.270]  Today, July 1st, 2015, the state of Oregon
[04:45.270 --> 04:49.630]  has legalized recreational cannabis for folks 21 and over.
[04:49.630 --> 04:50.470]  It's a great thing.
[04:50.470 --> 04:51.290]  Let's all celebrate that.
[04:51.290 --> 04:52.130]  You know what?
[04:52.130 --> 04:53.430]  I haven't taken a dab on the show lately.
[04:53.430 --> 04:56.290]  I think that is grounds to take a celebration dab.
[04:56.290 --> 04:57.190]  So join me.
[04:57.190 --> 05:00.310]  I'm gonna give you guys a couple seconds to get a dab ready.
[05:00.310 --> 05:01.790]  I'm gonna do a medium sized dab here.
[05:01.790 --> 05:03.510]  Not one of those big fat dabs I like to do
[05:03.510 --> 05:05.110]  because I don't wanna be choking on the show here.
[05:05.110 --> 05:06.650]  We got a show to run.
[05:06.650 --> 05:09.430]  So this dab I'm going to take is in celebration
[05:09.470 --> 05:11.790]  of all of my friends in Oregon who can now smoke
[05:11.790 --> 05:15.290]  and possess recreational cannabis without worry of arrest,
[05:15.290 --> 05:17.030]  without any sort of trouble from the police.
[05:17.030 --> 05:18.390]  I'm gonna do a dab for you guys.
[05:18.390 --> 05:20.270]  If you're on Periscope, do a dab with me.
[05:20.270 --> 05:22.230]  If you're listening to the podcast, do a dab with me.
[05:22.230 --> 05:23.070]  Join me.
[05:34.220 --> 05:35.900]  All right, shout out to the Garden of Whedon
[05:35.900 --> 05:37.040]  for delicious dabs.
[05:37.040 --> 05:38.580]  I really appreciate that.
[05:38.580 --> 05:40.900]  All right, we'll continue with the article.
[05:40.900 --> 05:42.060]  Anthony Johnson added,
[05:42.060 --> 05:45.060]  though he doesn't expect much increased demand for it,
[05:45.060 --> 05:46.980]  he means for cannabis.
[05:46.980 --> 05:47.820]  And then he goes on to say,
[05:47.820 --> 05:49.620]  smoking it in public is illegal,
[05:49.620 --> 05:51.740]  but in Portland, police are discouraging residents
[05:51.740 --> 05:54.540]  from calling 911 to report pot smokers.
[05:54.540 --> 05:56.420]  The Portland chapter of National Organization
[05:56.420 --> 05:59.620]  for the Reform of Marijuana Laws posted on its website
[05:59.620 --> 06:01.700]  that it would have a tent set up at the west side
[06:01.700 --> 06:04.220]  of the Burnside Bridge for a midnight countdown
[06:04.220 --> 06:06.420]  to the end of marijuana prohibition.
[06:06.420 --> 06:09.000]  The site offers a big neon sign in the shape of Oregon
[06:09.000 --> 06:12.780]  as a background for selfies of revelers who light up.
[06:12.780 --> 06:15.260]  Oh, I can just imagine that, you guys, a big ass sign
[06:15.260 --> 06:17.180]  shaped like Oregon with people just dabbing out
[06:17.260 --> 06:18.300]  and puffing down in front of it.
[06:18.300 --> 06:19.940]  That's pretty great.
[06:19.940 --> 06:20.940]  I'll continue with the article.
[06:20.940 --> 06:23.700]  It says, adults will be allowed to possess
[06:23.700 --> 06:26.580]  up to a half a pound and grow four plants,
[06:26.580 --> 06:29.320]  but not yet to buy or sell it.
[06:29.320 --> 06:32.140]  It will be a few months to more than a year
[06:32.140 --> 06:33.320]  before it is legal to sell,
[06:33.320 --> 06:36.020]  and then only with a state permit.
[06:36.020 --> 06:38.540]  So right now it says adults will be allowed to possess
[06:38.540 --> 06:40.060]  up to a pound and they'll be allowed
[06:40.060 --> 06:41.700]  to grow up to four plants.
[06:41.700 --> 06:43.820]  We talked about the last episode,
[06:43.820 --> 06:46.080]  that pound or that half a pound, I'm sorry,
[06:46.080 --> 06:48.240]  that half a pound has to stay at home
[06:48.240 --> 06:51.000]  and you're allowed to carry up to one ounce with you.
[06:51.000 --> 06:52.880]  And just in case you were confused,
[06:52.880 --> 06:55.520]  Oregon issued a nice little statement that showed you
[06:55.520 --> 06:58.200]  that one ounce of cannabis is approximately the size
[06:58.200 --> 06:59.880]  of one voodoo donut.
[06:59.880 --> 07:02.800]  So that's how much you're allowed to carry around with you.
[07:02.800 --> 07:04.280]  The article goes on to say,
[07:04.280 --> 07:06.880]  the legislature is continuing, considering, I'm sorry,
[07:06.880 --> 07:09.120]  the legislature is considering a bill
[07:09.120 --> 07:10.960]  to allow medical marijuana dispensaries
[07:10.960 --> 07:13.560]  to start selling small amounts to anyone 21 and over
[07:13.560 --> 07:18.560]  on October 1st in order to get over the incongruity
[07:18.580 --> 07:21.600]  of marijuana being legal to have it and grow,
[07:21.600 --> 07:22.640]  but not to buy.
[07:22.640 --> 07:24.480]  Sorry, I stumbled over that word, you guys.
[07:24.480 --> 07:26.700]  A state regulated retail system is not expected
[07:26.700 --> 07:29.200]  to be fully up and running until late next year.
[07:29.200 --> 07:31.320]  Growers are expected to be able to start applying
[07:31.320 --> 07:34.420]  for licenses in January with permits for processors,
[07:34.420 --> 07:38.080]  wholesalers, and retailers rolling out in succession.
[07:38.080 --> 07:39.880]  Growers are already gearing up,
[07:39.880 --> 07:41.800]  particularly in Southern Oregon,
[07:41.800 --> 07:44.720]  long known as a prime climate for outdoor growing.
[07:44.720 --> 07:47.240]  Jackson County Building Services Director, Kelly Madding,
[07:47.240 --> 07:49.320]  said they have received 17 complaints
[07:49.320 --> 07:51.600]  over the past six months of marijuana growers
[07:51.600 --> 07:53.760]  violating land use laws.
[07:53.760 --> 07:55.720]  Trees along a creek were cut down
[07:55.720 --> 07:58.220]  and a vernal pool habitat for a protected species
[07:58.220 --> 08:00.120]  of freshwater shrimp was bulldozed.
[08:00.120 --> 08:02.120]  Four citations have been issued.
[08:02.120 --> 08:03.300]  Guys, if you're gonna grow cannabis
[08:03.300 --> 08:05.200]  and you're gonna do it out in somebody's land
[08:05.200 --> 08:08.580]  or out in some land, be aware of what you're doing.
[08:08.580 --> 08:10.120]  Be mindful of what you're destroying.
[08:10.120 --> 08:12.360]  Don't go fucking bulldoze a lake.
[08:12.360 --> 08:13.360]  That's ridiculous.
[08:13.360 --> 08:14.880]  Don't do that kind of shit.
[08:14.880 --> 08:17.120]  And don't cut down a bunch of trees ridiculously
[08:17.120 --> 08:19.600]  and irresponsibly, especially on somebody else's land.
[08:19.600 --> 08:21.920]  Pay attention to what you're doing.
[08:21.920 --> 08:23.440]  Your profit and your cannabis crop
[08:23.440 --> 08:26.000]  comes second to our environment.
[08:26.000 --> 08:28.600]  All right, with the legalization of recreational marijuana,
[08:28.600 --> 08:30.800]  I think that we're seeing a move to our area
[08:30.800 --> 08:33.880]  by people who may be from out of state, out of the area,
[08:33.880 --> 08:36.600]  who don't really know or understand our land use laws
[08:36.600 --> 08:39.000]  and our environmental protection, she said.
[08:39.000 --> 08:41.280]  Once a month, veteran medical marijuana growers
[08:41.280 --> 08:44.080]  and hopeful newbies gather in the Old Grange Hall
[08:44.080 --> 08:46.400]  in the community of Williams to hear the latest updates
[08:46.400 --> 08:50.120]  on the legislature's process on framing regulations
[08:50.120 --> 08:53.680]  and tips on how to grow healthy, happy marijuana plants.
[08:53.680 --> 08:55.600]  It's a really hostile business environment,
[08:55.600 --> 08:58.160]  but things are improving, said Cedar Gray,
[08:58.160 --> 09:00.360]  the Growers Guild president and a local home builder
[09:00.360 --> 09:02.520]  who, along with his wife, grow medical marijuana
[09:02.520 --> 09:05.340]  and hope to move into growing for retail.
[09:05.340 --> 09:10.340]  So today is the first day, but you cannot buy it in a store
[09:10.340 --> 09:11.940]  and it's going to be a year
[09:11.940 --> 09:14.860]  before you're able to buy cannabis in a store,
[09:14.860 --> 09:16.060]  but you're able to grow it
[09:16.060 --> 09:18.260]  and it looks like you're able to give it away.
[09:18.260 --> 09:20.060]  So big shout out to Oregon.
[09:21.180 --> 09:22.020]  I'm proud of them.
[09:22.020 --> 09:24.180]  They're the fourth state to have recreational cannabis.
[09:24.180 --> 09:25.460]  We are on our way, you guys.
[09:25.460 --> 09:26.740]  There are only so many states left
[09:26.740 --> 09:28.500]  and they can't all fight us.
[09:28.500 --> 09:32.420]  So that takes me to another thing I wanted to read.
[09:32.420 --> 09:33.740]  This kind of drags me over.
[09:33.740 --> 09:34.580]  Where is it?
[09:34.580 --> 09:36.060]  I had it open on the computer here.
[09:36.060 --> 09:37.020]  I'll just find it again, you guys.
[09:37.020 --> 09:37.860]  I'm sorry.
[09:37.860 --> 09:38.700]  Here it is.
[09:38.700 --> 09:39.520]  All right.
[09:39.520 --> 09:40.360]  Somebody sent me an email
[09:40.360 --> 09:45.360]  and I answered half of their question on a previous episode,
[09:45.420 --> 09:47.460]  but I wasn't able to answer the full question
[09:47.460 --> 09:49.340]  because I hadn't had time to think about it,
[09:49.340 --> 09:51.300]  but now I've had time to think about it
[09:51.300 --> 09:54.340]  and Mike and I brainstormed on this a little bit.
[09:54.340 --> 09:56.420]  I'm going to read part of the question
[09:56.420 --> 09:57.780]  because I've already answered part of the question
[09:57.780 --> 09:58.720]  on the show.
[09:58.720 --> 10:01.460]  So this question says, what up Rasta Jeff?
[10:01.460 --> 10:02.300]  My name is Ash.
[10:02.300 --> 10:03.700]  I'm from Oregon and I love listening
[10:03.700 --> 10:04.980]  to the Grow From Your Heart podcast
[10:04.980 --> 10:06.700]  while I'm working in my med garden.
[10:06.700 --> 10:08.820]  I think you give out some great information and tips.
[10:08.820 --> 10:10.860]  So I totally respect your judgment.
[10:10.860 --> 10:11.700]  Dude, awesome.
[10:11.700 --> 10:12.540]  Thanks for saying that.
[10:12.540 --> 10:13.620]  That is really kind of you.
[10:13.620 --> 10:17.500]  Thanks for, first of all, loving and listening to the show
[10:17.500 --> 10:18.900]  and thanks for listening to it
[10:18.900 --> 10:19.940]  while you work in your garden
[10:19.940 --> 10:21.180]  because I want to promote a good vibe
[10:21.180 --> 10:22.020]  while you're in your garden.
[10:22.020 --> 10:23.520]  So that's really cool.
[10:23.520 --> 10:25.900]  Second of all, thanks for respecting my judgment
[10:25.900 --> 10:28.460]  and noticing that I give out great tips.
[10:28.460 --> 10:31.020]  Respect is hard to earn and I appreciate that you respect me
[10:31.020 --> 10:32.740]  and you've got my respect in turn.
[10:32.740 --> 10:33.940]  So your question says,
[10:33.940 --> 10:36.020]  with Oregon about to turn recreational,
[10:36.020 --> 10:37.500]  I was interested in your opinion
[10:37.500 --> 10:39.740]  on niche business opportunities
[10:39.740 --> 10:41.340]  and how recreational might affect
[10:41.340 --> 10:43.500]  medical rules and regulations.
[10:43.500 --> 10:45.380]  And then I answered the second part of your question
[10:45.380 --> 10:46.860]  which was about trim machines.
[10:48.540 --> 10:50.900]  Let me jump into the one part that I can answer
[10:50.900 --> 10:52.100]  without a lot of ranting
[10:52.100 --> 10:54.460]  and then I have some that I wrote down on the other part.
[10:54.460 --> 10:57.900]  You said, how recreational might affect
[10:57.900 --> 10:59.780]  medical rules and regulations?
[10:59.780 --> 11:01.580]  Let me tell you that here in Colorado,
[11:01.580 --> 11:03.900]  when we rolled out recreational cannabis,
[11:03.900 --> 11:05.660]  it looks like we have turned our back
[11:05.660 --> 11:07.580]  on medical marijuana completely.
[11:07.580 --> 11:09.820]  We've given the finger to the medical marijuana patients
[11:09.820 --> 11:10.900]  and this is not me,
[11:10.900 --> 11:12.860]  this is just how I feel about the industry.
[11:12.860 --> 11:14.420]  It looks like the industry does not care
[11:14.420 --> 11:16.640]  about medical marijuana anymore.
[11:16.640 --> 11:18.260]  There's more profit,
[11:18.260 --> 11:22.260]  there's more demand in recreational cannabis.
[11:22.260 --> 11:25.260]  So it feels like the medical side in Colorado
[11:25.260 --> 11:27.820]  is being forgotten and almost be trying,
[11:27.820 --> 11:29.580]  they're almost attempting to eliminate it
[11:29.580 --> 11:30.580]  is what it feels like to me.
[11:30.580 --> 11:32.220]  It's being pushed away.
[11:32.220 --> 11:35.180]  So I feel that the medical rules
[11:35.180 --> 11:38.740]  are going to affect your area probably very similarly.
[11:38.740 --> 11:40.740]  The growers are going to see more profit
[11:40.740 --> 11:42.480]  in the recreational side of things
[11:42.480 --> 11:43.740]  and they'll start getting greedy
[11:43.740 --> 11:46.380]  and they'll stop giving to the patients like they have been.
[11:46.380 --> 11:48.020]  The compassion will go away.
[11:48.860 --> 11:52.220]  They're going to start raising prices
[11:52.220 --> 11:53.940]  and they're going to start selling everything
[11:53.940 --> 11:55.680]  on the commercial side of things
[11:55.680 --> 11:58.300]  instead of the medical side of things.
[11:58.300 --> 11:59.820]  That's what I predict.
[12:00.060 --> 12:01.660]  Now I have to open up a couple of notes
[12:01.660 --> 12:02.760]  that I have in my computer here
[12:02.760 --> 12:04.860]  because I wrote a nice list of things.
[12:04.860 --> 12:06.340]  The other part of your question is
[12:06.340 --> 12:09.780]  what are niche businesses that I think might open up?
[12:09.780 --> 12:12.140]  Maybe some information or tips
[12:12.140 --> 12:15.340]  about since Oregon is going recreational.
[12:15.340 --> 12:16.820]  So I've got a list here.
[12:16.820 --> 12:18.740]  If I can close this one,
[12:18.740 --> 12:20.700]  I will be able to open the next thing.
[12:20.700 --> 12:21.820]  Here we go.
[12:21.820 --> 12:24.020]  I'm fighting with my computer while we're at this.
[12:24.020 --> 12:27.580]  All right, so businesses and business opportunities
[12:27.580 --> 12:30.860]  that will arise with recreational cannabis in your area.
[12:30.860 --> 12:32.300]  And this will go for everywhere,
[12:32.300 --> 12:35.340]  not just Oregon where it has just become
[12:35.340 --> 12:38.700]  recreational legally, recreational legal,
[12:38.700 --> 12:39.740]  that was hard to say,
[12:39.740 --> 12:41.220]  but this will go along with everywhere
[12:41.220 --> 12:42.540]  where cannabis becomes available,
[12:42.540 --> 12:44.500]  medically and recreationally.
[12:44.500 --> 12:47.300]  Businesses that I have seen pop up personally
[12:47.300 --> 12:49.340]  that are attached to cannabis,
[12:49.340 --> 12:51.260]  but this is not a cannabis related business.
[12:51.260 --> 12:53.620]  Say you're not wanting to be in the dispensary game,
[12:53.620 --> 12:54.900]  you don't want to work at a dispensary,
[12:54.900 --> 12:56.680]  you want to open another business.
[12:56.680 --> 12:59.680]  Here's a nice list of opportunities.
[12:59.680 --> 13:02.740]  Electricians, certified electricians
[13:02.740 --> 13:04.760]  are getting paid huge money.
[13:04.760 --> 13:05.640]  If you're an electrician
[13:05.640 --> 13:08.600]  and you're willing to work with a dispensary or a grow,
[13:08.600 --> 13:10.480]  you are making huge money right now.
[13:10.480 --> 13:13.000]  That's the first step I think.
[13:14.240 --> 13:18.440]  When we were able to grow medical cannabis here in Colorado,
[13:18.440 --> 13:20.000]  everybody built a grow room in their house.
[13:20.000 --> 13:21.440]  Everybody that had a MedCard.
[13:21.440 --> 13:22.280]  That's my next,
[13:22.280 --> 13:24.120]  somebody on Periscope just made a great recommendation
[13:24.120 --> 13:26.040]  and that's the next one on my list.
[13:26.680 --> 13:29.480]  Electricians, everyone's going to need an electrician.
[13:29.480 --> 13:30.560]  As soon as it goes commercial
[13:30.560 --> 13:31.800]  and everyone's allowed to grow four,
[13:31.800 --> 13:35.000]  or I keep saying commercial, recreational,
[13:35.000 --> 13:36.160]  as soon as it goes recreational,
[13:36.160 --> 13:38.440]  everyone's allowed to grow four plants in their house.
[13:38.440 --> 13:40.680]  So that means everyone's going to want to build a grow room.
[13:40.680 --> 13:41.800]  Most houses aren't equipped
[13:41.800 --> 13:43.240]  to run a couple thousand watt lights.
[13:43.240 --> 13:45.240]  So everyone's going to need an electrician
[13:45.240 --> 13:46.520]  and then shit's going to go wrong
[13:46.520 --> 13:47.920]  and people are going to want to upgrade.
[13:47.920 --> 13:50.080]  So more electricians all the time.
[13:50.080 --> 13:53.320]  Following electricians would be HVAC technicians.
[13:53.320 --> 13:56.840]  All of the dispensaries have super fancy,
[13:56.840 --> 13:59.080]  super high-tech HVAC systems.
[13:59.080 --> 14:01.600]  If you could design state of the art HVAC systems
[14:01.600 --> 14:04.920]  for grow facilities and or residential grows,
[14:04.920 --> 14:06.880]  that would be very useful.
[14:06.880 --> 14:08.760]  Also construction crews
[14:08.760 --> 14:11.480]  that are familiar with grow room construction.
[14:11.480 --> 14:14.420]  If you had a crew that knew how to build a grow room,
[14:14.420 --> 14:17.420]  if you're a consultant and you can design a nice grow room
[14:17.420 --> 14:19.000]  and you can have a construction crew
[14:19.000 --> 14:22.080]  that knows what the goal is on building a grow room,
[14:22.080 --> 14:23.880]  that would be super helpful.
[14:23.880 --> 14:27.480]  So HVAC, electricians and construction crews
[14:27.480 --> 14:31.080]  to design and build dispensary grows and personal grows.
[14:31.080 --> 14:33.760]  After that, photographers.
[14:33.760 --> 14:34.800]  I know that sounds crazy,
[14:34.800 --> 14:36.720]  but there are two or three photographers
[14:36.720 --> 14:38.720]  in the Colorado cannabis scene
[14:38.720 --> 14:39.920]  that if you told me right now,
[14:39.920 --> 14:41.440]  I need a photographer for cannabis,
[14:41.440 --> 14:42.880]  I would say, is it for like an event
[14:42.880 --> 14:44.960]  where we're photographing people
[14:44.960 --> 14:46.860]  or is it something where we're going to take pictures
[14:46.860 --> 14:47.700]  of plants?
[14:47.700 --> 14:49.320]  And if you said, and I'm going to give two shout outs here,
[14:49.320 --> 14:51.360]  I'm going to give two huge shout outs to two people.
[14:51.360 --> 14:53.840]  If you said, I want to take pictures of cannabis plants,
[14:53.840 --> 14:56.520]  I would definitely recommend a guy named Ripe Richard.
[14:56.520 --> 14:58.360]  He is the guy you want to take pictures
[14:58.360 --> 14:59.680]  of your ganja plants.
[14:59.680 --> 15:01.880]  And if you were taking pictures of a cannabis event
[15:01.880 --> 15:03.900]  where there are people and things happening,
[15:03.900 --> 15:06.600]  you want Kim Sidwell of Cannabis Camera.
[15:06.600 --> 15:07.980]  And they didn't pay me to say that.
[15:07.980 --> 15:09.280]  Those are just who I think of.
[15:09.280 --> 15:12.200]  So what you want to do is become that camera person,
[15:12.200 --> 15:15.100]  the photographer man, photographer woman in your area
[15:15.100 --> 15:16.580]  and master the shit out of that
[15:16.580 --> 15:20.420]  and market yourself as the new industry photographer.
[15:20.420 --> 15:24.580]  Also, another good thing, lawyers, cannabis lawyers.
[15:24.580 --> 15:28.100]  If you can be a lawyer and focus on the cannabis industry
[15:28.100 --> 15:32.400]  and work on either dispensary rules or personal rules
[15:32.400 --> 15:34.020]  or caregiver rules or whatever,
[15:34.020 --> 15:36.100]  people are going to, there are all these new rules
[15:36.100 --> 15:37.180]  and people are going to fuck them up
[15:37.180 --> 15:38.740]  and go to jail and get themselves in trouble
[15:38.740 --> 15:40.700]  trying to mingle with the new rules.
[15:40.700 --> 15:42.460]  Be a lawyer, help those people out.
[15:42.460 --> 15:45.220]  If you're into that, I know that's a lot of schooling
[15:45.220 --> 15:46.960]  and you didn't, you can't just go to school tomorrow,
[15:46.960 --> 15:49.420]  but if you're a lawyer and you're looking for a new niche,
[15:49.420 --> 15:50.580]  this could be it for you.
[15:50.580 --> 15:54.700]  Also accountants, the dispensaries have a lot of money.
[15:54.700 --> 15:56.420]  They need an accountant.
[15:56.420 --> 15:59.700]  Advertising teams, we need good marketing teams
[15:59.700 --> 16:00.540]  for the dispensaries.
[16:00.540 --> 16:02.080]  We need good advertising schemes
[16:02.080 --> 16:04.940]  and advertising campaigns for the dispensaries.
[16:04.940 --> 16:08.540]  Design facility, design teams to design the signs
[16:08.540 --> 16:10.700]  and our booths and things like that for the Cannabis Cup.
[16:10.700 --> 16:12.720]  We need those types of things.
[16:12.720 --> 16:15.460]  Testing facilities, if there's not a testing facility
[16:15.460 --> 16:17.500]  in your area, if Steep Hill Labs,
[16:17.500 --> 16:20.480]  if Steep Hill Haylent hasn't already moved in in your area,
[16:20.480 --> 16:21.900]  then open a testing facility
[16:21.900 --> 16:23.060]  or even if they're already there,
[16:23.060 --> 16:24.940]  open another testing facility.
[16:24.940 --> 16:27.040]  I like that I'm on Periscope and people are throwing up
[16:27.040 --> 16:28.800]  the ideas that I've got on my list here.
[16:28.800 --> 16:31.180]  That's a good one, bro, I see it and I've got it on my list.
[16:31.180 --> 16:32.020]  Where was I?
[16:32.020 --> 16:33.860]  Testing facilities, other ancillary businesses
[16:33.860 --> 16:35.900]  like head shops and grow stores, you guys,
[16:35.900 --> 16:37.600]  like Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[16:37.600 --> 16:42.600]  Those guys are aiming at the outdoor and indoor farmer
[16:43.660 --> 16:44.900]  that is producing tomatoes,
[16:44.900 --> 16:47.100]  but this cannabis business is also boosting
[16:47.100 --> 16:48.700]  their sales ridiculously.
[16:48.700 --> 16:51.100]  So a grow store, a head shop,
[16:51.100 --> 16:53.400]  most of the dispensaries have smoking gear,
[16:53.400 --> 16:55.500]  they have dab rigs, they have bongs,
[16:55.500 --> 16:56.820]  they have pipes, they have papers,
[16:56.820 --> 16:59.580]  but it's grossly overpriced in that son of a bitch.
[16:59.580 --> 17:01.860]  If you opened up a head shop down the street
[17:01.860 --> 17:05.020]  from a dispensary and sold things at a decent markup,
[17:05.020 --> 17:07.460]  you would make money because people will know
[17:07.460 --> 17:10.580]  that this dispensary charges me good price for weed,
[17:10.580 --> 17:12.400]  ridiculous prices for glass,
[17:12.400 --> 17:13.460]  I'm gonna go to the glass shop
[17:13.460 --> 17:16.420]  and buy my smoking accessories there.
[17:16.420 --> 17:19.460]  Somebody just wrote on Periscope, they said security.
[17:19.460 --> 17:21.620]  Security guards are always needed at the dispensaries.
[17:21.620 --> 17:23.340]  We need security guards for our grows,
[17:23.340 --> 17:26.400]  for the dispensaries, for all of our businesses.
[17:27.500 --> 17:29.820]  Packaging, if you know how to make packaging,
[17:29.820 --> 17:33.100]  if you can design packaging, if you are a packaging person,
[17:33.100 --> 17:35.820]  that sort of stuff is needed in our industry.
[17:35.820 --> 17:38.020]  Something that people overlook is clothing.
[17:38.020 --> 17:39.940]  People, cannabis clothing,
[17:39.940 --> 17:42.720]  locally aimed cannabis clothing sells.
[17:42.720 --> 17:44.440]  If you've got your state,
[17:44.440 --> 17:46.600]  if you can make your state flag into something,
[17:46.600 --> 17:48.160]  Colorado, or kind of cannabis-y,
[17:48.160 --> 17:50.560]  then that will sell in your area.
[17:50.560 --> 17:52.500]  Web design, all of the dispensaries
[17:52.500 --> 17:54.280]  need some sort of web design.
[17:54.280 --> 17:56.240]  Something that Colorado specializes in,
[17:56.240 --> 17:58.880]  we have something called a compliance specialist.
[17:58.880 --> 18:01.040]  If you run a dispensary or work in a dispensary
[18:01.040 --> 18:03.520]  or own a dispensary, everything has to be done
[18:03.520 --> 18:06.360]  under a certain set of rules that are set by the MED.
[18:06.360 --> 18:09.800]  You need one or two people that know all of those rules,
[18:09.800 --> 18:10.920]  and if you ask them a question,
[18:10.920 --> 18:12.680]  it's their job to go in the office
[18:13.520 --> 18:14.600]  and get the book and figure out that rule.
[18:14.600 --> 18:16.560]  That's your compliance specialist.
[18:16.560 --> 18:18.520]  And he needs to be finding out all of the new rules
[18:18.520 --> 18:19.560]  as they come out.
[18:19.560 --> 18:22.560]  He needs to be walking through the grow,
[18:22.560 --> 18:24.800]  through the sales area, through all of the dispensary
[18:24.800 --> 18:27.080]  and making sure that everything is under compliance
[18:27.080 --> 18:28.960]  so that if the inspectors come in,
[18:28.960 --> 18:31.280]  you are cool and legit and he keeps you out of trouble.
[18:31.280 --> 18:35.300]  So the dispensaries need assistance from everywhere.
[18:35.300 --> 18:38.820]  Also, a taxi service of some sort would be really cool.
[18:38.820 --> 18:40.760]  Or if you can open, this is the obvious one,
[18:40.760 --> 18:42.560]  if you can open a smoking club,
[18:43.440 --> 18:44.280]  that would be cool as shit,
[18:44.280 --> 18:45.280]  but the rules are always gonna be strict
[18:45.280 --> 18:46.800]  for that sort of stuff.
[18:46.800 --> 18:49.920]  What I have seen is a lot of smoking buses.
[18:49.920 --> 18:51.320]  They have the cannabis tour bus
[18:51.320 --> 18:52.560]  because it's a little bit different.
[18:52.560 --> 18:53.580]  I don't know the rules on it.
[18:53.580 --> 18:55.800]  You'd have to find out that in your area.
[18:55.800 --> 18:58.240]  But a taxi service of some sort would be really cool.
[18:58.240 --> 19:02.040]  Transportation for intoxicated people makes you look good
[19:02.040 --> 19:03.800]  and it's a good business.
[19:03.800 --> 19:04.800]  What else do we have?
[19:04.800 --> 19:06.240]  Oh, there's a service around here
[19:06.240 --> 19:09.240]  that actually hires specifically for dispensaries.
[19:09.240 --> 19:11.520]  It's a temp agency and you go and apply
[19:11.520 --> 19:12.720]  and you have to get your med badge.
[19:12.720 --> 19:14.000]  And once you've got your med badge,
[19:14.000 --> 19:16.440]  they send you to a dispensary and you work there
[19:16.440 --> 19:18.400]  and it could lead to permanent employment,
[19:18.400 --> 19:21.240]  just like a normal job at a normal temp agency.
[19:21.240 --> 19:24.760]  And they're designed specifically for the cannabis industry.
[19:24.760 --> 19:27.280]  So you could open your own temp agency
[19:27.280 --> 19:29.560]  to hire people for the dispensaries
[19:29.560 --> 19:31.240]  so that dispensary owners and managers
[19:31.240 --> 19:33.760]  don't have to spend their day interviewing people.
[19:33.760 --> 19:35.720]  They pay you to do that.
[19:35.720 --> 19:38.720]  You send these people to the dispensary, they work,
[19:38.720 --> 19:40.560]  they get paid a certain amount of money
[19:40.560 --> 19:42.520]  and then you take a dollar, whatever,
[19:42.520 --> 19:44.320]  you make sure that they get paid minimum wage,
[19:44.320 --> 19:46.360]  but then you take a dollar or a portion of whatever
[19:46.360 --> 19:48.520]  they get paid to make your business work.
[19:48.520 --> 19:50.680]  So that happens around here.
[19:50.680 --> 19:54.120]  Like I said, there'll be a need for lodging, hotels.
[19:54.120 --> 19:56.760]  Hotels will be serious when cannabis goes recreational
[19:56.760 --> 19:59.240]  in your area because people will be coming from afar
[19:59.240 --> 20:01.160]  to the nearest dispensaries to get cannabis.
[20:01.160 --> 20:03.240]  Like we get people, we're in Colorado,
[20:03.240 --> 20:06.360]  we get people from Texas, Wyoming, Oklahoma,
[20:06.360 --> 20:09.120]  they come from all over to get weed from us here
[20:09.120 --> 20:10.220]  and they're filling up the hotels.
[20:10.880 --> 20:13.180]  They'll come take weekend trips just to buy weed all over
[20:13.180 --> 20:15.820]  and they'll have to stay in a hotel somewhere.
[20:15.820 --> 20:16.700]  Let's see.
[20:16.700 --> 20:18.460]  So that's a lot of things that you guys could,
[20:18.460 --> 20:19.860]  those are business opportunities
[20:19.860 --> 20:21.520]  that you could take advantage of.
[20:21.520 --> 20:24.380]  If you could open somewhere to actually consume cannabis
[20:24.380 --> 20:26.780]  in your area, that would be ideal because here
[20:26.780 --> 20:28.900]  you can buy weed at 13 different places
[20:28.900 --> 20:30.140]  within 10 miles of each other,
[20:30.140 --> 20:32.780]  but there's nowhere to legally consume your cannabis.
[20:34.460 --> 20:37.420]  All right, so that's a big ass list of ancillary
[20:37.420 --> 20:40.480]  and niche businesses that you could participate in
[20:40.480 --> 20:42.060]  without opening up your own cannabis,
[20:42.060 --> 20:45.060]  but you could still capitalize on this cannabis industry.
[20:45.060 --> 20:47.460]  Also, there's those little hippie stores
[20:47.460 --> 20:49.740]  that sell like hippie clothing, like patchwork pants
[20:49.740 --> 20:52.460]  and tie-dyed t-shirts and fucking hemp jewelry
[20:52.460 --> 20:53.780]  and all that kind of shit.
[20:53.780 --> 20:55.820]  I think if you open one of those near a dispensary
[20:55.820 --> 20:58.020]  and you capitalize on that cannabis theme,
[20:58.020 --> 21:01.260]  and like I said earlier, if you use your state or your city
[21:01.260 --> 21:04.700]  and weed out your slogan, like my logo for iRegenetics
[21:04.700 --> 21:08.060]  is the Colorado flag that's turned into the Rasta colors.
[21:08.060 --> 21:09.860]  And people don't even know about the company
[21:09.860 --> 21:10.780]  when they see it and they're like,
[21:10.780 --> 21:13.020]  holy shit, I love that shirt.
[21:13.020 --> 21:16.460]  So that would be a good way to take your state flag
[21:16.460 --> 21:19.460]  or your city logo or whatever and turn it into some sort
[21:19.460 --> 21:22.220]  of cannabis themed flag and make a spoof of it
[21:22.220 --> 21:24.660]  and sell that in your store in your area.
[21:24.660 --> 21:26.820]  That would sell, that would crush.
[21:26.820 --> 21:29.100]  But all right, I've gone on a long time about this subject.
[21:29.100 --> 21:30.180]  I'm gonna take a drink of root beer
[21:30.180 --> 21:33.260]  and then we're going to, actually check it out.
[21:33.260 --> 21:34.860]  We have been on Periscope the entire time
[21:34.860 --> 21:36.780]  I've been recording and I told those people on Periscope
[21:36.780 --> 21:38.180]  that we would take questions.
[21:38.180 --> 21:41.100]  I see that we have 17 people on Periscope right now.
[21:41.100 --> 21:43.540]  We've got, I'd like to go about nine or eight more minutes
[21:43.540 --> 21:44.380]  in this podcast.
[21:44.380 --> 21:46.900]  So if Periscope has got any questions for me,
[21:46.900 --> 21:49.180]  please type in your questions while I take a drink
[21:49.180 --> 21:52.020]  and I will read my favorite questions
[21:52.020 --> 21:54.380]  and then I'll try to answer them the best that I can for you.
[21:54.380 --> 21:56.060]  So while I take a drink, you guys start typing
[21:56.060 --> 21:58.100]  your questions there on Periscope for me.
[22:07.360 --> 22:08.960]  All right, that's funny because usually Periscope
[22:08.960 --> 22:10.520]  is filled with questions and now they seem like
[22:11.240 --> 22:12.080]  they're stumped.
[22:12.080 --> 22:13.240]  Earlier on Periscope, somebody asked me,
[22:13.240 --> 22:16.760]  what is the difference between wax and shatter?
[22:16.760 --> 22:20.020]  So basically I am not the hash maker here.
[22:20.020 --> 22:22.160]  This is my experience from watching and hearing
[22:22.160 --> 22:23.960]  my hash maker friends talk.
[22:23.960 --> 22:26.920]  The difference between wax and shatter.
[22:26.920 --> 22:30.960]  Most BHO, okay, somebody asked me a question there
[22:30.960 --> 22:32.480]  and I'm gonna write it.
[22:32.480 --> 22:33.320]  I'm writing it down.
[22:33.320 --> 22:34.680]  How do you feel about smoking and driving?
[22:34.680 --> 22:38.160]  We're gonna ask that, we're gonna answer that in a second.
[22:38.160 --> 22:40.840]  I'm writing it down, smoke and drive.
[22:40.840 --> 22:43.880]  All right, but I was answering the first question.
[22:43.880 --> 22:45.860]  What's the difference between wax and shatter?
[22:45.860 --> 22:48.240]  Basically when you make BHO, if it's done right,
[22:48.240 --> 22:50.800]  they'll both come out very near,
[22:50.800 --> 22:53.120]  when it's done right, it'll come out very near shatter.
[22:53.120 --> 22:56.920]  The consistency will be very near shatter if not sappy.
[22:56.920 --> 22:59.640]  So at this point, if you vacuum purge it properly
[22:59.640 --> 23:03.240]  and don't mess with it too much, it will stay shatter.
[23:03.240 --> 23:05.740]  It will come out, shatter is more like,
[23:05.740 --> 23:06.960]  sorry, I'm burping after my drink.
[23:06.960 --> 23:08.880]  Shatter is like a Jolly Rancher consistency
[23:08.880 --> 23:11.040]  where it's kind of snappy, it'll break.
[23:11.040 --> 23:12.040]  That's why we call it shatter.
[23:12.040 --> 23:13.160]  It's like a little piece of glass.
[23:13.160 --> 23:16.440]  If you chip at it too hard, it'll shatter.
[23:16.440 --> 23:20.960]  So most hash, most BHO ran properly will turn into shatter.
[23:20.960 --> 23:22.720]  Now the way that you make it into wax
[23:22.720 --> 23:25.800]  is right before it cools,
[23:27.860 --> 23:29.240]  how tight's the open container law?
[23:29.240 --> 23:30.080]  I don't know.
[23:30.080 --> 23:31.400]  Somebody asked me a question on Periscope
[23:31.400 --> 23:33.480]  that said how tight's the open container laws?
[23:33.480 --> 23:34.760]  I'm not experienced with that.
[23:34.760 --> 23:36.180]  In my area, they don't give a shit,
[23:36.220 --> 23:37.820]  but in some areas they really do.
[23:37.820 --> 23:39.420]  So let me continue with my hash,
[23:39.420 --> 23:41.120]  or my shatter versus wax part.
[23:41.120 --> 23:42.340]  So now we've got this shatter, right?
[23:42.340 --> 23:43.620]  It's hard, it's stable.
[23:43.620 --> 23:47.620]  Now you could turn that into wax by heating it
[23:47.620 --> 23:50.780]  or before you even let it warm, just keep it warm.
[23:50.780 --> 23:52.340]  Before you let it cool, keep it warm.
[23:52.340 --> 23:53.980]  And what you do is whip it.
[23:53.980 --> 23:55.360]  And I don't know what they use to whip it.
[23:55.360 --> 23:57.580]  I've seen a few things like,
[23:57.580 --> 24:01.260]  I saw one guy use a metal pick like for your Afro
[24:01.260 --> 24:04.460]  because it had four or five little fingers coming off of it.
[24:04.460 --> 24:06.160]  I guess their teeth, if they're on the pick,
[24:06.160 --> 24:08.980]  but he would put that in the Pyrex dish of hash
[24:08.980 --> 24:11.800]  and just stir it around really rapidly.
[24:11.800 --> 24:13.660]  And what he was trying to do is whip it
[24:13.660 --> 24:16.220]  like he was stirring some kind of food
[24:16.220 --> 24:18.980]  and trying to put air into it and make it fluffy.
[24:18.980 --> 24:20.700]  And so what that does is it fluffs it up.
[24:20.700 --> 24:23.340]  And then when it dries, there's air trapped in there
[24:23.340 --> 24:25.320]  and it just dries up a little bit differently.
[24:25.320 --> 24:28.260]  I don't know the science behind why, but it makes it waxy
[24:28.260 --> 24:30.220]  and it's a little bit easier to handle.
[24:31.620 --> 24:33.100]  Then they put that in the vac oven,
[24:33.100 --> 24:36.400]  just like they do the shatter and they clean it up.
[24:36.400 --> 24:38.220]  So I know that's not the most technical answer,
[24:38.220 --> 24:40.460]  but the main difference between wax and shatter
[24:40.460 --> 24:42.540]  is the whipping action that happens
[24:42.540 --> 24:44.220]  right before it's finished.
[24:44.220 --> 24:46.060]  You just whip it up and put a little bit of air in it
[24:46.060 --> 24:47.860]  and it makes a little bit fluffy.
[24:49.060 --> 24:50.220]  Somebody on Periscope says,
[24:50.220 --> 24:52.400]  keep the vac at 120 and it will bubble.
[24:53.460 --> 24:55.100]  Yeah, but 120 is a little high.
[24:55.100 --> 24:56.580]  That's when you start burning off turps
[24:56.580 --> 24:58.980]  is about 106, 110 ish.
[24:58.980 --> 25:00.120]  All right, so somebody asked me
[25:00.120 --> 25:02.360]  how I feel about smoking and driving.
[25:02.360 --> 25:04.240]  It's a really good question.
[25:04.240 --> 25:08.720]  I cannot advocate you smoking cannabis and driving.
[25:08.720 --> 25:11.320]  I can't say to do that, but again, I can't be a hypocrite
[25:11.320 --> 25:14.120]  because I do it myself occasionally.
[25:14.120 --> 25:17.240]  How I feel about it is, if you know your limits
[25:17.240 --> 25:20.480]  and you're not gonna be a dipshit out there on the road
[25:20.480 --> 25:22.280]  and you're not fucked up,
[25:22.280 --> 25:24.440]  drive if you've had a little bit to smoke.
[25:24.440 --> 25:26.520]  But if you're the kind of person that smokes
[25:26.520 --> 25:28.240]  and goes fucking full retarded,
[25:28.240 --> 25:31.240]  don't get behind the wheel, know your limitations.
[25:31.240 --> 25:33.680]  Check yourself before you hurt somebody or yourself.
[25:33.680 --> 25:35.800]  That's how I really feel about it.
[25:35.800 --> 25:37.480]  I would be a hypocrite if I came on here
[25:37.480 --> 25:40.020]  and I said, don't take dabs and drive.
[25:40.020 --> 25:42.880]  Maybe you don't take dabs and drive simultaneously.
[25:42.880 --> 25:44.840]  Try not to smoke in the car.
[25:44.840 --> 25:46.360]  Just don't be that asshole.
[25:46.360 --> 25:49.200]  Think about the news article about you
[25:49.200 --> 25:50.440]  when you fuck up in the future.
[25:50.440 --> 25:51.760]  Check out what you're doing and say,
[25:51.760 --> 25:54.280]  huh, I'm about to be a news story.
[25:54.280 --> 25:55.520]  You know what I mean?
[25:55.520 --> 25:56.960]  If I crash into somebody right now
[25:56.960 --> 25:59.020]  while I'm smoking this bong in the car,
[25:59.020 --> 26:00.480]  I'm going to be on the news.
[26:00.480 --> 26:01.600]  I'm going to look like an asshole.
[26:01.600 --> 26:03.920]  I'm going to be a black eye for the cannabis community.
[26:03.920 --> 26:07.160]  Or I don't want to get pulled over while I'm taking this dab.
[26:07.160 --> 26:08.320]  Think about that kind of shit.
[26:08.320 --> 26:10.520]  But if you want to get blazed before you drive
[26:10.520 --> 26:12.440]  and you can handle it and you're not an idiot,
[26:12.440 --> 26:14.480]  that's your thing, do that.
[26:14.480 --> 26:16.200]  Don't drink a drop of alcohol and drive
[26:16.200 --> 26:17.520]  because I'm a hypocrite maybe,
[26:17.520 --> 26:20.080]  but I feel alcohol really fucks with your equilibrium,
[26:20.080 --> 26:22.000]  your balance, your depth and perception.
[26:22.000 --> 26:23.480]  It really fucks you up.
[26:23.480 --> 26:25.680]  But if you're a medical marijuana consumer,
[26:25.680 --> 26:28.120]  you're probably, you've got a tolerance,
[26:28.120 --> 26:30.240]  you're experienced and you're not smoking it
[26:31.000 --> 26:31.840]  just to get retarded high.
[26:31.840 --> 26:34.840]  If you're smoking just to get retarded high, don't drive.
[26:34.840 --> 26:37.000]  Chill out for a little bit, let somebody drive for you.
[26:37.000 --> 26:39.100]  Call an Uber, do whatever you got to do.
[26:39.100 --> 26:40.840]  That's my opinion on that.
[26:40.840 --> 26:42.600]  All right, Periscope, you have one more question for me?
[26:42.600 --> 26:45.440]  It'd be perfect to get one more question in.
[26:45.440 --> 26:47.240]  And on Periscope, they're sending me a bunch of hearts,
[26:47.240 --> 26:48.840]  which means they got love for me.
[26:48.840 --> 26:50.000]  It's technically illegal.
[26:50.000 --> 26:51.560]  Is it technically illegal to drive high?
[26:51.560 --> 26:54.400]  Yes, it is technically illegal to drive high.
[26:54.400 --> 26:56.240]  That's driving under the influence of drugs
[26:56.240 --> 26:57.720]  or driving with ability impaired,
[26:57.720 --> 26:59.240]  depending on how they book you
[26:59.240 --> 27:00.560]  or how they write it down or whatever.
[27:00.560 --> 27:02.200]  I don't know what the difference would be,
[27:02.200 --> 27:05.340]  but it is absolutely illegal to drive while you're high.
[27:05.340 --> 27:07.460]  And it's definitely looked down upon.
[27:10.260 --> 27:12.680]  DUI, somebody on Periscope says,
[27:12.680 --> 27:14.480]  DUI, it's driving under the influence.
[27:14.480 --> 27:17.200]  So yeah, don't be high when you're driving.
[27:17.200 --> 27:19.200]  And if the cops ask you how long ago you smoked,
[27:19.200 --> 27:20.600]  say six hours ago, be like,
[27:20.600 --> 27:22.720]  it's been at least six hours ago.
[27:22.720 --> 27:24.760]  Unless you, but if you're smoking a joint in the car,
[27:24.760 --> 27:27.000]  if you got a blunt burn and that's no excuse.
[27:28.000 --> 27:29.520]  All right, I'm waiting for Periscope
[27:29.520 --> 27:30.520]  to throw up one more question.
[27:30.520 --> 27:31.760]  If they don't throw up one more question,
[27:31.760 --> 27:33.440]  we will start closing up the show.
[27:35.120 --> 27:36.880]  What's my favorite part of my job?
[27:36.880 --> 27:38.560]  Oh, open container.
[27:38.560 --> 27:40.520]  So favorite part of my job in open container.
[27:40.520 --> 27:42.300]  I'm going to write down the open container.
[27:42.300 --> 27:43.760]  That's funny because I wrote down open content.
[27:43.760 --> 27:44.920]  That looks terrible.
[27:44.920 --> 27:46.640]  I want to be in the cannabis industry.
[27:46.640 --> 27:48.680]  How do I get involved in the biz?
[27:48.680 --> 27:49.880]  I'm going to write that down.
[27:49.880 --> 27:51.280]  Cause that's, and now guys,
[27:51.280 --> 27:52.120]  slow down with the questions
[27:52.120 --> 27:54.640]  because I've got fucking one that I wrote down
[27:54.640 --> 27:55.480]  and one that I forgot.
[27:55.480 --> 27:58.480]  Remind me the one, favorite part, fav part.
[27:58.480 --> 27:59.760]  I'm writing all this shit down guys.
[27:59.760 --> 28:00.600]  Cause I got to go fast.
[28:00.600 --> 28:05.280]  How do I work in MJ?
[28:05.280 --> 28:06.680]  All right, I got three questions.
[28:06.680 --> 28:07.520]  I'm going to answer these.
[28:07.520 --> 28:09.120]  So if you throw up more questions, I'm sorry.
[28:09.120 --> 28:10.200]  I probably won't get to them
[28:10.200 --> 28:11.960]  unless it's a really good question.
[28:11.960 --> 28:12.800]  So here we go.
[28:12.800 --> 28:15.040]  What's my favorite part of my job?
[28:15.040 --> 28:19.560]  My job is to provide the best quality cannabis
[28:19.560 --> 28:22.760]  that I can for the customers at the spot dispensary.
[28:22.760 --> 28:25.560]  My other job is to provide the best quality cannabis
[28:25.560 --> 28:28.200]  that I can for the medical marijuana patients,
[28:28.200 --> 28:31.320]  which have designated me as their caregiver.
[28:31.320 --> 28:34.640]  The other part of my job is to host a podcast
[28:34.640 --> 28:38.600]  that teaches other people how to grow better cannabis
[28:38.600 --> 28:40.920]  to improve the quality of their own lives.
[28:41.960 --> 28:43.360]  Another big part of my job
[28:43.360 --> 28:45.240]  that people don't realize is I'm a father.
[28:45.240 --> 28:46.640]  So I am shaping somebody.
[28:46.640 --> 28:49.600]  I'm creating another person into what I hope
[28:49.600 --> 28:52.680]  to be a successful and happy human being.
[28:53.560 --> 28:57.040]  So the favorite part of my job is helping other people out
[28:57.040 --> 29:00.880]  and seeing the positive effect that the work I do
[29:00.880 --> 29:02.840]  has on other people's lives.
[29:02.840 --> 29:07.840]  Because honestly, I grow weed and I'm a dad
[29:08.080 --> 29:11.360]  and play on Instagram and I play on Periscope
[29:11.360 --> 29:12.360]  and it feels like I'm just playing.
[29:12.360 --> 29:15.120]  I'm a big man child because my job is what I love.
[29:15.120 --> 29:16.920]  So it doesn't feel like I'm working.
[29:16.920 --> 29:18.960]  And that right there may be my favorite part of it.
[29:18.960 --> 29:21.000]  It doesn't feel like I'm working ever.
[29:21.080 --> 29:22.680]  I'll be completely sweaty.
[29:25.600 --> 29:26.440]  That's a good question,
[29:26.440 --> 29:28.560]  but I'm probably not gonna get to that one.
[29:28.560 --> 29:32.680]  Text that to me on Twitter and I'll answer that.
[29:32.680 --> 29:34.800]  And yes, I do play the drums.
[29:34.800 --> 29:35.840]  So I do a lot of things.
[29:35.840 --> 29:38.280]  And I think my favorite part of my job is seeing people happy
[29:38.280 --> 29:39.920]  like I've got a patient named Doug.
[29:39.920 --> 29:41.720]  He's a 60 year old guy
[29:41.720 --> 29:43.080]  and he feels like shit half the time.
[29:43.080 --> 29:45.360]  And I grow cannabis that I know he loves.
[29:45.360 --> 29:47.520]  And I go to his house and I roll up a big fat joint
[29:47.520 --> 29:48.520]  or I give him a dab and I'm like,
[29:48.520 --> 29:50.680]  hey, Doug, let's hang out and smoke this.
[29:51.360 --> 29:53.560]  And when I get there, he's hurt or sick and depressed
[29:53.560 --> 29:55.040]  and he's got a shitty look on his face.
[29:55.040 --> 29:55.880]  And by the time I leave,
[29:55.880 --> 29:58.400]  the dude's got a smile on his face and he loves the world
[29:58.400 --> 30:00.280]  and he loves life again.
[30:00.280 --> 30:02.400]  And part of that is my interaction with the guy,
[30:02.400 --> 30:05.120]  but a large portion of that is the cannabis plant.
[30:05.120 --> 30:06.800]  And a large portion of that is the cannabis
[30:06.800 --> 30:08.780]  that I grew from my heart
[30:08.780 --> 30:10.320]  and gave to this old guy to feel better.
[30:10.320 --> 30:13.040]  So that's probably the favorite part of my job
[30:13.040 --> 30:14.640]  is that I'm healing people.
[30:14.640 --> 30:17.120]  Even the people that are smoking cannabis recreationally,
[30:17.120 --> 30:17.960]  it's healing.
[30:17.960 --> 30:21.120]  It feels better to take a fat puff of ganja
[30:21.120 --> 30:23.480]  and blow out that smoke and just feel better.
[30:23.480 --> 30:25.960]  So I get to do that to people every day.
[30:25.960 --> 30:26.800]  I get to see that.
[30:26.800 --> 30:27.840]  It is all in the love.
[30:27.840 --> 30:28.980]  That's absolutely correct.
[30:28.980 --> 30:31.200]  So somebody asked me what's my favorite part.
[30:31.200 --> 30:32.040]  I think that is it.
[30:32.040 --> 30:35.220]  I get to see people improve their lives from my work.
[30:35.220 --> 30:37.480]  And that makes me feel fucking golden inside.
[30:38.720 --> 30:40.480]  Somebody asked me about an open container law.
[30:40.480 --> 30:44.120]  Here in Colorado, we've started treating cannabis
[30:44.120 --> 30:46.880]  like alcohol is our new model here.
[30:46.880 --> 30:48.680]  So we've got what's called the open container law.
[30:48.680 --> 30:50.740]  Unfortunately, I am not up to date
[30:50.740 --> 30:52.420]  on the open container law.
[30:52.420 --> 30:53.840]  I don't know enough about it.
[30:53.840 --> 30:55.720]  In my city, you can drive around
[30:55.720 --> 30:57.240]  with your dab rig on the dash.
[30:57.240 --> 30:58.920]  My city is a little bit gangster
[30:58.920 --> 31:00.360]  and nobody cares what you're doing here
[31:00.360 --> 31:01.680]  as long as you're not shooting at each other
[31:01.680 --> 31:03.160]  when you drive by.
[31:03.160 --> 31:05.560]  In other places, you've got to have your stuff
[31:05.560 --> 31:08.200]  in a childproof container or a sealed container
[31:08.200 --> 31:09.040]  in your vehicle.
[31:09.040 --> 31:10.340]  And it's gotta be out of your reach
[31:10.340 --> 31:12.340]  and in the trunk, I think.
[31:12.340 --> 31:14.000]  But my vehicle doesn't have a trunk.
[31:14.000 --> 31:16.080]  So I put it in my backpack
[31:16.320 --> 31:17.960]  and then I put it in the back seat.
[31:17.960 --> 31:19.920]  But quite often, honestly,
[31:19.920 --> 31:22.280]  there's a dab rig in my center console.
[31:22.280 --> 31:24.560]  But if I'm driving from here to Revae's house,
[31:24.560 --> 31:25.600]  what am I gonna do?
[31:25.600 --> 31:27.160]  I just put the dab rig in the center console,
[31:27.160 --> 31:29.440]  I put my hash, my carb cap, my torch in there,
[31:29.440 --> 31:30.400]  and I drive over to Revae's
[31:30.400 --> 31:31.240]  and I carry it into the house
[31:31.240 --> 31:32.720]  and I take a couple dabs.
[31:32.720 --> 31:34.680]  So honestly, I don't know enough
[31:34.680 --> 31:37.640]  about that open container law to be useful.
[31:37.640 --> 31:38.480]  And I'm not a lawyer,
[31:38.480 --> 31:41.680]  so don't follow my advice on that shit at all.
[31:42.540 --> 31:45.960]  Somebody asked, how do I get to work
[31:46.800 --> 31:48.240]  in the marijuana industry?
[31:48.240 --> 31:50.440]  You have to start by applying for your,
[31:50.440 --> 31:51.480]  if you're coming to Colorado,
[31:51.480 --> 31:53.040]  you have to start by applying
[31:53.040 --> 31:55.860]  for your marijuana enforcement division badge.
[31:55.860 --> 31:56.960]  You have to go to the website.
[31:56.960 --> 31:58.200]  I'm not sure which website it is.
[31:58.200 --> 31:59.200]  I didn't have time to research,
[31:59.200 --> 32:00.880]  but if you search it,
[32:00.880 --> 32:04.400]  how do I find my marijuana enforcement badge for Colorado?
[32:04.400 --> 32:05.500]  You'll find the website.
[32:05.500 --> 32:07.480]  There will be a list of instructions.
[32:07.480 --> 32:09.680]  Fill out the application.
[32:09.680 --> 32:11.000]  You'll have to come to Colorado.
[32:11.000 --> 32:12.520]  You'll have to be fingerprinted.
[32:12.520 --> 32:13.360]  And then they'll let you know
[32:13.360 --> 32:15.920]  if you pass that background check or not.
[32:16.760 --> 32:18.520]  There are two levels of badges.
[32:18.520 --> 32:22.220]  One is $150 and one is $300.
[32:22.220 --> 32:23.600]  And you have to take a check.
[32:23.600 --> 32:25.400]  They do not accept cash.
[32:25.400 --> 32:27.160]  So you have to make an appointment,
[32:27.160 --> 32:28.120]  download the application,
[32:28.120 --> 32:29.240]  fill out the application,
[32:29.240 --> 32:31.280]  make an appointment to go,
[32:31.280 --> 32:33.060]  get a check, or no, it's a money order.
[32:33.060 --> 32:34.280]  Get a check or a money order.
[32:34.280 --> 32:35.320]  I think it's a money order.
[32:35.320 --> 32:36.200]  You need a money order.
[32:36.200 --> 32:37.720]  So get yourself a money order,
[32:37.720 --> 32:38.920]  go to the appointment.
[32:40.680 --> 32:42.000]  That's a lot of questions.
[32:42.000 --> 32:42.840]  Somebody just asked me
[32:42.840 --> 32:44.140]  what's allowed to be on your background.
[32:44.140 --> 32:45.980]  Basically no drug felonies.
[32:45.980 --> 32:50.180]  If you have got college loans and shit,
[32:50.180 --> 32:51.020]  you gotta start,
[32:51.020 --> 32:51.860]  you have to be in good standing
[32:51.860 --> 32:53.140]  with all of your college loans.
[32:53.140 --> 32:55.660]  Your child support has to be up to date.
[32:55.660 --> 32:56.820]  You have to be pretty legit.
[32:56.820 --> 32:58.180]  If you're fucking around,
[32:58.180 --> 33:00.420]  they're gonna wanna know why you're fucking around.
[33:00.420 --> 33:02.140]  They're gonna ask you questions.
[33:02.140 --> 33:05.060]  So get the application filled out,
[33:05.060 --> 33:06.900]  get yourself a badge.
[33:06.900 --> 33:10.020]  Then the thing to do is hit every dispensary you can
[33:10.020 --> 33:12.740]  with a resume and explain to them
[33:12.740 --> 33:14.540]  why you're the employee that they want.
[33:14.540 --> 33:15.620]  And if you're not experienced
[33:15.620 --> 33:17.580]  in the cannabis industry here in Colorado,
[33:17.580 --> 33:20.620]  it's going to be difficult getting your foot in the door
[33:20.620 --> 33:23.460]  because the dispensaries are full.
[33:23.460 --> 33:26.140]  People have been employed there for quite a while.
[33:26.140 --> 33:29.320]  I don't know if you can get into the cannabis industry
[33:29.320 --> 33:30.540]  with marijuana misdemeanors.
[33:30.540 --> 33:33.580]  I really do not know the, I don't know.
[33:33.580 --> 33:34.500]  Sorry, I apologize.
[33:34.500 --> 33:35.740]  I don't have that right on hand.
[33:35.740 --> 33:36.820]  If I would have prepared that question,
[33:36.820 --> 33:37.660]  I would have researched it for you.
[33:37.660 --> 33:39.860]  But since we're doing it right off the cuff here,
[33:39.860 --> 33:41.140]  I'm not sure.
[33:41.140 --> 33:42.340]  But so you get your badge
[33:42.940 --> 33:44.020]  and then you come here and then you apply
[33:44.020 --> 33:45.740]  and then hopefully you get somebody's attention.
[33:45.740 --> 33:47.260]  And you're probably gonna have to start
[33:47.260 --> 33:50.020]  by being like a trimmer or a bud tender
[33:50.020 --> 33:51.540]  or something like that.
[33:51.540 --> 33:54.820]  So I would learn how to trim weed
[33:54.820 --> 33:56.300]  is probably where you're gonna start
[33:56.300 --> 33:58.820]  because unless you're a master grower and you can prove it,
[33:58.820 --> 34:01.220]  nobody's gonna let you start off being a master grower.
[34:01.220 --> 34:02.060]  It's not gonna happen.
[34:02.060 --> 34:03.740]  You're gonna be an hourly trimmer.
[34:03.740 --> 34:08.000]  So work on your resume, start learning how to trim weed,
[34:08.000 --> 34:10.540]  learn how to be chipper, grow some boobs.
[34:10.540 --> 34:13.140]  I hate to say it, but dispensaries will hire you
[34:13.140 --> 34:15.060]  if you have got some boobs.
[34:15.060 --> 34:17.660]  If you're a cute 22, 25 year old chick
[34:17.660 --> 34:18.940]  and you can flirt with the customers
[34:18.940 --> 34:20.100]  and you can sell some shit,
[34:20.100 --> 34:21.580]  there's a good chance you're gonna get a job
[34:21.580 --> 34:22.820]  in the cannabis industry.
[34:23.740 --> 34:26.420]  All right, so that's enough of my Periscope questions
[34:26.420 --> 34:27.420]  for today, you guys.
[34:27.420 --> 34:29.700]  Thank you so much on Periscope for asking questions
[34:29.700 --> 34:31.260]  and participating in the show.
[34:31.260 --> 34:33.080]  You guys that aren't on Periscope that are just listening
[34:33.080 --> 34:35.060]  on iTunes or Stitcher or the website,
[34:35.060 --> 34:36.140]  thank you for listening.
[34:36.140 --> 34:39.060]  If you wanna find me on Periscope, it's at rostageff420.
[34:39.060 --> 34:41.020]  I would appreciate you checking out my Periscope videos.
[34:41.020 --> 34:43.580]  I do about one Periscope, maybe two videos every day.
[34:43.580 --> 34:45.080]  I take some dabs and hang out.
[34:46.720 --> 34:49.060]  Somebody said, let me trim for you while you teach me.
[34:49.060 --> 34:50.500]  I'll show you on a video one day.
[34:50.500 --> 34:52.340]  We'll do some Periscope and trim on the video.
[34:52.340 --> 34:54.380]  I trim on Periscope quite often.
[34:54.380 --> 34:55.240]  But you guys that are listening,
[34:55.240 --> 34:56.100]  if you wanna check it out,
[34:56.100 --> 34:57.340]  it would be really fun to see you on there.
[34:57.340 --> 34:58.180]  You can ask questions.
[34:58.180 --> 35:00.580]  I will start scheduling podcasts.
[35:00.580 --> 35:02.380]  It's hard for me to schedule when I'm gonna record
[35:02.380 --> 35:03.460]  because I don't know when I'm gonna get home
[35:03.460 --> 35:05.040]  and how my life is gonna go.
[35:05.040 --> 35:07.020]  But if I just pick a time, it will happen.
[35:07.180 --> 35:09.180]  Somebody just said, thanks for all of my hard work.
[35:09.180 --> 35:10.020]  I appreciate that.
[35:10.020 --> 35:10.840]  Oh, it's El Diablo.
[35:10.840 --> 35:11.680]  Man, you're very welcome.
[35:11.680 --> 35:13.180]  Everyone's very welcome for all the hard work
[35:13.180 --> 35:14.300]  that I put in for the podcast.
[35:14.300 --> 35:16.220]  I appreciate getting feedback from it.
[35:16.220 --> 35:19.480]  I'm going to go ahead and wrap up the show.
[35:19.480 --> 35:21.340]  Looks like I've got a news article for next week,
[35:21.340 --> 35:22.380]  which is always cool.
[35:22.380 --> 35:25.560]  I'll probably be back on Thursday with another episode.

[38:42.480 --> 38:54.570]  Just don't somebody's son or them daughters.
[38:54.570 --> 38:57.090]  Why them people have some hypocritical laws?
[38:57.090 --> 39:14.740]  Equalizer.
[39:14.740 --> 39:17.380]  Some people smoke it for relaxation.
[39:17.380 --> 39:20.020]  Doctors prescribe it in a medication.
[39:20.020 --> 39:22.620]  Rasta man smoke it for good meditation.
[39:22.620 --> 39:25.220]  Rasta meditation, we get inspiration.
[39:25.220 --> 39:27.860]  Iris sensation, good vibration.

[39:46.380 --> 39:48.980]  De-criminalize it, de-criminalize it.
[39:48.980 --> 39:51.580]  De-criminalize it, de-criminalize it.
[39:51.580 --> 39:54.140]  De-criminalize it, de-criminalize it.
[39:54.140 --> 39:56.220]  De-criminalize it, de-criminalize it.
[39:56.220 --> 39:58.820]  Have you heard the word, legalizer?
[39:58.820 --> 40:01.420]  Have you heard the word, legalizer?
[40:01.420 --> 40:04.060]  Have you heard the word, legalizer?
[40:04.060 --> 40:06.540]  Have you heard the word, legalizer?
[40:06.540 --> 40:09.460]  De-criminalize the herb, make we burn it in peace.
[40:09.460 --> 40:12.020]  Arresting people for herb must cease.
[40:12.020 --> 40:14.940]  You're wasting the time of all the police.
[40:14.940 --> 40:17.260]  Too much time on the bud and the leaf.
[40:17.260 --> 40:19.820]  Look around the world how crime increase.
[40:19.860 --> 40:22.460]  Go on go catch murderers, go on go catch thieves.
[40:22.460 --> 40:24.940]  Go on go catch the robber, them and the sex piece.
[40:24.940 --> 40:27.540]  And leave ganja people in a peace, cease.
[40:27.540 --> 40:30.100]  Have you heard the word, legalizer?
[40:30.100 --> 40:32.700]  Have you heard the word, legalizer?

[40:35.340 --> 40:37.820]  Have you heard the word, legalizer?
[40:37.820 --> 40:39.820]  De-criminalize marijuana.
