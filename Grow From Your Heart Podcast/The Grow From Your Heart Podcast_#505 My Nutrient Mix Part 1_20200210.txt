[00:00.000 --> 00:04.800]  All right, here we go. Welcome back, podcast world. It is time for episode 505 of the Grow
[00:04.800 --> 00:09.440]  From Your Heart podcast. This episode of the show is brought to you by my friends at Seeds
[00:09.440 --> 00:14.240]  Here Now. If you need new regular, feminized, or auto flower seeds in your garden, I highly
[00:14.240 --> 00:23.320]  recommend Seeds Here Now, and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:23.320 --> 00:27.400]  You know, I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking. Today,
[00:27.400 --> 00:33.760]  I've been taking dabs of iScream Live Batter from Green Dot Labs. This is a blend of I-95
[00:33.760 --> 00:39.160]  and Screaming OG. On the package, the flavor is described as gas, mothballs, and fabric
[00:39.160 --> 00:43.360]  softener. We have talked about this concentrate before on the show. I completely agree with
[00:43.360 --> 00:48.880]  that flavor description. I completely love that flavor, and I absolutely love the buzz
[00:48.880 --> 00:54.040]  from the iScream Live Batter from Green Dot Labs. On the back of the package, it says
[00:54.040 --> 01:01.200]  the product does contain 65.04% THC. Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs
[01:01.200 --> 01:05.800]  for the delicious iScream Live Batter.
[01:05.800 --> 01:10.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes, smokers and growers,
[01:10.040 --> 01:16.040]  all you bad motherfuckers out there, this is one of the long-awaited mix episodes. So
[01:16.040 --> 01:20.880]  in this episode, I'm going to talk about my nutrient regimen and how I mix my nutrients.
[01:20.880 --> 01:24.760]  In this episode, we are going to start with the clone mix. We will work our way into the
[01:24.760 --> 01:30.800]  veg mix, and then the next episode will be the beginning of the flowering mix. Before
[01:30.800 --> 01:36.400]  we get to the mix part of this episode, let's do some shout outs to a few of our friends
[01:36.400 --> 01:38.440]  from Patreon.
[01:38.440 --> 01:41.560]  Let's start off with a big Giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to my friend

[03:12.380 --> 03:18.220]  world. Now it is time for you to bust out a notebook and a pen or pencil, or maybe bust
[03:18.220 --> 03:26.780]  open a note app on your phone because I am going to do a very detailed lesson on my very
[03:26.780 --> 03:32.940]  specific nutrient mix. There's a lot to this episode. I will try to be as clear as possible.
[03:32.940 --> 03:37.380]  I will try to give as many details as possible. I also want to make it easy for everybody
[03:37.380 --> 03:43.460]  to understand, so I'll try not to ramble too much, but you know me. So ladies and gentlemen,
[03:43.460 --> 03:49.420]  with no further ado, let's take a deep dive into my nutrient mix.
[03:49.420 --> 03:54.420]  Before we get into this, I want to say that nobody pays me to advertise their nutrients
[03:54.420 --> 04:01.340]  or products. I do not have any paid sponsors or advertisers on this episode. Everything
[04:01.340 --> 04:08.400]  I am talking about is because I really do use this in a commercial grow setting or in
[04:08.400 --> 04:14.700]  my personal grow setting. None of this is product placement. None of this is advertising.
[04:14.700 --> 04:20.380]  This is the Rasta Jeff grow style. This is what I do. So please don't think I'm doing
[04:20.380 --> 04:25.340]  this episode just to sell you some product, just to be a shill for some company. I'm going
[04:25.340 --> 04:30.400]  to mention a lot of specific products and a lot of very specific brands. None of those
[04:30.460 --> 04:35.480]  brands or companies or people paid me anything to do this episode.
[04:35.480 --> 04:40.720]  This is an episode to help my listeners because a lot of people are very curious about what
[04:40.720 --> 04:45.840]  I do in my grow, in my specific grow. They want to know my specific stuff. So here it
[04:45.840 --> 04:50.320]  is. I'm going to tell you what I do in my grow. I'm going to tell you a lot of things
[04:50.320 --> 04:54.920]  that I have learned through a lot of experimentation, through a lot of trial and error, through
[04:54.920 --> 05:00.440]  buying and trying a lot of different products, through reading a lot of forums. I've learned
[05:00.440 --> 05:06.140]  a lot by doing a lot of side-by-side comparisons. I've got the advantage of working in multiple
[05:06.140 --> 05:10.640]  commercial environments. That means I've got facilities all over Colorado where I can do
[05:10.640 --> 05:15.000]  experiments and as long as the plants come out happy and we reach our goals, I'm able
[05:15.000 --> 05:20.080]  to play with the nutrient mixes and the grow styles a little bit at each facility and see
[05:20.080 --> 05:22.280]  what works and what does not work.
[05:22.280 --> 05:26.440]  I have also been growing and experimenting with nutrient regimens in my own personal
[05:26.440 --> 05:31.040]  gardens for countless years. We won't even talk about how long because I may allegedly
[05:31.040 --> 05:35.440]  have started doing that before we had any type of legalization. So I've been mixing
[05:35.440 --> 05:39.960]  nutrients and experimenting with products for quite a while. This is what I have discovered
[05:39.960 --> 05:45.600]  works best for me in my personal grow as well as in a commercial environment. I have also
[05:45.600 --> 05:52.080]  found that these types of nutrient mixes are very replicable. I can write SOPs for these.
[05:52.080 --> 05:57.640]  I can do a podcast for these mixes and I can teach people how to do it on a very consistent
[05:57.640 --> 06:01.960]  basis which comes in very handy when I'm training people in a commercial environment.
[06:01.960 --> 06:05.240]  Let me get myself back on track because I did say I was going to try not to ramble a
[06:05.240 --> 06:10.240]  lot. My point here is that nobody is paying me to do this episode. Nobody has paid me
[06:10.240 --> 06:14.040]  in nutrients. Nobody has given me anything. This is what I'm doing and I want to share
[06:14.040 --> 06:20.080]  it with you. So let's talk about my nutrient mix. Again, this works for me. This may not
[06:20.080 --> 06:25.560]  be perfect for you, but I have learned that this mix and this grow style works very well
[06:25.560 --> 06:31.240]  for what I am trying to do in a commercial and in a home grow type environment. In a
[06:31.240 --> 06:36.600]  commercial environment, I like to use cocoa as my base. For my small plants, I will use
[06:36.600 --> 06:44.760]  70% to 80% cocoa and 20% to 30% perlite. I think that having 20% to 30% perlite in my
[06:44.760 --> 06:49.840]  cocoa makes a nice fluffy aerated mix. If we do overwater those pots, we don't have
[06:49.840 --> 06:54.520]  to worry about all of that cocoa compacting and crushing and suffocating my roots. So
[06:54.520 --> 07:02.640]  for the smaller plants, I do 70% cocoa and 30% perlite. For my larger plants in three
[07:02.640 --> 07:12.320]  gallon pots, I like to use 70% cocoa and 20% perlite and 10% persolite. Persolite is basically
[07:12.320 --> 07:16.560]  larger and chunkier perlite. When you're mixing the three gallon pots, when you're mixing
[07:16.560 --> 07:22.360]  large batches, it really helps fill it. It also adds a very nice aeration to the mix.
[07:22.360 --> 07:27.360]  That way, again, if somebody in the cultivation facility does overwater those plants, we don't
[07:27.360 --> 07:32.000]  suffocate those roots with that compacted cocoa. We've got plenty of perlite and plenty
[07:32.000 --> 07:39.720]  of persolite in the containers. So ideally, we would have 70% cocoa, 20% perlite, and
[07:39.720 --> 07:45.200]  10% persolite. If you do not have access to the persolite, if you don't want to add the
[07:45.200 --> 07:51.400]  persolite to your mix, just do 25% perlite and your plants will be happy. The cocoa will
[07:51.400 --> 07:53.360]  be plenty aerated for you.
[07:53.360 --> 07:58.520]  I will give a lot more detail about pot sizes later, but I generally start from a clone.
[07:58.520 --> 08:04.280]  I use an Easy Cloner. I go from the Easy Cloner into a four or six inch net pot with that
[08:04.280 --> 08:11.300]  70 to 30% mix. Then once the plants are large enough, I move them into a three gallon fabric
[08:11.420 --> 08:17.420]  pot. And that three gallon fabric pot, that's where I like to use the 70% cocoa, 20% perlite,
[08:17.420 --> 08:22.400]  10% persolite, very well mixed up in the three gallon pots.
[08:22.400 --> 08:26.820]  In my commercial environment, I finish in the three gallon pots. I like the time that
[08:26.820 --> 08:31.300]  it takes those pots to dry down. I'm able to get two waterings in a day on a very large
[08:31.300 --> 08:36.580]  plant and I'm able to fit enough pots on a table. I don't see a need to do larger pots.
[08:36.580 --> 08:41.300]  I don't see a need for more transplants. So I generally go from the cloner to a six
[08:41.300 --> 08:46.460]  inch net pot to a three gallon pot. And that is that plant's forever pot. That's its finishing
[08:46.460 --> 08:47.460]  home.
[08:47.460 --> 08:51.740]  While I am talking about cocoa and mixing your perlite and persolite, one thing I should
[08:51.740 --> 08:58.860]  mention for you is make sure you rinse your cocoa. Make sure you rinse your perlite. Make
[08:58.860 --> 09:04.780]  sure you rinse your persolite. Also wear a mask when you are playing with the perlite
[09:04.780 --> 09:10.780]  and persolite. We need to rinse all of these products because they are dirty. That cocoa
[09:10.780 --> 09:15.980]  was made overseas. It's a bunch of cocoa husks. It was crushed together, put into a container
[09:15.980 --> 09:21.060]  and shipped to the States on a ship. It may have a bunch of salts in it. It may have a
[09:21.060 --> 09:26.540]  bunch of unknown stuff in it. I don't know who you are buying your cocoa from. Some companies
[09:26.540 --> 09:33.100]  have very salty cocoa. So rinse that out before you put your plants in it or you will shock,
[09:33.100 --> 09:39.060]  burn and kill your plants. I also recommend you rinse your perlite and your persolite.
[09:39.060 --> 09:43.620]  I also recommend you wear that dust mask when you're working with the perlite and persolite
[09:43.620 --> 09:48.000]  because you don't want to breathe in that little dust that comes off of that stuff.
[09:48.000 --> 09:53.220]  It is like inhaling glass. It cannot be good for you. Please take care of yourself.
[09:53.220 --> 09:57.740]  All right, so we have covered the pots. We usually use a cloner. I like to use a clone
[09:57.740 --> 10:01.900]  machine or clone plugs. We'll talk more about that. Then I go into that four or six inch
[10:01.900 --> 10:08.660]  net pot. We've got my 70 to 30% mix. Then I will go into a three gallon fabric pot where
[10:08.660 --> 10:15.020]  I use that 70, 20, 10% mix. And my reminder, once again, rinse all of your stuff, your
[10:15.020 --> 10:19.180]  cocoa, your perlite, your persolite. Make sure you rinse all the excess salt out of
[10:19.180 --> 10:24.060]  your cocoa. Wash all that dust off the perlite and persolite and wear a mask when you're
[10:24.060 --> 10:25.740]  playing with the perlite and persolite.
[10:25.740 --> 10:30.140]  All right, I feel like we've got the containers covered. We are making great progress on this
[10:30.220 --> 10:36.260]  episode. In my commercial environments, I like to make an auto watering system. There
[10:36.260 --> 10:42.380]  are many variations on an auto watering system. In some places, I have machines mixing nutrients
[10:42.380 --> 10:47.620]  and no people have to even touch it. Little machines spit out this much cow mag, this
[10:47.620 --> 10:52.740]  much nitrogen, this much phosphorus into a reservoir. A mixer mixes it up for me. Another
[10:52.740 --> 10:57.020]  machine measures the pH. If it's too low or too high, it spits in the appropriate up or
[10:57.020 --> 11:01.500]  down. Then it feeds that to the plants. It's got a little sensor in some of the plants.
[11:01.500 --> 11:04.860]  When that moisture meter gets to the right meter, it stops watering. When it gets too
[11:04.860 --> 11:09.660]  dry, it waters again. Some facilities are very automated. Some of them, we've got to
[11:09.660 --> 11:14.180]  mix up the tanks ourselves. Then we plug in a pump and that pump waters.
[11:14.180 --> 11:19.260]  But in all situations, in all flower rooms, it is ideal that I have got some sort of a
[11:19.260 --> 11:25.160]  drip feed or a sprinkler or emitter or auto water system in all flower rooms. It is so
[11:25.200 --> 11:31.280]  much easier. It is much more consistent and the plants really enjoy and appreciate that
[11:31.280 --> 11:36.180]  type of consistency and timing and how much water they get. When you use the right type
[11:36.180 --> 11:41.760]  of emitter or a sprinkler, I think you really add just enough oxygen to the mix to make
[11:41.760 --> 11:44.760]  the plants go kapow when you water them.
[11:44.760 --> 11:49.640]  In my commercial environments, I have always got my flowering plants on some type of an
[11:49.640 --> 11:55.400]  auto watering system. Depending on the size of my plants and how old the plants are and
[11:55.400 --> 12:00.360]  the environment of the room, sometimes the plants get watered once per day. I like to
[12:00.360 --> 12:05.200]  water right as the lights come on. I like to water within the first hour of the lights
[12:05.200 --> 12:09.760]  coming on if I can. We're in a commercial environment. Sometimes we've got multiple
[12:09.760 --> 12:13.800]  rooms. Sometimes we've got a lot of plants. Sometimes we can't water every room right
[12:13.800 --> 12:16.800]  at nine o'clock because we can't be in every single room.
[12:16.840 --> 12:20.080]  When the lights come on at eight or when the lights come on at nine, I try to water this
[12:20.080 --> 12:23.680]  room as quickly as I can, then get to this one and then get to this one and get all of
[12:23.680 --> 12:27.920]  the plants watered within an hour of the lights coming on so they can use all of that water
[12:27.920 --> 12:32.560]  all day, metabolize all of those nutrients and just get to work and get to action.
[12:32.560 --> 12:36.680]  Honestly, in a commercial environment, by the time the lights come on, those plants
[12:36.680 --> 12:40.920]  are usually ready for a drink of water. They've had a long night. They've been growing. There's
[12:40.920 --> 12:45.560]  been a lot of activity. They're hungry. They're thirsty. I like to water right when the lights
[12:45.560 --> 12:50.680]  come on. Then if the plants are large enough, if you work in a commercial environment, you
[12:50.680 --> 12:54.760]  might want to water right before you leave. That way they aren't dead when you come back
[12:54.760 --> 12:55.760]  the next morning.
[12:55.760 --> 13:00.680]  So based on the size of the plants in a three-gallon pot, I'm usually watering first thing in the
[13:00.680 --> 13:05.920]  morning and then later in flower, I'm watering right as we leave for the end of the day.
[13:05.920 --> 13:12.920]  I like to water my plants to 20% runoff. I want runoff every time I feed and water those
[13:13.480 --> 13:19.000]  plants. Since I'm using cocoa, I am putting nutrients in my water every time. I am feeding
[13:19.000 --> 13:24.520]  these plants every time I water because cocoa does not hang on to the nutrients. The nutrients
[13:24.520 --> 13:28.920]  just fall right out. They rinse right out along with the water. So I'm adding nutrients
[13:28.920 --> 13:30.720]  at every watering.
[13:30.720 --> 13:37.040]  In most commercial environments in Colorado, I am not using RO water. In fact, at this
[13:37.040 --> 13:44.600]  time I am not using reverse osmosis water in any of my situations, in any of my cultivations.
[13:44.600 --> 13:48.480]  None of the commercial grows, none of my home grows, none of my friends grows that I'm helping
[13:48.480 --> 13:53.600]  with. We are not using any RO water. I think a big boy filter or something simple like
[13:53.600 --> 13:57.760]  that is good enough here in Colorado. We have got good water.
[13:57.760 --> 14:02.920]  Also when you start going with RO water, it makes it a little more challenging to pH balance
[14:02.920 --> 14:07.400]  everything. It's a little bit more of a struggle if you are not experienced and I don't find
[14:07.400 --> 14:12.320]  it necessary here in Colorado. We've got great water. They take good care of our water. There's
[14:12.320 --> 14:17.280]  no need to struggle with the RO. There's also a tremendous amount of waste when it comes
[14:17.280 --> 14:20.160]  to RO. So I do not do that.
[14:20.160 --> 14:25.960]  Something I do is I frequently check the pH and the EC of the water that comes out of
[14:25.960 --> 14:32.800]  my tap in all of my facilities and my home grows. Your local water company changes the
[14:32.800 --> 14:37.720]  chemicals they put in their treatment plants based on the season. We are using water for
[14:37.720 --> 14:41.520]  different things based on the seasons. We are using different amounts of water. I would
[14:41.520 --> 14:46.680]  imagine there are different problems that occur in water that are happening in different
[14:46.680 --> 14:49.600]  seasons. You probably get different algaes in the summer. You probably get different
[14:49.600 --> 14:53.760]  shit in the winter. It's probably different based on your location. So they treat the
[14:53.760 --> 14:58.800]  water differently at different times of the year. It's always a good idea just to get
[14:58.800 --> 15:02.560]  a little bit of water and put your pH pen in there, put your EC meter in there and just
[15:02.560 --> 15:06.800]  know what's coming out of your faucet. It's always good to know what you're starting with.
[15:06.800 --> 15:14.200]  So mark that down occasionally. Also, always mark down the pH and the EC or the PPMs or
[15:14.200 --> 15:20.760]  the TDS of any solution you mix to feed your plants. Make that a habit. When you mix up
[15:20.760 --> 15:26.120]  your nutrients, as soon as you're done, grab your pH meter and grab your PPM pen and just
[15:26.120 --> 15:30.480]  stick them both in your nutrient solution. Watch for it to register what it is. It should
[15:30.480 --> 15:35.080]  be somewhere between 6.1 and 6.5. And then I don't know what's on your EC meter over
[15:35.080 --> 15:38.880]  here. It may be real high. It may be real low. It just depends on who you are. But write
[15:38.880 --> 15:43.600]  that shit down. Why not? Maybe later, if you've got a problem, you can look back and you can
[15:43.600 --> 15:47.920]  go, oh, look, on Tuesday, I fed it way too high of PPMs and it didn't like that.
[15:47.920 --> 15:52.120]  Or when your crop is done and it's awesome, you can say, what did we do? I want to do
[15:52.120 --> 15:57.720]  that all over again. So I like to write down a lot of information. I write down everything
[15:57.720 --> 16:03.160]  I put in the mix. I've got a Google document for every commercial grow I work with. When
[16:03.160 --> 16:08.360]  the guys mix up something, they write exactly what they put in the mix. 5 mils of this,
[16:08.360 --> 16:12.800]  10 mils of this, 6 mils of this. They write it down. They write down the pH. They write
[16:12.800 --> 16:18.560]  down the EC. Then they water the plants. As the plants get watered, we collect a little
[16:18.560 --> 16:23.280]  bit of the runoff off of each table. So we have another Google document that says, room
[16:23.280 --> 16:30.760]  A, table 1, pH runoff, EC runoff. And we mark that for each table for each room. So we're
[16:30.760 --> 16:35.800]  documenting every nutrient that goes into the solution. Then we are documenting the
[16:35.800 --> 16:40.680]  pH of that solution. We are also documenting the PPMs of that solution before we feed it
[16:40.720 --> 16:46.680]  to the plants. Then we are also documenting the pH and PPM of the runoff that comes out
[16:46.680 --> 16:52.240]  of the pots after we water. Now, I rarely need to use that data for anything, but when
[16:52.240 --> 16:57.720]  I do need it, it is always very obvious where the problem started and what the problem was.
[16:57.720 --> 17:02.680]  It always helps us diagnose a problem, even if it's just through a process of elimination.
[17:02.680 --> 17:07.520]  We can look and see, look, the pH coming out is just fine. The EC coming out is just fine.
[17:07.520 --> 17:10.640]  So it's not the feed. It's got to be something else in the room. Let's look and see if we
[17:10.640 --> 17:15.760]  have got bugs. So that is why I document everything when I feed the plants. It sounds
[17:15.760 --> 17:20.280]  excessive, but when you've got multimillion dollar commercial facilities at your hands
[17:20.280 --> 17:26.200]  and you've got multiple guys and gals working in these places, you need accountability and
[17:26.200 --> 17:27.200]  documentation.
[17:27.200 --> 17:30.720]  And like I said a moment ago, if something goes wrong, it's always nice to be able to
[17:30.720 --> 17:35.840]  look back and say, this is where we messed up. But it's even better when shit goes right
[17:35.840 --> 17:41.480]  and you can look back and go do it exactly like this all over again. That way you've
[17:41.480 --> 17:46.760]  got every nutrient, you've got every reading you can imagine. Just replicate that. You
[17:46.760 --> 17:52.280]  can do it all over and you can have repeatable outcomes. Everybody gets bonus checks. Everybody's
[17:52.280 --> 17:53.280]  happy.
[17:53.280 --> 17:58.020]  All right. Another detail I should talk about is in my commercial environment is everything
[17:58.020 --> 18:04.440]  in flower is underneath a thousand watt Goveda double ended light. I like to use the thousand
[18:04.440 --> 18:08.720]  watt double ended bulbs in a commercial grow. I really think that's where I get the best
[18:08.720 --> 18:13.600]  performance from the plants. A lot of people will have different opinions and ideas. I've
[18:13.600 --> 18:18.900]  been doing it a lot. I've done it for a while. And my favorite is the Goveda thousand watt
[18:18.900 --> 18:23.800]  double ended bulb that works wonderfully for everything I've tried to put it through for
[18:23.800 --> 18:25.480]  every plant it performs.
[18:25.480 --> 18:30.500]  So that is what I use. I also like to have my plants up off the ground. So I use those
[18:30.500 --> 18:35.300]  greenhouse tables. I have them custom built for the length of the room. They are generally
[18:35.300 --> 18:39.640]  six foot wide and the length of the room. They come with trellis bars that you attach
[18:39.640 --> 18:45.300]  to the tables. I think the table sections are six or eight feet long and each six or
[18:45.300 --> 18:50.420]  eight foot long section. I know exactly how many plants of each strain fit in that section.
[18:50.420 --> 18:54.220]  I've got a very beautiful plan for setting up those tables.
[18:54.220 --> 18:58.660]  So I've got greenhouse tables that are the length of the room. They're six feet wide
[18:58.780 --> 19:02.500]  and they move 18 inches left or right so that you can function in the room. You can make
[19:02.500 --> 19:05.980]  an aisle and then when you're done working, you can push all of the tables all the way
[19:05.980 --> 19:09.660]  to the right side so that you can just have one walkway at the left side of the room and
[19:09.660 --> 19:13.920]  not waste a bunch of space. Those are the tables I like to use. And again, everything
[19:13.920 --> 19:18.380]  is on a drip feeder or some sort of an auto feeder. So you've got plants on tables. They're
[19:18.380 --> 19:23.060]  auto fed. It is really easy. It is really efficient to work in these rooms. It's really
[19:23.060 --> 19:26.380]  easy to get in there and hang up trellis. It's really easy to get in and bottom and
[19:26.380 --> 19:31.260]  defoliate. I've made it really easy for the crew to get work done in these rooms.
[19:31.260 --> 19:37.460]  So now let's focus on a few different approaches to feeding the plants. I keep talking about
[19:37.460 --> 19:42.300]  my commercial environments. In a commercial grow, we're watering every plant at least
[19:42.300 --> 19:47.140]  once a day. Sometimes we're watering plants twice a day, just depending on the performance
[19:47.140 --> 19:51.680]  and the environment and the pot size and how much water they go through. I understand that
[19:51.680 --> 19:58.640]  everybody is in a different situation. So I'm going to try to make this work for everybody's
[19:58.640 --> 20:05.600]  grow. Also keep in mind that everything I say works for me. None of this is set in stone.
[20:05.600 --> 20:12.240]  This is not a rule book. This is not a Bible. This is my standard operating procedure. You
[20:12.240 --> 20:17.440]  can adjust this to work for you however you want. You can add, you can subtract steps.
[20:17.440 --> 20:22.540]  You can modify this to work however you would like. I'm just trying to share with you my
[20:22.540 --> 20:28.520]  standard operating procedure and I encourage you to adjust this and custom tailor this
[20:28.520 --> 20:32.680]  to work for your grow. And again, I'm going to try to give you examples to where this
[20:32.680 --> 20:36.400]  will work for multiple different setups.
[20:36.400 --> 20:41.800]  In my first example, I will tell you what I do in my commercial environments. In a commercial
[20:41.800 --> 20:46.720]  grow environment where I'm watering every day, sometimes multiple times a day, I don't
[20:46.720 --> 20:52.560]  find it necessary to feed every nutrient or every bottle or every product to my plants
[20:52.560 --> 20:57.720]  every time I water them. I'm going to get a lot of opportunities to feed these plants
[20:57.720 --> 21:02.960]  so I break up the nutrients throughout the week. In a big commercial grow, I will feed
[21:02.960 --> 21:09.240]  base nutrients at every watering. So if I'm using VegBloom, I will put in a VegBloom base
[21:09.240 --> 21:16.000]  mix at every watering. If I'm using New Millennium, I will use either Autumn Gold or Summer Shift
[21:16.040 --> 21:22.520]  or Equinox or something similar to that at every watering. Then I will rotate a series
[21:22.520 --> 21:28.000]  of other products, which I call boosts, throughout the week. So on Monday, we will add those
[21:28.000 --> 21:32.920]  base nutrients, whether it's the VegBloom mix or if it's the New Millennium base mix,
[21:32.920 --> 21:34.160]  I will start with that.
[21:34.160 --> 21:39.120]  But then on Monday, maybe I'll add something like CalMag. And then on Tuesday, maybe we'll
[21:39.120 --> 21:44.920]  add something like Plus Life. And then on Wednesday, maybe we'll add Epsom salts. But
[21:44.920 --> 21:49.980]  I will add different things throughout the week so the plants get fed all of those different
[21:49.980 --> 21:54.200]  nutrients or all of those different products, but I don't blast them to the plant all at
[21:54.200 --> 22:00.360]  one time. So I will do a base mix on every watering, and then I will write a list of
[22:00.360 --> 22:04.640]  boosts. And they will be... I'm just being hypothetical because I don't have a week or
[22:04.640 --> 22:09.880]  I don't have an idea right now, but I'll write on the board, CalMag, Plus Life, Lightning
[22:09.880 --> 22:13.320]  Start, Epsom salts, maybe something like that in a row.
[22:13.320 --> 22:16.800]  There may be three of them. There may be seven of them for the entire week. But what
[22:16.800 --> 22:21.240]  we do is we just rotate through that list. So like I said, on Monday, you mix up your
[22:21.240 --> 22:25.360]  base nudes. We're going to use base nutrients every time. You look at the list, you go,
[22:25.360 --> 22:30.320]  oh, it says CalMag. So you put however much CalMag is required into the mix, and then
[22:30.320 --> 22:35.080]  you just write the date next to it. I put CalMag in here on Monday the 1st. And that
[22:35.080 --> 22:39.800]  way we know Monday the 1st, they got CalMag. Tuesday, when we come in, we do the base nutrients
[22:39.800 --> 22:43.280]  because we do that every day. You just move to the second one on the list. I don't know
[22:44.240 --> 22:47.280]  what I said. I'm going to guess that it was probably Plus Life. So we mix in the appropriate
[22:47.280 --> 22:51.440]  amount of Plus Life and then you mark on the board. On Tuesday the 2nd, I added Plus Life.
[22:51.440 --> 22:55.440]  So on the 3rd or on the 4th day, whatever, because by day four, people start getting
[22:55.440 --> 23:00.040]  confused if it's me working, if it's another guy working. He just looks at the board and
[23:00.040 --> 23:04.200]  goes, today is the 4th. I've got to put in the 4th product. And if he's at the bottom
[23:04.200 --> 23:07.480]  of the list and we've done them all, you just simply go back to the top of the list and
[23:07.480 --> 23:08.960]  start all over again.
[23:08.960 --> 23:13.720]  And that makes it very easy to keep those boost products fed to the plants. It's a very
[23:13.720 --> 23:18.640]  easy way to schedule it. And it's a very easy way to keep my staff on top of what has been
[23:18.640 --> 23:24.440]  done and what needs to be done. And as a backup plan, we're also writing all of those nutrients
[23:24.440 --> 23:29.120]  that were put into the solution in that Google document. So if somebody forgot to update
[23:29.120 --> 23:32.640]  the board or if you're not sure what was on the board, maybe you can't read some handwriting
[23:32.640 --> 23:36.800]  or something, you've always got that Google document as a backup plan.
[23:36.800 --> 23:42.160]  So that method, we're going to call that the base nutrients every day and add a boost
[23:42.160 --> 23:46.420]  throughout the week method. That's the rotate the boost method. I don't really have a name
[23:46.420 --> 23:51.360]  for it, but that's how we do it. I use base nutrients every day and then we add a booster
[23:51.360 --> 23:55.780]  throughout the week. And I will do this to my veg plants and my flower plants. That is
[23:55.780 --> 23:59.920]  how I assign nutrient schedules in a commercial environment.
[23:59.920 --> 24:05.560]  Another way to do this is a lot of people like to mix up a big fat tank of really strong
[24:05.560 --> 24:10.000]  nutrient mix on Monday, feed it everything. What are we going to feed the plants this
[24:10.000 --> 24:15.120]  week? They get it all on Monday. Every product, every bottle, every nutrient, put it all in
[24:15.120 --> 24:19.360]  there, feed the plants all of that on Monday. Then throughout the week, since we're feeding
[24:19.360 --> 24:23.600]  in cocoa, we're just going to feed them base nutrients, maybe some cow mag because they
[24:23.600 --> 24:28.380]  will need it if we're just feeding them on Mondays. That method does work. It works for
[24:28.380 --> 24:33.360]  some people, it works in a commercial grow, but that is not my preferred method.
[24:33.360 --> 24:38.080]  Another way to do it is to simply fill your reservoir on Monday, put everything you need
[24:38.080 --> 24:41.960]  in there and use that reservoir throughout the week and just keep feeding it that same
[24:41.960 --> 24:47.880]  nutrient mix all week. You have got several options. You can do what works for you. Again,
[24:47.880 --> 24:53.760]  the thing that I do is I feed my base nutrients every day and throughout the week, I rotate
[24:53.760 --> 24:57.360]  different add-ons or different boosts into my mix.
[24:57.360 --> 25:01.740]  You may have to make decisions based on how often you're available or how often you're
[25:01.740 --> 25:06.580]  able to mix nutrients. Can you mix up your nutrients every single day like I like to
[25:06.580 --> 25:12.200]  do? Can you be there every day to mix those nutrients? Can you mix a fresh batch of nutrients
[25:12.200 --> 25:16.600]  every single morning or can you only show up on Monday? Can you only show up on Mondays
[25:16.600 --> 25:21.140]  and Wednesdays? Those are going to be the things that determine how you mix and how
[25:21.140 --> 25:26.180]  often you mix and how you run your nutrient regimen. I am a very hands-on grower. I've
[25:26.180 --> 25:30.220]  got a very hands-on staff. Maybe that's a big part of it for me is I know that I've
[25:30.220 --> 25:34.400]  got a staff and I know there's going to be people there seven days a week that are going
[25:34.400 --> 25:38.860]  to be able to hand mix these nutrients if I need them to and make sure that every plant
[25:38.860 --> 25:40.900]  gets the appropriate feeding.
[25:40.900 --> 25:44.780]  Many people don't have that luxury. Many people want to take a day off. Many people want to
[25:44.780 --> 25:49.380]  go on vacation. Many people have a day job and a family and they aren't able to focus
[25:49.380 --> 25:55.060]  and spend that much time on a grow every single day. Those are going to be the types of determining
[25:55.060 --> 26:00.100]  factors that decide how you set up your grow and your watering style.
[26:00.100 --> 26:03.420]  So you've got a couple of options. Do you want to mix everything on Monday and feed
[26:03.420 --> 26:07.620]  that throughout the week? Do you want to do base nutrients and boosts every day of the
[26:07.620 --> 26:12.380]  week? Do you want to feed a big blast on Monday and then just do nutrients and cow mag throughout
[26:12.380 --> 26:16.100]  the week? Those are things you'll have to think about and plan ahead. Are you going
[26:16.100 --> 26:20.500]  on vacation? Are you going to have visitors? Are you going to have to take a new job? Something's
[26:20.500 --> 26:24.220]  going to come up. So just plan ahead when you were thinking about how you were going
[26:24.260 --> 26:27.300]  to water and mix your nutrients.
[26:27.300 --> 26:32.100]  Another thing I should talk about is clean your reservoir. Whatever you are mixing your
[26:32.100 --> 26:36.300]  nutrients in, whatever container or tank you are keeping your nutrient solution in, it
[26:36.300 --> 26:43.380]  is going to get funky. Drain it occasionally. Let it get completely dry. Clean it. Use some
[26:43.380 --> 26:47.820]  sort of a product and clean it really well. Then once you've cleaned it really well, let
[26:47.820 --> 26:52.700]  it dry. Then rinse it out really well to make sure there is no leftover cleaner in there
[26:52.780 --> 26:58.140]  so we don't mix that up with our nutrient solution and cause problems to our plants.
[26:58.140 --> 27:02.700]  Another thing I should have mentioned previously but it just now dawned on me is please make
[27:02.700 --> 27:08.620]  sure to calibrate your pH meters and your PPM meters and any sort of meter or device
[27:08.620 --> 27:13.740]  you are using that gives you a reading. Please calibrate that stuff at least once a month.
[27:13.740 --> 27:16.660]  I recommend every week if you can take the time.
[27:16.660 --> 27:20.680]  All right. I feel like we have got a good foundation. We know what kind of pots to use.
[27:20.680 --> 27:24.600]  We know what to put in the pots. We know that we are auto-feeding these plants. We
[27:24.600 --> 27:28.560]  know that these pots are on tables. We know they are under 1,000 watt lights. We have
[27:28.560 --> 27:33.040]  talked about a few different options on when and how to mix up our nutrients and how to
[27:33.040 --> 27:39.160]  water the plants. Now I think it is time to actually get more in-depth on the nutrient
[27:39.160 --> 27:40.400]  mix.
[27:40.400 --> 27:45.040]  I am going to break this up into several episodes. It may be two. It may be three. It could end
[27:45.040 --> 27:49.280]  up being four episodes. I'm not sure. I am at the first episode so I can't tell how long
[27:49.280 --> 27:55.280]  it is going to take yet. But the schedule that I am going to give for my nutrients is
[27:55.280 --> 28:01.560]  a nine-week flowering phase. We are going to focus on a nine-week flowering phase. Everything
[28:01.560 --> 28:08.800]  I talk about is probably measured in milliliters per gallon or grams per gallon. Some of the
[28:08.800 --> 28:14.400]  things I use are dry powdered nutrients. I will try to be specific. If it changes, I
[28:14.400 --> 28:20.760]  will really try to pay attention and talk about different units of measure very specifically.
[28:20.760 --> 28:26.240]  I said at the start of the show that this works for me and my growth style and my plants
[28:26.240 --> 28:31.420]  in my environment. You have to pay attention to your plants. You have to pay attention
[28:31.420 --> 28:37.520]  to your leaves. I highly recommend doing runoff reports. I will do a full episode on runoff
[28:37.520 --> 28:41.920]  reports way in the future. That one will be a long ways away. I've got a lot of stuff
[28:41.920 --> 28:43.720]  planned before that.
[28:44.160 --> 28:50.860]  You must pay attention to the plants. No matter what I say, no matter what you think, no matter
[28:50.860 --> 28:56.860]  what your equipment says, no matter what your meters say, the plants are the boss. If they
[28:56.860 --> 29:02.240]  don't look happy, adjust. The plants are not going to adjust to the meters. You have to
[29:02.240 --> 29:08.960]  adjust everything to the plants. Pay attention to them. The plants are always the boss. You're
[29:08.960 --> 29:14.040]  not the boss. The owner of the facility is not the boss. The investors are not the boss.
[29:14.040 --> 29:19.600]  The consumers are not the boss. All of those plants in that grow room, those are your bosses.
[29:19.600 --> 29:23.440]  It's like you've got a whole room full of girlfriends and you've got to learn to make
[29:23.440 --> 29:24.440]  all of them happy.
[29:24.440 --> 29:27.960]  All right, you guys, I just realized I've been talking for like 30 minutes. I could
[29:27.960 --> 29:32.720]  use a drink. I really need a dab. I'm going to press pause for a moment. When I get back,
[29:32.720 --> 29:39.960]  I will tell you how I mix up my clone solution and we will get this mix episode really moving.
[29:39.960 --> 29:42.200]  Take a dab with me and I'll be right back.
[29:42.200 --> 29:47.440]  All right, podcast world, I am back. I am heavily medicated. During my break, I took
[29:47.440 --> 29:54.760]  a bunch of fat dabs of Cowboy Kush Full Spectrum Extract. This is a blend of HA, OG, and Stardog.
[29:54.760 --> 30:00.160]  The flavor is described as earthy, fuel, and leather. I really enjoy that funky, earthy,
[30:00.160 --> 30:04.840]  fuel-y flavor. I'm not sure I got leather out of it. What I did get was a punch to the
[30:04.840 --> 30:08.840]  face. This one kind of makes me lazy. It makes me want to sit down and chill out. It also
[30:08.840 --> 30:13.840]  makes me nice and focused. So this should be good podcast concentrates.
[30:13.840 --> 30:18.040]  Let's jump right back into it. Before I took my dab break, I said I was going to tell you
[30:18.040 --> 30:25.200]  how I mix my solution for my cloners. In a commercial environment, I run easy cloners.
[30:25.200 --> 30:30.840]  I run turbo cloners. I run all of the automated aero cloners you can think of. I also run
[30:30.840 --> 30:38.320]  the traditional tray and dome type clone setup. In all of those environments, I use that basic
[30:38.320 --> 30:45.680]  purple Clonex dipping solution and the yellow Clonex cloning solution. If I am using the
[30:45.680 --> 30:51.160]  tray and clone plug and dome technique to make my clones, I will generally buy a bunch
[30:51.160 --> 30:57.640]  of Rapid Router clone plugs. Then I will soak those Rapid Routers in a solution. It
[30:57.640 --> 31:02.840]  is just water and the yellow Clonex cloning solution. Not the purple dipping stuff, but
[31:02.840 --> 31:10.280]  the yellow solution in the taller bottle. I will mix that to approximately a 1.0 to
[31:10.280 --> 31:20.600]  1.2 EC, and I will adjust the pH of that solution to 5.7 to 6.2. Then I put those Rapid Routers
[31:20.680 --> 31:25.560]  in the little trays and their little slots. I cut the clones. I dip them into the purple
[31:25.560 --> 31:31.480]  Clonex solution and put them gently into the clone plug. Then I place a dome over those
[31:31.480 --> 31:37.600]  clones. I close the vents and I put it under a T5 light with that light fairly close, and
[31:37.600 --> 31:43.840]  I do not touch those clones for approximately three to five days. I basically ignore them
[31:43.840 --> 31:48.520]  until it looks like they need some water. When they need water, I will re-moisten them
[31:48.520 --> 31:53.400]  again with that same solution, not the same bucket. I won't have that same solution laying
[31:53.400 --> 32:00.280]  around. I will remix a fresh batch of the same solution. It is water and that Clonex
[32:00.280 --> 32:07.440]  yellow solution. I'll mix it up in an EC of 1.0 to 1.2, and again, I will adjust the pH
[32:07.440 --> 32:13.800]  to 5.7 to 6.2, and I will saturate those clone plugs. I'll let it sit open for a minute while
[32:13.800 --> 32:18.880]  those plugs are saturated. Then before I close it, I will dump off all of the water
[32:18.880 --> 32:22.780]  that has ran out of those plugs that is in the tray. That way they're not sitting in
[32:22.780 --> 32:27.000]  too much stagnant water, but the clone plugs are nice and saturated. I'll put the dome
[32:27.000 --> 32:31.860]  back on there and probably leave them alone for a day or two before I begin cracking those
[32:31.860 --> 32:37.400]  vents slowly and start introducing more airflow to those clones. But that is basically the
[32:37.400 --> 32:44.160]  feed, the mix that I use for my clones in a clone tray. I do a very similar thing to
[32:44.160 --> 32:50.600]  my clones in an EZ-Cloner or a Turbo-Cloner. One of the most important things is to clean
[32:50.600 --> 32:57.720]  everything on the Turbo-Cloner or the EZ-Cloner. Make sure it is sanitary and sterilized. I
[32:57.720 --> 33:03.000]  like to sanitize the cloner and the clone plugs every time I use it. So start off with
[33:03.000 --> 33:09.880]  a clean machine and set yourself up for success. Then fill your reservoir on your clone machine
[33:09.880 --> 33:18.040]  to the appropriate level and add the yellow Clonex solution until you reach an EC of 1.0
[33:18.040 --> 33:23.420]  to 1.2. This is really easy to do. You've got your water in the reservoir to the level
[33:23.420 --> 33:30.040]  you want it. Put your EC meter in there and add a very small amount of the Clonex solution.
[33:30.040 --> 33:34.160]  Now stir that around with your meter. Make sure you're stirring it all around. Get that
[33:34.160 --> 33:40.080]  solution all in that water. Now, what does your EC meter say? Does it say 0.6? Does it
[33:40.080 --> 33:47.800]  say 1.0? If it says 0.6, you obviously need to add a little bit more. Go very slowly when
[33:47.800 --> 33:55.600]  you are adding your nutrient solution, but slowly add until you reach that EC of 1.0
[33:55.600 --> 34:01.440]  to 1.2. And if you go a little bit too high, you can just add more water and dilute it.
[34:01.440 --> 34:05.720]  This may take a couple of tries to get it right. Try to pay attention to how much of
[34:05.720 --> 34:12.720]  the solution you added to the water to achieve that 1.0 to 1.2 EC. And maybe write down,
[34:12.720 --> 34:17.180]  I used 30 mils and it got me really close. And then I had to start using a dropper to
[34:17.180 --> 34:21.840]  get it dialed in where I wanted it. Or maybe you need 50 mils. I don't know how big your
[34:21.840 --> 34:26.160]  reservoir is, so I don't know how much to tell you to use. I can tell you to get it
[34:26.160 --> 34:32.600]  to 1.0 to 1.2. And it's fun learning how to dial that in. You add solution, you measure
[34:32.600 --> 34:36.520]  it, you say I'm too high or too low, you either add more solution or you don't. Then it's
[34:36.520 --> 34:40.240]  way too high. Now you have to add water. You end up putting in more solution. You just
[34:40.240 --> 34:42.640]  keep playing that game until you get it right.
[34:42.640 --> 34:48.440]  Once you have got the appropriate EC, that is when you adjust the pH. Do not adjust the
[34:48.560 --> 34:54.960]  pH until after you have achieved the appropriate EC. If you are going to add more water or
[34:54.960 --> 34:59.100]  more nutrients, there is no need to correct the pH at this time. You're going to have
[34:59.100 --> 35:03.960]  to do it again. So you've got your reservoir, it is filled appropriately. It's got the right
[35:03.960 --> 35:09.800]  solution in it. It is at the right pH. Then I cut my clones. I dip them into that purple
[35:09.800 --> 35:15.360]  CloneX gel. I put them in the clone collar. I put them to where they stick about, I think
[35:15.360 --> 35:18.880]  that's about an inch, maybe a little more, maybe a little bit less than an inch is exposed
[35:18.880 --> 35:23.280]  on the bottom side of the clone collar. So the water being misted hits the bottom of
[35:23.280 --> 35:29.160]  that clone and makes big fat roots. Any part that is going to be under the clone collar,
[35:29.160 --> 35:32.680]  I try to coat it in the CloneX solution.
[35:32.680 --> 35:37.000]  I've done a very in-depth episode on cutting clones in an EasyCloner, so we don't need
[35:37.000 --> 35:43.440]  to talk too much about that here. But the next day you will find that all of that purple
[35:43.520 --> 35:49.160]  gel has fallen off of your clones and it is now in your water, in your reservoir, in
[35:49.160 --> 35:55.120]  your cloner. I suggest that you unplug the cloner, take the top portion off of the cloner.
[35:55.120 --> 35:58.760]  This is where all the clones are. Take that off and just set it on the table. If you set
[35:58.760 --> 36:02.520]  it down on a level table, you won't damage the clones. They're not sticking out far enough
[36:02.520 --> 36:06.280]  to cause any problems. Just set that down somewhere where you don't mess up the bottoms
[36:06.280 --> 36:10.880]  of the clones. Those will be safe for a few minutes without getting sprayed on the bottom.
[36:10.880 --> 36:17.680]  Use your meters to measure your pH and your EC. All of that purple CloneX gel solution
[36:17.680 --> 36:24.000]  dripping off of your clones has changed the pH and the EC of the water in that reservoir.
[36:24.000 --> 36:31.200]  Also, that sprayer spraying overnight has changed the pH and the EC of the water in that reservoir.
[36:31.200 --> 36:35.560]  You've had some evaporation, you've had some mix time, you've introduced more oxygen. Things
[36:35.560 --> 36:40.680]  have changed over the past 12 or 24 hours and we need to correct them so that our clones
[36:40.720 --> 36:46.360]  will survive. So open up the cloner, use your meters, investigate, find out the numbers
[36:46.360 --> 36:52.200]  and adjust accordingly. If the pH went too high, make it lower. If the pH went too low,
[36:52.200 --> 36:57.800]  make it higher. If the EC is too low, make it higher. If the EC has gotten too high,
[36:57.800 --> 37:01.120]  add more water because some water may have sprayed out of the cloner, some water may
[37:01.120 --> 37:05.800]  have evaporated. I don't know what could have happened overnight in your cloner. There are
[37:05.800 --> 37:10.960]  countless opportunities and possibilities when it comes to working with easy cloners.
[37:10.960 --> 37:15.280]  So while we've got the cloner open, this is a good time to add another product. I like
[37:15.280 --> 37:22.320]  to add something called Clear Res. I like to add Clear Res today and every five days.
[37:22.320 --> 37:26.400]  That means we need to mark it down. Whatever the date is today when you're adding the Clear
[37:26.400 --> 37:32.760]  Res, write, I put Clear Res in here on Tuesday the 1st. Then on the 6th, you need to add
[37:32.760 --> 37:39.000]  30 more milliliters of Clear Res. And if that cloner is going again in five more days,
[37:39.000 --> 37:43.440]  add 30 more mils. And it probably shouldn't be going for another round of Clear Res, but
[37:43.440 --> 37:49.120]  if it is, make sure you add it and write it down every time. This may sound crazy, but
[37:49.120 --> 37:54.240]  even if you run the grow by yourself, write things down like somebody else is going to
[37:54.240 --> 37:59.880]  come and help you out. Act like there is another person that needs that information because
[38:00.000 --> 38:04.680]  We are cannabis consumers. We have a lot on our mind. The world is overwhelming. Take
[38:04.680 --> 38:09.800]  a lot of notes, help yourself out, set yourself up for success. Just leave yourself a little
[38:09.800 --> 38:14.600]  note, a little hint, a little path, a little treasure map. Give yourself a clue. Take as
[38:14.600 --> 38:20.160]  many detailed notes as you can. So make sure you mark down when you are putting Clear Res
[38:20.160 --> 38:24.200]  in the reservoir so that you know that it does get done.
[38:24.200 --> 38:28.200]  At this point, you have basically got your easy cloner on autopilot. All you have to
[38:28.200 --> 38:33.040]  do is open it up every morning and check the EC and check the pH. And if those are
[38:33.040 --> 38:37.800]  correct, you can leave it alone. If one of those needs to be adjusted, adjust accordingly.
[38:37.800 --> 38:43.520]  If the EC has gone too high because water is evaporated, add water. After you add water,
[38:43.520 --> 38:50.200]  check the pH again. It will need to be adjusted. If the EC has gone too low, add more nutrient
[38:50.200 --> 38:55.520]  solution. After that, correct the pH again. You're always going to be checking and adjusting
[38:55.520 --> 39:01.840]  the pH in these easy cloners. It is very important, but it will make strong, fat, healthy
[39:01.840 --> 39:05.840]  clones. I think the clones that come from these easy cloners, I personally think they
[39:05.840 --> 39:10.120]  take off a little more quickly and they're a little more healthy than the clones that
[39:10.120 --> 39:14.320]  come from the clone plugs. I think they just have a little more kabang to them.
[39:14.320 --> 39:20.240]  So that is my basic feed for my clones. I am basically mixing up that yellow CloneX
[39:20.240 --> 39:29.240]  clone solution at an EC of 1.0 to 1.2. And then I'm adjusting my pH to 5.7 to 6.2. And
[39:29.240 --> 39:33.920]  I am doing that if I'm using Rapid Router or whatever type of clone plugs, even if it's
[39:33.920 --> 39:38.920]  a Rockwool plug, I'll do the same mix. And if I'm using a Turbo cloner or an Easy cloner
[39:38.920 --> 39:44.300]  or some type of an Aero cloner, I use the exact same mix. I just have more maintenance
[39:44.300 --> 39:46.640]  and more things to do throughout the week.
[39:46.640 --> 39:50.280]  There is one more detail I should mention when it comes to cloning. I do personally
[39:50.280 --> 39:55.880]  like Permaclone clone collars. Yes, that is a blatant advertisement for a product, but
[39:55.880 --> 40:00.800]  I like them because they don't get moldy and they don't get funky and they don't fall apart
[40:00.800 --> 40:07.240]  and you can sanitize them and reuse them. Reusable clone collars are worth every penny
[40:07.240 --> 40:11.920]  in my opinion. That's less stuff to throw away. That's less stuff to buy again, and
[40:11.920 --> 40:18.080]  we can just sanitize it and keep using it. So I recommend Permaclone clone collars.
[40:18.080 --> 40:23.880]  Now let's work our way into talking about the small veg mix. Once my plants come from
[40:23.880 --> 40:29.160]  the cloner, I put them into a four inch or a six inch net pot. This is where I like to
[40:29.160 --> 40:36.920]  use 70% cocoa and 30% perlite. These plants are going to be in these four to six inch
[40:36.920 --> 40:42.120]  net pots for approximately two to four weeks. It just depends on the strain and how these
[40:42.120 --> 40:47.920]  plants perform, but be prepared for them to be in these pots for approximately two to
[40:47.920 --> 40:52.800]  four weeks. Some of your faster growing strains, they'll be ready for an up pot in approximately
[40:52.800 --> 40:57.720]  two weeks. Some of your OGs and your slower growing cushes, we'll leave them in these
[40:57.720 --> 41:01.160]  tighter pots for closer to four weeks.
[41:01.160 --> 41:06.560]  Now let's talk about what we're going to feed our small veg plants. I consider these small
[41:06.600 --> 41:12.200]  veg until I transplant them into their three gallon pots, then they will become large veg.
[41:12.200 --> 41:18.880]  So this is what I feed my small veg plants. I've got two options for base nutrients. In
[41:18.880 --> 41:25.200]  some of my facilities, I am running veg bloom powdered nutrients. I'm sure you have seen
[41:25.200 --> 41:31.600]  the veg plus bloom logo at your local grocery store or somewhere online. I really enjoy,
[41:31.600 --> 41:38.520]  I really am satisfied with the outcome and the quality of my product when I use veg bloom
[41:38.520 --> 41:40.720]  base nutrients.
[41:40.720 --> 41:46.400]  Veg bloom offers several different types of base nutrients, depending on the type of water
[41:46.400 --> 41:51.920]  you have in your location. They offer an RO base nutrient, which is for reverse osmosis
[41:51.920 --> 41:57.360]  water. They offer a dirty, which is for places with what they consider dirty water. They
[41:57.400 --> 42:02.760]  offer another product called hard, which is for places with what we would consider hard
[42:02.760 --> 42:07.760]  water. They recommend a water test. You check your water, you look on their website and
[42:07.760 --> 42:14.120]  they will make the appropriate recommendation of base nutrient for your grow. In most cases,
[42:14.120 --> 42:19.280]  you're probably going to want the dirty or the HD unless you're running RO water, then
[42:19.280 --> 42:21.840]  you obviously want RO.
[42:21.960 --> 42:27.520]  In many cases, I am running veg bloom base nutrients, but also in many facilities, I
[42:27.520 --> 42:33.400]  do like to use New Millennium nutrients. New Millennium makes a great line of nutrients.
[42:33.400 --> 42:38.000]  I really like the way the plants perform and I really like the way they have broken down
[42:38.000 --> 42:41.320]  the bottles and the way to feed the plants.
[42:41.320 --> 42:47.800]  I will give you a couple of different options of how I feed my small veg plants. Most of
[42:47.800 --> 42:52.440]  the time, my veg plants are hand watered. They are not in an auto watering system until
[42:52.440 --> 42:57.480]  they get into their three gallon pots. These are being watered by a pitcher or something
[42:57.480 --> 43:02.400]  similar to that. They're getting watered by a person who is paying attention to every
[43:02.400 --> 43:06.600]  plant. My nutrient solution is usually mixed into a large reservoir. We've usually got
[43:06.600 --> 43:12.480]  30 or 50 gallon reservoirs for the bedrooms. This is what I am mixing into my nutrient
[43:12.480 --> 43:21.440]  reservoirs. I usually start with five grams of veg bloom powdered base nutrients per gallon
[43:21.440 --> 43:22.440]  of water.
[43:22.440 --> 43:27.400]  Okay, if I'm using veg bloom, I'll repeat that. If I am using veg bloom, I use five
[43:27.400 --> 43:35.280]  grams of powdered base nutrients per gallon of water if I'm using veg bloom. If I am not
[43:35.280 --> 43:41.780]  using veg bloom, I will use, and pay attention because I don't use these at the same time.
[43:41.780 --> 43:48.060]  I either use veg bloom or New Millennium. If I use the New Millennium in my small veg,
[43:48.060 --> 43:57.220]  I will use three milliliters per gallon of Equinox and nine milliliters per gallon of
[43:57.220 --> 44:02.160]  Summer Shift. Okay, so we've got two different options here. You've got the veg bloom or
[44:02.160 --> 44:09.140]  the New Millennium base. Then I will add this to whichever base I have chosen to use. I
[44:09.140 --> 44:17.700]  will use five milliliters per gallon of water of Ruby, and I will also use one milliliter
[44:17.700 --> 44:23.660]  per gallon of water of Lightning Start. So we are either using that veg bloom base mix,
[44:23.660 --> 44:30.000]  or we are using the New Millennium base mix. Don't use both bases. You will burn the plants.
[44:30.000 --> 44:36.740]  Then to that base mix, every day I am adding five milliliters of Ruby and one milliliter
[44:36.740 --> 44:41.520]  of Lightning Start. And I want this to be very clear that you do not use both of those
[44:41.520 --> 44:48.880]  bases because you will ruin your plants. So one example for the base would be three milliliters
[44:48.880 --> 44:55.520]  of Equinox and nine milliliters of Summer Shift, along with five milliliters of Ruby
[44:55.520 --> 45:02.460]  and one milliliter of Lightning Start. That is one base setup. The other base setup option
[45:02.460 --> 45:11.640]  is five grams of veg bloom base nutrients plus five milliliters of Ruby plus one milliliter
[45:11.640 --> 45:16.220]  of Lightning Start. Those are your options. Don't do both of them, please. I hope I made
[45:16.220 --> 45:21.100]  that very clear. Now we are going to feed one of those as a base mix. If you were doing
[45:21.100 --> 45:25.980]  the daily blast, they get that every day. If you're doing the Monday mix, they get that
[45:25.980 --> 45:33.040]  every Monday. Now these are the things that I would add to that mix as a boost on a daily
[45:33.040 --> 45:40.320]  rotation. I would start off with Plus Life. The day I transplant those plants, I would
[45:40.320 --> 45:47.020]  like to mix a half gram per gallon of water of Plus Life into my nutrient solution and
[45:47.020 --> 45:53.260]  feed it to the plants on day one of transplant to get that mycorrhizal fungus and get those
[45:53.260 --> 45:58.200]  beneficial bacterias started in my plants. Just get them nice and healthy. Get those
[45:58.200 --> 46:05.000]  roots going. So I start with a half a gram of Plus Life. That is my first boost. My second
[46:05.000 --> 46:13.120]  boost is CalMag. I cannot recommend how much CalMag you feed your small plants because
[46:13.120 --> 46:20.040]  I do not know which brand of CalMag you have purchased. I don't want to make a recommendation
[46:20.040 --> 46:26.880]  and ruin your plants. On your bottle of CalMag, it will recommend how much to feed your plants
[46:26.880 --> 46:33.920]  based on their size. When your plants are little, I recommend you use half of what that
[46:33.920 --> 46:39.700]  bottle recommends. They're going to suggest a little bit more so that you use more so
[46:39.700 --> 46:45.120]  that you have to buy more. I think you can get away with half of that bottle's recommended
[46:45.120 --> 46:51.280]  CalMag while your plants are little. So on day one, we're going to boost with Plus Life.
[46:51.280 --> 46:59.040]  On day two, we're going to boost with CalMag. On day three, I want to use five milliliters
[46:59.040 --> 47:04.960]  of Lightning Start per gallon of water. So if you're mixing up a 10-gallon res, you're
[47:04.960 --> 47:12.440]  going to put 50 milliliters of Lightning Start into that reservoir. So we've got five milliliters
[47:12.440 --> 47:20.480]  of Lightning Start as our third boost. Then on day four, I would like to use one gram
[47:20.480 --> 47:28.240]  of Epsom salts per gallon of water as my boost on day four. So we are using our base nutrient
[47:28.240 --> 47:34.720]  mix every single day. Then throughout the week, we are rotating our boosts. We are starting
[47:34.720 --> 47:39.360]  with Plus Life, then we're moving to CalMag, then we're doing Lightning Start, and then
[47:39.360 --> 47:45.760]  on day four, we are adding Epsom salts. On day five, I do not add a boost. I will skip
[47:45.760 --> 47:51.240]  that day. Then on day six, we're going to go right back around and start with that Plus
[47:51.240 --> 47:57.920]  Life again and repeat the cycle. And I will repeat that cycle on my small veg plants until
[47:57.920 --> 48:04.000]  the day they are transplanted into their three-gallon pots and they begin receiving their large
[48:04.000 --> 48:11.640]  veg feed. Now for your small veg mix, feeding in cocoa with a nice perlite mix, I do recommend
[48:11.640 --> 48:20.880]  you adjust the pH of your solution to 6.1 to 6.4 before watering your plants. So that
[48:20.880 --> 48:26.160]  is the small vegetative mix, and we're going to feed that again until we transplant them
[48:26.160 --> 48:30.720]  into the three-gallon pots. Now I know I've said this a lot. I know I repeated this a
[48:30.720 --> 48:36.820]  whole bunch, but do not double up on those bases that I talked about. Either use a New
[48:36.820 --> 48:44.080]  Millennium base or use a Veg Bloom base. Either one will work wonderfully, and it is up to
[48:44.080 --> 48:50.400]  you. It is okay to use a Veg Bloom base and New Millennium additives. It is okay to use
[48:50.400 --> 48:55.040]  a certain brand and add another brand if you understand what you are doing. I've got a
[48:55.040 --> 48:59.560]  pretty good map here, and I will get us to our goal. I understand what I'm doing. As
[48:59.560 --> 49:05.320]  long as you don't double up on those bases, this will be a beautiful mix. Just please
[49:05.320 --> 49:09.720]  don't double up on that base mix. That will fry your plants. You will have a terrible
[49:09.720 --> 49:14.440]  experience and then you'll send me an angry email and I'll have to tell you, bro, I said
[49:14.440 --> 49:16.680]  don't double up on the base.
[49:16.680 --> 49:21.680]  So just a quick recap on that, and we will move into the large veg mix. You've got the
[49:21.680 --> 49:29.720]  options of a Veg Bloom base or a New Millennium base. That Veg Bloom base is simply 5 grams
[49:29.720 --> 49:36.520]  of your base mix per gallon of water. That's either RO, Dirty, Hard, HD, whichever one
[49:36.520 --> 49:43.620]  you select. 5 grams per gallon of water is your Veg Bloom base mix. To that, you will
[49:43.620 --> 49:50.600]  add 5 milliliters of Ruby, and you will also add 1 milliliter of Lightning Start. Your
[49:50.600 --> 49:59.640]  other option, if you go with the New Millennium base mix, is 3 milliliters of Equinox and
[49:59.640 --> 50:06.460]  9 milliliters of Summer Shift. To that, you will also add the 5 mils of Ruby and 1 mil
[50:06.460 --> 50:09.960]  of Lightning Start. Those are your two options for a base.
[50:09.960 --> 50:15.560]  Then I'll recap quickly our boosts. We want to use Plus Life, CalMag, Lightning Start,
[50:15.560 --> 50:23.080]  Epsom salts, then Skip a Day, and always adjust that to 6.1 to 6.4. All right, that's
[50:23.080 --> 50:29.600]  a quick recap on the small veg mix. That means it is time to work our way into the large
[50:29.600 --> 50:35.800]  vegetative feed mix. This is when we move our plants into three-gallon fabric pots.
[50:35.800 --> 50:43.120]  This is where we use that 70% cocoa, 20% perlite, and 15% persolite mix. We're going to keep
[50:43.120 --> 50:49.360]  these plants in these three-gallon pots until harvest time. In my facilities, they live
[50:49.360 --> 50:53.640]  to the end of their life in a three-gallon pot. They're going to veg in these pots for
[50:53.640 --> 50:58.120]  approximately three to four weeks, then they will flower in these pots for approximately
[50:58.120 --> 51:03.160]  eight to 10 weeks. In this lesson, we're going to focus on nine weeks, but let's talk about
[51:03.160 --> 51:07.240]  the veg mix for my large veg plants.
[51:07.400 --> 51:15.920]  Again, you've got the options of a Veg Bloom base mix or a New Millennium base mix. The
[51:15.920 --> 51:25.800]  Veg Bloom base mix is very simple. It is five grams of Veg Bloom base nutrient powder per
[51:25.800 --> 51:32.400]  gallon of water. Make sure you carefully weigh five grams per gallon of water. If you've
[51:32.400 --> 51:38.800]  got a 10-gallon reservoir, you're going to want to put 50 grams of Veg Bloom base mix
[51:38.800 --> 51:43.720]  into that water. You start with the five grams of Veg Bloom, then you're going to add to
[51:43.720 --> 51:50.640]  that five milliliters per gallon of water of Ruby. We are always going to use Ruby.
[51:50.640 --> 51:55.760]  Ruby is fulvic acid. Fulvic acid makes your nutrients more available to your plant. That
[51:55.760 --> 52:00.320]  is the simple way to put it. It is like adding an octane booster to your gas tank. We are
[52:00.320 --> 52:05.400]  paying a lot of money for all of these expensive nutrients. By adding a little bit of Ruby,
[52:05.400 --> 52:10.020]  you unlock more potential so your plants can absorb more of those nutrients. It's a little
[52:10.020 --> 52:16.760]  bit of a turbo charge or an octane booster. Let's always add five milliliters of Ruby
[52:16.760 --> 52:21.360]  per gallon of water just about every time we're mixing up nutrients.
[52:21.360 --> 52:26.720]  Let's stay focused. We are working on the Veg Bloom base mix for large veg plants. We
[52:26.720 --> 52:31.940]  have started with five grams of Veg Bloom base powder. We have added five milliliters
[52:31.940 --> 52:38.440]  of Ruby. Let's also add one milliliter of Lightning Star from New Millennium. That is
[52:38.440 --> 52:42.960]  one of your base nutrient options. If you're going with the Veg Bloom, you've got five
[52:42.960 --> 52:50.440]  grams of Veg Bloom powder, five milliliters of Ruby, and one milliliter of Lightning Star.
[52:50.440 --> 52:56.440]  Here is another option. Again, don't mix this with the Veg Bloom. You'll kill your
[52:56.440 --> 53:02.320]  plants and you'll be mad at me. Here is your other option if you want to use a New Millennium
[53:02.320 --> 53:12.240]  base mix. I recommend four milliliters of Equinox, two milliliters of Autumn Gold, and
[53:12.240 --> 53:20.680]  10 milliliters of Summer Shift per gallon of water. That's four Equinox, two Autumn
[53:20.680 --> 53:27.480]  Gold, and 10 Summer Shift. Then to that, we are going to add that standard five milliliters
[53:27.480 --> 53:32.720]  of Ruby. We want that fulvic acid in there. Then we are also going to add one milliliter
[53:32.720 --> 53:40.360]  of Lightning Star. Lightning Star is to help develop roots. Healthy roots make fast growing
[53:40.360 --> 53:44.400]  plants. We're always going to add the Ruby and the Lightning Star to our veg mixes just
[53:44.400 --> 53:52.720]  to give them a little turbo charge. Those are your two options for large veg base mixes.
[53:52.720 --> 53:58.640]  Then we are going to work in our boosts. Again, if you want to mix all of this up on Monday,
[53:58.640 --> 54:03.280]  you can do this as a Monday mix. If you want to do this as a boost throughout the week,
[54:03.280 --> 54:08.160]  this is how I would suggest it. I like to start the week off with that plus life. On
[54:08.160 --> 54:14.820]  day one, we are going to add a half a gram of plus life per gallon of water, one half
[54:14.820 --> 54:21.080]  of a gram per gallon. Then on day two, we're going to go with CalMag. Again, I can't make
[54:21.080 --> 54:25.880]  a recommendation on how much CalMag you add to your plants because I don't know which
[54:25.880 --> 54:31.680]  brand of CalMag you have purchased. If you have got the GH brand of CaliMagic, you can
[54:31.680 --> 54:39.000]  probably use one to two milliliters per gallon and your plants will be happy. Then the next
[54:39.000 --> 54:45.600]  day I would recommend we use five milliliters of Lightning Star. Add that to the one milliliter
[54:45.600 --> 54:50.400]  that you're already using because this is a separate boost. We are adding this to give
[54:50.400 --> 54:56.240]  a little more root development and make the plants go a little faster. Then our next boost
[54:56.320 --> 55:04.080]  is going to be Epsom salts, one gram of Epsom salts per gallon of water on day four. Then
[55:04.080 --> 55:09.400]  on day five, we are not going to add a boost. Then we are going to go right back to the
[55:09.400 --> 55:16.480]  start with our half gram of plus life and repeat the list. Again, it is plus life, CalMag,
[55:16.480 --> 55:22.640]  Lightning Start, Epsom salts, and just repeat that cycle until these plants go into flower.
[55:22.960 --> 55:28.960]  For my large veg mix, I will recommend that we do adjust the pH to somewhere between 6.1
[55:28.960 --> 55:34.800]  and 6.4. Of course, make sure you are getting plenty of runoff when you are watering these
[55:34.800 --> 55:40.800]  plants. I feel like we are making great progress on the mix episode here. We have talked about
[55:40.800 --> 55:44.560]  what to feed our clones. We have talked about what to feed our small veg. I feel like we've
[55:44.560 --> 55:49.520]  got a solid idea of what to feed our large veg plants. I've got one more thing I feel like I
[55:49.520 --> 55:55.360]  should make sure to cover. At this stage of the game, it is really important to have a solid
[55:55.360 --> 56:01.760]  integrated pest management strategy in place. We need to make sure not to get bugs. It is almost
[56:01.760 --> 56:06.880]  time to put our plants into flower. I really don't like putting plants into flower if there is a pest
[56:06.880 --> 56:12.000]  problem. I'll do my best to eradicate that problem before we go into bloom because once you are in
[56:12.000 --> 56:18.080]  bloom, you are very limited on your options for getting rid of bugs. So make sure you are working
[56:18.080 --> 56:24.000]  on some sort of integrated pest management strategy, multiple modes of attack, multiple
[56:24.000 --> 56:28.640]  methods, pay good attention, have a lot of indicators in there. That is a whole another
[56:28.640 --> 56:36.560]  episode. What I wanted to make sure to add into that part was when I apply a sprayed on pesticide,
[56:36.560 --> 56:43.920]  I always mix in a product called Push. Push is from VegBloom. They do recommend that you don't
[56:43.920 --> 56:50.320]  mix Push with other products, but if I am applying a pesticide, I always add the recommended dosage
[56:50.320 --> 56:56.000]  of Push to that pesticide. It is a foliar feed. I feel like if I'm going to put something shitty
[56:56.000 --> 57:00.880]  on the plants, it may compromise their health, but I can offset some of that damage by adding
[57:00.880 --> 57:07.120]  something healthy. I think that good, healthy product is Push. So every time I apply a pesticide,
[57:07.120 --> 57:12.240]  I mix a little bit of Push in the mix and spray that onto the plants as recommended.
[57:12.240 --> 57:17.680]  I also like to use Push once a week with or without a pesticide. If I'm not applying a
[57:17.680 --> 57:24.320]  pesticide, I will mix up the recommended dosage of Push. I do believe it's 50 milliliters per gallon,
[57:24.320 --> 57:28.320]  shake the shit out of it, and apply that to the plants when the lights are off.
[57:28.320 --> 57:34.880]  And I feel like I can see the growth that comes from using Push. So Push is another product I like
[57:34.880 --> 57:40.800]  to use throughout the entire veg phase, right up to the time I start seeing bud sites develop.
[57:40.800 --> 57:46.480]  Push is a great product, and I think I can actually see the results from using it.
[57:46.480 --> 57:53.520]  So something you can add is Push about once a week at 50 mils per gallon, applied as a foliar feed,
[57:53.520 --> 57:59.600]  and also add it every time you apply a sprayed on pesticide. All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[57:59.600 --> 58:06.080]  boys and girls, smokers and growers, I think that concludes my first mix episode. I really hope you
[58:06.080 --> 58:10.880]  learned a lot. I hope you enjoyed that. I had a lot of fun teaching you about what I feed my
[58:10.880 --> 58:17.440]  plants. In the next episode, we will work our way into my flowering nutrient mixes. I've got a lot
[58:17.440 --> 58:22.880]  of great things to share with you. Please stick around for that one. If you feel like this episode
