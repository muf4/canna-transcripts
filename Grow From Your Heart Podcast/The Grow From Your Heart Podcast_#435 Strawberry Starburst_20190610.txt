[00:00.000 --> 00:02.080]  Welcome back, Podcast World!
[00:02.080 --> 00:06.380]  It is time for Episode 435 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:06.380 --> 00:09.400]  This episode of the show is brought to you by Seeds Here Now.
[00:09.400 --> 00:13.920]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Seeds Here Now, and you can find
[00:13.920 --> 00:19.720]  them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:19.720 --> 00:23.680]  It has become a tradition that we start the podcast off by talking about what I'm dabbing.
[00:23.680 --> 00:28.960]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Garlic Grove Full Spectrum Extract from Green Dot Labs.
[00:28.960 --> 00:30.120]  This stuff is delicious.
[00:30.120 --> 00:33.840]  It is a blend of GMO cookies and LOAF2.
[00:33.840 --> 00:37.160]  The label says the flavor should taste like orange soda and garlic.
[00:37.160 --> 00:39.360]  I find that to be pretty accurate.
[00:39.360 --> 00:43.200]  It kind of tastes like I took a bite of garlicky mashed potatoes, and then I washed it down
[00:43.200 --> 00:44.920]  with a kiwi strawberry snapple.
[00:44.920 --> 00:47.900]  It's a really delicious flavor, a really complex flavor.
[00:47.900 --> 00:52.560]  That strawberry, maybe an orange soda flavor kind of lingers on my tongue for quite a while,
[00:52.560 --> 00:54.000]  and then the buzz is perfect.
[00:54.000 --> 00:55.840]  It goes right to my eyes, right to my face.
[00:55.840 --> 00:57.600]  I really enjoy it.
[00:57.600 --> 01:01.600]  So today, I'm dabbing the Garlic Grove Full Spectrum Extract from our friends at Green
[01:01.600 --> 01:02.600]  Dot Labs.
[01:02.600 --> 01:05.100]  Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot.

[01:56.840 --> 02:00.800]  At the start of the show, I said we were going to talk about one of my new favorite strains.
[02:00.800 --> 02:06.060]  In this episode, I'm going to do a strain review on Strawberry Starburst.
[02:06.060 --> 02:10.960]  Just to catch everybody up before we talk about my strains, I am Rasta Jeff from iRegenetics.
[02:10.960 --> 02:14.880]  I am the breeder and sole proprietor of iRegenetics Colorado.
[02:14.880 --> 02:18.340]  I create high quality regular and feminized seeds.
[02:18.340 --> 02:24.000]  My most popular regular seed line has become the Arise, and my most popular feminized seed
[02:24.000 --> 02:27.520]  line so far has become the Lemon Jeffrey.
[02:27.520 --> 02:32.000]  In this episode, we're going to focus on one of my favorite creations, and that is my Strawberry
[02:32.000 --> 02:33.400]  Starburst.
[02:33.400 --> 02:35.480]  What is Strawberry Starburst?
[02:35.480 --> 02:40.520]  Strawberry Starburst is a cross of a female Strawberry Fields from Crockett Farms, crossed
[02:40.520 --> 02:44.200]  to a male Arise from iRegenetics.
[02:44.200 --> 02:47.560]  Let's talk about that Strawberry Fields from Crockett.
[02:47.560 --> 02:50.440]  Strawberry Fields is a cross of Strawberry Banana.
[02:50.440 --> 02:54.240]  You've got that tropical, sweet, Strawberry Banana sort of a flavor.
[02:54.240 --> 02:56.640]  Then it was pollinated by a male Tangy.
[02:56.640 --> 03:00.600]  That male Tangy gave it a really citrusy, orangey kind of a flavor.
[03:00.600 --> 03:06.440]  When it came out, it's sort of like a Strawberry Banana Orange Julius is the best way to describe
[03:06.440 --> 03:08.040]  that Strawberry Fields.
[03:08.040 --> 03:11.600]  It depends on how it is grown and where it is grown, but sometimes it'll get a really
[03:11.600 --> 03:14.920]  strong Strawberry Candy sort of aroma.
[03:14.920 --> 03:17.320]  Sometimes it gets more of that orange creamy kind of aroma.
[03:17.320 --> 03:20.340]  It just depends on the grower, the environment, and the nutrients.
[03:20.340 --> 03:24.580]  But in my opinion, it tastes very much like an Orange Julius, maybe with a hint of Banana
[03:24.580 --> 03:29.420]  in there, and it definitely has a lot of Strawberry Candy dominating the flavor.
[03:29.420 --> 03:33.500]  I really love the aroma and flavors that come from this Strawberry Fields plant.
[03:33.500 --> 03:36.620]  That is part of what inspired me to breed it to my Arise.
[03:36.620 --> 03:41.300]  The next thing that inspired me to breed it to my Arise was the size of the buds.
[03:41.300 --> 03:44.220]  This plant already made monster colas.
[03:44.220 --> 03:46.860]  I found Strawberry Fields in a commercial facility.
[03:46.860 --> 03:48.420]  I took over running a grow.
[03:48.420 --> 03:50.380]  They already had the Strawberry Fields in there.
[03:50.380 --> 03:54.140]  I knew that every time I ran that plant, I would hit my harvest weights and I would get
[03:54.140 --> 03:58.100]  bonuses because it puts out huge, giant colas.
[03:58.100 --> 03:59.980]  So that was a good reason to breed to it.
[03:59.980 --> 04:03.640]  The only thing it was missing was super potency.
[04:03.640 --> 04:05.000]  It had hyper vigor.
[04:05.000 --> 04:06.760]  It produced gigantic buds.
[04:06.760 --> 04:11.800]  It has amazing flavors and aromas, but the finished product always lacked a little bit
[04:11.800 --> 04:12.800]  of potency.
[04:12.800 --> 04:16.620]  I felt like everything else in the garden was hitting a little bit harder with lab tests.
[04:16.620 --> 04:18.940]  In today's market, the lab tests mean a lot.
[04:18.940 --> 04:23.380]  I just could not get that Strawberry Fields to hit the test that everything else was hitting.
[04:23.380 --> 04:28.400]  I knew that by pollinating that strawberry with Arise, I could increase that hyper vigor.
[04:28.400 --> 04:31.540]  I could potentially increase that giant bud potential.
[04:31.540 --> 04:35.500]  I knew that I would increase the potency because that is one thing that my Arise male does
[04:35.500 --> 04:37.260]  to everything it pollinates.
[04:37.260 --> 04:39.160]  It increases potency.
[04:39.160 --> 04:43.700]  That is a good way to segue into talking about my male Arise plant, who is known as King
[04:43.700 --> 04:44.700]  Solomon.
[04:44.700 --> 04:46.940]  I want to talk briefly about Arise.
[04:46.940 --> 04:52.140]  Arise is a cross of a Golden Goat female pollinated by a Daybreaker male.
[04:52.140 --> 04:56.780]  Daybreaker is from Gage Green Genetics, and it is a cross of ChemD and Joseph OG.
[04:56.780 --> 05:00.040]  So it's got a lot of gassy, funky, wonderful aromas.
[05:00.040 --> 05:03.700]  The phenotype I used had really large, really wide leaves.
[05:03.700 --> 05:06.180]  The growth structure was perfect for my project.
[05:06.180 --> 05:10.800]  So I used the male Daybreaker and I pollinated the female Golden Goat to create the Arise.
[05:10.800 --> 05:12.700]  I've done a full episode on Arise.
[05:12.700 --> 05:16.500]  If you'd like to listen to that episode, it is number 329.
[05:16.500 --> 05:20.700]  Episode 329 is available on iTunes, Stitcher, and YouTube.
[05:20.700 --> 05:26.000]  It is also available in a playlist titled Strain Descriptions on my YouTube channel.
[05:26.000 --> 05:30.280]  If you go to the Grow From Your Heart Podcast YouTube channel, look for the playlist titled
[05:30.280 --> 05:35.260]  Strain Descriptions, you will find a long list of strain description episodes.
[05:35.260 --> 05:39.620]  If you like the strain descriptions, I saved them all for you right there in one playlist.
[05:39.620 --> 05:43.220]  Give them a listen and please leave some comments and let me know what you think.
[05:43.220 --> 05:47.240]  Now let's focus on this episode about Strawberry Starburst.
[05:47.240 --> 05:52.420]  One of the first things you will notice about Strawberry Starburst are the aromas and flavors.
[05:52.420 --> 05:54.340]  These buds smell amazing.
[05:54.340 --> 05:58.340]  I'm sure that by telling you about that Strawberry Fields mother plant, you've probably got a
[05:58.340 --> 06:02.260]  pretty good idea of what the Strawberry Starburst will taste and smell like.
[06:02.260 --> 06:07.180]  It has got that strawberry candy sort of a thing going on, but then it has a funky undertone
[06:07.180 --> 06:08.180]  to it.
[06:08.180 --> 06:10.220]  It's got something that is really funky.
[06:10.220 --> 06:12.420]  It is delicious and strawberry candy-like.
[06:12.420 --> 06:17.140]  It carries that tropical flavor, but then it's just got a dirty foot in the bag.
[06:17.140 --> 06:20.500]  It's like you've got, maybe you've got like a whole bag of strawberries and then maybe
[06:20.500 --> 06:24.340]  you've got some watermelon slices in there and maybe there's a couple of kiwi in there,
[06:24.340 --> 06:26.140]  but also it's like you've got a foot in there.
[06:26.140 --> 06:29.660]  Maybe not a whole foot, but maybe like a couple of really ripe toes.
[06:29.660 --> 06:34.180]  So it's got strawberry dominates, there's some watermelon, maybe a hint of kiwi in there,
[06:34.180 --> 06:37.000]  but then definitely a couple of dirty toes.
[06:37.000 --> 06:40.720]  Maybe not an entire Wookie foot, but there are a couple of toes that are questionable
[06:40.720 --> 06:41.920]  and they're just stinking it up.
[06:41.920 --> 06:43.460]  So that is the aroma.
[06:43.460 --> 06:44.460]  That's the flavor.
[06:44.460 --> 06:45.680]  It is strawberry dominant.
[06:45.680 --> 06:49.800]  It still brings that orange Julius creamy sort of a thing, but it is mostly strawberry.
[06:49.800 --> 06:51.440]  It's got some watermelon to it.
[06:51.440 --> 06:55.080]  And then like I keep saying, there is a hint of dirty, funky feet.
[06:55.080 --> 06:56.440]  And that is something I really enjoy.
[06:56.440 --> 07:01.760]  I like that skunky rank smell at the end when you inhale and it's nice and sweet and then
[07:01.760 --> 07:03.640]  you blow it out and it's disgusting.
[07:03.640 --> 07:05.380]  That's my favorite kind of aroma.
[07:05.380 --> 07:07.460]  So that's what it tastes and smells like.
[07:07.460 --> 07:11.740]  When it's growing, it's got more of a fresh, ripe strawberry like the fruit, but as it
[07:11.740 --> 07:15.340]  gets riper, it starts to develop that strawberry candy.
[07:15.340 --> 07:18.620]  Then throughout the drying and curing process, you really start to bring out that strawberry
[07:18.620 --> 07:20.140]  candy aroma.
[07:20.140 --> 07:22.700]  Sometimes more watermelon aroma will come out.
[07:22.700 --> 07:26.140]  Sometimes more of that orange Julius creamy sort of thing will come out, but it does make
[07:26.140 --> 07:29.300]  some delicious fruity flavors.
[07:29.300 --> 07:32.140]  Now let's talk a little bit about her growth structure.
[07:32.140 --> 07:35.980]  The growth structure of strawberry fields is very predictable since it came from the
[07:35.980 --> 07:38.220]  Arise male and the strawberry fields female.
[07:38.220 --> 07:41.500]  I know it is going to get fairly tall.
[07:41.500 --> 07:45.300]  Most of the phenotypes grow quite tall, so flower a little bit early.
[07:45.300 --> 07:49.140]  You will also notice they are quite vigorous early in veg.
[07:49.140 --> 07:50.660]  These plants take off.
[07:50.660 --> 07:53.460]  These plants grow with what I call hyper vigor.
[07:53.460 --> 07:56.820]  These plants are going to get larger than all of your other plants that are growing
[07:56.820 --> 07:58.180]  in the same conditions.
[07:58.180 --> 07:59.740]  So be prepared for that.
[07:59.740 --> 08:03.900]  These plants are going to get tall and they are going to make a lot of long branches.
[08:03.900 --> 08:07.540]  There won't be a lot of space between the branches, so you'll have a nice tight inner
[08:07.540 --> 08:08.860]  node space.
[08:08.860 --> 08:12.820]  Something you may notice, that when the branches do start to grow out, they will have distance
[08:12.820 --> 08:15.900]  between where the bud sites look like they're going to be.
[08:15.900 --> 08:20.780]  That is okay because the buds grow so large that they will fill in all of those gaps.
[08:20.780 --> 08:25.140]  So if it looks like you've got a lot of space between bud sites, expect that to fill in
[08:25.140 --> 08:26.460]  by the end of flower.
[08:26.460 --> 08:31.180]  That plant is just giving itself some space and some room to make monster colas.
[08:31.180 --> 08:35.500]  If you crowd Strawberry Starburst in too tight, it will get frustrated and it will grow tall
[08:35.500 --> 08:38.420]  and skinny and it won't branch out the way that it should.
[08:38.420 --> 08:39.900]  And then it will get really stretchy.
[08:39.900 --> 08:41.940]  So I recommend giving it plenty of space.
[08:41.940 --> 08:46.740]  If you crowd it in, it is not going to benefit you by doing too many plants per square foot.
[08:46.740 --> 08:50.320]  This one needs some breathing room and some stretching out space.
[08:50.320 --> 08:54.000]  Strawberry Starburst will get tall and it will have a lot of long branches.
[08:54.040 --> 08:57.860]  She can become unruly if you don't give her some sort of training.
[08:57.860 --> 09:03.760]  She responds very well to any type of LST, any type of super cropping, any type of twisting,
[09:03.760 --> 09:05.120]  any type of trellising.
[09:05.120 --> 09:08.840]  She likes that sort of stuff and it just makes her grow faster.
[09:08.840 --> 09:13.400]  I really suggest doing a lot of popping and twisting of the branches for the first three
[09:13.400 --> 09:18.720]  weeks of flower because that will really help slow down your 21 day stretch.
[09:18.720 --> 09:23.320]  Strawberry Starburst does respond well to being topped, but if you do not top her, she
[09:23.320 --> 09:26.600]  will make a monstrous top cola.
[09:26.600 --> 09:31.200]  If you're looking for one of those gigantic buds to take great photos of, Strawberry Starburst
[09:31.200 --> 09:34.040]  will give you amazing photogenic buds.
[09:34.040 --> 09:37.880]  Now if you do decide to top your Strawberry Starburst plant and spread it out a little
[09:37.880 --> 09:43.000]  bit, give it plenty of time to recover from that topping and you will get a lot of monstrous
[09:43.000 --> 09:45.720]  size buds from your Screen of Green setup.
[09:45.720 --> 09:48.400]  Just give it plenty of time to recover from the topping.
[09:48.400 --> 09:52.200]  Earlier I said that it does make long branches with a little bit of space between the bud
[09:52.200 --> 09:53.200]  sides.
[09:53.280 --> 09:57.080]  If you spread those branches out and give each of those bud sides some space to grow,
[09:57.080 --> 10:01.320]  you will get a good size bud on each of those spaces just depending on your setup, your
[10:01.320 --> 10:03.800]  environment and mainly your lighting and nutrients.
[10:03.800 --> 10:08.000]  But if you spread it out properly, this plant will give you huge production.
[10:08.000 --> 10:11.960]  So she's going to get big and she's going to grow very quickly, but if you train her
[10:11.960 --> 10:15.800]  and take good care of her, she will be a very productive plant for you.
[10:15.800 --> 10:19.360]  If you're not going to put it in some sort of a screen, I definitely recommend giving
[10:19.360 --> 10:23.080]  it some sort of sticks, some sort of stakes, some sort of tomato cages.
[10:23.080 --> 10:26.760]  It will need something to support the buds because they are going to get really long
[10:26.760 --> 10:29.360]  and really floppy early in flower.
[10:29.360 --> 10:32.440]  Most of the time you're going to need supports around week five or six.
[10:32.440 --> 10:36.240]  I would definitely say have them in there by the end of week four.
[10:36.240 --> 10:39.240]  Strawberry Starburst does react well to defoliating.
[10:39.240 --> 10:43.640]  If you like to do a moderate defoliation, you can do so with Strawberry Starburst.
[10:43.640 --> 10:44.940]  Don't go too hard.
[10:44.940 --> 10:51.100]  She does not like being stripped, but she does like being moderately heavily defoliated.
[10:51.100 --> 10:52.100]  Don't go extreme.
[10:52.100 --> 10:53.100]  I don't know how hard you go.
[10:53.100 --> 10:55.980]  In a commercial environment, we can go a little bit hard.
[10:55.980 --> 10:59.260]  Don't strip Strawberry Starburst down until she's naked.
[10:59.260 --> 11:00.820]  She needs a few leaves.
[11:00.820 --> 11:02.480]  She's got those skinny long leaves.
[11:02.480 --> 11:06.220]  She needs a few of those to keep her photosynthesis going to keep herself happy.
[11:06.220 --> 11:08.100]  So don't strip her too naked.
[11:08.100 --> 11:12.500]  Now let's talk a little bit about nutrients and feeding Strawberry Starburst.
[11:12.540 --> 11:17.700]  When most grows, I am using New Millennium Bottled Nutrients, Veg Bloom Powdered Nutrients,
[11:17.700 --> 11:19.620]  or a combination of the two.
[11:19.620 --> 11:24.460]  I have seen Strawberry Starburst thrive with both of those setups.
[11:24.460 --> 11:30.280]  Also, some of the best Strawberry Starburst I have ever smelled or smoked was grown in
[11:30.280 --> 11:33.940]  a no-till bed that has been running for four years.
[11:33.940 --> 11:38.580]  So Strawberry Starburst seems to like all types of nutrient setups, all types of feed
[11:38.580 --> 11:39.580]  environments.
[11:39.580 --> 11:42.500]  It is running in a commercial environment right now and it is crushing it with New
[11:42.500 --> 11:44.500]  Millennium and Veg Bloom.
[11:44.500 --> 11:48.220]  It's also in a no-till garden right now with a Clackamas Coot Mix that has been going for
[11:48.220 --> 11:50.980]  four years and it is crushing it in there.
[11:50.980 --> 11:53.620]  So it seems to really enjoy all types of nutrients.
[11:53.620 --> 11:57.900]  One thing I can tell you, it is a heavy feeder.
[11:57.900 --> 12:01.820]  Strawberry Starburst will grow quickly in veg and when you flip it into flour, it is
[12:01.820 --> 12:03.900]  going to take off.
[12:03.900 --> 12:09.460]  Strawberry Starburst plants receive 90% of their nitrogen during their veg cycle.
[12:09.460 --> 12:15.700]  So before you flip these plants to flour, make sure you are not nitrogen deficient in
[12:15.700 --> 12:16.900]  any way.
[12:16.900 --> 12:21.460]  If your leaves are yellowing, if your growth is slowing, you may be nitrogen deficient
[12:21.460 --> 12:25.020]  and you don't want to go into flour chasing that nitrogen.
[12:25.020 --> 12:27.740]  So pay attention to your leaves, pay attention to your growth.
[12:27.740 --> 12:32.940]  If you see slow growth or yellowing leaves, you are probably macronutrient deficient and
[12:32.980 --> 12:37.740]  you need to feed some base nutrients, maybe some cow mag and boost up those macronutrients
[12:37.740 --> 12:39.140]  before you go into flour.
[12:39.140 --> 12:42.380]  You don't want to go into flour if you are already deficient.
[12:42.380 --> 12:44.820]  Alright now let's talk about flowering time.
[12:44.820 --> 12:48.900]  I suggest flipping these plants into flour early because they are going to grow very
[12:48.900 --> 12:54.060]  quickly in veg and they are going to take off as soon as you put them into bloom.
[12:54.060 --> 13:00.220]  Most phenotypes of Strawberry Starburst will typically finish flowering in 9-10 weeks.
[13:00.220 --> 13:04.100]  There will be a couple of outliers that will finish a little earlier and there is a phenotype
[13:04.100 --> 13:09.020]  that does take a little bit longer, but typically 9-10 weeks is the harvest window for most
[13:09.020 --> 13:10.020]  phenotypes.
[13:10.020 --> 13:14.620]  And I think that is a great way to segue into talking about common phenotypes of Strawberry
[13:14.620 --> 13:16.460]  Starburst.
[13:16.460 --> 13:21.460]  Strawberry Starburst is an F1 hybrid so there definitely will be variation.
[13:21.460 --> 13:24.100]  Variation is expected in an F1 hybrid.
[13:24.100 --> 13:28.100]  We are going to see phenotypes that very closely represent the Arise.
[13:28.100 --> 13:36.340]  We are going to see phenotypes that are perfect 50-50 combos.
[13:36.340 --> 13:43.340]  And we should see some phenotypes that look 75% Strawberry Fields, 25% Arise, and then
[13:43.340 --> 13:49.020]  you will find the opposite 75% Arise, 25% Strawberry Fields.
[13:49.020 --> 13:52.600]  Those are the phenotypes we typically find in this F1 cross.
[13:52.600 --> 13:57.440]  So within that variation there are a couple of very recognizable phenotypes.
[13:57.780 --> 14:02.420]  My favorite is the one that I call the spongy or the jagged phenotype.
[14:02.420 --> 14:04.400]  It sort of looks like a loofah sponge.
[14:04.400 --> 14:07.100]  It does not have a really pretty bud structure.
[14:07.100 --> 14:10.880]  The buds are gigantic, but they are shaped kind of oddly.
[14:10.880 --> 14:14.640]  That one has an amazing strawberry aroma to it.
[14:14.640 --> 14:17.040]  That one makes the best concentrate.
[14:17.040 --> 14:19.200]  We're going to talk about that here in a little bit.
[14:19.200 --> 14:22.640]  But that Strawberry Starburst phenotype that isn't super tight, the one that starts to
[14:22.640 --> 14:26.960]  fluff out a little bit later in flower, that one is going to make amazing concentrate.
[14:26.980 --> 14:31.160]  So if you're a concentrate maker, that is a plant to be on the search for.
[14:31.160 --> 14:35.840]  There is another phenotype that comes from Strawberry Starburst that is very easily identifiable.
[14:35.840 --> 14:37.840]  I call it the 50-50.
[14:37.840 --> 14:42.120]  It's a beautiful 50-50 combination of the Strawberry Fields and the Arise.
[14:42.120 --> 14:45.520]  It brings that gassy, cushy aroma from the Daybreaker.
[14:45.520 --> 14:50.100]  And then it also brings that sweet strawberry cream flavor from the Strawberry Banana.
[14:50.100 --> 14:53.160]  So it's got a gassy, creamy, strawberry sort of aroma.
[14:53.160 --> 14:57.240]  And then the growth, it grows more like Arise because it stays a little bit shorter and
[14:57.240 --> 14:58.640]  a little bit more stout.
[14:58.640 --> 15:02.960]  But that top bud gets real big and real jagged and has a real mean look to it.
[15:02.960 --> 15:04.960]  That one I call the 50-50.
[15:04.960 --> 15:08.760]  Now there is another very common phenotype that comes from the Strawberry Starburst,
[15:08.760 --> 15:09.760]  and it is my favorite.
[15:09.760 --> 15:11.860]  I just call it my favorite phenotype.
[15:11.860 --> 15:16.680]  This one looks more like Arise, but it smells just like strawberries.
[15:16.680 --> 15:18.080]  It's got the shorter growth.
[15:18.080 --> 15:19.240]  It's a little bit branchier.
[15:19.240 --> 15:20.680]  It's a little bit tighter in space.
[15:20.680 --> 15:25.120]  The leaves are a little bit larger, a little bit broader, but these phenotypes taste just
[15:25.120 --> 15:26.120]  like strawberry.
[15:26.120 --> 15:28.120]  And it's not real fruit strawberries.
[15:28.120 --> 15:30.400]  It's more like that strawberry candy.
[15:30.400 --> 15:35.400]  There's a strawberry candy that comes wrapped in a foil with a strawberry print on the packaging.
[15:35.400 --> 15:40.560]  And I think that this phenotype of Strawberry Starburst tastes just like those strawberry
[15:40.560 --> 15:41.560]  candies.
[15:41.560 --> 15:44.920]  A lot of the other phenotypes have more of a real strawberry.
[15:44.920 --> 15:49.480]  They taste like the fruit, or maybe some of them actually taste like a Strawberry Starburst.
[15:49.480 --> 15:53.080]  But I think these phenotypes of Strawberry Starburst taste more like that strawberry
[15:53.080 --> 15:54.440]  hard candy.
[15:54.440 --> 15:59.360]  So a second ago, I said that Strawberry Starburst makes some of the best concentrates.
[15:59.360 --> 16:03.880]  My friend Kelvin grew Strawberry Starburst, and my friend Pedro from Pedro's Grow Room
[16:03.880 --> 16:05.160]  pressed it.
[16:05.160 --> 16:06.880]  And I am not a fan of rosin.
[16:06.880 --> 16:10.600]  If you've listened to this podcast regularly, you've heard me say, I don't like to smoke
[16:10.600 --> 16:12.080]  rosin.
[16:12.080 --> 16:16.480]  When Kelvin grew that Strawberry Starburst and brought it to my house, I smelled it and
[16:16.480 --> 16:17.800]  said, that is amazing.
[16:17.800 --> 16:18.800]  That is delicious.
[16:19.120 --> 16:20.120]  I want to smoke some of that.
[16:20.120 --> 16:21.120]  We smoked it.
[16:21.120 --> 16:22.120]  It was great.
[16:22.120 --> 16:26.520]  We took that flower up to Denver and we had Pedro press it at the Dude Grows Cup.
[16:26.520 --> 16:29.040]  And that concentrate was delicious.
[16:29.040 --> 16:34.440]  That was the best rosin I have ever smoked that was pressed from a flower.
[16:34.440 --> 16:38.000]  It tasted like a strawberry fruit roll-up.
[16:38.000 --> 16:43.320]  So the Strawberry Starburst rosin changed my complete opinion on smoking rosin.
[16:43.320 --> 16:48.080]  I'm not a big fan of rosin still, but if you've got Strawberry Starburst rosin, I would definitely
[16:48.160 --> 16:53.160]  take a big old fat dab and then I would probably take another one in just a couple minutes.
[16:53.160 --> 16:55.920]  So those are the basics of Strawberry Starburst.
[16:55.920 --> 16:59.000]  Let's work into some of the finer details.
[16:59.000 --> 17:02.920]  Most phenotypes, like I mentioned earlier, will be heavy feeders.
[17:02.920 --> 17:07.480]  Don't let your plants get macronutrient before you go into flower and pay attention in early
[17:07.480 --> 17:11.440]  flower that you are not getting macronutrient deficiencies.
[17:11.440 --> 17:16.200]  Also you are going to get gigantic buds if you grow these plants properly.
[17:16.200 --> 17:17.200]  Be prepared.
[17:17.320 --> 17:20.120]  These plants are going to topple over if you don't have some way to support them.
[17:20.120 --> 17:24.240]  I also suggest plenty of airflow and dehumidification.
[17:24.240 --> 17:28.760]  When you get giant buds, you do give yourself potential for giant problems.
[17:28.760 --> 17:33.160]  Also Strawberry Starburst plants do take a little longer than some plants.
[17:33.160 --> 17:34.960]  Like I said earlier, nine to 10 weeks.
[17:34.960 --> 17:37.420]  A lot of people like to cut down at week nine.
[17:37.420 --> 17:39.920]  Some of these phenotypes may need that extra week.
[17:39.920 --> 17:40.920]  Use your scope.
[17:40.920 --> 17:42.240]  Pay attention to the trichomes.
[17:42.240 --> 17:44.640]  Take no plant before it's time.
[17:44.640 --> 17:47.400]  Also these plants are very vigorous.
[17:47.400 --> 17:49.280]  Be prepared for rapid growth.
[17:49.280 --> 17:50.860]  You may need to flower earlier.
[17:50.860 --> 17:52.200]  You may need some sort of supports.
[17:52.200 --> 17:53.520]  You may need some trellis.
[17:53.520 --> 17:57.680]  You will need supports for your buds earlier than you were used to.
[17:57.680 --> 18:02.120]  Another great thing about Strawberry Starburst is she seems to be very easy to clone.
[18:02.120 --> 18:06.140]  I can make her clone very well and all of my other friends who have given me grow reports
[18:06.140 --> 18:09.240]  say that she clones very easily.
[18:09.240 --> 18:15.380]  Another note that I wrote down was low pH for color and low temp for color.
[18:15.380 --> 18:18.720]  Later in bloom if you really want to bring out some great colors, if you want to bring
[18:18.720 --> 18:23.980]  out some purples, maybe some pinks, some gold and red type hues, lower the pH and lower
[18:23.980 --> 18:29.320]  the temperatures later in flower and you will absolutely bring out some magnificently beautiful
[18:29.320 --> 18:32.100]  colors for the Strawberry Starburst.
[18:32.100 --> 18:36.160]  Also I've said this earlier, don't cut her down too early.
[18:36.160 --> 18:40.040]  Strawberry Starburst likes to chunk out on the last week or two.
[18:40.040 --> 18:44.720]  So if you cut down too early, you may rip yourself off for a little bit of weight.
[18:44.720 --> 18:47.400]  These plants like to bulk up right at the very end.
[18:47.400 --> 18:49.440]  So don't cut them down too early.
[18:49.440 --> 18:51.480]  Make sure you're paying attention to your trichomes.
[18:51.480 --> 18:55.080]  As soon as you start seeing some amber trichomes, you need to start considering your harvest
[18:55.080 --> 18:56.080]  day.
[18:56.080 --> 19:01.480]  But do not cut down too early because like I said, they're going to bulk up late in flower.
[19:01.480 --> 19:06.400]  Strawberry Starburst plants do create a lot of aroma, but fortunately most of it is kind
[19:06.400 --> 19:09.560]  of a sweeter, candier, creamier sort of aroma.
[19:09.560 --> 19:15.200]  So odor control is still important, but you're not going to have that gassy skunky funk blasting
[19:15.200 --> 19:16.240]  out of the grow space.
[19:16.240 --> 19:21.660]  So if you need something that isn't skunky and isn't real chem doggy and real OG cushy,
[19:21.660 --> 19:24.960]  maybe something that can blend in a little better, maybe for growing by a strawberry
[19:24.960 --> 19:28.480]  field or maybe you're growing by an orange orchard, or maybe if you've got lilacs or
[19:28.480 --> 19:33.240]  lilies or something that puts off a sweet smell near you, maybe strawberry Starburst
[19:33.240 --> 19:37.000]  plants could blend right in and not get you so much attention.
[19:37.000 --> 19:38.000]  All right, podcast world.
[19:38.000 --> 19:40.520]  I think that is all I've got for you for strawberry Starburst.
