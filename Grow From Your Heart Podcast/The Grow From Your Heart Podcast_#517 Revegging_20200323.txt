[00:48.320 --> 00:52.140]  You know I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm dabbing.
[00:52.140 --> 00:57.100]  This evening, I've been taking dabs of Cowboy Kush Full Spectrum Extract from our friends
[00:57.100 --> 00:58.860]  at Green Dot Labs.
[00:58.860 --> 01:02.140]  This is a blend of HAOG and Stardog.
[01:02.140 --> 01:06.180]  On the package, the flavor is described as earthy, fuel, and leather.
[01:06.180 --> 01:07.980]  I'm going to agree with the earthy.
[01:07.980 --> 01:09.580]  The fuel is certainly there.
[01:09.580 --> 01:11.100]  There may be some leather.
[01:11.100 --> 01:15.980]  One thing I am noticing, if I smell this jar and I pull it away from my face quickly, I
[01:15.980 --> 01:19.580]  do get a hint of strawberries or watermelons.
[01:19.580 --> 01:22.780]  I believe that is coming from the Stardog.
[01:22.780 --> 01:27.100]  If you let the Stardog flower for just a little bit too long, it will produce a little bit
[01:27.100 --> 01:28.580]  of a berry flavor.
[01:28.580 --> 01:33.800]  I really think that this product represents that strawberry-watermelon sort of flavor
[01:33.800 --> 01:35.020]  and aroma.
[01:35.020 --> 01:36.340]  I really enjoy it.
[01:36.340 --> 01:37.940]  Of course, I like the buzz.
[01:37.940 --> 01:42.060]  The most impressive part about this package, it is a 4-gram container.
[01:42.060 --> 01:47.180]  When I cracked open the jar, it is just one giant diamond in the middle of the jar with
[01:47.540 --> 01:50.380]  enough terp sauce around it to make it delicious.
[01:50.380 --> 01:54.060]  I was really impressed with the appearance of this product.
[01:54.060 --> 01:55.820]  Of course, I love the aroma.
[01:55.820 --> 02:01.060]  I'm sure you can tell by how chatty I am that I completely love the buzz of the Cowboy Kush
[02:01.060 --> 02:02.940]  Full Spectrum Extract.
[02:02.940 --> 02:06.940]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, in this episode, I am going to do a
[02:06.940 --> 02:11.000]  lesson on re-vegging our flowering plants.
[02:11.000 --> 02:13.580]  Did you grow a plant that was perfect for you?
[02:13.580 --> 02:14.900]  Did you find a winner?
[02:14.900 --> 02:19.140]  But for some reason, you don't have a clone of that plant and you really wish you could
[02:19.140 --> 02:20.140]  grow it again?
[02:20.140 --> 02:21.900]  I do have a solution for you.
[02:21.900 --> 02:24.740]  There is the option of re-veg.
[02:24.740 --> 02:28.880]  Before we get to the lesson on re-vegging our plants, let's do a shout-out to a few
[02:28.880 --> 02:33.340]  of our friends who support the show on Patreon.
[02:33.340 --> 02:36.140]  Let's start off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.

[03:49.380 --> 03:51.260]  It will get you right where you need to be.
[03:51.260 --> 03:54.620]  All right, let's work our way into this grow lesson.
[03:54.620 --> 03:55.940]  I teased it enough.
[03:55.940 --> 03:59.700]  We're going to talk about reveging our cannabis plants.
[03:59.700 --> 04:05.340]  Before we get into the actual process, let's talk about why we might want to revege a cannabis
[04:05.340 --> 04:06.340]  plant.
[04:06.340 --> 04:07.340]  I teased about it earlier.
[04:07.780 --> 04:09.500]  Sometimes you may grow a plant from seed.
[04:09.500 --> 04:14.100]  You may grow a plant from clone, and you may realize this is amazing cannabis.
[04:14.100 --> 04:17.340]  This is the plant I've been searching for my entire life.
[04:17.340 --> 04:19.020]  Not all plants are the same.
[04:19.020 --> 04:20.420]  Not all growers are the same.
[04:20.420 --> 04:22.380]  Not all grow environments are the same.
[04:22.380 --> 04:27.980]  To find the perfect plant for the grower, for the room, is sometimes a real, it's an
[04:27.980 --> 04:28.980]  accomplishment.
[04:28.980 --> 04:29.980]  You feel really excited.
[04:29.980 --> 04:31.700]  You're like, I've got the fucking plant for me.
[04:31.700 --> 04:34.500]  This is the one that does what I need recreationally.
[04:34.500 --> 04:36.860]  Maybe this is the one that is doing what I need financially.
[04:37.380 --> 04:38.700]  It probably grows perfectly for you.
[04:38.700 --> 04:40.100]  It smokes beautifully for you.
[04:40.100 --> 04:41.500]  It tastes perfectly.
[04:41.500 --> 04:44.540]  It cures your ailments or it's stacking up your wallet real well.
[04:44.540 --> 04:48.340]  However you're working with it, sometimes you find that perfect plant, but then you
[04:48.340 --> 04:51.100]  realize I didn't take a clone of this plant.
[04:51.100 --> 04:52.900]  Then you are heartbroken.
[04:52.900 --> 04:55.340]  Sometimes you take a clone of it and the clones don't root.
[04:55.340 --> 04:56.620]  Sometimes the clones die.
[04:56.620 --> 04:57.820]  Sometimes shit happens.
[04:57.820 --> 04:59.320]  Maybe your helper kills the clones.
[04:59.320 --> 05:00.780]  Maybe your cat kills the clones.
[05:00.780 --> 05:05.500]  I don't know what happens, but sometimes we grow the most beautiful plant we've ever seen
[05:05.540 --> 05:09.620]  and we don't have a clone, but we really are kicking ourselves in the ass wishing that
[05:09.620 --> 05:13.540]  we'd done some sort of preservation so we can grow that plant again.
[05:13.540 --> 05:17.060]  And that is where revegging comes into play.
[05:17.060 --> 05:20.420]  Revegging happens at the end of the flowering phase.
[05:20.420 --> 05:26.900]  I like to start revegging around the same time that I begin flushing a finished crop.
[05:26.900 --> 05:28.140]  So you grow your plants.
[05:28.140 --> 05:29.140]  They're almost done.
[05:29.140 --> 05:31.060]  It is almost time to harvest.
[05:31.060 --> 05:36.700]  In the last 10 to 14 days of the flowering phase, we should be flushing our plants.
[05:36.700 --> 05:38.980]  We should just be feeding them clean water.
[05:38.980 --> 05:41.800]  These plants are getting ready for the harvest phase.
[05:41.800 --> 05:46.260]  This is when I like to begin the reveg process.
[05:46.260 --> 05:50.660]  Now I do understand that what I am about to say is kind of new and unique to some people
[05:50.660 --> 05:52.620]  and it may freak you out a little bit.
[05:52.620 --> 05:58.140]  So if you don't want to start your reveg process when you begin the flush phase, that is okay.
[05:58.140 --> 06:02.860]  You can start your reveg process after you have harvested the rest of the room.
[06:02.860 --> 06:04.660]  Just save that plant that you need.
[06:04.660 --> 06:07.760]  And most of my instructions will be basically the same.
[06:07.760 --> 06:10.160]  We will catch up when we get to that part.
[06:10.160 --> 06:15.600]  Now we're going to focus on the reveg phase happening during the flush phase or the last
[06:15.600 --> 06:18.120]  two weeks of the flowering cycle.
[06:18.120 --> 06:23.460]  The thing that is going to tell our plants that we want it to reveg is the light schedule.
[06:23.460 --> 06:27.580]  We made these plants flower by reducing the light to 1212.
[06:27.580 --> 06:32.460]  We gave that plant a long enough dark period to make the plant think that it is the fall
[06:32.460 --> 06:36.160]  season and it should go into flower because the end of its life is near.
[06:36.160 --> 06:39.500]  These plants are accustomed to living for one full cycle.
[06:39.500 --> 06:41.860]  They get one cycle out of life and then they die.
[06:41.860 --> 06:43.080]  They're an annual plant.
[06:43.080 --> 06:44.080]  They don't come back.
[06:44.080 --> 06:47.380]  They make seeds and those seeds are what carries on the generation.
[06:47.380 --> 06:50.340]  The plants don't plan on living more than one season.
[06:50.340 --> 06:54.820]  So if we can trigger our plants into going into the flowering phase by manipulating the
[06:54.820 --> 07:01.420]  light cycle, we can also trigger these plants to go back into the vegetative stage by manipulating
[07:01.420 --> 07:04.220]  the light cycle the opposite direction.
[07:04.220 --> 07:12.500]  So about 10 to 14 days before I plan to harvest my room, I will put my light cycle back on
[07:12.500 --> 07:16.260]  an 18 and 6 light schedule.
[07:16.260 --> 07:19.480]  Now I know that may sound alarming to a lot of new growers.
[07:19.480 --> 07:23.000]  That may sound alarming to a lot of experienced growers.
[07:23.000 --> 07:24.540]  We want these plants to flower.
[07:24.540 --> 07:25.800]  We want them to keep going.
[07:25.800 --> 07:30.060]  We want beautiful, fatty, sticky buds with nice trichomes all over them.
[07:30.060 --> 07:32.260]  That is our main goal for this garden.
[07:32.260 --> 07:36.740]  And now I am telling you to flip your light cycle back to a veg cycle while you're almost
[07:36.740 --> 07:37.740]  done flowering.
[07:37.740 --> 07:38.940]  I know it sounds crazy.
[07:38.940 --> 07:40.540]  I know it sounds scary.
[07:40.540 --> 07:42.300]  Let me explain myself.
[07:42.300 --> 07:47.500]  We are 10 to 14 days away from cutting down these plants.
[07:47.500 --> 07:53.020]  Remember that when we flip the plants into flower, it took them approximately 12 to 15
[07:53.020 --> 07:55.580]  days before they started flowering.
[07:55.580 --> 08:01.280]  These plants are going to take 10 to 14 days before they start showing you any difference
[08:01.280 --> 08:04.580]  that they are trying to go back into a vegetative state.
[08:04.580 --> 08:08.700]  And before these plants get to that, we're going to cut them down.
[08:08.700 --> 08:14.020]  This increased light period is also going to make the buds get thicker and fatter and
[08:14.020 --> 08:15.760]  beefier and chunkier.
[08:15.760 --> 08:19.820]  You will actually potentially increase your harvest weight.
[08:19.820 --> 08:24.440]  This may also potentially speed up your harvest time by a day or three.
[08:24.440 --> 08:26.740]  So pay attention to the trichomes.
[08:26.740 --> 08:28.660]  Also pay attention to the plants.
[08:28.660 --> 08:32.700]  If you see them starting to do any weird things at the tips, it'll be right at the tips of
[08:32.700 --> 08:33.700]  the buds.
[08:33.700 --> 08:36.940]  The very tops of the buds will start to look like they're getting new growth.
[08:36.940 --> 08:39.020]  The minute you see that, it is time to harvest.
[08:39.020 --> 08:42.780]  They are starting to go into a vegetative state and reveg.
[08:42.780 --> 08:48.540]  Most plants will not show you a reveg growth until about day 17, maybe day 21.
[08:48.540 --> 08:53.380]  So I think my 10 to 14 day recommendation of increasing the hours of light will put
[08:53.380 --> 08:58.500]  you in a safe timeframe if you harvest in that 10 to 14 day window.
[08:58.500 --> 09:00.460]  Again, this is plant specific.
[09:00.460 --> 09:02.180]  This is environment specific.
[09:02.180 --> 09:04.340]  So pay attention to your plants.
[09:04.340 --> 09:08.300]  If you know the plants you are growing and you're familiar with them, feel comfortable
[09:08.300 --> 09:10.040]  with that 14 days.
[09:10.040 --> 09:15.220]  If they are new plants and you're not sure what to expect, maybe only go for 10 days.
[09:15.220 --> 09:20.420]  I truly do not think you will have a problem with any sort of reveg before harvest if you
[09:20.420 --> 09:25.100]  start this 10 to 14 days before you plan to cut down.
[09:25.100 --> 09:27.780]  So step number one is to increase the lights.
[09:27.780 --> 09:34.060]  If you can increase the lights from 12-12 or 11-13, if you can put them back on an 18-6
[09:34.060 --> 09:39.260]  or perhaps a 19-5 light cycle, the more light, the merrier at this point.
[09:39.260 --> 09:40.760]  That's what I would recommend.
[09:40.760 --> 09:43.420]  Do not go 24 hours of light at this time.
[09:43.420 --> 09:45.660]  I don't find that to be necessary.
[09:45.660 --> 09:50.920]  If you do want to run a 24 hour schedule after you harvest, that is effective, but let's
[09:50.920 --> 09:55.240]  not do it yet until we chop down the usable part of the plant.
[09:55.240 --> 09:59.640]  So now we've got our plants on an 18-6, perhaps a 19-5 cycle.
[09:59.640 --> 10:03.840]  You will notice that the plants that are closest to the light, that are getting the most light,
[10:03.840 --> 10:06.060]  will begin to reveg the earliest.
[10:06.060 --> 10:10.180]  So if you've got one specific plant which you want to reveg, maybe get that plant in
[10:10.180 --> 10:14.540]  the middle, give it the prime real estate where it is getting the best optimal light,
[10:14.540 --> 10:16.920]  and that will help speed up your process.
[10:16.920 --> 10:21.040]  Now for the next 10-14 days, we are on that extended light cycle.
[10:21.040 --> 10:23.300]  We are going to continue to flush the plants.
[10:23.300 --> 10:25.240]  Now we need to pay attention to the trichomes.
[10:25.240 --> 10:30.040]  We also need to watch for that reveg growth, but things should go just as planned, just
[10:30.040 --> 10:33.180]  like they normally would if we hadn't changed that light cycle.
[10:33.180 --> 10:37.040]  You may get to harvest one to three days early, not a big deal.
[10:37.040 --> 10:38.740]  Pay attention to the trichomes.
[10:38.800 --> 10:44.280]  Now we are going to harvest just like normal, except I would recommend to leave some of
[10:44.280 --> 10:47.040]  the very bottom small buds.
[10:47.040 --> 10:51.140]  If you've got four or five buds on that plant that are the size of your thumb, I've got
[10:51.140 --> 10:52.140]  big thumbs.
[10:52.140 --> 10:54.700]  If they're the size of my thumb or your thumb, that is fine.
[10:54.700 --> 10:58.720]  Leave yourself somewhere between three and five little buds on the bottom of that plant.
[10:58.720 --> 10:59.760]  Cut the rest of it off.
[10:59.760 --> 11:04.160]  Leave those buds there so that you've just got some sticks with four or five little buds
[11:04.160 --> 11:08.680]  on it, and that is going to be your new plant that you are going to focus on revegging.
[11:09.620 --> 11:14.420]  That plant has already been under an extended light cycle, so it is already beginning to
[11:14.420 --> 11:16.460]  adjust to that light cycle.
[11:16.460 --> 11:20.320]  It knows inside that we want it to begin revegging.
[11:20.320 --> 11:22.400]  It already is trying to do that.
[11:22.400 --> 11:24.460]  Now we have removed all those giant buds.
[11:24.460 --> 11:26.620]  We've just got a little bit of that plant left.
[11:26.620 --> 11:31.460]  It is much easier for that plant to revert that little tiny batch of hormones to fix
[11:31.460 --> 11:35.960]  that little tiny part of that plant instead of trying to revert that entire plant back
[11:35.960 --> 11:36.960]  to veg.
[11:37.040 --> 11:41.020]  Now we've just got a couple little buds, four or five little buds, and they're going to
[11:41.020 --> 11:42.140]  start revegging.
[11:42.140 --> 11:45.240]  They're going to slowly go back to the veg phase.
[11:45.240 --> 11:49.200]  I mentioned earlier that at this point, if you've got a room where you can do it, you
[11:49.200 --> 11:52.040]  can put this plant under 24-7 lighting.
[11:52.040 --> 11:56.400]  You want 24 hours a day lighting for this plant if you've got that space.
[11:56.400 --> 12:02.960]  If you don't have that space, put it under an 18-6 or a 19-5 veg schedule, and this plant
[12:02.960 --> 12:05.880]  will slowly begin to grow new growth.
[12:05.880 --> 12:10.920]  It will start to make kind of funky, kind of twisted, kind of weird leaves.
[12:10.920 --> 12:14.520]  That is what is expected from a plant that is revegging.
[12:14.520 --> 12:19.280]  You just took a plant and basically put it through puberty and made that plant go from
[12:19.280 --> 12:23.680]  a pubescent teenager all the way to an adult, all the way to the point where it thought
[12:23.680 --> 12:28.760]  it should die, and now you were returning it back to that prepubescent stage of its
[12:28.760 --> 12:29.760]  life.
[12:29.760 --> 12:33.160]  It is going to make some weird-shaped leaves for a little while.
[12:33.160 --> 12:34.480]  It'll look like dill.
[12:34.480 --> 12:35.720]  It'll look like mint.
[12:35.720 --> 12:38.040]  It'll make some really weird leaves.
[12:38.040 --> 12:39.040]  Don't freak out.
[12:39.040 --> 12:40.040]  Be patient.
[12:40.040 --> 12:41.600]  That is to be expected.
[12:41.600 --> 12:47.600]  Eventually, those leaves will grow out and make shoots that begin to look like normal
[12:47.600 --> 12:48.600]  cannabis leaves.
[12:48.600 --> 12:52.900]  They will look just like the leaves that grew on that plant the first time you grew it.
[12:52.900 --> 12:58.320]  The amount of time it is going to take for this plant to start revegging depends on several
[12:58.320 --> 12:59.640]  factors.
[12:59.640 --> 13:02.000]  The first factor is genetics.
[13:02.000 --> 13:03.320]  Where is this plant from?
[13:03.320 --> 13:06.320]  What part of the planet did this plant originate from?
[13:06.320 --> 13:08.320]  How much light does it expect to get?
[13:08.320 --> 13:10.160]  How much light is it used to getting?
[13:10.160 --> 13:12.680]  And then how much light are you giving it?
[13:12.680 --> 13:16.760]  Light is probably the second determining factor when it comes to a reveg.
[13:16.760 --> 13:21.800]  If you've got good genetics and you've got enough light, it may revege much more quickly
[13:21.800 --> 13:24.600]  than different genetics under weak lights.
[13:24.600 --> 13:30.600]  Also, before I mentioned turning that light cycle to an 18-6 or a 19-5 while we were in
[13:30.600 --> 13:35.640]  flower, if you did that, you were going to be two weeks ahead of the game as opposed
[13:35.640 --> 13:39.560]  to if you did not change your light cycle until you harvested.
[13:39.560 --> 13:41.200]  Both methods will work.
[13:41.200 --> 13:45.340]  The second method where we don't change the light until after harvest is obviously going
[13:45.340 --> 13:48.920]  to put us two weeks behind the revege game.
[13:48.920 --> 13:50.760]  So pay attention to those leaves.
[13:50.760 --> 13:51.760]  That's where we were.
[13:51.760 --> 13:52.760]  Pay attention to the leaves.
[13:52.760 --> 13:54.240]  They're going to start growing dill-looking leaves.
[13:54.240 --> 13:57.680]  They're going to start growing really weird, curly, twisty leaves.
[13:57.680 --> 13:58.680]  That is okay.
[13:58.760 --> 14:03.120]  If the plant is going to freak out for a little while, be patient with the plant.
[14:03.120 --> 14:07.520]  While the plant is freaking out, there are a few things we can do to make it more comfortable
[14:07.520 --> 14:10.600]  and also speed up this process.
[14:10.600 --> 14:15.980]  One thing to consider is that this plant has spent its entire life in the container which
[14:15.980 --> 14:17.520]  it is potted in.
[14:17.520 --> 14:22.000]  It may be useful to re-pot this plant into a larger container.
[14:22.000 --> 14:25.840]  If this plant was in a 3-gallon, maybe consider putting it in a 5.
[14:25.840 --> 14:28.760]  If it was in a 5, maybe go for a 7.
[14:28.760 --> 14:30.360]  Maybe go for a 10.
[14:30.360 --> 14:35.840]  If you chose the appropriate size pot for that plant on its first run, it should be
[14:35.840 --> 14:39.840]  greatly root-bound inside that container by now.
[14:39.840 --> 14:43.200]  Those roots should fill all of that space.
[14:43.200 --> 14:45.680]  Plants that are root-bound want to go into flower.
[14:45.680 --> 14:46.680]  They are in panic mode.
[14:46.680 --> 14:48.360]  They're going, hey, my shoes are too tight.
[14:48.360 --> 14:49.360]  I got to do something.
[14:49.360 --> 14:50.720]  And they start freaking out.
[14:50.720 --> 14:55.000]  It will be more challenging to revege a plant which is root-bound.
[14:55.160 --> 15:00.360]  A good idea, something that may help you out, would be to up-pot that plant into a larger
[15:00.360 --> 15:01.360]  pot.
[15:01.360 --> 15:03.320]  When you take that pot, it's real easy.
[15:03.320 --> 15:04.320]  Don't be scared.
[15:04.320 --> 15:05.680]  Lay the plant on its side.
[15:05.680 --> 15:07.880]  Shimmy that pot right off of it.
[15:07.880 --> 15:11.400]  Then take that root ball and break it up with your fingers a little bit.
[15:11.400 --> 15:15.080]  Then have that next container of soil filled about halfway.
[15:15.080 --> 15:16.520]  Set your plant right in there.
[15:16.520 --> 15:18.880]  Then just top-fill the rest of the soil on it.
[15:18.880 --> 15:20.160]  Then give it a good water.
[15:20.160 --> 15:25.600]  Your plant will be happy with you for giving it new shoes, bigger tires, a fresh home.
[15:25.600 --> 15:27.760]  Just be careful not to break any of the branches.
[15:27.760 --> 15:30.160]  You've only got a couple of small buds left on there.
[15:30.160 --> 15:32.800]  It should be a fairly easy process.
[15:32.800 --> 15:36.680]  One useful tip is to up-pot your plant into a larger container.
[15:36.680 --> 15:38.200]  That way it is not root-bound.
[15:38.200 --> 15:41.100]  That way it knows, hey, this guy wants me to grow more.
[15:41.100 --> 15:43.000]  It's expecting a little more for me.
[15:43.000 --> 15:45.200]  Then hopefully it will give it to you.
[15:45.200 --> 15:51.880]  Another way to get more from this plant is to begin feeding it a solid, vegetative nutrient mix.
[15:51.880 --> 15:53.280]  Let's go back to veg-noods.
[15:53.280 --> 15:54.740]  We don't want it to flower.
[15:54.740 --> 15:56.080]  We need nitrogen.
[15:56.080 --> 15:58.640]  Let's start giving it vegetative-noods.
[15:58.640 --> 16:04.000]  Don't forget that just because you've got a small plant, you still have a large root zone.
[16:04.000 --> 16:06.600]  Water that container like you've got a large root zone.
[16:06.600 --> 16:09.920]  It will take a few days for it to dry, but it will be okay.
[16:09.920 --> 16:13.600]  Keep in mind that you've got more roots in there than you've got plant up top.
[16:13.600 --> 16:15.080]  Think about that as you are watering.
[16:15.080 --> 16:18.440]  Don't go drowning the plant because I said that and then blame it on me.
[16:18.440 --> 16:22.160]  Keep in mind there's more below the ground than what you see.
[16:22.160 --> 16:25.880]  That part up top is just a very small representation of the root ball.
[16:25.880 --> 16:28.460]  Hopefully you saw that root zone when you re-potted.
[16:28.460 --> 16:30.920]  You know exactly how much you need to water.
[16:30.920 --> 16:33.200]  Now we've got our plants on an extended light cycle.
[16:33.200 --> 16:37.620]  They're either on 18.6, 19.5, or 24 and 0.
[16:37.620 --> 16:39.980]  Another thing to keep in mind is the appropriate spectrum.
[16:39.980 --> 16:42.840]  At this time, we want to use a vegetative light.
[16:42.840 --> 16:44.440]  Maybe you've got a metal halide light.
[16:44.800 --> 16:46.760]  Maybe you're using a ceramic metal halide.
[16:46.760 --> 16:48.440]  Maybe you're using an LED.
[16:48.440 --> 16:51.560]  It would be ideal to use the appropriate spectrum.
[16:51.560 --> 16:54.040]  More of a blue light and less of a red light.
[16:54.040 --> 16:56.800]  Something geared, aimed more at vegetative growth.
[16:56.800 --> 17:00.800]  We're trying to get the plant to go back into veg, so let's give it the appropriate spectrum.
[17:00.800 --> 17:03.200]  Guys, I'm going to hit pause and take a drink.
[17:03.200 --> 17:04.200]  Don't let me lose my place.
[17:04.200 --> 17:05.440]  All right, that was quick.
[17:05.440 --> 17:06.880]  I'm sure you could hear my voice messing up.
[17:06.880 --> 17:08.320]  I did not want that to continue.
[17:08.320 --> 17:09.320]  Here we go.
[17:09.320 --> 17:10.760]  We've got our extended light cycle.
[17:10.760 --> 17:12.440]  We have up-potted our plants.
[17:12.440 --> 17:14.960]  Now they are on the way to trying to reveg.
[17:14.960 --> 17:17.400]  We are feeding them vegetative nutrients.
[17:17.400 --> 17:19.660]  We want to give them strong veg nudes.
[17:19.660 --> 17:24.240]  Maybe give them some type of a kelp product that will encourage them to reveg and speed
[17:24.240 --> 17:25.600]  up for you.
[17:25.600 --> 17:27.440]  The plants will continue to grow.
[17:27.440 --> 17:30.000]  They will continue to come out of that weird growth.
[17:30.000 --> 17:33.760]  Like I said before, you'll start seeing weird leaves come out of your buds.
[17:33.760 --> 17:36.000]  Just weird looking, oddly shaped leaves.
[17:36.000 --> 17:37.000]  They may be twisty.
[17:37.000 --> 17:38.000]  They may be curly.
[17:38.000 --> 17:39.680]  They may not go the right direction.
[17:39.680 --> 17:41.480]  Let that plant grow.
[17:41.520 --> 17:45.360]  Over time, it will begin to produce normal looking shoots.
[17:45.360 --> 17:49.040]  It'll just have little shoots grow right out of the bud.
[17:49.040 --> 17:53.720]  Those shoots will begin to produce normal looking leaves.
[17:53.720 --> 17:58.360]  It will kind of look like you just cut a clone and put a clone right inside one of your buds
[17:58.360 --> 18:00.680]  and a clone grew out of your bud.
[18:00.680 --> 18:04.840]  It will begin to make perfect leaves just like the original plant did.
[18:04.840 --> 18:09.000]  Like I mentioned before, I don't know exactly when to expect this because this is going
[18:09.000 --> 18:14.720]  to be strain dependent, environment dependent, feed dependent, and also it's going to depend
[18:14.720 --> 18:18.040]  on when you started changing that light schedule.
[18:18.040 --> 18:19.360]  So pay attention.
[18:19.360 --> 18:24.040]  Once it starts making good looking clones come out of the top of the buds, that is when
[18:24.040 --> 18:26.840]  it is time to clone that plant.
[18:26.840 --> 18:31.160]  Take that part that looks like a clone coming out of your bud and simply clone it.
[18:31.160 --> 18:34.560]  Snip it off of there and clone it just like you would any other clone.
[18:34.560 --> 18:38.000]  If you're going into an easy cloner, do it just like you would.
[18:38.000 --> 18:41.640]  Cut it, put a little snip in the middle, dip it in the cloning gel, put it in the easy
[18:41.640 --> 18:44.360]  cloner and let it rock for four to seven days.
[18:44.360 --> 18:46.040]  You'll start seeing roots.
[18:46.040 --> 18:50.000]  If you're going to put your clone in a rapid rooter or a root riot or maybe a rockwool
[18:50.000 --> 18:55.160]  cube, whatever you prefer, take your clone, cut that nice 45 degree angle on there, scrape
[18:55.160 --> 18:59.280]  the clone up a little bit to take off that outer surface, dip it right in your cloning
[18:59.280 --> 19:03.800]  solution, put it in your rapid rooter, put it in the dome, make sure your rooters are
[19:03.800 --> 19:07.760]  treated and soaked properly and don't touch it for four or five days.
[19:07.760 --> 19:09.120]  Open it up and check on it.
[19:09.120 --> 19:14.800]  And over time, whichever method you choose, you will have a beautiful new clone.
[19:14.800 --> 19:20.000]  Now what I recommend is that you take that clone and pot it and treat it as a mother
[19:20.000 --> 19:21.000]  plant.
[19:21.000 --> 19:25.160]  Let that plant grow up and start producing branches and arms and shoots.
[19:25.160 --> 19:31.920]  Then use those branches and arms and shoots as your new clones for your next crop.
[19:31.920 --> 19:33.240]  So let me kind of repeat that.
[19:33.680 --> 19:37.240]  You are going to clone the shoot that grows out of the bud.
[19:37.240 --> 19:40.120]  That is going to become your new mother plant.
[19:40.120 --> 19:46.280]  Once that plant creates branches, take clones off of that plant and grow those.
[19:46.280 --> 19:48.920]  Those branches and those shoots are ready to rock.
[19:48.920 --> 19:50.880]  You won't see any stress from them.
[19:50.880 --> 19:53.660]  They won't even remember that they were reveged.
[19:53.660 --> 19:59.360]  Those plants that you cut should act just like that original mom plant that you fell
[19:59.360 --> 20:02.680]  in love with that we forgot to take clones from.
[20:02.680 --> 20:06.160]  So I feel like I have covered a quick lesson on reveging.
[20:06.160 --> 20:10.400]  I'm going to recap really quickly just to make sure I didn't leave anything out.
[20:10.400 --> 20:13.840]  It all starts before harvest at the flush time.
[20:13.840 --> 20:16.660]  Change your lights back to 18-6 if you can.
[20:16.660 --> 20:18.600]  If not, that is understandable.
[20:18.600 --> 20:21.680]  We will wait until after harvest and we will deal with that.
[20:21.680 --> 20:22.880]  Then we're going to harvest.
[20:22.880 --> 20:27.040]  We're going to leave somewhere between three and five little buds at the bottom of the
[20:27.040 --> 20:31.380]  plant just with a few leaves sticking off of them so that we've got opportunity for
[20:31.380 --> 20:32.380]  fresh growth.
[20:32.380 --> 20:34.020]  So we have fixed our lights.
[20:34.020 --> 20:35.140]  We have harvested.
[20:35.140 --> 20:36.860]  We've left a few small buds.
[20:36.860 --> 20:43.080]  Now let's change the light cycle back to 18-6 or 24-7, whichever works best for you.
[20:43.080 --> 20:46.380]  Then up-pot that plant if you've got the opportunity.
[20:46.380 --> 20:48.300]  The pot, the soil, and the space.
[20:48.300 --> 20:50.060]  I really recommend that.
[20:50.060 --> 20:53.820]  Then we've got to feed these plants a vegetative mix.
[20:53.820 --> 20:56.900]  Then over time, you'll see that new growth start coming out.
[20:56.900 --> 20:58.440]  Pay attention to that.
[20:58.440 --> 21:00.220]  Don't cut off any of that funky shit.
[21:00.220 --> 21:01.220]  Just let it grow.
[21:01.220 --> 21:02.420]  The hormones are moving around.
[21:02.420 --> 21:04.380]  The plant's doing what it needs to do.
[21:04.380 --> 21:05.860]  Let that weird shit grow.
[21:05.860 --> 21:06.860]  It'll stop happening.
[21:06.860 --> 21:10.820]  Then eventually, you'll see beautiful new growth coming out of it.
[21:10.820 --> 21:15.500]  Once you see that new growth that looks normal, that looks like the old familiar plant, take
[21:15.500 --> 21:16.940]  a few clones.
[21:16.940 --> 21:19.380]  Use those clones as future clone donors.
[21:19.380 --> 21:23.980]  We also call those mother plants, but grow those plants up and take clones off of those
[21:23.980 --> 21:26.820]  and use those clones as your next crop.
[21:26.820 --> 21:29.580]  So yes, you do have to revege the plant.
[21:29.580 --> 21:30.780]  Then you have to clone it.
[21:30.780 --> 21:32.740]  Then you have to clone that clone.
[21:32.740 --> 21:34.300]  Those clones will be reliable.
[21:34.300 --> 21:36.820]  I feel like those plants will be back to normal.
[21:36.820 --> 21:39.460]  You won't see any stress or any issues.
[21:39.460 --> 21:44.340]  Like I said before, they will not even remember that the plant they came from had ever been
[21:44.340 --> 21:45.340]  flowered.
[21:45.340 --> 21:47.880]  So that is my quick lesson on revege.
[21:47.880 --> 21:49.380]  That is my quick recap.
[21:49.380 --> 21:50.980]  I hope you guys followed along.
[21:50.980 --> 21:52.500]  I hope I made it clear.
[21:52.500 --> 21:56.460]  If you've got any questions or concerns, please send me an email.

[23:08.060 --> 23:11.020]  I want to give a giant shout out to my buddy, Jack Greenstock.
[23:11.020 --> 23:14.500]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[23:14.500 --> 23:41.400]  Down with disease, freaks in my bed.
[23:41.400 --> 23:44.400]  Trying to stop these demons that eat.
[23:44.400 --> 23:46.400]  Dancing in my head.
[23:46.460 --> 23:55.410]  Down with disease.
[23:55.410 --> 23:57.410]  And I'm up before the dawn.
[23:57.410 --> 23:59.410]  A thousand barefoot children outside.
[23:59.410 --> 24:01.410]  Dancing on my lawn.
[24:07.110 --> 24:09.110]  Dancing on my lawn.
[24:09.110 --> 24:13.110]  Waiting for the time when I can finally say,
[24:13.110 --> 24:15.110]  This is all been wonderful.
[24:15.110 --> 24:17.110]  But now I'm on my way.
[24:17.110 --> 24:21.110]  When I think it's time to leave it all behind.
[24:21.110 --> 24:25.110]  I try to find a way to, but there's nothing I can say to make it stop.
[24:26.110 --> 24:32.110]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[24:40.770 --> 24:42.770]  Down with disease.
[24:42.770 --> 24:44.770]  And the jungle's in my mind.
[24:44.770 --> 24:46.770]  I'm climbing up my waterfall thing.
[24:46.770 --> 24:48.770]  Swinging off my vines.
[24:56.180 --> 24:58.180]  So I try to hear the music.
[24:58.180 --> 25:00.180]  But I'm always losing time.
[25:00.240 --> 25:02.240]  I'm always stepping on my rhythm.
[25:02.240 --> 25:04.240]  And they're stealing all my lines.
[25:09.660 --> 25:11.660]  Stealing all my lines.
[25:11.660 --> 25:15.660]  And I keep waiting for the time when I can finally say,
[25:15.660 --> 25:17.660]  That this is all been wonderful.
[25:17.660 --> 25:19.660]  But now I'm on my way.
[25:19.660 --> 25:23.660]  When I think it's time to leave it all behind.
[25:23.660 --> 25:27.660]  I try to find a way to, but there's nothing I can say to make it stop.
[25:27.660 --> 25:31.660]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[25:32.660 --> 25:58.420]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[25:58.420 --> 26:00.420]  Waiting for the time when I can finally say,
[26:00.420 --> 26:03.420]  That this is all been wonderful.
[26:03.420 --> 26:05.420]  But now I'm on my way.
[26:05.420 --> 26:09.420]  When I think it's time to leave it all behind.
[26:09.420 --> 26:15.420]  I try to find a way to, but there's nothing I can say to make it stop.
