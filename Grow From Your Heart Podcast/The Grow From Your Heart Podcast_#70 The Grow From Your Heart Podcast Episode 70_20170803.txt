[00:13.500 --> 00:16.860]  It's time for episode number 70 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:16.860 --> 00:24.040]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right.
[00:24.040 --> 00:25.920]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:25.920 --> 00:27.840]  if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber,
[00:27.840 --> 00:30.400]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the
[00:30.400 --> 00:34.120]  current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:35.120 --> 00:37.800]  I'm your host Rasta Jeff. Thanks again for joining me as always.
[00:37.800 --> 00:39.120]  I want to send a big, huge thank you.
[00:39.120 --> 00:40.000]  Shout out to the Mr.
[00:40.000 --> 00:40.840]  And Mrs.
[00:40.840 --> 00:42.040]  For being here with us today.
[00:42.040 --> 00:43.080]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[00:43.080 --> 00:44.080]  Thanks again for joining me.
[00:44.080 --> 00:45.840]  As always, I want to send a big, huge thank you.
[00:45.840 --> 00:48.560]  Shout out to the mystic roots band for letting me use their music on the show.
[00:48.880 --> 00:51.360]  Thanks to cat coop and the entire mystic roots crew.
[00:51.360 --> 00:53.520]  The song you're listening to right now is called the doggy dub.
[00:53.960 --> 00:57.160]  Make sure you support my friends in the mystic roots crew. What's up everybody.
[00:57.160 --> 00:59.440]  I've got a great show put together for you to cat for you guys.
[00:59.600 --> 01:01.400]  I'm going to turn that music down. That's really distracting.
[01:02.160 --> 01:03.720]  Just cut that right out. There we go.
[01:03.960 --> 01:05.840]  So I got a few things I want to talk about first.
[01:05.840 --> 01:08.840]  I want to give a huge shout out to everybody that's helped me out this past
[01:08.840 --> 01:09.960]  week. Um,
[01:09.960 --> 01:13.920]  I was driving up to Colorado Springs to go see our good friends hunt and damsel
[01:13.920 --> 01:17.720]  and of course the Jordans. And of course, John Randall's junior,
[01:17.800 --> 01:20.400]  who's headed up there to spring was going to go pay them a visit.
[01:21.000 --> 01:24.840]  And uh, the fucking transmission went out on my car about, uh,
[01:25.000 --> 01:28.880]  a mile from Colorado Springs. I could see the first exit in Colorado Springs.
[01:28.880 --> 01:32.720]  I could see the damn circle drive Lake Avenue sign right in front of me,
[01:32.720 --> 01:35.680]  but I just couldn't get off the highway. My car pretty much exploded.
[01:35.680 --> 01:39.360]  It felt like I was doing a good 75 miles an hour on the interstate in the rain.
[01:40.240 --> 01:43.480]  Uh, it felt like my car downshifted, uh, from 75.
[01:43.480 --> 01:47.240]  I immediately was going about 45 miles an hour. Uh, it sounded like, uh,
[01:47.400 --> 01:51.520]  that was sort of like, and then it was like, is what it felt like to me. Uh,
[01:51.520 --> 01:54.240]  I felt like my engine was trying to jump out of the car and into my lap.
[01:54.240 --> 01:56.080]  So of course I hit the brakes, uh,
[01:56.080 --> 01:58.480]  signaled got over as quickly as I could got to the side of the road,
[01:58.480 --> 02:01.280]  turn on the hazards called triple a, it took triple a.
[02:01.360 --> 02:06.040]  They quoted me 85 minutes to get there. They got there in 65. So, uh,
[02:06.720 --> 02:09.640]  fucking 85 minute is a long 85 minute. Wait is a long wait.
[02:09.640 --> 02:11.800]  65 minutes was less than what they promised me.
[02:11.800 --> 02:14.680]  So I guess that that's a good job on triple a's part.
[02:15.080 --> 02:16.920]  I made friends with the triple a tow truck driver.
[02:16.920 --> 02:19.320]  I wish I had your business card with me right now in my pocket,
[02:19.560 --> 02:21.040]  but I have said it somewhere. Uh, you know what?
[02:21.040 --> 02:23.720]  It's actually in the car that's broken down that is at the mechanic shop.
[02:24.120 --> 02:25.360]  So once I get your card out of there,
[02:25.360 --> 02:27.960]  I'll give you a shout out on the show because the truck driver was a cool guy.
[02:28.320 --> 02:30.200]  Uh, they did a great job. They were super kind.
[02:30.200 --> 02:34.120]  They had to tell me about 50 miles home, get me back to the house, but I'm here.
[02:34.120 --> 02:37.000]  I'm safe. I don't have a car for a little bit here. We're figuring that out.
[02:37.480 --> 02:39.920]  It's going to cost a little bit to get that son of a bitch fixed.
[02:39.920 --> 02:43.320]  But anyway, I'm trying to move on, trying to have a good week. Uh,
[02:43.320 --> 02:45.520]  we are going to talk about cannabis here, but I want to talk a little bit first.
[02:46.240 --> 02:48.480]  Uh, you guys know that I hit my head at the beginning of April, right?
[02:48.480 --> 02:53.160]  And it is now I'm recording this. Uh, the date is May 14th as we record.
[02:53.920 --> 02:57.920]  Uh, I feel like I'm getting it back together so much. You guys,
[02:58.160 --> 03:01.520]  I want to thank you for tolerating my bullshit while I've had a head wound. Uh,
[03:01.520 --> 03:05.440]  I know I've been goofy. I really do. I wasn't all there. I apologize.
[03:05.520 --> 03:07.680]  But you guys that stuck with me, you're my friends. I love you.
[03:07.960 --> 03:08.880]  Thanks for supporting the show.
[03:08.880 --> 03:11.800]  Thanks for being there while I was kind of down. Uh,
[03:11.800 --> 03:13.720]  I want to talk about a product I ordered online.
[03:13.720 --> 03:17.320]  I've been taking something called alpha brain. You can get it at on it.com.
[03:17.320 --> 03:20.440]  There's two ends in that it's O N N I T on it.
[03:20.440 --> 03:21.800]  Labs makes a lot of great products.
[03:21.800 --> 03:25.520]  I'm going to reach for my bottle of alpha brain right here. Hold on. All right.
[03:25.520 --> 03:26.480]  I got the bottle in my hand.
[03:26.760 --> 03:31.760]  Alpha brain is a complete earth grown nootropic with alpha GPC and AC 11.
[03:32.040 --> 03:35.200]  I know that sounds like a bunch of bullshit to you guys, but, um,
[03:35.200 --> 03:39.640]  they say that, uh, lecturers, educators, uh, speakers,
[03:39.640 --> 03:44.160]  public speakers, radio personalities, and folks like that use alpha brain. Uh,
[03:44.160 --> 03:47.840]  the guy that inspired me to use it is Joe Rogan. When Joe Rogan does his podcast,
[03:47.840 --> 03:51.440]  he takes a couple of alpha brain. When he does the UFC events, he, uh,
[03:51.480 --> 03:53.320]  announces the commentates on the UFCs.
[03:54.080 --> 03:56.000]  He does three alpha brain pills for that.
[03:56.400 --> 04:01.160]  I've been taking two a day and I can feel a sharpness in my brain.
[04:01.440 --> 04:04.280]  My vocabulary is stronger. Um,
[04:04.400 --> 04:07.600]  I had a problem after I hit my head. I would try to recall words and I'd say,
[04:07.600 --> 04:10.120]  Hey, can you hand me my, my,
[04:10.240 --> 04:14.280]  and I just couldn't think of what basic words were like screwdriver or
[04:14.280 --> 04:16.960]  flashlight. Sometimes I would just forget words,
[04:16.960 --> 04:19.880]  but the alpha brain is making that shit come back to me. Uh,
[04:19.880 --> 04:24.200]  it's making me a better speaker. It's making me remember and recall more. Uh,
[04:24.200 --> 04:27.520]  it's making me calmer. I've described it as, maybe I've said this on the show.
[04:27.520 --> 04:29.000]  Maybe I'm full of shit with my memory thing,
[04:29.240 --> 04:32.600]  but I've described it as a, my brain has the main track that's happening.
[04:32.600 --> 04:35.360]  There's like the, you gotta wake up, you gotta poop, you gotta brush your teeth.
[04:35.360 --> 04:37.440]  You gotta get to work on time. You gotta do your chores.
[04:37.440 --> 04:40.200]  You gotta call this person. You know, that track is playing in your head,
[04:40.220 --> 04:42.680]  but there's always that side bullshit that goes on in your head,
[04:43.040 --> 04:46.400]  like taxes and it just whispers at you occasionally.
[04:46.440 --> 04:48.680]  Or I wonder what that girl's doing.
[04:49.000 --> 04:52.120]  Or I miss somebody or just bullshit that happens in your head that you really
[04:52.140 --> 04:53.800]  don't need to be focusing on right now.
[04:53.880 --> 04:57.480]  I feel like weird things pop up into your head and the alpha brain has kind of
[04:57.480 --> 04:59.240]  quieted that secondary track.
[04:59.480 --> 05:02.040]  So where I'm able to focus on what I'm supposed to focus on,
[05:02.920 --> 05:05.920]  which gets me to my point, the podcasts are getting much better. You guys,
[05:05.920 --> 05:08.760]  I'm going to make the podcast a lot better, much, much better.
[05:08.760 --> 05:11.480]  So shout out to alpha brain, shout out to on it labs. Um,
[05:11.500 --> 05:15.840]  I take two a day and I definitely feel, um, I'm more talkative,
[05:15.860 --> 05:19.480]  but it's because my thoughts are more clear and I can put together much better
[05:19.500 --> 05:22.360]  sentences, much better podcasts. Definitely. Oh dude,
[05:22.360 --> 05:25.880]  I got the phone on loud here. That's ridiculous. You put that bitch on silent.
[05:25.880 --> 05:28.920]  I apologize. That's very unprofessional podcast behavior. Here we go.
[05:29.520 --> 05:33.920]  I got the phone on silent. Uh, so I want to talk about another product. Um,
[05:34.320 --> 05:37.640]  you heard us talk about Floria on our previous podcast episode.
[05:37.920 --> 05:42.120]  Floria is a medicated personal lubricant, which means it is a, uh,
[05:42.320 --> 05:45.640]  it's a sexual lubricant that contains cannabis. Uh,
[05:45.640 --> 05:49.320]  somebody heard that I talked about it on the show and they gave me a product
[05:49.340 --> 05:51.600]  called Evos. And from what I can tell,
[05:51.600 --> 05:56.600]  Evos and Floria are very, very similar. Fairly similar was what I wanted to say.
[05:57.240 --> 05:58.040]  Uh,
[05:58.040 --> 06:01.840]  they are both coconut oil infused with cannabis and they are meant to be
[06:01.860 --> 06:05.760]  applied to, you know, the instructions pretty much say apply it to the females
[06:05.780 --> 06:08.800]  parts. So I'm going to be straight up about this. I got some, uh,
[06:08.840 --> 06:13.840]  Evos and I, uh, sprayed it up on my partner's goods and,
[06:14.080 --> 06:17.600]  uh, it made a difference. It definitely, uh,
[06:17.640 --> 06:21.080]  there was nothing to complain about before everything was going just fine.
[06:21.080 --> 06:25.080]  But when we added that stuff, it made it a little, uh, it made my junk warm.
[06:25.120 --> 06:27.280]  It felt like it's already warm. I know,
[06:27.280 --> 06:30.840]  but it felt a little warmer and tingly or it made my stuff feel a little more
[06:30.840 --> 06:35.560]  alert. Like it was definitely a heightened experience. And she agreed.
[06:35.880 --> 06:38.040]  She said that it was definitely a heightened experience. Uh,
[06:38.040 --> 06:39.920]  it's just coconut oil and cannabis.
[06:39.940 --> 06:44.720]  So I had no worries about putting it on my body or in her body or whatever. Uh,
[06:44.760 --> 06:48.120]  it washed off really cleanly and really quickly. Uh,
[06:48.120 --> 06:51.160]  one funny thing that I said when I was done and I'm sorry if I'm being too
[06:51.180 --> 06:53.880]  explicit, you guys, but it's my podcast and I'll talk about my dick if I want.
[06:54.680 --> 06:59.840]  Uh, when I was done, uh, I was, I felt I wasn't a rouse.
[06:59.880 --> 07:01.760]  Okay. I was all done and soft. I'm all floppy,
[07:01.920 --> 07:03.480]  but I felt like my dick was fluffy.
[07:03.920 --> 07:07.240]  Like I've given somebody a massage with apothecary lotion before.
[07:07.240 --> 07:10.240]  And I've explained my hands, like feeling like I was wearing Mickey mouse gloves.
[07:10.480 --> 07:14.080]  My dick felt like it was fluffy, like to the touch. If I would touch it,
[07:14.080 --> 07:18.440]  I felt like it was thicker than it was. That's a weird, uh, okay.
[07:18.440 --> 07:20.960]  Enough about my dong on the show, but I tried the Evos.
[07:20.960 --> 07:24.080]  And, uh, if you're looking for something to add to the bedroom fun,
[07:24.080 --> 07:26.920]  and you want to go to the dispensary and spend a few bucks, uh,
[07:26.960 --> 07:29.120]  there's nothing wrong with Evos. It worked. I would use it.
[07:29.120 --> 07:32.400]  I would do that again. If you're listening, let's do that again.
[07:33.040 --> 07:36.080]  So we talked about alpha brain. We talked about Evos.
[07:36.480 --> 07:37.760]  Let's change the tone a little bit.
[07:37.760 --> 07:40.800]  This is something that is not good that happens. Um,
[07:41.280 --> 07:44.200]  I was trying to explain to a friend something and I don't know the science
[07:44.200 --> 07:47.640]  behind it, but I know that this is happening. When my dad rig gets dirty,
[07:48.120 --> 07:50.400]  my chunk of globby resin in there.
[07:50.400 --> 07:53.280]  And this probably applies to the bong with bong resin if you're just smoking
[07:53.280 --> 07:56.560]  flour. But I've noticed that when I'm hitting the dab rig, um,
[07:56.640 --> 07:58.000]  once the rig gets dirty,
[07:58.200 --> 08:01.920]  I feel like that chunk of resin in there is actually stealing part of my dab.
[08:02.360 --> 08:05.160]  I feel like when you've got a big floater, if you look at my rig right now,
[08:05.160 --> 08:08.840]  there is like a quarter gram of hash just floating in my rig water.
[08:08.840 --> 08:10.040]  And it's not old.
[08:10.040 --> 08:12.360]  The rig water has only been in there for three or four days at the most.
[08:13.120 --> 08:16.080]  We just dab heavy here. The senile never turns off. You guys,
[08:16.920 --> 08:17.840]  it's like the coffee pot.
[08:17.840 --> 08:20.280]  It turns on at a certain time in the morning and then it goes off right when I
[08:20.280 --> 08:23.840]  go to bed. So I'm taking big fat globs, right?
[08:23.840 --> 08:26.760]  I'll clean the rig and take fat globs, fat globs. I get super baked,
[08:26.760 --> 08:28.760]  like just like I should. But as the rig gets dirtier,
[08:28.760 --> 08:32.720]  I stopped getting as high and stop choking and stop enjoying my dad as much as
[08:32.720 --> 08:36.200]  it gets dirtier. I think that chunk of resin in there collects the resin.
[08:36.200 --> 08:37.040]  That's the smoke.
[08:37.040 --> 08:39.640]  It collects all your cannabinoids and your smoke and your whatever you're trying
[08:39.640 --> 08:43.680]  to get. It sticks to that ball and it's ripping you off. So my point,
[08:43.800 --> 08:46.760]  clean your fucking rig, go get some rubbing alcohol.
[08:46.840 --> 08:49.440]  If it's really super sticky, get yourself some kosher salt,
[08:49.960 --> 08:53.200]  fill the rig halfway up with alcohol, put a little bit of kosher salt in there.
[08:53.200 --> 08:54.640]  The salt is working as an abrasive.
[08:54.680 --> 08:57.720]  It's going to scratch all that resin off of there. Cover up both holes,
[08:58.800 --> 09:00.480]  go somewhere where you've got a carpeted floor.
[09:00.480 --> 09:02.760]  If you're a pothead and just shake the shit out of that rig.
[09:02.800 --> 09:05.160]  And the reason we're going to the carpeted floors so that when you drop the
[09:05.160 --> 09:08.640]  rig, you have a better chance of living. Uh, just be careful.
[09:08.680 --> 09:12.440]  Just go shake the shit out of that rig. And then, uh, yeah,
[09:12.440 --> 09:13.280]  I know it's disgusting,
[09:13.280 --> 09:16.120]  but just pour all that fucking reclaim right down the drain and get rid of it.
[09:16.120 --> 09:18.080]  You don't want that. I know a lot of people that use it.
[09:18.080 --> 09:20.320]  I'm not going to hate on you if you do. I wouldn't use it,
[09:20.320 --> 09:22.040]  especially if you just mix alcohol into it,
[09:22.400 --> 09:24.360]  but flush that shit right down the drain,
[09:24.360 --> 09:27.440]  get rid of it and then rinse the rig out a couple of times with super hot water.
[09:27.640 --> 09:31.040]  Let it dry. Let it cool down to a normal temp. Fill it back up with water,
[09:31.040 --> 09:34.280]  the right, uh, depth. What is that? A right amount of water, whatever,
[09:34.280 --> 09:35.120]  the right level,
[09:35.200 --> 09:37.200]  throw your nail on there and get down on some clean,
[09:37.200 --> 09:39.680]  tasty dabs and enjoy the flavor of your dabs. Again,
[09:39.680 --> 09:44.080]  I really think a clean rig is more important than people realize. All right,
[09:44.120 --> 09:46.640]  that's enough of that PSA. I've got more shit written down here.
[09:47.520 --> 09:50.840]  What else is next? Um, somebody was asking me,
[09:50.840 --> 09:52.400]  I got an email or a Facebook message.
[09:52.400 --> 09:54.080]  I cannot recall where it came from right now,
[09:54.080 --> 09:58.480]  but somebody was asking me about rig selection. How do I choose a good rig?
[09:59.480 --> 10:02.440]  Personally, if you're dabbing, uh,
[10:02.440 --> 10:04.960]  I prefer a small rig over a big piece.
[10:05.040 --> 10:09.160]  The reason we used to smoke pot out of a giant bong is so that you can fill all
[10:09.160 --> 10:12.240]  that space with a big, thick, chunky hit of smoke.
[10:12.440 --> 10:15.080]  And then when you pull that carb or you pull the bowl out or you take your
[10:15.080 --> 10:18.320]  finger off, however you carve your bowl, your bong, if you're from the seventies,
[10:18.320 --> 10:21.040]  you just take your finger off that hole in the back. If you're from the future,
[10:21.040 --> 10:22.920]  you got to pull the stem out. When you carve it,
[10:22.920 --> 10:26.080]  you're supposed to get all that fucking smoke into your lungs right at once.
[10:26.120 --> 10:28.200]  Boom. You just got a big old bong hit.
[10:28.240 --> 10:30.520]  And that's why you get baked from the bong. That's the purpose.
[10:30.800 --> 10:35.040]  Fill that piece, clear it, get all your smoke. When we're smoking dabs,
[10:36.200 --> 10:38.760]  your dab is just burning up right when you put it on the nail and you start
[10:38.760 --> 10:42.520]  smoking and you're getting it. I don't think we need a big ass piece for a dab.
[10:42.520 --> 10:45.040]  I like a little tiny rig tour. When you put it on there,
[10:45.080 --> 10:49.280]  you put the carb cap on there, you inhale, you get that smoke right to your face.
[10:49.800 --> 10:53.560]  We're not trying to build a whole bunch of smoke into one chamber and then clear
[10:53.560 --> 10:55.600]  it. We just want that dab to go through the rig,
[10:55.600 --> 10:58.080]  through the water to cool and then into your face.
[10:58.960 --> 11:02.720]  So my main recommendation is something kind of small, my favorite rig.
[11:02.760 --> 11:05.960]  And you're going to think I'm crazy, but my favorite rig is my hit man sidecar.
[11:06.200 --> 11:10.080]  It's just the right height. I'm thinking that's probably five inches tall,
[11:10.520 --> 11:12.760]  something like that. If you go up to the mouthpiece,
[11:12.760 --> 11:17.560]  it's probably seven inches tall. Um, it's a little rig. I like my mad Rob rig.
[11:17.600 --> 11:20.920]  That sucker is probably four inches tall at the most. Um,
[11:21.200 --> 11:24.240]  you don't need a lot of percolation on a rig. Uh,
[11:24.280 --> 11:26.680]  if you've got something that gets plenty of bubbles,
[11:26.800 --> 11:30.120]  you don't need a lot of diffusion. All you want to do is call a cool,
[11:30.160 --> 11:30.880]  your dab smoke.
[11:30.880 --> 11:33.800]  You don't want it coming off of that hot nail directly into your lungs.
[11:33.800 --> 11:36.040]  So you put a little water through there just enough to cool it.
[11:36.440 --> 11:38.600]  Like I don't like a lot of water on my rig.
[11:39.080 --> 11:41.640]  And also I think over percolation on a dab,
[11:41.640 --> 11:45.640]  like if you've got too many sections of water, you're kind of overdoing it.
[11:45.640 --> 11:48.240]  I like the Toro cans that have the tree perk.
[11:48.320 --> 11:51.320]  And then it's got the little showerhead perk in the middle. Those are great.
[11:51.360 --> 11:56.200]  But my favorite is the hit man. I really do like the mothership rigs.
[11:56.200 --> 11:59.920]  Those things hit like a boss, but you're looking at like 2,500 to 3,000 for a rig.
[11:59.920 --> 12:03.760]  If you're asking me for advice, you don't need advice on a mothership. Uh,
[12:04.160 --> 12:06.960]  get yourself a nice hit man rig. Don't be afraid of, uh,
[12:07.320 --> 12:09.200]  you don't have to buy name brand glass.
[12:09.560 --> 12:11.920]  Just keep in mind that if you're buying Chinese made glass,
[12:11.920 --> 12:15.680]  there's probably some Chinese little kid making it in unsafe conditions.
[12:15.680 --> 12:19.440]  They don't have good eye protection. They're probably barefoot. Just try to,
[12:19.480 --> 12:21.560]  or you can buy some American glass and do that.
[12:22.360 --> 12:26.760]  It's worth the extra few bucks just to know that you have ethically made glass.
[12:26.760 --> 12:30.280]  I think it's some karma. Uh, like I said, hit man's a good company.
[12:30.280 --> 12:32.760]  They don't support the show or anything, but they're always innovators.
[12:32.920 --> 12:36.120]  They lead the glass game. In my opinion, if you want to go expensive,
[12:36.120 --> 12:39.600]  get yourself a, a coil or some beer glass or something like that.
[12:39.600 --> 12:41.040]  Coil is going to be ridiculous. You guys,
[12:41.240 --> 12:44.760]  I'm just talking about my favorite rigs here. One thing I'm going to mention,
[12:45.200 --> 12:48.120]  so we get a small rig without a lot of percolation, uh,
[12:48.120 --> 12:50.440]  something that keeps the nail a little bit away from your face.
[12:50.480 --> 12:52.280]  When you're checking out these rigs at the store,
[12:52.560 --> 12:54.800]  try to put the nail that you're going to buy right on that rig.
[12:55.320 --> 12:58.360]  And then see how far away that nail is from your face.
[12:58.360 --> 13:02.680]  Cause I don't really like the nail higher than the mouthpiece or real right in
[13:02.680 --> 13:03.080]  my face.
[13:03.080 --> 13:06.400]  I needed a couple inches away from my nose so that I can see where I'm putting
[13:06.400 --> 13:10.600]  the dab. I don't want to go cross side. All right. The important part,
[13:10.600 --> 13:14.120]  the most important part when you're buying a rig is the nail.
[13:14.440 --> 13:17.120]  That's what you're heating up to a couple hundred degrees.
[13:17.120 --> 13:18.720]  That's what you're putting your extract on.
[13:18.800 --> 13:22.200]  It's going to be heated and cooled and heated and cooled all the time. Oh,
[13:22.200 --> 13:24.360]  excuse me. I'm burping here. I'm going to take a drink right quick. Excuse me.
[13:31.680 --> 13:34.400]  All right. I apologize for the silence. I needed a drink. Um,
[13:34.560 --> 13:36.760]  so get a good quality titanium nail.
[13:36.760 --> 13:41.520]  The only brand I will recommend for titanium is highly educated titanium.
[13:41.560 --> 13:44.320]  They make a nail for your rig. No matter what you're trying to do,
[13:44.600 --> 13:48.120]  highly educated has got the perfect nail for you. I promise.
[13:48.400 --> 13:51.320]  If you need guidance on the nail, hit me up, send me a picture of your rig.
[13:51.680 --> 13:55.040]  I'll tell you what kind of nail to buy. Um,
[13:55.320 --> 13:59.800]  I do really like the quartz nails. If you get a good quality quartz nail,
[14:00.320 --> 14:03.840]  I recommend the Halen honey hole. If you do big fat dabs,
[14:03.920 --> 14:06.360]  if you're into smoking solvent lists and to be a show,
[14:06.400 --> 14:07.600]  definitely get the honey hole.
[14:08.080 --> 14:10.080]  It holds a lot of heat for when you smoke solvent lists.
[14:10.080 --> 14:12.680]  It's got a lot of room to get a big solvent list dab in there.
[14:13.360 --> 14:16.120]  I also like the quave banger. Um,
[14:16.280 --> 14:19.360]  the quave banger is going to be a little bit pricey, but they are awesome.
[14:19.440 --> 14:22.840]  They taste super clean. Uh, who just made the trough?
[14:22.880 --> 14:24.680]  Was that Joel Halen that just made the trough?
[14:24.720 --> 14:27.960]  I've not had a chance to try the trough yet, but they look amazing.
[14:28.280 --> 14:29.920]  If it's made out of good quality courts,
[14:30.320 --> 14:33.800]  I bet it's going to be a good quartz banger. Uh,
[14:33.840 --> 14:37.600]  there is a company that is selling, uh, they call them quartz bangers.
[14:37.600 --> 14:39.120]  It's the nail that, uh, it's courts.
[14:39.140 --> 14:42.040]  It looks like a faucet spout kind of with a little bucket at the end of it.
[14:42.360 --> 14:45.320]  You put your dab in the bucket part. Um, guys,
[14:45.320 --> 14:48.000]  there's a company that's selling those that's claiming their courts and their
[14:48.000 --> 14:49.320]  glass. Be careful.
[14:49.400 --> 14:52.160]  You don't want to buy glass and reheat it and let it cool and reheat it and let
[14:52.160 --> 14:54.080]  it cool. It's going to break. You want a good courts piece.
[14:54.100 --> 14:57.000]  Courts can handle the shit. Also,
[14:57.000 --> 14:59.200]  we go back to that stuff talking about what's made in America,
[14:59.200 --> 15:03.120]  what's made in China. Try to do that with your courts products. Also, uh,
[15:03.160 --> 15:05.400]  get a Halen honey hole, get a real quave banger,
[15:05.600 --> 15:08.440]  or get yourself a real highly educated titanium nail.
[15:08.600 --> 15:12.320]  Those are the only nails I will support on this show. So come on guys,
[15:12.320 --> 15:14.400]  send me some nails. Not really. I'm just kidding.
[15:14.420 --> 15:18.320]  I've got all the nails I can use right now. Uh, so good nail is key.
[15:18.440 --> 15:19.280]  That's the point here.
[15:19.640 --> 15:23.080]  Also recently I discovered something that the people in Colorado may be excited
[15:23.080 --> 15:25.080]  about occasionally, uh,
[15:25.120 --> 15:30.120]  a kind love in Denver has occasionally been putting out clones of my lemon
[15:30.240 --> 15:34.360]  Jeffrey. They were, uh, they actually bought seeds from me at an event.
[15:34.380 --> 15:37.640]  They bought several packages of seeds and they ran the lemon Jeffrey and they
[15:37.660 --> 15:41.520]  found their phenotypes that are killer. I've seen the lab tests. Uh,
[15:41.520 --> 15:43.840]  they've tested from the 24 to 26 is,
[15:44.280 --> 15:46.440]  and they actually said that they could have grown the herb better,
[15:46.460 --> 15:47.280]  but there was an issue.
[15:47.280 --> 15:51.360]  So that means that next time you're going to see 28 to 29% on the lemon Jeffrey
[15:51.360 --> 15:52.200]  from kind love.
[15:52.720 --> 15:56.800]  So occasionally you can pick up lemon Jeffrey clones at kind love and they are
[15:56.800 --> 16:00.240]  beautiful. I've seen pictures of them. They're big, fat, healthy, luscious clones.
[16:00.440 --> 16:03.560]  I definitely recommend that call before you drive. Uh,
[16:03.580 --> 16:05.880]  they will not reserve a clone for you. So you have to call,
[16:05.960 --> 16:08.360]  you have to say, do they have this clone? And if they say yes,
[16:08.380 --> 16:10.920]  then you got to get in the car and haul ass over there because they will not
[16:10.920 --> 16:15.000]  reserve a clone for you, but they might have it. All right.
[16:15.000 --> 16:18.160]  I feel like I'm talking a million miles an hour. Um, I'm going to press pause,
[16:18.160 --> 16:22.000]  take a dab, and then we're going to get into some news. I'll be right back guys.
[16:22.560 --> 16:25.480]  The organic portions of this episode were sponsored by my friends at the Rocky
[16:25.480 --> 16:26.320]  Mountain Worm Company.
[16:26.320 --> 16:29.520]  Visit the Rocky Mountain Worm Company in Colorado Springs for fresh worm castings,
[16:29.520 --> 16:32.600]  African night crawlers, red wigglers, and all of your soil amendments.

[16:36.060 --> 16:38.960]  now. The Rocky Mountain Worm Company will ship to your door.
[16:39.000 --> 16:41.000]  You can get the same worm castings that I use.
[16:41.200 --> 16:44.520]  Plus many of the same amendments I use in my garden through Rocky Mountain
[16:44.520 --> 16:46.600]  Worm Company.com. Check that out today.
[16:49.680 --> 16:50.520]  All right guys, I'm back.
[16:50.520 --> 16:52.200]  I want to give a huge shout out to Taskin Linus.
[16:52.200 --> 16:54.480]  Thanks for letting me use the music on the show guys. Um,
[16:54.480 --> 16:57.680]  so I want to talk about some news, like I said, but to lead into the news,
[16:57.920 --> 17:01.960]  I want to talk a little bit about a comedy show that I went to recently. Uh,
[17:01.980 --> 17:06.240]  Clint and I were bragging that we got to go see the taping of Doug loves movies,
[17:06.240 --> 17:10.640]  which is one of my favorite podcasts. Uh, Doug Benson is a weed comedian.
[17:10.640 --> 17:14.000]  He does a show called Doug loves movies where they play games. Uh,
[17:14.040 --> 17:16.400]  he usually brings three, uh,
[17:16.680 --> 17:20.160]  comedians or some level of superstars to the show with him and they are his
[17:20.200 --> 17:24.320]  contestants and they play for the audience and the audience will win the prizes
[17:24.320 --> 17:25.640]  based on who wins in the crowd.
[17:26.480 --> 17:30.040]  So Doug loves movies came to comedy works in downtown Denver.
[17:30.040 --> 17:32.640]  You guys know how much I love comedy works. Big shout out to Baker,
[17:32.960 --> 17:35.360]  big shout out to comedy works, big shout out to the entire crew there.
[17:37.000 --> 17:41.480]  Excuse me for that giant cough. I felt that coming. So, uh, Clint and I,
[17:41.640 --> 17:42.600]  actually shout out to Clint.
[17:42.600 --> 17:45.640]  Clint drove me up there because like I said, my transmission is fucked.
[17:45.680 --> 17:48.960]  So Clint drove us up there and got us to the mellow mushroom.
[17:48.960 --> 17:52.480]  Shout out to the mushroom. They always feed us. Well, uh, got us to comedy works.
[17:52.480 --> 17:54.840]  We got to see the show. Um,
[17:55.160 --> 17:58.360]  we talked about Doug's last show not being up to standards.
[17:58.600 --> 18:01.920]  This time we laughed our asses off. He completely,
[18:02.080 --> 18:04.800]  completely made up for the lack of funny in the last show.
[18:05.960 --> 18:08.200]  So I'm catching my breath after that cough. I apologize.
[18:10.920 --> 18:14.280]  It took some pretty gnarly dabs while we were off there. They're Oh yeah.
[18:14.320 --> 18:16.400]  Well you guys were listening to that commercial about the worm company.
[18:16.400 --> 18:19.640]  Thanks for that. All right. I really am going to read this article here.
[18:19.640 --> 18:23.160]  I'm just trying to catch my breath before I do it. You guys. Um, Doug Benson,
[18:23.160 --> 18:25.640]  he pulled off a great show, a great podcast.
[18:25.640 --> 18:29.960]  You can listen to the exact episode. If you go to a iTunes search for Doug Benson,
[18:29.960 --> 18:34.200]  it's Doug loves movies. The episode actually is titled something about,
[18:34.200 --> 18:36.440]  I'm going to look at my phone right here just so that I can tell you accurately
[18:36.440 --> 18:40.600]  what it is. We're going there. Got this iPhone takes a second.
[18:40.680 --> 18:45.040]  It is holy crap. He does a lot of episodes, bro. It's titled Jeff Tate,
[18:45.040 --> 18:49.560]  Julian McCullough and Ricardo Baca guest. And it was a put up on Monday.
[18:49.960 --> 18:52.840]  So check that out if you want to, you guys, I was sitting in the front row.
[18:52.880 --> 18:58.000]  Shout out to my friends at comedy works. Uh, I, I owe somebody an apology.
[18:58.040 --> 19:00.360]  Well, I got to fix that sound equipment. I got this shit spiked up.
[19:00.360 --> 19:04.920]  I owe somebody an apology at comedy works, a patron. I was, uh,
[19:05.760 --> 19:07.720]  gifted the,
[19:08.240 --> 19:12.760]  the luxury of kind of a lifetime VI pass for comedy were a VIP pass for comedy
[19:12.760 --> 19:16.560]  works. As long as I call ahead and let my friend know that I'm coming,
[19:17.240 --> 19:19.920]  I can get a VIP seat in the front row.
[19:20.360 --> 19:21.680]  Let them know how many of us there will be.
[19:21.680 --> 19:23.760]  And they'll put me in the front row as long as I've got tickets.
[19:24.320 --> 19:27.840]  So I called ahead. I made arrangements to have my front row privileges.
[19:28.160 --> 19:33.160]  I was told that's cool. Uh, we got to the club and when it was time to seat us,
[19:33.760 --> 19:36.920]  the seating people kind of looked at each other with some concern.
[19:37.600 --> 19:42.160]  And the one guy said, you fucked up, you go tell him. So the one seating person,
[19:42.160 --> 19:43.640]  I don't know what he's called. I'm going to call him an usher.
[19:43.680 --> 19:44.520]  That sounds about right.
[19:44.520 --> 19:48.880]  But the one usher dude had to go tell two people that they had to move because
[19:48.880 --> 19:53.160]  the seats that they were sitting in upfront had been reserved for Doug's VIP
[19:53.160 --> 19:55.400]  special guests. Um,
[19:55.640 --> 19:59.640]  I felt bad for that because those people probably waited in line for a good hour
[19:59.640 --> 20:03.800]  while I was at the mellow mushroom eating pizza or in the car taking fat dabs.
[20:04.560 --> 20:07.280]  Um, well, I'm thinking about it. Shout out to Claude, the candy man.
[20:07.400 --> 20:10.560]  I ate a sweet stone candy, a Claudie bear before I went into the show,
[20:10.560 --> 20:13.760]  about two hours before the show and by showtime, Woo.
[20:13.760 --> 20:15.840]  I was sweet stoned for sure.
[20:16.120 --> 20:20.600]  So they had to go and move these two people because I've got this VIP pass.
[20:21.240 --> 20:25.440]  So they sit Clinton and I in the most prime fucking seats in the club right up
[20:25.440 --> 20:28.200]  front. And it's kind of awkward. I could feel hatred.
[20:28.240 --> 20:31.880]  People were staring at us like we were huge dicks. Um,
[20:32.040 --> 20:34.800]  and then eventually the guy sitting next to us got tired of the tension and he
[20:34.800 --> 20:39.120]  just said, so who the fuck are you guys? And Clint said, nobody, I'm with him.
[20:39.120 --> 20:40.440]  And they're like, who are you? And I was like,
[20:40.440 --> 20:42.120]  we're just friends of Doug's and they said, yeah,
[20:42.120 --> 20:45.280]  they moved our friends because you guys are Doug's special guests.
[20:45.880 --> 20:48.880]  And I felt kind of like a shithead for that. So I do apologize,
[20:49.240 --> 20:52.760]  but I had a great ass time up front. That was a good ass show. Um,
[20:52.800 --> 20:54.040]  let's go and read this article.
[20:54.040 --> 20:57.040]  I've been talking for a long time about it and I've just got an article written.
[20:57.480 --> 21:01.320]  Um, I was excited because what Doug does, dude,
[21:01.320 --> 21:02.920]  excuse all the coughing and throat clearing.
[21:02.920 --> 21:04.840]  I just took some gnarly dabs of some gorilla glue.
[21:05.840 --> 21:09.160]  Hopefully that was the last one of those. Not the, not the dab,
[21:09.160 --> 21:10.680]  the throat clearing. Uh,
[21:10.840 --> 21:14.520]  I was excited because when he announced his guests, he said Ricardo Baca.
[21:14.560 --> 21:16.080]  And I knew who that was right away.
[21:16.080 --> 21:19.120]  And a lot of our news on this show is written by Ricardo Baca.
[21:19.520 --> 21:21.640]  So this says comedia podcast,
[21:21.640 --> 21:24.800]  listen to marijuana editor Ricardo Baca on Doug loves movies.
[21:25.040 --> 21:29.040]  Comedians Jeff Tate and Julian McCullough join weed editor Ricardo Baca on Doug
[21:29.040 --> 21:31.720]  Benson's popular movie podcast. Of course,
[21:31.720 --> 21:36.040]  this came out May 11th and it was in the cannabis it's written by Ricardo Baca.
[21:36.840 --> 21:37.680]  It says,
[21:37.680 --> 21:41.640]  talk about nerves as as 4 20 PM Denver time approached on May 10th,
[21:41.680 --> 21:42.720]  AKA mother's day.
[21:43.040 --> 21:47.080]  I was sitting in comedy comedy works green room with some insanely talented
[21:47.080 --> 21:47.920]  standup comics,
[21:47.920 --> 21:51.800]  getting ready to take the stage for a taping of my single favorite podcast in
[21:51.800 --> 21:54.080]  the world. Comic Doug Benson,
[21:54.120 --> 21:58.800]  also a legit weed hero had generously asked me to be a guest on his movie
[21:58.800 --> 21:59.480]  podcast.
[21:59.480 --> 22:03.280]  Doug loves movies after seeing the marijuana journalism documentary rolling
[22:03.280 --> 22:07.000]  papers at the South by Southwest film festival. Too fun.
[22:07.360 --> 22:10.560]  I'm going to jump in right here. I mentioned rolling papers, a movie,
[22:11.120 --> 22:14.400]  a camera crew followed. Um, what's his name?
[22:14.400 --> 22:18.840]  Ricardo Baca around for a year and followed members of his staff and part of the
[22:18.840 --> 22:19.360]  newspaper.
[22:19.360 --> 22:23.760]  They followed him for an entire year and recorded and made a documentary about
[22:24.080 --> 22:28.520]  the journalism, marijuana journalism that is developed in Colorado.
[22:28.520 --> 22:31.320]  And they've dubbed the movie rolling papers. Um,
[22:31.400 --> 22:35.760]  it was purchased after its first showing at the South by Southwest festival.
[22:35.760 --> 22:38.720]  So that's coming out in the future. Um, I'll keep you guys updated when that
[22:38.720 --> 22:39.540]  comes out.
[22:41.040 --> 22:44.040]  Excuse all the coughing. I apologize. It's a weed show. You get it.
[22:44.680 --> 22:47.640]  I hope you're coughing with me. Uh, then the article goes on to say,
[22:47.640 --> 22:51.360]  and then the nerves came on. Lots of people listen to this, I thought,
[22:51.360 --> 22:53.400]  but after my mean, after meeting my fellow guests,
[22:53.400 --> 22:57.280]  whips mark comedians, Jeff Tate and Julian McCullough and seeing Benson again,
[22:57.480 --> 23:00.920]  I knew we were in for a good time. The podcast taping was a blast.
[23:00.960 --> 23:03.600]  The sold out crow crowd at comedy works was super rad.
[23:03.880 --> 23:06.680]  And Benson's team took less than 24 hours to launch it.
[23:06.720 --> 23:10.920]  And he means the podcast and now everyone can listen via the embedded, uh,
[23:10.960 --> 23:13.360]  Doug loves movie site or iTunes. So yeah,
[23:13.360 --> 23:17.360]  if you go to Doug loves movies.com or go to iTunes, you can listen to it.
[23:17.360 --> 23:18.960]  It was a great, great podcast.
[23:20.920 --> 23:25.120]  Ricardo Baca did quite damn well. He was on stage with three, uh,
[23:25.600 --> 23:28.840]  witty top level comedians and he held his own.
[23:29.000 --> 23:31.400]  He did not try to step up and be a comedian.
[23:31.600 --> 23:34.320]  He remained Ricardo Baca and I respected him for that.
[23:34.320 --> 23:38.080]  He let the comedians comedy and he did his job and was the person that they
[23:38.080 --> 23:41.520]  invited. You guys, my throat is tickly. I'm going to press pause for a second.
[23:41.520 --> 23:44.360]  And I'll be right back with another news article. Excuse me. And I apologize.
[23:45.520 --> 23:47.640]  Oh my gosh. You guys wouldn't believe what I just spit up.
[23:47.680 --> 23:49.760]  I should've took a picture of that for you, man.
[23:49.840 --> 23:52.240]  I should've recorded the sound of that hitting wherever it landed.
[23:53.040 --> 23:56.600]  Oh, that was thick. Um, here's a side note on the cannabis.
[23:56.640 --> 23:59.320]  The strain of the day is golden goat. That's cool.
[23:59.360 --> 24:01.640]  People often credit me for making the golden goat.
[24:01.640 --> 24:03.160]  I did not invent the golden goat.
[24:03.200 --> 24:06.760]  I simply put it into Feminized Seed for the world to enjoy. Uh,
[24:06.800 --> 24:11.720]  golden goat was created by Mr. Dank in Topeka, Kansas. Shout out Mr. Dank.
[24:12.600 --> 24:14.680]  Oh, I'm catching my breath. I'm sure you can hear that a little bit,
[24:15.880 --> 24:17.480]  but we are going to read another news article.
[24:17.600 --> 24:20.800]  I'm going to fix some recording equipment. I'm blowing some shit up. Um,
[24:20.800 --> 24:23.320]  I've got the air conditioner next to me and I don't think you guys can hear it,
[24:23.320 --> 24:24.080]  but the, uh,
[24:24.080 --> 24:27.400]  the recording equipment is struggling to keep me in this fucking air conditioner
[24:27.440 --> 24:29.920]  separate than recording here. It's pretty neat watching the lights light up.
[24:30.600 --> 24:35.560]  Anyway, this one hits close to home because I do live in Pueblo, Colorado. Uh,
[24:35.560 --> 24:39.560]  I am actually the grower at a very popular dispensary in Pueblo West,
[24:39.560 --> 24:43.320]  Colorado. Uh, Pueblo West is like a sub, uh,
[24:43.360 --> 24:45.600]  development just outside of the city of Pueblo.
[24:45.600 --> 24:48.320]  It's about 10 minutes to the West. Obviously it's Pueblo West.
[24:48.840 --> 24:52.000]  It's a little nicer. Uh, well, I don't know that it's exactly complete,
[24:52.000 --> 24:54.040]  a little completely a little nicer. It's newer,
[24:54.080 --> 24:55.920]  so it doesn't have old town problems.
[24:56.520 --> 25:00.800]  It doesn't have the old rickety parts of town, so it looks a lot nicer. Uh,
[25:00.840 --> 25:02.520]  we also have a part that we call the County,
[25:02.600 --> 25:04.360]  which if you drive outside of city limits,
[25:04.360 --> 25:08.960]  there are a lot of stores and shopping areas in the County and the County and
[25:08.960 --> 25:12.920]  Pueblo West are allowed to have dispensaries, but the city of Pueblo,
[25:14.000 --> 25:15.800]  um, has not been allowed dispensaries.
[25:16.720 --> 25:20.640]  I'm going to read an article that came out May 12th. Dude,
[25:20.640 --> 25:23.640]  I really do apologize for this throat. Uh, I just took some gnarly dabs.
[25:23.640 --> 25:27.280]  I'll quit taking so many dabs on the show so that you guys can hear me also
[25:27.360 --> 25:28.880]  come be on the show. Talk to me,
[25:28.880 --> 25:31.920]  talk while I'm clear in my throat and you guys can give me a break. Uh,
[25:31.960 --> 25:33.640]  this article says Pueblo pot shops,
[25:33.680 --> 25:36.760]  voters will decide whether to allow retail sales in November.
[25:37.160 --> 25:40.960]  It's only by the AP is who gets credit for this Pueblo. Uh,
[25:40.960 --> 25:44.640]  Pueblo lawmakers are letting the voters decide whether to allow recreational
[25:44.640 --> 25:46.160]  marijuana shops in their city.
[25:46.680 --> 25:49.760]  The Pueblo chieftain reports concerned residents filled the city council
[25:49.760 --> 25:50.720]  chambers Monday night,
[25:51.040 --> 25:54.600]  many wearing yellow shirts that said voice your choice and urging their elected
[25:54.600 --> 25:56.840]  officials to put the issue to voters.
[25:58.240 --> 26:01.840]  Councilman Bob Schilling was the only vote in favor of licensing retail pot
[26:01.840 --> 26:05.040]  shops, but said that he hasn't opposed a vote in November.
[26:05.520 --> 26:08.880]  Several of the six council members who voted against adopting the ordinance had
[26:08.880 --> 26:12.680]  been in favor before the public hearing, including president Stephen Iraqi,
[26:12.680 --> 26:15.600]  excuse me guys, I'm sorry. He said there isn't a,
[26:15.600 --> 26:19.000]  the issue isn't worth dividing the public over. Uh,
[26:19.000 --> 26:23.080]  they did vote and uh, they did decide to push back the vote.
[26:23.080 --> 26:28.080]  There will be no recreational or medical marijuana shops in the city of Pueblo,
[26:28.800 --> 26:33.320]  uh, until they vote again, which will be in November. So you guys,
[26:33.320 --> 26:34.200]  if you live in Pueblo,
[26:34.760 --> 26:39.360]  you have to drive 15 minutes to the County or to Pueblo West to go purchase your
[26:39.360 --> 26:41.080]  cannabis and then drive back.
[26:41.600 --> 26:45.080]  And then the city that you live in isn't getting your tax money for the cannabis
[26:45.080 --> 26:49.320]  that you're able to purchase because of these stupid fucking regulations that
[26:49.320 --> 26:50.640]  Pueblo has been juggling with.
[26:52.320 --> 26:56.720]  I've been in the legal medical marijuana industry in this city, uh, since,
[26:57.160 --> 26:58.160]  should we had the first shop?
[26:58.160 --> 27:01.040]  I think that was nine years ago when we had met Amar downtown.
[27:01.720 --> 27:03.360]  And since that is closed, uh,
[27:03.360 --> 27:06.720]  there has not been another medical shop or a recreational shop in the city that
[27:06.720 --> 27:07.680]  was legally licensed.
[27:07.680 --> 27:09.960]  There've been places that popped up randomly and were closed,
[27:10.480 --> 27:14.120]  but I think it's kind of retarded. I shouldn't use the word retarded.
[27:14.120 --> 27:15.440]  That's mean to the retarded people.
[27:15.460 --> 27:19.280]  I think it's ridiculous and stupid that we are not allowed to have a recreational
[27:19.280 --> 27:23.400]  cannabis shop within city limits. They need the tax money.
[27:23.440 --> 27:27.680]  This town is broke and hurting a bunch of weed money would really help this city.
[27:28.680 --> 27:31.600]  All right. Um, here's another news article that I found interesting.
[27:31.600 --> 27:36.160]  It says Castle Rock man pleads guilty to mailing Colorado pot across the country.
[27:36.160 --> 27:38.560]  This one is written by Anthony cotton of the Denver post.
[27:38.560 --> 27:41.640]  It was published May 12th and here's, you're going to,
[27:41.760 --> 27:44.920]  you're going to catch on right away. My point, when I start reading this,
[27:44.920 --> 27:48.960]  it says a Castle Rock man pleaded guilty on charges that included sending more
[27:48.960 --> 27:52.600]  than a hundred packages that included marijuana to locations across the country
[27:52.960 --> 27:56.960]  and receiving several hundred thousand dollars through the mail and return.
[27:57.840 --> 28:01.680]  According to the, according to the United States district attorney's office,
[28:01.680 --> 28:02.960]  Brian Daniel Evans,
[28:02.960 --> 28:07.960]  age 42 began mailing pot packages in April of 2014 and continued through that
[28:08.320 --> 28:10.840]  fall. Evans pleaded guilty this April.
[28:11.120 --> 28:14.160]  Officials said Evans first came under suspicion on April 2nd,
[28:14.160 --> 28:18.440]  2014 when a us postal inspector came across a suspicious mailing that may have
[28:18.460 --> 28:20.680]  contained narcotics or narcotic proceeds.
[28:20.920 --> 28:24.200]  The first package in question came from Missouri and it contained cash.
[28:25.240 --> 28:28.880]  That package was sent to a commercial mail receiving agency mailbox and was
[28:28.920 --> 28:31.320]  addressed to an individual in lone tree.
[28:31.760 --> 28:35.800]  An ongoing investigation traced a car under surveillance to Evans who was also
[28:35.800 --> 28:38.800]  seen mailing parcels from post offices in the Metro area.
[28:39.240 --> 28:41.480]  Officials said inspectors also conducted search,
[28:41.720 --> 28:44.400]  a search of Elvin's apartment that, uh,
[28:44.420 --> 28:47.360]  that search recovered 580 grams of bagged marijuana,
[28:47.360 --> 28:51.760]  800 grams of marijuana extract or hash oil. Wow. That's a lot of hash oil, bro.
[28:51.760 --> 28:53.960]  That's close to two pounds. Um,
[28:54.960 --> 28:59.960]  5,480 grams of marijuana edibles for a total weight of 6,860 grams of marijuana.
[29:02.400 --> 29:05.720]  Wait a minute. You guys heard that stupid shit in there, right? Uh,
[29:05.720 --> 29:08.440]  5,480 grams of marijuana edibles.
[29:08.920 --> 29:12.240]  They're fucking weighing the brownies and charging him with the weight of the
[29:12.240 --> 29:17.160]  fucking brownies for the grams of pot. That's fucking whack, bro.
[29:17.160 --> 29:20.760]  That is inaccurate. That's not cool. That's like when the baggy too,
[29:21.440 --> 29:25.280]  but you can't do that, man. You're a shitty drug dealer. That sucks.
[29:25.280 --> 29:28.440]  I that this whole article is fucked up. This guy should not have done that.
[29:28.440 --> 29:32.040]  But that part right there is wrong. Um, I'm going to continue the article.
[29:32.200 --> 29:35.800]  A search of his vehicle found an additional 78 grams of liquid marijuana.
[29:35.840 --> 29:38.000]  He probably had some tincture. You guys, uh,
[29:38.000 --> 29:41.000]  he had previously mailed two additional packages that were seized by law
[29:41.000 --> 29:45.920]  enforcement. Those packages contained 3,654 grams of marijuana.
[29:46.320 --> 29:51.280]  In total, inspectors learned that Elvin sent 11,026 grams of marijuana.
[29:51.760 --> 29:54.400]  Law enforcement also had seized during the investigation,
[29:54.400 --> 29:57.160]  more than $53,000 in cash,
[29:57.160 --> 30:00.520]  which was the proceed proceeds from his illegal narcotics transaction.
[30:00.920 --> 30:04.040]  That money was forfeited to the government as part of Elvin's plea agreement.
[30:04.560 --> 30:06.400]  Elvin's pled guilty to three accounts,
[30:06.400 --> 30:08.920]  three counts of possession of a controlled substance with the intent to
[30:08.920 --> 30:09.760]  distribute.
[30:09.800 --> 30:14.800]  He now faces more than 20 years in federal prison and up to a $1 million
[30:15.320 --> 30:16.920]  fine per count.
[30:17.560 --> 30:22.360]  So my point here people is quit mailing weed out of Colorado,
[30:22.520 --> 30:27.400]  unless you want to end up in federal prison doing 20 years and facing up to a
[30:27.400 --> 30:30.280]  $1 million in fines per count.
[30:30.760 --> 30:32.920]  There are several reasons we shouldn't be mailing cannabis out of the state.
[30:32.920 --> 30:33.760]  You guys,
[30:34.560 --> 30:37.440]  first off it's illegal and you're going to go to prison and you're going to get
[30:37.440 --> 30:41.000]  butt raped. Doesn't sound like fun to me. Doesn't sound like the fucking profit.
[30:41.000 --> 30:44.600]  I'm making from it. Not at all. Second of all, in Colorado,
[30:44.600 --> 30:48.920]  the people that have fought hard to legalize cannabis medically and
[30:48.920 --> 30:49.760]  recreationally,
[30:50.040 --> 30:53.880]  we did it for here and you're fucking it up by mailing it somewhere else.
[30:53.920 --> 30:55.800]  It's their response. Wherever you're sending it,
[30:56.080 --> 30:59.600]  they're responsible for legalizing cannabis in their area, not us.
[31:00.080 --> 31:03.040]  And by sending it out, you're fucking up what we worked hard for.
[31:03.360 --> 31:05.880]  We're making something shiny. We've got a system that works.
[31:05.880 --> 31:08.480]  We've created laws and we're playing by the rules.
[31:08.760 --> 31:11.840]  And then you're going to be a fucking shithead and take the rules that we've
[31:11.840 --> 31:14.120]  made. You can grow and smoke all the weeds you want.
[31:14.360 --> 31:16.960]  You can hustle weed in Colorado. Quit sending it out of state.
[31:17.000 --> 31:18.760]  You don't need to do that. That's fucking it up,
[31:18.760 --> 31:22.360]  making everybody look bad and you're going to get caught and get butt raped and
[31:22.360 --> 31:25.360]  go to jail. You get to be all, I'll read about you in the future.
[31:25.400 --> 31:26.320]  Keep sending that shit.
[31:26.320 --> 31:28.760]  I will proudly read your name and laugh at you on this show.
[31:29.480 --> 31:32.320]  Don't send cannabis out of state debt. That's fucking my point.
[31:32.320 --> 31:36.560]  You guys get it right. Legalize cannabis everywhere. Do your part.
[31:37.120 --> 31:39.600]  Contact your local Congress people. Go to city council meetings,
[31:39.600 --> 31:43.160]  do that shit where you are and get it legalized in your area so that you don't
[31:43.200 --> 31:45.680]  have to get, and there's not enough herb here. People are hurting for herb.
[31:45.680 --> 31:48.520]  There are patients that want cannabis that don't have any medicine here.
[31:48.800 --> 31:52.320]  And we're sending that shit to other States to make a profit. That's fucked up.
[31:52.520 --> 31:55.040]  Take the money out of cannabis. Put more compassion into cannabis.
[31:55.040 --> 31:59.000]  That's what I'm saying. All right. Yeah. What else do I have for you?
[31:59.400 --> 32:02.160]  We've gone 30 minutes. Let's uh, let's just chat for a minute.
[32:02.200 --> 32:05.320]  I have promised you a scheduling episode.
[32:05.400 --> 32:08.880]  I told you I was going to do an episode about scheduling your grow for a
[32:08.880 --> 32:12.400]  perpetual cycle. I am writing it, but I'm having an,
[32:12.440 --> 32:14.280]  I had an issue. I had a stumbling block.
[32:14.320 --> 32:15.840]  I don't know how many lights you have,
[32:15.960 --> 32:18.680]  so I don't know how to write a perpetual cycle for your room,
[32:19.000 --> 32:22.840]  but I have found a solution. So I'm writing it based on that. Uh,
[32:22.840 --> 32:26.720]  we'll get it together. That'll probably be one or two episodes away.
[32:28.400 --> 32:32.080]  Um, the other episode I have been teasing about is improving your gardens.
[32:32.080 --> 32:34.400]  I was going to say top 10 ways to improve your garden.
[32:34.400 --> 32:37.760]  I've got about 30 ways written down. That could be a long episode.
[32:38.080 --> 32:41.480]  That is definitely coming. Um,
[32:41.520 --> 32:44.000]  I don't want to talk too much about any of that stuff cause we'll just save it
[32:44.000 --> 32:47.120]  for the actual show. I want to give a huge shout out again to Clint and Baker.
[32:47.360 --> 32:49.400]  Also a big shout out to comedy works.
[32:49.680 --> 32:53.280]  Big shout out to everybody who has helped me deal with not having a car this
[32:53.280 --> 32:56.000]  week or this weekend. That's been a real pain in the ass. You guys,
[32:56.000 --> 32:58.800]  if we had some plans that I had to cancel or rearrange, I apologize.
[32:58.800 --> 33:02.560]  We've got a blown transmission. Uh, my chevrolet eggs will get me so far,
[33:02.560 --> 33:06.680]  but the weather has been shitty and uh, I'm stuck. So you gotta come to me.
[33:07.040 --> 33:09.200]  If you want to take some dabs or if you want to be on the podcast,
[33:09.200 --> 33:11.720]  you got to come to me. I'm going to wrap up the show. You guys,
[33:11.720 --> 33:15.360]  you pay a lot more attention to a 35, 40 minute episode than you do.
[33:15.360 --> 33:20.040]  Those hours shows. Let me know what you think. Um, yeah. Uh,
[33:20.080 --> 33:25.080]  go to a stitcher or iTunes or Twitter or Facebook or email me and tell me if you
[33:26.960 --> 33:31.160]  prefer the 30 minute episodes over the hour long episodes. Um,
[33:31.520 --> 33:35.280]  I think it's better when I do two 30 minute episodes instead of the long hour.
[33:35.320 --> 33:38.120]  And you guys really listen more. My throat doesn't fuck up as much.
[33:38.120 --> 33:40.960]  If we have a guest, we'll go an hour. But when it's just me,
[33:41.000 --> 33:43.560]  I'm going to try to go about 30 and try to do two episodes a week.
[33:44.040 --> 33:46.960]  It's better for everybody that way. In my opinion, let me know what you think.
[33:47.400 --> 33:51.280]  The show isn't just for me. The show is a lot for you. So, uh,
[33:51.300 --> 33:52.760]  thanks for listening to you guys. I'm going to wrap it up.
[33:52.960 --> 33:54.840]  I'll be back in a few days with another episode,
[33:54.840 --> 33:56.720]  probably about ways to improve your garden.
