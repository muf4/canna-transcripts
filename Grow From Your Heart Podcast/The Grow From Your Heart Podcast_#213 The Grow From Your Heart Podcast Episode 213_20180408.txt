[00:17.340 --> 00:19.540]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[00:19.540 --> 00:23.100]  It's time for episode number two 13 of the grow from your heart podcast,
[00:23.260 --> 00:27.300]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right.
[00:27.300 --> 00:29.260]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.500 --> 00:31.540]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:31.860 --> 00:34.940]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the
[00:34.940 --> 00:38.820]  current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:39.740 --> 00:41.620]  I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:41.660 --> 00:44.100]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me as always.
[00:44.100 --> 00:47.100]  I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the mystic roots
[00:47.100 --> 00:49.420]  band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:49.740 --> 00:53.700]  Big thanks to Kat Kuh and the entire mystic roots crew.
[00:56.060 --> 00:56.900]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:56.940 --> 00:59.940]  somebody who has not been here in a long time is back on the podcast.
[00:59.940 --> 01:02.780]  Welcome to the show. Our good friend, Kevin, welcome back, bro.
[01:02.860 --> 01:05.060]  What's up, man. Thanks for having me. I appreciate you.
[01:05.140 --> 01:05.900]  Thanks for swinging by.
[01:05.900 --> 01:07.980]  You said you wanted to come hang out and take some dabs and I was like, well,
[01:07.980 --> 01:08.700]  shit, if you're coming,
[01:08.700 --> 01:11.700]  we're going to put a microphone in your face and document this shit.
[01:11.940 --> 01:15.100]  That sounds good to me, dude. Let's uh, let's talk about some stuff.
[01:15.140 --> 01:16.780]  Nice. We'll do that. Before we get there,
[01:16.780 --> 01:19.820]  let's introduce Mike. What's up everybody. Mike's across the table.
[01:19.820 --> 01:22.460]  White Mike is joining us. Welcome back to the show, bro. Yeah, man.
[01:22.540 --> 01:23.180]  Thanks for having me.
[01:23.180 --> 01:26.540]  It seems like you were here just about 24 hours ago doing the same shit.
[01:26.620 --> 01:30.100]  Give or take not even that long. Right, right. You just left a midnight,
[01:30.220 --> 01:33.580]  left a run midnight and it's fucking seven. It's almost seven 10.
[01:33.580 --> 01:37.820]  So somewhere in this podcast, we will be taking some seven 10 dabs. Nice.
[01:37.900 --> 01:41.380]  Got a table covered in a high grade top shelf extracts.
[01:41.380 --> 01:43.060]  There's some golden goat shatter over here.
[01:43.260 --> 01:46.260]  We got some lemon Jeffrey high cannabinoid, full spectrum extracts,
[01:46.260 --> 01:49.260]  some lemon Jeffrey, high terpene. I said terpene.
[01:49.260 --> 01:53.220]  I've never said that high terpene,
[01:53.660 --> 01:57.900]  the high terpene full spectrum extract. Uh, Kevro brought some,
[01:57.940 --> 02:01.780]  what was that skunk Mary? Some lemons, some lemon skunk turf sauce.
[02:01.820 --> 02:05.380]  We got some CBD Ambrosia, uh,
[02:05.420 --> 02:09.700]  some Jack's Jeffrey number two. Uh, geez,
[02:09.700 --> 02:12.540]  I don't even, I think it's some libraries and something else.
[02:13.540 --> 02:18.540]  We got some sunshine for libraries and which is chem four and sunshine daydream.
[02:18.540 --> 02:21.900]  So we're going with some flavors right now. We've got a flavorful table full.
[02:21.940 --> 02:25.060]  Yes, indeed. I've got some, uh, what else do we got in there? We got the, uh,
[02:25.100 --> 02:27.860]  the arise shatter. We got some lemon skunk shatter.
[02:28.220 --> 02:30.060]  We got some grateful dog floating around here somewhere.
[02:30.100 --> 02:32.740]  Got some orange skunk shatter. There's some grateful dog shatter.
[02:33.380 --> 02:36.300]  There's a lot of, yeah, there's a bunch of tasty stuff available to dab on.
[02:36.300 --> 02:37.620]  There's some space bitch shatter.
[02:38.380 --> 02:41.100]  Shout out to my friend, the barefoot grower and barefoot extracts.
[02:41.140 --> 02:44.740]  Thanks for keeping me laced up with good shatter and to my friends at apothecary
[02:44.740 --> 02:49.740]  for keeping me laced up with super sweet live resins and brosias,
[02:50.180 --> 02:53.820]  full spectrum extracts, sugars, batters,
[02:54.660 --> 02:56.940]  the fucking full range of the best hash you could smoke.
[02:56.940 --> 02:59.620]  Sorry if you're not in a legal state, we don't mean to brag.
[02:59.660 --> 03:03.900]  We just need to brag the word we're spoiled hash brats and we fucking love it.
[03:05.340 --> 03:07.620]  It went quiet. Everyone just agreed and nodded. Yeah.
[03:08.580 --> 03:09.420]  Say about that.
[03:09.540 --> 03:10.860]  And right now we're all a little baked.
[03:12.700 --> 03:14.380]  Excuse me for the clearing of the throat.
[03:14.620 --> 03:19.220]  I just took an amazingly large dab once again of this a high terpene, uh,
[03:19.260 --> 03:23.460]  full spectrum extract and it puts you in another place.
[03:23.460 --> 03:25.460]  It makes you float around and make sure a little tingly.
[03:25.700 --> 03:29.620]  I really enjoyed the way that shit makes me feel. And for the price point,
[03:29.620 --> 03:31.180]  it's definitely worth it. All right.
[03:31.180 --> 03:34.020]  Kevin started his whole, uh, his welcoming to the show by saying,
[03:34.020 --> 03:36.100]  let's talk about some stuff. So bro, let's talk about some shit.
[03:36.100 --> 03:41.100]  Where are you been, man? Where have I been? Um, I don't know, man.
[03:41.460 --> 03:42.300]  I, uh,
[03:42.700 --> 03:47.300]  I had some of my own stuff going on and kind of dropped out of the scene a
[03:47.300 --> 03:48.940]  little bit and, uh,
[03:49.740 --> 03:53.060]  started rebuilding and getting back involved with the cannabis community,
[03:53.060 --> 03:55.940]  the music community, art community. Um,
[03:57.100 --> 04:00.100]  it's I missed a few things while I was kind of out.
[04:00.140 --> 04:03.180]  So it's kind of a catch up with all these,
[04:03.180 --> 04:08.180]  with all these new turf sauces and all these HTF SEs and HCF SEs,
[04:08.300 --> 04:11.620]  but it's, it's been a quick, a quick learning curve back.
[04:11.620 --> 04:15.380]  So started making some dirt for a little while doing some, uh,
[04:15.420 --> 04:18.740]  different soil applications and whatnot, custom, uh,
[04:18.780 --> 04:22.020]  custom soil applications for different cannabis growers,
[04:22.020 --> 04:25.540]  depending on how they wanted to grow and whatnot.
[04:25.540 --> 04:27.940]  We do some fresh batch mixes for them.
[04:28.020 --> 04:30.300]  You want to give your company, your soil company, a shout out while you're here.
[04:30.300 --> 04:32.340]  Unfortunately, I'm not with the company anymore,
[04:32.500 --> 04:34.780]  but I still do support their product. So, uh,
[04:34.820 --> 04:38.060]  CWC soil is a great place for a cannabis grower. Check them out.
[04:38.060 --> 04:42.260]  You guys see what they do for you. Look up, look them up online. CWC soil,
[04:42.260 --> 04:46.020]  Colorado weed company soil located here in Pueblo, Colorado. So, uh,
[04:46.020 --> 04:49.300]  you can get a custom soil with all your additives or whatever you need,
[04:49.420 --> 04:53.300]  whether it be hydro or live mix or soilless blend. So give them,
[04:53.500 --> 04:56.380]  give them a shout. Sweet. That's a good plug for him, bro. For sure.
[04:57.740 --> 05:00.140]  Everything going well. Yeah. Everything's going great, man.
[05:00.140 --> 05:03.940]  I got some, some cool opportunities rolling with, uh, some, uh,
[05:06.100 --> 05:09.540]  some new people in the industry. I saw you think about what you can say there.
[05:09.700 --> 05:13.060]  Can't say too much at the moment, but, uh, it's, it's,
[05:13.140 --> 05:15.740]  it's going to be exciting here in the next couple of months. Nice.
[05:15.820 --> 05:17.780]  I look forward to hearing about it on a future episode.
[05:17.780 --> 05:21.620]  You talk about it when it's more, uh, more. Yeah, definitely. We'll come share.
[05:21.660 --> 05:24.460]  Cool. We'll keep your secrets safe for sure, bro. Awesome. Mike,
[05:24.460 --> 05:27.140]  how you doing bro? You look high as fuck dude.
[05:27.460 --> 05:30.980]  That last stab put me in a special place. That's what I keep saying about this.
[05:32.700 --> 05:34.620]  Yeah. Well, there are always those shows when you're here.
[05:34.660 --> 05:37.820]  And then we brought Kev row. So it's definitely going to be one of those.
[05:38.140 --> 05:40.180]  It's a night bright uplifting high,
[05:40.180 --> 05:43.180]  which I haven't gotten out of some dabs in a little while.
[05:43.180 --> 05:47.300]  Everything's real heavy for me lately. Even the sativas tend to be, uh,
[05:48.300 --> 05:53.260]  just a little, not a sativa enough. Okay.
[05:53.380 --> 05:57.940]  I suppose. Yeah. So these are, it's a real crisp, clean, uplifting, bright high.
[05:57.980 --> 06:01.220]  It seems to me time go very quickly. Yeah. Yeah.
[06:01.300 --> 06:04.340]  Like time just travels when you smoke this stuff, you'll start a conversation.
[06:04.620 --> 06:07.980]  Oh shit. Breaks over. I gotta go. Like I gotta get back to work. I'm sorry.
[06:07.980 --> 06:12.100]  Hit me like, whoops. Yeah. It seems like it could be that for sure.
[06:12.100 --> 06:16.500]  So these are my first couple of hits of the lemon Jeffrey in particular.
[06:16.500 --> 06:20.500]  So that's, was that the first time you've tried the high cannabinoid full spectrum
[06:21.100 --> 06:25.220]  extracts? Uh, no, I've had a few of those. I've had a few of the HTF SES as well.
[06:25.700 --> 06:26.180]  Um,
[06:26.180 --> 06:31.180]  seems like each dispensary has a little bit different consistency and style of
[06:32.300 --> 06:35.340]  doing, doing it and still having the same label on it.
[06:35.340 --> 06:40.180]  So I'm still kind of trying to find where it's actually that product or someone's
[06:40.220 --> 06:45.220]  just kind of calling it that cause it's that, that new thing. So, um,
[06:45.820 --> 06:47.940]  still trying to find that, that balance there.
[06:48.420 --> 06:52.300]  I think, uh, there was a huge difference in the lemon Jeffrey,
[06:52.660 --> 06:56.420]  the star dog and the mob boss. And there was another one. I got the, uh,
[06:56.420 --> 06:59.300]  the high cannabinoid full spectrum extract just,
[06:59.300 --> 07:00.780]  and they were all from apothecary.
[07:01.140 --> 07:04.260]  Every one of them had a, had a huge difference in consistency.
[07:04.260 --> 07:07.980]  The lemon Jeff's got the largest crystals I've seen so far. Uh, that,
[07:08.100 --> 07:10.060]  I thought it was really neat when I busted that open,
[07:10.260 --> 07:12.060]  the mob boss was a little dustier.
[07:12.100 --> 07:15.700]  It just looked like real small crystals and the star dog was sticky.
[07:15.900 --> 07:18.860]  It's stuck to the dapper. This stuff will stick to the dapper for shit.
[07:18.900 --> 07:23.660]  I think a lot of that also would, would contribute. Uh, I could be wrong, but,
[07:23.860 --> 07:26.860]  um, what could contribute to that anyway is the, uh,
[07:28.100 --> 07:33.100]  the actual structure and crystal size of the oils themselves on the plant.
[07:33.460 --> 07:37.060]  Right. Yeah. It's all about the plant that's coming from your, um,
[07:37.500 --> 07:39.460]  your trichomes and things like that would,
[07:39.460 --> 07:42.780]  would all be kind of different structure and size on the plant itself.
[07:42.780 --> 07:47.340]  So it would make sense for the extract to kind of show some of that variance.
[07:47.420 --> 07:51.020]  And since they're an extract company, they're getting material from their grow.
[07:51.020 --> 07:53.940]  They're probably getting, but they get material from my grow at three rivers.
[07:54.140 --> 07:56.020]  They get material from altitude.
[07:56.340 --> 07:58.900]  So they're getting a whole bunch of different products to run.
[07:59.020 --> 08:01.100]  So you're going to see a lot of different, uh,
[08:01.100 --> 08:04.340]  textures and different size crystals and things like that.
[08:04.740 --> 08:08.620]  And then when they're also different extract companies running it,
[08:08.620 --> 08:12.300]  they probably have, there's an art. I would assume that at apothecary they have,
[08:12.300 --> 08:15.860]  I know there are at least two dudes making the high cannabinoid full spectrum
[08:15.860 --> 08:20.020]  extract. I'm sure each one of them has their own little, their one thing.
[08:20.820 --> 08:23.540]  It's not just science. It's an art form. And I'm sure they've got,
[08:23.940 --> 08:25.980]  so I'm sure if you go to a whole nother facility,
[08:26.820 --> 08:30.100]  they have a way another method. Right. So it's going to come out similar,
[08:30.100 --> 08:31.780]  but it's going to be art. It's like music. Yep.
[08:31.860 --> 08:33.340]  Like if you read the notes off the page,
[08:33.340 --> 08:34.700]  you and I are going to read the same notes.
[08:34.700 --> 08:36.260]  We're going to play it a little bit differently.
[08:37.700 --> 08:41.700]  Entirely. I totally agree with that. That makes total sense,
[08:41.700 --> 08:45.900]  especially with, um, extracts. Everyone's going to have their own little,
[08:47.140 --> 08:48.860]  right. Quirks. It's an art. They call us,
[08:49.060 --> 08:52.380]  they call them extract artists before anything else. I love it. Uh,
[08:52.380 --> 08:55.820]  I'm not sure if I like the high cannabinoid full spectrum extract, the high turf,
[08:56.140 --> 08:59.220]  or, uh, what's the other shit, the distillate that comes in syringes.
[08:59.540 --> 09:02.780]  I'm not sure which I like better right now. It's a really big toss up. Yeah.
[09:02.780 --> 09:06.380]  I think it's really just batches and strains specific for me.
[09:07.540 --> 09:11.340]  I really appreciate, uh, when I'm having a bad head day,
[09:11.340 --> 09:15.220]  like I've got a head trauma and sometimes there's like just a vibration in my
[09:15.220 --> 09:16.660]  brain that drives me fucking crazy.
[09:17.060 --> 09:20.260]  And a big fat dab of distillate will make that go away.
[09:20.540 --> 09:23.020]  And so sometimes distal it's my favorite. Uh,
[09:23.060 --> 09:24.620]  today I had a slight headache after lunch.
[09:24.620 --> 09:25.980]  I ate something that was a little too greasy.
[09:25.980 --> 09:29.020]  I ate a burrito from this fucking place. It's just fucking so delicious,
[09:29.020 --> 09:32.980]  but it's so greasy. Uh, it was all vegetarian. Don't worry. But, uh,
[09:33.340 --> 09:36.660]  the dab I took after that of the lemon, Jeffrey just took my little headache away.
[09:36.660 --> 09:39.140]  It made me, I think it made me forget. I was just so high that I was like,
[09:39.140 --> 09:41.340]  I don't even have a headache. I don't know what I'm doing anymore.
[09:41.900 --> 09:45.060]  Lemon. Jeffrey's doing something really nice for a body high.
[09:45.180 --> 09:47.020]  I think it's doing something real nice to all of us.
[09:47.020 --> 09:50.180]  It's not sedative though. Um, that,
[09:51.780 --> 09:53.740]  that urge to just kind of chill. Is it there?
[09:53.740 --> 09:56.860]  I feel like we should go do a project. Yeah, I think it's,
[09:56.860 --> 09:59.220]  it's just that kind of high. What do you want to do? Let's hear about it.
[09:59.340 --> 10:01.660]  I don't have a good project in mind. It's just,
[10:01.700 --> 10:04.540]  it's that kind of motivating high. It's really nice.
[10:04.660 --> 10:07.140]  You want to clean a garage? Not especially.
[10:07.380 --> 10:09.260]  I've seen your garage. It was worth a try.
[10:09.500 --> 10:11.940]  I thought I'd try to see what you're in the mood to do.
[10:12.100 --> 10:14.900]  I don't want to clean my garage either. Don't feel bad.
[10:15.140 --> 10:18.220]  So, uh, I did invite these guys over for a podcast,
[10:18.220 --> 10:20.260]  not just to sit here and bullshit. We're, uh,
[10:20.740 --> 10:22.740]  that's already covered on plenty of other podcasts.
[10:23.660 --> 10:26.620]  I received an email from a listener and it's quite a long email,
[10:26.980 --> 10:29.260]  but I appreciate these types of emails.
[10:29.620 --> 10:32.700]  I'm not sure if they want me to say their real name. I'm going to scroll down.
[10:32.980 --> 10:36.500]  They just signed it as Lauren. So I guess that's fair enough to say.
[10:36.740 --> 10:39.980]  I said the other person's name on the episode and I had to delete it and edit
[10:39.980 --> 10:44.340]  it. I'm sure you guys heard that. I apologize. Uh, that was funny. Uh,
[10:45.340 --> 10:48.260]  anyway, let's read this email. It goes like this. Hey, Ross to Jeff.
[10:48.260 --> 10:51.660]  I wanted to let you know just how much I value the info I've learned from your
[10:51.660 --> 10:54.980]  growing episodes and how much I appreciate you working so hard to put that
[10:54.980 --> 10:55.940]  information out there.
[10:55.940 --> 10:59.540]  Your podcast is my absolute favorite and I've actually been going back and
[10:59.540 --> 11:03.420]  re-listening to episodes, which I've never done with any other podcast.
[11:03.700 --> 11:05.100]  I listened to your podcast all the time,
[11:05.100 --> 11:09.260]  but especially where I'm working in my veggie garden and in my indoor garden.
[11:09.300 --> 11:11.820]  That's just the start. And we're already hearing a whole bunch of great stuff.
[11:12.380 --> 11:15.300]  I'm their favorite podcast. That's awesome. Thank you. I appreciate that.
[11:15.300 --> 11:17.580]  There are so many great podcasts out there. Uh,
[11:17.620 --> 11:20.340]  you could be listening to Joe Rogan. You could be listening to cereal.
[11:21.220 --> 11:24.180]  You've got so many better options and I'm your favorite. That's rad. Thank you.
[11:24.260 --> 11:26.260]  I completely appreciate that. Uh,
[11:26.260 --> 11:28.180]  you've been going back and listening to old episodes.
[11:28.180 --> 11:32.380]  That's really cool because I'm actually reposting old episodes all over again.
[11:32.380 --> 11:35.940]  So you'll get to hear them in the feed and not have to go dig too far because,
[11:36.300 --> 11:41.300]  uh, iTunes and snitcher will only hold 100 episodes and I've got 213 now.
[11:42.340 --> 11:46.060]  So there's 113 you're getting skipped on the good part.
[11:47.060 --> 11:48.380]  I've created a YouTube channel.
[11:48.380 --> 11:51.300]  You can go to YouTube and search for the grow from your heart podcast.
[11:51.300 --> 11:55.340]  And right now episodes one through 50 are up so you can watch.
[11:55.500 --> 11:57.660]  It's a half-ass video, but all of the audio is there.
[11:57.660 --> 11:59.900]  You can hear every bit of it, uh, one through 50.
[11:59.900 --> 12:02.420]  And I'm working on making all of them and to catch them all up.
[12:02.820 --> 12:06.860]  So you'll be able to catch all of the episodes always in forever on YouTube.
[12:06.860 --> 12:10.140]  Once I get them there, it takes a minute to make the videos. I use a Mac book.
[12:10.140 --> 12:14.060]  I'm using iMovie. I'm inserting photos and just doing it as I go.
[12:14.060 --> 12:17.660]  It takes a minute. Bear with me, but I'm going to get them up there.
[12:18.180 --> 12:19.940]  So you'll get to listen to all the old stuff there.
[12:19.980 --> 12:24.780]  There's a ton of good grow information in those episodes around the fifties to
[12:24.780 --> 12:25.420]  seventies.
[12:25.420 --> 12:29.180]  I was really putting it out with a lot of good intense in depth grow info.
[12:29.380 --> 12:32.500]  And then the head injury kind of fucking slowed that down and I had to get back
[12:32.500 --> 12:35.900]  and now I'm my head's back and now I just work too damn much to put those
[12:35.900 --> 12:36.740]  episodes together.
[12:36.900 --> 12:40.300]  I write them over time and do episodes like these to fill in.
[12:40.300 --> 12:43.180]  And then once I get the long episodes written, I put them out and people love it.
[12:43.540 --> 12:46.420]  Uh, so, uh, you listen to my podcast all the time,
[12:46.420 --> 12:49.340]  but especially when working in the veggie garden and in the indoor garden,
[12:49.340 --> 12:53.100]  that's rad. Uh, I hope I give the plants good energy. I hope they like it.
[12:53.420 --> 12:56.380]  So the email goes on to say, also, I have some questions for you.
[12:56.380 --> 12:57.900]  I'm currently growing canna tonic.
[12:57.900 --> 13:01.660]  Have you ever had any experience with it either consuming or growing with
[13:01.700 --> 13:05.780]  growing it? Uh, I have not had any experience with Canada tonic that I can recall.
[13:05.780 --> 13:10.140]  However, I'm growing Canada dental at three rivers organics. Uh,
[13:10.180 --> 13:15.380]  it gets really tall and it smells fucking amazing. It's gassy. It's real stanky.
[13:15.700 --> 13:19.060]  Uh, it's got some cush, some earth tones to it. I enjoy that one.
[13:19.060 --> 13:21.620]  I couldn't tell you anything specific about it. It doesn't stand.
[13:21.660 --> 13:25.620]  We have 70 strains and the Canada dental. Uh,
[13:25.620 --> 13:27.060]  if I were to take home 10,
[13:27.100 --> 13:30.340]  I would probably choose the Canada dental as one of those 10. Uh,
[13:30.380 --> 13:32.820]  but it just smells like gas and I like the size,
[13:32.820 --> 13:33.940]  but I don't know enough about it.
[13:33.940 --> 13:37.540]  Do you guys have any experience with Canada dental or no, sorry, Canada tonic.
[13:39.060 --> 13:43.020]  I have a little bit of experience with some Canada tonic flower and some
[13:43.060 --> 13:48.100]  extracts. It's a really, I don't know much about how the plant grows itself.
[13:48.180 --> 13:52.820]  Um, the, all the stuff I had was finished, harvested, uh, smoked,
[13:53.420 --> 13:58.300]  um, the, the Canada tonic I had was, uh,
[13:58.500 --> 14:03.260]  kind of gassy like you were talking about, but with the nice sweet, um, after,
[14:03.380 --> 14:07.860]  aftertaste that kind of lingered, um, that it reminiscent of the,
[14:08.140 --> 14:12.300]  the, uh, CBD that tends to be in it. All right. Um,
[14:12.300 --> 14:15.620]  and then the extract was very CBD, uh,
[14:16.220 --> 14:19.540]  heavy as far as the effect and the flavor I had.
[14:19.700 --> 14:23.260]  So that's my experience with it. Real sappy as well.
[14:23.620 --> 14:26.620]  So I want to know if you got this from a seed or from a clone, Lauren,
[14:26.660 --> 14:27.460]  that's what I would like to know.
[14:27.460 --> 14:30.180]  Email me and let me know about that when you reply to me. Uh,
[14:30.220 --> 14:32.220]  cause I want to know if you're running a pack of seeds and if you're doing a
[14:32.220 --> 14:35.100]  phenol hunt and then we'll talk a little bit about that or if you got it from a
[14:35.100 --> 14:38.100]  clone and then, uh, we'll talk about where you got it.
[14:38.100 --> 14:40.780]  And we'll see if you've got a known cut or something like that.
[14:40.780 --> 14:43.740]  And that'll give us some more stuff to talk about around your Canada tonic
[14:43.780 --> 14:47.580]  question. I'm going to move on with the email. There's a lot. It says on one of
[14:47.580 --> 14:50.700]  your other episodes, I was, I believe it was called consumption of cannabis.
[14:50.860 --> 14:55.460]  You had Mike and a friend named Doug. You haven't had him on any other episodes.
[14:55.460 --> 14:57.060]  So I was wondering if he's still doing okay.
[14:57.060 --> 15:00.500]  Or maybe if he just isn't the type to enjoy doing a podcast.
[15:00.500 --> 15:01.900]  I really liked his perspective.
[15:02.140 --> 15:05.740]  My parents are around his age and beginning to feel the aches of age pretty
[15:05.760 --> 15:06.420]  hard.
[15:06.420 --> 15:09.260]  I've been mentioning the possibility of trying cannabis for some of their
[15:09.460 --> 15:11.740]  ailments, but they're a little resistant.
[15:12.100 --> 15:15.380]  I think I'm going to have them listen to that episode to help them move that
[15:15.380 --> 15:20.100]  conversation forward. Uh, Doug's doing well, uh, Doug's, uh,
[15:20.140 --> 15:24.100]  not to be too much of a, whatever, too much into Doug's personal life.
[15:24.100 --> 15:28.260]  Doug's son just got married. Uh, so, uh, he's been tied up in that.
[15:28.740 --> 15:32.940]  And, uh, the family's been in town and there were a lot of cool people in town
[15:32.960 --> 15:36.860]  that haven't been in around, been around for a while. Uh, Doug's health is pretty
[15:36.860 --> 15:41.660]  well. I hung out with Doug, uh, twice recently, and, uh,
[15:41.680 --> 15:44.980]  his mental health seems better than ever to tell you the truth.
[15:44.980 --> 15:46.700]  He's got his head on straight. Uh,
[15:46.700 --> 15:49.180]  sometimes his medicine fucks him up and he's doing really well lately.
[15:49.180 --> 15:52.980]  So Doug is great. Uh, he's just a busy man. My schedule is sporadic.
[15:53.220 --> 15:55.540]  Sometimes I don't even know what I'm going to record. I'm like,
[15:55.580 --> 15:58.380]  I look at the clock and I'm like, hi, I could record right now. Let's do this.
[15:58.740 --> 16:01.260]  Uh, Kevin wanted to come hang out today. Uh,
[16:01.260 --> 16:04.380]  I wanted to hang out with Mike and it's Friday. And I called these guys.
[16:04.380 --> 16:06.980]  It's like podcasts, my house six o'clock. And they're like, Oh, okay.
[16:07.380 --> 16:08.900]  And since Kevin wanted to hang out,
[16:08.900 --> 16:11.860]  I was like it's cool to do an episode with about old stuff when bring Kevin
[16:11.860 --> 16:14.020]  back. Cause he hasn't been on in a while. So I thought that was neat.
[16:14.420 --> 16:17.340]  Right. It worked out perfect, but it's sporadic trying to,
[16:17.380 --> 16:20.900]  trying to add in with Doug's schedule is just real tricky. Yeah. Yeah.
[16:21.020 --> 16:23.260]  But Doug's doing well. He's doing really well. Uh,
[16:23.260 --> 16:26.900]  what do you call it when your son gets married? What are you now? Are you,
[16:27.020 --> 16:30.100]  does that change your status? No. If David got married, would you,
[16:30.100 --> 16:32.180]  what would you be? You have a daughter in law. There you go.
[16:32.180 --> 16:35.340]  He's got one of those now. And she's, uh, she's a beautiful woman.
[16:35.340 --> 16:36.860]  She's a great woman. She's intelligent.
[16:36.900 --> 16:40.460]  She seems to have her shit together and she's got an adorable little guy.
[16:40.620 --> 16:43.100]  So they've got a great little family situation happening.
[16:43.100 --> 16:45.660]  So congratulations to Zach if you're listening to congrats man. Yeah.
[16:45.780 --> 16:48.220]  Congrats Doug and the whole family. They're great fucking people.
[16:48.220 --> 16:50.660]  I love that whole family. They're all genuine.
[16:50.660 --> 16:54.180]  Like they all just have a smile to them just in their walk. You know what I mean?
[16:54.180 --> 16:57.140]  They seem genuine. Yeah. Doug's great. I haven't seen him in a long time,
[16:57.140 --> 17:00.620]  so it's good to hear that he's doing well. We'll have to get him over. Uh,
[17:00.940 --> 17:03.340]  as to the part about your parents, uh,
[17:03.380 --> 17:07.220]  considering cannabis cause they're feeling aches and pains of age real hard and,
[17:07.260 --> 17:11.420]  uh, they're resistant. Uh, what have they got to lose?
[17:11.420 --> 17:15.740]  They could try cannabis once and see if it works and they'll know if they love
[17:15.740 --> 17:18.500]  it or hate it. And then they've got a decision. If you don't try it,
[17:18.500 --> 17:22.460]  maybe there's something. Okay. Uh, sir, ma'am,
[17:23.020 --> 17:26.780]  if you try it once, you'll know if you love it or hate it. And if it does work,
[17:26.780 --> 17:29.060]  you may have the magical cure. And if it doesn't,
[17:29.060 --> 17:30.700]  then you just don't have to do it again.
[17:31.020 --> 17:35.580]  It's worth one shitty experience maybe to find out if you could have relief for
[17:35.580 --> 17:36.500]  the rest of your life.
[17:36.540 --> 17:40.820]  You don't even have to worry about a shitty experience now. If, I mean,
[17:40.820 --> 17:41.780]  depending on where you live,
[17:41.820 --> 17:46.380]  I was just scrolling through my phone and saw another advertisement for a very
[17:46.380 --> 17:50.460]  low dose THC, but a nice moderate dose CBD edible.
[17:51.060 --> 17:54.540]  I think it was like two milligrams and 10 milligrams or something. Uh,
[17:54.560 --> 17:58.300]  but those are pretty common in Colorado, California, Washington, Oregon.
[17:58.300 --> 18:00.060]  You just go to the store and pick up a pack,
[18:00.100 --> 18:04.380]  take them over to your parents' house. They don't have to worry about getting,
[18:04.620 --> 18:06.420]  you know, two stone or anything like that.
[18:06.420 --> 18:09.180]  There's not enough THC in the whole pack to really get high,
[18:09.580 --> 18:13.540]  but there's 10 good CBD doses in there. I mean, in Colorado anyway,
[18:14.140 --> 18:17.860]  and that's more than enough to try out a product a couple of evenings and see if
[18:17.860 --> 18:19.820]  it helps with the aches and pains. And you don't ever,
[18:19.900 --> 18:21.860]  like there's nothing to worry about that route.
[18:21.980 --> 18:26.340]  It probably, I'm not a doctor. It won't interact with medicine, medications.
[18:26.380 --> 18:30.940]  It can THC can amplify painkillers, but that's really about it.
[18:31.260 --> 18:34.820]  It's an, unless they have a job that's going to drug test them.
[18:35.100 --> 18:38.140]  There's nothing to really be too worried about. Right.
[18:38.260 --> 18:42.660]  People are afraid because of programming, uh, because of prohibition,
[18:42.700 --> 18:45.980]  because our good president said it was illegal a hundred years ago.
[18:46.260 --> 18:47.980]  And that's how it's been. Uh,
[18:48.100 --> 18:51.940]  it'll be okay if you try a little bit of THC and a whole lot of CBD,
[18:52.340 --> 18:56.900]  it'll probably make you feel better. And like I said, once ain't gonna hurt you.
[18:56.980 --> 18:59.740]  It may make you feel a whole lot better. What if you find relief?
[18:59.740 --> 19:02.700]  What if you're knocking a thing that is the one thing that's going to make your
[19:02.700 --> 19:05.180]  life better? You're getting old, what you got to lose.
[19:05.180 --> 19:07.220]  You're not going to live forever. Enjoy these last years.
[19:07.540 --> 19:11.540]  That would be my advice. Might be a little cynical the way I said that, huh?
[19:12.060 --> 19:15.260]  I apologize. Feel good. Shit. You aren't going to live forever.
[19:15.260 --> 19:17.740]  Feel good while you're here. That's my opinion. Enjoy it.
[19:17.980 --> 19:21.380]  And thanks for sharing that episode or at least thinking about it.
[19:21.380 --> 19:25.540]  That's why we recorded that specific episode was to,
[19:25.580 --> 19:30.340]  to get some information about CBD and using some of these products to manage aches
[19:30.340 --> 19:34.060]  and pains specifically. So thank you for helping us, uh,
[19:34.180 --> 19:36.180]  achieve its intended goal. Yeah. Yeah.
[19:36.260 --> 19:39.860]  And let us know if you do talk to your folks about using cannabis.
[19:40.540 --> 19:42.580]  And if you want some guidance, maybe you will, uh,
[19:42.900 --> 19:45.180]  Mike and I and I'll ask other people and be like, Hey,
[19:45.220 --> 19:48.660]  how would you approach talking to your folks about starting to use some cannabis
[19:48.660 --> 19:50.300]  as part of your daily regimen?
[19:50.300 --> 19:53.900]  Feel better. Did that for a living for a while. Yeah. Yeah.
[19:54.220 --> 19:55.820]  Well, one time or another,
[19:55.820 --> 19:57.900]  Kev's old man uses cannabis for relief.
[19:57.980 --> 20:02.980]  Like I have quite the extensive and versatile history of cannabis use for
[20:03.980 --> 20:05.060]  medical purposes.
[20:05.060 --> 20:08.460]  There's been several people in my family and myself included that have used it
[20:08.460 --> 20:10.420]  for several different things. My,
[20:10.540 --> 20:13.900]  my father uses it for chronic pain and uh,
[20:13.940 --> 20:18.660]  now to treat his cancer. So, um, it's,
[20:19.020 --> 20:23.100]  it's very wide range with my experience, uh,
[20:23.140 --> 20:27.580]  from chronic pain, various, uh, diseases, surgeries,
[20:28.180 --> 20:32.780]  yeah. Uh, sleep issues, um, eating disorders,
[20:33.820 --> 20:37.620]  I mean it, it just kind of goes on and on for me and my experience. So
[20:38.780 --> 20:43.140]  it makes stuff that hurts not hurt. Yeah. It just makes it just,
[20:43.380 --> 20:44.220]  just kind of, uh,
[20:44.220 --> 20:47.300]  I couldn't say it any simpler than that. That's yeah. I mean,
[20:47.300 --> 20:51.500]  it works on so many different levels because the endocannabinoid system,
[20:52.380 --> 20:56.140]  um, is throughout your body. It, it impacts every system. So
[20:56.820 --> 20:58.700]  it's like a foot rub for the inside of your body.
[20:58.900 --> 21:02.100]  It just makes everything just feel like it is loosened up just a little tiny bit.
[21:02.420 --> 21:03.780]  Like it helps dull the pain.
[21:03.780 --> 21:06.180]  It helps treat the inflammation that's causing the pain.
[21:06.220 --> 21:09.340]  It's just a miraculous plant when you get it.
[21:09.340 --> 21:14.220]  It helps your body heal itself. Yeah. Yep. And handle its own problems. Yep.
[21:14.340 --> 21:16.580]  All right. Well, I think everybody gets the point. They get the point.
[21:17.140 --> 21:19.460]  We love cannabis. We love cannabinoids.
[21:19.460 --> 21:22.980]  We love the healing properties of this plant that we, we advocate. Uh,
[21:22.980 --> 21:25.260]  there's more to this email. So I want to keep moving. Uh,
[21:25.260 --> 21:29.060]  this listener and email or says my next question,
[21:29.260 --> 21:32.380]  will you be putting out any golden goat seeds again in the future?
[21:32.380 --> 21:34.940]  I remember hearing that you put out around 5,000 and I also,
[21:34.940 --> 21:37.340]  you remember saying that you wouldn't do feminized seeds again,
[21:37.380 --> 21:39.980]  any plans to release more? I really want to grow it,
[21:39.980 --> 21:42.220]  but it is impossible for me to get a clone.
[21:42.700 --> 21:45.060]  Also do you have any other breeding projects going on?
[21:45.060 --> 21:47.940]  I don't think I've heard you talking about your plans or projects regarding
[21:47.940 --> 21:51.780]  breeding in a while. I find that stuff very interesting as a beginner grower.
[21:51.780 --> 21:54.700]  I figure you're very busy with your job podcast and life.
[21:54.700 --> 21:55.900]  There's a lot of stuff in there.
[21:55.900 --> 21:59.660]  So let me recap this paragraph and I'll answer the questions as we go. Uh,
[21:59.660 --> 22:04.260]  will you be putting out any seeds of golden goat in the near future? Um,
[22:04.700 --> 22:07.180]  highly unlikely, most likely that's just a no,
[22:07.180 --> 22:09.380]  not plain golden goat by itself.
[22:10.420 --> 22:12.700]  That takes a lot of work that I don't want to do right now.
[22:12.860 --> 22:15.540]  Cause I'm working on other stuff, which will be part of a future answer.
[22:16.420 --> 22:21.140]  However, I do have things like firefly. Uh, no wait, that's lemon skunk.
[22:21.380 --> 22:25.100]  There is, there are things that are close to golden goat available.
[22:25.100 --> 22:27.500]  I've got golden goat to a rise. Uh,
[22:27.540 --> 22:29.900]  I took the golden goat and crossed it to a rise.
[22:29.900 --> 22:32.100]  A rise is golden goat to daybreaker.
[22:32.340 --> 22:36.340]  There are phenotypes that come out that look exactly like golden goat.
[22:36.580 --> 22:40.260]  So that's available. Um, I'm not sure where you can get that,
[22:40.460 --> 22:44.300]  but send me an email and I will find a distributor that's got it in stock for
[22:44.300 --> 22:48.420]  you. Um, what else do I need to answer here? Uh,
[22:48.620 --> 22:52.940]  you said that I said I won't do feminized seeds again. I'm not certain of that.
[22:52.940 --> 22:56.980]  I just, I would rather make regular seeds. It's easier. It's more fun for me.
[22:57.380 --> 22:59.820]  Uh, I like having more males to work with.
[22:59.820 --> 23:03.100]  I feel like I pigeonhole myself making feminized seeds.
[23:03.100 --> 23:06.620]  There's a huge market for it, but I'm not only breeding for the market.
[23:07.300 --> 23:10.020]  I'm breeding to create specific traits.
[23:10.020 --> 23:13.460]  And at the same time I'm also breeding to see what comes out of some of the
[23:13.460 --> 23:16.860]  things I've already done to keep my cubes and squares happening the way I want
[23:16.860 --> 23:21.060]  to, uh, any plans to release more, not just straight up golden goat, uh,
[23:21.060 --> 23:24.340]  not more feminine seeds for a long time. Then you said you really want to grow,
[23:24.340 --> 23:26.660]  but it's impossible to get a clone. Come to Colorado.
[23:26.660 --> 23:28.500]  We can get you a golden goat clone. Um,
[23:28.660 --> 23:31.860]  you have to give me warning and that's not an open invite for everybody to just
[23:31.860 --> 23:35.380]  fucking show up. But if you're in Colorado, it's legal for me to give you a
[23:35.380 --> 23:37.780]  call. I already hear a fucking life for me, bro.
[23:37.780 --> 23:40.740]  You gotta be careful with the doorbell just rang. What the fuck is going on?
[23:40.780 --> 23:43.420]  You look at me funny. When I talk about giving away a sticker,
[23:43.420 --> 23:47.620]  you just tell people about golden goat clods. If you get here, you can get one.
[23:47.620 --> 23:49.380]  It's not that hard. There are several places.
[23:49.580 --> 23:51.220]  There's a dispensary right now that has them.
[23:51.540 --> 23:55.220]  I'm sure you could find it in Colorado if you spent a couple hours calling
[23:55.220 --> 23:59.980]  shops. Yeah, but we can figure something out. Um, where are we in this email?
[24:00.580 --> 24:02.780]  Uh, also, do you have any other breeding projects going on?
[24:02.780 --> 24:07.060]  It's funny you should ask just a couple of days ago. I put, um,
[24:07.100 --> 24:09.900]  about there are 16, 17, 18,
[24:09.900 --> 24:13.340]  and there are about 20 plus or minus 20, uh,
[24:13.380 --> 24:18.380]  females under a light with a Solomon male in the middle and they will get a
[24:19.540 --> 24:21.220]  hit hit with Paul and it's seven Oh nine. You guys,
[24:21.220 --> 24:24.660]  if anybody wants to get a dab going, it's almost time for some seven 10. Uh,
[24:24.700 --> 24:28.900]  here's a dabber for you. I'll grab this dabber.
[24:29.300 --> 24:32.300]  I only got two dabbers and three people, but we'll fucking take dabs.
[24:33.540 --> 24:36.260]  You two go over, but I have a dabber.
[24:37.300 --> 24:40.020]  There's another dabber on that table, but this'll work. We'll, we'll,
[24:40.180 --> 24:44.020]  we can make it happen. We're not going to get this going by seven 10.
[24:44.020 --> 24:47.140]  I'm not so Michael be late.
[24:48.140 --> 24:52.020]  I can be late. I was late today. So, you know, right. I was early.
[24:52.020 --> 24:54.740]  Does anybody have any clue where the fuck we were in this talk? Oh,
[24:54.740 --> 24:59.620]  breeding stuff. I've got Solomon was about ready to knock up a bunch of plants
[24:59.620 --> 25:03.540]  downstairs. If I, yeah, Solomon is going to knock up some stuff. Um,
[25:03.540 --> 25:06.900]  there's some Kalonji Kush. There's a Capelton in there. There's some grateful dog.
[25:07.300 --> 25:09.900]  The grateful dog plus the grateful dog to arise,
[25:10.580 --> 25:13.860]  a strain called morning dew and it smells a lot like the grateful dog.
[25:14.060 --> 25:16.380]  We're only going to be able to dab one at a time because this rig's clogged and
[25:16.380 --> 25:19.740]  I can't get the nail off. Cause, uh, that's things just sealed shut.
[25:19.740 --> 25:22.500]  It's been smoked through solid. That's the only useful rig at the table.
[25:22.500 --> 25:26.340]  So one day I'm more concerned with flaming recording equipment that I have
[25:26.340 --> 25:28.540]  with dabbing on time. Can handle this. Here's a torch, bro.
[25:28.540 --> 25:29.940]  You go ahead and take the dab, you get lined up.
[25:29.940 --> 25:32.780]  And then after that I'll take one and then we'll get Mike a dab going. Cool.
[25:33.060 --> 25:37.540]  Um, uh, so yeah, I've got those plants in there. Also there's Capelton.
[25:37.580 --> 25:40.220]  There is Kalonji Kush. Those have never been bred to the arise.
[25:40.220 --> 25:42.780]  I don't know what that's going to make. There's a white widow in there.
[25:43.300 --> 25:48.100]  There is, uh, there's Helzo G in there. There's Jeff's OG in there.
[25:48.300 --> 25:52.100]  Yeah. Arise to Helzo G, arise to Jeff's OG. So that's in there.
[25:52.100 --> 25:54.580]  There's Helzo G I'm trying to think by the rose,
[25:54.620 --> 25:57.180]  but I get thrown off cause I moved some stuff around the other day.
[25:57.380 --> 25:59.540]  There's a platinum tangy in there, uh,
[25:59.580 --> 26:02.300]  that I think was made by the garden of Whedon. There's a Jack flash.
[26:02.300 --> 26:05.980]  There's a chem four. There's a star dog. Um, yeah,
[26:06.020 --> 26:08.820]  they're all going to get pollinated by the King Solomon.
[26:08.820 --> 26:12.260]  So those are all underway. I recently made, uh,
[26:12.260 --> 26:14.980]  something that I've just been calling the cream it's cookies and cream number
[26:14.980 --> 26:18.300]  13 from exotic genetics, the female that, uh,
[26:18.300 --> 26:20.860]  a lot of people have been using for a lot of great hash making and breeding
[26:20.860 --> 26:25.620]  projects. Uh, I hit that with the arise pollen. I just call it the cream. Uh,
[26:25.660 --> 26:30.660]  it makes some stinky phenotypes that stay short. Uh, they make the,
[26:31.140 --> 26:32.980]  all the bottom branches grow to the same length.
[26:33.020 --> 26:36.300]  So they all come up to a nice even canopy and then they make one top that comes
[26:36.300 --> 26:38.980]  right out of that, that sticks up. If you cut that tip off,
[26:38.980 --> 26:42.380]  you get this nice little menorah, this nice fucking ease of even canopy.
[26:42.380 --> 26:45.540]  And you can scrug it out real beautifully. That's cool. Uh, that's a cool one.
[26:45.540 --> 26:49.860]  I made lemon Jeffrey to the arise. Oh, nice. Uh, it it's okay.
[26:49.860 --> 26:52.700]  It seems to, it's a little stretchy. It's a little sativa.
[26:52.740 --> 26:56.180]  And there's a lot of support. There's a lot of sativa in that. Yeah.
[26:56.900 --> 27:00.260]  Yeah. There's a lot of stretchy traits in there too. So, uh, but yeah,
[27:00.260 --> 27:01.660]  it'll stretch and it'll go sativa.
[27:01.660 --> 27:03.820]  I've got one small one in a flower room right now.
[27:03.820 --> 27:06.420]  We're seeing what it does underneath a small light. Uh,
[27:06.420 --> 27:09.820]  and I put it in a smaller pot and I'm trying to see if I can keep it compacted.
[27:09.820 --> 27:14.100]  I flowered it earlier. I want to see if I can kind of force it to stay smaller.
[27:14.380 --> 27:17.300]  I didn't top it this time. I'm just playing with things. Uh,
[27:17.300 --> 27:20.000]  you can cap it that way if you want to. That's not the way I would have done it,
[27:20.000 --> 27:21.100]  but we're going to let you slide.
[27:21.300 --> 27:24.660]  No, I wasn't going to do it that way either, but it's the way it was. Yeah.
[27:24.660 --> 27:27.300]  Sometimes you just got to do what you got to do when a carb caps on the table.
[27:27.340 --> 27:32.220]  No worries. Uh, so yeah, that's my most recent breeding projects. I did do the,
[27:33.100 --> 27:38.100]  I hit a white widow with a rise pollen and I have not grown any of those seeds.
[27:38.460 --> 27:41.500]  I hit flow with the rise pollen. I haven't grown any of those seeds.
[27:41.860 --> 27:45.300]  So there's some stuff that needs to be tested. I just haven't done it yet.
[27:45.860 --> 27:49.140]  And there's not enough of them to send them out to get other people to test
[27:49.140 --> 27:51.140]  them. I just did one small plant. So that's,
[27:51.140 --> 27:52.740]  that's what's going on with the breeding projects.
[27:52.860 --> 27:55.340]  Feel free to any of the stuff that's open here.
[27:55.420 --> 27:58.740]  I'll take it. I'm going to dip this golden goat dab into some of your, uh,
[27:58.740 --> 28:01.060]  lemon skunk turps is what I'm really interested in.
[28:01.220 --> 28:03.620]  I just took was ridiculous. I see the look on your face.
[28:03.620 --> 28:06.140]  You look like you're swimming and drowning and maybe, uh,
[28:06.220 --> 28:08.300]  maybe masturbating a little bit at the same time.
[28:10.140 --> 28:12.420]  I'm going to just give it just a little mini dunk right there.
[28:12.420 --> 28:15.100]  Just put some of that on there. So, uh,
[28:15.500 --> 28:18.100]  I tried to describe the consistency of those turps last night.
[28:18.340 --> 28:20.540]  I didn't mention that there's like a little surface tension.
[28:20.560 --> 28:24.420]  You can feel when you go to push it, it doesn't,
[28:24.820 --> 28:27.220]  the dab doesn't go through the turps immediately.
[28:27.220 --> 28:30.660]  You have to break the surface tension to get the turps onto the dab.
[28:30.980 --> 28:34.100]  You can like sprinkle a dab in there and it would just stay on the top.
[28:34.340 --> 28:38.740]  It wouldn't fall to the bottom. Interesting. Yeah, it's pretty neat. Pretty neat.
[28:38.780 --> 28:41.260]  So I am going to take this dab. Um,
[28:41.300 --> 28:45.860]  let me read something to fire one of you guys off on a talk here because,
[28:46.220 --> 28:49.780]  um, let's see, they said, how many plans, breeding projects,
[28:49.780 --> 28:53.300]  talk about breeding projects. Very interested as a new grower. Awesome.
[28:53.300 --> 28:54.660]  I love it when new growers listen.
[28:54.660 --> 28:58.060]  I figure you're very busy with your job podcast and personal life. Yeah.
[28:58.060 --> 29:01.460]  I work a lot. Like Jeff's totally busy. Like there you go, Mike, go for it.
[29:01.740 --> 29:04.700]  Jump in, do it, do it, do it. I'm gonna take a dab. Um, yeah.
[29:04.700 --> 29:08.740]  Tell them about how busy I am. That's that's honestly, that's why, um,
[29:08.780 --> 29:11.300]  certain guests are on more often than not.
[29:11.300 --> 29:15.540]  Me and Jeff are able to make our schedules line up a little bit better. Um,
[29:15.620 --> 29:20.700]  Jesse is equal or easily as busy as Jeff, if not more so.
[29:21.820 --> 29:24.260]  Um, he's way busier than I am. And I'm going to take the dab.
[29:24.300 --> 29:26.900]  I'm going to cut in while I'm just heating. And then as soon as I stop,
[29:27.300 --> 29:28.580]  I'll take the dab and you can talk more.
[29:28.580 --> 29:32.740]  I'm going to apologize for Jesse not making it. Uh, I know why he didn't make it.
[29:32.740 --> 29:35.700]  He had to transplant a bunch of plants and somebody didn't show up for work.
[29:35.700 --> 29:39.860]  They got a late start. Uh, Jesse tried to come last week and got hosed.
[29:39.860 --> 29:42.460]  It wasn't his fault. So I'm going to apologize on his behalf.
[29:42.460 --> 29:44.580]  I'm sorry I pumped you guys up saying he was coming.
[29:44.820 --> 29:48.220]  He apologizes for not making it. Uh, that kind of shit happens.
[29:48.220 --> 29:52.220]  We're ganja growers. We work in a commercial facility. And if she goes wrong,
[29:52.260 --> 29:54.500]  since we're the managers, we're the ones that pulled a slack.
[29:54.500 --> 29:57.020]  And that's why he didn't make it. He pulled the slack and made that shit work.
[29:57.260 --> 29:59.460]  My dad's ready. So one, two, three, somebody talk.
[30:00.940 --> 30:01.780]  Oh, geez.
[30:03.580 --> 30:04.940]  They Mexican stand up.
[30:07.380 --> 30:09.340]  Oh, that was great. That was perfect, dude. Good job.
[30:09.380 --> 30:12.420]  Do you recover from that? Dab? Yeah, buddy. I'm still trying to.
[30:12.500 --> 30:16.060]  That's like, that was what I look for. I wasn't going to stare you down.
[30:16.060 --> 30:17.940]  I was like, I wonder if he's ready to talk yet.
[30:17.940 --> 30:20.660]  He was still making dab faces a second ago. Exactly.
[30:20.660 --> 30:22.140]  When I was making those dab faces,
[30:22.140 --> 30:27.020]  it still felt like I was still taking a dab. That's so funny. Jeff's dab so big.
[30:27.020 --> 30:31.700]  I just got like half a dab randomly across the table.
[30:32.780 --> 30:36.100]  Oh, this stuff is so good. We're so spoiled here. Yeah.
[30:36.860 --> 30:41.300]  Colorado's full. We want to emphasize that. Those lemon turps are stupid.
[30:41.460 --> 30:44.060]  Oh yeah. Right.
[30:44.940 --> 30:45.940]  That's just a flag.
[30:49.660 --> 30:54.180]  I want to read and see if this is right for us because this is OK.
[30:55.900 --> 30:58.980]  I was reading the label myself earlier this morning.
[30:59.100 --> 31:02.060]  That tastes like I just dabbed lemon pledge. Yeah.
[31:02.700 --> 31:04.820]  No, I'm serious. In the best way.
[31:05.100 --> 31:06.460]  But I OD'd on it.
[31:06.460 --> 31:09.860]  It was just like I dabbed a little bit too much lemon pledge.
[31:10.460 --> 31:11.620]  Oh, shit.
[31:12.620 --> 31:14.580]  Oh, am I falling out of the chairs?
[31:14.580 --> 31:17.780]  It just looked like that. Both. OK.
[31:17.780 --> 31:20.140]  I'm OK, you guys. I am OK. Do not call 911.
[31:20.140 --> 31:22.220]  I may need a life alert fucking bracelet soon.
[31:22.220 --> 31:24.660]  Oh man, those smell amazing. Yeah, they're pretty.
[31:24.780 --> 31:27.580]  I'll get you a little golden dab and then you can just I'll let Kev
[31:27.580 --> 31:30.020]  dunk it into his turps for you.
[31:30.900 --> 31:33.060]  Then you can experience what I just did to my face.
[31:33.460 --> 31:37.780]  Mike, Mike doesn't need big dad, so his dab to turp ratio
[31:37.780 --> 31:40.260]  is going to be much better than ours was.
[31:40.300 --> 31:42.020]  Is that a good dab for you? That's perfect.
[31:42.020 --> 31:44.540]  Cool. It looks insulting if somebody gave me that.
[31:44.780 --> 31:46.940]  What the fuck, dude? Can I get a dab?
[31:47.740 --> 31:49.780]  That looks like the should I wipe off my dabber?
[31:49.780 --> 31:53.500]  Yeah, I that's the reason when like when I'm offering people a dab,
[31:53.500 --> 31:56.100]  I just hand them the hash and a dabber and kind of pray
[31:56.100 --> 31:57.620]  that they don't send it flying everywhere.
[32:00.060 --> 32:03.740]  Like I'm about to do right now, it's running on my time to dab.
[32:04.180 --> 32:04.860]  I'll hit the nail.
[32:04.860 --> 32:07.180]  If it was a full size dab, we'd be fine right now.
[32:07.180 --> 32:08.140]  But he's got the gold.
[32:08.140 --> 32:11.660]  So I've got a piece of your blowing glass skunk.
[32:12.620 --> 32:15.220]  I got to keep it turning full spectrum extract.
[32:15.580 --> 32:16.820]  Don't on it.
[32:16.820 --> 32:18.900]  It smells like lemon candies in here.
[32:18.900 --> 32:21.220]  Everybody's highest draft right now.
[32:21.260 --> 32:22.980]  We can't keep our attention straight.
[32:22.980 --> 32:24.100]  The computer's recording.
[32:24.100 --> 32:25.220]  We're in the middle of an email.
[32:25.220 --> 32:27.580]  They like a great fucking podcast.
[32:27.580 --> 32:30.100]  I can't wait to get back to this email and find out where we are.
[32:30.100 --> 32:31.980]  It's at the bottom of the email.
[32:31.980 --> 32:33.580]  Find which way is up again.
[32:33.580 --> 32:34.940]  All right. This is hot as shit.
[32:34.940 --> 32:37.620]  So give it a few minutes. Don't dab that yet.
[32:37.620 --> 32:40.620]  Here's a card. Let's go. Red means go.
[32:40.620 --> 32:42.260]  I would use the other carb cap.
[32:42.260 --> 32:43.580]  I would use this one.
[32:44.660 --> 32:45.900]  Me too.
[32:46.660 --> 32:47.780]  This one needs a wipe down.
[32:47.780 --> 32:50.020]  It's got some kitty fur or something on it now.
[32:50.020 --> 32:52.300]  That's the one that pooped over here yesterday.
[32:52.300 --> 32:54.100]  Oh, and just a little resin came out.
[32:54.100 --> 32:56.420]  Nice little hash cloud comes dropping out of the car.
[32:56.420 --> 32:57.620]  Yeah,
[32:58.380 --> 33:01.020]  I don't have a kitty, so it's weird that it's got cat fur on it,
[33:01.020 --> 33:03.060]  but I'm going to be OK with that. All right.
[33:08.020 --> 33:09.820]  I told somebody
[33:09.940 --> 33:12.380]  one day you're going to make a whole bunch of cats real happy.
[33:13.780 --> 33:15.500]  She didn't take too kindly to that one.
[33:15.500 --> 33:17.020]  All right, let's get back on.
[33:17.020 --> 33:18.180]  Let's get back on this email.
[33:19.740 --> 33:22.020]  Where was I? Sorry, no golden go to this for a minute.
[33:22.220 --> 33:25.340]  Also, I love updates on the people you've had on previously, of course,
[33:25.980 --> 33:28.220]  if it's appropriate and if they are OK with it.
[33:28.220 --> 33:30.460]  We already talked a lot about Doug. Doug, I hope you're OK with that.
[33:30.460 --> 33:33.020]  And then they said, like sloppy
[33:33.020 --> 33:36.380]  quick update on sloppy hashtag free sloppy sloppies in jail.
[33:38.020 --> 33:39.660]  Yeah, sloppy fucked up.
[33:39.660 --> 33:41.020]  I'm not exactly sure what happened.
[33:41.020 --> 33:43.100]  I'm not sure that I should talk too much about it on a podcast.
[33:44.220 --> 33:46.260]  Allegedly, Pod sloppy is in jail.
[33:46.260 --> 33:48.580]  Free sloppy. Get sloppy out of jail. I love you, sloppy.
[33:49.620 --> 33:51.780]  Get out of there. Be careful.
[33:51.780 --> 33:52.900]  I love you, bro.
[33:52.900 --> 33:55.820]  The traveling stoner, the traveling stoner is doing the traveling stoner shit.
[33:55.820 --> 33:58.860]  She Bobo Blasterco is working at a dispensary in Springs.
[33:59.100 --> 33:59.660]  I know it's weird.
[33:59.660 --> 34:02.260]  You asked about the traveling stoner and I talked about Bobo, but they are
[34:02.500 --> 34:04.380]  they are one unit.
[34:04.380 --> 34:05.980]  Bobo, they're traveling.
[34:05.980 --> 34:07.620]  Bobo works at a dispensary in Springs.
[34:07.620 --> 34:09.220]  They hang out at the glass grind.
[34:09.220 --> 34:13.700]  They do product development meetings with a lot of
[34:14.780 --> 34:18.020]  medium, high and high level products in the cannabis
[34:18.020 --> 34:21.260]  and crossover cannabis industries and clothing companies.
[34:22.260 --> 34:23.740]  She's doing well. She stays busy as fuck.
[34:23.740 --> 34:25.220]  Her website is up.
[34:25.220 --> 34:27.980]  I encourage you to check out the traveling stoner dot com
[34:27.980 --> 34:30.140]  and let her know that Rasta Jeff sent you there.
[34:30.140 --> 34:33.060]  I was listening to the podcast and Rasta Jeff said I should come check this out.
[34:33.860 --> 34:39.140]  Uh, Spencer, Spencer and Maddie are in Washington running a gigantic
[34:39.140 --> 34:43.140]  in the dream, crushing it, crushing it like fucking Voltron.
[34:43.140 --> 34:46.300]  I don't know if their social media is like one of my favorite things all week.
[34:46.340 --> 34:51.380]  Yeah, they have a gigantic outdoor slash greenhouse garden in Washington.
[34:51.380 --> 34:55.020]  It's the I five oh two tier one and tier two gardens.
[34:55.020 --> 35:00.340]  They grow a large percentage of all the cannabis sold in their state.
[35:00.900 --> 35:02.420]  They're very well respected.
[35:02.420 --> 35:04.580]  All of their pictures are fucking amazing.
[35:04.580 --> 35:05.180]  Follow.
[35:06.220 --> 35:09.180]  It's probably Garden of Weed and W.E.D.
[35:09.180 --> 35:12.220]  And on Instagram, I'm not sure where they get deleted.
[35:12.220 --> 35:14.060]  So they just remake shit.
[35:14.060 --> 35:15.060]  Follow them. Check them out.
[35:15.060 --> 35:16.020]  They're crushing it.
[35:16.020 --> 35:18.100]  They're always doing well.
[35:18.100 --> 35:21.820]  Spencer and Maddie are doing well, not only like social media wise and whatever,
[35:21.820 --> 35:23.300]  but they're great people. They're doing well.
[35:23.300 --> 35:24.540]  They were here just a few months ago.
[35:24.540 --> 35:27.140]  They visited. We hung out. We took dabs.
[35:27.140 --> 35:29.140]  Spence had a smile on his face to see all the crew.
[35:29.140 --> 35:31.580]  Maddie looked fucking beautiful as ever.
[35:32.100 --> 35:33.780]  She knows I think she's beautiful.
[35:33.780 --> 35:34.860]  She looked fucking beautiful.
[35:34.860 --> 35:36.420]  She had a big smile on her face.
[35:36.420 --> 35:38.020]  So everybody's doing well in that front.
[35:38.020 --> 35:38.740]  Who else did you say?
[35:38.740 --> 35:40.340]  Dabbing Granny.
[35:40.340 --> 35:42.460]  Dabbing Granny is crazy as always.
[35:42.460 --> 35:44.060]  Take it. She had a little cold for a little while.
[35:44.060 --> 35:46.340]  She had some chest congestion going on.
[35:46.340 --> 35:47.740]  She seemed to spit that out.
[35:47.740 --> 35:48.580]  She didn't take a minute, bro.
[35:48.580 --> 35:50.740]  She just soldered through it. So it went away.
[35:50.740 --> 35:51.660]  It's gone.
[35:51.660 --> 35:53.260]  It feels like she coughed that out.
[35:53.260 --> 35:55.300]  She doesn't cough and wheeze as much as she was.
[35:55.300 --> 35:57.660]  She's a social butterfly.
[35:57.660 --> 35:58.740]  She's a great person.
[35:58.740 --> 36:00.380]  She's doing very well.
[36:00.420 --> 36:02.220]  She's taking good care of her.
[36:02.220 --> 36:03.300]  I think it's her husband.
[36:03.300 --> 36:03.940]  Yeah, it's her husband.
[36:03.940 --> 36:04.900]  Kevin's her husband.
[36:04.900 --> 36:07.300]  Taking good care of old Kev.
[36:07.300 --> 36:09.820]  They're having a good time, but taking care of shit.
[36:09.820 --> 36:10.660]  Jesse. Jesse.
[36:10.660 --> 36:12.820]  We talked about Jesse a minute ago.
[36:12.820 --> 36:14.060]  Jesse's busy as fuck.
[36:14.060 --> 36:16.980]  He's managing a facility that is doing very well.
[36:16.980 --> 36:19.260]  His pictures of his grow are awesome.
[36:19.260 --> 36:20.980]  He doesn't post as much as most people do
[36:20.980 --> 36:22.300]  because he's too busy.
[36:22.300 --> 36:23.500]  He's not really into the social media.
[36:23.500 --> 36:25.060]  He's kind of a farm boy and a dope grower,
[36:25.060 --> 36:26.660]  not an Instagram celebrity.
[36:26.660 --> 36:28.380]  That's just his style.
[36:28.380 --> 36:29.460]  Jesse's doing well.
[36:29.460 --> 36:30.500]  Of course, Kev's back.
[36:30.500 --> 36:32.340]  That's why I wanted Kev on this episode.
[36:32.340 --> 36:33.180]  How you doing, Kev?
[36:33.180 --> 36:34.300]  You can speak for yourself on here.
[36:34.300 --> 36:35.140]  Yep, yep.
[36:35.140 --> 36:36.620]  Doing good now.
[36:37.780 --> 36:39.460]  I got sober.
[36:39.460 --> 36:40.820]  No more alcohol for this guy.
[36:40.820 --> 36:43.220]  So that was a really huge change in my life
[36:43.220 --> 36:45.700]  and it was 100% to the positive.
[36:45.700 --> 36:48.060]  So can I ask how long?
[36:48.060 --> 36:50.100]  Do you know how many days right now?
[36:50.100 --> 36:51.540]  10 months and four days.
[36:51.540 --> 36:52.500]  Nice. Congrats, bro.
[36:52.500 --> 36:53.340]  Yeah.
[36:53.340 --> 36:54.180]  Congratulations.
[36:54.180 --> 36:55.300]  With zero problems.
[36:55.300 --> 36:57.220]  I mean, I've gone to bars with my friends
[36:57.220 --> 36:58.540]  and been holding their drinks
[36:58.540 --> 37:00.660]  while they went to the bathroom or whatever.
[37:00.660 --> 37:01.700]  And it's just-
[37:01.700 --> 37:02.540]  That's a long time.
[37:02.540 --> 37:06.340]  I have zero want for alcohol anymore.
[37:06.340 --> 37:09.860]  So some circumstances in my life caused that to happen.
[37:09.860 --> 37:12.500]  And I'm unfortunate for those circumstances,
[37:12.500 --> 37:13.780]  but I'm glad it happened.
[37:13.780 --> 37:15.500]  So we got my shit together.
[37:15.500 --> 37:16.740]  You noticed that we hang out again.
[37:16.740 --> 37:18.180]  Yeah, it was pretty cool.
[37:18.180 --> 37:19.580]  After several months of that
[37:19.580 --> 37:24.140]  and kind of changing my own attitude and my own demeanor,
[37:24.140 --> 37:26.420]  I noticed that a lot of the friends that disappeared
[37:26.420 --> 37:27.980]  started just coming back naturally.
[37:28.420 --> 37:29.260]  I wasn't having to hit them up
[37:29.260 --> 37:32.220]  and ask for their friendship or anything like that
[37:32.220 --> 37:35.580]  or wonder why we weren't hanging out.
[37:35.580 --> 37:36.820]  Everything became a lot clearer.
[37:36.820 --> 37:39.700]  So I'm doing well and I'm on a great track
[37:39.700 --> 37:41.460]  to get a whole lot of shit done.
[37:41.460 --> 37:44.020]  I was about your age when I quit drinking permanently.
[37:44.020 --> 37:46.420]  I took a break and then I went back to it
[37:46.420 --> 37:47.860]  because my environment changed.
[37:47.860 --> 37:48.700]  I went to a new area.
[37:48.700 --> 37:49.940]  My circumstances were different.
[37:49.940 --> 37:50.860]  I was like, I don't need to be...
[37:50.860 --> 37:53.780]  I was living with my band in a small apartment
[37:53.780 --> 37:55.500]  and playing with my band every night.
[37:55.500 --> 37:57.900]  There was no need for me to not get fucked up.
[37:58.820 --> 38:00.020]  And then I moved back and then I was like,
[38:00.020 --> 38:01.220]  oh, I gotta chill out on this
[38:01.220 --> 38:02.420]  getting fucked up every night.
[38:02.420 --> 38:03.300]  I can't just be out here.
[38:03.300 --> 38:05.460]  I was drinking and driving and causing problems
[38:05.460 --> 38:06.920]  and just being destructive.
[38:06.920 --> 38:09.940]  I ruined relationships and fucking probably lives
[38:09.940 --> 38:13.820]  and reputations for sure.
[38:13.820 --> 38:16.180]  And then I got sober and like you said, bro,
[38:17.100 --> 38:19.540]  some people disappeared when I got shitty drunk,
[38:19.540 --> 38:22.740]  but then other people disappeared when I got sober as well.
[38:22.740 --> 38:23.660]  Like a lot of people are like,
[38:23.660 --> 38:24.840]  oh, we're just drinking friends.
[38:24.840 --> 38:26.220]  I don't wanna be your friend unless you're sober.
[38:26.220 --> 38:27.420]  You act like you're better than me.
[38:28.340 --> 38:29.220]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[38:29.220 --> 38:31.180]  Like I didn't really get any of that reaction,
[38:31.180 --> 38:33.300]  but the people that I've seen who have disappeared
[38:33.300 --> 38:34.860]  because of that are not people
[38:34.860 --> 38:36.780]  I really wanna associate with anyway.
[38:36.780 --> 38:40.260]  Like now that I'm sober and looking at things differently,
[38:40.260 --> 38:44.580]  I just like, I have no ill will or hatred
[38:44.580 --> 38:46.060]  to say about those people.
[38:46.060 --> 38:48.420]  They're just not people I wanna hang out with
[38:48.420 --> 38:51.060]  and be around on a daily basis.
[38:51.060 --> 38:53.380]  Somebody taught me, Cliff Ravenscraft taught me
[38:53.380 --> 38:55.620]  and I can't remember, I think it was,
[38:55.620 --> 38:57.180]  it doesn't matter, but it kind of does to me
[38:57.940 --> 38:59.420]  because I like giving credit to people who taught me things.
[38:59.420 --> 39:02.260]  I think it was David, Michael Stilsner, possibly,
[39:02.260 --> 39:05.020]  but somebody from like a business type,
[39:06.420 --> 39:08.380]  inspirational type podcast taught my friend,
[39:08.380 --> 39:10.940]  Cliff Ravenscraft that you become the sum
[39:10.940 --> 39:13.580]  of the five people you choose to surround yourself with
[39:13.580 --> 39:14.740]  the most frequently.
[39:14.740 --> 39:17.020]  So think about the five people that you bring to your life,
[39:17.020 --> 39:18.140]  that you bring to your table,
[39:18.140 --> 39:19.140]  that you bring to your circle,
[39:19.140 --> 39:21.700]  five of those people that you're around the most frequently,
[39:21.700 --> 39:24.420]  you mold your personality and your lifestyle
[39:24.420 --> 39:27.160]  and your beliefs and whatever you shape to them.
[39:28.160 --> 39:30.800]  That's not coworkers, although my coworkers and I
[39:30.800 --> 39:33.320]  are such close friends that they kind of do,
[39:33.320 --> 39:35.240]  I would give them, all of them would get one
[39:35.240 --> 39:36.640]  of the collective five people.
[39:36.640 --> 39:39.320]  I would say that they all get one influence spot together.
[39:39.320 --> 39:41.320]  My work crew counts as one.
[39:41.320 --> 39:43.240]  And then whoever else you're around,
[39:43.240 --> 39:45.640]  kind of like Mike definitely has some influence
[39:45.640 --> 39:48.120]  on who I am and I definitely have influence,
[39:48.120 --> 39:49.920]  guaranteed just because we're around each other so much.
[39:49.920 --> 39:51.800]  And we choose to because we know
[39:51.800 --> 39:53.480]  that we're not gonna fuck each other over.
[39:53.480 --> 39:55.200]  We're not gonna let each other fuck up too bad.
[39:55.200 --> 39:56.440]  We're gonna say something.
[39:56.520 --> 39:57.960]  He'll let me do a little bit of dumb shit
[39:57.960 --> 39:59.120]  because he knows what I like to do
[39:59.120 --> 40:01.360]  and he knows where I like to kind of fuck up.
[40:01.360 --> 40:03.320]  But when he gets, he'll let me fuck up level three.
[40:03.320 --> 40:04.800]  But if I go level four or five, he'll be like,
[40:04.800 --> 40:07.160]  dude, hey, he'll pull the alarm.
[40:07.160 --> 40:08.000]  And I'll do the same.
[40:08.000 --> 40:09.080]  I'll call him on level two
[40:09.080 --> 40:11.360]  because he's a little, walks a tighter shit than I.
[40:11.360 --> 40:12.200]  I don't let him know.
[40:12.200 --> 40:13.480]  I'd be like, bro, you're going level three.
[40:13.480 --> 40:14.800]  I've never seen you go level three.
[40:14.800 --> 40:16.200]  What are you gonna do with this?
[40:16.200 --> 40:18.080]  Like, and we'll call each other on if we need to.
[40:18.080 --> 40:19.920]  I've never seen you really fucking do anything
[40:19.920 --> 40:22.680]  really crazy before so it's hard to call you on bullshit.
[40:22.680 --> 40:23.520]  But I would if I ever had the opportunity.
[40:23.760 --> 40:24.600]  I've never had the opportunity.
[40:24.600 --> 40:25.800]  I've never tried to go off the rails too often.
[40:25.800 --> 40:27.680]  That's why we call you white Mike.
[40:27.680 --> 40:30.000]  Because if there's a rule to follow, you remind us.
[40:30.000 --> 40:32.400]  Like, guys, you shouldn't be leaving the house
[40:32.400 --> 40:34.120]  with that many pipes in the car.
[40:34.120 --> 40:35.480]  No, it's not that you shouldn't.
[40:35.480 --> 40:37.800]  It's just be aware of fucking how many months
[40:37.800 --> 40:39.320]  you're gonna have to sit in county extra
[40:39.320 --> 40:41.040]  because you took two instead of three.
[40:41.040 --> 40:42.480]  Mike and I have always had this.
[40:42.480 --> 40:43.520]  I don't know where I learned it,
[40:43.520 --> 40:45.960]  but one time Mike blurted out,
[40:45.960 --> 40:47.740]  think about the headline when you do this, bro.
[40:47.740 --> 40:49.040]  Think of what the paper is gonna say.
[40:49.040 --> 40:52.320]  That was something one of my parents was big on
[40:52.360 --> 40:53.920]  was like, before you do something,
[40:53.920 --> 40:55.920]  just imagine it as a headline.
[40:55.920 --> 40:58.920]  Like, get drunk and wrap your car around a telephone pole.
[40:58.920 --> 41:00.880]  That's not a fun headline you wanna be associated with.
[41:00.880 --> 41:03.440]  Because they're not gonna say,
[41:03.440 --> 41:07.640]  cannabis advocate who hosts show to help people grow
[41:07.640 --> 41:10.840]  accidentally crashes vehicle into tree.
[41:10.840 --> 41:13.920]  It's gonna say, fucking stoned pothead wrecks car,
[41:13.920 --> 41:15.080]  kills kittens.
[41:15.080 --> 41:18.840]  Like, the news is not, like, fluffy shit doesn't sell.
[41:18.840 --> 41:19.800]  They gotta scare you.
[41:19.800 --> 41:22.000]  No, I mean, you just think it down two steps.
[41:22.640 --> 41:23.800]  Two steps down the road.
[41:23.800 --> 41:24.640]  For sure.
[41:24.640 --> 41:27.200]  Like, your option is either everyone's gonna know you
[41:27.200 --> 41:30.320]  from a picture taken when you were being booked into jail,
[41:30.320 --> 41:33.760]  which is arguably the worst minute of your life,
[41:33.760 --> 41:35.800]  like, up to that point.
[41:35.800 --> 41:38.200]  I'm sure, like, a couple of weeks into shitty jail,
[41:38.200 --> 41:39.600]  it gets worse.
[41:39.600 --> 41:41.400]  Like, basically, that's what your mugshot is.
[41:41.400 --> 41:43.400]  Or if you're dead, they scroll to your Facebook
[41:43.400 --> 41:45.960]  and pick the most fucked up picture they can find.
[41:45.960 --> 41:47.760]  And that's you forever.
[41:47.760 --> 41:50.320]  Like, just think about some shit.
[41:50.320 --> 41:52.520]  Yeah, so, before you do anything, you guys,
[41:52.520 --> 41:53.840]  think about it, look at the headline.
[41:53.840 --> 41:55.680]  Those awesome dab videos in the car
[41:55.680 --> 41:57.760]  are totally gonna be played at your trial.
[41:57.760 --> 41:58.600]  That's all I'm saying.
[41:58.600 --> 42:02.240]  So, my point was, congrats on 10 months
[42:02.240 --> 42:03.960]  and four days of sobriety, bro.
[42:03.960 --> 42:04.800]  We're proud of you.
[42:04.800 --> 42:05.640]  Keep it up.
[42:06.800 --> 42:08.560]  I work a lot, dude, but if you ever feel like
[42:08.560 --> 42:09.880]  you gotta drink to solve some problems,
[42:09.880 --> 42:11.320]  just hit me up, we'll fucking figure it out.
[42:11.320 --> 42:12.280]  We'll take some dabs.
[42:12.280 --> 42:13.120]  I appreciate that.
[42:13.120 --> 42:14.040]  We'll pour some turps on a nail.
[42:14.040 --> 42:16.480]  I appreciate that, but, like I said,
[42:16.480 --> 42:18.720]  that whole desire has kinda disappeared.
[42:18.720 --> 42:21.720]  Yeah, after a while, you wanna think about it.
[42:21.720 --> 42:26.160]  I know how much a delicious, thick, disgusting,
[42:26.160 --> 42:28.240]  dark beer with like an inch of white foam
[42:28.240 --> 42:29.240]  on the top of it.
[42:29.240 --> 42:31.880]  Oh, I know how good that would taste,
[42:31.880 --> 42:33.080]  but I know I can't do it.
[42:33.080 --> 42:35.560]  Because if I drink one, I'm gonna have about 37 of them,
[42:35.560 --> 42:37.800]  and then who knows what the fuck's gonna happen.
[42:37.800 --> 42:38.720]  It's not my thing.
[42:38.720 --> 42:40.240]  Cannabis, cannabis for everybody.
[42:40.240 --> 42:41.720]  Yeah, dabs.
[42:41.720 --> 42:43.280]  Alcohol is poison, cannabis is healing.
[42:43.280 --> 42:44.360]  I'm not judging you if you drink,
[42:44.360 --> 42:46.040]  but please don't bring it here.
[42:46.040 --> 42:47.200]  Don't share it with me.
[42:47.400 --> 42:49.480]  Ah, more on this email.
[42:49.480 --> 42:51.000]  Who else should we give them an update on?
[42:51.000 --> 42:51.960]  Who did we skip?
[42:51.960 --> 42:53.600]  They didn't ask, they said et cetera.
[42:53.600 --> 42:55.640]  So who else, Mike, how are you?
[42:55.640 --> 42:58.000]  Awesome, I'm so high.
[42:58.000 --> 42:58.840]  Ha.
[42:58.840 --> 42:59.680]  Ha.
[42:59.680 --> 43:00.520]  Ha.
[43:00.520 --> 43:01.360]  Ha.
[43:01.360 --> 43:02.200]  Life is good.
[43:02.200 --> 43:03.040]  There you go, from the horse's mouth,
[43:03.040 --> 43:04.320]  he's awesome and so high.
[43:04.320 --> 43:06.080]  He's got a beautiful young man.
[43:06.080 --> 43:07.080]  Dude, Davey's so awesome.
[43:07.080 --> 43:08.000]  He's walking.
[43:08.000 --> 43:08.840]  Yup.
[43:08.840 --> 43:10.600]  Dude, I've seen videos of him fucking walking.
[43:10.600 --> 43:11.800]  So he's got a kid that's walking.
[43:11.800 --> 43:14.320]  Now, that should put a lot of Mike's life into perspective.
[43:14.320 --> 43:15.840]  Just a few days ago, this kid stood up
[43:15.840 --> 43:17.080]  and fucking took off walking.
[43:17.960 --> 43:21.480]  Mike's life is chasing a kid that shits into a diaper
[43:21.480 --> 43:23.160]  and is trying to destroy everything
[43:23.160 --> 43:25.840]  that doesn't realize he's trying to destroy everything,
[43:25.840 --> 43:27.960]  but that's just what kids do.
[43:27.960 --> 43:30.000]  Like, oh, look at this, I'm gonna fuck it up.
[43:30.000 --> 43:31.240]  Oh, you paid money for that too?
[43:31.240 --> 43:32.080]  In the floor.
[43:32.080 --> 43:33.520]  Not accidentally kill yourself
[43:33.520 --> 43:35.520]  doesn't kick in until older, apparently.
[43:35.520 --> 43:39.320]  So yeah, it can be kind of high stress during the day.
[43:39.320 --> 43:40.160]  Yup, but Mike, it's-
[43:40.160 --> 43:41.800]  But getting away and taking some dabs
[43:41.800 --> 43:42.760]  is a really nice way to-
[43:42.760 --> 43:44.560]  He's got a great teammate and partner, though.
[43:44.560 --> 43:45.760]  Your wife is fucking awesome.
[43:45.760 --> 43:46.640]  I'm so lucky.
[43:47.160 --> 43:48.880]  Yeah, you guys are lucky that you have each other
[43:48.880 --> 43:50.800]  and so is Davey, not to sound cheesy,
[43:50.800 --> 43:52.800]  but a lot of relationships these days
[43:52.800 --> 43:55.280]  are fucking very not the way your guys' is.
[43:55.280 --> 43:56.640]  Right.
[43:56.640 --> 43:58.120]  Kevin and I can attest to that shit.
[43:58.120 --> 43:59.520]  A lot of shit is broken.
[43:59.520 --> 44:01.320]  So you guys are lucky to have all three of you
[44:01.320 --> 44:03.760]  under the same roof and giving each other hugs right now.
[44:03.760 --> 44:04.600]  Thanks, man.
[44:04.600 --> 44:07.040]  Yeah, so yeah, Mike's doing well.
[44:07.040 --> 44:07.960]  I'm fucking great.
[44:07.960 --> 44:09.520]  I'm sure you guys are doing pretty well.
[44:09.520 --> 44:11.320]  I'm trying to think, did we miss anybody?
[44:11.320 --> 44:12.560]  Well, I'm sure someone will pop up.
[44:12.560 --> 44:14.080]  If you wanna know about more people, just ask.
[44:14.080 --> 44:14.920]  We'll tell you.
[44:14.920 --> 44:16.040]  If we forgot you, you should call
[44:16.440 --> 44:17.360]  and try to be on more podcasts.
[44:17.360 --> 44:19.240]  So we'll forget you next time this comes up.
[44:19.240 --> 44:22.000]  Rob from Sour Seeds is doing well.
[44:22.000 --> 44:23.440]  Adam is doing the same old shit.
[44:23.440 --> 44:25.560]  He works at the head shop and rides a skateboard
[44:25.560 --> 44:28.160]  and smokes and fucking drinks a 40 occasionally
[44:28.160 --> 44:30.160]  and does that stuff.
[44:30.160 --> 44:31.720]  Who did the worms?
[44:31.720 --> 44:32.560]  The worms.
[44:32.560 --> 44:33.400]  Oh, Sean.
[44:33.400 --> 44:34.240]  Sean.
[44:34.240 --> 44:38.840]  Sean and I, I think, do I talk about that Sean's a new father?
[44:38.840 --> 44:41.120]  Do I say that on a show without his permission or anything?
[44:41.120 --> 44:43.360]  But Sean's a baby daddy now.
[44:43.360 --> 44:45.720]  Shout out to Sean and Killa Kelly.
[44:46.240 --> 44:47.840]  He runs a big grow also.
[44:47.840 --> 44:49.440]  That's why we don't hear from him very much.
[44:49.440 --> 44:52.120]  He's out at SandSol running that giant grow out there.
[44:52.120 --> 44:55.760]  So that's what Sean from the worm, organic as fuck.
[44:55.760 --> 44:57.320]  That's who you're thinking of.
[44:57.320 --> 44:58.840]  King Cola, Ross Cola.
[44:58.840 --> 44:59.680]  That's Sean.
[44:59.680 --> 45:00.520]  He's doing well.
[45:00.520 --> 45:01.340]  I haven't freaking talked to him for a long time.
[45:01.340 --> 45:03.640]  He just sent me a Facebook message just a few weeks ago
[45:03.640 --> 45:05.880]  saying, hey, what's up, man?
[45:05.880 --> 45:09.160]  Who else has been on the show that we should talk about?
[45:09.160 --> 45:11.640]  We shouldn't have to dig too deep.
[45:11.640 --> 45:12.680]  I don't even know.
[45:12.680 --> 45:14.600]  All right, well, if you wanna know about anybody else,
[45:14.600 --> 45:17.640]  let us know because we're high and we're going blank.
[45:17.640 --> 45:19.280]  Mike's trying to write a note or something
[45:19.280 --> 45:20.120]  because he wants to know.
[45:20.120 --> 45:22.400]  I can turn off your mic and you can say it.
[45:22.400 --> 45:24.400]  Or you can just, he looked at me like, do it.
[45:24.400 --> 45:26.160]  All right, your mic's off, go for it.
[45:27.680 --> 45:29.320]  I think my mic caught that, but.
[45:29.320 --> 45:32.640]  Fuck you think I was trying not to say it out loud for?
[45:32.640 --> 45:33.480]  I know, I know.
[45:33.480 --> 45:35.600]  Well, one of our microphones might've caught that.
[45:35.600 --> 45:38.220]  That's, who's been, there's only one, anyway.
[45:41.520 --> 45:44.000]  Yep, but anyway, so let's continue on with the email.
[45:44.360 --> 45:45.200]  If you wanna know about more people,
[45:45.200 --> 45:46.920]  just send me specifics and we'll let you know
[45:46.920 --> 45:47.760]  a bit more about them.
[45:47.760 --> 45:50.480]  Because we took dabs and we're high
[45:50.480 --> 45:53.880]  and we're forgetting stuff, apparently, obviously.
[45:54.960 --> 45:56.040]  Who sat next to you?
[45:56.040 --> 45:57.400]  Who was sat here on the show?
[45:57.400 --> 45:58.360]  Joe Buzzy.
[45:59.880 --> 46:02.200]  Joe moved to the East Coast and is consulting
[46:02.200 --> 46:04.000]  and running a large grill out there.
[46:05.040 --> 46:06.080]  He's kind of a private dude,
[46:06.080 --> 46:07.240]  so I'm not even gonna say where he is.
[46:07.240 --> 46:08.320]  I probably shouldn't have said
[46:08.320 --> 46:10.160]  the two names together like that.
[46:11.600 --> 46:13.480]  You're thinking about people have sat in certain chairs
[46:13.920 --> 46:14.760]  on certain episodes you've been on.
[46:14.760 --> 46:15.580]  That's what I was doing also.
[46:15.580 --> 46:17.200]  I was doing the episode 100
[46:17.200 --> 46:19.440]  and I think we've hit everybody that was on that episode.
[46:19.440 --> 46:20.640]  Tall Clint.
[46:20.640 --> 46:22.520]  Tall Clint, the comedian.
[46:22.520 --> 46:24.360]  Clint's not doing as much comedy anymore.
[46:24.360 --> 46:26.240]  He's working, he's a family man.
[46:26.240 --> 46:28.080]  He's getting his shit together.
[46:28.080 --> 46:29.960]  That's what Clint is always,
[46:29.960 --> 46:32.360]  just trying to be a better dude, a better dad.
[46:32.360 --> 46:33.560]  He's all over the social media.
[46:33.560 --> 46:34.920]  Check him out at Tall Clint.
[46:36.080 --> 46:37.320]  Wade's back in Pueblo.
[46:37.320 --> 46:39.160]  Wade was on the show once.
[46:39.160 --> 46:40.600]  He's a comedian again, still.
[46:40.600 --> 46:41.840]  I don't know, I didn't talk to him for a while.
[46:41.840 --> 46:42.880]  He moved, he left.
[46:44.320 --> 46:45.640]  And he didn't do any social media,
[46:45.640 --> 46:47.260]  but now he's back and he's got a comedy show
[46:47.260 --> 46:50.440]  somewhere in town on 710, I believe, in Pueblo.
[46:50.440 --> 46:52.160]  I think that's June 10th.
[46:52.160 --> 46:53.480]  Oh, 610.
[46:53.480 --> 46:54.640]  Okay.
[46:54.640 --> 46:57.080]  Fuck, it would have been a lot cooler if it was 710.
[46:57.080 --> 46:59.160]  All right, I know a good way to,
[46:59.160 --> 47:01.000]  just to get a quick refresher to see
[47:01.000 --> 47:03.760]  who else we might want to mention,
[47:03.760 --> 47:07.160]  because I can just scroll through the podcast feed
[47:07.160 --> 47:08.880]  and see, this is the long way of doing it.
[47:08.880 --> 47:10.000]  We'll just scroll through the feed
[47:10.000 --> 47:13.360]  and see who's on there.
[47:14.200 --> 47:15.400]  Apparently I was listening to the Spliff podcast
[47:15.400 --> 47:17.440]  the last time I used my iTunes here,
[47:17.440 --> 47:19.800]  or my Apple podcast.
[47:19.800 --> 47:21.840]  We're not supposed to say iTunes and podcast together
[47:21.840 --> 47:23.520]  anymore, you're supposed to say Apple podcast.
[47:23.520 --> 47:25.240]  It's a new thing that Apple's doing.
[47:25.240 --> 47:26.440]  Not sure what's going on there.
[47:26.440 --> 47:27.440]  It's kind of creepy.
[47:28.840 --> 47:30.140]  Haven't heard from Tony in a little bit.
[47:30.140 --> 47:31.580]  He was on an episode a long time ago.
[47:31.580 --> 47:33.320]  He's a new father also.
[47:33.320 --> 47:35.160]  Everyone's got a lot of shit going on.
[47:38.360 --> 47:40.360]  Jesse, Mike.
[47:40.360 --> 47:42.880]  It's Jesse and Mike most of the time.
[47:43.640 --> 47:44.480]  Jesse and Mike.
[47:44.480 --> 47:46.140]  So it seems like everybody has been covered, you guys.
[47:46.140 --> 47:47.680]  We just rambled for a long time,
[47:47.680 --> 47:49.400]  trying to think about, oh, Sammy.
[47:49.400 --> 47:50.760]  Sammy's doing well.
[47:50.760 --> 47:51.600]  Sammy's a parent.
[47:51.600 --> 47:52.840]  Sammy's running a big grow.
[47:54.040 --> 47:55.240]  I didn't see what just happened over there,
[47:55.240 --> 47:57.120]  but those dudes are fucking throwing stuff.
[47:57.120 --> 47:58.840]  Dabs, Dabs happened.
[47:58.840 --> 48:00.480]  Dabbing Granny, we talked about her.
[48:00.480 --> 48:02.280]  Mike, Jesse, barefoot.
[48:02.280 --> 48:03.880]  Will's doing well.
[48:03.880 --> 48:06.360]  He was in North Carolina, went to go visit some family.
[48:06.360 --> 48:08.240]  Dude's getting married.
[48:08.240 --> 48:11.040]  Congrats to Will and Rachel.
[48:11.080 --> 48:14.200]  And their new vehicle, they just put together
[48:14.200 --> 48:17.160]  the coolest, is it a Bronco, a Blazer?
[48:18.040 --> 48:19.000]  I think it's a Bronco.
[48:19.000 --> 48:19.840]  It's old.
[48:19.840 --> 48:20.660]  It's an old Bronco.
[48:20.660 --> 48:21.500]  Yeah, and it's cool.
[48:21.500 --> 48:22.340]  It's dope.
[48:22.340 --> 48:23.160]  It's got that old school flair.
[48:23.160 --> 48:24.000]  He bought one that was beat up,
[48:24.000 --> 48:25.360]  and then he polished it up himself,
[48:25.360 --> 48:26.720]  and it looks fucking sweet.
[48:27.760 --> 48:28.840]  Everything's going well for that kid.
[48:28.840 --> 48:30.920]  He just paid off a giant debt.
[48:30.920 --> 48:32.240]  So barefoot's having a good time.
[48:32.240 --> 48:34.000]  Things are doing well for that guy.
[48:35.200 --> 48:36.640]  Cat and Coot from the Mystic Roots
[48:36.640 --> 48:38.520]  just had a beautiful baby.
[48:38.520 --> 48:39.360]  I think that's enough.
[48:39.360 --> 48:40.600]  We don't need to talk about too much else.
[48:41.160 --> 48:42.600]  If you want to know about someone specific, hit me up.
[48:42.600 --> 48:43.760]  I probably missed somebody.
[48:43.760 --> 48:44.960]  If we missed you, sorry.
[48:44.960 --> 48:46.000]  We had a lot of fucking people in there.
[48:46.000 --> 48:47.120]  How are you doing?
[48:47.120 --> 48:47.960]  How you doing?
[48:47.960 --> 48:48.800]  You doing okay?
[48:48.800 --> 48:49.760]  You doing all right?
[48:49.760 --> 48:51.800]  That's what I want to know.
[48:51.800 --> 48:52.720]  I just made it weird.
[48:52.720 --> 48:54.200]  Anyway, the email goes on to say,
[48:54.200 --> 48:55.520]  I'd love a hoodie or a t-shirt
[48:55.520 --> 48:57.200]  if you've still got any of those available.
[48:57.200 --> 48:58.040]  How do I get one?
[48:58.040 --> 48:58.880]  I've got both available.
[48:58.880 --> 49:00.360]  I just need to know what size you wear,
[49:00.360 --> 49:01.400]  and then I'll tell you how much they cost.
[49:01.400 --> 49:02.400]  Send me an email.
[49:02.400 --> 49:04.160]  Growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[49:04.160 --> 49:05.080]  I'll let you know all about them.
[49:05.080 --> 49:06.080]  They're affordable.
[49:06.080 --> 49:08.800]  The most expensive part of the fucking hoodies is shipping.
[49:08.840 --> 49:10.840]  They're big, and I put them in the priority mailbox
[49:10.840 --> 49:13.880]  as it costs like 17 bucks to ship those things,
[49:13.880 --> 49:15.560]  but I'll give you the hoodie at a reasonable price
[49:15.560 --> 49:17.320]  since you're a podcast listener,
[49:17.320 --> 49:19.000]  and I'll give you a hoodie and a t-shirt
[49:19.000 --> 49:20.520]  at a very much more reasonable price.
[49:20.520 --> 49:21.800]  I'll try to stuff them in the same box.
[49:21.800 --> 49:24.000]  Hopefully it fits, but send me an email.
[49:24.000 --> 49:25.280]  I may have your size.
[49:25.280 --> 49:26.120]  I'm not sure.
[49:26.120 --> 49:27.360]  I'd have to go look in the box.
[49:27.360 --> 49:28.200]  I can see the box.
[49:28.200 --> 49:29.040]  Everyone's staring at the box like,
[49:29.040 --> 49:30.240]  man, they're right there.
[49:30.240 --> 49:31.080]  You should just go look and see
[49:31.080 --> 49:32.600]  if you've got her size or his size,
[49:32.600 --> 49:34.200]  and I don't know if I do,
[49:34.200 --> 49:35.640]  but let's see.
[49:35.640 --> 49:37.080]  More of the email goes on.
[49:37.120 --> 49:39.080]  All right, I think I made this email long enough.
[49:39.080 --> 49:40.320]  Ha, of course I'm stoned.
[49:40.320 --> 49:41.480]  Hey, so are we.
[49:41.480 --> 49:43.480]  Took 50 minutes to get through this email.
[49:43.480 --> 49:45.280]  Thanks for the entire episode worth of content.
[49:45.280 --> 49:46.480]  I do appreciate that.
[49:46.480 --> 49:47.320]  Then you go on to say,
[49:47.320 --> 49:48.160]  I just really appreciate you,
[49:48.160 --> 49:51.280]  and I've donated to your Patreon to show my support.
[49:51.280 --> 49:52.760]  Rock on, that's awesome.
[49:52.760 --> 49:53.600]  I appreciate that.
[49:53.600 --> 49:54.520]  Let me know, send me a message,
[49:54.520 --> 49:57.260]  and let me know what your username is on Patreon.
[49:58.240 --> 49:59.920]  Maybe I owe you a shirt.
[49:59.920 --> 50:00.760]  I'm not sure.
[50:00.760 --> 50:01.720]  A couple of people have done some things
[50:01.720 --> 50:03.920]  that I probably should give them some stuff
[50:03.920 --> 50:05.960]  to say thank you, like t-shirts or stickers or something,
[50:05.960 --> 50:07.120]  because people have been helping me out,
[50:07.120 --> 50:08.560]  and I appreciate that.
[50:08.560 --> 50:10.640]  You say, I'd prefer you use my email handle
[50:10.640 --> 50:12.240]  instead of my name if you,
[50:12.240 --> 50:14.120]  fuck, I did it again.
[50:14.120 --> 50:15.820]  Okay, I'll use your email handle,
[50:15.820 --> 50:17.640]  but now I gotta go back and edit this one also.
[50:17.640 --> 50:21.280]  This makes me think that my idea last time is a good one.
[50:21.280 --> 50:23.880]  Just instead of, hey, Ross, Jeff,
[50:23.880 --> 50:27.000]  just in bold letters, do, or you're allowed to,
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  or you're not allowed to use my name on the show
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.360]  just to make it easier on poor Jeff here.
[50:31.360 --> 50:32.640]  I don't even know if I'm using the right.
[50:32.640 --> 50:34.440]  I'm just gonna fucking cut out all the names,
[50:34.440 --> 50:35.480]  because it just says use that,
[50:36.000 --> 50:37.240]  and then it doesn't show another name.
[50:37.240 --> 50:40.040]  Their email handle and their name are the same thing.
[50:40.040 --> 50:42.920]  So I'm not sure, but I'm just gonna cut that out
[50:42.920 --> 50:43.760]  just in case.
[50:43.760 --> 50:47.200]  So beep, yeah, I apologize for using your name.
[50:47.200 --> 50:48.080]  I'll fix it.
[50:48.080 --> 50:50.720]  I'll just put fucking noise over it or something.
[50:50.720 --> 50:52.840]  I'll record a big burp and just put that over
[50:52.840 --> 50:54.520]  every time I say someone's name.
[50:54.520 --> 50:56.280]  Just fart into the mic and play that for it,
[50:56.280 --> 50:58.680]  because that's how I feel every time I do it.
[50:58.680 --> 50:59.680]  Thanks for the long email.
[50:59.680 --> 51:00.500]  I appreciate it.
[51:00.500 --> 51:01.840]  You guys, don't let me discourage you
[51:01.840 --> 51:03.280]  with my blatant fuck-ups here.
[51:03.280 --> 51:04.120]  Send me more emails.
[51:04.120 --> 51:05.840]  Growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[51:05.840 --> 51:08.240]  I'll read your email, and I won't say your name.
[51:08.240 --> 51:10.020]  I won't bust you out so that everybody knows
[51:10.020 --> 51:10.900]  you're growing cannabis.
[51:10.900 --> 51:12.480]  I apologize for that.
[51:12.480 --> 51:13.520]  We're taking dabs here.
[51:13.520 --> 51:14.720]  We're not doing rocket surgery,
[51:14.720 --> 51:16.600]  so sometimes we slip up on some stuff.
[51:16.600 --> 51:18.040]  A little bit.
[51:18.040 --> 51:19.000]  A little bit.
[51:19.000 --> 51:19.840]  A little bit.
[51:19.840 --> 51:21.200]  You just say a little bit.
[51:21.200 --> 51:23.240]  With all this stuff on the table,
[51:23.240 --> 51:25.000]  I'm impressed we didn't melt anything
[51:25.000 --> 51:26.680]  when we were dabbing a minute ago.
[51:26.680 --> 51:27.520]  Just using the torch with the mics.
[51:27.520 --> 51:29.760]  That's a lot of open flames and a lot of flammable,
[51:29.760 --> 51:32.400]  meltable stuff that all survived intact.
[51:32.400 --> 51:34.100]  Let's remind the listeners that one time,
[51:34.940 --> 51:37.780]  I heated up a nail and passed Mike the rig and a dab,
[51:37.780 --> 51:40.220]  and Mike put his mouth on the microphone like this,
[51:40.220 --> 51:42.940]  or her, and tried to inhale through the microphone
[51:42.940 --> 51:44.460]  and pressed the dab onto the nail
[51:44.460 --> 51:46.260]  and wondered why it wasn't working.
[51:47.180 --> 51:49.220]  Looked at the dab confused and wondering
[51:49.220 --> 51:51.100]  why it was still vaporizing into the air
[51:51.100 --> 51:53.140]  instead of inhaling through the microphone.
[51:53.140 --> 51:55.780]  Oh, moved my mouth to the left on the other dick-shaped piece
[51:55.780 --> 51:57.660]  and moved his mouth over and started sucking
[51:57.660 --> 51:59.380]  and just went about it like, that's how it works.
[51:59.380 --> 52:00.460]  Okay, I got it now.
[52:01.420 --> 52:02.860]  I figured it out.
[52:02.860 --> 52:03.700]  We survived.
[52:05.460 --> 52:06.420]  I'll never forget that.
[52:06.420 --> 52:07.700]  And you're not the only one that's done it.
[52:07.700 --> 52:09.740]  No, I'm not the only one that's done it.
[52:09.740 --> 52:12.220]  The microphone dab happens here.
[52:12.220 --> 52:14.620]  A lot of great shit has happened at this table.
[52:14.620 --> 52:16.300]  I gave Charlie McMullen a dab.
[52:16.300 --> 52:18.100]  Tori, he sweated about a bucket of water
[52:18.100 --> 52:19.140]  right where you're sitting.
[52:19.140 --> 52:20.460]  You dabbed Jesse out.
[52:20.460 --> 52:21.300]  I dabbed Jesse.
[52:21.300 --> 52:23.500]  Tori took a nap on that couch over there.
[52:23.500 --> 52:25.420]  Inaya Luhan from the Haunted Wind Chimes
[52:25.420 --> 52:27.260]  took a little surprise nap on the floor.
[52:27.260 --> 52:28.940]  He was trying to walk outside to get fresh air
[52:28.940 --> 52:30.660]  and he looked at me and his eyes rolled back in his head
[52:30.700 --> 52:32.180]  and I caught him and laid him on the floor
[52:32.180 --> 52:33.620]  in the living room.
[52:33.620 --> 52:35.340]  Yeah, Wade and I carried him out to a chair
[52:35.340 --> 52:36.620]  out on the outside and he's like,
[52:36.620 --> 52:39.500]  I just need a cigarette was all he kept saying.
[52:39.500 --> 52:41.140]  And we gave him a cigarette and he was fucking fine
[52:41.140 --> 52:41.980]  after he lit up.
[52:41.980 --> 52:43.260]  He took like two drags off that cigarette
[52:43.260 --> 52:45.060]  and he turned the right color again.
[52:45.060 --> 52:46.500]  As close to the right color as he gets.
[52:46.500 --> 52:48.660]  He's color changes.
[52:48.660 --> 52:50.860]  At one point we did an episode
[52:50.860 --> 52:53.420]  about edible consumption and dosing
[52:53.420 --> 52:55.260]  and right after somebody emailed you
[52:55.260 --> 52:56.620]  it was like, fuck bro.
[52:57.580 --> 52:59.500]  The numbers you gave me just ruined.
[52:59.500 --> 53:00.860]  I think it was the dude's wife.
[53:00.860 --> 53:02.700]  Yes, wrecked his girlfriend real bad
[53:02.700 --> 53:03.540]  and made her scared.
[53:03.540 --> 53:05.020]  When I read that I laughed.
[53:05.020 --> 53:07.820]  I felt legitimately bad for that person
[53:07.820 --> 53:09.300]  or that person's wife.
[53:09.300 --> 53:10.660]  But I also laughed really hard
[53:10.660 --> 53:12.660]  because I remember when we were recording that episode
[53:12.660 --> 53:14.580]  as soon as you started giving specific numbers
[53:14.580 --> 53:15.980]  I was like, oh dude, he's gonna ruin
[53:15.980 --> 53:17.980]  some poor dude in Carolina.
[53:17.980 --> 53:19.740]  Whoops, I apologize for that again.
[53:19.740 --> 53:21.980]  That was a long time ago and I still feel bad for it.
[53:21.980 --> 53:23.500]  We have some fun here but.
[53:23.500 --> 53:25.500]  It's not my goal is to wreck people.
[53:25.500 --> 53:27.380]  Sometimes, at this table my goal is to wreck people.
[53:27.380 --> 53:29.300]  On the podcast my goal is to help people.
[53:30.060 --> 53:31.060]  If you come here you better fucking be prepared
[53:31.060 --> 53:32.460]  to get an Uber home.
[53:32.460 --> 53:34.140]  Yeah, if you're listening from afar
[53:34.140 --> 53:36.060]  and wanna come here and try some of this stuff
[53:36.060 --> 53:38.340]  just bring a friend and go slow.
[53:38.340 --> 53:40.780]  Yeah, I feel the same way.
[53:40.780 --> 53:45.260]  I try to sesh with people and just, nope.
[53:45.260 --> 53:47.860]  I try to smoke with some friends sometimes.
[53:47.860 --> 53:49.220]  We'll go places and sesh out
[53:49.220 --> 53:51.380]  and with new people that I've known.
[53:51.380 --> 53:53.660]  I took a half gram dab in front of people the other day
[53:53.660 --> 53:56.420]  and then they didn't even wanna dab with me after that.
[53:56.420 --> 53:57.260]  I'm good, I'm good.
[53:57.260 --> 53:59.060]  And I was like, I'm not gonna give you one like that.
[53:59.820 --> 54:00.660]  Look how little it is.
[54:00.660 --> 54:01.940]  No, I'm good, I saw what you did.
[54:01.940 --> 54:02.900]  And I'm like, what?
[54:02.900 --> 54:05.020]  You don't even wanna dab after just watching me do?
[54:05.020 --> 54:06.900]  Okay, all right then.
[54:06.900 --> 54:08.140]  People get scared.
[54:08.140 --> 54:09.220]  But hey, come hang out.
[54:09.220 --> 54:10.060]  We're not afraid.
[54:10.060 --> 54:11.260]  Come take some dabs with us.
[54:11.260 --> 54:12.780]  It's not a competition.
[54:12.780 --> 54:14.580]  You don't have to keep up or anything.
[54:14.580 --> 54:15.820]  Just have fun.
[54:15.820 --> 54:17.340]  Yeah, come have fun with us.
[54:17.340 --> 54:19.500]  Take some dabs in Colorado.
[54:19.500 --> 54:20.340]  If you're in Colorado,
[54:20.340 --> 54:21.660]  experience Pueblo. It's legal, it's not mandatory.
[54:21.660 --> 54:23.140]  There's a lot of cool places we can go.
[54:23.140 --> 54:26.460]  Take some dabs legally, safely, congregate.
[54:26.460 --> 54:28.380]  Kev, where were you hanging out taking dabs?
[54:28.380 --> 54:29.220]  You were talking about that.
[54:29.220 --> 54:30.660]  One of the smoke lounges.
[54:30.660 --> 54:34.020]  Yesterday I was up at the dab lounge on Circle
[54:34.020 --> 54:35.140]  up in Colorado Springs.
[54:35.140 --> 54:35.980]  Oh, I like that place.
[54:35.980 --> 54:36.820]  I love that place.
[54:36.820 --> 54:39.340]  Is that where Mr. Ben Verbeck hangs out and manages?
[54:39.340 --> 54:40.180]  Yes, yes.
[54:40.180 --> 54:41.540]  Shout out to Ben Lee Verbeck.
[54:41.540 --> 54:43.460]  I always run into awesome people there.
[54:43.460 --> 54:45.500]  I always meet new awesome people there.
[54:45.500 --> 54:48.940]  It's a great community, great vibe in that place.
[54:48.940 --> 54:52.140]  You can go play pool and take your dabs.
[54:52.140 --> 54:53.900]  And for me, that's like,
[54:53.900 --> 54:56.100]  it gets very little better than that.
[54:56.100 --> 54:56.940]  There you go.
[54:57.060 --> 54:57.900]  I hung out with-
[54:57.900 --> 55:00.780]  I haven't wanted to go to a dab lounge in a long time
[55:00.780 --> 55:02.540]  and that just sold the fuck out of me.
[55:02.540 --> 55:04.460]  I hung out with Jeff Tate and Emma Arnold
[55:04.460 --> 55:05.780]  in the dab lounge one day
[55:05.780 --> 55:07.980]  because they're semi-famous comedians.
[55:07.980 --> 55:10.780]  If you know comedy, you know Jeff Tate and Emma Arnold
[55:10.780 --> 55:12.140]  and nobody came to their comedy show.
[55:12.140 --> 55:13.380]  There's like 20 people there.
[55:13.380 --> 55:15.020]  They're getting some really good names,
[55:15.020 --> 55:16.980]  some good shows coming through the dab lounge.
[55:16.980 --> 55:19.820]  So if anybody's wanting to hit some comedy shows,
[55:19.820 --> 55:22.220]  you can usually get pretty good prices in that place
[55:22.220 --> 55:24.460]  and you can go do dabs and watch comedy.
[55:24.460 --> 55:25.660]  Like what?
[55:25.660 --> 55:26.500]  Why not?
[55:27.060 --> 55:29.260]  You gotta be 21 and up and you gotta not be a dickhead.
[55:29.260 --> 55:30.700]  That's the only rule.
[55:30.700 --> 55:31.540]  Yeah.
[55:31.540 --> 55:32.380]  And watch out for people's dogs.
[55:32.380 --> 55:33.460]  That's the only thing I don't like is people,
[55:33.460 --> 55:34.700]  they bring their fucking dogs in there
[55:34.700 --> 55:35.540]  and let them roam around.
[55:35.540 --> 55:37.060]  I don't think that's legit.
[55:37.060 --> 55:39.220]  I'm trying to smoke and trying to not dodge a dog.
[55:39.220 --> 55:40.060]  Why you gotta bring a dog to a dab lounge?
[55:40.060 --> 55:41.020]  Because they're fucking a bunch of hippies.
[55:41.020 --> 55:41.900]  It's Colorado Springs.
[55:41.900 --> 55:43.300]  Yeah, it is.
[55:44.260 --> 55:46.260]  Bunch of fucking hat pin wearing wooks.
[55:48.180 --> 55:49.260]  I like the Cana Canyon.
[55:49.260 --> 55:50.460]  Oh, it's truly a dog fair.
[55:50.460 --> 55:51.700]  And that's one cool thing
[55:51.700 --> 55:53.100]  about having different smoke lounges.
[55:53.100 --> 55:55.500]  I am not dissing the dab lounge by any means.
[55:55.540 --> 55:56.980]  None of these places pay us.
[55:56.980 --> 55:59.460]  I go to different places for different reasons.
[55:59.460 --> 56:02.180]  The dab lounge, he said you can play pool.
[56:02.180 --> 56:03.340]  They have a bar there.
[56:03.340 --> 56:04.180]  Not a bar.
[56:04.180 --> 56:05.380]  They have TVs there.
[56:05.380 --> 56:07.860]  It's like a sports bar environment in one area.
[56:07.860 --> 56:11.980]  There's a stage there for comedy or for bands to play on.
[56:11.980 --> 56:15.460]  It's got several rooms with different types of vibes
[56:15.460 --> 56:17.740]  or it can be kind of, it depends on how they set it up.
[56:17.740 --> 56:20.260]  It could be one big room or multiple rooms,
[56:20.260 --> 56:21.340]  but it's loud in there.
[56:21.340 --> 56:22.900]  It's a lot of movement.
[56:22.900 --> 56:24.460]  It's kind of chaotic.
[56:24.460 --> 56:26.220]  There's a lot of shit going on,
[56:26.220 --> 56:28.140]  which sometimes I want to do.
[56:28.140 --> 56:30.700]  We did the Veteran Farmers Alliance event in there
[56:30.700 --> 56:32.260]  and it was chaotic and I had a good time
[56:32.260 --> 56:33.140]  because that's what I went for.
[56:33.140 --> 56:34.260]  I saw the comedy show in there.
[56:34.260 --> 56:35.100]  It was chaotic.
[56:35.100 --> 56:35.940]  It was a good time.
[56:35.940 --> 56:38.780]  Sometimes I want to kick it and record a podcast
[56:38.780 --> 56:40.060]  and talk to the three of you.
[56:40.060 --> 56:41.900]  The Cana Canyon is where you go for that.
[56:41.900 --> 56:43.260]  There's a couple of couches.
[56:43.260 --> 56:44.220]  There's a table.
[56:44.220 --> 56:45.660]  There are no TVs.
[56:45.660 --> 56:47.740]  It's a living room you can stop by.
[56:47.740 --> 56:49.180]  I love it that there are no TVs.
[56:49.180 --> 56:51.220]  The music is at a level to where I was able
[56:51.220 --> 56:52.780]  to record a podcast without saying,
[56:52.820 --> 56:54.740]  hey, can you turn that down just a smidge?
[56:54.740 --> 56:56.420]  It was a smidge down already.
[56:56.420 --> 56:57.260]  It was perfect.
[56:57.260 --> 56:58.140]  Just background noise.
[56:58.140 --> 56:59.420]  You could talk over it.
[56:59.420 --> 57:00.820]  You didn't have to speak up.
[57:02.060 --> 57:03.660]  Camille is a wonderful decorator.
[57:03.660 --> 57:05.420]  I would assume Camille decorated that place.
[57:05.420 --> 57:06.380]  It screams of Camille.
[57:06.380 --> 57:09.020]  The paint, the colors are natural.
[57:09.020 --> 57:09.860]  It's not white.
[57:09.860 --> 57:11.220]  It's not white and orange.
[57:11.220 --> 57:13.540]  It's not red, gold, and green like a Rasta place.
[57:13.540 --> 57:16.980]  It looks like a classy, contemporary lady design
[57:16.980 --> 57:18.100]  sort of place and it's chill.
[57:18.100 --> 57:18.940]  I like it.
[57:18.940 --> 57:19.940]  It looks like they went to Ikea
[57:19.940 --> 57:21.580]  and got fresh, clean furniture.
[57:21.580 --> 57:23.980]  There's another place on the south side of Springs
[57:23.980 --> 57:25.680]  that I'm not gonna mention by name,
[57:25.680 --> 57:27.640]  but it looks like they got all their fucking shit
[57:27.640 --> 57:29.640]  at the furniture or at the thrift store.
[57:29.640 --> 57:30.480]  And when I go in there,
[57:30.480 --> 57:32.940]  I don't like letting my shirt touch the couch.
[57:32.940 --> 57:33.780]  Whatever the arc.
[57:33.780 --> 57:36.140]  I don't like, I keep my dreadlocks far,
[57:36.140 --> 57:37.500]  far away from their furniture.
[57:37.500 --> 57:40.520]  It's scuzzy in there and I've only been there twice.
[57:40.520 --> 57:41.740]  Once I went in there to check it out,
[57:41.740 --> 57:43.300]  once another friend wanted to go and I was like,
[57:43.300 --> 57:44.660]  here, this is why I don't go.
[57:44.660 --> 57:45.900]  Let's go check it out.
[57:45.900 --> 57:47.740]  And they were like, oh, this is scuzzy.
[57:47.740 --> 57:49.620]  And I was like, yep, let's fucking bail from here
[57:49.620 --> 57:51.140]  and go to the Cannon Canyon.
[57:51.460 --> 57:53.300]  So there's, depending on what you're looking for,
[57:53.300 --> 57:54.860]  there are different places.
[57:54.860 --> 57:57.380]  What's the one, there are the two places together,
[57:57.380 --> 57:59.460]  the Lion and then what's next to the Lion?
[57:59.460 --> 58:00.900]  Isn't that Studio 64?
[58:00.900 --> 58:02.680]  That's another spot that's a totally different place
[58:02.680 --> 58:04.260]  with a totally different atmosphere
[58:04.260 --> 58:05.540]  and a totally different environment.
[58:05.540 --> 58:08.460]  It's smaller, it's more tighter, it's more compact,
[58:08.460 --> 58:12.020]  but it's got a, yeah, good laughter, Mike.
[58:12.020 --> 58:15.140]  It's got a different vibe than any of the other places
[58:15.140 --> 58:16.740]  and it's got glass all around it.
[58:16.740 --> 58:17.940]  So it was an old bar.
[58:17.940 --> 58:20.100]  So all the windows you can see in and out.
[58:20.100 --> 58:21.580]  The other places you can't see in and out.
[58:21.580 --> 58:23.520]  I kind of like the privacy.
[58:24.540 --> 58:27.580]  There's one, I can't, the Vape Lounge, the Speakeasy,
[58:27.580 --> 58:29.740]  the Speakeasy Vape Lounge.
[58:29.740 --> 58:34.260]  That place has pool tables, music, bars,
[58:34.260 --> 58:39.260]  like a dab bar, a band, pool, fucking foosball, video games.
[58:39.940 --> 58:41.680]  It's got everything going on in there.
[58:41.680 --> 58:44.380]  It's really cool, but it's too fucking much for my brain
[58:44.380 --> 58:45.620]  after a few dabs.
[58:45.620 --> 58:47.860]  Just pinball in one corner, pool in another corner.
[58:47.860 --> 58:49.780]  It's like being in a small arcade and trying to dab
[58:50.460 --> 58:51.380]  and it just makes you go nuts.
[58:51.380 --> 58:53.500]  But there's something for everybody is my point.
[58:53.500 --> 58:55.500]  I like that there are so many options.
[58:55.500 --> 58:56.940]  So if you want to go be chaotic,
[58:56.940 --> 58:57.980]  if you want to go talk quietly,
[58:57.980 --> 58:59.420]  there's a place we can go do it.
[58:59.420 --> 59:01.920]  Yep, that's what I was getting at.
[59:01.920 --> 59:03.820]  You guys got anything else to say while we're on a podcast?
[59:03.820 --> 59:05.780]  Since you've got, I won't even say how many people
[59:05.780 --> 59:06.620]  are listening.
[59:06.620 --> 59:07.700]  There are a lot of people listening.
[59:07.700 --> 59:12.620]  Recently we've been in the top 100 on the lifestyle
[59:12.620 --> 59:16.100]  and culture and the society and culture tabs in Stitcher.
[59:16.100 --> 59:18.260]  We've been in the top 100 several times.
[59:18.260 --> 59:20.660]  We've been as high as number 70 and 68
[59:20.660 --> 59:22.300]  in a couple of the tabs.
[59:22.300 --> 59:24.860]  We have not reached in the education tab yet,
[59:24.860 --> 59:25.820]  but that's a hard one to do.
[59:25.820 --> 59:27.700]  A lot of people beat us out of that one.
[59:27.700 --> 59:30.100]  But just to be in the top 100 of anything on Stitcher
[59:30.100 --> 59:30.940]  is an honor.
[59:30.940 --> 59:32.540]  So thanks to everybody that listens to Stitcher.
[59:32.540 --> 59:34.480]  Thanks to everybody that listens on iTunes.
[59:34.480 --> 59:35.860]  I truly appreciate it.
[59:35.860 --> 59:37.260]  I asked if you guys had any shit to say
[59:37.260 --> 59:38.500]  and then I really interrupted you.
[59:38.500 --> 59:40.300]  So I'll give you the mic for a second.
[59:40.300 --> 59:42.340]  No man, I think we covered it.
[59:43.540 --> 59:44.860]  Good, thanks for having me on.
[59:44.860 --> 59:45.860]  Thanks for coming and hanging out.
[59:45.860 --> 59:46.980]  Congrats again on sobriety.
[59:46.980 --> 59:47.820]  Keep it up.
[59:48.340 --> 59:49.180]  It's always fun, man.
[59:49.180 --> 59:50.020]  It's always fun.
[59:50.020 --> 59:50.840]  It's more fun to do dabs.
[59:50.840 --> 59:51.680]  Isn't it, dude?
[59:51.680 --> 59:52.520]  You remember the next day,
[59:52.520 --> 59:53.500]  you don't wonder where your car is parked,
[59:53.500 --> 59:54.620]  you don't wonder where your wallet went,
[59:54.620 --> 59:56.420]  you don't have to chew your arm off and escape.
[59:56.420 --> 59:59.640]  Almost never find unexplained bruising.
[59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.420]  Yep, sometimes.
[01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:02.740]  Rarely.
[01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:04.380]  I mean, there's gonna be the occasional like,
[01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:07.660]  oh yeah, I branded myself with that new nail on accident,
[01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:09.020]  but that's rare.
[01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:12.620]  My health has greatly improved, so all the way around.
[01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:14.440]  That's visually noticeable, brother, man.
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:15.900]  That's visually noticeable.
[01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:16.740]  Right on.
[01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:17.560]  We can see that.
[01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:20.700]  Mike, you got anything you wanna say
[01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:23.540]  while there are a whole bunch of people listening to you?
[01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:24.620]  Keep the emails coming.
[01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:25.540]  They make good shows.
[01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:26.940]  Yes, I love the emails.
[01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:28.420]  I totally appreciate the emails.
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:31.180]  You know what else I like is iTunes ratings and reviews.
[01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:32.980]  It'd be awesome if you left me a rating
[01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:34.980]  and a review on iTunes.
[01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:35.820]  It's really easy.
[01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:36.640]  You go to the iTunes store,
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.180]  search for The Girl From Your Heart podcast.
[01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:40.140]  Right in the middle, it says ratings and reviews.
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:40.980]  Click right there.
[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:42.580]  Then right above that, it says write a review.
[01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:44.060]  Click on that, then guess what?
[01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:45.020]  Write a review.
[01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:46.340]  Let me know what you think about the show.
[01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:48.480]  I'll read your review on a future episode.
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:50.020]  Then click on a star.
[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:50.940]  There's one through five.
[01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:53.460]  So far, everybody has given me a five-star review.
[01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:56.300]  Give me as many as you feel I deserve.
[01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:57.940]  That's hard to say for some reason.
[01:00:57.940 --> 01:00:58.780]  I don't have any notes.
[01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:00.180]  I'm trying to say it off the top of my head.
[01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:01.020]  Came out funky.
[01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:01.840]  I apologize.
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:03.820]  My tongue is getting high today.
[01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:04.660]  Leave me a review.
[01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:05.500]  I would appreciate it.
[01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:07.820]  Also, let me remind you about Patreon.
[01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:09.620]  Patreon is a service where you can contribute
[01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:10.460]  to the podcast.
[01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:12.940]  All you have to do is go to patreon.com
[01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:14.780]  slash growfromyourheart.
[01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:16.820]  All of the information that you need to sign up
[01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:17.720]  will be there.
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:19.580]  I would appreciate it if you contribute.
[01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:21.660]  I appreciate everyone that has contributed.
[01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:23.100]  Thank you very much.
[01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:24.920]  I try to send everybody a personal thank you,
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:27.020]  but it looks like some of that stuff's not happening.
[01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:28.820]  I'm not getting notifications on Patreon
[01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:30.380]  until the funds are dispersed,
[01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:32.500]  at which point I'm like, how did that happen?

[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:06.240]  without pulling out a credit card
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:07.860]  or without reaching out of your pocket.
[01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:09.460]  Don't be a dick is free.

[01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:15.280]  The best way you can help out
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:19.300]  is to be a responsible legalization supporter.
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:20.140]  Yes.

[01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:25.460]  and be an example for the community.

[01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:27.780]  That's the truth.
[01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:28.740]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:34.260]  With these guns of Navarone
[01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:36.260]  I shall shoot them like Al Capone

[01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:46.260]  Like that
[01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:48.260]  Well, staring down a deadly zone against a killer on your own
[01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:50.260]  Me shoot them like particle bomb, with guns of Navarone
[01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:52.260]  Some try to reach around
[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:54.260]  And try to let me down
[01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:56.260]  And quick away to make them drown, I step up in a deadly zone
[01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:58.260]  I grab them boy one close, tell them it's good lord
[01:05:58.260 --> 01:06:00.260]  Before so do, they
[01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:02.260]  Them still got no guns, hear them rocking out
[01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:04.260]  Big guns popping out, niggas get smacked

[01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:16.260]  I'm the wrong nigga to approach like that, Holmes
[01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:18.260]  Wrong nigga for threats, low nigga with long chrome
[01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:20.260]  But we can dance till one of us drop
[01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:22.260]  You score points falling with good formation
[01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:24.260]  I'm the wrong nigga for patience, wrong when it's done
[01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:26.260]  The very last nigga you should ever blast your gun
[01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:28.260]  To the floor, acting like you going to war
[01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:30.260]  Now you fucked up, become a real rocket launcher
[01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:32.260]  Plane throw up, rule with a iron rod

[01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:42.260]  And my onion thoughts orphan
[01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:44.260]  While you be walking, foot soldier catch you at the store's corner
[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:46.260]  Keep me on your mind and don't slumber
[01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:48.260]  Man, the minute you slip with those
[01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:50.260]  That's your ass, ass
