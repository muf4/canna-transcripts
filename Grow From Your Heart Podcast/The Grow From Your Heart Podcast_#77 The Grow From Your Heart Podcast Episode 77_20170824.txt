[00:11.200 --> 00:20.520]  Welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:20.520 --> 00:24.020]  It's time for episode number 77 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:24.020 --> 00:28.020]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:28.020 --> 00:30.520]  That's right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:30.520 --> 00:32.520]  if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber,
[00:32.520 --> 00:36.520]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:36.520 --> 00:39.520]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:39.520 --> 00:40.520]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[00:40.520 --> 00:43.020]  Today, today, sorry, that was a hard word.
[00:43.020 --> 00:45.520]  Today, I am joined by our good friend, White Mike.
[00:45.520 --> 00:46.520]  How are you doing today, bro?
[00:46.520 --> 00:47.520]  I'm doing good, man. How are you?
[00:47.520 --> 00:49.520]  I'm doing good if I can get through this intro.
[00:49.520 --> 00:50.020]  Right.
[00:50.020 --> 00:51.520]  The hardest word was today.
[00:51.520 --> 00:54.520]  I've said that word a lot, so there must be something going on in my brains.
[00:54.520 --> 00:56.020]  I think there's some dab on your tongue.
[00:56.020 --> 00:58.520]  There might be, yeah, my brain might be all sticky from the dabs.
[00:58.520 --> 00:59.520]  Today is a stony Sunday.
[00:59.520 --> 01:01.520]  We are recording on June 14th.
[01:01.520 --> 01:03.020]  Happy birthday, Maya Luna.
[01:03.020 --> 01:06.020]  This episode will come out on Thursday, June 18th.
[01:06.020 --> 01:08.520]  Before we get into a lot of stuff, I want to read an iTunes comment.
[01:08.520 --> 01:11.020]  We don't get a lot of iTunes comments on the show.
[01:11.020 --> 01:13.520]  I got to say thanks to Kat and Coot from the Mystic Roots Band.
[01:13.520 --> 01:15.020]  The opening song is the Doggy Dub.
[01:15.020 --> 01:18.020]  That is from the Mystic Roots Band off the album, The Constant Struggle.
[01:18.020 --> 01:21.020]  Make sure you support the Mystic Roots Band and stay positive.
[01:21.020 --> 01:22.020]  Sound.
[01:22.020 --> 01:23.520]  Check it out. We got a new iTunes comment.
[01:23.520 --> 01:26.020]  I always love it when we get iTunes comments.
[01:26.020 --> 01:29.020]  All right. This comment is from Adrian WSK.
[01:29.020 --> 01:31.020]  And it says, this podcast rocks.
[01:31.020 --> 01:32.520]  I look forward to Mondays because of it.
[01:32.520 --> 01:35.020]  Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:35.020 --> 01:37.020]  And he gives us five stars.
[01:37.020 --> 01:38.020]  Nice. Thank you.
[01:38.020 --> 01:39.020]  Awesome. That's from Adrian.
[01:39.020 --> 01:40.020]  That could be a male or a female.
[01:40.020 --> 01:44.020]  So thanks, Adrian, whichever sexual gender you are.
[01:44.020 --> 01:45.020]  We appreciate the comment.
[01:45.020 --> 01:46.520]  You guys keep the comments coming.
[01:46.520 --> 01:48.020]  We love to see the comments on iTunes.
[01:48.020 --> 01:53.020]  And in that same theme, thanks FastBerry for the tweet.
[01:53.020 --> 01:55.020]  Thanks for following directions, man. That helps.
[01:55.020 --> 01:56.520]  Did FastBerry tweet you?
[01:56.520 --> 01:57.020]  Yep.
[01:57.020 --> 01:59.020]  Nice. Good work, dude. Thanks.
[01:59.020 --> 02:01.020]  He follows myself. He follows Jesse.
[02:01.020 --> 02:04.520]  He's definitely, and Sean also, he's definitely on top of the game.
[02:04.520 --> 02:07.020]  Thanks for supporting us, dude. That is really cool.
[02:07.020 --> 02:11.520]  I think that is all of the super important business we got to take care of.
[02:11.520 --> 02:14.020]  There are no advertisements or anything on the start of the show.
[02:14.020 --> 02:17.020]  We got the shout out taken care of for the comment.
[02:17.020 --> 02:19.020]  Yes, we did.
[02:19.020 --> 02:21.020]  So in a couple of minutes, actually, I'm going to tell you what's coming up.
[02:21.020 --> 02:23.520]  Mike is going to give us his little, not little.
[02:23.520 --> 02:26.020]  I don't say little because I don't want to downplay it.
[02:26.020 --> 02:33.020]  Mike is going to give us his great presentation about getting you into being a cannabis activist or a lobbyist
[02:33.020 --> 02:37.020]  or just getting your foot into the door to help us support cannabis legalization.
[02:37.020 --> 02:44.020]  Yep. I put together a little spiel on the quick path to step it up and help and fight for legalization in your area.
[02:44.020 --> 02:46.020]  So we'll get to that in just a second.
[02:46.020 --> 02:48.020]  This story out of Santa Ana, California.
[02:48.020 --> 02:49.020]  Yeah.
[02:49.020 --> 02:50.020]  I think I'm saying that right?
[02:50.020 --> 02:51.020]  Yes.
[02:51.020 --> 02:52.020]  Someone who is from California.
[02:52.020 --> 02:53.020]  Yeah, it's Santa Ana, California.
[02:53.020 --> 02:55.520]  So Mike tweeted this the other day.
[02:55.520 --> 02:58.520]  If you guys follow Mike or the show on Twitter or my personal Twitter.
[02:58.520 --> 03:02.020]  Possibly my most popular tweet ever.
[03:02.020 --> 03:05.020]  Yeah, dude. I got a lot of Twitter notifications because of this.
[03:05.020 --> 03:08.020]  So Mike is at Nemopunk15 on Twitter.
[03:08.020 --> 03:12.020]  I am at RastaJeff420 and the show is at GFYH Podcast.
[03:12.020 --> 03:16.020]  All of our Twitter started blowing up when this video came out.
[03:16.020 --> 03:21.020]  The title of the video is Santa Ana Pot Shop Raid Sparks Investigation.
[03:21.020 --> 03:22.020]  So I want to play the video.
[03:22.020 --> 03:25.020]  I'm pretty sure I can play this video and no one's going to get mad at me.
[03:25.020 --> 03:26.020]  This comes from YouTube.
[03:26.020 --> 03:27.020]  I'm going to play it here on the show.
[03:27.020 --> 03:30.020]  We're going to watch it and I'm going to kind of narrate it.
[03:31.020 --> 03:34.020]  It's going to be a little like a Doug Benson interruption sort of a thing here.
[03:34.020 --> 03:38.020]  We're just going to interrupt this thing and talk a bunch of shit over it and explain what's going on.
[03:38.020 --> 03:43.020]  It starts off with, I'll just, before we even hit play, it starts off with a disclaimer.
[03:43.020 --> 03:44.020]  And I want to read that to you guys.
[03:44.020 --> 03:52.020]  It says, the following video shows a raid by Santa Ana police at the Sky High Medical Marijuana Dispensary on May 27, 2015.
[03:52.020 --> 03:55.020]  The footage has been edited by the dispensary's attorneys.
[03:55.020 --> 04:01.020]  The text that appears in the portions of the video also were inserted by the attorneys to explain what they believe was occurring.
[04:01.020 --> 04:06.020]  After reviewing the photo, Santa Ana's police chief says he plans to investigate the officer's actions.
[04:06.020 --> 04:10.020]  So now I'm going to hit play and I may have to adjust the volume a couple times.
[04:10.020 --> 04:12.020]  Oh, I still got the reggae playing from the intro.
[04:12.020 --> 04:15.020]  I'm going to have to adjust the volume because it's a YouTube video and it gets choppy.
[04:15.020 --> 04:19.020]  All right, before you hit play, man, just a little background for everybody listening.
[04:19.020 --> 04:28.020]  So the city in question here decided that they were going to ban all dispensaries, at least for now.
[04:28.020 --> 04:37.020]  And there were several that had opened up already or opened up in the face of the ban and continued to operate.
[04:37.020 --> 04:46.020]  So I'm not exactly sure what steps were taken before the video starts playing by the city, but yeah, the video's nuts.
[04:46.020 --> 04:51.020]  I'm not trying to defend anything in it just to give you guys a little heads up as to what led up to the video hitting.
[04:51.020 --> 04:54.020]  True starting. All right, so I'm going to hit play now.
[04:54.020 --> 05:02.020]  And here we go. I apologize if the volume is wonky, you guys. I'll be on it quickly.
[05:02.020 --> 05:07.020]  All right. So what's happening is that's the battering ram on the front door.
[05:07.020 --> 05:12.020]  So let's hit pause and talk about this. They're battering, battering, ramming the front door.
[05:12.020 --> 05:16.020]  They're busting in the front door, right? They're hitting it with the battering ram inward.
[05:16.020 --> 05:21.020]  It is an outward pulling door. If the dude would have grabbed the handle and pulled, right, it would have opened.
[05:21.020 --> 05:24.020]  It was unlocked. It's a business that's open for business.
[05:24.020 --> 05:28.020]  The view that we're seeing is coming from a hidden camera and security cameras.
[05:28.020 --> 05:34.020]  The law enforcement tore down all the cameras during the raid, but there were hidden cameras in here at the advice of the attorney.
[05:34.020 --> 05:38.020]  So if you own a dispensary, put up some hidden cameras so that you can catch this shit if it goes on.
[05:38.020 --> 05:41.020]  But all they had to do is pull that door open and walk in.
[05:41.020 --> 05:44.020]  They were they are slam the door with the battering ram. So, all right.
[05:44.020 --> 05:48.020]  Then they finally realize, oh, we can pull. They pull the door open and they come in.
[05:51.020 --> 05:53.020]  So they're now rushing in and clearing everywhere.
[05:57.020 --> 06:00.020]  Some of them are carrying pistols. Some of them are carrying assault rifles.
[06:00.020 --> 06:04.020]  They're all in body armor. Most of them are wearing masks.
[06:04.020 --> 06:07.020]  They bust open the door of what would be the bud room.
[06:07.020 --> 06:09.020]  And the noise is just so noisy in here.
[06:09.020 --> 06:12.020]  But they start yelling, get on the fucking ground to people.
[06:12.020 --> 06:14.020]  And all these people are just customers, just shopping here.
[06:14.020 --> 06:18.020]  And they look a little confused, like, wait, we're shopping. We're not doing anything wrong.
[06:18.020 --> 06:23.020]  So I'm gonna hit play again. And the volume, the sound is terrible on this video, but it's just a security cam footage.
[06:23.020 --> 06:24.020]  So that's what we get. Here we go.
[06:27.930 --> 06:30.930]  So you're hearing, get on the fucking ground. They're throwing everybody on the ground.
[06:31.930 --> 06:35.930]  These cops got guns on everybody. Cops got masks. This one cop's got his helmet on.
[06:36.930 --> 06:38.930]  This one dude's not wearing a mask or anything.
[06:38.930 --> 06:41.930]  So then they're getting everybody out.
[06:44.930 --> 06:49.930]  They're telling the employees to turn off the music, turn off that radio, because the music's pretty loud in the shop.
[06:49.930 --> 06:56.930]  Right. I love it that all the giant guy cops are in masks and there's like a 160 pound female officer.
[06:57.930 --> 07:00.930]  And she's not in a mask. Like, what's the mask for, fellas?
[07:00.930 --> 07:03.930]  Yeah, right. She seems, the masks will come off soon.
[07:03.930 --> 07:05.930]  Yeah, they come off when all the cops, the cameras are destroyed.
[07:05.930 --> 07:09.930]  Right now, sorry, Mike can't see the screen right now, so he doesn't know what's going on, but he's seen the video enough times.
[07:10.930 --> 07:16.930]  Now they are escorting a lady out who is in a wheelchair, who I found out later after the video was posted, she is blind.
[07:16.930 --> 07:21.930]  She is blind and in a wheelchair. And they're just making them follow. They're like, follow me.
[07:21.930 --> 07:27.930]  Yeah, she has one leg and she, and yeah, she's just at the shop as a patient.
[07:28.930 --> 07:30.930]  So then it gets worse.
[07:30.930 --> 07:34.930]  Here's what, here's what they had to say about the lady with the amputated leg.
[07:34.930 --> 07:36.930]  Here's here, I'm going to make sure you guys can hear it.
[07:36.930 --> 07:41.930]  Here's what the cops are saying about it. And I've got some sound equipment trying to process it to make it sound better also.
[07:41.930 --> 07:44.930]  And this is maybe a 50 or 60 year old woman.
[07:52.100 --> 07:55.100]  So the one cop asked, did you punch that old Benita?
[07:55.100 --> 07:59.100]  And the lady cop replied, I was about to kick her in her fucking nub.
[07:59.100 --> 08:01.100]  These are the people that we pay to protect and serve us.
[08:01.100 --> 08:03.100]  These are the people that think they're doing us a service.
[08:03.100 --> 08:05.100]  In the land of the free and the home of the brave.
[08:05.100 --> 08:08.100]  These are the people that are serving and protecting the community.
[08:08.100 --> 08:11.100]  And they're talking about, did you punch that old Benita?
[08:12.100 --> 08:15.100]  It's like a 60 year old woman in a wheelchair with one leg.
[08:15.100 --> 08:16.100]  A handicapped lady.
[08:16.100 --> 08:24.100]  Yeah. Why? What law enforcement action would require you to ever physically assault a 60 year old woman in a wheelchair?
[08:24.100 --> 08:27.100]  And why would she want to kick her in her fucking nub?
[08:27.100 --> 08:30.100]  That's not any sort of law enforcement tactic.
[08:30.100 --> 08:35.100]  I'm pretty sure if we look up any law enforcement manual, kick her in her fucking nub is not in there ever.
[08:35.100 --> 08:37.100]  Nope. No. All right. I'm gonna hit play again.
[08:37.100 --> 08:39.100]  We'll find more bullshit in this.
[08:40.100 --> 08:41.100]  No, it just gets worse.
[08:43.100 --> 08:44.100]  They keep repeating it.
[08:44.100 --> 08:46.100]  Oh no, they just keep playing it from different angles.
[08:53.300 --> 08:58.300]  So then the next part is the officers climbing up onto the display cases.
[08:58.300 --> 09:01.300]  Oh, now first he's trying to pull it down with like his crowbar.
[09:01.300 --> 09:04.300]  Yeah, they're swinging at the cameras on the ceiling with a crowbar and stuff.
[09:04.300 --> 09:10.300]  Just smashing security equipment because they don't want what's about to take place to be recorded.
[09:10.300 --> 09:12.300]  Yeah, exactly.
[09:13.300 --> 09:15.300]  And they didn't realize that they were on a hidden camera, which is funny.
[09:15.300 --> 09:17.300]  This guy looked right into it one time.
[09:17.300 --> 09:19.300]  They didn't realize it was a hidden camera.
[09:19.300 --> 09:25.300]  Well, the dispenser had two layers of cameras, so cops completely missed layer number two.
[09:26.300 --> 09:28.300]  It's a nice looking shop too, wherever this place was.
[09:28.300 --> 09:30.300]  They had several jars. It's a well set up place.
[09:30.300 --> 09:32.300]  They got a nice looking menu. It's painted well. Nice hardwood floors.
[09:32.300 --> 09:34.300]  They were killing it. Looks like a good shop.
[09:34.300 --> 09:37.300]  The lobby doesn't look totally different from the one I work in.
[09:38.300 --> 09:39.300]  We, we.
[09:39.300 --> 09:40.300]  Yep.
[09:40.300 --> 09:42.300]  Shout out to the spa dispensary while this video plays.
[09:42.300 --> 09:45.300]  So the cops are now tearing down the cameras.
[09:45.300 --> 09:46.300]  It's a seven minute video, guys.
[09:46.300 --> 09:49.300]  And we're probably gonna watch the majority of it here while we talk about it.
[09:49.300 --> 09:54.300]  Now the cops are in the offices climbing up on top of the desks and the saves.
[09:54.300 --> 09:57.300]  And now they've got bolt cutters so they can cut the wires on all the shit.
[09:57.300 --> 09:59.300]  And they pull the TV down and just start cutting wires.
[09:59.300 --> 10:02.300]  And they're watching the monitor to see where the cameras are.
[10:02.300 --> 10:04.300]  Then they're sending the dudes to go cut it.
[10:04.300 --> 10:07.300]  This dude's in like full on. He looks like fucking GI Joe, bro.
[10:07.300 --> 10:09.300]  He's in full on SWAT gear. He's got a mask on.
[10:09.300 --> 10:12.300]  He's got more guns than you need for a fucking army.
[10:12.300 --> 10:16.300]  These dudes went into a dispensary where people were shopping and doing business like,
[10:16.300 --> 10:18.300]  and raided them like fucking SWAT style.
[10:18.300 --> 10:19.300]  Yep.
[10:19.300 --> 10:21.300]  Isn't there a crack house or somewhere that needed to be raided?
[10:21.300 --> 10:23.300]  Apparently not.
[10:23.300 --> 10:24.300]  Yeah.
[10:24.300 --> 10:27.300]  At this point in the video, all the furniture has been smashed.
[10:27.300 --> 10:31.300]  Desks are flipped over. The display cases are all broken open.
[10:31.300 --> 10:33.300]  They're carrying out the DVRs as evidence.
[10:33.300 --> 10:35.300]  So now here's where the video gets funny, guys.
[10:38.300 --> 10:42.300]  So they think they've broken all the cameras and disconnected the DVR.
[10:42.300 --> 10:45.300]  So they don't think anybody can see them now.
[10:45.300 --> 10:48.300]  So now all the masks come off.
[10:48.300 --> 10:49.300]  Yes. Nobody is masked.
[10:49.300 --> 10:53.300]  They are opening each jar and smelling the jars.
[10:53.300 --> 10:56.300]  One of the officers has the buds pressed up against his face,
[10:56.300 --> 10:58.300]  just like you or I would do it and smelling it.
[10:58.300 --> 11:00.300]  And then, um,
[11:03.300 --> 11:04.300]  I got to turn it down a little bit.
[11:04.300 --> 11:08.300]  And then one of the officers, that's one officer asking another for one edible, please.
[11:08.300 --> 11:11.300]  So one of the guys, I'm going to pause it right now.
[11:11.300 --> 11:13.300]  Officer that I don't know his name.
[11:13.300 --> 11:17.300]  He's wearing a white shirt with green sleeves.
[11:17.300 --> 11:20.300]  He's got a shaved head, a beard and a mustache.
[11:20.300 --> 11:21.300]  He just unwrapped a product.
[11:21.300 --> 11:24.300]  I cannot tell you that it was certainly an edible infused with cannabis,
[11:24.300 --> 11:27.300]  but his friend just said, please.
[11:27.300 --> 11:31.300]  And he unwrapped this food product and put it directly into his mouth and
[11:31.300 --> 11:37.300]  offered the second half to his other buddy who is wearing fucking cop uniform,
[11:37.300 --> 11:41.300]  dude, green pants, greenish gray pants, black police shirt,
[11:41.300 --> 11:46.300]  and a bald fucking head and some sunglasses kind of, kind of muscular handed.
[11:46.300 --> 11:47.300]  The other part to him.
[11:47.300 --> 11:48.300]  Let me see if he eats that part.
[11:49.300 --> 11:50.300]  Cut away the video cutaway.
[11:50.300 --> 11:51.300]  Yeah.
[11:51.300 --> 11:53.300]  The lawyers edited it kind of funny,
[11:54.300 --> 11:56.300]  but they just showed this fucking cop.
[11:56.300 --> 12:01.300]  That's rating the dispensary, eating the edibles from the dispensary that he's rating.
[12:01.300 --> 12:03.300]  How does that uphold the law?
[12:03.300 --> 12:04.300]  How is that justice?
[12:04.300 --> 12:05.300]  Right.
[12:05.300 --> 12:11.300]  In theory, all of these officers are on duty and they're consuming edibles and they're all contributing to each other.
[12:12.300 --> 12:13.300]  Right.
[12:13.300 --> 12:14.300]  They're all high five in and having fun.
[12:14.300 --> 12:16.300]  One of them starts playing darts at one point.
[12:16.300 --> 12:19.300]  So, so now they're just hanging out, throwing darts.
[12:20.300 --> 12:23.300]  The guy that ate the edible doesn't show any signs of being high right now yet,
[12:23.300 --> 12:26.300]  but I don't know how much time has passed.
[12:28.300 --> 12:31.300]  And they're just sitting around playing darts, texting each other.
[12:31.300 --> 12:32.300]  I don't know who they're texting, but they're all texting.
[12:32.300 --> 12:33.300]  They've got their phones out.
[12:33.300 --> 12:34.300]  They're just dicking around.
[12:34.300 --> 12:36.300]  They're all on the clock laughing.
[12:36.300 --> 12:37.300]  You can hear the giggles.
[12:37.300 --> 12:39.300]  So I think I've mostly proven my point.
[12:39.300 --> 12:42.300]  You guys, these cops rated a dispensary.
[12:42.300 --> 12:52.300]  They were complete disrespectful cunts to handicapped people, a lady in a wheelchair, a blind lady, medical marijuana patients, regular customers, employees of this business.
[12:52.300 --> 12:54.300]  They belittled all these people.
[12:54.300 --> 12:55.300]  They disrespected these people.
[12:55.300 --> 12:57.300]  They violated their civil rights.
[12:57.300 --> 13:00.300]  Then they come in and destroy this place's business.
[13:00.300 --> 13:02.300]  They probably cost them so much money.
[13:02.300 --> 13:04.300]  The store looks like shit now.
[13:04.300 --> 13:06.300]  It was beautiful when I started.
[13:06.300 --> 13:08.300]  Then to add insult to fucking injury.
[13:09.300 --> 13:12.300]  These guys are the people that we pay to protect us, to keep us safe.
[13:12.300 --> 13:19.300]  They came in and they basically robbed this place because now they're eating the products that they were supposed to destroy on camera.
[13:19.300 --> 13:20.300]  They're munching them.
[13:20.300 --> 13:21.300]  It's like laughing in our faces.
[13:21.300 --> 13:26.300]  Oh, wait, this other cop is full on, just unwrapped an edible and is grubbing it, dude.
[13:26.300 --> 13:28.300]  Just sitting at the counter, grubbing it, reading the label.
[13:28.300 --> 13:32.300]  Yeah, carrying it around with them and just munching on it like it's fucking a banana.
[13:32.300 --> 13:36.300]  If they just went balls in like that and ate these edibles and didn't get stupid high, they're pot consumers.
[13:36.300 --> 13:37.300]  They're regular consumers.
[13:37.300 --> 13:39.300]  Regular, regular consumers.
[13:39.300 --> 13:43.300]  There's so much disturbing behavior packed into such a short video.
[13:43.300 --> 13:46.300]  He's just munching it and he gave a thumbs up to somebody like, this is good.
[13:46.300 --> 13:47.300]  Yeah.
[13:47.300 --> 13:49.300]  Oh, they're bagging shit up to take home it looks like.
[13:49.300 --> 13:51.300]  Let's see if he does.
[13:51.300 --> 13:54.300]  I'm assuming that that's about what's about to happen, but I can't promise you.
[13:54.300 --> 13:56.300]  That's my presumption.
[13:56.300 --> 13:59.300]  He put something in a bag and he's walking off a camera with it.
[13:59.300 --> 14:01.300]  That doesn't look like an evidence bag to me.
[14:01.300 --> 14:03.300]  No, it was a bag from the dispensary.
[14:03.300 --> 14:06.300]  It looks like a checkout bag that I fill all day long.
[14:06.300 --> 14:08.300]  Yeah, that's ridiculous.
[14:08.300 --> 14:12.300]  You guys will try to keep you updated on what happens with the Santa Ana police.
[14:12.300 --> 14:16.300]  After that, there's definitely going to be some sort of definitely going to be.
[14:16.300 --> 14:19.300]  There's an investigation going on right now.
[14:19.300 --> 14:22.300]  The mayor is has made public comments.
[14:22.300 --> 14:23.300]  It's blowing up.
[14:23.300 --> 14:26.300]  So find the video people and share it around.
[14:26.300 --> 14:27.300]  Make sure everybody sees.
[14:27.300 --> 14:31.300]  I mean, how often do you hear, hey, it's practically legal in California, right?
[14:31.300 --> 14:33.300]  Just get your medical card, man.
[14:33.300 --> 14:36.300]  Everybody in that shop had a medical card.
[14:36.300 --> 14:38.300]  Hopefully they just sent the customers home.
[14:38.300 --> 14:41.300]  A long time ago, Mike and I, I was the manager.
[14:41.300 --> 14:43.300]  I fucking had the keys, bro.
[14:43.300 --> 14:46.300]  I used to run the only dispensary in Pueblo.
[14:46.300 --> 14:48.300]  It's pretty much my shop for a little while.
[14:48.300 --> 14:51.300]  And then Mike was my backup bud tender because I couldn't handle it all by myself.
[14:51.300 --> 14:55.300]  I was working fucking 12 hour days, six days a week and killing it.
[14:55.300 --> 14:56.300]  So I got Mike in there to help.
[14:56.300 --> 15:00.300]  And then one day they decided to come in and close us while we had customers in the building.
[15:01.300 --> 15:07.300]  Just to prove a point, Mike, do you want to tell us how they chose to come in and close our medical marijuana dispensary?
[15:08.300 --> 15:09.300]  I can't remember.
[15:09.300 --> 15:11.300]  I think it was just a regular random police officer.
[15:11.300 --> 15:16.300]  And then the city manager at the time walked up to the front door, knocked on the door.
[15:17.300 --> 15:18.300]  Security let him in.
[15:18.300 --> 15:20.300]  They asked to speak to a manager.
[15:20.300 --> 15:23.300]  The manager walked up and asked, you know, hi, what can I do for you?
[15:23.300 --> 15:27.300]  They said, hi, we're from the city of Pueblo and we've got to deliver this letter.
[15:27.300 --> 15:28.300]  Have a nice day.
[15:28.300 --> 15:29.300]  And then they turned around and left.
[15:30.300 --> 15:34.300]  The letter said, we haven't passed regulations for dispensaries yet.
[15:34.300 --> 15:35.300]  You have to close.
[15:36.300 --> 15:37.300]  And that was the end of it.
[15:37.300 --> 15:39.300]  Nobody wanted to kick any old Bonita?
[15:39.300 --> 15:40.300]  Nope.
[15:40.300 --> 15:42.300]  Yeah, no, nothing was smashed.
[15:42.300 --> 15:44.300]  They didn't have to break out the SWAT team.
[15:44.300 --> 15:50.300]  Nobody needed to protect their identity while they destroyed property in a random business.
[15:50.300 --> 15:51.300]  They didn't need to feel intimidating.
[15:51.300 --> 15:53.300]  They didn't need to waste 12 officers time.
[15:53.300 --> 15:55.300]  They didn't need to fuck up our days.
[15:55.300 --> 15:56.300]  They came in and said, you guys are fired.
[15:57.300 --> 15:59.300]  Basically, they walked in and said, you're fired.
[16:00.300 --> 16:02.300]  You need to find a new job soon is what they all walked in and said.
[16:03.300 --> 16:04.300]  And that was the end of it.
[16:04.300 --> 16:07.300]  I mean, they didn't raid or smash or steal anything.
[16:07.300 --> 16:11.300]  And yeah, there's no, absolutely no need for this on behalf of the city.
[16:11.300 --> 16:15.300]  And now we've got dispensaries 10 miles away, every direction, but not in our city.
[16:15.300 --> 16:16.300]  Right.
[16:16.300 --> 16:17.300]  Pretty stupid.
[16:17.300 --> 16:18.300]  Right on Pueblo.
[16:18.300 --> 16:19.300]  Good move there.
[16:19.300 --> 16:20.300]  So Santa Ana, what the fuck, dude?
[16:20.300 --> 16:21.300]  I want to see how this turns out.
[16:21.300 --> 16:22.300]  Don't let these cops get away with this.
[16:22.300 --> 16:32.300]  Those guys, if you sent them there to take down this dispensary because cannabis is federally illegal by eating the evidence there, they definitely committed a huge crime.
[16:32.300 --> 16:39.300]  If I had done that, if you caught me destroying evidence on camera, I'd be fucked.
[16:39.300 --> 16:47.300]  The part of the video that really pissed me off and I knew I had to share it like everywhere I possibly could was right at the end of the video.
[16:48.300 --> 16:55.300]  The fire department shows up and one of the cops shouts nice and loud and clear for the microphones fires here.
[16:55.300 --> 16:56.300]  Everybody watch your mouth.
[16:57.300 --> 16:59.300]  It's the police department and the fire department.
[16:59.300 --> 17:02.300]  They're essentially the like Batman and fucking Robin, right?
[17:03.300 --> 17:04.300]  Why?
[17:04.300 --> 17:11.300]  Why would the fire department seeing and hearing the police doing police work or business be a bad thing?
[17:11.300 --> 17:12.300]  Why?
[17:12.300 --> 17:14.300]  Why would they have to watch their mouth around the fire department?
[17:14.300 --> 17:15.300]  What's with that?
[17:15.300 --> 17:17.300]  Maybe there's something because you're stealing.
[17:17.300 --> 17:19.300]  Is it because you're eating edibles on the job?
[17:20.300 --> 17:21.300]  You can't drink on the job.
[17:21.300 --> 17:23.300]  I'm pretty sure you can't consume cannabis on the job.
[17:24.300 --> 17:31.300]  If you're a if you're a cop raiding a place, you shouldn't be consuming anything there because then you're a Hippocratic prick.
[17:31.300 --> 17:32.300]  Well, no, it's theft.
[17:33.300 --> 17:34.300]  Well, yeah, but then you're also a prick.
[17:34.300 --> 17:37.300]  Like if I punch, if I was like, Mike, you're an asshole because you smoke weed.
[17:37.300 --> 17:39.300]  I want to turn you into the police.
[17:39.300 --> 17:41.300]  And you're like, dude, you just took four dabs with me.
[17:41.300 --> 17:42.300]  I'm a Hippocratic prick.
[17:42.300 --> 17:44.300]  You're a definite hypocrite for sure.
[17:44.300 --> 17:45.300]  Yeah.
[17:45.300 --> 17:50.300]  So these cops that are going in and ruining people's lives and then they're like, oh, well, I'm going to take some of the product that I just ruined your life over.
[17:51.300 --> 17:52.300]  Right.
[17:52.300 --> 17:53.300]  That's such a fucking piece of shit person move.
[17:54.300 --> 17:56.300]  I mean, it doesn't matter what they're rating.
[17:56.300 --> 17:58.300]  They can't take or eat anything there.
[17:58.300 --> 18:01.300]  Yeah, that's I mean, no one's been convicted of a crime.
[18:02.300 --> 18:04.300]  Like they're just destroying stuff for fun.
[18:05.300 --> 18:06.300]  They're stealing for fun.
[18:06.300 --> 18:11.300]  They're sitting there eating infused cannabis, fucking candy on the job.
[18:12.300 --> 18:15.300]  What happens when a call comes in because the bank of the streets getting robbed?
[18:16.300 --> 18:23.300]  Now we've got a cop on a fucking decadose Chiba Choo stone went through the fucking streets and full body armor with a semi-automatic assault rifle.
[18:24.300 --> 18:25.300]  Please.
[18:25.300 --> 18:28.300]  Like that's the last thing anyone needs is a bunch of cops on edibles.
[18:29.300 --> 18:30.300]  That's the truth.
[18:30.300 --> 18:31.300]  All right.
[18:31.300 --> 18:32.300]  We've got almost 20.
[18:32.300 --> 18:33.300]  We've got 20 minutes right now.
[18:33.300 --> 18:34.300]  So Mike put together some notes.
[18:35.300 --> 18:36.300]  I've been asking him to do it.
[18:36.300 --> 18:39.300]  I want to get more people involved in cannabis activism.
[18:39.300 --> 18:41.300]  This video is a nice little spark.
[18:41.300 --> 18:45.300]  If you're not getting involved and you've kept your head down to this point.
[18:45.300 --> 18:48.300]  I mean, this is in California where weeds basically legal.
[18:49.300 --> 18:55.300]  They're arresting people threatening to kick an old woman in a wheelchair because she didn't hustle the fuck up fast enough.
[18:55.300 --> 18:56.300]  I mean, come on.
[18:57.300 --> 18:58.300]  It's just absolutely ludicrous.
[18:58.300 --> 19:01.300]  Everybody needs to say enough is enough and stand up.
[19:01.300 --> 19:03.300]  And we're about to tell you how to do that.
[19:03.300 --> 19:04.300]  Yeah.
[19:04.300 --> 19:05.300]  All right, guys.
[19:05.300 --> 19:09.300]  This is my good buddy, Mike, and he's going to help you guys learn how to stand up for cannabis.
[19:10.300 --> 19:11.300]  You need another drink, bro?
[19:11.300 --> 19:12.300]  I see you over there shaking your half empty bottles.
[19:13.300 --> 19:14.300]  You want a water or one of these cans?
[19:15.300 --> 19:16.300]  I'm good.
[19:16.300 --> 19:17.300]  This one's fresh.
[19:17.300 --> 19:18.300]  All right.
[19:18.300 --> 19:19.300]  We got you.
[19:19.300 --> 19:20.300]  So, all right.
[19:20.300 --> 19:23.300]  So it's time to stand up and get involved, folks.
[19:23.300 --> 19:25.300]  So how do you go about doing that?
[19:26.300 --> 19:31.300]  The first thing I would say is figure out what about cannabis you're really passionate about.
[19:32.300 --> 19:34.300]  Do you love how it relaxes you at the end of the day?
[19:35.300 --> 19:38.300]  Do you love getting nice and high and playing video games?
[19:39.300 --> 19:45.300]  Do you like the social aspect of sitting in a circle with your friends, passing a joint and talking about whatever?
[19:46.300 --> 19:48.300]  Do you enjoy different medical aspects of it?
[19:49.300 --> 19:50.300]  Does it ease your pain?
[19:50.300 --> 19:51.300]  Does it stop your seizures?
[19:52.300 --> 19:54.300]  Does it allow you to eat through the nausea of whatever?
[19:55.300 --> 19:57.300]  Is it helping fight your cancer?
[19:58.300 --> 20:00.300]  What's got you really passionate about cannabis?
[20:01.300 --> 20:02.300]  What sparks that fire?
[20:03.300 --> 20:06.300]  Because you're going to need some fire because some of this gets really dull.
[20:07.300 --> 20:11.300]  A lot of you have a sick family member that you need to fight for because they're not able to do it.
[20:12.300 --> 20:15.300]  People ask me all day long about, I have a sick friend.
[20:16.300 --> 20:18.300]  What product should I point them towards?
[20:19.300 --> 20:25.300]  I have people asking me about their pain all day or their ailments and what cannabis might do for them.
[20:25.300 --> 20:30.300]  There's a lot of people out there that know it's about a lot more than just getting high.
[20:31.300 --> 20:34.300]  But even if it's just about getting high for you, that's fine.
[20:35.300 --> 20:39.300]  Humans have enjoyed intoxicants since before we had a society.
[20:40.300 --> 20:44.300]  Even little kids spin around in circles to break free of reality for a minute and enjoy it.
[20:45.300 --> 20:46.300]  It's just something humans like.
[20:47.300 --> 20:48.300]  Cannabis is great for that.
[20:49.300 --> 20:51.300]  It's the safest intoxicant known to man.
[20:52.300 --> 20:54.300]  Every other intoxicant causes a lot of harm to your body.
[20:55.300 --> 20:56.300]  Cannabis doesn't.
[20:57.300 --> 20:58.300]  The feds have been looking for a long time, folks.
[20:59.300 --> 21:03.300]  When you start doing your research, you're going to learn that as far as intoxicants go,
[21:04.300 --> 21:07.300]  even just beer and alcohol, cannabis is far, far safer.
[21:08.300 --> 21:12.300]  If you just prefer it over alcohol, that's still a great reason to stand up and say,
[21:13.300 --> 21:14.300]  we need to legalize this in my area.
[21:15.300 --> 21:16.300]  You don't have to be super sick.
[21:17.300 --> 21:18.300]  I'm going to take a dab because Mike's got a lot to say.
[21:19.300 --> 21:20.300]  I usually don't get a dab so hard on the show.
[21:21.300 --> 21:22.300]  Keep going, bro. I like it.
[21:23.300 --> 21:24.300]  Now you've got that spark lit.
[21:25.300 --> 21:26.300]  What really turns you on about cannabis?
[21:27.300 --> 21:29.300]  It's time to start getting educated.
[21:30.300 --> 21:32.300]  You need to start learning a couple of different things.
[21:33.300 --> 21:34.300]  One, start researching cannabis.
[21:35.300 --> 21:37.300]  It's got a long and interesting history.
[21:38.300 --> 21:44.300]  At this point in time, the medical research and the research on safety for consumption,
[21:45.300 --> 21:47.300]  even if you're smoking big old fat joints all the time,
[21:48.300 --> 21:49.300]  vaporizers are a lot healthier way to consume.
[21:50.300 --> 21:51.300]  You get to skip that burning plant material.
[21:51.300 --> 21:53.300]  Even if you're puffing J's old school,
[21:54.300 --> 21:57.300]  you're not doing the kind of damage to your body that a tobacco smoker is.
[21:58.300 --> 22:00.300]  It's not a one-to-one comparison, folks.
[22:01.300 --> 22:04.300]  Get online and start learning everything you can about cannabis.
[22:05.300 --> 22:06.300]  You don't have to sit down and do it all at once.
[22:07.300 --> 22:10.300]  If you love cannabis, learning a lot about it
[22:11.300 --> 22:13.300]  and knowing that you're not killing yourself because you enjoy it,
[22:14.300 --> 22:15.300]  that's something that everybody should want to do.
[22:16.300 --> 22:18.300]  While you're learning about cannabis,
[22:18.300 --> 22:20.300]  start learning about the laws in your area.
[22:21.300 --> 22:23.300]  If you're in the United States, the internet,
[22:24.300 --> 22:29.300]  every local government, regardless of how small a town or area you live in,
[22:30.300 --> 22:31.300]  everything's online at this point.
[22:32.300 --> 22:34.300]  Find out when the meetings are happening,
[22:35.300 --> 22:37.300]  how that government's structured, if it's a city council
[22:38.300 --> 22:40.300]  or if it's a board of county commissioners or whatnot.
[22:41.300 --> 22:43.300]  Figure out when they meet and just start going to meetings.
[22:44.300 --> 22:46.300]  Sit in the back and just observe how they play out.
[22:46.300 --> 22:48.300]  One of the things that I laugh a lot about,
[22:49.300 --> 22:51.300]  the anti-pot groups down here never did this step.
[22:52.300 --> 22:54.300]  They just started showing up to meetings and shouting shit.
[22:55.300 --> 22:57.300]  When you don't know how the meetings function,
[22:58.300 --> 22:59.300]  you don't know where to put your effort.
[23:00.300 --> 23:03.300]  It's sort of like an idiot showing up the first day on the job
[23:04.300 --> 23:05.300]  and just tackling random things in the store.
[23:06.300 --> 23:09.300]  It's not helpful, no matter how much energy or passion you're throwing into it.
[23:10.300 --> 23:13.300]  If you take a couple of really long, boring nights,
[23:13.300 --> 23:15.300]  these meetings can go for two or three hours at a stint,
[23:16.300 --> 23:17.300]  and just see how they flow.
[23:18.300 --> 23:21.300]  All of them allow democratic participation.
[23:22.300 --> 23:23.300]  Any member of the public can show up,
[23:24.300 --> 23:26.300]  and if they follow a couple of really simple, easy rules,
[23:27.300 --> 23:30.300]  like sign up and then speak during the appropriate time of the meeting,
[23:31.300 --> 23:35.300]  I mean, really simple shit, you can get up and say whatever you want.
[23:36.300 --> 23:37.300]  As long as you're not cussing at somebody
[23:38.300 --> 23:39.300]  or screaming and yelling at somebody on council,
[23:40.300 --> 23:41.300]  they'll let you rant about whatever.
[23:41.300 --> 23:42.300]  They give you five full minutes, don't they?
[23:43.300 --> 23:44.300]  Maybe six.
[23:45.300 --> 23:46.300]  You get five minutes at the beginning of every meeting down here in Pueblo.
[23:47.300 --> 23:48.300]  You just sign up.
[23:49.300 --> 23:51.300]  They allow six people to sign up every meeting,
[23:52.300 --> 23:53.300]  and you can rant about whatever.
[23:54.300 --> 23:56.300]  For the most part, it's these three old guys that just show up and bitch.
[23:57.300 --> 23:58.300]  I was going to say, sometimes nobody signs up.
[23:59.300 --> 24:01.300]  Everyone on council down here has thanked me
[24:02.300 --> 24:05.300]  for breaking up the tedium of the couple of people that speak.
[24:06.300 --> 24:07.300]  They don't all agree with me,
[24:08.300 --> 24:09.300]  but they appreciate me going and saying something coherent.
[24:10.300 --> 24:11.300]  They're down to hear whatever.
[24:12.300 --> 24:14.300]  There are people that have come and spoke out about roadside memorials.
[24:15.300 --> 24:18.300]  Whatever issue interests you, you can go down and speak about.
[24:19.300 --> 24:20.300]  If your issue is cannabis,
[24:21.300 --> 24:23.300]  you can show up to your local town council.
[24:24.300 --> 24:25.300]  If you've done your homework a little bit,
[24:26.300 --> 24:27.300]  you can point out how many millions of dollars they could make
[24:28.300 --> 24:30.300]  if cannabis was legal in their area.
[24:31.300 --> 24:33.300]  If you take the time to pull the data coming out of Colorado
[24:34.300 --> 24:35.300]  and Washington State,
[24:36.300 --> 24:38.300]  it's been 18 months since we've had a legal issue.
[24:39.300 --> 24:41.300]  Recreational stores opened their doors in Colorado.
[24:42.300 --> 24:44.300]  We've got all the data we need to prove
[24:45.300 --> 24:47.300]  just how safe cannabis legalization is.
[24:48.300 --> 24:51.300]  You can have stores that adults 21 years of age or older can walk into.
[24:52.300 --> 24:54.300]  If you throw the shit in well-labeled childproof packaging,
[24:55.300 --> 24:56.300]  it's perfectly safe.
[24:57.300 --> 24:58.300]  There's no harm caused.
[24:59.300 --> 25:02.300]  There's no increase in any DUIs or teen access.
[25:03.300 --> 25:05.300]  There's so much cannabis out there anyway.
[25:06.300 --> 25:08.300]  All the stores do is change who profits from the sale
[25:09.300 --> 25:12.300]  and where a whole bunch of adults choose to go to buy their weed.
[25:13.300 --> 25:15.300]  Legalization isn't a huge earth-shattering change.
[25:16.300 --> 25:18.300]  It's just the end of a lot of stupidity.
[25:19.300 --> 25:22.300]  In Colorado, we've been keeping tally of the numbers.
[25:23.300 --> 25:24.300]  People have been watching very closely.
[25:25.300 --> 25:26.300]  This was supposed to be a nightmare.
[25:27.300 --> 25:30.300]  All of the predictions a year or two ago are laughable now.
[25:31.300 --> 25:34.300]  The local paper, the chieftain, does a shit job regularly.
[25:35.300 --> 25:36.300]  Miracle in miracles,
[25:36.300 --> 25:40.300]  they did an amazing expose on what legal marijuana did to our county.
[25:41.300 --> 25:43.300]  We sold $17 million worth of marijuana,
[25:44.300 --> 25:45.300]  and the cops can't point to a firm problem.
[25:46.300 --> 25:47.300]  It's just nuts.
[25:48.300 --> 25:49.300]  $17 million?
[25:50.300 --> 25:52.300]  There's only 150,000 people down here.
[25:53.300 --> 25:54.300]  Do the math.
[25:55.300 --> 25:56.300]  It's not like the black market died.
[25:57.300 --> 26:00.300]  It's just a huge number of people prefer going to the stores.
[26:01.300 --> 26:03.300]  Buying weed on the black market can be a nightmare, man.
[26:03.300 --> 26:04.300]  We're so spoiled in Colorado,
[26:05.300 --> 26:07.300]  it's hard to think back to what it used to be like.
[26:08.300 --> 26:12.300]  A lot of people have a hardcore dealer that they've got to deal with.
[26:13.300 --> 26:15.300]  They operate under dealer rules.
[26:16.300 --> 26:17.300]  You meet in a parking lot, it's a quick exchange.
[26:18.300 --> 26:19.300]  You're not friends.
[26:20.300 --> 26:21.300]  You get ripped off.
[26:22.300 --> 26:23.300]  The bag's light.
[26:24.300 --> 26:25.300]  It's got other crap in it.
[26:26.300 --> 26:27.300]  It's never the strain they say.
[26:28.300 --> 26:29.300]  Cops looking to arrest you for doing it.
[26:30.300 --> 26:31.300]  I had some friends in from Wisconsin.
[26:31.300 --> 26:32.300]  They're friends of a friend.
[26:33.300 --> 26:34.300]  My good friend had family in from Wisconsin.
[26:35.300 --> 26:36.300]  They're like, we went to the dispensary over here.
[26:37.300 --> 26:38.300]  I was like, oh, you went there and paid?
[26:39.300 --> 26:40.300]  They're like, yeah, they wanted to go to that place
[26:41.300 --> 26:42.300]  because they heard a lot about it and wanted to see what it was like.
[26:43.300 --> 26:45.300]  They just wanted the experience of going through the store.
[26:46.300 --> 26:47.300]  I keep going.
[26:48.300 --> 26:49.300]  I'm getting you off track now.
[26:50.300 --> 26:51.300]  Get educated.
[26:52.300 --> 26:53.300]  Learn the laws in your area, how the public meetings work,
[26:54.300 --> 26:56.300]  and when and how public comment is taken.
[26:57.300 --> 26:58.300]  Then look up other legalization groups in your area.
[26:59.300 --> 27:00.300]  There are a ton of groups out there.
[27:01.300 --> 27:04.300]  In the 1970s, we were really close to marijuana being legal, too.
[27:05.300 --> 27:07.300]  When that fell apart, a number of groups started forming nationally.
[27:08.300 --> 27:09.300]  Normal's the big one.
[27:10.300 --> 27:11.300]  That's what I just wrote down.
[27:12.300 --> 27:13.300]  If you're not familiar with normal,
[27:14.300 --> 27:16.300]  you really, really need to start Googling stuff about cannabis.
[27:17.300 --> 27:19.300]  That's the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
[27:20.300 --> 27:21.300]  Yes, it is.
[27:22.300 --> 27:23.300]  It's a big organization.
[27:23.300 --> 27:24.300]  There's also the Marijuana Policy Project.
[27:25.300 --> 27:26.300]  They're doing national lobbying for legalization.
[27:27.300 --> 27:28.300]  They've helped write a number of the laws.
[27:29.300 --> 27:30.300]  I think they helped with Colorado's.
[27:31.300 --> 27:32.300]  They helped with Alaska's.
[27:33.300 --> 27:35.300]  They've written a number of other medical marijuana laws.
[27:36.300 --> 27:37.300]  They're a really big organization.
[27:38.300 --> 27:39.300]  Check them out, guys.
[27:40.300 --> 27:41.300]  Students for a Sensible Drug Policy is on pretty much
[27:42.300 --> 27:43.300]  every college campus in America.
[27:44.300 --> 27:46.300]  LEAP, Law Enforcement Against Prohibition.
[27:47.300 --> 27:48.300]  Guys, this is excellent.
[27:49.300 --> 27:50.300]  It's a great organization.
[27:50.300 --> 27:51.300]  Law Enforcement Against Prohibition.
[27:52.300 --> 27:56.300]  This is ex-cops, ex-DEA agents, judges, lawyers
[27:57.300 --> 28:00.300]  that through experience have learned just how pointless
[28:01.300 --> 28:04.300]  marijuana prohibition is and have begun calling for legalization.
[28:05.300 --> 28:06.300]  They're a great group, guys.
[28:07.300 --> 28:08.300]  Follow them on social media.
[28:09.300 --> 28:10.300]  Some of their YouTube videos are great.
[28:11.300 --> 28:13.300]  Learning, okay, so I'm going to start going out
[28:14.300 --> 28:15.300]  and speaking for legalization.
[28:16.300 --> 28:17.300]  What the fuck does that look like?
[28:18.300 --> 28:19.300]  Do I just go to city council and go,
[28:20.300 --> 28:21.300]  Weeeeee!
[28:22.300 --> 28:23.300]  Or what do I do?
[28:24.300 --> 28:25.300]  Pull up LEAP's videos on YouTube, man.
[28:26.300 --> 28:28.300]  This guy, Peter Crist is his name.
[28:29.300 --> 28:31.300]  Pull him up on YouTube and just watch him destroy
[28:32.300 --> 28:34.300]  the idea of prohibition in 15 minutes.
[28:35.300 --> 28:36.300]  It's a great place to start, guys.
[28:37.300 --> 28:40.300]  And the last organization I'd say everybody needs to check out
[28:41.300 --> 28:42.300]  is a group called Flex Your Rights.
[28:43.300 --> 28:44.300]  If you're going to go and start speaking up about
[28:45.300 --> 28:47.300]  marijuana legalization in an area where
[28:47.300 --> 28:49.300]  it's not already medically legal
[28:50.300 --> 28:51.300]  or there's not a number of other people doing that,
[28:52.300 --> 28:53.300]  it can be terrifying.
[28:54.300 --> 28:56.300]  And one of the things that's really going to help you feel
[28:57.300 --> 28:58.300]  a lot more secure in doing that
[28:59.300 --> 29:00.300]  is knowing what your rights are as a citizen
[29:01.300 --> 29:02.300]  in the good old United States of America.
[29:03.300 --> 29:06.300]  Flex Your Rights is an organization of defense attorneys
[29:07.300 --> 29:09.300]  that have put together a number of great videos
[29:10.300 --> 29:14.300]  and little training webpages on flexing your rights.
[29:15.300 --> 29:16.300]  What rights do you have when the cop pounds you
[29:17.300 --> 29:19.300]  on your door and says, open up, police.
[29:20.300 --> 29:21.300]  What can you do?
[29:22.300 --> 29:23.300]  We should all watch that anyway.
[29:24.300 --> 29:25.300]  Everyone that's listening right now should pull up these videos.
[29:26.300 --> 29:27.300]  What are your rights when you get pulled over
[29:28.300 --> 29:29.300]  during a traffic stop?
[29:30.300 --> 29:32.300]  If you get on YouTube and watch some of the same shit I do,
[29:33.300 --> 29:35.300]  you've seen people refuse to roll their window down
[29:36.300 --> 29:38.300]  and just hand or put up IDs to the window
[29:39.300 --> 29:41.300]  and completely refuse what the cop's saying
[29:42.300 --> 29:43.300]  and just do something different.
[29:44.300 --> 29:45.300]  And the cops all look befuddled
[29:45.300 --> 29:47.300]  and one cop walks over, tells the other cops
[29:48.300 --> 29:49.300]  they don't get to smash the window
[29:50.300 --> 29:51.300]  and they don't get to ruin this guy's night
[29:52.300 --> 29:53.300]  and the guy's free to leave.
[29:54.300 --> 29:55.300]  Learn how to do that legally.
[29:56.300 --> 29:58.300]  I know it's terrifying to stand up in front of the police chief
[29:59.300 --> 30:00.300]  because the police chief's at a lot of these meetings,
[30:01.300 --> 30:02.300]  the city council's at these meetings,
[30:03.300 --> 30:05.300]  the city attorney, everyone's in a suit and tie,
[30:06.300 --> 30:07.300]  there are cameras rolling, and you're going to stand up
[30:08.300 --> 30:10.300]  and encourage them to legalize marijuana
[30:11.300 --> 30:12.300]  or to push for legalization.
[30:13.300 --> 30:14.300]  It can be really scary,
[30:15.300 --> 30:16.300]  but if you know your rights
[30:17.300 --> 30:18.300]  and you've paid attention in the meetings
[30:19.300 --> 30:20.300]  and you know how they flow
[30:21.300 --> 30:22.300]  and you make your argument at the appropriate time,
[30:23.300 --> 30:24.300]  the appropriate way,
[30:25.300 --> 30:26.300]  they're going to hear you,
[30:27.300 --> 30:28.300]  they're going to be impressed,
[30:29.300 --> 30:30.300]  and they're going to want to know more.
[30:31.300 --> 30:32.300]  And so if you've done your homework and you're educated,
[30:33.300 --> 30:34.300]  when they come up to you after the meeting
[30:35.300 --> 30:36.300]  and go, I like what you said, can we sit down later?
[30:37.300 --> 30:38.300]  I want to hear about what pot legalization might do
[30:39.300 --> 30:41.300]  for our little town here in Kentucky.
[30:42.300 --> 30:44.300]  You can go to lunch later and really explain,
[30:45.300 --> 30:46.300]  I mean, look at Colorado,
[30:47.300 --> 30:48.300]  towns this size that allowed this many shops,
[30:49.300 --> 30:50.300]  made this much in tax revenue,
[30:51.300 --> 30:52.300]  this much in application fees,
[30:53.300 --> 30:54.300]  they spent this much in enforcement,
[30:55.300 --> 30:56.300]  and so they're able to spend an extra this much
[30:57.300 --> 30:58.300]  on their roads this year.
[30:59.300 --> 31:02.300]  When you make that argument to someone in local government,
[31:03.300 --> 31:05.300]  they're going to just be astounded
[31:06.300 --> 31:07.300]  at the possibilities.
[31:08.300 --> 31:10.300]  They're going to have to look at this issue in a new way.
[31:11.300 --> 31:12.300]  $17 million is an issue.
[31:12.300 --> 31:13.300]  Pueblo is a poor town.
[31:14.300 --> 31:16.300]  Half the people down here are on some form of assistance.
[31:17.300 --> 31:19.300]  It's actually like 60%.
[31:21.300 --> 31:24.300]  The median income down here is like 14 grand a year.
[31:25.300 --> 31:27.300]  Yeah, Jeff just looked at me a little horrified.
[31:28.300 --> 31:29.300]  I was a little shocked too.
[31:30.300 --> 31:32.300]  And yeah, it's a big city full of a lot of people
[31:33.300 --> 31:34.300]  and hard times.
[31:35.300 --> 31:36.300]  So this industry has been huge.
[31:37.300 --> 31:39.300]  The jobs, the local investment in the city.
[31:40.300 --> 31:41.300]  Hop on the train,
[31:42.300 --> 31:43.300]  go to the Chieftain.
[31:44.300 --> 31:45.300]  If you go to thechieftain.com
[31:46.300 --> 31:47.300]  and scroll all the way down to the bottom of the page
[31:48.300 --> 31:49.300]  on the right-hand side,
[31:50.300 --> 31:51.300]  they've got a couple of big exposés they've done,
[31:52.300 --> 31:53.300]  and one of them is called The Growing Trade.
[31:54.300 --> 31:55.300]  Or I suppose you could just Google
[31:56.300 --> 31:57.300]  The Chieftain, The Growing Trade.
[31:58.300 --> 31:59.300]  It brings up a big series of reports,
[32:00.300 --> 32:01.300]  and they break down what the police had to say
[32:02.300 --> 32:04.300]  after the county sold $17 million in pot last year,
[32:05.300 --> 32:07.300]  what the teachers had to say and the principals,
[32:08.300 --> 32:09.300]  what the fire department had to say.
[32:09.300 --> 32:11.300]  They tallied up what the county spent on enforcement
[32:12.300 --> 32:13.300]  and going out and making sure that you met zoning
[32:14.300 --> 32:15.300]  and that you were checking IDs and all of that.
[32:16.300 --> 32:17.300]  They added up everything they could think of
[32:18.300 --> 32:19.300]  that was related to legal pot,
[32:20.300 --> 32:21.300]  and they tallied it in one column,
[32:22.300 --> 32:23.300]  and it was like $220,000,
[32:24.300 --> 32:26.300]  and they pulled in $1.7 million.
[32:27.300 --> 32:29.300]  I mean, that's a million and a half in the black.
[32:30.300 --> 32:31.300]  It's a huge return on a small investment.
[32:32.300 --> 32:34.300]  Yeah, I mean, all they had to do was get out of the way.
[32:35.300 --> 32:36.300]  And I also think that we're bringing more people here
[32:36.300 --> 32:37.300]  because I know we're bringing people here.
[32:38.300 --> 32:40.300]  Colorado's seeing a flood of people coming.
[32:41.300 --> 32:42.300]  It's almost like the gold rushes before.
[32:43.300 --> 32:44.300]  We're not just moving, but visiting.
[32:45.300 --> 32:46.300]  They're coming to just to come buy a bag of weed
[32:47.300 --> 32:48.300]  and go on a hike.
[32:49.300 --> 32:50.300]  Lots of people coming to visit and checking out,
[32:51.300 --> 32:52.300]  and what I'm hoping they all take home
[32:53.300 --> 32:54.300]  is when they get home,
[32:55.300 --> 32:56.300]  they need to tell everyone they know
[32:57.300 --> 32:59.300]  how sane and rational this decision was.
[33:00.300 --> 33:01.300]  I mean, a lot of people were shocked.
[33:02.300 --> 33:03.300]  Oh, my God, you're going to add another $1 million?
[33:04.300 --> 33:05.300]  I mean, I think that's a huge investment.
[33:06.300 --> 33:07.300]  You're going to add another legal intoxicant to the mix.
[33:08.300 --> 33:09.300]  It's going to be terrible for society.
[33:10.300 --> 33:11.300]  I mean, marijuana's never killed anyone.
[33:12.300 --> 33:13.300]  Alcohol kills almost 100,000 people a year,
[33:14.300 --> 33:15.300]  and that's before the car crashes.
[33:16.300 --> 33:18.300]  Tobacco kills almost half a million people every year,
[33:19.300 --> 33:23.300]  and that's from getting diseases from using and dying.
[33:24.300 --> 33:25.300]  Police kill more people than cannabis.
[33:26.300 --> 33:28.300]  500 already this year,
[33:29.300 --> 33:31.300]  just because I know that's that off the top of my head.
[33:32.300 --> 33:34.300]  Peanuts kill more people than cannabis every year.
[33:34.300 --> 33:35.300]  Lightning kills 52 Americans a year.
[33:36.300 --> 33:38.300]  I just had to look that shit up recently.
[33:39.300 --> 33:40.300]  All right, we're getting off track here.
[33:41.300 --> 33:42.300]  Keep going, dude, because you've got quite a bit of shit.
[33:43.300 --> 33:44.300]  We've gone 36 minutes.
[33:45.300 --> 33:46.300]  I want to make sure you get this in.
[33:47.300 --> 33:48.300]  All right, so we're passionate.
[33:49.300 --> 33:50.300]  We're educated.
[33:51.300 --> 33:52.300]  We've started attending meetings
[33:53.300 --> 33:54.300]  and figuring out how they work.
[33:55.300 --> 33:56.300]  All right, so you're going to start speaking out.
[33:57.300 --> 33:58.300]  This is the terrifying part.
[33:59.300 --> 34:00.300]  It's easy to sit at home and Google
[34:01.300 --> 34:02.300]  does cannabis cure cancer
[34:02.300 --> 34:05.300]  and then read what Dr. Tashkin has to say about that
[34:06.300 --> 34:07.300]  or to Google the history of cannabis
[34:08.300 --> 34:09.300]  and spend the night reading about
[34:10.300 --> 34:12.300]  how the federal government's run a medical marijuana program.
[34:13.300 --> 34:14.300]  Every year I've fucking been alive.
[34:15.300 --> 34:16.300]  It started in 1982.
[34:17.300 --> 34:18.300]  People, they mail people 11 ounces of weed.
[34:19.300 --> 34:20.300]  How the fuck did you not know about this?
[34:21.300 --> 34:22.300]  Google it right now, but that's easy.
[34:23.300 --> 34:24.300]  It's not scary.
[34:25.300 --> 34:26.300]  No one's going to follow you home from that,
[34:27.300 --> 34:28.300]  but going down to city council
[34:29.300 --> 34:30.300]  and standing up at the podium
[34:30.300 --> 34:32.300]  and swearing in, giving your name and address
[34:33.300 --> 34:35.300]  and then speaking out for legalization can be scary,
[34:36.300 --> 34:38.300]  but if you do it right, you're going to succeed.
[34:39.300 --> 34:40.300]  People are going to hear you.
[34:41.300 --> 34:42.300]  No one's going to follow you home.
[34:43.300 --> 34:44.300]  It's even like an extra layer of protection
[34:45.300 --> 34:47.300]  because if the cops are going to screw with the person
[34:48.300 --> 34:49.300]  that's going to city council and making a stink,
[34:50.300 --> 34:51.300]  it's going to be press.
[34:52.300 --> 34:53.300]  And do the cops want press?
[34:54.300 --> 34:55.300]  They're going to bring the district attorney
[34:56.300 --> 34:57.300]  and the cops do not need any press right now.
[34:58.300 --> 34:59.300]  No, they don't want any of this.
[35:00.300 --> 35:01.300]  They don't need any of that.
[35:02.300 --> 35:03.300]  So they pretty much leave you alone.
[35:04.300 --> 35:05.300]  I've never had an issue and I've been doing this
[35:06.300 --> 35:07.300]  for like six years now.
[35:08.300 --> 35:09.300]  So what you got to do is figure out
[35:10.300 --> 35:12.300]  what you want to say and how you want to say it.
[35:13.300 --> 35:15.300]  Are you talking about medical access?
[35:16.300 --> 35:18.300]  Are you talking about full blown legalization?
[35:19.300 --> 35:20.300]  Take a few minutes
[35:21.300 --> 35:24.300]  and really pen out what you want to say.
[35:25.300 --> 35:26.300]  Make a couple of bullet point notes
[35:27.300 --> 35:28.300]  of the points you want to hit
[35:28.300 --> 35:29.300]  and practice it a couple of times at home.
[35:30.300 --> 35:31.300]  Get yourself familiar with it
[35:32.300 --> 35:33.300]  because it can be really nerve wracking.
[35:34.300 --> 35:35.300]  I hate public speaking.
[35:36.300 --> 35:37.300]  I'm nervous sitting here on the podcast
[35:38.300 --> 35:39.300]  and I love it in your kitchen.
[35:40.300 --> 35:41.300]  You'll get shaky the first time,
[35:42.300 --> 35:43.300]  but I hear a lot of people get shaky
[35:44.300 --> 35:45.300]  and city council knows they look at you like it's all right.
[35:46.300 --> 35:47.300]  They're used to it.
[35:48.300 --> 35:49.300]  And if you're struggling,
[35:50.300 --> 35:51.300]  they'll even like, it's okay.
[35:52.300 --> 35:53.300]  You can say whatever you want.
[35:54.300 --> 35:55.300]  You can't get in trouble here.
[35:56.300 --> 35:57.300]  Like they try to reassure you a little bit,
[35:58.300 --> 35:59.300]  practice it a couple of times at home
[36:00.300 --> 36:01.300]  and then go down to the meeting
[36:02.300 --> 36:04.300]  or just throw on clean clothes.
[36:05.300 --> 36:06.300]  Like that's the key people.
[36:07.300 --> 36:08.300]  You don't have to dress way up.
[36:09.300 --> 36:10.300]  I go in jeans and a button down shirt.
[36:11.300 --> 36:12.300]  Stick your head up.
[36:13.300 --> 36:14.300]  Take off your hat.
[36:15.300 --> 36:16.300]  If you've got dreads, tie them back neat.
[36:17.300 --> 36:18.300]  If you've got a big beard,
[36:19.300 --> 36:20.300]  maybe clean it up a little bit,
[36:21.300 --> 36:22.300]  but just clean clothes look nice.
[36:23.300 --> 36:24.300]  You don't have to go buy a suit or anything.
[36:25.300 --> 36:26.300]  Honestly, there are some guys that come in there
[36:26.300 --> 36:27.300]  and they're wearing their work uniform.
[36:28.300 --> 36:29.300]  And they're like, Hey, I'm part of this union.
[36:30.300 --> 36:31.300]  And you're like, Oh, I could tell.
[36:32.300 --> 36:33.300]  And we feel this way.
[36:34.300 --> 36:35.300]  And I think that that shows that they're a working fucking man
[36:36.300 --> 36:37.300]  and that they're speaking about what they've got to do.
[36:38.300 --> 36:39.300]  You know what I mean?
[36:40.300 --> 36:41.300]  Right.
[36:41.300 --> 36:42.300]  If you're coming straight from work,
[36:43.300 --> 36:44.300]  it's perfectly appropriate to show up
[36:45.300 --> 36:46.300]  in whatever you were wearing at work that day.
[36:47.300 --> 36:48.300]  People do that all the time
[36:49.300 --> 36:50.300]  because most of these meetings are like six o'clock at night.
[36:51.300 --> 36:52.300]  And that's pretty much when everybody's headed home.
[36:53.300 --> 36:54.300]  If you've got a normal job.
[36:54.300 --> 36:55.300]  Get yourself cleaned up a little bit.
[36:56.300 --> 36:57.300]  Practice what you're going to say.
[36:58.300 --> 36:59.300]  Then go down, sign up and say it.
[37:00.300 --> 37:01.300]  So, yeah, throw on a clean shirt,
[37:02.300 --> 37:03.300]  go down, sign up and speak.
[37:04.300 --> 37:05.300]  Be polite.
[37:06.300 --> 37:08.300]  I like to start off with good evening, council.
[37:09.300 --> 37:11.300]  I think going like gentlemen and lady
[37:12.300 --> 37:13.300]  makes you sound like a dick.
[37:14.300 --> 37:15.300]  So if there's men and women on the council,
[37:16.300 --> 37:17.300]  you can just skip all of that nonsense
[37:18.300 --> 37:19.300]  with good evening, council
[37:20.300 --> 37:21.300]  or good evening, Board of County Commissioners.
[37:22.300 --> 37:23.300]  Just use their formal title
[37:24.300 --> 37:25.300]  and try to say and then at the end,
[37:26.300 --> 37:27.300]  try to say thank you for you.
[37:28.300 --> 37:29.300]  Thank you for giving me this chance to speak tonight.
[37:30.300 --> 37:31.300]  They really appreciate it when people thank them
[37:32.300 --> 37:33.300]  and hang out at the meeting.
[37:34.300 --> 37:35.300]  Like that's the part that everyone,
[37:36.300 --> 37:37.300]  regardless of their issue, skips.
[37:38.300 --> 37:39.300]  The night you go speak at the meeting,
[37:40.300 --> 37:42.300]  nine times out of ten,
[37:43.300 --> 37:45.300]  when the section of time
[37:46.300 --> 37:47.300]  where the public can speak is over,
[37:48.300 --> 37:49.300]  everyone in the meeting shuffles out.
[37:50.300 --> 37:51.300]  The city council down here
[37:52.300 --> 37:53.300]  even pauses for a minute to allow it to happen.
[37:54.300 --> 37:56.300]  But the very next step of the meeting
[37:57.300 --> 37:58.300]  is council commentary.
[37:59.300 --> 38:00.300]  Well, where they sit and banter back and forth
[38:01.300 --> 38:03.300]  for a few minutes about what they just heard
[38:04.300 --> 38:05.300]  and about other shit that's come up that week.
[38:06.300 --> 38:09.300]  And that's the important part of the meeting
[38:10.300 --> 38:12.300]  if you're arguing with them about anything,
[38:13.300 --> 38:15.300]  knowing the issues city council cares about,
[38:16.300 --> 38:18.300]  knowing the different projects
[38:19.300 --> 38:20.300]  they're working on in the city,
[38:21.300 --> 38:22.300]  knowing out of the hundreds of emails
[38:22.300 --> 38:23.300]  they get each week,
[38:24.300 --> 38:26.300]  which one or two they choose to bring up at city council
[38:27.300 --> 38:28.300]  as though it's a folksy fucking antidote.
[38:29.300 --> 38:32.300]  Like knowing that stuff helps you structure your argument.
[38:33.300 --> 38:34.300]  Maybe it'll help you figure out
[38:35.300 --> 38:37.300]  which one of those council members is on your side.
[38:38.300 --> 38:39.300]  You can kind of buddy up with them.
[38:40.300 --> 38:41.300]  Especially after you've spoken
[38:42.300 --> 38:43.300]  because they frequently discuss
[38:44.300 --> 38:45.300]  what they heard that night before.
[38:46.300 --> 38:47.300]  And I can't tell you how many times I've heard,
[38:48.300 --> 38:49.300]  I wish the person who spoke earlier
[38:50.300 --> 38:51.300]  was still in this room
[38:52.300 --> 38:53.300]  and still speaking out, you know,
[38:54.300 --> 38:55.300]  when we know it's tough to do and da da da da.
[38:56.300 --> 38:57.300]  The last one was this really sweet kid.
[38:58.300 --> 38:59.300]  He was super nervous.
[39:00.300 --> 39:01.300]  He kept stopping.
[39:02.300 --> 39:03.300]  I heard him talking before the meeting.
[39:04.300 --> 39:05.300]  He didn't have a stammer.
[39:06.300 --> 39:07.300]  He fully had a stammer while he was testifying.
[39:08.300 --> 39:09.300]  And he was talking about the homeless problem down here.
[39:10.300 --> 39:11.300]  And he left immediately after he spoke.
[39:12.300 --> 39:14.300]  And the council spent maybe 20 minutes
[39:15.300 --> 39:17.300]  debating the issue and gathering city,
[39:18.300 --> 39:19.300]  or asking the city manager about resources
[39:20.300 --> 39:21.300]  to help the kid with his issue
[39:22.300 --> 39:23.300]  and address some of the issues the kid brought up.
[39:24.300 --> 39:25.300]  And it would have been great if he was there for that.
[39:26.300 --> 39:27.300]  But he was already gone.
[39:28.300 --> 39:29.300]  He was gone and I doubt he'll pull it up online later.
[39:30.300 --> 39:31.300]  I've been there when they've called upon you
[39:32.300 --> 39:33.300]  to answer a cannabis question.
[39:34.300 --> 39:35.300]  They're like, Michael, are you here?
[39:36.300 --> 39:37.300]  Or the one guy's like, that guy over there knows, let him speak.
[39:38.300 --> 39:39.300]  And you just stand up and you're like, the answer is this.
[39:40.300 --> 39:41.300]  And the people look at you like you're a fucking robot.
[39:42.300 --> 39:44.300]  So become, you guys can all become that guy for council.
[39:45.300 --> 39:47.300]  And don't expect it to happen overnight.
[39:48.300 --> 39:50.300]  I've been watching Mike do this for probably eight years.
[39:50.300 --> 39:51.300]  It takes a lot of time, folks.
[39:52.300 --> 39:54.300]  When you first go, at best,
[39:55.300 --> 39:57.300]  you're the articulate guy talking about weed.
[39:58.300 --> 40:00.300]  The fifth time you go and speak,
[40:01.300 --> 40:03.300]  you're the really articulate guy who comes to meetings
[40:04.300 --> 40:05.300]  and knows what he's talking about.
[40:06.300 --> 40:07.300]  And he really seems to know, you know,
[40:08.300 --> 40:09.300]  he's presenting an argument in a way
[40:10.300 --> 40:11.300]  that a lot of people are really starting to listen to.
[40:12.300 --> 40:14.300]  And after the first year or so,
[40:15.300 --> 40:17.300]  you're the person they think of when that issue comes up.
[40:17.300 --> 40:19.300]  I should get ahold of that guy and ask him
[40:20.300 --> 40:21.300]  what his take on this issue is.
[40:22.300 --> 40:24.300]  Now I get two or three calls a week from reporters down here.
[40:25.300 --> 40:28.300]  Sometimes fact-checking a story they're doing.
[40:29.300 --> 40:31.300]  Sometimes asking for my take on an issue.
[40:32.300 --> 40:33.300]  I'm forever running to the news
[40:34.300 --> 40:35.300]  or running to the newsstand to grab a paper.
[40:36.300 --> 40:37.300]  Like, it's just something that comes up
[40:38.300 --> 40:39.300]  after you start doing it for a while.
[40:40.300 --> 40:41.300]  We'll be in the car and both of our phones will ring
[40:42.300 --> 40:44.300]  and it's the same reporter texting his both like, bleep, bleep.
[40:44.300 --> 40:45.300]  Do you know someone who can blank
[40:46.300 --> 40:47.300]  and we both look at each other and chuckle?
[40:48.300 --> 40:49.300]  Yeah. What's the answer to this odd cannabis question?
[40:50.300 --> 40:51.300]  I've been in the car with Mike
[40:52.300 --> 40:53.300]  and city council members have called him.
[40:54.300 --> 40:55.300]  He's like, turn down the music, dude.
[40:56.300 --> 40:57.300]  I got the reggae full blast.
[40:58.300 --> 40:59.300]  And he's like, this is a council member.
[41:00.300 --> 41:01.300]  You'll have to turn that down.
[41:02.300 --> 41:03.300]  The meetings are real formal
[41:04.300 --> 41:05.300]  and it's so procedural
[41:06.300 --> 41:07.300]  and there's police officers
[41:08.300 --> 41:10.300]  and the heads of the city or the town or whatever there.
[41:11.300 --> 41:12.300]  So it seems real formal.
[41:12.300 --> 41:13.300]  And kind of terrifying.
[41:14.300 --> 41:16.300]  But once you've gone a few times,
[41:17.300 --> 41:19.300]  you see that it's just bored politicians
[41:20.300 --> 41:22.300]  who desperately want someone else to give a shit.
[41:23.300 --> 41:24.300]  And they're super happy
[41:25.300 --> 41:26.300]  to have anyone come down to the meetings
[41:27.300 --> 41:28.300]  and be interested the whole time.
[41:29.300 --> 41:30.300]  The only people that are there are paid to be there
[41:31.300 --> 41:32.300]  or people that are asking for something.
[41:33.300 --> 41:34.300]  When you start showing up,
[41:35.300 --> 41:37.300]  is the guy saying, I've done my homework.
[41:38.300 --> 41:39.300]  I figured out what I'm doing.
[41:40.300 --> 41:41.300]  I'm going to do this.
[41:42.300 --> 41:43.300]  I figured out that marijuana legalization
[41:44.300 --> 41:47.300]  could save our county $100,000
[41:48.300 --> 41:50.300]  and make our county $200,000 on top of that.
[41:51.300 --> 41:52.300]  So it's $300,000 total.
[41:53.300 --> 41:54.300]  They freak the fuck out.
[41:55.300 --> 41:56.300]  Everybody else goes, here's my issue.
[41:57.300 --> 41:58.300]  I need $10,000. Here's my issue.
[41:59.300 --> 42:00.300]  I need $35,000.
[42:01.300 --> 42:02.300]  Or even $50.
[42:03.300 --> 42:04.300]  The youth center needs another $3,000.
[42:05.300 --> 42:06.300]  The parking thing needs this much.
[42:07.300 --> 42:08.300]  When you show up and say,
[42:09.300 --> 42:10.300]  I found a way for you to make
[42:10.300 --> 42:11.300]  a huge amount of money
[42:12.300 --> 42:14.300]  or a way to bring a whole bunch of jobs to our area.
[42:15.300 --> 42:16.300]  When you tell your argument well,
[42:17.300 --> 42:19.300]  you can really hit these people
[42:20.300 --> 42:21.300]  in ways that they're going to go home thinking about.
[42:22.300 --> 42:23.300]  Mike has given you guys 12 good points to make.
[42:24.300 --> 42:25.300]  The tax money that it's bringing in,
[42:26.300 --> 42:27.300]  the jobs that it's going to make.
[42:28.300 --> 42:30.300]  Mike has already gotten you guys a bunch of head starts.
[42:31.300 --> 42:33.300]  I mean, 10 years ago when I was studying this stuff in college,
[42:34.300 --> 42:35.300]  it was all theoretical.
[42:36.300 --> 42:38.300]  We could guess what legalization might do to an area.
[42:38.300 --> 42:39.300]  We could look at Amsterdam
[42:40.300 --> 42:42.300]  and kind of guesstimate what that would look like in Denver.
[42:43.300 --> 42:45.300]  But it's been 15 years
[42:46.300 --> 42:47.300]  since our medical marijuana laws passed.
[42:48.300 --> 42:50.300]  2008 was the dispensary explosion
[42:51.300 --> 42:52.300]  with the medical marijuana heyday
[42:53.300 --> 42:54.300]  that we always talk about on the show.
[42:55.300 --> 42:56.300]  That was 2008.
[42:57.300 --> 42:58.300]  That was seven years ago.
[42:59.300 --> 43:01.300]  And so the data that's been collected
[43:02.300 --> 43:03.300]  over all that time,
[43:04.300 --> 43:06.300]  the cops were sure this was going to lead to the apocalypse.
[43:06.300 --> 43:07.300]  The rehab industry was sure
[43:08.300 --> 43:09.300]  this was going to lead to the apocalypse.
[43:10.300 --> 43:11.300]  The government was sure.
[43:12.300 --> 43:13.300]  And so everybody was keeping records.
[43:14.300 --> 43:15.300]  The Department of Revenue in Colorado,
[43:16.300 --> 43:17.300]  you can go on their website
[43:18.300 --> 43:20.300]  and pull the tax numbers by county, man.
[43:21.300 --> 43:22.300]  You can see what the 1% kickback
[43:23.300 --> 43:25.300]  that the generating area gets from the state adds up to
[43:26.300 --> 43:28.300]  for every little town that allows it.
[43:29.300 --> 43:30.300]  And so you can pull those numbers
[43:31.300 --> 43:32.300]  wherever you are on the planet now
[43:33.300 --> 43:35.300]  and say our little town has 40,000 people
[43:36.300 --> 43:38.300]  I've done the math and we can make this much
[43:39.300 --> 43:40.300]  or save this much.
[43:41.300 --> 43:42.300]  Make this much, definitely.
[43:43.300 --> 43:44.300]  It'll cost you a little, but over a year's time
[43:45.300 --> 43:46.300]  you're going to, we've seen what we did.
[43:47.300 --> 43:48.300]  We made $17 million here.
[43:49.300 --> 43:50.300]  You're not experimenting anymore.
[43:51.300 --> 43:52.300]  You're just looking at the reality
[43:53.300 --> 43:55.300]  and choosing the course that makes the most sense.
[43:56.300 --> 43:57.300]  All right, dude, we've gone just over 45 minutes.
[43:58.300 --> 43:59.300]  I'll let you go.
[44:00.300 --> 44:01.300]  You've got to be done in 14 minutes at the most.
[44:02.300 --> 44:03.300]  I'm pretty much done, man.
[44:04.300 --> 44:05.300]  If you guys have questions about getting involved
[44:06.300 --> 44:10.300]  or need help finding something research wise,
[44:11.300 --> 44:12.300]  feel free to tweet me or feel free to shoot the podcast
[44:13.300 --> 44:14.300]  and email and we'll get those answered on the show.
[44:15.300 --> 44:16.300]  Yeah, we'd love to.
[44:17.300 --> 44:18.300]  We love the interaction.
[44:19.300 --> 44:20.300]  If we skip something, if there's something else
[44:21.300 --> 44:22.300]  that you need more details on, get it Mike, get it myself.
[44:23.300 --> 44:24.300]  Get at the show.
[44:25.300 --> 44:26.300]  We'll answer it for you.
[44:27.300 --> 44:28.300]  Basically, go ahead, bro.
[44:29.300 --> 44:30.300]  You got something else to go for it.
[44:31.300 --> 44:32.300]  Do it.
[44:33.300 --> 44:34.300]  Just start Googling.
[44:34.300 --> 44:35.300]  We'll definitely help you.
[44:36.300 --> 44:37.300]  All human information is on the Internet.
[44:38.300 --> 44:39.300]  Now you just have to ask Google correctly
[44:40.300 --> 44:41.300]  and it will bring it to you.
[44:42.300 --> 44:43.300]  Mike gave out a bunch of groups that we should support.
[44:44.300 --> 44:45.300]  Those groups I'll repeat them.
[44:46.300 --> 44:47.300]  They were normal.
[44:48.300 --> 44:49.300]  It's NORML, the National Organization
[44:50.300 --> 44:51.300]  for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
[44:52.300 --> 44:53.300]  The MPP, the medical, remind me what the marijuana.
[44:54.300 --> 44:55.300]  Marijuana Policy Project.
[44:56.300 --> 44:57.300]  Policy Project.
[44:58.300 --> 44:59.300]  Yeah, yeah, I saw it coming.
[45:00.300 --> 45:01.300]  LEAP, that's Law Enforcement Against Prohibition.
[45:02.300 --> 45:03.300]  Make sure you check those guys out.
[45:04.300 --> 45:05.300]  Keep yourself out of trouble.
[45:06.300 --> 45:07.300]  And FlexYourRights.com, is that it?
[45:08.300 --> 45:09.300]  FlexYourRights.com.
[45:10.300 --> 45:11.300]  Yep, FlexYourRights.com, I believe.
[45:12.300 --> 45:13.300]  If you just Google Flex Your Rights, it'll come right up.
[45:14.300 --> 45:15.300]  Yeah, check out that because then you can learn
[45:16.300 --> 45:17.300]  how to protect yourself in an interaction
[45:18.300 --> 45:19.300]  with law enforcement.
[45:20.300 --> 45:21.300]  In an upcoming video, we're going to watch,
[45:22.300 --> 45:23.300]  or an upcoming episode, we're going to watch
[45:24.300 --> 45:25.300]  a video of some cops smoking cannabis
[45:26.300 --> 45:27.300]  for the first time.
[45:28.300 --> 45:29.300]  They're retired police officers.
[45:30.300 --> 45:31.300]  I haven't seen the video yet, but we're definitely
[45:32.300 --> 45:33.300]  going to watch that here on the show.
[45:34.300 --> 45:35.300]  I think Clint is going to be on a future episode.
[45:36.300 --> 45:37.300]  Nice, I love it when Clint's on the show.
[45:38.300 --> 45:39.300]  Him and I went to see, him and I and a few
[45:40.300 --> 45:41.300]  other friends actually went to see Doug Benson
[45:42.300 --> 45:44.300]  on 420, and Doug recorded a comedy album
[45:45.300 --> 45:46.300]  on 420, and the album is now out.
[45:47.300 --> 45:48.300]  And Clint and I both downloaded it,
[45:49.300 --> 45:50.300]  and we have listened to it, and we're going
[45:51.300 --> 45:52.300]  to review the album here on the show.
[45:53.300 --> 45:54.300]  Nice.
[45:55.300 --> 45:56.300]  And then we're going to get Clint's stupid high.
[45:57.300 --> 45:58.300]  That's what I think is going to happen on that episode.
[45:59.300 --> 46:00.300]  I want to be here for his first dab.
[46:01.300 --> 46:02.300]  I don't think Clint will ever take a dab.
[46:02.300 --> 46:03.300]  I think he's going to be a little bit afraid.
[46:04.300 --> 46:05.300]  Everybody is at first.
[46:06.300 --> 46:07.300]  All right, you guys, we're going to start
[46:08.300 --> 46:09.300]  wrapping up the show.
[46:10.300 --> 46:11.300]  Before I get too far, I want to give a big
[46:12.300 --> 46:13.300]  shout out to my homie D's.
[46:14.300 --> 46:15.300]  The other day I played a really dancey
[46:16.300 --> 46:17.300]  electronic song at the end of the podcast,
[46:18.300 --> 46:19.300]  and that was from my buddy D's.
[46:20.300 --> 46:21.300]  We're going to play that one again here
[46:22.300 --> 46:23.300]  at the end of the episode.
[46:24.300 --> 46:25.300]  I'm going to make a note to do that.
[46:26.300 --> 46:27.300]  Also, huge, huge shout out to Sunny,
[46:28.300 --> 46:29.300]  Rive, and Arnie.
[46:30.300 --> 46:31.300]  My friend Sunny threw a party Saturday night.
[46:32.300 --> 46:33.300]  We've never met before, and we put a band
[46:34.300 --> 46:35.300]  together that night, and we played a bunch
[46:36.300 --> 46:37.300]  of songs for a few hours, and we killed it.
[46:38.300 --> 46:39.300]  It was a lot of fun.
[46:40.300 --> 46:41.300]  Shout out to Sunny for the invite.
[46:42.300 --> 46:43.300]  Shout out to Rive and Arnie for joining me.
[46:44.300 --> 46:45.300]  It was great fun.
[46:46.300 --> 46:47.300]  I look forward to doing that again
[46:48.300 --> 46:49.300]  in the very near future.
[46:50.300 --> 46:51.300]  Big shout out to the Spot Dispensary.
[46:52.300 --> 46:53.300]  Shout out to the Grammy Gatsby.
[46:54.300 --> 46:55.300]  Mike, big old shout out for coming on the
[46:56.300 --> 46:57.300]  show and teaching people how to get involved.
[46:58.300 --> 46:59.300]  That's what we've needed for a little bit here.
[47:00.300 --> 47:01.300]  Thanks, bro.
[47:02.300 --> 47:03.300]  I'm Mike.
[47:04.300 --> 47:05.300]  I'm 15.
[47:06.300 --> 47:07.300]  We can direct message about whatever.
[47:08.300 --> 47:09.300]  I can help you get involved.
[47:10.300 --> 47:11.300]  I've spent 10 years passionately researching
[47:12.300 --> 47:13.300]  cannabis, the history, the medical effects,
[47:14.300 --> 47:15.300]  all of that, so I'm happy to point you in
[47:16.300 --> 47:17.300]  whatever direction you're looking to get
[47:18.300 --> 47:19.300]  informed on, guys.
[47:20.300 --> 47:21.300]  Just hit me up.
[47:22.300 --> 47:23.300]  Hit up the show.
[47:24.300 --> 47:25.300]  He knows a lot of shit, too.
[47:26.300 --> 47:27.300]  It's not a real narrow scope.
[47:28.300 --> 47:29.300]  He knows a broad scope.
[47:30.300 --> 47:31.300]  If it's any at all weed or social policy
[47:32.300 --> 47:33.300]  issues, I'll be there.
[47:34.300 --> 47:35.300]  Thanks for helping us, dude.
[47:36.300 --> 47:37.300]  Thanks for listening to another episode.
[47:38.300 --> 47:39.300]  I'll be back Monday with I think it's
[47:40.300 --> 47:41.300]  going to be episode 78 Monday.
[47:42.300 --> 47:43.300]  I love it.
[47:44.300 --> 47:45.300]  Dude, can't wait for a hundred, man.
[47:46.300 --> 47:47.300]  I have no big promises for 100.
[47:48.300 --> 47:49.300]  I've been trying to focus about two
[47:50.300 --> 47:51.300]  episodes ahead right now.
[47:52.300 --> 47:53.300]  Just keep some tight.
[47:54.300 --> 47:55.300]  If you guys have ideas for episode 100,
[47:56.300 --> 47:57.300]  let me know.
[47:58.300 --> 47:59.300]  We'll see what we can do.
[48:00.300 --> 48:01.300]  Now that the show is over,
[48:02.300 --> 48:03.540]  All you have to do is send me an email.
[48:03.540 --> 48:05.180]  It's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[48:05.180 --> 48:07.060]  I'll get you all the information you need.
[48:07.060 --> 48:09.220]  Mike and I would love to review your products on the show.
[48:09.220 --> 48:11.580]  We'd like to play with all the toys you guys send me.
[48:11.580 --> 48:12.700]  We'll let you know.
[48:12.700 --> 48:15.380]  So now that the show is over, please go to iTunes.
[48:15.380 --> 48:16.920]  Just like our buddy did at the start of the show,
[48:16.920 --> 48:19.120]  leave a comment, give me a five-star rating.
[48:20.260 --> 48:21.940]  You know, what that does is it helps us
[48:21.940 --> 48:23.620]  move up into the ranks in iTunes.
[48:23.620 --> 48:24.720]  More people see the show,
[48:24.720 --> 48:25.940]  more people will listen to the show,
[48:25.940 --> 48:28.380]  more people will grow good cannabis.
[48:28.380 --> 48:29.380]  It just goes in a cycle.
[48:29.380 --> 48:30.220]  So.
[48:30.220 --> 48:31.260]  The more people listening,
[48:31.260 --> 48:32.900]  the better the herb's gonna be everywhere.
[48:32.900 --> 48:34.220]  Everywhere, you guys.
[48:34.220 --> 48:36.340]  Don't forget that the show is available on iTunes, Stitcher,
[48:36.340 --> 48:38.820]  and every single episode is always and forever archived
[48:38.820 --> 48:41.380]  on iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[48:41.380 --> 48:43.100]  You guys, we did add a donation button
[48:43.100 --> 48:44.860]  to the podcast page a while back.
[48:44.860 --> 48:46.260]  Not trying to beg, but all you gotta do
[48:46.260 --> 48:49.020]  is go to the iRegenetics Colorado website,
[48:49.020 --> 48:50.740]  click on the Grow From Your Heart podcast tab.
[48:50.740 --> 48:52.340]  At the top right, there's that donation button.
[48:52.340 --> 48:53.740]  It's a little PayPal logo.
[48:53.740 --> 48:54.560]  Click on that.
[48:54.560 --> 48:56.360]  It does go directly to my PayPal account.
[48:56.360 --> 48:58.020]  I'm never gonna charge you for this podcast.
[48:58.020 --> 49:00.180]  I promise it's always going to be free,
[49:00.180 --> 49:02.180]  but if you wanna make a contribution for my time
[49:02.180 --> 49:05.300]  and my energy, it would definitely be appreciated.
[49:05.300 --> 49:07.020]  We're on all the social media sites.
[49:07.020 --> 49:09.000]  On Twitter, it's at GFYH Podcast.
[49:09.000 --> 49:10.940]  On Facebook, it's Grow From Your Heart.
[49:11.900 --> 49:15.140]  On Instagram, you're gonna wanna follow at iRegenetics.

[49:20.500 --> 49:22.580]  Until next time, take a fat dad
[49:22.580 --> 49:24.180]  and give your mama a hug for me.
