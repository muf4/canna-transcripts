[00:00.000 --> 00:01.920]  Hey, what's up, podcast world?
[00:01.920 --> 00:06.520]  It is time for episode 449 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.520 --> 00:09.640]  This episode of the show is brought to you by Seeds Here Now.
[00:09.640 --> 00:14.660]  If you need new regular, feminized, or autoflower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Seeds
[00:14.660 --> 00:21.040]  Here Now, and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:21.040 --> 00:25.320]  It has become a tradition that we start this podcast off by talking about what I'm dabbing.
[00:25.320 --> 00:30.200]  Today I've been taking big, giant dabs of Tahoe Jam Fambrosia from our friends at Apothecary
[00:30.200 --> 00:31.200]  Farms.
[00:31.200 --> 00:39.240]  The potency label says that this product contains 72.9% THC and 84.4% total cannabinoids.
[00:39.240 --> 00:43.740]  I really like the flavor and aroma of the Tahoe Jam Fambrosia.
[00:43.740 --> 00:47.000]  This is a blend of Tahoe OG and Jam Band.
[00:47.000 --> 00:49.800]  I'm cracking it open right now to get a smell.
[00:49.800 --> 00:51.340]  It is gassy.
[00:51.340 --> 00:52.880]  It is skunky.
[00:52.880 --> 00:54.480]  It is gross, and it is delicious.
[00:54.640 --> 00:57.040]  And this diamond that is left in this container is beautiful.
[00:57.040 --> 00:59.120]  I've got one big, fat diamond.
[00:59.120 --> 01:00.960]  I got a nice little layer of Terp Sauce here.
[01:00.960 --> 01:03.320]  This is going to make one delicious dab.
[01:03.320 --> 01:05.680]  That's going to be my after podcast reward.
[01:05.680 --> 01:10.660]  So big shout out to my friends at Apothecary Farms for the delicious Tahoe Jam Fambrosia.
[01:10.660 --> 01:15.000]  Make sure you check out Apothecary Farms in Denver, Colorado Springs, and of course, the
[01:15.000 --> 01:16.000]  Pueblo location.
[01:16.000 --> 01:17.960]  All right, podcast world.
[01:17.960 --> 01:21.320]  In this episode, I'm going to talk a little bit about outdoor growing.
[01:21.320 --> 01:25.520]  Before we get there, I want to do some shout outs to our friends from Patreon.
[01:25.520 --> 01:28.020]  Let's start off with a big thank you shout out to Miss Mel.
[01:28.020 --> 01:30.360]  I want to give a giant shout out to my buddy Stabby.
[01:30.360 --> 01:33.960]  I want to send a giant Viking handshake to my buddy Grimboldedruid.
[01:33.960 --> 01:38.880]  And as always, a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to my buddy Aldridge.
[01:38.880 --> 01:42.600]  Big thanks to each and every one of you for all of the continued Patreon support.

[01:51.120 --> 01:54.120]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:54.120 --> 01:55.880]  All right, podcast world.
[01:55.880 --> 01:59.360]  At the start of the show, I said I was going to talk a little bit about outdoor growing,
[01:59.360 --> 02:01.500]  so let's jump right into that.
[02:01.500 --> 02:04.440]  Before I get too deep into this, let me make a disclaimer.
[02:04.440 --> 02:07.720]  I am not a very experienced outdoor grower.
[02:07.720 --> 02:11.160]  I have never been fully in charge of an outdoor grow.
[02:11.160 --> 02:12.720]  I have worked in an outdoor grow.
[02:12.720 --> 02:14.560]  I've worked with outdoor growers.
[02:14.560 --> 02:17.100]  I've been involved in greenhouse situations.
[02:17.100 --> 02:21.020]  But I am not the most experienced outdoor grower.
[02:21.020 --> 02:27.300]  90% of my grow experience and history and resume are all from indoor growing.
[02:27.300 --> 02:30.500]  I am very familiar with indoor cultivation.
[02:30.500 --> 02:36.220]  I have had a few emails requesting information on outdoor growing, so I am going to do my
[02:36.220 --> 02:41.300]  best to provide quality, accurate information.
[02:41.300 --> 02:46.280]  Since it is just about time for our outdoor plants to begin flowering, I thought the first
[02:46.460 --> 02:51.960]  question I should address is, when will my outdoor plants begin to flower and why are
[02:51.960 --> 02:58.480]  my outdoor plants flowering before we have gotten a 12-12 light cycle outdoors?
[02:58.480 --> 03:02.840]  We are right at the end of July, approaching the very first week of August, so our plants
[03:02.840 --> 03:05.380]  will begin to flower any time now.
[03:05.380 --> 03:10.840]  It is strain-specific, it is cultivar-specific, and it is very location-specific, but it is
[03:10.840 --> 03:15.380]  just about time for our outdoor cannabis plants to start flowering.
[03:15.480 --> 03:20.660]  Let's do a quick talk about when to expect our outdoor cannabis plants to begin the flowering
[03:20.660 --> 03:21.660]  phase.
[03:21.660 --> 03:25.580]  Now, since we are talking about outdoors, we need to keep in mind that seasons are different
[03:25.580 --> 03:30.740]  around the planet, so this will be based on the North American season.
[03:30.740 --> 03:33.840]  This will also be more specifically based on the mountain time zone.
[03:33.840 --> 03:34.840]  I am in Colorado.
[03:34.840 --> 03:37.660]  I am most familiar with the mountain time zone.
[03:37.660 --> 03:39.580]  I know what happens here weather-wise.
[03:39.580 --> 03:41.460]  This is what I can speak most about.
[03:41.460 --> 03:42.860]  This is what I've got to work with.
[03:42.860 --> 03:47.420]  That's where most of my information will be pulled from, is the North American mountain
[03:47.420 --> 03:48.420]  time zone.
[03:48.420 --> 03:53.780]  If you're following along in another area, you may need to adjust your calendar dramatically.
[03:53.780 --> 03:57.060]  This will apply to the North American mountain time zone.
[03:57.060 --> 03:58.940]  You can adjust from where you are.
[03:58.940 --> 04:01.540]  If you are in North America, most of this will be accurate.
[04:01.540 --> 04:06.280]  Just depends on how far east, west, north, and south you are, but let's get into it.
[04:06.280 --> 04:10.460]  Our outdoor season should begin right around the first of August.
[04:10.460 --> 04:13.360]  This is very plant dependent.
[04:13.360 --> 04:17.260]  This is very strain dependent, also very phenotype dependent.
[04:17.260 --> 04:21.220]  This will also depend on your specific location.
[04:21.220 --> 04:26.180]  To get even more specific, your actual altitude could have a huge difference with how soon
[04:26.180 --> 04:31.340]  your plants begin to flower and also how soon your plants finish.
[04:31.340 --> 04:35.460]  Another thing that will contribute to when your plants begin to flower is how much shade
[04:35.460 --> 04:36.460]  are you getting?
[04:36.460 --> 04:40.100]  Are you in a shady area or are you in a really sunny area?
[04:40.100 --> 04:44.060]  Are your plants getting the maximum amount of sun they can handle or are they wishing
[04:44.060 --> 04:45.540]  there was more?
[04:45.540 --> 04:49.820]  Are you in a shaded area and are your plants achieving their DLI?
[04:49.820 --> 04:53.460]  If your plants are not receiving their DLI, they may begin to flower because they think
[04:53.460 --> 04:57.940]  that the light has reduced and the season for flowering has begun.
[04:57.940 --> 05:04.780]  The main thing that will decide when your plants go into flower is that specific cultivar's
[05:04.780 --> 05:06.340]  critical period.
[05:06.340 --> 05:12.140]  The critical period is what we call the amount of darkness that plant requires for it to
[05:12.140 --> 05:14.940]  induce its flowering phase.
[05:14.940 --> 05:19.180]  A plant's critical period will be different indoors and outdoors.
[05:19.180 --> 05:24.460]  We're going to talk about that in just a moment, but the critical period of your plant has
[05:24.460 --> 05:28.100]  a lot to do with when that plant decides to flower.
[05:28.100 --> 05:32.860]  We have learned that most plants we have bred like a 12-12 light cycle indoors to induce
[05:32.860 --> 05:34.060]  flowering.
[05:34.060 --> 05:38.580]  By experimenting, we have also found plants that will flower with 14 hours of darkness
[05:38.580 --> 05:40.620]  or 11 hours of darkness.
[05:40.620 --> 05:44.700]  It takes a little bit of experimenting, but we have learned that some plants have different
[05:44.700 --> 05:46.260]  critical periods.
[05:46.260 --> 05:50.560]  This just depends mainly on where the genetics of that plant came from.
[05:50.560 --> 05:55.980]  This could be strain-specific and it could also be very cultivar-specific.
[05:55.980 --> 06:00.060]  Just because you've got two different phenotypes of the same strain, one may want to flower
[06:00.060 --> 06:02.700]  earlier, one may want to flower later.
[06:02.700 --> 06:06.700]  That is just going to be the phenotypical expression and that is going to be the critical
[06:06.700 --> 06:09.100]  period of each cultivar.
[06:09.100 --> 06:12.940]  We need to figure out the critical period of each plant we run.
[06:12.940 --> 06:15.900]  Again, that is going to be all based on genetics.
[06:15.900 --> 06:18.840]  Most of that is based on where those genetics came from.
[06:18.840 --> 06:21.820]  What part of the planet did that genetic originate?
[06:21.820 --> 06:23.100]  What did we breed it to?
[06:23.100 --> 06:24.160]  What is dominant?
[06:24.160 --> 06:28.340]  What is going to show that will make our critical period?
[06:28.340 --> 06:32.680]  A couple of other things that will have an effect on when our plant will flower is which
[06:32.680 --> 06:34.820]  side of the mountain are you on?
[06:34.820 --> 06:36.460]  I know that may sound crazy.
[06:36.460 --> 06:39.340]  When we live in Colorado, we think about that sort of thing.
[06:39.340 --> 06:44.140]  We may have way lots of sunshine on one side of the mountain and hardly any sunshine on
[06:44.140 --> 06:45.960]  the other side of the mountain.
[06:45.960 --> 06:49.600]  Some of those will flower sooner, some of those will flower later.
[06:49.600 --> 06:53.080]  Some farmers use that as a way to set up a perpetual crop.
[06:53.080 --> 06:56.900]  They know that this side of the mountain flowers earlier, this side of the mountain flowers
[06:56.900 --> 06:57.900]  later.
[06:57.900 --> 06:58.900]  You plant everything at the same time.
[06:58.900 --> 07:02.780]  You let nature run its magic and you get a three-week separated perpetual harvest.
[07:02.780 --> 07:04.260]  It is beautiful.
[07:04.260 --> 07:06.940]  Another thing that will make an effect is the altitude.
[07:06.940 --> 07:09.080]  How high up on the mountain are you?
[07:09.080 --> 07:10.240]  Are you down in the valley?
[07:10.240 --> 07:12.700]  If you're down in the valley, you may not get as much light.
[07:12.700 --> 07:14.780]  Your plants may flower more early.
[07:14.780 --> 07:18.420]  If you're up at the top of the mountain, you're probably getting more potential light, so
[07:18.420 --> 07:21.760]  you're going to flower later because you're not getting that light reduction.
[07:21.760 --> 07:23.500]  Your plants are getting all that sunshine.
[07:23.500 --> 07:25.480]  They say, hey, we're just going to keep vegging.
[07:25.480 --> 07:26.620]  It's not dark time yet.
[07:26.660 --> 07:27.660]  We'll keep it going.
[07:27.660 --> 07:31.860]  The biggest determining factor of when your plants are going to begin their flowering
[07:31.860 --> 07:35.100]  phase in your outdoor grow is mainly genetics.
[07:35.100 --> 07:36.660]  Where did those plants originate?
[07:36.660 --> 07:38.200]  Where did those genetics originate?
[07:38.200 --> 07:39.500]  Think about the cross.
[07:39.500 --> 07:40.500]  Think about each parent.
[07:40.500 --> 07:42.180]  Think about each grandparent.
[07:42.180 --> 07:46.940]  Things like that will reveal ideas about when it may begin to flower and also how long it
[07:46.940 --> 07:48.620]  may take to flower.
[07:48.620 --> 07:52.160]  Other than genetics, the next thing to think about are environment.
[07:52.160 --> 07:53.540]  Of course, sun.
[07:53.540 --> 07:55.180]  How much sun are you getting?
[07:55.180 --> 07:56.180]  Altitude.
[07:56.240 --> 07:57.660]  Are there other stressors?
[07:57.660 --> 07:59.100]  Have you had any severe weather?
[07:59.100 --> 08:02.900]  Have you done anything weird to the plants to cause them any sort of stress?
[08:02.900 --> 08:08.660]  All of these things will have small factors as to when your plants begin to go into flower.
[08:08.660 --> 08:13.860]  Like I said earlier, the flowering season in my area here in Colorado, in North America,
[08:13.860 --> 08:19.060]  in the mountain time zone, most of our plants will begin to flower right around now through
[08:19.060 --> 08:21.760]  the first of August, through the second week of August.
[08:21.760 --> 08:24.540]  We should start seeing our plants kicking into flower.
[08:24.540 --> 08:27.600]  Here is a really helpful tip if you are a new outdoor grower.
[08:27.600 --> 08:32.180]  You are going to see the male plants begin to flower first.
[08:32.180 --> 08:38.300]  It is very common that those boy plants take off about a week to 10 days before the females.
[08:38.300 --> 08:42.100]  So you should be able to walk through that field every day and when you start seeing
[08:42.100 --> 08:47.020]  the male plants making their little balls, you know that those females are about 7 to
[08:47.020 --> 08:52.260]  10, maybe 14 days at the most behind to start flowering.
[08:52.260 --> 08:58.460]  Now while I'm on that rant, make sure you are watching and culling males.
[08:58.460 --> 09:04.500]  If you see a male plant appear in your outdoor garden and your intention is not to make seeds,
[09:04.500 --> 09:13.280]  you need to remove all of the males from your outdoor garden as early as possible.
[09:13.280 --> 09:19.860]  If you allow one male plant to get away from you and drop pollen, you will pollinate every
[09:19.860 --> 09:24.860]  plant within a certain radius of that plant depending on the size of the plant and how
[09:24.860 --> 09:27.220]  much pollen was released.
[09:27.220 --> 09:31.700]  Now it's okay to make a mistake and mess up your own crop.
[09:31.700 --> 09:37.880]  The dickhead thing to do is to make a mistake and pollinate the entire neighborhood's crop.
[09:37.880 --> 09:44.660]  We are in a legal cannabis world where many people are growing cannabis outdoors for medical
[09:44.660 --> 09:49.780]  reasons, for personal use, and also for commercial production.
[09:49.780 --> 09:54.860]  Don't be the person who forgets to pull a male plant from their garden and pollinates
[09:54.860 --> 10:00.960]  the entire neighborhood and ruins people's outdoor garden for the entire year.
[10:00.960 --> 10:07.580]  Many people are putting a lot of hours and a lot of work into a successful outdoor garden,
[10:07.580 --> 10:10.700]  just as many hours as you, if not more.
[10:10.700 --> 10:16.900]  So respect their garden just as much, if not more, than you respect yours.
[10:16.900 --> 10:23.740]  So be sure to find every male plant in your outdoor garden and remove it before it gets
[10:23.740 --> 10:28.420]  the opportunity to release pollen on your crop and the neighbors.
[10:28.420 --> 10:33.180]  Now a really good way to make sure that you are not running any males outdoors is to run
[10:33.180 --> 10:34.180]  clones.
[10:34.180 --> 10:38.820]  Have familiar clones, but I understand that's not always an option, but make sure your male
[10:38.820 --> 10:41.100]  plants do not get away from you.
[10:41.100 --> 10:43.580]  All right, let me get my stoned ass back on track here.
[10:43.580 --> 10:48.980]  My point is, when you see those male plants beginning to flower, the female plants of
[10:48.980 --> 10:54.500]  the same strain and similar phenotypes should be about seven to 10 days behind, probably
[10:54.500 --> 11:00.220]  no more than 14 days behind, and they will start flipping to their flower phase.
[11:00.220 --> 11:05.140]  Now let's talk about why some of our plants are beginning to flower when we have got more
[11:05.140 --> 11:07.940]  than 14 hours of daylight outside.
[11:07.940 --> 11:12.440]  We are very familiar with our plants flowering on a 12-12 cycle indoors, so why don't they
[11:12.520 --> 11:14.320]  do that outdoors?
[11:14.320 --> 11:20.040]  There's a very good reason and a very good explanation for that phenomenon.
[11:20.040 --> 11:26.200]  What is happening is outdoors, as the sun sets, it begins to put off a red spectrum
[11:26.200 --> 11:28.360]  that is known as far red.
[11:28.360 --> 11:33.520]  That triggers a hormone in your plant known as phytochrome red.
[11:33.520 --> 11:37.440]  Phytochrome red basically tells the plant, hey, it's nappy nap time.
[11:37.440 --> 11:39.120]  So that plant starts going, hey, you know what?
[11:39.120 --> 11:40.200]  We should probably take a nap.
[11:40.200 --> 11:41.200]  It's dark time.
[11:41.240 --> 11:45.320]  Instead of just getting that sudden click and the lights go off and it's dark, there's
[11:45.320 --> 11:47.000]  a little trigger from the sun.
[11:47.000 --> 11:49.360]  Nature says, hey guys, nighttime is coming.
[11:49.360 --> 11:52.760]  It's basically mom going, hey guys, you got to quit playing that video game in 10 minutes.
[11:52.760 --> 11:54.680]  You got to brush your teeth and you got to go to bed.
[11:54.680 --> 11:57.480]  Mom comes in and flicks the lights and everybody goes, ah, we got to brush our teeth and go
[11:57.480 --> 11:58.480]  to bed.
[11:58.480 --> 11:59.720]  So that's what the sun does.
[11:59.720 --> 12:02.240]  Phytochrome red, far red, they work together.
[12:02.240 --> 12:04.600]  The plant says, hey guys, it's time to go to sleep.
[12:04.600 --> 12:09.840]  The plant begins to go to sleep and you will see the leaves in the plant start to droop.
[12:09.840 --> 12:11.280]  There's nothing wrong with the plant.
[12:11.280 --> 12:12.280]  It's going to sleep.
[12:12.280 --> 12:13.280]  It's taking a nap.
[12:13.280 --> 12:14.560]  It's shutting down for the night.
[12:14.560 --> 12:16.960]  That way it can begin the flowering process.
[12:16.960 --> 12:21.400]  That way it can start spitting out big fat flowers and do the magic that we want done.
[12:21.400 --> 12:25.920]  So that is the simplest way for me to explain why our plants are flowering when we've got
[12:25.920 --> 12:28.080]  14 hours of daylight still.
[12:28.080 --> 12:32.800]  They are being triggered by far red light, which triggers phytochrome red inside of the
[12:32.800 --> 12:37.040]  plant, which tells that plant, hey, it is nappy nap time.
[12:37.040 --> 12:40.400]  Now I mentioned earlier that sometimes we may see the leaves of our plants begin to
[12:40.400 --> 12:42.280]  droop at the end of the day.
[12:42.280 --> 12:44.840]  You may also see this in your veg phase.
[12:44.840 --> 12:47.640]  You may see this anytime in your growth.
[12:47.640 --> 12:51.320]  If the leaves are drooping and it is a regular thing, if it's happening after a certain time
[12:51.320 --> 12:56.400]  period every day, let's say you've got the lights on for 18 hours and around 16 hours
[12:56.400 --> 12:58.260]  you start seeing some light droop.
[12:58.260 --> 13:02.480]  That means that that plant has taken as much light as it can get for the day.
[13:02.480 --> 13:05.800]  It has met its DLI, its daily light integral.
[13:05.800 --> 13:06.800]  It can't take any more.
[13:07.560 --> 13:08.880]  It's got all the light vitamins it needs.
[13:08.880 --> 13:11.200]  Its light meter is filled up and it's like, hey, I'm done.
[13:11.200 --> 13:12.440]  I'm just going to shut down.
[13:12.440 --> 13:14.120]  I'm not going to take any more light.
[13:14.120 --> 13:16.400]  And it starts putting itself to sleep for the day.
[13:16.400 --> 13:21.320]  So sometimes if you consistently see light or plants beginning to droop at a specific
[13:21.320 --> 13:25.760]  time in the light cycle, they may be getting their daily light integral.
[13:25.760 --> 13:27.240]  You may be wasting electricity.
[13:27.240 --> 13:29.960]  You may be pumping too much light into that plant.
[13:29.960 --> 13:32.200]  There are a couple of ways you can solve that.
[13:32.200 --> 13:36.120]  The most obvious thing you could do is reduce the amount of daylight hours.
[13:36.440 --> 13:38.320]  You could turn the lights off an hour earlier.
[13:38.320 --> 13:40.200]  That way that plant can just go to sleep.
[13:40.200 --> 13:43.920]  You're not wasting that electricity on the light and the HVAC that comes along with the
[13:43.920 --> 13:45.400]  light running.
[13:45.400 --> 13:49.320]  Another thing you could do is simply move that plant further from your light source.
[13:49.320 --> 13:50.760]  I don't know what type of lights you're using.
[13:50.760 --> 13:55.960]  I don't know the situation, but if it is possible, remove that plant from the light source, put
[13:55.960 --> 13:59.800]  some distance on it so it's not getting all those photons, all those U moles.
[13:59.800 --> 14:01.240]  That'll cool that plant down.
[14:01.240 --> 14:03.180]  That'll make it stop working so hard.
[14:03.180 --> 14:07.020]  If you are in an outdoor situation and you were seeing this, the thing you may need is
[14:07.020 --> 14:10.860]  a shade cloth, or you may need to simply drag those plants to the shade.
[14:10.860 --> 14:12.780]  That may be your only option.
[14:12.780 --> 14:15.940]  If you see a little leaf droop and it's not a plant problem, if you're sure they're not
[14:15.940 --> 14:20.500]  overwatered, if you're sure they're not underwatered, it is quite possibly that those plants have
[14:20.500 --> 14:24.700]  met their daily light integral and they're just taking a break.
[14:24.700 --> 14:27.660]  Let me recap real quick and see if there's anything I left out, see what else I want
[14:27.660 --> 14:28.660]  to talk about.
[14:28.660 --> 14:32.840]  We have talked about that it's mainly genetics that will decide when our plants flower outdoors.
[14:33.500 --> 14:35.640]  We have talked about environmental factors.
[14:35.640 --> 14:36.720]  We talked about altitude.
[14:36.720 --> 14:39.280]  The higher you are, the later you may go into flower.
[14:39.280 --> 14:42.200]  The more shade you've got, the earlier you will go into flower.
[14:42.200 --> 14:45.420]  We've also talked about the critical period of our plants.
[14:45.420 --> 14:51.480]  Then we have also talked about phytochrome red and far red and 14 hours of daylight.
[14:51.480 --> 14:54.120]  Now let's talk about the finishing time.
[14:54.120 --> 14:59.600]  Most of our plants are going to be done, in my experience, between the first week of October
[14:59.600 --> 15:00.860]  and Halloween.
[15:00.900 --> 15:05.060]  Some of the later flowering things won't finish until as late as Halloween.
[15:05.060 --> 15:08.840]  Some plants would like to go later than Halloween, but by then it is getting really cold.
[15:08.840 --> 15:12.780]  We have probably gotten our first snow and our first frost here in Colorado.
[15:12.780 --> 15:18.660]  We usually aim for phenotypes and plants that will finish by Halloween at the absolute latest.
[15:18.660 --> 15:21.980]  Most people are usually done by the middle of October.
[15:21.980 --> 15:23.100]  You should be done.
[15:23.100 --> 15:24.940]  You've got all of August to flower.
[15:24.940 --> 15:26.940]  You've got all of September to flower.
[15:26.940 --> 15:31.340]  Right around the start of October through the end of October should be harvest season.
[15:31.340 --> 15:35.060]  Now if you're running a greenhouse with supplemental lighting or if you've got some sort of light
[15:35.060 --> 15:38.340]  depth, your situation may be completely different.
[15:38.340 --> 15:44.700]  Like I said, this is very location dependent, very plant, very phenotype and very cultivar
[15:44.700 --> 15:45.700]  specific.
[15:45.700 --> 15:48.900]  In most cases, we should start flowering any time now.
[15:48.900 --> 15:51.740]  The first week of August should be our flowering time.
[15:51.740 --> 15:54.300]  We should start seeing our boys and girls any time now.
[15:54.300 --> 15:57.420]  Hopefully those males have already started showing you that they're boys.
[15:57.420 --> 16:00.220]  You've got to go through and pull every male out of the garden.
[16:00.220 --> 16:01.300]  Don't be lazy.
[16:01.300 --> 16:05.860]  If you are the supervisor or the boss and your crew says, we pulled all the males, it
[16:05.860 --> 16:07.780]  is still your job to go look.
[16:07.780 --> 16:11.380]  If you've got a golf cart, if you got to do it by horseback, if you got to get out there
[16:11.380 --> 16:16.780]  on your feet with your boots, go make sure that all of the males have been pulled from
[16:16.780 --> 16:17.780]  the garden.
[16:17.780 --> 16:19.540]  That is a huge responsibility.
[16:19.540 --> 16:21.220]  I can't stress that enough.
[16:21.220 --> 16:22.460]  Don't ruin your grow.
[16:22.460 --> 16:23.960]  Don't ruin your neighbor's grow.
[16:24.120 --> 16:25.120]  It will cause problems.
[16:25.120 --> 16:27.440]  That is something you need to be thinking about now.
[16:27.440 --> 16:29.640]  Get the males out of the grow.
[16:29.640 --> 16:33.240]  Once you've got those males out of the grow, it is time to focus on those females and it
[16:33.240 --> 16:35.680]  is flowering season.
[16:35.680 --> 16:39.200]  Then depending on the plants you're working with, you should have a nice harvest around
[16:39.200 --> 16:41.960]  October time or on the start or the end of October.
[16:41.960 --> 16:45.960]  You should be cutting down some beautiful outdoor cannabis plants.
[16:45.960 --> 16:50.960]  All right, Podcast World, that is my super quick breakdown on when to expect our outdoor
[16:50.960 --> 16:53.080]  cannabis plants to begin flowering.
[16:53.200 --> 16:54.440]  I hope you learned something.
[16:54.440 --> 16:58.680]  Again, keep in mind that I'm not the most experienced outdoor grower, but I'm doing
[16:58.680 --> 17:00.560]  my best to help my friends.
[17:00.560 --> 17:02.640]  All right, I'm going to shift gears.
[17:02.640 --> 17:04.680]  I've got a pile of emails here.
[17:04.680 --> 17:07.140]  Let's read some listener emails.
[17:07.140 --> 17:10.120]  If anybody out there would like to send me an email or a grow question, or if you've
[17:10.120 --> 17:14.920]  got something you'd like to say, my email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[17:14.920 --> 17:16.720]  You know that I would love to hear from you.
[17:16.720 --> 17:19.000]  This email goes just like this.
[17:19.000 --> 17:21.240]  Hey, Ross DeGeff, it's Two Wheels here.
[17:21.240 --> 17:25.240]  I've been listening to your show for a while now, but this is my first time writing in.
[17:25.240 --> 17:29.320]  I just want to let you know I appreciate you for all of the helpful tips and knowledge
[17:29.320 --> 17:31.440]  you're spreading to better this earth.
[17:31.440 --> 17:33.520]  Man, that is a great way to start an email.
[17:33.520 --> 17:34.760]  Thank you for the great compliment.
[17:34.760 --> 17:36.040]  Thank you for listening.
[17:36.040 --> 17:37.540]  Thank you for writing the email.
[17:37.540 --> 17:42.080]  It goes on to say, but now that it's spring, I've done my research and I'm ready to start
[17:42.080 --> 17:44.280]  my four plant outdoor grow.
[17:44.280 --> 17:49.880]  The only problem is I'm not sure what's going to pop up since I've got random seeds from
[17:49.880 --> 17:50.880]  a friend.
[17:51.520 --> 17:54.760]  I know this guy is ready to grow his outdoor garden, but he got some random seeds from
[17:54.760 --> 17:57.200]  a friend he has no idea what to expect.
[17:57.200 --> 17:58.200]  That could be problematic.
[17:58.200 --> 17:59.200]  That could be a struggle.
[17:59.200 --> 18:03.720]  It goes on to say, I have about 12 seeds, but only room for four plants.
[18:03.720 --> 18:08.680]  What do you think the best option is for sprout time and any early signs of better keepers
[18:08.680 --> 18:13.240]  if the majority of them are female?
[18:13.240 --> 18:14.240]  Anything helps.
[18:14.240 --> 18:17.560]  Sincerely, Two Wheels, you can say my name if you want on the air.
[18:17.560 --> 18:20.520]  I'm glad you said that because I had unsaid your name a couple of times.
[18:21.160 --> 18:22.520]  Big shout out to our buddy, Two Wheels.
[18:22.520 --> 18:24.080]  Let's talk about this a little bit here.
[18:24.080 --> 18:28.380]  He got some seeds from his friend and he can't decide how to decide what to keep.
[18:28.380 --> 18:31.880]  My advice, and this sounds like I'm trying to sell you something because I am a seed
[18:31.880 --> 18:36.480]  breeder, but honestly, my advice would be to ditch those 12 seeds and buy yourself a
[18:36.480 --> 18:39.840]  reliable pack of feminized seeds.
[18:39.840 --> 18:44.800]  I would definitely suggest some iRegenetic seeds, but if that's not for you, find some
[18:44.800 --> 18:50.280]  feminized seeds that do work for you, something that gets your attention, some kind of a strain
[18:50.320 --> 18:54.320]  description, a flavor profile, or something that makes you go, ooh and ah, and I would
[18:54.320 --> 18:55.760]  get those seeds.
[18:55.760 --> 18:59.680]  I know that that may take you time and money and those may not be available, but that is
[18:59.680 --> 19:02.320]  honestly what I would do.
[19:02.320 --> 19:06.160]  You have got 12 seeds, they were given to you, you want to grow them.
[19:06.160 --> 19:08.780]  These seeds could be who knows where they came from.
[19:08.780 --> 19:13.280]  They could be all hermaphrodites, they could be hemp seeds, they could all be problems.
[19:13.280 --> 19:15.240]  You have no idea what you're working with.
[19:15.240 --> 19:19.160]  They could all be 12 different seeds from different strains.
[19:19.160 --> 19:24.200]  You may have one pure indica, you may have one pure haze, you may have a plant that's
[19:24.200 --> 19:28.540]  going to flower in eight weeks and a plant that is going to flower in 17 weeks.
[19:28.540 --> 19:30.240]  You have no idea what is in there.
[19:30.240 --> 19:33.480]  You could have all males, you could have all hermaphrodites.
[19:33.480 --> 19:38.280]  You've got a big gamble and you're going to put time and energy and money into this project.
[19:38.280 --> 19:43.760]  I would do it properly and I would buy seeds that you knew what to expect to set yourself
[19:43.760 --> 19:45.320]  up for success.
[19:45.320 --> 19:48.940]  Setting yourself up for success is a huge step that many people fail at when it comes
[19:48.940 --> 19:50.000]  to growing.
[19:50.000 --> 19:54.460]  We get excited, we get overzealous, we get eager, we want to get some seeds in the ground
[19:54.460 --> 19:55.900]  and get growing.
[19:55.900 --> 19:58.920]  But we made a huge mistake by getting the wrong seeds.
[19:58.920 --> 20:02.180]  So I know you've got these seeds in your hand and you really want to grow them.
[20:02.180 --> 20:06.420]  I would suggest you pass those back to your friend and say, hey dude, thanks for the gesture.
[20:06.420 --> 20:10.100]  Rasta Jeff suggested I grow some reliable seeds.
[20:10.100 --> 20:11.500]  That's what I would do.
[20:11.500 --> 20:16.100]  Now if you do insist on growing these seeds, let's talk more about some of the questions
[20:16.100 --> 20:18.180]  which you have asked.
[20:18.180 --> 20:20.840]  You've got 12 seeds, only room for four plants.
[20:20.840 --> 20:26.220]  If you've got room for four plants and these seeds were free, I would say plant all 12
[20:26.220 --> 20:30.660]  and then cull eight of them because you're going to have 50% males, which means probably
[20:30.660 --> 20:33.520]  six to seven are going to go.
[20:33.520 --> 20:37.180]  We don't know if these seeds are any good, so who knows how many of them will sprout.
[20:37.180 --> 20:40.020]  I would just sprout all 12 and see what you get.
[20:40.020 --> 20:41.060]  Then I would veg them out.
[20:41.060 --> 20:42.980]  If they're going outdoors, they're going to veg on their own.
[20:42.980 --> 20:44.740]  They'll flower on their own.
[20:44.740 --> 20:46.160]  Then pay attention to them.
[20:46.160 --> 20:49.080]  If you see a hermaphrodite or a boy, it's got to go.
[20:49.080 --> 20:50.140]  Then start watching.
[20:50.140 --> 20:51.460]  Watch for robust growth.
[20:51.460 --> 20:53.060]  Watch for traits you like.
[20:53.060 --> 20:57.520]  As it gets bigger, start doing some stem rubs at the main part of the stem, the biggest
[20:57.520 --> 20:58.520]  part.
[20:58.520 --> 21:01.320]  Just grab your fingers and rub it and then give it a smell and see what it smells like.
[21:01.320 --> 21:03.960]  Some will get your attention, some will not.
[21:03.960 --> 21:05.760]  You've just got to use what gets your attention.
[21:05.760 --> 21:07.200]  That's all you've got now.
[21:07.200 --> 21:09.940]  Ideally, we would run these plants indoors one time.
[21:09.940 --> 21:13.080]  We would find a pheno that we like and we would cull the rest and we would have a clone
[21:13.080 --> 21:14.240]  of the keepers.
[21:14.320 --> 21:17.840]  Unfortunately, outdoors doesn't give us that option.
[21:17.840 --> 21:20.960]  The only way to figure out what you've got is to just run it.
[21:20.960 --> 21:22.680]  I would sprout all 12 seeds.
[21:22.680 --> 21:24.200]  I would let them begin to flower.
[21:24.200 --> 21:26.520]  As soon as I see the males, I would pull the males.
[21:26.520 --> 21:30.960]  I wouldn't worry about which plants I like until you get rid of the boys because you
[21:30.960 --> 21:34.800]  will get attached to a plant and it will be a male and you'll want to be stubborn.
[21:34.800 --> 21:35.800]  You'll say, that's not a boy.
[21:35.800 --> 21:36.800]  That's not a boy.
[21:36.800 --> 21:37.800]  It's a boy.
[21:37.800 --> 21:38.800]  Get rid of it.
[21:38.800 --> 21:39.800]  It's got to go.
[21:39.800 --> 21:40.800]  Just call it.
[21:40.800 --> 21:42.200]  Don't get attached to any of them until they are in flower.
[21:42.200 --> 21:46.160]  Once you know you've got girls, that's when you can fall in love with a couple of them.
[21:46.160 --> 21:48.080]  You may have four left at that point.
[21:48.080 --> 21:52.760]  Honestly, if you plant 12, maybe two don't germinate, you're down to 10.
[21:52.760 --> 21:55.400]  And then you've got 50-50 chance of boys and girls.
[21:55.400 --> 21:57.220]  That's going to give you five boys, five girls.
[21:57.220 --> 21:59.880]  If you sway one way, you're down to four right now.
[21:59.880 --> 22:02.400]  The numbers game may just work out in your favor.
[22:02.400 --> 22:06.240]  I would just plant all of them and then eliminate as needed.
[22:06.240 --> 22:08.880]  Now what can we look for for the keepers?
[22:08.880 --> 22:11.420]  That kind of depends on what you want in your finished product.
[22:11.640 --> 22:13.060]  Do you want more of a head racy thing?
[22:13.060 --> 22:15.340]  Do you want more of a body high sort of a thing?
[22:15.340 --> 22:18.860]  Obviously you can look for leaf size and shape.
[22:18.860 --> 22:22.180]  The plants with the bigger, fatter leaves are going to produce a medicine that is probably
[22:22.180 --> 22:24.260]  more endicodominant, more sedative.
[22:24.260 --> 22:25.760]  It's going to make you want to chill out.
[22:25.760 --> 22:27.420]  It's going to make you more relaxed.
[22:27.420 --> 22:31.540]  The plants with the longer, skinnier leaves are probably going to produce a medicine that
[22:31.540 --> 22:33.180]  is more sativa dominant.
[22:33.180 --> 22:36.660]  You'll get more of a head buzz, more of a psychedelic sort of a feeling.
[22:36.660 --> 22:41.380]  So that is a good way to start deciding which plants are going to work best for you.
[22:41.380 --> 22:42.660]  What are your needs?
[22:42.660 --> 22:43.660]  Do you need that indica?
[22:43.660 --> 22:45.380]  Do you need that sativa?
[22:45.380 --> 22:49.620]  If you know that you don't like a really strong sativa, maybe immediately that's a way to
[22:49.620 --> 22:50.920]  cull a couple of plants.
[22:50.920 --> 22:54.300]  Just get rid of those sativa dominant phenotypes.
[22:54.300 --> 22:57.060]  Another thing to look at is just overall health of the plant.
[22:57.060 --> 22:58.740]  Is one growing nice and stout?
[22:58.740 --> 22:59.980]  Is one growing really robust?
[22:59.980 --> 23:01.500]  Or is one struggling?
[23:01.500 --> 23:03.780]  If one's struggling, get rid of it.
[23:03.780 --> 23:06.160]  Now at this point, you're definitely down to four plants.
[23:06.160 --> 23:08.020]  That shouldn't make it too hard to decide.
[23:08.020 --> 23:11.660]  The trick is to not get attached to these plants until they're flowering, until you've
[23:11.660 --> 23:14.260]  got a way to see what they are going to give you.
[23:14.260 --> 23:16.940]  Don't fall in love too soon before you get to know it.
[23:16.940 --> 23:20.980]  Then it's just going to be harder to minimize when the time does come.
[23:20.980 --> 23:23.500]  It sounds like you're going to have a fun experience no matter what happens.
[23:23.500 --> 23:27.700]  I hope at least one of those seeds is a real gem so you've got some quality medicine for
[23:27.700 --> 23:28.860]  the rest of the year.
[23:28.860 --> 23:31.260]  Either way, you should have some quality product.
[23:31.260 --> 23:34.460]  Even if those aren't the greatest seeds, you will produce some flowers.
[23:34.460 --> 23:36.340]  It'll be a great learning experience.
[23:36.660 --> 23:40.220]  Again, I really recommend just ditching these gift seeds.
[23:40.220 --> 23:43.900]  I know that sounds rude as hell, but they were a gift and they could be problematic.
[23:43.900 --> 23:48.140]  I would suggest you spend a few bucks and get yourself some quality, reliable, feminized
[23:48.140 --> 23:51.140]  seeds and then work with those in your outdoor grow.
[23:51.140 --> 23:54.340]  You will save yourself a lot of headaches and a lot of wonders.
[23:54.340 --> 23:56.700]  Again, set yourself up for success.
[23:56.700 --> 24:00.140]  You're going to hear me say that a lot on this podcast in the coming episodes.
[24:00.140 --> 24:03.860]  It is something I learned a very long time ago and it feels like it's something that
[24:03.860 --> 24:06.280]  I need to remind myself and other people.
[24:06.720 --> 24:10.840]  Set yourself up for success in all aspects.
[24:10.840 --> 24:14.320]  With all of the distractions and interruptions, life can get challenging.
[24:14.320 --> 24:16.080]  Growing can be challenging.
[24:16.080 --> 24:20.840]  We don't need to add other obstacles to our lives and to our grows to make things harder.
[24:20.840 --> 24:23.920]  Do your best to set yourself up for success.
[24:23.920 --> 24:28.400]  Remove the obstacles, get the bullshit out of the way, make a clear path and head that
[24:28.400 --> 24:30.360]  way and succeed.
[24:30.360 --> 24:31.640]  Set yourself up for success.
[24:31.640 --> 24:33.720]  Nobody else is going to do it for you.
[24:33.720 --> 24:36.440]  Everybody else is worried about their own success.
[24:36.440 --> 24:38.400]  You've got to set yourself up to succeed.
[24:38.400 --> 24:41.920]  All right, Podcast World, I want to thank Two Wheels for the great email here.
[24:41.920 --> 24:42.920]  I hope I helped you out.
[24:42.920 --> 24:46.920]  I know I told you just to ditch those seeds and buy new ones, but that is honestly my
[24:46.920 --> 24:47.920]  best advice.
[24:47.920 --> 24:51.840]  All right, Podcast World, I'm going to wrap up this episode of the Grow From Your Heart
