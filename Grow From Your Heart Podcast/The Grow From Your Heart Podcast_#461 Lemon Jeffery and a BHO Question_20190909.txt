[00:00.000 --> 00:01.280]  All right, here we go.
[00:01.280 --> 00:05.180]  Welcome to episode 461 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:05.180 --> 00:08.720]  This episode of the show is brought to you by my friends at Seeds Here Now.
[00:08.720 --> 00:13.280]  If you need new regular, feminized, or auto flower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend
[00:13.280 --> 00:20.960]  Seeds Here Now, and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:20.960 --> 00:24.200]  You know I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:24.200 --> 00:29.280]  Today I've been taking dabs of Infinity OG Live Batter from our friends at Green Dot
[00:29.280 --> 00:30.280]  Labs.
[00:30.280 --> 00:33.680]  This is a blend of Underdog OG and I-95.
[00:33.680 --> 00:37.320]  The package describes the flavor as gas, earth, and bitter skunk.
[00:37.320 --> 00:40.200]  I'm cracking the container open now to give it a fresh smell.
[00:40.200 --> 00:46.840]  Immediately, I get that gassy, earthy aroma, followed by a disgustingly, magically delicious,
[00:46.840 --> 00:49.200]  skunky aroma that I just cannot resist.
[00:49.200 --> 00:51.120]  I can't stop smelling this right now.
[00:51.120 --> 00:53.840]  I could sit here and smell this jar for the entire episode.
[00:54.480 --> 00:55.640]  Let's close this back up, flip it over.
[00:55.640 --> 01:03.080]  On the back of the package, it says that this product contains 67.26% THC and zero total
[01:03.080 --> 01:04.080]  CBD.
[01:04.080 --> 01:09.280]  Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious and amazing Infinity
[01:09.280 --> 01:10.480]  OG Live Batter.
[01:10.480 --> 01:13.480]  I'm obviously loving the effects of this concentrate.
[01:13.480 --> 01:18.040]  All right, podcast world, in this episode, I'm going to read some listener emails.
[01:18.040 --> 01:23.800]  Before we get there, let's do some shout outs to our faithful friends from Patreon.
[01:23.800 --> 01:27.080]  Let's start off with a big, giant, Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and a thank you
[01:27.080 --> 01:28.160]  to my friend Tommy.
[01:28.160 --> 01:31.880]  I want to send a giant, Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to Jacob W. How about a
[01:31.880 --> 01:36.640]  giant thank you to my friend Keith K. Of course, as always, a giant, Grow From Your Heart podcast
[01:36.640 --> 01:40.840]  shout out, a handshake, and a personal thank you to my good friend Stabby McStabwood.
[01:40.840 --> 01:44.320]  I also want to send a giant thank you and a Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to
[01:44.320 --> 01:49.280]  our friend Todd K. Of course, we cannot ever miss our buddy OG Purple Thumb.
[01:49.280 --> 01:51.040]  Big shout out and big thank you for the support.
[01:51.280 --> 01:54.840]  Also, I want to send a giant personal thank you and a shout out to my buddy Aldridge.
[01:54.840 --> 01:55.840]  Big thanks, bro.
[01:55.840 --> 02:01.000]  And last, but certainly not least, I want to send a big, giant, Viking handshake, a
[02:01.000 --> 02:05.480]  big Rasta fist bump, and a Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you to my buddy Grimball
[02:05.480 --> 02:06.600]  the Druid.
[02:06.600 --> 02:11.920]  Big thanks, much respect, big love to everybody who has continued to support the show on Patreon.
[02:11.920 --> 02:18.680]  If you would like to learn how to support the show, you can do so by going to www.patreon.com
[02:19.680 --> 02:24.080]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[02:24.080 --> 02:27.880]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, smokers and growers, I did say that
[02:27.880 --> 02:30.480]  we were going to read some emails on this episode.
[02:30.480 --> 02:33.540]  Let's jump right into the email portion of the podcast.
[02:33.540 --> 02:37.960]  If anybody out there has a cannabis cultivation or a cannabis culture question, or if you've
[02:37.960 --> 02:40.780]  got something you'd like to tell me, maybe you've got a correction you'd like to make
[02:40.780 --> 02:43.760]  about something I've said in the past, I would love to hear from you.
[02:43.760 --> 02:47.920]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[02:47.920 --> 02:49.760]  Don't be shy, send me an email.
[02:49.760 --> 02:53.760]  Also let me know if you want me to say your name or not in that email.
[02:53.760 --> 02:56.280]  A lot of people look forward to hearing their name on the show.
[02:56.280 --> 03:00.080]  A lot of people really do not want their name said on the show.
[03:00.080 --> 03:03.560]  So when you send me an email, simply put, Hey Rasta Jeff, my name is Bill.
[03:03.560 --> 03:06.560]  I would love it if you say my name on the show, or if you start off with, Hey Rasta
[03:06.560 --> 03:07.920]  Jeff, my name is Bill.
[03:07.920 --> 03:09.680]  Please do not say my name on the show.
[03:09.680 --> 03:13.800]  I will do my best to carefully keep you anonymous and not say your name.
[03:13.800 --> 03:15.480]  Some people really want to hear their name.
[03:15.480 --> 03:19.360]  So I apologize if I did not say your name when I have read your email.
[03:19.360 --> 03:23.320]  All right, let's get into the first email of this episode.
[03:23.320 --> 03:25.320]  This one goes a lot like this.
[03:25.320 --> 03:30.320]  Hey Rasta Jeff, you're not just growing killer plants to help medicate the masses in Colorado,
[03:30.320 --> 03:35.680]  but you're also growing the knowledge and ability of people worldwide to grow medicine
[03:35.680 --> 03:37.840]  to the best of their abilities.
[03:37.840 --> 03:38.840]  That is awesome.
[03:38.840 --> 03:42.620]  This guy notices that I'm traveling up and down I-25 here in Colorado, teaching all those
[03:42.620 --> 03:44.420]  commercial facilities how to grow.
[03:44.420 --> 03:45.420]  I'm growing for the masses.
[03:45.420 --> 03:48.300]  And at the same time, I am spreading free knowledge.
[03:48.300 --> 03:49.340]  Yes, that is my goal.
[03:49.340 --> 03:50.340]  That is my mission.
[03:50.340 --> 03:51.340]  That is kind of my purpose.
[03:51.340 --> 03:53.900]  Of course, I'm a father first, all that stuff matters more.
[03:53.900 --> 03:59.060]  But then after that, I'm supposed to be teaching the world how to grow the best quality cannabis
[03:59.060 --> 04:00.060]  they can produce.
[04:00.060 --> 04:01.740]  So that is one of my life purposes.
[04:01.740 --> 04:02.900]  So I'm glad that you see it.
[04:02.900 --> 04:04.400]  Thanks for acknowledging that.
[04:04.400 --> 04:09.020]  It goes on to say, and for that, sir, no single email can thank you enough.
[04:09.020 --> 04:10.580]  That's all right, because I get a lot of emails.
[04:10.580 --> 04:12.940]  I get multiple emails every day thanking me.
[04:12.940 --> 04:13.940]  So thank you.
[04:13.940 --> 04:15.060]  Keep those messages coming.
[04:15.060 --> 04:16.340]  They're like fuel for the fire.
[04:16.340 --> 04:17.740]  They just keep me going.
[04:17.740 --> 04:22.820]  Not only do I get to see gardens thriving, I get to see patients and recreational smokers
[04:22.820 --> 04:24.340]  happy and satisfied.
[04:24.340 --> 04:29.260]  I get to see business owners happy and satisfied because I was able to increase overall productivity
[04:29.260 --> 04:30.540]  of their facility.
[04:30.540 --> 04:34.380]  But then I get messages like this every day from people saying, dude, you helped me grow.
[04:34.380 --> 04:35.860]  You made my garden better.
[04:35.860 --> 04:36.940]  All of that stuff adds up.
[04:36.940 --> 04:38.140]  I get to see it every day.
[04:38.140 --> 04:39.140]  So thank you.
[04:39.140 --> 04:40.560]  Please keep fueling my fire.
[04:40.560 --> 04:41.840]  Keep my passion fresh.
[04:41.840 --> 04:42.840]  I appreciate that.
[04:42.840 --> 04:46.320]  We're going to keep moving on this email because I'm obviously fucking rambly today.
[04:46.320 --> 04:50.640]  It says, I've emailed you in the past and your advice has saved my backside from issues
[04:50.640 --> 04:54.000]  that would have inevitably ruined many grows.
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.360]  I'm glad I was able to help you out in the past.
[04:56.360 --> 04:59.800]  Hopefully I can continue to provide quality information.
[04:59.800 --> 05:04.040]  It goes on to say, I just finished up my first run of Lemon Jeffrey and my lady and I have
[05:04.040 --> 05:05.600]  fallen in love with it.
[05:05.600 --> 05:09.840]  Well, I'm glad you chose a iRegenetic strain to grow, especially the Lemon Jeffrey that
[05:09.840 --> 05:11.160]  is named after me.
[05:11.160 --> 05:13.720]  So I'm glad that your lady and yourself enjoyed that.
[05:13.720 --> 05:18.960]  He says, I have three stepkids who have fallen prey to Prohibitionland's anti-cannabis rhetoric.
[05:18.960 --> 05:23.800]  So my current setup is a three foot wide by three and a half foot tall by one and a half
[05:23.800 --> 05:29.920]  foot deep cabinet outfitted with LED lights, which is perfect for us, but does not produce
[05:29.920 --> 05:32.600]  huge yields due to the size constraints.
[05:32.600 --> 05:36.500]  Yes, that is a fairly limited space you've got there, but you should be able to produce
[05:36.500 --> 05:37.500]  some quality medicine.
[05:37.500 --> 05:40.860]  It sounds like you grew some Lemon Jeffrey that's got you and your lady happy.
[05:40.860 --> 05:43.380]  Let's continue, see what else we've got to work with.
[05:43.380 --> 05:47.780]  I was able to top and trellis my Lemon Jeffrey to fill out most of the net and keep it small
[05:47.780 --> 05:48.780]  enough.
[05:48.780 --> 05:53.540]  Sadly, we had to pull her a little bit early because of timing issues with the kids, but
[05:53.540 --> 05:58.060]  I was so surprised from the quality and yield, even with an early harvest.
[05:58.060 --> 05:59.660]  Hey, that is awesome to hear.
[05:59.660 --> 06:01.420]  Had to cut it down early.
[06:01.420 --> 06:02.420]  Sometimes shit happens.
[06:02.420 --> 06:03.820]  I'm not going to speculate on what happens.
[06:03.820 --> 06:05.300]  You say it was problems with the kids.
[06:05.300 --> 06:06.540]  Who knows what went on there?
[06:06.580 --> 06:11.260]  I hope everything is cool now, but even though you had an interruption, we had to end the
[06:11.260 --> 06:16.260]  grow a little bit early, you were still more than satisfied with the yield and the quality
[06:16.260 --> 06:17.260]  of the product.
[06:17.260 --> 06:18.260]  So that means a lot to me.
[06:18.260 --> 06:20.180]  I'm really glad you had a successful grow.
[06:20.180 --> 06:21.180]  It keeps going.
[06:21.180 --> 06:27.800]  It says, high energy and clear headed high with tasty ass lemon heads and newly opened
[06:27.800 --> 06:30.180]  tennis ball flavors aplenty.
[06:30.180 --> 06:31.180]  That's really interesting.
[06:31.180 --> 06:36.140]  I quite often describe the Lemon Jeffrey as smelling like if you got a box of lemon heads
[06:36.140 --> 06:41.780]  and dumped the candy out of the box and smelled the inside of the box, it has that soft candied
[06:41.780 --> 06:43.420]  lemon flavor.
[06:43.420 --> 06:47.080]  I also quite often describe it as country time lemonade powder.
[06:47.080 --> 06:50.060]  It smells very much like lemonade powder.
[06:50.060 --> 06:56.680]  I have not heard anybody describe the Lemon Jeffrey as the fresh tennis ball aroma before.
[06:56.680 --> 06:57.680]  That is very unique.
[06:57.680 --> 06:59.160]  That is very interesting.
[06:59.160 --> 07:03.380]  You cut it down early, so maybe that is something that happens earlier in the process.
[07:03.380 --> 07:06.620]  Maybe that tennis ball smell goes away by the time I'm cutting it down.
[07:06.620 --> 07:07.880]  I have never had that.
[07:07.880 --> 07:12.460]  I have had the tennis ball aroma in many other crosses and strains that I've grown, but I
[07:12.460 --> 07:14.500]  have never experienced that in the Lemon Jeffrey.
[07:14.500 --> 07:16.060]  So that's really interesting to me.
[07:16.060 --> 07:18.920]  I want to keep going with this email because it does keep going and there's a lot of great
[07:18.920 --> 07:20.340]  stuff to it.
[07:20.340 --> 07:21.340]  Tasty ass lemon heads.
[07:21.340 --> 07:22.340]  That is great.
[07:22.340 --> 07:23.340]  I'm going to continue though.
[07:23.340 --> 07:27.400]  It says, we hope that someday the stigma of the anti-cannabis folks will fizzle out so
[07:27.400 --> 07:33.060]  we can enjoy our passion for this plant without the worry of Johnny Law breaking down our
[07:33.740 --> 07:34.740]  door.
[07:34.740 --> 07:38.400]  Yes, that is the hope, the dream, and the goal of cannabis growers and consumers and
[07:38.400 --> 07:41.180]  activists nationwide, if not worldwide.
[07:41.180 --> 07:46.860]  We do want to be able to grow and possess and consume our medicine safely without the
[07:46.860 --> 07:52.300]  fear of Johnny Law kicking in the door, shooting the dog, destroying your shit, taking you
[07:52.300 --> 07:55.780]  to jail, disrupting your life, making you look like an asshole.
[07:55.780 --> 07:57.260]  Yes, that is what we all want.
[07:57.260 --> 07:58.860]  We want legalization.
[07:58.860 --> 08:04.060]  The message says, but until then, we will continue to grow from our hearts and keep
[08:04.060 --> 08:05.060]  Irie.
[08:05.060 --> 08:06.620]  Hey, I hope you continue to grow.
[08:06.620 --> 08:08.620]  I hope you continue to stay safe.
[08:08.620 --> 08:12.080]  If you were there in prohibition land, please keep yourself safe.
[08:12.080 --> 08:13.340]  Keep yourself protected.
[08:13.340 --> 08:15.340]  The first priority is those kids.
[08:15.340 --> 08:16.960]  So make sure those kids are safe.
[08:16.960 --> 08:21.500]  Make sure the kids have everything we need and then let's grow some killer cannabis.
[08:21.500 --> 08:22.500]  There is more to the message.
[08:22.500 --> 08:27.820]  It says, my mom got her hug, so it's your turn to smoke that fat dab and hug white Mike
[08:27.820 --> 08:28.820]  for me.
[08:28.820 --> 08:29.820]  I'm your dad, you're Mike.
[08:29.820 --> 08:30.820]  You hear that bro?
[08:30.820 --> 08:33.940]  When I take a dab and give you a random hug, it is because our friend here from this email
[08:33.940 --> 08:35.420]  requested that I give you a hug.
[08:35.420 --> 08:37.200]  So don't get weird on me, bro.
[08:37.200 --> 08:38.200]  So Mike will get a hug.
[08:38.200 --> 08:39.900]  I promise you I will take a fat dab.
[08:39.900 --> 08:42.540]  In fact, I just took a fat enough dab a minute ago.
[08:42.540 --> 08:44.260]  We're going to say that that one was for you.
[08:44.260 --> 08:45.260]  That shit counted.
[08:45.260 --> 08:46.260]  Trust me.
[08:46.260 --> 08:48.100]  Then he signs the email with his name.
[08:48.100 --> 08:52.620]  He just said Matty E. So big shout out to Matty E. If you guys out there wonder if this
[08:52.620 --> 08:56.180]  is Matty E and he is in prohibition land, you're thinking about fucking with him.
[08:56.180 --> 08:58.700]  It wasn't that Matty E. It's a different Matty E.
[08:58.780 --> 09:01.580]  This Matty E is a fictional character, so chill out.
[09:01.580 --> 09:02.580]  Don't be a snitch.
[09:02.580 --> 09:04.980]  He wraps up the message by saying, P.S.
[09:04.980 --> 09:08.620]  If you read this on the podcast, you can call me Matty E. So there we go.
[09:08.620 --> 09:10.540]  We've got some permission and confirmation.
[09:10.540 --> 09:15.500]  Big shout out to our buddy Matty E. Matty E says, and I love all of the white Mike podcasts.
[09:15.500 --> 09:18.580]  He is a chill dude who I would love to smoke with.
[09:18.580 --> 09:23.540]  Plus, his insight on pro-cannabis politics gives me a different conversation point that
[09:23.540 --> 09:25.060]  I hadn't thought about.
[09:25.060 --> 09:27.540]  My vote is for more white Mike.
[09:27.540 --> 09:28.540]  So there you go, Cracker Mike.
[09:29.380 --> 09:30.380]  You got more votes.
[09:30.380 --> 09:31.380]  Somebody's voting for you.
[09:31.380 --> 09:33.380]  That means it's time for you to come be on the show again, buddy.
[09:33.380 --> 09:34.780]  We haven't seen you for a little bit.
[09:34.780 --> 09:35.780]  Come join us.
[09:35.780 --> 09:37.940]  All right, Matty E. I want to thank you for the great email.
[09:37.940 --> 09:39.620]  Thanks for growing the lemon, Jeffrey.
[09:39.620 --> 09:41.860]  I would love to see some pictures of your next grow.
[09:41.860 --> 09:42.860]  What are you growing next time?
[09:42.860 --> 09:44.180]  What are you setting up?
[09:44.180 --> 09:45.300]  Let's see some pictures.
[09:45.300 --> 09:48.820]  Also, make sure you join me on Cannabuzz and post some photos over there.
[09:48.820 --> 09:52.500]  I understand that you were in prohibition land, so you do need to be careful.
[09:52.500 --> 09:56.220]  Either email me some photos of the next grow or post them up on Cannabuzz.
[09:56.220 --> 09:58.500]  All right, Matty E. Good luck to you.
[09:58.500 --> 10:00.060]  Your lady and the kids.
[10:00.060 --> 10:02.820]  I hope the next grow is completely successful.
[10:02.820 --> 10:04.500]  All right, Podcast World.
[10:04.500 --> 10:06.060]  I do have another email in front of me.
[10:06.060 --> 10:08.540]  Let's keep moving right through this giant pile.
[10:08.540 --> 10:10.140]  This one goes like this.
[10:10.140 --> 10:11.460]  What's happening, Rasta Jeff?
[10:11.460 --> 10:15.540]  You can use my name, KC Benny, if you decide to read this on the podcast.
[10:15.540 --> 10:16.740]  What up, KC Benny?
[10:16.740 --> 10:18.260]  Big shout out to my new friend.
[10:18.260 --> 10:22.700]  It says, I'm a faithful listener, and I met you at the Dude Grows Cup back in April.
[10:22.700 --> 10:23.700]  What's up, bro?
[10:23.700 --> 10:25.460]  I hope we had a good time at the Dude Grows Cup in April.
[10:25.460 --> 10:29.860]  It says, I've made some BHO, and I've ended up with clear shatter, snap and pull, and
[10:29.860 --> 10:31.340]  sugar wax.
[10:31.340 --> 10:33.460]  Let's talk about that for a quick second here.
[10:33.460 --> 10:38.940]  This guy, this person made some BHO, and they ended up with clear shatter, which is usually
[10:38.940 --> 10:40.500]  the goal.
[10:40.500 --> 10:42.460]  Shatter is basically when you've got to concentrate.
[10:42.460 --> 10:48.900]  It kind of looks like a thin layer of Jolly Rancher, kind of an amber color, maybe a light
[10:48.900 --> 10:52.260]  yellow color, maybe a golden Jolly Rancher sort of a thing.
[10:52.260 --> 10:53.760]  Usually a real nice thin layer.
[10:53.760 --> 10:57.660]  We call it shatter because when you try to get some off of the sheet, the little piece,
[10:57.660 --> 11:02.880]  it breaks like candy or like glass, kind of like breaks like a Jolly Rancher, it shatters.
[11:02.880 --> 11:03.940]  We call it shatter.
[11:03.940 --> 11:05.920]  That is why it gets the name shatter.
[11:05.920 --> 11:08.880]  Then the next one he listed is snap and pull.
[11:08.880 --> 11:11.740]  Snap and pull is a lot like shatter, but it is softer.
[11:11.740 --> 11:15.440]  If you take shatter and you heat it with your hands, if you just put a little piece of shatter,
[11:15.440 --> 11:19.160]  it would have to be in parchment paper because it will stick directly to your hands.
[11:19.160 --> 11:22.760]  Fold a piece of parchment paper, put some shatter in there, hold it between your hands.
[11:22.760 --> 11:26.720]  Your body heat will melt the shatter enough to where it comes to a consistency known as
[11:26.720 --> 11:28.200]  snap and pull.
[11:28.200 --> 11:31.080]  You can just snap and pull a quick little dab off of there.
[11:31.080 --> 11:35.080]  You got to set the dabber on it just enough to get the dabber into the concentrate and
[11:35.080 --> 11:37.020]  then just pull a little dab right off real quick.
[11:37.020 --> 11:38.660]  Just pull it off there real quick and it'll come.
[11:38.660 --> 11:40.080]  Just one dab will come off really quickly.
[11:40.080 --> 11:41.720]  We call it snap and pull.
[11:41.720 --> 11:45.360]  It's kind of a thicker, laffy taffy sort of a texture.
[11:45.360 --> 11:48.440]  It's like the shatter but melted down a little bit to be softer.
[11:48.440 --> 11:49.520]  It's a little more pliable.
[11:49.520 --> 11:52.920]  It's a little bit easier to work with depending on your situation.
[11:52.920 --> 11:54.460]  Some people prefer the shatter.
[11:54.460 --> 11:56.680]  Some people prefer the snap and pull.
[11:56.680 --> 12:00.200]  Then there is another consistency that this listener has spoken of.
[12:00.200 --> 12:02.640]  They said they made sugar wax.
[12:02.640 --> 12:04.960]  Now, that is just another consistency.
[12:04.960 --> 12:07.880]  It is the same product, just a different consistency.
[12:07.880 --> 12:10.920]  It comes out looking a little bit like a big chunk of earwax.
[12:10.920 --> 12:12.960]  And I know that sounds disgusting.
[12:12.960 --> 12:17.660]  It also looks like maybe just a little chunk of melted crayon or sometimes it can be battery
[12:17.800 --> 12:22.840]  and it can look like a thick piece of butter or possibly a piece of cheesecake batter or
[12:22.840 --> 12:28.840]  possibly even maybe in some cases, cake batter or cookie dough looking sort of texture and
[12:28.840 --> 12:30.860]  appearances and consistency.
[12:30.860 --> 12:35.860]  When he says sugar wax, I'm thinking it is probably sort of like a snap and peel but
[12:35.860 --> 12:39.620]  a little bit, I don't want to say the word mushy because that doesn't give a good opinion,
[12:39.620 --> 12:44.900]  but like sort of like a puddle of like waxy, maybe applesauce might be the consistency
[12:44.900 --> 12:45.900]  I'm trying to think of.
[12:45.900 --> 12:49.780]  Light applesauce would be a nice sugar wax consistency.
[12:49.780 --> 12:51.500]  That'd be a good description.
[12:51.500 --> 12:56.580]  So those are some of the things that this person has made by making BHO on their own.
[12:56.580 --> 12:58.700]  These are very similar products.
[12:58.700 --> 13:00.140]  Basically you make them all the same.
[13:00.140 --> 13:04.780]  I don't talk about making concentrates on my podcast because I am not a concentrate
[13:04.780 --> 13:05.780]  maker.
[13:05.780 --> 13:08.060]  I can't give the proper advice on how to do it.
[13:08.060 --> 13:13.260]  And most importantly, I don't know how to do it completely safely without putting you,
[13:13.260 --> 13:16.780]  your neighbors or your family or your house or your building at risk.
[13:16.780 --> 13:18.860]  So I'm not going to teach you how to make concentrates.
[13:18.860 --> 13:22.400]  This person has already done it, so I'm not going to put him in any risk.
[13:22.400 --> 13:23.400]  This way he's doing it.
[13:23.400 --> 13:24.620]  I can't tell him not to.
[13:24.620 --> 13:25.620]  He's already got a product.
[13:25.620 --> 13:27.620]  We could talk about the finished product.
[13:27.620 --> 13:32.260]  What he's done is with these three different products, these are mainly just what happens
[13:32.260 --> 13:36.500]  from very little manipulation of the product or the starting material.
[13:36.500 --> 13:37.540]  The shatter will come out.
[13:37.540 --> 13:41.940]  If you do not disturb, if you run the material and do not disturb the final outcome, that
[13:41.940 --> 13:47.220]  concentrate that's in the container, it most likely will come out as a shatter.
[13:47.220 --> 13:49.900]  Some strains will not shatter up.
[13:49.900 --> 13:53.860]  Some things will always come out kind of snap and pulley.
[13:53.860 --> 13:58.900]  Now you can take the shatter and heat it or before it solidifies and you can whip it.
[13:58.900 --> 14:03.340]  There are several different techniques to whipping and that will turn it into a batter
[14:03.340 --> 14:07.240]  or a sugar or a different consistency.
[14:07.240 --> 14:10.860]  Just depends on the starting product, how it is whipped.
[14:10.860 --> 14:13.700]  When I say starting product, there are a lot of contributing factors.
[14:13.700 --> 14:16.820]  How moist or dry is your starting product?
[14:16.820 --> 14:23.060]  Then we have many things like how large are the trichome heads of the starting product?
[14:23.060 --> 14:25.960]  How long are the stocks of the starting product?
[14:25.960 --> 14:28.120]  Many things like that will make a factor.
[14:28.120 --> 14:31.160]  Then everything else in that plant will make a factor.
[14:31.160 --> 14:32.780]  What is the percentage of terpenoids?
[14:32.780 --> 14:34.380]  What is the percentage of lipids?
[14:34.380 --> 14:36.940]  What is the percentage of esters and paleots?
[14:36.940 --> 14:40.620]  All of that stuff is going to make a difference on the quality of your concentrate.
[14:40.620 --> 14:47.180]  Another very large contributing factor is, was anything applied to the plant at any cycle
[14:47.180 --> 14:48.180]  of its life?
[14:48.180 --> 14:49.180]  Was there a pesticide?
[14:49.180 --> 14:50.340]  Was there an essential oil?
[14:50.340 --> 14:52.900]  Was there anything else sprayed onto this plant?
[14:52.900 --> 14:56.320]  All of that is going to come through in your concentrate.
[14:56.320 --> 15:00.260]  Every detail will have something to do with the result of your final product.
[15:00.260 --> 15:04.620]  Every detail in the grow and the handling and in the processing of the extraction will
[15:04.620 --> 15:10.980]  have something to do with the quality and the texture and consistency of the final product.
[15:10.980 --> 15:14.660]  This person has ended up with Shatter, which is pretty much standard.
[15:14.660 --> 15:17.980]  They've come up with Snap and Pool, which is really easy to do once you catch onto the
[15:17.980 --> 15:18.980]  Shatter.
[15:18.980 --> 15:20.180]  Then they have made Sugar Wax.
[15:20.180 --> 15:22.820]  Now let's keep going with their email and get to the actual question.
[15:22.820 --> 15:24.380]  Sorry I'm so rambly today.
[15:24.380 --> 15:26.700]  I hope you enjoy it for the podcast.
[15:26.700 --> 15:31.340]  It says, my question is, how do I know that I am purging enough?
[15:31.340 --> 15:35.980]  I have a vacuum chamber, which is a small stainless steel pot with a lucite lid and
[15:35.980 --> 15:36.980]  a gauge.
[15:36.980 --> 15:41.420]  I leave the product in there on a heating pad, set it high to about 110 degrees under
[15:41.420 --> 15:47.900]  a full vacuum, either until it turns to wax or there are absolutely no bubbles happening.
[15:47.900 --> 15:50.860]  Am I getting it right or am I giving myself cancer?
[15:50.860 --> 15:54.300]  The product is always tasty and usually blows my head off.
[15:54.300 --> 15:59.180]  Thank you for the podcast and the beans and all of the knowledge and entertainment.
[15:59.180 --> 16:01.380]  Sincerely, from Casey Benny.
[16:01.380 --> 16:04.540]  Hey, first off, you are very welcome for the podcast.
[16:04.540 --> 16:06.160]  You're very welcome for the beans.
[16:06.160 --> 16:09.380]  You're very welcome for the knowledge and also for the entertainment.
[16:09.380 --> 16:11.740]  Thank you for noticing and acknowledging that.
[16:11.740 --> 16:14.740]  Like I said before, that keeps my fire burning.
[16:14.740 --> 16:16.820]  So now let's talk a little bit about your question.
[16:16.820 --> 16:22.220]  You are concerned that the concentrates you are making at home, are they purged efficiently,
[16:22.220 --> 16:24.940]  sufficiently, properly, and enough?
[16:24.940 --> 16:25.940]  Are you giving yourself cancer?
[16:25.940 --> 16:28.880]  Are you smoking butane is what you want to know.
[16:28.880 --> 16:33.120]  Now keep in mind that I've already said a few times, I am not a concentrate maker.
[16:33.120 --> 16:35.080]  I've seen this done several times.
[16:35.080 --> 16:38.320]  I've watched Kevin do this for a brief point in time.
[16:38.320 --> 16:41.320]  Our buddy Spence was trying to teach me how to make concentrates.
[16:41.320 --> 16:42.520]  I did okay.
[16:42.520 --> 16:43.520]  It was not for me.
[16:43.520 --> 16:44.800]  I would rather be in the garden.
[16:44.800 --> 16:46.240]  I would rather be breeding seeds.
[16:46.240 --> 16:48.300]  I'd rather be recording podcasts.
[16:48.300 --> 16:52.200]  So I leave the concentrates up to my expert friends.
[16:52.200 --> 16:57.500]  Now that being said, let's talk a little bit about what I do know about purging a concentrate.
[16:57.500 --> 16:59.300]  It sounds like you have got the right idea.
[16:59.300 --> 17:02.700]  You are putting it on heat and you are putting it in a vacuum chamber.
[17:02.700 --> 17:06.420]  The heat is going to allow the concentrate to stay viscous.
[17:06.420 --> 17:09.400]  The vacuum is going to pull the air out of there.
[17:09.400 --> 17:14.580]  As the air comes out, supposedly it is sucking the residual butane out of that concentrate
[17:14.580 --> 17:16.240]  at the same time.
[17:16.240 --> 17:20.980]  If you were doing everything correctly and giving it enough time to properly purge, you
[17:20.980 --> 17:26.220]  should be removing most of the butane and enough of the butane that would make the product
[17:26.420 --> 17:27.420]  dangerous.
[17:27.420 --> 17:29.460]  I do have a couple of concerns.
[17:29.460 --> 17:32.260]  Are you flipping the slab at any point in time?
[17:32.260 --> 17:36.220]  While it's in that chamber vacuum purging, do you ever release the pressure, take the
[17:36.220 --> 17:40.560]  lid off, turn the slab over so that the bottom is now the top and you can kind of repurge
[17:40.560 --> 17:44.020]  it the other direction just in case any bubbles got trapped in there?
[17:44.020 --> 17:48.240]  How long are you letting the slab sit in the chamber?
[17:48.240 --> 17:53.620]  Most of the people I know that are making concentrates have upgraded to an across international
[17:53.620 --> 17:54.940]  vacuum chamber.
[17:54.940 --> 17:58.620]  We can actually watch the concentrate bubble up a little bit on the tray.
[17:58.620 --> 18:02.340]  Then we can create a vacuum inside of that vacuum chamber.
[18:02.340 --> 18:05.700]  You've got heat and you've got a vacuum and you can make the little muffin in there.
[18:05.700 --> 18:08.860]  Then you can release the pressure and watch the muffin collapse.
[18:08.860 --> 18:14.260]  That way you know that you are getting all of the residual hydrocarbons out of each bubble
[18:14.260 --> 18:15.260]  in that concentrate.
[18:15.260 --> 18:18.280]  Now I understand that you are limited by your equipment.
[18:18.280 --> 18:20.180]  Those vacuum ovens are not cheap.
[18:20.180 --> 18:23.920]  If you are a new concentrate maker, if you are a home grower, maybe that is out of your
[18:23.920 --> 18:25.200]  reach at this time.
[18:25.200 --> 18:28.000]  So we have to think about working with what we've got.
[18:28.000 --> 18:33.240]  I would make sure to purge that concentrate longer than you feel necessary.
[18:33.240 --> 18:38.160]  If you're going 12 hours and you feel like it is good enough, go 24 hours and see what
[18:38.160 --> 18:39.160]  happens.
[18:39.160 --> 18:42.280]  I don't think you can over purge your concentrate.
[18:42.280 --> 18:46.600]  The thing you're going to have to be careful of at that point is volatilizing your turps.
[18:46.600 --> 18:49.040]  If you get too hot, you could roast off the turps.
[18:49.040 --> 18:51.960]  You said you're setting your heat mat to 110 degrees.
[18:52.000 --> 18:57.160]  Again, I am not a concentrate maker or an expert, but from my memory, from most of my
[18:57.160 --> 19:03.440]  reading, I do recall that either cannabinoids or terpenes begin to volatilize around 106
[19:03.440 --> 19:06.680]  degrees is where we really started losing important things.
[19:06.680 --> 19:08.820]  So pay attention to your temperature.
[19:08.820 --> 19:13.440]  When we were first learning to make BHO concentrates and we did not have all of the science, all
[19:13.440 --> 19:17.920]  of the technology, all of the equipment, and most importantly, all of the research, one
[19:17.920 --> 19:23.560]  of the key phrases that many of the makers would say was slow and low.
[19:23.560 --> 19:28.720]  We wanted that slow and low purge, that low temperature, really slow purge.
[19:28.720 --> 19:31.540]  That was what everybody's goal was back in the day.
[19:31.540 --> 19:36.200]  So if you think you are purging your product correctly and properly and enough, I would
[19:36.200 --> 19:38.740]  let it go just a little bit longer.
[19:38.740 --> 19:43.880]  Now without a lab test, you're not going to be able to tell how much butane is left in
[19:43.880 --> 19:45.320]  your final product.
[19:45.320 --> 19:46.600]  There's no way to look at it.
[19:46.600 --> 19:47.720]  There's no way to smell it.
[19:48.520 --> 19:49.760]  You can't see it by looking at bubbles.
[19:49.760 --> 19:53.760]  If you see bubbles in your shatter, how do you know that that is butane?
[19:53.760 --> 19:55.640]  Many people say this has butane in it.
[19:55.640 --> 19:56.640]  There's bubbles.
[19:56.640 --> 19:58.680]  How do you know those bubbles aren't oxygen?
[19:58.680 --> 19:59.800]  Oxygen makes bubbles.
[19:59.800 --> 20:01.160]  That could be anything.
[20:01.160 --> 20:04.280]  When the concentrate was folded, when the concentrate was moved, it could have made
[20:04.280 --> 20:07.560]  an oxygen bubble in there just as easily as a butane bubble.
[20:07.560 --> 20:10.740]  So there's no way to identify a butane bubble.
[20:10.740 --> 20:16.140]  Now if the concentrate is purged properly, you will receive more butane from flicking
[20:16.260 --> 20:22.820]  a lighter to smoke a bowl than you would receive from smoking properly purged BHO.
[20:22.820 --> 20:26.220]  So when you are putting your dab on the dab nail, pay attention.
[20:26.220 --> 20:27.300]  What is happening?
[20:27.300 --> 20:28.500]  Is it sparkling?
[20:28.500 --> 20:29.580]  Is it cracking?
[20:29.580 --> 20:30.700]  Does it taste funny?
[20:30.700 --> 20:31.900]  Does it smell funny?
[20:31.900 --> 20:33.180]  Does it burn your throat?
[20:33.180 --> 20:34.420]  Does it burn your lungs?
[20:34.420 --> 20:35.420]  Does it burn your mouth?
[20:35.420 --> 20:38.520]  Does it leave a funky residue on the rig?
[20:38.520 --> 20:43.060]  Without a lab test, those are the things we're going to have to rely on to determine if there
[20:43.060 --> 20:50.180]  are any residual hydrocarbons remaining in our hopefully finished concentrate.
[20:50.180 --> 20:55.180]  Now I don't have a lot of good ways to test this, but perhaps you could set a piece of
[20:55.180 --> 20:58.900]  your concentrate on something that is flame resistant.
[20:58.900 --> 21:02.820]  Maybe you've got like a metal, put it on a pan and then maybe take your torch and put
[21:02.820 --> 21:04.840]  your torch to that concentrate.
[21:04.840 --> 21:05.840]  Does it catch on fire?
[21:05.840 --> 21:06.840]  Does it burn?
[21:06.840 --> 21:07.940]  Or does it just melt?
[21:07.940 --> 21:11.240]  If it just melts, you've probably got a nice clean concentrate.
[21:11.240 --> 21:16.400]  If it sparkles, if it pops, if it does anything that gets your attention, there's probably
[21:16.400 --> 21:19.080]  something in there you do not want to dab.
[21:19.080 --> 21:23.520]  But without a lab, that is the only way we're going to be able to test our concentrate.
[21:23.520 --> 21:29.480]  I think if there was enough butane left in that product, the flame that you put to it
[21:29.480 --> 21:31.360]  as a tester would let you know.
[21:31.360 --> 21:35.360]  The heat that comes off your dab nail, when you drop that dab into the nail, it would
[21:35.360 --> 21:36.360]  let you know.
[21:36.360 --> 21:38.100]  There would be some sort of an indicator.
[21:38.100 --> 21:42.900]  Your throat, your mouth, your lungs would let you know if there was too much butane
[21:42.900 --> 21:44.500]  left in that product.
[21:44.500 --> 21:49.340]  Now one good thing about butane is it does dissipate very quickly.
[21:49.340 --> 21:51.980]  Butane is not a gas that wants to hang around.
[21:51.980 --> 21:53.200]  Butane is really light.
[21:53.200 --> 21:54.480]  Butane is really thin.
[21:54.480 --> 21:58.740]  So if you've got your concentrate sitting out in a fairly warm environment and you don't
[21:58.740 --> 22:02.500]  have it in a thick layer, it will auto purge itself.
[22:02.500 --> 22:07.180]  In Colorado, when concentrate making was new, it wouldn't be too uncommon to walk past somebody's
[22:07.260 --> 22:12.380]  car and see just a little Tupperware dish with a piece of parchment paper folded up
[22:12.380 --> 22:13.780]  inside of the Tupperware dish.
[22:13.780 --> 22:16.900]  And the Tupperware dish either sitting on the passenger seat or just chilling on the
[22:16.900 --> 22:17.900]  dash.
[22:17.900 --> 22:19.940]  Guys like myself knew what was going on.
[22:19.940 --> 22:24.820]  They're using the heat of the car and the sun to auto purge their concentrates.
[22:24.820 --> 22:26.020]  That's how easy it is.
[22:26.020 --> 22:30.940]  If you are not making ridiculously large batches, if you're not running tremendously large amounts
[22:30.940 --> 22:37.620]  of butane, you can use the sun and a piece of parchment paper to auto purge your concentrate.
[22:37.620 --> 22:42.240]  It sounds like you are a smart enough person to be able to tell if something is wrong with
[22:42.240 --> 22:43.420]  your concentrate.
[22:43.420 --> 22:45.460]  You said that it rips, what did it say?
[22:45.460 --> 22:46.840]  It blows my head off.
[22:46.840 --> 22:49.020]  So it sounds like you've got a quality product.
[22:49.020 --> 22:53.180]  If it's the right color, if it's the right consistency, and it doesn't make you feel
[22:53.180 --> 22:57.660]  bad, if it doesn't taste bad, if it doesn't burn, if it doesn't leave a funky residue
[22:57.820 --> 23:02.180]  or anything on the nail, if you put some of it on a metal surface and light it on fire
[23:02.180 --> 23:07.860]  and nothing bad happens, I'm going to assume you have got a mostly safe product.
[23:07.860 --> 23:10.060]  Again, I cannot see the product.
[23:10.060 --> 23:11.300]  I'm not a doctor.
[23:11.300 --> 23:12.940]  I am not a scientist.
[23:12.940 --> 23:17.820]  I am just some guy with a podcast who is hoping you have done everything correctly and having
[23:17.820 --> 23:19.320]  faith in your skills.
[23:19.320 --> 23:21.220]  So don't take my word for it.
[23:21.220 --> 23:23.700]  If you really want to know, take it to a lab.
[23:23.700 --> 23:27.460]  They can test it for residual particles per million of hydrocarbons.
[23:28.260 --> 23:29.780]  They can tell you exactly what is left.
[23:29.780 --> 23:34.660]  But until then, we've just got to do a few simple at-home tests, which honestly, I don't
[23:34.660 --> 23:39.340]  know how reliable they are, but they may make you feel a little bit better.
[23:39.340 --> 23:43.540]  Throw it on some fire, check on your body, check on yourself, check on your equipment.
[23:43.540 --> 23:47.980]  If everything seems okay, then all we can do is hope everything is okay.
[23:47.980 --> 23:51.660]  I feel like if there was enough butane in there to cause a problem to you, it would
[23:51.660 --> 23:57.020]  catch on fire, it would spark, and there would absolutely be some sort of an indicator.
[23:57.580 --> 24:00.620]  Now, after that long BHO conversation, I do have to give a disclaimer.
[24:00.620 --> 24:02.060]  Be fucking careful.
[24:02.060 --> 24:05.540]  You put yourself at great risk when making concentrates.
[24:05.540 --> 24:08.220]  You are using a very volatile gas.
[24:08.220 --> 24:09.980]  You could cause a lot of problems.
[24:09.980 --> 24:13.260]  It also could cause you some legal problems.
[24:13.260 --> 24:16.340]  So be very careful working with hydrocarbons.
[24:16.340 --> 24:18.300]  Be very careful making concentrates.
[24:18.300 --> 24:22.180]  And please don't blow yourself or anyone else up.
[24:22.180 --> 24:23.900]  That's a disclaimer I have to make.
[24:23.900 --> 24:24.900]  What else do I say?
[24:24.900 --> 24:28.180]  The show from your heart podcast does not encourage, promote, condone, or support any
[24:28.180 --> 24:33.020]  illegal activity, but you're an adult, so do what the fuck you want to do.
[24:33.020 --> 24:34.020]  Hashtag America.
[24:34.020 --> 24:35.020]  All right.
[24:35.020 --> 24:37.660]  I want to give a big shout out to my buddy, Casey Benny.
[24:37.660 --> 24:39.020]  Send me some pictures of your concentrate.
[24:39.020 --> 24:40.500]  I would like to see what you're making.
[24:40.500 --> 24:43.500]  Also, you said you got some seeds from me at the Dude Grows Cup.
[24:43.500 --> 24:46.100]  I would love to see photos of your grow.
[24:46.100 --> 24:47.100]  You never know.
[24:47.100 --> 24:50.580]  I just may share your photos on Instagram or CannaBuzz.
[24:50.580 --> 24:54.100]  All right, Casey Benny, thank you for the great email.
[24:54.300 --> 24:55.300]  Be safe out there.
[24:55.300 --> 24:59.220]  And of course, take a fat dab of that concentrate you're making, and you know the rest, buddy.
[24:59.220 --> 25:00.780]  Give your mom a hug for me.
[25:00.780 --> 25:02.100]  All right, podcast world.
[25:02.100 --> 25:03.900]  We are 25 minutes into this show.
[25:03.900 --> 25:07.060]  I think I'm going to wrap up this episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[25:07.060 --> 25:08.580]  I want to thank everybody for listening.
[25:08.580 --> 25:12.580]  Again, if you've got a question, if you've got a cannabis concern, if you've got something
[25:12.580 --> 25:16.300]  you'd like to say, perhaps you would like to sponsor the podcast, or maybe you've got
[25:16.300 --> 25:19.260]  a product you would like me to review, send me an email.
[25:19.260 --> 25:22.740]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[25:22.740 --> 25:26.180]  You know that I would love to hear from you.
[25:26.180 --> 25:30.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you feel like this episode of the podcast was educational, informative,
[25:30.180 --> 25:33.900]  or entertaining, and you would like to make a financial contribution to the show, you
[25:33.900 --> 25:38.740]  can do so by visiting patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[25:38.740 --> 25:42.940]  All of the information you need to become a patron will be right there on the screen.
[25:42.940 --> 25:47.300]  Just to let you know what I'm doing with the Patreon contributions, the MacBook I am using
[25:47.300 --> 25:52.140]  right now to record this podcast was covered by Patreon contributors.
[25:52.140 --> 25:58.460]  My old MacBook took a shit, and just in time before it finally took its last gasp of breath,
[25:58.460 --> 26:03.340]  my Patreon supporters were able to come through and replace that MacBook with this brand new
[26:03.340 --> 26:04.340]  machine.
[26:04.340 --> 26:07.160]  So that came from the Patreon contributions.
[26:07.160 --> 26:11.260]  Without Patreon, this podcast just may not have gotten this far.
[26:11.260 --> 26:15.020]  Also, the Patreon contributions cover the cost of my website.
[26:15.020 --> 26:17.180]  My website is where I host the show.
[26:17.180 --> 26:22.100]  So having Patreon help cover the cost of the website helps me deliver the podcast to you
[26:22.100 --> 26:23.260]  for free.
[26:23.260 --> 26:25.860]  So that is a way we get the show to you for free.
[26:25.860 --> 26:30.180]  Also, the Patreon contributions cover things like these microphone covers.
[26:30.180 --> 26:34.380]  When Mike comes over, he doesn't have to spit into the same microphone cover that Dav and
[26:34.380 --> 26:36.000]  Granny was spitting into.
[26:36.000 --> 26:37.840]  They really do appreciate that.
[26:37.840 --> 26:42.380]  So the cost of the website, the cost of the computer, the upkeep on some of the equipment,
[26:42.380 --> 26:47.060]  and small details for the podcast are what you guys are covering when it comes to Patreon.
[26:47.060 --> 26:49.140]  So thank you for all of that support.
[26:49.140 --> 26:51.340]  It really does mean a lot to me.
[26:51.340 --> 26:54.980]  And if you cannot support the show on Patreon, please keep listening.
[26:54.980 --> 26:58.180]  I want this podcast to be free for everybody.
[26:58.180 --> 27:04.460]  My goal is to get everybody who cares or wants to grow cannabis to be able to grow the finest,
[27:04.460 --> 27:09.700]  highest quality cannabis, the cleanest, safest, most effective cannabis on the planet.
[27:09.700 --> 27:11.300]  So keep listening.
[27:11.300 --> 27:15.140]  Make me proud by growing the best cannabis you can grow.
[27:15.140 --> 27:16.320]  That's all I ask of you.
[27:16.320 --> 27:20.000]  If you cannot grow, you can follow me on social media.

[29:07.480 --> 29:10.800]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
