[00:00.000 --> 00:04.160]  Hey everyone, it's 3 Tokes and you're tuned in to the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:05.760 --> 00:10.880]  Yeah, welcome back podcast world. It's time for a fresh episode of the Grow From Your Heart
[00:10.880 --> 00:18.400]  Podcast. Your source for cannabis news, education and conversation. That's right, if you're a new
[00:18.400 --> 00:22.560]  grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:22.560 --> 00:27.200]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:27.200 --> 00:32.400]  this my friends is the podcast for you. I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff. I want to
[00:32.400 --> 00:37.120]  thank you guys again for joining me. This episode of the podcast is brought to you by our friends
[00:37.120 --> 00:41.360]  at the Hella Dank Seed Company. If you need new regular or feminized seeds for your garden,
[00:41.360 --> 00:46.560]  I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company and you can find them at dankseed.store.
[00:47.360 --> 00:52.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, smokers and growers, roll up a fat spliff and bust out a pen
[00:52.640 --> 00:56.560]  and paper because it's time for a fresh episode of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:01.700 --> 01:06.180]  Welcome to the podcast, everybody. Just a quick intro today. I have a lot planned for you. You
[01:06.180 --> 01:10.340]  know I like to start the episodes off by letting you know what I'm smoking on today. I'm taking
[01:10.340 --> 01:15.940]  dabs of member berry nectar from Green Dot Labs. Member berry is from our friends at the Ethos
[01:15.940 --> 01:20.580]  Collective. Member berry is skunkberry crossed to the mandarin sunset. That's a great cross.
[01:20.660 --> 01:25.700]  The description on the package says it will taste like cheese, Smarties candies, orange peel,
[01:25.700 --> 01:30.180]  and overwhelming fruit punch. You know I would have to agree with that. As soon as you open the
[01:30.180 --> 01:35.060]  concentrate container, a smell of cheese hits you right in the face. It's not, it's kind of like a
[01:35.060 --> 01:38.740]  sharp cheddar. Comes right out of the package, right into your face. You get the sharp cheddar,
[01:38.740 --> 01:42.180]  then you lean in and you smell more and that's when the candy flavor kind of comes in. You get
[01:42.180 --> 01:48.260]  that Smarties, maybe a fruit punch flavor there. Then when you dab it, that's when the Smarties
[01:48.260 --> 01:53.540]  candies, the overwhelming fruit punch takes over. And then after the exhale, that orange peel kind
[01:53.540 --> 01:59.140]  of kicks in. So it's a really complex flavored concentrate. I really enjoy it. And this gram
[01:59.140 --> 02:02.500]  is not going to last long. I'm going to smoke this shit out of that. So ladies and gentlemen,
[02:02.500 --> 02:08.260]  I'm smoking on the member berry nectar from Green Dot Labs. It is great concentrates. I've got a lot
[02:08.260 --> 02:14.740]  of information to pack into this episode. So let's move right into the grow talk. I'm sure a lot of
[02:14.740 --> 02:20.340]  my listeners are ready for a deep dive into some grow lessons. So let's get right into it and let's
[02:20.340 --> 02:26.820]  talk about enzymes in growing cannabis. All right, before we get into this, I do need to give some
[02:26.820 --> 02:32.020]  credit. I always shout out to greenculturemagazine.com. I wanted to give my brain a refresher
[02:32.020 --> 02:38.500]  in enzymes before I recorded a show. I typed in growing with enzymes on my Google browser. And
[02:38.500 --> 02:43.940]  the first article that came up was greenculturemagazine.com. I honestly went through several
[02:43.940 --> 02:50.100]  articles and this article explained it the best, the most thorough, accurate, simplest,
[02:50.100 --> 02:55.540]  understandable description. So I borrowed a lot of the information from this website. Please don't
[02:55.540 --> 03:01.620]  accuse me of stealing it. I'm telling you straight up, this was my source. So greenculturemagazine.com
[03:01.620 --> 03:07.300]  is where the bulk of this information was updated from in my brain. So I owe them a shout out. There
[03:07.300 --> 03:13.220]  is my footnote to start the show. All right, now let's talk about enzymes. What is an enzyme? Now,
[03:13.220 --> 03:16.820]  don't worry if I lose you here in the beginning because eventually this will all click and I
[03:16.820 --> 03:22.660]  promise it will make sense by the end. What is an enzyme? Enzymes are proteins made of complex
[03:22.660 --> 03:30.180]  chains of amino acids folded into shapes that resemble a Pac-Man. Now, that doesn't mean a lot
[03:30.180 --> 03:34.900]  to a lot of us right now. You've got, you see what? It's a protein, it's a complex chain of
[03:34.900 --> 03:40.500]  amino acids and it's shaped like Pac-Man. Okay. Now that Pac-Man idea triggers ideas in my head
[03:40.500 --> 03:45.700]  really quickly on how to teach things. Enzymes are in your root zone. They're in the soil,
[03:46.340 --> 03:50.980]  eating the bad shit. They're Pac-Man-ing up all the dead roots. They're Pac-Man-ing up all the
[03:50.980 --> 03:55.700]  things we don't want in there. The enzymes are eating that stuff and basically just in there
[03:55.700 --> 04:01.940]  eating the ghosts and the dots. That's what these Pac-Man shaped proteins are in there doing. Now,
[04:01.940 --> 04:09.060]  let's talk a little bit more about enzymes. Enzymes help break things down. They also speed up the
[04:09.060 --> 04:14.660]  breakdown process. Enzymes can also modify and create other organisms. Enzymes occur naturally
[04:14.660 --> 04:20.660]  and are necessary to all life forms. Without enzymes, life as we know it probably could not
[04:20.660 --> 04:29.540]  exist. In nature, bacteria, microbes, and fungus excrete enzymes that live in symbiosis with other
[04:29.540 --> 04:35.700]  living things. Until recently, scientists could not create enzymes. They could only harvest them
[04:35.700 --> 04:42.740]  from living sources. Now, let's talk about some actual uses of enzymes. The most common commercial
[04:42.740 --> 04:48.660]  uses of enzymes, other than alcohol production, you need enzymes to create alcohol. Enzymes are
[04:48.660 --> 04:54.580]  heavily used in the alcohol industry, but other common uses. Enzymes were heavily used for making
[04:54.580 --> 05:00.820]  laundry and dish detergents. The enzymes would get in there and help break down the old food or the
[05:00.820 --> 05:06.580]  organic matter or whatever is stained on your plate. The enzymes will wipe that food right off
[05:06.580 --> 05:10.340]  of there. Or if you've got some dirty clothes, the enzymes will get in there and break down that dirt
[05:10.340 --> 05:15.380]  and that funk and get that shit right out of your clothes. Enzymes were used in making laundry and
[05:15.380 --> 05:21.940]  dish detergents. Enzymes are also used in septic tanks to help break down the waste even further.
[05:21.940 --> 05:27.380]  So if you live in the mountains and you don't have plumbing, you've got a toilet hooked up to some
[05:27.380 --> 05:31.460]  piping that goes to a big tank that's buried underground. And basically when you flush the
[05:31.460 --> 05:36.100]  toilet, all your poop goes into this big tank and it sits in this tank underground. And it does
[05:36.100 --> 05:42.340]  decompose over time, but they fill it with very specific enzymes and those enzymes eat your poop
[05:42.340 --> 05:47.300]  and it dissolves that poop right up. And so you don't get an overflow from your septic system.
[05:47.300 --> 05:54.180]  So that's the sort of stuff that enzymes are good for. I've seen enzymes sold as supplements in
[05:54.180 --> 05:59.860]  health food stores to aid in digestion. They offer the most common that I've seen is a papaya
[05:59.860 --> 06:04.980]  enzyme. It comes in a tube or not a tube, but a roll that looks similar to like a Tums or an
[06:04.980 --> 06:10.740]  antacid of some sort. And it's got that foil thing around it and you unwrap it and you break one out
[06:10.740 --> 06:14.580]  of there and you chew on it and they don't taste too bad. They're kind of chalky, kind of powdery.
[06:14.580 --> 06:18.980]  I think there were mango and papaya were the flavor that I had. You chew on those and the
[06:18.980 --> 06:25.220]  enzymes that are in there are supposed to aid in food digestion. It helps you digest your food more
[06:25.220 --> 06:30.340]  smoothly, more quickly. And it also is supposed to help you uptake your nutrients more thoroughly.
[06:30.900 --> 06:34.100]  I didn't notice anything when I ate it, but I worked at the health food store and they were
[06:34.100 --> 06:40.100]  samples. So that's what I tried, but that is another use for enzymes. All right. I feel like
[06:40.100 --> 06:44.980]  now we are becoming more familiar with an enzyme. We know what the enzyme actually is, and we
[06:44.980 --> 06:50.980]  understand a few practical applications of the enzyme, so it shouldn't sound so foreign to us at
[06:50.980 --> 06:58.100]  this point. Now let's talk a little bit more about enzymes in cannabis growing. Enzymes are very
[06:58.100 --> 07:03.620]  limited on function, and what that means is a cellulose enzyme can only break down cellulose
[07:03.620 --> 07:10.100]  and nothing else. So you need specific enzymes to do certain functions. Now an enzyme can repeat
[07:10.100 --> 07:16.580]  its function millions of times, but it can also be deactivated or destroyed by other enzymes, by
[07:16.580 --> 07:23.940]  pH swings, by temperature, or by a myriad of other options that could happen in a grow environment.
[07:23.940 --> 07:30.180]  Enzymes are fairly stable, but they are also slightly delicate. So let's talk about why we
[07:30.180 --> 07:36.340]  use enzymes. Why are we buying enzymatic products to add to our feeding solution? Why are we doing
[07:36.340 --> 07:43.700]  this? Enzymes aid in simple tasks like getting rid of dead roots, or more complex tasks like
[07:43.700 --> 07:50.820]  accelerating plant growth and assisting in hormone biosynthesis. The most common reason for adding
[07:50.820 --> 07:58.900]  enzymes to a high-performance garden is to keep the medium clean. Now I talked earlier about using
[07:58.900 --> 08:04.660]  enzymes in our septic tank, and I talked earlier about using enzymes in laundry detergent, and then
[08:04.660 --> 08:11.380]  I also talked about using enzymes as a dietary supplement to help people digest food and absorb
[08:11.380 --> 08:16.100]  nutrients better. Now if you think about all those uses, we can kind of see how that would transfer
[08:16.100 --> 08:20.980]  to our cannabis plant. If the enzymes are helping people digest food and absorb nutrients better,
[08:20.980 --> 08:24.820]  that's probably going to happen to our cannabis plants. Now let's think about that septic tank.
[08:24.820 --> 08:29.220]  The enzymes are in there breaking up the poop, breaking up the dead stuff that we don't want.
[08:29.220 --> 08:33.380]  Now when your plants are growing, some of the roots are going to die. That is natural. You're
[08:33.380 --> 08:39.380]  going to have decomposing matter in your root zone. Those enzymes are going to get in there
[08:39.380 --> 08:46.500]  and eat that stuff up and turn it into usable fuel before it's able to become a problem. That is a
[08:46.500 --> 08:52.660]  vector for problems, pathogens and disease, when you've got something decaying in your root zone.
[08:52.660 --> 08:56.500]  So these enzymes will get in there and they'll go, hey, look at that shit. Nom, nom, nom, nom,
[08:56.500 --> 09:00.420]  nom, and they'll chew it up and they'll turn it into plant energy for your plants. Now the same
[09:00.420 --> 09:04.580]  thing with the laundry detergent. It's getting in there and breaking things down. It's cleaning it
[09:04.580 --> 09:08.900]  up. It's going to get in there and break things down and clean up your root zone. So in short
[09:08.900 --> 09:12.580]  terms, these enzymes are getting in there and acting like those scrubbing bubbles. Remember
[09:12.580 --> 09:16.180]  the old commercials with the scrubbing bubbles? That's scrubbing bubbles in Pac-Man, getting in
[09:16.180 --> 09:20.660]  there and eating the ghosts, eating the dots, scrubbing the bubbles, getting the dead poop out,
[09:20.660 --> 09:25.540]  getting those dead roots out, and keeping your root zone healthy and clean. So enzymes kind of
[09:25.620 --> 09:31.700]  act as a protectant, maybe a security guard of sorts against disease and pathogens within the
[09:31.700 --> 09:35.860]  root zone. So they're acting like those scrubbing bubbles. They're in there scrubbing the problems
[09:35.860 --> 09:42.180]  out. Maybe those dead roots are ghosts and little pathogens and disease are the little dots and
[09:42.180 --> 09:45.300]  they're just Pac-Man-ing the shit out of those little things in there, just miss Pac-Man and
[09:45.300 --> 09:50.420]  Pac-Man just in there living their Pac-Man midway life, just chasing those ghosts around. All right,
[09:50.420 --> 09:54.900]  let's get back on track, you guys. Earlier, I mentioned that specific enzymes can only perform
[09:54.900 --> 10:01.300]  specific functions. Some enzyme products break down dead roots. Some enzyme products break down
[10:01.300 --> 10:07.380]  bad bacterias. Some enzyme products help improve soil health by breaking down dead material into
[10:07.380 --> 10:13.220]  useful sugars and minerals. Now, how do I know which enzymes I need and which enzymes I'm
[10:13.220 --> 10:17.780]  getting? Each company has their own proprietary blend of enzymes that they put in the bottle.
[10:18.580 --> 10:22.580]  I'm going to talk about a test in a few minutes on ways we can tell if there are a couple of
[10:22.580 --> 10:27.380]  enzymes in there. But basically, unless you can do these tests, we've just got to trust these
[10:27.380 --> 10:33.620]  companies. But we'll talk more about that in a minute. So basically, enzymes act as an accelerator
[10:33.620 --> 10:39.140]  for chemical reactions that are produced in the soil. And they do that by breaking down or
[10:39.140 --> 10:44.580]  speeding up the breakdown process of dead root matter, of bad bacteria, of things that are
[10:44.580 --> 10:50.020]  unwelcome and unwanted. And they turn that into usable sugars and minerals for the plants. So
[10:50.020 --> 10:55.380]  they're in there turning funk into food for you is basically what your enzymes are doing.
[10:56.020 --> 11:01.060]  Now, most of your commercially available bottle nutrients are going to be made through fermentation.
[11:01.060 --> 11:06.580]  They ferment vegetables, which creates a trichoderma, which allows the enzymes to spread.
[11:07.220 --> 11:12.180]  They keep that production happening. Then they collect the enzymes into a bottle. Then they
[11:12.180 --> 11:17.060]  dilute it. Then they sell it to us. Well, then they sell it to a distributor who sells it to a
[11:17.060 --> 11:22.100]  growth store, who then sells it to us after it's been shipped across the country. So it's hard to
[11:22.100 --> 11:26.660]  know if the enzymes in that bottle are even alive by the time it makes it to us. And it's hard to
[11:26.660 --> 11:32.900]  know what's even in there. So you can make your own enzymes. You can make enzymes with a Bokashi
[11:32.900 --> 11:37.140]  bucket. I've talked about the Bokashi bucket before. Some of that leachate stuff that comes
[11:37.140 --> 11:42.660]  out, that juice, that terrible smelling vomit, poop-smelled juice that comes out, that is loaded
[11:42.660 --> 11:47.140]  with enzymes. There's a lot of great stuff in there. It's a good portion of enzymes. I've used
[11:47.140 --> 11:53.380]  that stuff. If you have a clogged drain, the enzymes in that Bokashi bucket will dissolve a
[11:53.380 --> 11:57.380]  funky clog in your drain. So that tells you about the enzymes that are in there. If you're going to
[11:57.380 --> 12:03.460]  use that in your plants, use it very sparingly, a very little bit per gallon of water. I put maybe
[12:03.460 --> 12:09.220]  an ounce in a 25-gallon container of water. So you don't need a lot of that stuff. But you can make
[12:09.220 --> 12:13.700]  your own enzymes through the Bokashi bucket. They're just as effective and they're basically
[12:13.700 --> 12:17.940]  free. And they're actually, I think you're making money doing that because you're putting
[12:17.940 --> 12:23.220]  food scraps that would have gone into the trash, into the Bokashi bucket. So now you're making
[12:23.220 --> 12:26.980]  money because you're not putting something into the trash. You're reusing a product. You're turning
[12:26.980 --> 12:30.420]  it into something that you're going to feed your plants. Now you and your plants are eating the
[12:30.420 --> 12:33.860]  same diet. It's going to make you think a little more about it. And it's going to make you take
[12:33.860 --> 12:37.540]  better care of yourself and your plants. And it will encourage your dietary decisions when you're
[12:37.540 --> 12:41.220]  shopping because you'll go to buy something and you'll say, Oh, I can't put that in the Bokashi
[12:41.220 --> 12:46.420]  bucket. And you'll start eating more raw, healthy foods. It'll be good for you. So it's a chain
[12:46.420 --> 12:50.180]  reaction. When you start loving the plants and realizing what goes into these plants, you say,
[12:50.180 --> 12:54.660]  why do I spend all the money on the best nutrients? But then I stop at fucking McDonald's and feed
[12:54.660 --> 12:59.220]  myself shit. You're going to start feeding yourself the top shelf nutrients also. So let me figure out
[12:59.220 --> 13:03.620]  where I was in this rant and we will get back on this. You can make your own enzymes with the
[13:03.620 --> 13:07.540]  Bokashi bucket. If you're not familiar with the Bokashi bucket, it's really easy to find,
[13:07.540 --> 13:14.500]  do some simple research on that. It will change your growing life. Also another very good use
[13:14.500 --> 13:20.180]  of bottled enzymes is if you are going to recycle cocoa, or if you're going to recycle your soil,
[13:20.180 --> 13:25.140]  I highly recommend you mix up some water. And while that cocoa or that dirt is still in the
[13:25.140 --> 13:29.380]  pots, let's say you've harvested the plants. You've got that little nub of a stick sticking out.
[13:29.380 --> 13:33.060]  You're going to carry those pots off to wherever, and then that soil is going to get recycled. If
[13:33.060 --> 13:38.500]  you don't have a container to dump all of that soil into while it's still in the grow room,
[13:39.460 --> 13:46.900]  run a strong feed of water and just enzymes through those plants mix up. If it says two
[13:46.900 --> 13:51.780]  mils per gallon, do four, put four mils in there and just water those plants until you get a bit
[13:51.780 --> 13:56.100]  of a little bit of runoff. There's no plants in there. It's just a pot with dirt in there.
[13:56.100 --> 14:00.340]  Those enzymes are going to get in there. If you plan on recycling that soil or recycling that
[14:00.340 --> 14:04.260]  cocoa, that's going to get in there and break down all the dead shit, all the leftover shit
[14:04.260 --> 14:07.700]  that you don't want. It's going to clean that stuff right out of there. If you're going to
[14:07.700 --> 14:13.060]  combine it all together into a giant container, if you can do that, stir it up, get it all combined,
[14:13.060 --> 14:16.900]  then run the enzyme water through there, do that. But that's going to be a much larger
[14:16.900 --> 14:20.820]  container of water to deal with. You're going to have a much larger mess. You're probably used to
[14:20.820 --> 14:26.420]  watering nine or 10, three or five gallon pots already. So that's probably easier for you to do.
[14:26.420 --> 14:30.980]  That's a good way to recycle your soil. Earlier, I mentioned that we were going to talk about a
[14:30.980 --> 14:36.420]  test to determine which enzymes are actually contained within the bottles that we're
[14:36.420 --> 14:40.420]  purchasing. I'm not going to talk about any branding because that is up to you to do your
[14:40.420 --> 14:45.700]  shopping, do your research, just buy quality enzymes. I don't know who to recommend right
[14:45.700 --> 14:50.500]  now because I'm making mine with the Bokashi bucket. There are several brands out there.
[14:50.500 --> 14:54.660]  I'm not sure if you're getting anything extra when you buy those really expensive brands. They
[14:54.660 --> 14:59.140]  may be selling you the exact same thing as the lesser costing brands. I don't know what's in
[14:59.140 --> 15:05.220]  there, but we're going to talk about a test to determine what is in our enzyme bottles.
[15:06.020 --> 15:11.860]  Now, this test will tell us if the enzymes we purchased are able to break down cellulose and
[15:11.860 --> 15:18.420]  hemicellulose, which are two components of root material. Now, the first test, pour some of your
[15:18.420 --> 15:25.220]  enzymes into a small dish and simply drop a small square of paper into that dish. Now, the enzymes
[15:25.220 --> 15:30.740]  have to cover and coat this little piece of paper. Now, once that happens, if the paper is destroyed
[15:30.740 --> 15:36.260]  and eaten up by the enzymes, that is proof positive that there are enzymes in there that are able to
[15:36.260 --> 15:43.060]  break down cellulose. Now, the second test will be done to determine the presence of hemicellulose.
[15:43.060 --> 15:46.740]  I may be saying that wrong. If I'm saying hemicellulose wrong, please do correct me so that
[15:46.740 --> 15:52.980]  I can sound smart in the next episode. Now, here's what you do. Get some applesauce and pour some of that
[15:54.340 --> 15:58.020]  enzyme product right into the applesauce. So don't pour into the whole jar, you guys. Get a little
[15:58.020 --> 16:02.740]  dish, just a little container of applesauce, and pour some of your enzyme product into the
[16:02.740 --> 16:07.300]  applesauce. Now, if the applesauce becomes liquidy, if it eats up the chunks of apple and just makes
[16:07.300 --> 16:14.260]  it a liquid, you can see that there are enzymes in there that are able to break up hemicellulose.
[16:14.260 --> 16:20.580]  You can visually assess that those enzymes are there and working. Now, this may not work with
[16:20.580 --> 16:26.900]  all products, and if it doesn't work, it does not mean there are not enzymes in your product. It just
[16:26.900 --> 16:33.220]  means that cellulose and hemicellulose are not present or active in the product which you purchased.
[16:33.220 --> 16:37.540]  Now, we talked about it earlier. There are many different kinds of enzymes, and each has its own
[16:37.540 --> 16:44.020]  specific function or a specific target. Now, we also know that plants create their own enzymes,
[16:44.020 --> 16:49.300]  so if the brand of enzymes you're purchasing doesn't contain a specific enzyme, don't be
[16:49.300 --> 16:53.380]  afraid to get another product, an enzymatic product, and back it up with that one. I don't
[16:53.380 --> 16:57.140]  think you can overdose these plants with enzymes. They'll all balance each other out. They'll all
[16:57.140 --> 17:01.860]  be used for something. If one isn't needed, another enzyme will probably destroy it and
[17:01.860 --> 17:07.140]  turn it into something that is needed for the plants at that time. So some products that are
[17:07.140 --> 17:12.740]  sold as enzymes are not even enzymes, but they're blends of microbes and fungi, but when they work
[17:12.740 --> 17:18.260]  properly, they will populate and secrete the enzymes that we need, but that's only possible
[17:18.260 --> 17:23.140]  if the microbes are still alive and they're able to reproduce fast enough to be useful,
[17:23.140 --> 17:28.900]  and like I said earlier, you don't know what's in that bottle until you do a test on your product
[17:28.900 --> 17:35.540]  yourself at home. All right, you guys, that was about 17 minutes worth of information on enzymes.
[17:35.540 --> 17:40.420]  Again, I'm not going to recommend an enzyme product for you. Do your research. Find the
[17:40.420 --> 17:46.500]  one that fits your budget. There are bottles of enzymes all the way from $13.99 all the way up to
[17:46.500 --> 17:52.740]  $399 for the same size bottle, so don't get sticker shock. Do a little research. Find out what's in
[17:52.740 --> 17:57.620]  there. Find out what's going to work for you. Once you've selected a product, I recommend you use
[17:57.620 --> 18:02.180]  either half or the regular recommended dosage on the bottle if you want. If it says pour in
[18:02.180 --> 18:07.140]  two mils per gallon, try it out. Pour in two mils per gallon. You probably don't need that much.
[18:07.140 --> 18:11.220]  They want you to use extra so that you will buy more, but like I said earlier, I don't think we
[18:11.220 --> 18:17.300]  can OD the plants on enzymes. If the bottle says mix two mils per gallon into your feed solution,
[18:17.300 --> 18:22.260]  just mix up your nutrients like you normally would. Put your base, your micro, your bloom
[18:22.260 --> 18:26.980]  boosters, put it all in there. Then add the required amount of enzymes. Just go ahead and
[18:26.980 --> 18:31.620]  pour that into your measuring container. Drop it right into your nutrient solution. Mix it up. Now,
[18:31.620 --> 18:36.340]  adjust your pH just like you normally would. Go right down the day you started adding enzymes to
[18:36.340 --> 18:41.300]  your mix and feed your plants just like you normally would. Now, start paying attention.
[18:41.300 --> 18:45.540]  Start seeing if the plants are any more vigorous. Start seeing if you get new root growth. See if
[18:45.540 --> 18:51.060]  you have more shoots. See if your buds are bigger. Just pay attention to this grow and see if there's
[18:51.060 --> 18:55.540]  any noticeable difference in the performance of your plants or the potency or the harvest weight.
[18:55.540 --> 19:00.420]  Just pay attention to what changes when you start introducing enzymes to your feeding schedule.
[19:01.060 --> 19:04.580]  All right, you guys, I know it was a short episode, but I don't want to start another topic
[19:04.580 --> 19:08.900]  when I'm 19 minutes into a show, so we're going to wrap it up here. I want to thank you guys for

[21:52.260 --> 21:57.700]  Maybe you need some shit like that, or maybe somebody you really love or care for has a
[21:57.700 --> 22:01.940]  birthday coming up, and they're a fan of the podcast or a fan of iRegenetics. Maybe you could
[22:01.940 --> 22:07.300]  get them like a video birthday card. Maybe I could record them a message, be like, yo, what's up,
[22:07.300 --> 22:11.860]  Billy? I heard it's your birthday. Take a fat dab and give your mama a hug for me, and take a dab
[22:11.860 --> 22:15.460]  and blow some smoke at him. Maybe you could do something like that. Let me know what you're
[22:15.460 --> 22:19.780]  thinking. Reach out. I would love to accommodate your needs and put a smile on your face.
[22:20.740 --> 22:24.260]  All right, podcast world, I think that's all I've got for this episode. I want to thank you guys for
[22:24.260 --> 22:28.500]  listening. I know it was a short episode, but I think it was packed with enough information
[22:28.500 --> 22:32.740]  to make it worth putting out this short episode. I don't want to get started on a whole new topic
[22:32.740 --> 22:37.220]  right now. I wrote a lot. I said a lot. My brain and mouth are done, so thank you guys for hanging
[22:37.220 --> 22:41.300]  out. I'll be back in a few days with a fresh episode. I want to give a huge thank you shout
[22:41.300 --> 22:47.780]  out to my friend Roger, and until next time, take a fat dab and give your mama a hug for me.
