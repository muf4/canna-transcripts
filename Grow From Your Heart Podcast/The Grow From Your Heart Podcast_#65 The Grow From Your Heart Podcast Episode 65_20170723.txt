[02:21.340 --> 02:25.380]  from somebody the other day. Let's start with that. Where's that message? Here it is. I
[02:25.380 --> 02:28.380]  want to read this one. I'm not going to say your name on the show because you didn't say
[02:28.380 --> 02:32.460]  if you wanted me to or not. He sent me a personal message and I'm going to read it out loud.
[02:32.460 --> 02:36.980]  It says, Rasta Jeff, big fan of the podcast. I recently finished binge listening to the
[02:36.980 --> 02:41.340]  whole back catalog and enjoyed every episode. I'm somewhat disappointed I now have to go
[02:41.340 --> 02:45.980]  days between episodes, but I'm sure I'll cope. I've learned a lot from the grow lessons with
[02:45.980 --> 02:49.980]  you, Jesse and Spence. It's nice to have a lighthouse in the sea of bullshit that is
[02:49.980 --> 02:53.940]  the internet forums. Dude, I'm glad you pointed that out because that's part of what inspired
[02:53.940 --> 02:58.340]  me to want to do. I wanted to write a book originally, but I'm too scatterbrained to
[02:58.340 --> 03:03.340]  write a damn book. So we did a podcast and part of my goal was to dispel a bunch of the
[03:03.340 --> 03:07.140]  bullshit that we see on the internet and in the forums. So I'm glad you realize that
[03:07.140 --> 03:10.780]  that's what we're out and trying to do. I'm glad you appreciate it. So then he goes on
[03:10.780 --> 03:14.740]  to say, I was halfway through vegging a half dozen plants in bubble buckets when I started
[03:14.740 --> 03:19.020]  listening to the GFYH. Needless to say, I have seen the light and I'm gearing up to
[03:19.020 --> 03:23.260]  switch to soil for the next run and I have planned with hopes of soon becoming fully
[03:23.260 --> 03:27.820]  organic. Uh, dude, don't worry about jumping in fully organic. Just do what you can to
[03:27.820 --> 03:32.100]  get rid of those buckets and start learning how to work soil. Uh, read a few books, read
[03:32.100 --> 03:35.700]  the TLO book like Sean and I were talking about. That'll definitely get you started
[03:35.700 --> 03:40.100]  reteaming with microbes. That'll get you a good start. Uh, don't go too, uh, don't try
[03:40.100 --> 03:44.380]  to be too hardcore about going fully organic right away. Learn how to grow and adjust solely.
[03:44.380 --> 03:47.920]  And we just want you to get there when you're ready. Then he goes on to say, I would like
[03:47.920 --> 03:51.980]  to gain some more insight and perspective from, uh, you on indoor soil setups. You've
[03:51.980 --> 03:55.520]  mentioned you hand water plants most of the time. Does this consist of literally pouring
[03:55.520 --> 04:00.300]  the water to each plant or some other system? I am misunderstanding. And then he goes on
[04:00.300 --> 04:03.180]  and says, thank you for your time and effort. Looking forward to getting my hands on some
[04:03.180 --> 04:08.780]  IRI genetics as soon as they hit NGR. Um, let me go with that first paragraph there.
[04:08.780 --> 04:15.440]  Uh, hand watering. Yes, I mix my, so I run, uh, my personal caregiver grows our soil grows.
[04:15.440 --> 04:20.340]  So I will mix my nutrients into a large container. Honestly, my big batches are mixed up in a
[04:20.340 --> 04:24.380]  rubbermaid trash can. That's how much I mix. And I've got a mark where it's 25 gallons.
[04:24.380 --> 04:29.280]  I mix up a 25 gallon batch. Uh, I'll adjust the pH. If I'm using organics, you can't fuck
[04:29.280 --> 04:33.040]  with the pH too much. You have to accept what it is. Uh, if you're using synthetic
[04:33.040 --> 04:37.720]  nutrients, go ahead and fix your pH. I use a one gallon pitcher, uh, just like you'd
[04:37.720 --> 04:42.380]  get at target, uh, or wherever else you're shopping. I like target, uh, just stick the
[04:42.380 --> 04:47.000]  pitcher right in there and pour it right into the plant. That way. Uh, I have a good gauge
[04:47.000 --> 04:51.140]  of how much I'm putting into each plant. I can say this plant prefers a half a gallon.
[04:51.140 --> 04:54.600]  This plant prefers a whole gallon can kind of measure that way. So yeah, I'm actually
[04:54.600 --> 04:58.820]  hand watering just by using a pitcher and dumping it into the plant. Uh, I run seven
[04:58.860 --> 05:03.660]  gallon pots are my favorites to use. And each seven gallon pot takes a gallon of water.
[05:03.660 --> 05:07.420]  It's a perfect mathematical equation to know how many gallons you need. I don't know. It's
[05:07.420 --> 05:12.420]  easy for me. So never a stupid question. Uh, that was a great question. I'm glad you asked
[05:12.420 --> 05:15.180]  also dude, thanks for the huge compliments. You know who you are. I'm not going to say
[05:15.180 --> 05:19.680]  your name. Uh, thanks for listening to every episode. That's kind of cool. I'm trying to
[05:19.680 --> 05:25.180]  prevent the, uh, the what's it called? The withdrawals by doing episodes more often,
[05:25.180 --> 05:28.620]  but I don't want to burn you out. I save material so that I have something worth a
[05:28.620 --> 05:32.980]  shit so that I don't just show up and give you a crappy show. But if I've got two shows
[05:32.980 --> 05:35.620]  worth of material in a week, I definitely kick them out for you. So thanks for listening
[05:35.620 --> 05:38.580]  to do. Thanks for the message. If you guys want to send me a message on Facebook, I would
[05:38.580 --> 05:43.420]  definitely appreciate it. Read it out loud for you. I want to talk a little bit about
[05:43.420 --> 05:47.780]  what I did this week. Uh, last night, well, actually I'm recording at one in the morning
[05:47.780 --> 05:51.740]  on the, uh, what's the date right now? It's the 17th. So it was the 16th. It's the night
[05:51.740 --> 05:56.540]  of the 16th. It's turning into the 17th. Uh, so the night before last, I guess we'll
[05:56.540 --> 06:01.820]  talk about that. I got the honor to go see one of my favorite reggae bands in the whole
[06:01.820 --> 06:07.260]  world. I got to go see Morgan heritage at Cervantes other side in Denver, Colorado.
[06:07.260 --> 06:11.100]  I drove the two hour drive by myself. A lot of people are like, dude, drive up there by
[06:11.100 --> 06:16.060]  yourself and not a big deal. I listened to a podcast, take a couple dabs before I leave.
[06:16.060 --> 06:19.580]  And it's a great trip. Uh, and then when you get there, you get to a reggae show and I'm
[06:19.580 --> 06:23.260]  a white guy with dreadlocks to my butt. And a lot of the reggae scene knows me. I was
[06:23.260 --> 06:26.620]  there for 10 minutes by myself before I made friends and bumped into people that I already
[06:26.620 --> 06:32.140]  knew. So it was not even going by myself really. So Morgan heritage came out, uh, dude, that
[06:32.140 --> 06:36.780]  man tore it up. Morgan heritage is on fire right now. If you're into reggae, if you like
[06:36.780 --> 06:41.740]  good harmonies, if you want to see a killer live reggae show, I fully, fully recommend
[06:41.740 --> 06:45.660]  you go check out Morgan heritage while they're on tour. Their set list right now is great.
[06:45.660 --> 06:50.700]  Great mix from all their albums. They did a pretty much if I made a Morgan heritage playlist,
[06:50.700 --> 06:55.580]  they would have played it last night. It was perfect. So a big shout out to Morgan heritage,
[06:55.580 --> 06:59.580]  big shout out to Cervantes other side, also a big shout out to Carlos and his crew is good
[06:59.580 --> 07:04.060]  hanging out with you guys made me feel like I was at home. So here's where my night got
[07:04.060 --> 07:09.020]  really interesting. I walked out of, excuse me, I walked out of the venue from seeing the concert
[07:09.980 --> 07:14.380]  and, uh, the band was kind of gathering up by their tour bus across the street.
[07:14.380 --> 07:17.340]  And I couldn't see them because the tour bus is long and they're on the other side. So I walked
[07:17.340 --> 07:23.420]  to the corner where I could just casually lean against a parking meter and stare into the Denver
[07:23.420 --> 07:27.820]  skyline and kind of see the band hanging out by their tour bus, doing their thing. I didn't want
[07:27.820 --> 07:30.940]  to bug them, but I kind of just wanted to observe. And it was a nice night. It was cold, but it was
[07:30.940 --> 07:35.660]  nice after being in the concert, it was nice to get some fresh air. So I'm standing on the corner
[07:35.660 --> 07:40.540]  and, uh, the light turns red and a car stops in front of me, a car stops in the far lane.
[07:41.180 --> 07:46.940]  And then a car stops behind that car and rolls down the window. And the guy in the driver's seat
[07:46.940 --> 07:52.140]  yells, Hey, fuck you dreadlocks. And I'm just standing on the corner in downtown Denver by
[07:52.140 --> 07:59.100]  myself at five points, uh, like two in the morning. And I think to myself, this is about to get
[07:59.100 --> 08:04.780]  sketchy as fuck. So, uh, I reached into my pockets to see what I've got. I've got a little bit of
[08:04.780 --> 08:09.180]  weed. I've got a little bit of dabs in my pocket. I got my cell phone. I got my keys. I don't really
[08:09.180 --> 08:13.740]  have anything that's going to help me out in this position. Uh, I had money in my pocket and I had
[08:13.740 --> 08:16.860]  my weed. Pretty much all they were going to do is kick my ass and take my weed and money is what I
[08:16.860 --> 08:21.180]  was assuming. So I tried to ignore them. I don't know why I thought being an ostrich would help,
[08:21.180 --> 08:25.340]  just ignore them and they'll go away. Right. But, uh, the dude rolled down his window a little
[08:25.340 --> 08:29.260]  further and he yelled another derogatory term about white guys with dreadlocks. I can't remember
[08:29.260 --> 08:33.980]  exactly. It didn't, uh, that wasn't what I was worried about. Uh, but I could look into the car
[08:33.980 --> 08:37.820]  and see that it was full. There were at least four or five, maybe six people in that car. And they
[08:37.820 --> 08:43.500]  were talking mad shit to me. So the dude said, fuck you Rasta. Hardly Selassie. I is what he
[08:43.500 --> 08:47.740]  said to me. And that was when I was like, this guy knows what I'm about. He knows I'm a Rasta man.
[08:47.740 --> 08:53.180]  And he's got hatred specifically for Rastafarians, especially white Rastas. And that's what I am.
[08:53.180 --> 08:58.300]  And I'm all by myself. So I looked down the block to the right and the concert venue was a good half
[08:58.300 --> 09:02.140]  a block away. I looked down to the left and there's nothing but fucking darkness. And I
[09:02.140 --> 09:07.260]  look forward and there's a coffee shop that's closed to shit. Uh, it's me and this car load of
[09:07.260 --> 09:13.340]  people. And they pulled up to the curb and rolled down their window. And it was fucking Chris
[09:13.340 --> 09:17.900]  causes from the source genetics, dude, just picking on me. God, I was like, not sure if I was
[09:17.900 --> 09:22.060]  about to fight six people. I'm not sure if I was about to run down an alley and get chased.
[09:22.060 --> 09:25.820]  I don't know what I was doing. It turns out it's some of my damn friends that just flew in from
[09:25.820 --> 09:31.420]  California and we're looking for a spot to hang out. Oh, nerve wracking, dude. I was shitting my
[09:31.500 --> 09:35.820]  pants. So I run up to the car, he didn't give him a hug. And I was like, dude, you have no idea.
[09:35.820 --> 09:39.020]  And he's like, no, I could tell by the look on your face. And the guy riding passenger seat was
[09:39.020 --> 09:42.940]  like, why are you picking on this man? It was really funny. He had the passenger had no idea
[09:42.940 --> 09:49.180]  who I was. So Chris is like, dude, we're going to a speakeasy that happens to be just several feet to
[09:49.180 --> 09:55.180]  the left of you, uh, walk up the street. We'll park and we'll meet up. So they find a parking
[09:55.180 --> 09:59.820]  spot and I, they get out of the car and they all give me hugs. Uh, it was a chick whose name I can
[09:59.820 --> 10:03.820]  never remember. I think her name is Daniela. Maybe, maybe possibly. I'm sorry. I forgot your
[10:03.820 --> 10:08.940]  name again, sweetie. Uh, Chris Gosses, jibs, a dude named Mike and another dude whose name I
[10:08.940 --> 10:15.100]  forgot. Uh, I might've been high as shit. Sorry. But, uh, so we walked down the street and I can't
[10:15.100 --> 10:19.500]  disclose the location of this place, but we walked down the street half a block and there was a brown
[10:19.500 --> 10:24.380]  door that just looked like a normal door. There was no, there was not an identifying marker on
[10:24.380 --> 10:30.860]  the building, on the door, on anything. Uh, one of my friends knocks on the door, a man opens some
[10:30.860 --> 10:37.500]  blinds and sees us, opens the door, lets us into a small waiting area. I didn't say anything. I
[10:37.500 --> 10:40.860]  wasn't quite sure what was going on. I was just a new guy that just tagged along. They invited me,
[10:41.500 --> 10:49.100]  uh, dude hands the guy at the door, 50 bucks. The guy shakes his hand and says all of them.
[10:49.100 --> 10:53.980]  And so another guy comes in, leads us to a little further down the way and gives us a little seating
[10:53.980 --> 10:58.300]  area and we all sit down and I'm not sure what's going on. Really. I was told that we're going to
[10:58.300 --> 11:03.260]  this little speakeasy, but it was two in the morning and they were serving drinks in this joint
[11:03.260 --> 11:07.260]  and we sat down and I rolled, I had some flowers on me from the concert that I had just been to.
[11:07.260 --> 11:12.540]  I rolled a nice size joint. Cossus rolled a nice size joint and my buddy jibs started taking dabs
[11:12.540 --> 11:17.420]  of solvent lists like it was nothing. My buddy Mike was to the right of me. He started taking dabs,
[11:17.420 --> 11:21.420]  uh, dabs start going around. The joints are going around and nobody seemed to care. We were the only
[11:21.420 --> 11:27.900]  ones puffing in there. Uh, cost has pointed out that that may have been a gay bar. I'm not quite
[11:27.900 --> 11:33.100]  sure. Uh, I'm sure that there were some gay folk in there. I'm not sure what qualifies it as a gay
[11:33.100 --> 11:37.340]  bar, but, uh, it had definitely a different vibe, but you know what? I had a shit ton of fun.
[11:37.340 --> 11:40.540]  There was a pool table in there. I don't shoot pool, but people were shooting pool, having fun.
[11:40.540 --> 11:45.580]  They were serving drinks. I stayed there until four 20 in the morning. Uh, it was a great time.
[11:45.580 --> 11:50.380]  I never would have discovered that if, uh, causes didn't scare the shit out of me. Chris, if you're
[11:50.380 --> 11:55.260]  listening to this, bro, thank you. I appreciate it. But dude, come on. I thought I was going to
[11:55.260 --> 12:00.300]  have to fight six people that night after a reggae show. I just had like the best reggae cleansing.
[12:00.300 --> 12:03.500]  I was feeling so good after that show. And then I thought I was going to have to fight, man. My
[12:03.500 --> 12:07.500]  vibe totally changed. Don't do that to your friends, bro. Actually, Chris, don't ever change
[12:07.500 --> 12:11.500]  you that shit to your friends. I've fucking love you for it. A shout out to causes. Shout out to
[12:11.500 --> 12:17.020]  jib. Shout out to the whole crew in that car. Shout out to the speakeasy. Um, I, I didn't cost
[12:17.020 --> 12:21.660]  me a dollar to hang out and get lit in there. They were super kind. Everybody was cool to us in
[12:21.660 --> 12:28.940]  there. I really appreciated that place. I will be back when I'm in the area for sure. Uh, so what
[12:28.940 --> 12:33.180]  else do we want to talk about? So tonight, uh, so I came home from the, uh, the speakeasy. I drove
[12:33.180 --> 12:38.220]  home. It was starting to snow. It's fucking April in Colorado, snowing, snowing, dude, what the hell?
[12:38.860 --> 12:43.180]  Uh, it was windy. It was pushing my car sideways down. I 25. It was ridiculous. So I got home
[12:43.180 --> 12:48.940]  about six in the morning, a little after six, took a few dabs, uh, slept, dude, I slept most
[12:48.940 --> 12:53.340]  of today. And then I woke up, got a little bit more prepared for the cannabis cup. And then I
[12:53.340 --> 12:59.420]  drove up to Colorado Springs to see my buddy hydro. Uh, I've played hydro songs on the show before he
[12:59.420 --> 13:04.860]  does a secret cup anthem. I saw hydro, I saw pacifier. And that's funny. Now that I say it
[13:04.860 --> 13:09.900]  like pacifier it's pass a fire, but I said pacifier like a baby fucking pacifier. And it's
[13:09.900 --> 13:14.940]  funny when you say it that way. Uh, and fortunate youth at the black sheep. Uh, I'm kind of friends
[13:14.940 --> 13:19.980]  with hydro and I brought a bunch of pretty high quality concentrates with me. And he, that dude
[13:19.980 --> 13:24.220]  travels, he's been on tour with an email. He's got an email in the tour van. So he took me
[13:24.220 --> 13:28.620]  downstage at the black sheep and we just start dabbing, right? And then I'm dabbing and I noticed
[13:28.620 --> 13:32.300]  it was like six or eight, seven or 10 people that want to come around and take dabs with us.
[13:32.300 --> 13:36.380]  So I dab all these guys out. It was cool. They appreciate it. They're all super kind. We get
[13:36.380 --> 13:40.860]  dabbed the fuck out. And then we go back upstairs from the black sheep and this band walks out and
[13:40.860 --> 13:44.220]  starts playing. And I realized that's all the people that I just dabbed out. And I was totally
[13:44.220 --> 13:49.660]  dabbing out all the bands and Hyrie also. So shout out to a super huge shout out to hydro,
[13:49.660 --> 13:54.460]  a shout out to pacifier, shout out to fortunate youth and a shout out to Hyrie. I got those guys
[13:54.460 --> 13:58.140]  high as shit tonight and it was fun. Uh, hope you guys enjoyed my concentrates. I got a lot
[13:58.140 --> 14:03.420]  of compliments on the black cherry cam. So big ups to all the reggae bands. My week is off to
[14:03.420 --> 14:08.860]  a great start. I'll brag more about my cannabis cup weekend on the next episode. Uh, that's enough
[14:08.860 --> 14:12.780]  of me rambling. Let's talk about some news articles. Where do you guys want to start?
[14:12.780 --> 14:16.140]  You want to start on the serious shit? Actually last week I told you we were going to talk about
[14:16.140 --> 14:19.660]  this edibles report and I skipped it cause it was way too long. So let's get into that.
[14:20.620 --> 14:25.980]  This article is from the cannabis and it's by Ricardo Baca. The headline says special report
[14:25.980 --> 14:30.380]  15 months in edibles, still a safety concern for Colorado. I'm going to take a quick drink of some
[14:30.380 --> 14:39.460]  root beer here and then we'll read the article. All right, that's delicious. It says a year of
[14:39.460 --> 14:43.780]  debate, a slew of labeling regulations and multiple educational campaigns have not been effective in
[14:43.780 --> 14:47.860]  answering a critical question surrounding marijuana infused edible products. How do you
[14:47.860 --> 14:53.540]  stop a consumer from eating too much? And then I like the way this is written. It's all like
[14:53.540 --> 14:59.300]  super impacted edibles. Once I want that to be the simple entry for those who wanted to try the
[14:59.300 --> 15:03.460]  newly legalized recreational drug have been implicated in two suicides and one murder in the
[15:03.460 --> 15:09.060]  past 13 months. Only one edibles related death has been confirmed by officials, but the family of 22
[15:09.060 --> 15:14.420]  year old Oklahoma tourist Luke Goodman, who fatally shot himself while on a March ski vacation in
[15:14.420 --> 15:19.140]  Keystone immediately blamed his death on the infused edibles he overindulged in that day.
[15:20.740 --> 15:24.740]  It was a hundred percent the drugs. Kim Goldman said at the time, acknowledging that her son
[15:24.740 --> 15:29.620]  didn't read the government mandated warnings on the packaging and ended up eating five times the
[15:29.620 --> 15:34.900]  state's recommended dose for edible cannabis. What's the recommended dose is a 25, I think.
[15:34.900 --> 15:41.540]  So that means he ate 125 milligrams. I had a hundred milligram clotted bear the other night
[15:41.540 --> 15:46.580]  and I was high. So if this dude doesn't do any cannabis consumption until this point,
[15:46.580 --> 15:50.180]  and he eats a hundred milligrams, he was probably pretty fucking high to tell you the truth.
[15:50.980 --> 15:55.140]  So then it goes on to say much of the regulatory debate around edibles has focused on preventing
[15:55.140 --> 15:59.380]  accidental ingestion, but the manner in which edibles affected person raises the question,
[15:59.380 --> 16:02.580]  whether more should be done to educate buyers before they leave the shop.
[16:03.140 --> 16:07.460]  There's a learning curve for consumers of edibles said Art Way, Colorado state director of pro
[16:07.460 --> 16:12.420]  legalization drug policy alliance. We cannot escape the issue of personal responsibility.
[16:12.420 --> 16:17.060]  That said, the industry should do all that is reasonable in the formative years of marijuana
[16:17.060 --> 16:23.380]  legalization to combat concerns around edibles. Nearly 5 million edibles were sold in Colorado
[16:23.380 --> 16:28.900]  shops in 2014. Not only are edibles high. Okay. I'm going to try that sentence again. Not only
[16:28.900 --> 16:32.820]  are edibles high is more delayed and long lasting than smoking or vaporizing cannabis,
[16:32.820 --> 16:37.460]  but some brands continue to severely mismeasure their products potency. According to a new Denver
[16:37.460 --> 16:43.460]  post commissioned series of lab tests, measuring THCs in 10 popular edibles. And you guys,
[16:43.460 --> 16:46.820]  you'll remember we did a report on that way in the infancy of this show.
[16:46.820 --> 16:51.940]  A bunch of the companies were making edibles. A random person bought them and took them to
[16:51.940 --> 16:56.100]  steep hill labs and things that were claiming to have a hundred milligrams were having 10
[16:56.100 --> 17:01.300]  and then also maybe 200. So it was way off the chart. So it's hard to even say what some of
[17:01.300 --> 17:06.420]  these people ate when they got all fucked up and did stupid stuff. Where was I in the article?
[17:06.420 --> 17:12.100]  Here it is. Earlier this year, it seemed as if the state's legislative pot docket had calmed down
[17:12.100 --> 17:18.020]  after a bustling 2014 of regulations and rulemaking. For edibles alone, warning labels
[17:18.020 --> 17:21.860]  already had been standardized with more information. 10 milligram doses of THC
[17:23.060 --> 17:28.660]  universally had become individually wrapped. The state was working on uniform lab testing standards
[17:28.660 --> 17:33.940]  and users encountered educational campaigns at every turn, movie theaters, pot shops,
[17:33.940 --> 17:39.300]  and interstate billboards. I think that when you're buying edibles, I think you should be
[17:39.300 --> 17:43.940]  given a pamphlet or something would be a good start because I've been to a hundred dispensaries.
[17:43.940 --> 17:51.540]  I work at a dispensary and the bud tender will say, Hey, this is serious. Like take this seriously.
[17:51.540 --> 17:56.340]  And the people don't respect it. They just don't care. And so I think maybe if you gave them a
[17:56.340 --> 18:00.580]  little paper so that they could read it, most of them are going to throw it away, but at least we
[18:00.580 --> 18:05.540]  gave them that paper and gave them the opportunity to read it. Because when people talk, it's easy
[18:05.540 --> 18:08.900]  just to ignore us when we're at the shop, you're looking at all the buds, you're looking at all the
[18:08.900 --> 18:13.140]  concentrates, you're thinking about how much money you can spend. You're just excited. The money comes
[18:13.140 --> 18:16.500]  flying out of your pocket. You put the edibles right in your mouth. You don't even think. So
[18:16.500 --> 18:19.780]  I think if we gave you a little piece of paper to read and kind of showed you some shit, that might
[18:19.780 --> 18:23.380]  be a good start. Maybe make you sign something, but then people don't even want to fuck around.
[18:23.380 --> 18:27.540]  If you have to sign something at the dispensary. I remember the first time I bought a decade dose
[18:27.540 --> 18:32.660]  Chibu Chu, it was when they first, first came out. My friend had a shop and he invited me to get a
[18:32.660 --> 18:37.140]  decade dose and they made me sign a waiver to eat a decade dose Chibu Chu. I bought it and they
[18:37.140 --> 18:41.460]  actually made me eat it there because they didn't want me to give it to anybody. They told me to eat
[18:41.460 --> 18:44.980]  it there and I ate the whole thing in front of them. All right, I'm going to go on with the article here.
[18:45.540 --> 18:49.540]  It says in the wake of Goldman's death, many recalled 19 year old Wyoming college student
[18:49.540 --> 18:53.860]  Levi Tombaugh who became agitated after eating an infused cookie with more than six times the
[18:53.860 --> 18:59.780]  state's recommended dose in March, 2014 and leapt to his death from a Denver hotel balcony. The
[18:59.780 --> 19:04.900]  Denver corner listed medical intoxication as a significant condition contributing to Tombaugh's
[19:04.900 --> 19:10.740]  death. Have you ever been so high you wanted to jump off the balcony? That's fucking high. As the
[19:10.740 --> 19:14.980]  Summit County corner awaits Goodman's toxicology reports in the coming weeks, his death, be it
[19:14.980 --> 19:19.780]  related to cannabis or not, served as a reminder that the edibles conversation is anything but over.
[19:19.780 --> 19:23.860]  As we continue down this road, we really need to keep an open mind, said Louis Kosky, director of
[19:23.860 --> 19:28.660]  Colorado medical, Colorado's marijuana enforcement division. I'm going to continue to say medical
[19:28.660 --> 19:32.180]  marijuana enforcement division on accident because that's what it started off as. I think
[19:33.060 --> 19:37.460]  we have to consider various incidents that occur and work on putting them into perspective as in
[19:38.260 --> 19:42.500]  what things do we as regulators have control over to making things more efficient?
[19:43.140 --> 19:48.500]  Kosky looked to the edibles work group that met four times in 2014 to discuss making edibles
[19:48.500 --> 19:53.940]  clearly identifiable, improving and simplifying the labels on edibles, reminding consumers that
[19:53.940 --> 19:58.900]  a single dose is 10 milligrams and to wait one to two hours to feel the effect before ingesting more
[19:58.900 --> 20:02.740]  was discussed by the work group, which included state officials, pot shop owners,
[20:02.740 --> 20:06.020]  representatives from edibles kitchens and children's health advocates.
[20:08.500 --> 20:13.620]  Too much, too fast. The new rules are due January 1st, but while these regulations might help curb
[20:13.620 --> 20:17.620]  accidental ingestions, it remains unclear if they will stop individuals from eating too much,
[20:17.620 --> 20:22.900]  too fast. Prominent Denver pot shop owner, Ian Seib, pointed to Goodman's suicide to illustrate
[20:22.900 --> 20:27.620]  how much tragedies can't always be prevented by the state, the industry and the regulations they
[20:27.620 --> 20:32.980]  draft. At no point do I feel the retailer who sold the cannabis is responsible for his death,
[20:32.980 --> 20:38.180]  said Seib, co-owner of Denver Relief and chair of the National Cannabis Industry Association.
[20:38.180 --> 20:42.900]  I'm not a parent, but I was disappointed because I know that if I have a friend or family member
[20:42.900 --> 20:47.700]  who's rambling incoherently and not acting himself, I'm not leaving that person alone.
[20:47.700 --> 20:51.780]  See you prefer to Goodman's family who said he was acting erratically and he didn't recognize
[20:51.780 --> 20:56.740]  our present presence. Almost. I had never seen him like this, but they still chose to leave him
[20:56.740 --> 21:01.860]  alone in the condo as they went to the hot tub, according to reports. So this dude was freaking
[21:01.860 --> 21:07.300]  out on a cannabis edible, you guys. Uh, and what he did was walked into the room and shot himself
[21:07.300 --> 21:12.660]  and killed himself. And that's kind of what sparked a lot of the re-examination of the cannabis edible
[21:12.660 --> 21:17.860]  rules. So here's what I want to say. If you come to Colorado and you eat some edibles, respect that
[21:17.860 --> 21:21.780]  shit. It is serious. These aren't the brownies that your sister used to make. These aren't the
[21:21.780 --> 21:26.660]  cookies that your mom used to make back in the seventies. Uh, these are lab tested edibles made
[21:26.660 --> 21:33.140]  by professionals. This started being made for medical patients that had cancer Crohn's disease,
[21:33.140 --> 21:38.420]  severe pain, cachexia. We needed a way to get these people well, and we weren't fucking around.
[21:38.420 --> 21:42.340]  So we figured out ways to make these edibles, right? You guys that are not taking it seriously,
[21:42.340 --> 21:45.380]  you're going to get fucked up and you're going to be on the news and we're going to laugh at you.
[21:46.500 --> 21:50.260]  And then you're going to mess up our laws on our edibles. I want to see how far we are into the
[21:50.260 --> 21:54.180]  show. And I'm going to read a couple more articles. Oh, dude, we're 22 minutes in. We
[21:54.180 --> 22:00.900]  might get another article, maybe two. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. I really want to make sure
[22:00.900 --> 22:06.180]  we get this one in. So we're just going to skip that one and read this one. Excuse me for all the
[22:06.180 --> 22:08.740]  throat clearing guys. Like I've said, if you couldn't be on the show, I have someone to talk
[22:08.740 --> 22:14.660]  to and then you can talk while I clear my throat. Uh, this article is going to piss you off. This
[22:14.660 --> 22:21.300]  one I found. Where's this from? World world news daily report.com. And the article is written by
[22:21.300 --> 22:27.060]  Bob Flanagan. And it said Monsanto creates first genetically modified strain of marijuana.
[22:28.260 --> 22:33.380]  Says St. Louis, Missouri Monsanto, the multi-billion agro business giant has announced
[22:33.380 --> 22:39.860]  today it has patented the first genetically modified strain of marijuana. Right now Monsanto
[22:39.860 --> 22:44.100]  is a breeder. What the hell are they going to be at the cup selling seeds? No, it's not like that.
[22:44.740 --> 22:50.100]  Let me read this article for you. It says the news that has been welcomed by scientists and
[22:50.100 --> 22:54.260]  leaders of the agriculture business alike as it moved forward toward the industrial use of
[22:54.260 --> 22:58.580]  marijuana and hemp products could bring a major shift towards marijuana policies in the USA and
[22:58.580 --> 23:04.340]  ultimately to the world under present under present us federal law. It is illegal to visit,
[23:04.340 --> 23:10.900]  to possess, use, buy, sell, or cultivate marijuana since the controlled substances act of 1970
[23:10.900 --> 23:15.380]  classifies marijuana as a schedule one drug. Although it has been decriminalized in some,
[23:16.740 --> 23:21.380]  to some extent in certain States, Monsanto's interest in the field has been interpreted by
[23:21.380 --> 23:27.460]  experts as the precursor to a major shift in marijuana policy in the U S that is as it is
[23:27.460 --> 23:33.700]  believed the company would not have invested so much time and energy. If it not had previous
[23:33.700 --> 23:38.100]  knowledge of the federal government's openness toward the future legalization of marijuana. Damn,
[23:38.100 --> 23:43.300]  that was hard to read. I'm sorry. You guys a lawyer and marijuana law specialist Edmund
[23:43.300 --> 23:47.300]  Grouch of the drug policy Alliance admits Monsanto's involvement in marijuana projects
[23:47.300 --> 23:52.740]  could definitely help the pro legalization activists. Currently federal law criminalizes
[23:52.740 --> 23:57.220]  marijuana and hemp derivatives because public opinion is still against it. And legal commercial
[23:57.220 --> 24:01.700]  production in the U S is currently handled by a patchwork of small farmers whom are not trusted
[24:01.700 --> 24:06.580]  by investors. A major player as Monsanto could bring confidence within government and towards
[24:06.580 --> 24:12.420]  investors in the market. If it were to own a large part of the exploitable lands and commercial
[24:12.420 --> 24:18.740]  products, that is partly accurate, but I hate that. All right, let me keep reading. Uh, there's
[24:18.740 --> 24:22.500]  presently no way to control the production of marijuana and the quality of the strains,
[24:22.500 --> 24:27.780]  a GM strain produced by a company with the credentials and prestige of Monsanto would
[24:27.780 --> 24:33.220]  definitely lend a massive hand to pro legalization activists with the certain spheres of government
[24:33.220 --> 24:37.780]  and within the business world. He explains I'm fired up because I'm a cannabis breeder
[24:37.780 --> 24:42.260]  and they're talking shit saying that, I don't know, uh, I'm not trustable, but if you use
[24:42.260 --> 24:46.100]  Monsanto, cause they've got credentials and prestige that people are going to trust that
[24:46.100 --> 24:50.980]  shit. It's true, but that sucks just because I've got dreadlocks and red eyes. Doesn't mean I'm not
[24:50.980 --> 24:55.220]  trustable and credible. All right. It goes on to say, although Monsanto is testing on cannabis is
[24:55.220 --> 25:00.660]  only at an experimental stage, no plan has yet been released by the agricultural business firm
[25:00.660 --> 25:04.260]  as to what purposes the patent strain would be used for. Although specialists
[25:04.260 --> 25:08.820]  believe answers should come this fall as rumors of a controversial new bill, which could loosen
[25:08.820 --> 25:13.380]  up laws around medical marijuana is reportedly scheduled to pass before Congress coming this fall
[25:13.940 --> 25:17.940]  critics fear genetically modified cannabis will mix with other strains and could
[25:17.940 --> 25:24.100]  destroy the diversity of DNA. A reality dismissed by most studies claim experts.
[25:24.900 --> 25:31.700]  Um, I've got my own feelings about this because I'm a breeder and, uh, all right. So I think
[25:31.700 --> 25:36.020]  Monsanto is going to find a strain or use a strain that someone they know has been working with,
[25:36.020 --> 25:39.700]  and they're going to figure out ways to manipulate the genetic makeup of that plant to tweak it,
[25:39.700 --> 25:43.940]  to be pest and mold resistant and grow the most desirable sets of traits a grower could want.
[25:43.940 --> 25:49.220]  Right. That would be neat. That would be ideal. So let's see them breed like a high CBD strain
[25:49.220 --> 25:52.900]  that everybody could grow. You know what I mean? Wouldn't that be awesome if Monsanto made a high
[25:52.900 --> 25:57.700]  CBD, low THC strain that you could put in your front yard and grow right next to your shrubs.
[25:57.700 --> 26:01.620]  That would be awesome. Right. Uh, you could grow it worldwide, be pennies a pound. Right.
[26:01.620 --> 26:06.180]  But fucking no, that's not what Monsanto does. It's what they could do, but they're the fucking
[26:06.180 --> 26:10.260]  devil. So they don't, unfortunately, uh, I think this is what's going to happen. I thought about
[26:10.260 --> 26:14.660]  this. I think it's going to lead to a commercialized strain that will definitely suck. It's going to be
[26:14.660 --> 26:18.660]  like cigarettes. You know what I mean? Back in the day, tobacco probably smelled and tastes good.
[26:18.660 --> 26:22.500]  And now it just smells like fucking car exhaust because it's half crap. That's what I think
[26:22.500 --> 26:27.540]  they're going to do with cannabis. Uh, it'll probably be terrible. Uh, I think a big part
[26:27.540 --> 26:32.980]  of why people choose to medicate themselves with medical cannabis is because we don't want GMOs and
[26:32.980 --> 26:37.380]  dangerous shit put into our bodies as medicine. We've chosen to grow our own cannabis or rely on
[26:37.380 --> 26:42.740]  a trustworthy caregiver like myself to grow the medical cannabis for us. So we don't have to buy
[26:42.740 --> 26:47.300]  pills and shit from a company. Uh, it was only a matter of time before Monsanto came into the
[26:47.300 --> 26:50.820]  cannabis game. So here's my big conclusion on all of this. I wrote down some notes and I'm
[26:50.820 --> 26:55.060]  just reading a little bullet points right now. Uh, I see Monsanto teaming up with big pharma,
[26:55.060 --> 26:58.980]  uh, someone creating a medical cannabis program and Monsanto having the only plants in that
[26:58.980 --> 27:07.380]  national medical cannabis garden. Uh, that's how that shit works. Uh, so they'll be, they'll own
[27:07.380 --> 27:11.460]  the patents on the seeds. So nobody else can grow those seeds without Monsanto permission. You'll
[27:11.460 --> 27:16.020]  have to buy the seeds from Monsanto. Uh, they'll also have the monopoly by being the only strains
[27:16.020 --> 27:20.660]  that are available in these medically regulated stores. So that's kind of what I think they'll
[27:20.660 --> 27:24.100]  set up a national medical marijuana program. They'll be like, Oh, you guys want legalized
[27:24.100 --> 27:27.540]  weed? Here you go. Nationally legalized. And then they're going to say, where's the weed
[27:27.540 --> 27:30.820]  going to come from? They'll say, we'll supply it. And we're going to say, who's going to grow it.
[27:30.820 --> 27:36.500]  And they're going to go dun dun dun Monsanto. And we're going to get like that Monsanto OG.
[27:37.220 --> 27:42.100]  Yeah. That's what you want, right? That big 12% THC plant, right? It's going to be terrible,
[27:42.100 --> 27:46.980]  but that's what I predict. That's what I see coming. It's going to get creepy. Um, you know
[27:46.980 --> 27:50.980]  how to prevent that, right? You guys all have to start growing, start growing cannabis,
[27:50.980 --> 27:55.940]  grow your own. Um, it sounds expensive and it seems like a lot of work, but to grow your own
[27:55.940 --> 27:59.940]  cannabis to be self-sufficient is not that hard. Whatever you're paying for an ounce right now.
[27:59.940 --> 28:02.660]  If you're buying it on the street, if you're buying it at a dispensary,
[28:03.380 --> 28:08.740]  you can get better, safer, cheaper cannabis by growing your own. Uh, I know where to get some
[28:08.740 --> 28:15.940]  seeds. You go to nature's green remedies.com do that. So never support any Monsanto fat companies
[28:15.940 --> 28:22.500]  or their subsidiary city areas. Never Scott's a fucking, all that stuff that is available
[28:22.500 --> 28:27.220]  commercially is mostly Monsanto. Like all your gardening products. That's mostly Monsanto shit.
[28:27.220 --> 28:31.860]  Scott's turf builder, all the miracle growth stuff. That is all Monsanto shit. All of the
[28:31.860 --> 28:36.740]  bug sprays and shit you see at all the, all your local hardware stores, mostly Monsanto products.
[28:36.740 --> 28:43.140]  Try to avoid that shit. If you can. Uh, also there is a March on Monsanto on May 23rd across
[28:43.140 --> 28:48.500]  the world. Um, Google that March on Monsanto. Be a part of that. If you want people to go out
[28:48.500 --> 28:53.700]  and March in the streets and talk about how they do not want these genetically modified products
[28:53.700 --> 28:57.780]  on the shelves in our stores. And they do not want Monsanto taking over our food supply.
[28:58.500 --> 29:02.180]  All right. I could rant on that for days. I'll definitely be keeping a personal eye on this
[29:02.180 --> 29:06.500]  topic. Let's see. I got more news. I want to talk about, I want to check in and see how long we've
[29:06.500 --> 29:11.140]  been recording. I don't want to go too long here. You guys get fucking ADD on me 30 minutes. Let's
[29:11.140 --> 29:15.940]  read one more quick, quick news article. I got a quickie here. You guys will like this one. The
[29:15.940 --> 29:21.700]  D D E a is not only seizing less cannabis, they're asking to increase their legal growth three times
[29:21.700 --> 29:26.420]  for medical research. This article comes from the Leafly and who is it written by who gets credit
[29:26.420 --> 29:32.820]  here? Nobody gets credit. Nope, no name on it. So just the Leafly is all or leafly leafly.com.
[29:32.820 --> 29:36.660]  It says the drug enforcement administration is seizing less cannabis year over year,
[29:36.660 --> 29:43.220]  according to its own records in 2009, the agency confiscated and destroyed 10.4 million cannabis
[29:43.220 --> 29:50.580]  plants. Whereas in 2013, the numbers fell to 4.4 million. And last year, the DEA seized 4.3 million.
[29:51.300 --> 29:55.540]  The steady decline can be attributed to fewer funds being made available for enforcement,
[29:55.540 --> 30:00.340]  partly due to the economic recession. And partly because both the public and government stance on
[30:00.340 --> 30:06.020]  cannabis has softened considerably over the years with more States looking to legalize in the next
[30:06.020 --> 30:11.140]  few years, as well as less funding being generated from local and state police asset seizures.
[30:11.700 --> 30:16.340]  The downward trend should continue. Meanwhile, the DEA is shifting from the ones doing the
[30:16.340 --> 30:20.500]  confiscating to the ones doing the growing administration has proposed to increase the
[30:20.500 --> 30:25.700]  amount of cannabis it's legally allowed to produce by more than 300% in order to meet,
[30:25.700 --> 30:30.260]  to meet the demands of researchers who are studying the potential medical benefits.
[30:30.260 --> 30:35.940]  The plant has to offer. If it sounds weird that the DEA is simultaneously seizing cannabis grows
[30:35.940 --> 30:39.780]  and growing their own plants for research purposes, well, it is. And I fucking agree.
[30:39.780 --> 30:45.300]  That's not only weird, that's hypocritical. But hopefully we'll continue to see the DEA
[30:45.300 --> 30:49.540]  shift its focus to regulating the legal market and focusing their efforts on illegal grows and
[30:49.540 --> 30:54.820]  activity that damages the positive progress the industry is making. Besides, we do need
[30:54.820 --> 30:59.380]  more cannabis research to help propel the industry forward. So if the DEA can make it happen,
[30:59.380 --> 31:04.420]  the administration is actually doing something positive for the cannabis community. Yeah,
[31:04.420 --> 31:08.820]  that's true. If they get more money for more research, hopefully they do the right thing with
[31:08.820 --> 31:13.060]  the research. Hopefully they're not trying to prove that it's making people retarded or making
[31:13.060 --> 31:16.500]  fucking people turn into zombies. Hopefully they're actually trying to research that it
[31:16.500 --> 31:21.540]  helps with cancer. It helps with seizures. It helps with nausea. It helps with depression.
[31:21.540 --> 31:27.060]  It really helps with PTSD. It pisses me off that in Colorado, PTSD is not a qualifying condition
[31:27.060 --> 31:30.740]  to get your medical marijuana recommendation. That's really frustrating to me.
[31:31.700 --> 31:36.580]  All right. That's the last news article I want to read. I'm going to close up all the news here.
[31:37.140 --> 31:42.260]  What else do we got? We talked about the news. I did that. I talked about that. I talked about
[31:42.260 --> 31:47.060]  that. I did that one. All right. Oh, the growers meeting. That's what I want to remind you about.
[31:47.060 --> 31:52.340]  April 26th at Hydro Indoor Growing Supplies at 6pm. There will be a growers meeting. I will be
[31:52.340 --> 31:56.420]  there. Jesse will be there. A lot of the people that have been on the podcast will be there.
[31:56.900 --> 32:01.780]  Spence usually shows up. White Mike shows up. Adam will be there because he doesn't have a
[32:01.780 --> 32:05.620]  wife. What's up, Adam? Can't wait to see you there, bro. Maybe we can get some chicks to come.
[32:05.620 --> 32:10.500]  Female growers. I didn't just mean to call you chicks. Lady growers. Come join us, dude. Don't
[32:10.500 --> 32:14.900]  be shy. There's always one lady grower there and then the two ladies that work at the grow shop.
[32:14.900 --> 32:18.820]  We want more ladies to come join the grow team. There's actually a news article about women and
[32:18.820 --> 32:25.460]  growing that I want to read on a future episode. Just don't have time today. What else do we got
[32:25.460 --> 32:28.900]  going on? Come to the grow meeting, April 26th. You'll learn something. I'm going to talk about
[32:29.620 --> 32:34.180]  grow schedules, like keeping your grow rooms organized and moving so that you don't have
[32:34.180 --> 32:37.860]  dead time in one of your rooms. I'm also going to use that for a future podcast.
[32:38.580 --> 32:42.180]  Also, we're going to talk about improving your crops on a future podcast. We'll get Jesse back
[32:42.180 --> 32:46.180]  for more outdoor stuff and, of course, more organics with Sean. I got a lot of great episodes
[32:46.180 --> 32:51.940]  planned for you guys. The next episode will be the Cannabis Cup Review. Oh, man, it's going to
[32:51.940 --> 32:56.660]  be so great. I cannot wait. All right, let's get to the shout outs and start wrapping up the show.
[32:56.660 --> 33:01.380]  It's almost time for the end of this party. Almost time. Shout out to who do I owe a shout
[33:01.380 --> 33:06.820]  out to? Let's give a big shout out to HippieNurse710, Chris Casas, Jibbs, and the whole crew from last
[33:06.820 --> 33:14.020]  night. Also, a big shout out to Hydro, Pacifya, Fortunate Youth, Hyrie, and What's Up, Kevin? It
[33:14.020 --> 33:17.540]  was good bumping into you and taking some dabs, bro, right on for taking care of everybody like
[33:17.540 --> 33:23.780]  that. We didn't have a spot to plug in the email in this club. They didn't have any damn three-prong
[33:23.780 --> 33:30.340]  outlet spots. So, we got an extension cord. That didn't work. We found another room. We dabbed out
[33:30.340 --> 33:34.020]  that room, but then we quickly got kicked out of there. We weren't allowed to dab in that room.
[33:34.020 --> 33:38.500]  Luckily, Kevin had a torch and a rig in his car, and it was close. So, Kevin saved the day. We got
[33:38.500 --> 33:43.300]  to dab out. Big up for that. Let's wrap up the show, you guys. Thanks for listening. I'll be back.
[33:43.620 --> 33:48.580]  I'm really not going to put out another episode until Monday, the 27th, I think it'll be.
