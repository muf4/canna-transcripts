[00:18.880 --> 00:21.640]  Maybe you're eating too many edibles, whatever you do.
[00:21.760 --> 00:23.920]  I hope you're getting lit and well-medicated.

[01:06.400 --> 01:10.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is four 20. It is my pre four 20 celebration.
[01:10.880 --> 01:13.920]  I'm getting heavily medicated for this show today.
[01:13.920 --> 01:17.440]  I am dabbing on crescendo live batter from green dot labs.
[01:17.800 --> 01:21.920]  The crescendo is a cross of chem D I 95 and Mandarin cookies.
[01:22.280 --> 01:27.400]  On the package. The flavor is described as heavy chem gas and cookie dough.
[01:27.600 --> 01:30.680]  I will agree with all of that. When you crack the jar open,
[01:30.880 --> 01:34.240]  you were greeted with a very pleasant cookie dough sweetness.
[01:34.520 --> 01:38.200]  Then that is followed by a gassy chem punch that I really enjoy.
[01:38.720 --> 01:42.880]  As soon as it hits the dab nail, I get a really nice chem gas flavor.
[01:43.200 --> 01:45.960]  The aftertaste is a little bit chemi with some sweetness.
[01:46.160 --> 01:50.880]  The buzz is perfect and very desirable. This is perfect concentrate for me.
[01:50.880 --> 01:54.600]  I love it. I bought as much as they would let me have at the dispensary,
[01:54.840 --> 01:59.120]  big ups to my friends at Colorado cannabis exchange for the great concentrates
[01:59.160 --> 02:01.640]  all the time. I'm opening up the jar.
[02:02.320 --> 02:05.280]  I'm getting punched in the face with that delicious cookie dough smell.
[02:05.560 --> 02:08.160]  And as I look at it, it looks like a beautiful, the texture,
[02:08.160 --> 02:09.680]  the color is perfect.
[02:09.680 --> 02:14.240]  It's a beautiful golden yellow dollop of cheesecake batter right in the middle
[02:14.240 --> 02:17.280]  of the container. Perfect. I want to stop and take another dab,
[02:17.280 --> 02:20.760]  but we're going to continue on with the show. Big shout out to green.labs,
[02:20.760 --> 02:24.400]  big shout out to my friends at Colorado cannabis exchange for keeping me
[02:24.560 --> 02:28.360]  heavily medicated. You guys, I am excited. It is four 20.
[02:28.600 --> 02:32.320]  It is not the normal four 20. Usually four 20 is different.
[02:32.320 --> 02:35.680]  Usually I've got friends here. I've got pros here. We're smoking out.
[02:35.680 --> 02:38.800]  We're having a good time. It is a lonely four 20.
[02:38.960 --> 02:42.960]  The only interaction I'm going to get is going to be digital and virtual four 20
[02:42.960 --> 02:45.200]  action. This is a new world. You guys,
[02:45.360 --> 02:49.280]  I hope you are dealing with things appropriately through the COVID-19
[02:49.280 --> 02:51.560]  situation. I hope you're not going stir crazy.
[02:51.800 --> 02:55.520]  I hope you're making sure to check on your diet, check on your physical health,
[02:55.520 --> 02:58.640]  make sure you're not just eating snacks and cakes and junk the whole time.
[02:58.640 --> 03:01.360]  Eat something good. Maybe go outside and get some fresh air.
[03:01.360 --> 03:03.840]  We're not supposed to go too far. We're not supposed to be around people.
[03:03.840 --> 03:06.440]  You've got a backyard. You got a front porch. Go hear some birds,
[03:06.440 --> 03:09.440]  go smell some air, make sure your pants still fit, right?
[03:09.560 --> 03:12.400]  You may be two or three pant sizes bigger and you don't even know it.
[03:12.400 --> 03:16.320]  So go check on that. Also check on your mental health. Are you doing okay?
[03:16.320 --> 03:17.440]  Are your friends okay?
[03:17.720 --> 03:20.520]  It may be a good idea to watch some comedy and laugh a little bit.
[03:20.520 --> 03:23.840]  It may be a good time to FaceTime a bro or a friend or somebody you haven't
[03:23.840 --> 03:27.440]  talked to maybe check in with some family members. See that everybody's doing.
[03:27.440 --> 03:30.600]  Okay. We can all use a little bit of a hug, a digital check in,
[03:30.840 --> 03:33.640]  get some exercise, check on yourself, check your mental health,
[03:33.680 --> 03:37.280]  laugh a little bit. You guys, it's going to be okay. It's four 20.
[03:37.280 --> 03:38.680]  We're still going to have a good time.
[03:38.920 --> 03:40.960]  And I promise that when all of this stuff is over,
[03:40.960 --> 03:44.720]  we are going to have the biggest. What did we miss? We missed Easter.
[03:44.720 --> 03:47.680]  We missed St. Patrick's day. We were about to miss four 20.
[03:47.680 --> 03:51.280]  We were going to have the biggest Easter St. Patrick's four 20,
[03:51.680 --> 03:53.600]  whatever kind of celebration you want to call that.
[03:53.600 --> 03:56.840]  We're going to do hide eggs and drink beer and smoke a bunch of herbs.
[03:56.840 --> 03:59.520]  That sounds like a good time. We'll probably get Cinco de Mayo in there as well.
[03:59.720 --> 04:01.920]  I'm from Pueblo, Colorado. That's a big holiday here.
[04:02.320 --> 04:03.360]  We're going to miss a lot of stuff.
[04:03.380 --> 04:06.800]  We're going to make up for it when the time is right. Don't worry. All right.
[04:06.800 --> 04:07.920]  As that music fades out,
[04:08.080 --> 04:11.640]  let's work into the part of the show where we do shout outs to our friends who
[04:11.640 --> 04:14.320]  support the show on Patreon. Once again,
[04:14.560 --> 04:17.520]  we've got to do digital and virtual dabs and bong rips.
[04:17.640 --> 04:20.080]  So let's start off with a big grow from your heart,
[04:20.080 --> 04:23.320]  virtual dab and virtual bong rip to my friend, miss Mel.
[04:23.600 --> 04:27.320]  Let's roll up a big fat virtual joint and send that over to my buddy, Dick goals.
[04:27.640 --> 04:32.200]  I've always got a big virtual digital dab for my friend prospect. Once again,
[04:32.200 --> 04:36.000]  let's bake way potent edibles and send them over to my buddy, red beard.
[04:36.360 --> 04:40.240]  Let's get a big fat virtual blunt rolled up for my buddy, the corporate rebel.
[04:40.520 --> 04:44.160]  Let's pack a big digital dab for my buddy, Glenn Geroni.
[04:44.360 --> 04:49.120]  I've always got a big fat bong rip of digital dankness for my buddy,
[04:49.120 --> 04:50.760]  Richard Gramps, Memel.
[04:51.000 --> 04:54.720]  How about a big giant digital dab for my buddy? Komatic.
[04:54.960 --> 04:59.640]  I've always got some too hot of a dab. And also since he's always crossfaded,
[04:59.800 --> 05:04.200]  let's go give a digital dab and a digital shot or a drink to my buddy
[05:04.200 --> 05:06.960]  Aldridge. And last, but certainly not least,
[05:07.120 --> 05:11.320]  let's pack up a big, fresh digital bong load and send that over to my buddy,
[05:11.320 --> 05:14.440]  Paul T big thanks, big digital dabs,
[05:14.440 --> 05:18.320]  and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.

[05:29.820 --> 05:34.000]  And of course I did include that link in the show notes for all of my stoner
[05:34.080 --> 05:36.920]  friends. All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
[05:37.120 --> 05:40.880]  it is four 20 and it is weird. It is quiet around here.
[05:41.240 --> 05:43.760]  Usually at this time of the year, I would be scrambling.
[05:43.760 --> 05:47.240]  I would be getting seed packages and advertising and menus and everything
[05:47.240 --> 05:50.640]  together. I'd be loading up the car. I'd have a hotel booked somewhere,
[05:50.840 --> 05:54.000]  and we would have some really kick ass event to go to and hang out with all of
[05:54.000 --> 05:57.520]  our cannabis consuming friends. All of our industry friends would be there.
[05:57.840 --> 05:59.560]  It has been a weird month.
[05:59.560 --> 06:03.680]  Usually we're hyped up for four 20 from the beginning of April. Ironically,
[06:03.680 --> 06:06.120]  it is four 20, 2020.
[06:06.120 --> 06:10.000]  So it has been four 20 all month and we don't even get to really celebrate.
[06:10.160 --> 06:12.560]  Kind of a bummer. Usually this time of year,
[06:12.560 --> 06:15.960]  I would be gearing up to go to the dude grows cup and we'd see all of our
[06:15.960 --> 06:19.200]  friends at the DGC cup. We'd have a good time, do some vending,
[06:19.200 --> 06:22.240]  do a bunch of smoking, have a little cannabis competition,
[06:22.240 --> 06:24.000]  a little friendly award ceremony there.
[06:24.480 --> 06:27.160]  That event is not going to happen for a couple of months cause we've got to
[06:27.160 --> 06:30.120]  push that back. There would also be one other event, which I would attend.
[06:30.320 --> 06:33.360]  Usually there's one random event. I booked for the four 20 weekend.
[06:33.520 --> 06:36.520]  It is not happening this year. So that is kind of weird.
[06:36.840 --> 06:40.920]  All of my four 20 events and activities have basically been online.
[06:40.920 --> 06:44.080]  They've been on Skype or they've been on zoom or they've been on FaceTime.
[06:44.440 --> 06:46.440]  I've done a couple of things on Instagram live,
[06:46.840 --> 06:49.480]  but that has been most of my four 20 celebration.
[06:49.760 --> 06:54.640]  I did a really cool live show on YouTube with Scotty real and Tenasi gardens
[06:54.840 --> 06:58.160]  and our friend stone trout bum. I thought that was a really good time,
[06:58.480 --> 07:01.720]  but we are lacking in social interaction. I need a concert.
[07:01.720 --> 07:05.440]  I need a comedy show. I need some bros. I need a high five.
[07:05.560 --> 07:08.840]  I need some people around dude. It is starting to get kind of weird.
[07:09.080 --> 07:10.480]  But then when I think about that,
[07:10.720 --> 07:14.920]  I also think about how long is it going to be before we are all comfortable
[07:14.920 --> 07:19.120]  just congregating and smoking together. First of all, congregating together.
[07:19.280 --> 07:21.640]  Do you want to be around a large group of people right now?
[07:21.640 --> 07:24.280]  A lot of people are fine. A lot of people are like, I don't care. Let's do it.
[07:24.280 --> 07:27.160]  Let's fucking smoke. Those are the people we got to look out for.
[07:27.480 --> 07:32.400]  But how long until a lot of us are comfortable getting in a big room and just
[07:32.480 --> 07:36.800]  being together? Do you want 10 strangers in a small room with you?
[07:37.000 --> 07:39.600]  And then, then we're going to think about smoking.
[07:40.240 --> 07:43.880]  Do you want to light up a joint and put your lips on a joint that that guy just
[07:43.880 --> 07:48.080]  put his lips on or that girl just put her lips on or whichever D are you a
[07:48.080 --> 07:50.400]  little bit worried? I might be, I'm not sure.
[07:50.640 --> 07:54.040]  I'm still a little bit skeptical and brainwashed and paranoid over the whole
[07:54.080 --> 07:55.640]  situation. I don't want to get sick.
[07:56.120 --> 07:59.400]  I know my main risk is getting other people sick because I'm fairly healthy,
[07:59.400 --> 08:02.000]  but I still don't want to get a little bit sick.
[08:02.000 --> 08:04.720]  I don't want to be down for a couple of days. I don't want to get slowed down.
[08:04.720 --> 08:05.920]  I got shit to do every day.
[08:05.920 --> 08:09.920]  I can't take a day off for a fucking stupid virus that tried to kick my ass or
[08:09.920 --> 08:11.400]  kill me. I don't need that.
[08:11.400 --> 08:14.640]  So I've been laying low during this whole quarantine situation.
[08:14.640 --> 08:15.880]  I'm kind of taking it seriously.
[08:16.240 --> 08:20.800]  I think the weed growers and the video gamers and also, uh,
[08:20.840 --> 08:24.760]  the fans only girls, all the girls, the thirsty girls, the model girls,
[08:24.800 --> 08:27.680]  the Snapchat girls on Instagram and social media,
[08:27.960 --> 08:31.160]  they're the ones living it up. We've been waiting for this. Uh,
[08:31.160 --> 08:33.880]  we're professionals at this. We've been in training for years.
[08:33.880 --> 08:35.200]  The growers have been isolated.
[08:35.200 --> 08:37.360]  The breeders have been extra isolated for a while.
[08:37.680 --> 08:41.920]  I get a large portion of my social interaction through online stuff,
[08:41.920 --> 08:43.800]  through Instagram live, through that sort of thing.
[08:43.800 --> 08:47.560]  But I've been laying low through most of this quarantine stuff because I really
[08:47.560 --> 08:49.800]  don't need to be out there. There's nothing for me to go do.
[08:49.800 --> 08:51.760]  Everything is closed everywhere to shut down.
[08:52.000 --> 08:55.160]  I can go to the dispensary occasionally and I can get groceries.
[08:55.480 --> 08:57.760]  And those are mainly the things that I need to do today.
[08:57.760 --> 09:02.480]  I drove through the drive-through carwash so that I could wash my car because I
[09:02.480 --> 09:03.720]  was just going stir crazy.
[09:03.720 --> 09:06.720]  I drove around the block about 14 times and went through the carwash.
[09:07.040 --> 09:09.400]  Once the car was all the way dry, I came back home.
[09:09.440 --> 09:12.920]  That's how exciting my day was today. Other than hanging out here and smoking,
[09:13.120 --> 09:17.200]  that's about all I've done. I've done ridiculous amounts of online shopping,
[09:17.200 --> 09:19.760]  but now I'm getting shit delivered that I can't use anywhere.
[09:19.760 --> 09:22.640]  Cause I can't go anywhere to wear new shoes. I can't go out in a new shirt.
[09:22.880 --> 09:25.000]  That's kind of silly right now. Things are weird,
[09:25.400 --> 09:28.840]  but I'm really not sure how long it's going to be until it is not weird.
[09:28.960 --> 09:31.440]  People are going to remain paranoid for a long time.
[09:31.480 --> 09:36.080]  Even if the government or whoever you trust or believe this center for disease
[09:36.080 --> 09:39.200]  control or the epidemic people, whoever you're watching on TV,
[09:39.600 --> 09:42.240]  once they finally say it's okay for you to go out,
[09:42.760 --> 09:44.760]  a lot of people are still going to be skeptical.
[09:44.760 --> 09:45.920]  They're not going to want to go out.
[09:45.920 --> 09:49.040]  They're not going to want to participate. Are you going to want to go?
[09:49.080 --> 09:52.880]  Like I said earlier, be most of the smokey vents we go to where you can consume.
[09:52.880 --> 09:54.760]  They are in fairly small buildings.
[09:55.120 --> 09:57.840]  Those buildings are fairly tight without a lot of ventilation.
[09:58.160 --> 10:01.840]  You can see what happens. I'm a big guy. I take a fairly large dab.
[10:02.240 --> 10:06.520]  When I take a dab and blow it out, I can watch my dab go across my, I'm,
[10:06.600 --> 10:07.880]  I recorded my dining room.
[10:08.160 --> 10:11.080]  My little dining room area is probably an eight by eight square,
[10:11.100 --> 10:13.400]  maybe six by six square where the table is.
[10:13.400 --> 10:16.280]  It's just a little tucked in like a cove part of the kitchen off the kitchen.
[10:16.720 --> 10:19.520]  So the dab fills this area. No problem. Within a few seconds,
[10:19.520 --> 10:22.840]  it drifts into the actual kitchen area. Then it goes into the kitchen.
[10:22.840 --> 10:25.120]  Then it moves over like toward the laundry room area.
[10:25.120 --> 10:26.720]  And then it starts drifting down a hallway.
[10:27.120 --> 10:31.720]  And it only takes a minute for that dab smoke to get all the way into my
[10:31.720 --> 10:33.840]  laundry room, which is the opposite end of the house.
[10:34.000 --> 10:37.960]  And all the way into the kitchen or the bedroom at the exact opposite end of the
[10:37.960 --> 10:39.960]  house takes a minute. And my smoke,
[10:40.200 --> 10:43.600]  which is probably carrying my germs and whatever else has now traveled through
[10:43.600 --> 10:46.160]  the entire house. It is everywhere. I can watch it.
[10:46.360 --> 10:47.840]  The sun shines in through this curtain.
[10:48.080 --> 10:49.760]  I can see where my smoke travels through.
[10:49.760 --> 10:53.440]  If I take a bong rip or a dab in the living room, it fills that living room.
[10:53.680 --> 10:57.680]  As soon as I exhale, it comes out. It fucking bounces off of that wall.
[10:57.680 --> 10:58.600]  It bounces off of that wall.
[10:58.600 --> 11:00.960]  You can see my smoke just kind of swirling and chilling.
[11:00.960 --> 11:02.600]  It looks like a big presence in the room,
[11:02.960 --> 11:05.640]  some sort of smoky apparition just chilling out with this,
[11:05.640 --> 11:08.600]  or maybe it's a smoky vibration. It's a blessing just being there with us,
[11:08.600 --> 11:11.080]  but you can see it just floating around in the room.
[11:11.080 --> 11:14.080]  So you can see my bong rip. And then when we're at events,
[11:14.080 --> 11:18.160]  you can see everybody else's dabs and bong rips, just circling around the room.
[11:18.520 --> 11:21.240]  You watch people blow out real hard. So they got a fresh lung.
[11:21.480 --> 11:24.080]  They don't have any air in their lungs. They're empty. They blow out.
[11:24.080 --> 11:26.880]  Now they just blew out a bunch of fresh air and they go and dab in.
[11:26.880 --> 11:29.200]  They suck that dab or that bong rip in real hard.
[11:29.520 --> 11:32.520]  They get a big fresh lung full and then they blow it right back out.
[11:32.560 --> 11:36.280]  And all of their virus and lung junk just comes out right into the air.
[11:36.400 --> 11:39.960]  And now we're all going to breathe it together. And then they start coughing.
[11:39.960 --> 11:44.080]  So they start breathing even more heavily because they're trying to recover from
[11:44.080 --> 11:46.000]  a big ass dab or a fat bong rip.
[11:46.000 --> 11:48.920]  And all they're doing is sucking in more smoke because those events are so
[11:48.920 --> 11:50.400]  cloudy. So it's harder to recover.
[11:50.400 --> 11:54.120]  It takes even longer and you're just gasping for oxygen. So there are several,
[11:55.880 --> 11:59.160]  before you actually get your shit together and you've just filled the room with
[11:59.160 --> 12:01.560]  all of your junk. And now if there's 10 people in there,
[12:01.880 --> 12:06.360]  imagine 10 people's worth of just junky breathy, filled up in the room.
[12:06.760 --> 12:09.400]  I'm sure we never really thought too much about that until now.
[12:09.560 --> 12:11.840]  I saw people trying to take precautions at events.
[12:11.840 --> 12:15.400]  We always bring the alcohol swabs, the little like a handy wipe.
[12:15.400 --> 12:18.000]  It's an alcohol swab and just a little like a condom package.
[12:18.200 --> 12:21.600]  You pop it open, wipe the rig down, throw that in the trash, keep dabbing,
[12:21.760 --> 12:26.160]  try to wipe it off between every user. But we get lazy and we're friends.
[12:26.160 --> 12:27.520]  It feels kind of rude to be like, Hey bro,
[12:27.520 --> 12:29.280]  wipe that off before I smoke after you.
[12:29.400 --> 12:32.120]  That's part of the point of smoking with your friends is to show that we're
[12:32.120 --> 12:34.280]  peaceful and we're united and we will smoke together.
[12:34.280 --> 12:37.760]  That's where the smoke circle originated. That's part of the whole deal.
[12:38.000 --> 12:38.760]  You bring the pipe,
[12:38.760 --> 12:42.280]  I bring the goods or we both bring half of the pipe and we share the goods.
[12:42.280 --> 12:43.920]  That way we know there's nothing weird in the pipe.
[12:44.200 --> 12:46.120]  There's a lot of things behind smoking together.
[12:46.120 --> 12:48.480]  There are a lot of ceremonies and rituals that involve that.
[12:48.760 --> 12:51.560]  So putting our mouth on that pipe together was part of the whole thing.
[12:52.040 --> 12:54.880]  We started seeing people with a little ceramic or what's it,
[12:54.880 --> 12:58.400]  a silicone insert that pops into your rig or into your bong.
[12:58.400 --> 12:59.600]  And then you put your mouth on that.
[12:59.800 --> 13:02.280]  We've seen people wearing those on necklaces and lanyards.
[13:02.480 --> 13:04.360]  We've seen people trying to take precautions,
[13:04.360 --> 13:07.600]  but not everybody was taking anything seriously when we would go to these
[13:07.600 --> 13:10.760]  events, especially at some of the smoke lounges and things.
[13:11.040 --> 13:14.560]  There'll be people just lined up to hit the same rig. I need to hit that.
[13:14.560 --> 13:15.280]  I want to hit that.
[13:15.280 --> 13:17.880]  You don't see everybody clean it before and after each use.
[13:18.160 --> 13:22.160]  So how long is it going to be before we're comfortable congregating with 10
[13:22.160 --> 13:25.080]  people in a room, 20 people, 70 people.
[13:25.080 --> 13:27.840]  Some of the events we go to have 300 and something people.
[13:27.840 --> 13:29.840]  Some of them are even larger than that.
[13:30.120 --> 13:32.640]  How comfortable are you going to be with that many people in there?
[13:32.960 --> 13:37.720]  Then how soon will it be before you're ready to just grab a joint that you just,
[13:37.720 --> 13:40.080]  you don't know where it came from. You saw me hit it.
[13:40.080 --> 13:41.520]  And then I'm passing it to you. You know,
[13:41.520 --> 13:45.000]  it's at least got my drooling germs on it. How many people before me hit it?
[13:45.000 --> 13:48.240]  How far down is that joint burned? How comfortable are you going to be?
[13:48.240 --> 13:49.520]  How long is that going to take?
[13:49.800 --> 13:51.480]  The world's going to be different for a little bit.
[13:51.480 --> 13:55.520]  And I'm really curious to watch it go because there are many people taking it
[13:55.640 --> 13:56.840]  super seriously.
[13:57.000 --> 14:00.040]  There are a lot of people kind of doing the rules and trying to take it
[14:00.040 --> 14:01.560]  seriously. There are people who are neutral,
[14:01.560 --> 14:04.240]  who haven't changed their day at all. And then there are people that are like,
[14:04.280 --> 14:08.040]  I don't give a fuck about this virus. I'm going to do everything just like I was.
[14:08.280 --> 14:10.720]  So I'm really curious to see how this evolves.
[14:11.080 --> 14:15.200]  I'm really curious to see what it's doing to the cannabis industry right now.
[14:15.360 --> 14:19.720]  Cannabis is selling cannabis, alcohol, sex toys,
[14:19.840 --> 14:23.320]  things of that nature are selling ridiculously fast.
[14:23.640 --> 14:25.880]  Recording equipment is hard to buy right now.
[14:25.880 --> 14:28.560]  If you want specific good recording equipment,
[14:28.560 --> 14:30.680]  it's sold out at most of the music vendors.
[14:31.160 --> 14:35.200]  So some industries are doing very well while many are kind of at a standstill.
[14:35.200 --> 14:39.640]  But right now the cannabis industry is thriving. Unfortunately,
[14:39.640 --> 14:43.960]  many facilities have minimized their staff because they don't need human
[14:43.960 --> 14:47.000]  interaction in the building. If they can do the job with three people,
[14:47.200 --> 14:50.600]  they've got three people working. If it would be much easier with four or five,
[14:50.840 --> 14:53.960]  they still minimize it to three and let those people work their asses off.
[14:54.280 --> 14:58.640]  That way it's just those three people coming and going less people, less germs,
[14:58.760 --> 15:01.600]  less exchange of bodily fluid and bodily air,
[15:01.800 --> 15:05.320]  less contact that minimizes the risk to get less people sick.
[15:05.680 --> 15:08.520]  And those people can handle it because they just work extra hours.
[15:08.680 --> 15:12.240]  And right now that's probably the best thing to do is just be at work or be at
[15:12.260 --> 15:14.800]  home. There's no need to be out in the public. Like I said earlier,
[15:14.820 --> 15:18.360]  there's nothing to do everywhere is closed. My town is a ghost town.
[15:18.680 --> 15:21.120]  Many of the restaurants are offering delivery only,
[15:21.480 --> 15:25.920]  but we've been so far into this quarantine that many of my local
[15:25.920 --> 15:30.120]  restaurants have closed down until the quarantine is over or they have just
[15:30.120 --> 15:34.000]  given up for good because they're not making enough money to pay a staff to be
[15:34.020 --> 15:36.560]  there to wait for the couple of food orders they do get.
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.480]  But the dispensaries are swamped with customers.
[15:39.760 --> 15:43.920]  The dispensaries are doing their best to practice safe social distancing.
[15:43.920 --> 15:47.320]  They're only allowing a certain amount of people in the waiting room at a time,
[15:47.320 --> 15:50.320]  depending on the size of the waiting room. Of course, if it's a six by six area,
[15:50.320 --> 15:52.400]  you get one motherfucker in there. If it's a little bigger,
[15:52.680 --> 15:55.840]  we can fit more people in there. Then once you're in the bud room,
[15:55.840 --> 15:58.040]  they're actually minimizing your time in the bud room.
[15:58.040 --> 16:01.720]  They request four minutes per patient or customer in the bud room.
[16:01.720 --> 16:04.800]  I've been shopping at the medical and recreational dispensaries.
[16:05.080 --> 16:08.280]  The protocols are a little bit different at both places, but it's similar.
[16:08.920 --> 16:12.880]  At the Colorado cannabis exchange, they don't let you pass.
[16:12.880 --> 16:16.280]  Really you walk in the door to the bud room and there's a counter and an ATM
[16:16.560 --> 16:20.560]  just working as a roadblock. That's as far as you can get. It's very obvious.
[16:20.560 --> 16:21.800]  They don't want you going past there.
[16:21.800 --> 16:23.600]  You walk in and you're stuck right there.
[16:23.960 --> 16:27.200]  They have a few things inside of the glass counter on display so that you can
[16:27.200 --> 16:29.440]  see here are the few concentrates we've got left.
[16:29.440 --> 16:32.960]  And then the flowers are behind the bud tender. You can see those clearly.
[16:33.240 --> 16:36.520]  They do have a couple of menus printed that are in the waiting room.
[16:36.520 --> 16:39.040]  So you can look in the waiting room and get a little idea of what you want
[16:39.040 --> 16:40.760]  before you get back there. So that's helpful.
[16:41.320 --> 16:43.240]  But the shopping experience is very different.
[16:43.240 --> 16:46.960]  I'm used to being able to grab the jars and hold them and put the jar of
[16:46.960 --> 16:51.000]  concentrate or the jar of flowers up to my nose and give it a smell and kind of
[16:51.000 --> 16:53.400]  look and see if it looks appealing, smells appealing,
[16:53.400 --> 16:56.760]  if it's the right color and texture. And that's how I make my decisions.
[16:57.040 --> 17:00.880]  This time I had to kind of look through the glass and hope that it smelled good.
[17:01.360 --> 17:05.560]  I shop with green dot labs, so it is always amazing concentrates.
[17:05.760 --> 17:07.760]  I was really satisfied with the crescendo.
[17:07.760 --> 17:11.400]  I had to go back for more and then again for more because it was really
[17:11.440 --> 17:13.880]  delicious. That's perfect for me. It was right up my alley,
[17:14.160 --> 17:16.640]  but the shopping experience is a little bit different,
[17:17.200 --> 17:21.120]  but they are selling so much product. Even with the weird adjustments,
[17:21.280 --> 17:24.640]  the medical and recreational dispensaries are selling.
[17:24.800 --> 17:27.080]  There has been a line every time I have gone.
[17:27.480 --> 17:31.760]  Part of the line could be because it is taking a touch longer to help people
[17:31.780 --> 17:34.960]  because of the different setup. Also more people are shopping.
[17:35.120 --> 17:38.280]  I've noticed that I see different people at the dispensaries.
[17:38.480 --> 17:41.160]  When you go to the same dispensaries on a regular rotation,
[17:41.160 --> 17:44.160]  you start seeing the same people. I'm seeing brand new faces.
[17:44.360 --> 17:48.000]  There are more cars, there's more traffic. They're the only places open.
[17:48.000 --> 17:52.280]  The liquor stores, the dispensaries, very few restaurants. The bank is open.
[17:52.280 --> 17:56.280]  It's drive-through only. There are very few places you can actually go to.
[17:56.280 --> 17:59.320]  So the dispensary and the carwash have been very entertaining lately.
[17:59.560 --> 18:02.400]  Starting to feel like that weird guy that just shows up at the dispensary with
[18:02.400 --> 18:05.720]  nothing to do. I'm like, I'm just here to buy two grams and to see another human,
[18:05.920 --> 18:08.920]  but I'm also trying not to go too often. So I go and I get my limit.
[18:09.240 --> 18:11.960]  And then when I'm scary low, I go back and get my limit.
[18:12.160 --> 18:15.600]  But I also want to go because there's people there and I like people.
[18:16.000 --> 18:17.960]  But my point is the cannabis industry,
[18:17.980 --> 18:22.980]  the recreational and medical and also the free market cannabis industries are
[18:23.160 --> 18:25.240]  thriving here in Southern Colorado.
[18:25.680 --> 18:28.680]  We are lucky enough that they have declared cannabis,
[18:28.700 --> 18:32.280]  recreational and medical cannabis to be essential businesses.
[18:32.300 --> 18:36.040]  They also did the same with alcohol. And there are a couple of reasons for that.
[18:36.040 --> 18:37.760]  I think I've talked about this on the show before.
[18:38.080 --> 18:41.720]  They were going to close the liquor stores. They made an announcement, Hey,
[18:41.720 --> 18:44.480]  liquor stores are to close at a certain time on this day.
[18:44.880 --> 18:49.880]  And everybody in Colorado went to the nearest liquor store and got in line.
[18:50.480 --> 18:52.800]  And it was kind of funny to see that when they're like, Hey,
[18:52.800 --> 18:55.280]  you're not going to be able to buy booze. Everybody was like, now fuck that.
[18:55.640 --> 18:59.240]  There were lines around the blocks and none of those lines were going to be gone
[18:59.240 --> 19:02.600]  by the cutoff time where they said, Hey, this is when you close last call for
[19:02.600 --> 19:07.520]  alcohol. And so eventually our governor said, Hey, maybe we shouldn't do that.
[19:07.760 --> 19:11.640]  They also did that because they thought about the fact that people will go into
[19:11.640 --> 19:16.400]  alcohol withdrawals. Strong alcoholics will die if you cut them off cold Turkey,
[19:16.640 --> 19:19.960]  and that would just overload the hospitals with unnecessary problems.
[19:20.240 --> 19:23.760]  And if you don't give us some weed and some alcohol while you lock us down for
[19:23.760 --> 19:25.720]  several weeks, we may fucking revolt.
[19:25.880 --> 19:28.000]  You may see more problems than you were prepared for.
[19:28.020 --> 19:33.000]  So they decided to leave the alcohol as essential business and cannabis is
[19:33.000 --> 19:35.760]  deemed essential business, which I really find to be a blessing.
[19:35.760 --> 19:38.800]  That gave a lot of job security to my industry friends,
[19:38.800 --> 19:41.240]  because many of my friends are in the cannabis industry.
[19:41.480 --> 19:44.440]  My other friends are in the service industries and they are all fucked.
[19:44.440 --> 19:48.040]  All of my comedian friends, all my waiter and bartender and staff,
[19:48.040 --> 19:51.320]  and whatever type of service. If you bring something to somebody and expect a tip,
[19:51.600 --> 19:53.400]  many of those people are shit out of luck right now.
[19:53.400 --> 19:57.520]  So I'm glad that at least my cannabis industry friends are still in work.
[19:57.960 --> 19:59.520]  And maybe it sounds a little bit selfish,
[19:59.520 --> 20:02.280]  but I'm really glad that I can still get my concentrates.
[20:02.280 --> 20:07.040]  Imagine if we were all just cut off of all of our concentrates, our flowers,
[20:07.040 --> 20:10.160]  our buds, our dabs, our edibles, whatever you do to medicate yourself.
[20:10.160 --> 20:13.200]  If you use sabs or rubbing, if you go to the dispensary and buy something,
[20:13.520 --> 20:15.640]  imagine if they're just like, nah, we're shutting that down.
[20:15.960 --> 20:19.600]  We've kind of established a lifestyle around having these products available.
[20:19.840 --> 20:23.280]  It may, it may make a few people go a little bit more than stir crazy.
[20:23.400 --> 20:24.360]  You can't go outside.
[20:24.360 --> 20:27.920]  You're trapped with your family and nothing to fucking lubricate your mind.
[20:28.200 --> 20:30.000]  That would be fun. You guys,
[20:30.000 --> 20:32.680]  I just realized I've been rambling for like a complete 20 minutes and we
[20:32.680 --> 20:35.720]  haven't covered a subject. We haven't talked about cannabis in any sort of way.
[20:35.920 --> 20:38.440]  It is four 20. I just had a few notes written down.
[20:38.440 --> 20:40.600]  I wanted to come hang out and do a fun four 20 show.
[20:40.600 --> 20:42.760]  Thank you for hanging out with me. I hope you're having a good time.
[20:43.000 --> 20:45.600]  Let's do some serious podcasting. It's four 20.
[20:45.800 --> 20:49.000]  Let's talk about some four 20 related stuff.
[20:49.000 --> 20:51.600]  I like involving my audience in my podcast.
[20:51.600 --> 20:54.080]  My listeners are great contributors to the show.
[20:54.600 --> 20:57.920]  This is one of the times when I call on you for some answers.
[20:57.960 --> 21:02.280]  I want to know what are you listening to while you're smoking? It's four 20.
[21:02.600 --> 21:05.200]  You've got control of the aux cord. What are you going to put on?
[21:05.200 --> 21:07.400]  What are you going to play right now? What kind of music?
[21:07.600 --> 21:10.600]  What's your favorite band? What song? What am I missing?
[21:10.600 --> 21:13.560]  Is there something out there I should really be listening to? What are you into?
[21:13.560 --> 21:16.520]  What gets you grooving for four 20? Send me an email.
[21:16.520 --> 21:21.160]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com or you can hit me on
[21:21.160 --> 21:25.440]  Twitter at G F Y H podcast. Let me know what you're listening to.
[21:25.440 --> 21:29.600]  If there's some four 20 music out there I need to catch on to introduce me.
[21:29.760 --> 21:32.440]  If you've got some stoner music, I need to hear some reggae music.
[21:32.440 --> 21:35.880]  I might be into, or if you've got some obscure shit that you think I might like,
[21:36.040 --> 21:40.160]  introduce me to it or just let me know what you're going to play while we smoke
[21:40.160 --> 21:44.400]  a bowl for four 20 since I'm asking, I'll share a little bit. Um,
[21:44.600 --> 21:48.160]  right now I would probably put on some task and Linus just because I like
[21:48.160 --> 21:51.040]  listening to task and Linus when I'm taking dabs at seven 10,
[21:51.360 --> 21:53.960]  then I would probably put on some rootsy feeling reggae,
[21:54.160 --> 21:57.080]  maybe some eco mouse or something like that right now. Uh,
[21:57.120 --> 21:59.400]  then we may go onto something a little more modern,
[21:59.640 --> 22:02.200]  a little more well-produced cause I want that low tone in my ear.
[22:02.200 --> 22:05.040]  We may go with some revolution or something like that for a little bit,
[22:05.240 --> 22:07.040]  but then we're going to have to go rootsy again.
[22:07.240 --> 22:10.040]  Then we may go some like Morgan heritage or something like that,
[22:10.240 --> 22:12.760]  but then we'll finish the day with fish. Uh,
[22:12.760 --> 22:16.080]  I like to listen to fish in the evenings, just smoke down, listen to fish.
[22:16.080 --> 22:18.720]  It lets my brain wander a lot, just a long fishy jam.
[22:18.720 --> 22:20.720]  When Trey is really lightening it up. Uh,
[22:20.720 --> 22:22.800]  everybody that listens knows I'm a huge fish fan.
[22:23.080 --> 22:25.440]  I'm also a giant grateful dead fan.
[22:25.680 --> 22:29.480]  Many of my strains are named after grateful dead songs and grateful dead type of
[22:29.480 --> 22:34.400]  stuff. So that is where my musical taste is. Of course, rootsy dub reggae,
[22:34.880 --> 22:38.280]  uh, fish and the grateful dead are always going to be my top three choices.
[22:38.720 --> 22:41.120]  Then, uh, I'm a classic rock guy.
[22:41.120 --> 22:45.720]  I was raised with three stoner uncles and of course I had two aunts and my mom
[22:45.720 --> 22:49.920]  who were also semi potheads who liked just good old fashioned classic rock,
[22:50.200 --> 22:53.840]  rock and roll. So I know all that stuff. I love all that shit. It just feels good.
[22:54.120 --> 22:56.160]  I'm also a drummer. I'm a musician.
[22:56.360 --> 22:58.320]  I've been paid to play with a lot of bands.
[22:58.520 --> 23:02.360]  I was known around here as the guy that could fill in for your classic rock band.
[23:02.360 --> 23:05.840]  So I know all of that classic rock stuff. I blame that on my upbringing.
[23:06.040 --> 23:08.960]  The songs were in my head when I started playing drums. I was like, well,
[23:08.960 --> 23:12.400]  let's just learn all of this stuff. And it came out naturally. I know it,
[23:12.560 --> 23:13.400]  it's a good time.
[23:13.680 --> 23:17.240]  Then if you want to kind of delve into the little bit random side of my music,
[23:17.680 --> 23:20.480]  I grew up with like a lot of Metallica type of stuff.
[23:20.480 --> 23:25.360]  So I know a lot of Metallica, Megadeth, Pantera, Pearl Jam, Nirvana,
[23:25.560 --> 23:30.520]  all that 1995 MTV stuff. That's right up my alley. I dig on that shit too.
[23:31.000 --> 23:33.680]  Uh, so that's, that's what I dig on for, for music.
[23:33.960 --> 23:37.680]  When we really need a change and the trim crew is lagging and we've been there
[23:37.680 --> 23:40.440]  too long and you could tell that people are dragging ass and they want to go
[23:40.440 --> 23:42.440]  home Thursday. Like on a Thursday,
[23:42.440 --> 23:45.560]  it's not quite Friday and everybody wishes it was Friday because Friday has got
[23:45.560 --> 23:50.200]  its own vibe on Thursday. That's when I put on that like cheesy nineties, uh,
[23:50.240 --> 23:54.920]  pop rock, fucking just cheesy white guy, rock music. It's poppy.
[23:54.920 --> 23:58.600]  It's Rocky. There may be some bare naked ladies in there. That's not by choice.
[23:58.600 --> 24:01.480]  I just put on like a Spotify channel and play that kind of shit.
[24:01.480 --> 24:04.040]  You're going to get a, what are those guys called? Uh,
[24:04.120 --> 24:08.800]  sugar Ray and fucking bare naked ladies and all that cheesy shit. Uh,
[24:08.840 --> 24:12.120]  what's that other group that I'm thinking of? Somebody wants Tommy.
[24:12.280 --> 24:13.400]  That shit is so cheesy,
[24:13.400 --> 24:15.600]  but when you get the crew singing it and you're all just laughing,
[24:15.600 --> 24:18.120]  it'll bring a totally different vibe. It refreshes the room.
[24:18.360 --> 24:21.000]  So that's like my last resort when things have gone wrong.
[24:21.040 --> 24:25.040]  That's what we put on. It unites the whole crew. Everybody knows that shit. Um,
[24:25.120 --> 24:27.200]  you just start seeing different people sing songs and you're like,
[24:27.200 --> 24:29.920]  I had no idea you would know that one and no idea you would know that one,
[24:30.240 --> 24:32.400]  but that shit works for everybody. It's cheesy.
[24:32.520 --> 24:35.080]  You only play it for a few songs. Once you get everybody going again,
[24:35.080 --> 24:38.960]  you let them pick their music. Uh, one of my favorite things is if I run the grow,
[24:39.320 --> 24:40.960]  if I'm the cultivation manager,
[24:41.000 --> 24:44.560]  the first grower to get there gets to select the music for the grow part of the
[24:44.560 --> 24:46.080]  building. The first trimmer to get there,
[24:46.200 --> 24:48.200]  selects music for the trim part of the building.
[24:48.920 --> 24:50.880]  Then we jam their music for the first part of the day.
[24:51.160 --> 24:54.960]  That's just a little reward. So that is where my musical brain is. I love music.
[24:54.960 --> 24:59.120]  I talk a lot about music. Uh, what else are we going to do? Munchies and snacks,
[24:59.120 --> 25:01.920]  bro. You got some good music on, you just took a fat dab.
[25:02.080 --> 25:03.920]  What are you going to reach for to put in your face?
[25:03.920 --> 25:05.280]  Are you going to have some sort of a snack?
[25:06.000 --> 25:10.560]  I honestly try to not snack too much after I dab
[25:10.680 --> 25:12.520]  because then I just need more dabs.
[25:12.540 --> 25:17.000]  I catch myself in this vicious cycle of dabs, snacks, dabs,
[25:17.120 --> 25:19.280]  snacks, and you never really get to enjoy.
[25:19.280 --> 25:21.000]  I guess you enjoy the shit out of the snacks,
[25:21.200 --> 25:23.960]  but you're always just chasing that high away by eating snacks.
[25:24.280 --> 25:28.240]  So I try to get fairly blazed and don't eat for a long time until it's like,
[25:28.240 --> 25:31.480]  bro, you better eat or shit's going to go wrong. And that's when I liked it.
[25:31.720 --> 25:35.080]  I have food. I like to eat good food. I've been really not bragging here.
[25:35.080 --> 25:36.120]  This sounds like shit for a minute,
[25:36.120 --> 25:38.800]  but I've really eliminated sugar and crap from my diet.
[25:39.080 --> 25:42.800]  And all the snacks have kind of been switched over to like hummus and carrots and
[25:42.800 --> 25:44.560]  like actual good fruit and shit.
[25:44.920 --> 25:48.800]  And since I've quit eating all the sugary stuff and spoiling my face with crap,
[25:49.160 --> 25:54.040]  fruit and real food tastes amazing. And when I drink kombucha now,
[25:54.320 --> 25:57.640]  the kombucha just tingles and dances on my tongue.
[25:57.720 --> 26:01.000]  Since I'm not drinking Dr. Pepper, that kombucha tastes so much better.
[26:01.000 --> 26:03.320]  I know the kombucha is not for some people. If it's for you,
[26:03.320 --> 26:06.320]  you know what I'm talking about. That just sweet kombucha dance,
[26:06.320 --> 26:08.480]  a nice grapefruit sparkling kombucha. Oh yeah.
[26:08.480 --> 26:11.880]  It'll put a smile on your face. But when you get stoned,
[26:11.880 --> 26:14.000]  what are you reaching for to eat? What are you reaching for to drink?
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.680]  I'm probably going to go for like maybe some strawberries,
[26:16.680 --> 26:19.440]  maybe some chopped up watermelon. I like a lot of fruit pieces.
[26:19.440 --> 26:20.760]  That really makes me feel good.
[26:21.240 --> 26:24.160]  It makes me not feel like a piece of shit for spoiling myself with too much
[26:24.160 --> 26:25.000]  crap.
[26:25.040 --> 26:28.760]  I do catch myself eating a lot of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches during
[26:28.760 --> 26:32.120]  quarantine. I think that is boredom eating. I'm just bored.
[26:32.120 --> 26:35.680]  So I go make a PB and J and fucking snack that fucker down because it takes a
[26:35.680 --> 26:37.840]  minute. Cause all the peanut butter, you can't just chow it down.
[26:38.120 --> 26:40.160]  So that's like my crappy snack lately.
[26:40.360 --> 26:43.520]  I think the jelly is a little more sugar and junk than really what I need,
[26:43.520 --> 26:46.480]  especially with all the other fruit in my diet. And then, like I mentioned,
[26:46.640 --> 26:50.040]  I really like a nice kombucha, a nice cold, frosty, cold kombucha,
[26:50.040 --> 26:52.160]  with a nice fizz to it. That's delicious.
[26:52.280 --> 26:55.320]  Or I also really dig an odd walla,
[26:55.560 --> 27:00.240]  the mango madness or a strawberry protein or almost any of the
[27:00.240 --> 27:03.120]  odd wallas hook me up with the fruity flavored one. I'll be just happy,
[27:03.280 --> 27:05.960]  but that's the kind of shit I reach for when it is snacky time,
[27:06.080 --> 27:08.600]  trying to be healthy, trying to take care of myself and do better.
[27:08.760 --> 27:11.240]  I encourage you to do the same thing. I feel better. I feel good.
[27:11.280 --> 27:13.520]  I know that you guys don't care about that. This is a weed show,
[27:13.520 --> 27:15.440]  but when you take care of yourself, you feel better.
[27:15.600 --> 27:17.960]  When you water your plants and feed them better, they act better.
[27:18.120 --> 27:20.880]  Your brain and body will do the same thing. All right. So we got music.
[27:20.880 --> 27:23.280]  We got snacks. What else do you do?
[27:23.280 --> 27:26.240]  Are you one of the people that puts on a movie and watches the same fucking
[27:26.240 --> 27:29.360]  movie over and over again? I can't do that. Once I've seen a movie,
[27:29.560 --> 27:31.760]  I've seen it. I can watch a comedy special,
[27:31.920 --> 27:33.800]  maybe twice because there are going to be jokes.
[27:33.800 --> 27:34.920]  I didn't catch the first time,
[27:34.920 --> 27:38.680]  but bro I don't have time to watch the same movie twice. That drives me crazy.
[27:38.680 --> 27:42.400]  So what are you going to watch? Once you get stoned, we've gotten stoned.
[27:42.400 --> 27:45.640]  We got good music on. We just had a snack. Now it's time to sit down.
[27:45.640 --> 27:48.040]  Are you going to watch a movie? Are you going to watch cartoons?
[27:48.040 --> 27:51.360]  Do you have a favorite TV show? What's your shit that you put on TV?
[27:51.360 --> 27:54.480]  Do you have a Netflix show you go to? Let me know. What are we watching?
[27:54.880 --> 27:58.200]  Then here's the last part that I want to know. Are you a gamer?
[27:58.400 --> 28:00.640]  What are you playing? Maybe you're producing music.
[28:00.680 --> 28:03.680]  What do you do to fidget with your fingers? Once you get blazed,
[28:03.680 --> 28:06.360]  are you going to turn on some video games? If you turn on the video games,
[28:06.680 --> 28:07.520]  what are you playing?
[28:07.960 --> 28:10.720]  I just want to know what my friends are doing after they get stoned.
[28:10.720 --> 28:14.280]  What are you doing to entertain your mouth, your ears, your eyes,
[28:14.360 --> 28:17.280]  and your hands after you smoke? I would appreciate if you let me know,
[28:17.280 --> 28:20.760]  send me an email. My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[28:20.760 --> 28:25.080]  And again, my Twitter is at GFYH podcast.
[28:25.520 --> 28:27.240]  And now since we're talking about 420,
[28:27.480 --> 28:31.080]  I think the most important question is what are you smoking?
[28:31.120 --> 28:33.000]  I always talk about what I'm smoking on the show.
[28:33.280 --> 28:36.920]  What are you smoking? Are you smoking a bong load? Are you smoking a joint?
[28:36.960 --> 28:40.200]  Are you smoking a blunt? Are you smoking dabs? Are you smoking rosin?
[28:40.480 --> 28:43.560]  Did you have to scrape a resin out of an old pipe? I'm sorry if you did.
[28:44.320 --> 28:46.840]  Tell me what you're smoking through and what you're putting in it.
[28:47.160 --> 28:49.800]  Are you smoking some Jack Herro? Are you smoking Golden Goat?
[28:49.800 --> 28:53.440]  Do you have some arise? Let me know what you're smoking and how you're smoking it.
[28:53.600 --> 28:57.120]  And again, my email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[28:57.320 --> 29:02.080]  And the Twitter is at GFYH podcast. All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[29:02.080 --> 29:05.280]  boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes, smokers and growers,
[29:05.480 --> 29:09.120]  clone cutters, pollen chuckers, all you bad motherfuckers out there,
[29:09.440 --> 29:11.320]  quarantinians and coronians.
[29:11.360 --> 29:14.880]  I want to thank you guys for joining me for a 420 episode. Honestly,
[29:14.880 --> 29:17.920]  all the talk about snacks put a little rumble in my tummy.
[29:18.040 --> 29:20.160]  So when it's time to get some food going,
[29:20.680 --> 29:25.120]  I'm going to make myself a little 420 personal buffet over here in the Rasta
[29:25.120 --> 29:29.560]  Jeff palace. I hope you guys have a wonderful and safe 420.
[29:29.560 --> 29:34.080]  Don't do anything fucking stupid. You guys don't ruin 420 for the rest of us.
[29:34.080 --> 29:38.040]  Who are trying to behave ourselves. We will have a great 420 next year.
[29:38.040 --> 29:41.120]  We will make up for this when we are allowed to go outside again,
[29:41.320 --> 29:46.320]  we will have a giant St. Patrick's Easter 420 de Mayo party that is
[29:46.320 --> 29:49.680]  going to kick ass like you have never seen before. I cannot wait.
[29:49.680 --> 29:50.720]  I hope to see you there.
[29:50.960 --> 29:54.360]  Hopefully it doesn't turn into a Juneteenth and summer and all kinds of other
[29:54.360 --> 29:58.840]  stuff all at one time party as well. Oh, I hope this is over soon. Hey,
[29:58.840 --> 30:01.600]  you can hang out with me on Instagram live every Monday.
[30:01.680 --> 30:06.680]  I go on Instagram live at 7 10 PM. My Instagram is IRI underscore genetics.
[30:07.080 --> 30:10.800]  I try to get there around seven, seven, 10. I go on Instagram, do a live video.
[30:10.820 --> 30:14.040]  I hang out with my friends. I answer cannabis related questions.
[30:14.040 --> 30:16.720]  I'll answer just about any question you put in the live chat.
[30:17.000 --> 30:19.880]  I try to talk to everybody and answer every question that comes up.
[30:20.160 --> 30:25.160]  I encourage you to join us on Instagram live every Monday around 7 PM
[30:25.320 --> 30:27.440]  mountain time. You guys, I am in Colorado.
[30:27.440 --> 30:31.280]  Everything I say is in the mountain time zone. Check me out.
[30:31.440 --> 30:33.480]  I hope to find you on the Instagram live feed.
[30:33.720 --> 30:37.640]  Also I will be doing live shows with some of my friends.
[30:37.640 --> 30:41.120]  We will be doing stuff on zoom. We will be doing things on Instagram live.
[30:41.140 --> 30:42.760]  I'm trying to put more stuff together.
[30:43.000 --> 30:45.560]  I've gotten some extra equipment that I shared with friends.
[30:46.000 --> 30:49.840]  So now I've got more people that are able to do shows online from their houses
[30:49.840 --> 30:53.320]  with me. We will be doing audio and video shows more frequently.
[30:53.560 --> 30:57.680]  So please look forward to that and please join me when those are available.
[30:58.200 --> 30:59.760]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
[30:59.760 --> 31:01.320]  I have been rambling for a long time.
[31:01.320 --> 31:03.600]  It's time for me to get out of here and get some food in my belly.
[31:03.600 --> 31:05.600]  And then I'm going to get high as giraffe. Pussy.
[31:05.880 --> 31:07.320]  I want to thank you again for listening.
[31:07.560 --> 31:10.160]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[31:10.180 --> 31:14.240]  Maybe you'll see me today on Instagram live at seven 10 mountain time.
[31:14.480 --> 31:17.920]  I'll be taking dabs and celebrating four 20 all by myself.
[31:18.080 --> 31:21.040]  So look forward to seeing me there. Uh, that's all I've got for you.
[31:21.040 --> 31:23.920]  I want to give a giant shout out to my buddy stoned trout bomb.
[31:24.080 --> 31:27.480]  And until next time, take a fat dad and give your mom a hug for me.
[31:53.520 --> 31:56.040]  All day on the party.
[31:56.320 --> 31:57.720]  Everyone's smoking.
[31:57.720 --> 32:01.560]  Sets me up for 20 rocking out with the mouse.
[32:02.240 --> 32:04.520]  John Brown locked out of the house.
[32:11.480 --> 32:13.520]  Okay. Right before them dinner.
[32:13.800 --> 32:16.200]  Yeah. They took it right before the lunch.
[32:16.840 --> 32:19.560]  So they took it right before them breakfast.
[32:19.760 --> 32:22.040]  Everyone on the sense of me.
[32:26.040 --> 32:28.160]  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[32:28.600 --> 32:31.080]  People say that a sensei party.
[32:31.360 --> 32:34.000]  Everyone jump run like them hottie.
[32:34.440 --> 32:37.000]  Here comes the nutty dready.
