[01:48.160 --> 01:49.160]  Thanks, man.
[01:49.160 --> 01:52.080]  Mike, tell everybody, I'm sure most of the folks know, but remind everybody that's new
[01:52.080 --> 01:54.440]  how they can stalk you on the social media.

[02:00.640 --> 02:04.200]  You guys, also make sure you support his Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis page because there's
[02:04.200 --> 02:06.920]  a lot going on in Pueblo right now. Once you listen to this, you're going to want to go
[02:06.920 --> 02:09.480]  there, and you're going to want to read all the stuff that he's going to post. You're
[02:09.480 --> 02:10.480]  going to want to know.
[02:10.480 --> 02:13.600]  It's going to be a huge marijuana election, folks. Stay tuned.
[02:13.600 --> 02:14.600]  Yes.
[02:14.600 --> 02:15.600]  Huge, huge.
[02:15.600 --> 02:18.280]  Huge. And the new voice that you guys are hearing, kind of in front of me to my left,
[02:18.280 --> 02:21.520]  just a little bit over there on microphone number three, is my new friend, Juicy J Blaze.
[02:21.520 --> 02:24.440]  We're going to call him J today. Welcome to the podcast, my friend.
[02:24.440 --> 02:25.440]  Thank you. Thank you.
[02:25.440 --> 02:27.960]  Man, thanks for reaching out. You reached out to me on Facebook and asked to come on
[02:27.960 --> 02:31.640]  the show. I love it when people do that. I appreciate it. Welcome to the show.
[02:31.640 --> 02:33.440]  Thank you. Thank you for having me.
[02:33.440 --> 02:37.840]  Sitting to my number right, number four, microphone number four. I don't know where that is over
[02:37.840 --> 02:39.160]  there. It's kind of my front right-ish.
[02:39.160 --> 02:40.200]  Your number right?
[02:40.920 --> 02:44.120]  Yeah, we're going to get there. We're all high. I just took like a half gram snake dab
[02:44.120 --> 02:47.240]  a minute ago. It's been that kind of day. Over there on microphone number four, trolling
[02:47.240 --> 02:48.240]  me already.
[02:48.240 --> 02:52.240]  It's Lindsey, the traveling stoner. Welcome to the podcast, honey.
[02:52.240 --> 02:53.240]  Thank you.
[02:53.240 --> 02:54.240]  Thanks for coming back and joining us.
[02:54.240 --> 02:55.760]  Thank you for calling me and asking me to come over.
[02:55.760 --> 02:58.920]  Hey, when I realized there was an open mic, I was like, let's get Lindsey over here.
[02:58.920 --> 03:02.760]  I was super stoked. I just picked up food and I was like, nah, nevermind. We're going
[03:02.760 --> 03:03.840]  to Jeff's.
[03:03.840 --> 03:07.480]  This joint is running like Usain Bolt. If you want to fix that when I pass it to you.
[03:07.480 --> 03:08.480]  Thank you, sir.
[03:08.480 --> 03:09.480]  Working on it.
[03:09.760 --> 03:12.760]  So welcome to the podcast, everybody. Everybody listening. Thank you for joining us. There's
[03:12.760 --> 03:16.600]  a lot going on. Before I get to that, I want to talk a little bit about my weekend. Ladies
[03:16.600 --> 03:22.600]  and gentlemen, I had a good friend bless me with a front row ticket to Reggae on the Rocks.
[03:22.600 --> 03:25.480]  If you've never been front row Reggae on the Rocks, that's a damn experience. Go check
[03:25.480 --> 03:29.360]  that out. It's different. It's way different. What do you got to say? Let's go for it.
[03:29.360 --> 03:33.040]  I just bought my first concert tickets to Red Rocks today, actually.
[03:33.040 --> 03:34.040]  Who are we going to see?
[03:34.040 --> 03:36.840]  I'm going to see G-Eazy on the 22nd.
[03:36.840 --> 03:41.840]  So I'm old and I'm like, I have no idea who that is. It's not just me. Okay, cool.
[03:41.840 --> 03:44.720]  You three make me laugh so hard.
[03:44.720 --> 03:48.000]  Mike and I were discussing earlier that how we're into way different music than a lot
[03:48.000 --> 03:52.440]  of people. Mike's like 10 years older than everybody he works with. I probably I'm the
[03:52.440 --> 03:54.440]  same age as Mike, 10 years older than most people I used to work with.
[03:54.440 --> 03:59.640]  I usually get funny looks when I take over the radio work. I'm used to it by now. It's
[03:59.640 --> 04:00.640]  been happening for a while.
[04:00.640 --> 04:04.400]  Well, that's funny because I had a front row ticket and the headlining band was Mike's
[04:04.400 --> 04:06.440]  favorite band, which is 311.
[04:07.040 --> 04:09.040]  Guess how much of 311 I stuck around for?
[04:09.040 --> 04:10.040]  Not a second.
[04:10.040 --> 04:13.040]  Not a second. So the band that I wanted to see.
[04:13.040 --> 04:14.040]  It's a good show.
[04:14.040 --> 04:16.040]  I probably did. I probably did. I'm not into 311.
[04:16.040 --> 04:20.200]  They set it off at Red Rocks. That's one of their favorite places to play and it's one
[04:20.200 --> 04:21.640]  of the best venues in the country.
[04:21.640 --> 04:26.520]  It is one of the best venues in the country. I'm a spoiled brat. I've probably seen 30
[04:26.520 --> 04:30.400]  Red Rocks concerts and that's no joke. Probably 15 of them were widespread panic.
[04:30.400 --> 04:35.240]  I was working that night and I caught a couple of clicks on Facebook and was like, oh, I
[04:35.240 --> 04:36.240]  wish I was there.
[04:36.240 --> 04:41.240]  And I chuckled because I remember that you would probably had just left the lot as those
[04:41.240 --> 04:42.440]  videos were being posted.
[04:42.440 --> 04:45.160]  Yes. So I get to see I get to see Morgan Heritage.
[04:45.160 --> 04:48.000]  That's most of the people that listen to the podcast frequently know that my favorite
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.080]  reggae band currently, it will change.
[04:50.080 --> 04:51.440]  It does just my taste change.
[04:51.440 --> 04:53.080]  I'll hear something that'll catch my attention.
[04:53.080 --> 04:56.760]  But Morgan Heritage has been my favorite reggae band for a couple of few months here,
[04:56.760 --> 04:58.520]  probably the past year or so.
[04:58.520 --> 04:59.760]  They were awesome.
[04:59.760 --> 05:02.320]  They played at 445.
[05:02.320 --> 05:03.680]  I got to catch most of their set.
[05:03.680 --> 05:05.200]  They sounded fantastic.
[05:05.200 --> 05:07.920]  They played a bunch of new shit that I didn't know, which was kind of cool.
[05:07.920 --> 05:11.720]  I kind of wanted to hear some familiar shit like, you know, you want to hear your favorites.
[05:11.720 --> 05:13.320]  But I also like seeing them.
[05:13.320 --> 05:15.240]  They do kind of a jam band thing.
[05:15.240 --> 05:18.240]  They start off with one song and they don't stop till about halfway through their set
[05:18.240 --> 05:20.600]  and they just segue song to song to song.
[05:20.600 --> 05:21.600]  So that was kind of neat.
[05:21.600 --> 05:23.520]  They kind of did a medley.
[05:23.520 --> 05:25.520]  What's your favorite song by them?
[05:25.520 --> 05:27.640]  It really depends on the mood.
[05:27.640 --> 05:29.640]  That's a good question.
[05:29.640 --> 05:33.800]  Right now, like not like this moment, but I guess in this realm of time, I'd probably
[05:33.800 --> 05:37.320]  throw on like Joss Seed is one of my favorite songs by them.
[05:37.320 --> 05:39.600]  But then Strictly Roots is also a good one.
[05:39.600 --> 05:42.760]  And then there's a bunch of like remixes that they do because they're a reggae artist.
[05:42.760 --> 05:46.640]  So it's always yeah, they'll put out a single all the time.
[05:46.640 --> 05:49.040]  But Strictly Roots is a great one.
[05:49.040 --> 05:50.040]  So I got to see them.
[05:50.040 --> 05:54.440]  They ended and I was in the front row and I looked back toward the sound booth just
[05:54.440 --> 05:57.480]  looking into the crowd and I see one of the band members hanging out and I was like, oh,
[05:57.480 --> 05:58.480]  he's over there.
[05:58.480 --> 06:00.400]  I was like, I'm not going to go bug him, but he's right there.
[06:00.400 --> 06:04.800]  And I turned around and his brother, Peter Morgan, was walking right past me.
[06:04.800 --> 06:07.360]  And Peter Morgan is probably my favorite reggae singer.
[06:07.360 --> 06:10.280]  If I could sound like anybody, if I could sing like a reggae artist and probably be
[06:10.280 --> 06:11.280]  Peter Morgan.
[06:11.280 --> 06:13.800]  I know that sounds really weird because he's got a high pitch kind of voice.
[06:13.800 --> 06:16.560]  He's kind of squeaky, but that you can fucking sing.
[06:16.560 --> 06:20.600]  And if I want to, if I could sound like anybody, probably be him, him or Richie Spice.
[06:20.600 --> 06:22.960]  But that's just the kind of reggae voice I wish I had.
[06:22.960 --> 06:24.280]  I know I don't, but it's cool.
[06:24.280 --> 06:25.560]  But that dude walked right past me.
[06:25.560 --> 06:28.400]  So I just put my hand on his shoulder and that dude is beefy, bro.
[06:28.400 --> 06:30.160]  Like, you know, when he touched some people, they kind of move.
[06:30.920 --> 06:32.640]  He is one stout fucking Jamaican.
[06:32.640 --> 06:35.120]  But I put my hand on his shoulder and I was like, bro, thank you.
[06:35.120 --> 06:37.880]  And he just turned around and looked me straight in my eyes and he stood up his right hand
[06:37.880 --> 06:39.520]  and he shook my hand and he said, respect.
[06:39.520 --> 06:42.280]  And then he kept on walking because he didn't want to get mobbed.
[06:42.280 --> 06:44.720]  You know, if I would have stood there for three seconds, he would have got crowded.
[06:44.720 --> 06:45.960]  So he just kept on moving.
[06:45.960 --> 06:46.960]  So that was cool.
[06:46.960 --> 06:50.920]  I got to meet pretty much my favorite reggae singer at Reggae on the Rocks.
[06:50.920 --> 06:51.920]  That was awesome.
[06:51.920 --> 06:55.440]  So he walked by, uh, time went on and then Steel Pulse came on.
[06:55.440 --> 06:58.160]  Steel Pulse might be my number two favorite reggae artist.
[06:58.160 --> 06:59.160]  So it was great seeing them.
[06:59.160 --> 07:05.320]  I'm hitting a joint, you guys.
[07:05.320 --> 07:09.060]  Steel Pulse was great, but they were a little slow.
[07:09.060 --> 07:10.360]  Everything just seemed a touch slow.
[07:10.360 --> 07:11.800]  They're getting fucking old.
[07:11.800 --> 07:14.840]  Like all the dreadlocks are super gray in Steel Pulse.
[07:14.840 --> 07:15.840]  Those dreads are getting gray.
[07:15.840 --> 07:17.080]  They're really long, but they're getting gray.
[07:17.080 --> 07:21.400]  So shout out to my anonymous friend who got me up front row there at Reggae on the Rocks.
[07:21.400 --> 07:22.400]  I truly do appreciate that.
[07:22.400 --> 07:23.400]  That was a good fucking time.
[07:23.400 --> 07:24.400]  I'll never forget it.
[07:24.400 --> 07:25.400]  Uh, thank you.
[07:25.400 --> 07:27.560]  Uh, so Reggae on the Rocks.
[07:27.960 --> 07:29.200]  Oh, I got to keep going.
[07:29.200 --> 07:31.320]  The band after that was Iration.
[07:31.320 --> 07:35.640]  I listened to about a song and a half and then I was like, let's get the fuck out of
[07:35.640 --> 07:36.640]  here.
[07:36.640 --> 07:37.640]  And we left.
[07:37.640 --> 07:38.640]  Iration was not entertaining me one bit.
[07:38.640 --> 07:39.640]  I didn't like the sound.
[07:39.640 --> 07:41.760]  If you like Iration, I apologize.
[07:41.760 --> 07:46.960]  I like roots reggae, but Iration was not doing it for me that night.
[07:46.960 --> 07:49.160]  So I left and I drove to the Secret Sash.
[07:49.160 --> 07:50.160]  Bum, bum, bum.
[07:50.160 --> 07:51.160]  What?
[07:51.160 --> 07:54.600]  Shout out to my buddy Adam Mill for hosting the Secret Sash.
[07:54.600 --> 07:56.160]  Adam Mill was in a really good mood.
[07:56.160 --> 07:57.280]  It was a really great time.
[07:58.000 --> 08:00.120]  I got to meet Adam's wife for the first time.
[08:00.120 --> 08:01.120]  She follows me on Facebook.
[08:01.120 --> 08:03.680]  We follow each other on all the social media, so it's cool to finally shake her hand and
[08:03.680 --> 08:04.680]  give her a hug.
[08:04.680 --> 08:06.040]  Shout out to Adam's wife.
[08:06.040 --> 08:08.440]  I bumped into Lindsey there.
[08:08.440 --> 08:09.840]  I ran into the Dab and Granny.
[08:09.840 --> 08:11.440]  I saw Bobo Blaster Co. there.
[08:11.440 --> 08:13.120]  I saw Brett for a brief moment.
[08:13.120 --> 08:14.120]  I saw the Grammy Gatsby.
[08:14.120 --> 08:15.120]  It was a great event.
[08:15.120 --> 08:19.640]  You guys, if you're ever able to go to a Secret Sash in Denver, Colorado, make sure you get
[08:19.640 --> 08:20.640]  on the list.
[08:20.640 --> 08:21.640]  Make sure you go do it.
[08:21.640 --> 08:23.200]  Come take some dabs with Lindsey, myself, the Dab and Granny.
[08:23.200 --> 08:24.200]  Yeah.
[08:24.200 --> 08:25.200]  It's a good ass time.
[08:25.200 --> 08:26.720]  Shout out to Max for that big ass dab you gave me.
[08:27.160 --> 08:28.160]  That was delicious.
[08:28.160 --> 08:32.640]  Shout out to Max for every time that we see him and every time I see him.
[08:32.640 --> 08:33.640]  He is so...
[08:33.640 --> 08:34.640]  Take this dab.
[08:34.640 --> 08:35.640]  Here's some bacon.
[08:35.640 --> 08:36.640]  Here's some something.
[08:36.640 --> 08:37.640]  I'm always like...
[08:37.640 --> 08:38.640]  Medicated bacon.
[08:38.640 --> 08:39.640]  He makes medicated bacon.
[08:39.640 --> 08:40.640]  Yes.
[08:40.640 --> 08:41.640]  Medicated bacon.
[08:41.640 --> 08:44.480]  And I do see people grubbing it at the event and they look satisfied, bro.
[08:44.480 --> 08:45.480]  He gives me some...
[08:45.480 --> 08:46.480]  Oh, go ahead.
[08:46.480 --> 08:47.480]  How would you medicate bacon?
[08:47.480 --> 08:48.480]  I'm in it.
[08:48.480 --> 08:51.880]  Well, I mean, I can't speak.
[08:51.880 --> 08:54.000]  I think his is in the crust.
[08:54.000 --> 08:55.000]  It's a sugar glaze, isn't it?
[08:55.000 --> 08:56.000]  I think, yeah.
[08:56.280 --> 08:57.280]  It's like a cinnamon.
[08:57.280 --> 08:59.560]  I mean, I could be wrong on that, really.
[08:59.560 --> 09:00.560]  So don't quote me.
[09:00.560 --> 09:01.560]  I've never eaten it because I'm a vegetarian.
[09:01.560 --> 09:02.560]  I wouldn't have to eat it.
[09:02.560 --> 09:03.560]  I'm bacon.
[09:03.560 --> 09:04.560]  Yeah.
[09:04.560 --> 09:05.560]  Yeah.
[09:05.560 --> 09:06.560]  I would assume you have to like...
[09:06.560 --> 09:10.400]  Because, I mean, cooking it in the oil wouldn't do enough because you wouldn't be able to
[09:10.400 --> 09:11.400]  tell the dosage.
[09:11.400 --> 09:12.400]  Right.
[09:12.400 --> 09:13.400]  It's real crispy and it's coated in something.
[09:13.400 --> 09:17.960]  Because he handed me some and gave it to me, but I just gave it to Bobo Blastrico because
[09:17.960 --> 09:18.960]  I don't eat bacon.
[09:18.960 --> 09:22.560]  When I told him that I'm a vegetarian, he kind of looked at me and he felt bad that
[09:22.560 --> 09:24.040]  he had been offering me bacon.
[09:24.080 --> 09:26.080]  He felt like legitimately guilty.
[09:26.080 --> 09:27.080]  Like, fuck, I'm sorry, man.
[09:27.080 --> 09:28.080]  No.
[09:28.080 --> 09:29.080]  And I was like, no, it's cool, man.
[09:29.080 --> 09:30.720]  He goes, here, here, I got this though.
[09:30.720 --> 09:32.720]  And he gave me a big ass dab.
[09:32.720 --> 09:34.800]  Like a really, like a manly size dab.
[09:34.800 --> 09:37.520]  And when I told him I took it all in one chunk, I'm good on that little one, but thank you
[09:37.520 --> 09:38.520]  to thank you.
[09:38.520 --> 09:39.520]  I'm good.
[09:39.520 --> 09:40.520]  What did we just smoke?
[09:40.520 --> 09:41.520]  That was...
[09:41.520 --> 09:43.680]  Hold on, let me think.
[09:43.680 --> 09:44.680]  Space cream.
[09:44.680 --> 09:45.680]  Space cream.
[09:45.680 --> 09:46.680]  Okay.
[09:46.680 --> 09:48.520]  That had a good flavor, a good smooth burn, nice white ashes.
[09:48.520 --> 09:49.600]  I like that packaging.
[09:49.600 --> 09:51.920]  Can you tell me about that company and that packaging?
[09:51.920 --> 09:55.560]  This is from Altitude Organic Medicine in the Springs.
[09:55.560 --> 09:59.960]  Well, shout out to our friends at Altitude.
[09:59.960 --> 10:01.600]  This is pretty convenient for me.
[10:01.600 --> 10:05.040]  I'm kind of lazy when it gets to the rolling joints sometimes.
[10:05.040 --> 10:08.520]  So this dude showed up with two packages of pre-rolled joints.
[10:08.520 --> 10:09.520]  The weed was good.
[10:09.520 --> 10:10.520]  Yeah.
[10:10.520 --> 10:11.520]  Yeah.
[10:11.520 --> 10:12.520]  It tastes good.
[10:12.520 --> 10:13.520]  I got stung from it.
[10:13.520 --> 10:14.520]  I'm a little leery about some places where I buy pre-rolls.
[10:14.520 --> 10:15.520]  You know what I mean?
[10:15.520 --> 10:16.520]  Oh yeah.
[10:16.520 --> 10:17.520]  Because they're kind of suspect, but these guys, they come through really well.
[10:17.520 --> 10:18.520]  Yeah.
[10:18.520 --> 10:19.520]  One of their managers is a very good friend of mine and I trust that place because of
[10:19.520 --> 10:20.520]  her.
[10:20.520 --> 10:21.520]  So, because I know she wouldn't represent a place that wasn't worth representing.
[10:21.520 --> 10:22.520]  She's got too big of a heart.
[10:22.520 --> 10:23.520]  So shout out to Altitude.
[10:23.520 --> 10:24.520]  That's really cool.
[10:24.520 --> 10:25.520]  It's great packaging.
[10:25.520 --> 10:26.520]  This dude showed up with packages of pre-rolled joints of quality joints.
[10:26.520 --> 10:27.520]  Oh yeah, for sure.
[10:27.520 --> 10:28.520]  That, you know, I don't know why a lot of more companies aren't pre-packaging.
[10:28.520 --> 10:29.520]  I like that it says Sativa and Indica on the top.
[10:29.520 --> 10:30.520]  That's rad.
[10:30.520 --> 10:31.520]  Cool.
[10:31.520 --> 10:32.520]  Great packaging.
[10:32.520 --> 10:33.520]  Yeah.
[10:33.520 --> 10:34.520]  I like that.
[10:34.520 --> 10:35.520]  I like that.
[10:35.520 --> 10:36.520]  I like that.
[10:36.520 --> 10:37.520]  I like that.
[10:37.520 --> 10:38.520]  I like that.
[10:38.520 --> 10:39.520]  I like that.
[10:39.520 --> 10:40.520]  I like that.
[10:40.520 --> 10:41.520]  I like that.
[10:41.520 --> 10:42.520]  I like that.
[10:43.260 --> 10:45.940]  I like that it says Sativa and Indica on the top.
[10:45.940 --> 10:46.940]  That's rad.
[10:46.940 --> 10:47.940]  Cool.
[10:47.940 --> 10:48.940]  Great packaging.
[10:48.940 --> 10:49.940]  Good idea, you guys over at Altitude.
[10:49.940 --> 10:50.940]  I like that.
[10:50.940 --> 10:53.660]  The first place I saw that was a place called Pride in Medicine in Denver, but they fell
[10:53.660 --> 10:54.900]  off when all the new rules came.
[10:54.900 --> 10:55.900]  Yeah.
[10:55.900 --> 10:56.900]  Yeah.
[10:56.900 --> 11:01.300]  A couple of different places doing something similar, and I like the way that this project
[11:01.300 --> 11:02.420]  turned out, those are slick.
[11:02.420 --> 11:03.900]  It's a good product too.
[11:03.900 --> 11:06.180]  You know, the Willie Nelson strand, I've got a chance.
[11:06.180 --> 11:10.360]  chance I get a chance to try just about every product out
[11:10.360 --> 11:13.800]  there on the market being able to travel the whole state. Oh,
[11:13.800 --> 11:19.380]  yeah. I'm a sucker for name brand and marijuana. You know,
[11:19.380 --> 11:24.240]  I've tried to Snoop Dogg, but Willie, I gotta give a shout
[11:24.240 --> 11:28.420]  out to him. He's the his model. He actually grows his weed in
[11:28.420 --> 11:32.540]  house. You know, unlike like Snoop, he just come to right
[11:32.860 --> 11:36.620]  puts his name on something name on the strand. He likes Willie
[11:36.620 --> 11:41.500]  actually. This is his company grew it and I went to Lucy Sky
[11:41.500 --> 11:47.340]  in Denver and they had a little room set up had guitars albums
[11:47.340 --> 11:52.700]  where he signed all kinds of merch and then is his joint
[11:52.700 --> 11:55.540]  packaging and is that a recreational or a medical place
[11:55.540 --> 11:58.900]  that's both drinking man. Okay. So anybody that's coming from
[11:58.900 --> 12:00.860]  out of state make sure you check out what's it called again
[12:00.940 --> 12:05.740]  Willie's Reserve. The dispensary Lucy Sky Lucy Sky and
[12:05.740 --> 12:07.300]  you can check out Willie's Reserve there and it's a
[12:07.300 --> 12:09.780]  dispensary where they got some Willie Nelson memorabilia and
[12:09.780 --> 12:12.340]  merchandise. That's kind of cool. I'm gonna check that out
[12:12.340 --> 12:16.500]  myself. Oh, that's kind of for show. But yeah, the the get is
[12:16.500 --> 12:22.900]  the is the the wood. Okay, he's got he's got concentrates and
[12:22.900 --> 12:26.660]  edibles too. I haven't tried those. I just tried a couple of
[12:26.660 --> 12:29.700]  pre rolled joints. I'm just seeing the packaging the
[12:29.700 --> 12:32.740]  patching packaging looked intense. Yeah, it is pretty
[12:32.740 --> 12:36.180]  intense. All the new packaging is intense. It's a tube and then
[12:36.180 --> 12:39.220]  you pull it out and then it's got another pre roll tube in
[12:39.220 --> 12:43.580]  there and it's like a Russian doll trying to buy cannabis now.
[12:43.580 --> 12:48.540]  Exactly. Exactly. I don't have a that's all right. Lindsay, what
[12:48.540 --> 12:50.780]  did you just bust out? You just threw some some snacks here on
[12:50.780 --> 12:54.620]  the table. What do you got for us? Oh, this is the
[12:54.620 --> 12:59.340]  Incredibles monkey bar. Oh, shit. The medical dose. The
[12:59.340 --> 13:02.460]  medical dose. So these are 20 each square is 20 milligrams.
[13:02.460 --> 13:05.980]  I'm gonna move these right out of my reach. I appreciate you.
[13:06.020 --> 13:09.060]  I love you more than Terps. But I haven't eaten edibles since my
[13:09.060 --> 13:11.580]  experience at the secret session. And I keep trying. I
[13:11.580 --> 13:14.020]  know. I know. And I'm I'm kind of trying. I'm trying to see
[13:14.020 --> 13:17.820]  how long I can go. dosage every time. I know. I'm it's it's
[13:17.860 --> 13:19.980]  once I get on a streak. I'm really weird. And I like to stay
[13:19.980 --> 13:22.740]  on a streak. I don't I'm and I'm on a streak. I got five
[13:22.780 --> 13:23.700]  milligrams in the car.
[13:26.700 --> 13:28.900]  Yeah, well, whenever I pick a streak, whatever I'm doing, I'm
[13:28.900 --> 13:31.380]  really stubborn. So if I commit to something that I just like
[13:31.420 --> 13:33.860]  once I've made it like a week or two, and I've broken the desire
[13:33.860 --> 13:36.300]  or whatever, then I'm like, it's easy. Let's just see how long I
[13:36.300 --> 13:39.180]  can go on whatever I'm doing here. Whether it's not eating
[13:39.180 --> 13:41.500]  meat, which has been 20 something years now or not
[13:41.500 --> 13:44.380]  brushing my hair, which has been almost 12 years. Or you know,
[13:44.380 --> 13:49.220]  just like that. I don't miss either one of those. I don't
[13:49.220 --> 13:52.700]  miss either one of the brushing. Yeah, he's a bald guy. He's a
[13:52.700 --> 13:55.460]  he's got his head shaved nice and close here. So you get
[13:55.460 --> 13:57.820]  almost you could almost brush your beard. Yeah, and my back
[13:57.820 --> 13:58.100]  hair.
[14:04.780 --> 14:06.380]  I like this guy, you're gonna be on the show more often.
[14:07.460 --> 14:09.900]  Just to make your no edible streak funny. I haven't showed
[14:09.900 --> 14:12.060]  up with edibles this time. I've got a bunch of high end
[14:12.060 --> 14:14.500]  chocolates that we just got into the shop that I just felt like
[14:14.500 --> 14:17.460]  trying so I they come in a sample pack. So I brought the
[14:17.460 --> 14:18.700]  sample for us to play with.
[14:18.820 --> 14:21.220]  I had the person that got me those Reggie on the rocks
[14:21.220 --> 14:23.620]  tickets that that might be her favorite edible that you brought
[14:23.620 --> 14:26.300]  there the term a suit one there I had a bunch of people asked me
[14:26.300 --> 14:29.780]  for and that's the one I plan on trying but you know how I act
[14:29.780 --> 14:33.900]  for lemon G dabs. That's how she gets for those terrorists who
[14:33.900 --> 14:37.060]  they're edibles. The packaging is impressive as shit. They're
[14:37.060 --> 14:39.940]  totally compliant with the new rules too, which I like is a
[14:39.940 --> 14:42.660]  lot of stuff that I've even that I'm getting samples of right now
[14:42.660 --> 14:46.660]  isn't packaging. It's Yeah, I think when they rolled out, I
[14:46.660 --> 14:49.860]  think they knew that that was coming. And they just, they just
[14:49.860 --> 14:54.500]  planned for it with a get Yeah. And I mean, I haven't tried one
[14:54.500 --> 14:57.380]  yet. But so far packaging and presentations at home run.
[14:57.460 --> 14:59.860]  Remember back in the day when we had a dispensary and the
[14:59.860 --> 15:02.260]  packaging was basically one of these Ziploc bags with the
[15:02.260 --> 15:06.340]  product name handwritten on it. Basically, literally places
[15:06.340 --> 15:12.580]  still that sell weed in baggies. Oh, that's funny. Yeah, we would
[15:12.580 --> 15:16.860]  get the owners owner, one of the owners were walking in with a
[15:16.860 --> 15:20.300]  laundry or not, you know, like the sweater storage bin, the big
[15:20.300 --> 15:24.060]  plastic bin for like under the bed was one of those Tupperware
[15:24.060 --> 15:25.900]  things. I mean, the thing that a lot of people make it easy
[15:25.900 --> 15:31.580]  cloner out of that thing. And it would be full of like slices of
[15:31.580 --> 15:35.020]  banana bread individually wrapped in Ziploc bags with just
[15:35.020 --> 15:38.300]  a piece of scotch tape taping the flap down so it fit taught.
[15:38.940 --> 15:43.820]  And that was what went onto our shelf. Like, yeah, it was exactly
[15:43.820 --> 15:45.700]  that. And you know where they stayed when we closed at the end
[15:45.700 --> 15:48.660]  of the night, right? Right there on that shelf. Nothing got put
[15:48.660 --> 15:51.620]  away. We're never there longer than like three or four. Like
[15:51.660 --> 15:55.220]  part of me is glad like we've advanced to where we are now
[15:55.220 --> 15:57.940]  because it's a good thing that the health department is
[15:57.940 --> 16:03.860]  overseeing edible production. But I do I never pictured something
[16:03.860 --> 16:07.460]  like the product I'm holding in my hand. I mean, even three years
[16:07.460 --> 16:10.580]  ago, let alone five or seven. That's like something that you
[16:10.580 --> 16:14.100]  would get from a really fine chocolate company through the
[16:14.100 --> 16:17.140]  mail or something like I figured. I've heard a rumor
[16:17.140 --> 16:21.300]  about the company that they got some exotic friendship but that
[16:21.300 --> 16:26.100]  you know, that that's probably just somebody making it up. But
[16:26.420 --> 16:29.780]  who knows maybe it's definitely they've definitely got a high
[16:29.780 --> 16:32.260]  end chocolate tier working for them. These are impressive as
[16:32.260 --> 16:36.900]  shit. I've paid a lot of money to give these to girlfriends
[16:36.900 --> 16:41.860]  throughout my life. Just non medicated. I've paid the same
[16:41.860 --> 16:45.140]  amount for these that I paid for unmedicated chocolates more
[16:45.140 --> 16:47.700]  than one holiday. So since we're hyping them up, let's give
[16:47.700 --> 16:49.220]  let's give them a quick shout out. They didn't pay for any
[16:49.220 --> 16:51.140]  advertising, but they seem to be the talk of the show for a
[16:51.140 --> 16:55.620]  couple of seconds here. Coda signature truffles signature
[16:55.620 --> 16:58.100]  truffles. They're packaged very nicely. They come in a black
[16:58.100 --> 17:01.300]  box. It looks like a condom package. Three different flip
[17:01.380 --> 17:03.540]  doesn't it looks like a fancy condom box is what it makes me
[17:03.540 --> 17:07.860]  think. I've had more than one person described it as that. So
[17:07.940 --> 17:11.940]  it's the logo. It's not the box. It's the logo. The logo is
[17:11.940 --> 17:18.340]  kind of absolutely rubberish. It makes a circle and it Yeah,
[17:18.340 --> 17:21.380]  absolutely. It does. I'm not gonna I'm not gonna get it. But
[17:21.540 --> 17:24.980]  I had heard about these long before I actually got them. I
[17:24.980 --> 17:27.940]  got to see them in person and when they were at the shop
[17:27.940 --> 17:29.140]  today, I had to grab a couple.
[17:32.260 --> 17:36.100]  As far as I mean, one day I don't know. I think they're the
[17:36.180 --> 17:39.700]  tastiest. Probably one I've tried on the market. Anyway, I
[17:39.700 --> 17:42.500]  haven't tried them out. Lindsay just threw a medium sized dab
[17:42.500 --> 17:44.340]  at me. I'm gonna have to take this one. So
[17:45.780 --> 17:48.260]  just slows down for a second. Just know that we're getting
[17:48.260 --> 17:52.020]  higher for you. There are six pieces for you guys. Do you
[17:52.020 --> 17:54.980]  guys dive in if you want one? The flavors are kind of listed
[17:54.980 --> 17:58.900]  on the box here. There's there's six of them in there. How many
[17:58.900 --> 18:02.260]  milligrams is each piece? Each piece is 10 milligrams. Okay,
[18:02.260 --> 18:05.220]  it's per box. So it's only 60. So you guys can really dive in
[18:05.220 --> 18:09.060]  and try a couple. All right. No, no, I brought you the baby
[18:09.060 --> 18:12.740]  step. I mean, the starter step bro. Keeping my streak. I'm just
[18:12.740 --> 18:17.940]  gonna infuse your lunch. Keep thinking that until I infuse
[18:17.940 --> 18:21.460]  your lunch one day. infuse it with some acid or some some THC.
[18:22.020 --> 18:24.420]  How much does that package cost if you're not an employee at the
[18:24.420 --> 18:28.020]  dispensary? I honestly don't know. What a snobby asshole. Are
[18:28.020 --> 18:32.180]  you? No surprise. I've only got me on the spot. It's like the
[18:32.260 --> 18:35.140]  one item on myself. I don't know. There's that one.
[18:35.140 --> 18:36.500]  Yeah, sure. One.
[18:38.340 --> 18:41.700]  Wish me dicks. Do you have a price? Right now? This is
[18:41.700 --> 18:45.540]  delicious. You have a price range? It's about 23. Okay,
[18:45.540 --> 18:47.940]  worth it. Worth it. Then that's probably worth 100% worth it.
[18:47.940 --> 18:49.860]  Yeah. If you were a dude and you were in trouble and your
[18:49.860 --> 18:51.620]  girlfriend's a pothead and you brought those home to your to
[18:51.620 --> 18:55.460]  your girlfriend, you'd probably be fixed. Okay, she might think
[18:55.460 --> 18:58.420]  you've done something wrong. Something fancy. That's what you
[18:58.420 --> 19:00.500]  gotta this way. You gotta save it till you already done fucked
[19:00.500 --> 19:02.420]  up. Just wait till she already knows when you're in the dog
[19:02.420 --> 19:04.580]  house already and then show up with those. Yeah, for a regular
[19:04.580 --> 19:08.180]  gift bringer. This is uh, I screwed up good. Don't call my
[19:08.180 --> 19:12.660]  mama. Calm down. Did your wife call your mom when you fuck up?
[19:12.660 --> 19:18.100]  No, but like Jeff was really concerned for you. My mom called
[19:18.100 --> 19:20.820]  my wife, which it's weird that we're talking about that now on
[19:20.820 --> 19:22.980]  the show, but these are delicious.
[19:24.820 --> 19:28.100]  Wait to switch just so you know, girls do do that. They
[19:28.180 --> 19:32.260]  call their significant other's mother. I mean like in thirties
[19:32.260 --> 19:35.860]  and forties to tattle and like get them in trouble just so you
[19:35.860 --> 19:38.420]  know, my mom would just laugh and hang up on you. I know, I
[19:38.420 --> 19:47.780]  know. Click. Tell me about it. Sorry mama. All right. So you
[19:47.780 --> 19:49.700]  guys, we did come together for an actual podcast. We're not
[19:49.700 --> 19:51.620]  gonna talk about dabs and chocolates and all that shit
[19:51.620 --> 19:54.660]  for this whole show. We just brought fun snacks and got kind
[19:54.660 --> 19:57.940]  of carried away. Pretty much. Mike called me semi early
[19:57.940 --> 19:59.860]  today for Mike and I, it might've been early for most of
[19:59.860 --> 20:04.340]  you folks. It was probably well into your day. I was just
[20:04.340 --> 20:06.740]  thinking to myself, I bet you this conversation happened at
[20:06.740 --> 20:10.020]  one and at this point, it still had an am attached to it. There
[20:10.020 --> 20:14.180]  was an am involved, but Mike sent me a message and he's like,
[20:14.180 --> 20:17.220]  Hey, uh, this is what's up. This reporter is looking for
[20:17.220 --> 20:19.860]  somebody to talk to because there's this new story going on
[20:20.500 --> 20:23.380]  and he's like, would you like to speak? And I was like, nope.
[20:23.380 --> 20:25.540]  And about two seconds later, my phone blew up with a whole
[20:25.540 --> 20:27.540]  bunch of other people asking me, would you like to speak for
[20:27.540 --> 20:29.940]  us? Would you like to speak for us? Cause I'm well spoken. I
[20:29.940 --> 20:31.700]  guess I'm well known amongst the cannabis community and they
[20:31.700 --> 20:33.300]  felt that I'd be a good representative. So shout out to
[20:33.300 --> 20:35.460]  all the people that messaged me and wanted me to contact this
[20:35.460 --> 20:38.900]  reporter for you. That's cool. I passed the baton over to our
[20:38.900 --> 20:42.100]  buddy Mike, because I don't want to be on the news talking
[20:42.100 --> 20:45.300]  about that. I grow cannabis. I just don't want to do that. So
[20:45.300 --> 20:47.700]  I let Mike do it. And Mike's well-spoken and eloquent.
[20:48.420 --> 20:52.580]  There's a reason, um, caregivers don't do interviews.
[20:52.580 --> 20:54.660]  Yeah. It's a really good reason. I don't know.
[20:54.660 --> 20:55.700]  The Barkowitz effect.
[20:55.700 --> 20:58.740]  I didn't want to name it on the show, but yeah, it's legitimately
[20:58.740 --> 21:01.540]  the Barkowitz effect. The one and only caregiver in Colorado
[21:01.540 --> 21:05.300]  to really do an interview paid for it severely. Yeah. It's
[21:05.300 --> 21:09.860]  still paying for it in many very real ways. Um, and it's been a
[21:09.860 --> 21:15.060]  lot of years in, uh, in Pueblo. That means that we had no
[21:15.060 --> 21:19.540]  caregiver advocates down here and sort of, um, for lack of a
[21:19.540 --> 21:23.060]  better candidate that became me a long time ago. Thank you.
[21:23.620 --> 21:26.580]  Uh, you're welcome. It's a fight that I care about. Um,
[21:26.580 --> 21:29.860]  caregivers have been part of Colorado for more than a decade.
[21:30.660 --> 21:34.820]  Um, we've never been part of the problem. Um, and I say we in
[21:34.820 --> 21:37.300]  a very general term because I am not a caregiver, but, uh,
[21:38.020 --> 21:40.660]  they're very much under attack again right now in Colorado
[21:40.660 --> 21:44.580]  from a number of different angles. Um, they're going after
[21:44.580 --> 21:47.540]  the doctors right now and looking at plant counts there.
[21:47.540 --> 21:50.820]  Every County is restricting the number of plants you can grow
[21:50.900 --> 21:55.060]  in a home. Um, or looking to limit the size and scope of
[21:55.060 --> 21:58.340]  your garden for, uh, in one way or another, if it's not by
[21:58.340 --> 22:02.580]  plant count directly. Um, it's a rough time. I predicted a
[22:02.580 --> 22:04.980]  couple of years back that caregiving wouldn't be a thing
[22:04.980 --> 22:08.180]  by 2020. But we saw this happen in Springs less than a year ago.
[22:08.180 --> 22:10.260]  And now that's basically the same rules are trying to
[22:10.260 --> 22:13.300]  implement that they did in Springs are trying to do here.
[22:13.300 --> 22:15.540]  It's, uh, it's even more than that. They've already done it
[22:15.540 --> 22:19.300]  here. Um, and what they're, uh, what the, what's going on right
[22:19.300 --> 22:22.740]  now is, uh, our board of County commissioners is talking about
[22:22.740 --> 22:25.940]  putting a question on the vote this November on the ballot
[22:26.660 --> 22:31.140]  that says, uh, should we go to the state and continue to lobby
[22:31.140 --> 22:38.580]  for a statewide cap of 18 plants per house? Um, and so even,
[22:38.580 --> 22:41.540]  even if you have a medical recommendation from your doctor
[22:41.540 --> 22:47.380]  to grow an increased plant count of say 60 plants, then fuck
[22:47.380 --> 22:49.940]  your medical card, fuck your needs, fuck your condition.
[22:49.940 --> 22:53.540]  Well, yes, you're limited by this new rule. This, the, the
[22:53.540 --> 22:56.420]  new rules that they're talking about wouldn't affect the card
[22:56.420 --> 22:59.780]  that you get written. It would just affect your ability to
[22:59.780 --> 23:03.860]  grow on that card. Okay. You'd be limited, um, to that number
[23:03.860 --> 23:08.740]  of plants, unless you had a specific type of property, um,
[23:08.740 --> 23:11.300]  which I haven't seen defined anywhere. It's just not in a
[23:11.300 --> 23:14.100]  house or a residence. And because of what caregivers are
[23:14.100 --> 23:17.060]  and what the other rules around caregiving are in Colorado,
[23:17.060 --> 23:19.700]  that means you can't be a caregiver and have more than 18
[23:19.700 --> 23:22.820]  plants period. Um, because if you're a caregiver, you can't
[23:22.820 --> 23:25.300]  have a storefront or a building or anything like that. You have
[23:25.300 --> 23:29.460]  to do it out of your home. Um, so essentially these new rules
[23:29.460 --> 23:32.580]  statewide means no more caregivers, um, and your
[23:32.580 --> 23:35.300]  extended plant count card could still exist. And you'd just be
[23:35.300 --> 23:38.260]  excited, assigning that extended plant count to your dispensary.
[23:39.380 --> 23:41.460]  Which feels like is what they're trying to do with most
[23:41.460 --> 23:43.540]  of the patients. They're trying to take away the caregiver and
[23:43.540 --> 23:45.780]  send it all to a dispensary so they can make some tax money
[23:45.780 --> 23:48.500]  off of it and not worry about what's actually needing to be
[23:48.500 --> 23:52.100]  taken care of. That's been the goal statewide for a long time.
[23:52.100 --> 23:55.940]  Caregivers have been the scapegoat, um, for all
[23:55.940 --> 23:59.540]  continued black market activity in Colorado for the last eight
[23:59.540 --> 24:03.460]  years. Um, anytime a homegrown gets busted, they're like, oh
[24:03.460 --> 24:07.460]  my God, these medical rules are so confusing. And I go back and
[24:07.460 --> 24:10.740]  reread the article in the paper and it's, there was no
[24:10.740 --> 24:14.900]  paperwork. Uh, it wasn't a caregiver that was breaking the
[24:14.980 --> 24:18.100]  rules or manipulating the rules or hiding under the rules. It
[24:18.100 --> 24:20.820]  was just a black market grower that's been here for forever
[24:21.380 --> 24:24.500]  doing what they've always done. Uh, the only thing that's
[24:24.500 --> 24:27.780]  different is that caregivers also exist in the same state.
[24:28.500 --> 24:32.660]  Um, but caregivers are the public face of home growing. And
[24:32.660 --> 24:37.380]  so they take all that heat. Um, at the same time, the state has
[24:37.380 --> 24:41.620]  gotten a taste of recreational taxes and they've gotten a real
[24:41.700 --> 24:46.500]  look at the sales totals by volume in the med market, still
[24:46.500 --> 24:51.220]  eating up half of what Colorado period is selling. Um, and they
[24:51.220 --> 24:55.700]  would love to tax that at the higher rate. So medical is kind
[24:55.700 --> 24:59.780]  of under attack under all fronts right now. Um, which is why I've
[24:59.780 --> 25:02.100]  been telling people to register to vote for eight months.
[25:04.500 --> 25:07.060]  Something that, uh, you can clear up for a lot of Colorado
[25:07.060 --> 25:10.580]  folks. People in Colorado have this thing that they think that
[25:10.580 --> 25:12.900]  since as an adult, they're allowed to grow six plants. If
[25:12.900 --> 25:16.180]  they get their basic six plant plant medical marijuana card,
[25:16.180 --> 25:18.340]  are you allowed to grow your six plus your six? Or are you
[25:18.340 --> 25:21.220]  just limited at the original six? It depends on where you're
[25:21.220 --> 25:25.220]  living. That is confusing as shit. It really, really, really,
[25:25.220 --> 25:29.060]  really, okay. So here in Pueblo, um, it matters city to
[25:29.060 --> 25:33.460]  County. Um, the city doesn't care what your plant count is.
[25:33.460 --> 25:37.780]  Um, I worked incredibly hard for a very long time to make
[25:37.780 --> 25:41.540]  sure that the city of Pueblo did not implement a plant count
[25:41.540 --> 25:46.820]  limit. Um, just, um, we found sympathetic ears inside city
[25:46.820 --> 25:50.820]  government and myself and a caregiver here in town, um, who
[25:50.820 --> 25:53.700]  isn't willing to go on the news, but is willing to work with city
[25:53.700 --> 25:57.780]  government people, um, managed to get them to hear reason and
[25:57.780 --> 26:00.900]  not do a plant count limit. Um, so they did a square footage
[26:00.900 --> 26:04.500]  limit and require air filtration. Um, we couldn't get
[26:04.500 --> 26:07.540]  them to hear reason on a number of other rules they implemented
[26:08.100 --> 26:12.500]  that, uh, I don't support nearly as much. Um, but, uh, uh, in
[26:12.500 --> 26:16.340]  the County, they've already passed an 18 plant count limit,
[26:16.340 --> 26:20.420]  which means if you live in Pueblo County versus city, uh,
[26:20.420 --> 26:23.540]  you're limited to 18 plants period. If you live in a
[26:23.540 --> 26:26.900]  residential area, there are some exceptions to that. And
[26:26.900 --> 26:30.820]  you'll have to look up your specific zoning, um, your
[26:30.820 --> 26:34.260]  residents, and then what the specific rules are for that
[26:34.260 --> 26:37.380]  zoning designation before, uh, before I could give you a hard
[26:37.460 --> 26:41.380]  answer on that. So yeah, it's very complicated. You answered
[26:41.380 --> 26:43.700]  my question. Cause somebody came into the dispensary the other
[26:43.700 --> 26:48.900]  day and told me that Pueblo was an 18 count, um, County. And I
[26:48.900 --> 26:52.420]  was like, what are you talking about? I was like, no, it's not.
[26:52.420 --> 26:54.900]  And he was like, yeah, it is. He's like, look it up. And I was
[26:54.900 --> 26:59.780]  like, I'm not going to look it up. I'm going to call Mike. Um,
[26:59.780 --> 27:04.340]  I, uh, I remember that fight and there was not much public
[27:04.420 --> 27:08.100]  support against it. Um, caregivers are really busy
[27:08.100 --> 27:11.220]  people. The state put the squeeze on them several years
[27:11.220 --> 27:15.460]  ago, um, with a couple of statewide limitations that, um,
[27:15.460 --> 27:18.100]  mean in practice, caregivers don't have a lot of free time
[27:18.100 --> 27:22.420]  to lobby city councils. Um, and when they do, they tend to get
[27:22.420 --> 27:26.180]  treated pretty badly, um, because they're there for one
[27:26.180 --> 27:29.220]  specific issue. They don't have six months to learn how to play
[27:29.220 --> 27:32.100]  the insane game you're required to play to do things like that.
[27:32.900 --> 27:37.300]  Um, it's often unfortunate that the system works that way, but
[27:37.300 --> 27:41.780]  that's how it works. Um, and so caregivers have had a rough go
[27:41.780 --> 27:44.740]  of it in Colorado and it looks like one, maybe two more
[27:44.740 --> 27:48.020]  elections and, uh, they're going to be something that's in our
[27:48.020 --> 27:51.780]  history books. We need caregivers. So if you can really
[27:51.780 --> 27:53.940]  do, if you're a part of the vote, make sure that you, uh,
[27:53.940 --> 27:56.580]  wait for this to come up on the ballot and you do not allow them
[27:56.580 --> 28:01.460]  to limit our plant count to 18 plants. Um, just as an example,
[28:01.540 --> 28:04.180]  if you've got a four by four tray and you've got one light,
[28:04.900 --> 28:09.460]  it is very feasible. It makes a lot of sense to run 64 plants
[28:09.460 --> 28:11.780]  in that four by four tray. That sounds like a lot of plants,
[28:11.780 --> 28:15.060]  right? But here's how you do it. You cut 64 clones. As soon as
[28:15.060 --> 28:17.860]  they start popping fat roots, you put them in the four by four
[28:17.860 --> 28:20.420]  tray. You put a little capillary mat down for those roots to grow
[28:20.420 --> 28:23.940]  into. You do, it's like an ebb and flow system. You fill that
[28:23.940 --> 28:26.340]  tray. Then you drain that tray every hour, fill it, drain it,
[28:26.340 --> 28:28.900]  fill it, drain it. You got 64 little plants in there. You
[28:28.900 --> 28:31.380]  flower them in there about six inches tall. They finish off
[28:31.380 --> 28:34.180]  about 12 inches tall and you pull about six or seven grams
[28:34.180 --> 28:37.380]  per plant. That's a pound of weed, but you got 64 plants.
[28:37.380 --> 28:39.700]  You do the same thing with one plant or four plants under a
[28:39.700 --> 28:42.100]  seven gallon pot, just depending on how long you want to veg it.
[28:42.100 --> 28:45.460]  It takes a lot longer. It's way easier to pull that pound of
[28:45.460 --> 28:49.460]  cannabis for Mike's medicine with 64 tiny, tiny plants than
[28:49.460 --> 28:51.940]  it is with a whole bunch of big pots and bigger plants that you
[28:51.940 --> 28:54.660]  have to veg for longer time. So it makes a lot of sense. It's
[28:54.660 --> 28:58.100]  not like 64 plants is not like cartel numbers kicking out a
[28:58.260 --> 29:01.620]  bunch of weight. That's one pound. Just one example. I mean,
[29:01.620 --> 29:05.140]  people, when they see something like 99 plants is the state
[29:05.140 --> 29:09.300]  limit, they picture the plants they've seen in the newspaper
[29:09.300 --> 29:12.260]  that are the size of a Volkswagen bus. They picture
[29:12.260 --> 29:17.300]  99 of those suckers and they just don't realize that
[29:17.300 --> 29:20.420]  immediately the numbers cut in half because only half of those
[29:20.420 --> 29:23.700]  plants can be flowering. When you're talking about a
[29:23.700 --> 29:27.540]  caregiver with this growing 99 plants, it's often because
[29:27.540 --> 29:33.620]  they're caregivers for five patients, often five patients
[29:33.620 --> 29:38.580]  and then themselves. And each patient requires two or three
[29:38.580 --> 29:42.900]  strains. Each strain requires one or two moms. When you start
[29:42.900 --> 29:46.500]  dividing out over life cycles in two different rooms, all of a
[29:46.500 --> 29:51.540]  sudden you're struggling to stay under 99 and you're barely
[29:51.540 --> 29:54.660]  producing enough marijuana for just your patients. And if you
[29:54.660 --> 29:57.220]  want to run a seed pack to find something new, then you're
[29:57.220 --> 30:00.020]  really already over numbers. As soon as you pop those 10 and get
[30:00.020 --> 30:02.420]  them planted. I mean, it gets very complicated. And when your
[30:02.420 --> 30:08.420]  number is six, it's almost impossible. You're basically
[30:08.420 --> 30:14.260]  left with plant a seed, pray it's female. Maybe keep one and
[30:14.260 --> 30:18.260]  rotate five. I mean, it gets very complicated quickly and
[30:18.820 --> 30:23.780]  it's not productive and it doesn't do anything to combat
[30:23.780 --> 30:28.020]  the things that people that are writing these rules are hoping
[30:28.020 --> 30:30.660]  it will. It's not going to do anything to the illegal growers.
[30:31.540 --> 30:34.340]  It's not going to do anything to the smell of marijuana in
[30:34.340 --> 30:39.300]  neighborhoods from shitty gross with no carbon filters. It's
[30:39.300 --> 30:42.020]  just going to make life a lot harder for patients who rely on
[30:42.020 --> 30:44.740]  caregivers for medicine at a price they can afford. It's
[30:44.740 --> 30:47.300]  going to force them to go to a dispensary. It's going to force
[30:47.300 --> 30:50.820]  them to maybe find a ride. They don't have a ride. Maybe they
[30:50.820 --> 30:53.940]  don't have time. Maybe they don't have money because I know
[30:53.940 --> 30:57.460]  that what if you've got a caregiver, what you are
[30:57.460 --> 31:00.020]  reimbursing your caregiver compared to what you are paying
[31:00.020 --> 31:02.820]  at the dispensary is a huge, huge drastic difference.
[31:03.780 --> 31:05.460]  The difference is massive.
[31:06.260 --> 31:06.820]  Almost 50%.
[31:07.860 --> 31:13.140]  Yeah, the I mean, just the cost to the patient is 50% at least.
[31:13.140 --> 31:15.780]  So here's here's something that we should think about. Mike,
[31:15.780 --> 31:18.580]  I've been your caregiver for how long now since probably 2010
[31:18.580 --> 31:21.220]  ish, give or take so six or seven years.
[31:22.900 --> 31:26.100]  I know your cannabis needs very well. I like to think I've
[31:26.100 --> 31:28.740]  watched you evolve into a little dabber lately. It's been kind of
[31:28.740 --> 31:32.420]  neat to see. It's a time saver. I can name straight. I know which
[31:32.420 --> 31:34.740]  strains you like. I know if I walked into my garden, I'd be
[31:34.740 --> 31:36.820]  like, I got to throw a couple of these into the room for Mike
[31:36.820 --> 31:39.140]  because he's going to need this in about 60 days. I got to get
[31:39.140 --> 31:42.180]  this ready for him. Yep. Lindsey's a bud tender. She's a
[31:42.180 --> 31:47.140]  very good bud tender. She knows you. But how much do you know
[31:47.140 --> 31:49.140]  about Mike's cannabis needs right now?
[31:51.540 --> 31:53.860]  Yeah, and I'm not even but I have no there's nothing wrong
[31:53.860 --> 31:56.260]  with that. That's not your job. That's not your responsibility.
[31:56.260 --> 31:59.540]  In my defense, Mike's never come in the shop right for him.
[31:59.540 --> 32:02.900]  Right. So I mean, I can I have dabs. I'm assuming actually that
[32:02.900 --> 32:03.860]  you need indica's
[32:06.580 --> 32:10.900]  of variety but CBD Yes, it's Chris tonic. One of your strains
[32:10.900 --> 32:14.420]  Chris tonics one of my favorite green and yellow. Yeah, don't
[32:14.420 --> 32:14.980]  know what
[32:18.420 --> 32:21.380]  but if I mess with it in the daytime, I'm not going to get a
[32:21.380 --> 32:24.820]  thing done for sure. But that's exactly what I needed to do for
[32:24.820 --> 32:28.980]  me in the evenings. But we were wondering caregivers are
[32:28.980 --> 32:32.100]  important. Damn it. Yeah, yeah. Well, my point is that I know
[32:32.100 --> 32:36.100]  what Mike needs. I know I have a schedule. I've got flowers
[32:36.100 --> 32:38.660]  pretty much prepared when Mike needs them. I know like oh,
[32:38.660 --> 32:41.140]  shit, I better put that into flower soon because Mike got
[32:41.140 --> 32:43.380]  this from me a little bit ago. He got this that means pretty
[32:43.380 --> 32:45.380]  soon as jars gonna be empty. He's gonna be like, where's my
[32:45.380 --> 32:47.780]  grateful dog, bro. And I'm gonna need to have some of that
[32:47.780 --> 32:50.100]  ready for him. And no offense to you. You're not supposed to
[32:50.100 --> 32:52.660]  know that. But you don't know that shit. You're the you're
[32:52.660 --> 32:55.220]  gonna be the one providing his cannabis if they eliminate me
[32:55.220 --> 32:58.020]  from the chain. And you're gonna have to learn all of these
[32:58.020 --> 32:59.860]  people that do not have a caregiver anymore. You're gonna
[32:59.860 --> 33:01.460]  have to try to learn their medicine, you're gonna have to
[33:01.460 --> 33:04.340]  try to have that product on the shelf. Can the grow it green and
[33:04.340 --> 33:07.860]  healthy wellness supply those flowers that Mike needs the
[33:07.860 --> 33:10.980]  juicy needs that I need the you need that people in that room
[33:10.980 --> 33:12.900]  need people in that house over there need can we fucking
[33:12.900 --> 33:16.260]  supply those specific flowers like a caregiver can? No, because
[33:16.260 --> 33:18.740]  they don't have that many mother plants and they don't have the
[33:18.740 --> 33:22.180]  time. The part of the equation that really worries me isn't
[33:22.180 --> 33:26.420]  really the part that affects me directly. A lot of the people
[33:26.420 --> 33:30.740]  that use the caregiver system in Colorado are consuming massive
[33:30.740 --> 33:37.060]  amounts of THC, concentrated oil and CBD concentrated oil. And in
[33:37.060 --> 33:39.540]  the medical or the rec market, this is going to cost them
[33:39.540 --> 33:43.620]  hundreds of dollars a day per dose. When you price it out
[33:43.620 --> 33:51.300]  recreational, several $100 a day per dose, two doses a day. So
[33:51.300 --> 33:57.700]  you're looking at 12 1300 per day in medication. And in the
[33:57.700 --> 34:01.780]  caregiver market with the plant counts that are under attack
[34:01.780 --> 34:07.220]  right now, they're getting that same dose at the same quality.
[34:09.620 --> 34:14.580]  If not better, depending on the production and it'll have far
[34:14.580 --> 34:20.100]  cheaper price pennies on the dollar because of how it's
[34:20.100 --> 34:23.460]  produced and where it's produced. They didn't need the
[34:23.460 --> 34:28.340]  million dollar machine, the $2 million building the $100,000
[34:28.420 --> 34:32.660]  permits. And so they don't have to pass that on to the epilepsy
[34:32.660 --> 34:36.660]  patients and to the cancer patients that are taking 1000
[34:36.660 --> 34:41.300]  milligrams of CBD twice a day, or 1000 milligrams of THC twice
[34:41.300 --> 34:46.500]  a day. I had a caregiver give me a bottle that was I think 648
[34:46.500 --> 34:49.540]  milligrams of pure THC. What would that cost me at a
[34:49.540 --> 34:52.500]  recreational? 648.
[34:53.060 --> 35:00.420]  I'm 8090 bucks, bro. Oh, no way more than that. Right? Because
[35:00.420 --> 35:04.820]  you're right. Right. You're looking at around 60 to 90 a
[35:04.820 --> 35:11.860]  gram for good for good like co2 oil. If it was pure CBD
[35:11.860 --> 35:17.780]  tincture, a little bit of CBD tincture, MCT oil and THC. I
[35:17.780 --> 35:22.420]  mean, you're still looking at maybe 300 bucks. Okay. I'd we
[35:22.500 --> 35:28.580]  exchanged a 10 pack of seeds for that tincture because it was a
[35:28.580 --> 35:34.180]  caregiver to caregiver transaction for a child. I mean,
[35:34.180 --> 35:39.380]  recreationally, that would have cost a fortune. Yeah. For 160
[35:39.380 --> 35:42.980]  milligrams, you're looking at I mean, like 60. I'm pretty sure
[35:42.980 --> 35:44.820]  he would have given it to me if I didn't even offer him the
[35:44.820 --> 35:47.220]  seed pack and exchange right? I was like, you get something you
[35:47.220 --> 35:49.860]  know, like there was stuff here. So you get stuff for my stuff.
[35:49.940 --> 35:53.060]  It's how it works. I mean, the caregiver system is where the
[35:53.060 --> 35:58.100]  people that really, really need the high quality, high dose
[35:58.100 --> 36:01.940]  medicines, that's where they get their their their product. If I
[36:01.940 --> 36:04.500]  have to, I can deal with the recreational market, I've got a
[36:04.500 --> 36:08.500]  job, I've got access to enough cannabis product selection to
[36:08.500 --> 36:12.100]  keep myself on my feet and healthy enough to work. But
[36:12.100 --> 36:15.220]  there are a lot of people who can't say that in Colorado that
[36:15.220 --> 36:19.140]  rely on caregivers. And that's why I don't mind standing up and
[36:19.140 --> 36:22.660]  doing press or advocacy for caregivers, even though I'm not
[36:22.660 --> 36:27.460]  one. I definitely appreciate it. Well, I'm sure a lot of people
[36:27.460 --> 36:31.460]  just don't want to be seen. Even though it's more out in the
[36:31.460 --> 36:34.340]  open than it used to be a lot of people don't want to be seen
[36:34.340 --> 36:37.940]  walking in to a dispensary, right to purchase anything.
[36:38.980 --> 36:41.380]  There's still very much a stigma, you can still very much
[36:41.380 --> 36:45.140]  lose your job. It's like the porn shop. Exactly. Why'd you
[36:45.140 --> 36:46.020]  look at me like that lens?
[36:46.020 --> 36:47.060]  Because that was a good one.
[36:49.140 --> 36:51.060]  Yeah, it's the same thing as walking into the porn shop. For
[36:51.060 --> 36:53.860]  some people, they just can't be seen doing that. Yeah, yeah.
[36:54.900 --> 36:57.140]  I like hope somebody sees me walking in there.
[36:57.940 --> 36:59.300]  The porn shop or the dispensary?
[37:02.660 --> 37:05.380]  If they stalked you and watched you go to know that you're gonna
[37:05.380 --> 37:06.260]  go home and have a great day.
[37:06.980 --> 37:11.860]  It's like that joke. You go to the porn shop and buy your wife
[37:11.940 --> 37:15.940]  a toy and you pulled over by the cop and just wasn't that bad.
[37:15.940 --> 37:17.940]  You're like, I don't know I stole this truck.
[37:20.420 --> 37:21.700]  There's a sex toy.
[37:26.740 --> 37:29.300]  There's definitely a stigma attached for a lot of people.
[37:30.260 --> 37:35.460]  I still run into a regularly. I run into customers who are from
[37:35.460 --> 37:38.180]  other states who are like, I can't use the ATM in the
[37:38.180 --> 37:41.780]  building. Because my bank might know that this address is where
[37:41.780 --> 37:43.140]  a pot store also is.
[37:44.580 --> 37:45.860]  People are that paranoid?
[37:45.860 --> 37:50.420]  Oh, yeah. I mean, like a handful a day. It's not rare.
[37:52.020 --> 37:55.620]  Well, because in the large parts of the rest of the country,
[37:55.620 --> 37:57.940]  doing what we're doing and what we're talking about at this
[37:57.940 --> 38:02.260]  table will lay your ass in jail for an incredibly long period
[38:02.260 --> 38:05.380]  of time. These delicious chocolates we were just eating
[38:05.380 --> 38:09.060]  are like a serious felony in some parts of the US because
[38:09.060 --> 38:10.580]  they're made with concentrates.
[38:10.580 --> 38:12.260]  Yeah, you can pass that felony over here.
[38:12.260 --> 38:12.660]  Do it.
[38:12.660 --> 38:13.940]  Pass me that felony.
[38:14.420 --> 38:17.940]  I did 45 days in jail over a pack of rolling papers one time.
[38:17.940 --> 38:18.660]  In what state?
[38:18.660 --> 38:19.620]  North Carolina.
[38:19.620 --> 38:19.940]  Wow.
[38:19.940 --> 38:20.580]  Rolling papers?
[38:20.580 --> 38:21.460]  Wow.
[38:21.460 --> 38:23.700]  No weed, just rolling papers.
[38:23.700 --> 38:24.420]  Well, that's a great way to segue.
[38:24.420 --> 38:26.660]  You didn't even say you like rolled your own cigarettes?
[38:27.780 --> 38:33.540]  Look, I said I used it for my underwear so I didn't get shit
[38:33.780 --> 38:34.500]  stains in my underwear.
[38:36.260 --> 38:37.540]  We talk a little more into the mic for that.
[38:37.540 --> 38:38.100]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[38:38.100 --> 38:38.420]  That was great.
[38:38.420 --> 38:39.140]  Oh, my God.
[38:39.140 --> 38:39.540]  You're good.
[38:40.340 --> 38:42.340]  We're just going to make sure we get this part.
[38:42.340 --> 38:43.380]  Can you say it again?
[38:43.380 --> 38:46.500]  Okay. I told the cop, I said, well, I use those for shit so I
[38:46.500 --> 38:48.020]  don't get shit stains in my underwear.
[38:48.580 --> 38:51.300]  Coming off my asshole and it still didn't work.
[38:51.300 --> 38:55.140]  I said in court too, by the way, it was just really embarrassing.
[38:55.140 --> 38:56.900]  He gave me 45 days in jail.
[38:56.900 --> 39:02.180]  So 45 days of my life was taken away because of rolling papers.
[39:02.180 --> 39:03.700]  Rolling papers, man.
[39:03.700 --> 39:08.740]  I remember those days though when I was in band in seventh grade,
[39:09.300 --> 39:11.780]  they told us to buy rolling papers for something.
[39:11.780 --> 39:14.500]  I don't even remember what about the instruments, but the paper
[39:14.500 --> 39:16.500]  specifically was good for something with the read.
[39:16.500 --> 39:17.300]  You could read in it.
[39:17.300 --> 39:17.540]  Yeah.
[39:17.540 --> 39:17.700]  Yeah.
[39:18.420 --> 39:20.820]  I mean, that's how little I pay attention to that.
[39:20.820 --> 39:23.540]  But I remember the speech in class.
[39:23.540 --> 39:26.740]  They're like, all right, what you're buying now is currently contraband.
[39:26.740 --> 39:30.740]  If law enforcement contacts you about these, you can explain that it's for
[39:30.740 --> 39:34.580]  your instrument and that hopefully you don't get a ticket for having what
[39:34.580 --> 39:35.620]  we're telling you to have.
[39:36.180 --> 39:37.940]  And that was like 20 years ago.
[39:37.940 --> 39:40.420]  And there's still places in the country that are like that.
[39:42.260 --> 39:45.780]  Two years ago, I was, you know, a little over two years now, but two
[39:45.780 --> 39:47.780]  years ago I was in that hell, man.
[39:47.780 --> 39:50.740]  I mean, it was, and I went back about a year ago.
[39:51.380 --> 39:53.540]  I don't have a paranoid feeling here now.
[39:53.540 --> 39:54.580]  You know what I'm saying?
[39:54.580 --> 39:57.060]  When a cop gets behind me, I could care less.
[39:57.060 --> 39:57.860]  I got weed on me.
[39:57.860 --> 39:58.900]  So fucking what?
[39:58.900 --> 39:59.380]  Yeah.
[39:59.380 --> 40:00.980]  I got a medical card too.
[40:00.980 --> 40:08.100]  But back home, I mean, you know, I was that paranoid feeling came back and I hate it.
[40:08.100 --> 40:08.660]  I hate it.
[40:08.660 --> 40:11.300]  And I chest six pounds a little bit.
[40:11.300 --> 40:12.500]  Palms get sweaty.
[40:12.500 --> 40:14.260]  I starts twitching a little bit in the corner.
[40:14.260 --> 40:17.700]  You're like, fuck, I'm going to jail, going to jail, going to jail, going to jail.
[40:18.580 --> 40:19.540]  I hate that feeling.
[40:19.540 --> 40:20.420]  I hate that shit.
[40:20.420 --> 40:22.820]  So what brought you to Colorado from North Carolina?
[40:23.380 --> 40:24.900]  The this right here.
[40:24.900 --> 40:27.380]  Not that feeling, not having that, not having that fear.
[40:27.380 --> 40:27.620]  Yeah.
[40:27.620 --> 40:27.860]  Yeah.
[40:27.860 --> 40:28.340]  Well, welcome.
[40:28.340 --> 40:29.060]  We're glad you're here.
[40:29.300 --> 40:29.620]  Your vibe.
[40:29.620 --> 40:30.660]  I'm glad you came on the podcast.
[40:31.460 --> 40:33.060]  I'm glad you reached out to me.
[40:33.060 --> 40:35.060]  You said you work as a courier for a company.
[40:35.060 --> 40:37.220]  Yes, I work for Stratos.
[40:37.220 --> 40:39.860]  It's we make THC pills.
[40:40.660 --> 40:41.220]  Okay.
[40:41.220 --> 40:43.940]  And we do medical and recreational.
[40:44.740 --> 40:48.740]  We have probably the highest dose CBD probably on the market.
[40:48.740 --> 40:51.380]  When you say 15 to ones.
[40:51.380 --> 40:54.500]  So you just drop these straight into your drink and it dissolves and then you drink it.
[40:55.300 --> 40:56.820]  That's the brand new product.
[40:57.540 --> 41:01.060]  We don't have the, the, the brand new ascent on our shelves yet.
[41:01.060 --> 41:02.180]  Just the Stratos pills.
[41:03.220 --> 41:04.340]  That's pretty damn cool.
[41:04.340 --> 41:08.660]  They're a brand new product on the market last, what, six months?
[41:09.620 --> 41:09.860]  Yeah.
[41:10.420 --> 41:16.340]  They've been in business for about a year, but they exploded everywhere across the state about
[41:16.340 --> 41:17.140]  six months ago.
[41:18.180 --> 41:19.700]  I really like them personally.
[41:19.700 --> 41:22.420]  They're a, they're a great low dose medication option.
[41:22.420 --> 41:26.260]  They're their CBD products are really convenient and they're available recreationally.
[41:26.260 --> 41:26.580]  Yes.
[41:26.580 --> 41:32.100]  Recreationally, 100 milligrams and medically up to 500 milligrams.
[41:32.100 --> 41:34.180]  And we have three different times.
[41:34.180 --> 41:38.020]  The relax is like a, it's a hybrid.
[41:38.020 --> 41:39.540]  The energy is the sativa.
[41:39.540 --> 41:44.180]  And then we have also one, a sleep that I don't have because I'm not trying to go to sleep.
[41:46.020 --> 41:48.900]  The sleep that's for going to sleep.
[41:48.900 --> 41:50.580]  A lot of people swear by.
[41:50.580 --> 41:50.820]  Okay.
[41:51.620 --> 41:55.300]  The bartenders seem to, the sleep, I get more feedback.
[41:55.300 --> 41:57.620]  Is it just a real heavily activated THC?
[41:57.620 --> 41:58.740]  A yeah.
[41:58.740 --> 41:59.140]  Okay.
[41:59.140 --> 41:59.940]  That makes sense.
[41:59.940 --> 42:01.220]  That makes a lot of good sense.
[42:01.220 --> 42:02.260]  And these are sins.
[42:02.260 --> 42:04.100]  I'll, I absolutely love them.
[42:04.100 --> 42:07.700]  I'm sitting here and drunk this whole, he just medicated a snapple.
[42:07.700 --> 42:07.860]  Yeah.
[42:07.860 --> 42:09.700]  I watched him drop it into the sample and shake it up.
[42:09.700 --> 42:10.580]  I was like, what'd you got in there?
[42:10.580 --> 42:11.700]  And he's like, THC.
[42:11.700 --> 42:16.020]  We discussed medicating my mountain dew and decided that was not safe around all this
[42:16.020 --> 42:17.220]  electrical equipment.
[42:17.220 --> 42:17.460]  Yeah.
[42:17.460 --> 42:18.500]  It may fizz up a little bit.
[42:18.500 --> 42:21.940]  It would be better to probably medicate one of these water bottles.
[42:22.740 --> 42:22.900]  Yeah.
[42:22.900 --> 42:25.140]  From what I understand, you can medicate any beverage.
[42:25.780 --> 42:27.540]  It has no flavor to it.
[42:27.540 --> 42:32.340]  No, it, um, it works like a kind of Alka-Seltzer.
[42:32.340 --> 42:36.100]  If you'll look at them, they kind of look like Alka-Seltzer pills.
[42:36.100 --> 42:36.420]  Okay.
[42:36.980 --> 42:39.780]  And yeah, it'll, it'll fizz up.
[42:39.780 --> 42:44.100]  And there is kind of a taste in like a carbonated beverage.
[42:44.100 --> 42:48.260]  I can taste it, but like in this tea and I've tried it in juice as well.
[42:49.140 --> 42:51.540]  There's not really a real mild flavor.
[42:51.540 --> 42:51.940]  Yes.
[42:51.940 --> 42:52.420]  Nice.
[42:53.060 --> 42:53.540]  For sure.
[42:54.100 --> 42:57.300]  That, uh, a lot of drinks have a heavy flavor.
[42:57.300 --> 43:02.020]  So an option that I can, a medicate, whatever beverage I want without adding tincture, which
[43:02.020 --> 43:03.460]  is always a little weird.
[43:04.340 --> 43:08.180]  Um, I do like the sodas, but you can taste that medicine.
[43:08.180 --> 43:08.980]  You can, yeah.
[43:08.980 --> 43:12.340]  You can taste the medicine and then they're also kind of weedy tasting.
[43:12.340 --> 43:15.780]  I don't, you know, I like my edible, like these codas right here.
[43:15.780 --> 43:17.300]  They don't have that weedy taste.
[43:17.300 --> 43:17.540]  Right.
[43:17.540 --> 43:17.940]  You know what I mean?
[43:17.940 --> 43:18.020]  Yeah.
[43:18.020 --> 43:18.580]  I'm not a horse.
[43:18.580 --> 43:19.620]  I don't need to eat the flowers.
[43:19.620 --> 43:19.860]  Yeah.
[43:19.860 --> 43:22.100]  I just need to get that THC in there.
[43:22.100 --> 43:22.340]  Yeah.
[43:22.340 --> 43:23.780]  I do yoga in your chair over there.
[43:23.780 --> 43:24.740]  I think what's going on.
[43:24.740 --> 43:25.060]  Okay.
[43:25.060 --> 43:29.300]  So I was just laughing cause I was halfway through it and I was like, damn, Jeff's going
[43:29.300 --> 43:33.140]  to call me out on this, but like, man, Brett really had it right in the last one when he
[43:33.140 --> 43:35.940]  did like the stretches in the middle of the podcast.
[43:35.940 --> 43:38.100]  Like shout out to you, Brett.
[43:38.100 --> 43:39.060]  You really killing it.
[43:39.060 --> 43:40.260]  He kills it on Facebook.
[43:40.260 --> 43:41.460]  Bread are on Instagram.
[43:41.460 --> 43:43.460]  I post the greatest shit on Instagram.
[43:43.460 --> 43:48.420]  Shout out, shout out to evil labs at, at Mary's, you know, he has a fake, so make sure you
[43:48.420 --> 43:49.140]  follow the right one.
[43:49.140 --> 43:49.380]  Yeah.
[43:49.380 --> 43:50.740]  Mary's motivation.
[43:50.740 --> 43:51.140]  Yeah.
[43:51.140 --> 43:52.580]  Shout out to the correct Mary's motivation.
[43:52.580 --> 43:53.780]  Mary's underscore motivation.
[43:53.780 --> 43:55.780]  If he's only got two posts, it's the fake one.
[43:55.780 --> 43:56.660]  Don't follow him.
[43:56.660 --> 43:56.900]  Yeah.
[43:57.780 --> 43:59.540]  You should know how to spell motivation.
[44:00.820 --> 44:01.060]  Yeah.
[44:04.660 --> 44:08.660]  So you're a courier and you get to go to probably almost half of the dispensaries in the state.
[44:08.660 --> 44:09.220]  At least.
[44:09.220 --> 44:10.420]  What's that like?
[44:10.420 --> 44:11.220]  I love it.
[44:11.220 --> 44:12.020]  We had an episode.
[44:12.020 --> 44:13.300]  That's a great variety.
[44:13.300 --> 44:14.820]  Medical and recreationally.
[44:14.820 --> 44:15.300]  Yes, ma'am.
[44:15.300 --> 44:16.180]  Oh, that's exciting.
[44:16.180 --> 44:17.780]  Part of that makes me real jealous.
[44:17.780 --> 44:22.820]  It's a gorgeous state and I would love to spend part of my day every day driving around it.
[44:22.820 --> 44:25.380]  But after a while, keep in mind, it's September now.
[44:25.380 --> 44:29.780]  So here in a couple of weeks, that's going to turn into an extreme sport.
[44:29.780 --> 44:32.100]  Fuck, now I have to drive across the fucking state every day.
[44:32.100 --> 44:32.660]  Yeah.
[44:32.660 --> 44:33.220]  Yeah.
[44:33.220 --> 44:34.740]  But it's no fun in the winter.
[44:34.740 --> 44:38.100]  There's three months out of the year where it's okay to drive across the state.
[44:38.100 --> 44:39.060]  Oh, it's beautiful.
[44:39.060 --> 44:39.300]  Yeah.
[44:39.300 --> 44:42.020]  And you know, like independent passes open right now.
[44:42.020 --> 44:44.420]  So, but they shut that down during the winter.
[44:44.420 --> 44:47.700]  Your social media feeds or the photos are amazing.
[44:48.260 --> 44:49.460]  Yeah, I love it.
[44:49.460 --> 44:50.500]  I love it.
[44:50.500 --> 44:51.860]  So we did an episode.
[44:51.860 --> 44:52.820]  You're a podcast listener.
[44:52.820 --> 44:53.860]  So you probably listen to it.
[44:53.860 --> 44:56.820]  We talked about the craziest shit that people have seen in a dispensary.
[44:57.380 --> 45:00.500]  Going to all these dispensaries, I'm sure you've seen something crazy.
[45:01.540 --> 45:03.540]  Like what do you mean crazy?
[45:03.540 --> 45:04.660]  Just something that stands out.
[45:04.660 --> 45:07.460]  Something that you'd want to share with a bunch of people that listen on a podcast.
[45:07.460 --> 45:11.460]  Anything you've seen either at a dispensary or at like a smoke lounge or a smoke event.
[45:11.460 --> 45:15.300]  Whatever craziness you've seen at an industry event or facility.
[45:15.300 --> 45:15.540]  Yeah.
[45:15.540 --> 45:17.220]  Give me a minute to think about it.
[45:17.220 --> 45:20.020]  Because there's a few things I'm trying.
[45:20.020 --> 45:21.220]  I got to narrow it down.
[45:21.220 --> 45:22.420]  I'll let you light that joint.
[45:22.420 --> 45:22.900]  Think about it.
[45:23.460 --> 45:27.940]  He's lighting up one of the, he's got these sativas from Altitude Organic Medicine,
[45:27.940 --> 45:30.580]  premium can of cones, five high-grade cones.
[45:30.580 --> 45:33.220]  It says there may be health risks associated with this product.
[45:33.860 --> 45:34.340]  Bullshit.
[45:34.340 --> 45:35.380]  You'll feel really good.
[45:35.380 --> 45:37.860]  It'll kill your cancer and you'll have a smile on your face.
[45:38.420 --> 45:41.300]  This strain is Ed Rose Super Bud.
[45:41.300 --> 45:42.820]  Oh, the Ed Rosenthal Super Bud.
[45:42.820 --> 45:43.140]  Nice.
[45:43.140 --> 45:43.940]  That's a great strain.
[45:43.940 --> 45:46.020]  I know a dude that grew that for several years.
[45:46.020 --> 45:46.660]  Oh, really?
[45:46.660 --> 45:46.820]  Yeah.
[45:46.820 --> 45:47.300]  Yeah.
[45:47.300 --> 45:49.940]  I'm looking at the, looking, I'm at the end of the table guys.
[45:49.940 --> 45:57.780]  And I'm looking down the table and I see at least eight mainstream cannabis companies.
[45:58.660 --> 46:03.060]  I mean, different companies, products, vastly different types of products.
[46:03.060 --> 46:03.540]  Yeah.
[46:03.540 --> 46:09.460]  And just this afternoon, I was reading an article that was saying Colorado doesn't have
[46:09.460 --> 46:10.660]  real legalization.
[46:12.820 --> 46:13.780]  It hurts.
[46:13.780 --> 46:20.020]  There are people that are going to vote against legalization this November because they're
[46:20.020 --> 46:25.940]  worried they won't make enough money when their state ends up exactly like Colorado is now.
[46:25.940 --> 46:26.980]  And it's insane.
[46:26.980 --> 46:32.580]  I can't believe you to vote to risk going to jail and keeping it the way it is because
[46:32.580 --> 46:33.780]  of something silly like that.
[46:34.900 --> 46:39.220]  There's a lot of scared people that are afraid of change in this world.
[46:39.220 --> 46:40.580]  People hate change.
[46:40.580 --> 46:46.180]  I was, I was a black market grower for far too long and it's much more comfortable having
[46:46.180 --> 46:50.980]  shifted to having this badge around my neck all the time and knowing that what I'm doing
[46:50.980 --> 46:52.100]  is not shady.
[46:52.100 --> 46:52.660]  You know what I mean?
[46:52.660 --> 46:53.860]  Like I'm actually doing something.
[46:53.860 --> 46:54.580]  I'm on a camera.
[46:54.580 --> 46:55.540]  You can watch me all day.
[46:55.540 --> 46:59.060]  This is what I'm doing is where I was so much easier that way.
[46:59.060 --> 47:02.580]  Let's do run a bit, but they hit pretty nice for a pre-roll.
[47:07.380 --> 47:09.140]  I think they probably just pack a bunch of cones.
[47:09.860 --> 47:12.900]  I've, I've made an 900 pre-rolls in a shift before.
[47:12.900 --> 47:14.660]  Like I, I feel your pain.
[47:14.660 --> 47:17.380]  I was just going to say, I'm lucky in the corner.
[47:18.020 --> 47:18.820]  Yeah, for sure.
[47:18.820 --> 47:19.780]  Mike's been that monkey.
[47:20.500 --> 47:20.900]  Me too.
[47:20.900 --> 47:24.420]  But like, I also make sure that they roll and burn a little bit.
[47:26.180 --> 47:27.540]  We're a judgmental crew.
[47:27.540 --> 47:30.420]  The first one can commute, canute a bit, a little bit.
[47:30.420 --> 47:32.260]  I called the first one Usain Bolt.
[47:32.260 --> 47:33.620]  That first one could have been the Olympics.
[47:33.620 --> 47:34.500]  It was running so fast.
[47:35.380 --> 47:38.260]  This one just kind of, so, you know, sorry, altitude.
[47:38.260 --> 47:40.260]  We didn't mean to just completely bash your pre-rolls.
[47:41.300 --> 47:43.300]  I've seen, I've, I've sold worse.
[47:45.140 --> 47:45.940]  I've rolled worse.
[47:46.580 --> 47:47.860]  I've definitely rolled worse too.
[47:47.860 --> 47:51.140]  The best is when you're at a concert and you're like, I'm going to fire up this joint and you
[47:51.140 --> 47:52.500]  lie and it's just fucking running.
[47:52.500 --> 47:54.660]  And you're like, God damn, I got to light the other side.
[47:54.660 --> 47:56.020]  And then that part falls apart.
[47:56.020 --> 47:56.820]  Like this one just did.
[47:56.820 --> 48:00.100]  You can see the guy next to you go from excited to disappointed.
[48:00.100 --> 48:00.600]  Yeah.
[48:01.300 --> 48:05.540]  Well, I'll just give that guy next to me the runny joint and just fire up another one.
[48:05.540 --> 48:05.940]  Yeah.
[48:05.940 --> 48:06.740]  Yeah.
[48:06.740 --> 48:07.240]  Yeah.
[48:08.180 --> 48:12.100]  Actually, I couldn't smoke any weed the front row at Reggae on the Rocks.
[48:12.100 --> 48:13.060]  That sucks.
[48:13.060 --> 48:14.260]  That's the only bad part about being on the front row.
[48:14.260 --> 48:14.420]  Really?
[48:14.420 --> 48:15.700]  The price you pay for the front row.
[48:15.700 --> 48:18.580]  You go for a little walk and sneak off by the trees and smoke you a little bit of weed.
[48:18.580 --> 48:18.820]  Yeah.
[48:18.820 --> 48:19.220]  Exactly.
[48:19.220 --> 48:19.940]  He shook the bottle.
[48:19.940 --> 48:24.420]  Dude, at Reggae on the Rocks, I asked a couple of people, I was like, how's the check?
[48:24.420 --> 48:26.340]  And they're like, oh, they're just going to pat you down and they let you through.
[48:26.900 --> 48:27.460]  Bullshit.
[48:27.460 --> 48:28.900]  They almost got the gloves out.
[48:29.620 --> 48:33.380]  They were taking shit from everybody at Reggae on the Rocks.
[48:33.380 --> 48:36.740]  But they were cool about it because they pull your pipe out or pull whatever they found.
[48:36.740 --> 48:40.180]  They didn't find my shit, but they pull it out and they'd be like, all right, check it out.
[48:40.180 --> 48:41.700]  I'll give you the option to take this to your car.
[48:41.700 --> 48:42.820]  You're not bringing this in.
[48:42.820 --> 48:45.940]  But when you come back, if I find this on you again, we have to call the cops.
[48:45.940 --> 48:48.820]  Like we're turning you into the police and the camera right there and the camera right
[48:48.820 --> 48:49.540]  there just saw you.
[48:49.540 --> 48:50.740]  So don't fucking do it again.
[48:50.740 --> 48:51.380]  That's cool.
[48:51.380 --> 48:51.700]  Yeah.
[48:51.700 --> 48:52.420]  I feel that.
[48:52.660 --> 48:55.140]  You get the pass, at least as long as you show.
[48:56.580 --> 48:58.260]  The one little chick was like the pass.
[48:59.140 --> 49:00.260]  It's just for the record.
[49:00.260 --> 49:05.060]  I'm pretty sure the one security guard lady was a prison guard by day or a prison guard by night.
[49:05.060 --> 49:08.180]  And I stopped fucking around at concert venues a long time ago.
[49:08.180 --> 49:08.420]  Yeah.
[49:08.420 --> 49:12.340]  She's like, arms up, take your sweater off your waist, take your hat off.
[49:12.340 --> 49:13.460]  First, I'm going to touch you here.
[49:13.460 --> 49:14.580]  Then I'm going to touch you here.
[49:14.580 --> 49:15.780]  Then I'm going to touch you here.
[49:15.780 --> 49:17.220]  Now I want to check by your dick.
[49:17.220 --> 49:17.780]  Is that OK?
[49:18.660 --> 49:19.380]  Can I grab it?
[49:19.620 --> 49:21.220]  It's pretty much how they did it.
[49:21.220 --> 49:23.300]  It's because a couple of people got injured.
[49:23.300 --> 49:24.260]  I don't remember exactly.
[49:24.260 --> 49:25.140]  Some rocks fell.
[49:25.140 --> 49:25.700]  Some rocks fell.
[49:25.700 --> 49:26.820]  That was a couple of years ago.
[49:26.820 --> 49:27.380]  Climbers.
[49:27.380 --> 49:33.620]  But right before that, they really started looking at security and making some improvements inside.
[49:33.620 --> 49:35.780]  It's a completely different place.
[49:35.780 --> 49:41.220]  My first Red Rock show, I think was Fish in 95, 6, 9, 95.
[49:41.220 --> 49:42.420]  Saw Fish there.
[49:42.420 --> 49:43.460]  And it was basically a big.
[49:43.460 --> 49:46.900]  Hard to judge a venue's security from the night Fish played.
[49:46.900 --> 49:47.780]  Dude, I coined.
[49:50.340 --> 49:52.100]  It was a giant dirt field.
[49:52.100 --> 49:56.980]  It was a giant dirt and cactus and fucking brush fire waiting to happen type of field.
[49:56.980 --> 50:01.860]  And if we were a hippie wearing sandals, it was just a big toe fucking damaging spot.
[50:01.860 --> 50:05.700]  I remember Red Rocks when I was a teenager and it wasn't just a concert.
[50:05.700 --> 50:06.660]  It was an adventure.
[50:08.260 --> 50:09.540]  It's still slightly an adventure.
[50:09.540 --> 50:12.420]  If you're not into uphill, if you got weak legs and shitty lungs.
[50:12.420 --> 50:13.220]  Hike in the heat.
[50:13.780 --> 50:13.940]  Yeah.
[50:13.940 --> 50:16.580]  And then throw that water bottle away before you enter the venue.
[50:16.580 --> 50:18.020]  I kind of challenged myself a little bit.
[50:18.180 --> 50:19.220]  I'm just going to do this shit.
[50:19.220 --> 50:19.700]  Let's go.
[50:20.260 --> 50:21.700]  And I did well.
[50:21.700 --> 50:23.860]  I can control my breathing quite well.
[50:23.860 --> 50:26.820]  And I've got fucking these climber legs because I'm so tall.
[50:26.820 --> 50:27.700]  I got a lot of leverage.
[50:27.700 --> 50:29.620]  So I can just go up that hill all day fucking long.
[50:30.180 --> 50:34.180]  But I just go prepared like I'm not in fit or in shape.
[50:34.180 --> 50:38.260]  I just know that I'm going to get my ass whipped a little bit before I get to my seat.
[50:38.260 --> 50:39.540]  You got to bring a lot.
[50:39.540 --> 50:43.380]  Shorts, a t-shirt, a long sleeve shirt, a rain poncho, a bottle of water.
[50:44.020 --> 50:44.580]  It's a fucking place.
[50:45.140 --> 50:48.420]  Five hours on those stone steps waiting for the doors to open one day,
[50:48.420 --> 50:50.020]  like bacon in the summer sun.
[50:50.020 --> 50:52.340]  I did that once waiting for fish in 95,
[50:52.340 --> 50:54.740]  but I ate so much acid that I didn't know where I was anymore.
[50:54.740 --> 50:55.460]  So it didn't matter.
[50:56.500 --> 50:58.020]  That five hours for like,
[50:58.900 --> 51:00.100]  just fucking floating around.
[51:00.100 --> 51:00.740]  It was great.
[51:00.740 --> 51:02.340]  Yeah, I had no idea what was going on.
[51:02.340 --> 51:03.140]  It was a great time.
[51:03.140 --> 51:06.980]  But now, now Red Rocks looks like it looks like a state park.
[51:07.540 --> 51:08.900]  It looks it's really clean.
[51:08.900 --> 51:09.700]  It's cement.
[51:09.700 --> 51:11.220]  It's all cemented everywhere.
[51:11.220 --> 51:12.980]  A lot of the parking is now cement.
[51:12.980 --> 51:15.060]  It's not like it used to be in 95.
[51:15.060 --> 51:16.020]  It's completely different.
[51:16.020 --> 51:19.620]  In 96, I snuck over the back of the stage and watch the Allman Brothers band
[51:19.620 --> 51:21.460]  from the rocks behind the stage for free.
[51:22.020 --> 51:25.940]  This year, I saw somebody up there and I'm 99% sure security fucking climbed up there
[51:25.940 --> 51:29.140]  and arrested those motherfuckers and they got like a $10,000 ticket.
[51:29.140 --> 51:30.660]  So you can't do that shit anymore.
[51:30.660 --> 51:31.780]  Red Rocks has changed.
[51:31.780 --> 51:33.460]  They almost got the glove out and I was waiting.
[51:33.460 --> 51:35.220]  I was like, so you're going to get the glove or what?
[51:35.220 --> 51:36.740]  Because you didn't find what you're looking for yet.
[51:37.300 --> 51:38.420]  Like I've got gloves.
[51:40.420 --> 51:42.180]  Pull it out of your pocket for them.
[51:42.180 --> 51:42.820]  Is this what you need?
[51:42.820 --> 51:44.420]  Maybe you need a blue glove.
[51:44.420 --> 51:45.300]  You want this?
[51:45.300 --> 51:47.140]  I got the black pH gloves.
[51:47.140 --> 51:47.780]  That's gross.
[51:48.340 --> 51:48.900]  Oh man.
[51:49.460 --> 51:50.180]  Yeah.
[51:50.180 --> 51:50.660]  Red Rocks.
[51:50.660 --> 51:51.300]  How did we get there?
[51:51.860 --> 51:52.500]  That's crazy.
[51:52.500 --> 51:53.860]  It's been a long and strange show.
[51:53.860 --> 51:54.420]  Hashtag.
[51:54.420 --> 51:56.020]  I like it when you ramble.
[51:56.020 --> 51:58.900]  Did you think of a crazy dispensary story?
[51:58.900 --> 52:00.580]  Oh, I wasn't going to put them on the spot.
[52:00.580 --> 52:01.780]  I was thinking it would just come.
[52:01.780 --> 52:03.380]  I was thinking it would just come to me.
[52:03.380 --> 52:04.580]  Let me focus on you.
[52:05.460 --> 52:06.740]  I was listening to you, man.
[52:06.740 --> 52:08.260]  I mean, you're talking about Red Rocks.
[52:08.260 --> 52:10.260]  I'm like, have you been to Red Rocks yet?
[52:10.260 --> 52:10.900]  Oh man.
[52:11.220 --> 52:12.580]  You got to hit a concert there this year.
[52:15.140 --> 52:17.700]  The only concerts I've been in Colorado
[52:17.700 --> 52:22.340]  is the little ones they've had up in the little dab bars.
[52:22.340 --> 52:22.660]  Okay.
[52:22.660 --> 52:23.380]  In the Springs.
[52:23.380 --> 52:23.700]  Yeah.
[52:23.700 --> 52:24.500]  Okay.
[52:24.500 --> 52:25.460]  I like that, Bob.
[52:25.460 --> 52:26.020]  I don't know.
[52:26.020 --> 52:27.380]  Have you ever been to one of those?
[52:27.380 --> 52:28.740]  I haven't been to the concerts there,
[52:28.740 --> 52:31.300]  but I've been to the plenty of the dab bars.
[52:31.300 --> 52:34.900]  I'm actually, I've got tickets to see Jeff Tate and Emma Arnold
[52:34.900 --> 52:36.420]  at the dab lounge this Thursday.
[52:36.420 --> 52:37.860]  So by the time this podcast airs,
[52:37.860 --> 52:39.940]  I think I will have seen that show.
[52:40.020 --> 52:40.980]  It was great.
[52:40.980 --> 52:41.860]  You guys, you should have been there.
[52:41.860 --> 52:42.340]  It was awesome.
[52:44.500 --> 52:45.860]  I might be there actually.
[52:45.860 --> 52:47.060]  Now that you told me about it.
[52:47.060 --> 52:47.540]  Yeah.
[52:47.540 --> 52:48.740]  Thursday night at the dab lounge.
[52:48.740 --> 52:48.900]  Yeah.
[52:48.900 --> 52:49.380]  Tomorrow night.
[52:49.380 --> 52:49.540]  Shit.
[52:49.540 --> 52:50.100]  That's tomorrow night.
[52:50.100 --> 52:50.980]  That's why we're recording tonight.
[52:50.980 --> 52:51.620]  It's tomorrow night.
[52:51.620 --> 52:52.820]  I think the show's at 710.
[52:52.820 --> 52:55.460]  You can get your tickets on a friend of mine's Facebook page.
[52:55.460 --> 52:57.300]  I'll link you up with them or just go to the dab lounge's
[52:57.300 --> 52:58.580]  Facebook page and there's a link.
[52:58.580 --> 53:00.100]  Tickets are like five bucks, dude.
[53:00.100 --> 53:02.500]  I'm going to go to Christian Butte tomorrow.
[53:02.500 --> 53:04.980]  So we'll see when I get back.
[53:04.980 --> 53:05.220]  Yeah.
[53:05.220 --> 53:06.660]  I think it's like seven bucks at the door.
[53:06.660 --> 53:08.260]  So you're not going to spend too much money.
[53:08.260 --> 53:09.540]  And that's going to be awesome.
[53:10.420 --> 53:11.140]  I'm off tomorrow.
[53:11.140 --> 53:11.860]  So what is it?
[53:11.860 --> 53:14.900]  It's a comedian named Jeff Tate and his friend Emma Arnold.
[53:14.900 --> 53:17.860]  And they are doing a show called Good Cop, Bad Cop.
[53:17.860 --> 53:18.660]  Are you going to be there?
[53:18.660 --> 53:19.220]  Yeah.
[53:19.220 --> 53:19.940]  Okay.
[53:19.940 --> 53:20.180]  All right.
[53:20.180 --> 53:20.820]  I got it.
[53:20.820 --> 53:22.660]  Your microphone is getting all limpy.
[53:22.660 --> 53:23.220]  I know.
[53:23.220 --> 53:25.140]  I know how to fix it, but I need a screwdriver to do it.
[53:25.140 --> 53:25.620]  It's okay.
[53:26.260 --> 53:26.740]  Sorry.
[53:26.740 --> 53:28.100]  I didn't mean for it to do that to you.
[53:28.100 --> 53:29.140]  It's never done that before.
[53:30.980 --> 53:32.420]  I'm glad it can't perform for me.
[53:34.020 --> 53:34.900]  Poor Mike Stand.
[53:36.020 --> 53:36.900]  It's all embarrassed now.
[53:37.060 --> 53:37.560]  I know.
[53:38.580 --> 53:41.860]  The strangest dispensary story I probably have.
[53:42.740 --> 53:44.740]  This actually happened in town.
[53:45.380 --> 53:46.500]  Oh, of course.
[53:46.500 --> 53:47.140]  Yes.
[53:47.140 --> 53:47.460]  Okay.
[53:47.460 --> 53:50.420]  Pueblo is a hell of a town.
[53:50.420 --> 53:51.540]  There's one spot.
[53:52.340 --> 53:56.420]  I'm not going to say the name of it, but it's ghetto.
[53:57.060 --> 53:57.380]  Okay.
[53:57.380 --> 53:59.060]  So, okay.
[53:59.060 --> 53:59.860]  This is ghetto.
[54:00.820 --> 54:01.780]  It has a...
[54:02.580 --> 54:05.940]  Well, I'll probably give it away right here, but there's a laundromat beside it.
[54:07.460 --> 54:07.960]  Okay.
[54:08.500 --> 54:16.580]  So we go two weeks ago, we go birthday joint shopping because it was my friend's birthday.
[54:16.580 --> 54:21.940]  And she was, you know, some places give you birthday joints for coming in and shopping.
[54:21.940 --> 54:23.220]  Was it Sol's birthday?
[54:23.220 --> 54:23.860]  Yes, it was.
[54:23.860 --> 54:24.340]  Happy birthday.
[54:24.340 --> 54:26.740]  So I don't know if you listened to the podcast or not, but happy birthday.
[54:26.740 --> 54:31.860]  So it was her birthday and we went to this place and start walking up.
[54:31.860 --> 54:34.340]  And this guy comes from out of nowhere.
[54:34.340 --> 54:37.300]  Sol said he come out of the laundromat.
[54:37.300 --> 54:39.780]  I don't know, but he just kind of popped up on us.
[54:41.940 --> 54:45.540]  And it just blew my mind.
[54:45.540 --> 54:48.020]  There was nobody in the dispensary but him.
[54:48.020 --> 54:51.780]  He didn't know anything about any of the product.
[54:51.780 --> 54:55.700]  I'm like, so, you know, I asked him, they had some of our product in there.
[54:55.700 --> 54:57.300]  I said, what do you know about these right here?
[54:57.300 --> 54:58.100]  He said, I don't know.
[54:58.100 --> 54:58.980]  I don't take pills.
[54:59.620 --> 55:02.660]  He was the worst salesman I've ever seen.
[55:02.660 --> 55:04.020]  It's not hard to sell a joint.
[55:04.020 --> 55:04.660]  You know what I mean?
[55:04.660 --> 55:05.140]  Yeah.
[55:05.140 --> 55:05.540]  Yeah.
[55:05.540 --> 55:07.540]  Because you come in there for one reason.
[55:07.540 --> 55:09.060]  Not hard to sell a joint.
[55:09.060 --> 55:10.900]  I can confirm the shit out of that.
[55:10.900 --> 55:14.580]  But he couldn't have sold me ice water if I was thirsty.
[55:14.580 --> 55:16.020]  I mean, he was awful.
[55:16.020 --> 55:16.980]  That's terrible.
[55:16.980 --> 55:19.300]  And, you know, that's just the most recent one.
[55:19.300 --> 55:21.060]  I'm sure I'll come up with another one.
[55:21.060 --> 55:22.660]  Did he even have a badge around his neck?
[55:23.540 --> 55:25.060]  You know, I didn't even look for that.
[55:25.060 --> 55:26.580]  He was so unprofessional.
[55:26.580 --> 55:27.540]  You should have left with it.
[55:29.540 --> 55:31.220]  Just snatched his badge.
[55:31.220 --> 55:32.100]  My badge of honor.
[55:32.100 --> 55:33.700]  Like 50 cent taking someone's chain.
[55:34.500 --> 55:36.900]  So I just want to tell you guys, I don't hit blunts very often.
[55:36.900 --> 55:38.260]  And I just took a hit off of a blunt.
[55:39.220 --> 55:46.660]  I actually have a very rare picture on my phone of Jeffrey hitting a backwood.
[55:46.660 --> 55:50.180]  A big sloppy, drooly, funky backwood.
[55:50.180 --> 55:53.620]  I swear to God, he was like moving in the picture and it's blurry.
[55:53.620 --> 55:55.780]  And I don't care because you can clearly see the backwood.
[55:55.780 --> 55:57.860]  You can clearly see it's him.
[55:57.860 --> 56:01.380]  So like I was trying so hard, so fast to get it because he was like trying to hit it.
[56:01.380 --> 56:03.140]  Dude, if you could tell it's Bigfoot, it counts.
[56:03.140 --> 56:04.100]  Yeah, for sure.
[56:04.100 --> 56:05.460]  Shout out to my boy, Adam Hill.
[56:05.460 --> 56:05.700]  What?
[56:06.580 --> 56:09.540]  My friend, Adam Hill is sponsored by Backwoods.
[56:10.180 --> 56:13.300]  And he smokes a lot of backwoods and he rolled up a big old backwood.
[56:13.300 --> 56:15.860]  You're talking about those nasty cigars?
[56:15.860 --> 56:16.100]  Yes.
[56:16.100 --> 56:17.540]  Oh my God.
[56:17.540 --> 56:18.500]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[56:18.500 --> 56:19.300]  And he licks them.
[56:20.580 --> 56:23.940]  He licks it up like it's the nastiest.
[56:23.940 --> 56:26.100]  He posted a video the other day that was like,
[56:28.180 --> 56:30.900]  he said something that was like extra saliva or something like that.
[56:30.900 --> 56:31.380]  Yeah.
[56:31.460 --> 56:33.780]  My grandpa, he used to chew them things.
[56:33.780 --> 56:35.220]  That's pretty much what Adam does.
[56:35.220 --> 56:37.220]  He chews the end of it while he's smoking on it.
[56:37.220 --> 56:40.740]  Oh, he would break a piece off and chew it in his mouth, man.
[56:40.740 --> 56:42.180]  Your grandpa's a damn man.
[56:42.180 --> 56:42.580]  He was.
[56:42.580 --> 56:44.580]  He was a real fucking man right there.
[56:44.580 --> 56:46.580]  I'm going to get a stomachache thinking about that.
[56:46.580 --> 56:46.980]  Yep.
[56:46.980 --> 56:47.300]  Yeah.
[56:47.860 --> 56:49.780]  I wasn't even going to cough when you made me laugh.
[56:50.980 --> 56:52.740]  Your grandpa's a man.
[56:52.740 --> 56:56.180]  Back when men were men and the life expectancy was like 46.
[56:56.180 --> 56:56.900]  Yeah, yeah.
[56:56.900 --> 56:58.980]  He's like, fuck, I'll chew the damn thing.
[56:58.980 --> 57:03.540]  No, but I've met people that did that before that either just nod directly on a backwood
[57:03.540 --> 57:05.700]  or use that as chewing tobacco.
[57:05.700 --> 57:08.340]  I've met people that, I don't know how people.
[57:08.340 --> 57:11.620]  My grandpa, I grew up in tobacco farmland.
[57:11.620 --> 57:12.980]  That's where I'm from.
[57:12.980 --> 57:14.020]  I'm from the Tar Heels.
[57:14.020 --> 57:16.900]  So, you know, that was kind of normal.
[57:16.900 --> 57:17.940]  You know what I mean?
[57:17.940 --> 57:20.180]  I'm sure he grew, he raised tobacco.
[57:20.180 --> 57:24.020]  My mama sit there telling me how she used to pick it when she was five years old.
[57:24.020 --> 57:27.460]  I just felt so bad for her because this is some rough work.
[57:27.460 --> 57:28.100]  Yeah.
[57:28.100 --> 57:32.500]  So I'm sure he's probably just do a whole leap in his mouth.
[57:32.500 --> 57:34.500]  He was pretty rugged.
[57:34.500 --> 57:36.580]  I get really lit up when I smoke blunts.
[57:36.580 --> 57:39.940]  Something about that tobacco leaf just really makes me spin around and get some.
[57:39.940 --> 57:40.340]  Oh yeah.
[57:40.340 --> 57:41.460]  It's because you don't smoke tobacco.
[57:41.460 --> 57:42.820]  It's the same thing with me.
[57:42.820 --> 57:44.820]  Oh, so you don't smoke cigarettes?
[57:44.820 --> 57:46.260]  No, I barely even smoke joints.
[57:46.260 --> 57:48.580]  I mostly just dabs is my world lately.
[57:49.220 --> 57:49.780]  Yeah.
[57:49.780 --> 57:50.660]  I was a rare night.
[57:50.660 --> 57:52.020]  He's had everything that's been passed.
[57:52.020 --> 57:52.900]  Yeah.
[57:52.900 --> 57:54.340]  I'm trying to be polite, trying to have some fun.
[57:54.340 --> 57:55.060]  Except the blues is shocking.
[57:55.060 --> 57:56.660]  You're not trying to stratos you.
[57:56.660 --> 57:58.500]  Yeah, I'm not, I'm not going for any of the edibles.
[57:58.500 --> 58:01.460]  I'm trying to politely avoid all of that stuff.
[58:01.460 --> 58:02.020]  Come on, dude.
[58:02.020 --> 58:03.060]  All the cool kids are doing it.
[58:03.060 --> 58:06.180]  I'm highly offended that you're not eating any of the edibles.
[58:06.180 --> 58:08.020]  You're finally getting peer pressure.
[58:08.020 --> 58:08.660]  She just ran.
[58:08.660 --> 58:11.220]  And there's so many, there's people in the house that are not on the podcast.
[58:11.220 --> 58:13.860]  And when they were offered some of the stratos, they just took off.
[58:13.860 --> 58:15.620]  If you want that, it's over here where you can reach it.
[58:15.620 --> 58:16.820]  All you gotta do is come eat that.
[58:16.820 --> 58:18.740]  We ain't going to peer pressure you though.
[58:18.740 --> 58:20.340]  If I can get my company to talk to you.
[58:20.340 --> 58:20.900]  No, for real.
[58:20.900 --> 58:23.060]  If you want to put that in a drink.
[58:23.060 --> 58:24.340]  I think that's a winner, dude.
[58:25.140 --> 58:26.500]  These won the cannabis cup.
[58:26.580 --> 58:28.660]  This year, by the way, the code is dead.
[58:28.660 --> 58:29.160]  Yep.
[58:29.700 --> 58:33.940]  Dude, if, uh, if you guys want any of these, I've got all the flavors dive in.
[58:33.940 --> 58:35.300]  Um, don't play around.
[58:35.940 --> 58:37.060]  Seriously sample.
[58:37.060 --> 58:38.500]  I'm off tomorrow.
[58:38.500 --> 58:43.300]  I have many more like, I, uh, Lindsay, I had to stop at work.
[58:43.300 --> 58:45.780]  I had the day off and I had to stop at work for something.
[58:45.780 --> 58:49.540]  And I'd had people ask me for, or ask me if we carried them.
[58:49.540 --> 58:54.660]  And so I just grabbed both, uh, both kinds that we carried and brought them for fun.
[58:54.660 --> 58:55.300]  Dive in.
[58:55.300 --> 58:56.420]  Did you try that monkey bar?
[58:57.220 --> 58:58.900]  Not yet, but it's on the do list.
[58:58.900 --> 59:00.260]  They don't pay me to say this at all.
[59:00.260 --> 59:04.100]  But that monkey bar from incredibles is one of my very favorite edibles that's ever been made.
[59:04.100 --> 59:06.500]  It's why I have no, no, take it.
[59:06.500 --> 59:07.140]  Cause I'm not going to eat.
[59:08.500 --> 59:14.020]  I've got a lot of edibles in my, uh, uh, how much did you eat?
[59:14.020 --> 59:17.220]  So yeah, this, this is, this is why I don't do edibles for a minute.
[59:17.220 --> 59:19.700]  We've hit this twice within a 12 hour period.
[59:19.700 --> 59:22.180]  I consumed over 2,500 milligrams of edibles.
[59:22.260 --> 59:22.580]  All right.
[59:24.580 --> 59:25.220]  I feel you.
[59:25.220 --> 59:25.460]  Yeah.
[59:25.460 --> 59:26.340]  And so I'm just taking a break.
[59:29.060 --> 59:31.540]  I can't go over like 30 or 40.
[59:31.540 --> 59:32.180]  Okay.
[59:32.180 --> 59:32.740]  Myself.
[59:32.740 --> 59:35.780]  Cause you know, well, like six or 700 was hard for me.
[59:35.780 --> 59:37.940]  That was when I was going in and then I did a thousand.
[59:37.940 --> 59:39.220]  I'm on the floor.
[59:39.220 --> 59:44.340]  I gotta, I gotta completely stay still cause I need to move my head a little bit.
[59:44.980 --> 59:48.500]  I'm, I'm Ralph and run right into a, I see.
[59:48.500 --> 59:50.660]  I go real light with edibles to 10.
[59:51.220 --> 59:52.420]  Nah, 10.
[59:52.420 --> 59:53.700]  I don't really feel it.
[59:53.700 --> 59:58.100]  Just, it makes a symptom management significantly better.
[59:58.100 --> 01:00:00.740]  That's what I like about the Stratos specifically.
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:05.380]  Um, but other stuff, 30, 25, 30 milligrams is fun.
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:07.860]  Um, any more than that.
[01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:11.460]  And I'm like not fun in public high.
[01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:13.860]  I had to go to work.
[01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:14.660]  2,500.
[01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:16.020]  I'd be toasted for days.
[01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:17.140]  I woke up still high.
[01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:19.220]  I was still high when I woke up my eyes.
[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:23.220]  I'm wearing my IRI genetics logo shirt and this red print is dark, dark red.
[01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:24.340]  My eyes were that red.
[01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:24.500]  Yeah.
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:25.060]  That's for you, brother.
[01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:25.300]  Enjoy that.
[01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:26.260]  Yeah.
[01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:26.660]  Yeah.
[01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:33.460]  Feel free to, uh, let's see, man, I can't, I don't know if I want to drop a THC in there.
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:37.380]  See, I like to watch it work.
[01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:39.380]  So it looks like you can see the bubbles.
[01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:39.620]  Yeah.
[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:43.380]  I want y'all to see the, is it like Alka-Seltzer kind of, is that what you described it as?
[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:43.700]  All right.
[01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:44.660]  Here, I'll pass those to you.
[01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:46.900]  We're going to watch this happen.
[01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:52.420]  I like to eat the smallest physical, like thing with the highest milligram.
[01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:53.780]  So like those.
[01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:54.820]  Oh, it's very similar.
[01:00:54.820 --> 01:01:00.580]  Those small gummies, the one gummies that are a hundred milligrams or that one piece of chocolate,
[01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:02.420]  not a bar, a piece of chocolate.
[01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:03.620]  That's a hundred milligram.
[01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:04.820]  That's me all day.
[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:07.460]  Cause I don't want to eat a whole bar and get a hundred milligrams.
[01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:09.540]  I want to eat a hundred milligrams real fast.
[01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:14.500]  I like the exact opposite thing about the five milligram gummies because I can sit there and
[01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:19.700]  pop six of them and have that as like, I'm going to get really toasted dose.
[01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:23.700]  And I actually get to like chew and enjoy the edible.
[01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:27.620]  Most of my gripe about edibles is they're delicious, but now they're the size of your
[01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:32.900]  like thumb joint and you take one tiny little brownie bite in like, I'm a big guy.
[01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:37.540]  When I take a tiny bite of a brownie, most of the rest of my body, that's not chewing in that
[01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:40.020]  moment starts looking for more of that fucking brownie.
[01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:44.660]  And when all of the brownie has weed in it, that can get dangerous fast.
[01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:48.740]  Um, but yeah, that's why I like the lower dose stuff.
[01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:52.420]  Cause I can have a couple of pieces and enjoy it because most of them are insanely good.
[01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:54.420]  Now I've got a new idea for an edible company.
[01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:58.260]  Let's sell, we'll just copy our favorite edibles and we'll sell those.
[01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:01.860]  And then right alongside those, we'll sell the same thing without any THC in it.
[01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:03.940]  It's people have been joking about it for a minute.
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:07.060]  The first company that does it well, is going to make a nice so that you can just
[01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:09.380]  eat these and then snack the shit out of these.
[01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:13.940]  Wasn't there a documentary about one company that did that already that didn't have a lot of
[01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:14.580]  THC in them?
[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:15.860]  I don't remember.
[01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:17.460]  Dr. J's or something?
[01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:21.300]  They, uh, there's more than one company that does a larger piece.
[01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:23.860]  They just don't do it in a multi-pack successfully.
[01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:25.220]  Um.
[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:28.180]  They need to make like a dozen of cookies, right?
[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:30.820]  And they need to have one packaged in the front of it.
[01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:34.580]  And that one is a hundred milligrams and the rest are none.
[01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:36.980]  And you eat the one and then you can eat the rest of them.
[01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:38.180]  And it's fine.
[01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:39.620]  You still eat them.
[01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:42.020]  Shuffle them and set them on the table when company comes over.
[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:47.540]  That would be a great podcast.
[01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:47.780]  Only here.
[01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:48.900]  Five thousand milligrams.
[01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:49.940]  Put them on this table.
[01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:52.980]  Watch one person just slowly melt out of it.
[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:53.300]  Yes.
[01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:55.300]  That would be so funny.
[01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:57.140]  Oh, it's not funny to those people.
[01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:58.980]  No, only if everybody knows.
[01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:00.180]  Unless it's Jeff.
[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:00.340]  Yeah.
[01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:02.020]  Because he's not eating edibles for some reason.
[01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:02.420]  Oh man.
[01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:05.700]  Did you see somebody at the secret stash handed me an edible and I passed it on and they looked
[01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:06.740]  completely offended.
[01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:09.140]  Sorry, I'm on a thing and they just looked at me like, that's cool.
[01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:09.940]  But I mean, what the fuck?
[01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:11.620]  Why'd you give it away instead of giving it back?
[01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:13.780]  Like right in front of the two Jeff.
[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:14.340]  Damn.
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:15.460]  Oh, you give it off.
[01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:15.620]  Yeah.
[01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:17.620]  So you didn't say no.
[01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:19.700]  I grabbed it and I was like, oh no, wait, shit.
[01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:20.100]  I forgot.
[01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:20.340]  Sorry.
[01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:21.460]  I'm not doing those drugs anymore.
[01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:21.860]  Here you go.
[01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:25.460]  That's funny.
[01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:27.380]  Oh man.
[01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:27.620]  Yeah.
[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:30.820]  I'm going to try and get you to get in or eat.
[01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:31.540]  I'll do it again.
[01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:33.460]  It's just I'm just stubborn.
[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:33.940]  It's funny.
[01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:37.300]  It's more of a joke to me now that I haven't done eating any edibles since that time at
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:42.180]  secret sesh when I ate like 2,500 milligrams and then I tried to go to work and I was just
[01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:44.980]  fucking always eat too many edibles at secret stash.
[01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:48.740]  And I swear to God, every time we have the conversation, like we're not going to eat
[01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:49.300]  edibles.
[01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:54.100]  And I feel like the last two times you followed through on that, obviously the last two times
[01:03:54.100 --> 01:04:00.820]  I have not, it was nine 30 at secret sesh and, um, uh, Bobo blaster co Chris bought me
[01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:03.860]  a cookie and I was going to, I was going to bring this up.
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:05.220]  I'm like eating the cookie.
[01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:06.580]  It's like nine, like nine 30 at night.
[01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:07.940]  I have to open the shop the next day.
[01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:11.300]  And the guy was like, I'm eating it.
[01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:14.660]  And he's like, yeah, these cookies were like 300 milligrams.
[01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:15.780]  Like that's what I've been telling everybody.
[01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:21.220]  He's like, but realistically they might be like four or that I was like, I'm three fourth
[01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:21.940]  the way through this cookie.
[01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:27.140]  I'm like, I'm going to finish it now because like, it doesn't, yeah, it doesn't matter
[01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:30.500]  now, but like, man, I wish I would've known that before I started eating it.
[01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:33.460]  Cause I would've only eaten a quarter or half.
[01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:37.380]  One of the things I like about the rec market over the med and there's not a lot on that
[01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:37.700]  list.
[01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:43.620]  Um, but the, the, the dosing and the lab testing to perfection, it's coming to the medical
[01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:44.820]  scene very soon.
[01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:48.580]  It'll be there in, um, less than a year probably.
[01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:52.260]  But, uh, I heard November, I was supposed to be July and then they said November.
[01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:54.180]  So we have to build the labs.
[01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:54.580]  Yeah.
[01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:58.500]  Like it's just, we're working, bringing, we're creating this from the ground up, which is
[01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:01.700]  like why we're joking about like different models for edible companies.
[01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:06.740]  Um, if we're really watching it happen in front of us, it's fun.
[01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:11.380]  I had the honor of, uh, giving Lindsay and her better half, uh, Mr.
[01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:14.100]  Bobo blaster co a ride home from the secret sesh.
[01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:16.980]  I knew you were going to bring this up.
[01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:17.540]  Yeah.
[01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:19.140]  This little nappy had the back of the car.
[01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:20.660]  There was that one night.
[01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:23.540]  Here's what happened.
[01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:25.140]  First of all, that cookie killed me.
[01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:25.780]  Second of all,
[01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:28.260]  but it was the cookie.
[01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:29.220]  I swear.
[01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:29.540]  All right.
[01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:34.180]  Jeff wanted to do a podcast on the way home and I was totally down to do a podcast.
[01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:36.900]  And then we were all smoking.
[01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:42.260]  And I guess I had said that I was going to wait to do a dab and I've said, no, I don't
[01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:42.900]  want to do that.
[01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:44.740]  And Chris thought I said that I was going to wait.
[01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:47.220]  So apparently we were all waiting for me to take a dab.
[01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:50.420]  I fell asleep in the back of the car and then I woke up and I was like, all right, I'm going
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:53.220]  to keep eating so that I will stay awake.
[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:56.500]  And then Chris started, you both started trolling me about how much I was eating in the back
[01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:56.740]  of the car.
[01:05:56.740 --> 01:05:57.380]  I was like, fuck this.
[01:05:57.380 --> 01:05:57.860]  I'm going to sleep.
[01:05:57.860 --> 01:05:59.220]  You guys can do your own goddamn podcast.
[01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:00.340]  I felt like she was in a sleep.
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:02.980]  Everyone, Chris and I were talking to her and she was just blank.
[01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:04.020]  No answer.
[01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:05.780]  And then she goes, why are you guys picking on me?
[01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:07.700]  And we're like, that's like five minutes ago, Lindsay.
[01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:08.340]  Like what the fuck?
[01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:12.260]  No one has said anything to her for like five minutes.
[01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:13.540]  And she's like, I'm not even asleep.
[01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:15.940]  Then where's the torch?
[01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:17.380]  And she's like, it's on the floor.
[01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:22.180]  Yeah, I was totally passed out.
[01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:23.140]  She was done back there.
[01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:23.780]  Yeah, I know.
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:25.940]  But Chris always makes fun of me for sleeping everywhere.
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:29.140]  So I always try to be like, I'm not asleep everywhere.
[01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:30.180]  You were, you were asleep.
[01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:31.220]  I was slumped.
[01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:31.780]  Yeah.
[01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:33.140]  Some people could just sleep in the car.
[01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:33.940]  I'm not that person.
[01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:35.060]  That's why I drive everywhere.
[01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:35.940]  I totally am.
[01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:38.900]  Shout out to Dabin Granny for coming to the secret sesh.
[01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:39.780]  That was so fun.
[01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:40.580]  Dabin was dabbing.
[01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:42.500]  She's got so much enthusiasm.
[01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:44.900]  She, you know, oh man, it just hit me.
[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:46.980]  Does she wear a shirt that says Dabin Granny?
[01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:48.820]  She doesn't need a shirt that says Dabin Granny.
[01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:50.180]  Everybody knows who she is.
[01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:52.180]  Well that'd make her official, you know what I mean?
[01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:54.180]  Oh, she doesn't even, I mean, she's got.
[01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:54.980]  It's already there.
[01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:55.780]  She's just her.
[01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:58.580]  She's got more Instagram followers than all of us combined.
[01:06:58.580 --> 01:06:59.380]  Literally.
[01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:02.900]  She's got like, I think the last time I checked, it was like 156 or 157,000.
[01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:05.300]  I'm trying to protest on Instagram right now.
[01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:07.700]  Nobody follows me at all.
[01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:10.740]  I'm following myself.
[01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:15.700]  It's funny because I was listening to the last podcast and she was like,
[01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:17.620]  oh yeah, I just hit 151.
[01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:19.780]  And I was like, damn, I think she's at 157 already.
[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:20.900]  Yeah.
[01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:21.860]  It gets it going.
[01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:23.140]  All right.
[01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:24.820]  We've been going for just a little over an hour.
[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:28.020]  You guys, Jay just said something that made me think about something.
[01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:29.700]  You want more people to follow you on Instagram?
[01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:32.260]  You can tell everybody listening right now how they can stalk you.
[01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:33.380]  Say it right into the top of the mic.
[01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:35.940]  I'm not on Instagram.
[01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:42.180]  Well, I am on Instagram, but I don't have it on social media because I said I was protesting them.
[01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:45.540]  But I do have, I got Facebook.
[01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:48.500]  Where can anybody stalk you if they want to,
[01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:51.220]  if they want to check you out while they're listening to your sexy voice?
[01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:55.620]  They can go to, uh, well, my Facebook private, hold on a minute.
[01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:00.740]  He's like, I don't have a Twitter.
[01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:01.300]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:01.940]  Tell him about Twitter.
[01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:04.980]  Let me see what my name is.
[01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:05.380]  Hashtag.
[01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:06.660]  I like it when you ramble.
[01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:06.900]  Yes.
[01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:08.820]  Use the hashtag tweet that Adam guys.
[01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:11.460]  I'm at chicken fish.
[01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:17.220]  C-H-I-C-K-E-N-P-H-I-S-H.
[01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:17.860]  Chicken fish.
[01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:18.420]  I like it.
[01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:19.700]  I like it.
[01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:20.260]  Chicken fish.
[01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:20.980]  Follow him on Twitter.
[01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:22.820]  You guys send him some good stuff.
[01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:23.140]  Hashtag.
[01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:24.820]  I like it when he rambled toward this guy.
[01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:26.980]  That was my handle when I was driving a truck.
[01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:30.500]  Is that, is that fish with the band fish or just happened to have a pH?
[01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:30.820]  Yeah.
[01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:32.020]  Oh, you're a fish fan.
[01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:32.260]  Yeah.
[01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:33.940]  Oh, why didn't we just start the podcast like that?
[01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:39.380]  Well, you was talking about, uh, I've been to a couple of shows.
[01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:40.100]  All right.
[01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:40.980]  What was your favorite show?
[01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:44.020]  What, what year, what era?
[01:08:47.860 --> 01:08:49.300]  Uh, I just stumped him.
[01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:51.780]  99.
[01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:52.100]  Okay.
[01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:53.220]  That's a good, that's a good run.
[01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:53.380]  Yeah.
[01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:55.060]  I saw a bunch of 99 shows.
[01:08:55.060 --> 01:09:03.220]  I mean that really, what was a funny, I've heard of them and I knew that down for the Z song.
[01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:03.460]  Yeah.
[01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:05.220]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:05.460]  Yeah.
[01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:06.420]  Swimming around in the fish tank.
[01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:12.660]  But you know, back in cleaner back in the nineties, I couldn't just go to a torrent site
[01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:18.580]  and grab the whole catalog or some band that I've heard of, you know what I'm saying?
[01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:18.820]  Yeah.
[01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:19.620]  Now it's too easy.
[01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:21.460]  Kids are spoiled nowadays.
[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:23.140]  My friend won tickets.
[01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:26.740]  My friend won tickets to the fish show the next day on the radio.
[01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:28.900]  He was like the 10th caller or whatever.
[01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:29.780]  And I heard it.
[01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:31.380]  I actually heard it on the radio.
[01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:35.220]  So I went over, we still have pay phones back then.
[01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:40.660]  So what they called him up and said, Hey, you're taking me to the fish concert.
[01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:43.380]  And I put, you know, I said, I know that one song.
[01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:44.420]  I know that one song.
[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:49.460]  They didn't play it by the way, but I knew that one song I was prepared to sing along with them,
[01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:50.740]  but they didn't play it.
[01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:53.700]  But I did play, I kind of dug.
[01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:53.860]  Yeah.
[01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:54.420]  You know what I mean?
[01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:57.460]  If you go to see fish, do not expect to hear your favorite song.
[01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:06.340]  Now, after I got into them, I went and seen them again in Charleston, Virginia.
[01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:07.780]  Go all the way up there.
[01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:08.580]  Not Charleston.
[01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:12.260]  Charlottesville where the university of Virginia is.
[01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:12.580]  Okay.
[01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:14.980]  So I'm in there.
[01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:16.420]  This is 10 years later.
[01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:17.620]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:22.260]  And I felt like the old guy, there was, there was an older couple behind me, but somehow
[01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:23.380]  felt older than they was.
[01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:31.300]  And the one thing I, my wife went with me this time, shout out to you, baby Santana Odell.
[01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:33.700]  But, uh, bring her next time.
[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:34.180]  I will.
[01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:34.660]  I will.
[01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:38.420]  She wanted to come this time, but she had some things she had to do.
[01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:40.420]  And that's where it is.
[01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:48.500]  But anyway, I told her about, you know, soon as I went to the one at Winston Salem, North
[01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:52.980]  Carolina, the first one, soon as the lights went out, joints lit up everywhere.
[01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:54.100]  And I was like, fuck yeah.
[01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:56.260]  And my buddy didn't smoke, but you don't want me.
[01:10:56.260 --> 01:11:00.180]  I looked over here and I said, 14 year old sitting there fucking cheap.
[01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:01.780]  And I said, yo man, let me hit that.
[01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:04.340]  And he, he gave me the whole joint, fired up another one.
[01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:04.820]  Nice.
[01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:05.060]  Yeah.
[01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:05.780]  Yeah.
[01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:07.220]  14 too.
[01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:08.820]  So I kind of felt obligated.
[01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:10.820]  You know, I was above age.
[01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:13.860]  I wasn't 21, but I was 19, something like that.
[01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:17.300]  So I felt obligated to tell you from a 14 year old kid smoking a runner.
[01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:17.860]  That's what you got to do.
[01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:19.140]  But he pulled out another one.
[01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:20.180]  So he had me Trump.
[01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:21.940]  My buddy didn't smoke.
[01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:23.380]  So he wouldn't let me bring no weed.
[01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:25.860]  But anyway, I come prepared the second time.
[01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:29.940]  And I told my wife, I'm like, soon as these lines go out, you about to see something.
[01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:34.660]  You see all the joints fired up and she's like, oh yeah, I can dig this.
[01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:37.620]  You know, I've seen all the people dancing around.
[01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:38.820]  I told her all about that.
[01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:39.860]  She tripped out.
[01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:42.180]  I'd love to go see him again out here.
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:44.100]  They'll be here this weekend.
[01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:47.940]  I'm doing my best doing my best.
[01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:49.940]  People say, yes, it's sold out.
[01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:50.180]  Yeah.
[01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:51.140]  It's sold the fuck out.
[01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:54.260]  If you got a lot of money, you're going to have too much damn money.
[01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:54.740]  How much?
[01:11:56.420 --> 01:11:57.780]  Like a eight package.
[01:11:57.780 --> 01:11:59.540]  I mean, get a huge package.
[01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:02.180]  You're probably looking close to 200 bucks one night per person.
[01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:03.220]  And they're doing three nights.
[01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:06.020]  He just put his head down and defeat.
[01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:07.060]  Weren't they just here?
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:08.740]  No, they only come once a year.
[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:09.620]  Oh, really?
[01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:10.500]  That's true.
[01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:11.300]  Oh, my bad.
[01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:13.140]  They come once a year.
[01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:13.460]  Okay.
[01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:13.700]  Yeah.
[01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:15.940]  They come to Colorado once a year.
[01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:17.140]  They usually hit dicks.
[01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:17.300]  Yeah.
[01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:18.020]  That's where they're at this year.
[01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:18.980]  The giant soccer field, bro.
[01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:21.060]  They sell out that giant soccer field three nights in a row.
[01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:21.460]  What day?
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:22.020]  Three nights.
[01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:24.260]  Three nights.
[01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:24.820]  Yeah.
[01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:25.860]  Never miss a Sunday show.
[01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:26.500]  That's my advice.
[01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:28.180]  This podcast will come out the Monday after.
[01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:31.540]  So, and while you guys are listening to this, I'm probably hanging out with Doug Benson.
[01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:32.500]  I'm going to see Doug Benson.
[01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:35.060]  So, Thursday, I got the Jeff Tate thing.
[01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:37.780]  Friday, Saturday, Sunday is Fish at Dick's.
[01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:40.820]  And then Monday, Doug Benson at Comedy Works.
[01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:42.420]  So, probably taking a dab.
[01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:43.300]  Tell Doug I said, hey.
[01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:43.860]  I sure will.
[01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:45.380]  I'll dab him out for you.
[01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:45.860]  All right.
[01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:46.100]  Yeah.
[01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:47.060]  Doug's my homie.
[01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:47.780]  After the show.
[01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:49.060]  After the show.
[01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:50.740]  I fucked him up one time.
[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:51.700]  He called me out on stage.
[01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:52.100]  He looked at me.
[01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:54.340]  He's like, you got me too high, Rasta Jeff.
[01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:56.020]  Like, everyone laughed at me.
[01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:56.660]  Like, I really did.
[01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:57.780]  I kind of wrecked him a little bit.
[01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:58.660]  It was fun.
[01:12:58.660 --> 01:12:59.160]  Yeah.
[01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:02.500]  That's a lot of fun.
[01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:03.060]  Holy crap.
[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:04.420]  Excuse my coughs.
[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:09.060]  Also, Sizzla Kalonji at Cervantes, September 19th.
[01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:10.420]  That's going to be a fun one.
[01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:10.660]  Yeah.
[01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:11.940]  If you're a Rasta, if you're into that reggae.
[01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:13.300]  Colorado's getting awesome.
[01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:14.740]  It's just continuous now.
[01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:15.620]  I've never seen Sizzla.
[01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:16.740]  I'm pretty excited for that one.
[01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:20.900]  I remember a time here when you had a few good concerts at the beginning of the summer
[01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:22.580]  and a few good concerts at the end.
[01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:23.940]  And that was it.
[01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:29.780]  There was no concerts during the not beginning or end of summer.
[01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:34.420]  If it wasn't those two, like three week sections of time, there wasn't anything going on.
[01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:38.100]  The Dirty Fish Kid and me used to just pack up the car and go where the concerts were.
[01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:38.420]  Yeah.
[01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:40.180]  But now it's continuous here.
[01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:41.620]  We've always got something going on.
[01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:41.780]  Yeah.
[01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:43.620]  Have you ever been to Telluride?
[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:47.380]  You know, I've been to almost everything but the Telluride Blues Fest and the Bluegrass Fest.
[01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:47.460]  Yeah.
[01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:48.260]  I've never done that one.
[01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:48.900]  Yeah.
[01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:51.220]  I'm up there like every other Friday, man.
[01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:53.620]  They always got something going on up there.
[01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:54.180]  Yeah.
[01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:54.660]  Always.
[01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:54.820]  Yeah.
[01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:56.180]  That little mountain town stays busy.
[01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:57.300]  That mountain town is awesome.
[01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:57.620]  Yeah.
[01:13:57.620 --> 01:13:58.340]  I mean, just the view.
[01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:00.820]  I've been up there once and it was an amazing time.
[01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:06.340]  I would play lottery just to win something so I could buy a house up there and just
[01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:07.620]  tell everybody to fuck off.
[01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:11.860]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, if you've got an extra house in Telluride and you're cool as fuck
[01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:15.060]  and you're tired of it, my buddy Juicy J will trade you.
[01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:19.700]  He's got two packs of pre-rolls and a spot exit bag.
[01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:20.020]  You know what?
[01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:22.100]  I think we could donate pretty much.
[01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:22.660]  I got a gram.
[01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:23.780]  I'll throw one gram of hash in.
[01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:25.140]  We'll donate what's on the table.
[01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:25.860]  All he wants to do.
[01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:27.700]  We'll give him a whole table.
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:29.140]  I'm in whole table.
[01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:29.780]  Everything on the table.
[01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:33.380]  You could have the email can go to if we get Juicy J's spot up in Telluride so that he
[01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:34.180]  can get the fuck out.
[01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:36.660]  Let's just pick up our phone.
[01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:38.820]  It's got to have five rooms.
[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:39.940]  It's got to have five rooms.
[01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:40.820]  Anyone looking to donate?
[01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:43.460]  Everybody's going to want to come and like visit with me.
[01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:43.700]  Yeah.
[01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:44.420]  Yeah.
[01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:46.100]  Rent one room out too.
[01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:47.540]  I can get behind this dream.
[01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:48.660]  Send me an email.
[01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:50.180]  Girlfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:53.700]  We'd love to take your offers for free housing in Telluride.
[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:54.260]  That'd be great.
[01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:59.140]  There's a bunch of spots in Colorado like that that are just kind of awesome now.
[01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:01.860]  They used to be very much seasonal.
[01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:04.340]  It's a good thing.
[01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:05.620]  You think people just give you a house?
[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:06.420]  You think that'll work?
[01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:07.460]  Maybe.
[01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:10.340]  Things have happened this week.
[01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:11.140]  That's true.
[01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:11.780]  That is true.
[01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:14.180]  I'm on Twitter and see my sexy body.
[01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:17.700]  If you weren't married, I was going to be like, we need the sugar mama.
[01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:18.820]  But you know, for sure.
[01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:20.820]  She is my sugar mama.
[01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:21.780]  There you go.
[01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:24.100]  All right, Lindsay, it's time for you to do your plugs.
[01:15:24.180 --> 01:15:28.100]  Tell all the people that are still listening how they can find you on all the social media.
[01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:33.780]  So my Instagram and my Periscope are the traveling stoner.
[01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:34.980]  Wow, I almost fucked that up.
[01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:35.540]  LOL.
[01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:37.460]  Did you just say LOL?
[01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:38.420]  I did.
[01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:40.500]  Yeah, I say that all the time, actually.
[01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:45.060]  So my Instagram, my Periscope are the traveling stoner.
[01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:47.220]  My Twitter is the travel stoner.
[01:15:47.220 --> 01:15:50.100]  My Snapchat is traveling stoner without the G.
[01:15:51.140 --> 01:15:52.420]  I think it's everything, actually.
[01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:52.980]  Where do you go?
[01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:54.420]  I'm sorry?
[01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:55.380]  Where do you go?
[01:15:55.380 --> 01:15:56.980]  Oh, where do I go?
[01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:02.020]  Well, I actually started out in Jersey and moved down to Florida.
[01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:05.700]  I'm out here in Colorado, and I kind of just like travel everywhere.
[01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:07.060]  How many states have you been in?
[01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:08.500]  How many states have I actually been in?
[01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:14.740]  Oh, man, I haven't like actually done a count since I came out and everything.
[01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:16.180]  I'd have to do a recount.
[01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:18.580]  I've smoked a joint in 48 states.
[01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:19.640]  Yeah.
[01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:22.100]  That is impressive.
[01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:23.140]  Very respectful.
[01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:27.300]  And I've even snuck over into Mexico, but that's probably for a later podcast.
[01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:28.420]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:29.140]  That's pretty long.
[01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:29.940]  You're going to be back.
[01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:35.220]  Yeah, but anyway, I've smoked a joint in Mexico, snuck over in a limousine,
[01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:36.500]  smoked a joint in Mexico.
[01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:39.060]  So, Alaska.
[01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:39.940]  Allegedly?
[01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:41.140]  Wait, is it in a limousine?
[01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:42.180]  Can you say snuck?
[01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:49.380]  It would going further be a bad legal choice?
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:51.060]  Would what?
[01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:52.980]  Allegedly.
[01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:56.020]  No, I just love that part of this.
[01:16:56.020 --> 01:16:59.380]  I heard snuck and then I heard limousine and I just smiled really big.
[01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:00.180]  Mike just makes that.
[01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:01.460]  I fucking love it.
[01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:02.660]  Mike kind of follows the rules.
[01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:06.660]  So, yeah, I don't want to get you in trouble.
[01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:08.580]  Like on the one hand, I don't want to get you in trouble.
[01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:12.340]  But on the other hand, I really want to hear the rest of that story.
[01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:15.460]  Well, like I said, it's pretty long story.
[01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:16.180]  That'll be part two.
[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:20.340]  I want to make sure everybody's cool with it.
[01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:22.740]  It gets pretty vulgar at times.
[01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:26.900]  We can handle this at a later episode.
[01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:27.300]  I love it.
[01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:28.420]  It's a whole other show.
[01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:28.740]  OK.
[01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:30.660]  I just got jotted down.
[01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:33.380]  So the odds of it happening just went up to like 65%.
[01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:33.780]  Yep.
[01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:35.380]  Yeah, it's going to be a future episode.
[01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:40.900]  Sorry, I was loving to hear your 65.
[01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:45.380]  I do want to give a big shout out, though, to like in the past couple of weeks.
[01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:49.540]  I've been on the podcast a lot these past couple months, actually.
[01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:50.740]  Thank you for that.
[01:17:50.740 --> 01:17:57.140]  And I have had a lot of people message me about the podcast and say, you know, great podcast,
[01:17:57.140 --> 01:18:02.500]  you know, listen to it this morning, loved it like the day it drops, like by 7 a.m.
[01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:06.340]  There's usually one person that has messaged me and said already listened to it.
[01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:07.300]  It sounds great.
[01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:10.580]  So I just want to give a big shout out to everybody that has been listening and messaging
[01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:12.900]  me to say that the podcast has been great.
[01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:13.460]  That's awesome.
[01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:15.300]  Thank you, Linds, for supporting the show.
[01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:20.180]  Since you and Granny and Brett have been on the show frequently, the listens have gone up.
[01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:24.100]  My Instagram and Twitter followers have gone up on all of the accounts, the Rasta Jeff,
[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:27.060]  the Iry Genetics and the GFYH account.
[01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:28.260]  So thanks for participating.
[01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:30.180]  Your social media skills are fucking awesome.
[01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:31.140]  Thank you.
[01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:32.820]  So yeah, you're killing it there.
[01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:38.660]  Thanks to all those people that message Lindsay and don't message me for some reason.
[01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:43.380]  Big thanks to all you guys for listening to the show and participating with Linds.
[01:18:43.380 --> 01:18:43.940]  That's really cool.
[01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:45.060]  I get so many messages.
[01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:45.940]  Just keep messaging her.
[01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:46.500]  That's cool.
[01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:48.180]  If you want to send me a message, I'd appreciate it.
[01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:52.900]  And I owe a huge shout out to That One Mountain Girl.
[01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:58.020]  She messages me and tells me how great the episode is before I wake up.
[01:18:58.020 --> 01:18:58.260]  Yeah.
[01:18:58.260 --> 01:18:58.980]  So that's awesome.
[01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:01.940]  She Snapchats it almost every Monday morning.
[01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:04.100]  It's like getting ready and it's like the girl from the heart.
[01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:05.060]  You can hear it in the background.
[01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:08.420]  She'll be in the bathtub or she'll be taking her morning dabs or on her morning hike or
[01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:08.820]  whatever.
[01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:09.460]  Yeah.
[01:19:09.460 --> 01:19:10.580]  Love you, girl.
[01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:11.460]  It's on Snapchat.
[01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:13.140]  Her name's That One Mountain Girl.
[01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:14.980]  That One Mountain Girl.
[01:19:14.980 --> 01:19:17.620]  I think her Snapchat is Mountain Smokes.
[01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:17.940]  It is.
[01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:19.140]  That's why I couldn't find her today.
[01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:19.460]  Yes.
[01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:22.420]  And then her Instagram is That One Mountain Girl.
[01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:23.380]  But shout out to you, girl.
[01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:24.900]  I hope you're doing good in Washington.
[01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:26.260]  Yes.
[01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:26.820]  I love it.
[01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:28.100]  Shout out.
[01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:29.060]  Thanks for supporting the show.
[01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:29.540]  Yeah.
[01:19:29.540 --> 01:19:32.740]  And everybody, if you're listening to the show, we've been going for an hour and 18
[01:19:32.740 --> 01:19:32.980]  minutes.
[01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:36.820]  That means with the intro I put on this, we're probably about an hour and 20 minutes-ish.
[01:19:36.820 --> 01:19:38.740]  So I love all the people that listen this far.
[01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:39.620]  We really appreciate it.
[01:19:39.620 --> 01:19:40.980]  Thanks for hanging out at the table with us.
[01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:41.620]  It feels like you're here.
[01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:45.220]  I put new light bulbs in the chandelier and it's all bright and shiny in here.
[01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:46.660]  It's like a whole new place.
[01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:47.300]  It's amazing.
[01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:48.980]  It woke up the conversation.
[01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:50.260]  It made everybody a little more talkative.
[01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:50.660]  I noticed.
[01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:51.700]  This is a great show.
[01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:52.260]  Yeah.
[01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:53.300]  I want to thank everybody for listening.
[01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:56.740]  I want to thank Mike for coming, taking time away from his dinner, his wife, and his baby,
[01:19:56.740 --> 01:19:57.940]  and his pack of dogs.
[01:19:57.940 --> 01:19:58.260]  Oh, man.
[01:19:58.260 --> 01:19:59.460]  Thanks for coming and hanging out.
[01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:01.220]  Juicy J, thanks for joining us on the podcast.
[01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:02.900]  Was this your first podcast ever?
[01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:03.300]  Yep.
[01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:05.380]  This is going to be a regular thing, bro, because you got good stories.
[01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:06.020]  You got a good vibe.
[01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:08.340]  You're going to be here often taking dabs at this.
[01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:08.580]  Yeah.
[01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:09.140]  All right.
[01:20:10.340 --> 01:20:10.740]  Amen.
[01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:11.700]  Bring your wife next time.
[01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:13.860]  Your wife's kind of a local celebrity out here.
[01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:14.580]  Yeah, kind of.
[01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:14.900]  Good.
[01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:16.820]  She thinks she's a celebrity.
[01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:18.980]  I was about to show her.
[01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:19.780]  Should I edit that out?
[01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:20.280]  No.
[01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:21.780]  No.
[01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:22.500]  Let it rock.
[01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:24.580]  Lindsay, thanks again for coming.
[01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:25.620]  Thank you for having me, Jeff.
[01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:26.260]  I truly appreciate it.
[01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:27.300]  Truly appreciate the support.
[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:31.780]  Shout out to Bobo Blastrico for letting you hang out with me all the time.
[01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:33.380]  And huge shout out to Joe Buzzy.
[01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:36.500]  I don't know if you listen to the podcast on a regular basis, but you've taken off.
[01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:37.860]  You have taken new ventures in life.
[01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:40.500]  And I wish you nothing but the best on your new endeavors.
[01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:42.260]  But I hope that works for you.
[01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:43.940]  You guys, we're going to wrap up this portion of the show.
[01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:46.020]  Shout out to people that are in the room that don't have microphones.
[01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:48.340]  They've just been hanging out smoking blunts with us and taking dabs.
[01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:50.500]  I'm going to wrap up this portion of the show.
[01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:53.540]  And of course, I'll be right back to put a tail on this fishy.
[01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:57.540]  Did I really just say put a tail on this fish?
[01:20:57.540 --> 01:20:58.500]  That was fucking weird.
[01:20:58.500 --> 01:20:59.860]  You guys, thanks for listening to the podcast.
[01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:01.620]  I truly appreciate all of the support.
[01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:04.820]  You guys, if you have a product you'd like to review or if you'd like to sponsor the podcast,
[01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:05.460]  send me an email.
[01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:07.540]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:21:07.540 --> 01:21:09.300]  I would love to hear from you.
[01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:10.820]  I want to thank everybody for joining me.
[01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:11.860]  Big shout out to Mike.
[01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:13.060]  Big shout out to Juicy J.
[01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:14.100]  Big shout out to Lindsey.
[01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:16.820]  Thanks to everybody that was in the room smoking blunts and having a good time with us.
[01:21:16.820 --> 01:21:18.980]  People were taking dabs and smoking blunts off Mike.
[01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:20.820]  It's kind of fun having extra people in the room.
[01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:23.060]  Kept it a little chaotic, kept things moving.
[01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:24.420]  I'm going to get off the microphone and quit talking.
[01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:26.180]  It's been like an hour and 20 minute podcast.
[01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:28.340]  So catch me in about seven days.
[01:21:28.340 --> 01:21:31.940]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:23.140]  A father to see.
[01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:33.270]  When I think it's time to leave it all behind, I try to find a way too, but there's nothing
[01:22:33.270 --> 01:23:19.720]  I can't say to make it stop.
[01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:25.980]  Stealing all my lines and keep waiting for the time when I can finally say, that this
[01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:32.220]  has all been wonderful, but now my, my, my, babe, when I think it's time to leave it all
[01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:37.220]  I try to find a way to, but there's nothing I can say to make it stop.
[01:23:37.220 --> 01:24:01.140]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[01:24:01.140 --> 01:24:12.810]  I'm tired of what I can't find to say, but this has all been wonderful.
[01:24:12.810 --> 01:24:15.810]  For now I'm on my way.
[01:24:15.810 --> 01:24:20.810]  When I think it's time to leave it all behind, I try to find a way to,
[01:24:20.810 --> 01:24:23.810]  but there's nothing I can say to make it stop.
[01:24:23.810 --> 01:25:06.580]  I can finally say, but this has all been wonderful.
