[00:18.040 --> 00:20.440]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:20.440 --> 00:22.880]  It's time for episode number 72
[00:22.880 --> 00:24.160]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:24.160 --> 00:28.000]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:28.000 --> 00:28.960]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:28.960 --> 00:30.360]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:30.360 --> 00:31.640]  if you're a caregiver,
[00:31.640 --> 00:33.480]  or if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber,
[00:33.480 --> 00:34.800]  if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:34.800 --> 00:35.920]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:35.920 --> 00:37.600]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:37.600 --> 00:40.360]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:40.360 --> 00:41.200]  I'm your host, Ross and Jeff.
[00:41.200 --> 00:42.520]  Thanks again for joining me, guys.
[00:42.520 --> 00:44.480]  Sitting across the table from me is my good buddy, Mike.
[00:44.480 --> 00:45.320]  How you doing, bro?
[00:45.320 --> 00:46.520]  I'm doing well. How are you, man?
[00:46.520 --> 00:47.880]  I'm great, man. Thanks for asking.
[00:48.720 --> 00:49.560]  I'm gonna turn this music down.
[00:49.560 --> 00:50.400]  I got that real loud.
[00:50.400 --> 00:51.240]  I'm trying to yell over it.
[00:51.240 --> 00:52.080]  I just took a dab,
[00:52.080 --> 00:53.720]  and my lungs are doing that fluttery thing they do.
[00:53.720 --> 00:54.840]  I love the intro, too.
[00:56.880 --> 00:59.160]  Yeah, we got definitely warmed up
[00:59.160 --> 01:00.600]  before we started to record today.
[01:00.600 --> 01:02.360]  We just took some monster dabs of some,
[01:02.360 --> 01:04.000]  that was Gorilla Glue number four.
[01:04.000 --> 01:04.840]  Delicious.
[01:04.840 --> 01:07.080]  Extracted by my good friends, my great friends,
[01:07.080 --> 01:09.240]  my champion friends over at the Garden of Whedon.
[01:09.240 --> 01:11.320]  Big shout out to those guys.
[01:11.320 --> 01:13.840]  Those are some dedicated dabbers at the Garden of Whedon.
[01:13.840 --> 01:14.680]  Yep.
[01:14.680 --> 01:17.040]  They stayed up and stayed in line
[01:17.080 --> 01:20.960]  outside of Illusion's Glass Galleries in Boulder overnight
[01:20.960 --> 01:23.280]  to scoop a new Mothership rig,
[01:23.280 --> 01:25.520]  and they got one, and it is sexy.
[01:25.520 --> 01:26.480]  Yeah, it looks pretty dope.
[01:26.480 --> 01:28.520]  I was looking at photos today.
[01:28.520 --> 01:29.640]  Shout out to the Garden of Whedon.
[01:29.640 --> 01:31.520]  That is some dedication right there.
[01:31.520 --> 01:32.360]  Yes, it is.
[01:32.360 --> 01:35.200]  People may say that that Mothership rig is a bit excessive,
[01:35.200 --> 01:36.040]  but you know what?
[01:36.040 --> 01:37.720]  I think you guys deserve that shit.
[01:37.720 --> 01:39.400]  Fuck anybody that hates on you for it.
[01:39.400 --> 01:40.240]  They work for it.
[01:40.240 --> 01:41.080]  They earned it.
[01:41.080 --> 01:41.920]  Enjoy the hell out of it.
[01:41.920 --> 01:44.440]  Invite me over for the, check it out.
[01:44.440 --> 01:45.920]  Tomorrow, we'll go take some dabs over there.
[01:45.920 --> 01:46.760]  I like it.
[01:47.440 --> 01:48.280]  I'm coming, Spence.
[01:48.280 --> 01:49.120]  Get ready.
[01:49.120 --> 01:50.520]  Maddie, make some cheesecake, dude.
[01:50.520 --> 01:51.360]  We're coming.
[01:51.360 --> 01:52.200]  All right.
[01:52.200 --> 01:53.040]  Where was I in this?
[01:53.040 --> 01:53.880]  Oh yeah, we got to send a big shout out
[01:53.880 --> 01:55.400]  to Kat and Coot from the Mystic Roots Band
[01:55.400 --> 01:56.840]  before we go too far.
[01:56.840 --> 01:58.200]  Kat and Coot from the Mystic Roots crew
[01:58.200 --> 01:59.880]  let me use their music on the show.
[01:59.880 --> 02:00.760]  That is really cool.
[02:00.760 --> 02:03.040]  It should cost me a lot of money to play music on a podcast
[02:03.040 --> 02:04.920]  if you do things correctly,
[02:04.920 --> 02:07.440]  but they let me have access to their full library.
[02:07.440 --> 02:10.080]  They emailed me everything, all the instrumental tracks.
[02:10.080 --> 02:10.960]  I got it all.
[02:10.960 --> 02:11.800]  It was kind of cool of them.
[02:11.800 --> 02:13.600]  So big shout out to the Mystic Roots Band.
[02:13.600 --> 02:14.440]  Make sure you check them out.
[02:14.440 --> 02:15.280]  I'm going to burp.
[02:15.280 --> 02:16.280]  Here we go.
[02:16.800 --> 02:17.920]  I just had to get that out of the way.
[02:17.920 --> 02:19.080]  I was trying to force it down.
[02:19.080 --> 02:20.560]  I needed it out.
[02:20.560 --> 02:22.320]  The organic portions of this podcast
[02:22.320 --> 02:23.440]  are brought to you by my great friends
[02:23.440 --> 02:24.800]  at the Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[02:24.800 --> 02:26.360]  Make sure you check out the Rocky Mountain Worm Company
[02:26.360 --> 02:27.760]  in Colorado Springs, you guys.
[02:27.760 --> 02:30.160]  You can get African night crawlers, red wigglers,
[02:30.160 --> 02:32.320]  and all of your organic soil amendments.
[02:33.360 --> 02:35.200]  I'm not sure if they still have
[02:35.200 --> 02:37.040]  the Dragonfly Earth Medicine products in stock
[02:37.040 --> 02:37.960]  by the time you listen to this,
[02:37.960 --> 02:39.400]  but they have for quite a while.
[02:39.400 --> 02:41.160]  They've been selling them like a beast.
[02:41.160 --> 02:42.840]  Get them before they run out.
[02:42.840 --> 02:44.840]  You can use all the worm castings I use
[02:44.840 --> 02:48.720]  by visiting www.rockymountainwormcompany.com,
[02:48.720 --> 02:50.040]  or if you're in Colorado Springs,
[02:50.040 --> 02:53.200]  they are at 411 Tijuana Street in Colorado Springs.
[02:53.200 --> 02:55.040]  Make sure you tell them that you learned about them
[02:55.040 --> 02:56.640]  through the podcast.
[02:56.640 --> 02:59.840]  They might show you the worm factory, if you ask.
[02:59.840 --> 03:00.680]  The worm farm.
[03:00.680 --> 03:01.560]  It's pretty cool in there.
[03:01.560 --> 03:02.840]  Yep, check it out, guys.
[03:02.840 --> 03:04.440]  Yeah, I'll take you with me next time.
[03:04.440 --> 03:05.880]  I'll take Mike with me next time,
[03:05.880 --> 03:07.480]  and he can stick his hands in the worm farm
[03:07.480 --> 03:08.440]  and see what goes on in there.
[03:08.440 --> 03:09.720]  It's kind of cool.
[03:09.720 --> 03:11.920]  So big shout out to the sponsor that helps the show happen.
[03:11.920 --> 03:14.200]  If you guys are interested in sponsoring the show,
[03:14.200 --> 03:15.040]  send me an email.
[03:15.040 --> 03:16.200]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[03:16.200 --> 03:18.600]  I'll get you all the information that you need.
[03:18.600 --> 03:20.960]  If you want to leave some comments on Facebook, Twitter,
[03:20.960 --> 03:22.520]  Stitcher, iTunes, all that stuff,
[03:22.520 --> 03:25.120]  I'd really appreciate that.
[03:25.120 --> 03:27.120]  So let's get to the heart of the matter.
[03:28.440 --> 03:29.600]  Actually, I got to say a couple more things.
[03:29.600 --> 03:31.560]  Shit, I forgot that I've got a whole nother pile of notes.
[03:31.560 --> 03:32.400]  Damn, I'm really excited.
[03:32.400 --> 03:33.720]  We've got a big show this time.
[03:33.720 --> 03:35.520]  Yeah, I want to get to the beef of the show,
[03:35.520 --> 03:37.880]  because we've got some shit that pissed me off when I read it
[03:37.880 --> 03:40.480]  and I had to have Mike come over and kind of interpret.
[03:40.480 --> 03:43.240]  It's been a week full of some horse shit.
[03:43.240 --> 03:44.160]  I'll agree with that.
[03:44.920 --> 03:46.520]  Well, the good part of the week,
[03:46.520 --> 03:47.960]  on Monday, my good buddy Clint,
[03:47.960 --> 03:49.640]  shout out to Clint, my car has been broke down,
[03:49.640 --> 03:50.680]  Clint called me.
[03:50.680 --> 03:52.200]  He's like, hey dude, I know you're stuck in the house.
[03:52.200 --> 03:54.840]  Let's go to the 420 Speakeasy in Colorado Springs.
[03:54.840 --> 03:56.240]  I'm going to do some comedy.
[03:56.240 --> 03:59.720]  And so he picked me up and he took me up to Springs
[03:59.720 --> 04:02.560]  and the 420 Speakeasy is pretty damn cool, you guys.
[04:02.560 --> 04:04.040]  It cost me 10 bucks to get in there.
[04:04.040 --> 04:05.360]  They checked my ID.
[04:05.360 --> 04:08.280]  And once I walked in, there's a dab bar that you can,
[04:08.280 --> 04:11.200]  you don't buy dabs, you buy credits.
[04:11.200 --> 04:14.680]  And then you can trade your credits for dabs
[04:14.680 --> 04:17.240]  or flowers that you consume on site,
[04:17.240 --> 04:19.560]  or you can trade your credits for Mountain Dew
[04:19.560 --> 04:23.520]  or orange juice, or they had ice creams.
[04:23.520 --> 04:25.800]  Yeah, so it was a credit system,
[04:25.800 --> 04:27.360]  which we know what's going on there,
[04:27.360 --> 04:28.840]  but good way around some shit.
[04:29.680 --> 04:32.280]  I was welcome to pull out my own rig and my own dabs,
[04:32.280 --> 04:33.480]  cause I'm kind of a dab snob.
[04:33.480 --> 04:34.320]  I didn't really want to-
[04:34.320 --> 04:36.240]  Most of those places are BYO everything.
[04:36.240 --> 04:37.080]  Yeah, yeah.
[04:37.080 --> 04:39.480]  Or rent glass, but bring your own everything to put it in.
[04:39.520 --> 04:41.320]  They did have sweet rigs for rent,
[04:41.320 --> 04:42.280]  but of course I show up,
[04:42.280 --> 04:45.320]  I took the Eric Ross 4.0 custom rig,
[04:45.320 --> 04:47.640]  so I had no need for any other rig.
[04:47.640 --> 04:48.880]  And I brought my own Earl with me.
[04:48.880 --> 04:51.600]  So we sat at a booth and just dabbed out.
[04:51.600 --> 04:54.560]  Dustin, Drew, Clint, and myself sat there and dabbed.
[04:54.560 --> 04:55.600]  Clint didn't take any dabs.
[04:55.600 --> 04:57.880]  He's kind of a puss, but he smoked weed with us.
[04:57.880 --> 04:58.960]  He had something to do that night.
[04:58.960 --> 05:01.560]  Yeah, and then he did a set of comedy that was,
[05:01.560 --> 05:02.760]  it was different.
[05:02.760 --> 05:04.720]  Clint had a life-changing event that day.
[05:04.720 --> 05:08.160]  And so the comedy really let that event come out on stage.
[05:08.160 --> 05:09.240]  And that was quite entertaining.
[05:09.920 --> 05:11.520]  Yeah.
[05:11.520 --> 05:12.720]  Shout out to Ben Verbeck.
[05:12.720 --> 05:14.560]  He hosts, it's called Comedy Anarchy
[05:14.560 --> 05:16.720]  at the 420 Speakeasy on Mondays.
[05:16.720 --> 05:18.320]  I think it starts at eight.
[05:18.320 --> 05:19.520]  So if you guys want some comedy,
[05:19.520 --> 05:20.960]  you want to go smoke some weed,
[05:20.960 --> 05:23.120]  you want to take some dabs, check that place out.
[05:23.120 --> 05:23.960]  They don't-
[05:23.960 --> 05:24.800]  You're having up your Monday, people.
[05:24.800 --> 05:26.360]  Yeah, yeah, get out on a Monday, go see some funny,
[05:26.360 --> 05:27.440]  go support my friend Clint,
[05:27.440 --> 05:30.520]  go support comedy and Ben Verbeck.
[05:30.520 --> 05:31.880]  Yeah.
[05:31.880 --> 05:33.640]  It was fun because you could dab and see comedy.
[05:33.640 --> 05:34.880]  They don't pay me or anything to say that.
[05:34.880 --> 05:36.400]  I just had a good time, wanted to talk about it.
[05:36.400 --> 05:38.400]  It's really cool having a place.
[05:38.560 --> 05:40.920]  I wasn't at home and I was with a few of my bros
[05:40.920 --> 05:42.440]  and I was meeting new bros,
[05:42.440 --> 05:44.160]  just taking dabs and kicking back.
[05:45.000 --> 05:46.040]  And it was open mic comedy.
[05:46.040 --> 05:48.640]  So there was moments of free entertainment.
[05:49.880 --> 05:50.720]  Moments.
[05:51.640 --> 05:52.880]  So go to the 420 Speakeasy.
[05:52.880 --> 05:54.320]  It was fun, that's my point.
[05:54.320 --> 05:55.560]  Check it out, folks.
[05:55.560 --> 05:58.160]  Also, somebody sent me an email asking me,
[05:58.160 --> 05:59.920]  they want to add another light to their room
[05:59.920 --> 06:01.680]  and they wanted to know what the best type of light
[06:01.680 --> 06:03.920]  would be in their situation.
[06:03.920 --> 06:06.200]  Right now, the light I would recommend would be a Govita
[06:06.200 --> 06:08.040]  for almost any situation.
[06:08.680 --> 06:09.520]  Other than like a tent.
[06:09.520 --> 06:11.600]  If you've got a room and you're trying to put new lights
[06:11.600 --> 06:12.920]  in there, go Govitas.
[06:12.920 --> 06:13.760]  Those are sweet.
[06:13.760 --> 06:16.400]  The double-ended bulb technology will push your plants
[06:16.400 --> 06:18.080]  to another level.
[06:18.080 --> 06:20.000]  So I hope that answers your question there, dude.
[06:20.000 --> 06:20.960]  Get a Govita.
[06:20.960 --> 06:21.800]  I emailed you.
[06:21.800 --> 06:23.560]  I hope you respond to the email also.
[06:24.600 --> 06:25.760]  I want to brag about something.
[06:25.760 --> 06:29.560]  The podcast on Stitcher, we have reached a peak rank
[06:29.560 --> 06:33.640]  of 748th out of 40,000 shows.
[06:33.640 --> 06:34.480]  Way to go, man.
[06:34.480 --> 06:35.360]  Thank you, bro.
[06:35.360 --> 06:37.040]  That's a lot of listens, you guys.
[06:37.040 --> 06:39.200]  Spectacular, especially through Stitcher.
[06:39.200 --> 06:41.840]  Yeah, just Stitcher alone on Mondays,
[06:41.840 --> 06:42.720]  you guys are listening.
[06:42.720 --> 06:46.120]  You download the show, 5,000 downloads on Monday morning.
[06:46.120 --> 06:47.120]  Keep it up, everybody.
[06:47.120 --> 06:48.720]  Yeah, thank you guys.
[06:48.720 --> 06:51.040]  I want to thank everybody that downloads it on Stitcher,
[06:51.040 --> 06:52.240]  iTunes, and the website.
[06:52.240 --> 06:53.920]  I appreciate that.
[06:53.920 --> 06:57.360]  We moved up in the ranks on Stitcher quite dramatically
[06:57.360 --> 07:00.400]  in the lifestyle, the health and lifestyle category.
[07:00.400 --> 07:03.240]  We were ranked number 59 this week.
[07:03.240 --> 07:06.320]  I think that that is because of me being
[07:06.560 --> 07:10.000]  a guest speaker on the Medical Marijuana Radio show
[07:10.000 --> 07:12.160]  about a week ago with LS Love.
[07:12.160 --> 07:14.440]  He definitely plugged my show heavily.
[07:14.440 --> 07:15.280]  Nice.
[07:15.280 --> 07:17.840]  So I want to send a huge, huge shout out to LS Love.
[07:17.840 --> 07:19.160]  If you don't already listen to it,
[07:19.160 --> 07:21.600]  make sure you go listen to Medical Marijuana Radio
[07:21.600 --> 07:23.200]  with LS Love.
[07:23.200 --> 07:24.600]  It's on YouTube.
[07:24.600 --> 07:26.120]  I have not found it on iTunes.
[07:26.120 --> 07:28.640]  I think I'm going to help him get his show on iTunes
[07:28.640 --> 07:29.840]  because that's what he really needs.
[07:29.840 --> 07:30.840]  Nice, step him up a little bit.
[07:30.840 --> 07:32.600]  Yeah, just teach him about that.
[07:32.600 --> 07:33.760]  So shout out to LS Love.
[07:33.760 --> 07:35.080]  Thank you guys for listening, dude.
[07:35.080 --> 07:38.040]  Oh my God, 5,000 people just on Stitcher?
[07:38.040 --> 07:38.880]  That is crazy.
[07:38.880 --> 07:40.080]  Dude, thanks for the love, everybody.
[07:40.080 --> 07:41.840]  That means another 5,000 on iTunes
[07:41.840 --> 07:44.720]  and probably another half of that on my website.
[07:44.720 --> 07:45.560]  So we're getting-
[07:45.560 --> 07:47.280]  Right, I downloaded straight off the website.
[07:47.280 --> 07:48.640]  So I've just got it on my phone
[07:48.640 --> 07:51.160]  to play whenever when I'm rolling, but-
[07:51.160 --> 07:52.320]  And that's just- Stitcher it up, people.
[07:52.320 --> 07:55.240]  Stitcher shows me on Mondays that 5,000 people listen.
[07:55.240 --> 07:56.080]  Nice.
[07:56.080 --> 07:56.920]  Yeah, just on Monday.
[07:56.920 --> 07:58.400]  That's crazy.
[07:58.400 --> 08:00.880]  So thank you guys, all 5,000 of you that listen on Monday.
[08:00.880 --> 08:02.520]  Everybody that listens through the week, thank you guys.
[08:02.520 --> 08:03.720]  I hope you're in your garden.
[08:03.720 --> 08:04.640]  Hope you're driving to work.
[08:05.200 --> 08:07.040]  I hope I'm making your garden time, your work time.
[08:07.040 --> 08:08.200]  Maybe you're stuck in a cubicle.
[08:08.200 --> 08:09.240]  If you're stuck in that cubicle,
[08:09.240 --> 08:10.880]  I know you know who I'm talking to.
[08:10.880 --> 08:12.680]  I hope I'm making your day better.
[08:12.680 --> 08:14.520]  So we did that.
[08:14.520 --> 08:15.920]  We're gonna get to the news, I promise,
[08:15.920 --> 08:18.600]  but I wanna talk about one more thing.
[08:18.600 --> 08:22.680]  I am a supporter of a company called
[08:22.680 --> 08:23.760]  Grassroots California.
[08:23.760 --> 08:25.680]  They make these stylish hats that I wear.
[08:25.680 --> 08:27.960]  They make some pretty cool clothing.
[08:27.960 --> 08:28.800]  They make-
[08:28.800 --> 08:29.640]  I'm a fan as well.
[08:29.640 --> 08:31.040]  Well, right on.
[08:31.040 --> 08:33.920]  The company Grassroots has a store in Denver.
[08:33.960 --> 08:35.640]  We gotta get you a Grassroots hat, dude.
[08:35.640 --> 08:36.480]  We do.
[08:36.480 --> 08:37.960]  Get this beanie off my head.
[08:37.960 --> 08:39.040]  People will thank you.
[08:39.040 --> 08:40.640]  He's been wearing a beanie since I met him,
[08:40.640 --> 08:42.440]  through the summer, through the winter,
[08:42.440 --> 08:43.280]  for like seven years.
[08:43.280 --> 08:44.240]  Shout out to Ashley.
[08:44.240 --> 08:45.160]  Hell of a beanie.
[08:45.160 --> 08:48.640]  And I've been promised she's gonna visit here sometime
[08:48.640 --> 08:50.680]  in the next year and make me a new one.
[08:50.680 --> 08:51.520]  So we're never gonna get you a hat.
[08:51.520 --> 08:52.480]  Help me pick another color.
[08:52.480 --> 08:53.680]  It's just gonna be a beanie forever.
[08:53.680 --> 08:54.520]  He looks good on you.
[08:54.520 --> 08:55.600]  We're not gonna change you.
[08:55.600 --> 08:58.800]  So the guys at Grassroots, shout out to Ryan.
[08:58.800 --> 09:01.000]  He's the owner and founder of Grassroots California.
[09:01.000 --> 09:02.240]  They're a hat company.
[09:02.240 --> 09:03.480]  They support the cannabis movement.
[09:04.040 --> 09:06.360]  They host the 710 Cup, which is a dab festival
[09:06.360 --> 09:09.000]  where it's a dab competition.
[09:09.000 --> 09:11.480]  But they opened a business called The Break Room.
[09:11.480 --> 09:14.160]  What The Break Room was, was a smoking lounge
[09:14.160 --> 09:15.200]  that you could bring your own.
[09:15.200 --> 09:16.280]  They didn't sell anything there,
[09:16.280 --> 09:18.800]  but you had to bring your own hash, your own flowers,
[09:18.800 --> 09:20.200]  and you could hang out in this building
[09:20.200 --> 09:21.640]  and socialize and smoke.
[09:21.640 --> 09:23.520]  And they had games and activities to do
[09:23.520 --> 09:25.760]  to keep you entertained and snacked, of course.
[09:25.760 --> 09:30.760]  So on 420, the Denver police raided The Break Room.
[09:31.360 --> 09:33.320]  They weren't the only ones raided, but they were-
[09:34.160 --> 09:35.160]  Among those raided on 420.
[09:35.160 --> 09:37.840]  There was a huge sweep on 420, which, come on, cops,
[09:37.840 --> 09:39.000]  it's a dick move, bro.
[09:39.000 --> 09:40.520]  Come on.
[09:40.520 --> 09:43.960]  Our rape solve rate is still at like 40% of people.
[09:43.960 --> 09:45.160]  Yeah, but-
[09:45.160 --> 09:46.880]  We're raiding speakeasies.
[09:46.880 --> 09:51.000]  Yeah, so they go in and they raid The Break Room
[09:51.000 --> 09:52.840]  and they shut the place down.
[09:53.760 --> 09:58.120]  And in turn, they shut down The Grassroots store.
[09:58.120 --> 10:00.800]  But The Grassroots store is a separate business.
[10:00.800 --> 10:03.120]  In a separate, the store is divided.
[10:03.880 --> 10:05.640]  There's a separate staff, a separate cash register,
[10:05.640 --> 10:07.640]  a separate entrance.
[10:07.640 --> 10:10.680]  And since it's Ryan's store and everything,
[10:10.680 --> 10:12.640]  they shut down both buildings.
[10:12.640 --> 10:14.480]  And now they are forcing,
[10:14.480 --> 10:17.000]  the city of Denver is kind of strong arm
[10:17.000 --> 10:19.520]  forcing the owner of the building to evict Ryan
[10:19.520 --> 10:21.520]  from their prime location on Larimer,
[10:21.520 --> 10:23.240]  where they've never had a problem.
[10:23.240 --> 10:24.840]  They've got such good sales there
[10:24.840 --> 10:25.800]  because of their location.
[10:25.800 --> 10:27.080]  It's a sweet spot.
[10:27.080 --> 10:28.720]  They've never done anything wrong.
[10:28.720 --> 10:31.600]  And now this dude that has put his life into this company
[10:31.600 --> 10:33.400]  to make these sweet hats that I wear
[10:33.400 --> 10:34.520]  and that you guys probably wear
[10:34.520 --> 10:36.160]  if you're a part of the movement and you listen to the show,
[10:36.160 --> 10:37.400]  I'm sure one out of 10 of you guys
[10:37.400 --> 10:39.680]  has got a Grassroots hat on right now.
[10:39.680 --> 10:41.760]  He's gonna be forced to move out of that building
[10:41.760 --> 10:44.120]  and find another building, which is gonna be hard
[10:44.120 --> 10:45.440]  because everybody already knows-
[10:45.440 --> 10:46.280]  It's crazy hard.
[10:46.280 --> 10:47.480]  Oh, they know who he's gonna be.
[10:47.480 --> 10:48.760]  They don't want him there now.
[10:48.760 --> 10:49.600]  They're gonna say no
[10:49.600 --> 10:50.760]  because you're gonna open another pot business
[10:50.760 --> 10:51.640]  and you're gonna break the rules.
[10:51.640 --> 10:54.560]  So you guys, he's got a GoFundMe
[10:54.560 --> 10:55.880]  and all kinds of crowdsourcing.
[10:55.880 --> 10:56.800]  It would be really cool.
[10:56.800 --> 10:58.040]  I'm not gonna beg for Ryan,
[10:58.040 --> 11:00.960]  but support Ryan any way that you can.
[11:01.320 --> 11:02.680]  Talk to your council people in Denver,
[11:02.680 --> 11:04.320]  talk to the Denver City attorneys,
[11:04.320 --> 11:05.920]  let them know that you think it's bullshit.
[11:05.920 --> 11:06.880]  Your opinion does matter.
[11:06.880 --> 11:09.280]  And if they hear it enough, it might make a difference.
[11:09.280 --> 11:10.840]  This is the first time we're asking you
[11:10.840 --> 11:11.920]  to get involved tonight.
[11:11.920 --> 11:13.040]  It won't be the last.
[11:14.120 --> 11:16.040]  Yes, Mike definitely needs you to get off the couch
[11:16.040 --> 11:16.880]  and help us do things.
[11:16.880 --> 11:18.360]  It's not just me, man.
[11:18.360 --> 11:20.040]  Every cannabis consumer
[11:20.040 --> 11:22.400]  needs every other cannabis consumer to stand the fuck up.
[11:22.400 --> 11:23.240]  That's the truth.
[11:23.240 --> 11:25.200]  We slept a little bit on some voting
[11:25.200 --> 11:26.840]  and it looks like we got fucked by sleeping
[11:26.840 --> 11:28.640]  because I'm gonna read you some shit in just a minute
[11:28.640 --> 11:30.000]  that you're gonna say, wait, that happened?
[11:30.000 --> 11:32.400]  There's lots of fugly headed up later in the show.
[11:32.400 --> 11:33.240]  Yeah, sorry.
[11:33.240 --> 11:34.120]  Yeah. Stay tuned.
[11:34.120 --> 11:35.720]  All right, so let's get into those news articles
[11:35.720 --> 11:37.400]  that we've been talking about.
[11:37.400 --> 11:39.320]  I'm gonna take a quick small drink of this here.
[11:39.320 --> 11:41.080]  You take a drink and then we'll get into some news.
[11:41.080 --> 11:41.920]  Chug it.
[11:44.660 --> 11:47.900]  All right, I'm nice and hydrated now.
[11:47.900 --> 11:48.940]  I'm looking for this news article.
[11:48.940 --> 11:50.900]  I've got so many things on the screen.
[11:50.900 --> 11:54.300]  All right, it's been a big week in Colorado news.
[11:54.300 --> 11:55.340]  Yeah, let's start with this one.
[11:55.340 --> 11:57.420]  This one's from the Westward.
[11:57.420 --> 12:00.380]  The headline is medical marijuana crackdown bill now law.
[12:00.420 --> 12:02.460]  More about money than safety.
[12:02.460 --> 12:04.700]  And the article is by Michael Roberts.
[12:05.580 --> 12:06.940]  And it goes like this.
[12:06.940 --> 12:11.580]  Today, governor John Hickenlooper signed Senate bill 15-014,
[12:11.580 --> 12:14.780]  which has been characterized as a medical pot crackdown bill.
[12:15.860 --> 12:18.740]  Among other things, the legislation will empower a board
[12:18.740 --> 12:21.180]  in consultation with the Colorado Department of Public Health
[12:21.180 --> 12:23.860]  and Environment to establish guidelines for physicians
[12:23.860 --> 12:26.660]  making medical marijuana recommendations.
[12:26.660 --> 12:28.740]  The provision is backed by those like Aguilar
[12:28.740 --> 12:31.900]  who doubt that most medical marijuana card holders
[12:31.900 --> 12:34.780]  receiving recommendations for treatment of severe pain,
[12:34.780 --> 12:37.900]  a group that makes up approximately 93% of the total
[12:37.900 --> 12:40.020]  actually suffer from this condition.
[12:40.980 --> 12:43.500]  Now, we'll take a minute to bitch about this.
[12:43.500 --> 12:45.580]  There's a lot of stuff in there.
[12:45.580 --> 12:50.580]  First, the 93% of Colorado medical marijuana card holders
[12:51.320 --> 12:53.460]  list chronic and severe pain
[12:53.460 --> 12:57.620]  as one of their qualifying conditions.
[12:57.620 --> 13:00.860]  If you add all of the qualifying conditions up,
[13:00.860 --> 13:02.420]  you get way more than 100%.
[13:02.420 --> 13:04.220]  And it's because a lot of people list that
[13:04.220 --> 13:06.980]  along with cancer, AIDS, MS.
[13:06.980 --> 13:08.580]  Kachexia is one of the major ones.
[13:08.580 --> 13:10.060]  Right, Crohn's.
[13:10.060 --> 13:12.660]  There's countless other ailments
[13:12.660 --> 13:16.220]  on the list of qualifying conditions that cause severe pain.
[13:16.220 --> 13:18.060]  And so pretty much everyone
[13:18.060 --> 13:19.980]  with a medical marijuana card in Colorado
[13:19.980 --> 13:21.540]  also includes severe pain
[13:21.540 --> 13:23.660]  when they're signing up with their doctor.
[13:23.700 --> 13:25.620]  What the legislature has done
[13:25.620 --> 13:30.140]  and the theory I guess for several years has been
[13:30.140 --> 13:32.940]  that that 97% number is the fakers.
[13:34.060 --> 13:38.340]  And so when, I don't know, when people, I suppose,
[13:38.340 --> 13:41.200]  park in outside dispensaries across the street
[13:41.200 --> 13:43.540]  and watch people come and go every day,
[13:43.540 --> 13:44.780]  like there were all kinds of people
[13:44.780 --> 13:47.860]  claiming they did this regularly right after we legalized
[13:47.860 --> 13:49.860]  and right after the medical expansion.
[13:49.860 --> 13:51.780]  You can't tell what's wrong with me
[13:51.780 --> 13:54.380]  by the way I walk from my car to the dispensary.
[13:54.380 --> 13:58.060]  Right, you can't see my nerve damage from 20 yards away.
[13:58.060 --> 14:00.980]  You can't see that, yeah, I don't even need to talk about,
[14:00.980 --> 14:03.380]  I don't, I have plenty of medical conditions
[14:03.380 --> 14:04.740]  we could talk about.
[14:04.740 --> 14:06.360]  My pain is one of them,
[14:06.360 --> 14:08.900]  but it's, I shouldn't even have to say what's wrong with me.
[14:08.900 --> 14:10.440]  I've got a medical marijuana card
[14:10.440 --> 14:11.940]  and it's really not that detective
[14:11.940 --> 14:14.500]  or that nosy person's business what my problem is.
[14:14.500 --> 14:19.420]  Right, so these people have decided that that 97% number
[14:19.420 --> 14:22.940]  is probably all of the fakers in Colorado,
[14:22.940 --> 14:25.060]  which is like 97,000 people
[14:25.060 --> 14:27.180]  because there's roughly 100,000 people
[14:27.180 --> 14:28.780]  on the registry right now.
[14:28.780 --> 14:29.620]  Wow.
[14:29.620 --> 14:32.580]  So they're assuming roughly 97,000 people
[14:32.580 --> 14:34.740]  are basically faking.
[14:34.740 --> 14:38.160]  And this bill is a big attempt to push as many of them
[14:38.160 --> 14:40.860]  as they can back into the rec market
[14:40.860 --> 14:43.540]  where we're paying 20% more taxes.
[14:43.540 --> 14:44.380]  Yeah, let me get into the article
[14:44.380 --> 14:45.780]  because you're going to blow this guy's whole paper.
[14:45.780 --> 14:46.700]  This guy wrote an article
[14:46.700 --> 14:48.780]  and you just fucking shot it all down for him.
[14:49.100 --> 14:50.340]  You just buried the lead for this guy
[14:50.340 --> 14:51.620]  that took time onto this article.
[14:51.620 --> 14:54.740]  No, it says, but is this new rule more about safety
[14:54.740 --> 14:57.900]  or money even though 15-014 is now law,
[14:57.900 --> 14:59.660]  the debate continues to rage.
[14:59.660 --> 15:01.500]  The highest profile backer of the bill
[15:01.500 --> 15:02.900]  was Senator Irene Aguilar,
[15:02.900 --> 15:06.220]  whose website lists her as Senator Irene Aguilar MD
[15:06.220 --> 15:08.580]  and stresses her own medical background.
[15:08.580 --> 15:11.700]  So what Mike was getting at is
[15:11.700 --> 15:13.060]  they're trying to make it harder
[15:13.060 --> 15:17.380]  for you to get a medical marijuana card for your pain.
[15:17.380 --> 15:19.740]  And we suspect that it's to drive you
[15:19.740 --> 15:23.220]  to the recreational dispensaries where taxes are higher
[15:23.220 --> 15:25.680]  and you've got to spend more money and pay more taxes
[15:25.680 --> 15:27.340]  and the state makes more money
[15:27.340 --> 15:29.260]  because a lot of the things that we see going on
[15:29.260 --> 15:32.380]  in this bill are all about the taxes and the money
[15:32.380 --> 15:34.100]  and fuck the patients and the caregivers.
[15:34.100 --> 15:37.260]  Yeah, this is a long bill and it does several things.
[15:37.260 --> 15:39.820]  And I think if you take a look at it as a whole,
[15:39.820 --> 15:42.220]  all of the things it does are designed to push people
[15:42.220 --> 15:44.860]  off of the medical registry and into the rec market.
[15:44.860 --> 15:46.300]  The next paragraph in this article
[15:47.020 --> 15:48.860]  is an excerpt from this lady's website.
[15:48.860 --> 15:51.860]  And basically it brags and says, I'm too cool for you.
[15:51.860 --> 15:53.460]  It talks about all the places she went to school
[15:53.460 --> 15:56.020]  and her qualifications, you guys don't care.
[15:56.020 --> 15:58.020]  Then it goes on to say,
[15:58.020 --> 16:00.060]  will the bill's new guidelines make it more difficult
[16:00.060 --> 16:01.980]  for physicians to recommend medical marijuana
[16:01.980 --> 16:04.280]  to those who say they are plagued by severe pain?
[16:04.280 --> 16:08.340]  If so, longtime Westward marijuana writer, William Breeds,
[16:08.340 --> 16:10.620]  fears some patients who really need MMJ
[16:10.620 --> 16:13.120]  will be deprived of the recommendations.
[16:13.120 --> 16:15.620]  And then here's an excerpt from another article
[16:15.660 --> 16:17.700]  he wrote in March that says,
[16:17.700 --> 16:20.500]  studies show that as many as 100 million Americans
[16:20.500 --> 16:22.060]  suffer from chronic pain
[16:22.060 --> 16:24.500]  and that it affects more people than diabetes,
[16:24.500 --> 16:27.260]  coronary heart disease and cancer combined.
[16:27.260 --> 16:29.900]  According to the American Academy of Pain Medicine,
[16:29.900 --> 16:33.220]  20% of all American adults experience chronic pain
[16:33.220 --> 16:34.780]  severe enough to disrupt their sleep
[16:34.780 --> 16:36.620]  at least two times per week.
[16:36.620 --> 16:37.500]  The number of patients
[16:37.500 --> 16:39.780]  on the Colorado Medical Marijuana Registry
[16:39.780 --> 16:44.300]  who claim severe pain is around 105,500 people,
[16:44.300 --> 16:48.500]  just below 2% of the total population of the state.
[16:48.500 --> 16:50.900]  The fact that 1.9% of the state's residents
[16:50.900 --> 16:53.740]  experience chronic pain and have turned to cannabis to help
[16:53.740 --> 16:56.580]  is hardly surprising or shocking.
[16:56.580 --> 16:59.580]  So Breeds also notes, excuse me,
[16:59.580 --> 17:01.460]  Breeds also notes that the assorted lawmakers
[17:01.460 --> 17:04.120]  in favor of the proposals have made it clear
[17:04.120 --> 17:06.100]  that the measure is a way to improve
[17:06.100 --> 17:07.460]  some medical marijuana patient,
[17:07.460 --> 17:08.820]  oh, sorry, I read that wrong,
[17:08.820 --> 17:11.460]  a way to move some medical marijuana patients
[17:11.460 --> 17:12.980]  into recreational pot sales,
[17:12.980 --> 17:15.500]  which are taxed at higher rates than medical pot sales
[17:15.500 --> 17:18.040]  in order to generate valuable tax revenue
[17:18.040 --> 17:19.900]  for state and local governments.
[17:19.900 --> 17:21.660]  The difference between the amount of tax revenue
[17:21.660 --> 17:23.780]  generated by the recreational marijuana
[17:23.780 --> 17:26.100]  versus medical cannabis are stark,
[17:26.100 --> 17:28.840]  as we pointed out last week in a post about RecPot.
[17:28.840 --> 17:31.180]  So yeah, we talked about how much the taxes are.
[17:31.180 --> 17:33.260]  Then they show a graph here
[17:33.260 --> 17:36.680]  that shows state of Colorado medical marijuana sales tax
[17:36.680 --> 17:38.480]  for the month of March.
[17:38.480 --> 17:42.260]  And then it shows, this is medical in Adams County.
[17:42.260 --> 17:43.140]  Let's see, let's find Pueblo.
[17:43.140 --> 17:44.340]  This is where we are.
[17:44.340 --> 17:45.780]  Let's go to Pueblo.
[17:45.780 --> 17:50.780]  They did $14,904 in the month of March.
[17:50.980 --> 17:55.020]  Now let's go down to look at the same thing, Pueblo.
[17:58.280 --> 18:03.280]  The additional 10% sales tax brought in $135,215.
[18:05.020 --> 18:07.060]  So yeah, they just wanna move you right over
[18:07.060 --> 18:08.820]  to that rec market so that you gotta spend
[18:08.820 --> 18:11.420]  that extra $135,000.
[18:11.420 --> 18:13.020]  Yep.
[18:13.020 --> 18:14.300]  Oh, that's rude.
[18:14.300 --> 18:15.300]  That's a dick move.
[18:15.300 --> 18:17.220]  They were working on this three years ago
[18:17.220 --> 18:20.620]  and then they sort of dropped it last year.
[18:20.620 --> 18:22.740]  And the hype was that a whole bunch of people
[18:22.740 --> 18:24.700]  were gonna join the medical marijuana registry
[18:24.700 --> 18:26.300]  to avoid the taxes.
[18:26.300 --> 18:27.380]  And when that didn't happen,
[18:27.380 --> 18:29.580]  they brought up the severe pain number again
[18:29.580 --> 18:32.200]  and said, well, let's push more of those people out.
[18:32.200 --> 18:33.500]  Why don't that?
[18:33.500 --> 18:34.940]  It's part of the data collection.
[18:34.940 --> 18:37.500]  When they saw that the medical marijuana market consumed
[18:37.500 --> 18:41.940]  like 65 or 70% of the $700 million worth of marijuana
[18:41.940 --> 18:44.740]  sold in Colorado last year, they kind of freaked.
[18:44.740 --> 18:48.460]  What they don't get is that rec consumers consume
[18:48.460 --> 18:50.060]  occasionally, recreationally.
[18:50.060 --> 18:52.780]  Medical consumers consume daily for medical reasons.
[18:52.780 --> 18:54.620]  Of course, we're consuming the majority of the meds.
[18:54.620 --> 18:55.700]  Yeah.
[18:55.700 --> 18:57.980]  And that's what this was designed for.
[18:57.980 --> 18:59.220]  I keep going back to this part,
[18:59.220 --> 19:02.380]  but we'd put cannabis on the legal market here
[19:02.380 --> 19:03.380]  for medical patients.
[19:03.380 --> 19:04.780]  That's how the model started.
[19:04.780 --> 19:06.780]  And now that's who we have screwed over.
[19:07.100 --> 19:08.820]  That's who's getting pushed right out of all of this.
[19:08.820 --> 19:09.660]  And that sucks.
[19:09.660 --> 19:11.540]  They're getting attacked from every angle.
[19:11.540 --> 19:13.380]  The state's taking money out of the registry
[19:13.380 --> 19:14.780]  that they're not supposed to access
[19:14.780 --> 19:15.820]  and spending it on stuff
[19:15.820 --> 19:17.620]  they're not supposed to spend it on.
[19:17.620 --> 19:19.180]  They're looking to make it harder
[19:19.180 --> 19:20.860]  to get a extended plant count
[19:20.860 --> 19:24.660]  to get a recommendation for severe pain.
[19:24.660 --> 19:26.340]  They're looking to limit caregivers
[19:26.340 --> 19:27.540]  in a half dozen different ways
[19:27.540 --> 19:28.820]  we're gonna talk about in a little bit.
[19:28.820 --> 19:31.340]  Yeah, we'll talk about that in just a second.
[19:31.340 --> 19:33.940]  It's getting tough to be a medical patient in Colorado
[19:33.940 --> 19:35.980]  if you don't really keep up on your stuff.
[19:36.020 --> 19:37.100]  And it's gonna be especially harder
[19:37.100 --> 19:39.180]  to be a caregiver here pretty soon.
[19:39.180 --> 19:40.620]  All right, I've got another article on the screen.
[19:40.620 --> 19:42.220]  It's very similar to the one that we just read,
[19:42.220 --> 19:44.100]  but it goes on a different direction toward the end.
[19:44.100 --> 19:44.940]  It says-
[19:44.940 --> 19:45.860]  It's about the same law.
[19:45.860 --> 19:48.260]  It's just such a big law that it's,
[19:48.260 --> 19:49.100]  there's several different news articles on it.
[19:49.100 --> 19:51.900]  Yeah, and then we're gonna read part of the new bill.
[19:51.900 --> 19:54.060]  Actually, I have the PDF on my screen.
[19:54.060 --> 19:56.100]  We'll read part of that bill in just a minute too.
[19:56.100 --> 19:57.580]  And the headline alone will be enough
[19:57.580 --> 19:59.500]  to make you understand why we're so frustrated.
[19:59.500 --> 20:01.580]  And we'll read some parts from that bill.
[20:01.580 --> 20:03.340]  So it says, this article is actually written
[20:03.340 --> 20:05.740]  by Kristen Wyatt and I founded on the cannabis.
[20:06.500 --> 20:07.340]  I think Mike sent me a link to this.
[20:07.340 --> 20:08.180]  Thanks for that.
[20:08.180 --> 20:09.220]  That's why I called you to be on the show.
[20:09.220 --> 20:10.060]  Thanks.
[20:10.060 --> 20:11.700]  The headline is Colorado medical pot,
[20:11.700 --> 20:13.980]  new caregiver limits, MMJ in schools,
[20:13.980 --> 20:15.580]  okayed by government.
[20:15.580 --> 20:16.400]  What?
[20:16.400 --> 20:17.240]  Yeah, I'll read it.
[20:17.240 --> 20:18.060]  Don't worry.
[20:18.060 --> 20:19.380]  It says Colorado's governor signed into law
[20:19.380 --> 20:21.380]  a crackdown on medical marijuana, mana.
[20:21.380 --> 20:23.900]  That's a fucking tongue twister.
[20:23.900 --> 20:25.660]  Medical marijuana Monday.
[20:25.660 --> 20:26.500]  That's a whole new,
[20:26.500 --> 20:28.140]  we should just make that something right there.
[20:28.140 --> 20:29.820]  Medical marijuana Mondays, I like that.
[20:29.820 --> 20:30.700]  I'm gonna start over though.
[20:30.700 --> 20:32.540]  Colorado's governor signed into law
[20:32.540 --> 20:34.940]  a crackdown on medical marijuana Monday.
[20:34.940 --> 20:37.460]  One of two measures designed to ferret out people
[20:37.460 --> 20:40.420]  and properly using and selling untaxed marijuana.
[20:40.420 --> 20:42.680]  I think that we need an Oxford comma in this sentence
[20:42.680 --> 20:44.860]  right here after the word marijuana.
[20:44.860 --> 20:45.860]  I think that would fix this.
[20:45.860 --> 20:47.500]  I'm the wrong guy to ask that question.
[20:47.500 --> 20:49.540]  But then it says the law limits caregivers,
[20:49.540 --> 20:52.780]  those who grow pot on behalf of patients to 99 plants.
[20:52.780 --> 20:54.900]  The change means that some high volume caregivers
[20:54.900 --> 20:57.460]  will face the same oversight as commercial growers,
[20:57.460 --> 21:01.060]  paying licensing fees and undergoing background checks.
[21:01.060 --> 21:03.220]  The new rule in Senate 14,
[21:03.220 --> 21:05.060]  Senate Bill 14 have support
[21:05.060 --> 21:06.540]  from the recreational pot industry,
[21:06.540 --> 21:08.220]  which has complained that the light regulation
[21:08.220 --> 21:11.220]  on Colorado's caregivers has invited black market growers
[21:11.220 --> 21:13.380]  who don't face residency requirements,
[21:13.380 --> 21:16.460]  background checks or commercial seed to sale tracking
[21:16.460 --> 21:19.620]  used to ensure pot plants are grown and sold legally.
[21:21.380 --> 21:24.700]  A lot of those people just have to grow cannabis
[21:24.700 --> 21:27.340]  either way, like they're gonna grow their own.
[21:27.340 --> 21:31.500]  Black market production people just do,
[21:31.500 --> 21:32.860]  they have forever.
[21:33.740 --> 21:35.220]  If they're moving here to Colorado,
[21:35.220 --> 21:36.580]  it's to hide amongst the many,
[21:36.580 --> 21:39.940]  like those idiots doing those warehouses in Denver.
[21:39.940 --> 21:41.380]  But they stood out like a sore thumb
[21:41.380 --> 21:43.820]  because they weren't operating legally.
[21:43.820 --> 21:45.380]  And it was clear to everyone around them
[21:45.380 --> 21:46.780]  that they were about to get busted
[21:46.780 --> 21:48.460]  and then they were quickly busted.
[21:50.260 --> 21:53.180]  There's so many things I wanna rant about here.
[21:53.180 --> 21:55.020]  At least one thing that they did that was cool
[21:55.020 --> 21:57.420]  is they left it at 99 plants.
[21:57.420 --> 21:58.320]  If you've got more than that,
[21:58.320 --> 21:59.740]  you're doing something weird anyway.
[21:59.740 --> 22:01.820]  But fees and background checks,
[22:01.820 --> 22:03.220]  we would open our own dispensary
[22:03.220 --> 22:05.260]  if we wanted background checks and fees.
[22:05.260 --> 22:06.620]  That's why we're just a caregiver.
[22:06.620 --> 22:08.780]  We're just low key growing a little bit of cannabis
[22:08.780 --> 22:09.660]  for somebody.
[22:09.660 --> 22:13.820]  Well, and dispensaries make money, caregivers can't.
[22:13.820 --> 22:15.940]  And part of the beauty of the caregiver system
[22:15.940 --> 22:18.020]  is there's a huge number of people in Colorado
[22:18.020 --> 22:21.420]  that can't afford to be spending four or $500 a week
[22:21.420 --> 22:23.460]  on medicine.
[22:23.460 --> 22:24.620]  And without caregivers,
[22:24.620 --> 22:28.100]  I don't know a lot of people that could manage their pain.
[22:28.100 --> 22:29.940]  Yeah, I know several people that would be shit out of luck
[22:29.940 --> 22:31.540]  if I couldn't grow their medicine for them
[22:32.260 --> 22:34.620]  or supply their medicine in some way, shape or form.
[22:34.620 --> 22:36.100]  Yep, no, it's a huge thing.
[22:36.100 --> 22:38.500]  The cost savings when you go through a caregiver
[22:38.500 --> 22:40.220]  is significant over trying to shop
[22:40.220 --> 22:41.660]  and even the medical dispensaries.
[22:41.660 --> 22:43.740]  And getting rid of the caregivers
[22:43.740 --> 22:46.100]  pushes more people into the medical legal system,
[22:46.100 --> 22:49.860]  the shops, and I don't know, I hate this bill so much.
[22:49.860 --> 22:50.700]  Me too, me too.
[22:50.700 --> 22:51.520]  The article goes on to say,
[22:51.520 --> 22:53.040]  we're really trying to make sure that caregivers
[22:53.040 --> 22:54.740]  are part of our regulatory system,
[22:54.740 --> 22:57.540]  said representative Jonathan Singer from Longmont,
[22:57.540 --> 22:59.020]  who sponsored the bill.
[22:59.020 --> 23:00.980]  Caregivers have successfully resisted
[23:00.980 --> 23:02.300]  such limits for years,
[23:02.300 --> 23:04.580]  but the law includes some concessions
[23:04.580 --> 23:06.260]  that won their acceptance.
[23:07.180 --> 23:12.180]  For example, the law eliminates an unenforced requirement
[23:12.900 --> 23:16.220]  that parents of marijuana patients under 18 grow the drug.
[23:16.220 --> 23:17.620]  So that means that now,
[23:17.620 --> 23:19.680]  back in the day, if you were under 18 and you were a patient,
[23:19.680 --> 23:21.060]  your parents had to grow for you,
[23:21.060 --> 23:22.340]  you couldn't assign a caregiver,
[23:22.340 --> 23:24.120]  you couldn't shop at the dispensary.
[23:24.120 --> 23:25.900]  Now that kind of changes the rules there.
[23:25.900 --> 23:27.660]  So that kind of helps.
[23:27.660 --> 23:29.020]  The rule had-
[23:29.060 --> 23:32.060]  Yeah, there's two not horrible parts of this bill,
[23:32.060 --> 23:33.540]  or you could even call them decent,
[23:33.540 --> 23:35.180]  and that's definitely one of them.
[23:35.180 --> 23:36.580]  True, yeah.
[23:36.580 --> 23:38.280]  The rule puts some parents who move to Colorado
[23:38.280 --> 23:39.880]  seeking cannabis treatments for their children
[23:39.880 --> 23:42.060]  outside the law, and now those folks will be legal.
[23:42.060 --> 23:43.500]  So that helps a lot.
[23:43.500 --> 23:47.480]  It also sets up a task force to start work on public access
[23:47.480 --> 23:50.780]  to the state's few marijuana testing labs.
[23:50.780 --> 23:52.820]  So the marijuana industry has generally opposed
[23:52.820 --> 23:55.940]  public access to the labs fearing backlogs, but-
[23:55.940 --> 23:57.180]  That's some horse shit, ain't it?
[23:57.180 --> 23:59.220]  Just let that sentence stick in for a minute.
[23:59.220 --> 24:00.060]  Right, backlogs.
[24:00.060 --> 24:02.620]  The industry is fighting letting caregivers
[24:02.620 --> 24:05.660]  access testing labs because it might take them
[24:05.660 --> 24:07.900]  an extra day to get their test results.
[24:09.380 --> 24:11.660]  And they don't want business?
[24:11.660 --> 24:12.700]  Well, right?
[24:12.700 --> 24:15.580]  Why aren't the labs standing up asking for more business?
[24:15.580 --> 24:17.100]  It just doesn't make any sense.
[24:17.100 --> 24:18.760]  And my medicine needs to be tested
[24:18.760 --> 24:21.260]  just as badly as the dispensary's does,
[24:21.260 --> 24:22.580]  or whoever else's.
[24:22.580 --> 24:23.980]  That dumb rule came down, what,
[24:23.980 --> 24:27.380]  after one batch of tests you got in?
[24:27.380 --> 24:29.780]  Yeah, yeah, I got one or two good batches of testing in
[24:29.780 --> 24:33.180]  before they shut that down so that I couldn't do it anymore.
[24:33.180 --> 24:35.300]  All right, there's so much stuff in this article, you guys.
[24:35.300 --> 24:37.140]  I might skip a couple of paragraphs.
[24:37.140 --> 24:38.580]  Finally, this one is good.
[24:38.580 --> 24:40.420]  The law allows school districts to consider
[24:40.420 --> 24:42.620]  allowing medical marijuana use on campus
[24:42.620 --> 24:44.980]  as long as the pot is administered by a parent
[24:44.980 --> 24:47.700]  or designated medical marijuana professional,
[24:47.700 --> 24:49.900]  not a school nurse.
[24:49.900 --> 24:52.880]  The pot in school's allowance would be the nation's first,
[24:52.880 --> 24:53.720]  though it's not clear
[24:53.720 --> 24:56.040]  how many school districts would participate.
[24:56.040 --> 25:00.320]  Nor would it allow any sort of smoked consumption.
[25:00.320 --> 25:01.160]  Yeah, I didn't think so.
[25:01.160 --> 25:04.160]  It's capsules, oils, tinctures, lotions only.
[25:04.160 --> 25:06.400]  But still, it's a huge step in the right direction.
[25:06.400 --> 25:09.040]  Yeah, well, because a kid that's got ADD
[25:09.040 --> 25:11.000]  or whatever else that requires a medicine.
[25:11.000 --> 25:12.400]  There are hundreds of kids
[25:12.400 --> 25:13.240]  that have moved to Colorado. They go to the nurse
[25:13.240 --> 25:14.060]  and get their pills.
[25:14.060 --> 25:15.500]  Well, I'm just saying, if you take a pill,
[25:15.500 --> 25:16.400]  if you take a prescription,
[25:16.400 --> 25:17.800]  you go to the school nurse after lunch
[25:17.800 --> 25:18.960]  and she gives you your pill.
[25:18.960 --> 25:21.120]  Why can't you just go in there and get your ganja cookie,
[25:21.120 --> 25:23.520]  or your Sweet Stone candy bear or something?
[25:23.520 --> 25:27.480]  They're skirting federal law again and being silly,
[25:27.480 --> 25:30.440]  but it's a step in the right direction at least.
[25:30.440 --> 25:33.120]  It's a very tiny possible step in the right direction,
[25:33.120 --> 25:35.200]  I should say. Small steps, baby steps.
[25:35.200 --> 25:36.040]  It goes on to say,
[25:36.040 --> 25:38.240]  Governor Hickenlooper said the law was a compromise
[25:38.240 --> 25:40.160]  worked out by both political parties
[25:40.160 --> 25:43.280]  and the pot industry and caregivers.
[25:43.280 --> 25:46.360]  The news went apeshit with this particular amendment
[25:46.360 --> 25:47.680]  the last couple of weeks.
[25:47.680 --> 25:50.840]  Pot in schools, the anti-pot people had a big hit.
[25:51.440 --> 25:54.080]  Yeah, that's even, I'm in the cannabis industry.
[25:54.080 --> 25:56.000]  I've seen this since the beginning.
[25:56.000 --> 25:56.840]  We had a shot.
[25:56.840 --> 25:58.440]  Mike was the bud tender and I was the manager
[25:58.440 --> 26:00.960]  at the very first dispensary in this little town.
[26:00.960 --> 26:03.360]  And I'm still surprised they're gonna let the kids
[26:03.360 --> 26:05.840]  use their edibles or whatever in school.
[26:05.840 --> 26:07.760]  That's just, that's revolutionary.
[26:07.760 --> 26:10.400]  We've literally had hundreds of kids move to Colorado
[26:10.400 --> 26:12.440]  to access this as a medication
[26:12.440 --> 26:15.600]  and all of them have to go to school.
[26:15.600 --> 26:18.120]  It's just one of the things that we need to find
[26:18.120 --> 26:19.840]  a good workaround for.
[26:19.840 --> 26:21.240]  I hope this works.
[26:21.240 --> 26:22.720]  It's a big step.
[26:22.720 --> 26:23.640]  It's a pretty good reflection
[26:23.640 --> 26:25.560]  of what the community wants Hickenlooper said.
[26:25.560 --> 26:27.720]  If the law doesn't require caregivers
[26:27.720 --> 26:29.680]  to register their growing operations,
[26:29.680 --> 26:32.640]  instead it encourages them to register by assuring them
[26:32.640 --> 26:34.960]  that authorities could verify their number of plants
[26:34.960 --> 26:37.240]  without starting a criminal investigation
[26:37.240 --> 26:39.600]  instead of forcing caregivers to prove in court
[26:39.600 --> 26:42.000]  that their operation is legal.
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.580]  That sort of makes sense, but it also seems,
[26:45.960 --> 26:47.560]  haven't we seen this move before?
[26:47.560 --> 26:49.760]  Like all of you folk of a certain type
[26:50.600 --> 26:52.080]  need to register so that we know where all of you are,
[26:52.080 --> 26:54.520]  that when we want to round all of those certain folk up,
[26:54.520 --> 26:55.960]  we know where they are.
[26:55.960 --> 26:59.760]  Right, it's a really backwards provision
[26:59.760 --> 27:04.520]  where they're saying to keep from looking guilty,
[27:04.520 --> 27:07.520]  stand up and prove you're innocent first.
[27:07.520 --> 27:10.480]  And any caregiver who's operating legally
[27:10.480 --> 27:14.880]  answers the cop at the door with a binder full of paperwork.
[27:14.880 --> 27:18.840]  And if the cop can add, there's no difficult questions.
[27:18.880 --> 27:20.440]  We're lucky because of where we live.
[27:20.440 --> 27:21.720]  The cops will come and they'll say,
[27:21.720 --> 27:22.560]  you grow weed here?
[27:22.560 --> 27:24.120]  And you go, yeah, I got a couple of plants.
[27:24.120 --> 27:25.040]  And they'll go, you got a medical card?
[27:25.040 --> 27:25.880]  And you go, yeah.
[27:25.880 --> 27:27.800]  And they go, okay, I've got so much other shit to do.
[27:27.800 --> 27:28.640]  You guys have a good day.
[27:28.640 --> 27:30.080]  Don't stab anybody.
[27:30.080 --> 27:31.020]  Then they leave.
[27:31.020 --> 27:32.760]  But for people in other towns, yeah.
[27:32.760 --> 27:35.040]  That maybe if you've got,
[27:35.040 --> 27:38.120]  if you're in like a nice residential area
[27:38.120 --> 27:39.400]  and you stank it out,
[27:39.400 --> 27:41.200]  maybe it'd be a good idea just to go register,
[27:41.200 --> 27:42.760]  just to be proactive.
[27:42.760 --> 27:44.440]  Now that this bill has been passed,
[27:44.440 --> 27:45.720]  it would be a good idea.
[27:45.720 --> 27:47.560]  And they required if you're doing more
[27:47.560 --> 27:49.560]  than six plant minimums.
[27:49.560 --> 27:51.560]  You guys are gonna have to read this bill.
[27:51.560 --> 27:52.520]  If you're a caregiver,
[27:52.520 --> 27:55.720]  you need to hop online and download the PDF of this bill
[27:55.720 --> 27:57.520]  and read every word.
[27:57.520 --> 27:58.360]  It's short.
[27:58.360 --> 27:59.360]  So don't be intimidated.
[27:59.360 --> 28:00.200]  Just read it.
[28:00.200 --> 28:01.080]  Yep. Just do it.
[28:01.080 --> 28:02.520]  Get yourself a little pen and paper,
[28:02.520 --> 28:04.800]  make some bullet points of what you've got to do now.
[28:04.800 --> 28:07.480]  So Hickenlooper signed the measure
[28:07.480 --> 28:09.240]  at a Denver police station to show goodwill
[28:09.240 --> 28:11.200]  between law enforcement and caregivers.
[28:11.200 --> 28:12.840]  The language in the law came after years
[28:12.840 --> 28:14.000]  of testing negotiations
[28:14.000 --> 28:16.920]  between medical marijuana groups and police.
[28:16.920 --> 28:18.520]  There are good reasons for all sides
[28:18.520 --> 28:21.200]  to not trust each other, said Terry Robnett,
[28:21.200 --> 28:22.960]  head of the Cannabis Patients Alliance
[28:22.960 --> 28:24.800]  who helped negotiate the language.
[28:24.800 --> 28:26.120]  The governor has yet to sign
[28:26.120 --> 28:27.800]  the other medical marijuana law.
[28:29.160 --> 28:31.640]  That measure updates marijuana regulations
[28:31.640 --> 28:33.780]  that were written before Colorado made pot legal
[28:33.780 --> 28:36.160]  for adults in 2012.
[28:37.660 --> 28:39.520]  So there's a lot of stuff going on in this bill
[28:39.520 --> 28:40.820]  like we were saying, you guys.
[28:40.820 --> 28:41.760]  I'm gonna find the bill.
[28:41.760 --> 28:42.600]  I've got it on my,
[28:42.600 --> 28:43.560]  I've got the PDF here.
[28:43.560 --> 28:45.240]  I'm gonna open it up.
[28:45.240 --> 28:46.800]  There are a couple of things that really got mics
[28:47.480 --> 28:49.280]  attention and my attention.
[28:49.280 --> 28:53.040]  It starts off and it says,
[28:53.040 --> 28:54.120]  a bill for an act.
[28:54.120 --> 28:57.160]  The headline is concerning marijuana issues
[28:57.160 --> 29:00.400]  that are not regulated by the department of revenue.
[29:00.400 --> 29:01.320]  So they're basically,
[29:01.320 --> 29:03.600]  they're starting off by saying money.
[29:03.600 --> 29:06.080]  This is shit that we're not getting money from.
[29:06.080 --> 29:08.480]  Here's money swimming by that we're not catching.
[29:08.480 --> 29:09.840]  That's what it sounds like they're saying to me.
[29:09.840 --> 29:13.280]  These are the people we can't monitor and overtax.
[29:13.280 --> 29:16.620]  And here are the ways we've found to rectify that.
[29:17.620 --> 29:18.840]  So the first part is marijuana revenue.
[29:18.840 --> 29:21.000]  Okay, this bill requires the Colorado medical board
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.620]  to adopt rules regarding guidelines for physicians
[29:23.620 --> 29:25.760]  who make medical marijuana recommendations
[29:25.760 --> 29:28.800]  for patients suffering from severe pain.
[29:28.800 --> 29:32.280]  They wanna find a new way to figure out
[29:32.280 --> 29:34.560]  if you really hurt or not.
[29:34.560 --> 29:37.520]  Yep, they've decided that your doctor
[29:37.520 --> 29:41.000]  isn't qualified to believe you
[29:41.000 --> 29:44.240]  and you're not qualified to tell your doctor what hurts.
[29:44.240 --> 29:46.720]  And so they're gonna come up with a little sheet
[29:47.560 --> 29:49.760]  or some paperwork so that the doctor can verify
[29:49.760 --> 29:51.740]  that you really do hurt.
[29:51.740 --> 29:54.920]  And you can verify that your doctor is sure that you hurt.
[29:54.920 --> 29:56.800]  It's asinine.
[29:56.800 --> 29:58.480]  Yeah, it hurts, trust me.
[29:58.480 --> 29:59.300]  Yep.
[29:59.300 --> 30:00.920]  I wouldn't say it hurts if it didn't.
[30:00.920 --> 30:02.880]  It goes on, it says the bill requires
[30:02.880 --> 30:04.720]  Colorado medical board to adopt rules
[30:04.720 --> 30:06.400]  regarding guidelines for, no wait,
[30:06.400 --> 30:07.560]  I already read that, here we go.
[30:07.560 --> 30:09.320]  It requires the state agency to adopt rules
[30:09.320 --> 30:11.280]  regarding guidelines for primary caregivers
[30:11.280 --> 30:13.360]  to give informed consent to patients
[30:13.360 --> 30:15.200]  that the product they cultivate or produce
[30:15.200 --> 30:16.760]  may contain contaminants
[30:16.760 --> 30:20.460]  and that the levels of THC are not verified.
[30:20.460 --> 30:23.880]  So, hey Mike, as your caregiver, did you hear all that?
[30:23.880 --> 30:24.720]  I did.
[30:24.720 --> 30:26.160]  I haven't tested any of this.
[30:26.160 --> 30:28.640]  That's what the warning label on my last pickup says.
[30:28.640 --> 30:31.480]  I am giving you informed consent to my patient
[30:31.480 --> 30:33.360]  that the product I have cultivated or produced
[30:33.360 --> 30:35.440]  may contain contaminants
[30:35.440 --> 30:37.520]  and that the THC levels are not verified.
[30:39.200 --> 30:41.840]  Yeah, I didn't put any contaminants on there.
[30:41.840 --> 30:44.120]  I knew that because I watched the state
[30:44.120 --> 30:47.100]  take away your right to verify your THC levels.
[30:48.400 --> 30:50.960]  Yeah, well, we got it back now with this bill, at least.
[30:50.960 --> 30:52.720]  They're gonna put together a group of people
[30:52.720 --> 30:55.180]  to decide how and if you get access.
[30:55.180 --> 30:56.520]  It's not quite the same thing.
[30:56.520 --> 30:58.200]  Yeah, if I get access.
[30:58.200 --> 30:59.040]  Yep.
[30:59.040 --> 30:59.860]  Can we let him play?
[30:59.860 --> 31:00.700]  It's a big if.
[31:00.700 --> 31:02.520]  So the bill requires all primary caregivers
[31:02.520 --> 31:04.600]  to register with the state,
[31:04.600 --> 31:05.640]  with the state health agency
[31:05.640 --> 31:08.200]  and the state medical marijuana licensing authority.
[31:08.200 --> 31:11.000]  Any primary caregiver who is not registered
[31:11.000 --> 31:12.600]  shall register within 10 days
[31:12.600 --> 31:14.720]  of being informed of the duty to register.
[31:14.720 --> 31:17.200]  If a person fails to register after such 10 days,
[31:17.200 --> 31:19.960]  the state health agency and licensing authority
[31:19.960 --> 31:22.280]  shall prohibit the person from ever registering
[31:22.280 --> 31:24.640]  and acting as a primary caregiver.
[31:24.640 --> 31:25.480]  Yep.
[31:25.480 --> 31:28.640]  They didn't have a stick to whack at you
[31:28.640 --> 31:30.320]  with some of their other rules.
[31:30.320 --> 31:33.600]  So now if they catch you as an unregistered caregiver,
[31:33.600 --> 31:35.220]  they're gonna give you 10 days.
[31:35.220 --> 31:37.480]  And if you don't register in 10 days,
[31:37.480 --> 31:39.460]  you can't ever caregive again.
[31:39.460 --> 31:40.360]  Where do I do that?
[31:40.360 --> 31:42.080]  It doesn't even tell me how or where to do that.
[31:42.520 --> 31:44.000]  You have to require with the state health agency.
[31:44.000 --> 31:46.080]  If you go to the MED website,
[31:46.080 --> 31:50.400]  you can download the voluntary registry form
[31:50.400 --> 31:51.800]  that they've had up there for a while.
[31:51.800 --> 31:53.640]  I don't know that they've put a new form up.
[31:53.640 --> 31:55.840]  So when this is signed into action, right?
[31:55.840 --> 31:56.680]  This is legit.
[31:56.680 --> 31:57.520]  This got signed Monday.
[31:57.520 --> 31:59.720]  So all caregivers, you guys have 10 days.
[31:59.720 --> 32:02.480]  By the time this episode comes out, we'll all be fucked.
[32:02.480 --> 32:04.540]  We'll know the 10 day time limit is like
[32:04.540 --> 32:06.160]  if a cop comes to your door and goes,
[32:06.160 --> 32:07.320]  are you a caregiver?
[32:07.320 --> 32:08.720]  And you go, yeah.
[32:08.720 --> 32:10.400]  And he goes, are you registered?
[32:10.400 --> 32:11.800]  And you go, no.
[32:12.640 --> 32:13.880]  Now you've got 10 days.
[32:13.880 --> 32:14.720]  All right.
[32:15.680 --> 32:20.680]  Or if the MED decides to mail all you guys letters saying,
[32:20.760 --> 32:23.400]  this is gonna be received on the first or whatever,
[32:23.400 --> 32:24.580]  then you've got 10 days.
[32:24.580 --> 32:27.120]  They could fully pull that too and call that notice.
[32:27.120 --> 32:28.400]  Wow.
[32:28.400 --> 32:29.240]  All right.
[32:29.240 --> 32:30.780]  The bill requires the licensing authority
[32:30.780 --> 32:33.160]  and the state health agency to share a minimum amount
[32:33.160 --> 32:34.980]  of information necessary to ensure
[32:34.980 --> 32:37.880]  that a medical marijuana patient has only one caregiver
[32:37.880 --> 32:39.680]  and is not using a primary caregiver
[32:39.680 --> 32:41.660]  and a medical marijuana center.
[32:43.240 --> 32:44.200]  That makes sense.
[32:44.200 --> 32:45.020]  Yep.
[32:45.020 --> 32:46.920]  Yeah, because if I'm a caregiver
[32:46.920 --> 32:48.240]  and I take good care of my patients,
[32:48.240 --> 32:50.200]  you guys get, you get love.
[32:50.200 --> 32:53.400]  And any caregiver should be hooking up their patients
[32:53.400 --> 32:54.960]  a little bit, give them some stuff, take care of them,
[32:54.960 --> 32:55.800]  make sure they're not hurting.
[32:55.800 --> 32:57.000]  If they come over and like my back hurts,
[32:57.000 --> 32:59.400]  you get out a fat dab of CBD and you fuck them up.
[32:59.400 --> 33:00.240]  Right.
[33:01.440 --> 33:03.640]  And also that caregiver or that patient
[33:03.640 --> 33:05.640]  should not be going to another caregiver
[33:05.640 --> 33:07.160]  and getting love from two people
[33:07.160 --> 33:08.600]  and spoiling the whole game.
[33:08.600 --> 33:09.440]  Right.
[33:09.440 --> 33:10.800]  Or signed up with multiple people.
[33:10.800 --> 33:12.560]  There were a lot of shop hoppers
[33:12.560 --> 33:16.280]  when shops were still able to do sign with us and get blah.
[33:16.280 --> 33:17.120]  Yeah.
[33:17.120 --> 33:17.960]  People would just go from shop to shop
[33:17.960 --> 33:19.360]  and sign up with aid in a day.
[33:19.360 --> 33:20.200]  Yep.
[33:20.200 --> 33:21.560]  And then get all kinds of free shit.
[33:21.560 --> 33:23.600]  And each shop would be under the assumption
[33:23.600 --> 33:24.920]  that they were growing your six.
[33:24.920 --> 33:26.280]  And so it led to some issues.
[33:26.280 --> 33:27.120]  So.
[33:27.120 --> 33:28.440]  Then here's another fund bill, a fund bill.
[33:28.440 --> 33:30.360]  It says this bill permits money,
[33:30.360 --> 33:33.360]  monies in the marijuana tax fund to be used
[33:33.360 --> 33:36.260]  to fund the implementation of any bills approved
[33:36.300 --> 33:39.740]  by the marijuana revenues interim committee.
[33:39.740 --> 33:42.580]  So all of the marijuana tax money,
[33:42.580 --> 33:44.940]  they want to, now they will be able to use that
[33:44.940 --> 33:48.740]  to implement all of the bills approved by the committee.
[33:48.740 --> 33:49.980]  That's kind of some bullshit.
[33:49.980 --> 33:52.940]  Later in the bill, they dole out a couple of hundred grand
[33:52.940 --> 33:55.060]  to random stuff that was never approved.
[33:56.260 --> 33:58.780]  It's just fugly from here on out, folks.
[33:58.780 --> 34:00.140]  Sorry for the downer.
[34:01.940 --> 34:02.780]  Yeah.
[34:02.780 --> 34:03.900]  Which, what do we want to read?
[34:03.900 --> 34:05.300]  There were a couple of things in this.
[34:05.300 --> 34:07.740]  Which one do you want to hit on?
[34:07.740 --> 34:10.780]  Just a couple of bullet points on caregivers.
[34:10.780 --> 34:13.160]  You're limited to 36 plants.
[34:13.160 --> 34:15.900]  That's five plants or five patients,
[34:15.900 --> 34:19.020]  six plants per patient, plus your own six, 36.
[34:20.020 --> 34:22.580]  Unless you special register all
[34:22.580 --> 34:24.340]  of your extended plant count cards,
[34:24.340 --> 34:28.060]  which in which case you can grow up to 99.
[34:28.060 --> 34:30.260]  After 99 plants, you have to become
[34:30.260 --> 34:32.260]  a licensed marijuana business,
[34:32.260 --> 34:34.300]  which requires buying a building
[34:34.340 --> 34:36.540]  and business permits.
[34:36.540 --> 34:38.440]  So keep it under 99 people.
[34:40.140 --> 34:42.380]  The nastiest little paragraph I saw
[34:42.380 --> 34:44.980]  that I haven't seen any of the news pick up yet
[34:44.980 --> 34:47.420]  is it bans caregivers from working
[34:47.420 --> 34:50.380]  for medical or rec shops in any way.
[34:50.380 --> 34:51.420]  You can't be an owner.
[34:51.420 --> 34:53.220]  You can't be an employee.
[34:53.220 --> 34:56.380]  You can't even visit limited access areas
[34:56.380 --> 34:59.440]  as a visitor or a guest or on a tour.
[34:59.440 --> 35:00.280]  Yeah.
[35:00.280 --> 35:02.740]  That's something I'm looking for right now.
[35:02.780 --> 35:04.700]  Looking for that part.
[35:04.700 --> 35:05.920]  I can pull it up on my phone.
[35:05.920 --> 35:07.760]  I took a picture of that paragraph.
[35:09.620 --> 35:10.460]  Yeah.
[35:13.420 --> 35:15.300]  I've got it here.
[35:15.300 --> 35:17.420]  Yeah, go ahead and give it a read.
[35:17.420 --> 35:18.740]  All right.
[35:18.740 --> 35:20.660]  In order to be a primary caregiver
[35:20.660 --> 35:23.580]  who cultivates medical marijuana for his or her patients
[35:23.580 --> 35:26.640]  or transports medical marijuana for his or her patients,
[35:27.620 --> 35:30.820]  he or she shall also register the locate of...
[35:32.860 --> 35:33.780]  Is that the wrong paragraph?
[35:33.780 --> 35:34.620]  Nope.
[35:34.620 --> 35:36.700]  As a primary caregiver, if he or she is a licensed
[35:36.700 --> 35:41.700]  as a medical marijuana business associate director in part
[35:43.020 --> 35:45.820]  as listed under article, there's a lot of numbers in here.
[35:49.360 --> 35:51.760]  Primary caregiver can't be an employee,
[35:51.760 --> 35:55.160]  contractor or other support staff employee,
[35:55.160 --> 35:59.520]  an owner, a licensed entity pursuant to article 43.3
[35:59.600 --> 36:04.440]  or 43.4 of title 12 Colorado revised statute
[36:04.440 --> 36:08.000]  or working in having access to a restricted
[36:08.000 --> 36:13.000]  or a licensed premise pursuant to article 43.3.
[36:14.000 --> 36:16.340]  Sorry guys, I'm terrible at reading aloud.
[36:16.340 --> 36:18.980]  But basically what that says is primary caregivers
[36:18.980 --> 36:23.980]  cannot work in any rec or medical shops period
[36:24.160 --> 36:26.240]  under any sort of badge.
[36:26.240 --> 36:27.840]  So if you've got an MED badge
[36:27.840 --> 36:30.100]  and you go to work at a dispensary,
[36:30.100 --> 36:32.620]  you can no longer grow your own medicine.
[36:32.620 --> 36:34.760]  You can no longer grow somebody else's medicine.
[36:34.760 --> 36:35.680]  Well, you could grow your own,
[36:35.680 --> 36:37.480]  but you can't be a caregiver for anybody.
[36:37.480 --> 36:40.200]  You can just grow your own, but you can't, I couldn't.
[36:40.200 --> 36:41.800]  Yeah, there's a paragraph in here that says
[36:41.800 --> 36:45.000]  they can't stop you from growing and your rec plants
[36:45.000 --> 36:48.560]  or your own personal six medical plants.
[36:48.560 --> 36:50.400]  But you cannot be a caregiver anymore.
[36:50.400 --> 36:51.240]  Nope.
[36:51.240 --> 36:52.240]  So if you are a caregiver right now
[36:52.240 --> 36:53.920]  and you work at a dispensary,
[36:53.920 --> 36:55.140]  you've got to figure something out.
[36:55.140 --> 36:55.980]  How long do they have?
[36:55.980 --> 36:57.240]  I mean, this bill went into effect.
[36:57.800 --> 36:59.800]  I mean, people had plants growing.
[36:59.800 --> 37:03.040]  Technically it was signed into law on Monday.
[37:03.040 --> 37:05.160]  I'm pretty sure it took effect on Monday.
[37:05.160 --> 37:07.240]  It might be like a six month grace period or something.
[37:07.240 --> 37:08.520]  Yeah, we need some sort of time, you guys.
[37:08.520 --> 37:12.720]  You can't just say, hey, you have to find a new way of life.
[37:12.720 --> 37:14.480]  I honestly haven't seen anyone else
[37:14.480 --> 37:16.200]  talk about this section of the bill.
[37:16.200 --> 37:18.800]  So I'm not sure the implications of it
[37:18.800 --> 37:20.880]  and what that's gonna do throughout the industry
[37:20.880 --> 37:23.600]  has really been considered by anybody but the two of us.
[37:23.600 --> 37:25.320]  Can I cut and paste all of this bill
[37:25.320 --> 37:26.560]  into the notes of this show?
[37:26.800 --> 37:28.960]  Is there some sort of, is that legal?
[37:28.960 --> 37:30.480]  You could link it, I'm sure.
[37:30.480 --> 37:31.880]  Okay, we'll do that.
[37:31.880 --> 37:33.400]  We'll put this into the show notes, you guys,
[37:33.400 --> 37:35.140]  so that you can read it too.
[37:35.140 --> 37:36.440]  The part that really pisses me off
[37:36.440 --> 37:38.560]  is the part about being a primary caregiver
[37:38.560 --> 37:39.780]  and working in a store.
[37:39.780 --> 37:42.080]  I've been bragging on this show for months now
[37:42.080 --> 37:45.380]  that I have become the master grower at the spot dispensary.
[37:45.380 --> 37:47.340]  And the time is coming, it's very near.
[37:48.480 --> 37:51.360]  I haven't actually,
[37:51.360 --> 37:52.960]  can't call myself a full-on employee yet
[37:52.960 --> 37:55.240]  because they haven't paid me yet for my salary
[37:55.240 --> 37:56.960]  because it's not time for that yet.
[37:56.960 --> 37:58.440]  Like they don't have the building done
[37:58.440 --> 37:59.280]  that you're gonna work in yet.
[37:59.280 --> 38:01.080]  It's damn close, buddy.
[38:01.080 --> 38:02.320]  Word, word that-
[38:02.320 --> 38:04.600]  I saw pictures a couple of weeks ago, it looks real close.
[38:04.600 --> 38:06.000]  Yeah, I've been in there a lot lately,
[38:06.000 --> 38:07.840]  giving advice and helping them set things up
[38:07.840 --> 38:09.080]  and telling them where to put things
[38:09.080 --> 38:10.480]  and kind of doing this and doing that.
[38:10.480 --> 38:11.320]  And getting ready.
[38:11.320 --> 38:12.200]  I'm getting excited too.
[38:12.200 --> 38:13.920]  Yeah, so I gotta figure this out.
[38:13.920 --> 38:14.760]  I know a solution,
[38:14.760 --> 38:17.360]  but I hope everybody else has a solution.
[38:17.360 --> 38:19.440]  Right, a lot of people are gonna have to scramble.
[38:19.440 --> 38:20.620]  Yeah, I'm lucky.
[38:21.480 --> 38:22.760]  Joe loves me, I've been blessed.
[38:22.760 --> 38:24.200]  I had a solution before this came up.
[38:24.200 --> 38:25.360]  I didn't even know this was coming.
[38:25.360 --> 38:26.720]  So I thought I hit on accident,
[38:26.720 --> 38:28.280]  didn't know that was why I had that idea.
[38:28.280 --> 38:30.440]  There's a lot of people that are gonna have to scramble.
[38:30.440 --> 38:33.240]  I know a half dozen people in your position already
[38:33.240 --> 38:36.480]  that they work in a shop eight hours a day
[38:36.480 --> 38:38.920]  and they care give on their free time
[38:38.920 --> 38:40.520]  because they have forever.
[38:40.520 --> 38:42.680]  Caregivers are what brought this whole thing
[38:42.680 --> 38:43.720]  to where it is now.
[38:43.720 --> 38:45.320]  That's how I learned how to do what I do so well.
[38:45.320 --> 38:47.000]  It's where the shop wanted me.
[38:47.000 --> 38:50.680]  Caregivers were the medical marijuana industry in Colorado
[38:50.680 --> 38:54.000]  from 2000 to 2008, period.
[38:54.760 --> 38:55.600]  There weren't shops.
[38:55.600 --> 38:56.800]  If you were a medical marijuana patient,
[38:56.800 --> 38:58.400]  it's because you knew a caregiver
[38:58.400 --> 39:00.080]  and it developed a great relationship.
[39:00.080 --> 39:02.280]  Yep, the caregivers were the ones back in the day
[39:02.280 --> 39:05.080]  taking a lot of the medicine to the shops.
[39:05.080 --> 39:07.680]  That's part of what we knew that we had to get.
[39:07.680 --> 39:10.360]  That's where the inventory came from up until like 2010.
[39:10.360 --> 39:13.240]  Right, yeah, that's most of the inventory at the shop
[39:13.240 --> 39:16.520]  Mike and I had was grown either in my old basement
[39:16.520 --> 39:19.120]  in that house in the old part of town over there
[39:19.120 --> 39:20.760]  or from other friends of mine
[39:20.760 --> 39:21.840]  that were doing the same damn thing.
[39:21.840 --> 39:22.760]  Remember that crazy old guy
[39:22.760 --> 39:24.160]  that used to come and bring his product?
[39:24.160 --> 39:26.640]  Yep, in the short time I was there,
[39:26.640 --> 39:28.160]  I saw a half dozen different people
[39:28.160 --> 39:29.680]  walk in with the shoulder bag
[39:29.680 --> 39:32.720]  and the terrified look asking to talk to the manager.
[39:32.720 --> 39:34.080]  Yep, yep, and then they got to come back
[39:34.080 --> 39:36.080]  in a little back room and show me their product.
[39:36.080 --> 39:37.800]  That's where I met the guy with the Hindu Kush.
[39:37.800 --> 39:40.520]  That's where I met the guy with the Alaskan Thunderfuck.
[39:40.520 --> 39:42.080]  We found a lot of friends.
[39:42.080 --> 39:43.680]  My phone is still full of contacts
[39:43.680 --> 39:45.680]  I made running that counter.
[39:45.680 --> 39:48.320]  I run into people from there all over town
[39:48.320 --> 39:50.760]  and there's always that weird moment of eye contact.
[39:50.760 --> 39:53.640]  Where do I know, where are I?
[39:53.640 --> 39:56.600]  Yeah, that's where I know you from.
[39:56.600 --> 39:59.080]  All right, guys, I really encourage you to go read this bill.
[39:59.080 --> 40:02.960]  It's SB15-014.
[40:02.960 --> 40:04.920]  If you're a Colorado medical marijuana patient
[40:04.920 --> 40:09.440]  in Colorado, fucking recreational cannabis consumer,
[40:09.440 --> 40:12.240]  if you're listening to the show, this bill applies to you.
[40:12.240 --> 40:13.920]  You need to check it out, you need to read it.
[40:13.920 --> 40:15.320]  If you've ever thought of growing plants,
[40:15.320 --> 40:17.160]  this is something you need to read right now.
[40:17.160 --> 40:18.400]  It's gonna change everything.
[40:18.440 --> 40:20.520]  If you're far away and wondering
[40:20.520 --> 40:22.760]  what any of this has to do with you,
[40:23.600 --> 40:25.600]  this is what happens when the community
[40:25.600 --> 40:28.200]  doesn't stand up and speak for itself.
[40:28.200 --> 40:31.040]  Is it gets railroaded and stuff like this.
[40:31.040 --> 40:32.520]  That's what I said at the beginning of the show.
[40:32.520 --> 40:34.040]  Right down our throats.
[40:34.040 --> 40:36.320]  I didn't even know that this shit was coming up to vote on.
[40:36.320 --> 40:38.440]  I didn't know that, I didn't know.
[40:38.440 --> 40:41.000]  No, I watched it come, I watched it work its way
[40:41.000 --> 40:43.040]  through the Colorado process
[40:43.040 --> 40:46.040]  and I watched people argue and fight.
[40:46.080 --> 40:48.520]  I read the articles and sent the emails
[40:48.520 --> 40:51.600]  and it just, there was some progress.
[40:51.600 --> 40:54.080]  The original bill was a lot worse.
[40:54.080 --> 40:56.240]  Yeah, I remember you saying that.
[40:56.240 --> 40:57.640]  Well, I'm cool, calm and collected right now
[40:57.640 --> 40:59.520]  but I've got some things to change in my life
[40:59.520 --> 41:00.600]  because of this bill.
[41:00.600 --> 41:03.400]  Oh, half of me wants to scream and smash
[41:03.400 --> 41:04.880]  because this is really, really ugly
[41:04.880 --> 41:06.640]  and it's gonna do a lot of harm.
[41:06.640 --> 41:08.200]  Yeah, don't worry.
[41:08.200 --> 41:09.840]  There's a solution to everything on our end.
[41:09.840 --> 41:11.280]  I know what we're gonna do already.
[41:11.280 --> 41:12.360]  Oh, I'm not worried about you.
[41:12.360 --> 41:14.280]  I'm worried about the three or four.
[41:14.320 --> 41:16.680]  I mean, there's like 4,000 caregivers in Colorado.
[41:16.680 --> 41:20.360]  I'm gonna guess that 2,000 of them work in dispensaries.
[41:20.360 --> 41:23.840]  I mean, there's definitely 4,000 caregivers in Colorado.
[41:23.840 --> 41:27.240]  The 2,000 is kind of a guess, but still that's 2,000 people
[41:27.240 --> 41:29.920]  that either have to come up with a sketchy workaround
[41:29.920 --> 41:32.840]  or quit their job, one or the other.
[41:32.840 --> 41:34.440]  Do you wanna fire the five people
[41:34.440 --> 41:36.680]  you're providing medication and caregiving for
[41:36.680 --> 41:39.920]  or do you wanna quit your day job that's your income?
[41:39.920 --> 41:42.400]  Because you can't make money being a caregiver.
[41:43.080 --> 41:43.920]  That's how-
[41:43.920 --> 41:44.760]  You can recoup your bills,
[41:44.760 --> 41:46.760]  but that's not the same thing as getting paid.
[41:46.760 --> 41:48.560]  The day job funds the caregiving.
[41:48.560 --> 41:49.400]  Right.
[41:49.400 --> 41:50.960]  Like without the day job, you can't afford to caregive
[41:50.960 --> 41:52.880]  because you're given, you gotta pay for the lights.
[41:52.880 --> 41:54.200]  If you need a new gear,
[41:54.200 --> 41:55.720]  could your patients come up with that money?
[41:55.720 --> 41:56.680]  No, do you got money?
[41:56.680 --> 41:57.960]  If I blew a light bulb right now,
[41:57.960 --> 42:00.040]  do you have 200 bucks to replace a bulb?
[42:00.040 --> 42:00.880]  No.
[42:00.880 --> 42:01.800]  Yeah, that comes out of my pocket.
[42:01.800 --> 42:02.640]  Every time I replace the bulbs-
[42:02.640 --> 42:05.040]  Let's go sell my car real quick and buy you a bulb.
[42:05.040 --> 42:07.000]  I got a transmission we're trying to replace right now, dude.
[42:07.000 --> 42:08.760]  Let's not talk about replacing shit.
[42:08.760 --> 42:09.720]  Right.
[42:09.720 --> 42:10.680]  Shout out to Robert.
[42:10.680 --> 42:12.440]  Shout out to Dave.
[42:12.440 --> 42:13.280]  They know why.
[42:14.520 --> 42:16.760]  Yeah, shout out to Dario's.
[42:16.760 --> 42:18.960]  Getting that transmission fixed.
[42:18.960 --> 42:20.240]  Dude, we got like 42 minutes.
[42:20.240 --> 42:21.080]  You got anything you wanna say
[42:21.080 --> 42:23.080]  and we'll start wrapping up the show?
[42:23.080 --> 42:26.360]  Register to vote and start paying attention to politics
[42:26.360 --> 42:29.200]  and hopefully we can stop getting
[42:29.200 --> 42:31.160]  just fucked as a community like this.
[42:31.160 --> 42:32.440]  And then go vote.
[42:32.440 --> 42:33.280]  You gotta vote.
[42:34.440 --> 42:35.560]  There's an election this year.
[42:35.560 --> 42:37.160]  Everybody's talking about 2016
[42:37.160 --> 42:39.180]  and who's gonna be the next president.
[42:39.180 --> 42:42.180]  There's an election between now and then
[42:42.180 --> 42:43.900]  that no one's really talking about.
[42:43.900 --> 42:45.340]  Here in Pueblo, it's real important.
[42:45.340 --> 42:48.220]  We're gonna be voting on rec shops in the city.
[42:48.220 --> 42:49.860]  You told me that I kinda messed up
[42:49.860 --> 42:51.740]  the last report I said on that.
[42:51.740 --> 42:53.660]  Correct me because I don't wanna be wrong on the show.
[42:53.660 --> 42:56.780]  It was episode 69 or 70, I don't remember which,
[42:56.780 --> 43:00.900]  when you covered, recently the Pueblo City Council voted
[43:00.900 --> 43:04.620]  not to license rec shops in the city and they punted.
[43:04.620 --> 43:07.300]  So now the voters are gonna decide
[43:07.300 --> 43:10.500]  on some marijuana question or another in November.
[43:10.500 --> 43:11.700]  The City Council has no idea
[43:11.700 --> 43:12.780]  what they're gonna ask the voters.
[43:12.780 --> 43:15.540]  It's not gonna be the 11 page nonsense ordinance
[43:15.540 --> 43:18.040]  they didn't vote on last Monday.
[43:18.040 --> 43:19.940]  So hopefully it'll be a short and sweet,
[43:19.940 --> 43:22.780]  do we want rec stores in the city, yes or no?
[43:22.780 --> 43:24.220]  But who knows?
[43:24.220 --> 43:25.820]  When I asked City Council directly,
[43:25.820 --> 43:28.060]  I got a snarky response from one of them saying,
[43:28.060 --> 43:30.060]  show up to those meetings and find out.
[43:31.860 --> 43:35.120]  Before I've said I'm impartial to rec stores in the city,
[43:35.120 --> 43:36.260]  but bring it on.
[43:36.260 --> 43:37.700]  We need a rec store in our city.
[43:37.700 --> 43:39.420]  We need those jobs and taxes, period.
[43:39.420 --> 43:44.420]  Pueblo is a poor city full of poor people who need jobs.
[43:45.060 --> 43:46.940]  Yeah, and if you can give us 12 jobs
[43:46.940 --> 43:50.020]  by opening a dispensary, that's 12 people.
[43:50.020 --> 43:51.300]  And that's something I've noticed,
[43:51.300 --> 43:54.060]  that people our age, the 24 to 35 range
[43:54.060 --> 43:56.020]  that's been kind of fucked for the past 10 years,
[43:56.020 --> 43:57.620]  they finally got something to do.
[43:57.620 --> 43:59.220]  The people that got out of college and realized
[43:59.220 --> 44:01.300]  that there's nothing to fucking do with that college degree,
[44:01.300 --> 44:03.180]  sorry to look you straight in the face when I say that.
[44:03.940 --> 44:06.700]  My sociology degree makes shit less confusing
[44:06.700 --> 44:09.420]  to me personally, but it doesn't do fuck all for my bills.
[44:09.420 --> 44:12.060]  Yeah, yeah, and you're gonna work in a dispensary now.
[44:12.060 --> 44:13.620]  It's finally got something for you to do
[44:13.620 --> 44:15.580]  because of this industry and it's helping out.
[44:15.580 --> 44:18.900]  So I do support a dispensary in the city of Pueblo.
[44:18.900 --> 44:21.700]  If my opinion matters to you at all, vote yes,
[44:21.700 --> 44:24.100]  when it comes time to ask about opening dispensaries
[44:24.100 --> 44:26.540]  in the middle of town, because we need that.
[44:26.540 --> 44:27.980]  Make sure you're registered to vote.
[44:27.980 --> 44:29.820]  Make sure your friends are registered to vote.
[44:29.820 --> 44:33.140]  Make sure your lady or your man are registered to vote.
[44:33.140 --> 44:34.740]  If you're out here and you've got a crew
[44:34.740 --> 44:37.860]  and all of you are in those nice ass hats with those pins,
[44:37.860 --> 44:39.100]  make sure you're registered to vote.
[44:39.100 --> 44:40.740]  Cannabis is a gateway drug.
[44:40.740 --> 44:42.260]  It's a gateway to politics.
[44:42.260 --> 44:43.100]  I wouldn't have cared about politics at all.
[44:43.100 --> 44:44.780]  That's been one of my talking points for a while.
[44:44.780 --> 44:46.500]  I would not have cared about politics and voting
[44:46.500 --> 44:48.340]  and gone to city council and shit at all
[44:48.340 --> 44:50.220]  had I not gotten involved in cannabis.
[44:50.220 --> 44:53.820]  The cannabis is the gateway drug, man, to politics.
[44:53.820 --> 44:56.780]  We've survived for so long by being invisible.
[44:56.780 --> 44:57.620]  We had to.
[44:57.620 --> 44:58.460]  We had to.
[44:58.580 --> 45:00.620]  That was how we thrived and survived.
[45:00.620 --> 45:01.580]  We were invisible.
[45:01.580 --> 45:02.700]  No one noticed us.
[45:02.700 --> 45:04.940]  And we stayed out of everybody's line of sight.
[45:04.940 --> 45:08.380]  And now, if we don't all stand up real soon,
[45:09.660 --> 45:12.700]  we're not gonna have legal marijuana in any state anymore.
[45:12.700 --> 45:15.620]  You guys that have cannabis legalized in your states,
[45:15.620 --> 45:16.460]  be careful.
[45:16.460 --> 45:17.500]  Pay attention to what they're doing.
[45:17.500 --> 45:19.260]  Did Washington just fucked up Royal?
[45:19.260 --> 45:20.860]  Did you read about that today?
[45:20.860 --> 45:22.100]  I've seen so much news
[45:22.100 --> 45:23.780]  that I don't know what happened in Washington.
[45:23.780 --> 45:24.700]  My brain is overwhelmed.
[45:24.700 --> 45:25.860]  I was focused on this show.
[45:25.900 --> 45:29.260]  So back maybe six, eight months ago,
[45:29.260 --> 45:32.540]  Colorado's, they did the first underage buy sting
[45:32.540 --> 45:34.860]  and they hit 20 dispensaries in Colorado
[45:34.860 --> 45:37.780]  and up and tall and proud.
[45:37.780 --> 45:39.620]  Not one of them failed.
[45:39.620 --> 45:40.460]  Way to go boys.
[45:40.460 --> 45:41.300]  Yeah, I congratulated them on the show.
[45:41.300 --> 45:43.340]  They just stung Washington.
[45:43.340 --> 45:45.260]  Four of 22 failed.
[45:45.260 --> 45:46.100]  Oh.
[45:46.100 --> 45:46.940]  Fuck you fuckers.
[45:46.940 --> 45:49.500]  I hope somebody fire bombs your fucking store.
[45:49.500 --> 45:52.500]  I hope they take your license and shit in your weed.
[45:52.500 --> 45:54.540]  Yeah, that's Mike's opinion.
[45:54.540 --> 45:56.900]  I kind of agree, but not as fiercely.
[45:56.900 --> 45:57.740]  That does suck, dude.
[45:57.740 --> 46:00.180]  We give you the opportunity to make a lot of money.
[46:00.180 --> 46:02.620]  They sent them a letter a week in advance
[46:02.620 --> 46:04.660]  saying we're gonna sting you.
[46:04.660 --> 46:05.860]  Don't fuck up.
[46:05.860 --> 46:07.540]  And four of them did.
[46:08.620 --> 46:10.900]  You know, part of where I'm gonna give one of those credit
[46:10.900 --> 46:12.500]  to a stupid ass employee.
[46:12.500 --> 46:15.300]  These people should be crucified at HempFest next year.
[46:15.300 --> 46:16.580]  Yeah, let's get it right you guys.
[46:16.580 --> 46:18.540]  We're gonna fucking have this business
[46:18.540 --> 46:20.220]  that you're allowed to make a billion dollars with
[46:20.220 --> 46:22.300]  and sell cannabis and they're letting us play.
[46:22.300 --> 46:25.180]  It's like mom's away and your dad's like,
[46:25.180 --> 46:27.180]  sure you could watch Playboy while she's gone.
[46:27.180 --> 46:28.740]  And fucking now you're fucking it up.
[46:28.740 --> 46:30.740]  Now you're jerking off in front of the kids.
[46:30.740 --> 46:33.260]  Let's zip it up and do this right.
[46:33.260 --> 46:34.100]  You're right, dude.
[46:34.100 --> 46:34.940]  Fire bomb them.
[46:34.940 --> 46:35.780]  I'm sorry.
[46:35.780 --> 46:36.620]  I'm sorry I defended that.
[46:36.620 --> 46:37.460]  It's just so ridiculous.
[46:37.460 --> 46:39.260]  I mean, don't really fire bomb them,
[46:39.260 --> 46:41.500]  but if you shot, pull them up.
[46:41.500 --> 46:43.180]  The store names are in the news.
[46:43.180 --> 46:46.500]  If you live in Seattle and you used to shop there,
[46:46.500 --> 46:47.580]  don't anymore.
[46:47.580 --> 46:49.460]  If you have to pee when you're walking past,
[46:49.460 --> 46:50.740]  hit up their window.
[46:50.740 --> 46:51.940]  Fuck them.
[46:52.580 --> 46:54.260]  I can support that statement on the show
[46:54.260 --> 46:55.500]  because when their window gets pissed on.
[46:55.500 --> 46:57.180]  This statement is brought to you by white Mike,
[46:57.180 --> 46:58.460]  not the podcast.
[46:58.460 --> 46:59.300]  Yeah.
[46:59.300 --> 47:00.140]  Yeah.
[47:00.140 --> 47:00.980]  All right.
[47:00.980 --> 47:01.820]  So now that Mike's got us pissing on windows,
[47:01.820 --> 47:03.780]  I think it's almost time to wrap up the damn show.
[47:05.140 --> 47:05.980]  Hey wife.
[47:05.980 --> 47:06.900]  Yeah.
[47:06.900 --> 47:07.740]  I did not.
[47:07.740 --> 47:08.580]  Shout out to the wife.
[47:08.580 --> 47:09.420]  I did not prompt him for that.
[47:09.420 --> 47:10.260]  She don't listen.
[47:10.260 --> 47:11.900]  I try to remind all my friends to say hi to their wives
[47:11.900 --> 47:12.740]  when they're on the show.
[47:12.740 --> 47:13.580]  Just gets you.
[47:13.580 --> 47:15.060]  Hey baby.
[47:15.060 --> 47:15.900]  Thanks for dinner, sweetie.
[47:15.900 --> 47:16.740]  I don't have one of those.
[47:16.740 --> 47:18.660]  So, hey girl.
[47:18.660 --> 47:19.500]  My wife.
[47:19.500 --> 47:20.340]  My wife.
[47:20.340 --> 47:21.580]  I didn't my wife this show.
[47:22.740 --> 47:23.740]  I made it the whole show.
[47:23.740 --> 47:25.860]  I saw Doug Benson and I was in the front row
[47:25.860 --> 47:27.540]  and he said my wife on stage
[47:27.540 --> 47:29.500]  or somebody else said my wife and he went my wife
[47:29.500 --> 47:30.340]  and I did it too.
[47:30.340 --> 47:31.700]  I went my wife after him.
[47:31.700 --> 47:33.220]  And I think the people on stage heard me.
[47:33.220 --> 47:34.460]  It was kind of awkward for me.
[47:34.460 --> 47:35.300]  It was funny.
[47:35.300 --> 47:36.140]  Nice.
[47:36.140 --> 47:37.340]  All right.
[47:37.340 --> 47:38.180]  Yeah.
[47:38.180 --> 47:39.020]  Follow Mike on Twitter.
[47:39.020 --> 47:39.860]  Yeah.
[47:39.860 --> 47:40.700]  Hit me up.
[47:40.700 --> 47:41.540]  It's Nemopunk15.
[47:41.540 --> 47:43.700]  N-E-M-O-P-U-N-K-1-5.
[47:43.700 --> 47:44.540]  Yeah.
[47:44.540 --> 47:45.380]  Follow him.
[47:45.380 --> 47:46.700]  He posts a lot of cool cannabis related shit.
[47:46.700 --> 47:47.540]  Lots of links.
[47:47.540 --> 47:48.660]  Lots of news.
[47:48.660 --> 47:49.500]  Yep.
[47:49.500 --> 47:50.380]  I appreciate the follows guys.
[47:50.380 --> 47:51.620]  Guys, we're going to wrap this up.
[47:52.140 --> 47:53.060]  This will probably,
[47:53.060 --> 47:54.420]  I'm not even sure when I'm going to put this out.
[47:54.420 --> 47:55.260]  It might be Monday.
[47:55.260 --> 47:56.100]  It might be Wednesday.
[47:56.100 --> 47:57.460]  Either way, I'll be back in a couple of days
[47:57.460 --> 47:58.620]  with another episode.
[47:58.620 --> 48:01.820]  I did not forget about that perpetual grow episode
[48:01.820 --> 48:02.660]  I told you about.
[48:02.660 --> 48:03.940]  Like I said, I've been writing that
[48:03.940 --> 48:06.220]  and more shit keeps popping up to do shows about.
[48:06.220 --> 48:07.860]  It was a big news week guys.
[48:07.860 --> 48:08.700]  Sorry.
[48:08.700 --> 48:10.300]  And Mike was around and I was like, let's do this.
[48:10.300 --> 48:11.140]  Yeah.
[48:11.140 --> 48:12.860]  It was looking for something to do.

[49:29.900 --> 49:32.340]  We did do a few adjustments to the website.
[49:32.340 --> 49:34.340]  It'll be working more quickly for you.
[49:34.340 --> 49:35.900]  The downloads will be smoother.
[49:35.900 --> 49:37.620]  I've actually been compressing the files
[49:37.620 --> 49:39.300]  that I send to Stitcher and iTunes
[49:39.300 --> 49:41.980]  so that they'll download on your mobile device more quickly.

[50:15.100 --> 50:17.260]  Like I said, I'm getting a new transmission in the car.
[50:17.260 --> 50:19.060]  It's about 2,500 bucks.
[50:19.060 --> 50:20.820]  Every dollar you throw down is one less
[50:20.820 --> 50:23.140]  that I have to dig out of a hole somewhere.
[50:23.140 --> 50:23.980]  Right.
[50:23.980 --> 50:26.460]  Yeah, I talked about all the social media stuff.
[50:26.460 --> 50:28.300]  I think that's all we gotta do.
[50:28.300 --> 50:30.740]  Hit us up on Twitter and Facebook and whatnot, folks.
[50:30.740 --> 50:32.180]  Ask questions, send emails.
[50:32.180 --> 50:33.840]  I love interactions, I really do.
[50:33.840 --> 50:35.740]  Questions build good shows, guys.
[50:35.740 --> 50:36.580]  That's the truth.
[50:36.580 --> 50:38.940]  A lot of the episodes come out of people's questions.
[50:38.940 --> 50:41.280]  So until next time, you guys, shout out to my ninja Spence.
[50:41.280 --> 50:42.280]  Thanks again for listening.
[50:42.280 --> 50:44.780]  Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.

[51:10.010 --> 51:11.490]  Crush it, give me hand, get me.
[51:11.490 --> 51:31.680]  But we run.
[51:31.680 --> 51:33.160]  Them say it's not normal.
[51:33.160 --> 51:34.920]  No leftover sniff tail.
[51:34.920 --> 51:36.000]  Like busy signal.
[51:36.000 --> 51:37.240]  We stop the whole town.
[51:37.240 --> 51:38.360]  It's a big spliff.
[51:38.360 --> 51:40.160]  Only one like one.
