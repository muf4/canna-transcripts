[00:00.000 --> 00:06.240]  Welcome back, Podcast World! It is time for Episode 434 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:06.240 --> 00:10.160]  This episode of the show is brought to you by my friends at Seeds Here Now. If you need
[00:10.160 --> 00:20.320]  new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Seeds Here Now, and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:20.320 --> 00:24.920]  It has become a tradition that we start this podcast off by talking about what I'm dabbing.
[00:25.160 --> 00:31.240]  I've been taking dabs of Mochi Gelato Ambrosia from Apothecary Farms. The label says this product
[00:31.240 --> 00:41.080]  contains 68.7% THC and 81.7% total cannabinoids. I really like the Mochi Gelato. The flavor is
[00:41.080 --> 00:47.480]  perfect, the buzz is just right, and the amount of gigantic diamonds to terp sauce in this 4g jar
[00:47.480 --> 00:53.240]  was perfect. I really approve of this product. So big shout out to our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[00:53.240 --> 00:58.920]  Apothecary Farms and many of my other favorite concentrate companies will be at the Dude Grows
[00:58.920 --> 01:05.880]  Concentration Celebration on 7-13 at Cultivated Synergy. The Dude Grows crew, myself, Apothecary
[01:05.880 --> 01:11.640]  Farms, and many other popular concentrate companies from Colorado will be at the 7-10
[01:11.640 --> 01:16.760]  Concentration Celebration. Scotty and the crew have planned a great educational experience.
[01:16.760 --> 01:21.240]  Also, there will be a little concentration competition going on. I would love to see
[01:21.240 --> 01:25.240]  a bunch of the Irie Army there. If you're interested in the Dude Grows Concentration
[01:25.240 --> 01:30.680]  Celebration, please check out dudegrows.com. For full details on how to get tickets, how to enter,

[02:44.120 --> 02:48.360]  campaign. All right, ladies and gentlemen, I said that I was going to read some iTunes customer
[02:48.360 --> 02:53.320]  reviews. Let's pull up iTunes and jump right into that part. If you would like to leave an iTunes
[02:53.320 --> 02:57.880]  customer rating and review, it is really easy. Most of you are listening on an Apple device.
[02:57.880 --> 03:02.120]  You've got an iPhone or an iPad or possibly an Apple computer. It is really easy to leave a
[03:02.120 --> 03:07.800]  review. If you are using an iPhone or an iPad, all you have to do is open the podcast application in
[03:07.800 --> 03:12.120]  that device, then find the podcast you want to leave a review for. In this case, we want to leave
[03:12.120 --> 03:17.000]  a review for the Grow From Your Heart podcast. So simply click on the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[03:17.000 --> 03:21.320]  Then it will show you the episodes that are saved in your phone. Then it will show available
[03:21.320 --> 03:26.120]  episodes, then previously played. Then you will see ratings and reviews. It will give you the
[03:26.120 --> 03:31.080]  option to tap and rate. You can give me as many stars as you feel I deserve. Then right below that,
[03:31.080 --> 03:36.120]  it will show write a review. Tap on that and it will give you the option to write a review.
[03:36.760 --> 03:40.200]  I would appreciate it if you leave a review of the podcast on iTunes.
[03:40.200 --> 03:47.000]  The most current podcast reviews go a lot like this. Our first review was left on May 8th. It
[03:47.000 --> 03:53.400]  was left by a person who calls themselves Blackbird76. They gave us a five-star rating.
[03:53.400 --> 03:58.360]  They said, best educational podcast out there. Then the review goes like this.
[03:58.360 --> 04:04.600]  If you're at all interested in growing, this is the go-to podcast. Rasta Jeff drops a ton of great
[04:04.600 --> 04:10.280]  knowledge while keeping it fun and easy to understand. If I start to feel lost or a little
[04:10.280 --> 04:15.720]  overwhelmed, I smoke a bowl, check the catalog, and Rasta Jeff will help with my question or push
[04:15.720 --> 04:21.400]  my brain in the right direction. Thanks, Jeff. Hey, Blackbird, thank you for the great review.
[04:21.400 --> 04:26.280]  I love hearing that my show is your go-to when you need grow information. I also like that you
[04:26.280 --> 04:30.440]  say if you're at all interested in growing to check out the podcast. I do try to keep it,
[04:30.440 --> 04:35.080]  like I've said plenty of times, I like to keep the podcast listenable for brand new growers,
[04:35.080 --> 04:39.400]  and I like to go in-depth for people who are really experienced. I try to make it for everybody.
[04:39.400 --> 04:43.560]  I'm glad you see that. I'm glad you see the knowledge, and I'm glad you think it's easy
[04:43.560 --> 04:48.440]  to understand. I really try to break it down. I did not like school, but I really like learning.
[04:48.440 --> 04:53.000]  Making things easy to understand, teaching things in several different creative ways,
[04:53.000 --> 04:56.440]  I'm glad that you see me trying to do that, and I'm glad the show is working for you.
[04:56.440 --> 05:00.040]  I'm glad that sometimes when you do feel lost or overwhelmed, which is a good thing,
[05:00.040 --> 05:03.240]  that means you're learning. That means you're thinking beyond your bubble and you need to
[05:03.240 --> 05:07.560]  expand a little. If you ever do feel lost and overwhelmed, I'm glad that you smoke a bowl and
[05:07.560 --> 05:12.360]  check the catalog of podcasts, and then I am able to help you get your brain in the right direction.
[05:12.360 --> 05:15.880]  You ended the review by saying thank you. Hey, Blackbird, thank you for listening,
[05:15.880 --> 05:21.640]  and thanks for the great review. Let's move on to the next iTunes customer review.
[05:21.640 --> 05:25.960]  This one was left on May 11th. It was left by a person who calls themselves
[05:25.960 --> 05:29.480]  Kush Is My Cologne. The headline of their review says,
[05:29.480 --> 05:34.360]  Love the show. Keep up the good work. They gave us another five-star review.
[05:34.360 --> 05:41.160]  The iTunes customer review goes a lot like this. One of the best educational and entertaining
[05:41.160 --> 05:47.240]  cannabis podcast shows to date. Also, thanks for not becoming just another expensive genetics
[05:47.240 --> 05:52.520]  company. One love. Then they sign it with a bunch of, looks like smoke or cloud blowing,
[05:52.680 --> 05:57.480]  they're puffing smoke emojis, and then a peace sign. Big old puffs of clouds right back at you,
[05:57.480 --> 06:00.840]  bro. A bunch of smoke blowing right in your direction, and then another peace sign right
[06:00.840 --> 06:05.960]  back at you. He says, one of the best educational and entertaining. That is my goal. Those are great
[06:05.960 --> 06:10.920]  words to see in a review. I'm glad I'm hitting my goal, entertaining and educational. That's
[06:10.920 --> 06:14.760]  what I'm trying to do, keep you listening and teach you some stuff at the same time.
[06:14.760 --> 06:20.200]  Then he says, thanks for not becoming just another expensive genetics company. You are very welcome.
[06:20.200 --> 06:25.080]  I've got a lot of passion for cannabis. Many people know, many people do not know that I am the
[06:25.080 --> 06:30.440]  sole breeder, the founder, the sole proprietor of iRegenetics Colorado. I do produce high-quality
[06:30.440 --> 06:35.640]  premium seeds. My seeds are available in several locations. I started the show by saying they're
[06:35.640 --> 06:40.600]  available at seedsherenow.com. They're also available at dankseed.store. You can get the
[06:40.600 --> 06:45.640]  seeds at OregonEliteSeeds.com. They're available in many places. When you go to look for the seeds,
[06:45.640 --> 06:50.840]  you will see that they are very modestly priced. I want everybody to have access to high-quality
[06:50.840 --> 06:55.800]  seeds. I make sure that my seeds are affordable. I work with my distributors and my vendors to make
[06:55.800 --> 07:00.760]  sure that those seeds stay at an affordable price point so that everybody has access to quality
[07:00.760 --> 07:05.640]  seeds. I think it's unfair that some people can't get quality medicine because they don't have a
[07:05.640 --> 07:10.200]  bunch of money to get some hyped up seeds that they've seen in a magazine that have been hyped
[07:10.200 --> 07:15.160]  up for way too long and now they're way overpriced. Some people just need good medicine. They don't
[07:15.160 --> 07:19.640]  need all that advertising. They don't need all the hype. I make sure that that is available to
[07:19.640 --> 07:24.440]  everybody. Thanks for noticing that I'm not just another expensive seed company. That is a great
[07:24.440 --> 07:30.280]  compliment. Once again, thank you for the great review and for the five-star rating. I do have a
[07:30.280 --> 07:37.000]  couple of more reviews on the screen. Let's keep moving. This one was left on May 14th. This one
[07:37.000 --> 07:42.680]  was left by somebody who calls themselves DaddyO45. The headline says, Rasta Jeff kicks butt.
[07:42.680 --> 07:48.760]  Thank you, bro. You kick butt too for leaving a great review. The review goes a lot like this.
[07:48.760 --> 07:53.640]  It's so cool that General Rasta Jeff, leader of the Irie Army, is a returning host on the panel
[07:53.640 --> 07:59.400]  of the Embracing Organics show. Yes, that is right. Quite often, I do go on the Embracing
[07:59.400 --> 08:05.000]  Organics live show. Embracing Organics is another cannabis-based podcast. The show is live on
[08:05.000 --> 08:10.040]  YouTube. It is hosted by my friend Dirtman Dan. We've got guys like Tenaci Gardens on there.
[08:10.040 --> 08:15.640]  Stabby McStabberson is on there. Medfit is on there quite frequently. Zen Gardens is there.
[08:15.640 --> 08:20.600]  Barragrone comes and enjoys us. Sometimes Canuck Grower is on there, maybe 710 Canuck.
[08:20.600 --> 08:25.400]  Anyway, my Canadian friend comes and jumps in. It is a great podcast about growing. I like to
[08:25.400 --> 08:31.800]  join them when I can on Thursdays. We get into deep growing conversations, and we also go into
[08:31.800 --> 08:37.320]  some really silly conversation. If you're into cannabis podcasts, I think you would enjoy the
[08:37.320 --> 08:42.280]  Embracing Organics show live on YouTube on Thursdays. They also do leave it up, so you can
[08:42.280 --> 08:47.720]  catch that at any time. Catch the live show. Join us. It is Thursdays at 7 o'clock Mountain Time.
[08:47.720 --> 08:51.960]  I don't know what time that is where you are. I've got to be there about 7. Join us for that one.
[08:51.960 --> 08:56.440]  The review does go on. I got rambly. It says, I think it would be hella cool if you, General
[08:56.440 --> 09:03.160]  Rasta Jeff, would start a 100% organic no-till home grow, but with your style of growing.
[09:03.640 --> 09:10.680]  Well, I'm not really a no-till grower, and I'm not into the organic idea. I do bottles and salts
[09:10.680 --> 09:16.600]  and powder nutrients and things like that. It's not really my style to go no-till or 100% organic,
[09:16.600 --> 09:21.640]  but let's keep going just to see where this review goes. It says, hell, make a video podcast
[09:21.640 --> 09:27.400]  grow lessons. That way we could all grow and learn along with you, Rasta Jeff. That's a really good
[09:27.400 --> 09:33.080]  idea. I do like that. Like I said a second ago, I don't really do the 100% organic no-till type
[09:33.080 --> 09:38.040]  stuff. I would have to change everything. I would have to start some no-till soil. I would have to
[09:38.040 --> 09:44.520]  rethink my whole process. I have my grow spaces dedicated to breeding projects for at least the
[09:44.520 --> 09:50.600]  next six months. As a breeder, I do make a schedule. As a Colorado grower, I am very limited
[09:50.600 --> 09:55.320]  to space on my personal grows. Those are mostly dedicated to breeding and testing the breeding
[09:55.320 --> 10:00.680]  projects. If I do come across more commercial space and we do do some sort of a no-till thing,
[10:00.680 --> 10:03.880]  I will think about making some lessons and videos to go with that.
[10:03.880 --> 10:07.880]  But right now I can't do a no-till thing because that is not even my style. We would have to get
[10:07.880 --> 10:11.960]  Sean to come in and help us out with that. I'd have to call in somebody that is more experienced
[10:11.960 --> 10:16.600]  in that, maybe get Frosty to come help out, but that is not my area of expertise. Maybe Jesse
[10:16.600 --> 10:20.760]  could guide us. Maybe we can get somebody to help us with some more no-till stuff in the future.
[10:20.760 --> 10:25.560]  I do appreciate the enthusiasm, but I don't want to steer you wrong. That is not my wheelhouse.
[10:25.560 --> 10:30.440]  I am not the no-till guy, and I'm not afraid to admit that that is not my area of expertise.
[10:30.440 --> 10:34.440]  If you want to set up a commercial facility, if you want to set up drip lines and run stuff like
[10:34.440 --> 10:38.040]  Veg Bloom or New Millennium or something like that, I can really steer you the right way.
[10:38.040 --> 10:43.080]  But this no-till stuff, that is not my area of expertise. So I couldn't even do the episodes
[10:43.080 --> 10:48.280]  that you're asking for. Let's keep going because there is more of this review. It continues. It
[10:48.280 --> 10:53.880]  says, where am I? I lost my place. It says, thank you for all that you have and will do for the
[10:53.880 --> 11:01.240]  whole 420 community. And then he signs the message with, your iry army grunt, Richard 420 Gramps
[11:01.240 --> 11:06.600]  Memel Juan. Hey, I know who you are, my friend. Thank you for all of the support and thank you
[11:06.600 --> 11:11.720]  for the great review. I do appreciate all of the kind input, and I do appreciate you finishing that
[11:11.720 --> 11:16.280]  up with saying thanks for what I do for the whole 420 community. That does mean a lot to me. So
[11:16.280 --> 11:21.160]  thanks for the great review and thanks for the kind words. I do have more reviews on the screen.
[11:21.160 --> 11:28.520]  The next one goes like this. It was left on May 18th by a person who calls themselves PJam7913.
[11:29.080 --> 11:32.680]  The headline says, I love this Rasta man. Big up. I love you too, brother.
[11:32.680 --> 11:39.320]  They left a five-star rating. The review says, very amazing podcast. Rasta Jeff has some of the
[11:39.320 --> 11:43.640]  best info out there. Hey, I'm glad my info is helping you out. I hope you are applying it to
[11:43.640 --> 11:49.480]  your garden. Then it says, I love this show and everything about it from PJam. It doesn't get
[11:49.480 --> 11:54.280]  much better than that. That is a great review. We've got a great headline. We've got five stars.
[11:54.280 --> 11:58.040]  We've got a stellar review, and you've got a name that I can pronounce. That was perfect.
[11:58.040 --> 12:03.000]  Thank you for the great review. I do appreciate that. This is the last review for this episode.
[12:03.000 --> 12:07.880]  Let's jump right into this one. This one was left on May 18th by a person who calls themselves
[12:07.880 --> 12:14.440]  IttyBitty16. The headline says, this is the podcast you have been looking for. Then it is
[12:14.440 --> 12:19.720]  followed by two thumbs up emojis, a bunch of flames, and a bunch of stars. It looks like they
[12:19.720 --> 12:27.160]  gave us five stars. I always like a nice five-star review. The review goes like this. This podcast has
[12:27.160 --> 12:31.720]  more knowledge than public school has to offer. That is pretty cool. I'm glad you feel that way.
[12:31.720 --> 12:37.320]  Jeff himself, just to hear him ramble, you should listen. That is a weird sentence, but I like it.
[12:37.320 --> 12:42.280]  Jeff himself, just to hear him ramble, you should listen. That sounds like some sort of programming.
[12:42.280 --> 12:47.960]  I hope it worked. Then he has White Mike to come in and give you a real look at the judicial side
[12:47.960 --> 12:53.560]  of things. Yes, I do like to bring White Mike in to talk about the legal side, the political side,
[12:53.560 --> 12:57.960]  the activism side of things. I focus on the grow and that sort of stuff. I bring Mike in for a
[12:57.960 --> 13:02.120]  different view. Then I like to bring, like I mentioned earlier, Jesse comes in and talks about
[13:02.120 --> 13:06.760]  outdoor and no-till growing. Sean comes and talks about organic growing. I bring in a lot of friends
[13:06.760 --> 13:11.080]  to talk about a lot of great stuff. I'm glad you noticed that. Then the review goes on. It says,
[13:11.080 --> 13:17.080]  if you have a question, Jeff will take his time and help you. Yes, I do my best to answer every
[13:17.080 --> 13:22.920]  question. I have a giant stack of emails filled with questions. I've got an email inbox that I
[13:22.920 --> 13:27.160]  have not even been able to print all of those questions, but I do my best to get to every
[13:27.160 --> 13:31.960]  single one. It does take some time, but I do my best to answer all of the questions that come
[13:31.960 --> 13:37.160]  through the email. I do my best to answer all of the social media questions. Then I go on Instagram
[13:37.160 --> 13:43.320]  live every Monday at 710 Mountain Time. We talk about growing there. I answer questions from the
[13:43.320 --> 13:48.680]  people who are watching. I answer random on-the-fly grow questions. I talk about cannabis culture. I
[13:48.680 --> 13:54.280]  talk about cannabis news. Sometimes I take a few dabs and just ramble. I do try to answer as many
[13:54.280 --> 13:58.520]  questions as possible. The review goes on. It says, most people won't even help their families.
[13:58.520 --> 14:03.800]  Unfortunately, that is true today. Then it says, if you are looking for anything cannabis-related
[14:03.800 --> 14:08.680]  industry, you have found it. Oh, I love that. That is a great review. I want to give a big
[14:08.680 --> 14:14.760]  thanks to my new friend, IttyBitty16. Thank you for the five-star rating. Once again, thank you
[14:14.760 --> 14:19.160]  for the great review. Ladies and gentlemen, that wraps up the rating and review portion of this
[14:19.160 --> 14:23.800]  podcast. I want to give a big thanks and a big shout out to everybody who left us a review on
