[00:02.430 --> 00:04.430]  Hey, what up, Podcast World?
[00:04.430 --> 00:05.430]  It's Rasta Jeff.
[00:05.430 --> 00:08.990]  A lot of people have been asking for old episodes of the podcast that are no longer available
[00:08.990 --> 00:10.790]  in the iTunes and Stitcher feed.
[00:10.790 --> 00:14.430]  I decided to put old episodes together in large chunks and throw them back into the
[00:14.430 --> 00:19.710]  feed so that you can enjoy them without interrupting the current podcast schedule.
[00:19.710 --> 00:22.750]  Before we get into the old episodes, there are a couple of things I should tell you.
[00:22.750 --> 00:26.430]  Up until episode 50, the show was called the iGrow Culture Podcast.
[00:26.430 --> 00:29.430]  I changed the name to Grow From Your Heart at episode 50.
[00:29.430 --> 00:34.670]  Also, I should make a disclaimer that I have learned a lot in 180 episodes of podcasting,
[00:34.670 --> 00:39.070]  so some of my ideas and opinions at the start of the show may be strongly different from
[00:39.070 --> 00:40.990]  my opinions now and in the future.
[00:40.990 --> 00:42.990]  So don't hold anything against me.
[00:42.990 --> 00:43.990]  All right.
[00:43.990 --> 00:46.350]  You guys, episode one is probably quite embarrassing.
[00:46.350 --> 00:47.750]  I can't even listen to it.
[00:47.750 --> 00:48.830]  So I hope you do listen to it.
[00:48.830 --> 00:49.830]  I hope you enjoy it.
[00:49.830 --> 00:53.710]  I cannot wait to hear your comments on iTunes, and I cannot wait to hear your tweets.
[00:53.710 --> 00:54.710]  Make sure you tweet me.
[00:54.710 --> 00:55.710]  It's at GFYH podcast.
[00:56.710 --> 01:02.710]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's episodes one, two, and three of the Grow From Your Heart
[01:02.710 --> 01:03.710]  podcast.
[01:38.230 --> 01:39.230]  What's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:39.230 --> 01:40.230]  My name's Ross DeGeoff.
[01:40.230 --> 01:43.230]  Welcome to the very first episode of the iGrow Culture Podcast.
[01:43.230 --> 01:46.230]  For some reason, my mic is blowing out real bad, but we'll fix that later.
[01:46.230 --> 01:49.230]  I'd like to thank you guys for tuning in to the very first episode.
[01:49.230 --> 01:50.230]  We got the chuckles over here.
[01:50.230 --> 01:52.230]  We've had a couple few dabs.
[01:52.230 --> 01:53.230]  Dabs will do that.
[01:53.230 --> 01:54.230]  Dabs will do that, bro.
[01:54.230 --> 01:55.230]  This is already fun.
[01:55.230 --> 01:56.230]  It's so much fun today.
[01:56.230 --> 01:59.230]  We're dabbing out on some, what do we got?
[01:59.230 --> 02:00.230]  Jack the Ripper.
[02:00.230 --> 02:04.230]  I grew it, and my buddy over here, my buddy Kevin from Elevated Concentrations, blasted
[02:04.230 --> 02:05.230]  it for me.
[02:05.230 --> 02:06.230]  I'm waving even though you can't see me.
[02:06.230 --> 02:07.230]  Hi, bro.
[02:07.230 --> 02:08.230]  He's waving and I'm chuckling at him.
[02:08.230 --> 02:09.230]  I'm waving back, people.
[02:09.230 --> 02:13.230]  The guy over here to my left, we call him Milky Tricombs.
[02:13.230 --> 02:14.230]  It's my buddy White Mike.
[02:14.230 --> 02:15.230]  What's up, bro?
[02:15.230 --> 02:16.230]  What's up, people?
[02:16.230 --> 02:18.230]  My name is Ross DeGeoff.
[02:18.230 --> 02:19.230]  I'm a grower.
[02:19.230 --> 02:20.230]  I'm a breeder.
[02:20.230 --> 02:21.230]  I got to fix my mic.
[02:21.230 --> 02:22.230]  It's blowing up.
[02:22.230 --> 02:23.230]  Hold on.
[02:23.230 --> 02:24.230]  Boom.
[02:24.230 --> 02:25.230]  Should be fixed.
[02:25.230 --> 02:26.230]  Hold on.
[02:26.230 --> 02:27.230]  There we go.
[02:27.230 --> 02:28.230]  I'm back.
[02:28.230 --> 02:29.230]  All right.
[02:29.230 --> 02:30.230]  They call me Ross DeGeoff.
[02:30.230 --> 02:31.230]  I'm a medical marijuana patient.
[02:31.230 --> 02:32.230]  I've been smoking for over 20 years.
[02:32.230 --> 02:33.230]  I'm a grower.
[02:33.230 --> 02:34.230]  I'm also a caregiver.
[02:34.230 --> 02:37.230]  I like to teach people how to grow clean, safe, and effective medicine.
[02:37.230 --> 02:40.230]  After being involved with the plant for so long, I thought I should become a breeder.
[02:40.230 --> 02:42.230]  I started doing some pollen chucking.
[02:42.230 --> 02:45.230]  Eventually, I put together my own little seed company.
[02:45.230 --> 02:47.230]  Now, I've got Iry Genetics Colorado.
[02:47.230 --> 02:49.230]  Check out IryGeneticsColorado.com.
[02:49.230 --> 02:50.230]  All right?
[02:50.230 --> 02:51.230]  Thanks a lot.
[02:51.230 --> 02:53.230]  How about you, Kev?
[02:53.230 --> 02:54.230]  What are you?
[02:54.230 --> 02:55.230]  You're sneezing.
[02:55.230 --> 02:56.230]  Hold on.
[02:56.230 --> 02:57.230]  I'll give you a second.
[02:57.230 --> 02:58.230]  We'll go to Mike.
[02:58.230 --> 02:59.230]  No, I'm just rubbing the nose.
[02:59.230 --> 03:00.230]  You're just rubbing the nose, man.
[03:00.230 --> 03:01.230]  All right.
[03:01.230 --> 03:02.230]  What do you call yourself, bro?
[03:02.230 --> 03:03.230]  What do you call yourself?
[03:03.230 --> 03:06.230]  I call myself Kevin or Kevbro or KJ.
[03:06.230 --> 03:07.230]  I have very many names.
[03:07.230 --> 03:08.230]  All right.
[03:08.230 --> 03:09.230]  What I want to know, motherfucker.
[03:09.230 --> 03:12.230]  I make concentrates for fun.
[03:12.230 --> 03:15.230]  It's awesome to me, hopefully for a job pretty soon.
[03:15.230 --> 03:18.230]  I founded Elevated Concentrations, which—
[03:18.230 --> 03:20.230]  Stay in your microphone so we can hear you.
[03:20.230 --> 03:23.230]  —which will be returning very soon.
[03:23.230 --> 03:27.230]  I had some issues and had to remove the marketing, so to speak.
[03:27.230 --> 03:28.230]  But other than that, we're all golden.
[03:28.230 --> 03:30.230]  We're still doing what we do.
[03:30.230 --> 03:32.230]  So, helping out bros like Iry Jeff.
[03:32.230 --> 03:33.230]  Nice.
[03:33.230 --> 03:35.230]  Have some good supplies of concentrates.
[03:35.230 --> 03:36.230]  Some good hash.
[03:36.230 --> 03:38.230]  He keeps me supplied with my head stash.
[03:38.230 --> 03:40.230]  It's pretty epic.
[03:40.230 --> 03:42.230]  So, what do you like to smoke, bro?
[03:42.230 --> 03:44.230]  When you're smoking flowers, do you like to smoke Indicas or Sativas?
[03:44.230 --> 03:46.230]  I like Indicas.
[03:46.230 --> 03:50.230]  I'm a huge fan of blueberry and some Deadhead OG.
[03:50.230 --> 03:53.230]  I know a guy that grows some pretty killer Deadhead OG.
[03:53.230 --> 03:54.230]  I know one myself.
[03:54.230 --> 03:55.230]  All right.
[03:55.230 --> 03:58.230]  I usually ask people—I want to ask people if they're a medical or a rec patient,
[03:58.230 --> 03:59.230]  but I know you.
[03:59.230 --> 04:00.230]  I know you're a medical patient.
[04:00.230 --> 04:01.230]  Yes, sir.
[04:01.230 --> 04:04.230]  Do you find a line between medicating and recreating?
[04:05.230 --> 04:13.230]  Sometimes I do because it doesn't really take very much to medicate and to make myself feel better
[04:13.230 --> 04:15.230]  and to help my ailments.
[04:16.230 --> 04:20.230]  Sometimes I just like to get really stoned and I go beyond that.
[04:20.230 --> 04:26.230]  I smoke more than I actually need, but it helps my head a lot when I do that.
[04:26.230 --> 04:27.230]  Like your vibe, your attitude?
[04:27.230 --> 04:28.230]  Yeah.
[04:28.230 --> 04:29.230]  Really helps my aura.
[04:29.230 --> 04:33.230]  It helps me to sleep a lot if I over-medicate in the evenings.
[04:34.230 --> 04:35.230]  So it's not over-medicating.
[04:35.230 --> 04:36.230]  It's perfectly medicating.
[04:36.230 --> 04:37.230]  Kind of. Yeah.
[04:37.230 --> 04:38.230]  Right.
[04:38.230 --> 04:40.230]  Every other sleep drug isn't light.
[04:40.230 --> 04:42.230]  It's just cannabis works better.
[04:42.230 --> 04:44.230]  That other dude over here to my left, that's my buddy Mike.
[04:44.230 --> 04:46.230]  We're going to ask him, how long have you been smoking weed, bro?
[04:47.230 --> 04:50.230]  Since I was 15, 14.
[04:50.230 --> 04:52.230]  Well, somebody's got to do math for us.
[04:52.230 --> 04:53.230]  How old are you?
[04:53.230 --> 04:54.230]  I'm 30.
[04:54.230 --> 04:56.230]  I'm almost 32.
[04:56.230 --> 04:57.230]  At the end of the month, I'll be 32.
[04:57.230 --> 04:58.230]  All right.
[04:58.230 --> 04:59.230]  So 17 years now.
[05:00.230 --> 05:03.230]  Do you consider yourself a medical or a recreational smoker?
[05:03.230 --> 05:06.230]  For a good chunk of that, it was completely recreational.
[05:06.230 --> 05:08.230]  It was just something fun I did occasionally with friends.
[05:08.230 --> 05:11.230]  And then I got injured a couple of years ago working.
[05:11.230 --> 05:14.230]  I hurt my neck real bad and messed up some of the discs in my neck
[05:14.230 --> 05:19.230]  and had some nerve-generated pain is what the fancy doctor folks would call it.
[05:19.230 --> 05:22.230]  And cannabis works a lot better than the pain pills they had me on.
[05:22.230 --> 05:26.230]  And that was really my personal entry into the medical world.
[05:26.230 --> 05:29.230]  So now it's both, I would say.
[05:29.230 --> 05:33.230]  But the regular use of cannabis is definitely medical rather than recreational.
[05:33.230 --> 05:35.230]  I would agree with that for sure.
[05:35.230 --> 05:39.230]  If it was recreational, I'd probably hit some joints on the weekend or something.
[05:39.230 --> 05:43.230]  But the definite consistent use is medical for sure.
[05:43.230 --> 05:44.230]  Okay.
[05:44.230 --> 05:47.230]  There's definitely a line between when the pain stops
[05:47.230 --> 05:51.230]  and any sort of enjoyment or entertainment begins.
[05:51.230 --> 05:53.230]  Video game time or whatever.
[05:53.230 --> 05:55.230]  Yeah, that line's easy to feel.
[05:55.230 --> 05:59.230]  You can tell when, okay, my pain's gone.
[05:59.230 --> 06:00.230]  I can get up.
[06:00.230 --> 06:02.230]  I can do what I've got to do for the day.
[06:02.230 --> 06:05.230]  And then you can kind of feel the pain slowly coming back
[06:05.230 --> 06:08.230]  and go medicate a little bit more, the pain goes away.
[06:08.230 --> 06:13.230]  And the line before you become intoxicated is really easy to walk for me.
[06:13.230 --> 06:18.230]  But when I get home and want to unwind, definitely recreational.
[06:18.230 --> 06:19.230]  Okay.
[06:19.230 --> 06:20.230]  Dabs for me are recreational.
[06:20.230 --> 06:22.230]  I go right past medicated into happy place.
[06:22.230 --> 06:24.230]  Okay, that's a good line to draw there.
[06:24.230 --> 06:25.230]  I'm the opposite.
[06:25.230 --> 06:28.230]  Dabs for me are very medical because I have a lot of respiratory issues.
[06:28.230 --> 06:31.230]  And smoking, the herb really gets to me.
[06:31.230 --> 06:34.230]  Smoking a lot of weed really gets to me.
[06:34.230 --> 06:37.230]  So doing the dabs and not having to smoke so much,
[06:37.230 --> 06:40.230]  and now that we've learned about de-waxing and all that stuff
[06:40.230 --> 06:42.230]  and getting a lot of that plant matter out of it
[06:42.230 --> 06:46.230]  has really helped me to not be congested or wheeze all the time.
[06:46.230 --> 06:49.230]  And, you know, that's if I'm doing quality dabs.
[06:49.230 --> 06:53.230]  But I notice if you do some dirty stuff, it kind of hinders that a little bit.
[06:54.230 --> 06:56.230]  Dude, Mike and I – sorry to interrupt you.
[06:56.230 --> 06:58.230]  You just made me think of dirty stuff.
[06:58.230 --> 06:59.230]  Oh, that's cool.
[06:59.230 --> 07:01.230]  No, no, no, not that kind of dirty stuff.
[07:01.230 --> 07:03.230]  You should have been here earlier. It was filthy.
[07:03.230 --> 07:05.230]  No, no, it's not that kind of show. Not yet.
[07:05.230 --> 07:06.230]  So I met Mike basically.
[07:06.230 --> 07:09.230]  He started coming to the dispensary I worked at, managed, whatever.
[07:09.230 --> 07:11.230]  I had a lot of roles there.
[07:11.230 --> 07:16.230]  And he got to see the evolution of dirty stuff come to what it is now.
[07:16.230 --> 07:17.230]  Yeah.
[07:17.230 --> 07:20.230]  Remember some of the junk we used to see come to that dispensary?
[07:20.230 --> 07:23.230]  People would try to pass off as earwax or VHO.
[07:23.230 --> 07:26.230]  They were calling it butter because it was goopy and syrupy.
[07:26.230 --> 07:34.230]  The first time I was handed earwax was black tar in a Coke vial.
[07:34.230 --> 07:36.230]  And the guy said, this is earwax hash.
[07:36.230 --> 07:39.230]  He handed it to me, and I looked him in the face.
[07:39.230 --> 07:44.230]  I was new at the shop, so my automatic response to insult the product
[07:44.230 --> 07:48.230]  that I was just handed had to be gut-checked and kind of held in reserve.
[07:48.230 --> 07:52.230]  And I just kind of nodded and put it back on the shelf.
[07:52.230 --> 07:55.230]  I didn't feel like I could say anything there, but good Lord.
[07:55.230 --> 08:01.230]  The quality of hash in the last six years is light years ahead of where it was.
[08:01.230 --> 08:03.230]  Yeah, definitely.
[08:03.230 --> 08:06.230]  The stuff Little Kev brings back for me is freaking impressive.
[08:06.230 --> 08:10.230]  Yeah, that's – well, I mean, you've got to thank a lot of the whole community
[08:10.230 --> 08:12.230]  for doing that for us.
[08:12.230 --> 08:17.230]  Everyone sharing knowledge with each other and being fairly open with each other
[08:17.230 --> 08:23.230]  and people being willing to read and learn and gain that knowledge
[08:23.230 --> 08:26.230]  has really made that happen.
[08:26.230 --> 08:28.230]  I heard you say something interesting the other day,
[08:28.230 --> 08:31.230]  and I want you to get closer to the mic just for this one thing.
[08:31.230 --> 08:35.230]  If I want to get into hash, what's the first step?
[08:35.230 --> 08:37.230]  If I want to make hash. Sorry, not get into it.
[08:37.230 --> 08:39.230]  If I want to make my own BHO.
[08:39.230 --> 08:44.230]  Go to a school or a library and grab a basic organic chemistry book
[08:44.230 --> 08:46.230]  and sit down and read that shit.
[08:46.230 --> 08:51.230]  Then introduce the cannabis later once you understand what you're dealing with
[08:51.230 --> 08:53.230]  and how to respect it.
[08:53.230 --> 08:55.230]  See, I think that's a good approach.
[08:55.230 --> 08:59.230]  And then after that, read some forums and don't watch a single video
[08:59.230 --> 09:03.230]  until you have an understanding and you feel like you can do it on your own.
[09:03.230 --> 09:07.230]  Make a batch or two if you feel confident and you have done those steps
[09:07.230 --> 09:09.230]  and done the reading and gained the knowledge.
[09:09.230 --> 09:11.230]  Then watch videos after you've already tried it
[09:11.230 --> 09:16.230]  because there's so much stupid shit that people do in those two-minute videos.
[09:16.230 --> 09:21.230]  If people are making a good batch of dabs, doesn't take two minutes.
[09:21.230 --> 09:23.230]  I don't care what your process is.
[09:23.230 --> 09:24.230]  Oh, no.
[09:24.230 --> 09:28.230]  So that's why I recommend doing the reading and the research.
[09:28.230 --> 09:31.230]  I've waited two or three days for this dude to bring me back dabs.
[09:31.230 --> 09:33.230]  It seems like the longer I wait, the better they are.
[09:33.230 --> 09:35.230]  Yeah, so it's well worth it.
[09:35.230 --> 09:36.230]  Yep, definitely.
[09:36.230 --> 09:38.230]  By all means, people, do your homework.
[09:38.230 --> 09:40.230]  The only reason people are getting hurt trying to make dabs
[09:40.230 --> 09:44.230]  is because they heard about it from a friend
[09:44.230 --> 09:46.230]  and the friend didn't really know what they were talking about.
[09:46.230 --> 09:50.230]  And then they ran to the parts store, bought a bunch of flammable chemicals,
[09:50.230 --> 09:53.230]  took them into an enclosed space, and set all the fumes on fire.
[09:53.230 --> 09:54.230]  I've talked to countless people.
[09:54.230 --> 09:55.230]  It's literally the dumbest shit ever.
[09:55.230 --> 09:58.230]  If you do any research at all,
[09:58.230 --> 10:01.230]  you learn how to not blow yourself up in the first two minutes.
[10:03.230 --> 10:05.230]  It's about respecting what you're dealing with.
[10:05.230 --> 10:06.230]  Yeah, don't blast indoors.
[10:06.230 --> 10:08.230]  That's my number one piece of advice.
[10:08.230 --> 10:12.230]  I'm not a hash maker, but my number one piece of advice is do not blast indoors.
[10:12.230 --> 10:14.230]  It's ridiculous.
[10:15.230 --> 10:20.230]  So, for you, Kev, what kind of mark do you want to leave on the cannabis industry?
[10:20.230 --> 10:22.230]  Or the society or cannabis world?
[10:22.230 --> 10:23.230]  What kind of mark do you want to leave?
[10:23.230 --> 10:30.230]  I'd like to just keep continuing with the main attitude that most of us have
[10:30.230 --> 10:39.230]  and just continue that positive outlook and that positive view from the people as well.
[10:39.230 --> 10:43.230]  Just keep doing everything as best as I can with the most knowledge
[10:43.230 --> 10:48.230]  and learning everything as it comes to light, as everything's changing.
[10:48.230 --> 10:51.230]  Just always keep up with that and share that with the people around me,
[10:51.230 --> 10:54.230]  because that's how we get better, is by sharing the knowledge that we have.
[10:54.230 --> 10:55.230]  For sure.
[10:55.230 --> 10:59.230]  That's how we prevent blowing up, is by sharing knowledge.
[10:59.230 --> 11:01.230]  I know you're doing a lot of work in the cannabis industry.
[11:01.230 --> 11:04.230]  You're not a grower, you're not a hash maker, but you're on the other end.
[11:04.230 --> 11:07.230]  You're the computer nerd that we all need.
[11:07.230 --> 11:08.230]  You're an activist on that end.
[11:08.230 --> 11:10.230]  You do a lot of stuff on the—should I say where you do it?
[11:10.230 --> 11:11.230]  Sure.
[11:11.230 --> 11:12.230]  Go ahead.
[11:12.230 --> 11:13.230]  You do a lot of stuff from what I know on the HuffPost.
[11:13.230 --> 11:15.230]  I see you tweeting a lot of cool stuff about cannabis.
[11:15.230 --> 11:17.230]  You're an activist in my mind.
[11:17.230 --> 11:19.230]  That's part of why I wanted to have you on my show.
[11:19.230 --> 11:20.230]  That's so cool.
[11:20.230 --> 11:22.230]  Yeah, bro, you do that stuff and I appreciate it.
[11:22.230 --> 11:23.230]  I need that stuff.
[11:23.230 --> 11:24.230]  I'm busy in the grow.
[11:24.230 --> 11:25.230]  The whole Kev's making hash.
[11:25.230 --> 11:26.230]  We need you to speak for us.
[11:26.230 --> 11:28.230]  You're well-written, well-spoken.
[11:28.230 --> 11:33.230]  I like to think of the last five years as working on a doctorate in cannabis,
[11:33.230 --> 11:38.230]  but other people might call it unemployed or self-employed or weed-employed.
[11:38.230 --> 11:40.230]  You're canna-employed.
[11:40.230 --> 11:41.230]  I'm canna-employed.
[11:41.230 --> 11:43.230]  Canna and canna-employed at the same time.
[11:43.230 --> 11:44.230]  I like that.
[11:44.230 --> 11:46.230]  What kind of mark do you want to leave?
[11:46.230 --> 11:49.230]  When you're gone, when the earth blows up and somebody reads a book about Mike,
[11:49.230 --> 11:50.230]  what do you want it to say?
[11:50.230 --> 11:55.230]  Honestly, it would be amazing if my name was in some of the history books
[11:55.230 --> 11:59.230]  as part of this huge experiment going on in Colorado right now
[11:59.230 --> 12:03.230]  about one of the first big names to do it incredibly right.
[12:03.230 --> 12:06.230]  If I could just put you two in a warehouse and chain you there for a year,
[12:06.230 --> 12:08.230]  that would be done.
[12:08.230 --> 12:12.230]  Mike would run the front, me on the grow, Kev on the hash.
[12:12.230 --> 12:15.230]  Right, if I could just enslave you two and keep Jeff in the garden
[12:15.230 --> 12:17.230]  and Kev in the hash room.
[12:17.230 --> 12:19.230]  I'd have to chain myself to the front desk too.
[12:19.230 --> 12:20.230]  If they can't leave, I can't leave.
[12:20.230 --> 12:21.230]  That's just fair.
[12:22.230 --> 12:24.230]  If that could happen, my name would fully be cemented in history
[12:24.230 --> 12:29.230]  as the fucking Golden Coors Brewery of Southern Colorado.
[12:29.230 --> 12:30.230]  I know that for a fact.
[12:30.230 --> 12:31.230]  That would be way cool.
[12:31.230 --> 12:32.230]  That would be way cool to have.
[12:32.230 --> 12:35.230]  It would be way cool to see one of my bros accomplish that sort of thing.
[12:35.230 --> 12:36.230]  That would be a lot of fun.
[12:36.230 --> 12:38.230]  Yeah, definitely.
[12:38.230 --> 12:40.230]  It would be so much fun to play King of the Mountain
[12:40.230 --> 12:43.230]  and just sell weed with you two for the rest of my life.
[12:43.230 --> 12:45.230]  Are we going to have other people or is it just the three of us?
[12:45.230 --> 12:50.230]  We're going to have to hire a whole bunch of helpers.
[12:50.230 --> 12:52.230]  Can we have some Oompa Loompas and whatnots?
[12:52.230 --> 12:54.230]  Yeah, we'll need some of those.
[12:54.230 --> 12:56.230]  We're going to have to teach them better songs, but yes,
[12:56.230 --> 12:58.230]  I like the idea of Oompa Loompas.
[12:58.230 --> 13:01.230]  Little people and or…
[13:01.230 --> 13:03.230]  Dude, I don't care if we hire.
[13:03.230 --> 13:04.230]  I'll hire anybody, bro.
[13:04.230 --> 13:06.230]  We'll just eat weed leaves all day.
[13:06.230 --> 13:08.230]  Eat the trim?
[13:08.230 --> 13:09.230]  No.
[13:09.230 --> 13:11.230]  Instead of cocoa leaves, we're just chewing on weed leaves.
[13:11.230 --> 13:14.230]  We'll hire a pretty girl to go get you Rasta Pasta
[13:14.230 --> 13:17.230]  and I don't know what Kevin eats, Anthony's.
[13:17.230 --> 13:20.230]  Kevin wants some Rasta Pasta.
[13:20.230 --> 13:23.230]  They did not pay for that.
[13:23.230 --> 13:25.230]  Nope, that was a free promo.
[13:25.230 --> 13:28.230]  If you're a meat eater and want a weed job,
[13:28.230 --> 13:30.230]  I suppose you should call me so I have someone to go to lunch with.
[13:30.230 --> 13:32.230]  Yeah, Mike is not a…
[13:32.230 --> 13:34.230]  Well, Kevin eats the carnivore stuff.
[13:34.230 --> 13:35.230]  I'm one of those hippie types, y'all.
[13:35.230 --> 13:36.230]  I don't eat any animals.
[13:36.230 --> 13:39.230]  Got a bunch of people that just met us or just tuned in.
[13:39.230 --> 13:42.230]  He doesn't mean grilled cheese by that, folks.
[13:42.230 --> 13:44.230]  That doesn't count as a veggie option.
[13:44.230 --> 13:45.230]  That's a lot of falafel.
[13:45.230 --> 13:47.230]  It's hippie shit, man.
[13:47.230 --> 13:48.230]  All right.
[13:48.230 --> 13:50.230]  Well, we have a topic we want to discuss.
[13:50.230 --> 13:53.230]  I'm going to put it back on a serious note here.
[13:53.230 --> 13:57.230]  A recent article that came out written by Ricardo Baca in the Denver Post,
[13:57.230 --> 14:01.230]  an independent Denver Post study of several marijuana-infused products
[14:01.230 --> 14:06.230]  shows wide variances in THC levels in edibles versus labeling.
[14:06.230 --> 14:11.230]  So, what that means is apparently they acquired some edibles
[14:11.230 --> 14:13.230]  and they took them to a testing facility.
[14:13.230 --> 14:16.230]  They took them to Steep Hill Halent Labs and they tested them,
[14:16.230 --> 14:20.230]  and the labels did not match the test findings.
[14:20.230 --> 14:22.230]  So, I'm going to read a little bit further for you guys.
[14:22.230 --> 14:23.230]  Take a big breath before I do.
[14:23.230 --> 14:25.230]  I had a couple dabs before the show.
[14:25.230 --> 14:26.230]  Sorry about the wobbly voice.
[14:26.230 --> 14:29.230]  I'm trying to read out loud on a microphone.
[14:29.230 --> 14:32.230]  So, it says, as one of the largest producers of marijuana-infused edibles in Colorado,
[14:32.230 --> 14:36.230]  Dr. J's Hash Infusion makes chocolates, caramels, and candies,
[14:36.230 --> 14:41.230]  but many of the company's products contain only a minute fraction of the THC promised on Dr. J's labels.
[14:41.230 --> 14:46.230]  According to independent tests organized by the Denver Post,
[14:46.230 --> 14:51.230]  one Dr. J's milk chocolate stars bar labeled for 1,000 mg of THC had,
[14:51.230 --> 14:56.230]  and pay attention here, 0.37 mg of valued psychoactive component.
[14:56.230 --> 14:59.230]  According to three tests conducted by Steep Hill Halent of Colorado,
[14:59.230 --> 15:02.230]  a state-licensed marijuana testing facility,
[15:02.230 --> 15:08.230]  another popular Dr. J's chocolate bar, the 100 mg winter mint flavor.
[15:08.230 --> 15:09.230]  Oh, the page is refreshing.
[15:09.230 --> 15:10.230]  That's cute.
[15:10.230 --> 15:11.230]  Scroll the heck down.
[15:11.230 --> 15:12.230]  There we go.
[15:12.230 --> 15:19.230]  Winter mint flavor tested similarly in two experiments showing 0.28 mg of THC.
[15:19.230 --> 15:26.230]  So, basically, these chocolate bars cost about $10 plus tax,
[15:26.230 --> 15:30.230]  and they promised to have 100 mg of THC in there.
[15:30.230 --> 15:34.230]  And you basically just bought a Hershey bar, or I can't, I don't know, I shouldn't say a brand name.
[15:34.230 --> 15:38.230]  You bought a regular chocolate bar off of the shelf is basically what you got.
[15:38.230 --> 15:44.230]  At least the regular dollar chocolate bar up by the register at the Quickway is standardized
[15:44.230 --> 15:47.230]  and, like, is always going to be kind of what you ordered.
[15:47.230 --> 15:51.230]  The stuff they're cooking in their kitchens, if they can't get the THC that they're trying to put in it,
[15:51.230 --> 15:55.230]  does it even taste like food or does it just taste like boot leather?
[15:55.230 --> 16:00.230]  Dude, at those numbers, you need 100 of those things to get one normal 25 mg dose.
[16:00.230 --> 16:01.230]  Right.
[16:01.230 --> 16:02.230]  Like, yeah.
[16:02.230 --> 16:05.230]  At that point, you're dying of diabetes trying to treat whatever you're going to treat with weed.
[16:05.230 --> 16:08.230]  $1,000 to edible with weed for one dose.
[16:08.230 --> 16:09.230]  So, you're going to have diabetes.
[16:09.230 --> 16:11.230]  Yeah, you're going to be fat and funky.
[16:11.230 --> 16:12.230]  That's ridiculous.
[16:12.230 --> 16:14.230]  So, I'm going to continue on.
[16:14.230 --> 16:19.230]  It says they need to work on their process, says Joseph Evans, Laboratory Director at Steep Hill Halent,
[16:19.230 --> 16:20.230]  who's a really cool guy, by the way.
[16:20.230 --> 16:21.230]  Shout out to the guys at Steep Hill Halent.
[16:21.230 --> 16:23.230]  I've met those guys a couple times.
[16:23.230 --> 16:30.230]  They've been attacked over this, and everything I've heard and known about Steep Hill Halent is all gold star type information.
[16:30.230 --> 16:32.230]  I've never heard anybody whine about anything from them.
[16:32.230 --> 16:33.230]  Check it out.
[16:33.230 --> 16:34.230]  I know those guys personally.
[16:34.230 --> 16:35.230]  I've met Penny.
[16:35.230 --> 16:36.230]  They're friends of mine.
[16:36.230 --> 16:37.230]  They're business partners of mine.
[16:37.230 --> 16:39.230]  I have my products tested with Steep Hill.
[16:39.230 --> 16:47.230]  Grimey Gatsby, Joseph Evans, and Addison DeMora are the three guys that I'm friends with there.
[16:47.230 --> 16:48.230]  Straight up dudes.
[16:48.230 --> 16:50.230]  They have no reason to lie, no reason to make anything up.
[16:50.230 --> 16:51.230]  They do good business.
[16:51.230 --> 16:53.230]  They're making our industry much better.
[16:53.230 --> 16:54.230]  They're improving every day.
[16:54.230 --> 16:55.230]  They're improving.
[16:55.230 --> 16:56.230]  Steep Hill Halent.
[16:56.230 --> 16:57.230]  All the way.
[16:57.230 --> 16:58.230]  They're improving every area.
[16:58.230 --> 16:59.230]  Thank you, guys.
[16:59.230 --> 17:00.230]  Every area of it.
[17:00.230 --> 17:02.230]  So, from me, from Kevin, too, thank you very much.
[17:02.230 --> 17:03.230]  I appreciate it coming to us.
[17:03.230 --> 17:08.230]  Yeah, this is just genuine appreciation from the community to the testing labs doing a good job.
[17:08.230 --> 17:12.230]  Joseph says, and check them out, Steep Hill Halent Labs.
[17:12.230 --> 17:14.230]  That's enough about that one.
[17:14.230 --> 17:18.230]  They say, they need to work on their process, says Joseph Evans, Laboratory Director at Steep Hill Halent.
[17:18.230 --> 17:24.230]  I don't know that it's irresponsible, but it's non-professional, which is pretty much how I feel.
[17:24.230 --> 17:25.230]  Yeah.
[17:25.230 --> 17:32.230]  The evolving marijuana industry is still finding its way in Colorado, and one of the evolving aspects is the testing or lack thereof products.
[17:32.230 --> 17:39.230]  The State Marijuana Enforcement Division enacted new regulations last week, and more changes are to come in May and in October.
[17:39.230 --> 17:44.230]  For people that aren't from Colorado or aren't familiar with all this, there's some mumbo-jumbo in here.
[17:44.230 --> 17:52.230]  The Marijuana Enforcement Division, that is the division that oversees all of the dispensary regulations, rules, and taxing.
[17:52.230 --> 17:54.230]  They're attached to the IRS.
[17:54.230 --> 17:59.230]  They're able to randomly show up at your dispensary on any day that business is being conducted.
[17:59.230 --> 18:01.230]  They can open up all your business records.
[18:01.230 --> 18:03.230]  They can open up all your saves.
[18:03.230 --> 18:04.230]  Saves?
[18:04.230 --> 18:05.230]  Safes?
[18:05.230 --> 18:06.230]  Saves.
[18:06.230 --> 18:07.230]  Yeah.
[18:07.230 --> 18:09.230]  The boxes where you keep money, they can open those.
[18:09.230 --> 18:11.230]  Inspect any and every part of the business.
[18:11.230 --> 18:13.230]  Cars in the parking lot, everything.
[18:13.230 --> 18:16.230]  Cars in the parking lot, they go through the bathrooms if they feel like it.
[18:16.230 --> 18:20.230]  If they find a roach or a pipe or something, you can be in trouble.
[18:20.230 --> 18:23.230]  I don't know exactly what they do about that, but you can be screwed.
[18:23.230 --> 18:29.230]  There are strict rules, and everything in these medical and recreational centers are under camera.
[18:30.230 --> 18:31.230]  Everything.
[18:31.230 --> 18:35.230]  From the minute you walk in the door to the minute you pay, your money is heavily on camera.
[18:35.230 --> 18:37.230]  Very high-tech camera systems, too.
[18:37.230 --> 18:41.230]  These aren't just harbor-fright cameras.
[18:41.230 --> 18:48.230]  You can zoom in on IDs and stuff with each of these cameras and read it perfectly.
[18:50.230 --> 18:54.230]  Yeah, they've got their stuff under control, and they're just popping in and inspecting places.
[18:55.230 --> 19:00.230]  That's the place that's involved and responsible for this, and they're coming out with new regulations all the time.
[19:00.230 --> 19:02.230]  They're trying to get it under control.
[19:02.230 --> 19:04.230]  I'll continue the article.
[19:04.230 --> 19:10.230]  As the marijuana industry looks ahead to the potential of regular mandatory testing, Dr. J's problems seem deeper than a bad batch or two.
[19:10.230 --> 19:18.230]  The two bars that both tested for less than half a milligram of THC were purchased two months and 40 miles apart from each other,
[19:18.230 --> 19:23.230]  and they were separated by 282 batches, or roughly 70,000 units.
[19:23.230 --> 19:26.230]  So this couldn't have been just a fluke batch or something.
[19:26.230 --> 19:31.230]  This was definitely, like, what do we call that?
[19:31.230 --> 19:32.230]  That's fucked up.
[19:32.230 --> 19:33.230]  That's definitely what it is.
[19:33.230 --> 19:36.230]  This is their business model being found out by the general public.
[19:36.230 --> 19:43.230]  It's like if 11 of the 12 pop cans in your 12-pack were empty, or just full of water.
[19:45.230 --> 19:46.230]  It's insane.
[19:46.230 --> 19:47.230]  It's insane.
[19:47.230 --> 19:54.230]  If they're 200 batches apart, that's a business practice, or a huge flaw in their business practice is it minimal.
[19:56.230 --> 20:04.230]  If you produce 100 batches of chocolate bars and there are that many with no weed in them, come on.
[20:04.230 --> 20:06.230]  Playing with the toys in front of me, dude.
[20:06.230 --> 20:08.230]  It's a kid news podcast, man. Take a dab.
[20:08.230 --> 20:09.230]  I'm like a little kid, dude.
[20:09.230 --> 20:12.230]  As long as I can keep talking, you can get dabbed the fuck out.
[20:12.230 --> 20:15.230]  Shout out to Phong who made the cool-ass torch that we're using.
[20:15.230 --> 20:16.230]  That thing's awesome.
[20:18.230 --> 20:19.230]  I'm going to read a little bit.
[20:19.230 --> 20:24.230]  I have something to add to what you were saying, but I want to read a little bit more and get through this article before we rant too much and get distracted.
[20:25.230 --> 20:26.230]  He has a little header.
[20:26.230 --> 20:27.230]  It says, enter enforcement agency.
[20:27.230 --> 20:31.230]  Hundreds of customers have complained about Dr. J's products.
[20:31.230 --> 20:34.230]  At least three recreational pot shops dropped the brand entirely.
[20:34.230 --> 20:35.230]  Others said they won't carry them.
[20:37.230 --> 20:40.230]  And the grousing has the attention of the medical marijuana enforcement division.
[20:40.230 --> 20:43.230]  I've got to turn down your mic because that thing is going to be crazy loud, but go for it.
[20:43.230 --> 20:44.230]  I can learn how to do it today.
[20:47.230 --> 20:49.230]  I tried to drop that torch out of there. Sorry, y'all.
[20:49.230 --> 20:55.230]  An independent post-study of several products showed the THC levels in edibles are never exactly what the package reads.
[20:55.230 --> 20:57.230]  So, that's never a good sign.
[20:58.230 --> 20:59.230]  That's never a good sign.
[20:59.230 --> 21:06.230]  So, Mile High's candies, watermelon drops are labeled at 100 mg of THC, but they actually contained 17.
[21:07.230 --> 21:09.230]  That's a failure in my mind.
[21:09.230 --> 21:10.230]  That's a huge failure.
[21:10.230 --> 21:17.230]  Incredible's Mile High Mint Chocolate Bar advertises 100 mg of THC, but instead included 146.
[21:17.230 --> 21:20.230]  Now, keep that in your mind for a minute because I want to read the next one.
[21:20.230 --> 21:22.230]  Big shout out to The Growing Kitchen.
[21:22.230 --> 21:30.230]  The Growing Kitchen's chocolate chunk cookie tested at 101 mg on a product labeled for 100.
[21:30.230 --> 21:32.230]  So, they were 1 mg off.
[21:33.230 --> 21:35.230]  That's doing it right, in my opinion.
[21:35.230 --> 21:37.230]  Good job, guys. Big love to The Growing Kitchen.
[21:37.230 --> 21:39.230]  Check those guys out. Buy their edibles.
[21:39.230 --> 21:41.230]  The chocolate chunk cookie, it's fucking what it's at.
[21:42.230 --> 21:50.230]  So, something I've said to keep in your head, 146 mg in an edible that's listed at 100.
[21:50.230 --> 21:52.230]  You're getting one and a half times your dose.
[21:52.230 --> 21:53.230]  I'm okay with that.
[21:54.230 --> 21:58.230]  You and me are, but the general public, that's...
[21:58.230 --> 21:59.230]  I'm a caregiver.
[21:59.230 --> 22:02.230]  I'm a registered caregiver for five patients.
[22:02.230 --> 22:07.230]  And I have two people that if I fed them that, they would probably get mad at me.
[22:09.230 --> 22:11.230]  It could definitely...
[22:11.230 --> 22:18.230]  If I had stuff to do that day and I was expecting, say, half of 100 mg dose to start my day off with,
[22:18.230 --> 22:25.230]  and I really got 75 instead of 50 by half of that, that could mess up a good portion of my day.
[22:25.230 --> 22:27.230]  This is medical marijuana.
[22:27.230 --> 22:28.230]  Yeah, it should be standardized.
[22:28.230 --> 22:29.230]  A regulated, tested product.
[22:30.230 --> 22:34.230]  What if this company gave me a Vicodin?
[22:34.230 --> 22:37.230]  And I just thought I took... It's a 750 mg.
[22:37.230 --> 22:39.230]  I almost just took... What was that?
[22:39.230 --> 22:40.230]  A thousand?
[22:40.230 --> 22:41.230]  A thousand mg, right?
[22:41.230 --> 22:43.230]  That's probably... I'm going to be fucked up.
[22:43.230 --> 22:45.230]  I can't go to work now.
[22:45.230 --> 22:46.230]  1250? I don't know.
[22:46.230 --> 22:49.230]  Whatever. Somebody... You guys get the damn point, please.
[22:52.230 --> 22:54.230]  No, I'm with you entirely.
[22:54.230 --> 22:55.230]  It's not a math bowl.
[22:55.230 --> 22:57.230]  I already forgot the numbers I said.
[22:57.230 --> 23:01.230]  This is a product of the industry being on the fringe still.
[23:01.230 --> 23:07.230]  We're only months removed from this industry being shunned by society completely.
[23:07.230 --> 23:15.230]  The people that went to school and learned the skills that it takes to put an exact number of mg of THC
[23:15.230 --> 23:23.230]  in a little fun-sized candy bar haven't moved into this industry and the numbers great enough
[23:23.230 --> 23:26.230]  to really provide awesome product standards across the board with edibles.
[23:26.230 --> 23:31.230]  Clearly, who came in one above and one off?
[23:31.230 --> 23:32.230]  The Growing Kitchen.
[23:32.230 --> 23:35.230]  The Growing Kitchen has got somebody who really knows what they're doing.
[23:35.230 --> 23:42.230]  I understand that the folks in charge of making the capsules and the oils of Charlotte's Web
[23:42.230 --> 23:48.230]  that were given to the kids with seizures have also taken great lengths to standardize their dose exactly.
[23:48.230 --> 23:52.230]  Clearly, other people haven't bothered to do any of that.
[23:53.230 --> 23:59.230]  They're trying, but a lot of this stuff came from mom-and-pop operations that had to grow and expand quickly.
[23:59.230 --> 24:06.230]  True, but if you're shooting for $100 and you're getting $15, either you're a moron or your math is seriously flawed.
[24:06.230 --> 24:12.230]  Did I skip the paragraph where the owner of that company argued saying that they had to be better?
[24:12.230 --> 24:15.230]  I may have skipped a paragraph. I apologize if I did. I'm skimming through.
[24:15.230 --> 24:17.230]  Immediately when this story broke, yeah.
[24:17.230 --> 24:18.230]  Do you want to keep reading?
[24:18.230 --> 24:19.230]  I'll shut up.
[24:19.230 --> 24:21.230]  No, keep going because you're going to cover what I missed.
[24:21.230 --> 24:26.230]  When the story broke, the first day it was published on the Denver Post and in the Cannabis,
[24:26.230 --> 24:29.230]  the industry responded immediately with,
[24:29.230 --> 24:35.230]  they're lying or their testing methods were off or some other nonsense.
[24:35.230 --> 24:36.230]  Here's his quote. He said,
[24:36.230 --> 24:40.230]  I would be in shock if those tests were accurate, said Dr. J's CEO.
[24:40.230 --> 24:44.230]  I'm not going to butcher your last name. His name's Tom.
[24:44.230 --> 24:46.230]  We're on top of the business in Colorado.
[24:46.230 --> 24:50.230]  I wouldn't be in business this long if we weren't doing things right 99% of the time.
[24:51.230 --> 24:55.230]  I think 99% of the people for the last year just didn't know what they were buying.
[24:59.330 --> 25:01.330]  I'm speechless on your answer. Sorry.
[25:01.330 --> 25:04.330]  I paused and nodded and nobody on a podcast can see me pause and nod.
[25:04.330 --> 25:07.330]  If it was any other, I mean, I go back to if it was any other product.
[25:07.330 --> 25:10.330]  If somebody told you that, you know,
[25:10.330 --> 25:13.330]  two out of four Fords just burst into flames on the road,
[25:13.330 --> 25:15.330]  would you ever even consider buying one again?
[25:15.330 --> 25:17.330]  That's fucked up. I've been looking at a Ford.
[25:17.330 --> 25:20.330]  Sorry, but that's not true Ford. I love you.
[25:20.330 --> 25:22.330]  I've driven many Fords for many years.
[25:22.330 --> 25:24.330]  That was a hypothetical. Thank you for not suing us.
[25:24.330 --> 25:26.330]  But like, it's just silly.
[25:26.330 --> 25:30.330]  If you can't produce a standardized product,
[25:30.330 --> 25:34.330]  you need to rethink what you're doing and reset your kitchen up.
[25:34.330 --> 25:36.330]  Clearly they're failing miserably.
[25:36.330 --> 25:41.330]  And now anyone in Colorado can just walk into a testing facility and say,
[25:41.330 --> 25:44.330]  I think this chocolate bar is bunk. I saved two bites. Test it for me.
[25:44.330 --> 25:46.330]  That's true.
[25:46.330 --> 25:48.330]  And I mean, it's going to cost them a few bucks,
[25:48.330 --> 25:52.330]  but if I go to about a hundred dollars, I think it,
[25:52.330 --> 25:57.330]  you'll get more in a lawsuit saying I've tried to buy my medicine from Dr.
[25:57.330 --> 26:00.330]  J and Dr. J shafted me. That's a good point.
[26:00.330 --> 26:01.330]  Well,
[26:01.330 --> 26:04.330]  I bet you a lot of dispensaries are going to drop Dr. J before too long and
[26:04.330 --> 26:09.330]  I'd be surprised if that company is operating under that management and under
[26:09.330 --> 26:13.330]  that name in six months, six months, ladies and gentlemen,
[26:13.330 --> 26:17.330]  today is the day after St. Patrick's day, March 18th, March 18th.
[26:17.330 --> 26:19.330]  So this won't go out for a little while.
[26:19.330 --> 26:22.330]  I'm going to try to put a couple episodes together before I throw them out
[26:22.330 --> 26:26.330]  there, get my shit together before I run. So a Colorado medical or marijuana
[26:26.330 --> 26:28.330]  industry leader, I'm getting back into the article, by the way,
[26:28.330 --> 26:30.330]  Colorado marijuana industry leader,
[26:30.330 --> 26:34.330]  Dixie elixirs tested at 60 milligrams of THC with its Dixie rolls in the post
[26:34.330 --> 26:36.330]  study, which are labeled at 100 milligrams.
[26:36.330 --> 26:40.330]  That's 60% of what you're paying for. That's wrong.
[26:40.330 --> 26:42.330]  It is wrong.
[26:42.330 --> 26:45.330]  So let's, if I went to let's, where's, uh,
[26:46.330 --> 26:49.330]  if I went to what, if you stopped at a fast food restaurant on your way here,
[26:49.330 --> 26:52.330]  where would you have gone to get like a drink or some sort of beverage?
[26:52.330 --> 26:55.330]  I don't do a lot of the fast food joint. Well, I'm going to say Taco Bell.
[26:55.330 --> 26:57.330]  We're going to say burger bell.
[26:57.330 --> 26:59.330]  We're just going to make up a spot called burger bell.
[26:59.330 --> 27:03.330]  If you stopped at fucking burger bell and you took off the lid and your drink
[27:03.330 --> 27:07.330]  was only three quarters or 60% of the way full, you'd go back.
[27:07.330 --> 27:12.330]  Can you be like, can you spit in this and fill it the rest of the way up?
[27:12.330 --> 27:14.330]  You know, they're going to spit that fucker. If you're right.
[27:14.330 --> 27:16.330]  No, if it was any other industry,
[27:16.330 --> 27:18.330]  none of these things would be acceptable at all.
[27:18.330 --> 27:21.330]  None of these things would be acceptable. None whatsoever.
[27:21.330 --> 27:23.330]  You got 60% of your dinner. It, it,
[27:23.330 --> 27:27.330]  Arby's or 60% of the gasoline you're stepping up.
[27:27.330 --> 27:29.330]  I'm proud of somebody for stepping up and doing this.
[27:29.330 --> 27:33.330]  Thanks to the Denver post for doing it and the steep hill. So while, uh,
[27:33.330 --> 27:37.330]  continue while we were disappointed to learn that the learn of the post test
[27:37.330 --> 27:41.330]  results, we also know that testing can vary significantly from one lab to the
[27:41.330 --> 27:43.330]  next. Dixie elixirs.
[27:43.330 --> 27:46.330]  That's hard to say when you're dabbed out and reading quickly.
[27:46.330 --> 27:49.330]  Dixie elixir CEO Joe Hoda said, regardless,
[27:49.330 --> 27:53.330]  we will continue to focus on our quality control to be sure all of our products
[27:53.330 --> 27:58.330]  from edibles to tinctures and topicals reflect agreed upon milligrams of THC.
[27:58.330 --> 28:01.330]  So from here on out, they, they're going to do their best.
[28:01.330 --> 28:03.330]  They say maybe they can regain their shit.
[28:03.330 --> 28:06.330]  I see a lot of freebies somewhere from Dr. J's.
[28:06.330 --> 28:09.330]  You're gonna have to give a shit ton of stuff away, man.
[28:09.330 --> 28:14.330]  I'm really hoping this shakes through the whole industry in Colorado from the
[28:14.330 --> 28:17.330]  edibles companies that have clearly been doing some shady business for the last
[28:17.330 --> 28:19.330]  several years, uh,
[28:19.330 --> 28:24.330]  down to the shops that have been saying they've got, you know,
[28:24.330 --> 28:30.330]  their Torah Bora tested. I don't know what, 10% THC, 10% CBD.
[28:30.330 --> 28:35.330]  Like they've been able to claim whatever without the public having any real
[28:35.330 --> 28:36.330]  recourse to test that. Right.
[28:36.330 --> 28:41.330]  And like if your beer says it was at 3.3% and it could be at any percent,
[28:41.330 --> 28:43.330]  like that causes real problems in society.
[28:44.330 --> 28:47.330]  Like having this being standard is a good thing.
[28:47.330 --> 28:50.330]  It's part of the awesomeness that comes with legalization.
[28:50.330 --> 28:54.330]  None of this was possible five years ago. Yeah. Yeah.
[28:54.330 --> 28:56.330]  Part of the revolution boys and girls.
[28:56.330 --> 29:00.330]  Knowledge that's coming out now is possible because of legalization, right?
[29:00.330 --> 29:04.330]  We can have these labs like Steve Hill that can test stuff for us and give us
[29:05.330 --> 29:07.330]  good results and standardized results.
[29:07.330 --> 29:10.330]  I've seen a tour of their facility and it's impressive. It's really awesome.
[29:11.330 --> 29:12.330]  Yeah. Independent testing labs.
[29:12.330 --> 29:15.330]  One of the first thing that sprang up alongside the legal weed industry in
[29:15.330 --> 29:16.330]  Colorado.
[29:16.330 --> 29:20.330]  And it was really cool to see that that became like a foundational component to
[29:20.330 --> 29:23.330]  it. It's just sad that the edible companies have done such a bad job
[29:23.330 --> 29:27.330]  standardizing so far. Well, they can't now, you know, maybe now they know it.
[29:27.330 --> 29:30.330]  My mic sounds weird in my headphones. I apologize if it sounds goofy to your
[29:30.330 --> 29:31.330]  ears. We'll fix that.
[29:31.330 --> 29:34.330]  Fix it in post. All right, I'll continue.
[29:35.330 --> 29:38.330]  It says, but of the 10 edibles tested in the exclusive post report,
[29:38.330 --> 29:41.330]  no edible had the THC level problems of Dr. J's.
[29:41.330 --> 29:45.330]  Evan said you're taking less than a milligram of THC in a product that says
[29:45.330 --> 29:49.330]  100. Evan said, if people have no confidence in the industry,
[29:49.330 --> 29:53.330]  then there could be a sort of backlash against the whole legal marijuana
[29:53.330 --> 29:56.330]  movement. Yep. So I'm going to finish the article.
[29:56.330 --> 29:57.330]  It's one paragraph says,
[29:57.330 --> 30:00.330]  how can these numbers be so high that they're not even worth the money?
[30:00.330 --> 30:03.330]  It says, how can these numbers be so disparate while there's been much
[30:03.330 --> 30:05.330]  discussion over testing guidelines?
[30:05.330 --> 30:08.330]  It's still a voluntary action for growers and makers of marijuana infused
[30:08.330 --> 30:12.330]  products or MIPs. So again, I just want to give credit to,
[30:12.330 --> 30:16.330]  who's the homie that wrote it. Ricardo Baca from the Denver post.
[30:16.330 --> 30:20.330]  Now what they tested was Bang Fire Chocolate Bar.
[30:21.330 --> 30:23.330]  I've had that. That's a tastiness right there.
[30:23.330 --> 30:27.330]  It listed 180 milligrams. It actually had 156 milligrams.
[30:27.330 --> 30:31.330]  Not too bad. It's a lot closer than some of the other ones on it.
[30:31.330 --> 30:33.330]  It's a lot closer. Yeah. I'm going to give that one a six.
[30:33.330 --> 30:36.330]  I'll give that one a thumbs up. That's cool. That's you missed it by a little bit,
[30:36.330 --> 30:39.330]  but I mean, compared to the competition, what the hell can I say?
[30:39.330 --> 30:43.330]  So Dr. J's bars, the milk chocolate listed a hundred milligrams.
[30:43.330 --> 30:48.330]  Guess how many bro? Point four point four. That's ridiculous.
[30:48.330 --> 30:52.330]  Ridonkulous if that's acceptable. Yeah. That's a peon.
[30:52.330 --> 30:56.330]  So what if you bought that? What dude people are relying. Okay.
[30:56.330 --> 31:00.330]  Keep going. Right. Dr. J's star bars, winter mint chocolate, point three.
[31:00.330 --> 31:04.330]  They claim to have a hundred Dr. J's star bars, white chocolate claim to have a hundred.
[31:04.330 --> 31:10.330]  Look, they stepped it up. They got five out of a hundred, five percent,
[31:10.330 --> 31:14.330]  like five milligrams. That's their Dr. J's highest test score was five percent.
[31:14.330 --> 31:17.330]  That's why I was excited for five milligrams. Five milligrams.
[31:17.330 --> 31:20.330]  It's five percent because it's a hundred. So that's accurate for that one.
[31:20.330 --> 31:25.330]  Dr. J's jelly stones. They list a hundred. They got point two.
[31:25.330 --> 31:29.330]  Point two. Dude, if you owed me a hundred dollars and I showed up,
[31:29.330 --> 31:32.330]  what's that? Twenty cents. If I showed up with 20 cents and threw it on the table,
[31:32.330 --> 31:36.330]  would you punch me in the damn mouth? Maybe not for the mouth for 20 of a point.
[31:36.330 --> 31:43.330]  Well taken. Like, what the? It's it. It's irresponsible business.
[31:43.330 --> 31:47.330]  If any other industry did this, they would. If your new car showed up with no seats,
[31:47.330 --> 31:52.330]  no tires, no engine, no brakes, no brakes. Like, come on. I'm a caregiver.
[31:52.330 --> 31:57.330]  I'm in this. I fell in love. I worked at it as I was a grower. I was in love with weed.
[31:57.330 --> 32:01.330]  I've been smoking weed for years before I should admit it.
[32:01.330 --> 32:05.330]  I fell in love with cannabis years ago. I became an employee manager.
[32:05.330 --> 32:09.330]  I ran a dispensary. I fell in love with watching people fall in love with cannabis
[32:09.330 --> 32:14.330]  and watch it improve their lives. I'm a caregiver. I am involved in cannabis.
[32:14.330 --> 32:16.330]  I breed cannabis. I like watching people feel better.
[32:16.330 --> 32:19.330]  The people I'm responsible for that I'm a caregiver have,
[32:19.330 --> 32:23.330]  they have fucked up conditions that I see. I see it. I'm their friends.
[32:23.330 --> 32:28.330]  And I watch them get better consuming the medicine that I produced.
[32:28.330 --> 32:33.330]  That's what I'm in it for. When you're producing an edible that's listed to have 100 milligrams
[32:33.330 --> 32:39.330]  and only has five, you're taking money from a sick fucking person, first of all.
[32:39.330 --> 32:41.330]  A person that no matter who you are, you work hard for your money.
[32:41.330 --> 32:45.330]  No matter what you do, now you work hard for your money.
[32:45.330 --> 32:48.330]  Well, most of us work hard for our money. There are some people that I've worked hard for.
[32:48.330 --> 32:49.330]  Some of us work less hard than others.
[32:49.330 --> 32:53.330]  Yes. And some of us have mommy and daddy's money, but that's a whole nother podcast.
[32:53.330 --> 32:56.330]  You're ripping people off. You're taking money out of hardworking people
[32:56.330 --> 33:00.330]  that trusted you to take care of them. And now they aren't medicated.
[33:00.330 --> 33:05.330]  What about people like Brave Michaela? What about people that needed medicine?
[33:05.330 --> 33:08.330]  What about people like Cash Hyde that rely on that sort of thing?
[33:08.330 --> 33:10.330]  And sorry to bring up people that have passed and people that are sick,
[33:10.330 --> 33:14.330]  but those people needed medicine. And if you give them, this will help you.
[33:14.330 --> 33:15.330]  That's Charlotte's Web.
[33:15.330 --> 33:19.330]  Exactly. What was the girl's name from Utah that was doing the Charlotte's Web?
[33:19.330 --> 33:22.330]  Sorry to disrespect, but that's people, a good example.
[33:22.330 --> 33:26.330]  If we gave them medicine that was not what we promised to give them,
[33:26.330 --> 33:29.330]  they're not going to get medicated and they're going to get sick again.
[33:29.330 --> 33:34.330]  They'll go into remission and we just rip them off and gave them cancer all over again.
[33:34.330 --> 33:38.330]  And that's fucked up in my mind. That's not love. That's not compassion.
[33:38.330 --> 33:39.330]  That's dollar signs.
[33:39.330 --> 33:42.330]  Dr. J, I just want to give you guys the opportunity to redeem yourselves.
[33:42.330 --> 33:45.330]  I can't bash you a hundred percent. I'm not a scientist. I don't work for your company.
[33:45.330 --> 33:51.330]  I want you guys to get it back together. I'd like to see you come through and redeem yourselves.
[33:51.330 --> 33:52.330]  Please.
[33:52.330 --> 33:57.330]  Well, you know, the Denver Post isn't done with this. In six months, they're going to do the same thing.
[33:57.330 --> 33:59.330]  They're going to send the reporters to 15 or 20 shops.
[33:59.330 --> 34:03.330]  They're going to buy up a selection of edibles from different shops.
[34:03.330 --> 34:06.330]  And they're going to take them back to Steep Hill and one of the other testing labs.
[34:06.330 --> 34:09.330]  And this report's coming out again every couple of months.
[34:09.330 --> 34:10.330]  I hope so.
[34:10.330 --> 34:15.330]  Well, it comes back with 80 or 90 percent of the products tested are scoring right where they should.
[34:15.330 --> 34:21.330]  I mean, there's no reason that – I mean, edibles have always been hit or miss.
[34:21.330 --> 34:27.330]  But when you're working in a kitchen trying to make can of butter or can of oil
[34:27.330 --> 34:32.330]  and then make them into an edible product for you and a couple of friends, the process is different.
[34:32.330 --> 34:39.330]  And being unevenly dispersed throughout the batch is less important.
[34:39.330 --> 34:41.330]  And that's sort of always been true with edibles.
[34:41.330 --> 34:45.330]  You can make a tray of brownies. One brownie will wreck you for 30 hours.
[34:45.330 --> 34:47.330]  Another brownie won't do anything.
[34:47.330 --> 34:53.330]  But when you're selling it as a medicine and as a standardized product in the store, it can't waver.
[34:53.330 --> 34:57.330]  Your 10 milligrams should always be a 10. Your 100 should always be a 100.
[34:57.330 --> 35:00.330]  If not, you're going to kill people on accident.
[35:00.330 --> 35:03.330]  Get up on your mic a little bit, bro, please.
[35:03.330 --> 35:06.330]  When we were bullshitting around about this conversation.
[35:06.330 --> 35:08.330]  You look so comfortable though.
[35:08.330 --> 35:15.330]  We – like Jeff and I had had a conversation right after he came back from meeting the guys at Steep Hill
[35:15.330 --> 35:22.330]  about how your terpene molecules and things like that can be dispersed differently throughout your slab of hash.
[35:22.330 --> 35:26.330]  That's why depending on what part of the slab of hash you give them, it can be dispersed differently.
[35:26.330 --> 35:27.330]  Non-homogenous sample.
[35:27.330 --> 35:28.330]  So there you go.
[35:28.330 --> 35:29.330]  Yes, every tension.
[35:29.330 --> 35:35.330]  So I think that could also be true with the can of butters and the can of oils.
[35:35.330 --> 35:37.330]  It all gets dispersed differently.
[35:37.330 --> 35:47.330]  So when you make it, it is very difficult to get that completely spread across the board.
[35:47.330 --> 35:54.330]  Kevin has brought me slabs of hash that – and sometimes I get 10 to 30 grams from him.
[35:54.330 --> 35:55.330]  Sometimes when he does it –
[35:55.330 --> 35:58.330]  He's making the shape of a pie plate or a Frisbee with his hands.
[35:58.330 --> 35:59.330]  Yeah, with my hands.
[35:59.330 --> 36:01.330]  For those of you who can't see through the radio.
[36:01.330 --> 36:04.330]  I was trying to measure how many grams that was while I did it too.
[36:05.330 --> 36:12.330]  Sometimes we can see the puddles of different – I don't know if it's terpenoids or flavonoids
[36:12.330 --> 36:16.330]  or there's another one that the name just left my head right now.
[36:16.330 --> 36:19.330]  Paleots I think is what they may be.
[36:19.330 --> 36:22.330]  I can't identify them by the puddles, but you could see that there's –
[36:22.330 --> 36:25.330]  and if you dab from different sections, they taste different.
[36:25.330 --> 36:26.330]  You can see it in there.
[36:26.330 --> 36:27.330]  Like different layers of stuff.
[36:27.330 --> 36:29.330]  Yeah, like different layers of the pie.
[36:29.330 --> 36:32.330]  It's different oils separating in different textures.
[36:32.330 --> 36:36.330]  That's a good defense for these edibles, and I agree with you there.
[36:36.330 --> 36:40.330]  Maybe they cooked them tipped up this way, horizontally.
[36:40.330 --> 36:41.330]  No, that's vertically.
[36:41.330 --> 36:45.330]  Maybe they cooked them vertically and all the goodies ran down to the bottom bite
[36:45.330 --> 36:47.330]  and they tested the top bite.
[36:47.330 --> 36:56.330]  But those edibles are not – 100 milligrams is too much of a dose for the recent person I've been treating.
[36:56.330 --> 36:57.330]  That's too much for him.
[36:57.330 --> 36:58.330]  He needs half of that.
[36:59.330 --> 37:02.330]  He expects to get half of it when he splits it in half.
[37:02.330 --> 37:05.330]  He doesn't think I'm going to get fucking roller coaster the first time
[37:05.330 --> 37:07.330]  and just be bored the second time.
[37:07.330 --> 37:08.330]  Exactly.
[37:08.330 --> 37:12.330]  If the effect we're talking about is what's causing Dr. J's test results,
[37:12.330 --> 37:18.330]  that means that there are Dr. J's edibles out there with several hundred milligrams of THC per dose
[37:18.330 --> 37:24.330]  rather than the single hundred they're advertising, which is just as unprofessional.
[37:24.330 --> 37:25.330]  That's very true.
[37:25.330 --> 37:27.330]  I don't think that's the case with Dr. J's.
[37:27.330 --> 37:30.330]  It is probably the case with some of the others that we're testing.
[37:30.330 --> 37:33.330]  Yeah, I think it's just a point I thought I'd bring up.
[37:33.330 --> 37:34.330]  No, it's a good one.
[37:34.330 --> 37:36.330]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[37:36.330 --> 37:39.330]  Because that is part of the equation in some of them for sure.
[37:39.330 --> 37:44.330]  They are working with white chocolate star bars and winter mint chocolate.
[37:44.330 --> 37:48.330]  Maybe that shit's stirring up and it's getting a little puddle on one side
[37:48.330 --> 37:49.330]  or maybe it's stuck to the wrapper.
[37:49.330 --> 37:51.330]  We got to give them a little bit of –
[37:51.330 --> 37:54.330]  Maybe these idiots are cooking it all off in their ovens.
[37:54.330 --> 37:56.330]  A little too hot or something?
[37:56.330 --> 37:58.330]  Cooking it at 400 degrees for 30 minutes?
[37:58.330 --> 37:59.330]  That's a good point.
[37:59.330 --> 38:00.330]  I'm just saying.
[38:00.330 --> 38:02.330]  Maybe they had a rogue employee rip them off.
[38:02.330 --> 38:03.330]  If they're doing this bad.
[38:03.330 --> 38:06.330]  Maybe Dr. J's company, like the good folks there have no idea.
[38:06.330 --> 38:09.330]  Maybe there's one – it takes one bad apple in your whole company
[38:09.330 --> 38:14.330]  to fucking produce a whole seven units, 7,000 units of fucked up chocolate bars.
[38:14.330 --> 38:18.330]  Knowing the size of Dixie Elixir and Chibichews
[38:18.330 --> 38:21.330]  and some of those other major companies' operations,
[38:21.330 --> 38:26.330]  I can see how their numbers kind of went all over the place
[38:26.330 --> 38:31.330]  these last couple of months because their distribution quadrupled.
[38:31.330 --> 38:36.330]  I mean, they weren't prepared for the demand that's at their companies
[38:36.330 --> 38:37.330]  even a little bit.
[38:37.330 --> 38:38.330]  It was hard to predict.
[38:38.330 --> 38:39.330]  Shit blew up here.
[38:39.330 --> 38:43.330]  Yeah, no one knew what was coming, what the demand would be like.
[38:43.330 --> 38:46.330]  On top of that, none of these people were allowed to produce product
[38:46.330 --> 38:48.330]  for the new recreational market.
[38:48.330 --> 38:52.330]  They had to transfer over up to 15% of their existing inventory,
[38:52.330 --> 38:57.330]  and this caused all sorts of product interruptions and shortages.
[38:57.330 --> 39:02.330]  In an effort to scramble to catch up, how much of these test results are due to that?
[39:02.330 --> 39:04.330]  Just trying to rush it.
[39:04.330 --> 39:05.330]  That's a good point.
[39:05.330 --> 39:07.330]  Just trying to rush it.
[39:07.330 --> 39:10.330]  We saw it coming, but we didn't know it was going to happen like this.
[39:10.330 --> 39:14.330]  When the wreck hit, it was so hyped up, and everybody got anxious and shit.
[39:14.330 --> 39:16.330]  We got pumped up.
[39:16.330 --> 39:18.330]  I want to say another thing.
[39:18.330 --> 39:20.330]  I don't want to scare everybody away.
[39:20.330 --> 39:22.330]  Don't be afraid of dispensaries and edibles.
[39:22.330 --> 39:27.330]  This is one company out of, I'm going to read off more brands,
[39:27.330 --> 39:32.330]  Edipure, lemon drops, hard candies, listed 100%.
[39:32.330 --> 39:33.330]  They tested at 45.
[39:33.330 --> 39:36.330]  Mile-high candies, watermelon drops, listed 100%.
[39:36.330 --> 39:38.330]  They tested at 17.
[39:38.330 --> 39:42.330]  Dixie Elixirs, Dixie Rolls, 100%, listed 60% actual.
[39:42.330 --> 39:44.330]  Here's a good one for us.
[39:44.330 --> 39:47.330]  Blue Kudu Cookies and Cream Chocolate Bar, listed 100%.
[39:47.330 --> 39:49.330]  They came in at 105%.
[39:49.330 --> 39:50.330]  I'll give them props.
[39:50.330 --> 39:55.330]  Just like everything on the shelf, ask the bud tender which one people come back and buy a bunch.
[39:55.330 --> 39:57.330]  For me, there are two.
[39:57.330 --> 40:00.330]  I don't even know if I want to say the company name, but there's two.
[40:00.330 --> 40:02.330]  No, if you've got something you like, you can say it.
[40:02.330 --> 40:03.330]  Chibuchews is awesome.
[40:03.330 --> 40:05.330]  They're going to be on the list, so we'll get to them.
[40:05.330 --> 40:07.330]  Their number on this test was disappointing to me.
[40:07.330 --> 40:11.330]  It hurt to know a company that I've supported vocally didn't score.
[40:11.330 --> 40:14.330]  You should do math on that because it's – I mean, I'm not being smart-ass to your answer.
[40:14.330 --> 40:18.330]  You should do the math though because the recommended dose is smaller than the rest.
[40:18.330 --> 40:19.330]  I'm going to keep reading and we'll get to that.
[40:19.330 --> 40:22.330]  Growing Kitchens Chocolate Chunk Cookie, listed 100%.
[40:22.330 --> 40:23.330]  We talked about that.
[40:23.330 --> 40:24.330]  It came in at 101%.
[40:24.330 --> 40:25.330]  Much love again.
[40:25.330 --> 40:26.330]  Mad respect for that.
[40:26.330 --> 40:31.330]  Incredibles Mile-High Mint Chocolate Bar, listed 100 milligrams.
[40:31.330 --> 40:32.330]  It came in at 146%.
[40:32.330 --> 40:34.330]  That's dangerous, you guys.
[40:34.330 --> 40:36.330]  I know I'm a pothead.
[40:36.330 --> 40:37.330]  You're a pothead.
[40:37.330 --> 40:40.330]  We can handle it, but there are patients out there and people from Texas that haven't had a lot of edibles.
[40:41.330 --> 40:42.330]  People from Texas.
[40:42.330 --> 40:43.330]  That's mean.
[40:43.330 --> 40:46.330]  People buy their own, but they don't like that.
[40:46.330 --> 40:48.330]  They're not ready for what they're going to get hit with.
[40:48.330 --> 40:49.330]  There are people, yeah.
[40:49.330 --> 40:50.330]  I bought an Incredibles.
[40:50.330 --> 40:53.330]  I went to a dispensary looking for Chibichews is actually what I wanted.
[40:53.330 --> 40:55.330]  They didn't have them and they had Incredibles on sale.
[40:55.330 --> 41:00.330]  I bought the Mile-High Mint and I bought a – what's the – it's a monkey bar.
[41:00.330 --> 41:01.330]  I love that fucking monkey bar, bro.
[41:01.330 --> 41:03.330]  I ate them both.
[41:03.330 --> 41:05.330]  I was wrecked.
[41:05.330 --> 41:07.330]  I was really, really high.
[41:07.330 --> 41:09.330]  I'm a professional, bro.
[41:09.330 --> 41:12.330]  They both had to be overdosed because I was.
[41:12.330 --> 41:20.330]  So here's Mike's favorite, Chibichew Quad Dose Soft Candies, which is usually my go-to edible.
[41:20.330 --> 41:22.330]  If I got to go somewhere and eat an edible.
[41:22.330 --> 41:24.330]  They say they have 70 milligrams.
[41:24.330 --> 41:26.330]  They came in at 53.
[41:26.330 --> 41:30.330]  That's not nearly as bad as some of the other companies on there, but still there.
[41:30.330 --> 41:31.330]  What's the percentage?
[41:31.330 --> 41:32.330]  Did you do it?
[41:32.330 --> 41:33.330]  I didn't do it.
[41:33.330 --> 41:35.330]  Oh, Kevin, you're a math whiz.
[41:35.330 --> 41:38.330]  It's 73 divided by 70, right?
[41:39.330 --> 41:40.330]  That's right.
[41:40.330 --> 41:41.330]  Do it.
[41:41.330 --> 41:42.330]  That's right.
[41:42.330 --> 41:44.330]  I don't know.
[41:44.330 --> 41:49.330]  It's still a shortage of – I mean if you're paying for 70, you expect 70.
[41:49.330 --> 41:51.330]  Yeah, it's about 80%.
[41:51.330 --> 41:52.330]  That's – yeah, 80%.
[41:52.330 --> 41:55.330]  They came in better than a lot of other companies.
[41:55.330 --> 41:58.330]  In my experience with them is it's a consistent product.
[41:58.330 --> 41:59.330]  It's a good product.
[41:59.330 --> 42:00.330]  The flavor is decent.
[42:00.330 --> 42:03.330]  I love their red hornet candies or their green hornet candies.
[42:03.330 --> 42:04.330]  Oh, yeah.
[42:04.330 --> 42:05.330]  Yeah.
[42:06.330 --> 42:09.330]  It was sad to see that they weren't right on the money.
[42:09.330 --> 42:10.330]  Joey, go for Diaz.
[42:10.330 --> 42:13.330]  That was the first thing I looked for when I saw that article came out.
[42:13.330 --> 42:16.330]  I scanned for Chibochu's results and went, aw.
[42:16.330 --> 42:17.330]  Go for my favorites.
[42:17.330 --> 42:19.330]  Joey Diaz likes to call them the Chibochu.
[42:19.330 --> 42:20.330]  The Chibochu.
[42:20.330 --> 42:21.330]  I ate a freaking Chibochu.
[42:21.330 --> 42:23.330]  I'm fucking wrecked up.
[42:23.330 --> 42:26.330]  So the last one on our list is Sweetstone Candy Fruit Loops.
[42:26.330 --> 42:27.330]  Big love.
[42:27.330 --> 42:29.330]  It's listed 50, 50 milligrams.
[42:29.330 --> 42:30.330]  It came in at 45.
[42:30.330 --> 42:34.330]  So shout out to Cloud the Candyman and Melissa, the whole Sweetstone team.
[42:34.330 --> 42:36.330]  They're cool freaking people, man.
[42:36.330 --> 42:38.330]  Not just good edible makers.
[42:38.330 --> 42:40.330]  They didn't pay me to say that, but they will.
[42:40.330 --> 42:44.330]  See, they're not a huge operation.
[42:44.330 --> 42:47.330]  They're not doing millions of units out of a warehouse, right?
[42:47.330 --> 42:49.330]  I don't know their business.
[42:49.330 --> 42:50.330]  I can't speak for them.
[42:50.330 --> 42:51.330]  You don't know their business.
[42:51.330 --> 42:57.330]  I know their product is good and that Claude is a cool fucking dude and that Melissa smiles every time you wave her at her and smile.
[42:57.330 --> 42:59.330]  It was my understanding that they were smaller.
[42:59.330 --> 43:01.330]  So shout out to the smaller guys.
[43:01.330 --> 43:08.330]  Every time I see Claude, if you smile at him and say, what's up, bro, and high five him, he will give you a Claude bear to eat.
[43:08.330 --> 43:11.330]  A Claude bear a day keeps the haters away.
[43:11.330 --> 43:12.330]  I don't know.
[43:12.330 --> 43:13.330]  Fucking yeah.
[43:13.330 --> 43:15.330]  That's some tasty shit.
[43:15.330 --> 43:16.330]  Claude bears.
[43:16.330 --> 43:18.330]  You just got a big old promo from me, Claude.
[43:18.330 --> 43:19.330]  Much love, bro.
[43:19.330 --> 43:20.330]  Well, guys, we've gone 45 minutes.
[43:20.330 --> 43:23.330]  You want to wrap up the first episode here and call it a success?
[43:23.330 --> 43:25.330]  I think that sounds pretty nifty.
[43:25.330 --> 43:28.330]  You got anything you want to shout out, give some promos to, Kev?
[43:29.330 --> 43:33.330]  Make sure you check out Iry Genetics, Steve Hill Halent.
[43:35.330 --> 43:38.330]  Check out my buddies at Top Shelf Extracts.
[43:38.330 --> 43:39.330]  There you go.
[43:39.330 --> 43:40.330]  Much love.
[43:41.330 --> 43:46.330]  If you run into any old elevated concentration stuff on the Internet, it might be fun to look at.
[43:46.330 --> 43:47.330]  There you go.
[43:47.330 --> 43:51.330]  And shout out to the whole cannabis community, dude.
[43:51.330 --> 43:53.330]  Cannabis community.
[43:53.330 --> 43:55.330]  Hey, you just got your ticket for the Cannabis Cup, didn't you?
[43:55.330 --> 43:56.330]  I did.
[43:56.330 --> 43:57.330]  Boom.
[43:57.330 --> 43:58.330]  Let's get it done.
[43:58.330 --> 44:00.330]  Did you get a two day or a one day?
[44:00.330 --> 44:01.330]  Two day.
[44:01.330 --> 44:02.330]  We'll be there both days.
[44:02.330 --> 44:04.330]  We're not going together, but we will definitely.
[44:04.330 --> 44:05.330]  You'll see us hanging out together.
[44:05.330 --> 44:07.330]  You'll see us hanging out apart.
[44:07.330 --> 44:08.330]  We'll be doing dabs.
[44:08.330 --> 44:11.330]  We'll be smoking balls, smoking fat joints, saying hi to people.
[44:11.330 --> 44:12.330]  Look for me.
[44:12.330 --> 44:13.330]  We will be cannabis cupping.
[44:13.330 --> 44:16.330]  Mike, you got any cool shit to say for the end of the show?
[44:16.330 --> 44:17.330]  Nope.
[44:17.330 --> 44:18.330]  Nope.
[44:18.330 --> 44:19.330]  Stick to flowers and hash, people.
[44:19.330 --> 44:21.330]  Clearly, edibles don't have it nailed down yet for the most part.
[44:21.330 --> 44:23.330]  That's fucking words from the wise, bro.
[44:23.330 --> 44:25.330]  Hey, I want to thank you guys for joining me on my first show.
[44:25.330 --> 44:26.330]  You guys are my bros.
[44:26.330 --> 44:30.330]  You've been with me since I was fucking growing weed in my mom's basement back in the day.
[44:30.330 --> 44:31.330]  For sure.
[44:31.330 --> 44:32.330]  That means a lot to me.
[44:32.330 --> 44:33.330]  Mike's trimmed a lot of my weed.
[44:33.330 --> 44:36.330]  Kevin's fucking smoked a good portion of that shit.
[44:36.330 --> 44:38.330]  He's been in turn a bunch of it to dabs.
[44:38.330 --> 44:39.330]  It's been good since then.
[44:39.330 --> 44:41.330]  Pheno hunting with me and all that.
[44:41.330 --> 44:42.330]  Thank you guys.
[44:42.330 --> 44:43.330]  Thank you.
[44:43.330 --> 44:45.330]  I want to thank everybody that listened, dude.
[44:45.330 --> 44:46.330]  That was our first episode.
[44:46.330 --> 44:47.330]  I want to call it a success.
[44:47.330 --> 44:48.330]  It was the I Grow Culture podcast.
[44:48.330 --> 44:50.330]  Dude, we have a Twitter.
[44:50.330 --> 44:51.330]  It's at I Grow Culture.
[44:51.330 --> 44:54.330]  If you want to hear about something, growing, smoking, something about Colorado, if you
[44:54.330 --> 44:57.330]  want to say hi, if you want to tell me to fuck off, please do.
[44:57.330 --> 44:59.330]  It's at I Grow Culture.
[44:59.330 --> 45:02.330]  I'm also at Rasta Jeff 420, but that's how it goes.
[45:02.330 --> 45:04.330]  Everybody be good to yourselves.
[45:04.330 --> 45:05.330]  Be good to one another.
[45:05.330 --> 45:07.330]  I'm already fucking slurring and stumbling.
[45:07.330 --> 45:09.330]  Hey, take a fat dab for me.
[45:09.330 --> 45:10.330]  Give your mom a hug.
[45:10.330 --> 45:11.330]  Peace.
[45:11.330 --> 45:38.860]  It's going to be really loud.
[45:38.860 --> 45:39.860]  It's going to be nice.
[45:39.860 --> 45:40.860]  I like it loud.
[45:40.860 --> 45:43.860]  Everyone does.
[45:43.860 --> 45:46.860]  If it's too loud, you're too old.
[45:49.860 --> 46:02.860]  Is he going to come out with his dab song?
[46:02.860 --> 46:03.860]  Oh, a dab song.
[46:03.860 --> 46:04.860]  That'd be a good idea.
[46:04.860 --> 46:05.860]  From the ganja farmer.
[46:05.860 --> 46:07.860]  We've got plenty of dab songs.
[46:07.860 --> 46:09.860]  Task Rock has a dab songs covered.
[46:09.860 --> 46:10.860]  Yeah.
[46:10.860 --> 46:11.860]  Hydro has plenty of dab songs.
[46:11.860 --> 46:12.860]  Yeah, they both have them.
[46:12.860 --> 46:13.860]  I have them on lockdown.
[46:13.860 --> 46:15.860]  Hey, what's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[46:15.860 --> 46:16.860]  Happy hump day podcast world.
[46:17.860 --> 46:19.860]  Welcome to episode number two of the I Grow Culture podcast.
[46:19.860 --> 46:22.860]  This podcast is brought to you by naturesgreenremedies.com.

[46:36.860 --> 46:37.860]  Dude, I'm dabbed the fuck out.
[46:37.860 --> 46:39.860]  I'm over here trying not to cough into the microphone.
[46:39.860 --> 46:42.860]  Nice pre-show dab session over here.
[46:42.860 --> 46:44.860]  We're hanging out on a Wednesday night.
[46:44.860 --> 46:47.860]  We got Kevin's back, Kevin from Elevated Concentrations.
[46:47.860 --> 46:52.860]  In a little bit, we're going to play a phone interview that I did with Addison DeMora from Steep Hill Labs.
[46:52.860 --> 46:53.860]  We'll get into that.
[46:53.860 --> 46:54.860]  What's up, bro?
[46:54.860 --> 46:55.860]  How you doing, Kev?
[46:55.860 --> 46:56.860]  I'm doing pretty good. Yourself?
[46:56.860 --> 46:57.860]  I'm doing IRI, bro.
[46:57.860 --> 46:58.860]  Awesome. Thanks for having me again.
[46:58.860 --> 46:59.860]  I appreciate it.
[46:59.860 --> 47:00.860]  Thanks for coming back.
[47:00.860 --> 47:02.860]  I figured you'd be a good guest to have.
[47:02.860 --> 47:04.860]  The topic tonight is going to be about hash.
[47:04.860 --> 47:05.860]  When we talk about hash.
[47:05.860 --> 47:07.860]  Yeah, that's my favorite topic.
[47:07.860 --> 47:11.860]  Sometimes you sound like you're full of shit, but when it's hash, dude, I believe you.
[47:12.860 --> 47:15.860]  I try to keep up on my hash knowledge and most of my cannabis knowledge.
[47:15.860 --> 47:16.860]  You do well.
[47:16.860 --> 47:19.860]  In our group, we have a nice—we're a cannabis encyclopedia in our group.
[47:19.860 --> 47:20.860]  It's pretty cool.
[47:20.860 --> 47:22.860]  One of us has the answer.
[47:22.860 --> 47:23.860]  Sweet.
[47:23.860 --> 47:27.860]  Well, the reason we're gathered here today, I wanted to talk about the Secret Cup.
[47:27.860 --> 47:30.860]  The Secret Cup was this past weekend in California.
[47:30.860 --> 47:32.860]  I should tell you guys about the Secret Cup.
[47:32.860 --> 47:37.860]  The Secret Cup is a pretty exclusive hash competition.
[47:37.860 --> 47:39.860]  The competition part is invite only.
[47:39.860 --> 47:41.860]  You have to be invited by Big D.
[47:41.860 --> 47:45.860]  Shout out to Big D for hosting a super sweet exclusive hash event.
[47:45.860 --> 47:46.860]  Definitely.
[47:46.860 --> 47:49.860]  We've competed—Kevin and I have competed together.
[47:49.860 --> 47:53.860]  I grew a crop and Kevin extracted it and made pretty tasty dabs out of it.
[47:53.860 --> 47:56.860]  I was satisfied with our results as a first-time competitor.
[47:56.860 --> 47:59.860]  Yeah, me too, especially just a year into it.
[47:59.860 --> 48:01.860]  That was really nice to see where I fit in.
[48:01.860 --> 48:02.860]  We did well.
[48:02.860 --> 48:04.860]  We placed respectfully.
[48:04.860 --> 48:05.860]  Top 10.
[48:05.860 --> 48:06.860]  Respectably or respectfully.
[48:06.860 --> 48:07.860]  Top 10 finish.
[48:07.860 --> 48:08.860]  I think it was both.
[48:08.860 --> 48:09.860]  I'm not sure.
[48:09.860 --> 48:10.860]  We speak V-Hickley's.
[48:10.860 --> 48:11.860]  It's our own language sometimes.
[48:11.860 --> 48:13.860]  We'll fill you in one day if you're lucky.
[48:13.860 --> 48:15.860]  You'll hear it every now and then.
[48:15.860 --> 48:17.860]  Once and again, we'll do it.
[48:17.860 --> 48:22.860]  The Secret Cup, the competition part is invite only.
[48:22.860 --> 48:25.860]  If you want to go hang out, you kind of just got to know how to get tickets.
[48:25.860 --> 48:26.860]  They don't really advertise a lot.
[48:26.860 --> 48:27.860]  You got to know who to know.
[48:27.860 --> 48:30.860]  If you're in the loop, you'll end up at the Secret Cup.
[48:30.860 --> 48:31.860]  Yeah, definitely.
[48:31.860 --> 48:36.860]  The way they do it, every competitor brings his hash to the entry table.
[48:36.860 --> 48:38.860]  They divide it into small samples.
[48:38.860 --> 48:41.860]  Every competitor gets to actually be a judge.
[48:41.860 --> 48:44.860]  They all take dabs of all the stuff that's out there.
[48:44.860 --> 48:48.860]  I find it to be a pretty fair competition because it's judged by the competitors,
[48:48.860 --> 48:50.860]  which keeps it fair.
[48:50.860 --> 48:52.860]  I just repeated myself.
[48:52.860 --> 48:53.860]  Definitely.
[48:53.860 --> 48:58.860]  I mean, who better to judge some hash than a bunch of hash makers and hash connoisseurs?
[48:58.860 --> 49:00.860]  Judged against your peers.
[49:00.860 --> 49:01.860]  Are we going to join again?
[49:01.860 --> 49:03.860]  Are we going to participate again this year, bro?
[49:03.860 --> 49:04.860]  I'm game.
[49:04.860 --> 49:05.860]  I'm ready to do it.
[49:05.860 --> 49:09.860]  If I receive that email, I'll be entering.
[49:09.860 --> 49:14.860]  If you hear this, I read genetics and elevated concentrations want to come participate in the Secret Cup again.
[49:14.860 --> 49:16.860]  Once again, it was a great time last year.
[49:16.860 --> 49:19.860]  I had fun with all the competitors and everything.
[49:19.860 --> 49:21.860]  They're all such great people.
[49:21.860 --> 49:26.860]  It's just fun to put our stuff together and try everybody's dabs.
[49:26.860 --> 49:29.860]  This whole dab community is amazing.
[49:29.860 --> 49:32.860]  We've got musicians that entertain us while we're dabbing.
[49:32.860 --> 49:37.860]  We've got people that come and bring medicated and non-medicated food that are part of the scene.
[49:37.860 --> 49:40.860]  I don't see them at any other events other than cannabis-related,
[49:40.860 --> 49:43.860]  but I see them at every cannabis-related event vending food.
[49:43.860 --> 49:47.860]  We've got people that make pipes for us that are in our groups, like in our industry.
[49:47.860 --> 49:49.860]  We've got people that are making our extracts.
[49:49.860 --> 49:50.860]  We've got clothing.
[49:50.860 --> 49:51.860]  We've got pen companies.
[49:51.860 --> 49:52.860]  We're all friends now.
[49:52.860 --> 49:55.860]  It's kind of a neat little community industry.
[49:55.860 --> 49:57.860]  I guess that's what you call it.
[49:57.860 --> 49:59.860]  It's a family, bro.
[49:59.860 --> 50:04.860]  If you're honest and real and not a dick, you're pretty much accepted and well treated.
[50:04.860 --> 50:09.860]  Even if you are kind of a dick, we'll let you into the crew because every crew needs a couple of dicks.
[50:09.860 --> 50:10.860]  Yeah.
[50:10.860 --> 50:11.860]  That sounds really gross.
[50:11.860 --> 50:15.860]  There are dicks out there, but they know what they're talking about when it comes down to serious shit.
[50:15.860 --> 50:17.860]  So you have to respect them.
[50:17.860 --> 50:18.860]  This is a weird segue.
[50:18.860 --> 50:25.860]  Speaking of dicks, a lot of people are frustrated and hating on Steep Hill Halent Labs.
[50:25.860 --> 50:28.860]  But I find what they did to be legit.
[50:28.860 --> 50:33.860]  Every sample that runs through the Secret Cup is tested through a lab.
[50:33.860 --> 50:39.860]  They used Steep Hill Halent Labs, which is—I know the representatives, Grimey Gatsby.
[50:39.860 --> 50:40.860]  That's Jon Hunt.
[50:40.860 --> 50:42.860]  I also know Addison DeMora, Earl Ripper.
[50:42.860 --> 50:43.860]  Check him out.
[50:43.860 --> 50:44.860]  Also, I'm friends with Joe.
[50:44.860 --> 50:48.860]  He's one of the—I don't know your official position, brother.
[50:48.860 --> 50:49.860]  I'm sorry, but you're a good bro.
[50:49.860 --> 50:50.860]  I know that.
[50:50.860 --> 50:52.860]  Those guys are cool guys from the Steep Hill Halent.
[50:52.860 --> 50:54.860]  They tested every sample that went through there.
[50:55.860 --> 50:58.860]  And they found some pretty interesting results.
[50:58.860 --> 51:06.860]  Almost every single sample that was entered into the Secret Cup was—it would not have passed California standards
[51:06.860 --> 51:10.860]  or Colorado standards for what they call clean and safe BHO.
[51:10.860 --> 51:14.860]  It all contained a chemical called pentane.
[51:14.860 --> 51:18.860]  It's actually a gas called pentane, which is part of butane.
[51:18.860 --> 51:21.860]  So are you ready to play the clip, bro?
[51:21.860 --> 51:22.860]  Yeah.
[51:22.860 --> 51:23.860]  We've got a clip from Addison DeMora.
[51:23.860 --> 51:25.860]  I guess are you ready to listen is what I should have asked.
[51:25.860 --> 51:28.860]  We're going to—yeah, we're just going to play the little clip with Addison.
[51:28.860 --> 51:29.860]  Let me pull it up here.
[51:29.860 --> 51:32.860]  And Kevin and I are going to turn off the microphones and take a couple of dabs,
[51:32.860 --> 51:35.860]  and we'll listen with you because Kevin hasn't heard it yet.
[51:35.860 --> 51:36.860]  So here it goes.
[51:36.860 --> 51:42.860]  This is my interview with Addison DeMora from Steep Hill Halent Laboratories.
[51:42.860 --> 51:43.860]  This is Addison.
[51:43.860 --> 51:44.860]  Hey, Addison.
[51:44.860 --> 51:45.860]  It's Rasta Jeff with iRegenetics.
[51:45.860 --> 51:47.860]  I'm calling you from the iGrow Culture podcast.
[51:47.860 --> 51:48.860]  How are you doing, buddy?
[51:48.860 --> 51:49.860]  Good, brother.
[51:49.860 --> 51:50.860]  How are you doing?
[51:50.860 --> 51:51.860]  I'm doing excellent.
[51:51.860 --> 51:56.860]  I'm trying to learn how to record you from the phone and myself at the same time without blowing something up.
[51:56.860 --> 52:00.260]  You're the best, but, like, I hope you don't die.
[52:00.260 --> 52:01.260]  Hey, thanks, bro.
[52:01.260 --> 52:03.260]  I think I got it figured out.
[52:03.260 --> 52:04.260]  How are you doing, bro?
[52:04.260 --> 52:05.260]  I'm doing great.
[52:05.260 --> 52:09.850]  I was sitting in a meeting with Swerve and Adam.
[52:09.850 --> 52:10.850]  Oh, man.
[52:10.850 --> 52:14.960]  Just talking to them today.
[52:14.960 --> 52:16.960]  Well, make sure you tell those dudes I said hello.
[52:16.960 --> 52:17.960]  Swerve's a good bro of mine.
[52:17.960 --> 52:18.960]  And you mean Adam Dunn?
[52:18.960 --> 52:20.960]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[52:20.960 --> 52:21.960]  Beautiful.
[52:21.960 --> 52:23.960]  Is Adam Dunn the Adam you're hanging out with?
[52:23.960 --> 52:25.960]  Yeah, Adam's with me.
[52:25.960 --> 52:27.960]  He's actually in the other room.
[52:27.960 --> 52:29.960]  I just went to the conference room here.
[52:29.960 --> 52:30.960]  Awesome.
[52:30.960 --> 52:33.960]  Well, make sure you tell both of those guys that Rasta Jeff from iRegenetics says hello.
[52:33.960 --> 52:34.960]  Definitely.
[52:34.960 --> 52:35.960]  I'll send your love.
[52:35.960 --> 52:36.960]  Cool, bro.
[52:36.960 --> 52:37.960]  Thanks a lot.
[52:37.960 --> 52:39.960]  Hey, what's your official title over there at Steep Hill Halen?
[52:39.960 --> 52:40.960]  That's a good place to start.
[52:40.960 --> 52:47.960]  I am the co-founder as well as the chief operations officer for the company.
[52:47.960 --> 52:48.960]  Awesome.
[52:48.960 --> 52:49.960]  That's a good title, bro.
[52:49.960 --> 52:51.960]  Excuse my voice here.
[52:51.960 --> 52:52.960]  It's 420 in Colorado.
[52:52.960 --> 52:54.960]  I was just participating in 420.
[52:54.960 --> 52:56.960]  Oh, no, I feel you.
[52:56.960 --> 52:57.960]  All good.
[52:57.960 --> 52:58.960]  It's 420 all the time.
[52:58.960 --> 53:00.960]  All the time, especially when you got Swerve and Adam Dunn in the house.
[53:00.960 --> 53:02.960]  I bet you guys are having a good time over there.
[53:02.960 --> 53:03.960]  I saw.
[53:03.960 --> 53:06.740]  Nice.
[53:06.740 --> 53:10.740]  So, bro, the main reason I wanted to get you on my show, this is the second episode of my podcast.
[53:10.740 --> 53:12.740]  I really wanted to get you on.
[53:12.740 --> 53:14.740]  You're a big member of our community.
[53:14.740 --> 53:23.740]  My topic was the Secret Cup happened last weekend, and Steep Hill Halen had the honor of testing every sample that was entered into the cup.
[53:24.740 --> 53:31.740]  And from what I've read, you guys have discovered pentane or other contaminants in nearly every sample that was entered.
[53:31.740 --> 53:38.740]  I'm hoping that maybe you can educate myself and my listeners about what you guys do and what you discovered.
[53:38.740 --> 53:42.140]  Explain what had happened.
[53:42.140 --> 53:51.830]  Essentially, we've been doing treatment.
[53:51.830 --> 53:58.740]  One of the problems we ran into is that the method that we had developed was non-quality.
[53:58.740 --> 54:01.740]  Essentially, what it did was it gave a pass or fail.
[54:01.740 --> 54:02.740]  It didn't give.
[54:02.740 --> 54:27.660]  And we looked at it and said, you know what?
[54:27.660 --> 55:18.680]  We want to move in the direction of doing it quantitative because we don't want—we should direction of lowering the range that we're looking at down to about 1-100.
[55:18.680 --> 55:21.680]  Can you tell me what some of the other things may be?
[55:21.680 --> 55:22.680]  What was that?
[55:22.680 --> 55:26.680]  Can you tell me what some of the other contaminants may be that you're looking for?
[55:26.680 --> 55:28.680]  They're solvents.
[55:28.680 --> 55:29.680]  Okay.
[55:29.680 --> 55:49.530]  That's all that we're trying to use either.
[55:49.530 --> 55:50.530]  Very smart move.
[55:51.530 --> 56:20.000]  We published—so we don't get into that list.
[56:20.000 --> 56:46.670]  But anyway, we had gone ahead and—
[56:46.670 --> 56:47.670]  So we said, you know what?
[56:47.670 --> 56:48.670]  That's what we want to do.
[56:48.670 --> 56:57.310]  We worked on it and figured that that was a method we were going to use in Colorado and in Washington as well.
[56:57.310 --> 56:58.310]  So they had some requirements.
[56:58.310 --> 57:16.370]  And we built out what we felt was the best new trace residual solvent.
[57:16.370 --> 57:51.450]  Some of the reasons why we added the pentane—
[57:52.450 --> 58:10.920]  But we—because we added pentane, when we ran the tests for—because we hadn't run anything for that, and we hadn't really—before we did our homework beforehand, we didn't see anybody that was testing for pentane.
[58:10.920 --> 58:11.920]  Yeah, you're the first.
[58:11.920 --> 58:12.920]  No pentane.
[58:12.920 --> 58:13.920]  No pentane, for that matter.
[58:13.920 --> 58:16.920]  We added it because we knew it would be there.
[58:16.920 --> 58:20.190]  Or we were curious.
[58:20.190 --> 58:23.190]  So we unveiled it for about a month before the cup.
[58:23.190 --> 58:31.000]  We saw them at that point thinking about putting together some information because we're seeing something new.
[58:31.000 --> 58:33.000]  And then we ran the cup.
[58:33.000 --> 58:59.890]  And I think there may be—and of course, too, trying to protect terpenes.
[58:59.890 --> 59:00.890]  Absolutely.
[59:00.890 --> 59:27.240]  So what it does is it ups the ante now in the tech, where guys are going to have to, A, be using a closed-loop system that way.
[59:27.240 --> 59:29.240]  So we get to relearn making hash again.
[59:29.240 --> 59:31.240]  Yeah, so—what's that?
[59:31.240 --> 59:34.240]  So we get to basically relearn how to make hash all over again.
[59:34.240 --> 59:43.840]  When that happens, you raise the bar a bit.
[59:43.840 --> 59:44.840]  Absolutely.
[59:44.840 --> 01:00:02.620]  People have to change their process.
[01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:10.280]  We're not saying you need to come to us and get to know people who choose to use other labs, but you need to go to your lab and get consulted.
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:24.840]  Right.
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:26.840]  That worked really well for you guys.
[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:28.840]  And got the conversation going because that's—
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:43.660]  Supports you and droolable leakage.
[01:00:43.660 --> 01:01:00.000]  When you look at this and you look at it, but it definitely did cause a stir.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  Well, I think that's the best way to do stuff is to cause a stir in this community.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  That's my explanation.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  I really appreciate that.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  That was great.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  But what do you find pentane to be dangerous and how dangerous do you think it is?
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  We don't—you know, the reason we went after pentane—
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:53.890]  Absolutely.
[01:01:53.890 --> 01:02:05.800]  So I don't have a bunch of it in me.
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.800]  Right. It ends in tane. You don't want to—
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:08.800]  It's a gas.
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:13.140]  Gas in me. That's kind of how I feel about it.
[01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:14.140]  I agree with you completely.
[01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:35.800]  You know, it's very—I think it's a four—I think it's a four-carbon.
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:36.800]  That's all right.
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:13.960]  Well, I'm a heavy dabber and I hang out with a lot of heavy dabbers.
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:16.960]  And I'm a member of the community and we all appreciate what Steep Hill's doing,
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:17.960]  keeping us safe.
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:19.960]  And you guys are revolutionizing medicine.
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:21.960]  You guys are keeping us all safe and healthy.
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:22.960]  And I appreciate it.
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:46.330]  There you go.
[01:04:46.330 --> 01:04:47.330]  And get to it, you know?
[01:04:47.330 --> 01:04:51.330]  I'd rather some feelings get hurt than some patience.
[01:04:51.330 --> 01:04:52.330]  To the valley.
[01:04:52.330 --> 01:05:02.130]  Haters are going to hate, bro.
[01:05:02.130 --> 01:05:08.940]  At the same time, it seems like it's where growth comes from.
[01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:09.940]  You know, uncomfortableness.
[01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:10.940]  That's right.
[01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:16.280]  It's where—you know, I think in a year we're going to look back on this and have it in now,
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:19.960]  won't have it in then.
[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:20.960]  Things will be better.
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:24.960]  Everyone will be happy and apologies accepted.
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:27.960]  Well, speaking of growth, what's in the future for Steep Hill Halent?
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:48.020]  It's nice.
[01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:49.020]  And that lab is beautiful.
[01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:50.020]  What's that?
[01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:51.020]  Oh, that lab is beautiful.
[01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:52.020]  I've been in that lab.
[01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:53.020]  You guys gave me a quick tour.
[01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:54.020]  And that place was really neat.
[01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:55.020]  Joe's an amazing guy also.
[01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:56.020]  Oh, thank you.
[01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:57.020]  I assume so.
[01:05:57.020 --> 01:06:42.110]  Steep Hill worldwide.
[01:06:42.110 --> 01:06:43.110]  Yeah, quite a bit going on.
[01:06:43.110 --> 01:06:44.110]  Quite a bit.
[01:06:44.110 --> 01:06:45.110]  I'm proud of you guys.
[01:06:45.110 --> 01:06:46.110]  I'm proud of you guys.
[01:06:46.110 --> 01:06:47.110]  And I appreciate it.
[01:06:47.110 --> 01:06:50.110]  So, what's in the future for Addison DeMora?
[01:06:50.110 --> 01:06:52.110]  What do you want to do for yourself?
[01:06:52.110 --> 01:06:59.260]  Aren't you always on vacation, bro?
[01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:00.260]  I'm running out of time.
[01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:01.260]  I mean, you saw me in Colorado.
[01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:02.260]  That's what's next.
[01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:31.030]  You needed most for me.
[01:07:31.030 --> 01:07:33.030]  Go spend some time with those beautiful kids of yours.
[01:07:34.030 --> 01:07:38.130]  I think my last one was in the Sun Other One.
[01:07:38.130 --> 01:07:39.130]  It's due.
[01:07:39.130 --> 01:07:40.130]  It is due.
[01:07:40.130 --> 01:07:43.130]  Well, what kind of mark do you want to leave on our community, my friend?
[01:07:43.130 --> 01:07:45.130]  What's that?
[01:07:45.130 --> 01:07:46.130]  What kind of mark?
[01:07:46.130 --> 01:07:50.130]  When the world is coming to an end and we're reading history books, and they say,
[01:07:50.130 --> 01:07:53.130]  That Addison DeMora, what kind of mark do you want to leave on this world?
[01:07:53.130 --> 01:07:55.130]  What do you want people to say about you when you're gone?
[01:07:55.130 --> 01:08:34.440]  You do yourself.
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:35.440]  That's a very respectable answer, my friend.
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:36.440]  I appreciate that.
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:41.440]  Hey, do you have any plugs you want to give, shout outs or anything, before we say goodbye to each other?
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:09:03.080]  Awesome.
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:06.080]  Hey, bro, I really appreciate you being my first phone interview on my show.
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:08.080]  It was kind of awkward for me, but I'm getting used to it now.
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:12.080]  It was really good having a friend do it for me, so I really appreciate that.
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:14.080]  Dude, if you have anything you want to add, you've got my phone number.
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:15.080]  Feel free to call me anytime.
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:17.080]  Keep in touch with me on Facebook.
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:18.080]  Dude, I love you guys.
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:19.080]  I love what you're doing.
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:21.080]  Give everybody out there a hug and a high five for me.
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:23.080]  Hey, man, go spend some time with your kids.
[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:24.080]  You deserve it.
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:26.080]  Thank you, man.
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:27.080]  And you guys, too.
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:36.640]  Check us out for sure.
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:37.640]  Awesome, brother.
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:38.640]  Hey, I really appreciate you.
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:39.640]  I'm slow, bro.
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:42.640]  I really appreciate you, and I hope we talk again soon.
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:47.880]  Most definitely, and Earl Ripper.
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:48.880]  Earl Ripper.
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:49.880]  Also check out atgrindme.com.
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:50.880]  Earl Ripper.
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:53.530]  Thanks so much.
[01:09:53.530 --> 01:09:54.530]  I appreciate it.
[01:09:54.530 --> 01:09:55.530]  Take care of yourself, brother.
[01:09:55.530 --> 01:09:56.530]  Peace and love.
[01:09:56.530 --> 01:09:57.530]  Yep, keep it, Irie.
[01:09:57.530 --> 01:10:02.240]  Irie, so bye.
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:05.240]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, that was my first phone interview ever.
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:07.240]  It was with Mr. Addison DeMauro from Steep Hill.
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:10.240]  He had a lot of education to give us there.
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:13.240]  I feel like I just got a hash education for free.
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:14.240]  Yeah, that was pretty cool.
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:18.240]  Actually, it was neat to hear some of the things he said,
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:23.240]  especially towards the end about a lot of the specifics on the testing that
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:27.240]  they're doing, because I didn't really know much about that end of it.
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:33.240]  A lot of the beginning stuff, I was pretty much privy to,
[01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:37.240]  I guess you could say, and just kind of holding it in myself.
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:40.240]  So it's neat to kind of have some of the things I've been thinking about
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:45.240]  and some of my concerns also validated through somebody who's so respected in
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:48.240]  the industry, me being a beginner.
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:49.240]  Doesn't that always feel good?
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:50.240]  Yeah, it's neat.
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:51.240]  It's just different.
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:53.240]  You're accidentally doing shit right.
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:56.240]  Yeah, like accidentally, exactly.
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:58.240]  All right, so once again, a big, huge thank you to Addison DeMauro.
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:10:59.240]  Thanks, Addy.
[01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:00.240]  We love you for that, buddy.
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:01.240]  Check out at Earl Ripper.
[01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:02.240]  I'm not sure how he spells it.
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:07.240]  We'll find out before the end of the show that he's got some cool pictures.
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:08.240]  Get your stuff tested by Steep Hill.
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:10.240]  I always trust everything that they tell me.
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:11.240]  They've got a good, clean lab.
[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:12.240]  I've been there.
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:14.240]  They don't pay me to say that I like it.
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:16.240]  That's the only reason I talk about them.
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:18.240]  And also to the Secret Cup.
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.240]  Where did I come from with that Southern thing?
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:21.240]  That Secret Cup, people.
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:24.240]  Damn, all those dabs got me, bro.
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:26.240]  We were taking dabs while you guys were listening.
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:31.240]  To all the Secret Cup competitors whose concentrates were tested,
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:32.240]  we're not calling you out.
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:34.240]  We're not trying to diss you or anything.
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:35.240]  This was the example that we had.
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:37.240]  This is where the results came from.
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:41.240]  I know that you guys will get together and fix your tech,
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:43.240]  and you guys will figure out how to do this.
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:45.240]  Yeah, and we'll see where everyone else is at, too.
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:48.240]  Because like Addison said,
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:52.240]  that's the first time they've done that test for the Secret Cup.
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:12:00.240]  So, we'll see when we go to the other regions what the rest of our hash tests at.
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:06.240]  And if it's similar, or if it's somewhere way different, or who does what.
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:13.240]  He did also mention that even though butane is the highest concentration,
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:16.240]  most highly concentrated, damn, that was hard to find.
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:20.240]  Butane is the most highly concentrated residual solvent left in dabs that they're finding.
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:23.240]  And he said that that is not even at a dangerous level,
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:27.240]  if you consider other applications that we're using butane for.
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:30.240]  So, we don't need to quit dabbing just because of a little pentane scare.
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:32.240]  This is just the new thing.
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:33.240]  We figured out mystery oil.
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:35.240]  We've learned how to get rid of mystery oil.
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:37.240]  We're a smart bunch.
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:38.240]  We're going to get this together.
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:41.240]  Yeah, the more we work with it, and the more we develop,
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:44.240]  and the more we learn about it, the better we can make everything.
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:49.240]  And we can make things that, you know, just like we already keep stepping it up as a community.
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:54.240]  Keep making things better and better and easier and more safe and all that.
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:56.240]  So, you know, that's what it takes.
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:13:01.240]  It takes a community, and we all pitch in a little bit.
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:05.240]  Every time you bring me back a batch of hash, it's a little bit better.
[01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:06.240]  Every single time.
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:07.240]  Well, thank you. I appreciate it.
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:08.240]  Every single time.
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:10.240]  I learn from every batch of hash.
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:12.240]  I learn something from every single batch.
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:14.240]  If you pay attention to it, you will.
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:16.240]  I mean, it's just a natural thing.
[01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:18.240]  I'll share a website with you.
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:19.240]  I've got to scroll down to find it.
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:24.240]  But once I get to this website, it's where a few of our highly respected hash community members,
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:27.240]  it's where they find and share their information.
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:28.240]  So, it'll be useful to everybody.
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:30.240]  Get a pen to write that down.
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:34.240]  You've got to also remember to give you the correct at Earl Ripper Instagram.
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:38.240]  Just scroll through Instagram and look for at E-R-R-L Ripper.
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:39.240]  It's close to that. You'll find him.
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:41.240]  There's a picture of this dude named Addison.
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:44.240]  He looks like that Mexican drug cartel that just got busted.
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:45.240]  I thought that was really funny.
[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:46.240]  Yeah, he kind of does.
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:48.240]  He kind of does look like that guy.
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:51.240]  So, one cool thing that I heard in there that caught my attention,
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:56.240]  they don't reveal the solvents they're testing for, which is kind of neat.
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:58.240]  I thought that was interesting, and I kind of liked that.
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:08.240]  I think it's much less biased, and I think it just makes it really fair for everyone.
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:12.240]  Just try to make the best hash you can make, and we'll test it and find out.
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:13.240]  There you go.
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:17.240]  And then we'll share information to let you know what's going on after we're done testing.
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:18.240]  That's kind of nice.
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:22.240]  And now we know to get rid of that, too. That kind of helps.
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:23.240]  Exactly.
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:24.240]  So, we learned.
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:27.240]  I gave you a big thumbs down in the middle of that while he was talking.
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:32.240]  Terps, terpenes, terpenoids, they're terpenoids.
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:37.240]  If you don't know the whole word, you've got to read the definition of terpenoids and read what those are.
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:41.240]  Once you know what terpenoids are, then you can say terps.
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:45.240]  And I'm going to do that to trichomes also.
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:51.240]  If you say trichromes or trichomes, it's T-R-I-C-H-O-M-E-S.
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:52.240]  It's a trichome.
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:53.240]  There's no chrome.
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:54.240]  We're not polishing it.
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:57.240]  I just want to help you people be educated.
[01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:00.240]  I'm not trying to be an asshole even though I feel like one suddenly.
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:05.240]  But these terpenoids I'm speaking of boil at the same temperatures as pentane.
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:09.240]  So, when you're trying to purge off your pentane, you're fucking destroying your terpenoids.
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:14.240]  And the terps are one of my second favorite parts of the hash for me.
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:21.240]  And that was an interesting part for me because when he started mentioning using the closed loop and the cold trap
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:29.240]  and how it's getting us to these safe levels and things we can do to further advance our concentrates,
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:33.240]  it's something I've been talking about with a close group of friends of mine
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:37.240]  that we should have been at this point when we first started.
[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:39.240]  We just didn't know that.
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:45.240]  And I think we should have been using closed loop systems and cold traps and all that when concentrates first.
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:52.240]  When I first learned how to make decent concentrates, I was like, dude, we should have been doing this way differently for a long time now.
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:57.240]  The money that you invested and the material that I invested could have been better used towards.
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:58.240]  But we didn't know that.
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:15:59.240]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:00.240]  Not for a fact.
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:01.240]  This thing's always evolving.
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:02.240]  Yeah.
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:06.240]  And man, I can't complain about any of the hash you've made in the past.
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:09.240]  I mean, I really like it, but there's definitely.
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:10.240]  Two years or so?
[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:12.240]  How long have you been killing it?
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:14.240]  About a year.
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:18.240]  Remember the time we went to Springs and hung out in our friend's place?
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:19.240]  Yeah.
[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:20.240]  Since then, you've been crushing it.
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:23.240]  You learned things from Denver and Springs that impressed me.
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:24.240]  Yeah.
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:25.240]  So you know how to compensate.
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:31.240]  And are you going to, do you know, do you have an idea how to figure out how to remove the pentane?
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:35.240]  You got to go to, I took a couple of notes from another spot.
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:39.240]  I think it's 106 degrees is where pentane starts to boil off.
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:43.240]  And that's also where the terpenoids burn off.
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:46.240]  So how are you going to, do you have an idea of how to compensate for all that stuff?
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:49.240]  That's what he was talking about with that cold trap.
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:52.240]  You're going to be able to suck those gases out.
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:55.240]  And the cold traps, there's like three chambers and they have different filters in them.
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:57.240]  So they all trap different things.
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:01.240]  And one of them traps terpenoids.
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:05.240]  And so you just reintroduce that back into the hash afterwards.
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:10.240]  So you can, you trap your terpenes that you lose and you reintroduce it back into the hash.
[01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:17.240]  The pentane is not the same molecule structure or the same size as the terpenoids.
[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:22.240]  But it does boil off at a similar temperature.
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:25.240]  Okay. I understand what you're saying. I catch you.
[01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:29.240]  It's a filtration system and a cold trap system.
[01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:35.240]  So between the, you put the cold trap between the vacuum pump and your vacuum oven or chamber.
[01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:36.240]  Wow.
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:43.240]  And so as you're vacuuming that gas through, it traps stuff and it lets stuff through.
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:45.240]  That sounds fucking brilliant.
[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:47.240]  I'm glad I'm the breeder and the grower.
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:49.240]  They're expensive.
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:52.240]  And I don't have to do the, that sounds too sciencey for me.
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:53.240]  But they're awesome.
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:58.240]  And I would ruin that I feel. I feel so comfortable with the plants and breeding and growing and helping people grow.
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:02.240]  I hear it and see, I don't. I feel very comfortable with all of this sciencey stuff.
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:04.240]  Tima, that's a good team there.
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:05.240]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:08.240]  For sure. So find us at the Secret Cup this year in Denver.
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:12.240]  We'll be roaming around together. I'm tall. I'm a white guy with dreadlocks.
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:15.240]  I'm short. I'm a white guy without dreadlocks.
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:20.240]  That makes us easy to find. We're wearing hoodies and grassroots hats.
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:22.240]  You know, we don't blend in at all.
[01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:27.240]  We'll have ivory genetic shirts or elevated concentration shirts or a mixture of the two.
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:29.240]  I'll be high. I'll have red eyes.
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:31.240]  So I look forward to it. I look forward to it.
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:35.240]  The Cannabis Cup is coming up, but I'm just going. I'm not promoting it.
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:38.240]  I don't have a booth or anything. I've got a bunch of friends with booths.
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:41.240]  I have a great time at the Cannabis Cup every year, so I'm just fun.
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:42.240]  Yeah, we're going to have a good time.
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:43.240]  I love it.
[01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:44.240]  We're going to have a good time.
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:49.240]  So I read a post from a well-respected member of the hash community on Facebook.
[01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:54.240]  No, let me, on Facebook I read a post. He's well-respected everywhere, not just on Facebook.
[01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:55.240]  I want to be clear about that shit.
[01:18:55.240 --> 01:19:00.240]  This guy throws this Secret Cup. He throws the dabs of Denver.
[01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:06.240]  He did the dabs of Denver event and gave all of the proceeds to a care center.
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:12.240]  I don't know the official word of care center so that they could buy themselves a van to get their residents to and from their doctor's appointments.
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:14.240]  And this dude puts his heart and soul into what he does.
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:18.240]  And bro, you got my mad love. The guy I'm talking about is Big D.
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:24.240]  He posted on Facebook, and I'm kind of paraphrasing and chopping it into pieces here so that it makes a good show.
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:36.240]  But it says, a rat in a lab can handle 6,800 ppm of pentane with every single breath it takes for 120 hours straight and have no discernible effects.
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:41.240]  He also advised to make sure that before you eat BHO, you decarboxylize it.
[01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:50.240]  And that will make sure you get rid of most residual carbons, gases, things you don't want.
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:54.240]  He also says, excuse me, dabs are clogging me up.
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:20:06.240]  He says if you choose to inhale BHO, please make sure that you heat your dab up to 600 degrees at least until it vaporizes and then filter it through water.
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:10.240]  And by through water, he doesn't mean filter it. He means use a bong, a water pipe, a bubbler.
[01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:14.240]  Yeah. Don't do the dry hit dabs.
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:19.240]  And while we're at it, don't use shitty Chinese import glass made by some fucking little kid without protective gear.
[01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:20.240]  Yeah, please.
[01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:24.240]  By American made. If you know a glass blower, try to support them.
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:25.240]  Indeed.
[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:26.240]  Indeed.
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:27.240]  Especially if they're good.
[01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:29.240]  Yeah, they'll get better. If you give them work, they will get better.
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:36.240]  And then you'll have something from the beginning and then when they're fucking killing it, when they're in the glass galleries next to our heroes.
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:40.240]  I bet the people that have a coil piece from back in the day are ultra proud.
[01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:43.240]  What if your next glass blower friend becomes coil condenser?
[01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:44.240]  Man.
[01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:45.240]  Man.
[01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:56.240]  We're all using the e-nail and I don't think a lot of us are heating it to 600 degrees because there's that low temp dab sensation that's been going on.
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:59.240]  The craze with the e-nails and carb caps.
[01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:00.240]  Yes.
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:05.240]  Is that going to be a thing of the past or are we too stubborn to even adjust?
[01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:15.240]  Well, that's going to change with technique and as people develop their technique to get rid of this pentane thing.
[01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:20.240]  Because it's just like they said, it evaporates at a similar temperature as the terpenes.
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:30.240]  So if you're doing a low temp dab, well it tastes better because you're conserving more of the terps.
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:37.240]  And if you do a higher temp dab, you're getting rid of more of the gas like he's saying but it doesn't taste as good.
[01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:41.240]  So that would only, you know, that makes sense.
[01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:45.240]  Most of the people that dab with me know that I kind of knock the low temp dab thing.
[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:46.240]  That's not my style.
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:49.240]  I like those big kick you in the dick kind of dabs, dude.
[01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:53.240]  When you're not sure if you're going to have a stroke or if you're coming or if you're in the middle.
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:56.240]  Kind of feels like you're drowning and disco dancing at the same time.
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:57.240]  I love those dabs.
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:03.240]  I mean once we start getting rid of a lot of these gases again and developing our technique to be even better,
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:11.240]  we're going to be able to do those low temp dabs and not inhale, however, thousands of ppm of pentane.
[01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:17.240]  Big up to Steve Hill for helping me not further harm my lungs with useless garbage.
[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:18.240]  Yes, indeed.
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:20.240]  So a couple episodes.
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:21.240]  Where am I? This is number two.
[01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:23.240]  It had to be the last episode, I'm pretty sure.
[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:25.240]  I bet in episode number one.
[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:26.240]  I bet.
[01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:33.240]  So I bet that in episode number one you said something about dewaxing.
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:35.240]  You mentioned dewaxing.
[01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:36.240]  I sure did.
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:39.240]  You are going to become my hash expert on my little podcast here.
[01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:40.240]  I hope you're aware of that.
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:41.240]  Whatever.
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:43.240]  I'll do what I can.
[01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:47.240]  Can you define and then describe the methods?
[01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:48.240]  I'll do my best.
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:49.240]  Yeah, let's keep in mind.
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:50.240]  Here's my disclaimer for you.
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:51.240]  Kev's not a scientist.
[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:53.240]  He did not go to science school.
[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:54.240]  Don't try this shit at home.
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:55.240]  We're not responsible.
[01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:56.240]  Be a fucking adult.
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:57.240]  Read a book.
[01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:58.240]  Go to school.
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:22:59.240]  Read a book.
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:00.240]  Read a book.
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:01.240]  Read a motherfucking book.
[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:02.240]  I did read some books.
[01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:04.240]  So don't sue us.
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:08.240]  And Kev's a hash maker, not a scientist or a professor or something.
[01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:09.240]  Yeah.
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:18.240]  Well, dewaxing, from my knowledge, is when as you're making the concentrate in the process,
[01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:29.240]  you use cold temperatures to separate plant fats and lipids and waxes from the oils.
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:37.240]  Because your cannabinoids and your terpenoids are pretty much all oil form.
[01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:43.240]  So slightly different polarities with each of the molecules, what have you.
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:49.240]  But the cold actually separates the wax to the bottom.
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:54.240]  It allows you to, after time, you know, you let it sit for a little while.
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:24:00.240]  The layers separate and then you can pour the oil through a filter just in case any of the wax is loose.
[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:02.240]  You can filter it out with lab filter paper.
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:06.240]  So at one point, you're basically, you've got your dabs where they're liquid.
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:07.240]  I've seen it at that point.
[01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:08.240]  It's slushy.
[01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:11.240]  And now you're pouring it into something and it's settling?
[01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:12.240]  Essentially, you have.
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:13.240]  Okay.
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:15.240]  And the chunky part is what we don't want to smoke.
[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:16.240]  That's plant paraffins.
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:17.240]  And what else is it?
[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:19.240]  Lipids, waxes.
[01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:23.240]  And those are like the cellular structure of the plant, right?
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:24.240]  Yes.
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:26.240]  And very carcinogenic.
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:27.240]  Very harmful.
[01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:29.240]  I want to do an experiment with you and this is off topic.
[01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:35.240]  I want to see if we run silicates, potassium silicates in a plant, if it makes a difference on the amount of wax you take out.
[01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:36.240]  Somebody do that.
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:41.240]  If anybody has a grow room and you can do that, if you have a hash guy that is doing this,
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:49.240]  I'd like to see are potassium silicates affecting our wax and de-waxing processes and fucking up our hash.
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:50.240]  So keep going, dude.
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:51.240]  I'm sorry to interrupt.
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:52.240]  I just want to make the picture clear.
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:53.240]  You've got like this big container.
[01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:59.240]  In my mind, you've got a big container of goopy, butane, hash mixture and the chunky parts sink into the bottom.
[01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:00.240]  Yeah.
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:01.240]  Okay.
[01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:02.240]  It looks like it's the opposite of beer.
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:03.240]  The head's on the bottom.
[01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:04.240]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:05.240]  It looks like beer up top.
[01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:06.240]  It's nasty.
[01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:07.240]  Okay.
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:20.240]  Essentially, that goes through a filtration and they make essentially closed sealed de-waxing chambers with regulators and all that.
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:22.240]  It's essentially the same process.
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:26.240]  It still needs to be in a cold bath to get the separation, all of that.
[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:34.240]  You transfer that oil into the hot water bath or hot water container chamber.
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:36.240]  It depends on the system.
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:38.240]  Everything's going to closed loop now.
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:41.240]  It's all technically the same.
[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:43.240]  You still do it the same way.
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:49.240]  It's just all in a closed system now, which makes it much easier, safer, higher quality, definitely.
[01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:50.240]  Okay.
[01:25:51.240 --> 01:26:08.240]  That just removes all that harmful plant matter from the concentrates because a lot of what causes the congestion and the harshness when you smoke flour is a lot of that is a carcinogenic plant matter.
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:10.240]  I've also read that it makes people puke.
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:13.240]  It makes you nauseous if you inhale too much.
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:14.240]  It definitely can.
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:16.240]  It can give you headaches, make you really lightheaded.
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:18.240]  That's no fun.
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:20.240]  No, and we don't want that in our medicine.
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:21.240]  Counterproductive.
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:22.240]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:23.240]  All right.
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:26.240]  Now you've run it through a filtration.
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:29.240]  You pour that shit through a funnel and it filters out.
[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:32.240]  Then it goes to the vac purge essentially?
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:33.240]  Yeah.
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:34.240]  Okay.
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:36.240]  I think most of the hash makers understand that.
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:40.240]  If you don't understand, that's cool because you're going to have to do research.
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:42.240]  We may leave shit out so that you have to read it around.
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:47.240]  We don't want to guide you into fucking yourself or any of my friends or any of your patients up.
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:56.240]  Yeah, you use screen mesh, things like that to filter whatever size of whatever you're trying to get at.
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:01.240]  Do different strains require different size screen meshes like when you're making bubble?
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:03.240]  From what I've noticed, yes.
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:13.240]  Different strains have different trichome sizes and that will affect your yield in extraction if you don't use different filter sizes.
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:14.240]  Makes complete sense.
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:17.240]  It will affect your purity levels too.
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:25.240]  If you have smaller trichomes and you're using a bigger filter, you're going to get a lot more of that nasty wax stuff in there.
[01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:28.240]  That waste solvent lets shit through.
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:32.240]  Good description, bro.
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:33.240]  One more question I have about that.
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:35.240]  How does that affect your yield?
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:36.240]  Is it worth?
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:42.240]  I haven't seen it affect my yield in enough of a negative way to change what I'm doing at all.
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:46.240]  Since you started doing it for me, the hash hasn't come back light or anything.
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:47.240]  It's been acceptable.
[01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:48.240]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:49.240]  Yeah.
[01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:50.240]  Sweet.
[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:53.240]  When you don't take out the waxes, I've noticed you get the heavy lungs.
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:58.240]  I dab with other people and I know who is de-waxing and who's not usually after a couple of fat dabs.
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:00.240]  I've started to notice that too.
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:07.240]  A lot of times you can also tell because if you don't de-wax, it'll leave residual particles on your nail.
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:11.240]  Is that why I've got to replace and or scrape my nail every once in a while?
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:14.240]  I know I shouldn't scrape it, but I can't fucking replace it every day.
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:18.240]  When you dab like we do over here, you go through nails.
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:20.240]  Hey, Task, it's time for some new nails, buddy.
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:23.240]  I need the Duality 1418, please.
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:25.240]  Maybe a couple of fluxes.
[01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:26.240]  I know you can tell me to go flux myself.
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:27.240]  I'm just trying, buddy.
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:28.240]  Shout out to Task Rock, dude.
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:30.240]  That guy hooks me up with plenty of good titanium.
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:33.240]  Keeps me dabbing.
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:36.240]  I need to get one of those Trinity nails soon for my new rig that's coming.
[01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:37.240]  There you go.
[01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:39.240]  Give that guy a shout out.
[01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:40.240]  That glass bottle?
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:42.240]  I don't know his freaking last name.
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:43.240]  I don't know his company name.
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:45.240]  Find out what he wants to be called and I'll have you back.
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:46.240]  Kevin will be back.
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:47.240]  He'll give this glass bottle a shout out.
[01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:49.240]  I'll figure out all the information because he's a badass.
[01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:50.240]  He's got a pretty cool new rig going on.
[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:52.240]  He does good.
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:55.240]  You're ready to go to the closed loop and cold packs, aren't you?
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:56.240]  Yeah, dude.
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:57.240]  I really am.
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:28:58.240]  I'd like to see that happen for you.
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:03.240]  As soon as I can grab one up, I'm getting it.
[01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:05.240]  As soon as I can grab one up.
[01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:07.240]  They're pricey and I haven't been able to save them.
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:08.240]  They don't grow on trees.
[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:10.240]  Yeah, they don't grow on trees.
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:12.240]  I just recently became employed.
[01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:18.240]  It's going to be a second unless my job wants to start hooking it up on concentrate equipment.
[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:21.240]  We can get something going there.
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:23.240]  That's up to them.
[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:25.240]  On the air begging never helps, never hurts.
[01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:26.240]  Yeah, dude.
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:28.240]  I like to do what I do.
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:34.240]  The more I can step up my game and the more I can advance my process, technique, equipment,
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:36.240]  the more I want to do so.
[01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:39.240]  Oh, I kind of hinted that I was going to share a website.
[01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:41.240]  I've got to look up real quick.
[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:42.240]  I want to scroll through this.
[01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:43.240]  I've saved a couple of.
[01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:44.240]  Yeah, you did.
[01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:46.240]  I know and I don't want to lie to our friends because we've got loyal listeners.
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:48.240]  It's two episodes and they've paid attention this far.
[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:50.240]  Skunkfarmresearch.com.
[01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:51.240]  There you go.
[01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:53.240]  Skunkfarm with a ph.
[01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:54.240]  Research.com.
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:55.240]  Skunkfarmresearch.com.
[01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:57.240]  Shout out to Big D.
[01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:03.240]  He's the one that told me, that posted on Facebook, that that was a good site to look for hash information.
[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:06.240]  I need to correct myself.
[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:07.240]  Lower temps.
[01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:09.240]  The boiling point of pentane is 97 degrees.
[01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:10.240]  I said 96.
[01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:11.240]  I just want to correct myself.
[01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:12.240]  I think you said 106.
[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:13.240]  Yeah, I did.
[01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:14.240]  See, I'm fucking lying twice.
[01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:15.240]  It's 97.
[01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:16.240]  I just want to be accurate.
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:17.240]  Yeah.
[01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:20.240]  So, yeah, I just wanted to correct some things.
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:22.240]  Now, I'm going to introduce a new part of the show.
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:23.240]  I'm going to create a segment here.
[01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:25.240]  It's called Give Thanks.
[01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:31.240]  It's a segment where I want to give thanks to somebody who has contributed heavily to the cannabis world
[01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:33.240]  and deserves some thanks.
[01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:37.240]  So, this episode, we're going to give thanks to Mr. Mark Emery.
[01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:38.240]  Yeah.
[01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:39.240]  Yeah.
[01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:42.240]  If you don't know who Mark Emery is, he's in a bunch of movies.
[01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:46.240]  He's in, what's it called, Super Jaime with Doug Benson.
[01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:49.240]  He's the guy that talks forever.
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:50.240]  Forever.
[01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:52.240]  Doug looks like he took a nap while he was there.
[01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:54.240]  He smokes like a six-foot bong.
[01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:58.240]  It's probably five feet, four or five feet, maybe six, and just talks his ass off.
[01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:00.240]  He's got those droopy.
[01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:03.240]  He looks like, was it Droopy the Dog?
[01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:04.240]  Remember, Dopey?
[01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:05.240]  Droopy the Dog.
[01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:06.240]  Going down, sir.
[01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:07.240]  He looks like that.
[01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:10.240]  He's got the droopy eyes because of all the fucking weed he smoked.
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:14.240]  He's a Canadian guy, but we won't hold that against him.
[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:15.240]  Mark Emery.
[01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:16.240]  I'm going to read a little bit about him.
[01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:24.240]  Mark Emery is a Canadian cannabis reform policy advocate who is currently serving five years in American federal prison for selling cannabis seeds.
[01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:26.240]  Keep in mind, I said American federal prison.
[01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:28.240]  That's going to come into play later.
[01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:34.240]  Mark shipped seeds from Canada to the United States, and he was charged with conspiracy to manufacture marijuana.
[01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:37.240]  Mark was the publisher of Culture.
[01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:38.240]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:39.240]  I'm stuttering here.
[01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:45.240]  Mark was the publisher of Cannabis Culture Magazine and once ran for the mayor of the city of Vancouver.
[01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:46.240]  This dude's not a criminal.
[01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:48.240]  I call Mark a soldier.
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:49.240]  I know that's cheesy as shit, right?
[01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:50.240]  Thank you.
[01:31:50.240 --> 01:32:04.240]  Mark started Mark Emery direct marijuana seeds in 1995, which he ran until it was raided by Vancouver police acting on a request of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration.
[01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:07.240]  I want to say that again more clearly without stuttering.
[01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:15.240]  This dude was raided by the Vancouver police acting on the request of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration.
[01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:19.240]  So America called Canada and was like, this guy is pissing us off.
[01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:20.240]  It's illegal.
[01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:23.240]  You fuck with him and they did it, dude.
[01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:27.240]  That's kind of bullshit.
[01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:28.240]  He wasn't even there.
[01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:35.240]  How do you he's in another country and America is just overstepping their boundaries in my opinion and going and pulling this dude.
[01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:44.240]  If you went to James High Elementary School and Kevin Elementary School, some shit went down.
[01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:46.240]  James High School isn't going to come get you.
[01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:48.240]  The schools aren't going to trade your ass.
[01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:54.240]  It's fucking where you do your crime is where you do your crime where you did your time and there was no crime in my opinion.
[01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:55.240]  So it's all bullshit.
[01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:58.240]  All right, I'm going to read.
[01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:00.240]  Keeps me focused.
[01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:11.240]  Mark Emery was taken into custody on September 28th of 2009 and held at the North Frazier pretrial center in BC to await.
[01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:15.240]  Sorry, I cut and pasted this and I missed something, but I'll keep going to wait.
[01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:18.240]  He was held there to await extradition to the USA.
[01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:26.240]  And on May the 10th of 2010, Justice Minister Rob Nicholson signed the order and ordered Emery to surrender to authorities, which he did the same day.
[01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:29.240]  Bullshit.
[01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:39.240]  On May 10th, 2010, Justice Minister Nicholson ruled Emery be extradited to the United States where Mark faced five years in the US penal system.
[01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:49.240]  The possibility existed that Emery may be allowed to serve all or part of his sentence in Canada, but US authorities rejected this option.
[01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:52.240]  Rejected. Nope, you got to come to America.
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:54.240]  So Emery was extradited to the United States.
[01:33:54.240 --> 01:34:01.240]  On May 24th, he appeared in a Seattle courtroom and pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to manufacture marijuana.
[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:07.240]  And he had to plead guilty because, I mean, imagine the fucking court pressure, all the lawyers, all the bullshit up against him.
[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:09.240]  Take all your money.
[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:12.240]  And that's part of what this they think this was about.
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:13.240]  Politics.
[01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:16.240]  Mark was heavily involved in politics and stuff.
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:26.240]  And they think, Mark's people think that they were trying to take all of his money because he made a lot of money selling seeds and they were trying to take his money and get him out of politics.
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:31.240]  So on September 10th, 2010, in a Seattle courtroom, Mark Emery was sentenced to five years in prison.
[01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:41.240]  US District Court Judge Ricardo Martinez sentenced Emery, stating there was no question his actions were criminal and that Emery ensured others broke the law by selling them seeds.
[01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:45.890]  There's so many things that go through my head right now.
[01:34:45.890 --> 01:34:46.890]  Cannabis seeds.
[01:34:46.890 --> 01:34:48.890]  They're little bits to preserve.
[01:34:48.890 --> 01:34:49.890]  They're souvenirs.
[01:34:49.890 --> 01:34:50.890]  They're preservation.
[01:34:50.890 --> 01:34:52.890]  They're gifts.
[01:34:52.890 --> 01:34:57.890]  I mean, probably 30 percent of those were ever actually grown.
[01:34:57.890 --> 01:35:00.890]  And I'm sure he made people promise they wouldn't germinate them.
[01:35:00.890 --> 01:35:04.890]  That's what you do on a what's what they do on a seed site, apparently, allegedly.
[01:35:05.890 --> 01:35:07.890]  All right.
[01:35:07.890 --> 01:35:15.890]  So the court noted that Emery claimed on his website to have made some three million dollars a year from selling seeds from his Vancouver headquarters.
[01:35:15.890 --> 01:35:17.890]  I hate to call you out, Mark.
[01:35:17.890 --> 01:35:18.890]  That was a fucking mistake.
[01:35:18.890 --> 01:35:21.890]  Don't ever say you made three million dollars selling seeds.
[01:35:21.890 --> 01:35:24.890]  Don't ever fucking talk about how much money you made.
[01:35:24.890 --> 01:35:27.890]  That's my personal advice in the air.
[01:35:27.890 --> 01:35:33.890]  So Emery donated almost all of the money generated from his seed sales to marijuana policy reform efforts.
[01:35:33.890 --> 01:35:36.890]  You just redeemed your fuck ups for bragging about your money in my mind.
[01:35:36.890 --> 01:35:42.890]  So Emery's claims that all that his or Emery claims that his arrest was political.
[01:35:42.890 --> 01:35:45.890]  This was these claims were disputed by the prosecution.
[01:35:45.890 --> 01:35:47.890]  Sorry, I'm dabbed out and trying to read.
[01:35:47.890 --> 01:35:50.890]  So on November 19th, 2010, Mark Emery was transferred to the D.
[01:35:50.890 --> 01:35:57.890]  Ray James Correctional Facility in Folkston, Georgia, is since then been transferred to a federal correctional institution.
[01:35:57.890 --> 01:36:02.890]  It's called the Yazoo City Law to serve the rest of his sentence.
[01:36:02.890 --> 01:36:06.890]  Mark Emery is a victim of the drug war and we owe him a cannabis medal of honor.
[01:36:06.890 --> 01:36:09.890]  So we salute you and we give you thanks, Mark Emery.
[01:36:09.890 --> 01:36:12.890]  Seriously, from the bottom of our hearts, from the whole cannabis world, Mark Emery, thank you.
[01:36:12.890 --> 01:36:14.890]  We're sorry you're in prison.
[01:36:14.890 --> 01:36:19.890]  We wish we could all split that up amongst us and serve an hour or a day or whatever we had to do.
[01:36:19.890 --> 01:36:21.890]  Just to take a little bit of that.
[01:36:21.890 --> 01:36:23.890]  He's got a wife.
[01:36:23.890 --> 01:36:24.890]  She needs him at home.
[01:36:24.890 --> 01:36:25.890]  He needs to be at home.
[01:36:25.890 --> 01:36:26.890]  It's in federal prison.
[01:36:26.890 --> 01:36:28.890]  I've seen some of the shit they make him do there, too.
[01:36:28.890 --> 01:36:30.890]  So dude, seriously, much love and respect for Mark Emery.
[01:36:30.890 --> 01:36:34.890]  In the prison that he's in, they make him tuck the beds down like military style.
[01:36:34.890 --> 01:36:36.890]  And they give you a checklist of what you're allowed.
[01:36:36.890 --> 01:36:41.890]  And you get so many, like one toothbrush, three ounces of toothpaste.
[01:36:41.890 --> 01:36:42.890]  This shit's ridiculous, dude.
[01:36:42.890 --> 01:36:44.890]  Nobody should have to live like that.
[01:36:44.890 --> 01:36:45.890]  Feel sorry for the poor dude.
[01:36:45.890 --> 01:36:47.890]  Feel sorry for everybody in prison.
[01:36:47.890 --> 01:36:52.890]  Maybe now that we've changed some marijuana laws here, we'll start releasing all the people that are locked up for cannabis crimes.
[01:36:52.890 --> 01:36:54.890]  Maybe we can get some of this fixed.
[01:36:54.890 --> 01:36:59.890]  You know, there was a case that, and it was kind of a ridiculous try, but they got one lady's cannabis case overthrown.
[01:36:59.890 --> 01:37:04.890]  But there were also other ridiculous charges in that case.
[01:37:04.890 --> 01:37:06.890]  So she's still incarcerated on those charges.
[01:37:06.890 --> 01:37:07.890]  Oh, man.
[01:37:07.890 --> 01:37:09.890]  But the cannabis is erased from the chart.
[01:37:09.890 --> 01:37:10.890]  There's no...
[01:37:10.890 --> 01:37:11.890]  Okay.
[01:37:11.890 --> 01:37:12.890]  But, I mean, it's still kind of...
[01:37:12.890 --> 01:37:14.890]  So in court, that shit counts.
[01:37:14.890 --> 01:37:17.890]  That sets precedent and stands forever.
[01:37:17.890 --> 01:37:19.890]  Damn, I think we had a good podcast, bro.
[01:37:19.890 --> 01:37:20.890]  It feels like it's a good time to stop.
[01:37:20.890 --> 01:37:21.890]  Do you got any plugs?
[01:37:21.890 --> 01:37:24.890]  Anybody you want to say what's up to?
[01:37:24.890 --> 01:37:25.890]  I don't know, man.
[01:37:25.890 --> 01:37:28.890]  I guess just thanks for having me on again.
[01:37:28.890 --> 01:37:30.890]  Oh, dude, thanks for coming to be in my hash guy.
[01:37:30.890 --> 01:37:33.890]  I mean, Irie Genetics is always killing it on the seed breeding.
[01:37:33.890 --> 01:37:34.890]  Thank you.
[01:37:34.890 --> 01:37:36.890]  So are many of the other guys here in Colorado.
[01:37:36.890 --> 01:37:39.890]  We got some good breeders coming out of the woodworks here.
[01:37:39.890 --> 01:37:44.890]  And they're going to start setting some new standards on some new stuff.
[01:37:44.890 --> 01:37:50.890]  So that's exciting to see, especially coming from the end process, the concentrate end.
[01:37:50.890 --> 01:37:55.890]  It's nice to see some new tastiness coming out and some very oily stuff.
[01:37:56.890 --> 01:37:58.890]  So I'm excited for all that.
[01:37:58.890 --> 01:38:05.890]  And I look forward to competing with all the extract artists in the secret cup coming up in August.
[01:38:05.890 --> 01:38:08.890]  I'll see everybody at the Cannabis Cup.
[01:38:08.890 --> 01:38:10.890]  And let's do some dabs.
[01:38:10.890 --> 01:38:13.890]  Don't be surprised if you see some collaborations in breeding companies.
[01:38:13.890 --> 01:38:14.890]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:38:14.890 --> 01:38:15.890]  Come from the Cannabis Cup.
[01:38:15.890 --> 01:38:18.890]  There are talks of some trades and some meetings.
[01:38:18.890 --> 01:38:20.890]  And some things may go on.
[01:38:20.890 --> 01:38:21.890]  That's exciting stuff, man.
[01:38:21.890 --> 01:38:28.890]  And thanks again to Addison and to Maura for all the good knowledge and always making this community step up.
[01:38:28.890 --> 01:38:30.890]  It's really awesome to Steep Hill and all those guys.
[01:38:30.890 --> 01:38:32.890]  Steep Hill, Haylett, the whole crew.
[01:38:32.890 --> 01:38:33.890]  Big D, thanks Big D.
[01:38:33.890 --> 01:38:35.890]  I quoted a lot of your Facebook posts.
[01:38:35.890 --> 01:38:37.890]  I appreciate you posting.
[01:38:37.890 --> 01:38:39.890]  As always, the whole community.
[01:38:39.890 --> 01:38:43.890]  Just for killing it and moving up and coming together.
[01:38:43.890 --> 01:38:44.890]  There you go.
[01:38:44.890 --> 01:38:45.890]  Moving up and coming together.
[01:38:45.890 --> 01:38:46.890]  It's what it's all about, guys.
[01:38:46.890 --> 01:38:48.890]  Quit being a—well, I'm not accusing anybody.
[01:38:48.890 --> 01:38:50.890]  Don't be selfish and stingy with your information.
[01:38:50.890 --> 01:38:53.890]  Try to share and help each other learn.
[01:38:53.890 --> 01:38:56.890]  And if you see somebody doing something wrong, don't try to call them out on their bullshit.
[01:38:56.890 --> 01:38:57.890]  Gently correct them.
[01:38:57.890 --> 01:38:58.890]  Let's help each other.
[01:38:58.890 --> 01:39:00.890]  I know some people don't want to fucking learn.
[01:39:00.890 --> 01:39:01.890]  I get it.
[01:39:01.890 --> 01:39:02.890]  Totally get it.
[01:39:02.890 --> 01:39:04.890]  I try to help people sometimes and they just don't want to hear your shit.
[01:39:04.890 --> 01:39:06.890]  But the people that want to learn, help them learn.
[01:39:06.890 --> 01:39:08.890]  Don't try to shoot them down because it's the only way we're going to get anywhere.
[01:39:08.890 --> 01:39:09.890]  Hey, thanks for listening.
[01:39:09.890 --> 01:39:10.890]  It was episode number two.
[01:39:10.890 --> 01:39:12.890]  I promise I got more great episodes coming.
[01:39:12.890 --> 01:39:14.890]  Check out naturesgreenremedies.com.
[01:39:14.890 --> 01:39:16.890]  Check out iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[01:39:17.890 --> 01:39:18.890]  Check me out.
[01:39:18.890 --> 01:39:20.890]  I'm at rostedjeff420 on Twitter.
[01:39:20.890 --> 01:39:24.890]  We are at iGrowCulture on Twitter.
[01:39:24.890 --> 01:39:25.890]  I just made a Twitter.
[01:39:25.890 --> 01:39:31.890]  And look at iRegenetics on Instagram for some ridiculous cannabis photography.
[01:39:31.890 --> 01:39:34.890]  I'm saving a whole bunch of—I had a photo shoot the other day that was very well done.
[01:39:34.890 --> 01:39:36.890]  I'm not going to take photo credits.
[01:39:36.890 --> 01:39:37.890]  The plants are all mine.
[01:39:37.890 --> 01:39:39.890]  But the photos were from another friend.
[01:39:39.890 --> 01:39:41.890]  We'll bring them on the show and let him talk about it.
[01:39:41.890 --> 01:39:44.890]  But you guys are going to see some great new photography coming up from me pretty soon.
[01:39:45.890 --> 01:39:46.890]  All right.
[01:39:46.890 --> 01:39:48.890]  So I'm going to select an outro song here.
[01:39:48.890 --> 01:39:50.890]  And we'll catch you guys next time.
[01:39:50.890 --> 01:39:51.890]  Peace and love.
[01:39:51.890 --> 01:39:52.890]  Take a fat dab.
[01:39:52.890 --> 01:39:53.890]  Give your mom a hug for me.
[01:40:46.610 --> 01:40:47.610]  Ha!
[01:40:47.610 --> 01:40:48.610]  Advertise that, yeah.
[01:41:02.650 --> 01:41:03.650]  Advertise that, yeah.
[01:41:03.650 --> 01:41:04.650]  Advertise that.
[01:41:04.650 --> 01:41:05.650]  Advertise that.
[01:41:05.650 --> 01:41:06.650]  Advertise that.
[01:41:06.650 --> 01:41:07.650]  Advertise that.
[01:41:07.650 --> 01:41:08.650]  Advertise that.
[01:41:08.650 --> 01:41:09.650]  Advertise that.
[01:41:09.650 --> 01:41:10.650]  Advertise that.
[01:41:16.650 --> 01:41:17.650]  Advertise that.
[01:41:17.650 --> 01:41:19.650]  Let it be positive all the time.
[01:41:19.650 --> 01:41:22.650]  If you feel a way about the herb,
[01:41:22.650 --> 01:41:24.650]  remember that that's creation divine.
[01:41:24.650 --> 01:41:27.650]  If you feel a way about the herb,
[01:41:27.650 --> 01:41:29.650]  let it be positive all the time.
[01:41:29.650 --> 01:41:32.650]  If you feel a way about the herb,
[01:41:32.650 --> 01:41:35.650]  homegrown weed is the best weed to find now.
[01:41:35.650 --> 01:41:38.650]  Check the benefits when you're using it.
[01:41:38.650 --> 01:41:39.650]  It's so deep, deep.
[01:41:39.650 --> 01:41:40.650]  What's up, Podcast World?
[01:41:40.650 --> 01:41:44.650]  Welcome to episode number three of the iGrow Culture Podcast.
[01:41:44.650 --> 01:41:46.650]  It's warm today in here.
[01:41:46.650 --> 01:41:48.650]  Yeah, it was warm at work too.
[01:41:48.650 --> 01:41:49.650]  Man, it's kind of nice.
[01:41:49.650 --> 01:41:51.650]  I think I like it because it's been cold,
[01:41:51.650 --> 01:41:53.650]  so I think I like it, but it's just different.
[01:41:53.650 --> 01:41:54.650]  Before we get started,

[01:42:12.650 --> 01:42:15.650]  I've been playing some pretty cool intro and outro music.
[01:42:15.650 --> 01:42:16.650]  That's some of my favorite stuff.
[01:42:16.650 --> 01:42:19.650]  I've got to give credit to that before we go any further.
[01:42:19.650 --> 01:42:23.650]  Episode number one, my intro song was TASK, Rock, TASK & Linus.
[01:42:23.650 --> 01:42:24.650]  Big shout-out to TASK.
[01:42:24.650 --> 01:42:25.650]  I respect you so much, bro.
[01:42:25.650 --> 01:42:27.650]  Thanks for all the stuff you do.
[01:42:27.650 --> 01:42:28.650]  Anyway, the song was D-Day.
[01:42:28.650 --> 01:42:32.650]  The outro song on episode one was Mystic Roots with DJ In A Dance.
[01:42:32.650 --> 01:42:35.650]  Shout-out Coot and Catherine and the Mystic Roots crew.
[01:42:35.650 --> 01:42:38.650]  Friends of mine, great music.
[01:42:38.650 --> 01:42:41.650]  Episode number two, I opened with Marlon Asher, Ganja Farmer,
[01:42:41.650 --> 01:42:44.650]  because they call me the Ganja Farmer.
[01:42:44.650 --> 01:42:45.650]  Why wouldn't I play that song?
[01:42:45.650 --> 01:42:46.650]  What the hell?
[01:42:46.650 --> 01:42:50.650]  Episode number two, the outro song was Anthony B., Herb People.
[01:42:50.650 --> 01:42:52.650]  Love some dancehall reggae.
[01:42:52.650 --> 01:42:56.650]  You just heard Nayora with Positive Herb.
[01:42:56.650 --> 01:43:01.650]  I've got a cool outro song coming up that I will give credit on the next episode.
[01:43:01.650 --> 01:43:04.650]  Got to stay proper and give credit to the people that help us out.
[01:43:04.650 --> 01:43:06.650]  I've got to give a big shout-out to my buddy Wade Ridley.
[01:43:06.650 --> 01:43:09.650]  He made me a really stylish logo for the podcast,
[01:43:09.650 --> 01:43:12.650]  that microphone with the bud growing out of it there.
[01:43:12.650 --> 01:43:13.650]  Yeah, that stuff's looking good.
[01:43:13.650 --> 01:43:15.650]  That's Wade Ridley's designs. He's getting good at that.
[01:43:15.650 --> 01:43:17.650]  Thanks, brother. I appreciate it.
[01:43:17.650 --> 01:43:18.650]  Well done, sir.
[01:43:18.650 --> 01:43:23.650]  Another big, big, ridiculous shout-out to my buddy Tony.
[01:43:23.650 --> 01:43:25.650]  Without Tony, this wouldn't even happen.
[01:43:25.650 --> 01:43:29.650]  Tony does my web stuff, and you're a boss at that shit, bro.
[01:43:29.650 --> 01:43:30.650]  You really helped me.
[01:43:30.650 --> 01:43:33.650]  Got a feed going, got me up on iTunes really quickly.
[01:43:33.650 --> 01:43:35.650]  You're a pro, bro. Thank you.
[01:43:35.650 --> 01:43:37.650]  He makes my website look good, iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[01:43:37.650 --> 01:43:39.650]  Take a look there.
[01:43:39.650 --> 01:43:42.650]  And then, most importantly, thanks to the people that are following us.
[01:43:42.650 --> 01:43:44.650]  You've gotten three episodes in.
[01:43:44.650 --> 01:43:47.650]  You must like something. I must be doing something right.
[01:43:47.650 --> 01:43:48.650]  And I do appreciate you for following.
[01:43:48.650 --> 01:43:51.650]  Thanks for hitting the subscribe button. That makes us feel good.
[01:43:51.650 --> 01:43:58.650]  I want to give a huge thanks again to Addison DeMora for his in-depth description of the testing.
[01:43:58.650 --> 01:43:59.650]  I'm still talking about that, dude.
[01:43:59.650 --> 01:44:00.650]  That was awesome to me.
[01:44:00.650 --> 01:44:01.650]  I'm still learning from that.
[01:44:01.650 --> 01:44:03.650]  I've gone back and played it multiple times just to,
[01:44:03.650 --> 01:44:05.650]  what the fuck did he say in that part?
[01:44:05.650 --> 01:44:08.650]  I'm going to try to take a note in my head to try to remember that.
[01:44:08.650 --> 01:44:09.650]  So, big shout-out, Addison.
[01:44:09.650 --> 01:44:12.650]  He did give us a check out episode two if you missed it.
[01:44:12.650 --> 01:44:18.650]  Gave us a nice long description and education on testing of cannabis and edibles.
[01:44:18.650 --> 01:44:21.650]  So, yeah, shout-out to everyone that's gotten this far with us.
[01:44:21.650 --> 01:44:22.650]  We appreciate the support.
[01:44:22.650 --> 01:44:24.650]  Now, we're hanging out again.
[01:44:24.650 --> 01:44:27.650]  We got Kevin from Elevated Concentrations to my front.
[01:44:27.650 --> 01:44:28.650]  What's up?
[01:44:28.650 --> 01:44:29.650]  Over to my left, we got MilkyTricombs.
[01:44:29.650 --> 01:44:30.650]  What's up, everybody?
[01:44:30.650 --> 01:44:31.650]  That's White Mike.
[01:44:31.650 --> 01:44:33.650]  White Mike.
[01:44:33.650 --> 01:44:37.650]  Hey, I just learned that Colorado Springs has an MMED facility.
[01:44:37.650 --> 01:44:40.650]  So, if you're trying to get badged in Colorado, definitely.
[01:44:40.650 --> 01:44:44.650]  That'll slow down the overflow because Denver was getting crowded.
[01:44:44.650 --> 01:44:47.650]  Yeah, somebody at work was talking about that a couple days ago.
[01:44:47.650 --> 01:44:49.650]  So, that is really cool.
[01:44:49.650 --> 01:44:50.650]  Yeah, I learned something.
[01:44:50.650 --> 01:44:55.650]  If you try to open a Sweet Stone candy, the package with your teeth.
[01:44:55.650 --> 01:44:56.650]  Get scissors.
[01:44:56.650 --> 01:44:57.650]  Get some scissors.
[01:44:57.650 --> 01:45:01.650]  I screwed up my jaw the other day with that one in your freaking car.
[01:45:01.650 --> 01:45:02.650]  In my car.
[01:45:02.650 --> 01:45:03.650]  After the comedy show.
[01:45:03.650 --> 01:45:04.650]  Yeah.
[01:45:04.650 --> 01:45:05.650]  Trying to get it open.
[01:45:05.650 --> 01:45:06.650]  The next day, my jaw was so sore.
[01:45:06.650 --> 01:45:08.650]  Those things are super childproof.
[01:45:08.650 --> 01:45:11.650]  If your child can get scissors, they can get into that.
[01:45:11.650 --> 01:45:13.650]  But you shouldn't have your child get into the scissors either.
[01:45:13.650 --> 01:45:16.650]  Yeah, I just tried to jack up my teeth trying to open it up.
[01:45:16.650 --> 01:45:18.650]  So, I'm going to eat this while we're live eating.
[01:45:18.650 --> 01:45:19.650]  We're not live.
[01:45:19.650 --> 01:45:20.650]  We're live here, but the show's not live.
[01:45:20.650 --> 01:45:22.650]  While we are on the show, I'm going to eat a...
[01:45:22.650 --> 01:45:23.650]  We're alive, yeah.
[01:45:23.650 --> 01:45:24.650]  We're mostly live.
[01:45:24.650 --> 01:45:27.650]  We're going to get a little dab session here.
[01:45:27.650 --> 01:45:28.650]  Shh.
[01:45:28.650 --> 01:45:30.650]  Don't talk about that guy.
[01:45:30.650 --> 01:45:32.650]  If you're going to do it, do it closer to the microphone.
[01:45:32.650 --> 01:45:33.650]  Just a little bit.
[01:45:33.650 --> 01:45:34.650]  White Mike microphone.
[01:45:34.650 --> 01:45:35.650]  Oh, God.
[01:45:35.650 --> 01:45:36.650]  It's the empty mic.
[01:45:36.650 --> 01:45:37.650]  It's April Fool's Day.
[01:45:37.650 --> 01:45:38.650]  We did not kill anybody.
[01:45:38.650 --> 01:45:39.650]  I'm eating a...
[01:45:39.650 --> 01:45:40.650]  Would you ruin it?
[01:45:40.650 --> 01:45:43.650]  I'm eating a sweet stone candy, cotton candy, gemstone.
[01:45:43.650 --> 01:45:45.650]  I'm going to throw up my mouth.
[01:45:45.650 --> 01:45:46.650]  Whoops.
[01:45:46.650 --> 01:45:48.650]  It looks like I'm opening a condom, to tell you the truth.
[01:45:48.650 --> 01:45:49.650]  I opened one of these at a...
[01:45:49.650 --> 01:45:50.650]  You're still trying.
[01:45:50.650 --> 01:45:51.650]  I know.
[01:45:51.650 --> 01:45:55.650]  I opened one at a comedy show, and I'm pretty sure that at least one or two people had to
[01:45:55.650 --> 01:45:56.650]  think for...
[01:45:56.650 --> 01:45:59.650]  Until I reached in and pulled out a candy, they had to think I was busting open a condom.
[01:45:59.650 --> 01:46:01.650]  Dude, I'm pretty sure you're right.
[01:46:01.650 --> 01:46:02.650]  It's the exact same size.
[01:46:03.650 --> 01:46:04.650]  It looks just like one.
[01:46:04.650 --> 01:46:06.650]  So I've done nothing but talk shit.
[01:46:06.650 --> 01:46:08.650]  I said the wrapper fucked up my teeth and looks like a condom.
[01:46:08.650 --> 01:46:10.650]  I just put this candy in my mouth.
[01:46:10.650 --> 01:46:12.650]  All of the shit talking is done.
[01:46:12.650 --> 01:46:13.650]  This is delicious.
[01:46:13.650 --> 01:46:14.650]  I haven't had the cotton candy flavor.
[01:46:14.650 --> 01:46:15.650]  Is the cotton candy good?
[01:46:15.650 --> 01:46:17.650]  That Dr. P was freaking awesome.
[01:46:17.650 --> 01:46:18.650]  Dude, I could smell the...
[01:46:18.650 --> 01:46:19.650]  I was...
[01:46:19.650 --> 01:46:20.650]  Jesus.
[01:46:20.650 --> 01:46:23.650]  We were in the car, and he busted open Dr. P, and I was like, what the...
[01:46:23.650 --> 01:46:27.650]  I was eating some chips, and I was like, these chips have some weird chemical that are making
[01:46:27.650 --> 01:46:30.650]  me crave Dr. Pepper so badly right now.
[01:46:30.650 --> 01:46:34.650]  He started giggling, and he's like, it could be by Dr. P Sweetstone.
[01:46:35.650 --> 01:46:36.650]  Possibly.
[01:46:36.650 --> 01:46:37.650]  This thing's tasty.
[01:46:37.650 --> 01:46:38.650]  Shout out to Claude.
[01:46:38.650 --> 01:46:40.650]  You guys don't pay me to say shout out to you.
[01:46:40.650 --> 01:46:43.650]  You just make great edibles, and so that gets me to say good work.
[01:46:43.650 --> 01:46:44.650]  You're super nice people.
[01:46:44.650 --> 01:46:46.650]  We're so lucky here.
[01:46:46.650 --> 01:46:48.650]  Hope to see you guys at the Cannabis Cup.
[01:46:48.650 --> 01:46:49.650]  I'm sure we will.
[01:46:49.650 --> 01:46:51.650]  Well, let's get down to business.
[01:46:51.650 --> 01:46:54.650]  Hey, somebody was responsible for keeping a pipe loaded.
[01:46:54.650 --> 01:46:55.650]  I don't know who I delegated this job to.
[01:46:55.650 --> 01:46:56.650]  I didn't know it was not loaded.
[01:46:56.650 --> 01:46:57.650]  It is in front of...
[01:46:57.650 --> 01:46:59.650]  The weed is in front of me, so I will take that responsibility.
[01:46:59.650 --> 01:47:00.650]  I'll put it on.
[01:47:00.650 --> 01:47:01.650]  Oh, I forget.
[01:47:01.650 --> 01:47:04.650]  You, like, empty halfway through.
[01:47:04.650 --> 01:47:07.650]  Well, we're connoisseurs at this table, my friend.
[01:47:08.650 --> 01:47:11.650]  It's still connoisseur level if there's still green weed to be hit.
[01:47:11.650 --> 01:47:12.650]  That's okay.
[01:47:12.650 --> 01:47:14.650]  We're smoking on some sour diesel.
[01:47:14.650 --> 01:47:15.650]  It wasn't quite as empty as Jeff's.
[01:47:15.650 --> 01:47:16.650]  It's delicious.
[01:47:16.650 --> 01:47:17.650]  We had some dabs.
[01:47:17.650 --> 01:47:19.650]  Kevin made some wax for me this time.
[01:47:19.650 --> 01:47:22.650]  Usually, I get shattered, but he wanted to experiment and make some wax.
[01:47:22.650 --> 01:47:26.650]  I haven't for a while, so I wanted to make sure that it was like riding a bike, and I
[01:47:26.650 --> 01:47:28.650]  could still accomplish said task.
[01:47:29.650 --> 01:47:30.650]  Task accomplished.
[01:47:30.650 --> 01:47:32.650]  You did a well-done job.
[01:47:32.650 --> 01:47:35.650]  I like it because I could pick it up and just drop a big, fat glob on you.
[01:47:35.650 --> 01:47:37.650]  Sorry, that was my sweet stone.
[01:47:37.650 --> 01:47:38.650]  You're going...
[01:47:39.650 --> 01:47:40.650]  It's not good.
[01:47:40.650 --> 01:47:45.650]  For those of us who are less versed in wax, dabs, etc., the difference, sirs?
[01:47:45.650 --> 01:47:49.650]  Oh, the shatter, you can drop it, but it's harder to handle.
[01:47:49.650 --> 01:47:50.650]  The shatter is a little stickier.
[01:47:50.650 --> 01:47:53.650]  If your fingers are warm, it'll melt and get sticky and stick to your fingers.
[01:47:53.650 --> 01:47:56.650]  The wax, it doesn't stick as much.
[01:47:56.650 --> 01:48:01.650]  Kevin, since this is a topic, teach us a little bit about the difference between shatter and wax.
[01:48:01.650 --> 01:48:02.650]  They're essentially the same product.
[01:48:02.650 --> 01:48:04.650]  Or crumble.
[01:48:04.650 --> 01:48:06.650]  They're essentially the same product, just different consistencies.
[01:48:06.650 --> 01:48:12.650]  And towards the end of the process, you do a slightly different technique with each one.
[01:48:14.650 --> 01:48:21.650]  It involves timing, temperatures, agitation, things like that, and you can achieve the
[01:48:21.650 --> 01:48:24.650]  different consistencies, which is essentially all shatter and wax are.
[01:48:24.650 --> 01:48:27.650]  They're just different consistencies of the same thing.
[01:48:27.650 --> 01:48:29.650]  And a lot of people hate on wax.
[01:48:29.650 --> 01:48:31.650]  I tell everybody to stay on the mic.
[01:48:31.650 --> 01:48:33.650]  I'm over here bobbing back and forth like Stevie Wonder.
[01:48:33.650 --> 01:48:34.650]  I'm high, dude.
[01:48:35.650 --> 01:48:37.650]  Dab the fuck out, eating a sweet stone.
[01:48:37.650 --> 01:48:38.650]  It's a good night.
[01:48:38.650 --> 01:48:40.650]  It's a wonderful night, hanging out with two of my favorite bros, even.
[01:48:41.650 --> 01:48:42.650]  The highest guy in the room is working the most.
[01:48:42.650 --> 01:48:44.650]  A lot of people hate on shatter, too.
[01:48:44.650 --> 01:48:49.650]  There's some people that are just real into the wax, and that's why I like a lot of the conversations that go on
[01:48:49.650 --> 01:48:56.650]  with us in the 710 community, with the extract artists especially, is we're not sharing so much information
[01:48:56.650 --> 01:48:57.650]  with the public anymore.
[01:48:57.650 --> 01:49:04.650]  We're sharing it a lot with ourselves, and we're learning a lot more about what's better
[01:49:04.650 --> 01:49:07.650]  and what is actually going on with the product.
[01:49:07.650 --> 01:49:11.650]  So that's really nice to see how it continues to evolve and the knowledge continues to grow.
[01:49:11.650 --> 01:49:18.650]  So there is a lot of personal opinion on whether wax or shatter is preferred.
[01:49:18.650 --> 01:49:25.650]  There's a lot of opinion and some verification of one being cleaner than the other.
[01:49:25.650 --> 01:49:28.650]  So I'll leave that up to everybody to go ahead and do some research and read it.
[01:49:29.650 --> 01:49:31.650]  I'm going to kind of spill your beans.
[01:49:31.650 --> 01:49:38.650]  From what I have read from trusted sources, and I have not studied this, I have read this on Facebook from people that I respect.
[01:49:39.650 --> 01:49:41.650]  The wax is usually cleaner.
[01:49:42.650 --> 01:49:45.650]  It comes back with less residual solvents in there.
[01:49:45.650 --> 01:49:48.650]  Yes, that's what I have read as well.
[01:49:48.650 --> 01:49:52.650]  So the people that are hating the butters or the waxes, the butter, I'm going to say butter,
[01:49:52.650 --> 01:49:56.650]  I would consider butter goopier and stuff that we wouldn't dab.
[01:49:56.650 --> 01:49:57.650]  We wouldn't dab butter.
[01:49:57.650 --> 01:50:00.650]  If it's runny and dripping off your shit, I probably won't dab that.
[01:50:00.650 --> 01:50:01.650]  Exactly.
[01:50:01.650 --> 01:50:06.650]  Shatter, sap, snap, I'll hit that all day long.
[01:50:06.650 --> 01:50:07.650]  Some good crumble.
[01:50:07.650 --> 01:50:10.650]  If I want to put a little bit of it, I'm going to heat the nail up.
[01:50:10.650 --> 01:50:16.650]  Before I inhale, you're not going to notice if you gave me the dab, but I'm going to give it a little sizzle test before I inhale.
[01:50:16.650 --> 01:50:17.650]  I'm a hippie.
[01:50:17.650 --> 01:50:21.650]  I know how to blow a didgeridoo, so I know how to make it look like I'm inhaling, and I'm not.
[01:50:21.650 --> 01:50:26.650]  I can get rid of that smoke if it sizzles or tastes like doo-doo, and I won't take your dab.
[01:50:27.650 --> 01:50:29.650]  But if it looks good, I'll hit some wax.
[01:50:29.650 --> 01:50:33.650]  The reason I like the difference is the shatter, I got to use the dabber.
[01:50:33.650 --> 01:50:34.650]  I need a little dab tool.
[01:50:34.650 --> 01:50:36.650]  It takes a little more work, a little more effort.
[01:50:37.650 --> 01:50:40.650]  TaskRock says the tip of the dabber tends to chip the shatter in my eye.
[01:50:40.650 --> 01:50:41.650]  Ow.
[01:50:41.650 --> 01:50:42.650]  If you ever...
[01:50:42.650 --> 01:50:43.650]  She knows.
[01:50:43.650 --> 01:50:53.650]  The first time you buy shatter from a dispensary, you're going to take it home, and you're going to get your little dab tool, and you're going to stick it in that fucking shatter, and you're going to break off a piece, and it's going to fly across the room, and you're never going to find it.
[01:50:53.650 --> 01:50:54.650]  You're going to be pissed.
[01:50:54.650 --> 01:50:56.650]  That's one dab for your dead home.
[01:50:56.650 --> 01:50:57.650]  You just have to get used to that.
[01:50:57.650 --> 01:51:00.650]  Yeah, that's the way the world is.
[01:51:01.650 --> 01:51:02.650]  That's the way the world is.
[01:51:02.650 --> 01:51:07.650]  If you haven't experienced that yet, use your thumb and just rub your thumb on there and heat that shit up a little bit until it becomes pliable.
[01:51:07.650 --> 01:51:08.650]  You're going to have a big thumbprint.
[01:51:08.650 --> 01:51:09.650]  Pauly D will talk shit.
[01:51:09.650 --> 01:51:12.650]  Quit putting your fingerprints all over my damn shatter.
[01:51:12.650 --> 01:51:14.650]  But just get it in there, heat it up a little bit.
[01:51:14.650 --> 01:51:26.650]  But I like the wax because I can grab however big of a piece I want and squish it together and make a nice little ball, and then heat up my nail and just slam dunk it like I'm Michael Jordan on that motherfucker and get it nice.
[01:51:26.650 --> 01:51:31.650]  And the wax, the consistency makes it punch me harder on the hit.
[01:51:31.650 --> 01:51:33.650]  It seems like it does.
[01:51:33.650 --> 01:51:34.650]  It really does.
[01:51:34.650 --> 01:51:36.650]  The shatter, I'll admit it, shatter is slightly smoother.
[01:51:36.650 --> 01:51:38.650]  Sap is really smooth.
[01:51:38.650 --> 01:51:45.650]  But the fuck, I like that heavy, and it's not heavy like when you're smoking CO2 oil.
[01:51:45.650 --> 01:51:46.650]  I do not like.
[01:51:46.650 --> 01:51:47.650]  That's my personal preference.
[01:51:47.650 --> 01:51:50.650]  It always makes me feel like it's bubbly in my lungs.
[01:51:50.650 --> 01:51:51.650]  It's heavy.
[01:51:51.650 --> 01:51:52.650]  I'm drowning.
[01:51:52.650 --> 01:51:53.650]  I'm getting a weird flavor.
[01:51:53.650 --> 01:51:56.650]  But the wax gives me a pleasant punch.
[01:51:56.650 --> 01:52:02.650]  Remember when you're in high school and you take a big fucking bong hit and you'd be like, oh, I'm really, and it gives me that again.
[01:52:02.650 --> 01:52:03.650]  Yeah.
[01:52:03.650 --> 01:52:04.650]  I would agree with that.
[01:52:04.650 --> 01:52:10.650]  Maybe I need to reduce my dabbing since it's taking me a quarter gram dab of some good wax to get that punch to the face again.
[01:52:10.650 --> 01:52:12.650]  Smoke some of your flowers for a little bit.
[01:52:12.650 --> 01:52:14.650]  Yeah, I need to take a nice whip.
[01:52:14.650 --> 01:52:22.650]  I'm going to, I didn't want to talk about this until I had it more planned out, but a friend of ours, a collective friend, I think we all three know him.
[01:52:22.650 --> 01:52:27.650]  He's a doctor and I'm going to have him send me to a local drug testing facility.
[01:52:27.650 --> 01:52:28.650]  I'm going to wake up in the morning.
[01:52:28.650 --> 01:52:34.650]  I'm going to go to the doctor and he's going to write me the recommendation to go and somebody else is going to drive me.
[01:52:34.650 --> 01:52:47.650]  And on the way there, I'm going to take dabs and I'm going to drive to a drug testing facility and dab the fuck out like I normally would at a dab session, six or seven fat dabs and walk in there and let them take my blood and then measure my THC content.
[01:52:47.650 --> 01:52:50.650]  And then I'm going to go the whole day and not dab.
[01:52:50.650 --> 01:52:53.650]  Like after that session, I'll live the rest of the day without any dabs.
[01:52:53.650 --> 01:52:57.650]  And then I want to go in in the morning and go in and have them take my THC.
[01:52:57.650 --> 01:53:01.650]  And then I'm going to go another day and then try to, or maybe a couple of days later or something.
[01:53:01.650 --> 01:53:05.650]  Just I'm going to have to challenge myself and not take dabs, which would be fucking cool.
[01:53:05.650 --> 01:53:15.650]  But I want to measure myself at two or three different points, urine and blood and find out where I am right after I dab, where I am when I wake up in the morning.
[01:53:15.650 --> 01:53:23.650]  And maybe I should, I should include one more, but there's so many that I'd like to do, but I have to pay for each test out of my pocket.
[01:53:23.650 --> 01:53:24.650]  That's going to get a little crazy.
[01:53:24.650 --> 01:53:26.650]  And he's going to try to help me out.
[01:53:26.650 --> 01:53:31.650]  He's going to try to like make it not as expensive as it should be because he knows the people in the lab and such, but.
[01:53:31.650 --> 01:53:34.650]  That's got to be a fun conversation at the drug testing lab.
[01:53:34.650 --> 01:53:36.650]  I'm going to tell them what I'm doing.
[01:53:36.650 --> 01:53:37.650]  Right.
[01:53:37.650 --> 01:53:38.650]  And they'll listen to the podcast.
[01:53:38.650 --> 01:53:39.650]  Yeah.
[01:53:39.650 --> 01:53:40.650]  I love it.
[01:53:40.650 --> 01:53:41.650]  Yeah.
[01:53:41.650 --> 01:53:43.650]  But I want to see, my goal is to find out where we wake up.
[01:53:44.650 --> 01:53:47.650]  You don't dab as much as I do, but for your body weight, you keep up closely, little Kev.
[01:53:47.650 --> 01:53:48.650]  Oh, yeah.
[01:53:48.650 --> 01:53:49.650]  Yeah.
[01:53:49.650 --> 01:53:50.650]  And.
[01:53:50.650 --> 01:53:53.650]  I went home from work and did like 15 straight and went to bed the other day.
[01:53:53.650 --> 01:53:54.650]  You're a medical patient.
[01:53:54.650 --> 01:53:58.650]  You have shit that hurts and you've got a good valid reason and you like to take some dabs.
[01:53:58.650 --> 01:54:04.650]  So I want to find out where our nanograms of THC is in our blood to find out if we're legal to drive.
[01:54:04.650 --> 01:54:08.650]  Because when we're going to do an episode about DUIs and cannabis in Colorado.
[01:54:08.650 --> 01:54:10.650]  Did you just cut out in the headphones, Mike?
[01:54:10.650 --> 01:54:12.650]  It's doing something crazy.
[01:54:12.650 --> 01:54:14.650]  I think your channel has issues.
[01:54:14.650 --> 01:54:17.650]  We apologize for the tech difficulties.
[01:54:17.650 --> 01:54:18.650]  That requires.
[01:54:18.650 --> 01:54:20.650]  Whatever you did just fixed it.
[01:54:20.650 --> 01:54:21.650]  Cool.
[01:54:21.650 --> 01:54:22.650]  Boom.
[01:54:22.650 --> 01:54:23.650]  Okay.
[01:54:23.650 --> 01:54:24.650]  So the sweet stones dissolving and it's giving me a little.
[01:54:24.650 --> 01:54:25.650]  The throat.
[01:54:25.650 --> 01:54:26.650]  My throat was all clogged up.
[01:54:26.650 --> 01:54:27.650]  So excuse me.
[01:54:27.650 --> 01:54:29.650]  I had some wonderful sweet stone flavor in there.
[01:54:29.650 --> 01:54:33.650]  The first piece of the cotton candy is dissolved to where I need another one.
[01:54:33.650 --> 01:54:34.650]  That shit is delish.
[01:54:34.650 --> 01:54:35.650]  Nice.
[01:54:35.650 --> 01:54:36.650]  All the different colors.
[01:54:36.650 --> 01:54:38.650]  Every flavor I've had are amazing.
[01:54:39.650 --> 01:54:45.650]  I think I'm going to wait till this piece is completely gone and try the blue and see if it varies in flavor or if they just did them different colors to be cute.
[01:54:45.650 --> 01:54:48.650]  We're so spoiled here.
[01:54:48.650 --> 01:54:49.650]  Right.
[01:54:49.650 --> 01:54:52.650]  I talk to people in other states and they're like, I heard you can get brownies.
[01:54:52.650 --> 01:54:55.650]  It's just like, yeah, we can get brownies in 95.
[01:54:55.650 --> 01:54:59.650]  We've had store shelf brownies since what?
[01:54:59.650 --> 01:55:00.650]  2004.
[01:55:00.650 --> 01:55:02.650]  Mike and I worked at a dispensary.
[01:55:02.650 --> 01:55:03.650]  Insanely huge.
[01:55:03.650 --> 01:55:07.650]  Remember when we worked at Metamar and our friend, the baker would come in and we were bud tenders.
[01:55:07.650 --> 01:55:08.650]  I was a manager.
[01:55:08.650 --> 01:55:09.650]  Mike was my backup bud tender.
[01:55:09.650 --> 01:55:10.650]  I was a head bun tender.
[01:55:10.650 --> 01:55:11.650]  I guess you'd call me.
[01:55:11.650 --> 01:55:15.650]  And the boss would come in and this was before all the weird regulations.
[01:55:15.650 --> 01:55:17.650]  They would just make edibles at home.
[01:55:17.650 --> 01:55:18.650]  They call this the wild west.
[01:55:18.650 --> 01:55:20.650]  It's definitely what it was.
[01:55:20.650 --> 01:55:28.650]  They'd make these edibles at home and they would bring them in by the tray and they would have one set aside for Mike and I of everything that they made that they brought in for inventory that day.
[01:55:28.650 --> 01:55:31.650]  And sometimes there'd be a good six or seven pieces.
[01:55:31.650 --> 01:55:33.650]  They had fudge, that white fudge, bro.
[01:55:33.650 --> 01:55:36.650]  I will fight you for the last piece of that fudge every day.
[01:55:36.650 --> 01:55:37.650]  That shit is so good.
[01:55:37.650 --> 01:55:39.650]  And it got me high as giraffe pussy.
[01:55:39.650 --> 01:55:40.650]  Thank you, Joe Rogan.
[01:55:40.650 --> 01:55:42.650]  I miss the banana bread.
[01:55:42.650 --> 01:55:43.650]  The banana bread.
[01:55:43.650 --> 01:55:44.650]  The banana bread, dude.
[01:55:44.650 --> 01:55:49.650]  Not only was it delicious, it was like a kick to the face from a mule.
[01:55:49.650 --> 01:55:50.650]  I saw.
[01:55:50.650 --> 01:55:53.650]  The rest of the day was just a beautiful bliss.
[01:55:53.650 --> 01:55:57.650]  I saw a 200-pound man roll down two flights of stairs.
[01:55:57.650 --> 01:55:59.650]  Not one, not like a straight line.
[01:55:59.650 --> 01:56:00.650]  He had to turn.
[01:56:00.650 --> 01:56:04.650]  These stairs went straight down and turned to 180 and came back at you as they went down the second flight.
[01:56:04.650 --> 01:56:11.650]  He rolled down two flights of those stairs and giggled like a fucking cartoon character because of too much of that banana bread.
[01:56:11.650 --> 01:56:14.650]  Too many pieces of banana bread when he was upstairs.
[01:56:14.650 --> 01:56:19.650]  There would be times when I'd look at one of the bosses and be like, can somebody just do this for a minute?
[01:56:19.650 --> 01:56:20.650]  And they would laugh at me.
[01:56:20.650 --> 01:56:22.650]  They didn't care that I was too high to function.
[01:56:22.650 --> 01:56:23.650]  They would laugh.
[01:56:23.650 --> 01:56:28.650]  She'd walk in and set the tray down and, you know, traffic would stop for a minute.
[01:56:28.650 --> 01:56:29.650]  And she'd go, eat one of these.
[01:56:29.650 --> 01:56:30.650]  Tell me if it's any good.
[01:56:30.650 --> 01:56:31.650]  You go, all right.
[01:56:31.650 --> 01:56:32.650]  It's like 1105.
[01:56:32.650 --> 01:56:33.650]  We just opened.
[01:56:33.650 --> 01:56:35.650]  But yes, boss.
[01:56:35.650 --> 01:56:38.650]  And 15 minutes later, she'd walk by and go, how did it taste?
[01:56:38.650 --> 01:56:40.650]  And you'd say, it was delicious.
[01:56:40.650 --> 01:56:41.650]  And she'd say, cool.
[01:56:41.650 --> 01:56:42.650]  Try the fudge.
[01:56:42.650 --> 01:56:44.650]  Yes, boss.
[01:56:44.650 --> 01:56:47.650]  It was just, oh, what a dream job, people.
[01:56:47.650 --> 01:56:48.650]  Sorry.
[01:56:48.650 --> 01:56:49.650]  That was a lot.
[01:56:49.650 --> 01:56:52.650]  The banana bread, the fudge, those were my favorites.
[01:56:52.650 --> 01:56:53.650]  Definitely.
[01:56:53.650 --> 01:56:57.650]  They made some sugar cookies that were shaped like wheat leaves that I could eat like a million of those in a shift.
[01:56:57.650 --> 01:56:59.650]  Oh, just so good.
[01:56:59.650 --> 01:57:02.650]  I didn't like caramel, but I heard the caramels there were amazing.
[01:57:02.650 --> 01:57:03.650]  Yep.
[01:57:03.650 --> 01:57:04.650]  I apologize.
[01:57:04.650 --> 01:57:06.650]  My mic just got ridiculously freaking loud.
[01:57:06.650 --> 01:57:09.650]  We had a really good chef back in the Metamar days.
[01:57:10.650 --> 01:57:11.650]  Random question.
[01:57:11.650 --> 01:57:13.650]  Hey, Kevin, if you could hear any song right now, what would it be?
[01:57:14.650 --> 01:57:15.650]  Any song right now?
[01:57:15.650 --> 01:57:16.650]  Yeah.
[01:57:16.650 --> 01:57:17.650]  You're high.
[01:57:17.650 --> 01:57:18.650]  I asked you this on the spot question.
[01:57:18.650 --> 01:57:19.650]  Just fuck shit up.
[01:57:19.650 --> 01:57:20.650]  Jesus.
[01:57:20.650 --> 01:57:21.650]  Jesus?
[01:57:21.650 --> 01:57:22.650]  I don't know that song.
[01:57:22.650 --> 01:57:23.650]  No, it's not Jesus, bro.
[01:57:23.650 --> 01:57:24.650]  Jesus, bro?
[01:57:24.650 --> 01:57:25.650]  That sounds like a ween song.
[01:57:25.650 --> 01:57:26.650]  Oh, my God.
[01:57:27.650 --> 01:57:28.650]  You failed at my test.
[01:57:28.650 --> 01:57:29.650]  Yeah, I failed.
[01:57:29.650 --> 01:57:30.650]  I don't know.
[01:57:30.650 --> 01:57:31.650]  There's too many.
[01:57:31.650 --> 01:57:32.650]  I have like five songs in my head.
[01:57:32.650 --> 01:57:33.650]  Let's hear one of them.
[01:57:33.650 --> 01:57:34.650]  The Mollusk.
[01:57:34.650 --> 01:57:35.650]  Okay.
[01:57:35.650 --> 01:57:36.650]  And that is a ween song.
[01:57:36.650 --> 01:57:37.650]  Yeah, that's all I said.
[01:57:37.650 --> 01:57:38.650]  I know your head a little bit.
[01:57:39.650 --> 01:57:40.650]  Welcome to the group.
[01:57:41.650 --> 01:57:42.650]  What else you got?
[01:57:43.650 --> 01:57:44.650]  Work hard, play hard.
[01:57:45.650 --> 01:57:46.650]  Some Wiz Khalifa right there.
[01:57:47.650 --> 01:57:49.650]  That's completely different end of the scale for you.
[01:57:49.650 --> 01:57:50.650]  That's cool.
[01:57:50.650 --> 01:57:51.650]  You got to love that.
[01:57:51.650 --> 01:57:52.650]  Are you going to the Wiz Khalifa Snoop show?
[01:57:52.650 --> 01:57:53.650]  Dude, I wish.
[01:57:54.650 --> 01:57:55.650]  I didn't end up paying for a concert ticket in time.
[01:57:55.650 --> 01:57:58.650]  I'm not sure how I feel about paying $130 for a concert ticket.
[01:57:59.650 --> 01:58:00.650]  Partially, I love Red Rocks.
[01:58:00.650 --> 01:58:02.650]  Don't get me wrong, but it's April 20th.
[01:58:02.650 --> 01:58:03.650]  I went last year on 420.
[01:58:03.650 --> 01:58:04.650]  You went with me, bro.
[01:58:04.650 --> 01:58:05.650]  It was cold.
[01:58:05.650 --> 01:58:06.650]  It was going to be cold.
[01:58:07.650 --> 01:58:09.650]  I've read that it's going to snow by the weather reports,
[01:58:09.650 --> 01:58:10.650]  but that's too far away to judge.
[01:58:11.650 --> 01:58:12.650]  It's Morrison.
[01:58:12.650 --> 01:58:14.650]  If you didn't know it was going to be cold, you're not from here.
[01:58:14.650 --> 01:58:15.650]  Yeah, I've been there.
[01:58:15.650 --> 01:58:17.650]  I've seen widespread panic that are nine or 12 times,
[01:58:17.650 --> 01:58:19.650]  and it's never been as freaking cold as it was.
[01:58:20.650 --> 01:58:21.650]  I've never seen either of those artists,
[01:58:21.650 --> 01:58:23.650]  and those are two of my favorite artists for sure.
[01:58:24.650 --> 01:58:26.650]  And you probably pay $60 or $70 to see either of them.
[01:58:26.650 --> 01:58:29.650]  You probably pay $60 or $70 to see either one on a headline tour.
[01:58:30.650 --> 01:58:32.650]  Why pay extra just because it's on 420?
[01:58:32.650 --> 01:58:34.650]  There's a lot of shit going on there.
[01:58:34.650 --> 01:58:35.650]  You're not really paying extra.
[01:58:35.650 --> 01:58:36.650]  You're paying for each artist.
[01:58:36.650 --> 01:58:37.650]  Each one separately.
[01:58:38.650 --> 01:58:39.650]  If they both do a good hour, I'd be cool.
[01:58:39.650 --> 01:58:40.650]  I'd love to go see Snoop.
[01:58:41.650 --> 01:58:43.650]  I want to see him on a more indoor venue.
[01:58:44.650 --> 01:58:45.650]  I finished the pink piece of the Sweet Stone.
[01:58:46.650 --> 01:58:47.650]  I'm letting that flavor get out.
[01:58:47.650 --> 01:58:49.650]  I'm about to throw in the blue piece and see if it tastes any differently.
[01:58:56.520 --> 01:58:57.520]  That's the fucking rudest thing I could have ever done.
[01:58:57.520 --> 01:58:58.520]  That's fucking gross.
[01:58:58.520 --> 01:58:59.520]  The sound of hard candy.
[01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:02.520]  That was fucking disgusting.
[01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:03.520]  It tastes the same.
[01:59:04.520 --> 01:59:05.520]  As far as my taste buds can tell.
[01:59:05.520 --> 01:59:09.520]  It may have a thicker, more, it may have more flavor.
[01:59:10.520 --> 01:59:12.520]  But my tongue is going numb from all the medicine.
[01:59:12.520 --> 01:59:13.520]  I'm sucking on them real slowly.
[01:59:14.520 --> 01:59:15.520]  I noticed last time I ate these,
[01:59:15.520 --> 01:59:16.520]  I ate the whole pack as slowly as I could,
[01:59:16.520 --> 01:59:18.520]  sucking on them in a comedy show to not have cotton mouth
[01:59:18.520 --> 01:59:20.520]  and not have to piss every 10 minutes.
[01:59:21.520 --> 01:59:22.520]  And they work greatly for that.
[01:59:22.520 --> 01:59:24.520]  By the way, if you need to go somewhere and just suck on some candy,
[01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:25.520]  these are the way to do it.
[01:59:26.520 --> 01:59:27.520]  My tongue went numb though,
[01:59:27.520 --> 01:59:28.520]  and my lips went all numb.
[01:59:28.520 --> 01:59:29.520]  I was trying to talk to people and I was like,
[01:59:29.520 --> 01:59:30.520]  Hey, what the fuck?
[01:59:31.520 --> 01:59:32.520]  I got to get that figured out real quick.
[01:59:33.520 --> 01:59:34.520]  This little girl was tiny.
[01:59:34.520 --> 01:59:38.520]  She got up on a bar stool and measured my dreadlocks to her body height.
[01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:41.520]  I bet your dreadlocks are as tall as me.
[01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:42.520]  And she got up on a bar stool and measured.
[01:59:42.520 --> 01:59:43.520]  It was cute.
[01:59:43.520 --> 01:59:44.520]  All right.
[01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:46.520]  I've got a topic.
[01:59:46.520 --> 01:59:47.520]  I try to have a topic for the show,
[01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:49.520]  not just a bunch of dudes sitting here getting stoned.
[01:59:49.520 --> 01:59:51.520]  Although it's been fucking good at that today.
[01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:52.520]  That will happen.
[01:59:52.520 --> 01:59:53.520]  We did some dabs.
[01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:54.520]  We're going to do another one.
[01:59:55.520 --> 01:59:56.520]  I was ordered to do this.
[01:59:57.520 --> 01:59:58.520]  You're doing a good job.
[01:59:58.520 --> 02:00:00.520]  Before we even started, the leader of this podcast.
[02:00:01.520 --> 02:00:03.520]  If I ordered you, I apologize.
[02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:04.520]  I didn't mean to order.
[02:00:04.520 --> 02:00:07.520]  He was like, keep that bowl filled and through the bag of weed.
[02:00:07.520 --> 02:00:08.520]  Tasks were assigned.
[02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:11.520]  If somebody looks at you and throws a bag of weed in a pipe,
[02:00:11.520 --> 02:00:12.520]  Jen's like, keep this bowl.
[02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:13.520]  I'm not complaining.
[02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:15.520]  You got to kind of just man up and keep that shit full.
[02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:16.520]  I'm not complaining at all.
[02:00:17.520 --> 02:00:18.520]  Yes, boss.
[02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:19.520]  All right.
[02:00:19.520 --> 02:00:20.520]  We just had a conversation about Shatter and Wax.
[02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:22.520]  Shatter or Wax, Kevin?
[02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:24.520]  Let's do Shatter.
[02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:25.520]  All right, Mike.
[02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:28.520]  I'll go with Wax.
[02:00:28.520 --> 02:00:29.520]  All right.
[02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:30.520]  We got one of each here.
[02:00:30.520 --> 02:00:31.520]  We got a Shatter dab for Kev bro.
[02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:37.520]  The coughing you hear from me is no comment on the product.
[02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:41.520]  We got a why Mike can Mike is I'm surprised I'm not coughing from looking at the hash.
[02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:49.520]  I can feel the cough building now just thinking about the dab to come and that is entirely tobacco use related.
[02:00:50.520 --> 02:00:51.520]  I was going to say, don't smoke tobacco.
[02:00:52.520 --> 02:00:53.520]  Have issues with dabs.
[02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:56.520]  Those are the people I see having the most issues with coughing.
[02:00:57.520 --> 02:01:04.520]  I'm really curious if our listeners enjoy us just chilling out, smoking some dabs and bullshitting or if they like it better when I'm reading and getting the news.
[02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:06.520]  So do me a favor.
[02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:07.520]  Tweet me.
[02:01:07.520 --> 02:01:08.520]  Tweet it.
[02:01:08.520 --> 02:01:09.520]  It's at I Grow Culture.
[02:01:09.520 --> 02:01:11.520]  Because I'd like to do a show that is for the people.
[02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:13.520]  It's not just for us to sit here and get dabbed out.
[02:01:13.520 --> 02:01:14.520]  I'd like to serve a purpose.
[02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:19.520]  The first two were very news related and this one so far has been very sit around dab related.
[02:01:20.520 --> 02:01:21.520]  That'll happen.
[02:01:22.520 --> 02:01:25.520]  It's only been 20 minutes and let's just bullshit and we got to get to the point.
[02:01:25.520 --> 02:01:27.520]  We do have points and things we are going to talk about.
[02:01:28.520 --> 02:01:29.520]  I made a new friend.
[02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:30.520]  Stay tuned.
[02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:31.520]  Who is helping me.
[02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:36.520]  That was the best transition ever.
[02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:41.520]  I just packed up dabs for both of these guys on the two dabbers I've got available and did not save a dab for myself.
[02:01:41.520 --> 02:01:42.520]  You want the beer rig bro?
[02:01:43.520 --> 02:01:44.520]  Yeah.
[02:01:44.520 --> 02:01:45.520]  Purple beer rig.
[02:01:45.520 --> 02:01:46.520]  Purple drippy beer rig.
[02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:47.520]  I sure do.
[02:01:48.520 --> 02:01:49.520]  I'm going to hand you the dome.
[02:01:50.520 --> 02:01:51.520]  Got it.
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:52.520]  Got the dome.
[02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:53.520]  Got the sexy beer glass.
[02:01:54.520 --> 02:01:57.520]  Shatter dab on the highly educated carb cap.
[02:01:58.520 --> 02:01:59.520]  What was this one?
[02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:00.520]  Go for it bro.
[02:02:00.520 --> 02:02:01.520]  I'll let you do the work.
[02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:02.520]  I forgot what strain this was.
[02:02:02.520 --> 02:02:03.520]  That's Jack the Ripper from my garden.
[02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:05.520]  It's actually bred by TGA Subcool.
[02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:06.520]  Shout out TGA Subcool.
[02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:08.520]  TGA Genetics.
[02:02:09.520 --> 02:02:10.520]  I got this candy in my mouth.
[02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:11.520]  I feel like a rude asshole.
[02:02:11.520 --> 02:02:12.520]  It's so good.
[02:02:12.520 --> 02:02:13.520]  I don't give a shit though.
[02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:15.520]  It's not melt the dab.
[02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:17.520]  I do another podcast.
[02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:18.520]  I'm going to give them a shout out.
[02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:21.520]  I do a podcast called 719 the blocks with my friend Wade Ridley.
[02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:23.520]  Shameless plug there.
[02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:24.520]  Listen to it.
[02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:25.520]  It's much more.
[02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:26.520]  It's not as dabby as this one.
[02:02:26.520 --> 02:02:27.520]  It is entertaining.
[02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:28.520]  It's a good show.
[02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:30.520]  But Wade, I handed him the dabber ready to go.
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:31.520]  We're live doing a show.
[02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:35.520]  And he put his mouth on the microphone and dropped the dabber.
[02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:37.520]  Like he held the rig in front of him.
[02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:41.520]  He didn't burn anything, but he dropped the dab on the nail and inhaled into the mic.
[02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:42.520]  It was priceless.
[02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:43.520]  I called him out on the show.
[02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:45.520]  So if you guys catch that episode, it'll be funny.
[02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:48.520]  Chugging that sucker.
[02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:52.520]  No, I enjoy every episode of that starts out with a fuck you mic.
[02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:53.520]  So fuck you, Wade.
[02:02:53.520 --> 02:02:55.520]  That's because you said that the intro is monotone.
[02:02:55.520 --> 02:02:56.520]  Oh, I know.
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:02:57.520]  And the intro is monotone.
[02:02:57.520 --> 02:02:58.520]  But I don't mind.
[02:02:58.520 --> 02:03:00.520]  Every time I fire up a show, I start with a good laugh because of that.
[02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:04.520]  719 the blocks podcast is what we're ranting about.
[02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:07.520]  That's a tasty dab of Jack the Ripper.
[02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:09.520]  The last batch did not come out that good.
[02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:11.520]  The last Jack the Ripper batch that we did.
[02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:13.520]  I think that's that batch, bro.
[02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:14.520]  It's the very end of it.
[02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:15.520]  No, the.
[02:03:16.520 --> 02:03:19.520]  Yeah, I know the batch we did before this one.
[02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:20.520]  Ah, okay.
[02:03:20.520 --> 02:03:21.520]  The Ripper.
[02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:22.520]  Yeah, the past one.
[02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:26.520]  I had a phenotype that I was trying to get something out of that phenotype,
[02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:28.520]  and it wasn't what I was looking for.
[02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:29.520]  And I tried to be stubborn.
[02:03:29.520 --> 02:03:30.520]  I should have gotten rid of it.
[02:03:30.520 --> 02:03:32.520]  Nothing against that pheno, that strain.
[02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:33.520]  I'll grow Jack again.
[02:03:33.520 --> 02:03:36.520]  But that pheno wasn't a keeper for me.
[02:03:36.520 --> 02:03:37.520]  So it's gone.
[02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:38.520]  We'll get I've got a five pack of that.
[02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:40.520]  We'll run that again and find that lemon pheno.
[02:03:42.520 --> 02:03:44.520]  This run tastes much better in my.
[02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:45.520]  Hold on, you need the dome.
[02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:47.520]  Mike is going to cough like a champ because.
[02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:48.520]  I am.
[02:03:48.520 --> 02:03:50.520]  It's not a little baby dab that I gave him.
[02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:54.520]  Could just be the difference in technique from a couple months ago to now.
[02:03:55.520 --> 02:03:56.520]  Yeah, you're learning a lot, dude.
[02:03:56.520 --> 02:03:57.520]  Something.
[02:03:57.520 --> 02:03:58.520]  I learn a lot from you.
[02:03:58.520 --> 02:03:59.520]  Practice makes perfect, yo.
[02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:00.520]  I'm often impressed by the.
[02:04:00.520 --> 02:04:01.520]  I don't really do much different.
[02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:03.520]  The knowledge that I see you gain.
[02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:04.520]  Because we're hanging out.
[02:04:04.520 --> 02:04:05.520]  You're not going anywhere.
[02:04:05.520 --> 02:04:07.520]  So I'm like, where the fuck did he learn that?
[02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:08.520]  Right?
[02:04:10.520 --> 02:04:11.520]  Where did that idea just come from?
[02:04:11.520 --> 02:04:13.520]  You never know when I'm sitting in my corner.
[02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:15.520]  Remember the turpenoid question I texted you about?
[02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:18.520]  Can I do you want to discuss that on the air?
[02:04:18.520 --> 02:04:19.520]  Is that something you'd rather keep on the down low?
[02:04:23.520 --> 02:04:24.520]  Well, I don't remember it.
[02:04:25.520 --> 02:04:26.520]  OK, here's my idea.
[02:04:26.520 --> 02:04:27.520]  And let's do it.
[02:04:29.520 --> 02:04:32.520]  We talked about cold traps and pulling Mike just goes wander off.
[02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:34.520]  He's not going to cough into the mic.
[02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:35.520]  He's too respectful for that.
[02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:37.520]  If we don't if we don't hear from him in 10 minutes, we got to go find him.
[02:04:38.520 --> 02:04:39.520]  Call Dominos.
[02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:40.520]  Called off.
[02:04:40.520 --> 02:04:41.520]  I don't know what that would do.
[02:04:41.520 --> 02:04:42.520]  But OK.
[02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:47.520]  This episode will be train wreck number three.
[02:04:48.520 --> 02:04:54.520]  So we're using cold traps and we're pulling out the gases and the leftover contaminants.
[02:04:54.520 --> 02:04:56.520]  And we're also separating turpenoids.
[02:04:57.520 --> 02:04:59.520]  And then you said something that caught my attention.
[02:04:59.520 --> 02:05:04.520]  Reintroduce the turpenoids back into the finished product so that it's tasty and contains turpenoids,
[02:05:04.520 --> 02:05:06.520]  which also affect your high and your medicinal qualities.
[02:05:07.520 --> 02:05:12.520]  Could I hypothetically save that cold trap, set those turpenoids aside,
[02:05:12.520 --> 02:05:16.520]  run another batch, gather those turpenoids, set them aside, run another batch
[02:05:16.520 --> 02:05:20.520]  and introduce all three batches of turpenoids into one batch of smaller hash?
[02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:22.520]  You could do that.
[02:05:22.520 --> 02:05:24.520]  There is there is a point of overdoing.
[02:05:25.520 --> 02:05:29.520]  That takes a little bit of a explanation.
[02:05:30.520 --> 02:05:32.520]  But I could imagine there's a point of overdoing everything.
[02:05:32.520 --> 02:05:33.520]  Yeah.
[02:05:33.520 --> 02:05:38.520]  So I think it would take some experimentation to figure out what what would be overdoing
[02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:40.520]  and what would be where you wanted it to be.
[02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:46.520]  And I think also a better use would to not necessarily get more flavor,
[02:05:46.520 --> 02:05:52.520]  but to save different terpenes that you trap from different cannabis.
[02:05:52.520 --> 02:05:58.520]  So because there's different concentrations of different terpene molecules.
[02:05:58.520 --> 02:05:59.520]  OK.
[02:05:59.520 --> 02:06:04.520]  So take those different terpene molecules, combine those in a ratio for certain ailments
[02:06:05.520 --> 02:06:10.520]  because the turpenoids have been have been known to help with certain conditions
[02:06:10.520 --> 02:06:12.520]  and help with how we receive the cannabinoids.
[02:06:13.520 --> 02:06:16.520]  So I think that would be a better and more practical use for it
[02:06:17.520 --> 02:06:21.520]  is the combination of certain terpene profiles.
[02:06:22.520 --> 02:06:26.520]  Does the future bring us isolating the cannabinoids specifically?
[02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:28.520]  Are we going to learn?
[02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:33.520]  I think we're going to be able to in the future definitely isolate
[02:06:34.520 --> 02:06:38.520]  several cannabinoids, if not all of them, and several terpenoids as well,
[02:06:38.520 --> 02:06:43.520]  readily identify them and separate them, probably through a couple.
[02:06:44.520 --> 02:06:49.520]  It would take a couple of different processes, like almost like a condensation reaction,
[02:06:49.520 --> 02:06:56.520]  along with your normal solvent reactions to get specific.
[02:06:58.520 --> 02:06:59.520]  I follow you. Yeah.
[02:06:59.520 --> 02:07:01.520]  Specific molecules out of each one.
[02:07:01.520 --> 02:07:02.520]  We're not going to get...
[02:07:02.520 --> 02:07:05.520]  We'd have to purify it like they do gases and things.
[02:07:06.520 --> 02:07:11.520]  You know, like Addison was, I think Addison mentioned,
[02:07:11.520 --> 02:07:14.520]  or I may have mentioned on one of the past shows,
[02:07:14.520 --> 02:07:18.520]  the butane and pentane and stuff all comes from petroleum
[02:07:18.520 --> 02:07:22.520]  that's refined into those gases based on their boiling points.
[02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:30.520]  So it's going to take several reactions like that to be able to refine terpenoids, cannabinoids.
[02:07:30.520 --> 02:07:33.520]  I think we're going to start to discover the differences in them
[02:07:33.520 --> 02:07:39.520]  and each molecular structure's specific melting points, boiling points and things,
[02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:43.520]  and we'll be able to separate that and reintroduce them with each other eventually.
[02:07:43.520 --> 02:07:48.520]  So we can separate the whole pie, heat the pieces we need to cook off the...
[02:07:48.520 --> 02:07:51.520]  I don't know if it's cooking off, but boiling off, dissipate,
[02:07:51.520 --> 02:07:55.520]  maybe the word I'm looking for, dissipate the gases and other products we don't want,
[02:07:55.520 --> 02:07:57.520]  filter out contaminants and waxes.
[02:07:58.520 --> 02:08:00.520]  Will that bring us to...
[02:08:00.520 --> 02:08:04.520]  I see a cylinder, a graduated cylinder, I think that's the word,
[02:08:04.520 --> 02:08:09.520]  with different layers of sediments in it that'll show waxes.
[02:08:09.520 --> 02:08:11.520]  Eventually what I'm headed for, what I want to know in the end,
[02:08:11.520 --> 02:08:13.520]  are we going to be able to pull apart pesticides?
[02:08:13.520 --> 02:08:17.520]  Like are we going to say, here's all the pesticide that was found in your plant.
[02:08:17.520 --> 02:08:18.520]  Are we going to get to that?
[02:08:18.520 --> 02:08:21.520]  As the research continues, I bet we can. I don't see why not.
[02:08:21.520 --> 02:08:25.520]  The guys at Steep Hill can identify a pesticide in a plant
[02:08:25.520 --> 02:08:27.520]  that was treated while in early veg.
[02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:30.520]  They can identify it in a dried and finished flower.
[02:08:30.520 --> 02:08:32.520]  We're already at that stage.
[02:08:32.520 --> 02:08:37.520]  Also, you got to think about what Samir was saying a second ago.
[02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:43.520]  They're already breeding plants to be 15 to 1 CBD THC ratios.
[02:08:43.520 --> 02:08:48.520]  They're already on that stage of separating stuff in the plant stage.
[02:08:49.520 --> 02:08:57.520]  The dabbing concentrates in relative time aspect is much newer than growing weed.
[02:08:57.520 --> 02:08:58.520]  Right.
[02:08:58.520 --> 02:09:03.520]  We're very early in our research and our study with what can be done
[02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:05.520]  and how it can be done.
[02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:07.520]  It's already moved very, very, very quickly.
[02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:10.520]  I think as more people, and with the legalization,
[02:09:10.520 --> 02:09:13.520]  more people like PhDs in chemistry and things like that
[02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:16.520]  that know a lot about the subjects come into it,
[02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:22.520]  that'll start to teach the whole community about all of it.
[02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:26.520]  Steep Hill is a perfect example of that. Perfect example.
[02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:28.520]  Those guys are crushing it.
[02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:31.520]  One thing that I mentioned on Facebook today on somebody's post,
[02:09:31.520 --> 02:09:34.520]  they were talking about CBD and how CBD helps them.
[02:09:34.520 --> 02:09:39.520]  I want to remind people, don't forget about the other cannabinoids, the terpenoids.
[02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:42.520]  I try to make people understand.
[02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:44.520]  While I was off.
[02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:46.520]  We can identify 60 of them right now.
[02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:49.520]  There have got to be a lot more because we're discovering new shit every day.
[02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:51.520]  Go ahead. You've got something fancy to say.
[02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:55.520]  While I was off coughing, I was thinking that what you two were talking about,
[02:09:55.520 --> 02:10:00.520]  Sanjay Gupta was just talking about in his last Weed 2 Special,
[02:10:00.520 --> 02:10:03.520]  that he just, excuse me while I cough a little bit more.
[02:10:03.520 --> 02:10:05.520]  Dabs are going to do that to you.
[02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:08.520]  Dabs just ruined me for a minute.
[02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:11.520]  What you two have been talking about is the very forefront
[02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:14.520]  of something he mentioned in his show called the entourage effect,
[02:10:14.520 --> 02:10:17.520]  or at least that's what they're calling it now in medical circles.
[02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:22.520]  What that is is the different cannabinoids, the 60 of them that you were just talking about,
[02:10:22.520 --> 02:10:27.520]  working together to produce amazing medical effects.
[02:10:27.520 --> 02:10:33.520]  Part of the hard sell in medical marijuana is it's so useful treating so many different things.
[02:10:33.520 --> 02:10:35.520]  When someone doesn't believe you from the get-go,
[02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:38.520]  when you tell them that it helps cancer, epilepsy, AIDS,
[02:10:38.520 --> 02:10:41.520]  and the list goes on and on, they think you're lying.
[02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:47.520]  It turns out that it's just different combinations of these different cannabinoids
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:50.520]  having amazing effects all over the body.
[02:10:50.520 --> 02:10:51.520]  Right.
[02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:55.520]  You two are on the forefront of that with some of the work you're doing.
[02:10:55.520 --> 02:11:00.520]  It's crazy that it's happening in places like it's happening
[02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:04.520]  instead of research labs and research laboratories across the US because of the law.
[02:11:04.520 --> 02:11:05.520]  It's just silly.
[02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:08.520]  I've got to point out that I'm really thankful and grateful.
[02:11:08.520 --> 02:11:11.520]  I don't want to point out whatever I am thankful to,
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:14.520]  but whatever you believe in, I'm fucking thankful to that
[02:11:14.520 --> 02:11:18.520]  because I've got such a really cool position where I get to grow a medical cannabis product.
[02:11:18.520 --> 02:11:21.520]  Both of these guys sitting at my table, I'm their caregiver.
[02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:23.520]  I'm their medical marijuana supplier and caregiver.
[02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:27.520]  I get to talk with my bro Kev and see what hurts, what doesn't feel good.
[02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:30.520]  He says, dude, I really like this strain that you grow.
[02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:34.520]  It makes my X not X and my smile go smile.
[02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:38.520]  For me, and you just smile like a dipshit when I said that,
[02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:42.520]  but that face when you smoke the weed that I grow to make you not feel like shit,
[02:11:42.520 --> 02:11:44.520]  that's golden to me, bro.
[02:11:44.520 --> 02:11:45.520]  Same thing for you, Mike.
[02:11:45.520 --> 02:11:47.520]  I know you love my grateful dog.
[02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:49.520]  I was hurting when I got here today.
[02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:51.520]  It's been a rough week at work.
[02:11:51.520 --> 02:11:55.520]  I've been hauling a lot of heavy things up a lot of stairs.
[02:11:55.520 --> 02:11:58.520]  Within half an hour of getting here, I was pain-free.
[02:11:58.520 --> 02:12:01.520]  That's all due to the medicine you produce.
[02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:04.520]  It just angers me when people say it's not medicine.
[02:12:04.520 --> 02:12:07.520]  I read that a dozen times today.
[02:12:07.520 --> 02:12:12.520]  Or when I read about CBD-only legislation, finally somebody's listening,
[02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:15.520]  but they're clearly not paying enough attention to what's being said.
[02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:21.520]  If they're taking away CBD-only legislation, it's actually going to help anyone.
[02:12:21.520 --> 02:12:22.520]  Yeah.
[02:12:22.520 --> 02:12:24.520]  You respect the whole plant, not just one part of it.
[02:12:24.520 --> 02:12:26.520]  Definitely need the full profile of everything.
[02:12:26.520 --> 02:12:30.520]  That's what I try to explain to any patients or customers I get in the dispensary I work at now.
[02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:35.520]  That's one thing I really try to push, is that this entire profile of this plant is very important.
[02:12:35.520 --> 02:12:40.520]  That's why concentrates really help so much, because it can concentrate that profile of that plant.
[02:12:40.520 --> 02:12:43.520]  It's about the whole plant, not just teeny pieces of it.
[02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:47.520]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:48.520]  All right.
[02:12:48.520 --> 02:12:50.520]  That kind of brings me to another topic that I want to discuss.
[02:12:50.520 --> 02:12:53.520]  I did have something lined up for the show.
[02:12:53.520 --> 02:12:57.520]  The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment is actually attempting to pass a bill
[02:12:57.520 --> 02:13:06.520]  to limit caregivers to six plants per patient and a limit of five patients per caregiver,
[02:13:06.520 --> 02:13:08.520]  which is going to be a cap.
[02:13:08.520 --> 02:13:09.520]  Did I say that right?
[02:13:09.520 --> 02:13:10.520]  You gave me a funny face.
[02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:13.520]  No, my Mountain Dew bottle sounds crazy loud.
[02:13:13.520 --> 02:13:16.520]  My headphones, no matter where I move it, it gets louder.
[02:13:16.520 --> 02:13:22.520]  They're trying to make it to where a caregiver with six patients or with five patients,
[02:13:22.520 --> 02:13:25.520]  and including yourself if you want to grow medicine for yourself,
[02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:27.520]  but they don't even allow a number for that.
[02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:32.520]  They want to make it to where a private caregiver is capped out at 30 plants total.
[02:13:32.520 --> 02:13:39.520]  Right now, you're able to go, if you go to the medical marijuana doctor and you pay your regular fee,
[02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:44.520]  the doctor should see you, examine you, and write you your recommendation,
[02:13:44.520 --> 02:13:47.520]  and that comes with a standardized count of six plants.
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:52.520]  You can have three of those plants in flower and three of those plants in the veg stage,
[02:13:52.520 --> 02:13:54.520]  which means some are budding and some are not.
[02:13:54.520 --> 02:13:56.520]  You've got to read your own book to get that far with me.
[02:13:56.520 --> 02:14:00.520]  To even get to what we're talking about now, there's a whole lot of history.
[02:14:00.520 --> 02:14:02.520]  I'm going to try to catch this up.
[02:14:02.520 --> 02:14:08.520]  There are a lot of people who made crazy decisions to get us here, but this is what legislatures decided.
[02:14:08.520 --> 02:14:09.520]  Right.
[02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:13.520]  I have a nice little article written by a friend of mine who's very well written,
[02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:16.520]  and I'm going to read through it and try to do the best I can.
[02:14:16.520 --> 02:14:19.520]  I want to give people an update on what's going on.
[02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:22.520]  Right now, they write your card.
[02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:27.520]  If you are, I'm going to use your old man as an example.
[02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:32.520]  He requires a little more medicine than some people because he's got a condition that we need to supply him with.
[02:14:32.520 --> 02:14:33.520]  Yeah.
[02:14:33.520 --> 02:14:36.520]  The doctor knows that because he's met with a doctor, and the doctor said,
[02:14:36.520 --> 02:14:38.520]  holy shit, you've got a condition.
[02:14:38.520 --> 02:14:40.520]  We've got to get you treated.
[02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:41.520]  Who's your caregiver?
[02:14:41.520 --> 02:14:42.520]  How does he grow?
[02:14:42.520 --> 02:14:43.520]  How much medicine do you need?
[02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:46.520]  How is your grow going to make that much medicine?
[02:14:46.520 --> 02:14:47.520]  Okay, here's that many plants.
[02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:48.520]  They send it into the registry.
[02:14:48.520 --> 02:14:50.520]  He's legit.
[02:14:50.520 --> 02:14:54.520]  His caregiver has set up a grow to supply that much medicine for him,
[02:14:54.520 --> 02:14:58.520]  and that caregiver also has more patients that he's responsible for.
[02:14:58.520 --> 02:15:01.520]  So he's got a certain amount of people he's responsible for taking care of.
[02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:06.520]  He's going to grow this many plants, produce this many ounces of weed for this many people.
[02:15:06.520 --> 02:15:07.520]  We've got it thought of.
[02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:08.520]  People are taken care of.
[02:15:08.520 --> 02:15:13.520]  Now, they want to chop that down to only 30 plants,
[02:15:13.520 --> 02:15:16.520]  and now people are going to run out of medicine early
[02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:21.520]  because if I'm not able, you guys, I've got five patients that I'm responsible for,
[02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:23.520]  plus myself, and I know how to grow.
[02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:27.520]  I know how to pull weight off of a plant, and these guys can smoke some weed.
[02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:30.520]  Put it mildly.
[02:15:30.520 --> 02:15:34.520]  Between the raw flowers that we smoke, flowers is the buds for the people that aren't in the industry
[02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:35.520]  or aren't caught up on terms.
[02:15:35.520 --> 02:15:39.520]  When we say flower, we just mean buds, dried and cured, manicured buds.
[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:40.520]  That's flowers.
[02:15:40.520 --> 02:15:43.520]  Concentrates, I'm usually talking about some BHO, some DABS.
[02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:47.520]  Between the flowers and the DABS and the edibles that these guys require,
[02:15:47.520 --> 02:15:50.520]  I need to grow more than what I'm actually.
[02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:53.520]  I'm not doing it, but I could use more plants.
[02:15:53.520 --> 02:15:58.520]  I could definitely use an increase in your guys' numbers because you guys like to medicate heavily.
[02:15:58.520 --> 02:16:05.520]  Well, in this, you have to get into some of the requirements for actually growing quality medical marijuana here.
[02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:10.520]  Like six marijuana plants sounds like a lot of marijuana plants.
[02:16:10.520 --> 02:16:14.520]  Thirty marijuana plants sounds like a whole lot of marijuana plants.
[02:16:14.520 --> 02:16:17.520]  Earlier you guys were talking about phenotypes.
[02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:20.520]  Everybody's talking about different strains.
[02:16:20.520 --> 02:16:26.520]  When you're capped at 30 and you're trying to supply five different people,
[02:16:26.520 --> 02:16:31.520]  all of a sudden you're incredibly limited into what you can do, what you can work with.
[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:36.520]  And we wouldn't have CBD-only strains or Charlotte's Web or any of that
[02:16:36.520 --> 02:16:40.520]  without a dispensary system that was allowed to grow thousands of plants.
[02:16:40.520 --> 02:16:51.520]  In trying to care give, you almost have to do hundreds of plants over a couple of years to really get your patients figured out.
[02:16:51.520 --> 02:16:54.520]  There's something else I wanted to get in.
[02:16:54.520 --> 02:16:57.520]  Trying to do that 30 at a time is just crazy.
[02:16:57.520 --> 02:16:59.520]  I like to grow big plants.
[02:16:59.520 --> 02:17:03.520]  I like a seven-gallon pot filled with the soilless mix, a lot of perlite in there, a lot of ...
[02:17:03.520 --> 02:17:07.520]  I'm not even going to tell you too much of it, but I like a nice seven-gallon pot.
[02:17:07.520 --> 02:17:11.520]  I like to veg them until they're about three feet tall, three and a half feet tall.
[02:17:11.520 --> 02:17:13.520]  I like to flower them at that point.
[02:17:13.520 --> 02:17:15.520]  I'll top them once to where they're a nice bush.
[02:17:15.520 --> 02:17:17.520]  By the time they're done, they're about six feet tall.
[02:17:17.520 --> 02:17:22.520]  I like to grow a big plant, but if I grow my super silver haystream that I have in a pot that size ...
[02:17:22.520 --> 02:17:24.520]  Oh, excuse me, I'm burping.
[02:17:24.520 --> 02:17:26.520]  If I grow a super silver haystream that I have in a pot that size,
[02:17:26.520 --> 02:17:30.520]  it'll grow through the freaking ceiling in the 11 weeks that it takes to finish.
[02:17:30.520 --> 02:17:36.520]  I like to run more of those plants in smaller pots because it's more as a grower that's experienced.
[02:17:36.520 --> 02:17:40.520]  I know that's the most economical and efficient way to run with that strain.
[02:17:40.520 --> 02:17:46.520]  I have to time it because I have to count.
[02:17:46.520 --> 02:17:52.520]  I have so many numbers I can play with, and if I want to do super silver haze for my guy that wants a straight-up head race in sativa,
[02:17:52.520 --> 02:17:59.520]  I've got to plan nine of those instead of four, and that just messes up my plant count already just for strain adjustment.
[02:17:59.520 --> 02:18:05.520]  Changing our numbers is going to mess with us, and they're trying to stop us from being a lucrative enterprise.
[02:18:05.520 --> 02:18:11.520]  Right now, being a caregiver, it nearly costs me money to be a medical marijuana caregiver.
[02:18:11.520 --> 02:18:13.520]  I don't make any money doing it, certainly.
[02:18:13.520 --> 02:18:18.520]  There are light bills. I work. I spend a lot of time putting your guys' medicine together.
[02:18:18.520 --> 02:18:19.520]  It's not easy.
[02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:27.520]  If I was to order something that was 50% THC, 50% CBD, or whatever the profile is,
[02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:32.520]  how long from me going, I want this, to you being able to produce it?
[02:18:32.520 --> 02:18:35.520]  Do I have the strain that you want, or do I need to create that for you?
[02:18:35.520 --> 02:18:40.520]  No, I just showed up, and I'm a jerk. I've never mentioned it before, and I want it now.
[02:18:40.520 --> 02:18:46.520]  Breeding a strain is going to take me at least – well, to breed it the first time, I've got to get the male.
[02:18:46.520 --> 02:18:51.520]  I've got to get the female. If I've got the male and female that you're hoping, I have to have the male and female,
[02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:54.520]  and I have to get them both vegged big enough. I have to flower them out.
[02:18:54.520 --> 02:18:59.520]  The veg stage is probably two months. Flower stage is definitely two months, maybe two and a half to three,
[02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:01.520]  because you've got to time the male and the female.
[02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:04.520]  I'm at five months already. I'm going to kick out seeds. The plant's got to dry.
[02:19:04.520 --> 02:19:07.520]  I've got to pull the seeds out. You're looking at another couple of few weeks there.
[02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:10.520]  We're half a year just making the first batch of seeds.
[02:19:10.520 --> 02:19:16.520]  Now we have to run those and share those with other providers that can take a clone of that,
[02:19:16.520 --> 02:19:20.520]  so that if they find the champion that you're looking for, then I can get a clone of that.
[02:19:20.520 --> 02:19:26.520]  Then I need to breed that one to either the male or the female again, the male again to stabilize it.
[02:19:26.520 --> 02:19:29.520]  We're like year two now, right?
[02:19:29.520 --> 02:19:31.520]  Yeah, it's going to take us a little while. We'll have what you need at first,
[02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:36.520]  but if I want to get it in seed form that's solid for it to be out and available, we're looking at two, maybe three years.
[02:19:36.520 --> 02:19:43.520]  It'll be available to sample a little here and there, but before it can be something that you could keep available steady for.
[02:19:43.520 --> 02:19:45.520]  We're looking at three years.
[02:19:46.520 --> 02:19:49.520]  That's what the rules are now.
[02:19:49.520 --> 02:19:55.520]  If all of a sudden every caregiver in Colorado is limited to 30 or 36 plants,
[02:19:55.520 --> 02:20:00.520]  or some areas have hard limited people, period.
[02:20:00.520 --> 02:20:05.520]  If you're working in Denver City and County, you're limited to 12 plants per household, period.
[02:20:05.520 --> 02:20:08.520]  No exceptions.
[02:20:08.520 --> 02:20:11.520]  How many mother plants do some genetic companies have?
[02:20:11.520 --> 02:20:13.520]  Hundreds.
[02:20:13.520 --> 02:20:19.520]  I know that Archive, I can't quote, but I'm pretty sure Archive has about 18 to 25 mother plants, Archive Seed Bank.
[02:20:19.520 --> 02:20:21.520]  That would be way off then.
[02:20:21.520 --> 02:20:25.520]  I think Subcool probably has got 40.
[02:20:25.520 --> 02:20:27.520]  I was thinking strains, not mother plants.
[02:20:27.520 --> 02:20:31.520]  Oh yeah, mother plants. Just like one seed company, like one seed guy.
[02:20:31.520 --> 02:20:38.520]  The big guys like Swerves probably got, I'm just dropping names now, Swerves probably got 35 mother plants that he works with.
[02:20:38.520 --> 02:20:41.520]  He's got two males and he reverses shit.
[02:20:41.520 --> 02:20:46.520]  He'd have to keep 35 females just to have those for genetic supply.
[02:20:46.520 --> 02:20:50.520]  That's kind of off the, that's stretching it a little bit.
[02:20:50.520 --> 02:20:57.520]  This is where all those crazy names come from, is all the hard work that these people are doing, that we're describing right now.
[02:20:57.520 --> 02:21:01.520]  I'm going to read the summary of a caregiver bill that's written by my friend Kevin.
[02:21:01.520 --> 02:21:04.520]  Hey Kevin, I apologize. It's not the Kevin at the table, it's another Kevin.
[02:21:04.520 --> 02:21:09.520]  I don't know how to pronounce your last name and I feel it would be more polite just to straight up say I don't know how to pronounce that.
[02:21:09.520 --> 02:21:12.520]  I'd like to meet you in person, shake your hand, and have you tell me how to say this.
[02:21:12.520 --> 02:21:15.520]  Kevin is the political director for Pink House Blooms.
[02:21:15.520 --> 02:21:19.520]  He's a very educated and well-written, well-spoken young man.
[02:21:19.520 --> 02:21:25.520]  Here's what he has to say. I'm reading from my iPhone, so excuse me when I have to re-find my spot several times.
[02:21:25.520 --> 02:21:36.520]  The current debate focused around Colorado's marijuana caregivers is a result of a recent audit of the caregiver program by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and the Department of Revenue.
[02:21:36.520 --> 02:21:40.520]  Yeah, the Department of Revenue is attached to our marijuana system in Colorado.
[02:21:40.520 --> 02:21:41.520]  They keep good notes.
[02:21:41.520 --> 02:21:43.520]  They do keep very good notes.
[02:21:43.520 --> 02:21:49.520]  Throughout the process, there were several shortcomings in regard to the enforceability of the program and the overall implementation.
[02:21:50.520 --> 02:21:55.520]  Auditors discovered regulars were not sufficiently overseeing doctors who issued recommendations to patients.
[02:21:55.520 --> 02:21:59.520]  Caregivers were not given proper oversight from the health department.
[02:21:59.520 --> 02:22:06.520]  Officials failed to issue red cards within the constitutionally required 35-day timeline, which has been a problem since day one right there.
[02:22:06.520 --> 02:22:08.520]  They've never had that right.
[02:22:08.520 --> 02:22:10.520]  How is that the caregiver's fault?
[02:22:10.520 --> 02:22:13.520]  Well, this is what sparked it all.
[02:22:13.520 --> 02:22:17.520]  They audited because of this and then they realized all the stuff that's going on.
[02:22:17.520 --> 02:22:21.520]  I agree with part of it and I understand why.
[02:22:21.520 --> 02:22:24.520]  They're not getting their cards in the required time.
[02:22:24.520 --> 02:22:31.520]  They're also accused of the health department of charging too much inpatient application fees, which they have reduced to $15.
[02:22:31.520 --> 02:22:33.520]  It started off at $90. It went down to $35.
[02:22:33.520 --> 02:22:36.520]  They did something for indigent people and now it's $15.
[02:22:36.520 --> 02:22:44.520]  They've got an overgeneric count of $10 or $13 million or something like that in state law for bids, things like that.
[02:22:44.520 --> 02:22:50.520]  They've had to drop the fee over and over and over again because they can't take in any more money legally.
[02:22:50.520 --> 02:22:55.520]  Until they spend all the money they've already shaved out of the medical marijuana program.
[02:22:55.520 --> 02:22:57.520]  It's kind of handy.
[02:22:57.520 --> 02:23:00.520]  It's a nice little provision if you're a taxpayer for sure.
[02:23:00.520 --> 02:23:03.520]  Or a red card holder. I like that the fee got cheaper.
[02:23:03.520 --> 02:23:05.520]  Do you like that the fee got cheaper?
[02:23:05.520 --> 02:23:06.520]  I definitely appreciate that.
[02:23:06.520 --> 02:23:08.520]  Let's applaud the fee getting cheaper.
[02:23:09.520 --> 02:23:23.520]  The Department of Public Health and environment generally agreed with the recommendations from the auditor's report and are already taking steps to rectify the issues.
[02:23:23.520 --> 02:23:32.520]  They're considering redefining who is an authorized CDPHE employee, which could mean increased access to private medical marijuana records by independent contractors,
[02:23:32.520 --> 02:23:40.520]  limiting the number of patients that private medical marijuana caregivers can serve, as well as putting a cap on the number of plants an individual may grow.
[02:23:40.520 --> 02:23:42.520]  Did that make sense to you guys? I felt like I might have skipped something.
[02:23:42.520 --> 02:23:44.520]  No, that made sense to me.
[02:23:44.520 --> 02:23:49.520]  I know what all those words mean and there was a lot of industry lingo in there for the listeners.
[02:23:49.520 --> 02:23:50.520]  Yeah.
[02:23:50.520 --> 02:23:53.520]  Here's the sentence they should have caught.
[02:23:53.520 --> 02:24:00.520]  Limiting the number of patients that private medical marijuana caregivers can have, as well as putting a cap on the number of plants an individual may grow.
[02:24:01.520 --> 02:24:03.520]  Reiterating what I was saying.
[02:24:03.520 --> 02:24:05.520]  It's going to fuck things up.
[02:24:05.520 --> 02:24:06.520]  So I'm going to continue.
[02:24:06.520 --> 02:24:10.520]  Dr. Larry Wolk, W-O-L-K, of the Colorado Department of Public Health.
[02:24:10.520 --> 02:24:14.520]  I'm going to say CDPHE from now on to save us all a headache.
[02:24:14.520 --> 02:24:21.520]  So Larry Wolk with the CDPHE, along with the state legislators, are working to craft new laws clarifying their stance on caregivers and home growers.
[02:24:21.520 --> 02:24:29.520]  But House Speaker Mark F., who does not good with these names that are not English completely.
[02:24:29.520 --> 02:24:31.520]  So Mark, I'm not going to fuck up your name.
[02:24:31.520 --> 02:24:32.520]  I have respect for that.
[02:24:32.520 --> 02:24:39.520]  Mark, who decides which bills can be considered, said he won't allow a vote on the issue until medical marijuana caregivers and patients are consulted.
[02:24:39.520 --> 02:24:43.520]  Maybe they're going to kind of try to listen to us and we've already raised a stink here.
[02:24:43.520 --> 02:24:49.520]  They had one public hearing already and I know that a number of caregivers stood up and spoke.
[02:24:49.520 --> 02:24:53.520]  I know that a couple failed to put their best foot forward, which was unfortunate.
[02:24:54.520 --> 02:25:03.520]  But for the most part, they went and they said our piece and tried to explain to the legislature why limiting people in this way is a terrible idea.
[02:25:03.520 --> 02:25:08.520]  Anytime government is between a patient and a doctor, bad things tend to happen.
[02:25:08.520 --> 02:25:11.520]  And that's totally what's going on here.
[02:25:11.520 --> 02:25:13.520]  They want to tell you what your prescription should be.
[02:25:13.520 --> 02:25:21.520]  And because in Colorado we're not allowed to have prescriptions for medical marijuana, we have to have a recommendation and all sorts of other things.
[02:25:21.520 --> 02:25:28.520]  The legislature just realized that doctors haven't been giving out the minimum for everybody.
[02:25:28.520 --> 02:25:41.520]  For the 110,000 people in the program, doctors have actually been talking to the patients, asking them how much they consume, how often, and writing them a recommendation that's appropriate to that.
[02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:43.520]  And they freaked out.
[02:25:43.520 --> 02:25:48.520]  Now, there are one or two examples that they cite that are pretty egregious, I'd admit.
[02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:53.520]  The dude with the 501 plant count, that's…
[02:25:53.520 --> 02:25:58.520]  Yeah, since federal limits…any federal plant is illegal, federally.
[02:25:58.520 --> 02:26:01.520]  But they say they don't care if it's 99.
[02:26:01.520 --> 02:26:02.520]  Right.
[02:26:02.520 --> 02:26:03.520]  They do if it's 100.
[02:26:03.520 --> 02:26:06.520]  And one dude with a 500 plant count card, that's a lot of plants.
[02:26:06.520 --> 02:26:12.520]  Yeah, well, that's cool because that's like the guy when you're on the highway and there's that one guy in the yellow Camaro that goes hauling ass past you.
[02:26:12.520 --> 02:26:13.520]  And you go, enjoy that ticket.
[02:26:13.520 --> 02:26:17.520]  And you know you can just drive right by the cop because he's fucking with that other guy already.
[02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:20.520]  We'll just let that guy with the 500 plants race right by us.
[02:26:20.520 --> 02:26:26.520]  There's only 24 caregivers in the whole state, I think it said, that have more than five patients.
[02:26:26.520 --> 02:26:32.520]  So, they're making a huge stink out of a pretty small problem for the most part.
[02:26:32.520 --> 02:26:34.520]  You know what I mean?
[02:26:34.520 --> 02:26:35.520]  Yeah.
[02:26:35.520 --> 02:26:38.520]  Whether they're here to change the rules for everybody and screw up 12 years of good practice.
[02:26:38.520 --> 02:26:41.520]  We'll get in…we're going to talk about that in a minute here because that's…
[02:26:41.520 --> 02:26:42.520]  I'm jumping ahead.
[02:26:42.520 --> 02:26:45.520]  Well, no, that's just the part I want to rant about.
[02:26:45.520 --> 02:26:48.520]  That's the result and we got to save the result after we read.
[02:26:48.520 --> 02:26:51.520]  You know, you got to do all the math and then we'll summarize the results.
[02:26:51.520 --> 02:26:52.520]  So, I'm going to read a little more.
[02:26:52.520 --> 02:26:54.520]  There's one good paragraph.
[02:26:54.520 --> 02:26:58.520]  The caregiver issue has the marijuana community split down the middle.
[02:26:58.520 --> 02:27:04.520]  The industry, MMIG and CBA are both supporting the CDPHE's efforts while patients and patient advocacy groups,
[02:27:04.520 --> 02:27:08.520]  the patient advocacy groups, Patients Out of Time, Colorado Springs Medical Marijuana Council,
[02:27:08.520 --> 02:27:13.520]  Coloradans for Cannabis Patients' Rights and Green Faith Ministries make up the opposition.
[02:27:14.520 --> 02:27:19.520]  Many believe that groups such as MMIG and CBA are only supportive of tighter regulations because,
[02:27:19.520 --> 02:27:25.520]  and this is what I'm thinking, it will force patients into the regulated market and in return increase profits.
[02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:32.520]  Those that are opposing efforts cited doctor-patient relationships, privacy and compassion as areas of concern.
[02:27:32.520 --> 02:27:39.520]  So, what I think is going to happen here, if they will limit my number of plants, all caregivers, not just myself,
[02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:47.520]  they'll cut us down and it's going to make a short supply because there's already a short supply.
[02:27:47.520 --> 02:27:52.520]  The supply in Colorado, it was tight before.
[02:27:52.520 --> 02:27:53.520]  Well, I'm responding.
[02:27:53.520 --> 02:27:58.520]  Do you ever go anywhere else to get your medical marijuana other than your caregiver?
[02:27:58.520 --> 02:28:00.520]  Only when I'm stuck out of town.
[02:28:00.520 --> 02:28:02.520]  Right, right. If you're in Denver and you got carried away.
[02:28:02.520 --> 02:28:03.520]  If it's an emergency.
[02:28:03.520 --> 02:28:04.520]  Yeah, how about you, Kev?
[02:28:04.520 --> 02:28:08.520]  Sometimes, but I work at a medical marijuana dispensary.
[02:28:08.520 --> 02:28:10.520]  Yeah, and it never hurts my feet.
[02:28:10.520 --> 02:28:15.520]  I love it when you bring over some train wreck like you did today to smoke me out with. That was pretty tasty.
[02:28:15.520 --> 02:28:16.520]  That's always advantageous.
[02:28:16.520 --> 02:28:18.520]  Because that's my responsibility to know about what we have there.
[02:28:18.520 --> 02:28:19.520]  You've got to know, yeah.
[02:28:19.520 --> 02:28:21.520]  Not outside of market research, though.
[02:28:21.520 --> 02:28:27.520]  Right, but outside of my work, I don't unless I'm in Denver and I'm hitting the spot.
[02:28:27.520 --> 02:28:28.520]  Dispensary hopping because it's fun.
[02:28:28.520 --> 02:28:29.520]  Because I'm out of town.
[02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:33.520]  What I'm getting at is you guys don't need to go anywhere else because I do my best to even...
[02:28:33.520 --> 02:28:35.520]  He does his job very well.
[02:28:36.520 --> 02:28:42.520]  Sometimes I won't make dabs out of my personal supply so that I've got that extra little bit because I know you guys are going to...
[02:28:42.520 --> 02:28:43.520]  I've got you timed.
[02:28:43.520 --> 02:28:46.520]  He grows strains for us that we like that he doesn't.
[02:28:46.520 --> 02:28:48.520]  Did I say on the air or was this a private talk?
[02:28:48.520 --> 02:28:52.520]  I grow the torobora like a boss and I do not like growing the plant.
[02:28:52.520 --> 02:28:56.520]  Personally as a grower, as a cannabis photographer, I don't like growing torobora.
[02:28:56.520 --> 02:29:00.520]  It doesn't grow well for my growing style, my environment.
[02:29:00.520 --> 02:29:02.520]  It doesn't get along with the rest of my plants.
[02:29:02.520 --> 02:29:04.520]  It doesn't play the same, but these guys love it.
[02:29:04.520 --> 02:29:08.520]  The majority of his patients love it and so he keeps it around for us.
[02:29:08.520 --> 02:29:09.520]  It's so medicinal. It's wonderful.
[02:29:09.520 --> 02:29:10.520]  The pain just goes away.
[02:29:10.520 --> 02:29:13.520]  It harvests half as much as all of my heavy hitter citrus plants.
[02:29:13.520 --> 02:29:15.520]  There's a few strains that he does that with which is really awesome.
[02:29:15.520 --> 02:29:21.520]  He really gets our opinion, takes it to heart and runs with it.
[02:29:24.520 --> 02:29:28.520]  Like I've said before, my joy is watching people feel better.
[02:29:28.520 --> 02:29:31.520]  I've got a friend who's got a bad back.
[02:29:31.520 --> 02:29:32.520]  He's got some sciatica.
[02:29:32.520 --> 02:29:33.520]  His legs are fucked up.
[02:29:33.520 --> 02:29:34.520]  He was once with a cane.
[02:29:34.520 --> 02:29:39.520]  He showed up here in pain and we all hung out and I got him nice and heavily medicated.
[02:29:39.520 --> 02:29:42.520]  He stood up to leave and the old bastard forgot his cane.
[02:29:42.520 --> 02:29:43.520]  That's how good he felt.
[02:29:43.520 --> 02:29:45.520]  That's how good the man felt.
[02:29:45.520 --> 02:29:47.520]  That statement in itself is huge.
[02:29:47.520 --> 02:29:48.520]  Forgot his cane.
[02:29:48.520 --> 02:29:51.520]  I made that happen.
[02:29:51.520 --> 02:29:55.520]  I'm not trying to say it, but the feeling inside me was like, wow, he's walking upright.
[02:29:55.520 --> 02:29:56.520]  He forgot he hurts.
[02:29:56.520 --> 02:30:00.520]  He had a little bit of spiritual therapy from hanging out with all of us for an hour or whatever.
[02:30:00.520 --> 02:30:02.520]  That kind of stuff is priceless.
[02:30:02.520 --> 02:30:08.520]  When they limit my grow or other caregivers, this isn't going to hurt me too much, honestly.
[02:30:08.520 --> 02:30:14.520]  My problem is that I've got mother plants and I'm going to have to minimize mother plants to make this work or something else.
[02:30:14.520 --> 02:30:15.520]  I can adjust.
[02:30:15.520 --> 02:30:16.520]  I can roll with punches.
[02:30:16.520 --> 02:30:17.520]  That's what a grower does.
[02:30:17.520 --> 02:30:18.520]  That's what a breeder does.
[02:30:18.520 --> 02:30:21.520]  You fucking adapt, adjust, fucking move on.
[02:30:21.520 --> 02:30:24.520]  There are going to be people that are not as skilled.
[02:30:24.520 --> 02:30:25.520]  They're not as educated.
[02:30:25.520 --> 02:30:26.520]  They aren't as experienced.
[02:30:26.520 --> 02:30:29.520]  They're not going to be able to keep up their supply for their patients.
[02:30:29.520 --> 02:30:33.520]  What's going to happen is these people are going to have to go to a dispensary.
[02:30:33.520 --> 02:30:35.520]  But here's another fucked up issue.
[02:30:35.520 --> 02:30:42.520]  The medical marijuana dispensaries are running out of medical cannabis while the recreational dispensaries are well stocked.
[02:30:42.520 --> 02:30:44.520]  I find that fucked up.
[02:30:44.520 --> 02:30:45.520]  More hugely.
[02:30:45.520 --> 02:30:48.520]  Mike, you're going to have to go.
[02:30:48.520 --> 02:30:51.520]  I'm out of weed because they limited my numbers.
[02:30:51.520 --> 02:30:52.520]  I can't grow.
[02:30:52.520 --> 02:30:57.520]  I don't have your ounce for this whatever time period that we hypothetically, but I'm not going to go to weights and numbers.
[02:30:57.520 --> 02:30:59.520]  Thank you for not disclosing medical information.
[02:30:59.520 --> 02:31:00.520]  Right.
[02:31:00.520 --> 02:31:04.520]  Your monthly prescription, sorry, it's half short because of these new regulations.
[02:31:04.520 --> 02:31:06.520]  I haven't adjusted my grow to that yet.
[02:31:06.520 --> 02:31:09.520]  You're going to have to go to the dispensary to get a half a month supply.
[02:31:09.520 --> 02:31:12.520]  The real world implications of that on my world are huge.
[02:31:12.520 --> 02:31:13.520]  Yeah.
[02:31:13.520 --> 02:31:15.520]  Financially, you're going to be hurt.
[02:31:15.520 --> 02:31:20.520]  The cost increases, I almost don't want to say because you could kind of look it up if you really do your homework.
[02:31:20.520 --> 02:31:21.520]  Fuck it, do your homework people.
[02:31:21.520 --> 02:31:24.520]  This will give you an example of how jealous you should be.
[02:31:24.520 --> 02:31:31.520]  I would pay at least twice as much if I had to fill my prescription at a retail.
[02:31:31.520 --> 02:31:32.520]  At a medical.
[02:31:32.520 --> 02:31:34.520]  You would pay twice as much at a medical shop.
[02:31:34.520 --> 02:31:35.520]  At a medical shop.
[02:31:35.520 --> 02:31:36.520]  Because of the taxes.
[02:31:36.520 --> 02:31:38.520]  Almost three times at a retail.
[02:31:38.520 --> 02:31:39.520]  Three times at a retail shop.
[02:31:39.520 --> 02:31:40.520]  At a recreational shop.
[02:31:40.520 --> 02:31:47.520]  What I'm getting at is the medical shops are out of weed and that's where the medical, most of the stuff that's there is tested.
[02:31:47.520 --> 02:31:48.520]  They're a little ahead of that.
[02:31:48.520 --> 02:31:50.520]  Everything's going to have to be tested here real soon.
[02:31:50.520 --> 02:31:51.520]  Come July.
[02:31:51.520 --> 02:31:54.520]  No, there's for sure a reason those stores charge with the charge.
[02:31:54.520 --> 02:31:58.520]  But I provide you a strain specific product that you have gotten to look at.
[02:31:58.520 --> 02:31:59.520]  You've gotten to trim with me.
[02:31:59.520 --> 02:32:01.520]  You've experienced that plenty.
[02:32:01.520 --> 02:32:05.520]  I think part of you touching your medicine, you guys have been involved.
[02:32:05.520 --> 02:32:06.520]  Being able to see it all the way through is amazing.
[02:32:06.520 --> 02:32:07.520]  It makes it better.
[02:32:07.520 --> 02:32:09.520]  You are connected to that as you consume it.
[02:32:09.520 --> 02:32:15.520]  I'm a Rastafarian and I feel that that touch, that connection makes the medicine work better for you.
[02:32:15.520 --> 02:32:16.520]  You're involved with it.
[02:32:16.520 --> 02:32:24.520]  I'm certain that's one of the reasons that when I make concentrates from your material, it's the most fun and I get the best concentrates out of it.
[02:32:24.520 --> 02:32:29.520]  The whole process is just really awesome to me.
[02:32:29.520 --> 02:32:34.520]  Not that it isn't always, but with your material, there's an extra level to that for me.
[02:32:34.520 --> 02:32:35.520]  I think that's part of it.
[02:32:35.520 --> 02:32:42.520]  Being able to watch these plants grow and being so close to you and the plants and stuff, it makes it way more.
[02:32:42.520 --> 02:32:45.520]  When you guys ask me, how is the Lemon Jeffrey doing?
[02:32:45.520 --> 02:32:47.520]  I'm like, it's week seven, come look.
[02:32:47.520 --> 02:32:49.520]  Wash your hands, come take a look.
[02:32:49.520 --> 02:32:55.520]  I came over what, half a dozen times watching the last batch of Grateful Dog come up.
[02:32:55.520 --> 02:33:00.520]  I know you don't have any, can I just come stare at it for like 40 minutes?
[02:33:00.520 --> 02:33:02.520]  Sure, come on over.
[02:33:02.520 --> 02:33:10.520]  I've learned to eliminate a lot of these sprays and things that I don't think I would want to consume in my hash.
[02:33:10.520 --> 02:33:14.520]  If I wouldn't mist it into the air and let it land on my hash, I'm trying to get it out of my grow room.
[02:33:15.520 --> 02:33:19.520]  I am seeing more and more companies, more grows.
[02:33:19.520 --> 02:33:26.520]  I am privileged, I get to go into grow rooms and I get to see things that fucking civilians would shit their pants over, dude.
[02:33:26.520 --> 02:33:33.520]  But I see floramite in a quart or pint container in professional grow rooms.
[02:33:37.520 --> 02:33:38.520]  Floramite is terrible.
[02:33:38.520 --> 02:33:42.520]  If you spray floramite, I guess any time is what I'm learning.
[02:33:42.520 --> 02:33:45.520]  Even in veg now, it's going to still remain in your flowers.
[02:33:45.520 --> 02:33:47.520]  At harvest, after flush, it'll be there.
[02:33:47.520 --> 02:33:54.520]  You're going to be dabbing it most likely if you're a future kid and you're dabbing neurotoxins on a daily basis.
[02:33:54.520 --> 02:34:00.520]  None of this testing stuff we're talking about would be available without legalization.
[02:34:00.520 --> 02:34:02.520]  These guys know I'm not floramite dabbing them.
[02:34:02.520 --> 02:34:07.520]  I've been watching you learn and whatnot since pretty much the beginning, right?
[02:34:07.520 --> 02:34:11.520]  Mike, remember the time that I saw, I fucked up one time really badly.
[02:34:11.520 --> 02:34:18.520]  It was the middle of winter and my gear, it had switched from the, in Colorado we get a heavy switch from fall or summer, fall, winter.
[02:34:18.520 --> 02:34:20.520]  It just goes boom, it's about a week.
[02:34:20.520 --> 02:34:26.520]  You'll be wearing shorts and a t-shirt and then you're in fucking Eskimo boots and a snow hat freezing your dick off.
[02:34:26.520 --> 02:34:33.520]  And at that time period, I got powdery mildew from not adjusting and adapting to the rooms because I wasn't experienced in Colorado to grow yet.
[02:34:34.520 --> 02:34:42.520]  I got a four to five ounce white rhino plant that had powdery mildew up the one side that was facing the wall because the wall radiated cold and it made it.
[02:34:42.520 --> 02:34:43.520]  I'm sure that time was up.
[02:34:43.520 --> 02:34:48.520]  It was an amateur mistake, but your answer to it, I totally remember this night.
[02:34:48.520 --> 02:34:59.520]  Is it's one of the reasons that I stopped really shopping anywhere else because I knew that whatever was coming from your garden had this step in it.
[02:34:59.520 --> 02:35:08.520]  And I watched him take a set of shears, cut the plant out of its pot and stuff it right in a big black trash bag and haul it out of the house immediately.
[02:35:08.520 --> 02:35:09.520]  Yeah.
[02:35:09.520 --> 02:35:11.520]  And it was a four or five ounce plant.
[02:35:11.520 --> 02:35:16.520]  We had just trimmed two identical to it that were perfectly healthy.
[02:35:16.520 --> 02:35:23.520]  And that third one right into the trash, just no question, no thought to loss or any of that.
[02:35:23.520 --> 02:35:28.520]  And I have watched other growers cut mold and things out of plants and sell the rest.
[02:35:28.520 --> 02:35:29.520]  Yeah.
[02:35:29.520 --> 02:35:30.520]  Yeah.
[02:35:30.520 --> 02:35:33.520]  I'm a medical marijuana caregiver and I love the guys that I'm helping out.
[02:35:33.520 --> 02:35:34.520]  I really do.
[02:35:34.520 --> 02:35:35.520]  I got a big heart.
[02:35:35.520 --> 02:35:37.520]  I like to think for being such a big dude, I got a big heart.
[02:35:37.520 --> 02:35:53.520]  If I would have given the old man I talked about earlier that has a cane or my friend Doug that you guys know, or even you guys, if I would have given you moldy weed with powdery mildew in it and in your future, any of you get some sort of lung infection, I will think that was my fault and I'll feel like shit forever for it.
[02:35:53.520 --> 02:35:54.520]  Right.
[02:35:54.520 --> 02:35:55.520]  That's not my job.
[02:35:55.520 --> 02:35:56.520]  My job is to keep you better.
[02:35:56.520 --> 02:35:57.520]  Yeah.
[02:35:57.520 --> 02:35:58.520]  Keep all that shit out of your plants, please.
[02:35:58.520 --> 02:36:02.520]  Because for us extract artists, it can be nightmare on equipment.
[02:36:02.520 --> 02:36:05.520]  It can be nightmare in the extracts first and foremost.
[02:36:05.520 --> 02:36:13.520]  No, no, no sprays, no fucking mildew, no molds, none of that.
[02:36:13.520 --> 02:36:16.520]  I've heard a lot of people recently saying, oh, that's okay.
[02:36:16.520 --> 02:36:18.520]  Just use it and just please don't throw it away.
[02:36:18.520 --> 02:36:19.520]  That's not worth it.
[02:36:19.520 --> 02:36:24.520]  I've heard people tell me that the only thing you can do with moldy pot is blast it.
[02:36:25.520 --> 02:36:26.520]  Yeah, that's what I've heard too.
[02:36:26.520 --> 02:36:28.520]  The only thing you can do is throw it away.
[02:36:28.520 --> 02:36:32.520]  I just, I throw up a little in my mouth when people say stuff like that.
[02:36:32.520 --> 02:36:38.520]  I heard someone say, I heard someone say the other day, well it kills it.
[02:36:38.520 --> 02:36:40.520]  It's like, dude, it concentrates it.
[02:36:40.520 --> 02:36:42.520]  That's what you're doing.
[02:36:42.520 --> 02:36:43.520]  You're making it concentrate.
[02:36:43.520 --> 02:36:44.520]  Exactly.
[02:36:44.520 --> 02:36:47.520]  Any of the pesticides, any of that nasty formite stuff.
[02:36:47.520 --> 02:36:49.520]  Just don't even do it.
[02:36:49.520 --> 02:36:50.520]  No, don't.
[02:36:50.520 --> 02:36:54.520]  That's why I say the coolest thing to come with legalization is lab testing.
[02:36:54.520 --> 02:36:58.520]  Lab testing has provided us so much.
[02:36:58.520 --> 02:37:10.520]  All of the worst parts of, the only real dangers really of buying pot in the 90s was it might be moldy or it might have powdery mildew in it.
[02:37:10.520 --> 02:37:13.520]  Or God only knows what they sprayed on it to get their crop to harvest.
[02:37:13.520 --> 02:37:15.520]  And now it's labeled.
[02:37:15.520 --> 02:37:16.520]  I know it's tested.
[02:37:16.520 --> 02:37:19.520]  Never tasted spider mites or spider mite eggs or think that you're moldy.
[02:37:19.520 --> 02:37:20.520]  Yep.
[02:37:20.520 --> 02:37:30.520]  Everybody had their little, their old wives tale, old hippie tales about if it pops or if it sparkles or if it crackles or if it burns black or.
[02:37:30.520 --> 02:37:32.520]  Oh, no.
[02:37:32.520 --> 02:37:33.520]  Yuck.
[02:37:33.520 --> 02:37:35.520]  God, I don't miss those days at all.
[02:37:35.520 --> 02:37:36.520]  Yeah, for sure.
[02:37:36.520 --> 02:37:38.520]  Much respect to all the pioneers and the revolutionaries.
[02:37:38.520 --> 02:37:42.520]  Hey, if you guys are here, my homie TaskRock said if you're here, it's likely you're a pioneer.
[02:37:42.520 --> 02:37:44.520]  This is stage two of that.
[02:37:44.520 --> 02:37:45.520]  You guys are jumping into phase two.
[02:37:45.520 --> 02:37:46.520]  Yeah.
[02:37:46.520 --> 02:37:50.520]  Phase one was, well, I'm going to say we're phase two.
[02:37:50.520 --> 02:37:53.520]  Task and Hellstone crew was phase one.
[02:37:53.520 --> 02:37:54.520]  We came in at phase two.
[02:37:54.520 --> 02:37:55.520]  Now you guys are phase three of the team.
[02:37:55.520 --> 02:37:58.520]  If you're a fan, then it's likely you're a pioneer.
[02:37:58.520 --> 02:38:00.520]  You could look back on this day and say I was here.
[02:38:00.520 --> 02:38:01.520]  Yes, sir.
[02:38:01.520 --> 02:38:02.520]  Shout out, TaskRock.
[02:38:02.520 --> 02:38:03.520]  I love you, bro.
[02:38:03.520 --> 02:38:05.520]  I feel like we've been talking about me growing a lot.
[02:38:05.520 --> 02:38:06.520]  That's kind of weird.
[02:38:06.520 --> 02:38:07.520]  I want to say that.
[02:38:07.520 --> 02:38:13.520]  Well, I mean, the stuff they're talking about in the legislature right now screws with us on a personal level every day.
[02:38:13.520 --> 02:38:14.520]  Yeah, it really does.
[02:38:14.520 --> 02:38:20.520]  I mean, think about the medications you take on a daily basis or your diet.
[02:38:20.520 --> 02:38:22.520]  We've got a bunch of Mountain Dew sitting on the table.
[02:38:22.520 --> 02:38:23.520]  Shout out to them.
[02:38:23.520 --> 02:38:24.520]  I do not.
[02:38:24.520 --> 02:38:27.520]  I want to mention that I have really quit drinking Mountain Dew and I'm effing proud of myself.
[02:38:27.520 --> 02:38:28.520]  I had a bad addiction.
[02:38:28.520 --> 02:38:31.520]  I'm fairly impressed as well as a serious Mountain Dew addict.
[02:38:32.520 --> 02:38:43.520]  But think about some idiot in Congress toying with your drug regimen every day on a personal medication level.
[02:38:43.520 --> 02:38:55.520]  What if your Xanax prescription was about to go from three pills a day to one because somebody in Congress just realized that doctors weren't giving out the bare minimum regardless of what the patient feedback was?
[02:38:55.520 --> 02:38:58.520]  What if I told you you can only take your birth control pill on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday?
[02:38:58.520 --> 02:38:59.520]  Good luck.
[02:38:59.520 --> 02:39:00.520]  Right?
[02:39:00.520 --> 02:39:03.520]  How many different medications?
[02:39:03.520 --> 02:39:04.520]  I'm sorry.
[02:39:04.520 --> 02:39:13.520]  Your Prozac's just two a day now because the legislature really doesn't think you should be taking four a day regardless of how much your body actually needs.
[02:39:13.520 --> 02:39:15.520]  Or what your doctor has figured out for you.
[02:39:15.520 --> 02:39:16.520]  It's crazy.
[02:39:16.520 --> 02:39:22.520]  And I actually use marijuana for medical purposes.
[02:39:22.520 --> 02:39:23.520]  I was injured.
[02:39:23.520 --> 02:39:26.520]  I have nerve-generated pain.
[02:39:26.520 --> 02:39:28.520]  You can Google this.
[02:39:28.520 --> 02:39:32.520]  We don't have a pill that works great on nerve-generated pain.
[02:39:32.520 --> 02:39:41.520]  I can swallow a Vicodin and I did for a number of weeks after I got hurt and my arm still felt like it was stuck in a car door.
[02:39:41.520 --> 02:39:46.520]  I'm going to do a Jack the Ripper dab with one of these Sweet Stone candies in my mouth and I can imagine it's going to be fucking delicious.
[02:39:46.520 --> 02:39:47.520]  We're going to do it.
[02:39:47.520 --> 02:39:48.520]  We're going to do it.
[02:39:48.520 --> 02:39:49.520]  Keep talking for a minute.
[02:39:49.520 --> 02:39:50.520]  Why don't you guys talk while I take a nap?
[02:39:51.520 --> 02:39:58.520]  Me along with a whole bunch of people in Colorado tried marijuana as a medicine for a medical effect.
[02:39:58.520 --> 02:40:03.520]  I just pictured you and a bunch of people sitting down at the base of Buttermilk Mountain just lined up.
[02:40:03.520 --> 02:40:07.520]  We all got together and we're like, alright, everybody don't take your pain medication today.
[02:40:07.520 --> 02:40:09.520]  We're all going to go do dabs.
[02:40:09.520 --> 02:40:11.520]  Try that for a day.
[02:40:11.520 --> 02:40:13.520]  But that's essentially what we did.
[02:40:14.520 --> 02:40:21.520]  I stopped taking pills for a day and just smoked a little bit of pot in the morning and went about my day off.
[02:40:21.520 --> 02:40:23.520]  Smoked a lot of pot in the afternoon.
[02:40:23.520 --> 02:40:28.520]  And as the day went on and I started to hurt more, I'd smoke a little more and the pain would fade right away.
[02:40:28.520 --> 02:40:32.520]  Right now I'm pain-free and I was hurt when I got here a few hours ago.
[02:40:32.520 --> 02:40:36.520]  I'll be a little sore again when I leave so that I can drive safely home.
[02:40:36.520 --> 02:40:39.520]  Back to the blood testing you're going to submit yourself to.
[02:40:39.520 --> 02:40:41.520]  I can't wait until that happens on a legit level.
[02:40:41.520 --> 02:40:46.520]  I'm slightly afraid of needles, but I've got tattoos and I've donated plasma so I think I can handle it.
[02:40:46.520 --> 02:40:48.520]  Make them write you a note for the track marks.
[02:40:48.520 --> 02:40:49.520]  Right.
[02:40:49.520 --> 02:40:55.520]  So one thing I want to mention before we quit ranting about me and growing and I want to get on to the next subject here.
[02:40:55.520 --> 02:41:02.520]  I think a lot of the places that people get problems from their plants, their bugs often come from clones.
[02:41:02.520 --> 02:41:05.520]  You're bringing in bugs when you bring in clones from other people.
[02:41:05.520 --> 02:41:09.520]  It's awesome to trade clones, but be careful, dude.
[02:41:09.520 --> 02:41:10.520]  Be careful.
[02:41:11.520 --> 02:41:17.520]  Inspect that shit the best that you can and have some sort of organic regimen to get rid of those spider mites.
[02:41:17.520 --> 02:41:19.520]  Quarantine that plant.
[02:41:19.520 --> 02:41:22.520]  Spider mites are the most common and also one of the most fucking pesky.
[02:41:23.520 --> 02:41:34.520]  That's why seed is so awesome and why plant count limits of 3 and 6 and 30 are so restrictive is because I've got to order 10 seeds.
[02:41:34.520 --> 02:41:35.520]  I like going through seed.
[02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:39.520]  You've got to pop all 10 of them and there's a third of what you're allowed to have.
[02:41:39.520 --> 02:41:42.520]  Yeah, and then you've got to take clones of them.
[02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:51.520]  Right from those 10 seeds you might get one or two that you keep, but until you figure that out you've got 10 and you've got to check off after you count.
[02:41:52.520 --> 02:41:58.520]  Sorry not to stick on this one topic, but it's one I've been watching all week and it just strikes a nerve.
[02:41:58.520 --> 02:41:59.520]  We can tell.
[02:41:59.520 --> 02:42:00.520]  We can tell. That's good.
[02:42:00.520 --> 02:42:05.520]  Excuse my cough. I'm looking for an article I've got saved here.
[02:42:05.520 --> 02:42:06.520]  What are you reaching for bro?
[02:42:06.520 --> 02:42:08.520]  Do the thing with my headphone jack again.
[02:42:08.520 --> 02:42:10.520]  Tap him. Make him get live again.
[02:42:10.520 --> 02:42:11.520]  Perfect.
[02:42:12.520 --> 02:42:22.520]  It's slowly rotating and when it's not in the sweet spot the sound bounces from right to left in my headphones and it's disorienting.
[02:42:22.520 --> 02:42:24.520]  It's hard to explain exactly how.
[02:42:25.520 --> 02:42:27.520]  This has been our longest episode so far. I'm kind of proud of us.
[02:42:27.520 --> 02:42:28.520]  We're doing well.
[02:42:28.520 --> 02:42:30.520]  Yeah, lots of talking. It feels good.
[02:42:30.520 --> 02:42:34.520]  So every episode I tried to do a segment that I call Give Thanks.
[02:42:34.520 --> 02:42:37.520]  This is our second installment of Give Thanks.
[02:42:37.520 --> 02:42:39.520]  That was cool. I pulled the word installment right out of my ass.
[02:42:39.520 --> 02:42:42.520]  I hope somebody saw that. It flew out like a big purple unicorn.
[02:42:45.520 --> 02:42:47.520]  You do not need to visualize that.
[02:42:47.520 --> 02:42:49.520]  Big purple unicorn coming out of the horn got me good.
[02:42:49.520 --> 02:42:55.520]  So I'm going to get serious now and pay respects and give thanks to everybody's favorite, Jack Herrera.
[02:42:56.520 --> 02:42:59.520]  I think it's Herrera. I better not say Herrera.
[02:42:59.520 --> 02:43:01.520]  We got to say Herrera.
[02:43:01.520 --> 02:43:04.520]  Everybody pronounces it differently. I don't even attempt it.
[02:43:04.520 --> 02:43:11.520]  I used to think it was short for Herrera. It was from the same offshoot because where we're from that's a popular name.
[02:43:11.520 --> 02:43:14.520]  It's not that. So it's Herrera and not Herrera.
[02:43:14.520 --> 02:43:17.520]  So we're going to try to say it right. I got to retrain my brain. I apologize.
[02:43:17.520 --> 02:43:19.520]  I just took a dab. That's my excuse.
[02:43:19.520 --> 02:43:21.520]  So Jack Herrera, I want to give you thanks.
[02:43:21.520 --> 02:43:23.520]  You're crucial to the cannabis movement.
[02:43:23.520 --> 02:43:26.520]  I'm going to read a little bit about him. This is mostly from Wikipedia.
[02:43:26.520 --> 02:43:29.520]  Jack Herrera was born in June 18th of 1939.
[02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:32.520]  Sometimes called the Emperor of Hemp.
[02:43:32.520 --> 02:43:37.520]  Jack Herrera was an American cannabis activist and the author of The Emperor Wears No Clothes.
[02:43:37.520 --> 02:43:40.520]  A book still worth buying and reading, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:43:40.520 --> 02:43:42.520]  Have one at work signed.
[02:43:42.520 --> 02:43:45.520]  Nice. And this book, why is it worth buying and reading?
[02:43:45.520 --> 02:43:47.520]  You guys want to elaborate on that for me for a minute?
[02:43:47.520 --> 02:43:48.520]  Go ahead.
[02:43:48.520 --> 02:43:49.520]  I talk a lot.
[02:43:50.520 --> 02:43:55.520]  It's a fantastic history of hemp in the U.S. and across the world.
[02:43:55.520 --> 02:43:56.520]  And you should read it.
[02:43:56.520 --> 02:43:57.520]  There we go.
[02:43:57.520 --> 02:43:58.520]  It's the short version.
[02:43:58.520 --> 02:44:02.520]  And it's used to back up the legalized cannabis talks.
[02:44:02.520 --> 02:44:05.520]  It's got a lot of reasons, like useful stuff.
[02:44:05.520 --> 02:44:08.520]  It's got things in the front that I don't remember.
[02:44:08.520 --> 02:44:10.520]  It's been 15 years since I've read this book.
[02:44:10.520 --> 02:44:12.520]  Now I feel bad for not being prepared.
[02:44:12.520 --> 02:44:17.520]  But it's essentially a challenge for an insane amount of money that if you can disprove anything in this book,
[02:44:17.520 --> 02:44:19.520]  I will give you a huge amount of money.
[02:44:19.520 --> 02:44:21.520]  And no one ever attempted to claim it.
[02:44:21.520 --> 02:44:23.520]  Because you can't disprove anything he says.
[02:44:23.520 --> 02:44:31.520]  And it's really the pioneer book about cannabis and all of the medical and industrial uses
[02:44:31.520 --> 02:44:36.520]  in a time when knowing a bunch about marijuana was a criminal offense, essentially.
[02:44:38.520 --> 02:44:41.520]  Sounds good. I like your, you know some shit, bro.
[02:44:41.520 --> 02:44:44.520]  Right? That rattled out of a really high me.
[02:44:44.520 --> 02:44:46.520]  I saw your eyes roll back in your head and you just started going.
[02:44:46.520 --> 02:44:49.520]  I had to dig through a hash ball to get it, but I got it there.
[02:44:49.520 --> 02:44:51.520]  Jack wrote two books.
[02:44:51.520 --> 02:44:54.520]  He wrote, of course, The Emperor Wears No Clothes, which we've been ranting about.
[02:44:54.520 --> 02:44:56.520]  And also a book called Grass.
[02:44:56.520 --> 02:45:00.520]  There's also a documentary about him called The Emperor of Hemp.
[02:45:00.520 --> 02:45:06.520]  Jack believed, Jack Herrer believed, that the cannabis plant should be criminalized
[02:45:06.520 --> 02:45:09.520]  because, sorry I got the sweet stone in my mouth, I had to move it out of the way.
[02:45:09.520 --> 02:45:10.520]  He believed the cannabis plant.
[02:45:10.520 --> 02:45:13.520]  There's like five or six little ones in this package.
[02:45:13.520 --> 02:45:16.520]  I'm just savoring every fucking lick of that thing.
[02:45:16.520 --> 02:45:23.520]  He felt the cannabis plant should be decriminalized because it has been shown to be a renewable source of fuel, food, and medicine
[02:45:23.520 --> 02:45:26.520]  that can be grown in virtually any part of the world.
[02:45:26.520 --> 02:45:30.520]  He further asserts that the US government deliberately hides his proof.
[02:45:30.520 --> 02:45:32.520]  There is a strain of Jack Herrer.
[02:45:32.520 --> 02:45:33.520]  Wikipedia mentions that.
[02:45:33.520 --> 02:45:35.520]  Herrer. I did it again.
[02:45:35.520 --> 02:45:39.520]  But I should mention that that strain was absolutely not his favorite.
[02:45:39.520 --> 02:45:42.520]  He wasn't even very fond of it, which is kind of ironic in my opinion.
[02:45:42.520 --> 02:45:50.520]  Like most strains named after people, the people they're named after never interact with the person attempting to honor them in any way.
[02:45:50.520 --> 02:45:51.520]  So you get that a lot.
[02:45:51.520 --> 02:45:53.520]  Loud Seeds and Ganja Farmer OG, big up.
[02:45:53.520 --> 02:45:54.520]  Give them a shout out.
[02:45:54.520 --> 02:45:55.520]  They actually collaborated.
[02:45:55.520 --> 02:45:56.520]  They got the Ganja Farmer OG.
[02:45:56.520 --> 02:45:57.520]  That's kind of neat.
[02:45:57.520 --> 02:45:58.520]  I was waiting for that.
[02:45:58.520 --> 02:45:59.520]  I'm impressed.
[02:45:59.520 --> 02:46:00.520]  That's pretty intense.
[02:46:00.520 --> 02:46:01.520]  I'm impressed.
[02:46:01.520 --> 02:46:04.520]  It does not surprise me that you know the example that breaks the rule.
[02:46:04.520 --> 02:46:07.520]  Yeah, well that's too, that Loud is a great breeding company.
[02:46:07.520 --> 02:46:09.520]  And they were all over the Cannabis Cup last year.
[02:46:09.520 --> 02:46:11.520]  Everywhere you looked it was Loud, Loud, Loud.
[02:46:11.520 --> 02:46:15.520]  And Marlon Asher is a reggae artist that sings Ganja Farmer, so of course I'm going to know that.
[02:46:15.520 --> 02:46:16.520]  Nice.
[02:46:16.520 --> 02:46:17.520]  Of course.
[02:46:17.520 --> 02:46:24.520]  Did you guys know that Herrer ran for the United States President twice in 1998 and 1992 as a grassroots party candidate?
[02:46:24.520 --> 02:46:25.520]  I did not know that.
[02:46:25.520 --> 02:46:29.520]  I could not have told you the years, but I knew that that was one of the stunts that he pulled.
[02:46:29.520 --> 02:46:37.520]  Unfortunately in July of 2000 he suffered a minor heart attack and a major stroke resulting in difficulty speaking and moving the right side of his body.
[02:46:37.520 --> 02:46:44.520]  He mostly recovered, but on September 12, 2009 he suffered another heart attack while backstage at the Hempstock Festival in Portland, Oregon.
[02:46:44.520 --> 02:46:48.520]  He spent a month in critical condition in a Portland hospital.
[02:46:48.520 --> 02:46:52.520]  In a medically induced coma he was discharged to another facility.
[02:46:52.520 --> 02:47:03.520]  Paul Stanford of the Hemp and Cannabis Foundation said that he's waking up and gazing appropriately when someone is talking, but he's not really communicating in any way.
[02:47:04.520 --> 02:47:14.520]  Unfortunately he passed away at the age of 70 on April 15, 2010 in Eugene, Oregon from complications related to the September 2009 heart attack.
[02:47:14.520 --> 02:47:18.520]  He was buried in Mission Hills, California.
[02:47:18.520 --> 02:47:20.520]  One more little piece of info.
[02:47:20.520 --> 02:47:31.520]  On August 12, 2012 a video was released, uploaded to YouTube of a man named Rick Simpson claiming that Jack passed the torch of legislation.
[02:47:31.520 --> 02:47:34.520]  This sweet stone has got my mouth all delicious.
[02:47:34.520 --> 02:47:36.520]  Fucking buy him.
[02:47:36.520 --> 02:47:40.520]  Rick Simpson claims that Jack passed the torch of legislation to him.
[02:47:40.520 --> 02:47:45.520]  So big up. We thank you for your life's work Jack Herrer.
[02:47:45.520 --> 02:47:46.520]  Thank you sir.
[02:47:46.520 --> 02:47:47.520]  Respect.
[02:47:47.520 --> 02:47:48.520]  For sure.
[02:47:48.520 --> 02:47:50.520]  Respect.
[02:47:50.520 --> 02:47:51.520]  Man I want to mention one funny thing.
[02:47:51.520 --> 02:47:53.520]  There's a guy named Jeff McElroy.
[02:47:53.520 --> 02:47:56.520]  He is running for the mayor of Toronto, Canada.
[02:47:56.520 --> 02:47:59.520]  This is not an endorsement in any way.
[02:47:59.520 --> 02:48:00.520]  Not an endorsement.
[02:48:00.520 --> 02:48:02.520]  That's just how this story starts.
[02:48:02.520 --> 02:48:14.520]  His campaign sign, he's got these big, they're 6 feet wide and I think they're 6 feet tall, but they're like a plywood sheet so it's only, like it's got posts so it's only half of the width that it is wide.
[02:48:14.520 --> 02:48:16.520]  It's a pretty burly campaign sign.
[02:48:16.520 --> 02:48:17.520]  Yeah.
[02:48:17.520 --> 02:48:19.520]  It's not the little plastic one on the wires.
[02:48:19.520 --> 02:48:21.520]  No, no it's as wide as your car.
[02:48:21.520 --> 02:48:22.520]  It's the big burly car one.
[02:48:23.520 --> 02:48:28.520]  But this sign, the sign reads Jeff McElroy, he promises to just smoke pot as mayor, not crack.
[02:48:28.520 --> 02:48:30.520]  Anyone's better than Rob Ford.
[02:48:30.520 --> 02:48:32.520]  And if you get that, you get that.
[02:48:32.520 --> 02:48:33.520]  That's fucking funny.
[02:48:33.520 --> 02:48:40.520]  I love that Rob Ford's approval ratings have gone up or remained steady since the scandal broke.
[02:48:40.520 --> 02:48:49.520]  It turns out in Canada no one really cares what you smoke as long as you don't screw with them too much from a government standpoint.
[02:48:49.520 --> 02:48:53.520]  One more piece of information that I feel like we should share with the world.
[02:48:53.520 --> 02:48:55.520]  We're a company from Colorado.
[02:48:55.520 --> 02:48:56.520]  We talk about that a lot.
[02:48:56.520 --> 02:48:57.520]  I love Colorado.
[02:48:57.520 --> 02:48:59.520]  It's got medical and recreational marijuana here.
[02:48:59.520 --> 02:49:00.520]  I never want to leave, ever.
[02:49:00.520 --> 02:49:02.520]  Well, we got to go some places sometimes.
[02:49:02.520 --> 02:49:04.520]  You can't make me.
[02:49:04.520 --> 02:49:07.520]  Alright, the look on your face is pretty serious.
[02:49:07.520 --> 02:49:15.520]  I had this conversation yesterday with the wife and I really don't want to leave without some serious, serious tempting.
[02:49:15.520 --> 02:49:17.520]  Like it's got to be a pretty happy order.
[02:49:17.520 --> 02:49:19.520]  Anyway, go on with what you're saying.
[02:49:19.520 --> 02:49:32.520]  If you're driving this man, several people apparently have reported that they were in Idaho driving with Colorado license plates and they are harassed by the police, pulled over and the cops harass them about marijuana.
[02:49:32.520 --> 02:49:38.520]  Like they're driving cool, but they and this is allegedly I'm not in anybody's shoes here.
[02:49:38.520 --> 02:49:41.520]  I'm reading a story from the cannabis is actually where I found this.
[02:49:41.520 --> 02:49:46.520]  Because if you want cannabis news and you don't feel like hearing me rattle it off and stutter it, the cannabis has a lot of great stuff.
[02:49:46.520 --> 02:49:52.520]  My friend Kevin that works with pink house also sends me a lot of great info and I scour the web for this stuff to find it.
[02:49:52.520 --> 02:49:58.520]  If you've got something you want to hear, feel free to tweet it to me at I grow culture and I'll talk about it.
[02:49:58.520 --> 02:49:59.520]  Love to do that.
[02:49:59.520 --> 02:50:00.520]  Would love to do it.
[02:50:00.520 --> 02:50:01.520]  So what's going on in Idaho?
[02:50:01.520 --> 02:50:04.520]  These cops are pulling you over and fucking with you because you got Colorado plates.
[02:50:04.520 --> 02:50:12.520]  One guy, they detained him and they took his car to the police station and had six cops search his car for six hours and they didn't find anything.
[02:50:12.520 --> 02:50:15.520]  But the cop treated him like a prick the entire time.
[02:50:15.520 --> 02:50:17.520]  It was real accusatory that the man was carrying cannabis.
[02:50:17.520 --> 02:50:21.520]  Turns out the guy was an affluent businessman and has a little bit of money.
[02:50:21.520 --> 02:50:26.520]  So now he's sparking up a lawsuit against the police force that harassed him.
[02:50:26.520 --> 02:50:28.520]  So I can't wait to see how that turns out.
[02:50:28.520 --> 02:50:38.520]  The this story is making the rounds this week, but it's it's really just the the latest example of this happening in all the states around Colorado.
[02:50:39.520 --> 02:50:50.520]  It's been getting worse since we first passed our medical marijuana laws back in 1999 or at least after the dispensary explosion in 2008 is when it got real bad.
[02:50:50.520 --> 02:50:53.520]  Is Colorado license plates are like a big target on your back.
[02:50:53.520 --> 02:50:59.520]  If you're out of state, you're going to get pulled over at some point or people have been alleging this for years.
[02:50:59.520 --> 02:51:04.520]  There's a video of it that you can pull of people trying to record these encounters.
[02:51:04.520 --> 02:51:19.520]  There's a number of testimonies, I suppose you'd call them that have been put up on the Web of people being pulled over and harassed for hours, searched extensively for marijuana or other drugs because they've got Colorado plates.
[02:51:19.520 --> 02:51:27.520]  Mention what happened in Texas and this will be our last little in other states along the southern border, especially.
[02:51:27.520 --> 02:51:38.520]  There's been a number of cases in the last six months or a year or so of troopers pulling over people, not necessarily with Colorado plates plates from anywhere and saying, I think you have drugs.
[02:51:38.520 --> 02:51:43.520]  And when the person says, I'm sorry, officer, I don't have any drugs or contraband.
[02:51:44.520 --> 02:51:47.520]  The cop essentially keeps insisting you have drugs.
[02:51:47.520 --> 02:52:03.520]  And then in a number of examples, an example recorded on a dash cam, an officer performs vaginal and anal cavity searches on an aunt and a niece at the same time on the side of the road without changing their glove.
[02:52:03.520 --> 02:52:07.520]  I mean, just take a minute and throw up and I apologize for that.
[02:52:07.520 --> 02:52:08.520]  I want to make this nice and clear.
[02:52:08.520 --> 02:52:11.520]  But this is the side of a public highway in Texas.
[02:52:11.520 --> 02:52:16.520]  A cop car, your car, these ladies car on the side of the highway, lights are flashing.
[02:52:16.520 --> 02:52:17.520]  Yep.
[02:52:17.520 --> 02:52:19.520]  Aunt and niece on the side of the highway.
[02:52:19.520 --> 02:52:22.520]  Yep. Like a 40 year old and a 20 year old female.
[02:52:22.520 --> 02:52:24.520]  Probably handcuffed, feeling humiliated, scared.
[02:52:24.520 --> 02:52:29.520]  Yep. Terrified. I don't think they were handcuffed, but they definitely were humiliated and terrified.
[02:52:29.520 --> 02:52:34.520]  So this officer, I don't know if it was a trooper or a state patrol or what they were, this dick.
[02:52:34.520 --> 02:52:35.520]  Member of law enforcement.
[02:52:35.520 --> 02:52:39.520]  This Leo is what we call them. Took a rubber glove, put it on one hand.
[02:52:39.520 --> 02:52:40.520]  Yep.
[02:52:40.520 --> 02:52:41.520]  One glove.
[02:52:41.520 --> 02:52:42.520]  One glove on one hand.
[02:52:42.520 --> 02:52:43.520]  Suspect number one's vagina.
[02:52:43.520 --> 02:52:44.520]  Yep.
[02:52:44.520 --> 02:52:47.520]  Proceeded to spin suspect number one and then dig in person's anus.
[02:52:47.520 --> 02:52:48.520]  Yep.
[02:52:48.520 --> 02:52:50.520]  So front to back action here with the same glove.
[02:52:50.520 --> 02:52:51.520]  Same glove.
[02:52:51.520 --> 02:52:53.520]  Now here's the best part that I want to clear up.
[02:52:53.520 --> 02:52:57.520]  Went to the next suspect, which is now I'm calling a victim because you're being raped.
[02:52:57.520 --> 02:52:58.520]  Yep.
[02:52:58.520 --> 02:53:00.520]  Fingers in the butt to see if you got drugs.
[02:53:00.520 --> 02:53:01.520]  Yep.
[02:53:01.520 --> 02:53:03.520]  Fingers in the vagina to see if you got drugs.
[02:53:03.520 --> 02:53:05.520]  I believe it was the reverse order, but yes.
[02:53:05.520 --> 02:53:07.520]  Either way, that glove's been in your friend's butthole.
[02:53:07.520 --> 02:53:10.520]  That same glove, four orifices, two people.
[02:53:10.520 --> 02:53:12.520]  All of this I feel is...
[02:53:12.520 --> 02:53:15.520]  How many bacteria? Can you count the bacteria that got moved around in that transaction?
[02:53:15.520 --> 02:53:20.520]  I don't even want to know. If one of us did it, we'd be charged with forcible rape on two victims.
[02:53:20.520 --> 02:53:21.520]  And some sort of...
[02:53:21.520 --> 02:53:25.520]  The fact that it happened on the highway just because the cop felt like pulling him over and going,
[02:53:25.520 --> 02:53:28.520]  I think you've got drugs is appalling.
[02:53:28.520 --> 02:53:29.520]  That sucks.
[02:53:29.520 --> 02:53:33.520]  This is America. Land of the free, home of the brave. Are you kidding me?
[02:53:33.520 --> 02:53:40.520]  We're clearly terrified if we're raping women on the side of the highway with the same glove looking for a little weed.
[02:53:40.520 --> 02:53:43.520]  How much drugs could you have in a vagina?
[02:53:43.520 --> 02:53:47.520]  Does that warrant any of this?
[02:53:47.520 --> 02:53:49.520]  And this isn't an isolated example.
[02:53:49.520 --> 02:53:53.520]  When these stories break, a number of people come forward and say,
[02:53:53.520 --> 02:53:54.520]  that happened to me last October.
[02:53:54.520 --> 02:53:56.520]  And you can look all this stuff online.
[02:53:56.520 --> 02:53:58.520]  Please, Google anything I've said tonight.
[02:54:00.520 --> 02:54:01.520]  He said, please.
[02:54:01.520 --> 02:54:02.520]  Please.
[02:54:02.520 --> 02:54:04.520]  Do it. I really want you to do it.
[02:54:04.520 --> 02:54:06.520]  So that was a little bit of a disgusting note to end on.
[02:54:06.520 --> 02:54:08.520]  I really hate to take it there.
[02:54:08.520 --> 02:54:11.520]  But we're spoiled in Colorado.
[02:54:11.520 --> 02:54:23.520]  We have access to legal, regulated, well done marijuana that's produced and sold just about like every other product on the market.
[02:54:23.520 --> 02:54:31.520]  And we enjoy safety and oversight that you don't get in the majority of the other 49 states.
[02:54:31.520 --> 02:54:39.520]  And we also enjoy freedom from persecution because of our use of this beautiful plant.
[02:54:39.520 --> 02:54:40.520]  Beautiful plant.
[02:54:40.520 --> 02:54:42.520]  Alright, here's what I want everybody to do.
[02:54:42.520 --> 02:54:48.520]  If you don't want the new caregiver law to pass, I want you to call the state reps.
[02:54:48.520 --> 02:54:50.520]  And I'm an idiot and I don't have that phone number available.
[02:54:51.520 --> 02:54:53.520]  I would have to look through my phone and I feel like I've got a podcast to do.
[02:54:53.520 --> 02:54:55.520]  You can Google the rep for your area real easy.
[02:54:55.520 --> 02:55:00.520]  What I'm going to do, I will tweet it at I Grow Culture on Twitter.
[02:55:00.520 --> 02:55:03.520]  And I'll get that number out for you guys to call.
[02:55:03.520 --> 02:55:06.520]  I'm writing a note to do that because I'm a pothead and I'm forgetful.
[02:55:06.520 --> 02:55:12.520]  But do your best to contact your Colorado, your local Colorado rep and tell them not to change the caregiver account.
[02:55:12.520 --> 02:55:15.520]  And let us do what we're doing because we're not fucking around.
[02:55:15.520 --> 02:55:16.520]  We're trying to help sick people.
[02:55:17.520 --> 02:55:22.520]  Every rep in Colorado has a webpage with a button on it to make it easy to email them.
[02:55:22.520 --> 02:55:23.520]  Please do so.
[02:55:23.520 --> 02:55:24.520]  Do it.
[02:55:24.520 --> 02:55:30.520]  It's our responsibility to have, to fight for what we want.
[02:55:30.520 --> 02:55:31.520]  It's our responsibility to stand up and speak.
[02:55:31.520 --> 02:55:34.520]  If nobody speaks up, nobody speaks up.
[02:55:34.520 --> 02:55:38.520]  And if one of us speaks up and you see your buddy speaking up, it's that much easier to speak up.
[02:55:38.520 --> 02:55:39.520]  So go first.
[02:55:39.520 --> 02:55:44.520]  What traditionally happens is the people who are terrified of marijuana write five emails.
[02:55:44.520 --> 02:55:54.520]  And the people who have done their homework and know what it's capable of doing and helping with and all the positives that can come from it are too busy working to send an email.
[02:55:54.520 --> 02:55:55.520]  And it's sad.
[02:55:55.520 --> 02:55:56.520]  Send more emails.
[02:55:56.520 --> 02:55:58.520]  Contact your legislatures.
[02:55:58.520 --> 02:56:00.520]  Legislators.
[02:56:00.520 --> 02:56:03.520]  I've got cotton mouth real bad and my tongue's not cooperating.
[02:56:03.520 --> 02:56:05.520]  That means I'm doing a good job.
[02:56:05.520 --> 02:56:06.520]  You've succeeded, sir.
[02:56:06.520 --> 02:56:08.520]  Success.
[02:56:08.520 --> 02:56:10.520]  Victory is mine.
[02:56:10.520 --> 02:56:15.520]  I'm trying to pull up the outro song, but I'm going to just have to, oh, I'm reaching.
[02:56:15.520 --> 02:56:17.520]  I'm reaching.
[02:56:17.520 --> 02:56:18.520]  Word.
[02:56:18.520 --> 02:56:19.520]  Good night, everybody.
[02:56:19.520 --> 02:56:21.520]  Buy Colorado Breeders Seeds.
[02:56:21.520 --> 02:56:23.520]  I.R.E. genetics is pretty badass.
[02:56:23.520 --> 02:56:24.520]  There's a few others.
[02:56:24.520 --> 02:56:25.520]  You mentioned them earlier.
[02:56:25.520 --> 02:56:27.520]  Support Colorado.
[02:56:27.520 --> 02:56:29.520]  It's an awesome place to be.
[02:56:29.520 --> 02:56:33.520]  There was a question on the cannabis that you mentioned earlier about what you get to see.
[02:56:33.520 --> 02:56:36.520]  And I chuckled and I don't know the answer to that.
[02:56:36.520 --> 02:56:37.520]  Yeah.
[02:56:37.520 --> 02:56:38.520]  We know the answer to that.
[02:56:38.520 --> 02:56:41.520]  Anybody got any real shout outs that you want to say specifically?
[02:56:41.520 --> 02:56:42.520]  Anybody?
[02:56:42.520 --> 02:56:43.520]  Okay.
[02:56:43.520 --> 02:56:46.520]  Thanks for having me on again.
[02:56:46.520 --> 02:56:48.520]  Thanks for coming.
[02:56:48.520 --> 02:56:49.520]  You guys are my.
[02:56:49.520 --> 02:56:50.520]  For sure.
[02:56:50.520 --> 02:56:51.520]  I appreciate it.
[02:56:51.520 --> 02:56:52.520]  It was a blast.
[02:56:52.520 --> 02:56:53.520]  You guys are going to get some.
[02:56:53.520 --> 02:56:54.520]  We will have other people on.
[02:56:54.520 --> 02:56:55.520]  I've got a lot of other stuff planned out.
[02:56:55.520 --> 02:57:01.520]  I want to get comfortable and get good at that podcasting thing before I go and try to get people on that are going to feel like an asshole on my show.
[02:57:01.520 --> 02:57:02.520]  Yeah.
[02:57:02.520 --> 02:57:04.520]  And I want to thank you guys for enduring the first three.
[02:57:04.520 --> 02:57:06.520]  An hour and 17 minutes.
[02:57:06.520 --> 02:57:07.520]  It's ridiculous.
[02:57:07.520 --> 02:57:08.520]  Please check out.
[02:57:08.520 --> 02:57:09.520]  I can keep going.
[02:57:09.520 --> 02:57:10.520]  I read genetics colorado.com.
[02:57:10.520 --> 02:57:13.520]  No, you can't check out nature's green remedies.com.
[02:57:13.520 --> 02:57:26.520]  Follow me at agriculture on Twitter and go to at I read genetics on Instagram for tons of excellent and boasting for a lot of cannabis photography that I feel is high quality.
[02:57:26.520 --> 02:57:27.520]  Yep.
[02:57:27.520 --> 02:57:28.520]  Yep.
[02:57:28.520 --> 02:57:30.520]  I did keep listening.
[02:57:30.520 --> 02:57:32.520]  I promise to bring you great content.
[02:57:32.520 --> 02:57:33.520]  We'll improve every episode.
[02:57:33.520 --> 02:57:35.520]  So take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[02:58:37.520 --> 02:58:40.520]  No, no, no.
[02:58:40.520 --> 02:58:51.520]  We have to get to where Amy asks who's calling me from an unknown number on.
[02:58:51.520 --> 02:58:52.520]  No, no, no, no.
[02:58:52.520 --> 02:58:54.920]  the I grow culture podcast. I hope you enjoyed that.
[02:58:55.800 --> 02:58:58.960]  Uh, it was quite embarrassing for me. I cannot wait to hear your opinions.
[02:58:58.960 --> 02:59:03.560]  Please send me some tweets. It's at GFYH podcast. I would love to hear from you.
[02:59:03.760 --> 02:59:08.120]  You guys, please ignore all of the old social media stuff on all of the old
[02:59:08.120 --> 02:59:12.180]  episodes. Most of that is inaccurate. Please go with the at GFYH podcast,
[02:59:12.180 --> 02:59:14.880]  Twitter, the grow from your heart at hotmail.com email.
[02:59:15.080 --> 02:59:19.120]  All of that would be the best way to get in touch with me. Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:59:19.360 --> 02:59:22.240]  this episode has been long enough, so I'm getting out of here.
[02:59:22.600 --> 02:59:26.320]  Thanks for listening until next time. Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for
[02:59:26.320 --> 02:59:26.520]  me.
