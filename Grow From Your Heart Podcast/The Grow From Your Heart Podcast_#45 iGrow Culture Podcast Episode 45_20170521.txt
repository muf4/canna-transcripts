[00:29.970 --> 00:34.230]  grower, a pro grower, a long time cannabis consumer, a brand new smoker, or just someone
[00:34.230 --> 00:39.410]  who's curious about the current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you. I'm
[00:39.410 --> 00:44.170]  your host, Rasta Jeff. Thanks for joining me. Hanging out over to my left here is our
[00:44.170 --> 00:47.290]  good buddy, King Cola. How you doing buddy? Good man. Thanks for having me. Man, I started
[00:47.290 --> 00:51.650]  to choke right as I tried to introduce you. I apologize. I stumbled there. I just took
[00:51.650 --> 00:55.250]  a big giant dab and it took about a minute to kick in and it happened to be right at
[00:55.250 --> 01:00.330]  the start of the show. Wow. It's turned on the music. Then I won't have to yell. Wow.
[01:00.330 --> 01:04.610]  Across the table is Adam. How you doing bro? Good man. Tired. Tired. You're all red eyed
[01:04.610 --> 01:08.170]  and you got like drywall dust in your hair and shit. You have no idea. You look like
[01:08.170 --> 01:13.250]  a working man. Yeah. I'm dirty. Less video games and more working lately, right? Yeah.
[01:13.250 --> 01:18.370]  It's about time. They're even getting, um, you know, all rough and tumbled, rough and
[01:18.370 --> 01:22.330]  tumbled. You guys, this is the, uh, the holiday episode, whatever winter holiday it is that
[01:22.330 --> 01:25.930]  you celebrate. This will be your episode. So Merry holiday, whichever one you choose
[01:25.930 --> 01:30.810]  to label it as. I'm not going to judge you. I support all of your holiday decisions, whatever
[01:30.810 --> 01:35.170]  religion race creed you are. I hope you have a great winter holiday. I hope you get a lot
[01:35.170 --> 01:38.650]  of gifts. If you're into the gift giving thing, I hope you give a lot of gifts. I hope you
[01:38.650 --> 01:43.450]  give twice as many gifts as you receive. Bah humbug. You're not into the holiday thing,
[01:43.450 --> 01:48.210]  bro. No. What if, what if we try to change that for you? What do we give you gifts? Give
[01:48.210 --> 01:51.970]  your kids some gifts. I've gotten, I've gotten gifts that blow my mind in the past couple
[01:51.970 --> 01:56.050]  of years, but it's, it's always like now I feel obligated because I'm an adult and that's
[01:56.050 --> 02:01.690]  the proper thing to do. And I understand that that's not what it was about, but, um, yeah.
[02:01.690 --> 02:04.290]  What if we just bend down? What if we just hold you? It is a great example. Bender's
[02:04.290 --> 02:07.690]  great and kind person. You know what you're saying? Bender hooked you up with a fat gift
[02:07.730 --> 02:12.450]  and now you feel fucked. I feel fucked. Uh, the people that are able to give out kind
[02:12.450 --> 02:15.810]  gifts like that to our friends that we know can't give a gift like that. We do it because
[02:15.810 --> 02:19.410]  we know that you want that shit and that you deserve it and we don't expect anything in
[02:19.410 --> 02:21.970]  return. You're going to fucking play with that. You're going to throw that thing. He
[02:21.970 --> 02:26.490]  gave you, he, our buddy Bender gave Adam, can I say that? He gave you a video card,
[02:26.490 --> 02:29.050]  a graphics card for your computer and you're going to love it, dude. That's what it's about.
[02:29.050 --> 02:32.690]  He's going to see you smiling and all shitted and giggled and you're playing with it. And
[02:32.690 --> 02:36.630]  that's what it's about. It ain't about you giving him back a gift. Yeah, absolutely.
[02:36.630 --> 02:40.270]  And thank you. You know, yeah. So cheer up and fucking enjoy the holidays with us or
[02:40.270 --> 02:43.990]  we'll hold you down and tickle you. You know, I try with the kids, but it's hard. How's
[02:43.990 --> 02:47.310]  that going to make you feel when two grown men hold you down and tickle you? Have you
[02:47.310 --> 02:53.910]  been tickled as a grown man? Not since I left Florida. This just took an awkward turn. I'm
[02:53.910 --> 02:57.870]  going to try to put it back on track. Um, I want to mention something. I mentioned it's
[02:57.870 --> 03:02.350]  the holiday season. iTunes sent me an email and they say that there will be a delay in
[03:02.350 --> 03:07.910]  podcast posting between December 22nd and January 5th, which will affect this episode
[03:07.910 --> 03:12.710]  and possibly another episode. I will post them early. I'll try to get them. We're recording
[03:12.710 --> 03:16.990]  on a Thursday. The show comes out on a Monday. I'll try to put it up like Saturday night
[03:16.990 --> 03:21.070]  and hopefully that'll give iTunes time to do whatever it is they're doing. I'm not sure
[03:21.070 --> 03:25.590]  why they choose to do that around Christmas time, but people love it early. They can love
[03:25.590 --> 03:29.310]  it early. Yeah. If it makes it, it may not. I don't know what it's going to do. Also,
[03:29.710 --> 03:33.470]  I want to remind you guys, we're going to change the name of the podcast. Eventually
[03:33.470 --> 03:37.930]  I said December 1st, but I was high. I met January 1st. Uh, we're going to start calling
[03:37.930 --> 03:43.910]  it the grow from your heart podcast because I grow is actually a horticulture agricultural
[03:43.910 --> 03:49.030]  educational institution that does not want me associating their name with our beloved
[03:49.030 --> 03:52.930]  sacred plant. So before they send me a cease and desist letter, I'm just going to go ahead
[03:52.930 --> 03:57.610]  and switch it up. It's the responsible thing to do. That's kind. I don't want to rip off
[03:57.610 --> 04:01.810]  anybody else's name. You know, if somebody else was called, I grow culture, uh, I'd be
[04:01.810 --> 04:05.210]  pissed off about that, you know, and, or if they were called I read genetics, I'd be double
[04:05.210 --> 04:11.010]  pissed. So I gotta be fair. It's very noble. Yeah, it's, you know, just, uh, I want to
[04:11.010 --> 04:14.330]  move your mic closer to you, but you've got, yeah, you've got that beautiful hit man rig
[04:14.330 --> 04:17.570]  in front of you that you grabbed. Did you get that at the Emerald cup? Yeah, that is
[04:17.570 --> 04:21.690]  sexy. Thank you. Uh, I didn't write down any space for you to ramble about the Emerald
[04:21.690 --> 04:25.490]  cup, but do you want to tell us about your experience for a second? Uh, yeah, the Emerald
[04:25.490 --> 04:29.970]  cup, it was a good, that way. There you go. Yeah. The Emerald cup was a great time. Uh,
[04:29.970 --> 04:34.970]  I'd highly recommend, uh, all growers to try to make it out to that one. Uh, best cup I've
[04:34.970 --> 04:40.610]  ever seen. Nice. That's a huge thing to say. Yeah. It's way different. It's not as tongue
[04:40.610 --> 04:46.930]  in cheek is the cannabis cup. There's, it's not a stereotypical. Yeah. So less of a, less
[04:46.930 --> 04:51.410]  of an RV show and more of a growers kind of a thing. And it's in Santa Rosa, California,
[04:51.410 --> 04:55.250]  right? Yes. Awesome. So you flew out there. Do you hang out with Baca a lot? Yeah. Yeah.
[04:55.250 --> 04:58.130]  I mean, him went out there to shout out to Baca. He's never gotten a, a shout out on
[04:58.130 --> 05:01.650]  the podcast. What's up James. Sending you some love, bro. Hopefully you get to dab sometime
[05:01.650 --> 05:06.450]  soon. We keep talking about it. It just doesn't happen. All of us growers. Yeah. All the growers
[05:06.450 --> 05:10.490]  are hard to get in one room together. Yeah, I know. And it's like, we went to Cali and
[05:10.490 --> 05:16.490]  it's like for four days and you know, it sounds great, but four days for growers and eternity,
[05:16.490 --> 05:20.810]  I'm still trying to recover from that. And that third day you're like going, I wonder
[05:20.810 --> 05:24.610]  if everything's alive. I wonder you on the flight, you're like, I just want to, can you
[05:24.610 --> 05:28.810]  just fly over my house? I just want to come on. I want to see if it burned down or something.
[05:28.810 --> 05:33.210]  You know, you're always got the worst ideas in your head. Adam, you've been working a
[05:33.210 --> 05:40.250]  lot, bro. What you working on, man? Just some grow up buildings. It's is it the one that
[05:40.250 --> 05:44.170]  we talked about last? Yeah. But so for the whole Denver Bud company, Denver Bud company,
[05:44.170 --> 05:46.970]  you guys are still putting that together. Yep. Yep. Do you know how many lights are
[05:46.970 --> 05:55.850]  going in there? More, a lot, a lot, more than a lot. I would say 55 to 75 per unit.
[05:55.850 --> 06:04.330]  Okay. Uh, I don't want to give exact units, but it's still single digit units. Okay. Sounds
[06:04.330 --> 06:07.650]  like you're a busy man. Yeah. Yeah. Putting in the hours. There was nothing there. And
[06:07.650 --> 06:11.730]  the guy that was there doing it, um, was there all alone. And I mean, I don't know if you've
[06:11.730 --> 06:16.770]  ever tried to do construction all alone, but it's hard. You can't really do a lot of construction
[06:17.570 --> 06:21.770]  by yourself. You're just slow cutting and doing and cutting and doing measure twice,
[06:21.770 --> 06:25.810]  cut once, nail it up, measure twice, cut once. And then you need someone to help you. It's
[06:25.810 --> 06:28.890]  easier if you got someone to hold the shit. Right. When he told me, I literally laughed
[06:28.890 --> 06:35.570]  at him. I was like, Hey, that's great. Uh, but we, you know, that's it's a good job.
[06:35.570 --> 06:39.290]  I can't, I can't bitch. And hopefully it holds out through the end of the month. Cause I
[06:39.290 --> 06:43.370]  really needed the stuff for the kids and Christmas. Oh, it's good timing. Right? Yeah. Yeah. For
[06:43.930 --> 06:47.570]  I was kind of busy today myself, dude, today. I want to give a big shout out to my homie
[06:47.570 --> 06:53.650]  Spence, uh, Spence and I have been talking about me learning how to make dabs because
[06:53.650 --> 06:58.810]  I smoke a lot of hash and I grow my own herb. I am sufficient all the way from, I can create
[06:58.810 --> 07:02.770]  my own seeds. I can germinate, I can grow the seeds. I can harvest it. I can trim it.
[07:02.770 --> 07:06.970]  Then I've got the product that is done as flowers and trim. And then I like to smoke
[07:06.970 --> 07:11.390]  dabs. So I had to learn how to turn that into the dabs. I want today's spent Spence spent
[07:11.390 --> 07:15.510]  about four or five hours teaching me how to do that. We ran a couple of batches. I
[07:15.510 --> 07:20.270]  got to run some tubes myself. Uh, I've got all the way up to, uh, the point when we put
[07:20.270 --> 07:24.470]  it in the vac oven, I understand all of that and I understand the vac oven. I just don't
[07:24.470 --> 07:28.430]  know the controls on the oven very well myself. Once I get that comfortable, I think I can
[07:28.430 --> 07:32.670]  make pretty good quality shatter. There's a batch of my shatter that I blasted sitting
[07:32.670 --> 07:37.070]  in the back of it right now, waiting for me to, uh, check it out in about 48 hours. Spence
[07:37.070 --> 07:42.110]  is going to flip it cause it's in his, uh, his facility, but I'm kind of proud. I'm kind
[07:42.110 --> 07:45.710]  of excited. That's awesome. Yeah. So we'll go from seed to shatter. It'll go all the
[07:45.710 --> 07:49.910]  way from the germination all the way to my dabber now all in house. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks.
[07:49.910 --> 07:54.510]  So I don't know about congrats yet. I, uh, I've watched and tried once. It's always experimental
[07:54.510 --> 07:57.910]  process. Yeah. I mean, just trying to learn something. Yeah. Uh, getting out of the comfort
[07:57.910 --> 08:02.310]  zone. I've been really, I've, I was comfortable. I realized that was comfortable for a year.
[08:02.310 --> 08:05.950]  Like I've, I had I read genetics go and I haven't done anything for a year. I've got,
[08:05.950 --> 08:09.990]  I've expanded and learn and grown, but now I've got this new growth facility with 227
[08:09.990 --> 08:13.310]  lights. Now I'm learning how to make cash. I'm definitely getting out of the comfort
[08:13.310 --> 08:18.190]  zone. Yeah. Nothing's more comfortable than just blasting a QP. Like, yeah, let's see
[08:18.190 --> 08:22.110]  what happens. Let me see if I can make hash. Yeah. Throw down three ounces of your favorite
[08:22.110 --> 08:27.230]  lemon Jeffrey and just run it and see what happens. Yeah. My forearms are a little, uh,
[08:27.230 --> 08:31.630]  there's a lot of work involved. Yeah. It's not as easy as you might think. Uh, speaking
[08:31.630 --> 08:36.190]  of me making dabs, uh, this podcast is brought to you by our good friends at highly educated
[08:36.190 --> 08:40.870]  titanium. If you're using high quality concentrates made by Rasta, Jeff or garden of Whedon, or
[08:40.870 --> 08:44.950]  even this water hash, a solvent list, what do you call it? Sean? Full melt, full melt
[08:44.950 --> 08:48.630]  hash that Sean made and brought over that stuff is tasty and dank. You deserve a high
[08:48.630 --> 08:53.270]  quality titanium nail. That's made right here in America. They're made in Provo, Utah by
[08:53.270 --> 08:57.710]  our good friend task rock. Don't trust a cheap Chinese nail. Don't trust an American knockoff

[09:24.870 --> 09:30.270]  fit your 14 and your 18 millimeter rig. They've got one old fit your 10, uh, your 11 and your
[09:30.270 --> 09:33.950]  12. You can get a carb cap to go with that. I think that would make anybody at this table
[09:33.950 --> 09:37.790]  pretty happy. If you got a nail on a carb cap in the mail. Yeah. Yeah. See everybody
[09:37.790 --> 09:41.430]  looked at me like, I don't have one for you. You look down. No, no, no, no. They've got
[09:41.430 --> 09:44.590]  cool colors now. They do have cool colors. Sean's is kind of, is that purple? Would you
[09:44.590 --> 09:48.190]  call that pink? Purple? This one right here is a purple. So yours is pink. Yeah. Well,
[09:48.190 --> 09:51.950]  it's pink though. Thank you. And then I got a blue one too. Sorry. I'm spoiled guys. I
[09:51.950 --> 09:55.750]  got multiple colors. I said goodbye. Your lady of pink. Yeah, dude, there's nothing.
[09:55.750 --> 09:59.190]  You're manly as fuck for carrying that pink one around with pride and the pink torch.
[09:59.190 --> 10:05.710]  Jeez, this guy's Dick must be huge. Speaking of big dicks, make sure you check out highly
[10:05.710 --> 10:12.030]  educated titanium.com. I also want to give a big thanks to Adams right in front of me,
[10:12.030 --> 10:15.950]  dude. Thank you. You helped me out a whole fucking bunch. You helped me transplant a
[10:15.950 --> 10:21.630]  large number of plants and it took us hours and I appreciate that. Also shout out to Mike.
[10:22.310 --> 10:26.310]  We got our fingernails real dirty. We got sweaty. I made these guys listen to reggae
[10:26.310 --> 10:31.550]  and then we got tired and something really weird happened at the grow. I blasted Pantera
[10:31.550 --> 10:35.870]  as loud as it would freaking go for a good album worth. And that's really out of character
[10:35.870 --> 10:40.070]  for me, but it got us pumped up. We were a little bit getting burned out and that Pantera
[10:40.070 --> 10:43.710]  really got the mosh pit in the room going. It was at the point where there's like, where's
[10:43.710 --> 10:49.070]  the rest of the work? And there was no more work. So yeah, it worked. It went pretty quickly.
[10:49.070 --> 10:52.230]  You guys knocked it out. So huge. Thanks dude. I could have done. It took the three
[10:52.230 --> 10:55.670]  of us most of the night. So imagine watching me try to do that myself. As I've said, it's
[10:55.670 --> 10:58.750]  a learning process for me. So I'm going to do a couple of quick ads and then we'll keep
[10:58.750 --> 11:01.630]  this going. I'm trying to keep the momentum going in the conversation. This podcast is

[12:10.910 --> 12:16.270]  the, uh, the girl scout cookies crossed to the King Kim grape stomper OG and she killed
[12:16.270 --> 12:20.030]  it bro. Uh, Maddie got her own little grow space over at the garden of Whedon and she
[12:20.030 --> 12:24.590]  put some of my seeds in there and they look freaking marvelous. So good job, Maddie. I'm

[14:35.670 --> 14:41.430]  Www.tree thugger.com. I'm going to go see the string cheese incident on new year's eve
[14:41.430 --> 14:47.110]  for all three nights. Uh, you guarantee there'll be some shit about that on tree thugger.com.
[14:47.110 --> 14:49.830]  I won't write it, but I know that that shit will be up there because a lot of the hippies
[14:49.830 --> 14:53.470]  will like it. You can put the rig by the, by the mic. Nobody minds here. And that makes
[14:53.470 --> 14:58.190]  them feel like they're there with us listening to your torch. Um, also I'm going to read
[14:58.190 --> 15:01.390]  part of an email. I want to give a shout out. So that's all the commercials guys. If you're
[15:01.390 --> 15:04.510]  fast forwarding through commercials, you could stop right now and just listen to this part.
[15:04.510 --> 15:09.390]  I got to find my phone. Um, I have a couple of notes on my phone that I want to make sure
[15:09.390 --> 15:14.030]  I read. Go ahead, Adam. You got something for me. I, um, I went on the forums the other
[15:14.030 --> 15:16.750]  day and I was just looking through there. It seems like you're getting more response
[15:16.750 --> 15:21.630]  on the forums as well. Uh, it's not like a dramatic, but when I logged in, there was
[15:21.630 --> 15:26.350]  only like X amount of users and now there's, you know, a little bit more than double. I
[15:26.350 --> 15:29.790]  think I've been pulled and you can't say just a little because every one of those people
[15:29.790 --> 15:35.190]  I'm fucking grateful for. I don't say there's only 63. I say there are fucking 63. Yay.
[15:35.190 --> 15:38.430]  And I don't, I'm making up a number, but I'm excited for each one of them. Like I, uh,
[15:38.430 --> 15:42.630]  and he's talking about the I read genetics, Colorado website forum. So that's, I post
[15:42.630 --> 15:46.310]  a lot of stuff there. I haven't been there for like a week because I got this new job
[15:46.310 --> 15:50.030]  and I've been kind of scrambling to get a whole bunch of shit done before I start there.
[15:50.030 --> 15:53.550]  But trust me, I'll be back. I live on that website sometimes. I want to give a shout
[15:53.550 --> 15:58.430]  out to our good friend, Jake. Jake sent me an email. Uh, I kind of can't read the whole
[15:58.430 --> 16:01.590]  thing because of some of the stuff that he says. He kind of asked me not to say some
[16:01.590 --> 16:07.190]  stuff that he wrote, but he ends this with a congrats on the new job and keep up the
[16:07.190 --> 16:11.590]  good work. You're doing your part in making my 12 hour shift bearable. And for that, I
[16:11.590 --> 16:16.430]  am grateful. So big up dude. Thanks for the compliments. That kind of stuff right there
[16:16.430 --> 16:20.710]  makes the hours that I put into this show worth it. It makes these guys come in. John
[16:20.710 --> 16:23.870]  puts part of his day aside to come here and hang out. Adam has to break away from his
[16:23.870 --> 16:27.870]  family. Jesse's got a construction company, a grow business, a hydro shop. These guys
[16:27.870 --> 16:31.270]  have to break away from their lives. So hearing these compliments really lets us know that
[16:31.270 --> 16:35.310]  you're loving it. It makes it worth it. Honestly, it makes it to me and I'd do it even if he
[16:35.310 --> 16:39.150]  didn't, but it really, it's like, yay, someone's listening. So big shout out to Jake. I appreciate
[16:39.150 --> 16:42.850]  it, bro. That's pretty awesome that you did that. And I won't say the rest of your message
[16:42.970 --> 16:48.530]  because you said some cool stuff that I don't need to say. Um, I've got more stuff written
[16:48.530 --> 16:51.330]  down. Let's get into the news. You guys want to talk some news real quick or do you want
[16:51.330 --> 16:54.570]  me to ask Sean questions? There's a lot of stuff. There's a lot of cool stuff. Sean will
[16:54.570 --> 16:57.450]  have an opinion on this. I just want to give Sean some room to talk. He's patient and quiet
[16:57.450 --> 17:01.810]  over there. Nice and polite. Uh, and local news. I hope you guys have an opinion on this.
[17:01.810 --> 17:05.530]  It's not really cannabis related, but the Westboro Baptist church is coming to our town
[17:05.530 --> 17:10.130]  to pick it at our courthouse and at two local dispensaries. They're coming here because
[17:10.130 --> 17:17.130]  our town, uh, supports gay rights. We have a, uh, a gay woman who is one of our, uh,
[17:17.650 --> 17:22.850]  representatives and she's a cool ass lady and I support her in every way. And the web,
[17:22.850 --> 17:28.810]  uh, Westboro Baptist church wants to come here and protest us because we have gay rights
[17:28.810 --> 17:31.830]  here. And then once they're done protesting at our courthouse, they're going to go to
[17:31.830 --> 17:37.850]  two dispensaries and protest over there in Pueblo West. Um, I'm flattered you guys are
[17:37.850 --> 17:42.370]  coming, but fuck off. We don't need you. We are our own town. We're adults. Uh, what
[17:42.370 --> 17:47.290]  are you going to do to go worry about your own damn town? Do that over there. Yeah, it's
[17:47.290 --> 17:52.170]  just hate. I mean, yeah, it's hate. There's people that are right. Crazy. Yeah. And in
[17:52.170 --> 17:55.850]  my opinion, no matter what religion you are, no matter what you believe in, I think be
[17:55.850 --> 17:59.910]  kind and love everybody is what you're supposed to do. And they're being very hypocritical.
[17:59.910 --> 18:03.610]  They're not being kind. They're not loving anybody. They're preaching. Hey, they're driving
[18:03.650 --> 18:08.490]  from another, they're driving from Kansas to come to Colorado to show how angry they
[18:08.490 --> 18:13.210]  are at us. I didn't realize they were that close. Get a life. That's how I feel about
[18:13.210 --> 18:17.330]  that. Absolutely. Like, don't you have some shit to do at home? I bet that while I know
[18:17.330 --> 18:22.510]  I can't be presumptuous, I thought I can, but I'm going to do it. I'm going to play
[18:22.510 --> 18:26.890]  devil's advocate. Do you think that while mom and dad are here protesting that little
[18:26.890 --> 18:31.130]  Jimmy smoking a joint in Kansas and little Sarah's getting butt fucked by Jimmy's older
[18:31.130 --> 18:35.730]  brother? I've definitely, if not much weirder shit going on, because it's Kansas, right?
[18:35.730 --> 18:38.690]  The brother and sister are just getting it in the living room while the parents are here
[18:38.690 --> 18:42.850]  protesting. I've seen, I hope their children that they have, their kids are getting gay
[18:42.850 --> 18:48.890]  and smoking weed while they're here protesting, watching duck dynasty, watching duck dynasty,
[18:48.890 --> 18:53.370]  watching porn, getting gay, smoking weed, drinking forties, uh, wearing camo, saying
[18:53.370 --> 18:58.530]  the N word, but not in a racial word, calling them, calling each other. Yeah. Yeah. Like
[18:58.530 --> 19:01.410]  it's cool. Yup. Like it's cool. I hope that's what your kids are doing while you're here
[19:01.410 --> 19:06.170]  protesting. As soon as you get home, it's back to the polo shirts and yes mama, but
[19:06.170 --> 19:09.490]  I truly am flattered. There are a lot of places for them to go and they chose here because
[19:09.490 --> 19:12.650]  we have gay rights and cannabis. I just figured they'd run it out. They're running out of
[19:12.650 --> 19:17.890]  places to go. I don't want to be offensive to a lot of people. Just, just the West. I
[19:17.890 --> 19:21.290]  can't even say the name of them. They bother me so much. Just this one group. They just
[19:21.290 --> 19:24.530]  piss me off. I know I've said a lot of roots. I kind of wanted to know the name of the dispensary
[19:24.530 --> 19:29.610]  side. Be like, eh, they're going to Marisol is the first one they listed. You know what?
[19:29.610 --> 19:34.370]  I think I took a screenshot of the article here. Um, because that's how I was just saving
[19:34.370 --> 19:38.050]  news on my phone. No, I didn't take a screenshot of the article, but I know they're going to
[19:38.050 --> 19:42.410]  Marisol and one other one. Uh, and if you said the name of it, it may be Pueblo West
[19:42.410 --> 19:46.850]  organics actually, but it was not the spot. Uh, shout out to the spot. That's the spot
[19:46.850 --> 19:50.610]  that I would represent. They should go there. It's where the good weeds going to be. So
[19:50.610 --> 19:56.530]  that's our local news in bigger news. Colorado is being sued by, I'm looking for the article
[19:56.530 --> 20:00.130]  in my phone. Colorado is being sued by the States of Nebraska and Oklahoma. Have you
[20:00.130 --> 20:03.090]  heard about this yet? No, not yet. Cool. Sean's lighting a joint over there. He looks like
[20:03.090 --> 20:06.970]  he's ready for this story. Uh, today the States of Nebraska and Oklahoma announced that they
[20:06.970 --> 20:12.330]  have filed lawsuits against Colorado alleging that Colorado's amendment 64 is unconstitutional.
[20:12.330 --> 20:16.050]  Colorado's attorney general, John Southers issued the following statement in response
[20:16.050 --> 20:19.810]  because neighboring States have expressed concern about Colorado grown marijuana coming
[20:19.810 --> 20:24.290]  into their States. We are not entirely surprised by this action. However, it appears the plaintiff's
[20:24.290 --> 20:29.370]  primary grievance stems from a non-enforcement of federal laws regarding marijuana, as opposed
[20:29.370 --> 20:34.250]  to choices made by the others of Colorado. We believe this suit is without merit and
[20:34.250 --> 20:41.050]  we will vigorously defend it against it in the U S Supreme court. So Nebraska and Oklahoma
[20:41.050 --> 20:45.210]  are trying to sue Colorado because we are not following federal rule. They're going
[20:45.210 --> 20:50.050]  to try to force the feds to come in here and clean up the weed scene that we've created.
[20:50.050 --> 20:54.610]  They're jelly all that money. You think they're jelly? No, I don't think that, but those aren't
[20:54.610 --> 20:58.970]  States that this place, they're not very popular in the first place. I don't think they're
[20:58.970 --> 21:02.730]  really worried about that. Yeah. Those are places that pretty much lock you up forever
[21:02.730 --> 21:08.130]  for having herb. They don't like it at all there. And I know it's happening because I
[21:08.130 --> 21:12.450]  know people, we read about them getting busted all the time. People are definitely driving
[21:12.450 --> 21:16.770]  pounds, pounds and pounds out of this state because we're able to produce it. Yeah. But
[21:16.770 --> 21:23.890]  do you really think it was any more than before? Yes. Um, there, there is more cannabis, smaller
[21:23.890 --> 21:28.930]  amounts. Uh, well when more personal, were you here for the wild, wild West revolution
[21:28.930 --> 21:32.730]  that I talk about when everybody got a red card and there was nobody to care to regulate
[21:32.730 --> 21:36.130]  it and everybody just grew. When I first got here, at least when I first got here, there
[21:36.130 --> 21:40.570]  wasn't the whole badge system or anything like anybody could, I worked at the dispensary
[21:40.690 --> 21:43.930]  and you could grow. I could walk into your shop with a backpack full of quarter pounds
[21:43.930 --> 21:49.610]  and sell them to you. Right? Yeah. So imagine if you were getting here, it was seven to
[21:49.610 --> 21:54.010]  eight, maybe nine. If you could really hustle the shop for a quarter pound. But I know friends
[21:54.010 --> 21:59.190]  that will maybe send shit to the East coast and they can get 15 for that same quarter
[21:59.190 --> 22:03.730]  pound to their cousin that live or their brother that lives out there and they just don't give
[22:03.730 --> 22:07.730]  a shit. They're like, why not? And they'll just send it or drive it out there. And what's
[22:07.730 --> 22:11.890]  to if you're a 20 something year old kid with no kids, what's my point of view is just
[22:11.890 --> 22:16.450]  the, the weeds, it's either going to come from California, it's going to come from Washington
[22:16.450 --> 22:19.450]  or it's going to come from Colorado. So I feel like the weeds just going to be moving
[22:19.450 --> 22:23.370]  across those States anyways, regardless of whether they sue us, it'll just go right back
[22:23.370 --> 22:29.490]  to wherever they were getting the, uh, the solution would just be a nationwide legalization,
[22:29.490 --> 22:33.930]  you know, medicine without borders. We just start a new, a new program, medicine without
[22:33.930 --> 22:39.170]  borders and just make it known. And we'll just drive around your fucking state. They're
[22:39.170 --> 22:42.770]  talking about giving it to a convicts and stuff too. It's been your mic a little towards
[22:42.770 --> 22:45.970]  your face, please. They're talking about this, they're giving it to convicts as well. How
[22:45.970 --> 22:51.810]  rich you sound. Yeah. You sound like you're up in there, up in there. Get it. I like it.
[22:51.810 --> 22:54.610]  So anyways, they're talking about giving it to convicts. We might've taken a lot of dabs
[22:54.610 --> 23:02.090]  before this show. And I think that would help. Yeah. Yeah. Convicts just in jail, bro. Just,
[23:02.090 --> 23:06.210]  I think that what you saw was on the onion and I don't think that that was wrong. I don't
[23:06.210 --> 23:11.890]  know. Christie pointed it out to me. Oh, that. Yeah. Um, consider your source, bro. All right,
[23:11.890 --> 23:17.370]  cool. I didn't, I didn't read a source. I just kind of fucking internet. Yeah. He could
[23:17.370 --> 23:21.890]  be right, but I'm pretty sure all I know is that I've, you know, just use, spend a little
[23:21.890 --> 23:27.250]  bit of time and weed makes it not right. It makes it not so annoying. Oh yeah. The loudness
[23:27.250 --> 23:30.730]  in the, well, that's why we'd cures to Brett helps with depression. It makes things that
[23:30.770 --> 23:34.410]  suck. Not as, Oh yeah, absolutely. That's why people get that. I have to work at Taco
[23:34.410 --> 23:37.890]  Bell all day. Get fucking blazed right. And before they go to Taco Bell all day, then
[23:37.890 --> 23:42.130]  when you try to order your food, I don't even want to go off on another rant. The guy at
[23:42.130 --> 23:48.370]  subway the other day was way higher than we were. And that's saying something. Yeah. There's
[23:48.370 --> 23:55.130]  a time and place for that. I've got an article. Um, I hope I saved it. Oh look, it's refreshing.
[23:55.130 --> 24:02.130]  You might not have internet service. Come on computer. If that happens, then we're making
[24:03.330 --> 24:08.610]  a 45 minute video on how bad it sucks. How about the internet sucks? Oh look, there's
[24:08.610 --> 24:13.410]  not another internet company. Is there? No, no. Yeah. We don't get an option in our area.
[24:13.410 --> 24:18.310]  We get one provider. So a little less anxiety for medical marijuana States on F on a federal
[24:18.310 --> 24:22.290]  level is the next article here. It's from the cannabis and it's published December 12th
[24:22.530 --> 24:27.930]  and it's from Kyle Potter of the associated press. And it says buried deep inside the
[24:27.930 --> 24:33.530]  1,600 page funding bill Congress is scrambling to pass to avert a shutdown. A few lines can
[24:33.530 --> 24:38.290]  form come. Sorry. Let me try that again. A few lines comforted Minnesota officials worried
[24:38.290 --> 24:41.650]  about the federal government cracking down on the state's new metal medical marijuana
[24:41.650 --> 24:44.530]  program. I'm going to kind of skim a little bit here because I want to get to more of
[24:44.530 --> 24:49.970]  this stuff. I just wanted to read this one. Uh, in its current form, the $1.1 trillion
[24:49.970 --> 24:53.650]  spending bill includes a section that bans the department of justice from using federal
[24:53.650 --> 24:58.690]  funds to intervene with States with medical marijuana laws. That's the best part right
[24:58.690 --> 25:02.290]  there. I can almost stop the whole article right there. So what that says is I'm going
[25:02.290 --> 25:07.490]  to read it again in its current form, the $1.1 trillion spending bill, wrap your money,
[25:07.490 --> 25:12.210]  name, wrap your head around that fucking number real quick. $1.1 trillion. But then it says
[25:12.210 --> 25:16.730]  bans the department of justice from using federal funds to intervene in States with
[25:16.730 --> 25:21.810]  medical marijuana laws, which means they can't fuck with us now. I mean, they can cause
[25:21.810 --> 25:25.010]  they'll find a way, but they're not going to mess with the States. They're not going
[25:25.010 --> 25:28.250]  to try to come and make us switch our laws back. They're not going to, I don't think
[25:28.250 --> 25:31.610]  they're going to continue with raids. There's still going to be illegal grow ops. There's
[25:31.610 --> 25:37.490]  still going to be illegal stuff going on that they're going to have to, it says 23 States
[25:37.490 --> 25:41.690]  have legalized medical marijuana, but those measures still conflict with federal law.
[25:41.690 --> 25:45.730]  And though the Obama administration has generally been friendlier to marijuana than administrations
[25:45.730 --> 25:51.530]  past months in Regala wondered what if that changes or a new president changes court,
[25:51.530 --> 25:55.850]  changes course, the U S house narrowly passed the funding bill with the medical marijuana
[25:55.850 --> 26:02.150]  section Thursday, this Senate was expected to take it up Friday. So he doubts the bill
[26:02.150 --> 26:07.410]  will markedly change the government's handling of the issue. Most attorneys have indicated
[26:07.410 --> 26:11.970]  they won't go after medical marijuana businesses. So as long as they're following state laws.
[26:11.970 --> 26:14.930]  So the point is, I think it gives them a little more comfort and I wouldn't say it gives very
[26:14.930 --> 26:18.910]  much more comfort, but you never know. He continued. The bottom line is it's still illegal
[26:18.910 --> 26:23.330]  under federal law. So anything could happen, but they don't have funding. So what are they
[26:23.330 --> 26:27.130]  going to do? These cops aren't going to go and raid shit on their own time. Are they?
[26:27.130 --> 26:32.410]  There was California that did, but I mean, then you're also, if a cop's going to go off
[26:32.410 --> 26:37.810]  and do that on his own time without support, he may be looking for that lucrative income.
[26:37.810 --> 26:42.010]  Yeah. That's not going to fly in Colorado though. No, no, no, but I'm just saying, yeah,
[26:42.010 --> 26:45.370]  it sounds like to me, it's going to lead to bad to cops. All right. So we've gone like
[26:45.370 --> 26:49.770]  25 minutes. Let's get into some talk about this organic stuff. I want to make sure that
[26:49.770 --> 26:53.010]  I got through all the important part, paid all the bills. Yeah, I'm good. I'm caught
[26:53.010 --> 26:56.410]  up. I'm paying attention. I got notes and shit. You guys, this is like almost a real
[26:56.410 --> 27:01.290]  show. You wouldn't even believe it. Episode 50 is coming up and I'm getting excited. I'm
[27:01.290 --> 27:04.890]  starting to think about what we can give away. Hey Jesse, if you're listening to do, remember
[27:04.890 --> 27:07.450]  you guys kind of volunteered to give some shit away on number 50. We've got to talk
[27:07.450 --> 27:12.650]  about that. Uh, so you're going to say something, go for it. We've been kind of like trying
[27:12.650 --> 27:17.650]  to figure out what to give away. Nice. So he's been bouncing things off me and I've
[27:17.650 --> 27:21.850]  been bouncing things off him and he's like, go tweet us. Let us know what you want. Uh,
[27:21.850 --> 27:25.650]  if you guys are listening, tweet me at, I grow culture or you email me. I grow culture
[27:25.650 --> 27:29.170]  at hotmail.com. Let us know what you want for giveaway prizes and we'll see if we can
[27:29.170 --> 27:34.170]  accommodate you. So Sean's here. The guy that talked a whole bunch about cool organic shit,
[27:34.170 --> 27:38.730]  green cola. You guys loved that show. A drying and curing and that organics episode have
[27:38.730 --> 27:43.730]  been my two most popular episodes out of 44 episodes. Awesome. Yeah. Yeah. People learned
[27:43.730 --> 27:48.330]  a lot of people asked a lot of questions. I can't shout out everybody that emailed me,
[27:48.330 --> 27:52.490]  texted me, uh, tweetered me because I would spend a whole show doing it. But we got a
[27:52.490 --> 27:56.410]  lot of response on that. I want to talk more about worm castings mostly because that's
[27:56.410 --> 28:00.130]  kind of what seemed to be the base of a lot of your stuff and a lot of what got the conversation
[28:00.130 --> 28:05.650]  going. Um, I'm going to jump back. We were talking about worm castings. We've got, uh,
[28:05.650 --> 28:10.030]  for our basic T you said worm castings and molasses and you mentioned multiplying the
[28:10.030 --> 28:15.590]  protozoa is something that you really stressed. Uh, so first of all, I guess my main question
[28:15.590 --> 28:23.090]  I should ask is what are protozoa? Uh, protozoa or just other microorganisms, uh, in the pro
[28:23.090 --> 28:29.530]  it's not just the protozoa, it's everything. It's all of the microbes in there. Yeah. Yeah.
[28:29.530 --> 28:34.090]  So you've got fungi and bacteria and all of these beneficial things. So you're just
[28:34.090 --> 28:38.010]  going to give them a food source and really give them a chance to thrive and grow. So
[28:38.010 --> 28:42.170]  all of those things actually fall under the category of protozoa. Uh, no, the protozoa
[28:42.170 --> 28:49.530]  or a specific, uh, I don't know what, I can't think the term right off of my head, but yeah,
[28:49.530 --> 28:53.890]  it's just a certain microbe that lives in the soil. All right. That's one that I'd never
[28:53.890 --> 28:57.930]  really, I'd seen the word, but I never paid attention until you opened my mind to it.
[28:57.930 --> 29:03.730]  Absolutely. I had a weren't so, uh, since we're on the subject, uh, we have been feeding
[29:03.730 --> 29:10.490]  our worms. We've been substituting alfalfa with cannabis. Um, yeah, we were donated a
[29:10.490 --> 29:15.650]  little over 3000 pounds of what we call canna meal, which is finally ground material from
[29:15.650 --> 29:21.690]  a local or actually I can open vape. Are you familiar with the company? They sell vapor
[29:21.690 --> 29:28.970]  pins and organo labs. They donated the material by law by state law. All dispensaries have
[29:28.970 --> 29:34.250]  to dispose of their waste. And unfortunately a lot of people are just mixing it with old
[29:34.250 --> 29:39.530]  dirt and throwing it in a dumpster and it's going to a landfill. Uh, we have been feeding
[29:39.530 --> 29:46.130]  it to our worms kind of as a test trial. Worms loved it. Uh, they really did. We just sent
[29:46.130 --> 29:53.210]  it or we just got our test results back, uh, today actually. And the, it was off the
[29:53.210 --> 29:58.730]  chart. I mean, it, it really was, let's see what we had on. He's searching. You guys give
[29:58.730 --> 30:01.730]  him a second, bear with him. He's digging through the iPhone. Always takes a minute.
[30:01.730 --> 30:06.450]  I mean the Rocky mountain worm company has definitely been the conversation at work for
[30:06.450 --> 30:10.850]  those most of the week. Anyways. Well, that's good to hear. Yeah. He, he really takes pride
[30:10.850 --> 30:16.810]  in what he does and he feeds his worms the highest quality, everything. And that seems
[30:16.810 --> 30:23.330]  to be the important part. It really is. You know, he, he, he makes them produce what you
[30:23.330 --> 30:28.250]  want. You know, everybody's so focused on cost. Everybody wants the cheapest casting
[30:28.250 --> 30:32.330]  out there and they don't really understand that you're only hurting yourself. You know,
[30:32.330 --> 30:35.690]  if you want, I keep saying if you're going to cut costs on the growth and cut the cost
[30:35.690 --> 30:39.130]  of the sale too, and they don't want to do that. They want to cut cost in one end and
[30:39.130 --> 30:46.130]  it's not fair. Yeah. And with these castings, um, you can take a compost and cut, you know,
[30:46.130 --> 30:51.690]  10 to 15% of the compost and then make your own vermicompost and then cut that in one
[30:51.690 --> 30:56.970]  part peat moss, one part aeration, one part vermicompost. There's your base soil. You
[30:56.970 --> 31:02.330]  can add in your amendments like your crab meal and your azomite and kelp and alfalfa,
[31:02.330 --> 31:08.450]  whatever you're going to add, you know, there's your mixed soil and it's really that simple.
[31:08.450 --> 31:14.450]  But, uh, Jay's been feeding his worms, uh, cannabis plant matter and they have been freaking
[31:14.450 --> 31:21.450]  loving it. Uh, test results were astronomical, uh, comparably to running the alfalfa. The
[31:21.450 --> 31:31.450]  biological life was off the charts. I mean, we gained hundreds of protozoa, fungi, bacteria,
[31:31.450 --> 31:38.690]  um, the active fungi, which means basically the things that are working in the soil. Um,
[31:38.690 --> 31:43.810]  before we had a higher fungal content, but that doesn't really mean much if they're not
[31:43.810 --> 31:47.810]  active. We have a lower fungal content, but more activity. Okay. That makes more sense.
[31:47.810 --> 31:52.130]  Oh, you want more bio life? Yeah. This stuff is so freaking biodiverse. It's amazing. We're
[31:52.130 --> 31:56.050]  so excited about it. So feeding it cannabis made it better. And now you're going to feed
[31:56.050 --> 32:00.770]  that to your cannabis and feed those leaves back to those worms. We're going to create
[32:01.090 --> 32:04.610]  a closed loop growing system. Yeah. I like that. A closed loop, self-sustainable system.
[32:05.170 --> 32:09.330]  And we all got to get away from the bottles. Um, I've been reading more about it since Sean kind
[32:09.330 --> 32:14.210]  of talked about it and we're paying for shipping and water. That's what we're paying a lot of.
[32:14.210 --> 32:19.170]  Yeah. I was looking at the general organics label today, just kind of going over what was
[32:19.170 --> 32:26.210]  in it and it's, it's pretty amazing. I mean, there's just so much stuff in the label for,
[32:26.210 --> 32:28.770]  and there's really not that much in the bottle. It's pretty amazing.
[32:28.770 --> 32:33.490]  They got to preserve it and they got to make it stable and it's got to be chelated or buffered or,
[32:33.490 --> 32:36.850]  yeah. And then it's got to be shipped and it's got to be able to stay in different temperatures.
[32:36.850 --> 32:40.770]  And it's got to have a shelf life. You could just make it yourself 24 hours before you,
[32:40.770 --> 32:45.570]  yeah. And then it's, you can smell it and it's so much richer. It really is. And then you're not
[32:45.570 --> 32:49.650]  throwing away plastic for all the neighbors to see your freaking botanic care bottles in the
[32:49.650 --> 32:54.210]  trash can. They don't need that. Um, so you talked about multiplying the protozoa.
[32:54.770 --> 32:58.130]  What's the best way to go about that? Uh, so basically you just need to give them a food
[32:58.130 --> 33:03.730]  source. So when you, um, when you give like mix your tea up, so you basically, what you're going
[33:03.730 --> 33:07.490]  to do is you're going to add in your worm castings and then you're going to put in your food source
[33:07.490 --> 33:10.690]  and that's going to be, I'm going to back up just for a second. We're using a five gallon bucket.
[33:10.690 --> 33:14.530]  Yeah. So five gallon bucket, like a nylon or something to keep all the stuff in. Oh,
[33:14.530 --> 33:19.890]  I preach free suspension teas, especially on a smaller scale. I mean, if you're not doing anything
[33:19.890 --> 33:23.810]  over 15 or 20 gallons, anything, throw all the shit right in there, just throw it right in there.
[33:24.370 --> 33:29.170]  And then stir it up and it's like top dressing. It goes on kind of need to bubble it, put a bubble
[33:29.170 --> 33:32.690]  year. You're going to want to bubble it. Five gallon bucket. You get your hopefully reverse
[33:32.690 --> 33:38.130]  osmosis water, uh, or at least, uh, let it bubble for a couple of days, get the air out and then put
[33:38.130 --> 33:42.770]  all your, uh, your worm castings, your molasses and whatever else you decide to put in there.
[33:42.770 --> 33:46.370]  Exactly. We can, you can expand on it as you please. We've talked about a lot of cool shit
[33:46.370 --> 33:49.410]  to put in there. I hope you're paying attention. Yeah, basically. Yeah. So you get your bucket,
[33:49.410 --> 33:53.170]  you get your air stones, the castings and molasses. You're going to throw that in there
[33:53.170 --> 33:57.970]  and you're going to just want to brew it from 12 to 24 hours. I really wouldn't recommend taking
[33:57.970 --> 34:01.650]  it anything over that. If you're not familiar with brewing, set it on something, you guys,
[34:01.650 --> 34:06.050]  it's going to bubble up and hopefully it's going to bubble up huge. And if you have a big problem
[34:06.050 --> 34:09.890]  with the foam, it's as simple as dropping a little bit of like coconut oil in there and then it's
[34:09.890 --> 34:15.090]  just gone. Nice. Sand did not know that. Yeah. I've made plenty of mess. I used to grow in like
[34:15.090 --> 34:20.770]  carpet and stuff like that. I've seen some of your pictures. Yeah. Yeah. So, all right. So we're,
[34:20.770 --> 34:24.050]  we just want to feed them and put them in a bucket and give them some oxygen and they will
[34:24.050 --> 34:28.290]  multiply. Do you know the ratio they multiply? Are we going to give them like 10,000 times or a
[34:28.290 --> 34:33.330]  thousand times more? You're going to get thousands and thousands of times. It's pretty amazing.
[34:33.330 --> 34:37.570]  Check out anybody who's listening that's interested in this, like Google microbe man,
[34:37.570 --> 34:44.610]  and he's got amazing articles about brew times and how you can, you know, take them longer for
[34:44.610 --> 34:48.770]  more fungal dominant teas, shorter times, more bacterial dominant teas, how you can actually
[34:51.010 --> 34:57.170]  kind of cook your or inoculate your ingredients for your compost tea to make it more fungal
[34:57.170 --> 35:02.210]  dominant. So you can take your earthworm castings and sprinkle in a little bit of oatmeal. Like,
[35:02.210 --> 35:07.650]  so let's say that you're going to use three cups. So I made, for example, I mixed a 15 gallon tea
[35:07.650 --> 35:14.130]  earlier. I use three and three quarters cups of worm castings. All right. And I knew I was going
[35:14.130 --> 35:17.490]  to use that much. So what I did is I took that three and three quarters cup of worm castings
[35:17.490 --> 35:23.730]  and put it in a Mason jar, added some O'Brien, sprayed it with a water bottle and sealed it up
[35:23.730 --> 35:28.370]  about two days ago. And then today I went down into my basement and cracked it open and it
[35:28.370 --> 35:35.090]  smelled sweet. It was covered in white, you know, bacteria. And I use that for my tea. And that's a
[35:35.090 --> 35:39.810]  way to fungal charge the shit out of your tea. Yeah. It sounds like it. Wow. That's pretty sweet.
[35:39.810 --> 35:43.570]  And cannabis plants love fungal dominance. And so that's going to make, instead of those
[35:43.570 --> 35:47.170]  little scraggly, shitty roots you see, it's going to make big, thick white spaghetti for
[35:47.170 --> 35:52.690]  roots, right? Exactly. I like to, you know, with the, when you do the free suspension teas and you
[35:52.690 --> 35:57.250]  kind of get messy, your drip trays will fill up with dirt. You know how it gets at the end of the
[35:57.250 --> 36:03.170]  day. And I've seen my roots will grow right into that dirt, the bottom of the pot. I mean, they
[36:03.170 --> 36:08.450]  just can't get enough of it. I'm definitely, I need to go. So the store is in Colorado Springs.
[36:08.450 --> 36:11.970]  I live about 45 minutes away from there. I'm going to plan a trip up there quite soon,
[36:12.610 --> 36:17.570]  here within the next week. I've got some freshly transplanted stuff that I want to feed some Rocky
[36:17.570 --> 36:22.850]  Mountain worm tea. You keep talking about azomite. Do I want, I've always thought of azomite as
[36:22.850 --> 36:26.690]  something I wanted to add during flower. Do I want that in my veg phase as well?
[36:26.690 --> 36:31.490]  You know, really it's just more for flower. If you're going to mix it in with your soil,
[36:31.490 --> 36:35.810]  which most people will do, or they'll have some sort of amendment similar in their soil.
[36:35.810 --> 36:40.370]  That makes sense. Yeah. So I really wouldn't recommend it until you're flowering, especially
[36:40.370 --> 36:46.450]  if you're not transplanting really. Yeah. Okay. All right. Yeah. These plants I'm doing now are
[36:46.450 --> 36:49.730]  going to finish in their little pots. Yeah. The azomite, I know a lot of people who will do
[36:50.530 --> 36:54.610]  worm castings, grow Kashi and azomite every two weeks as a top dress.
[36:54.610 --> 36:57.490]  I need to learn more about the Kashi. Everybody's all grow Kashi.
[36:57.490 --> 37:02.050]  Yeah. I think, I don't know. The grow Kashi is really cool, but I feel like a lot of people
[37:02.050 --> 37:06.450]  are using it just to use it. I don't know if they really understand what they're using it for.
[37:06.450 --> 37:15.330]  The idea is that it's lactic acid bacteria, it's photosynthetic bacteria, it's yeast. It's a lot of
[37:15.330 --> 37:20.610]  other things going on in there. And you're going to introduce that into your root zone, into your
[37:20.610 --> 37:27.970]  plant. And the grow Kashi will actually help digest old root parts and mats and things that are
[37:27.970 --> 37:33.330]  sitting in your soil kind of stagnant. Sort of like enzymes would. Exactly like enzymes would.
[37:33.730 --> 37:38.690]  I can show you how to kick that bottle though. It's as simple as sprouting some seeds.
[37:38.690 --> 37:42.050]  Okay. See, there's something else I'm going to learn. It's going to take me a little bit of time,
[37:42.050 --> 37:44.850]  but eventually I'm going to get away from all the bottled nutrients.
[37:44.850 --> 37:47.490]  It's a little overwhelming at first. It's funny because I taught Adam how to
[37:47.490 --> 37:51.330]  grow mostly with full bottled stuff and he's over there shaking his head like, I have to read that.
[37:51.330 --> 37:55.410]  I saw the seed process the other day and it just clicked.
[37:55.410 --> 38:01.250]  I compare it to like cooking. When you first start cooking and you look at recipes online and stuff,
[38:01.250 --> 38:08.210]  they're freaking overwhelming because there's so many things that go into it. But once you acquire,
[38:08.210 --> 38:13.730]  once your cabinet's filled with all those spices, it's nothing. It takes five minutes to
[38:14.450 --> 38:18.530]  whip up a meal. And it's the same thing with the tea is it's overwhelming at first, but once you
[38:18.530 --> 38:25.490]  have castings and molasses and kelp and hydroslate and everything that you use, it's really nothing.
[38:25.490 --> 38:29.490]  And then you're buying all those things in bulk. So you're getting them at a fraction of the cost.
[38:30.450 --> 38:32.130]  Without water weight for shipping too.
[38:32.130 --> 38:39.490]  Yeah. And you can buy everything locally between Jesse at Hydro and then Jay up at Rocky Mount Worm Company.
[38:39.490 --> 38:42.610]  There's absolutely no reason to buy anything online.
[38:42.610 --> 38:44.130]  When's a good time for me to drop in man?
[38:45.170 --> 38:47.730]  Monday through Friday. He's always up there.
[38:47.730 --> 38:48.050]  Cool.
[38:48.050 --> 38:48.690]  Midday.
[38:48.690 --> 38:52.770]  I like it. That's about my style. Monday through Friday, midday. I don't do things too damn early.
[38:53.970 --> 38:55.490]  Yeah. He's always up there.
[38:55.490 --> 38:58.370]  11 to 1. Lunchtime is when I do business.
[38:58.370 --> 39:02.370]  You need to stop up there and check out these can of castings. They're pretty freaking sweet, man.
[39:02.370 --> 39:03.410]  I'm excited about them.
[39:03.410 --> 39:06.130]  Yeah. I'll be up there really soon. I want to go get some stuff.
[39:06.690 --> 39:10.450]  Oh man. He sparked so many questions. So many questions. I'm not sure which one to pick.
[39:11.650 --> 39:14.130]  I'll choose one from a listener. I got to grab my phone again.
[39:14.130 --> 39:18.770]  I feel like I'm the wrong person in this damn chair. I feel like if Jesse was here right now,
[39:18.770 --> 39:22.690]  he would have been all in this conversation and I'm just sitting over here with my mouth open.
[39:22.690 --> 39:29.890]  And I'm like, oh, so that's great, man. I love hearing about this because I see it around in
[39:30.850 --> 39:33.090]  all the growing footage and shit.
[39:33.090 --> 39:37.650]  Part of my show is to bring the growers on your level and the growers on his level
[39:37.650 --> 39:42.930]  into one together because we're not different. I started first. You were playing guitar or being
[39:42.930 --> 39:47.650]  a skateboarder or you probably play Xbox way better than me. You might MMA fight.
[39:47.650 --> 39:50.770]  I was growing weed while you were doing that. I'll help you grow some weed. Hopefully when
[39:50.770 --> 39:53.730]  I want to learn how to MMA fight or some shit, you're down to teach me.
[39:53.730 --> 39:57.410]  I live back East. There was nobody that was willing to teach you. And, you know,
[39:59.090 --> 40:04.770]  I watched all the YouTube videos for many, many years. So now being able to see it firsthand and
[40:04.770 --> 40:06.930]  being able to have different styles.
[40:06.930 --> 40:11.330]  Yeah. When I let you trim the first time, I thought you had a boner. It was kind of weird.
[40:11.330 --> 40:15.970]  Yeah, I did until the dog. And then it was like, it got really weird.
[40:17.010 --> 40:19.730]  Yeah. Yeah. When I gave him that grateful dog, he went nuts.
[40:20.930 --> 40:24.530]  Stuff stunk so good. Wow. What happened? Oh, I know what's happening. I hope that doesn't
[40:24.530 --> 40:28.530]  really affect the podcast here because I'm getting a phone call and it's popping up on
[40:28.530 --> 40:32.210]  my computer because the new iOS, no, it's working. The new iOS eight likes to do that.
[40:33.490 --> 40:36.770]  But anyway, let's get back on track here. No, dude, I like having you on because you don't
[40:36.770 --> 40:41.170]  have to be a pro to be here. You might ask the one question that the listeners are wondering
[40:41.170 --> 40:45.090]  because we're Sean and I kind of know what we're saying. And we just, we get, I've been told that
[40:45.090 --> 40:49.010]  we're snobs and we just talk right over some points because we expect everyone to know.
[40:49.090 --> 40:54.610]  It happens. I mean, that wears off really well too. Like it's, it's just, I go home and she'll
[40:54.610 --> 40:58.530]  have like, Oh, this so-and-so gave us some bud. And I'm like, I don't, I don't want that. Yeah.
[40:58.530 --> 41:02.530]  I'm good. Now that you've seen some things, we've kind of opened Adam's eyes. When Adam
[41:02.530 --> 41:08.850]  first moved here, he would have smoked anything. I have smoked anything. Yeah. You know, that guy
[41:08.850 --> 41:13.570]  that cleans out your ashtray and smokes the stuff out of your ashtray. It'd totally be Adam. Adam
[41:13.650 --> 41:19.410]  will do that. Yep. All right. So we got to not anymore though. Uh, actually this is a Facebook
[41:19.410 --> 41:23.730]  comment from our good buddy, Fred, uh, Fred Garvin. Fred likes to comment and I appreciate it,
[41:23.730 --> 41:29.170]  dude. So this one says, ha ha shout out Jeff. Hey, episode 44 was rocking dude. I caught that tease
[41:29.170 --> 41:33.650]  about the next episode and map and DAP. I'm really interested in that. I know nothing about it except
[41:33.650 --> 41:38.850]  Cushman yammering on about it, uh, being bad on a couple other podcasts, but that's it. So I would
[41:38.850 --> 41:44.690]  like to know what it is. Is it bad? Is it in my Canada a and B cocoa? And if it is bad, what
[41:44.690 --> 41:49.810]  synthetic new line should I, should I slash we be looking at anyway, keep the shows coming and stay
[41:49.810 --> 41:54.690]  frosty, bro. And thanks for what you do. So first of all, I want to say, dude, thanks for freaking
[41:54.690 --> 41:59.090]  sending us messages, uh, participating and think and thanking us for what we do. Like I said earlier,
[41:59.090 --> 42:02.290]  that means a lot. Yeah, that was awesome. That was a really weird echo. Would you catch that?
[42:02.290 --> 42:05.810]  Yeah. Something went digital on me. That's cool. It's back though. Yeah. Thanks for the question.
[42:06.130 --> 42:09.970]  So that's a question for Sean. You were talking about mapping. Yeah. So mapping DAP is, uh,
[42:09.970 --> 42:13.170]  see if I can say this, right. It's mono ammonium phosphate and
[42:13.890 --> 42:19.970]  dio potassium phosphate or something similar to that. I'll give it to you. Yeah. Um, but basically,
[42:19.970 --> 42:29.890]  yeah, they're, uh, they're chemicals that are used in basically every single hydro product or
[42:29.890 --> 42:38.530]  synthetic nutrient product on the shelf. Uh, they're synthetic salts. Uh, the big problem
[42:38.530 --> 42:44.290]  with them, uh, in my opinion is they don't flush out of plants. I, you know, I don't think that
[42:44.290 --> 42:49.090]  you can get them out, uh, heavy metals and things like that are stored in the trichome.
[42:49.090 --> 42:53.410]  So once you kind of get them in there, there's no way to get them out.
[42:53.410 --> 42:57.170]  And if you're blasting, you're blasting those heavy metals into your mix.
[42:57.170 --> 43:01.250]  Exactly. And that's a, you know, I kind of mentioned azomite a couple of times and azomite
[43:01.250 --> 43:05.810]  is one of the things that's filled with heavy metals. So you really want to be liberal. You
[43:05.810 --> 43:10.610]  don't want to use too much of that stuff. Uh, glacial rock dust filled with heavy metals.
[43:10.610 --> 43:17.890]  So it's not just, uh, synthetics, you know, that are filled with these things, but mono, uh, map
[43:17.890 --> 43:23.170]  and DAP are probably the worst of all, uh, just in the simple fact that they're the most common
[43:23.170 --> 43:27.970]  and it's easy. It's something easy to look out for. And I'm not telling you to like a run away
[43:27.970 --> 43:33.890]  from the map and DAP, but it's, if you're somebody who's interested in a cleaner product,
[43:33.890 --> 43:39.250]  something that's a little bit more organic, uh, the, you know, you need to become familiar with
[43:39.250 --> 43:43.250]  the terms that you need to look out for. And those are some of them. You know, if you're
[43:43.250 --> 43:49.970]  looking for a nice organic product, look for something with like a soybean meal or kelp or
[43:49.970 --> 43:55.090]  alfalfa or brewer's yeast or soul synthetics offers stuff like, yeah. Solus synthetics is a
[43:55.090 --> 44:00.770]  killer line. So good. Yeah. Biobiz is especially if he's running Canada. I mean, if you're running
[44:00.770 --> 44:06.770]  Canada, then, you know, bio-biz is a organic nutrient line. That's very similar style of
[44:06.770 --> 44:13.490]  growing, uh, really high quality stuff, uh, or grown on Instagram. I don't know if everybody
[44:13.490 --> 44:19.090]  probably follows that guy. He straight crushes it all by a biz. Um, I don't know if he really
[44:19.090 --> 44:23.010]  talks about what he uses, but a lot of us don't talk about it on the, on the Instagram feed.
[44:23.010 --> 44:26.610]  I'm going to call him out because he's got amazing shit and he's using organics and he
[44:26.610 --> 44:30.530]  deserves to be called out on it. If you use organics and getting good progress, that's,
[44:30.530 --> 44:35.650]  yeah. So you have to be noted. Congratulations on that one. But yeah, the bio-biz is a really good
[44:35.650 --> 44:41.730]  one to use, uh, general organics. That's, you know, that's another one to use. That's really
[44:41.730 --> 44:48.850]  good, but you know, to each his own, I don't use things like that. There's what's the big one on
[44:48.850 --> 44:54.450]  the market right now? Moab. Yeah. The mother of all blues. You know, you know what Moab is,
[44:54.450 --> 45:01.730]  is just map. If you look in the ingredients, it's like 99.9% map. So I'm not going to sit here and
[45:01.730 --> 45:06.370]  tell you that it's like going to kill you or it's bad for you, but it's one of the things you want
[45:06.370 --> 45:11.010]  to look out for if you're an organic grower. So it's just printed on the bottle as mono ammonium
[45:11.010 --> 45:15.650]  phosphate. Yes. Okay. So if you're looking for it, that's map and DAP is the dio-
[45:15.650 --> 45:19.650]  ammonium phosphate. It's very similar. Yeah. So if you're trying to avoid that,
[45:19.650 --> 45:26.210]  that those are the two to stray from. And, uh, I know I'm just parroting what Cushman says,
[45:26.210 --> 45:29.650]  but Cushman says that that's often what gives you, when you smoke good weed and for some reason you
[45:29.650 --> 45:33.170]  get a headache and you're like, but that was good herb. Why did it give me a headache? It had map
[45:33.170 --> 45:38.370]  and DAP residuals in it. I can't prove that, but that's what Cushman has led me to believe from
[45:38.370 --> 45:42.850]  everything he has said. And I mostly trust Cushman. There's no reason not to trust Cushman,
[45:42.850 --> 45:48.050]  in my opinion. He smokes a lot. No, he's, he's the, he's kicking ass and taking names with his
[45:48.050 --> 45:54.210]  veganics right now. He's won a couple of cups. Um, so he really knows what the plant wants.
[45:54.210 --> 45:59.170]  Yeah. I'll take his word for it. Yeah. Uh, do you recycle your soil? Yes. Did I ask you that
[45:59.170 --> 46:04.690]  on the last episode? Uh, yeah, I don't, I don't like to recycle my soil. I really don't. I do it
[46:04.690 --> 46:11.650]  because it's cheap. I really don't. If I recycle my soil, I like to use it as a, in my veggie garden,
[46:11.650 --> 46:19.010]  but I just, I haven't mastered that yet. Okay. Um, I always see a loss in yield, no matter what
[46:19.010 --> 46:23.650]  I do. I've blamed it on other things and haven't attributed it to that. I always think that these
[46:23.650 --> 46:29.570]  worm castings are going to help me out fix that problem. Yeah. And I, and I'm having better luck,
[46:29.570 --> 46:34.690]  uh, starting with sterile medias. You know, I used to run like happy frog and roots and stuff like
[46:34.690 --> 46:41.010]  that, uh, switched it up to more of like a pro mix base. Got a lot better results out of that.
[46:41.010 --> 46:47.010]  Now I'm running my own like vermicompost, peat moss and buckwheat hole with amendments and stuff,
[46:47.010 --> 46:53.090]  but the pro mix and stuff, I'm getting better results with reusing the soil. It's a lot easier
[46:53.090 --> 46:59.090]  to amend it at the beginning. It being a sterile media. Um, I can write down how much of what I put
[46:59.090 --> 47:04.530]  into it. And basically if my plant doesn't show a deficiency throughout that cycle, I just remand
[47:04.530 --> 47:11.650]  everything like I would, you know, a brand new soil mix and grow right back into it. Whereas,
[47:11.650 --> 47:17.250]  you know, running the Fox farm and the roots organic, I feel like with the guanos and the
[47:17.250 --> 47:22.530]  blood meals and everything that's already in there, plus me amending it by the end of the cycle,
[47:23.090 --> 47:28.130]  sure the might not have been of any deficiencies, but I really don't know where that soil's at.
[47:28.290 --> 47:36.290]  Yeah. Okay. So that's kind of where I'm at with reusing soil, uh, using mix. So this is kind of
[47:36.290 --> 47:40.530]  what I found to do with, I've been doing with my soil lately. So I take it and mix it with the
[47:40.530 --> 47:47.410]  stuff out of my Bukashi bucket. Uh, like all of the slimy leftover pickled trash that ends up in
[47:47.410 --> 47:51.250]  your Bukashi bucket. So I just mix it in with my soil and it's kind of, it looks like you're
[47:51.250 --> 47:57.010]  making him hungry. You do that shit. I'm not doing that. I'm not doing that. So you just dump it out
[47:57.010 --> 48:01.810]  into your, uh, you know, into like a Rubbermaid container and fill it up with dirt and then just
[48:01.810 --> 48:07.250]  let it sit. And then basically we'll, you know, in a couple of weeks or a month or two or whenever
[48:07.250 --> 48:12.450]  I get around to going back to those buckets, um, it'll be compost. And then I'll mix that with worm
[48:12.450 --> 48:19.250]  castings and use that as a vermicompost for my soil. So I use it up a lot of space, aren't you?
[48:19.250 --> 48:24.770]  Uh, not really. I just picture a lot of space when I'm thinking about this. I have a garage
[48:24.770 --> 48:31.090]  and I don't park my car in it. Yeah. So that's where I'm storing everything. I do crazy shit.
[48:31.090 --> 48:35.410]  So other people don't have to, if you've had any like weird experiments you want to try and you
[48:35.410 --> 48:40.050]  don't have the space, just email Jeff and he'll let me know. Yeah, there we go. And I also have
[48:40.050 --> 48:45.010]  a friend in California who wants your bugs. Yeah. Uh, yeah. If you've got a plant with bugs, he
[48:45.010 --> 48:48.850]  wants you to clip off a leaf of that or a branch of that plant and send it to him so that he can
[48:48.850 --> 48:52.530]  play with the bugs. That's his specialty. That's cool. Yeah. Tree town. What's up, bro? I hope
[48:52.530 --> 48:57.410]  you're listening. Tree town farmer. Yeah. I met a guy at the cup who does something similar with
[48:57.410 --> 49:03.090]  microscopes. He's been through a couple of Elaine Ingram courses and he's like, yeah, send me your
[49:03.090 --> 49:08.530]  soil. Send me your tea. We'll get them looked at. Yeah. Some people are hardcore. You've got to find
[49:08.530 --> 49:13.570]  your niche. Yeah. Yeah. That's the truth. Adam's a good little, uh, transplanter and grunt worker.
[49:13.570 --> 49:17.490]  He does some shit in the gardens. I just worked to get it done. I walked in the room and him and
[49:17.490 --> 49:21.330]  this other dude had dirt flying three feet in the air and all of it was landing into pots. I don't
[49:21.330 --> 49:26.130]  know how it was working. I don't know if Mike knew what to think about that. No, that's all right.
[49:26.130 --> 49:30.690]  No, you definitely work at a different pace than what Mike's doing. He picked up, he picked up.
[49:31.890 --> 49:35.810]  Uh, what should I not use in my organics? That's going to be my last question for the day.
[49:35.810 --> 49:41.970]  Uh, you know, it's depends on your level of like, you know, your dedication to organics. But the
[49:41.970 --> 49:48.050]  first thing that I would kick out would be blood meal and bone meal. Uh, if you really care about
[49:48.050 --> 49:54.690]  organics, chances are you don't eat GMOs and you don't eat, I'm not going to say you're vegetarian
[49:54.690 --> 50:00.130]  if you're, you know, if you're into organics and stuff, but those things are byproducts of like the
[50:00.930 --> 50:05.570]  slaughterhouse industry, feather meals, a byproduct of the poultry industry, all of it.
[50:05.570 --> 50:11.090]  And they have their place. Don't get me wrong because I'd rather than be recycled into
[50:11.090 --> 50:15.970]  agricultural byproducts for farm and other agricultural uses. But when it comes to growing
[50:15.970 --> 50:21.010]  medicine for people, I don't believe that feather meal made from chickens that were fed,
[50:21.010 --> 50:25.570]  you know, antibiotics and hormones should be used to grow it. Same thing with the blood that
[50:25.570 --> 50:30.210]  scraped off the slaughterhouse floor to make the blood meal. It's just this gelatinous goo filled
[50:30.210 --> 50:35.730]  with everything that there was in that cow, uh, bone meal, same gig. So if you're going to use
[50:35.730 --> 50:39.570]  things like that, I would just recommend there's other alternatives. You can use things like fish,
[50:39.570 --> 50:45.330]  blood meal, alfalfa, kelp. I mean, there's a lot of plant baits. Um, if you really want to get into
[50:45.330 --> 50:50.850]  it, comfrey and burdock root and nettle and dandelions and, you know, go out in the woods
[50:50.850 --> 50:56.050]  and pick a bunch of shit, am I going to come back from the Rocky mountain worm company with a whole
[50:56.050 --> 51:00.530]  backseat full of brand new shit and rethink my whole growing method the first time I go in here?
[51:00.530 --> 51:04.050]  You probably will. And the cool thing is, is you're going to, you'll probably see a couple
[51:04.050 --> 51:09.010]  of things that you've seen at Jesse's shop too. And when you see those, you know, might click
[51:09.010 --> 51:13.250]  with you and be like, well, maybe I should pick those up next time. You know, shout out to, if
[51:13.250 --> 51:18.930]  you're going to be going up to Jay's check out the C crop. Uh, that's a little secret product
[51:18.930 --> 51:23.010]  that I use in my garden. I was gifted by Jay a long time ago. I think you're the second one to
[51:23.010 --> 51:27.170]  tell you about that. It is awesome. Yeah, it really is. I think our buddy Spence had some
[51:27.170 --> 51:31.810]  of that. Does he really, he might've picked it or Jay might've given him some of it or I don't know,
[51:31.810 --> 51:38.290]  but I use it to basically replace my full power. Uh, or if you're, if anybody out there is familiar
[51:38.370 --> 51:42.850]  with full power or full of the gas or you can make acid. I use it. Yeah. And replace in place
[51:42.850 --> 51:46.930]  of that. Okay. Uh, there's scientific studies. I hope you'll be there when I go. Yeah. The fun
[51:46.930 --> 51:50.770]  goal. Oh yeah. Just give me a call. I'll be up there. I'll meet you. Cool. Yeah. I'm not sure
[51:50.770 --> 51:53.570]  when I'm going yet, but I'm always looking for an excuse to get up to the screen. I'm going to
[51:53.570 --> 51:57.010]  go find one more gift for the girlfriend. So I got to sneak away while she's at work and sneak up
[51:57.010 --> 52:01.090]  there and get some warm castings. One more gift for her. Speaking of gifts, if you guys want to
[52:01.090 --> 52:06.370]  get a cool gift for somebody, come and get the, like a Bukashi bucket, a worm, you know, home
[52:06.370 --> 52:12.290]  worm farm guys. I need one of those. Can I ship it to Australia? Hope your grower be more
[52:12.290 --> 52:17.810]  self-sufficient. Come by Rocky mountain worm company. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, Rocky mountain worm
[52:17.810 --> 52:21.570]  company. They listened to the podcast cause they said they liked it. Hey guys, uh, I'm going to
[52:21.570 --> 52:25.250]  come get some warm castings and we should talk about some sponsorship sort of stuff because
[52:25.250 --> 52:30.530]  people seem to be responding to you and I want to support semi-local shit. Your Colorado, your
[52:30.530 --> 52:33.970]  Colorado Springs. That's not Pueblo, but I still love it. I'd like to support that. Let's see if
[52:33.970 --> 52:39.090]  we can do something. I'll brag about worm castings and you supply me with worm castings.
[52:39.090 --> 52:43.410]  I think they might be more than happy to work with you, man. Yeah. They're big fans. They love
[52:43.410 --> 52:46.450]  it. Cool. I appreciate that. Well, they're doing a great thing. I'm excited to get in there and
[52:46.450 --> 52:52.290]  learn about it. Um, and we've got 55, 53 minutes. Let's start closing up the show, dude. I gotta
[52:52.290 --> 52:55.730]  have you back on more. I like what you, we get sidetracked cause we're potheads, but I like
[52:55.730 --> 53:01.730]  having you on and you have a lot of useful shit to share with us. Yeah. Yeah. And send anybody who
[53:01.730 --> 53:07.490]  has any questions, uh, send them to Jeff and get them to send them to me. We'll have them ready
[53:07.490 --> 53:13.410]  next time and we'll just, we'll just slam through them. But yeah, I'm fucking high. Yeah. We took
[53:13.410 --> 53:19.490]  solventless dabs. We took the live resin dabs. We took shatter dabs. Uh, Adam looks dabbed. Yeah.
[53:19.490 --> 53:24.770]  I feel like I'm just tired as fuck, man. This delicious yerba mate is keeping me up. Yeah.
[53:24.770 --> 53:29.330]  Shout out to the, uh, the mate factor. Also a big shout out to sweet Angela for getting me
[53:29.330 --> 53:34.210]  addicted to the yerba mate. I love you babe, but Jesus mate, I don't know what you've done to me.
[53:34.210 --> 53:41.330]  You've created a monster. Mate is so great. The best idea we had though was buying bags to bring
[53:41.330 --> 53:44.930]  it home and make it. So now we don't have to drive to our favorite mate spot in Colorado
[53:44.930 --> 53:49.010]  spring or in Manitou Springs every time we want mate because we would do so. Yeah. But it's a
[53:49.010 --> 53:53.250]  great excuse to get up there. The place is freaking awesome. Ah, I hate to say it. I'm
[53:53.250 --> 53:57.810]  more comfortable in Manitou Springs than I am here in Pueblo. It's starting to get bad here, man.
[53:57.810 --> 54:02.290]  It is kind of, yeah, it's a little gangster here, but I have, I feel like I have more friends that
[54:02.290 --> 54:06.770]  are more open to go do shit in Manitou. Nobody wants to go out of their house here because it's,
[54:06.770 --> 54:11.410]  it's weird here. There's nothing to really go have fun at. You can't go walk in Manitou. You
[54:11.410 --> 54:17.170]  can just go walk and enjoy the day. Shout out to Manitou Springs. That's a fun time. Yeah, it is.
[54:17.170 --> 54:21.410]  Um, anybody got any shout outs? Anybody you want to say you love to, you love them, anybody,
[54:21.410 --> 54:25.810]  anything like that? You guys, it's the boy's birthday. It's the boy's birthday. Happy birthday.
[54:25.810 --> 54:30.530]  Little, little miniature Adam. I've seen pictures of him on Facebook riding a skateboard and shit,
[54:30.530 --> 54:34.130]  bro. He's going to be just like you when he grows up. Yeah. We got him a Genesis. I want to give a
[54:34.130 --> 54:37.970]  shout out to my girl Kelly for holding it down while I was in California. She took care of the
[54:37.970 --> 54:43.810]  grow and kept the plants healthy and I know she was pissed that I left. So I love you, baby. Sorry
[54:43.810 --> 54:48.210]  about that. I'm constantly trying to talk to my wife and it just learning that like the ability
[54:48.210 --> 54:53.810]  to take care of something. If you walk in there and go, why is everything all droopy? They, they,
[54:54.450 --> 54:59.330]  they take in a lot more than they let on. Like I never thought that my girl could do it, but you,
[54:59.330 --> 55:03.650]  you know, given the chance, you could probably make a tea better than most. What's up queen Cola.
[55:03.650 --> 55:06.610]  It's been a long time since I've seen you. Hope you're doing well. We used to take dabs together
[55:06.610 --> 55:09.330]  over at Maddie's. That was fun. Hope you're all right. Hope you're doing well. Hope you're
[55:09.330 --> 55:13.410]  smiling. Good job on holding down the plants. I got to give a shout out to my chick. If we're
[55:13.410 --> 55:17.650]  talking about that, my chick knows her way around the garden, bro. Uh, if I need anything done,
[55:17.650 --> 55:21.650]  she can definitely do it. Oh, here goes my phone again. Dude. I just mentioned her. She started
[55:21.650 --> 55:27.170]  calling like rumble. Still. Yeah. All right. Adam, uh, you shouted out the boy. Anybody else?
[55:27.170 --> 55:32.370]  Uh, just bender, man. Running the servers. Yeah. Running the servers. Jesse, Jesse. Yeah,
[55:32.370 --> 55:37.730]  dude. Just paid my bills, brother. Like, but you don't work too. So, you know, I'm, I'm there
[55:37.730 --> 55:45.250]  busting my butt, but it's just, yeah. Thank you. Wow. Phone ringing. Oh, nice. Got off work early.
[55:45.250 --> 55:49.490]  We might have some food. Cool. Let's wrap up the show. Uh, now the show's over. Please go to iTunes

[56:52.930 --> 56:57.410]  mentioned some things from the hydro shop. There'll be an iRegenetics t-shirt in there,
[56:57.410 --> 57:01.730]  maybe a hat pin. We'll see what we've got available. Maybe some a Jenny Kush prizes
[57:01.730 --> 57:05.090]  that I've had around for a while that nobody claimed back in the day. I've got a Jenny Kush
[57:05.090 --> 57:08.290]  pin that needs a home. Anyway, guys, keep listening to the show. I really appreciate
[57:08.290 --> 57:11.650]  you for hanging out. Big shout out to my ninja Spence. He taught me how to make hash today.
[57:11.650 --> 57:17.170]  You teach a man to fish, bro. Oh man. Yeah. It's on now. Game on. Big shout out to you guys for
[57:17.170 --> 57:21.090]  coming out. These guys will be back on the show. Yeah. Thanks for having me. Thanks again for
[57:21.090 --> 57:27.010]  listening to you guys until next time. Take a fat dab. Give your mom a hug for me.
