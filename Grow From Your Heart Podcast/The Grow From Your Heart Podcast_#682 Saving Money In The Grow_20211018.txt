[02:10.680 --> 02:16.520]  main topic of this podcast. I try not to brag about all the amazing shit that I get to do but since
[02:16.520 --> 02:21.240]  the world has opened up and we're having fun again. I want to share an experience that I had a
[02:21.240 --> 02:27.760]  few nights ago. On Sunday, Doug Benson headlined Comedy Works in Denver, Colorado. Of course, you
[02:27.760 --> 02:32.280]  know, that Comedy Works is my favorite comedy club on the planet. I think that is the best club on
[02:32.280 --> 02:36.920]  the planet, the downtown club in Denver. They've got a great staff, they've got an amazing owner.
[02:37.320 --> 02:41.960]  They've got an amazing stage, a great club, and the acts that they bring are always top notch. Of
[02:41.960 --> 02:45.960]  course, if you've been listening for a while, you know that Doug Benson is my homie, that should be
[02:45.960 --> 02:50.320]  a bumper sticker. Doug Benson is my homie, somebody make it happen. But Doug Benson is my friend,
[02:50.320 --> 02:55.320]  we've been hanging out for quite a while. I've seen a lot of Doug Benson shows. The majority, I
[02:55.320 --> 03:01.760]  think almost all of them were at the Comedy Works downtown. But Doug Benson came to Denver and he did
[03:01.760 --> 03:07.960]  a show at Comedy Works and he did a great show. Big shout out to my buddy Baker. I have a friend, my
[03:07.960 --> 03:12.000]  buddy Clint usually goes to comedy shows with me. He's my comedy buddy. We're both comedy nerds.
[03:12.160 --> 03:16.080]  Clint was busy that day, so I invited my buddy Baker who lives in Denver.
[03:16.080 --> 03:21.840]  Denver is a, Baker is a former employee of the Comedy Works, so everybody there knows Baker.
[03:21.840 --> 03:25.600]  Everybody there knows me because I'm a regular, I'm there every week. It was a really good time
[03:25.600 --> 03:30.320]  walking in with Baker. My buddy Doug Benson came out on stage. I did chat with Doug a little bit
[03:30.320 --> 03:34.640]  before the show. We did some tweeting, we did some talking. He chose not to smoke with people this
[03:34.640 --> 03:38.160]  time. If you know Doug, you know he is a big smoker. He usually hangs out with the crowd
[03:38.800 --> 03:43.280]  because of the quarantine conditions, because of COVID. He's chosen to protect himself. He wasn't
[03:43.280 --> 03:47.840]  smoking with anybody. I chose to respect that. So we didn't hang out before the show like normal,
[03:47.840 --> 03:51.680]  but when he walked on stage, he made sure to wave to me. He made me stand up and show the
[03:51.680 --> 03:55.840]  crowd my dreadlocks. That was a little bit interesting. He realized my buddy Baker was
[03:55.840 --> 03:59.520]  the guy sitting next to me eventually. And he's like, oh, hey dude, didn't realize that was you.
[03:59.520 --> 04:05.920]  That was kind of funny. But at the end of the show, I tried not to impose on Doug Benson. I
[04:06.080 --> 04:10.080]  wanted some privacy, but I was invited to go say hello after I popped into the green room,
[04:10.080 --> 04:15.440]  said hello. Then I quickly excused myself. I knew Doug was trying to protect himself and not try to
[04:15.440 --> 04:19.520]  get sick and not be around a lot of people. So I threw a fist bump. I threw some high fives and I
[04:19.520 --> 04:24.800]  said, hey, it's crowded in the green room. I'm out of here. There was a young man in that green room
[04:24.800 --> 04:28.960]  who we're not going to get too political, but he's not into the mask thing. He finds it silly.
[04:28.960 --> 04:34.800]  That's not what he's doing. So when I politely excused myself from the green room, shortly after
[04:34.800 --> 04:39.680]  that, he came out to smoke with me since everybody smoking in the green room was kind of a mask
[04:39.680 --> 04:44.480]  person. So the guy that followed me outside and ended up smoking a big 14 gram joint of the cream
[04:44.480 --> 04:49.680]  with me was this comedian you might've seen on TV. His name was Josh Blue. That was a really
[04:49.680 --> 04:54.960]  good experience because I excused myself from that green room and tried not to impose and mix
[04:54.960 --> 05:00.320]  myself up into that crowd. I ended up smoking a big fat joint with Josh Blue. Sometimes life just
[05:00.320 --> 05:04.560]  works itself out for you. That was a blessing. Josh Blue, of course, was just on America's Got
[05:04.560 --> 05:10.320]  Talent. He is the comedian with cerebral palsy. Not trying to be rude, but if you ever pass a
[05:10.320 --> 05:14.960]  joint to a guy with cerebral palsy, be fucking patient trying to get that thing back. I had to
[05:14.960 --> 05:19.200]  chase it down. That's just a joke. I'd sit in front of him. He makes fun of his palsy arm.
[05:19.200 --> 05:22.960]  It's fucking hilarious. But really, you had to chase it down. His palsy arm just went out of
[05:22.960 --> 05:26.000]  control and he had the joint in the palsy arm. I'm like, well, no, I'm never getting the fucking
[05:26.000 --> 05:30.000]  joint back. Had to chase it. That was a funny joke. I looked him right in the eye and shook my
[05:30.240 --> 05:35.840]  you motherfucker. You put it in that hand because he knew better. I'm not sure if he was fucking
[05:35.840 --> 05:40.160]  with me or if his palsy arm was out of control and that joint was just going everywhere. Anyway,
[05:40.160 --> 05:44.880]  big up to Josh Blue. That was a great experience. Something I want to mention. A long time ago,
[05:44.880 --> 05:50.000]  I did a podcast talking about seeing Doug Benson. I said that Doug Benson pulled out
[05:50.000 --> 05:55.440]  a bunch of papers called, and I called it a handful of grandpa. If you see Doug Benson again,
[05:55.440 --> 05:59.920]  you're going to laugh at the handful of grandpa if he's still doing one of the bits that I saw him
[05:59.920 --> 06:04.240]  do. I'm not going to blow his act at all, but handful of grandpa. Just go see Doug Benson and
[06:04.240 --> 06:07.840]  laugh when that happens. All right. That's enough bragging about comedy. I just wanted to share
[06:07.840 --> 06:11.200]  with you guys what I do. Sometimes it's fun to bring you into my world. Some people are going
[06:11.200 --> 06:14.960]  to say I'm bragging. Some people are going to say, thanks for hanging out. Big up to both of you.
[06:14.960 --> 06:21.040]  Thank you both for watching. All right. Now let's focus more on cannabis growing, ganja production,
[06:21.040 --> 06:24.640]  a cannabis consumption podcast. I'm scrolling through my notes trying to get myself on track
[06:24.640 --> 06:28.480]  here. Big shout out to Doug Benson. Big shout out to Comedy Works. Big shout out to Baker.
[06:28.480 --> 06:32.400]  Big shout out to Josh Blue. Big shout out to the Opening Acts. Big shout out to everybody
[06:32.400 --> 06:37.280]  who made Sunday an amazing day. Let's keep moving. I do have a big topic here. Let's talk about
[06:37.280 --> 06:44.080]  cannabis growing. Let's talk about a few ways to save you money in your grow space. I do offer
[06:44.080 --> 06:49.760]  professional commercial cultivation consulting services. One of the things that I talk about
[06:49.760 --> 06:54.160]  when I go to a commercial cultivation to do a consultation, those are a lot of words together,
[06:54.160 --> 07:00.080]  but when I go to do that, one of the things I focus on is increasing productivity or reducing
[07:00.080 --> 07:06.720]  costs by about 30%. I know I can save some money. I know I can increase costs. Can I do both enough
[07:06.720 --> 07:12.640]  to increase productivity and reduce costs by 30%? That is a huge goal in a commercial facility. If
[07:12.640 --> 07:17.600]  you can increase productivity by 30%, that's 30% more money you're going to make, which will really
[07:17.600 --> 07:22.640]  help out. Right now, a lot of commercial facilities in Colorado, we're barely scraping even. So we've
[07:22.640 --> 07:28.000]  got to make every dollar count. This also counts when you're working in your own home grow. If
[07:28.000 --> 07:32.480]  you've got one light, if you've got four lights, if you've got a 12 lighter in your garage, however
[07:32.480 --> 07:38.080]  you're doing it, every dollar counts, especially in the situation we are in. I don't know how the
[07:38.080 --> 07:42.240]  pandemic treated you. Maybe you made some money. Maybe you went broke. Maybe you're scraping by.
[07:42.240 --> 07:46.720]  It doesn't matter. Everybody can save a few bucks. If you have money and you save a few bucks,
[07:46.720 --> 07:51.040]  you have more money. If you barely have any money and you save a few bucks, maybe you can use those
[07:51.040 --> 07:56.240]  dollars to improve on something in your life or in your garden. So let me get my high ass on track
[07:56.240 --> 08:02.720]  and let's talk about some ways to save money in your grow space. First of all, in a commercial
[08:02.720 --> 08:08.320]  environment, one of the things I focus on is, is your building the appropriate size? Did you buy a
[08:08.320 --> 08:12.640]  big ass warehouse thinking you're going to load it up with lights and plants, and then you're only
[08:12.640 --> 08:19.120]  using a small portion of that? Real estate is expensive. Space is expensive. Every square foot
[08:19.120 --> 08:24.640]  of your cultivation space costs you money. Use it. If you're not using it, you are wasting space.
[08:24.640 --> 08:29.920]  That is a big void. Do you want to, if I gave you a cooler and I said, put weed in the cooler,
[08:29.920 --> 08:33.600]  are you going to put weed in some of the space in that cooler? Are you going to fill the whole
[08:33.600 --> 08:38.000]  cooler with weed? Do that with your grow environment. Fill that bitch up or you are
[08:38.000 --> 08:43.120]  wasting space. Maximize your output. Of course you do need processing area, trimming area,
[08:43.120 --> 08:47.280]  working area, but you get the point. If you've got some dark area or room that's not even being
[08:47.280 --> 08:51.920]  used, if you're storing shit in there just because it's empty, utilize that room. Do something with
[08:51.920 --> 08:58.560]  it. Make it pay for itself. Real estate square footage is expensive, and that matters in any
[08:58.560 --> 09:03.120]  grow. If you're running a commercial grow, a five by five tent, a three by three tent,
[09:03.120 --> 09:08.400]  be economical. Be cost effective with your space. Use every square foot of space that you've got.
[09:08.400 --> 09:13.760]  You paid for it. Even if it's a tent, you bought a five by five tent, use the five by five. I see
[09:13.760 --> 09:18.160]  people setting up a trellis in a five by five, and they're allowed to grow three plants or four
[09:18.160 --> 09:22.240]  plants in their legal location, so they'll put four plants in there, but they don't veg it out
[09:22.240 --> 09:27.120]  to fill that tent. Even if you're running a three by three, fill it up. If you're running a five by
[09:27.120 --> 09:33.360]  five, fill it up. Veg long enough to utilize that space. I see a lot of wasted space in a lot of
[09:33.360 --> 09:38.000]  grow tents. Think of it this way. Sometimes it's illegal where people are growing. Are you going
[09:38.000 --> 09:42.640]  to grow just enough to get by, or are you going to grow enough to fucking make it worth it? Because
[09:42.640 --> 09:46.880]  if you get in trouble, you're getting in trouble either way. If you've got a plant and it's kind of
[09:46.880 --> 09:50.240]  this big, or if you've got a plant that's this fucking big and it's in your house, it's going to
[09:50.240 --> 09:56.320]  be the same charge. Go big or go the fuck home and make it worth it. Fill your space. Real estate is
[09:56.320 --> 10:01.040]  one of the number one things that I see people wasting in any grow. Fill your tent. Fill your
[10:01.040 --> 10:06.480]  commercial grow. Then another thing that I see when those rooms are filled, they're only filled
[10:06.480 --> 10:11.200]  with lights. They're not filled with plants, and the lights are running. Just like your mama says,
[10:11.200 --> 10:15.040]  just like your dad says, if that light isn't on for a reason, turn it the fuck off. If you're not
[10:15.040 --> 10:19.920]  in that room, turn the light off. If there are not plants underneath that light, turn the light off.
[10:19.920 --> 10:24.480]  Why is that light running for no plants? It looks cool. Yeah, you got the whole room lit up. All the
[10:24.480 --> 10:28.400]  workspace is bright. It looks like a big productivity area, but you're just burning
[10:28.400 --> 10:33.200]  lumens, wasting your bulb, running electricity. The kilowatts are just spinning on the meter outside.
[10:33.200 --> 10:37.840]  You're not getting anything from it except a little bit more heat. You're running lights that
[10:37.840 --> 10:42.240]  are unnecessary. You're creating more heat, which means you need to run more fans, which will also
[10:42.240 --> 10:46.320]  mean you probably need more air conditioning, which are all sucking more kilowatts that you
[10:46.320 --> 10:51.840]  don't need. Think about the equipment you do not need that's running right now and turn it off.
[10:52.400 --> 10:57.200]  Maybe you've got plants too far apart. I like the plants to have some space. They need some
[10:57.200 --> 11:01.280]  breathing room. They don't need to be crowded, but do you have plants too far spread apart
[11:01.280 --> 11:06.400]  unnecessarily to where you've got extra lights on? Can you possibly turn off that row of lights,
[11:06.400 --> 11:10.960]  move all those plants over and wait for them to grow a little bit? And then when they're bigger,
[11:10.960 --> 11:16.000]  then we'll use more light. That may be something that you're not thinking about. Something else to
[11:16.000 --> 11:20.960]  think about, move the plants closer together. That's easier to do if you are using smaller
[11:20.960 --> 11:26.400]  pots or you're using the right size pot. I like to use graduated pot sizes, which means I start
[11:26.400 --> 11:30.400]  off in a... So you go from a cloner, right? You got your clone domes or your clone. However many of
[11:30.400 --> 11:34.400]  those fucking cram those under a light. As soon as they go into the small pots, you can get them
[11:34.400 --> 11:38.480]  pretty close together. Your plants are only three inches tall, three inches wide. Why do they need
[11:38.480 --> 11:42.640]  a lot of space? Cram a lot of those together, put them under the light. Then as soon as they start
[11:42.640 --> 11:47.760]  growing, spread them out, make them comfortable, but don't give them two or three lights until you
[11:47.760 --> 11:53.280]  need to run two or three lights. This isn't as big of a deal in a small grow, but once you get into
[11:53.280 --> 11:58.320]  a commercial environment, when I'm saying one or three lights, that means 10, 15, 20 lights. That
[11:58.320 --> 12:04.400]  adds up quite quickly. So do you have unnecessary lighting that is running? Are your plants in small
[12:04.400 --> 12:10.240]  enough pots where you can push them together and save some space until it is time to add the bigger
[12:10.240 --> 12:14.400]  pots and the extra lighting? Now, something that will save you some more money if you're running
[12:14.400 --> 12:19.040]  smaller pots is you obviously don't need as much soil or cocoa as soon. You're going to need it
[12:19.040 --> 12:24.800]  later, but you don't need it now. You can save some money now. Money comes and goes. You may not
[12:24.800 --> 12:28.800]  have all the money right now. You may have it later to buy more soil for bigger pots. So you
[12:28.800 --> 12:33.200]  can use smaller pots for now until you get that next paycheck. Maybe do whatever you need to do
[12:33.200 --> 12:37.840]  to make the next few bucks. Then you put them in bigger pots. Then you have to spread them apart
[12:37.840 --> 12:41.680]  further, put them under more light, but then you need to water them more. So if you put them in a
[12:41.680 --> 12:46.800]  smaller pot, they don't need as much water. They don't need as much nutrients. Also, that takes
[12:46.800 --> 12:51.440]  less time. And we're going to talk about that here toward the end of the show. So one quick
[12:51.440 --> 12:56.240]  thing you can think about is pot size. Am I using too big of a pot too early? Can I keep these
[12:56.240 --> 13:01.360]  plants in smaller pots, keep them closer together and keep less light on? And that may save you some
[13:01.360 --> 13:05.520]  money. That could save you a lot of money. Just the water, the nutrients, the time, the light,
[13:05.520 --> 13:09.520]  then that equals more air conditioning and fans that you can turn off. That is one quick thing
[13:09.520 --> 13:14.720]  that can save you a few bucks. Consolidate the plants under less lights. No matter what kind of
[13:14.720 --> 13:18.800]  lights you're running, they do cost money. Even if they are high efficient LED lights,
[13:18.800 --> 13:22.560]  they are costing you money. They're generating heat. They're making more equipment run.
[13:22.560 --> 13:26.240]  And the bigger pots, if you're using bigger pots unnecessarily, it takes more water,
[13:26.240 --> 13:31.600]  takes more nutrients, takes more pH up or pH down, takes you longer to mix, takes you longer to water.
[13:31.600 --> 13:36.560]  The water costs money. It all adds up if you really pay attention and think about it. Now,
[13:36.560 --> 13:41.840]  let's talk about some of your ancillary gear. How are your dehumidifier and humidifiers running? Are
[13:41.840 --> 13:47.520]  they on too frequently? Are they on often enough? Are they on unnecessarily? Sometimes I recommend
[13:47.520 --> 13:52.880]  putting them on to battle each other. In a dry and cure environment, I will set them both at 55
[13:52.880 --> 13:58.000]  and just let them fight so that it stays at 55 all day in that room. But that is in a commercial
[13:58.000 --> 14:02.480]  environment where it is critical that we keep those conditions. Do you have gear running
[14:02.480 --> 14:07.440]  unnecessarily? Can you turn some of it off now that we've turned off some of the lights? Will
[14:07.440 --> 14:12.240]  that help you out? Have you cleaned the filters in those devices? Because when those filters get
[14:12.240 --> 14:16.960]  dirty, they are not as efficient. That is also true with your air conditioner. Have you cleaned
[14:16.960 --> 14:21.360]  your air conditioning filters? If they're dirty, they're sucking up some of your efficiency. You're
[14:21.360 --> 14:25.920]  not getting as much airflow. The motors are running. They're struggling. You're wasting money.
[14:25.920 --> 14:29.360]  You're not getting the air and the cooling that you think you're getting, but you are putting out
[14:29.360 --> 14:35.280]  the electricity and the stress on your gear, which is costing you money. So now that we're talking
[14:35.280 --> 14:40.560]  about air conditioning, let's talk about ducting. Are you running ducting? Do you have vented lights?
[14:40.560 --> 14:44.800]  Do you have a carbon filter that's blowing air out? Do you have some sort of air coming in?
[14:45.440 --> 14:52.400]  Ducting. Every time you put a bend in your ducting, it becomes less efficient. Every time you put a
[14:52.400 --> 14:58.400]  curve, a kink, a bend, or a twist in that ducting, you are slowing down the amount of air and the
[14:58.400 --> 15:02.640]  speed of the air, the volume of air, which can move through that duct. You are lessening the
[15:04.160 --> 15:10.480]  efficacy efficiency of the fan, the blower that you're using to blow that air through that ducting.
[15:10.960 --> 15:15.520]  If you straighten it out a little bit, you could probably save a few kilowatts,
[15:15.520 --> 15:20.080]  use a little less bucks, use a little less power to move more air. Of course, I understand ducts
[15:20.080 --> 15:25.200]  need to be bent. That's why we get the flexi duct. Shit does happen, but maybe unnecessary
[15:25.200 --> 15:30.800]  curves and shit, maybe unnecessary duct length can be minimized. One thing you do have to keep
[15:30.800 --> 15:35.280]  in mind though is if you're using the lights with the ducted hoods, you do need to keep the
[15:35.280 --> 15:39.520]  light from coming in if you've got sunshine or another light or something. So you may need those
[15:39.520 --> 15:45.600]  bends, I understand, but try to minimize and mitigate those excessive bends. If you are using
[15:45.600 --> 15:51.600]  the lights that have the glass between, so there's a bulb and glass and your canopy, that way the
[15:51.600 --> 15:56.960]  heat doesn't get down into your grow. You duck that heat out, clean that glass. That glass being
[15:56.960 --> 16:01.680]  dirty will suck up your lumens. If the light can't get through, it's not getting to your plants,
[16:01.680 --> 16:05.520]  you are wasting money. You're paying for it. The lights are burning, the lights are hot,
[16:05.520 --> 16:09.920]  and you're just cock blocking it with your pesticide that got sprayed up on that glass there,
[16:09.920 --> 16:14.000]  not even making it to your plants. Something else we can think about when it comes to ducting that
[16:14.000 --> 16:19.120]  I almost overlooked is where are you running your ducting? Are you wasting that heat? If you're
[16:19.120 --> 16:23.200]  running that hot air right outside of the house and it's the winter, maybe consider dumping that
[16:23.200 --> 16:28.240]  heat into the office, into a bedroom, somewhere that you want to heat up anyway. Maybe then you
[16:28.240 --> 16:32.320]  can turn off the heater and the rest of the house. You can just dump your grow room heat right into
[16:32.320 --> 16:36.320]  your bedroom and then you don't even have to run the heater. That will save you a few bucks. Use
[16:36.320 --> 16:40.880]  the heat that's already being created. Sometimes I will dump the heat from my bedroom into my
[16:40.880 --> 16:45.280]  flower space when the lights go off because in the winter, the flower room will get colder,
[16:45.280 --> 16:49.840]  but the bedroom stays on. So we just run the heat from there into the flower space. It keeps the
[16:49.840 --> 16:54.880]  flower space nice and warm. So think about where you're running your heat. Are you wasting it?
[16:54.880 --> 16:58.880]  Are you pulling cold air from somewhere and not sending it somewhere that it needs to be?
[16:58.880 --> 17:03.120]  Really think about where you're moving your air. You're moving temperature air, move it to where
[17:03.120 --> 17:08.080]  you want it. Maybe you can use it, recycle that air, warm up a room, cool down a room. I don't
[17:08.080 --> 17:12.400]  know your environment, your situation, but there are a lot of options that will come up where you
[17:12.400 --> 17:18.160]  can utilize the air, the heat, the cool that comes from the grow space. Now let's segue back into
[17:18.160 --> 17:25.440]  talking about space. Are you wasting space with unnecessary plants? Fortunately and unfortunately,
[17:25.440 --> 17:30.480]  I am limited by the state of Colorado of how many plants I could have. That kind of helps me out
[17:30.480 --> 17:35.760]  because I could have hoarder tendencies if I were unlimited on plants. I would have a lot of mother
[17:35.760 --> 17:40.320]  plants. Being a breeder, somebody who likes to create new genetics and have a large library of
[17:40.320 --> 17:45.680]  genetics to create and also a large library to smoke from, I would have a lot of plants if I
[17:45.680 --> 17:51.440]  weren't limited. So it's kind of a good thing that the state does limit me. Every plant in my garden
[17:51.440 --> 17:56.320]  has a purpose. I've got mother plants, I've got father plants, and then of course I've got my
[17:56.320 --> 18:00.720]  plants that are in bloom, that are seeded, and I've got my father plant in there dumping the pollen.
[18:00.720 --> 18:05.840]  So I've got very select plants that all have a purpose. Do you have plants that you're not
[18:05.840 --> 18:10.320]  exactly sure your plan, their goal, why are they sticking around? I kind of just like that one
[18:10.320 --> 18:15.680]  because that strain is cool. Is that strain worth a shit? Does it produce? Is it a quality strain?
[18:15.680 --> 18:19.280]  Are you just keeping that plant around for nostalgia because of the name, because of a
[18:19.280 --> 18:24.560]  cool story? It's got to meet goals. It's got to meet a criteria. It's got to meet a quota. Does
[18:24.560 --> 18:28.880]  it give you enough product when you grow it? Does it take too long to flower? Is it super potent?
[18:28.880 --> 18:33.840]  Does it taste right? If you're a commercial grower, does it sell? Because if you're putting all of
[18:33.840 --> 18:39.600]  this money into the grow, it's got to come back, right? So does it sell? When it sells, does it get
[18:39.600 --> 18:45.120]  you top dollar or do your clientele pass on it? If they pass on it, why are you growing that shit?
[18:45.120 --> 18:49.120]  Grow more of the lemon Jeffrey because the people are going to buy that. Grow the machine,
[18:49.120 --> 18:53.920]  grow the Saka souffle. That's what they're going to buy. If they're not buying it, switch it up.
[18:53.920 --> 19:00.800]  So every plant in your grow space should have a solid purpose and a strategy and a schedule.
[19:00.800 --> 19:05.680]  Not just a, it should not just be a potent plant that pays the bills, but it should also have a
[19:05.680 --> 19:09.840]  schedule. It got cut this day. It goes into veg this day. It goes into flower this day.
[19:09.840 --> 19:14.320]  I plan to cut it down this day. And then I intend to have it dried cured and sold or smoked or
[19:14.320 --> 19:19.840]  processed or whatever by this timeframe, have a schedule for every single plant in the grow,
[19:19.840 --> 19:26.080]  or that plant is kind of wasting space and messing up your schedule and messing up your income and
[19:26.080 --> 19:30.640]  your cost effectiveness. Now, since we're talking about individual plants in the grow,
[19:30.640 --> 19:36.160]  I did mention mother plants, our mother plants necessary for your style of grow.
[19:36.160 --> 19:41.440]  Think about this. A mother plant is kept to preserve the genetics so that when I want,
[19:42.080 --> 19:46.400]  let's just pick a plant. When I want golden goat, I can go to my golden goat plant,
[19:46.400 --> 19:50.800]  pull off six clones. Now I've got six clones of golden goat whenever I want them. And that mommy
[19:50.800 --> 19:56.080]  plant is always chilling there. She grows every six or eight months or so. I got to cut her down,
[19:56.080 --> 19:59.600]  take one of those best clones and remodel that clone and make a new one. Cause the plant just
[19:59.600 --> 20:04.560]  gets old and big and spindly and out of control. Just try to give it a fresh cut, start over. But
[20:04.560 --> 20:10.080]  for the most part, that golden goat mommy is there as a bank as preservation. What is stopping me
[20:10.080 --> 20:15.200]  from just using that golden goat veg plant? And right before I put it into flower, take a few
[20:15.200 --> 20:21.200]  clones and use those clones as my next veg run, move that plant right into the flower space.
[20:21.200 --> 20:25.600]  If you are not a breeder, if you are not completely dependent on keeping those strains around,
[20:25.600 --> 20:31.120]  that is a very viable option that will free up numbers for you. So you can just take a plant
[20:31.120 --> 20:36.800]  that is your lemon Jeffrey plant, take six clones of it, put the big plant into the flower room.
[20:36.800 --> 20:40.800]  And you got six clones growing up for your next run. They're already right there. Maybe wait until
[20:40.800 --> 20:45.600]  your clones root before you put that plant into flower. So you have some security, but it is not
[20:45.600 --> 20:51.120]  completely necessary to keep a mother plant around. If you are skilled at taking clones,
[20:51.120 --> 20:55.600]  if you understand how to keep veg plants healthy and happy, and if you can get the clones to root
[20:55.600 --> 21:00.640]  in a timely manner before you put the other plant into flower. So keeping clones is not always
[21:00.640 --> 21:05.760]  necessary. And that could save you a lot of space. I don't recommend that for a commercial environment
[21:05.760 --> 21:10.240]  because you may need a lot of clones. Uh, you need some dedicated plants to give you cuts from,
[21:10.240 --> 21:15.360]  but in a home grow space, that would save you a lot of plants. Now let's get back to talking about
[21:15.360 --> 21:20.240]  mom plants a little bit. Why do you have so many mom plants? Do you need them? Or why do you have
[21:20.240 --> 21:25.200]  so many strains? Do you need them? Are they necessary? Um, do you need that many? Are you
[21:25.200 --> 21:29.760]  just keeping them for hoarder purposes? I think I said most of this already, but really think about
[21:29.760 --> 21:34.400]  why you're keeping each plant and then possibly minimize if you don't need all of those. If you've
[21:34.400 --> 21:39.360]  got two that are, uh, it depends on what your goal is. It's all about the goal, but if you're
[21:39.360 --> 21:43.680]  a commercial cropper, find the one or two that sell the best. That way you don't have to keep
[21:43.680 --> 21:48.640]  clones or moms. You could just keep production going. Uh, if you're a medical grower, find the
[21:48.640 --> 21:52.320]  one or two, the one for the day, the one for the night, and then one to switch it up because you
[21:52.320 --> 21:55.680]  always need that switch hitter. I feel like you get strain lock if you smoke the shit,
[21:55.680 --> 22:00.080]  uh, the same shit too long, but try to pick two or three, maybe four and minimize down and make
[22:00.080 --> 22:04.960]  sure that every strain in that garden has a solid reason for being there. If you feel to grow with a
[22:04.960 --> 22:08.880]  bunch of sixes, how are you going to get a bunch of nines in there? And if you got a bunch of nines
[22:08.880 --> 22:13.360]  and you got them surrounded by six, is it just D values the nine? Let's get the nines in there.
[22:13.360 --> 22:18.400]  Maybe some tens, maybe some 11s. If you quit fucking with the sixes. All right. Another great
[22:18.400 --> 22:24.240]  way to save a few bucks or increase productivity in a small space is to add some shelves for vertical
[22:24.240 --> 22:28.720]  growing. If you've got clones on a shelf, what's to stop you from putting like a three or four
[22:28.800 --> 22:32.800]  tier shelf with a T five light, with a tray of clones, with a T five light, with the tray of
[22:32.800 --> 22:37.200]  clones, with the T five light and a tray of clones, or just a one shelf area. And you could
[22:37.200 --> 22:41.760]  put small plants on the bottom, big plants on the top, uh, hang your light from the underside.
[22:41.760 --> 22:45.520]  So you got a light for the small plants, then put your big light up on the ceiling and put your
[22:45.520 --> 22:50.240]  plants up on the top shelf. Use that vertical space to the best of your ability. We have a
[22:50.240 --> 22:54.800]  friend that's been on the podcast before that does a complete vertical grow. So there are a lot of
[22:54.800 --> 23:00.160]  options to go up. If you run out of space on the floor, use that vertical space. Uh, then you can
[23:00.160 --> 23:03.920]  make space for all of your gear and all of your stuff, get that up off the floor. Then you've got
[23:03.920 --> 23:09.360]  more floor space for working more floor space for plants. Also, I see a lot of walkways and grows
[23:09.360 --> 23:13.200]  in a small grow in a personal grow. What do you need a walkway for? We talked about this
[23:13.200 --> 23:18.400]  on a previous episode. That is not a walking path. That's not your Zen garden. That is not where you
[23:18.400 --> 23:22.160]  go to put your hands behind your back and walk around like old men and feed the ducks. Think
[23:22.160 --> 23:27.440]  about life. That is a productivity space. Put plants in the fucking walkway. I understand a
[23:27.440 --> 23:31.760]  commercial girl. You've got to get through there. If it's your personal grow, move plants into that
[23:31.760 --> 23:35.920]  space so you can fit another row of plants, put them in there. You're ripping yourself off. We're
[23:35.920 --> 23:40.320]  not growing concrete. We're not growing drywall. We're not growing floor. We want to grow more
[23:40.320 --> 23:45.120]  plants, put more plants in that space. That is my theory back to filling up the cabinet or the box
[23:45.120 --> 23:50.000]  or the cooler, fill it up, quit wasting space with the walkway. You could just do some work, move the
[23:50.000 --> 23:54.240]  plants and walk through, do the Jenga move, do the Tetris move, do whatever you have to do to get
[23:54.240 --> 23:59.920]  through there. But let's not waste so much space with walkways. Where am I? I feel like I got a lot
[23:59.920 --> 24:05.040]  going on. Shelves for vertical space. How many moms do you have? Cut and go. Do you have a strategy?
[24:05.040 --> 24:10.160]  Do you have a strategy for every plant? When I cut a clone, I know, I think I mentioned this
[24:10.160 --> 24:15.200]  briefly, I know when I cut a clone, I know where it's going to go into. I know which space it will
[24:15.200 --> 24:20.160]  go in the veg area. I know which space it's going to go into the flower area. I know basically what
[24:20.160 --> 24:25.200]  day it'll go into the flower area. Do you have a plan and a strategy for every single plant?
[24:25.200 --> 24:29.600]  I see some people that just cut a bunch of clones. They pot all of them. And then when it comes time
[24:29.600 --> 24:35.200]  to go into flower, they've got 20 or 30 clones and they pick the best 10 or 12. What are you doing?
[24:35.200 --> 24:40.160]  Yeah. Yeah. That many plants extra running for that long that you wasted water, soil, space,
[24:40.160 --> 24:45.200]  newts, time and energy. Get rid of that shit. Every plant you cut should be top shelf. Give it
[24:45.200 --> 24:48.880]  the best love you can pay the best attention you can to it. And that way you don't have to cut a
[24:48.880 --> 24:54.720]  bunch of extras and waste all the time and space. Have a goal for every single plant that you cut.
[24:54.720 --> 24:59.360]  Everything costs something. Everything in the grow costs something. Let's start with just cutting
[24:59.360 --> 25:05.360]  clones. You had to use a clone gel. You had to use clone plugs, a clone dome. You had to clean
[25:05.360 --> 25:11.600]  the equipment, which took you time and energy. Then you had to use water and nutrients. That's
[25:11.600 --> 25:15.280]  just for cutting clones. We're already at a substantial cost. You had to go to the store
[25:15.280 --> 25:19.600]  and drop some money already. Then you've got to pop those clones into something. You've got to
[25:19.600 --> 25:24.160]  buy either soil, cocoa, something to put them in. Then you got to have a container to put that shit
[25:24.160 --> 25:28.080]  in. Then probably some plant tags or something. Then we got to feed them. We got to give them
[25:28.080 --> 25:33.520]  water. That is material we've got to pay for and more time that we are investing. Everything costs
[25:33.520 --> 25:39.040]  something. Big pots cost something. Soil and cocoa again cost something. The pH up and down cost
[25:39.040 --> 25:44.960]  something. The pH pen costs a lot. Those things are expensive and they die. You break them quite often.
[25:44.960 --> 25:49.840]  Everything costs a lot. If you've got a pH pen, make sure you keep the cap on it. Make sure you
[25:49.840 --> 25:53.040]  keep it clean and calibrated. That'll save you some money because then you don't have to buy a
[25:53.040 --> 25:58.160]  new one. Take good care of your equipment. The lights all cost money. The water costs a lot of
[25:58.160 --> 26:02.400]  money. But something you might not be thinking about, something you may not have considered,
[26:02.400 --> 26:07.440]  what is your time worth? What is your energy in that grow worth? If you're a single person like
[26:07.440 --> 26:10.960]  myself, I'm just a single dude. I do have a daughter. She's 18. She wants to hang out
[26:10.960 --> 26:16.080]  sometimes nowadays. But I'm a single dude so I can dedicate a lot of time to my garden. But
[26:16.080 --> 26:19.920]  if you've got a family, if you've got a lot of shit going on, people want your attention. Your
[26:19.920 --> 26:23.680]  girlfriend's trying to go to the movie. Your kids need attention. Your dog wants to play.
[26:23.680 --> 26:27.920]  The other part of life, your friends on the Xbox Live or PlayStation Live want to hang out and blow
[26:27.920 --> 26:32.880]  up zombies and shit. You got other shit to do. So your time is very valuable. What is it worth to
[26:32.880 --> 26:38.000]  you? How much time are you spending in there? When it comes to recouping the cost of your grow,
[26:38.000 --> 26:42.960]  however you're doing that, are you considering your time? Are you getting paid for the hours
[26:42.960 --> 26:47.040]  that you're spending in there? And then think about maybe you'll do shit more quickly if you're
[26:47.040 --> 26:51.520]  thinking like, oh, I'm in here this much a day because time is money. No matter what you're
[26:51.520 --> 26:55.920]  doing, no matter where you are, unfortunately now time is money. You could be at work. You
[26:55.920 --> 27:00.880]  could be doing something else, making some money, doing another task, fulfilling a side job. So
[27:00.880 --> 27:06.320]  let's get the stuff done and think about how many hours we're spending in that grow. All right. Now
[27:06.320 --> 27:10.320]  let's talk about a couple of other things that I think can definitely help us out if we use
[27:10.320 --> 27:16.560]  strategy when purchasing. What is your pesticide regimen? What is your integrated pest management
[27:16.560 --> 27:22.080]  plan, strategy, goal, schedule? Are you going to buy pesticides? Are you going to buy predator bugs?
[27:22.080 --> 27:27.280]  Let's think about this before we get too far into any grow, because this is going to be a cost.
[27:27.280 --> 27:32.800]  Quality pesticides are not cheap, but if you don't use something, bugs will get to your garden and
[27:32.800 --> 27:38.800]  that is even more expensive. Preventative measures are more affordable and more effective than
[27:38.800 --> 27:41.680]  trying to fix a problem because then you're going to have to go nuclear. You're going to have to
[27:41.680 --> 27:46.960]  find specific shit based on what stage you're in. I think if you plan ahead, start having a pesticide
[27:46.960 --> 27:51.440]  regimen early, it is more cost effective. Are you going to use spray pesticides? Are you going to
[27:51.440 --> 27:56.160]  use bugs? What is your strategy? Let's think about it now, because if we plan for this ahead,
[27:56.160 --> 28:01.280]  fit it in the budget when we build the grow, that'll help us out. Then let's not use too much
[28:01.280 --> 28:05.760]  pesticide. I see a lot of people and they mix it up. They go mix up a five or I work in a commercial
[28:05.760 --> 28:09.760]  grow, so it's a five gallon thing of fucking or a one gallon thing of pesticides most of the time.
[28:09.760 --> 28:14.080]  And then I see them dump some of that. Let's remember and learn how much we're going to use
[28:14.080 --> 28:19.520]  per spray. Let's try to anticipate it. You don't always have to mix up the whole entire fucking
[28:19.520 --> 28:24.560]  sprayer worth. You can just mix up enough to cover the plants. So this time, maybe just do a
[28:24.560 --> 28:28.880]  water spray, put fucking half a gallon of water in your sprayer and see if that covers the room.
[28:28.880 --> 28:32.960]  And if it does, you only need a half a gallon of pesticide. And if it doesn't, maybe you need a full
[28:32.960 --> 28:36.640]  gallon, give it a dry or just a wet run. I was going to say a dry run, but, you know, give it a
[28:36.640 --> 28:40.640]  wet run and see how much you need to wet the room. Then go back the next time and hit it with the
[28:40.640 --> 28:45.760]  pesticide. Let's not waste the pesticide. Then think about how much time you're spending applying
[28:45.760 --> 28:50.720]  those pesticides. I always talk about it, the cost versus releasing the predators versus applying
[28:50.720 --> 28:55.200]  the pesticide, which is more cost-effective because you do need the personal protective equipment.
[28:55.200 --> 28:59.840]  You got to suit up. There's a re-entry interval with the pesticides. Sometimes the predators are
[28:59.840 --> 29:04.000]  more cost-effective, but you do need to have a crew to go put them out on the plants. So think
[29:04.000 --> 29:08.240]  of which one is going to be more cost-effective for you. Then when it comes to applying the
[29:08.240 --> 29:13.600]  pesticides, when it comes to just about anything in the grow, get the appropriate equipment.
[29:13.600 --> 29:17.680]  If you get some cheap sprayers, some cheap shit, it's going to break after the second or third,
[29:17.680 --> 29:23.360]  maybe sometimes the first use. They always say the most expensive hammer is the cheap hammer
[29:23.360 --> 29:27.120]  because you're going to break it and you got to buy a hammer every fucking week, every month,
[29:27.120 --> 29:32.720]  get a good hammer. You only got to buy it once. Then they say, uh, pay once, cry once, some shit
[29:32.720 --> 29:37.200]  like that. I don't remember all the funny shit that old people say, but, uh, buy quality shit.
[29:37.920 --> 29:43.200]  You're going to have a better experience with good equipment. If your grow room equipment is
[29:43.280 --> 29:49.040]  frustrating to use, you can't have a reliable, an enjoyable, uh, relaxing time in that grow. Part of
[29:49.040 --> 29:52.960]  the point of going in there is enjoying yourself and having a good time and relaxing. I always say
[29:52.960 --> 29:57.200]  it's a work area, but it should feel good to be in there. And if it's frustrating, if your gear
[29:57.200 --> 30:02.000]  doesn't work, if you're measuring equipment, your pH equipment doesn't work, it's going to frustrate
[30:02.000 --> 30:06.800]  you, get good shit so you can enjoy yourself. And then cheap shit breaks. It is going to break.
[30:06.800 --> 30:12.000]  You're going to have to buy it again, replacing a dehumidifier or repairing a broken air conditioner
[30:12.000 --> 30:16.560]  in the middle of a grow is a struggle. The grow is running. The plants are relying on that. We
[30:16.560 --> 30:20.640]  can't turn off the lights and you've already purchased the air conditioner. One time spent
[30:20.640 --> 30:24.640]  the time to install it. Why didn't you get a good one that we didn't have to replace that
[30:24.640 --> 30:28.800]  bitch in the middle of the grow and move the plants around and struggle and get in there with
[30:28.800 --> 30:34.240]  the ladder while the lights are running. It was so much easier if we spent the money early on and
[30:34.240 --> 30:39.200]  didn't fuck around. I think one of my last pieces of advice on saving you money in the grow room
[30:39.200 --> 30:44.960]  is to invest in industrial equipment, not cheap Walmart shit, not cheap target shit,
[30:44.960 --> 30:49.280]  skip the stores, the box stores, and get industrial equipment. We were building
[30:49.280 --> 30:54.240]  a gross space and agricultural workspace, whether it's your home grow, especially your commercial
[30:54.240 --> 31:00.160]  grow. Don't go get the cheap shit, get industrial stuff designed for greenhouses, for commercial
[31:00.160 --> 31:05.360]  horticultural production, or it will break. If you try to stick just a basic piece of gear that
[31:05.360 --> 31:09.680]  was made for your bedroom or for your office, a dehumidifier for the office. If you try to put
[31:09.680 --> 31:13.680]  that in the grow, it's not going to keep up. It's going to get funky and gunky on the inside.
[31:13.680 --> 31:17.600]  It's going to get dirty. It's not going to keep up and it's going to die. Buy something quality,
[31:17.600 --> 31:22.800]  get the good shit. We're building a workspace. We're not building an office. We're not building
[31:22.800 --> 31:27.680]  just a little, it might sound like cutesy little grow. I think of it more as it's a functioning
[31:27.680 --> 31:33.280]  industrial space. So get industrial shit that's going to work and going to last. The good shit
[31:33.280 --> 31:37.280]  works so much better. And then people, you're not going to have as many problems. People always
[31:37.280 --> 31:41.360]  complain when they buy the cheap shit. They're like, well, I spent the money and my problem still
[31:41.360 --> 31:45.120]  exists. It's because you didn't spend enough. And I know I'm trying to tell you how to save money,
[31:45.120 --> 31:50.720]  but you'll save money by spending money upfront. That may sound crazy, but you'll see how it works.
[31:50.720 --> 31:54.720]  If you're the one of those people that keeps buying the cheap shit, buy the good one. How many
[31:54.720 --> 31:57.760]  times are you going to deal with fix and shit? Just buy the expensive one the first time.
[31:58.480 --> 32:01.360]  If you can afford it, buy the best you can buy the first time.
[32:02.160 --> 32:05.760]  When it comes to buying air conditioners for a commercial grow, I always say,
[32:06.400 --> 32:10.880]  don't get one giant unit, get several smaller units. That way when that big one,
[32:10.880 --> 32:15.120]  when one of them breaks, you've got a couple of backups. You can limp along and keep it growing.
[32:15.120 --> 32:18.880]  I've been in commercial grows where the giant air conditioner broke, and then it's been 110 in the
[32:18.880 --> 32:23.200]  whole grow. Got to turn off half the lights and try to make that happen. If we had just three
[32:23.200 --> 32:29.120]  small ACs, something would have kept us a little bit cool. All right. I am rambling now. I want to
[32:29.120 --> 32:32.880]  thank my buddy Double Door. Big shout out to Matt. Matt kind of inspired this episode. He's like,
