[00:18.360 --> 00:20.680]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[00:20.680 --> 00:23.880]  It's time for episode number 142 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:24.080 --> 00:27.200]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.840 --> 00:29.920]  That's right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.960 --> 00:31.800]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:32.160 --> 00:34.840]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the
[00:34.840 --> 00:38.280]  current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:39.880 --> 00:41.680]  I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:41.720 --> 00:44.040]  I want to thank you once again for joining me as always.
[00:44.080 --> 00:46.800]  I need to give a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots
[00:46.800 --> 00:49.040]  band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:49.360 --> 00:52.800]  Big thanks to Kat Ku and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:55.080 --> 00:58.720]  I got through it without coughing you guys. Oh, I deserve a world. Oh man.
[00:58.720 --> 01:00.880]  I was trying to go fast. Welcome to the show. Everybody.
[01:01.160 --> 01:04.840]  This episode is the 710 episode. This is going to come out on Sunday, 7, 10,
[01:04.840 --> 01:07.440]  happy 7, 10, everybody. I hope you got the email turned on.
[01:07.440 --> 01:09.200]  I hope you got the dabber going. I got you.
[01:09.640 --> 01:11.160]  I hope you got a quartz banger heated up.
[01:11.200 --> 01:15.320]  Hope you got that a highly educated titanium quartz combo going on.
[01:15.680 --> 01:18.880]  Hope you got a, an elevate rig with a fat nail on it.
[01:18.880 --> 01:20.560]  I hope you're smoking some super good shatter.
[01:20.760 --> 01:22.200]  I hope you're a spoiled bitch like I am.
[01:22.200 --> 01:25.960]  I hope you're over there smoking some of those fresh OG Kush turps from our
[01:25.960 --> 01:28.880]  friends at Evo labs. Ladies and gentlemen on the show with me today,
[01:28.880 --> 01:31.040]  celebrating 7, 10 is white. Mike, how you doing, bro?
[01:31.080 --> 01:34.920]  Doing good, man. How are you? Dude? I am DTFO. I'm dabbed the fuck out.
[01:34.920 --> 01:38.840]  We had a little pre pregame over here as well. Ooh, I guess.
[01:38.840 --> 01:43.200]  I still got the cough going. I got the throat thing where you got to act like
[01:43.200 --> 01:45.400]  you're not going to cough. You got to keep convincing yourself.
[01:45.440 --> 01:47.680]  I'm not going to come. No, I'm going to cough. I'm going to do it.
[01:47.680 --> 01:51.000]  It's going to happen. Anyway, welcome to show everybody at 7, 10.
[01:51.000 --> 01:53.280]  I hope you're taking dabs with us. Uh, tweet me,
[01:53.280 --> 01:56.200]  tell me what you're dabbing at GFYH podcast on Twitter.
[01:56.200 --> 01:58.760]  I want to know what you're taking dabs of right now. We want to know,
[01:58.800 --> 02:02.400]  is it live resin? Is it shatter? Is it poop soup? Is it tain batter?
[02:02.480 --> 02:04.960]  What do you got going on? Is it some of those Evo labs, fresh trips?
[02:04.960 --> 02:07.800]  Let's talk about some of these fresh trips. Let's not keep talking about it.
[02:07.800 --> 02:10.920]  Not a lot of people. Yeah, not a lot of people in the world know what the hell.
[02:10.920 --> 02:13.480]  I'm even talking about. It got fancier people.
[02:13.720 --> 02:18.360]  And we have stepped up our game here in Colorado, our friends at Evo labs. Uh,
[02:18.400 --> 02:22.160]  so we, they, I said, we like I'm involved in this shit. I smoke it.
[02:22.160 --> 02:24.280]  That's my, my, my role in this party.
[02:24.720 --> 02:29.640]  Consumer level only. I do a little product research for these guys, but, uh,
[02:29.640 --> 02:33.320]  so I'll be your space monkey. I don't care. We take, they take some shatter.
[02:33.320 --> 02:35.400]  They take cash. I think they're taking CO2 oil.
[02:35.400 --> 02:40.360]  I'm 90% sure that this is made with CO2 oil, a CO2 extraction. Uh,
[02:40.440 --> 02:44.800]  and there's a lot of people right now in the industry playing with, um,
[02:44.840 --> 02:47.840]  refining CO2 oil in one way or another.
[02:48.000 --> 02:51.640]  And this seems to be my favorite way. This is a fractal distillation.
[02:51.640 --> 02:56.440]  The first home run I've gotten to play with all of the clear, uh,
[02:56.460 --> 02:59.840]  the, uh, they're calling it a distillate.
[02:59.860 --> 03:04.000]  All of the distillate is done with a fractal distillation process and they're
[03:04.000 --> 03:07.080]  separating basically everything. Uh, the cannabinoids,
[03:07.080 --> 03:10.320]  the terpenoids and the lipids are all pulled apart.
[03:10.760 --> 03:15.440]  And this container right here is a container of nothing but the
[03:15.440 --> 03:17.360]  THC. This is 90%,
[03:17.400 --> 03:21.560]  90.94% THC and 1.1% CBD.
[03:22.440 --> 03:24.800]  This is raw distillate from evil Evo labs.
[03:25.440 --> 03:27.040]  I'm gonna open the jar here and try to contain, uh,
[03:27.080 --> 03:29.280]  describe what's in this container the best I can.
[03:29.880 --> 03:34.600]  It looks like really runny honey or, uh,
[03:35.440 --> 03:38.240]  super clear olive oil maybe. Yeah.
[03:38.360 --> 03:41.320]  But it's got more of the consistency of like honey or maybe a little bit.
[03:41.440 --> 03:45.040]  Than any olive oil I've ever seen. But yeah, the color might be right though.
[03:45.160 --> 03:47.480]  Yeah. Uh, yeah. It just looks like, I don't know.
[03:47.480 --> 03:50.760]  It's like honey almost in there, but this doesn't have much flavor. It's,
[03:50.840 --> 03:55.000]  it is just raw distillate, super stupid potent.
[03:55.000 --> 03:58.560]  I put a little bit of this on the dabber and this is where it gets fun. Uh,
[03:58.560 --> 04:02.840]  I take that little bit that's on the dabber and I dunk that into the ghost
[04:03.120 --> 04:05.920]  train. Hayes raw turps. Uh,
[04:05.960 --> 04:10.240]  this is mostly turpenoids with a little bit of cannabinoids,
[04:10.240 --> 04:11.360]  like one or 2% THC.
[04:12.080 --> 04:14.240]  If I call it the adult version of fun dips.
[04:14.440 --> 04:16.880]  This is definitely, well, we've, we've on, well,
[04:16.880 --> 04:19.400]  I'm a deadhead and we've got our own little version of fun dips,
[04:19.640 --> 04:23.960]  but this is the weed world of a fun dip, right? This is a,
[04:24.320 --> 04:29.600]  it's a beautiful thing. This is a, so you take that beautiful 90% THC
[04:29.640 --> 04:32.960]  distillate and then you dunk it, you dunk it.
[04:32.960 --> 04:37.760]  And the glorious part is in my other hand, I've got some OG Kush turps.
[04:37.840 --> 04:41.480]  So I can either dunk it in my OG Kush turps or I can dunk it over here in my
[04:41.480 --> 04:44.560]  ghost train, Hayes turps, or I could dunk it in one.
[04:44.560 --> 04:47.840]  And then I could dunk it in the other. And we're changing up the flavors.
[04:47.840 --> 04:52.440]  It, the OG Kush turps. If you put it on this distillate and dab it,
[04:52.720 --> 04:53.720]  it tastes like you,
[04:53.720 --> 04:58.280]  if apples tasted like OG Kush and you bit into an OG Kush apple and it was just
[04:59.000 --> 05:01.920]  OG Kush all in my mouth and you could almost chew the flavor.
[05:02.200 --> 05:04.960]  That's how much OG Kush flavor these turps put in your face.
[05:05.200 --> 05:08.400]  It's the flavor contents really, really nice this way.
[05:08.520 --> 05:11.960]  And then the high from the distillate comboed with,
[05:11.960 --> 05:15.480]  I really liked the high that I get from the ghost train Hayes. It's a,
[05:15.520 --> 05:18.560]  this is sativa dominant strain. So I talk about this every day.
[05:18.560 --> 05:22.600]  The other stuff that's in it, it's the THC is definitely a big part of the high,
[05:23.000 --> 05:28.000]  but everything else that's in it really plays with that THC and some fun
[05:28.520 --> 05:33.040]  ways. I almost never go for the most potent on the shelf.
[05:33.520 --> 05:35.320]  And if you think about the rest of your life, you,
[05:35.440 --> 05:37.040]  you typically don't do that either.
[05:37.880 --> 05:41.000]  You've got to get that other component to it in this way. You can get both.
[05:41.000 --> 05:45.080]  You can get insanely potent and really, really flavorful.
[05:45.480 --> 05:49.040]  I've been kind of being a snobby bitch. I take some of this blue Sherb,
[05:49.480 --> 05:53.920]  a 120 micron, fresh frozen solventless hash. And I roll out a little Patty.
[05:54.400 --> 05:57.920]  And then I dunk some, some some Durban poison shatter onto it.
[05:57.920 --> 06:00.680]  And then I rubbed a little cactus cooler, live resin on top of that.
[06:01.160 --> 06:02.680]  And then I put a little bit of the turps on it.
[06:03.040 --> 06:06.040]  And then I put some of that 90% THC distillate on top of there.
[06:06.040 --> 06:08.600]  And I took a big ass dab of that. Uh,
[06:08.840 --> 06:12.520]  remember in high school when you used to go park somewhere and see how high you
[06:12.540 --> 06:13.360]  could get.
[06:13.640 --> 06:18.240]  I don't think we got that high when I was when I took that big ass dab,
[06:18.260 --> 06:22.400]  my arm hair was wiggling around. Like it was visibly waving like a flag.
[06:22.560 --> 06:27.160]  Something similar, which is much, much cheaper product with, uh,
[06:27.160 --> 06:28.920]  with just your typical wax or shatter.
[06:28.920 --> 06:32.440]  I'll take a piece of shatter and kind of pancake it out real far,
[06:32.440 --> 06:36.280]  throw a little wax in the middle, roll up a little taquito and dab that.
[06:36.280 --> 06:39.600]  But mine are much smaller and much less fancy than the ones you've been thrown
[06:39.600 --> 06:41.760]  down. I like to go big or go home. And I take dabs.
[06:42.480 --> 06:46.560]  I'll go little and go often. It's so much. I go big and go often.
[06:47.720 --> 06:48.600]  I'm best of both worlds.
[06:48.920 --> 06:52.800]  That's the one of the best parts about taking dabs is that you can grab the
[06:52.800 --> 06:56.160]  dabber and Mike can take his dosage. Mike's a cigarette smoker.
[06:56.440 --> 06:59.400]  So, uh, when you get Mike worked up a little bit, you can hear him gurgle.
[06:59.520 --> 07:02.520]  He doesn't even need dabs to start making funky lung butter noises.
[07:02.520 --> 07:06.120]  Nope. That sounds like the bomb occasionally. So you give them, I give Mike,
[07:07.080 --> 07:10.200]  uh, if you handed me the dabs that I gave Mike, I would laugh at you.
[07:10.200 --> 07:13.360]  I'd say, can you maybe triple quadruple that up? Right.
[07:13.360 --> 07:17.000]  And Mike takes just little pin sides, dads, probably the dads you take.
[07:17.240 --> 07:19.280]  Mike takes that size of a dab. That's,
[07:19.280 --> 07:23.480]  and he will cough and turn purple and get sweaty with the email carb cap
[07:23.480 --> 07:26.800]  setup as smooth as it is over here. I do like cough like a beast.
[07:27.600 --> 07:30.440]  It's not nearly as bad as home. Cause I don't have that carb cap.
[07:30.440 --> 07:34.400]  The cap, the cap adds quite a bit. People get yourself a carb cap.
[07:34.440 --> 07:37.520]  This is a seven 10 episode. Let's educate folks on the email right quick.
[07:38.000 --> 07:42.880]  The, the electronic continuously heated nail is a beautiful, beautiful thing.
[07:43.200 --> 07:46.440]  It's also a little dangerous depending on where you dab. Uh, I,
[07:46.960 --> 07:50.760]  I had one in the car for several days. Well, the space I,
[07:50.760 --> 07:54.960]  I dab often is also shared by three large dogs that are really furry and
[07:55.600 --> 08:00.600]  psychotic. And so like, if I was going to add an email to that mix,
[08:00.600 --> 08:03.120]  like something would get set on fire that I care about. Yeah.
[08:03.120 --> 08:05.120]  A dog would get burned. You have a bald spot somewhere.
[08:05.120 --> 08:08.360]  And so there's kind of a reason I don't have one yet, but it's,
[08:08.600 --> 08:11.080]  it's on the short list of things to treat myself to.
[08:11.120 --> 08:15.160]  I had to take mine out of the car. Uh, I was getting a careless,
[08:15.160 --> 08:19.160]  I was getting too high in the car, which I was like, I'm, I'm pretty,
[08:19.160 --> 08:21.640]  pretty, uh, medicated here. I got to chill out on this.
[08:22.080 --> 08:26.800]  And then also I had to set the rig in the cup holder and I forgot it was there.
[08:26.800 --> 08:28.400]  And I felt warmth a couple of times.
[08:28.400 --> 08:30.520]  I don't know that I was going to burn myself, but I was like, Ooh,
[08:30.520 --> 08:32.600]  that is warm over there. And I had to think about it. I was like, yeah,
[08:32.600 --> 08:35.360]  I'm kind of close to that. So I took the email out of the car.
[08:35.440 --> 08:38.160]  That doesn't happen anymore. Uh, be careful. You guys,
[08:38.480 --> 08:39.680]  I can't tell you what to do,
[08:39.680 --> 08:42.880]  but if there's somebody in the backseat that needs to have their medical
[08:43.000 --> 08:44.840]  cannabis available while you're driving,
[08:44.840 --> 08:47.640]  they can consume their medical cannabis and do your thing. You're an adult.
[08:48.120 --> 08:53.160]  But so the email, there's a box on my table. It's a six inches long,
[08:53.200 --> 08:54.040]  four inches tall.
[08:54.480 --> 08:57.480]  It's smaller than the original Nintendo, but a little taller.
[08:57.640 --> 09:00.880]  Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And it's got a display on it.
[09:00.880 --> 09:03.560]  Little led display with the number. It's got a power switch on it.
[09:04.000 --> 09:06.360]  One of the coolest fucking features. It's got a USB port.
[09:06.360 --> 09:09.920]  Mike is charging his phone pretty much every episode that I've been on in the
[09:09.920 --> 09:12.880]  last six months. My phone's been charging on that USB slot.
[09:12.880 --> 09:16.280]  That's a really beautiful feature. Shout out to my friend, Giddy up at EvoTech.
[09:16.440 --> 09:19.560]  This, this email was actually a gift from Giddy up at EmoTech.
[09:19.560 --> 09:22.680]  So big shout out and shout out to a Margulies for the replacement coils.
[09:22.680 --> 09:24.400]  I appreciate that, bro. Uh,
[09:24.440 --> 09:27.800]  but so there's this box with an led screen on the front with numbers displayed
[09:27.820 --> 09:31.120]  on it. Then coming out of that box is another cord. It's a silver cord.
[09:31.120 --> 09:35.520]  It's a silver braided cord and it goes to where the dab nail is.
[09:35.800 --> 09:39.200]  Yeah. So if, if you're using any sort of nail setup,
[09:39.680 --> 09:43.880]  instead of the little nail that sits inside the rig and the dome, um,
[09:43.920 --> 09:45.320]  or a titanium dome list,
[09:45.320 --> 09:50.320]  we've got a much larger titanium dome list that has this coil
[09:50.340 --> 09:51.240]  leading to it.
[09:51.240 --> 09:54.680]  And then it's tightly wrapped around the nail so that it can evenly heat that
[09:54.680 --> 09:57.840]  surface to whatever temperature we feel like.
[09:57.920 --> 10:00.080]  And that's where I want to jump in. And, uh,
[10:00.360 --> 10:03.320]  everybody talks about what temperature is your email set to.
[10:03.800 --> 10:08.360]  I do not believe that that number right there where it says seven 17 right now.
[10:08.560 --> 10:11.040]  That's not at all a temperature. I don't think that's a temperature.
[10:11.040 --> 10:14.720]  I don't think it correlates to the actual temperature on my nail surface
[10:14.720 --> 10:19.720]  because I think this box would cost much more money for it to actually have a
[10:20.240 --> 10:24.120]  thermostat inside of it's doing that. Uh, one of our friends that is a, uh,
[10:24.160 --> 10:27.680]  the guy that works on my website actually told me that's actually a frequency.
[10:27.840 --> 10:30.920]  But that's, that's what I've always understood it to be is just the random
[10:30.920 --> 10:34.320]  frequency that it kicks out. Plus it gives you something to work.
[10:34.320 --> 10:37.680]  It's like your speakers. 11 doesn't fucking mean anything. Perfect. Yeah.
[10:38.280 --> 10:39.720]  My car thing to you.
[10:41.400 --> 10:43.960]  It's like the prime spot. If I go up to 26, it gets a little,
[10:44.800 --> 10:46.200]  and you don't want to hear that. Um,
[10:46.280 --> 10:49.080]  Jerry starts sounding a little extra heroin if you turn them up too loud.
[10:49.920 --> 10:52.560]  I've posted pictures before us getting ready to record stuff.
[10:52.560 --> 10:54.840]  And somebody always chimes in and is like, dude,
[10:54.880 --> 10:58.240]  your emails like 300 degrees too hot. And it's like,
[10:58.240 --> 11:01.480]  that's not a temperature is always like the first three replies that I have to
[11:01.480 --> 11:04.560]  put up. I'm sure if you bought seven emo tech units,
[11:04.600 --> 11:07.520]  they'd all be close to the couple that have the temperature display.
[11:07.520 --> 11:10.320]  And I like that. Yeah. The one task rock made the original,
[11:10.320 --> 11:12.000]  and we're going to talk about task rock. You guys,
[11:12.000 --> 11:13.760]  this is the fucking seven 10 episode.
[11:13.760 --> 11:16.440]  You best believe we're going to talk about our boy task rock. Uh,
[11:16.480 --> 11:19.920]  the original email, that task rock of highly educated, the innovator,
[11:19.920 --> 11:24.720]  the originator, uh, that original email did, I think, uh,
[11:24.760 --> 11:28.080]  that temperature did correlate to the one on the box, although I'm not certain,
[11:28.080 --> 11:31.480]  but I'm pretty sure it did shout out to big D with the original.
[11:31.480 --> 11:35.320]  He's got the museum version. He's got the first email that task made.
[11:35.640 --> 11:39.480]  It's on Daniel's shelf. Much love and respect to the big D miss you, bro.
[11:39.480 --> 11:41.080]  Hope to see you soon. Let's get you on the podcast.
[11:42.440 --> 11:45.640]  So I really don't think that that number correlates. I think like Mike said,
[11:45.960 --> 11:49.000]  that's definitely not a temperature when you get in your car or whatever,
[11:49.080 --> 11:52.280]  where you like it, where you really like to jam out when your favorite song comes
[11:52.280 --> 11:55.320]  on, when born to be wild comes on and you want to drive on the freeway way too
[11:55.320 --> 11:58.960]  fast, whatever, like 2339, whatever it is.
[11:59.920 --> 12:01.840]  Decibels. That's just a random number.
[12:03.040 --> 12:05.480]  It had something for you to think about medium high,
[12:05.480 --> 12:06.840]  right before it starts crackling.
[12:09.640 --> 12:10.880]  I like to take my dad's kind of hot.
[12:11.200 --> 12:14.240]  I like the email a little hotter than most people. When Spence would come over,
[12:14.360 --> 12:16.680]  shout out to Spencer from the garden of weed immediately turn it down.
[12:17.520 --> 12:19.960]  He wouldn't even ask. He'd be like, you don't nail too hot dog. And just re,
[12:19.960 --> 12:21.840]  he didn't say dog. He would call me the N word.
[12:22.080 --> 12:25.000]  You're nailed too high N word and reach over and just turn my shit down.
[12:25.000 --> 12:28.080]  Like it was his. And I wouldn't argue because that's Spencer and he made the hash
[12:28.120 --> 12:29.880]  we're about to dab. So I'm just gonna let him do his thing.
[12:30.680 --> 12:32.920]  But he would always turn it the fuck down. He'd be like my stuff.
[12:33.640 --> 12:36.600]  It always says esophagus. So he turned that fucker down.
[12:37.040 --> 12:41.080]  I take pretty low temp dabs at home every now and then I undershoot it.
[12:41.080 --> 12:45.240]  Or like I sneeze between heating the nail with the torch and going to dab and
[12:45.240 --> 12:47.160]  then find it's a little too cold. And I puddle,
[12:47.600 --> 12:52.240]  I will I like a big chunky dad. So I feel like you have to overheat.
[12:52.240 --> 12:54.440]  You have to have it. It's not even overheating.
[12:54.440 --> 12:57.680]  It's just hot enough to cook all that. Otherwise I'm sucking like four dabs.
[12:58.680 --> 13:00.840]  Back in the day, bro, we used to go way.
[13:01.240 --> 13:04.080]  That skillet glows like the sun. You keep heating.
[13:04.240 --> 13:06.320]  I saw a dead and co I saw the grateful,
[13:06.320 --> 13:09.360]  the remaining members of the grateful dead Phil Lesh doesn't tour anymore.
[13:09.360 --> 13:13.600]  So they call themselves dead and co. Uh, I saw dead and co at in Boulder.
[13:14.000 --> 13:17.360]  A shout out to my friend that took me to that show, but I saw the dead in Boulder.
[13:17.720 --> 13:21.520]  And fucking, there were some kids taking dabs in the back of this SUV.
[13:21.520 --> 13:24.360]  They had the tailgate up and they had the dab rig sitting up on a little thing
[13:24.360 --> 13:27.480]  so that all they had to do was put it to their face and the dude heats it with
[13:27.480 --> 13:30.480]  a torch. And I'm just walking toward this car, walking through rows,
[13:30.480 --> 13:32.080]  walking through the parking lot. And I see him just,
[13:34.520 --> 13:37.120]  and I was like, it's hot. Like you can fucking stop.
[13:37.480 --> 13:39.960]  Turn and turn that nail into fucking water right now.
[13:40.280 --> 13:42.280]  And I didn't say anything. It was none of my business. I was like, Oh,
[13:42.280 --> 13:45.400]  he's going to put the dome on or whatever and let it cool. Nah, bro.
[13:45.480 --> 13:49.120]  I did through the dome on and fucking put that dabber to that nail while it was
[13:49.120 --> 13:53.040]  glowing bright orange. And I just cringed. I was like, Oh my God.
[13:53.080 --> 13:56.360]  Like it was not my place to say anything, but my heart just tingled. I was like,
[13:56.360 --> 13:58.840]  Oh God, that for poor fucking Deb.
[13:59.000 --> 14:02.320]  It's a not only are you ruining yourself for no reason,
[14:02.320 --> 14:04.880]  you're also losing so much of the flavor.
[14:05.680 --> 14:08.440]  The turps man burning the turps.
[14:09.560 --> 14:11.760]  The downside is if you undershoot it,
[14:11.760 --> 14:14.080]  you end up just wasting your hash on the nail.
[14:14.080 --> 14:16.440]  It puddles instead of vaporizes and that's sad.
[14:16.520 --> 14:20.160]  In our world. So that's, let me, let me talk about that. When I taught,
[14:20.160 --> 14:22.640]  when I hit the email, when I'm taking a big fat dab,
[14:22.640 --> 14:25.080]  a lot of times you guys I come home from work and I want to dab like a half
[14:25.120 --> 14:28.200]  gram, maybe a gram of hash in one fucking dab. I'm not kidding. Uh,
[14:28.240 --> 14:29.720]  there are more people in this room. They'll wait,
[14:29.760 --> 14:32.600]  raise their hands and fucking testify. Rasta. Jeff will pull a grandma, dad,
[14:32.600 --> 14:36.400]  granddad. No problem. Yeah. We got hands up testify. So, uh,
[14:36.960 --> 14:39.360]  but again, I like to take a big fat dab. I will do that on the email.
[14:39.720 --> 14:42.080]  A lot of times when I'm smoking these turps and the distillate,
[14:42.120 --> 14:46.880]  I bust out this one right here. My elevate the line cycler with a little banger on
[14:46.880 --> 14:49.960]  it. Yeah. It's got a, they say it's courts. I bet you money. That's fucking glass.
[14:50.360 --> 14:53.120]  Uh, I got a little glass of banger on there. That's my flavor saver.
[14:53.120 --> 14:57.200]  I think it tastes a little bit better. I think, uh, courts versus tie.
[14:57.520 --> 15:01.600]  I think sometimes I've got to say that the courts tastes a little bit better in
[15:01.600 --> 15:02.440]  my opinion.
[15:02.760 --> 15:03.600]  I, uh,
[15:04.040 --> 15:07.920]  I have that on my short list of things I want to treat myself with is a nice
[15:07.920 --> 15:08.760]  quartz banger.
[15:09.800 --> 15:12.920]  I really dig. I'm do this one here.
[15:13.080 --> 15:17.280]  This is a highly educated titanium base with a court's dish on top.
[15:17.360 --> 15:20.480]  I saw some of that on Instagram and didn't let myself look.
[15:20.480 --> 15:22.360]  Cause I was doing car repairs at the time.
[15:23.040 --> 15:26.320]  I like myself that likes to travel with a little rig like that.
[15:26.360 --> 15:29.080]  That's the way to go. Cause this banger, the way that I travel with it,
[15:29.080 --> 15:30.600]  that would get destroyed quickly.
[15:30.640 --> 15:35.160]  Well, uh, where, where my dad rig sits most of the time, that would be safe.
[15:36.360 --> 15:39.600]  Like I can't risk the email right now, but I could risk the bucket.
[15:39.760 --> 15:41.760]  The puppy could take the bucket, but not the email.
[15:41.800 --> 15:45.400]  Well, it's safer. It's the cord. That's the problem on the email.
[15:46.160 --> 15:50.480]  Like just in practice. I know my, my household well enough to me,
[15:50.600 --> 15:52.600]  to know that that rig would get yanked off.
[15:52.600 --> 15:54.720]  That court is dangerous at this table, right?
[15:54.880 --> 15:59.080]  That court is knocked over and broken this exact rig once before just sitting
[15:59.080 --> 16:02.320]  there, it just wobbled and spun itself over. Cause the, you guys,
[16:02.320 --> 16:05.280]  the court on this email is it's was coiled in a box for a hundred years.
[16:05.280 --> 16:08.440]  It looks like and shipped from fucking China and vacuum packed.
[16:08.440 --> 16:10.920]  And so it's going to be coily shaped for the rest of his life.
[16:11.280 --> 16:13.720]  And sometimes you try to straighten it out and it makes you think it went
[16:13.720 --> 16:15.720]  straight, but then it just starts coiling.
[16:15.720 --> 16:19.840]  So it's up and it winded itself up and tip your rig over. So, uh,
[16:20.120 --> 16:22.000]  turn your email off when you leave the house.
[16:22.040 --> 16:24.080]  That's a reminder to myself also, you know,
[16:24.080 --> 16:26.880]  have no idea how many times I've come home and been like, Oh shit,
[16:26.880 --> 16:29.520]  never leave the house with an active heat source running like that.
[16:29.560 --> 16:32.520]  It's just kind of basic human. Uh,
[16:32.520 --> 16:36.560]  so low temp is better when I'm doing a small dab is what I wanted to kind of
[16:36.560 --> 16:39.440]  take that email versus the courts, the titanium versus courts.
[16:39.440 --> 16:42.400]  If I'm doing a nice thing about the courts is you can bring that temp down even
[16:42.400 --> 16:45.760]  further. Just let it cool. Get it, get it glowy hot and let it go. Don't,
[16:45.920 --> 16:49.680]  cause don't be that. Never do be that guy. Shout out to Jason Margulies.
[16:49.880 --> 16:52.640]  I got so many friends that'll heat the nail until it's glowing orange and bust
[16:52.640 --> 16:55.680]  out a fucking timer. And they have timed exactly like from what it glows right
[16:55.680 --> 16:59.800]  here, bro. You hit go and wait this many seconds. Perfect fucking dab, bro.
[17:00.400 --> 17:03.080]  Like, yeah, I'm always like, no, you waited too long.
[17:03.160 --> 17:05.200]  I should have gotten seven seconds sooner than that.
[17:05.200 --> 17:07.080]  Cause it's too cool for me. I like it a little warm,
[17:07.280 --> 17:11.040]  but if I'm trying to dab these turps all oftentimes go for the courts and go low
[17:11.080 --> 17:15.480]  temp, low temp. They, we say you got to taste it to waste it. Uh,
[17:15.520 --> 17:19.080]  hit it low temp, carb cap it, just get all that flavor in there.
[17:19.080 --> 17:22.480]  Take a little tiny dab and then grab a Q-tip and heat the nail just a little
[17:22.480 --> 17:25.960]  bit and clean it out with the Q-tip. And now you got a fresh banger again.
[17:25.960 --> 17:28.440]  They call that the Q-tip tech. I don't play that way.
[17:28.480 --> 17:31.720]  I heat the fuck out of it until it's clean. And then I throw another dab in it.
[17:32.200 --> 17:33.720]  That's that's how I roll with the banger.
[17:34.120 --> 17:36.920]  I'm not on the Q-tip tech and the low temp tech, all that.
[17:37.200 --> 17:40.520]  I like to take a fat dab and get it on. Right. Uh, my buddy, Adam,
[17:40.520 --> 17:44.960]  he'll would say a red means go eat the fuck out of it and just throws a mad dab
[17:44.960 --> 17:49.880]  in there. No, I can't. It's a, it's too much on my throat. Yeah.
[17:49.920 --> 17:52.920]  Low temp is better for you. Low temp is better. Uh, fine.
[17:53.240 --> 17:55.160]  So guys, when you're trying to set the temperature to your email,
[17:55.160 --> 17:57.960]  everyone's like, what temperature do I set it? Go ahead, Mike.
[17:57.960 --> 17:58.840]  You got something to jump in with.
[17:59.360 --> 18:04.360]  I was going to say that's the right setup is really key to getting the most out
[18:04.840 --> 18:09.280]  of your hash. You, you can take a really nice low temp dab, um,
[18:09.320 --> 18:12.600]  on an email and with the carb cap, you don't waste anything.
[18:12.600 --> 18:15.840]  There's even if you go really low,
[18:16.200 --> 18:20.120]  it's still going to continuously heat that surface and vaporize everything off.
[18:20.440 --> 18:24.200]  You've got it carb capped. Even if it takes a second to get it done,
[18:24.280 --> 18:29.280]  you're not going to lose anything. You can actually enjoy all of that. Um,
[18:29.360 --> 18:30.840]  and it just,
[18:31.000 --> 18:34.160]  it's one of those things where it takes the time and investing in the right
[18:34.160 --> 18:37.080]  tools to really get the best bang out of your product.
[18:37.800 --> 18:40.280]  And that's part of the reason I ended up so baked here is cause I've only got
[18:40.280 --> 18:44.280]  like half the pieces at home. And so, um, when I low temp it,
[18:44.280 --> 18:46.600]  I end up losing a good bit off the top of my nail.
[18:46.600 --> 18:49.040]  And so I'm taking small dabs anyway. You got to clean it up.
[18:49.320 --> 18:51.800]  I noticed that the first stab, every time I come over here,
[18:51.800 --> 18:56.600]  I cough way harder than I have in a week or two. Um,
[18:56.680 --> 18:59.520]  and then I get a little bit higher than I've been in a week or two.
[19:00.360 --> 19:04.280]  I think is because I use a smaller rig than most folks. Yeah.
[19:04.440 --> 19:06.600]  My rig's a little bit bigger. I really like,
[19:06.600 --> 19:10.720]  I prefer a smaller rig and I prefer an email on a small rig right now.
[19:10.720 --> 19:14.400]  I'm hitting the hitman, a sidecar, the E-series sidecar,
[19:14.800 --> 19:18.360]  this whole rig is small to the point and it heats to the point where he's got to
[19:18.360 --> 19:22.000]  keep an eye on the water level. Cause it will cook itself dry. Yeah. Yeah.
[19:22.040 --> 19:24.000]  That that has happened before. Uh,
[19:24.120 --> 19:28.280]  my mad Rob is like fucking four inches tall. I love these little rigs.
[19:28.280 --> 19:30.800]  I like this one itself. Rod during a podcast.
[19:31.280 --> 19:34.680]  We've seen that happen before and you caught it before you shot it to sloppy,
[19:34.680 --> 19:38.560]  taking a dry dab, uh, this elevate client, it's taller,
[19:38.600 --> 19:42.440]  but it's still got very, uh, a very minimal amount of airspace.
[19:42.440 --> 19:43.080]  And that's it.
[19:43.080 --> 19:46.960]  I don't want a lot of space from the time that I put my dab on the surface of
[19:46.980 --> 19:49.760]  this dad nail for it to go down here, down this tube,
[19:49.760 --> 19:54.240]  into the water and into my face. I want as little resistance as possible.
[19:54.240 --> 19:57.760]  I just want to get that dab into my brain. Just give it to me.
[19:58.120 --> 20:01.440]  And I feel like all the percolators and all the extra bubbles and shit,
[20:01.460 --> 20:04.720]  that's just stealing your dad, stealing your turps, stealing your flavor.
[20:04.760 --> 20:06.280]  I don't want all that extra bubble edge.
[20:06.520 --> 20:09.280]  I want enough water just to cool it down from hitting that nail.
[20:09.320 --> 20:13.120]  And then let me get it. I actually took dabs today, uh,
[20:13.160 --> 20:17.040]  through this little rig without enough water in it. And I got ultra high,
[20:18.520 --> 20:20.560]  that's stupid. I, cause it didn't have enough water and it was,
[20:20.560 --> 20:23.400]  it kind of, it was kind of Bernie. It made my throat tingle a little bit,
[20:23.400 --> 20:25.160]  but Holy shit. I was red eyed.
[20:25.880 --> 20:29.960]  The first time I used a really good portable hash pen,
[20:30.400 --> 20:32.040]  they never last for very long.
[20:32.040 --> 20:36.160]  But the first time I used one that gave you like that first dozen hits, well,
[20:37.240 --> 20:40.080]  um, burn the fuck out of my throat. Yeah. Yeah. Um,
[20:41.160 --> 20:44.440]  percolation tastes like hot plastic. Um, no,
[20:44.440 --> 20:47.800]  it was a different company still tasted like hot plastic because the mouthpiece
[20:47.800 --> 20:52.280]  was plastic. But, uh, um, fuck dude, that burn lasted all week.
[20:53.120 --> 20:55.000]  I got the throat burn for a week.
[20:55.200 --> 20:58.400]  So remember like when you stayed at a bong you'd fill it and you get it full and
[20:58.400 --> 21:01.360]  you'd keep sucking and that chamber would fill and you keep sucking and all your
[21:01.360 --> 21:03.400]  friends would like, pull it, pull it. And you look at them like, Nope,
[21:03.400 --> 21:05.720]  I'm going to get high as fuck. I'm taking a big ass bong it.
[21:06.080 --> 21:08.280]  And then you pull it and then all that smoke goes in your head.
[21:08.760 --> 21:11.640]  That's the point of a big pipe or a big bong or a big rig.
[21:11.720 --> 21:15.360]  Fill that fucker up and then carve it and get smoke. If you notice a dab rig,
[21:15.480 --> 21:18.520]  there's no carb. Uh, you just want that fucking smoke.
[21:18.800 --> 21:19.160]  You know what I mean?
[21:19.160 --> 21:22.560]  You throw the carb cap on to trap the heat in the nail and put a little vacuum
[21:22.560 --> 21:24.280]  in there. You got a little tiny hole in the carb cap.
[21:24.280 --> 21:26.680]  You get less air flowing through that heat stays in there.
[21:26.680 --> 21:29.280]  Every bit of air that comes through moves that oil around on the top of the
[21:29.280 --> 21:31.600]  nail and it goes into your brain and then you get stupid high.
[21:32.000 --> 21:35.880]  I don't feel the need to suck like a liter of oxygen through my bong before I
[21:35.880 --> 21:36.840]  start getting my,
[21:36.840 --> 21:40.160]  I'm not a fan of dab bongs and I know a lot of people that are,
[21:40.160 --> 21:42.400]  I sell an amazing nail that is,
[21:42.400 --> 21:46.120]  it's a beautiful six in one that's designed for rigs or bongs.
[21:46.520 --> 21:48.120]  It'll fit anything on the market.
[21:48.120 --> 21:50.480]  It's a copy of the highly educated infiniti now.
[21:50.520 --> 21:53.480]  I'm sure it is. It's a beautiful, beautiful invention.
[21:53.480 --> 21:55.280]  Completely is talking about.
[21:55.360 --> 21:59.040]  And every time I see it and I've got extra money in my pocket, I'm like,
[21:59.040 --> 22:01.480]  that's fucking so much. Um, um,
[22:01.520 --> 22:04.720]  but then I remember that I don't like dab bongs. Um,
[22:04.760 --> 22:08.080]  it's just way too much volume and I,
[22:08.440 --> 22:10.760]  you can see it on the inside of the glass. You're like,
[22:10.760 --> 22:14.360]  that's hash that's supposed to be my brain. It's not, it's on the side.
[22:14.680 --> 22:16.400]  And as much as you cough and choke anyway,
[22:16.400 --> 22:18.560]  you don't need to spend that extra energy on your lungs,
[22:18.560 --> 22:20.120]  pulling a liter of air up through your,
[22:20.960 --> 22:25.160]  I love a bong for flower. That's my primary smoking device.
[22:25.160 --> 22:28.040]  Clean my bong yesterday. Love it. Um,
[22:28.080 --> 22:32.080]  picked up flower today and yesterday because that's mainly what I've been
[22:32.080 --> 22:35.680]  smoking at home. Um, but for a nice dab,
[22:35.680 --> 22:37.320]  you gotta go with a smaller rig.
[22:37.800 --> 22:40.760]  Yeah. I prefer when you started talking about flower,
[22:40.760 --> 22:42.640]  maybe you want to segue into something else that I wrote down.
[22:42.640 --> 22:45.840]  I prefer Indica flowers. If I was going to go shopping,
[22:45.840 --> 22:46.760]  like right here on the table,
[22:46.760 --> 22:48.560]  I've got some blue Sherb that I grew at the greener,
[22:48.560 --> 22:52.640]  healthy wellness garden. I smell so yummy. And then here in this container,
[22:52.640 --> 22:56.560]  I got some Jeff's OG that I grew. These are both heavy Indica dominant strains.
[22:57.760 --> 23:01.880]  This one just has like that. And gorgeous. Well done, sir. Thank you.
[23:01.880 --> 23:04.440]  This so far is my proudest grow in this garden,
[23:04.440 --> 23:07.160]  but wait until you see the next couple of runs. I'm already impressed,
[23:07.560 --> 23:10.960]  but I prefer these Indica dominant flowers. The sit you down, chill you out,
[23:10.960 --> 23:14.640]  cushy, piney, uh, dank flavored flowers.
[23:14.640 --> 23:16.840]  I'm going to roll a joint with that and I'm going to smoke it.
[23:17.160 --> 23:20.560]  And it's just going to taste earthy and funky and coffee-like.
[23:20.640 --> 23:24.000]  But then when it comes to my dabs, if you notice all my dab selection,
[23:24.280 --> 23:27.680]  everything over here is like candy flavors and should I like the cactus cooler?
[23:27.920 --> 23:31.560]  And over here, this one doesn't even have a label anymore. Whatever that was. Uh,
[23:31.560 --> 23:33.800]  we got some of the blue Sherb, of course, the solvent list.
[23:33.800 --> 23:35.880]  We got super lemon Hays over here. Uh,
[23:35.920 --> 23:38.480]  this one is called Creek Kush because obviously like those Kush Terps.
[23:38.600 --> 23:41.920]  I've been going super heavy citrus lately for a while.
[23:41.920 --> 23:44.320]  The only exceptions, the Durban, which is all pine.
[23:44.360 --> 23:49.240]  I was building up to the lemon G. Oh, there's nothing like lemon G Terps.
[23:49.720 --> 23:53.880]  Uh, the flavor of lemon G live resin in my face. Like if I could,
[23:54.160 --> 23:57.600]  if I can only dab, I don't know that lemon G would be my one and only,
[23:57.600 --> 24:00.440]  but if I had to pick three strains that I had to dab for the rest of my life,
[24:00.440 --> 24:01.920]  lemon G would be in that mix.
[24:02.240 --> 24:04.560]  I may have to replace it with lemon Jeffrey though. I'm not sure.
[24:04.560 --> 24:06.960]  I'd have to set them side by side, take tabs and pick about that.
[24:07.600 --> 24:10.880]  No, I've been going sweet for a while. I'm usually go, uh, uh,
[24:10.920 --> 24:14.120]  it's been a few Lee for a while and I just went all sweet the last six months.
[24:14.160 --> 24:17.640]  You like the fuel? Yup. That's that heavy diesel flavor.
[24:17.640 --> 24:20.560]  I've loved since the early two thousands. I can't get away from it.
[24:20.600 --> 24:24.960]  Is that in your dabs or your flowers? Both. Okay. Um, I'm,
[24:25.240 --> 24:28.160]  you know me, I love the sour diesel. Yeah. Yeah. Um,
[24:28.320 --> 24:31.520]  sour diesel live resin. So tasty. I've got a little at home right now.
[24:31.520 --> 24:35.320]  I've been treating myself with, I don't enjoy sour diesel concentrates at all.
[24:35.320 --> 24:38.320]  Remember one time I ended up with some sour diesel concentrates on accident and
[24:38.320 --> 24:39.200]  I'm pretty sure I ended up,
[24:40.920 --> 24:44.960]  ended up at my place. Yeah. Yeah. Cause I just don't care for that flavor.
[24:44.960 --> 24:46.400]  Also good. I saved it.
[24:46.400 --> 24:49.440]  I use it as treats for like when I did shit around the house that I didn't want
[24:49.440 --> 24:52.440]  to do at all. I hate to say it, but like done and then live resin,
[24:52.440 --> 24:56.160]  some Kanji or some Jilly bean dabs. Oh God, I'm a junkie bro.
[24:56.280 --> 24:59.160]  I've got some straw banana live resident home. That's really good.
[24:59.320 --> 25:02.680]  Strawberry, uh, strawberry, banana, tangy, the SBT brother.
[25:02.680 --> 25:05.920]  Everybody seems to be going goo goo over the strawberry, banana, tangy stuff,
[25:05.920 --> 25:09.560]  from Crockett. Shout out to Crockett for making killer killer seeds. Uh,
[25:09.600 --> 25:11.200]  it's funny how, uh,
[25:11.240 --> 25:14.920]  being a breeder and somebody that works in a large scale cultivation facility,
[25:15.240 --> 25:20.160]  seeing the difference in buds that are grown in plants that are grown for flower
[25:20.160 --> 25:23.720]  production and plants that are grown specifically for oil production.
[25:24.080 --> 25:29.080]  We've got a cut that we gave it to somebody in another state and they grew it.
[25:29.080 --> 25:33.120]  And they grew it. And once they grew it out and saw it, they're like,
[25:33.120 --> 25:34.120]  fuck this plant.
[25:34.120 --> 25:38.400]  And they cut down all of the remaining plants of it and they sent the flowers to
[25:38.400 --> 25:42.400]  an extraction lab and that extraction lab was like, what the fuck did you send us?
[25:42.760 --> 25:45.800]  And like some cuts that we got from our friends in Colorado. That would be me.
[25:46.240 --> 25:49.320]  And they're like, what the fuck is this shit?
[25:49.440 --> 25:52.720]  And the extraction lab ran it and they called the guy up like, bro,
[25:52.720 --> 25:54.960]  you got to come over here. And the dude went over there and he took a dab of it.
[25:54.960 --> 25:57.080]  And he's like, this is the best fucking hash I've ever smoked.
[25:57.080 --> 26:00.480]  And like, this is the best hash anyone in this fucking building has ever smoked.
[26:00.480 --> 26:01.320]  Do you have any more?
[26:01.840 --> 26:05.360]  He made a sad face because he cut down all of the fucking plants that he had.
[26:05.360 --> 26:10.120]  Luckily I still have it. So it's still around. Uh, it's still here. Uh,
[26:10.160 --> 26:12.040]  but it's, it's ugly.
[26:12.120 --> 26:15.680]  I was having this conversation today. We live in the future here.
[26:16.520 --> 26:20.920]  We forget it so often here that for the rest of the country and for,
[26:21.440 --> 26:24.000]  uh, for sure the rest of the world, uh,
[26:24.000 --> 26:27.720]  when it comes to legal cannabis products or cannabis products, period,
[26:28.120 --> 26:31.320]  we have stuff that, I mean, if you guys went legal yesterday,
[26:31.320 --> 26:34.480]  you wouldn't see for five years, right? Um,
[26:34.840 --> 26:37.040]  this just takes that kind of time.
[26:37.040 --> 26:39.800]  This fucking strain will not finish for anything and it's ugly,
[26:39.800 --> 26:42.160]  but it makes the best oil, bro. So things are going to change.
[26:42.160 --> 26:43.400]  You're going to start seeing different,
[26:43.440 --> 26:45.320]  different types of plants grown for different things.
[26:45.320 --> 26:48.480]  We're growing specific shit at the grow right now that will only be made into
[26:48.480 --> 26:51.800]  oil. We've got strands that I will never let anybody see that flower.
[26:51.800 --> 26:55.360]  Cause they're ugly as shit. But the oil that comes out of it is tremendous.
[26:55.520 --> 26:57.440]  Like there's might be fucking up over again
[26:58.200 --> 27:01.000]  for a while now the hash has been stalled out.
[27:01.000 --> 27:05.280]  It just wax and shatter and butter and butters just basically wax.
[27:05.280 --> 27:09.000]  You, you kind of stumbled over if I'm not mistaken. Um,
[27:09.520 --> 27:13.480]  maybe I'm wrong for butter lovers. Sorry. Um, but, uh,
[27:13.560 --> 27:14.320]  that was it.
[27:14.320 --> 27:19.160]  And then live resin came along and people really started thinking about where can
[27:19.200 --> 27:20.920]  we go next with this? Yeah.
[27:21.120 --> 27:26.080]  And I love that people started playing with CO2 oil because there's a huge demand
[27:26.080 --> 27:27.680]  for that. Um,
[27:27.680 --> 27:31.320]  but then you're left with this goo in a syringe that's impossible to consume
[27:31.320 --> 27:31.640]  without.
[27:31.640 --> 27:34.880]  In the day I used to, I used to hate CO2 oil. I was like, nah,
[27:35.120 --> 27:36.400]  I hate that goopy shit.
[27:36.440 --> 27:40.200]  But it didn't taste right now that we've cleaned it up and it's now that they've
[27:40.200 --> 27:43.120]  cleaned it up. The taste is pretty good. Yeah. Um,
[27:43.160 --> 27:47.840]  and when it's further refined like this or separated completely and then you
[27:47.840 --> 27:51.360]  reconstitute it back on with your desk, like do it yourself style.
[27:51.440 --> 27:52.720]  It's a lot of fun.
[27:52.960 --> 27:55.600]  It is a lot of fun mixing up the little cocktails for yourself. I like,
[27:55.640 --> 27:58.200]  I've been just taking this shatter and dunking it straight into the turps all
[27:58.200 --> 28:02.200]  night. Um, it's the long expensive process.
[28:02.200 --> 28:05.960]  You guys don't even want to know. Um, but it's a lot of fun.
[28:05.960 --> 28:09.880]  The equipment alone. You could buy a house just for the nice ones. Yeah. Yeah.
[28:09.880 --> 28:11.920]  Just for the equipment. Um,
[28:12.800 --> 28:17.600]  but this isn't the only variety I've seen. There's a, a local, um,
[28:17.640 --> 28:22.680]  outfit that's been bringing samples by and their first two samples were
[28:22.680 --> 28:26.640]  Epic fails, like unmarketable, unsellable,
[28:27.400 --> 28:31.160]  not unsmokable way better than shit you're going to get in Florida. Um,
[28:31.200 --> 28:34.680]  did the name of the company have a family member in the name of the company?
[28:34.720 --> 28:39.200]  Okay. Um, but, uh, um, it was just not at all.
[28:39.200 --> 28:44.280]  Good, good concentrate ready to go. Like nothing about it was, was solid,
[28:44.760 --> 28:49.240]  but attempts three and four were, were really, really nice.
[28:49.320 --> 28:54.320]  Um, final products that are probably going to be really popular. Nice. Um,
[28:54.440 --> 28:56.680]  but I'm seeing a lot of that. Um,
[28:57.320 --> 29:00.840]  there's products that we get people asking by name and stuff.
[29:00.840 --> 29:03.280]  And like, I don't have people asking for the leafs by Snoop,
[29:03.920 --> 29:07.320]  but I do have people asking for new styles of hash that come out every couple
[29:07.320 --> 29:11.440]  of weeks. Nice. Yeah. Uh, when we send material out to a turpex,
[29:11.440 --> 29:14.840]  does all the extractions for us from the green. Oh, excuse me. Uh,
[29:14.840 --> 29:17.440]  turpex does all the extractions from the green and healthy wellness garden.
[29:17.440 --> 29:21.280]  And when we send out material, we send them a lot of fresh frozen material,
[29:21.520 --> 29:25.480]  but we send them a lot of dry material, the fresh frozen we can request.
[29:26.440 --> 29:28.960]  It's obviously going to be live resin. That's why it's fresh frozen.
[29:29.440 --> 29:31.520]  You didn't even dab in your coffin. You just thinking about it.
[29:31.520 --> 29:33.960]  Hit me a rant. I was looking at the hash over there. Like,
[29:35.040 --> 29:39.040]  and just got a random fresh frozen material out. Uh, we chopped down a plant,
[29:39.040 --> 29:42.280]  we cut it into small buds. We throw those buds into a freezer bags.
[29:42.480 --> 29:45.880]  Those freezer bags go directly into the freezer. They get frozen immediately.
[29:46.760 --> 29:48.680]  Uh, then we run to the store and get, uh,
[29:48.720 --> 29:51.760]  bags of ice and put those bags of ice into a giant cooler,
[29:51.760 --> 29:54.160]  put that frozen material into that cooler,
[29:54.160 --> 29:58.480]  drive that to a location where it is then turned into live resin.
[29:58.760 --> 30:02.920]  At that point, we can have it turned into live sap, live sugar. Uh,
[30:02.920 --> 30:06.760]  we can almost get a live shatter from some of the strains. Uh,
[30:06.760 --> 30:11.360]  the sour diesel won't live shatter. No, it's just two sugars. Yeah.
[30:12.400 --> 30:16.400]  So once you build a relationship with the extraction company or working with,
[30:16.400 --> 30:20.080]  we have two specific extractors that we talked to a lot that work with Turpex
[30:20.080 --> 30:21.280]  and we can tell them what we want.
[30:21.280 --> 30:24.040]  And they're like that strain is not going to do that or that strain is going to
[30:24.040 --> 30:24.840]  do that.
[30:24.840 --> 30:28.400]  And so we know that we can get triangle killer sugar and rude boy sap,
[30:28.400 --> 30:30.240]  like on consistent levels. Uh,
[30:30.280 --> 30:34.800]  the rude boy live resin sugar is one of my favorite fucking things to dab
[30:35.000 --> 30:38.640]  ever. It is so turpid delicate. The high is right where I want it.
[30:38.960 --> 30:40.760]  Like some things get you on the top of the head.
[30:40.760 --> 30:42.120]  Something like it's doing the back of the brain.
[30:42.120 --> 30:43.240]  Somebody feel on the shoulders.
[30:43.520 --> 30:46.360]  This rude boy hits me right in the eyes and in the forehead and it makes me
[30:46.360 --> 30:51.120]  dumb. It makes math skills go away. It just makes me goofy. He's like, dude,
[30:51.160 --> 30:54.920]  I like pot. They just fucking, I want cookies after I smoked that shit.
[30:55.880 --> 30:58.800]  Yeah. All right. So it is the seven, 10 episodes. You guys,
[30:58.800 --> 31:01.480]  we've been talking about seven, 10 for a whole long time. Uh,
[31:01.480 --> 31:06.000]  we should talk about the origin of seven, 10. Mike,
[31:06.000 --> 31:07.280]  do you have any idea where the number seven,
[31:07.280 --> 31:10.760]  10 came from why seven, 10 is one of this culture, part of this community.
[31:11.240 --> 31:14.480]  You flip it up upside down and dispose that oil. That is true.
[31:14.520 --> 31:18.360]  That's because a lot of the people that started this movement were of the age
[31:18.360 --> 31:23.240]  where they had beepers. Um, and that's about as far as I've bothered to follow it.
[31:23.280 --> 31:25.800]  All right. So seven, 10 is the new four 20.
[31:25.800 --> 31:29.400]  My friend Adam L coined the phrase seven, 10 is the new four 20. Uh,
[31:29.400 --> 31:30.880]  back in the day it was all about four 20.
[31:30.880 --> 31:33.400]  Let's get together at four 20 and smoke some weed. Now it's seven, 10.
[31:33.400 --> 31:36.520]  Let's get together at seven, 10. Take some dabs. Uh,
[31:36.520 --> 31:39.680]  if you turn seven, 10 upside down, it does say oil, uh,
[31:40.440 --> 31:42.120]  to the best of my knowledge,
[31:42.280 --> 31:45.640]  task rock is the person that created the phrase seven, 10.
[31:45.920 --> 31:49.480]  I think task rock and a couple other guys were either in a chat or on a
[31:49.480 --> 31:51.960]  conference call and they were talking about stuff. We need, they were like,
[31:51.960 --> 31:54.840]  we need something a little more bougie than four 20. Let's upgrade it.
[31:55.200 --> 31:56.320]  Let's do it with the hash.
[31:56.320 --> 31:58.000]  Well, this is the same time.
[31:58.560 --> 32:01.280]  Hash kids were separating from flower kids.
[32:01.440 --> 32:02.280]  Kind of. Yeah. Yeah.
[32:02.280 --> 32:06.720]  It's that my kids, I mean like full grown adults, but you know what I mean?
[32:06.720 --> 32:09.800]  Right. The, the, the hustler kids. Uh, so that's,
[32:10.040 --> 32:11.440]  that's where seven 10 came from.
[32:11.440 --> 32:15.280]  Seven 10 was coined as far as I know to the best of my knowledge.
[32:15.280 --> 32:16.520]  And I've done a little bit of research,
[32:16.520 --> 32:20.240]  but task rock and a couple other cats are the guys that coined the phrase seven,
[32:20.240 --> 32:25.600]  10. So they created seven, 10 shout out to task rock. Task rock of course is a,
[32:25.680 --> 32:28.240]  he's a rapper. Task rock has a couple of albums out.
[32:28.240 --> 32:32.120]  One of my favorite songs is probably first place. I like do it again. Uh,
[32:32.120 --> 32:36.000]  of course, boil that oil. He also does hits from the nail and task.
[32:37.440 --> 32:38.520]  Hash related music.
[32:38.520 --> 32:41.480]  I love to listen to some tasks and take some dabs or get dabbed out and drive
[32:41.480 --> 32:44.480]  around and listen to some tasks. Wait, I didn't, not like, I didn't say that.
[32:45.120 --> 32:48.040]  Hypothetically, I would like to get dabbed out and drive around as a passenger
[32:48.080 --> 32:49.680]  and listen to task. Uh,
[32:50.280 --> 32:55.040]  but can task rock is also the founder proprietor of this,
[32:55.040 --> 32:58.600]  the dude for highly educated titanium that's task rock.
[32:59.040 --> 33:03.200]  A lot of the times if you go to a cannabis cup event in California, Colorado,
[33:03.720 --> 33:05.520]  those are probably the ones he goes to. Uh,
[33:05.520 --> 33:09.080]  if you go to those cannabis cup events and you go to the highly educated booth
[33:09.080 --> 33:10.720]  to purchase some highly educated products,
[33:10.720 --> 33:14.120]  you were probably going to pay your money to task rock directly.
[33:14.120 --> 33:15.720]  He will be the dude there that helps you out.
[33:16.080 --> 33:19.920]  So task is integral in the seven 10 community integral in the seven 10
[33:19.920 --> 33:21.760]  movement. He's been a big part of it since the beginning.
[33:21.760 --> 33:25.480]  He's a huge supporter. A shout out to task. Task made up the number seven 10,
[33:25.480 --> 33:27.280]  not the number, but the phrase seven 10.
[33:27.640 --> 33:32.000]  And that Mike stands kind of might need a little bit of my, my gut droopy.
[33:32.040 --> 33:35.120]  We had a quick equipment. It might be done.
[33:35.400 --> 33:38.040]  You might just have to hold it. You might need to give it a minute.
[33:38.200 --> 33:41.280]  Just give it a minute. Give it a Gatorade. I got you, buddy.
[33:43.560 --> 33:46.320]  Don't worry, Mike. There happens to be Gatorade on the table. Yeah.
[33:46.360 --> 33:48.880]  Just give it a rest. It'll be all right. Just don't talk about it.
[33:49.040 --> 33:52.360]  I just don't look at it. It'll be fine. Just, just ignore it for a minute.
[33:52.360 --> 33:55.400]  It'll work again in a second. All right. So shout out to our boy task.
[33:55.400 --> 33:59.800]  Rock seven 10 is a new four 20 shout out to Adam L uh, without task rock.
[33:59.800 --> 34:02.160]  I don't know. Uh, and uh,
[34:02.360 --> 34:05.640]  big D is the person that gave me my very first dab.
[34:05.640 --> 34:08.840]  So I want to give a shout out to big D at the time he was with Broadway
[34:08.840 --> 34:11.080]  wellness. He moved on to be top shelf extracts.
[34:11.080 --> 34:15.040]  Big D moved on to be the founder and proprietor of the secret cup,
[34:15.160 --> 34:16.880]  not the secret session, the secret cup,
[34:16.880 --> 34:20.240]  the one with the dragon and the logo. Uh, the first hash competition,
[34:20.240 --> 34:25.120]  I think I ever attended. First one I ever heard about. Yeah. Yeah. So, um,
[34:25.160 --> 34:28.480]  I think task, I think big D I think Adam ill, uh,
[34:28.480 --> 34:29.800]  the guys from health stone glass.
[34:29.800 --> 34:32.400]  And of course I'm going to give a little bit of credit to hit man glass Dougie
[34:32.400 --> 34:35.600]  because he does make the rigs that a lot of us are purchasing and smoking our
[34:35.600 --> 34:39.240]  hash through. So a lot of those guys are pioneers of the industry,
[34:39.560 --> 34:43.640]  old school folks, uh, in Colorado, uh,
[34:43.680 --> 34:46.520]  in the hash movement. Uh, Spence did a lot.
[34:46.560 --> 34:49.440]  I want to give a huge shout out to Spence and the garden, the weed and crew,
[34:49.920 --> 34:52.960]  uh, kind bill, that whole crew, they did a lot in the hash,
[34:52.960 --> 34:57.200]  but honestly we all owe a huge high five to Derek Cummings.
[34:57.440 --> 35:01.280]  Uh, fuck Derek. That dude did so much for hash. I know that's fine.
[35:01.280 --> 35:03.040]  It's an inside joke, but hashtag fuck Derek.
[35:03.040 --> 35:06.240]  It was just kind of an inside joke with all of his friends. Uh,
[35:06.240 --> 35:09.120]  but Derek did a lot for learning about hash. Uh,
[35:09.120 --> 35:11.640]  Derek did a lot of research and learned a whole lot about hash.
[35:11.680 --> 35:14.200]  Uh, Derek did a lot of research and learned a whole lot of shit.
[35:14.440 --> 35:16.680]  And then of course there's Tony V. Uh,
[35:16.680 --> 35:18.760]  there's a whole bunch of guys doing stuff for hashing turps,
[35:19.080 --> 35:23.160]  but shout out to all the people that helped get seven 10 popular originated that
[35:23.160 --> 35:25.320]  shit. TaskRock. We're going to play TaskRock at the end of the show.
[35:25.520 --> 35:27.160]  The, uh, the original people,
[35:27.320 --> 35:31.680]  the original many people involved in keeping it. It is what it is today.
[35:32.680 --> 35:34.920]  Um, it's been fun to watch it grow.
[35:35.160 --> 35:38.680]  It goes so rapidly with now that it's legal that we can do whatever we want with
[35:38.720 --> 35:42.640]  this. Uh, the equipment, the products have just every couple of months,
[35:42.640 --> 35:45.880]  I got to go buy all new shit just to have what I need to have to be on top of
[35:45.880 --> 35:46.240]  things.
[35:46.240 --> 35:51.240]  It's like any other tech right now. Every six months it evolves two to three
[35:51.680 --> 35:55.280]  times faster and more effective than it was before.
[35:55.440 --> 35:57.160]  The turps are available by themselves.
[35:57.160 --> 36:01.200]  Every part of the legal marijuana industry, which is fun to watch. Um,
[36:01.240 --> 36:04.120]  we got a huge variety products about a year and a half ago.
[36:04.440 --> 36:08.640]  They're all getting really, really, really good now. Um,
[36:09.440 --> 36:13.040]  it's just so much fun to see you guys got to legalize it where you live.
[36:14.080 --> 36:16.800]  Remember when I was like the only one that had little jars of turps on the
[36:16.800 --> 36:20.040]  table? Yeah, you probably will be for a while.
[36:20.360 --> 36:23.600]  There's a lot of people out there now. Uh, they're available at a lot of shops.
[36:23.800 --> 36:28.160]  A lot of people are eating them up, eating them up. It's a, I really, I,
[36:28.160 --> 36:29.640]  it's a whole new thing. I really love it.
[36:29.960 --> 36:33.400]  A lot of people are probably like where the fuck are turps? Uh, turps are
[36:34.120 --> 36:34.960]  turpenoids.
[36:35.960 --> 36:40.560]  Turpenoids are the compounds that mainly provide the flavor and aroma
[36:40.960 --> 36:44.920]  to your cannabis and or cannabis concentrates. They are,
[36:44.960 --> 36:47.680]  they're part of the flavor.
[36:47.680 --> 36:49.960]  The paleoids and the esters have a lot to do with the flavor.
[36:49.960 --> 36:52.160]  The flavonoids have a lot to do with the flavor, obviously,
[36:52.160 --> 36:56.560]  but the turpenoids are mainly what play the part of the flavor that work on your
[36:56.560 --> 37:00.200]  tongue. That's mostly the part that you get. They also contribute to your high.
[37:00.520 --> 37:03.600]  I think that the OG Kush one makes me a little more mellow.
[37:03.600 --> 37:06.160]  It gives me a body thing. It kind of makes my body go.
[37:06.160 --> 37:09.280]  Wong, Wong, Wong, Wong, Wong. And the ghost train Hayes makes my head go.
[37:10.880 --> 37:12.840]  Like I just dabbed a fucking bottle rocket.
[37:13.080 --> 37:17.720]  Well, essentially that's what's separates Indica from Sativa is what you've
[37:17.720 --> 37:22.720]  refined into that tiny little jar. Um, it's everything around the THC.
[37:23.760 --> 37:27.680]  Um, there's, there's some other stuff that goes into that, but yeah,
[37:28.120 --> 37:31.920]  it's, it, if you had to describe somebody to somebody,
[37:32.280 --> 37:33.560]  if you had to show them strongly,
[37:33.560 --> 37:35.520]  this is the difference between Indica and Sativa.
[37:35.520 --> 37:37.840]  That would definitely be a good way to do it. Just take that.
[37:38.160 --> 37:39.960]  Those two is let them try that.
[37:42.440 --> 37:44.040]  Oh, you're way too high. Watch. Try this one.
[37:44.840 --> 37:46.480]  Just put them to bed with the OG Kush.
[37:46.880 --> 37:50.080]  No, their problem was I'm way too high. I wouldn't give them another dab.
[37:50.120 --> 37:54.240]  I'd give them a dab of some really CBD heavy. Yeah. Some CBD heavy dabs.
[37:54.240 --> 37:55.520]  And it would call them the fuck down.
[37:55.520 --> 37:56.560]  Cherry flavor, bud.
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.360]  All right. All this talk about dabs has got me wanting to dab.
[38:00.360 --> 38:02.960]  So I've got some of this mob boss, uh, shatter,
[38:02.960 --> 38:05.360]  and I've dunked it into some ghost train Hayes turps.
[38:05.600 --> 38:07.160]  You can see the turps on the tip of the dab.
[38:07.160 --> 38:10.600]  It just looks like a little wet spot on there. Uh, I'm going to take a dab.
[38:10.600 --> 38:11.640]  Hey Mike, uh,
[38:11.680 --> 38:14.920]  tell all of our listeners how they can find you on social media and make sure
[38:14.920 --> 38:16.440]  you include your Facebook group.
[38:16.680 --> 38:21.680]  Um, you can catch me at Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws on Facebook or at
[38:21.680 --> 38:26.680]  Nemo punk 15 on Twitter. And that dad was massive.
[38:26.680 --> 38:28.640]  He's going to turn colors right now. It's going to be beautiful.
[38:30.280 --> 38:31.120]  I'm going to keep talking.
[38:31.960 --> 38:36.480]  You can turn colors without choking. I see. Now he's pasty white.
[38:36.480 --> 38:38.640]  Now he's going to red. It's a proper set.
[38:38.640 --> 38:41.040]  It'll be a shade of purple here in a couple of seconds. I feel like Kevin.
[38:42.240 --> 38:45.440]  Nice dark red and purple. I do it for the turps.
[38:47.760 --> 38:49.600]  Oh, it tastes amazing. It's just like having,
[38:50.280 --> 38:53.880]  I've always described a Hayes strains and the ghost train Hayes is really, uh,
[38:53.960 --> 38:55.720]  it's definitely stands out for what I'm talking about.
[38:55.760 --> 38:58.440]  There's like a velvet thing that happens on your tongue. It just feels like,
[38:59.200 --> 39:02.880]  like, you know, when you smell lilacs or lavender, there's that specific thing.
[39:03.080 --> 39:06.600]  There's, I, it almost has a similar coating like that that happens,
[39:06.600 --> 39:09.800]  but it's more enjoyable to me cause I fucking hate lilacs and lavender for
[39:09.800 --> 39:13.560]  some reason. I don't like the smell of that shit. It makes my nose feel like I got
[39:13.560 --> 39:14.400]  particles in my nose.
[39:14.400 --> 39:16.720]  Yeah. I don't like lavender when I'm surprised with it.
[39:17.200 --> 39:21.120]  Like if we check into a hotel to the room and it's all over,
[39:21.160 --> 39:22.960]  it drives me fucking nuts. Yeah.
[39:23.360 --> 39:26.040]  There's probably worse shit in that hotel room than that lavender, bro. No,
[39:26.040 --> 39:26.280]  I know,
[39:26.280 --> 39:29.960]  but it's the lavender that I've like choke on and can feel in my mouth for like
[39:29.960 --> 39:34.480]  the next hour. Like it's, it definitely has a coating. I, I don't know,
[39:34.480 --> 39:38.480]  maybe we're just equally high. Um, all right. Shout out to seven,
[39:38.480 --> 39:39.320]  10 shout out the task.
[39:39.320 --> 39:42.720]  There's something else I want to talk about on this episode that is not really a
[39:42.720 --> 39:46.920]  dab related, not really seven, 10 related, but it needs to be mentioned.
[39:47.760 --> 39:51.760]  Uh, amendment one 39 current event, bump, bump, bomb.
[39:52.040 --> 39:54.960]  There was a group, I don't know exactly who put this petition out.
[39:54.960 --> 39:59.960]  There was a group that was petitioning to limit all cannabis products to 16% THC.
[40:02.840 --> 40:06.160]  That's right. The buds that we grow at the green and healthy wellness,
[40:06.480 --> 40:11.360]  this shit tests anywhere from 20 to 30% THC. Uh, nothing is lower than 22.
[40:11.400 --> 40:14.440]  I wouldn't guess the average, uh,
[40:14.600 --> 40:19.360]  THC content in Colorado is 18 really who the fuck is growing that shit?
[40:19.760 --> 40:21.160]  Step it up people. Step it up.
[40:21.200 --> 40:26.200]  No, there's actually a pretty solid demand for stuff that's between like 12 and
[40:27.000 --> 40:31.360]  16% people that retired after 35 years doing shit.
[40:31.360 --> 40:34.240]  They were drug tested for. They really don't want our,
[40:34.240 --> 40:37.320]  our moonshine potency weed. Um,
[40:37.400 --> 40:40.520]  they freak out when they try to roll a joint of it and smoke it like they did
[40:40.560 --> 40:44.280]  back in 1974. Yeah, but they, they,
[40:44.280 --> 40:48.200]  they liked the whole like passive back and forth with their wife or whatever.
[40:48.200 --> 40:50.120]  I have a friend who writes. Yeah. So they,
[40:50.120 --> 40:52.000]  they like stuff that they can smoke on a little bit.
[40:52.000 --> 40:54.680]  Smoke on it and just have it burning while he's writing. Yeah, exactly.
[40:54.680 --> 40:59.040]  There is a call for that, but the average is, is 18. And so the, um,
[40:59.520 --> 41:03.000]  estimates are that this would have shut down 80% of the industry as we know it
[41:03.000 --> 41:03.320]  right now.
[41:03.320 --> 41:04.000]  I wouldn't want to,
[41:04.000 --> 41:07.600]  I would move to a place where I could grow high quality cannabis.
[41:07.720 --> 41:11.800]  Well, no, immediately all conscience rates gone. Most of the edibles gone.
[41:12.400 --> 41:15.800]  Um, most of the strains, we couldn't have gone.
[41:15.800 --> 41:18.880]  Most of the vapor cartridges gone. Um,
[41:18.920 --> 41:23.920]  like what's the point of a vapor cart that's 16% that would feel the black
[41:24.160 --> 41:27.400]  market so well. Um, yep. Uh,
[41:27.440 --> 41:32.440]  and that's the design is the people that were behind it wanted it to kill the
[41:32.840 --> 41:33.680]  industry.
[41:33.720 --> 41:38.720]  They know that a public vote to end amendment 64 statewide would die laughably.
[41:40.440 --> 41:41.280]  Um,
[41:41.640 --> 41:46.640]  and so this was their more reasonable attempt to give voters to go along with
[41:47.600 --> 41:50.640]  gutting the industry. So there were three parts to this.
[41:50.640 --> 41:54.320]  They were going to add childproof packaging, which we already do. Um,
[41:54.360 --> 41:58.280]  they wanted us to add a health warning that said this causes like irreparable
[41:58.280 --> 42:00.760]  brain damage or some shit. Um,
[42:00.840 --> 42:04.000]  we already do health warnings that are reasonable. Um,
[42:04.040 --> 42:06.640]  we're willing to add more reasonable health warnings,
[42:06.680 --> 42:11.400]  but we're not really to add some random bullshit that you just thought up. Um,
[42:11.560 --> 42:15.200]  and then it was going to limit potency to 16%. Um,
[42:15.240 --> 42:19.560]  the group behind this claims they have 80% of the public support on this.
[42:20.120 --> 42:23.720]  Um, what public where that they won't tell you,
[42:24.760 --> 42:26.160]  but they're pretty sure it exists.
[42:27.040 --> 42:28.760]  Didn't ask any dad kids.
[42:28.760 --> 42:32.680]  I think it's 80% of the people at the last anti-pop meeting. Yeah. Um,
[42:32.720 --> 42:35.320]  but 80% of the people in Parker, that's just from
[42:37.400 --> 42:41.280]  shout out to my hometown. Um, they, uh,
[42:42.280 --> 42:44.440]  um, they really, really want,
[42:44.480 --> 42:48.040]  hate marijuana and they wanted to shut us down this way. Um,
[42:48.040 --> 42:52.440]  they claim they have a huge amount of support, which is nonsense. Um, they, uh,
[42:52.480 --> 42:56.040]  they withdrew their effort today. They,
[42:56.040 --> 42:59.240]  they essentially said they're going to stop trying. Um,
[42:59.240 --> 43:02.880]  and the reason they stopped trying is kind of funny. Um,
[43:02.920 --> 43:07.840]  they claim that the group of marijuana industry
[43:07.840 --> 43:12.000]  supporters and businesses that formed to oppose this effort, um,
[43:12.040 --> 43:13.800]  called up all of the petitions,
[43:13.800 --> 43:17.840]  signature gathering companies in Colorado that are good at what they do and can
[43:17.840 --> 43:20.480]  actually get a statewide ballot, um,
[43:20.520 --> 43:22.800]  effort on the signatures collected.
[43:22.800 --> 43:27.480]  Cause it's like a hundred thousand or 98,000 signatures. It's a lot. Um,
[43:27.560 --> 43:30.760]  there are companies in Colorado that can definitely get that done for you.
[43:31.200 --> 43:33.920]  Apparently they all got a phone call from the marijuana people and they're like,
[43:33.920 --> 43:39.520]  we're going to hire you for this. Here's what you gotta do. Nothing. Um,
[43:39.560 --> 43:44.320]  go ahead and bill us and just hung up the phone and they
[43:44.320 --> 43:48.040]  raised enough money to apparently make that offer to the two biggest companies
[43:48.040 --> 43:50.840]  or three biggest companies in Colorado. And on the off chance,
[43:50.840 --> 43:52.880]  the anti-pop people tried to hire all three.
[43:52.880 --> 43:55.800]  They were prepared to pay all three to do nothing. Um,
[43:55.800 --> 43:59.240]  and so the anti-pop people were like, well, if we have to do this ourselves,
[43:59.600 --> 44:03.080]  we'll just go ahead and not do it. Nice. Um, which makes me laugh,
[44:03.080 --> 44:06.840]  especially when they're like, well, we have an 80% support of the public. Oh my
[44:06.840 --> 44:08.960]  God. Then it's so easy. You just,
[44:09.120 --> 44:12.080]  they kind of played old school drug dealer tactics though. I like that.
[44:12.120 --> 44:15.960]  You just pop it up on Facebook and uh, you say, Hey,
[44:15.960 --> 44:18.200]  community that supports this so much,
[44:18.240 --> 44:21.920]  we need all of you to grab a signature and take it to work the next day and say,
[44:21.920 --> 44:26.800]  Hey, sign this. The 80% of the, it's just such nonsense.
[44:27.080 --> 44:29.320]  Yeah. They didn't have 80% of them. No.
[44:29.320 --> 44:33.120]  And then they claimed that the marijuana industry raised tens and tens of
[44:33.120 --> 44:37.120]  millions of dollars to do this. And uh, the, this shit's public.
[44:37.120 --> 44:40.720]  All you have to do is know where to Google and you can check how much they
[44:40.720 --> 44:41.560]  raised. And it's like,
[44:41.560 --> 44:45.320]  for the sad part is that if you handed a petition to most people and you're
[44:45.320 --> 44:48.840]  like, Hey, would you like to limit the THC and cannabis to 16%?
[44:51.120 --> 44:53.920]  I don't even know what the fuck that means. Sure. They just signed.
[44:53.920 --> 44:56.640]  Like stop bugging me. If I sign, will you stop bugging me?
[44:56.800 --> 45:00.400]  Ring that fucking bell if I sign this. Yeah. Yeah. That's sucks.
[45:00.400 --> 45:02.080]  If people are just willing to sign shit too,
[45:02.080 --> 45:03.560]  without even knowing what they're talking about.
[45:03.560 --> 45:08.560]  Well, and by law you have to print the actual language that you're asking people
[45:08.960 --> 45:11.440]  to sign for across the top of the sheet they sign.
[45:11.840 --> 45:14.520]  It can't be a separate page or nothing. Like it's, it, there,
[45:14.640 --> 45:15.640]  there's a lot of rules.
[45:16.000 --> 45:19.040]  A lot of the people we've, we've discussed this before on the show.
[45:19.040 --> 45:21.920]  A lot of the people at Walmart are in their pajamas.
[45:22.600 --> 45:23.520]  Well, no, no, no.
[45:23.520 --> 45:25.040]  Nobody reads it even when you're,
[45:25.160 --> 45:28.320]  when you're out really collecting this stuff and trying to get people to give a
[45:28.320 --> 45:30.680]  shit. No one reads it. Yeah. They're just in a fucking hurry.
[45:30.720 --> 45:32.880]  They want to sign it and get you the hell out of there. Are you a resident?
[45:32.880 --> 45:36.600]  You live in the County 18 sign here, son here. That's pretty much what you get.
[45:38.800 --> 45:41.640]  For the most part. All right. So that shit got dropped. It did not pass you guys.
[45:41.760 --> 45:45.600]  They gave up because the group behind it is, uh,
[45:45.640 --> 45:48.600]  has pledged to reform, um,
[45:48.680 --> 45:51.680]  as a broader coalition of people, uh,
[45:51.680 --> 45:54.040]  uniting to fuck over the marijuana industry.
[45:54.080 --> 45:56.320]  I was going to say that just sounds like a whole bunch of bullshit,
[45:56.840 --> 46:00.000]  bunch of big words that they're lawyer type for them. Um, the,
[46:00.040 --> 46:03.680]  the funny part is, is a big part of their press release today. They're like, well,
[46:03.680 --> 46:07.800]  this former high school principal who was, who was behind this, said this,
[46:08.240 --> 46:12.560]  and this, this, the local parent who's behind the other person behind this said
[46:12.560 --> 46:13.400]  this,
[46:13.400 --> 46:16.960]  and I'm sitting there reading a press release from a major anti-marijuana
[46:16.960 --> 46:18.320]  personality in Oregon.
[46:18.720 --> 46:23.200]  And the press release talks about major funding from a national anti-marijuana
[46:23.200 --> 46:25.520]  group. And then if you keep reading the article,
[46:25.520 --> 46:29.640]  it talks about the actual people behind the initiative who aren't these local,
[46:29.640 --> 46:32.120]  lovable characters like a teacher and a parent.
[46:32.640 --> 46:37.640]  They're major politicians from around the country who make a living doing stuff
[46:38.120 --> 46:42.160]  like this. Um, but they're able to portray it as like, Oh, there's,
[46:42.200 --> 46:46.120]  there's just these little folks being picked on by big industry marijuana.
[46:46.760 --> 46:49.560]  It's like, do you threatened a billion dollar industry?
[46:49.560 --> 46:53.280]  And they raised 300 grand to knock you out of the fight. Like, come on now.
[46:54.160 --> 46:57.600]  So you just gave me a perfect segue before we start wrapping up the show. Uh,
[46:57.640 --> 47:01.640]  give me an update on what is going on with the effort to eliminate and or
[47:01.680 --> 47:04.280]  eradicate recreational cannabis from Pueblo County.
[47:04.640 --> 47:09.240]  Okay. So locally, um, our petition effort has, uh,
[47:09.680 --> 47:13.200]  been significantly more successful than the one statewide. Uh,
[47:13.240 --> 47:15.520]  there have all their signatures turned in.
[47:15.520 --> 47:19.160]  It looks like they've got more than enough valid signatures to make the ballot.
[47:19.760 --> 47:23.480]  Um, there's two questions in front of the courts right now.
[47:23.480 --> 47:27.320]  The first question is how many signatures they should have collected.
[47:27.840 --> 47:32.840]  They collected 5%, um, of the voter signatures from that last election down here,
[47:33.600 --> 47:38.520]  which was like 5,000 signatures. Um, they collected 9,000 almost.
[47:39.080 --> 47:43.320]  Um, and so they're covered there if it's 5%. Um,
[47:43.360 --> 47:48.080]  but recently a bill was passed at the state level requiring this specific
[47:48.080 --> 47:48.760]  question,
[47:48.760 --> 47:53.760]  if it's going to be put on a ballot anywhere to have 15% of past voter
[47:54.360 --> 47:56.040]  signatures, um,
[47:56.080 --> 47:59.680]  which would Jack that number to around 14 or 15,000,
[48:00.240 --> 48:04.240]  which means they don't have near enough signatures gathered and they need to get
[48:04.240 --> 48:06.920]  back out there and gather signatures. Uh,
[48:06.960 --> 48:11.840]  that decision should come any day now. Um, well, it's, uh,
[48:11.880 --> 48:16.080]  Friday when we're recording this, it'll be Sunday when it comes out.
[48:16.440 --> 48:21.440]  So it'll probably be within four or five days of this coming out when we get that
[48:21.440 --> 48:23.680]  decision, hopefully maybe as many as 15.
[48:23.760 --> 48:27.720]  But if you're Rasta said this will be Monday because he's from the future,
[48:27.720 --> 48:30.720]  Mase from the future. Um, but, uh,
[48:30.720 --> 48:34.920]  hopefully within seven or 10 days we get, we get that first decision about how,
[48:34.960 --> 48:38.200]  what, what percentage of the vote they should have gathered. Um,
[48:38.240 --> 48:42.920]  odds are strong that the judge is going to rule that 5% is fine. Um,
[48:42.960 --> 48:47.760]  recently we had a local politician make a primary ballot, um,
[48:47.800 --> 48:52.400]  and it ended up in front of the same judge and the judge's ruling was yes,
[48:52.640 --> 48:56.240]  he failed to follow the law here and here. Yes, he broke that rule there,
[48:56.640 --> 49:00.560]  but elections are about choices and why not give you guys him as one of those
[49:00.560 --> 49:04.160]  choices. And a lot of people were like, wait, what really?
[49:04.680 --> 49:09.680]  But kinda, I guess like the judge gets to make the rules.
[49:10.440 --> 49:14.880]  It's why they wear the outfit. Um, it's why they have the job.
[49:14.880 --> 49:18.000]  So let them make them. And that was the decision they made.
[49:18.000 --> 49:19.880]  So we're kind of expecting the same thing here.
[49:20.240 --> 49:25.000]  There's another court issue that involves some serious campaign finance stuff.
[49:26.080 --> 49:29.080]  Um, that could really keep them off the ballot. Um,
[49:29.120 --> 49:33.480]  Colorado and pretty much every state in the union has very serious laws that
[49:33.680 --> 49:36.040]  govern their elections. Um,
[49:36.080 --> 49:40.120]  when you would like to put something on an official election ballot,
[49:40.520 --> 49:41.880]  there are rules you must follow.
[49:42.520 --> 49:47.040]  The anti-marijuana people down here are terrible at following rules. Um,
[49:47.720 --> 49:52.520]  it's a very fun character trait for them to have if you're me. Um,
[49:52.560 --> 49:56.680]  so as soon as they said they were running a public ballot, I was hoping for,
[49:56.680 --> 49:58.440]  well, like, well, this is complicated.
[49:58.880 --> 50:00.520]  There's a lot of important ins and outs.
[50:00.520 --> 50:03.320]  And if you can't handle a licensing hearing at the County level,
[50:03.800 --> 50:08.640]  running a County wide ballot issue is probably going to trip you up.
[50:09.440 --> 50:12.000]  Um, and it looks like it has. Um,
[50:12.720 --> 50:16.320]  one of the things is you can't raise money in a jar to fundraiser.
[50:16.800 --> 50:20.840]  That's not a thing in politics. Um, if there's donations over $20,
[50:20.840 --> 50:24.040]  I gotta get your name. I got your serial number. Um,
[50:24.080 --> 50:25.520]  and that's just how elections go.
[50:25.520 --> 50:30.160]  The money is tracked like that unless you're super rich. Um,
[50:30.160 --> 50:32.120]  and by which case you invite,
[50:32.160 --> 50:35.240]  you can donate hundreds of millions of dollars to a company to run evil attack
[50:35.240 --> 50:39.640]  ads and shit. And that's fine. Um, but if you're a little guy trying to give $24,
[50:39.640 --> 50:41.560]  you gotta give me your name. It's your serial number.
[50:41.840 --> 50:46.080]  You can't just throw a jar up on the piano and at the end of the night have 300
[50:46.160 --> 50:50.080]  or a thousand bucks in there and call it good enough. So they did that twice.
[50:50.800 --> 50:54.760]  Um, and then there's major polling that they've bragged about.
[50:55.560 --> 50:58.040]  And, uh, most people don't understand what,
[50:58.400 --> 51:00.600]  what kind of money's involved when you're,
[51:01.040 --> 51:04.920]  when you poll people in a County like Pueblo, we're not a big County.
[51:04.920 --> 51:09.760]  There's only 150,000 people down here. A poll like that still costs 10, 15,
[51:09.760 --> 51:14.560]  20, $25,000. Um, the good ones cost 25, 35,
[51:14.560 --> 51:16.800]  $40,000. Um,
[51:16.840 --> 51:21.080]  the ones that'll really give you the information you want are expensive. Um,
[51:21.120 --> 51:23.960]  they did one of these, they paid for one of these, we know all about it.
[51:24.360 --> 51:27.320]  And for some reason they're lying about it. Um,
[51:27.360 --> 51:29.480]  that's going to play out really interestingly in court.
[51:29.520 --> 51:33.920]  Do we have access to the truth on those surveys? Uh, we,
[51:34.080 --> 51:36.800]  we don't know what the results they got back,
[51:36.800 --> 51:40.880]  but we know they bragged about them enough to the local hospitals for the local
[51:40.920 --> 51:45.320]  hospitals to put literature together that involved or that referenced this,
[51:45.360 --> 51:49.520]  the polling done. We know who did the poll. We know who paid for the poll.
[51:50.840 --> 51:54.080]  Um, we know who probably got handed the check that paid for the poll.
[51:54.080 --> 51:56.640]  We know who probably cashed it. Uh,
[51:57.720 --> 51:59.640]  it's disturbing that they're lying about it.
[51:59.640 --> 52:02.360]  All they had to do was put it on their campaign finance report and nobody gives
[52:02.360 --> 52:05.000]  you shit. Um, but they didn't.
[52:05.320 --> 52:07.120]  And then they keep claiming to the press that they didn't.
[52:07.720 --> 52:10.800]  And eventually the judge is going to want to know why.
[52:11.360 --> 52:13.800]  And that's an issue that could keep them off the ballot too.
[52:13.800 --> 52:15.080]  Same thing with the money in the jars.
[52:15.080 --> 52:18.480]  That's a big enough screw up to keep you off the ballot. Um,
[52:18.480 --> 52:23.120]  if you want to make law, you've got to follow law. Um, it's really that simple.
[52:23.680 --> 52:27.040]  Did they hire a lawyer? They did. It's their main volunteer.
[52:27.040 --> 52:31.800]  He's donated like 10 or $12,000 worth of lawyer hours to their effort.
[52:32.120 --> 52:35.240]  It's like six hours. Uh, I have no idea what he charges,
[52:35.240 --> 52:39.520]  but that's on their campaign finance reports. Wow. Okay. Um,
[52:39.600 --> 52:43.800]  I've spent a disturbing amount of time going through those reports. Um,
[52:44.200 --> 52:45.920]  it's fun to work on campaigns.
[52:46.680 --> 52:49.200]  I'm sure the look on your face when you talk about it's great.
[52:49.240 --> 52:52.520]  It's it's fun. It's, I mean, it's very,
[52:52.880 --> 52:56.600]  very well could be the death of Pueblo. Like, yeah,
[52:56.880 --> 53:01.040]  we really can't handle the loss. This would be to our community.
[53:01.360 --> 53:05.600]  We were on the edge for a while. Parts of town are still very,
[53:05.600 --> 53:08.960]  very bad. Um, crime is a huge problem.
[53:09.000 --> 53:10.920]  Infrastructure spending is a huge problem.
[53:11.400 --> 53:16.000]  If we lose 60% of our construction industry, 1300 marijuana jobs,
[53:16.440 --> 53:19.840]  all of the expansion that industry is supposed to go through over the next
[53:19.840 --> 53:24.360]  several years. Um, all of that real estate floods back onto the market.
[53:24.920 --> 53:27.280]  Like that's a death blow.
[53:27.720 --> 53:32.720]  All those people that moved here because somebody like myself had a job and was
[53:33.160 --> 53:33.880]  like, I need a helper.
[53:33.880 --> 53:36.760]  And I got somebody that I know in another state that I trust brought them out
[53:36.760 --> 53:39.720]  here. Those people and myself would be fucked. You'd be fucked.
[53:40.080 --> 53:41.120]  Well, there's a huge number.
[53:41.160 --> 53:45.040]  How many people were five people that moved here within the last year? Yeah.
[53:45.600 --> 53:49.320]  How many people are employed by the spot? Like 30, 35. Yeah.
[53:49.360 --> 53:53.080]  That's one dispensary. How many of them are there in Pueblo West?
[53:53.640 --> 53:57.040]  Um, a hundred licenses.
[53:57.160 --> 54:00.880]  It's 1300 people. Um, it's, it literally,
[54:00.880 --> 54:03.280]  if this vote passes 1300 people are out of work.
[54:03.680 --> 54:07.080]  It's a full 1% of our population down here. Um,
[54:07.080 --> 54:11.560]  you add that immediately to the unemployment rules and then you compound that
[54:11.560 --> 54:14.480]  with all of, it's not like I got fired for stealing.
[54:15.200 --> 54:18.880]  It's 1300 people got put out of a work cause an industry closed. We,
[54:18.880 --> 54:22.600]  I know one gets to apply for the job. I just lost. Um,
[54:22.640 --> 54:26.440]  all of us are now applying for whatever jobs were currently available when our
[54:26.440 --> 54:27.360]  industry shut down.
[54:27.400 --> 54:31.200]  What percentage of those people go home and buy a bunch of fucking lights with
[54:31.200 --> 54:33.360]  their first unemployment check and build a black market,
[54:33.360 --> 54:35.160]  grow and start flipping black market weed?
[54:35.280 --> 54:38.520]  Well, that's, I mean, I figure half of what we do,
[54:38.520 --> 54:40.760]  about 20 million in annual sales down here.
[54:41.040 --> 54:44.600]  I figure half of that immediately goes back into the black market.
[54:44.600 --> 54:47.880]  And the other half goes either up the highway to Colorado Springs or down the
[54:47.880 --> 54:53.200]  highway to Trinidad. Um, I, the tourist money goes to Trinidad and Manitou.
[54:53.480 --> 54:55.640]  The medical money goes to Colorado Springs.
[54:55.680 --> 54:59.560]  Everybody doesn't feel like that's a effort worth putting in for a bag of weed.
[55:00.040 --> 55:01.320]  Just goes back to the black market.
[55:01.400 --> 55:03.760]  Yeah. Just put some seeds in the dirt in the basement.
[55:03.760 --> 55:05.360]  Immediately shine some lights on that bitch.
[55:06.000 --> 55:08.480]  We lose out on 5 million in tax revenue next year.
[55:09.040 --> 55:12.280]  Like that's paying for all kinds of cool shit that wasn't getting paid for
[55:12.280 --> 55:13.640]  before because we didn't have the money.
[55:13.680 --> 55:16.560]  The city's starting to look decent. It's clean. It's getting cleaned up.
[55:16.560 --> 55:17.800]  The potholes are going away.
[55:17.840 --> 55:21.000]  It's starting to little by little steps getting more man.
[55:21.000 --> 55:24.080]  I noticed that the last street I drive on on my way to your place,
[55:24.080 --> 55:25.880]  it's really just got repaid.
[55:25.880 --> 55:26.680]  Yeah. They just repaid.
[55:26.680 --> 55:30.000]  And that thing's been jacked since I've known about Pueblo.
[55:31.480 --> 55:35.120]  Um, that whole Boulevard has been rocked pot for potholes. It's working.
[55:35.400 --> 55:39.280]  It really does work. It's just little by little. It takes a minute.
[55:39.280 --> 55:42.000]  People are like, why has, why aren't our schools perfect?
[55:42.040 --> 55:45.600]  We've had legal weed for two years. Why aren't all our streets perfect?
[55:45.600 --> 55:47.280]  It's been two years. It just takes a minute.
[55:47.280 --> 55:50.920]  Do you have any info on the scholarship that was awarded to the child?
[55:51.840 --> 55:56.240]  Doubled it. Boom. Um, uh, like if I was king of the world,
[55:56.240 --> 56:01.320]  the scholarship would be bigger and spendable in more places. Um,
[56:01.360 --> 56:02.720]  but it's still really awesome.
[56:02.800 --> 56:06.320]  We're sending 25 kids to college that probably wouldn't have been able to go
[56:06.320 --> 56:07.360]  without that two grand.
[56:07.360 --> 56:10.080]  Explain a little bit how that happened to people that haven't kept up at all.
[56:10.160 --> 56:14.360]  The local County commissioners, we, we pass the voters,
[56:14.360 --> 56:16.200]  we pass the local excise tax.
[56:16.200 --> 56:19.760]  So all of the production when you grow marijuana and then sell it to a retail
[56:19.760 --> 56:23.200]  store, it gets taxed at that point. Um,
[56:23.200 --> 56:27.600]  and that money goes into kind of a slash fund for dream projects we couldn't pay
[56:27.600 --> 56:29.800]  for before. Um, we pay,
[56:29.960 --> 56:33.320]  when I grow the flowers, when I grow the flowers at greener, healthy wellness,
[56:33.720 --> 56:38.120]  I have to, they have to be packaged and then transferred to the store.
[56:38.800 --> 56:40.960]  That's where the tax happens. Okay.
[56:41.040 --> 56:44.040]  If it was in Pueblo County, that's where the tax would have. Okay. All right.
[56:44.360 --> 56:48.520]  Um, when Colorado Springs passes an excise tax, um, on medical,
[56:48.560 --> 56:52.600]  then it'll happen there. Okay. Um, but we already did that down here for rec.
[56:53.080 --> 56:57.440]  And so that's going to be, this is the first year that tax has been in effect.
[56:57.960 --> 57:00.160]  Um, so money's just starting to trickle in,
[57:00.160 --> 57:03.920]  but we expect three and a half million dollars from that excise tax this year.
[57:04.440 --> 57:08.200]  And that's the bulk of the marijuana taxes that Pueblo County is going to make
[57:08.200 --> 57:12.520]  next year. Um, we get 3.5 from the excise tax ish.
[57:12.880 --> 57:16.920]  It's an estimate so far. We'll see what, how it actually plans out. Um,
[57:16.920 --> 57:21.680]  and then we're definitely going to get 1.7 to 1.8 in licensing fees and sales
[57:21.680 --> 57:24.080]  tax. Um, yeah.
[57:24.680 --> 57:26.040]  If the industry exists.
[57:26.280 --> 57:29.120]  If the will know that's, that's through the end of this year.
[57:29.120 --> 57:32.240]  So even if the election goes against this in November,
[57:32.440 --> 57:35.760]  we still get to operate until next November. Um,
[57:35.800 --> 57:40.400]  it was sort of your licenses can expire as it comes,
[57:40.720 --> 57:44.840]  comes up for expiration until November, 2017.
[57:45.240 --> 57:47.120]  So, um,
[57:47.160 --> 57:51.680]  the shop that gets their license in like November the first,
[57:52.760 --> 57:55.000]  um, of this year is in,
[57:55.000 --> 57:57.680]  is in the best shape to operate as long as possible,
[57:57.680 --> 58:02.720]  regardless of the election outcome. Um, hopefully that made sense. Yeah.
[58:02.840 --> 58:06.800]  But, uh, it's just a death blow to us. It's,
[58:06.800 --> 58:08.600]  we're doing so much with,
[58:08.760 --> 58:12.360]  it's not a lot compared to our whole County budget.
[58:12.760 --> 58:17.800]  But the, the problem with our County budget is that it passed its breaking point
[58:17.840 --> 58:19.320]  a couple million dollars ago.
[58:19.920 --> 58:23.920]  And we just have to look at middle school kids walking in the middle of the
[58:23.920 --> 58:28.280]  street with the buses and the car traffic and go, sorry, no money for sidewalks.
[58:28.520 --> 58:32.920]  Or crossing guards or crossing guards. Um, yeah.
[58:32.960 --> 58:34.200]  Like all kinds of stuff. There's,
[58:34.320 --> 58:38.680]  we took asbestos out of a couple of schools and I read that in the newspaper and
[58:38.680 --> 58:43.120]  I was like, asbestos in schools, it's fucking 2016. Oh, it's hurting my face. Ow.
[58:44.560 --> 58:46.000]  And I just had to think about it. No,
[58:46.000 --> 58:50.480]  that was way down in San Juan County cause that's how we're spending that. Um,
[58:50.520 --> 58:55.120]  the state also collects an excise tax in the first 40 million from that fund goes
[58:55.120 --> 59:00.160]  to school construction through our state's best program and the best
[59:00.160 --> 59:02.200]  program. Literally when you apply for it,
[59:02.200 --> 59:04.560]  you explain how your school districts broke,
[59:04.880 --> 59:08.680]  how they've never had money since the forties and how you badly need to do
[59:08.680 --> 59:10.880]  stuff that should have been done 30 years ago,
[59:10.880 --> 59:15.320]  but you've never found a way to pay for. And so they're doing stuff like, um,
[59:15.360 --> 59:19.760]  taking the lead out of the pipes, taking the asbestos out of the gym, um,
[59:20.680 --> 59:25.640]  putting pads in the playground. Yeah. Like, or building a playground period, um,
[59:25.880 --> 59:28.280]  paving the road to it. Um,
[59:28.320 --> 59:32.200]  all kinds of crazy stuff that we really should have done decades ago,
[59:32.560 --> 59:35.800]  but just never had the money and we were never going to have it.
[59:36.240 --> 59:40.760]  And the now we can fund it with weed money because it's just enough more than
[59:40.760 --> 59:43.720]  what we need to do. Everything else that wasn't getting funded.
[59:44.240 --> 59:46.040]  So loop us back around to the scholarships.
[59:46.240 --> 59:48.520]  So sorry, the scholarships, they gave, uh,
[59:48.560 --> 59:52.960]  each kid that wanted up to 400 kids, a thousand bucks. Um,
[59:53.000 --> 59:56.720]  400 kids got a thousand bucks. Well, that was the offer. Um,
[59:56.720 --> 59:59.960]  only 25 ended up applying. Okay. Um,
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.840]  part of the reason for that is you have to be a Pueblo high school graduate and
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:08.640]  we had way more than 25 of those dicks. And we're thinking that, um,
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:14.560]  but, uh, you had to go to college in Pueblo County. And so, yeah,
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:17.800]  if I was king of the world, it'd be at least anywhere in Colorado. Right.
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:19.360]  Cause Nebraska don't need my fucking money.
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:21.040]  They just want to keep the money in the county. Um, yeah.
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:22.360]  They just wanted to keep it in the county.
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:25.400]  They wanted to promote the local university. Um,
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:28.240]  and there's a lot of cool things happening down here at our local university.
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:30.400]  So why not keep it on the all local, but
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:34.120]  good music program, a good mass program, but I don't know about other stuff.
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.480]  The governor liked the program so much. He,
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:39.960]  he used state marijuana taxes to double it to two grand.
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:43.120]  And I mean, honestly, that's books for a whole year.
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:47.160]  That's meals for most of the whole year for half a year.
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:51.680]  It depends on how you will know. I was a college student.
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:54.280]  So some of these numbers aren't real unrealistic. Um,
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:58.160]  that might just be a decade old. Sorry. But, uh, I mean,
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:00:59.800]  $2,000 down here in Pueblo,
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:03.280]  that's fully the difference between I'm able to go and I'm not able to go.
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:07.360]  And honestly, if $2,000 is going to really make or break that difference,
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:11.040]  like college in New York or wherever else,
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:14.880]  I'd be happy to send you with that two grand probably wasn't a make or break
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:15.760]  anyway. Right.
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:20.000]  Like it requires a lot more to live out of state than it does in your hometown.
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:23.600]  Yeah. You could still stay with the fam. Oh, for sure.
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:28.520]  Like that takes out a huge amount of huge, huge amount. Yeah. Um, but, uh,
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:32.160]  it's a fantastic program and the anti-pop people are all over it.
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:34.280]  They're like, this is just propaganda. And it's like, Oh,
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:36.800]  it's making sure that more kids get to go to college.
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:40.880]  Propaganda when that kid goes to college, how's that propaganda?
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:41.920]  Like some real shit.
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:45.600]  One of the things people won't refuse to accept is that marijuana was always
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:49.520]  here in a way that's so much larger than anyone really wants to admit.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.560]  I mean, it's 60 billion coast to coast. Um,
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:59.080]  six 0 billion. I mean, that's a, a huge amount of money.
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:01.560]  I don't think anybody can fathom that much cash.
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:06.040]  It's I mean, yeah. In $20 bills, it's a couple of high schools full,
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:10.320]  probably. I don't know, but it's an insane amount of money.
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:14.280]  Just stuffed with hundreds. It's all just under the surface.
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:17.640]  It's your neighbor's house. It's the park your kids play at.
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:20.640]  It's the school your kids go to. It's even the fucking prisons.
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:24.120]  Like prohibition doesn't work at all. It's right under our noses.
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:27.160]  It's always has been, it always will be. Um,
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:29.160]  it's just mostly invisible.
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:32.840]  The only people who are able to be visible with it are the people with nothing
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.760]  to lose. Um,
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:38.280]  and no one's willing to admit that in Colorado anymore.
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:42.120]  Everybody's like it's new, especially the anti-pop people. And, uh,
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:46.800]  all we did was shift where people buy it and we're able to do so many cool things
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:49.680]  with that money. Yeah. And because it's a legit industry now,
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:53.120]  we can make turps because now we got science. We don't have to be afraid to go.
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:56.680]  If you get caught buying the equipment that it takes to make these turps at the
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:59.360]  store, they'd turn you in for making a fucking meth lab back in the day.
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:00.400]  And then it can be like, no,
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:03.840]  we're with this dispensary and we need all this equipment to make hash. Yup.
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:08.000]  And now you can do that. It's, we can more effectively treat patients.
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:11.240]  Everyone forgets about the patients. We're all about getting turped out now.
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:16.160]  I used to spend the first 20 minutes with a new big fat bag of weed
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:20.640]  looking for mold, looking for mildew, looking for washers,
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:25.240]  spider eggs, um, all kinds of nasty funks. Yeah.
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.360]  I've gotten toenails in a week before.
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:31.320]  Sit there breaking out bud and have a bug crawl out of the nugget up your arm.
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:36.800]  Like it was that shit we used to put up with and the fact that it's all gone now
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:42.960]  like there, this, the benefits stream just, it's endless.
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:47.120]  It's so far past the money, but for a place like Pueblo, the money's vital.
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:50.880]  Does South of us in town, even smaller, the sheriff was in the paper.
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:54.120]  Like I wasn't sure what to think at first. Now I love it.
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:56.400]  Look what it's done to the downtown area. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:59.520]  They've built a river walk down there because of cannabis money. Yep.
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:02.120]  They're Trinidad's not going to die now. Yeah.
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:06.480]  We had steel here and steel isn't as big as it used to be.
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:09.680]  People want to go lightweight now. So it's titanium and we don't have a titanium.
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:14.680]  We have a steel mill and so people were leaving and people don't want to work at
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:17.040]  a steel mill forever. Now it's kind of the technology era.
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.640]  People are getting the fuck out of here. It's not, was going bad.
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:22.600]  I've lived here for a long time. Uh, Mike and I have been here.
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:26.440]  We were here before all the cannabis shit happened and I have seen this town.
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:29.080]  It was kind of a little, a little cow town when I moved here.
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:33.240]  It was flourishing. Like it's actually going somewhere now. I'm kind of proud.
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:38.560]  We're finally crawling out of the funk we were in for like 40 years. Um,
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:39.640]  the flood fucked us up.
[01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:47.400]  I mean honestly it was when the steel mill started to slow down. Um,
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:52.640]  a whole huge generation of people didn't have an easy way to feed their families
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:56.080]  down here. It wasn't easy to find work anymore. Um,
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:58.120]  you really had to work at it. When I moved here,
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:01.600]  you had to know somebody that was hiring. Yeah. Period.
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:03.280]  If that's how this town is,
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:06.200]  this is one of those towns where you could fill out a thousand applications and
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:08.360]  unless you know somebody here, you're not going to get a job.
[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:12.360]  Most of the job and housing listings never make it online here.
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:16.720]  It's you drive up and down the streets you want to live on and look for someone
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:20.440]  putting out a for rent sign and walk up and talk to that person before it sits
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:23.400]  out there too long. Um, it's the same thing with jobs.
[01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:25.160]  You heard a friend of yours got fired,
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:29.200]  wander into wherever they used to work and talk to the manager stat. Um,
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:32.160]  cause otherwise there ain't no job for you in the city. Um,
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:36.560]  and that's slowly changing now. We have hiring or staffing agencies now that,
[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:40.320]  that help people get a foothold in the marijuana industry. Um,
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:44.880]  we have an industry down here that's going to need a hundred more trimmers next
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:47.120]  year. Shout out to Linus. Um,
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:52.360]  the real downside is that we're not publicizing in all 50 States when it takes
[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:53.360]  the work in this industry.
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:59.320]  People think that they can show up late and take a shit and be 20 minutes late
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:05:59.920]  and hang out.
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:04.080]  I talk to people every day that are shocked to learn. It's like a real business.
[01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:04.600]  Yeah.
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:07.600]  They think you could just hang out and smoke joints all day and fuck off.
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:12.040]  And like they thought their high school weed dealer had a store now where he just
[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:16.400]  kind of like hung out and played Xbox and then waited at his table and then you
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:17.760]  gave him money and it was weird.
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:21.760]  And then they'd leave and they walk in and they see what looks basically like an
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:25.160]  Apple store or a purse or shoe store in the mall.
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:28.320]  That you just give me a chance to tease something that we're going to talk about
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:30.960]  on a future episode. I want to wait until you and Lindsay are here.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:34.520]  We're going to talk about the weirdest shit that people have ever done in a
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:35.360]  dispensary.
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:39.320]  I was asked to do that episode today by someone at work who listened to the
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:40.560]  dispensary etiquette episode.
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:44.440]  Oh, nice. Nice. We're going to talk about that when lens is available.
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:47.880]  Lens just got back from a little vacation and she took the night off.
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:51.880]  She was invited, but she needed a nappy poo. So she's cuddled up with Scooby.
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:56.120]  So Scooby the dog, what up Scoob? What's up Scoobs? Good boy.
[01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:58.360]  Shout to that air conditioner over there.
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:01.960]  But, uh, we're going to get lens on and we're going to talk about some weird shit
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:04.760]  that's happened in dispensaries. I've got a pretty good story myself.
[01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:07.280]  Dispensaries are awesome. It's,
[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:11.240]  it's a really magical place where banana ramek shit happens on the regular.
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:15.560]  Still, but I remember when we had a store way back in the wild fucking West days,
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:18.320]  some of the crazy shit that would happen. Let's see. We got to save those stories.
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:20.840]  I'm so excited. I got a cheesy ass grin on my face.
[01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:24.840]  Cause we ran the place before you like, you could get a weave card.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.640]  Really good. My leg hurts. I need weed card.
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:29.800]  And they'd say how much money you got.
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:32.000]  And you'd tell them they'd write you that many plants. Like, here you go.
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:34.440]  Have a great fucking day. They didn't even care back then.
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:36.120]  Like weed card for sale.
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:39.120]  Well that was the, in the very first days,
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:44.120]  like even the doctors were at the fringe of society because the DEA was still
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:49.040]  threatening that if a doctor wrote a recommendation for marijuana in Colorado,
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:52.680]  that they could lose their DEA license to write prescriptions for anything,
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:54.840]  any other drug. Um,
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:59.880]  and so the doctors that were like the first five doctors in Colorado to sign
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:03.480]  paperwork period were the kind of doctors where like,
[01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:06.800]  if you were there because you fell on something and it went through like your
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:09.800]  forearm or your leg, you'd start talking to them.
[01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:13.960]  And after 15 or minutes or so you'd be like, you know what, don't doc,
[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:17.320]  I'm just gonna the next doc up the road. Sorry.
[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:20.560]  Like I don't care that I've been paled through something that's not going to
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.720]  kill me immediately. Yeah. Um,
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:26.680]  but that changed six months later when they stopped hounding doctors.
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:31.080]  Remember that weird ass doc that used to come to a ponytail? Yeah.
[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:33.000]  With the ponytail. No, that was the husband.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.440]  The husband had a ponytail and a cane.
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:37.240]  The doctor was the woman who wouldn't look you in the eye. Oh no,
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:40.760]  I'm talking about the crazy guy and the crazy wife. They used to come together.
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:42.720]  Yeah. Okay. Is that okay? Yeah. Well let's see.
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:43.920]  I was working at a dispensary.
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:47.120]  The lady that owned that dispensary used to bake edibles and she would show up
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:49.560]  with trays of edibles and she'd be like, Mike and Jeff,
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:53.040]  you have to try to make some of those days. It was brownies, this carrot cake,
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:56.200]  this fucking banana bread, this cookie, nine products I make,
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:57.840]  here's your nine samples.
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:01.760]  And then you restock the shelves with the rest and then five minutes later she'd
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:06.160]  go, which one did you eat? And you'd go, it's 11am and I was at work.
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:11.040]  And she would go, well, which one are you going to eat right now in front of me?
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:12.120]  Yeah. She didn't give a fuck.
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:16.360]  She'd stare at you and then look at the pile of options you had really curious
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:20.000]  as to what you might pick. Totally oblivious that you took this a little more
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.520]  seriously than she did or you're not interested in finding out how strong she
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:29.200]  made them this week at 11am and 15 minutes after you ate the first one,
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:31.320]  she'd ask you what the next one was going to be. Yeah.
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:34.360]  And there are some days where I don't know how we made it through clothes.
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:37.000]  There were some times that the numbers were a little bit off.
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:41.120]  There were some days I wasn't sure people were keeping numbers. Yeah.
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:43.880]  So I'm pretty sure there were some eight gram quarters going out the door
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:48.560]  like there was a window that we had to stay with in between and we just kind of
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:51.120]  kept it from going too far outside of that little box.
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:54.240]  Shout out to Karen and her homemade edibles that you were sucking rice.
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:57.200]  So about that banana bread, Josh and I fell down the stairs,
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:59.520]  like fucking rolled down the dance.
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:05.440]  And they would tumble down it. Like laughing like ladies.
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:09.040]  I remember walking up three flights of stairs and ridiculous heat.
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:10.560]  Cause it got really hot in that building.
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:14.280]  And I'd get to the third floor knowing that that was where I needed to go and
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:15.440]  have no idea why I was there.
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:20.360]  And I'd get halfway back downstairs before I remembered whatever it was I went
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:23.280]  up for. That place was fun. Speaking of edibles, uh,
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:28.120]  I'm pretty sure I mentioned eating a 1000 milligram. Gosh, excuse me for that.
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:31.520]  A 1000 milligram folks. Guys, I don't recommend it.
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:34.520]  Don't eat a thousand milligram edible unless you want to be fucked up for a day
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:38.080]  and a half. If you're not me, probably three days. I think like a civilian,
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:40.080]  if you gave that to like, right.
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:43.920]  But I'm not anybody else that we know that doesn't smoke up an article at home
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:46.440]  entitled. I drank the weed lube. Um,
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:50.440]  three days. Um,
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:54.680]  the a hundred milligram edible if people get novices gobbled up sucker up six,
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:58.880]  eight hours is what people report is just, you ate the a hundred milligram.
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:00.480]  Jeff's talking about a 1000.
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:03.760]  Yeah. I had a thousand milligram edible. Honest. I haven't been,
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:06.000]  I've been gun shy, bro. I haven't eaten an edible since then.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.360]  I've been a little bit. I did it to myself the other day.
[01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:13.360]  It wasn't even with a really big dose. I just, I popped a couple.
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:15.720]  I thought I'd be comfortable with it. We got to the movie theater.
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:17.640]  I looked up and was just blown the fuck away.
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:21.920]  There were so many food choices and before I could figure out what I wanted,
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:25.040]  I heard my wife giggling next to me. Like she's not a smoker,
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:29.640]  but she knows when I look up and I'm just too big to pick from the menu. Um,
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:32.440]  and I didn't mean to do it. It was an accident. Um,
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:34.920]  so it happens to the pros too, but yeah,
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:40.120]  that thousand milligrams was rough on my system. It, it, it fucked me up.
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:42.240]  My whole body felt weird for a day and a half.
[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:45.440]  People assume that that's like the comfortable intro to,
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:49.640]  to marijuana consumption. And it's not like smoking's the, the time tested.
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:51.520]  Yeah. Smoke some flowers through a pipe,
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:54.360]  smoke some flowers through a bong or a joint. Get used to that.
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:55.560]  Take a dab one day,
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:59.960]  take like three dabs in one day and then start taking big dabs and then dab
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:03.680]  every day and then eat some edibles. Progress slow. It gets expensive.
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:08.560]  Well, yeah. Rig junkie. I like a good rig.
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:11.000]  I did as long as you can do, you can,
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:14.480]  you can look people in the eye and say, I don't eject what I'm addicted to.
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:19.200]  I just buy glass. It's not the same different kind of glass.
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:23.880]  Just rig after rig after rig. It's such a beautiful thing.
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:28.320]  Shout out to my friends at elevate glass. 517 South Dayhoen. If you need a rig,
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:30.360]  you really need to legalize it in your area.
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:34.560]  The benefits enough. Make your table look like mine. Just glass rigs everywhere.
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:37.320]  You just want, you want to hear this kind of shit. Oil slick.
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:41.880]  Just want to hear glass rigs all over the place. Oil slick. It's a shout out.
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:46.800]  Hey, it's 85% of this table cover. Mike's given shot. It's time to wrap up the show.
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:49.680]  Yes. The table is covered in oil. Careful. That's to give away something again.
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:55.680]  We can't do that. Who wants this old shoe? That's really ironic.
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:58.760]  There's another story that matches up with what you just said that, uh,
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:01.280]  I stepped in dog shit today. Fire shit off.
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:03.880]  The first time in a really long time that I've stepped in dog shit and I've
[01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:07.720]  done stepped in some shit today. Uh, all right, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:10.720]  thanks for listening to the podcast. Uh, Mike, thanks for coming and hanging out.
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:12.800]  Mike's wife. Thanks for letting Mike come and hang out.
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:16.320]  He did an hour and 15 minutes. The phone has beeped a couple of times.
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:18.040]  You can reach over and check it out and see who it is.
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:20.960]  Now I'll turn off your mic and I'll talk for a couple of seconds here by myself.
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:22.840]  Have a good night people. Hope you enjoyed the show.
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:24.960]  Make sure you guys check out Mike's Facebook group.
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:28.680]  Make sure you follow Mike on a two winder. I almost said Tinder.
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:31.480]  Make sure you follow him on Twitter. No, don't do it on Tinder.
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:33.760]  You'll get them in trouble. Mike's a married man with the new baby.
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:37.080]  He is not on Tinder. Don't do that. Good luck on Tinder.

[01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.800]  It's always fun to hear what the people want to think.
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:02.520]  I would love it if you'd support me on social media. Mike's laughing.
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:06.080]  I'm gonna turn him down, bro. You get to be everywhere, bro. You get to be a,
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:08.080]  dude, I was laughing over there.

[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:16.320]  The program shit starts making it hard. Did we get too sober? That could be it.
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:19.400]  That could be it. And I took a fat dab. Go to go follow me. You guys go follow me
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:22.400]  on all the social media. Go to a T why do I want to say Tinder?

[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:52.640]  The other day I posted a picture of a butterfly just to get a little bit,
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:54.360]  a little bit of variety on my page,
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:57.480]  but I usually post a whole bunch of good cannabis photography, uh,
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:00.520]  big bud shots, big room shots, trichome shots.

[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:27.600]  Well, had to go with words.
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:31.720]  There needed to be descriptive words in there quickly off the top of my head.
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:32.560]  And those are the ones that I had.
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:34.920]  Demo guys. It's been a minute. We need something to pick apart.
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:38.320]  That's the truth. We'll play with your toys. God damn it. This got dirty quickly.
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:40.680]  I can email me. It's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:42.720]  I'd love to hear from you. Love to check out your products.
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:44.400]  I think that's all I've got for you this week.
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:47.400]  Shout out to dead and co.
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:49.400]  Shout out to my friend that took me to dead and co.
[01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:51.400]  Shout out to the friend that got us the tickets.
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:53.400]  Nice hookup.
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:54.400]  Big shout out to my ninja Spence.
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:58.400]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:15:59.400]  Check it out.
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:32.960]  I'm going to acknowledge and acknowledge that I hated that route.
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:34.960]  So I backed out and I doubt I'll ever make it back.
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:37.960]  I see the way you act. Cut the jealous crap.
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:39.960]  Something's fishy here. I think I smell a rat.
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:42.960]  This is our house, but we ain't got to tell them that.
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:45.960]  Let's leave them at the front door yelling at the welcome mat.
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:47.960]  Come on, everybody. Get another dab pat.
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:50.960]  Same routine, slightly different from the last track.
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:53.960]  A million songs about me, but where the dabs at?
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:55.960]  You don't like my dabbing songs? You can kiss my ass crack.
[01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:58.960]  Come on, everybody. Drop another huge bomb.
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:00.960]  420 came, 710, it's time to move on.
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:03.960]  Upgrade your tolerance, downsize your new bomb.
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:06.960]  Favorite way to medicate, I don't think it's too strong.
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:08.960]  All my fans, I'ma make them bounce.
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:11.960]  Like my checks from my bank account when I write in fake amounts.
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.960]  I love the paper stacks, but I hate the count.
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:16.960]  Lumberjack, run a half to an eighth an ounce.
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:19.960]  Some would say that I'm stuck on a bad earth.
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:22.960]  I would say those people suck like a back perch.
[01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:27.960]  The hash surgeon, working the dish, then teaching the plants to man so he learns how to fish.
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:30.960]  Oil up the butter pan, Linus is the brother man.
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:33.960]  Number one producer, so I don't need another fan.
[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:35.960]  But y'all don't understand anyway.
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:38.960]  Yap about money while we rubber band every day.
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:44.960]  And when I say hit the trees, I mean up by the honey hive, chillin' with the bees.
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:48.960]  Fuck sticks and seeds, I want all different breeds and consistencies.
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:51.960]  Come on, everybody. Get another dab pat.
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:54.960]  Same routine, slightly different from the last track.
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:56.960]  A million songs about me, but where the dabs at?
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:59.960]  You don't like my dabbing songs? You can kiss my ass crack.
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:01.960]  Come on, everybody. Drop another huge bomb.
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:04.960]  Core 20 came, 710, it's time to move on.
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:06.960]  Upgrade your tolerance, downsize your new bomb.
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:09.960]  Favorite way to medicate, I don't think it's too strong.
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:27.960]  I'm out.
