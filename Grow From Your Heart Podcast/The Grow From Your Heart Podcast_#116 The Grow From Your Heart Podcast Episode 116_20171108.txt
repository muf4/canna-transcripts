[00:18.940 --> 00:23.100]  Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis Community. It's time for episode number 116 of the
[00:23.100 --> 00:26.940]  Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and
[00:26.940 --> 00:30.740]  conversation. That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional
[00:30.740 --> 00:33.580]  grower, if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a cannabis
[00:33.580 --> 00:36.220]  activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of
[00:36.220 --> 00:41.540]  cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you. I'm your host, my friends, call
[00:41.540 --> 00:44.580]  me Rasta Jeff. I want to thank you guys for joining me. Like always, I hope you got a
[00:44.580 --> 00:47.940]  fat blunt, hope you got a dab, hope you got the vaporizer going, hope you got
[00:47.940 --> 00:51.500]  something going into your head right now, putting some THC and or some CBD
[00:51.500 --> 00:55.020]  into your body. Hope you're getting blazed as shit. Everybody at this table
[00:55.020 --> 00:58.220]  is red-eyed, got a good smile on their face. I've got a nice group of people
[00:58.220 --> 01:01.100]  over here today. Sitting to my left is my new friend Danny. I want to welcome you to
[01:01.100 --> 01:04.260]  the show. How you doing, buddy? Talk into the microphone for me, please. I'm gonna
[01:04.260 --> 01:06.700]  have to remind everyone to talk into a microphone. Everyone's all red-eyed and
[01:06.700 --> 01:10.940]  dabbed out. It's been a long fucking day, man. It has been a long day. Did you go to Boulder last night or today?
[01:10.940 --> 01:15.700]  We went last night. We went to Boulder and Denver yesterday. Nice, nice. Are you new to Colorado?
[01:15.700 --> 01:20.180]  Yeah, just flew in from New York on Saturday. New York. Are you staying or are you just visiting?
[01:20.180 --> 01:26.100]  Just visiting right now, trying to make some moves out here. Trying to make some moves.
[01:26.100 --> 01:29.220]  Well, it'd be cool to have you. I like your company, bro. You're a cool dude. So, hope you make it out here.
[01:29.220 --> 01:34.140]  Good luck. Thanks, dude. Likewise. Right on. Sitting to his left, did you notice how I had to
[01:34.140 --> 01:37.460]  fucking see which direction that was? Oh my gosh, this is gonna be a fun show.
[01:37.460 --> 01:41.660]  Sitting to his left is a repeat offender, a return guest, our good friend Joe Buzzy.
[01:41.660 --> 01:44.980]  Welcome back, brother. How you doing? Yo, what's happening? Thanks for coming, man.
[01:45.300 --> 01:49.300]  Yeah, no problem. Glad you showed up. Joe showed up and rolled a couple of joints, lit them up,
[01:49.300 --> 01:54.580]  tasty stuff. What are we smoking in that joint right there? This one right here is a mystery
[01:54.580 --> 02:00.980]  kush plant. It is some unknown bag seed that was grown and kind of smells lemony, kushy.
[02:01.940 --> 02:05.620]  Mystery lemon kush? Mystery kush, yeah. Sounds good to me. Let's smoke that shit whenever you're ready.
[02:05.620 --> 02:10.500]  Thanks for coming again, bro. No problem. Awesome. Sitting to his left, sort of to my left-ish a
[02:10.500 --> 02:14.820]  little bit still, is my new friend. Diagonal, yeah. Yeah, diagonal left. Caesar, right? Yeah, Caesar.
[02:14.820 --> 02:17.540]  Awesome, man. Talk into the microphone a little bit more for me. There you go, right up there,
[02:17.540 --> 02:23.860]  news reporter style. Looks good on you. I think I could do it, right? So, you took a dab earlier and
[02:23.860 --> 02:27.860]  you said it was gonna wreck you. Are you not a heavy dabber? No, no, no, I really don't. I just
[02:27.860 --> 02:32.100]  kind of smoke a lot of flour. Well, thanks for... Are you from New York also? Yeah. You got that
[02:32.100 --> 02:35.940]  New York accent coming with you? Can't escape it. Yeah, it doesn't go away. It's great for the
[02:35.940 --> 02:39.700]  listeners. They get tired of hearing this Colorado plain voice, so they'll enjoy something new.
[02:40.500 --> 02:43.620]  So, are you staying or are you just coming to visit? No, no, just coming to visit. I mean,
[02:43.620 --> 02:48.020]  on vacation, good times with better people, you know? Nice, better people. More relaxed vibe here
[02:48.020 --> 02:52.100]  than on the coast? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm sure of that. I've been out there. I spend usually 12 hours a day,
[02:52.100 --> 02:57.940]  six days a week in Manhattan, so... Holy shit. Gets exhausting. How much does weed cost in Manhattan?
[02:57.940 --> 03:04.180]  It's like 50 for an eighth, I mean... Is it any good? Hit or miss. Hit or miss. All right, yeah, that's
[03:04.180 --> 03:07.460]  what's got to suck about it. You're gonna spend that 50 and it's either gonna be, oh yeah,
[03:07.460 --> 03:12.980]  or it's gonna be, oh man. Yeah. So, you got delivery service where you are? No, I usually just
[03:12.980 --> 03:17.140]  go by my cousin's house and grab it. Make him do all the footwork. Nice. Shout out to your cousin.
[03:17.140 --> 03:23.220]  Don't say his name because he's a criminal. I don't want to end up in a ditch or a river for
[03:23.220 --> 03:28.740]  fucking saying your cousin's name on here. No, no, he revels in that shit. Well, man, thanks for coming
[03:28.740 --> 03:31.700]  on the show while you're out here visiting. Thanks for taking some visit time to come hang out.
[03:31.700 --> 03:36.580]  I appreciate it. Sitting to his right, which is directly in front of me. Oh, I remember I have
[03:36.580 --> 03:40.580]  two names in my head I want to call. I want to say Audrey, am I correct? No. Lindsay. Yes. Fuck yeah,
[03:40.580 --> 03:45.940]  I should have went with that. I doubted myself. I don't know why. So, Lindsay, thanks for coming.
[03:45.940 --> 03:50.020]  Yeah, absolutely. You live here now, right? Yeah, I do actually. I just moved out here with Chris
[03:50.020 --> 03:56.500]  when we came across. How many days ago? We've been here since like December 28th. Okay, so a couple
[03:56.500 --> 04:01.380]  three weeks-ish. Yeah, we were all over the place in Colorado just kind of seeing everything and
[04:01.380 --> 04:06.420]  then we kind of like settled down in Pueblo for a little bit. Nice. Yeah, you guys actually landed
[04:06.420 --> 04:10.900]  in our friend Sloppy's old house, right? Yes. That is awesome. Awesome. So they're sharing a microphone.
[04:10.900 --> 04:15.860]  You guys sitting to her. That's your left, but my right kind of is our friend Chris, who is actually
[04:15.860 --> 04:23.140]  also known as Bobo Blaster Co. Yes. Hello. Hello. How you doing, bro? It's me. Yeah, I do Bobo Blaster Co.
[04:23.140 --> 04:28.900]  If people don't know that, or Chris. Yeah, I do the email tables and stuff, stuff like that. Email
[04:28.900 --> 04:35.220]  tables, shelves, shelves, all types of stuff. Yeah. Cases, pelican cases. I have cases. Yeah, I have some weird
[04:35.220 --> 04:39.700]  other stuff too. I have like a little halo helmet set. It's coming out pretty soon too. I have a
[04:39.700 --> 04:45.220]  couple little ideas that are in the works. He's going to make me a small email for traveling
[04:45.220 --> 04:50.740]  purposes so that if I were to be in somebody's vehicle, maybe there could be some. I actually.
[04:50.740 --> 04:56.340]  I have one. We were just talking about that. I actually have a car version that I'm trying to do.
[04:56.340 --> 05:00.740]  That would be, you know, for camping, for when you're camping and you're parked and you want to
[05:00.740 --> 05:06.100]  take a dab in the car that is parked. Yes. Not driving. Not while you're driving. A vehicle. No, that would never
[05:06.100 --> 05:10.500]  happen to any of the professional people in this room. Awesome. So dude, thanks for.
[05:11.620 --> 05:15.620]  Right, right. So thanks for coming, man. Grab a mic if you're going to shout. It's cool. I'll just
[05:15.620 --> 05:18.500]  keep reminding you guys, these guys are new to podcasts. We didn't have enough mics for everybody,
[05:18.500 --> 05:22.340]  so they're sharing mics. We're doing it kind of radio station style or whatever, like a board
[05:22.420 --> 05:26.180]  show style, I think. But yeah, just grab a mic and slap the guy next to you. Steal his mic.
[05:34.180 --> 05:37.940]  It's gonna be a fun show. You guys, we took plenty of dabs before we got started.
[05:37.940 --> 05:42.500]  So I want to give you a big shout out, dude. Chris Bobo Blaster Co sent me the coolest dab
[05:42.500 --> 05:47.060]  table several months ago. I've been dabbing on it on a daily basis. I take.
[05:47.860 --> 05:51.780]  I'm going to say 10 dabs off that table. It definitely looks like it got work. I'm happy.
[05:53.220 --> 05:57.540]  It's been put to use. I'm happy to see that all my periscope friends have seen it. Anybody that's
[05:57.540 --> 06:02.660]  watching my YouTube videos have seen it. It is still going, man. You sent that thing to me months
[06:02.660 --> 06:06.100]  ago. It was warm when you sent it because in the in the periscope video, I'm wearing shorts.
[06:06.660 --> 06:11.700]  It's warm and he sent it to me and that thing is still rocking. If you say three months ago,
[06:11.700 --> 06:16.020]  four months ago at 10 dabs a day, whatever kind of math that is, that's a lot of dabs. Everyone
[06:16.100 --> 06:20.580]  looked at Joe. That's really funny. Did you compute? Yes, that is accurate.
[06:23.300 --> 06:28.740]  See a lot of dabs. So when it stood the test of time, the table is stood up. I appreciate the
[06:28.740 --> 06:34.180]  work. I'm going to give you a huge shout out. Is it a burniture dot big cartel dot com? Yes. Yes.
[06:34.180 --> 06:38.740]  You guys go there. Check that shit out. Tell him that you heard about it on the Irie or the
[06:38.740 --> 06:42.980]  Grow From Your Heart podcast and he will do something special for you. He'll make sure you
[06:42.980 --> 06:48.100]  get hooked to the order. Definitely. You can DM me if you want custom orders and stuff, too. If
[06:48.100 --> 06:53.380]  you got ideas or thoughts or stuff you might want to build, definitely DM me on Instagram at
[06:53.380 --> 07:00.340]  Bobo Blaster Co. Yeah, or definitely send me a message at the furniture. I asked you. I asked
[07:00.340 --> 07:04.820]  you what you could make into an email for me. And your answer was it's more about what I can't make
[07:04.820 --> 07:08.820]  into an email for you. So if you've got the funds and you think you want it turned into an email,
[07:08.820 --> 07:14.740]  he can probably do it if you're patient. Yes. Yes. Nice systems. That's that's what I wanted
[07:14.740 --> 07:19.700]  was a Nintendo, an old Nintendo and 64. But then I saw it done, so I didn't want it anymore. Sorry.
[07:19.700 --> 07:23.940]  Yeah, that's that's the thing. That's what's hard about this. Everybody's doing it now. It's it's
[07:23.940 --> 07:29.220]  an easy thing if you really know if you know you're if you're an average electrician and you
[07:29.220 --> 07:35.060]  can kind of understand some electrician, you can probably make it. And there's a billion D.D.Y.
[07:35.060 --> 07:41.140]  I mean, D.I. Oh, my God. I know we all said that. Yeah, the do it yourself videos for days on YouTube
[07:41.140 --> 07:47.940]  all day on forums and all the time. Superstone. That's all right. I'll cover for you. It's my
[07:47.940 --> 07:53.220]  fault. I gave him dad. You guys, I gave him some some shout out to Turpex and the lemon. Yes. Holy
[07:53.220 --> 07:57.620]  crap. Since we're doing shout out, I do owe one shout out to our good friends at Hitman Glass.
[07:57.620 --> 08:00.500]  Big shout out to our friends at Hitman Glass. When I'm shopping for glass, I want to buy something
[08:00.500 --> 08:05.780]  made in America by an American. Right now I'm taking dabs out of the hitman short stack. These
[08:05.780 --> 08:09.940]  guys were laughing at me because there's like a gram and a half of reclaims stuck in this thing.
[08:09.940 --> 08:14.340]  And like, what are you going to do with that? One level of that stack is literally just wax.
[08:14.900 --> 08:20.580]  This level is where all the wax is. So shout out to Hitman Glass. Shout out to the Chalice
[08:20.580 --> 08:24.500]  Festival. You guys, I'm trying to participate in the Chalice Festival. I want to be there this
[08:24.500 --> 08:28.820]  summer. So shout out to Hitman Dougie. Make sure you follow my friend Dougie. It's at Hitman Glass
[08:29.140 --> 08:34.260]  on Instagram. Also, make sure you check out www.hitmanglass.com. See what they've got available
[08:34.260 --> 08:39.220]  there. Don't buy glass from China, you guys. These rigs are made in America by Americans. These guys
[08:39.220 --> 08:43.460]  dab as hard as you do. When you see them at trade shows, they're dabbing. They're hanging out with
[08:43.460 --> 08:48.340]  this, their community. Get shit made in America. Support the economy. Don't buy glass made by a
[08:48.340 --> 08:52.500]  little kid with no shoes and no protective eyewear, no glasses. Little dude didn't get a
[08:52.500 --> 08:56.260]  lunch break. Got a fucking whip up against his ass all day. I'm just kidding. I'm sorry.
[08:56.980 --> 09:03.940]  That's true though. It's possibly true. If you're just $1 a day, you could have a $20
[09:03.940 --> 09:10.340]  mothership. Okay. So I'm going to jump right into another topic. You segwayed for me. Thank you.
[09:10.340 --> 09:14.260]  That's fucking beautiful. We talked about this on another episode, but there's a whole new group of
[09:14.260 --> 09:17.940]  friends here that are actually more involved in the cannabis industry. Have you guys seen the
[09:17.940 --> 09:25.380]  mothership rig that sold for $101,000? Was it that Sagan collab? Was that what you tagged me
[09:25.380 --> 09:29.940]  and Danny? That thing the other day? We were literally just talking about that this morning.
[09:29.940 --> 09:36.020]  Okay. Outrageous. Beautiful, beautiful piece, but outrageous, like crazy number.
[09:37.300 --> 09:42.580]  What? Yeah. Well, first off, I'm a huge Sagan fanboy, so shout out to Sagan because he's just
[09:42.580 --> 09:48.900]  God to me. So anything he touches, I'm like, yes, awesome. Amazing. But that's just outlandish.
[09:48.900 --> 09:57.780]  Okay. So say you won the Powerball. What do you mean? Can I change it? Can I make it my own colors?
[09:58.660 --> 10:03.220]  Just like it is. If you won the Powerball, would you throw it on $101,000 on a glass rig still?
[10:03.780 --> 10:10.260]  Sagan would live in my basement and blow all day. Please live with me. Build everything.
[10:10.260 --> 10:14.020]  So if you won $100,000, if you won that billion dollars, you just tie Sagan up and he'd be in the
[10:14.020 --> 10:20.340]  basement blowing a custom. All right. All right. Okay. I'm just high and stumbling around.
[10:20.340 --> 10:26.420]  Stumble into me. That's cool. There is a ... Oh man, just being a high kid now.
[10:27.860 --> 10:31.860]  Most of our listeners are right there with you. And if you're not, take a dab right now so that
[10:31.860 --> 10:35.940]  what Joe says makes sense. Quick. Let's hear it, Joe.
[10:35.940 --> 10:45.220]  Oh, the auction. So was that mothership event for charity of any kind? Was it all ... Because
[10:45.220 --> 10:50.820]  it was all silent auction style, I think. I think the charity was Scott Deppy's fucking pocket.
[10:50.820 --> 10:54.660]  That's what I think that charity was for. Yeah. I did not know. I was wondering-
[10:54.660 --> 10:56.900]  I'm really ... I don't know that there was a charity involved at all.
[10:56.900 --> 11:00.820]  Because the only way I could somehow justify spending $100,000 on a glass piece is if you
[11:00.820 --> 11:05.460]  could somehow write it off. And if it was involved with a charity, that might be the
[11:05.460 --> 11:07.140]  way that they finagle it. That would be awesome.
[11:07.140 --> 11:12.340]  I don't know. Unfortunately, I think it was at ... It was at one of the trade shows that
[11:12.340 --> 11:17.620]  happened on the West Coast. It was either Vegas or the West Coast. And mothership had a huge
[11:17.620 --> 11:22.580]  booth there. And instead of ... This is what I was told by somebody. Instead of selling mothership
[11:22.580 --> 11:26.580]  rigs, they've learned that they can make a lot more money by creating demand at these events
[11:26.580 --> 11:31.060]  because people are hyped. So that's how they got 101 instead of 100 is because two people
[11:31.060 --> 11:37.700]  were fighting and one dude said 101. And one guy said 100 and 101 got it. So I'm pretty sure it's
[11:37.700 --> 11:41.780]  just you go to the events ... And I've done it myself. I've bought overpriced fucking rigs at
[11:41.780 --> 11:45.700]  events because it's in front of me and it's hyped and it sounds like a good deal. And instead of it
[11:45.700 --> 11:50.340]  being 1,200, it's only 950 today. And so I feel like I got a sweet ass deal and you buy it and
[11:50.340 --> 11:53.140]  then you get home and you're like, oh fuck, I just bought this rig and I got to pay rent.
[11:53.300 --> 11:59.780]  We've all done something like that before, but that's how you create the hype. This dude next
[11:59.780 --> 12:04.180]  to me holds up his new rig. This show is sponsored by Hitman Glass. We're talking about mothership
[12:04.180 --> 12:08.420]  right now, but dude, this rig is nice. This rig comes from Illusion's Glass. It's the ill glass
[12:08.420 --> 12:13.700]  flux capacitor. It is the right size. It's got a quartz banger on it. I like the mouthpiece on it
[12:13.700 --> 12:17.860]  and it's sturdy enough for the email. So nice purchase, dude. Yeah, I'm loving it. I got it
[12:17.860 --> 12:21.780]  a half off actually at Illusion's. Seed boulder. They got them on the fucking hype. They marked it
[12:21.780 --> 12:26.020]  up double what it should be and sold it to you at half price. Listen, I'll take it any day. That's
[12:26.020 --> 12:30.340]  a good rig. I like it. I like how thick the glass is. If you could tell it's not made by some Chinese
[12:30.340 --> 12:36.420]  kid with no protective eyewear. It was made in Colorado at Illglass. So we can all agree that
[12:36.420 --> 12:42.340]  that rig was a little bit overpriced, right? Yeah. All right. Even the Sagan fanboy over here is like,
[12:42.340 --> 12:50.340]  yeah, that was too much. Isn't any rig over, say, realistically $2,500 overpriced? I 100%
[12:50.340 --> 12:57.700]  understand that you're paying for the craftsmanship and the dedication that the person has put into
[12:57.700 --> 13:02.420]  learning and perfecting an art form. And his gas, what you're really in the time and all of that
[13:02.420 --> 13:08.020]  protective eyewear he had to buy. But like, but I'm just trying to think of a realistic number that
[13:08.020 --> 13:13.700]  isn't affected by market value or like the value the market's putting. It kind of depends on.
[13:14.260 --> 13:18.100]  I'm sure everybody in this room makes a different paycheck and it kind of depends on. Oh yeah,
[13:18.900 --> 13:22.500]  that's too much for a rig. And different people will be like, yeah, I pay that for a rig. And it
[13:22.500 --> 13:25.620]  just kind of depends on where you are. And there've been times in my life where I'd have been like a
[13:25.620 --> 13:29.460]  hundred bucks for a glass pipe. Fuck you. But now they're, I'm like sitting here hitting this hit
[13:29.460 --> 13:34.900]  man short stack that we all know is not a hundred bucks. So just times have changed and people
[13:34.900 --> 13:39.300]  change. So it's all, it's all a, what is it subjective? Like what's over pro but yeah, it's
[13:39.300 --> 13:43.620]  been an over a thousand or 2000 bucks for a piece of glass you could drop and break. And this rig
[13:43.620 --> 13:47.780]  over here, this one is closer to the four or five and it hits like a boss and it's a hash pipe still
[13:47.780 --> 13:51.620]  no matter how much you pay for it, how pretty it is. It's a hash pipe. That's what I mean. Like,
[13:52.180 --> 13:57.620]  the only way I could feel like I would justify even spending a reasonable amount of money is
[13:57.620 --> 14:02.180]  if you're buying it for a sculpture, like aspect of it, like a banjo piece for instance, right?
[14:02.180 --> 14:08.980]  Like we just went to a lazy lion, like the banjo Joe P it's like more of an art piece than anything.
[14:08.980 --> 14:13.780]  It's a sculpture. It's every like, even that I don't even think is anywhere near a hundred grand.
[14:13.780 --> 14:18.740]  Right. Right. But there are so many things I could buy a car with, I could buy four cars,
[14:18.740 --> 14:22.820]  but by a hundred really nice car for buy a house. Like I could buy a college education with that
[14:22.820 --> 14:29.540]  kind of money. Well, a week or two at college. You could realistically own a skyscraper in Detroit
[14:29.540 --> 14:37.220]  with that much. You could own fucking Detroit. Sorry, Detroit, that was rude. But I mean,
[14:38.260 --> 14:42.340]  you could buy a few blocks probably. All right. I'm going to, we're going to move on from
[14:44.740 --> 14:48.820]  no, this is, there's nothing incorrect about those statements.
[14:51.620 --> 14:57.220]  I mean, nothing negative. That's very true. Me too. Me as well. I'm just saying why are rigs?
[14:57.220 --> 15:04.020]  $25,000. Yeah. There are a few, there's one, uh, there's like maybe an SD Rhino rig. I'd pay good
[15:04.020 --> 15:09.220]  money for, and probably a couple of coil pieces that I pay good money for. But then you guys ever
[15:09.220 --> 15:12.100]  have that feeling when you're like, I'm going to go buy something and you get to the store and you
[15:12.100 --> 15:16.100]  grab it and you carry it up to the cash register and the lady tells you how much it is and something
[15:16.100 --> 15:20.740]  inside you is like, I just want to fucking put it back. Like I have to take that much money out of
[15:20.740 --> 15:26.180]  my pocket and give it to you. Like I was cool with it until like this moment. Like, no, like,
[15:26.180 --> 15:31.860]  yeah, you just such a bitch. I almost, I almost bought a mothership for 2,500 bucks. And the day
[15:31.860 --> 15:35.700]  before I drove to Denver to go get it, I woke up and I was like, I have to take all these hundred
[15:35.700 --> 15:40.020]  dollar bills and give them to somebody right now. Like it was a cool idea. Can I just hold this and
[15:40.020 --> 15:43.620]  take a couple of laps around the store and I'll just feel right. Like I held it. It was good.
[15:43.620 --> 15:46.660]  Let me take some pictures and put it on Instagram. Act like it was mine for a minute.
[15:46.660 --> 15:47.380]  And you can have it back.
[15:47.380 --> 15:49.060]  Look at what I touched.
[15:50.180 --> 15:55.300]  Yeah. So needless to say, I came to my senses and did not purchase a $2,500 mothership. I did.
[15:55.300 --> 15:59.780]  There's just something that I can't do that. It feels weird. That's a lot of money. This is going
[15:59.780 --> 16:03.060]  to be the most expensive rig on the table for a long time. And this was actually sent to me by
[16:03.060 --> 16:07.540]  our friends at Hitman Glass. So this, this will remain the priciest rig on the table for quite a
[16:08.260 --> 16:13.940]  while. I'm, I don't want anybody to think that I'm hating on these dudes who are making bank,
[16:13.940 --> 16:16.340]  selling their glass. That's amazing. And awesome.
[16:16.340 --> 16:20.100]  That's it's great that these guys can support their families and their kids are going to college
[16:20.100 --> 16:22.740]  now because this dude made art and it's sold for a lot of money.
[16:22.740 --> 16:27.540]  When you approach it from, okay. See, I was never, I was not approaching my argument from the art
[16:27.540 --> 16:31.460]  standpoint. I was approaching it from the, this is a bong.
[16:32.020 --> 16:36.660]  This is a B word. I dropped the B word, but it's a bong.
[16:36.660 --> 16:41.860]  Yes. It's a, it's still a hashpipe no matter what you do to it. Yeah. It's no matter how pretty it
[16:41.860 --> 16:47.140]  is. So I talked about it on another episode, but let's, let's look at a picture of it since we're,
[16:47.140 --> 16:50.260]  we're all going to this other people that listened to that episode might be listening to this one and
[16:50.260 --> 16:53.620]  didn't hear that episode. So let's go to Instagram right quick. And I want to pull up a picture and
[16:53.620 --> 16:58.260]  share it with everybody so we can all see it together. Uh, crap. I searched for a lot of
[16:58.260 --> 17:01.780]  stuff here. We're just going to go hashtag mothership and it'll come up. Trust me.
[17:01.780 --> 17:04.420]  I'm sure it's the first thing. Yeah. Right.
[17:04.420 --> 17:08.180]  Give me the first six spiders. Just different angles.
[17:08.180 --> 17:12.820]  So do you, can we agree? Wow. I don't see it yet. Can we all agree that it looks like something
[17:12.820 --> 17:18.580]  that maybe Tim Burton would have made or maybe if Les Claypool had become a glassblower, maybe
[17:18.580 --> 17:21.540]  Les Claypool would have made this thing. There's a picture of it here, but it's not the picture
[17:21.540 --> 17:26.580]  I'm looking for. Yeah. Shout out to Primus all day there. They played yesterday in California
[17:26.580 --> 17:31.540]  and I heard the show was amazing. So let's look at this piece right here. Uh, it is God on the top,
[17:31.540 --> 17:37.140]  the mouthpiece is supposed to be a moon. Then it has got, I think that color is called stardust,
[17:37.140 --> 17:41.540]  but it's got other stuff in it with this like metallic iridescent glittery shit that just
[17:41.540 --> 17:48.180]  drives my eyes crazy. I can't even focus on it properly. Uh, then it is, it's a Fabergé egg
[17:48.180 --> 17:53.460]  underneath that, but it's made with such dark glass. You can't see through it to see the proper
[17:53.460 --> 18:00.820]  shape of the egg and it looks like a hand grenade to me. You guys agree with that? It's too fucking
[18:00.820 --> 18:08.900]  much. It's kind of gaudy. It is. It's like reflected stained glass on a Lake that's rippling.
[18:08.900 --> 18:16.340]  Yeah, it's nice, but I mean, it's so ugly at the same time. A hundred grand. Mothership is known
[18:16.340 --> 18:20.420]  101. Yeah. It's that extra one. They still got to pay taxes on it. Mothership is known for really
[18:20.740 --> 18:26.340]  smooth, sleek, tight glass with no extra shit on it and really nice function. Yeah. Clear function,
[18:26.340 --> 18:32.100]  like a clear color, maybe like a piss yellow lemon drop or the pink or blue. The Azure blue
[18:32.100 --> 18:37.460]  is really nice. And this thing is just gaudy and overdone in my opinion, this little moon down here,
[18:37.460 --> 18:43.060]  they sent that to the moon, uh, to space in a weather balloon. Uh, yeah, he did a whole set of
[18:43.060 --> 18:48.980]  pendies. Yeah. Yeah. So it's got these moons around it. It's got a bunch of moons attached to it.
[18:48.980 --> 18:53.300]  And that's supposed to be the actual phases of the moon. If you'd spin it around, it goes through
[18:53.300 --> 19:00.340]  the moon phases. It looks like they made a cheap bong and glued a bunch of fucking moons onto it.
[19:00.340 --> 19:08.180]  In my opinion, I want to buy it and glue a little rocket ship to it. It's just my opinion. All right,
[19:08.180 --> 19:13.780]  I'm going to quit bashing this mother ship. I'm being rude now. And there goes Russell Jeff's
[19:13.780 --> 19:21.460]  custom, I read genetics, mothership not coming in the mail. Right? Ever. They can send me one of
[19:21.460 --> 19:26.260]  the race car series any day of the week. That blue race car is dope. The, uh, there's a green race
[19:26.260 --> 19:30.660]  car series. I got cash in my pocket. Somebody bought the red one up right away. Of course.
[19:30.660 --> 19:34.900]  It's beautiful. Yeah. It's so gorgeous. But that race car series, I will take it. Uh, anything
[19:34.900 --> 19:39.780]  that's not a fixie for mothership. I'm happy. What I want to say is the reason that cosmic
[19:39.780 --> 19:45.140]  piece gets away with it is because it is a co lab because it's not a straight up mothership piece.
[19:45.140 --> 19:50.340]  It's a mothership base. And then an artist went to town on it with the fuck to town on it too. And so
[19:50.340 --> 19:54.900]  that's why it is what it is. And that will probably never get smoked out of, you know, they were
[19:54.900 --> 19:58.500]  dabbing out of it, bro. Like hours after they bought it, there are pictures on Instagram of
[19:58.500 --> 20:03.060]  these dudes dabbing out of it. If you didn't, you're just ridiculous. Then you're crazy. A
[20:03.060 --> 20:07.780]  hundred grand on a rig. Like how often are you really going to use that? Yeah. I would spend
[20:07.780 --> 20:11.620]  that much money. I would have to use it every single day. Just to be like, I'd be afraid to
[20:11.620 --> 20:15.780]  fuck with it. My hand would be on it while you dab out of it. My hand would be on it while you dab
[20:15.780 --> 20:20.740]  out of it. I'd be like, no, I got it. Like you, you work this. You stick your head in the case.
[20:22.100 --> 20:27.540]  It's a padded room. You go into it to take dabs. Yeah. All right. So, um, you guys check out this
[20:27.540 --> 20:31.300]  rig. If you'd go to a mothership glass on Instagram, you'll see what we're talking about.
[20:31.300 --> 20:37.380]  It is radonkulous. Um, also here's something I've been seeing on, uh, social media sites. Have you
[20:37.380 --> 20:46.100]  guys seen the super clear hash that somebody made super clear? It is clear as glass in which,
[20:46.100 --> 20:54.260]  in which state are you talking about? Not, not, not United States. Like which, which phase is the
[20:54.260 --> 20:59.220]  hash in? So they're holding it in their hand with a rubber glove and behind them is an across
[20:59.220 --> 21:03.220]  international vac oven. And they just hold it in front of the camera and took the picture.
[21:03.220 --> 21:07.140]  And there was no caption. And the picture went up and stayed up for like three or four days
[21:07.140 --> 21:11.700]  and people went nuts over this hash because it was as clear as this rig. It was super clear. You
[21:11.700 --> 21:17.060]  guys didn't see it. No. Can I see this? Well, I'm just going to ruin all your guys' fun. It was ice
[21:18.180 --> 21:21.940]  or it was just straight up a piece of ice, but since they wore a rubber glove and took a picture
[21:21.940 --> 21:26.180]  of it in front of a vac oven and didn't post anything, everybody's mind just went, look at
[21:26.180 --> 21:32.820]  that clear hash. And everybody just jerked off and had a fucking orgasm to it. It was so nice.
[21:32.900 --> 21:38.420]  Yeah. So many of my friends, I'm, I'm a lot of people's cannabis expert. You know what I mean?
[21:38.420 --> 21:41.940]  I'm their weed guy and people were sending me the picture all day. Like, is this real? What is this?
[21:41.940 --> 21:46.580]  Is this real? And finally I messaged them. Yeah. Like, where can you find this? How much a gram?
[21:46.580 --> 21:50.580]  And so I messaged him. I was like, what is that exactly? It looks like ice to me. And they're
[21:50.580 --> 21:57.140]  like, it's ice. Okay, nice. Good call. Like that makes sense. There's no comment or anything. They
[21:57.140 --> 22:00.900]  just posted the picture and they just let everybody assume and everybody's minds went
[22:00.900 --> 22:05.540]  right to, Oh my God, look at this hash. Cause they saw rubber gloves in a vac oven. And that's
[22:05.540 --> 22:08.980]  what, you know, if you see lotion and a Kleenex in your buddy's bedroom, you think he's jerking
[22:08.980 --> 22:12.660]  off. It's if you got fucking vac oven and rubber gloves, you're making hash. It's kind of just how
[22:12.660 --> 22:16.740]  it goes. The girl in the room almost spit her water on me just now. The only female in the room
[22:16.740 --> 22:22.740]  almost lost her shit. I'm sorry for that. No, you're fine. That was good. All right. So we talked
[22:22.740 --> 22:25.140]  about that on the show yesterday, but you guys were more in the loop a little bit. The guys that
[22:25.140 --> 22:29.300]  were here yesterday, uh, our local dudes that aren't, uh, is hip into the scene. No offense
[22:29.300 --> 22:34.660]  if you guys are listening, you know what I'm saying? Uh, so you guys just moved here. You guys
[22:34.660 --> 22:39.860]  got a brand new house. You guys were spoiled because you moved into sloppy's house. Uh,
[22:39.860 --> 22:44.900]  that may have already been equipped for growing. If you had chosen to grow in there. Yeah. A lot
[22:44.900 --> 22:49.300]  of people that are going to move here aren't going to have that advantage. So there's a few minutes
[22:49.300 --> 22:54.180]  left in the show that we can keep going, uh, for a few minutes, let's talk about things that if
[22:54.180 --> 22:58.900]  people were going to move to a house in Colorado and you plan to grow, what are some things you
[22:58.900 --> 23:03.780]  should look at when you're looking for a house before you move in? Like have this in mind before
[23:03.780 --> 23:07.460]  I move here, look at this when you're looking at houses, if you plan to grow there, like the first
[23:07.460 --> 23:11.220]  thing just to get it rolling, like make sure you've got enough electricity coming into the house.
[23:11.860 --> 23:17.700]  The power is really limited. If you get an older house, uh, you may have like a 50 or an 80 amp,
[23:17.700 --> 23:22.980]  uh, maximum in your house, my house, we can pull 200 amps here. So we, I'm in a nice, big, fancy
[23:22.980 --> 23:26.980]  residential area, but some homes you can't pull enough power to run more than two or three or
[23:27.060 --> 23:31.300]  three or four lights. So definitely check out the electricity. If you're going to have an
[23:31.300 --> 23:35.620]  electrician come, uh, here's a good segue into the next thing. Check out the landlord.
[23:36.260 --> 23:39.780]  That's something to really think about. You just rolled your eyes. You had a fucking experience.
[23:39.780 --> 23:46.100]  I could see it on your face. Not with growing, but like, yeah, just landlords in general. Yeah.
[23:46.100 --> 23:49.780]  So imagine if that dickhead landlord is at your front door and you've got to grow in the basement,
[23:49.780 --> 23:53.460]  he wants to come in and do something and there's no keeping him out. You got to make sure you got
[23:53.460 --> 23:58.500]  a good landlord. Uh, fortunately my landlord lives in Michigan, so they have been here once
[23:58.500 --> 24:02.580]  since I've moved in in the past, like eight years and they drive by when they came to visit their
[24:02.580 --> 24:05.460]  family and they're like, the front yard looks great. Thank you. And that was pretty much what
[24:05.460 --> 24:10.500]  I got from them. So yeah. So find a landlord. If you can find one of those rental agencies
[24:10.500 --> 24:13.940]  that they rent you the house and they forget about you. As long as you send that check every month,
[24:13.940 --> 24:20.100]  if you can find a place like that, those are rare in Colorado because they're, because they are
[24:20.100 --> 24:27.620]  aware of what people are renting houses to do. Very true. Uh, you really want to find like a
[24:27.620 --> 24:33.860]  local landlord if you are planning to grow. It's very easy to grow legally here. There's no reason
[24:33.860 --> 24:43.620]  to grow illegally when it's so easy to have all your paperwork in order. Uh, and then, and uh,
[24:43.620 --> 24:47.460]  oh, I forgot where I was going with that. All right, we'll have a good fine. But yeah, yeah.
[24:47.460 --> 24:54.500]  There's a other things for your grow room too. Like, uh, what are you doing for your ventilation?
[24:54.500 --> 24:58.900]  Yes. Is your landlord cool with you modifying the house? Oh yeah. He might have to cut some
[24:58.900 --> 25:05.540]  ducting holes. Yeah. You environment is key. Think about how many rooms does the house have?
[25:05.540 --> 25:11.460]  Are you going to have enough room to adequately grow? Don't have crazy expectations.
[25:11.460 --> 25:16.020]  Not your two closets and your one little room. And then all of a sudden you have three bedrooms
[25:16.020 --> 25:20.420]  filled. You're like, I don't know what happened. That's how it goes. That's how growing goes. So
[25:20.420 --> 25:23.380]  you moved to Colorado, you hang one light and you're like, look, I grew weed. You're like,
[25:23.380 --> 25:27.540]  well now I need a bedroom and a flower room. And you're like, now I need veg, flower, clones,
[25:27.540 --> 25:30.900]  and moms. You're like, no, I'm going to breed in this other room. And then you're like, oh shit,
[25:30.900 --> 25:36.580]  now where do I sleep? And then you go in another house with another landlord and doing it all over.
[25:36.580 --> 25:41.620]  Yeah. That shit happens in Colorado. So like Joe said, have a good roommate or have a good landlord.
[25:41.620 --> 25:45.220]  Don't get any fucking roommates. You're growing weed. That'll pay the other bills. Don't get any
[25:45.220 --> 25:48.980]  roommates. Don't do that. That'll, that'll screw everything up. Angry roommates are one of the,
[25:48.980 --> 25:53.540]  and no offense, but angry girlfriends and angry roommates are one of the leading causes of garden
[25:53.540 --> 25:58.020]  failure. That shit will just ruin angry partners. Don't have another partner. Do it yourself. Get
[25:58.020 --> 26:03.300]  your own house. Set that shit up. Another thing, make sure there is access to water. You need to
[26:03.300 --> 26:09.140]  get plenty of water to your garden. You're going to need, I say probably about five gallons of
[26:09.140 --> 26:13.540]  water per light every three days. That's every thousand watt light. You'll need about five
[26:13.540 --> 26:17.380]  gallons of water every three days. That's in my experience. If it's too hot, you're going to have
[26:17.380 --> 26:22.500]  to get more water. Find a place that you can control the temperature. A lot of basements get
[26:22.500 --> 26:25.780]  really, really cold and dank in the winter. You're going to think this is going to be awesome, but
[26:25.780 --> 26:31.380]  that coldness will give you powdery mildew. That drastic change from hot to cold is a huge, huge
[26:31.380 --> 26:34.580]  cause of powdery mildew. The plants don't know what to do with that. They'll freak out. You'll
[26:34.580 --> 26:39.780]  get mold. You'll fuck up the whole crop. Also, a lot of the basements around here, the basements
[26:39.780 --> 26:44.740]  are just dirty. You would not want to grow in any basement around here until you frame it out
[26:44.740 --> 26:49.060]  or build something in there. Look and see how dirty, how dusty, how funky the place is. Check
[26:49.060 --> 26:53.140]  your pipes. Make sure you're not going to have any busting pipes in the basement. I know I keep
[26:53.140 --> 26:57.380]  saying basements, but basements are the best place for a grow, in my opinion. The temperature is
[26:57.380 --> 27:03.700]  easier to maintain. Nobody goes down there. It's a little more easy to keep private. Make sure it's
[27:03.700 --> 27:08.020]  not real dirty. Make sure you got somewhere for the water to go. Make sure maybe you got a floor
[27:08.020 --> 27:12.340]  drain or a way to get rid of the water. Maybe if you got an old bathroom shower, an old shower down
[27:12.340 --> 27:15.780]  in the basement or an old toilet down there, make sure you just have somewhere to dispose of water
[27:15.780 --> 27:21.060]  because there will be water. Make sure your neighbors aren't right on top of you. My neighbors
[27:21.060 --> 27:25.220]  are a few feet away. If they were any closer, I would be uncomfortable having any blowers coming
[27:25.220 --> 27:30.100]  out of any windows. It wouldn't do it. So make sure your neighbors are cool. Make sure you don't
[27:30.100 --> 27:37.940]  live next to any cops. That should be rule number one, actually. Or anything. Tip number one.
[27:38.980 --> 27:42.420]  Or just bust it out right in front of the cops house and they'll never fucking notice because
[27:42.420 --> 27:46.260]  they'll be like, why would that asshole grow there? Just carry in grow. Here's another tip.
[27:46.260 --> 27:51.540]  When you move in, don't go carrying in your grow lights and your hydro setup all at one time.
[27:51.540 --> 27:55.620]  Kind of wait for the, if you can drive. Yeah, yeah. If you can drive the car into the garage
[27:55.620 --> 28:01.060]  and unload there, do that. Don't show up with seven lights. The cardboard sign that says we grow.
[28:01.060 --> 28:05.300]  Yeah. The fluorescent light and the guy spinning a sign outside that says trap house.
[28:08.260 --> 28:14.580]  It's like, I can just see it too. Is it? Yeah. Fucking dancing and spinning a sign trap house.
[28:14.580 --> 28:21.540]  We throw raves on Friday. $20 grams. $20 grams. We're getting way, but so all right.
[28:23.460 --> 28:27.300]  We're getting high over here. You need electricity. You need water. You need
[28:27.300 --> 28:31.620]  somewhere to get rid of the water. You need cleanliness. You need some way to feel secure.
[28:31.620 --> 28:36.980]  Don't buy a house. It's got old ass doors, old ass doorknobs. Pay attention to your neighborhood.
[28:36.980 --> 28:41.380]  It's easier to get away with the grow in the hood, but it's also easier to get your grow
[28:41.380 --> 28:45.380]  fucking stolen in the hood. So there's a kind of a boundary you have to work with there.
[28:45.380 --> 28:49.460]  You guys are right on that cusp in your new house. It's kind of, it's hood enough,
[28:49.460 --> 28:54.740]  but it's a little hood. Yeah. Well, our neighbors seem pretty cool. I haven't had any issues.
[28:54.740 --> 28:59.300]  They all are happy. Well, slop was there before us. So that's the slop regulated.
[28:59.300 --> 29:03.300]  Yeah. Slop came in and laid down the law. Shout out to sloppy for not taking any shit.
[29:03.940 --> 29:07.780]  I like that kid. I love that kid. Slop. I owe you a hug, bro. Sloppy. Uh, yeah,
[29:07.780 --> 29:12.180]  actually grateful. That ticket's secret. Secret fact. He's actually a little,
[29:12.180 --> 29:15.860]  there's a little beef going on with you guys. You don't even know about sloppy.
[29:16.660 --> 29:22.900]  It can't be beef. I'm a vegetarian brother. Oh, that's sloppy. I love you. I'll come give you a
[29:22.900 --> 29:27.540]  hug. I'll fucking put on my shoes and drive over there after this, even though I should not because
[29:27.540 --> 29:30.740]  it's late, but I'm going to do that because I don't want no beef. I haven't been to your new
[29:30.740 --> 29:33.860]  house yet. You're the man. I owe you that. You gave me some grateful dead tickets, bro.
[29:38.180 --> 29:40.660]  But then you just got to keep in mind. I worked 50 miles.
[29:42.900 --> 29:45.380]  He said that he's something to be honest. I know he works a lot, but bro,
[29:49.620 --> 29:53.540]  I'm not complaining, but I haven't had a day off in over 32 days. The last time I counted was 32
[29:53.540 --> 29:58.180]  days to my last day off. So sorry, sloppy. I love you on day 36. When I get that day off,
[29:58.180 --> 30:00.820]  I'm going to come give you a hug and a kiss on the cheek. I'll play with that big old fucking
[30:00.820 --> 30:06.660]  Afro. You're growing. I was just commenting on it last night. It is so round and perfect.
[30:07.380 --> 30:13.620]  Let's name sloppies Afro. Oh wait, it's got to be something really good. Listeners call to action.
[30:13.620 --> 30:17.780]  We would like you to name my friend's sloppies Afro hit me up on the growth from your heart
[30:17.780 --> 30:24.500]  podcast, Twitter page at GFYH podcast and name sloppies Afro hashtag name sloppies Afro.
[30:25.140 --> 30:28.180]  I don't have a Twitter, but I might get one.
[30:30.980 --> 30:35.540]  It's named Frodo. That's what it's fucking name is contest over contest over
[30:36.580 --> 30:39.940]  to the left. You want a, a flux capacitor rig from
[30:39.940 --> 30:43.380]  Congratulations. You won half off.
[30:44.980 --> 30:46.260]  We only marked it up triple price.
[30:48.980 --> 30:51.940]  So if you've made it listening this far, I fucking love you guys. Thanks for listening
[30:51.940 --> 30:56.820]  to our podcast. A lot, a lot of fun. Um, somebody told me it would be really funny if I said,
[30:57.700 --> 31:02.180]  Hey Siri, Google golden goat on my podcast, because a lot of people have an app on their
[31:02.180 --> 31:05.620]  phone called Siri. And if you say, Hey Siri, it activates, it makes it start working. So now
[31:05.620 --> 31:10.020]  people's phones are randomly Googling golden goat. If that worked, uh, ha ha. And I'm sorry,
[31:10.020 --> 31:12.820]  somebody told me to try that. Let me know if that worked. If I fucked up your phone,
[31:12.820 --> 31:18.660]  that's really funny to me. If I fucked up your phone, I'm laughing about it.
[31:18.660 --> 31:22.580]  We're all laughing. If you've got, Hey Siri turned on, that was your fault.
[31:23.780 --> 31:28.980]  She never turned on. My phone didn't fuck up. All right. So guys, I'm going to put together
[31:28.980 --> 31:32.900]  an episode all about getting your badge. I'm pretty sure we did a short episode about that,
[31:32.900 --> 31:38.260]  but two, maybe three people have asked me to do an episode all about getting your badge.
[31:38.260 --> 31:42.740]  Uh, also shout out to the mama that worked on my dreadlocks for me. She is one of the people
[31:42.740 --> 31:46.980]  that said I should do an episode about getting her bad badge. She's a manager at a shop. And a lot of
[31:46.980 --> 31:51.140]  people come in without badges and ask her how to do it. So if she had a podcast to refer them to
[31:51.140 --> 31:54.580]  and help her out. So I'm going to make that episode. Uh, thanks for working on my dreads.
[31:54.580 --> 31:59.300]  I'll get that episode for you. The dreads look sweet. They feel so good. I appreciate it. Um,
[31:59.300 --> 32:03.300]  so we should shout out everybody's Twitter pages or Instagram or some way to find all these weird
[32:03.300 --> 32:07.460]  fuckers that you guys were just listening to a bunch of good people. So, uh, we'll start over
[32:07.460 --> 32:14.260]  here. You said you had an Instagram, right? Yeah. It's creative K R E A T I V E underscore chaos.
[32:15.220 --> 32:16.180]  That is creative.
[32:19.220 --> 32:22.180]  Uh, Joe Buzzy, do you have any way that you'd like people to follow you or do you just want
[32:22.180 --> 32:26.580]  to remain anonymous over here? Well, yeah, I'm good. It's all good. That's cool. We understand.
[32:27.300 --> 32:31.060]  Anybody can figure it out the way I understand. It's not difficult. If you really tried,
[32:31.700 --> 32:34.740]  you got anything you want to share with us, Caesar, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook.
[32:34.740 --> 32:40.660]  I mean, I, I really don't do anything exciting. If you want to follow me, uh, building my Jeep
[32:40.900 --> 32:48.660]  at a Chavo 45, 18 C H A V O four or five one eight. Nice. Someone will check that out. You

[32:58.980 --> 33:02.420]  What are you into? If I'm trying to date you, what are you into?

[33:25.620 --> 33:28.980]  So you're looking for a girl that likes Italian food, got big boobs,
[33:28.980 --> 33:32.900]  ready to go on the sunset, riding the Jeep, smoke some good dough. Yeah. Okay.
[33:33.620 --> 33:39.460]  And in the Manhattan area, I mean, you're like, yeah, I'll fucking drive. I'll go anywhere around
[33:39.460 --> 33:47.220]  the tri-state. I mean, there's one most powerful thing out here in the world and that is pussy.
[33:49.060 --> 33:54.740]  I'm not going to edit that out. I wondered for a minute. I was like, am I going to take that out?
[33:54.740 --> 33:58.500]  No, I'm fucking not. Cause I think the man is right. I think you're right. Let it ride.
[33:58.500 --> 34:01.220]  Let it ride. I like your style. Thank you for coming. Thanks for taking time out of your day.
[34:01.540 --> 34:07.060]  Thanks for having me. Awesome. How about you young lady? Yes. I am the traveling stoner
[34:07.060 --> 34:12.420]  on Instagram and all other social media. All other social medias. Are you traveling?
[34:12.420 --> 34:15.860]  Yes. Are you a stoner? Yes. All right. I just want to make sure you're not fucking around.
[34:15.860 --> 34:20.100]  Never. Not faking the funk. Never. So you're the one that I'm talking to a lot of the time.
[34:20.100 --> 34:25.940]  Yes. That is me. I knew that was going to come up once I said it. I was pretty sure that was you.
[34:26.820 --> 34:31.700]  Okay. So now I can finally tell you that it was the reason I even got a Periscope was because my
[34:31.700 --> 34:36.020]  favorite thing is when he would jump into your Periscopes, the way you say Bobo Blaster Co.
[34:36.020 --> 34:42.900]  used to make me giggle so much. I went and got a Periscope so I could hear you say the traveling
[34:42.900 --> 34:48.740]  stoner. I wish you would have been there the first time. I giggled so hard. She was so excited. She's
[34:48.740 --> 34:53.460]  like, wait for it. Wait for it. Cause there's a delay. So you're like, wait for it. Oh, hello.
[34:54.260 --> 35:00.100]  And she's like, yes. Nice. I'm making people giggle. Yes. On Periscope. You guys follow me
[35:00.100 --> 35:04.340]  on Periscope. It's fun. I don't do as many videos as I used to because I'm fucking working a lot.
[35:04.340 --> 35:09.460]  Slop. Sloppy bro. I love you, man. I'm sorry. I'm just busy, dude. Come on. We still got a bromance.
[35:09.460 --> 35:15.460]  You're still my Tuesday bitch. So make sure you check out the traveling stoner. Make sure you
[35:15.460 --> 35:18.900]  check out the traveling stoner follower. I'm sure she posted some good pictures. I might look one
[35:18.980 --> 35:27.060]  day. Okay. Now, now my friend over here, Mr. Bobo blaster Co. Yes. You've got a lot of stuff to
[35:27.060 --> 35:30.980]  plug. You got the furniture stuff. How can people find furniture? Yeah. The easiest way to find
[35:30.980 --> 35:39.700]  burniture is a burniture.bigcartel.com or you can hit me up on Instagram at a Bobo blaster Co. C O
[35:40.580 --> 35:46.900]  blaster Co. She's giggling right in my face. That's good. It's fucking funny. I fully endorse
[35:46.900 --> 35:50.340]  his product. You guys, it takes a lot to get me to endorse your product. The only brands I really
[35:50.340 --> 35:56.500]  represent right now are highly educated titanium oil slick hit man glass, a Turpex of course,
[35:56.500 --> 36:00.820]  team green and healthy. And then Bobo blaster Co the furniture because that shit works.
[36:01.620 --> 36:05.780]  I put it to the test. Yeah. I'm happy. Cause I was hoping that I was, I was expecting you to come
[36:05.780 --> 36:09.860]  back with like, all right, I gave you like a six, a five. And I was like, all right, I gotta go back
[36:09.860 --> 36:13.780]  to the drawing table, fix out a little tweaks and send you a new one. I'm like, all right,
[36:13.780 --> 36:17.940]  test this one. The green button gets warm. Yes. Like my only complaint. That's the only,
[36:17.940 --> 36:22.100]  I mean, it doesn't, my only issue and I've already fixed it. That's what I've said. That's why I can't
[36:22.100 --> 36:26.820]  wait to refurbish that one back to brand new for you. You go add two more at the other end. Yes.
[36:26.820 --> 36:30.820]  I'm just kidding. It'd be way too crowded. It'd get hectic. I appreciate the table though. You
[36:30.820 --> 36:34.740]  guys check out the tables when you buy your table. If there's a comment section on big cartel, I do
[36:34.740 --> 36:37.620]  not know what the shopping cart looks like. If there's a comment section, make sure you type in
[36:37.620 --> 36:41.140]  there. I heard about this through Rasta Jeff Rasta. Jeff told me something grew from your heart
[36:42.100 --> 36:44.980]  let him know so that we can high five each other and he knows where the sales are coming from,
[36:44.980 --> 36:47.780]  where the business has happened. And it's always nice for us to know that stuff.
[36:47.780 --> 36:52.900]  We appreciate that kind of thing. So, um, does anybody have any sort of important message you'd
[36:52.900 --> 36:57.700]  like to relate to the world before I start closing up the show here? No, I got nothing.
[36:57.700 --> 37:02.260]  All right. He's got nothing. My message for the day is don't be a dick. It's good enough, right?
[37:02.260 --> 37:06.420]  Don't be a dick. Be nice. Give each other a hug. It's a new year. Uh, forgive somebody,
[37:06.420 --> 37:09.060]  give them a new start. All right, we're going to wrap up the show. I want to thank all you guys
[37:09.060 --> 37:13.940]  for coming. That's fucking awesome. I think these guys will all be back. Even the folks from New
[37:13.940 --> 37:17.220]  York, this guy's going to move here. This guy's going to come visit again. We're going to go
[37:17.220 --> 37:20.740]  now. He's a commander. He's going to come move out here. You know what? There's two States that
[37:20.740 --> 37:26.980]  I've come visit you guys. Yes. Nice. No, we're going to get traveling Italian.
[37:29.060 --> 37:31.380]  The traveling Cuban. Okay. I'm Cuban.
[37:35.380 --> 37:37.220]  All right, you guys, I'm gonna start wrapping up the show. I want to thank everybody for
[37:37.220 --> 37:40.420]  listening. I'll be back in a few days with another episode. Make sure you check out our

[38:07.940 --> 38:12.260]  right? There's a donation button. It looks like a little PayPal logo. It's oddly misshapen.
[38:12.260 --> 38:15.620]  Uh, I'm not good at building websites. Uh, if you throw some money in there, maybe I'll hire
[38:15.620 --> 38:20.100]  a web designer. He'll fix that fucking thing. Uh, honestly, what that goes to, uh, that goes to all
[38:20.100 --> 38:23.460]  of the blue host fees to keep the website alive, to keep this podcast coming to you. So if you'd
[38:23.460 --> 38:26.660]  like to make a contribution, I would definitely appreciate it. This show will always be free.
[38:26.660 --> 38:29.780]  It comes from my heart. Cause I love you guys. I love growing cannabis. I want you to grow better
[38:29.780 --> 38:33.380]  cannabis. The show will always be free, but if you want to contribute, I will give you a huge
[38:33.380 --> 38:36.900]  shout out on the show. Uh, if you have a topic you'd like to discuss and you throw something in
[38:36.900 --> 38:40.980]  there, your topic comes up first. That's just how shit works, right? If you throw a 50 in the DJ's
[38:40.980 --> 38:44.180]  tip jar and you write a song on there, he will play whatever song you wrote on there. Next.
[38:44.180 --> 38:48.660]  I worked the very same way. All right, you guys, I think that's all I've got for you. I want to
[38:48.660 --> 38:52.180]  give a huge shout out to my ninja Spence. And until next time, take a fat dad and give your
[38:52.180 --> 38:54.020]  mom a hug for me.
[39:04.720 --> 39:05.600]  We
[39:07.600 --> 39:09.600]  know.
[39:11.920 --> 39:17.280]  I just go with the trade wind blows, sending love to my friends and foes.
[39:26.640 --> 39:29.200]  I got the sunshine, rivers and trees.
[39:30.080 --> 39:30.560]  He's
[39:33.520 --> 39:35.520]  see how I just take the list.

[39:59.200 --> 40:02.200]  I just go where the trade wind blows
[40:02.200 --> 40:05.200]  Sending love to my friends and foes
[40:05.200 --> 40:08.200]  And I suppose I'm pleased
[40:08.200 --> 40:11.200]  To be chilling in the West Indies
[40:11.200 --> 40:14.200]  To provide all my wants and needs
[40:14.200 --> 40:17.200]  I got the sunshine, rivers and trees
[40:17.200 --> 40:19.200]  Green leaves, yeah

[40:22.200 --> 40:25.200]  Herb just a steam, pepper pot pon the stew
[40:25.200 --> 40:27.200]  Life is a dream if you got gratitude
[40:27.200 --> 40:31.200]  So God tell the regime dem can't stop what we do now
[40:31.200 --> 40:33.200]  Incarnation you think on your own
[40:33.200 --> 40:36.200]  Or else you're a slave to the things that you know
[40:36.200 --> 40:39.200]  What do you know if you learn everyday
[40:39.200 --> 40:42.200]  So be careful of things where you say

[40:49.200 --> 40:52.200]  Sending love to my friends and foes
[40:52.200 --> 40:55.200]  And I suppose I'm pleased
[40:55.200 --> 40:58.200]  To be chilling in the West Indies
[40:58.200 --> 41:01.200]  To provide all my wants and needs
[41:01.200 --> 41:04.200]  I got the sunshine, rivers and trees
[41:04.200 --> 41:06.200]  Green leaves, yeah
[41:06.200 --> 41:09.200]  Africa inna we soul but a Jah inna we heart
[41:09.200 --> 41:12.200]  It is of importance fi I and I gather
[41:12.200 --> 41:15.200]  If we cannot show now a balance that we had
[41:15.200 --> 41:18.200]  How do we propose then to carry it abroad
[41:18.200 --> 41:21.200]  Then a go to Ethiopia and you not have a plan
[41:21.200 --> 41:24.200]  The building of a nation a anna help her on
[41:24.200 --> 41:26.200]  One a lover, one a man is just a man
[41:26.200 --> 41:29.200]  It shall be a coronation when we land, land, land
[41:29.200 --> 41:33.200]  Who knows, who knows, who knows, who knows
[41:33.200 --> 41:36.200]  I just go where the trade wind blows
[41:36.200 --> 41:39.200]  Sending love to my friends and foes
[41:39.200 --> 41:42.200]  And I suppose I'm pleased
[41:42.200 --> 41:45.200]  To be chilling in the West Indies
[41:45.200 --> 41:48.200]  To provide all my wants and needs
[41:48.200 --> 41:51.200]  I got the sunshine, rivers and trees
[41:51.200 --> 41:53.200]  Green leaves, yeah
[41:54.200 --> 41:57.200]  And I say we just move now
[41:57.200 --> 41:59.200]  Yeah man
