[00:00.000 --> 00:05.400]  Welcome back, Podcast World. It's time for Episode 412 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:05.400 --> 00:09.060]  This episode is brought to you by our friends at Organ Elite Seeds. If you need new seeds
[00:09.060 --> 00:18.160]  in your garden, I highly recommend Organ Elite Seeds, and you can find them at www.organeliteseeds.com.
[00:18.160 --> 00:21.880]  It has become a tradition that we start the podcast off by talking about what I am dabbing.
[00:21.880 --> 00:26.520]  Today, I have got a nice buffet of extracts from our friends at Apothecary Farms in front
[00:26.520 --> 00:31.800]  of me. I think my go-to favorite has become this Tropicana Cookies Fambrosia jar. It started
[00:31.800 --> 00:38.420]  off as a four-gram jar. It is quickly depleting. The label says this is 72.4% THC with a total
[00:38.420 --> 00:44.000]  of 83, no, this is 85% total cannabinoids. This is a tasty concentrate. I really love
[00:44.000 --> 00:49.680]  the Tropicana Cookies. If I remember correctly, the Tropicana Cookies won the Dude Grows Cup
[00:49.680 --> 00:52.560]  last night. We will talk about that in just a minute.
[00:52.560 --> 00:55.960]  Before we get there, I owe a few people some shout-outs from Patreon. How about a big shout-out
[00:55.960 --> 01:00.360]  to my friend Squirrel Tactics? A huge shout-out to BAFSTA. Another giant grow from your heart
[01:00.360 --> 01:03.880]  shout-out to my friend Aldridge. How about a big giant shout-out to Eric Ross? And of
[01:03.880 --> 01:08.200]  course, another shout-out to Tanner Martinovic. Thank you guys for all of the continued Patreon
[01:08.200 --> 01:13.480]  support. If you'd like to learn how to become a patron, all you need to do is go to patreon.com

[01:18.680 --> 01:22.760]  I hope everybody caught the bonus episode that I put out on Friday. I put out an episode
[01:22.760 --> 01:27.760]  all about the Blue Raspberry Truffle strain, which I debuted at the Dude Grows show. So
[01:27.760 --> 01:31.760]  I hope everybody got to listen to that. Quite a few people mentioned they did listen. I
[01:31.760 --> 01:36.360]  got a great response to it. People seemed to like the way I described cannabis. So thanks
[01:36.360 --> 01:40.000]  for the support. Thanks for listening to the show. And thanks for the huge reaction at
[01:40.000 --> 01:45.360]  the Dude Grows Cup. A lot of people were really interested in the Blue Raspberry Truffle.
[01:45.360 --> 01:48.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, my Instagram is back. In the last few episodes, I've been crying
[01:48.520 --> 01:52.680]  and complaining like a little girl that my Instagram is gone. I sent a bunch of emails.
[01:52.680 --> 01:56.560]  I filled out a bunch of customer request forms, and I am back. I'm back on Instagram.
[01:56.560 --> 02:00.240]  I got my account going. They didn't remove anything. They cleaned out my inbox. So all
[02:00.240 --> 02:05.000]  my messages are gone, but all my posts are back. All my hashtags are back. I am back
[02:05.000 --> 02:09.800]  in action on Instagram. If you're not already following me on Instagram, I highly encourage
[02:09.800 --> 02:14.760]  you to give me a follow on Instagram. I use irie underscore genetics as my company name.
[02:14.760 --> 02:18.760]  I post a lot of great cannabis photography. I do live feed. They go talk about cannabis
[02:18.760 --> 02:22.880]  growing. I talk about cannabis culture. If you come into my live feed and ask a cannabis
[02:22.880 --> 02:26.280]  question, I will answer your question there in the live feed. It is a great time. I do
[02:26.280 --> 02:29.240]  encourage you to join me there.
[02:29.240 --> 02:31.720]  One more thing I want to talk about before we get to the Dude Grows Cup. That's when
[02:31.720 --> 02:35.060]  my voice is all burned out, by the way, you guys. I smoked a bunch of flour and a bunch
[02:35.060 --> 02:39.560]  of concentrates at the Dude Grows Cup. My voice sounds like poop. I apologize for that.
[02:39.560 --> 02:43.000]  But before we get there, I want to give a huge shout out to my friend Kelvin Medina.
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.840]  Kelvin is from Oklahoma. He was attending the Dude Grows Cup in Denver. On his way from
[02:47.920 --> 02:52.120]  Oklahoma, he stopped at the spot right here at the dab table and he took a couple of fat
[02:52.120 --> 02:57.120]  dabs. I promised Kelvin I was going to get him uncomfortably high. I'm pretty sure. Mission
[02:57.120 --> 03:00.640]  accomplished. Dude, Kelvin, thank you for stopping through. That was a great time. It
[03:00.640 --> 03:04.840]  is great meeting people that I've made friends with through the podcast, through social media.
[03:04.840 --> 03:07.920]  It's always a good time making new friends and meeting the people that I've been helping
[03:07.920 --> 03:11.740]  in their gardens. Man, thanks for coming through. Big shout out to Kelvin.
[03:11.740 --> 03:16.360]  Now let's talk about the Dude Grows Show. Let me tell you what the Dude Grows Show and
[03:16.360 --> 03:19.000]  the Dude Grows Cup. That's actually what we're going to talk about. Let me tell you
[03:19.000 --> 03:24.400]  what that is. The Dude Grows Show is a podcast. It's another growing podcast. I'm sure you've
[03:24.400 --> 03:28.040]  heard me mention that on the show. The Dude Grows Show is hosted by my friend, The Dude.
[03:28.040 --> 03:32.160]  It's co-hosted by a dude named Scotty Real. It is engineered by a guy known as The Grow
[03:32.160 --> 03:35.960]  Guru. They've got quite a few guys behind the scenes. Big shout out to all of them.
[03:35.960 --> 03:39.640]  It is a great podcast. They have developed a great community. The community is known
[03:39.640 --> 03:45.120]  as The Dude Grows Crew. Our friend, The Dude, and Scotty put together a great event. That
[03:45.160 --> 03:49.640]  event was last night at Cultivated Synergy in Denver. I think this was the fifth event.
[03:49.640 --> 03:53.360]  If I am correct, I am often wrong on things like that. It was at least the third Dude
[03:53.360 --> 03:59.040]  Grows Cup. Anyhow, they threw the Dude Grows Cup at Cultivated Synergy. It's designed to
[03:59.040 --> 04:04.240]  be a community event. The highlight of the event is a grow-off. People are invited to
[04:04.240 --> 04:09.360]  enter their grow into the competition. Then there is a blind taste test. Everybody who
[04:09.360 --> 04:13.600]  enters, everybody who attends the event is considered a judge. You are given tokens.
[04:14.320 --> 04:19.280]  You are offered a one-hitter pipe as you walk in. You're allowed to sample all of the entries.
[04:19.280 --> 04:23.920]  So they've got a little bud bar. All the entries are numbered. You get to sample those.
[04:23.920 --> 04:27.440]  Then when you find an entry that you deserve your vote, you put your little tokens in the
[04:27.440 --> 04:32.880]  corresponding jar and you say, that is the one I vote for. There were over 35 entries.
[04:32.880 --> 04:36.720]  There were approximately 40. I don't remember exactly how many. At the day of recording,
[04:36.720 --> 04:40.320]  I don't have that info available. The Dude and Scotty haven't posted that. I'm sure they will
[04:40.320 --> 04:46.480]  post all of those details very soon. However, a lot of people got to smoke approximately 50
[04:46.480 --> 04:50.800]  entries of cannabis. I did not get to sample anything. I had a booth. I was at my booth all
[04:50.800 --> 04:55.120]  evening. I got to smoke the concentrates I brought. Plenty of friends brought me plenty
[04:55.120 --> 04:58.640]  of great samples to enjoy and smoke. Big shout out to all my friends that brought me stuff to
[04:58.640 --> 05:03.280]  smoke. Let me stay on track here. The Dude Grows Cup. The Dude Grows Cup was a cool
[05:03.920 --> 05:08.880]  smoke-off, grow-off event thing. The event is aimed more to be a community get-together
[05:08.880 --> 05:12.560]  sort of a vibe. There are a lot of people, a lot of members in the Dude Grows crew.
[05:12.560 --> 05:16.320]  They want to meet up. We all talk online. We're all in the Facebook groups. We're all in the
[05:16.320 --> 05:20.000]  social media groups. We're all on Instagram talking. It's a good time to get together once
[05:20.000 --> 05:24.480]  a year and actually put some faces to all of those funny Instagram names and see who's posting those
[05:24.480 --> 05:29.120]  memes and see who's growing the dank. It's a good time to get together. It's like a family reunion.
[05:29.200 --> 05:34.240]  That's what the Dude Grows show is. It is a celebration of the podcast that is basically
[05:34.240 --> 05:38.400]  highlighted by a little grow competition, a friendly little grow competition.
[05:39.040 --> 05:42.720]  Let's talk about the day. The day was great. The drive up there was a little hectic.
[05:43.280 --> 05:48.080]  I had to travel I-25. Anybody that knows about I-25 knows how unpredictable that can be.
[05:48.080 --> 05:52.880]  It was a great drive until approximately Monument and then suddenly, snowstorm from hell. It was
[05:52.880 --> 05:56.800]  white, just white. You couldn't see the car in front of you. The windshield was caked in shit.
[05:56.800 --> 06:01.280]  It sucked for a few minutes. Then we got to Castle Rock. After Castle Rock, it was sunshiny again.
[06:01.280 --> 06:05.840]  It was like we were on two different planets for that drive. It was strange, but we made it. We got
[06:05.840 --> 06:09.920]  there. We got up to the Dude Grows show. It was an easy time to load in. Everybody there was super
[06:09.920 --> 06:15.280]  kind, super friendly, super polite. They helped us load in. We got set up super quickly. Then I
[06:15.280 --> 06:20.880]  met a few friends. I met a lot of friends there. A few of my friends were kind enough to enter some
[06:20.880 --> 06:27.360]  iRee genetics strains into the Dude Grows cup. I got to see and sample a few of those entries.
[06:27.360 --> 06:31.280]  Our friend Bruce brought me his entry. He let me see the Scarlet Begonias that he entered.
[06:31.280 --> 06:35.760]  Kelvin came up and he let me see the Donatello that he entered. It was really great to see the
[06:35.760 --> 06:40.160]  work that people are doing with the seeds that I am providing them. Great job to everybody who
[06:40.160 --> 06:45.440]  grew my genetics. Kelvin, you did a great job, dude. Kelvin brought some strawberry Starburst
[06:45.440 --> 06:50.800]  to my house and shared it with me. It wasn't quite dried and cured enough to be an entry for that
[06:50.800 --> 06:56.640]  cup, but it was an amazing product. It smelled like tangy plus oranges plus strawberries plus
[06:56.640 --> 07:02.320]  funk. It was really great. Kelvin actually had some of that flower pressed into a rosin press
[07:02.320 --> 07:07.440]  by our friend Pedro's Grow. If you don't know about Pedro, make sure you follow Pedro's Grow
[07:07.440 --> 07:12.800]  Room on YouTube. Give him a follow. He pressed some amazing rosin out of that strawberry Starburst.
[07:12.800 --> 07:17.760]  Let me say this here on the show. A lot of times, I talk a lot of shit about rosin. I am not a fan
[07:17.760 --> 07:24.080]  of rosin. Most of the time, it tastes like burnt popcorn. I cannot stand the flavor of a popsicle
[07:24.080 --> 07:30.320]  stick or when the doctor uses a wooden tongue depressor. It drives my body crazy. Something
[07:30.320 --> 07:34.960]  about the feeling of that wood on my tongue, it's making me shake and act weird right now just
[07:34.960 --> 07:40.320]  thinking about it. It gives me the chills. I do not like it. Something about rosin has that flavor.
[07:40.320 --> 07:45.520]  It tastes like a popsicle stick or burnt popcorn to me most of the time. When you're just taking
[07:45.520 --> 07:50.640]  raw flour and pressing it, it usually doesn't taste desirable in my opinion to my taste buds.
[07:50.640 --> 07:55.520]  That's just me. I'm not a hater on you and your rosin. What I'm getting to is this strawberry
[07:55.520 --> 08:02.240]  Starburst rosin that Kelvin grew and Pedro pressed was delicious. I would go back for another dab of
[08:02.240 --> 08:08.080]  that one right now. I owe a big shout out to, first of all, to Kelvin for growing that strawberry
[08:08.080 --> 08:13.440]  Starburst like a champion. That shit was perfect. He grew that sample that he gave me to perfection.
[08:13.440 --> 08:18.000]  Then also, I want to extend a huge shout out to Pedro for the marvelous job at squishing that
[08:18.000 --> 08:22.720]  product. Most of the time, like I said, I'm not impressed with the squish and that was delicious.
[08:22.720 --> 08:28.400]  Even Jaren from Five8 was loving it. Hey, Kelvin, I apologize that Jaren and myself pretty much
[08:28.400 --> 08:32.240]  smoked all of your strawberry Starburst concentrate while you watched, but that shit was delicious,
[08:32.240 --> 08:36.960]  dude. Thanks for sharing. Dude, you got a lot of great dabs. I hope you had as much fun as we did.
[08:36.960 --> 08:42.800]  Let's talk more about this Dude Grows Cup. I got to see so many of my friends. I got to meet so
[08:42.800 --> 08:48.240]  many people that I've never seen before that I've talked to online a lot. So many people were
[08:48.240 --> 08:54.160]  extremely, extremely generous. I was given many wonderful gifts. I've got a lot of seeds. I've
[08:54.160 --> 08:59.680]  got a lot of delicious flour. I've got a lot of amazing concentrate. One of my favorite gifts,
[08:59.680 --> 09:03.760]  and I hate to highlight anything because it makes somebody else feel lesser, but somebody gave me a
[09:03.760 --> 09:08.480]  street sign and it is Irie Genetics Boulevard or Irie Genetics Avenue. I don't have the sign here,
[09:08.480 --> 09:12.320]  but it looks just like the street signs on the corner. You got the stop sign, then right above
[09:12.320 --> 09:17.360]  it, it says the street. I've got one of those official street signs that says Irie Genetics.
[09:17.360 --> 09:21.120]  So now you are on my block. When you come onto my street, you are officially on
[09:21.120 --> 09:25.760]  Irie Genetics Boulevard or Irie Genetics Street. I thought that was a super cool gift. I was really
[09:25.760 --> 09:29.840]  excited to see that. A big thank you if you're listening to the show. That was my favorite gift
[09:29.840 --> 09:34.800]  of the weekend. Super awesome. I really enjoyed that. I got to meet a lot of great people. I keep
[09:34.800 --> 09:41.040]  mentioning that. I got to meet Stabby Stabberson in person finally. If anybody knows anything about
[09:41.040 --> 09:45.520]  Stabby, Stabby and I have been friends online for quite a while. I go on the Embracing Organic
[09:45.520 --> 09:49.760]  show and hang out with those guys. Stabby doesn't show his face. Stabby is one of those guys who
[09:49.760 --> 09:54.000]  would rather remain anonymous. He doesn't live in the most cannabis-friendly environment, so he
[09:54.000 --> 09:57.920]  needs to keep his face off of the internet. He can't be out there like I am and show his face
[09:57.920 --> 10:02.960]  and be a blabbermouth, so he stays in the shadows. It was an honor to finally meet my friend,
[10:02.960 --> 10:06.240]  Stabby McStabberson. What's up, dude? I hope you're listening to this. It was great to meet
[10:06.320 --> 10:12.640]  you, brother. It was also great to hang out with the rest of the Embracing Organics crew. I had a
[10:12.640 --> 10:16.560]  great time with those guys. They hung out at my booth for a few minutes. It was a really good
[10:16.560 --> 10:21.600]  time to see everybody. I took a really hilarious picture with Dirtman Dan. If you're following
[10:21.600 --> 10:26.800]  Dirtman Dan on Instagram, go check out the photo that I took with Dan. I think it is hilarious.
[10:26.800 --> 10:34.000]  Everybody calls Dan a hobbit or a troll because he's about 5'2". I am 6'5". I know I don't talk
[10:34.000 --> 10:38.000]  about that on the show. People often make comments when they see me. The first thing they say is,
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.640]  holy shit, you're tall. The second thing they say is, your dreads are crazy. Yes, I'm tall and I've
[10:42.640 --> 10:48.800]  got dreadlocks to my knees. Dirtman Dan is a gnome. He's basically a garden gnome when he
[10:48.800 --> 10:54.480]  stands next to me. When you put the 6'5 Rasta Jeff next to the 4'2 garden gnome, it was really
[10:54.480 --> 10:59.840]  a hilarious picture. That was a good time taking a photo with Dirtman Dan. It was a wonderful time
[10:59.840 --> 11:04.160]  seeing Jinxproof and Dung Beetle. What's up, guys? I see you at every event. It was great to
[11:04.160 --> 11:07.840]  hang out, get a chat with you. Big shout out to Miss Rose. I wish she would have been at the event
[11:07.840 --> 11:12.880]  also. It always is a pleasure to see that crew. I hung out with a lot of great people and I could
[11:12.880 --> 11:17.280]  run through a really long list of name dropping and shout outs of all these fun, great people
[11:17.280 --> 11:21.200]  that I got to hang out with and spend some time with. But I don't want to miss anybody. It feels
[11:21.200 --> 11:24.240]  worse when you leave somebody out. So I don't want to miss anybody. So just a big shout out to
[11:24.240 --> 11:29.680]  everybody who showed support and showed love at the Dude Grows Cup. If you were too shy or too
[11:29.680 --> 11:33.200]  intimidated to come say what's up, because everybody always emails me the next day. They're
[11:33.200 --> 11:37.040]  like, hey, I saw you. I was too intimidated to come say hi. You looked busy. Bro, that's what
[11:37.040 --> 11:41.040]  I'm there for. I want you to come say hi. Come shake my hand. If you were too shy this time,
[11:41.040 --> 11:45.040]  I'm just a normal person. I got stoned to shit. I had a good time just like you did. Come say
[11:45.040 --> 11:48.640]  what's up. Come shake my hand. But I want to give a huge shout out to everybody who showed me love,
[11:48.640 --> 11:52.800]  who showed me appreciation, who has shown the Grow From Your Heart podcast some love, who has
[11:52.800 --> 11:57.920]  shown just me personally some love, and of course, everybody who supports my other company, iRegenetics.
[11:57.920 --> 12:01.440]  I really appreciate all of the support from the entire cannabis community. You guys have
[12:01.440 --> 12:06.480]  really embraced me lately, and it has really made my life amazing. So thank you. I appreciate that.
[12:06.480 --> 12:11.280]  Then I want to extend an extra special shout out to everybody who was in my corner, so to speak.
[12:11.280 --> 12:15.200]  The iRegenetics booth was kind of tucked over into the corner. It ended up being kind of where
[12:15.200 --> 12:19.120]  the cool kids hung out, you guys. We were all just hanging out, taking dabs. Jesse Gross was over
[12:19.120 --> 12:23.040]  there. Stabby McStabberson was hanging out over there. Sean was over there. The beautiful Miss
[12:23.040 --> 12:27.760]  Amy was over there. It was a good time just having kind of the iRegenetics Grow From Your Heart sort
[12:28.160 --> 12:31.680]  subclick over there, just having our own little... It wasn't a private party, but we had our own
[12:31.680 --> 12:34.880]  little crew over there, and everybody was welcome to come hang out, and a lot of people did. Trust
[12:34.880 --> 12:38.320]  me, a lot of people came and went, but it was cool having everybody just hanging out in the corner.
[12:38.880 --> 12:42.560]  Jesse and Sean hung out in the corner for quite a while. Stabby McStabberson hung out for quite a
[12:42.560 --> 12:46.560]  while. Kelvin and Kike held it down for quite a while. They had some nice little space over by my
[12:46.560 --> 12:50.560]  booth. So it was really cool just to have the iRe Army and the Grow From Your Heart crew just
[12:50.560 --> 12:55.680]  showing love and showing support. And nobody would let me get anywhere near white-eyed.
[12:55.680 --> 12:59.200]  If my eyes started to get white, if I looked like I didn't have cotton mouth properly,
[12:59.200 --> 13:03.840]  somebody passed me a joint, somebody lit me up a dab. It was a great time. I had a bunch of fun.
[13:03.840 --> 13:08.880]  And if you can't tell by my voice, I smoked a ton of product yesterday. And I want to give a
[13:08.880 --> 13:13.840]  shout out to everybody. The product is improving. Your guys' flowers are getting better. The
[13:13.840 --> 13:18.240]  concentrates are getting better. When I used to go to events, people would pull out their
[13:18.240 --> 13:21.200]  concentrates and they'd be like, hey, dude, look what I brought. Would you like to take a dab of
[13:21.200 --> 13:25.280]  this? And I would be backpedaling, trying to figure out how am I going to tell this guy I
[13:25.280 --> 13:30.560]  don't want to dab his concentrate because that looks like fucking motor oil or some kind of poop
[13:30.560 --> 13:34.400]  soup is what we used to call it. And I really don't want to either put that in my banger because
[13:34.400 --> 13:37.840]  that's going to ruin my nail and make my nail taste like shit for the rest of the event.
[13:37.840 --> 13:40.800]  Also, I don't want to dab that. It's going to burn my throat and it's going to make my
[13:40.800 --> 13:43.920]  lungs taste like shit. And also the high from that is just going to give me a headache.
[13:43.920 --> 13:46.880]  So back in the day, I would be trying to figure out how to politely tell my friends,
[13:46.880 --> 13:50.960]  hey, I don't really want to smoke your concentrate. And I found out that the best way to do it is to
[13:50.960 --> 13:53.920]  just kind of be like, oh man, that looks delicious. Have you tried this? And then I
[13:53.920 --> 13:57.200]  pull out my concentrates and I give them a dab of that. And then I take a dab and then they kind
[13:57.200 --> 14:00.800]  of forget that they offered me a dab. And then that's usually my way to shake that off.
[14:00.800 --> 14:05.920]  However, I did not have to do that at this event. Every dab that was offered to me was acceptable
[14:05.920 --> 14:11.920]  and I smoked it. Also, every flower that was offered to me, I smoked it and I enjoyed it.
[14:11.920 --> 14:16.400]  I did not smoke any blunts. If you had something rolled in a blunt wrap or a blunt, I did decline
[14:16.400 --> 14:21.360]  on that. My voice and my throat took enough of a beating at that show. I did not really need to add
[14:21.360 --> 14:26.160]  the tobacco blunt wrap to that. And I do not enjoy a blunt wrap at all, honestly.
[14:26.160 --> 14:31.040]  I feel like we put a lot of time and a lot of work and a lot of energy into growing the finest
[14:31.040 --> 14:36.800]  cannabis we can grow. We do a lot of selections. We select for flavor, for aroma, for production,
[14:36.800 --> 14:41.600]  trichomes, and then we wrap it up. And basically what tastes to me, kind of like a toilet paper
[14:41.600 --> 14:45.680]  tube, you're just wrapping it up in a cardboard tube with that blunt wrap and I do not approve.
[14:45.680 --> 14:49.440]  I'm not hating on you if that's what you're doing. Do it if that's your thing, but I'm just not going
[14:49.440 --> 14:54.160]  to hit it when you try to pass it to me. But I was quite impressed with most of the product that
[14:54.160 --> 14:58.720]  I saw at the Dude Grows Cup this year. I saw some product from out of state. It was quite impressive
[14:58.720 --> 15:04.080]  also. There are people in illegal states that are really killing it with their grows. And I feel
[15:04.080 --> 15:09.040]  like here in Colorado, we're kind of cheating. I can drive to the growth store. I can tell the guy,
[15:09.040 --> 15:12.400]  hey, I want this and this. And he puts it on the counter and I pay cash for it. And I put it in
[15:12.400 --> 15:17.040]  my car and I drove home or I drive home. And then I use that on my cannabis plants that I can talk
[15:17.040 --> 15:22.240]  about having. There are six plants legally. It's not a big deal. Everybody's got fucking six plants.
[15:22.240 --> 15:28.480]  There are people in Ohio. There are people in Kentucky. There are people in every single state
[15:28.480 --> 15:34.640]  that showed up at the Dude Grows Cup with quality product and they make us look like we're cheating.
[15:34.640 --> 15:38.560]  Yeah, you can go to the growth store and get all the shit real easily here. That guy in Ohio,
[15:38.560 --> 15:43.360]  he's got to drive to his friend's house and park his car in the garage. Then they pull the friend's
[15:43.360 --> 15:47.680]  car out of the garage. They drive to the growth store in that car. They discreetly do their
[15:47.680 --> 15:51.280]  shopping. They don't talk to anybody in there. If somebody approaches you in the growth store,
[15:51.280 --> 15:55.280]  you leave in those sort of states. You don't want to get noticed, recognized. You don't want to be
[15:55.280 --> 15:59.840]  there. You go in, you get what you need. You put it on the counter. You pay cash. You get out.
[15:59.840 --> 16:04.160]  You drive that car around the block a bunch of times. Then you drive around other blocks a bunch
[16:04.160 --> 16:10.800]  of times just to throw off your trail. Yes, you need to be extra paranoid in a non-friendly state.
[16:10.800 --> 16:14.400]  So then they drive around. They go back to the friend's house, park the car in the garage,
[16:14.400 --> 16:19.520]  transfer the newly purchased grow equipment from friend's car to your car. Then you drive your car
[16:19.520 --> 16:24.160]  around the block a few times. Drive the really long way home. Drive around your block a couple
[16:24.160 --> 16:28.240]  of times to make sure there are no strange cars in the driveway or no strange cars on the block.
[16:28.240 --> 16:32.800]  Pull into the garage, unload your shit really discreetly in the night. Build your grow room
[16:32.800 --> 16:36.800]  when nobody can hear it, nobody can see it. It's a really different thing when you're in a
[16:36.800 --> 16:42.080]  non-friendly state. You guys, in your friendly states in Colorado and California, Washington,
[16:42.080 --> 16:46.240]  Oregon, anywhere you've got grow-friendly laws, we are basically cheating when it comes to
[16:46.240 --> 16:51.920]  entering a grow competition. We are a step ahead. It's so much easier. We're handicapping everybody
[16:51.920 --> 16:58.480]  else because we can do it. We don't have to hide it. Having to do it under stealth mode is a whole
[16:58.480 --> 17:02.560]  extra challenge that we don't have to think about. So keep that in mind, you guys. Don't take it for
[17:02.560 --> 17:06.640]  granted if you are in a legal state. All right. I feel like I've mentioned a bunch of names and
[17:06.640 --> 17:10.560]  done a bunch of name dropping and given a bunch of thanks and a bunch of shout outs, but I haven't
[17:10.560 --> 17:15.120]  gotten to the people that deserve the largest shout outs of the evening. Of course, that would
[17:15.120 --> 17:20.080]  be my friend, The Dude. The Dude, thanks for a great party. Of course, that includes Scotty Real.
[17:20.080 --> 17:24.320]  Thanks for a great party, Dude. Thanks for the invite. Thanks again for having me on The Dude
[17:24.320 --> 17:29.440]  Grows podcast. Being on The Dude Grows podcast really exposed me to a larger audience. I've
[17:29.440 --> 17:34.640]  gotten a lot of reactions via my email channel, via my social media, and through my emails. A lot
[17:34.640 --> 17:39.040]  of people really noticed me there. So I owe those guys a big thank you. Thanks for having me on the
[17:39.040 --> 17:43.680]  show. Thanks for a great party. Also, a big shout out to Guru. Dude, I saw you busting ass all night.
[17:43.680 --> 17:48.000]  You were staying busy. You didn't get to party. You were working. So I do appreciate that. Everybody
[17:48.000 --> 17:52.160]  else was having fun. Guru was running in circles, making sure everything was working smoothly.
[17:52.160 --> 17:55.200]  So was Scotty and The Dude. But toward the end of the night, they got to chill out and have a good
[17:55.200 --> 17:58.720]  time. It was fun watching everybody just run around in circles and get it going. So I'm
[17:58.720 --> 18:02.640]  proud of those guys. Big thanks for the invite. Big thanks for the great party. Big thanks for
[18:02.640 --> 18:07.920]  the dedication and for what you're doing for the community. Those guys do a lot for the cannabis
[18:07.920 --> 18:12.560]  community, a lot for growers, a lot for smokers, and a lot for the movement. And I truly appreciate
[18:12.560 --> 18:17.760]  it. So big shout out to those folks. Also, a big shout out to JR Token. JR Token works behind the
[18:17.760 --> 18:22.640]  scenes with the DGC crew. He does a lot of work. We've communicated a lot. And I appreciate that,
[18:22.640 --> 18:27.920]  Dude. So I owe him a big shout out. You guys, I can't wait for The Dude Grows Cup next year.
[18:27.920 --> 18:34.080]  It is almost time, almost time to start looking for a larger venue. The place was just perfectly
[18:34.080 --> 18:39.440]  full. I think it sells out at 350. I think there were 349 people there. I didn't count. I'm just
[18:39.440 --> 18:44.400]  saying it was perfectly full. It was beautifully set up. I really enjoyed the event this year.
[18:44.400 --> 18:48.000]  Every year, it gets a little bit better. This year, in my opinion, it was damn near perfect.
[18:48.000 --> 18:52.400]  There aren't many things I would change. I had a really great time. So I look forward to seeing
[18:52.400 --> 18:57.040]  you next year. If you did not make it to The Dude Grows Cup this year, do what you can to make it
[18:57.040 --> 19:01.440]  next year because it is a party. It is a good time. It is a great community event. There were
[19:01.440 --> 19:06.560]  lots of great growers, smokers, and community members there. At one point, hanging out at my
[19:06.560 --> 19:13.120]  booth, it was myself, Aquaponic Steve, Jinxproof, and Scotty Real. So it was a podcasting VIP
[19:13.120 --> 19:18.160]  sort of cannabis community hangout right there at my booth. So come meet all the cool cannabis
[19:18.160 --> 19:22.800]  people. Oh, and Jaren was hanging out quite a bit. That's a funny story. During the award ceremony,
[19:22.800 --> 19:27.440]  Jaren from Five8, New Millennium Nutrients, decided to stop by my booth and hang out.
[19:27.440 --> 19:34.720]  And he was taking a dab of Kelvin's Strawberry Starburst Rosin that was pressed by Pedro.
[19:34.720 --> 19:38.480]  It was hard for me to say Strawberry Starburst Rosin. My brain didn't want to go down that path.
[19:38.480 --> 19:42.880]  He was actually taking a dab of it when it was announced that he won an award for his grow. I
[19:42.880 --> 19:47.040]  think he took third place for his entry. It was funny that he was taking a dab right at the time.
[19:47.040 --> 19:49.840]  I was like, hey, you got something to do, bro. You're going to have to set that down. It was
[19:49.920 --> 19:53.280]  just really funny, really casual. But if you're into the cannabis industry,
[19:53.280 --> 19:56.720]  if you were into the people who are on podcasts, if you're into all of that stuff, I think you
[19:56.720 --> 20:00.560]  would have a great time at the Dude Grows show. And if we got to hang out this year,
[20:00.560 --> 20:04.240]  and if I didn't give you a shout out, if your name didn't get mentioned, don't take it personally.
[20:04.240 --> 20:08.000]  I don't want to leave anybody out. I know I mentioned a lot of people. There are hundreds
[20:08.000 --> 20:12.640]  more people I could mention. Big shout out to everybody who hung out over in the Iry Genetics
[20:12.640 --> 20:16.960]  corner. Big shout out to everybody who gave me some support. I hope that covers everybody.
[20:16.960 --> 20:20.640]  Big shout out to everybody that hears this. How's that? I got big love for the whole cannabis
[20:20.640 --> 20:24.960]  community. So big thanks to everybody. The number one question that I was asked, well,
[20:24.960 --> 20:28.720]  the number two and three question, I guess number one is how tall are you? And number two is how
[20:28.720 --> 20:31.920]  long are your dreads, which is really weird. It's a cannabis event. Come on, let's ask about
[20:31.920 --> 20:37.040]  weed stuff. The number three question that I got asked at this event was, do you have any
[20:37.040 --> 20:42.480]  feminized seeds? Unfortunately, my answer was repeatedly, no, I do not have any fem seeds,
[20:42.480 --> 20:48.640]  regular seeds only at this event. However, in approximately 70-ish days, those are breeder
[20:48.640 --> 20:54.160]  terms, approximately 70 days, I should have feminized seeds available. They will be available
[20:54.160 --> 20:58.640]  through Oregon Elite Seeds. So if you're looking for Iry Genetics feminized seeds, they will be
[20:58.640 --> 21:02.880]  back. I will have Lemon Jeffrey available. I will have the Golden Goat feminized available.
[21:02.880 --> 21:07.760]  We will be dropping the first batch of the Orange Gasm to hit the public through Oregon Elite Seeds.
[21:08.400 --> 21:12.800]  Those are approximately two weeks into flower. Now, they need quite a bit more time to get going,
[21:12.800 --> 21:18.880]  but check back in about 60, maybe 70 days, and we will have some feminized seeds available.
[21:19.600 --> 21:25.680]  I also was approached by another distributor. So in a very soon to come episode, I am excited
[21:25.680 --> 21:30.720]  to announce that I should have been picked up by another very large distributor. Most of you have
[21:30.720 --> 21:34.000]  already caught on to who I'm talking about. If you're a seed buyer and a seed shopper,
[21:34.000 --> 21:38.480]  I'm excited to make that announcement here on a very soon to come episode of the Grow From Your
[21:38.480 --> 21:42.560]  Heart podcast. Ladies and gentlemen, my voice is burning out. I think that is all I've got
[21:42.560 --> 21:47.040]  for you for this episode. I would like your feedback on something. A few episodes back,
[21:47.040 --> 21:54.000]  I asked, what does 420 mean to you? 420 is quickly approaching. I want to know what 420 means to you.
[21:54.000 --> 21:58.400]  The first time I asked it, somebody sent me a message. They said, do you mean 420 the time,
[21:58.400 --> 22:03.840]  420 the day, or 420 the number? I want to know what it means to you. Does it mean the time? Does
[22:03.840 --> 22:08.160]  it mean the number? Does it mean the day? What does it mean to you? What does 420 mean to you?
[22:08.160 --> 22:12.080]  Send me an email. My email address is growfromyourheart at hotmail.com,
