[01:46.880 --> 01:51.120]  and imbibe and partake in the iRedirect holiday sale.
[01:51.120 --> 01:52.120]  Thank you.
[01:52.120 --> 01:53.120]  That sale was a great success.
[01:53.120 --> 01:54.780]  It would not have happened without you.
[01:54.780 --> 02:00.600]  So big shout out to everybody who did participate in the holiday sale.
[02:00.600 --> 02:02.320]  I hope you had a great safe new year.
[02:02.320 --> 02:05.080]  I hope the holiday you chose to celebrate was great for you.
[02:05.080 --> 02:07.240]  I'm not concerned with which holiday you celebrate.
[02:07.240 --> 02:10.760]  I just hope you did celebrate one with your friends, your family, hopefully some good
[02:10.760 --> 02:11.800]  food.
[02:11.800 --> 02:15.060]  Hopefully you got to smoke something good with somebody strange, maybe a weird cousin
[02:15.060 --> 02:16.920]  or an uncle you never smoked with.
[02:16.920 --> 02:17.920]  Hope you got to do that.
[02:17.920 --> 02:21.400]  Maybe that smoke a joint before a walk kind of thing with a family member.
[02:21.400 --> 02:24.840]  Hope you got to participate in some of that action and have a good holiday.
[02:24.840 --> 02:29.440]  I had a wonderful holiday, but when I got home from my holiday shenanigans, I went to
[02:29.440 --> 02:34.840]  my grow space and I stepped in a small puddle of water that was not supposed to be there.
[02:34.840 --> 02:35.840]  That's right.
[02:35.840 --> 02:39.440]  I had a drain back up in the area where my grow is and there was a bunch of water in
[02:39.440 --> 02:40.480]  that space.
[02:40.480 --> 02:44.200]  So I've spent a couple of days getting some water out, doing some cleanup, pulling up
[02:44.200 --> 02:46.680]  some carpet, still have a little bit of stuff to do.
[02:46.680 --> 02:50.400]  This podcast may be a little bit shorter than you're used to because there is more work
[02:50.400 --> 02:51.400]  to be done.
[02:51.400 --> 02:54.840]  I got to get some shit out of there, get some shit cleaned up, get myself nice and dirty
[02:54.840 --> 02:56.140]  and get back in action.
[02:56.140 --> 02:58.760]  But that is not the most important part we're talking about today.
[02:58.760 --> 03:03.360]  I want to know if you've got a plan, if you've got a strategy, what are the risks of shit
[03:03.360 --> 03:05.520]  going wrong near your grow?
[03:05.520 --> 03:10.880]  My grow, there was a flood and the water got a one inch from plants and the other way
[03:10.880 --> 03:12.720]  it got inches from a drum set.
[03:12.720 --> 03:15.200]  So it could have been much more disastrous than it was.
[03:15.200 --> 03:16.400]  It did cause a huge problem.
[03:16.400 --> 03:17.880]  It did cause a big mess.
[03:17.880 --> 03:20.760]  The only thing that really, really fucked up was my schedule.
[03:20.760 --> 03:24.960]  I've got to throw away some carpets and some small items and details, but most of the stuff
[03:24.960 --> 03:26.540]  will be recovered and repaired.
[03:26.540 --> 03:28.000]  But it really messed up my week.
[03:28.000 --> 03:30.160]  It's messing up my timing and my flow.
[03:30.160 --> 03:34.320]  Like I said, the podcast will be a little shorter here, but do you have a strategy?
[03:34.320 --> 03:38.600]  What if there's a water leak in your grow space or where you are growing or near there?
[03:38.600 --> 03:40.400]  Will that water make it to your grow?
[03:40.400 --> 03:41.920]  Are you prepared for something like that?
[03:41.920 --> 03:43.160]  Is there a floor drain?
[03:43.160 --> 03:45.480]  Has that floor drain been maintained?
[03:45.480 --> 03:46.480]  What's going on?
[03:46.480 --> 03:49.000]  Are you prepared for any sort of disaster in the grow?
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.960]  Like water has been kicking my ass the past couple of days.
[03:51.960 --> 03:53.400]  Are you prepared for water?
[03:53.400 --> 03:55.560]  Then of course there's the opposite side of that one.
[03:55.560 --> 03:56.560]  There is fire.
[03:56.560 --> 03:57.560]  Are you prepared for fire?
[03:57.560 --> 04:00.600]  So this is just my quick heads up.
[04:00.600 --> 04:01.600]  Check on your shit.
[04:01.600 --> 04:02.600]  Make sure all your drains are cool.
[04:02.600 --> 04:04.040]  Make sure no water's coming up anywhere.
[04:04.040 --> 04:05.480]  Make sure nothing's leaking.
[04:05.480 --> 04:07.640]  Make sure there's no sparks, no loose wires.
[04:07.640 --> 04:10.080]  Go ahead and do a quick inspection here at the start of the year.
[04:10.080 --> 04:13.800]  My friend John told me out of sight, out of mind, and that's kind of how I felt about
[04:13.800 --> 04:14.800]  the plumbing.
[04:14.800 --> 04:16.400]  That's kind of how we felt about the water.
[04:16.400 --> 04:19.040]  It wasn't a problem until it was a fucking problem.
[04:19.040 --> 04:23.800]  Luckily it didn't destroy anything too expensive, too crazy here, but it definitely slowed me
[04:23.800 --> 04:24.800]  down.
[04:24.800 --> 04:26.520]  That's enough talking about a flood, talking about that.
[04:26.520 --> 04:28.920]  I just want to know if you are prepared.
[04:28.920 --> 04:30.280]  What are you going to do if you get a flood?
[04:30.280 --> 04:31.520]  Do you have something lined up?
[04:31.840 --> 04:36.560]  If the flood does come, can you get the people down in your area to work on it without getting
[04:36.560 --> 04:37.660]  yourself in trouble?
[04:37.660 --> 04:39.080]  Maybe you're not in a legal place.
[04:39.080 --> 04:40.080]  I'm in a legal state.
[04:40.080 --> 04:43.080]  I've only got a few legal plants in that area where I'm growing.
[04:43.080 --> 04:46.160]  The plumber, the drain guy, everybody was able to go in there and they go, nice plants.
[04:46.160 --> 04:48.640]  And I was like, yeah, quit fucking looking at them just because they're over there in
[04:48.640 --> 04:50.160]  an area and they're cool and they can see them.
[04:50.160 --> 04:51.420]  It's not a big deal.
[04:51.420 --> 04:53.600]  Maybe you're in a place where you can't grow.
[04:53.600 --> 04:57.760]  Can you quickly hide that grow if some shit does go wrong in your, it's your home, your
[04:57.760 --> 05:00.640]  rental space, whatever you're doing where you got that grow.
[05:00.760 --> 05:03.400]  And you can seal that should you need to take some quick action.
[05:03.400 --> 05:04.560]  That is my question to you.
[05:04.560 --> 05:05.560]  All right.
[05:05.560 --> 05:06.560]  That's just a heads up.
[05:06.560 --> 05:07.560]  That's what's on my mind.
[05:07.560 --> 05:09.640]  I got some ruined shoes and some wet pants.
[05:09.640 --> 05:11.200]  It has not been fun.
[05:11.200 --> 05:15.120]  Let's move on to more fun stuff in this podcast.
[05:15.120 --> 05:17.640]  Recently my friend Mobius, Mobius, I love you, bro.
[05:17.640 --> 05:19.360]  I got nothing but love and respect for you.
[05:19.360 --> 05:21.680]  We've become really good friends over the couple of years.
[05:21.680 --> 05:24.520]  I simply disagree with the comment that you made on YouTube.
[05:24.520 --> 05:25.520]  We're still good friends, bro.
[05:25.520 --> 05:26.900]  I'll still smoke a fat joint with you.
[05:26.900 --> 05:29.520]  This is just a really good topic of conversation.
[05:29.520 --> 05:32.440]  So my friend Mobius left a comment on a YouTube video.
[05:32.440 --> 05:37.200]  I did a video about selecting males and reversals for breeding projects.
[05:37.200 --> 05:41.120]  I talked about just that, how I select male plants and how I select which plants I do
[05:41.120 --> 05:44.680]  want to reverse for my personal breeding projects.
[05:44.680 --> 05:49.320]  My friend Mobius, he chimed in with his comment and I fully respect this opinion.
[05:49.320 --> 05:51.600]  I just think this is great podcast material.
[05:51.600 --> 05:53.240]  This is so totally something we should address.
[05:53.240 --> 05:55.800]  I could talk about for a long time on a podcast.
[05:55.800 --> 05:58.200]  Like I said, I got nothing but love and respect for my dude.
[05:58.200 --> 05:59.320]  Mobius, don't get this twisted.
[05:59.320 --> 06:03.440]  All right, it says, I think another great thing to think about is if you are breeding
[06:03.440 --> 06:09.280]  to sell rec and med to rec and med growers and be a seed company, don't get too stuck
[06:09.280 --> 06:10.840]  on what you like.
[06:10.840 --> 06:14.240]  And I kind of touched on this before, but we're going to elaborate here.
[06:14.240 --> 06:17.240]  It says, instead, try to make a diverse menu.
[06:17.240 --> 06:18.560]  Think flavors and effects.
[06:18.560 --> 06:25.100]  Have fruit, have gas, have garlic, have mint, have earth, but also have soaring highs along
[06:25.100 --> 06:27.280]  with pile driver heavy stuff.
[06:27.360 --> 06:34.080]  Bottom line is be diverse, not only thinking about rec market, but medical market as well.
[06:34.080 --> 06:35.560]  That is very good feedback.
[06:35.560 --> 06:38.960]  I like that, but I also disagree with that.
[06:38.960 --> 06:40.840]  I respectfully disagree with that.
[06:40.840 --> 06:46.480]  As a breeder, as the person making the seeds, I don't think about the recreational or the
[06:46.480 --> 06:52.120]  medical market at all when I'm making a cross.
[06:52.280 --> 06:57.520]  Selfishly, I'm thinking about what I like in cannabis when I'm making a cross.
[06:57.520 --> 07:04.080]  I don't think that, and I'm not going to, this will sound egotistical, but if you took
[07:04.080 --> 07:09.360]  Van Gogh and told Van Gogh, make some art that the people will like, the people aren't
[07:09.360 --> 07:12.600]  going to like the art that Van Gogh makes, but if you shut the fuck up and leave Van
[07:12.600 --> 07:16.400]  Gogh alone and let Van Gogh paint, shit's going to come out amazing.
[07:16.400 --> 07:21.560]  I'm not saying that I'm an artist or a painter or anything like that, but I breed what I
[07:22.000 --> 07:27.440]  like and it just happens that I like plants with certain turf profiles and certain buzz
[07:27.440 --> 07:34.080]  types and certain growth structures, and those plants also are desirable to the general public,
[07:34.080 --> 07:38.600]  the people that want to grow my followers, my fans, my supporters, the iRee army, the
[07:38.600 --> 07:41.120]  people that want to grow iRee genetic seeds.
[07:41.120 --> 07:45.880]  You guys happen to like those because I'm growing it with passion, with love for what
[07:45.880 --> 07:48.160]  I like to do.
[07:48.160 --> 07:50.440]  I got a couple of ways I like to describe this.
[07:50.440 --> 07:52.600]  There's an artist called Matis Yahu.
[07:52.600 --> 07:56.480]  He came up a couple of years ago in the early 2000s, 2005-ish.
[07:56.480 --> 07:57.760]  The dude was hot, hot shit.
[07:57.760 --> 08:03.440]  His first album, first two albums were amazing, but you could tell that he had spent his entire
[08:03.440 --> 08:07.960]  life putting those two albums together and it was everything he had to put that together.
[08:07.960 --> 08:11.640]  It was all of his creativity from when he had started writing up to the time when those
[08:11.640 --> 08:12.760]  albums were put out.
[08:12.760 --> 08:14.920]  That was everything he had.
[08:14.920 --> 08:16.240]  That was his art.
[08:16.240 --> 08:18.160]  Those albums are fucking awesome.
[08:18.160 --> 08:21.240]  Those are two of my most favorite albums, Shake Off the Dust to Rise and of course Live
[08:21.240 --> 08:22.240]  at Stubbs.
[08:22.240 --> 08:24.800]  There might be more stuff before that, but those are the two when he got popular.
[08:24.800 --> 08:27.240]  That's like his life's work right there.
[08:27.240 --> 08:28.840]  That's what really got him going.
[08:28.840 --> 08:29.840]  He went on tour.
[08:29.840 --> 08:30.840]  He got super known.
[08:30.840 --> 08:31.840]  He got super famous.
[08:31.840 --> 08:34.400]  He was killing it because his art came from his heart.
[08:34.400 --> 08:37.200]  It was his connection with his music, what he did.
[08:37.200 --> 08:41.120]  He didn't do it for anybody but himself, so it was fucking awesome.
[08:41.120 --> 08:44.800]  After that, the record label came and said, hey bro, it's time for that second record.
[08:44.800 --> 08:46.800]  You got to put some shit out.
[08:46.800 --> 08:47.800]  Guess what?
[08:48.440 --> 08:49.440]  It kind of bites a dick.
[08:49.440 --> 08:52.040]  That second record, no offense Modest Yahoo, you know what I'm saying though brother.
[08:52.040 --> 08:55.960]  That next record just was not what we expected, what we had hoped for.
[08:55.960 --> 08:57.040]  It sounded bubblegummy.
[08:57.040 --> 08:58.360]  It sounded way overproduced.
[08:58.360 --> 09:03.680]  It sounded like a record company took over and demanded a record on a timeline.
[09:03.680 --> 09:07.560]  Part of my point to that is I'm not doing records for a record company.
[09:07.560 --> 09:09.320]  I'm making records for myself.
[09:09.320 --> 09:11.240]  I'm making sounds that I think sound good.
[09:11.240 --> 09:16.080]  I'm making turps and strains and crosses that I think sound good.
[09:16.080 --> 09:18.240]  Another way that I like to think about it is I'm a musician.
[09:18.240 --> 09:20.440]  I can read, write, I can play any kind of music.
[09:20.440 --> 09:24.320]  That's why a lot of things I talk about, I go back to music and it's always relatable
[09:24.320 --> 09:25.320]  for me.
[09:25.320 --> 09:26.320]  I'm a musician.
[09:26.320 --> 09:27.840]  Like I said a moment ago, I can read music.
[09:27.840 --> 09:28.840]  I can write music.
[09:28.840 --> 09:31.600]  I have a deep understanding of the way music works.
[09:31.600 --> 09:34.120]  Not just, I'm the drummer, but not just in the drums.
[09:34.120 --> 09:36.680]  I understand the way the time works, the way the dynamics work.
[09:36.680 --> 09:37.840]  I've been on stage.
[09:37.840 --> 09:40.480]  I know how to make the singer sound good by playing a certain way.
[09:40.480 --> 09:42.480]  I know how to make the bass player sound better.
[09:42.480 --> 09:46.280]  I know how to make the beat feel a little faster even though it isn't just by playing
[09:46.280 --> 09:49.000]  in front of or behind the beat just a little bit.
[09:49.000 --> 09:51.160]  I have a deep understanding of music.
[09:51.160 --> 09:53.600]  I can play any kind of music that you want me to.
[09:53.600 --> 09:55.920]  I like to play funky music.
[09:55.920 --> 09:57.280]  I like to get down and funky.
[09:57.280 --> 09:58.880]  Of course, I love to play reggae music.
[09:58.880 --> 10:01.420]  I love to jam and get improvisational.
[10:01.420 --> 10:07.000]  It all sounds really good, but if you made me play country, it would sound okay, but
[10:07.000 --> 10:09.640]  it wouldn't sound like country music from the heart.
[10:09.640 --> 10:11.760]  It wouldn't have that country music.
[10:11.760 --> 10:15.720]  It would be country music, but it wouldn't be country music.
[10:15.720 --> 10:18.120]  For country music, you need something right in there.
[10:18.120 --> 10:19.120]  That's my opinion.
[10:19.120 --> 10:21.120]  If you want it to sound country music, you got to have some.
[10:21.120 --> 10:22.560]  I don't have country in my heart at all.
[10:22.560 --> 10:23.560]  I'm not a country boy.
[10:23.560 --> 10:24.560]  I'm a fucking city boy.
[10:24.560 --> 10:27.280]  I got dreadlocks and I wear sneakers and shit.
[10:27.280 --> 10:29.600]  I don't got no boots or a hat, so I don't have that country feel.
[10:29.600 --> 10:31.840]  I could play the blues because I've had the fucking blues before.
[10:31.840 --> 10:35.480]  Anyway, if you told me to put out a country album, it would be terrible because I don't
[10:35.480 --> 10:36.480]  care.
[10:36.480 --> 10:38.160]  It's not going to have any heart, any soul.
[10:38.160 --> 10:43.040]  What I'm doing is maybe it's selfish of me, but I'm breeding for what I really like.
[10:43.040 --> 10:45.040]  I have access to a lot of plants.
[10:45.040 --> 10:47.280]  You guys know that I've worked in commercial facilities.
[10:47.280 --> 10:48.400]  I've got friends that grow.
[10:48.400 --> 10:49.600]  I've got friends that breed.
[10:49.600 --> 10:54.380]  I'm in grows all the time, helping people out, looking at things, inspecting, investigating.
[10:54.380 --> 10:56.600]  Sometimes I see a plant and I go, what's that one, bro?
[10:56.600 --> 10:57.880]  They'll tell me, they'll go, that's this.
[10:57.880 --> 10:59.800]  I go, I'm going to need a cut of that.
[10:59.800 --> 11:00.800]  They'll go, well, okay.
[11:00.800 --> 11:03.920]  I'll tell them, you owe me this much money for coming here today.
[11:03.920 --> 11:06.320]  Instead of paying me, I want a cut of that.
[11:06.320 --> 11:09.440]  They'll go, okay, because people would definitely rather give you a plant than money most of
[11:09.440 --> 11:10.440]  the time.
[11:10.440 --> 11:11.720]  I get a lot of cool cuts and shit.
[11:11.720 --> 11:15.740]  People send me and give me and share with me really cool cuts.
[11:15.740 --> 11:18.480]  Sometimes I'll just see something and I'll be like, that girl right there needs to be
[11:18.480 --> 11:24.080]  pollinated by either the Jack the Ripper male or the BC Lemon Skunk male or possibly King
[11:24.080 --> 11:25.600]  Solomon.
[11:25.600 --> 11:27.300]  Everybody's going to get pollinated by Solomon.
[11:27.300 --> 11:31.440]  Before the end of this, it'll be Solomon to everybody before the end.
[11:31.440 --> 11:35.440]  I just see the plants and I go, man, that one right there and that one right there.
[11:35.560 --> 11:39.560]  It's like just giving me modeling clay or sculpting clay or I don't know shit about
[11:39.560 --> 11:43.200]  sculpting so that was a bad example, but it's like giving me a big thing of paints and a
[11:43.200 --> 11:46.340]  paintbrush and a fresh canvas and just letting me go.
[11:46.340 --> 11:51.560]  If you told me, breed this, I'd go, I don't know if I want to do that.
[11:51.560 --> 11:52.560]  Why am I doing that?
[11:52.560 --> 11:57.200]  I need to smoke a plant or look at a plant or be in the room with the plant and the plant
[11:57.200 --> 12:01.520]  will say, hey, hey bro, and maybe this is fucking crazy, but I can hear it.
[12:01.520 --> 12:05.320]  The plant goes, you should definitely breed me to the Jack the Ripper male.
[12:05.320 --> 12:10.280]  I would make a fucking fire and I go, huh, I should probably breed this strawberry starburst
[12:10.280 --> 12:14.320]  plant to the Jack the Ripper male and then I do it and most of the time it's fucking
[12:14.320 --> 12:15.320]  awesome.
[12:15.320 --> 12:21.400]  So Mobius, I do like your idea of having the diverse catalog and keeping medical and recreational
[12:21.400 --> 12:26.200]  markets in mind and that that's another thing we could fucking talk on, but I do like that
[12:26.200 --> 12:29.680]  idea, but that is not, uh, that is not my style.
[12:29.680 --> 12:30.840]  I don't think that would work for me.
[12:31.160 --> 12:34.920]  I think me sticking with doing what I like has been working pretty well and it would
[12:34.920 --> 12:38.840]  be fake and it would be, uh, I wouldn't be growing from my heart, breeding with love,
[12:38.840 --> 12:39.840]  which is my motto.
[12:39.840 --> 12:41.320]  That's what it's all about for me.
[12:41.320 --> 12:46.080]  That would be, that would, that's one step too close to breeding with my wallet.
[12:46.080 --> 12:50.560]  I'm not thinking about my wallet and my pocketbook and shit when I'm breeding, but also I like
[12:50.560 --> 12:54.240]  the fact that you said, keep the patients, the medical and the recreational users in
[12:54.240 --> 12:55.240]  mind.
[12:55.240 --> 12:56.240]  That is a great thing.
[12:56.240 --> 13:00.080]  Um, the way that I see that I'm going to go right back to music and I've used this
[13:00.120 --> 13:01.120]  before.
[13:01.120 --> 13:06.360]  Um, Mobius is in, I know my dude Mobius, you listen to heavier music than I do.
[13:06.360 --> 13:08.600]  I listened to a fish and reggae and stuff like that.
[13:08.600 --> 13:12.840]  I think I got Mobius into fish cause Trey is a fucking maniac, but we listened to different
[13:12.840 --> 13:13.840]  shit.
[13:13.840 --> 13:16.640]  So the way I describe it is, uh, some people want to listen to reggae.
[13:16.640 --> 13:19.640]  If you want to listen to reggae, that's IRI genetic seed company.
[13:19.640 --> 13:23.800]  If you want to correlate music to seed brands, if you want to listen to reggae, that's fucking
[13:23.800 --> 13:25.840]  I'm, that is me right over here.
[13:25.840 --> 13:29.880]  If you want to listen to, um, I don't even have other breeders to compare it to fucking
[13:30.680 --> 13:32.400]  I should have not gone down that route.
[13:32.400 --> 13:35.720]  If you want to do some gangster rap shit, we all know that Masonic is the dude for the
[13:35.720 --> 13:37.400]  Compton gangster rap kind of vibe.
[13:37.400 --> 13:41.560]  So if that's what you want, what I'm saying is if you want to diversify the grow instead
[13:41.560 --> 13:45.720]  of expecting one breeder to offer everything, that's when you got to go to different breeders.
[13:45.720 --> 13:50.080]  Like I know that if I want like some cushy stuff that I could go to DNA genetics and
[13:50.080 --> 13:51.980]  those guys have all that cushy shit.
[13:51.980 --> 13:55.160]  If I want a Wilson cross, I'm definitely going to go talk to Masonic smoker.
[13:55.160 --> 13:59.280]  Uh, if I want some Jilly bean stuff, I'm going to go talk to my friend, miss Jill.
[13:59.280 --> 14:03.840]  If I want some, uh, some of that grandpa's cookies or ethos cookies, I got to go talk
[14:03.840 --> 14:04.840]  to my dude, Colin.
[14:04.840 --> 14:08.600]  Uh, if I want heavy duty fruity, which is in the garden right now and bangs out, I'd
[14:08.600 --> 14:09.960]  go talk to Adam done.
[14:09.960 --> 14:11.960]  Uh, that is TH seeds.
[14:11.960 --> 14:16.600]  So you just got to, instead of, uh, having one expecting one breeder to diversify the
[14:16.600 --> 14:19.920]  growth for you, that's when I recommend, and I know you're doing this, Mobius, you've got
[14:19.920 --> 14:23.120]  seeds from a lot of different breeders and you kill it with all of them.
[14:23.120 --> 14:26.880]  And that helps you have a variety, a little bit of difference in the garden.
[14:26.880 --> 14:30.320]  Of course, I've got four or five, three or four or four or five different males and reversals
[14:30.320 --> 14:33.880]  that I work with, but I'm still limited to how many things I can produce.
[14:33.880 --> 14:38.680]  So I take my male plan or my reverse plant and I hit it to 10 or 12 different ladies.
[14:38.680 --> 14:42.440]  And then that's what I've got to offer for this season or this section of my, uh, took
[14:42.440 --> 14:45.500]  up that much breeding time until I do more breeding or whatever.
[14:45.500 --> 14:49.600]  So I can offer you so much, but the other breeders, they've got totally different shit
[14:49.600 --> 14:50.600]  than me.
[14:50.600 --> 14:54.680]  So they can definitely diversify your portfolio a little more widely, uh, cause they're not
[14:54.680 --> 14:56.160]  breeding with the same stock.
[14:56.160 --> 14:58.280]  So, uh, dude, I love your input.
[14:58.280 --> 14:59.280]  I love your feedback.
[14:59.280 --> 15:00.280]  I love your idea.
[15:00.280 --> 15:01.600]  And I also love that.
[15:01.600 --> 15:04.000]  I disagree and we're still going to be fucking good friends.
[15:04.000 --> 15:05.000]  All right.
[15:05.000 --> 15:06.000]  You said, what did he say?
[15:06.000 --> 15:09.200]  He said, uh, think about flavors and effects, bro flavors and effects.
[15:09.200 --> 15:10.200]  That's my favorite shit.
[15:10.200 --> 15:12.480]  Uh, love good turps and I love to get straight up high.
[15:12.480 --> 15:14.760]  But then he said, have fruit.
[15:14.760 --> 15:15.760]  I offer fruit.
[15:15.760 --> 15:20.840]  I definitely offer fruit, uh, fruit from me, strawberry starburst, lemon Jeffrey, uh,
[15:20.840 --> 15:23.760]  all kinds of fruity shit in my lineup, orange chasm, sun kiss.
[15:23.760 --> 15:25.240]  It's all got fruit in the name of it.
[15:25.480 --> 15:28.040]  Uh, gas, the machine is gassy.
[15:28.040 --> 15:29.520]  The machine is definitely gassy.
[15:29.520 --> 15:31.000]  Garlic, garlic goat.
[15:31.000 --> 15:32.720]  Um, also what's the other one?
[15:32.720 --> 15:34.720]  A dark hollow has the garlic in it.
[15:34.720 --> 15:35.720]  Mint.
[15:35.720 --> 15:37.520]  Um, the Mel Franks Durbin poison crosses.
[15:37.520 --> 15:40.760]  If you guys have been following along, you know that I've gotten access to a bunch of
[15:40.760 --> 15:41.760]  plants.
[15:41.760 --> 15:45.920]  The Mel Franks Durbin poison is what the M F D P stands for.
[15:45.920 --> 15:47.600]  That is Mel Franks Durbin poison.
[15:47.600 --> 15:49.120]  That's got the mint in there.
[15:49.120 --> 15:50.120]  Earth.
[15:50.120 --> 15:55.120]  Um, the, which one's got the earth, the moon tower has definitely got the earth in there.
[15:56.000 --> 15:57.000]  So I've got a lot of those covered.
[15:57.000 --> 15:58.640]  Uh, the soaring highs.
[15:58.640 --> 16:02.000]  Most of my stuff has got that soaring high, the Jack, the Ripper crosses, they're all
[16:02.000 --> 16:03.000]  soaring high.
[16:03.000 --> 16:05.680]  The arise crosses that pile driver heavy stuff.
[16:05.680 --> 16:09.680]  That is kind of where I'm lacking, but I'm working toward that direction.
[16:09.680 --> 16:14.400]  That's not, uh, that's not my favorite thing, but as I'm getting older, um, so it's funny.
[16:14.400 --> 16:18.560]  I went through a weird shift in the weed that I like, I guess when I was younger, I just
[16:18.560 --> 16:19.560]  wanted to get baked.
[16:19.560 --> 16:24.280]  I was so hyper and so fucking rambunctious that I just wanted to get baked and sit down,
[16:24.280 --> 16:29.080]  just fucking give me enough fucking heavy, heavy weed, enough Indica to just make me
[16:29.080 --> 16:30.120]  fucking normal.
[16:30.120 --> 16:32.960]  Just, just chill me out just a little fucking bit.
[16:32.960 --> 16:34.960]  And then as I got older, I started working more.
[16:34.960 --> 16:36.640]  I was like, I can't smoke all this Indica.
[16:36.640 --> 16:37.640]  I got shit to do.
[16:37.640 --> 16:42.280]  And then I started smoking more sativa, started owning businesses and fucking doing podcasts.
[16:42.280 --> 16:45.720]  And when you smoke a big dab of some Indica that puts you down on a podcast and you're
[16:45.720 --> 16:49.440]  just sitting here like this, it's not a good podcast.
[16:49.440 --> 16:52.720]  You gotta be fucking sativa out and be talkative and have the brain go.
[16:52.720 --> 16:54.440]  And so I shifted into that.
[16:54.440 --> 16:58.160]  But now, um, in the winter time, I feel like I've been going too fast.
[16:58.160 --> 16:59.440]  I just need to chill out.
[16:59.440 --> 17:03.760]  I need some time with the lady time with the dogs time on the couch, just chilling.
[17:03.760 --> 17:07.000]  Sometimes I know that my lady's looking at me like you're just going way too fast.
[17:07.000 --> 17:10.320]  So that's when I need like a big dab of some chilled out Indica.
[17:10.320 --> 17:14.520]  So I am kind of working toward that Indica sort of cushy sort of stuff in the lineup.
[17:14.520 --> 17:15.560]  So many people are doing it.
[17:15.560 --> 17:17.000]  I want to do it uniquely.
[17:17.000 --> 17:21.720]  I do have a great strategy for that, but it seems like I'm offering most of the things
[17:21.720 --> 17:22.800]  you ask for.
[17:22.800 --> 17:28.040]  But still, uh, don't be afraid to branch out and have more breeders in your garden.
[17:28.040 --> 17:29.960]  There's no reason to lock it in with just one.
[17:29.960 --> 17:33.920]  I know a lot of people try to do all Irie, all Irie runs in their garden.
[17:33.920 --> 17:36.880]  I appreciate that, but don't be afraid to grow other breeders.
[17:36.880 --> 17:39.600]  Mobius, my dude, that was a fucking great question.
[17:39.600 --> 17:40.600]  A great comment.
[17:40.600 --> 17:42.600]  You got me rambling for at least 10 minutes on that shit.
[17:42.600 --> 17:44.200]  I do appreciate that.
[17:44.200 --> 17:45.200]  Thank you, bro.
[17:45.200 --> 17:46.800]  I look forward to hanging out, smoking with you sometime soon.
[17:46.800 --> 17:49.700]  Uh, you're just a couple of States away from me.
[17:49.700 --> 17:50.700]  We should get together.
[17:50.700 --> 17:51.700]  All right.
[17:51.700 --> 17:53.060]  I got another message here in front of me.
[17:53.060 --> 17:58.700]  Uh, this one came from the, uh, the grow help tab on Irie genetics.com.
[17:58.700 --> 18:01.700]  If you go to Irie genetics.com, there's a tab that says grow help.
[18:01.700 --> 18:05.180]  You can click on there and it will give you the opportunity to ask me a question.
[18:05.180 --> 18:07.580]  I will print that out and read it here on the show.
[18:07.580 --> 18:09.540]  A quick update.
[18:09.540 --> 18:11.040]  That tab was broken for a little while.
[18:11.040 --> 18:15.740]  So if you sent me some grow help questions and you feel like I ignored you, uh, I did
[18:15.740 --> 18:16.900]  and it wasn't on purpose.
[18:16.900 --> 18:19.340]  That fucking grow help tab had a major malfunction.
[18:19.340 --> 18:22.140]  I did some website updates and that did not get corrected.
[18:22.140 --> 18:24.940]  Uh, along with the updates, a shout out to the web guy.
[18:24.940 --> 18:25.940]  He did correct it.
[18:25.940 --> 18:26.940]  Now there was a short time.
[18:26.940 --> 18:27.940]  It didn't work.
[18:27.940 --> 18:28.940]  Nobody's fault.
[18:28.940 --> 18:29.940]  We didn't notice.
[18:29.940 --> 18:32.360]  Uh, there's a lot of shit that goes on when we do that, but anyway, it is corrected.
[18:32.360 --> 18:37.380]  So if you've sent your grow help questions and you feel like you got ignored, I apologize.
[18:37.380 --> 18:38.380]  That shit was broken.
[18:38.380 --> 18:39.380]  Send it again.
[18:39.380 --> 18:41.940]  I'll do my best to get it on the show as soon as possible.
[18:41.940 --> 18:42.940]  All right.
[18:42.940 --> 18:44.260]  This one came from our friend.
[18:44.260 --> 18:47.620]  I don't know if they want their name said it doesn't say that part.
[18:47.620 --> 18:49.980]  Anyway, it says Rasta Jeff.
[18:49.980 --> 18:54.680]  At what point do signs of nutrient deficiency become fall colors?
[18:54.680 --> 18:57.820]  That's a really good, also kind of a confusing question.
[18:57.820 --> 19:03.100]  I can see how you could confuse some nutrient deficiencies and some of the colors that the
[19:03.100 --> 19:04.700]  plants make at the end as it does.
[19:04.700 --> 19:05.700]  What is called senescence.
[19:05.700 --> 19:08.820]  Uh, it will turn into those fall colors when you start flushing.
[19:08.820 --> 19:10.940]  Uh, there are no nutrients left in the leaves.
[19:10.940 --> 19:13.100]  It will make beautiful fall colors.
[19:13.540 --> 19:17.460]  At what point do nutrient deficiency become fall colors?
[19:17.460 --> 19:22.340]  Um, that depends on if you're flushing or not, I guess it's kind of, um, the fall.
[19:22.340 --> 19:24.300]  Some plants won't make fall colors.
[19:24.300 --> 19:25.740]  Some will make fall colors.
[19:25.740 --> 19:29.340]  Uh, and some will show you those colors because of a nutrient deficiency.
[19:29.340 --> 19:34.300]  I think my answer to this is mostly going to be, this is plant and strain specific.
[19:34.300 --> 19:38.540]  I know that the morning do, uh, if you, uh, let it go long enough, it'll start making
[19:38.540 --> 19:40.620]  orange and goldish color leaves.
[19:40.620 --> 19:42.260]  That always happens during the flush.
[19:42.260 --> 19:43.260]  So that's what you're talking about.
[19:43.260 --> 19:47.540]  The fall colors, almost everything will start turning yellow and pale if you don't feed
[19:47.540 --> 19:48.040]  it.
[19:48.500 --> 19:52.420]  So, um, I think nutrient deficiency, look out for that.
[19:52.420 --> 19:53.700]  You should know what that looks like.
[19:53.700 --> 19:58.300]  The fall colors are going to be phenotypical expression and vary by plant.
[19:58.300 --> 20:02.460]  So, so I think the only way to really determine that would be to grow the plant a couple of
[20:02.460 --> 20:02.980]  times.
[20:03.180 --> 20:05.060]  See if you do get those weird colors.
[20:05.220 --> 20:08.060]  See if you can identify what that color could be caused by.
[20:08.060 --> 20:09.220]  Try to correct it.
[20:09.420 --> 20:11.780]  If you can't correct that, that's probably a problem.
[20:11.780 --> 20:17.100]  That's probably just the plant expressing it's funky end of life, beautiful fall colors.
[20:17.980 --> 20:19.300]  Now there is more to this question.
[20:19.300 --> 20:19.780]  It goes on.
[20:19.780 --> 20:24.100]  It says, also, how do you breed a strain to finish faster?
[20:24.300 --> 20:27.380]  Is it as simple as crossing it with a faster finishing strain?
[20:27.380 --> 20:31.340]  Because I have some blueberry now that finishes in 53 days.
[20:31.340 --> 20:33.220]  It's my favorite I've ever grown.
[20:33.660 --> 20:35.780]  Thank you for all of your info and your podcast.
[20:35.780 --> 20:36.620]  It really helps.
[20:36.620 --> 20:41.420]  Bro, you've got a blueberry that finishes completely done in 53 days.
[20:41.420 --> 20:42.300]  That is impressive.
[20:42.300 --> 20:43.260]  That is amazing.
[20:43.700 --> 20:45.820]  Um, I prefer plants that go a little longer.
[20:45.820 --> 20:50.180]  I think you get, usually get more herb and more potency, but if that thing's finished in
[20:50.180 --> 20:54.260]  53 days and satisfies you, that is a phenomenal plant.
[20:54.260 --> 20:56.700]  You are a lucky dude to have found that in a pheno hunt.
[20:56.900 --> 20:58.540]  Uh, everybody wants a clone of that.
[20:58.540 --> 21:00.780]  I'll give you my, uh, my address for a clone of that one.
[21:01.220 --> 21:02.580]  Let's stay focused here.
[21:03.300 --> 21:06.620]  Uh, the question was, how do you breed a strain to finish faster?
[21:06.860 --> 21:12.060]  Um, then he says, is it as simple as crossing it with a faster finishing strain?
[21:12.620 --> 21:16.060]  It is that easy, but it's also not that easy.
[21:16.060 --> 21:20.700]  It kind of depends on what you plan to do with the seeds, because the first batch
[21:20.940 --> 21:24.660]  is going to be a little bit, uh, unstable as the word that I want to use here.
[21:24.660 --> 21:26.460]  You're going to find a lot of variation.
[21:26.460 --> 21:28.540]  You're going to find phenotypical variation.
[21:28.860 --> 21:32.420]  And in that variation, we will find different finishing times.
[21:32.540 --> 21:34.580]  So this is a trait that gets passed on.
[21:34.860 --> 21:37.940]  So what I would do, I would find the female that you like, but you want to
[21:37.940 --> 21:39.900]  slow or speed up her flowering time.
[21:40.140 --> 21:44.140]  You want to take her from 70 to 60, or maybe even down to 50 days.
[21:44.500 --> 21:46.780]  You might not be able to do this in the first attempt.
[21:46.780 --> 21:48.260]  So let's talk about this.
[21:48.260 --> 21:51.780]  It kind of depends on if you want to breed these seeds for yourself, just to
[21:51.780 --> 21:55.380]  play with, or if you have some intention of putting these seeds out to market.
[21:55.980 --> 22:00.300]  If you find a good female plant that you want to use as your female candidate, I
[22:00.300 --> 22:05.300]  would find a male plant that flowers more quickly than that female.
[22:05.300 --> 22:06.740]  I would find a drastic difference.
[22:06.980 --> 22:10.500]  If you've got a female that goes 70 days, you're trying to chop it down to 60.
[22:10.740 --> 22:14.180]  I'd find a male plant that finishes around that 55 day mark.
[22:14.340 --> 22:16.700]  That way you've got the ratio in there, right in the middle somewhere.
[22:16.700 --> 22:20.380]  You'll get that early finishing phenotype, but what's going to happen.
[22:21.220 --> 22:23.020]  Or what most likely is going to happen.
[22:23.020 --> 22:26.340]  These are plants and this is nature, and I haven't drawn a Punnett square or a
[22:26.340 --> 22:30.180]  Mendel chart to actually figure this out completely perfectly, but so you take
[22:30.220 --> 22:34.060]  that long finishing female and that short finishing male and you pollinate.
[22:34.260 --> 22:39.220]  Now, 33% of those seeds are going to be shorter finishing phenotypes.
[22:39.420 --> 22:43.020]  33% of those seeds are going to be longer finishing phenotypes.
[22:43.220 --> 22:45.860]  And the other 33 have the potential to be whatever.
[22:45.860 --> 22:48.780]  When we breed like this, we kind of unlock Pandora's box.
[22:48.780 --> 22:50.540]  The F1s are going to be wild.
[22:50.820 --> 22:54.420]  So if you're breeding this just for yourself, you do have the potential to
[22:54.420 --> 22:59.780]  find that early finishing phenotype in the F1 generation that you are making.
[23:00.060 --> 23:03.620]  If you are selling these seeds and you're going to tell people that they
[23:03.620 --> 23:08.660]  finish quickly, the F1 generation will not be stable or reliable.
[23:08.860 --> 23:13.460]  You will need to make an F2, F3, possibly even an F4 generation.
[23:13.780 --> 23:17.580]  So the first time you do it, find that fast finishing male, pollinate your
[23:17.580 --> 23:21.780]  longer finishing female, and you've got a batch of seeds, grow those seeds.
[23:22.060 --> 23:25.820]  You may find what you're looking for for yourself in that batch of seeds.
[23:26.100 --> 23:29.620]  If you do find earlier finishing phenotypes in that batch, I would
[23:29.660 --> 23:33.900]  encourage you to use those either for back crossing or for further filial
[23:33.900 --> 23:37.900]  generations to even further reduce the flowering time of this plant.
[23:38.100 --> 23:40.700]  Let me say that in a little bit more clear terms, because I know that was a
[23:40.700 --> 23:42.740]  lot of crazy mumbo jumbo for some of you.
[23:43.060 --> 23:44.780]  So we've made this first cross, right?
[23:45.380 --> 23:48.700]  We took our long finishing girl, our short finishing male, we made seeds.
[23:49.100 --> 23:54.260]  Out of that, I expect that hopefully we find at least one quick finishing girl.
[23:54.260 --> 23:56.740]  Also, we're going to find one quick finishing boy.
[23:57.060 --> 23:58.580]  This is our F1 generation.
[23:58.580 --> 24:00.660]  We've got an F1 boy and F1 girl.
[24:00.940 --> 24:02.420]  Let's put them together and pollinate.
[24:02.420 --> 24:04.460]  We have now made an F2 generation.
[24:04.740 --> 24:09.100]  From there, let's find that quickest finishing female and quickest finishing
[24:09.100 --> 24:11.180]  male and breed those together.
[24:11.340 --> 24:12.620]  Now we're making F3.
[24:12.620 --> 24:13.060]  Guess what?
[24:13.060 --> 24:16.940]  These F3s are going to start getting a little bit more uniform, or they're
[24:16.940 --> 24:20.140]  going to be completely wild, depending on the selections which we have made.
[24:20.460 --> 24:21.940]  But we're going to focus again.
[24:21.940 --> 24:25.140]  We're going to find that quick finishing phenotypes.
[24:25.140 --> 24:28.180]  Now we're going to find the super quickest finishing phenotypes we can
[24:28.420 --> 24:29.660]  out of the boy and the girl.
[24:29.820 --> 24:31.300]  We're going to breed them together.
[24:31.460 --> 24:33.900]  Now at this point, we've really started locking in that
[24:33.900 --> 24:36.140]  super fast finishing phenotype.
[24:36.420 --> 24:41.180]  Everything from here out should be closer to the goal amount of finishing
[24:41.180 --> 24:44.380]  days that we're looking for, for the phenotypes, which we have to select from.
[24:44.780 --> 24:46.460]  So you probably started with that female.
[24:46.460 --> 24:48.140]  I said, started at 70 days.
[24:48.420 --> 24:51.420]  Uh, the F1 generation, you found one that finished it like what?
[24:51.420 --> 24:52.300]  60 days.
[24:52.460 --> 24:53.580]  We bred those together.
[24:53.580 --> 24:55.100]  Then we found more that finished at what?
[24:55.100 --> 24:56.180]  58 days.
[24:56.380 --> 24:59.420]  Then we found some that finished at 55 and then we kept working
[24:59.420 --> 25:00.580]  with those and breeding them out.
[25:00.580 --> 25:03.740]  And now we're all the way to the F5 generation and we've got reliable
[25:03.740 --> 25:06.580]  plants that finish in 55 days.
[25:07.060 --> 25:09.300]  It will take you several generations to get there.
[25:09.300 --> 25:12.860]  If you want reliable homogenous seeds, or stable is the word we'd
[25:12.860 --> 25:14.380]  like to use in the cannabis industry.
[25:14.700 --> 25:18.660]  But you can do it, or you could just do it the simple way, cross it one time
[25:18.660 --> 25:20.540]  and hope to find what you're looking for.
[25:20.700 --> 25:24.420]  You do have the potential to shorten that flowering time every filial
[25:24.420 --> 25:26.740]  generation, if you do proper selections.
[25:26.940 --> 25:30.380]  So here's another piece of advice, another hint, another tip of what I would do.
[25:30.660 --> 25:33.420]  I would do parallel breeding lines.
[25:33.420 --> 25:35.860]  I don't talk about this a lot on the show, but I have mentioned it.
[25:36.220 --> 25:40.940]  We're focusing on faster finishing lines for the first part of this question.
[25:40.940 --> 25:44.180]  We want to get down to, you've got one that finishes in 53 days.
[25:44.180 --> 25:47.860]  I wouldn't go any shorter than that, but I would breed that to other things and
[25:47.860 --> 25:49.300]  try to make that other shit shorter.
[25:49.300 --> 25:52.180]  I would reverse it and breed it to some 70 day stuff.
[25:52.420 --> 25:56.180]  And then I would reverse the 53 day finisher, take the pollen from that, put
[25:56.180 --> 25:59.660]  it on a 70 day finisher and see if I can reduce that flowering time.
[25:59.660 --> 26:00.700]  I would definitely do that.
[26:00.700 --> 26:03.700]  But let me get back into the main topic of what I'm saying here.
[26:03.940 --> 26:06.940]  We're breeding on this line for flowering time.
[26:06.940 --> 26:10.220]  So keep directing that breeding towards shorter flowering time.
[26:10.620 --> 26:14.660]  Then from the same batch of seeds, that F1 batch of seeds you make.
[26:14.820 --> 26:18.980]  So you took the 70 day plant and the 55 day male or whatever you pollinated
[26:18.980 --> 26:20.260]  them, you made a batch of seeds.
[26:20.460 --> 26:24.820]  We found that short finishing one of the male and the girl, and that's our, uh,
[26:24.820 --> 26:26.620]  we're going to call that the fast line.
[26:26.820 --> 26:32.460]  Now on the other side, let's focus on, uh, potency because not only do I want
[26:32.460 --> 26:35.740]  that plant to finish quickly, but I also need it to be highly potent.
[26:35.980 --> 26:39.220]  So I'm going to breed a whole nother project in another room.
[26:39.220 --> 26:42.220]  This is another project I'm going to breed just for potency.
[26:42.220 --> 26:44.380]  I don't care how long these plants take to finish.
[26:44.620 --> 26:46.700]  I don't care what they taste like, what they look like.
[26:46.700 --> 26:47.700]  I need potency.
[26:47.700 --> 26:50.620]  So I'm going to find a male and a female out of these seeds.
[26:50.620 --> 26:51.660]  I'm going to breed them.
[26:51.980 --> 26:54.540]  I'm going to find the most highly potent or I'm going to grow them.
[26:54.820 --> 26:57.620]  I'm going to find the best looking, most potent female I can.
[26:57.820 --> 26:59.700]  And the most potent looking male that I can find.
[26:59.700 --> 27:02.700]  That's a hard one to discern there, but find the best female, the
[27:02.700 --> 27:04.060]  best dude and breed them.
[27:04.220 --> 27:06.540]  Then I'm going to grow out those seeds, the F2 seeds.
[27:06.540 --> 27:09.660]  I'm going to grow those once again, find the most potent female
[27:09.660 --> 27:10.740]  and the most potent male.
[27:10.900 --> 27:11.700]  I'm going to breed them.
[27:11.700 --> 27:16.340]  I'm going to go F3, F4, F5 doing the same thing solely focused on potency.
[27:16.620 --> 27:21.180]  Now, when I get to F5 or F6, I'm going to take my fast finishing version of this
[27:21.180 --> 27:27.060]  line and my highly potent version of this line, and I'm going to breed those together.
[27:27.220 --> 27:33.420]  And that's how I make my own true F1 line that is fast finishing and highly potent
[27:33.580 --> 27:35.420]  and also has the other traits you're looking for.
[27:35.420 --> 27:38.700]  The reason I want to do these two lines separately is because it's really
[27:38.700 --> 27:41.220]  hard to isolate multiple traits.
[27:41.220 --> 27:45.820]  If you're breeding for specifically that finishing time, stick with that fast
[27:45.820 --> 27:51.180]  finishing time, get that to a F4, F5, then find a male out of that and use that
[27:51.180 --> 27:54.980]  male to pollinate other ladies to make that fast finishing time.
[27:54.980 --> 27:58.020]  So then on the other line, I would focus on the potency.
[27:58.020 --> 28:02.300]  Instead of focusing on potency and flowering time, just use two
[28:02.300 --> 28:03.700]  different lines of the same thing.
[28:03.900 --> 28:08.020]  So now let's say that that tall, longer finishing plant is strawberry fields.
[28:08.260 --> 28:11.940]  And that shorter finishing plant that I want to use for my male is arise.
[28:12.140 --> 28:15.140]  He's not a quick finisher and not a quick flowering plant, but we're going to say
[28:15.140 --> 28:16.580]  that for the sake of this project.
[28:16.980 --> 28:21.340]  Let's say I took that arise and I pollinate these strawberry fields or that makes
[28:21.420 --> 28:23.020]  strawberry starburst seeds.
[28:23.020 --> 28:23.860]  It really does.
[28:24.220 --> 28:28.100]  Now let's say that I want to focus on breeding one for quicker finishing and focus
[28:28.100 --> 28:30.220]  on one for that super potency.
[28:30.460 --> 28:36.060]  I would breed strawberry starburst A, the A line straight up for that quicker
[28:36.060 --> 28:36.580]  finishing.
[28:36.580 --> 28:40.340]  Then I would breed the strawberry starburst B line for the potency.
[28:40.500 --> 28:43.740]  And while I was doing it, if I let the seeds out to market, or if I shared them,
[28:43.740 --> 28:47.940]  sold them, passed them out in any way, I would clearly label them strawberry
[28:47.940 --> 28:55.820]  starburst F1 A line or strawberry starburst A line F1, B line F2, B line F3.
[28:55.980 --> 28:57.460]  Just make sure that they are labeled.
[28:57.660 --> 29:00.460]  And then those seeds will be great seeds on their own.
[29:00.460 --> 29:01.500]  They're still going to be potent.
[29:01.500 --> 29:04.540]  They're going to have all the other traits you're looking for, but I'm specifically
[29:04.540 --> 29:07.860]  breeding for one thing in my plan, in my strategy.
[29:08.180 --> 29:12.580]  Now, when I get that one to where I know that they flower in 55 days, and when I
[29:12.580 --> 29:15.780]  get this one, where I know that the potency is off the charts, I'm going to use that
[29:15.780 --> 29:20.100]  quicker flowering male, hit that super potent female, and hopefully I can get a
[29:20.100 --> 29:23.140]  60 day finisher that blows your fucking mind.
[29:23.380 --> 29:26.860]  So I hope that made sense because yes, it can be that easy.
[29:26.980 --> 29:30.980]  It can be as easy as pollinating a female plant with a quicker finishing male plant.
[29:31.180 --> 29:32.540]  Yes, it can be that easy.
[29:32.540 --> 29:35.820]  But if you want to sell those seeds, if you want to put them to market, if you
[29:35.820 --> 29:39.180]  really want to continue that project, there is more work to done and that is
[29:39.180 --> 29:41.820]  breeding them to different filial generations.
[29:41.820 --> 29:45.900]  And if you're going to focus on speed, I would breed that beeline to focus on
[29:45.900 --> 29:48.740]  potency, breed them together at some point in the future.
[29:48.940 --> 29:49.180]  All right.
[29:49.180 --> 29:50.820]  That message came from our friend Michael.
[29:50.820 --> 29:54.020]  Once again, that did come from the Grow Help tab on the website.
[29:54.260 --> 29:55.900]  Michael, thank you for the great question.
[29:56.060 --> 29:58.100]  That one really did get me rambling quite well.
