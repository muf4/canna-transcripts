[00:00.000 --> 00:01.920]  Yo, what's up podcast world?
[00:01.920 --> 00:06.000]  It's Ross DeJeff and it is time for episode 348 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.000 --> 00:07.960]  No fancy music or intro this time.
[00:07.960 --> 00:09.960]  We're going to do a quick episode.
[00:09.960 --> 00:14.400]  As you were listening to this, I am probably still in Denver having a good time from the
[00:14.400 --> 00:15.900]  holiday weekend.
[00:15.900 --> 00:19.880]  My favorite band, Phish, was in Denver Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
[00:19.880 --> 00:23.760]  And as you're listening to this on Monday, I'm probably still in Denver hanging out with
[00:23.760 --> 00:24.760]  some friends.
[00:24.760 --> 00:26.840]  So I hope you had a great holiday weekend.
[00:26.840 --> 00:28.360]  I hope you got to party with your family.
[00:28.360 --> 00:30.720]  I hope you got to party with some friends.
[00:30.720 --> 00:35.400]  Maybe you got to consume cannabis with a family member, which you've never smoked before.
[00:35.400 --> 00:38.520]  Maybe you found out somebody in your family is a cannabis consumer and you guys snuck
[00:38.520 --> 00:40.880]  off and had one of them barbecue joints together.
[00:40.880 --> 00:42.200]  I love that sort of shit.
[00:42.200 --> 00:44.320]  Whatever happened, I hope you guys had a great weekend.
[00:44.320 --> 00:47.960]  I usually start these episodes off by letting you know what I am dabbing on.
[00:47.960 --> 00:53.920]  Right now, I am loading up a fresh dab of Custom OG's Nectar from Green Dot Labs.
[00:53.920 --> 00:57.700]  This is of course a combo of Skittles and Afghoulary.
[00:57.700 --> 01:01.800]  It is described as assorted hard candies on the aroma and flavor.
[01:01.800 --> 01:06.960]  When I cracked open this fresh jar of concentrates, I made a little noise like a little boy that
[01:06.960 --> 01:09.540]  just got a fresh box of Ninja Turtles or some shit.
[01:09.540 --> 01:11.880]  I went, ooh, when I opened this.
[01:11.880 --> 01:14.340]  This gram of concentrates is beautiful.
[01:14.340 --> 01:17.500]  This I, I really think this is a heavy gram.
[01:17.500 --> 01:19.620]  There's more than a gram of hash in here.
[01:19.620 --> 01:24.820]  This is super chunky, lots of crystals, very little terp liquid, which is what I prefer.
[01:24.820 --> 01:28.700]  I'd prefer lots of crystals and a very minimal amount of the terpy liquid.
[01:28.700 --> 01:31.260]  I get enough terps, just, just enough to add the flavor.
[01:31.260 --> 01:32.320]  That's all I need.
[01:32.320 --> 01:34.700]  This gram is glorious.
[01:34.700 --> 01:37.460]  Caused me to make a little Robin Williams noise when I opened it.
[01:37.460 --> 01:43.100]  So I'm getting myself a little chunk of this Custom OG's Nectar scooped into my insert
[01:43.100 --> 01:44.100]  here.
[01:44.100 --> 01:45.340]  I'm going to take an insert dab.
[01:45.340 --> 01:47.300]  And then after that, we're going to get into a podcast.
[01:47.300 --> 01:50.900]  I think we're going to talk a little bit about CBD and then we will probably read a news
[01:50.900 --> 01:51.900]  article.
[01:51.900 --> 01:54.520]  And then we may read a couple of emails and then we're going to wrap it up and get out
[01:55.220 --> 01:56.220]  of here.
[01:56.220 --> 01:59.880]  This is not going to be a super long episode, but I wanted to make sure to have a quality
[01:59.880 --> 02:02.640]  show prepared for Monday because I haven't missed a week.
[02:02.640 --> 02:05.400]  You guys, I've been doing this show for close to five years, I think.
[02:05.400 --> 02:07.760]  And I have not missed a Monday in five years.
[02:07.760 --> 02:09.800]  There was one Monday when I was super sick.
[02:09.800 --> 02:10.800]  I had a head cold.
[02:10.800 --> 02:11.800]  I sounded like shit.
[02:11.800 --> 02:16.120]  I wasn't a Monday, but there was a show coming up and I wasn't able to really do a good show.
[02:16.120 --> 02:19.440]  So I called the crew and I'm sure you guys remember everybody came over.
[02:19.440 --> 02:23.960]  Adam, Jesse, and Mike all came over and we recorded a hilarious podcast while I was sick.
[02:24.400 --> 02:27.840]  I basically sat at the table and ran the equipment and everybody talked over me for the whole
[02:27.840 --> 02:32.000]  show, but I have not missed a single episode in approximately five years.
[02:32.000 --> 02:35.720]  So I had to make sure to come give you guys a quality Monday show because I'm heating
[02:35.720 --> 02:37.120]  the shit out of the banger while I'm talking.
[02:37.120 --> 02:40.480]  If you hear the torch in the background, I apologize if I sound slightly distracted,
[02:40.480 --> 02:42.400]  it's because I'm paying attention to the torch in the nail.
[02:42.400 --> 02:44.000]  I'm getting this sucker nice and hot.
[02:44.000 --> 02:46.320]  I feel like it's almost there.
[02:46.320 --> 02:48.160]  I just want to heat it up just a little bit more.
[02:48.160 --> 02:51.760]  There's a little, actually a little black mark of an oil stain on the banger.
[02:51.760 --> 02:53.720]  I'm going to heat it until that goes away.
[02:53.720 --> 02:56.920]  And then as soon as that's gone, it looks like it has disappeared.
[02:56.920 --> 02:57.920]  Turn off the torch.
[02:57.920 --> 03:01.560]  Then I drop the insert right into the banger.
[03:01.560 --> 03:02.560]  Then I get a carb cap.
[03:02.560 --> 03:05.080]  I place the carb cap right on top of that.
[03:05.080 --> 03:08.880]  And now I'm just going to let it sit here until I see it actually starting to smoke
[03:08.880 --> 03:09.880]  a little bit.
[03:09.880 --> 03:13.440]  Once the banger fills with a little smoke and maybe a little of the smoke comes out
[03:13.440 --> 03:15.260]  of the top of the carb cap, there it goes.
[03:15.260 --> 03:16.260]  That's when I'm going to hit it.
[03:16.260 --> 03:17.260]  So let's dab.
[03:17.260 --> 03:32.720]  You guys dab with me.
[03:32.720 --> 03:35.220]  That was like the perfect size dab.
[03:36.220 --> 03:39.220]  The first bowl was super thick, nice and chunky.
[03:39.220 --> 03:43.220]  Then I got a nice little backup pool off of that.
[03:43.220 --> 03:44.220]  Woo!
[03:44.220 --> 03:46.220]  I'm getting nicely medicated from that.
[03:46.220 --> 03:51.220]  It's leaving a, like a, uh, it tastes apple candies right away.
[03:51.220 --> 03:56.020]  It tastes like a sour apple Jolly Rancher, but it's kind of changing into something sweeter
[03:56.020 --> 03:58.220]  and fruitier as it goes.
[03:58.220 --> 04:01.220]  That's going to take a couple of seconds for that one to work through my brain.
[04:01.720 --> 04:06.220]  You guys excuse me while my brain swims around like a little goldfish in my head right now.
[04:06.220 --> 04:08.220]  I'm getting dabbed the fuck out.
[04:08.220 --> 04:09.220]  That was a beautiful dab.
[04:09.220 --> 04:12.220]  Hey, one thing I want to mention while I'm high and just rambly.
[04:12.220 --> 04:14.220]  I see people taking dab videos on Instagram and I love it.
[04:14.220 --> 04:16.220]  Keep doing your big dabs on Instagram.
[04:16.220 --> 04:20.220]  But when you cap the banger, leave that fucking carb cap on there.
[04:20.220 --> 04:25.220]  So I'm going to grab my rig and kind of just so that I can kind of give myself a better
[04:25.220 --> 04:26.220]  idea of what I'm seeing.
[04:26.220 --> 04:30.220]  So when you hit the, you put the carb cap on and then you hit it, right?
[04:30.220 --> 04:33.220]  And then you're going to lift the carb cap off a little bit to kind of carve it and let
[04:33.220 --> 04:36.220]  yourself clear the rig and get that smoke when you're like when your lungs are full.
[04:36.220 --> 04:37.220]  You do the.
[04:39.220 --> 04:43.220]  And you exhale, you can hear the noises I'm doing, and I think I think it's coming
[04:43.220 --> 04:44.220]  through on the mic.
[04:44.220 --> 04:45.220]  So you pull and you get this right.
[04:48.740 --> 04:50.740]  You get those little a couple of moments.
[04:50.740 --> 04:53.740]  You lift the cap off to where you can get oxygen through there so you can clear the
[04:53.740 --> 04:55.740]  rig and get all that smoke into your lungs.
[04:55.740 --> 04:57.740]  And then you fill your lungs and then you exhale.
[04:57.740 --> 05:00.740]  Then you go back in and repeat the process, right?
[05:00.740 --> 05:02.740]  Something that I don't know why it drives me fucking crazy.
[05:02.740 --> 05:04.740]  It just bugs the shit out of me.
[05:04.740 --> 05:08.740]  When you're exhaling your dab, don't take the carb cap off the banger.
[05:08.740 --> 05:09.740]  Just leave the carb cap on there.
[05:09.740 --> 05:12.740]  There's no reason to keep removing the carb cap.
[05:12.740 --> 05:14.740]  You're letting the heat escape.
[05:14.740 --> 05:18.740]  The whole idea of putting that carb cap on there is to trap the heat inside that nail
[05:18.740 --> 05:19.740]  inside that banger.
[05:20.740 --> 05:23.740]  And every time you lift the carb cap, you're allowing all that heat to leave.
[05:23.740 --> 05:25.740]  So just leave that carb cap on there.
[05:25.740 --> 05:26.740]  Yes, I get it.
[05:26.740 --> 05:28.740]  You want to lift it up to pull the to clear it, but then put it back.
[05:29.740 --> 05:31.740]  Just like it should sound like this.
[05:35.080 --> 05:38.080]  And now when I'm exhaling, my carb cap is still on the banger.
[05:38.080 --> 05:42.080]  And now I'm going to go back in and those little whistles that you hear, the little
[05:44.080 --> 05:46.080]  that's when I lift up the banger or the carb cap to let air flow.
[05:46.080 --> 05:47.080]  That's all you need.
[05:47.080 --> 05:49.080]  Just a couple of just carb.
[05:49.080 --> 05:50.080]  I don't leave.
[05:50.080 --> 05:51.080]  I don't know.
[05:51.080 --> 05:54.080]  I think it's silly to cap it, trap that heat in there, then let the cap off,
[05:54.080 --> 05:57.080]  let the heat escape, then try to recap it and re get that heat going.
[05:57.080 --> 05:59.080]  If you leave it in there, your dab will be better.
[06:00.080 --> 06:01.080]  That's just my opinion.
[06:01.080 --> 06:04.080]  For some reason, it drives me fucking nuts watching people take the cap off
[06:04.080 --> 06:08.080]  and leave the cap off and exhale their dab and look at the camera all silly
[06:08.080 --> 06:10.080]  and blow a kiss and then put the cap on and go back in.
[06:10.080 --> 06:12.080]  Just leave the cap on there, bro.
[06:12.080 --> 06:16.080]  But now, on the other hand, when you're done with the dab, take the fucking
[06:16.080 --> 06:19.080]  carb cap off because when you set that rig on the table or when you try to set
[06:19.080 --> 06:22.080]  the rig on the table and the carb cap falls off and lands on the carpet and
[06:22.080 --> 06:27.080]  gets all that carpet fuzz stuck to the sticky carb cap or even worse, when the
[06:27.080 --> 06:31.080]  carb cap rolls off and lands on the fucking tile floor and shatters, that's
[06:31.080 --> 06:32.080]  terrible.
[06:32.080 --> 06:37.080]  So take the cap off when you're done and set the cap down on an oil slick pad
[06:37.080 --> 06:40.080]  or pay attention to where people are setting the tool so that you have just
[06:40.080 --> 06:42.080]  like one designated sticky spot.
[06:42.080 --> 06:43.080]  Don't go sticky up the whole table.
[06:43.080 --> 06:46.080]  Pay attention to how other people are doing it, but set the carb cap down,
[06:46.080 --> 06:48.080]  then set the rig down.
[06:48.080 --> 06:54.080]  You guys, if there is a mood mat or some sort of a mat for the rig, try to set
[06:54.080 --> 06:58.080]  the rig on that mat because some of the collectors and the heady boys, if you
[06:58.080 --> 07:04.080]  set your glass rig down directly on the wooden table, ooh, that's offensive to
[07:04.080 --> 07:05.080]  some people.
[07:05.080 --> 07:10.080]  I don't really care because I understand it's a glass pipe that I bought that is
[07:10.080 --> 07:14.080]  likely going to get broken, but a lot of people spend a lot of money on really
[07:14.080 --> 07:18.080]  nice glass and this sound right here, ooh, that's a rig just touching a table.
[07:18.080 --> 07:21.080]  That's a hitman rig just sitting down on a wooden table.
[07:21.080 --> 07:22.080]  That sound drives people nuts.
[07:22.080 --> 07:23.080]  This is what they want to hear.
[07:23.080 --> 07:25.080]  Did you hear that?
[07:25.080 --> 07:26.080]  No, you didn't.
[07:26.080 --> 07:28.080]  It's because I set it down on a little mood mat and it's nice and smooth and
[07:28.080 --> 07:29.080]  protected.
[07:29.080 --> 07:33.080]  So if you see the mood mat, try to utilize it because your heady boy friends may
[07:33.080 --> 07:35.080]  get frustrated with you if you do not.
[07:35.080 --> 07:39.080]  That's just a little tip, you guys, so that you look cool the first time you go
[07:39.080 --> 07:42.080]  to the social club and smoke with all the heady boys.
[07:42.080 --> 07:43.080]  What social club?
[07:43.080 --> 07:46.080]  Oh, that's a great segue into this news article that I've got.
[07:46.080 --> 07:48.080]  I've got a news article from the Cannabis.
[07:48.080 --> 07:53.080]  The headline says Denver's second licensed social marijuana business to open
[07:53.080 --> 07:56.080]  this fall as a vaping bar and lounge.
[07:56.080 --> 07:58.080]  This article is written by a person named John Murray.
[07:58.080 --> 08:01.080]  We're going to get right into it and it goes like this.
[08:01.080 --> 08:05.080]  Denver's licensing director signed off Friday on the city's second license for
[08:05.080 --> 08:10.080]  a marijuana consumption area in a business, paving the way for a vaping bar
[08:10.080 --> 08:12.080]  and lounge to open this fall.
[08:12.080 --> 08:16.080]  The owners of Vapenplay plan to open the 21 and over social lounge and
[08:16.080 --> 08:20.080]  entertainment venue in November or sooner, depending on the timing of a
[08:20.080 --> 08:24.080]  renovation of the building at 1753 South Broadway.
[08:24.080 --> 08:29.080]  Co-owner Taylor Rosen says the lounge will be centered around a multi-station
[08:29.080 --> 08:34.080]  saloon style vape bar, though customers will have to bring their own marijuana
[08:34.080 --> 08:38.080]  per the rules of Denver's 2016 voter passed initiative 300.
[08:38.080 --> 08:41.080]  So there's more to that article, but I think we got the point.
[08:41.080 --> 08:44.080]  Denver is opening a second consumption bar.
[08:44.080 --> 08:45.080]  This is great.
[08:45.080 --> 08:47.080]  This will be a place for tourists to go and consume.
[08:47.080 --> 08:51.080]  This will be a place for people who live in apartments where you're not allowed
[08:51.080 --> 08:52.080]  to smoke.
[08:52.080 --> 08:53.080]  They'll be able to go smoke there.
[08:53.080 --> 08:54.080]  This will be a cool social lounge.
[08:54.080 --> 08:55.080]  We'll be able to have events.
[08:55.080 --> 08:57.080]  They said it's going to be an entertainment venue.
[08:57.080 --> 08:59.080]  That means we may have music there.
[08:59.080 --> 09:01.080]  That means we may have live comedy there.
[09:01.080 --> 09:02.080]  We may do podcasts from there.
[09:02.080 --> 09:05.080]  You never know what could happen at a venue like this.
[09:05.080 --> 09:06.080]  These places are great.
[09:06.080 --> 09:08.080]  And they said it's the second place.
[09:08.080 --> 09:12.080]  I can think of two others and I'm not sure if I should say both of them because
[09:12.080 --> 09:16.080]  that means one is unlicensed and we go dab there and they may get in trouble if
[09:16.080 --> 09:17.080]  I mention it.
[09:17.080 --> 09:22.080]  So I'm snitching on one of them if I say two and I'm not sure if I want to do
[09:22.080 --> 09:23.080]  that.
[09:23.080 --> 09:26.080]  Now that I'm thinking about it, there are several places where we go and
[09:26.080 --> 09:27.080]  consume.
[09:27.080 --> 09:30.080]  So I'm going to click over to Google right quick and see what the first place
[09:30.080 --> 09:31.080]  was.
[09:31.080 --> 09:34.080]  Okay, the first place is I've never even been there.
[09:34.080 --> 09:37.080]  So that means that the places where I'm going and dabbing, you're not supposed
[09:37.080 --> 09:38.080]  to be dabbing there.
[09:38.080 --> 09:40.080]  But I, they don't stop me.
[09:40.080 --> 09:43.080]  I go in and I sit down and I just pull out the rig and take dabs and nobody has
[09:43.080 --> 09:45.080]  ever said, hey bro, you can't dab in here.
[09:45.080 --> 09:50.080]  But anyway, the place where you are allowed to dab is called the coffee joint.
[09:50.080 --> 09:55.080]  That was the first legal and officially licensed adult use recreational cannabis
[09:55.080 --> 09:57.080]  lounge in Denver, Colorado.
[09:57.080 --> 09:59.080]  So shout out to them.
[09:59.080 --> 10:01.080]  Once again, they are called the coffee joint.
[10:01.080 --> 10:04.080]  And just to give them some love, they are on, what's their address?
[10:04.080 --> 10:08.080]  Here it is, 1130 Yuma Court in Denver, Colorado.
[10:08.080 --> 10:12.080]  So now visitors to the Denver area, residents of the Denver area, adults in
[10:12.080 --> 10:18.080]  Denver, visitors, guests, people have a safe place to go consume all of the
[10:18.080 --> 10:21.080]  cannabis that are allowed to go buy at the dispensaries now.
[10:21.080 --> 10:25.080]  We just need for this to spread through Colorado now so that we can have
[10:25.080 --> 10:29.080]  lounges all over the place and have safe access and safe places to consume
[10:29.080 --> 10:31.080]  for everybody.
[10:31.080 --> 10:33.080]  This is good progress again, you guys.
[10:33.080 --> 10:34.080]  I like this.
[10:34.080 --> 10:35.080]  Also, let me rant about this.
[10:35.080 --> 10:39.080]  If you were working on legalizing cannabis recreationally or medically in your
[10:39.080 --> 10:45.080]  area, make sure you include some sort of place to consume your medicine or your
[10:45.080 --> 10:47.080]  recreational cannabis when you're writing the rules.
[10:47.080 --> 10:51.080]  If you don't write it into the rules from the beginning, the opposition will
[10:51.080 --> 10:56.080]  create rules for you and we never like the rules they make for us.
[10:56.080 --> 10:57.080]  So that's super cool.
[10:57.080 --> 10:59.080]  Another smoke lounge in Denver.
[10:59.080 --> 11:02.080]  Hopefully we get them all over Colorado before too long.
[11:02.080 --> 11:05.080]  At the top of the show, I mentioned we were going to talk a little bit about
[11:05.080 --> 11:06.080]  CBD.
[11:06.080 --> 11:08.080]  I don't have a big scientific talk about CBD.
[11:08.080 --> 11:12.080]  I have more of a warning about CBD products.
[11:12.080 --> 11:17.080]  I was hanging out with some friends a few days ago and one of the guy's
[11:17.080 --> 11:20.080]  girlfriends, I'm not familiar with this couple, they were new to the group, she
[11:20.080 --> 11:23.080]  was saying that she was having some back and leg pain.
[11:23.080 --> 11:27.080]  One of the other guy's girlfriends reached into her purse really quickly and
[11:27.080 --> 11:30.080]  was really eager to give her some CBD products.
[11:30.080 --> 11:32.080]  Me being who I am, I was like, what you got there?
[11:32.080 --> 11:33.080]  Can I see the bottle?
[11:33.080 --> 11:35.080]  And she politely gave me the bottle.
[11:35.080 --> 11:37.080]  I was just reading out of curiosity.
[11:37.080 --> 11:39.080]  The label looked a little generic.
[11:39.080 --> 11:42.080]  It looked like they just peeled the label off of another product and put their
[11:42.080 --> 11:45.080]  own shitty paper label around it and tried to pass it off and just replace
[11:45.080 --> 11:47.080]  something.
[11:47.080 --> 11:52.080]  But the label said that each capsule contained 100 milligrams of CBD.
[11:52.080 --> 11:57.080]  It also said that it had MCT oil, which I think is just fancy for coconut oil.
[11:58.080 --> 12:01.080]  And then it also said that it contained fish oil.
[12:01.080 --> 12:05.080]  Now as soon as I saw the words fish oil, I got super suspicious.
[12:05.080 --> 12:07.080]  So I asked her if I could have a couple.
[12:07.080 --> 12:10.080]  There were like 100 of them in the jar and she was super sweet.
[12:10.080 --> 12:12.080]  She's like, yeah, take as many as you want.
[12:12.080 --> 12:15.080]  So I'm thinking, yeah, I'll just pop them in the lid and get a couple.
[12:15.080 --> 12:19.080]  So I pop off the lid and it just reeked of fish oil.
[12:19.080 --> 12:21.080]  And she's like, take as many as you want.
[12:21.080 --> 12:22.080]  It was kind of a large bottle, you guys.
[12:22.080 --> 12:24.080]  There were probably 100 of them in there.
[12:24.080 --> 12:27.080]  I picked out two or three for myself and I had no intentions of eating them.
[12:27.080 --> 12:30.080]  If you listen to the podcast a lot, you know that I'm not a CBD consumer.
[12:30.080 --> 12:32.080]  I prefer high THC.
[12:32.080 --> 12:35.080]  The CBD seems to kind of ruin my THC high.
[12:35.080 --> 12:37.080]  So CBD isn't really for me.
[12:37.080 --> 12:40.080]  But I took a couple of them because I just wanted to play.
[12:40.080 --> 12:43.080]  I wanted to see what the heck she had because she just pulled them out of her
[12:43.080 --> 12:44.080]  purse and was passing them out.
[12:44.080 --> 12:46.080]  They couldn't have been very expensive the way she was sharing them with
[12:46.080 --> 12:47.080]  everybody.
[12:47.080 --> 12:50.080]  And the label looked like she might have got them at like Walmart or something
[12:50.080 --> 12:53.080]  by the looks of this label because it didn't have any sort of medical
[12:53.080 --> 12:54.080]  marijuana labeling.
[12:54.080 --> 12:55.080]  It didn't have any sort of warning.
[12:55.080 --> 12:59.080]  It was just CBD oil capsules is what I think it said.
[12:59.080 --> 13:02.080]  It said 100 milligrams each capsule and there were gelatin caps.
[13:02.080 --> 13:07.080]  And then I flipped it around and it was fish oil was the first ingredient
[13:07.080 --> 13:11.080]  listed and then CBD oil.
[13:11.080 --> 13:15.080]  And they did not define or give any details about the CBD source.
[13:15.080 --> 13:18.080]  So as soon as I got away from the group,
[13:18.080 --> 13:20.080]  because I didn't want to be rude and just crack it open and tell this girl
[13:20.080 --> 13:21.080]  your product is shit.
[13:21.080 --> 13:24.080]  But I could tell her product was shit and I just had a suspicion.
[13:24.080 --> 13:26.080]  I cracked it open and I smelled it.
[13:26.080 --> 13:31.080]  And you guys, I think that they're just selling fish oil pills.
[13:31.080 --> 13:36.080]  That's the only reason I can think of why they would say there's fish oil in
[13:36.080 --> 13:41.080]  there because why the fuck else would you put fish oil in CBD pills?
[13:41.080 --> 13:45.080]  So I'm thinking they're just relabeling some fish oil pills and they're
[13:45.080 --> 13:48.080]  selling them to this very sweet young lady who's very gullible and very
[13:48.080 --> 13:51.080]  young and she's buying them thinking that she's got CBD.
[13:51.080 --> 13:55.080]  Now the added benefit to taking this fish oil is it's probably giving her
[13:55.080 --> 13:58.080]  some sort of physical benefit. It's probably good for her joints.
[13:58.080 --> 13:59.080]  It may be good for her brain.
[13:59.080 --> 14:02.080]  It's probably good for all kinds of stuff in her body.
[14:02.080 --> 14:06.080]  And she's attributing that to the magical effects of CBD.
[14:06.080 --> 14:09.080]  So she's not getting a placebo. She's getting an effect.
[14:09.080 --> 14:12.080]  So she's going to keep buying this product.
[14:12.080 --> 14:16.080]  I can't prove to you that there's no CBD in there.
[14:16.080 --> 14:18.080]  I didn't eat the pills. I threw them away.
[14:18.080 --> 14:20.080]  They kind of melted in my car to be honest with you.
[14:20.080 --> 14:22.080]  After I cracked one of them open, I forgot about them in the car.
[14:22.080 --> 14:23.080]  The other two melted in the car,
[14:23.080 --> 14:28.080]  but I'm very suspicious of what they're putting in that capsule and telling
[14:28.080 --> 14:32.080]  us is CBD. I don't think for the cost of that bottle,
[14:32.080 --> 14:33.080]  that could have been CBD.
[14:33.080 --> 14:38.080]  I don't think for how generous she was with that bottle that those were CBD
[14:38.080 --> 14:39.080]  pills,
[14:39.080 --> 14:42.080]  because that would probably be really expensive for a bottle that big of a
[14:42.080 --> 14:44.080]  hundred milligram CBD pills.
[14:44.080 --> 14:47.080]  So what it leads me for what I'm trying to say to you guys is when you're
[14:47.080 --> 14:50.080]  buying CBD products, be very leery,
[14:50.080 --> 14:54.080]  be very suspicious of any CBD products right now.
[14:54.080 --> 14:58.080]  You guys try to find out about the company you're purchasing from,
[14:58.080 --> 15:01.080]  try to find out the brand, do some research on the brand,
[15:01.080 --> 15:05.080]  find out where their products come from. Are they coming from America?
[15:05.080 --> 15:08.080]  Are they coming from Canada? Are they coming from the United States?
[15:08.080 --> 15:11.080]  I said that one already. Are they coming from China is what I'm getting at.
[15:11.080 --> 15:12.080]  I didn't want to say China first.
[15:13.080 --> 15:16.080]  If it's coming from China, be afraid. If it's coming from Canada,
[15:16.080 --> 15:19.080]  you're probably okay. If it's coming from America,
[15:19.080 --> 15:21.080]  it's hard to say what you're purchasing.
[15:21.080 --> 15:25.080]  I would recommend you buy your CBD products from a very reputable vendor.
[15:25.080 --> 15:29.080]  We had Giddy up on the podcast recently and he represents CanTech Labs.
[15:29.080 --> 15:31.080]  So I can stand behind that.
[15:31.080 --> 15:34.080]  There are also several other reputable companies out there.
[15:34.080 --> 15:36.080]  I'm not going to throw out a bunch of names because I haven't done any
[15:36.080 --> 15:38.080]  research. And as soon as I say a brand name,
[15:38.080 --> 15:41.080]  especially the two that are on the tip of my tongue, if I say those,
[15:41.080 --> 15:44.080]  I'm going to get 10 emails about why I shouldn't have said them.
[15:44.080 --> 15:48.080]  So I'm not going to say anybody other than our friends at CanTech Labs,
[15:48.080 --> 15:52.080]  because Giddy up was on the show and I've actually seen those products work.
[15:52.080 --> 15:56.080]  Giddy gave me a few samples of their CBD products and I passed them out to
[15:56.080 --> 16:00.080]  people who needed them. And I did watch that product work.
[16:00.080 --> 16:01.080]  I saw it work for somebody.
[16:01.080 --> 16:04.080]  I can't talk too much about it because their employment would probably frown
[16:04.080 --> 16:05.080]  upon their CBD use,
[16:05.080 --> 16:09.080]  but I got to see somebody get relief from a CBD product.
[16:10.080 --> 16:13.080]  So I can recommend that one. It's CanTech Labs.
[16:13.080 --> 16:17.080]  And they're based out of Oklahoma. So big shout out to Giddy up and his crew.
[16:17.080 --> 16:19.080]  Now, another thing I want to talk about is,
[16:19.080 --> 16:24.080]  I wonder what other people are taking that they actually think is CBD.
[16:24.080 --> 16:28.080]  What are they buying? If they're getting their CBD from China,
[16:28.080 --> 16:31.080]  if they're getting like a little vial of tincture or a little medicine bottle
[16:31.080 --> 16:34.080]  filled with some syrup that they think is CBD,
[16:34.080 --> 16:36.080]  I wonder what these people are putting into their bodies.
[16:36.080 --> 16:40.080]  How many people are simply taking doses of fish oil every day?
[16:40.080 --> 16:44.080]  How many people are taking water with little drops of hemp oil in it every day?
[16:44.080 --> 16:47.080]  How many people are paying good money and thinking that they're treating
[16:47.080 --> 16:51.080]  themselves well and treating a condition when they're actually being duped into
[16:51.080 --> 16:55.080]  spending their money on a product that could be causing them more harm.
[16:55.080 --> 16:59.080]  That scares the shit out of me. You guys, even if the CBD isn't real,
[16:59.080 --> 17:02.080]  even if it's just fish oil, that's shitty to do to people.
[17:02.080 --> 17:03.080]  But what else is in there?
[17:03.080 --> 17:08.080]  That's the super shitty part because I'm not going to say that China is unscrupulous.
[17:08.080 --> 17:12.080]  Is that the word? Unscrupulous? Scruple? Yeah. China. I'm not going to,
[17:12.080 --> 17:15.080]  but I mean, they don't care. They're just trying to make some money.
[17:15.080 --> 17:17.080]  They're putting some shit in a bottle and they're putting it in a box.
[17:17.080 --> 17:19.080]  They put a label on it and they ship it off.
[17:19.080 --> 17:22.080]  They have no idea where it ends up or what it's going to do to anybody.
[17:22.080 --> 17:24.080]  They don't give a shit. Well, they got paid.
[17:24.080 --> 17:27.080]  So who knows what they're putting in there?
[17:27.080 --> 17:30.080]  Do you remember a long time ago, Chinese toothpaste was killing people.
[17:31.080 --> 17:35.080]  So imagine like what Chinese CBD might be.
[17:35.080 --> 17:37.080]  All right, you guys, I think I've rambled on long enough about that.
[17:37.080 --> 17:41.080]  Pay attention to where your CBD comes from. Find the source.
[17:41.080 --> 17:44.080]  Find out, learn about the company. Are they a reputable company?
[17:44.080 --> 17:48.080]  Are they a piece of shit company? Find out if they are American, Canadian, Chinese.
[17:48.080 --> 17:51.080]  Who knows where they could be from? Try to find out.
[17:51.080 --> 17:55.080]  Our friend Scotty Real will always remind you, you vote with your dollars, man.
[17:55.080 --> 17:58.080]  So pay attention to where your CBD is coming from.
[17:58.080 --> 18:01.080]  Don't give your money to a company that doesn't give a shit about you.
[18:01.080 --> 18:07.080]  And then do give your money to a company that actually cares and offers a quality product.
[18:07.080 --> 18:09.080]  All right, you guys, I said this was going to be a quick episode.
[18:09.080 --> 18:12.080]  I'm already creeping up on almost 20 minutes.
[18:12.080 --> 18:14.080]  So let's read one quick email.
[18:14.080 --> 18:17.080]  This email says, Hey Jeff, I'm growing in my closet for the first time.
[18:17.080 --> 18:23.080]  And I was listening to a veg podcast of yours talking about turning off the lights and letting the plant sleep.
[18:23.080 --> 18:30.080]  During this time, could I also keep the fan off or is the fan okay to run during that time? Thanks.
[18:30.080 --> 18:32.080]  That's a very good question.
[18:32.080 --> 18:34.080]  I have recommended giving your plants some sleep time.
[18:34.080 --> 18:38.080]  A lot of people like to run the plants with 24 hours of veg light so that they grow.
[18:38.080 --> 18:40.080]  But I think the plants really like some sleep time.
[18:40.080 --> 18:42.080]  They do some processing in the sleep.
[18:42.080 --> 18:44.080]  We're not going to get too much into that because I'm trying to keep this short.
[18:44.080 --> 18:47.080]  Also, roots develop in the dark time.
[18:47.080 --> 18:49.080]  You get a lot of root growth at night.
[18:49.080 --> 18:51.080]  So I think a little bit of dark time is good for the plants.
[18:51.080 --> 18:54.080]  It really encourages them growth and who doesn't want to nap occasionally?
[18:54.080 --> 18:58.080]  Also, it lets your lights cool down, save you some electricity, save you some bulb time.
[18:58.080 --> 18:59.080]  It'll help you out.
[18:59.080 --> 19:05.080]  Now this guy is asking, should I leave the fan off or can I keep that on during the dark cycle?
[19:05.080 --> 19:08.080]  I would leave the fan on during the dark cycle.
[19:08.080 --> 19:11.080]  You want air flow, you're going to get more humidity.
[19:11.080 --> 19:16.080]  As soon as those lights go off, the vapor pressure deficit is going to change in that room.
[19:16.080 --> 19:18.080]  The relative humidity is going to spike.
[19:18.080 --> 19:19.080]  It's going to go crazy in there.
[19:19.080 --> 19:23.080]  You're not in there so you don't notice it, but it happens every time the lights go off.
[19:23.080 --> 19:25.080]  It changes drastically in there.
[19:25.080 --> 19:31.080]  So if you've got that fan in there, that will help prevent any sort of bud mold and powdery mildew.
[19:31.080 --> 19:34.080]  And also those leaves just like to move around.
[19:34.080 --> 19:36.080]  The leaves want to get rustled around all the time.
[19:36.080 --> 19:40.080]  If you're not beating the shit out of the plants with that fan, if it's just a nice rustle,
[19:40.080 --> 19:41.080]  yeah, go ahead and leave that on.
[19:41.080 --> 19:42.080]  I think they will like it.
[19:42.080 --> 19:45.080]  Maybe think about turning it off and on intermittently.
[19:46.080 --> 19:52.080]  Just have it come on for maybe on for 15 minutes, off for 15 minutes, on for 15, off for 15, or something like that.
[19:52.080 --> 19:56.080]  That way, if you've got a couple of leaves, it's always that front row of plants, right?
[19:56.080 --> 19:58.080]  That front row right in front of the fan.
[19:58.080 --> 20:02.080]  The leaves look just a little bit shitty from getting beat up by the fan there, the wind.
[20:02.080 --> 20:06.080]  That's the vapor pressure deficit getting just thrown out of whack by that fan.
[20:06.080 --> 20:08.080]  Maybe don't beat the shit out of them all day.
[20:08.080 --> 20:11.080]  Maybe give them a little bit of a rest so that they can actually function,
[20:11.080 --> 20:13.080]  so that those leaves can do their duty.
[20:13.080 --> 20:18.080]  You can have the vapor pressure deficit correct around those leaves for at least half the day.
[20:20.080 --> 20:24.080]  But yes, if you want to leave that fan on, if it's not too strong, if it's not whipping the shit out of your plants,
[20:24.080 --> 20:27.080]  if it's not causing any problems, yes, leave it on.
[20:27.080 --> 20:31.080]  A little bit of stimulation is not a problem throughout the night cycle for those plants.
[20:32.080 --> 20:33.080]  That was a great question, dude.
[20:33.080 --> 20:34.080]  Thanks for the great email.
