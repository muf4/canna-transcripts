[02:19.200 --> 02:25.200]  Clint and Adam join me. Hang on. All right, guys, we are here. We're hanging out with
[02:25.200 --> 02:28.560]  Clint and Adam. I think everybody knows Adam. He's been here a few times. Clint has been
[02:28.560 --> 02:32.880]  here a couple of times. He was a non-smoker the first few times he was on the show, but
[02:32.880 --> 02:37.960]  now Clint has converted to the dark side. Clint is now a pot smoker. So congratulations.
[02:37.960 --> 02:43.060]  Welcome to the team. Hey, thanks. For you guys that do not know Clint, he is a comedian
[02:43.060 --> 02:47.460]  or an aspiring comedian. He's just a silly open mic-er. That's right. He's actually been
[02:47.460 --> 02:51.940]  hosting the open mic at a local bar called Phil's Radiator. When is that and how has
[02:51.940 --> 02:58.980]  it been going, bro? Every Tuesday. Every Tuesday. Every Tuesday about 9 p.m. and come out. It's
[02:58.980 --> 03:06.080]  just a place to try out new jokes. I think it's great. We've been getting mixed reviews
[03:06.180 --> 03:10.780]  as to who's coming down and stuff, but I think it's starting to blow up. It always takes
[03:10.780 --> 03:16.960]  a little bit to get stuff going in this town. Where is Phil's? Phil's is Pueblo, Colorado,
[03:16.960 --> 03:21.900]  C Street and Union. Yeah, Union and C. Or D, whatever it is down there. Right there.
[03:21.900 --> 03:26.180]  You'll find it. Go downtown. It's the spot with the nice outdoor patio. Do you guys do
[03:26.180 --> 03:30.980]  comedy inside or outside right now? Inside. It's just they got a stage and stuff. Oh,
[03:30.980 --> 03:34.260]  nice. What time do we need to get there to sign up if we want to be on the stage? If
[03:34.260 --> 03:39.760]  you want to come be a comedian, try to get down there by 9. And even then, I'm not going
[03:39.760 --> 03:44.320]  to hold you against the coals if you're a little late. We'll get you on. It's a good
[03:44.320 --> 03:49.680]  time. Have you performed at Phil's yet, Adam? No, I've not performed at Phil's. Not yet.
[03:49.680 --> 03:54.360]  I went down there last week and just saw the show and it's a cool place, man. Cool. Good
[03:54.360 --> 03:59.320]  beer. Adam's got dreams of doing some stand up comedy. He's done a couple of shows. Unfortunately,
[03:59.320 --> 04:04.200]  I didn't make it, but I've heard he's shocking is what I was told. Uh oh.
[04:05.180 --> 04:11.820]  I guess that's better than shitty. Yeah, for sure. It starts with the same letters, though. So
[04:11.820 --> 04:16.460]  they may be in may have been being nice to you, buddy. Hey, no, I've heard what your act is.
[04:16.460 --> 04:21.540]  We're not going to go into it here. If you said that on a show that is shocking, bro. That's big
[04:21.540 --> 04:25.060]  balls. So if you guys want to hear some guy with big balls, talk about funny shit. Go see Adam.
[04:25.060 --> 04:28.700]  The next time he gets his big balls ready to perform somewhere. Oh boy. Yep. Now you got to
[04:28.700 --> 04:33.260]  go do it. Yeah, that's what I got to go do. Phil's radiator. Phil's right. Tuesdays. Tuesdays.
[04:33.900 --> 04:39.100]  9 p.m. It got all like monster truck. Awesome. Bragg Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday,
[04:39.660 --> 04:45.980]  Adam and I and another hot friend. Uh, Monday night. I'm so pumped. Yeah. So it'll be the night
[04:45.980 --> 04:49.580]  that you guys are listening to this show. Probably. We are going to go smoke cannabis
[04:49.580 --> 04:55.180]  with Doug Benson. Yes, we will be getting Doug with high. We're not on the show, but we're going
[04:55.180 --> 05:01.020]  to be doing actually getting high with Doug. Yeah. Yeah. Doug Benson. Fucking lit. Yes. If
[05:01.020 --> 05:05.420]  you guys are listening to this on Monday, this will come out Monday, the 15th. Doug Benson is
[05:05.420 --> 05:11.100]  at Comedy Works in Denver tonight. The last I checked, it was not sold out. Doug Benson is
[05:11.100 --> 05:16.060]  well worth your drive to Denver. Go check it out. I will be there. There will be a smoke session
[05:16.060 --> 05:20.380]  somewhere and it'll be your chance to smoke with Rasta Jeff. It'll be a good time if you show up
[05:20.380 --> 05:25.820]  and Doug Benson, who is fucking hilarious, hilarious. My favorite weed comedian, probably
[05:25.820 --> 05:30.540]  the most popular weed comedian. Oh, definitely. Yeah. I mean, you listen to one of his podcasts
[05:30.540 --> 05:35.980]  almost every weekend and then I watch the the other one just about every week. Yeah. I have
[05:35.980 --> 05:40.380]  two different tastes. You know what I'm saying? But we still we're still right there. Yeah. Doug
[05:40.380 --> 05:44.380]  loves movies is one of my favorite podcasts. Shout out to Doug loves movies. I guess go listen to
[05:44.380 --> 05:47.900]  that one when the show's over. You'll love it. If you're into movies and pop comedy. And then if
[05:47.900 --> 05:53.020]  you only have a few minutes for a podcast, Doug loves minis is great. It's a perfect short little
[05:53.020 --> 05:57.500]  show. I listen to it when I take a shower. He does about 15 minute episodes. It's long enough to
[05:57.500 --> 06:00.540]  throw hit play, jump in the shower, clean your ass, get out and dry off and get dressed. You
[06:00.540 --> 06:05.740]  got about 15 minutes for a guy. Perfect. Yeah. So. All right. So, Doug, we've promoted you.
[06:05.740 --> 06:09.660]  We need you to start promoting us. I was going to say, I just we just went on for like a minute
[06:09.660 --> 06:15.420]  about Doug Benson. We're just pumped. Top of the episode. We've been going to Comedy Works quite a
[06:15.420 --> 06:21.180]  bit. And man, there is nothing like a good show at a good comedy club. That works. Has it freaking
[06:21.180 --> 06:25.420]  correct? You went to we bragged on the show about seeing Joe Rogan. Clint went the night before us
[06:25.420 --> 06:30.940]  and sat front freaking road. Really? I don't know how that happened. They let your hairy ass up
[06:30.940 --> 06:34.780]  there. It was they weren't filming that night. Oh, yeah. They just let us up there. Of course,
[06:34.780 --> 06:40.380]  they wouldn't let my ugly ass up there. When they were filming, they would put decent looking people
[06:40.380 --> 06:46.300]  up front. But then a sexy young lady and a guy showed up and they had no problem telling those
[06:46.300 --> 06:50.220]  people, sorry, you have to move and they would reseach you. And then this girl in like a
[06:50.220 --> 06:55.340]  tangerine or melon colored shirt with giant boobs and a lot of makeup. And you could tell she was
[06:55.340 --> 06:59.340]  going to go out front row and they just walked right up to the front row and put her in the front
[06:59.340 --> 07:05.420]  like they had no problem making people move. Dan Rainey and Matt Chapman were at the show and they
[07:05.580 --> 07:11.820]  got put up towards the front, but then they slowly moved them back to the got moved five times.
[07:11.820 --> 07:18.140]  Jesus, I sat they sat me down. We got to in line kind of early, like maybe 30 minutes before the
[07:18.140 --> 07:23.420]  doors were supposed to open. So we were in line pretty early and that's they just let us in. And
[07:23.420 --> 07:29.740]  then the group ahead of us was like of six dudes and there's only seven front row seats. So like
[07:30.300 --> 07:33.980]  they already had most of that. So they're like, all right, you guys go to the back. And I don't
[07:33.980 --> 07:37.740]  know if it's like an ideology of like, they're going to want to talk more because there's six of
[07:37.740 --> 07:42.220]  them. Yeah. You know, I'm going to be talking louder. There's only two me and my buddy Riley.
[07:42.220 --> 07:46.940]  We go up and we thought, Oh, second row. That'll be cool. And the guy goes, Hey, there's two more
[07:46.940 --> 07:52.140]  front. You guys want front? I go, yeah, I think I do. Yeah. Yeah. And then that's a cool place to
[07:52.140 --> 07:58.460]  be front row. Like I'm really hoping we get there good on Monday. Joe Rogan does a beard joke. And
[07:58.460 --> 08:03.980]  then it felt like it was directed at me. I noticed you guys get that joke too. I don't know.
[08:03.980 --> 08:08.620]  I don't remember the joke. I did not get a beard joke. He did a grateful dead joke. And I felt as
[08:08.620 --> 08:13.180]  if you were staring me directly in my eyes telling this grateful dead joke. And I didn't say that to
[08:13.180 --> 08:16.700]  anybody, but on the ride home, the girl I took with me said, he looked you straight in the face
[08:16.700 --> 08:21.420]  when he said the grateful dead joke. Yeah. He was talking about duck dynasty beards.
[08:21.420 --> 08:27.980]  And he might've mentioned duck dynasty. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. I
[08:27.980 --> 08:33.260]  mimed a part of his joke. Cause I really don't want to give it away. Yeah. Comedy's central here.
[08:33.260 --> 08:39.500]  And not that long. We got to go to that show. Yeah. And I were in the taping, dude. I didn't
[08:39.500 --> 08:44.300]  want to be in the taping. Honestly, I would rather not next time. Yeah. It was stressful. Uh,
[08:44.300 --> 08:48.300]  you couldn't go take a piss and I didn't have to piss, but just telling me that I can't go take a
[08:48.300 --> 08:52.140]  piss and now I have to piss. It's like, you're just like, oh, I can't. Well, suddenly I need
[08:52.140 --> 08:56.060]  to pee. Yeah. Now I'm going to be sitting here. I had to pee the whole time he was on, but I was
[08:56.060 --> 09:00.060]  like, I'm not leaving no food or drink service during the entire show. They came and took our
[09:00.060 --> 09:03.980]  beverages, everything, everything, you know, the comedy works, they have a menu hanging from the
[09:03.980 --> 09:08.220]  chair in front of you. They took that, they took the pen. Uh, they made everybody take off their
[09:08.220 --> 09:13.660]  hats. Yeah. It was a little, no logos. Like I said, they were moving ugly people to the back of
[09:13.660 --> 09:19.740]  the room. Like it was definitely intense. They sent me under a camera. Like the camera was right
[09:19.740 --> 09:23.580]  above my head. That's why, that's why I feel like a couple of the jokes, Joe was looking me in his
[09:23.580 --> 09:27.900]  eyes telling them to me because it gave him right there. Yeah. The camera was above my head and it
[09:27.900 --> 09:31.340]  made it feel instead of talk to that machine, he could just talk to me and it felt a little more
[09:31.340 --> 09:36.380]  natural because I was high and laughing my ass off. Yeah. Yeah. Seeing, I was just laughing. It
[09:36.380 --> 09:41.580]  was a good time. I'm sure we've heard as a fun place, man. Like it's just, yeah, we went for a
[09:41.580 --> 09:45.500]  walk after. Yeah. And, uh, it was fun having, I had a lady friend with me and I had Adam with me
[09:45.500 --> 09:48.780]  and it was fun. Cause a dude walked up and recognized me. He was like, Hey man, are you
[09:48.780 --> 09:52.860]  that guy? I was like, I am Rasta Jeff from iRegenetics. And we talked about seeds and stuff.
[09:53.180 --> 09:57.020]  Did he ever get ahold of you? And you know, I don't think so. Okay. Well, if you're listening
[09:57.020 --> 10:00.780]  out there, brother, Phil was his name. So what's up, Phil? If you haven't contacted me yet, uh,
[10:00.780 --> 10:04.780]  hit me up on Facebook, send me a direct message. I'm taking flyers with me to Denver Monday. I
[10:04.780 --> 10:07.900]  don't care what you say. Okay. All right. We've only got a couple of few left. We may need to go
[10:07.900 --> 10:11.740]  to Kinko's and get some printed. All right. All right. We got five with me. We need to give Tony
[10:11.740 --> 10:14.940]  Hinchcliffe a big shout out. I don't know if we talked about Tony Hinchcliffe on the podcast.
[10:14.940 --> 10:19.020]  We've talked about the Joe Rogan show, but Clint got to go to, so I'm re excited. Yeah.
[10:19.020 --> 10:22.620]  Tony Hinchcliffe nailed it, dude. That is one hell of a comedian. It was really,
[10:22.620 --> 10:27.980]  but you could still see, yes, he's been doing comedy for a while, but you could see, uh,
[10:27.980 --> 10:33.500]  another step when you watch Joe Rogan, not to say that Tony Hinchcliffe wasn't great because that's,
[10:33.500 --> 10:36.700]  that's what I like seeing. I like seeing guys that are better than me. Cause I can go, Oh,
[10:37.340 --> 10:42.140]  I'm not the big fish in the little pond. I'm a little fish in a little pond. Quit being a,
[10:42.140 --> 10:46.300]  like get better. But that's what I get to see. Like when we bring guys down and they're,
[10:46.300 --> 10:50.380]  they've been doing it for like five years, eight years, 10 years, you get to see like,
[10:50.380 --> 10:55.500]  Oh, that's where I want to be. Right. But it was, but seeing Tony Hinchcliffe and I don't know how
[10:55.500 --> 11:00.220]  long he's been telling jokes. I know he's 30. He said, yeah. Um, you listened to the Joe Rogan
[11:00.220 --> 11:07.740]  experience. Well, yeah, that, but he also said it when he was talking about being, did he do his,
[11:07.740 --> 11:13.980]  uh, knit cap bit? Yeah. He was like, I'm a 30 year old man. And then it kept sleeping in it.
[11:14.940 --> 11:23.740]  Yeah. But you're right. Yeah. I listened to him on Tony or on Joe Rogan. Um, but it was, it was,
[11:23.740 --> 11:29.660]  uh, magical dude. I don't know. I just put my fucking shit in the microphone to do that. It's
[11:29.660 --> 11:39.500]  weird. I'm sorry. Um, no, uh, but Tony Hinchcliffe was on par. Yeah, definitely. He's got some really
[11:39.500 --> 11:45.100]  good jokes, but, and I mean, not only that, but you say Joe Rogan killed it. I mean, as a comic
[11:45.820 --> 11:51.100]  to be up there for an hour, Jesus, you know, and I mean, him talked about it afterwards.
[11:51.100 --> 11:56.060]  You know, he was really nervous. You could see the nerves at the first five minutes.
[11:56.060 --> 11:59.900]  I thought so. And a lady heckled him. I heard about that. You told me about that. As soon as
[11:59.900 --> 12:05.100]  she heckled him, he came out of the like nervous thing, went away and he's like, what bitch? And
[12:05.100 --> 12:09.260]  he kind of went off on her for a minute. And when he came back to the set, he was on point from then
[12:09.260 --> 12:14.140]  on. I think that heckler kind of helped him out, kind of helped him. And it brought the crowd in
[12:14.140 --> 12:19.100]  him together before, before that there was a barrier between the performer and the crowd
[12:19.100 --> 12:24.300]  because it was called cameras. Yeah. Yeah. That tension in there affected our laughter and his
[12:24.300 --> 12:30.700]  performance. But once that heckler, all of that, we became one. Yeah. That's a, does Tony Hinchcliffe
[12:30.700 --> 12:35.420]  and you guys can laugh your asses off if you want. Does Tony Hinchcliffe slightly remind you of Inaya
[12:35.420 --> 12:41.980]  Lujan? Yeah. He's got the look, the really mellow calmness. You can't shake him. Nerves of steel.
[12:41.980 --> 12:47.580]  Just kind of feels like his, you know, he's kind of always up here. Yeah. Yeah. And slightly a
[12:47.580 --> 12:54.140]  hipster. I don't, I don't know what I, I looked at him and I, I didn't think that he felt like,
[12:54.140 --> 12:59.500]  like he was having fun. He just like his sense of humor is so like, yeah, it's kind of like this.
[12:59.500 --> 13:04.060]  And so it just, it wasn't, I wish he'd have been having more fun while he was telling his jokes.
[13:04.060 --> 13:07.980]  They did invite him back for a weekend. So we got to pay attention to when Tony Hinchcliffe has
[13:07.980 --> 13:13.180]  come to that. Yeah. I'd love to see, I'd love to see more than how much he probably did. 20 did
[13:13.180 --> 13:17.980]  about 15 when we saw him. I say, yeah. So I'll just talk to comedy. I guess I'm going to keep
[13:17.980 --> 13:23.980]  going. Uh, Sunday night I went to the oddball comedy fest, the oddball comedy tour with Hardwick.
[13:23.980 --> 13:29.100]  Uh, that was amazing. Was he like headlining it? Was he, no, he was actually second Louis CK
[13:29.100 --> 13:33.820]  headlined. There were nine comedians. Uh, I think there were Brody Stevens was the host and he said
[13:33.820 --> 13:37.500]  nine comedians and he must've been one of the performers that he counted. Cause I can't think
[13:37.500 --> 13:42.780]  of who the other, the others were. It was a Brody Stevens, Whitney Cummings, Chris Hardwick,
[13:42.780 --> 13:50.220]  Dimitri Martin, um, Hannibal Buress, uh, Sarah Silverman. I'm going to forget somebody cause
[13:50.220 --> 13:57.260]  I'm on the spot. Mark Marin, uh, did you say Louie already? Somebody. And then Louis CK who was before
[13:58.060 --> 14:03.340]  now, John Rivers. It might've been Joe. That set was quite stale. I'm going to Google it because
[14:03.340 --> 14:12.060]  I feel bad missing somebody on that list. Where's that losing prices. Right. I'm looking for it. I
[14:12.060 --> 14:16.460]  really want to get it right. Cause I feel bad. Um, we'll read the whole list. I mean,
[14:17.020 --> 14:20.700]  Red Rocks seems like I haven't been down there yet, but it definitely, I saw the picture
[14:21.500 --> 14:26.140]  Aziz Ansari is who I'm forgetting. How did you forget Aziz? Whoa. So little.
[14:27.900 --> 14:34.460]  No, Aziz was great. Uh, I think everybody got 15 minutes, but I think Louie may have gotten,
[14:34.460 --> 14:39.020]  it seemed like Louie did 30 minutes. And if you're a comedy fan, uh, we've gone on for a minute,
[14:39.020 --> 14:44.940]  but you'll get this part. Every single second of Louis set was calculated. He knew where to,
[14:44.940 --> 14:50.540]  where to breathe. He knew where to take a couple of steps. I don't think, and I'm not a comedian,
[14:50.540 --> 14:54.460]  but I paid enough attention to you guys. I'm friends with all you comedian guys. And I've
[14:54.460 --> 14:59.580]  paid enough attention to what you say. And so I get it now. And I could feel every minute of him.
[14:59.580 --> 15:05.100]  He crushed it, dude. Always be crushing was Louie's motto that night. He was killing it, dude.
[15:05.100 --> 15:10.220]  On it. I need to see him now. Yeah. Now just, just to see his mannerisms, but you've performed,
[15:10.220 --> 15:15.580]  you know, so it's also performance. You understand like when the singer does it in
[15:15.580 --> 15:20.940]  this note, it sounds a lot better than this note. That's like one octave higher or whatever.
[15:20.940 --> 15:25.340]  Being the drummer. My thing is to play less. If I overplay as a drummer, then you sound like
[15:25.340 --> 15:29.900]  you're insecure when you learn to get older and play less notes. It's when you sound better. And
[15:29.900 --> 15:35.660]  I think Louie has learned each note perfectly. Louie. I, and honestly not to sound like an
[15:35.660 --> 15:39.740]  asshole. He was one of the comedians I was not most excited to see. Yeah. Haven't you seen him
[15:39.740 --> 15:43.660]  before? No, I've never seen Louis CK perform before. I've never seen any of those guys perform
[15:43.660 --> 15:48.860]  live before it was. So I got to see nine of the world's best. Uh, Aziz was good, really high
[15:48.860 --> 15:54.540]  energy, uh, stuck to the same joke basically the whole time. Stol- told like a story with a lot of
[15:54.540 --> 16:00.940]  taglines and a lot of callbacks. So that was cool. Hardwick, I was being, this affects my podcast
[16:00.940 --> 16:06.860]  hosting. Uh, I listened to Nerdist often. Uh, I watch at midnight. Uh, I've followed Hardwick
[16:06.860 --> 16:11.900]  since the freaking, uh, singled out days. So I know he's from Denver. I know how he used to play
[16:11.900 --> 16:17.020]  in a band with Furman called my hardened firm. So they come out, he comes out at red rocks and
[16:17.020 --> 16:21.500]  he puts his hands up in the air in there and he's like red rocks. And I could see the 15 year old
[16:21.500 --> 16:26.460]  boy in him. That's wanted to do that since the first time he touched a guitar. I was like, that
[16:26.460 --> 16:30.540]  was his dream. Just he's, he just clumbed his pants. I could see it. That's fucking awesome.
[16:30.540 --> 16:35.340]  Yeah. And I kind of got to share that with my friend, Chris Hardwick through podcasting and
[16:35.340 --> 16:39.500]  that relationship that I feel that stalker relationship that you feel like you have with
[16:39.500 --> 16:45.100]  all the celebrities. I did feel like that with Joe Rogan. Like I felt like this is my buddy
[16:45.100 --> 16:50.780]  performing and I've known him. And then I wanted to like, as he was walking off the stage, I wanted
[16:50.780 --> 16:56.060]  to shake his hand and stuff. But I was just like, also like he's not a guy, you know? And that's a
[16:56.060 --> 17:01.100]  weird thing to like have this relationship with people that like is a one-sided relationship.
[17:01.100 --> 17:04.780]  Yeah. But I could see that, like, I would probably do the same thing with Hardwick.
[17:04.860 --> 17:09.340]  It's just be like, I felt pride for him. It's like one of my buddies just crushed it at Red
[17:09.340 --> 17:14.380]  Rocks. Cause he was awesome. He did a great, great set. His set was, uh, man, he's kind of a
[17:14.380 --> 17:19.180]  pervert dude. He did, uh, he, he did a joke and I don't want to blow his bit, but half of his bit
[17:19.180 --> 17:23.580]  was about fucking your mom. That's funny. Like, yeah. Yeah. And for Hardwick to go that route at
[17:23.580 --> 17:28.300]  Red Rocks was, it was funny for me. That's pretty great. Uh, Dimitri Martin did his thing. Dimitri
[17:28.300 --> 17:32.940]  Martin. He surprised me how funny he was. My date that I took with me, she loved him. That's who she
[17:32.940 --> 17:38.700]  went to see. So that was good. We got to chuckle at that. Uh, DJ trauma is a killer DJ by the way.
[17:38.700 --> 17:43.420]  He's the one that ran music, uh, between the comedians. And then we took a 15 minute intermission.
[17:43.420 --> 17:47.740]  It was about a 30 minute intermission. I believe if you do comedy for too long, you burn out your
[17:47.740 --> 17:51.660]  funny. Oh yeah. Yeah. So they gave a nice intermission and we stood up and danced for a few.
[17:52.220 --> 17:56.540]  Uh, Hannibal Buress was great. He did his thing. Uh, he made a joke about Colorado having the
[17:56.540 --> 18:02.220]  ugliest crowd. And then he said, it looks like y'all came from a hike. And then he thought about
[18:02.300 --> 18:05.580]  it. He goes, you probably all just did. And then he made a joke about who was the white guy that
[18:05.580 --> 18:09.500]  broke down out here and decided let's build a venue. We can do shows here because Red Rocks
[18:09.500 --> 18:15.260]  is kind of in the middle of nowhere. Yeah. Uh, Louis CK crush. Like I said, Mark Marin was good.
[18:15.260 --> 18:19.820]  His closer was solid, but you could tell he was frazzled and didn't know what to do with 15 minutes.
[18:20.620 --> 18:26.460]  Marin's used to 45 to whittle Marin down to 15 minutes is kind of like, you got to give him time
[18:26.460 --> 18:30.140]  to get out on the stage and sit down at the edge of the stage and get pissed off about something.
[18:30.540 --> 18:35.180]  And then he gets into that Mark Marin thing. He didn't get time for that in his 15. I didn't feel
[18:35.180 --> 18:39.980]  he was good. His closer was hilarious. Like I won't blow anybody's been on purpose, but his
[18:39.980 --> 18:46.700]  closer was great. Sarah Silverman surprised the shit out of me. Uh, her set was great, but she is
[18:46.700 --> 18:53.180]  funny. Like she is naturally funny. You could just tell Whitney Cummings fucking yells her set at you.
[18:53.980 --> 18:59.580]  Like I'm Whitney and my jokes are funny. So you're going to laugh punchline. Oh, like, and it's what
[18:59.580 --> 19:03.820]  it feels like the whole time. It feels like you're being barraged with jokes. She was funny, but it
[19:03.820 --> 19:08.700]  was a bit fucking too much for me. You're just saying the way she delivered them could have been
[19:08.700 --> 19:14.540]  better. She forgot she had a microphone and she had to yell. She was, she was Roman style. Like,
[19:14.540 --> 19:18.620]  and I felt that way about her TV shows. Like when she's on TV, she doesn't feel like she's speaking.
[19:18.620 --> 19:23.660]  She feels like she's over-projecting to me too much. Uh, and then Brody Stevens needs medication.
[19:23.660 --> 19:28.460]  Brody Stevens was the host. Uh, Brody, take your medicine, buddy. I love you. I respect you, dude.
[19:28.460 --> 19:34.220]  You need fucking calm down. Brody Stevens fucking harness that shit, bro. Like, I don't know, man,
[19:34.220 --> 19:37.420]  maybe you smoke too much of that good Colorado weed, but at that show you were fucking losing
[19:37.420 --> 19:42.700]  your fucking shit. Yeah. I'm not, I'm not a huge fan of Brody Stevens. Yeah. It's just not my thing,
[19:42.700 --> 19:48.300]  but personal preference there. Well, it's just like anything. Like I'm, I'm so glad that there's
[19:48.300 --> 19:52.620]  some people that don't like my comedy because if everybody liked it, it'd be like, wow, that was,
[19:52.620 --> 19:57.660]  that was, that's not right. Everybody's as fucked up as me. That doesn't make any sense. Nobody
[19:57.660 --> 20:02.220]  wants another Dane cook. I keep telling my mom that she doesn't want to hear it, but she doesn't
[20:02.220 --> 20:06.940]  fucking listen to me. So your mom's going to come see your comedy. She wants to, that's going to be
[20:06.940 --> 20:11.100]  funny. It's going to be hilarious. I want to tape it. I'm not going to have the camera pointed at
[20:11.100 --> 20:17.180]  you at all. It'll be her reaction the entire time. I haven't, I got, I make sure that nobody's coming
[20:17.180 --> 20:24.300]  to my shows like family wise. Like they don't know when I do stuff that they do terrible. They
[20:24.300 --> 20:28.460]  do now. Yeah. Cause I listened to the, I grow culture podcast Tuesday nights, nine o'clock
[20:28.460 --> 20:33.420]  Phil's radio, downtown Pueblo, Colorado. It's free to get in, right? It's free to get in. Hey,
[20:33.420 --> 20:39.980]  it's free. Any smoking weed. What? What? He's grounded, grounded. You're done. Speaking of
[20:39.980 --> 20:44.300]  smoking weed. This is a podcast about consuming cannabis, growing cannabis and cannabis education.
[20:44.300 --> 20:48.300]  We should probably talk a little bit about cannabis. Got a little ranty, especially,
[20:48.300 --> 20:51.900]  but I think our listeners enjoy getting a little inside of our heads and a little bit of our world
[20:51.900 --> 20:56.300]  and knowing what's up with us. I like, like I said, that Chris Hardwick talk, uh, they're my
[20:56.300 --> 21:00.860]  friends now. They know what I'm doing. They're 29, 30 episodes into being my buddy. We've spent 30
[21:00.860 --> 21:05.580]  hours together now. Absolutely. We're bros and sis is, I guess, what do you call it? We're not,
[21:05.580 --> 21:09.020]  if you're a lady out there, you're my bro. I don't know what else to call you. Right. Family.
[21:09.020 --> 21:11.580]  You're awesome. Thanks for listening to the show. Just as much as all the dudes.
[21:12.220 --> 21:16.540]  I have a female friend who was encouraging me to do an all episode, an episode all about women
[21:16.540 --> 21:21.500]  and cannabis. Um, I don't know what to do. I told her to research it for me and help me out. If you
[21:21.500 --> 21:26.380]  guys have any ideas for women in cannabis, it feels sexist, a guy doing a show all about women
[21:26.380 --> 21:29.980]  and cannabis. So anything I come up with, I feel like it'll be gender biased and it'll be weird.
[21:29.980 --> 21:35.420]  So ladies send me some stuff so that I can do a ladies podcast. I'll, I want to satisfy the
[21:35.420 --> 21:40.780]  listeners. And if you're asking for it, that's what we got to do. I'm ranting again. So women
[21:40.780 --> 21:46.220]  and cannabis. Yeah. That's just the tremors, right? Oh man. So Clint is a comedian. We should
[21:46.220 --> 21:52.540]  remind you. And these are jokes. That one wasn't, I wasn't even going to open my mouth.
[21:52.540 --> 21:56.140]  And what are you going to do about what I know? I'm actually going to give a shout out to miss
[21:56.140 --> 22:00.220]  green thumb, Jessica here, a bad-ass grower. I'll stand up for you. One of my favorite female
[22:00.220 --> 22:05.180]  growers. I was going to say, do you not know any kind of people from Denver that maybe could
[22:05.180 --> 22:10.940]  travel down and you know, Oh yeah, we can get people on the show. Uh, yeah, definitely. But I,
[22:10.940 --> 22:14.300]  we're going to do like an hour and it's easier for, yeah, we'll do a report on it instead of
[22:14.300 --> 22:17.980]  bringing them. But I'll talk to Jess and get some info from her because she's a bad-ass,
[22:17.980 --> 22:23.020]  bad-ass female grower. She grows as good, if not better than myself. I'll give her that credit.
[22:23.020 --> 22:26.700]  She grew some Kong. That was amazing. Follow at miss green thumb on Instagram. I'll find out the
[22:26.700 --> 22:30.860]  proper, uh, the exact Instagram address and I'll tweet that shit out so you guys can follow her.
[22:30.860 --> 22:35.100]  Cause she's a great grower. So Clint came, I had Clint here. Clint is a, he used to be a non-smoker.
[22:35.100 --> 22:39.500]  Now he is a new smoker. It's funny because he took two puffs off of a bowl earlier,
[22:39.980 --> 22:45.180]  dirt weed, and obviously did not come from here. I brought it in myself. I felt bad about it
[22:45.180 --> 22:50.300]  immediately. But, uh, I saw him get plenty high off two good puffs of some, some schwaggle weed.
[22:50.300 --> 22:54.700]  It wasn't really schwaggles, but it was not the day. You smoked it. I mean, it's not,
[22:54.700 --> 23:00.780]  it's not Rasta weed. It's not Irie. It looks similar to that stuff that was in that bag over
[23:00.780 --> 23:04.460]  here the other day. He's on the smoke team now. So, you know, he's joining us and now he's got
[23:04.460 --> 23:09.260]  some questions. I do. One of his main, I wrote down the questions because we got blazed and I
[23:09.260 --> 23:13.260]  didn't want to forget him. And he knew he looked into my eyes and he goes, Clint's not gonna
[23:13.260 --> 23:19.420]  remember anything. Yeah. So one of the questions Clint had was storage. I do. Cause I don't know,
[23:19.420 --> 23:25.020]  you know, I, I, my little bag of weed is my plastic fucking up my weed.
[23:26.620 --> 23:30.300]  Well, I hate to dish your weed that you got now, but that's fine to keep in a sandwich baggie. But
[23:30.300 --> 23:34.140]  when you upgrade and you get some quality weed from somebody that's a good caregiver that likes
[23:34.380 --> 23:39.500]  doesn't want to see you smoking that shit anymore. Keep your little to go portion in a baggie maybe,
[23:39.500 --> 23:44.620]  but keep the rest of it in a jar. I store usually, you know, most people have like a quarter to an
[23:44.620 --> 23:48.380]  ounce of weed, maybe an eighth of weed. I keep it in a glass jar. Your glass jar size can depend
[23:48.380 --> 23:52.460]  on the size of your stash. I use baby food. I was just going to say, Adam uses a baby food
[23:52.460 --> 23:57.580]  jar to keep his weed in. 98 cents. Because if you go to Walmart trying to buy a jar for number one,
[23:57.580 --> 24:03.980]  we live in Colorado and there's no jars. For number two, they're $6 for a jar. That's the
[24:03.980 --> 24:10.620]  same size and the same price, you know? And you get baby food. Yum. Hey, I like peas and carrots.
[24:11.260 --> 24:16.380]  Carrots and peas, peas and carrots. All right. So butchered weed in a jar. Hopefully when you get
[24:16.380 --> 24:21.820]  it, it's not too dry. It's not too wet. Hopefully it's at the right point. If when I dry and cure
[24:21.820 --> 24:25.740]  my own weed, guys, you keep asking for a drying and curing episode. That's coming. Jesse and I
[24:25.740 --> 24:29.340]  are putting that together. We're putting a lot of thought and work into it. That should be episode
[24:29.340 --> 24:32.860]  30 is the drying and curing episode. So be patient. That's coming. You got about a week until that's
[24:32.860 --> 24:37.420]  out. Yeah. Chill out. God. Yeah. Wait your turn. I'm just kidding. Thanks for listening and being
[24:37.420 --> 24:43.900]  patient. If you are listening to this next week, I got a big show coming up September 22nd at
[24:43.900 --> 24:47.900]  Phil's Radiator. We're bringing Ron Babcock through and he's a professional comedian who's
[24:47.900 --> 24:53.020]  been on TV before. Like he's been on HBO. He's been on Comedy Central. Does he do weed jokes?
[24:53.020 --> 24:57.100]  I don't think so. He's in Colorado. He has to. Yeah. He will that night. Well, he's from LA.
[24:57.100 --> 25:01.820]  Three at least. He's coming from LA. He's going to hit Phil's Radiator Monday. It's only $5.
[25:02.780 --> 25:08.140]  Like it's. I'll come down. Yeah. It's the 22nd. It's a good, he's and he's going to do as long
[25:08.140 --> 25:11.660]  as he wants to do. I'm going to do maybe 10 minutes. Paul's going to do 10 minutes. Paul
[25:11.660 --> 25:15.580]  Rosales is really funny. What's up, Paul? Garrett Waller is going to be on that one. Garrett Waller.
[25:15.580 --> 25:20.460]  What's up you giant fucker? Huge, huge jokes. He might guy. Yeah. He might do a fat guy joke.
[25:20.460 --> 25:26.060]  He might, he might not. He will. He will. And then John Bueno's on that as well. Oh,
[25:26.060 --> 25:30.540]  John Bueno. I hope he wears a fancy sweater. Yeah. Yeah. He probably, he looks so good. He
[25:30.540 --> 25:36.460]  was rocking Mr. Rogers last week. He's a fucking killer. I just derailed to plug without asking.
[25:36.460 --> 25:39.980]  And no, that's cool. I caught you doing it. And I like, I like the natural flow of this show.
[25:39.980 --> 25:43.740]  That's what we expect out of Clint. Just ruin the show. That's what we expect out of Clint.
[25:43.740 --> 25:48.860]  I know where we are. Cause I took notes and we let you get nice and high. So you're not
[25:48.860 --> 25:53.420]  going to ruin anything. I'm the captain of this ship. I'm going to start something called the,
[25:54.220 --> 25:58.620]  what, what, what I'm going to start something called the, the, the cuss jar here pretty soon.
[25:58.620 --> 26:03.180]  Every time I say after starting on episode 30, every time I say the word, fuck, I will donate a
[26:03.180 --> 26:07.980]  dollar to a charity. Uh, I had a conversation with the guy on Instagram today and he asked me to
[26:07.980 --> 26:12.860]  donate to a charity and I will find out the charity that he was asking about. And I'll donate a dollar
[26:13.420 --> 26:17.820]  starting on episode 30. Every time I say fuck in a podcast, how about each episode?
[26:19.180 --> 26:23.820]  However many times you say, fuck, you have to donate to a different charity. That way you're
[26:23.820 --> 26:27.500]  spreading it around. Maybe. Well, hopefully I don't say fuck more than like six or seven times.
[26:28.620 --> 26:32.060]  My feelings, because after I start, I'm going to throw down the dollars on the table and watch
[26:32.060 --> 26:35.980]  them happen. So it's going to get expensive. Last one. You only had two, I believe. Yeah.
[26:35.980 --> 26:39.340]  So hopefully I can get to zero and hopefully this guy's charity doesn't get anything out of me.
[26:42.300 --> 26:46.380]  Yeah. I don't care what your charity is. No, I, we had a good conversation. I made a new friend
[26:46.380 --> 26:49.660]  today on Instagram. He started off mad at me by something that I posted and I turned him right
[26:49.660 --> 26:53.260]  around. Once I explained what I meant and made a friend with the guy. So shout out Dr. Green
[26:53.260 --> 26:57.820]  thumbs. It's not, there are so many Dr. Green thumbs on Instagram. I was going to say really
[26:57.820 --> 27:03.820]  now it's a shout out to Instagram, but that dude, uh, I'm going to donate to his charity if I say
[27:03.820 --> 27:09.580]  fuck on episode 30. So anytime after this episode, the F word cost me a dollar. Uh, I'll start to,
[27:09.580 --> 27:13.740]  once I keep screwing up, I will increase my, my value for the F word. Like five or
[27:13.740 --> 27:17.820]  10. We're also not going to keep track. So you have to tell us. Yeah. Cause people,
[27:17.820 --> 27:22.860]  no people tweet me. I actually, no, that's fine. Just we're not going to keep track. So dreadful
[27:22.860 --> 27:26.220]  Jay has been tweeting me. Somebody else has tweeted me. So they remind me I said, like a
[27:26.220 --> 27:31.020]  compilation of you saying fuck over and over. So we've just said fuck like 14 times in the past
[27:31.020 --> 27:35.500]  five minutes. So me and Clint are allowed. You're not. Yeah. I don't remember putting up any money.
[27:35.500 --> 27:39.900]  Maybe I'll make that a guest stipulation too. So maybe we'll all start matching dollars. Every
[27:39.900 --> 27:44.780]  time somebody says it, then we all got to match it. I'm below poverty. Right. You know,
[27:46.060 --> 27:50.700]  just to be a dick too. Clint works at a steel mill. So fuck is in his daily vocabulary. And
[27:50.700 --> 27:55.980]  Adam is from the South and you know, he knows like six words and two of them are fuck.
[27:56.060 --> 27:58.540]  Yeah. And the other one is, yeah. Yeah. Shut up.
[28:01.660 --> 28:05.980]  We're talking about storage. So you're saying baby food containers. Yeah. Baby food. Although
[28:05.980 --> 28:10.780]  that's just what I use. I mean, I literally got tired of going to Walmart and there being none,
[28:10.780 --> 28:13.820]  you know, after you drive to both Walmarts on either side of town and you're like, do I really
[28:13.820 --> 28:19.100]  want to go out to West? No, I just 98 cents. You know, you scoop it out, you clean it out,
[28:19.660 --> 28:25.340]  leave it, let it dry. And then, yeah, it's, it's good in there. And that's, that's perfect for an
[28:25.340 --> 28:28.940]  eighth, you know, especially like a fluffy eight. That's, that's, but you got to wait until you got
[28:28.940 --> 28:32.700]  to make sure your weed's dry enough to go into a jar. I was about to say, that's where I derailed
[28:32.700 --> 28:36.540]  you. I know I'm, I'm on it, bro. I'm getting good at this podcast thing. When my weed, when I'm
[28:36.540 --> 28:40.940]  curing and drying my weed, I'll leave it a little bit extra moist for my personal so that I almost
[28:40.940 --> 28:44.540]  have to open. Yes, I do smoke flowers. Still. People don't believe that I still smoke weed.
[28:44.540 --> 28:48.140]  I do. It's not always dabs, but I'll leave my weed a little moist where I got to open the jar and
[28:48.140 --> 28:51.980]  take the buds out and set them down for 10 or 20 minutes before I can actually roll a joint with it.
[28:52.860 --> 28:56.780]  That's just my personal. If it's a production crop for my patients, I'm a caregiver and the
[28:56.780 --> 29:01.340]  herb that's going to get delivered to a guy later on tonight. That stuff's dry. It's been cured and
[29:01.340 --> 29:05.740]  it's dry. It's ready to go into his jar. He'll keep, he's getting a half. So it's probably going
[29:05.740 --> 29:10.060]  to go in a Mason jar. It'll be sealed up and he'll just, he'll probably pull out a little baby food
[29:10.060 --> 29:14.140]  jar worth for himself every couple of days when he needs it. And he hides the Mason jar away from
[29:14.140 --> 29:19.020]  the family and has that in a safe place and keeps his jar in his pocket. And that will also, if your
[29:19.020 --> 29:25.100]  weed is really dry, that may bring back some of the moisture in the Christmas. Good topic. If your
[29:25.100 --> 29:29.260]  weed's really dry, I see a lot of people trying to put fruit and shit in there. Don't do that.
[29:29.260 --> 29:33.660]  You're going to bring pathogens and molds. It doesn't take a lot of moisture to start molding
[29:33.660 --> 29:38.220]  up a jar if you leave it in there long enough. This company does not pay me shit, but I do highly
[29:38.220 --> 29:44.860]  recommend a Boveda or a Boveda Humidipak. It's a great product. If your weed's a little bit too dry
[29:44.860 --> 29:49.980]  or a little too moist, even you put the proper Boveda Humidipak in with your herbs and it will
[29:49.980 --> 29:57.100]  properly moisten your herb to the moisture content that is desired. Isn't it like 67 or whatever?
[29:57.100 --> 30:01.180]  I don't remember exactly. It's one of those numbers. I'll go to the Boveda website right now.
[30:01.180 --> 30:07.180]  And it's one of those numbers. I've seen it around. It's how much? It's the humidity, the perfect
[30:07.740 --> 30:13.180]  humidity should be around 67 or 76. It's somewhere in between there. I got you. It's like the same
[30:13.180 --> 30:17.980]  thing as a humidor. And then there's also, yeah, well, exactly. There are humidors for marijuana
[30:17.980 --> 30:20.700]  specifically. I'm not going to mention the name because I don't want to give them a plug either,
[30:20.700 --> 30:28.620]  but they're shiny metal. They're cans. They got a blocking seal to them. And they come in all
[30:28.620 --> 30:34.540]  shapes and sizes. That's if you're the high roller, you're the pro. I see people use them
[30:34.540 --> 30:41.100]  to transport cannabis for the cannabis cups and stuff like that. They'll basically have four or
[30:41.100 --> 30:47.260]  five of the big pound storage ones. And there's three of them in a backpack and they're loading,
[30:47.260 --> 30:54.140]  getting on an airplane. And it's completely, no one ever knows because it's completely sealed.
[30:55.020 --> 30:59.260]  Still scary as fuck. And then that has your package, your humidifier package that he's
[30:59.260 --> 31:07.180]  talking about that keeps it all at the same humidity. It doesn't really tell you what it
[31:07.180 --> 31:12.620]  keeps it at. It says that it keeps it within a certain range of ambient humidity. So yeah.
[31:13.420 --> 31:16.700]  They have so many products out. I didn't know they had so much stuff. So you guys go check out
[31:16.700 --> 31:21.020]  the Boveda website, Boveda. Shout out to Coral Reefer. She's actually the one that introduced
[31:21.020 --> 31:27.100]  me to the Boveda products. You're a big fan of the Coral Reefer over there, buddy? Go on.
[31:29.900 --> 31:34.380]  All right. So if you're going to keep your weed longer than, if you've got some herb that is dried
[31:34.380 --> 31:38.860]  and cured and you know, it's not moist enough, somebody hates the word moist. A lot of people
[31:38.860 --> 31:43.100]  hate the word moist. You know, your weed is- Why would they hate the word moist?
[31:43.100 --> 31:46.140]  You know? So if your weed's not too damp and you're not afraid to get mold in it,
[31:46.140 --> 31:51.420]  you can put your herb in a vacuum sealer bag and vacuum seal that shit. Vacuum sealers aren't too
[31:51.420 --> 31:57.020]  expensive. The bags aren't too expensive. Seal it up, label it, mark it. Some people, DJ Short
[31:57.020 --> 32:00.700]  says to put it in the freezer at this point. That's what my dad always did. He'd put it in a
[32:00.700 --> 32:05.420]  brown paper bag and then stick it, put it in a bag, put it in a brown paper bag and stick it in
[32:05.420 --> 32:08.780]  the freezer because that way none of the light would get into the brown paper bag. So I was
[32:08.780 --> 32:12.140]  going to say that also. Keep your jars and stuff in a dark place when you're not smoking them if
[32:12.140 --> 32:16.140]  you have the opportunity or if you can get an opaque jar to keep the lights out. A large quantity.
[32:16.140 --> 32:20.620]  You know, if it's an eighth or a quarter, you're good. Yeah. If you've got an ounce or a quarter
[32:20.620 --> 32:24.220]  pound, keep that out of the light. You want that- Right on. I feel really good about that
[32:24.220 --> 32:30.540]  question now. That took a lot longer than I was thinking it would. What about in jars? You keep
[32:30.540 --> 32:35.180]  stuff in jars for longer than I do, obviously. So would you go in there once a month and kind of
[32:35.180 --> 32:39.660]  dump it out? No. Once I feel like we're going to do a whole episode about drying and curing. Once
[32:39.660 --> 32:43.660]  that process is ended, once drying and curing is done, you can put it in your jars and just leave
[32:43.660 --> 32:47.820]  it. It's almost better to leave it because every time you open it, you're introducing oxygen and
[32:47.820 --> 32:52.700]  you're changing the gases that are in the plants. The plants are actually releasing ammonias and
[32:52.700 --> 32:57.180]  chlorophylls. I haven't studied for this part, so I'm going to say wrong shit and a lot of people
[32:57.180 --> 33:01.660]  are going to correct me. But they're releasing gases inside of there and you're exchanging those
[33:01.660 --> 33:07.420]  gases. And if you quit introducing more gases, the decarboxylation and the changes will stop
[33:07.420 --> 33:11.500]  happening. Starches will quit becoming sugars. Everything will stay right where it is. It's like
[33:11.500 --> 33:17.340]  opening a food product. You get it just gets stale eventually because the change, same thing will
[33:17.340 --> 33:21.340]  pretty much happen with your weed. Yeah. I've talked about this on the show before. I like
[33:21.340 --> 33:27.180]  mine a little bit drier because I put mine through a grinder and still get the keef off of the bud
[33:27.180 --> 33:33.260]  onto my grinder. So I like it when I bring it home. I'll sit it in the jar and just leave
[33:33.260 --> 33:39.020]  the lid half on, half off for 12 hours and then put the lid back on. It's still moist
[33:39.020 --> 33:45.420]  inside the bud a little bit, but that outer stuff is flakier and I get dry. I like it a little
[33:45.420 --> 33:48.940]  more sticky. You get a little more flavor out of it when it's a little stickier.
[33:49.580 --> 33:52.620]  You don't let it dry out so much. It's stinging. Your joint burns a little bit better.
[33:53.340 --> 33:57.820]  There you go. I grow culture. You got a question answered. Clint came over and asked a great
[33:57.820 --> 34:02.380]  freaking question after he got high. That was nice. Yeah. He also asked since he's a new smoker,
[34:03.580 --> 34:07.340]  he asked, so I hope we wrap that up. How to store your weed. Put it in a jar. Baggies are cool,
[34:07.340 --> 34:10.700]  but the baggy has a static electricity and it's stealing all your shit and all your shit's
[34:10.700 --> 34:15.740]  sticking to it. So keep it in a jar, a nug jug of some sort. If you have to be sneaky, they
[34:16.300 --> 34:22.860]  skunk proof bags that are smell proof. They also at hydro Pueblo, they offer a duffel bag style bag
[34:22.860 --> 34:28.140]  and a backpack that they claim is smell proof. I have not tested it by putting any products in it,
[34:28.780 --> 34:32.380]  but they claim such and they're, they're decently priced. So if they work, that's worth it.
[34:32.380 --> 34:36.540]  There's also stash cans and things like that that you can get, you know? Yeah, of course you've seen
[34:36.540 --> 34:41.260]  them. Yeah. But that's hiding. That's more being secretive here. I'm not really looking to keep
[34:41.260 --> 34:46.220]  it secret. I can keep it. Well, you already got it like a little case. That's that's all. Yeah,
[34:46.220 --> 34:50.380]  you're doing good. We saw what you're working with. Yeah. So his next question was a normal
[34:50.380 --> 34:56.140]  new guy question. How am I going to pass my P test? Working sucks, right? Everybody?
[34:56.140 --> 34:59.820]  Yes. Working for guys. Guys, you're with me ladies. You listening?
[35:02.060 --> 35:07.420]  Working sucks. If you guys want to tweet all that, uh, that stuff at, at tall Clint and that
[35:07.500 --> 35:12.460]  not at I grow culture, you can go ahead and send your comments to at tall Clint ladies.
[35:13.820 --> 35:22.220]  No, I meant, no, I get you watch us work. Um, anyway, work sucks, but I like my job.
[35:22.220 --> 35:28.940]  Unfortunately, my job does not like people that smoke marijuana and it sucks because I like my
[35:28.940 --> 35:36.220]  job and if I could quit, I would, but it's just, gotta eat life's expensive. I got, I got, I got
[35:36.220 --> 35:44.220]  three women asking me for money all the time and I got a family, but I'm too, um, no, it's
[35:45.980 --> 35:49.580]  just cracking up here. If you want to, if you want somebody to come crash your podcast,
[35:49.580 --> 35:55.820]  invite a comedian, just destroy this. I love it. Anyway, we need to loosen up and have more fun on
[35:55.820 --> 35:59.180]  this show. It's always been real tight reading news today on the news. There was weed stuff.
[36:00.620 --> 36:03.580]  I like that. We've got somebody here to just, what's that character's name? I don't know,
[36:03.660 --> 36:07.180]  but he was good. He needs to stick around. Let me ask you this. Are you worried about
[36:07.180 --> 36:11.260]  them popping random drug tests or are you worried about getting hurt and them
[36:11.260 --> 36:15.340]  wanting you to pee in a cup for workers? Those are the two times that I can get
[36:15.900 --> 36:23.500]  UAs. They, I mean like randoms are, I don't know that anybody that's coming from a weed smoker
[36:23.500 --> 36:28.460]  that's dealt with this, you know, time and time again, randoms, it's just the dice that you're
[36:28.460 --> 36:34.620]  rolling. I've got a solution. This is the IRI genetics only surefire way that I think I know
[36:34.620 --> 36:38.380]  how to get past a drug test that has worked for me multiple times when I was a heavy smoker.
[36:39.180 --> 36:45.660]  Uh, I actually went 63 days without smoking cannabis at one point and took a pee test. I was
[36:45.660 --> 36:49.900]  trying to get a bad-ass job. I was promised a killer job 63 days and could not pass. I was
[36:49.900 --> 36:55.100]  still hot. I was drinking cranberry juice. I was killing the water. Still had a pee test. My family
[36:55.180 --> 36:57.980]  was mad at me. Like you fucked it up. You've been smoking pot. And I was like, honestly,
[36:57.980 --> 37:01.740]  I went to reggae on the rocks and didn't smoke weed. Like I quit from the 4th of July. I puffed
[37:01.740 --> 37:06.380]  down and then for 90 days after that, or 63 days after that, I didn't smoke and still could not get
[37:06.380 --> 37:10.940]  this job that I wanted. And I told them, I was like, I haven't smoked in 65, 63 days. And they're
[37:10.940 --> 37:14.060]  like, sorry, you still didn't. I was like, can you give me 30 more days? And they were already
[37:14.060 --> 37:19.100]  hiring for the position. So it was gone. But so the next time I needed to take a pee test,
[37:19.100 --> 37:27.100]  I could not risk my pee even going in the cup, honestly. So your best bet is to use fake piss
[37:27.100 --> 37:32.940]  because they are not checking for fake piss or piss. They're looking for THC, crystal meth,
[37:32.940 --> 37:36.860]  opiates, ecstasy, whatever. In our case, hopefully guys, if you're listening to my show,
[37:36.860 --> 37:40.860]  hopefully the only thing they're going to find in your pee is some fucking medicine, some cannabis,
[37:40.860 --> 37:47.180]  but that's not my spot to judge. So they sell a product that is straight up fake piss. It is
[37:47.180 --> 37:50.860]  designed to be fake piss. It's usually at some kind of a head shop around here. There's a couple
[37:50.860 --> 37:54.860]  spots you can go. You guys all know where they are if you live around here. Yeah. Yeah. There's
[37:54.860 --> 37:57.660]  two spots. I don't endorse either one of them. They got to work out a sponsorship if they want
[37:57.660 --> 38:04.140]  me to say their names. Yeah. Start paying us, Mr. Money. So you go there and you get this fake pee
[38:04.140 --> 38:08.620]  and it's got a thermometer on the side of the container. The bottle has a thermometer on it.
[38:08.620 --> 38:13.980]  It should come with a, it's a glove warmer for the winter. You crack the thing open and you put
[38:13.980 --> 38:17.580]  your glove, put it in your gloves and it warms your hands in the winter. It comes with one of
[38:17.580 --> 38:23.660]  those. If it doesn't, you got to go buy one. So what I do, this is how I sure fire past more than
[38:23.660 --> 38:28.300]  one drug test. I get this product and I microwaved it for seven seconds in my microwave and that made
[38:28.300 --> 38:34.540]  it a little too hot. So I took a sock and I cut the sock off and I stapled it to the inside of my
[38:34.540 --> 38:39.660]  boxers to where it looked like it was my dick swinging. I put that a warmed up bottle of
[38:39.660 --> 38:45.980]  microwaved fake piss in the sock. Um, I could tell that it was going to be warm enough. I went
[38:45.980 --> 38:49.820]  too long in the microwave. The thing got down. You need it between 96 and a hundred degrees is
[38:49.820 --> 38:53.980]  where you need it to get that to your body is. So I let it cool down. You got to let me intervene
[38:53.980 --> 39:01.420]  here. I just use the heater in the car and in a plastic bag in my boxer line, you know, it's not
[39:01.420 --> 39:06.700]  probation. It's not jail. No one should be watching you piss. They should be going, they
[39:06.700 --> 39:11.020]  should be taking you to a lab and you should be going into a closed area where you can pull out
[39:11.020 --> 39:15.340]  your dick and go, woo. Right. But they wash your hands and check your pockets. Well, that's what
[39:15.340 --> 39:20.220]  I'm saying in the box. Yeah. So, so I got this swinging, swinging sock with a fake pee in it.
[39:20.220 --> 39:23.260]  That's been microwaved and I've let it cool. Now I've driven around long enough to let it get to
[39:23.260 --> 39:26.940]  the right temperature because you got so much time to get there. Hopefully if you're, you're a union
[39:26.940 --> 39:30.540]  worker, I would assume they're going to send you to a lab. You're going to get a couple of minutes
[39:30.540 --> 39:34.460]  work. You get, yeah, you get a couple of minutes to go drive by the house or seven 11 even and hit
[39:34.460 --> 39:38.620]  the, I got to piss and run into seven 11 and use their microwave or a crack, have that. So you're
[39:38.620 --> 39:42.140]  going to, if you're working a job where you might get pete tested, you need this shit in your locker
[39:42.140 --> 39:46.620]  or in your truck or somewhere close. If you can carry this fake piss in your cigarette pack,
[39:46.620 --> 39:50.860]  you're a fucking genius. It's a small bottle. You don't need a lot. It's a little tiny bottle.
[39:50.860 --> 39:55.500]  So you got fake pee, keep it in your shirt pocket, do something. So you get hit with this pete test.
[39:55.500 --> 39:59.500]  You go, you're driving. Maybe they take another car to drive you to the gas station and say,
[39:59.500 --> 40:02.220]  I got to pee, man. Or can we stop and get a pack of cigarettes, go in there and hit that
[40:02.220 --> 40:05.020]  microwave for seven seconds. Do whatever you got to do to warm that piss up to the proper
[40:05.020 --> 40:09.100]  temperature. If you got that glove cracker, use that, wrap it around it, put a rubber band around
[40:09.100 --> 40:12.540]  it, put it between your legs and squeeze. When you feel your legs getting too warm,
[40:12.540 --> 40:16.700]  that shit's probably right at the right temperature. Yeah. So, and you got that
[40:16.700 --> 40:21.020]  little bottle. It's tucked inside of a sock. It's strapped inside your boxers, girls, you're going
[40:21.020 --> 40:23.420]  to have to modify. I don't know what you're going to do. You're going to look like you got a dick.
[40:23.420 --> 40:29.020]  If you follow my method, maybe it'll help you out. Don't wear a skirt or, or do, or do so,
[40:29.660 --> 40:33.340]  pull out this little bottle and just stick it out of the pee hole. You're flying, stick your hand in
[40:33.340 --> 40:36.060]  there and stick your thumb out. So it's like your dick, because if they're standing behind you or
[40:36.060 --> 40:38.940]  something, you're going to have to be smooth and stick your thumb out, make that look like your
[40:38.940 --> 40:43.660]  dong fart. Uh, always fart during a P test. If someone's watching, that's just mandatory.
[40:44.780 --> 40:49.820]  Fart do that. So, uh, I squeezed the bottle the first time I did it into the little sample cup
[40:49.820 --> 40:54.620]  and it went when I let go of it, cause it tried to suck in more air. So tip it up so that you
[40:54.620 --> 40:58.780]  don't make a bong sound when you're fucking doing that or fart right at that point. If you can time
[40:58.780 --> 41:03.580]  it, you got to be careful. So, and then stick that thing, close it back up, screw the cap on,
[41:03.580 --> 41:07.020]  stick it back in your underwear. Fucking don't wash your hands, leave the cup there like you're
[41:07.020 --> 41:10.300]  supposed to and hope that you just put enough of the right temperature fake piss in there. So that
[41:10.300 --> 41:15.660]  fake piss worked for me more than once. I don't know. Yeah. Fake piss. Don't trust my friend.
[41:15.660 --> 41:19.420]  I won't say his name. He had his girlfriend pee in the cup and that's how they found out that
[41:19.420 --> 41:27.260]  my buddy was pregnant. Yeah. Yeah. Um, definitely don't use females piss, but I have,
[41:28.220 --> 41:33.900]  I've never used my own piss ever. He's got kids. I don't even want to ask any questions.
[41:33.900 --> 41:37.820]  Yeah. So we're not trying to mask it. We're trying to replace it. Yeah. Cause they're not looking.
[41:37.820 --> 41:40.940]  Yeah. There's plenty of things you can drink, eat or whatever to take. And all they've done
[41:40.940 --> 41:44.700]  is upset my stomach and give me diarrhea. And by the time you get to the lab, you got a piece so
[41:44.700 --> 41:48.860]  bad that your pee is clear and they go, Oh, this is diluted. We can't even test it. Yeah. Yeah.
[41:49.580 --> 41:55.260]  Yeah. Yep. So if it comes through you and if you smoke like Adam and I do, uh, I dab at least a
[41:55.260 --> 42:02.700]  half a gram a day, a day. You could honestly probably quit for 15 days and you would be fine,
[42:02.700 --> 42:07.820]  but don't, you know, it's technically 30 days. The thing is, is I don't want to quit smoking
[42:07.820 --> 42:12.620]  weed though. And I'm, and it's just a random that's going to come up, you know? And so
[42:12.620 --> 42:16.300]  I don't want to quit. If I wanted to quit, I wouldn't have started. Then you should,
[42:16.300 --> 42:19.340]  you should definitely get prepared. I mean, that's, that's one of the best,
[42:19.340 --> 42:23.660]  best options that I've heard. And then I would just keep hand warmers on the ready. Like I'd
[42:23.660 --> 42:28.060]  start wearing shirts with pockets and like, you know, don't touch me. You know,
[42:30.460 --> 42:33.340]  one day you're standing there talking to your boss. There's this big,
[42:34.620 --> 42:40.380]  are you lactating? My pocket protector is not working today, but nipple Pete all over me.
[42:41.980 --> 42:45.500]  That's awkward. There's gotta be a joke there. Oh, there's definitely a joke there. Yeah. But
[42:45.500 --> 42:49.820]  I don't take your jokes. All right, good. Don't take my jokes. I wouldn't tell it anyways. I like
[42:49.820 --> 42:55.660]  your jokes. That's why I'm not going to use them. Anyways, we've gone a 40 minutes, 41 minutes. You
[42:55.660 --> 42:58.700]  guys want to, uh, you want to do one more question or you just want to answer one more question? I
[42:58.700 --> 43:02.780]  got one more, but I bet we could go on for quite a while about it. If we do it, it'll kind of make
[43:02.780 --> 43:09.260]  it a long question. I want to know what it's about. Well, the question was, what kind of lights are
[43:09.260 --> 43:14.380]  you using for each phase of growing? All right. That could be really long or it could be really
[43:14.460 --> 43:20.220]  simple. Yeah. So quick rundown. I've been doing, Oh guys, I've no, I, I know I started off doing a
[43:20.220 --> 43:23.820]  bunch of grow lessons and we got sidetracked because Jesse came over and started doing outdoor
[43:23.820 --> 43:27.740]  grow stuff. Uh, we started talking about all kinds of other stuff. We kind of lost track of the grow
[43:27.740 --> 43:31.020]  lessons. I promise to get you caught up on those. There's just so much shit going on that it's hard
[43:31.020 --> 43:35.980]  to even catch up. We get sidetracked just stay tuned busy season. It's such a great year to do
[43:35.980 --> 43:40.140]  a podcast. There's been so much cannabis news and stuff to talk about. That's true. It is a busy
[43:40.140 --> 43:44.140]  season. Yeah. Uh, Jesse will be here in a couple of days and we're going to work on finishing up
[43:44.140 --> 43:49.340]  the, uh, uh, drying and curing episodes. So that'll definitely be fun. But what kind of lights
[43:49.340 --> 43:54.620]  do I use? That's where I was, uh, for seedlings and stuff. That's just starting simple. T fives
[43:54.620 --> 43:59.900]  are fine. Um, a lot of guys, fluorescence, correct? Yeah. Yeah. Fluorescence T five fluorescence, uh,
[43:59.900 --> 44:03.580]  T fives are the little skinny bulbs. So they name them T fives are the skinny ones and T eights are
[44:03.580 --> 44:07.660]  the bigger ones. That's just what size they are. Uh, so I keep my seedlings and my clones under
[44:07.660 --> 44:12.380]  T fives until they're good and rooted. Um, depending on which room they're going and what
[44:12.380 --> 44:15.660]  I'm trying to do with them, sometimes they'll stay under T fives until flower. If I'm just
[44:15.660 --> 44:20.060]  doing a three gallon pot of a little plant. And the reason why you run T fives is not only because
[44:20.060 --> 44:23.980]  of the heat, but because it's, you can get them closer to the plant, right? You can put them right
[44:23.980 --> 44:27.660]  on the plant and they're more energy efficient than a big light. And I don't think that the
[44:27.660 --> 44:31.340]  plant really needs a thousand watt light when it's a baby, you can just give it enough just to end
[44:31.340 --> 44:35.340]  that spectrum. They sell two different color bulbs. If you get the blue ones, uh, those keep your
[44:35.340 --> 44:39.820]  plant short and squat. Uh, and that's what we want for veg. And until your plants are two and a half,
[44:39.820 --> 44:42.780]  three feet tall, that's plenty of light. Don't keep them too crowded in there. Give them plenty
[44:42.780 --> 44:47.340]  of space with the T fives, but yeah, it's definitely helpful. I've seen people flower
[44:47.340 --> 44:51.980]  with T fives. I have to, uh, it's not impressive, but if you're in Tennessee where you're not
[44:51.980 --> 44:55.100]  supposed to be growing weed and you can't get a big light bill, that's going to be better than
[44:55.100 --> 44:59.260]  buying weed off of some dude on the street. And I've seen some people grow some pretty dang stuff,
[44:59.260 --> 45:04.140]  you know, with it. Um, so to start, I like the, uh, the T fives, uh, once they get a little bit
[45:04.140 --> 45:09.340]  larger, I will throw them under, uh, I go straight to the thousand watt metal halide for vegging.
[45:09.820 --> 45:13.660]  Uh, I've got a nice bedroom with thousand watt metal halides in there. Keep them kind of close
[45:13.660 --> 45:18.700]  to the plants. Uh, the hortalux, uh, I think it's the blue. I forget which one they make for it's
[45:18.700 --> 45:23.740]  the hortalux lights. They make for vegging the blue one. That's awesome for vegging. Uh, hortalux
[45:23.740 --> 45:27.820]  makes a high pressure sodium that is red. Uh, that's super awesome for flowering. I like to
[45:27.820 --> 45:34.140]  switch to that now with your, when you step from the T fives to the bigger lights, uh, how, just
[45:34.140 --> 45:39.580]  give us a range on like how far you want to keep them, you know, as far as close as you can get
[45:39.580 --> 45:44.460]  them within, uh, you don't want them, you don't, you kind of want to get them as close as you can
[45:44.460 --> 45:50.860]  without burning the plants, but there is a range around a thousand watt light bulb that is unusable
[45:50.860 --> 45:54.620]  light for the plant. It's just too intense and it's the wrong spectrum. So you have to back up
[45:54.620 --> 46:00.620]  about a foot and a half, two feet from the bulb is probably your best bet, but only the tops of
[46:00.620 --> 46:04.060]  your plants are up there. So the bottoms of your plants, you got to, there's a lot of factors to
[46:04.060 --> 46:07.980]  keep in there, but about a foot, 18 inches to a foot is probably about as close as you really want
[46:07.980 --> 46:11.900]  to get. Unless you've got some amazing cooling, you know, if you've got really well ducted and
[46:11.900 --> 46:17.500]  ventilated lights, then you can get them 10, eight inches. But sometimes that, that burst of light
[46:17.500 --> 46:22.300]  coming right out of there, isn't what the plants really want that will kind of stress the plants
[46:22.300 --> 46:26.540]  and change the flavors and kind of do a few things that if you want a certain effect, that's how I
[46:26.540 --> 46:31.580]  achieve one effect when I'm trying to do something is light stress the plan a little bit, but I don't
[46:31.580 --> 46:37.420]  want to tell too much about that. So I'm vegging under the T fives. I'm moving to the, uh, metal
[46:37.420 --> 46:41.900]  halides. And then I go to high pressure sodiums to finish a long time ago. I tried an experiment
[46:41.900 --> 46:46.220]  using high pressure, sodiums and metal halides. And I honestly get the best flavors using a mixture.
[46:46.780 --> 46:52.780]  Um, the different spectrums. Yeah. Yeah. Using like, uh, I got four, uh, high pressure sodiums
[46:52.780 --> 46:56.700]  with, uh, with a one metal halide right in the middle of the room. And all the plants in the
[46:56.700 --> 47:01.260]  middle of the room were a little more dense, had a little more flavor. Uh, I learned that by running,
[47:01.260 --> 47:05.660]  uh, the old reflector called the grow Zilla. It holds two bulbs. I put a 600, uh, sodium and a
[47:05.660 --> 47:10.300]  400 halide in there and everything in that little tester hut came out dank. Some of the pictures of
[47:10.300 --> 47:14.380]  headband on my Facebook are actually from that hut. It was amazing. Yeah. I've seen those pictures.
[47:15.260 --> 47:20.780]  Super dank. Is that his headband yours? I did not make it. No. Okay. Sorry. Trying to plug your
[47:20.780 --> 47:26.300]  shit. Well, nice try. Um, uh, actually I got to talk to dr. Dank today or mr. Dank today,
[47:26.300 --> 47:30.460]  the creator of the golden goat. We had a little conversation on Facebook. That was kind of nice
[47:30.460 --> 47:33.820]  because I did not create golden goat. A lot of people try to give me credit for that. Mr. Dank
[47:33.820 --> 47:38.060]  created golden goat. I simply put it into seed. Uh, I have feminine, I reversed a female, made a
[47:38.060 --> 47:42.620]  male out of it and put the pollen on another female and I made seeds out of it. Yes. So it's a,
[47:42.620 --> 47:46.860]  it's a dank cut. So I made seeds out of the golden goat. If you guys want to give credit to the guy
[47:46.860 --> 47:51.740]  that made it, thank mr. Dank. He did that. Not me. Uh, thanks mr. Dank for letting me use it. He
[47:51.740 --> 47:55.740]  actually gave me permission to put it into seed and he said all he wants is seed though. Yeah.
[47:55.740 --> 47:59.420]  Yeah. There you go. I thought everybody deserved good genetics. That's part of why I started making
[47:59.420 --> 48:07.100]  seeds. So, uh, I usually do fluorescence, halide, sodiums. A lot of people will ask about leds. I
[48:07.100 --> 48:13.100]  used to knock an led light, but my friend Nancy kills it. She is killing it with that bounty
[48:13.100 --> 48:19.100]  killer. Yeah. Yeah. She's running Capleton too. And they both look frosty and dank and all,
[48:19.100 --> 48:22.940]  pretty much all of her stuff is on. I was just about to say she's running a lot of stuff that's
[48:22.940 --> 48:28.540]  from other growers. Not even me. That looks amazing. Just as well. Uh, what's the one that
[48:28.540 --> 48:34.380]  she's got? Is it DB Cooper? That's just giant nugs. It looks really nice. Yeah. Yeah. Nancy's
[48:34.380 --> 48:39.660]  doing a great job with the grows. Shout out Nancy. Well, talking about women growers, you know,
[48:39.660 --> 48:43.500]  I mean, you can always get her to write something a little, yeah, I'm going to make a note of that.
[48:43.500 --> 48:48.220]  She's probably a well-spoken individual that could probably, you know, put a paragraph in that you
[48:48.220 --> 48:52.620]  could read. Yeah, there we go. Support those women growers for sure. I don't care what Clint
[48:52.620 --> 48:57.500]  says. Hey, I was just making a joke. I like that. You got to have an approach as a comedian. And
[48:57.500 --> 49:02.620]  one time Clint told me go on the chauvinist route and I believed him. I got a little
[49:02.620 --> 49:07.900]  misogynistic. Yeah. There was no, uh, no denying that you were good at it. Oh, it's, it's the,
[49:07.900 --> 49:12.780]  it's really easy. And that's why I don't like it. Yeah. It's because it's for me, it's easy to write
[49:12.780 --> 49:20.140]  those jokes. Yeah. It's not fun. It's just not fun. It's just an easy target. I'm saying women
[49:20.140 --> 49:24.940]  are easy targets. That was the, uh, I'm staring into my computer. Like how do I fix this?
[49:26.700 --> 49:32.220]  I just took it this direction almost on purpose. Anyway. Yeah. Yeah. All right guys. Uh, you guys
[49:32.220 --> 49:36.140]  got any, uh, I'm going to let Clint do some plugs. Clint has a lot of shit to plug. Tell us about
[49:36.140 --> 49:39.660]  your Facebook, your Instagram, your shows. How do we call you to cuss you out? Or do we email you
[49:39.660 --> 49:45.100]  to send you hate mail? Yeah. Um, best way to get ahold of me is probably Facebook or Twitter. Find
[49:45.100 --> 49:51.580]  me on Twitter. It's at tall Clint and, uh, Facebook find the wild cousins. We've been doing
[49:51.580 --> 49:57.020]  a lot of shows. We probably have about one showcase a month and you know, this one, this one's a
[49:57.020 --> 50:02.140]  little rough cause it's on a Monday. So it's just, but he's just passing through and somehow we
[50:02.140 --> 50:08.060]  booked him. That's a Ron Babcock and he's, he's funny. Look him up. He's a funny guy. I think I'm
[50:08.060 --> 50:13.260]  free that Monday. So for five bucks, I'm going to try. Yeah. Like a professional comedian coming
[50:13.260 --> 50:17.900]  to Pueblo. Like, it's not like, Oh, it's not heard of, but it's like, you guys are going to miss it.
[50:17.900 --> 50:21.340]  And I don't want anybody to miss it. Like, Oh, I didn't even hear about that. You know what I heard?
[50:21.340 --> 50:26.540]  Like one of my favorite bands, Baroness, have you ever heard? They're like a metal band. Um,
[50:27.340 --> 50:32.220]  one of my favorite bands and my buddy Paul, who does comedy with me told me, yeah, we had them
[50:32.220 --> 50:38.140]  back in like 2000 come through and play some house show. They're fucking huge. They're like a huge
[50:38.220 --> 50:43.020]  band in metal. And they're just like, I missed it. And that's, that's why you miss it though.
[50:43.020 --> 50:46.540]  Is cause you don't know what's happening and there's not enough to do in Pueblo to where
[50:46.540 --> 50:50.540]  you guys can be like, Oh, I was doing this. And it's like, well, that's fine during the fair,
[50:51.260 --> 50:54.860]  but you don't have anything to do right now. Right? Something going on down there every day.
[50:54.860 --> 50:58.220]  It seems like though, you know, it's hard to distinguish what's good and what's not.
[50:58.220 --> 51:01.740]  Well, that's why I'm inviting you to this for five bucks. You can come and
[51:01.740 --> 51:05.100]  watch a professional comedian. You can watch me be a fucking piece of shit.
[51:05.660 --> 51:10.940]  And then, uh, Paul and John are there too. And they're funny. So you got two out of four,
[51:10.940 --> 51:14.300]  at least that'll be a good show. No, I have faith in you guys. You guys, we talk a lot of
[51:14.300 --> 51:17.900]  trash about you, uh, open micro comedians, but you guys are getting there. You've been at it for
[51:17.900 --> 51:21.020]  quite a while and you're getting there. You guys are funny now. I can only been doing it for a
[51:21.020 --> 51:26.220]  year. The comedy scene here has definitely blossomed and evolved in quite a nice. Yeah,
[51:26.220 --> 51:31.420]  yeah, for sure. There's another one opening. So that's pretty crazy. It's going to be fun. It's
[51:31.740 --> 51:36.140]  we're just getting there. Comedy heals the world guys, comedy and cannabis. They go well together.
[51:37.500 --> 51:40.220]  I guess that's a good way to end this portion of the show. Adam, you got anything to plug?
[51:40.780 --> 51:47.180]  Um, overgrow the gov.com on Twitter for 20th dot com. Adam will be here when I do the intro and
[51:47.180 --> 51:50.860]  exits to the show. So he'll get to say a lot more cool stuff for the show. Clint dude, thanks for
[51:50.860 --> 51:53.900]  taking a night out or a little bit of time out of your night. You got to get to work pretty soon.
[51:53.900 --> 51:57.180]  Yeah. We've kept you for longer than we should have. I'm doing well, buddy. Thank you. Cool.
[51:57.180 --> 52:00.380]  Cool. Thanks for coming. Uh, you're welcome back. When you have more questions, more stuff to say
[52:00.380 --> 52:03.980]  whenever you need anything, come by. You don't have to just be on the podcast to drop by either.
[52:03.980 --> 52:07.980]  Come by, hang out. We'd like you at the table. We do need to. Yes. All right, guys, we're going to
[52:07.980 --> 52:15.690]  wrap up this portion of the show right here and I'll be right back to do the closing. All right.
[52:15.690 --> 52:20.090]  That was another successful episode of the I grow culture podcast. Before I say goodbye, I want to

[53:15.930 --> 53:51.150]  the I grow culture podcast. Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me. If you hadn't heard,
[53:51.230 --> 53:55.150]  well, I'm all about my medicine. Peace to my crew. Yeah, I'm calling out to 17.
[53:56.270 --> 54:00.350]  All the way to the UK. They got my nails sticking today. Don't like a two-page.
[54:10.950 --> 54:14.550]  They keep telling me it's bad for my health. Well, please keep your blunt raps to yourself.
[54:15.990 --> 54:19.830]  And even these days, I think smoking joints is bad. I guess I'm spoiled by the oil,
[54:19.830 --> 54:24.470]  which annoys my pad, but not as spoiled as you lovers of sack who keep telling me the butter is
[54:48.400 --> 54:54.960]  see that jump shot. Nothing but no MPD. Hey, yo, pass me the rock, man. I can do this shit all day.
[54:56.400 --> 55:13.970]  I heard Cali got the medicals. Well, your boy passed. Sometimes I get a bit ahead of myself
[55:13.970 --> 55:18.210]  while eating edibles. It's better for my general health and stealth. Our ship's leaving and we're
[55:18.210 --> 55:22.770]  raising the cell. We'll see you later. You haters laugh to hate on yourself because my team is going
[55:22.770 --> 55:28.370]  places. And well, I want to see my name in the stars and my ugly face. And now I can do it. I'm
[55:29.250 --> 55:54.900]  a rocker. No, I haven't. I'm lying to my stone face. Sorry, y'all, but I'm growing at my own
[55:54.900 --> 56:00.980]  pace. Slow L stops coming over with the cold case. We're taking it to the dome. Stop sits on the
[56:00.980 --> 56:05.780]  throne, making hits from the home base. Me myself. I'm an entrepreneur. Concentrate,
[56:05.780 --> 56:10.100]  connoisseur, clean my rig and I'm clogging the sewer. We came here just to better the game.
[56:10.740 --> 56:15.300]  We innovated and we never the same. We run shit. Even if the weather is rain,
[56:15.940 --> 56:22.100]  y'all remember the name. We came here just to better the game. We're innovative and we're
[56:22.100 --> 56:27.940]  never the same. We run shit. Even if the weather is rain, TNL, y'all remember the name and we out.
[56:30.820 --> 56:33.620]  Water sucks. Gatorade is better.
