[00:00.000 --> 00:01.520]  Yeah, here we go.
[00:01.520 --> 00:02.520]  What's up, podcast world?
[00:02.520 --> 00:07.320]  It is time for episode 467 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:07.320 --> 00:11.460]  This episode of the show is brought to you by Seeds Here Now.
[00:11.460 --> 00:16.180]  If you need new regular, feminized, or auto flower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend
[00:16.180 --> 00:24.520]  Seeds Here Now, and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:24.520 --> 00:28.080]  You know, I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:28.080 --> 00:33.160]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Secret Kush Mints Live Batter from our friends at Green
[00:33.160 --> 00:34.560]  Dot Labs.
[00:34.560 --> 00:37.400]  This is a blend of secret cookie and kush mints.
[00:37.400 --> 00:42.200]  The label says the flavor should taste like oatmeal, raisin, and sugar cookies.
[00:42.200 --> 00:47.640]  You know, when I dab this, it absolutely tastes like a Little Debbie oatmeal cream pie, and
[00:47.640 --> 00:49.580]  I fucking love it.
[00:49.580 --> 00:51.600]  This concentrate tastes delicious.
[00:51.600 --> 00:53.840]  It's got a really nice, heavy buzz to it.
[00:53.840 --> 00:55.400]  It sits me back in my chair.
[00:55.400 --> 00:56.560]  It makes me want to chill out.
[00:56.680 --> 00:59.480]  It kind of makes me feel heavy and lazy, and I really enjoy it.
[00:59.480 --> 01:03.320]  It slows me down, and most of the time, I'm going a little bit too fast.
[01:03.320 --> 01:08.220]  So I really dig the Secret Kush Mints Live Batter from Green Dot Labs.
[01:08.220 --> 01:14.640]  The potency label says 68.83% THC and zero CBD.
[01:14.640 --> 01:18.200]  The flavor and the buzz are where it's at with this concentrate.
[01:18.200 --> 01:20.840]  Big shout out to my friends at Green Dot Labs.
[01:20.840 --> 01:22.120]  All right, podcast world.
[01:22.120 --> 01:25.080]  In this episode, I'm going to read a couple of listener emails.
[01:25.080 --> 01:29.000]  I'm going to give you an update on the PL Grow Minder unit that we sent to our friend
[01:29.000 --> 01:30.400]  up in Canada.
[01:30.400 --> 01:35.800]  Before we get there, let's do some shout outs to a few of our friends on Patreon.
[01:35.800 --> 01:37.120]  Let's start off with ladies first.
[01:37.120 --> 01:40.880]  How about a big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to my friend, Miss Mel.
[01:40.880 --> 01:44.400]  I want to send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and a thank you to our friends
[01:44.400 --> 01:45.960]  at Hogan's Farms.
[01:45.960 --> 01:48.440]  Also a big shout out and a thank you to BAFSTA.
[01:48.440 --> 01:53.400]  And last, but certainly not least, I want to send a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast
[01:53.680 --> 01:55.840]  thank you shout out to my friend Aldridge.
[01:55.840 --> 01:59.080]  Thank you to each and every one of you for supporting the show.
[01:59.080 --> 02:03.080]  And if anybody out there would like to learn how to become a patron and support the show
[02:03.080 --> 02:11.460]  on Patreon, you can do so by visiting www.patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[02:11.460 --> 02:14.680]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[02:14.680 --> 02:18.120]  All right, I feel like I've gotten all of the business handled here at the start of
[02:18.120 --> 02:19.120]  the show.
[02:19.120 --> 02:20.400]  Let's get to the fun part.
[02:20.400 --> 02:24.120]  Let's jump into the email portion of this podcast.
[02:24.120 --> 02:27.760]  Before I read the email, let me give you a short update.
[02:27.760 --> 02:32.520]  Several episodes back, I read an email from a listener who was having technical difficulties
[02:32.520 --> 02:34.640]  with his monitoring equipment.
[02:34.640 --> 02:40.060]  This listener had three different hygrometers and thermometers in his grow environment and
[02:40.060 --> 02:44.080]  all three of them were giving him different readings.
[02:44.080 --> 02:48.760]  As a responsible gardener, my friend wanted to know what was happening in his grow room
[02:48.840 --> 02:50.000]  at all times.
[02:50.000 --> 02:55.720]  So he sent me an email asking for guidance on how to diagnose the problem and also how
[02:55.720 --> 02:58.000]  to correct the problem.
[02:58.000 --> 03:04.320]  Now as I read the email, I knew that our friend needed a high quality monitoring device for
[03:04.320 --> 03:05.880]  his grow environment.
[03:05.880 --> 03:11.000]  I am going to assume that the three devices he purchased were probably something from
[03:11.000 --> 03:17.000]  a garden supply store and they did not need to be super critical on accuracy.
[03:17.000 --> 03:22.640]  If you are using your store-bought thermometer just to pay attention to how hot it is in
[03:22.640 --> 03:28.680]  the house or how hot it is outside, if it is just three to five degrees off, it won't
[03:28.680 --> 03:32.080]  cause any problems other than maybe it's annoying.
[03:32.080 --> 03:34.040]  You may say, hey, how hot is it?
[03:34.040 --> 03:38.160]  And you look and you say it's 84 degrees and you just go, oh, that's hot.
[03:38.160 --> 03:41.360]  That's really all people use thermometers for in most scenarios.
[03:41.360 --> 03:45.300]  You look outside, you see it's sunshiny outside, you put your hand over your eyes and squint
[03:45.300 --> 03:48.260]  a little bit so you can see that thermometer out there on the pole by the bird feeder and
[03:48.260 --> 03:50.660]  you go, oh, it's fucking 97 degrees.
[03:50.660 --> 03:52.060]  You're right, it's hot.
[03:52.060 --> 03:56.060]  We just use it to verify what we already assumed most of the time.
[03:56.060 --> 04:01.540]  So those things you're buying at the store don't have to be dialed in super precisely.
[04:01.540 --> 04:06.440]  So I am going to assume that the three units that were originally purchased were probably
[04:06.440 --> 04:12.260]  from a hardware store or a small gross supply store, or probably from the gardening center
[04:12.260 --> 04:17.260]  in a chain hardware store that is most often where people are shopping these days.
[04:17.260 --> 04:20.780]  So those devices were not meant for that application.
[04:20.780 --> 04:25.760]  I knew that I had the correct device for this application.
[04:25.760 --> 04:29.820]  Our friends at PL Grow make a unit called the minder unit.
[04:29.820 --> 04:34.920]  And what the PL Grow minder unit does is it monitors temperature and it also monitors
[04:34.920 --> 04:35.980]  humidity.
[04:35.980 --> 04:41.060]  And as it is monitoring those two things, it does an equation and it instantly tells
[04:41.060 --> 04:44.680]  you the vapor pressure deficit in that grow room.
[04:44.680 --> 04:49.100]  It also is monitoring the temperature of the water in your reservoir.
[04:49.100 --> 04:52.840]  If you have that set up, it can also measure a couple of other things depending on parameters
[04:52.840 --> 04:54.360]  you select.
[04:54.360 --> 04:59.080]  But I knew that we could use it to monitor the temperature and humidity in our friends
[04:59.080 --> 05:04.480]  grow and we could get rid of those three useless devices which were causing him problems.
[05:04.480 --> 05:09.540]  So as I was reading the email, it dawned on me that our friends at PL Grow gave me a couple
[05:09.540 --> 05:14.800]  of minder units to give away as prizes to people who listen to the podcast.
[05:14.800 --> 05:19.860]  As I was reading the email, I thought, this person needs a PL Grow minder unit.
[05:19.860 --> 05:26.080]  So I was kind enough to ask for his address and I mailed him a PL Grow minder unit.
[05:26.080 --> 05:30.740]  The joke is on me because I had to ship that bad dog to Canada, but hey, it made it and
[05:30.740 --> 05:31.740]  that's all that matters.
[05:31.740 --> 05:34.660]  So our friend has a PL Grow minder unit.
[05:34.660 --> 05:36.260]  He set up the unit.
[05:36.260 --> 05:41.880]  In just a very few minutes, he was able to log in on his phone and look at the environmental
[05:41.880 --> 05:43.820]  conditions in his grow room.
[05:43.820 --> 05:47.640]  And now he can monitor that grow room at all times.
[05:47.640 --> 05:52.340]  So I've got an email from our friend with an update on how life is going now that he
[05:52.340 --> 05:54.860]  has received the PL Grow minder unit.
[05:54.860 --> 05:56.760]  So I am going to press pause for a moment.
[05:56.760 --> 05:57.760]  I need a quick drink.
[05:57.760 --> 06:00.220]  I'll probably take like eight dabs.
[06:00.220 --> 06:01.620]  Then I'll take another drink.
[06:01.620 --> 06:06.340]  When I get back, I'm going to read the email from our friend, St. Stephen, about his new
[06:06.340 --> 06:09.580]  PL Grow minder unit.
[06:09.580 --> 06:10.900]  Take a dab with me, boys and girls.
[06:10.900 --> 06:11.900]  I'll be right back.
[06:11.900 --> 06:14.100]  All right, podcast world, I am back.
[06:14.100 --> 06:15.100]  I am well medicated.
[06:15.100 --> 06:18.900]  I am well hydrated and I am ready to jump into this email.
[06:18.900 --> 06:23.760]  This chain of emails starts off with a photo of our buddy, St. Stephen, impatiently staring
[06:23.760 --> 06:28.320]  out the window waiting for the UPS truck to deliver that brand new PL Grow unit.
[06:28.320 --> 06:32.240]  Then the next email is a photo of our buddy, St. Stephen, with a big old smile on his face
[06:32.240 --> 06:36.240]  and he is holding the brand new PL Grow minder unit.
[06:36.240 --> 06:37.240]  It made it.
[06:37.240 --> 06:38.240]  It has arrived.
[06:38.240 --> 06:42.480]  The email that came along with this wonderful photo goes a lot like this.
[06:42.480 --> 06:46.640]  Dear Rasta Jeff, my P&L minder unit has finally arrived.
[06:46.640 --> 06:48.160]  And that took a long time to get there.
[06:48.160 --> 06:49.960]  Also, I sent that several days ago.
[06:49.960 --> 06:51.600]  It had to make it through the Canadian post.
[06:51.600 --> 06:52.600]  Then it had to get to you.
[06:52.600 --> 06:55.040]  It looks like it sat at customs for a couple of days.
[06:55.040 --> 06:56.680]  I apologize for that.
[06:56.800 --> 06:58.640]  The unit has arrived.
[06:58.640 --> 06:59.640]  The email continues.
[06:59.640 --> 07:03.440]  It says, thanks so much for getting this sent out to me.
[07:03.440 --> 07:08.720]  I have charged and registered it and I am now getting accurate temperature and humidity
[07:08.720 --> 07:11.960]  levels in my room and in my reservoir.
[07:11.960 --> 07:15.960]  So it sounds like he was able to get the unit set up with no trouble at all.
[07:15.960 --> 07:20.360]  He had to charge it up and then you have to connect it to the website and register it,
[07:20.360 --> 07:24.420]  create your login information, and then you are pretty much ready to go.
[07:24.420 --> 07:26.360]  So it sounds like he got through the registration.
[07:27.040 --> 07:30.520]  It says, I will keep you posted as time goes by.
[07:30.520 --> 07:35.240]  I cannot wait to hear what was actually happening in that room compared to what you thought
[07:35.240 --> 07:36.920]  was happening in that room.
[07:36.920 --> 07:40.620]  And I also look forward to photos of the improved garden.
[07:40.620 --> 07:45.040]  So it goes on to say, I have one thing I would like to share with all of the listeners in
[07:45.040 --> 07:50.720]  the Northern Hemisphere who may have heat and humidity issues in their growth spaces.
[07:50.720 --> 07:55.180]  So all of my Canadian friends, this is a message from our friend, St. Stephen, to all of you
[07:55.180 --> 07:56.320]  up there in the North.
[07:56.320 --> 08:00.760]  It says, air conditioners are super cheap right now.
[08:00.760 --> 08:04.800]  I just got a beautiful four-in-one unit at a big box store.
[08:04.800 --> 08:09.720]  They needed to get rid of a bunch of pre-opened boxes that had been marked down three times
[08:09.720 --> 08:13.680]  and I picked it up at 25% of the listed price.
[08:13.680 --> 08:18.600]  The unit heats, cools, dehumidifies, and air conditions.
[08:18.600 --> 08:20.800]  You can change settings via Wi-Fi.
[08:20.800 --> 08:26.200]  And now that I have a minder unit, I am 100% dialed in and adjusting my grow room, humidity,
[08:26.280 --> 08:29.040]  and temperatures from work.
[08:29.040 --> 08:36.040]  So our friend St. Stephen has combined his PL Grow Minder unit along with a air conditioner,
[08:36.040 --> 08:42.040]  dehumidifier, heater unit that also runs on Wi-Fi, and he is controlling and dialing in
[08:42.040 --> 08:45.160]  his grow room environment from the office at work.
[08:45.160 --> 08:46.760]  He doesn't have to leave work.
[08:46.760 --> 08:51.600]  He probably looks like he is accomplishing work tasks while he is actually dialing in
[08:51.600 --> 08:52.880]  this grow room.
[08:52.880 --> 08:55.280]  So here's a good scenario that could possibly happen.
[08:55.360 --> 08:58.520]  Today in Colorado was unusually cool.
[08:58.520 --> 09:01.120]  Today was the first cool day that we've had in quite a while.
[09:01.120 --> 09:02.760]  It has been really hot.
[09:02.760 --> 09:06.200]  Today I thought I might get out the hoodie and wear some long sleeves.
[09:06.200 --> 09:11.200]  My personal grow space is set up for the summer type environment.
[09:11.200 --> 09:15.720]  I've got an air conditioner, I've got a dehumidifier, and I am working to keep the humidity out
[09:15.720 --> 09:20.200]  and keep the temperature down because outside it has been 105 degrees.
[09:20.200 --> 09:24.640]  When the temperature drops, it tends to also lower the humidity.
[09:24.640 --> 09:30.000]  So the humidity got lower outside today than it has in the past few months.
[09:30.000 --> 09:34.620]  That gives me the opportunity to reduce the humidity in my grow room a little bit too
[09:34.620 --> 09:38.300]  low because I am not competing with the heat from the outside.
[09:38.300 --> 09:42.120]  So the rest of my equipment is set to expect it to be hot out there.
[09:42.120 --> 09:47.600]  So now I may be actually disrupting the ideal environment in my grow space because my equipment
[09:47.600 --> 09:49.440]  is not properly dialed in.
[09:49.440 --> 09:52.160]  Now on the coast, you're going to say, what are you talking about?
[09:52.160 --> 09:53.760]  You guys don't have to worry about this stuff.
[09:53.880 --> 09:59.800]  But in Colorado, we have drastic temperature and environmental changes through the seasons.
[09:59.800 --> 10:02.520]  It is going to start getting 60 degrees.
[10:02.520 --> 10:04.720]  It is going to become 50 degrees.
[10:04.720 --> 10:06.920]  Before too long, it will be 30 degrees.
[10:06.920 --> 10:11.800]  Then eventually I will have 10 degrees, maybe in the zeros, maybe negative temperatures
[10:11.800 --> 10:13.840]  toward January and February.
[10:13.840 --> 10:16.920]  So I have to start adjusting my grow room for the winter conditions.
[10:16.920 --> 10:22.440]  And I'm getting off track, but what I'm heading for is since today we had a weather anomaly,
[10:22.440 --> 10:27.360]  if I were unable to get to the grow space, I could simply open up my phone, log into
[10:27.360 --> 10:28.360]  my P.O.
[10:28.360 --> 10:32.560]  GrowMinder unit, and I can see what is happening in my grow space.
[10:32.560 --> 10:34.040]  By quickly looking at my P.O.
[10:34.040 --> 10:38.160]  GrowMinder unit chart, I can see that the temperature is just right.
[10:38.160 --> 10:40.320]  I can see that the humidity is just right.
[10:40.320 --> 10:42.760]  I can see that the VPD is perfect.
[10:42.760 --> 10:46.380]  I can see that the water in my reservoir is the right temperature.
[10:46.380 --> 10:49.960]  So when my pump comes on to water my plants, they don't get water that is too hot or too
[10:49.960 --> 10:50.960]  cold.
[10:50.960 --> 10:53.160]  So I can simply log in to my P.O.
[10:53.160 --> 10:58.080]  GrowMinder unit and assure myself that just because it got a little bit cold outside,
[10:58.080 --> 11:01.400]  it has not gotten cold and dry inside my grow room.
[11:01.400 --> 11:02.920]  So I can ease my paranoia.
[11:02.920 --> 11:06.880]  I can put my phone back in my pocket and I can go back to focusing on whatever task I
[11:06.880 --> 11:09.240]  was trying to accomplish at the time.
[11:09.240 --> 11:12.400]  So that is a great example of how to utilize the P.O.
[11:12.400 --> 11:15.580]  GrowMinder unit and why the unit is so helpful.
[11:15.580 --> 11:18.160]  You can check on your grow from work.
[11:18.160 --> 11:23.720]  You can check on your grow from across the planet as long as you have got a wifi connection.
[11:23.720 --> 11:26.760]  Now our friend St. Stephen has taken it a step further.
[11:26.760 --> 11:30.580]  He has also put his equipment on a wifi controller.
[11:30.580 --> 11:33.320]  So if he does notice that that P.O.
[11:33.320 --> 11:36.060]  GrowMinder unit says, Hey, it's too hot in there.
[11:36.060 --> 11:39.960]  He can go to his phone and he can open up whatever application it is that runs that
[11:39.960 --> 11:40.960]  air conditioner.
[11:40.960 --> 11:43.640]  And he can say, kick on the air conditioner and it'll kick on.
[11:43.640 --> 11:45.240]  And he can watch the P.O.
[11:45.240 --> 11:47.160]  GrowMinder unit in real time.
[11:47.160 --> 11:50.520]  Once that air conditioner gets that temperature down where he wants it, he can either have
[11:50.520 --> 11:55.080]  it programmed in the application to turn off the air conditioner, or he can watch it.
[11:55.080 --> 11:56.080]  Just pay attention to that P.O.
[11:56.080 --> 11:57.080]  Minder unit.
[11:57.080 --> 11:59.960]  Watch the chart, watch the graph, watch it go down, down, down, down, down.
[11:59.960 --> 12:03.200]  Once it hits the temperature he wants, just go to the other application, turn off the
[12:03.200 --> 12:04.200]  air conditioner.
[12:04.200 --> 12:06.160]  And now the grow room has been saved.
[12:06.160 --> 12:07.160]  There are no temperature issues.
[12:07.160 --> 12:08.840]  There are no humidity issues.
[12:08.840 --> 12:12.800]  There won't be any problems and everybody will have a successful harvest.
[12:12.800 --> 12:16.120]  So that is a great advantage and a great use of the P.O.
[12:16.120 --> 12:21.720]  GrowMinder unit combined with other internet wifi activated devices.
[12:21.720 --> 12:26.160]  So that is a great way to monitor and control your grow environment.
[12:26.160 --> 12:27.360]  So there is more to this email.
[12:27.360 --> 12:28.760]  Let me get myself back on track.
[12:28.760 --> 12:33.440]  It says at any rate, I wanted to share that these air conditioner, heater, dehumidifier
[12:33.440 --> 12:35.680]  units are being given away right now.
[12:35.680 --> 12:40.360]  And for the first time I am not sweating bullets in here, even though it's 80 degrees and humid
[12:40.360 --> 12:41.800]  outside.
[12:41.800 --> 12:47.200]  Also at a very discounted rate, our buddy found himself a high quality, super functional
[12:47.200 --> 12:50.000]  air conditioner, dehumidifier, and a heater.
[12:50.000 --> 12:54.520]  And he has finally got his grow room dialed in and we know it's right because he is using
[12:54.520 --> 12:55.520]  his P.O.
[12:55.520 --> 12:56.520]  GrowMinder unit.
[12:56.520 --> 12:58.800]  He ends this message by saying, thanks again.
[12:58.800 --> 13:00.440]  I will keep you posted.
[13:00.440 --> 13:02.960]  He signs it with St. Stephen.
[13:02.960 --> 13:08.240]  Then just a couple of days later, I got another message and it says, the minder unit is better
[13:08.240 --> 13:10.040]  than you described.
[13:10.040 --> 13:14.720]  I thought I had a good idea what was happening in my grow room before, but it is clear now
[13:14.720 --> 13:17.720]  that I had no idea.
[13:17.720 --> 13:18.720]  That's right.
[13:18.720 --> 13:19.720]  You guys, the P.O.
[13:19.720 --> 13:22.940]  GrowMinder unit monitors what is happening 24 hours a day.
[13:22.940 --> 13:28.200]  And you will be surprised to find what happens for an hour after your lights go off or an
[13:28.200 --> 13:30.480]  hour after your lights come on.
[13:30.480 --> 13:35.080]  I really don't think that most growers are aware of what is happening in the grow room
[13:35.080 --> 13:37.480]  when the lights go off and when the lights go on.
[13:37.480 --> 13:42.160]  There are drastic humidity and temperature swings occurring in your grow room that you
[13:42.160 --> 13:44.240]  are completely unaware of.
[13:44.240 --> 13:46.680]  So I highly recommend a P.O.
[13:46.680 --> 13:52.640]  GrowMinder unit in your environment so that you can identify these temperature and vapor
[13:52.640 --> 13:57.000]  pressure deficit swings and you can correct them before they cause problems.
[13:57.000 --> 14:02.840]  And even if you don't have problems, you can correct them and possibly most likely improve
[14:02.840 --> 14:05.840]  the overall quality of your final product.
[14:06.200 --> 14:08.000]  Big shout out to our buddy, St. Stephen.
[14:08.000 --> 14:09.000]  I'm glad the P.O.
[14:09.000 --> 14:11.640]  GrowMinder unit made it to you safely.
[14:11.640 --> 14:15.440]  I am delighted to hear that it is helping you dial in the grow room.
[14:15.440 --> 14:20.620]  And it is extra awesome of you to share the fact that there are impressive air conditioning
[14:20.620 --> 14:27.640]  units on sale for 25% of the regular price at the big box stores up there in Canada.
[14:27.640 --> 14:30.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you're going to get yourself a P.O.
[14:30.000 --> 14:33.600]  GrowMinder unit, you can grab them at PLGrow.Systems.
[14:33.600 --> 14:39.920]  And while you're there, make sure you use coupon code GFYH25 and you will get 25% off
[14:39.920 --> 14:43.880]  of your order at PLGrow.Systems.
[14:43.880 --> 14:48.400]  I also want to send a huge shout out to Peter and Lee at P&L Grow Systems.
[14:48.400 --> 14:50.000]  Great guys, good friends.
[14:50.000 --> 14:53.600]  Thank you for all of the podcast support and for all of the support with the P.O.
[14:53.600 --> 14:55.240]  GrowMinder units.
[14:55.240 --> 14:58.280]  Also big shout out to our buddy, St. Stephen.
[14:58.280 --> 15:00.080]  I am glad I was able to help you out.
[15:00.080 --> 15:04.200]  It looks like I did a great job by selecting the perfect person for this unit.
[15:04.200 --> 15:07.280]  Please keep the updates coming and have fun in your garden, bro.
[15:07.280 --> 15:10.200]  I look forward to hearing from you in the future.
[15:10.200 --> 15:13.440]  All right, podcast world, I have a lot more stuff to get through, so let's jump right
[15:13.440 --> 15:15.120]  into the next email.
[15:15.120 --> 15:17.960]  This message goes just like this.
[15:17.960 --> 15:22.080]  Dear Rasta Jeff, I've been wondering for a while now how trichome ripeness and what we
[15:22.080 --> 15:24.320]  should look for has changed.
[15:24.320 --> 15:28.720]  With flour that is to be dried and smoked, generally you'd want to see all milky and
[15:28.720 --> 15:32.920]  maybe a few amber trichomes here and there before harvesting.
[15:32.920 --> 15:37.400]  But with fresh, frozen and washing, it seems the earlier the better.
[15:37.400 --> 15:39.720]  So let me kind of back up and touch on a few things here.
[15:39.720 --> 15:42.120]  There are a few things I should explain.
[15:42.120 --> 15:47.500]  This person is asking about when to harvest their cannabis plants based on the ripeness
[15:47.500 --> 15:54.560]  of the trichomes, but more specifically, when to harvest for specific uses of those flowers.
[15:54.560 --> 15:58.640]  They are correct in saying that when we are harvesting our flowers that are intended to
[15:58.640 --> 16:04.120]  be consumed as a dried and cured flower, we do want to let the trichomes ripen a little
[16:04.120 --> 16:10.640]  bit more than if we were going to harvest those plants and use them for a concentrate.
[16:10.640 --> 16:16.320]  In most times, a flower that is going to be smoked by itself as a raw flower, ground up,
[16:16.320 --> 16:20.640]  rolled into a joint, stuffed into a bowl, put into a vaporizer, however that is going
[16:20.640 --> 16:27.080]  to happen, we generally harvest those plants when the trichomes start showing about 15
[16:27.080 --> 16:29.640]  to 30% amber trichomes.
[16:29.640 --> 16:31.200]  That is kind of personal preference.
[16:31.200 --> 16:40.000]  It is also strain dependent, but most of the time we want somewhere between 15 to 30% amber trichomes.
[16:40.000 --> 16:43.120]  Trichomes are the only part of the plant that indicate ripeness.
[16:43.120 --> 16:45.680]  Don't let people teach you any other way.
[16:45.680 --> 16:49.000]  Trichomes are where all of the cannabinoids are produced in the plant.
[16:49.000 --> 16:51.320]  That is where all of the cannabinoids are held in the plant.
[16:51.320 --> 16:56.560]  When we harvest and we dry and cure, we are trying to get the ripest trichomes we can achieve.
[16:56.560 --> 17:01.240]  When we are harvesting for a plant to be consumed as a flower, we generally aim for
[17:01.240 --> 17:04.560]  15 to 30% amber trichomes.
[17:04.560 --> 17:09.540]  Those trichomes will continue to ripen over time after harvest.
[17:09.540 --> 17:12.720]  Some people will take the plants a little bit earlier because they are familiar with
[17:12.720 --> 17:17.520]  the phenotype and they prefer the head buzz that comes with an earlier harvest.
[17:17.520 --> 17:20.980]  Some people will let the plants go a little bit longer and let the trichomes get a little
[17:20.980 --> 17:25.320]  more amber because they prefer that later harvest buzz.
[17:25.320 --> 17:30.680]  That comes from developing a relationship with that cultivar and having multiple harvests
[17:30.680 --> 17:35.240]  to experience the buzz that comes from a different harvest window.
[17:35.240 --> 17:40.400]  When we are harvesting to make concentrates, it does make sense to harvest early.
[17:40.400 --> 17:43.200]  There are a couple of reasons why this makes sense.
[17:43.200 --> 17:48.280]  The first reason is, the trichomes have not begun to degrade and change colors, so you
[17:48.280 --> 17:52.420]  are still going to get a nice, clear concentrate.
[17:52.420 --> 17:56.420]  In this market, appearance means a lot when it comes to concentrate.
[17:56.420 --> 18:00.260]  A nice, clear trichome will make a nice, clear concentrate.
[18:00.260 --> 18:04.420]  Of course, there are many methods and techniques to clean up a concentrate these days, but
[18:04.420 --> 18:07.100]  if you don't have to clean it up, that saves you a step.
[18:07.100 --> 18:09.100]  You're already a step ahead of the game.
[18:09.100 --> 18:13.460]  Now, another reason we can harvest our plants a little bit earlier if we intend to make
[18:13.460 --> 18:19.420]  concentrates is that those trichomes will continue to degrade through the extraction
[18:19.420 --> 18:20.420]  process.
[18:20.420 --> 18:24.060]  The trichomes will beat the shit out of the trichomes, and those trichomes will continue
[18:24.060 --> 18:27.020]  to convert into other compounds.
[18:27.020 --> 18:32.620]  Freezing the material will change the compounds in the trichome head.
[18:32.620 --> 18:37.380]  Processing the material is going to change the compounds in the trichome head.
[18:37.380 --> 18:42.620]  The oxidation that occurs will change the compounds inside the trichome head.
[18:42.620 --> 18:46.460]  So by taking that plant down a little bit early, we still give ourselves a little bit
[18:46.460 --> 18:51.220]  of opportunity for those trichomes to convert into the later cannabinoids that come down
[18:51.220 --> 18:52.220]  the line.
[18:52.220 --> 18:55.780]  We are going to cause that to happen through heat and through processing.
[18:55.780 --> 19:00.840]  So it does make sense to harvest your plants, which intend to be used for concentrates,
[19:00.840 --> 19:06.020]  a little bit earlier than you would a plant that is intended to be smoked as a raw bud
[19:06.020 --> 19:07.020]  flower.
[19:07.020 --> 19:08.820]  So now I'm going to jump back into the message.
[19:08.820 --> 19:09.820]  There is more of this.
[19:09.820 --> 19:10.820]  It says,
[19:10.820 --> 19:15.420]  We used to believe that the point at which we harvested the trichomes affected the type
[19:15.420 --> 19:17.200]  of high you would receive.
[19:17.200 --> 19:21.060]  Do you find that to be a myth now that we have better understanding of cannabinoids
[19:21.060 --> 19:25.680]  and terpenes, especially pulling plants down earlier and getting great effects from the
[19:25.680 --> 19:27.500]  washed and pressed product?
[19:27.500 --> 19:30.260]  I love the podcast and I appreciate the help.
[19:30.260 --> 19:33.680]  Feel free to say my name and I hope all is well.
[19:33.680 --> 19:37.720]  You didn't sign your name, bro, so I don't know what your name is, but big shout out
[19:37.720 --> 19:41.340]  and thank you for the great email and all is Irie.
[19:41.340 --> 19:44.540]  Let's talk more about the question that you asked.
[19:44.660 --> 19:48.980]  Do I believe that harvesting a plant earlier or later will affect the high?
[19:48.980 --> 19:53.300]  Absolutely it will because the trichomes have done different things.
[19:53.300 --> 19:56.300]  Precursors have not turned into the later cannabinoids.
[19:56.300 --> 19:58.900]  So there is definitely the option for a different buzz.
[19:58.900 --> 20:02.580]  You don't have different compounds available or maybe those compounds have expired.
[20:02.580 --> 20:08.340]  So you were going to experience a different high from that flower or from that concentrate.
[20:08.340 --> 20:13.060]  So I do not think it is a myth that you get a different buzz from different harvest times.
[20:13.060 --> 20:16.660]  That is absolutely accurate because you were receiving different compounds.
[20:16.660 --> 20:19.820]  That's why we let the plants go a little longer or a little later.
[20:19.820 --> 20:23.380]  That's why they show ripeness or they don't show ripeness because it is actually a different
[20:23.380 --> 20:25.820]  compound in the trichome head.
[20:25.820 --> 20:30.140]  Then the follow-up question is, do I still believe this, especially with pulling plants
[20:30.140 --> 20:34.700]  down earlier and getting great effects from the washed and pressed products?
[20:34.700 --> 20:38.860]  I do think that you can get great product from plants that were harvested a little bit
[20:38.860 --> 20:41.940]  early, especially if you were washing or pressing them.
[20:41.940 --> 20:43.740]  Yes, that is very true.
[20:43.740 --> 20:47.820]  But also, that product may be better for you.
[20:47.820 --> 20:49.220]  That may be your preference.
[20:49.220 --> 20:53.780]  There may be other people out there with different preferences, different medical conditions,
[20:53.780 --> 20:57.700]  different needs for their medicine, and they may prefer the stuff that actually went a
[20:57.700 --> 20:59.100]  little bit longer.
[20:59.100 --> 21:04.820]  So the only way I think you can really determine what is best for you is if you grew the same
[21:04.820 --> 21:07.820]  plant and you cut it down at week seven.
[21:07.820 --> 21:11.200]  Then you grew the same plant and you cut that one down at week eight.
[21:11.200 --> 21:15.160]  Then you grew the same plant and you cut it down at week nine.
[21:15.160 --> 21:18.960]  Same grow room, same nutrients, same environment, same everything.
[21:18.960 --> 21:23.120]  Just harvest the plants one week apart and stagger it so we've got three different plants
[21:23.120 --> 21:25.080]  to do this experiment with.
[21:25.080 --> 21:27.800]  Then do your normal extraction process.
[21:27.800 --> 21:32.400]  If you cut it down and freeze it immediately and then run it however you run it, do that.
[21:32.400 --> 21:34.000]  But do that to all three.
[21:34.000 --> 21:36.520]  And then let's check out the finished product.
[21:36.520 --> 21:37.520]  Let's smoke it.
[21:37.520 --> 21:42.640]  Let's start our day with a big fat rip of that product while we're fresh and sober.
[21:42.640 --> 21:45.400]  Wake up, have a little snack, get your day started.
[21:45.400 --> 21:49.120]  And then when you're ready to smoke, start your day with that product.
[21:49.120 --> 21:51.760]  Start with the one you chopped down on week seven.
[21:51.760 --> 21:52.760]  Let's smoke it.
[21:52.760 --> 21:53.760]  See what it does.
[21:53.760 --> 21:54.760]  See how we feel.
[21:54.760 --> 21:55.760]  Take some notes.
[21:55.760 --> 21:56.760]  Is it psychedelic?
[21:56.760 --> 21:57.760]  Do you get all giggly?
[21:57.760 --> 21:58.760]  Did you forget where your keys are?
[21:58.760 --> 21:59.920]  Did you forget what you're doing?
[21:59.920 --> 22:01.600]  Or did you get fucking paranoid?
[22:01.600 --> 22:03.080]  Or did you want to take a nap?
[22:03.080 --> 22:04.080]  Did you get the giggles?
[22:04.080 --> 22:05.080]  Did you want to watch cartoons?
[22:05.080 --> 22:06.760]  Did you get the munchies?
[22:06.760 --> 22:08.800]  Write all of that shit down.
[22:08.800 --> 22:11.200]  Then tomorrow, let's repeat the process.
[22:11.200 --> 22:14.920]  Let's get up, get the day started, have a little snack, get the blood flowing, get some
[22:14.920 --> 22:17.000]  air in your lungs, get your life going.
[22:17.000 --> 22:20.880]  And then that first rip you want to take of the day, let's smoke some of that concentrate
[22:20.880 --> 22:23.840]  we made from the plant we cut down at week eight.
[22:23.840 --> 22:27.760]  Then let's take the same notes on that plant as we did on the week seven plant.
[22:27.760 --> 22:28.760]  Do you get giggly?
[22:28.760 --> 22:29.760]  Do you get paranoid?
[22:29.760 --> 22:30.760]  Do you get the munchies?
[22:30.760 --> 22:32.200]  Did it make your eyes real red?
[22:32.200 --> 22:34.400]  Did it make you hear a weird ringing noise?
[22:34.400 --> 22:35.600]  Did it make you want to take a nap?
[22:35.600 --> 22:36.880]  Did you have to poop?
[22:36.880 --> 22:37.880]  What did it do?
[22:37.880 --> 22:39.920]  What were the effects of that concentrate?
[22:39.920 --> 22:42.600]  Then tomorrow, let's repeat the process.
[22:42.600 --> 22:47.000]  Wake up nice and fresh, have breakfast, have a little snack, whatever you do.
[22:47.000 --> 22:50.680]  Watch some cartoons, get the day moving, get some blood flowing, get some air in your lungs,
[22:50.680 --> 22:52.960]  get the brain started when it's time to smoke.
[22:52.960 --> 22:56.000]  Let's get down on the plant that we cut down on week nine.
[22:56.000 --> 22:57.000]  Let's see what it does.
[22:57.000 --> 22:59.420]  Again, take all kinds of notes.
[22:59.420 --> 23:02.440]  By this smoke, you're going to know which one you prefer.
[23:02.440 --> 23:05.400]  Is it week seven, week eight, or week nine?
[23:05.400 --> 23:09.440]  Now, what you also may notice is that you may like the one that was cut down at week
[23:09.440 --> 23:10.600]  seven.
[23:10.600 --> 23:14.440]  What may be really weird is that your buddy really likes the one from week nine.
[23:14.440 --> 23:19.680]  Now, the best part of that is all three of those concentrates are quality concentrates.
[23:19.680 --> 23:27.000]  They are all acceptable by consumers and connoisseurs worldwide, but for some reason, the week seven
[23:27.000 --> 23:28.220]  is better for you.
[23:28.220 --> 23:30.360]  The week nine is better for your buddy.
[23:30.360 --> 23:32.360]  It is all about our personal preference.
[23:32.360 --> 23:33.840]  It's all about our physical makeup.
[23:33.840 --> 23:35.840]  It is all about our body chemistry.
[23:35.840 --> 23:37.520]  It is all about, I don't know what it could be about.
[23:37.520 --> 23:38.520]  It could be your blood type.
[23:38.520 --> 23:39.520]  It could be your brain type.
[23:39.520 --> 23:44.440]  It could be your level of whatever that that certain one works best for you.
[23:44.440 --> 23:50.360]  So overall, yes, I do agree that I would prefer to cut down flowers that are intended to be
[23:50.360 --> 23:55.400]  used as a concentrate a little bit earlier than a flower that is intended to be smoked
[23:55.400 --> 24:01.160]  as a raw bud or a flower, but I do not find it to be a myth that harvesting our plants
[24:01.160 --> 24:04.840]  at different times will create a different effect for the consumer.
[24:04.840 --> 24:09.580]  I think we will find that in a raw flower and I think we will also find that in any
[24:09.580 --> 24:13.960]  type of concentrates, whether it be a fresh frozen concentrate, whether it's a pressed
[24:13.960 --> 24:20.080]  or a washed product, or even the same with a BHO extracted concentrate.
[24:20.080 --> 24:24.000]  I think you will notice a difference in different harvest windows.
[24:24.000 --> 24:28.400]  Now, again, what individual consumers are going to prefer will be different.
[24:28.400 --> 24:29.760]  That will be consumer based.
[24:29.760 --> 24:35.520]  That is going to be blood type, body type, body chemistry, brain chemistry, and also
[24:35.520 --> 24:37.080]  what does that consumer prefer?
[24:37.080 --> 24:38.080]  Do they want to go up?
[24:38.080 --> 24:39.080]  Do they want to go down?
[24:39.080 --> 24:40.320]  Do they want to go sideways?
[24:40.320 --> 24:46.060]  It is all about the product and the consumer having that connection and that symbiosis.
[24:46.060 --> 24:51.720]  So I do not find it to be a myth that we can get a different effect through different harvest
[24:51.720 --> 24:52.720]  windows.
[24:52.720 --> 24:56.420]  I actually find that to be very true and I actually have science that can back that up.
[24:56.420 --> 24:58.680]  Really quickly, the science would be like this.
[24:58.680 --> 25:02.300]  If you cut down the plants early, there are different compounds available than if we cut
[25:02.300 --> 25:03.640]  down the plants later.
[25:03.640 --> 25:08.000]  Why wouldn't those different compounds affect a consumer in a different way?
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.320]  That is a really quick way to wrap that up.
[25:10.320 --> 25:14.120]  So I want to give a big thank you to our friend who says I can say his name, but did not include
[25:14.120 --> 25:15.800]  his name in the email.
[25:15.800 --> 25:17.080]  Thank you for the great question.
[25:17.080 --> 25:19.600]  I hope I got to clear up what you thought was a myth.
[25:19.600 --> 25:21.280]  I hope I got to give you some good information.
[25:21.280 --> 25:26.800]  Yes, it is a good idea to cut those plants down early if you intend to make a concentrate
[25:26.800 --> 25:27.800]  out of them.
[25:27.920 --> 25:32.760]  However, if you're going to smoke a raw flower, give it time, let it finish, and don't cut
[25:32.760 --> 25:36.400]  it down until those trichomes tell you that the plant is ready.
[25:36.400 --> 25:39.920]  All right, podcast world, that message took me a little longer than anticipated, so I'm
[25:39.920 --> 25:41.680]  going to wrap up the podcast here.
