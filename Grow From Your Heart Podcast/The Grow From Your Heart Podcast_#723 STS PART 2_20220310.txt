[02:43.780 --> 02:44.780]  Moon Tower.
[02:44.780 --> 02:45.780]  What is that?
[02:45.780 --> 02:46.780]  What?
[02:46.780 --> 02:47.780]  We recently talked about the Moon Tower.
[02:47.780 --> 02:51.140]  That is the Bubba Kush female pollinated by the Arise.
[02:51.140 --> 02:52.140]  We call it the Moon Tower.
[02:52.140 --> 02:55.300]  The name's inspired by, of course, the movie Dazed and Confused.
[02:55.300 --> 02:56.860]  All right, all right, all right.
[02:56.860 --> 02:58.260]  Party at the Moon Tower.
[02:58.260 --> 02:59.260]  That's enough about that.
[02:59.260 --> 03:00.260]  Join me.
[03:00.260 --> 03:03.960]  The groovy gravy, Secrets Stash Seed Event in Denver.

[03:04.960 --> 03:09.140]  Once again, if you need more info, send me an email or make sure you do follow itsgroovygravy
[03:09.140 --> 03:10.140]  on the gram.
[03:10.140 --> 03:12.780]  All right, where do we go from there?
[03:12.780 --> 03:16.860]  I was recently on, I've talked about this on a previous episode, I was recently on the
[03:16.860 --> 03:18.460]  Iry Army Podcast.
[03:18.460 --> 03:22.780]  I want to give a big shout out to all of my friends who support the Iry Army Podcast.
[03:22.780 --> 03:25.220]  Big up to Billy for the co-hosting skills there.
[03:25.220 --> 03:28.460]  Big up to Graybeard for the co-hosting and tech skills there.
[03:28.460 --> 03:29.460]  Very good questions.
[03:29.460 --> 03:31.300]  Very well done show.
[03:31.300 --> 03:32.300]  Very interactive show.
[03:32.300 --> 03:34.980]  We did 30 minutes of kind of structured material.
[03:34.980 --> 03:37.100]  They asked me pre-written questions.
[03:37.100 --> 03:40.660]  Then after that, they opened it up to the chat audience and they got to ask a bunch
[03:40.660 --> 03:41.660]  of questions.
[03:41.660 --> 03:42.660]  That was a good time.
[03:42.660 --> 03:43.660]  I think it was a well done show.
[03:43.660 --> 03:45.660]  I got to showcase my brand.
[03:45.660 --> 03:49.660]  I got to talk a lot about my history and who I am and got to answer all the questions that
[03:49.660 --> 03:52.780]  some of my friends and supporters have wanted to know.
[03:52.780 --> 03:53.780]  That was a great time.
[03:53.780 --> 03:57.640]  So make sure you check out the Iry Army Podcast if you're not already subscribed.
[03:57.640 --> 03:59.340]  Go to YouTube, give them a subscribe.
[03:59.340 --> 04:02.300]  Also, if you're not subscribed to my show, please do click subscribe.
[04:02.300 --> 04:03.940]  Now is a good time.
[04:03.940 --> 04:06.340]  Once again, big shout out to my friends at the Iry Army.
[04:07.220 --> 04:09.700]  Not just thanks for the podcast, but thanks for the hang.
[04:09.700 --> 04:11.060]  That was a good time.
[04:11.060 --> 04:15.740]  Then after we wrapped up the show, we hung out on the server and we chatted for a solid
[04:15.740 --> 04:17.800]  hour and that was a good time.
[04:17.800 --> 04:19.660]  Those guys are my friends, my family.
[04:19.660 --> 04:20.660]  That's my crew.
[04:20.660 --> 04:21.660]  So thank you.
[04:21.660 --> 04:22.660]  Big salute.
[04:22.660 --> 04:26.860]  Rasta Army, Iry Army, thank you for being, I was going to say part of the team.
[04:26.860 --> 04:27.900]  You guys are the team.
[04:27.900 --> 04:33.220]  I may be the team captain, but without all you maniacs, all you Iry Army members out
[04:33.220 --> 04:36.280]  there, I'm just a one man army and I do need the support of the crew, the team.
[04:37.220 --> 04:38.220]  So thank you.
[04:38.220 --> 04:39.360]  Each and every one of you do mean a lot to me.
[04:39.360 --> 04:44.240]  The Iry Army, we take more dabs before 9am than most people do all day.
[04:44.240 --> 04:47.600]  All right, let's keep moving with this podcast because I do have a lot of stuff I want to
[04:47.600 --> 04:48.600]  cover.
[04:48.600 --> 04:49.600]  I have a lot of notes here.
[04:49.600 --> 04:52.240]  I'm trying to get the notes lined up so I can read them and not get distracted.
[04:52.240 --> 04:53.240]  All right.
[04:53.240 --> 04:56.760]  I want to do an update on a recent silver thiosulfate episode.
[04:56.760 --> 05:02.240]  If you haven't been following along recently, I did a show about making our own silver thiosulfate.
[05:02.240 --> 05:06.480]  That is a solution which we would use to reverse a plant to make feminized seeds.
[05:06.480 --> 05:10.000]  I don't want to do a full recap because I've already done the full episode.
[05:10.000 --> 05:11.280]  Scroll back a couple episodes.
[05:11.280 --> 05:12.480]  It is available.
[05:12.480 --> 05:13.520]  Watch that one.
[05:13.520 --> 05:14.520]  This is the followup.
[05:14.520 --> 05:18.120]  Apparently I missed a few things, which that's not uncommon for me.
[05:18.120 --> 05:20.560]  I try to talk and be, what's the word?
[05:20.560 --> 05:21.640]  Succinct might be the word.
[05:21.640 --> 05:22.640]  I don't know.
[05:22.640 --> 05:23.640]  Text me, email me.
[05:23.640 --> 05:24.640]  Let me know if that's even a word.
[05:24.640 --> 05:28.560]  I try to get it right the first time, but I'm human and I'm also a stoner.
[05:28.560 --> 05:29.560]  I'm not a robot.
[05:29.560 --> 05:30.560]  I'm not a human.
[05:30.560 --> 05:31.560]  A lot of people say I'm an alien, a hundred percent human.
[05:31.560 --> 05:36.080]  I'm going to make some mistakes and thank you for giving me the opportunity to do updates
[05:36.080 --> 05:40.440]  and corrections and also forgive me when I do make more mistakes in the future because
[05:40.440 --> 05:42.800]  I promise I'm going to fuck up again.
[05:42.800 --> 05:48.640]  But for now I do have some updates, some corrections, some more info for the silver thiosulfate
[05:48.640 --> 05:49.640]  episode.
[05:49.640 --> 05:50.640]  Let's jump into it.
[05:50.640 --> 05:52.020]  Here goes the update.
[05:52.020 --> 05:54.640]  Silver thiosulfate part two.
[05:54.640 --> 05:59.600]  Most of these questions came from emails from the YouTube channel, through the I read
[05:59.600 --> 06:02.040]  genetics grow help tab on the website.
[06:02.040 --> 06:03.040]  Check out the website.
[06:03.040 --> 06:04.620]  There's a tab there that says grow help.
[06:04.620 --> 06:07.000]  If you have questions about anything, you can reach me through there.
[06:07.000 --> 06:08.480]  Just skip the grow help part.
[06:08.480 --> 06:09.480]  Type in your question at the bottom.
[06:09.480 --> 06:10.480]  I'll still get that.
[06:10.480 --> 06:11.480]  I will still answer that.
[06:11.480 --> 06:15.600]  If I have not answered your email or your tester application, once again, I do apologize.
[06:15.600 --> 06:18.280]  It's just me going to stay on track.
[06:18.280 --> 06:21.580]  A lot of the questions were about storing the solution.
[06:21.580 --> 06:25.860]  We would mix up part a mix up part B then mix them into a solution.
[06:25.860 --> 06:27.180]  Then we would dilute that.
[06:27.180 --> 06:29.180]  There were many questions about storage.
[06:29.180 --> 06:31.380]  Here is the straightforward answer.
[06:31.380 --> 06:36.140]  It is best to, okay, it will last longest, I think is the way that I should say this
[06:36.140 --> 06:38.100]  for best preservation of the product.
[06:38.100 --> 06:40.780]  It will last longest in the powder form.
[06:40.780 --> 06:44.100]  Once we mix it into the waters, we are the water.
[06:44.100 --> 06:47.540]  We are now reducing the shelf life of that product.
[06:47.540 --> 06:52.900]  Once we combine those two sources together, we are now even greatly more reducing the
[06:52.900 --> 06:54.380]  shelf life of that product.
[06:54.380 --> 06:59.100]  Once we dilute it, we have even more drastically reduced the shelf life of that product.
[06:59.100 --> 07:03.920]  Every time we dilute it, every time we mix it, we are reducing the shelf life and the
[07:03.920 --> 07:06.480]  viability of that product.
[07:06.480 --> 07:08.540]  What I recommend is I mix up one liter.
[07:08.540 --> 07:12.940]  I know that one liter is going to get me through my multiple days of spraying, my multiple
[07:12.940 --> 07:13.940]  applications.
[07:13.940 --> 07:17.740]  I can spray several plants several times, several days by mixing up one liter.
[07:17.740 --> 07:20.300]  That one liter recipe is really easy to make.
[07:20.300 --> 07:21.300]  The recipe is simple.
[07:21.300 --> 07:25.420]  The amount of water you need, the measuring equipment, 500 mils, the half gram, two and
[07:25.420 --> 07:26.420]  a half grams.
[07:26.420 --> 07:30.540]  The math works out very well and that's about how much I need to get my reversals done.
[07:30.540 --> 07:32.860]  So I make that one liter.
[07:32.860 --> 07:37.680]  That one liter stores long enough to get me through the 21 days worth of application without
[07:37.680 --> 07:39.480]  having any problems.
[07:39.480 --> 07:44.560]  If you do see discoloration or coloration, I guess any sort of color happening in there,
[07:44.560 --> 07:49.720]  sometimes you'll see dark granules or black chunks at the bottom of the mix.
[07:49.720 --> 07:50.720]  That's probably bad.
[07:50.720 --> 07:52.760]  You need to pour that out and remix.
[07:52.760 --> 07:56.040]  So I don't have a tried and true shelf life for this product.
[07:56.040 --> 08:00.440]  What I do know is that when I make that liter and I throw that liter in the refrigerator,
[08:00.440 --> 08:02.680]  that's something we're going to talk about here is storage.
[08:02.680 --> 08:05.640]  I keep it in a refrigerator and it is clearly labeled.
[08:05.640 --> 08:09.640]  It's a big jar and it says silver thiosulfate solution on it.
[08:09.640 --> 08:13.240]  So where nobody in my house, it's just me here, but I make sure that nobody that shows
[08:13.240 --> 08:15.700]  up comes over, is going to drink out of that.
[08:15.700 --> 08:17.540]  Maybe Mike comes over, takes a giant dab.
[08:17.540 --> 08:19.040]  Maybe Clint pops by.
[08:19.040 --> 08:23.280]  He doesn't dab because he's kind of not that cool yet, but maybe he hits the dab pen and
[08:23.280 --> 08:26.160]  he gets a little fuzzy and he goes to the fridge and needs something cold to drink.
[08:26.160 --> 08:29.500]  I want to make sure none of my crew, none of my friends, none of my family reach into
[08:29.500 --> 08:32.720]  my refrigerator and drink the silver thiosulfate solution.
[08:32.720 --> 08:35.040]  I don't think it would cause them drastic health problems.
[08:35.040 --> 08:36.480]  I don't want to find out.
[08:36.480 --> 08:39.120]  So it is clearly labeled in the fridge.
[08:39.120 --> 08:40.720]  Keep it in a cool, dry, dark place.
[08:40.720 --> 08:44.560]  If you can put it in a brown paper bag, like some bum wine, just put your clear jar in
[08:44.560 --> 08:46.960]  a brown bag that will protect it from the light.
[08:46.960 --> 08:48.280]  The light is off in the fridge.
[08:48.280 --> 08:49.680]  When you close the door, the light goes off.
[08:49.680 --> 08:50.760]  I don't fuck with the fridge a lot.
[08:50.760 --> 08:52.200]  I'm a single, not a single dude.
[08:52.200 --> 08:55.680]  I'm a bachelor living alone here by myself.
[08:55.680 --> 08:56.840]  The fridge doesn't get opened a lot.
[08:56.840 --> 09:00.420]  So it stays nice and cool, dry and dark in there.
[09:00.420 --> 09:03.740]  So honestly, it's effective for me.
[09:03.740 --> 09:06.500]  Over that course of 21 days, it does not lose its strength.
[09:06.500 --> 09:08.340]  It does not lose its viability.
[09:08.340 --> 09:13.620]  It does not lose its effectiveness over that 21 day period while it is kept in my fridge.
[09:13.620 --> 09:18.300]  So what I do is I'll take the one, the liter, I'll take out the amount that I need, put
[09:18.300 --> 09:20.620]  that in my spray bottle, dilute it.
[09:20.620 --> 09:23.980]  Usually I can get two applications from one spray bottle worth.
[09:23.980 --> 09:28.700]  I'm using just the spray bottle that you probably use to put cleaner in and spray the windows
[09:28.700 --> 09:31.340]  or some sort of just a basic spray bottles.
[09:31.340 --> 09:35.860]  I think it's 450 milliliters is what it's marked up to on the side of the bottle.
[09:35.860 --> 09:40.100]  I can get two applications of three semi-large plants out of that one bottle.
[09:40.100 --> 09:45.220]  So I mix it, I dilute it, I mix it, I fill that bottle, I shake the shit out of it, I
[09:45.220 --> 09:46.220]  spray.
[09:46.220 --> 09:47.820]  I leave that bottle sitting in a cool, dry, dark place.
[09:47.820 --> 09:49.820]  It's honestly in just my mix area.
[09:49.820 --> 09:52.020]  When I'm not in there, the lights in the mix area are off.
[09:52.020 --> 09:54.220]  It's cool, it's dry, it's dark.
[09:54.220 --> 09:55.740]  It's a comfortable environment for a person.
[09:55.740 --> 09:58.020]  I think that would be a decent environment for that solution.
[09:58.020 --> 09:59.420]  That sits there.
[09:59.420 --> 10:02.500]  Three days later, I shake the shit out of it again, apply it to the plants.
[10:02.500 --> 10:03.500]  Now my spray bottle is empty.
[10:03.500 --> 10:05.500]  At that time, I'll clean it out.
[10:05.500 --> 10:07.500]  When it's time to make more, I will make the dilution.
[10:07.500 --> 10:11.740]  I'll pour my 10 or 30 whatever percent into the container.
[10:11.740 --> 10:16.380]  Then I'll mix the 70 or 90% distilled water into there, shake the shit out of it.
[10:16.380 --> 10:19.700]  Then I can get once again two more applications out of that.
[10:19.700 --> 10:23.540]  By the time that jar, that mix is getting empty, my plants are done.
[10:23.540 --> 10:24.980]  They're reversed, they're getting cut down.
[10:24.980 --> 10:26.020]  It's already done the magic.
[10:26.020 --> 10:30.620]  So the storage, they store best as powders.
[10:30.620 --> 10:32.340]  They store a little less longer.
[10:32.340 --> 10:37.180]  Every time you mix them and dilute them, they start to lose their shelf life.
[10:37.180 --> 10:40.940]  I'm not a scientist, I'm not a chemistry major to be 100% honest with you.
[10:40.940 --> 10:44.700]  But in my experience, from the best of my knowledge, from what I've been taught, read
[10:44.700 --> 10:50.620]  and learned, they do last longest as the powder, shorter as they get wetter and more diluted,
[10:50.620 --> 10:51.620]  more dissolved.
[10:51.620 --> 10:53.060]  So keep them in a fridge.
[10:53.100 --> 10:56.140]  I keep them in a cool, dry, dark place, clearly labeled.
[10:56.140 --> 10:59.540]  Make sure that once again, if you have family, if you've got kids, especially if you've got
[10:59.540 --> 11:02.380]  kids, this may be a weird detail.
[11:02.380 --> 11:05.860]  If somebody, if you, if somebody in your house drinks alcohol, that's when we make a lot
[11:05.860 --> 11:06.860]  of silly mistakes.
[11:06.860 --> 11:08.580]  We do a lot of weird shit.
[11:08.580 --> 11:12.020]  Maybe put it somewhere that you cannot accidentally drink it if you're drunk.
[11:12.020 --> 11:15.500]  Put it in the bottom somewhere in the crisper drawer, in the bottom somewhere you just won't
[11:15.500 --> 11:16.500]  get to it.
[11:16.500 --> 11:18.380]  Set yourself up for success is what I'm saying.
[11:18.380 --> 11:22.980]  We don't want to be that grower, that breeder, that seed maker, that dipshit getting somebody
[11:22.980 --> 11:27.340]  sick because we didn't properly label and or store the things we're using for our growth.
[11:27.340 --> 11:30.900]  So put that in a safe, designated place, make sure it's labeled.
[11:30.900 --> 11:35.820]  Also keep in mind, drunk people, young people, sometimes old people, sometimes normal people
[11:35.820 --> 11:36.900]  can't fucking read.
[11:36.900 --> 11:39.660]  So set yourself up, your home up for success.
[11:39.660 --> 11:43.260]  I've seen people take a ring of duct tape and put it right around the top just because
[11:43.260 --> 11:45.620]  when people grab it, they're going to go, why the fuck is there duct tape around here?
[11:45.620 --> 11:49.580]  That'll slow them down, make them think not to drink the silver thiosulfate solution.
[11:49.580 --> 11:50.820]  I don't keep mine for very long.
[11:50.820 --> 11:52.580]  I use it and I make more.
[11:52.580 --> 11:58.020]  I keep that 100% solution in the refrigerator and I dilute it as I need it.
[11:58.020 --> 11:59.020]  I apply it.
[11:59.020 --> 12:02.540]  Usually I can get two sprays out of a solution, out of a mix.
[12:02.540 --> 12:08.060]  And that is basically the storage of the silver thiosulfate solutions.
[12:08.060 --> 12:09.060]  Now let's move forward.
[12:09.060 --> 12:10.980]  I spray with the lights off.
[12:10.980 --> 12:13.260]  One of the questions was, when do I spray?
[12:13.260 --> 12:16.540]  I try to spray any spray application with the lights off.
[12:16.540 --> 12:20.380]  This doesn't matter if you've got to turn, it's best if you can hit it right when the
[12:20.380 --> 12:21.840]  lights go off in the grow space.
[12:21.840 --> 12:25.080]  If you can time it to where like, you know, the lights go off at seven, you're in there
[12:25.080 --> 12:30.080]  at like 659, you start spraying, those lights go off and then you can finish spraying, close
[12:30.080 --> 12:31.440]  up and get out of there real quick.
[12:31.440 --> 12:32.440]  That's not a problem.
[12:32.440 --> 12:36.240]  That couple of minutes worth of spraying those plants with silver won't disrupt anything.
[12:36.240 --> 12:40.680]  If you could pull the plants out just before nighttime, take them to another location and
[12:40.680 --> 12:44.480]  spray them, then right as the lights go off, return them to their home and then let them
[12:44.480 --> 12:46.560]  sleep, that is probably best.
[12:46.560 --> 12:50.400]  So I always spray with the lights off if the plants are removed from the grow lights or
[12:50.400 --> 12:55.240]  you just don't want them under those intense lights for a couple of reasons.
[12:55.240 --> 12:57.840]  Remember when we were kids, some of us did this, some didn't.
[12:57.840 --> 13:01.880]  You could burn, if you watch Beavis and Butthead, you saw this, you could burn ants with a magnifying
[13:01.880 --> 13:02.880]  glass.
[13:02.880 --> 13:06.440]  If you get a bubble on your leaf when you're spraying with the big grow light on and that
[13:06.440 --> 13:10.000]  intense light hits that bubble, it could make a little burn mark on your plant.
[13:10.000 --> 13:13.040]  Also there's a thing called phototoxicity.
[13:13.040 --> 13:16.920]  Sometimes the things we spray on our plants may have a photo reaction with the light,
[13:16.920 --> 13:17.920]  with the heat.
[13:17.920 --> 13:21.040]  Something may cause an interaction to cause a problem on your plant.
[13:21.040 --> 13:22.960]  So let's not spray with the lights on.
[13:22.960 --> 13:26.040]  If you can drag those plants out of there, spray them right before the lights go off,
[13:26.040 --> 13:28.480]  right as the lights go off, put them back in the room so they're not getting hit with
[13:28.480 --> 13:30.200]  that big light while they're wet.
[13:30.200 --> 13:31.200]  That would be ideal.
[13:31.200 --> 13:34.880]  Be careful not to get the silver solution on other plants.
[13:34.880 --> 13:37.600]  You only want this on plants that are going to get sprayed.
[13:37.600 --> 13:41.280]  If you're putting them in a room with other plants, make sure that those plants, that
[13:41.280 --> 13:46.040]  the sprayed plants are dry before you introduce them back to the population.
[13:46.160 --> 13:51.240]  Another thing is I usually spray and then that first time I spray is about seven to
[13:51.240 --> 13:52.600]  10 days before a flower.
[13:52.600 --> 13:55.160]  So that one I just spray, lights go out, I spray.
[13:55.160 --> 13:56.960]  We're in veg, not a big deal.
[13:56.960 --> 13:59.240]  Once I go into flower, I will wait.
[13:59.240 --> 14:01.000]  So I've got my room set to 1212.
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.920]  It's going to come on at 9am or 9pm, however you're living.
[14:03.920 --> 14:04.960]  It comes on, right?
[14:04.960 --> 14:06.800]  So that light will come on whenever you got it scheduled.
[14:06.800 --> 14:08.520]  I don't know how your setup is going.
[14:08.520 --> 14:10.260]  The lights come on, boom, the plant's in there.
[14:10.260 --> 14:12.400]  This is its first day of 1212.
[14:12.400 --> 14:16.560]  When I know that that timer is about to go off, maybe 10, 15 minutes before that, I'll
[14:16.560 --> 14:19.720]  go grab that plant, pull it far from the light and spray it.
[14:19.720 --> 14:21.680]  Now this is day one for that plant.
[14:21.680 --> 14:24.920]  So I'm going to spray it with a silver solution, let it kind of dry up.
[14:24.920 --> 14:27.520]  Then when the lights go off, I'll just move it back to its normal spot.
[14:27.520 --> 14:30.160]  So that tomorrow when the light comes on, it's back in its home.
[14:30.160 --> 14:31.360]  That is its first day.
[14:31.360 --> 14:35.360]  I like to spray it right before the lights go off, then put it into darkness.
[14:35.360 --> 14:38.720]  Give it that first day of darkness right after that spray.
[14:38.720 --> 14:39.960]  That seems to work for me.
[14:39.960 --> 14:41.700]  That seems to be effective.
[14:41.700 --> 14:43.260]  That is the way I've been doing it.
[14:43.260 --> 14:44.820]  So that is when.
[14:44.820 --> 14:46.820]  So we've covered storage of the solution.
[14:46.820 --> 14:47.980]  We've covered when to spray.
[14:47.980 --> 14:50.500]  Spray with the lights off, spray in the dark.
[14:50.500 --> 14:52.000]  Make sure not to spray the other plants.
[14:52.000 --> 14:56.520]  If you've got to pull these plants out of the room and spray them, that may be ideal.
[14:56.520 --> 14:59.680]  That should be what you're doing anyway, because you want to flower these plants a little bit
[14:59.680 --> 15:00.740]  ahead of the females.
[15:00.740 --> 15:01.980]  We're going to talk more about that.
[15:01.980 --> 15:04.740]  That may be getting close to where we are.
[15:04.740 --> 15:08.460]  You want to get these male plants in a room by themselves if you can, or the pollen donor
[15:08.460 --> 15:12.300]  plants, I should say, in a room by themselves if you can and get them ahead of the girls
[15:12.300 --> 15:14.300]  when making fem seeds.
[15:14.300 --> 15:18.500]  Let's talk about one of the big questions we got was pollen collection and storage of
[15:18.500 --> 15:19.500]  the pollen.
[15:19.500 --> 15:20.900]  That is a really good question.
[15:20.900 --> 15:23.620]  Our main goal here is to create feminized pollen.
[15:23.620 --> 15:27.380]  What are we going to do with the pollen once we've created that?
[15:27.380 --> 15:30.780]  What I do, I've got two separate areas.
[15:30.780 --> 15:35.100]  I've got a main room with a three by three tent inside of that room.
[15:35.100 --> 15:37.080]  So my girls are in one area.
[15:37.080 --> 15:38.300]  They're vegging.
[15:39.140 --> 15:40.140]  They're under a light.
[15:40.140 --> 15:41.140]  They're getting vegged.
[15:41.140 --> 15:43.260]  Then I will move my male plant into the tent or my pollen donor.
[15:43.260 --> 15:46.580]  I should correct my nomenclature, my wordage here, my verbiage.
[15:46.580 --> 15:47.580]  This is a pollen donor.
[15:47.580 --> 15:49.220]  It's a female being moved to a tent.
[15:49.220 --> 15:51.380]  Three of them get moved to a tent.
[15:51.380 --> 15:52.380]  They are on their own light.
[15:52.380 --> 15:55.700]  Now I'll put them under 12-12 and spray them.
[15:55.700 --> 15:56.940]  They're going to start making pollen.
[15:56.940 --> 15:58.560]  You've got a couple of options.
[15:58.560 --> 16:02.020]  What I do, I grab those pollen donor plants.
[16:02.020 --> 16:06.620]  When I know it's about time, I grab them and I move them strategically throughout the grow
[16:06.620 --> 16:07.620]  space.
[16:07.940 --> 16:09.380]  One goes in the middle of all the females.
[16:09.380 --> 16:12.860]  One goes on this end of the females because there's an extraction fan on this end.
[16:12.860 --> 16:15.620]  So I want it to kind of pull the air right over there.
[16:15.620 --> 16:18.460]  The other one kind of sits off to the side because I'm saving that one.
[16:18.460 --> 16:23.020]  I want that one to make a bunch of pollen so that's my backup, my second pollination.
[16:23.020 --> 16:27.300]  So you can just put one at the edge of the plants, at the edge of the canopy and just
[16:27.300 --> 16:29.180]  let that pollen dust in.
[16:29.180 --> 16:30.460]  Or you can collect the pollen.
[16:30.460 --> 16:33.980]  If you want to collect it, keep the males in their own area, the pollen donors in their
[16:33.980 --> 16:34.980]  own area.
[16:35.020 --> 16:37.940]  And as the pollen starts coming out, you can tap it.
[16:37.940 --> 16:40.460]  I use, oftentimes, I'll get a Pyrex dish.
[16:40.460 --> 16:41.460]  It's going to be heavy.
[16:41.460 --> 16:43.820]  A Pyrex dish is much heavier than you anticipate.
[16:43.820 --> 16:44.860]  Get a good grip on it.
[16:44.860 --> 16:46.340]  Don't drop that bad bitch in the grow.
[16:46.340 --> 16:48.060]  You'll break some stuff, maybe even the dish.
[16:48.060 --> 16:49.140]  It will suck.
[16:49.140 --> 16:50.300]  So I've got the Pyrex dish.
[16:50.300 --> 16:51.420]  I've got a grip on it.
[16:51.420 --> 16:52.420]  I'm a drummer.
[16:52.420 --> 16:53.420]  I've got a drumstick handy.
[16:53.420 --> 16:58.660]  I'll grab a drumstick and just tap that plant and it'll tap the pollen right into that Pyrex
[16:58.660 --> 16:59.660]  dish.
[16:59.660 --> 17:00.660]  Just give it a few taps.
[17:00.660 --> 17:01.740]  You can do this every few days.
[17:01.740 --> 17:03.380]  It will start giving you pollen.
[17:03.380 --> 17:04.380]  It'll make more pollen.
[17:04.780 --> 17:08.580]  Just know that every time you touch this plant, pollen is going to go all over the place.
[17:08.580 --> 17:09.580]  There's going to be pollen everywhere.
[17:09.580 --> 17:10.580]  You're going to sneeze.
[17:10.580 --> 17:11.580]  It's going to taste gross.
[17:11.580 --> 17:12.980]  It's going to get in your eyes.
[17:12.980 --> 17:13.980]  It'll be funky.
[17:13.980 --> 17:18.780]  So you can drag that pollen donor over to the rest of the plant, over to the population
[17:18.780 --> 17:23.580]  when you're ready, or you can collect the pollen by tapping it, or you can take that
[17:23.580 --> 17:27.580]  Pyrex dish and you can straight up chop the tops off of your plant, your pollen donor
[17:27.580 --> 17:31.360]  plant, and lay it in that Pyrex dish and the pollen will fall out.
[17:31.360 --> 17:34.020]  As the plant dries, pollen will land into your dish.
[17:34.660 --> 17:35.660]  You could tap it.
[17:35.660 --> 17:36.660]  You could tap it with a drumstick, with your fingers.
[17:36.660 --> 17:39.020]  Smack the plant onto the dish carefully, gently.
[17:39.020 --> 17:40.020]  Don't blow the pollen everywhere.
[17:40.020 --> 17:41.020]  It's sensitive.
[17:41.020 --> 17:42.660]  The wind will make it go crazy.
[17:42.660 --> 17:43.660]  Tap it.
[17:43.660 --> 17:44.660]  Tap that plant onto the dish.
[17:44.660 --> 17:46.780]  The pollen will fall out.
[17:46.780 --> 17:52.220]  One of the most important things about pollen is let it get dry.
[17:52.220 --> 17:53.620]  Moisture will destroy pollen.
[17:53.620 --> 17:56.180]  That's something we're going to talk about a lot here.
[17:56.180 --> 17:57.300]  Moisture destroys pollen.
[17:57.300 --> 18:02.860]  If you have got a desiccant pack, not a Boveda pack, you want the opposite.
[18:02.860 --> 18:04.260]  Boveda helps you retain moisture.
[18:04.260 --> 18:06.580]  We want to eliminate moisture.
[18:06.580 --> 18:11.140]  That thing that comes in food, like beef jerky and shit, to suck out the moisture, it will
[18:11.140 --> 18:12.460]  come in your vitamin package.
[18:12.460 --> 18:15.620]  It comes in, sometimes if you buy a new bag or something, it will come with this little
[18:15.620 --> 18:16.620]  packet.
[18:16.620 --> 18:17.940]  That is to suck out moisture.
[18:17.940 --> 18:19.300]  That's what we want.
[18:19.300 --> 18:20.740]  Moisture will destroy pollen.
[18:20.740 --> 18:22.260]  It will make your pollen clumpy.
[18:22.260 --> 18:23.680]  It will make it dark yellow.
[18:23.680 --> 18:24.680]  It will not be viable.
[18:24.680 --> 18:26.580]  So, let's get it super dry.
[18:26.580 --> 18:29.780]  Also, before you store it, pick out all of those male flowers.
[18:29.780 --> 18:32.280]  You're going to see little male flower clusters in there.
[18:32.280 --> 18:37.600]  Get all of those out because those have moisture and they will harbor moisture, which will
[18:37.600 --> 18:42.400]  attribute and contribute to moldy conditions in your storage container.
[18:42.400 --> 18:43.520]  So gather up that pollen.
[18:43.520 --> 18:46.240]  You can use the drumstick and the Pyrex dish method.
[18:46.240 --> 18:49.480]  You can just bend that plant over and shake it into your dish if that's what you want
[18:49.480 --> 18:52.040]  to do, but pollen is going to go every direction.
[18:52.040 --> 18:54.640]  When you do this, turn off the fans.
[18:54.640 --> 18:57.240]  Help yourself out because that fan is going to blow dust everywhere.
[18:57.240 --> 19:00.940]  Or if you think that the plant has gone long enough, you can cut the tops off and put those
[19:00.940 --> 19:03.260]  tops in the dish and let them dry.
[19:03.260 --> 19:06.100]  Get it bone dry before you seal it up.
[19:06.100 --> 19:07.100]  Then store that pollen.
[19:07.100 --> 19:08.780]  I don't know how long your pollen will last.
[19:08.780 --> 19:10.460]  I've done a few experiments.
[19:10.460 --> 19:13.580]  I don't want to lead you astray and say that it will last more than six months.
[19:13.580 --> 19:15.060]  I've had pollen for six months.
[19:15.060 --> 19:17.260]  I've had pollen for a year and it worked.
[19:17.260 --> 19:18.500]  I had pollen for two years.
[19:18.500 --> 19:19.500]  It did not work.
[19:19.500 --> 19:24.900]  So, I'm going to say gather your pollen, get it super dry, seal it, keep it in a cool,
[19:24.900 --> 19:26.540]  dry, dark place.
[19:26.540 --> 19:27.540]  Dry, dry.
[19:27.540 --> 19:29.340]  Did I say dry enough times?
[19:29.340 --> 19:30.700]  Get the pollen dry.
[19:30.700 --> 19:33.020]  All right, now we've got pollen.
[19:33.020 --> 19:36.340]  Let's talk about actually pollinating our female plants.
[19:36.340 --> 19:42.060]  Like I said before, you could drag your reversed plant, your pollen donor over to the canopy.
[19:42.060 --> 19:45.440]  You can give it a shake or you can let it naturally blow across the canopy.
[19:45.440 --> 19:47.660]  Let it pollinate that way.
[19:47.660 --> 19:52.160]  Or you can select a couple of branches for your female plant and pollinate just a few
[19:52.160 --> 19:55.900]  branches if you're very careful.
[19:55.900 --> 20:00.140]  I would have the pollen in a small container, maybe like a glass vial.
[20:00.140 --> 20:02.340]  Back in the day, we would use a black film canister.
[20:02.340 --> 20:03.900]  We've evolved since then.
[20:03.900 --> 20:07.520]  But a vial, a container of some sort with pollen in it.
[20:07.520 --> 20:12.060]  If you can, remove the female plant that you're going to pollinate from the room.
[20:12.060 --> 20:16.980]  Once you've got your female pollen receiver in a safe place, get the pollen out of your
[20:16.980 --> 20:17.980]  container.
[20:17.980 --> 20:18.980]  You can use a Q-tip.
[20:18.980 --> 20:20.380]  You can use a paintbrush.
[20:20.380 --> 20:21.940]  I've seen a lot of different ways to do it.
[20:21.940 --> 20:26.860]  I've seen people simply take a vial of pollen and sprinkle it right over the top of the
[20:26.860 --> 20:27.860]  plant.
[20:27.860 --> 20:30.660]  Like if this microphone was a plant and this, I'm going to use the pen.
[20:30.660 --> 20:32.060]  It's the easiest thing I've got.
[20:32.060 --> 20:34.020]  This pen cap was a vial of pollen.
[20:34.020 --> 20:37.420]  They just took it and went tink, tink, tink, tink, and did a few circles around it and
[20:37.420 --> 20:38.680]  then went lower.
[20:38.680 --> 20:40.160]  Or you can just pollinate one branch.
[20:40.160 --> 20:44.140]  If you're super careful, you can grab a branch of the plant, bend it over this way, get it
[20:44.140 --> 20:47.100]  right here and just go.
[20:47.100 --> 20:50.400]  And then you know that this branch right here is going to make a bunch of seeds.
[20:50.400 --> 20:55.160]  You can make plenty of seeds from a really small bud, a really small branch.
[20:55.160 --> 20:57.080]  A good idea at this point may be to mark it.
[20:57.080 --> 21:01.520]  If you've got a bread tie, a ribbon, anything you can put on this branch and say, this is
[21:01.520 --> 21:02.920]  where I pollinated.
[21:02.920 --> 21:06.040]  Now you know that your seeds are going to be there when it comes to harvest time.
[21:06.040 --> 21:08.080]  You could possibly harvest the rest of the plant.
[21:08.080 --> 21:10.000]  If you are careful, it won't be seeded.
[21:10.000 --> 21:13.040]  And this one branch will have seeds for your next project.
[21:13.040 --> 21:15.880]  You can grow your own stuff, have a little bit of fun with that.
[21:15.880 --> 21:18.200]  So you can use a paintbrush, a Q-tip.
[21:18.200 --> 21:19.200]  You could dust it.
[21:19.200 --> 21:22.840]  Dip the paintbrush or Q-tip into the pollen and paint it onto the bud.
[21:22.840 --> 21:23.840]  Paint the pistils.
[21:23.840 --> 21:24.840]  Watch the pistils.
[21:24.840 --> 21:25.840]  Is that where we are?
[21:25.840 --> 21:28.120]  Yeah, watch the pistils.
[21:28.120 --> 21:32.380]  When those pistils get, you can identify that the plant has been pollinated by the pistils
[21:32.380 --> 21:35.800]  or stigmas being brown and shriveled.
[21:35.800 --> 21:37.400]  That part will become a seed.
[21:37.400 --> 21:41.360]  And then it says you can make a lot of seeds with tiny, tiny plants.
[21:41.360 --> 21:44.680]  Don't waste a lot of time and space making seeds for your first time.
[21:44.680 --> 21:47.040]  We don't know if these seeds are going to be any good.
[21:47.040 --> 21:51.200]  So the first time you make seeds, maybe only make 20, 30, maybe 50 of them to test them
[21:51.200 --> 21:53.120]  out and see if they're worth a shit.
[21:53.120 --> 21:57.200]  Don't seed up your whole crop and then they got a bunch of seeds that aren't stellar.
[21:57.200 --> 22:01.320]  Our job as a breeder is to make seeds that are better than both of the parents.
[22:01.320 --> 22:05.040]  If you didn't improve upon the cannabis line or if you didn't reach a goal that you were
[22:05.040 --> 22:07.560]  trying to reach, then we didn't do ourselves any justice.
[22:07.560 --> 22:08.880]  We didn't do any good for the plant.
[22:08.880 --> 22:10.440]  We're moving backwards.
[22:10.440 --> 22:16.160]  So you can make yourselves a lot of seeds in a very small, like a closet or a micro
[22:16.280 --> 22:17.280]  grow space.
[22:17.280 --> 22:18.280]  You can make a lot of seeds.
[22:18.280 --> 22:20.880]  I've bred seeds in six inch net pots.
[22:20.880 --> 22:25.000]  All you need is a big enough plant to receive pollen and a big enough plant to drop pollen.
[22:25.000 --> 22:26.520]  You can make seeds.
[22:26.520 --> 22:30.280]  So pollinate some plants, let the pollen take.
[22:30.280 --> 22:31.680]  Then here's a useful tip.
[22:31.680 --> 22:34.900]  I keep saying water deactivates pollen.
[22:34.900 --> 22:39.000]  When you are tossing pollen around, if you don't want all of your plants to get pollen,
[22:39.000 --> 22:41.120]  spray them with water before you get the pollen out.
[22:41.120 --> 22:44.920]  Just moisten them up, make it damp in the room, wet those plants, get the other plants,
[22:44.920 --> 22:49.720]  do your pollen chucking, let the pollen take, maybe rinse that plant off after the, just
[22:49.720 --> 22:54.360]  mist it with water, kill any excess pollen that didn't get absorbed by the pistils or
[22:54.360 --> 22:58.320]  by the female plant, get the pollen off of there, then spray the other females, then
[22:58.320 --> 22:59.960]  put everybody back in the room together.
[22:59.960 --> 23:05.100]  And then you should prevent pollen contamination on the plants you did not want seeded.
[23:05.100 --> 23:06.440]  Water deactivates pollen.
[23:06.440 --> 23:10.120]  There are so many useful tricks to use water to keep your other plants safe.
[23:10.120 --> 23:12.480]  So you can spray the other females.
[23:12.480 --> 23:16.200]  You can spray anything you don't want to get seeded that may help you out.
[23:16.200 --> 23:19.360]  So rinse them off before you put them back in there, spray the other girls, you should
[23:19.360 --> 23:20.360]  be safe.
[23:20.360 --> 23:22.840]  Now here's something I want to talk about.
[23:22.840 --> 23:25.120]  Don't harvest the seeds too early.
[23:25.120 --> 23:26.200]  How do we know when they're done?
[23:26.200 --> 23:30.200]  The seeds will probably take about six weeks to finish.
[23:30.200 --> 23:35.920]  I usually harvest around day 70, sometimes 77 when my plants are seeded.
[23:35.920 --> 23:40.000]  What I like to do to make sure that my seeds are ready is I start doing what I call a squeeze
[23:40.000 --> 23:41.360]  test.
[23:41.360 --> 23:44.680]  I seed up pretty large plants so I can risk a few seeds.
[23:44.680 --> 23:49.560]  What I do, right where the nodes are kind of intersecting, right at the bottom, you
[23:49.560 --> 23:54.440]  can see the bracts, the pistils, or the calyx, you can see the bracts or the calyx all swollen
[23:54.440 --> 23:55.980]  up and there's a seed in there.
[23:55.980 --> 23:57.320]  Just reach up and pluck a seed out.
[23:57.320 --> 23:58.360]  You're not going to ruin too much.
[23:58.360 --> 24:00.360]  You might pull out one or two seeds.
[24:00.360 --> 24:04.240]  Pull out a seed, give it a squeeze, roll it around in your fingers, knock off that hole
[24:04.240 --> 24:07.160]  or the husk of the seed, examine the seed.
[24:07.160 --> 24:08.200]  What color is it?
[24:08.200 --> 24:09.200]  Is it white?
[24:09.200 --> 24:10.200]  Is it light green?
[24:10.200 --> 24:11.200]  Is it turning brown?
[24:11.240 --> 24:12.240]  Is it a little bit understriped?
[24:12.240 --> 24:13.240]  Is it gray?
[24:13.240 --> 24:15.680]  Does it look like a seed that you think would be viable?
[24:15.680 --> 24:17.140]  Then here's the next test.
[24:17.140 --> 24:18.520]  Give it a squeeze.
[24:18.520 --> 24:21.580]  That seed should not break under the pressure of your fingers.
[24:21.580 --> 24:23.320]  If it cracks, it's not ready.
[24:23.320 --> 24:25.960]  If it does not crack, you're getting very close.
[24:25.960 --> 24:29.240]  I like to pull the seeds when they're good and hard and I can push them on the table
[24:29.240 --> 24:32.520]  and they do not rupture under the pressure of my finger.
[24:32.520 --> 24:37.000]  I've got a nice, I almost have an indention and a callus on this finger from pressing
[24:37.000 --> 24:39.480]  so many seeds onto this table.
[24:39.480 --> 24:40.480]  That's how I test them.
[24:40.760 --> 24:44.640]  I'll simply pull out a few and I'll do this from multiple locations on the plant.
[24:44.640 --> 24:47.480]  I don't just pick the top because that's obvious, right?
[24:47.480 --> 24:49.240]  That's getting the most light, the most energy.
[24:49.240 --> 24:51.320]  Let's do a few spots on the plant.
[24:51.320 --> 24:55.300]  Sometimes, just like trichomes, the tops of the plant, the seeds are ready and the bottom
[24:55.300 --> 24:57.280]  needs to keep going.
[24:57.280 --> 25:01.120]  Sometimes in the greenhouse, in the grow space, some of the plant seeds are ready earlier
[25:01.120 --> 25:02.380]  than others.
[25:02.380 --> 25:06.520]  The seeds that come from the platinum tangy are always done sooner than the seeds that
[25:06.520 --> 25:07.920]  come from strawberry starburst.
[25:07.920 --> 25:10.360]  I always know that that will be a thing.
[25:11.240 --> 25:15.800]  That saves me the headache of having to cut down those two plants at the same time.
[25:15.800 --> 25:20.560]  I know that if I run a large crop of platinum tangy that I can cut that down seven to 10
[25:20.560 --> 25:23.760]  days earlier than anything made with the strawberry fields.
[25:23.760 --> 25:25.360]  I said strawberry starburst earlier.
[25:25.360 --> 25:28.640]  Sorry, I may have transposed those but I do mix that up in my brain a lot.
[25:28.640 --> 25:32.280]  I know that the timing there, I can help myself out by staggering those because they won't
[25:32.280 --> 25:33.560]  be done for a week apart.
[25:33.560 --> 25:38.320]  I can get the one down, dried, get it chopped up into small pieces and then move the other
[25:38.320 --> 25:40.000]  one in and they can change places.
[25:40.640 --> 25:44.960]  They can rotate in my process, in my processing so I don't have to do it all at one time.
[25:44.960 --> 25:46.520]  So pull the seeds out, see if they're ripe.
[25:46.520 --> 25:48.520]  That's what I'm getting at there.
[25:48.520 --> 25:52.120]  You'll start developing the eye and the feel to know if the seeds are ready.
[25:52.120 --> 25:54.640]  If you leave them too long, they'll get too hard.
[25:54.640 --> 25:58.000]  If you take them too early, they won't be viable.
[25:58.000 --> 26:02.100]  Find some of your seeds are going to be done earlier than others in one plant.
[26:02.100 --> 26:03.100]  Find that law of averages.
[26:03.100 --> 26:06.360]  Do you have enough that are done that it's time to cut down the plant or do you want
[26:06.360 --> 26:08.960]  to wait longer and let some get too hard?
[26:08.960 --> 26:09.960]  That's the timing to be done.
[26:10.920 --> 26:12.960]  If you're only making 30 or 40 seeds, cut them down around day 70.
[26:12.960 --> 26:13.960]  They should be ready.
[26:13.960 --> 26:18.800]  Now, let's talk a little bit more specifically about the timing of using our spray solution.
[26:18.800 --> 26:23.520]  I'm going to say it one more time because I may have gone too fast in the last episode.
[26:23.520 --> 26:30.480]  I like to spray my pollen donor seven to 10 days before I initiate flower.
[26:30.480 --> 26:36.040]  I do not initiate flower on my pollen donor and pollen receiver plants at the same time.
[26:36.040 --> 26:38.160]  That's the next thing we're going to talk about.
[26:38.320 --> 26:43.480]  I start spraying seven to 10 days before I flip my pollen donor.
[26:43.480 --> 26:46.600]  A week to 10 days, I'll give it a good spray.
[26:46.600 --> 26:49.040]  Then I will give that plant day one of flower.
[26:49.040 --> 26:52.040]  My schedule is set, 9 to 9 a.m. or p.m.
[26:52.040 --> 26:54.520]  Depends on which room I'm in, what I'm doing.
[26:54.520 --> 26:56.280]  Nine a.m. that light comes on.
[26:56.280 --> 27:01.200]  About 8.45, I go grab the pollen donor plants and I spray them for the first time.
[27:01.200 --> 27:03.000]  Then the light goes off at nine o'clock.
[27:03.000 --> 27:05.200]  This is day one of flower.
[27:05.200 --> 27:08.400]  We get sprayed seven to 10 days before flower.
[27:08.400 --> 27:10.960]  Then we get sprayed day one of flower.
[27:10.960 --> 27:13.720]  Here is the schedule that I follow.
[27:13.720 --> 27:25.920]  I spray my silver solution on day one, day three, day six, day nine, day 12, 15, 18,
[27:25.920 --> 27:27.760]  and 21.
[27:27.760 --> 27:31.520]  At this point, I will start making game time decisions.
[27:31.520 --> 27:34.160]  Do I need to spray again on 25?
[27:34.160 --> 27:36.600]  Do I need to spray again on 27?
[27:36.600 --> 27:39.680]  I have never sprayed after day 30, to be honest with you.
[27:39.680 --> 27:41.800]  Sometimes the plants are stubborn.
[27:41.800 --> 27:44.400]  If you've got a stubborn plant, you may need to go longer.
[27:44.400 --> 27:46.440]  By now, we should start seeing pollen.
[27:46.440 --> 27:48.360]  Let's talk about that.
[27:48.360 --> 27:54.480]  The male will start making pollen around day 30 or 35-ish.
[27:54.480 --> 28:00.400]  This is going to be plant-specific, light-specific, phenotype-specific, environment-specific.
[28:00.400 --> 28:02.680]  I'm saying ish.
[28:02.680 --> 28:08.400]  I'm going to say day 28 to 37-ish is when you'll get your pollen.
[28:08.400 --> 28:14.240]  The females will be ready for their pollen around day 25 to day 30.
[28:14.240 --> 28:15.400]  There's a word problem.
[28:15.400 --> 28:17.560]  There's some algebra to be done there.
[28:17.560 --> 28:23.240]  Let me tell you again, expect pollen between days 30 and 35.
[28:23.240 --> 28:28.680]  Expect females to be ready around day 25 to day 30.
[28:28.680 --> 28:30.200]  There's more stuff to talk about.
[28:30.200 --> 28:34.640]  Don't bump your pollen donor plants when they're making pollen because that will knock
[28:34.640 --> 28:37.840]  the pollen out early.
[28:37.840 --> 28:40.440]  They won't have as much stuff to knock up your females.
[28:40.440 --> 28:43.880]  Also, that dust may travel to the females and pollinate them early.
[28:43.880 --> 28:47.880]  If they get hit too early, you won't make as many seeds as you could have.
[28:47.880 --> 28:52.420]  One piece of advice that I use to set my rhythm, I say that the females are going to be ready
[28:52.420 --> 28:54.920]  for pollen around day 25 to 30.
[28:54.920 --> 28:58.440]  The dude is going to start making pollen around 30 to 35.
[28:58.440 --> 29:03.120]  The way that I set my rhythm, when I see those pollen donor plants showing me that
[29:03.120 --> 29:07.600]  they are truly reversing, this is a kind of a fail-safe way.
[29:07.600 --> 29:09.960]  Sometimes your silver solution isn't perfect.
[29:09.960 --> 29:14.000]  Sometimes your spray intervals, dilutions, ratios, timing aren't right for the cultivar
[29:14.000 --> 29:15.780]  you've chosen to reverse.
[29:15.780 --> 29:21.640]  What I do, I wait until I see that female plant showing me true signs of successful
[29:21.640 --> 29:26.200]  reversal before I drag my female plants into the flower room.
[29:26.200 --> 29:28.380]  This does a couple things.
[29:28.380 --> 29:29.940]  First of all, it sets up the timing.
[29:29.940 --> 29:35.140]  I know that once I see that part start developing, I know I'm just the right time away for that
[29:35.140 --> 29:39.060]  plant to give me pollen or the girls are going to get timed up just right.
[29:39.060 --> 29:44.260]  Also, this helps me not put female plants into flower when I don't have a pollen donor
[29:44.260 --> 29:45.260]  coming.
[29:45.260 --> 29:49.700]  If I failed, if I didn't make my silver solution properly, if I didn't reverse at the right
[29:49.700 --> 29:53.900]  time, spray correctly, if I done fucked up, I've got a backup plan.
[29:53.900 --> 29:55.780]  I still have my females and veg.
[29:55.780 --> 30:00.740]  I can get that pollen donor plant and do other tricks and methods and tactics to try
[30:00.740 --> 30:01.740]  to reverse it.
[30:01.740 --> 30:05.740]  That way I don't just have plants in there flowering, not making seeds, scrambling, trying
[30:05.740 --> 30:09.060]  to figure shit out because I've been there, won't do it again.
[30:09.060 --> 30:10.060]  That sucks.
[30:10.060 --> 30:12.540]  I'm better than that at this point and so are you.
[30:12.540 --> 30:13.840]  Set yourself up for success.
[30:13.840 --> 30:18.940]  Wait until you see that pollen donor plant showing successful signs of reversal.
[30:18.940 --> 30:21.780]  Then drag those female plants in there.
[30:21.780 --> 30:23.220]  Then here comes the next part.
[30:23.220 --> 30:29.660]  We're going to harvest our seeds around day 70 or 75, maybe day 77.
[30:29.660 --> 30:33.540]  I'm going to do a full episode in the future about harvesting seeds.
[30:33.540 --> 30:37.660]  This will account for feminized seeds, regular seeds, auto flower seeds.
[30:37.660 --> 30:38.660]  This is universal.
[30:38.660 --> 30:41.680]  However you're going to harvest seeds, this will work.
[30:41.680 --> 30:47.220]  Get those female plants, get the male plants, the pollen donors about seven to 15 days ahead.
[30:47.220 --> 30:49.660]  Expect pollen around day 30 to 35.
[30:49.660 --> 30:53.820]  Get the females ready for pollen around day 25 to 30.
[30:53.820 --> 30:54.820]  Pollinate.
[30:54.820 --> 30:56.460]  I don't know if you're going to do an open pollination where you're going to drag that
[30:56.460 --> 30:58.580]  pollen donor in there and just let it skeet.
[30:58.580 --> 31:01.780]  I don't know if you're going to cut down the top and walk around and beat the females with
[31:01.780 --> 31:02.780]  it.
[31:02.780 --> 31:05.680]  I don't know if you're going to gather pollen and then get the girls going at another time
[31:05.680 --> 31:06.680]  and sprinkle them.
[31:06.680 --> 31:09.620]  I don't know your tactic, but do some pollen chucking.
[31:09.620 --> 31:12.060]  Get in there, get that pollen going on the girls.
[31:12.060 --> 31:16.100]  Then be patient and wait.
[31:16.100 --> 31:17.460]  Let's talk briefly about feeding.
[31:17.460 --> 31:19.100]  I don't have any notes about feeding.
[31:19.100 --> 31:20.700]  I didn't write that down.
[31:20.700 --> 31:21.780]  We should talk about that.
[31:21.780 --> 31:23.940]  The seeded plants are going to want more nutrients.
[31:23.940 --> 31:28.300]  I feed my seeded plants basically a souped up veg mix.
[31:28.300 --> 31:30.380]  I feed what I'm feeding my veg plants.
[31:30.380 --> 31:32.060]  I do add amino acids.
[31:32.060 --> 31:35.900]  I add a liquid amino product from, what's that company called?
[31:35.900 --> 31:36.900]  It'll come to me.
[31:36.900 --> 31:37.900]  You know who they are.
[31:37.900 --> 31:38.900]  All right.
[31:38.900 --> 31:42.060]  The company my brain would not bring to my mind is called Microbe Life Hydroponics.
[31:42.060 --> 31:43.060]  They make great stuff.
[31:43.060 --> 31:44.580]  They make an amino product that I use.
[31:44.580 --> 31:47.260]  I also like that photosynthesis plus.
[31:47.260 --> 31:48.260]  Good shit.
[31:48.420 --> 31:49.580]  I add that photos to my seeded crops.
[31:49.580 --> 31:52.940]  I also step up the cow mag and a little bit of the nitrogen.
[31:52.940 --> 31:55.060]  I don't focus on bud boosters.
[31:55.060 --> 32:00.560]  I will shift later on to the flowering feed, but I don't focus on bud boosters like we
[32:00.560 --> 32:03.620]  do when we're making buds because I'm not making buds.
[32:03.620 --> 32:04.620]  I'm making seeds.
[32:04.620 --> 32:07.660]  I'm focused on making the building blocks for life.
[32:07.660 --> 32:11.980]  I do believe that a little bit of those amino acids, a lot of nitrogen, basic nutrients
[32:11.980 --> 32:14.380]  will help us out with that.
[32:14.500 --> 32:19.460]  Somebody asked what kind of thiosol of the, uh, I am using the anhydrous version.
[32:19.460 --> 32:22.060]  The crystalline anhydrous is what I am using.
[32:22.060 --> 32:27.380]  I honestly think that answers all of the questions that I had written down in a future episode.
[32:27.380 --> 32:30.980]  I am again going to talk about the harvesting of the seeds.
[32:30.980 --> 32:32.500]  So you've got some time to go.
[32:32.500 --> 32:33.740]  Let your seeds grow.
[32:33.740 --> 32:38.540]  The next time we check in, we'll talk about cutting down your seeded cannabis plants.
[32:38.540 --> 32:43.400]  If they're feminize seeds, regular seeds, auto flowers, maybe it's just hemp.
[32:43.400 --> 32:45.840]  We'll teach you how to cut them down, get those seeds out of there.
[32:45.840 --> 32:48.560]  That is a tedious task if you're not prepared properly.
[32:48.560 --> 32:50.640]  All right, that is all I've got for you.
[32:50.640 --> 32:53.680]  That is the update to the silver thiosulfate episode.
