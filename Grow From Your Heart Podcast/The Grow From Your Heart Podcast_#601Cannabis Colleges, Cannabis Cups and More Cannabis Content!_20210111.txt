[01:38.240 --> 01:43.260]  Podcast does come from a patreon contributor. They did send me a very nice set of questions
[01:43.260 --> 01:47.080]  So with no further ado, let's just jump right into it. This one comes from our friend
[01:47.080 --> 01:47.520]  Mr
[01:47.520 --> 01:54.800]  And it says growers love and greetings and salutations to you white Mike and all of the irie army big salute to the full
[01:54.800 --> 02:00.640]  Irie army. Thank you for joining us. Mr. This is a great question. It goes on to say what a year
[02:00.640 --> 02:05.640]  I have developed a pair of green thumbs. I celebrated being a 20-year cancer survivor
[02:06.200 --> 02:10.440]  Congratulations, brother. It says I was 24 when I was diagnosed. I'm glad you're making it this far
[02:10.440 --> 02:13.440]  Keep killing it if we can do anything, let us know it goes on
[02:13.440 --> 02:18.840]  It says I continue my life journey now having over 18 months without any form of pain pills
[02:19.000 --> 02:24.480]  So it sounds like with cannabis we have eliminated pain pills from mrs. Life and it has been over 18 months
[02:25.240 --> 02:29.280]  Congratulations. That is a huge improvement in life. That's a huge step. Keep going
[02:29.280 --> 02:33.620]  Like I said before if you need anything, just let us know we'll do our best to help you out now
[02:33.620 --> 02:37.160]  It says my questions this month are vast and various
[02:37.160 --> 02:39.480]  Let's turn down some of this music and get right to mrs
[02:39.800 --> 02:44.600]  Questions because he does have a lot of them this could take a minute it says for 2021
[02:44.600 --> 02:48.440]  I mean I am interested in obtaining a cannabis horticultural
[02:48.840 --> 02:55.120]  Certificate something like oakster damn live or an online class and I'm interested in your thoughts about a novice cultivator
[02:55.120 --> 03:01.960]  Or someone wanting to get into the cannabis industry and looking into any cannabis college. That is a great question
[03:01.960 --> 03:03.960]  There are a lot of online
[03:04.120 --> 03:09.240]  Cannabis education programs available during Kovach. I'm sure all of them are online before Kovach
[03:09.240 --> 03:11.640]  You could go to cloverleaf. You could go to oakster. Damn
[03:11.640 --> 03:17.220]  There are a couple other accredited cannabis universities, which you could attend and get a cannabis education
[03:17.440 --> 03:19.680]  You can get a general cannabis education
[03:19.680 --> 03:22.960]  Then they do have more focused classes where you can learn about bud tending
[03:23.200 --> 03:28.360]  Cultivating the back end of the business the tax end of the business the legal aspects of the business
[03:28.360 --> 03:31.760]  They will teach you so many things in these college classes. I
[03:32.480 --> 03:37.120]  Am all about continuing education. I'm here to educate. I'm here to teach people
[03:37.120 --> 03:42.440]  I'm all about furthering your education broadening your horizons setting yourself up for success
[03:43.240 --> 03:48.020]  Education is key. However, sometimes those places will teach you bad habits
[03:48.080 --> 03:51.200]  So go to those classes with an open mind
[03:51.360 --> 03:56.120]  Understand that the things they are not teaching you are not the only way to do things. That is a problem
[03:56.120 --> 04:01.400]  I see a lot of cultivators have that come from those types of facilities or come from even college courses or
[04:01.760 --> 04:05.120]  Another facility they were taught that this is how I cut clones
[04:05.200 --> 04:10.240]  So this is the only way we can cut clones and if you come to work for me
[04:10.240 --> 04:15.000]  You're gonna cut clones the way I teach you and the way they taught you in Amsterdam may be way different
[04:15.000 --> 04:18.640]  And I don't want to hear you arguing with me that well in Amsterdam. We did our at oakster
[04:18.640 --> 04:19.640]  Damn, we did it this way
[04:19.640 --> 04:23.440]  I'm gonna fire you because I don't care we do it this way at my girl and it works this way
[04:23.440 --> 04:27.480]  I'll listen to you once we did it this way at oakster. Damn. Cool
[04:27.480 --> 04:31.640]  I've heard you now quit trying to change our ways and let's do it the way we've written SOPs for
[04:31.760 --> 04:34.520]  And the way we've got it dialed in here in this cultivation facility
[04:34.520 --> 04:35.920]  So I do like the schooling
[04:35.920 --> 04:40.320]  But keep an open mind that it is not the only way to do things what they teach you
[04:40.320 --> 04:41.960]  There is a way to do things
[04:41.960 --> 04:48.560]  You'll get a very vast and deep understanding of the plants of the plant functions of ways to take care of the plants the processes
[04:48.560 --> 04:50.120]  of the plants
[04:50.120 --> 04:54.240]  Environmental tips and all kinds of things that I probably don't even know but at the same time
[04:54.240 --> 04:54.880]  I
[04:54.880 --> 04:57.760]  Like to be able to train somebody that comes into a facility
[04:58.040 --> 05:02.080]  To work in my facility the way I need it done a little bit of plant knowledge is cool
[05:02.080 --> 05:07.280]  But if you go to one of those universities and learn too much, you know, just enough to fuck something up in my grow
[05:07.280 --> 05:09.280]  So if you do go to that
[05:09.720 --> 05:16.000]  Remember that you're not getting the the total 100% only way answer you're getting a very good education
[05:16.000 --> 05:21.360]  But you've got to keep yourself open-minded that there are other things to learn if you do go to something like that
[05:21.360 --> 05:26.080]  I recommend focusing on something find your niche in cannabis. What are you gonna do?
[05:26.560 --> 05:28.920]  Everybody starts off they want to become a good grower
[05:29.040 --> 05:34.040]  They understand the plants then they understand the environment then we all kind of branch off into our own direction
[05:34.040 --> 05:40.780]  I obviously became a breeder and a podcaster some other people are really good in the grow also became HVAC technicians
[05:40.780 --> 05:46.200]  Some people also became electricians. Some people also become carpenters. Some people are really good at cloning
[05:46.200 --> 05:50.760]  Some people are all about phenol hunting find your niche in the cannabis industry
[05:50.760 --> 05:54.480]  And if you can focus your classes on that that will definitely help you out
[05:54.640 --> 06:02.240]  Maybe learn about pesticides and pesticide applications learn everything you can about pests be the pest guy the guy that eradicates problems
[06:02.440 --> 06:04.040]  I said a moment ago
[06:04.040 --> 06:10.840]  maybe learn about HVAC or electricity or even be a plumber or maybe you need to learn about the the tax laws and the
[06:10.960 --> 06:15.740]  Back end of the business all the technical stuff all the the accounting and the bookkeeping and all that stuff
[06:15.740 --> 06:21.200]  Maybe you need to learn all the logistics of that part. Maybe you're a salesman. Maybe you're in sales in the cannabis industry
[06:21.840 --> 06:28.920]  Whatever you do find your niche and try to find the cannabis schooling that will dial in your niche and give you a solid
[06:29.720 --> 06:34.380]  Foundation and some more to shine if you want so I it sounds like you're trying to get into the industry
[06:34.880 --> 06:38.500]  What are you going to do to shine in the industry? Do you have a goal?
[06:38.500 --> 06:43.200]  Do you have something you can bring to the industry? Are you a salesperson? Are you a crafts person?
[06:43.200 --> 06:47.540]  Are you a plumber an electrician an HVAC tech or do you simply want to grow the cannabis?
[06:47.700 --> 06:51.980]  Find what you want to do and get those classes and specialize in that stuff
[06:51.980 --> 06:56.340]  But then when you go to work for somebody don't be so stubborn that we have to fire you
[06:56.340 --> 07:00.440]  I've had amazing cultivators work in cultivation facilities with me
[07:00.440 --> 07:06.700]  I've worked with some amazing cultivators and I've had to fire them because I catch them doing it their way and not our way
[07:06.980 --> 07:10.340]  Your way works in your garden, but I've got a strategy
[07:10.340 --> 07:14.340]  I've got the map with the key and the legend and the starting point and the ending point
[07:14.340 --> 07:18.820]  I've got that on paper and if we don't follow my map, we're not all going to get to the same goal
[07:18.820 --> 07:23.460]  So if you're doing your weird shit in my garden, I come in I'm like, hey, why did this happen?
[07:23.460 --> 07:27.400]  You're like, oh I decided I would top the plants and do this. We weren't gonna top those plants
[07:27.400 --> 07:29.600]  I had a strategy now you just fucked up the whole garden
[07:29.620 --> 07:33.580]  Keep in mind that you've got to go adapt to somebody else's grow once you're hired
[07:33.580 --> 07:36.380]  It will give you a solid foundation if you want to run your own stuff
[07:36.380 --> 07:39.620]  This is a good way to start you'll get a full education that way
[07:39.620 --> 07:45.940]  But keep in mind if there's always more to learn once you think you've learned it all that's when you fuck yourself from learning anymore
[07:45.940 --> 07:47.220]  so
[07:47.220 --> 07:54.180]  You asked my thoughts about these non novice cultivator or someone wanting to get into the industry and looking at any cannabis college
[07:54.180 --> 08:00.620]  I think I covered that do it educate yourself, but keep in mind you did not learn everything and you've got to be open to the
[08:00.620 --> 08:04.100]  Teachings I'm gonna give you the training. I'm gonna give you when you work with me
[08:04.580 --> 08:09.340]  All right, there is another question it says I am a cannabis cup virgin
[08:09.980 --> 08:13.100]  Any word about the status of cannabis cups in 2021?
[08:13.460 --> 08:16.740]  This question brings up a thought on judging these events
[08:16.860 --> 08:20.620]  What was the criteria used to judge the cannabis entries at these events?
[08:20.620 --> 08:27.780]  Also a couple thoughts on possible ways to prevent someone buying or swaying votes is using. Oh another way of
[08:28.460 --> 08:31.180]  Swaying that is by using a double blind panel approach
[08:31.380 --> 08:36.460]  Then there's my favorite a veterans only panel a veterans only panel would be pretty awesome
[08:36.620 --> 08:39.580]  If you got like the veterans choice or something at one of those events
[08:39.660 --> 08:44.340]  That would be a cool new category to add to it and the only people able to vote in that were the veterans
[08:44.380 --> 08:49.580]  That'd be fucking pretty cool. I like that category if I ever do throw a cup or I am involved in a cup
[08:49.580 --> 08:53.300]  I will mention a veterans only category veterans choice
[08:54.100 --> 08:55.220]  Yeah veterans choice
[08:55.220 --> 08:59.740]  we get to try all that the veterans get to trial decided I mean to include myself in that the veterans get to try all
[08:59.740 --> 09:03.700]  Of the samples that were donated and the veterans get to say sample 42 was the winner
[09:03.700 --> 09:06.300]  I like that veterans choice award. That's kind of cool
[09:06.340 --> 09:10.360]  Now let me focus on the question because I am a little bit rambly today
[09:10.860 --> 09:15.020]  It says um any word on the status of cannabis cups in 2021
[09:15.740 --> 09:19.300]  So far no word no updates on any events like that
[09:19.300 --> 09:25.060]  I think everybody is waiting a lot of people are waiting for a vaccine and word from our fucking government
[09:25.060 --> 09:31.940]  We don't even know what we're allowed to do what we can do at this time. So I don't see any cannabis events in 2021 coming up
[09:33.020 --> 09:39.860]  Especially consumption events. I think it will be a very long time before we are smoking anything together in a room together
[09:40.740 --> 09:44.340]  I am on the fence about how I feel about the future of
[09:44.780 --> 09:49.060]  Events with Kovat and everything part of me wants to get out there and see all of my friends and
[09:49.580 --> 09:51.860]  Smoke and high-five everybody. I'm a business person
[09:51.860 --> 09:56.000]  I want to take my booth to the businesses where business happens and meet all of my people
[09:56.000 --> 10:00.280]  That's my favorite part of the events. I get to meet all of you that have been listening you come up and you're like Ross
[10:00.280 --> 10:02.280]  Jeff I've been listening to the show and thank you and that
[10:02.660 --> 10:05.720]  Recharges me for the next year. I would love to have all of that
[10:05.720 --> 10:10.260]  Also, I don't know that I want to get some weird fucking disease and get sick and get other people sick
[10:10.340 --> 10:14.080]  Anyway, I'm gonna get away from that political talk because we hear enough about that shit
[10:14.080 --> 10:16.240]  But I don't think they're going to be any events in
[10:16.720 --> 10:20.120]  2021 that I am aware of I did see a couple of things in a couple of places
[10:20.120 --> 10:24.680]  But I will not be attending them and they were very small events compared to like cannabis cups and things
[10:24.680 --> 10:29.160]  But there are very tiny smoke gatherings happening, but I'll be avoiding those for the time being
[10:30.840 --> 10:36.960]  Judging these events. Um, I do have some notes on that. Let's see. Let me jump into my notes judging
[10:38.080 --> 10:42.200]  It's been long rumored that many of the larger cups are for sale to be quite honest with you
[10:42.200 --> 10:45.700]  You do hear any event you go to anything where there's a prize
[10:45.700 --> 10:51.640]  You always hear that the cups the prizes and the awards are for sale and I did say rumored it is a rumor
[10:51.640 --> 10:55.560]  It's hearsay allegedly that some of those cups are for sale with that being said
[10:55.560 --> 10:59.240]  I know people personally who have sat not at this table
[10:59.240 --> 11:03.280]  But at the table that used to be in this spot that have sat here who have won
[11:03.640 --> 11:06.560]  Cannabis cups from high times and have won other
[11:07.080 --> 11:09.280]  First place awards from other prestigious
[11:09.920 --> 11:15.280]  Cannabis and concentrate events and competitions and I know that those people that won
[11:15.920 --> 11:21.880]  Simply don't have the money to buy an award. So I feel like those people won those awards fair and square
[11:21.880 --> 11:25.040]  I know them. I know their business. I'm friends with them
[11:25.040 --> 11:29.680]  I know what allegedly it would cost to win a cup and I know they don't have that kind of money
[11:29.680 --> 11:35.400]  so I know that my friends won those categories fair and square they won those events, but
[11:36.360 --> 11:39.240]  Sometimes some of the bigger ones it is questionable
[11:39.240 --> 11:42.120]  I don't want to point any fingers or anything, but it has definitely been questionable
[11:42.120 --> 11:44.680]  Sometimes you see the guys with the larger booths
[11:45.060 --> 11:50.680]  The largest presence they win and it seems like they just threw a bunch of money at the event and the event went well
[11:50.680 --> 11:54.960]  Yeah, you gave us enough money to host this whole event. So we're just gonna give you the awards sometimes
[11:54.960 --> 12:00.860]  That's what it feels like allegedly. I have no evidence toward that. I'm gonna talk myself out of that hole really quickly now
[12:01.860 --> 12:05.020]  Ideally judging is based on categories and subcategories
[12:05.620 --> 12:10.860]  So you're gonna have obviously a flower category, right and that's buds flowers buds dried buds
[12:11.340 --> 12:15.160]  People are gonna have a flower category in that category. You're gonna find indica
[12:15.160 --> 12:21.080]  You're gonna find a sativa and you're gonna find a hybrid category. Then you're gonna judge those categories on
[12:22.100 --> 12:29.300]  Basically looks smell flavor aromas the buzz you get from that when you smoke it. How the how does it burn?
[12:29.300 --> 12:33.580]  How is the burn ability does the ash come out chunky and black does the ash come out nice and white?
[12:33.580 --> 12:36.340]  Did it burn your throat when you smoked it? Did it make you cough?
[12:36.420 --> 12:39.500]  Did it give you weird cotton mouth did it have a weird flavor to it?
[12:39.500 --> 12:46.300]  A lot of that is gonna matter then also we're going to give it give it to a lab and let the lab test it
[12:46.300 --> 12:53.820]  I agree and disagree with labs testing our cannabis for competitions because I didn't grow my flower for a machine to smoke it
[12:53.820 --> 12:57.620]  I don't really care what the gas chromatography or liquid chromatography machine says
[12:57.620 --> 12:59.700]  I care what you say when you smoke it
[12:59.700 --> 13:06.460]  I've never seen a computer take a rip off a joint and go damn that was good shit or now that's not as good
[13:06.460 --> 13:09.660]  But I've seen some of my friends hit a joint and go that's not bad
[13:09.660 --> 13:14.500]  And I've seen him hit another joint and go damn. That's the one those are the ones we're trying to impress
[13:14.500 --> 13:19.420]  I'm not worried too much about the machines, but they do send samples to the lab. They do terpene analysis
[13:19.420 --> 13:21.420]  They do THC and CBD analysis
[13:21.420 --> 13:26.280]  They also check for pesticides and heavy metals and then they announce all of that along with the winners
[13:26.640 --> 13:29.840]  Oftentimes they will do a highest terpene winner, which is done with the labs
[13:29.840 --> 13:32.680]  They'll do a highest THC winner, which is done with the lab tests
[13:32.680 --> 13:36.880]  So that's another criteria for testing so it starts off with the flower category
[13:36.880 --> 13:38.920]  Then it breaks down into subcategories
[13:38.920 --> 13:43.800]  You got your indica your sativa your hybrid and then we judge those based on the criteria that I spoke of in
[13:44.040 --> 13:52.000]  Some events they will do an indoor category an outdoor category a greenhouse category and a fully organic category as well
[13:52.000 --> 13:58.440]  I don't know what's to stop people from saying that their indoor was grown outdoor their outdoor was grown indoor
[13:58.600 --> 14:03.120]  Hopefully everyone's just honest with that, but those are other opportunities and other categories that are available
[14:03.760 --> 14:12.160]  Another thing you see at the events a lot is concentrates. We judge concentrates. There's a concentrate competition usually best concentrate highest
[14:12.560 --> 14:15.600]  CBD concentrate and then a lot of these also there is a
[14:15.960 --> 14:19.620]  Crowds choice or a crowd favorite they give that a war out as well
[14:19.620 --> 14:25.660]  So when they do the concentrates we basically judge it off of what it looks like what it smells like what it tastes like
[14:26.580 --> 14:31.020]  Then the buzz is very important because you're smoking 40 samples in a day
[14:31.020 --> 14:34.580]  Did two of them stick out to you did one get you super buzz compared to the others?
[14:34.620 --> 14:39.720]  That's something you're looking for then. How does it react when you put it on the banger on the nail?
[14:39.720 --> 14:44.660]  However, you consume it. Does it sparkle up? Did it splatter up? Did it make a bunch of weird noises?
[14:44.660 --> 14:49.780]  Did it sizzle did it leave any char or residue on the banger? That is something to think about
[14:49.780 --> 14:56.220]  I like a good clean looking concentrate. I know what it's supposed to look like a nice color a nice texture a good aroma
[14:56.220 --> 14:59.420]  I want it to burn nicely on the rig. I don't want it to leave any residue
[14:59.420 --> 15:05.060]  I don't want it to taste funny. I don't want it to leave any weird aftertaste. I want it to have good pleasant
[15:05.740 --> 15:12.160]  Only cannabis derived terpenes left terpenes. They leave good flavors in my mouth is all I want to taste at the end of that
[15:12.160 --> 15:17.560]  I don't want any weird additives or weird flavor enhancers or anything. I don't want it to leave weird shit on my banger
[15:17.560 --> 15:20.740]  I want my rig to be clean and ready for another dab after that dab
[15:20.860 --> 15:23.900]  That is a winning concentrate if I hit it and I go damn that tastes good
[15:23.900 --> 15:28.220]  I'm high as fuck and my rig isn't all dirty from it. That's a good concentrate right there
[15:28.220 --> 15:31.560]  So that's what we're looking for when it comes to judging judging concentrates
[15:31.660 --> 15:38.860]  you will find several categories of concentrates based on your your location the region of the event and
[15:39.040 --> 15:45.260]  Some newer places you're gonna get like solvent and non-solvent concentrates. That's what you're gonna find and that's gonna be
[15:46.300 --> 15:48.700]  solvent is anything like BHO or
[15:49.580 --> 15:55.360]  Hexane or propane derived concentrates. That's all solvent derived concentrates when they say non-solvent
[15:55.360 --> 16:02.520]  That does include water hash and sift and any type of bubble hash and maybe even pressed hash at this point would go into there
[16:02.680 --> 16:04.000]  Now, let me give a disclaimer
[16:04.000 --> 16:09.560]  I did just say that non-solvent hash is water hash and people are going to say but Rostachev water is a
[16:09.700 --> 16:14.260]  Solvent our friend Nikita taught us that in the process of making bubble hash
[16:14.340 --> 16:18.040]  Water is not used as a solvent because it is not dissolving the trichomes
[16:18.040 --> 16:23.220]  It is used as an agitator a separating agent and it is washing the trichomes from the product
[16:23.220 --> 16:26.880]  So yes, I do understand the science that water is a solvent in this case
[16:26.880 --> 16:31.960]  The product we are using is not water soluble. So it is not being a solvent type product in this option
[16:31.960 --> 16:38.200]  It is washing is being used as an agitator as a separating agent a little bit different than a solvent there
[16:38.200 --> 16:40.640]  So it does count as a non-solvent product
[16:40.780 --> 16:47.120]  Shout out to Nikita for teaching us the difference between solvent and non-solvent concentrates and why water is not a solvent
[16:47.360 --> 16:52.040]  All right. Also in that category you may see diamonds. You may see sauce
[16:52.040 --> 16:54.960]  You may see a lot of other different types of concentrates
[16:54.960 --> 16:59.040]  I said basting on based on your location and your region here in Colorado
[16:59.040 --> 17:04.360]  We've had legalization for quite a while the race is on we've all been trying to find the best concentrates
[17:04.360 --> 17:09.340]  Everyone's trying to make the best concentrates. So here you're gonna see different categories because it's available
[17:09.360 --> 17:14.220]  Maybe in a newer market all the concentrates haven't evolved because legalization hasn't been there
[17:14.220 --> 17:20.020]  The technology hasn't been there people haven't been striving and learning as much so you may just find smaller options
[17:20.020 --> 17:23.900]  You'll get your solvent and non-solvent concentrates. Also, you may see
[17:24.900 --> 17:26.260]  Carts
[17:26.260 --> 17:28.720]  cartridges cartridges filled with concentrates
[17:28.720 --> 17:35.200]  You'll find your best car your highest herp cart and highest THC and CBD carts will be available at a lot of the competitions
[17:35.200 --> 17:41.900]  Now because cartridges are becoming very popular. I think cartridges are about 50 to 70 percent of sales here in Colorado
[17:42.380 --> 17:47.240]  So there are a lot of carts out there carts are getting real popular. Also, you will see edibles
[17:47.240 --> 17:52.420]  They will have the best edible and highest CBD edible at the cannabis cups
[17:52.420 --> 17:54.420]  That's another competition that they will have
[17:55.180 --> 17:59.440]  Also, they will have best overall CBD product is something you'll also see
[17:59.540 --> 18:05.100]  So those are a lot of the con of the categories that you see at a cannabis cup. I'm gonna make sure I covered your questions
[18:05.940 --> 18:13.340]  What are the criteria? Yeah, we smoke it. We look at it. We make sure it's enjoyable basically ways to prevent someone buying or swaying votes
[18:14.580 --> 18:18.540]  Unfortunately, I don't know that that does not happen and I don't know how to stop it
[18:18.540 --> 18:21.860]  The best way to do it is to make everything based on public votes
[18:22.420 --> 18:28.340]  But we've seen what happens with voting and welcome to 2021. We're just gonna move forward from that statement. Um
[18:29.580 --> 18:34.040]  The veterans panel that's a fucking cool idea. Like I said before I agree with the veterans panel
[18:34.040 --> 18:37.260]  I would put you on the veterans panel and I would make sure that we had
[18:37.340 --> 18:40.780]  Plenty of good concentrates for the veterans and then you guys would leave with all the leftovers
[18:40.860 --> 18:45.820]  And all these competitions usually the people that throw it leave with the leftovers. We'll send it home with the veterans
[18:46.340 --> 18:49.660]  Alright, that is part two of a long question
[18:49.660 --> 18:52.140]  Let's jump into part three and see how far we get through this
[18:52.140 --> 18:55.540]  I may have to save a couple for another episode because this is getting quite long
[18:55.940 --> 19:02.740]  Number three on mister's question says your thoughts about kovats impact on the cannabis industry and the future of cannabis cups
[19:02.740 --> 19:08.860]  Are you noticing any pandemic proof aspects in the industry and the cannabis business or community?
[19:09.700 --> 19:13.880]  So my thoughts on kovats impact on the cannabis industry and the future of cups
[19:14.880 --> 19:19.840]  The impact on the industry we have been selling record numbers of cannabis
[19:20.160 --> 19:25.000]  People when they were stuck at home during quarantine when they couldn't go out and do things people were smoking
[19:25.760 --> 19:28.560]  Tremendous amounts of cannabis. So in the industry
[19:29.080 --> 19:32.920]  We saw a lot of cannabis sold now the future of cannabis cups
[19:32.920 --> 19:36.360]  I said before I don't know how long until people are gonna be comfortable
[19:36.360 --> 19:42.520]  Especially myself going out and smoking and doing stuff like that. I'd love to get out there, but I've got mixed emotions
[19:43.000 --> 19:48.920]  An event would draw a large crowd and large crowds are kind of what we're against so I wouldn't be there for a while
[19:49.960 --> 19:55.920]  Also at the start of the pandemic a lot of people started growing. So a lot of people started buying seeds
[19:55.920 --> 19:58.140]  I don't want to say that anything is recession proof
[19:58.560 --> 20:00.560]  But it feels like when things go
[20:00.600 --> 20:07.080]  Things go weird people turn to things that make them feel better and cannabis is one of the things that makes people feel better
[20:07.360 --> 20:10.560]  Also people had to think about their budgets. They can't buy as much cannabis
[20:10.560 --> 20:16.760]  They want to smoke more they turn to growing so I did see an influx of new growers and seed
[20:16.920 --> 20:22.000]  Buyers at the start so I can't say anything's recession proof, but the seed business did not slow down
[20:22.400 --> 20:24.400]  We are still adjusting
[20:24.400 --> 20:29.280]  Nothing is stable at this point. So I don't want to say that the industry is recession proof
[20:29.280 --> 20:32.640]  I don't want to say that the seed business will keep going
[20:32.640 --> 20:39.840]  But as the adjustment has happened things have been well for my end of the industry, but what works this month may not work next month
[20:39.840 --> 20:43.800]  We one day we're able to go eat at restaurants the next day. We're not allowed to eat at restaurants one day
[20:43.800 --> 20:46.200]  We're allowed to shop in the dispensary the next day. We have to do it outside
[20:46.840 --> 20:48.840]  Things are weird. So I don't know
[20:49.200 --> 20:55.600]  The whole idea of job security disappeared. So I don't know things are kind of weird like kind of rambling on that one
[20:57.600 --> 21:00.280]  Podcasting seems to be pandemic proof you asked if there's anything
[21:01.200 --> 21:07.360]  Pandemic proof and the cannabis industry. The only thing I can think of that has been pandemic proof is podcasting
[21:07.360 --> 21:12.320]  I have not missed a single episode. I have stepped up the quality of my show. I've stepped up the
[21:12.840 --> 21:15.840]  Everything the gear the technology the show is way better
[21:15.840 --> 21:19.600]  I've been trying to put more time energy and effort into the show since we can't go anywhere
[21:19.880 --> 21:21.080]  I'm gonna be here
[21:21.080 --> 21:23.680]  So I think the podcast has basically been
[21:24.000 --> 21:29.280]  Pandemic proof as long as I don't get sick as long as I don't get the kovat the show must go on
[21:29.280 --> 21:34.520]  I'll still come record with kovat because I can cough right into the damn microphone in the camera and you guys will be safe
[21:35.200 --> 21:37.800]  Knock on wood a lot to make sure I don't get the vid
[21:37.800 --> 21:43.240]  But I've also been protecting myself making sure I don't but I think that the pandemic
[21:43.240 --> 21:49.600]  The only thing is pandy proof here is podcasting and I don't want to jinx myself. So let's move forward from that
[21:49.760 --> 21:55.840]  Let's see question number four explain how you personally develop a sense and taste profile for your strains
[21:55.840 --> 22:02.600]  I says for example, my strain smells like wet diapers dirty feet stored next to mothballs and an old gasoline canister, bro
[22:02.600 --> 22:07.840]  That sounds like something I would say you've been listening to the show. So how do I explain my flavors and aromas?
[22:09.080 --> 22:11.920]  Basically, I have got a very strong
[22:13.720 --> 22:20.360]  Aroma memory bank I guess is the way to put that and I associate aromas and flavors and foods
[22:20.680 --> 22:28.280]  with places and times and locations and people I think that our aroma our sense of smell is
[22:28.840 --> 22:35.260]  Very very strong and it has a very long memory. I don't forget smells and aromas I can forget names
[22:35.260 --> 22:38.100]  I can forget faces. I can forget directions to places
[22:38.100 --> 22:43.000]  I can forget what I'm saying in the middle of a sentence, but if I smell something like oh, that's
[22:43.480 --> 22:48.920]  That's that perfume that grandma used to wear called this from this year and she wore it at that one event
[22:48.920 --> 22:52.600]  I'll never forget the smell grandma and that event just because of aromas
[22:52.600 --> 22:55.900]  I know that was a really weird example to pick but just right try to pick something random
[22:56.140 --> 23:02.260]  Smells will trigger memories for me and they don't go away and they're really vivid in my nose and I almost
[23:02.700 --> 23:07.260]  Sounds I may sound like I need mental help. Maybe I do I almost smell in colors
[23:07.340 --> 23:10.740]  That's why the red pill and blue pill got called red pill and blue pill
[23:10.740 --> 23:13.860]  That's why a lot of my strain names have colors in the names
[23:14.180 --> 23:20.580]  That's why there are related to fruits that have a color that you'll recognize. I smell in color as weird as that may sound
[23:21.460 --> 23:25.620]  It sounds weird as I say it, but I smell in color. I smell visually
[23:25.900 --> 23:31.620]  If I smell like this weird dank musty smell I can see the the basement where I used to learn the drums
[23:31.740 --> 23:33.300]  Like weird shit like that
[23:33.300 --> 23:38.140]  I can just I can my so what I'm doing when I'm telling you that this smells or this
[23:38.500 --> 23:43.940]  This product tastes or smells like dirty feet stored next to mothballs and an old gasoline container
[23:44.120 --> 23:50.220]  What I'm basically doing is I'm smoking it and I'm going huh? There's this flavor. What is that? Oh, that's mothballs
[23:50.660 --> 23:52.660]  Okay mothballs then I exhale
[23:53.060 --> 23:59.700]  What is that oh it left gas and like dryness on my tongue so it tastes like mothballs and chalky gas
[24:00.420 --> 24:05.540]  That's just what my brain associated those flavors with and also I'm trying to find
[24:06.100 --> 24:13.140]  Familiar words for you things that you have eaten smelled smoked drank tasted that I can relate that flavor to you
[24:13.140 --> 24:15.580]  So that when you smoke it you can go holy shit
[24:15.580 --> 24:17.580]  That does taste like oranges and dirty feet
[24:17.820 --> 24:22.780]  Something that you're familiar with something that my brain is familiar with and just try to articulate that from
[24:23.580 --> 24:25.780]  Just from my mental memory
[24:25.780 --> 24:31.180]  I've got a roll of decks of flavors and aromas in my nose that I will never forget and when I smell them I can
[24:31.180 --> 24:35.420]  Recall them quite quickly. You could probably blindfold me and take me to a few places
[24:35.420 --> 24:39.700]  I've been quite often and just let me go in there and smell it and I could probably tell you where I am
[24:39.860 --> 24:44.460]  There are a couple of commercial grows in Colorado that when I walk into them
[24:44.460 --> 24:47.980]  I can smell that grow very specifically
[24:47.980 --> 24:49.260]  I know that sounds crazy
[24:49.260 --> 24:54.020]  But I know the smell of I'm not even gonna say the names of the few of the cultivation facilities
[24:54.020 --> 24:58.980]  But they've all got a very distinct smell and if I walked in you blindfolded me I could say oh
[24:58.980 --> 25:03.440]  We're over here at this place and I can say oh we're over here at this place by the smell of the facility
[25:03.540 --> 25:05.660]  Maybe it's crazy. Maybe it's bionic
[25:06.500 --> 25:12.940]  Whatever it is. I think it's a blessing as a seed breeder to be able to identify flavors and aromas in that manner
[25:13.100 --> 25:18.780]  All right, I'm gonna keep moving forward. There are two more questions. I'm gonna fit them both in it says number five
[25:18.780 --> 25:23.260]  Is there anything to harvesting by the full moon lunar cycle or is this faux grow science?
[25:23.380 --> 25:30.980]  There are two major solar events in 2021. Have you observed these types of celestial events having any beneficial effects on a harvest?
[25:31.780 --> 25:34.860]  My first response to this was no because I'm not a hippie
[25:34.940 --> 25:40.180]  But honestly, I grow indoors on an indoor commercial production cultivation schedule
[25:40.180 --> 25:45.460]  and I don't even know if it's sunshine or rainy or snowy or daylight or
[25:45.780 --> 25:52.220]  Nighttime or an eclipse or a riot or a fire outside when I'm working in the cultivation facility
[25:52.220 --> 25:56.820]  It is the lights come on at this time. The lights go off at this time. The plants are on this schedule
[25:56.820 --> 26:04.140]  I don't know what's going on with the Sun and the moon and the hippie lunar calendar. I don't have any clue what's happening
[26:04.140 --> 26:07.360]  I don't pay any attention to that if I had an outdoor grow
[26:07.360 --> 26:11.200]  I would probably adjust and learn that hippie science stuff
[26:11.200 --> 26:14.480]  I would do all of that if I had an outdoor girl, but being an indoor farmer
[26:14.480 --> 26:17.920]  I do not pay any any attention to any of that stuff
[26:18.440 --> 26:21.720]  If you've got hate mail for that or any questions or updates for that
[26:21.720 --> 26:26.520]  My email address is grow from your heart at hotmail.com. I'd love to hear from anybody who's got input on that
[26:26.840 --> 26:33.780]  Honestly being an indoor cultivator running on a commercial cultivation schedule the Sun the moon lunar cycles
[26:33.900 --> 26:39.380]  Eclipses that doesn't make any difference in my grow. I like to go watch the eclipses myself. I'll check them out
[26:39.900 --> 26:43.260]  But the grow I don't think the grow cares at all
[26:44.380 --> 26:49.800]  Alright the last part number six and lastly you mentioned someone's name. I'm not gonna say their name
[26:50.020 --> 26:54.780]  Somebody dropped off some presents early for my divas. I'm using two of these items already
[26:54.780 --> 27:01.580]  I've got a handheld infrared thermometer and a desktop monthly planner that monthly planner will be invaluable
[27:01.580 --> 27:03.580]  It's one of the best things you can have
[27:03.780 --> 27:05.180]  Then it says
[27:05.180 --> 27:11.220]  My question is about the infrared thermometer. This thermometer has a laser used for pinpoint accuracy
[27:11.220 --> 27:18.100]  However, I'm wondering if said laser can damage the leaves even if the grow lights are on after all
[27:18.100 --> 27:22.380]  We're not supposed to look into that same laser. Do you implement an infrared thermometer?
[27:22.380 --> 27:25.820]  If so, where on the plant do you take your readings?
[27:25.820 --> 27:32.540]  I do not think that the infrared dot on that thermometer is going to disrupt your plants in any way
[27:33.060 --> 27:37.100]  As long as you don't hit it in the plants I and I don't know where the plants eyes are
[27:37.100 --> 27:40.460]  I don't think they have rods and cones to worry about. I think they've got
[27:41.420 --> 27:45.260]  We're not even gonna go into that what the whole that shit's called. I was gonna go down a long rabbit hole
[27:45.260 --> 27:47.260]  We're gonna skip that they've got leaves
[27:47.660 --> 27:53.500]  You can put that red dot on the leaves and I think it will tell you the leaf surface temperature of those leaves without doing
[27:53.500 --> 27:58.700]  Any damage? Where do I take those readings? I don't play with the infrared thermometer quite often
[27:58.700 --> 28:00.700]  I don't find it to be completely necessary
[28:01.180 --> 28:06.660]  But I would hit about the top of the canopy where the lights are shining and then about a third of the way down and
[28:06.660 --> 28:09.020]  Then toward the bottom just to have a nice comparison
[28:09.020 --> 28:12.540]  What's happening at different points of the room and you will notice that the leaf?
[28:12.900 --> 28:18.660]  Surface temperature will be vastly different than the air temperature of the room, especially when using LEDs
[28:18.660 --> 28:23.540]  I'm not gonna go too far into that because I do have somebody that I want to get on the show to teach us about
[28:23.540 --> 28:28.780]  That a little bit but when you're using LEDs the leaf surface temperature will be drastically different when you're using
[28:29.300 --> 28:31.700]  Metal halide or HPS lights
[28:31.780 --> 28:33.420]  So that is something to think about
[28:33.420 --> 28:37.680]  But I check in about three different spots up at the top where the lights really intense
[28:37.780 --> 28:42.460]  Down in the middle where the lights not so intense and then down lower where we're not getting much light
[28:42.660 --> 28:44.900]  Right right at the top of where we defoliated
[28:44.900 --> 28:49.060]  that's where I would check also and see make a note of it right down with the
[28:49.460 --> 28:53.380]  Temperature is on your leaf surface temperature and see if things go wrong or if things go, right?
[28:53.380 --> 28:57.700]  See if that leaf surface temperature had anything to do with it. All right, mister
[28:57.700 --> 29:02.540]  This was a long and great email. We took up the whole episode with this one. Thank you for the great contribution

[29:24.700 --> 29:29.220]  December everybody I'm already writing down my questions for my January letter
[29:29.260 --> 29:31.660]  We're gonna have to break that one up into a couple of episodes
[29:31.900 --> 29:35.820]  It says lastly a hand salute to all of my fellow veteran growers
[29:35.820 --> 29:38.020]  Yes big shout out to all of the veteran growers out there
[29:38.020 --> 29:43.020]  Then it says regardless if you're a novice a noob or if you're a novice or a noob
[29:43.020 --> 29:48.400]  You are still a veteran growers a big shout out. It sounds like mrs. Sent it a lot of love in this message
[29:48.880 --> 29:55.680]  Then it says peace love and a truly happy new year to all my growers love hugs and respect from
