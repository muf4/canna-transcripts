[00:00.890 --> 00:04.690]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:04.690 --> 00:07.690]  It's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:07.690 --> 00:11.290]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:11.290 --> 00:13.990]  That's right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:13.990 --> 00:16.290]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:16.290 --> 00:20.890]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who is just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:20.890 --> 00:23.690]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:23.690 --> 00:28.490]  I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:28.490 --> 00:32.490]  This episode of the podcast is brought to you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:32.490 --> 00:36.890]  If you need new genetics for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:36.890 --> 00:42.690]  You can find them at dankseed.store. Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat joint,
[00:42.690 --> 00:45.290]  pack up the bong, or start heating up that dab rig
[00:45.290 --> 00:50.290]  because it's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:56.290 --> 01:01.190]  Welcome back, podcast world. It's time for episode 324 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:01.190 --> 01:06.590]  This episode was recorded at Giddy Up's office, also known as the Emotech headquarters.
[01:06.590 --> 01:11.690]  This was a really fun episode to record. In this episode, I'm joined by Dabbing Granny.
[01:11.690 --> 01:13.890]  I've got Max from TNT Concentrates,
[01:13.890 --> 01:17.890]  and of course, we've got Giddy Up from Emotech, and of course, Giddy Up Concentrates,
[01:17.890 --> 01:20.690]  and a whole bunch of other things that he'll talk about on here.
[01:20.690 --> 01:23.690]  Also in the room were a few people that did not get on the mic,
[01:23.690 --> 01:26.090]  but they were hanging out. Shout out to all of them.
[01:26.090 --> 01:28.090]  They may get mentioned. If you don't catch who they are,
[01:28.090 --> 01:30.590]  it's because they didn't really want to be mic'd up.
[01:30.590 --> 01:34.390]  Some of them do speak up throughout the show. Maybe you'll catch who they are,
[01:34.390 --> 01:38.490]  but I think they'll be just fine if they remain anonymous.
[01:38.490 --> 01:41.590]  You guys, with all the people in the room, this podcast gets a little chatty,
[01:41.590 --> 01:43.590]  so I'm going to keep the intro short.
[01:43.590 --> 01:46.090]  Make sure you support my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[01:46.090 --> 01:48.990]  You can find them at dankseed.store.
[01:48.990 --> 01:56.790]  Ladies and gentlemen, let's time travel back to Denver with Dabbing Granny, Max from TNT, and Giddy Up.
[01:56.790 --> 01:59.390]  All right, podcast world, we are here. You guys can continue to talk.
[01:59.390 --> 02:01.890]  Go for it. The background chatter is great. I like the vibe.
[02:01.890 --> 02:09.190]  We're here at Emotech in Denver with a table full of amazing concentrates and a group of amazing folks.
[02:09.190 --> 02:12.590]  I'm going to start off to my left, a repeat offender joining me on the podcast,
[02:12.590 --> 02:15.690]  the always beautiful Dabbing Granny is here. Welcome back to the show, honey.
[02:15.690 --> 02:20.390]  Yes, it's me. It is the one and only Dabbing Granny, the real Dabbing Granny, the one that likes to bullshit.
[02:20.390 --> 02:22.390]  We'll have you here all night bullshitting if you'll let us.
[02:22.390 --> 02:24.690]  I would love to stay here all night bullshitting.
[02:24.690 --> 02:27.690]  Thanks for joining us. Thanks for putting this together.
[02:27.690 --> 02:31.390]  Oh, my pleasure. My pleasure indeed. Yes, it was my fault. Look at it.
[02:31.390 --> 02:36.290]  It's all my boy toys here tonight. Granny's hair, I'm up at Emotech.
[02:36.290 --> 02:40.790]  Also on a mic since he's talking over there. Giddy Up is in the house. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.
[02:40.790 --> 02:44.690]  What's up guys? Good to be back in Denver. Good to be back home.
[02:44.690 --> 02:48.190]  Literally back in Denver. You've been in Denver for like an hour now, I think.
[02:48.190 --> 02:52.590]  I travel a lot these days. You can never really tell where I'm going to be.
[02:52.590 --> 02:55.890]  I'm a guy that showed up with no shoes and a tank top and walked in with a half a sunburn.
[02:55.890 --> 02:58.390]  I was like, what's up motherfuckers? I brought Terps.
[02:58.390 --> 03:02.090]  I come from the Midwest. No man's land.
[03:02.090 --> 03:05.890]  My kind of friend right there. Hey, dude, thanks for letting us do this in your amazing facility.
[03:05.890 --> 03:08.390]  This place is fucking cool. Oh, I appreciate it, man. My pleasure.
[03:08.390 --> 03:12.890]  My pleasure. That's why we keep it nice. We like to have the community and the culture come in.
[03:12.890 --> 03:16.790]  And being all cold and scientific is just too much like hospital work, man.
[03:16.790 --> 03:20.090]  We like to have some character around here. I like the decorations on the wall.
[03:20.090 --> 03:24.090]  Who painted over there? Oh man, that's our boy right there. That's Brooks.
[03:24.090 --> 03:26.390]  I knew that was who it was. I didn't want to embarrass myself and be wrong.
[03:26.390 --> 03:28.490]  Shout out to Aaron Brooks with the great decorations on the wall.
[03:28.490 --> 03:33.690]  We got a monster-y and Aaron Brooks looking monster grabbing a bumblebee, squeezing some honey out.
[03:33.690 --> 03:36.590]  And this one over here. This one over here.
[03:36.590 --> 03:42.390]  So this was all done by Royal Stain, who is a graphic designer for Grassroots.
[03:42.390 --> 03:45.190]  OK, I recognize that art now that you say that.
[03:45.190 --> 03:55.890]  He did the bender right here. The Daily Planet from Futurama up there was done by Scenario.
[03:55.890 --> 04:00.190]  Scenario was a Tech Nines production manager for like nine years, did a lot of art with him.
[04:00.190 --> 04:04.290]  And was the guy that ran the lights at all the Tech Nines concerts.
[04:04.290 --> 04:08.490]  Super cool artist, but more of an electronic artist that is also a tagger.
[04:08.490 --> 04:10.490]  Sweet character in these walls. Yeah, yeah.
[04:10.590 --> 04:14.790]  And he did my glow in the dark logo right up here in our galaxy.
[04:14.790 --> 04:17.190]  And my mom added the disco balls.
[04:17.190 --> 04:21.690]  The disco balls set it off. Shout out to mom for the disco balls. Those make it all happen.
[04:21.690 --> 04:26.990]  Great facility. If you guys ever get the chance to drop into Emotech in Denver, you'll know how to find it if you need to be here.
[04:26.990 --> 04:31.590]  Over there on the other mic, hitting a blunt right now, staring off into space.
[04:31.590 --> 04:34.390]  Literally. Literally.
[04:34.390 --> 04:39.690]  Did you just find that, bro? Did you just find that the space is there? Use your microphone voice.
[04:39.690 --> 04:42.390]  Yes, I did.
[04:42.390 --> 04:44.290]  Max is on the show, kind of. Welcome to the show, Max.
[04:44.290 --> 04:47.190]  Is that what we call you by your stripper name? You can call me my stripper name.
[04:47.190 --> 04:50.990]  Okay. Yeah, yeah. TNT. He said he don't care as long as you're shoving money in his riches.
[04:50.990 --> 04:57.490]  I put so many dollars in his thong earlier. Call him whatever you want. I can call him whatever I want. I own him for the night.
[04:57.490 --> 05:01.390]  Thanks for joining us on the show, bro. Check out my premium snap. Check out his premium snap.
[05:01.390 --> 05:05.490]  Check out his Patreon. Throw some dollars in his thong. This guy weird.
[05:05.590 --> 05:09.890]  I'm classy. I'm classy. I got that Twitch account where I show dick at.
[05:09.890 --> 05:12.290]  He's super classy. He's got one red toenail.
[05:12.290 --> 05:14.290]  It sounds like Twitch is a place to show dick, though.
[05:14.290 --> 05:19.690]  See, and that's why. It's all about how you brand showing your genitals to random people on the internet.
[05:19.690 --> 05:21.690]  That's all it is. Just like weed.
[05:21.690 --> 05:24.990]  I want to give a shout out to my friend Giddy. One night a long time ago, I was on Chatterbait.
[05:24.990 --> 05:28.890]  No, it wasn't Chatterbait. It was Chatroulette. Chatterbait's a whole different story.
[05:28.890 --> 05:32.690]  I was on Chatroulette, and Giddy pops up on Chatroulette.
[05:32.690 --> 05:37.190]  Yeah, dude. Back in the day, I was growing and extracting out of the house.
[05:37.190 --> 05:43.190]  I had no motherfucking friends, because I was a double liability for breaking the law.
[05:43.190 --> 05:46.590]  I had a GroGo, and I had an extraction lab in my house.
[05:46.590 --> 05:48.090]  In Oklahoma?
[05:48.090 --> 05:53.890]  No, here. In Colorado Springs, man. I was so lonely. I needed human contact.
[05:53.890 --> 05:57.390]  I couldn't have friends come over and hang out, so I'd hop on the internet.
[05:57.390 --> 05:59.190]  I'd do Tiny Chat. Tiny Chat was fun.
[05:59.190 --> 06:04.190]  I'd smoke with people. It was so fun to get out there. I know you're laughing.
[06:04.190 --> 06:11.690]  You know you've got a friend with character if you ever see him on Chatroulette and you don't see him dick first.
[06:11.690 --> 06:12.890]  I've never seen Giddy's dick.
[06:12.890 --> 06:15.690]  That's right. I was fully clothed. I was smoking weed with people on the internet.
[06:15.690 --> 06:18.390]  We both popped up, dicks in our pants.
[06:18.390 --> 06:19.190]  Dicks in our pants.
[06:19.190 --> 06:22.590]  This was before the days of the Instagram live, before the Facebook live.
[06:22.590 --> 06:27.190]  This is when you'd log in and just be on one thing, and you had to find other weirdos to hang out with.
[06:27.190 --> 06:31.190]  You'd just randomly find people and you'd go, next, fuck this weird guy. He's got his dick out.
[06:31.190 --> 06:33.190]  Some girl doing some...
[06:33.190 --> 06:34.190]  South Park said it best.
[06:34.190 --> 06:36.690]  Okay, we're going to talk about... and that's a dick.
[06:36.690 --> 06:39.190]  Alright, we'll just click... alright, that's a dick.
[06:39.190 --> 06:41.690]  That's another dick.
[06:41.690 --> 06:43.690]  Some Asian dude.
[06:43.690 --> 06:46.190]  Alright, another dick.
[06:46.190 --> 06:47.190]  That was Chatroulette.
[06:47.190 --> 06:48.690]  Hey, what's up? You want to smoke?
[06:48.690 --> 06:50.190]  Yeah. And we smoked.
[06:50.190 --> 06:54.190]  And then we got stoned and rambled on and probably looked at dicks after that.
[06:54.190 --> 06:58.190]  Actually, once I hit somebody... that was my deal on Chatroulette.
[06:58.190 --> 07:05.690]  On top of that, I speak a little Italian and I speak a little Spanish, so that you can locate by region, too.
[07:05.690 --> 07:12.190]  And I would go on places and I would try to have conversations with people in there and flex on my shit, right?
[07:12.190 --> 07:15.190]  He's got me giggling over here.
[07:15.190 --> 07:18.190]  You just giggle all you want, sweetheart.
[07:18.190 --> 07:20.190]  Granny's blushing. I've never seen Granny turn cuck before.
[07:20.190 --> 07:24.190]  Kitty, Mr. Trilingual. Amore.
[07:24.190 --> 07:26.190]  You want me to sing to you in Italian?
[07:26.190 --> 07:28.190]  Yeah, I do. We've got time for that.
[07:28.190 --> 07:31.190]  We'll hit it at the end. We'll exit out the show with a nice little song.
[07:31.190 --> 07:34.190]  Everybody needs to stay tuned.
[07:34.190 --> 07:36.190]  Make sure to listen to the whole podcast.
[07:36.190 --> 07:39.190]  Don't forget. Don't let us forget that we are owed some music.
[07:39.190 --> 07:44.190]  Hey, I'm not responsible for anything your wife does after I sing in Italian.
[07:44.190 --> 07:49.190]  Silently in the corner there is Kevin, also known as Grumpy Grandpa. He's hanging out in the corner.
[07:49.190 --> 07:52.190]  Moderating us. Keeping us all in line.
[07:52.190 --> 07:54.190]  Not responsible for anything.
[07:54.190 --> 07:56.190]  Not responsible and did the arm wave.
[07:56.190 --> 07:58.190]  So we've got a couple of things we could touch on here.
[07:58.190 --> 08:04.190]  A few days ago, Giddy teased about you can't believe what's happening in Denver.
[08:04.190 --> 08:07.190]  I think it's my responsibility to pry that information out of you, my friend.
[08:07.190 --> 08:09.190]  What the hell's happening in Denver?
[08:09.190 --> 08:12.190]  I think the secret's kind of out of the bag now.
[08:12.190 --> 08:16.190]  The reason why I didn't want to touch on it and talk about it too much in my post,
[08:16.190 --> 08:19.190]  because I was waiting on more information to come in.
[08:19.190 --> 08:22.190]  About one of the...
[08:22.190 --> 08:24.190]  Excuse me.
[08:24.190 --> 08:28.190]  I hit me a little diamond deposit in that blunt.
[08:28.190 --> 08:31.190]  I think you found it.
[08:31.190 --> 08:34.190]  I found it.
[08:34.190 --> 08:36.190]  One of the...
[08:36.190 --> 08:38.190]  I won't name names.
[08:38.190 --> 08:43.190]  One of the larger facilities in the state, in Denver, had contacted me.
[08:44.190 --> 08:48.190]  They went over their SOPs with Diamond Production, with the fire department.
[08:48.190 --> 08:50.190]  The fire department, those guys are great.
[08:50.190 --> 08:52.190]  First of all, big shout out to Denver Fire Department.
[08:52.190 --> 08:59.190]  Those guys have always been really cool to work with, considering what we did.
[08:59.190 --> 09:02.190]  They worked with us when it was sketchy as shit.
[09:02.190 --> 09:06.190]  Because of them, now companies like mine and other companies can flourish in multiple states.
[09:09.190 --> 09:11.190]  Much love to Denver Fire Department.
[09:11.190 --> 09:13.190]  They were here with us when a lot of people weren't.
[09:13.190 --> 09:17.190]  Did they get involved because of something stupid?
[09:17.190 --> 09:23.190]  They got involved because somebody had a jar pop in an ignition on a high saturation in a lab.
[09:23.190 --> 09:26.190]  Now wait, break that down to normal people talk.
[09:26.190 --> 09:30.190]  Most of the people listening are not extractors.
[09:30.190 --> 09:32.190]  I'm sorry, I'm talking to the room. I forgot I'm holding a mic.
[09:32.190 --> 09:35.190]  You can tell all of us here and we will understand that.
[09:36.190 --> 09:42.190]  From what I understand, the way a lot of people make jars of diamonds is jar tech.
[09:42.190 --> 09:48.190]  You put a high saturation of butane in the jar, set a temperature, put it in, and diamonds drop out.
[09:48.190 --> 09:50.190]  You'll have to separate.
[09:50.190 --> 09:55.190]  It takes a lot of, you're going to have a lot more butane than you ever want to put in an electronic oven.
[09:55.190 --> 09:58.190]  It was one of those things that we knew was going to be short lived.
[09:58.190 --> 10:01.190]  We knew that wasn't when they got it.
[10:01.190 --> 10:02.190]  That tech.
[10:02.190 --> 10:03.190]  That tech, exactly.
[10:03.190 --> 10:04.190]  That technique for doing it.
[10:04.190 --> 10:08.190]  The way that most people entry level start doing it.
[10:10.190 --> 10:12.190]  They're definitely not going to be allowing that.
[10:12.190 --> 10:19.190]  They're not going to be allowing pour-offs that reach a certain limit on the, if you're, so basically let's say Denver comes in,
[10:19.190 --> 10:23.190]  show me your SOP, explain, we're going to go over how you do your diamonds.
[10:23.190 --> 10:30.190]  So when you pop your lid off of your extraction device to pour into, be it pressure vessel, jar, anything that you have.
[10:30.190 --> 10:32.190]  Did they say anything about pressure vessels?
[10:32.190 --> 10:34.190]  They are not liking pressure.
[10:34.190 --> 10:37.190]  They will not have pressure vessels in ovens.
[10:37.190 --> 10:43.190]  They won't have pressure vessels that stand for a long time.
[10:43.190 --> 10:49.190]  So they're not liking what they're seeing right now from the pressure vessel market.
[10:49.190 --> 10:53.190]  They are definitely, absolutely not liking jar tech.
[10:53.190 --> 10:56.190]  That doesn't mean there's not a way to skin the cat.
[10:56.190 --> 10:58.190]  Dude, yeah, there's a million ways to skin the cat.
[10:58.190 --> 11:05.190]  I'm telling the man who's like one of the best diamond producers that I even know of is sitting across from me right now.
[11:05.190 --> 11:07.190]  I'm going to dab his five gram diamond later.
[11:11.190 --> 11:15.190]  As you know, there's no way, but what it's going to do is going to clean out the riff raff in the legal market.
[11:15.190 --> 11:21.190]  And it's going to shake things up and it's going to prove for mainly like what I look,
[11:21.190 --> 11:24.190]  is the people that I mess with is the guys in the lab.
[11:24.190 --> 11:25.190]  It's another hurdle.
[11:25.190 --> 11:27.190]  If you can't adapt and go, then.
[11:28.190 --> 11:32.190]  Will all this drive the prices of the concentrates up?
[11:32.190 --> 11:34.190]  It depends on what the stock is of the market.
[11:34.190 --> 11:39.190]  For some places that people shop, if you shop at one or two places, it could happen.
[11:39.190 --> 11:44.190]  It will, I mean, if they come into your place and you buy, if you're the type of customer that buys the white label at the dispensary,
[11:44.190 --> 11:48.190]  and that dispensary, that vertically integrated dispensary wasn't ready for it,
[11:48.190 --> 11:52.190]  they may increase the price of what they got because they're going to have to re-go.
[11:53.190 --> 11:58.190]  A lot of these people have a large stock of diamonds and it's not a problem that's going to,
[11:58.190 --> 12:03.190]  that's going to take them off their feet long enough to affect that large supply of stock.
[12:03.190 --> 12:09.190]  Do you foresee this happening statewide instead of just citywide?
[12:09.190 --> 12:10.190]  I see this happening everywhere.
[12:10.190 --> 12:11.190]  Well, I know you're going to say nationwide.
[12:11.190 --> 12:12.190]  Everywhere.
[12:12.190 --> 12:13.190]  But we're going to talk, is it.
[12:13.190 --> 12:16.190]  Colorado kind of sets the standard for the rest of the country.
[12:16.190 --> 12:18.190]  What Denver, what Denver do, they all do.
[12:19.190 --> 12:26.190]  Can we compare this to how people used to open blast their Shatter and have all these explosions and stuff back then?
[12:26.190 --> 12:28.190]  I will say that there are definitely some comparisons.
[12:28.190 --> 12:35.190]  While I do believe that the same dangers exist in both, one is significantly less, case in point.
[12:35.190 --> 12:39.190]  I mean, nobody talks about, you know, jars popping.
[12:39.190 --> 12:44.190]  I mean, we put thousands, you put thousands of jars out and, you know, into the process.
[12:44.190 --> 12:47.190]  And if you do it the right way, it doesn't happen.
[12:47.190 --> 12:55.190]  Well, TNT and I had this discussion, and he said, well, the state can come in, but that doesn't fix stupid.
[12:55.190 --> 13:03.190]  Well, you know, it's funny because right here in this building that we're sitting in, Mark Rudolph of the Denver Fire Department,
[13:03.190 --> 13:08.190]  very classy fellow, smart guy, and knows exactly what we all do.
[13:08.190 --> 13:11.190]  He's actually trained and certified on multiple hydrocarbons.
[13:11.190 --> 13:15.190]  I've trained him on my equipment, and he's a good guy.
[13:15.190 --> 13:22.190]  He came in here one day after there was an accident with an Emotech machine in a lab, and they brought me the video.
[13:22.190 --> 13:25.190]  You know, what happened here? Why was it a failure?
[13:25.190 --> 13:33.190]  You know, we went and did an incident report on it and filled out, like, from what we could see was all of the things that led to the accident,
[13:33.190 --> 13:38.190]  which in that case was a gross negligence of the owner.
[13:38.190 --> 13:45.190]  The extractor quit, and they sent a female bartender that had never been in the extraction lab out to finish someone's run.
[13:45.190 --> 13:48.190]  And she did not know what she was doing?
[13:48.190 --> 13:52.190]  Oh, no, she wasn't certified to run the machine. She didn't work in the lab.
[13:52.190 --> 14:02.190]  She had no idea. She was trying to be safe and made some mistakes that caused the vessel's lid to come off and all the butane leaks.
[14:02.190 --> 14:11.190]  She didn't shut off the valves. She didn't exercise any of the stuff that you're trained to do, like in the case of a catastrophic failure for any machine.
[14:11.190 --> 14:13.190]  And that's one of the parts of the peer review.
[14:13.190 --> 14:19.190]  When we talk about you buying peer-reviewed machines, we talk about ASME certifications.
[14:19.190 --> 14:23.190]  What has happened here is a group of engineers have taken...
[14:23.190 --> 14:28.190]  Whoa, it's storming. We just lost power for a second, but we're good on here.
[14:28.190 --> 14:29.190]  Podcast kept going.
[14:29.190 --> 14:30.190]  Podcast don't care.
[14:31.190 --> 14:35.190]  But did y'all see the glowing horse head when the lights went out that time?
[14:35.190 --> 14:48.190]  Nobody has gone over that particular machine or designed a machine to see if there is a functionality, a function, I'm sorry, a function of the machine that would cause a catastrophic failure.
[14:49.190 --> 14:54.190]  Part of that peer review being done is you have to have your instruction manual.
[14:54.190 --> 15:04.190]  You have to have a clear set way of training, and you have to have a certification program for the people that actually run it and put it up on the wall.
[15:04.190 --> 15:12.190]  So with none of that ever being in place, that was the first steps into a multi-step problem that comes around.
[15:13.190 --> 15:18.190]  And Mark Rudolph said, Giddy, you make these things idiot-proof, and they just keep making better idiots.
[15:18.190 --> 15:21.190]  Oh, no, come on.
[15:21.190 --> 15:23.190]  That was good.
[15:23.190 --> 15:25.190]  That wasn't supposed to be a joke.
[15:25.190 --> 15:27.190]  That wasn't supposed to be a joke.
[15:27.190 --> 15:29.190]  I was just saying I've been talking for 90 seconds.
[15:29.190 --> 15:31.190]  I was going to let you keep going.
[15:31.190 --> 15:33.190]  So somebody else can hop in so it doesn't get heavy on my side.
[15:33.190 --> 15:38.190]  With all that said and done, where do you foresee what we're smoking?
[15:38.190 --> 15:39.190]  Where is it going to go to?
[15:40.190 --> 15:43.190]  They're just going to have to figure out different techs.
[15:43.190 --> 15:48.190]  I mean there's a million ways to skin the cat, so they're just going to have to go around using pressure vessels.
[15:48.190 --> 15:56.190]  I think the thing is, they won't just say, yes, pressure vessels.
[15:56.190 --> 16:04.190]  What it will take will be a company like mine getting the peer review and process peer review done to get a pressure vessel certified.
[16:04.190 --> 16:08.190]  Yeah, but pressure vessels are like the low-hanging fruit, though.
[16:08.190 --> 16:11.190]  A precipitation of THC.
[16:11.190 --> 16:17.190]  I mean there's a million other ways to do it, but that's definitely the most idiot-proof.
[16:17.190 --> 16:23.190]  And quick, fast, repetitive, and you can hire someone and train them how to do it in a day,
[16:23.190 --> 16:28.190]  and it doesn't take a real grasp of science to do it that way.
[16:28.190 --> 16:30.190]  That's kind of monkey see, monkey do.
[16:30.190 --> 16:32.190]  For sure.
[16:32.190 --> 16:37.190]  But that also in itself has inconsistency in the product.
[16:37.190 --> 16:41.190]  You can't get what he makes right there.
[16:41.190 --> 16:44.190]  Yeah, you guys can't see what we have on the table.
[16:44.190 --> 16:46.190]  There's some diamonds here.
[16:46.190 --> 16:54.190]  You can't get what he has as consistent as he has barge all in an oven with some three-month employees,
[16:54.190 --> 16:57.190]  because you fired everybody. That takes work.
[16:57.190 --> 17:00.190]  So we're not going to see too drastic of a change in the market?
[17:00.190 --> 17:08.190]  No, it's just going to be enough to shake up what I see as a bunch of complacent people in the market,
[17:08.190 --> 17:12.190]  happy with mediocrity that think they got it fucking going on.
[17:12.190 --> 17:16.190]  As long as it makes a better product for the patients, that's all that matters.
[17:16.190 --> 17:20.190]  As long as it makes a better product and it advances the industry,
[17:20.190 --> 17:23.190]  I mean that's what everything's meant to happen, you know what I mean?
[17:23.190 --> 17:24.190]  Totally.
[17:24.190 --> 17:27.190]  And we need safe facilities. We need to know that extractors aren't going to get blown up.
[17:27.190 --> 17:30.190]  There's nothing that anybody can argue about this being right or wrong.
[17:30.190 --> 17:36.190]  You can't come set a cross for me and look me in the eye and tell me that you're fucking Jartek safe.
[17:36.190 --> 17:38.190]  I know it's not.
[17:38.190 --> 17:43.190]  People have kept it real secretive. I'm not into the concentrate making, so I've kind of ignored the tech.
[17:43.190 --> 17:50.190]  But you guys spilled more of the tech on this episode than I've been able to get out of people that have been working on this for a long time.
[17:50.190 --> 17:53.190]  So I'm kind of new to Jartek. Yeah, that sounds dangerous as fuck.
[17:53.190 --> 17:56.190]  I'm surprised this is the first time something like that happened.
[17:56.190 --> 17:57.190]  Holy shit.
[17:57.190 --> 18:01.190]  Honestly, the first diamonds I made were Jartek.
[18:01.190 --> 18:04.190]  The early days we were doing pressure relief valves on jars.
[18:04.190 --> 18:07.190]  Like when we first started, that was kind of the tech.
[18:07.190 --> 18:12.190]  Finding 15 pound pressure release, pressure valves on jars.
[18:12.190 --> 18:14.190]  We went down to like the six pounds.
[18:14.190 --> 18:16.190]  I just worked my way.
[18:16.190 --> 18:19.190]  And it was just hit and miss, trial and error?
[18:19.190 --> 18:24.190]  Well, that was when we were still using the tail end of.
[18:24.190 --> 18:29.190]  But now we use argon or nitrogen to back pressurize.
[18:29.190 --> 18:38.190]  Which is way easier because you start off with a clean solution rather than starting your recrystallization in a dirty solution to begin with.
[18:38.190 --> 18:40.190]  People are trying to take notes.
[18:40.190 --> 18:46.190]  There are people that are listening to the show that are just scribbling down their backspace in what you just said, trying to figure that out.
[18:46.190 --> 18:50.190]  If you want to share any of that information, you can keep going if you'd like.
[18:50.190 --> 18:56.190]  If you'd like to learn how to do any of those steps a little more in depth or if you'd like to keep your tech to yourself, feel free to teach us all about the tech, man.
[18:56.190 --> 18:58.190]  Don't do it.
[18:58.190 --> 19:02.190]  You can look me up on TNT Extractions.
[19:02.190 --> 19:04.190]  That's the way to do it right there.
[19:04.190 --> 19:05.190]  Get yourself some follows.
[19:05.190 --> 19:09.190]  Follow him. He'll give you what you need for, I'm sure, if you really want to make a change.
[19:09.190 --> 19:14.190]  I would just say purchase your hash from somebody that knows what they're doing.
[19:15.190 --> 19:21.190]  And on top of that, man, your money is all your power, people in this weed industry.
[19:21.190 --> 19:22.190]  That's how you vote.
[19:22.190 --> 19:26.190]  Support, research the people that you're buying from.
[19:26.190 --> 19:27.190]  Look into this.
[19:27.190 --> 19:30.190]  You're making people a lot of money.
[19:30.190 --> 19:31.190]  You're giving your money to a place.
[19:31.190 --> 19:33.190]  You should feel good about it.
[19:33.190 --> 19:35.190]  Are all diamonds created equal?
[19:35.190 --> 19:37.190]  No.
[19:37.190 --> 19:38.190]  No?
[19:38.190 --> 19:39.190]  Starting material, too.
[19:39.190 --> 19:42.190]  You can make crystals out of shitty-ass crude.
[19:42.190 --> 19:46.190]  I'll drop you one. I'll drop you one of that new on that.
[19:46.190 --> 19:48.190]  Never mind.
[19:48.190 --> 19:49.190]  Now we want it real bad.
[19:49.190 --> 19:53.190]  I was going to talk about dropping diamonds out of crude.
[19:53.190 --> 19:54.190]  Yeah, people do it.
[19:54.190 --> 20:00.190]  People drop diamonds out of crude, and it's actually, if somebody puts you onto it, it's the simplest process in the world.
[20:00.190 --> 20:03.190]  It's no different than anything else we do.
[20:03.190 --> 20:04.190]  Are people doing that?
[20:04.190 --> 20:05.190]  Oh, yeah.
[20:05.190 --> 20:06.190]  Guaranteed.
[20:06.190 --> 20:07.190]  Yeah.
[20:07.190 --> 20:08.190]  And here's the thing.
[20:08.190 --> 20:09.190]  Here's the thing.
[20:09.190 --> 20:11.190]  There's nothing wrong with it.
[20:11.190 --> 20:12.190]  There isn't.
[20:12.190 --> 20:14.190]  As long as you take care of your footprint.
[20:14.190 --> 20:27.190]  As long as your process is right and your shit is thorough, that is the same THCA that you're getting out of whatever as you are getting out of the most fire-primed cured buds.
[20:27.190 --> 20:37.190]  And that's where the connoisseur attitude has to take a backseat to the designer cannabinoid makeups that we're doing nowadays.
[20:37.190 --> 20:38.190]  This has gone beyond.
[20:38.190 --> 20:43.190]  We have taken everything that you love and separated it, and now we can do designer mixes on it.
[20:43.190 --> 20:46.190]  I'm still a holistic smoking guy.
[20:46.190 --> 20:47.190]  I like my raw products.
[20:47.190 --> 20:49.190]  I like water hash.
[20:49.190 --> 20:51.190]  I don't like rosin.
[20:51.190 --> 20:55.190]  I like BHO, but I don't like it over-processed.
[20:55.190 --> 20:58.190]  Why is it you don't like rosin?
[20:58.190 --> 21:00.190]  I really want to know.
[21:00.190 --> 21:02.190]  I don't like the bad taste of rosin.
[21:02.190 --> 21:03.190]  And he can edit this out.
[21:03.190 --> 21:04.190]  I agree.
[21:04.190 --> 21:05.190]  No, I'm in on this topic.
[21:05.190 --> 21:06.190]  We got some here you need to taste.
[21:06.190 --> 21:07.190]  I don't like the odor.
[21:07.190 --> 21:08.190]  I don't like the odor.
[21:08.190 --> 21:09.190]  I don't like a lot of rosin.
[21:09.190 --> 21:10.190]  Don't get me wrong.
[21:10.190 --> 21:11.190]  I was the same way for a while.
[21:11.190 --> 21:12.190]  I just don't.
[21:12.190 --> 21:16.190]  I even heard you say the other day that you're considering making rosin.
[21:16.190 --> 21:19.190]  My drop to the floor.
[21:19.190 --> 21:23.190]  Do you know how many people had to go, oh my God, did I hear what he said?
[21:23.190 --> 21:25.190]  We're going to start doing it all, man.
[21:25.190 --> 21:27.190]  I mean, I love hash.
[21:27.190 --> 21:35.190]  If I don't get the fire rosin, like nicotine rosin that they dropped out of fields out there, man, it was so fire.
[21:35.190 --> 21:37.190]  And I come across fire rosin.
[21:37.190 --> 21:44.190]  I don't like rosin enough to take a chance to dab it to not like, I do not like the taste of bad rosin.
[21:44.190 --> 21:46.190]  I do not like the burnt taste of herbs.
[21:46.190 --> 21:47.190]  Neither do I.
[21:47.190 --> 21:49.190]  I don't like the stuff that turns my nail black.
[21:49.190 --> 21:50.190]  I don't like bad rosin for bad weed.
[21:50.190 --> 21:51.190]  I do not like bad weed.
[21:51.190 --> 21:55.190]  But I have been smoking some really good rosin.
[21:55.190 --> 21:58.190]  I've been smoking some really good rosin.
[21:58.190 --> 22:01.190]  Somebody's also got to check those vegan fucks, man.
[22:01.190 --> 22:05.190]  You rosin boys out here running around acting like shit don't sting.
[22:05.190 --> 22:08.190]  I see you in the streets.
[22:08.190 --> 22:10.190]  16 a zip.
[22:10.190 --> 22:11.190]  I played the fifth.
[22:11.190 --> 22:13.190]  They're not breaking laws?
[22:13.190 --> 22:15.190]  What?
[22:15.190 --> 22:17.190]  I'm glad you said that in a low voice on that, Mike.
[22:17.190 --> 22:18.190]  That is perfect.
[22:18.190 --> 22:19.190]  I'm not even going to edit that.
[22:19.190 --> 22:22.190]  A lot of the rosin I smoke tastes like a burnt Popsicle stick or something.
[22:22.190 --> 22:23.190]  And that's it, bro.
[22:23.190 --> 22:25.190]  I love everything done.
[22:25.190 --> 22:28.190]  If that shit will burn, I'll smoke it.
[22:29.190 --> 22:33.190]  Sometimes rosin is like how people used to look at BHO.
[22:33.190 --> 22:36.190]  It used to be just the trim and stuff like that.
[22:36.190 --> 22:39.190]  They would go to it like that's how some people look at rosin.
[22:39.190 --> 22:44.190]  A lot of people, all the melt and stuff like that that isn't full melt gets end up in rosin.
[22:44.190 --> 22:50.190]  I mean there are some people that are doing like squishing the 90 and the 120s,
[22:50.190 --> 22:53.190]  which makes amazing tasting rosin.
[22:53.190 --> 22:56.190]  But a lot of it's taking out the junk, I guess.
[22:57.190 --> 22:59.190]  Sorry, we just discovered a tech thing.
[22:59.190 --> 23:00.190]  It's being solved for me.
[23:00.190 --> 23:02.190]  I appreciate my friends are helping me out.
[23:02.190 --> 23:05.190]  It's plugged in right down there, but I don't know if I plug it into a desktop.
[23:05.190 --> 23:06.190]  You should probably dab some of this rosin.
[23:06.190 --> 23:08.190]  I'd love to dab some of your rosin.
[23:08.190 --> 23:10.190]  I talk a lot of shit on rosin too because it's funny.
[23:10.190 --> 23:14.190]  And because you guys get pissed when we do.
[23:14.190 --> 23:16.190]  That's the only reason I talk shit about rosin.
[23:16.190 --> 23:18.190]  It gets panties in a wad.
[23:18.190 --> 23:19.190]  It gets panties in a wad.
[23:19.190 --> 23:24.190]  And honestly, in this day and age, I really don't even like to think that I do that on this game.
[23:24.190 --> 23:27.190]  If you notice, I don't make many rosin jokes anymore that linger.
[23:27.190 --> 23:31.190]  I'll pop one out every now and then when creativity strikes.
[23:31.190 --> 23:38.190]  But I mean, that's another real topic is how hateful everybody is on the internet to people.
[23:38.190 --> 23:40.190]  I love a good rosin talk.
[23:40.190 --> 23:41.190]  I love what it does.
[23:41.190 --> 23:42.190]  I love what it does.
[23:42.190 --> 23:43.190]  It gets people moving.
[23:43.190 --> 23:51.190]  I just see something and I'm like, I could say something politically incorrect
[23:51.190 --> 23:56.190]  or I could just fucking call it rosin-ish and just tie rosin to it.
[23:56.190 --> 23:59.190]  What were you just handed?
[23:59.190 --> 24:03.190]  Besides heaven, how else would you describe that jar?
[24:03.190 --> 24:14.190]  I got a baller-ass jar here of some white, almost, I mean, yeah, white, like champagne colored.
[24:14.190 --> 24:16.190]  Alright, Podcast World.
[24:16.190 --> 24:20.190]  Unfortunately, at this point in the recording, that technical issue I was talking about caught up to us.
[24:20.190 --> 24:22.190]  I was forced to press pause on the recording.
[24:22.190 --> 24:24.190]  I had to restart the computer.
[24:24.190 --> 24:28.190]  While the computer restarted, we smoked down.
[24:28.190 --> 24:29.190]  We got lit up in that building.
[24:29.190 --> 24:32.190]  We smoked some dabs of THCA crystals.
[24:32.190 --> 24:33.190]  We smoked some rosin.
[24:33.190 --> 24:35.190]  We smoked a couple of blunts.
[24:35.190 --> 24:37.190]  We made that place cloudy.
[24:37.190 --> 24:41.190]  And then we all sat back down in our seats and we got back down on a podcast.
[24:41.190 --> 24:43.190]  And here is what I captured.
[24:43.190 --> 24:47.190]  So before technology went haywire on us, we had some lightning.
[24:47.190 --> 24:48.190]  We had some wind.
[24:48.190 --> 24:49.190]  We had some stuff.
[24:49.190 --> 24:50.190]  We had some power over us.
[24:50.190 --> 24:51.190]  What we've got.
[24:51.190 --> 24:53.190]  It kind of disrupted my recording equipment, but we are back on track.
[24:53.190 --> 24:55.190]  We took a nice, fat smoke break.
[24:55.190 --> 25:02.190]  During that break, I was given a dab of some rosin from my friend Max here at TNT off of this gorgeous little rig.
[25:02.190 --> 25:04.190]  What strain did you give me to dab, bro?
[25:04.190 --> 25:06.190]  That was some of the chem.
[25:06.190 --> 25:07.190]  The chem.
[25:07.190 --> 25:08.190]  Yeah.
[25:08.190 --> 25:09.190]  You're right, bro.
[25:09.190 --> 25:10.190]  Not all rosin is shit.
[25:10.190 --> 25:11.190]  I'll give you that.
[25:11.190 --> 25:12.190]  That was pretty good, bro.
[25:12.190 --> 25:13.190]  Thank you.
[25:13.190 --> 25:14.190]  No problem.
[25:14.190 --> 25:15.190]  It gave me a different kind of stone.
[25:15.190 --> 25:17.190]  BHO dabs, crystals, any type of BHO.
[25:17.190 --> 25:19.190]  I feel like it's missing this eye-high that I get.
[25:19.190 --> 25:20.190]  I agree.
[25:20.190 --> 25:21.190]  Yeah.
[25:21.190 --> 25:22.190]  That's not in there.
[25:22.190 --> 25:27.190]  Whatever does this to my – when you smoke – well, I did smoke blunts also, but I noticed it from that rosin dab.
[25:27.190 --> 25:30.190]  It went right to my eyes, right to the front of my face.
[25:30.190 --> 25:31.190]  And you don't get that from BHO.
[25:31.190 --> 25:33.190]  So that's kind of cool that I missed that.
[25:33.190 --> 25:37.190]  I don't think it's not that you don't get it from BHO.
[25:37.190 --> 25:43.190]  I think it's people get into the habit of smoking one type of product.
[25:44.190 --> 25:49.190]  If you smoke BHO and you go smoke rosin, it's going to affect you differently because it's going to work differently.
[25:49.190 --> 25:52.190]  You haven't had it for a while, and it's great.
[25:52.190 --> 25:57.190]  And when you bounce back and forth, it's almost like strain locking because I hit good rosin, bro, and you're right.
[25:57.190 --> 26:00.190]  It gets me a completely different high than my BHO gets me.
[26:00.190 --> 26:09.190]  But if I only smoke flower for a while and then I go smoke BHO, the BHO hits me right again to where I'm just stubbornly stupid.
[26:09.190 --> 26:11.190]  Rosin messes me up.
[26:11.190 --> 26:13.190]  It puts me to sleep like BHO used to.
[26:13.190 --> 26:15.190]  It just threw me back.
[26:15.190 --> 26:18.190]  I'm just like, whoa.
[26:18.190 --> 26:21.190]  Well, you've also been smoking these fine CBD products.
[26:21.190 --> 26:22.190]  Oh, yes.
[26:22.190 --> 26:24.190]  This CBD that came from the first.
[26:24.190 --> 26:28.190]  Let's talk about this Oklahoma CBD products from Calm Extracts.
[26:28.190 --> 26:29.190]  He's got a dab to take.
[26:29.190 --> 26:30.190]  I'm about to take a dab.
[26:30.190 --> 26:31.190]  Oh, he's got a dab.
[26:31.190 --> 26:32.190]  Oh, guys, giddy up.
[26:32.190 --> 26:34.190]  He's tasting rosin.
[26:34.190 --> 26:35.190]  It's the rosin I smoked.
[26:35.190 --> 26:38.190]  He's got several seconds.
[26:38.190 --> 26:39.190]  He's dabbing now.
[26:39.190 --> 26:42.190]  There's a big contemplation on how long he should wait.
[26:42.190 --> 26:43.190]  He is smoking the candy.
[26:43.190 --> 26:44.190]  It's bubbling.
[26:44.190 --> 26:45.190]  It looks real nice.
[26:45.190 --> 26:46.190]  It's clear.
[26:46.190 --> 26:47.190]  It's super clear.
[26:47.190 --> 26:48.190]  It's nice.
[26:48.190 --> 26:49.190]  Carb cap is on.
[26:49.190 --> 26:52.190]  It's like you guys are here with us taking a dab.
[26:52.190 --> 26:53.190]  He's got a sexy mohawk.
[26:53.190 --> 26:54.190]  It's hanging.
[26:54.190 --> 26:55.190]  It's a mess.
[26:55.190 --> 26:57.190]  That was a sexy extra.
[26:57.190 --> 26:59.190]  You've been practicing.
[26:59.190 --> 27:01.190]  It's going back in for seconds.
[27:01.190 --> 27:03.190]  He's going to finish the dab because he is a grown man.
[27:06.590 --> 27:08.590]  He's smacking his lips.
[27:08.590 --> 27:11.590]  We're going to ask him what he thinks about the rosin here as soon as he's done with his micro cough.
[27:11.590 --> 27:12.590]  He's not going to cough too hard.
[27:12.590 --> 27:13.590]  I can smell it.
[27:13.590 --> 27:15.590]  No, it's really smooth, actually.
[27:15.590 --> 27:16.590]  I'm a cougher, man.
[27:16.590 --> 27:19.590]  It doesn't have that burnt popsicle smell that I'm used to with rosin.
[27:19.590 --> 27:20.590]  It didn't have that taste at all.
[27:20.590 --> 27:21.590]  It was actually smooth.
[27:21.590 --> 27:22.590]  It was pleasant.
[27:22.590 --> 27:23.590]  It tasted like chem.
[27:23.590 --> 27:24.590]  It tasted like chem.
[27:24.590 --> 27:26.590]  Fill it in the front of my forehead nice, quick.
[27:26.590 --> 27:27.590]  That was beautiful.
[27:27.590 --> 27:30.590]  But now, again, do you think that's because of the starting material?
[27:30.590 --> 27:32.590]  It's because of both.
[27:32.590 --> 27:37.590]  It's because the starting material was good and the process that they had for making rosin was done right?
[27:37.590 --> 27:38.590]  Yeah.
[27:39.590 --> 27:41.590]  A lot of it is the starting material.
[27:41.590 --> 27:43.590]  You can't turn it.
[27:43.590 --> 27:46.590]  People are always like, you always got to remember the starting material.
[27:46.590 --> 27:48.590]  I say you're right.
[27:48.590 --> 27:51.590]  That's why they have flower categories in all these awards.
[27:55.590 --> 27:58.590]  The process is important, too.
[27:58.590 --> 28:01.590]  If you guys could see Giddy up, he took the end of that rosin.
[28:01.590 --> 28:02.590]  He exhaled.
[28:02.590 --> 28:03.590]  He went back in.
[28:03.590 --> 28:04.590]  He exhaled.
[28:04.590 --> 28:06.590]  He just relaxed back.
[28:06.590 --> 28:07.590]  He's sitting on the couch now.
[28:07.590 --> 28:09.590]  He's got that corner of the couch.
[28:09.590 --> 28:11.590]  He's just become one, his legs across.
[28:11.590 --> 28:15.590]  He's looking like a yogi over there.
[28:15.590 --> 28:20.590]  I've got a question for him, and I'm trying to give the man a moment so that he can get his brains back in his head after that dab.
[28:20.590 --> 28:26.590]  Heyo, we just took some dabs of this Calm Extracts, this Concentrate Smarter.
[28:26.590 --> 28:30.590]  Was this done in the first FDA certified lab?
[28:30.590 --> 28:31.590]  That's right.
[28:31.590 --> 28:42.590]  CanTech Labs is the first lab to get FDA approval on all of our shit.
[28:42.590 --> 28:44.590]  But what makes it even better?
[28:44.590 --> 28:45.590]  What state?
[28:45.590 --> 28:47.590]  It's made in Oklahoma.
[28:47.590 --> 28:48.590]  That's right.
[28:48.590 --> 28:50.590]  It's actually one of the reddest states around.
[28:50.590 --> 28:53.590]  We've got medical marijuana on the ballot June 26th.
[28:53.590 --> 28:56.590]  If anybody's listening in Oklahoma, make sure you go vote yes on 788.
[28:56.590 --> 28:58.590]  Vote yes.
[28:58.590 --> 29:00.590]  788.
[29:01.590 --> 29:11.590]  We passed hemp in Oklahoma, and now we're doing high CBD hemp and a lot of other stuff too.
[29:11.590 --> 29:13.590]  We're doing CBG.
[29:13.590 --> 29:20.590]  We're the only lab I know right now that will make a product specific blend for somebody and add CBG to it.
[29:20.590 --> 29:23.590]  Which cannabinoids can you put into that specific blend?
[29:23.590 --> 29:26.590]  We want to grill you right after you take a dab.
[29:26.590 --> 29:27.590]  I apologize for that.
[29:27.590 --> 29:28.590]  I'm loving it.
[29:28.590 --> 29:29.590]  Couldn't time it any better.
[29:29.590 --> 29:33.590]  I hit that rosin like my girlfriend was watching.
[29:33.590 --> 29:35.590]  You know what I'm saying?
[29:35.590 --> 29:37.590]  That shit was fire.
[29:37.590 --> 29:39.590]  I got Brave.
[29:39.590 --> 29:41.590]  Granny's here.
[29:41.590 --> 29:43.590]  Max is here.
[29:43.590 --> 29:44.590]  Jeff's here.
[29:44.590 --> 29:45.590]  Everybody's watching me smoke rosin.
[29:45.590 --> 29:47.590]  We all smoked rosin, though.
[29:47.590 --> 29:49.590]  We're all chilling on the couch.
[29:49.590 --> 29:51.590]  My face is high.
[29:51.590 --> 29:55.590]  It's coming along so quick.
[29:55.590 --> 29:56.590]  Which cannabinoids?
[29:56.590 --> 29:58.590]  Which cannabinoids?
[29:58.590 --> 30:02.590]  There's no THC, so no Delta 9.
[30:02.590 --> 30:09.590]  As far as I know, no Delta 8 either, and that would kind of be the one that people would be curious about because it's new.
[30:09.590 --> 30:10.590]  You know what I mean?
[30:10.590 --> 30:17.590]  It's not THC Delta 9, which in a lot of the states that particular verbiage is in the law.
[30:17.590 --> 30:29.590]  So if you have a compound that is not that, you can kind of argue that, you know, while it is THC, but it's not THC Delta 9, which is what you're going to ask.
[30:29.590 --> 30:32.590]  Okay, so I have a question then.
[30:32.590 --> 30:39.590]  Is there any chance that smoking this would cause someone to have a hot UA?
[30:39.590 --> 30:41.590]  Say you work for the federal government.
[30:41.590 --> 30:43.590]  Yeah.
[30:43.590 --> 30:44.590]  Say you work for the federal government.
[30:44.590 --> 30:46.590]  And you smoke this?
[30:46.590 --> 30:47.590]  You smoke this product?
[30:47.590 --> 30:48.590]  Wonderful product.
[30:48.590 --> 30:50.590]  No, you will not.
[30:50.590 --> 30:51.590]  You will not.
[30:51.590 --> 30:57.590]  You have to watch that about CBDs, and that is honestly one of the best questions that you could ask.
[30:57.590 --> 31:11.590]  So we use Proverde out of Massachusetts to test all of our, to test all of our, we have all of our COAs, our SOPs, the way that we produce our hemp, we have no THC.
[31:11.590 --> 31:12.590]  Okay.
[31:12.590 --> 31:14.590]  And we keep all of our test stores to back it up.
[31:14.590 --> 31:25.590]  On top of that, as we were opening this company, we did test batches with our people that smoked, and we didn't have people pissing hot.
[31:25.590 --> 31:32.590]  We did have people that smoked other people's product that didn't smoke any THC that did piss hot.
[31:32.590 --> 31:33.590]  Yes.
[31:33.590 --> 31:39.590]  There's a lot of places in Oklahoma right now because the CBD market hit their crazy, and they popped up like vape shops when vape shops popped up.
[31:39.590 --> 31:42.590]  There's a lot of people who are selling stuff that pisses hot.
[31:42.590 --> 31:50.590]  There's a lot of people that are using fraudulent tests or like, you know, getting one test done on something and reusing its deal.
[31:50.590 --> 31:56.590]  But what's being set forth right now in Oklahoma is a means to enforce all that, you know, just like it happened in Colorado.
[31:56.590 --> 32:07.590]  They're doing it like that on the CBD side, prepping for what we polled at 56% in favor of Bill 788, passing medical marijuana in Oklahoma.
[32:07.590 --> 32:08.590]  Who would that?
[32:08.590 --> 32:11.590]  Yeah, I was going to say, who would put THC in a CBD product?
[32:11.590 --> 32:14.590]  It's not that they're putting THC in a CBD product.
[32:14.590 --> 32:15.590]  They're allowing on accident, most likely.
[32:15.590 --> 32:20.590]  They're not effectively removing any THC from the product.
[32:20.590 --> 32:29.590]  If they're not processing everything right, you know, there can be trace amounts of THC in it.
[32:29.590 --> 32:33.590]  That's going to cost people jobs, child support cases.
[32:33.590 --> 32:35.590]  That's going to wreck people's lives.
[32:36.590 --> 32:39.590]  It definitely will, and it definitely has.
[32:39.590 --> 32:41.590]  And there's a lot of products out there.
[32:41.590 --> 32:51.590]  And, you know, my brother didn't make any friends when he started testing people's product, you know, and going, well.
[32:51.590 --> 32:52.590]  Hey, look at you guys.
[32:52.590 --> 32:55.590]  This came back, you know, testing hot for THC.
[32:55.590 --> 32:59.590]  Like, it's not what we're doing here, you know, like.
[32:59.590 --> 33:01.590]  You're going to get people in trouble.
[33:01.590 --> 33:04.590]  So it's Calm Extracts, K-A-L-M Extracts.
[33:04.590 --> 33:07.590]  You said that's available in all 50 states.
[33:07.590 --> 33:19.590]  You can check out CanTech Labs, that's C-A-N-T-E-K-L-A-B-S, and get a store locator for, like, our pure cannaceutical line, the Calm line.
[33:19.590 --> 33:30.590]  This is where the Giddy Up CBD line of smokable CBD products is going to be coming from with my particular strain of Terps.
[33:30.590 --> 33:32.590]  You know, like, it's going to be real nice.
[33:32.590 --> 33:39.590]  It's going to have everything is going to have online batch number testing so you can check the test scores to, you know.
[33:39.590 --> 33:40.590]  That's what we need.
[33:40.590 --> 33:45.590]  Are these cannabis-derived Terps that are going back in, or are they food-grade Terps?
[33:45.590 --> 33:48.590]  Cannabis-derived terpenes, no THC.
[33:48.590 --> 33:50.590]  All cannabis-derived.
[33:50.590 --> 33:51.590]  It depends on which ones.
[33:51.590 --> 33:53.590]  It really depends on which ones.
[33:53.590 --> 33:55.590]  Some are actually hemp-derived terpenes.
[33:55.590 --> 34:03.590]  Some are other natural plant-derived terpenes, depending upon which terpene profile I want to use.
[34:03.590 --> 34:07.590]  The only thing I'm really disappointed about on this packaging is your face is not on it.
[34:07.590 --> 34:09.590]  And that's because...
[34:10.590 --> 34:11.590]  I need that Mohawk package.
[34:11.590 --> 34:12.590]  It's coming.
[34:12.590 --> 34:14.590]  It's coming.
[34:15.590 --> 34:17.590]  Unless this is you laying down on the M.
[34:17.590 --> 34:18.590]  No.
[34:18.590 --> 34:19.590]  Did you model for that?
[34:19.590 --> 34:20.590]  No, that didn't.
[34:20.590 --> 34:27.590]  That right there is a house product with terpenes that the lab has been working on.
[34:29.590 --> 34:45.590]  Now that I'm actually on as part owner and part shareholder, we're going to establish a licensing agreement between me and the company that brings the Giddy Up CBD line that I've been wanting to debut there.
[34:45.590 --> 34:52.590]  And that will be distributed to our distributors across the country and it will be available pretty much everywhere.
[34:52.590 --> 34:55.590]  We're the same people that produce our quantum CBD water.
[34:55.590 --> 34:59.590]  Our waters are in Arowan, in California.
[35:00.590 --> 35:02.590]  They're in a lot of stores in Oklahoma.
[35:02.590 --> 35:04.590]  And really, it's a wide range.
[35:04.590 --> 35:07.590]  We've got distributors all over the country that send out our water.
[35:07.590 --> 35:15.590]  And to be perfectly honest, we've given away hundreds and hundreds of thousands of bottles to get out into the market.
[35:15.590 --> 35:16.590]  Excellent.
[35:16.590 --> 35:17.590]  Thanks for getting CBD out there.
[35:17.590 --> 35:19.590]  More people need access to CBD.
[35:19.590 --> 35:21.590]  More people need access to actual CBD.
[35:21.590 --> 35:24.590]  There's too much snake oil and bullshit out there.
[35:24.590 --> 35:25.590]  Well, you don't want snake.
[35:25.590 --> 35:26.590]  It's cool to see somebody...
[35:26.590 --> 35:27.590]  Yeah, no, no.
[35:27.590 --> 35:28.590]  You don't want Chinese.
[35:28.590 --> 35:29.590]  You don't want fish oil.
[35:29.590 --> 35:30.590]  You don't want dragon's blood.
[35:30.590 --> 35:31.590]  You want actual CBD.
[35:31.590 --> 35:32.590]  Yeah.
[35:32.590 --> 35:33.590]  And that's a big part of it.
[35:33.590 --> 35:36.590]  You want every cannabinoid you can get.
[35:36.590 --> 35:44.590]  So, us being guys that offer an extract too that has CBG, which not a lot of people do.
[35:44.590 --> 35:46.590]  What's the benefit of CBG?
[35:48.590 --> 35:50.590]  There's a lot of benefits to CBG.
[35:50.590 --> 35:56.590]  And without getting too technical into it, CBG really kind of affects your focus and your head.
[35:57.590 --> 36:06.590]  It's really, while CBD is healthy body, CBG apparently appears to be really healthy mind.
[36:06.590 --> 36:09.590]  Is that the one they're saying will help us with Alzheimer's?
[36:09.590 --> 36:12.590]  It's one of the CBGV is one of the ones into that.
[36:12.590 --> 36:15.590]  And CBG is also the precursor to everything.
[36:15.590 --> 36:21.590]  So, almost everything that exists in the cannabinoid, I like to equate it as stem cells for weed.
[36:21.590 --> 36:22.590]  Ooh.
[36:22.590 --> 36:23.590]  The precursor.
[36:23.590 --> 36:24.590]  Ooh, you like that, don't you?
[36:24.590 --> 36:25.590]  Trademark.
[36:25.590 --> 36:26.590]  Trademark.
[36:26.590 --> 36:28.590]  Don't you motherfuckers go putting stem cell shit on.
[36:28.590 --> 36:31.590]  I don't want to hear none of you motherfuckers talk about stem cells.
[36:31.590 --> 36:32.590]  That's my shit.
[36:32.590 --> 36:33.590]  Hashtag weed stem cells.
[36:33.590 --> 36:34.590]  Hashtag weed stem cells.
[36:34.590 --> 36:36.590]  Hashtag giddy up stem cells in your weed.
[36:36.590 --> 36:37.590]  Hashtag giddy cells.
[36:37.590 --> 36:39.590]  Get it concentrated, giddy cells.
[36:39.590 --> 36:41.590]  That's the way I like to explain it.
[36:41.590 --> 36:47.590]  I don't like, honestly, man, I can't wait, man.
[36:47.590 --> 36:56.590]  We're so close to just really having such solid data on isolated cannabinoids.
[36:56.590 --> 37:01.590]  Bro, that's the cool thing about this plant is when you start mixing these in ratios,
[37:01.590 --> 37:05.590]  I love a 10% CBD to CBG ratio.
[37:05.590 --> 37:10.590]  I've always said, I don't know about always, for a long time I've been saying that we'll be able to go into,
[37:10.590 --> 37:12.590]  I don't know what type of facility it'll be.
[37:12.590 --> 37:14.590]  Maybe it's similar to a pharmacy in my mind.
[37:14.590 --> 37:17.590]  You hand them your little card, and your card's got your printout on it.
[37:17.590 --> 37:22.590]  I want this much CBD, this much CBG, this much THC, this much limonene, this much pineal,
[37:22.590 --> 37:25.590]  and each of us would just go in and stick out our Slurpee cup and concentrate.
[37:25.590 --> 37:27.590]  We'd fill up your Slurpee cup with your exact order.
[37:27.590 --> 37:29.590]  There's four grams of the Jeff mix.
[37:29.590 --> 37:31.590]  I'll tell you, we're not far from that.
[37:31.590 --> 37:33.590]  I'm going to that 7-Eleven.
[37:33.590 --> 37:37.590]  Of course we all would, but this is what the isolation of cannabinoids is all about, man.
[37:37.590 --> 37:38.590]  We're getting close.
[37:38.590 --> 37:41.590]  Being able to make a special mixture before you go to bed, you know what I mean?
[37:41.590 --> 37:42.590]  Yeah.
[37:42.590 --> 37:45.590]  Make a little bit of THC, a little CBV.
[37:45.590 --> 37:48.590]  So then on that note, let's talk about medicinally.
[37:48.590 --> 37:53.590]  We can isolate true formulas to fight specific...
[37:53.590 --> 37:55.590]  To give us desired effects, yeah.
[37:55.590 --> 37:56.590]  Absolutely.
[37:56.590 --> 37:59.590]  If we look at all the properties of the different cannabinoids...
[37:59.590 --> 38:05.590]  We can make formulas to help ladies that are going through breast cancer or prostate cancer.
[38:05.590 --> 38:07.590]  I mean, that's, you know, I'm just throwing stuff out there.
[38:07.590 --> 38:10.590]  People with seizures, people with Alzheimer's, people with brain injuries.
[38:11.590 --> 38:15.590]  But we will be able to isolate formulas specific to those.
[38:15.590 --> 38:16.590]  Yeah, design it.
[38:16.590 --> 38:17.590]  Design it.
[38:17.590 --> 38:18.590]  And we're already doing that almost right now.
[38:18.590 --> 38:21.590]  I think the plant does an amazing job of doing it itself in its natural form.
[38:21.590 --> 38:24.590]  But I mean, we can definitely assist it.
[38:24.590 --> 38:27.590]  All we're doing is just moving stuff around, you know what I mean?
[38:27.590 --> 38:33.590]  And the cool thing is, and the reason why we say anything and why you'll hear, you know,
[38:33.590 --> 38:37.590]  where you hear people going, it's the cure for everything.
[38:37.590 --> 38:47.590]  The reason why there's some truth to that is because of the versatility of the effects of the different compounds in the plant.
[38:47.590 --> 38:48.590]  There's antiviral.
[38:48.590 --> 38:50.590]  There's anti-inflammatory.
[38:50.590 --> 38:51.590]  There's anti-inflammatory.
[38:51.590 --> 38:52.590]  There's neuropathic.
[38:52.590 --> 38:53.590]  Anti-fungal.
[38:53.590 --> 38:54.590]  Neurotectorate.
[38:54.590 --> 39:01.590]  You know, there's so many different things that the plant can do that when you start isolating the compounds in the plant
[39:02.590 --> 39:07.590]  and tracking back their ratios to see what interacts with different people.
[39:07.590 --> 39:09.590]  And maybe it's something by blood type.
[39:09.590 --> 39:16.590]  Maybe it's something by genetics that is identified 50 years from now of working with the plant and isolating the plant.
[39:16.590 --> 39:22.590]  That we will derive the cures for most of man's sicknesses from this plant and plants like it.
[39:22.590 --> 39:23.590]  It's that technology.
[39:23.590 --> 39:25.590]  It's that time it takes to do it.
[39:25.590 --> 39:27.590]  And that's why.
[39:28.590 --> 39:29.590]  And it is.
[39:29.590 --> 39:31.590]  You said, and plants like it.
[39:31.590 --> 39:38.590]  Because we know different spices have the same holistic effects that pharmaceuticals have.
[39:38.590 --> 39:41.590]  And you found that out with the apple cider vinegar, did you not?
[39:41.590 --> 39:45.590]  That apple cider vinegar sped up that cough so much it got it out of me.
[39:45.590 --> 39:48.590]  So I don't know the exact science behind this and I'm going to sound completely ignorant.
[39:48.590 --> 39:54.590]  But we can do DNA tests on ourselves now and we can find markers in our DNA that are going to predict,
[39:54.590 --> 39:55.590]  hey, you may get Alzheimer's.
[39:55.590 --> 39:59.590]  Hey, you may be prone to cancer because of these genetic markers in your DNA.
[39:59.590 --> 40:01.590]  I listen to a lot of Joe Rogan.
[40:01.590 --> 40:02.590]  I don't absorb it all.
[40:02.590 --> 40:03.590]  I'm driving.
[40:03.590 --> 40:05.590]  But that's the short version of what I understand.
[40:05.590 --> 40:09.590]  One day we'll be able to match up those genetic markers with our cannabinoid needs.
[40:09.590 --> 40:12.590]  You'll print out, you'll take a little blood, you'll get your DNA.
[40:12.590 --> 40:14.590]  They'll say, hey, your DNA is shaped like this.
[40:14.590 --> 40:15.590]  You're going to get Alzheimer's.
[40:15.590 --> 40:17.590]  You're going to get prostate cancer.
[40:17.590 --> 40:18.590]  Which cannabinoids do you need?
[40:18.590 --> 40:19.590]  Which terps do you need?
[40:19.590 --> 40:20.590]  Here you go.
[40:20.590 --> 40:21.590]  Start consuming.
[40:21.590 --> 40:22.590]  If you eat, eat this.
[40:22.590 --> 40:23.590]  If you dab, dab this.
[40:23.590 --> 40:28.590]  We'll be able to dial it in based on a printout and we'll be able to use it all science together.
[40:28.590 --> 40:29.590]  That's the future, bro.
[40:29.590 --> 40:30.590]  You know what's great?
[40:30.590 --> 40:31.590]  All medicine will be that way.
[40:31.590 --> 40:35.590]  We're all so fucking high right now that this makes perfect sense.
[40:35.590 --> 40:37.590]  It makes all the sense, dude.
[40:37.590 --> 40:38.590]  I'm confident.
[40:38.590 --> 40:39.590]  But it's truth.
[40:39.590 --> 40:40.590]  I heard Joe Rogan say it.
[40:40.590 --> 40:41.590]  It's got to be real.
[40:41.590 --> 40:42.590]  Think about it in 50 years.
[40:42.590 --> 40:43.590]  Think about it, dude.
[40:43.590 --> 40:47.590]  I mean, look at what we, I mean, and let's step back and let's get a little deeper for just a quick second.
[40:47.590 --> 40:51.590]  Look at what we've done in the last 50 years.
[40:51.590 --> 40:53.590]  I'm of a special part of the generation.
[40:53.590 --> 40:55.590]  I'm the last of an analog generation.
[40:55.590 --> 41:03.590]  I was born into an analog world and I became a young adult in a digital age when it showed up.
[41:03.590 --> 41:11.590]  And, you know, I remember my uncles only having physical toys to play with.
[41:11.590 --> 41:12.590]  Yes.
[41:12.590 --> 41:15.590]  And I started life with physical toys and up until I was a teenager.
[41:16.590 --> 41:21.590]  And then when I was a teenager, at home video games came out, computers came out.
[41:21.590 --> 41:23.590]  Like the world changed.
[41:23.590 --> 41:25.590]  Oh, you got a pager?
[41:25.590 --> 41:26.590]  I had a pager.
[41:26.590 --> 41:27.590]  Ooh.
[41:27.590 --> 41:28.590]  That's right.
[41:28.590 --> 41:30.590]  I was like the first generation was like a kid had a pager.
[41:30.590 --> 41:31.590]  You know what I mean?
[41:31.590 --> 41:32.590]  Had a pager.
[41:32.590 --> 41:35.590]  My parents brought home an Amana radar range.
[41:35.590 --> 41:36.590]  That's a special.
[41:36.590 --> 41:37.590]  It was huge.
[41:37.590 --> 41:38.590]  Imagine, imagine.
[41:38.590 --> 41:41.590]  I remember the color TV we brought home.
[41:41.590 --> 41:43.590]  I mean, I'm dating myself.
[41:43.590 --> 41:45.590]  Actually, I remember our color TV too.
[41:49.590 --> 41:51.590]  He said he tracked cassette converters.
[41:51.590 --> 41:57.590]  While the time may seem a little off in my situation, you have to also remember we was poor as buh.
[41:57.590 --> 42:00.590]  We was poor, poor growing up.
[42:00.590 --> 42:07.590]  So, I remember my black and white TV when I was like five we got a color TV and it like blew my mind.
[42:07.590 --> 42:09.590]  They got color on that thing?
[42:09.590 --> 42:11.590]  Oh my God.
[42:12.590 --> 42:18.590]  But, I mean, look, that's a special time in like human history to exist and to be born.
[42:18.590 --> 42:26.590]  Like a time where you go from industrial age and steam and, you know, fossil fuels to literally.
[42:26.590 --> 42:28.590]  Podcasting and Instagram live?
[42:28.590 --> 42:32.590]  Digital nuclear fucking worldwide communication.
[42:32.590 --> 42:34.590]  Everybody is now.
[42:34.590 --> 42:35.590]  You know what I mean?
[42:35.590 --> 42:39.590]  There's no lag between the exchange of information.
[42:39.590 --> 42:41.590]  But that's not always for the best.
[42:41.590 --> 42:42.590]  Nobody said that.
[42:42.590 --> 42:43.590]  No, no, no.
[42:43.590 --> 42:45.590]  But I'll tell you what, but it is different.
[42:45.590 --> 42:47.590]  It is very different.
[42:47.590 --> 42:51.590]  And because of that it changes our whole culture and it changes us as human beings.
[42:51.590 --> 43:02.590]  If you look at 50 years in the future, 100 years in the future, we're going to have so much information that comes to the human body,
[43:02.590 --> 43:11.590]  that comes to the world that exists around us, the ways to quantify that data, the things to do with it, stem cells,
[43:11.590 --> 43:16.590]  stem cells like cannabis becoming legal and being isolated as it fits in.
[43:16.590 --> 43:24.590]  They should tag the people in this room with some sort of tag and say, hey, when they die, we got to check out their lungs and see what all these different concentrates were.
[43:24.590 --> 43:28.590]  I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, I'll say it publicly.
[43:29.590 --> 43:36.590]  I've been saying that forever, that we're like the crash test dummies for smoking all this.
[43:36.590 --> 43:38.590]  Oh yeah, we're dabbing terps.
[43:38.590 --> 43:41.590]  Who knows if we should even be dabbing terps at the concentrates we're dabbing terps.
[43:41.590 --> 43:45.590]  And when we first started dabbing, titanium nails, right?
[43:45.590 --> 43:53.590]  I'll let my mom handle it as she sees fit, but I'll donate my fucking shit to science to study me as a lifetime fucking smoker.
[43:53.590 --> 43:54.590]  Me too.
[43:54.590 --> 43:56.590]  As a daily fucking concentrate smoker.
[43:56.590 --> 43:58.590]  I have been a lifetime smoker.
[43:58.590 --> 44:01.590]  Not always concentrates, but always flour.
[44:01.590 --> 44:03.590]  The NFL science program for concussion.
[44:03.590 --> 44:06.590]  I'll put my money where my mouth is too.
[44:06.590 --> 44:08.590]  Actually, I'll put my body where my mouth is too.
[44:08.590 --> 44:10.590]  Yeah, you can have it all. I don't need it once I'm dead.
[44:10.590 --> 44:13.590]  You can have it all. You can have that box filled with it.
[44:13.590 --> 44:15.590]  Ghost, I'll be digital. That's what I'm talking about.
[44:15.590 --> 44:17.590]  Can we get there in our lifetime, bro?
[44:17.590 --> 44:24.590]  Can me and you be 85 years old and they be like, yo, homie, we can download you into a robot.
[44:24.590 --> 44:26.590]  We got some stem cells. We're going to shoot them into your neck.
[44:26.590 --> 44:27.590]  You'll be seven years old.
[44:27.590 --> 44:29.590]  I can put a laser on your shit, bro.
[44:29.590 --> 44:33.590]  Make me like nine foot tall, bro, or rockets and shit.
[44:33.590 --> 44:36.590]  If you could feel that good, would we even want to consume cannabis anymore?
[44:36.590 --> 44:38.590]  Would it be like, nah, I could fly and shit, bro.
[44:38.590 --> 44:40.590]  I'd download strains, homie.
[44:40.590 --> 44:42.590]  Have you smoked weed? Have you smoked weed before?
[44:42.590 --> 44:43.590]  I'd download strains.
[44:43.590 --> 44:44.590]  I'd be like...
[44:44.590 --> 44:46.590]  You should have a USB port in the back of your neck.
[44:46.590 --> 44:48.590]  Everything's always better on weed.
[44:48.590 --> 44:50.590]  I guess you're right. I guess you're right.
[44:50.590 --> 44:53.590]  Even if I could fly already, I'd still want to fly with some dabs.
[44:53.590 --> 44:56.590]  I really like how we hijacked your serious podcast.
[44:56.590 --> 45:01.590]  I love it. We got 15 solid minutes of talking about concentrates, and now we're talking about life.
[45:01.590 --> 45:03.590]  People will listen. They love hanging out.
[45:03.590 --> 45:06.590]  There's a hashtag, hashtag theylikeitwhenweramble.
[45:06.590 --> 45:07.590]  Oh, yes.
[45:07.590 --> 45:13.590]  A lot of people, we take it for granted that we're sitting at a table with a Darby home rig, with a Hitman rig,
[45:13.590 --> 45:15.590]  with several jars of high-quality concentrate.
[45:15.590 --> 45:17.590]  Baller jars, you guys. Not just little...
[45:17.590 --> 45:19.590]  Not just like granny gram jars.
[45:19.590 --> 45:25.590]  Seven grams, four grams, six grams, and then a couple ounces of flour sitting on the table.
[45:25.590 --> 45:28.590]  There's a lot of shit going on here. We are spoiled.
[45:28.590 --> 45:31.590]  There are people listening in your hometown in Oklahoma that can't have this on the table.
[45:31.590 --> 45:35.590]  There are people in the middle of somewhere in Kentucky that can't do this.
[45:35.590 --> 45:37.590]  Where you're from, there are folks with this.
[45:37.590 --> 45:41.590]  People in Texas would go to fucking jail for having this on the table.
[45:41.590 --> 45:46.590]  That's the time to be alive, too, is the time going from when this came out, from being illegal,
[45:46.590 --> 45:53.590]  and being something that criminals did and stuff like that, to everyday mom and pop smoking, everyone smokes.
[45:55.590 --> 45:58.590]  There's still motherfuckers in jail on that shit.
[45:58.590 --> 46:03.590]  It's so crazy, we're out here going to cannabis clubs and there's still motherfuckers in jail.
[46:03.590 --> 46:06.590]  Yeah, these guys just showed up and threw concentrate on the table.
[46:06.590 --> 46:08.590]  Chin in head, free chin in head.
[46:08.590 --> 46:10.590]  Nothing to worry about. No problems, no stress.
[46:10.590 --> 46:15.590]  It is mind-blowing that in Texas, a little bit of weed is a misdemeanor,
[46:15.590 --> 46:18.590]  but a gram of concentrate is a felon.
[46:18.590 --> 46:20.590]  It's that way in Florida, too.
[46:20.590 --> 46:21.590]  We would all be fucked.
[46:21.590 --> 46:25.590]  If this were Texas and one cop came in here, there's enough concentrate here to fuck us all.
[46:25.590 --> 46:28.590]  No, it's not just the concentrate, bro.
[46:28.590 --> 46:31.590]  I tell you what, this bill...
[46:31.590 --> 46:35.590]  I'm not going to talk about the Emotech machines that surround us.
[46:35.590 --> 46:37.590]  Yeah, you know...
[46:39.590 --> 46:41.590]  I can see two Obies.
[46:42.590 --> 46:47.590]  I tell you what, there's only one licensed facility in the state of Oklahoma
[46:47.590 --> 46:52.590]  that equipment like this can even set in for that purpose.
[46:52.590 --> 46:54.590]  And that's ours.
[46:54.590 --> 46:55.590]  That's huge.
[46:55.590 --> 46:57.590]  That's a major stride.
[46:57.590 --> 46:59.590]  I'm really proud of that.
[46:59.590 --> 47:01.590]  Everyone should be giddy up.
[47:01.590 --> 47:02.590]  I'm really proud of that.
[47:02.590 --> 47:05.590]  The people listening have to meet some sketchy dude in a parking lot at Walmart.
[47:05.590 --> 47:07.590]  Surfax is...
[47:07.590 --> 47:09.590]  You know what I mean?
[47:09.590 --> 47:11.590]  That's what we're here for.
[47:11.590 --> 47:15.590]  That's why we're still activists and we're not just out here trying to get rich.
[47:15.590 --> 47:20.590]  That's why we still put in the work because there are a lot of people in America
[47:20.590 --> 47:22.590]  that do not have safe access.
[47:22.590 --> 47:24.590]  I have to say something before I forget because I am high.
[47:24.590 --> 47:28.590]  When Jeff said about meeting the shady person in the parking lot...
[47:28.590 --> 47:32.590]  Guys, don't be buying your weed off Instagram.
[47:32.590 --> 47:34.590]  I don't want to hear,
[47:34.590 --> 47:37.590]  I gave the person my money and got nothing.
[47:37.590 --> 47:39.590]  Come on.
[47:39.590 --> 47:41.590]  Good weed doesn't need to be shipped.
[47:41.590 --> 47:46.590]  If somebody that looks like Jerry Krasicki tries to sell you weed on the Internet,
[47:46.590 --> 47:47.590]  don't do it.
[47:47.590 --> 47:48.590]  Okay?
[47:48.590 --> 47:50.590]  Okay?
[47:50.590 --> 47:54.590]  He's got curly gray hair like a goatee.
[47:54.590 --> 47:58.590]  He always got pictures with people's weed and shit.
[47:58.590 --> 48:00.590]  Somebody have your face up, Jeff?
[48:00.590 --> 48:03.590]  Somebody had a fake Rasta Jeff account trying to sell people weed.
[48:03.590 --> 48:06.590]  Luckily enough people knew who I was to where they're like,
[48:06.590 --> 48:09.590]  bro, shut this down because I've got a reputation where I always say
[48:09.590 --> 48:11.590]  I'm not going to sell you weed online.
[48:11.590 --> 48:12.590]  None of us.
[48:12.590 --> 48:13.590]  None of us.
[48:13.590 --> 48:17.590]  If we're trying to advance the cause, we're not going to do that.
[48:17.590 --> 48:18.590]  Damn.
[48:18.590 --> 48:19.590]  Poor Jerry.
[48:19.590 --> 48:20.590]  Jerry's a good dude.
[48:20.590 --> 48:21.590]  Shout out to Jerry.
[48:21.590 --> 48:22.590]  Shout out to Jerry.
[48:22.590 --> 48:23.590]  He would appreciate it.
[48:23.590 --> 48:25.590]  Miss Rad Reifer gets a lot of them.
[48:25.590 --> 48:28.590]  She posts a lot of pictures so it's easy.
[48:28.590 --> 48:30.590]  Yeah.
[48:30.590 --> 48:32.590]  Yeah, she is a fantastic grower.
[48:32.590 --> 48:36.590]  I think it's kind of sorry that we even have to say don't do this.
[48:36.590 --> 48:38.590]  But don't do it.
[48:38.590 --> 48:43.590]  It runs deeper than just people faking people out on the internet, bro.
[48:43.590 --> 48:49.590]  I know people out there that set up entire companies to knock off
[48:49.590 --> 48:52.590]  somebody's product and sell it to a particular state.
[48:52.590 --> 48:54.590]  You hear about it.
[48:54.590 --> 48:59.590]  That's why brass, in my opinion, that's why Brass Knuckles is getting sued.
[48:59.590 --> 49:01.590]  You know what I'm saying?
[49:01.590 --> 49:02.590]  Because you think it was a bunch of knockoffs?
[49:02.590 --> 49:04.590]  Because I think it was a bunch of fucking knockoffs, man,
[49:04.590 --> 49:09.590]  that were out there going and people tested them and they hit hot.
[49:09.590 --> 49:18.590]  Because I have people try to call and sell me from China Brass Knuckles pins.
[49:18.590 --> 49:20.590]  I have the emails on my computer.
[49:20.590 --> 49:21.590]  I have a factory in China.
[49:21.590 --> 49:23.590]  I can't wait to find some Chinese, Irish, and ethnic seeds.
[49:23.590 --> 49:29.590]  Trying to sell me their straight up pins and put my oil in it for who, whatever.
[49:29.590 --> 49:33.590]  There's no doubt in my mind that the guys at Brass Knuckles,
[49:33.590 --> 49:35.590]  they take it seriously.
[49:35.590 --> 49:36.590]  They love this shit.
[49:36.590 --> 49:37.590]  They're like us.
[49:37.590 --> 49:38.590]  You know what I mean?
[49:38.590 --> 49:43.590]  They live this life, this is what I call the Prop 215 life of fucking forwarding
[49:43.590 --> 49:48.590]  the plant and the culture at the same time as trying to go legit,
[49:48.590 --> 49:52.590]  trying to cross over.
[49:52.590 --> 49:54.590]  They test shit.
[49:54.590 --> 49:56.590]  They test the oil they use.
[49:56.590 --> 50:01.590]  You don't not test your oil at this level.
[50:01.590 --> 50:04.590]  Somebody's going to buy it and test it and find Michael Buten.
[50:04.590 --> 50:06.590]  You know that's going to happen.
[50:06.590 --> 50:07.590]  Yeah, they're going to find something in there.
[50:07.590 --> 50:08.590]  You know that's going to happen.
[50:08.590 --> 50:12.590]  I tested every product that we sold here in Colorado that I made.
[50:12.590 --> 50:15.590]  I tested every product that we sold in Nevada.
[50:15.590 --> 50:17.590]  I tested every product that's been sold to Oklahoma City.
[50:17.590 --> 50:20.590]  It's a new facility.
[50:20.590 --> 50:26.590]  I do not operate in California for anybody other than myself
[50:26.590 --> 50:31.590]  and my immediate surrounding when I go to do runs out there.
[50:31.590 --> 50:33.590]  It was like we're going to get your stuff in California.
[50:33.590 --> 50:35.590]  I'm like, yeah.
[50:35.590 --> 50:39.590]  Because 80% of the weed would not pass testing.
[50:39.590 --> 50:40.590]  It does not pass testing.
[50:40.590 --> 50:42.590]  They test it.
[50:42.590 --> 50:46.590]  People still sell weed that has been sprayed with shit or is funky.
[50:46.590 --> 50:47.590]  I'm not going to waste my time.
[50:47.590 --> 50:50.590]  They sell it to the clubs and people buy it.
[50:50.590 --> 50:53.590]  Those people test it on their own just because they want to know.
[50:53.590 --> 50:57.590]  They're still finding out that people are still spraying Eagle 20, Havid.
[50:57.590 --> 51:00.590]  But do you think all that will change now in California?
[51:00.590 --> 51:01.590]  Of course it's going to change.
[51:01.590 --> 51:02.590]  It changed here.
[51:02.590 --> 51:05.590]  Here's this crazy little bubble that's going to pop.
[51:05.590 --> 51:08.590]  You want to hear how some shit's going to go?
[51:08.590 --> 51:10.590]  Tell us, oh wise one.
[51:10.590 --> 51:13.590]  CO2 is going to try to make a comeback, right?
[51:13.590 --> 51:14.590]  I believe that.
[51:14.590 --> 51:15.590]  Over the next 18 months.
[51:15.590 --> 51:16.590]  Don't do that to us.
[51:16.590 --> 51:17.590]  I can't help that.
[51:17.590 --> 51:19.590]  People taste things.
[51:19.590 --> 51:20.590]  People do taste things.
[51:20.590 --> 51:21.590]  But check me.
[51:21.590 --> 51:22.590]  I'm with Max.
[51:22.590 --> 51:23.590]  Check me.
[51:23.590 --> 51:24.590]  People do taste things.
[51:24.590 --> 51:25.590]  I'd rather smoke rosin.
[51:25.590 --> 51:28.590]  I'm not a CO2 fan.
[51:28.590 --> 51:30.590]  I'm not a CO2 fan.
[51:30.590 --> 51:33.590]  Would you smoke CO2 before rosin?
[51:33.590 --> 51:35.590]  No, I'd rather smoke rosin.
[51:35.590 --> 51:36.590]  Okay.
[51:36.590 --> 51:37.590]  I don't smoke CO2.
[51:37.590 --> 51:39.590]  I think all of us here are saying yes to that.
[51:39.590 --> 51:41.590]  Hey, if you give me a CO2 pen and I hit it,
[51:41.590 --> 51:44.590]  and you don't tell me it's CO2 and I hit it,
[51:45.590 --> 51:47.590]  I'm mad.
[51:47.590 --> 51:48.590]  Yep.
[51:48.590 --> 51:50.590]  I get a shitty attitude real quick.
[51:50.590 --> 51:53.590]  I about fist fought Addison the first time I ever met him.
[51:53.590 --> 51:56.590]  I feel the same way about Mexican CBD, bad Mexican CBD.
[51:56.590 --> 51:57.590]  Ugh.
[51:57.590 --> 51:58.590]  Ugh.
[51:58.590 --> 51:59.590]  We're fine.
[51:59.590 --> 52:00.590]  Ugh.
[52:00.590 --> 52:02.590]  Everybody loves the Mexican CBD.
[52:02.590 --> 52:04.590]  You guys have ran with our fucking jokes.
[52:04.590 --> 52:05.590]  The lifestyle.
[52:05.590 --> 52:08.590]  I literally had somebody fucking come to me and was like,
[52:08.590 --> 52:11.590]  hey, I heard some shit.
[52:11.590 --> 52:13.590]  It's like, what?
[52:14.590 --> 52:16.590]  I heard what Mexican CBD is.
[52:18.590 --> 52:20.590]  I was like, cool.
[52:20.590 --> 52:22.590]  That's the joke.
[52:22.590 --> 52:23.590]  That's the joke?
[52:23.590 --> 52:26.590]  They're like, I heard you do Mexican CBD.
[52:27.590 --> 52:30.590]  I was like, bro, I go to bed at 9 o'clock at night.
[52:30.590 --> 52:32.590]  I can't stay awake.
[52:32.590 --> 52:34.590]  I wake up at 530.
[52:35.590 --> 52:36.590]  The fuck are you talking about?
[52:36.590 --> 52:38.590]  It's a goddamn joke.
[52:40.590 --> 52:42.590]  I'm not going to edit any of that.
[52:42.590 --> 52:44.590]  It's going to be going out just like that.
[52:44.590 --> 52:46.590]  I've said this on my live before too.
[52:46.590 --> 52:48.590]  Gretna, you're all red.
[52:48.590 --> 52:50.590]  I'm just like, am I really part of this?
[52:50.590 --> 52:57.590]  We always laugh and joke because everybody imagines this fucking crazy lifestyle, bro.
[52:57.590 --> 52:59.590]  It is a crazy lifestyle.
[52:59.590 --> 53:03.590]  You more so than probably any of us sitting here.
[53:03.590 --> 53:04.590]  My life is chill, bro.
[53:04.590 --> 53:06.590]  Dude, look at your hair.
[53:06.590 --> 53:08.590]  Your hair says I like to party.
[53:08.590 --> 53:11.590]  If I didn't know you, I'd be like, bro, where's the party at?
[53:11.590 --> 53:12.590]  I love to party.
[53:12.590 --> 53:13.590]  Dude's got a mohawk and a beard.
[53:13.590 --> 53:14.590]  He's ready to get down.
[53:14.590 --> 53:17.590]  I love to party like once a month.
[53:17.590 --> 53:18.590]  And one painted toenail.
[53:18.590 --> 53:20.590]  I will tell you guys, he can't.
[53:20.590 --> 53:23.590]  He is not a dribbler.
[53:23.590 --> 53:28.590]  I want to do Instagram live and start at his toe and scroll up his leg to his face.
[53:28.590 --> 53:30.590]  So people are like, ooh, who's Jeff with?
[53:30.590 --> 53:31.590]  Do you guys want to see?
[53:31.590 --> 53:32.590]  Throw the hearts down.
[53:32.590 --> 53:36.590]  I wore this today with flip flops.
[53:36.590 --> 53:40.590]  You had a pink shirt on.
[53:41.590 --> 53:44.590]  On a plane from California.
[53:44.590 --> 53:45.590]  Oh, no, from Oklahoma.
[53:45.590 --> 53:46.590]  I thought you were coming from Cali.
[53:46.590 --> 53:47.590]  I was coming from Oklahoma.
[53:47.590 --> 53:48.590]  That's what made it funny.
[53:48.590 --> 53:52.590]  Did you ask the TSA agent for a lighter to light your joint?
[53:52.590 --> 53:53.590]  No, not this time.
[53:53.590 --> 53:55.590]  But see, that's how I like to party.
[53:55.590 --> 53:57.590]  That's how I'm wild and dangerous.
[53:57.590 --> 54:03.590]  I like airsoft and I like smoking weed in fucking public places.
[54:03.590 --> 54:04.590]  Sue me.
[54:04.590 --> 54:05.590]  Fucking sue me.
[54:05.590 --> 54:06.590]  Those are acceptable.
[54:06.590 --> 54:07.590]  I'm down.
[54:07.590 --> 54:08.590]  You're not hurting anybody.
[54:08.590 --> 54:09.590]  You're not causing any problems.
[54:09.590 --> 54:10.590]  I'm down.
[54:10.590 --> 54:11.590]  I don't drink.
[54:11.590 --> 54:12.590]  I'll play airsoft with you.
[54:12.590 --> 54:13.590]  You got to take one.
[54:13.590 --> 54:17.590]  I think I moved to Hollywood and everybody's like, kid, he's going to get strung out on heroin.
[54:17.590 --> 54:21.590]  I'm like, bro, I don't even take allergy pills.
[54:21.590 --> 54:22.590]  Did they really say that?
[54:22.590 --> 54:23.590]  No, they didn't.
[54:23.590 --> 54:27.590]  But everybody's seeing me out partying and stuff.
[54:27.590 --> 54:33.590]  And I think that I smoke a lot of weed.
[54:33.590 --> 54:34.590]  Let the guy have fun.
[54:34.590 --> 54:35.590]  You're a businessman.
[54:35.590 --> 54:36.590]  Come on.
[54:36.590 --> 54:38.590]  No, I am a businessman.
[54:38.590 --> 54:39.590]  I'm professional.
[54:39.590 --> 54:42.590]  But that was the message I got.
[54:42.590 --> 54:47.590]  I randomly got some message from some follower that was like, I heard you're some fucking junkie.
[54:47.590 --> 54:50.590]  I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about, bro?
[54:50.590 --> 54:52.590]  And that was the Mexican CBD.
[54:52.590 --> 54:54.590]  He's like, I know what Mexican CBD means.
[54:54.590 --> 54:58.590]  He's like, bro, we made a joke because people were snorting CBD.
[54:58.590 --> 55:07.590]  And we were like, oh, fucking, you know somebody out here has got some straight fucking cocaine, CBD mix, personal shit that they're snorting.
[55:07.590 --> 55:12.590]  And we were like, yeah, fucking Mexican CBD, you know what I'm saying, that strong shit.
[55:12.590 --> 55:28.590]  And it became this standing joke that whenever you're at one of these fucking weed parties, there's somebody there that's going to justifiably, you always get that one guy that tries to justifiably talk about some other drug.
[55:28.590 --> 55:30.590]  I just do it because of this, bro, just once in a while.
[55:30.590 --> 55:35.590]  Oh, no, now it's a...
[55:36.590 --> 55:38.590]  Now you guys all know what the Mexican CBD is.
[55:38.590 --> 55:39.590]  It's mushrooms now.
[55:39.590 --> 55:40.590]  No one on the joke.
[55:40.590 --> 55:43.590]  Hey, today's headline in Denver.
[55:43.590 --> 55:48.590]  Colorado is working to legalize mushrooms for medicinal purposes.
[55:48.590 --> 55:50.590]  I actually do use mushrooms.
[55:50.590 --> 55:53.590]  Because I've said what drugs I don't do.
[55:53.590 --> 55:55.590]  I'll say what drugs I do do.
[55:55.590 --> 55:56.590]  There's nothing wrong with mushrooms.
[55:56.590 --> 55:57.590]  I love mushrooms.
[55:57.590 --> 55:59.590]  All the stuff that comes out of the earth.
[55:59.590 --> 56:01.590]  Again, in moderation.
[56:01.590 --> 56:03.590]  In moderation and in safe environment.
[56:03.590 --> 56:04.590]  I think they're extremely...
[56:04.590 --> 56:11.590]  I think they show a lot of promise in depression and social anxiety issues, stuff like that.
[56:11.590 --> 56:15.590]  Read at least one Terrence McKenna book before you venture into the world of mushrooms.
[56:15.590 --> 56:22.590]  I've had nothing but pleasant, you know, psycho, fucking out there experiences.
[56:22.590 --> 56:27.590]  I like to recharge the spiritual battery just as much as the next shmuck walking down the street.
[56:27.590 --> 56:28.590]  Refresh, wash it out.
[56:28.590 --> 56:29.590]  Wash it out.
[56:29.590 --> 56:31.590]  What's a spiritual dose for Giddy?
[56:31.590 --> 56:32.590]  A lot.
[56:32.590 --> 56:33.590]  A lot.
[56:33.590 --> 56:34.590]  No hesitation.
[56:34.590 --> 56:35.590]  A lot.
[56:35.590 --> 56:36.590]  Too much.
[56:36.590 --> 56:38.590]  Probably more than I should talk about in the show.
[56:38.590 --> 56:39.590]  No.
[56:39.590 --> 56:40.590]  No.
[56:40.590 --> 56:45.590]  When I do find the need for those, and I can tell...
[56:45.590 --> 56:47.590]  I'm not a religious man.
[56:47.590 --> 56:53.590]  I like to consider myself a relatively spiritual man.
[56:53.590 --> 56:57.590]  In the sense that I try to flow with the universe.
[56:57.590 --> 57:00.590]  I try to go and I try to be aware of my surroundings.
[57:00.590 --> 57:08.590]  When I feel like I need to get back to the part of my brain that I shut away day after day when I go to work,
[57:08.590 --> 57:10.590]  that I lock in the back of my mind,
[57:10.590 --> 57:16.590]  that the creative thoughts that flow and sit.
[57:16.590 --> 57:20.590]  I smoke weed to fucking deal with stress and I enjoy taste.
[57:20.590 --> 57:24.590]  I feel better smoking weed.
[57:24.590 --> 57:28.590]  But that's to numb the pain.
[57:28.590 --> 57:34.590]  I do hallucinogens to look the pain in the eye and see what's going on.
[57:34.590 --> 57:39.590]  I don't know about y'all, but every time I get done, I kind of know what I need to do with my life at that point.
[57:39.590 --> 57:43.590]  I be real with myself when I do it.
[57:43.590 --> 57:46.590]  I'm very introspective when I do hallucinogens.
[57:46.590 --> 57:49.590]  I don't like to do them at parties or nothing like that.
[57:49.590 --> 57:50.590]  Exactly.
[57:50.590 --> 57:52.590]  By yourself, by the campfire.
[57:52.590 --> 57:53.590]  Just think it out.
[57:53.590 --> 57:54.590]  Totally by the campfire.
[57:54.590 --> 57:57.590]  So you're a three gram, five gram, seven gram kind of guy?
[57:57.590 --> 57:58.590]  Seven gram.
[57:58.590 --> 57:59.590]  All right.
[57:59.590 --> 58:00.590]  There you go.
[58:00.590 --> 58:01.590]  That's how you do it.
[58:01.590 --> 58:02.590]  This dude's over here shaking his head.
[58:02.590 --> 58:05.590]  Is that just getting started or is that blowing you out of the water?
[58:05.590 --> 58:06.590]  I'm too old for that shit.
[58:06.590 --> 58:07.590]  He said, I'm too old for that shit.
[58:07.590 --> 58:10.590]  That's everybody who wants to remain anonymous on the podcast over there.
[58:10.590 --> 58:11.590]  He's too old.
[58:11.590 --> 58:13.590]  We got another I'm too old for that shit.
[58:13.590 --> 58:14.590]  We got a couple I'm too old.
[58:14.590 --> 58:16.590]  We got one guy rubbing his beard like I'm staying out of this.
[58:16.590 --> 58:18.590]  And I'm probably older than all of them.
[58:18.590 --> 58:20.590]  He doesn't like them.
[58:20.590 --> 58:21.590]  I love them.
[58:21.590 --> 58:24.590]  Sounds like Kevin enjoyed himself the last time.
[58:24.590 --> 58:26.590]  I think I saw some Instagram videos.
[58:26.590 --> 58:27.590]  Yes, we were.
[58:27.590 --> 58:29.590]  You eating them all day long?
[58:31.590 --> 58:32.590]  Nothing?
[58:32.590 --> 58:33.590]  I'm lost.
[58:35.590 --> 58:37.590]  Well, we're not going to incriminate anybody.
[58:37.590 --> 58:38.590]  Oh, yeah.
[58:38.590 --> 58:39.590]  That has to come out.
[58:39.590 --> 58:42.590]  Man, the auras were wonderful that day.
[58:42.590 --> 58:48.590]  I totally think that with my experience in the past with it,
[58:49.590 --> 58:55.590]  it should absolutely be thought of as a type of therapy for a lot of people,
[58:55.590 --> 58:57.590]  especially people who don't produce dopamine,
[58:57.590 --> 59:00.590]  which are like a lot of TBI people.
[59:00.590 --> 59:04.590]  Because of our long-running war,
[59:04.590 --> 59:08.590]  we have a lot of TBI survivors that also have PTSD,
[59:08.590 --> 59:11.590]  and that really works for kind of both of those.
[59:11.590 --> 59:17.590]  And I see in the headlines a lot that that is like something
[59:17.590 --> 59:20.590]  that they're trying to at least get some attention on.
[59:20.590 --> 59:25.590]  And I think because of Colorado, we have a huge military population.
[59:25.590 --> 59:26.590]  Yes, we do.
[59:26.590 --> 59:27.590]  That's right.
[59:27.590 --> 59:31.590]  We have a lot of veterans here that have been through those wars.
[59:31.590 --> 59:32.590]  Yeah.
[59:32.590 --> 59:36.590]  So I think maybe that has something to do with why they're looking into it here.
[59:38.590 --> 59:39.590]  Well, I mean, it makes sense.
[59:39.590 --> 59:44.590]  I think that the large population really has a lot of the VA here.
[59:45.590 --> 59:50.590]  And now I think honestly with the pressure that they've had on them
[59:50.590 --> 59:54.590]  from our soldiers coming home,
[59:54.590 --> 59:59.590]  that the VA, their MO is kind of like Medicaid the problem.
[59:59.590 --> 01:00:00.590]  Yeah, heavily.
[01:00:00.590 --> 01:00:01.590]  Heavily.
[01:00:01.590 --> 01:00:07.590]  I think their pressure for marijuana has got the same people showing up,
[01:00:07.590 --> 01:00:10.590]  saying there's other alternatives, not just marijuana,
[01:00:10.590 --> 01:00:17.590]  but LSD, mushrooms, therapeutic doses, microdosing mushrooms.
[01:00:17.590 --> 01:00:25.590]  I know a lot of people that microdose and say this changes everything about my day.
[01:00:25.590 --> 01:00:28.590]  I follow people on Instagram that do a journal every day,
[01:00:28.590 --> 01:00:30.590]  and they're like, I take this much, and this is how it's improving.
[01:00:30.590 --> 01:00:31.590]  That's right.
[01:00:31.590 --> 01:00:32.590]  I see it working for people.
[01:00:32.590 --> 01:00:35.590]  I think everything that's growing out of the earth was put here for a reason.
[01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:36.590]  Some of it will fucking kill you.
[01:00:36.590 --> 01:00:38.590]  Some of it at the right dose will cure you.
[01:00:39.590 --> 01:00:40.590]  The same thing.
[01:00:40.590 --> 01:00:42.590]  The wrong dose will just ruin you.
[01:00:42.590 --> 01:00:45.590]  I never encourage anybody to recklessly do anything.
[01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:48.590]  Never do anything that jeopardizes anything.
[01:00:48.590 --> 01:00:56.590]  I've always chose to do it in a safe environment when I do any kind of hallucinogens.
[01:00:56.590 --> 01:01:00.590]  I never would drive or have that.
[01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:02.590]  You'd be lucky to get me out of my bed.
[01:01:02.590 --> 01:01:06.590]  Well, if I had seven grams at once, I would not be driving.
[01:01:06.590 --> 01:01:07.590]  That's the way to do it.
[01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:08.590]  That's the way you get to see.
[01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:09.590]  I don't do seven grams at once.
[01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:11.590]  I like to microdose.
[01:01:11.590 --> 01:01:15.590]  There's a difference in a spiritual dose and a microdose.
[01:01:15.590 --> 01:01:16.590]  That's absolutely.
[01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:18.590]  If I'm going in, I'm going for that spiritual experience.
[01:01:18.590 --> 01:01:21.590]  I need to look in there and have the problem identified
[01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:24.590]  and then dance around in my head and then find a solution to that problem.
[01:01:24.590 --> 01:01:25.590]  It's epiphany juice, bro.
[01:01:25.590 --> 01:01:26.590]  Wake up the next day.
[01:01:26.590 --> 01:01:27.590]  It's straight up epiphany juice.
[01:01:27.590 --> 01:01:30.590]  There are other things that will take me to that realm much more quickly
[01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:33.590]  and reveal problems for me, but we'll talk about those on other episodes.
[01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:34.590]  Oh, boy.
[01:01:35.590 --> 01:01:37.590]  Got a little giggles throughout the room for the folks that have participated.
[01:01:37.590 --> 01:01:39.590]  I have DMT.
[01:01:39.590 --> 01:01:40.590]  That's exactly.
[01:01:40.590 --> 01:01:42.590]  Dwayne's never done DMT over there.
[01:01:42.590 --> 01:01:43.590]  I've never done DMT.
[01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:46.590]  We'll have to open your brain one day, show you what's wrong.
[01:01:46.590 --> 01:01:50.590]  You know what turned me off about DMT?
[01:01:50.590 --> 01:01:51.590]  The taste?
[01:01:51.590 --> 01:01:52.590]  No, I've never done it.
[01:01:52.590 --> 01:01:53.590]  You should put some terps on it.
[01:01:53.590 --> 01:01:54.590]  I've never done it.
[01:01:54.590 --> 01:01:55.590]  I've never done it.
[01:01:55.590 --> 01:01:57.590]  Smoke DMT through a Hellstone pipe with terps on it?
[01:01:57.590 --> 01:01:58.590]  Wow.
[01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:00.590]  Everybody just looked at me like I was a genius.
[01:02:00.590 --> 01:02:02.590]  The Hellstone pipe is the way to go.
[01:02:02.590 --> 01:02:03.590]  I've never had that thought before.
[01:02:03.590 --> 01:02:06.590]  No, the Hellstone pipe is the way to go, but the terps on top,
[01:02:06.590 --> 01:02:08.590]  that would just bully your mind.
[01:02:08.590 --> 01:02:12.590]  I'll tell you what, I watched somebody who won't be named who won a cannabis cup.
[01:02:12.590 --> 01:02:18.590]  Actually, a special shout-out to the crew of Team Elite Genetics,
[01:02:18.590 --> 01:02:20.590]  my boys Kyne, Bill, Rye, and me.
[01:02:20.590 --> 01:02:24.590]  Won another cup up in NorCal this last year.
[01:02:24.590 --> 01:02:25.590]  Congratulations.
[01:02:25.590 --> 01:02:26.590]  Thank you.
[01:02:26.590 --> 01:02:29.590]  Rounding them up, six for me now.
[01:02:29.590 --> 01:02:30.590]  Getting heavy.
[01:02:30.590 --> 01:02:32.590]  Congratulations.
[01:02:32.590 --> 01:02:33.590]  Getting a little heavy.
[01:02:33.590 --> 01:02:34.590]  Yeah.
[01:02:34.590 --> 01:02:37.590]  I think that's the last three.
[01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:41.590]  I didn't even know they entered the product until we had won.
[01:02:41.590 --> 01:02:42.590]  So I was like, oh, sweet.
[01:02:42.590 --> 01:02:46.590]  I got a phone call when I was air-softing that we won down in SoCal
[01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:48.590]  on the product that we ran for them.
[01:02:48.590 --> 01:02:51.590]  He's got a great product.
[01:02:51.590 --> 01:02:52.590]  I was going somewhere.
[01:02:52.590 --> 01:02:53.590]  I was somebody at the cup.
[01:02:53.590 --> 01:02:54.590]  Why you will not do DMT?
[01:02:54.590 --> 01:02:58.590]  Somebody at the cup, like I watched somebody hit a big old hit of DMT
[01:02:58.590 --> 01:03:00.590]  and then go up and accept their award on stage.
[01:03:01.590 --> 01:03:02.590]  It just kind of blew my mind.
[01:03:02.590 --> 01:03:03.590]  No.
[01:03:03.590 --> 01:03:04.590]  No.
[01:03:04.590 --> 01:03:05.590]  Yeah.
[01:03:05.590 --> 01:03:08.590]  And y'all all know him too, so don't get too.
[01:03:10.590 --> 01:03:12.590]  And he wasn't slobbering all over himself?
[01:03:12.590 --> 01:03:14.590]  No, no, he wasn't.
[01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:16.590]  Nobody in the world would have known.
[01:03:16.590 --> 01:03:18.590]  He was a total like, he didn't.
[01:03:18.590 --> 01:03:20.590]  I just totally witnessed it happen.
[01:03:20.590 --> 01:03:23.590]  I don't know how much of this I want to say, but DMT is a three-puff drug.
[01:03:23.590 --> 01:03:26.590]  Hit number one, the paper starts crinkling.
[01:03:26.590 --> 01:03:28.590]  Hit number two, the paper tears.
[01:03:28.590 --> 01:03:30.590]  Hit number three, you're fucking in there.
[01:03:30.590 --> 01:03:33.590]  And then about 15 minutes later, everything is just, you're like,
[01:03:33.590 --> 01:03:35.590]  whoa, what the fuck?
[01:03:35.590 --> 01:03:38.590]  Whoa, I'm not floating in gelatin or something anymore.
[01:03:38.590 --> 01:03:39.590]  I'm normal again.
[01:03:39.590 --> 01:03:44.590]  But that first one I could see maybe functioning off one light puff.
[01:03:44.590 --> 01:03:47.590]  But two, you start getting somewhere.
[01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:48.590]  And three, you're done.
[01:03:48.590 --> 01:03:49.590]  Three years scraping the moon.
[01:03:49.590 --> 01:03:50.590]  Scraping the moon.
[01:03:50.590 --> 01:03:52.590]  All these great analogies.
[01:03:52.590 --> 01:03:56.590]  Now listen, these are great analogies,
[01:03:56.590 --> 01:03:58.590]  but somebody once told me,
[01:03:58.590 --> 01:04:01.590]  I think it was a Joe Rogan podcast that I heard,
[01:04:01.590 --> 01:04:08.590]  and he said, doing DMT is like having your computer desktop.
[01:04:08.590 --> 01:04:14.590]  And it's like doing DMT takes all the files on your desktop
[01:04:14.590 --> 01:04:21.590]  and shrinks them down into one file that was labeled, my old shit.
[01:04:21.590 --> 01:04:22.590]  Yeah.
[01:04:22.590 --> 01:04:25.590]  And I have-
[01:04:25.590 --> 01:04:27.590]  That's a real good analogy.
[01:04:27.590 --> 01:04:30.590]  I have way too many motherfucking responsibilities
[01:04:30.590 --> 01:04:33.590]  to not give a fuck about them.
[01:04:33.590 --> 01:04:38.590]  I'm scared to death that I'm going to do DMT and go-
[01:04:38.590 --> 01:04:40.590]  It doesn't do that to you.
[01:04:40.590 --> 01:04:41.590]  It doesn't do that.
[01:04:41.590 --> 01:04:43.590]  You already know, Pimpin.
[01:04:43.590 --> 01:04:44.590]  You already know.
[01:04:44.590 --> 01:04:46.590]  I've never talked about this on the pod.
[01:04:46.590 --> 01:04:48.590]  I've never gone this route on the show.
[01:04:48.590 --> 01:04:51.590]  Now you smoke DMT and you know it's over, bro.
[01:04:51.590 --> 01:04:52.590]  What was you thinking?
[01:04:52.590 --> 01:04:54.590]  You went so many years without going,
[01:04:54.590 --> 01:04:57.590]  hey, do it because it's going to ruin your life.
[01:04:57.590 --> 01:04:58.590]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:04:58.590 --> 01:04:59.590]  And that's the problem.
[01:04:59.590 --> 01:05:01.590]  It won't ruin my life, but it will change it drastically.
[01:05:01.590 --> 01:05:04.590]  It will change your thought process.
[01:05:04.590 --> 01:05:06.590]  And not as drastically as you're going to think.
[01:05:06.590 --> 01:05:07.590]  And it's very-
[01:05:07.590 --> 01:05:10.590]  I haven't done a psychedelic drug since my traumatic brain injury.
[01:05:10.590 --> 01:05:12.590]  I had a severe traumatic brain injury,
[01:05:12.590 --> 01:05:15.590]  and for a little while I heard a humming noise that would not go away,
[01:05:15.590 --> 01:05:17.590]  and it was terrible, and that noise is gone.
[01:05:17.590 --> 01:05:21.590]  And I'm afraid that if I do any drugs, it's going to come back.
[01:05:21.590 --> 01:05:23.590]  And if it comes back, I don't know how I'm going to handle it,
[01:05:23.590 --> 01:05:24.590]  especially if I'm tripping or something.
[01:05:24.590 --> 01:05:25.590]  So I'm afraid.
[01:05:25.590 --> 01:05:29.590]  But before then, it would not be rare to find me doing a blast of DMT.
[01:05:29.590 --> 01:05:32.590]  What I felt like it would do-
[01:05:32.590 --> 01:05:36.590]  I describe them as the Mooninites from Occoteen Hunger Force,
[01:05:36.590 --> 01:05:37.590]  those little square guys.
[01:05:37.590 --> 01:05:39.590]  Yeah, those little guys.
[01:05:39.590 --> 01:05:40.590]  You take a blast of DMT.
[01:05:40.590 --> 01:05:42.590]  Give us your microphone.
[01:05:42.590 --> 01:05:43.590]  You fall back into the chair,
[01:05:43.590 --> 01:05:45.590]  and those little guys danced around in front of me,
[01:05:45.590 --> 01:05:48.590]  and all they said was, hey, it's okay.
[01:05:48.590 --> 01:05:50.590]  And they just kept rubbing me on my knee and on my shoulder,
[01:05:50.590 --> 01:05:52.590]  and they'd go, it's okay, bro.
[01:05:52.590 --> 01:05:54.590]  And you start thinking about all the-
[01:05:54.590 --> 01:05:55.590]  well, what could they mean?
[01:05:55.590 --> 01:05:57.590]  And that triggers you to go, well, what could they mean?
[01:05:57.590 --> 01:05:59.590]  And then you remember, well, that happened when I was a kid.
[01:05:59.590 --> 01:06:00.590]  Fuck.
[01:06:00.590 --> 01:06:01.590]  And then you go, oh, well, that's okay.
[01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:02.590]  I guess it's okay.
[01:06:02.590 --> 01:06:04.590]  And you start remembering all this dumb shit that you've suppressed
[01:06:04.590 --> 01:06:07.590]  or that you're dealing with or whatever.
[01:06:07.590 --> 01:06:09.590]  Dumb shit, trivial shit that shouldn't even be bugging you.
[01:06:09.590 --> 01:06:11.590]  It pops up in your head vividly.
[01:06:11.590 --> 01:06:14.590]  It's got spotlights on it, but you can rotate it at every direction.
[01:06:14.590 --> 01:06:16.590]  You can look at it from the bottom.
[01:06:16.590 --> 01:06:18.590]  You can look at it from the side, and you've stepped back,
[01:06:18.590 --> 01:06:20.590]  and you can pivot it all around.
[01:06:20.590 --> 01:06:23.590]  And then those little guys, they go, hey, bro, did you ever think of this?
[01:06:23.590 --> 01:06:26.590]  Maybe you're just clinging to some stupid shit.
[01:06:26.590 --> 01:06:27.590]  It's okay.
[01:06:27.590 --> 01:06:30.590]  And then you come out of it, and you go, oh, it's okay.
[01:06:30.590 --> 01:06:31.590]  Damn, it's okay.
[01:06:31.590 --> 01:06:35.590]  It's like cleaning your stupid shit filter is kind of what it does.
[01:06:35.590 --> 01:06:36.590]  It's a good way to get past-
[01:06:36.590 --> 01:06:38.590]  like if you're stuck on something, if something happened,
[01:06:38.590 --> 01:06:41.590]  and you've got a thing in your brain, you're like, why this?
[01:06:41.590 --> 01:06:43.590]  Why? Or a fucking how or whatever.
[01:06:43.590 --> 01:06:46.590]  Smoke some DMT and put that in your mind, and you'll know why or how.
[01:06:46.590 --> 01:06:48.590]  I've got to go to work on Monday.
[01:06:48.590 --> 01:06:49.590]  You'll realize what I'm looking at.
[01:06:49.590 --> 01:06:53.590]  Yeah, but DMT is like a 15, 30 minute- 30 minutes at the most,
[01:06:53.590 --> 01:06:57.590]  and you're like, oh, I was so fucked up 30 minutes ago, I can't believe it.
[01:06:57.590 --> 01:07:01.590]  When I retire, I'm going to become that old hippie guy.
[01:07:01.590 --> 01:07:02.590]  Yes, you will.
[01:07:02.590 --> 01:07:03.590]  There are people that can't believe-
[01:07:03.590 --> 01:07:05.590]  I am living proof of that.
[01:07:05.590 --> 01:07:08.590]  When you retire, you can do whatever you damn well please.
[01:07:08.590 --> 01:07:09.590]  I love it.
[01:07:09.590 --> 01:07:11.590]  I watch Granny on Instagram, and it makes me fucking envious.
[01:07:12.590 --> 01:07:14.590]  Yeah, microphone voice, brother, microphone voice.
[01:07:14.590 --> 01:07:16.590]  I'm hella jelly watching her sometimes.
[01:07:16.590 --> 01:07:17.590]  I'm like, she's living life.
[01:07:17.590 --> 01:07:18.590]  I love it.
[01:07:18.590 --> 01:07:20.590]  People talk shit to her about shouldn't she be doing something.
[01:07:20.590 --> 01:07:22.590]  It's like church. Granny's like church around my house.
[01:07:22.590 --> 01:07:23.590]  She really is.
[01:07:23.590 --> 01:07:24.590]  She did.
[01:07:24.590 --> 01:07:25.590]  Me and my girl wake up in the morning.
[01:07:25.590 --> 01:07:27.590]  Her kids are raised. She's fucking got her thing.
[01:07:27.590 --> 01:07:30.590]  I have a great husband that supports me.
[01:07:30.590 --> 01:07:33.590]  Yeah, you're watching her on Instagram, motherfucker.
[01:07:33.590 --> 01:07:35.590]  Get off the couch and do something with your life.
[01:07:35.590 --> 01:07:36.590]  I start my mornings with Granny.
[01:07:36.590 --> 01:07:38.590]  We do. That's our wake and bake.
[01:07:38.590 --> 01:07:41.590]  I wake up. Gabby's usually made me coffee.
[01:07:41.590 --> 01:07:45.590]  On days when Gabby don't have to wake up early,
[01:07:45.590 --> 01:07:47.590]  we'll lay in bed in the morning and watch.
[01:07:47.590 --> 01:07:50.590]  If I don't go live with her, it's because I'm laying in bed with Gabby.
[01:07:50.590 --> 01:07:51.590]  We're just watching.
[01:07:51.590 --> 01:07:53.590]  Well, this morning they were like, where's Giddy?
[01:07:53.590 --> 01:07:55.590]  I said, oh, I got to go.
[01:07:55.590 --> 01:07:58.590]  Giddy up could come, and I wouldn't even have him come live with me,
[01:07:58.590 --> 01:07:59.590]  so don't even ask.
[01:07:59.590 --> 01:08:00.590]  You didn't say that.
[01:08:00.590 --> 01:08:01.590]  Yes, I did.
[01:08:01.590 --> 01:08:02.590]  You didn't say that.
[01:08:02.590 --> 01:08:03.590]  Yes.
[01:08:03.590 --> 01:08:06.590]  I'll burn this whole fucking place down.
[01:08:06.590 --> 01:08:07.590]  Don't burn this place down.
[01:08:07.590 --> 01:08:09.590]  I'm going to tell you guys.
[01:08:09.590 --> 01:08:11.590]  Can I pack up my gear first?
[01:08:11.590 --> 01:08:14.590]  I go on live the other day, and they were like,
[01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:19.590]  all the followers are going, Granny, you missed it.
[01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:20.590]  What did I miss?
[01:08:20.590 --> 01:08:22.590]  Giddy was live from the shower.
[01:08:22.590 --> 01:08:24.590]  You missed it, Granny.
[01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:26.590]  Giddy up was live in the shower.
[01:08:26.590 --> 01:08:29.590]  I've got a waterproof phone now and a firm grip,
[01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:32.590]  and I'll let you get in on the shower.
[01:08:32.590 --> 01:08:34.590]  Just follow my private Snapchat.
[01:08:34.590 --> 01:08:39.590]  Do you get a bunch of lovely female followers after you go live with Granny?
[01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:41.590]  I've told her this before.
[01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:44.590]  I saw my analytics one day.
[01:08:44.590 --> 01:08:48.590]  I have like 65% female followers.
[01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:49.590]  No way.
[01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:50.590]  It's fucking crazy.
[01:08:50.590 --> 01:08:51.590]  Call it shenanigans.
[01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:52.590]  My feed's a sausage fest, bro.
[01:08:52.590 --> 01:08:53.590]  Mine's like 80%.
[01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:54.590]  Mine is too.
[01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:56.590]  That's why I'm like shenanigans.
[01:08:56.590 --> 01:08:58.590]  Go look at my followers.
[01:08:58.590 --> 01:08:59.590]  It's crazy.
[01:08:59.590 --> 01:09:00.590]  It's crazy.
[01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:05.590]  Granny, I mean, when you see me go live and my followers, it's majority.
[01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:07.590]  Every dude in Denver.
[01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:08.590]  It's a facial scrubber.
[01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:09.590]  What do you do to that?
[01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:10.590]  What do I do, man?
[01:09:10.590 --> 01:09:11.590]  I got black girl magic, bro.
[01:09:11.590 --> 01:09:14.590]  My girlfriend oils me up.
[01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:15.590]  Is that cocoa butter?
[01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:19.590]  I've never dropped the mic for somebody else before.
[01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:21.590]  I got black girl magic, bro.
[01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:22.590]  That's just magical.
[01:09:22.590 --> 01:09:24.590]  It's doing wonders, dude.
[01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:25.590]  You're glowing, bro.
[01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:26.590]  My girl Gabby makes it.
[01:09:26.590 --> 01:09:28.590]  The mohawk, the beard, the glowing skin.
[01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:31.590]  She makes her own essential oil mix.
[01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:34.590]  She hits me up with like rose oil.
[01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:35.590]  Rose oil?
[01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:37.590]  Yeah, rose oil.
[01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:40.590]  I can't be giving like shit I like.
[01:09:40.590 --> 01:09:42.590]  I'll be doing it.
[01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:43.590]  I'll look gorgeous.
[01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:44.590]  But I'll tell you this.
[01:09:44.590 --> 01:09:46.590]  I'll tell you this.
[01:09:46.590 --> 01:09:51.590]  I am at heart a scientist.
[01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:53.590]  If I may not be one in degree or education.
[01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:55.590]  A beauty scientist.
[01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:57.590]  But thieves oil, man.
[01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:59.590]  Thieves oil.
[01:09:59.590 --> 01:10:01.590]  What you know about thieves oil?
[01:10:01.590 --> 01:10:02.590]  Thieves?
[01:10:02.590 --> 01:10:04.590]  I usually don't fuck with them thieves.
[01:10:04.590 --> 01:10:05.590]  I don't fuck with thieves.
[01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:06.590]  Do your research.
[01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:10.590]  I'd like to take a second to plug in my private premium Snapchat.
[01:10:10.590 --> 01:10:12.590]  If you guys want to check it out.
[01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:13.590]  Check it out.
[01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:14.590]  It's fucking worth it.
[01:10:14.590 --> 01:10:16.590]  Do you accept Venmo or PayPal?
[01:10:16.590 --> 01:10:17.590]  This guy's got that.
[01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:20.590]  If you're into man bods and beards and turps, he's the way to go.
[01:10:20.590 --> 01:10:24.590]  I was teasing somebody that was making a joke.
[01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:30.590]  Somebody on Instagram that I follow was making a joke about follow my premium Snapchat.
[01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:32.590]  And I sent them.
[01:10:32.590 --> 01:10:34.590]  I went hmm.
[01:10:34.590 --> 01:10:39.590]  And I sent them like a face emoji that was like, you know.
[01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:41.590]  Skeptical hippo face.
[01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:43.590]  Yeah, skeptical emoji face.
[01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:45.590]  And.
[01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:48.590]  You're high, bro?
[01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:50.590]  She was like, don't judge.
[01:10:50.590 --> 01:10:52.590]  I was like, I'm not judging.
[01:10:52.590 --> 01:10:54.590]  Decide which credit card to use.
[01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:56.590]  That's such a funny thing.
[01:10:56.590 --> 01:11:01.590]  The sex worker business is actually, that's the one that's the most premium.
[01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:07.590]  I've never, I've personally never paid for a premium Snapchat or anything like that.
[01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:09.590]  Who's going to pay for premium Snapchat, bro?
[01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:11.590]  Do people pay for that?
[01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:12.590]  Yes, they do.
[01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:13.590]  People pay for it.
[01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:18.590]  There was a whole documentary deal they had about where they were talking about they use Bitcoin and shit, bro.
[01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:22.590]  Chicks be making mad money, bro.
[01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:24.590]  Yes, they do.
[01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:26.590]  Is it twist?
[01:11:26.590 --> 01:11:28.590]  No.
[01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:32.590]  Chances are, bro, if your phone is ringing, it's twist.
[01:11:32.590 --> 01:11:35.590]  No, my phone just got turned back on.
[01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:36.590]  But you know what?
[01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:37.590]  I think that's a twisty seed.
[01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:39.590]  Keep the sex out of the cannabis.
[01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:41.590]  You know how I feel about that.
[01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:43.590]  I'm not even about premium Snapchats.
[01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:47.590]  I'm pretty, I'm joking about it when I say you're joking about it, right?
[01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:48.590]  We all are joking about it.
[01:11:48.590 --> 01:11:51.590]  No, make sure you follow TNT's page.
[01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:52.590]  No.
[01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:56.590]  They sat down my back page, man, so I got to get it where I can get it, bro.
[01:11:56.590 --> 01:11:58.590]  I'm late night premium snaps, bro.
[01:11:58.590 --> 01:12:01.590]  I've long said put your clothes back on and weed.
[01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:05.590]  And because it's a medicine, recreational weed, I guess, you know, do what you want.
[01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:10.590]  I guess sex sells, but it's never been the way I've thought to market my shit.
[01:12:10.590 --> 01:12:13.590]  If you've got a good cannabis product, the Terps will sell themselves.
[01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:14.590]  You don't need to put titties on it.
[01:12:14.590 --> 01:12:15.590]  That's it.
[01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:16.590]  Yeah, Terps will sell.
[01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:17.590]  And classy, man.
[01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:18.590]  Like, come on, y'all.
[01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:22.590]  A little goes a long way, you know, like professionalize it.
[01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:23.590]  Professionalize it.
[01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:24.590]  Spell shit right.
[01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:25.590]  Spell shit correctly.
[01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:27.590]  Write in a complete sentence also.
[01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:29.590]  I don't know about all that, bro.
[01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:30.590]  I'm from Oklahoma.
[01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:33.590]  I'm not necessarily required to be grammatically correct.
[01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:36.590]  The young lady that let us in, I won't say her name because I don't know if she wants to be on the show.
[01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:39.590]  Let her, hire her to spell things correctly for you.
[01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:40.590]  She does do that.
[01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:41.590]  I know, I know.
[01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:42.590]  She is awesome.
[01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:43.590]  She does everything.
[01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:44.590]  She's a great hostess.
[01:12:44.590 --> 01:12:45.590]  She's super polite.
[01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:46.590]  I'm glad she was able to let us in.
[01:12:46.590 --> 01:12:47.590]  I love her.
[01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:50.590]  I love my staff and my partners and stuff.
[01:12:50.590 --> 01:12:51.590]  Dude, you've got a great building here.
[01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:54.590]  I know we bullshit a lot, but this is a pretty dope facility.
[01:12:54.590 --> 01:12:55.590]  You've got some comfy couches.
[01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:57.590]  There's 10 of us hanging out taking pictures.
[01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:59.590]  He surrounds himself with smart women.
[01:12:59.590 --> 01:13:01.590]  That's what he does so well.
[01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:03.590]  I've noticed from the show.
[01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:08.590]  I surround myself, oh, yes, yes.
[01:13:08.590 --> 01:13:13.590]  I surround myself with very smart, determined, strong women.
[01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:14.590]  There you go, guys.
[01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:17.590]  If we're going to take one lesson from this podcast, surround yourself with beautiful, smart women.
[01:13:17.590 --> 01:13:25.590]  If it's women in your life, if it's your mom, if it's your dad and granny, if it's your cannabis plants, if it's your daughter, smart, beautiful women in your life.
[01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:26.590]  Surround yourself and learn from them.
[01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:27.590]  Treat them right.
[01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:28.590]  Do what you can do.
[01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:29.590]  You guys, it's getting kind of late.
[01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:30.590]  We should wrap up the show.
[01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:34.590]  A few of us have quite a drive to get back to our domiciles for the evening.
[01:13:34.590 --> 01:13:35.590]  That's right.
[01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:36.590]  I want to thank everybody for hanging out.
[01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:40.590]  Let's do a whole bunch of social media shout outs so that everybody knows how to find everybody.
[01:13:40.590 --> 01:13:41.590]  Of course, dad and granny.
[01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:43.590]  You know how to find me.
[01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:44.590]  I'm all over.
[01:13:44.590 --> 01:13:45.590]  She's on the block.
[01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:46.590]  She's all over the place.
[01:13:46.590 --> 01:13:47.590]  You can find her.
[01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:48.590]  Watch her Instagram live.
[01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:49.590]  She's going to be pimping me and Giddy out.
[01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:52.590]  Making that money, madam granny.
[01:13:52.590 --> 01:13:54.590]  The new dad and madam.
[01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:56.590]  Hey, Max, how can people find you on social media?
[01:13:56.590 --> 01:13:59.590]  TNT underscore extractions one.
[01:13:59.590 --> 01:14:00.590]  On the Instagram.
[01:14:00.590 --> 01:14:02.590]  He goes live occasionally.
[01:14:02.590 --> 01:14:03.590]  Check out his dope ass bird.
[01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:05.590]  That bird is cool as shit.
[01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:07.590]  Obviously, Giddy, how can we find you?
[01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:10.590]  I am official Giddy up on Instagram.
[01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:12.590]  That's usually my platform for play.
[01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:14.590]  When are you going to get verified, bro?
[01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:17.590]  I was asking a couple of my verified friends the other day.
[01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:22.590]  I was part of that group that got hacked and extorted.
[01:14:22.590 --> 01:14:24.590]  That's another episode, bro.
[01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:25.590]  We're going to have to hear about that.
[01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:26.590]  On Instagram?
[01:14:26.590 --> 01:14:28.590]  You didn't know about that?
[01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:30.590]  You remember that.
[01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:31.590]  You better remember that.
[01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:33.590]  Yeah, I was deleted as well.
[01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:34.590]  You were too, right?
[01:14:34.590 --> 01:14:35.590]  Were you extorted?
[01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:36.590]  No.
[01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:37.590]  You weren't?
[01:14:38.590 --> 01:14:40.590]  They asked me for money.
[01:14:40.590 --> 01:14:41.590]  You didn't pay?
[01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:42.590]  I paid.
[01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:43.590]  You paid?
[01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:44.590]  I paid.
[01:14:44.590 --> 01:14:45.590]  Did you get it back and then get it taken away again?
[01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:46.590]  Yeah.
[01:14:46.590 --> 01:14:47.590]  That's what happened to everybody.
[01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:49.590]  Yeah, I had an account disappear.
[01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:51.590]  Nobody ever hit me up for money, though.
[01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:54.590]  It got traced back because I got hit by the same.
[01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:55.590]  They told everyone that was in the know.
[01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:57.590]  I didn't know either, but everyone that was like,
[01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:59.590]  if you got your account got, you got to hit up
[01:14:59.590 --> 01:15:00.590]  blank and blank to get it back.
[01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:02.590]  I think I saw those posts.
[01:15:02.590 --> 01:15:04.590]  It wasn't just me.
[01:15:04.590 --> 01:15:05.590]  I lost all the trolls.
[01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:06.590]  Fuck them.
[01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:07.590]  I got feelers.
[01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:08.590]  I got feelers.
[01:15:08.590 --> 01:15:11.590]  There was a big group message with a lot of
[01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:13.590]  cannabis business owners in it.
[01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:16.590]  There was 11 of us in this group.
[01:15:16.590 --> 01:15:20.590]  Eight of the motherfuckers in the group
[01:15:20.590 --> 01:15:22.590]  were real players.
[01:15:22.590 --> 01:15:26.590]  This had affected their shit to where they saw
[01:15:26.590 --> 01:15:28.590]  when their shit went down for a month,
[01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:30.590]  it got taken away, they ran the numbers on it.
[01:15:30.590 --> 01:15:32.590]  They were looking to pay.
[01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:34.590]  They were looking for any solution.
[01:15:34.590 --> 01:15:36.590]  Just from losing their Instagram account?
[01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:37.590]  Oh, yeah.
[01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:38.590]  Yeah.
[01:15:38.590 --> 01:15:40.590]  My dude literally straight said,
[01:15:40.590 --> 01:15:41.590]  I can't stress to you enough.
[01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:44.590]  He's like, I can see a literal dollar amount
[01:15:44.590 --> 01:15:47.590]  of when they take my stuff down and I can't run
[01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:50.590]  my specials through my social media on my Instagram.
[01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:54.590]  They hired lawyers.
[01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:56.590]  They hired lawyers.
[01:15:56.590 --> 01:15:58.590]  They went through all this stuff.
[01:15:58.590 --> 01:16:03.590]  It turned out to be a Facebook employee.
[01:16:04.590 --> 01:16:05.590]  Wow.
[01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:06.590]  Yeah.
[01:16:06.590 --> 01:16:08.590]  That person was fired.
[01:16:08.590 --> 01:16:11.590]  Instagram is owned by Facebook.
[01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:12.590]  Instagram is owned by Facebook.
[01:16:12.590 --> 01:16:13.590]  FBI.
[01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:18.590]  We had all found out we had paid the same person.
[01:16:18.590 --> 01:16:22.590]  I'm not sure what happened over there.
[01:16:22.590 --> 01:16:24.590]  I know a lot of people got their shit back.
[01:16:24.590 --> 01:16:26.590]  I did not get my shit back.
[01:16:26.590 --> 01:16:30.590]  I lost my 20-some-odd thousand followers.
[01:16:31.590 --> 01:16:36.590]  After that, I didn't structure my Instagram the same way.
[01:16:36.590 --> 01:16:38.590]  I didn't do it the same way.
[01:16:38.590 --> 01:16:41.590]  It became way more informal to me because I was
[01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:44.590]  kind of just starting over and it didn't at the same time.
[01:16:44.590 --> 01:16:47.590]  Because back in the day, I'd show tech.
[01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:53.590]  I gave a lot of shit through my Instagram and now it's fun.
[01:16:53.590 --> 01:16:54.590]  Now it's just fun.
[01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:55.590]  Now I'm just hanging out on mine.
[01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:57.590]  I post more pictures of myself and my life
[01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:58.590]  and I feel like it's more fun.
[01:16:58.590 --> 01:17:00.590]  It's more interactive and I have more interaction
[01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:03.590]  with my followers instead of just here's a picture of a plant.
[01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:05.590]  I feel real close to my followers.
[01:17:05.590 --> 01:17:08.590]  I can see how Instagram could affect a large business.
[01:17:08.590 --> 01:17:09.590]  It would affect my business.
[01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:12.590]  I've got a very small business and it would affect my business hugely.
[01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:14.590]  Hugely, is that a word?
[01:17:14.590 --> 01:17:17.590]  If I can't advertise through Instagram, what do people do?
[01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:19.590]  First thing you do when you wake up, a lot of people,
[01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:21.590]  if you don't have somebody next to you, you wake up
[01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:22.590]  and you scroll through that Instagram.
[01:17:22.590 --> 01:17:23.590]  What's going on in the world?
[01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:24.590]  Who's doing what?
[01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:26.590]  And they see iReGenetics, Emotech.
[01:17:26.590 --> 01:17:27.590]  They see our posts.
[01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:28.590]  Now we're on their mind.
[01:17:28.590 --> 01:17:31.590]  If they don't have that, somebody else is on their mind in that spot.
[01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:35.590]  Well, not just that, but, you know, we're very restricted.
[01:17:35.590 --> 01:17:37.590]  Well, that's what's going on right now with YouTube.
[01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:41.590]  How many people lost their YouTube channels?
[01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:43.590]  Lost some of their YouTube channels down the drain.
[01:17:43.590 --> 01:17:44.590]  They gave them back.
[01:17:44.590 --> 01:17:46.590]  I got mine back.
[01:17:46.590 --> 01:17:47.590]  You got your YouTube back?
[01:17:47.590 --> 01:17:48.590]  Did Custom Girl get his back?
[01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:50.590]  Yes, Custom Girl 420 got his back.
[01:17:50.590 --> 01:17:51.590]  Nice.
[01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:52.590]  How about Coral Reafer?
[01:17:52.590 --> 01:17:54.590]  Did Coral Reafer get his back?
[01:17:54.590 --> 01:17:55.590]  I didn't check.
[01:17:55.590 --> 01:17:59.590]  My YouTube following is so small it never got shut down in the first place.
[01:17:59.590 --> 01:18:00.590]  I got, like, 250 YouTube followers,
[01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:02.590]  but big thank you to each and every single one of them.
[01:18:02.590 --> 01:18:04.590]  I love all of you individually.
[01:18:04.590 --> 01:18:06.590]  I don't know who my YouTube followers are.
[01:18:08.590 --> 01:18:10.590]  Max said my voice is so soothing.
[01:18:10.590 --> 01:18:11.590]  Thanks, Max.
[01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:13.590]  I'll follow your premium Snapchat if you listen to my podcast.
[01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:14.590]  I do listen to your podcast.
[01:18:14.590 --> 01:18:16.590]  I'll bring the Mexican CBD.
[01:18:16.590 --> 01:18:18.590]  Normally the first thing when I wake up in the morning.
[01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:19.590]  This is going to be on.
[01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:21.590]  Tint for tat.
[01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:23.590]  This is getting weird in here.
[01:18:23.590 --> 01:18:24.590]  It's getting super strange.
[01:18:24.590 --> 01:18:26.590]  We should start wrapping up the podcast.
[01:18:26.590 --> 01:18:27.590]  I said that a few minutes ago.
[01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:29.590]  I want to thank all these people for gathering.
[01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:32.590]  Thanks for bringing the tremendous turps, the rosin that changed my mind,
[01:18:32.590 --> 01:18:38.590]  the FDA lab-approved CBD, the turps, the flowers.
[01:18:38.590 --> 01:18:39.590]  This is a great place to hang out.
[01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:40.590]  CanTech Labs.
[01:18:40.590 --> 01:18:41.590]  CanTech Labs.
[01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:42.590]  Say it again. Advertise, bro.

[01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:52.590]  You can get the products that we were enjoying this evening.
[01:18:52.590 --> 01:18:54.590]  You can partake just like Colorado kids.

[01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:59.590]  If you want to talk to your plug about carrying TNT extractions,
[01:18:59.590 --> 01:19:03.590]  you should definitely hit up your plug and tell them that they should carry some TNT.
[01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:06.590]  I don't know anything about that gray market connection.
[01:19:06.590 --> 01:19:08.590]  What's a plug?
[01:19:08.590 --> 01:19:09.590]  I'm not even going to edit that, bro.
[01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:10.590]  You're going to be out there now.
[01:19:10.590 --> 01:19:12.590]  You're going to be out there on the streets.
[01:19:12.590 --> 01:19:14.590]  I read your blog, you get TNT.
[01:19:14.590 --> 01:19:15.590]  Black market activity.
[01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:17.590]  Do what you got to do as a grown adult.
[01:19:17.590 --> 01:19:18.590]  I love it.
[01:19:18.590 --> 01:19:21.590]  Coral Reefers still banned on YouTube.
[01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:22.590]  Coral Reefers still banned.
[01:19:22.590 --> 01:19:23.590]  Shout out to Coral Reefers.
[01:19:23.590 --> 01:19:25.590]  She has her other channel on Vogue.
[01:19:25.590 --> 01:19:26.590]  Weed YouTube.
[01:19:26.590 --> 01:19:27.590]  No, no.
[01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:28.590]  But you know.
[01:19:28.590 --> 01:19:30.590]  Max.
[01:19:30.590 --> 01:19:32.590]  Max, settle down, bro.
[01:19:32.590 --> 01:19:37.590]  Actually, guys, if you're making extractions, you need an Emotech machine.
[01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:38.590]  Get yourself an Emotech machine.
[01:19:38.590 --> 01:19:39.590]  Learn how to use it.
[01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:40.590]  Don't blow the fuck up.
[01:19:40.590 --> 01:19:42.590]  Make extractions with an Emotech.
[01:19:42.590 --> 01:19:43.590]  Do it like a big boy.
[01:19:43.590 --> 01:19:44.590]  That's right.
[01:19:44.590 --> 01:19:45.590]  Giddy, he had to run.
[01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:46.590]  He walked away.
[01:19:46.590 --> 01:19:47.590]  He was right here on the couch.
[01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:48.590]  He's running around the room.
[01:19:48.590 --> 01:19:50.590]  Thanks for letting us have a show here at your cool place, man.
[01:19:50.590 --> 01:19:51.590]  My pleasure.
[01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:52.590]  This was awesome.
[01:19:52.590 --> 01:19:53.590]  We'll do this again.
[01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:54.590]  We've got more stuff to talk about.
[01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:55.590]  I'm sure we will be back.
[01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:56.590]  Granny, thanks for staying up late.
[01:19:56.590 --> 01:19:57.590]  Oh, thanks for having me.
[01:19:57.590 --> 01:19:58.590]  I think it's past your guys' bedtime.
[01:19:58.590 --> 01:19:59.590]  I appreciate you for being out this late.
[01:19:59.590 --> 01:20:00.590]  Thanks, Kevin.
[01:20:00.590 --> 01:20:01.590]  Kevin Chick is head like.
[01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:02.590]  Yes, it sure is.
[01:20:02.590 --> 01:20:03.590]  I saw it was 10 o'clock.
[01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:04.590]  We decided to wrap it up.
[01:20:04.590 --> 01:20:05.590]  Bro, you were quiet, but thanks for hanging out.
[01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:06.590]  You brought great concentrates.
[01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:09.590]  That's our friend from out of state who would rather remain anonymous.
[01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:11.590]  You guys, I'm going to wrap up this portion of the podcast.
[01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:13.590]  I'll be back to put a tail on this bitch.
[01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:14.590]  I'm super lit.
[01:20:14.590 --> 01:20:15.590]  Thanks for hanging out with me.
[01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:16.590]  I'll be right back.
[01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:18.590]  It's called grow from your heart.
[01:20:18.590 --> 01:20:20.590]  Max is doing a live Instagram.
[01:20:20.590 --> 01:20:21.590]  I think I'm going to do the same thing.
[01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:22.590]  All right, podcast world.
[01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:26.590]  I want to thank you guys for listening to a long episode of the grow from your heart podcast.
[01:20:26.590 --> 01:20:32.590]  I want to send another huge thank you shout out to dabbing granny, Max from TNT extractions and giddy up.
[01:20:32.590 --> 01:20:37.590]  And of course, to all my new friends I made sitting in the room who did not have microphones, who chose to be silent.
[01:20:37.590 --> 01:20:38.590]  Thanks for hanging out.
[01:20:38.590 --> 01:20:39.590]  I had a great time.
[01:20:39.590 --> 01:20:42.590]  Were you able to listen to the entire podcast?
[01:20:42.590 --> 01:20:43.590]  I know we got a little rambly at the end.
[01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:46.590]  I felt it getting loose, but I thought it was kind of cool.
[01:20:46.590 --> 01:20:47.590]  It was getting comfortable.
[01:20:47.590 --> 01:20:50.590]  Everybody was just being themselves and I felt there was no reason to cut that off.
[01:20:50.590 --> 01:20:55.590]  So I left it in for you guys and I hope you enjoyed the rambly part of the conversation.
