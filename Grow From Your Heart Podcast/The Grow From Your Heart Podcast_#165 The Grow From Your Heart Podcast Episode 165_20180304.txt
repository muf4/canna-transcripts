[00:17.720 --> 00:22.360]  Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis Community. It's time for episode number 165 of the
[00:22.360 --> 00:26.200]  Grow From Your Heart podcast. Your source for cannabis news, education, and
[00:26.200 --> 00:29.400]  conversation. That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional
[00:29.400 --> 00:32.760]  grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis
[00:32.760 --> 00:35.640]  activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of
[00:35.640 --> 00:41.020]  cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you. I'm your host, my friends, call me
[00:41.020 --> 00:44.440]  Rasta Jeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me. As always, I want to
[00:44.440 --> 00:47.320]  send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots Band for
[00:47.320 --> 00:51.500]  letting me use their music on my podcast. Big shout out to Kat, Koot, and the entire
[00:51.500 --> 00:57.800]  Mystic Roots crew. Oh, that music was loud. Wow, sorry about that, Mike. I didn't mean
[00:57.800 --> 01:00.800]  to blot your ears. Oh, we're good, man. Nice, nice. Welcome to the show again, bro.
[01:00.800 --> 01:04.220]  Yeah, thanks for having me back. Ladies and gentlemen, once again joining us on the
[01:04.220 --> 01:07.920]  show is our good buddy, White Mike. Oh, I said good buddy again. Damn, I'm trying not
[01:07.920 --> 01:12.400]  to do that. Hey, buddy. I just feel so cheesy saying good buddy, my good buddy. It's one of
[01:12.400 --> 01:16.220]  those rhythms. I catch myself doing similar stuff. It's appropriate. You're my
[01:16.220 --> 01:21.460]  good buddy. Yep. Awesome. Well, Mike's here, guys. Ladies and gentlemen, while we're
[01:21.460 --> 01:25.260]  doing the intro, remind everybody how they can follow you on social media and
[01:25.260 --> 01:31.420]  also tell them about your useful and successful cannabis Facebook page. You
[01:31.420 --> 01:36.940]  can catch me at at Nemopunk15 on Twitter or Pueblo for sensible cannabis
[01:36.940 --> 01:40.500]  laws on Facebook. Stalk him, you guys. Support him. Check him out. Check it out.
[01:40.500 --> 01:43.900]  Yeah, see what he's doing online. He sends me a lot of cool articles that you'll be
[01:43.900 --> 01:46.740]  able to see if you check out his Twitter. Dude, thanks for joining me on the show.
[01:46.740 --> 01:51.020]  Happy to, man. Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to do a... this is the post-election
[01:51.020 --> 01:54.420]  recap. We're going to talk about what won and what did not win and what went our
[01:54.420 --> 01:57.900]  favor and what may and may not change and how things went. But before we get
[01:57.900 --> 02:02.100]  that far, we've got a few things we want to chatter about. Let's see. Where should
[02:02.100 --> 02:05.300]  I start? People like to hear about my breeding updates. You guys remember I was
[02:05.300 --> 02:11.740]  talking about I had a Rise F1 male and I had pollinated a bunch of stuff and
[02:11.900 --> 02:14.820]  they had gone for a long time. Those have since been harvested. Those were all
[02:14.820 --> 02:18.660]  harvested. All the seeds are taken out. The bud material is in a container
[02:18.660 --> 02:22.500]  getting ready to be turned into hash and the seeds are all in separate containers.
[02:22.500 --> 02:27.020]  They're being distributed to friends of mine for test growth. I am growing a
[02:27.020 --> 02:31.700]  large number of them myself. I'm pretty excited about that. I see some sprouts
[02:31.700 --> 02:35.820]  going and it makes me smile to see some stuff sprouting again. Yeah, so those are
[02:35.820 --> 02:39.180]  being tested. But since those are done, I cleaned up everything. I sprayed
[02:39.420 --> 02:42.140]  everything down with hot water and a little bit of bleach and I cleaned up
[02:42.140 --> 02:45.620]  real well and I got all the pollen out of the room and I'm at it again. I have
[02:45.620 --> 02:49.380]  got some stuff in flower. It is about, I would say it's by the time this comes
[02:49.380 --> 02:54.460]  out, it'll be three weeks into flower. Nice. I'm putting the Arise male to
[02:54.460 --> 02:59.620]  girls. It's a cookies and cream female and that cookies and cream, it was one of
[02:59.620 --> 03:03.860]  the most resinous plants I've ever grown. It produced more. I remember it was some
[03:03.860 --> 03:07.940]  frosty shit, but it just made little pinky sized buds all the way up the
[03:07.940 --> 03:11.620]  stick. Yep. And I could not figure out how to make it produce better. So I'm
[03:11.620 --> 03:15.540]  thinking if I hit it with pollen from the Arise, maybe that big ass Arise cola
[03:15.540 --> 03:19.620]  is going to fix my problem with the cookies and cream. We can hope. And it's
[03:19.620 --> 03:22.500]  going to improve that. Yeah. So that's what I'm hoping for. I also put a white
[03:22.500 --> 03:25.860]  widow, a bunch of white widow in the room to get bred to. There's a grateful
[03:25.860 --> 03:31.140]  dog to get pollinated. There's a lemon Jeffrey to get pollinated. So here they
[03:31.140 --> 03:35.020]  won't get pollinated for, I'm trying to predict the future. Right now at this
[03:35.020 --> 03:38.420]  time, they're about 10 days into flower. Hopefully then we'll get pollinated for
[03:38.420 --> 03:43.660]  another 16 days ish. And then about 50 days from there, the seeds should be
[03:43.660 --> 03:49.300]  ready. So then I have to harvest dry and remove the seeds and then I'll have more
[03:49.300 --> 03:54.180]  stuff to give out to my friends to be tested. And the cycle begins again. It
[03:54.180 --> 03:56.780]  keeps on going. And then we find out what's the best, what's worth making a
[03:56.780 --> 04:00.620]  whole bunch more of. And I'll continue those lines. The things that aren't super
[04:00.620 --> 04:04.700]  impressive since space is limited, time is limited, resources are limited. I just
[04:04.700 --> 04:08.540]  try to make the best of the best. Yeah. Yeah. So we don't have to go calling
[04:08.540 --> 04:11.100]  things in the future. So that's where I am with breeding. I'll keep you guys
[04:11.100 --> 04:13.980]  updated as it gets further along. We're only a few days in, so there's not a lot
[04:13.980 --> 04:17.460]  of stuff to talk about. The male plants are a little bit ahead because I like
[04:17.460 --> 04:21.300]  their, I like their male flowers to develop a little bit further so they can
[04:21.300 --> 04:24.260]  start dropping a lot of pollen. So that when the girls are ready, I got plenty of
[04:24.260 --> 04:27.540]  pollen for all those plants. That's pretty much where we are. I'll keep you
[04:27.540 --> 04:31.820]  guys updated. Speaking of a breeding program, thedankteam.com. If you guys
[04:31.820 --> 04:34.580]  want to know where to get these seeds that have been tested, that are viable,
[04:34.580 --> 04:39.780]  that are reliable, thedankteam.com. They're ready to go. They're Rasta Jeff
[04:39.780 --> 04:44.220]  approved. Make sure you check out thedankteam.com. They have got archive
[04:44.220 --> 04:49.020]  seeds there, I'm pretty sure. They've got, who else they have? They've got Gage Green
[04:49.020 --> 04:53.820]  Genetics, Mile High. They have got Sin City seeds. They've got Irie Genetic
[04:53.820 --> 04:55.980]  seeds. They're a whole bunch of great brands there. I can't think of them off the top of
[04:55.980 --> 04:59.660]  my head because Mike and I took a bunch of fat dabs. It's an impressive list and we took an
[04:59.700 --> 05:04.540]  impressive list of dabs as well. Yes, we may be a little bit medicated. A nice
[05:04.540 --> 05:09.020]  variety of dabs. Shout out to the people that were dabbing us out. It was a nice selection tonight. Yeah, yeah, good work.
[05:09.020 --> 05:14.780]  Let's see, where was I? The Dank Team ad. You guys, I've been putting out
[05:14.780 --> 05:20.620]  episodes on Thursdays. Thursday episodes. Woohoo, Thursday bonus episodes. Gotta love them. I've had a little
[05:20.620 --> 05:23.980]  more time. I've had a little more content available. I've had more friends and I've
[05:23.980 --> 05:27.420]  noticed that sometimes episodes are kind of time sensitive. Like this one we want
[05:27.420 --> 05:30.380]  to get out probably the Monday after the election. Not the Thursday because I want
[05:30.380 --> 05:33.660]  everyone to catch this Monday episode is what I think is going to happen. It's going to be
[05:33.660 --> 05:38.380]  the Monday episode. Yeah, there's no reason to put this one out in three weeks.
[05:38.380 --> 05:43.820]  Yeah, exactly. We'll get it out Monday. So you guys that have religiously or regularly
[05:43.820 --> 05:47.500]  listened to the Monday episodes, don't forget that I've been putting stuff out on Thursdays
[05:47.500 --> 05:50.460]  occasionally. So go back and check your feet. You might have missed something if you're not
[05:50.460 --> 05:55.900]  paying attention. And also thank you for everybody that listens to just the Monday episodes or just
[05:55.900 --> 06:02.060]  the Thursday or everybody. It's fun watching my stats move and all of my statistics on my website
[06:02.060 --> 06:06.540]  on Stitcher. iTunes doesn't show you a damn thing, but the other ones, it's fun watching the stats
[06:06.540 --> 06:12.540]  move. I really enjoy that. So thanks for listening, everybody. I wrote down Narcos was great. I wanted
[06:12.540 --> 06:17.580]  to rant about Narcos. That was a fucking great show. I had fun watching. Great two seasons so far. I'm looking
[06:17.580 --> 06:23.180]  forward to three. Yeah, well, spoiler alert, but I don't want to talk about how it ends, but okay,
[06:23.180 --> 06:28.380]  no spoiler alert. I guess you can't have it. We're safe. It's been a couple of months, but
[06:28.380 --> 06:34.460]  yes, spoiler alert. If you haven't watched Narcos, hit pause and go watch two seasons of Narcos.
[06:34.460 --> 06:40.540]  Yeah. I think that's enough for people to prepare for the spoiler. That ought to be good. No, you go
[06:40.540 --> 06:46.300]  for it. Well, I was familiar with the story before Narcos. Yeah. I mean, you know how it's going to
[06:46.300 --> 06:51.820]  go. So every time they hit a major plot point or a major event and I was like, okay, I know where
[06:51.820 --> 06:57.180]  that falls in the timeline. How are they going to get more than two seasons out of this? And I like
[06:57.180 --> 07:00.540]  where they're headed for season three. I think it's a good transition. They're going to do the
[07:00.540 --> 07:05.100]  Cali cartel is going to be the focus. Yeah. That's a great spot to go from there. It's a
[07:05.660 --> 07:10.220]  really interesting part of history that you don't often see portrayed anywhere.
[07:12.140 --> 07:19.100]  Other than, I mean, even a little bit in class, if you take like a really good history class in
[07:19.100 --> 07:22.620]  college, maybe other than that, you've got to learn this shit on your own. Narcos actually did
[07:22.620 --> 07:27.900]  a nice job presenting it in a fun and an entertaining way. Okay. I know the story and
[07:27.900 --> 07:31.420]  I've read very little, but it sounds like they did a good job. That's right. I didn't know that.
[07:31.420 --> 07:35.980]  Yeah. No, they did a really nice. I don't know about all the little stuff, but the storyline of
[07:37.180 --> 07:45.100]  oh God, I'm so baked right now. The storyline that they follow is accurate. Nice. So I know that
[07:45.100 --> 07:50.060]  Murphy's going to be in the car, Cali cartel show. Are they going to bring Pina back? I hope
[07:50.060 --> 07:53.100]  me too, because those two together, it's like the Beavis and butthead. It's a perfect duo.
[07:53.100 --> 07:58.220]  You need both of them to keep that show balanced. I think. Yeah. I liked both of them together and
[07:58.220 --> 08:02.300]  I was glad that that was one of the things they did in the season finale was a tease that they're
[08:02.300 --> 08:06.140]  bringing Penny back. So I'm pulling up an article that I've got on my phone here. Something we
[08:06.140 --> 08:11.660]  wanted to talk about to keep the show moving here. Just really random, fun story injection
[08:11.660 --> 08:16.460]  for the marijuana community. I saw this headline this week. There's a band somewhere attempting to
[08:16.460 --> 08:22.380]  write a song in four 20 time. And when I saw that, I thought of you specifically because you,
[08:22.380 --> 08:27.420]  you're one of the people in my world that knows what that means. I can already see he's, he's got
[08:27.420 --> 08:32.300]  the expression. Like he wants to laugh, but he can't quite figure out how funny this is or how
[08:32.300 --> 08:37.500]  insane this is. How do you know something about me? I, there's a reason I didn't click play and
[08:37.500 --> 08:43.100]  like hear their attempts so far. Cause I know just enough about music to know what a nightmare
[08:43.100 --> 08:51.660]  that might be. Yeah. It's going to be a lot of fun. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How long does it have to
[08:51.660 --> 08:56.620]  be to count as a song? I have no idea. Cause that's what I like. I can probably play you six
[08:56.620 --> 09:00.620]  minutes, four measures, four to four to five measures. That's not a problem. But after that,
[09:00.620 --> 09:06.940]  you're thinking three verses, two courses. Oh God. Yeah. At least putting a bridge in there.
[09:06.940 --> 09:13.180]  Yeah. I can show outro. Oh man. And four 20 time four beats per measure. You got to do the whole
[09:13.180 --> 09:19.900]  bit, right? 20 counts per 20. Yeah. I'm not going to do the whole thing. Yeah. I saw that. I was
[09:19.900 --> 09:23.740]  like, four beats per measure and each beat gets 20 counts. That was one of those stories that
[09:23.740 --> 09:27.820]  came through right before the election that I was like, thank God there's some, some people out
[09:27.820 --> 09:32.940]  there that are willing to do shit insane enough to make the press, to just change the topic of
[09:32.940 --> 09:37.580]  conversation even for a minute. But yeah, I can still see you trying to wrap your head around it.
[09:37.580 --> 09:42.300]  That's why I remembered the story. So just a couple of cool ways. Are they just going to count 20 beats
[09:42.300 --> 09:47.020]  on the bottom? Are they going to break it down to like a basic, like a, like a five or four or five
[09:47.020 --> 09:52.380]  or something? Yeah. Okay. We'll figure this out. I just did it in my head. I just went one, two,
[09:52.380 --> 09:59.180]  three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. That was just a rock beat and four 20.
[09:59.900 --> 10:06.300]  All right. This went way too far. All right. So a while back, this has been a continuing story.
[10:06.300 --> 10:10.540]  Ongoing story. Ongoing story. A long time ago. It feels like, now this feels like it happened in
[10:10.540 --> 10:16.140]  damn forever. It took, it happened in May of 2015 to be more precise, which in a pothead mind like
[10:16.140 --> 10:19.420]  mine, that was damn forever. Back when we learned not to watch movies on the podcast.
[10:21.500 --> 10:26.540]  All right. So there was a raid in the city of Santa Ana. Yeah. You guys remember this? Yes.
[10:27.340 --> 10:31.580]  The, the police department came in and destroyed the dispensary. They illegally raided the
[10:31.580 --> 10:35.900]  dispensary. They came in, they destroyed the dispensary. They needlessly destroyed a bunch
[10:35.900 --> 10:40.380]  of TVs. They destroyed the cash register. They destroyed the display counters. They basically
[10:40.380 --> 10:44.060]  vandalized the shit out of this place. Imagine if a bunch of teenagers broke into somewhere and
[10:44.060 --> 10:48.940]  were pissed off and just wanted to fuck shit up. That's what they did in there. Yep. And in the
[10:48.940 --> 10:58.780]  process, they also stole and consumed cannabis infused edibles while on the clock, while
[10:58.780 --> 11:05.740]  conducting a raid slash investigation while in possession of a firearm, while taxpayer money was
[11:05.740 --> 11:11.740]  paying their salary while illegally conducting a raid of a legally functioning operating facility.
[11:12.700 --> 11:19.740]  As far as I'm concerned, that's exactly what the security video shows. Unfortunately,
[11:19.740 --> 11:27.820]  most of that wasn't eventually proved in a court of law. The fallout from this has been
[11:28.460 --> 11:34.860]  a year or more in the making. It looks like they're finally done with this. I think all of
[11:34.860 --> 11:43.820]  the officers that are portrayed in the video, his main characters, let's say the nasty female cop
[11:45.420 --> 11:51.020]  who says she was going to kick the one legged old woman who was volunteering at the dispensary
[11:51.020 --> 12:00.380]  quote in her fucking nub. And then the cop that was handing out snack foods and the other cop that
[12:00.460 --> 12:07.500]  was eating snack foods all have resigned. And the city's now paying out what's the total?
[12:07.500 --> 12:14.940]  Okay. City of Santa Ana will pay $100,000 to settle a lawsuit over infamous dispensary raid.
[12:14.940 --> 12:16.940]  Yes. Of taxpayer money.
[12:16.940 --> 12:23.660]  And if I remember the article right, that money's getting split up three ways between two of the
[12:23.660 --> 12:29.340]  main volunteers in the dispensary and then legal counsel basically. That's a good business plan.
[12:30.540 --> 12:36.060]  That's it's not a bad way to disperse the settlement. If as far as I can tell, it's,
[12:37.180 --> 12:41.660]  I'm glad that the city got hit with this though. There's dispensary raids all over the place. This
[12:41.660 --> 12:47.900]  raid was clearly out of line from beginning to end and it should have cost the police some money.
[12:47.900 --> 12:52.380]  It should, it should sting. I'm totally unacceptable from start to finish.
[12:53.100 --> 12:54.860]  You know how I found out about that news article?
[12:55.420 --> 12:56.220]  Me on Twitter.
[12:56.220 --> 12:59.500]  Mike sent it to me on Twitter. You guys, if there's a news article that you'd like me to
[12:59.500 --> 13:04.300]  read that you think I should be aware of, link it to me in Twitter. Just grab it. Send it to me
[13:04.300 --> 13:10.220]  on Twitter at GFYH podcast. I would appreciate it. It gives us more material for the show.
[13:10.220 --> 13:13.500]  Also, if you've got a grow question, if you've got a cannabis related question,
[13:13.500 --> 13:18.140]  a cannabis industry, a cannabis politics, a cannabis etiquette, a cannabis culture,
[13:19.100 --> 13:22.220]  whatever you want to talk about, if it's weed related, shoot, if you want to talk about music
[13:22.220 --> 13:26.540]  and drums, you could send me a message. I may reply about that as well. Grow from your heart
[13:26.540 --> 13:30.140]  at hotmail.com. I'd love to hear from you. I love interaction from the people that are
[13:30.140 --> 13:33.980]  listening to the podcast. We're all friends now. You're hanging out in your car, you're in your
[13:33.980 --> 13:38.220]  cubicle, you're doing whatever you're doing. You're working in the warehouse, carrying boxes.
[13:38.220 --> 13:41.820]  You got your headphones in. Ross to Jeff is keeping you entertained for a little while.
[13:41.820 --> 13:46.300]  We're bros now. We're, even if you're a female, we're bros. We'll still be bros. Don't worry.
[13:46.300 --> 13:50.460]  I don't know. I don't know what else to call you. We're bros. Trust me. Fist bump. We are bros.
[13:50.460 --> 13:54.460]  So yeah, Lindsay just laughed at me. I know, I know. Lindsay put her fist up and laughed at me
[13:54.940 --> 13:59.660]  I know she did wherever she is listening to this podcast. Shout out to Lindsay. She's in Florida
[13:59.660 --> 14:05.100]  right now. So shout out to her. Listener questions and comments generate some of my favorite episodes.
[14:05.100 --> 14:12.060]  Me too. Honestly. Um, the content seems fresher. And when we have, when we're sure that people
[14:12.060 --> 14:16.620]  want to know what we're about to do an episode on, it brings the energy level up. It's like
[14:16.620 --> 14:20.380]  watching people enjoy the food you cook, but I get it in advance because I already know you're
[14:20.380 --> 14:24.860]  going to be happy because I did an episode that you asked for. Yep. I got to serve up what you
[14:24.860 --> 14:29.340]  wanted for dinner. All right. And we know you guys have questions. So by all means, let them fly.
[14:29.340 --> 14:34.860]  We're 15 minutes into this podcast and we have not made any useful. We've got, uh, we've got a big
[14:34.860 --> 14:40.300]  main topic tonight, folks. It was, uh, it was a stressful couple of days. It's been a stressful,
[14:40.300 --> 14:45.100]  Oh man, it's been a stressful six, eight months. Yeah. Yeah. Hey guys on Facebook, can we all just
[14:45.100 --> 14:48.540]  shut the fuck up and be friends again? We're all, we're all in this together. If you agree or
[14:48.540 --> 14:53.260]  disagree or whatever, whatever happens is going to happen. Can we quit bickering and fighting and
[14:53.260 --> 14:57.500]  having a mud sling and dick fucking whipping contest and quit grabbing each other by the
[14:57.500 --> 15:01.980]  pussy and just be friends again on Facebook. Let's go posting weed pictures again, please.
[15:02.540 --> 15:09.340]  Please. Um, it's been highly contentious for, I mean, man, I've been actively working this
[15:09.340 --> 15:16.140]  election since April. Yeah. I mean, just, just wrapping my own head around that hurts.
[15:16.140 --> 15:19.340]  Mike, I gave you a shout out on an episode that I don't know if it has aired yet.
[15:19.340 --> 15:22.940]  Because I do you ingest the episode and appreciated that. Excellent. You guys are
[15:22.940 --> 15:27.820]  awesome. Thank you. Face to face, man. Thank you. Because you came on here. I, all the listeners owe
[15:27.820 --> 15:33.580]  you a shout out. You came on here and kind of reminded us several times, go fucking vote. So
[15:33.580 --> 15:39.260]  thanks dude. Um, that's the first takeaway from last night's election. It's kind of a weird way
[15:39.260 --> 15:46.380]  to jump into, to the main topic tonight, but, uh, really you, you, you have to vote. That's,
[15:46.380 --> 15:51.020]  I mean, it's the one thing that we all do as Americans other than pay taxes and die.
[15:51.020 --> 15:54.780]  That really unites all of us under the same thing. I've got right here. One of my notes,
[15:54.780 --> 15:58.620]  it's the one on the bottom, but I'm going to ask it first, since you're here, do you feel like
[15:58.620 --> 16:04.140]  your vote made an actual difference? Oh, big time. Okay. Um, look at the numbers. I mean,
[16:04.780 --> 16:11.420]  there's a million different ways to rationalize. I didn't vote because my vote didn't matter.
[16:11.420 --> 16:17.420]  But if you actually pull up the numbers, look at your area, look at the different races,
[16:18.140 --> 16:23.020]  thousands and thousands and thousands of people voted in a lot of these races. I mean,
[16:23.020 --> 16:28.940]  even here in Pueblo races around the country, come down to 30 votes, a hundred votes. Um,
[16:28.940 --> 16:34.940]  Pueblo Colorado has been a strong democratic. Um, they call it a democratic stronghold back
[16:34.940 --> 16:43.180]  when Colorado was a hard Republican state, Denver and Pueblo were, uh, or democratic,
[16:43.180 --> 16:51.020]  um, in a thick Republican state. And I mean, for 40 years, Pueblo has been a democratic stronghold
[16:51.100 --> 16:58.060]  and in this election, Trump won by like 240 votes. Um, and literally the, the,
[16:58.060 --> 17:04.220]  our vote for president down here was decided by 240 votes. Um, a couple of the County Commissioner
[17:04.220 --> 17:09.420]  seats, which would directly impact both of our lives and any number of things locally were
[17:09.420 --> 17:15.340]  decided by a few hundred votes, a few thousand votes. Um, and this is nationally when you look
[17:15.340 --> 17:21.100]  at the stuff, um, if you look at the polling data from this election, if Gary Johnson, wasn't a
[17:21.100 --> 17:27.340]  thing, the conversation we're about to have tonight would be very different. Um, Gary Johnson running
[17:27.340 --> 17:34.460]  in the little tiny percent of the vote he got changed vote results all across the country. Um,
[17:35.660 --> 17:40.540]  and that changed the outcome of the election in major, major ways, right there. Uh, it's not just
[17:40.540 --> 17:46.300]  president. It's so easy to, I don't like the two candidates that the main parties put forward for
[17:46.300 --> 17:51.340]  president. I'm not voting. Um, just because you don't like the president, you just gave up all
[17:51.340 --> 17:57.420]  of your decisions on your Senate senators, your house of representatives members, your local
[17:57.420 --> 18:03.260]  election, uh, uh, elect, uh, politicians, your local election issues, your local ballot issues.
[18:03.260 --> 18:07.900]  Right. And a lot of those are really important. I mean, I didn't know how important they were to me
[18:07.900 --> 18:12.940]  until I got my ballot and discovered them. I was like, Oh shit, this, this needs to be voted on.
[18:12.940 --> 18:17.180]  When I first started going through what was finally going to be on this elections ballot
[18:17.180 --> 18:22.220]  here in Colorado, I was like, what the fuck slavery, like not to yell into the microphone,
[18:22.220 --> 18:29.260]  but we literally voted piece down here just for those moments. We literally voted on abolishing
[18:29.260 --> 18:35.260]  essentially indentured servitude or slavery in Colorado's penal system last night. Um,
[18:36.220 --> 18:42.140]  if I, if I caught that vote, right, we voted to end being able to force prisoners to work while
[18:42.140 --> 18:49.020]  they're in jail. Um, it's an option, not, not something you have to do for, or we throw you
[18:49.020 --> 18:54.060]  in isolation or beat you or don't feed you or whatever. Um, which is kind of nuts that that's
[18:54.060 --> 18:58.140]  what we were doing beforehand. But when you see that on the ballot, you're like, wow,
[18:59.340 --> 19:03.340]  I've heard so much about Hillary and I've heard so much about Donald and I've heard so much about
[19:03.340 --> 19:10.380]  Gary, but I've heard nothing about, we still have slavery here. Um, marijuana was on the vote in
[19:10.380 --> 19:14.940]  nine States yesterday. That's another, another subject I wanted to hit. I was going to segue
[19:14.940 --> 19:21.020]  to that. That's, that's our main, uh, our main focus of tonight's election is, is, or tonight's
[19:21.740 --> 19:27.340]  podcast is the election basically. And how it relates to marijuana. Um, I've been on here,
[19:27.340 --> 19:31.900]  a guy, I can't even tell you how many times talking about different marijuana votes,
[19:31.900 --> 19:37.660]  this election locally and nationally. Um, and so this is the wrap up episode for everybody. Welcome.
[19:38.940 --> 19:43.660]  Uh, locally, we can, uh, just brush this out of the way for those of you who have been waiting
[19:43.660 --> 19:50.700]  on pins and needles to figure out if I still have a job. Uh, I do 200 and 300 failed here in Pueblo.
[19:50.700 --> 19:57.180]  So on the, on the ballot were initiatives to pretty much dismantle and shut down the recreational
[19:57.900 --> 20:03.180]  and medical cannabis industries in the city and County of Pueblo, Colorado.
[20:03.180 --> 20:09.020]  If this initiative were to have passed, there would be no more, uh, growing menu processing,
[20:09.020 --> 20:12.860]  which is hash making and edible making. They would have gotten rid of all of the regulated
[20:12.860 --> 20:15.980]  and licensed businesses. All the retail stores would have been gone. How many people were
[20:15.980 --> 20:21.180]  employed by that industry? 1300 is the low ballpark number. Okay. 1300 people would not
[20:21.180 --> 20:26.060]  have had jobs. Fortunately enough. People did go out and vote. That's part of what gives me faith
[20:26.060 --> 20:31.980]  that my vote counted because I of course voted, uh, one of them was like 5,000 and change.
[20:31.980 --> 20:38.700]  And the owner was 7,000 and change, um, both yes and no on these questions got over 20,000 votes.
[20:38.700 --> 20:46.540]  Okay. Um, so literally every vote counted this election, every door that got knocked mattered.
[20:47.260 --> 20:53.660]  Um, had we not done the work that we did on this, these two issues, this vote could easily
[20:53.660 --> 20:57.740]  gone the other way. I'm glad that the other team kind of started floundering at the end there.
[20:57.740 --> 21:03.260]  They ran a very bizarre campaign. Um, I don't really want to get into the ins and outs of our
[21:03.260 --> 21:09.580]  local fight and why we won, but thank God we won. Um, but it was a weird election here in Pueblo
[21:09.580 --> 21:15.020]  too. We, uh, so questions 200 and 300 were voting to ban all the licensed businesses.
[21:15.580 --> 21:22.380]  Um, but we also had questions to be in to see which we're going to allow, uh,
[21:22.460 --> 21:29.740]  we currently allow all marijuana businesses except retail stores under amendment 64 licensing in the
[21:29.740 --> 21:36.300]  city. Um, so we allow medical, all, all the medical businesses and we allow every type of recreational
[21:36.300 --> 21:42.380]  business except the retail storefront locations. Um, and that was on the ballot down here in Pueblo
[21:42.380 --> 21:49.100]  this time too. Do we want the storefronts in Pueblo and voters said no. And that question lost
[21:49.100 --> 21:55.260]  by like 1100 votes. Wow. That's not, that's not much. Nope. That's one in apartment building.
[21:55.980 --> 22:01.020]  Yeah. Right. Um, that's two or three city blocks with the votes. It's not, it's not a big number.
[22:01.020 --> 22:07.660]  It's easily swingable the other way with a hard work and focus. But I mean, unfortunately here
[22:07.660 --> 22:13.660]  in Pueblo, the entire marijuana community had a hundred percent of their efforts invested in 200
[22:13.660 --> 22:21.900]  and 300 being defeated. And clearly from these results, we let to be in to see, um, just sit
[22:21.900 --> 22:28.140]  ignored. And because of that, they lost by a very, very small margin. Was one of those, the, uh, the
[22:28.140 --> 22:34.220]  new cannabis tax. Yep. The, the, the, the city was asking if they could have, if they could allow
[22:34.220 --> 22:39.580]  stores and if they could tax those stores at a special rate. And both of those questions failed
[22:39.580 --> 22:46.860]  as well. Um, the anti-pot group theory on this is that people just voted no on everything. Um,
[22:46.860 --> 22:51.340]  and if you look at the election results, a lot of the other questions that were asked,
[22:51.340 --> 22:56.060]  people also voted no. Um, the public safety taxes and things like that, that were on the ballot here
[22:56.060 --> 23:01.260]  in Pueblo all got voted down. Um, so no more money for cops, no more money for police, no more money
[23:01.260 --> 23:07.660]  for the district attorney's office. Um, how did the cigarette tax do? Failed statewide. Okay. Um,
[23:07.740 --> 23:12.060]  which is where I voted against my own interest in that one and voted for it. I voted for it.
[23:12.060 --> 23:17.660]  Um, I know a lot of people who voted for it. Um, increasing that tax revenue would have been good
[23:17.660 --> 23:21.420]  for the state, but, uh, so I know you're, we're trying to work on the new, you want to, you really
[23:21.420 --> 23:25.100]  want to talk about the new medical States and the new recreational States. I know, but I keep,
[23:25.100 --> 23:31.900]  I keep procrastinating. Great, great. I'm trying to Chris, the other local piece of, um, marijuana
[23:31.900 --> 23:39.820]  election news is Denver's issue. 300 Pueblo's issue. 300 was bad. Denver's issue. 300 was good.
[23:40.380 --> 23:47.660]  Um, that this is the question about allowing public consumption clubs, um, in bars, restaurants,
[23:47.660 --> 23:53.820]  taverns, and then clubs that are specifically set up to be private consumption clubs, uh, in Denver
[23:53.820 --> 23:58.140]  County, uh, basically the right to consume marijuana in public with your friends in an
[23:58.140 --> 24:04.060]  enclosed space designed for that purpose. Um, and right now it's winning, but by a tiny,
[24:04.060 --> 24:11.420]  tiny percentage, it's like 50.2% to 49.9 or some shit. Like it's incredibly close.
[24:11.420 --> 24:16.940]  It's one of those races that really hammers home the point that every single vote. Yeah. Somebody
[24:16.940 --> 24:20.540]  would have broken down on the way to vote. It could have gone a different way. Yep. I mean,
[24:20.540 --> 24:23.820]  there was traffic that night that vote changes. Someone's Uber didn't show up.
[24:24.380 --> 24:29.420]  It's, I mean, it was very, very close and they're still counting those with the absentee ballots.
[24:29.420 --> 24:35.180]  That vote won't be a hundred percent finalized, um, for another day or two now. Okay. And there's
[24:35.180 --> 24:40.300]  another race that's like that, that we're going to get to here in a minute. Um, so let's jump on
[24:40.300 --> 24:45.580]  to national news guys. Did your, uh, did your issues win to the stuff that you voted for locally?
[24:45.580 --> 24:52.620]  What percentage of those would you say came out in your favor? Um, almost all. Okay. Um, uh,
[24:52.620 --> 24:59.260]  it was the national stuff that, uh, didn't go my way, but, uh, uh, we're going to get to that here
[24:59.260 --> 25:05.900]  in a few minutes as well. But, uh, most of the stuff I voted for, uh, um, everybody,
[25:05.900 --> 25:11.580]  or not everybody in public, but the majority of voters in public agree on, okay. Um, which was
[25:11.580 --> 25:16.300]  nice. It's always nice to know. It's like, Oh yeah, you are in the majority. Um, I'm so relieved
[25:16.300 --> 25:21.020]  about 200 and 300, man. I had no idea how to vote when it asked me about judges. Do you want this
[25:21.020 --> 25:26.540]  judge to retain his position? I was like, I have the only, there's an answer for that. They, uh,
[25:26.540 --> 25:36.380]  no one does. Okay. And so in every state, there is a group of people made up of, um, uh, not judges,
[25:36.380 --> 25:46.060]  but, uh, lawyers, prosecutors, district attorneys, um, defense attorneys, uh, will and probate
[25:46.060 --> 25:50.620]  lawyers, like all kinds of different legal professionals that are practicing in that state.
[25:50.700 --> 25:57.180]  Um, kind of the best of the best get put together and then come up with a, a retain or don't retain
[25:57.180 --> 26:03.980]  list basically. And so if you Google your state and then like judge retention or whatever,
[26:03.980 --> 26:10.220]  you should be able to find that group in your area. And then they tell you, um, judge Billy Bob,
[26:10.220 --> 26:15.340]  you should, you should retain him because X, Y, and Z, or you shouldn't retain him because of X,
[26:15.340 --> 26:20.300]  Y, and Z. Um, but the way it works in practice is nobody knows. So everybody just votes. Yes.
[26:20.940 --> 26:25.180]  Um, and so judge retention rates are like 93% or 94% across the country.
[26:25.180 --> 26:29.980]  The only judge I've had interaction with, and I'm knocking on wood, praising job for this one. Uh,
[26:29.980 --> 26:34.220]  the only judge I've had interaction with over the past few years was the guy that resided over my
[26:34.220 --> 26:38.700]  jury duty selection. And I don't remember his name, but if I remembered it, he'd get a, yeah,
[26:38.700 --> 26:43.340]  he was cool. Like I had nothing wrong. He, that guy was polite to me. He was, he treated me like
[26:43.340 --> 26:47.580]  the old lady in a blouse next to me. I know the judge you're talking about, I'm spacing his name,
[26:47.580 --> 26:51.820]  but he's a really nice human being and he's a pretty good judge. He was a cool dude. Um,
[26:52.860 --> 26:57.740]  but a lot of people in my world are in the, that live in the legal world. And so, um,
[26:59.020 --> 27:03.580]  I always have an ear full of judge this, or this judge is great. This judge isn't.
[27:04.300 --> 27:07.260]  Yeah. Uh, how about you, man? Did the election go your way?
[27:08.060 --> 27:12.060]  Yeah. For the most part, for what, for the, for you basically just told me that all the stuff I
[27:12.060 --> 27:16.380]  was mostly worried about the tax, the cannabis tax sucks. That's not cool. Uh, I don't think that
[27:16.380 --> 27:20.620]  we should be adding extra taxes to cannabis. It's already expensive enough. I think taxing it just
[27:20.620 --> 27:25.020]  encourages more of the black market sale. I kind of figured it was going to fail for that reason.
[27:25.020 --> 27:30.380]  Yeah. That's a silly thing. And considering the tax rate that our retail stores pay already,
[27:30.380 --> 27:36.460]  that, I mean, it's steep enough. And obviously I, I'm not excited about the president that
[27:36.460 --> 27:40.700]  represents us now, but other than that, I guess I can live with everything else that happened.
[27:40.700 --> 27:46.940]  The, the national election could have some serious implications for, for marijuana nationally.
[27:46.940 --> 27:53.740]  I'm willing to trade our shitty cannabis taxes and our lack of recreational dispensaries in Pueblo
[27:53.740 --> 28:00.140]  city limits to allow the other States to have a jump on cannabis. That's fine. I'll go for that.
[28:00.140 --> 28:04.540]  We're covered here in Pueblo. Like I feel bad for the city of Pueblo is who I feel bad for.
[28:04.540 --> 28:07.340]  I'm self-sufficient when it comes to cannabis. So a lot of that just kind of.
[28:08.300 --> 28:12.540]  A lot of us here are, but I mean, honestly, the city's had three years.
[28:12.540 --> 28:18.140]  Well, and also they limited our plant count. Yep. Yes. In the city of Pueblo, we were allowed to
[28:18.140 --> 28:22.380]  grow. We had a hundred square feet. That's still the rule in the city. It's the county that's
[28:22.380 --> 28:27.740]  limited to 18. Okay. Okay. So the county just did that as a county commissioner rule. That wasn't a
[28:27.740 --> 28:31.100]  vote. You guys, I know that sounds strange, but the city of Pueblo is like a different part of
[28:31.100 --> 28:35.980]  the county. The county is the outer area. That's not like that's, it gets a little more rural,
[28:36.620 --> 28:40.620]  yep. That's a hard word to say when you're high enough. This many dabs into the evening
[28:40.620 --> 28:45.420]  rural gets tough. It's a little dustier and a little more wolves and shit that direction.
[28:46.220 --> 28:51.740]  The row ads are shitty out there. They are row ads dark and it's all falling apart, but yeah.
[28:51.740 --> 28:55.820]  So the county is a different area, so they have a little bit different rules and they actually,
[28:55.820 --> 29:02.700]  we did vote on uniting them. There was an option. Oh no, it was no, that was question one C in
[29:02.940 --> 29:09.660]  question. One C here in Pueblo County asked if the county commissioners had voter approval
[29:10.220 --> 29:15.980]  to take our, our current plant cap of 18 per residential property, if they could have
[29:16.540 --> 29:22.860]  our support going to the state legislature in arguing to make that rule statewide.
[29:22.860 --> 29:28.140]  And the only reason they put that on the ballot is because when county commissioners go to the
[29:28.140 --> 29:34.540]  state legislature and say, please make this rule. If they're able to say, we put it on the ballot
[29:34.540 --> 29:39.980]  and a majority of our constituents supported us bringing this question to you and asking you to
[29:39.980 --> 29:47.980]  do this, the legislature listens a little more closely. And that's all question one C did was
[29:47.980 --> 29:53.580]  give the county commissioners permission to say, and the voters support us asking this of you.
[29:54.140 --> 29:59.100]  All right. A lot of people freaked out about that one. And honestly, in all the hoopla last night,
[30:00.220 --> 30:05.260]  today, when somebody asked me about question one C, I space, I couldn't even remember what number
[30:05.260 --> 30:10.780]  it was. I was impressed that you have known as many numbers as quickly as you have. I've been
[30:10.780 --> 30:16.380]  breaking down data all day. I'm looking, cause there was a big screw up in Pueblo. You've got
[30:16.380 --> 30:20.300]  data eyes. You've got that like computer screen face when you showed up.
[30:20.540 --> 30:26.620]  Um, I've, there was a screw up in Pueblo County. Our, uh, our ballot was really, really long this
[30:26.620 --> 30:32.060]  year. It was four pages. And so when they started running through these ballots through the servers
[30:32.060 --> 30:37.500]  for the, the election department, the servers got overwhelmed because there was like just each
[30:37.500 --> 30:42.700]  chunk of information for each ballot was a little bit larger than usual because the ballot was twice
[30:42.700 --> 30:48.300]  as long. And they, uh, they're reporting that they filled up a server and that the state election
[30:48.300 --> 30:55.340]  commission had to put a server in a van and floor it down here yesterday afternoon, install the
[30:55.340 --> 31:01.260]  server, run test software on it half the evening and fired it back up. Our local electric, uh,
[31:01.260 --> 31:07.820]  department people went home at 3.00 AM with instructions to report back at nine. Wow. Yep.
[31:07.820 --> 31:12.140]  Um, and so we were crunching as much data as we could last night. And then I've been looking at
[31:12.140 --> 31:17.500]  it all day and, uh, I still hadn't looked at one C with everything else that happened last night.
[31:17.500 --> 31:23.740]  It was such a bizarre election. The data is really, really weird. Um, we're seeing demographic
[31:23.740 --> 31:31.100]  changes in Colorado that we haven't seen in our lifetime. Um, the population is growing here
[31:31.100 --> 31:38.300]  rapidly. Um, people that are from here are moving. There are huge numbers of people, um, from around
[31:38.300 --> 31:42.940]  the country that are moving here for a variety of reasons. And that's changing the demographics
[31:42.940 --> 31:50.220]  all over the state in ways nobody predicted. Um, and then nationally, no one expected marijuana
[31:50.220 --> 31:56.220]  to do this. Good. Everybody was hopeful. Um, but nationally marijuana just crushed it.
[31:56.220 --> 32:00.300]  So I want to ask one more local, uh, just a quick one and then we'll get off the local stuff. You
[32:00.300 --> 32:03.100]  guys, I know we probably bore the shit out of you guys with just local, but then we're going to talk
[32:03.100 --> 32:07.500]  about the new States. They do a shout out hashtag. We like it when they like it, when you ramble,
[32:07.500 --> 32:12.140]  uh, we're going to talk about new States in just one second, but on the Colorado, uh,
[32:12.140 --> 32:16.300]  option yet, Mike signal is going to kill me. Cause I want to take a dab before we get to the
[32:16.300 --> 32:22.700]  national stuff. Now, there you go. Uh, on the, the ballot was a question about basically assisted
[32:22.700 --> 32:27.100]  suicide. What the law basically said was if a person is deemed, Oh, excuse me, I'm going to
[32:27.100 --> 32:32.300]  burp. Let me just get it out of the way. Okay. I'm better now. Way better. Excuse me. Oh, it
[32:32.300 --> 32:37.020]  smells like dank ass pizza too. I apologize if that hits you, Mike, because it was ripe. Uh, so
[32:37.020 --> 32:41.260]  on the, on the ballot there was, I'm calling it the assisted suicide. I don't remember what it's
[32:41.420 --> 32:46.700]  called. Uh, totally fair description of the terminally, if you're terminally assisted
[32:46.700 --> 32:49.980]  suicide. Yes. Yes. If you're terminally ill and you're going to die within six months.
[32:49.980 --> 32:55.580]  And I think it takes two doctors to verify this and you can't be mentally ill. You have to be
[32:55.580 --> 33:00.860]  like some sound mind to say that this is what you want. We're only the third or fourth,
[33:00.860 --> 33:07.660]  maybe the fifth state to do anything like this. And so the law is very, very careful and meticulous
[33:07.660 --> 33:14.780]  about the process for this. Um, and there was a lot of anti, uh, I can't remember the number,
[33:14.780 --> 33:19.740]  the, the ballot issue for this one, but the opposition campaign, their main argument was
[33:20.300 --> 33:24.700]  if your shitty children will euthanize you to get their inheritance quicker
[33:26.540 --> 33:31.020]  was the argument. And when people were like, but the doctor's part, they were like, well,
[33:31.020 --> 33:36.460]  they'll just pay the doctor more. No, no, not at all. That's just silly. Side note. We can't
[33:36.460 --> 33:41.420]  get a doctor to write an extended plant count in Colorado. They're not going to risk their
[33:41.420 --> 33:44.860]  license for a plant. They're definitely not going to risk their license to fucking kill you.
[33:44.860 --> 33:51.180]  That is not going to happen. It was just a silly argument. And I know everybody's beliefs on this
[33:51.180 --> 33:55.020]  are going to vary, but I mean, because you brought it up, I don't want to tell him the
[33:55.020 --> 33:59.260]  listeners that I a hundred percent support. I filled in that bubble. Yes. Really strong. I
[33:59.260 --> 34:03.340]  was in let's do that. Uh, I watched a family member, uh, shout out to my grandma. My grandma
[34:03.340 --> 34:07.580]  had a stroke. My grandma was very dignified woman. She was bad as fuck. She raised six kids.
[34:07.580 --> 34:11.980]  She worked until pretty much the day she fell down and had a stroke. She had a solid job. She took
[34:11.980 --> 34:15.500]  care of the family. She took good care of her husband. She took good care of the grandkids.
[34:15.500 --> 34:21.500]  That's me. Uh, one day she had a stroke. She was paralyzed on her left side. She hated that. She
[34:21.500 --> 34:26.460]  wanted to get up and do laundry and fucking cook for us and do what grandma did. Uh, she couldn't
[34:26.460 --> 34:31.580]  do it anymore. Uh, I swear that when I would go visit her in the nursing home, she'd look me
[34:31.580 --> 34:35.420]  straight in the eye and then look at the plug for her machines. Like you're the only one that would
[34:35.420 --> 34:38.460]  have the balls to do it. Well, you're each over there and unplug that for me, Jeff. That's which
[34:38.460 --> 34:43.740]  my grandma was saying to me. She was, she did not want to live in. She couldn't speak. She couldn't
[34:43.740 --> 34:49.100]  speak anymore. There's so many instances in this country where, um, for one reason or another,
[34:49.100 --> 34:57.100]  we, we significantly prolonged suffering for, for absolutely no reason. It's almost like,
[34:57.180 --> 35:03.100]  of course I wanted my grandma still, but I did not want to have to have grandma miserable. Like
[35:03.740 --> 35:08.060]  if I would, if she could speak, if I would have fucking held something up, say grandma unplug
[35:08.060 --> 35:13.340]  or plug, Judah fucking smack that unplug with whatever momentum she could generate with whatever.
[35:13.340 --> 35:21.980]  Yeah. I have a family member with Parkinson's and part of them coming to terms and kind of
[35:21.980 --> 35:28.860]  figuring out how to live after that diagnosis, um, was setting up basically with a number of
[35:28.860 --> 35:35.420]  people in their life that, um, if the time comes that I want to go, like, will you help me acquire
[35:35.420 --> 35:41.100]  whatever I have to acquire to get that done? Um, because this law didn't exist then, right? Uh,
[35:41.100 --> 35:46.620]  because their only option was to continue to wither away. Um, while they were a hundred percent
[35:46.620 --> 35:51.260]  aware of their body collapsing around them. I mean, it was, it's an incredibly brutal diagnosis
[35:51.340 --> 35:57.100]  and, uh, um, this issue was close to me and I was glad I was thrilled that it passed with it. I
[35:57.100 --> 36:01.740]  mean, crushed it last night. It passed with two thirds of the vote. Oh, okay. It didn't just win
[36:01.740 --> 36:05.900]  it. It, it won in a landslide. Well, that's, that's one that I strongly supported because
[36:05.900 --> 36:10.060]  I'm going to get old one day and I don't need anybody. I don't want to be a burden on anybody.
[36:10.060 --> 36:15.260]  I have, I can't, I'm, I'm a young strapping young lad. You know what I'm saying? I'm able bodied.
[36:15.260 --> 36:19.180]  If some shit needs to be done, I could probably do it. And I don't want to be, I don't want to be
[36:19.180 --> 36:24.620]  a burden on somebody. The wife has instructions. If, if I'm a vegetable or a burden harvest,
[36:24.620 --> 36:30.140]  what you can for other people in cremate the rest, sprinkle it over a pot field. Yep. There you go.
[36:31.180 --> 36:35.900]  Yeah. Preferably with some sun on the sunny side. All right. So I'm glad that one passed. I'm glad
[36:35.900 --> 36:40.460]  you supported that one. Yeah. I hope that wasn't too weird for anybody. Yeah. I, I didn't mean to
[36:40.460 --> 36:44.220]  get into the right to die on this podcast, but, uh, that's, that's how we stand on that. Something
[36:44.220 --> 36:48.380]  I supported when I saw it. I was like, that's an option. We're doing that. Yeah. Yeah. That's,
[36:48.700 --> 36:51.820]  that's something that needs to be, yeah. You get the right to live. I don't get the right to die.
[36:51.820 --> 36:55.740]  That's kind of weird. I'm an American. I can put whatever I want in my body. That includes a
[36:55.740 --> 36:59.100]  cigarette and that includes Mountain Dew and that includes cheeseburgers and that fucking includes
[36:59.100 --> 37:04.140]  a bullet. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Free freedom. All right. So let's get to what we've been kind of
[37:04.140 --> 37:08.300]  hinting at. We didn't even mention the fucking elephant in the room. We got fucking the fucking
[37:08.300 --> 37:12.380]  Oompa Loompa is our president now. So grab a ride by the pussy, everybody. And that's all I got to
[37:12.380 --> 37:19.260]  say. Uh, grab life by the pussy folks. We've got some new States that are on team medical cannabis
[37:19.260 --> 37:25.340]  in 2017. We've got, uh, coming out of the gate with fresh cannabis. Um, the, the first big news
[37:25.340 --> 37:31.660]  last night was Florida. Uh, Florida is now medical marijuana state. Uh, welcome to the club, Florida.
[37:31.660 --> 37:36.700]  That was not an easy run for you. Um, an insane amount of money was spent to get you a lot of
[37:36.700 --> 37:42.860]  Florida might be more appropriate. Um, but welcome to the club, Florida. Um, it's about time.
[37:43.580 --> 37:48.460]  It was nice to see a lot of the stuff we're talking about tonight was East coast. Yeah. Yeah. Um, even
[37:48.460 --> 37:54.780]  Bible belt, uh, Rhode Island passed a marijuana initiative. Didn't they? Uh, have one, uh, Maine,
[37:54.780 --> 38:01.180]  Maine is who I'm thinking of. Maine is the same as the maybe. Um, okay. Right now, Maine's, uh,
[38:01.180 --> 38:09.100]  they're a recreational legalization, um, state, uh, right now that question is winning by a tiny,
[38:09.100 --> 38:13.740]  tiny percentage. So it's been 24 hours. They're still counting shit. Yep. There's like fucking
[38:13.740 --> 38:19.580]  eight people in Maine. This is back to every single vote counts. They're counting absentee
[38:19.580 --> 38:24.460]  ballots. They're counting the military ballots, counting the fishermen ballots. Um, and in a lot
[38:24.460 --> 38:30.860]  of places for no reason whatsoever, people waited until yesterday to vote, um, when they had
[38:30.860 --> 38:35.740]  significant other options. And so, I mean, people were still voting at eight o'clock last night and
[38:35.740 --> 38:40.540]  then it's at eight o'clock or seven o'clock or whenever the polls close, they start counting
[38:40.540 --> 38:47.500]  the ballots then. I bet. Don't start like they don't get a fucking for the most part. They don't
[38:47.500 --> 38:52.300]  even get to jump on it. Um, and that's part of the reason on the pot industry, are they?
[38:53.340 --> 38:59.580]  Fuck. Um, that's part of the reason why the, this stuff is so slow. Um, and that's part of the
[38:59.580 --> 39:05.660]  reason why you don't see early vote totals for votes cast anywhere. Um, like I voted like three
[39:05.660 --> 39:10.300]  weeks ago. Yeah. I've heard like two days after my ballot arrived, I mailed it in the night of
[39:10.300 --> 39:15.980]  the third debate. Um, my wife had some wine. I enjoyed some cannabis. We watched the debate.
[39:15.980 --> 39:20.540]  We still have about a half an hour to process what the fuck we just watched. And then we went
[39:20.540 --> 39:24.540]  through our ballot and it was a long ballot. So it took like two hours and there was a lot of
[39:24.540 --> 39:29.180]  freaking out while we did it, but they make it real easy in Colorado. And then there was this
[39:29.340 --> 39:33.820]  two and a half, three week period where, you know, they fucking got votes and they just won't tell
[39:33.820 --> 39:38.620]  you what they say yet. And it's real frustrating when you're doing election work because that's
[39:38.620 --> 39:42.780]  information that you could use. I was going to say they don't want to sway anything. But that's
[39:42.780 --> 39:47.980]  part of the reason they don't do it is because if I say Jeff's winning over Mike by 10 votes,
[39:47.980 --> 39:52.140]  all of a sudden Mike supporters have a rallying cry to get more people. Yeah. Yeah. Should I
[39:52.140 --> 39:56.380]  better get out there and vote? Yup. And that's, I think that's part of what we saw nationally
[39:56.380 --> 40:02.060]  last night. How many people saw things saying Hillary was 85% to win, um, two or three days ago
[40:02.060 --> 40:06.940]  on national media. So when, when is the next, we got four years to the next election. When,
[40:06.940 --> 40:11.180]  when can I start getting people to register to vote again? I know I just totally tried to
[40:11.180 --> 40:15.100]  read your idea. Yeah. They know immediately they can do that now for the next, for the 2020
[40:15.100 --> 40:19.740]  election for when Michael Franti runs for president. Yup. All right. The front, you Warren
[40:20.380 --> 40:27.340]  Franti. Um, even better, but, uh, I'm pretty proud of you for that. You guys it's Michael
[40:27.340 --> 40:31.100]  Franti from spearhead and uncle Warren Haynes from government meal. They'd make a great president.
[40:31.100 --> 40:34.540]  No, no, no. I'm going to Warren Haynes from government meal. I don't give a fuck. I'm going
[40:34.540 --> 40:39.020]  to Warren Haynes from government meal. I don't even know who that is. I'm good. My, my, my,
[40:39.020 --> 40:44.700]  my Wook fans, the Wooks out there, bring on the political people. They're down with,
[40:44.700 --> 40:50.300]  they're down with Elizabeth Warren. I'm going Warren back to our medical marijuana States.
[40:50.300 --> 40:56.860]  We've got Florida. Congratulations, Florida. Yes. North Dakota. Is that rec or medical? Medical?
[40:56.860 --> 41:00.940]  I'm doing all medical right now. Good job. North Dakota is now a medical marijuana state,
[41:01.820 --> 41:08.620]  Arkansas. Welcome to the club, Arkansas. Bang. Oh, welcome. Dang. Oh, welcome. Exactly.
[41:08.620 --> 41:17.260]  Who saw that coming? That's fucking crazy. Um, I'm 99% sure Florida, North Dakota and Arkansas
[41:17.260 --> 41:25.660]  all voted Trump. So we got, I'm 99% sure that Florida, North Dakota and Arkansas almost always
[41:25.660 --> 41:34.620]  lean conservative and they still went medical. Like this is spreading in ways that are, are,
[41:34.620 --> 41:39.820]  were unheard of five years ago. Yeah. Um, States that were guaranteed to never
[41:40.460 --> 41:48.620]  liberalize their marijuana laws are now doing so. Um, I, I mean, in, in numbers that are shocking.
[41:49.420 --> 41:54.380]  Um, so those are the three new medical States. Um, I actually think that I might have two missing
[41:54.380 --> 42:01.940]  on my list. Uh, one, two, three, four. Would you have some rec States? No, no, no. They're all
[42:02.100 --> 42:07.700]  I think I may be missing one. Yeah. You told me four and I think there were five. Okay. So, um,
[42:07.700 --> 42:13.700]  Nevada, Nevada, uh, no Nevada passed Arizona failed. That's the one I miss in Arizona. There
[42:13.700 --> 42:19.060]  she is. Okay. Um, okay. So now for rec States, recreational marijuana, any adult over 21,
[42:19.780 --> 42:23.940]  um, California welcome to the club. Cali amendment 64 crushed it.
[42:24.660 --> 42:29.300]  Is that, do you, I don't even know if I want to get into the amendment 64 debate. I've got
[42:29.300 --> 42:33.540]  friends on both sides of that battle. Uh, they live in California that are on both sides of the
[42:33.540 --> 42:38.740]  industry, the big business side, the small business side, the last two months saw the
[42:38.740 --> 42:45.460]  existing industry pairing up with national anti-marijuana forces, um, to fight amendment
[42:45.460 --> 42:51.940]  64 or proposition 64 in California, the, the, the medical marijuana existing industry and the
[42:51.940 --> 42:57.300]  marijuana advocate community paired up with project Sam, Bucky, Kevin, Sabette, and Patrick
[42:57.300 --> 43:03.380]  Kennedy's nightmare of an anti-marijuana group to fight legalization in California, largely for
[43:03.380 --> 43:09.780]  economic reasons. If marijuana is legal in, in real companies can invest real money and open
[43:09.780 --> 43:14.980]  real businesses. And it's really regulated and it's really lab tested. I can't grow weed in my
[43:14.980 --> 43:21.700]  basement, make a living anymore. Um, I saw that weed in my basement and take it to a store shelf
[43:21.700 --> 43:25.380]  and make money that way anymore. I know guys that happened to, and I know a lot of people that
[43:26.340 --> 43:30.740]  made us have to become master growers at facilities and have other ways of income.
[43:31.380 --> 43:38.020]  It's like, I'm sorry, but that's the point of legalization. Um, we're not legalizing Mara
[43:38.020 --> 43:44.420]  marijuana because we can't get it. We're not legalizing marijuana because it's hard to find
[43:45.380 --> 43:51.780]  or because it was too difficult to, to call my fucking dealer on my way to work and make sure he
[43:51.780 --> 43:58.820]  was going to be around after work. We're doing it because we're sick of that. We want legal,
[43:58.820 --> 44:03.540]  we want lab tested. We want to be able to swing by the store on our way home. Just like we do
[44:03.540 --> 44:07.940]  for the milk and cookies and the eggs and the chicken, the whiskey and the beer and everything
[44:07.940 --> 44:13.620]  else. I don't want to have to call a friend when I want to buy sneakers. Like I don't want to wait
[44:13.620 --> 44:18.260]  two days because he's not answering my texts right now because he's with some hot new chick.
[44:18.260 --> 44:23.060]  So I can buy a jacket. Like, I don't know why people are still willing to do this for the
[44:23.060 --> 44:28.820]  marijuana. Is that a common thing with dope guys? It's a can be, um, on like the Reddit
[44:28.820 --> 44:33.780]  marijuana forums and stuff. You see people bitching about a dealer etiquette, a customer
[44:33.780 --> 44:39.300]  etiquette constantly. That's funny. Um, I forgot those ones. It's Lee. I it's, I would have to,
[44:39.300 --> 44:44.340]  if I didn't keep up with parts of the online community that are still in illegal States,
[44:44.980 --> 44:50.020]  um, that still have to deal with it. Do you remember when you were always wondering if the
[44:50.020 --> 44:55.540]  person you were meeting up with was going to have either the money or the pot product they told you
[44:55.540 --> 45:00.420]  they were going to have, or if they were going to have two homies and a knife or a gun, you just
[45:00.420 --> 45:05.060]  never knew. Yeah. All that's gone. Like when you go buy jeans, you don't wonder if you're going to
[45:05.060 --> 45:10.340]  get robbed. Like when you go buy a big Mac, you don't have to arrange it first and then wait
[45:10.340 --> 45:14.500]  outside and then hang out for two hours. So you don't look like foot traffic have exact change.
[45:14.500 --> 45:18.500]  Yep. You don't have to carry drumsticks in and out with you every time, pretending like you're
[45:18.500 --> 45:24.180]  taking fucking drum lessons. You can just go to the store, buy your marijuana, know that it's not
[45:24.180 --> 45:31.460]  filled with pesticides, spider mite eggs, go home and enjoy it. And it's, that's why we're doing it.
[45:31.460 --> 45:35.300]  And it comes with a lot of benefits. If you are a weirdo looking dude and you're carrying around,
[45:35.620 --> 45:40.500]  portions of things that you need concealed, a guitar case is my favorite way to do that type
[45:40.500 --> 45:45.300]  of shit out in the open. You just fucking got a big old guitar case filled with whatever.
[45:45.300 --> 45:49.460]  Desperado style. Well, mine's usually a little more peaceful. I used to put
[45:49.460 --> 45:53.780]  shit in there. A lot of, a lot of good shit in there. Drumsticks and stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[45:53.780 --> 45:57.460]  Yeah. But if you've got a lot of drumsticks that you need to like vacuum seal and wrap real tight,
[45:57.460 --> 46:00.340]  you could fit a lot of them in a guitar case and it just looks normal. You can just walk around
[46:00.340 --> 46:04.820]  with it. You're like, Oh, I'm a fucking hippie with a guitar case. You don't even, it's no question.
[46:04.820 --> 46:08.100]  Unless someone wants to steal your guitar or, or a chick wants you to play a song.
[46:12.880 --> 46:15.120]  Back to the list of new rec states.
[46:17.840 --> 46:22.800]  Thank you. This tangent is brought to you by Blue OG from Botanico.
[46:24.960 --> 46:31.280]  Live resin makes my head spin. California is now recreational marijuana state. Massachusetts,
[46:31.280 --> 46:35.360]  bringing up our first East Coast recreational state. Shout out to all my assholes.
[46:35.360 --> 46:42.320]  Yep. This, uh, uh, mass was a really, really contested race. There were, there's a lot of
[46:42.320 --> 46:47.680]  outside money. Um, there were a lot of outside anti-marijuana groups throwing their, their two
[46:47.680 --> 46:53.600]  cents and their reefer madness at the issue there. I've spent a little bit of time in Massachusetts,
[46:53.600 --> 46:58.320]  one of my best friends on the planet. So, uh, I went to high school and after high school,
[46:58.320 --> 47:03.360]  I went on fish tour and then did some panic shows and 90% of that time sitting next to me in the
[47:03.360 --> 47:07.680]  passenger seat or the driver's seat, occasionally it was my buddy, Rob, the dude, uh, shout out to
[47:07.680 --> 47:12.320]  Rob, the dude. And he is in Massachusetts. He's a mass hole. One summer we did a bunch of widespread
[47:12.320 --> 47:18.160]  panic shows, uh, from New Mexico all the way to Boston. And we missed a couple of shows cause
[47:18.160 --> 47:23.280]  the car broke, but, uh, we had a good ass time, but he moved to Quincy mass, I think was kind of
[47:23.280 --> 47:28.640]  where he moved to. And we went to Boston and we went all over Massachusetts and that's a conservative
[47:28.640 --> 47:32.720]  place. I'm a law. I was at the time I didn't have dreadlocks. I just had long, filthy hair.
[47:32.800 --> 47:37.200]  And I was wearing a fish t-shirt and like patchwork pants. And I probably either had skate shoes or
[47:37.200 --> 47:41.520]  no shoes. Cause that's how I used to roll. And bro, Massachusetts gave me the, like,
[47:42.160 --> 47:47.680]  it's one big cherry Creek. Like if you're from the cherry Creek is like not all of it, but, uh,
[47:47.680 --> 47:51.920]  a good chunk of it for sure. Yeah. It's very conservative. All of the places. My buddy,
[47:51.920 --> 47:56.960]  Rob took me to felt very, uh, everything was overpriced and the cars were a little nicer
[47:56.960 --> 48:00.560]  than I should be driving. And yeah, I could, I felt out of place at the time, but anyway,
[48:00.560 --> 48:03.200]  shout out to Rob, the dude, bro. I'm glad that you can get yourself some,
[48:03.200 --> 48:05.680]  some legal cannabis here next year. It's going to be dope.
[48:05.680 --> 48:09.920]  Shout out for mass joining the club and bike shut up the bike also Nevada.
[48:11.520 --> 48:15.360]  Now they've got legal casinos, legal prostitution and legal weed.
[48:16.560 --> 48:22.640]  Congratulations, Nevada. That's awesome. Yeah. Hell yeah. Um, and Nevada's law, um,
[48:22.640 --> 48:28.720]  they're rec now, but their medical law really pushed the envelope as far as what's allowed.
[48:28.720 --> 48:33.680]  What's not allowed with reciprocity. They were one of the few places where you could take your
[48:33.680 --> 48:39.600]  med card from any other medical state, walk into a Nevada medical marijuana shop and purchase
[48:40.960 --> 48:45.760]  medical marijuana in Nevada. Um, and like, I can't do that in California with my Colorado card.
[48:45.760 --> 48:51.120]  You can't do that in Colorado with the California card. Nice. Um, reciprocity is rare in Nevada was
[48:51.120 --> 48:57.360]  the first one to step up. So I was not surprised to see them go legal marijuana. Um, a lot of the
[48:57.360 --> 49:04.640]  anti-marijuana money spent in this campaign came from casinos. Um, not necessarily those in Nevada.
[49:05.280 --> 49:12.880]  Um, but that's, uh, one of those anti-marijuana, um, funding points that's common. Um, and that's
[49:12.880 --> 49:19.280]  going to start changing in Nevada now. Why wouldn't they want me to get super blazed and gamble? Um,
[49:20.080 --> 49:22.720]  common wisdom is cause you'd spend more if you were drinking.
[49:23.280 --> 49:30.240]  I guess I wouldn't, I don't go because I can't get blazed and gamble. Yeah. If I can, if I could just
[49:30.240 --> 49:35.520]  safely go to my like Vegas until now, even if there was a place where I could go,
[49:36.320 --> 49:41.680]  like either smoke a joint or take a couple dabs away from the casino floor. Right. Yeah. That's
[49:41.680 --> 49:45.200]  all. I just want to go to my hotel room. I don't want to get a little fucked up. I'm asking for
[49:45.200 --> 49:49.440]  that much. The last time I was in the casino, they kept bringing me a new ashtray, like every four
[49:49.840 --> 49:54.720]  minutes. Um, and fuck all the non-smokers. That was one of our last little, like, we're all going to
[49:54.720 --> 49:58.480]  get cancer and die together. A little strongholds. Dabbing at the slot machine would just get
[49:58.480 --> 50:01.920]  reckless for me because there's that couple of minutes right after you take a dab where the
[50:01.920 --> 50:05.520]  world is like spinning and you're just like, Oh fuck, I don't need to be right at the machine
[50:05.520 --> 50:09.760]  there. I need to check out. That's part of why I go off and dab somewhere. I can just check out
[50:09.760 --> 50:14.480]  what's going on. It's like taking a lunch break. Yep. Just go fucking be somewhere that's not loud
[50:14.480 --> 50:18.160]  and shit happening that you can just fucking shut your brain up. Take a couple dabs.
[50:18.240 --> 50:20.800]  And then you got to slowly reenter. You can't just,
[50:23.360 --> 50:28.560]  I would love to, or if I had a place where I could just go take a couple dabs or smoke a joint
[50:28.560 --> 50:32.560]  and then go back to the tables, I'd actually go back up to Blackhawk and stuff again. Or Vegas
[50:32.560 --> 50:36.400]  would hold a little more interest for me. Right. But as it is now, it's like, yeah, I get to go
[50:36.400 --> 50:42.000]  drive all my drunk friends around. Uh, so that's a nice change. I'm proud of Nevada. And then the
[50:42.480 --> 50:47.280]  last one on the list, the, the maybe list is Maine. And we tease this one a little bit earlier.
[50:47.280 --> 50:54.480]  The state of Maine is currently in a very, very tight race. Um, the anti-marijuana folks in Maine
[50:54.480 --> 50:58.880]  have already sworn to take this one. They're going to, they're going to take it to court and
[50:58.880 --> 51:04.720]  ask for recount, um, and make sure that the votes were tallied correctly. Um, that's step one. And
[51:04.720 --> 51:08.560]  then they'll go from there. Uh, that's how close it is. Cause it's, it's within a, I think it's
[51:08.720 --> 51:16.480]  within 3000 votes total. Um, and the last news report I saw said one of the counties that had
[51:16.480 --> 51:25.520]  gone, um, a majority, no, uh, vote for legalization. They found like another 2,700 ballots at like
[51:25.520 --> 51:30.400]  absentee ballots that might've not been counted. Um, and so there's little things like that,
[51:30.400 --> 51:34.800]  that they're squeezing through and making sure everything gets cleaned up that could put Maine
[51:34.880 --> 51:40.640]  in the no column. Um, anti-legalization people are anti-marijuana. People are already calling
[51:40.640 --> 51:47.120]  Maine a win, um, because the big bad marijuana industry didn't win in a landslide, um, because
[51:47.120 --> 51:51.920]  it's a tight race because they can legally contest it. And as for a recount, they're putting that
[51:51.920 --> 51:56.400]  one in the wind column. Um, unfortunately they're, they're putting it next to Arizona,
[51:56.400 --> 52:00.800]  which belongs in their wind column. Um, legalization got crushed in Arizona.
[52:00.960 --> 52:07.600]  Yeah. Um, lost by a good chunk of the vote. Um, my guess is it had to do specifically with that
[52:07.600 --> 52:12.400]  issue. Um, like where'd you, we just grouped these as, as medical States and rec States,
[52:12.960 --> 52:18.560]  every law, um, in all the States we listed is different. Um, they do the same thing in very,
[52:18.560 --> 52:25.840]  very different ways. Um, and the success of the vote often depends on the nuances there. Um,
[52:26.000 --> 52:31.040]  had Colorado's amendment 64 been worded differently, might not have passed. Right. Um,
[52:31.040 --> 52:35.520]  same thing with all the votes last night. Um, and I think that's part of what we're seeing in
[52:35.520 --> 52:42.240]  Arizona. They also had a shitload of money thrown at their anti-legalization campaign. Um,
[52:42.960 --> 52:47.120]  I want to say half a million from discounts higher in 2 million from Sheldon Adelson.
[52:48.160 --> 52:53.040]  Yeah, guys, I usually don't, uh, I do end up with a lot of people that say,
[52:53.200 --> 52:58.320]  guys, I usually don't, uh, I do endorse companies. I don't dis endorse companies very often. Other
[52:58.320 --> 53:03.680]  than this fucking headphone amp, we've bashed this headphone amp from I've got one that works.
[53:03.680 --> 53:08.560]  Now this one is a lot. I'm not going to curse it. Nevermind. But discount tire, uh, can eat my ass.
[53:08.560 --> 53:12.160]  Uh, discount tire is a place where you go to get discount tires, just pay regular price for
[53:12.160 --> 53:14.720]  fucking tires. Cause the discount tire isn't giving you a discount anyway. They just put
[53:14.720 --> 53:19.120]  the word discount in there to trick you. They contributed heavily to keeping cannabis illegal.
[53:20.080 --> 53:23.280]  They make tires. Why do they give a shit if cannabis is illegal or not?
[53:23.280 --> 53:29.440]  If you, if, uh, no, for this, for everybody, um, keep an eye out for who supports what,
[53:30.320 --> 53:37.040]  um, you'll be shocked how many companies that you spend money out money at actively take your money,
[53:37.760 --> 53:43.520]  um, shake your hand, turn around and spend the money you just put in their pocket against you.
[53:44.480 --> 53:51.760]  Um, here locally, we had a number of companies that the marijuana industry was actively
[53:51.760 --> 53:57.600]  supporting, like by choice, kind of as a group that is, it turns out have been actively trying
[53:57.600 --> 54:05.120]  to dismantle us. Um, and so industry wide, there's been shifts in who we advertise with here,
[54:05.680 --> 54:10.000]  um, who we use for trash service here, who we use for construction work here,
[54:10.560 --> 54:16.560]  um, where we fucking shop for meat. Um, there's like, I mean, a couple of people came out actively
[54:16.560 --> 54:23.840]  against us and I mean, elections have consequences. Your, your public support and denouncement of
[54:23.840 --> 54:31.040]  things have consequences. And this is true in your area as well. Listeners pay attention to
[54:31.040 --> 54:39.280]  politics. This stuff affects everything you do. Um, so we've got all of these States that just
[54:39.280 --> 54:46.000]  went wreck in medical, bringing our national total to eight full legal medical or legal marijuana
[54:46.000 --> 54:51.680]  States where any adult can buy marijuana if they're over 21 in a licensed and regulated store,
[54:52.320 --> 55:01.040]  eight legal States and 28 medical marijuana States. Um, one in five Americans lives in an
[55:01.040 --> 55:07.280]  area where they can buy marijuana legally. Um, it's like three and five when you do the medical.
[55:08.160 --> 55:16.080]  Um, and now some of that 28 is CBD only oil laws in places like Utah. But I mean, with numbers like
[55:16.080 --> 55:22.720]  that, those give me hope for our national, our national news. Um, because as all of you know now,
[55:22.720 --> 55:29.440]  um, or have had the chance to learn, uh, Trump is now our president or our president elect. He'll
[55:29.440 --> 55:37.600]  take over in January. Um, and this election also gave control of the Senate to the GOP and the
[55:37.600 --> 55:45.520]  house of representatives to the GOP. Um, and in all likelihood that group of people will be replacing
[55:45.520 --> 55:52.240]  three Supreme court justices in the next four years. So the shape of American politics, that
[55:52.240 --> 56:00.160]  landscape is all shifting drastically under our feet. Um, one of the reasons president Obama wasn't
[56:00.160 --> 56:07.200]  able to do a lot of the things he had campaigned on trying to do was because the opposition party,
[56:07.200 --> 56:12.720]  the Republicans held a large majorities in either the house or the Senate during his presidency.
[56:13.360 --> 56:18.320]  So when the president wanted to do something, the opposition party would make it as hard as possible.
[56:18.960 --> 56:23.520]  Um, that's not going to be true for president Trump, at least for the first two years.
[56:23.520 --> 56:30.720]  He's got, um, party majority in all of government, um, which means Trump want to eat. Trump probably
[56:30.720 --> 56:39.280]  get to do. He, um, for marijuana legalization that, uh, before last night, the picture was a lot darker,
[56:40.000 --> 56:45.120]  um, on the campaign trail, some of, uh, president elect Trump.
[56:45.520 --> 56:51.520]  Sorry, listeners, if you're a conservative, that's just saying that does weird things in my brain.
[56:52.240 --> 57:01.040]  Um, but president elect Trump, um, has spent a lot of time working very closely with some strong
[57:01.040 --> 57:07.200]  prohibitionist politicians. Um, Chris Christie is a big Trump supporter has been on the campaign
[57:07.200 --> 57:11.600]  campaign trail, stopping for Trump since he dropped out of the presidential race himself.
[57:12.240 --> 57:16.640]  Um, and he was one of the people that was promising to send the army to shut us down on day one.
[57:17.440 --> 57:23.520]  Um, attorney general down, meaning the legal medical, the legal marijuana industry period,
[57:24.080 --> 57:32.320]  um, from the federal government can, um, basically immediately, um, void the coal
[57:33.440 --> 57:40.000]  memo, um, and the Ogden memo and begin doing what's necessary to enforce the controlled
[57:40.000 --> 57:47.200]  substances act, um, call Colorado up and say, Hey, either you stop all this legal marijuana
[57:47.200 --> 57:52.160]  bullshit, or we yank all your road funding. Um, Colorado doesn't survive without federal
[57:52.160 --> 57:57.760]  dollars. No state does. Yeah. Um, that's how they got a coast to coast alcohol laws in line.
[57:58.400 --> 58:04.560]  Um, and that's been the threat all along is states have kind of, uh, crafted their own
[58:04.560 --> 58:09.520]  marijuana industries in their own way. Um, like we've been doing for the last 20 years now,
[58:10.160 --> 58:17.280]  um, that at any point someone in, in federal government would yank that leash and the entire
[58:17.280 --> 58:23.440]  industry we've built would crumble back into the black market. Um, and honestly,
[58:23.440 --> 58:29.760]  with eight legal States, 28 medical States and an election last night where, um, eight of nine
[58:30.320 --> 58:38.800]  succeeded, um, that, that says a lot. We had Republicans and Democrats turn out in big
[58:38.800 --> 58:46.480]  numbers last night and vote for legalization. Um, both parties were talking about whoever gets
[58:46.480 --> 58:52.320]  elected job. One is trying to bring the nation back together, try to heal some of the divisiveness.
[58:53.040 --> 59:01.040]  And this is an issue that we're now agreeing on as a majority population, not just the majority
[59:01.040 --> 59:05.520]  of Democrats, not just the majority of Republicans, not just the majority of young people
[59:05.520 --> 59:12.400]  or black people or Hispanic people, but the majority of Americans agree on now. Um, I think
[59:12.400 --> 59:19.440]  it would be incredibly costly for a future Trump administration to, to really go after legal
[59:19.440 --> 59:24.560]  marijuana at this point. There's just too much support coast to coast now had last night's
[59:24.560 --> 59:31.280]  election had one state join rec and maybe to join medical that mandate isn't there.
[59:32.240 --> 59:39.680]  Like I, I keep coming back to every vote really counts. Um, I mean, when, when we really digest
[59:39.680 --> 59:47.040]  what happened on Tuesday, that's going to be what's clear is that if you're not participating
[59:47.120 --> 59:51.680]  in this, you're fucked. Yeah. The people that disagree with you get to make those decisions.
[59:52.400 --> 01:00:01.040]  Um, and I mean, where we go from here is, is kind of anyone's guess. Um, what happened starting in
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:08.880]  January? I mean, the D the difference between president elect Trump on the campaign trail
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:16.400]  and in last night's concession speech was night and day. Um, that speech alone changed
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:26.320]  the conversation nationally from, Oh fuck, who's got a good bunker. Um, to maybe we all survive
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:30.800]  this. I mean, literally in one speech and a lot of the national media,
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:34.160]  do you think somebody grabbed him by the collar and sat him down and was like,
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:42.320]  it's clear that for the last couple of weeks, several important people have, have been in,
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:48.800]  in conversations with Donald Trump explaining that president of the United States isn't a game.
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:55.600]  It isn't a joke. It isn't funny. Uh, real repercussions, billions of lives.
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:02.880]  We just gave who's accurate. Someone who's accurate, accurately been described as orange
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:11.200]  Hitler, all of our nuclear launch codes that's happening in the next couple of weeks. Um,
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:17.040]  I mean, immediately with the, when the election results came in last night,
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:22.880]  it like 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock at night when we knew, okay, Hillary lost Donald Trump one,
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:29.120]  she's calling him to concede the race. This is real international stock markets all over the
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:34.720]  world started crashing. Um, an hour and a half later, he made his concession speech in the crash
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:41.600]  stopped. Wow. The world is watching. One of the, one of the things that we forget is that
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:50.560]  planet earth is a big idea. It's a very small place right now. We're 20 hours apart from every
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:56.800]  human on earth at most. That means in 20 hours, the person that's furthest away on this planet
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:00.880]  from wherever you are right now can be shaking your hand where you're standing.
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:10.240]  It's a very, very small place. We are a leader in every way globally. And when we give the keys
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:18.000]  to a reality TV show, contestant or host or whatever, the world takes notice. And it's
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:24.560]  clear that someone's been in his, his ear for weeks emphasizing this, um, because his, his
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:30.000]  entire demeanor was different last night. And, and even his supporters were running him to run
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:36.720]  out on stage and kick the podium down and be like, America, like grab bricks, people on some mortar.
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:41.440]  We're going to start now. Like that's what people were expecting. And when it didn't happen and he
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:47.280]  came off as presidential, the entire world noticed, uh, the entire world noticed nine
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:54.000]  States voting on marijuana last night. Other nations are looking at legalizing marijuana
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.880]  from the government down because they see what's happening in the United States.
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:08.560]  They see the headache of voter put forth value ballot efforts, um, and how hard it is to regulate
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:15.760]  in tax, a voter initiative law, rather than craft a legalization law from the ground up that works
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:20.800]  well in the system they've already got in place, um, places like Uruguay, they're not waiting for
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:26.640]  the voters. Um, and there's a couple other countries that were watching Florida last
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:32.080]  night. They were watching California last night. They're, they're watching main now in thinking,
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:38.400]  we signed the same conventions, the United States did that prohibit us from legalizing marijuana.
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:47.200]  These laws have been just as destructive here as they are there. Our, our, our people here
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:53.600]  deserve the same opportunity to be free of the problems these laws cause that the people in
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:04:00.160]  Colorado do. And so they're doing it themselves, um, because elections matter, elections have
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:07.760]  consequences. Um, and if you can do this smartly, um, from the top down, it can go a little smoother.
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:13.120]  Um, part of the reason this process is so ugly and so messy and so fucking slow.
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:18.800]  I'm sorry for cussing so much tonight guys. Crazy. Wow. It's been fucking crazy. I'm so proud of
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:24.480]  myself that I haven't thrown anything in the last 48 hours. Um, part of that's because I'm always
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:32.800]  holding a rig, but still, um, I mean, it's, it's been really, really stressful and, and honestly,
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:39.200]  with what we're left looking at right now, where, where we go from here is anyone's guess. Um, a
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:44.720]  lot of where we go from here is totally up to Donald Trump. Um, cause we honestly, honestly,
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:51.680]  God just gave that man the driver's seat of the planet. Um, and where he takes us is really
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:56.960]  anyone's guess. Um, I mean, it's pretty clear if you've been paying attention to reality,
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:04.560]  a lot of his campaign promises are not at all realistic or feasible. They're bigly crazy. Yes.
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:09.520]  It's sort of like him promising that if we elected him, aliens would finally introduce themselves.
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:17.280]  Um, but he's still going to be president for four years. He's still going to appoint a cabinet.
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:21.600]  He's still going to replace Supreme court justices. He's going to do something. He's
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:29.360]  going to govern. Um, does he decide to, to yank our federal funding until all 50 States fall back
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:34.480]  in line with prohibition? Um, does he finally crack the whip and say it's time to legalize
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:40.000]  nationally or at least let the States do it? Uh, I mean, literally every decision is a fucking
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:46.880]  coin flip at this point. No one knows. Um, we hope that somebody screaming, look, look how popular it
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:51.840]  is. It did better than almost every candidate on the ballot. You can't come out strongly against
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:58.720]  marijuana. It would kill you. Um, but who knows? Um, he could be sitting down with Chris Christie
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:02.320]  right now, having a Scotch and a Prozac talking about how they're going to round up all the
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:08.160]  hippies. Um, one of the really scary things that happened last night was private prison stocks
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:15.760]  skyrocketed. Yep. Jeff's eyebrow just went through the top of his head. I've been joking for days
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:21.600]  now that I hope me and all my friends ended up in the same FEMA camps. Yep. Um, FEMA camps,
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:26.960]  very unlikely. That was one of the more fun rumors about Obama's presidency. Um, but, uh,
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:34.480]  I mean, it's a possibility. Yeah. I'm the type of people that those people are that they do not
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:40.640]  like. Well, it's a hundred percent possible that a new administration goes a very different
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:47.840]  direction. Um, then the Obama administration has gone and there's a reason legalization advocates
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:53.600]  of have pushed the Obama administration as hard as they have, um, for more on legalization.
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:59.840]  Um, every chance we've gotten, we've begged for movement and we've gotten a little, but very,
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:04.320]  very little. Um, and because we've only gotten a little bit of movement federally,
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:10.560]  the next administration can do whatever they want. They can put an end to all of this. Um,
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:19.280]  with a couple of meetings, a strategy and like 35 phone calls, um, or a press release,
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:25.200]  um, is really all it would take. Yeah. Um, sure. There would be a lot of kicking,
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:30.080]  there'd be a lot of screaming, there'd be a lot of hell no, we won't go. Um, but in the end,
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:38.560]  you're talking about stoners versus drones. Um, the way to change the laws is to participate in
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:44.640]  the system and vote. Right. Um, and hopefully the people that are about to take power caught
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:50.160]  the mandate from last night and we're paying attention. Um, the only group of people that
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:55.920]  are really happy right now, um, that I see in my social media feeds are the marijuana people. Yeah.
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:08:01.040]  The hardcore marijuana people know that marijuana had a huge night last night. Um,
[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:05.760]  liberals are disappointed and confused. Conservatives are really confused and kind of
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:13.040]  shocked. Um, stoners are happy, but I honestly think that it's a little early to be super happy.
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:20.480]  Um, for those of you in States that just passed either medical or rec, get involved immediately,
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:28.240]  get to city council, um, get on your computer when you hear this and figure out what area you live in,
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:31.840]  whether it's governed by a city council or a County commission or whatever,
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:37.280]  figure out when those meetings are and start going, figure out when your state legislature
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:42.080]  meets and what they're talking about. And if you can attend those meetings, because if your state,
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:46.080]  like if you're in California right now, those rules are just being written.
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:50.960]  All of those cities that have been passing marijuana vans, leading bands leading up into the
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:58.160]  election, we're doing so that they had time to write rules for, um, 64 so that they could pick
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:04.320]  the zoning and pick the buffer distances and pick the tax numbers. You need to be participating in
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:10.480]  those hearings. If you want to, if you want any kind of saying it, otherwise the people who do
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:18.320]  care are going to get what they want in those laws. Just go put your face in that mix. Go be
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:22.800]  seen humans, no matter what your job, if you're a councilman, if you're a zoning commissioner,
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:27.680]  if you make the laws, if you're the judge, if you go to whatever meeting it is at the end of the
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:32.000]  meeting, there's always that 15 minutes where everybody just stands around and bullshits.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.800]  Maybe if you're the guy like Mike, that goes to every single city council meeting that he can,
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:41.520]  maybe one of the guys that are running that is on the fence about how they feel about you.
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:45.680]  Maybe they'll actually walk up and actually speak to you because they just want someone to talk to
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:49.440]  for that next 10 minutes till they have to go to the next meeting. They want to blend in like
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:53.040]  everyone else. They don't want to seem like a dick and it's socially acceptable to just walk
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:58.400]  up and talk to the other guy at that council meeting. You may end up putting the right bug
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:03.040]  in his ear. He may talk to you and realize, man, that guy is six, five with dreadlocks and his eyes
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:07.600]  are red and he wears a red, golden green t-shirt every day. But when I spoke to him, he was
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:11.200]  intelligent. He sounded like he knew what he was talking about. Maybe I'm not so afraid of these
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:15.200]  cannabis guys because that guy's compassionate. And that guy's telling me about his friend with
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:19.440]  cancer that he's helping take care of with cannabis. You might spark something in somebody
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:24.800]  and you may accidentally put them on your team. I, uh, I was at a couple of different watch parties
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:30.720]  on election night. And, uh, when I stopped by the democratic watch party, um, one of our local
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:36.320]  representatives in the city was asking me, um, if I thought eight stores would be enough to
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:42.720]  dedicate, um, a hard stream of revenue revenue to law enforcement. Um, and so I quickly turned
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:47.520]  the conversation into production facilities that we already allow or where you want that money to
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:51.600]  come from, um, because it's a more stable revenue source. And it was just a quick two minute
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:56.560]  conversation, but it was somebody in city government who knew me from these meetings
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:02.320]  who just, they were bored at a party. And so they came wandering over to me to chat for five minutes.
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:07.760]  Yep. And so now when they're looking at the budget next week and they see that our two,
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:13.200]  our two ballot questions about more money for law enforcement failed, um, they've got an option that
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:17.440]  they might be able to fill some of that hole with now that might not have been on the table before.
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:22.880]  Um, and honestly, that's down the road for the States that just voted on it. Um,
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:29.120]  if you live in California or Massachusetts or Nevada right now, your city or your County is
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:35.280]  talking about, or is about to be talking about zoning rules, what type of land and what type
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:40.800]  of areas in our community do we want to allow production facilities? We want to allow grows
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:47.120]  or extraction labs or stores. How many feet from school should they be? Um, what kind of labeling
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:52.000]  should we require? What kind of testing should we require? And the people that are about to make
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:58.080]  those decisions don't have a fucking clue about any of this. They know cannabis is a weed. They
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:02.080]  know that it needs water and sunlight to grow. And then I guess you can grow it under lights
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:08.880]  and that it's probably bad for your brain. And that's all they know. Yep. And if you don't show
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:15.600]  up to these meetings and, and bring reality to them, they're never going to see it. They're
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:21.600]  going to pass rules to regulate what's in their head. Um, and you're going to get stuck with some
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:28.400]  of the rules that we get and you're left explaining them to people. Um, with just, it's just a crazy
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:34.320]  rule that we follow. Um, like, why do we have to bleach our trash? It's just one of those things
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:38.880]  is bleach good for the environment. Fuck it. It's a rule. So let me talk about that one.
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:46.240]  Oh, I ran a big grow. We had over a hundred lights and people would climb a barbed wire fence. Well,
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:50.960]  this is a statewide rule because the legislature kind of saw this. They would claim, Oh, they would
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:55.040]  put carpets old school style. Like we used to do back in the day, throw a carpet over the barbed
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:13:00.880]  wire fence, graffiti style, uh, throw the carpet over the fence, jump the fence, and then climb
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:06.160]  up a big pole above the trash can and jump off this pole through the plate. We had plastic trash
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:10.560]  can lids, the giant dumpster. They weren't plastic. They were that thick, like that real hard, heavy
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:14.960]  plastic. Yeah. Yeah. And they would smash their bodies through it. And then they'd get in there
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:21.760]  and steal our trash bags, which was why would we throw away weed? We didn't do that. It was sticks
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:27.200]  and stems and mainly like office trash. We had an office. There was a bathroom. There was bathroom
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:32.480]  trash. There was Thai food trash. Cause I ate lunch there. Like the people breaking into marijuana
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:38.960]  dump business dumpsters don't know about the rules. Eventually we had to, eventually we had to
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:44.880]  put a stainless steel to these lids were so heavy that I had to get on a chair to lift them up
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:49.520]  because I couldn't get enough leverage from the one that they were so heavy. And they, they found a
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:54.560]  way to cut the poles, the hinges off of the ends now to get into that trash can. And they're on
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:57.840]  camera doing it. They've been pulled over and busted. It's the same guy that does it repeatedly.
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:02.960]  But anyway, you guys, I'm off on a crazy rant. We've got a lot of weird rules here, mainly because
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:09.360]  when it came time to pass these rules to write a lot of them, the marijuana community was busy
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:14.320]  scrambling, trying to start a business before the rules got in place so that they could open it
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:20.080]  their way at their location and hopefully get grandfathered in later when rules finally did
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:27.040]  get passed. The grandfather shit didn't work out too well for a lot of us. Did it? At one point
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:35.920]  we had over a thousand marijuana retail locations in Colorado. And that was the week before real
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:42.160]  regulations came down the pipe for the first time. At the same time, that first regulation set hit
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:48.320]  the feds came in and said, all right, any of you that aren't a thousand feet from the school,
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:52.720]  and we're going to make that thousand feet as long as possible.
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:59.840]  Um, like if, if there's the grand Canyon between me and you, it doesn't matter. Um, if we're only
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:05.680]  995 feet apart at the opposite sides of the great Canyon, it's as the crow flies is what they called
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:09.520]  it. Well, it used to be by the foot. And then they recently changed it. And that fucked a lot of
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:14.080]  people. Um, yeah. When they changed that rule, like a third of our shops had to move or close down
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:21.520]  and all the shops that were near like 980 feet from whatever school the feds said, you have to
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:29.440]  close. And that was the only big closure of shops we had in Colorado. Um, the, the feds closed down
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:36.480]  about 50 of them for being too close to schools. And then the rules being put in place closed
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:43.600]  almost 500. Um, and since then, like another 150 have dropped out of the running because it's,
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:48.960]  it's just too much of a headache. What really, uh, what bothered me about a lot of the rulemaking was
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:56.880]  it created a scenario where guys like, uh, okay, I can use Scott reaches an example because he's
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:01.760]  gone full circle back in the day, Scott reach from rare, rare dankness opened up a dispensary.
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:06.880]  I think it was called white mountain medicine. That dispensary was the fucking example. That's
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:10.960]  what dispensaries should have been back then. But that was the wild, wild West when there weren't
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:16.480]  any rules. Uh, they were what's called vertically integrated before vertical integration was a thing.
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:20.720]  They were growing everything. They were selling, they were producing it all. They were packaging
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:25.200]  it. Everything was happening in house. It was all like a one man show. Basically it was Scott and a
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:29.760]  couple of homies. And then they started implementing all these new systems, all these new rules,
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:33.920]  all these new laws. And the guys that were putting their heart into the grow, these guys were
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:38.000]  sleeping in the grow. You know what I mean? They had cots between the rows of plants where these
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.920]  guys would take a nap. When the lights went off for the 12, 12 cycle, they'd sleep in there.
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:45.360]  They'd wake up and sneak out and go in the other room and work on that. After they had a nap,
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:50.960]  they were killing it. But all the new rules forced cameras and so much other bullshit that
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:56.000]  they couldn't afford. And so the guys with heart, they would love these plants got forced out. And
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:02.480]  the guys that own car dealerships and own whatever other random business that it went to business
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:07.200]  school and just saw an opportunity in Colorado, they came in and they're like, well, I got money
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:11.200]  and they bought shit up. And now, unfortunately, a lot of those types of folks are who are running
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:18.160]  the cannabis industry and the heart got squeezed out. There's still a weird, uh, lack of quality
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:23.040]  in large portions of the legal market here that lets me, uh, let me, let me wrap up. Cause I want
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:28.240]  to, I started with Scott reach. Uh, I got to give Scott a shout out and finish that. Now Scott owns
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:32.880]  the most high tech, most sophisticated, most impressive fucking grow facility in the state
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:38.240]  of Colorado that I've ever seen. And he is now producing once again, some of the best quality
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:44.880]  cannabis in a very large scale. And it's available for a retail purchase. Uh, he does the wholesale
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:48.720]  thing. So it ends up in dispensaries. So he's back at it now. I just had to go. He went full
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:53.840]  circle. I'm starting to see a lot, a lot more of the, the people who were doing it from their heart,
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:18:02.000]  um, finally getting up and running again, but for a year and a half, two years, three years,
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:08.960]  all of them have been looking for money. Um, and the people running the big production facilities
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:15.280]  are the people that have money and not the people that have talent. Um, and that's led to a lot of
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:22.800]  like, wow, solid C plus, right. Um, I had a million dollar loan. Oh man. Um, I had somebody like
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:31.200]  excitedly show me some bud that was 2.2% THC, 7.7% CBD. Like excitedly, like this is on our
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:36.960]  shelf now, bro. And I kind of looked at him and he kind of looked at me and then he was like,
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:42.160]  but why aren't you excited? You, you, you've been asking for CBD flower for a while now. And I was
[01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:48.320]  like, yeah, that, that ain't it though. Like I got more CBD, like stuck to my oil slick.
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:55.920]  Um, sorry. Like I hate to, I hate to brush your bubble, but get up above 10, get closer to 15.
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:19:04.800]  Um, if you've got passion and talent and skill producing marijuana, you know, what quality is,
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:10.320]  um, you've got a passion for helping share your love of marijuana with other people.
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:15.840]  Um, it's really time to bite the bullet and start spending Mondays at city council.
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:22.800]  Um, you're going to hate it. It's going to take you two years, um, of really boring meetings
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:28.240]  that don't have anything to do with marijuana. And I've sat through that long public testimony
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:32.640]  sessions where one person gets up and said, marijuana is the devil's lettuce. And it's
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:36.880]  going to make everybody commit suicide. And then somebody gets up and say, no,
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:40.880]  we're going to pave the streets with gold. And everybody's going to get too cute redheads to go
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:46.800]  home with. Um, and you just argue back and forth all night long, but if you don't go
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:52.800]  and there isn't someone there to make rational arguments to the people that finally make these
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:57.520]  decisions in your area, uh, you're going to wake up one morning and it's going to be a two and a
[01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:02.160]  half hour drive to the pot store. And you're going to have done that to yourself. When you get to
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:07.360]  that pot store, that's two and a half hours away. It's going to be mediocre quality and twice as
[01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:11.120]  expensive as your old dealer back home purchase limits. So that you have to do it once a damn
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:15.440]  week instead of once a month. Yep. And it's going to be your fault for skipping out on these meetings
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:22.880]  and for hoping that somebody else goes down and fights for you. Um, and that's, I mean, that's my
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:26.560]  takeaway from this election is you got to participate. Yes. Participate. If you did not
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:30.160]  vote in this election, you cannot bitch about anything for the next four years. That's something
[01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:34.560]  that I want to say, Mike, we've been going for a long time. So let's, uh, let's wrap it up. If you
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:38.480]  got any final words, one last thing, do it. That's what I'm giving you the chance for buddy with rate
[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:45.200]  most political issues we're talking about changing what is a little bit,
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:51.840]  um, we're going to raise the, the age or whatever from this to that. It's just a little tiny
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:57.120]  insignificant change. Uh, we're going to give people five more years if they commit whatever
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:21:03.840]  crime, um, most of what we're changing is already laid out when it comes to stuff like marijuana
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:14.000]  legalization, we're changing to a whole new system. Nothing is laid out. Um, when you're
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:21.920]  crafting stuff for people to vote on how you write the issue matters. Once it's passed in the law in
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:28.720]  your state and it passes by popular vote, um, it, that feels like the win. Um, and it's not,
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:35.280]  that's getting invited to the game. Um, it just feels like a win and don't get me wrong. Voting
[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:41.840]  on legalization as a state is amazing. I remember that feeling in Colorado. Um, I was thinking about
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:48.480]  it a lot last night actually, but, uh, it's very much the beginning of the game. Uh, you have not
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:55.200]  won yet. Um, right now, Oregon, I'm seeing that a huge number of towns, cities, and counties,
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:22:02.960]  uh, banned rec sales. Um, some of those are doing it, um, to wait and see. Some of them are doing
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:06.720]  it because they fucking hate marijuana and they don't understand why their state legalized it.
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:11.440]  Um, some of them are doing it because they want a little more time to finish crafting the rules,
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:17.120]  but all of them are doing it because not enough pro marijuana people are showing up to meetings
[01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:22.640]  and voicing their support, um, for allowing legal marijuana, the legal marijuana industry in their
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:28.480]  area. Um, Oregon's a big legalization state. They've been on the list for a minute now. Um,
[01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:33.920]  and they, they, uh, they don't have nearly the access we do here. And part of that's because
[01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:37.920]  they don't have the community that we have here. They don't have the activists that we have here
[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:44.320]  that are fighting for it. Um, and for places like Massachusetts, Nevada, Maine, Florida,
[01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:49.360]  North Dakota, Arkansas, you guys need to start hitting those meetings. You need to figure out
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:55.440]  how these rules get made in your area. Um, it's going to take a lot of time. I know a lot of you
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:23:01.680]  should be at work and don't have time to dedicate to this. Um, but that's kind of how I became me.
[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:08.000]  I was the guy that didn't have work on Monday nights. I was the guy who already had a background
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:13.920]  in law and politics and was willing to bite the bullet and go to a couple of these meetings.
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:21.040]  That was like eight years ago. I like, it's a long fight in it to get to, to get wherever you
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:26.160]  are, to where we are now in Colorado. It's going to take people like me willing to step up and go
[01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:33.360]  to the meetings. Um, I'm happy for you guys to hit me up on social media, ask me for tips and tricks.
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:38.640]  If you're having trouble finding something out, I'm happy to help you help you research it. Um,
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:42.880]  you just got to let me know. Yeah. And more importantly, you've got to get out there and do
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:47.840]  it. How can they reach you? Uh, you can, uh, the easiest way honestly is through Facebook.
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:53.760]  Um, if you send a message to Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws, um, that will get to me, um, that
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:24:00.800]  will get, that will get to my pocket with a nice notification. Um, you can tweet me at Nemo punk 15.
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:08.560]  Um, mainly my Twitter was to annoy prohibitionists online, and I have officially been blocked by all
[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:14.800]  of them. Um, so mainly I just use that for sharing news stories with, um, the little Twitter verse
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:20.800]  troll from your heart. Yeah. Troll from your heart, bro. Uh, Portland for positive impact rules.
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:28.400]  Um, but, uh, yeah, you can get me on either of those and I'm happy to answer all your questions.
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:31.600]  I think that last dab just kicked in. Cause I looked down at your phone and I was like,
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:35.200]  yeah, we should listen to some music. I know I'm just getting a song lined up for the end
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:40.960]  of the podcast. Had nothing to do with any of that. All right, folks. This has been our election
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:46.400]  episode. I hope we hit what you were hoping for us to hit. If we didn't, that's what emailing Jeff
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:50.960]  is all about. Yes. Yes. If you want to email me, if you want more details, I think we went for an
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:54.880]  hour and a half here. So I hope we covered everything. Y'all sorry for the rambling.
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:58.400]  You're like, I appreciate it. I love the content. I love that when you come and be on the podcast,
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:01.280]  I love it. When you ramble, you guys send me an email. If you want to, if you want to hear more
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:04.880]  about this election, if you want to hear anything about cannabis, we talked about this a minute ago,
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:08.560]  my email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com. I would love to hear from you.
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:15.520]  The future is, let's see what happens. I'm excited. It's so wide open. I don't mean to
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:20.880]  paint a bleak picture. I'm ready for whatever comes. I've been bored anyway. I like change and
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:25.040]  excitement. Let's see what goes on. This is going to be interesting. I'm excited to experience the
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:29.680]  future with you. Whatever happens, it's been fun. I love you guys. Thanks for listening.
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:34.320]  Yeah. Oh yeah. You got to go to iTunes. That's what you got to do. Go to iTunes. It would be
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:37.920]  cool now. If you go to, well, Stitcher sucks because it's hard to leave reviews on Stitcher,
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:41.760]  but iTunes, you can go to iTunes. You can go to the iTunes store. You can search for the Grow
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:46.080]  From Your Heart podcast. And then you can, yeah, I'll turn your mic down so you can take a dab and
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:50.560]  cough. Search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast. Find the podcast. You got to scroll all the way to
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:55.200]  the bottom. Click on the little icon. Go to the reviews and ratings. It's rating and reviews. Go
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:26:00.960]  there. So far I've got like 36 positive reviews was the last time I looked, but go there. Give me
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:05.040]  some stars. You've got the option to give me one through five stars. I am a five star general. I
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:08.480]  would appreciate if you click on five stars. I'm not begging for five. It feels shitty to ask you
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:12.960]  for five. Give me what you feel I deserve. But I mean, I'm giving you, you know, go ahead, Mike.
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:17.680]  Your mic's back on. Five stars. And man, I think he earned it. He's choking and trying to hype up
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:22.240]  the show at the same time. I appreciate it. So throw us some stars. But the best part is type
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:26.080]  in the comment. Let me know what you think about the show. If you love the show, type it in there.
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:28.880]  Let me know what you think. If you hate the show, type it in there. Let me know what you think. If
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:33.200]  you think I should go fuck myself, tell me. I'll read it on the air. I will read your comments on
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:37.920]  a future episode. Please don't troll me too hard, but I look forward to what you do type in there.
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:42.400]  That's going to be a whole lot of fun. I think that's all I've got for you. Hey, I'm almost at
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:46.800]  10,000 followers on Instagram. I would like it if you help me get to 10,000 followers. My Instagram
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:51.040]  account is irie underscore genetics. That would be awesome. Also, don't forget to check out my
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:56.880]  friends at thedankteam.com. That's all I've got for you. Huge, huge shout out. I know you've heard
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:02.400]  enough, but huge, gigantic thumbs up, cheesy face, smiled, shout out to everyone who voted.
[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:07.040]  Thanks for participating. Mike needs his mic turned on. Seriously, y'all, thanks for voting. I know
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:12.720]  a lot of people voted for a lot of different issues. It matters that everybody got out and
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:19.520]  voted. Thank you. Be ready for the next election. I know places around the US that are voting again
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:25.600]  in like four months. No, I don't want to start seeing political ads again in two and a half
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:31.680]  years. It's small local stuff like county city election stuff, but there's always something
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:37.040]  going on. If nothing else in your area, you will have a midterm election in two years.
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:42.480]  Make sure your friends and family are registered. Make sure you're talking about the stuff that's
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:46.080]  going to be on the ballot. Make sure your mom's registered to vote. Goddamn, my mom did not vote.
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:48.720]  I'm disappointed in that lady. Sorry, mom. I still love you, mom. Sorry for getting me to say that.
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:52.960]  You got to have the people in your life registered to vote. I drove an hour and a half each way for
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:58.480]  two ballots to make sure that two people got their ballots, got a chance to fill them out,
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:02.080]  and then I drove them to a drop box for them. That's awesome. Yep. Just to make sure that they
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:06.320]  had a chance to vote. I wasn't there because they were voting one way or another on any issue. I
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:11.600]  wanted to make sure they got the chance. It's important that everybody gets that chance,
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:15.440]  and you should exercise that right, people. Exercise your rights. You don't have to only
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:18.400]  exercise the right to remain silent. You got other rights too, guys. All right, guys, we're
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:21.840]  going to wrap up the podcast. We've been going for a long time. I got to piss like you would not
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:24.800]  believe. I'm over here wiggling around in my chair. It's been an hour and a half. I usually
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:29.280]  brag about my podcast bladder. We have found my limit. We hammered this one. All right. Thanks
[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:32.240]  for sticking with us, y'all. Mike, thanks for hanging out. You guys, make sure you follow Mike
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:35.440]  on social media. Make sure you follow me on the social media. Big shout out to my ninja Spence,
[01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:38.880]  and until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:29:48.710 --> 01:31:01.980]  It's the end of the world! It's the end of the world! It's the end of the world!
[01:31:14.940 --> 01:31:42.080]  It's the end of the world as we know it
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:47.060]  It's the end of the world as we know it
[01:31:47.060 --> 01:31:51.800]  It's the end of the world as we know it
[01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:56.540]  I feel fine
[01:31:56.540 --> 01:32:01.020]  It's the end of the world as we know it
[01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:05.760]  It's the end of the world as we know it
[01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:27.120]  It's the end of the line
