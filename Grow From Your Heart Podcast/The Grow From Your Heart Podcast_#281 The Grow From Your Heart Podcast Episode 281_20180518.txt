[00:17.020 --> 00:21.500]  Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis Community. It's time for episode number 281 of the
[00:21.500 --> 00:25.300]  Grow From Your Heart podcast. You're a source for cannabis news, education, and
[00:25.300 --> 00:28.660]  conversation. That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional
[00:28.660 --> 00:32.380]  grower, if you're a new smoker, or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis
[00:32.380 --> 00:35.340]  activist, or even someone who is just curious about the current state of
[00:35.340 --> 00:40.420]  cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you. I'm your host, my friends call
[00:40.420 --> 00:44.100]  me Ross DeJeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me. As always, I need to
[00:44.100 --> 00:47.020]  send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band for
[00:47.020 --> 00:51.340]  letting me use their music on my podcast. Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire
[00:51.340 --> 00:57.160]  Mystic Roots crew. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show. Today I am smoking
[00:57.160 --> 01:01.740]  on some Garden of Weden Clementine. That's right, our friends at the Garden
[01:01.740 --> 01:07.060]  of Weden have got their products on store shelves. I went to Doctor's Orders
[01:07.060 --> 01:11.100]  on the south side of Pueblo, it's a Doctor's Orders STEM beach, and I picked
[01:11.100 --> 01:15.820]  myself up some Clementine Live Resin. Let's see, it's actually Clementine Live
[01:15.820 --> 01:21.020]  Sugar, and I've got some Clementine Batter, and I've got some Sour Diesel
[01:21.020 --> 01:24.700]  Batter. They've got a really cool Garden of Weden logo on the bottle. It's got a
[01:24.700 --> 01:30.700]  nice Clementine description, 739 milligrams per gram. This one's got some
[01:30.700 --> 01:34.740]  CBD in it, I did not realize that. That's pretty cool. And then it's got some info,
[01:34.740 --> 01:37.260]  and then it says GardenofWeden.com, and then their Instagram,
[01:37.260 --> 01:40.540]  at Garden of Weden. Pretty cool packaging. Then you open it up, it's got a little
[01:40.540 --> 01:44.940]  tiny jar inside of it which contains the actual concentrates. It's a clear jar
[01:44.940 --> 01:48.300]  with a black lid. Once again we got the cool-ass Garden of Weden logo on the top.
[01:48.300 --> 01:51.820]  Shout out to my friends at the Garden of Weden for getting their products on
[01:51.820 --> 01:56.260]  store shelves. I'm proud of you guys. They've only been back in Colorado for a
[01:56.260 --> 01:59.900]  short time, so to see them getting their stuff available is impressive, and it
[01:59.900 --> 02:04.180]  makes me happy. Also, the hash is high quality. The Clementine gets me high as
[02:04.180 --> 02:08.940]  shit. It tastes super good. I really do like this concentrate. So shout out to my
[02:08.980 --> 02:11.660]  friends at the Garden of Weden. Shout out to my friends over at Dr's Order Stem
[02:11.660 --> 02:16.100]  Beach. What's up Maddie? What's up Bree? Hope everybody's doing well. Alright, let's
[02:16.100 --> 02:20.780]  move forward with this podcast here. I told you what I'm smoking on. What else
[02:20.780 --> 02:24.060]  do we want to talk about? I like to keep you guys updated on my breeding projects.
[02:24.060 --> 02:27.980]  Of course, I am breeding some new seeds. I've been talking about it. There is, of
[02:27.980 --> 02:31.780]  course, I used an Arise male, and I put the pollen on. There are several girls in
[02:31.780 --> 02:35.060]  there, but the ones I've been talking a lot about are the Stardog, and the Durban
[02:35.060 --> 02:40.380]  Poison, and the Platinum Tangy. They are loaded with seeds. They will be done in
[02:40.380 --> 02:44.500]  sometime around 10 to 15 days. I keep checking on them. They're close. They're
[02:44.500 --> 02:48.300]  close, you guys. I like to time seeds kind of perfectly. I know what I'm
[02:48.300 --> 02:51.140]  looking for, and they are almost there. They're not quite there yet, but they're
[02:51.140 --> 02:55.380]  very close. So that breeding project is almost done. I'll have Stardog to
[02:55.380 --> 02:59.820]  Arise. I will have Durban Poison to Arise, Platinum Tangy to Arise, and a couple
[02:59.820 --> 03:04.100]  other great things in there. I'm making more of old things that I sell out of at
[03:04.260 --> 03:08.220]  the Helladank Seed Bank. So there'll be some refreshers coming and some brand
[03:08.220 --> 03:12.900]  new shit. Another thing I want to talk about is, since I'm talking about
[03:12.900 --> 03:19.940]  breeding, this year in 2018, I am going to remake the Lemon Jeffrey Feminized
[03:19.940 --> 03:24.140]  Seeds, which means while I'm at it, I will remake the Golden Goat Feminized Seeds.
[03:24.140 --> 03:28.780]  Also, a lot of people think I created Golden Goat. I did not create Golden Goat.
[03:28.780 --> 03:32.940]  I got Golden Goat early on when it was really popular in the Colorado dispensary
[03:32.940 --> 03:37.100]  run. It went around like wildfire. Everybody had it. I grabbed myself a
[03:37.100 --> 03:40.780]  clone of it. I started growing it. I realized how much I loved it. I love the
[03:40.780 --> 03:44.500]  high. I love the flavor. I love the effects. I like growing it. It's a great
[03:44.500 --> 03:48.100]  plant to grow. It gives me big fat weight. I started growing it a lot. I took some
[03:48.100 --> 03:51.420]  great photos of it. The photos got passed around, and everybody saw them on social
[03:51.420 --> 03:55.700]  media. Then I started breeding to the Golden Goat, and then I made Golden Goat
[03:55.700 --> 04:00.060]  Feminized Seeds and put those out available through an old vendor.
[04:00.780 --> 04:05.340]  Everybody thought I made it. I did not make it. A guy by the name of Mr. Dank
[04:05.340 --> 04:08.940]  actually made the Golden Goat. I'm just known for growing the shit out of it, and
[04:08.940 --> 04:13.300]  I made Fem seeds of it and passed them around. I did not create it. Let me not
[04:13.300 --> 04:17.700]  take credit for that. I did make the Lemon Jeffrey. I used the Golden Goat
[04:17.700 --> 04:22.420]  reversed pollen and put that on the female Lemon Skunk, and that made Lemon
[04:22.420 --> 04:26.140]  Jeffrey Fem seeds. That is one I did make. I just want to clear that up, but I'm
[04:26.140 --> 04:29.820]  going to make more Golden Goat seeds, and I'm going to make more Lemon Jeffrey
[04:29.820 --> 04:35.580]  seeds. Probably there will be one run between the breeding project that's
[04:35.580 --> 04:39.260]  wrapping up, and then there'll be a run between that, and then that's when I
[04:39.260 --> 04:44.940]  plan on doing the Golden Goat Lemon Skunk cross again. It'll be this year,
[04:44.940 --> 04:47.780]  but it will be quite a while. There are other projects in line. I've got a
[04:47.780 --> 04:50.820]  schedule of things that I want to do, and I've got things lined up. The clones are
[04:50.820 --> 04:53.780]  already cut. The little baby plants are growing. Shit's in motion, so you just
[04:53.780 --> 04:56.860]  have to keep the wheels turning or things will fall apart. I can't rush
[04:57.020 --> 05:01.660]  things, but it will come. Everything will come in time. And Lemon Jeffrey, let me
[05:01.660 --> 05:04.580]  mention that. If you guys haven't heard about the Lemon Jeffrey, that's Lemon
[05:04.580 --> 05:09.300]  Skunk to Golden Goat, and it has made some pretty impressive tests. I've seen
[05:09.300 --> 05:15.380]  very high 20s and low 30s consistently from the Lemon Jeffrey, but my favorite
[05:15.380 --> 05:20.340]  part is the concentrates that it makes. It makes live resin that tastes like
[05:20.340 --> 05:25.180]  lemon candy, and it is so delicious. It's one of my favorite strains. It's
[05:25.180 --> 05:28.820]  certainly one of my top three most proud strains that I've made. Somebody
[05:28.820 --> 05:32.500]  asked me on Instagram live what my proudest strains are. In no particular
[05:32.500 --> 05:36.820]  order, Arise, Grateful Dog, and Lemon Jeffrey would be my three favorites. So
[05:36.820 --> 05:39.900]  the Lemon Jeff is up there, and it's currently unavailable in seed form
[05:39.900 --> 05:43.220]  anywhere, so we're gonna fix that. We're gonna get some over at the Hella Dank
[05:43.220 --> 05:47.060]  Seed Company. We'll get them laced up. Alright, podcast world, let's move
[05:47.060 --> 05:51.340]  forward. I have got an email from a listener. I really like reading emails
[05:51.500 --> 05:55.340]  and helping people out because then I know I'm hitting my target audience.
[05:55.340 --> 05:58.540]  There's somebody out there that's gonna get very useful information from this
[05:58.540 --> 06:03.100]  email, and I feel like if one person has this problem, a lot of people possibly
[06:03.100 --> 06:06.980]  have this problem, and they just have not emailed me to ask about it. So I'm gonna
[06:06.980 --> 06:11.260]  read this email. If you want to email me, I encourage you to do so. It's
[06:11.260 --> 06:15.740]  growfromyourheartathotmail.com. Go ahead and send me an email. I may read
[06:15.740 --> 06:18.940]  your email on a future episode. I'm trying to get through all of them. There
[06:18.940 --> 06:23.260]  are a lot of emails, you guys. If you want me to say your name on the show, let
[06:23.260 --> 06:26.980]  me know. If you don't want me to say your name, just say, hey, my name is this, but
[06:26.980 --> 06:29.860]  don't say it on the podcast, and then I'll do my best to be respectful with
[06:29.860 --> 06:33.820]  your name and not blast it on the show. Anyway, this email goes like this. Oh,
[06:33.820 --> 06:37.560]  first of all, I should preface this. This guy sent me an email asking if it was in
[06:37.560 --> 06:41.380]  fact the real Rasta Jeff. He wasn't sure if he had the correct email address, so I
[06:41.380 --> 06:44.340]  replied with, this is in fact the real Rasta Jeff, and I look forward to your
[06:44.340 --> 06:49.060]  questions. So he says, oh dude, I am so stoked you answered. I didn't think you
[06:49.060 --> 06:52.420]  would. I will answer your emails. It may take me a little while, but I will. There
[06:52.420 --> 06:57.220]  are a lot of them. He also said, I'm so sorry for the weird first email. I live
[06:57.220 --> 07:00.700]  in Prohibition Land, and I'm super paranoid about sending grow questions to
[07:00.700 --> 07:04.500]  an email address I've never messaged. Hey, good work being careful, man. I
[07:04.500 --> 07:08.060]  appreciate that. You're doing a good job there. He also says, I have a million
[07:08.060 --> 07:12.300]  questions, and literally no one around me to bounce ideas or thoughts off of, and
[07:12.300 --> 07:17.540]  that's exactly what caused me to come across your podcast. First off, thank you
[07:17.540 --> 07:21.180]  man so much for doing what you do. You're welcome, man. Thanks for noticing, and I'm
[07:21.180 --> 07:24.340]  glad that I'm able to help somebody who feels like they don't have anybody else
[07:24.340 --> 07:28.300]  to turn to. That's kind of part of what my mission was, so I'm glad to help you.
[07:28.300 --> 07:32.100]  You're very welcome. Thanks for noticing. The message goes on to say, I've been
[07:32.100 --> 07:36.660]  listening to you and the Dude Grows podcast for months. I listen in every day
[07:36.660 --> 07:41.940]  at work as well as when I'm in the grow room. Man, I love that the Dude Grows
[07:41.980 --> 07:45.860]  show and myself share such a cool audience. I really like the community
[07:45.860 --> 07:49.220]  that works around both of our shows. That's really cool, and I like going to
[07:49.220 --> 07:53.340]  the Dude Grows Cup, and I like those guys a lot. I'm actually working on learning
[07:53.340 --> 07:56.340]  how to run Skype through my audio system and get everything dialed in so that I
[07:56.340 --> 08:00.460]  can do a group chat and do a podcast with the Dude Grows guys. We keep talking
[08:00.460 --> 08:04.060]  about it. Everybody just gets overwhelmed and busy, and it doesn't happen. It's time
[08:04.060 --> 08:07.700]  to make it happen. He keeps on, and he says, because of your format, you can
[08:07.700 --> 08:11.900]  literally listen to the same podcast multiple times and still be entertaining
[08:11.940 --> 08:16.380]  and informative. Well, that's really cool, man. I can barely listen back to it the
[08:16.380 --> 08:18.860]  time that I have to edit it, and it drives me nuts. So I'm glad that you're
[08:18.860 --> 08:22.500]  able to listen multiple times. That's pretty cool, and it keeps you
[08:22.500 --> 08:26.780]  entertained more than once. Experienced growers are celebrities and superheroes
[08:26.780 --> 08:30.380]  to me, man. Anyway, wow, that's cool that you think we are celebrities and
[08:30.380 --> 08:34.540]  superheroes. Come to Colorado sometime. Well, Colorado kind of shut down all the
[08:34.540 --> 08:37.820]  cool-ass events. You got to go to California now, which California may fuck
[08:37.820 --> 08:40.660]  up all the cool events too now that they've changed all their rules. Go to
[08:40.660 --> 08:43.380]  one of the weed events. Just come to a cannabis event. You know what? Come to the
[08:43.380 --> 08:48.700]  Endo Expo. There's an expo here a couple... shit, it's next weekend in Denver. By the
[08:48.700 --> 08:53.620]  time this comes out, it will be Saturday. The Expo is the Saturday after this
[08:53.620 --> 08:56.340]  episode comes out. It's Sunday. You can only go Sunday if you're part of the
[08:56.340 --> 09:01.580]  public. Check out the Endo Expo. A lot of weed celebrities will be there. If you
[09:01.580 --> 09:05.140]  think experienced growers and breeders and folks like that are superheroes and
[09:05.140 --> 09:08.420]  celebrities, a lot of those folks will be there. Just go to one of those events, and
[09:08.460 --> 09:12.140]  you can meet so many of those people. Let me know if you're coming to an event in
[09:12.140 --> 09:15.940]  Denver, and I'll do my best to get up there, and we can hang out, and we'll get
[09:15.940 --> 09:18.380]  to meet some of your heroes and shit. I'll make sure you meet at least a couple
[09:18.380 --> 09:23.060]  other people. Maybe send you home with some iReed genetics. The email goes on
[09:23.060 --> 09:28.140]  like this. It says, anyway, my question. I am running either critical or landish
[09:28.140 --> 09:32.620]  strain. And then he says, funny story in parentheses, but he also says, full cocoa
[09:32.620 --> 09:38.620]  nutrient line, pH at 5.9 in cocoa, DNA with cork in seven gallon smart pots. The
[09:38.620 --> 09:45.700]  lights are two Mars Hydro lights, 140 watt lights, one Cree CXB 3590 at 58
[09:45.700 --> 09:51.980]  watts, and two no-name shit full spectrum 50 watt cobs with reflectors and lenses.
[09:52.140 --> 09:55.940]  The cobs are circuits on board is what I think that stands for. He also says, I'm
[09:55.940 --> 10:00.940]  running a little extra CO2 than ambient. So he just described his, he tells me as
[10:00.940 --> 10:04.180]  a question, then he describes his setup. He's running, he's not sure which strain
[10:04.180 --> 10:08.260]  he's got. It's either critical or landish. And he says, funny story there,
[10:08.420 --> 10:12.460]  which a really easy story to imagine being a very experienced grower who has
[10:12.460 --> 10:16.060]  worked in several grows and worked with dipshit helpers that have crossed labels
[10:16.260 --> 10:20.020]  and me being too high on cross labels and which seeds are these, which clones are
[10:20.020 --> 10:24.460]  these. That story is not even funny. I know how that shit goes, but he's got one
[10:24.460 --> 10:28.980]  or the other. He's running full cocoa. The pH is at 5.9. We're going to talk about
[10:28.980 --> 10:33.980]  that. He's doing DNA with cork, the cocoa DNA with cork and seven gallons, smart
[10:33.980 --> 10:37.620]  pots, all that makes sense so far. Then he describes the lights. There are a lot of
[10:37.620 --> 10:40.660]  lights. I don't know how far apart or how close they are, but so far it seems like
[10:40.660 --> 10:45.660]  it should be cool. Then also he's enriching a little extra CO2. So now we have a
[10:45.660 --> 10:49.180]  pretty good overview of what's going on in the room. We know what's in there and
[10:49.180 --> 10:53.020]  we know how much lights in there. So let's get to the question. He said, I noticed
[10:53.020 --> 10:56.500]  just a few days after switching to bloom, all of my fan leaves started turning
[10:56.500 --> 11:01.060]  yellow, all but the veins then would progressively turn more yellow. I'm
[11:01.060 --> 11:04.780]  thinking cow mag issue, but the growth store assured me there was a ton of it in
[11:04.780 --> 11:08.740]  the newts and I shouldn't need the supplement. They told me to up my pH to
[11:08.740 --> 11:13.500]  six, three to six, four, and it all should be well. Could it be something else? Any
[11:13.500 --> 11:18.060]  thoughts? And then he says again, man, thanks for responding. It means a lot.
[11:18.700 --> 11:21.860]  Hey man, you're very welcome for the response. Thanks for the great email. Uh,
[11:21.860 --> 11:25.740]  I need a drink and I need a dab. So I am going to press pause for a second and
[11:25.740 --> 11:28.980]  take a quick drink and moisten up my throat and also take a dab while I'm
[11:28.980 --> 11:34.020]  there. While I'm doing that, I encourage you guys to check out patreon.com slash
[11:34.060 --> 11:38.180]  grow from your heart. When you go to patreon.com slash grow from your heart,
[11:38.460 --> 11:42.300]  all the information you need will be right there. If you decide to contribute
[11:42.300 --> 11:46.700]  to Patreon, there is a button that says become a patron, click on there. It will
[11:46.700 --> 11:50.100]  give you all the information that you need and I will greatly appreciate it.
[11:50.340 --> 11:53.420]  All right, you guys, it is time for a drink and a dab and I'll be right back
[11:53.540 --> 11:54.540]  to answer this email.
[11:55.740 --> 12:14.930]  All right. Podcast world. I am back. I am well hydrated and heavily medicated.
[12:15.250 --> 12:19.890]  I've got some sour Joker high cannabinoid full spectrum extract. It's the diamonds.
[12:19.890 --> 12:23.290]  It looks like little, little crystals in the jar here. There's little chunks of,
[12:23.290 --> 12:29.130]  uh, just THC madness. It's a 97% THC. And then on the other hand, I have got some
[12:29.170 --> 12:32.690]  orange ghost batter. Let's see if I can find the label for the orange ghost
[12:32.690 --> 12:36.050]  batter. It should be right here. I did not set that one aside. Let's see. It
[12:36.050 --> 12:39.130]  does not have the lab test on that one. I need the other one with the lab test.
[12:39.530 --> 12:45.490]  Orange goes to batter, uh, 76% THC. So I take a little bit of the orange ghost
[12:45.490 --> 12:48.490]  batter. It's a little softer and easier to work with. I stick a little bit of
[12:48.490 --> 12:51.650]  that on the dabber and then I take some of those high cannabinoid full spectrum
[12:51.650 --> 12:55.730]  extract crystals and stick those right inside of the batter. And then I take a
[12:55.730 --> 12:59.570]  big old fat dab of that. Uh, it is, it's a cold night. It's frosty, cold in
[12:59.570 --> 13:03.810]  Colorado, but I am sweating here at the table. I am sweating. I am sweating. I
[13:03.810 --> 13:08.450]  am sweating here at the table. I am super medicated and super sweaty. So
[13:08.690 --> 13:12.450]  that was a highly effective dab. Shout out to the crew at apothecary for
[13:12.450 --> 13:16.370]  wrecking me right now. All right, now let's get back on track here. Our
[13:16.370 --> 13:20.010]  friend sent us an email asking why his leaves were turning yellow. He also sent
[13:20.010 --> 13:24.450]  me a picture and those leaves are very pale and yellow. They need some
[13:24.450 --> 13:31.010]  nutrients. Uh, let's talk a little bit about some, uh, things here. Um, I think
[13:31.010 --> 13:34.370]  it's a nitrogen deficiency. Uh, the people at the grocery store don't seem
[13:34.370 --> 13:37.570]  to think it's a cow mag problem. It could have something to do with the cow
[13:37.570 --> 13:41.210]  mag, but it's more of a nitrogen deficiency. I feel like those leaves
[13:41.530 --> 13:45.290]  don't have any green to them, which is probably a nitrogen problem from the
[13:45.290 --> 13:50.450]  picture you sent me. If you go to Google and you Google cannabis leaf problems,
[13:50.450 --> 13:53.890]  it'll bring up a chart. And if you look at that chart, there are a couple that
[13:53.890 --> 13:57.930]  will fool you. You'll want to think it's sulfur or a zinc deficiency, but the
[13:57.930 --> 14:02.210]  obvious one that it looks like is a nitrogen deficiency. And when you said
[14:02.210 --> 14:06.610]  that it started, as soon as you switched to flower, that gives me another hint at
[14:06.610 --> 14:11.410]  what could be going on here. Bloom nutrients are very low in nitrogen. Your
[14:11.410 --> 14:18.250]  plant takes up 85 to 90% of its nitrogen during its vegetative stage of its life.
[14:18.650 --> 14:21.410]  Now you've switched to flower, which tells me you've probably switched to
[14:21.410 --> 14:25.930]  your flower nutrients. And if you read the bottles, there is an NPK value
[14:25.930 --> 14:29.170]  printed on the front of those bottles. And the N stands for nitrogen. If you
[14:29.170 --> 14:33.610]  look at your, your base nutrient and you look at the nitrogen level of your veg
[14:33.610 --> 14:38.250]  nutrient, it will be a much higher nutrient, uh, nitrogen value than on the
[14:38.250 --> 14:42.650]  flowering nutrient. That first number, the N perhaps, and I'm just making up
[14:42.650 --> 14:47.290]  numbers here. It'll be seven on your veg nutrient and it'll be 0.5 on your
[14:47.290 --> 14:50.570]  flowering nutrient. So you're dropping out the nitrogen as soon as you switched
[14:50.570 --> 14:55.050]  to flower. Now that may be okay, but it looks like it's not for your plants. So
[14:55.050 --> 14:59.650]  I would mix in a little bit of the veg nutrients with your feed. Do 50% of the
[14:59.650 --> 15:02.930]  flowering nutrient and 50% of the veg nutrient. And maybe that'll help you.
[15:03.170 --> 15:06.250]  You're going to be chasing it. You're never going to catch up with that
[15:06.250 --> 15:09.490]  nitrogen. It's already so far ahead of you. I don't think you'll be able to
[15:09.490 --> 15:13.090]  catch up. It's far gone. It needs some help. It needs some love. I would
[15:13.090 --> 15:16.930]  consider foliar feeding it with some base nutrients as well. I think the main
[15:16.930 --> 15:21.370]  problem is a nitrogen deficiency. I would foliar feed it. I would pull off a
[15:21.370 --> 15:24.610]  lot of the bottom leaves and a lot of the lower shit, just so that the
[15:24.650 --> 15:28.650]  nutrients that it does get can be moved around more useful. If it doesn't have
[15:28.650 --> 15:33.730]  12 arms, it can make two arms stronger if that makes any sense. Also, I think
[15:33.730 --> 15:40.010]  part of the problem that may cause your yellowing may be low light conditions.
[15:40.010 --> 15:44.490]  I don't know enough about the LEDs that you listed to have any idea what you're
[15:44.490 --> 15:48.690]  talking about, but low light conditions could lead to what you're talking about.
[15:49.610 --> 15:52.850]  Low nutrients could lead to what you're talking about. You may need more
[15:52.850 --> 15:58.010]  nutrients overall. Also, you may be giving the plants too much water. They
[15:58.010 --> 16:02.930]  may be root bound. They may be drowning in there. The pH could be off. You said
[16:02.930 --> 16:08.250]  the pH is at 5.9. The guys at the grocery store are completely correct. You should
[16:08.250 --> 16:15.930]  go to 6.3 to 6.4. 6.3 to 6.5, somewhere in that range, would be better. I would
[16:15.930 --> 16:19.930]  assume that if you put the pH around 6.3 and started feeding with a
[16:19.930 --> 16:23.210]  little more nitrogen, you'll start seeing more productivity from the plants.
[16:23.210 --> 16:27.410]  They may start greening up on you, but you're going to be chasing it. It's going
[16:27.410 --> 16:32.410]  to be a battle the entire grow. Another thing I want to mention, you said
[16:32.410 --> 16:38.050]  you are running a little extra CO2 than ambient. You're giving the plants
[16:38.050 --> 16:42.370]  more CO2, which means they're growing more rapidly, which means they are going
[16:42.370 --> 16:47.290]  to want to eat more rapidly. If you're going to run CO2, you're going to have to
[16:47.290 --> 16:51.090]  use more nutrients. You're going to have to dial in the pH. If you're growing in
[16:51.090 --> 16:56.770]  cocoa, as described, I would recommend every time you water that plant that it
[16:56.770 --> 17:01.530]  gets nutrients. In cocoa, I never give the plants plain water. They always get
[17:01.530 --> 17:05.810]  nutrients. I always pH. I run a large commercial grow. In
[17:05.810 --> 17:12.290]  one room in the bedroom, we can have 700 plants in veg at one time. I water
[17:12.410 --> 17:19.850]  them every day. I pH that water to 6.3 and I put nutrients in the water every
[17:19.850 --> 17:24.890]  single day. We are in three gallon pots of cocoa with perlite in it. That's
[17:24.890 --> 17:30.730]  what I'm doing in a large-scale facility. 6.3 and I feed nutrients every time.
[17:30.730 --> 17:33.490]  I'm in cocoa. That's what I would recommend for you and it may help you
[17:33.490 --> 17:36.970]  out. If you're growing in cocoa and you're not feeding it nutrients almost
[17:36.970 --> 17:40.810]  every watering, you're going to start to see deficiencies because cocoa doesn't
[17:40.810 --> 17:43.810]  hang on to anything. It all just runs right out of the bottom of the plant
[17:43.810 --> 17:46.930]  with the water. What the plant doesn't absorb, it doesn't hang out for too long.
[17:46.930 --> 17:52.210]  My official diagnosis is that's a nitrogen deficiency. You could
[17:52.210 --> 17:55.970]  adjust the pH. That may help it. I would add nutrients. I would water with
[17:55.970 --> 17:59.530]  nutrients every time you water that plant until you start flushing it. I
[17:59.530 --> 18:02.490]  would pull off the leaves on the bottom and the shit leaves that don't look good.
[18:02.490 --> 18:06.410]  Any lower branches you don't need, take those off. If there are branches that
[18:06.410 --> 18:10.130]  have little tiny sucker branches coming off, clean that bullshit off there also.
[18:10.130 --> 18:14.930]  If you take off all the weak branches, all the strong branches will be stronger.
[18:14.930 --> 18:19.050]  They'll get more use of the nutrients. I would kind of clean up the bottom
[18:19.050 --> 18:23.170]  lollipop a little extra. Take off the bottom of the crap, just the
[18:23.170 --> 18:27.010]  fluffy shit and just kind of focus more on just a few tops. Pick a few winning
[18:27.010 --> 18:30.290]  branches. Hopefully you can get six or eight winning branches out of the tops
[18:30.290 --> 18:34.170]  and use those as your main winners and take all that bottom crap off. So that
[18:34.170 --> 18:37.370]  way you still have that big strong root ball and it's able to cycle that much
[18:37.370 --> 18:40.330]  nutrients but it's only got to feed like six tops instead of a bunch of
[18:40.330 --> 18:43.090]  bullshit on the bottom. That may help you out get the nutrients where you need
[18:43.090 --> 18:46.930]  them. A foliar feed could help you out. You may be watering too much. Is that
[18:46.930 --> 18:50.650]  plant sitting on a cold floor? That's something I just thought of. Is it on the
[18:50.650 --> 18:55.170]  floor? Is that floor getting cold? That may be pissing your root ball off. That
[18:55.170 --> 18:58.970]  that may be a huge thing. Is that plant sitting on the cold floor and then you
[18:58.970 --> 19:03.050]  water it and it's sitting in a saucer and then all of that water sits in that
[19:03.050 --> 19:08.210]  saucer for however long and those roots are just sitting there in cold shitty
[19:08.210 --> 19:12.450]  water. Put your hand in cold shitty water overnight. Put your toes in cold
[19:12.450 --> 19:15.450]  shitty water overnight and see how much you like that. Your leaves will turn
[19:15.450 --> 19:20.090]  yellow also. So those are all things that I think may help you out. Those are oh
[19:20.090 --> 19:23.570]  and also if you're running co2 you guys if you are enriching co2 you are
[19:23.570 --> 19:28.210]  encouraging that plant to grow faster. You are turning that plant from a normal
[19:28.210 --> 19:31.770]  performer from a normal athlete into an MMA fighter. You are now giving it
[19:31.770 --> 19:35.090]  steroids. You have to feed it like it's on steroids. You can't just give it a
[19:35.090 --> 19:39.170]  normal diet. Imagine right now if I didn't give you any extra vitamins or
[19:39.170 --> 19:42.890]  nutrients and I told you just go run up hills until you pass out. It's not gonna
[19:42.890 --> 19:46.930]  take a long time. If I give you more nutrients and I give you a better meal
[19:46.930 --> 19:49.970]  plan and I say now go run until you pass out. You're gonna be able to run a
[19:49.970 --> 19:52.810]  little faster because you got the proper nutrition. The plants need the proper
[19:52.810 --> 19:56.530]  nutrition when you give them that co2 steroids. So if you're gonna enrich co2
[19:56.530 --> 20:01.690]  and make them stronger you have to make them stronger all the way around. Also I
[20:01.690 --> 20:04.890]  should mention here if you're gonna feed co2 at the start of flower you
[20:04.890 --> 20:08.930]  cannot stop feeding it co2 because they're gonna start eating like they're
[20:08.930 --> 20:11.970]  getting fed co2. They're gonna start growing like they're getting fed co2 and
[20:11.970 --> 20:15.050]  when you cut that out it's really gonna confuse them and they're gonna start
[20:15.050 --> 20:18.570]  having problems. They're gonna start growing odd. Instead of growing a big
[20:18.570 --> 20:22.410]  long cola they'll start doing these little like a bud here a bud here a bud
[20:22.410 --> 20:25.170]  here and it'll never fit all the way together like a cola. It'll just be a
[20:25.170 --> 20:28.850]  bunch of little popcorn balls. It'll really fuck up your harvest weight and
[20:28.850 --> 20:33.010]  it's kind of a waste of co2 if you start using it and then you stop. So if
[20:33.010 --> 20:36.490]  you can't afford to run co2 through the whole flowering cycle I would recommend
[20:36.490 --> 20:42.090]  don't start until week 3 or maybe week 4 or maybe even not at all. If you're
[20:42.090 --> 20:45.530]  just running a home grow you can pull pretty good harvest without co2 but if
[20:45.530 --> 20:48.770]  you're gonna run it run it all the way through. That's my recommendation and
[20:48.770 --> 20:54.130]  don't overdo it because you can overdo the co2. Alright I feel like I ranted and
[20:54.130 --> 20:58.770]  rambled for a really long time for one email. This guy did not say if he wants
[20:58.770 --> 21:02.930]  me to use his name or not and he's in prohibition land so I'm just gonna be
[21:02.930 --> 21:07.110]  respectful and not even say his name but dude you know who you are. You've got my
[21:07.110 --> 21:11.210]  respect. Thanks for the great email. Try some of the corrections I recommended if
[21:11.210 --> 21:14.810]  you'd like to or don't but if you do some of them send me a message and let
[21:14.810 --> 21:17.490]  me know what works for you and let me know if you agree with I with what I
[21:17.490 --> 21:21.450]  said. Just interact with me on this and we'll keep the conversation going.
[21:21.450 --> 21:25.170]  Alright if you guys want to email me if you've got cannabis growing questions if
[21:25.170 --> 21:28.530]  you've got something to say if you want to ask me something send me an email
[21:28.530 --> 21:33.330]  it's growfromyourheart at hotmail.com I would love to hear from you. Alright you
[21:33.330 --> 21:37.130]  guys I've got it something else I wanted to talk about. Have you ever grown some
[21:37.130 --> 21:41.650]  really good herb and then you dried and cured it and then Mike fucked up and
[21:41.650 --> 21:45.230]  left it open for too long and it got all dry and crispy and you did not know what
[21:45.230 --> 21:49.730]  you were gonna do with this dry and crispy weed? Well you guys don't panic if
[21:49.730 --> 21:53.610]  Mike leaves your giant Tupperware dish with like four to six pounds worth of
[21:53.610 --> 21:58.610]  really top-shelf buds open for way too long because I've learned a pretty good
[21:58.610 --> 22:04.250]  trick that I feel works to re-moisten these buds. I've seen people do a whole
[22:04.250 --> 22:07.490]  bunch of dumb shit over the years and when you think about re-moistening buds
[22:07.490 --> 22:11.530]  a lot of you experienced growers you probably cringe a little bit but it's
[22:11.530 --> 22:15.010]  Colorado and I'm just picking on Mike he didn't leave things open for too long he
[22:15.010 --> 22:18.170]  opened the container and in Colorado you can have buds that are nice and moist
[22:18.170 --> 22:21.450]  and you can open the container and by the time you close it those buds are too
[22:21.450 --> 22:25.810]  fucking dry. It's Colorado it's dry here. We've got a humidifier we've got a
[22:25.810 --> 22:29.450]  dehumidifier they try to keep things in with within a certain range but
[22:29.450 --> 22:34.450]  sometimes shit gets out of hand and some buds dry up. Now we have learned a good
[22:34.450 --> 22:39.330]  way to re-moisten these buds I've seen people use the classic is to use some
[22:39.330 --> 22:43.690]  fruit or something which that's that's not a bad idea but then you put that
[22:43.690 --> 22:47.650]  fruit flavor into the cannabis and who wants to grow good cannabis and then
[22:47.650 --> 22:50.570]  throw some fruit in there and make it taste like that? There are also other
[22:50.690 --> 22:53.970]  things you're introducing to the cannabis as you do that that may make it
[22:53.970 --> 22:58.530]  a little funky. I've seen people use bovita packs or bovita packs or
[22:58.530 --> 23:01.690]  humidipacks however you want to say it the little packets that you can order
[23:01.690 --> 23:06.210]  that add moisture and add humidity to a container I've seen people use those
[23:06.210 --> 23:10.210]  what I do not like about those is they leave a funky flavor they make your weed
[23:10.210 --> 23:14.330]  taste like water they make your weed taste like the way a bovita pack smells
[23:14.330 --> 23:19.670]  I don't like those. I guess sometimes it would be better to smoke some moist weed
[23:19.670 --> 23:23.310]  that kind of tasted like a bovita pack than to smoke some dusty ass weed that
[23:23.310 --> 23:27.230]  you rolled into a joint it all just falls apart but either way you fucked up
[23:27.230 --> 23:32.190]  and I found a better way to fix it. What Mike and I did we use a Tupperware dish
[23:32.190 --> 23:35.690]  it's a Rubbermaid bin it's the Rubbermaid bin that's probably about the
[23:35.690 --> 23:39.590]  size of a laundry bin like if you're gonna put your dirty laundry in a thing
[23:39.590 --> 23:42.610]  and take it to the laundry mat or down to the laundry room it's like the size
[23:42.610 --> 23:45.150]  of that laundry basket it's maybe a little bit bigger than that but you can
[23:45.150 --> 23:48.610]  fit a bunch of clothes in it that's the one we use at the commercial grow we cut
[23:48.610 --> 23:52.730]  down we take all the leaves off of a plant we cut down the whole plant we cut
[23:52.730 --> 23:56.290]  it into small pieces it hangs sorry we skipped a step here we cut down the
[23:56.290 --> 24:00.570]  plant it hangs it dries we cut it into smaller pieces and then we put it into
[24:00.570 --> 24:04.970]  these Rubbermaid bins now that's when the problems start happening sometimes
[24:04.970 --> 24:09.550]  those Rubbermaid bins aren't completely sealed and they get too dry I have
[24:09.550 --> 24:14.490]  learned that I can take not even a handful just a few leaves from a fresh
[24:14.490 --> 24:18.210]  plant I go to a flowering room and just pull a few leaves off of a fresh plant
[24:18.210 --> 24:22.290]  and throw those leaves into that Rubbermaid bin and close it up for four
[24:22.290 --> 24:27.930]  six maybe eight hours and those fresh leaves contain so much moisture that
[24:27.930 --> 24:31.810]  they remoisten your cannabis buds and the best part is it still tastes like
[24:31.810 --> 24:34.970]  cannabis because you're putting a cannabis leaf in there the bricks level
[24:34.970 --> 24:39.170]  is the same the aroma is the same it's the same plant you're just spreading the
[24:39.170 --> 24:44.210]  same moisture around and I approve it works very well I thought it would be
[24:44.210 --> 24:49.370]  cute and put like a handful of leaves in there way too much in a those laundry
[24:49.370 --> 24:55.530]  basket sized Rubbermaid bins I think four to five maybe six or eight leaves
[24:55.530 --> 25:00.570]  is plenty to put in there to remoisten some pretty dry buds so if you've got a
[25:00.570 --> 25:04.890]  jar of weed that went too dry maybe a couple of little leaves maybe one decent
[25:04.890 --> 25:09.810]  size leave in your jar would be enough to remoisten your dried buds so that's a
[25:09.810 --> 25:13.690]  trick quit using wet paper quit using a q-tip with water in it quit using a
[25:13.690 --> 25:18.970]  cotton ball if you're gonna do something if you can use a fresh leaf
[25:18.970 --> 25:23.290]  cut a leaf off put it right into the jar seal the jar up pay attention to it
[25:23.290 --> 25:26.730]  don't let it get too wet in there but it starts getting moist take that leaf out
[25:26.730 --> 25:29.850]  leave it open long enough for it to get right to the perfect dryness and seal

[25:33.290 --> 25:37.130]  because the moisture is inside also the moisture is gonna work its way out so if
