[00:01.150 --> 00:06.270]  Welcome back podcast world. I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is
[00:06.270 --> 00:11.830]  episode 600 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast. In this episode, I'm going to talk about properly
[00:11.830 --> 00:16.070]  selecting a phenotype for your garden. Before we get there, let's do a few shout outs to
[00:16.070 --> 00:20.370]  a few members of the 710 club. Of course, the 710 club are the folks who support us
[00:20.370 --> 00:25.730]  on Patreon at the $7 and 10 cent a month level or higher. So with no further ado, let's give
[00:25.730 --> 00:29.530]  a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to the painted lady. Let's follow
[00:29.630 --> 00:33.430]  that up with the big thank you shout out to tur burglar. I want to send a thank you shout
[00:33.430 --> 00:37.030]  out to grant m. I've always got a big thank you shout out for day run T. Let's send a

[01:26.830 --> 01:28.830]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, welcome
[01:29.070 --> 01:35.710]  600 episodes I can't believe I have made it to episode 600 not a big celebration in this show, but holy shit
[01:35.710 --> 01:36.990]  We did it big
[01:36.990 --> 01:40.350]  Thanks to everybody who has supported me if this is your first episode
[01:40.470 --> 01:44.570]  Jumping in or if you've been here since the beginning or if you jumped in somewhere in the middle. Thank you
[01:44.570 --> 01:49.630]  I do appreciate all of the interaction all of the support all of the words of encouragement all of the emails
[01:49.630 --> 01:53.870]  I even appreciate all the hate mail. All that does is motivate me a little bit more
[01:53.870 --> 01:58.950]  So, thank you. Also a big thank you to everybody who supports the show on patreon
[01:58.950 --> 02:02.870]  I want to send you a special. Thank you. Shout out right now. It does not go unnoticed
[02:02.870 --> 02:07.710]  You did improve the show drastically. So thank you to everybody and to all of the patreon
[02:08.230 --> 02:14.670]  Contributors 600 episodes you guys I never imagined it would get this far and honestly, I see no end in sight
[02:14.670 --> 02:20.870]  You guys are only sending me better content better questions. The interactions are much better. You guys are becoming better growers
[02:20.870 --> 02:25.670]  I've got to see people evolve as growers from the knowledge. They've learned from this show. So, thank you
[02:25.670 --> 02:29.230]  This does mean a lot to me and I do not plan on stopping
[02:29.470 --> 02:34.590]  I'm glad that all of the holiday bullshit is over. We are back to normal here. Things are calming down
[02:34.710 --> 02:38.730]  The podcast will kind of settle down. We'll get back to the normal podcasting schedule
[02:38.730 --> 02:42.550]  I didn't miss an episode, but I know that some of the episodes were short. Some of them were brief
[02:42.550 --> 02:48.950]  I have been skipping the patreon questions. There is a reason for that. I feel like everybody was on vacation
[02:48.950 --> 02:52.710]  They were on a Christmas holiday and a lot of people weren't able to listen to the podcast
[02:53.350 --> 02:59.710]  However, the regularly scheduled podcasting listening was happening. They may have had a lot of family around they may not have been at work
[02:59.710 --> 03:01.710]  They may have been off schedule just like I was
[03:01.750 --> 03:07.690]  So I didn't put your patreon questions in the past few episodes because I didn't want to waste those questions and people miss them
[03:07.790 --> 03:11.110]  So that is why the patreon stuff has been getting skipped in the next few episodes
[03:11.470 --> 03:17.870]  We will focus heavily on patreon content that way the people that did pay for those questions. They won't miss it
[03:17.870 --> 03:21.710]  They'll get their answers and they also got their time with their family during the holidays
[03:21.710 --> 03:23.150]  I hope I made that nice and clear
[03:23.150 --> 03:24.550]  I think I said that in another show
[03:24.550 --> 03:29.270]  Wanted to make sure you understand why the patreon questions have been getting overlooked for a couple of shows
[03:29.430 --> 03:32.270]  Now let's jump into the main topic of today's podcast
[03:32.270 --> 03:33.630]  This may be a quick show
[03:33.630 --> 03:38.150]  But in the last episode I did talk about running our plants on an 18-6
[03:38.230 --> 03:41.310]  Light schedule at the end of flower if you didn't listen to the last episode
[03:41.310 --> 03:45.990]  I'll recap that and tell you why I recommend that most of us put our plants on a 12-12
[03:46.310 --> 03:50.030]  Flowering light cycle that means the plants are the lights are on for 12 hours a day
[03:50.110 --> 03:53.570]  They're off for 12 hours a day. This triggers our plants to go into flower
[03:54.030 --> 03:55.670]  That is basic grow knowledge
[03:55.670 --> 04:03.670]  A lot of people will do an 1113 cycle that came from DJ short that 1113 cycle in my opinion in DJ shorts opinion
[04:03.670 --> 04:05.670]  As well will give us better
[04:05.670 --> 04:09.630]  Phenotypical expression if we're looking for different phenotypes from a package of seeds
[04:09.630 --> 04:12.990]  We want to see the variations from this seed and this seed a little more
[04:13.390 --> 04:20.170]  Defined that 1113 cycle in my opinion in DJ's experience will show us more variation
[04:20.470 --> 04:24.590]  More potential from each plant. So if you're running a population of plants
[04:24.590 --> 04:27.710]  You may not want the one that grows real tall and skinny
[04:27.710 --> 04:29.510]  You may not want the one that's real short and stout
[04:29.510 --> 04:30.870]  You may want the one that's right in the middle
[04:30.870 --> 04:35.950]  We run a pheno hunt to find the one that is perfect for us in that 1113 schedule
[04:35.950 --> 04:39.770]  You may see more expression from your plants now
[04:39.770 --> 04:41.450]  Let's jump to the 18 six part
[04:41.450 --> 04:47.250]  The reason I recommend to turn our timer back to 18 six for the last seven to ten days of flower
[04:47.250 --> 04:52.010]  Is because light is the number one source of energy for our plants light contributes
[04:52.530 --> 04:58.570]  Encourages growth contributes to all of the photosynthesis of our plants when the plants are awake. They're photosynthesizing
[04:58.570 --> 05:02.410]  They're getting beefier and fatter and they are growing with that more light energy
[05:02.410 --> 05:08.450]  If you go from 12 12 to 18 6, you're getting six more hours of light every day. That's that much more light energy
[05:08.450 --> 05:09.810]  They'll get bigger. They'll get beefier
[05:09.810 --> 05:15.210]  They'll get fatter and also they may ripen up a little bit earlier because of that extra light
[05:15.570 --> 05:20.970]  Now a lot of people are gonna say won't that fuck my plants up if I run them on 18 6 at the end
[05:21.530 --> 05:28.210]  Your plants eventually will start to revege, but we're flushing and preparing for harvest already
[05:28.210 --> 05:30.890]  So if we see any sign of that revege happening
[05:30.890 --> 05:35.890]  We chop down right then usually that revege is going to take 14 to 20 days to begin the process
[05:35.890 --> 05:42.290]  We're going to cut down 10 to 14 days in this process. We should never get to the point of revege now
[05:42.410 --> 05:45.810]  Here's something that I should mention if you're doing a phenol hunt
[05:46.010 --> 05:52.050]  Don't do this 18 6 stuff a phenol hunt should be ran as a phenol hunt. We want that to be done
[05:52.610 --> 05:57.330]  Scientifically if this is your first time with a strain if you're doing a phenol hunt if you've never run this clone before
[05:57.850 --> 06:02.610]  Don't do the 18 6 we need to learn our plants the first time we run them
[06:02.650 --> 06:07.890]  We're just getting introduced to these plants we just met this plant we need to learn it see what it likes
[06:08.130 --> 06:12.770]  Don't do that 18 6 at the end because you don't even know how long the plant should take to flower
[06:12.990 --> 06:15.370]  How do you know when to initiate 18 6?
[06:15.370 --> 06:20.650]  How do you know when to initiate flush if you don't even know how long these plants take to flower?
[06:20.650 --> 06:26.570]  So when you have a new plant if it's a seedling if it's a clone don't do a bunch of random
[06:26.770 --> 06:29.730]  experiments to it run your first plant under scientific
[06:30.370 --> 06:36.530]  Expectations scientific conditions do everything the same to your new plants you may be growing a plant that could be
[06:37.050 --> 06:43.010]  Absolutely the best plant ever but you did some experiment to it that thwarted its growth that slowed down its potential
[06:43.010 --> 06:48.090]  And it was your fault that that plant didn't get to the best it could be and now you're gonna call it because you think
[06:48.090 --> 06:50.010]  It's a run or you think it's shitty
[06:50.010 --> 06:53.130]  You're the one that did some weird shit to it and caused that problem
[06:53.170 --> 06:57.110]  So let's give these plants the opportunity set the plants up for success
[06:57.110 --> 07:02.130]  Just like we do ourselves give the plants the opportunity to shine treat your new plants
[07:02.670 --> 07:07.590]  Scientifically have a regimen for new plants. Don't try new experiments. Don't think I got these new seeds
[07:07.590 --> 07:12.630]  I'm gonna switch to a different soil this time. What how do you know what to expect from that soil?
[07:12.630 --> 07:17.230]  How do you know what to expect from those plants? What if those seeds grow like shit? Maybe it's that new soil
[07:17.230 --> 07:23.270]  What if they grow amazingly maybe it's that new soil. Let's not have too many variables for new plants and also
[07:23.870 --> 07:27.950]  Don't expect too much from that first run this first run is not going to be gold
[07:27.950 --> 07:31.350]  We are learning the plants you should have quality plants a quality harvest
[07:31.350 --> 07:39.350]  But that second and third run is when you're really looking to reach goals and break limits and have impressive cannabis that first run
[07:39.350 --> 07:45.350]  It's the first date don't expect to everybody doesn't put out on the first date. The first date is not always successful
[07:45.350 --> 07:50.870]  We need a couple of dates a couple of experiences to get to know this lady and make sure we satisfy this lady so that
[07:50.870 --> 07:54.430]  It can satisfy us get to learn your plants
[07:55.550 --> 07:59.230]  When we're finding we're looking for phenotypes here. We're looking for the males
[07:59.230 --> 08:02.390]  We're looking for the females if you're running from seed you could have a male seed
[08:02.510 --> 08:07.510]  Let's not do a bunch of experiments and a bunch of training and lollipopping to a male plant
[08:07.510 --> 08:12.390]  You could have a boy in there. Let's focus on females. We're learning the harvest times of these plants
[08:12.390 --> 08:15.030]  We're learning nutrient preferences. Do they need a lot of CalMag?
[08:15.030 --> 08:16.190]  Do they need a lot of nitrogen?
[08:16.190 --> 08:20.790]  Do they get mad if you get them too much CalMag some plants don't want a lot of CalMag later in flower
[08:20.950 --> 08:28.310]  We've got to learn these plants the first time we're running them. We've got to learn temperature and humidity and VPD preferences
[08:28.310 --> 08:33.750]  I've got some plants that want it really really dry. I've got some plants that would prefer a really moist climate
[08:33.750 --> 08:40.030]  I've got some plants that I only water every other time when I water the rest of my garden because they prefer a really really
[08:40.030 --> 08:45.630]  Dry soil base. So it's all about learning that plant if you're running a bunch of plants all at once
[08:45.630 --> 08:50.950]  Can you learn each plant individually? I don't know if you really can so the first time you're running a plant
[08:50.950 --> 08:54.430]  Let's focus if it's a seedling if it's a batch of seeds if it's a clone
[08:54.550 --> 08:59.030]  Let's focus on learning that plant before we do a bunch of crazy tricks and shit to it
[08:59.030 --> 09:03.990]  Let's not get too scientific too experimental. You need to learn when to harvest that plant
[09:03.990 --> 09:08.310]  How do you know when to start flushing that plant? How do you know if you're gonna do 18-6?
[09:08.310 --> 09:12.670]  How do you know when to start that? We don't know any of that stuff the first time we're running plants
[09:12.790 --> 09:17.070]  My advice to you is the first time you're running it build a relationship with that plant
[09:17.070 --> 09:21.670]  Let that plant show you what it wants to do before you force things upon that plant
[09:22.390 --> 09:28.550]  Also a lot of times when it's the first time I run a plant if the breeder said it'll be done in 60 days
[09:28.550 --> 09:30.230]  I'm going to go 70
[09:30.230 --> 09:35.110]  I want to see what happens at the end of flower a lot of plants will beef up at the end of flower
[09:35.110 --> 09:37.110]  They'll put on that extra bit of weight
[09:37.230 --> 09:42.030]  Then we add that 18-6 once we know the plant and we can get that extra extra bit of weight
[09:42.030 --> 09:45.190]  But how do you know what the plant does naturally if we don't run it once?
[09:45.350 --> 09:50.310]  Without doing a bunch of tricks and crazy weird shit to it. Let that plant be itself
[09:50.310 --> 09:55.150]  Let it grow for the pheno hunt once you've selected a keeper then you can manipulate it
[09:55.150 --> 09:58.330]  You can fuck with it. You can do all of your weird magic that you want to do to it
[09:58.330 --> 10:02.570]  You can impose your will on it. But the first time let that plant show you what it does
[10:03.510 --> 10:09.390]  Some plants frost up at the end if we cut it down too early if we don't let that plant go that extra 10 days
[10:09.670 --> 10:14.510]  We may not even know that it gets super frosty at the end some plants put on
[10:14.990 --> 10:20.770]  Beautiful colors toward the end of flower and if you cut it down at day 63 and that color happens at day 70
[10:20.770 --> 10:23.630]  You may never know it. So the first time you're running a plant
[10:23.630 --> 10:28.630]  I would recommend going a little bit longer and not messing with it. Let it go 5 10
[10:28.630 --> 10:32.710]  Maybe 12 extra days based on what the breeder says. I know you're in a hurry
[10:32.710 --> 10:37.670]  I know you want to get this crop down, but this is not the last crop you're going to grow
[10:37.670 --> 10:41.470]  Hopefully, hopefully this is the first crop and hopefully it's at the first date
[10:41.470 --> 10:45.530]  And if that first date goes well, you get a second date by the third and fourth date
[10:45.530 --> 10:50.190]  You've got some sort of rapport some sort of relationship. You've learned each other do that with your plants
[10:50.190 --> 10:52.690]  Let's not expect the plants to put out on the first date
[10:52.830 --> 10:57.130]  Let's learn them develop a relationship learn what that plant wants
[10:57.130 --> 11:01.110]  So we can satisfy that plant before we expect it to satisfy us
[11:01.790 --> 11:06.470]  That being said the first time we're running seeds. Let's not veg them forever
[11:06.470 --> 11:10.750]  I see people running brand new seeds in 7-gallon pots and they flip it into flour
[11:10.910 --> 11:14.190]  After like 60 days of vegging and they're pissed off that they've got a male
[11:14.670 --> 11:19.030]  Bro, we should have found out way before then if we had males or females
[11:19.030 --> 11:21.870]  Don't waste time and space and energy on big-ass plants
[11:21.870 --> 11:28.350]  If you don't even know if you've got a male or a female that first run should be a small test pheno hunt run
[11:28.350 --> 11:29.670]  This is an audition
[11:29.670 --> 11:34.490]  Don't spend all your money all your time all your energy all your space on the very first run
[11:34.490 --> 11:39.170]  That is not a successful way to do it. You're going to disappoint yourself if you've got ten seeds
[11:40.130 --> 11:41.610]  Probably five of them are males
[11:41.610 --> 11:48.010]  So if you don't put them in small pots and identify the males early you're already wasting space five of them are gonna get eliminated
[11:48.010 --> 11:53.310]  Maybe six of them. I've seen people come up with three females from a pack of ten before it's all about the numbers game
[11:53.570 --> 11:55.610]  Most likely you're gonna get 50-50
[11:55.610 --> 12:00.330]  So expect 50% of your plants to be cold before we even get into the flowering phase
[12:00.810 --> 12:07.690]  Then what if you got a bunch of junk what so you're gonna get five males then maybe you get five females
[12:07.690 --> 12:13.050]  Hopefully then you've got two phenotypes that are gonna be like, oh man. Those are the ones there's always one
[12:13.050 --> 12:15.230]  That's real tall one. That's real short one
[12:15.230 --> 12:19.770]  That smells real good one that's super frosty and then one that's kind of got all the traits
[12:19.770 --> 12:21.850]  But you wish it had one trade a little bit more
[12:22.090 --> 12:24.730]  So there's always that gamble when it comes to pheno hunt
[12:24.730 --> 12:29.050]  You've got to find the one that you want is what I'm getting at find the plant that you want
[12:29.050 --> 12:33.850]  Don't waste a bunch of time growing males. Don't waste a bunch of time doing experiments and shit
[12:33.850 --> 12:38.570]  Get them growing flower them find the keeper have a clone of that then the next time you run
[12:38.570 --> 12:43.050]  That's when we're going to start doing tricks. That's where we start manipulating. We've got the plant we want
[12:43.050 --> 12:45.490]  We've got the keeper for our grow now
[12:45.490 --> 12:51.930]  We can do tricks to it, but let the plants show you who they are before you start manipulating them in that first run now
[12:52.410 --> 12:58.050]  Here's something that a lot of people have been asking me a lot of questions about and I've kind of changed the direction
[12:58.050 --> 13:01.770]  I go when I give advice on this a lot of people say hey
[13:01.770 --> 13:08.050]  I bought a pack of this strain and they've got my seeds and they want to say which phenotype am I looking for? I
[13:09.010 --> 13:14.290]  Don't know. I don't know which phenotype you're looking for because I don't know what kind of grow you've got
[13:14.290 --> 13:19.210]  I don't know what kind of smoke you're expecting. I don't know. I don't know what you want
[13:19.210 --> 13:21.530]  I know that you may have a pack of lemon Jeffrey
[13:21.530 --> 13:23.910]  There are a couple of desirable phenotypes in there
[13:23.910 --> 13:28.310]  But if I say you want the one that grows in 70 days that smells like lemon candy
[13:28.310 --> 13:30.470]  That takes a lot of nutrients and gets real tall
[13:30.470 --> 13:37.030]  I may be setting you up for failure because maybe your grow has a short ceiling height and now the phenotype that I want is
[13:37.030 --> 13:38.710]  Not going to work in your grow
[13:38.710 --> 13:44.830]  So the whole idea of buying a pack of seeds and doing that phenol hunt is finding the phenotype that works best for you
[13:45.310 --> 13:47.550]  You don't want to go to dinner with me. I'm a vegetarian
[13:47.670 --> 13:52.830]  I like spicy food and I drink a lot of kombucha unless you're into spicy food and kombucha
[13:52.830 --> 13:58.310]  You don't want me ordering your meal when we go to the restaurant. We want that. We both wanted Italian food
[13:58.310 --> 14:03.150]  That's why we went to the Italian restaurant. We've got a guideline here. We know that there's Italian food in there now
[14:03.150 --> 14:07.470]  We've got to narrow it down off the menu and get the Italian food for me and the Italian food for you
[14:07.630 --> 14:09.990]  Don't make me pick your Italian food
[14:09.990 --> 14:11.110]  like I may pick
[14:11.110 --> 14:16.110]  white sauce and real garlicky pasta and you may have just been right in the mood for a red sauce and
[14:16.190 --> 14:18.790]  Something a little more not garlicky. What's the word for it?
[14:18.790 --> 14:21.630]  Anyway more acidic with that red sauce is what you were in the mood for
[14:21.790 --> 14:26.510]  We may want completely different things and they both fall under the umbrella of lemon Jeffrey
[14:26.510 --> 14:32.950]  They both fall under the umbrella of Italian food. So you make your selection. Don't let me choose for you. I'll give you
[14:33.790 --> 14:39.230]  Recommendations and ideas of what to look for but that phenotype is not up to me. That is up to you
[14:39.230 --> 14:40.390]  That is up to your garden
[14:40.390 --> 14:44.610]  Do you want the one that takes 70 days to grow because I like those longer finishing plants
[14:44.610 --> 14:47.030]  I think they get a little more potency. I think they put on more weight
[14:47.030 --> 14:51.830]  I appreciate a long flowering plant. Maybe you're too impatient. Maybe you need that 60-day finisher
[14:51.870 --> 14:56.110]  So don't rely on me to select a phenotype for you grow the plants
[14:56.110 --> 15:00.190]  The one that screams and sings at you is the one that you want. It's a lot like dating
[15:00.230 --> 15:03.510]  You're gonna find the one you'll know if it's not the one for you
[15:03.510 --> 15:06.710]  You guys will let each other know if it is the one for you. You're gonna feel it
[15:06.710 --> 15:08.710]  You're gonna know it so base your phenotype
[15:09.190 --> 15:13.710]  Typical selections off of the plants that work best for you not best for me
[15:13.710 --> 15:17.990]  I've done a lot of work to narrow down the phenotypes that are gonna come out in the out of the seeds
[15:17.990 --> 15:21.150]  I've given you a lot of guidance on what to expect now
[15:21.150 --> 15:23.870]  You've got to select the phenotype that works best for you
[15:23.870 --> 15:27.870]  And I've said this a moment ago this first run with the plants is an audition run
[15:27.870 --> 15:32.530]  This is not the last run you get with these plants. This is the first date. Let's grow them
[15:32.530 --> 15:34.070]  Let's see if we even get a law
[15:34.070 --> 15:38.470]  Let's see how the outcome goes at the end of the flowering cycle chop them down smoke them
[15:38.470 --> 15:40.510]  There might be one in there that is amazing
[15:40.510 --> 15:42.870]  There might be four out of those ten that are useless to you
[15:42.870 --> 15:48.750]  You will know exactly which one you want grow that one again. That is when we're going to start doing all of the tricks
[15:49.350 --> 15:55.410]  That's when you can run the 1113 light cycle if you want to that's when you can run the 18 six light cycle if you want
[15:55.410 --> 15:58.390]  To that's when you can lollipop them. That's when you can trellis them
[15:58.390 --> 16:00.030]  That's when you can work them into a net
[16:00.030 --> 16:05.550]  But let's not waste all that time space and energy on brand new plants that we don't even know what we're messing with
[16:05.550 --> 16:10.230]  We could have all males. We could have a bunch of hermaphrodites. We could have a bunch of weird
[16:10.870 --> 16:18.510]  Mutant plants or you could have amazing keepers. So that is my quick rant on phenotypical selection. This is going to be a quick episode
[16:18.510 --> 16:22.870]  I'm not gonna ramble on and add more to it unnecessarily. I am going to thank you for listening to
