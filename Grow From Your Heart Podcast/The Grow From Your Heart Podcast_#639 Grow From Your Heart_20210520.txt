[00:02.240 --> 00:04.040]  All right, here we go.
[00:04.040 --> 00:05.520]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:05.520 --> 00:11.440]  I'm your host, my friends call me Ross DeJeff, and this is episode 639 of the Grow From Your
[00:11.440 --> 00:12.440]  Heart podcast.
[00:12.440 --> 00:15.520]  In this episode, I'm going to focus on emails.
[00:15.520 --> 00:19.360]  Before we get to those emails, let's do a few shout outs to a few members of the 710
[00:19.360 --> 00:20.360]  Club.

[00:25.120 --> 00:26.480]  level or higher.
[00:26.480 --> 00:30.000]  So with no further ado, let's start off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.

[01:00.360 --> 01:01.360]  Thank you.
[01:01.360 --> 01:04.840]  Shout out to my friend Jethro Earl 710.
[01:04.840 --> 01:09.760]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.

[01:13.400 --> 01:19.640]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:19.640 --> 01:22.040]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:22.040 --> 01:26.540]  And of course, I did include a link in the show notes and the video description to make
[01:26.540 --> 01:28.920]  it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:28.920 --> 01:29.920]  All right.
[01:30.480 --> 01:32.480]  I don't have a lot of stuff to ramble about at the start of the show.
[01:32.480 --> 01:35.440]  Let's jump right into the email portion of the show.
[01:35.440 --> 01:39.880]  This one came to us from a person named Sam and it says you can use my name.
[01:39.880 --> 01:41.760]  That makes things a lot easier for me.
[01:41.760 --> 01:46.840]  I know I can just say this came from Sam and it says I'm a relatively new grower.
[01:46.840 --> 01:47.840]  Thanks to your podcast.
[01:47.840 --> 01:53.600]  It says I'm a disabled veteran with PTSD and a few years ago I began discovering that cannabis
[01:53.600 --> 01:59.480]  is an amazing medicine and is much healthier of an alternative to alcohol.
[02:00.040 --> 02:01.320]  First of all, Sam, thank you for your service.
[02:01.320 --> 02:03.640]  I do appreciate what you've done for the country.
[02:03.640 --> 02:04.640]  You've got some PTSD.
[02:04.640 --> 02:05.640]  I know what that's like.
[02:05.640 --> 02:08.680]  It's probably different PTSD, but it still sucks.
[02:08.680 --> 02:12.680]  So bro, thank you for your service and thank you for the support on the podcast and I'm
[02:12.680 --> 02:14.320]  glad you're growing now.
[02:14.320 --> 02:17.920]  It goes on to say, also, I'm glad you're using cannabis instead of alcohol.
[02:17.920 --> 02:20.200]  I too am a, uh, I'm an alcoholic.
[02:20.200 --> 02:21.680]  I haven't had alcohol in a long time.
[02:21.680 --> 02:22.800]  I'm not tempted by alcohol.
[02:22.800 --> 02:26.980]  I don't desire, crave or need alcohol, but there was a time in my life when alcohol was
[02:26.980 --> 02:30.460]  a serious crutch and I was not the best person I could be.
[02:30.460 --> 02:32.140]  I was kind of an asshole to people around me.
[02:32.140 --> 02:33.140]  I was very irresponsible.
[02:33.140 --> 02:38.220]  I wasn't responsible with my, uh, my words, my actions, my health, uh, my physical or
[02:38.220 --> 02:40.540]  mental wellbeing were not important to me.
[02:40.540 --> 02:44.060]  Come a long way since then and life is much better without that poison in me.
[02:44.060 --> 02:45.420]  I understand the struggle.
[02:45.420 --> 02:47.500]  It was, uh, wasn't the easiest thing to quit.
[02:47.500 --> 02:50.560]  I had to get rid of friends and lifestyle changes and shit.
[02:50.560 --> 02:52.780]  This is not the quit drinking alcohol podcast.
[02:52.780 --> 02:56.860]  I want to sympathize with you and say that I know how that feels and I'm really grateful
[02:56.940 --> 03:00.340]  you've joined us on team cannabis and we've gotten away from team alcohol.
[03:00.340 --> 03:01.340]  Shout out to team cannabis.
[03:01.340 --> 03:02.340]  All right.
[03:02.340 --> 03:03.340]  It keeps going.
[03:03.340 --> 03:08.180]  Uh, I live in a cannabis unfriendly state so I can't afford to continue purchasing free
[03:08.180 --> 03:12.700]  market cannabis after researching for almost a year and finally getting my courage.
[03:12.700 --> 03:17.460]  I planted my first seeds allegedly in the winter of 2018 bro.
[03:17.460 --> 03:18.460]  Congratulations.
[03:18.460 --> 03:23.300]  I'm glad you've stepped up and taken responsibility for your own medicine needs.
[03:23.300 --> 03:27.460]  It says I've used your podcast extensively to do my research and I've learned a great
[03:27.460 --> 03:28.460]  deal from it.
[03:28.460 --> 03:29.460]  Thank you.
[03:29.460 --> 03:30.460]  That means a lot to me.
[03:30.460 --> 03:32.940]  It says, thank you so much for putting it out there.
[03:32.940 --> 03:35.340]  It's going, it's a, it's a given, uh, receive.
[03:35.340 --> 03:36.740]  It's a full exchange is what I'm saying here.
[03:36.740 --> 03:38.740]  It's a give and take and I appreciate it.
[03:38.740 --> 03:44.000]  It says I still listen regularly, regularly, and I have some, and I have since made grow
[03:44.000 --> 03:48.340]  friends in my state through your podcast and the discord server.
[03:48.340 --> 03:51.700]  Big shout out to all of my friends on the discord server for helping out new friends,
[03:51.700 --> 03:54.580]  old friends, making new friends, connecting the community.
[03:54.580 --> 03:55.780]  That is a cool place over there.
[03:55.780 --> 03:57.220]  Check out the discord server.
[03:57.220 --> 03:59.860]  There is a link in the video description.
[03:59.860 --> 04:01.180]  I'm going to keep going.
[04:01.180 --> 04:05.820]  It says cannabis as a medicine is a very well known topic, but I also wanted to mention
[04:05.820 --> 04:10.620]  the therapeutic aspects of the cannabis growing process.
[04:10.620 --> 04:12.060]  I completely agree with this.
[04:12.060 --> 04:15.780]  I want to keep reading, but I already want to say I fully agree with that.
[04:15.780 --> 04:21.900]  It says my garden has become a Haven for me that I use to manage my stress and anxiety.
[04:21.900 --> 04:25.860]  It gives me something to research and learn about when I'm feeling lost in the world and
[04:25.860 --> 04:30.420]  it helps me to know that I'm part of a whole community of other home growers out there
[04:30.420 --> 04:32.720]  that many of them are veterans as well.
[04:32.720 --> 04:35.460]  And I have come as well as I have come to learn.
[04:35.460 --> 04:38.300]  Yes, I love that whole statement.
[04:38.300 --> 04:43.420]  The garden should be your Haven, your safe space, your moment of Zen.
[04:44.420 --> 04:48.460]  I was deeply immersed in the commercial cannabis industry.
[04:48.460 --> 04:54.420]  Since COVID happened, I have basically backed out of all of my commercial cannabis contracts.
[04:54.420 --> 04:56.780]  I'm not working with any facilities right now.
[04:56.780 --> 04:58.220]  I don't go to any big places.
[04:58.220 --> 04:59.220]  And you know what?
[04:59.220 --> 05:01.740]  I've never been more in love with growing cannabis.
[05:01.740 --> 05:06.140]  My personal garden has not looked this good in a long time.
[05:06.140 --> 05:08.660]  I was focused on a cannabis business.
[05:08.660 --> 05:14.180]  I was focused on production, schedules, numbers, weights, potency reports.
[05:14.180 --> 05:17.860]  I was forgetting the thing that I preach all the time, grow from your heart.
[05:17.860 --> 05:21.380]  I was still doing that, but that was like seventh or eighth on the list.
[05:21.380 --> 05:23.100]  It should be number one.
[05:23.100 --> 05:28.380]  Our friend Sam here is growing from his heart because this plant, this grow room is his
[05:28.380 --> 05:29.380]  Zen.
[05:29.380 --> 05:30.380]  It's his new playground.
[05:30.380 --> 05:31.860]  It's the place to go.
[05:31.860 --> 05:32.860]  It's the library.
[05:32.860 --> 05:35.580]  It is the place where he could just go and be himself.
[05:35.580 --> 05:40.260]  I feel like when I go in my garden, I put earbuds in and whatever I'm listening to,
[05:40.260 --> 05:41.540]  that's what I got in my ears.
[05:41.540 --> 05:42.540]  I turn off the phone.
[05:42.540 --> 05:46.180]  I got the phone on in case the daughter, but I don't look like if my daughter calls, I'll
[05:46.180 --> 05:47.180]  answer her.
[05:47.180 --> 05:49.140]  She's about the only one I'm going to answer in the garden.
[05:49.140 --> 05:50.140]  Kids are important.
[05:50.140 --> 05:51.140]  Everybody else, they can wait.
[05:51.140 --> 05:52.140]  I'm in the grow.
[05:52.140 --> 05:53.140]  That is my moment of Zen.
[05:53.140 --> 05:54.140]  That is my time.
[05:54.140 --> 05:55.620]  Those plants need my attention.
[05:55.620 --> 05:59.420]  That garden is relying on me and it's just, it feels so good.
[05:59.420 --> 06:01.100]  It's my quiet space.
[06:01.100 --> 06:02.980]  It smells good.
[06:02.980 --> 06:04.440]  It's beautiful in there.
[06:04.440 --> 06:07.180]  If it's a snowy day outside, it's fucking nice in the garden.
[06:07.180 --> 06:10.800]  If it's a hot day outside, beautiful in the garden.
[06:10.800 --> 06:13.940]  It's always about 78, 79 degrees in there.
[06:13.940 --> 06:15.560]  It's always just the right humidity in there.
[06:15.560 --> 06:19.400]  Just depending on what phase we're in, depending on which room I'm in, but it's never too extreme
[06:19.400 --> 06:20.400]  in the garden.
[06:20.400 --> 06:22.120]  It's beautiful in there and I've got my earbuds in.
[06:22.120 --> 06:26.660]  I either got Joey Diaz yelling at me or Chris DeStefano telling me a dirty joke or fish
[06:26.660 --> 06:28.260]  blaring in my ear.
[06:28.260 --> 06:31.560]  Sometimes it's just dead silent in there and it is beautiful.
[06:31.560 --> 06:32.560]  Nobody can mess with me.
[06:32.560 --> 06:34.000]  Nobody can give me any problems.
[06:34.000 --> 06:40.440]  And then the other thing I talk about and think about is don't think about bills.
[06:40.440 --> 06:41.880]  Don't think about problems.
[06:41.880 --> 06:45.960]  If you've been arguing with somebody, if you fucking had a fight in traffic, if your neighbor's
[06:45.960 --> 06:49.640]  been being a dick, if there's something on your mind, don't carry that into the grow
[06:49.640 --> 06:52.000]  room with you because you're going to put that on the plants and they're going to be
[06:52.000 --> 06:53.440]  stressed out too.
[06:53.440 --> 06:56.960]  So when I go in there, I make it a point to just close the door behind me and all the
[06:56.960 --> 07:02.400]  bullshit out there, all the stuff out here in reality and Babylon gets left out here.
[07:03.240 --> 07:05.440]  Everything in my grow is good vibes, jaw love.
[07:05.440 --> 07:07.000]  We don't think about that stuff.
[07:07.000 --> 07:08.840]  I'm not growing from my wallet.
[07:08.840 --> 07:10.360]  I'm not growing from my ego.
[07:10.360 --> 07:11.800]  I'm not growing for Instagram.
[07:11.800 --> 07:13.640]  I'll share it with Instagram.
[07:13.640 --> 07:17.160]  I'll put some money in my wallet after I grow, but that wasn't the intention.
[07:17.160 --> 07:23.160]  The intention is to see this beautiful plant, this amazing product go from point zero to
[07:23.160 --> 07:28.400]  point harvested, dried, cured, and then either I get to consume it or one of my friends gets
[07:28.400 --> 07:32.560]  to consume it or a medical cannabis consumer gets to consume it, which is all of us.
[07:32.560 --> 07:34.440]  We're all medical cannabis patients.
[07:34.440 --> 07:38.400]  One of us gets to consume that and we're going to feel better.
[07:38.400 --> 07:41.840]  Most of the time I feel good, but when I smoke, I feel even better.
[07:41.840 --> 07:46.880]  And then when I don't feel good and I smoke, then I can feel good and then even better.
[07:46.880 --> 07:48.440]  So this plant is very therapeutic.
[07:48.440 --> 07:52.080]  It shouldn't be thought of as a commodity, as a product.
[07:52.080 --> 07:55.360]  It should be working all the way from the beginning to the end.
[07:55.360 --> 07:57.720]  It should be building you up and making you feel good.
[07:57.720 --> 07:58.800]  Don't let it get stressful.
[07:58.800 --> 08:01.920]  That's part of why I walked away from the large scale commercial industry.
[08:01.920 --> 08:06.800]  I could go back, I could do that, but I'm at a point where it was getting more stressful
[08:06.800 --> 08:11.880]  than it was feeling rewarding and just having my personal grow, my personal business.
[08:11.880 --> 08:13.800]  It's really, there's more passion in it.
[08:13.800 --> 08:14.800]  I enjoy it.
[08:14.800 --> 08:16.540]  I'm back to growing from my heart.
[08:16.540 --> 08:20.840]  Every plant I touch is grown with full love because I could touch every plant now.
[08:20.840 --> 08:22.080]  I can address every plant.
[08:22.080 --> 08:24.840]  I don't have to tell somebody, go water those, I'll water these.
[08:24.840 --> 08:26.840]  We'll hope they all get watered by the end of the day.
[08:26.960 --> 08:27.960]  There's no stress.
[08:27.960 --> 08:30.400]  I'm back to growing pure with love from my heart.
[08:30.400 --> 08:34.080]  It's all about the love and the enjoyment now, which I think will make all the products
[08:34.080 --> 08:35.400]  better as well.
[08:35.400 --> 08:38.080]  So I want to get back into this.
[08:38.080 --> 08:39.080]  Don't think about your money.
[08:39.080 --> 08:40.480]  Don't think about your wallet.
[08:40.480 --> 08:43.200]  Don't think about how chicks are going to like you because you got weed.
[08:43.200 --> 08:46.320]  Don't think about the drum set or the guitar or the sneakers or the car you're going to
[08:46.320 --> 08:49.440]  buy, the video games you're going to buy when you sell that product.
[08:49.440 --> 08:50.640]  Don't think about that stuff.
[08:50.640 --> 08:53.360]  Think about, it's like a meditation.
[08:53.360 --> 08:56.820]  You start off with the seed that doesn't have, it's got life in this little ball and you
[08:56.820 --> 08:58.700]  brought it all the way to fruition.
[08:58.700 --> 09:00.500]  You get to harvest it and smoke it.
[09:00.500 --> 09:04.940]  That's weeks and weeks of nurturing and meditation and growing you get to spend with that plant.
[09:04.940 --> 09:08.900]  Then while you're doing that, you're also meeting this whole group of people that we've
[09:08.900 --> 09:10.860]  talked about, the cannabis community.
[09:10.860 --> 09:13.620]  You think, well, I wonder if my plants are doing okay.
[09:13.620 --> 09:17.540]  So you go to the internet just to compare your plants to others or to get advice.
[09:17.540 --> 09:20.300]  And then you find this guy, Rasta Jeff, and then you realize he's approachable.
[09:20.300 --> 09:21.300]  I can make friends with him.
[09:21.300 --> 09:25.140]  And then you realize he's got a whole group of people that hang out with them and made
[09:25.140 --> 09:28.260]  him a discord server and you can chat with everybody in there.
[09:28.260 --> 09:33.500]  And so then not only do you have these plants that are a Zen, meditative, therapeutic, and
[09:33.500 --> 09:37.860]  then rewarding, but then you make friends in a community that are also therapeutic,
[09:37.860 --> 09:39.260]  rewarding.
[09:39.260 --> 09:40.780]  Having friends is very rewarding.
[09:40.780 --> 09:41.780]  We're social creatures.
[09:41.780 --> 09:42.780]  At least I am.
[09:42.780 --> 09:44.580]  I can't shut the fuck up and I love having friends.
[09:44.580 --> 09:46.300]  So it does build a great thing.
[09:46.300 --> 09:49.540]  Being in the garden, the cannabis plant, the cannabis community is amazing.
[09:49.540 --> 09:52.540]  You guys already knew that I'm rambling, but this message meant a lot to me.
[09:52.540 --> 09:54.900]  We kind of get far from the point here.
[09:55.660 --> 09:56.660]  Sometimes we forget our roots, forget our goals.
[09:56.660 --> 10:02.180]  I wanted to go back and remind myself and you guys that we're growing medicine to nourish
[10:02.180 --> 10:05.100]  ourselves, our bodies, our minds, our spirits, however you're taking it.
[10:05.100 --> 10:06.900]  I get all three from it.
[10:06.900 --> 10:08.380]  My body feels better when I smoke.
[10:08.380 --> 10:09.380]  My mind feels better.
[10:09.380 --> 10:11.140]  And of course I use it at Rastafari.
[10:11.140 --> 10:14.820]  I use it for meditation, use it for enjoyment, mind, body, spirit.
[10:14.820 --> 10:17.380]  Everything is feeling better from consuming cannabis.
[10:17.380 --> 10:22.380]  We've got to remember to grow from our hearts and not let this plant be a commodity, be
[10:22.380 --> 10:23.980]  a profit, be a product.
[10:24.060 --> 10:28.220]  I understand we have commercial facilities and it is, but go back to your roots.
[10:28.220 --> 10:30.100]  Fall in love with this plant again like I have.
[10:30.100 --> 10:33.980]  I never lost my love, but I mean, now that I've given up the commercial thing, I've got
[10:33.980 --> 10:36.180]  more time to really love these plants again.
[10:36.180 --> 10:41.740]  I'm not thinking about time clocks and employees and schedules and fucking deliveries and manifests
[10:41.740 --> 10:43.900]  and fucking metric numbers.
[10:43.900 --> 10:45.540]  And I don't mean like the metric system.
[10:45.540 --> 10:50.100]  I mean metric, the marijuana enforcement tracking and regulation, something that we use here
[10:50.100 --> 10:51.620]  in Colorado and many other states.
[10:52.180 --> 10:55.500]  It's one of the worst damn programs ever designed and it makes people want to punch themselves
[10:55.500 --> 10:57.420]  in the face repeatedly over and over all day.
[10:57.420 --> 11:00.420]  And I don't have to mess with that because I'm not in the commercial environment.
[11:00.420 --> 11:02.020]  More time to love the plants.
[11:02.020 --> 11:04.020]  Sam, you got me rambling, bro.
[11:04.020 --> 11:05.020]  Thank you.
[11:05.020 --> 11:07.540]  There is more to this message.
[11:07.540 --> 11:08.740]  Excuse me for that kombucha burp.
[11:08.740 --> 11:10.300]  I hope the microphone didn't pick it up.
[11:10.300 --> 11:11.940]  Not even going to edit because I'm human.
[11:11.940 --> 11:12.940]  It goes on.
[11:12.940 --> 11:16.320]  It says there are times when my mental state is in the dumps and the only thing I look
[11:16.320 --> 11:19.660]  forward to is trimming or watering or making edibles.
[11:19.700 --> 11:23.380]  Yeah, that is a lot of why I quit consuming alcohol.
[11:23.380 --> 11:27.660]  I was trying to grow and also drinking and I would go out and get shitty drunk and you
[11:27.660 --> 11:30.340]  forget that night that you got shit to do in the morning, right?
[11:30.340 --> 11:33.780]  And you get shitty drunk and you wake up and you go throw up and you think I'm going to
[11:33.780 --> 11:35.260]  poop some blood and go back to sleep.
[11:35.260 --> 11:38.340]  But then you realize, should I got a garden to go take care of and you got to go play
[11:38.340 --> 11:40.500]  in the grow room hungover?
[11:40.500 --> 11:41.580]  No thank you, bro.
[11:41.580 --> 11:44.940]  I would much rather grow cannabis sober, not hungover.
[11:44.940 --> 11:46.140]  No, let's get in there.
[11:46.140 --> 11:50.740]  I mean, I said sober, but trust me, there are dabs and blunts and joints and bong rips.
[11:50.740 --> 11:52.380]  All those things are happening.
[11:52.380 --> 11:53.380]  That's all acceptable.
[11:53.380 --> 11:54.420]  I'm not getting drunk anymore.
[11:54.420 --> 11:57.660]  I can't be in a grow room drunk, be under grow lights hungover.
[11:57.660 --> 11:59.860]  No effing thank you.
[11:59.860 --> 12:05.540]  So yeah, that contributed a lot to me being a non-alcohol consumer.
[12:05.540 --> 12:06.540]  And you're right.
[12:06.540 --> 12:09.860]  Having those beautiful plants in there to wake up to, it's like having pets that aren't
[12:09.860 --> 12:11.500]  going to shit on the floor and run away.
[12:11.500 --> 12:12.780]  It really is.
[12:12.780 --> 12:15.100]  My plants have never shit on the floor.
[12:15.100 --> 12:17.260]  I've had plenty of dog shit right on the floor.
[12:17.260 --> 12:21.220]  So yes, when the mental state is in the dumps, sometimes knowing that those plants relying
[12:21.220 --> 12:23.100]  on me, it really does help me out.
[12:23.100 --> 12:25.580]  And I seem like an upbeat, positive, happy go lucky dude.
[12:25.580 --> 12:30.340]  I've got a traumatic brain injury that sometimes there are some dark, dumpy days for me.
[12:30.340 --> 12:31.340]  And you're right.
[12:31.340 --> 12:34.460]  Being in the garden for a couple of hours, I'll go in there thinking I fucking hate the
[12:34.460 --> 12:35.460]  world.
[12:35.460 --> 12:36.460]  I don't want to talk to anybody.
[12:36.460 --> 12:37.960]  And then I'll come out being like, I'm going to call some friends and hang out because
[12:37.960 --> 12:39.140]  life is good.
[12:39.140 --> 12:40.820]  The garden is very therapeutic.
[12:40.820 --> 12:44.100]  Spending time with all that living stuff in there, it is very therapeutic.
[12:44.100 --> 12:48.900]  But don't forget to get some real nature sometimes as well.
[12:48.900 --> 12:49.900]  There's more to this.
[12:49.900 --> 12:53.380]  I didn't realize when I started growing that it would be a tool for me in so many ways.
[12:53.380 --> 12:55.300]  It is such a tool in so many ways.
[12:55.300 --> 13:00.100]  The thing you didn't mention that I think you'll discover next in your growing adventure
[13:00.100 --> 13:03.660]  is that now that you're taking good care of these plants and feeding the plants carefully,
[13:03.660 --> 13:09.380]  the next thing that will fall in line is you'll start taking better care of yourself physically,
[13:09.380 --> 13:11.860]  health wise, what you consume, what you eat.
[13:11.860 --> 13:15.540]  You'll start thinking about the products you eat better, but not only the things you
[13:15.540 --> 13:19.260]  eat, but where they came from, how they were made, how they were sourced.
[13:19.260 --> 13:22.020]  You'll start, it'll just be, you'll get more aware.
[13:22.020 --> 13:24.900]  You're going to get woke because you're growing weed and it's going to help you out.
[13:24.900 --> 13:25.900]  It's going to be good for you.
[13:25.900 --> 13:31.340]  You're already getting a mental boost from this, which is giving you a spiritual boost
[13:31.340 --> 13:32.340]  from this.
[13:32.340 --> 13:35.140]  The next thing you're going to get is a physical learning lesson.
[13:35.140 --> 13:41.300]  You're going to realize why do I spend so much time measuring precise millimeters, milliliters
[13:41.300 --> 13:42.580]  for products to feed my plants?
[13:42.580 --> 13:46.820]  But when it comes time for my dinner, I slap fucking butter and fucking cheese, a bunch
[13:46.820 --> 13:49.940]  of shit in a pan and eat it like I'm fucking going to live through anything.
[13:49.940 --> 13:53.900]  You'll start thinking, well, maybe if I give myself the appropriate shit, maybe I'll thrive
[13:53.900 --> 13:54.900]  like my plants do.
[13:54.900 --> 13:57.620]  And it all click in you one day and you'll go, huh, that's why I felt like shit because
[13:57.620 --> 13:59.740]  I was just eating fucking all the wrong shit.
[13:59.740 --> 14:04.180]  So that's the next thing you're going to realize, I think, when it comes to your cannabis adventure.
[14:04.180 --> 14:07.780]  I know this is a really off topic kind of a message, but you guys, I really feel this
[14:07.780 --> 14:08.780]  is the way it goes.
[14:08.780 --> 14:11.060]  You start learning about cannabis, you get that connection.
[14:11.820 --> 14:12.820]  And then you say, I'm feeding my plants.
[14:12.820 --> 14:13.820]  I should feed myself.
[14:13.820 --> 14:17.380]  I see it happen, especially in commercial growers because they're in the grow all day,
[14:17.380 --> 14:18.380]  bust an ass.
[14:18.380 --> 14:19.380]  They got to work harder.
[14:19.380 --> 14:20.660]  They got to eat more and they see it.
[14:20.660 --> 14:21.660]  They just see the thing.
[14:21.660 --> 14:24.740]  Also, I'm in there talking about how eat well and maybe that inspires them.
[14:24.740 --> 14:26.700]  But that's your next move, dude.
[14:26.700 --> 14:30.140]  It's been great for your mental health.
[14:30.140 --> 14:34.620]  My therapist and I have even discovered that oftentimes when I'm lacking in caring for
[14:34.620 --> 14:39.500]  my mental health, I'm lacking in taking care of my grow area as well.
[14:39.500 --> 14:41.500]  Isn't that how it's a reflection?
[14:41.500 --> 14:43.900]  The way you do something is the way you do everything.
[14:43.900 --> 14:48.580]  And when that mental state starts going fucking haywire, the garden starts showing it.
[14:48.580 --> 14:51.460]  It really reflects the whole life starts looking like it's unraveled.
[14:51.460 --> 14:53.380]  And then you go, hi, everything's out of control.
[14:53.380 --> 14:54.860]  I got to get my shit together.
[14:54.860 --> 14:56.860]  You go clean up the garden, start cleaning up your life.
[14:56.860 --> 14:57.860]  And then guess what?
[14:57.860 --> 14:59.380]  You start having better conversations.
[14:59.380 --> 15:00.380]  Your mind is more open.
[15:00.380 --> 15:01.380]  You're more free.
[15:01.380 --> 15:04.180]  You start actually wanting to go places because your brain feels good.
[15:04.180 --> 15:05.620]  You want to be around people.
[15:05.620 --> 15:07.060]  It will spark that for you.
[15:07.060 --> 15:08.940]  I agree completely.
[15:09.380 --> 15:14.420]  So my grow area has become sort of a metaphor in my life that I can use for measuring as
[15:14.420 --> 15:16.580]  a measuring stick for taking care of myself.
[15:16.580 --> 15:20.380]  Yes, my friend, if that garden starts getting out of control, you got to reach out to a
[15:20.380 --> 15:22.060]  friend and say, hey, why am I doing this?
[15:22.060 --> 15:24.700]  Or maybe just reach inside of yourself and say, what am I lacking?
[15:24.700 --> 15:26.140]  What am I fucking up on?
[15:26.140 --> 15:27.300]  Why am I hating the world?
[15:27.300 --> 15:28.300]  Why am I hiding?
[15:28.300 --> 15:29.940]  Why am I being a recluse again?
[15:29.940 --> 15:30.940]  Get it going.
[15:30.940 --> 15:32.400]  Maybe call a friend.
[15:32.400 --> 15:33.400]  Maybe not.
[15:33.400 --> 15:34.400]  I don't know.
[15:34.400 --> 15:35.400]  Maybe do your thing.
[15:35.400 --> 15:36.680]  Maybe sometimes calling a friend isn't the best thing to do when you're in the dumps.
[15:36.680 --> 15:37.940]  Maybe just drag them down too.
[15:37.940 --> 15:39.220]  But you know how to get yourself out of it.
[15:39.220 --> 15:42.300]  Go in that grow, take care of business and feel the pride of the grow.
[15:42.300 --> 15:43.740]  Then smoke a fat one.
[15:43.740 --> 15:48.740]  He wraps it up with all of that to say, learning how to grow from your podcast has been a life-changing
[15:48.740 --> 15:51.660]  experience for me and I can't thank you enough.
[15:51.660 --> 15:54.100]  Sam, this message was life-changing to me.
[15:54.100 --> 15:55.700]  I get messages like this frequently.
[15:55.700 --> 15:59.420]  I get a lot of messages, but they never stop warming my heart.
[15:59.420 --> 16:01.420]  They never stop filling me with pride.
[16:01.420 --> 16:05.620]  They never stop making me feel good about what I do.
[16:05.620 --> 16:10.300]  Knowing that I'm helping you out with your PTSD, knowing that we, not just me, you, my
[16:10.300 --> 16:15.740]  guidance, my advice has led you to help yourself with your PTSD and get your mental health
[16:15.740 --> 16:16.740]  on track.
[16:16.740 --> 16:17.740]  So thank you, bro.
[16:17.740 --> 16:21.120]  This sort of stuff is like grow nutrients for me.
[16:21.120 --> 16:22.540]  You just gave me a bloom booster.
[16:22.540 --> 16:24.260]  You just gave me some recharge.
[16:24.260 --> 16:26.280]  Keep me going for a few more episodes.
[16:26.280 --> 16:27.280]  Thank you, bro.
[16:27.280 --> 16:28.280]  I appreciate that.
[16:28.280 --> 16:31.060]  And again, if you're ever in the dumps, bro, and you need somebody to talk to, I'm a busy
[16:31.060 --> 16:32.060]  guy.
[16:32.060 --> 16:33.060]  I got a lot of shit going on.
[16:33.060 --> 16:36.340]  If you ever messaged and said, I'm having a fucking dark day and need a friend, I'll
[16:36.340 --> 16:38.100]  bring you some fucking sunshine, bro.
[16:38.100 --> 16:39.100]  Never fear.
[16:39.100 --> 16:40.100]  Don't be shy.
[16:40.100 --> 16:42.020]  And that goes to just about everybody out there.
[16:42.020 --> 16:45.660]  If you tell me I'm having a dark day and shit's weird, we'll hang out for a minute.
[16:45.660 --> 16:46.660]  Don't worry.
[16:46.660 --> 16:47.660]  All right.
[16:47.660 --> 16:48.660]  I've got a lot more messages in front of me.
[16:48.660 --> 16:49.860]  I've been going for a long time.
[16:49.860 --> 16:53.720]  I want to make sure to cover as much as I can in this episode.
[16:53.720 --> 16:54.720]  This is a great one.
[16:54.720 --> 16:56.860]  This one comes from my friend, Zachary Yu.
[16:56.860 --> 16:57.860]  What up, Zachary?
[16:57.860 --> 16:59.360]  Thank you for the great message.
[16:59.360 --> 17:02.180]  This one goes, I've got a great question for you.
[17:02.180 --> 17:07.220]  Do you grow your competitor's seeds for either quality control standards, calling bullshit,
[17:07.220 --> 17:09.100]  or just plain fun?
[17:09.100 --> 17:10.620]  That's a great question.
[17:10.620 --> 17:12.180]  The short answer is yeah, bro.
[17:12.180 --> 17:14.860]  I love to grow my competitor's seeds.
[17:14.860 --> 17:17.700]  But the thing is, I'm not going to call them competitors.
[17:17.700 --> 17:22.100]  Let's call them colleagues, my friends, my breeding bros.
[17:22.100 --> 17:24.280]  I don't find them to be competition.
[17:24.280 --> 17:25.360]  We all have businesses.
[17:25.360 --> 17:26.500]  We all want to sell seeds.
[17:26.500 --> 17:28.920]  We all want to fucking make sales and do business.
[17:28.920 --> 17:31.340]  But that's not what it's all about.
[17:31.500 --> 17:36.700]  If a client or a customer came to me and they said, hey, I want this strain, and they list
[17:36.700 --> 17:40.860]  off a few details, and that strain is not in my menu, which it probably is because I
[17:40.860 --> 17:43.260]  have a vast menu with a lot of things and I know it pretty well.
[17:43.260 --> 17:47.980]  But if you say I want something and I don't have it, I'll recommend something from another
[17:47.980 --> 17:53.860]  breeder because that is my job as a responsible grower, as a responsible community leader,
[17:53.860 --> 17:56.440]  just as a fucking polite person.
[17:56.440 --> 17:57.440]  And people have seen me do it.
[17:57.440 --> 17:59.620]  And they've been like, bro, that person would have bought seeds from you.
[17:59.900 --> 18:02.620]  I could be like, yeah, they would have bought seeds, but they would not have gotten what
[18:02.620 --> 18:04.580]  they wanted and they would have wasted their money.
[18:04.580 --> 18:06.680]  And at harvest time, they would have been like, man, fuck that guy.
[18:06.680 --> 18:08.180]  He sold me the wrong shit.
[18:08.180 --> 18:11.980]  Instead, they went and got the seeds they wanted from one of my friends who's not a
[18:11.980 --> 18:12.980]  competitor.
[18:12.980 --> 18:13.980]  They're a colleague.
[18:13.980 --> 18:14.980]  We're all in the same gang.
[18:14.980 --> 18:15.980]  We're all in team cannabis.
[18:15.980 --> 18:18.320]  They went and got the seeds they wanted from somebody.
[18:18.320 --> 18:19.320]  They grew them.
[18:19.320 --> 18:20.460]  And now they made two friends.
[18:20.460 --> 18:22.540]  They said, damn, these seeds are fucking cool.
[18:22.540 --> 18:24.780]  And I'm glad that guy, Rasta Jeff, recommended me those.
[18:24.780 --> 18:28.140]  He could have taken my hundred bucks and fucked me and just gave me something.
[18:28.140 --> 18:33.060]  But instead, he said, go over there and visit Duke Diamond or go visit Ethos or Miss Jill
[18:33.060 --> 18:35.020]  because they've got what you're asking for.
[18:35.020 --> 18:36.020]  And he doesn't.
[18:36.020 --> 18:37.540]  I find that to be the way to operate.
[18:37.540 --> 18:38.940]  They're not my competitors.
[18:38.940 --> 18:39.940]  They are my friends.
[18:39.940 --> 18:41.680]  We message each other on social media.
[18:41.680 --> 18:42.680]  We talk.
[18:42.680 --> 18:43.760]  We see each other at all of the events.
[18:43.760 --> 18:45.160]  We travel.
[18:45.160 --> 18:46.460]  We're all doing the same thing.
[18:46.460 --> 18:48.820]  We live and learn with each other.
[18:48.820 --> 18:52.140]  There are weird rivalries and some people don't talk to each other.
[18:52.140 --> 18:55.980]  And I'd rather just not be friends with some people, but I don't got no bickering, no hate
[18:55.980 --> 18:57.220]  or no nothing like that.
[18:57.300 --> 18:58.460]  I don't talk shit about anybody.
[18:58.460 --> 19:00.980]  I don't have hatred for any other breeder out there.
[19:00.980 --> 19:02.340]  If they don't like me, that's cool.
[19:02.340 --> 19:03.340]  That's on them.
[19:03.340 --> 19:04.340]  I'm down to be cool.
[19:04.340 --> 19:05.340]  All the beef is over, in my opinion.
[19:05.340 --> 19:06.700]  I'm fucking too old for that dumb shit.
[19:06.700 --> 19:09.220]  It's not high school is what I think I'm getting at.
[19:09.220 --> 19:10.740]  I'm down with all the breeders.
[19:10.740 --> 19:13.140]  They got nothing but love and respect coming from me.
[19:13.140 --> 19:19.140]  So I do grow out their stuff because where all what, like that's where seeds come from.
[19:19.140 --> 19:22.780]  If I keep growing all of my stuff, I'm just going to be growing my stuff.
[19:22.780 --> 19:26.140]  So I've got to introduce other things into the garden or I bottleneck my breeding.
[19:26.140 --> 19:28.380]  So where else is other stuff going to come from?
[19:28.380 --> 19:29.380]  Other breeders.
[19:29.380 --> 19:34.000]  So yeah, I do breed and grow and test run other breeders stuff.
[19:34.000 --> 19:35.200]  Sometimes I'm amazed.
[19:35.200 --> 19:37.080]  Sometimes I'm fucking amazed.
[19:37.080 --> 19:38.080]  Sometimes I'm amazed.
[19:38.080 --> 19:41.020]  I'm like, I paid money for this shit and other people are paying money for this shit.
[19:41.020 --> 19:44.620]  And there's not a fucking whole thread of hate speech on the fucking internet about
[19:44.620 --> 19:47.100]  this person after paying good money for these seeds.
[19:47.100 --> 19:48.300]  I don't go and bash anybody.
[19:48.300 --> 19:49.300]  I don't talk that shit.
[19:49.300 --> 19:50.700]  That's not my place.
[19:50.700 --> 19:56.140]  If I were to say that fucking anything I say, if I were to say that seed company, and I
[19:56.140 --> 19:59.180]  don't want to make up numbers because there's probably a seed company called that right
[19:59.180 --> 20:00.180]  now.
[20:00.180 --> 20:04.100]  If fucking Mac book seed company sold me seeds and they sucked, it wouldn't do me any good
[20:04.100 --> 20:07.660]  to go online and say Mac book seed company sold me Herms.
[20:07.660 --> 20:10.240]  That just looks like I'm trying to big up my company.
[20:10.240 --> 20:12.500]  So there's no need to bash it.
[20:12.500 --> 20:14.540]  I just don't talk about it when I do get a keeper.
[20:14.540 --> 20:18.300]  When I do get a champion, I'm not afraid to share that with you.
[20:18.300 --> 20:20.120]  Recently I grew the Jack the Ripper seeds.
[20:20.120 --> 20:21.480]  I got some Jack the Ripper seeds.
[20:21.480 --> 20:22.760]  A shout out to sub cool.
[20:22.760 --> 20:25.920]  Shout out to all of the team TGA team, green Avengers.
[20:25.920 --> 20:29.720]  I shout out to the people keeping the name alive.
[20:29.720 --> 20:33.760]  But I grew some sub cool stuff because sub cool was one of my heroes.
[20:33.760 --> 20:37.480]  Like it's weird as a 40 year old guy to talk about your heroes, but without sub cool and
[20:37.480 --> 20:39.880]  TGA genetics, I wouldn't be I read genetics.
[20:39.880 --> 20:42.880]  Ross to Jeff would just be some random fucking basement grower.
[20:42.880 --> 20:43.880]  Who knows?
[20:43.880 --> 20:44.880]  I'd be a musician.
[20:44.880 --> 20:45.880]  Probably you would have never heard of me.
[20:45.880 --> 20:48.120]  I'd be up struggling ass musician or a fake comedian.
[20:48.120 --> 20:49.360]  I'd be a standup comic.
[20:49.360 --> 20:50.800]  That's what I would do.
[20:50.800 --> 20:54.040]  But without sub cool and TGA, I wouldn't be here.
[20:54.040 --> 20:57.880]  So when sub cool passed away, rest in peace, subby, big respect, nothing but love.
[20:57.880 --> 21:02.920]  But when sub passed away, it was my duty to make some crosses in honor of sub cool.
[21:02.920 --> 21:07.000]  So I bought the I didn't buy, I was given, honestly, I was gifted some Jack the Ripper
[21:07.000 --> 21:08.880]  seeds from a member of TGA.
[21:08.880 --> 21:11.320]  Shout out to the person who gave those to me.
[21:11.320 --> 21:13.160]  They don't need any controversy, so I won't say their name.
[21:13.160 --> 21:16.240]  We don't need to start all the emails, but I got some TGA seeds from a friend.
[21:16.240 --> 21:17.240]  I grew them.
[21:17.240 --> 21:18.320]  I found my keepers and I bred to them.
[21:18.320 --> 21:21.760]  So that's a prime example of growing.
[21:21.760 --> 21:26.320]  People would consider TGA a competitor, but that was a friend, a colleague, a partner,
[21:26.320 --> 21:27.360]  a teammate.
[21:27.360 --> 21:29.040]  We're all on team cannabis.
[21:29.040 --> 21:30.480]  We're all on legalization.
[21:30.480 --> 21:32.600]  We're all on the green team.
[21:32.600 --> 21:33.600]  We want it.
[21:33.600 --> 21:36.620]  We all want the same for the customer, the client, the community.
[21:36.620 --> 21:40.760]  We want you guys to get a successful seed, grow a successful plant, have a happy harvest,
[21:40.760 --> 21:42.320]  a successful outcome.
[21:42.320 --> 21:44.160]  So I don't find it.
[21:44.160 --> 21:48.240]  And I know you're asking if I grow out competitor seeds and I'm focusing more on the word competitors
[21:49.160 --> 21:53.640]  Mr. Soul said at one time, like we're all musicians and we're all in different bands.
[21:53.640 --> 21:55.680]  And maybe you like reggae.
[21:55.680 --> 21:56.940]  Maybe you like country music.
[21:56.940 --> 21:59.120]  Maybe you like fucking pop hits from the eighties.
[21:59.120 --> 22:01.640]  Maybe you're into fucking Norwegian death metal.
[22:01.640 --> 22:05.280]  There's a breeder out there that offers something for you that you're into.
[22:05.280 --> 22:08.240]  And every breeder just develops their own following.
[22:08.240 --> 22:10.800]  They get their own click, their own niche, their own certain type of people.
[22:10.800 --> 22:12.680]  And it's all about the vibe that they present.
[22:12.680 --> 22:18.680]  So yeah, I do love to grow other seeds from other breeders.
[22:18.680 --> 22:22.360]  Not for calling bullshit or QC standards, just because I like to grow cannabis.
[22:22.360 --> 22:24.400]  I want to see like what they've got to offer.
[22:24.400 --> 22:26.840]  I see a breeder say, Hey, I've got this coming out.
[22:26.840 --> 22:28.120]  And I'm like, Oh, I've been watching you.
[22:28.120 --> 22:31.000]  And I know those two parents, I'm kind of curious what that's going to do.
[22:31.000 --> 22:34.600]  I'll buy a pack and run it just for fun, just to see what it does.
[22:34.600 --> 22:38.000]  Sometimes I'll buy a pack and give it to a friend and let them run it just to see what
[22:38.000 --> 22:39.720]  it does because I'm that kind of guy.
[22:39.720 --> 22:40.720]  I'm very curious.
[22:40.760 --> 22:44.720]  I'm passionately curious, especially when it comes to cannabis, but also I don't have
[22:44.720 --> 22:45.720]  a bunch of room.
[22:45.720 --> 22:48.480]  So if I've got a friend with some open space, you know who you are, bro.
[22:48.480 --> 22:51.400]  Shout out for running seedlings for me and finding us some keepers.
[22:51.400 --> 22:54.560]  I just throw seedlings to other people and they run shit for me to find us stuff.
[22:54.560 --> 22:56.880]  And then I go visit and check out what they've got.
[22:56.880 --> 22:58.200]  I help them pick keepers.
[22:58.200 --> 23:02.400]  And sometimes we disagree, which means I get one keeper, they get the other, cut a clone.
[23:02.400 --> 23:03.720]  I take one home, they get another.
[23:03.720 --> 23:05.840]  We both got what we wanted, but we got two different plants.
[23:05.840 --> 23:06.880]  I got more breeding stock.
[23:06.880 --> 23:08.520]  They got growing stock.
[23:08.520 --> 23:09.840]  I'm rambling on that part.
[23:10.560 --> 23:11.080]  Yeah, bro.
[23:11.080 --> 23:14.880]  I love growing other seed breeders stuff.
[23:14.880 --> 23:16.560]  That's how I find stuff for breeding.
[23:16.560 --> 23:24.440]  I'm growing the Chemdala Chem right now, which is Chem D to I-95 from, fucking geez, that
[23:24.440 --> 23:26.080]  one's from JJ from Top Dog, right?
[23:26.080 --> 23:27.080]  Yeah.
[23:27.080 --> 23:28.080]  Geez, I almost forgot who that shit was from.
[23:28.080 --> 23:29.080]  I apologize for that.
[23:29.080 --> 23:30.560]  I got so many seeds, I fucking get lost.
[23:30.560 --> 23:31.920]  But I'm growing that one right now.
[23:31.920 --> 23:33.600]  It came from seed and it is fire.
[23:33.600 --> 23:36.280]  That's a breeder, that's a keeper, it's been bred to.
[23:36.280 --> 23:37.880]  So that's where that came from.
[23:37.920 --> 23:40.280]  Most about everything I've got came from a seed eventually.
[23:40.280 --> 23:42.000]  All plants came from a seed.
[23:42.000 --> 23:46.640]  So the Platinum Tangy that I grow, that was a seed from Garden of Weden.
[23:46.640 --> 23:49.240]  Somebody else found that, but I mean, that came from Garden of Weden.
[23:49.240 --> 23:53.240]  The Strawberry Starburst, or the strawberry fields I used to make Strawberry Starburst
[23:53.240 --> 23:55.880]  was a seed that started off as a Crockett seed.
[23:55.880 --> 23:59.920]  I acquired the clone at a commercial grow, but in the long run, they're all seeds.
[23:59.920 --> 24:01.560]  So they all started from a seed.
[24:01.560 --> 24:03.400]  I'm rambling like a motherfucker on that answer.
[24:03.400 --> 24:05.400]  Now the answer is yes, bro.
[24:05.400 --> 24:06.960]  I do grow other people's seeds.
[24:06.960 --> 24:08.080]  I love doing it.
[24:08.080 --> 24:11.840]  I like to compare, I like to start my seeds and their seeds at the same time.
[24:11.840 --> 24:14.720]  Compare germ rates, compare growth rates, just see what's going on.
[24:14.720 --> 24:18.000]  There are a lot of reasons to do them, mainly because it's fun and that's how I get some
[24:18.000 --> 24:19.280]  new shit to breed with.
[24:19.280 --> 24:22.100]  All right, this is going to be a quick Thursday episode.
[24:22.100 --> 24:24.800]  This next email I've got is going to take way too long for this show.
[24:24.800 --> 24:26.280]  So I'm going to start wrapping it up here.
[24:26.280 --> 24:31.960]  I want to thank you guys for listening to episode 639 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[24:31.960 --> 24:34.520]  I've got some cool stuff planned coming up in a couple of episodes.
[24:34.520 --> 24:37.760]  I don't want to make any, I don't want my big mouth to write any checks.
[24:37.760 --> 24:40.400]  My skinny ass can't cash, cash.
[24:40.400 --> 24:41.400]  You know what I'm saying?
[24:41.400 --> 24:43.360]  But I got some good shit planned for you.
[24:43.360 --> 24:44.640]  I hope I can pull it off.
[24:44.640 --> 24:46.320]  I'm excited to get it going.
[24:46.320 --> 24:47.820]  So I'm going to wrap this one up quickly.
[24:47.820 --> 24:51.400]  I can start working on that next episode, get some ideas, some notes going.
[24:51.400 --> 24:52.400]  I may have to move a camera.
[24:52.400 --> 24:54.120]  I may have to use a different microphone.
[24:54.120 --> 24:56.160]  I've got some fun ideas you guys are going to enjoy.
[24:56.160 --> 24:59.560]  I've already said too much.

[25:50.460 --> 25:52.380]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.

[26:02.820 --> 26:03.540]  Bye.
