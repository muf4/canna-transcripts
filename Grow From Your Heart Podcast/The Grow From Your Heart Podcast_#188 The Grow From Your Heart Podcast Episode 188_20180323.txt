[02:43.220 --> 02:44.180]  So let's get into the show.
[02:44.180 --> 02:44.700]  Here we go.
[02:46.180 --> 02:50.220]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I have officially pressed record.
[02:50.220 --> 02:51.940]  We're hanging out with two of my good friends.
[02:52.140 --> 02:53.420]  We're hanging out with a tall Clint.
[02:53.420 --> 02:55.060]  Clint Stewart. He's been here on the show before.
[02:55.100 --> 02:57.380]  Hey, guys. He was the the cannabis amateur.
[02:57.540 --> 03:00.620]  Yeah, the cannabis, the non cannabis, not even an amateur.
[03:00.740 --> 03:03.300]  Yeah. The other guy on the other side of the table is my good buddy,
[03:03.820 --> 03:05.500]  Wade Ridley. So what's up, bro? Word.
[03:07.180 --> 03:08.500]  I don't know that Wade's an amateur.
[03:08.500 --> 03:10.340]  I wouldn't call him a professional.
[03:10.340 --> 03:12.580]  Wade can smoke. Yeah, Wade can smoke.
[03:12.580 --> 03:14.420]  But he's not he's not a level 10 black.
[03:14.420 --> 03:15.220]  No, I am not.
[03:16.140 --> 03:19.700]  Both of these guys are local, aspiring comedians.
[03:19.700 --> 03:21.020]  They're also my bros.
[03:21.020 --> 03:24.260]  We brought tall Clint back because I really liked having him ask
[03:24.740 --> 03:26.140]  cannabis one on one questions.
[03:26.140 --> 03:28.540]  It was kind of the crowd demanded you back, bro.
[03:28.580 --> 03:30.660]  I appreciate it, guys. Thanks for calling me back.
[03:32.020 --> 03:35.180]  Applause. That was the wind of the dusty city.
[03:35.180 --> 03:37.860]  Yeah, it was. I felt it over here.
[03:37.860 --> 03:39.180]  Let me tell you.
[03:39.180 --> 03:40.620]  It's the old west out here again.
[03:40.620 --> 03:42.980]  And I'm glad Missouri got over that tornado.
[03:43.300 --> 03:45.460]  Poor sound effect. I think it was Oklahoma, wasn't that?
[03:45.900 --> 03:47.100]  I don't know.
[03:48.620 --> 03:50.740]  We're off to a stellar start.
[03:50.740 --> 03:53.700]  So my buddy, Wade, we're talking about how his level.
[03:54.020 --> 03:55.940]  I'd probably put him in like a blue belt.
[03:55.940 --> 03:58.700]  OK, I don't know where that is in the level of belts.
[03:59.100 --> 04:02.980]  You know, I think he goes, you're not speaking my color right in the middle.
[04:03.140 --> 04:05.060]  You like that color? Yeah. Well, then. Cool.
[04:05.060 --> 04:07.740]  Yeah, I would take myself at a five to a six.
[04:07.780 --> 04:10.340]  What's it white out of a blue, brown, black?
[04:10.780 --> 04:14.500]  I'd say like white, yellow, orange, blue, purple.
[04:14.700 --> 04:16.140]  Oh, I was talking to you, Jitsu.
[04:16.140 --> 04:17.300]  Well, we got four belts.
[04:17.300 --> 04:19.700]  All right. No, wherever I went, they gave us a lot of belts.
[04:20.020 --> 04:22.860]  I'm talking. They sold belts out.
[04:23.540 --> 04:26.140]  Nice. Oh, you get the next one.
[04:26.260 --> 04:29.060]  Oh, man. Didn't you want that one with the stripes on it?
[04:29.100 --> 04:31.500]  Oh, dude, I did have to. Actually, we did get stripes.
[04:31.860 --> 04:34.900]  They put yellow stripes on your white belt so that you think like teasing.
[04:34.900 --> 04:35.980]  They give you like the pretest.
[04:35.980 --> 04:37.140]  Not ready to test.
[04:37.140 --> 04:39.740]  Now, at the test time, you can actually pay the money to take the real test
[04:39.740 --> 04:41.500]  to buy the real suck a dick.
[04:41.500 --> 04:42.460]  What were you doing?
[04:42.460 --> 04:45.980]  Realizing where I went to karate class was kind of I met it.
[04:46.020 --> 04:47.620]  There's the Ponzi scheme.
[04:47.620 --> 04:50.780]  A fucking karate is what it was.
[04:50.820 --> 04:54.020]  You got to bring in two friends before you can get to the yellow belt.
[04:54.060 --> 04:57.500]  But don't worry, we'll pay you out with the black belt at the end. Right.
[04:57.940 --> 04:59.580]  Bring it like eight people in the class.
[04:59.580 --> 05:01.140]  You're rocking a purple belt.
[05:01.140 --> 05:02.660]  Here's my Amway card.
[05:02.660 --> 05:03.860]  You can't fucking asshole.
[05:03.860 --> 05:05.620]  You can't do the splits, dude. Nobody cares.
[05:05.620 --> 05:07.940]  Not at all. Not at all. Here's a purple belt.
[05:07.980 --> 05:10.380]  What's up? I grow culture.
[05:10.380 --> 05:12.300]  Yeah. So we got two comedians in the place.
[05:12.300 --> 05:14.700]  This is getting weird. All fucking ready.
[05:14.700 --> 05:16.260]  Already. We've been taking dabs.
[05:16.260 --> 05:18.580]  Well, Clint has not been to I've got a Clint does not smoke.
[05:18.580 --> 05:19.860]  And I've tried to pass him a pipe.
[05:19.860 --> 05:21.900]  Ways tried to pass him a pipe.
[05:21.900 --> 05:23.140]  Everybody, everybody.
[05:23.140 --> 05:24.540]  You had the guy that was here earlier hanging out.
[05:24.540 --> 05:25.500]  This tried to pass him a pipe.
[05:25.500 --> 05:28.060]  And then when he said, I don't smoke, he looked at him like, why are you here?
[05:28.060 --> 05:29.300]  You got worried?
[05:29.580 --> 05:31.300]  Fucking narc.
[05:31.300 --> 05:34.180]  Well, to his defense, he is slightly retarded.
[05:34.220 --> 05:36.460]  Mike Clint, but the dude that was here.
[05:36.460 --> 05:38.060]  Well, Clint included. Yeah.
[05:38.060 --> 05:39.940]  Yeah. We're going to go tell the people retarded.
[05:40.060 --> 05:41.700]  Oh, I'm slightly.
[05:41.700 --> 05:44.940]  So the facts Clint needed a helmet earlier in life than he got one.
[05:45.260 --> 05:48.020]  Yeah. So I'm going to kind of segue.
[05:48.180 --> 05:49.780]  You guys are both comedians.
[05:49.780 --> 05:51.260]  You perform on stage. Correct.
[05:51.260 --> 05:54.980]  You got you do bits that are prepared and also a little bit of improv.
[05:55.340 --> 05:59.060]  Yep. We were talking earlier about the use of cannabis.
[05:59.060 --> 06:01.420]  Wade, I'm going to bust your balls.
[06:01.420 --> 06:03.420]  You do smoke weed before you perform.
[06:03.420 --> 06:05.220]  And you're pretty cool about people knowing that.
[06:05.220 --> 06:06.860]  I hope because I just said 100 percent. Yeah.
[06:06.940 --> 06:09.260]  So Wade does participate in cannabis use.
[06:09.740 --> 06:13.100]  I say your weed use is more medicinal than recreational.
[06:13.140 --> 06:15.780]  It is 100 percent medicinal. Yeah. Yeah. I know you.
[06:15.820 --> 06:17.380]  It keeps my shit straight, man.
[06:17.380 --> 06:18.340]  You're a high strung dude.
[06:18.340 --> 06:20.900]  I guess and you're high right now and you're still high strung as fuck.
[06:20.900 --> 06:23.340]  And I walked about eight miles a day. Yeah.
[06:23.820 --> 06:25.100]  Yeah. This dude's fired up.
[06:25.100 --> 06:28.500]  And so we're talking about the differences between Clint not smoking
[06:28.500 --> 06:30.540]  because he doesn't drink or smoke at all.
[06:31.580 --> 06:34.460]  Well, no, there's no disrespect to you, big pussy. But I mean,
[06:37.100 --> 06:38.660]  we're just we're just mentioning that.
[06:38.660 --> 06:43.540]  So do you think that smoking before you perform your show helps you out
[06:43.540 --> 06:45.820]  or does it hinder your show?
[06:45.820 --> 06:47.940]  So do you remember when you first smoked?
[06:49.020 --> 06:51.340]  Yeah. Yeah. Do it.
[06:52.100 --> 06:55.380]  It takes tolerance, I guess, to build up to where you could
[06:56.500 --> 07:01.140]  to get past all of the in the beginning, like the paranoia. OK.
[07:01.700 --> 07:06.420]  To get past the the this is actually stoned and feels good.
[07:06.980 --> 07:10.420]  So in the beginning, when I would get too high.
[07:11.420 --> 07:13.820]  I would sit there and lose track and lose thought,
[07:14.260 --> 07:17.260]  or maybe I wasn't in enough concentration and focus,
[07:17.260 --> 07:23.180]  but I would learn with marijuana how to do it essentially. OK.
[07:23.740 --> 07:29.260]  And now now I have a great little medicinal level to where I sit at
[07:29.660 --> 07:31.940]  and that and I don't have to go overboard.
[07:32.380 --> 07:35.500]  I don't have to do anything like brash and overmedicate
[07:35.500 --> 07:37.500]  because that's what you want to tend to do at the beginning.
[07:37.500 --> 07:40.260]  Your anxiety is like jacked. Yeah.
[07:40.460 --> 07:44.100]  You're through the roof and you're like, I need I used to suck a bull.
[07:44.500 --> 07:49.180]  No shit. Right before my set, I would I would leave the comic
[07:49.180 --> 07:52.980]  who would perform for me for five minutes and I would shotgun a bull.
[07:52.980 --> 07:57.060]  So goddamn fast. Go inside. Get up on stage.
[07:57.580 --> 08:01.580]  I would crowd work for the first minute of my set to get over the like
[08:01.580 --> 08:03.780]  the cough and the high, the initial initial.
[08:03.860 --> 08:06.300]  And then I would I would go into my material.
[08:06.300 --> 08:09.340]  And if I remembered it all the way through, I would kill.
[08:10.540 --> 08:12.860]  But then if if I didn't.
[08:13.140 --> 08:15.420]  Yeah. Then it sucked.
[08:16.300 --> 08:20.460]  So how long did it take to find your threshold for more?
[08:20.460 --> 08:22.780]  Because I'm a musician. Yeah, I know that same threshold.
[08:23.300 --> 08:24.940]  I can't keep time if I get too high.
[08:24.940 --> 08:26.900]  And I know that. And you get panicky.
[08:26.900 --> 08:29.460]  Of course, start doing dumb shit on stage to try to cover.
[08:30.060 --> 08:32.740]  How long did it take you to find your little threshold zone
[08:32.740 --> 08:34.540]  to where you knew how high you could be?
[08:34.540 --> 08:37.260]  I'm going to say a good eight months.
[08:37.260 --> 08:40.540]  Like, were you smoking the first time you performed comedy?
[08:40.540 --> 08:41.500]  Were you high?
[08:41.500 --> 08:44.100]  Yeah. Yes. OK. Yeah. Extremely.
[08:44.140 --> 08:47.700]  OK, so you didn't have to learn how to do comedy and be high at separate times.
[08:47.700 --> 08:50.060]  You just you were already high doing it your first time.
[08:50.060 --> 08:55.420]  I have a little bit of a lucky background of of being sort of a public speaker.
[08:55.420 --> 08:58.420]  I was in management for a little while and I also did acting.
[08:59.020 --> 09:04.660]  So the acting thing like I just started smoking weed two years ago,
[09:05.300 --> 09:09.300]  like on the reg, we took Wade to the way it was kind of an amateur
[09:09.300 --> 09:12.820]  until he went to the secret a lot of what he was a huge amateur.
[09:12.820 --> 09:17.300]  I would he would come over and hang out and I would give him dabs a one one day.
[09:17.340 --> 09:19.340]  And it would it would fuck him up for the afternoon.
[09:19.340 --> 09:21.460]  He told me that he took a nap for eight hours and stuff.
[09:21.820 --> 09:26.700]  So we took him to the secret cup and he sat next to me at the secret cup
[09:26.700 --> 09:29.460]  where we were getting down and I looked at him and I told him pretty much
[09:29.620 --> 09:30.860]  you're in the big leagues, buddy.
[09:30.860 --> 09:33.100]  And I started giving him man dabs. Yes.
[09:33.100 --> 09:35.700]  And from then on, I quit giving him the little amateur dabs.
[09:35.700 --> 09:37.860]  I decided he got his purple belt that day. Yeah.
[09:38.060 --> 09:42.220]  And so two years from till now, dude, you really stepped up the game.
[09:42.220 --> 09:45.860]  Well, it's I love marijuana
[09:46.500 --> 09:50.700]  and I feel like I gave it an unfair shot for only 34 years of my life.
[09:50.700 --> 09:53.420]  So I'm giving it all fair shots.
[09:53.420 --> 09:57.060]  I can't and it improves everything that I've done so far,
[09:57.060 --> 10:02.820]  because I know a lot of people say that it makes you go all over the place.
[10:03.500 --> 10:08.900]  But for someone like me that is wired, I'm already all over the place.
[10:08.940 --> 10:12.620]  So what marijuana does for me is focus more than anything.
[10:13.580 --> 10:17.860]  Tell me more about that first 34 years that you said you were biased on marijuana.
[10:17.860 --> 10:19.420]  I fucking hated all of you.
[10:19.420 --> 10:21.860]  All of us potheads. Yes. Why?
[10:21.900 --> 10:27.700]  I would specifically blame it on my on my brother going back to high school.
[10:27.700 --> 10:30.100]  My brother was scouted by like major Division
[10:30.100 --> 10:32.780]  one universities for football when he was in seventh grade,
[10:33.620 --> 10:37.580]  started smoking weed around ninth grade, and he
[10:38.500 --> 10:40.820]  gradually declined to where he quit playing football
[10:42.380 --> 10:44.380]  by his junior, senior year.
[10:44.380 --> 10:47.860]  And I blamed marijuana a lot for this because I watched his life
[10:47.980 --> 10:51.740]  and I watched my life and then I watched a lot of my friends around me.
[10:51.740 --> 10:53.740]  And it's mostly never thing like that.
[10:53.740 --> 10:56.620]  And I was I was very judgmental of all of them.
[10:56.860 --> 11:00.500]  And I found out it wasn't just it wasn't weed.
[11:00.500 --> 11:02.700]  They were just losers. And I was a douchebag.
[11:02.740 --> 11:05.100]  Now it's a personality trait. And that's all it was.
[11:05.300 --> 11:08.780]  It really was. So and that was just us as young kids.
[11:08.780 --> 11:09.980]  And that was me in my 20s.
[11:09.980 --> 11:13.740]  And then and then I went to Vegas and in Las Vegas.
[11:14.300 --> 11:17.180]  I was there for four years to get away from my ex fiance,
[11:17.180 --> 11:21.060]  which I decided to keep around in my life for several years afterwards,
[11:21.580 --> 11:24.180]  which led to me doing
[11:24.180 --> 11:28.420]  about three antipsychotics, a couple of antidepressants
[11:28.420 --> 11:31.020]  and a couple of sleeping medications a day
[11:31.580 --> 11:35.660]  to calm down these major hives that would break out all over my body.
[11:35.700 --> 11:38.060]  All prescribed? All prescribed.
[11:38.780 --> 11:39.900]  Good question. Yeah, absolutely.
[11:39.900 --> 11:41.580]  It was Las Vegas. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.
[11:42.860 --> 11:46.780]  They this this was all given to me to initially
[11:47.540 --> 11:50.540]  get rid of these hives that were breaking out all over my body
[11:50.540 --> 11:53.980]  at random times and in situations that were just from anxiety. Correct.
[11:54.020 --> 11:58.900]  Mostly. OK. But but no one knew dermatologist and no regular doctors.
[11:59.060 --> 12:01.340]  Finally, someone said, go see a shrink.
[12:01.340 --> 12:02.980]  I was like, great, I'm going to go see you shrink.
[12:02.980 --> 12:04.020]  And they're like, you fucked up.
[12:04.020 --> 12:06.140]  I was like, finally, I knew it.
[12:06.860 --> 12:09.100]  So they put me on all this shit
[12:10.500 --> 12:14.340]  and I would find myself at a stoplight and I'm driving my truck.
[12:14.340 --> 12:16.700]  Right. And I've got this smile on my face.
[12:17.620 --> 12:20.140]  But inside my head, I'm like, why?
[12:21.540 --> 12:23.900]  I there's no I'm not.
[12:24.220 --> 12:25.460]  I'm not happy for any reason.
[12:25.460 --> 12:26.860]  Not sad for any reason either.
[12:26.860 --> 12:30.340]  There's just there's no I'm not I'm not this.
[12:30.340 --> 12:31.540]  I'm not this.
[12:31.540 --> 12:35.660]  And then like I would turn on the shower and just forget that it was on
[12:36.260 --> 12:38.860]  and not in a weed way, but just it was on.
[12:40.740 --> 12:43.140]  And then I found myself needing like Klonopin,
[12:43.140 --> 12:46.020]  what was one the specific one that I knew that worked like
[12:46.020 --> 12:49.420]  that could immediately get rid of the hives, boom, gone later.
[12:49.500 --> 12:54.340]  What is what is the Klonopin is an anti-anxiety.
[12:54.460 --> 12:57.700]  OK, and anti-psychotic, I believe, is what they used it for.
[12:57.700 --> 13:02.300]  So like it immediately can calm down some anxiety, man.
[13:02.300 --> 13:05.420]  And it it worked for me.
[13:05.420 --> 13:11.140]  But it didn't work for me, you know, so I moved from Vegas, went to New Orleans.
[13:11.580 --> 13:15.260]  When I got to New Orleans, I no longer had the insurance,
[13:15.700 --> 13:19.700]  but no longer the will to actually like take these pills.
[13:19.860 --> 13:22.460]  I hate being slaves to things in my life.
[13:23.300 --> 13:24.580]  So I quit.
[13:25.700 --> 13:30.660]  And a year or so went by and I knew that I still needed something.
[13:32.380 --> 13:37.180]  So I finally decided being in New Orleans, marijuana is prevalent down there,
[13:37.180 --> 13:39.940]  although it is very expensive because it can be rare.
[13:39.980 --> 13:41.620]  No, you can't really grow it down there.
[13:41.620 --> 13:43.660]  They'll fuck your shit up, dude. Bad.
[13:46.020 --> 13:49.300]  I said, I'm going to try a weed and I'm going to I'm going to give it
[13:50.180 --> 13:53.100]  a control point, you know, I'm going to try it this many times.
[13:53.460 --> 13:56.060]  And if I hate it, I'm going to get past it.
[13:56.180 --> 13:57.700]  That's called the old college try.
[13:57.700 --> 14:00.020]  Well, and I just wanted to be educated about it.
[14:00.140 --> 14:02.060]  You know, I was like, I don't want to be stupid.
[14:02.060 --> 14:05.420]  I'm 30 at the time. I'm 34.
[14:06.420 --> 14:08.220]  And I'm going to be smart about this.
[14:09.980 --> 14:13.620]  It took three, two and a half tries,
[14:13.620 --> 14:17.820]  and I was like, I don't need I don't need any more to know that this is good for me.
[14:18.940 --> 14:20.580]  And and I haven't stopped.
[14:20.580 --> 14:25.060]  Good for you. How good for me in the no anxiety,
[14:25.380 --> 14:28.740]  like the anxiety that I have now is justified,
[14:28.740 --> 14:32.620]  like I'm about ready to go on stage in front of like maybe a hundred people
[14:32.620 --> 14:36.540]  with words that like I don't know if they're going to work.
[14:37.460 --> 14:38.780]  It could be funny. Maybe not.
[14:38.780 --> 14:41.100]  I know even even the tested stuff.
[14:41.140 --> 14:42.460]  I don't know if it's going to work.
[14:42.580 --> 14:44.820]  Not every time in a different town,
[14:45.420 --> 14:49.380]  in a different town that doesn't know references that maybe I've grown up with.
[14:49.380 --> 14:50.780]  Well, not even not even that.
[14:50.780 --> 14:56.980]  Just, you know, it and that's why like the public scene so different is because we
[14:56.980 --> 14:58.500]  we only have a couple of spots.
[14:58.900 --> 15:01.060]  So it's always it's kind of always the same audience.
[15:01.100 --> 15:03.220]  Yeah. So you want to write new stuff.
[15:03.380 --> 15:06.660]  Yeah. But but when you're moving out and the stuff that does work down here,
[15:06.660 --> 15:08.540]  you're thinking, oh, good, I get to go use it up there.
[15:08.540 --> 15:10.540]  They've never heard the stuff. Yeah, 100 percent.
[15:10.540 --> 15:13.820]  And I and I completely but it's never 100 percent.
[15:14.060 --> 15:16.220]  You might be taking a knife to a gunfight up there.
[15:16.260 --> 15:17.580]  Yeah, buddy, you could be.
[15:17.940 --> 15:22.460]  Well, I mean, you just even on a good room, you know, but but I can understand your
[15:22.460 --> 15:23.780]  anxiety or stuff like.
[15:23.780 --> 15:25.980]  Well, here's how it helps. That's justified anxiety.
[15:26.020 --> 15:29.620]  Yeah. And here's how it helps me now throughout the day and outside of county.
[15:30.500 --> 15:32.700]  I wake up at 5 a.m. every morning.
[15:33.500 --> 15:36.740]  I go to bed around 11 to midnight.
[15:37.820 --> 15:39.580]  I don't have children. I'm single.
[15:40.220 --> 15:41.700]  I sleep for like five.
[15:42.340 --> 15:44.740]  I have you. Excuse me, guys.
[15:45.420 --> 15:46.660]  I have like five.
[15:47.020 --> 15:49.580]  Nice excuse. I get like five hours of sleep.
[15:49.580 --> 15:54.220]  And it's because like the corporate world teaches you how to be this machine.
[15:54.780 --> 15:56.740]  It's perfect. You were in the military also.
[15:56.740 --> 15:59.260]  Correct. So the two of them have got you kind of robot mode.
[15:59.260 --> 16:02.740]  But but they don't teach you how to not be a machine.
[16:03.100 --> 16:06.820]  So they don't teach you how to shut it off because they want you thinking about work
[16:06.820 --> 16:08.900]  all the time. And I would be and I still do now.
[16:08.900 --> 16:12.860]  So like I consume myself with all these.
[16:13.460 --> 16:16.860]  Not only my comedy, but all my fucked up thoughts like everybody else has.
[16:17.500 --> 16:19.100]  And they keep me awake.
[16:19.100 --> 16:20.580]  And I wake up at 5 a.m.
[16:20.580 --> 16:23.260]  And if I don't smoke weed, like.
[16:24.260 --> 16:26.740]  I immediately wake up and walk five miles.
[16:26.980 --> 16:29.420]  And that's no lie. And I'm heavily sedated.
[16:29.460 --> 16:33.020]  So would you be an advocate that cannabis does help PTSD?
[16:33.380 --> 16:36.900]  One hundred percent displaying signs of PTSD in front of the two of us right now?
[16:36.900 --> 16:37.980]  Yeah. One hundred percent.
[16:37.980 --> 16:42.860]  OK. Yeah. So there are states that are not allowing that as a reason, a valid reason
[16:42.860 --> 16:46.460]  for medical marijuana. So anybody that's listening, you just heard Wade mostly
[16:46.460 --> 16:48.100]  described PTSD and depression.
[16:48.500 --> 16:52.020]  Depression. One hundred percent is what his cannabis uses is helping.
[16:52.540 --> 16:55.860]  Do you I know you're new and you're you hang out with me and a couple other guys
[16:55.860 --> 16:59.260]  that are kind of we know what's going on. Do you have a strain that works best for
[16:59.260 --> 17:01.100]  you or a strain that doesn't work for you?
[17:03.340 --> 17:04.860]  And I know you're not as well versed.
[17:04.860 --> 17:06.780]  Yeah, no, no. That's why we've got Clinton, you here.
[17:06.940 --> 17:09.780]  You guys are going to help me with the newer folks that are listening.
[17:09.780 --> 17:11.420]  I think you're the best.
[17:11.420 --> 17:15.380]  The last best thing that I've tried out of from from the samples that I've tried,
[17:15.700 --> 17:19.940]  the veganic lemon Jeffrey, no lie, broke some shit off.
[17:19.980 --> 17:21.300]  Nice. Like that's some shit.
[17:21.580 --> 17:23.740]  It really is. That's mostly sativa.
[17:23.780 --> 17:25.100]  It's almost a pure sativa.
[17:25.180 --> 17:27.860]  So that's dab wise.
[17:28.140 --> 17:32.060]  You're not beating your grateful dog or your Girl Scout cookies hands down.
[17:32.100 --> 17:34.900]  OK. And weed wise that GSC.
[17:35.900 --> 17:37.260]  Show me something.
[17:37.260 --> 17:39.180]  Show me something that's going up against that shit.
[17:39.180 --> 17:40.940]  That Girl Scout cookies is a hell of a strain.
[17:40.940 --> 17:42.100]  I wish I would have read that.
[17:42.100 --> 17:43.700]  I did not share that shit, dude.
[17:43.700 --> 17:46.140]  So I wanted to talk a little bit more.
[17:46.940 --> 17:48.740]  I'm going to whisper something to you because I want to know if I have
[17:48.740 --> 17:50.100]  permission to talk about something.
[17:50.100 --> 17:51.820]  Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
[17:51.900 --> 17:56.220]  OK, I want to talk about some lab testing right quick, as you said, that lemon
[17:56.220 --> 18:01.740]  Jeffrey, I did some samples to steep Hill Halen labs in Denver and the lemon
[18:01.740 --> 18:04.100]  Jeffrey was grown veganically.
[18:04.100 --> 18:05.620]  It was bred by me, grown by me.
[18:06.020 --> 18:09.260]  We hit twenty four point three four percent THC.
[18:09.260 --> 18:14.380]  A total cannabinoid content on that was twenty six point.
[18:14.500 --> 18:15.620]  Let me make sure I'm not lying.
[18:16.340 --> 18:17.540]  It's twenty five point three.
[18:17.540 --> 18:18.980]  Sorry, it's really small print on my phone.
[18:19.300 --> 18:22.220]  Twenty five point three percent cannabinoids on the lemon Jeffrey.
[18:23.260 --> 18:26.180]  Searching my phone, I'm looking for the grateful dog.
[18:26.180 --> 18:27.380]  We've got several tests in here.
[18:27.380 --> 18:28.340]  Here's the grateful dog.
[18:28.340 --> 18:29.300]  Twenty four point eight.
[18:29.300 --> 18:30.900]  I think it was something similar to that.
[18:30.940 --> 18:31.980]  Yeah, really close.
[18:32.700 --> 18:37.900]  Twenty three point three to THC a and then for a total of twenty four point
[18:37.900 --> 18:39.340]  three, yeah, that's the grateful dog.
[18:39.340 --> 18:41.980]  So the strains were breeding that you guys are getting to smoke around here.
[18:41.980 --> 18:42.740]  You're getting spoiled.
[18:42.740 --> 18:44.540]  They do. All right.
[18:44.660 --> 18:46.740]  So for us amateurs, gotcha.
[18:46.780 --> 18:48.460]  Let's go over a couple of basics here.
[18:48.460 --> 18:49.540]  I like it. No.
[18:49.540 --> 18:55.340]  Yeah, because I'm going to ask when you say THC, I know I know a lot of us know
[18:55.340 --> 19:00.540]  what THC is, but just to start out with some guys maybe from wherever that don't
[19:00.540 --> 19:03.740]  know THC being the thing that gets you high, correct?
[19:03.980 --> 19:06.700]  Yes, there are several active cannabinoids.
[19:06.700 --> 19:10.060]  I'm actually trying to get to the Steep Hill website while I'm doing this so that
[19:10.060 --> 19:14.300]  we can maybe they have a chart of cannabinoids on there to give me a little
[19:14.300 --> 19:16.620]  bit of a guide. OK, that'd be really cool to see.
[19:16.700 --> 19:19.740]  Yeah. And then and then cannabinoids was my other question was.
[19:20.220 --> 19:23.820]  So the cannabinoids are the part that they work in conjunction with terpenoids,
[19:23.820 --> 19:26.940]  flavonoids and a few other molecules, but it's mostly cannabinoids that we're
[19:26.940 --> 19:28.700]  looking for. And these are molecules.
[19:29.020 --> 19:30.460]  Uh, yes.
[19:30.460 --> 19:35.100]  OK, essentially. And so they call them compounds is what I think they actually
[19:35.100 --> 19:38.540]  call them. OK, I'm not a scientist, but I stay more in the grow room.
[19:38.540 --> 19:40.300]  But when I play one on TV, that's right.
[19:40.300 --> 19:43.980]  I stayed at a holiday. So I paid I paid these guys to do the test
[19:43.980 --> 19:47.580]  because they are they did a hotel, a hotel for 20.
[19:48.060 --> 19:56.860]  I like it. So they said it's for they test for CBG, a CBG, THC, THC, a THC, V,
[19:57.180 --> 20:09.020]  THC by itself, DATHC, THC, V, CBN, a CBN, CBD, a CBD, CBC, CBC.
[20:09.020 --> 20:10.140]  Oh, there's a negative sign.
[20:11.180 --> 20:12.780]  And I don't know what that negative sign means.
[20:12.780 --> 20:17.580]  But for the most part that we're looking for, honestly, was the THC, the THC, a
[20:18.940 --> 20:21.660]  those are all cannabinoids and the the CBD.
[20:21.660 --> 20:23.100]  Yeah, those are the basic cannabinoids.
[20:23.100 --> 20:28.860]  The THC is the one that gives you the head high that makes you kind of it's
[20:28.860 --> 20:34.860]  like more psychedelic. The CBD is the one that's more body oriented, more analgesic,
[20:34.860 --> 20:39.660]  more relaxing. And the CBD is what's helping with the the opposite is the one that's
[20:39.660 --> 20:45.900]  all correct. The THC. Oh, really? Because it makes him I think it lifts your brain up
[20:45.900 --> 20:49.340]  out of the depression. It makes it's uplifting. It spins you up out of it.
[20:49.900 --> 20:54.540]  The CBD, however, is the one that they're giving to kids for seizures and epilepsy
[20:54.540 --> 21:00.540]  problems and autism and tumors and such. And that is getting rid or stopping cancer.
[21:00.540 --> 21:05.420]  And a lot of people is CBD, CBD rich medicine. So I'm going to brag here. I've got a
[21:05.420 --> 21:10.060]  cut that was given to me from my friend Joey at Natural Mystic Cannabis Caregivers. He
[21:10.060 --> 21:16.940]  got it from our good friends at DNA Genetics. I grew this Tora Bora. It came in the THC,
[21:16.940 --> 21:21.980]  not impressive. Four point nine seven. But the CBD content on this bad dog was eight
[21:21.980 --> 21:27.660]  point five six percent. It's a two to one CBD to THC ratio, which means this is perfect
[21:27.660 --> 21:31.580]  for those sick folks that don't want to get high. One hundred percent needs some medicine.
[21:31.580 --> 21:35.980]  OK, this is the one we've got a patient, a friend of mine, good brother who's going
[21:35.980 --> 21:39.900]  through some turmoil right now with his health. But he came over and we've talked about it.
[21:39.900 --> 21:44.860]  He didn't feel good. He was on a cane. He felt like shit mentally, physically and spiritually.
[21:44.940 --> 21:49.260]  He had some dabs of that Tora Bora and stood up and forgot his cane and got all the way up the
[21:49.260 --> 21:54.220]  stairs and turned around and shouted, will you bring me my cane? Yeah, that's the power of CBD
[21:54.220 --> 21:59.260]  medicine. One hundred percent. I got to visualize myself. One hundred percent. Yeah. When so. So
[21:59.260 --> 22:06.700]  it sounds like twenty five is huge as a THC content. That's that's a good good reference
[22:06.700 --> 22:13.580]  point to ask for a high anything over. The guy told me anything over 13 percent is considered
[22:13.580 --> 22:19.580]  high. Whoa. But the growers and breeders and dispensary guys, we look for anything 18 to 21
[22:19.580 --> 22:25.340]  is satisfactory. Some of the highest there's reports of twenty nines and thirties, but that's
[22:25.340 --> 22:30.460]  questionable. Twenty six and twenty seven are remarkable. My good buddy Spencer, I'm going to
[22:30.460 --> 22:35.900]  give Spencer a shout out. What's up, Spence? What is up, Spencer? Yes, Spencer. He was here last
[22:35.900 --> 22:40.700]  time. Spencer's the shit. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Spence is a cool bro. He grew a stream that I bred.
[22:41.340 --> 22:45.660]  So funny. I know. I know. Like two black guys knocked on my door and he goes, black people here
[22:45.660 --> 22:49.420]  are black people here. I think is what he said. Black folk are black people here. He's so cool.
[22:49.420 --> 22:54.860]  The Capelton hit twenty nine or twenty point five nine. The one that's impressive. I'm looking for
[22:54.860 --> 23:02.220]  it. Spence grew Rian's rhino from another breeder and that hit twenty five point nine percent THC.
[23:02.860 --> 23:08.860]  The total was twenty seven point two with three point one percent terpenoids in it. And I didn't
[23:08.860 --> 23:12.940]  even pay him to test for the terpenoids. They were just so blown away that they wanted to do it.
[23:12.940 --> 23:18.860]  No shit. So if somebody had one, would we direct them to that website or something if they wanted
[23:18.860 --> 23:22.620]  to get their stuff tested since they're being pretty cool about testing your stuff? You know,
[23:22.620 --> 23:28.380]  I'm affiliated with labs and things or with dispensaries and things, and they just kind of
[23:28.380 --> 23:33.340]  changed the rules like two days ago to where now you have to be a licensed facility to get anything
[23:33.420 --> 23:38.460]  through the testing facilities. The fuck? Yeah. Fuck you. We'll talk about that on the over
[23:38.460 --> 23:43.820]  regulation is costing legalization. Welcome to America, man. So I want to give Spence a shout
[23:43.820 --> 23:48.060]  out one more time. Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt that. No, no. Do this. The weed show interrupt
[23:48.060 --> 23:55.260]  all day. Girl Scout cookies grown by Spence at the Garden of Weeden. Twenty six point eight
[23:55.260 --> 24:02.460]  nine percent THC. You fucking you goddamn stoners. Total. Total cannabinoid content, dude.
[24:02.460 --> 24:07.580]  Twenty nine point two. Get the fuck on. Nine point two from Spence in the Garden of Weeden.
[24:08.140 --> 24:13.100]  Follow that dude at that Garden of Weeden. I think there might be a but I'm pretty sure it's at
[24:13.100 --> 24:16.620]  Garden of Weeden on Instagram. Yeah, that's impressive. I'm going to go to high times
[24:16.620 --> 24:22.780]  real quick and look at their high times. Strongest strains, because I don't want to misquote myself
[24:23.420 --> 24:28.140]  and say what I think the OG ghost train Hayes came in at. If I could spell strongest,
[24:28.140 --> 24:32.700]  it'd be helpful. Yes, he's sorry. I'm talking and fucking typing here and I'm just saying I
[24:32.700 --> 24:41.020]  said what I was typing. I do that. The Garden of Weeden. Yeah, dude. And honestly, no disdispense.
[24:41.020 --> 24:46.940]  He's not the first person I've heard use that. Oh, no, no. I'm just saying the originality of
[24:47.900 --> 24:54.460]  marijuana names for things never ceases to amaze me. Just the names that you guys choose to take
[24:54.460 --> 25:01.660]  in like form into the weed culture is amazing. There's probably something for like garbage truck
[25:01.660 --> 25:07.820]  that is just like, oh, we can name everything something cooler than it is. Yeah. In 2013,
[25:07.820 --> 25:11.500]  this highest strain listed that I find on this little thing on high times is twenty four point
[25:11.500 --> 25:16.380]  seven nine. I'm going to do another Google search because I am confident there needs to be something
[25:16.380 --> 25:20.300]  higher because I don't want to go shit in our pants that we did higher than those. All right.
[25:20.380 --> 25:25.500]  I'm not seeing Garden of Weeden on Instagram, so it might be. Oh, this will be a video. There
[25:25.500 --> 25:32.380]  will be sound. I need to mute the Garden of Weeden. And it's a WEDN. Sorry, I should have.
[25:32.380 --> 25:38.380]  I just thought that that might matter. I just realized that WEDN. No, he just and we'd and.
[25:39.260 --> 25:44.780]  Yeah. See? See, here we go. Oh, are we following people on Instagram? I'm just for us. So God,
[25:44.860 --> 25:49.580]  when I said that, I actually meant the listeners. But hey, man, you. Hey, Bruce Banner,
[25:49.580 --> 25:53.980]  number three, twenty eight point three five percent was their winner for one of these years.
[25:53.980 --> 25:59.580]  So Bruce Banner, some good. Yeah. And I are keeping up with those guys. Yeah. Yeah. We're
[25:59.580 --> 26:05.420]  keeping up. That's pretty impressive. Yeah. Garden of Weeden. And yeah, I got it now. Good, good.
[26:05.420 --> 26:10.700]  Clint's following him. Cool. Cool. So I want to get back to Wade for one second. I asked for
[26:10.700 --> 26:17.020]  permission. Can I mention your dad, dude? Yeah, 100 percent. Wade's dad is an elderly gentleman.
[26:17.020 --> 26:21.340]  I've honestly never met him, but I've been heavily involved with 78. He's 78 years old. I've been
[26:21.340 --> 26:28.700]  kind of helping these guys figure out and guide his short stint with medical marijuana use.
[26:29.500 --> 26:33.660]  I heard that the old guy was having problems and I kind of jokingly said, give him some pot
[26:33.660 --> 26:39.100]  cookies or something. And Wade was like, no, I want to. But my mom disagrees with it. So after
[26:39.100 --> 26:45.260]  some persuasion, I took me about three months, three months of persuasion on mom research and
[26:45.260 --> 26:49.980]  then tell him what actually I think will actually sent them over the convincing edge to let him do
[26:49.980 --> 26:57.100]  it. And I'm referring to the Facebook article that I did or remember I was a brave. I asked.
[26:57.100 --> 27:01.740]  Well, I made them. Oh, yeah. No, no, no, no. Yeah, I remember. Yeah. OK. So.
[27:04.380 --> 27:08.860]  Basically, attacking my dad or not attacking, but the plan of attack for my dad was having as much
[27:08.860 --> 27:15.180]  information as I could and having as much information I could is hard for someone who
[27:15.180 --> 27:20.620]  a is not familiar, I guess you could say with the type of contacts to get such information.
[27:20.620 --> 27:24.060]  I mean, you could look it all up and everything like that. But when it comes down to it, there's
[27:24.060 --> 27:27.580]  a lot of people that are going to be coming in from out of the state that will look at the products
[27:27.580 --> 27:34.380]  and be like, I'd love it, but I really don't know what I'm getting. So I didn't want that to happen.
[27:35.340 --> 27:38.780]  I didn't want to not have that information and I wasn't sure what was going down.
[27:39.340 --> 27:43.820]  Jeff took it upon himself. He got a hold of Cheeba Choo's himself on Facebook.
[27:43.820 --> 27:49.660]  And he's like, yo, this is a scenario. This is what hurts. Where can I get this or what is the
[27:49.660 --> 27:54.220]  best method of use? Cheeba Choo's is like you can't get that where you're at, but this is what
[27:54.220 --> 28:00.300]  you can get. And they answered in less than an hour. One hundred percent. And they're about to
[28:01.260 --> 28:06.540]  get 100 percent. And they're a huge company. And for them to just got at me within an hour like
[28:06.540 --> 28:11.020]  that was pretty cool. So when I took all of this information to my dad, I was like, listen, dad,
[28:12.780 --> 28:18.380]  you my dad, my dad has a 12 pound hernia that sits in his front. It looks like a volleyball
[28:18.380 --> 28:22.780]  just always sticking out. He has to hunch over. He worked at the steel mill for 50 years
[28:23.740 --> 28:31.420]  and he can hardly walk. He can hardly sit and he has to take painkillers and it fucks him up bad.
[28:31.420 --> 28:36.860]  It messes him up emotionally, you know, it messes your body up. And I was like, dad, listen,
[28:37.420 --> 28:41.980]  these pills are given to you by by a doctor that really doesn't give a shit about you.
[28:41.980 --> 28:47.340]  And he's given them to you because the people that are telling him to give them to you make
[28:47.340 --> 28:53.980]  money off of your Medicaid. I'm asking you to take the Chibuchu because I love you and I don't
[28:53.980 --> 29:02.860]  want your pain to to to affect your daily life anymore. And he took a man. He took him for about
[29:02.860 --> 29:08.940]  two and a half to three months. He was doing edibles strong. And then I think my mom got involved.
[29:10.860 --> 29:15.100]  Yeah, he was showing signs of having too much fun at Walmart as one of the conversations.
[29:15.580 --> 29:21.020]  One hundred percent. One hundred percent. So you know what, though? If somebody's having fun at
[29:21.020 --> 29:27.180]  Walmart, there's something wrong. Well, I'm just well, no, I agree. Right now, my mom was like
[29:28.140 --> 29:36.780]  my mom wasn't used to the adjustment period of getting high. So my dad is is learning how to get
[29:36.780 --> 29:45.740]  high. And he's 78 years old. And these receptors have never been used. So he's taken an edible
[29:47.020 --> 29:53.180]  and he's high and he was like, I don't think I'm high. Could you pass me some water? You know,
[29:53.180 --> 29:57.900]  and you're like, you're fucking high. Well, at least it's water and not more. Yeah, right. Because
[29:57.900 --> 30:02.620]  as we discussed on the last part, no, no, no, no, this is this is don't take too much. It did happen.
[30:02.620 --> 30:07.020]  This is what did happen. So he was like, he's like, I want to feel like the pills make me feel
[30:07.020 --> 30:12.060]  I was like, well, fucking let's go. You know, I was like, you could just bite off as much as that
[30:12.060 --> 30:16.060]  shit as you want. Dad, it's not going to kill you. Yeah, you may freak out a little. And that's what
[30:16.060 --> 30:21.100]  I said. I was like, be careful. You know, it's like if you like it, go for it. If you don't,
[30:21.100 --> 30:25.980]  then take a nap, bro, because that's probably what you want to do anyway. You're old. We went
[30:25.980 --> 30:32.380]  from getting him the pure CBD. Well, I was Wade kind of tasked me for being in charge. Well,
[30:33.340 --> 30:37.340]  I told you I knew that was my job. You know, in this circle, that's my job. You're old man,
[30:37.340 --> 30:41.500]  sick. You're thinking about weed. Come to me. I'll talk to you about it as a caregiver. Yeah,
[30:41.500 --> 30:47.180]  you're a good guy. And so I went to I obtained the proper CBD dosage I thought he would want.
[30:47.180 --> 30:50.780]  And the old guy's like, I want to get fucked up a little bit. I'm old. I'm missing that headspin
[30:50.780 --> 30:56.060]  from the pills. Exactly. So I got a little bit of THC and he's like, bring it. He kept any it up,
[30:56.060 --> 31:01.260]  bro. He's like more THC. And then tell finally mama cut him off. Apparently. Well, it's because
[31:01.260 --> 31:06.860]  she doesn't know. She was the only one not in the party, basically. Yeah, because my dad would walk,
[31:07.820 --> 31:12.380]  you know, and he just kind of stand there and he's just kind of chilling. And he's just not really,
[31:12.940 --> 31:17.100]  you know, he's not being a crab ass. So my mom thinks something's wrong.
[31:18.460 --> 31:22.220]  And you're just kind of like, No, my mom, he's fucking high. He's just high.
[31:22.860 --> 31:27.340]  Quit fucking staring at that box of macaroni and cheese like it's heaven because man,
[31:27.820 --> 31:32.140]  look into that. You know, it is what it is. And so did it help him? Did it help him?
[31:32.860 --> 31:38.300]  You know, not only did it help, uh, cause he was able, he didn't, my, my father has to take a nap
[31:38.300 --> 31:43.500]  every day. Has to, he, it's gotta be about a three hour to four, four hour nap every day.
[31:44.060 --> 31:51.500]  So he can get through the whole day when he was on the edibles. Didn't have to take a nap. He was
[31:51.580 --> 31:59.820]  active. His mood was better. Uh, he, he was acting like he was like a human, not to say that he's
[31:59.820 --> 32:05.500]  subhuman without me. Uh, did the time you guys spent while you were high together improve? Oh,
[32:05.500 --> 32:10.780]  excuse me. I'm burping. Improve your relationship at all. Wait a minute. Uh, I'm sorry, TMZ. I
[32:10.780 --> 32:13.500]  didn't know that. No, I'm just kidding. No, no, no. That's just kidding. I don't mean to
[32:13.500 --> 32:18.460]  impress. I'm more into the cannabis. Yeah, no, no, no. 100% of cannabis. If that's too much,
[32:19.100 --> 32:25.180]  I can tell you. No, no, no, no, no. I can tell you this much. 100%. I have about zero conversations,
[32:25.180 --> 32:29.580]  serious conversations with my father, especially about a, his health. I've never really given it.
[32:29.580 --> 32:33.580]  This cannabis topic is mostly all I've heard about your father. You talk about it. Yeah,
[32:33.580 --> 32:40.860]  it is. I agree. Yeah. I don't, uh, it's not, it's not a subject that, uh, I approach. He is the,
[32:40.860 --> 32:45.980]  let's just say there's a reason why comics are comics. He's got a lot to do with it. Okay.
[32:46.140 --> 32:50.700]  Uh, so when he's high, did he quit? You said he wasn't a crab. Yeah, no, he wasn't a crab.
[32:51.580 --> 32:57.260]  So you could tell the dude, you could tell how pills affect the attitude. Yeah. Right. So when
[32:57.260 --> 33:03.100]  you take Oxycontin all day long and your brain is just tired of it, those receptors in your brain,
[33:03.100 --> 33:07.980]  when you wake up the next morning, they're burnt, but, but your body wants it still. And you hurt.
[33:07.980 --> 33:13.820]  So you got to take another. Well, not only do you hurt, but your addiction hurts too.
[33:13.900 --> 33:19.260]  So your receptors are like, I need this, but then I need more of it, but you're draining the
[33:19.260 --> 33:25.500]  melatonin in your body the entire time. And this like, and at that time that affects your, your
[33:25.500 --> 33:31.580]  entire attitude, man. And you could see it. You could see it in old people. They're fucking
[33:31.580 --> 33:36.380]  mean all the time. Cause they're up on Oxycontin. So let's try to find a happy medium between a
[33:36.380 --> 33:42.220]  couple of pills and half a Chibichew for him or something to where mama thinks he's still feels,
[33:42.220 --> 33:46.540]  here's what was going down. He would go to Walmart and when he would take the pills,
[33:46.540 --> 33:52.700]  you know, he's zipping around, but he doesn't know he's hurt when he's on the pills.
[33:54.060 --> 34:00.940]  When you take the weed, he's on the weed, but he's aware of his pain. You know what I'm saying?
[34:00.940 --> 34:06.540]  Yeah. So when he's aware of his pain, he's acting in a different way. And my mother did not,
[34:06.540 --> 34:12.700]  does not know how to handle that. The transition for her, for someone that is a non-smoker to see
[34:12.700 --> 34:20.060]  someone of 40 years, her husband that is now trying to be introduced into this culture that
[34:20.060 --> 34:26.140]  she had to be conned into. Oh yeah. They grew up in the time where marijuana was the devil.
[34:26.140 --> 34:31.500]  She admits that freely. She's like, listen, I don't like it because reefer madness. Exactly.
[34:31.980 --> 34:36.540]  Yeah. That's programmed into her head, dude. And she's, she hates it because her best friend's a
[34:36.540 --> 34:42.140]  hippie and she was like, fuck. Yeah. Give him that shit. Shout out. Hippie friend. Right? Hey,
[34:42.140 --> 34:46.460]  Hey. All right. So I said I was going to find a cannabinoid chart, found this little cool,
[34:46.460 --> 34:50.540]  a pie chart. If you've got an Apple computer, it looks like that fucking thing that spins around
[34:50.540 --> 34:56.140]  every time you use iTunes. That's a pie chart kids. They graduate from East high school. You
[34:56.140 --> 35:03.180]  don't know, but, uh, we know. So CBD takes over more than half of the pizza pie here.
[35:03.900 --> 35:10.060]  And the, uh, symptoms that CBD can benefit. I can't even pronounce some of them. So anti-psychotic,
[35:10.060 --> 35:19.020]  anti-epileptic, neuroprotective, anti-spasm, spasmodic, anti-isemic, uh, anti-cancer,
[35:19.980 --> 35:29.260]  anti-emetic, antibacterial, anti-diabetic, uh, anti or anti sporadic analgesic, bone stimulant,
[35:29.260 --> 35:37.580]  anti-inflammatory T cell increase. Ooh, that's huge. Immunosuppressive, uh, adenosine uptake.
[35:38.220 --> 35:42.540]  And there are other words that I honestly, I'm not even going to say good job on the adenosine.
[35:42.780 --> 35:50.860]  Only, only CBD, uh, CBD V, uh, specifically points to bone stimulant, uh, Delta nine THC,
[35:50.860 --> 36:00.700]  a anti proliferative anti spasmodic. There's one that unfortunately the text is the same color as
[36:00.700 --> 36:04.780]  the piece of the pie chart. So I will never know what, which article, which article or
[36:04.780 --> 36:10.540]  a molecule that is. I think if I highlight it with my mice, yeah, maybe, uh, nope, it's not
[36:10.620 --> 36:14.620]  that type of a page. Okay. Nice try though. Now I got to fucking figure out how to zoom out
[36:16.140 --> 36:22.140]  right here. It's got the minus. All right. CBG. Uh, I've never known what CBG was, uh,
[36:22.140 --> 36:29.020]  anti-microbial bone stimulant, analgesic and anti-inflammatory. So I'm thinking anti-microbial.
[36:29.020 --> 36:33.580]  If you've got some mold infection in your lungs, start smoking some CBG heavy medicine.
[36:33.580 --> 36:38.620]  The anti-inflammatory is if you turn that, if the, if you believe in the analgesic, like they said,
[36:38.620 --> 36:43.980]  like you could run on that, but you can rub, like if you believe in the rubs, I guess, do you
[36:43.980 --> 36:50.700]  believe in the rubs? Uh, that's not what I'm aiming for. I'm a pothead and a dabber. I believe that if
[36:50.700 --> 36:56.300]  you believe they work, they do. Okay. Uh, I'm not going to tell anybody that it doesn't. Yeah. Yeah.
[36:56.300 --> 37:00.300]  I'm not sure. I'm not, I don't know. I don't get anything from it because I smoke too much.
[37:01.180 --> 37:06.540]  So it doesn't, I feel nothing from it. Huh. Uh, CBG is a bone stimulant, antibacterial,
[37:06.540 --> 37:13.500]  anti-proliferative. Okay. Uh, and then there's a line coming off of Delta 9 THCV and CBG that I
[37:13.500 --> 37:20.860]  think is anti-epileptic. That is both of them. Uh, bone stimulant for the Delta 9 THCV, anorectic.
[37:21.900 --> 37:26.780]  What does that? That's when you can't get an erection. I hope that's not what that is.
[37:27.820 --> 37:33.260]  And you're right. I'm not sure. Those are just a few from one little pie chart
[37:33.580 --> 37:38.300]  from the different cannabinoids of what they benefit and how they can help you out. And this
[37:38.300 --> 37:44.140]  came from trends in pharmaceutical pharma. It's really tall, small print, pharmacological sciences.
[37:44.140 --> 37:47.340]  There's more printed that I can't even read, but that's where this little chart comes from. Can we
[37:47.340 --> 37:51.580]  tweet that out on the iGrow culture? Maybe a link to that. I've got a better one in my phone that
[37:51.580 --> 37:55.420]  I'll tweet, but I didn't want to dig for that one in my phone. It looks really shitty to be on the
[37:55.420 --> 37:59.980]  phone while I'm, it encourages you assholes to get on the phone. That's mainly what happens. I'm not
[38:00.540 --> 38:04.860]  I'm trying to get more people to your Twitter. Nice. Come Twitter. My Twitter page at iGrow
[38:04.860 --> 38:10.460]  culture. Thanks for following me. Yeah. Thanks for listening, dude. That was, that was really
[38:10.460 --> 38:17.340]  awesome from Wade. Uh, sorry to pry too much. I don't mind, man. That's cool. So, uh, no,
[38:17.340 --> 38:21.100]  go ahead. You had something good to say. Oh no, I don't know that I have anything good to say. I was
[38:21.100 --> 38:26.300]  going to say I go up, um, without that anxiety. And I know that if I did have that, I wouldn't
[38:26.300 --> 38:32.620]  be doing it. So I'm glad that that's working for you. Yeah, dude. Are you nice and calm before
[38:32.620 --> 38:37.180]  you perform? Um, I get really nervous up until I hit the stage. Okay. And then once I'm there,
[38:37.180 --> 38:41.740]  it's just, yeah, I'm already here. You're already up in front of people. It doesn't matter. And I
[38:41.740 --> 38:46.700]  have a background in acting as well. I'm not good acting a little bit of theater. Keep your clothes
[38:46.700 --> 38:53.020]  on. Okay. No, no, I can't seem to do that. Um, no, but I have, uh, like just short films and then a
[38:53.020 --> 38:59.100]  little bit of stage time on theater stuff and, you know, uh, being a front man for a metal band.
[38:59.100 --> 39:04.060]  So I never had a problem getting up in front of people. The hardest part is getting started. Like
[39:04.060 --> 39:08.460]  almost anything in life. Yeah. Saying that first joke in front of somebody has got to be
[39:09.500 --> 39:15.020]  avalanche. We had a friend, we had a friend do it last night, man, that, that, uh, he was pacing. I
[39:15.020 --> 39:18.460]  think he listens to this show. Yes, he does. Give him a shout out. He will. Uh, his name.
[39:19.180 --> 39:24.140]  And he went for his very first time last night and, uh, watching him do it. He did not want to
[39:24.140 --> 39:30.780]  smoke weed before and he didn't drink before. That's good. Immediately after he finished,
[39:31.660 --> 39:38.860]  he was like, give me that motherfucking J and he did man. And he crushed. All right. No, he did
[39:38.860 --> 39:46.940]  great. He did absolutely great. But it is something where I, if I was having those symptoms, that would
[39:46.940 --> 39:51.820]  be something that I'm glad that this helps you. You know, it, it's not something that I feel like
[39:51.820 --> 39:58.780]  I need, but I wonder how, how it would affect me. I'm not going to find out because it's not
[39:58.780 --> 40:04.620]  something I need to do. I've already been addicted to far too many things. I've Prozac, well, Buterin,
[40:05.260 --> 40:11.260]  uh, alcohol. I was a fucking drunk. Uh, well, Buterin is the one I'm not, I know a little bit
[40:11.260 --> 40:15.900]  what it's for. It's like Prozac. It's an antidepressant. Okay. Um, but I, but like you
[40:15.900 --> 40:19.500]  were saying earlier, I don't like anything controlling me. Right. You know, I don't like
[40:19.500 --> 40:24.460]  anything changing me. I want to be Clint Stewart. And if I'm a fucking asshole, that's how it is.
[40:24.460 --> 40:28.940]  Yes. You know, I need to be able to change me, not a pill changing me. Correct. I mean,
[40:28.940 --> 40:35.180]  so alcohol, cigarettes, two, two, uh, antidepressants, you know, and all at the same
[40:35.180 --> 40:41.100]  time, unfortunately I've, I've given all those up except for the nicotine out of a vaporizer.
[40:41.100 --> 40:45.580]  That thing's the size of a small baseball bat. It's a John Bueno put it best. It's a,
[40:45.580 --> 40:51.020]  it's a little robot dick. It is sucking the hell out of that. I suck the shit out of this thing.
[40:51.020 --> 40:54.700]  So we're into our second podcast of the night. I'm on another podcast with my friend Wade,
[40:54.700 --> 40:58.780]  that's sitting over there. It's called 719 the block. So listen to that. If you'd like to please
[40:58.780 --> 41:03.740]  do a shameless plug, but through the course of two podcasts, uh, Wade has killed a pen,
[41:03.740 --> 41:10.380]  uh, and completely turned to paper, uh, blue and white. And it's beautiful. Oh, thank you,
[41:10.700 --> 41:15.580]  you are going at it over there. That's it. It's the concentration thing, man. Like it really,
[41:15.580 --> 41:19.500]  you're tearing it up. It helps. That paper is going to be all your whole hand is going to be
[41:19.500 --> 41:23.980]  blue on the bottom side right there by the time you're done. Nice. All right. I want to put this
[41:23.980 --> 41:28.460]  show back on track. We got time for a couple of questions, dude. We bring Clint on to do a little
[41:28.460 --> 41:32.620]  bit of cannabis one-on-one. Yeah. Quickly scramble through your phone and find the question. All
[41:32.620 --> 41:36.540]  right. Uh, so classes in session, shoot me a question, bro. We'll try to answer it for the
[41:36.540 --> 41:40.220]  noobs. Well, I'm glad we went over THC levels. Cause that was one of the questions I had,
[41:40.220 --> 41:44.700]  you know, that's something that, that I don't think a lot of people know. And, um, but with,
[41:44.700 --> 41:49.180]  with, I don't know if I asked it last time, but with THC levels for a, for a newcomer, you know,
[41:49.180 --> 41:54.140]  what, what levels would they be looking at? You know, is that something that, that even they,
[41:54.140 --> 41:58.700]  is that something they do at dispensaries? Look at Clint's never even walked into a dispenser.
[41:58.700 --> 42:03.580]  Yeah. Do they have THC levels on the, some of the shops will have the THC level printed,
[42:03.580 --> 42:08.300]  the higher class places will, but it's expensive to get the test done. Okay. Some of them, uh,
[42:08.300 --> 42:15.020]  unfortunately we'll put a higher level to mislead you. Side, uh, side question. Do you believe that
[42:15.020 --> 42:21.740]  there will be a future regulation of marijuana? Good question. Uh, they're already trying to
[42:21.740 --> 42:27.340]  outlaw in Amsterdam. You can't have cannabis over 15 or 17% on the shelves in the coffee shops.
[42:27.340 --> 42:33.500]  Oh, they're doing it like booze. Yeah. Oh, we work. Uh, I don't think it'll come to that.
[42:34.460 --> 42:37.580]  They are trying to ban dabs in California from what I just read.
[42:38.460 --> 42:42.620]  Try to ban everything in California. That's true. That's true. Which, uh, all that does,
[42:42.620 --> 42:45.740]  we know that, you know, what happens when you fucking outlaw shit. I don't even need to go
[42:45.740 --> 42:50.460]  into prohibition prohibition sort of speeches. So, uh, when you go into the shops, a lot of times
[42:50.460 --> 42:55.260]  they do have the THC content listed on the strain. Unfortunately, they'll grow one strain for a year
[42:55.260 --> 42:59.020]  and they get one batch tested and they claim that it's that THC percent the whole time.
[42:59.580 --> 43:03.820]  There's nobody in the future. We will be required to test everything that's on every shelf that
[43:03.820 --> 43:07.420]  goes out of every door at every dispensary. That's pretty much how it should be a little
[43:07.420 --> 43:12.060]  bit though. Shouldn't it? Yeah. I mean, if we have to put ingredients on like, uh,
[43:12.060 --> 43:16.060]  everything but cigarettes. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Right. So, I mean, and we don't want to
[43:16.060 --> 43:20.060]  be classified as cigarettes, honestly. And if you're new, I say we, uh, very loosely,
[43:20.060 --> 43:23.980]  cause I know I'm not, Hey man, you're a part of the community. Well, I am supporting it. You are,
[43:23.980 --> 43:27.820]  you're here, but I don't want anything to people to think, oh, it's like cigarettes. Cause they
[43:27.820 --> 43:30.540]  don't have to like, they don't have this regulation. And I would rather we had the
[43:30.540 --> 43:36.300]  regulation on it. I don't like the way that they said, uh, treat it like alcohol and the regulations
[43:36.300 --> 43:40.700]  cause that made it feel skeezy to me, but it did work. It did work. Unfortunately. Well, you know
[43:40.700 --> 43:45.180]  what? And I was a proponent of saying it, you know, if you're going to treat it like anything,
[43:45.180 --> 43:53.020]  treat it like alcohol. But then after, uh, after like 16 months of smoking, it's the complete wrong
[43:53.020 --> 43:56.940]  mentality to take towards it. Right. And I'm gonna write myself a note cause, uh, I want to talk
[43:56.940 --> 44:01.100]  more about this, but you guys kind of put me off on something I wanted to kind of sidebar on. Yeah.
[44:01.100 --> 44:05.500]  Uh, so if you go into the dispensary, anything is going to be, if it's well-grown, you're going to
[44:05.500 --> 44:11.740]  hit 15, 17% THC, hopefully like the dispensaries. If you're lucky, you're going to find a 22.
[44:12.380 --> 44:17.740]  And that's, that's not super far apart. Honestly, I've seen both, I've smoked both and it's very
[44:17.740 --> 44:22.540]  minute. And it's also the lab that tested it. Some labs you can kind of, if you buddy up and
[44:22.540 --> 44:27.660]  build a relationship, your numbers seem to go higher. And there's some labs I know will not do
[44:27.660 --> 44:34.940]  that because they have high integrity. Fuck yeah. So thank goodness. If you're a noob, like two or
[44:34.940 --> 44:39.500]  three good hits off of a bowl. Like if you're a smoke, if it's your first time, one or two good
[44:39.500 --> 44:45.180]  hits off of a bowl of 20% THC weed will get you stoned. You'll get red eyed and cotton mouth two
[44:45.180 --> 44:49.660]  or three good hits and you'll be like sucked to the couch for a minute. Yeah. So just start with
[44:49.740 --> 44:55.260]  one. Yeah. Start with one. Just start with one. Yeah. Don't be the people that buy an entire
[44:55.260 --> 44:59.980]  fucking TKO bar and an eighth and then go smoke a bowl and then eat the fucking TKO bar and then
[44:59.980 --> 45:04.380]  do something dumb and make us all, I'm going to try one of those. The TKO bars are, I haven't
[45:04.380 --> 45:10.380]  tried too many of the, the brand name edibles, I guess you can say, just because I would rather
[45:10.380 --> 45:15.020]  spend my money on the flower. Yeah. I guess you could say was the TKO one. I know you talked about
[45:15.020 --> 45:20.620]  this on a previous podcast, maybe two or three. It was, it was not tested. Uh, I've tested those
[45:20.620 --> 45:26.860]  and I would fucking, uh, testify that that shit works. I will also testify that it works on Jeff.
[45:28.460 --> 45:33.820]  Yeah. He hung out with me. That shit was, he was on point that night, man. How about the, before I
[45:33.820 --> 45:37.740]  even mentioned the name brand, I bought us a cook. We went, uh, Wade and I went and signed
[45:37.740 --> 45:42.540]  Anthony Jeselnik at comedy works and I bought us each a cookie at a dispensary at a recreational
[45:42.540 --> 45:50.140]  shop. Uh, how'd you feel about that? A hundred milligram cookie. Uh, I think it kicked in after
[45:50.140 --> 45:54.300]  the show and I fell asleep. You did fall asleep. You were kind of talking in your sleep and a little
[45:54.300 --> 45:59.500]  twitchy. Yeah. Uh, that was the growing kitchen. That cookie was on point. It tasted good. Oh yeah.
[45:59.500 --> 46:07.100]  No, there was no, uh, no over there. I, I judge edibles a lot by the over, over marijuana taste.
[46:07.100 --> 46:11.660]  So if you're going to be a pro at it and you're going to like sell marijuana and packages and
[46:11.660 --> 46:16.380]  everything like that, you should be able to get that big weedy taste out in your edibles. Correct.
[46:16.380 --> 46:21.980]  It shouldn't taste like weed. I agree. Correct. Yeah. So great product. Great, great little product,
[46:21.980 --> 46:29.740]  not overly we taste. Uh, and, and I was high throughout the show, but then when, when we
[46:29.740 --> 46:36.620]  re dabbed up after the show, I was fucking done. So now, you know, I get so wrecked when I eat
[46:36.620 --> 46:40.620]  edibles and then take dabs. There's something about just, you feel like you're floating already
[46:40.620 --> 46:45.180]  on an edible and then you take a dab and it's skyrocket. I don't, I don't, I haven't really
[46:45.180 --> 46:48.860]  done that yet. I haven't really put that. I know it's hilarious when you do though.
[46:50.540 --> 46:55.420]  Yeah. It's really that when you took that TKO bar, you took, you went up to Denver to handle
[46:55.420 --> 47:00.940]  some business. You took a TKO bar coming back down. We recorded a podcast that night and your
[47:00.940 --> 47:07.020]  eyes were open. Like man, you were like fucking preaching some fire and it was hilarious. I might
[47:07.020 --> 47:13.660]  have been lit up. You were real quick. Um, so what you're saying is that it, you don't feel like
[47:13.660 --> 47:18.940]  the, the, the cookie kicked in during the show or you said you were high throughout the show.
[47:19.660 --> 47:24.060]  What, what do you mean? Like, um, you were high throughout the show on the cookie.
[47:24.060 --> 47:27.500]  And then once you hit the dab, it was like, I'm done. Is that what you're saying?
[47:29.580 --> 47:35.900]  Or were you guys smoking? I guess my, my real question is, is how long did it take for the
[47:35.900 --> 47:41.740]  cookie to kick in or do you not over an hour easily? For me, it's like about an hour and a
[47:41.740 --> 47:46.940]  half and seeing that's something I'm trying to get at is don't, if it's not going to work
[47:46.940 --> 47:52.380]  immediately, don't just take more and expect it to work. Agreed. That's, um, that's, that's one
[47:52.380 --> 47:57.820]  of my main focuses is people to not overdo something here for me. It's like, so this is
[47:57.820 --> 48:02.940]  where like when dabs come in for me, it's just like whenever I take a dab, the very, like a big
[48:02.940 --> 48:07.580]  dab, right? When Jeff puts a man dab up in front of me, the only thing I think in my head, which I
[48:07.580 --> 48:10.940]  know is impossible. And I would just like to preface this by saying that, but the only thing
[48:10.940 --> 48:18.460]  that goes on my head is, is this, I just don't want to be the first person to die. That's all.
[48:18.460 --> 48:23.900]  Let's I don't want to be that dude. That's like, well, Wade Ridley died from marijuana and now
[48:23.900 --> 48:30.220]  everyone is fucked because I couldn't handle my shit. You won't be the match.com killer anymore.
[48:30.300 --> 48:35.980]  Yeah. I'll be the weed killer. Even better. The one who killed everybody's high. Not just a couple
[48:35.980 --> 48:40.460]  of earlier. I took a dab earlier and I sized dab off of a new rig. Hey, shout out to micron. Mike.
[48:40.460 --> 48:45.100]  I don't know if I said that, but I took a dab off my new rig and uh, I heard the ice cream truck
[48:45.900 --> 48:47.740]  and there was no fucking ice cream truck.
[48:50.140 --> 48:54.700]  It was such a big dad that I 11 o'clock at night. Where's that ice cream truck. Right.
[48:54.700 --> 48:59.580]  I heard it, man. It was, it was all in my head. It was vivid. Are you sure you're not having PTSD
[48:59.660 --> 49:04.940]  mother fucker? Dude, I was a fat kid. So trying to chase that fucker down. I knew he just sped up
[49:04.940 --> 49:09.500]  and looked at the rear view and laughed at me until he got to the corner. Yeah. Nice. Uh, my
[49:09.500 --> 49:14.140]  friend Joey went to a dispensary today. My friend Joey, uh, is a medical marijuana patient. Uh,
[49:14.140 --> 49:17.660]  they didn't have any medical marijuana in the dispensary. However, they had plenty of recreational
[49:17.660 --> 49:24.780]  marijuana, which, uh, is about 25% more in regular price just off the shelf. Plus another 25% tax.
[49:25.660 --> 49:32.300]  Why would they be out of medical? Yeah. Right. That's some bullshit. Uh, if I haven't had time
[49:32.300 --> 49:36.540]  to research it, I got this text message as we were sitting down to record our first podcast today.
[49:36.540 --> 49:41.660]  And I haven't had a time, any time to look at that. Okay. Uh, if you guys, anybody listening
[49:41.660 --> 49:46.780]  has experienced this, if you're a medical patient and your, um, medical marijuana center doesn't
[49:46.780 --> 49:51.740]  have cannabis for you as a medical patient, but they do have rec weed, let's talk about it. Tell
[49:51.740 --> 49:57.260]  me how you feel. Tweet me at I grow culture. Uh, I will speak your voice on the air. I won't say
[49:57.260 --> 50:02.060]  your name. If you don't want, you can send me a private message. Uh, let's get it on. I want to
[50:02.060 --> 50:06.940]  fucking talk about that. That's fucked up. Uh, we didn't legalize cannabis to abandon the people
[50:06.940 --> 50:12.620]  that got our foot in the door. Here's what they'll say is it's free market. You know what I'm saying?
[50:12.620 --> 50:17.500]  It's free market. It is, but it's fucked up. It is compassionate. It's disrespectful. I hate it.
[50:17.580 --> 50:22.300]  And that's, uh, if dude, if you keep punching me in the eye and I don't say, dude, quit fucking
[50:22.300 --> 50:26.540]  punching me in the eye, you'll keep doing it all day. So somebody has got to say, quit fucking
[50:26.540 --> 50:30.780]  punching the patients in the eye because they're the ones that got this going. They're the ones
[50:30.780 --> 50:35.500]  that need this. Uh, we're somebody who's got to be responsible and I can do what I could do.
[50:35.500 --> 50:39.500]  I have a big mouth and I've got a podcast feed and people listen and we can try to figure out
[50:39.500 --> 50:43.420]  what we can do to prevent it or something. Cause it sucks. I think the patients are the ones that
[50:43.420 --> 50:48.700]  got us going dude, but definitely. Well, no, that's a more than accurate statement. I would
[50:48.700 --> 50:55.100]  say like it, medical marijuana was, so when I lived in new Orleans, medical marijuana was active
[50:55.100 --> 51:01.180]  here. When I moved back, it's re it's recreational and legal for everyone. It's not like it was
[51:01.180 --> 51:05.980]  recreational first and then marijuana. Second. Yep. Yep. A lot of people had to put in a lot
[51:05.980 --> 51:09.100]  of work to get it where it is. And we're kind of fucking those people now and it sucks.
[51:09.820 --> 51:13.660]  I didn't even think about that. Yep. That sucks. Yeah. It's happening to people.
[51:13.660 --> 51:18.140]  Hey, uh, you know what you guys should do? Uh, Sunday is mother's day. Get your mom some weed.
[51:19.820 --> 51:24.300]  I don't know. I saw a post today. Uh, it's graduation time in Boulder and I saw a post
[51:24.300 --> 51:30.700]  that said the dispensaries are busier today than they were during four 20 because all the moms and
[51:30.700 --> 51:36.780]  pops need to get some weed for graduation finals are over too. Yeah. Finals are done. So it's like,
[51:37.260 --> 51:42.300]  what can I get you mom? You're going into that fucking store. Okay. You're getting me an eighth
[51:42.300 --> 51:49.660]  of the stickiest of the icky-est and you're driving home. Don't pinch my sack pitch. Right?
[51:49.660 --> 51:53.420]  Don't you fucking touch that thing. So good. All right, dude, I'll give you one more question.
[51:53.420 --> 52:00.540]  If you got a good one on the phone screen there. Um, I know, uh, like, um, like electricity bills
[52:00.620 --> 52:08.940]  for, um, for growers. Like I, I know that not everybody is an outdoor grower. We talked to
[52:08.940 --> 52:15.020]  some guys that, uh, last time we talked to a guy that was an outdoor grower. Um, I'm, I'm wondering,
[52:15.020 --> 52:20.060]  you know, per plant, you know, how many lights are you using or is it one light for four plants?
[52:20.060 --> 52:23.980]  You know, I'm not, I don't know what's, what's common. I'm not trying to get into your business.
[52:23.980 --> 52:30.140]  Exactly. There's a huge, uh, it's kind of a personal preference, how many lights per plant.
[52:30.140 --> 52:35.420]  So, uh, most, uh, most larger grows will be a thousand watt light. Usually, uh, if you've got
[52:35.420 --> 52:39.260]  a bedroom, I've seen guys doing two in a bedroom. Some guys got four in a bedroom. That's usually
[52:39.260 --> 52:43.420]  like your average residential grow. No more than four lights or so in a house. If you're doing an
[52:43.420 --> 52:48.140]  industrial thing, then you need a, what's called phase three electrical. You're an industrial guy.
[52:48.140 --> 52:52.620]  You know what I'm talking about? It's a little, a little more power availability. Uh, it's just
[52:52.620 --> 52:58.780]  going from like 120 volts to, uh, like two 40, two 40, two 40. Yeah. And it's instead of just
[52:58.780 --> 53:04.860]  being a single phase line power going in, um, it's, it's like three phases. I, it's a lot of
[53:04.860 --> 53:09.100]  jargon. Yeah. Yeah. But it's able to harness a lot more power without being a fire hazard.
[53:09.100 --> 53:13.020]  Essentially. Also that is, that's the most intelligent sentence I've ever heard. You know,
[53:13.020 --> 53:17.420]  I was, I was just going to let him have it. I noticed that I was like, man, he is fluent in
[53:17.420 --> 53:21.980]  speech when it comes to some power. You know what's it. Cause I went to school for, uh, for
[53:21.980 --> 53:27.660]  electrical, I was going to do solar powered stuff. I thought, Oh yeah. Whoa. Back when it was a not
[53:27.660 --> 53:33.740]  ridiculously expensive before Vestas came in, like this is a while ago before all the solar
[53:33.740 --> 53:38.940]  power stuff was going on. I thought this is the field I want to get into. So I went to school for,
[53:38.940 --> 53:43.820]  uh, like electronics and stuff. So I actually have like a minor, like understanding of what's
[53:43.820 --> 53:48.540]  going on with that stuff. I'm not saying I know a whole lot, but, um, but as soon as,
[53:48.540 --> 53:55.820]  unfortunately, like, uh, the, the prices of like solar panels and, uh, like wind turbines and stuff
[53:55.820 --> 54:02.060]  like that just skyrocketed windmills and stuff. It's, it's far too expensive to get in and, and
[54:02.060 --> 54:10.220]  have a, uh, profit or save any money within the next 10 years. Oh, I'm sure it sucks. But that's,
[54:10.220 --> 54:16.700]  that's something that, you know, I, I wish that there was a cheaper alternative to those things.
[54:16.700 --> 54:23.020]  That would be like, I carry around a book, uh, solar energy for dummies. Oh no shit. Oh yeah.
[54:23.020 --> 54:28.300]  It's in my backpack. Like it's, it's always on me because I, I, I think that's an amazing
[54:28.300 --> 54:33.100]  industry. Oh yeah. I wish that it was more prevalent because fuck you black Hills. Yes.
[54:33.820 --> 54:38.460]  We had a dispensary downtown. No, we were the only dispensary downtown for a while and they
[54:38.460 --> 54:43.900]  shut us down, but we were running quite a few lights in there. Uh, there were easily 20 grow
[54:43.900 --> 54:47.500]  lights in there. And that I'm going to get back to what your question was. There's easily, there
[54:47.500 --> 54:51.820]  were easily 20 grow lights in there. Plus a more veg light area. And then another downstairs area.
[54:51.820 --> 54:56.780]  And then plus the dispensary business area, we had so much solar on the building, on the roof
[54:56.780 --> 55:01.980]  that we were, uh, our bill was negative. We're getting money back from the company. Cool. Oh,
[55:01.980 --> 55:07.420]  no shit. But you gotta be a dispensary to have that type of funding. And it was that building
[55:07.420 --> 55:11.020]  was actually a health food store before our dispensary took it over. So they had a lot to,
[55:11.020 --> 55:15.420]  they started it and we finished funding it. But if you're running a residential grow,
[55:15.420 --> 55:19.820]  uh, what I've seen from like a caregiver grow, you're going to average about a hundred dollars
[55:19.820 --> 55:24.220]  per thousand watt light per month on your electric bill because you need the light is
[55:24.220 --> 55:28.060]  going to run you so much. You need a couple of fans, you need a blower, you're going to have
[55:28.060 --> 55:32.380]  a couple more accessories that go with that. That'll need to plug in a timer for this and that
[55:32.380 --> 55:36.380]  you're going to be running some, uh, about a hundred dollars per light, uh, through a veg
[55:36.380 --> 55:41.980]  cycle, a hundred dollars per month per month per light. Yeah. Well, but from that one light,
[55:41.980 --> 55:45.740]  if you do it right, you're going to get a pound of weed. If you do it correctly, there's one pound
[55:45.740 --> 55:50.620]  of weed and depending where you are, I don't even want to talk market value, right? Market value on
[55:50.620 --> 55:57.980]  that. Yeah. Well, pure cocaine, Columbia. And I'm going to say that sits me about 3032. You're
[55:57.980 --> 56:01.820]  actually, you're getting, you're talking shit about just about the right numbers. Uh, anywhere
[56:01.820 --> 56:06.300]  from 25 to 35, depending on who you are, what you grew, what you've got, that's about what a pound
[56:06.300 --> 56:10.460]  is going to get you. So that a hundred dollars of electricity, if you do it right, hopefully you
[56:10.460 --> 56:14.380]  spent about a hundred dollars in nutrients, like another hundred on supplies, maybe a hundred on
[56:14.380 --> 56:18.700]  dirt, uh, just maybe 200 on dirt. I'm just guessing off the top of my head now. Yeah. But
[56:18.700 --> 56:23.100]  you're hopefully you can, are able to make that an investment. Uh, hopefully you're able to give
[56:23.100 --> 56:27.020]  a portion to your patients that you're caregiver for and take a portion for yourself to make some
[56:27.020 --> 56:31.580]  hash out of, and then maybe move enough of it to your patients when they run out of their initial
[56:31.580 --> 56:35.100]  gift, they got to pay for the rest and that covers the light bill. Yeah. Hopefully you can work it
[56:35.100 --> 56:40.860]  out that way. Once you go pro do Dean grow pound and a half, two pounds per light, but you just
[56:40.860 --> 56:43.980]  got to get good and have the right genetics. It takes a while that that takes a minute,
[56:43.980 --> 56:48.380]  the right nutrient mix. And that's why we're talking on the genetics guy. Yeah. Yeah. Uh,
[56:48.380 --> 56:53.340]  heart of region, heart of gold, heart of gold harvests, heavy lemon, Jeffrey harvest like a
[56:53.340 --> 56:59.260]  champ. If you're looking for heavy harvesting, heavyweight crops. Uh, yeah, we're almost in an
[56:59.260 --> 57:02.700]  hour. I'm going to kind of in the questions and we're going to, going to do a couple more little
[57:02.700 --> 57:08.140]  quick things. Uh, I remembered, dude, thanks for asking those good questions. We're going to bring
[57:08.140 --> 57:12.300]  Clint back to all the listeners because we didn't get enough questions and he's got a whole list of
[57:12.300 --> 57:17.100]  questions in the phone. Yeah. And if you guys got questions, please, uh, I grow culture on Twitter.
[57:17.100 --> 57:23.100]  See, he's good at advertising and everything. Once in a while. Uh, so I'm just going to read
[57:23.100 --> 57:27.020]  something that this is, I've got a forum. Uh, I'm also I read genetics, Colorado. We've got,
[57:27.020 --> 57:32.780]  I read genetics, colorado.com. If you go, I read genetics, colorado.com slash forum. Uh, I wrote
[57:32.780 --> 57:38.460]  this 10 months and two weeks ago is what I believe it said. I got to scroll up, uh, 10 months and two
[57:38.460 --> 57:42.620]  days ago. And my point is that it's still relevant. Here's a little bit of advice that I decided to
[57:42.620 --> 57:47.820]  rant a while back that says I'm asked tons of questions about growing Ganja. My first piece of
[57:47.820 --> 57:51.820]  advice is to buy yourself a good cannabis grow guide. I recommend something from Ed Rosenthal,
[57:51.820 --> 57:56.540]  Jorge Cervantes, or Greg green, a good grow grow guide will answer most of your questions before
[57:56.540 --> 58:01.100]  they arise. And you will, if you take the time to read the book before you start growing, you can't
[58:01.100 --> 58:04.220]  just buy the book and set it by the shitter. You got to open it up and read it, dude. That's, I
[58:04.220 --> 58:08.940]  didn't type that, but that's how I feel. You got to open it and read that thing from cover to cover
[58:08.940 --> 58:13.180]  before you even get your seeds. All right now onto the reading. Uh, one of my other biggest pieces of
[58:13.180 --> 58:17.660]  advice I can ever share would be to think twice before you do anything new in your garden. If you
[58:17.660 --> 58:21.900]  have a bright idea to try something new that you heard from a friend or read online, take the time
[58:21.900 --> 58:26.940]  to think it through before you attempt it. Anyone can post on the internet and claim to have heavy
[58:26.940 --> 58:31.820]  or have stellar results. Some of those results will not only will only work in specific situations
[58:31.820 --> 58:36.780]  and will often lead to additional problems down the line in your garden. I'm not discouraging you
[58:36.780 --> 58:41.100]  from experimenting in your garden. I strongly encourage experimentation and expanding your
[58:41.100 --> 58:46.540]  skills. I'm encouraging responsible experimentation. You won't learn anything new unless you try new
[58:46.540 --> 58:50.620]  things. Don't be afraid to kill a plant or two, but don't get reckless and kill an entire crop
[58:50.620 --> 58:54.940]  trying an idea you heard at the hydro shop. The next time you get an idea in your garden,
[58:54.940 --> 58:59.260]  you should think about a few things. What is your goal? What's the point of what you're attempting
[58:59.260 --> 59:04.140]  seriously and clearly think about what you're trying to make happen. Cannabis grows. Stop making
[59:04.140 --> 59:07.980]  it more difficult than it needs to be. That's like something that I always tell my friends that are
[59:07.980 --> 59:11.660]  growing weed and they have problems. Stop making it more difficult than it needs to be. This is a
[59:11.660 --> 59:16.700]  weed problem. It grows in Afghanistan on the side of a cliffy ass mountain in the wind and the rain
[59:16.700 --> 59:22.300]  and the sun and it's get beat to shit animals piss in it. Let it grow dude it's gonna you should be
[59:22.300 --> 59:27.660]  cool. It's a weed. It is good weed if you do it right. So now on to my reading. Where did you get
[59:27.660 --> 59:31.980]  this idea? Is the idea from a reputable source or is it a troll online who's never grown a plant
[59:31.980 --> 59:36.060]  but thinks he knows everything? Keep in mind that most of the things you do won't show results for
[59:36.060 --> 59:41.340]  two to five days. You can spray or feed some ridiculous shit today and think everything is
[59:41.340 --> 59:45.900]  cool and then in a few days boom everything is brown and pissed off. Scissoring and pruning are
[59:45.900 --> 59:50.620]  not fixable if you chop off something important. Be mindful of what you're making happen. Every
[59:50.620 --> 59:55.980]  action has an equal and opposite reaction. Plants seem to remind us of this when we try to get
[59:55.980 --> 01:00:01.340]  silly in the garden. If you decide to try something new don't try it out on your whole crop. Test an
[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:05.260]  idea on a plant you have grown a few times and you know exactly what to expect under your normal
[01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:09.740]  conditions. I just got all nasally in my headphones. If you like what you see you can do your new trick
[01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:14.220]  to the entire crop next time. If you do things correctly you'll be running another crop in a
[01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:19.260]  few weeks and you can try new stuff again. Don't try everything new all at once. You can make five
[01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:23.900]  changes and something works. How will you know what made the buds grow like that? Try to make changes
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:29.340]  slowly. If I tune all five things how do I know which one made that bud get really huge?
[01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:33.820]  Once you've thought about your idea twice and considered the long-term effects go
[01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:39.020]  smoke a fat joint and reconsider your idea. Read a cannabis grow guide from a reputable author and
[01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:44.300]  see what they say about your idea. If you post your idea online expect varied replies and please
[01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:48.460]  don't take anyone too seriously. After you've thought about the methods and results of your
[01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:54.300]  idea twice read a grow guide, smoked the joint and reconsidered every detail. Take very good
[01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:59.260]  notes of what you do and follow your heart to reach your goals. Take good notes. Good notes
[01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:02.620]  because that's how we know what we did, what worked, what didn't work. Take good notes.
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:07.420]  So my point here this is still I wrote this months ago and this is still valid.
[01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:10.940]  Just think about what you're doing because you're going to go in there and you're going to be like
[01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:15.420]  I want to try this. Rastajef said to do this online. Maybe I'm growing a heavy indica and
[01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:19.340]  your plant is sativa and you're going to try that and it's just going to put the kibosh right on
[01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:22.540]  your whole crop and now you and your patients are going to be out of weed. But I want you to get
[01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:27.500]  in there and try some shit. So do that to one branch. Do it to one small plant. Don't get reckless
[01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:31.820]  but yeah that's when we're talking about learning new stuff that was my favorite piece of advice
[01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:36.220]  that I could come up with a long time ago. Wanted to share that. That was good man. Thanks dude.
[01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:40.460]  I like to write a little bit. I do have a creative side to me. I did mention I get some books.
[01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:44.860]  This is going to be like an ultimate segue here. I'm going to go from this to some books.
[01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:50.780]  I mentioned some books from Jorge Cervantes or Ed Rosenthal. I'm holding in my hand. No I'm
[01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:56.700]  reaching. I'm lying. I'm reaching for Marijuana Horticulture the Indoor Outdoor Medical Grower's
[01:01:56.700 --> 01:02:01.180]  Bible from Jorge Cervantes. It's been updated since I got this but I'll never let this one go.
[01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:07.340]  He signed the inside for me. This book honestly has gotten you can tell by looking I think this
[01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:13.180]  book has been through hell and has gotten me this is probably a good 50 percent of my grow education
[01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:18.460]  right now. This is the intro book right here if you're going to grow some weed. So we did Jorge
[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:25.500]  Cervantes as our give thanks section last episode. This time we're going to do the author of this
[01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:31.020]  book. This is the Marijuana Grower's Handbook. It's the official course book for Oaksterdam
[01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:38.060]  University. Oaksterdam. Between this book and the Marijuana Horticulture Bible there. Dude you can't
[01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:42.140]  go wrong. All of the answers are in here. If you've got a new problem that's not in this book
[01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:50.060]  we're fucked. We're gonna have to fucking find some new shit. That's awesome man. Those are the
[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:54.940]  two books I recommend everybody grab. You want to put a picture of those up on your Instagram? I
[01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:59.500]  definitely plan on doing that. I'm just going to steal the pictures off of websites and just use
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:04.220]  those high quality shots instead of taking a photo. But that's going to lead me into a section
[01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:07.900]  every episode we do here it's called give thanks where we like to give thanks to somebody who has
[01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:13.180]  contributed heavily to the cannabis movement. Of course I'm talking about Mr. Ed Rosenthal the
[01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:18.540]  author of the Marijuana Grower's Handbook. Ed Rosenthal was born in the Bronx New York in 1944.
[01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:24.220]  This dude's an old cat. He's got to see or he got to see the revolution of cannabis. He was there
[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:28.860]  when having a joint was a serious crime and now he's here where he comes to Colorado and comes to
[01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:33.660]  all the parties and takes dabs. I don't think he dabs. He smokes joints with us. He comes and gets
[01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:39.660]  down now. So he's a California horticulturalist. I can say that word when I'm not reading it.
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:44.780]  That's weird. Horticulturalist. Yeah I still fucked it up. Anyway he's one of those guys an
[01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:49.820]  author, publisher, and a cannabis grower known for his advocacy in the legalization of marijuana use.
[01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:54.620]  He served as a columnist for High Times Magazine during the 80s and 90s. He was arrested in 2002
[01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:59.980]  for cultivation of cannabis by federal authorities who do not recognize authority of states to
[01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:04.540]  regulate the use of medical marijuana. He was convicted in federal court but the conviction
[01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:10.300]  was overturned on appeal. Yay! Rosenthal was subsequently convicted again but was not
[01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:16.380]  resentenced since his original sentence had been completed. Rosenthal briefly attended Youngstown
[01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:22.220]  State University in Youngstown Ohio. Smart as fuck to go there. Yeah yeah. Rosenthal has been active
[01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:26.780]  in promoting and developing policies and civil regulation for medical marijuana with the passage
[01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:32.700]  of California's pioneering Proposition 215 in 1996 which authorizes medicinal use of marijuana.
[01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:37.340]  He worked with the state and local governments to implement the delivery of pharmaceutical grade
[01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:42.300]  cannabis to patients with the doctor's recommendation to use marijuana. He's also the author
[01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:47.500]  of numerous books about the cultivation of marijuana. He wrote like I said one of the most
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:53.500]  essential books that I've got in my book collection. We'll do another guide to this series. I'm going
[01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:59.180]  to make a note to do the next guy. I'm writing his name down. This is who's going to be next in our
[01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:03.820]  give thanks portion but again another author that you got to read who will be next. Ed wrote some
[01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:08.140]  important books. He also comes to Colorado. He goes all over the country all over the world and does
[01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:12.220]  seminars and expos and teaches people about growing weed and the benefits of cannabis. So we got to
[01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:17.580]  give big thanks to Mr. Ed Rosenthal. Much respect, much love. Keep doing it bro. Thanks a lot. You've
[01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:21.820]  taught me a lot. You continue to teach people a lot. He's at Oaksterdam all the time. I think he's
[01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:27.020]  still involved with them. So you can learn a lot from that dude. Read his books. Yeah go buy his book.

[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:47.360]  doing pretty good man you doing good doing good now that you got this recording figured out yeah
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:52.560]  it's been uh it's been a little difficult this evening but uh technology does that sometimes
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:58.960]  i guess i'm not sure it's the technology's fault it might be the dabs the dabs and the phase two
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:05.680]  rig and the torch combination um i'm gonna blame it on technology because everyone has a lot of
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:09.760]  problems with technology all the time so it's common it's much more common that's a good thing
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:15.520]  it's not so rare i like it and we're normal dabbers so i don't really want to admit like so
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:23.600]  much retardedness from dabbing right now i might be i might be dab tarted i like to call myself a
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:30.320]  professional how was your week been bro uh it's been it's been eventful so uh any events you'd

[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:28.800]  so he does that sunday at 4 20. that's exciting well it kind of sucks it's mother's day we should
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:33.920]  be at home with our moms and i gotta go to denver and see doug benson it's worth it so i go up there
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:37.760]  and i see i took my good buddy wade on mother's day we went up there and we saw doug benson and
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:43.680]  actually uh he came after the show and smoked out with wade and myself and a couple other people
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:48.160]  that happen to be diehards that's exciting dude that guy's a really cool normal down to earth guy
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:54.160]  nice so then uh he said that the reason he had to go do uh he did monday or he did sunday sorry he
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:57.600]  did monday in another state and tuesdays because he booked the show and then comedy works saw how
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:02.560]  well it sold and asked him to do something else so then tuesday night was actually the taping of
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:06.480]  doug loves movies which is probably my favorite podcast that's a toss up there are a couple that
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:10.400]  could qualify but yeah so i got to go see the taping of one of my favorite podcasts and then
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:14.880]  once again uh a lot of people really uh they didn't think he was going to come out they were
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:18.880]  really uh i can't think of the word they didn't believe they were not believers that he was going
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:23.840]  to show up and come out and smoke with us but i heard a lot of they were skeptics and um he came
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:27.920]  out and he puffed a big fat joint it was just him and i dude hanging out behind comedy works
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:32.480]  that's dope i gave him an irie genetics t-shirt so if anybody sees doug benson wearing that irie

[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:58.080]  photoshoppedness if that happens boom boom uh yeah that's enough ranting and bragging i got to
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:03.040]  hang out with doug benson that was pretty damn awesome so we both had a pretty pretty nice week
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:08.160]  pretty positive week going on that's awesome yep yeah bringing the irie vibes i read something
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:13.280]  weird in the news today uh minnesota passes concentrate only medical marijuana bill did i
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:18.320]  tell you about this concentrate only yeah wow i'll read the article and then we'll talk about it for
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:23.120]  a second here okay uh though qualifying minnesota medical marijuana patients will only have the
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:27.600]  option of vaporizing and eating concentrated forms of marijuana at least they'll have access
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:32.800]  less than two months ago medical marijuana seemed dead at least as far as legislative
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:38.080]  session was concerned but during a press conference this afternoon scott dibble and carly millen
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:43.280]  announced that senate and house have come together on a medical marijuana compromise
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:48.000]  dibble said the compromise bill is based on the more restrictive house model there will be eight
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:53.440]  so-called alternative care centers around the state qualifying conditions for a medical cannabis
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:15:00.160]  prescription include cancer terminal illness glaucoma hiv aids and crohn's disease ptsd isn't
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:04.320]  included in the qualifying condition dibble indicated he isn't happy about that but said
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:09.440]  it's a compromise it's not a perfect process patients won't be able to smoke or vaporize
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:13.680]  loose leaf marijuana but will have access to whole plant extracts as dibble put it
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:19.440]  rep dan schoen characterized the bill as the strictest and most regulated in the country as
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:25.680]  far as medical marijuana goes uh governor mark daton announced he'll sign the bill into law
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:30.960]  even before this afternoon's press conference even began oh he announced that he would before
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:36.720]  the conference began uh there's a lot of i should have stopped on a lot of things here
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:43.280]  uh loose leaf cannabis made me chuckle uh we call that flowers that's weed that's cannabis
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:49.920]  buds yeah that's no actual cannabis that's what it is marijuana so they're gonna be alternative
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:56.080]  care centers around the state and i think what you're gonna be able to do is medicate there
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:00.880]  i don't think they're because they're not gonna give you any flowers it doesn't sound like does
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:06.720]  it concentrates so i think they'll probably sell concentrates but does that mean because
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:14.160]  isn't dabbing vaporizing kind of is so that's how you smoke oils is you vaporize them uh
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:19.920]  yeah and another stupid thing ptsd isn't included as a qualifying yeah that's that's freaking
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:24.320]  retarded yeah because there's first of all there's evidence i guess you can't prove if it's helping
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:28.880]  your ptsd really you can't maybe you can't if you're a psychologist i have but i have
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:36.480]  paid i have patients that come into my shop that are former uh military veterans and stuff and they
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:43.280]  uh man does it help them and their quality of life yeah and their family's quality of life
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:48.240]  because of what the ptsd does and the other option is what they do if they don't have cannabis is
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:52.480]  they drink alcohol and that's never good for anybody's family i've actually had one patient
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:58.880]  that i cured with cannabis from an alcohol addiction for many many years and he hasn't
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:04.720]  he keeps coming back and hasn't used alcohol since he came in the first time the first time he came
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:10.880]  in he didn't know anything about marijuana neat so yeah definitely so something that uh really is
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:19.440]  weird here there whoever who pushed this bill who set this up to get past this way this is a failure
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:26.800]  in my opinion he says uh uh it's a compromise it's not a perfect process dude you just signed
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:32.560]  up for bullshit that kind of cock blocked any of the stuff that would have been useful i'm not
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:40.000]  saying that edibles and uh capsules and concentrates are not the way to go but the main the
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:45.520]  way we discover the effectiveness of cannabis the best way to consume the natural way the real way
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:54.160]  is to just smoke raw right that's what's been done for thousands of years yeah and and we need that
[01:17:54.160 --> 01:18:01.680]  to make anything else yeah we need that quality flour and that research and that that everything
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:10.240]  still being done on on on the plant because we need that plant to its full potential to be able
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:16.160]  to make the concentrated medicine right so i wonder how i wonder who's going to be making
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:23.360]  the concentrates for these guys the strictest regulations in the medical marijuana game that's
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:30.400]  i haven't heard anything about this yet but all right yeah we'll see um we'll see what comes out
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:33.920]  of there and what yeah what happens when if you guys are in states that are proposing medical
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:39.440]  marijuana regulations don't settle for stuff like that you can you can language your bills
[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:45.760]  your proposed bills can be languaged in the way that work for you yeah be smart about it and make
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:52.240]  sure that you are able to consume raw loose leaf material and flowers definitely that's available
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:56.640]  make sure you enable yourself to grow make sure that each person is allowed to grow cannabis when
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:19:00.160]  you're when you're if you're the persons that are involved in writing these bills and proposing this
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:05.440]  if that's your responsibility make sure you're able to grow make sure there's access and please
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:12.080]  stop the cbd only treatments yes please i've ranted about that before but if you're one of
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:15.920]  the people that's helping i keep telling all kinds of people that come in from other states that
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:21.440]  they're talking about the cbd only stuff that's going on wherever they're from or whatever i'd
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:27.680]  let them know that that's not not the way to go we need this whole plant it's not one specific
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:34.560]  chemical that does this thing it's the combination of of what's in the plant and sometimes cbd is the
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:40.960]  way to go for some folks but man i believe it's higher cbd not just cbd yeah it's the entourage
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:45.600]  it needs it needs the mix of everything else to work correctly sanjay gupta i think is who
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:49.440]  coined the phrase the entourage effect i'm not sure if that was him but that's all the cannabinoids
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:55.280]  working together yes yeah so yeah i'm gonna move on because we could go about that one all day yeah
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:59.280]  for sure this is kind of an old piece of news here oh it's actually from today state approved
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:07.280]  marijuana testing labs in colorado can't accept private pot samples yeah uh luckily i am part of a
[01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:12.240]  facility where i'm able to get my stuff tested so it helps me search for phenotypes it helps me
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:18.960]  decide what i need for each patient uh unfortunately the average citizen cannot go and get his stuff
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:23.760]  tested i'll read it to you colorado medical and retail marijuana testing labs licensed by the
[01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:27.920]  marijuana enforcement division can no longer accept and test private samples dropped off by
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:32.400]  patients and caregivers legally they're only allowed to test marijuana from state licensed
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:37.120]  marijuana facilities for new listeners the marijuana enforcement division is the group we
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:42.480]  talk about all the time they are in charge of their exactly what they sound like the enforcement
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:47.920]  division they're able to show up at your dispensary and inspect everything they are attached to the irs
[01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:53.200]  they are seriously involved with all of the medical marijuana the recreational marijuana
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:58.640]  business they are heavily regulating all of it so officials say the move keeps the state out of
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:02.720]  the federal government's crosshairs by maintaining a tight lock on marijuana inventory but it also
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:07.040]  punishes homegrowing patients who want to know what they're putting in their bodies and prevents
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:12.080]  objective third-party tests from being conducted on products currently for sale so what they're
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:18.320]  saying is i'm a caregiver and kevin's my patient i've got another patient that uh would really like
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:22.800]  some super high cbd medicine and i have one strain that i work with that's really super high i've got
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:30.160]  another one coming up i'm just finding the keeper uh if kevin if i weren't growing with a dispensary
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:34.480]  or involved with dispensaries and had those shops growing my products growing my seed packs i
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:40.240]  wouldn't be able to get these things tested uh if kevin were his own caregiver he wouldn't be able
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:45.760]  to take his medicine to the to these places and have it tested to find the high cbd strain that he
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:50.560]  needs or the high thc strain that he needs and that's who it should be all about as the patient
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:55.760]  so they're kind of screwing the caregiver over on this one essentially you just got to grow a bunch
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:22:02.160]  of weed and smoke it and find what works for you and that's what works instead of being able to just
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:08.080]  you know take a nug off of each of your plant and take a gram and go have each one tested and know
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:14.320]  what's going to work for you and another thing that we can't do uh we can't test for molds or
[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:22.400]  pesticides or pathogens or any type of heavy metals or contaminants uh i i have faith in my growing
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:25.680]  but wouldn't you like to know once in a while i mean that's how you know if you're doing right
[01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:30.000]  just take a sample to the lab and luckily i can do it i just got a bunch of stuff tested and i hate
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:35.280]  to brag but i hit pretty freaking awesome numbers and zero contaminants pathogens problems pesticides
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:42.880]  it was all clean so luckily i'm hooked up like that according to the med the rule hasn't been in
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:48.160]  effect since october 15th of 2013 but it wasn't being followed at least not so strictly that the
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:52.480]  denver post wasn't able to get independent tests done on edibles as recently as march through steep
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:59.440]  hill halen and med license lab dor officials that's department of revenue officials haven't
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:03.840]  admitted that those tests which showed an embarrassing lack of oversight on behalf of the med
[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:08.320]  spurred the sudden enforcement of the rule and announcement of the change but the timing is
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:13.440]  curious and brings up another point westward and the post as well as many other as any other media
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:18.480]  outlet will no longer be able to do our own independent tests at state verified marijuana labs
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:25.680]  so i'm going to recap a couple episodes ago we talked about uh the westward bought edibles from
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:29.920]  dispensaries and took them to labs to be tested and we found out that there's some bullshit going
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:38.240]  on there and now with these new rules maybe those tests reminded the regulators that this rule is in
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:41.840]  place and we shouldn't they forgot nobody's enforcing it so we think we kind of got their
[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:46.640]  attention by maybe putting it in the paper but then also now we can't do that anymore a normal
[01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:50.720]  guy like you and i if we get an edible and we're like this one's crap and we save half of it we
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:55.680]  can't take it down to the testing lab and say test this for me so we've kind of been blocked out
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:24:00.720]  which i don't think is cool i don't think is cool so that's another thing if you uh if you're
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:07.360]  setting up legalization in your state make sure that the testing is available for anybody not just
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:12.480]  uh state licensed facilities because not everybody can afford the state licensing not everybody needs
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:16.000]  to be state licensed as long as you're a caregiver i think you should have the right to get your
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:23.520]  stuff tested i agree i agree with myself all right i'm gonna see if i got another news topic in here
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:28.720]  read one more news topic and then we'll get into uh my good buddy jesse came over a little earlier
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:35.040]  and we recorded some stuff about outdoor growing so this may be a little bit old to some of you i
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:39.120]  wanted to talk about it on the show but we've been so busy that i had a lot of news going on and this
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:43.040]  week uh there ain't shit in the weed news i'm sorry for that kind of a good thing because it
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:51.200]  let us get to the grow episode anyway um house bill 1361 which limits hash hash sales and house
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:58.480]  bill 1366 which further regulate edible sales were approved by the state senate on third on the
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:03.200]  third reading yesterday and now i head to the governor's desk for signing and then there is an
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:07.920]  update oh that's the update the original post i read that kind of backwards i'll tell you what
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:12.320]  they're uh what they're signing a bill limiting how much marijuana concentrate can be sold
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:18.400]  in state and out to in-state and out-of-state residents who are age 21 and older as well as
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:23.360]  legislation placing new rules on marijuana edibles appear on track to become state law
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:29.440]  as lawmakers try to wrap up a 2014 session loaded with weed bills by wednesday afternoon damn that
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:33.280]  was a mouthful of words i'm gonna take a drink of some coconut water here give me one second
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:37.760]  quick second taking a drink here we go shout out to coconut water by the way
[01:25:41.850 --> 01:25:46.410]  you know if you buy the coconut water do not get one with lemon in it there are a lot of tasty
[01:25:46.410 --> 01:25:50.490]  flavors there's mango there's pineapple there's citrusy ones don't get the one with the lemon
[01:25:51.130 --> 01:25:56.330]  i had to try it once okay oh dude i don't really ever drink coconut water i don't really know what
[01:25:56.330 --> 01:26:01.130]  that's about but it's good for you it's good for you i don't know what it is tastiness is it water
[01:26:01.130 --> 01:26:05.210]  from a coconut it's water from a coconut it's pretty much uh the package says it's like sticking
[01:26:05.210 --> 01:26:10.410]  a straw on a coconut and i think it's accurate okay yeah get the ones with some fruit juice
[01:26:10.410 --> 01:26:13.930]  in it if you're new though it'll it'll kind of be different the first time you try it you won't be
[01:26:13.930 --> 01:26:20.330]  ready for that all right that was a big plug for coconut water word all right house bill 1361 would
[01:26:20.330 --> 01:26:25.290]  charge the department of revenue with establishing how much hash or concentrates equal to an ounce
[01:26:25.290 --> 01:26:29.770]  of marijuana the measure has already been greenlit by the state house and it passed on a second
[01:26:29.770 --> 01:26:35.130]  reading in the state senate yesterday without any amendments as a result the bill could have its
[01:26:35.130 --> 01:26:40.570]  third reading as early as today as we pointed out last month the bill's wording doesn't seem to make
[01:26:40.570 --> 01:26:45.450]  it clear whether the dor is meant to measure the total thc in an ounce or the total amount of hash
[01:26:45.450 --> 01:26:50.970]  or concentrate that can be produced from an ounce neither does the legislation address the potency
[01:26:50.970 --> 01:26:56.970]  of the flowers to be tested whatever the final interpretation the net effect adds up to the same
[01:26:56.970 --> 01:27:02.010]  thing consumers will no longer be able to walk out of a shop with 28 grams of hash far fewer than
[01:27:02.010 --> 01:27:08.250]  that probably out-of-state consumers who are already limited to a quarter ounce of herb at a
[01:27:08.250 --> 01:27:13.610]  time will be limited to a quarter ounce of herbs equivalent in hash how are they going to regulate
[01:27:13.610 --> 01:27:19.450]  that bro because um about a gram they'll probably limit it to a gram you think that'll be it for
[01:27:19.450 --> 01:27:25.050]  out-of-state they'll probably say a gram for out-of-state and they'll probably do an eighth
[01:27:25.050 --> 01:27:33.050]  for in-state maybe up to a quarter maybe not depends on what you know yeah what because i've
[01:27:33.210 --> 01:27:39.530]  they may do five grams and this is where uh it doesn't say that they haven't decided they don't
[01:27:39.530 --> 01:27:45.850]  even know how to decide yet how is a bill being passed when they don't have uh when they don't
[01:27:45.850 --> 01:27:50.890]  have it written or the or the law it's likely it's not uh the next line says it's likely that the dor
[01:27:50.890 --> 01:27:54.650]  will create a working group later this year to iron out details as the department has done with
[01:27:54.650 --> 01:27:59.690]  marijuana centric legislation in the past so they're gonna go about it backwards again yeah
[01:28:00.010 --> 01:28:05.530]  like they're gonna play back so like every fucking three months there's gonna be new regulation and
[01:28:05.530 --> 01:28:11.930]  new regulation and everyone's gonna get audited and fucked with just because they can't figure
[01:28:11.930 --> 01:28:20.570]  out what look dude you can get off of good nugs you can get fucking 25 percent like but
[01:28:20.570 --> 01:28:28.570]  fucking average it to 20 off of a nugg run put it on 10 as a trim run fuck you got seven grams
[01:28:28.570 --> 01:28:35.450]  that's about 0.7 if you got nugg run that's about 1.4 so you average it out one one gram
[01:28:36.010 --> 01:28:41.290]  have you ever have you ever seen any legislators think like that no but have you ever asked some
[01:28:41.290 --> 01:28:46.890]  of us in the community they they try but they try to listen to forget that try to listen to some
[01:28:46.890 --> 01:28:52.410]  people that for sure i agree no yeah like yeah a hash maker if you want to limit it to the same
[01:28:52.410 --> 01:28:57.370]  thing as buying an ounce whatever that makes and concentrate fucking pick an average number
[01:28:58.170 --> 01:29:03.610]  and that's it pick one that's in the middle of the low end and the high end and go with that that's
[01:29:04.970 --> 01:29:10.090]  nice round number yeah like i like it they should just take uh they should make a tube that holds
[01:29:10.090 --> 01:29:14.410]  perfectly an ounce and just blast that into containers and there you go that's that's your
[01:29:14.410 --> 01:29:20.330]  one ounce worth of concentrates for sale no don't do that little to-go portion i'm just being a
[01:29:20.330 --> 01:29:27.130]  smart ass here yeah all right so in a related measure house bill 1366 which would ban edible
[01:29:27.130 --> 01:29:33.690]  manufacturers manufacturers from making pot infused foods that and in quotes a reasonable
[01:29:33.690 --> 01:29:39.610]  consumer would confuse with the trademarked food product yeah so that means that the reefers and
[01:29:39.610 --> 01:29:45.130]  the kiff cat those are now banned in colorado it also looks like it will become law in addition
[01:29:45.130 --> 01:29:49.690]  the bill prohibits edible makers from making pot foods that are primarily marketed to children
[01:29:49.690 --> 01:29:52.730]  and i'm sorry that i shouted out reefers and kiff cat but those were the obvious ones that i
[01:29:52.730 --> 01:29:57.370]  thought of i don't mean to point you but uh keep keep your recipe the same and shape everything
[01:29:57.370 --> 01:30:04.650]  like a weed leaf yep then it can't then it can't be confused yep yep uh so the bill will require
[01:30:04.650 --> 01:30:08.650]  more stringent packaging and labeling from the marijuana industry the bill's authors say the
[01:30:08.650 --> 01:30:12.410]  moves are needed to protect children while advocates have said the language is so vague
[01:30:12.410 --> 01:30:17.050]  that it might even prevent them from making marijuana cookies the state marijuana enforcement
[01:30:17.050 --> 01:30:22.970]  division is also working on limiting the potency of edibles and is also discussing a labeling system
[01:30:24.490 --> 01:30:28.250]  they're still having a fucking uh i thought they already hashed out labeling
[01:30:30.970 --> 01:30:37.610]  gonna change it again exactly yeah well because they're gonna change potency guidelines again
[01:30:37.610 --> 01:30:42.090]  well yeah but that's do you change the number on the fucking potency
[01:30:42.810 --> 01:30:47.850]  if you like it's you don't have to rearrange all the packaging that kind of relates to something
[01:30:47.850 --> 01:30:52.730]  we talked about a couple of days ago uh how are we gonna measure the potency of these uh
[01:30:53.290 --> 01:30:57.930]  these edibles if the labs can't get their shit together and kind of agree on a standard of how
[01:30:57.930 --> 01:31:01.930]  they're gonna test they all do different tests if we took one lab or one candy bar to another lab
[01:31:01.930 --> 01:31:07.610]  and one to another it'll be different well that's why not very many labs are licensed to do that
[01:31:07.610 --> 01:31:15.370]  right now very true very very true that's why it's very limited and that's why there's back
[01:31:15.370 --> 01:31:20.570]  orders on fucking products because there's only a couple fucking places to get tested and all
[01:31:20.570 --> 01:31:28.010]  these companies have to send all of their stuff to get tested there and wait for the results
[01:31:28.810 --> 01:31:34.570]  and wait that's hundreds of companies in colorado have to do that yeah yeah wow i didn't even think
[01:31:34.570 --> 01:31:39.210]  of that many companies all right well i posted something on facebook just out of curiosity i said
[01:31:39.210 --> 01:31:43.050]  how much does a bag of herb cost where you live uh what do you pay for an eighth a quarter or an
[01:31:43.050 --> 01:31:48.330]  ounce what's the quality what country do you live in i should have put state i put what country i
[01:31:48.330 --> 01:31:54.090]  was curious what state or country do you live in uh is cannabis legal in your area and then i said
[01:31:54.090 --> 01:32:00.730]  that i'm gathering info for a podcast so i'm scrolling down uh santa cruz california he says
[01:32:00.730 --> 01:32:06.730]  150 a zip all day for bomb indoor which i believe you that's santa cruz you must know somebody
[01:32:07.290 --> 01:32:14.250]  uh another guy says 25 and 8 50 a quarter 175 an ounce quality is 7 to 8 out of a 10 organic flushed
[01:32:14.250 --> 01:32:19.450]  cured very nice genetics western colorado uh he says it's legal but dispensaries are banned in my
[01:32:19.450 --> 01:32:25.930]  county so caregivers only good caregiver they're hooking up 25 and 8 175 an ounce nice work uh
[01:32:25.930 --> 01:32:33.690]  ventura county 140 an ounce for legal medical use uh some indoor some good indoor tons of great
[01:32:33.690 --> 01:32:38.490]  quality outdoor uh there's some answers that i think might be bullshit people just trying to brag
[01:32:39.370 --> 01:32:42.650]  they keep passing one guy said standard street prices uh
[01:32:44.410 --> 01:32:49.370]  dude what what is that where are you what are standard street exactly bro wherever you are
[01:32:50.330 --> 01:32:56.330]  um illinois past medical but it's going to take some time before many people can even get their
[01:32:56.330 --> 01:33:01.530]  license multiple doctor visits at cost and there are no dispensaries in this state as of yet so
[01:33:01.530 --> 01:33:05.370]  even if you do have your medical marijuana you can't get any weed anywhere in illinois it looks
[01:33:05.370 --> 01:33:13.530]  like uh this guy says 10 grams 30 aids 150 ounces in baker's field uh we're the only county in cali
[01:33:13.530 --> 01:33:18.970]  where they voted to ban dispensaries and there's about 30 now that's funny flint michigan wholesale
[01:33:19.050 --> 01:33:27.530]  200 ounces retail 325 an ounce uh this guy wrote retail and wholesale prices so it looks like a
[01:33:27.530 --> 01:33:34.170]  retail for a quarter is 50 he kind of didn't do it all in the same order so i got to figure out
[01:33:34.170 --> 01:33:39.210]  which one he meant but 30 and 8 for top shelf in flint michigan is what it looks like uh oregon
[01:33:39.210 --> 01:33:43.930]  you're looking at 40 and 8 90 a quarter uh for grade triple a weed i believe you there the
[01:33:43.930 --> 01:33:50.890]  detroit area 250 an ounce uh this guy says he's in stanwood washington we're looking at flowers
[01:33:50.890 --> 01:33:58.010]  10 to 15 a gram here concentrates 20 to 60 a gram um gives a shout out to a place where he works and
[01:33:58.010 --> 01:34:04.570]  then says thank you kim so if you're this guy's freaking uh collective employer thank you kim
[01:34:04.570 --> 01:34:10.330]  that's cool if you're keeping this guy supplied with medicine uh the philly area 50 to 60 and 8
[01:34:10.330 --> 01:34:18.570]  100 to 120 a quarter uh 300 to 375 for an ounce never much of a selection but not bad either
[01:34:19.930 --> 01:34:25.770]  so uh looks like prices are varying a little bit from 200 to 350 oh this guy south carolina 350
[01:34:25.770 --> 01:34:34.810]  to 500 an ounce quality is so far not legal jeez yeah come out to colorado you can pay that and
[01:34:34.890 --> 01:34:40.730]  get some dankity dank and fucking be legal at a medical shop or an erection yeah you can come
[01:34:40.730 --> 01:34:46.090]  into a shop and get fucking bad assness for that price somebody just chimed in
[01:34:46.090 --> 01:34:49.930]  around 230 an ounce for b grade buds near missoula montana
[01:34:51.930 --> 01:34:55.610]  oh somebody messaged me too they didn't want to post it on there so we'll read we got two
[01:34:55.610 --> 01:35:01.290]  private messages jacksonville florida uh ounces of accurate strain cali and colorado ship flower
[01:35:01.290 --> 01:35:08.810]  goes for 50 100 200 350 1100 if you say ship flower yeah so don't ship i'm not gonna read
[01:35:08.810 --> 01:35:13.290]  the rest of your stuff because you're shipping stuff we talk about fucking ship weed don't ship
[01:35:13.290 --> 01:35:20.170]  any fucking weed products god damn it we've talked about it several times obviously you don't listen
[01:35:20.170 --> 01:35:28.330]  to podcasts that's right uh let's see zips are 200 from the garden 250 from a friend
[01:35:28.730 --> 01:35:32.890]  10 plus from the dispensary i don't know what 10 means 10 plus from the dispensary
[01:35:32.890 --> 01:35:38.410]  the lower the price the better the quality in that order bless oh it must mean like a 10 grade 10 plus
[01:35:40.810 --> 01:35:45.610]  people just have a hard time typing i think sometimes so i just wanted to share with you
[01:35:45.610 --> 01:35:50.090]  what prices are of cannabis across the nation uh right now in colorado there are eighths
[01:35:50.090 --> 01:35:56.970]  of top-notch super dank crystally dank homegrown nugs by homegrown i mean by a caregiver which
[01:35:57.210 --> 01:36:02.250]  loved his plants they were all organic nothing funky put in them uh you're looking about 25
[01:36:02.250 --> 01:36:09.210]  and 8th if you know the guy if you're out of the loop maybe up to 35 ounces are 200 bucks all day
[01:36:09.210 --> 01:36:15.050]  long in colorado you can find them for 150 i've seen them for 250 if you go to the shops you may
[01:36:15.050 --> 01:36:18.410]  uh you may feel a little dirty it's a little more expensive there you want to tell us what
[01:36:18.410 --> 01:36:23.850]  uh reckon medical prices are bro since you're more informed um well it depends on the shop but
[01:36:24.570 --> 01:36:34.170]  medical prices will go from 150 to 260 i've seen it for an ounce just depends on the shop
[01:36:34.170 --> 01:36:40.250]  and the weed and the weed but sometimes you can get good deals you just never know but um
[01:36:41.210 --> 01:36:48.490]  average is about 180 200 okay for an ounce and then um rec i haven't really i haven't
[01:36:48.490 --> 01:36:53.690]  been to any other rec shops but mine so i couldn't say really do you want to tell us what
[01:36:53.690 --> 01:37:03.530]  you charge for an ounce of recreational weed at your shop uh regular shelf is uh 395 i think
[01:37:04.810 --> 01:37:13.930]  and then before tax and then uh thank you and then uh top shelf for the badass shit
[01:37:14.650 --> 01:37:26.090]  is um 460 before tax you're looking at about 460 after tax and 540 after tax man bang on the
[01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:34.170]  quality of weed you want 80 bucks worth of tax on an ounce of weed that's 17.4 so yeah ouch ouch
[01:37:34.170 --> 01:37:40.410]  ouch ouch a 65 dollar eight they'll cost you 76 and change can i divide my ounce into four separate
[01:37:40.410 --> 01:37:45.610]  quarters it's gonna cost you quarter prices oh my god you're not even gonna hook a brother up and
[01:37:45.610 --> 01:37:53.130]  give me we can't oh my god dude this is the way the tax is we gotta fucking pay for the tax on
[01:37:53.130 --> 01:38:02.410]  that shit all right i need to go change my pants after that um we're gonna uh fade out here real
[01:38:02.410 --> 01:38:06.250]  quick and we're gonna bring in the outdoor grow lesson from our good friend jesse and then we'll
[01:38:06.250 --> 01:38:11.370]  also be back with a very special give thanks portion stay tuned this portion of the podcast
[01:38:11.370 --> 01:38:15.690]  is brought to you by our good friends at oil slick check out oil slick pad.com for more information
[01:38:15.690 --> 01:38:20.170]  oil slick tools to help you concentrate all right ladies and gentlemen wow that's loud sorry all
[01:38:20.170 --> 01:38:24.010]  right we're hanging out here with my good buddy jesse anyway i was talking to jesse the other day
[01:38:24.010 --> 01:38:28.570]  he sent me a text message he's like hey bro the outdoor season's coming and i want to teach people
[01:38:28.570 --> 01:38:32.970]  how to grow outdoor and he's like if we're gonna do it we got to do it soon because it's getting
[01:38:32.970 --> 01:38:37.850]  warm it's getting nice and i said how about tonight so the dude is here we got jesse over
[01:38:37.850 --> 01:38:42.250]  there on the mic say what's up bro hey what's up bro he said hey what's up bro he's a puppet
[01:38:43.610 --> 01:38:47.450]  thanks for coming on dude thanks for coming to share some knowledge with us for sure uh
[01:38:48.410 --> 01:38:53.930]  i guess i should start how long have you been growing outdoors um this will be my seventh or
[01:38:53.930 --> 01:39:00.730]  eighth season um some of my earliest memories in life are kind of running around uh in a dope patch
[01:39:01.610 --> 01:39:09.130]  yeah it's uh uh seven or eight years but on my own though so that's i've been around that's
[01:39:09.130 --> 01:39:12.730]  respectable yeah sounds like you know what you're doing yeah uh sounds like your parents are a bunch
[01:39:12.730 --> 01:39:17.530]  of damn hippies from the way you talk they've been accused of that they've been accused of that
[01:39:17.530 --> 01:39:21.450]  we won't pry too much there i had weighed on and asked about his dad and it almost made him cry
[01:39:23.850 --> 01:39:28.570]  i'm just picking on you and i love you bro uh so your fondest uh your earliest memories are
[01:39:28.570 --> 01:39:32.410]  running around in a dope patch yeah i have some super fond memories of that because the images
[01:39:32.410 --> 01:39:38.970]  that come through my head are just joyous yeah uh i wore overalls a lot as a child barefoot um
[01:39:38.970 --> 01:39:44.810]  in the mountains you know i bet you had that beard when you were a kid he's got a level 10 beard
[01:39:44.810 --> 01:39:52.090]  yeah it's pro status shit um yeah funny story i used to think my dad was a skunk farmer um so
[01:39:52.890 --> 01:39:58.570]  i bet a lot of people yeah agree with that that knew him yeah and then and then you know always
[01:39:58.570 --> 01:40:04.410]  in the fall he he went hunting for skunks and that's why the freezer stunk nice yeah out there
[01:40:04.410 --> 01:40:10.410]  for a couple days chopping down all the skunks yeah awesome bastards um yeah dude if you want
[01:40:10.410 --> 01:40:15.530]  if i wanted to start growing outdoors in colorado or even california or most of the warmer parts of
[01:40:15.530 --> 01:40:20.170]  the country now is the time right oh yes you gotta get those holes dug and start getting clones out
[01:40:20.170 --> 01:40:27.610]  there yep um if you're lucky you're well if you're not in colorado you've started earlier so
[01:40:27.610 --> 01:40:32.730]  um guys in cali are already in the ground i suspect yeah um
[01:40:35.290 --> 01:40:38.650]  catching my breath from that yeah we took some dabs earlier it'll take us a minute to get rolling
[01:40:38.650 --> 01:40:41.850]  but we'll get it started don't worry can you put the mic just a little closer to your face yeah
[01:40:41.850 --> 01:40:48.410]  there you go i know you're shy but we'd like to hear um yeah so ideally you know if you're
[01:40:48.410 --> 01:40:53.690]  growing from seed um you've wanted to start a long time ago um especially if you're growing
[01:40:53.690 --> 01:40:59.690]  from regular seed so that you can sex them yeah sex them um even possibly you're growing a clone
[01:40:59.690 --> 01:41:05.530]  of the original seed plant outdoors um that's kind of complicated so trying to stay more basic
[01:41:06.170 --> 01:41:14.170]  um feminize seeds are great for that um absolutely hence irie genetics um i haven't done it yet but
[01:41:14.170 --> 01:41:19.450]  i suspect uh some heart of gold would kill outdoors here so yeah thanks for that yeah i
[01:41:19.450 --> 01:41:24.650]  would agree with that too uh some was grown last year in maryland i think oh and it was awesome
[01:41:24.650 --> 01:41:33.210]  yeah it was well done nice um so clones you can start a little little later um you know ideally
[01:41:33.210 --> 01:41:40.890]  by this point you got about a 12 to 18 foot little bush inch yeah yeah i'll correct you
[01:41:41.290 --> 01:41:48.010]  don't get carried no no no no 18 foot no that'd be some weight so you get got a 12
[01:41:48.010 --> 01:41:53.930]  hopefully we've got a 12 inch to 18 inch little bush yeah um it's been topped lots of times okay
[01:41:53.930 --> 01:41:57.450]  uh guys we'll i'll make a note to talk about topping in the future because that's a whole
[01:41:57.450 --> 01:42:02.570]  another topic that i'll get into uh quickly that just uh it kind of divides the growth and makes
[01:42:03.450 --> 01:42:11.290]  one growing oh man i just got complicated uh basically uh you take the top shoot out of the
[01:42:11.290 --> 01:42:15.610]  plant the main top part that you're gonna tell is gonna grow a big top cola and you cut that
[01:42:15.610 --> 01:42:20.570]  branch out and hopefully you just left a nice y-shaped intersection with two tops now and
[01:42:20.570 --> 01:42:26.170]  instead of one uh one giant cola you're gonna get two nice fat colas that are gonna hopefully weigh
[01:42:26.170 --> 01:42:31.050]  more than that one would have yeah that's the theory and if you learn to do it in the right
[01:42:31.050 --> 01:42:36.330]  spots at the right time you can create a fucking dragon with 55 heads on it if you know what you're
[01:42:36.330 --> 01:42:41.210]  doing if you start early enough and that's when uh that's when the outdoor stuff gets good is when
[01:42:41.210 --> 01:42:46.650]  you're talking several times big big bushes uh christmas trees the the stuff that everyone
[01:42:46.650 --> 01:42:51.370]  imagines yeah the stuff that you dream about yeah you see little you think a little elves
[01:42:51.370 --> 01:42:55.930]  the stock should be uh at least as big around as your finger by now your middle finger maybe a
[01:42:55.930 --> 01:43:04.970]  little thicker yeah um and you know actually we kind of had a cold snap here locally um that might
[01:43:04.970 --> 01:43:11.130]  have kind of rained on a few people's parade yeah people went out early they had some shit but norm
[01:43:11.130 --> 01:43:20.090]  you know this is a little early but it's a safe time to go out um from here to you know june 15th
[01:43:20.650 --> 01:43:27.130]  um is a completely safe time today's may 15th we're recording just so that people have a reference
[01:43:27.930 --> 01:43:35.450]  um one thing to speak on on that is uh if you have your plants indoor say under a 24 hour
[01:43:35.450 --> 01:43:42.250]  light cycle and they're root bound and you put them outside right now they're gonna bloom um
[01:43:42.970 --> 01:43:49.610]  we only have about 15 hours of light right now and a lot of sativa plants that's plenty enough
[01:43:49.610 --> 01:43:57.290]  to trigger uh blooming coming from a stressed out 24 hour light cycle or 18 hour light cycle um
[01:44:00.330 --> 01:44:04.890]  he's totally right yeah he's trying to elaborate but he's also taking a chunk from a dab yeah but
[01:44:04.890 --> 01:44:08.250]  uh he's totally right if you're putting your plants that have been outdoors since january
[01:44:08.250 --> 01:44:11.770]  or inside since january they're in pots they're starting to get root band bound because you're
[01:44:11.770 --> 01:44:15.770]  putting it off you're just waiting to put them outside yeah uh once you reduce that flowering
[01:44:15.770 --> 01:44:19.530]  time and they're already stressed enough they will start to flower which is actually probably
[01:44:19.530 --> 01:44:27.370]  a good thing here in colorado yeah um you're gonna because unfortunately in july it's gonna
[01:44:27.370 --> 01:44:33.930]  come out of flower um and it's gonna go back into veg and and then it won't go back into flower
[01:44:33.930 --> 01:44:41.050]  till august so that can really mess some stuff up um this is the time of year for window sill plants
[01:44:41.370 --> 01:44:47.930]  normally growers advise against window plants but this is the time of year to you know it's safe to
[01:44:47.930 --> 01:44:54.330]  have that plant in the window getting used to the natural light cycle and everything okay um kind of
[01:44:54.330 --> 01:45:00.250]  milk it on and off maybe have a little t5 above it would a greenhouse be ideal about now um yeah
[01:45:00.250 --> 01:45:06.890]  yeah i mean as long as it's not stressed um you know nice fresh clone uh would uh be pretty safe
[01:45:06.970 --> 01:45:15.370]  in there and it's gonna go ahead and start vegging so that's um uh would a little bit of
[01:45:15.370 --> 01:45:21.370]  high nitrogen feeding slow down the bloom process to help prevent that yes okay yes most definitely
[01:45:21.370 --> 01:45:25.370]  i think so yeah yeah so if you guys don't overdo it but just uh when you put them out there feed a
[01:45:25.370 --> 01:45:30.010]  little extra nitrogen if you're doing it right now yeah and and a lot of root inoculations you
[01:45:30.010 --> 01:45:36.490]  can never go go wrong with a lot of root inoculants yeah and then you know uh larger containers is the
[01:45:36.490 --> 01:45:43.130]  best way to fix a root bound plant so you were uh we were talking before the show you said that uh
[01:45:43.130 --> 01:45:48.410]  the best way to do it is always to throw that plant into the dirt yeah if you get it into the
[01:45:48.410 --> 01:45:57.770]  earth that's the best way to go firm believer in uh attaching you know um when it's man i gotta
[01:45:57.770 --> 01:46:03.770]  think of a good way to explain this um i just i believe plants do better when they're attached
[01:46:03.770 --> 01:46:08.890]  to the earth and not in the container full of peat moss um not that that's a bad way to do it
[01:46:09.610 --> 01:46:16.330]  um i just think they're better in the earth okay that makes good sense uh organics are really hard
[01:46:16.330 --> 01:46:23.770]  to mess up um you know that's that's the easiest way to do organics and have stellar results in my
[01:46:23.770 --> 01:46:29.450]  opinion would you say uh and this may be some you said the word hippie dippy shit earlier so maybe
[01:46:29.450 --> 01:46:34.970]  that's what this is yes do you think uh is it the vibration of the earth is it that connectedness
[01:46:34.970 --> 01:46:40.490]  okay and i uh i i believe a lot in that sort of stuff in the growing i believe that that's part
[01:46:40.490 --> 01:46:44.890]  of why our growth stand out because we agree that the plant is and the earth and us and the
[01:46:44.890 --> 01:46:50.650]  atmosphere we all have this symbiotic relationship uh and i i learned a lot of that i had adopted
[01:46:50.650 --> 01:46:55.370]  this style before but then i learned a lot more of it from soma yeah if you guys are familiar with
[01:46:55.370 --> 01:47:01.130]  the old breeder soma if you're not do some reading on soma yes sir all right so we've gotten ourselves
[01:47:01.130 --> 01:47:07.690]  up to uh we're vegging outdoors we should uh rewind and talk about maybe uh having a secure garden
[01:47:07.690 --> 01:47:13.050]  and being having a legal garden that's up to you if you want to be legal in colorado we advise you
[01:47:13.050 --> 01:47:18.410]  to be legal you can have uh six plants as a medical patient you can have six plants as a
[01:47:18.410 --> 01:47:25.050]  civilian over the age of 21 i do believe that half of those need to be in flower and half of those
[01:47:25.050 --> 01:47:30.170]  need to be in veg so you can put three large plants outside as long as they are not accessible
[01:47:30.170 --> 01:47:39.050]  or visible to the general public and um okay amendment 20 says uh it amendment 20 is real
[01:47:39.050 --> 01:47:49.290]  open that's the medical bill um it needs to be a secured area um basically as i you know i can't
[01:47:49.370 --> 01:47:58.250]  recall perbatum but uh or perbatum but whatever that is um but amendment 64 does mention some
[01:47:58.250 --> 01:48:06.170]  stuff and it says a locked enclosed secured facility okay so depending on you know to me
[01:48:06.170 --> 01:48:12.410]  that says dog kennel yeah something just like that is what i was thinking too yeah or uh greenhouse
[01:48:12.410 --> 01:48:17.610]  yeah greenhouse would be perfect uh anything should if you've got locks on your gate chicken
[01:48:18.010 --> 01:48:22.410]  yeah or in your just backyard in general i think that should be enough yeah uh you did your you
[01:48:22.410 --> 01:48:31.130]  tried your best so um yeah three per adult at residence you know that's uh three plants is
[01:48:31.130 --> 01:48:35.850]  plenty enough to grow a person uh an ounce a week here in southern colorado yeah you said that
[01:48:35.850 --> 01:48:42.330]  earlier uh you could produce uh 52 ounces off of three large plants and that gives you an ounce a
[01:48:42.330 --> 01:48:48.410]  week yeah which would save i'm gonna do some fake math here uh i'm gonna go low i'm gonna guess that
[01:48:48.410 --> 01:48:55.130]  an ounce is about 300 bucks at a dispensary sure yeah medical medical medical so okay well no
[01:48:55.130 --> 01:49:01.130]  if i'm a wreck it's even more wreck let's say 400 for an hour wow so we're looking at 400 bucks
[01:49:01.130 --> 01:49:06.410]  times 52 i don't need a calculator to know that i'm gonna save a shit ton of money yes yes it's
[01:49:06.410 --> 01:49:14.570]  like switching to geico just by growing outdoors yep yep switching to geico there we go i fix the
[01:49:14.570 --> 01:49:18.650]  sound issue god okay yeah this piece right here needs to go we're gonna smash it with the hammer
[01:49:18.650 --> 01:49:23.930]  after the show the ballast home went away yeah yep the ballast home that's awesome i think that
[01:49:23.930 --> 01:49:28.730]  may have been why it took us uh a while to realize it growers yeah you just hear that hum
[01:49:30.170 --> 01:49:33.770]  i when i drew at home all the time i would wake up and not hear the hum and that's when you know
[01:49:33.770 --> 01:49:38.010]  something's wrong it's too quiet in here you gotta go run and look in the flower then you
[01:49:38.010 --> 01:49:44.970]  realize it's off okay yeah so um you know uh don't grow it in front of everyone don't rub it in
[01:49:44.970 --> 01:49:51.690]  anyone's face you know keep it in your backyard uh fenced secured if you live in pueblo just grow
[01:49:51.690 --> 01:49:56.890]  a bunch of weed yeah yeah what you have to worry about uh i've got security written down yeah
[01:49:57.930 --> 01:50:01.850]  thieves are your biggest problem here in pueblo other than the cops aren't even that big of a
[01:50:01.850 --> 01:50:07.130]  deal it's around here cops are cool in pueblo i've had a few run-ins with them this is cool
[01:50:07.130 --> 01:50:11.690]  this is a weird avenue for me to even go down but think about what you're bringing when you're
[01:50:11.690 --> 01:50:15.450]  setting up an outdoor garden if you do run into a thief if you do catch somebody out there
[01:50:16.250 --> 01:50:20.410]  think about what you're going to do before the time comes because everybody has a they've got
[01:50:20.410 --> 01:50:23.770]  big balls when they're thinking and talking but you're gonna have to deal with some shit if that
[01:50:23.770 --> 01:50:27.770]  does happen so think about what you're bringing i know that's a shitty avenue to go down set up
[01:50:27.770 --> 01:50:35.610]  some security cameras have a dog yeah dogs do wonders and um getting your stuff ripped off is a
[01:50:35.610 --> 01:50:43.850]  very humbling experience yeah and it also uh there's there's a few stages of it there's the
[01:50:43.850 --> 01:50:49.130]  denial it's not gone yeah and there's the fuck it's gone yeah and then who could it be everyone
[01:50:49.130 --> 01:50:55.370]  everyone it was everyone yeah and then it wasn't anyone yeah and then you find it on the somebody's
[01:50:55.370 --> 01:51:02.330]  selling you an eighth of it on the street and then you're just glad you tried uh so yeah that's a
[01:51:02.330 --> 01:51:06.010]  weird avenue to even mention but be prepared what you're going to do because somebody may attempt to
[01:51:06.010 --> 01:51:10.810]  steal your shit and please don't shoot them over marijuana grow more next year yeah uh human lives
[01:51:10.810 --> 01:51:15.050]  are worth way more than than marijuana yeah don't shoot anybody over your pot that's a crime that
[01:51:15.050 --> 01:51:19.770]  becomes a crime you're uh you're protecting your criminal enterprise at that point if yeah yeah so
[01:51:19.770 --> 01:51:22.970]  just let them have it if they're going to come steal it like that if you were if you're a fighter
[01:51:22.970 --> 01:51:26.250]  and they don't have a weapon and you're brave like that do that but don't pull out a firearm
[01:51:26.250 --> 01:51:32.570]  please not in the name of weed good good little dog good little barkers yep two little chihuahuas
[01:51:32.570 --> 01:51:37.290]  that'll let you know who's there yep shout out to honey what's up honey if you're listening
[01:51:38.570 --> 01:51:45.530]  yappy little fucker so uh we should back up once more into soil prep uh we've got nice big 12 inch
[01:51:45.530 --> 01:51:50.090]  tall plants they've been 18 inch tall plants they've got stalks bigger than my middle finger
[01:51:50.090 --> 01:51:54.970]  uh they've been topped uh nothing need to go into the dirt we should prep the soil you got
[01:51:54.970 --> 01:51:59.770]  a dig of nice size hole we should prep some soil to put in there right yeah all right what do you
[01:51:59.770 --> 01:52:06.730]  what do you like to add to your outdoor mix um i organic um jesse's all about the organics he's a
[01:52:06.730 --> 01:52:15.290]  hippie in disguise i make my own compost uh slash worm casting kind of combined thing um and uh
[01:52:16.250 --> 01:52:25.210]  lots of bone meal lots of blood meal uh fish bone meal um azomite lime uh kelp mill
[01:52:26.090 --> 01:52:33.290]  um rock phosphate worm castings i said that guanos lots of guanos lots of guanos
[01:52:34.250 --> 01:52:40.970]  um i don't know to me that's all basic stuff but that sounds like a lot of stuff um that's all in
[01:52:40.970 --> 01:52:47.050]  very small dosages of each piece right um for beginners the guanos you'll kind of beef up on
[01:52:48.010 --> 01:52:52.890]  the fish meal blood meal bone meal you can go heavy on yeah yeah the other stuff just you can
[01:52:52.890 --> 01:53:00.090]  try lightly and you'll still have a good product for sure okay um do not use anything from like
[01:53:00.090 --> 01:53:06.250]  home depot don't get anything with scott's or miracle grow on it uh don't do that no no it'll
[01:53:06.250 --> 01:53:11.690]  taste like shit uh it'll burn your plants and don't support that shit anyway yeah don't don't
[01:53:11.690 --> 01:53:16.330]  put that in our earth right yeah if you're growing your own cannabis you want better products going
[01:53:16.330 --> 01:53:20.570]  into your what you're putting in you're going to smoke so try to stay as close to natural and as
[01:53:20.570 --> 01:53:25.370]  friendly with the earth as you can think about the impact you're leaving on i know it's your backyard
[01:53:25.370 --> 01:53:29.850]  it's your patch of dirt but hopefully you're going to grow there next year and next year and next year
[01:53:29.850 --> 01:53:33.210]  and then one day maybe your kids are going to grow there or somebody's kids are going to grow there so
[01:53:33.210 --> 01:53:38.810]  be conscious of what you're doing to our earth please yeah that's cool to hear that yeah we got
[01:53:38.810 --> 01:53:44.570]  to remind them yeah and and like you said that's your patch of earth so you know that means those
[01:53:44.570 --> 01:53:52.650]  words mean a lot to me hey man that's that's yeah um so your kids earth one day so ideally you would
[01:53:52.650 --> 01:53:57.930]  uh mix your soil earlier you know nice warm day in march or something like that or in april
[01:53:58.810 --> 01:54:05.690]  put it in the ground water it good cover it with plastic um turn it a couple times that just helps
[01:54:06.970 --> 01:54:13.050]  kind of activate everything it's called uh lots of different slang words for it yeah you know
[01:54:13.050 --> 01:54:20.090]  cooking your soil brewing your soil whatever if you see a white webbing stuff on there excellent
[01:54:20.090 --> 01:54:25.130]  that's a good thing don't freak out don't don't panic that's awesome that is life happening in
[01:54:25.130 --> 01:54:28.490]  your soil and that life is going to transfer right into your plants and your plants are going
[01:54:28.490 --> 01:54:36.730]  to have a big life orgasm in there yes but if you didn't do that don't freak out that's you know
[01:54:36.730 --> 01:54:43.610]  it that doesn't ruin anything if you're you know just hearing this uh it's you know you're still
[01:54:43.610 --> 01:54:49.290]  fine to you know mix your soil uh you know pretty much follow the directions on the back of the boxes
[01:54:49.610 --> 01:54:58.890]  um you know uh uh bugs should we have done anything by now for bugs or animals or pests
[01:54:58.890 --> 01:55:02.650]  or anything outdoors see i'm an indoor guy so a lot i'm learning with you on this or i'm learning
[01:55:02.650 --> 01:55:07.850]  with the listeners on this outdoor lesson it's my opinion here in colorado there are more good
[01:55:07.850 --> 01:55:17.610]  bugs outside than there are bad bugs um pesticides outside um i've never used them okay so in my in
[01:55:17.610 --> 01:55:23.050]  my ideal world whatever is eating my plant today tomorrow something is going to come to eat that
[01:55:23.050 --> 01:55:28.250]  critter yes and if that gets out of control tomorrow will somebody will eat that and hopefully
[01:55:28.250 --> 01:55:33.210]  mother nature and the eco will balance me out that yeah okay and that's why organics are so important
[01:55:33.210 --> 01:55:39.130]  outdoors um you know when when you dump salts and stuff like that into the earth it kills it and
[01:55:39.930 --> 01:55:44.890]  it kills the beetles and it kills the bugs and which kills the birds which kills the bees
[01:55:45.690 --> 01:55:49.530]  when he says salts he's talking about uh bottled nutrients almost everything we're buying in a
[01:55:49.530 --> 01:55:56.650]  bottle yeah be it veganic or organic it's a salt-based nutrient yeah yeah yeah chelated yes
[01:55:56.650 --> 01:56:03.610]  uh which mostly just kills all your micros anyway so now we've got healthy fat soil rich soil uh
[01:56:03.610 --> 01:56:08.170]  we got some tall plants in there they're topped they're starting to grow uh those are going to
[01:56:08.170 --> 01:56:11.690]  get out of hand bro because we just topped them like 50 times they got a bunch of heads how do
[01:56:11.690 --> 01:56:17.770]  we uh keep that under control um well uh you can take uh like some four by four metal fencing
[01:56:17.770 --> 01:56:28.650]  hog fencing i think it's commonly referred to um make a 36 48 inch uh wide uh a super tomato
[01:56:28.650 --> 01:56:37.610]  cage basically okay um fasten it to the ground um and you're able to pull the plant down um
[01:56:38.410 --> 01:56:43.610]  and redirect the growth um so you want to spread it out just like you would indoors to kind of get
[01:56:43.610 --> 01:56:48.250]  the light down the sun down in there yeah okay um you're able to make the plant bigger
[01:56:49.290 --> 01:56:55.690]  um it's also a good security device oh there you go theft deterrent yes very very much that's gonna
[01:56:55.690 --> 01:57:01.850]  make uh maybe tie a bell or two to that cage oh yeah yeah okay seeing that thinking that wakes up
[01:57:02.250 --> 01:57:07.850]  your little chihuahua yeah so lets you run out there and rescue the crop hopefully you're just
[01:57:07.850 --> 01:57:13.050]  scaring away some punks nobody tough yeah all right so i'm picturing like this big cylinder
[01:57:13.050 --> 01:57:18.010]  of tomato caging essentially it looks like maybe like my plants in a cage and i'm gonna put that
[01:57:18.010 --> 01:57:22.410]  on early enough to where my plant has i don't have to struggle to get my plant into that right yeah
[01:57:22.410 --> 01:57:26.650]  yeah so 36 to 48 inches you guys that's three to four feet around that's what we're planning
[01:57:26.650 --> 01:57:33.210]  on this little tiny 18 inch plant turning into uh how tall do i need that my cage um five six foot
[01:57:33.210 --> 01:57:39.850]  okay you know all right most privacy foot six foot so um unfortunately i've always grown behind
[01:57:39.850 --> 01:57:46.730]  privacy fence make it six inches shorter than the fence yeah all right and you know let's keep it
[01:57:46.730 --> 01:57:53.130]  yeah keep her down so your uh your nodes uh the arms of the plant are gonna grow up basically
[01:57:53.130 --> 01:57:57.210]  and you're gonna want to grab one of those and weave it through that tomato cage toward the
[01:57:57.210 --> 01:58:02.170]  outside looks like it's got just a bunch of arms poking out okay yeah yeah okay and then those will
[01:58:02.170 --> 01:58:05.690]  be strong enough to hold themselves up because they've been outdoors but i'm not gonna need to
[01:58:05.690 --> 01:58:12.490]  stake them after that hopefully yeah um another thing is uh um a good thing to hook this cage to
[01:58:12.490 --> 01:58:20.650]  is like a a wooden frame made out like four by fours um that also helps hold the water in for
[01:58:20.650 --> 01:58:26.010]  the plant so you can water it proper amounts and everything okay so like a slightly raised bed yeah
[01:58:26.010 --> 01:58:32.490]  slightly basically a little micro bed um you know and a depression in the ground there uh these
[01:58:32.490 --> 01:58:38.490]  these plants will use up to five gallons of water a day easily wow even more so keep that in mind
[01:58:38.490 --> 01:58:41.930]  you guys for these plants that we're planting if you're doing three of them to stay legal you need
[01:58:41.930 --> 01:58:46.010]  15 gallons of water a day so you're gonna have to think about how you're gonna get that water there
[01:58:46.010 --> 01:58:50.890]  if you're doing it somewhere that's that's by the time they're blooming easily that's that's the
[01:58:50.890 --> 01:58:55.850]  biggest thing uh outdoors is keep those guys watered yes yeah i don't water water water lots
[01:58:55.850 --> 01:59:03.850]  of water it's really really hard to over water uh in southern colorado soil really hard for marijuana
[01:59:03.850 --> 01:59:08.970]  especially in the outdoor sun we get here do you think the uh this is random do you think the
[01:59:08.970 --> 01:59:13.530]  difference we get in the uh heat during the day and the cold at night plays a big difference in
[01:59:13.530 --> 01:59:18.170]  the flavor and potency of our cannabis yes i agree uh we get a lot of tasty fruit the cantaloupes
[01:59:18.170 --> 01:59:23.290]  and the peaches are delicious and i think it has something to do with that cold sour d loves it
[01:59:23.290 --> 01:59:28.730]  really well don't tell everybody that what huh dude if they've got a good sour d cut let's help
[01:59:28.730 --> 01:59:33.050]  them out if they're growing that sour d send a note don't send anything when you see me share me
[01:59:33.050 --> 01:59:37.370]  yeah if you know that if you have one of those hard to find ones they really love it there's a
[01:59:37.370 --> 01:59:41.850]  guy around here with a cut that's just fire yeah all right so we've got them are we gonna have to
[01:59:41.850 --> 01:59:46.490]  do any more pruning do you want to indoors i cut off all that bottom shit we do lollipopping do
[01:59:46.490 --> 01:59:51.370]  you want to do that as much on an outdoor crop for sure um i like to hollow the plants out basically
[01:59:51.370 --> 01:59:57.930]  like they do the fruit trees over in palisade um say your plant's four foot in circumference uh
[01:59:58.570 --> 02:00:06.890]  everything you know this is totally situational but you know just approximately you know 12 to
[02:00:07.690 --> 02:00:14.490]  18 inches of uh plant length everything man hold on i think i see what you're saying yeah
[02:00:15.130 --> 02:00:20.410]  you're probably gonna have to edit this part okay so uh you know from the uh
[02:00:21.370 --> 02:00:27.530]  um from the outside in you know every you know about 18 inches you just want to pretty much
[02:00:27.530 --> 02:00:34.090]  strip everything off the main branches okay you know that isn't a branch itself um keep them nice
[02:00:34.090 --> 02:00:39.130]  and hollow that helps airflow in there lots of airflow we were talking about molds earlier
[02:00:39.130 --> 02:00:44.810]  bug deterrence bug deterrence you don't want moldy weed we do we do have caterpillar caterpillar
[02:00:44.810 --> 02:00:49.930]  issues here so what are those orange things we get here they're these little orange worms i've only
[02:00:49.930 --> 02:00:55.290]  only happens around here um i've seen them brown and yellow i've never seen okay orange ones but
[02:00:55.290 --> 02:01:01.370]  yeah yeah they totally uh they're from moths okay spruce moth there you go that makes good sense to
[02:01:01.370 --> 02:01:07.370]  me and that's their larvae and their their parents were way hippie and decided to lay their kids a
[02:01:07.370 --> 02:01:14.890]  bunch of pot plants and it actually happens uh early in uh the bud development and you don't
[02:01:14.890 --> 02:01:19.610]  really notice it till about harvest time yeah that's what sucks you don't find it till harvest
[02:01:19.610 --> 02:01:24.250]  and please if you do find shit like that don't make hash at him yeah so just just cut it out that
[02:01:24.250 --> 02:01:32.010]  bud i've never you know you know discard that bud um it's it doesn't affect the entire plant it
[02:01:32.010 --> 02:01:38.250]  just affects the area around the bug itself so that's one of the few uh pests that is
[02:01:38.810 --> 02:01:43.690]  doesn't ruin the entire plant uh that's another good question what are some of my pitfalls going
[02:01:43.690 --> 02:01:49.050]  to be growing outdoors in colorado um if you don't have good air circulation in the fall you're going
[02:01:49.050 --> 02:01:55.770]  to get powdery mold um make sure you don't over plant your area and you have plenty of air
[02:01:55.770 --> 02:02:01.770]  circulation around your plant uh you should be fine um you know if you planted in the forefoot
[02:02:01.770 --> 02:02:07.210]  area between your shed and your back fence and your side fence and there's a bush growing on the
[02:02:07.210 --> 02:02:11.610]  side and you threw a tarp over the top so the neighbors in the second story building couldn't
[02:02:11.610 --> 02:02:17.530]  see you you're probably going to get mold just just like growing indoors with that aspect but
[02:02:17.530 --> 02:02:25.450]  you know plenty air flow uh let mother nature do her thing um spider mites i have seen outdoors
[02:02:25.450 --> 02:02:32.170]  here um it's really hard to get that's mostly from sloppy indoor grows so just carrying them
[02:02:32.170 --> 02:02:37.210]  out there yeah yeah you should be taking care of that inside anyway yeah um and those will
[02:02:37.210 --> 02:02:42.250]  ruin your plants absolutely powdery mold and you want to talk about sad people
[02:02:42.410 --> 02:02:47.850]  it's one thing to throw away an indoor plant because it had one of those things throw away
[02:02:47.850 --> 02:02:52.970]  an entire outdoor plant is yeah we're hoping to grow 52 ounces here with these three outdoor
[02:02:52.970 --> 02:02:57.690]  plants so uh i've only got a couple more questions for you i know we're uh gonna try to we're gonna
[02:02:57.690 --> 02:03:01.050]  try to do segments we're gonna have them back in a couple of weeks and we'll have jesse back in a
[02:03:01.050 --> 02:03:03.930]  couple weeks and then we'll have him back in a couple weeks after that and hopefully it'll be
[02:03:03.930 --> 02:03:08.090]  harvest time and uh he'll bring some of his outdoor harvest with him to share with us and
[02:03:08.250 --> 02:03:12.250]  with them to share with us and talk about and you guys can yeah we'll all talk shop on the show
[02:03:13.210 --> 02:03:19.610]  what day around when am i going to go into flower outdoors here in colorado this year um
[02:03:20.650 --> 02:03:29.130]  july 15th around then okay the hours will start going negative uh the the hours in the day will
[02:03:29.130 --> 02:03:34.490]  start getting shorter okay um up until then they're gonna start getting longer so cannabis
[02:03:34.490 --> 02:03:40.250]  only needs about 14 hours of daylight to make it start flowering outdoors uh when the sun sets
[02:03:40.250 --> 02:03:44.330]  this is some trip shit yeah and i may get this wrong when the sun sets it starts putting off a
[02:03:44.330 --> 02:03:48.810]  red spectrum and that red spectrum triggers the hormones in the plant to sleep so it kind of tucks
[02:03:48.810 --> 02:03:53.690]  it in a lot of people talk about well it's not 12 12 outside why am i flowering it's that red
[02:03:53.690 --> 02:03:57.610]  spectrum in the sun it's kind of messing that's not messing it's doing exactly what it should do
[02:03:57.610 --> 02:04:02.490]  it's telling your plants night and in the morning it's blue and that wakes them up i've heard i've
[02:04:02.490 --> 02:04:10.010]  read in a old dj short book or no anyways i know gj short is where i heard this um uh it's only
[02:04:10.010 --> 02:04:16.090]  about an hour hour and a half that makes these plants flower outside versus indoors it's anywhere
[02:04:16.090 --> 02:04:23.290]  from 12 to uh six hours difference of light that makes them flower so it's the that equatorial
[02:04:23.290 --> 02:04:29.050]  stuff uh if you're coming from thailand and places like that or more jungly regions and and outdoors
[02:04:30.010 --> 02:04:38.730]  um different strains will flower at different times so uh your sativas go first um i've noticed
[02:04:38.730 --> 02:04:46.490]  your landrace plants will go first too uh hybrids typically go last so okay yeah yes when is my
[02:04:46.490 --> 02:04:53.050]  when should i really be focused on getting these things down by uh as far as harvesting yeah what's
[02:04:53.050 --> 02:04:57.530]  my harvest date what's my deadline um do i just sit outside and watch for that first frost and
[02:04:58.090 --> 02:05:05.610]  three hours before it freezes the first time no uh that's really hard to say um you know when
[02:05:05.610 --> 02:05:12.170]  they're done right yeah but by the end of september it's not gonna freeze and most plants are acceptable
[02:05:12.170 --> 02:05:18.970]  to harvest so safe safe to take down okay uh you were talking about strain selection uh without
[02:05:18.970 --> 02:05:22.890]  giving me any shameless plugs i mean i'm sure i know i do know that a couple of my strains work
[02:05:22.890 --> 02:05:28.730]  quite well outside but what kind of stuff would work well for the colorado region around us and
[02:05:28.730 --> 02:05:32.410]  if you know any of the popular cuts that people have got i know golden goat is a good outdoor but
[02:05:32.410 --> 02:05:37.450]  it takes a minute to finish you got to be patient with that girl what else would you throw outside
[02:05:37.450 --> 02:05:44.970]  um like i i suspect heart of gold would kill um anything with kim dog roots does excellent okay
[02:05:45.530 --> 02:05:50.650]  so put some grateful dog heart of gold bounty killer outside would probably be amazing um
[02:05:51.210 --> 02:05:55.850]  flow does really good uh flow and blueberry honestly are two of the best performing outdoor
[02:05:55.850 --> 02:05:59.690]  plants i've i've never done my own outdoor but i have helped a couple of guys and the flow and
[02:05:59.690 --> 02:06:05.210]  the blueberry always blew my mind when he did them outdoor uh ghost boba does really good outside
[02:06:05.210 --> 02:06:10.090]  okay that's a good strain too uh doesn't yield good but she tastes amazing outside
[02:06:12.730 --> 02:06:17.610]  uh golden goats good um sour diesel actually does pretty good around here um
[02:06:18.330 --> 02:06:22.890]  some guys in a little town yeah outside of here that man they kill that outdoor sour d
[02:06:22.890 --> 02:06:28.010]  shout out guys i'm not gonna bust your spot but shout out lemon cheese short bus p but
[02:06:29.370 --> 02:06:34.650]  short bus huh colorado green bud no those are all local strains i'm gonna pack a short bus
[02:06:34.650 --> 02:06:38.570]  that somebody handed me at the first uh cannabis cup that's from that same little town
[02:06:38.570 --> 02:06:44.570]  neat yeah they just walked by and planted them on me kept going wow yeah um want to fight
[02:06:48.250 --> 02:06:56.170]  uh if you've got some room bro if you have got some room um locally bred strains always do
[02:06:57.050 --> 02:07:03.930]  better if they were bred here um plain and simple yeah i don't know why but they do that's their
[02:07:03.930 --> 02:07:09.770]  environment that makes sense to me so um yeah i had one more question but i can't think of it
[02:07:09.770 --> 02:07:13.610]  off the top of my head so we'll save it for next time okay that was right in 30 minutes bro so if
[02:07:13.610 --> 02:07:18.250]  you got any uh couple ending things to end on we can save the rest for next time or um pest
[02:07:19.290 --> 02:07:25.610]  pesticides if you do use them please use like neem oil um organic ones don't don't kill the bees
[02:07:26.570 --> 02:07:34.730]  uh um feed with teas but yeah we'll get to that next time there we go i'll make a note to talk
[02:07:34.730 --> 02:07:42.410]  about teas um and security don't tell anyone that doesn't need to know even if it is even
[02:07:42.410 --> 02:07:46.570]  if you're in a legal state don't tell anyone that doesn't need to know that'll be your first
[02:07:46.570 --> 02:07:50.810]  suspect when it gets stolen and then that's gonna fuck up friendships yeah and more likely that
[02:07:50.810 --> 02:07:57.610]  person didn't do it but it's really hard not to think they did that's great shit uh one thing i
[02:07:57.610 --> 02:08:02.490]  was gonna mention if you're gonna get some stuff tested uh well you can't get stuff tested they
[02:08:02.490 --> 02:08:07.370]  just changed the rules here in colorado uh if you were able to get stuff tested do you think the
[02:08:07.370 --> 02:08:12.730]  outdoor stuff is going to test considerably higher than the indoor stuff i would like to see
[02:08:12.730 --> 02:08:18.730]  that uh indoor i suspect is probably going to have higher thc uh simply because it doesn't have the
[02:08:18.730 --> 02:08:25.050]  dust and the wind and the rain on it um i think the sun outnumbers all of that in my opinion so
[02:08:25.050 --> 02:08:28.570]  we should uh we should grow the same strain indoors and out and see what we can do for sure
[02:08:28.570 --> 02:08:35.210]  no what i do think will happen outdoors is you're going to have a lot of these other cannabinoids
[02:08:35.210 --> 02:08:41.130]  are going to be off the charts okay so that's my theory so our grow lights are only bringing
[02:08:41.130 --> 02:08:46.570]  out specific yeah yeah is that why we're getting so much lemonade and things i yeah i wonder yeah
[02:08:46.570 --> 02:08:50.970]  um here's something i've never shared if you want more lemon flavor i've never i don't think i've
[02:08:50.970 --> 02:08:55.290]  told anybody this i read it uh in something i think it was steep hill or something like that
[02:08:55.290 --> 02:08:59.930]  long time ago if you want more lemon flavor lemonade can be increased it's almost a stress
[02:08:59.930 --> 02:09:04.650]  reaction by making too much light and too much heat on the tops of your plants that'll increase
[02:09:04.650 --> 02:09:10.410]  your lemonade and lemony limey kind of flavor i guess safety reaction i think so yeah yeah
[02:09:11.610 --> 02:09:15.530]  all right uh that's just over 30 minutes i'll put a couple of ads and some more stuff onto the here
[02:09:15.530 --> 02:09:21.770]  uh you got any plugs or anything yeah sure jesse grows on instagram all one word um and garden
[02:09:21.770 --> 02:09:28.890]  oweedon on instagram um yeah i don't know it's spelled weird i'll i'll tag them on on our
[02:09:28.890 --> 02:09:34.650]  instagram page so they can find us so uh yeah yeah that's about it cool uh jesse will be back

[02:10:02.900 --> 02:10:06.740]  show where i take a minute to give thanks to somebody i feel has been beneficial or crucial
[02:10:06.740 --> 02:10:11.700]  to the cannabis movement the past two episodes i've given thanks to jorge cervantes and ed
[02:10:11.700 --> 02:10:17.060]  rosenthal because they were very important in my my development and my education as a cannabis
[02:10:17.060 --> 02:10:23.220]  grower so i want to continue that uh that series and give thanks to robert connell clark robert
[02:10:23.220 --> 02:10:27.620]  connell clark is a native-born californian he wrote and illustrated the botany and ecology of
[02:10:27.620 --> 02:10:32.580]  cannabis as his undergraduate thesis at university of california at santa cruz where he graduated
[02:10:32.660 --> 02:10:39.220]  with honors he later self-published his thesis and started pods pressed in ben lemon california
[02:10:39.220 --> 02:10:43.140]  clark has published articles in high times magazine and other journals on his favorite subject
[02:10:43.700 --> 02:10:47.620]  as a well-known cannabis photographer his photos and illustrations have appeared in numerous
[02:10:47.620 --> 02:10:52.660]  magazines books posters and calendars clark continues to travel throughout the west interviewing
[02:10:52.660 --> 02:10:57.620]  cultivators and fellow researchers clark carries an active correspondence with the major cannabis
[02:10:57.620 --> 02:11:01.780]  researchers throughout the world and this is reflected in the in-depth and accuracy of his
[02:11:01.780 --> 02:11:08.340]  writings on cannabis robert connell clark is responsible for a lot of my breeding knowledge
[02:11:09.460 --> 02:11:14.260]  uh he wrote he wrote a book called marijuana botany he also wrote cannabis evolution and
[02:11:14.260 --> 02:11:20.020]  ethno botany and he also wrote the book called hashish which also has a updated version
[02:11:20.820 --> 02:11:26.660]  the book marijuana botany uh every grower that's trying to reach the next level should read this
[02:11:26.660 --> 02:11:30.820]  book and if you're thinking about breeding this is the book to get this is basically an instruction
[02:11:30.820 --> 02:11:36.580]  book on how to breed high-grade cannabis and to hit the goals you're looking for so i just want to
[02:11:36.580 --> 02:11:41.460]  take a moment and say thank you robert connell clark you've been very uh crucial and instrumental
[02:11:41.460 --> 02:11:46.340]  in my cannabis education and i wouldn't be the breeder that i am without you so big thanks robert

[02:13:46.350 --> 02:13:51.230]  here in colorado coming to you guys with the promised dab episode but before we do that
[02:13:51.230 --> 02:13:56.430]  i want to read a little bit of news a few episodes ago i told you guys about the colorado symphony
[02:13:56.430 --> 02:14:00.750]  inviting folks to bring cannabis to their concerts well the concerts have since happened
[02:14:00.750 --> 02:14:04.270]  and i've got a little article here from the denver post written by john wenzel
[02:14:04.830 --> 02:14:12.190]  uh the headline is symphony's first cannabis concert woos and raises funds the colorado
[02:14:12.190 --> 02:14:17.230]  symphony orchestra's first classically cannabis event began friday night like any other fine arts
[02:14:17.230 --> 02:14:21.710]  fundraiser with suit and dress wearing attendees politely mingling in a high-ceilinged art gallery
[02:14:21.710 --> 02:14:28.110]  sipping drinks and shaking hands no clouds of pot smoke no tie-dyed t-shirts not at first anyway
[02:14:28.110 --> 02:14:32.270]  a closer look revealed the distinctly cannabis related nature of the event
[02:14:32.270 --> 02:14:35.950]  the first of three fundraisers in which invite only attendees were encouraged to bring their
[02:14:35.950 --> 02:14:40.590]  own marijuana friday's classically cannabis event also featured a patio on which attendees
[02:14:40.590 --> 02:14:46.430]  casually smoked pot from joints vaporizers pens and glass pipes under umbrellas as a light rain
[02:14:46.430 --> 02:14:51.150]  fell the back of the space gallery on santa fe drive which was covered with an l-shaped lofted
[02:14:51.150 --> 02:14:55.950]  area that supported a half dozen more small tables also featured vendors from dispensaries
[02:14:55.950 --> 02:15:01.230]  and pot shops that sponsored the event such as wellspring gaya and boulders the farm as the night
[02:15:01.230 --> 02:15:06.830]  wore on the sticky sweet smell of marijuana wafted in regularly from the wide garage door that opened
[02:15:06.830 --> 02:15:11.630]  into the patio which led to another small outdoor area with food trucks and a pair of ice cream and
[02:15:11.630 --> 02:15:16.670]  popsicle vendors where attendees also openly smoked cannabis we're bridging the gap between
[02:15:16.670 --> 02:15:22.590]  classical music and marijuana in both directions said morgan car co-owner co-owner of wellspring
[02:15:22.590 --> 02:15:27.230]  as he showed off the complimentary vaporizer pens pre-loaded with hash oil and wellspring
[02:15:27.230 --> 02:15:32.350]  branded glass jars and disposable lighters the event which was switched from public to private
[02:15:32.350 --> 02:15:37.710]  after the city of denver warned the cso about the illegality of public marijuana consumption
[02:15:37.710 --> 02:15:42.190]  has garnered international attention and speculation since it was announced the 250
[02:15:42.190 --> 02:15:47.870]  or so attendees shelled out at least 75 per person to support the cso's experiment and culture
[02:15:48.830 --> 02:15:55.070]  i'm going to kind of take a second right here that sucks uh these guys had to change their
[02:15:55.070 --> 02:16:00.670]  their idea from a public come smoke marijuana with us to make it a private event uh these little gray
[02:16:00.670 --> 02:16:04.350]  areas are bullshit we need to learn how to get it together so we can all consume cannabis safely
[02:16:04.350 --> 02:16:10.110]  together anyway look around this is not stoner town said evan lasky executive vice president of
[02:16:10.110 --> 02:16:15.630]  the cso who characterized the series as just another design to tap into new donors we have
[02:16:15.950 --> 02:16:20.590]  to build new audiences because the older people are dying off we have to fight this perception
[02:16:20.590 --> 02:16:26.830]  of elitism the cso brass quintet dressed in all black suits with pale green ties began its 45
[02:16:26.830 --> 02:16:32.750]  minute performance with richard strass ominous also sprocke xerathustra fanfare followed by
[02:16:32.750 --> 02:16:37.630]  short speeches from the cso and sponsors the acoustics in the unadorned space were sharp and
[02:16:37.630 --> 02:16:42.830]  bright as the quintet continued with recognizable classic favorites the chatter of side conversations
[02:16:42.830 --> 02:16:47.630]  from attendees who stood or milled about due to the casual non-seated setup nearly rivaled the
[02:16:47.630 --> 02:16:53.870]  quintet's volume at times compared to the average red rock show it was a state affair but as unlikely
[02:16:53.870 --> 02:16:59.630]  any sponsored official classic music event with a city organization has ever attracted so so much
[02:16:59.630 --> 02:17:04.510]  open marijuana consumption or contended with so much weed smoke hanging in the humid air
[02:17:04.510 --> 02:17:09.870]  co-organizer jane west of cannabis company edible events said thirty thousand dollars had already
[02:17:09.870 --> 02:17:14.590]  been secured in sponsorship for the night and cso officials confirmed another twenty thousand
[02:17:14.590 --> 02:17:19.390]  dollars was garnered from attendees the cso is hoping to raise two hundred thousand dollars from
[02:17:19.390 --> 02:17:24.190]  the three space gallery shows and another non-pot sanctioned classically cannabis event at red rocks
[02:17:24.190 --> 02:17:30.430]  this summer there didn't used to be any events i felt welcomed at said west but after legalization
[02:17:30.430 --> 02:17:35.870]  happened we wanted to start putting on events that we would actually go to for their part the cso
[02:17:35.870 --> 02:17:41.070]  musicians treated it just like another gig even as the smell of weed began wafting to the opposite
[02:17:41.070 --> 02:17:45.630]  side of the gallery where they warmed up in a private room we love playing chamber music wherever
[02:17:45.630 --> 02:17:51.310]  said trump trombone player greg harper it is what it is we're just going to play the pieces we know
[02:17:51.310 --> 02:17:56.510]  and hopefully people will appreciate it well it sounds like a lot of people appreciated it there
[02:17:56.510 --> 02:18:00.670]  were plenty of people in attendance and a lot of money was made so why can't this be an example
[02:18:01.230 --> 02:18:05.390]  uh there were no negative events there were no fights there were no crimes committed here
[02:18:05.470 --> 02:18:09.950]  was a great great event uh why can't we do this at red rocks why can't they say
[02:18:10.910 --> 02:18:15.790]  uh symphony at red rocks why can't they say reggae show at red rocks why can't they say any concert at
[02:18:15.790 --> 02:18:19.950]  red rocks bring a joint have a good time we don't care that you're smoking cannabis all it's going
[02:18:19.950 --> 02:18:24.350]  to do is make you hungrier and thirstier and make you enjoy the show more that's going to benefit
[02:18:24.350 --> 02:18:28.110]  everybody at red rocks they're going to sell more food they're going to sell more drinks the people
[02:18:28.110 --> 02:18:32.350]  they're going to enjoy the concert more i don't see a problem with smoking a little bit of cannabis
[02:18:32.350 --> 02:18:37.950]  it's legal and it creates commerce stoner commerce munchie commerce if you will all right
[02:18:37.950 --> 02:18:42.030]  i'm gonna find the next news article here we go i just want to read a little bit of news so we can
[02:18:42.030 --> 02:18:46.830]  hurry up and get into the dab section all right our next article comes out of canyon city and the
[02:18:46.830 --> 02:18:53.150]  headline is potheads against potholes hit streets for march in canyon city the article is by carrie
[02:18:53.150 --> 02:18:59.310]  canterbury from the canyon city daily record about 50 citizens took part in a march down main street
[02:18:59.310 --> 02:19:04.190]  just before monday's regular city council meeting to voice support for retail marijuana in canyon
[02:19:04.190 --> 02:19:10.350]  city uh if you guys don't know where canyon city is that's a little bit west of pueblo a little bit
[02:19:10.350 --> 02:19:17.310]  west of pueblo west actually probably 40 30 40 minutes outside of pueblo um it's a gorgeous
[02:19:17.310 --> 02:19:20.910]  little town there's a lot of great stuff out there i've got a lot of great friends out there
[02:19:20.910 --> 02:19:25.710]  that are in the uh rafting business so what's up guys giving you a shout out go visit canyon city
[02:19:25.710 --> 02:19:31.550]  see what's out there anyway fremont cannabis owner and event organizer dana sue said the group potheads
[02:19:31.550 --> 02:19:35.550]  against potholes also hosted a cookout complete with volleyball and other entertainment at the
[02:19:35.550 --> 02:19:41.150]  formal canyon floral building at 111 main street before the march she said about 100 people attended
[02:19:41.150 --> 02:19:47.150]  the cookout ranging in age from the early 20s to the 80s not the 80s their 80s they weren't from
[02:19:47.150 --> 02:19:52.830]  the 80s they're in their 80s the response was way more positive than negative sue said we were kind
[02:19:52.830 --> 02:19:56.830]  of surprised we weren't sure how people were going to feel about it we got a lot of honks and
[02:19:56.830 --> 02:20:00.990]  people screaming and waving the group ended the march at city hall where participants sat in on
[02:20:00.990 --> 02:20:04.750]  the city council meeting sue said they wanted to show the council that there are supporters for
[02:20:04.750 --> 02:20:09.550]  retail marijuana in the community the last meeting was in the middle of the day and it's kind of hard
[02:20:09.550 --> 02:20:14.670]  for people who work to get there she said city council members kevin ditmore colby kachmar and
[02:20:14.670 --> 02:20:19.550]  dennis wide walked with the group for part of the march i'm glad to see that there are some pro retail
[02:20:19.550 --> 02:20:24.110]  marijuana people starting to show up for some of our events wide said we've made no secret about it
[02:20:24.110 --> 02:20:28.590]  that i certainly am in favor of it i think it's ridiculous for us to turn over control of retail
[02:20:28.590 --> 02:20:33.150]  marijuana to our neighboring cities pueblo west and salida i think we should be the ones who
[02:20:33.150 --> 02:20:37.870]  control what goes on here the general government committee on may 7th by majority agreement elected
[02:20:37.870 --> 02:20:42.270]  to extend the moratorium beyond the november election to allow a vote on the matter and set
[02:20:42.270 --> 02:20:47.710]  the question to be asked on the november 4th ballot the current moratorium expires july 1st
[02:20:48.590 --> 02:20:52.990]  the ordinances are expected to be presented to council for first reading during the june 2nd
[02:20:52.990 --> 02:20:57.710]  meeting and if approved second reading and adoption would be during the june 16th meeting
[02:20:58.270 --> 02:21:02.510]  city administrator doug dotson said the first ordinance would extend the moratorium and would
[02:21:02.510 --> 02:21:07.870]  set question on on the ballot for public vote the second ordinance would ask if the first one
[02:21:07.870 --> 02:21:12.910]  approved if there should be additional sales or excise tax on the sale of retail marijuana
[02:21:13.470 --> 02:21:17.870]  so i want to highly advise them to vote against that because when we legalize recreational cannabis
[02:21:17.870 --> 02:21:23.710]  here in pueblo in the county when the shops opened up they are required to charge 25 tax
[02:21:24.590 --> 02:21:32.190]  on anything so if you buy a hundred dollar bag it's now 125 dollar bag so vote that down if you
[02:21:32.190 --> 02:21:37.310]  get the option now let's get back into the article during monday's meeting mayor tony
[02:21:37.310 --> 02:21:41.870]  grier said there's a rumor circulating that there is a conspiracy for ketchmar to recuse himself
[02:21:41.870 --> 02:21:46.590]  from voting on the retail marijuana issue specifically so that grier can vote in favor
[02:21:46.590 --> 02:21:51.470]  grier said that is not true i have not made up my mind on that grier said that is why we have
[02:21:51.470 --> 02:21:56.110]  public hearing when clarifying the may 7 meeting minutes ketchmar said during that meeting he
[02:21:56.110 --> 02:21:59.870]  thought it looked like a good idea to send the issue to voters but at this point he does need
[02:21:59.870 --> 02:22:06.110]  to abstain i don't know if it's going to be kicked back he said i'm really not sure where we are
[02:22:06.830 --> 02:22:14.190]  at this point all right so there's no uh certainty in the future of recreational marijuana in canyon
[02:22:14.190 --> 02:22:18.830]  city if you guys uh are in canyon city do what you got to do to get out there and vote get out
[02:22:18.830 --> 02:22:23.870]  there and wave signs encourage your uh your congress people we got to get some recreational
[02:22:23.870 --> 02:22:27.870]  cannabis for you guys out there in canyon city all right i got another news article up here and
[02:22:27.870 --> 02:22:35.310]  then we're gonna get into the hash section of the show as promised and do a little hash 101
[02:22:36.110 --> 02:22:40.670]  and speaking of hash that brings me into our next news article this article is written by mr
[02:22:40.670 --> 02:22:46.350]  william breathes and the headline is new colorado hash laws signed by governor but what do they
[02:22:46.350 --> 02:22:53.230]  actually do the article says yesterday governor john hickenlooper signed a baker's dozen worth
[02:22:53.230 --> 02:22:58.590]  of bills on various topics but arguably the two most high profile measures had to do with marijuana
[02:22:59.150 --> 02:23:04.110]  legislation to establish a one ounce of cannabis equivalent for concentrates and
[02:23:04.110 --> 02:23:09.870]  a proposal to make marijuana edibles more identifiable a prominent marijuana advocate
[02:23:09.870 --> 02:23:14.670]  praises these measures as examples of responsible legislation even though it's quite unclear at this
[02:23:14.670 --> 02:23:19.310]  point what the new laws will actually do the summary notes that the bill directs the department
[02:23:19.310 --> 02:23:24.110]  of revenue to promulgate rules establishing the equivalent of one ounce of retail marijuana flour
[02:23:24.110 --> 02:23:29.230]  in various retail marijuana products the bill authorizes the department to contract for a
[02:23:29.230 --> 02:23:34.670]  scientific study of the equivalency of marijuana flour in marijuana products but there's no telling
[02:23:34.670 --> 02:23:38.990]  what that means in practical terms as westward outlines in the following excerpt
[02:23:41.150 --> 02:23:45.950]  the legislation is vague on the specifics of determining just how much hash is in an ounce of
[02:23:45.950 --> 02:23:50.670]  herb which depends on how strong the ounce of herb is to begin with we kind of talked about that on
[02:23:50.670 --> 02:23:57.710]  this show once a couple episodes ago would they base it on a 30 THC OG Fino or a low THC batch
[02:23:57.710 --> 02:24:03.470]  of something like blueberry even then it's unclear whether legislators want producers to measure
[02:24:03.470 --> 02:24:08.830]  total THC in an ounce or simply estimate how much hash can can be produced from an ounce
[02:24:08.830 --> 02:24:13.150]  all of this would widely impact the amount of concentrates that are legally approved for sale
[02:24:13.710 --> 02:24:18.190]  say for the sake of discussion that the dor determines that there are five grams of pure
[02:24:18.190 --> 02:24:23.150]  THC in an ounce of herb that could mean in in-state residents 21 and up would be able to
[02:24:23.150 --> 02:24:28.910]  purchase about six grams worth of 90 THC hash oil since out-of-state residents are currently
[02:24:28.910 --> 02:24:33.710]  currently limited to purchasing a quarter ounce of cannabis they'd hypothetically only be able to buy
[02:24:33.710 --> 02:24:37.550]  one or two grams at a time that's i think that's what kevin and i agreed to the last time we talked
[02:24:37.550 --> 02:24:43.070]  about this but if the lab the state chooses bases its findings on how much hash can be produced from
[02:24:43.070 --> 02:24:47.710]  an ounce of herb the amounts can be much lower we've spoken with several hash makers who tell
[02:24:47.710 --> 02:24:53.630]  us that 15 that a 15 average return from bud to concentrate is reasonable for vho extraction
[02:24:53.630 --> 02:24:58.830]  which means they get about four grams of hash for every ounce of herb ice water can be even lower
[02:24:58.830 --> 02:25:04.030]  only eight to ten percent resulting in top grade smokable hash and the rest suitable mostly for
[02:25:04.030 --> 02:25:11.710]  cooking i've seen people get 20 or 22 percent returns from some bho and actually i saw a guy get
[02:25:12.270 --> 02:25:17.630]  34 percent return on some live resin the other day but that's not the point here the point is
[02:25:18.110 --> 02:25:24.350]  trying to figure out how much hash that they can sell us and how much hash is equal to the limit of
[02:25:24.350 --> 02:25:29.390]  weed we're actually able to buy now because people are coming from other states i know i pick on texas
[02:25:29.390 --> 02:25:35.390]  a lot but they're coming from texas and oklahoma and they're buying seven grams of hash and uh
[02:25:36.110 --> 02:25:41.630]  it seems sketchy to some people uh i don't think it's sketchy because when the dispensaries had a
[02:25:41.630 --> 02:25:44.990]  lot of hash available that was good and i was new with the hash game i would go by
[02:25:45.630 --> 02:25:49.230]  if they had the durban poison hash i would say can i have all of that please
[02:25:49.230 --> 02:25:53.070]  and i didn't think that was sketchy all right that's enough for the news i'm going to take
[02:25:53.070 --> 02:25:57.950]  a quick dab and a drink of something here and i'm going to get into dab 101
[02:26:01.630 --> 02:26:05.790]  while i take a dab you guys should go check out oilslickpad.com if you're dabbing with me you're
[02:26:05.790 --> 02:26:09.710]  going to need something from oilslick stop getting your mom's table all sticky check out
[02:26:09.710 --> 02:26:49.770]  oilslickpad.com all right stoner dudes and stoner chicks gather around it's time for dab 101
[02:26:55.020 --> 02:26:59.660]  all right we're here for dabs 101 let's start with this one what is a dab
[02:27:00.380 --> 02:27:04.780]  a dab is basically a hit of a cannabis concentrate which is usually bho in my world
[02:27:05.580 --> 02:27:09.260]  some solventless is dabable but for now we're just going to focus on bho
[02:27:10.380 --> 02:27:17.900]  bho is short for butane honey oil bho is hash made with butane and the butane is then purged
[02:27:17.900 --> 02:27:23.340]  off and the results are bho of different consistencies now i did say it's made with
[02:27:23.340 --> 02:27:29.580]  butane but after that the hash is put into a vacuum chamber and heated and the butane is
[02:27:29.580 --> 02:27:33.900]  removed that way so you're not dabbing any butane if it's done properly i'm not going to teach you
[02:27:33.900 --> 02:27:38.140]  guys how to make bho because i don't want to be responsible for you guys hurting yourselves
[02:27:38.940 --> 02:27:43.180]  no matter how many times we say it no matter how many news reports we see of people getting hurt
[02:27:43.180 --> 02:27:51.180]  people still insist on blasting hash indoors so please stop making bho inside it's not safe
[02:27:51.180 --> 02:27:54.940]  all right so i was saying uh we get different uh consistencies of bho
[02:27:55.580 --> 02:28:00.540]  uh some of those different consistencies get different names like uh there's shatter
[02:28:00.540 --> 02:28:07.980]  wax crumble earl sap there's snap and peel and then also there's the new thing which is called
[02:28:07.980 --> 02:28:13.980]  live resin so i'll describe them to you and i'm going to start with shatter shatter is usually
[02:28:13.980 --> 02:28:20.300]  amber in color uh it's usually it should shatter if you try to break it but if you heat it up with
[02:28:20.300 --> 02:28:24.540]  your fingers it will get sticky and it'll be bendable but when you first pick it up it should
[02:28:24.540 --> 02:28:29.740]  be snappy it should break like uh maybe like a thin jolly wrench or candy or something like that
[02:28:30.940 --> 02:28:34.860]  most of what you're picking up now what we're finding now is shatter from the dispensaries and
[02:28:34.860 --> 02:28:40.700]  stuff like that it's really close to shatter uh really close to shatter uh there's another type
[02:28:40.700 --> 02:28:46.380]  that's called sap or snap and peel it's really the same color of shatter it's that amber gold color
[02:28:46.380 --> 02:28:51.820]  can be anywhere from like a dark amber to almost a bright yellow i've got some right now that's
[02:28:51.820 --> 02:28:58.140]  really dark it was uh done with some flow and it's uh got some uh tangent there it's flowing
[02:28:58.140 --> 02:29:02.620]  tangent we've been calling it the flange or the flangerine or the tangelo we kind of fuck around
[02:29:02.620 --> 02:29:08.140]  with the names a lot but that one comes out a little bit darker for some reason and then there's
[02:29:08.140 --> 02:29:12.860]  some uh freedom tie lemon baby dabs that have been being made recently that are coming out really
[02:29:12.860 --> 02:29:17.900]  light light gold and yellow so it's all about the product and all about the starting material
[02:29:17.900 --> 02:29:24.140]  it'll make uh different colors so the sap and the snap and peel look very similar in color and
[02:29:24.140 --> 02:29:30.380]  texture to the shatter but they uh of course sap is kind of sappy it's stickier when you fold it
[02:29:30.380 --> 02:29:35.660]  up in parchment paper it sticks to the parchment paper it sticks to your fingers it's kind of goopier
[02:29:36.300 --> 02:29:41.500]  uh there's something that's right between shatter and sap uh i call it snap and peel it doesn't
[02:29:41.500 --> 02:29:45.740]  shatter like shatter does and it doesn't stick but it kind of breaks off it's sort of like a
[02:29:45.740 --> 02:29:50.540]  laffy taffy kind of like the laffy taffy of hash so you can pull off enough to get a good dab you
[02:29:50.540 --> 02:29:56.060]  can mess with it long enough to get it on the dabber and handle it uh but it doesn't break off
[02:29:56.060 --> 02:29:59.980]  and it doesn't stick so it's kind of nice that's one of your better ones it's the snap and peel and
[02:29:59.980 --> 02:30:05.340]  i also think that it's higher quality most of the time when it's the snap and peel uh that style
[02:30:05.340 --> 02:30:11.420]  usually seems to have a lot of flavor to it in my opinion so uh there's also wax wax is real
[02:30:11.420 --> 02:30:16.700]  popular in the dispensaries and it's kind of easy to make a lot of the wax people are skipping a
[02:30:16.700 --> 02:30:21.500]  step and they're doing the whip part too soon but that's the main difference between shatter and
[02:30:21.500 --> 02:30:26.380]  wax uh right towards the end there you basically whip it like it's a cake batter you stir it up
[02:30:26.380 --> 02:30:31.580]  real good and that adds air to the hash which makes it fluff up and it gives it a waxy texture
[02:30:32.540 --> 02:30:37.420]  i like wax a lot because it's easy to handle and it also it seems to give a big fat hit like when
[02:30:37.420 --> 02:30:41.580]  you take a fat chunk of wax and you hit that you really feel that in your lungs it's like a kick
[02:30:41.580 --> 02:30:47.420]  it's not uh for some reason shatter feels smoother to me and the wax hits harder which sometimes i
[02:30:47.420 --> 02:30:52.540]  like you know sometimes you like a shag under the head you're in the mood for it uh there's some
[02:30:52.540 --> 02:30:57.820]  wax that doesn't stick together and that's uh just because of the texture of the plant material or
[02:30:58.700 --> 02:31:01.100]  there are a lot of things that can contribute to that but the crumble
[02:31:01.660 --> 02:31:06.300]  is basically wax that won't stay together it crumbles apart uh there's nothing wrong with it
[02:31:06.300 --> 02:31:11.500]  it just won't stick together for some reason it could be moisture it could be the a lot of oil in
[02:31:11.500 --> 02:31:18.620]  the in the hash itself so that's shatter wax crumble uh earl uh we just call a lot of the
[02:31:18.620 --> 02:31:25.340]  stuff that we smoke earl uh my name is earl you know everything is earl nowadays there are a lot
[02:31:25.340 --> 02:31:34.620]  of other cool names for it i also talked about uh live resin uh so when you're making bho you can
[02:31:34.620 --> 02:31:39.100]  either use nugs or trim and i believe that the better you uh put in the better quality you put
[02:31:39.100 --> 02:31:44.060]  in the better quality you get out but some people now they're taking a plant that is ready for
[02:31:44.060 --> 02:31:50.140]  harvest you cut it down you let it dry for three or four hours then at that point you put it in
[02:31:50.140 --> 02:31:56.140]  the freezer and you let it get nice and frozen once the whole plant's frozen they put it into a
[02:31:56.780 --> 02:32:01.340]  closed loop system and we'll talk about that again later uh they put the whole plant into a closed
[02:32:01.340 --> 02:32:06.300]  loop system and they blast it with the butane that way so after it comes out of the closed loop uh
[02:32:06.300 --> 02:32:11.100]  they put it into a vacuum oven and they purge off all the residual butane that could be left in there
[02:32:11.820 --> 02:32:18.380]  and the hash that comes out of that is called live resin and it tastes delicious uh it's some
[02:32:18.380 --> 02:32:23.100]  of the best tasting hash i've ever had it also gives me a an amazing high and it seems to last
[02:32:23.100 --> 02:32:29.180]  longer uh in my opinion live resin would retain more of the beneficial compounds than hash made
[02:32:29.180 --> 02:32:36.540]  from dried material like uh dried trim or dried buds uh but it does require a closed loop and it's
[02:32:36.540 --> 02:32:41.900]  pretty advanced tech so live resin is like next level shit i feel like now's the time when i
[02:32:41.900 --> 02:32:47.420]  should mention that you should not ever use contaminated material uh don't ever use moldy
[02:32:47.420 --> 02:32:54.140]  buds or moldy trim like if you had powdery mildew or bud rot don't use that shit in your bho
[02:32:54.860 --> 02:32:59.980]  if you had bugs i mean if you want to if you're the only one dabbing it if you don't care go for
[02:32:59.980 --> 02:33:03.340]  it but if you're going to give that to somebody sell that to somebody if you're going to give that
[02:33:03.340 --> 02:33:08.300]  to a medical patient if you're going to give that to a sick person don't ever make dabs with your
[02:33:08.300 --> 02:33:13.020]  buggy ass material that's not good for anybody all right please don't do that try to think about your
[02:33:13.020 --> 02:33:19.100]  patients think think that every piece of hash you ever make or have or even your buds think of all
[02:33:19.100 --> 02:33:23.580]  of that stuff imagine what would happen if you gave that stuff to a sick person because you don't know
[02:33:23.580 --> 02:33:29.020]  where it's going so try to be conscious of that that's our responsibility as growers as hash makers
[02:33:30.060 --> 02:33:33.660]  as part of a cannabis community all right that's what makes us the difference between the people
[02:33:33.660 --> 02:33:38.300]  that care and the people that are just in it to make a buck and also be very aware of everything
[02:33:38.300 --> 02:33:42.220]  that you're spraying on your plants because that's going to end up in your dabs if you're
[02:33:42.220 --> 02:33:47.740]  spraying systemic neurotoxins onto your plants you will be dabbing systemic neurotoxins in the
[02:33:47.740 --> 02:33:52.380]  future you're planning on using that as medicine that's what dabs are intended for as medicine so
[02:33:52.380 --> 02:33:56.620]  don't use your medicine as something that's going to make you sick because that's why we're using
[02:33:56.620 --> 02:34:00.300]  cannabis in the first place is because we don't want to take the medicine that they're forcing
[02:34:00.300 --> 02:34:07.580]  upon us that is making us sick so fight the power help yourself fight the power all right so before
[02:34:07.580 --> 02:34:13.100]  we can do dabs we're gonna have to talk about a gear list this is where it gets fun so let's say
[02:34:13.100 --> 02:34:17.820]  that you uh have acquired some dabs you went to the dispensary you called your guy whatever
[02:34:17.820 --> 02:34:22.140]  happened however it happened you got some high-grade dabs uh you're gonna notice that you
[02:34:22.140 --> 02:34:27.500]  need some special packaging for those dabs probably came hopefully it came wrapped in parchment paper
[02:34:27.500 --> 02:34:33.020]  maybe it came in a little silicone package if you're using those silicone packages i only
[02:34:33.100 --> 02:34:39.100]  recommend oil slick oil slick is platinum cured silicone i recommend you go to oilslickpad.com
[02:34:39.100 --> 02:34:43.820]  and read about the process of platinum curing their products because it's very important
[02:34:44.380 --> 02:34:48.940]  so once you get home get those dabs get it out of that parchment paper get it out of whatever they
[02:34:48.940 --> 02:34:54.220]  they sold it to you in and go on oilslickpad.com and get yourself a little slick stack or a slick
[02:34:54.220 --> 02:34:58.700]  ball or a slick ball mini get a couple of them and then fill all those up with different types
[02:34:58.940 --> 02:35:03.340]  of dabs so now you got a little dab collection and a safe container to keep it in the cool thing
[02:35:03.340 --> 02:35:08.060]  about those slick stacks is uh your hash won't stick to those you won't get ripped off you always
[02:35:08.060 --> 02:35:12.060]  feel like if you put it in plastic or glass you're gonna get ripped off and don't go trying to scrape
[02:35:12.060 --> 02:35:15.900]  those last couple of dabs off the plastic because you're gonna end up dabbing plastic
[02:35:15.900 --> 02:35:20.540]  it's gonna taste like shit you're gonna choke and that's gonna suck you're not gonna have a good time
[02:35:21.340 --> 02:35:24.940]  all right so you got yourself a slick stack you got your hash stored up nice and safely
[02:35:25.900 --> 02:35:29.820]  now you were probably going to notice that that hash is real sticky kind of hard to handle
[02:35:30.460 --> 02:35:35.420]  you're going to need to get some dab tools or maybe a highly educated dabber or maybe a highly
[02:35:35.420 --> 02:35:41.180]  educated dabber with a carb cap on it it'll stand upright for you but you need something to stick
[02:35:41.180 --> 02:35:45.420]  in there to handle those dabs for you because it's going to stick to your fingers if your fingers are
[02:35:45.420 --> 02:35:50.780]  warm you got to get those dabs onto the onto the tip of a dabber somehow and then uh that dabber
[02:35:50.860 --> 02:35:55.660]  is actually going to be going to be the key to your success here pretty soon and also be careful
[02:35:55.660 --> 02:35:59.420]  the first time you go dab it into a container a shatter you're going to stick your dabber right
[02:35:59.420 --> 02:36:04.780]  into that container and i've said it before uh as soon as you push down into that container a shatter
[02:36:04.780 --> 02:36:08.140]  a little piece of that shatter is going to go flying off into nowhere and you're never going
[02:36:08.140 --> 02:36:13.900]  to find it you're going to be pissed so don't lose your first dab uh be gentle maybe stick your thumb
[02:36:13.900 --> 02:36:17.260]  in there warm it up with your thumb rub it with your thumb a little bit that'll make the hash a
[02:36:17.260 --> 02:36:21.260]  little softer and it'll be more pliable then you'll be able to get a dab off of it without
[02:36:21.260 --> 02:36:25.900]  wasting your first dab if you do uh launch one off into the middle of nowhere we always say that's
[02:36:25.900 --> 02:36:30.300]  one for the dead homies like how i used to pour out a 40 now you just flick a dab off into the
[02:36:30.300 --> 02:36:34.460]  middle of nowhere i'd be thankful that it didn't go into your eye because when it does it fucking
[02:36:34.460 --> 02:36:39.820]  burns trust me all right so now you've got your dabs you got yourself some shatter or some sap
[02:36:40.380 --> 02:36:44.460]  you know how to get it out of the container without wasting it uh it's time to uh figure out
[02:36:44.460 --> 02:36:49.740]  a little bit more of this gear the most important thing you're going to need is a rig and a nail
[02:36:50.620 --> 02:36:55.980]  a rig is basically everybody tries to call it a bong if you're smoking earl through it that's
[02:36:55.980 --> 02:37:01.020]  your rig it's an oil rig so you need a rig i prefer a small rig we'll talk about that later
[02:37:01.020 --> 02:37:06.300]  one of the twitter questions was why do i use such a small rig i'll explain that to you in the future
[02:37:06.300 --> 02:37:11.580]  uh you also need a nail uh nails are either made of uh well they're made of titanium or my favorite
[02:37:11.580 --> 02:37:17.820]  there's also ceramic there's glass and there's quartz i'm not a fan of the glass they never seem
[02:37:17.820 --> 02:37:23.340]  to taste right to me the quartz is awesome however i break shit which is also why i don't use the
[02:37:23.340 --> 02:37:30.540]  ceramic i prefer the titanium uh if i'm gonna buy a nail i only buy a highly educated nail to tell
[02:37:30.540 --> 02:37:37.420]  you the truth tonight i've been dabbing off of a highly educated duality nail shout out to task
[02:37:37.420 --> 02:37:43.580]  thanks a lot bro so i know i say this a lot but really invest in your nail uh if you have a budget
[02:37:43.580 --> 02:37:47.500]  spend uh the smaller portion on your rig and the higher portion on your nail because you're going
[02:37:47.500 --> 02:37:51.740]  to be heating that sucker up to a really high temperature between four and six hundred degrees
[02:37:51.740 --> 02:37:55.980]  maybe hotter depending on how crazy you are with the torch but you're going to be heating that up
[02:37:55.980 --> 02:37:59.580]  and then you're dropping your medicine onto that and you're smoking it off of that so you're
[02:38:00.140 --> 02:38:05.260]  basically inhaling whatever is in or on that nail if you've got some funky shit from china they don't
[02:38:05.260 --> 02:38:09.980]  care about you our friends here in america that are making good products i'll recommend hive and
[02:38:09.980 --> 02:38:16.860]  i'll also recommend highly educated uh they make good stuff uh the halen honey hole awesome that's
[02:38:16.860 --> 02:38:21.900]  good shit right there those are three products you got a quartz uh you got a titanium and you got
[02:38:21.900 --> 02:38:28.700]  your ceramics so the hive the halen honey hole and the anything from uh highly educated any highly
[02:38:28.700 --> 02:38:34.060]  educated titanium product has got my endorsement all day long so get yourself a good nail get a
[02:38:34.060 --> 02:38:39.100]  rig i like a little tiny rig i said that before now you're going to need a dabber and a torch
[02:38:39.100 --> 02:38:44.940]  those are the first few things you need be careful with the torch everybody gets scared of you when
[02:38:44.940 --> 02:38:50.380]  you pull out a blow torch be careful where you do that you need a little dab torch i like the vector
[02:38:50.380 --> 02:38:55.020]  torch they're a little more expensive but they do have a lifetime guarantee i like to wrap them up
[02:38:55.020 --> 02:39:00.220]  in stickers i've got a custom torch with the chewbacca on it it was actually a creme brulee
[02:39:00.220 --> 02:39:04.700]  torch that came from bed bath and beyond that my buddy customized for me so if you're not a big
[02:39:04.700 --> 02:39:10.220]  spender go to bed bath and beyond you can get the 30 creme brulee torch it works just as well
[02:39:10.220 --> 02:39:15.740]  as the vector but it doesn't have a lifetime guarantee so now you got your rig you got your
[02:39:15.740 --> 02:39:22.060]  nail you got a torch you need a dabber a dabber is basically it's a poker that you use to drop
[02:39:22.060 --> 02:39:26.860]  your dab you just put a little dab on the end of it just a little tiny dab we'll talk about dab size
[02:39:26.860 --> 02:39:32.860]  in the future also so you just take a little dab you put it on the end of your dabber you heat up
[02:39:32.860 --> 02:39:37.340]  your nail with your torch and you don't have to go fucking destroying this thing with heat you just
[02:39:37.340 --> 02:39:42.700]  need it hot enough if you put your hand over it you just barely want to feel your skin tighten up
[02:39:42.700 --> 02:39:46.060]  and get a little hot you don't want to burn you don't want to touch it but you want to like hold
[02:39:46.060 --> 02:39:50.940]  your hand over it and feel the heat you're just trying to melt this hash so if you're using a rig
[02:39:50.940 --> 02:39:56.780]  that has a dome on it you put the dome over the nail now and then you put the hash inside of there
[02:39:56.780 --> 02:40:01.660]  directly onto the nail if you've got a dome less nail don't drop it right down the hole put it in
[02:40:01.660 --> 02:40:07.980]  the area around the hole and if you've got a carb cap put the carb cap over it and just inhale as
[02:40:07.980 --> 02:40:13.580]  soon as you touch that and you're gonna get a nice fat dab if you did it right all right so now we're
[02:40:13.580 --> 02:40:18.140]  familiar with the rig the nail and the torch and the dabber i talked about a carb cap i'll explain
[02:40:18.140 --> 02:40:25.260]  that a little bit later you're also probably going to need like an oil slick pad or possibly a rig
[02:40:25.260 --> 02:40:32.300]  rag or some sort of dab pad you're gonna have some residual uh leftover dabs on your dabber
[02:40:32.300 --> 02:40:38.380]  after a lot of dabbing a dab pad a 710 dab pad is a good place to wipe that on an oil slick slick pad
[02:40:39.020 --> 02:40:43.900]  or a slab pad is also an excellent place for that a slab pad is also a good idea it keeps your uh
[02:40:43.900 --> 02:40:50.060]  keeps your rigs safe from the table and a rig rag is also handy but it's not as classy as the other
[02:40:50.060 --> 02:40:56.540]  two just something to wipe that excess uh damage off of also you may be uh you may see uh the email
[02:40:56.540 --> 02:41:01.420]  coming out somewhere the email is the electric nail let's talk about that there are a bunch of
[02:41:01.420 --> 02:41:05.740]  different brands available lately but most of them do the same thing uh the email is basically the
[02:41:05.740 --> 02:41:12.300]  electric nail uh it plugs into the wall it's got a little box uh most of them look like a small uh
[02:41:12.300 --> 02:41:17.020]  like a piece of musical gear a small amplifier or something you know like a it looks just like my
[02:41:17.020 --> 02:41:20.940]  little focus right audio interface here is about what most of them look like little box
[02:41:20.940 --> 02:41:25.660]  with a couple switches on it and then a cord coming out of it and the cord attaches to a
[02:41:25.660 --> 02:41:32.460]  nail most people are using the highly educated infiniti nail so you put this heat element onto
[02:41:32.460 --> 02:41:37.420]  your nail and that sits on the rig and it always stays hot at the perfect temperature so you could
[02:41:37.420 --> 02:41:43.180]  drop that down to a nice low temp you can set your dab on there then you throw the car the carb cap up
[02:41:43.180 --> 02:41:47.100]  on top of that and you let it sit for just half a second and then you start dabbing it and you
[02:41:47.100 --> 02:41:54.540]  really get a nice flavored perfect uh heat dab uh i think it's great it does make me uh over dab a
[02:41:54.540 --> 02:41:58.140]  little bit honestly when i have it sitting on the table i tend to take extra dabs because i don't
[02:41:58.140 --> 02:42:02.300]  have to sit there and heat the nail but when you're having a social gathering and there are a
[02:42:02.300 --> 02:42:06.220]  lot of dabs going around it's really helpful because i find the torch to be slightly abrasive
[02:42:06.220 --> 02:42:11.660]  when there's conversation going on that's just my opinion so uh when you're balling get yourself an
[02:42:11.660 --> 02:42:17.500]  e-nail uh it's worth the cost in butane alone you'll save so much butane from heating up the rig
[02:42:18.540 --> 02:42:25.500]  a lot of people uh talk about hitting a vape pen i'm gonna piss a lot of people off here a pen hit
[02:42:25.500 --> 02:42:31.020]  is not a dab that's not dabbing uh that's cool for if you're at the movie theater or maybe it's
[02:42:31.020 --> 02:42:38.140]  cool for your girlfriend but just get a rig and take a dab all right so we should have a basic
[02:42:38.140 --> 02:42:42.060]  understanding of what dabs are we should know what the gear is you should know how to handle
[02:42:42.060 --> 02:42:47.420]  your dabs by now it seems like there's only one thing left to do let's take a fat dab together
[02:42:47.420 --> 02:42:53.100]  i'm gonna put a nice sticky dab of some shatter onto this highly educated carb cap with the dabber
[02:42:53.100 --> 02:42:58.940]  on it i like the flat tip the best i've learned then i'm gonna grab my torch here and i'm gonna
[02:42:58.940 --> 02:43:04.060]  heat up the nail uh this nail i usually have to give it about a 10 or 12 count i'm gonna hold it
[02:43:04.060 --> 02:43:10.940]  away from the microphone i usually go one two three four i'm sure you guys can count to 12 right
[02:43:13.180 --> 02:43:18.780]  so it should be uh getting pretty close all right that gets me about there i can tell that it's hot
[02:43:18.780 --> 02:43:22.940]  enough by looking at it i can see that it's slightly getting orange let it cool for just a
[02:43:22.940 --> 02:43:27.260]  brief moment here now uh here's where i take a dab take a dab with me guys please do
[02:43:46.730 --> 02:43:50.490]  all right now i'm gonna cough for a couple of seconds and then we'll come back and answer a
[02:43:50.490 --> 02:43:55.210]  couple of twitter questions hey don't be afraid to cough and turn red and sweat and shit after
[02:43:55.210 --> 02:43:59.610]  your first couple of dabs we expect that of you if you're not choking a cough and you're not taking
[02:43:59.610 --> 02:44:04.250]  big enough dabs give me a minute to get my shit together we'll come back and work on these twitter
[02:44:04.250 --> 02:44:16.490]  questions all right welcome back i hope everybody survived their dabs all right so let's get to
[02:44:16.490 --> 02:44:20.330]  these twitter questions uh i said earlier that i was going to answer the question why do i use such
[02:44:20.330 --> 02:44:25.530]  a small rig somebody saw me post an instagram little clip and i was using a little tiny mad
[02:44:25.530 --> 02:44:31.770]  rob rig uh i like a little tiny rig uh the purpose of a large bong is so that you could fill it up
[02:44:31.770 --> 02:44:36.570]  with smoke and then pull the carb and then you get all that smoke at once uh with the dab you're just
[02:44:36.570 --> 02:44:41.210]  taking a little tiny dab and you don't really want to fill it with smoke you just want to get that
[02:44:41.210 --> 02:44:46.170]  smoke to your head so a little rig takes less sucking and less air uh if i had a great big rig
[02:44:46.650 --> 02:44:50.970]  a great big bong i'd have to suck all that air through to try to get that dab through and it
[02:44:50.970 --> 02:44:55.130]  just feels like i'm sucking a lot of air because you can't fill it up with smoke you can only get
[02:44:55.130 --> 02:44:58.730]  so much dab i mean you're not going to carve it because you got the it's hot it's hot as shit the
[02:44:58.730 --> 02:45:04.090]  nail is really hot so that's why i use a small rig because i don't want to smoke air i want to
[02:45:04.090 --> 02:45:10.010]  smoke a fat dab right to my face i want just enough water to cool it down i don't need a whole lot of
[02:45:10.010 --> 02:45:14.970]  special percolation just uh a basic perk is cool with me because i just need that to cool it i'm
[02:45:14.970 --> 02:45:19.610]  not trying to get really filtered like you do with your cannabis i don't want to over filter it i
[02:45:19.610 --> 02:45:25.770]  want to cool it down punch it right to my head so that's why i use a small rig uh another question
[02:45:25.770 --> 02:45:32.170]  was about dab size and how much uh hash am i smoking not me myself how much hash are people
[02:45:32.170 --> 02:45:37.850]  smoking in a dab how much is what's a serving size or a dose uh i'd start off with like about
[02:45:37.850 --> 02:45:44.090]  a sesame seed size dab uh maybe a piece of like a piece of rice i think a piece of rice
[02:45:44.090 --> 02:45:53.130]  is probably about 0.02 of a gram so the average medical patient or the average dab consumer
[02:45:53.130 --> 02:46:01.290]  is going to take about a 0.02 to maybe like a 0.1 would be kind of a larger dab but uh some people
[02:46:01.290 --> 02:46:08.490]  take up to 0.2 or 0.25 you know just depends on what you're getting into and how big you like to
[02:46:08.490 --> 02:46:16.010]  do i did a little bit of math uh there are 28 grams uh in an ounce and if you get a 20 percent
[02:46:16.010 --> 02:46:24.490]  return that turns into 5.6 grams of hash basically smoking a 0.2 dab is the equivalent of smoking
[02:46:24.490 --> 02:46:32.650]  one gram of herb in one hit by yourself so you can go anywhere from 0.2 or 0.02 all the way up
[02:46:32.650 --> 02:46:36.570]  to 0.2 with your dabs i've done a gram before but i wouldn't recommend it don't do that
[02:46:37.290 --> 02:46:40.890]  my lungs are still fucked up from it they never will be the same i don't think from
[02:46:40.890 --> 02:46:45.290]  taking too large of a dab several times not just once but i did it over and over again
[02:46:45.850 --> 02:46:51.530]  and i think i uh i hurt myself another thing to think about is uh it takes a lot more heat to
[02:46:51.530 --> 02:46:56.170]  heat up a big fat dab than it does to heat up a little dab so just take a bunch of little dabs
[02:46:56.170 --> 02:46:59.610]  and it requires a little bit less heat and your lungs don't get all that heat in there
[02:47:00.890 --> 02:47:04.730]  yeah i say that but then i look over at my dabber and i've got a big gigantic dab sitting there
[02:47:04.730 --> 02:47:08.330]  waiting for me i'm gonna take a big dab i'll answer one more twitter question
[02:47:08.330 --> 02:47:10.570]  then we're gonna give thanks and start wrapping up the show
[02:47:12.890 --> 02:47:17.850]  all right i hope you guys enjoyed that dab i sure did my last question from twitter is what is with
[02:47:17.850 --> 02:47:24.650]  this 710 what does 710 mean well 710 is nice and simple if you turn the number 710 upside down
[02:47:24.650 --> 02:47:31.370]  spells the word oil if you've been listening oil is all about the dabs in one of my early episodes
[02:47:31.370 --> 02:47:37.050]  i mentioned that if somebody sent me a tweet with uh who coined the phrase 710 that i would
[02:47:37.050 --> 02:47:41.290]  send them some stickers as a prize somebody actually tweeted me the correct answer maybe
[02:47:41.290 --> 02:47:45.370]  it was on instagram but you sent the correct answer uh you just need to give me your mailing
[02:47:45.370 --> 02:47:50.170]  address so that i can send you those stickers uh the correct answer was task rock and the guys from
[02:47:50.170 --> 02:47:55.530]  healthstone so now we're gonna give thanks and then we're gonna wrap up the show here we go
[02:47:56.330 --> 02:48:01.290]  this episode we're gonna give thanks to my friend big d daniel de sai i don't think the hash move
[02:48:01.290 --> 02:48:06.330]  and the 710 community could be where it is today without the help of big d uh big d was the founder
[02:48:06.330 --> 02:48:13.050]  of top shelf extracts he's a cannabis cup winner uh big d actually gave me my very first real dab
[02:48:13.050 --> 02:48:17.530]  at the cannabis cup at the broadway wellness booth when we had the first cup here in denver
[02:48:17.530 --> 02:48:23.210]  at the exto so i wouldn't be the dabber i am today i wouldn't be able to give you this info today
[02:48:23.210 --> 02:48:28.810]  without the inspiration and the help from big d uh big d is the host of the secret cup the secret
[02:48:28.810 --> 02:48:32.650]  cup is a secret so i'm not going to tell you too much about it but it is a dab competition
[02:48:33.370 --> 02:48:39.450]  they host regional competitions they have a finals and then they also have the national championships
[02:48:39.450 --> 02:48:44.650]  uh it's a hash competition but it's a secret uh it's going on right now big d's in california
[02:48:44.650 --> 02:48:51.050]  working his ass off i hope you get to hear this big thanks much love one year for 710 big d hosted
[02:48:51.050 --> 02:48:56.730]  an event called the dabs of denver he had a bunch of uh raffle items to give away and he sold raffle
[02:48:56.730 --> 02:49:00.890]  tickets they threw a big fat show at the oriental theater where we were able to dab out and have a
[02:49:00.890 --> 02:49:05.610]  real community event there were a bunch of people there that night and there was also a huge raffle
[02:49:05.610 --> 02:49:11.290]  and big d donated all the proceeds to a local care center so that they could buy a van to get all of
[02:49:11.290 --> 02:49:16.090]  the disabled folks to their doctor's appointments to make their lives a little bit easier uh that's
[02:49:16.090 --> 02:49:20.810]  just one example of the awesome things that big d does for people uh he's a big guy he's got a big
