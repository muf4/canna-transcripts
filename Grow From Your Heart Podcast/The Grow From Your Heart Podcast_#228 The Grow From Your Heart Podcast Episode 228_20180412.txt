[00:00.000 --> 00:01.360]  Yo, what up podcast world?
[00:01.360 --> 00:05.520]  It's Rasta Jeff and it's Thursday, so that means it's time for another throwback Thursday
[00:05.520 --> 00:08.440]  episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:08.440 --> 00:11.980]  Before I get into the block of old episodes, let me make a quick disclaimer.
[00:11.980 --> 00:16.520]  If I mention any advertising, any promotions, any contests, or any giveaways, those have
[00:16.520 --> 00:17.520]  all expired.
[00:17.520 --> 00:22.360]  There are currently no contests, no promotions, no advertising, or no giveaways.
[00:22.360 --> 00:24.880]  Also, let me update all of the social media.
[00:24.880 --> 00:29.960]  If you want to find me on Twitter, you can find me at GFYH Podcast on Twitter, on Facebook,
[00:29.960 --> 00:32.240]  simply search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.

[00:36.760 --> 00:39.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you enjoy these chunks of old episodes.
[00:39.760 --> 00:43.800]  Here we go with a throwback Thursday episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:43.800 --> 01:02.160]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[01:02.160 --> 01:06.760]  It's time for episode number 71 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[01:06.760 --> 01:07.760]  news, education, and conversation.
[01:07.760 --> 01:08.760]  That's right.
[01:08.760 --> 01:13.600]  If you're a new grower and if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a veteran
[01:13.600 --> 01:16.960]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist, or even someone who's just curious about the
[01:16.960 --> 01:20.480]  current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[01:20.480 --> 01:22.040]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[01:22.040 --> 01:23.040]  Thanks again for joining me.
[01:23.040 --> 01:26.640]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to the Mystic Roots Band for letting
[01:26.640 --> 01:28.760]  me use their music on my podcast.
[01:28.760 --> 01:31.560]  Big thanks to Kat, Coop, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:31.560 --> 01:35.720]  You guys are listening to the doggy dub off the album, The Constant Struggle.
[01:35.720 --> 01:37.040]  Make sure you check those guys out for me.
[01:37.040 --> 01:38.040]  It's the Mystic Roots Band.
[01:38.040 --> 01:39.040]  Send them some love.
[01:39.040 --> 01:40.040]  What's going on, guys?
[01:40.040 --> 01:41.040]  I am coming to you all by myself today.
[01:41.040 --> 01:42.040]  I do not have a guest.
[01:43.040 --> 01:48.040]  I'm going to do an episode about ways to improve your garden.
[01:48.040 --> 01:51.400]  One way to improve your garden is to use organic soil amendments.
[01:51.400 --> 01:53.480]  Where do you get organic soil amendments?
[01:53.480 --> 01:57.240]  You can get your organic soil amendments from the Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[01:57.240 --> 02:00.140]  The organic portions of this episode were brought to you by my friends at the Rocky
[02:00.140 --> 02:01.180]  Mountain Worm Company.
[02:01.180 --> 02:05.960]  Visit the Rocky Mountain Worm Company in Colorado Springs to get your fresh worm castings, African
[02:05.960 --> 02:09.320]  nightcrawlers, red wigglers, and all of your organic soil amendments.
[02:09.320 --> 02:14.120]  The Rocky Mountain Worm Company has Dragonfly Earth Medicine products in stock right now.
[02:14.120 --> 02:16.400]  The Rocky Mountain Worm Company will ship to your door.
[02:16.400 --> 02:20.640]  You can get the same worm castings and many of the same amendments that I use in my garden
[02:20.640 --> 02:21.640]  through www.RockyMountainWormCompany.com.
[02:21.640 --> 02:22.640]  Check that out today.
[02:22.640 --> 02:29.760]  If you visit the store, it's at 411 Tijuana Street in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[02:29.760 --> 02:32.680]  Make sure you let them know that you heard about the show through the podcast.
[02:32.680 --> 02:37.360]  Big shout out to all my friends at the Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[02:37.360 --> 02:40.040]  Before we get much further, if you guys are interested in sponsoring the show, send me
[02:40.040 --> 02:43.760]  an email at growfromyourheartathotmail.com and I'll get you all that information.
[02:43.760 --> 02:45.160]  I would like to take a second now.
[02:45.160 --> 02:50.080]  I'm going to turn down that music and we are going to read an iTunes comment.
[02:50.080 --> 02:51.360]  It's going to take me a second to get there.
[02:51.360 --> 02:52.360]  It's a couple of clicks away.
[02:52.360 --> 02:53.360]  Oh, it went away.
[02:53.360 --> 02:54.360]  I got to search for it again.
[02:54.360 --> 02:55.360]  I can't play the opening music and have this up at the same time.
[02:55.360 --> 02:56.360]  I'm just not a multitasker.
[02:56.360 --> 02:57.360]  My computer didn't like that.
[02:57.360 --> 02:58.360]  They're both coming from iTunes.
[02:58.360 --> 02:59.360]  I had to leave the screen.
[02:59.360 --> 03:00.360]  Anyway, I'm going to it.
[03:00.360 --> 03:01.360]  I promise.
[03:01.360 --> 03:02.360]  I'm just talking while I do it.
[03:02.360 --> 03:03.360]  I'm going to play the opening music.
[03:03.360 --> 03:04.360]  I'm going to turn down that music.
[03:04.640 --> 03:05.640]  Anyway, I'm going to it.
[03:05.640 --> 03:06.640]  I promise.
[03:06.640 --> 03:08.500]  I'm just talking while I do it.
[03:08.520 --> 03:09.520]  Ratings and reviews.
[03:09.520 --> 03:10.520]  We're going to scroll down here.
[03:10.520 --> 03:12.520]  We're going to turn on the music as soon as I get to it.
[03:12.520 --> 03:13.520]  All right.
[03:13.520 --> 03:14.520]  Check this out.
[03:14.520 --> 03:17.260]  The latest review says, from iTunes.
[03:17.260 --> 03:18.260]  By Mr. Minor.
[03:18.260 --> 03:20.120]  This was left on April 23rd.
[03:20.120 --> 03:24.340]  He left me a five-star rating and it says, I found this podcast recently and I just love
[03:24.340 --> 03:25.340]  it.
[03:25.340 --> 03:29.600]  Jeff is articulate, thoughtful, considerate and he has a deep knowledge base that he shares
[03:29.600 --> 03:31.240]  selflessly.
[03:31.240 --> 03:32.240]  This is a true gem.
[03:32.240 --> 03:36.620]  I love plugging in and kicking back while listening to all the information and fun.
[03:36.620 --> 03:37.620]  Thanks for doing it.
[03:37.620 --> 03:39.080]  Thank you, Mr. Minor.
[03:39.080 --> 03:44.040]  I definitely appreciate you messaging or leaving a comment and saying that you love the show.
[03:44.040 --> 03:49.140]  That's really great that you notice I am sharing this selflessly.
[03:49.140 --> 03:50.380]  I've gotten a lot of credit for that.
[03:50.380 --> 03:51.380]  And that's, I learned a lot.
[03:51.380 --> 03:53.980]  It took me a long time to learn this.
[03:53.980 --> 03:59.080]  And I feel like that I want to, I think I'm bettering the plant and medical marijuana
[03:59.080 --> 04:03.140]  and recreational marijuana by teaching everybody to grow better cannabis.
[04:03.140 --> 04:04.440]  So I think that's my goal.
[04:04.440 --> 04:05.920]  Thanks for noticing is what I'm trying to say.
[04:05.920 --> 04:06.920]  Thanks for the comment.
[04:06.920 --> 04:08.080]  Thanks for the five stars.
[04:08.080 --> 04:09.080]  That's really fucking cool.
[04:09.080 --> 04:10.960]  Yes, thanks for the comment.
[04:10.960 --> 04:15.080]  Guys, leave a comment on iTunes and I will read that on a future episode.
[04:15.080 --> 04:21.000]  If you don't want to leave a comment on iTunes, you can go to Twitter, you can go to Facebook,
[04:21.000 --> 04:22.000]  you can email me.
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.680]  There are a lot of ways to get in touch with me.
[04:25.680 --> 04:27.880]  It's growthfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[04:27.880 --> 04:31.560]  It's at GFYH podcast or search for Grow From Your Heart on Facebook.
[04:31.560 --> 04:35.000]  If you want to follow me on Instagram, it's at I Regenetics.
[04:35.000 --> 04:38.600]  Yeah, that's a lot of social media stuff there.
[04:38.600 --> 04:39.600]  Let's move on a little bit.
[04:39.600 --> 04:42.520]  I want to talk about our main subject for the day.
[04:42.520 --> 04:46.560]  Let's talk a little bit about ways to improve your crop.
[04:46.560 --> 04:50.480]  As I opened my phone, I just saw the most terrible tweet, you guys.
[04:50.480 --> 04:54.480]  I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the legend, I'm going to kill the music here and
[04:54.480 --> 04:55.480]  say this.
[04:55.480 --> 04:56.480]  I'm making sure this is true.
[04:57.080 --> 04:58.080]  Yeah, it's true, you guys.
[04:58.080 --> 05:01.760]  I have to tell you this on the podcast.
[05:01.760 --> 05:04.640]  You've already heard this because this episode is going to come out in a week from now, but
[05:04.640 --> 05:06.720]  BB King has passed away.
[05:06.720 --> 05:09.240]  Blues legend, BB King is no longer with us.
[05:09.240 --> 05:12.720]  I'm going to take a really brief moment of silence for BB King, and then I'll tell you
[05:12.720 --> 05:15.560]  about my favorite BB King performance I've ever seen.
[05:15.560 --> 05:17.840]  I'm going to take just a brief ... This is a podcast.
[05:17.840 --> 05:20.040]  We can't do long moment of silence, but this is for BB King.
[05:20.040 --> 05:21.040]  Here we go.
[05:21.040 --> 05:23.500]  All right.
[05:23.500 --> 05:26.860]  That was out of respect because BB King ... I'm a huge musician.
[05:26.860 --> 05:28.900]  I've played music for my whole life.
[05:28.900 --> 05:33.100]  I've been a drummer for ... I've been a drummer longer than I have not been a drummer.
[05:33.100 --> 05:38.780]  I got drums for my 15th birthday, and it was all I cared about for probably 10, maybe 15,
[05:38.780 --> 05:40.020]  20 years was the drums.
[05:40.020 --> 05:41.020]  It was all that mattered.
[05:41.020 --> 05:45.220]  Then I had a daughter, and that changed some shit.
[05:45.220 --> 05:50.060]  I used to play in a band called the Chromebenders with a guy named Brian Ritchie, and Donovan
[05:50.060 --> 05:51.900]  McNeely, and Kenny Nicholson.
[05:51.900 --> 05:55.580]  There were other guys that rotated in and out of that band, but those were ... Our bass
[05:55.580 --> 05:56.580]  player was Dennis.
[05:56.580 --> 05:59.340]  I can't forget the bass guy.
[05:59.340 --> 06:01.100]  There were several guys ... Dennis Morgan, by the way.
[06:01.100 --> 06:04.940]  There were several guys that rotated in and out of that band, but Brian Ritchie and I
[06:04.940 --> 06:07.300]  were always in that band together.
[06:07.300 --> 06:10.620]  We used to do The Thrill Is Gone, which is a BB King tune.
[06:10.620 --> 06:11.620]  Oh, man.
[06:11.620 --> 06:13.460]  We would play the shit out of it.
[06:13.460 --> 06:15.980]  There's something ... BB wrote amazing songs.
[06:15.980 --> 06:19.420]  I want to talk about my favorite BB King musical moment that I've seen.
[06:19.420 --> 06:22.900]  I did not get to see BB King on stage.
[06:22.900 --> 06:25.300]  There were so many shows that I chose to go to that I had to skip some.
[06:25.300 --> 06:29.380]  I've seen a lot of Fish, and Moe, and Widespread Panic, and stuff along that lines, but I skipped
[06:29.380 --> 06:32.060]  all the BB King chances, and now I kind of regret it.
[06:32.060 --> 06:38.260]  I saw him on the HBO 25th anniversary of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame show.
[06:38.260 --> 06:40.620]  I don't remember the exact title, but those words are in there.
[06:40.620 --> 06:44.820]  It's the 25th anniversary, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
[06:44.820 --> 06:49.140]  Stevie Wonder's band performed, and several musicians came out and performed with Stevie
[06:49.140 --> 06:50.140]  Wonder's band.
[06:50.140 --> 06:55.260]  They do a montage, and then they bring out BB King, and they did The Thrill Is Gone.
[06:56.220 --> 07:01.100]  There are some moments in that song when the hair on the back of my neck stands up.
[07:01.100 --> 07:02.100]  It's an amazing performance.
[07:02.100 --> 07:04.500]  Unfortunately, guys, BB King is gone.
[07:04.500 --> 07:06.260]  Big shout out to BB King.
[07:06.260 --> 07:08.420]  Nobody like him on that guitar.
[07:08.420 --> 07:10.620]  Take a minute, listen to some BB, feel some blues.
[07:10.620 --> 07:14.340]  All right, I did not want to see that on the phone there right during a show, but they
[07:14.340 --> 07:16.660]  gave me some content, right?
[07:16.660 --> 07:17.660]  Let's see.
[07:17.660 --> 07:18.660]  Where was I?
[07:18.660 --> 07:19.660]  I'm throwing off now.
[07:19.660 --> 07:20.660]  Death is never a comforting feeling.
[07:20.660 --> 07:21.860]  All right, ways to improve your crop.
[07:21.860 --> 07:24.100]  Let's change the vibe of this shit.
[07:24.100 --> 07:27.500]  Ways to improve our crop.
[07:27.500 --> 07:30.860]  One major way to improve your crop, and you guys are going to say, you're a seed breeder.
[07:30.860 --> 07:33.780]  Of course you say that, but this is why I'm a seed breeder.
[07:33.780 --> 07:38.020]  A way to improve your crop is to use high quality genetics.
[07:38.020 --> 07:43.500]  Get a clone from somebody you trust that has ran that clone, and it's a clone that you
[07:43.500 --> 07:47.620]  know is going to do well, so that you're not wasting your time, wasting your space, wasting
[07:47.620 --> 07:52.140]  electricity, money, nutrients on a plant that isn't worth a shit.
[07:52.180 --> 07:57.300]  Get a good quality strain, good quality genetics.
[07:57.300 --> 08:01.900]  Of course I'm going to recommend some Irie Genetics, some Rare Dankness.
[08:01.900 --> 08:05.700]  I really like Gage Green Genetics, La Plata Labs.
[08:05.700 --> 08:07.860]  Those are just a few of the brands that I really trust.
[08:07.860 --> 08:09.140]  There are a lot more.
[08:09.140 --> 08:11.800]  Those are just a few off the top of my head that if I were going to grow from seed, those
[08:11.800 --> 08:13.860]  are the guys I would grab.
[08:13.860 --> 08:18.300]  Gage Green, La Plata Labs, they're friends of mine, and I trust their shit.
[08:18.300 --> 08:19.980]  Irie Genetics, of course, is my brand.
[08:19.980 --> 08:21.380]  I trust my shit.
[08:21.380 --> 08:22.880]  Get some good, trustworthy genetics.
[08:22.880 --> 08:27.460]  If you can go to Kind Love in Denver, they quite often have great genetics available.
[08:27.460 --> 08:29.020]  They have the Lemon Jeffrey available.
[08:29.020 --> 08:30.380]  Get yourself a clone of that.
[08:30.380 --> 08:33.100]  You'll grow some amazing cannabis.
[08:33.100 --> 08:34.100]  Ways to improve your crop.
[08:34.100 --> 08:36.820]  Number one, use quality genetics.
[08:36.820 --> 08:39.780]  Part B to that is learn those genetics.
[08:39.780 --> 08:44.060]  Don't expect to pull off an amazing cannabis cup winning crop the first time you grow a
[08:44.060 --> 08:45.060]  strain.
[08:45.060 --> 08:46.300]  You're going to have to learn it.
[08:46.300 --> 08:48.300]  Some plants want different shit at different times.
[08:48.700 --> 08:51.900]  You're going to have to figure out what the temperature and humidity is for that plant
[08:51.900 --> 08:52.900]  that is ideal.
[08:52.900 --> 08:56.300]  You're going to have to figure out how long it takes to flower it.
[08:56.300 --> 08:57.300]  Learn that plant.
[08:57.300 --> 08:58.540]  Develop a relationship with it.
[08:58.540 --> 09:02.500]  Once you've got a relationship with that plant, you can really start dialing in the room,
[09:02.500 --> 09:05.300]  the nutrients, the time.
[09:05.300 --> 09:06.300]  Learn the plant.
[09:06.300 --> 09:09.060]  Use quality genetics and learn the genetics you're using.
[09:09.060 --> 09:10.460]  All right.
[09:10.460 --> 09:12.780]  Number two, ways to improve your crop.
[09:12.780 --> 09:17.780]  This sounds like a no-brainer, guys, but label everything.
[09:17.780 --> 09:20.820]  You wouldn't believe how many times I thought, I'll remember what that is, and then later
[09:20.820 --> 09:24.300]  on in the future, I don't know what the hell that clone is.
[09:24.300 --> 09:26.340]  Now I'm trying to grow some random clone.
[09:26.340 --> 09:28.460]  I got to wait and see what it looks like when it flowers.
[09:28.460 --> 09:31.340]  I got to smell it, figure out what the hell it is.
[09:31.340 --> 09:34.860]  Label everything, you guys.
[09:34.860 --> 09:38.760]  This is number three, but it's also kind of a part B of number two.
[09:38.760 --> 09:39.860]  Take a lot of notes.
[09:39.860 --> 09:43.240]  When you're labeling shit, take a lot of notes.
[09:43.240 --> 09:45.200]  Take notes of when that clone was cut.
[09:45.200 --> 09:47.500]  Take notes of when that clone went into a cup.
[09:47.500 --> 09:50.080]  Take notes of when that clone went into a pot.
[09:50.080 --> 09:54.400]  Take notes of when that pot is up-potted into a bigger pot.
[09:54.400 --> 09:56.540]  Take notes the day it went into flower.
[09:56.540 --> 09:57.540]  Take a lot of notes.
[09:57.540 --> 09:59.580]  I write down every feeding that I mix.
[09:59.580 --> 10:03.740]  I write that shit down so that if I see something amazing, I know what I did.
[10:03.740 --> 10:06.300]  I don't forget what I did last time.
[10:06.300 --> 10:08.060]  So make a lot of notes, you guys.
[10:08.060 --> 10:12.660]  Also, if you do any super cropping, any tweaking of the plants, any topping, any pinching,
[10:12.660 --> 10:16.460]  if you use any bug sprays, any shit like that, just write it down.
[10:16.460 --> 10:20.620]  By the way, when you have amazing results or shitty results, you have a record to look
[10:20.620 --> 10:23.940]  back on and you can look through the notes and go, oh, look, dude, here is right where
[10:23.940 --> 10:24.940]  we fucked up.
[10:24.940 --> 10:27.940]  And you can find it, you can identify it, and you can correct it.
[10:27.940 --> 10:31.700]  So label everything thoroughly and take notes.
[10:31.700 --> 10:36.220]  Here's something that sounds obvious to me, but I've noticed a lot of people are ignoring
[10:36.220 --> 10:37.220]  this.
[10:37.220 --> 10:41.380]  I work as a consultant and people in my neighborhood can call me and invite me to their house and
[10:41.380 --> 10:46.220]  I do charge a small fee, but I will come look at your garden wherever it is and I will give
[10:46.980 --> 10:49.660]  you a little bit of advice or correct your issues or your problems and help you get back
[10:49.660 --> 10:51.020]  on the right track.
[10:51.020 --> 10:56.720]  One thing I often see is people do not pay any attention to the pH.
[10:56.720 --> 11:01.580]  When you are mixing up your nutrients or your reservoir of clean water, before that goes
[11:01.580 --> 11:08.580]  into the water or into your pots of plants, the pH needs to be adjusted.
[11:08.580 --> 11:12.740]  If you're using organics, ignore this because the organics, you'll kill the organics by
[11:12.740 --> 11:15.380]  using anything to adjust it.
[11:15.380 --> 11:17.620]  Organics will buffer themselves.
[11:17.620 --> 11:18.620]  They'll work themselves out.
[11:18.620 --> 11:19.620]  Excuse me guys, I'm burping.
[11:19.620 --> 11:22.060]  Okay, I'm better now.
[11:22.060 --> 11:26.180]  So if you're using synthetic nutrients or bottled nutrients, make sure you pay attention
[11:26.180 --> 11:27.180]  to the pH.
[11:27.180 --> 11:30.780]  This is super critical in hydro and really important in soil.
[11:30.780 --> 11:32.400]  Either way, pay attention to your pH.
[11:32.400 --> 11:37.460]  When you mix up your water, when you mix up your nutrients, you want to have that final
[11:37.460 --> 11:41.680]  mix come out about 6.5 before you pour it into your plants.
[11:41.680 --> 11:47.160]  So fill your thing with water, put the desired nutrients in there at the desired amount,
[11:47.160 --> 11:50.360]  check it with your PPM meter, if you're even using one of those, that's another thing to
[11:50.360 --> 11:52.840]  pay attention to, your parts per million.
[11:52.840 --> 11:54.960]  We'll talk about that in the future.
[11:54.960 --> 11:58.720]  Check it with your PPM meter, then put your pH meter in there.
[11:58.720 --> 12:00.960]  It's probably going to be a little bit high still.
[12:00.960 --> 12:03.480]  You need to get it down to about 6.5.
[12:03.480 --> 12:07.600]  So you're going to need to add something, probably a pH down product to that, just a
[12:07.600 --> 12:09.120]  little bit at a time.
[12:09.120 --> 12:14.280]  Mix it up again, put your pH meter in there and do it until you're about 6.5.
[12:14.280 --> 12:18.440]  If you're going hydro, you might want to go 5.8, 5.5-ish.
[12:18.440 --> 12:20.760]  I'm not the hydro expert yet, so don't quote me on that.
[12:20.760 --> 12:25.640]  I am definitely learning hydro, definitely learning quickly on the hydro because it's
[12:25.640 --> 12:27.640]  all we're doing at the spot.
[12:27.640 --> 12:29.560]  So pay attention to your pH, you guys.
[12:29.560 --> 12:31.200]  I can see the problems in your leaves.
[12:31.200 --> 12:34.720]  When your leaves start doing stupid shit, it's usually because of pH.
[12:34.720 --> 12:37.360]  And then that's going to mimic other deficiencies.
[12:37.360 --> 12:41.840]  And you're going to think, oh, I've got a CalMag deficiency or, oh, I've got a nitrogen
[12:41.840 --> 12:45.720]  deficiency, when really the only problem is that your pH of your feeding is off and your
[12:45.720 --> 12:47.280]  plants don't want to drink it.
[12:47.280 --> 12:52.280]  So your plants will react by showing you problems and you'll try to correct problems that don't
[12:52.280 --> 12:53.280]  even exist.
[12:53.280 --> 12:55.320]  And then you'll probably create more problems.
[12:55.320 --> 12:58.840]  So you guys make sure the pH is correct of your feeding.
[12:58.840 --> 13:01.880]  Also something I should add to that, I'm going to skip ahead a little bit.
[13:01.880 --> 13:02.880]  Where is this note?
[13:02.880 --> 13:03.880]  Wow.
[13:04.040 --> 13:05.960]  This is some tough stuff, you guys.
[13:05.960 --> 13:06.960]  Use clean water.
[13:06.960 --> 13:10.080]  This is something I can really stress right now, since we're talking about pH.
[13:10.080 --> 13:11.760]  Use clean water.
[13:11.760 --> 13:15.960]  Most growers will recommend RO water if you can, that's reverse osmosis water, but that
[13:15.960 --> 13:19.720]  does require kind of an expensive filtration system.
[13:19.720 --> 13:24.040]  And if you're just doing a small home grow, it's a little ridiculous, but the big growers
[13:24.040 --> 13:26.280]  will definitely recommend reverse osmosis.
[13:26.280 --> 13:31.840]  We've got at the spot dispensary where I'm the grower there, we've got several thousand
[13:31.840 --> 13:35.160]  gallons of reverse osmosis water being cleaned all day.
[13:35.160 --> 13:36.960]  You wouldn't believe the water tanks we have.
[13:36.960 --> 13:42.800]  We've got, I think there are four 1000 tanks in the RO room and they stay full.
[13:42.800 --> 13:44.680]  And we pump that into separate rooms.
[13:44.680 --> 13:48.800]  Each room's got four 250 gallon tanks in it, which is where those dump into.
[13:48.800 --> 13:51.420]  So we're using a lot of RO water in there.
[13:51.420 --> 13:59.360]  If you're unable to get RO water, a good idea is to fill your reservoir and then put an
[13:59.360 --> 14:01.160]  air stone and air pump.
[14:01.160 --> 14:04.000]  You don't put the air pump in the water, you guys put the air stone in the water, put a
[14:04.000 --> 14:09.240]  little tubing to the air pump, plug the air pump in, and that will oxygenate your water.
[14:09.240 --> 14:13.920]  And what that will do is it'll bring the water that's at the bottom to the top and it'll
[14:13.920 --> 14:17.200]  push the chlorine and whatever else they're putting in our water.
[14:17.200 --> 14:18.720]  Now it'll clean that out for you a little bit.
[14:18.720 --> 14:22.640]  It'll bring it to the surface and the chlorine has to make it to the surface to evaporate.
[14:22.640 --> 14:25.600]  So putting some oxygen there will definitely help you out.
[14:25.600 --> 14:28.720]  Try to do that for at least 24 hours.
[14:28.720 --> 14:32.280]  It's always good to get the chlorine out before you mix any nutrients in there, or
[14:32.280 --> 14:37.200]  especially if you're making an organic tea, it's definitely a good idea to try to bubble
[14:37.200 --> 14:39.280]  out that chlorine as long as you can.
[14:39.280 --> 14:44.040]  I've almost always got a big, it's the Brute trash can.
[14:44.040 --> 14:47.800]  I've got a trash can on wheels and then I've got a little area with a little set up of
[14:47.800 --> 14:49.960]  water or a little bubbler set up next to it.
[14:49.960 --> 14:53.400]  And I just fill that trash can up and then I roll that over to this area and I just drop
[14:53.400 --> 14:54.800]  the air stones in it.
[14:54.800 --> 14:59.200]  So it's almost always filled with bubbling water and then I can mix into that if I need
[14:59.200 --> 15:03.160]  to or I can make smaller portions in five gallon buckets out of that if I need to.
[15:03.160 --> 15:07.400]  I just try to keep that clean water on hand all the time.
[15:07.400 --> 15:08.400]  That's another thing.
[15:08.400 --> 15:09.400]  That's a good idea.
[15:09.400 --> 15:11.320]  I kind of skipped around on my notes, but this is going to help us out.
[15:11.320 --> 15:13.600]  This gets me back on track here.
[15:13.600 --> 15:15.560]  I said, have that water prepared.
[15:15.560 --> 15:20.640]  My next note is plan ahead and have your rooms ready and allow time for your plants to recover
[15:20.640 --> 15:22.560]  from topping and training.
[15:22.560 --> 15:28.240]  So that's two things in one there, but plan ahead to have your rooms ready.
[15:28.240 --> 15:31.400]  You're going to have plants that are vegging and they're going to start getting too tall
[15:31.400 --> 15:32.400]  and shit.
[15:32.400 --> 15:34.120]  And you're going to be like, I really need to flower these.
[15:34.120 --> 15:37.440]  That's when you're going to wish that you'd planned ahead and thought about this room
[15:37.440 --> 15:39.320]  is going to be done at this time.
[15:39.320 --> 15:41.160]  This area will be done at this time.
[15:41.160 --> 15:42.800]  These plants will need to go here.
[15:42.800 --> 15:46.400]  Really try to plan ahead and think about what you're going to do with each plant and when
[15:46.400 --> 15:48.400]  you're going to do it.
[15:48.400 --> 15:51.360]  And that's a good time for me to tease and let you know that I have been working on the
[15:51.360 --> 15:54.600]  episode about scheduling a perpetual grow.
[15:54.600 --> 15:55.600]  I ran into a problem.
[15:55.600 --> 15:58.840]  I didn't know how to deal with the fact that I don't know how many lights you guys have.
[15:58.840 --> 16:02.040]  So how the hell am I going to write a schedule for your grow rooms?
[16:02.040 --> 16:04.440]  But I'm juggling it around and I think I've got the idea.
[16:04.440 --> 16:07.120]  We're just going to kind of condense it and make it a small grow.
[16:07.120 --> 16:09.600]  And then you guys can expand on it if you hang more lights.
[16:09.600 --> 16:11.400]  That's what we're going to have to do.
[16:11.400 --> 16:14.520]  So I was talking about planning ahead, having your rooms ready.
[16:14.520 --> 16:18.800]  And then the second part of that was allow time for your plants to recover from topping
[16:18.800 --> 16:20.080]  and training.
[16:20.080 --> 16:25.040]  So we're going to talk a little bit about topping, training, super cropping, scrogging,
[16:25.040 --> 16:30.640]  tomato cages, using sticks for supports, and LST a little bit.
[16:30.640 --> 16:31.640]  That's going to be just...
[16:31.640 --> 16:36.320]  I don't have any notes on this, so I'm just going to ramble about this part for a minute.
[16:36.320 --> 16:40.880]  These are all methods that we would use to control the shape of our plant and the height
[16:40.880 --> 16:44.600]  of our plant and also to improve the yield of our plant.
[16:44.600 --> 16:49.080]  By keeping the plant, instead of growing one huge cola that sticks up and then having the
[16:49.080 --> 16:53.740]  rest of the plant kind of low, we want to kind of eliminate that one huge cola and make
[16:53.740 --> 16:59.720]  a nice canopy so that the plant is getting even light and that there's not one bud blocking
[16:59.720 --> 17:02.880]  everything and taking up all the light and making shadows.
[17:02.880 --> 17:04.360]  We want to get one nice canopy.
[17:04.360 --> 17:08.880]  So ways to do that are topping.
[17:08.880 --> 17:10.480]  I've talked about it a little bit.
[17:10.480 --> 17:13.760]  When the plant starts to grow nodes, so you've got your main stock coming up and you've got
[17:13.760 --> 17:15.280]  a bunch of intersections.
[17:15.280 --> 17:18.540]  Those are nodes, all those branches that grow out, those are nodes.
[17:18.540 --> 17:23.620]  If you go down a few nodes and cut out the main center stock, you have just now basically
[17:23.620 --> 17:28.440]  topped your plant and you've created multiple tops.
[17:28.440 --> 17:31.780]  Cannabis wants one main top naturally.
[17:31.780 --> 17:36.780]  So all of the small tops that were sub-tops will now start creeping up and try to become
[17:36.780 --> 17:38.180]  new dominant tops.
[17:38.180 --> 17:41.220]  So that's topping a plant.
[17:41.220 --> 17:42.540]  I can't really explain it much better.
[17:42.540 --> 17:48.420]  You just go from the top cola and then just go down and then keep kind of look.
[17:48.420 --> 17:52.300]  If I cut it here, how many branches are going to be left and is it going to be kind of even?
[17:52.300 --> 17:57.620]  And then you can, don't be afraid to fuck up a couple, but don't go fucking up a bunch
[17:57.620 --> 17:58.620]  of them.
[17:58.620 --> 17:59.940]  Kind of top one and see what you like.
[17:59.940 --> 18:02.980]  Cut off a little bit at a time because you can cut more, but you can't put shit back
[18:02.980 --> 18:03.980]  on plants.
[18:03.980 --> 18:05.620]  So that's topping.
[18:05.620 --> 18:10.800]  Super cropping is kind of, I learned super cropping from a guy named Soma.
[18:10.800 --> 18:15.040]  Super cropping is when you kind of take the stem of the plant and I rub it between my
[18:15.040 --> 18:16.640]  fingers to soften it.
[18:16.640 --> 18:18.840]  And then I pinch it a little to crack the stem.
[18:18.840 --> 18:23.160]  And then I honestly just push the branch right over at a 90 degree angle.
[18:23.160 --> 18:27.440]  So if I had one branch that was growing taller than the rest of my plants, I would find a
[18:27.440 --> 18:30.840]  spot just a little bit lower than the rest of the tops.
[18:30.840 --> 18:34.620]  And I would just break that branch right there and bend it over at a 90 degree angle.
[18:34.620 --> 18:36.500]  And for about a day, it's going to look like shit.
[18:36.500 --> 18:37.760]  It's going to look like it might die.
[18:37.760 --> 18:41.560]  But the next morning when the lights come on, you'll go in there and look and that branch
[18:41.560 --> 18:43.320]  will be perfectly horizontal.
[18:43.320 --> 18:47.040]  It'll be broken, bent at a 90 degree angle, perfectly horizontal.
[18:47.040 --> 18:51.360]  And the end of it will start growing right back up again toward the light.
[18:51.360 --> 18:55.040]  And now you've kind of straightened that out so that you'll have a more level, even canopy.
[18:55.040 --> 18:58.960]  And it also, where that branch was broken, I think it'll be a little bit stronger than
[18:58.960 --> 19:00.420]  it ever was before.
[19:00.420 --> 19:03.520]  That's a little bit of what super cropping is.
[19:03.520 --> 19:08.680]  Super cropping is also, I will grab the main stock of the plant where it comes out of the
[19:08.680 --> 19:10.960]  soil and I'll put two fingers on it.
[19:10.960 --> 19:12.540]  And then I'll put two fingers above there.
[19:12.540 --> 19:16.840]  And I will twist it and pop that branch until I hear a crack.
[19:16.840 --> 19:21.020]  And then I will move my hand, the hand that was on the bottom, I'll put it right above
[19:21.020 --> 19:23.700]  the hand, the other hand.
[19:23.700 --> 19:27.100]  So now I'm just grabbing up a little higher and just crack again.
[19:27.100 --> 19:30.300]  And then I'll take my left hand and put it right above my right hand and crack again.
[19:30.300 --> 19:32.820]  And then put the right hand above the left and crack again.
[19:32.820 --> 19:36.860]  It's where I've cracked up this plant like 10 or 12 times right up the main stock.
[19:36.860 --> 19:40.500]  And what this does, it'll make little knuckles in there.
[19:40.500 --> 19:42.620]  And those are, they toughen up that stock.
[19:42.620 --> 19:45.460]  That main stock will get a little bit stronger.
[19:45.460 --> 19:49.140]  And I think a thicker stock that's a little bit stronger also can move more nutrients.
[19:49.140 --> 19:53.780]  And it can also support bigger branches, which also can support bigger buds in the future.
[19:53.780 --> 19:55.380]  And that's our goal.
[19:55.380 --> 19:58.180]  So you can also do this to branches as well.
[19:58.180 --> 20:00.340]  I will grab the branch and just turn it just a little bit.
[20:00.340 --> 20:02.020]  And you'll hear crunch, crunch, crunch.
[20:02.020 --> 20:05.300]  And you're just breaking that cellulose wall in there so that it has to rebuild.
[20:05.300 --> 20:07.260]  It sounds like you're popping your knuckle.
[20:07.260 --> 20:08.380]  It'll freak you out.
[20:08.380 --> 20:09.740]  Try not to do it too frequently.
[20:09.740 --> 20:12.860]  You have to let the plant heal from it once you do it.
[20:12.860 --> 20:16.220]  But if you've got time and space to veg and you're trying to keep your plants fat and
[20:16.220 --> 20:20.980]  healthy, super cropping is a really cool way to do it.
[20:20.980 --> 20:23.540]  Let's also talk a little bit about scrogging.
[20:23.540 --> 20:26.260]  We talked about scrogging when we had Spence on.
[20:26.260 --> 20:27.900]  This is all mostly canopy management stuff.
[20:27.900 --> 20:31.180]  We talked about this with Spencer, but I'm going to go over it again with you guys.
[20:31.180 --> 20:34.940]  Scrogging is when you use the screen or the net and you let your plants grow.
[20:34.940 --> 20:38.460]  And then you kind of put the screen on them and push them down and then they just flatten
[20:38.460 --> 20:41.020]  out and then they start growing through the screen a little bit.
[20:41.020 --> 20:45.740]  And you try to get one cola through each part of the screen and then you get that nice even
[20:45.740 --> 20:49.860]  canopy because our goal is to have an even canopy instead of one big cola.
[20:49.860 --> 20:53.180]  You want a bunch of small colas that get even light.
[20:53.180 --> 20:54.500]  It just helps out for the grow.
[20:54.500 --> 20:56.740]  And those big buds aren't extra valuable or anything.
[20:56.740 --> 20:59.700]  They're actually kind of a pain in the ass for the grower.
[20:59.700 --> 21:03.980]  So we've talked about super cropping, topping, scrogging, tomato cages.
[21:03.980 --> 21:07.780]  I really like to use a tomato cage, you guys, because in a seven gallon pot, one of those,
[21:08.100 --> 21:11.780]  I think it's an 18 inch around tomato cage.
[21:11.780 --> 21:17.140]  It's a nice top and you can get, if you top the plant twice, you get about eight good
[21:17.140 --> 21:20.860]  heads off of the plant and you got just enough space around that tomato cage.
[21:20.860 --> 21:25.260]  You can use the cage to support the buds and you can also use the cage to pull the buds
[21:25.260 --> 21:27.020]  apart to get more light.
[21:27.020 --> 21:30.180]  If you spread those branches apart, you get more light to each bud.
[21:30.180 --> 21:34.320]  Try to use that square footage of your light space a little bit better.
[21:34.320 --> 21:38.200]  So I put the tomato cage on early and then I let it veg with the cage on and then I start
[21:38.200 --> 21:42.240]  pulling it out and strapping it up to the edges of the cage just to make room in there.
[21:42.240 --> 21:46.800]  And then you can use the cage to keep it supported or you can tie it into the cage to keep it
[21:46.800 --> 21:49.240]  up or you can tie it outside of the cage to keep it apart.
[21:49.240 --> 21:55.440]  The cage just really gives you a lot of opportunity and support and it's very versatile too.
[21:55.440 --> 21:57.360]  Also I've talked about using bamboo sticks.
[21:57.360 --> 22:01.720]  A lot of times I'll just get some bamboo sticks in there, shove those right into the dirt,
[22:01.720 --> 22:05.160]  tie the branches up to there, pull them apart a little bit.
[22:05.160 --> 22:08.080]  Those are good ways to get more light to the plant.
[22:08.080 --> 22:14.760]  So topping, super cropping, scrogging, tomato cages, and just using regular sticks are good
[22:14.760 --> 22:20.000]  ways to pull the branches apart, get a little more canopy management, get more light down
[22:20.000 --> 22:21.640]  to the middle of the plant.
[22:21.640 --> 22:24.640]  And also I think pulling the big buds apart gives you a little more airspace and they
[22:24.640 --> 22:26.440]  really like that.
[22:26.440 --> 22:29.320]  LST is low stress training.
[22:29.320 --> 22:34.220]  It's kind of the scrog method also with a little bit of super cropping.
[22:34.220 --> 22:37.160]  So you want to just kind of bend and twist the plants a little bit to keep them in the
[22:37.160 --> 22:39.720]  shape you want and keep them low.
[22:39.720 --> 22:44.240]  The trick here is to make the plants low and bushy so that we can fill space and not use
[22:44.240 --> 22:47.760]  a lot of plants because in the medical game, it's all about plant counts.
[22:47.760 --> 22:51.640]  And in Colorado, in the rec game, you're allowed to have six plants and they don't care how
[22:51.640 --> 22:52.980]  big they are.
[22:52.980 --> 22:56.720]  So you can grow six fucking house size plants if you know how to do it.
[22:57.120 --> 23:01.320]  And a little bit of cropping, super cropping, LST kind of stuff will definitely do it for
[23:01.320 --> 23:02.320]  you.
[23:02.320 --> 23:03.320]  All right.
[23:03.320 --> 23:06.400]  We've kind of gone over the canopy management stuff.
[23:06.400 --> 23:08.980]  So I was really quick on that.
[23:08.980 --> 23:11.680]  Another part that I can talk about, and we're going to wrap this episode up pretty quickly.
[23:11.680 --> 23:15.440]  I've noticed you guys like the 30 minute episodes better.
[23:15.440 --> 23:17.960]  One thing I should really talk about is pay attention to the room.
[23:17.960 --> 23:21.920]  Many problems are from the room or the environment that you've created.
[23:21.920 --> 23:26.800]  Be aware of the day and nighttime temperatures and the humidity through veg and bloom.
[23:26.800 --> 23:31.920]  Too low of humidity and veg will stunt the growth of your plants and it'll lead to deficiencies.
[23:31.920 --> 23:33.800]  It kind of mimics a deficiency.
[23:33.800 --> 23:36.960]  When there's not enough humidity, the plants will mimic problems.
[23:36.960 --> 23:40.880]  And again, you'll be trying to correct something and really all you need to do is increase
[23:40.880 --> 23:43.180]  the humidity in the room.
[23:43.180 --> 23:46.240]  So too low humidity will stunt the plants, lead to deficiencies.
[23:46.240 --> 23:51.520]  Too much humidity will lead to mildew issues and it can also slow the growth of your plants
[23:51.520 --> 23:53.400]  and veg.
[23:53.400 --> 24:00.880]  So for veg, try to stay around 50% or above and max out around 75% humidity in veg.
[24:00.880 --> 24:04.840]  You can go a little higher, but that's when you start running the risk of problems.
[24:04.840 --> 24:06.320]  Try to keep it consistent.
[24:06.320 --> 24:12.880]  For the veg stage, try to keep temps around 74 to 77 degrees during the day period.
[24:12.880 --> 24:17.920]  Anywhere from 77 or 72 to 82 is okay for most strains.
[24:18.040 --> 24:23.520]  What I've noticed is 74 to 77 degrees during the day is prime in my experience.
[24:23.520 --> 24:28.840]  All of my plants in veg, 74 to 77 degrees, they go nuts, they thrive.
[24:28.840 --> 24:32.160]  And keep in mind, this is just the room temperature.
[24:32.160 --> 24:35.120]  This is not leaf surface temperature.
[24:35.120 --> 24:37.040]  Leaf surface temperature is a whole other story.
[24:37.040 --> 24:39.320]  We'll talk about that in another episode.
[24:39.320 --> 24:43.960]  So for the night cycle, try to get around 68 to 75 degrees, guys.
[24:43.960 --> 24:44.960]  So I'll sum that up.
[24:45.000 --> 24:52.040]  For veg, you want your temps 70 to 80 degrees for the day, 68 to 75 at night, and 50 to
[24:52.040 --> 24:55.000]  75% humidity during the veg cycle.
[24:55.000 --> 24:57.920]  I'm going to interrupt myself and talk about something.
[24:57.920 --> 25:04.440]  When you walk in your grow room, if you can smell dirt and soil and pot and moist air
[25:04.440 --> 25:07.880]  and funk, you need more filtration.
[25:07.880 --> 25:11.080]  You need more air coming in and more air going out.
[25:11.080 --> 25:13.200]  It shouldn't smell like a pot garden in there.
[25:13.200 --> 25:16.320]  It might be a little bit humid and a little bit sticky, but you don't...
[25:16.320 --> 25:20.120]  If you can smell the pot garden in your pot garden, that means your neighbors can smell
[25:20.120 --> 25:22.400]  the pot garden down the block.
[25:22.400 --> 25:26.640]  So if you can walk in there and it smells like pot and it smells like soil, you need
[25:26.640 --> 25:29.800]  to get more carbon filters and pull more air out.
[25:29.800 --> 25:33.480]  And then you need to get more HIPAA filters and pull more air in because you're getting
[25:33.480 --> 25:35.320]  stagnant stale air in there.
[25:35.320 --> 25:38.360]  It should not smell like an old funky basement in your grow room.
[25:38.360 --> 25:41.080]  It should smell clean.
[25:41.080 --> 25:43.600]  That's just a random way to improve your grow.
[25:43.600 --> 25:44.600]  That's what we're focused on here.
[25:44.600 --> 25:45.600]  Sorry, my throat's burning up.
[25:45.600 --> 25:46.600]  I'm going to take a drink.
[25:46.600 --> 25:47.600]  It's always about 25 minutes, guys.
[25:47.600 --> 25:48.600]  The throat starts going nuts.
[25:48.600 --> 25:53.870]  And I didn't stop and take a dab in this episode.
[25:53.870 --> 25:55.470]  I tried to preserve the voice a little.
[25:55.470 --> 25:56.870]  I just need a guess.
[25:56.870 --> 25:59.990]  All right, let's get into the flowering phase here.
[25:59.990 --> 26:01.550]  For flowering, we need to make a few adjustments.
[26:01.550 --> 26:05.630]  For humidity, we need to get down to about 40 to 50% humidity.
[26:05.630 --> 26:10.790]  We don't need excess moisture in the room because that will cause mold or rot problems.
[26:10.790 --> 26:13.430]  You guys have heard about my white rhino experience.
[26:13.430 --> 26:17.310]  It's because there was too much moisture in the room and the temperatures got too low
[26:17.310 --> 26:19.430]  and that invited our mildew.
[26:19.430 --> 26:25.030]  So for the bloom phase, it is ideal to have temps hovering between 74 to 77 degrees during
[26:25.030 --> 26:29.790]  the day and 66 to 75 degrees at night.
[26:29.790 --> 26:34.030]  Getting temps too high will slow the plants down again and too low will encourage mold
[26:34.030 --> 26:35.670]  and rot like I've said.
[26:35.670 --> 26:39.670]  If you're growing a strain that has purple characteristics, what you can do is you can
[26:39.670 --> 26:44.630]  lower the temps a little bit around week six or seven of flower and that'll definitely
[26:44.630 --> 26:47.510]  start bringing out the purple color in your plants.
[26:47.510 --> 26:51.430]  All right, that's enough about humidity and temperatures in your crop.
[26:51.430 --> 26:55.470]  I think you guys understand that, but those basic things will definitely improve your
[26:55.470 --> 26:56.470]  grow.
[26:56.470 --> 26:59.070]  A couple more quick tips before I wrap it up.
[26:59.070 --> 27:01.150]  Don't spray some shit on your plants in flower.
[27:01.150 --> 27:05.590]  If your plants are in flower, please do not spray them with any type of bug spray or anything
[27:05.590 --> 27:06.630]  like that.
[27:06.630 --> 27:10.230]  If you're going to hit them with a foliar spray, be really careful and really selective
[27:10.230 --> 27:11.950]  what you spray.
[27:11.950 --> 27:17.270]  Anytime after week three, really, that stuff is going to end up in your buds.
[27:17.270 --> 27:21.810]  Honestly, from the beginning of flower, there's not time for systemic chemicals to get out
[27:21.810 --> 27:25.150]  of your buds or off of your buds in my opinion.
[27:25.150 --> 27:28.550]  But if you're spraying something like fulvic acid and some sea kelp or something to try
[27:28.550 --> 27:31.470]  to increase things, that's not a bad idea.
[27:31.470 --> 27:34.030]  Just be careful when you do it.
[27:34.030 --> 27:36.470]  Don't spray bug sprays at all.
[27:36.670 --> 27:37.990]  Don't spray neem oil.
[27:37.990 --> 27:40.390]  Don't spray pesticides at all during flower.
[27:40.390 --> 27:45.790]  Only spray healthy, helpful foliar sprays and stop those around week five.
[27:45.790 --> 27:47.910]  Please, please, please, please.
[27:47.910 --> 27:54.830]  Also something that I stress a lot to improve your cannabis, flush your plants before harvest.
[27:54.830 --> 27:56.430]  This is involved in planning.
[27:56.430 --> 27:58.430]  We've talked about planning your grow.
[27:58.430 --> 28:01.750]  Plan 14 days to flush your crop before you cut it down.
[28:01.750 --> 28:02.750]  This is super important.
[28:03.350 --> 28:07.790]  Then of course, I'm going to tell you another way to improve your crop is to cure your cannabis.
[28:07.790 --> 28:09.790]  Listen to the episode about drying and curing.
[28:09.790 --> 28:12.390]  That'll really, really help you out.
[28:12.390 --> 28:13.390]  Dry and cure your cannabis.
[28:13.390 --> 28:14.910]  Flush it, dry it, and cure it.
[28:14.910 --> 28:19.030]  Another thing that may help you out guys, don't bring more people to your grow.
[28:19.030 --> 28:21.630]  Those people you bring in is where your bugs come from.
[28:21.630 --> 28:24.030]  Also, here's another quick hint that's just coming out randomly.
[28:24.030 --> 28:27.110]  If you do get a clone from somebody, quarantine that bitch.
[28:27.110 --> 28:28.670]  Hit it with some bug spray.
[28:28.670 --> 28:31.990]  Check it for a couple of days and make sure there are no bugs on it before you introduce
[28:32.030 --> 28:34.950]  it to the general population of your garden.
[28:34.950 --> 28:39.870]  One bug, one russet mite coming into your garden, one russet mite into a new grower's
[28:39.870 --> 28:41.990]  garden could devastate everything.
[28:41.990 --> 28:46.150]  Your crop that is four weeks into flower could be decimated before you could save it.
[28:46.150 --> 28:47.350]  Your mother plants will be eaten.
[28:47.350 --> 28:48.510]  Your veg plants will be eaten.
[28:48.510 --> 28:51.030]  You'll have taken russet mites to all your buddies.
[28:51.030 --> 28:52.630]  It doesn't take much.
[28:52.630 --> 28:55.230]  When you get a clone, quarantine that bitch.
[28:55.230 --> 28:58.790]  Don't bring friends over to your grow to show them because they're bringing powdery mildew,
[28:58.790 --> 29:01.790]  spider mites, root aphids, fucking white flies.
[29:01.790 --> 29:04.030]  They're all traveling on your buddy's clothes with you.
[29:04.030 --> 29:06.030]  So guys, be careful in each other's gardens.
[29:06.030 --> 29:10.150]  Another tip about your garden to make it better, just don't tell people about it.
[29:10.150 --> 29:11.310]  I know you want to show off your garden.
[29:11.310 --> 29:12.990]  You want to show off those big old buds.
[29:12.990 --> 29:15.150]  Make an anonymous Instagram account.
[29:15.150 --> 29:16.630]  Post the pictures to Instagram.
[29:16.630 --> 29:17.950]  Tag your friends or something in it.
[29:17.950 --> 29:21.050]  Just don't make it all braggy to where everybody knows who you are and what you're doing because
[29:21.050 --> 29:23.750]  word travels really, really quickly.
[29:23.750 --> 29:24.750]  All right.
[29:24.750 --> 29:25.750]  I know.
[29:25.750 --> 29:27.270]  I post pictures of my shit and I talk all about it.
[29:27.270 --> 29:28.270]  I'm in Colorado.
[29:28.270 --> 29:29.470]  I grow for a facility.
[29:29.470 --> 29:30.830]  It's a different story, you guys.
[29:30.870 --> 29:32.710]  I'm out of the blue now or I'm out of the woodwork now.
[29:32.710 --> 29:33.710]  I can talk about this.
[29:33.710 --> 29:34.710]  I'm out of the shadows.
[29:34.710 --> 29:35.710]  All right.
[29:35.710 --> 29:38.030]  I feel like I've done about 30 minutes now.
[29:38.030 --> 29:39.510]  Let's look and see how far we're into this.
[29:39.510 --> 29:40.510]  Look at that, 29 minutes.
[29:40.510 --> 29:42.950]  I'm getting good at podcasting, you guys.
[29:42.950 --> 29:46.670]  I think it's time to wrap up this show before my throat goes bananas, before my ADD kicks
[29:46.670 --> 29:49.030]  in, before your ADD kicks in.
[29:49.030 --> 29:50.030]  You know what?
[29:50.030 --> 29:51.030]  We didn't do a dab on the show.
[29:51.030 --> 29:53.030]  I'm going to move the iPhone out of the way.
[29:53.030 --> 29:54.030]  We're going to grab a dab.
[29:54.030 --> 29:55.190]  Let's do a dab together, you guys.
[29:55.190 --> 30:00.630]  I am going to dab some black cherry chem that was grown.
[30:01.430 --> 30:02.430]  I bred this.
[30:02.430 --> 30:03.430]  I grew it.
[30:03.430 --> 30:05.030]  Was I involved in this extraction?
[30:05.030 --> 30:06.670]  No, this one was not extracted by me.
[30:06.670 --> 30:09.110]  This was done by my good friends at the Garden of Weden.
[30:09.110 --> 30:11.310]  Some of the hash I've had my hands in making.
[30:11.310 --> 30:12.830]  I can make myself some pretty decent BHO.
[30:12.830 --> 30:15.030]  I want you guys to take a dab with me, whatever you're dabbing.
[30:15.030 --> 30:16.510]  Get a big fat dab.
[30:16.510 --> 30:20.110]  I'm going to do like a 0.3 here.
[30:20.110 --> 30:21.110]  Don't kill yourselves.
[30:21.110 --> 30:22.390]  I can't get it out.
[30:22.390 --> 30:23.390]  There we go.
[30:23.390 --> 30:25.230]  I'm going to go a little bigger.
[30:25.230 --> 30:26.230]  Little bigger.
[30:26.230 --> 30:27.230]  One more piece.
[30:27.230 --> 30:28.230]  Now it's troublesome.
[30:28.230 --> 30:29.230]  There's always that limit with the dab.
[30:29.830 --> 30:30.830]  It's like go a little bigger.
[30:30.830 --> 30:31.830]  Go a little bigger.
[30:31.830 --> 30:32.830]  Oh, shit.
[30:32.830 --> 30:33.830]  That's too big.
[30:33.830 --> 30:34.830]  So I'm going to grab the e-nail.
[30:34.830 --> 30:36.830]  Shout out to Giddy Up and Emotech.
[30:36.830 --> 30:38.710]  Shout out to Hitman Dougie.
[30:38.710 --> 30:43.950]  We're going to do a dab off the Hitman E-Series sidecar with the highly educated titanium
[30:43.950 --> 30:48.550]  nail hooked up to the Emotech G-nail from Giddy Up.
[30:48.550 --> 30:51.990]  Shout out to all of those people for making my dabs amazing.
[30:51.990 --> 30:52.990]  Take a dab with me, you guys.
[30:52.990 --> 30:53.990]  Here we go.
[30:53.990 --> 30:54.990]  Five, four, three.
[30:54.990 --> 31:06.990]  Oh, yeah.
[31:07.230 --> 31:08.230]  Oh, yeah.
[31:08.230 --> 31:10.430]  I'm card capping and freestyle rapping.
[31:10.430 --> 31:12.890]  Ooh.
[31:12.890 --> 31:16.610]  0.3 and no cough because I'm a boss.
[31:16.610 --> 31:18.130]  What else do I have in here?
[31:18.130 --> 31:19.130]  I got some platinum OG.
[31:19.130 --> 31:20.130]  I've got some Tora Bora.
[31:20.130 --> 31:21.130]  Yeah.
[31:21.130 --> 31:22.130]  Shout out to the dabs.
[31:22.130 --> 31:23.130]  I like dabs a lot.
[31:23.130 --> 31:25.570]  I hope you do too.
[31:25.570 --> 31:27.290]  The next episode, you guys, is going to be...
[31:27.290 --> 31:31.810]  You know, the next episode will probably just be rambles and news because I'm still writing
[31:31.810 --> 31:33.990]  that Perpetual Grow episode.
[31:33.990 --> 31:34.990]  It's boggling my mind.
[31:34.990 --> 31:36.490]  I'm stuck, but I'm going to get it.
[31:36.530 --> 31:39.850]  I actually had a couple of people throw some ideas at me and I figured out how to do it.
[31:39.850 --> 31:41.370]  So we're going to get that together.
[31:41.370 --> 31:44.370]  I will be back in a few days.
[31:44.370 --> 31:45.370]  Thanks a lot for listening, you guys.
[31:45.370 --> 31:48.290]  Don't forget to check out the sponsors, the Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[31:48.290 --> 31:51.810]  If you're interested in sponsoring the podcast or if you've got a product you'd like me to
[31:51.810 --> 31:52.810]  review, send me an email.
[31:52.810 --> 31:53.810]  It's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[31:53.810 --> 31:57.890]  I'll get you all the information that you need.
[31:57.890 --> 31:59.570]  There's the cough from a 0.3.
[31:59.570 --> 32:04.050]  Now that the show's over, please go to the iTunes store or Stitcher.
[32:04.050 --> 32:05.050]  Figure out how to leave a comment.
[32:05.050 --> 32:08.050]  All you got to do is go search for Grow From Your Heart.
[32:08.050 --> 32:09.050]  Find the review section.
[32:09.050 --> 32:10.050]  Give me a five-star rating.
[32:10.050 --> 32:11.250]  After that, type in a comment.
[32:11.250 --> 32:15.370]  Let me know what you think of the show and I will read your comment on a future episode.
[32:15.370 --> 32:19.650]  Stitcher does keep changing the way that the comments are handled, but I usually find them
[32:19.650 --> 32:21.450]  and I will read them on the show.
[32:21.450 --> 32:23.890]  If you have something to say and you're not into the social media thing, you can email
[32:23.890 --> 32:24.890]  me.
[32:24.890 --> 32:25.890]  That's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[32:25.890 --> 32:31.730]  Don't forget that every episode is available on iTunes, Stitcher, and iReadGenetics, colorado.com.
[32:31.730 --> 32:32.730]  I said that wrong.
[32:32.730 --> 32:33.730]  Not every episode.
[32:33.730 --> 32:35.690]  All episodes are on iTunes and Stitcher.
[32:35.690 --> 32:40.410]  Every single episode will always and forever be archived on iReadGenetics, colorado.com.
[32:40.410 --> 32:41.410]  That's my website.
[32:41.410 --> 32:44.230]  They can't take that down.
[32:44.230 --> 32:45.270]  That is mine.
[32:45.270 --> 32:47.370]  Those episodes will be there forever.
[32:47.370 --> 32:51.010]  One through 70 will be there right now if you go and look.
[32:51.010 --> 32:54.370]  I did add a donation button to the podcast page on the website.
[32:54.370 --> 32:57.330]  If you feel like this show is worth a few bucks, you can go to my website, iReadGenetics,
[32:57.330 --> 32:58.530]  colorado.com.
[32:58.530 --> 33:00.450]  Click on the Grow From Your Heart podcast tab.
[33:00.450 --> 33:02.210]  At the top right, that's the donation button.
[33:02.210 --> 33:03.630]  It's a little PayPal logo.
[33:03.630 --> 33:05.350]  That goes directly to my PayPal account.
[33:05.350 --> 33:07.630]  I'll never charge you guys for this podcast.
[33:07.630 --> 33:08.870]  It's always free.
[33:08.870 --> 33:10.230]  This information comes from my heart.
[33:10.230 --> 33:11.270]  It's all yours for free.
[33:11.270 --> 33:13.470]  I give it to you because I love you.
[33:13.470 --> 33:16.910]  If you feel like showing some love and making a contribution to my PayPal account, it would
[33:16.910 --> 33:18.390]  be greatly appreciated.
[33:18.390 --> 33:23.150]  I was driving to Colorado Springs two weeks ago and my transmission blew the fuck up.
[33:23.150 --> 33:24.150]  It was scary.
[33:24.150 --> 33:25.150]  It's expensive.
[33:25.150 --> 33:26.150]  It's stressful.
[33:26.150 --> 33:27.150]  We'll get it figured out.
[33:27.150 --> 33:30.830]  If you want to make a contribution, now is a better time than ever.
[33:30.830 --> 33:32.670]  We're on all the social media sites.
[33:32.670 --> 33:34.430]  I think I told you about that.

[33:35.630 --> 33:36.870]  Make sure you follow us on Twitter.

[33:42.630 --> 33:43.670]  I talked about all that.

[33:45.470 --> 33:48.670]  iReadGenetics now has 15,000 followers.
[33:48.670 --> 33:51.990]  Thanks for everybody that helped me get to 15,000.
[33:51.990 --> 33:53.790]  That's crazy to me.
[33:53.790 --> 33:56.710]  Big shout out to my ninja spins and the entire Garden of Weeden crew.
[33:56.710 --> 33:57.710]  Thanks for listening.
[33:57.710 --> 35:00.580]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[35:00.580 --> 35:04.580]  You'll be sorry someday.
[35:07.580 --> 35:09.580]  The thrill is gone.
[35:10.580 --> 35:13.580]  It's gone away from me.
[35:17.580 --> 35:20.580]  The thrill is gone, baby.
[35:21.580 --> 35:24.580]  The thrill is gone away from me.
[35:24.580 --> 35:35.580]  Although I'm still living, we're so lonely.
[35:40.580 --> 36:23.410]  Welcome back, cannabis community.
[36:23.410 --> 36:27.410]  It's time for episode number 72 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[36:27.410 --> 36:30.410]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[36:30.410 --> 36:31.410]  That's right.
[36:31.410 --> 36:34.410]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a caregiver,
[36:34.410 --> 36:37.410]  if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a cannabis activist,
[36:37.410 --> 36:40.410]  or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[36:40.410 --> 36:43.410]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[36:43.410 --> 36:44.410]  I'm your host, Ross and Jeff.
[36:44.410 --> 36:45.410]  Thanks again for joining me, guys.
[36:45.410 --> 36:47.410]  Sitting across the table from me is my good buddy, Mike.
[36:47.410 --> 36:48.410]  How you doing, bro?
[36:48.410 --> 36:49.410]  I'm doing well.
[36:49.410 --> 36:50.410]  How are you, man?
[36:50.410 --> 36:51.410]  I'm great, man.
[36:51.410 --> 36:52.410]  Thanks for asking.
[36:52.410 --> 36:53.410]  I'm going to turn this music down.
[36:53.410 --> 36:54.410]  I got that real loud.
[36:54.410 --> 36:55.410]  I'm trying to yell over it.
[36:55.410 --> 36:57.410]  I just took a dab and my lungs are doing that fluttery thing they do.
[36:57.410 --> 36:59.410]  I love the intro too.
[36:59.410 --> 37:00.410]  Yeah.
[37:00.410 --> 37:03.410]  We got definitely warmed up before we started recording.
[37:03.410 --> 37:06.410]  We just took some monster dabs of some, that was Gorilla Glue number four.
[37:06.410 --> 37:07.410]  Delicious.
[37:07.410 --> 37:12.410]  Extracted by my good friends, my great friends, my champion friends over at the Garden of Whedon.
[37:12.410 --> 37:13.410]  Big shout out to those guys.
[37:13.410 --> 37:16.410]  Those are some dedicated dabbers at the Garden of Whedon.
[37:16.410 --> 37:17.410]  Yep.
[37:17.410 --> 37:22.410]  They stayed up and stayed in line outside of Illusion's Glass Galleries in Boulder
[37:22.410 --> 37:28.410]  overnight to scoop a new mothership rig, and they got one, and it is sexy.
[37:28.410 --> 37:29.410]  Yeah, it looks pretty dope.
[37:29.410 --> 37:30.410]  I was looking at photos today.
[37:30.410 --> 37:31.410]  Man.
[37:31.410 --> 37:32.410]  Shout out to the Garden of Whedon.
[37:32.410 --> 37:34.410]  That is some dedication right there.
[37:34.410 --> 37:35.410]  Yes, it is.
[37:35.410 --> 37:38.410]  People may say that that mothership rig is a bit excessive, but you know what?
[37:38.410 --> 37:40.410]  I think you guys deserve that shit.
[37:40.410 --> 37:42.410]  Fuck anybody that hates on you for it.
[37:42.410 --> 37:43.410]  They worked for it.
[37:43.410 --> 37:44.410]  They earned it.
[37:44.410 --> 37:45.410]  They did.
[37:45.410 --> 37:46.410]  They earned the hell out of it.
[37:46.410 --> 37:47.410]  They invited me over to check it out.
[37:47.410 --> 37:48.410]  Tomorrow, we'll go take some dabs over there.
[37:48.410 --> 37:49.410]  I like it.
[37:49.410 --> 37:50.410]  We're coming, Spence.
[37:50.410 --> 37:51.410]  Get ready.
[37:51.410 --> 37:53.410]  Maddie, make some cheesecake, dude.
[37:53.410 --> 37:54.410]  We're coming.
[37:54.410 --> 37:55.410]  All right.
[37:55.410 --> 37:56.410]  Where was I in this?
[37:56.410 --> 37:57.410]  Oh, yeah.
[37:57.410 --> 37:59.410]  We got to send a big shout out to Cat and Coot from the Mystic Roots Band before we go too far.
[38:00.410 --> 38:02.410]  Cat and Coot from the Mystic Roots Crew let me use their music on the show.
[38:02.410 --> 38:03.410]  That is really cool.
[38:03.410 --> 38:07.410]  It should cost me a lot of money to play music on a podcast if you do things correctly.
[38:07.410 --> 38:10.410]  But they let me have access to their full library.
[38:10.410 --> 38:13.410]  They emailed me everything, all the instrumental tracks I got at all.
[38:13.410 --> 38:14.410]  It was kind of cool of them.
[38:14.410 --> 38:16.410]  So, big shout out to the Mystic Roots Band.
[38:16.410 --> 38:17.410]  Make sure you check them out.
[38:17.410 --> 38:18.410]  I'm going to burp.
[38:18.410 --> 38:19.410]  Here we go.
[38:19.410 --> 38:20.410]  Get it.
[38:20.410 --> 38:21.410]  I just had to get that out of the way.
[38:21.410 --> 38:22.410]  I was trying to force it down.
[38:22.410 --> 38:23.410]  I needed it out.
[38:23.410 --> 38:27.410]  The organic portions of this podcast are brought to you by my great friends at the Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[38:27.410 --> 38:30.410]  Make sure you check out the Rocky Mountain Worm Company in Colorado Springs, you guys.
[38:30.410 --> 38:35.410]  You can get African Nightcrawlers, Red Wigglers, and all of your organic soil amendments.
[38:35.410 --> 38:40.410]  I'm not sure if they still have the Dragonfly Earth Medicine products in stock by the time you listen to this.
[38:40.410 --> 38:42.410]  But they have for quite a while.
[38:42.410 --> 38:44.410]  They've been selling them like a beast.
[38:44.410 --> 38:45.410]  Get them before they run out.
[38:45.410 --> 38:51.410]  You can use all the worm castings I use by visiting www.RockyMountainWormCompany.com.
[38:51.410 --> 38:56.410]  Or if you're in Colorado Springs, they are at 411 Tijuana Street in Colorado Springs.
[38:56.410 --> 38:59.410]  Make sure you tell them that you learned about them through the podcast.
[38:59.410 --> 39:02.410]  They might show you the worm factory if you ask.
[39:02.410 --> 39:03.410]  The worm farm.
[39:03.410 --> 39:04.410]  It's pretty cool in there.
[39:04.410 --> 39:05.410]  Yep.
[39:05.410 --> 39:06.410]  Check it out, guys.
[39:06.410 --> 39:07.410]  I'll take you with me next time.
[39:07.410 --> 39:11.410]  I'll take Mike with me next time and he can stick his hands in the worm farm and see what goes on in there.
[39:11.410 --> 39:12.410]  It's kind of cool.
[39:12.410 --> 39:15.410]  So big shout out to the sponsor that helps the show happen.
[39:15.410 --> 39:18.410]  If you guys are interested in sponsoring the show, send me an email.
[39:18.410 --> 39:19.410]  It's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[39:19.410 --> 39:21.410]  I'll get you all the information that you need.
[39:21.410 --> 39:27.410]  If you want to leave some comments on Facebook, Twitter, Stitcher, iTunes, all that stuff, I'd really appreciate that.
[39:27.410 --> 39:29.410]  So let's get to the heart of the matter.
[39:29.410 --> 39:32.410]  Actually, I've got to say a couple more things.
[39:32.410 --> 39:34.410]  Shit, I forgot that I've got a whole other pile of notes.
[39:34.410 --> 39:35.410]  Damn, I'm really excited.
[39:35.410 --> 39:36.410]  We've got a big show this time.
[39:36.410 --> 39:40.410]  Yeah, I want to get to the beef of the show because we've got some shit that pissed me off when I read it.
[39:40.410 --> 39:43.410]  I had to have Mike come over and kind of interpret.
[39:43.410 --> 39:46.410]  It's been a week full of some horse shit.
[39:46.410 --> 39:47.410]  I'll agree with that.
[39:47.410 --> 39:48.410]  Yeah, yeah.
[39:48.410 --> 39:51.410]  So the good part of the week on Monday, my good buddy Clint, shout out to Clint.
[39:51.410 --> 39:52.410]  My car has been broke down.
[39:52.410 --> 39:53.410]  Clint called me.
[39:53.410 --> 39:55.410]  He's like, hey, dude, I know you're stuck in the house.
[39:55.410 --> 39:57.410]  Let's go to the 420 Speakeasy in Colorado Springs.
[39:57.410 --> 39:59.410]  I'm going to do some comedy.
[39:59.410 --> 40:02.410]  And so he picked me up, and he took me up to Springs.
[40:02.410 --> 40:05.410]  And the 420 Speakeasy is pretty damn cool, you guys.
[40:05.410 --> 40:07.410]  It cost me $10 to get in there.
[40:07.410 --> 40:08.410]  They checked my ID.
[40:08.410 --> 40:12.410]  And once I walked in, there's a Dab Bar that you can – you don't buy dabs.
[40:12.410 --> 40:13.410]  You buy credits.
[40:13.410 --> 40:19.410]  And then you can trade your credits for dabs or flowers that you consume on site.
[40:19.410 --> 40:25.410]  Or you can trade your credits for Mountain Dew or orange juice or they had ice creams.
[40:25.410 --> 40:26.410]  Ooh.
[40:26.410 --> 40:27.410]  Yeah.
[40:27.410 --> 40:31.410]  So it was a credit system, which we know what's going on there, but good way around some shit.
[40:31.410 --> 40:36.410]  I was welcome to pull out my own rig and my own dabs because I'm kind of a dab snob.
[40:36.410 --> 40:37.410]  I didn't really want to –
[40:37.410 --> 40:39.410]  And most of those places are BYO everything.
[40:39.410 --> 40:40.410]  Yeah, yeah.
[40:40.410 --> 40:41.410]  Or rent glass, but bring your own everything.
[40:41.410 --> 40:44.410]  And they did have sweet rigs for rent.
[40:44.410 --> 40:45.410]  But of course, I show up.
[40:45.410 --> 40:50.410]  I took the Eric Ross 4.0 custom rig, so I had no need for any other rig.
[40:50.410 --> 40:52.410]  And I brought my own Earl with me.
[40:52.410 --> 40:54.410]  So we sat at a booth and just dabbed out.
[40:54.410 --> 40:57.410]  Dustin, Drew, Clint, and myself sat there and dabbed.
[40:57.410 --> 40:58.410]  Clint didn't take any dabs.
[40:58.410 --> 41:00.410]  He's kind of a puss, but he smoked weed with us.
[41:00.410 --> 41:02.410]  He had something to do that night.
[41:02.410 --> 41:05.410]  Yeah, and then he did a set of comedy that was – it was different.
[41:05.410 --> 41:07.410]  Clint had a life-changing event that day.
[41:07.410 --> 41:12.410]  And so the comedy really let that event come out on stage, and that was quite entertaining.
[41:12.410 --> 41:13.410]  Nice.
[41:13.410 --> 41:14.410]  Yeah.
[41:14.410 --> 41:15.410]  Shout-out to Ben Verbeck.
[41:15.410 --> 41:19.410]  He hosts – it's called Comedy Anarchy at the 420 Speakeasy on Mondays.
[41:19.410 --> 41:21.410]  I think it starts at 8.
[41:21.410 --> 41:26.410]  So if you guys want some comedy, you want to go smoke some weed, you want to take some dabs, check that place out.
[41:26.410 --> 41:27.410]  Live up your Monday, people.
[41:27.410 --> 41:28.410]  Yeah, yeah.
[41:28.410 --> 41:29.410]  Get out on a Monday.
[41:29.410 --> 41:30.410]  Go see some funny.
[41:30.410 --> 41:31.410]  Go support my friend Clint.
[41:31.410 --> 41:33.410]  Go support comedy and Ben Verbeck.
[41:33.410 --> 41:34.410]  Yeah.
[41:34.410 --> 41:36.410]  It was fun because you could dab and see comedy.
[41:36.410 --> 41:37.410]  They don't pay me or anything to say that.
[41:37.410 --> 41:39.410]  I just had a good time, wanted to talk about it.
[41:39.410 --> 41:41.410]  It's really cool having a place.
[41:41.410 --> 41:47.410]  I wasn't at home, and I was with a few of my bros, and I was meeting new bros, just taking dabs and kicking back.
[41:47.410 --> 41:51.410]  And it was open-mic comedy, so there was moments of free entertainment.
[41:51.410 --> 41:53.410]  Moments.
[41:53.410 --> 41:55.410]  So go to the 420 Speakeasy.
[41:55.410 --> 41:56.410]  It was fun.
[41:56.410 --> 41:57.410]  That's my point.
[41:57.410 --> 41:58.410]  Check it out, folks.
[41:58.410 --> 42:02.410]  Also, somebody sent me an email asking me – they want to add another light to their room,
[42:03.410 --> 42:06.410]  and they wanted to know what the best type of light would be in their situation.
[42:06.410 --> 42:12.410]  Right now, the light I would recommend would be a Govita for almost any situation other than a tent.
[42:12.410 --> 42:16.410]  If you've got a room and you're trying to put new lights in there, go Govitas.
[42:16.410 --> 42:17.410]  Those are sweet.
[42:17.410 --> 42:21.410]  The double-ended bulb technology will push your plants to another level.
[42:21.410 --> 42:23.410]  So I hope that answers your question there, dude.
[42:23.410 --> 42:24.410]  Get a Govita.
[42:24.410 --> 42:25.410]  I emailed you.
[42:25.410 --> 42:27.410]  I hope you respond to the email also.
[42:27.410 --> 42:29.410]  I want to brag about something.
[42:29.410 --> 42:36.410]  On Stitcher, we have reached a peak rank of 748th out of 40,000 shows.
[42:36.410 --> 42:37.410]  Way to go, man.
[42:37.410 --> 42:38.410]  Thank you, bro.
[42:38.410 --> 42:40.410]  That's a lot of listens, you guys.
[42:40.410 --> 42:42.410]  That's spectacular, especially through Stitcher.
[42:42.410 --> 42:43.410]  Yeah.
[42:43.410 --> 42:45.410]  Just Stitcher alone on Mondays, you guys are listening.
[42:45.410 --> 42:49.410]  You download the show, 5,000 downloads on Monday morning.
[42:49.410 --> 42:50.410]  Keep it up, everybody.
[42:50.410 --> 42:51.410]  Yeah.
[42:51.410 --> 42:52.410]  Thank you, guys.
[42:52.410 --> 42:55.410]  I want to thank everybody that downloads it on Stitcher, iTunes, and the website.
[42:55.410 --> 42:57.410]  I appreciate that.
[42:57.410 --> 43:00.410]  We moved up in the ranks on Stitcher quite dramatically.
[43:00.410 --> 43:05.410]  In the health and lifestyle category, we were ranked number 59 this week.
[43:05.410 --> 43:06.410]  Man.
[43:06.410 --> 43:14.410]  I think that that is because of me being a guest speaker on the medical marijuana radio show about a week ago with LS Love.
[43:14.410 --> 43:16.410]  He definitely plugged my show heavily.
[43:16.410 --> 43:17.410]  Sends some traffic your way.
[43:17.410 --> 43:18.410]  Nice.
[43:18.410 --> 43:20.410]  So I want to send a huge, huge shout-out to LS Love.
[43:20.410 --> 43:25.410]  If you don't already listen to it, make sure you go listen to medical marijuana radio with LS Love.
[43:26.410 --> 43:27.410]  It's on YouTube.
[43:27.410 --> 43:29.410]  I have not found it on iTunes.
[43:29.410 --> 43:32.410]  I think I'm going to help him get his show on iTunes because that's what he really needs.
[43:32.410 --> 43:33.410]  Step him up a little bit?
[43:33.410 --> 43:35.410]  Yeah, just teach him about that.
[43:35.410 --> 43:36.410]  So shout-out to LS Love.
[43:36.410 --> 43:38.410]  Thank you, guys, for listening, dude.
[43:38.410 --> 43:39.410]  Oh, my God.
[43:39.410 --> 43:41.410]  5,000 people just on Stitcher?
[43:41.410 --> 43:42.410]  That is crazy.
[43:42.410 --> 43:43.410]  Dude, thanks for the love, everybody.
[43:43.410 --> 43:47.410]  That means another 5,000 on iTunes and probably another half of that on my website.
[43:47.410 --> 43:48.410]  So we're getting—
[43:48.410 --> 43:49.410]  Right.
[43:49.410 --> 43:50.410]  I downloaded straight off the website.
[43:50.410 --> 43:53.410]  So I've just got it on my phone to play whatever when I'm rolling.
[43:54.410 --> 43:55.410]  And that's just—
[43:55.410 --> 43:56.410]  Stitcher it up.
[43:56.410 --> 43:58.410]  Stitcher shows me on Mondays that 5,000 people listen.
[43:58.410 --> 43:59.410]  Nice.
[43:59.410 --> 44:00.410]  Yeah, just on Monday.
[44:00.410 --> 44:01.410]  That's crazy.
[44:01.410 --> 44:02.410]  So thank you, guys.
[44:02.410 --> 44:05.410]  All 5,000 of you that listen on Monday, everybody that listens through the week, thank you, guys.
[44:05.410 --> 44:06.410]  I hope you're in your garden.
[44:06.410 --> 44:09.410]  I hope you're driving to work, and I hope I'm making your garden time, your work time.
[44:09.410 --> 44:11.410]  Maybe you're stuck in a cubicle.
[44:11.410 --> 44:13.410]  If you're stuck in that cubicle, I know you know who I'm talking to.
[44:13.410 --> 44:15.410]  I hope I'm making your day better.
[44:15.410 --> 44:17.410]  So we did that.
[44:17.410 --> 44:20.410]  We're going to get to the news, I promise, but I want to talk about one more thing.
[44:21.410 --> 44:26.410]  I am a supporter of a company called Grassroots California.
[44:26.410 --> 44:28.410]  They make these stylish hats that I wear.
[44:28.410 --> 44:30.410]  They make some pretty cool clothing.
[44:30.410 --> 44:32.410]  I'm a fan as well.
[44:32.410 --> 44:33.410]  Well, right on.
[44:33.410 --> 44:36.410]  The company Grassroots has a store in Denver.
[44:36.410 --> 44:38.410]  We've got to get you a Grassroots hat, dude.
[44:38.410 --> 44:39.410]  We do.
[44:39.410 --> 44:40.410]  Get this beanie off my head.
[44:40.410 --> 44:41.410]  People will thank you.
[44:41.410 --> 44:46.410]  He's been wearing a beanie since I met him through the summer, through the winter, for like seven years.
[44:46.410 --> 44:47.410]  Shout out to Ashley.
[44:47.410 --> 44:48.410]  Hell of a beanie.
[44:49.410 --> 44:53.410]  I've been promised she's going to visit here sometime in the next year and make me a new one.
[44:53.410 --> 44:55.410]  So we're never going to get you a hat.
[44:55.410 --> 44:56.410]  It's just going to be a beanie forever.
[44:56.410 --> 44:57.410]  He looks good on you.
[44:57.410 --> 44:58.410]  We're not going to change you.
[44:58.410 --> 45:01.410]  So the guys at Grassroots, shout out to Ryan.
[45:01.410 --> 45:04.410]  He's the owner and founder of Grassroots California.
[45:04.410 --> 45:05.410]  They're a hat company.
[45:05.410 --> 45:06.410]  They support the cannabis movement.
[45:06.410 --> 45:11.410]  They host the 710 Cup, which is a dab festival where it's a dab competition.
[45:11.410 --> 45:14.410]  But they opened a business called The Break Room.
[45:14.410 --> 45:18.410]  What The Break Room was was a smoking lounge that you could bring your own.
[45:18.410 --> 45:24.410]  They didn't sell anything there, but you had to bring your own hat, your own flowers, and you could hang out in this building and socialize and smoke.
[45:24.410 --> 45:28.410]  And they had games and activities to do to keep you entertained and snacks, of course.
[45:28.410 --> 45:34.410]  So on 420, the Denver police raided The Break Room.
[45:34.410 --> 45:38.410]  They weren't the only ones raided, but they were among those raided on 420.
[45:38.410 --> 45:41.410]  There was a huge sweep on 420, which, come on, cops, it's a dick move, bro.
[45:41.410 --> 45:43.410]  Come on.
[45:43.410 --> 45:47.410]  Our rape solve rate is still at like 40% of people.
[45:47.410 --> 45:48.410]  Yeah, but-
[45:48.410 --> 45:50.410]  We're raiding speakeasies.
[45:50.410 --> 45:56.410]  Yeah, so they go in and they raid The Break Room, and they shut the place down.
[45:56.410 --> 46:01.410]  And in turn, they shut down the Grassroots store.
[46:01.410 --> 46:04.410]  But the Grassroots store is a separate business.
[46:04.410 --> 46:06.410]  In a separate, the store is divided.
[46:06.410 --> 46:10.410]  There is a separate staff, a separate cash register, a separate entrance.
[46:10.410 --> 46:11.410]  Right.
[46:11.410 --> 46:15.410]  And since it's Ryan's store and everything, they shut down both buildings.
[46:15.410 --> 46:25.410]  And now they are forcing, the city of Denver is kind of strong-arm forcing the owner of the building to evict Ryan from their prime location on Larimer, where they've never had a problem.
[46:25.410 --> 46:26.410]  Right.
[46:26.410 --> 46:28.410]  They've got such good sales there because of their location.
[46:28.410 --> 46:30.410]  It's a sweet spot.
[46:30.410 --> 46:31.410]  They've never done anything wrong.
[46:31.410 --> 46:39.410]  And now this dude that has put his life into this company to make these sweet hats that I wear, and that you guys probably wear if you're a part of the movement and you listen to this show.
[46:39.410 --> 46:42.410]  I'm sure one out of ten of you guys has got a Grassroots hat on right now.
[46:42.410 --> 46:48.410]  He's going to be forced to move out of that building and find another building, which is going to be hard because everybody already knows.
[46:48.410 --> 46:49.410]  It's crazy hard.
[46:49.410 --> 46:50.410]  Oh, they know who he's going to be.
[46:50.410 --> 46:51.410]  They don't want him there now.
[46:51.410 --> 46:54.410]  They're going to say no because you're going to open another pot business and you're going to break the rules.
[46:54.410 --> 46:58.410]  So, you guys, he's got a GoFundMe and all kinds of crowdsourcing.
[46:58.410 --> 46:59.410]  It would be really cool.
[46:59.410 --> 47:03.410]  I'm not going to beg for Ryan, but support Ryan any way that you can.
[47:03.410 --> 47:05.410]  Talk to your council people in Denver.
[47:05.410 --> 47:07.410]  Talk to the Denver City attorneys.
[47:07.410 --> 47:08.410]  Let them know that you think it's bullshit.
[47:08.410 --> 47:12.410]  Your opinion does matter, and if they hear it enough, it might make a difference.
[47:12.410 --> 47:16.410]  If this is the first time we're asking you to get involved tonight, it won't be the last.
[47:16.410 --> 47:20.410]  Yes, Mike definitely needs you to get off the couch and help us do things.
[47:20.410 --> 47:21.410]  It's not just me, man.
[47:21.410 --> 47:25.410]  Every cannabis consumer needs every other cannabis consumer to stand the fuck up.
[47:25.410 --> 47:26.410]  That's the truth.
[47:26.410 --> 47:33.410]  We slept a little bit on some voting, and it looks like we got fucked by sleeping because I'm going to read you some shit in just a minute that you're going to say, wait, that happened?
[47:33.410 --> 47:35.410]  There's lots of fugly headed up later in the show.
[47:35.410 --> 47:36.410]  Sorry.
[47:36.410 --> 47:37.410]  Stay tuned.
[47:37.410 --> 47:40.410]  All right, so let's get into those news articles that we've been talking about.
[47:40.410 --> 47:42.410]  I'm going to take a quick small drink of this here.
[47:42.410 --> 47:44.410]  You take a drink, and then we'll get into some news.
[47:44.410 --> 47:45.410]  Chug it.
[47:47.410 --> 47:48.410]  All right.
[47:48.410 --> 47:50.410]  I'm nice and hydrated now.
[47:50.410 --> 47:52.410]  I'm looking for this news article.
[47:52.410 --> 47:54.410]  I've got so many things on the screen.
[47:54.410 --> 47:57.410]  It's been a big week in Colorado news.
[47:57.410 --> 47:58.410]  Yeah, let's start with this one.
[47:58.410 --> 48:00.410]  This one's from the Westward.
[48:00.410 --> 48:03.410]  The headline is Medical Marijuana Crackdown Bill, Now Law.
[48:03.410 --> 48:05.410]  More about money than safety.
[48:05.410 --> 48:07.410]  And the article is by Michael Roberts.
[48:07.410 --> 48:09.410]  And it goes like this.
[48:09.410 --> 48:17.410]  Today, Governor John Hickenlooper signed Senate Bill 15-014, which has been characterized as a medical pot crackdown bill.
[48:17.410 --> 48:29.410]  Among other things, the legislation will empower a board in consultation with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to establish guidelines for physicians making medical marijuana recommendations.
[48:29.410 --> 48:43.410]  The provision is backed by those like Aguilar who doubt that most medical marijuana cardholders receiving recommendations for treatment of severe pain, a group that makes up approximately 93% of the total, actually suffer from this condition.
[48:43.410 --> 48:46.410]  Now, we'll take a minute to bitch about this.
[48:46.410 --> 48:48.410]  There's a lot of stuff in there.
[48:49.410 --> 49:00.410]  First, the 93% of Colorado medical marijuana cardholders list chronic and severe pain as one of their qualifying conditions.
[49:00.410 --> 49:05.410]  If you add all of the qualifying conditions up, you get way more than 100%.
[49:05.410 --> 49:10.410]  And it's because a lot of people list that along with cancer, AIDS, MS.
[49:10.410 --> 49:11.410]  Kachexia is one of the major ones.
[49:11.410 --> 49:13.410]  Right, Crohn's.
[49:13.410 --> 49:19.410]  There's countless other ailments on the list of qualifying conditions that cause severe pain.
[49:19.410 --> 49:26.410]  And so, pretty much everyone with a medical marijuana card in Colorado also includes severe pain when they're signing up with their doctor.
[49:26.410 --> 49:36.410]  What the legislature has done in the theory, I guess, for several years has been that that 97% number is the fakers.
[49:37.410 --> 49:52.410]  And so, when people, I suppose, park in outside dispensaries across the street and watch people come and go every day, there were all kinds of people claiming they did this regularly right after we legalized, right after the medical expansion.
[49:52.410 --> 49:57.410]  You can't tell what's wrong with me by the way I walk from my car to the dispensary.
[49:57.410 --> 50:01.410]  Right, you can't see my nerve damage from 20 yards away.
[50:01.410 --> 50:04.410]  You can't see that, yeah, I don't even need to talk about it.
[50:04.410 --> 50:07.410]  I have plenty of medical conditions we could talk about.
[50:07.410 --> 50:12.410]  My pain is one of them, but I shouldn't even have to say what's wrong with me.
[50:12.410 --> 50:17.410]  I've got a medical marijuana card and it's really not that detective or that nosy person's business what my problem is.
[50:18.410 --> 50:32.410]  Right, so these people have decided that that 97% number is probably all of the fakers in Colorado, which is like 97,000 people because there's roughly 100,000 people on the registry right now.
[50:32.410 --> 50:33.410]  Wow.
[50:33.410 --> 50:38.410]  So, they're assuming roughly 97,000 people are basically faking.
[50:38.410 --> 50:46.410]  And this bill is a big attempt to push as many of them as they can back into the rec market where we're paying 22% more taxes.
[50:46.410 --> 50:48.410]  Yeah, let me get into the article because you're going to blow this guy's whole paper.
[50:48.410 --> 50:51.410]  This guy wrote an article and you just fucking shot it all down for him.
[50:51.410 --> 50:54.410]  You just buried the lead for this guy that took time on this article.
[50:54.410 --> 50:58.410]  No, it says, but is this new rule more about safety or money?
[50:58.410 --> 51:02.410]  Even though 15-014 is now law, the debate continues to rage.
[51:02.410 --> 51:11.410]  The highest profile backer of the bill was Senator Irene Aguilar, whose website lists her as Senator Irene Aguilar, MD, and stresses her own medical background.
[51:12.410 --> 51:20.410]  So, what Mike was getting at is they're trying to make it harder for you to get a medical marijuana card for your pain.
[51:20.410 --> 51:30.410]  And we suspect that it's to drive you to the recreational dispensaries where taxes are higher and you've got to spend more money and pay more taxes and the state makes more money.
[51:30.410 --> 51:37.410]  Because a lot of the things that we see going on in this bill are all about the taxes and the money and fuck the patients and the caregivers.
[51:37.410 --> 51:40.410]  Yeah, this is a long bill and it does several things.
[51:40.410 --> 51:47.410]  And I think if you take a look at it as a whole, all of the things it does are designed to push people off of the medical registry and into the rec market.
[51:47.410 --> 51:54.410]  The next paragraph in this article just is an excerpt from this lady's website and basically it brags and says, I'm too cool for you.
[51:54.410 --> 51:57.410]  It talks about all the places she went to school and her qualifications.
[51:57.410 --> 51:58.410]  You guys don't care.
[51:59.410 --> 52:07.410]  Then it goes on to say, will the bill's new guidelines make it more difficult for physicians to recommend medical marijuana to those who say they are plagued by severe pain?
[52:07.410 --> 52:16.410]  If so, longtime Westward marijuana writer William Breeds fears some patients who really need MMJ will be deprived of the recommendations.
[52:16.410 --> 52:20.410]  And then here's an excerpt from another article he wrote in March that says,
[52:21.410 --> 52:30.410]  Studies show that as many as 100 million Americans suffer from chronic pain and that it affects more people than diabetes, coronary heart disease and cancer combined.
[52:30.410 --> 52:39.410]  According to the American Academy of Pain Medicine, 20% of all American adults experience chronic pain severe enough to disrupt their sleep at least two times per week.
[52:39.410 --> 52:51.410]  The number of patients on the Colorado Medical Marijuana Registry who claim severe pain is around 105,500 people, just below 2% of the total population of the state.
[52:51.410 --> 52:59.410]  The fact that 1.9% of the state's residents experience chronic pain and have turned to cannabis to help is hardly surprising or shocking.
[52:59.410 --> 53:10.410]  So, Breeds also notes that the assorted lawmakers in favor of the proposals have made it clear that the measure is a way to improve some medical marijuana patient.
[53:10.410 --> 53:22.410]  Oh, sorry, I read that wrong. A way to move some medical marijuana patients into recreational pot sales, which are taxed at higher rates than medical pot sales in order to generate valuable tax revenue for state and local governments.
[53:23.410 --> 53:32.410]  The difference between the amount of tax revenue generated by the recreational marijuana versus medical cannabis are stark, as we pointed out last week in a post about rec pots.
[53:32.410 --> 53:34.410]  So, yeah, we talked about how much the taxes are.
[53:34.410 --> 53:41.410]  Then they show a graph here that shows state of Colorado medical marijuana sales tax for the month of March.
[53:41.410 --> 53:48.410]  And then it shows, this is medical in Adams County. Let's see, let's find Pueblo. This is where we are. Let's go to Pueblo.
[53:49.410 --> 53:57.410]  They did $14,904 in the month of March. Now, let's go down to look at the same thing, Pueblo.
[54:01.410 --> 54:07.410]  The additional 10% sales tax brought in $135,215.
[54:07.410 --> 54:14.410]  So, yeah, they just want to move you right over to that rec market so that you got to spend that extra $135,000.
[54:15.410 --> 54:18.410]  Oh, that's rude. That's a dick move.
[54:18.410 --> 54:23.410]  They were working on this three years ago, and then they sort of dropped it last year.
[54:23.410 --> 54:29.410]  And the hype was that a whole bunch of people were going to join the medical marijuana registry to avoid the taxes.
[54:29.410 --> 54:34.410]  And when that didn't happen, they brought up the severe pain number again and said, well, let's push more of those people out.
[54:34.410 --> 54:36.410]  Why don't that?
[54:36.410 --> 54:47.410]  It's part of the data collection. When they saw that the medical marijuana market consumed like 65 or 70% of the $700 million worth of marijuana sold in Colorado last year, they kind of freaked.
[54:47.410 --> 54:53.410]  What they don't get is that direct consumers consume occasionally, recreationally.
[54:53.410 --> 54:57.410]  Medical consumers consume daily for medical reasons. Of course, we're consuming the majority of the meds.
[54:57.410 --> 55:00.410]  Yeah. And that's what this was designed for.
[55:01.410 --> 55:06.410]  I keep going back to this part, but we put cannabis on the legal market here for medical patients.
[55:06.410 --> 55:09.410]  That's how the model started. And now that's who we have screwed over.
[55:09.410 --> 55:12.410]  That's who's getting pushed right out of all of this.
[55:12.410 --> 55:14.410]  They're getting attacked from every angle.
[55:14.410 --> 55:20.410]  The state's taking money out of the registry that they're not supposed to access and spending it on stuff they're not supposed to spend it on.
[55:20.410 --> 55:27.410]  They're looking to make it harder to get an extended plant count to get a recommendation for severe pain.
[55:27.410 --> 55:31.410]  They're looking to limit caregivers in a half dozen different ways. We're going to talk about in a little bit.
[55:31.410 --> 55:33.410]  Yeah, we'll talk about that in just a second.
[55:33.410 --> 55:38.410]  It's getting tough to be a medical patient in Colorado if you don't really keep up on your stuff.
[55:38.410 --> 55:41.410]  And it's going to be especially harder to be a caregiver here pretty soon.
[55:41.410 --> 55:47.410]  All right. I've got another article on the screen. It's very similar to the one that we just read, but it goes on a different direction toward the end.
[55:47.410 --> 55:52.410]  It's about the same law. It's just such a big law that there's several different news articles on it.
[55:52.410 --> 55:54.410]  Yeah, and then we're going to read part of the new bill.
[55:54.410 --> 55:59.410]  Actually, I have the PDF on my screen. We'll read part of that bill in just a minute, too.
[55:59.410 --> 56:02.410]  And the headline alone will be enough to make you understand why we're so frustrated.
[56:02.410 --> 56:04.410]  And we'll read some parts from that bill.
[56:04.410 --> 56:08.410]  So it says this article is actually written by Kristen Wyatt and I founded on the cannabis.
[56:08.410 --> 56:12.410]  I think Mike sent me a link to this. Thanks for that. That's why I called you to be on the show.
[56:12.410 --> 56:13.410]  Thanks.
[56:13.410 --> 56:18.410]  The headline is Colorado Medical Pot, New Caregiver Limits, MMJ in Schools, OK'd by Government.
[56:18.410 --> 56:20.410]  What? Yeah, I'll read it. Don't worry.
[56:20.410 --> 56:24.410]  It says Colorado's governor signed into law a crackdown on medical marijuana.
[56:24.410 --> 56:31.410]  That's a fucking tongue twister. Medical Marijuana Monday. That's a whole new. We should just make that something right there.
[56:31.410 --> 56:33.410]  Medical Marijuana Mondays. I like that.
[56:33.410 --> 56:38.410]  I'm going to start over, though. Colorado's governor signed into law a crackdown on medical marijuana Monday.
[56:38.410 --> 56:43.410]  One of two measures designed to ferret out people improperly using and selling untaxed marijuana.
[56:43.410 --> 56:47.410]  I think that we need an Oxford comma in this sentence right here after the word marijuana.
[56:47.410 --> 56:49.410]  I think that would fix this.
[56:49.410 --> 56:51.410]  I think I'm the wrong guy to ask that question.
[56:51.410 --> 56:56.410]  But then it says the law limits caregivers, those who grow pot on behalf of patients to ninety nine plants.
[56:56.410 --> 57:04.410]  The change means that some high volume caregivers will face the same oversight as commercial growers, paying licensing fees and undergrowing background checks.
[57:04.410 --> 57:10.410]  The new rule in Senate 14, Senate Bill 14, have support from the recreational pot industry,
[57:10.410 --> 57:17.410]  which has complained that the light regulation on Colorado's caregivers has invited black market growers who don't face residency requirements,
[57:17.410 --> 57:24.410]  or commercial seed to sale tracking used to ensure pot plants are grown and sold legally.
[57:24.410 --> 57:30.410]  A lot of those people just have to grow cannabis either way, like they're going to grow their own.
[57:30.410 --> 57:36.410]  Black market production people just do. They have forever.
[57:36.410 --> 57:43.410]  If they're moving here to Colorado, it's to hide amongst the many like those idiots doing those warehouses in Denver.
[57:43.410 --> 57:51.410]  They stood out like a sore thumb because they weren't operating legally and it was clear to everyone around them that they were about to get busted and then they were quickly busted.
[57:53.410 --> 57:56.410]  There's so many things I want to rant about here.
[57:56.410 --> 58:00.410]  At least one thing that they did that was cool is they left it at ninety nine plants.
[58:00.410 --> 58:02.410]  If you've got more than that, you're doing something weird anyway.
[58:02.410 --> 58:08.410]  But fees and background checks, we would open our own dispensary if we wanted background checks and fees.
[58:08.410 --> 58:12.410]  That's why we're just a caregiver. We're just low key growing a little bit of cannabis for somebody.
[58:12.410 --> 58:16.410]  Dispensaries make money. Caregivers can't.
[58:16.410 --> 58:25.410]  Part of the beauty of the caregiver system is there's a huge number of people in Colorado that can't afford to be spending four or five hundred dollars a week on medicine.
[58:25.410 --> 58:31.410]  Without caregivers, I don't know a lot of people that could manage their pain.
[58:31.410 --> 58:37.410]  I know several people that would be shit out of luck if I couldn't grow their medicine for them or supply their medicine in some way, shape or form.
[58:38.410 --> 58:45.410]  It's a huge thing. The cost savings when you go through a caregiver is significant over trying to shop and even the medical dispensaries.
[58:45.410 --> 58:50.410]  Getting rid of the caregivers pushes more people into the medical legal system, the shops.
[58:50.410 --> 58:52.410]  I don't know. I hate this bill so much.
[58:52.410 --> 58:53.410]  Me too. Me too.
[58:53.410 --> 59:02.410]  The article goes on to say, we're really trying to make sure that caregivers are part of our regulatory system, said Representative Jonathan Singer from Longmont, who sponsored the bill.
[59:02.410 --> 59:09.410]  Caregivers have successfully resisted such limits for years, but the law includes some concessions that won their acceptance.
[59:09.410 --> 59:19.410]  For example, the law eliminates an unenforced requirement that parents of marijuana patients under 18 grow the drug.
[59:19.410 --> 59:24.410]  So that means that now, back in the day, if you were under 18 and you were a patient, your parents had to grow for you.
[59:24.410 --> 59:27.410]  You couldn't assign a caregiver. You couldn't shop at the dispensary.
[59:27.410 --> 59:30.410]  Now that kind of changes the rules there. So that kind of helps.
[59:31.410 --> 59:32.410]  The rule had...
[59:32.410 --> 59:38.410]  There's two not horrible parts of this bill. You could even call them decent, and that's definitely one of them.
[59:38.410 --> 59:39.410]  True. Yeah.
[59:39.410 --> 59:46.410]  The rule puts in parents who move to Colorado seeking cannabis treatments for their children outside the law, and now those folks will be legal. So that helps a lot.
[59:46.410 --> 59:53.410]  It also sets up a task force to start work on public access to the state's few marijuana testing labs.
[59:53.410 --> 59:58.410]  So the marijuana industry has generally opposed public access to the labs, fearing backlogs.
[59:58.410 --> 01:00:02.410]  That's some horseshit, ain't it? Just let that sentence stick in for a minute.
[01:00:02.410 --> 01:00:11.410]  The industry is fighting letting caregivers access testing labs because it might take them an extra day to get their test results.
[01:00:11.410 --> 01:00:14.410]  And they don't want business.
[01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:19.410]  Right? Why aren't the labs standing up asking for more business? It just doesn't make any sense.
[01:00:19.410 --> 01:00:25.410]  Yeah. And my medicine needs to be tested just as badly as the dispensary's does or whoever else's bill.
[01:00:25.410 --> 01:00:30.410]  That dumb rule came down what, after one batch of tests you got in?
[01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:35.410]  Yeah. Yeah. I got one or two good batches of testing in before they shut that down so that I couldn't do it anymore.
[01:00:35.410 --> 01:00:40.410]  All right. There's so much stuff in this article, you guys. I might skip a couple of paragraphs.
[01:00:40.410 --> 01:00:41.410]  Finally, this one is good.
[01:00:41.410 --> 01:00:52.410]  The law allows school districts to consider allowing medical marijuana use on campus as long as the pot is administered by a parent or designated medical marijuana professional, not a school nurse.
[01:00:52.410 --> 01:00:59.410]  The pot in school's allowance would be the nation's first, though it's not clear how many school districts would participate.
[01:00:59.410 --> 01:01:03.410]  Nor would it allow any sort of smoked consumption.
[01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:04.410]  Yeah. I didn't think so.
[01:01:04.410 --> 01:01:09.410]  It's capsules, oils, tinctures, lotions only. But still, it's a huge step in the right direction.
[01:01:09.410 --> 01:01:14.410]  Yeah. Well, because a kid that's got ADD or whatever else that requires a medicine that day.
[01:01:14.410 --> 01:01:16.410]  There are hundreds of kids that have moved to Colorado.
[01:01:17.410 --> 01:01:22.410]  I'm just saying if you take a pill, if you take a prescription, you go to the school nurse after lunch and she gives you your pill.
[01:01:22.410 --> 01:01:26.410]  Why can't you just go in there and get your ganja cookie or your Sweet Stone candy bear or something?
[01:01:26.410 --> 01:01:33.410]  They're skirting federal law again and being silly, but it's a step in the right direction at least.
[01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:36.410]  It's a very tiny possible step in the right direction.
[01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:38.410]  Small steps. Baby steps.
[01:01:38.410 --> 01:01:46.410]  It goes on to say, Governor Hickenlooper said the law was a compromise worked out by both political parties and the pot industry and caregivers.
[01:01:46.410 --> 01:01:50.410]  The news went apeshit with this particular amendment the last couple of weeks.
[01:01:50.410 --> 01:01:54.410]  Pot in schools. The anti-pot people had a big hit.
[01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:59.410]  Yeah. I'm in the cannabis industry. I've seen this since the beginning.
[01:01:59.410 --> 01:02:04.410]  We had a shot. Mike was the bud tender and I was the manager at the very first dispensary in this little town.
[01:02:05.410 --> 01:02:09.410]  I'm still surprised they're going to let the kids use their edibles or whatever in school.
[01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:11.410]  That's just, that's revolutionary.
[01:02:11.410 --> 01:02:18.410]  We've literally had hundreds of kids move to Colorado to access this as a medication and all of them have to go to school.
[01:02:18.410 --> 01:02:22.410]  It's just one of the things that we need to find a good workaround for.
[01:02:22.410 --> 01:02:24.410]  I hope this works.
[01:02:24.410 --> 01:02:28.410]  It's a big step. It's a pretty good reflection of what the community wants, Hickenlooper said.
[01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:44.410]  If the law doesn't require caregivers to register their growing operations, instead it encourages them to register by assuring them that authorities could verify their number of plants without starting a criminal investigation instead of forcing caregivers to prove in court that their operation is legal.
[01:02:44.410 --> 01:02:48.410]  That sort of makes sense, but it also seems...
[01:02:49.410 --> 01:02:50.410]  Haven't we seen this move before?
[01:02:50.410 --> 01:02:59.410]  All of you folk of a certain type need to register so that we know where all of you are, that when we want to round all of those certain folk up, we know where they are?
[01:02:59.410 --> 01:03:10.410]  Right. It's a really backwards provision where they're saying to keep from looking guilty, stand up and prove you're innocent first.
[01:03:10.410 --> 01:03:17.410]  Any caregiver who's operating legally answers the cop at the door with a binder full of paperwork.
[01:03:17.410 --> 01:03:21.410]  If the cop can add, there's no difficult questions.
[01:03:21.410 --> 01:03:23.410]  We're lucky because of where we live.
[01:03:23.410 --> 01:03:25.410]  The cops will come and they'll say, you grow weed here?
[01:03:25.410 --> 01:03:27.410]  You go, yeah, I got a couple of plants.
[01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:28.410]  They'll go, you got a medical card?
[01:03:28.410 --> 01:03:29.410]  You go, yeah.
[01:03:29.410 --> 01:03:30.410]  They go, okay, I've got so much other shit to do.
[01:03:30.410 --> 01:03:31.410]  You guys have a good day.
[01:03:31.410 --> 01:03:32.410]  Don't stab anybody.
[01:03:32.410 --> 01:03:33.410]  Then they leave.
[01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:45.410]  But for people in other towns, yeah, that maybe if you've got, if you're in a nice residential area and you stank it out, maybe it'd be a good idea just to go register, just to be proactive.
[01:03:45.410 --> 01:03:48.410]  Now that this bill has been passed, it would be a good idea.
[01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:52.410]  And they require it if you're doing more than six plant minimums.
[01:03:52.410 --> 01:03:54.410]  You guys are going to have to read this bill.
[01:03:54.410 --> 01:04:00.410]  If you're a caregiver, you need to hop online and download the PDF of this bill and read every word.
[01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:02.410]  It's short, so don't be intimidated.
[01:04:02.410 --> 01:04:03.410]  Just read it.
[01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:04.410]  Yep, just do it.
[01:04:04.410 --> 01:04:08.410]  Get yourself a little pen and paper, make some bullet points of what you've got to do now.
[01:04:08.410 --> 01:04:14.410]  So Hickenlooper signed the measure at a Denver police station to show goodwill between law enforcement and caregivers.
[01:04:14.410 --> 01:04:19.410]  The language in the law came after years of testing negotiations between medical marijuana groups and police.
[01:04:19.410 --> 01:04:27.410]  There are good reasons for all sides to not trust each other, said Terry Robnett, head of the Cannabis Patients Alliance, who helped negotiate the language.
[01:04:27.410 --> 01:04:32.410]  The governor has yet to sign the other medical marijuana law that measures upstate...
[01:04:32.410 --> 01:04:39.410]  That measure updates marijuana regulations that were written before Colorado made pot legal for adults in 2012.
[01:04:39.410 --> 01:04:43.410]  So there's a lot of stuff going on in this bill, like we were saying, you guys.
[01:04:43.410 --> 01:04:47.410]  I'm going to find the bill. I've got it on my... I've got the PDF here. I'm going to open it up.
[01:04:47.410 --> 01:04:51.410]  There are a couple things that really got Mike's attention and my attention.
[01:04:52.410 --> 01:05:03.410]  It starts off and it says, a bill for an act. The headline is, concerning marijuana issues that are not regulated by the Department of Revenue.
[01:05:03.410 --> 01:05:09.410]  So they're basically, they're starting off by saying, money, this is shit that we're not getting money from.
[01:05:09.410 --> 01:05:13.410]  Here's money swimming by that we're not catching. That's what it sounds like they're saying to me.
[01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:20.410]  These are the people we can't monitor and overtax. And here are the ways we've found to rectify that.
[01:05:20.410 --> 01:05:31.410]  So the first part is marijuana revenue. Okay, this bill requires the Colorado Medical Board to adopt rules regarding guidelines for physicians who make medical marijuana recommendations for patients suffering from severe pain.
[01:05:31.410 --> 01:05:37.410]  They want to find a new way to figure out if you really hurt or not.
[01:05:37.410 --> 01:05:47.410]  Yep, they've decided that your doctor isn't qualified to believe you and you're not qualified to tell your doctor what hurts.
[01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:54.410]  And so they're going to come up with a little sheet or some paperwork so that the doctor can verify that you really do hurt.
[01:05:54.410 --> 01:05:59.410]  And you can verify that your doctor is sure that you hurt. It's asinine.
[01:05:59.410 --> 01:06:03.410]  Yeah, it hurts. Trust me. Yep. I wouldn't say it hurts if it didn't.
[01:06:03.410 --> 01:06:09.410]  It goes on. It says, the bill requires Colorado Medical Board to adopt rules regarding guidelines for...
[01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:23.410]  No, wait, I already read that. Here we go. It requires the state agency to adopt rules regarding guidelines for primary caregivers to give informed consent to patients that the product they cultivate or produce may contain contaminants and that the levels of THC are not verified.
[01:06:23.410 --> 01:06:26.410]  So, hey, Mike, as your caregiver, did you hear all that?
[01:06:26.410 --> 01:06:27.410]  I did.
[01:06:27.410 --> 01:06:29.410]  I haven't tested any of this.
[01:06:29.410 --> 01:06:31.410]  That's what the warning label on my last pickup says.
[01:06:31.410 --> 01:06:40.410]  I am giving you informed consent to my patient that the product I have cultivated or produced may contain contaminants and that the THC levels are not verified.
[01:06:40.410 --> 01:06:44.410]  Yeah, I didn't put any contaminants on there.
[01:06:44.410 --> 01:06:50.410]  I knew that because I watched the state take away your right to verify your THC levels.
[01:06:50.410 --> 01:06:53.410]  Yeah. Well, we got it back now with this bill, at least.
[01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:59.410]  They're going to put together a group of people to decide how and if you get access. It's not quite the same thing.
[01:06:59.410 --> 01:07:02.410]  Yeah, if I get access. Can we let him play?
[01:07:02.410 --> 01:07:03.410]  It's a big if.
[01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:11.410]  So, the bill requires all primary caregivers to register with the state health agency and the state medical marijuana licensing authority.
[01:07:11.410 --> 01:07:17.410]  Any primary caregiver who is not registered shall register within 10 days of being informed of the duty to register.
[01:07:17.410 --> 01:07:27.410]  If a person fails to register after such 10 days, the state health agency and licensing authority shall prohibit the person from ever registering and acting as a primary caregiver.
[01:07:28.410 --> 01:07:33.410]  They didn't have a stick to whack at you with some of their other rules.
[01:07:33.410 --> 01:07:38.410]  So, now if they catch you as an unregistered caregiver, they're going to give you 10 days.
[01:07:38.410 --> 01:07:42.410]  And if you don't register in 10 days, you can't ever caregive again.
[01:07:42.410 --> 01:07:45.410]  Where do I do that? It doesn't even tell me how or where to do that.
[01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:47.410]  The bill, you have to require with the state health agency.
[01:07:47.410 --> 01:07:54.410]  If you go to the MED website, you can download the voluntary registry form that they've had up there for a while.
[01:07:54.410 --> 01:07:56.410]  I don't know that they've put a new form up.
[01:07:56.410 --> 01:07:58.410]  So, when this is signed into action, right?
[01:07:58.410 --> 01:08:00.410]  This got signed Monday.
[01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:05.410]  So, all caregivers, you guys have 10 days. By the time this episode comes out, we'll all be fucked.
[01:08:05.410 --> 01:08:10.410]  The 10 day time limit is like if a cop comes to your door and goes, are you a caregiver?
[01:08:10.410 --> 01:08:14.410]  And you go, yeah. And he goes, are you registered? And you go, no.
[01:08:14.410 --> 01:08:16.410]  Now you've got 10 days.
[01:08:16.410 --> 01:08:18.410]  All right.
[01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:26.410]  Or if the MED decides to mail all you guys letters saying, this is going to be received on the first or whatever,
[01:08:26.410 --> 01:08:30.410]  then you've got 10 days, they could fully pull that too and call that notice.
[01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:32.410]  Wow. All right.
[01:08:32.410 --> 01:08:45.410]  The bill requires the licensing authority and the state health agency to share a minimum amount of information necessary to ensure that a medical marijuana patient has only one caregiver and is not using a primary caregiver and a medical marijuana center.
[01:08:45.410 --> 01:08:47.410]  That makes sense.
[01:08:47.410 --> 01:08:53.410]  Yeah. Because if I'm a caregiver and I take good care of my patients, you guys get love.
[01:08:53.410 --> 01:08:59.410]  And any caregiver should be hooking up their patients a little bit, giving them some stuff, take care of them, make sure they're not hurting.
[01:08:59.410 --> 01:09:02.410]  If they come over and like my back hurts, you get out a fat dab of CBD and you fuck them up.
[01:09:02.410 --> 01:09:04.410]  Right.
[01:09:04.410 --> 01:09:11.410]  And also that caregiver or that patient should not be going to another caregiver and getting love from two people and spoiling the whole game.
[01:09:11.410 --> 01:09:14.410]  Right. Or signed up with multiple people.
[01:09:14.410 --> 01:09:19.410]  Yeah. I remember a lot of shop hoppers when shops were still able to do sign with us and get blah.
[01:09:19.410 --> 01:09:22.410]  People just go from shop to shop and sign up with aid in a day.
[01:09:22.410 --> 01:09:24.410]  Yep. And then get all kinds of free shit.
[01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:29.410]  And each shop would be under the assumption that they were growing your six. And so it led to some issues.
[01:09:29.410 --> 01:09:33.410]  So then here's another fun bill. Fun bill. It says this bill permits money.
[01:09:33.410 --> 01:09:42.410]  Monies in the marijuana tax fund to be used to fund the implementation of any bills approved by the marijuana revenues interim committee.
[01:09:42.410 --> 01:09:51.410]  So all of the marijuana tax money they want to now they will be able to use that to implement all of the bills approved by the committee.
[01:09:51.410 --> 01:09:53.410]  That's kind of some bullshit.
[01:09:53.410 --> 01:09:58.410]  Later in the bill, they dole out a couple of hundred grand random stuff that was never approved.
[01:09:58.410 --> 01:10:03.410]  It's just fugly from here on out, folks. Sorry for the downer.
[01:10:03.410 --> 01:10:09.410]  Yeah. Which what do we want to read? There were a couple of things in this. Which one do you want to hit on?
[01:10:10.410 --> 01:10:13.410]  Just a couple of bullet points on caregivers.
[01:10:13.410 --> 01:10:20.410]  You're limited to 36 plants. That's five plants or five patients, six plants per patient, plus your own six.
[01:10:20.410 --> 01:10:30.410]  Thirty six. Unless you special register all of your extended plant count cards, which in which case you can grow up to ninety nine.
[01:10:31.410 --> 01:10:39.410]  After ninety nine plants, you have to become a licensed marijuana business, which requires buying a building and business permits.
[01:10:39.410 --> 01:10:43.410]  So keep it under ninety nine people.
[01:10:43.410 --> 01:10:52.410]  If you're a Colorado medical marijuana patient, a Colorado recreational cannabis consumer, if you're listening to the show, this this bill applies to you.
[01:10:52.410 --> 01:10:57.410]  You need to check it out. You need to read it. If you've ever thought of growing plants, this is something you need to read right now.
[01:10:57.410 --> 01:11:03.410]  It's going to change everything. If you're far away and wondering what any of this has to do with you.
[01:11:03.410 --> 01:11:07.410]  This is what happens when the community doesn't stand up and speak for itself.
[01:11:07.410 --> 01:11:13.410]  Yeah. Is he gets railroaded and stuff like this? That's what I said at the beginning of the show. Right down.
[01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:18.410]  I slept on it. I didn't even know that this shit was coming up to vote on. I didn't know that I didn't know.
[01:11:18.410 --> 01:11:26.410]  No, I watched it come. I watched it work its way through the Colorado process and I watched people argue and fight.
[01:11:26.410 --> 01:11:32.410]  I read the articles and sent the emails and it just there was some progress.
[01:11:32.410 --> 01:11:36.410]  The original bill was a lot worse. Yeah. A lot worse.
[01:11:36.410 --> 01:11:40.410]  Did we go on like 42 minutes? You got anything you want to say? Let's start wrapping up the show.
[01:11:40.410 --> 01:11:49.410]  Register to vote and start paying attention to politics and hopefully we can stop getting just fucked as a community like this.
[01:11:49.410 --> 01:11:53.410]  And then go vote. You got to vote. There's a there's an election this year.
[01:11:53.410 --> 01:11:56.410]  Everybody's talking about 2016 and who's going to be the next president.
[01:11:56.410 --> 01:12:02.410]  There's an election between now and then that no one's really talking about here in Pueblo.
[01:12:02.410 --> 01:12:05.410]  It's real important. We're going to be voting on rec shops in the city.
[01:12:05.410 --> 01:12:09.410]  You told me that I kind of messed up the last report I said on that.
[01:12:09.410 --> 01:12:11.410]  Correct me because I don't want to be wrong on the show.
[01:12:11.410 --> 01:12:15.410]  It was episode 69 or 70. I don't remember which when you covered.
[01:12:15.410 --> 01:12:22.410]  Recently, the Pueblo City Council voted not to license rec shops in the city and they punted.
[01:12:22.410 --> 01:12:28.410]  So now the voters are going to decide on some marijuana question or another in November.
[01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:30.410]  The city council has no idea what they're going to ask the voters.
[01:12:30.410 --> 01:12:35.410]  It's not going to be the 11 page nonsense ordinance they didn't vote on last Monday.
[01:12:35.410 --> 01:12:40.410]  So hopefully it'll be a short and sweet. Do we want rec stores in the city? Yes or no.
[01:12:40.410 --> 01:12:48.410]  But who knows when I asked city council directly, I got a snarky response from one of them saying show up to those meetings and find out.
[01:12:49.410 --> 01:12:55.410]  Before I've said I'm impartial to rec stores in the city, but bring it on. We need a rec store in our city.
[01:12:55.410 --> 01:13:02.410]  We need those jobs and taxes. Pueblo is a poor city full of poor people who need jobs.
[01:13:02.410 --> 01:13:07.410]  Yeah. And if you can give us 12 jobs by opening a dispensary, that's 12 people.
[01:13:07.410 --> 01:13:13.410]  And that's something I've noticed that people our age, the 24 to 35 range that's been kind of fucked for the past 10 years.
[01:13:14.410 --> 01:13:19.410]  It finally got something to do. The people that got out of college and realized that there's nothing to fucking do with that college degree.
[01:13:19.410 --> 01:13:21.410]  Sorry to look you straight in the face when I say that. Right.
[01:13:21.410 --> 01:13:27.410]  But my sociology degree makes shit less confusing to me personally, but it doesn't do fuck off for my bills.
[01:13:27.410 --> 01:13:32.410]  Yeah. Yeah. You're going to work in a dispensary now. It's finally got something for you to do because of this industry.
[01:13:32.410 --> 01:13:36.410]  It's helping out. So I do support a dispensary in the city of Pueblo.
[01:13:36.410 --> 01:13:44.410]  If my opinion matters to you at all, vote yes. When it comes time to ask about opening dispensaries in the middle of town, because we need that.
[01:13:44.410 --> 01:13:47.410]  Make sure you're registered to vote. Make sure your friends are registered to vote.
[01:13:47.410 --> 01:13:50.410]  Make sure your lady or your man are registered to vote.
[01:13:50.410 --> 01:13:57.410]  If you're out here and you've got a crew and all you are in those nice ass hats with those pins, make sure you register to vote.
[01:13:57.410 --> 01:14:00.410]  Cannabis is a gateway drug. It's a gateway to politics.
[01:14:00.410 --> 01:14:02.410]  I wouldn't have cared about politics at all.
[01:14:03.410 --> 01:14:08.410]  I wouldn't have cared about politics and voting and gone to city council and shit at all had I not gotten involved in cannabis.
[01:14:08.410 --> 01:14:12.410]  The cannabis is the gateway drug, man, to politics.
[01:14:12.410 --> 01:14:15.410]  We've survived for so long by being invisible.
[01:14:15.410 --> 01:14:16.410]  We had to.
[01:14:16.410 --> 01:14:21.410]  We had to. That was how we thrived and survived. We were invisible. No one noticed us.
[01:14:21.410 --> 01:14:23.410]  And we stayed out of everybody's line of sight.
[01:14:23.410 --> 01:14:31.410]  And now if we don't all stand up real soon, we're not going to have legal marijuana in any state anymore.
[01:14:31.410 --> 01:14:36.410]  So if you guys that have cannabis legalized in your states, be careful. Pay attention to what they're doing.
[01:14:36.410 --> 01:14:39.410]  Washington just fucked up Royal. Did you read about that today?
[01:14:39.410 --> 01:14:42.410]  I've seen so much news that I don't know what happened in Washington.
[01:14:42.410 --> 01:14:44.410]  My brain is overwhelmed. I was focused on this show.
[01:14:44.410 --> 01:14:51.410]  So back maybe six, eight months ago, Colorado's, they did the first underage buy sting.
[01:14:51.410 --> 01:14:56.410]  And they hit 20 dispensaries in Colorado and up and tall and proud.
[01:14:56.410 --> 01:14:59.410]  Not one of them failed. Way to go boys.
[01:14:59.410 --> 01:15:00.410]  I congratulated them on the show.
[01:15:00.410 --> 01:15:05.410]  I'm a young Washington four of 22 failed. Oh, fuck you fuckers.
[01:15:05.410 --> 01:15:07.410]  I hope somebody firebombs your fucking store.
[01:15:07.410 --> 01:15:10.410]  I hope they take your license and shit in your weed.
[01:15:10.410 --> 01:15:15.410]  Yeah, that's Mike's opinion. I kind of agree, but not as fiercely.
[01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:18.410]  That does suck, dude. We give you the opportunity to make a lot of money.
[01:15:18.410 --> 01:15:22.410]  They sent them a letter a week in advance saying we're going to sting you.
[01:15:22.410 --> 01:15:26.410]  Don't fuck up. And four of them did.
[01:15:26.410 --> 01:15:30.410]  You know, part of where I'm going to give one of those credit to a stupid ass employee.
[01:15:30.410 --> 01:15:33.410]  These people should be crucified at HempFest next year.
[01:15:33.410 --> 01:15:39.410]  Yeah, let's get it right. You guys, we're going to fucking have this business that you're allowed to make a billion dollars with and sell cannabis.
[01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:42.410]  And they're letting us play. It's like, it's like mom's away.
[01:15:42.410 --> 01:15:46.410]  And your dad's like, sure, you could watch Playboy while she's gone and fucking now you're fucking it up.
[01:15:46.410 --> 01:15:50.410]  Now you're jerking off in front of the kids. Let's zip it up and do this right.
[01:15:50.410 --> 01:15:53.410]  You're right, dude. Firebomb. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just said that.
[01:15:53.410 --> 01:15:57.410]  It's just so ridiculous. I mean, don't really don't really firebomb them.
[01:15:57.410 --> 01:16:01.410]  But if you pull up there, the store names are in the news.
[01:16:01.410 --> 01:16:05.410]  If you if you live in Seattle and you used to shop there, don't anymore.
[01:16:05.410 --> 01:16:09.410]  If you have to pee when you're walking past, hit up their window. Fuck them.
[01:16:09.410 --> 01:16:16.410]  I don't know that we I can support that statement on the show because when their window gets pissed, this statement is brought to you by white Mike, not the podcast.
[01:16:16.410 --> 01:16:21.410]  Yeah. Yeah. All right. So now that Mike's got us pissing on windows, I think it's almost time to wrap up the damn show.
[01:16:22.410 --> 01:16:27.410]  Hey, wife. Yeah, I did shout out to the wife. I did not prompt him for that.
[01:16:27.410 --> 01:16:30.410]  She don't listen. I try to remind all my friends to say hi to their wives when they're on the show.
[01:16:30.410 --> 01:16:38.410]  Just get to a baby. Thanks for dinner, sweetie. I don't have one of those. So, hey, girl, my wife, my wife.
[01:16:38.410 --> 01:16:41.410]  I didn't my wife to show I made it the whole show.
[01:16:41.410 --> 01:16:48.410]  I saw Doug Benson and I was in the front row and he said my wife on stage or somebody else said my wife and he went my wife and I did it to my wife.
[01:16:49.410 --> 01:16:56.410]  And I think the people on stage heard me. It was kind of awkward for me. It was funny. Nice. All right. Yeah. Follow Mike on Twitter.
[01:16:56.410 --> 01:17:04.410]  Yeah. Hit me up. It's Nemo Punk 15. Any MOP you and K one five. Yeah. Follow him. He posts a lot of cool cannabis related shit.
[01:17:04.410 --> 01:17:09.410]  Lots of links. Lots of news. I appreciate the follows. Guys, guys, we're going to wrap this up.
[01:17:09.410 --> 01:17:13.410]  This will probably I'm not even sure what I'm going to put this out. It might be Monday. It might be Wednesday.
[01:17:13.410 --> 01:17:20.410]  Either way, I'll be back in a couple of days with another episode. I did not forget about that perpetual grow episode I told you about.
[01:17:20.410 --> 01:17:25.410]  Like I said, I've been writing that and more shit keeps popping up to do shows about. It was a big news week.
[01:17:25.410 --> 01:17:30.410]  Yes. And Mike was around and I was like, let's do this. It was time for you.
[01:17:30.410 --> 01:17:35.410]  Yeah. So I'll be back in a couple of days. I might have that perpetual episode ready by then.
[01:17:35.410 --> 01:17:38.410]  In the meantime, check out our sponsors, the Rocky Mountain Worm Company.

[01:19:53.410 --> 01:19:56.410]  That's the truth. A lot of the episodes come out of people's questions.
[01:19:56.410 --> 01:20:00.410]  So until next time, you guys, shout out to my ninja Spence. Thanks again for listening.
[01:20:00.410 --> 01:20:03.410]  Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:20:23.410 --> 01:21:20.820]  Yeah.
[01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:21.820]  Welcome back, cannabis community.
[01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:23.820]  It's time for episode number 73.
[01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:28.820]  The Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:32.820]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber,
[01:21:32.820 --> 01:21:36.820]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:39.820]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:41.820]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff. Thanks again for joining me.
[01:21:41.820 --> 01:21:46.820]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to the Mystic Roots band for letting me use their music on the show.
[01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:50.820]  Huge thanks to Kat, Coop, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:52.820]  What's up, guys? I'm going to turn that music down.
[01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:54.820]  Well, I'm going to turn it down a lot. It's kind of loud.
[01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:55.820]  There we go.
[01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:57.820]  Trying to get the party started.
[01:21:57.820 --> 01:22:01.820]  Speaking of getting the party started, big shout out to my friends, Deez, Roxy.
[01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:02.820]  Let's see who else is on there.
[01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:04.820]  I'm going to check on something real quick.
[01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:06.820]  I'll talk more about this later maybe.
[01:22:06.820 --> 01:22:08.820]  Shout out to Kenny. Shout out to Cody.
[01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:12.820]  And shout out to Cody, another Cody, two Codys, and Roxy also.
[01:22:12.820 --> 01:22:15.820]  I don't know if I said that.
[01:22:15.820 --> 01:22:20.820]  Those are some friends of mine that are watching me record this show live right now on Bong TV.
[01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:24.820]  They can't hear the show, but they are watching me record it on my webcam.
[01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:30.820]  I was in the chat room getting pumped up, just getting a little energy before the show, taking a couple dabs, and I thought, why turn off the cam?
[01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:32.820]  Why not just let those guys watch?
[01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:36.820]  So when you guys hear this, this is the episode that you're watching that you watched past tense.
[01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:39.820]  All right. Anyway, shout out to the Bong TV crew.
[01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:41.820]  There are no ads for this episode, you guys.
[01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:43.820]  We're not even going to do any commercials.
[01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:45.820]  We're going to get right down to business.
[01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:54.820]  I've been promising you guys a lesson on how to set up a perpetual grow, and I actually took a lot of time and figured out how to do that.
[01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:57.820]  I think I've got it figured out for you.
[01:22:57.820 --> 01:22:59.820]  Man, my arms are a little bit rubbery.
[01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:01.820]  I'm working through my paperwork here.
[01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:05.820]  I played my drums for about a good solid hour.
[01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:08.820]  I beat the shit out of those drums, and I needed that.
[01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:10.820]  That was kind of nice. I haven't played the drums in quite a while.
[01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:14.820]  I needed to make some space where the drums were for some grow things, of course.
[01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:16.820]  But then I had that space available.
[01:23:16.820 --> 01:23:20.820]  I set up a big... I'm just talking about the drum set on the podcast, you guys. I'm sorry.
[01:23:20.820 --> 01:23:22.820]  Anyway, I'm going to tell you more about it. I started.
[01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:29.820]  I've got an 8, a 10, a 12, a 14, 16-inch tom, a 22-inch kick drum, a 14-inch snare drum.
[01:23:29.820 --> 01:23:32.820]  I just tore the shit out of that kit all day today.
[01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:34.820]  It was like an hour. It felt like all day.
[01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:41.820]  I'm going to quit rambling. I'm going to find the notes here that are in my phone, and we will talk about this grow lesson that I wrote for you.
[01:23:41.820 --> 01:23:43.820]  Let's see. All right. I found it.
[01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:45.820]  I'm going to get to the point here, you guys. I'm super dabbed out.
[01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:50.820]  I'm just trying to talk through the dabness here for a minute and find my way through these clouds.
[01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:52.820]  Shout out to the Mystic Roots crew. Here we go.
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:55.820]  So, episode 73, scheduling a perpetual flow.
[01:23:55.820 --> 01:24:01.820]  When you're scheduling a perpetual grow, a few things you need to keep in mind are things like your plant count.
[01:24:01.820 --> 01:24:09.820]  If you're in a medical state like Colorado, where I am, you have a plant count, and you have to stay within that to be legal.
[01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:16.820]  This will be a good way to help you stay within your plant count and produce the amount of medicine or recreational cannabis you need to supply yourself.
[01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:19.820]  So, that's something you need to think about.
[01:24:19.820 --> 01:24:26.820]  How much herb do you require to keep yourself supplied without trying to be stingy, without trying to make a bunch of money?
[01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:30.820]  How much do you realistically want to grow, and how often do you need to grow it?
[01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:32.820]  That's going to be something we're going to talk about in a minute.
[01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:35.820]  Also, we will talk about how much space it's going to take.
[01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:38.820]  That's what will really dictate your grow.
[01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:42.820]  A lot of this stuff is covered in previous episodes, you guys, but we're going to go back over a lot of it.
[01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:51.820]  And we will, by the end, you will have a perpetual grow going if you follow this, I guess it's a recipe I wrote here.
[01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:55.820]  Anyway, holy shit, excuse my throat clearing there.
[01:24:55.820 --> 01:25:02.820]  This perpetual lesson is going to be based on one 1,000-watt flowering light.
[01:25:02.820 --> 01:25:06.820]  This covers about a 4x4 or a 5x5 square foot area.
[01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:09.820]  So, we're trying to create a perpetual grow that suits your needs.
[01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:16.820]  If you're using more lights, simply multiply this method by however many lights you're using or however you seem necessary.
[01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:22.820]  If you have questions, email me, growfromyourheart.hotmail.com, and we'll help adjust this recipe for your grow room.
[01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:24.820]  I'll tell you about my perpetual grow.
[01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:33.820]  I run a four-light setup, and I fill the whole light area with a set of plants and harvest one light every two weeks.
[01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:36.820]  So, here's where you need to make a decision on your perpetual setup.
[01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:45.820]  You need to decide if you want to start a crop under a light and finish the entire crop, and then have another set of plants ready as soon as that's done for you.
[01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:52.820]  So that as soon as you chop down that room, that light of plants, you have plants that were in veg in another room.
[01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:57.820]  As soon as they're done, do you want to refill the entire room, or do you want to kind of stagger it a little bit?
[01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:05.820]  I think it's a little, in my opinion, I like having a perpetual instead of having a whole bunch of herb to harvest all at one time.
[01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:12.820]  It can be a really daunting task, in my opinion, to try to harvest four lights worth of cannabis all at once.
[01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:18.820]  Gosh, guys, excuse my throat clearing. That'll go away here after a couple of minutes, I hope.
[01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:21.820]  All right, so if you're working with one strain, where was I? Let's see.
[01:26:21.820 --> 01:26:25.820]  Yeah, you need to decide if you want to start the whole crop and run the whole thing.
[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:29.820]  Where was I? You want to stagger your crops so you have a harvest every 30 days or two weeks.
[01:26:29.820 --> 01:26:32.820]  If you're working with one strain, that's a lot easier.
[01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:38.820]  If you've got multiple strains, try to get strains that you're going to have to time it.
[01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:41.820]  So try to get strains that are all about eight to nine weeks.
[01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:46.820]  That's your ideal setup for perpetual cycle under one light.
[01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:56.820]  So our main goal here is to have the rooms moving constantly with as little downtime as possible to keep your production at its maximum without any interruptions.
[01:26:56.820 --> 01:26:59.820]  That way you don't have any interruptions in your medicine.
[01:26:59.820 --> 01:27:02.820]  So I told you guys, let's see, I talked a little bit about my four light.
[01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:07.820]  My personal grow is a perpetual setup. I harvest one light every two weeks.
[01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:14.820]  Like I was saying, I'd rather trim one light worth of buds, which for me is a pound, than four lights, which would be four pounds easily.
[01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:18.820]  Sometimes it's a pound and a half. Sometimes it's more. It just depends on what strains I'm running.
[01:27:18.820 --> 01:27:22.820]  So I'm harvesting every two weeks. It means that every two weeks I'm cutting clones.
[01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:30.820]  I'm doing transplants. I'm taking clones out of the cloner, putting them into cups, and I'm harvesting every two weeks.
[01:27:30.820 --> 01:27:34.820]  So I have four flowering lights in my flowering area.
[01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:39.820]  I have two lights in my vegging area, and I have a separate light for my moms and clones.
[01:27:39.820 --> 01:27:48.820]  I have about every 14 days, I cut 12 clones. After 14 days, those clones go into cups and go under a light in my mom and clone area.
[01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:53.820]  This could be like a T5 or a metal halide light, or even an LED if you're into that.
[01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:59.820]  Those plants that I cut will stay in the cups for about two weeks before they're transplanted into seven gallon pots.
[01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:02.820]  And you guys, I'm going to give you a lot of detail about this. I know I'm going kind of fast right now.
[01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:05.820]  I'm giving you a setup on mine, and then I'll get into a lot of detail in a minute.
[01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:11.820]  So I can fit 12 seven gallon pots under my two veg lights comfortably. That gives them enough space.
[01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:16.820]  And keep in mind, some of these are... we got shit all the way from one week up to eight weeks old.
[01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:20.820]  So the ones on the far end there, they're real little, so we can squish those together.
[01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:25.820]  And the other ones over there on that end are a little larger, so they need more space. I can fit 12 of them.
[01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:32.820]  Once the plants are in the seven gallon pots, they'll hang out in the bedroom for like 30 to 45 days, depending on the strain.
[01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:38.820]  If you're going to set up this perpetual, it'll probably work out to exactly eight weeks if you do this right.
[01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:42.820]  I use large pots so I can keep big plants and keep my plant count down.
[01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:45.820]  Like I was talking about earlier, Colorado is limited by plant counts.
[01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:51.820]  So getting as much from each plant is important. As much as you can from each plant is important.
[01:28:51.820 --> 01:28:55.820]  So I have four sets of seven gallon pots under my veg lights.
[01:28:55.820 --> 01:28:58.820]  And I would have plants in veg for two, four, six, and eight weeks.
[01:28:58.820 --> 01:29:03.820]  And the plants that have been in veg for eight weeks will go into the flower room on week nine.
[01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:05.820]  And more plants will be dropped into seven gallon pots.
[01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:10.820]  Everything will be slid over four spaces. And the empty spaces I just made will be replaced.
[01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:15.820]  And it'll be Tetrised all right over the left so that it's right by the door of the next room.
[01:29:15.820 --> 01:29:18.820]  So like I said, every two weeks I'm harvesting a light. I'm cutting more clones.
[01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:27.820]  I'm putting clones into cups, putting cups into pots, and I'm keeping the cycle moving while maintaining a pest management regimen.
[01:29:27.820 --> 01:29:32.820]  I'm lollipopping these plants. I'm doing pruning. It's a lot of work to do in there, you guys.
[01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:36.820]  You can't just slack off, but it's a lot of work and it pays off every two weeks.
[01:29:36.820 --> 01:29:40.820]  I've got a pound of herb harvested for myself every two weeks if I do this properly.
[01:29:40.820 --> 01:29:44.820]  So that's basically my setup there. You guys might not have four lights.
[01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:49.820]  So let's talk about getting your perpetual plant. I got to reach over and plug this phone in.
[01:29:49.820 --> 01:29:56.820]  All right. So to have a perpetual grow, you'll need a solid mother plant or a source of reliable clones.
[01:29:56.820 --> 01:30:03.820]  I don't want to rely on somebody else for clones. I would definitely recommend keeping a mother plant if you have a mother plant.
[01:30:03.820 --> 01:30:09.820]  Maybe if I haven't talked thoroughly enough about mother plants, I'm going to write a note right now. I need a pen.
[01:30:09.820 --> 01:30:14.820]  I'll write a note to talk about mother plants in the future, and then we can kind of talk about keeping a mom.
[01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:19.820]  That'll be a whole other episode. Writing it down. Mother plant episode. Boom.
[01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:24.820]  I know it takes me a long time to write, but I'd rather be able to read it later. There we go. Mother plants. I wrote that.
[01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:31.820]  So have a good mother plant. I'll talk about selecting a mom. I'll go way into depth on that for you if I haven't.
[01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:37.820]  So for this mother plant, for the mother plant, you need a light cycle that stays on in a vegetative cycle.
[01:30:37.820 --> 01:30:43.820]  I recommend, of course, the 18 on and 6 off, or you can try 19-5 if that works for you.
[01:30:43.820 --> 01:30:48.820]  I do that because I see the plants growing and it keeps any sativas from auto flowering.
[01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:53.820]  I've had some sativas that like to auto flower if the light cycle changes just a little.
[01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:57.820]  And that 19-5, that extra hour, will keep them from doing that.
[01:30:57.820 --> 01:31:02.820]  So you can keep your mother plants and your clones and these cups on the same cycle.
[01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:12.820]  If you have one light, you can fit. If you have one good size fluorescent light, you can fit your cloner and a bunch of cups with clones in there underneath that T5.
[01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:17.820]  And you can probably fit a good size mother plant underneath there also if you do it right.
[01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:20.820]  I know two of those T5 fixtures would definitely do it.
[01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:30.820]  All right. So for this example, Mike and I were talking and of course I had to ask Mike for some help because I was getting stuck.
[01:31:30.820 --> 01:31:32.820]  So shout out to Mike for helping me.
[01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:39.820]  He came up with the idea to use two 5x5 grow tents because that's when he met me, I was growing in grow tents.
[01:31:39.820 --> 01:31:42.820]  He learned a lot from those grow tents.
[01:31:42.820 --> 01:31:44.820]  So we're using two of those 5x5 grow tents.
[01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:50.820]  If you don't have grow tents, you can use a bedroom or whatever and you can divide it into two spaces.
[01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:55.820]  As long as your flowering space is totally dark during the night cycle, you'll be okay.
[01:31:55.820 --> 01:32:02.820]  I can't stress enough how important it is to have a totally dark night cycle in your flowering room.
[01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:05.820]  Okay. So we're going to use two 5x5 tents, right?
[01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:08.820]  And you can use a bedroom. You can divide it out.
[01:32:08.820 --> 01:32:11.820]  So one is a flowering hut. I said that right.
[01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:13.820]  One's a veg space, one's a flowering hut.
[01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:15.820]  All right. So we've got the one flowering space.
[01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:17.820]  It's a 5x5 with a thousand watt light in there.
[01:32:17.820 --> 01:32:20.820]  Our other room is a 5x5 room or tent.
[01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:22.820]  That'll be our veg and mom space.
[01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:28.820]  All right. So it's actually going to take a couple of weeks to get your perpetual grow flowing and productive.
[01:32:28.820 --> 01:32:33.820]  But once it starts, the flow should run perfectly if you plan ahead and stay on top of your chores.
[01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:36.820]  Don't get lazy. Don't get complacent.
[01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:39.820]  You have to stay in there and be on top of things.
[01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:46.820]  So in my example, we're going to set up a perpetual grow to harvest one large plant every two weeks.
[01:32:46.820 --> 01:32:49.820]  And your goal is four ounces per plant with this method.
[01:32:49.820 --> 01:32:53.820]  So we're going to put one seven-gallon pot under the light every two weeks.
[01:32:53.820 --> 01:32:55.820]  We need to start with a mother plant or some clones.
[01:32:55.820 --> 01:32:57.820]  So in this case, we'll start with a healthy mom.
[01:32:57.820 --> 01:33:04.820]  You should have your mom's rooms or huts built and running before we even take the first clone for the perpetual grow.
[01:33:04.820 --> 01:33:07.820]  So you've got your rooms happy and your mother plant is nice and healthy.
[01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:09.820]  Now we cut clones to start our cycles.
[01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:14.820]  I don't know if you're using like rapid rooters or if you're using rock wool cubes or if you're using an easy cloner.
[01:33:14.820 --> 01:33:17.820]  But either way, two weeks is your due date for these clones.
[01:33:17.820 --> 01:33:20.820]  They've got to be rooted and ready to rock in two weeks.
[01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:27.820]  If you're not proficient in cloning, I would recommend cutting these clones early.
[01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:30.820]  So take some practice, get some practice and get some clones going.
[01:33:30.820 --> 01:33:32.820]  So we've got the five by five hut.
[01:33:32.820 --> 01:33:36.820]  That's one 1,000 watt flowering light and five by five area.
[01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:38.820]  So this is what would happen on week one.
[01:33:38.820 --> 01:33:41.820]  We would cut clones and let them root.
[01:33:41.820 --> 01:33:45.820]  And if for this one light situation, we only need one clone out of this whole setup.
[01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:51.820]  So cut some clones and hopefully in 14 days, one of those clones is rooted.
[01:33:51.820 --> 01:33:57.820]  So now week two, you don't have much to do except make sure the clones are rooted and happy.
[01:33:57.820 --> 01:34:02.820]  So week three of the perpetual cycle, you're going to take more clones.
[01:34:03.820 --> 01:34:07.820]  Okay, first you have to, I guess, take the clones out of the cloning area, put them into cups.
[01:34:07.820 --> 01:34:10.820]  And then you're also going to cut more clones for the next run.
[01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:12.820]  And you're only going to need one keeper again.
[01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:16.820]  So those clones that you just put into cups, you're going to let them go for 14 more days.
[01:34:16.820 --> 01:34:18.820]  And then you'll just pick the best one.
[01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:22.820]  And the clones that you just put in the cloner, in 14 days, you're going to pick the best one of those.
[01:34:22.820 --> 01:34:25.820]  All right, so we only need one at a time to survive.
[01:34:25.820 --> 01:34:29.820]  But cut extras, you guys, because it's always better to have some to choose from.
[01:34:30.820 --> 01:34:33.820]  So week four. Week four is another chill week.
[01:34:33.820 --> 01:34:37.820]  But make sure the cups and the clones are happy and as healthy as you can make them.
[01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:40.820]  And the mother plant, you need. So I didn't add that in here, you guys.
[01:34:40.820 --> 01:34:43.820]  We're going to need to make love to the mother plant every once in a while.
[01:34:43.820 --> 01:34:45.820]  You got to get in there and trim that sexy bitch up.
[01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:48.820]  So I guess taking clones every two weeks, you'll be able to do that.
[01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:50.820]  Something I should have made a note of.
[01:34:50.820 --> 01:34:54.820]  All right, week five. Week five is where we start to get busy, you guys.
[01:34:54.820 --> 01:34:56.820]  We need to put the clones into cups of dirt.
[01:34:56.820 --> 01:34:58.820]  We need to cut more clones.
[01:34:58.820 --> 01:35:02.820]  We only need one keeper, like I said, every two weeks.
[01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:04.820]  But I would take a few extras and choose from the best.
[01:35:04.820 --> 01:35:06.820]  I wrote that down a lot of times.
[01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:12.820]  The plants that we put into cups two weeks ago will now go into seven-gallon pots and go under the veg lights.
[01:35:12.820 --> 01:35:16.820]  If you're in that five-by-five hut, you should have plenty of room for your mother plant,
[01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:21.820]  a little bit of clones, a couple of cups, and four seven-gallon pots.
[01:35:21.820 --> 01:35:23.820]  It'll work. Trust me.
[01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:28.820]  In week five, we're going to put one seven-gallon pot under the veg lights.
[01:35:28.820 --> 01:35:30.820]  That's going to sit there for eight weeks, you guys.
[01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:33.820]  But now you have your first veg plant in veg.
[01:35:33.820 --> 01:35:34.820]  You're showing some progress.
[01:35:34.820 --> 01:35:39.820]  You got that one little itty-bitty plant in a seven-gallon pot, and it's only taken five weeks.
[01:35:39.820 --> 01:35:44.820]  Week six is kind of another chill week, but you have to make sure all your plants are looking good,
[01:35:44.820 --> 01:35:47.820]  because now you're really setting the pace for your productivity.
[01:35:47.820 --> 01:35:49.820]  Don't forget to watch for bugs.
[01:35:49.820 --> 01:35:52.820]  Start doing any pruning and training that you want to do.
[01:35:52.820 --> 01:35:54.820]  Make sure you're getting good on your cloning game.
[01:35:54.820 --> 01:35:56.820]  You've had a lot of practice by now.
[01:35:56.820 --> 01:35:59.820]  So just start perfecting shit. Start really paying attention to details.
[01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:02.820]  Now you have a rhythm going. Start paying attention to things.
[01:36:02.820 --> 01:36:04.820]  Let's move into week seven.
[01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:06.820]  I'm doing pretty good. I'm at about 16.
[01:36:06.820 --> 01:36:09.820]  Yeah, after a couple of edits here, we should be at about 15 minutes.
[01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:11.820]  So week seven.
[01:36:11.820 --> 01:36:16.820]  For week seven, we need to put the clones out of the cloning area into cups,
[01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:18.820]  and then we need to cut more clones.
[01:36:18.820 --> 01:36:21.820]  Remember, guys, we just need one, but cut several.
[01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:24.820]  Then we need to put another clone into a seven-gallon pot,
[01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:27.820]  and then that goes under that veg light.
[01:36:27.820 --> 01:36:31.820]  Now we have two of our first four plants under the veg light.
[01:36:31.820 --> 01:36:34.820]  The first one has seven more weeks.
[01:36:34.820 --> 01:36:37.820]  We're going on odd numbers, right?
[01:36:37.820 --> 01:36:41.820]  So it would have six more weeks to cook before it's going to go.
[01:36:41.820 --> 01:36:44.820]  The first one's got a few more weeks to cook before it's going to go into the veg room,
[01:36:44.820 --> 01:36:46.820]  and this one's now got eight.
[01:36:46.820 --> 01:36:49.820]  So the other one's got six, yeah, because we're going to be harvesting every two weeks.
[01:36:49.820 --> 01:36:54.820]  So week eight is another week to focus on training and pruning and plant health
[01:36:54.820 --> 01:36:57.820]  and keeping your mother plant happy, checking for bugs,
[01:36:57.820 --> 01:37:01.820]  going in there and cleaning up the bottoms of all the plants that are in the vegging area.
[01:37:01.820 --> 01:37:03.820]  There's stuff to do every week,
[01:37:03.820 --> 01:37:07.820]  even though we're not doing the big cycle on the even-numbered weeks.
[01:37:07.820 --> 01:37:10.820]  So week nine. I'm sure you're catching on by now.
[01:37:10.820 --> 01:37:14.820]  Take the clones out of the cloner, put them into cups, cut new clones,
[01:37:14.820 --> 01:37:18.820]  put a clone from a cup into a seven-gallon pot and into the veg area.
[01:37:18.820 --> 01:37:21.820]  So now you've got three seven-gallon pots under the veg light.
[01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:25.820]  One of them is getting big and bushy by now, and it's almost time to flower that bitch.
[01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:30.820]  If you want to do any topping or anything or any pruning to it, now is a good time.
[01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:35.820]  Week 10 is another off week, but it's a good time to check for bugs.
[01:37:35.820 --> 01:37:39.820]  We've been going at it for 10 weeks now, so check all of your equipment out.
[01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:43.820]  Clean up all your fans. Make sure the floor is clean.
[01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:45.820]  Just get in there and clean everything up on week 10.
[01:37:45.820 --> 01:37:50.820]  Week 11. Here we go again. We're going to put clones into cups.
[01:37:50.820 --> 01:37:56.820]  We're going to cut more clones. We're going to put our favorite clone into a seven-gallon pot
[01:37:56.820 --> 01:37:57.820]  and put that into the veg area.
[01:37:57.820 --> 01:38:01.820]  So now you have got four seven-gallon pots and your room is full,
[01:38:01.820 --> 01:38:05.820]  and we will flower out our first plant in two weeks.
[01:38:05.820 --> 01:38:06.820]  And I know that sounds like a long time.
[01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:11.820]  It's going to take us 13 weeks to flower our first plant before we even start flowering our first plant.
[01:38:11.820 --> 01:38:15.820]  But trust me, once you get this rhythm going, it's totally going to be worth it.
[01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:18.820]  So week 12. This is the last week before you start flowering plants.
[01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:21.820]  Make sure your bloom room is ready.
[01:38:21.820 --> 01:38:24.820]  Have that 5x5 flowering room cleaned up, sparkly.
[01:38:24.820 --> 01:38:28.820]  Make sure the floor is clean. Make sure the ceiling is clean.
[01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:30.820]  Clean it all. Clean it again.
[01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:32.820]  Even if you did, go in there and clean it again.
[01:38:32.820 --> 01:38:34.820]  And then after that, clean it one more time.
[01:38:34.820 --> 01:38:38.820]  And then inspect it one more time and find what you missed, because there is something that you missed.
[01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:40.820]  Do you have a fire extinguisher near your grow?
[01:38:40.820 --> 01:38:43.820]  Do you have a smoke detector near your grow?
[01:38:43.820 --> 01:38:45.820]  Those are probably two things you forgot about.
[01:38:45.820 --> 01:38:47.820]  I don't want to see your home.
[01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:49.820]  I don't even want to see what could happen.
[01:38:49.820 --> 01:38:50.820]  You know what I'm getting at, right?
[01:38:50.820 --> 01:38:54.820]  So get a smoke detector, put it near your grow, get a fire extinguisher, and put it outside of the room
[01:38:54.820 --> 01:39:00.820]  so that in the worst case scenario, you don't have to run in there to get the fire extinguisher to put the fucking fire out.
[01:39:00.820 --> 01:39:01.820]  Have it outside of the room.
[01:39:01.820 --> 01:39:03.820]  Yeah, just do that for me, please.
[01:39:03.820 --> 01:39:06.820]  So your room is ready. You're ready.
[01:39:06.820 --> 01:39:07.820]  The plants are ready.
[01:39:07.820 --> 01:39:09.820]  Week 13. Here we go, you guys.
[01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:11.820]  This is when it gets fun.
[01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:13.820]  This is the first day we start the flowering cycle.
[01:39:13.820 --> 01:39:19.820]  Today, you get to move that largest plant into the flowering room and begin the bloom phase.
[01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:24.820]  And now in eight to nine weeks, hopefully 60 days, we'll have buds to harvest.
[01:39:24.820 --> 01:39:31.820]  And then every two weeks after that, you can harvest if you keep this rhythm going properly.
[01:39:31.820 --> 01:39:34.820]  I'm serious about the scheduling of this.
[01:39:34.820 --> 01:39:42.820]  If you fuck this up, you will be way behind and everything will fall apart because you will miss a beat and you won't know where to jump back on.
[01:39:42.820 --> 01:39:44.820]  It's like playing a really fast song.
[01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:52.820]  And once you jumped off that beat, it's going to take a minute to recover, and your lungs and your smoking habits are definitely going to notice.
[01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:53.820]  So check it out.
[01:39:53.820 --> 01:39:58.820]  Week 13. Move that big plant that you've been working on that's been in veg for eight weeks now.
[01:39:58.820 --> 01:40:03.820]  That plant was in veg for eight weeks, in a cup for two weeks, and in a cloner for two other weeks.
[01:40:03.820 --> 01:40:05.820]  Twelve weeks of life.
[01:40:05.820 --> 01:40:08.820]  And now you're just now moving that sucker into the flowering room.
[01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:14.820]  So after you move that into the flowering room, feed it its flowering nutrients.
[01:40:14.820 --> 01:40:16.820]  You got to feed it flowering nutrients.
[01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:18.820]  We've talked about what to feed and stuff on week one.
[01:40:18.820 --> 01:40:22.820]  So feed that plant its flowering nutrients.
[01:40:22.820 --> 01:40:27.820]  Then you have to, you guessed it, take a clone out of the cloner, put it into a cup.
[01:40:27.820 --> 01:40:29.820]  Cut more clones.
[01:40:29.820 --> 01:40:37.820]  Put your favorite cup into a seven-gallon pot and replace that seven-gallon pot that you just moved into the flowering room with a fresh pot and a little baby plant in it.
[01:40:37.820 --> 01:40:42.820]  So now you've got one plant in flower, and you should have four plants in veg.
[01:40:42.820 --> 01:40:46.820]  Now our goal is to keep this moving and add a plant into the room every two weeks.
[01:40:46.820 --> 01:40:55.820]  You'll need to cut clones, put clones into cups, put a cup into a seven-gallon pot, drag a fresh plant into the flowering room every two weeks.
[01:40:55.820 --> 01:41:03.820]  And eventually, you will also be harvesting a plant every two weeks if you're running a 56 to 60-day strain.
[01:41:03.820 --> 01:41:12.820]  Yes, if that went right, that means that every two weeks you'll be pulling off about a quarter pound of herb for yourself if you do this properly.
[01:41:12.820 --> 01:41:22.820]  It will become a small part-time job for yourself to maintain this, but the more work and love you put into it, the better your product will be, I promise you.
[01:41:22.820 --> 01:41:24.820]  Some people are like, how is your herb so good?
[01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:26.820]  And I'm like, I go in the grow room for hours every day.
[01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:29.820]  I touch every single plant with my hands.
[01:41:29.820 --> 01:41:30.820]  I look on the bottoms of the leaves.
[01:41:30.820 --> 01:41:34.820]  I walk in there in the morning, and I'm like, which plant haven't I spent enough time with?
[01:41:34.820 --> 01:41:39.820]  And I pick one, and I turn the leaves upside down, and I look at the bottoms of the leaves and make sure there are no bugs.
[01:41:39.820 --> 01:41:44.820]  And I look around the room, and I just stare into the room like an old guy staring off the porch into nothing.
[01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:56.820]  But I'm looking around the room to see if there's a problem that maybe I didn't miss, or maybe if there's something I could tweak to make the air flow a little bit better to control the temperature and the humidity just a little bit better when I'm away.
[01:41:56.820 --> 01:41:57.820]  I don't know.
[01:41:57.820 --> 01:41:58.820]  So be in there.
[01:41:58.820 --> 01:41:59.820]  Do some work.
[01:41:59.820 --> 01:42:00.820]  Keep on top of it.
[01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:02.820]  I don't even know what the fuck started that rant.
[01:42:02.820 --> 01:42:03.820]  I'm sorry.
[01:42:03.820 --> 01:42:07.820]  So after eight weeks, it'll be time to harvest that first plant that you put into your flowering room.
[01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:10.820]  It may need a few extra days for the plant to finish.
[01:42:10.820 --> 01:42:24.820]  Just squeeze that plant in there for the last few days, or if you have this available, put that plant in its own dark room for two days before you harvest it, and it will kind of dense up the buds, and I think it'll kind of make it a little more resinous.
[01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:28.820]  I think it does make it kind of more dense is the word for it.
[01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:29.820]  It tightens up a little bit.
[01:42:29.820 --> 01:42:34.820]  That 48 hours of dark kind of shocks the plant and makes it kick out the last bit of resin that it can put out.
[01:42:34.820 --> 01:42:35.820]  It's getting freaked out.
[01:42:35.820 --> 01:42:37.820]  It knows it's going to die.
[01:42:37.820 --> 01:42:56.820]  So now you should have a full perpetual setup that should yield three to five ounces of herb every two weeks, and if you do this right, you can keep your plant count down to like 10 or 15 if you only have one mother plant and you get good at cloning because you're going to have four in flower, and then you're going to have four in your veg area.
[01:42:56.820 --> 01:42:57.820]  That's eight plants.
[01:42:57.820 --> 01:43:01.820]  Then you've got your mother plant, and then you've got that one that's in a cup.
[01:43:01.820 --> 01:43:03.820]  That's 10 plants right there.
[01:43:04.820 --> 01:43:17.820]  If you take a couple of extra clones and have a couple of extra mother plants or whatever, that's going to put you up near 15 or 20, but, dude, you're pulling a quarter pound of herb with 10 plants in your house, and you're using two, maybe three lights doing this.
[01:43:17.820 --> 01:43:19.820]  See, that's going to work.
[01:43:19.820 --> 01:43:20.820]  It's going to work for you guys.
[01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:22.820]  If you have any questions, let me know.
[01:43:23.820 --> 01:43:36.820]  Another option here would be to veg all four of your plants for 30 to 45 days and throw them all into the flowering room, and it's a good idea, but like I was saying, when it comes to harvesting all that pot, you're hopefully going to pull off a pound of weed here, you guys, maybe a pound and a quarter.
[01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:39.820]  Oh, my God, I just burped that root beer right into the mic.
[01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:40.820]  I'm sorry.
[01:43:40.820 --> 01:43:42.820]  Rude, rude, rude, rock star.
[01:43:42.820 --> 01:43:45.820]  You're hoping to pull a pound and a quarter, pound and a half of herb off that.
[01:43:46.820 --> 01:43:54.820]  I would rather trim three to five ounces every two weeks and give my wrist a break than be at it trimming for two weeks straight because it gets crazy.
[01:43:54.820 --> 01:43:59.820]  You start cutting down plants, and they're all ripe at the same time, and so you got shit drying all at the same time.
[01:43:59.820 --> 01:44:00.820]  You go into panic mode.
[01:44:00.820 --> 01:44:03.820]  You got to trim this whole pound of herb.
[01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:12.820]  I trim, usually myself and one, maybe two other people at the table because it just gets crowded, and it gets loud, and I'd rather keep it peaceful and have less people here.
[01:44:12.820 --> 01:44:14.820]  Just kind of quiet for my head.
[01:44:14.820 --> 01:44:16.820]  So that's why I do the perpetual grow.
[01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:20.820]  It's a little bit better, and then it also makes you feel like something's happening.
[01:44:20.820 --> 01:44:25.820]  Instead of waiting 60 days for that damn crop to finish, you can, oh, it's cool.
[01:44:25.820 --> 01:44:28.820]  I've got one in two weeks, so it doesn't feel like it's so long.
[01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:34.820]  Of course, the next crop is 60 days, but since I started one 40 days ago, and then what's 40 minus 14?
[01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:41.820]  I fucked myself picking a weird number like that, but since I picked one seven weeks ago and started it, then I'm going to have one in two weeks.
[01:44:41.820 --> 01:44:44.820]  And then I'm going to have one in two weeks after that.
[01:44:44.820 --> 01:44:45.820]  I thought ahead.
[01:44:45.820 --> 01:44:48.820]  I'm rambling because I took a lot of fat dabs in this.
[01:44:48.820 --> 01:44:50.820]  Yeah, anyway.
[01:44:50.820 --> 01:44:57.820]  So if you choose to run them all at one time, you should have plants in that bedroom ready to flower as soon as that room is empty.
[01:44:57.820 --> 01:45:06.820]  So you're going to have to keep a mother plant and then four pots, four seven-gallon pots for about eight weeks.
[01:45:06.820 --> 01:45:09.820]  So you'll need clones for two weeks, cups for two weeks.
[01:45:09.820 --> 01:45:13.820]  You'll need four of them, four clones, four cups, two weeks each.
[01:45:13.820 --> 01:45:17.820]  And then you throw those into the seven-gallon pots and let those go for eight weeks.
[01:45:17.820 --> 01:45:25.820]  And then when you chop that other room, you throw those plants in there that same day.
[01:45:25.820 --> 01:45:28.820]  That's the only way to keep it going if you want to do it all at once.
[01:45:28.820 --> 01:45:32.820]  Or you can do two plants every 30 days if that's easier for you.
[01:45:32.820 --> 01:45:35.820]  If you'd rather have a half a pound of herb every 30 days, you could do that.
[01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:36.820]  As this is completely adjustable.
[01:45:36.820 --> 01:45:40.820]  This was just the best I could come up with since I don't know your garden.
[01:45:40.820 --> 01:45:41.820]  I hope you find it useful.
[01:45:41.820 --> 01:45:43.820]  I hope you put it to use.
[01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:50.820]  I hope you start pulling off somewhere between three and five ounces for yourself or your patients every two weeks.
[01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:52.820]  That's a good supply of medicine for you.
[01:45:52.820 --> 01:45:56.820]  If you're smoking more than that, well, I can't judge.
[01:45:56.820 --> 01:45:58.820]  Smoke more than that, fuck it.
[01:45:58.820 --> 01:45:59.820]  I'm not even going to try to judge you for it.
[01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:01.820]  You might have some reason.
[01:46:01.820 --> 01:46:04.820]  You might have hardcore dab syndrome like I do.
[01:46:04.820 --> 01:46:06.820]  All right, you guys, I've been going for close to 30 minutes.
[01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:09.820]  I really appreciate you guys listening to the show.
[01:46:09.820 --> 01:46:12.820]  I've been taunting you and teasing you about this perpetual grow episode.
[01:46:12.820 --> 01:46:14.820]  You can see why it took me a minute.
[01:46:14.820 --> 01:46:16.820]  It took me 13 weeks to get to the flowering cycle.
[01:46:16.820 --> 01:46:19.820]  I feel like I went really quickly with all of the stuff that I wrote.
[01:46:19.820 --> 01:46:21.820]  If I skipped anything, please correct me.
[01:46:21.820 --> 01:46:23.820]  Let me know.
[01:46:23.820 --> 01:46:26.820]  You pay so much more attention when I do like a 30-minute episode.
[01:46:26.820 --> 01:46:30.820]  I'm going to start wrapping up the show like a fat joint.
[01:46:30.820 --> 01:46:32.820]  You guys, thanks a lot for listening.
[01:46:32.820 --> 01:46:36.820]  I will be back next Monday with a fresh episode for you.
[01:46:36.820 --> 01:46:38.820]  We're getting close to 100, and I'm getting excited.
[01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:40.820]  Thanks for all your support.

[01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:17.820]  and I will read your comments on a future episode.
[01:47:17.820 --> 01:47:19.820]  Stitcher sucks for comments right now.
[01:47:19.820 --> 01:47:21.820]  They keep changing the platform.
[01:47:21.820 --> 01:47:25.820]  Just leave a comment somewhere on there, and I will find it hopefully.
[01:47:25.820 --> 01:47:27.820]  Yeah, the reason you want to leave a comment on iTunes
[01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:30.820]  and give me a five-star rating is because that moves me up in the ranks
[01:47:30.820 --> 01:47:31.820]  and people see the show.
[01:47:31.820 --> 01:47:34.820]  If we are noticed, then it puts us in the view of more folks,
[01:47:34.820 --> 01:47:36.820]  which will make more people grow better cannabis,
[01:47:36.820 --> 01:47:39.820]  which means you'll be able to smoke more better cannabis.
[01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:41.820]  I just said smoke more better cannabis.
[01:47:41.820 --> 01:47:43.820]  My grammar is getting awesome.
[01:47:43.820 --> 01:47:46.820]  Oh, we better just get to the end of this before my brain explodes.
[01:47:46.820 --> 01:47:49.820]  If you guys have something to say, find me on all the social media.
[01:47:49.820 --> 01:47:50.820]  I would appreciate it.

[01:48:41.820 --> 01:48:44.820]  I'm going to go over here and make sure I'm telling you I'm in the right chat room.
[01:48:44.820 --> 01:48:48.820]  This was recorded on Tripp's Pot Party.
[01:48:48.820 --> 01:48:51.820]  If you go to TinyChat, it's tinychat.com slash Tripp's Pot Party.
[01:48:51.820 --> 01:48:53.820]  Sometimes I'm on there.
[01:48:53.820 --> 01:48:56.820]  Sometimes I am on tinychat.com slash.
[01:48:56.820 --> 01:49:00.820]  I'm looking at it right now so that I can not tell you the wrong one.
[01:49:00.820 --> 01:49:01.820]  Come on, browser.
[01:49:01.820 --> 01:49:03.820]  I have so much shit going on on the computer right now
[01:49:03.820 --> 01:49:06.820]  that I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't want to do this.
[01:49:06.820 --> 01:49:08.820]  It's lagging a little, but we'll get there, y'all.
[01:49:08.820 --> 01:49:09.820]  We'll get there together.
[01:49:09.820 --> 01:49:10.820]  Here we go.
[01:49:10.820 --> 01:49:15.820]  The appropriate web address will be.
[01:49:15.820 --> 01:49:16.820]  It will be.
[01:49:16.820 --> 01:49:17.820]  There we go.
[01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:20.820]  TinyChat.com slash BTVLiveMaine.
[01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:22.820]  Sometimes I'm in that chat room.
[01:49:22.820 --> 01:49:25.820]  Sometimes I am in the other chat room.
[01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:28.820]  It's usually late at night when I am bored and can't sleep,
[01:49:28.820 --> 01:49:30.820]  and I've got a lot on my mind, and I'm trying to write a podcast,
[01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:31.820]  and I need a dab break.
[01:49:31.820 --> 01:49:33.820]  I jump in here and chat with these folks.
[01:49:33.820 --> 01:49:35.820]  Deez is shaking his head right now.
[01:49:35.820 --> 01:49:37.820]  He doesn't know I'm still watching him.
[01:49:37.820 --> 01:49:38.820]  But big shout-out to Deez.
[01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:39.820]  Big shout-out to all my friends in the chat room.
[01:49:39.820 --> 01:49:41.820]  You guys keep me sane late at night.
[01:49:41.820 --> 01:49:42.820]  Us growers have weird hours.
[01:49:42.820 --> 01:49:44.820]  We need friends online like you.
[01:49:44.820 --> 01:49:46.820]  Thanks to all you guys for listening to the show.
[01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:48.820]  I've been rambling on for a long time today.
[01:49:48.820 --> 01:49:50.820]  I'm going to put better shows together.
[01:49:50.820 --> 01:49:53.820]  You guys can tell that my head wound is definitely clearing up,
[01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:56.820]  and I also want to give a big shout-out to Alpha Brain.
[01:49:56.820 --> 01:50:01.820]  If you need a boost in your brain and you don't want to do, like,
[01:50:01.820 --> 01:50:05.820]  caffeine or yerba mate because it makes you too jittery or something,
[01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:09.820]  I definitely recommend Alpha Brain from Onnit.com.
[01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:11.820]  O-N-N-I-T.com.
[01:50:11.820 --> 01:50:12.820]  They don't pay me to say that shit, dude.
[01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:14.820]  I just sounded like I was doing a paid ad,
[01:50:14.820 --> 01:50:15.820]  and they did not pay me to say that.
[01:50:15.820 --> 01:50:17.820]  It's shit that I use.
[01:50:17.820 --> 01:50:19.820]  It made my head feel a lot better after my head injury.
[01:50:19.820 --> 01:50:23.820]  It made the clouds go away, and it obviously made me a little rambly,
[01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:24.820]  but that's confidence.
[01:50:24.820 --> 01:50:26.820]  So, yeah, I'm going to wrap up the show.
[01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:28.820]  You guys, thanks for listening.
[01:50:28.820 --> 01:50:29.820]  I hope I did you a lot of good.
[01:50:29.820 --> 01:50:32.820]  I hope you're setting up a perpetual grow right now as we speak.
[01:50:32.820 --> 01:50:34.820]  Shout-out to my ninja Spence.
[01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:39.820]  Until next time, you guys, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:41.820]  Feeling the vibes, I'm alive.
[01:50:41.820 --> 01:50:42.820]  Let's get it.
[01:50:42.820 --> 01:50:44.820]  Party tonight, all night, you said it.
[01:50:44.820 --> 01:50:46.820]  Yeah, I'm all right, ice tight.
[01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:47.820]  I'm just feeling it.
[01:50:47.820 --> 01:50:48.820]  You know when it's right.
[01:50:48.820 --> 01:51:20.000]  I'll ignite that feeling.
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.000]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:25.000]  It's time for episode number 73, 73, 74.
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:26.000]  I don't know.
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000]  It might be 74 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:31.000]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000]  if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber,
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:38.000]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:42.000]  about the current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:43.000]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:44.000]  Thanks again for joining me.
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000]  Sitting across the table from me is my good buddy, White Mike.
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:47.000]  How you doing, bro?
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.000]  I'm doing good.
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:49.000]  How you doing, buddy?
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:50.000]  I'm doing great, dude.
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000]  I want to give you a big personal thank you before we start the show.
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000]  My car has been broke down like you guys all know,
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:57.000]  and Mike was kind enough to run my errands for me today,
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:01.000]  and he actually stopped at the donut shop on the way home.
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000]  So we're all hopped up on donuts and caffeine right now.
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:04.000]  It's going to be a great show.
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000]  Thanks, dude, for hooking me up with a ride lately.
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:07.000]  Happy to, man.
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:11.000]  Also, while we're giving thanks, I've got to give a thanks to the Mystic Roots band.
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:15.000]  That song that I cut off abruptly there was the doggy dub from the Mystic Roots off their album,
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.000]  The Constant Struggle.
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:19.000]  Shout out to Cat Coot and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000]  I like that they let me play their music on the show.
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000]  That is really super kind of them.
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:26.000]  I also show a shout out to my buddy, Deez.
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:29.000]  He's working on a new intro song for me, so big thanks to Deez.
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000]  Mike and I were talking.
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:32.000]  We were kind of hanging out.
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:35.000]  We didn't have anything to do on a Saturday night because we're a couple of bums,
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:38.000]  and we're like, why don't we do something productive and record a podcast?
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000]  Put some time to good use.
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000]  Yeah, you know, put our time to use.
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000]  Put our sugar to good use.
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000]  I'm going to be bouncing off the walls here.
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.000]  Thank you, Amy.
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.000]  Yeah, thanks, Amy's Donuts.
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000]  Shout out to Amy's Donuts in Pueblo.
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:54.000]  And whoever was the one sad, lonely guy working the night.
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.000]  Glad to make you laugh, bro.
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:57.000]  Thanks for the sugar.
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:01.000]  We weren't going to stop and get donuts, but as we drove by, we could see into the building
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:05.000]  that there was just one dude standing there staring out the window watching traffic.
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:10.000]  And I predicted that if we waited four hours without going, he may kill himself standing there staring out the window.
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:13.000]  He looked so sad and lonely.
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000]  We just had to go cheer him up.
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000]  I bought some donuts and Mike gave the dude a fat tip.
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000]  That was nice of you.
[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:20.000]  Well, fat for Pueblo.
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000]  Yeah, it was a donut tip.
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.000]  When I handed it to him, it was kind of clear that he did not expect to get tipped on this shift.
[01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:29.000]  Well, then now he's got money for whatever he does after work.
[01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000]  He's at least got a story to tell at the end of the day.
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:34.000]  So these two super high guys came through and bought a lot of donuts.
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:38.000]  Part of the directions were to fill the box with something, quote, colorful.
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:39.000]  That's what I said.
[01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:42.000]  I was like, I want one of these specific donuts because they're tasty as fuck.
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:45.000]  And then after that, just put colorful shit in the box.
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000]  And he met that goal.
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:51.000]  We're looking forward to eating the lime green and possibly apple flavored one later.
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:52.000]  I don't know what that is.
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000]  A couple of them got marshmallow on there.
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:58.000]  I really try to stay away from the marshmallow products, but, you know, he didn't know that.
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000]  Like I said, I've had a lot of sugar.
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:04.000]  Yeah, we've been talking about donuts for almost three minutes now.
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000]  So there are no ads on this show.
[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:07.000]  We're going to read some news.
[01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000]  The other day I told Mike, he was talking about news.
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000]  He's like, I tweeted you some good news.
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:15.000]  And no, not necessarily good news, good news articles.
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:18.000]  That's not all good news, but he tweeted that shit to me.
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:21.000]  And he's like, you can go ahead and use that on the show.
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:24.000]  And I was like, dude, why don't you go ahead and be like my news guy?
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:27.000]  Why don't you send me all the news about cannabis that you can find?
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:32.000]  And that way I can work on the grow lessons and we can get Mike doing a lot of news for us.
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:36.000]  I still have to read all the news and review it, but Mike's searching out the news a little more for me.
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:37.000]  So shout out to Mike.
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000]  He's going to keep doing that for us.
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:40.000]  Happy to, man.
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:41.000]  I hope.
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:42.000]  Got to keep the people informed.
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:43.000]  Yeah, that's what we're here for.
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:50.000]  I don't have time to do this show's news, the grow, the spot, my grow.
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:51.000]  Focus on what you do best, buddy.
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:52.000]  Everybody's got their wheelhouse.
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:56.000]  So having you do some news is definitely going to make it a little bit of an improvement.
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:03.000]  Guys, if you get bored of the news shows, I apologize, but I think it's just as important as the lessons and things.
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:04.000]  And tweet at both of us.
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:05.000]  Tell us you want more or less.
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:08.000]  And if you find a news article you want me to read, you can tweet it to me.
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000]  It's at GFYH podcast on Twitter.
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:13.000]  Anyway, let's find one of these news articles we're talking about.
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:14.000]  You ready for this, dude?
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:15.000]  Yep.
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:18.000]  Let's start with, let's start with Florida.
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:19.000]  Oh, Florida.
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.000]  What have you done now?
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  Well, it's usually some fucked up shit we hear about from Florida, but this one doesn't involve a goat.
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000]  It does not involve a chainsaw.
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:28.000]  No face eating.
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:29.000]  No bath salts.
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:30.000]  That's where I was headed.
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:31.000]  So this is actually...
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000]  This is a step in the right direction for Florida.
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000]  Yes, Florida's going the right way.
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:38.000]  Of course, I've got a giant slide on my screen right in the way here.
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:39.000]  Where did that article go?
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:46.000]  I'm going to have to refresh because this website I'm using is filled with ads that I cannot find the article under.
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:47.000]  All right.
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000]  There's actually some good news coming out of Florida this time.
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.000]  I'm scrolling to the article right now.
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:57.000]  And the headline is, Florida low THC medical marijuana law passes major hurdle.
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  I'm sure you guys kind of know where this is headed.
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  And it says, this is actually from the firstcoastnews.com.
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.000]  I got to give them credit.
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000]  And it says, we've shared their emotional stories.
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:10.000]  Parents from all over the state have been waiting, waiting to get their hands on Charlotte's Web,
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:17.000]  a low THC form of medical marijuana to treat illnesses their children have, such as epilepsy, seizures, and cancer.
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000]  And it says, from Tallahassee, Florida, we've shared their emotional stories.
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:24.000]  Parents from all over the state have been waiting, waiting to get their hands on Charlotte's Web,
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:31.000]  a low THC form of medical marijuana to treat illnesses their children have, such as epilepsy, seizures, and cancer.
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:38.000]  And now finally, on Wednesday, they got an answer when a judge threw out a lawsuit holding up the implementation of the drug.
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:42.000]  Jeff Sharkey started the Medical Marijuana Business Association.
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:46.000]  He's followed the entire process of Charlotte's Web, from lawmakers legalizing it last year,
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:53.000]  to several lawsuits from potential growers halting the sale of the drug, to today, with a sale date in sight.
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:57.000]  The rule that was finally approved was fair and balanced, Sharkey said.
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000]  It's been a long discussion and dialogue.
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000]  It's been a long discussion and dialogue.
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000]  And I know there's been some frustration with it.
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  But here we are with a rule that's going into effect.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  Sorry, guys, I'm trying to cough and read at the same time.
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:16.000]  We'll have people submitting applications to become dispensaries, and I think Florida is ready for this.
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:20.000]  Florida's Department of Health has been the agency in charge of implementing Charlotte's Web.
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:26.000]  They're expecting, or they're expected to take applications from eligible growers within three weeks.
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:30.000]  Under the law, only five will be chosen to sell it.
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:36.000]  So pretty soon in Florida, there will be five dispensaries selling Charlotte's Web medicine.
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000]  I have mixed emotions about this.
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:39.000]  How about you, Mike?
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  You look like you got shit to say already.
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:49.000]  It's, I mean, I feel a little bad because I didn't follow this story as closely as I follow most cannabis news, because it's another Charlotte's Web state law.
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:58:06.000]  And while any progress towards medical marijuana access is huge and awesome, and it's another big win for reality and science, CBD only is silly and just a, it's a half step that no one needs to take at this point.
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:09.000]  California has been medical since 1996.
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:15.000]  All of this CBD stuff in Charlotte's Web came out of our medical marijuana system here.
[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:24.000]  THC is fantastic medicine, and thanks to the vote last year in Florida, they've got CBD only now thanks to this law, but it's only Charlotte's Web specific.
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:27.000]  It's the only strain they can sell and grow.
[01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:36.000]  Realm of Caring did an amazing job trademarking and getting their name out and pitching it as safe and not intoxicating.
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:41.000]  Add that and Sanjay Gupta together and we've got 13 CBD only states.
[01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:44.000]  I know I said I had mixed emotions.
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:56.000]  One of my opinions is like you said, it's great that we have medical marijuana in Florida now so that these kids can get their medicine and the parents don't have to watch their children suffer and the kids can live a happy, normal life.
[01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:00.000]  I don't think that CBD only medicine is the way to go.
[01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:09.000]  Also, like you're saying, this one company that owns the Charlotte's Web is going to make money off of this like crazy, and that's not a cool way to go about medical cannabis.
[01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:20.000]  If you really think about it, the article talks about the kids, but it's not just children in Florida that would be accessing Charlotte's Web medications through these five dispensaries.
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:25.000]  There's all the adult patients with all of those conditions as well.
[01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:32.000]  You're talking about a huge number of people, five store locations, one product brand.
[01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:35.000]  Are we going to run out?
[01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:36.000]  Oh, for sure.
[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:43.000]  There's going to be huge product limitations and it's going to be like two ridiculous costs per gram like it is out here.
[01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000]  I don't know the price off the top of my head.
[01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:53.000]  I almost threw out a random number, but I don't want to do that because it's ridiculously high, but I don't want to be wrong about how ridiculously high.
[01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:54.000]  Okay.
[01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:55.000]  I'll let you live with that answer.
[01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:56.000]  Yeah.
[01:59:56.000 --> 02:00:01.000]  So there's something that Mike said that the THC is good medicine.
[02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:02.000]  There's something I feel about.
[02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:05.000]  We used to call it the entourage effect in Colorado.
[02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:19.000]  Now the industry term has moved to the synergistic effect, and that's the effect of the cannabinoids, the paleates, the terpenoids, the flavonoids, and the esters all working together to provide you a medicinal benefit.
[02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:26.000]  Just by isolating the CBD, I don't think you're getting the full benefit of the medicinal cannabis.
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:29.000]  You're going to say it works with the kids and the kids don't have seizures.
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:30.000]  Yeah.
[02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:36.000]  For me, CBD medicine doesn't do anything for my medical condition that I smoke for.
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:40.000]  It works great for me, but it doesn't do everything I need it to.
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000]  I need the THC half of that puzzle as well.
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:43.000]  Yeah.
[02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:44.000]  Yeah.
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:45.000]  Mike-
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:50.000]  We see this with the ... There's been a 100% THC pill called Maranol on the market for decades.
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:51.000]  No one likes it because-
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:52.000]  Nobody likes it.
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:55.000]  It doesn't have the rest of the cannabinoids in it.
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:56.000]  You need that balance.
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:57.000]  They tried Sativa-
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:58.000]  Sativax.
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:59.000]  Sativax.
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:00.000]  I think they just called it Sativa X.
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:01.000]  Sativa X.
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:07.280]  There's one company in Europe that's doing a whole plant extract where they're taking
[02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:13.000]  the whole raw marijuana plant and making some sort of, I think it's a sublingual spray,
[02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000]  you spray it under your tongue like Banaca.
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:16.000]  Nice.
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:19.000]  And they were testing it for MS the last I read.
[02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:24.000]  So there are companies looking at whole marijuana plant extract rather than isolating one or
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:25.000]  two components.
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000]  Does your friend Dave listen to the podcast?
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:28.000]  I have no idea he should.
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:29.000]  All right.
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:30.000]  Well, if you do, bro, shout out.
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:31.000]  I thought of you when he said that.
[02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000]  We've got a friend that could benefit from this sublingual spray.
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:34.000]  For sure.
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:35.000]  Did I say that right?
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:36.000]  Sublingual?
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:37.000]  Sub-
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:38.000]  Yep.
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:39.000]  Nice.
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:40.000]  I just spat that one out.
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:44.000]  Yeah, so this is going to work for a lot of people, but I'm a medical smoker and I definitely
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:47.000]  need my THC heavy Sativas.
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:52.000]  So shout out for going the right direction, Florida, for trying to do the medical thing.
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:53.000]  Maybe this will open the door.
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:56.000]  How long do they have to just go with CBD medicine?
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:00.000]  This is the end of what they have going for now.
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:06.000]  I'm sure there's another group working towards getting legalization on the ballot in Florida,
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:09.000]  either medical or rec again in the next presidential, but-
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:10.000]  I guess we can look at it this way.
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:11.000]  So far it's this.
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:12.000]  Gosh, excuse me, guys.
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:17.000]  I had sugary Dr. Pepper and donuts and my voice is already all fucked up from the show.
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000]  But we can look at it this way.
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:25.000]  The sick kids who have seizures and epilepsy and cancer and things like that that need
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000]  help can now get the CBD medicine.
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:31.000]  And the people like you and I that are in our 30s that know some people that know some
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:34.000]  people that aren't, we're able-bodied.
[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000]  We can go out and get some herb.
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:37.000]  You know what I mean?
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:38.000]  So that's cool.
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:41.000]  Those kids needed it way more than the folks that want the Sativas.
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000]  So I guess it does, it helps a lot still.
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:49.000]  I'm a big fan, but at the same time, I remember how many epilepsy patients used to come into
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:50.000]  the shop.
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:58.000]  I remember them enough to have researched some of this stuff after we left and THC is
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000]  fairly effective on treating seizures.
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:08.000]  And so having some THC in an anti-seizure medication that's made from cannabis makes
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000]  a whole lot of sense.
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:15.000]  In Charlotte's Web specific laws, we didn't end up with Charlotte's Web because we saw
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:19.000]  it working great for seizures and dove into that.
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:26.000]  They found it had no THC and that certain medical patients were looking for a non-intoxicating
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:27.000]  medication.
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:28.000]  And it worked for that.
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:29.000]  And they're afraid to give the THC to the kids.
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:30.000]  That's the big scary part here.
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:34.000]  It makes a much better pitch when there's absolutely no THC in there.
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:38.000]  When you can just say straight up, there's no high to it.
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000]  You can take as much as you want.
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:46.000]  There's no intoxicating effect, but an intoxicating effect doesn't mean non-medical effect.
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000]  It just means also intoxicating.
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000]  All right, let's get out of Florida.
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:51.000]  Thanks, Florida.
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:54.000]  We've done a couple minutes on that news topic.
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:55.000]  I don't want to bore the folks.
[02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000]  CBD was big in the news this week.
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:58.000]  Yes.
[02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:02.000]  CBD is going to remain big in the news, I think, for the next little while.
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:03.000]  What's the next, this is a random question.
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:06.000]  What's the next cannabinoid to pop up that's going to be popular?
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:07.000]  I'm hoping it's CBG.
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:10.000]  That's what I was going to say, just from what I've seen.
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:17.000]  I had the good fortune to get a small sample of CBG capsules.
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:18.000]  Very neat.
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:21.000]  It was during a period of time where I had some bad back pain.
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:24.000]  Oh, Lordy, they helped me get through some long shifts.
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:25.000]  Did those come from within our circle?
[02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:26.000]  They did.
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:27.000]  I had some of those.
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000]  They made me sleep like a baby.
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:30.000]  Yes, that was awesome.
[02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:31.000]  Maybe I need some of those.
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:32.000]  I've been having some sleep issues lately.
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:35.000]  I've been smoking too much Sativa and taking the Alpha Brain.
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:38.000]  One more reason to get caregivers back into the testing labs.
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:41.000]  I've been talking about this Alpha Brain, and when I take it too late in the day,
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:44.000]  it gives me the most craziest dreams.
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:47.000]  We just did an article from Florida.
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:52.000]  Let's jump to our hometown here in the lovely Steel City, Pueblo, Colorado.
[02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000]  What's up, Pueblo?
[02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000]  719.
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:01.000]  The headline here is, Pueblo County Wants to Keep Excess Weed Money.
[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:04.000]  This article is by Jeff Tucker from the Pueblo Chieftain.
[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:12.000]  And it says, Pueblo County will be asking voters whether they want the equivalent of about three spins of the City Park Kitties ride,
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:20.000]  or if they would rather let the government use a little less than $150,000 in excess marijuana revenues for something else.
[02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:23.000]  Guys that aren't from Pueblo, that's a local joke.
[02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:24.000]  We've got a park here with some kitty rides.
[02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:30.000]  It costs like 50 cents, and they're saying that they're going to write a check for about three spins on those shitty rides,
[02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:37.000]  or if they'd rather let the city just keep the money in the excess marijuana revenues and use it for something else.
[02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:43.000]  So it says, the Pueblo Board of County Commissioners instructed County Attorney Greg Steidar on Wednesday
[02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:52.000]  to start work on a ballot language that will give voters an option on what to do with the marijuana sales tax money they collected in 2014.
[02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:58.000]  As part of the exemption, the 3.5% sales tax from the state taxpayers' bill of rights.
[02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:03.000]  Let's make sure I read that right. 3.5% sales tax from the state taxpayers' bill of rights.
[02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:10.000]  The county made an estimated income of $400,000 from the marijuana sales tax collection.
[02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:19.000]  In the first year of legal recreational sales in Pueblo County, $548,479 was collected from sales tax,
[02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:29.000]  meaning that $148,479 is due back to the public unless voters give the county approval to keep it.
[02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000]  Do you have an opinion on that?
[02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:32.000]  Let them keep it.
[02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:37.000]  Yeah, let them keep it. Maybe they can fill some of the damn potholes that are all over this city, everywhere.
[02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:41.000]  It's funny you say that. The county raked in a huge amount of money.
[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:46.000]  It was like $1.7 million just in Pueblo County last year from the marijuana industry.
[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:50.000]  Half of that was taxes, half of that was fees and application fees and things like that.
[02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:58.000]  But Pueblo West Metropolitan District whined that all the shops were there, but they weren't getting a special cut.
[02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:03.000]  So the county commissioners broke them off like $200,000 or $300,000, and they're throwing it all into their streets.
[02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000]  It's a great plan.
[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000]  And they need their streets repaired as badly as we do.
[02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:10.000]  They made a good argument. The shops are all here. We want a cut.
[02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:13.000]  And so the county said, here's your cut, and they said, thanks for the road money.
[02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:17.000]  Was it an extra shitty winter, or are the roads just not getting paid attention to?
[02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000]  Because they've been terrible here lately.
[02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:20.000]  Yes.
[02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:21.000]  Okay. I thought it was a little bit of both.
[02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:29.000]  One of the side issues I caught down at city council is our roads right now, to get them up to speed at the pace we're doing,
[02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:33.000]  just to get the Pueblo stuff in order is going to take 50 years.
[02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:36.000]  That's how bad our infrastructure stuff is right now.
[02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000]  And that's not just Pueblo. That's all over the nation.
[02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:41.000]  That's why bridges are collapsing and trains are crashing.
[02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000]  Wow. Holy crap.
[02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000]  Time to invest in infrastructure.
[02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000]  I would rather have not heard that.
[02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:52.000]  So one of the big reasons to vote this year, make sure you're registered to vote for this November election,
[02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:56.000]  is if you're in Colorado, you're going to have half a dozen marijuana questions,
[02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:03.000]  almost all of which are your state asking if they can keep the extra tax revenue they collected last year,
[02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:07.000]  your county asking the same question, your city asking the same question.
[02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:10.000]  So get registered to vote, people.
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:16.000]  Register to vote. And guys, in the future, Mike is going to come do an episode for us all about how to get yourself into politics.
[02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:21.000]  If you're ready to lobby for cannabis or anything else, Mike is going to come kind of teach us a little bit.
[02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:25.000]  I put him on the spot now. He just looked at me like, shit, now I really have to do that.
[02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000]  It'll just be a quickie, bro.
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:32.000]  Just teach my friends that are listening how to get into politics, how to get themselves started,
[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:35.000]  get them going to council meetings and shaking hands.
[02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000]  Mike will get you on the right track.
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000]  All right. So that was our article from Pueblo.
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:42.000]  Let's see how long we've been recording before we jump in anything else.
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:46.000]  All right. We got some time left. We're doing good. We're doing very well.
[02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000]  You need a dab? I could definitely go for a dab.
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:52.000]  I'll get you a dab. You want CBD or THC?
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:58.000]  I've got, well, your options are here, this tora bora that was grown by myself and extracted by our good friends at the Garden of Wheaton.
[02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000]  Shout out, family. Much love.
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:04.000]  And then from our good friends over at Terpex, Terpy boys.
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:05.000]  What's up, fellas?
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:10.000]  And I picked this up over at the Green and Healthy Wellness in lovely Colorado Springs.
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000]  I really like that place. I was in a week or two ago.
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000]  Very nice guys, right? Shout out to John John.
[02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:15.000]  Great fellas.
[02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:18.000]  John Randall's Jr. What's up, buddy?
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:22.000]  We got some Durban poison on the sativa end of things.
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:26.000]  And we've got some 818 headband, which in my opinion is more on the indica side of things.
[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000]  I feel like I'm on Getting Doug with High right now.
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:29.000]  I think it's poison time.
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000]  Go for the poison.
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000]  Poison.
[02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:37.000]  I think I'm going to get sued if I do that too much longer.
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000]  You get what, 15 seconds?
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:42.000]  There are rules around that and I read them.
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:47.000]  And as long as I'm not making money, it's cool if nobody gets mad.
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000]  If they get offended, they can make me take it down.
[02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:52.000]  But really, it's like a Fair Use Act law.
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:53.000]  Right.
[02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:56.000]  And I'm just talking out of my ass kind of right now.
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:59.000]  I don't remember exactly what I read, but you can and can't at the same time.
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:00.000]  And it's up to whoever.
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000]  If I get permission, then I can use whatever I want.
[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:07.000]  Like the songs I use in the intros and outros, Mystic Roots Band has given me full permission.
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000]  DJ Nickity has given me permission.
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:13.000]  I totally just tried to stab the microphone.
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000]  So Mike held up the rig.
[02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:18.000]  I don't know if that was your second time doing it or if you're the second person,
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:24.000]  but he put his mouth full on to the microphone and tried to dab through the microphone.
[02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:28.000]  I went to put the dab on the nail and for some reason put my face on the microphone.
[02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000]  I didn't know that was going to do anything for me.
[02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:33.000]  I saw the process happen in your brain, and it was fucking funny.
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:34.000]  All right.
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:35.000]  I'm going to start reading this article.
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000]  I don't even remember what the hell I was saying anymore.
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:42.000]  Feds tell their employees to stay away from marijuana, even in states that have legalized.
[02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:45.000]  So if you're a federal agent—
[02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000]  Shout out to Terpy Boys.
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:48.000]  That was delicious.
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:49.000]  Oh, yeah.
[02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:50.000]  Big shout out to the Terpy Crew.
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000]  We're going to get them back on the podcast again.
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:55.000]  I'll have my car back here within the next few days,
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:58.000]  so I'll be able to go do a podcast with the Terpy Boy Crew.
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000]  Shout out to the Cannabis Grand Crew.
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:03.000]  That's happening as we record right now.
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000]  I wish we were there, but I was not prepared.
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:08.000]  So this article, if you're a mailman—
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000]  What a mail person.
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000]  We shouldn't say mailman because they're a female mail carrier.
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:13.000]  Mail carrier.
[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:17.000]  If you're a mail carrier, is this a state park people?
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:18.000]  If you work for the Department of Wildlife?
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:19.000]  Everywhere.
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:20.000]  Park rangers.
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000]  Anybody that works for the federal government.
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:23.000]  It's a huge number of people.
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000]  IRS, FBI.
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000]  IRS can't smoke weed no more?
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:28.000]  No.
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:29.000]  Oh, man.
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000]  If I had to crunch numbers like that all day, I couldn't take a dad.
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:32.000]  Post office going up.
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:33.000]  Yeah.
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:34.000]  Yep.
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000]  So let's read the article.
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:40.000]  The federal government wants to clear with its federal employees
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:44.000]  that might live in states that have reformed their marijuana laws.
[02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:47.000]  Marijuana remains illegal, so don't use it.
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000]  In guidance issued this week from Catherine Archuleta,
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:52.000]  Director of the U.S. Office of Personal Management—
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000]  that's personnel management—
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000]  to the heads of all federal departments and agencies,
[02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:00.000]  Archuleta says in no uncertain terms that marijuana use
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:07.000]  for the more than 4.1 million federal employees across the nation is banned.
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:08.000]  Not a shocker.
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:09.000]  No, not at all.
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:10.000]  But what about—
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000]  Man, people need to smoke their medical cannabis.
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:16.000]  If that's what makes you feel better, you need to be able to do that.
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:17.000]  Feds don't care.
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:18.000]  Schedule one.
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:19.000]  Yeah, the feds have no heart.
[02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000]  High level of abuse, no medical use.
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000]  The feds have no heart.
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:27.000]  Federal law on marijuana remains unchanged, she writes in a letter,
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:28.000]  announcing the guidance.
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:33.000]  We've got four legal states, 30-some medical states,
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:36.000]  and 23 medical states and 13 CBD only,
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:40.000]  and not one of them came with worker protection.
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:44.000]  So you can take any other intoxicating medication you feel like
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:48.000]  or are prescribed or your doctor recommends, but not cannabis.
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:49.000]  Not cannabis.
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000]  It might be intoxicating.
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:55.000]  So who's—how do we go about writing the worker protection rules?
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:56.000]  Who does that?
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:59.000]  That's probably not going to happen in our lifetime.
[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000]  Start it.
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:02.000]  That's your new job, Mike.
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:03.000]  There you go.
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:04.000]  Your new calling in line.
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:08.000]  Okay, someone's got to pay me for that amount of lobbying.
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:09.000]  All right, guys.
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:10.000]  Click the donate button.
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:11.000]  You know where I'm headed with this.
[02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:14.000]  There is a donate button, and you write Mike on there,
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000]  and then Mike will use that.
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000]  When that transmission's done getting paid.
[02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:19.000]  Oh, God, don't remind me.
[02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000]  We'll transfer that over to me.
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:22.000]  Don't remind me.
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:25.000]  So Mike just—he's not even reading the article,
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:28.000]  and he just said, while four states have legal—
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000]  you just read part of the article out of your brain.
[02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:34.000]  So federal employees are also part of the Drug-Free Workplace Act guidelines,
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:37.000]  which ban any use of illegal drugs on and off duty.
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:40.000]  In general, most of the routine drug testing of federal employees primarily occurs,
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:44.000]  but then federal agencies that have personnel with safety-sensitive jobs,
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:49.000]  like those working in law enforcement or national security.
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:53.000]  This would be a good time to mention to those of you living in not Colorado,
[02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:56.000]  thinking about moving to heaven,
[02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:01.000]  and for our wonderful wheelaws that have a job when you get here,
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:04.000]  because they're going to drug test just like the one in Minneapolis,
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:07.000]  wherever you're flying from, Texas.
[02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:10.000]  Yep. I had a friend that had to pass a drug test yesterday, in fact.
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000]  She's like, how do I do it?
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000]  I was like, I don't know.
[02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:18.000]  If I have to take a pee test, I don't even want to work there.
[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:21.000]  I had to do that back before dabs were a thing,
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000]  and dabs have been a thing for a while,
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:27.000]  so I've probably forgotten exactly how to do that now.
[02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:30.000]  My way of doing it is—the only way I can do it is use fake piss.
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000]  It's the only way I've ever been able to pass a pee test.
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:35.000]  You go buy that fake pee and keep it warm.
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:38.000]  I just took breaks and I was just bee sober.
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000]  It was never that painful.
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:43.000]  One time, dude, I went 63 days without smoking.
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000]  I don't want to try it out. It would take me a year.
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000]  I still failed the drug test, and I really didn't smoke.
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000]  Everyone was like, you had to have smoked.
[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000]  I was like, no, I went to Reggae on the Rocks with my brother Bradley
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:54.000]  and rolled down the windows when he puffed, and I did not puff at all.
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:57.000]  He was laughing at me, and I still failed the pee test.
[02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:00.000]  If you're a fed in any way—who else is a fed?
[02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000]  We always said mailman, park rangers.
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:05.000]  Well, it applies to all sorts of stuff, C-DOT.
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:11.000]  There's a number of different professions, I suppose is the easiest way to say it,
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:16.000]  that have rules that the feds get to lay out, regulations that the feds get to lay out.
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:21.000]  A lot of it comes with tax breaks, if, and one of those ifs is almost always,
[02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:26.000]  Drug Free Workplace Act, which is why shit like McDonald's drug tests, like mad.
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:29.000]  They're not going to have to. They're all going to be kiosks pretty soon.
[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:30.000]  Yep.
[02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:33.000]  All right, that article actually came from the Huffington Post by a dude named Matt Ferner.
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:36.000]  Thanks for letting me read your article there, Matt Ferner.
[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:40.000]  Let's see. I'll probably get in one more article here.
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:41.000]  Do you want to make it a good one?
[02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:44.000]  Yeah, we got about five minutes before I want to start wrapping it up.
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000]  Let's see. That one's going to be long. That one's kind of cool.
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000]  Let's wrap this up with a funny one.
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000]  You guys, we talked a whole bunch of stuff.
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:53.000]  If you made it to the 30-minute mark on this show, here is something great for you.
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:54.000]  Thanks for hanging in.
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000]  Yeah. This one is good, you guys.
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:59.000]  It says—and where is this from?
[02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000]  Okay, this is from Pendleton, Oregon.
[02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:07.000]  And it says, man asks city to ban fart smells for a good reason.
[02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:10.000]  And this came from the Huffington Post. It's written by Hillary Henson.
[02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000]  I really liked this story.
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000]  The article goes like this. You guys are going to like this also.
[02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:21.000]  It says, a resident of Pendleton, Oregon has written a letter requesting the city council ban the smell of farts in the community.
[02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:24.000]  But he has good reason to be raising a stink.
[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:31.000]  Last week, the city of Pendleton uploaded its nuisance ordinance to cover the smell of marijuana, NBC reported at the time.
[02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:36.000]  That means that even though recreational marijuana will be legal in Oregon starting in July,
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:43.000]  a person can be fined up to $500 if someone complains they smell marijuana coming from that person's property.
[02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:46.000]  In a letter published in the East Oregonian on Thursday,
[02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:52.000]  someone who signed his name as Peter Walters merely asked that council members take the next logical step
[02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:55.000]  and start regulating a far more noxious scent.
[02:16:55.000 --> 02:17:01.000]  It was with great relief Thursday when I read the East Oregonian that Pendleton City Council
[02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:05.000]  took the time to pass an amendment to the city's nuisance order banning marijuana order.
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:09.000]  Clearly, there has been no issue of greater importance facing the city.
[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000]  Now that this important work has been completed,
[02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:18.000]  I hope the council will move on to restricting the other offensive smell that plagues our community, farts.
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:23.000]  Walters, who is pretty clearly mocking the marijuana ordinances, notes,
[02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:27.000]  some habitual farters argue that they need to fart for medical reasons,
[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:31.000]  but that doesn't mean my kids should have to smell their farts.
[02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:32.000]  It's just beautiful.
[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:33.000]  That's great.
[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:37.000]  If you're an elected official and you behave absurdly,
[02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:44.000]  people have the right to mock the living shit out of you by sending you public letters asking you to ban the smell of farts.
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:49.000]  Pueblo, last summer, we passed a smell ordinance down here.
[02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:54.000]  It's considered automatically a yes, that's definitely offensive thing
[02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:57.000]  if your neighbor whines about the smell of your pot garden.
[02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:03.000]  You can be smoking marijuana on your porch and that smell cannot be considered automatically offensive.
[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:08.000]  But growing marijuana is automatically offensive by city ordinance.
[02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:11.000]  It's the only odor that you can get in trouble for in Pueblo.
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:14.000]  Well, if this passes, I pretty much can't go to Pendleton, Oregon.
[02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:17.000]  Banned.
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:18.000]  I will be fined.
[02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:21.000]  I mean, oops, 500 bucks every couple of minutes out of me.
[02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000]  I'm a farting fool on some days.
[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:24.000]  I think it's this vegetarian diet.
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000]  That's what knew it to me.
[02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:27.000]  All right.
[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:30.000]  So pretty soon, you guys in Pendleton, Oregon, they're going to ban farts.
[02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:36.000]  Not really, but I think that's a great way to respond to some dipshit ordinances made by some dipshit people.
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:40.000]  Big shout out to the guy who signed his name as Peter Walters.
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:41.000]  I don't know who you are.
[02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:42.000]  Way to go, Peter.
[02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:43.000]  But you're one of my heroes today.
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:44.000]  Shout out, bro.
[02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000]  So we've gone 30 minutes.
[02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:52.000]  We've got some more news, but we're going to save that for another episode because you guys really like these 30-minute episodes.
[02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000]  Dude, Mike, thanks for hanging out with me today.
[02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:55.000]  Thanks for recording the podcast.
[02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000]  Thanks for kind of being my chauffeur.
[02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:58.000]  That little Ford Focus is killer.
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000]  We just need to get you a better stereo in there, bro.
[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:01.000]  Oh, yeah.
[02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000]  That whole car is from 2001.
[02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:04.000]  Well, it's not the car.
[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:09.000]  It's what the radio plays around here makes me want to stab my ears with fucking butter knives.
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:10.000]  It's terrible.
[02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:17.000]  Clear Channel's taken over the world, and I've been back or pushed back to FM recently, and it's been a tough transition.
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:25.000]  I'm pretty sure I heard Taylor Swift, Poison, Metallica, and I think it was some Bon Jovi on the way over here just as you channel surfed.
[02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000]  Yeah, we were in the car for a while.
[02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:28.000]  It got fucking bad, people.
[02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:29.000]  Yeah.
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000]  Thank God the digital age came along when it did.
[02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:35.000]  I'll be so glad to get my car back, and then we'll get everything back together.
[02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000]  Shout out to all the people that have helped me out.
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:41.000]  There are a couple people that have really given me some rides and shit for the past few days, done me some favors.
[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:46.000]  Shout out to the people that have showed up at my house with food because I hate eating food that I have at home.
[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000]  I cook the same shit all the time.
[02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000]  There are a couple of people that have showed up with some fatty meals.
[02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000]  It's hard to be a homebound vegetarian.
[02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:53.000]  Yeah, right, because all my shit's fresh.
[02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:56.000]  You can't stock the fridge for more than three days.
[02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:57.000]  Yep.
[02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:58.000]  Well, I can get a few.
[02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000]  You know, more than a few days.
[02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:03.000]  I bought a shit ton of bananas and apples, and I've been eating all kinds of goodies.
[02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000]  But, yeah, so thanks to the people that have helped me out.
[02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:06.000]  We're going to wrap up the show.
[02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:09.000]  Mike, remind these people how they can follow you on Twitter one more time.
[02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000]  At Nemopunk15.
[02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:12.000]  Right on there.
[02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000]  Follow me, guys, because he does do a lot of cannabis posting.
[02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:15.000]  He's one of my homies.
[02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:16.000]  He's part of the team.
[02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:20.000]  If you follow me from the podcast, just shoot me a tweet saying that's why you're following me,
[02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:24.000]  because every time I do a show, I get random followers all week long.
[02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:25.000]  Nice.
[02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:31.000]  And I have to wonder if it's me taunting Kevin Sebette that day or the podcast, and I just, I'll never know.
[02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:34.000]  Oh, now all these people are going to go troll Kevin Sebette for you.
[02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:39.000]  If they're following me on Twitter, it's something they're going to get to enjoy anyway.
[02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:40.000]  Nice.
[02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:41.000]  Man, it was a pleasure recording with you.
[02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:42.000]  I'm going to wrap up the show.
[02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:43.000]  So it goes like this, you guys.
[02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000]  Thanks for listening to another episode.

[02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:31.000]  I'll have a couple of homies come over.
[02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:32.000]  I'll keep them honest.
[02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:33.000]  Yeah.
[02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:36.000]  So now that the show's over, you guys, please go to iTunes.
[02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:37.000]  Go to the iTunes store.
[02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:38.000]  Search for Grow From Your Heart.
[02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000]  Find the review section.
[02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:41.000]  Give me a five-star rating.
[02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:42.000]  And after that, type in a little comment.
[02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:43.000]  Let me know what you think of the show.
[02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:46.000]  And I will read your comments on a future episode.
[02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:47.000]  I really appreciate the comments.
[02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000]  That keeps the show moving up in the ranks.
[02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000]  It keeps more people aware of the show.
[02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:54.000]  The more people that know about the show, the more people will listen to the show.
[02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:55.000]  They'll grow better cannabis.
[02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000]  Tell your dealer about the show, yo.
[02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:58.000]  Your dealer.
[02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000]  Tell your caregiver about the show.
[02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:01.000]  Tell your grower about the show.
[02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:02.000]  Yeah.
[02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:03.000]  Tell everybody about it.
[02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:04.000]  Tell your grandma about it, too.
[02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:05.000]  Tell like five people.
[02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:08.000]  Because if you tell five people, then two people will probably listen.
[02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000]  So more people learn about the show.
[02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:11.000]  They'll get to watch it.
[02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:12.000]  Yeah.
[02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:13.000]  I read that.

[02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000]  go ahead and send him, what do you need, a couple million?
[02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:04.000]  Yeah.
[02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:05.000]  Yeah, a couple mil should do it.
[02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:06.000]  Like eight to ten.
[02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:09.000]  Don't drop that in my PayPal account because I don't want to pay taxes on that.
[02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000]  Eight to ten million, just send me an email.
[02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:15.000]  Yeah, shoot us an email and I'll set up my own PayPal account if you want to fund that particular effort.
[02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:16.000]  There you go.
[02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:20.000]  If you want to throw a few thousand, or you know what, if you got a bunch of pennies you want to throw at the podcast,
[02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:21.000]  we would appreciate it.
[02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000]  We could use a couple new Mike covers.
[02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:24.000]  I've been spitting into this one for a minute.
[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000]  I just tried to dab this one.
[02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:27.000]  It's a little snug, you know.
[02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000]  Oh, yummy.
[02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:30.000]  All right, you guys.
[02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000]  Please follow us on the social media sites.
[02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:33.000]  I love the interaction.
[02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:36.000]  Yeah, once again, big shout out to my ninja spints.
[02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:39.000]  Until next time, you guys, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[02:25:52.590 --> 02:26:20.590]  Thank you.
[02:26:21.590 --> 02:26:26.590]  Have you guys ever noticed that you can take a dab, or even flowers do it, but dabs have definitely made it happen more?
[02:26:26.590 --> 02:26:30.590]  Have you ever smoked a certain strain and it made you have to poop right away?
[02:26:32.590 --> 02:26:33.590]  You went silent on me.
[02:26:33.590 --> 02:26:39.590]  No, I'm just going to give the question the thought that I would a rational question.
[02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:40.590]  All right.
[02:26:40.590 --> 02:26:45.590]  I have noticed that occasionally there will be a certain strain that will come around and I'll take a dab,
[02:26:45.590 --> 02:26:49.590]  and almost every time I dab it, I will get the urge to poop right away.
[02:26:49.590 --> 02:26:53.590]  I had a phenotype of deadhead OG.
[02:26:53.590 --> 02:26:56.590]  It was deadhead OG number two was the phenotype.
[02:26:56.590 --> 02:27:00.590]  Every time I smoked it, bro, I would get like, oh, I'm needing to fart right now.
[02:27:00.590 --> 02:27:01.590]  I got to go poop.
[02:27:01.590 --> 02:27:08.590]  I know those specific cannabinoids that have been found to really help with digestive issues.
[02:27:08.590 --> 02:27:09.590]  Well, then it's probably got that.
[02:27:09.590 --> 02:27:10.590]  It could fully be a part of that.
[02:27:10.590 --> 02:27:12.590]  I don't know which one it is.
[02:27:12.590 --> 02:27:13.590]  Yeah.
[02:27:13.590 --> 02:27:16.590]  But you may have stumbled into a strain that's high in it.
[02:27:16.590 --> 02:27:17.590]  Okay.
[02:27:17.590 --> 02:27:19.590]  Well, something we dab tonight.
[02:27:23.590 --> 02:27:26.590]  That's what I'm going to blame it on because I was cool and then we took a dab.
[02:27:26.590 --> 02:27:28.590]  Which dabs are you blaming this on?
[02:27:28.590 --> 02:27:33.590]  Well, the change in the menu, the new addition that we've been trying a lot tonight is this headband.
[02:27:33.590 --> 02:27:34.590]  And I just.
[02:27:34.590 --> 02:27:36.590]  Have I been dabbing the headband as well?
[02:27:36.590 --> 02:27:38.590]  You've been dabbing the headband as well.
[02:27:38.590 --> 02:27:39.590]  Okay.
[02:27:39.590 --> 02:27:40.590]  It's not the weed then.
[02:27:40.590 --> 02:27:41.590]  Okay.
[02:27:41.590 --> 02:27:42.590]  It's the black bean burgers.
[02:27:42.590 --> 02:27:43.590]  You dirty hippie.
[02:27:43.590 --> 02:27:44.590]  Oh, man.
[02:27:44.590 --> 02:27:45.590]  Trying to blame.
[02:27:45.590 --> 02:27:46.590]  So listeners, I'm curious.
[02:27:46.590 --> 02:27:47.590]  Tweet me.
[02:27:47.590 --> 02:27:48.590]  Find me on Facebook.
[02:27:48.590 --> 02:27:49.590]  Do something.
[02:27:49.590 --> 02:27:50.590]  Interact with me.
[02:27:50.590 --> 02:27:51.590]  Let me know.
[02:27:51.590 --> 02:27:53.590]  Is there a certain strain that when you smoke, it makes you have to poop?
[02:27:53.590 --> 02:27:54.590]  I'm just curious.
[02:27:54.590 --> 02:27:55.590]  I want to know if this is just me.
[02:27:55.590 --> 02:27:57.590]  Tweet that at Russ Jeff.
[02:27:57.590 --> 02:27:58.590]  Yeah.

[02:28:04.590 --> 02:28:05.590]  All right.
[02:28:05.590 --> 02:28:07.590]  I don't have any ads for the show.
[02:28:07.590 --> 02:28:08.590]  No sponsors this month.
[02:28:08.590 --> 02:28:09.590]  What month is this?
[02:28:09.590 --> 02:28:10.590]  This is June.
[02:28:10.590 --> 02:28:11.590]  No sponsors for the month of June.
[02:28:11.590 --> 02:28:12.590]  If you would like to sponsor the show starting in the month of July, send me an email.
[02:28:12.590 --> 02:28:13.590]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.

[02:28:14.590 --> 02:28:15.590]  I'd love to have your product featured on the podcast.
[02:28:15.590 --> 02:28:16.590]  Let's see.
[02:28:16.590 --> 02:28:17.590]  We've got a bunch of news.
[02:28:17.590 --> 02:28:18.590]  It's going to be a news filled episode.
[02:28:18.590 --> 02:28:19.590]  Get ready for some news, y'all.
[02:28:19.590 --> 02:28:20.590]  Yes.
[02:28:20.590 --> 02:28:21.590]  I think my first news article is going to be pretty good or it'll be a good way to kick
[02:28:21.590 --> 02:28:22.590]  down the door.
[02:28:22.590 --> 02:28:23.590]  So we've talked about taking a poop.
[02:28:23.590 --> 02:28:24.590]  We've talked about taking a shit.
[02:28:24.590 --> 02:28:25.590]  We've talked about taking a shit.
[02:28:25.590 --> 02:28:26.590]  We've talked about taking a shit.
[02:28:26.590 --> 02:28:27.590]  We've talked about taking a shit.
[02:28:27.590 --> 02:28:28.590]  We've talked about taking a shit.
[02:28:28.590 --> 02:28:29.590]  We've talked about taking a shit.
[02:28:29.590 --> 02:28:53.790]  I'm going to take a small sip of some beverage here and get my throat nice and clear before
[02:28:53.790 --> 02:28:55.110]  we get into this news here.
[02:28:55.110 --> 02:28:57.630]  Mike, say something useful.
[02:28:57.630 --> 02:29:01.710]  This isn't quite a fair back and forth with me and Jeff right now.
[02:29:01.710 --> 02:29:06.990]  He has a laptop and a pile of notes and a smartphone that's linked to the Wi-Fi and
[02:29:06.990 --> 02:29:07.990]  I have my memory.
[02:29:07.990 --> 02:29:13.110]  You want me to pass you this pile of hash and a dabber and an email and then that can
[02:29:13.110 --> 02:29:14.110]  be your job.
[02:29:14.110 --> 02:29:17.510]  I'll keep the news and the show going and you can just keep us nice and dabbed.
[02:29:17.510 --> 02:29:19.190]  That's fair.
[02:29:19.190 --> 02:29:21.030]  I think that beverage dislodged something.
[02:29:21.030 --> 02:29:22.030]  I shouldn't even have done that.
[02:29:22.030 --> 02:29:23.790]  What do we got here now that it's in my control?
[02:29:23.790 --> 02:29:24.790]  Some more headband.
[02:29:24.790 --> 02:29:26.790]  I'll throw down this Durban Poison or the headband.
[02:29:26.790 --> 02:29:27.790]  We could dab you the one of those.
[02:29:27.790 --> 02:29:29.030]  That's so freaking good.
[02:29:29.030 --> 02:29:31.950]  Here's some Tora Bora, that's super high CBD sap stuff.
[02:29:31.950 --> 02:29:34.590]  Actually, I'm going to go with the Tora.
[02:29:34.590 --> 02:29:36.310]  If I can reach this bag.
[02:29:36.310 --> 02:29:40.070]  Until after we get done with the main news article for today's show.
[02:29:40.070 --> 02:29:41.470]  That's going to be hard to work with.
[02:29:41.470 --> 02:29:44.550]  It's a little sappier than what you're used to, but you'll figure it out.
[02:29:44.550 --> 02:29:53.070]  I've also got some AJ's Sour Diesel and I have got some...
[02:29:53.070 --> 02:29:54.070]  It's like honey.
[02:29:54.070 --> 02:29:55.070]  Oh, no.
[02:29:55.070 --> 02:29:56.470]  Just more Sour Diesel and more Durban Poison.
[02:29:57.150 --> 02:29:58.270]  I think you can tell what I like.
[02:29:58.270 --> 02:30:00.230]  I like these sativa dabs.
[02:30:00.230 --> 02:30:01.230]  So delicious.
[02:30:01.230 --> 02:30:04.030]  And that Durban was quite delicious.
[02:30:04.030 --> 02:30:05.030]  Thank you, Turpex.
[02:30:05.030 --> 02:30:06.030]  Yes.
[02:30:06.030 --> 02:30:07.030]  Shout out to the boys at Turpex.
[02:30:07.030 --> 02:30:08.030]  What up, Turpex boys?
[02:30:08.030 --> 02:30:10.310]  And shout out to my friends at Green and Healthy Wellness.
[02:30:10.310 --> 02:30:12.350]  Hunt, what's up, brother?
[02:30:12.350 --> 02:30:13.350]  Can't wait to see you again.
[02:30:13.350 --> 02:30:14.350]  What's up, Damsel?
[02:30:14.350 --> 02:30:15.470]  Hope you're doing well.
[02:30:15.470 --> 02:30:16.470]  What's up, John Randles Jr.?
[02:30:16.470 --> 02:30:17.470]  Hope you're doing well, brother.
[02:30:17.470 --> 02:30:20.070]  Hope you're playing some video games and having a great time.
[02:30:20.070 --> 02:30:22.670]  Hey, fellas, I saw the shop and I liked it.
[02:30:22.670 --> 02:30:23.670]  Keep up the good work.
[02:30:23.670 --> 02:30:24.670]  Yeah.
[02:30:24.670 --> 02:30:27.550]  If you're in Pueblo, Colorado, I recommend the Spot Dispensary in Pueblo West.
[02:30:27.550 --> 02:30:31.510]  But if you're in Colorado Springs and you're looking for good flowers and or concentrates,
[02:30:31.510 --> 02:30:34.750]  I definitely recommend that you hit Green and Healthy Wellness.
[02:30:34.750 --> 02:30:38.070]  It's on 212 South Colorado.
[02:30:38.070 --> 02:30:39.070]  Pretty sure that's the address.
[02:30:39.070 --> 02:30:41.430]  So go there, buy stuff, support the community.
[02:30:41.430 --> 02:30:42.630]  It's a medical only shop.
[02:30:42.630 --> 02:30:43.630]  I should mention that.
[02:30:43.630 --> 02:30:47.150]  You cannot get in there without a medical marijuana recommendation.
[02:30:47.150 --> 02:30:48.830]  Green and Healthy is medical.
[02:30:48.830 --> 02:30:50.830]  The Spot is rec.
[02:30:50.830 --> 02:30:52.590]  The Spot is recreational.
[02:30:52.590 --> 02:30:55.510]  Everybody can go to the Spot if you're 21 and up.
[02:30:55.510 --> 02:30:56.510]  Everybody go to the Spot.
[02:30:56.510 --> 02:30:57.510]  All right.
[02:30:57.510 --> 02:30:58.510]  Nobody's paying me to say this shit.
[02:30:58.510 --> 02:30:59.510]  Let's read the news.
[02:30:59.510 --> 02:31:04.110]  Here you go, you guys.
[02:31:04.110 --> 02:31:06.110]  If you don't mind, bro, would you throw me one of the derp and poisons?
[02:31:06.110 --> 02:31:07.110]  That's what I was going to say.
[02:31:07.110 --> 02:31:08.110]  Toss me another dab, would you, bro?
[02:31:08.110 --> 02:31:09.110]  There you go, bro.
[02:31:09.110 --> 02:31:10.110]  All right.
[02:31:10.110 --> 02:31:11.110]  So here's a great headline.
[02:31:11.110 --> 02:31:14.870]  One of the best headlines I've gotten to read on the show in a little while.
[02:31:14.870 --> 02:31:19.430]  It says, the US finally admits cannabis kills cancer cells.
[02:31:19.430 --> 02:31:24.790]  That is great news because now that they're admitting it, maybe we can start decriminalizing
[02:31:24.790 --> 02:31:27.470]  it and using it as medicine all over the country.
[02:31:27.470 --> 02:31:29.870]  Don't jump to conclusions, sir.
[02:31:29.870 --> 02:31:30.870]  These are hopes and dreams.
[02:31:30.870 --> 02:31:31.870]  I know.
[02:31:31.870 --> 02:31:32.870]  A man can dream, can't he?
[02:31:32.870 --> 02:31:33.870]  They really are.
[02:31:33.870 --> 02:31:37.550]  I sent you this and this was one of the highlights in my week was reading this story.
[02:31:37.550 --> 02:31:43.190]  I actually, I caught the journal article that it talks about a few months back, but I'm
[02:31:43.190 --> 02:31:45.030]  glad to see it start to make the press.
[02:31:45.030 --> 02:31:47.110]  Guys, that sound is parchment paper.
[02:31:47.110 --> 02:31:50.530]  How large a dab would you like, sir?
[02:31:50.530 --> 02:31:53.750]  Can you eyeball out a 0.3 if I told you a 0.3?
[02:31:53.750 --> 02:31:57.310]  No, but I just saw why they calls it shatter.
[02:31:57.310 --> 02:31:58.310]  Yes.
[02:31:58.310 --> 02:32:01.750]  The tip of the dabber will chip the shatter in your eye.
[02:32:01.750 --> 02:32:02.750]  That's a good dab.
[02:32:02.750 --> 02:32:03.750]  I'd probably say that's like 0.2.
[02:32:03.750 --> 02:32:04.750]  Nice try.
[02:32:04.750 --> 02:32:05.750]  That's good enough for me.
[02:32:05.750 --> 02:32:06.750]  I appreciate it.
[02:32:06.750 --> 02:32:07.750]  That was the piece that came off nice and smooth.
[02:32:07.750 --> 02:32:08.750]  Gorgeous.
[02:32:08.750 --> 02:32:09.750]  All right.
[02:32:09.750 --> 02:32:12.270]  So I should probably read the news article I've teased you guys about.
[02:32:12.270 --> 02:32:15.950]  So it says, a group of federal researchers commissioned by the government to prove that
[02:32:15.950 --> 02:32:21.990]  cannabis has no accepted medical use may have unwittingly let information slip through
[02:32:21.990 --> 02:32:25.630]  the cracks, revealing how cannabis actually kills cancer cells.
[02:32:25.630 --> 02:32:31.190]  So this is the beautiful thing about kind of how we got here.
[02:32:31.190 --> 02:32:35.190]  Just to step back for a second and do my obnoxious thing.
[02:32:35.190 --> 02:32:37.550]  That's great because I want to dab.
[02:32:37.550 --> 02:32:43.430]  I saw you wanting it, so I grabbed the mic.
[02:32:43.430 --> 02:32:51.910]  Most fanatics and supporters and advocates don't get to do federal research studies.
[02:32:51.910 --> 02:32:56.390]  Researchers do, and the feds have blocked most research not looking for harm.
[02:32:56.390 --> 02:33:00.590]  So all the studies we have showing how safe cannabis is and what an effective medicine
[02:33:00.590 --> 02:33:06.270]  it is, most of those studies are studies that were like, find out that it proves or that
[02:33:06.270 --> 02:33:07.550]  it causes lung cancer.
[02:33:07.550 --> 02:33:08.550]  That's your job.
[02:33:08.550 --> 02:33:09.990]  Find that link.
[02:33:09.990 --> 02:33:14.830]  And then one of the top researchers spends a couple of years looking at cannabis use
[02:33:14.830 --> 02:33:20.990]  in lung function and finds out that it doesn't cause cancer, that it increases lung function.
[02:33:20.990 --> 02:33:24.510]  It's just one of those fun things about cannabis, and this is another great example.
[02:33:24.510 --> 02:33:25.510]  All right.
[02:33:25.510 --> 02:33:26.510]  I'm recovered from my dab.
[02:33:26.510 --> 02:33:27.510]  Nice fill in.
[02:33:27.510 --> 02:33:28.510]  Thank you.
[02:33:28.510 --> 02:33:29.510]  Do it.
[02:33:29.510 --> 02:33:30.510]  All right.
[02:33:30.510 --> 02:33:34.170]  It says, the research, which was conducted by a team of scientists at St. George's University
[02:33:34.170 --> 02:33:39.150]  of London, found that the two most common cannabinoids in marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol,
[02:33:39.310 --> 02:33:44.150]  which is THC, and cannabidiol, which is our favorite CBD, weakened the ferocity of cancer
[02:33:44.150 --> 02:33:50.090]  cells and made them more susceptible to radiation treatment, said Mike Adams of Herbal Dispatch.
[02:33:50.090 --> 02:33:56.830]  So the main two cannabinoids in marijuana, they say marijuana a lot in this article,
[02:33:56.830 --> 02:34:03.310]  in cannabis weaken the ferocity of cancer cells and make them more susceptible to radiation
[02:34:03.310 --> 02:34:04.310]  treatment.
[02:34:04.310 --> 02:34:08.510]  So cannabis is kicking cancer's ass is what it's saying right there, right?
[02:34:09.030 --> 02:34:10.470]  That's exactly what it's saying.
[02:34:10.470 --> 02:34:11.950]  Making it it's bitch.
[02:34:11.950 --> 02:34:18.410]  And this is not the first research study to find exactly that, that something in the marijuana
[02:34:18.410 --> 02:34:24.790]  plant likely THC or CBD is triggering what they call apoptosis.
[02:34:24.790 --> 02:34:32.210]  And that's when a cell in your body is supposed to die, apoptosis happens and the cell dies.
[02:34:32.210 --> 02:34:34.190]  It's replaced by a new cell.
[02:34:34.190 --> 02:34:35.190]  Everything's great.
[02:34:35.190 --> 02:34:38.190]  Cancer, the cell doesn't die and grows out of control.
[02:34:38.870 --> 02:34:41.150]  Apoptosis triggers the cells, tells it it's time to die.
[02:34:41.150 --> 02:34:46.350]  The second federal medical marijuana patient ever has been shouting this from the rooftops
[02:34:46.350 --> 02:34:47.910]  for years.
[02:34:47.910 --> 02:34:48.910]  Is that a Irv?
[02:34:48.910 --> 02:34:49.910]  That's Irv.
[02:34:49.910 --> 02:34:50.910]  Shout out to Irv.
[02:34:50.910 --> 02:34:51.910]  Irv and Rosenfeld, everybody.
[02:34:51.910 --> 02:34:54.030]  If you haven't heard that name before, Google it.
[02:34:54.030 --> 02:34:55.030]  Google it, read his book.
[02:34:55.030 --> 02:34:56.030]  I recommend it.
[02:34:56.030 --> 02:34:58.310]  His story will blow your fucking mind.
[02:34:58.310 --> 02:34:59.310]  There you go.
[02:34:59.310 --> 02:35:00.350]  Read more books, you guys.
[02:35:00.350 --> 02:35:04.470]  He gets to smoke joints at a special room in Disneyland, people.
[02:35:04.470 --> 02:35:09.590]  He took the US federal government to court and said, cannabis is the best medicine for
[02:35:09.590 --> 02:35:10.590]  me.
[02:35:10.590 --> 02:35:11.590]  Fuck you, tell me otherwise.
[02:35:11.590 --> 02:35:16.750]  And won in federal court and can smoke joints anywhere, on the road, at work, across from
[02:35:16.750 --> 02:35:18.510]  the DEA headquarters.
[02:35:18.510 --> 02:35:19.510]  At the DEA headquarters.
[02:35:19.510 --> 02:35:21.190]  He's a stockbroker.
[02:35:21.190 --> 02:35:25.430]  Anywhere you're allowed to consume tobacco, he's allowed to consume cannabis.
[02:35:25.430 --> 02:35:28.590]  The feds ship him 11 ounces a month for free.
[02:35:28.590 --> 02:35:29.590]  For free?
[02:35:29.590 --> 02:35:30.590]  For free.
[02:35:30.590 --> 02:35:33.110]  I've seen that Irv and you couldn't pay me to smoke it.
[02:35:33.110 --> 02:35:34.110]  True.
[02:35:34.750 --> 02:35:37.390]  11 ounces a month for free.
[02:35:37.390 --> 02:35:38.830]  It's exactly what it needs.
[02:35:38.830 --> 02:35:39.830]  It's kept him alive.
[02:35:39.830 --> 02:35:42.070]  He'd be dead without it.
[02:35:42.070 --> 02:35:45.870]  He's the world record holder for most joints smoked in a lifetime.
[02:35:45.870 --> 02:35:48.830]  Like, sorry, Snoop, but Irv's record's confirmed.
[02:35:48.830 --> 02:35:49.830]  He gets the gold.
[02:35:49.830 --> 02:35:51.710]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:35:51.710 --> 02:35:58.110]  Snoop's probably smoked the most blunts and also post the most Instagram posts.
[02:35:58.110 --> 02:35:59.670]  That's an award Snoop can win for sure.
[02:35:59.670 --> 02:36:01.470]  All right, I'm going to read more of this article.
[02:36:01.470 --> 02:36:07.230]  It says, the study, which was published last year in the medical journal, Molecular Cancer
[02:36:07.230 --> 02:36:11.750]  Therapies details the dramatic reductions in fatal variations of brain cancer when these
[02:36:11.750 --> 02:36:16.830]  specific cannabinoids were used in conjunction with radiation therapy.
[02:36:16.830 --> 02:36:21.990]  So they didn't try it without radiation, but it said it helped with radiation in conjunction.
[02:36:21.990 --> 02:36:25.230]  So marijuana can kill certain cancer cells.
[02:36:25.230 --> 02:36:28.750]  We've shown that cannabinoids could play a role in treating one of the most aggressive
[02:36:28.750 --> 02:36:33.030]  cancers in adults, wrote lead researcher, Dr. Wei Li.
[02:36:33.030 --> 02:36:34.030]  I hope I said that right.
[02:36:34.030 --> 02:36:35.030]  I apologize.
[02:36:35.030 --> 02:36:39.790]  In a November, 2014 op-ed for the Washington Post, the results are promising.
[02:36:39.790 --> 02:36:45.910]  It could provide a way of breaking through gyloma tumors and saving more lives.
[02:36:45.910 --> 02:36:47.230]  And then here's a little sub headline.
[02:36:47.230 --> 02:36:50.630]  It says, recent animal studies have shown that marijuana can kill certain cancer cells
[02:36:50.630 --> 02:36:52.790]  and reduce the size of others.
[02:36:52.790 --> 02:36:58.030]  The NIDA report said, evidence from one animal study suggests that extracts from whole plant
[02:36:58.310 --> 02:37:01.590]  marijuana can shrink one of the most serious types of brain tumors.
[02:37:01.590 --> 02:37:06.110]  Research in mice showed that these extracts, when used with radiation, increased the cancer
[02:37:06.110 --> 02:37:09.830]  killing effects of the radiation.
[02:37:09.830 --> 02:37:16.470]  Then it goes on to say, NIDA's new found pro-pot position is especially curious given that
[02:37:16.470 --> 02:37:20.950]  it was revealed on the heels of a recent proposal introduced to both Congress and the House
[02:37:20.950 --> 02:37:25.710]  of Representatives, which attempts to legalize medical marijuana on a national level.
[02:37:25.710 --> 02:37:31.350]  The bill, which is called the Carriers Act, the Carriers Act, I'm sorry, seeks to downgrade
[02:37:31.350 --> 02:37:35.310]  the schedule one status of marijuana to a schedule two in order to make the herb more
[02:37:35.310 --> 02:37:40.150]  flexible in the eyes of the federal government as an acceptable form of medicine.
[02:37:40.150 --> 02:37:46.310]  In addition, the bill would also remove cannabidiol, the non-intoxicating compound of the pot plant.
[02:37:46.310 --> 02:37:49.310]  Somebody finally said compound and didn't call it a fucking ingredient.
[02:37:49.310 --> 02:37:50.310]  I'm proud of these people.
[02:37:50.310 --> 02:37:51.310]  That's awesome.
[02:37:51.310 --> 02:37:52.990]  It's nice to see somebody finally get that one right.
[02:37:52.990 --> 02:37:56.710]  I wonder if they heard the podcast, if somebody heard me call them out, because I used the
[02:37:56.710 --> 02:37:57.710]  word compound.
[02:37:57.710 --> 02:37:59.390]  I was like, they should say compound.
[02:37:59.390 --> 02:38:04.790]  Anyway, they are removing cannabidiol, the non-intoxicating compound of the pot plant,
[02:38:04.790 --> 02:38:09.670]  from the Controlled Substances Act to allow it to be distributed on a state to state basis
[02:38:09.670 --> 02:38:12.890]  without violating federal statutes.
[02:38:12.890 --> 02:38:16.430]  Cannabis became a schedule one drug in 1970 with the passing of the Controlled Substances
[02:38:16.430 --> 02:38:21.350]  Act, which classified cannabis as having a high potential for abuse, no medical usage,
[02:38:21.350 --> 02:38:24.350]  and unsafe to use without medical supervision.
[02:38:24.350 --> 02:38:31.590]  This federal research basically contradicts cannabis's schedule one status.
[02:38:31.590 --> 02:38:35.390]  Could this mean reform is closer than we'd originally imagined?
[02:38:35.390 --> 02:38:39.230]  So yeah, is this the floodgate right here for cannabis reform now that we have found
[02:38:39.230 --> 02:38:42.350]  out that it actually does kill cancer?
[02:38:42.350 --> 02:38:44.630]  No.
[02:38:44.630 --> 02:38:50.590]  And I say that with absolutely no doubt, because we've had ... The federal government holds
[02:38:50.590 --> 02:38:54.110]  a patent for cannabis as a neuroprotectant.
[02:38:54.110 --> 02:38:55.110]  That's kind of where I was headed.
[02:38:55.110 --> 02:38:56.790]  They have for years.
[02:38:56.790 --> 02:39:00.910]  The federal medical marijuana program is as old as I am.
[02:39:00.910 --> 02:39:04.230]  It's 32, 33 years old now.
[02:39:04.230 --> 02:39:05.910]  They've known a lot of this for decades.
[02:39:05.910 --> 02:39:06.910]  They don't care.
[02:39:06.910 --> 02:39:08.470]  They just don't want to admit it.
[02:39:08.470 --> 02:39:12.150]  And now if they do admit it, do you think that that's going to open the pharmaceutical
[02:39:12.150 --> 02:39:16.870]  company floodgates to where they want to make and patent cannabis products?
[02:39:16.870 --> 02:39:25.710]  I think as soon as it tips federally legal, the pharma industry, the tobacco industry,
[02:39:25.710 --> 02:39:30.830]  everybody's going to try to jump in it if they can or if they have the desire to.
[02:39:30.830 --> 02:39:31.870]  A lot of people won't.
[02:39:31.870 --> 02:39:36.150]  There's still that big ... It's immoral.
[02:39:36.150 --> 02:39:40.390]  But I don't think any of the ... If you put big and then capitalize the name of the industry,
[02:39:40.390 --> 02:39:41.790]  I don't think they're going to care.
[02:39:41.790 --> 02:39:44.470]  The tobacco industry is not moral.
[02:39:44.470 --> 02:39:45.670]  They're killing you anyway.
[02:39:46.070 --> 02:39:49.950]  If they've got one more product they can sell you, because they're not going to lose cigarette
[02:39:49.950 --> 02:39:50.950]  smokers.
[02:39:50.950 --> 02:39:52.350]  What do you want to do right after we get stoned?
[02:39:52.350 --> 02:39:54.270]  The first thing you want to do is fucking smoke a cigarette.
[02:39:54.270 --> 02:39:57.390]  So now they'll have two products to sell you and you're going to be buying them all day
[02:39:57.390 --> 02:39:58.670]  long.
[02:39:58.670 --> 02:40:00.350]  You don't think that ... Who is it?
[02:40:00.350 --> 02:40:02.710]  Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds are those cigarette companies?
[02:40:02.710 --> 02:40:03.710]  The two rings a bell in my head.
[02:40:03.710 --> 02:40:04.710]  They are.
[02:40:04.710 --> 02:40:05.710]  No, you got ... You pulled two names, correct names.
[02:40:05.710 --> 02:40:06.710]  I guess.
[02:40:06.710 --> 02:40:09.510]  Do you think those guys, the Alpha Brain dude, we're going to attribute that to Alpha Brain.
[02:40:09.510 --> 02:40:10.510]  Do you think-
[02:40:10.510 --> 02:40:13.630]  Attribute that shit to advertising, motherfucker.
[02:40:13.630 --> 02:40:15.070]  Do you think those guys are lined up?
[02:40:15.470 --> 02:40:16.470]  They're like fucking-
[02:40:16.470 --> 02:40:17.470]  Yes and no.
[02:40:17.470 --> 02:40:19.470]  They're the football team at the scrimmage line ready to run.
[02:40:19.470 --> 02:40:23.030]  As soon as someone says hike, they're going to go.
[02:40:23.030 --> 02:40:26.830]  There's definite evidence that different tobacco companies are definitely looking into marijuana
[02:40:26.830 --> 02:40:29.350]  legalization and have been since the 70s.
[02:40:29.350 --> 02:40:31.310]  Because we got really close in the 70s.
[02:40:31.310 --> 02:40:33.190]  Nobody seems to remember this.
[02:40:33.190 --> 02:40:37.270]  Jimmy Carter almost was the president who legalized it, almost.
[02:40:37.270 --> 02:40:38.270]  I wasn't there for that.
[02:40:38.270 --> 02:40:39.270]  I showed up late.
[02:40:39.270 --> 02:40:43.150]  I wasn't there for that either, but it's part of the history.
[02:40:43.230 --> 02:40:46.030]  But yeah, where the fuck were we?
[02:40:46.030 --> 02:40:47.030]  I just dabbed out for a minute.
[02:40:47.030 --> 02:40:48.870]  Oh man, I saw you look at your hand.
[02:40:48.870 --> 02:40:51.710]  You looked at your fingernails like, I'm not sure what I'm saying right now.
[02:40:51.710 --> 02:40:52.710]  Yep.
[02:40:52.710 --> 02:40:53.710]  All right.
[02:40:53.710 --> 02:40:57.670]  Now they have found out that cannabis will kill cancer cells and we're worried that it's
[02:40:57.670 --> 02:40:59.710]  going to go to the pharmaceutical companies.
[02:40:59.710 --> 02:41:01.710]  Big tobacco's going to jump in and it goes-
[02:41:01.710 --> 02:41:04.190]  Oh no, the tobacco company's been looking at it in the 70s.
[02:41:04.190 --> 02:41:05.190]  That's where the fuck I was going.
[02:41:05.190 --> 02:41:06.190]  There you go.
[02:41:06.190 --> 02:41:12.190]  But never seriously, there's some serious problems with ... A lot of people just assume, oh,
[02:41:12.230 --> 02:41:17.510]  all Marlboro has to do is plant huge fields of sour diesel and then they can put out cartons
[02:41:17.510 --> 02:41:18.510]  of Marlboro.
[02:41:18.510 --> 02:41:19.510]  It's just like, no.
[02:41:19.510 --> 02:41:21.390]  A, it doesn't grow like tobacco.
[02:41:21.390 --> 02:41:22.870]  B, it doesn't dry like tobacco.
[02:41:22.870 --> 02:41:24.310]  C, it doesn't cure like tobacco.
[02:41:24.310 --> 02:41:27.190]  D, it doesn't roll through the same machines as tobacco.
[02:41:27.190 --> 02:41:31.790]  They would literally have to build the whole infrastructure up from scratch.
[02:41:31.790 --> 02:41:34.390]  They can't just convert their existing.
[02:41:34.390 --> 02:41:40.950]  So there's that hurdle for everybody on top of which Colorado Dixie Elixirs is already,
[02:41:40.950 --> 02:41:43.310]  I mean, they're already done.
[02:41:43.310 --> 02:41:44.350]  They're already set up.
[02:41:44.350 --> 02:41:46.670]  All that infrastructure is already built.
[02:41:46.670 --> 02:41:51.670]  So at this point, Marlboro has to catch up to Dixie.
[02:41:51.670 --> 02:41:52.750]  That's just the reality.
[02:41:52.750 --> 02:41:57.430]  There are some pharma companies in Great Britain that are light years ahead of the rest of
[02:41:57.430 --> 02:42:03.190]  the industry, but that's because Great Britain has much better research rules than we do.
[02:42:03.190 --> 02:42:09.710]  So back in the day, I used to see on Facebook and shit, used to see pictures of Marlboro
[02:42:09.870 --> 02:42:11.750]  having weed packages already made.
[02:42:11.750 --> 02:42:14.390]  Was that real do you think, or is that just some stuff that somebody made?
[02:42:14.390 --> 02:42:15.750]  It's just a Photoshop mock-up.
[02:42:15.750 --> 02:42:21.510]  There was a company out of Colorado that was attempting to put together a pack of cigarettes
[02:42:21.510 --> 02:42:24.310]  filled with cannabis.
[02:42:24.310 --> 02:42:28.790]  I believe they were to the marketing to dispensary stage the last time I heard about them.
[02:42:28.790 --> 02:42:33.830]  I don't know if they were to go fund me stage and the guy was over pitching it at the restaurant
[02:42:33.830 --> 02:42:36.350]  or what, but I've heard they're on the market.
[02:42:36.350 --> 02:42:38.190]  I don't go to shops enough to know.
[02:42:38.190 --> 02:42:39.190]  Right.
[02:42:39.670 --> 02:42:43.230]  I guess I do go to a shop often because at work and one, but I don't pay attention to
[02:42:43.230 --> 02:42:44.230]  the products.
[02:42:44.230 --> 02:42:45.790]  I didn't see any green and healthy wellness.
[02:42:45.790 --> 02:42:48.230]  I'll tell you that much.
[02:42:48.230 --> 02:42:49.230]  All right.
[02:42:49.230 --> 02:42:51.550]  Let's jump out of this one.
[02:42:51.550 --> 02:42:54.510]  Big up to cannabinoids and fuck you cancer.
[02:42:54.510 --> 02:42:56.190]  That's why I want to wrap up that article.
[02:42:56.190 --> 02:42:57.190]  Yeah.
[02:42:57.190 --> 02:42:59.270]  Shout out to cannabinoids.
[02:42:59.270 --> 02:43:00.270]  Where's another one?
[02:43:00.270 --> 02:43:01.270]  So there's another article.
[02:43:01.270 --> 02:43:05.630]  This one is from The Cannabis and of course it is written by our good friend, Ricardo
[02:43:05.630 --> 02:43:08.190]  Baca.
[02:43:08.190 --> 02:43:12.630]  This article kind of sparked some controversy and we'll get into the controversy right after.
[02:43:12.630 --> 02:43:17.510]  The headline is, is this central Denver's first 420 friendly hotel?
[02:43:17.510 --> 02:43:20.590]  Sub headline is smoke, vape and edibles on the balcony.
[02:43:20.590 --> 02:43:22.430]  It's all good at native hotel.
[02:43:22.430 --> 02:43:26.670]  Denver's a downtown Denver's first outwardly 420 friendly hotel.
[02:43:26.670 --> 02:43:31.390]  Then it says many in Colorado's bustling cannabis industry have complained about the lack of
[02:43:31.390 --> 02:43:34.590]  marijuana friendly hotels in this state and others.
[02:43:34.590 --> 02:43:35.590]  It's a problem.
[02:43:35.590 --> 02:43:36.590]  It is a problem.
[02:43:36.590 --> 02:43:38.750]  There's cannabis on every corner in Denver.
[02:43:38.750 --> 02:43:43.590]  If you drive down federal, if you drive down Broadway, if you go down Colorado Boulevard,
[02:43:43.590 --> 02:43:47.030]  it's, I mean, in some areas it's more than every corner.
[02:43:47.030 --> 02:43:49.030]  Yeah, very true.
[02:43:49.030 --> 02:43:51.110]  It's a green mile.
[02:43:51.110 --> 02:43:52.110]  Yeah.
[02:43:52.110 --> 02:43:54.230]  Little, little, uh, broadster damn there.
[02:43:54.230 --> 02:43:59.630]  It's like a Starbucks and then a car dealership and then a fucking, uh, dispensary.
[02:43:59.630 --> 02:44:01.310]  And then what else is there up there in Denver?
[02:44:01.310 --> 02:44:02.310]  A little art studio.
[02:44:02.310 --> 02:44:03.310]  Yeah.
[02:44:03.310 --> 02:44:04.310]  A little art studio or something.
[02:44:04.310 --> 02:44:05.710]  But yeah, it's all a tattoo shop.
[02:44:05.830 --> 02:44:06.830]  That's what I was going to say.
[02:44:06.830 --> 02:44:09.710]  It was, was what was on my brain at fucking tattoo store.
[02:44:09.710 --> 02:44:14.750]  There are all these places to buy cannabis, but the only place to smoke it legally is
[02:44:14.750 --> 02:44:15.750]  at your house.
[02:44:15.750 --> 02:44:16.750]  Take it home.
[02:44:16.750 --> 02:44:22.150]  And if you just drove from Texas, you, you ain't got no home.
[02:44:22.150 --> 02:44:27.430]  And imagine having, uh, you just drove how many hours from Texas, whatever, 10, 12 hours.
[02:44:27.430 --> 02:44:29.070]  You get here, it's hot.
[02:44:29.070 --> 02:44:31.550]  You hit the dispensary, your mind's blown.
[02:44:31.550 --> 02:44:35.670]  You get out to the parking lot in, you're not going to wait 10 to 14 hours.
[02:44:35.670 --> 02:44:38.430]  You drive home and smoke that first Colorado.
[02:44:38.430 --> 02:44:40.070]  That's a different special crime.
[02:44:40.070 --> 02:44:41.070]  Yeah.
[02:44:41.070 --> 02:44:42.070]  You can't even do that.
[02:44:42.070 --> 02:44:43.070]  Right?
[02:44:43.070 --> 02:44:44.070]  So you go, you've got to find accommodations.
[02:44:44.070 --> 02:44:48.430]  And I mean, how many Airbnb places are in Pueblo?
[02:44:48.430 --> 02:44:49.430]  Yeah.
[02:44:49.430 --> 02:44:53.590]  I mean, you're, you're screwed when you need a place to stay.
[02:44:53.590 --> 02:44:56.870]  This is a big, this is a need that needs filling people.
[02:44:56.870 --> 02:44:57.870]  Right.
[02:44:57.870 --> 02:45:01.390]  So the, uh, the next line here says, but Keef Cola partner, Richmond Meyer is actually doing
[02:45:01.390 --> 02:45:02.630]  something about it.
[02:45:02.630 --> 02:45:07.950]  He's opening native hotel this week in downtown Denver, Denver boasting that half of its 16
[02:45:07.950 --> 02:45:11.350]  rooms have weed friendly balconies.
[02:45:11.350 --> 02:45:14.350]  If you do it right, every hotel has a weed friendly balcony.
[02:45:14.350 --> 02:45:16.890]  So here's my issue with the balcony.
[02:45:16.890 --> 02:45:23.270]  So you're a tourist, you're new, we're going to stick you on the balcony and give you crazy
[02:45:23.270 --> 02:45:25.990]  good weed at altitude.
[02:45:25.990 --> 02:45:27.310]  So we're setting you up for a dive.
[02:45:27.310 --> 02:45:30.950]  How many different ways can we set ourselves up for failure in this industry?
[02:45:31.270 --> 02:45:33.110]  We can't bank.
[02:45:33.110 --> 02:45:34.390]  We're incredibly popular.
[02:45:34.390 --> 02:45:37.870]  So we're essentially giant buildings full of weed and money.
[02:45:37.870 --> 02:45:42.350]  Like what jackass with a big gun and a tiny deck doesn't want a big building full of weed
[02:45:42.350 --> 02:45:47.390]  and money to rob and still somehow like the robbery rates lower than seven 11s.
[02:45:47.390 --> 02:45:49.790]  Have you seen the security guards at the spot?
[02:45:49.790 --> 02:45:52.070]  True, but they ain't there now.
[02:45:52.070 --> 02:45:53.070]  They are.
[02:45:53.070 --> 02:45:58.590]  Well, there was a, I saw Mark Emery's post from yesterday on Facebook, one of his friends
[02:45:58.590 --> 02:46:02.510]  dispensaries in Vancouver, somebody drove a truck through the front of it.
[02:46:02.510 --> 02:46:08.670]  They apprehended the guy in a different dispensary doing the same shit a second time in a night.
[02:46:08.670 --> 02:46:09.670]  Yeah.
[02:46:09.670 --> 02:46:14.350]  What a, what a fun place Vancouver must be.
[02:46:14.350 --> 02:46:17.390]  But I mean, how many different ways we can, can we set ourselves up for failure?
[02:46:17.390 --> 02:46:21.790]  Like the last thing you want is a newbie from Texas on edibles on a balcony.
[02:46:21.790 --> 02:46:23.430]  That's very true.
[02:46:23.430 --> 02:46:24.590]  My high ass on a balcony.
[02:46:24.590 --> 02:46:26.990]  I'm going to drop the pipe right off that son of a bitch.
[02:46:26.990 --> 02:46:27.990]  All right.
[02:46:27.990 --> 02:46:30.430]  Heads up, brother ship coming down.
[02:46:30.430 --> 02:46:31.430]  One year we were at a hotel.
[02:46:31.430 --> 02:46:34.470]  I'm not going to say the name of the hotel, but it's a popular hotel in Denver.
[02:46:34.470 --> 02:46:37.590]  Here's a dab or go for it.
[02:46:37.590 --> 02:46:40.950]  And we had all the rooms full in one area.
[02:46:40.950 --> 02:46:46.190]  Like this whole hallway was all dab kids from the cannabis industry and upstairs was all
[02:46:46.190 --> 02:46:47.190]  dad kids.
[02:46:47.190 --> 02:46:49.990]  And somebody was like, Hey bro, you got any butane?
[02:46:49.990 --> 02:46:50.990]  And nobody answered.
[02:46:50.990 --> 02:46:53.470]  And one guy up above goes, I got a can bro.
[02:46:53.910 --> 02:46:56.670]  And the guy goes, drop it down.
[02:46:56.670 --> 02:46:58.790]  And everybody got quiet.
[02:46:58.790 --> 02:47:04.750]  You see two arms go over the balcony and he goes scoot over and the guy scooted over and
[02:47:04.750 --> 02:47:08.390]  he dropped the can of butane and that shit landed right in the dude below him.
[02:47:08.390 --> 02:47:09.990]  His hand below his hand.
[02:47:09.990 --> 02:47:10.990]  It was great.
[02:47:10.990 --> 02:47:11.990]  That was awesome.
[02:47:11.990 --> 02:47:15.850]  So yeah, that's a random bout, but most of these Texas stoners or Nebraska stoners that
[02:47:15.850 --> 02:47:19.350]  just took their first dab in a hotel are not going to be able to catch or deal with the
[02:47:19.350 --> 02:47:20.350]  balcony.
[02:47:20.350 --> 02:47:21.350]  You might be right.
[02:47:21.350 --> 02:47:22.350]  Oh, it's ground level.
[02:47:23.230 --> 02:47:26.230]  Yeah, they don't even need stairs.
[02:47:26.230 --> 02:47:32.230]  The need for consumption clubs and cannabis friendly hotel accommodations is massive here.
[02:47:32.230 --> 02:47:34.790]  And we're going to jump out of the article and just kind of rant on that.
[02:47:34.790 --> 02:47:36.430]  That's where I was headed with this.
[02:47:36.430 --> 02:47:38.590]  So we can have a, and I'm not trying to bash on the hotel here.
[02:47:38.590 --> 02:47:43.190]  I sound like I'm snitching on the hotel and talking shit, but why can we have a cannabis
[02:47:43.190 --> 02:47:45.350]  friendly hotel, but we cannot.
[02:47:45.350 --> 02:47:49.430]  You're fighting with that mic dab rig, email combo so hard to do it.
[02:47:49.430 --> 02:47:50.430]  You're going to be a champ.
[02:47:50.430 --> 02:47:51.430]  You're going to get an award.
[02:47:51.510 --> 02:47:52.510]  I'm going to get a shot of my face so hard.
[02:47:53.510 --> 02:47:57.550]  All right, so we can have this hotel, but we cannot have the smokers clubs that were
[02:47:57.550 --> 02:47:58.550]  in Denver.
[02:47:58.550 --> 02:47:59.550]  POTUS got in trouble.
[02:47:59.550 --> 02:48:02.830]  POTUS was where everybody used to be able to go and dab.
[02:48:02.830 --> 02:48:05.990]  There was another speakeasy that I recently went to and spoke of.
[02:48:05.990 --> 02:48:10.070]  They recently got told that they couldn't smoke in there anymore or they would be dealt
[02:48:10.070 --> 02:48:11.070]  with.
[02:48:11.070 --> 02:48:14.150]  The grassroots break room got shut down.
[02:48:14.150 --> 02:48:17.430]  So all of the smoking clubs, Mike's telling me to kill his mic because he's going to cough.
[02:48:17.430 --> 02:48:18.430]  There you go.
[02:48:18.430 --> 02:48:19.430]  You're good, bro.
[02:48:19.430 --> 02:48:20.430]  Cough it out.
[02:48:20.430 --> 02:48:22.430]  The echo reduced.
[02:48:22.430 --> 02:48:26.430]  All these smoking clubs have been shut down, but we can have a hotel.
[02:48:26.430 --> 02:48:29.110]  So that doesn't make sense to me.
[02:48:29.110 --> 02:48:31.430]  Mike has given me a thumbs up that I could put his mic back on.
[02:48:31.430 --> 02:48:32.430]  I recovered-ish.
[02:48:32.430 --> 02:48:33.430]  Nice.
[02:48:33.430 --> 02:48:36.710]  You should see the size dab mic, size dabs Mike takes.
[02:48:36.710 --> 02:48:37.870]  They're super tiny.
[02:48:37.870 --> 02:48:40.110]  They're dabs for ants and he chokes like a champ.
[02:48:40.110 --> 02:48:41.110]  Tobacco kill.
[02:48:41.110 --> 02:48:42.670]  Yeah, you guys quit smoking tobacco.
[02:48:42.670 --> 02:48:43.670]  Get healthy.
[02:48:43.670 --> 02:48:45.670]  Dude, run some laps, spit that shit out and get off the tobacco.
[02:48:45.670 --> 02:48:47.790]  You're getting too old for this.
[02:48:47.790 --> 02:48:48.790]  Tobacco kill.
[02:48:48.790 --> 02:48:49.790]  Yeah, it's going to kill you.
[02:48:50.150 --> 02:48:51.710]  You got some reasons to live now.
[02:48:51.710 --> 02:48:52.710]  It's time to quit smoking.
[02:48:52.710 --> 02:48:53.710]  Yep.
[02:48:53.710 --> 02:48:54.710]  All right.
[02:48:54.710 --> 02:48:59.430]  So while some downtown Denver hotels quietly allow marijuana friendly tours, tour operators
[02:48:59.430 --> 02:49:03.390]  to book vape friendly rooms, Native will be Central Denver's first outwardly friendly
[02:49:03.390 --> 02:49:04.390]  hotel.
[02:49:04.390 --> 02:49:08.190]  The charm of Native Hotel is that the owners are in the business, said Meyer, who is an
[02:49:08.190 --> 02:49:11.390]  owner, partner and investor in a number of cannabis related ventures.
[02:49:11.390 --> 02:49:14.390]  Well, you see they got sick of answering the question.
[02:49:14.390 --> 02:49:15.390]  Right.
[02:49:15.390 --> 02:49:17.070]  With we don't know, we don't have an answer.
[02:49:17.070 --> 02:49:18.510]  Good luck finding it.
[02:49:18.510 --> 02:49:19.510]  Yep.
[02:49:20.230 --> 02:49:22.230]  Your business card is a way better answer.
[02:49:22.230 --> 02:49:23.230]  Yeah.
[02:49:23.230 --> 02:49:24.230]  Flip it over.
[02:49:24.230 --> 02:49:25.590]  It tells you what else I do.
[02:49:25.590 --> 02:49:27.550]  I've got a hotel right over here.
[02:49:27.550 --> 02:49:30.950]  Man, so we can pretty much just go rent the hotel for the day.
[02:49:30.950 --> 02:49:33.270]  You know, you got to pay for the whole night and shit, but then it'd just be a spot to
[02:49:33.270 --> 02:49:34.270]  go chill and dab.
[02:49:34.270 --> 02:49:36.550]  That's a little expensive unless you're doing all right.
[02:49:36.550 --> 02:49:37.550]  You don't have a ballroom.
[02:49:37.550 --> 02:49:39.950]  I hope they got plenty of ballroom.
[02:49:39.950 --> 02:49:40.950]  All right.
[02:49:40.950 --> 02:49:41.950]  Bad roster.
[02:49:41.950 --> 02:49:44.710]  We embrace the culture.
[02:49:44.710 --> 02:49:45.710]  We embrace the industry.
[02:49:45.710 --> 02:49:49.190]  We embrace the plant and everything that's coming along with it.
[02:49:49.870 --> 02:49:52.790]  The CanBrea Cafe, a five star hotel opening in the former Jet Hotel space at 1612 Wazee
[02:49:52.790 --> 02:49:57.630]  Street in Denver's Loto neighborhood will hardly be a weed free for all, but half of
[02:49:57.630 --> 02:50:00.310]  its rooms will have cannabis friendly balconies.
[02:50:00.310 --> 02:50:02.990]  No smoking inside, please.
[02:50:02.990 --> 02:50:09.230]  And it's CanBrea Cafe will serve coffee infused with imported cannabidiol or CBD.
[02:50:09.230 --> 02:50:14.230]  So you have your terpenes and your CBD and it's getting infused in 10 milligram dosages
[02:50:14.230 --> 02:50:16.990]  into four of our coffees, said Meyer.
[02:50:16.990 --> 02:50:21.670]  My partner has concocted different elixirs for different situations like hangover drinks.
[02:50:21.670 --> 02:50:25.870]  Yeah, that's that hemp juice they sell on the net.
[02:50:25.870 --> 02:50:28.550]  Oh, since it's CBD, they can sell it, right?
[02:50:28.550 --> 02:50:30.670]  Since it's not THC, it qualifies as hemp.
[02:50:30.670 --> 02:50:32.070]  Is that how they're getting away with it?
[02:50:32.070 --> 02:50:33.070]  Yeah.
[02:50:33.070 --> 02:50:37.310]  You're allowed to grow hemp in most industrialized nations and they've been squeezing CBD out
[02:50:37.310 --> 02:50:39.270]  of it since it hits Sanjay Gupta's.
[02:50:39.270 --> 02:50:43.550]  Because I was going to complain that didn't Senate Bill 1084 shut down the ability to
[02:50:43.550 --> 02:50:46.590]  serve a medicated concoction on your premises?
[02:50:47.190 --> 02:50:48.190]  Yup.
[02:50:48.190 --> 02:50:50.150]  Yeah, but they found a way around it, dude, by-
[02:50:50.150 --> 02:50:51.670]  It's not really medicated.
[02:50:51.670 --> 02:50:53.350]  It's just hemp seed juice.
[02:50:53.350 --> 02:50:54.510]  All right.
[02:50:54.510 --> 02:50:59.270]  So Meyer, who owns the 420 Friendly Hotel and is a partner at Keef Cola, also plays
[02:50:59.270 --> 02:51:05.550]  a role in licensing company CanCorp Concepts, extraction equipment manufacturer Isolate
[02:51:05.550 --> 02:51:10.030]  Extraction Systems, hemp company Native Hemp Corp and the American Trade Association for
[02:51:10.030 --> 02:51:11.590]  cannabis and hemp.
[02:51:11.590 --> 02:51:15.790]  Regardless of Meyer's many industrial hats, Native will still feel like a standard high
[02:51:15.790 --> 02:51:17.790]  end boutique hotel, he said.
[02:51:17.790 --> 02:51:19.430]  You know what I didn't hear listed there?
[02:51:19.430 --> 02:51:20.430]  What's up?
[02:51:20.430 --> 02:51:24.150]  A cannabis shop or a cannabis business.
[02:51:24.150 --> 02:51:29.970]  He's one of the many, many entrepreneurs that have sprung up just outside to help support
[02:51:29.970 --> 02:51:32.470]  our wonderful industry.
[02:51:32.470 --> 02:51:33.950]  He had money.
[02:51:33.950 --> 02:51:35.910]  That's what he showed up with.
[02:51:35.910 --> 02:51:37.550]  And a reason to protect that shit.
[02:51:37.550 --> 02:51:40.830]  Uncle Sam won't take your shit for working with us.
[02:51:40.830 --> 02:51:42.630]  It will take it if you are us.
[02:51:42.630 --> 02:51:43.630]  That's the truth.
[02:51:43.630 --> 02:51:44.630]  Wow.
[02:51:44.630 --> 02:51:45.630]  That's a good thing to think about.
[02:51:45.630 --> 02:51:47.590]  They don't want your tax money like that.
[02:51:47.590 --> 02:51:54.630]  I have people in my life that have lobbied me to be him rather than to be me extensively
[02:51:54.630 --> 02:51:55.990]  for that reason.
[02:51:55.990 --> 02:51:56.990]  Yeah.
[02:51:56.990 --> 02:52:00.550]  Pretty soon Mike is going to teach you guys how to become a lobbyist or how to get in
[02:52:00.550 --> 02:52:05.830]  the ground floor of doing medical marijuana activism or recreational cannabis activism
[02:52:05.830 --> 02:52:07.630]  or cannabis legalization activism.
[02:52:07.630 --> 02:52:11.030]  Whatever you're into where you are, Mike is going to do a little lesson on how to get
[02:52:11.030 --> 02:52:12.750]  into that pretty soon for us here.
[02:52:12.750 --> 02:52:15.310]  We're only two or three episodes away from that to tell you the truth.
[02:52:15.310 --> 02:52:16.510]  It's time to get involved people.
[02:52:16.510 --> 02:52:18.230]  I'm going to tell you how it's done.
[02:52:18.230 --> 02:52:19.230]  Yeah.
[02:52:19.230 --> 02:52:20.230]  It's not that much.
[02:52:20.230 --> 02:52:21.870]  You guys seem intimidated, but it's not that bad.
[02:52:21.870 --> 02:52:23.350]  It's really not that bad.
[02:52:23.350 --> 02:52:25.390]  This guy's got this hotel and you can smoke there.
[02:52:25.390 --> 02:52:29.310]  And it goes on to say, we're not going to be hanging green crosses everywhere at admire
[02:52:29.310 --> 02:52:33.430]  who said he funded native with money he made in the financial industry.
[02:52:33.430 --> 02:52:36.830]  We know that there's this big cannabis tourism movement and we want to be able to embrace
[02:52:36.830 --> 02:52:37.830]  it.
[02:52:37.830 --> 02:52:41.390]  We have cannabis friendly, friendly rooms because they have balconies.
[02:52:41.390 --> 02:52:42.390]  16.
[02:52:42.390 --> 02:52:43.390]  I just had a curiosity.
[02:52:43.390 --> 02:52:49.110]  Do you remember the, the, the number of people that came in for the cannabis cup?
[02:52:49.110 --> 02:52:50.750]  A lot more than 16.
[02:52:50.750 --> 02:52:51.750]  Right.
[02:52:51.750 --> 02:52:52.910]  All right.
[02:52:52.910 --> 02:52:57.950]  So when this thing works, we need about 3,500 other people to do the same.
[02:52:57.950 --> 02:52:58.950]  Yes.
[02:52:58.950 --> 02:52:59.950]  Yes.
[02:52:59.950 --> 02:53:00.950]  In Lodo.
[02:53:00.950 --> 02:53:02.950]  No, all over Colorado.
[02:53:02.950 --> 02:53:03.950]  True.
[02:53:03.950 --> 02:53:09.110]  I mean, just for the cannabis cup, like, come on, we need one out in Pueblo West right away.
[02:53:09.110 --> 02:53:11.230]  We need a, we need a cannabis Marriott.
[02:53:12.070 --> 02:53:14.350]  There's a hotel in Manitou Springs that claims to be four 20 friendly.
[02:53:14.350 --> 02:53:19.190]  They have a four 20 friendly on the side, but this is the first one in Denver is the
[02:53:19.190 --> 02:53:20.910]  only reason that's really special.
[02:53:20.910 --> 02:53:24.070]  The one in Manitou, it's not, you can't smoke in the room.
[02:53:24.070 --> 02:53:27.950]  They have a smoking tent and then they have a sub smoking tent.
[02:53:27.950 --> 02:53:31.630]  Like they have the cigarette tent and then right next to it is the cannabis tent with
[02:53:31.630 --> 02:53:33.290]  like chairs and shit in there.
[02:53:33.290 --> 02:53:37.190]  So it is four 20 friendly in there, but you can't smoke out and dab out in the room.
[02:53:37.190 --> 02:53:38.190]  And what's the point?
[02:53:38.190 --> 02:53:40.110]  I want to lay in the bed and watch cartoons.
[02:53:40.110 --> 02:53:41.110]  Right.
[02:53:41.990 --> 02:53:42.990]  I've been to Sweden, plenty of hotel parking lots.
[02:53:42.990 --> 02:53:43.990]  Why is this one special?
[02:53:43.990 --> 02:53:44.990]  All right.
[02:53:44.990 --> 02:53:49.350]  So Meyer said he's been kicked out of hotels in Denver for smoking cannabis inside of his
[02:53:49.350 --> 02:53:50.350]  room.
[02:53:50.350 --> 02:53:52.710]  Other hotels will find you crazy amounts and kick you out.
[02:53:52.710 --> 02:53:55.950]  He said, I've been kicked out at a hotel in Denver for smoking cannabis.
[02:53:55.950 --> 02:54:00.550]  It was a mid tier, smaller hotel, and it was a few years back, but that's the kind of stuff
[02:54:00.550 --> 02:54:03.350]  I don't want to happen in our hotel.
[02:54:03.350 --> 02:54:08.010]  Meyer said he's working on some affinity partnerships with local recreational pot shops and other
[02:54:08.010 --> 02:54:09.010]  related businesses.
[02:54:09.570 --> 02:54:13.410]  Show your native hotel room key and get a discount.
[02:54:13.410 --> 02:54:17.330]  Then it says pro tip recreational shop Lotto Wellness is right across the street.
[02:54:17.330 --> 02:54:18.790]  Yeah, that's cute.
[02:54:18.790 --> 02:54:22.450]  As for stocking his rooms, many bars with branded rolling papers, glass pipes and other
[02:54:22.450 --> 02:54:27.290]  stuff, his team aren't quite there yet.
[02:54:27.290 --> 02:54:28.290]  It's not the word.
[02:54:28.290 --> 02:54:29.290]  Yeah, I'm guessing.
[02:54:29.290 --> 02:54:30.290]  Accoutrements.
[02:54:30.290 --> 02:54:32.930]  I've never seen that word in my life.
[02:54:32.930 --> 02:54:33.930]  That's a new word.
[02:54:33.930 --> 02:54:34.930]  Accoutrements.
[02:54:34.930 --> 02:54:38.410]  It's a good word to learn now.
[02:54:38.410 --> 02:54:41.970]  We want to double and triple check everything, so we're not putting our business at risk.
[02:54:41.970 --> 02:54:46.730]  Meyer said it's a hotel, a club and a restaurant, and we have a lot of alcohol related point
[02:54:46.730 --> 02:54:50.570]  of sales, so we're keeping the cannabis to the rooms.
[02:54:50.570 --> 02:54:51.570]  That's a big thing to think about.
[02:54:51.570 --> 02:54:54.410]  They're going to have to keep the cannabis and the alcohol separate because the alcohol.
[02:54:54.410 --> 02:54:57.610]  They're not allowed to let you gather.
[02:54:57.610 --> 02:55:01.190]  It's a really bizarre part of the law right now.
[02:55:01.190 --> 02:55:06.930]  Most places don't allow any sort of gathering to consume cannabis.
[02:55:06.930 --> 02:55:08.290]  You have to get all kinds of touchy.
[02:55:08.290 --> 02:55:18.130]  It has to be private, invite only, private property close to the public, secured security.
[02:55:18.130 --> 02:55:19.810]  It's just obnoxious.
[02:55:19.810 --> 02:55:23.450]  All the shit the symphony had to go through just so that people could get baked and then
[02:55:23.450 --> 02:55:25.210]  go listen to the symphony.
[02:55:25.210 --> 02:55:27.290]  Then they tried to shut that down.
[02:55:27.290 --> 02:55:29.250]  Tried hard.
[02:55:29.250 --> 02:55:33.530]  They really set the path for the rules for doing this, which is kind of awesome.
[02:55:33.530 --> 02:55:35.130]  Way to go Colorado Symphony.
[02:55:36.130 --> 02:55:39.530]  Who thought they were going to be the trailblazer, but they stepped up.
[02:55:39.530 --> 02:55:40.530]  Right.
[02:55:40.530 --> 02:55:41.530]  That's enough news you guys.
[02:55:41.530 --> 02:55:43.370]  Mike, thanks for coming and doing another news show with me.
[02:55:43.370 --> 02:55:44.370]  Thanks, man.
[02:55:44.370 --> 02:55:45.370]  These are awesome.
[02:55:45.370 --> 02:55:46.370]  Keep them coming.
[02:55:46.370 --> 02:55:50.250]  Start putting together your little episode about how to get these people into cannabis
[02:55:50.250 --> 02:55:51.250]  activism.
[02:55:51.250 --> 02:55:54.010]  I'm sure there are a few people that are out there listening right now that want to be
[02:55:54.010 --> 02:55:56.530]  a cannabis activist and they don't know how to do it.
[02:55:56.530 --> 02:55:57.530]  Start writing that.
[02:55:57.530 --> 02:55:59.130]  Give me 15 or 20 minutes.
[02:55:59.130 --> 02:56:00.130]  We got it, buddy.
[02:56:00.130 --> 02:56:01.130]  Cool.
[02:56:01.130 --> 02:56:02.130]  We'll do that.
[02:56:02.130 --> 02:56:03.130]  You heard him.
[02:56:03.130 --> 02:56:04.130]  He just gave us his word, you guys.
[02:56:04.130 --> 02:56:05.130]  We'll do it.
[02:56:05.130 --> 02:56:06.130]  All right.
[02:56:06.130 --> 02:56:08.130]  Time to start thinking about what you can do for cannabis.
[02:56:08.130 --> 02:56:09.130]  That's right.
[02:56:09.130 --> 02:56:10.130]  This show is going to come out on a Wednesday.
[02:56:10.130 --> 02:56:13.970]  I will be back on Monday with another episode.
[02:56:13.970 --> 02:56:16.810]  Coming up, I don't know that it'll be the next episode, but coming up pretty soon, we
[02:56:16.810 --> 02:56:21.130]  will do an episode about pheno hunting and mother plants, how to take care of your mother
[02:56:21.130 --> 02:56:24.330]  plants, how to select a good mother plant from the pheno hunt.
[02:56:24.330 --> 02:56:27.490]  I think we've done a little bit of it, but I'm going to do a nice focused episode on
[02:56:27.490 --> 02:56:28.490]  that.
[02:56:28.490 --> 02:56:33.730]  Mike's going to do his show about getting us into politics.
[02:56:34.330 --> 02:56:35.330]  Getting involved.
[02:56:35.330 --> 02:56:36.330]  That's what it'll be called.
[02:56:36.330 --> 02:56:39.810]  It's not so much getting you into politics or getting you into lobbying.
[02:56:39.810 --> 02:56:41.610]  It's just you got to get involved.
[02:56:41.610 --> 02:56:46.250]  If you don't get involved now, we're going to be stuck in the same dimerish loop forever.
[02:56:46.250 --> 02:56:49.330]  They're going to make stupid rules around us that we didn't even pay attention to them
[02:56:49.330 --> 02:56:53.010]  making and they're going to pass it because nobody knew.
[02:56:53.010 --> 02:56:56.530]  Your whole country is going to be stuck with fucking CBD only medicine because we weren't
[02:56:56.530 --> 02:56:57.530]  paying attention.
[02:56:57.530 --> 02:56:58.530]  Yep.
[02:56:58.530 --> 02:56:59.530]  Yeah, we don't need that to happen.
[02:56:59.530 --> 02:57:04.930]  One of the big anti-pot groups going around the country right now is now lobbying for
[02:57:04.930 --> 02:57:12.410]  CBD only nationally because if that rule goes in federally, they get their perfect excuse
[02:57:12.410 --> 02:57:17.090]  for stamping out all of the medical access we've created since 96.
[02:57:17.090 --> 02:57:20.930]  They get to say again, well, the feds are allowing it.
[02:57:20.930 --> 02:57:25.490]  Nobody else gets to have it except through A, B, and C, and they get to shut down everything
[02:57:25.490 --> 02:57:27.610]  coast to coast.
[02:57:27.610 --> 02:57:28.770]  It's all the excuse they need.
[02:57:29.010 --> 02:57:32.650]  I did it once already in the 80s.
[02:57:32.650 --> 02:57:33.650]  I fear that.
[02:57:33.650 --> 02:57:34.650]  That sounds terrible.
[02:57:34.650 --> 02:57:37.890]  We'll talk more about that on a future episode when you tell us how to get involved.
[02:57:37.890 --> 02:57:38.890]  We'll talk about that in depth.
[02:57:38.890 --> 02:57:39.890]  It's time to get involved, folks.
[02:57:39.890 --> 02:57:40.890]  All right.
[02:57:40.890 --> 02:57:44.890]  Guys, I'll be back Monday with another full on episode, probably something more in depth,
[02:57:44.890 --> 02:57:47.490]  more less newsy, probably be just myself.
[02:57:47.490 --> 02:57:51.930]  I'm going to try to get King Cola and maybe Jesse back over for some more shows.
[02:57:51.930 --> 02:57:52.930]  Those boys are busy.
[02:57:52.930 --> 02:57:56.170]  It's outdoor season, so Jesse is kicking it with the outdoor grows.
[02:57:56.570 --> 02:57:59.570]  Yeah, they'll be back on the podcast sometime after Christmas, y'all.
[02:57:59.570 --> 02:58:02.370]  We got to get them over here and do some outdoor growing episodes.
[02:58:02.370 --> 02:58:03.970]  Sean agreed to come.
[02:58:03.970 --> 02:58:08.970]  The Rocky Mountain Worm Company is going to maybe jump back on sponsorship.
[02:58:08.970 --> 02:58:12.530]  If not the Rocky Mountain Worm Company, it will be Rocky Mountain Organic Farming, which
[02:58:12.530 --> 02:58:13.730]  is Sean's company.
[02:58:13.730 --> 02:58:17.450]  He will come do a lot of speaking once he becomes an official sponsor of the show.
[02:58:17.450 --> 02:58:18.450]  All right.
[02:58:18.450 --> 02:58:20.890]  Thank you guys for listening again.
[02:58:20.890 --> 02:58:24.010]  If you are interested in sponsoring the podcast or if you have a product you'd like me to
[02:58:24.010 --> 02:58:25.010]  review, send me an email.
[02:58:25.010 --> 02:58:26.010]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[02:58:26.010 --> 02:58:28.410]  I'll get you all the information you need.
[02:58:28.410 --> 02:58:31.970]  Mike and I would have a lot of fun sitting here testing out whatever product you sent
[02:58:31.970 --> 02:58:32.970]  us.
[02:58:32.970 --> 02:58:34.970]  We need some stuff to product test, y'all.
[02:58:34.970 --> 02:58:37.650]  What was that nail we were checking out that a friend of ours had?
[02:58:37.650 --> 02:58:38.890]  What was the name of that?
[02:58:38.890 --> 02:58:39.890]  Was it the Torchless?
[02:58:39.890 --> 02:58:42.570]  I think it was called the Torchless.
[02:58:42.570 --> 02:58:44.570]  I want to review one of those.
[02:58:44.570 --> 02:58:47.850]  Tim, if you're listening to the show, bro, sometimes you listen.
[02:58:47.850 --> 02:58:55.050]  I would like you to send me a Torchless nail to review on the show and we will review it.
[02:58:55.050 --> 02:58:56.050]  Torchless nail.
[02:58:56.050 --> 02:58:58.730]  And then maybe you can become a sponsor or something and that's how we'll pay for the
[02:58:58.730 --> 02:58:59.770]  nail if we like it.
[02:58:59.770 --> 02:59:02.090]  And if we don't like it, we'll send it right back to you.
[02:59:02.090 --> 02:59:03.090]  Yeah.
[02:59:03.090 --> 02:59:06.090]  Who else do we need as a sponsor?
[02:59:06.090 --> 02:59:07.690]  Oh, the Pella Nails.
[02:59:07.690 --> 02:59:10.170]  The guys that make the cases with the email built into the case.
[02:59:10.170 --> 02:59:11.490]  Yeah, we need those.
[02:59:11.490 --> 02:59:12.890]  We want to test out one of those.
[02:59:12.890 --> 02:59:13.890]  Daviddu.
[02:59:13.890 --> 02:59:14.890]  The Daviddu.
[02:59:14.890 --> 02:59:15.890]  I'm not sure what the Daviddu is.
[02:59:15.930 --> 02:59:18.930]  I know an electronic nail company I've been seeing online.
[02:59:18.930 --> 02:59:19.930]  Okay, nice.
[02:59:19.930 --> 02:59:21.570]  Lots of good social media stuff from them.
[02:59:21.570 --> 02:59:22.570]  Yeah.
[02:59:22.570 --> 02:59:23.570]  Or stuff that's got my eye.
[02:59:23.570 --> 02:59:28.490]  The show is reached by over 10,000 people on every episode within the first 24 hours
[02:59:28.490 --> 02:59:29.490]  of being posted.
[02:59:29.490 --> 02:59:33.490]  I'm sure there's some local glass blowers that could use a little prop.
[02:59:33.490 --> 02:59:34.490]  Nice.
[02:59:34.490 --> 02:59:36.410]  All right, you guys, if you want to sponsor the show, let me know.
[02:59:36.410 --> 02:59:41.050]  If you'd like to be advertised on a podcast that reaches 10,000 pot smokers within 24
[02:59:41.050 --> 02:59:42.250]  hours, let me know.
[02:59:42.250 --> 02:59:43.250]  We'll hook you up.
[02:59:43.250 --> 02:59:44.250]  It's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[02:59:45.250 --> 02:59:47.450]  So now that the show is over, guys, make sure you go to iTunes.
[02:59:47.450 --> 02:59:48.450]  Go to the iTunes store.
[02:59:48.450 --> 02:59:50.010]  Search for a girl from your heart.
[02:59:50.010 --> 02:59:51.010]  Find the review section.
[02:59:51.010 --> 02:59:52.930]  Give me a five-star rating, please.
[02:59:52.930 --> 02:59:53.930]  Come on.
[02:59:53.930 --> 02:59:54.930]  Do it.
[02:59:54.930 --> 02:59:55.930]  Yeah, just do it.
[02:59:55.930 --> 02:59:56.930]  Come on.
[02:59:56.930 --> 02:59:57.930]  Do it.
[02:59:57.930 --> 02:59:58.930]  I'm Jedi mind-tricking you right now.
[02:59:58.930 --> 02:59:59.930]  You hear it?
[02:59:59.930 --> 03:00:00.930]  Yeah.
[03:00:00.930 --> 03:00:01.930]  All right, so after you give me five stars, type in a little comment.
[03:00:01.930 --> 03:00:05.530]  Let me know what you think of the show, and I will read your comment on a future episode.
[03:00:05.530 --> 03:00:07.210]  He's going to read it.
[03:00:07.210 --> 03:00:08.210]  I will say I'll read it.
[03:00:08.210 --> 03:00:09.690]  I've read every comment that's on iTunes.
[03:00:09.690 --> 03:00:10.850]  I've read them all.
[03:00:10.850 --> 03:00:13.010]  Stitcher completely sucks for comments.
[03:00:13.010 --> 03:00:14.010]  It's hard to find the comments.
[03:00:14.010 --> 03:00:15.770]  Sometimes it's hard to leave a comment.
[03:00:15.770 --> 03:00:17.670]  They change Stitcher constantly.
[03:00:17.670 --> 03:00:20.130]  If you can leave a comment on there, go for it.
[03:00:20.130 --> 03:00:22.610]  You can always leave some comments on Facebook.
[03:00:22.610 --> 03:00:24.490]  You can leave little comments.
[03:00:24.490 --> 03:00:26.850]  You only get 140 characters, but you can hit me up on Twitter.
[03:00:26.850 --> 03:00:30.250]  If you have something to say, but you're not into the social media thing, definitely email
[03:00:30.250 --> 03:00:31.250]  me.
[03:00:31.250 --> 03:00:32.250]  It's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[03:00:32.250 --> 03:00:37.090]  Don't forget that every show is available on iTunes, Stitcher, and all the episodes
[03:00:37.090 --> 03:00:40.090]  are forever archived on iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[03:00:41.090 --> 03:00:43.370]  I remind you of the donation button.
[03:00:43.370 --> 03:00:47.490]  You go to iRegeneticsColorado.com, click on the Grow From Your Heart podcast tab.
[03:00:47.490 --> 03:00:51.730]  On the top right, there is a donation button that goes directly to my PayPal.
[03:00:51.730 --> 03:00:53.410]  I'm not begging, but I would appreciate it.
[03:00:53.410 --> 03:00:58.130]  This show is always going to be free, but if you want to throw down, I would appreciate
[03:00:58.130 --> 03:00:59.130]  it.
[03:00:59.130 --> 03:01:00.330]  We're on all the social media sites, like I said.
[03:01:00.330 --> 03:01:02.410]  Hey, Mike, how can these guys find you on social media?
[03:01:02.410 --> 03:01:06.810]  It's at Nemopunk15, N-E-M-O-P-U-N-K-1-5.
[03:01:06.810 --> 03:01:07.810]  There you go, guys.
[03:01:07.810 --> 03:01:08.810]  Find him, follow him.
[03:01:08.810 --> 03:01:09.810]  He's a huge cannabis supporter.
[03:01:10.530 --> 03:01:11.530]  He contributes to the show quite a bit.
[03:01:11.530 --> 03:01:12.530]  Thanks for that.
[03:01:12.530 --> 03:01:15.770]  Let me know what type of news you want me to send Jeff's way, and we'll talk about
[03:01:15.770 --> 03:01:16.770]  it on the show.
[03:01:16.770 --> 03:01:17.770]  Or send some news to Mike.
[03:01:17.770 --> 03:01:18.770]  Mike will proofread it.
[03:01:18.770 --> 03:01:19.770]  Lots of questions.
[03:01:19.770 --> 03:01:21.770]  And if it qualifies for the show, he will forward it right my way.
[03:01:21.770 --> 03:01:22.770]  Send us questions.
[03:01:22.770 --> 03:01:26.210]  Or you guys can just send it right to me at GFYHpodcast on Twitter.
[03:01:26.210 --> 03:01:29.090]  So yeah, make sure you guys follow iRegenetics on Instagram.
[03:01:29.090 --> 03:01:31.770]  I post a lot of great cannabis photography.
[03:01:31.770 --> 03:01:35.610]  I am starting to be at the spot a lot more frequently.
[03:01:35.610 --> 03:01:39.770]  Well, car's busted, but by now, by the time this comes out, I'll be driving the car again.
[03:01:40.730 --> 03:01:41.730]  I'm at the spot quite often.
[03:01:41.730 --> 03:01:42.730]  We're getting ready to rock.
[03:01:42.730 --> 03:01:46.050]  I will be posting more pictures of the spot dispensary as time goes on.
[03:01:46.050 --> 03:01:48.290]  So make sure you follow me on Instagram.
[03:01:48.290 --> 03:01:49.290]  It's at iRegenetics.
[03:01:49.290 --> 03:01:51.290]  We're going to wrap up the show.
[03:01:51.290 --> 03:01:52.290]  Mike, thanks for coming again, bro.
[03:01:52.290 --> 03:01:53.290]  Happy to, man.
[03:01:53.290 --> 03:01:54.290]  Thank you guys for listening.
[03:01:54.290 --> 03:01:55.290]  Until next time.
[03:01:55.290 --> 03:01:56.290]  Oh, did I do that?
[03:01:56.290 --> 03:01:58.090]  Did I say shout out to my ninja Spence?
[03:01:58.090 --> 03:01:59.090]  We almost fucked that up.
[03:01:59.090 --> 03:02:00.090]  I wasn't going to fuck it up.
[03:02:00.090 --> 03:02:01.090]  Oh, man.
[03:02:01.090 --> 03:02:02.090]  Shout out to my ninja Spence.
[03:02:02.090 --> 03:02:03.090]  What up, brother?
[03:02:03.090 --> 03:02:04.090]  Thanks again for listening, you guys.
[03:02:04.090 --> 03:02:09.090]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[03:02:10.090 --> 03:03:59.220]  All right, podcast world.

[03:04:05.580 --> 03:04:06.580]  episodes.
