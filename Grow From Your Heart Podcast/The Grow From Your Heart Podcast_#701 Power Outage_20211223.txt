[00:16.250 --> 00:17.250]  All right, here we go.
[00:17.250 --> 00:18.890]  Welcome back, Podcast World.
[00:18.890 --> 00:19.890]  I'm your host.
[00:19.890 --> 00:20.890]  My friends call me Ross DeGeff.
[00:20.890 --> 00:25.890]  This is episode 701 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:25.890 --> 00:30.490]  In this episode, I'm going to talk a little bit about having a power outage in your grow
[00:30.490 --> 00:31.490]  space.
[00:31.490 --> 00:35.250]  Before I get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of those kind
[00:35.250 --> 00:39.810]  folks who continue to support the show on Patreon.

[01:00.430 --> 01:02.950]  favorite testers, Root 305.
[01:02.950 --> 01:06.650]  Let's send a thank you shout out to another great tester, my buddy Mobius Grows.

[01:14.090 --> 01:15.690]  to my buddy Stoner Dave.
[01:15.690 --> 01:16.730]  Then let's wrap it all up
[01:16.730 --> 01:19.690]  with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out
[01:19.690 --> 01:22.130]  to ADHD Grower.

[02:16.590 --> 02:17.950]  It was an amazing year.
[02:17.950 --> 02:20.190]  Obviously could not have done it without you.
[02:20.190 --> 02:21.010]  So thank you.
[02:21.010 --> 02:22.570]  All right, let's not ramble too much.
[02:22.570 --> 02:24.470]  Let's get into this podcast.
[02:24.470 --> 02:26.990]  I try not to talk too much about myself,
[02:26.990 --> 02:28.230]  my life in this show,
[02:28.230 --> 02:29.790]  because some people do find it boring.
[02:29.790 --> 02:31.750]  I'm going to get comments that the first five minutes
[02:31.750 --> 02:33.590]  of this show was nothing but rambles.
[02:33.590 --> 02:35.710]  But a lot of my friends do enjoy hearing
[02:35.710 --> 02:37.150]  about what's going on in my life
[02:37.150 --> 02:39.070]  and enjoying what I've experienced
[02:39.410 --> 02:40.250]  and I like to be sharing that with them.
[02:40.250 --> 02:41.210]  I like to bring my friends in.
[02:41.210 --> 02:44.570]  So come along, it's story time with Ross DeJeff.
[02:44.570 --> 02:47.250]  I recently got to experience an amazing place
[02:47.250 --> 02:48.690]  called Meow Wolf.
[02:48.690 --> 02:50.890]  There are three Meow Wolf locations.
[02:50.890 --> 02:53.050]  There's a New Mexico location,
[02:53.050 --> 02:56.090]  a Las Vegas location, and a Denver location.
[02:56.090 --> 02:58.370]  I went to the Denver location.
[02:58.370 --> 03:00.170]  Meow Wolf is an amazing place.
[03:00.170 --> 03:02.690]  It is called the Meow Wolf Convergence
[03:02.690 --> 03:04.150]  is what it is known as at that place.
[03:04.150 --> 03:06.330]  Convergence Station might be the real name.
[03:06.350 --> 03:10.670]  I can't really describe what happens inside of Meow Wolf.
[03:10.670 --> 03:12.190]  Meow, like what a cat says,
[03:12.190 --> 03:13.550]  and wolf like the animal.
[03:13.550 --> 03:18.390]  Meow Wolf, it is an interactive art experience.
[03:18.390 --> 03:22.650]  Basically, it is like walking into a mushroom trip
[03:22.650 --> 03:25.110]  inside of a building is the easiest,
[03:25.110 --> 03:26.410]  best way to describe it.
[03:26.410 --> 03:29.110]  Meow Wolf is an amazing experience.
[03:29.110 --> 03:30.990]  I was there for two hours.
[03:30.990 --> 03:33.910]  I got there at 10 o'clock, they closed at midnight.
[03:33.910 --> 03:35.030]  They politely kick you out.
[03:35.050 --> 03:36.650]  That's not like a get the fuck out situation,
[03:36.650 --> 03:38.570]  but they're like, hey, convergence is closed,
[03:38.570 --> 03:39.950]  you gotta go.
[03:39.950 --> 03:42.350]  In that two hours, I missed a lot.
[03:42.350 --> 03:43.930]  The only way I know I missed a lot
[03:43.930 --> 03:46.090]  is because I've seen other social media posts
[03:46.090 --> 03:48.770]  and other videos, and I didn't see a lot of the shit
[03:48.770 --> 03:51.370]  in those videos and a lot of the things in those posts.
[03:51.370 --> 03:53.030]  So I know there's a lot more of that place
[03:53.030 --> 03:56.110]  to explore, discover, interact with.
[03:56.110 --> 03:58.930]  The next time I go, I will buy the little Q card.
[03:58.930 --> 04:01.050]  It's an amazing experience without the Q card,
[04:01.050 --> 04:03.430]  but if you buy this little thing called the Q card,
[04:03.450 --> 04:05.050]  there are places where you can tap the card
[04:05.050 --> 04:06.810]  and more things.
[04:06.810 --> 04:08.130]  The place comes to life, honestly.
[04:08.130 --> 04:09.670]  The whole place is interactive.
[04:09.670 --> 04:11.730]  Everything you walk by, touch,
[04:11.730 --> 04:13.490]  has some sort of user interaction.
[04:13.490 --> 04:17.290]  So you walk into one area and there are doorways,
[04:17.290 --> 04:18.410]  and there are hidden doorways.
[04:18.410 --> 04:20.290]  Sometimes it just looks like the wall.
[04:20.290 --> 04:21.890]  I would push on certain parts of the wall
[04:21.890 --> 04:23.730]  and it would open up and there would be
[04:23.730 --> 04:24.770]  a mirror maze in there.
[04:24.770 --> 04:25.930]  When you come out of the mirror maze,
[04:25.930 --> 04:27.650]  now you're in some weird pizza land,
[04:27.650 --> 04:29.170]  and then you come out of pizza land
[04:29.170 --> 04:30.450]  and now you're in the catacombs,
[04:30.450 --> 04:31.690]  and then you come out of the catacombs
[04:31.710 --> 04:33.710]  and you're in some weird fairy land.
[04:33.710 --> 04:38.070]  It was, I can't do it justice by explaining it with words,
[04:38.070 --> 04:39.750]  but I had such a good time, I had to share it.
[04:39.750 --> 04:41.430]  I had to talk about it.
[04:41.430 --> 04:45.170]  It is a fully immersive, interactive,
[04:45.170 --> 04:47.670]  psychedelic art experience,
[04:47.670 --> 04:49.110]  and you can spend hours in there.
[04:49.110 --> 04:50.970]  So have fun when you go.
[04:50.970 --> 04:52.110]  I do highly recommend it.
[04:52.110 --> 04:53.410]  The Denver place is amazing.
[04:53.410 --> 04:56.630]  I've heard that the Albuquerque place is just as good.
[04:56.630 --> 04:58.270]  The reviews I have read and things I have heard,
[04:58.270 --> 05:00.830]  the Las Vegas location is not as impressive,
[05:00.850 --> 05:02.730]  but still amazing.
[05:02.730 --> 05:04.090]  But I wanted to share with you guys
[05:04.090 --> 05:05.850]  the fun experience that I had at MeowWolf.
[05:05.850 --> 05:07.630]  I will quit rambling about that.
[05:07.630 --> 05:09.790]  If you are a cannabis consumer,
[05:09.790 --> 05:10.930]  if you've got a brain like me,
[05:10.930 --> 05:14.730]  if you're into art, creativity, experiences,
[05:14.730 --> 05:16.530]  anybody of all ages can go there.
[05:16.530 --> 05:18.490]  It's available for all ages.
[05:18.490 --> 05:20.890]  You may wanna carry the small kids.
[05:20.890 --> 05:22.570]  Go during the day if you got little ones,
[05:22.570 --> 05:25.650]  because at night people may or may not be
[05:25.650 --> 05:27.490]  not in their totally right mind,
[05:27.490 --> 05:29.850]  unless you want your kids around some people
[05:29.870 --> 05:31.390]  that are gooned out a little bit.
[05:31.390 --> 05:32.590]  You might wanna go a little earlier.
[05:32.590 --> 05:35.450]  They do also offer days, nights,
[05:35.450 --> 05:38.190]  which are adults only after 6 p.m.
[05:38.190 --> 05:41.470]  You do have to be 21 to get in on some dates.
[05:41.470 --> 05:43.570]  They do announce that on their calendar.
[05:43.570 --> 05:45.150]  You do have to buy tickets in advance.
[05:45.150 --> 05:47.830]  I feel like I just did a fucking MeowWolf commercial.
[05:47.830 --> 05:48.990]  Not what that was supposed to be.
[05:48.990 --> 05:50.910]  I did not get paid for that.
[05:50.910 --> 05:52.050]  I simply enjoyed it so much.
[05:52.050 --> 05:53.790]  I wanted to share the experience with you.
[05:53.790 --> 05:55.110]  It was a great place.
[05:55.110 --> 05:56.390]  It was a good time.
[05:56.390 --> 05:58.870]  I was led by someone who's already been there,
[05:58.870 --> 06:00.310]  and they knew right where to take me,
[06:00.310 --> 06:01.410]  right what to show me,
[06:01.410 --> 06:02.930]  like they'd already been in my brain.
[06:02.930 --> 06:04.370]  There's one room in MeowWolf.
[06:04.370 --> 06:06.290]  It looks like you've dumped my brain on the floor.
[06:06.290 --> 06:07.290]  It's pretty amazing.
[06:07.290 --> 06:09.450]  Anyway, that's enough of a MeowWolf commercial.
[06:09.450 --> 06:10.290]  You guys go there.
[06:10.290 --> 06:11.630]  Check it out.
[06:11.630 --> 06:12.730]  Have a good time.
[06:12.730 --> 06:14.730]  I can't tell you to alter yourself,
[06:14.730 --> 06:16.290]  but if you alter yourself,
[06:16.290 --> 06:19.210]  it will be the most amazing experience you could imagine.
[06:19.210 --> 06:21.970]  If you're somebody that doesn't alter yourself,
[06:21.970 --> 06:24.810]  that place is kinda what it feels like to be altered.
[06:24.810 --> 06:27.170]  You're walking around in somebody's mushroom trip
[06:27.170 --> 06:28.490]  when you were inside of there.
[06:28.990 --> 06:30.070]  All right, let's move on from MeowWolf.
[06:30.070 --> 06:32.070]  I feel like I gave them a big commercial.
[06:32.070 --> 06:33.710]  MeowWolf, I'll look forward to the free tickets
[06:33.710 --> 06:34.910]  in my inbox.
[06:34.910 --> 06:36.310]  Let's see.
[06:36.310 --> 06:38.110]  The 710 episode is coming up.
[06:38.110 --> 06:38.950]  What?
[06:38.950 --> 06:40.750]  Not 710 the month, not 710 the holiday.
[06:40.750 --> 06:42.310]  Episode number 710.
[06:42.310 --> 06:44.350]  That's right, this is number 701.
[06:44.350 --> 06:46.390]  710 is nine episodes away.
[06:46.390 --> 06:49.670]  710 is the concentration celebration.
[06:49.670 --> 06:51.310]  710 is the new 420.
[06:51.310 --> 06:53.510]  We will explain why on the episode,
[06:53.510 --> 06:55.670]  but 710 is the new time to smoke.
[06:55.670 --> 06:58.070]  That's when you take dabs, when you smoke oil.
[06:58.090 --> 07:00.730]  Maybe that will give you a hint of why we say 710.
[07:00.730 --> 07:03.370]  However, the 710 episode is coming up.
[07:03.370 --> 07:07.410]  I would like questions from the audience and the listeners.
[07:07.410 --> 07:10.890]  If you have got dab questions, concentrate questions,
[07:10.890 --> 07:13.650]  710 questions, I would love to get those questions
[07:13.650 --> 07:17.230]  because I do plan to have a very well-known,
[07:17.230 --> 07:20.650]  very reputable concentrate maker here on the podcast.
[07:20.650 --> 07:23.050]  Somebody that grows their own flowers
[07:23.050 --> 07:26.070]  and presses, makes rosin out of those flowers
[07:26.070 --> 07:27.990]  and is very well-known for their impressive,
[07:27.990 --> 07:29.210]  delicious rosin.
[07:29.210 --> 07:31.090]  I'm not a fan of a lot of rosin.
[07:31.090 --> 07:32.970]  I'll smoke Green Dot and I'll smoke rosin
[07:32.970 --> 07:35.490]  from this other person and a couple of other people,
[07:35.490 --> 07:38.810]  but I'm going to have a great concentrate maker,
[07:38.810 --> 07:42.130]  rosin presser, grower, member of the community
[07:42.130 --> 07:43.810]  here on the show.
[07:43.810 --> 07:46.010]  I should be able to answer a lot of the concentrate
[07:46.010 --> 07:47.770]  questions and what I cannot answer,
[07:47.770 --> 07:49.990]  our friends that I do plan to have on the show
[07:49.990 --> 07:51.530]  will answer those for us.
[07:51.530 --> 07:54.110]  So I do invite you to send me questions.
[07:54.110 --> 07:56.530]  Please, the email address is growfromyourheart
[07:56.530 --> 07:57.850]  at hotmail.com.
[07:57.850 --> 08:00.290]  I look forward to all of your concentrate questions.
[08:00.290 --> 08:04.230]  If it's about dabbing, dab equipment, concentrates,
[08:04.230 --> 08:08.030]  we won't talk about making BHO concentrates.
[08:08.030 --> 08:10.010]  We won't talk about making things like that.
[08:10.010 --> 08:13.770]  What we're going to focus on is how every home grower
[08:13.770 --> 08:17.290]  can safely and legally produce their own concentrates
[08:17.290 --> 08:18.130]  at home.
[08:18.130 --> 08:19.410]  That's what we're going to focus on.
[08:19.410 --> 08:22.610]  But anyway, I'm rambling and stoned, obviously, today.
[08:22.630 --> 08:24.350]  Big shout out to my friend who got me
[08:24.350 --> 08:26.750]  the cake batter dabs.
[08:26.750 --> 08:28.150]  That shit is working, bro.
[08:28.150 --> 08:29.950]  You know who you are.
[08:29.950 --> 08:30.870]  Where are we going from there?
[08:30.870 --> 08:32.250]  Questions for the 710 show.
[08:32.250 --> 08:34.430]  Concentrate questions, hash questions,
[08:34.430 --> 08:37.110]  concentrate questions, dabbing questions.
[08:37.110 --> 08:37.950]  Send them my way.
[08:37.950 --> 08:40.090]  Growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[08:40.090 --> 08:43.110]  I'll do my best to get them on episode number 710.
[08:43.110 --> 08:46.070]  Maybe if I don't use those questions for episode 710,
[08:46.070 --> 08:48.450]  I'll just use them for an episode after that.
[08:48.450 --> 08:50.490]  If I can answer them on my own, I'll handle them,
[08:50.490 --> 08:52.110]  field them myself in another episode.
[08:52.610 --> 08:55.190]  Load me up, hash questions, concentrate questions.
[08:55.190 --> 08:56.230]  I can't wait.
[08:56.230 --> 08:58.190]  All right, where do we go from there?
[08:58.190 --> 08:59.150]  This show.
[08:59.150 --> 09:00.110]  Let me check the calendar.
[09:00.110 --> 09:02.070]  I do believe that this will be the podcast
[09:02.070 --> 09:04.870]  that comes out right before, yes,
[09:04.870 --> 09:06.850]  this will come out right before Christmas,
[09:06.850 --> 09:08.630]  just the day before Christmas Eve.
[09:08.630 --> 09:09.870]  So I want to make sure to wish everybody
[09:09.870 --> 09:12.110]  whatever holiday it is that you celebrate.
[09:12.110 --> 09:13.110]  I'm not picky.
[09:13.110 --> 09:13.950]  I love you.
[09:13.950 --> 09:16.030]  Whatever holiday you are going to celebrate this winter,
[09:16.030 --> 09:18.650]  your cold season holiday, your winter holiday,
[09:18.650 --> 09:21.070]  your excuse to take some time off work, off of school,
[09:21.070 --> 09:23.150]  and spend time with your family, enjoy that.
[09:23.150 --> 09:26.510]  I hope you have the best winter holiday season
[09:26.510 --> 09:27.750]  that you can have.
[09:27.750 --> 09:28.770]  Slow down for a minute.
[09:28.770 --> 09:30.190]  Unplug for a minute.
[09:30.190 --> 09:31.110]  Turn off TikTok.
[09:31.110 --> 09:34.310]  Spend some time with some people that you care about.
[09:34.310 --> 09:36.190]  It doesn't have to be your blood family.
[09:36.190 --> 09:37.710]  It could be your cannabis family.
[09:37.710 --> 09:39.270]  It could be your sneakerhead family.
[09:39.270 --> 09:41.070]  It could be your skateboard family.
[09:41.070 --> 09:42.510]  It could be your band family.
[09:42.510 --> 09:43.850]  It could be your gang family.
[09:43.850 --> 09:46.370]  If that's what you finna do, be with your family.
[09:46.370 --> 09:47.430]  Spend some time.
[09:47.430 --> 09:48.350]  Unplug for a minute.
[09:48.350 --> 09:50.370]  Spend some peaceful, loving, caring time together.
[09:50.370 --> 09:51.570]  Recharge yourselves.
[09:51.570 --> 09:54.130]  I know we get moving fast, especially me.
[09:54.130 --> 09:58.810]  I work eight days a week, 26 hours a day, 42 days a month.
[09:58.810 --> 10:00.210]  I know what it's like to go fast,
[10:00.210 --> 10:01.330]  try to get a lot of shit done,
[10:01.330 --> 10:04.170]  but it's the time of year to take a break, hug somebody,
[10:04.170 --> 10:06.790]  eat some good food, exchange some gifts.
[10:06.790 --> 10:08.790]  Even if those gifts are just your company,
[10:08.790 --> 10:10.450]  be around each other, chill out.
[10:10.450 --> 10:12.730]  Anyway, my point of this was,
[10:12.730 --> 10:15.250]  I don't care what holiday you celebrate, I still love you.
[10:15.250 --> 10:16.290]  Happy holiday.
[10:16.290 --> 10:21.090]  Big respect, every color, race, creed, orientation.
[10:21.090 --> 10:22.650]  It's time for that love right now.
[10:22.650 --> 10:24.970]  So spread the love, happy holidays.
[10:24.970 --> 10:26.730]  Now let's jump into the actual part of the podcast.
[10:26.730 --> 10:28.130]  I'm fucking rambling here at the start of the show.
[10:28.130 --> 10:29.770]  It's gonna be a nine hour show.
[10:29.770 --> 10:33.370]  I haven't even talked about any of the main topics.
[10:33.370 --> 10:34.270]  The new year is coming up.
[10:34.270 --> 10:35.550]  There's probably another episode.
[10:35.550 --> 10:37.010]  Yeah, there's more episodes before the new year,
[10:37.010 --> 10:38.850]  but it is time to start thinking about
[10:38.850 --> 10:41.430]  what are we going to do with ourselves in the new year?
[10:41.430 --> 10:43.410]  It's always time to have a fresh start.
[10:43.410 --> 10:44.850]  You're changing that calendar.
[10:44.850 --> 10:47.050]  Are you going to get your goal of how many,
[10:47.050 --> 10:48.890]  how many harvests are you going to get next year?
[10:48.890 --> 10:50.490]  Have you figured out how to set a rhythm
[10:50.490 --> 10:52.770]  of how many harvests you expect in your grow?
[10:52.770 --> 10:54.210]  Now's a good time to set goals,
[10:54.210 --> 10:56.890]  not just in your grow, but in your life.
[10:56.890 --> 10:58.130]  You got about two weeks now
[10:58.130 --> 10:59.970]  to clean all this shit up in your life,
[10:59.970 --> 11:01.710]  about a week and a half, clean up all the bullshit,
[11:01.710 --> 11:03.890]  get it straightened up so we can start next year
[11:03.890 --> 11:04.750]  fucking strong.
[11:04.750 --> 11:07.490]  So set some goals in your grow.
[11:07.490 --> 11:08.890]  Set some goals in your grow.
[11:08.890 --> 11:10.690]  What are you gonna be better at next year?
[11:10.690 --> 11:12.170]  Are you going to learn how to clone better?
[11:12.170 --> 11:14.650]  Are you gonna get better at defoliating?
[11:15.490 --> 11:16.530]  Are you gonna learn how to finally take clones?
[11:16.530 --> 11:18.530]  I said clones already, but you know what I'm saying.
[11:18.530 --> 11:21.170]  What are you going to improve on next year?
[11:21.170 --> 11:23.450]  Then in your life, what are you going to improve on?
[11:23.450 --> 11:25.130]  One of the things I keep saying
[11:25.130 --> 11:27.370]  is that I'm going to be better at answering emails.
[11:27.370 --> 11:29.850]  I try my best to respond and interact
[11:29.850 --> 11:31.910]  with all the emails that I get, but I'm overloaded.
[11:31.910 --> 11:34.290]  So one of my new year's resolutions again
[11:34.290 --> 11:38.250]  is to answer all the damn emails as quickly as possible.
[11:38.250 --> 11:40.350]  If you email me, and I keep looking at my phone right now
[11:40.350 --> 11:41.190]  as I'm talking about,
[11:41.190 --> 11:43.530]  I'm giving myself a panic attack and anxiety.
[11:43.530 --> 11:44.490]  But I get a lot of emails.
[11:45.330 --> 11:47.250]  If you email me and I don't reply, it's not personal.
[11:47.250 --> 11:48.450]  I can't keep up.
[11:48.450 --> 11:50.290]  And then you reply and people reply.
[11:50.290 --> 11:52.170]  So I'll reply to 100 emails in a day
[11:52.170 --> 11:53.530]  and I get 100 responses.
[11:53.530 --> 11:56.010]  I'm not bitching, but it's hard.
[11:56.010 --> 11:58.410]  So one of my resolutions is to do better at emails.
[11:58.410 --> 12:00.650]  So if you've been emailing me, maybe in the new year,
[12:00.650 --> 12:02.730]  I'll finally get back to you and I do apologize.
[12:02.730 --> 12:04.090]  So you have some goals for the new year
[12:04.090 --> 12:06.410]  in the grow and in your life.
[12:06.410 --> 12:07.890]  It doesn't have to be something big.
[12:07.890 --> 12:09.990]  If you do something that you don't like that you do,
[12:09.990 --> 12:11.850]  if you know you do something that sucks,
[12:11.850 --> 12:13.650]  do it one time less next year.
[12:13.730 --> 12:17.730]  Over 365 days, if you do the shitty thing one time less,
[12:17.730 --> 12:19.250]  that is progress.
[12:19.250 --> 12:21.850]  If you do something that you wish you did more,
[12:21.850 --> 12:23.530]  everybody says they're gonna go to the gym, right?
[12:23.530 --> 12:25.170]  If you say, I wanna go to the gym,
[12:25.170 --> 12:27.150]  if you make it one day a week,
[12:27.150 --> 12:28.810]  that's more than you were doing last year,
[12:28.810 --> 12:29.730]  that's an improvement.
[12:29.730 --> 12:31.410]  Maybe you worked that up to two or three times,
[12:31.410 --> 12:32.850]  but build onto things.
[12:32.850 --> 12:34.810]  I'm not a gym person, that's my example.
[12:34.810 --> 12:37.110]  Just saying, build on things, improve this year.
[12:37.110 --> 12:39.530]  Let's set some goals, let's move forward.
[12:39.530 --> 12:42.450]  So my next question is, what did you learn this year?
[12:42.450 --> 12:43.970]  Did you learn some stuff this year?
[12:43.970 --> 12:45.810]  Sit back for a minute, think about what you learned.
[12:45.810 --> 12:49.490]  We have been through a lot of shit for the past year,
[12:49.490 --> 12:52.110]  year and a half, coming up on two years-ish, right?
[12:52.110 --> 12:55.150]  Our minds, our bodies, our psychological systems
[12:55.150 --> 12:56.410]  have been put through hell.
[12:56.410 --> 12:58.890]  A lot of us, our health has been put through hell.
[12:58.890 --> 12:59.810]  What did you learn?
[12:59.810 --> 13:00.710]  How did you come out of it?
[13:00.710 --> 13:03.290]  You probably had a lot of emotional, spiritual,
[13:03.290 --> 13:05.650]  physical, psychological learning this year.
[13:05.650 --> 13:06.570]  What did you learn?
[13:06.570 --> 13:08.610]  How did you deal with it?
[13:08.610 --> 13:11.730]  I learned how to deal with a lot of emotional things.
[13:12.250 --> 13:13.730]  Maybe not emotional, but I was used to going
[13:13.730 --> 13:16.210]  to comedy shows and concerts every single weekend.
[13:16.210 --> 13:19.130]  And for 18 months, I was stuck here in this house.
[13:19.130 --> 13:20.010]  What did I do with that?
[13:20.010 --> 13:20.850]  What did I learn?
[13:20.850 --> 13:21.890]  How do I improve?
[13:21.890 --> 13:26.890]  I turned my audio podcast into a 4K multicam podcast
[13:26.890 --> 13:27.930]  that comes out twice a week,
[13:27.930 --> 13:29.570]  and I feel like it's pretty well produced,
[13:29.570 --> 13:30.930]  and I put out a good show.
[13:30.930 --> 13:33.570]  That's what I tried to learn and do with my year,
[13:33.570 --> 13:38.010]  my pandy time, if you will, my forced stay-at-home vacation.
[13:38.010 --> 13:39.410]  So what did you learn?
[13:39.410 --> 13:41.710]  What are you gonna learn next year?
[13:42.690 --> 13:43.510]  I already said, get better at something.
[13:43.510 --> 13:44.750]  So what are we gonna learn next year?
[13:44.750 --> 13:46.670]  Think about what you learned this year.
[13:46.670 --> 13:48.590]  Think about what you can do with the next year.
[13:48.590 --> 13:50.070]  I'm not trying to get too philosophical,
[13:50.070 --> 13:52.470]  but a lot of people forget that sometimes
[13:52.470 --> 13:55.050]  you gotta sit down, reflect, what did you learn?
[13:55.050 --> 13:56.470]  What am I gonna do next year?
[13:56.470 --> 13:58.190]  Now's a good time to check in with yourself,
[13:58.190 --> 14:00.390]  check in with your business, check in with your life,
[14:00.390 --> 14:02.550]  your grow, just get a good grip on some shit.
[14:02.550 --> 14:04.630]  Maybe you got some loose ends you haven't thought about.
[14:04.630 --> 14:06.370]  Might be time to clean that shit up,
[14:06.370 --> 14:07.710]  start a new year fresh.
[14:07.710 --> 14:08.710]  Let's go strong.
[14:08.710 --> 14:10.570]  Set yourself up for success is something
[14:10.570 --> 14:11.970]  that I say a lot.
[14:11.970 --> 14:14.410]  I don't know if I've ever given credit on the show
[14:14.410 --> 14:17.930]  to who taught me the phrase set yourself up for success.
[14:17.930 --> 14:21.130]  I believe it was seventh grade at Bellflower High School
[14:21.130 --> 14:24.170]  in Bellflower, California, and it was Miss Dodson
[14:24.170 --> 14:26.990]  is who taught a class called success.
[14:26.990 --> 14:29.790]  And I was, set yourself up for success
[14:29.790 --> 14:32.450]  was one of the phrases that she said a lot.
[14:32.450 --> 14:34.570]  And you might not believe me, I'm sure you'll believe me.
[14:34.570 --> 14:36.250]  I gave a speech in her class.
[14:36.250 --> 14:37.330]  I'm just rambling at this point,
[14:37.330 --> 14:40.170]  but it's a Christmas show, Merry motherfucking Christmas.
[14:40.690 --> 14:42.850]  I gave a speech in her class, we had to give speeches.
[14:42.850 --> 14:45.610]  And everybody at the time did, like Michael Jordan,
[14:45.610 --> 14:48.130]  and I think it was Mark McGuire and Jose Canseco
[14:48.130 --> 14:49.570]  were popular at that time.
[14:49.570 --> 14:52.050]  Everybody did those people as their heroes.
[14:52.050 --> 14:53.690]  We had to do a speech on our heroes.
[14:53.690 --> 14:55.610]  I don't remember who the girls did, sorry ladies.
[14:55.610 --> 14:57.090]  I don't remember who the girls chose
[14:57.090 --> 14:58.490]  to do their speeches about.
[14:58.490 --> 15:00.490]  But all the boys chose Michael Jordan.
[15:01.630 --> 15:04.090]  One guy did Wayne Gretzky, and I remember Jose Canseco
[15:04.090 --> 15:07.130]  and Mark McGuire, it was the home run derby time
[15:07.130 --> 15:09.130]  is when this speech had to happen.
[15:09.170 --> 15:11.490]  But I did my speech in seventh grade,
[15:11.490 --> 15:13.770]  and Miss Dodson looked at me at the end of my speech
[15:13.770 --> 15:17.490]  and said, I've never given anybody an A on a speech before.
[15:17.490 --> 15:20.050]  And I was like, oh, I just got the first A on a speech.
[15:20.050 --> 15:20.870]  So that was kind of cool.
[15:20.870 --> 15:22.250]  She set me up for success, bro.
[15:22.250 --> 15:24.490]  Now this far into life, I'm successful
[15:24.490 --> 15:26.130]  because that lady made me give a good speech
[15:26.130 --> 15:27.390]  and gave me confidence in myself.
[15:27.390 --> 15:30.970]  So I'll always remember, set yourself up for success.
[15:30.970 --> 15:32.450]  Do that for yourself, anything.
[15:32.450 --> 15:35.810]  You could do that in the grow, in your life.
[15:35.810 --> 15:37.250]  You can do it everywhere.
[15:37.250 --> 15:39.250]  If you're a stoner, have your keys and your wallet
[15:39.250 --> 15:40.210]  and your phone ready to go.
[15:40.210 --> 15:41.790]  If you got to remember to take something tomorrow,
[15:41.790 --> 15:44.490]  set it by your phone or by your shoes or by your keys.
[15:44.490 --> 15:46.010]  Set yourself up for success.
[15:46.010 --> 15:48.050]  Small shit will lead to big shit.
[15:48.050 --> 15:50.850]  All right, I am rambling, getting all philosophical.
[15:50.850 --> 15:52.410]  Nobody came here for all that stuff.
[15:52.410 --> 15:56.250]  You guys came here for a cannabis growing podcast.
[15:56.250 --> 15:58.610]  Let's talk a little bit about growing cannabis.
[15:58.610 --> 16:02.370]  Recently, a lot of people have experienced power outages.
[16:02.370 --> 16:05.030]  All over social media, I see my power is out.
[16:05.030 --> 16:05.870]  What do I do?
[16:05.870 --> 16:06.690]  The power has been out.
[16:07.130 --> 16:07.970]  The power went out.
[16:07.970 --> 16:08.790]  The power is going to go out.
[16:08.790 --> 16:09.850]  The power is flickering.
[16:09.850 --> 16:12.090]  How do we deal with power outages?
[16:12.090 --> 16:14.230]  I live in a decent area.
[16:14.230 --> 16:15.650]  We've got a lot of infrastructure here.
[16:15.650 --> 16:16.490]  I'm in the city.
[16:16.490 --> 16:17.310]  I'm not in the sticks.
[16:17.310 --> 16:18.650]  I'm not in the woods.
[16:18.650 --> 16:19.730]  If the power goes out here,
[16:19.730 --> 16:21.370]  they're usually pretty quick on it.
[16:21.370 --> 16:23.650]  Even in my neighborhood in the past couple of weeks
[16:23.650 --> 16:25.390]  because of the extreme wind,
[16:25.390 --> 16:28.010]  we experienced 90 mile an hour winds here.
[16:28.010 --> 16:30.210]  The power did go out several times.
[16:30.210 --> 16:32.170]  So people are asking me, emailing me
[16:32.170 --> 16:33.790]  and posting it on social media.
[16:33.790 --> 16:36.750]  How do we deal with these power outages this year?
[16:36.750 --> 16:38.450]  Now we do have a few things to think about.
[16:38.450 --> 16:41.630]  A lot of us may have multiple cycles of plants
[16:41.630 --> 16:42.590]  in our grow space.
[16:42.590 --> 16:43.870]  You may have flowering plants.
[16:43.870 --> 16:45.350]  You may have veg plants.
[16:45.350 --> 16:46.390]  You may have clones.
[16:46.390 --> 16:48.070]  The clones and the easy cloner
[16:48.070 --> 16:49.630]  are going to need the most attention
[16:49.630 --> 16:50.910]  when the power goes out.
[16:50.910 --> 16:53.270]  So let's talk about keeping those clones happy and safe
[16:53.270 --> 16:54.470]  when the power goes out.
[16:54.470 --> 16:55.990]  Then we'll talk about the rest of the grow.
[16:55.990 --> 16:58.190]  We'll work our way through the rest of the grow.
[16:58.190 --> 17:01.210]  If you are running your clones in an easy clone
[17:01.210 --> 17:05.250]  or some type of turbo cloner, aeroponic cloning machine,
[17:05.250 --> 17:07.650]  those clones expect their roots, their base,
[17:07.650 --> 17:09.490]  their tips to be wet,
[17:09.490 --> 17:11.810]  maybe constantly at least every few minutes.
[17:11.810 --> 17:13.610]  A lot of people run that sprayer constant.
[17:13.610 --> 17:17.570]  I run mine on a 45 minute on, 15 minute off cycle.
[17:17.570 --> 17:20.130]  Sometimes I'll do it differently based on the environment,
[17:20.130 --> 17:21.810]  availability and needs of the room.
[17:21.810 --> 17:25.210]  But most of the time it's 45 minutes on, 15 minutes off.
[17:25.210 --> 17:26.730]  I keep them wet, keep them wet,
[17:26.730 --> 17:28.850]  turn off that sprayer, let them not dry,
[17:28.850 --> 17:31.330]  but kind of not be soaked for 15 minutes
[17:31.330 --> 17:32.550]  and they don't get root rot that way.
[17:32.550 --> 17:34.890]  That dry time is when the roots really start spreading out,
[17:34.890 --> 17:36.010]  looking for water.
[17:36.010 --> 17:39.850]  So keep some moisture on them, then let it turn off.
[17:39.850 --> 17:41.110]  Now, when the power goes off,
[17:41.110 --> 17:43.810]  that sprayer inside the easy cloner, the turbo cloner,
[17:43.810 --> 17:46.070]  whatever aeroponic clone machine you're using,
[17:46.070 --> 17:49.270]  it's not going to spray those clones with water.
[17:49.270 --> 17:51.290]  Within a couple of hours, they're gonna start saying,
[17:51.290 --> 17:52.490]  depending on their age,
[17:52.490 --> 17:54.130]  how far along they are in the process,
[17:54.130 --> 17:55.370]  they're gonna start telling you,
[17:55.370 --> 17:58.730]  hey, we need some water on our roots.
[17:59.570 --> 18:01.370]  The easiest thing to do for the easy cloner
[18:01.370 --> 18:02.810]  is to get a spray bottle,
[18:02.810 --> 18:04.730]  like the kind you use to clean the windows or whatever,
[18:04.730 --> 18:07.290]  get a clean one, buy a clean, fresh spray bottle,
[18:07.290 --> 18:09.450]  designate it for purposes like this.
[18:09.450 --> 18:11.110]  Maybe you've got one to use for foliar feed,
[18:11.110 --> 18:13.130]  that will work, just clean it out.
[18:13.130 --> 18:16.090]  Scoop up some of the water out of the easy clone machine
[18:16.090 --> 18:18.530]  and spray the roots of the plant
[18:18.530 --> 18:21.770]  with that water every hour, every 30 minutes.
[18:21.770 --> 18:24.170]  As long as they stay wet, they will not die.
[18:24.170 --> 18:26.410]  You just need to keep those roots wet, just moisten them up.
[18:26.410 --> 18:28.470]  They don't need to be soggy and dripping.
[18:29.210 --> 18:31.030]  The more frequently you can do it, obviously, the better,
[18:31.030 --> 18:33.470]  but you've gotta lift up that dome, spray them,
[18:33.470 --> 18:35.630]  spray down those roots, get every single plant,
[18:35.630 --> 18:37.230]  get them wet, then close it down.
[18:37.230 --> 18:38.590]  Make sure you don't crush any of the roots
[18:38.590 --> 18:39.970]  if you got dangly roots.
[18:40.870 --> 18:42.630]  When you do this, here is,
[18:42.630 --> 18:45.230]  we're gonna talk about this more later on in the episode,
[18:45.230 --> 18:46.790]  but when you do this,
[18:46.790 --> 18:49.730]  make sure that you put that cloner back together properly.
[18:49.730 --> 18:52.330]  A lot of times, we'll set that clone dome back on top,
[18:52.330 --> 18:53.870]  the top of the easy cloner.
[18:53.870 --> 18:55.270]  It's not the dome, it's just the top.
[18:55.270 --> 18:57.190]  We'll set that top back on there
[18:57.190 --> 18:59.150]  and it won't be perfectly on there.
[18:59.150 --> 19:01.070]  Now, when the power does come back on,
[19:01.070 --> 19:02.830]  the water's gonna spray everywhere
[19:02.830 --> 19:04.390]  out of that fucking cloner.
[19:04.390 --> 19:06.190]  Those things are notorious for leaking
[19:06.190 --> 19:07.870]  if you don't pay attention.
[19:07.870 --> 19:11.270]  I take a piece of a neoprene, an extra clone.
[19:11.270 --> 19:13.690]  So when you buy the clone collars, the little circles,
[19:13.690 --> 19:16.070]  they come in like a tray, in a little tray thing.
[19:16.070 --> 19:17.710]  It looks like the thing that a six pack of beer
[19:17.710 --> 19:18.970]  or soda would come in.
[19:18.970 --> 19:20.950]  I keep part of that and I cut shapes out of that
[19:20.950 --> 19:23.350]  to stick in the holes of my easy cloner
[19:23.350 --> 19:26.310]  because they provide you extra holes for more plugs
[19:26.310 --> 19:29.910]  if you wanna put a heater, an air stone, some random shit.
[19:29.910 --> 19:31.670]  There are more in and out spots in there.
[19:31.670 --> 19:34.510]  I use that neoprene to cut little plugs, I guess,
[19:34.510 --> 19:36.510]  to fill those, to plug the dam
[19:36.510 --> 19:37.830]  so there are no leaks in there.
[19:37.830 --> 19:39.550]  So it would be really important to make sure
[19:39.550 --> 19:43.150]  to reassemble that easy cloner completely correctly
[19:43.150 --> 19:45.870]  and anticipate the power coming back on
[19:45.870 --> 19:47.670]  because when the power comes back on,
[19:47.670 --> 19:49.390]  that thing's gonna start spraying from the bottom.
[19:49.390 --> 19:50.510]  If it's not on there correctly,
[19:50.510 --> 19:53.390]  the water will spray out of the gaps, out of the sides.
[19:53.390 --> 19:55.690]  You have no idea how many times I've come home
[19:56.070 --> 19:57.250]  or walked into a commercial facility
[19:57.250 --> 20:00.570]  and just heard, and that easy cloner is just empty
[20:00.570 --> 20:01.650]  and all the water's on the floor
[20:01.650 --> 20:03.630]  and the pump is just cooking itself.
[20:03.630 --> 20:05.890]  You can smell the pump about to burn and fry itself.
[20:05.890 --> 20:08.090]  So the first thing to think about
[20:08.090 --> 20:10.450]  when the power goes out is that easy cloner.
[20:10.450 --> 20:12.810]  Let's get the clones in the easy cloner wet.
[20:12.810 --> 20:14.210]  If you've got regular clones,
[20:14.210 --> 20:16.470]  you're going to need to keep that space warm.
[20:16.470 --> 20:18.390]  If it's in the winter like it is right now,
[20:18.390 --> 20:20.010]  it may get cold quite quickly.
[20:20.010 --> 20:22.290]  You may wanna figure out a way to keep the babies warm
[20:22.290 --> 20:24.770]  because that coldness is gonna be one of the first things
[20:24.770 --> 20:27.130]  that destroys the small plants.
[20:27.130 --> 20:30.250]  I would prefer too much cold for the larger plants
[20:30.250 --> 20:31.210]  compared to too much heat,
[20:31.210 --> 20:32.970]  but for the babies at this point,
[20:32.970 --> 20:35.290]  the cold will really slow down the success
[20:35.290 --> 20:36.570]  and health of your clones.
[20:36.570 --> 20:38.370]  So if you've got a dome, keep them warm.
[20:38.370 --> 20:40.690]  That's the only thing you can ask for.
[20:40.690 --> 20:42.450]  Keep them alive until the power comes on.
[20:42.450 --> 20:45.530]  If you've got a short power outage, this won't be a big deal.
[20:45.530 --> 20:46.930]  If the power's out for a long time,
[20:46.930 --> 20:49.410]  that's when we start getting stressed out on things.
[20:49.410 --> 20:51.090]  We'll talk more about that because the plants,
[20:51.090 --> 20:52.970]  of course, are photo period plants.
[20:53.010 --> 20:55.530]  Long periods of dark can give us problems.
[20:55.530 --> 20:57.570]  All right, so we have addressed the EZ-Cloner.
[20:57.570 --> 21:00.250]  Now let's move our way into the veg area
[21:00.250 --> 21:02.490]  and talk about the plants in veg.
[21:02.490 --> 21:05.030]  The veg plants can handle the power outages quite well
[21:05.030 --> 21:06.850]  because they are just vegging.
[21:06.850 --> 21:07.890]  They're not in flower.
[21:07.890 --> 21:11.970]  They expect 18, maybe 20, maybe 24 hours of daylight.
[21:11.970 --> 21:13.810]  Maybe people do something different,
[21:13.810 --> 21:16.650]  but they just expect a long day of daylight.
[21:16.650 --> 21:19.410]  If the power goes out in your veg room
[21:19.410 --> 21:21.250]  during your daytime cycle,
[21:21.250 --> 21:23.890]  those plants simply think it was cloudy
[21:23.890 --> 21:24.970]  or it was a rainy day,
[21:24.970 --> 21:27.610]  and they just didn't get the light, the photons,
[21:27.610 --> 21:29.170]  the sun energy, the light energy
[21:29.170 --> 21:31.570]  that they would have gotten for that day.
[21:31.570 --> 21:34.490]  So for one day, for a few hours in veg,
[21:34.490 --> 21:36.770]  it shouldn't cause you too many problems.
[21:36.770 --> 21:40.870]  You'll miss that many PAR watts, that many photons,
[21:40.870 --> 21:42.750]  that much PPFD for your plant.
[21:42.750 --> 21:44.010]  It didn't go to the gym that day.
[21:44.010 --> 21:45.010]  It didn't get its vitamins.
[21:45.010 --> 21:45.970]  It didn't eat that day.
[21:45.970 --> 21:47.490]  It just kinda, it was there.
[21:47.490 --> 21:48.450]  It took a couch day.
[21:48.450 --> 21:51.490]  It took a cheat day, a lazy day is what that plant did
[21:51.490 --> 21:54.010]  if you had lights off for just a short period.
[21:54.010 --> 21:55.630]  Now, let's talk about this.
[21:55.630 --> 21:59.410]  We're gonna segue from veg plants to flowering plants.
[21:59.410 --> 22:02.950]  The reason that it matters in the flower room more
[22:02.950 --> 22:05.050]  is because these plants are what we call
[22:05.050 --> 22:06.370]  photo period plants.
[22:06.370 --> 22:08.530]  Some of you are growing auto flowers.
[22:08.530 --> 22:10.850]  What I'm about to say kind of doesn't matter
[22:11.770 --> 22:14.050]  as accurately as much for auto flowers.
[22:14.050 --> 22:14.890]  Let me make that clear.
[22:14.890 --> 22:17.330]  This is for photo period plants.
[22:17.330 --> 22:20.490]  Most cannabis plants are flowering is induced
[22:20.490 --> 22:23.690]  by triggering a light cycle of approximately 12 hours
[22:23.690 --> 22:26.770]  of light, 12 hours of uninterrupted darkness.
[22:26.770 --> 22:28.890]  So let's talk about that.
[22:28.890 --> 22:32.810]  If our veg plants are in dark for too long,
[22:32.810 --> 22:37.150]  they can be triggered to the flowering stage.
[22:37.150 --> 22:41.250]  This could take 24, 48, 36 hours.
[22:41.250 --> 22:43.130]  It could take 72 hours.
[22:43.130 --> 22:44.410]  It's all about the plant.
[22:44.410 --> 22:47.610]  Each plant will have a different critical period
[22:47.610 --> 22:50.130]  in which it will decide to trigger into flower
[22:50.130 --> 22:51.370]  from darkness.
[22:51.370 --> 22:53.370]  So that is up to each individual plant.
[22:53.370 --> 22:56.070]  It'll be possibly phenotype dependent.
[22:56.070 --> 22:58.490]  Definitely it's gonna be strain dependent
[22:58.490 --> 23:00.410]  depending on where your plants are from,
[23:00.410 --> 23:03.090]  depending on how far along those plants are.
[23:03.090 --> 23:05.450]  If they're root bound, if they're more mature,
[23:05.450 --> 23:06.630]  if their hormones are built up
[23:06.630 --> 23:07.970]  and they're ready to go into flower,
[23:07.970 --> 23:10.610]  it may take less darkness for them to switch.
[23:10.610 --> 23:12.610]  If you got small plants that are in big pots
[23:12.610 --> 23:13.530]  and they're not root bound
[23:13.530 --> 23:15.370]  and they've been getting a lot of light,
[23:15.370 --> 23:16.790]  they may not switch as quickly.
[23:16.790 --> 23:18.410]  So it's gonna be all about the plant
[23:18.410 --> 23:20.850]  and a lot of small details will play into this.
[23:20.850 --> 23:22.030]  If you've got veg plants
[23:22.030 --> 23:24.130]  and you are experiencing power outages
[23:24.130 --> 23:25.630]  for a long period of time,
[23:25.630 --> 23:27.850]  you may wanna get some sort of supplemental lighting
[23:27.850 --> 23:29.110]  in there just to wake them up.
[23:29.110 --> 23:31.370]  You could use a powerful flashlight
[23:31.370 --> 23:32.570]  if that's all you've got.
[23:32.570 --> 23:34.930]  If you've got a home grow, like a portable,
[23:34.930 --> 23:37.450]  one of those battery, not the small circle batteries,
[23:37.450 --> 23:39.670]  the big square battery powered flashlight,
[23:39.670 --> 23:41.250]  that bitch will go in there and wake your plants up.
[23:41.250 --> 23:43.730]  Just shine that at the plants every hour
[23:43.730 --> 23:46.330]  for five or 10 minutes and just wake the plants up.
[23:46.330 --> 23:47.370]  They will not go to sleep.
[23:47.370 --> 23:48.970]  They will not go into flower.
[23:48.970 --> 23:51.290]  Now, the flowering plants are more critical
[23:51.290 --> 23:54.810]  because we don't want to interrupt the dark cycle.
[23:54.810 --> 23:56.410]  The reason those plants are flowering
[23:56.410 --> 23:58.390]  is because they're getting 12 hours
[23:58.390 --> 24:00.690]  of uninterrupted darkness.
[24:00.690 --> 24:03.770]  We can kind of mess with the day cycle a little bit.
[24:03.770 --> 24:05.190]  You don't wanna go in there every day
[24:05.190 --> 24:07.410]  and just unplug the lights and plug them back in
[24:07.410 --> 24:09.210]  and just fuck around and cause some stress
[24:09.210 --> 24:10.050]  and confuse them.
[24:10.050 --> 24:14.890]  But you can disrupt, augment, mess around,
[24:14.890 --> 24:17.450]  play with, torment them during the day cycle
[24:17.450 --> 24:19.930]  to a minimum without causing problems.
[24:19.930 --> 24:23.170]  If the power goes out during the light cycle,
[24:23.170 --> 24:24.210]  it's just like they're not getting,
[24:24.210 --> 24:25.130]  like I said a moment ago,
[24:25.130 --> 24:26.570]  they're not getting their light energy.
[24:26.570 --> 24:29.010]  Light is the main source of energy for the plants.
[24:29.010 --> 24:31.570]  Light is what triggers everything else to happen.
[24:31.570 --> 24:33.010]  That's what tells them to eat.
[24:33.010 --> 24:34.530]  That's what creates photosynthesis.
[24:34.530 --> 24:36.170]  Everything comes from the light.
[24:36.170 --> 24:38.850]  So that light starts the whole process of a plant.
[24:38.850 --> 24:41.250]  Without the light, they're not gonna do their processes.
[24:41.250 --> 24:43.650]  They won't die without light for a little bit,
[24:43.650 --> 24:45.530]  but they're not going to make any progress.
[24:45.530 --> 24:46.610]  They're just chilling.
[24:46.610 --> 24:47.450]  They took a day off.
[24:47.450 --> 24:48.290]  They're not at the gym.
[24:48.290 --> 24:49.110]  They're not eating.
[24:49.110 --> 24:50.330]  They're not getting vitamins.
[24:50.330 --> 24:51.170]  They're just chilling out.
[24:51.170 --> 24:53.250]  You're also not spending anything on the light.
[24:53.250 --> 24:55.770]  And you probably won't lose anything from one,
[24:55.770 --> 24:57.770]  maybe two short power outages,
[24:57.770 --> 25:01.070]  but you don't want it to be a regular, consistent thing.
[25:01.070 --> 25:04.330]  Now, we can interrupt the daytime cycle.
[25:04.330 --> 25:07.330]  What you cannot do is have light problems
[25:07.330 --> 25:08.650]  during the night cycle.
[25:09.450 --> 25:12.130]  We cannot get lights interrupting our sleeping process.
[25:12.130 --> 25:13.330]  Think of it like this.
[25:14.730 --> 25:17.290]  If you are, if it's during the day and I'm like,
[25:17.290 --> 25:19.210]  hey, let's turn off the lights and watch a movie.
[25:19.210 --> 25:20.050]  That's fine.
[25:20.050 --> 25:20.870]  People are cool.
[25:20.870 --> 25:22.490]  Turn off the lights, watch a movie, play their phone.
[25:22.490 --> 25:23.490]  When the lights come back on,
[25:23.490 --> 25:26.010]  you're just like kind of lazy, lethargic, good movie,
[25:26.010 --> 25:27.590]  nice cuddle time with the chick or whatever,
[25:27.590 --> 25:29.170]  with the dude, if that's your thing,
[25:29.170 --> 25:30.250]  or if you're a lady or whatever,
[25:30.250 --> 25:31.930]  anyway, you know what I'm saying.
[25:31.930 --> 25:33.530]  Come out of the dark time, you're fine.
[25:33.530 --> 25:36.450]  However, if you go to bed and halfway through your bedtime,
[25:36.450 --> 25:37.450]  I turn on all the lights
[25:37.450 --> 25:39.090]  and start fucking playing the drums,
[25:39.090 --> 25:40.250]  you're gonna be pissed off.
[25:40.250 --> 25:41.970]  The plants are kind of the same way.
[25:41.970 --> 25:44.850]  The plants, however, will express intersex traits
[25:44.850 --> 25:46.730]  and produce seeds, possibly.
[25:46.730 --> 25:48.450]  I'm not going to turn intersex.
[25:48.450 --> 25:50.730]  I hope you don't turn intersex from a light problem
[25:50.730 --> 25:52.250]  and I hope you don't make seeds,
[25:52.250 --> 25:54.410]  but that is what happens when you fuck with the plants.
[25:54.410 --> 25:57.250]  The plants can take a light interruption
[25:57.250 --> 25:58.330]  during their light time.
[25:58.330 --> 25:59.690]  They could take a light interruption.
[25:59.690 --> 26:02.070]  They can't take a dark interruption during the dark time.
[26:02.070 --> 26:03.550]  I hope that makes sense.
[26:03.550 --> 26:05.130]  Don't fuck with them when they're sleeping.
[26:05.130 --> 26:06.690]  When they're awake, it's okay.
[26:06.690 --> 26:09.530]  Now let's segue into a very important part
[26:09.530 --> 26:12.050]  of the power outage discussion.
[26:12.050 --> 26:17.050]  Get everything back on track as soon as possible.
[26:17.330 --> 26:19.970]  If you're getting, if you know the power is gonna flicker,
[26:19.970 --> 26:23.050]  go off and on multiple times for the next few hours,
[26:23.050 --> 26:25.490]  maybe just go unplug everything for a little bit.
[26:25.490 --> 26:28.850]  It is less stressful on you, first of all.
[26:28.850 --> 26:30.170]  You're not gonna freak out as much
[26:30.170 --> 26:32.450]  if you don't hear your grow light going
[26:32.450 --> 26:35.450]  or your fans and your air conditioners coming on.
[26:35.650 --> 26:38.890]  Oh, and then turning off.
[26:38.890 --> 26:40.210]  Oh shit, I thought it was gonna come on.
[26:40.210 --> 26:41.250]  You get all excited.
[26:41.250 --> 26:44.130]  Also, so did the equipment, so did the plants.
[26:44.130 --> 26:46.770]  So it's less stressful on you, the plants,
[26:46.770 --> 26:48.370]  and the equipment to just unplug it.
[26:48.370 --> 26:50.070]  You don't need the light coming on.
[26:50.070 --> 26:51.570]  Depending on what kind of lights you've got,
[26:51.570 --> 26:52.910]  if you've got old HBS lights,
[26:52.910 --> 26:55.330]  you don't want those coming on, running for 15,
[26:55.330 --> 26:57.430]  and then getting shut off and then coming back on
[26:57.430 --> 26:58.610]  because that is a cold start,
[26:58.610 --> 27:01.890]  which is very bad for the bulb and the ballast.
[27:01.890 --> 27:04.090]  So just unplug your gear if you know you're gonna have
[27:04.090 --> 27:06.570]  intermittent power outages for the next couple of hours.
[27:06.570 --> 27:07.930]  Just unplug it.
[27:07.930 --> 27:10.970]  But make sure to get everything back on schedule
[27:10.970 --> 27:12.930]  as soon as possible.
[27:12.930 --> 27:15.490]  Don't forget about every single fan.
[27:15.490 --> 27:17.490]  If you've got an EZ-Cloner on a timer,
[27:17.490 --> 27:18.890]  readjust that timer.
[27:18.890 --> 27:20.490]  If your lights are on a timer,
[27:20.490 --> 27:22.570]  they come off and on at a certain time,
[27:22.570 --> 27:23.850]  make sure they are reset.
[27:23.850 --> 27:25.210]  If you've got those dial timers,
[27:25.210 --> 27:28.530]  you've got to manually return that timer to go back on.
[27:28.530 --> 27:30.370]  If the power went off on some timers
[27:30.370 --> 27:31.770]  and it doesn't have a battery backup,
[27:31.770 --> 27:33.790]  you've got to reset the timer.
[27:33.790 --> 27:38.550]  Many timers have an on, off, auto button.
[27:38.550 --> 27:40.790]  When they come back on from a power outage,
[27:40.790 --> 27:42.430]  they flip to the on switch.
[27:42.430 --> 27:44.150]  You've got to put it back on auto.
[27:44.150 --> 27:47.750]  It may not go off when you're expecting it to go off.
[27:47.750 --> 27:49.210]  Double check everything.
[27:49.210 --> 27:52.170]  If it is plugged in and you expect it to cycle
[27:52.170 --> 27:54.910]  in some sort of way, double check it.
[27:54.910 --> 27:58.270]  Your fans, your air conditioners, your dehumidifier,
[27:58.270 --> 28:00.870]  your humidifier, your humidistat,
[28:00.870 --> 28:03.190]  whatever comes on to get rid of humidity in the room,
[28:03.190 --> 28:05.270]  make sure that all of that stuff has been reset.
[28:05.270 --> 28:06.990]  If you are running any sort of
[28:06.990 --> 28:10.430]  electronic digital monitoring devices,
[28:10.430 --> 28:12.830]  recalibrate and relink with that.
[28:12.830 --> 28:15.470]  If you've got a Smart B, if you've got a PL Grow system,
[28:15.470 --> 28:17.950]  if you've got a, what's the other brand, a Pulse,
[28:17.950 --> 28:21.670]  make sure that is all recalibrated, reconnected, and reset
[28:21.670 --> 28:23.590]  so that you know you're getting your notifications
[28:23.590 --> 28:25.750]  and your alerts and that it's paying attention.
[28:25.750 --> 28:27.710]  Sometimes when those things get unplugged,
[28:27.710 --> 28:29.390]  they lose their connection to your phone,
[28:29.390 --> 28:32.070]  your modem, your device, your router, your gateway.
[28:32.110 --> 28:33.310]  Whatever century you live in,
[28:33.310 --> 28:34.990]  whatever you call it, wherever you are,
[28:34.990 --> 28:38.150]  you may need to reconnect your monitoring equipment.
[28:38.150 --> 28:41.990]  So as soon as possible, get all of your stuff back on cycle
[28:41.990 --> 28:44.990]  because it is, like I said earlier,
[28:44.990 --> 28:46.830]  we cannot, it is less critical
[28:46.830 --> 28:49.550]  to keep your dark cycle on time.
[28:49.550 --> 28:51.830]  So if you're gonna get your dark cycle back on time,
[28:51.830 --> 28:54.430]  make sure nothing's gonna come on during that night cycle
[28:54.430 --> 28:56.230]  that you don't think is gonna come on.
[28:56.230 --> 28:57.790]  Get all your timers synced back up,
[28:57.790 --> 28:59.670]  get all of your blowers synced back up.
[28:59.670 --> 29:01.950]  Everything needs to be checked.
[29:02.790 --> 29:03.630]  But like I said a minute ago,
[29:03.630 --> 29:05.430]  if you think you're going to keep experiencing
[29:05.430 --> 29:08.030]  more power outages, if the wind is still blowing,
[29:08.030 --> 29:09.430]  if the snow is still coming down,
[29:09.430 --> 29:11.550]  if the trucks are still out there working on it,
[29:11.550 --> 29:12.790]  just leave that shit unplugged
[29:12.790 --> 29:15.470]  because it is more stressful on the plants.
[29:15.470 --> 29:17.870]  Just imagine if you took a nap and every couple of hours
[29:17.870 --> 29:19.590]  they're like, psych, we're turning the lights on.
[29:19.590 --> 29:21.310]  You're like, ah, shit, man, come on.
[29:21.310 --> 29:22.550]  That's like torture for people.
[29:22.550 --> 29:24.710]  It's gotta be torture for the plants as well.
[29:24.710 --> 29:27.150]  We don't wanna stress them, intersex them,
[29:27.150 --> 29:29.230]  give them any more struggles than they need.
[29:29.230 --> 29:31.030]  So if you know the power is gonna keep flickering
[29:31.030 --> 29:32.710]  and problems are gonna keep happening,
[29:32.710 --> 29:35.190]  just unplug everything, let it all chill.
[29:35.190 --> 29:37.230]  It's free, they're just resting.
[29:37.230 --> 29:39.110]  As long as you get some light on them,
[29:39.110 --> 29:41.270]  within the next 18 hours or so,
[29:41.270 --> 29:42.670]  your plants won't go into flower.
[29:42.670 --> 29:44.350]  You just need a couple of hours,
[29:44.350 --> 29:46.390]  maybe a few minutes of light if that's all you can do,
[29:46.390 --> 29:48.310]  but keep doing that every few hours
[29:48.310 --> 29:50.150]  to keep them from going into flower.
[29:50.150 --> 29:52.270]  Your plants will be okay.
[29:52.270 --> 29:54.910]  It is better to have too cold than too hot.
[29:54.910 --> 29:57.230]  There is a story of a power outage
[29:57.230 --> 29:59.430]  for several days in Canada,
[29:59.470 --> 30:02.230]  and a lot of people, their crops did survive.
[30:02.230 --> 30:04.510]  But as soon as you are certain that everything is restored,
[30:04.510 --> 30:06.270]  the power crews are gone, the wind is gone,
[30:06.270 --> 30:08.910]  the snow is starting to melt, go in the grow,
[30:08.910 --> 30:10.910]  start in the flower room, start in the bedroom,
[30:10.910 --> 30:12.870]  work your way up or down, however you do it,
[30:12.870 --> 30:15.350]  but check everything that is plugged in,
[30:15.350 --> 30:18.790]  every light, every timer, every fan, every blower.
[30:18.790 --> 30:20.710]  Like I said before, all of your electronics,
[30:20.710 --> 30:23.110]  all of your monitoring stuff.
[30:23.110 --> 30:24.390]  If you have cameras in the grow
[30:24.390 --> 30:25.790]  that are connected to your wifi,
[30:25.790 --> 30:27.750]  they may need to be reconnected.
[30:27.750 --> 30:30.070]  Check on all of that stuff before you leave,
[30:30.070 --> 30:32.390]  before you go anywhere, before you head out for work again,
[30:32.390 --> 30:33.990]  before you go to the friend's house,
[30:33.990 --> 30:34.830]  because when you get there,
[30:34.830 --> 30:36.630]  you're gonna wanna check your VPD,
[30:36.630 --> 30:37.710]  you're gonna wanna look at the grow,
[30:37.710 --> 30:38.550]  and you're gonna go, ah,
[30:38.550 --> 30:40.790]  I didn't fucking recalibrate the cameras.
[30:40.790 --> 30:43.110]  I didn't redo the PL minder unit.
[30:43.110 --> 30:44.270]  None of my shit works.
[30:44.270 --> 30:46.630]  I gotta go home, because I'm paranoid about my grow.
[30:46.630 --> 30:49.030]  So set yourself up for success.
[30:49.030 --> 30:52.430]  Go in there, reset all your timers, reprogram everything.
[30:53.310 --> 30:55.750]  When the lights are supposed to go off,
[30:55.750 --> 30:57.110]  don't have faith that they went off.
[30:57.470 --> 30:58.990]  Go in there and actually physically check.
[30:58.990 --> 31:01.070]  If you've got a timer set for 10 p.m.,
[31:01.070 --> 31:04.270]  set an alarm on your phone for 10 p.m. when it's 10 p.m.,
[31:04.270 --> 31:05.110]  go look.
[31:05.110 --> 31:05.950]  Did the lights go off?
[31:05.950 --> 31:07.390]  Is there light coming from under the door,
[31:07.390 --> 31:08.390]  from out of the tent?
[31:08.390 --> 31:10.510]  Do you hear the blower that you're supposed to hear?
[31:10.510 --> 31:13.510]  If you got a fan that should come on at one time, go check.
[31:13.510 --> 31:15.030]  Go check for just a couple of cycles.
[31:15.030 --> 31:16.950]  Make sure you got your rhythms back in place.
[31:16.950 --> 31:19.470]  Set yourself up for success.
[31:19.470 --> 31:21.270]  All right, I feel like I got rambly on that one,
[31:21.270 --> 31:24.030]  so let me recap, and then we'll wrap up this podcast.
[31:24.030 --> 31:26.230]  If you are experiencing power outages,
[31:26.230 --> 31:27.630]  make sure the most important thing
[31:27.630 --> 31:31.030]  is to get everything back on track as soon as possible.
[31:31.030 --> 31:34.790]  It is okay to interrupt the daytime cycle on a cannabis plant
[31:34.790 --> 31:36.850]  because it is a photo period plant.
[31:36.850 --> 31:40.350]  It is not okay to interrupt the nighttime cycle.
[31:40.350 --> 31:41.790]  Do your best to get those plants
[31:41.790 --> 31:43.750]  back on their regular cycle.
[31:43.750 --> 31:45.790]  Maybe sometimes you'll just have to leave them off
[31:45.790 --> 31:46.710]  for a while.
[31:46.710 --> 31:47.870]  Don't change any timers.
[31:47.870 --> 31:49.710]  Don't do anything weird shit like that.
[31:49.710 --> 31:53.310]  Just get them back to their regularly scheduled program
[31:53.310 --> 31:54.430]  as soon as possible.
[31:54.430 --> 31:57.430]  If the power went off and then nighttime came,
[31:57.430 --> 31:58.870]  just let them have that long day,
[31:58.870 --> 32:00.710]  that full night they would normally get.
[32:00.710 --> 32:03.270]  Tomorrow, whatever time the timer should come on,
[32:03.270 --> 32:05.110]  get it back on schedule right then.
[32:05.110 --> 32:08.130]  Get right back to your program as soon as possible.
[32:08.130 --> 32:08.970]  Don't fuck around.
[32:08.970 --> 32:09.830]  Don't waste more time.
[32:09.830 --> 32:12.430]  Don't confuse those plants any more than necessary.
[32:12.430 --> 32:13.970]  Get them back on their pattern.
[32:13.970 --> 32:15.070]  Get them back to class.
[32:15.070 --> 32:16.110]  Get them learning again.
[32:16.110 --> 32:17.870]  Get them back in the gym.
[32:17.870 --> 32:19.390]  So, get back on schedule.
[32:19.390 --> 32:20.790]  You can interrupt that daytime.
[32:20.790 --> 32:22.210]  Can interrupt the nighttime.
[32:22.210 --> 32:24.230]  If you think you're gonna get a lot of interruptions,
[32:25.030 --> 32:25.870]  just unplug them.
[32:25.870 --> 32:26.690]  It is okay.
[32:26.690 --> 32:29.630]  If you have a long extended couple of days without light,
[32:29.630 --> 32:30.910]  you do need to get something in there.
[32:30.910 --> 32:33.470]  Get some light on those plants just to wake them up.
[32:33.470 --> 32:35.110]  If they're in flower, let them go.
[32:35.110 --> 32:36.410]  You don't even have to mess with them.
[32:36.410 --> 32:38.070]  They will keep flowering.
[32:38.070 --> 32:40.070]  Pay attention to the water level.
[32:40.070 --> 32:41.310]  Just because it's dark doesn't mean
[32:41.310 --> 32:42.750]  they're not gonna need some water.
[32:42.750 --> 32:44.030]  All right, I think that's all I've got for you.
[32:44.030 --> 32:46.230]  I'm gonna wrap it up while it's nice and tight.
