[00:23.000 --> 00:24.000]  Man, what you gonna do now?
[00:24.000 --> 00:26.000]  What we gonna do right here is go back.

[00:27.000 --> 00:28.000]  Way back.
[00:28.000 --> 00:31.000]  As we go a little something like this.
[00:31.000 --> 00:32.000]  Hit it.
[00:33.000 --> 00:35.000]  Yeah, what's up podcast world?
[00:35.000 --> 00:40.000]  It's Thursday and that means it's time for another Throwback Thursday episode of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:40.000 --> 00:43.000]  Before we get to the old episodes, let me make a quick disclaimer.
[00:43.000 --> 00:49.000]  If I mention any advertising, any giveaways, any promotions or any contests, all of that stuff has expired.
[00:49.000 --> 00:54.000]  There are no advertisements, promotions, giveaways or contests that are valid in these old episodes.

[00:57.000 --> 01:01.000]  here's a block of old episodes of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:02.000 --> 01:18.900]  Welcome back cannabis community.
[01:18.900 --> 01:21.900]  It's time for episode number 173 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:21.900 --> 01:25.900]  Your source for cannabis news, education and conversation.
[01:25.900 --> 01:30.900]  That's right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[01:30.900 --> 01:34.900]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[01:34.900 --> 01:37.900]  this my friends is the podcast for you.
[01:37.900 --> 01:39.900]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:39.900 --> 01:41.900]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[01:41.900 --> 01:45.900]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[01:45.900 --> 01:47.900]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[01:47.900 --> 01:51.900]  Big shout out to Kat, Coot and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:52.900 --> 01:53.900]  Happy New Year everybody.
[01:53.900 --> 01:57.900]  If I plan this right, this will be coming out right at the start of 2017.
[01:57.900 --> 01:59.900]  I want to wish everybody a happy new year.
[01:59.900 --> 02:05.900]  I hope 2016 was perfect for you, but I hope 2017 is even better.
[02:05.900 --> 02:08.900]  I've got a lot of great shit lined up for myself in 2017.
[02:08.900 --> 02:10.900]  I've got good things lined up for the podcast.
[02:10.900 --> 02:12.900]  I have great stuff lined up for iRegenetics.
[02:12.900 --> 02:16.900]  I hope everything goes your way in 2017.
[02:16.900 --> 02:20.900]  I want to thank everybody for listening all the way through 2016.
[02:20.900 --> 02:22.900]  We're 173 episodes in you guys.
[02:22.900 --> 02:23.900]  I am proud. I am impressed.
[02:23.900 --> 02:25.900]  I want to thank you guys for joining me on this journey.
[02:25.900 --> 02:30.900]  Also, I want to give a huge shout out to my friend, the Dabbing Granny and all of my friends that joined us.
[02:30.900 --> 02:33.900]  We had a little private party just a few days ago.
[02:33.900 --> 02:36.900]  We all met up somewhere and we hung out and took some dabs.
[02:37.900 --> 02:38.900]  Let's see. Who was there?
[02:38.900 --> 02:41.900]  There were a lot of people there, so I'm going to miss a few people.
[02:41.900 --> 02:43.900]  I want to mention my new friend, Jerry.
[02:43.900 --> 02:46.900]  I don't know if Jerry listens to the podcast yet, but I made a new friend named Jerry.
[02:46.900 --> 02:49.900]  He's got a wonderful companion animal with him.
[02:49.900 --> 02:50.900]  His dog is super cool.
[02:50.900 --> 02:54.900]  I also met your better half, but I cannot think of her name.
[02:54.900 --> 02:58.900]  I'm not sure we were properly introduced, but I'm glad that I finally got to meet Jerry.
[02:58.900 --> 02:59.900]  I've heard a lot of cool stuff about you.
[02:59.900 --> 03:01.900]  Honor and a pleasure to meet Jerry.
[03:01.900 --> 03:02.900]  At the party, there was Jerry.
[03:02.900 --> 03:04.900]  There was, of course, the Dabbing Granny.
[03:04.900 --> 03:06.900]  The lovely Camille was there.
[03:06.900 --> 03:08.900]  THC Samuel was there.
[03:08.900 --> 03:10.900]  Bobo Blaster Co. was there.
[03:10.900 --> 03:12.900]  Lindsey the Traveling Stoner was there.
[03:12.900 --> 03:18.900]  There was a young man who I never caught his name, but he gave me a dab that we will talk about in just a couple of minutes.
[03:18.900 --> 03:20.900]  There were a lot of people there, you guys.
[03:20.900 --> 03:24.900]  I can't even try to go through the list of all the people that were at the little gathering that I participated in,
[03:24.900 --> 03:28.900]  but I want to give the Dabbing Granny a huge shout-out for inviting me to the party.
[03:28.900 --> 03:29.900]  We did a gram dab together.
[03:29.900 --> 03:37.900]  I promised everybody on Instagram that if I got up to 10,000 Instagram followers, I would do a one-gram dab with the Dabbing Granny, and it happened.
[03:37.900 --> 03:40.900]  She gave me a damn grab.
[03:40.900 --> 03:42.900]  Yeah, it was pretty much a damn grab.
[03:42.900 --> 03:48.900]  She gave me a gram dab of OG Kush Distillate, and I took it like a champ.
[03:48.900 --> 03:52.900]  The nail cooled down a little bit too quickly for me to get the whole dab.
[03:52.900 --> 03:57.900]  Once all the Distillate hit the nail, because I just squirted that sucker on there, once it hit the nail, it kind of cooled down.
[03:57.900 --> 03:59.900]  But I took a dab like a champ.
[03:59.900 --> 04:01.900]  So big shout-out to all the people that went to the party.
[04:01.900 --> 04:03.900]  Let's talk about some of these dabs I took, you guys.
[04:03.900 --> 04:06.900]  I took a gram dab of OG Kush Distillate.
[04:06.900 --> 04:14.900]  I heated the nail real hot, and then the Distillate comes in like a—it is a syringe, you guys, but when I say the word syringe, people get freaked out.
[04:14.900 --> 04:17.900]  It's a glass syringe, but it does not have the tip on it.
[04:17.900 --> 04:19.900]  It doesn't have the pokey.
[04:19.900 --> 04:20.900]  You can't poke anything with it.
[04:20.900 --> 04:22.900]  It just looks like a syringe.
[04:22.900 --> 04:27.900]  It looks like something you would use to feed a baby bird is what I think it would be best described as.
[04:27.900 --> 04:33.900]  So this little syringe, it's got Distillate in it, raw Distillate, which was—I'm going to turn on the music. I'm sorry.
[04:33.900 --> 04:36.900]  The Distillate is probably 90% THC.
[04:36.900 --> 04:43.900]  There's not a lot of flavor to it, but you put it in these little glass syringes, and it's kind of hard to get out.
[04:43.900 --> 04:47.900]  So I hit it with a torch for a couple of seconds to heat it up and make it more viscous.
[04:47.900 --> 04:54.900]  And then I heat the nail, and the heat from the dab nail and the heat that I applied with my dab torch work together,
[04:54.900 --> 05:01.900]  and I just pressed the tip of the glass syringe onto the dab nail, and I just pressed the plunger of that syringe down,
[05:01.900 --> 05:08.900]  and it took a second to get it going, but once it released, almost all of that dab went onto the nail immediately.
[05:08.900 --> 05:16.900]  So it was just—blah—just one big gush of liquid dabs onto the nail, and I got all that smoke in my brain basically in one big rip.
[05:16.900 --> 05:20.900]  It took two or three breaths to clear the whole thing, but I got most of the smoke in one big rip.
[05:20.900 --> 05:24.900]  It went to my brain immediately. It was amazing.
[05:24.900 --> 05:32.900]  The OG Kush made me melt into the couch. I felt my butt grew roots, and I became part of that couch.
[05:32.900 --> 05:36.900]  I had to set the rig down, and I immediately had to stand up and tell everybody,
[05:36.900 --> 05:42.900]  I have to walk around because if I sit here, I'm going to take a nap at this private party
[05:42.900 --> 05:49.900]  They are not going to appreciate my giant six-foot-five self taking a nap and snoring like an angry bear
[05:49.900 --> 05:53.900]  because it was going to be kind of a hibernation if I laid down at that point. I was recti.
[05:53.900 --> 05:55.900]  So I got up. I walked around for a little bit.
[05:55.900 --> 06:00.900]  Actually, there's a video of this on the Dabbing Granny's Facebook.
[06:00.900 --> 06:05.900]  I'm pretty sure she did it on Facebook Live. I hope it was Facebook Live because anything else, it disappears.
[06:05.900 --> 06:09.900]  So it's probably there on Facebook Live. If you want to check out the Dabbing Granny's Facebook Live, look for it.
[06:09.900 --> 06:13.900]  Either way, look at the Dabbing Granny's Facebook Live. It's on her Instagram, actually.
[06:13.900 --> 06:15.900]  It is on her Instagram, the Dabbing Granny's Instagram.
[06:15.900 --> 06:22.900]  I don't post Dab videos to my Instagram because the Instagram police have been shutting down Instagram accounts
[06:22.900 --> 06:26.900]  in the cannabis community for random reasons, and I do not want to lose my account.
[06:26.900 --> 06:31.900]  So you won't see many smoking videos of me, but you will see some wonderful cannabis photography.
[06:31.900 --> 06:36.900]  I post great pictures of male plants. I post great pictures of my grow. Great stuff like that.
[06:36.900 --> 06:41.900]  The commercial grows that I help in, I post pictures there. The places I go consult, I'll take a nice picture from there sometimes.
[06:41.900 --> 06:45.900]  But I won't post many pictures of myself consuming.
[06:45.900 --> 06:49.900]  So I did this gram dab of Distillate, and I was high as giraffe pussy, you guys.
[06:49.900 --> 06:52.900]  I was spinning around. I was floating, but I was in good shape.
[06:52.900 --> 06:56.900]  Most people probably would have laid on the couch and taken a four or five hour nap.
[06:56.900 --> 07:01.900]  I just had to stand up and walk around, keep myself social, and keep moving, and I was okay with everything.
[07:01.900 --> 07:04.900]  As long as I stayed moving, stayed bouncy, I was okay.
[07:04.900 --> 07:10.900]  Several minutes after I took that dab, another guy whose name I did not catch, he had a beautiful dab rig,
[07:10.900 --> 07:17.900]  a super colorful mini tube with a donut shape on it, fucking gorgeous rig, never caught the dude's name.
[07:17.900 --> 07:22.900]  I apologize. There were a lot of people there. We had a good time together, but I never caught your name.
[07:22.900 --> 07:25.900]  So if you're listening, send me a message. You know who you are.
[07:25.900 --> 07:36.900]  You gave me a dab. So anyway, you guys, the guy I'm talking to gave me a dab of 99.9% THC Isolate, or Isotol, I've heard it called also.
[07:36.900 --> 07:42.900]  But it was basically just THC crystals in a crystal form, not like crystals like you.
[07:42.900 --> 07:47.900]  Like people call THC crystals just the trichomes. They say it's got a lot of crystals.
[07:47.900 --> 07:54.900]  But this was a crystalline form of THC. They have extracted everything and just have THC in this.
[07:54.900 --> 07:59.900]  It looked like salt or sugar chunks or other drugs in a little container.
[07:59.900 --> 08:03.900]  And you just sprinkle a little bit of it into the dab nail. And it didn't have any flavor.
[08:03.900 --> 08:09.900]  When it went in my lungs, I could feel there was some smoke in my lungs or some vapor, I guess it would be in my lungs.
[08:09.900 --> 08:15.900]  But I really didn't get it. It didn't feel normal. It didn't feel like when you smoke flowers.
[08:15.900 --> 08:17.900]  It didn't feel like when I take a dab, there was no chest expansion.
[08:17.900 --> 08:22.900]  Like when I take a dab, I feel my chest expand a little bit. I feel the smoke wanting to get out.
[08:23.900 --> 08:28.900]  This THC dab was super smooth. It went in. I looked at him like, I didn't notice a damn thing.
[08:28.900 --> 08:31.900]  And he nodded. Like when you blow that out, you're going to get fucked up.
[08:31.900 --> 08:37.900]  And I started to blow it out. And when my body made... So guys, I don't know if everybody else does this.
[08:37.900 --> 08:41.900]  But when I'm about to exhale, my lips make a certain thing so that I can exhale at the right speed.
[08:41.900 --> 08:44.900]  So that I don't go and just blow all the air out at once and choke.
[08:44.900 --> 08:47.900]  You kind of... What's the word? You parse your lips a little bit.
[08:48.900 --> 08:50.900]  And you blow it like that, right?
[08:50.900 --> 08:54.900]  When you're blowing off a balloon, you make a certain face. When you're blowing out a dab, you make a certain shape.
[08:54.900 --> 09:01.900]  As soon as I made those muscles to make my lungs, my lips prepared to blow out the dab, I felt how high I was.
[09:01.900 --> 09:06.900]  I went... And I was like, oh God, there it is. And I could feel... I felt my face turn red.
[09:06.900 --> 09:09.900]  I could feel my eyes droop. And that dude goes, yeah, you've noticed that?
[09:09.900 --> 09:11.900]  And Granny goes, that's good shit, isn't it, Jeff?
[09:11.900 --> 09:16.900]  And I couldn't answer her properly as I blew it out. I was like, that's really good.
[09:17.900 --> 09:21.900]  I was high. My arm hair was standing up and moving around.
[09:21.900 --> 09:24.900]  My nipples were hard. I don't know why.
[09:24.900 --> 09:30.900]  Sometimes when I take a giant dab that works well and makes my nips get all hard, my nips were diamond cutters.
[09:30.900 --> 09:35.900]  It was ridiculous. I was intoxicated for a couple of seconds.
[09:35.900 --> 09:38.900]  I had to kind of chill out for a second and get my shit together.
[09:38.900 --> 09:42.900]  The dude had a gorgeous rig, but it had a donut shape at the bottom of it.
[09:42.900 --> 09:48.900]  And he had a nice banger on it, but I couldn't tell you much more about that rig other than my brain remembers that it was colorful and gorgeous.
[09:48.900 --> 09:51.900]  And I can't even remember the dude's name. That's how good that dab was.
[09:51.900 --> 09:54.900]  I'm pretty good at absorbing names and putting names with faces.
[09:54.900 --> 09:58.900]  That dude's fucking face and name, they're gone. The rig is gone.
[09:58.900 --> 10:01.900]  All I remember is the dab, you guys. That's how tremendous that dab was.
[10:01.900 --> 10:05.900]  So also, let's see. What else did I consume at the little party there?
[10:05.900 --> 10:09.900]  Our friend Caleb from Schumet brought some Schumet bars.
[10:09.900 --> 10:13.900]  I have never tried the red velvet bar. I brag all or I boast. I don't know what I do.
[10:13.900 --> 10:16.900]  What do I say? I say I love that banana pudding bar.
[10:16.900 --> 10:19.900]  You guys, the red velvet bar is every bit as good.
[10:19.900 --> 10:25.900]  Although I'm a banana fan, I like the banana more, but that red velvet, I think it's red velvet cake or red velvet, whatever.
[10:25.900 --> 10:30.900]  Delicious, you guys. I had some of that. We passed around a couple candy bars.
[10:30.900 --> 10:35.900]  I ate a couple pieces of that. By the time everything kicked in, I was well medicated for the party.
[10:35.900 --> 10:40.900]  It was a good time. So I guess I've just been bragging about all the cool shit I got to smoke and eat.
[10:40.900 --> 10:44.900]  I'm sorry. No, I wanted to share that with you guys. I got to smoke OG Kush distillate.
[10:44.900 --> 10:50.900]  I did a gram dab. I got to smoke probably a .2 or a .3 of 99% THC.
[10:50.900 --> 10:53.900]  And then of course we took 10 or 20 normal shatter dabs.
[10:53.900 --> 10:57.900]  Granny had some lemon shatter that was delicious.
[10:57.900 --> 11:00.900]  Our friend Lindsey and Bobo had some tangy shatter that was delicious.
[11:00.900 --> 11:03.900]  Everybody that showed up had some great concentrate.
[11:03.900 --> 11:06.900]  I want to give Granny a big, huge shout out. Granny put the whole party together.
[11:06.900 --> 11:09.900]  She made sure everybody showed up. She had a place put together for us.
[11:09.900 --> 11:13.900]  I want to give a huge shout out to the place that let us have our little gathering.
[11:13.900 --> 11:18.900]  I'm not sure we were supposed to be smoking so many dabs and flowers in that place, but we did.
[11:18.900 --> 11:22.900]  We also smoked a bunch of great flower in there. I took some flowers.
[11:22.900 --> 11:27.900]  Hey, you guys, I normally don't smoke a bunch of flower, but I took some great flowers that I grew and I was sharing those with my friends.
[11:27.900 --> 11:31.900]  And people were really pleased with my most recent harvest. So that was a good time.
[11:32.900 --> 11:35.900]  Big shout out to Granny. Big shout out to everybody that made it to the party.
[11:35.900 --> 11:38.900]  Since I'm giving shout outs, I want to give a huge shout out to my friend Tater.
[11:38.900 --> 11:43.900]  Tater Glass. Tater came through huge, you guys. Tater Glass is a glass artist.
[11:43.900 --> 11:47.900]  He has made me a couple of few custom glass pencils. Right now I'm holding my...
[11:47.900 --> 11:52.900]  This is green. I'm not sure what type of green this is, but it has a red, yellow, and green wig wag.
[11:52.900 --> 11:57.900]  It's got more wig than wag to it at the tip or at the pencil or the eraser end. I'm sorry.
[11:57.900 --> 12:00.900]  At the writing tip, it is red, gold, and green. Rasta colors.
[12:00.900 --> 12:03.900]  They're kind of twisted. It looks pretty sweet. It's a great looking pencil.
[12:03.900 --> 12:07.900]  On the eraser end where the eraser would be, you guys, it has got a lion.
[12:07.900 --> 12:11.900]  I think you guys would call it a millie. I think it actually is a marini.
[12:11.900 --> 12:15.900]  But it's a great looking lion on the tip. Great pencil from my friend Tater Glass.
[12:15.900 --> 12:18.900]  Also, I've got this blue pencil from Tater.
[12:18.900 --> 12:23.900]  It is clear and it's got some glacier blue on one end with a cobalt on the other end.
[12:23.900 --> 12:29.900]  With a cobalt blue, glacier blue swirl on the tip. Great looking pencil. I love that.
[12:29.900 --> 12:35.900]  Then I've got this green one. I think this might be Haterade or Green Stardust. I'm not sure.
[12:35.900 --> 12:39.900]  Then it's got some purple on both tips of it. Sweet pencils.
[12:39.900 --> 12:43.900]  I'm not even sure what half of these colors that these glass artists use are called anymore
[12:43.900 --> 12:50.900]  because they're making more colors. There's no purple or blue. It's like plum or blue stardust.
[12:50.900 --> 12:54.900]  Red is called Red Elvis. So the color names are pretty awesome.
[12:54.900 --> 12:58.900]  If you don't call it the right name, a glass artist will fucking correct you really quickly.
[12:58.900 --> 13:02.900]  But the reason I want to give Tater an extra huge shout out is because right around Christmas,
[13:02.900 --> 13:04.900]  I got an idea that I should get one more gift for somebody.
[13:04.900 --> 13:08.900]  And I decided that I wanted to get them a custom made Tater Glass pencil.
[13:08.900 --> 13:12.900]  They kept talking about wanting something sparkly green and glass.
[13:12.900 --> 13:15.900]  And I thought, let's get a sparkly green glass Tater pencil.
[13:15.900 --> 13:23.900]  So I was able to get a green stardust and blue glacier Tater Glass pencil with a Grateful Dead Bear.
[13:23.900 --> 13:27.900]  You guys are calling them Millies, but I think they're marinis.
[13:27.900 --> 13:31.900]  But it's got a Grateful Dead Marini or a Millie at the end of it. It looks great.
[13:31.900 --> 13:35.900]  Big thanks to my buddy Tater. Dude, I appreciate it. We're only Instagram friends.
[13:35.900 --> 13:39.900]  We need to be real friends, bro. We need to get together and use these pencils that we've got
[13:39.900 --> 13:42.900]  and take some fat globs together. So shout out to my friend Tater Glass.
[13:42.900 --> 13:47.900]  Big thanks for the gift. He made it really quickly after I asked for it.
[13:47.900 --> 13:50.900]  He shipped it the next day and it got to me within two days.
[13:50.900 --> 13:53.900]  So mad love. Great work. I appreciate it.
[13:53.900 --> 13:57.900]  You guys, there is some real content to this podcast. I do have a huge topic to talk about,
[13:57.900 --> 14:02.900]  but you know how I do it. Before we get that far, I've got to do one super duper important ad.
[14:02.900 --> 14:05.900]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friends at Handmade Apparel.
[14:05.900 --> 14:10.900]  That's right. If you need some shirts printed, if you need hoodies printed, if you need some stickers made,
[14:10.900 --> 14:16.900]  if you need some hat pins designed, my friends at Handmade Apparel can take care of all of your custom printing needs.
[14:16.900 --> 14:21.900]  All you need to do is visit handmadeapparel.biz or send them an email.
[14:21.900 --> 14:26.900]  It's Adam at handmadeapparel.biz. See what they can do for you. I'm sure you will be impressed.
[14:26.900 --> 14:32.900]  You guys, they handle all of my printing because they're the ones who I trust and I am super picky.
[14:32.900 --> 14:38.900]  I'm super meticulous about how things are done and I really like the way that these guys do things.
[14:38.900 --> 14:44.900]  I've got these Grow From Your Heart podcast hoodies. The logos are so fresh on there.
[14:44.900 --> 14:48.900]  I was blown away when I opened them out of the package. Chris and Lindsay came by and picked up theirs.
[14:48.900 --> 14:51.900]  They were super proud and super impressed with them. I've got a few left.
[14:51.900 --> 14:56.900]  If you were interested in a Grow From Your Heart podcast hoodie, send me an email.
[14:56.900 --> 15:01.900]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com. I would love to tell you how to get one of these hoodies in your hands.
[15:01.900 --> 15:05.900]  All right. Let's see. What else do we need to talk about? My breeding projects.
[15:05.900 --> 15:07.900]  You guys love it when I give you breeding updates.
[15:07.900 --> 15:11.900]  I have actually gotten emails saying what happened to the breeding updates because I don't do it on every episode.
[15:11.900 --> 15:17.900]  So let's talk about it. I am currently, we are, today is probably day 60.
[15:17.900 --> 15:21.900]  The day that I am recording is 60 days into flower on a breeding project.
[15:21.900 --> 15:26.900]  Those plants were hit with pollen around, it was around day 25. I've got it written down.
[15:26.900 --> 15:31.900]  I don't remember off the top of my hand. Approximately 25 days into flower, those plants received pollen.
[15:31.900 --> 15:39.900]  We are now 60 days in. Occasionally, every couple of days, I will go take one seed from a plant, just a random plant.
[15:39.900 --> 15:46.900]  Not random. I have a kind of a, there's a method to my madness, but I'll pick a plant and I will pull a seed from near the middle of the plant.
[15:46.900 --> 15:50.900]  There are a lot of bud sites. There are a lot of seeds in there. So pulling one seed off, I can see the seeds.
[15:50.900 --> 15:53.900]  They're swelling up in the buds. I will pull one off of there.
[15:53.900 --> 15:59.900]  A couple of days ago, I pulled one seed out of flow and the seed was hard.
[15:59.900 --> 16:03.900]  The outside was the right color. The outside was the right texture.
[16:03.900 --> 16:07.900]  I squeezed it and I could feel that it was a little bit soft, so it wasn't fully developed.
[16:07.900 --> 16:12.900]  It took my fingernail to crack the shell. I used my thumbnail and got through the shell
[16:12.900 --> 16:16.900]  and I could tell that the inside was very white and the seed was not quite done.
[16:16.900 --> 16:20.900]  But we are very few days away from those seeds being ready.
[16:20.900 --> 16:26.900]  So the breeding project is almost completed. I have stopped feeding nutrients.
[16:26.900 --> 16:30.900]  They're just getting clean water now. They'll just get clean water for the next few days until I do cut them down.
[16:30.900 --> 16:38.900]  There's not a lot of material there, but the leftover material will get turned into shatter so that we can smoke some dabs out of the stuff that is left over.
[16:39.900 --> 16:47.900]  Pretty soon, there will be new seeds. I'm guessing within the next 5 to 10 days, those plants will get cut down.
[16:47.900 --> 16:51.900]  I will cut them down. They'll hang upside down. I'll cut off all the large leaves very soon here.
[16:51.900 --> 16:55.900]  I'll cut them down. I'll hang them upside down. I'll let them get really dry.
[16:55.900 --> 17:00.900]  Then I will just lay them in long Tupperware dishes is what they are.
[17:00.900 --> 17:04.900]  I cut them into little sections and lay them in Tupperware dishes and just let them get real dry.
[17:04.900 --> 17:07.900]  Then the buds start crumbling up and the seeds start falling out.
[17:07.900 --> 17:12.900]  When I have some spare time, I just sit there with some rubber gloves, like these black nitrile gloves.
[17:12.900 --> 17:16.900]  I sit there with those on and just crunch up the buds. You can hear the seeds fall out.
[17:16.900 --> 17:18.900]  Tink, tink, tink, tink, tink, tink.
[17:18.900 --> 17:20.900]  Then just tip the container to one side and all the seeds roll to one end.
[17:20.900 --> 17:22.900]  All the bud material stays at the other.
[17:22.900 --> 17:26.900]  Take the seeds out and put them in a labeled jar. Keep them all together.
[17:26.900 --> 17:32.900]  Then what will happen is I'll leave them open. Since they sat out for a long time, they'll probably be plenty dry.
[17:32.900 --> 17:34.900]  If there's any moisture in those seeds, I'll leave them open.
[17:34.900 --> 17:41.900]  I'll seal them up and let them sit for a few days and think about who I want to give them to so that I can have some of my friends grow out some of my new stuff.
[17:41.900 --> 17:46.900]  That's what I like to do. I'll also grow a whole shit ton of it by myself. I always do that.
[17:46.900 --> 17:47.900]  It's a lot of fun.
[17:47.900 --> 17:53.900]  Coming up pretty soon, in the room, the female plants were cookies and cream.
[17:53.900 --> 17:55.900]  There's white widow. There's a flow plant.
[17:55.900 --> 17:57.900]  There's some grateful dog.
[17:57.900 --> 18:03.900]  There are a few Arise plants in there so that we can make some Arise F2s because those seeds are a lot of fun to grow.
[18:03.900 --> 18:07.900]  Arise F2 has been showing some great, great phenotypes.
[18:07.900 --> 18:11.900]  I've been growing a few of those seeds out in little tiny pots and they look great.
[18:11.900 --> 18:13.900]  That's an update on the breeding project.
[18:13.900 --> 18:16.900]  It's nearly done. It's being flushed.
[18:16.900 --> 18:18.900]  Everything looks great. The seeds are getting hard.
[18:18.900 --> 18:23.900]  They're almost ready. Five to 10 days and I will be cutting them down and then they'll dry up.
[18:23.900 --> 18:26.900]  Another five to 10 days from there, I'll start pulling the seeds out.
[18:26.900 --> 18:29.900]  Then another five to 10 days from there, I'll start giving seeds out to my friends.
[18:29.900 --> 18:33.900]  Hopefully five to 10 days from there, people have shit germinated.
[18:33.900 --> 18:40.900]  Then hopefully 120 days from there, we've got pictures and flowers to smoke and all that kind of stuff so that we can see what the crop did.
[18:40.900 --> 18:43.900]  That is my breeding update.
[18:43.900 --> 18:51.900]  The next thing I want to do, you guys, once a month I like to go and read these iTunes comments because if I let them go for more than a month, I seem to forget about them.
[18:51.900 --> 18:55.900]  In the month of December, I received two iTunes comments.
[18:56.900 --> 19:03.900]  If you want to go to iTunes, all you have to do is go to the iTunes store, go to the podcast tab, search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[19:03.900 --> 19:05.900]  Actually, you just go to iTunes.
[19:05.900 --> 19:07.900]  It says library, unplayed, and store.
[19:07.900 --> 19:10.900]  Go to the store, search in Grow From Your Heart, find the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[19:10.900 --> 19:12.900]  Scroll down. It's a little icon. It's got my face on it.
[19:12.900 --> 19:14.900]  I'm sure you know what it looks like by now.
[19:14.900 --> 19:17.900]  Click on there. Go to the ratings and review section.
[19:17.900 --> 19:20.900]  Then there is the option right here to give me some stars.
[19:20.900 --> 19:22.900]  You can give me as many stars as you feel I deserve.
[19:22.900 --> 19:29.900]  So far, ladies and gentlemen, 41 people have given me a five-star review and 35 people have left a written review.
[19:29.900 --> 19:31.900]  We're going to read the two most recent.
[19:31.900 --> 19:37.900]  This one comes from a person who called themselves JJOliveOil08.
[19:37.900 --> 19:39.900]  They left it on December 5th.
[19:39.900 --> 19:45.900]  They said, Jeff is a very positive guy with so many informative things to say about growing and the rest of the industry.
[19:45.900 --> 19:47.900]  That's a great comment.
[19:47.900 --> 19:53.900]  I like hearing that I'm a positive guy, and my goal is to be informative with shit to say about growing in the industry.
[19:53.900 --> 19:55.900]  Excellent. Great review. I appreciate that.
[19:55.900 --> 19:58.900]  Of course, I got five stars, so I appreciate that.
[19:58.900 --> 20:02.900]  Thanks for the comment. Thanks for the five-star rating. I appreciate it. Keep listening.
[20:02.900 --> 20:07.900]  The next comment comes from a person that calls himself SamS37.
[20:07.900 --> 20:09.900]  They said, thanks, Ross to Jeff.
[20:09.900 --> 20:12.900]  I don't know where that weird they said accent came from, but that was new.
[20:12.900 --> 20:15.900]  They said, I've learned a ton from Jeff and the awesome guests.
[20:15.900 --> 20:19.900]  Thanks for sharing your knowledge with the community and helping make the world a better place.
[20:19.900 --> 20:21.900]  Keep fighting the good fight.
[20:21.900 --> 20:24.900]  I appreciate that. I'm glad you're learning from me and my guests.
[20:24.900 --> 20:27.900]  I appreciate that. That's my goal is to teach some people.
[20:27.900 --> 20:30.900]  I'm glad I'm able to share this knowledge with my community.
[20:30.900 --> 20:33.900]  That's what makes a community is sharing, bringing everybody together.
[20:33.900 --> 20:36.900]  And you're right. We are making the world a better place.
[20:36.900 --> 20:41.900]  We're making cannabis better, which makes people less grumpy.
[20:41.900 --> 20:43.900]  It makes them less sick. It makes them happier.
[20:43.900 --> 20:46.900]  The more people have cannabis, the better the world is.
[20:46.900 --> 20:50.900]  I appreciate that. I will keep fighting the good fight as long as I'm able to.
[20:50.900 --> 20:52.900]  I'll keep that up. That's what I'm here for.
[20:52.900 --> 20:56.900]  I'm on it. Thanks for the review, SamS37.
[20:56.900 --> 20:59.900]  You guys, I truly appreciate all of the iTunes reviews.
[20:59.900 --> 21:03.900]  You guys, 35 positive reviews. Nobody had some bad shit to talk.
[21:03.900 --> 21:05.900]  I appreciate that. I love you guys for that.
[21:05.900 --> 21:07.900]  I've gotten 41 five-star ratings.
[21:07.900 --> 21:10.900]  Like I said, if you want to leave me a rating and a review, I would completely love it.
[21:11.900 --> 21:14.900]  If you've got something to say and you don't want to say it here on iTunes,
[21:14.900 --> 21:17.900]  or if you're not an iTunes user or listener, you can send me an email.
[21:17.900 --> 21:20.900]  It's growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[21:20.900 --> 21:23.900]  I would love to hear from you.
[21:23.900 --> 21:26.900]  All right. You guys, I want to give one shout-out,
[21:26.900 --> 21:29.900]  which is going to lead into the main topic of this podcast.
[21:29.900 --> 21:32.900]  But before I do it, I feel like I've been talking for a long time,
[21:32.900 --> 21:34.900]  and I'm also talking very quickly.
[21:34.900 --> 21:37.900]  So I'm going to press pause for one second.
[21:37.900 --> 21:42.900]  I'm going to take two dabs, and then I'm going to take a drink of some tasty gingerade kombucha,
[21:42.900 --> 21:44.900]  and I'll be right back.
[21:44.900 --> 21:47.900]  You probably won't even notice I took a break, because there's just going to be a little brr-brr-brr-brr sound,
[21:47.900 --> 21:49.900]  and I'll be right back.
[21:49.900 --> 21:52.900]  See? I told you I'd be quick.
[21:52.900 --> 21:55.900]  All right, you guys, I am back. I'm heavily medicated now.
[21:55.900 --> 21:57.900]  I got some dabs of Cascade in my head.
[21:57.900 --> 22:00.900]  I just drank some Frosty Cold GTs.
[22:00.900 --> 22:03.900]  I got that gingerade kombucha. I love this stuff.
[22:03.900 --> 22:06.900]  Yeah, I do throw it away when I get to that bottom booger,
[22:06.900 --> 22:08.900]  because I just can't handle that chunky shit at the bottom.
[22:08.900 --> 22:10.900]  So if you're going to talk shit, go for it.
[22:10.900 --> 22:12.900]  But I can't handle that shit, but those GTs is delicious.
[22:12.900 --> 22:15.900]  Anyway, there is a point to this podcast, you guys.
[22:15.900 --> 22:19.900]  I'm going to give a shout-out that will lead me into this point of the podcast.
[22:19.900 --> 22:22.900]  Sorry, I'm adjusting my headphones, getting my shit back together after that dab.
[22:22.900 --> 22:24.900]  My head is spinning a little bit.
[22:24.900 --> 22:28.900]  Apparently, I say the word spliff kind of oddly.
[22:28.900 --> 22:32.900]  I don't do word well with the S-P-L sound for some reason,
[22:32.900 --> 22:34.900]  and then to end it with two Fs fucks me up a lot.
[22:34.900 --> 22:39.900]  Spliff. There is a podcast that I've been listening to called The Spliff Podcast.
[22:39.900 --> 22:43.900]  She spells it POTCAST.
[22:43.900 --> 22:45.900]  The Spliff Podcast is a great show.
[22:45.900 --> 22:50.900]  I've been listening to it for 50-something, probably 60 episodes now.
[22:50.900 --> 22:52.900]  I am completely caught up, and it is a great show.
[22:52.900 --> 22:57.900]  I highly recommend it. Get it? I highly recommend it, because I'm high, and I'm recommending it.
[22:57.900 --> 23:01.900]  But seriously, if you like my podcast, you will enjoy The Spliff Podcast,
[23:01.900 --> 23:04.900]  hosted by, I'm going to call her my new friend, Bo Nellis.
[23:04.900 --> 23:07.900]  I've been listening to her for 60 episodes. I feel like we are buddies now.
[23:07.900 --> 23:10.900]  We're just a dab away from being BFFs.
[23:10.900 --> 23:14.900]  So one of these days, she's going to come to Colorado, because I hate traveling.
[23:14.900 --> 23:16.900]  I don't travel well. She can come to me.
[23:16.900 --> 23:18.900]  She'll come to Colorado. We'll take some dabs together.
[23:18.900 --> 23:21.900]  Come on, Bo. You're invited. Come hang out with Miss Jenny Beth and I.
[23:21.900 --> 23:23.900]  Got a spot for you at the dab table.
[23:23.900 --> 23:27.900]  We'll record a podcast together, and we can both release it at the same time,
[23:27.900 --> 23:30.900]  and we can just do a dual episode. Your audience can be introduced to me.
[23:30.900 --> 23:32.900]  I'll introduce you to my audience, if they haven't already heard you,
[23:32.900 --> 23:35.900]  and we'll get it going like that. But come take a dab with us. It'll be fun.
[23:35.900 --> 23:42.900]  So anyway, Bo does a lot of talk about very specific cannabinoid dosing,
[23:42.900 --> 23:48.900]  and specific strains, and very specific stuff for medicine for patients,
[23:48.900 --> 23:52.900]  which I appreciate. I completely respect it.
[23:52.900 --> 23:58.900]  However, sometimes I do not completely agree, although it's okay to disagree with each other.
[23:58.900 --> 24:02.900]  I'm not mad at you, Bo. I'm just saying sometimes I don't completely agree, which is cool.
[24:02.900 --> 24:10.900]  I think a lot of people are too focused on lab tests, and they're not following their own body,
[24:10.900 --> 24:14.900]  their own intuition. Who's the dude? It was Toucan Sam.
[24:14.900 --> 24:17.900]  He used to say, follow your nose. It always knows.
[24:17.900 --> 24:22.900]  And when it comes to cannabis and selecting cannabis that will work for you,
[24:22.900 --> 24:27.900]  I personally believe that follow your nose because it always knows.
[24:27.900 --> 24:33.900]  The lab tests are great. However, I don't believe 50% of the lab tests that I see
[24:33.900 --> 24:39.900]  because I just saw a 34% THC test for a strain that I think is bullshit, but that's a whole other story.
[24:39.900 --> 24:47.900]  Follow your nose over the lab test. I feel like strains that get your attention are probably good for you.
[24:47.900 --> 24:53.900]  Sometimes your body craves salt. You're probably needing salt or you're thirsty.
[24:53.900 --> 25:00.900]  Sometimes you'll be at the grocery store and you can look at the fruit and you can see seven different kinds of delicious fruit,
[25:00.900 --> 25:03.900]  but one of them calls your name, or maybe it's a vegetable.
[25:03.900 --> 25:08.900]  Something calls your name and it just jumps out and you're like, oh, I want to eat some of that.
[25:08.900 --> 25:14.900]  I feel like your body is programmed to let you know what you want and what you need.
[25:14.900 --> 25:20.900]  When you're thirsty, your body goes, I'm thirsty, and you recognize that because you're lacking water.
[25:20.900 --> 25:25.900]  Maybe if you need some vitamin C and you're walking through the grocery store, you're going to see oranges and your eyes are going to go,
[25:25.900 --> 25:28.900]  that's the thing right there, and you're going to grab it.
[25:28.900 --> 25:32.900]  That's also why I think poop stinks because you're not supposed to eat poop.
[25:32.900 --> 25:40.900]  Whatever you believe in, nature, Jah, God, whoever created us made it perfect.
[25:40.900 --> 25:45.900]  Our poop stinks. We don't want to eat it, and we desire the stuff that our body needs because we're supposed to do that.
[25:45.900 --> 25:49.900]  That's why cannabis smells good because we're supposed to be consuming it, in my opinion.
[25:49.900 --> 25:59.900]  Also, to support my statement, I think physically people who are related don't find each other's pheromones attractive because we're not supposed to be mating.
[25:59.900 --> 26:11.900]  If you're too close in bloodline together, if you're family, you probably won't be turned on by somebody's scent, which sounds weird, but we are attracted to pheromones.
[26:11.900 --> 26:16.900]  Sometimes you'll smell somebody of the opposite sex and you will want to get closer to them.
[26:16.900 --> 26:25.900]  If they're too close to you, you're genetically programmed to not find their smell attractive so that you don't hit on your cousin is what I'm getting at.
[26:25.900 --> 26:28.900]  I think our bodies know. Our bodies give us signals.
[26:28.900 --> 26:38.900]  What I'm really getting at is I think that the medicine, the cannabis that calls at you has probably got something in it that you need to be consuming or that is going to work well for you.
[26:38.900 --> 26:39.900]  That's why it smells so good.
[26:39.900 --> 26:44.900]  Part of what makes me think this, I've been helping out in a large commercial, Grow.
[26:44.900 --> 26:51.900]  I bounce around from Grow to Grow, but I've been in another Grow and my friend James is constantly walking to two very specific plants.
[26:51.900 --> 26:55.900]  James is from the South. We've got a strain called Recon in one of the Grows.
[26:55.900 --> 26:58.900]  Since James is from the South, he calls it Reckon.
[26:58.900 --> 27:04.900]  We just let James call it Reckon because he's James. What are we going to do for the old Southern boy?
[27:04.900 --> 27:09.900]  Reckon always gets his attention. He loves the way Reckon smells.
[27:10.900 --> 27:14.900]  There are four rooms in this facility and they're all in different stages of flower.
[27:14.900 --> 27:21.900]  If you put James in there and you go walk to a plant, you'll always watch him walk over to the Recon and just give it a smell and stand by it.
[27:21.900 --> 27:24.900]  There's also another strain in there. Which one is it? It's called Banana Split.
[27:24.900 --> 27:30.900]  It grows these big purple buds. It's gorgeous, but it's got a smell that James can't stay away from.
[27:30.900 --> 27:38.900]  If you put him in the room to defoliate or do work, he always ends up working on a Reckon or a Banana Split plant because they call him.
[27:38.900 --> 27:45.900]  I think there's something in there that James needs, either recreational or medicinally.
[27:45.900 --> 27:50.900]  I don't even know what it is, but it's calling him. I feel like there's something in that plant that James needs.
[27:50.900 --> 27:54.900]  If James is going to consume cannabis, it should be one of those strains that calls his name.
[27:54.900 --> 28:01.900]  He might not be sick, but that's going to be the one that is the most healing and the most therapeutic for him.
[28:01.900 --> 28:05.900]  I would highly recommend that he tries some of that stuff when it's ready and see what goes on.
[28:06.900 --> 28:11.900]  I've got some more things that I can support my statement that our nose indicates which cannabis is best for us.
[28:11.900 --> 28:16.900]  With my own experience, if you know anything about me, if you pay attention to my breeding projects,
[28:16.900 --> 28:23.900]  a lot of my breeding leans toward the lemony flavored sativa dominant hybrids.
[28:23.900 --> 28:28.900]  I like high THC content and I like a really lemony flavor. I enjoy a citrusy flavor.
[28:29.900 --> 28:37.900]  Something I've noticed when I smoke stuff with an orange flavor, tangerine haze, tangy, the orange creamsicle,
[28:37.900 --> 28:45.900]  orange dreamsicle, agent orange, anything with that orange terp to it, it's a very mellow yet uplifting good mood,
[28:45.900 --> 28:52.900]  good vibe sort of a thing. The oranges is always an anxiety-free, mellow, chilled out.
[28:52.900 --> 28:57.900]  I call it kind of a breakfast high. I like to handle my business in the morning.
[28:57.900 --> 29:02.900]  I do my emails, I do my phone calls, any stuff that's going to require a lot of clarity.
[29:02.900 --> 29:08.900]  I try to get it done before I end up taking my lunchtime dabs because at lunchtime we get down for some dabs.
[29:08.900 --> 29:13.900]  If I'm going to smoke in the morning, I like to have something a little lighter if that's available.
[29:13.900 --> 29:21.900]  Jilly bean is a great breakfast dab. I don't want to smoke something like Jack Harer or Jack the Ripper first thing in the morning.
[29:21.900 --> 29:25.900]  That's going to just kind of fuck up my whole flow. I'm going to be off kilter all day.
[29:25.900 --> 29:30.900]  I may be a little anxious because when you get that high in the morning, I feel like I fuck stuff up.
[29:30.900 --> 29:34.900]  I'll leave something at home or I'll leave something on and leave and go all the way to work.
[29:34.900 --> 29:38.900]  You'll do that thing where you put the gas pump in the car and drive away with the pump in the car.
[29:38.900 --> 29:43.900]  I've never done that, but that's the kind of shit I feel like I could do if I smoke too strong of a sativa in the morning.
[29:43.900 --> 29:48.900]  I got to get my head on straight. I like to start off with that orangey terp. That's where I was.
[29:48.900 --> 29:53.900]  I just talked myself back to where I was because I fucking lost track of where I was, but I found it, you guys, so you can't make fun of me.
[29:53.900 --> 29:56.900]  But those orangey terps are always like mellow and uplifting and a smile.
[29:56.900 --> 30:01.900]  They always make me kind of smile, put me in a good mood. That's always what I've noticed from orangey terps.
[30:01.900 --> 30:07.900]  Lemon terps, it makes my head spin and it makes me motivated and it makes me talkative.
[30:07.900 --> 30:14.900]  Before I do these podcasts, I like to smoke heavy sativa dominant lemon flavored dabs.
[30:14.900 --> 30:18.900]  They get right to my head. Today I'm smoking Cascade, which is bred by me.
[30:18.900 --> 30:26.900]  This is a lemon skunk female that was pollinated by a Daybreaker male and I am using phenotype, which was known as B1.
[30:26.900 --> 30:32.900]  It's the really lemony, it smells like dish soap. Honestly, you guys, this is why I named it Cascade.
[30:32.900 --> 30:38.900]  Cascade, the feeling of something coming over you, like the waterfall of this feeling that happens when you dab it.
[30:38.900 --> 30:42.900]  It's the Cascade. And then it also smells like lemon dish soap, which is Cascade.
[30:42.900 --> 30:47.900]  So I called it Cascade. You can tell it makes me talkative and rambly.
[30:47.900 --> 30:52.900]  It's my version of Alpha Brain. Joe Rogan takes 17 Alpha Brain before a podcast.
[30:52.900 --> 30:58.900]  I smoke six dabs of Cascade. So I really feel like these lemon terps keep me in a good mood.
[30:58.900 --> 31:04.900]  I do battle some... My brain is mad at me. You guys, I hit my head a long time ago and my mood swings a little bit.
[31:04.900 --> 31:09.900]  I'll get pissy sometimes. Take a few Cascade dabs, I forget what I was mad about.
[31:09.900 --> 31:13.900]  So I feel like the high sativa, the lemon terps work well for my body type.
[31:13.900 --> 31:21.900]  Another thing that I'm going to say that supports my statement, this may sound racist, but it's not racist.
[31:21.900 --> 31:25.900]  This is a geographical thing that I feel like I have discovered.
[31:25.900 --> 31:30.900]  Where I live, we have a high population of Mexican and Hispanic heritage people.
[31:30.900 --> 31:35.900]  A lot of people here have people, bloodlines straight to Mexico.
[31:35.900 --> 31:40.900]  One of the most popular strains to ever come around where I live... You guys, I live in Pueblo, Colorado.
[31:40.900 --> 31:45.900]  This is Southern Colorado. Very, very heavily Mexican populated.
[31:45.900 --> 31:53.900]  A long time ago, we got some sour diesel here and it has not gone away since then because the Mexican people here love sour diesel.
[31:53.900 --> 32:03.900]  If you smell that sour diesel smell down the block, if you burn some sour diesel, a Mexican heritage person will ask you for some sour diesel.
[32:03.900 --> 32:08.900]  You guys, in 2017, I don't fucking know if it's racist to call somebody a Mexican.
[32:08.900 --> 32:14.900]  I think people that have, that were their families from Mexico and they got Mexican blood in them, that is a Mexican person to me.
[32:14.900 --> 32:18.900]  I'm not trying to be racist. I don't know the other word. If there's a better word I should be using, fucking tell me, I'll use it.
[32:18.900 --> 32:24.900]  Also, I need to make a correction. Earlier I said, pheromones of somebody from the opposite sex could get your attention.
[32:24.900 --> 32:28.900]  It's also 2017. Pheromones from fucking anybody could get your attention.
[32:28.900 --> 32:34.900]  Now, I apologize if that was offensive as well. I'm going to try to be more sensitive to that sort of thing without overdoing it.
[32:35.900 --> 32:39.900]  But it could be the same sex. Go for it. It's 2017.
[32:39.900 --> 32:41.900]  I'm trying not to be racist with the Mexican word.
[32:41.900 --> 32:45.900]  So, I've noticed that the Mexican people around here love to smoke sour diesel.
[32:45.900 --> 32:51.900]  My theory, I could be wrong here. This is Rasta Jeff's theory. Once again, I'm not a scientist. I'm not a doctor.
[32:51.900 --> 32:54.900]  I've just been doing this for a minute.
[32:54.900 --> 32:58.900]  The Mexican people here love sour diesel almost more than any other strain.
[32:58.900 --> 33:05.900]  I feel like Mexican, that sour diesel is a chem dog crossed to a Mexican sativa.
[33:05.900 --> 33:11.900]  That's what I feel like. Or there is a heavy Mexican sativa genetic in the cannabis.
[33:11.900 --> 33:21.900]  I feel like that Mexican sativa is what causes that skunky smell, that real skunk, funk, pungent odor that almost tends to lean to the diesel.
[33:21.900 --> 33:24.900]  I think that is a Mexican sativa.
[33:24.900 --> 33:31.900]  I think that since that Mexican sativa plant and the Mexican people come from the same spot on the planet,
[33:31.900 --> 33:41.900]  they are getting a stronger benefit and a stronger desire for that plant because it's geographically from where they're from in their body, their history.
[33:41.900 --> 33:50.900]  They know that. Something about where they are, something in that sour diesel plant is going to benefit their life because of their environment.
[33:51.900 --> 33:56.900]  It's just something in their body chemistry. It's something in their genetics. It's something that's pre-programmed in their memory.
[33:56.900 --> 34:02.900]  I don't know how to back it up with science or anything. This is just my opinion and my theory.
[34:02.900 --> 34:13.900]  My whole point here is that I feel like your body, your nose, your mouth, your senses are probably the best judge of what cannabis is best for you.
[34:14.900 --> 34:25.900]  I do respect the lab tests. I completely appreciate the idea of a lab test, but please do not let that lab test ruin your idea of a certain strain.
[34:25.900 --> 34:33.900]  If a strain gets your attention, if you have two strains sitting next to each other and you have a lab test for both of them and you can smell both of them,
[34:33.900 --> 34:37.900]  if one has great lab tests and one smells better, get the one that smells better.
[34:37.900 --> 34:42.900]  If it's properly trimmed and cured and grown properly, if they're both top shelf buds, get the one that smells better.
[34:42.900 --> 34:45.900]  I can almost guarantee you're going to have more pleasure from it.
[34:45.900 --> 34:52.900]  Also, something I want to add to this 30-minute rant about selecting your cannabis strains via your nose instead of your lab test,
[34:52.900 --> 34:58.900]  don't discredit a strain because you've tried it once from one grower.
[34:58.900 --> 35:03.900]  I hear people say, oh, I hate whatever strain. I don't like this strain. This strain is fire.
[35:04.900 --> 35:13.900]  You guys, the quality of a flower you purchase can vary widely on the same strain for very many reasons.
[35:13.900 --> 35:17.900]  I'm sorry. I'm trying to get this all through my brain and to you clearly. I don't have any notes on this part.
[35:17.900 --> 35:26.900]  If I grow some flowers and Jesse grows some flowers and my girl Jenny grows some flowers, they're all three going to come out different.
[35:26.900 --> 35:34.900]  I grow with botanic care nutrients indoors. Jesse grows with organic nutrients in a light-depth greenhouse.
[35:34.900 --> 35:39.900]  Jenny doesn't grow. That's hypothetical. We're going to say she grows in a tent with synthetic newts.
[35:39.900 --> 35:43.900]  All of our stuff is going to come out different. We may have a clone of the same thing.
[35:43.900 --> 35:48.900]  It's going to come out a little bit different. The lab testing will be different. The flavors will be different.
[35:48.900 --> 35:52.900]  The terpene profile will be different. The cannabinoid profile will be a little bit different.
[35:53.900 --> 36:01.900]  It's going to come out differently because of the different environments. There'll be different phenotypical expressions, which also leads me to something else.
[36:01.900 --> 36:07.900]  Maybe somebody selected a shitty phenotype of that strain for you.
[36:07.900 --> 36:15.900]  Maybe they got a 10-pack of seeds and they chose the one that grows short and stout, and you would have preferred the one that grows tall and skinny, but that's not what they wanted.
[36:15.900 --> 36:23.900]  You didn't get a good representation of that plant. Don't discredit something just because you didn't like it the first time.
[36:23.900 --> 36:27.900]  If Jenny grew it, it's different. If Jesse grew it, it's different. If I grew it, it's different.
[36:27.900 --> 36:31.900]  You may like Jenny's style better. You may like Jesse's better. You may like mine better.
[36:31.900 --> 36:38.900]  Give a strain a couple of tries. If it gives you a headache or a panic attack or something like that, I could see why you'd avoid it.
[36:38.900 --> 36:46.900]  Maybe not go for it a second try, but if you just didn't like it for some weird reason, give it another shot. You may be discrediting yourself on something weird.
[36:46.900 --> 36:51.900]  Focus more on the effects of the cannabis, how much it draws you.
[36:51.900 --> 36:58.900]  The lab tests are great. What I really like a lab test for is now they are showing pesticides and stuff like that. That's what I like to see.
[36:58.900 --> 37:07.900]  In my concentrates, I can see how many residual solvents are in my dabs. I can see how much pesticide is in my dabs. I like being able to see that kind of stuff.
[37:07.900 --> 37:12.900]  I really like seeing it when things test really high. Sometimes it's questionable.
[37:12.900 --> 37:21.900]  We're going to talk in the future about actual lab test numbers because people see THC and THCA and they're not sure which ones to brag about on the testing.
[37:21.900 --> 37:24.900]  We're going to talk about that a little bit in the future.
[37:24.900 --> 37:34.900]  One more note that I added to this that I want to make sure I cover before I move on from the lab test versus your senses is that the labs are all calibrated the same.
[37:34.900 --> 37:40.900]  All of those machines have the same base and the same what I don't know what the same standard is what it's called.
[37:40.900 --> 37:44.900]  They ran the same THC through that machine to set a standard for all of them.
[37:44.900 --> 37:49.900]  They're all calibrated. Our bodies are not calibrated the exact same.
[37:49.900 --> 37:54.900]  There will be differences. Our body chemistry is going to play a huge role in what cannabis works for you.
[37:54.900 --> 38:03.900]  The lab tests are great, but your body chemistry, your nose, your eyes, your mouth, hopefully your ears aren't involved too much in selecting your cannabis unless you heard of a killer strain.
[38:04.900 --> 38:09.900]  But how you feel, all of that stuff should be a huge decision maker for your cannabis.
[38:09.900 --> 38:13.900]  Trust in the tests, read all those tests, find out what kind of pesticides are in there.
[38:13.900 --> 38:15.900]  And then maybe here's a good tip.
[38:15.900 --> 38:23.900]  If you find some strains that you like and you can find lab testing on all of them that is slightly consistent, find what is common.
[38:23.900 --> 38:29.900]  Find the common thread through those tests and then maybe you can start looking for more strains like that.
[38:29.900 --> 38:35.900]  And in the future, I believe that we're going to have tailor-made cannabis dosing.
[38:35.900 --> 38:47.900]  You'll be able to go get a tailor-made, the perfect amount of terps, the perfect amount of cannabinoids, the right amount of each cannabinoid, however you want it, whatever ratios you want.
[38:47.900 --> 38:53.900]  You'll be able to get a pill probably made for yourself that you can swallow and it is your perfect cannabis medicine.
[38:53.900 --> 38:55.900]  So start looking now at those lab tests.
[38:56.900 --> 38:57.900]  Find the little chart that works for you.
[38:57.900 --> 39:01.900]  Find all those common threads and you'll be ahead of the game when that time comes.
[39:01.900 --> 39:02.900]  Okay.
[39:02.900 --> 39:08.900]  Just a few seconds ago, I was talking about strains that give me panic attacks in the morning and strains that I like to smoke at certain times of the day.
[39:08.900 --> 39:14.900]  When I was outlining this episode, I decided to make a short list of strains that work well.
[39:14.900 --> 39:16.900]  I call them low panic strains.
[39:16.900 --> 39:21.900]  I've got jilly bean written down as a low panic strain, you guys.
[39:21.900 --> 39:24.900]  Tangerine haze is a low panic strain.
[39:24.900 --> 39:26.900]  Tangy is a low panic strain.
[39:26.900 --> 39:31.900]  In my opinion, these are things in my opinion that do not cause panic and anxiety.
[39:31.900 --> 39:37.900]  Those are sativa kind of strains that put a smile on my face and put a little pep in my step.
[39:37.900 --> 39:42.900]  If you got to do dishes, if you have to vacuum the house, these are the perfect strains for that.
[39:42.900 --> 39:47.900]  They keep you moving and they don't seem to mess up my focus and ruin my plans for the day.
[39:47.900 --> 39:53.900]  Sometimes if I smoke something too sativa heavy first thing in the morning, like I said, a big fat joint of lemon jeffery first thing in the morning,
[39:53.900 --> 39:55.900]  I might not get the right things done.
[39:55.900 --> 39:59.900]  I'll get some shit done, but it will not be what was on the to-do list at all.
[39:59.900 --> 40:02.900]  Something will get cleaned that did not need to be cleaned.
[40:02.900 --> 40:03.900]  Stuff like that will happen.
[40:03.900 --> 40:07.900]  Stuff with the orange turps I think are great for the morning.
[40:07.900 --> 40:09.900]  Things to avoid if you get panicky.
[40:09.900 --> 40:11.900]  Strains I would stay away from.
[40:11.900 --> 40:16.900]  Jack the Ripper, way too sativa dominant for your head first thing in the morning.
[40:16.900 --> 40:20.900]  Vortex, Space Queen, way too much for your head first thing in the morning.
[40:21.900 --> 40:24.900]  Sour Diesel, way too much for most people first thing in the morning.
[40:24.900 --> 40:30.900]  So if you get panicky, stay away from the Sour Diesel, the Vortex, the Jack the Ripper, the Space Queen.
[40:30.900 --> 40:32.900]  Stay away from that sort of stuff.
[40:32.900 --> 40:39.900]  If you want the giggles, something that is often given a lot of people the giggles is the LA Confidential.
[40:39.900 --> 40:44.900]  If you can find a really indica dominant LA Confidential, smoke on that and get the giggles.
[40:44.900 --> 40:50.900]  I smoked some CBN Shatter a few days ago with a couple friends of mine.
[40:50.900 --> 40:56.900]  If you can find products that are high in CBN, you will get the munchies.
[40:56.900 --> 41:01.900]  I took that dab and by the time I was done blowing the dab out, I wanted to eat the rig and the dabber.
[41:01.900 --> 41:03.900]  I wanted to eat everything in sight.
[41:03.900 --> 41:05.900]  So CBN is good if you're trying to get hungry.
[41:05.900 --> 41:08.900]  I'm just trying to think of things that will help you guys out for specific strains and stuff, you guys.
[41:09.900 --> 41:15.900]  If you're looking for very specific CBD strains, I can recommend Torobora, ACDC, and Pennywise.
[41:15.900 --> 41:19.900]  A lot of people are looking for CBD dominant strains right now.
[41:19.900 --> 41:24.900]  Something that I like to talk about is the Night Nurse and I also like Kings Cure.
[41:24.900 --> 41:27.900]  Kings Cure is available in seed form. Night Nurse is sold out.
[41:27.900 --> 41:30.900]  You might be able to find Kings Cure in a few places.
[41:30.900 --> 41:32.900]  Grab those if you can.
[41:32.900 --> 41:35.900]  There are some great CBD phenotypes in there.
[41:35.900 --> 41:39.900]  One thing I should mention, if people are thinking about starting to use medical marijuana,
[41:39.900 --> 41:41.900]  first of all, start very slowly.
[41:41.900 --> 41:45.900]  If you're going to smoke, I suggest starting off with flowers.
[41:45.900 --> 41:54.900]  Start off with a pipe with some flowers in it or a joint and take one or two medium-sized puffs or draws or inhalations.
[41:54.900 --> 41:57.900]  Don't smoke. Don't pull it in until you feel like your lungs are swelling up.
[41:57.900 --> 41:59.900]  Just get enough smoke in there. Blow it out.
[41:59.900 --> 42:02.900]  Do that once or twice. You're going to feel it very quickly.
[42:02.900 --> 42:04.900]  You're not going to freak out. You'll be just fine.
[42:04.900 --> 42:06.900]  Nobody's ever died from cannabis. You're going to be okay.
[42:06.900 --> 42:10.900]  If you're really scared that you're going to have a shitty high and you're worried about it,
[42:10.900 --> 42:13.900]  make yourself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich or whatever.
[42:13.900 --> 42:16.900]  Just have some food ready is what I'm saying.
[42:16.900 --> 42:20.900]  Peanut butter and jelly sandwich is perfect. Everyone's got that, but you might not be able to eat that.
[42:20.900 --> 42:24.900]  Have something ready that you can just snack on and be in a cool environment.
[42:24.900 --> 42:26.900]  Take a couple puffs.
[42:26.900 --> 42:28.900]  If it goes wrong, eat your food.
[42:28.900 --> 42:30.900]  Wait an hour or two. You'll be just fine.
[42:31.900 --> 42:36.900]  Where I'm headed with this is if you're new to medical marijuana and you're thinking about trying medical marijuana,
[42:36.900 --> 42:38.900]  this is something I think you should think about.
[42:38.900 --> 42:40.900]  Cannabis is a very smart plant.
[42:40.900 --> 42:46.900]  Cannabis has been here for a long time, and I'm sure that it was given to us for a medicinal purpose,
[42:46.900 --> 42:53.900]  which lets me think that if you have some pain or an ailment that you're trying to medicate through cannabis,
[42:53.900 --> 42:58.900]  cannabis will target that ailment before it will cause intoxication.
[42:58.900 --> 43:01.900]  Let's say you've got a broken part. I'm going to say my knee.
[43:01.900 --> 43:04.900]  My left knee swells up by the end of the day if I don't do something about it.
[43:04.900 --> 43:09.900]  My left knee hurts if I work hard, if I'm squatting up and down, carrying shit.
[43:09.900 --> 43:12.900]  My left knee will start to throb. It'll hurt a little bit.
[43:12.900 --> 43:14.900]  I'll take a few dabs.
[43:14.900 --> 43:18.900]  First two dabs, I don't get high from it, but I can feel my knee.
[43:18.900 --> 43:23.900]  The first dab, the constant pain, the like the, oh, that goes away.
[43:23.900 --> 43:25.900]  One dab.
[43:25.900 --> 43:27.900]  Now I can relax.
[43:27.900 --> 43:32.900]  I'm still at the point where if I put pressure on it and try to lift up something and walk up some stairs, it hurts.
[43:32.900 --> 43:34.900]  So dab number two removes that.
[43:34.900 --> 43:39.900]  Now I'm at level. I'm pain-free at sit still, and I'm pain-free at work mode.
[43:39.900 --> 43:40.900]  I'm pain-free now.
[43:40.900 --> 43:43.900]  My next dab kind of makes me feel high.
[43:43.900 --> 43:45.900]  Now I'm getting to recreational dabs.
[43:45.900 --> 43:47.900]  My third dab, now I'm just high.
[43:47.900 --> 43:49.900]  Or my fourth dab, sorry, now I can't even count.
[43:49.900 --> 43:51.900]  Fourth dab, now I'm just high. I'm trying to get fucked up having fun.
[43:52.900 --> 43:58.900]  So I believe that cannabis and cannabinoids know how to go target that pain and deal with that pain.
[43:58.900 --> 44:03.900]  So if you are legitimately, and I feel the same thing works with opiates or other pills.
[44:03.900 --> 44:11.900]  If you break your knee and you go to the doctor and they give you Vicodin, they're probably going to give you something better than Vicodin, but I don't know about pharmaceuticals because I don't fuck with them.
[44:11.900 --> 44:14.900]  If you break your knee and you go to the doctor, they're going to give you pills.
[44:14.900 --> 44:17.900]  If you have something broken, you're not going to get high as fuck off those pills.
[44:17.900 --> 44:20.900]  If you take the recommended dosage, it's going to go to your knee.
[44:20.900 --> 44:27.900]  If you're not broken and you take those pills, you're probably going to get high and feel like shit from them because you don't have any pain to deal with.
[44:27.900 --> 44:29.900]  And I think cannabis knows that is what I'm getting at.
[44:29.900 --> 44:32.900]  So if you're afraid of cannabis, that is my encouragement.
[44:32.900 --> 44:35.900]  Cannabis is very smart. Cannabis is very gentle.
[44:35.900 --> 44:37.900]  Cannabis wants to be your friend.
[44:37.900 --> 44:40.900]  I have consumed a lot of things in my life.
[44:40.900 --> 44:42.900]  Some things were not my friend.
[44:42.900 --> 44:45.900]  Some things made me feel like shit.
[44:45.900 --> 44:47.900]  Some things made me see the devil.
[44:47.900 --> 44:50.900]  Cannabis has always been my friend in every situation.
[44:50.900 --> 44:56.900]  If I was sick, if I was well, if I was bummed out, if I was happy, cannabis has always been my buddy.
[44:56.900 --> 45:04.900]  So if you're thinking about trying cannabis or if you've got somebody in your life that you want to encourage to use cannabis, give them a pep talk that cannabis knows where to go hit the pain.
[45:04.900 --> 45:10.900]  And if you've got pain and you've got a problem, you're not going to get too fucked up right away because cannabis wants to solve that problem first.
[45:10.900 --> 45:13.900]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, somebody asked for longer episodes.
[45:13.900 --> 45:16.900]  It's been 45 minutes. It's hard to go a full hour by myself.
[45:16.900 --> 45:18.900]  I feel like I'm just rambling out here.
[45:18.900 --> 45:20.900]  I hope you enjoyed this 45 minute solo episode.
[45:20.900 --> 45:23.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to give a huge shout out to my friends at Handmade Apparel.

[48:24.900 --> 48:25.900]  Three words to the party.
[48:25.900 --> 48:29.240]  Smoke, I can make my pay.
[48:29.240 --> 48:30.240]  Selling light green kush.
[48:30.240 --> 48:33.240]  Pound for pound is the old school sound I'm throwing down.
[48:33.240 --> 48:35.240]  I'm a smoker and a dealer.
[48:35.240 --> 48:37.240]  See, I got a sling to my best ability.
[48:37.240 --> 48:39.240]  I got the kush that'll knock you down.
[48:39.240 --> 48:41.240]  I like the blunt, then I pass it around.
[48:41.240 --> 48:42.240]  Let me know.
[48:42.240 --> 48:51.800]  Throw your head back and scream, oh yeah, because I am Afro man.
[48:51.800 --> 48:53.800]  Selling weed straight from Afghanistan.
[48:53.800 --> 48:54.800]  So light it up.
[48:54.800 --> 48:56.800]  Pass it around when you need some more.
[48:56.800 --> 49:05.800]  I'll be around, be around, be around, be around, be around, be around, be around.
[49:05.800 --> 49:54.660]  Selling weed in Europe, Africa, Amsterdam, and Japan.
[49:54.660 --> 49:57.660]  If you want the best, buy from the West.
[49:57.660 --> 49:59.660]  Hit this and you'll agree.
[49:59.660 --> 50:03.660]  When you're in need of some bomb ass weed, you'll spend big money with me, you see.
[50:03.660 --> 50:07.660]  Because when I was a little baby boy, big chronic punks, I did enjoy.
[50:07.660 --> 50:11.660]  Digital and hand scales, blowjobs in between cells
[50:11.660 --> 50:15.660]  Getting rich from God's creation like the real Rick Ross I'm surfin' nation
[50:15.660 --> 50:19.660]  I made up my mind just what to do and I started up a hungry hustle group
[50:19.660 --> 50:23.660]  Go crazy, go crazy, smoke till your vision is hazy
[50:23.660 --> 50:43.610]  Beats in your ears, burgundy outfit, drinkin' cotton mouth, quenching Code 45
[50:43.610 --> 50:47.610]  If you don't know how to smoke, get ready to learn, cause Afro's taking his turn to burn
[50:47.610 --> 50:51.610]  Take a eighth, a quarter, a ounce, money up front so I can bounce
[50:51.610 --> 50:55.610]  Take a pound, take it out of town, catch in my hand, it's Afro Man
[50:55.610 --> 50:59.610]  I got the beat, got the swish to sweep, without me smoking it's incomplete
[50:59.610 --> 51:03.610]  Like this yo, like that yo, like my women, I like my blunts fat ho
[51:03.610 --> 51:07.610]  Smoke this, smoke that, my blunts are fat, Afro Man got weed like that
[51:07.610 --> 51:11.610]  Everybody in the street smokin' on my sack, havin' THC, asthma attack
[51:11.610 --> 51:15.610]  Buy a ounce yo, buy a pound, while you listen to the rhythm of the Reaper sound
[51:15.610 --> 51:19.610]  Slingin' zip for zip, like a crazy dream, in the American dream, inhalin' vaporous steam
[51:19.610 --> 51:23.610]  Smoke on it, smoke on it, smoke and smoke and choke on it
[51:23.610 --> 51:27.610]  We turn the blunts, blunts turn to roach and you hit it till nobody want it
[51:27.610 --> 51:31.610]  Smoke on it, smoke on it, smoke and smoke and choke on it
[51:31.610 --> 51:35.610]  We turn the blunts, blunts turn to roach and you hit it till nobody want it
[51:35.610 --> 51:39.610]  Cause smoking weed is what I do best, yes yes princess I'm from the west
[51:39.610 --> 51:43.610]  If you don't think Afro Man's for real, let me tell you what happened to the man of steel
[51:43.610 --> 51:47.610]  Super Man came to town to see what he could sell
[51:47.610 --> 51:51.610]  He stacked his mail high as hell until he re-armed hell
[51:51.610 --> 51:55.610]  His pounds were stacked three stories high, his bong was made of steel
[51:55.610 --> 51:59.610]  I said Afro Man run this land, he said boy be for real
[51:59.610 --> 52:03.610]  He's out faster than the sheriff department, if they was smokin' crack
[52:03.610 --> 52:07.610]  Exhale my super breath, and give the whole world contact
[52:07.610 --> 52:11.610]  I can fly my pounds around the world without catching no heat
[52:11.610 --> 52:15.610]  I socialize with x-ray eyes and a grape swish of sweet
[52:15.610 --> 52:19.610]  He opened up his zip lock bag and the vapors begin to smell
[52:19.610 --> 52:23.610]  And all the potheads started sniffing, wandering through the dell
[52:23.610 --> 52:27.610]  And just when he had sold a pound and thought his weed was right
[52:27.610 --> 52:31.610]  I invented a sack and took the town back with Palmdale Kryptonite
[52:31.610 --> 52:35.610]  That's right, Super Man said yes indeed, this is that Palmdale Kryptonite
[52:35.610 --> 52:39.610]  I said now that you know the deal, bring all your dollar bills to my coop to bid
[52:39.610 --> 52:43.610]  I'm Afro Man from East Palmdale, I got that Kryptonite for sale
[52:43.610 --> 52:47.610]  I do it right, cause I can't do it wrong, that's why the whole world wanna hit my butt
[52:47.610 --> 52:51.610]  Smoke on it, smoke on it, smoke and smoke and choke on it
[52:51.610 --> 52:55.610]  We turn the blood, blood turn the roach and you hit it till don't nobody want it
[52:55.610 --> 52:59.610]  Smoke on it, smoke on it, smoke and smoke and choke on it
[52:59.610 --> 53:03.610]  We turn the blood, blood turn the roach and you hit it till don't nobody want it
[53:03.610 --> 53:07.610]  We turn the blood, blood turn the roach and you hit it till don't nobody want it
[53:07.610 --> 53:11.610]  Smoke on it, smoke on it, smoke and smoke and choke on it
[53:11.610 --> 53:36.210]  We turn the blood, blood turn the roach and you hit it till don't nobody want it
[53:54.210 --> 53:58.210]  This my friends is the podcast for you
[53:58.210 --> 54:02.210]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, I wanna thank you guys again for joining me
[54:02.210 --> 54:06.210]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band for letting me use their music on my podcast

[54:10.210 --> 54:14.210]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am coming to you on a frosty, cold Colorado evening

[55:26.210 --> 55:30.210]  Our friend Bobo Blastrico and Lindsey stopped by this afternoon, they came and had a little mini afternoon sesh with me today
[55:30.210 --> 55:34.210]  And while they were here, Bobo mentioned that he was just wearing that hoodie
[55:34.210 --> 55:38.210]  And he did not have on a heavy jacket or anything, and he said he was nice and warm and cozy
[55:38.210 --> 55:42.210]  And ladies and gentlemen, it was fucking cold and nasty out there today
[55:42.210 --> 55:46.210]  So those hoodies are super cozy, these hoodies are nice and warm, I feel all snuggly in it

[55:50.210 --> 55:54.210]  Send me an email, that was hard to say, growfromyourhearthotmail.com
[55:54.210 --> 55:58.210]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to get through that ad and then I'm going to shift directions here
[55:58.210 --> 56:02.210]  I've got some terrible news, I'm going to turn on the music for this part
[56:02.210 --> 56:06.210]  I want to have just a very, it's a podcast so I can't do too long of a moment of silence
[56:06.210 --> 56:10.210]  But I'm going to take a very brief moment of silence for a very important member of the cannabis community that we have lost
[56:10.210 --> 56:14.210]  There is a seed company known as the Greenhouse Seed Company
[56:14.210 --> 56:18.210]  They were one of the very first and largest seed companies and coffee shops in Amsterdam
[56:18.210 --> 56:22.210]  Greenhouse Seed Company is founded and mostly led by a man by the name of Arjen Roskam
[56:22.210 --> 56:26.210]  Who was a great man, he's a cannabis breeder, he's a chef, he's a traveler
[56:26.210 --> 56:30.210]  Arjen's partner in crime, his best friend, his cohort, his cannabis compadre
[56:30.210 --> 56:34.210]  Was a young man by the name of Franco
[56:34.210 --> 56:38.210]  Unfortunately, I hate to report that Franco was one of the first people to die
[56:38.210 --> 56:42.210]  Of cannabis poisoning, he was a young man, he was a cannabis breeder
[56:42.210 --> 56:46.210]  Unfortunately, I hate to report that Franco unfortunately passed away
[56:46.210 --> 56:50.210]  Franco contracted malaria while in the Congo
[56:50.210 --> 56:54.210]  Franco was in the Congo, in the jungle of the Congo
[56:54.210 --> 56:58.210]  Trying to do research and get CBD
[56:58.210 --> 57:02.210]  To people who have contracted malaria
[57:02.210 --> 57:06.210]  He was there trying to get CBD medicine to folks who contracted malaria
[57:06.210 --> 57:10.210]  And he got cerebral malaria himself and he passed from the malaria
[57:10.210 --> 57:14.210]  I'm going to take a very brief moment of silence here
[57:14.210 --> 57:18.210]  This blink of silence is for Franco
[57:18.210 --> 57:23.930]  Much respect to Franco, Franco was a strain hunter
[57:23.930 --> 57:27.930]  Franco was a ganja farmer, Franco was a wonderful man
[57:27.930 --> 57:31.930]  He was a great dude, he had great energy
[57:31.930 --> 57:35.930]  If you go to, I think it's just Franco Strain Hunter on Instagram
[57:35.930 --> 57:39.930]  If you look at all of his pictures, he always has a smile, he's always hugging somebody
[57:39.930 --> 57:43.930]  He has a cannabis plant in every single one of his pictures
[57:43.930 --> 57:47.930]  Franco loved strain hunting, Franco loved traveling the world in search of the best cannabis
[57:47.930 --> 57:51.930]  You can find a lot of video footage of Franco on the Strain Hunter video series
[57:51.930 --> 57:55.930]  From Greenhouse Seeds, when you watch those videos you will see Franco's passion for cannabis
[57:55.930 --> 57:59.930]  And you will see the friendship between Simon and Franco and Arjen
[57:59.930 --> 58:03.930]  It's a magical friendship and it is a huge loss to the cannabis community
[58:03.930 --> 58:07.930]  To lose a man like Franco
[58:07.930 --> 58:11.930]  The only thing I can do to make myself feel better and maybe this will make you feel better too
[58:11.930 --> 58:15.930]  Is we lost a whole bunch of notable musicians, actors, comedians
[58:15.930 --> 58:19.930]  And notable folks in the past few years
[58:19.930 --> 58:23.930]  And now wherever those people have congregated, wherever you believe people go when they pass
[58:23.930 --> 58:27.930]  Now they've got a quality ganja farmer growing ganja for them
[58:27.930 --> 58:31.930]  So when you and I get to the great gig in the sky, Franco will be there with a fat one rolled waiting for us
[58:31.930 --> 58:35.930]  And a big ol' hug, he'll be there to greet you
[58:35.930 --> 58:39.930]  Big hug to Franco, big hug and much respect to the entire Greenhouse Seeds family
[58:39.930 --> 58:43.930]  And also big hug to everybody who was touched by Franco and has a tear in their eye because of this news
[58:43.930 --> 58:47.930]  Alright you guys, I'm going to try to shift gears
[58:47.930 --> 58:51.930]  And we're going to do a product review
[58:51.930 --> 58:55.930]  I quite often ask if people would like to have a product reviewed, all they need to do is send me an email
[58:55.930 --> 58:59.930]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com and I can teach you how to get your product in my hands
[58:59.930 --> 59:03.930]  And I will review it here on the show for you
[59:03.930 --> 59:07.930]  Alright, the product for review today is a grinder
[59:07.930 --> 59:11.930]  This was sent to me by Chop Shop Grinders
[59:11.930 --> 59:15.930]  This is a nice grinder, it's got a nice black shine to it
[59:15.930 --> 59:19.930]  It's got the Chop Shop Grinders logo on the top
[59:19.930 --> 59:23.930]  It is very similar to most grinders
[59:23.930 --> 59:27.930]  It has a top piece that you lift open, you put your flour product in here
[59:27.930 --> 59:31.930]  You put the lid back on, you give it a good spin
[59:31.930 --> 59:35.930]  You put your mesh screen in here, this is where your ground flour ends up
[59:35.930 --> 59:39.930]  It says to grind it coarse, to leave it one direction
[59:39.930 --> 59:43.930]  For a fine grind, to flip it upside down and grind it that way for a finer grind
[59:43.930 --> 59:47.930]  And then of course it's got this little screen here
[59:47.930 --> 59:51.930]  To where on the bottom you can actually catch the keef
[59:51.930 --> 59:55.930]  If you're a keef catching kind of guy, you can put that in your bowls or you can put that on your joints
[59:55.930 --> 59:59.930]  Or you can do whatever you want with your keef, there's a lot of uses for it
[59:59.930 --> 01:00:03.930]  This is called a pollen catch, is what this portion of the grinder is
[01:00:03.930 --> 01:00:07.930]  But keef is not pollen, people that call keef pollen, you are wrong
[01:00:07.930 --> 01:00:11.930]  Pollen comes from male plants
[01:00:11.930 --> 01:00:15.930]  There is no pollen in your female plants unless something went horribly wrong
[01:00:15.930 --> 01:00:19.930]  So you are not catching pollen, that is keef
[01:00:19.930 --> 01:00:23.930]  Those are mainly trichomes that you were gathering on the bottom there
[01:00:23.930 --> 01:00:27.930]  You can gather those up and put them on a bowl or you can put them in a joint
[01:00:27.930 --> 01:00:31.930]  If you're going to wrap a little bit of wax around a joint, you can also put that keef
[01:00:31.930 --> 01:00:35.930]  On the outside of the wax, it is very potent
[01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:39.930]  That's basically trichomes that have fallen off of your buds, but it is not pollen
[01:00:39.930 --> 01:00:43.930]  So please quit calling that pollen
[01:00:43.930 --> 01:00:47.930]  One thing I do like about this grinder is it is super light
[01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:51.930]  I've got another grinder that I carry in my backpack, it is really heavy
[01:00:51.930 --> 01:00:55.930]  This one has replaced the backpack grinder
[01:00:55.930 --> 01:00:59.930]  The problem with this grinder is it gets stuck a lot
[01:00:59.930 --> 01:01:03.930]  Once you get some material in there, they start getting a little sticky, they don't want to turn
[01:01:03.930 --> 01:01:07.930]  This one has little, I want to call them finger indentions
[01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:11.930]  They are just little grippies for your fingers, where it is not going to get stuck
[01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:15.930]  I know that I will always be able to spin this grinder because of the little finger grippies on here
[01:01:15.930 --> 01:01:19.930]  My sharpstone grinder, it got stuck, it is still stuck, fuck it, I'm never going to get it undone
[01:01:19.930 --> 01:01:23.930]  I'm not going to try, now I've got a chop shop grinder to use
[01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:27.930]  I'm going to put a couple of flowers in here and we are going to smoke a joint together
[01:01:27.930 --> 01:01:31.930]  Before I do that, I've already got one tiny complaint about this grinder
[01:01:31.930 --> 01:01:35.930]  The only complaint I have is that it is too small
[01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:39.930]  This thing is probably 3 inches in diameter
[01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:43.930]  I've got two nuggets sitting here that I plan on rolling into one joint
[01:01:43.930 --> 01:01:47.930]  I'm going to have to grind both of my buds separately because they will not fit in this grinder
[01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:51.930]  That may not be everybody's problem
[01:01:51.930 --> 01:01:55.930]  Everybody may not have giant buds or too much weed for their grinder
[01:01:55.930 --> 01:01:59.930]  For a guy like myself, I'm going to have to run this grinder twice
[01:01:59.930 --> 01:02:03.930]  Just to get these buds ground up
[01:02:03.930 --> 01:02:07.930]  There is a stem in the middle I'm taking out
[01:02:07.930 --> 01:02:11.930]  The top portion is pretty full, I'm putting the little lid on
[01:02:11.930 --> 01:02:15.930]  I'm going to give it a grind into the mic so you can hear it
[01:02:15.930 --> 01:02:19.930]  That's all it took, this weed is pretty much ground up, ready to roll into a joint
[01:02:19.930 --> 01:02:23.930]  I'm going to give it a couple more twists, I'm going to take the top off
[01:02:23.930 --> 01:02:27.930]  Now I'm going to put the other nug in here, I'm going to give it a little pre-break
[01:02:27.930 --> 01:02:31.930]  What I'm grinding up is called Burning Spear, this is Girl Scout Cookies
[01:02:31.930 --> 01:02:35.930]  The Forum Cut of Girl Scout Cookies pollinated by a reversed Grateful Dog
[01:02:35.930 --> 01:02:39.930]  So it's Forum Cookies to Grateful Dog
[01:02:39.930 --> 01:02:43.930]  This was a Femini seed that I grew, I did not put these seeds out to the market
[01:02:43.930 --> 01:02:47.930]  I gave a few of them to Spence from the Garden of Weeden for his birthday one year
[01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:51.930]  He is the only one that got seeds, I'm pretty sure he gifted a couple of those
[01:02:51.930 --> 01:02:55.930]  To another grower friend because I saw pictures of him
[01:02:55.930 --> 01:02:59.930]  So Spence and that one dude are the only people that really got seeds of this
[01:02:59.930 --> 01:03:03.930]  It smells very Girl Scout Cookies-y, but once you start grinding it
[01:03:03.930 --> 01:03:07.930]  It releases a Chemdog fuel
[01:03:07.930 --> 01:03:11.930]  Funk, dirty feet sort of a thing
[01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:15.930]  It's kind of like if you hid your bag of Girl Scout Cookies weed in a dirty sock
[01:03:15.930 --> 01:03:19.930]  It's so funky, I like it
[01:03:19.930 --> 01:03:23.930]  I've got it nice and ground up here in this chop shop grinder
[01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:27.930]  The consistency and texture that it grounded is perfect for a nice joint
[01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:31.930]  It's not too fine, it's not too coarse
[01:03:31.930 --> 01:03:35.930]  I actually did it the normal way, it says for a coarser grind to flip it upside down
[01:03:35.930 --> 01:03:39.930]  I did not do that
[01:03:39.930 --> 01:03:43.930]  I stuck two papers together because I like to roll fat joints
[01:03:43.930 --> 01:03:47.930]  I'm going to dump the dope into here and give it a twist and a lick
[01:03:47.930 --> 01:03:51.930]  Then we're going to smoke a joint together while we do a podcast
[01:03:51.930 --> 01:03:55.930]  I'm going to lick it and twist it, you won't hear me rambling while I lick it
[01:03:55.930 --> 01:03:59.930]  There's the twist, oh, got to tuck that corner
[01:03:59.930 --> 01:04:03.930]  The key to rolling a good joint is just getting that first corner tuck
[01:04:03.930 --> 01:04:09.520]  I'm going to give it a lick right now
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:13.520]  One thing I do, you guys might think I'm crazy, I lick the outside
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:17.520]  I don't lick the gummed part, because I feel like you just drag that gummed part around
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:21.520]  And you waste it. My joints tend to stick a lot better if I lick the outside
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:25.520]  And moisten that gum and don't lick it off with my tongue
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:29.520]  Before I light this joint, I should conclude my grinder review
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:33.520]  Chop shop grinder review, it's a little bit small
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:37.520]  But the small size is okay because of how light it is
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:41.520]  This is a much better backpack grinder, it ground my weed perfectly fine
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:45.520]  I like the little pollen catch that is actually a keef catch on the bottom here
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:49.520]  It came with a little scooper so that when I do have a nice collection I can scoop it up
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:53.520]  I'm going to say I approve of this grinder
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:57.520]  This is a great grinder, if you're looking for a grinder, this one would make you happy
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:01.520]  So shout out to chop shop grinders, make sure you check them out on the interweb
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:05.520]  Alright, I've got a joint rolled up so I'm going to light this joint
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:09.520]  And we're going to smoke a joint together, hopefully you guys are rolling something
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:13.520]  Alright, so I'm going to light this joint, send me a tweet and let me know what you're smoking with me
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:17.520]  Send the tweet to, at GFYH podcast
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:21.520]  Is that it? Yeah, at GFYH podcast, damn my brain went blank, I haven't even lit this joint yet
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:25.520]  So send me a tweet there, let me know what you're smoking on, I would love to hear it
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:29.520]  Because I'm going to light this joint and then we're going to get to the main topic of this podcast
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:33.520]  The main topic is going to be, it's kind of a double topic
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:37.520]  It's male selection and starting a breeding project
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:41.520]  So it's going to be male selection and breeding projects, I'm going to choose two of those emails and read them to you
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:45.520]  And then we will also talk about pollen storage and we'll talk about another product
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:49.520]  So let's light this joint and then we'll read an email
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:57.610]  That tastes really good
[01:05:57.610 --> 01:06:01.610]  I don't smoke a whole bunch of flower, so when I do light a big joint of some weed that I grew
[01:06:01.610 --> 01:06:05.610]  That was dried and cured perfectly and trimmed by me, oh it's a real treat
[01:06:05.610 --> 01:06:12.290]  Oh and it burns nicely
[01:06:12.290 --> 01:06:20.120]  I wish somebody was here to pass this joint to
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:24.120]  Okay, we're going to smoke this joint and read an email
[01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:28.120]  The email goes like this
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:32.120]  Hi Rasta Jeff, I discovered your podcast a couple of months ago and I've become an avid fan
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:36.120]  You present a perfect balance of friendly personality and real information
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:40.120]  Many, in fact I'd say most cannabis podcasters do too much of one or the other
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:44.120]  Like many of your fans, my only problem is wanting more episodes and for them to be longer
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:48.120]  I've been wanting a lot longer episodes you guys, I hope you've noticed that the last episode was a lot longer
[01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:52.120]  And when Mike is here, the episodes get really long, so I'm trying to make them a little bit longer for you
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:58.610]  This joint is just hitting like a champ you guys
[01:06:58.610 --> 01:07:02.610]  I'm going to keep puffing on it, this whole area is cloudy already
[01:07:02.610 --> 01:07:06.610]  Anyway, the email goes on to say I particularly enjoy hearing all about your breeding projects
[01:07:06.610 --> 01:07:10.610]  I was wondering if you might be able to talk on the show about how you would go about
[01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:14.610]  Starting a small breeding project from the ground up
[01:07:14.610 --> 01:07:18.610]  I've been thinking about what breeding I'd really like to explore in the future
[01:07:18.610 --> 01:07:22.610]  I'd like to know about your strategy for choosing strains or for choosing traits and strains you want to cross
[01:07:22.610 --> 01:07:26.610]  And how you keep a male you like, such as Solomon, going for multiple breeds
[01:07:26.610 --> 01:07:30.610]  And how long the process from ideal idea to stable seeds takes
[01:07:30.610 --> 01:07:34.610]  Also, I run the mom department at a large dispensary in Denver
[01:07:34.610 --> 01:07:38.610]  And because I have limited space to work with, I have started using bonsai techniques
[01:07:38.610 --> 01:07:42.610]  Such as root pruning to keep the moms small
[01:07:42.610 --> 01:07:46.610]  I've been using this technique, they live fairly happy in a 2 gallon pot indefinitely
[01:07:46.610 --> 01:07:50.610]  Staying around a foot or two tall
[01:07:50.610 --> 01:07:54.610]  So far my oldest is about a year old and her clones still root and produce healthy plants
[01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:58.610]  I was wondering if you have any knowledge or experience with this method that you would want to share with someone who is trying it out
[01:07:58.610 --> 01:08:02.610]  Honestly, teach me that method please
[01:08:02.610 --> 01:08:06.610]  Because my mother plants grow so quickly that I have to put them into larger pots
[01:08:06.610 --> 01:08:10.610]  And this sounds like something that would benefit me
[01:08:10.610 --> 01:08:14.610]  I have a large amount of mother plants and I don't have a lot of space
[01:08:14.610 --> 01:08:18.610]  So please send me your tech on this, share that with me
[01:08:18.610 --> 01:08:22.610]  And I will talk about it more on the show for other listeners
[01:08:22.610 --> 01:08:26.610]  So the email goes on to say, lastly I was hoping you could give this dab amateur a few tips on not coughing so hard after dabs
[01:08:26.610 --> 01:08:30.610]  Thanks for all the great podcasts
[01:08:30.610 --> 01:08:34.610]  They keep me smiling and learning
[01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:38.610]  Cheers, Jessica
[01:08:38.610 --> 01:08:42.610]  Jessica included her Instagram handle and I am now following you there
[01:08:42.610 --> 01:08:46.610]  Thanks for the email, let's go over a couple of those things real quick
[01:08:46.610 --> 01:08:50.610]  First off, thanks for the compliment, you started the email by complimenting me
[01:08:50.610 --> 01:08:54.610]  I do appreciate that, I do need to learn more about your mother plant tech
[01:08:54.610 --> 01:08:58.610]  But then you said you were hoping that I could give you a few tips on not coughing so hard after dabs
[01:08:58.610 --> 01:09:02.610]  I am going to reveal some Jedi secrets for you
[01:09:02.610 --> 01:09:06.610]  First off, if you're coughing a lot, your nail may be too hot
[01:09:06.610 --> 01:09:10.610]  Let that nail cool, go for some low temp dabs
[01:09:10.610 --> 01:09:14.610]  You probably know that already, so I'm going to teach you some Rasta Jeff tricks
[01:09:14.610 --> 01:09:18.610]  I take gigantic dabs
[01:09:18.610 --> 01:09:22.610]  I know that a lot of my lung health and how large my dabs can be
[01:09:22.610 --> 01:09:26.610]  My ability to take large dabs directly correlates with my level of hydration
[01:09:26.610 --> 01:09:30.610]  That's what I'm trying to say
[01:09:30.610 --> 01:09:34.610]  If I don't drink enough water and I get dry, my lungs get sore and I cannot take the dabs that I desire to take
[01:09:34.610 --> 01:09:38.610]  It hurts, so I have to stay hydrated
[01:09:38.610 --> 01:09:42.610]  I have to drink plenty of water, the more water I drink, the bigger dabs I can take
[01:09:42.610 --> 01:09:46.610]  That is the truth
[01:09:46.610 --> 01:09:50.610]  Also, I have to exercise my lungs and allow my lungs time to rest
[01:09:50.610 --> 01:09:54.610]  Your lungs need rest, they're like a giant muscle, they expand and contract
[01:09:54.610 --> 01:09:58.610]  I don't know if they're really a muscle, but they work that way, they get bigger, they get smaller, they grow
[01:09:58.610 --> 01:10:02.610]  You breathe in, you breathe out, you're putting a lot of work on them, they need some time to rest
[01:10:02.610 --> 01:10:06.610]  I have to get the heart rate moving, I have to get the blood moving
[01:10:06.610 --> 01:10:10.610]  I do some breathing
[01:10:10.610 --> 01:10:14.610]  I do not do a pre-dab breathe exercise, I just breathe
[01:10:14.610 --> 01:10:18.610]  I let the lungs wake up, let my body get breathing
[01:10:18.610 --> 01:10:22.610]  If my first dab makes me want to choke, I can control my body
[01:10:22.610 --> 01:10:26.610]  I've said this to a friend, I've said this to a couple of people
[01:10:26.610 --> 01:10:30.610]  Most of us, if you get a leg twitch or a leg cramp or a leg itch or if your foot itches
[01:10:30.610 --> 01:10:34.610]  You don't just fall on the ground and start twitching and you don't go out of control and you don't just give up
[01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:38.610]  Maybe your children do that, I've seen kids do it, it's fucking hilarious
[01:10:38.610 --> 01:10:42.610]  But we don't do that as adults, so why would we let our lungs be out of control?
[01:10:42.610 --> 01:10:46.610]  Unless you're sick or something, I'm not trying to make fun of anybody
[01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:50.610]  But a normal human being, a normal adult person, myself
[01:10:50.610 --> 01:10:54.610]  I would not accept my leg just walking out from underneath me, that's not tolerated
[01:10:54.610 --> 01:10:58.610]  So if my leg starts to get a cramp or something, I use my mind and I control my legs
[01:10:58.610 --> 01:11:02.610]  And I say, stand still motherfucker
[01:11:02.610 --> 01:11:06.610]  So I do the same thing with my lungs, you guys, if I'm about to choke, my lungs are mine
[01:11:06.610 --> 01:11:10.610]  I do not have to let my lungs do this rapid expansion and make me choke and turn purple and feel like shit
[01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:14.610]  When I'm about to cough, I breathe in as hard as I can
[01:11:14.610 --> 01:11:18.610]  You feel that tickle, you go, and your body goes, and your chest does this instant move
[01:11:18.610 --> 01:11:22.610]  When I feel that coming, I breathe in as hard as I can
[01:11:22.610 --> 01:11:26.610]  And now I've just changed my lungs mind
[01:11:26.610 --> 01:11:30.610]  It wanted to cough, but it's like, oh, I'm busy, I can't cough because he's got me inhaling
[01:11:30.610 --> 01:11:34.610]  And then as soon as I get that breath as far in me as I can
[01:11:34.610 --> 01:11:38.610]  I push out, I parse my lips and I push my smoke goes out at this point
[01:11:38.610 --> 01:11:42.610]  I push out as hard as I can
[01:11:42.610 --> 01:11:46.610]  But through parsed lips, I talked about this in the past episode
[01:11:46.610 --> 01:11:50.610]  I keep my lips kind of together to keep that air coming out slowly
[01:11:50.610 --> 01:11:54.610]  So now there's pressure on my lung, but I'm not blowing out all that smoke at one ridiculous time
[01:11:54.610 --> 01:11:58.610]  And that's keeping my lung busy
[01:11:58.610 --> 01:12:02.610]  I'm so busy focusing on that breath that my lungs will not twitch
[01:12:02.610 --> 01:12:06.610]  I am Jedi mind tricking myself. I am yoga breathing, I am Lamaze breathing
[01:12:06.610 --> 01:12:10.610]  And I'm just tricking my body into not being able to cough by keeping it busy
[01:12:10.610 --> 01:12:14.610]  There's a guy by the name of Wim Hof
[01:12:14.610 --> 01:12:18.610]  Who teaches a lot of breathing techniques and a lot of body healing techniques just through breathing
[01:12:18.610 --> 01:12:22.610]  A lot of yoga is based on breathing, a lot of meditation is based on breathing
[01:12:22.610 --> 01:12:26.610]  Lamaze is all breathing
[01:12:26.610 --> 01:12:30.610]  I feel like if these things can get you through huge situations in life
[01:12:30.610 --> 01:12:34.610]  Women use Lamaze to get through childbirth
[01:12:34.610 --> 01:12:38.610]  I delivered a child, I'm a father, my child was born at home
[01:12:38.610 --> 01:12:42.610]  I delivered that kid, I saw the kind of breathing that mama had to do to not lose her shit
[01:12:42.610 --> 01:12:46.610]  It was the only thing she had, she could scream at me, she could have faith in whatever she has faith in
[01:12:46.610 --> 01:12:50.610]  And she could breathe
[01:12:50.610 --> 01:12:54.610]  It was the only thing I could physically see get her through the pain
[01:12:54.610 --> 01:12:58.610]  And the challenge of having a child
[01:12:58.610 --> 01:13:02.610]  So breathing is magical, control your breath, that's what I'm trying to say
[01:13:02.610 --> 01:13:06.610]  You don't let your legs run out from underneath you, you don't let your hand punch you in the face
[01:13:06.610 --> 01:13:10.610]  You don't let your lungs spaz out and cough, just take a big breath
[01:13:10.610 --> 01:13:14.610]  Sometimes you gotta go in through your nose, sometimes you gotta go in through the mouth
[01:13:14.610 --> 01:13:18.610]  You'll figure it out, it's all about just tricking your lungs
[01:13:18.610 --> 01:13:22.610]  And you'll keep that feeling, and it'll only take 2 or 3 breaths to get your lungs to not even want to choke anymore
[01:13:22.610 --> 01:13:26.610]  And once you get good at it, you'll be able to control it a lot
[01:13:26.610 --> 01:13:30.610]  I'm not sure if what I'm doing to myself is good for my body
[01:13:30.610 --> 01:13:34.610]  But I'm sure that the violent coughing fits that you get when you take too big of a dab
[01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:38.610]  Are not good for your body either, so I am probably saving myself some stress
[01:13:38.610 --> 01:13:42.610]  I think that your lungs only get so many expansion and contractions
[01:13:42.610 --> 01:13:46.610]  And inhales and exhales and so many coughs before something starts to go wrong
[01:13:46.610 --> 01:13:50.610]  Like any car part or whatever, they're gonna blow out
[01:13:50.610 --> 01:13:54.610]  So I'm just trying to get as many miles on my lungs as I can without blowing them out
[01:13:54.610 --> 01:13:58.610]  That's what I'm trying to do. I think a lot of what I learned, the breathing technique
[01:13:58.610 --> 01:14:02.610]  Came from a man by the name of Sergio Herrera
[01:14:02.610 --> 01:14:06.610]  Shout out to Sergio Herrera and Sergio Jr.
[01:14:06.610 --> 01:14:10.610]  When I was a youngster, I took a karate class instructed by Master Sergio Herrera
[01:14:10.610 --> 01:14:14.610]  And he taught us a lot about breathing
[01:14:14.610 --> 01:14:18.610]  He taught us breathing techniques to calm my body and my mind
[01:14:18.610 --> 01:14:22.610]  When we would run out of breath, he would work us
[01:14:22.610 --> 01:14:26.610]  The karate instructor would work you until you were exhausted
[01:14:26.610 --> 01:14:30.610]  And he would make you control your breath. He would make you breathe in as deeply as you could through your nose
[01:14:30.610 --> 01:14:34.610]  And once your lungs are filled with air, your chest is fully expanded
[01:14:34.610 --> 01:14:38.610]  You feel like you're full, he would tell you to breathe in a little more
[01:14:38.610 --> 01:14:42.610]  And you just have to force in a little breath through your nose
[01:14:42.610 --> 01:14:46.610]  And once he thinks you're full and he's satisfied, he'll tell you to blow all the way out
[01:14:46.610 --> 01:14:50.610]  And he would make us blow out and he would say, there's more in there, blow it out
[01:14:50.610 --> 01:14:54.610]  And you'd be squeezing weird muscles to force your lungs to push out that last bit of air
[01:14:54.610 --> 01:14:58.610]  And your body would make weird noises because you're trying to push air out that's not there
[01:14:58.610 --> 01:15:02.610]  And then he would immediately make you breathe right in again as hard as you can
[01:15:02.610 --> 01:15:06.610]  Now go deep! And that was how I would slow my heart rate
[01:15:06.610 --> 01:15:10.610]  And my breathing and get control, get my composure again when I was in a
[01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:14.610]  A spar or a karate tournament or a match and my heart rate and my mind were getting away
[01:15:14.610 --> 01:15:18.610]  Or my breathing was getting away, that was our way to re-center and it works
[01:15:18.610 --> 01:15:22.610]  It only takes two or three of those, five of those and you are on top of your game all over again
[01:15:22.610 --> 01:15:26.610]  So the trick to not coughing is control your lungs
[01:15:26.610 --> 01:15:30.610]  Be a Jedi about it, keep your lungs busy, your lungs can't freak out and start coughing
[01:15:30.610 --> 01:15:34.610]  If you're controlling them and your mind and your lungs are stuck together
[01:15:34.610 --> 01:15:38.610]  You're just focused on that breathing, that in and out, the only things you gotta do
[01:15:38.610 --> 01:15:42.610]  Breathe in, breathe out. So I do want to answer more of your breathing question
[01:15:42.610 --> 01:15:46.610]  But I've got another email that I want to read and I will answer both of the questions
[01:15:46.610 --> 01:15:50.610]  Kind of at once, so I'm finding the other email, it's here in my phone I promise
[01:15:50.610 --> 01:15:54.610]  This email has a lot of stuff going on so it'll take me a second to get through it
[01:15:54.610 --> 01:15:58.610]  But it goes like this and by the way just in case you're wondering I'm a little more than halfway
[01:15:58.610 --> 01:16:02.610]  Through this joint, I've been puffing it when you don't hear me talking and I'm getting
[01:16:02.610 --> 01:16:06.610]  Well medicated. Alright this email goes like this
[01:16:06.610 --> 01:16:10.610]  Hey Rasta Jeff, how's it going? I've been listening to your podcast for a while now
[01:16:10.610 --> 01:16:14.610]  And I have a few questions on breathing. I'm out here in Colorado just doing it
[01:16:14.610 --> 01:16:18.610]  I have a new tree of life high CBD strain going
[01:16:18.610 --> 01:16:22.610]  I had 100% germination and 50% male to female ratio
[01:16:22.610 --> 01:16:28.610]  Pretty solid I'd say. I was wondering when selecting a male to use for pollination as the father
[01:16:28.610 --> 01:16:32.610]  What do you look for? That is a very good question, I'm going to talk about that in just a second
[01:16:32.610 --> 01:16:38.610]  But I want to get through your email. You also say do you do any testing on the leaves to find CBD or THC content?
[01:16:38.610 --> 01:16:44.610]  And he also mentions that he's obviously looking for the lowest THC possible as to keep them under the 0.3% THC
[01:16:44.610 --> 01:16:48.610]  So if you want your plants to qualify as hemp in Colorado
[01:16:48.610 --> 01:16:52.610]  They have to test at less than 0.3% THC
[01:16:52.610 --> 01:16:56.610]  Or they are considered cannabis and you can't sell them
[01:16:56.610 --> 01:17:00.610]  You can't sell that flower as hemp flower
[01:17:00.610 --> 01:17:04.610]  It has to be grown in a completely different environment with completely different licensing
[01:17:04.610 --> 01:17:08.610]  And if it tests too high, if you grow your hemp at a hemp farm and it tests too high in THC
[01:17:08.610 --> 01:17:12.610]  It must be destroyed. So he's trying to breed and he's trying to keep it low THC high CBD
[01:17:12.610 --> 01:17:16.610]  The email goes on to say is there any truth in having males growing next to females could make the females hermy?
[01:17:16.610 --> 01:17:20.610]  I heard that recently somewhere
[01:17:20.610 --> 01:17:24.610]  So he's asking if having males grow next to the females will make the females herm?
[01:17:24.610 --> 01:17:28.610]  No, that will not happen.
[01:17:28.610 --> 01:17:32.610]  If you have males near your female plants, I feel like the females know the males are there
[01:17:32.610 --> 01:17:36.610]  And they get stickier and the trichomes get a little thicker
[01:17:36.610 --> 01:17:40.610]  And it's like I think the female plants can smell the males
[01:17:40.610 --> 01:17:44.610]  Or they can feel a pheromone or a hormone in the air
[01:17:44.610 --> 01:17:48.610]  And they get a little hornier and they show more signs of wanting pollen
[01:17:48.610 --> 01:17:52.610]  So no, having a male plant near your female plants will not make the females herm
[01:17:52.610 --> 01:17:56.610]  But what will happen is the males will be able to see the females
[01:17:56.610 --> 01:18:00.610]  But what will happen is the males will pollinate the females
[01:18:00.610 --> 01:18:04.610]  And it will not take much pollen and it will not take a lot of time
[01:18:04.610 --> 01:18:08.610]  So the females won't herm, they will seed because they were properly pollinated
[01:18:08.610 --> 01:18:12.610]  Now you say when breeding, when is the best time to hit the ladies with pollen?
[01:18:12.610 --> 01:18:16.610]  I'm going to talk about that here and more of my breeding rant when I combine the two emails with one answer
[01:18:16.610 --> 01:18:20.610]  Oh and I just realized that I skipped right over your part about asking about testing
[01:18:20.610 --> 01:18:24.610]  I do not do any testing on the leaves to find CBD or THC
[01:18:24.610 --> 01:18:28.610]  However that is a very useful option that is available from our friends at Steep Hill Labs
[01:18:28.610 --> 01:18:32.610]  So if you want to do that, I highly encourage that
[01:18:32.610 --> 01:18:36.610]  That will give you an idea but it will not give you the exact potency
[01:18:36.610 --> 01:18:40.610]  But it will give you an idea of what the ratios will be
[01:18:40.610 --> 01:18:44.610]  So you can have the leaves tested. Once again I would recommend Steep Hill Labs for that
[01:18:44.610 --> 01:18:48.610]  They can also do early testing to tell you if your plants from seed are males or females
[01:18:48.610 --> 01:18:52.610]  So I'm going to continue with the email where are you going to test?
[01:18:52.610 --> 01:18:56.610]  I'm going to continue with the email where was I?
[01:18:56.610 --> 01:19:00.610]  It also says will they need 6-7 weeks to fully mature? I'm going to talk about that in a little more detail in just a couple of minutes
[01:19:00.610 --> 01:19:04.610]  You also go on to say I have a lot of testing to be done on my 10 female phenos
[01:19:04.610 --> 01:19:08.610]  5 cherry wine F3 and 5 cobblers
[01:19:08.610 --> 01:19:12.610]  Testing to begin at day 43 of flower to day 56 per pheno
[01:19:12.610 --> 01:19:16.610]  To find that highest CBD content and lowest THC content
[01:19:16.610 --> 01:19:20.610]  Good luck with your pheno hunting there. Pheno hunting is always fun
[01:19:20.610 --> 01:19:24.610]  I love doing a nice pheno hunt. I hope you find the phenotype that you're looking for
[01:19:24.610 --> 01:19:28.610]  I hope you find that perfect CBD for yourself
[01:19:28.610 --> 01:19:32.610]  I hope you're able to make great medicine. I hope this project goes well
[01:19:32.610 --> 01:19:36.610]  You go on to say thank you for your time and keep the podcast going. I only came across yours recently
[01:19:36.610 --> 01:19:40.610]  Been listening to a bunch of your old ones. Is there access to some of your older ones that are not in the feed?
[01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:44.610]  I'm not sure how many episodes Stitcher is holding
[01:19:44.610 --> 01:19:48.610]  But iTunes has the most recent 100 episodes
[01:19:48.610 --> 01:19:52.610]  If you're listening through my website
[01:19:52.610 --> 01:19:56.610]  I read genetics Colorado.com
[01:19:56.610 --> 01:20:00.610]  You can go to the I read genetics Colorado.com website
[01:20:00.610 --> 01:20:04.610]  There's a grow from your heart podcast tab. Click on that. That will take you to the podcast
[01:20:04.610 --> 01:20:08.610]  To the best of my knowledge there should be 100 episodes available there
[01:20:08.610 --> 01:20:12.610]  Which will get you all the way back to we're at 174
[01:20:12.610 --> 01:20:16.610]  So you'll get all the way back to about 75
[01:20:16.610 --> 01:20:20.610]  Which that's a lot of content. However, if you do want the old stuff
[01:20:20.610 --> 01:20:24.610]  I plan on putting the older episodes back into the feed
[01:20:24.610 --> 01:20:28.610]  Just re-dropping them is kind of like new episodes. I'll add a new intro
[01:20:28.610 --> 01:20:32.610]  I'll talk to you a minute. Let you know it's a repeat and we'll put the old episodes back
[01:20:32.610 --> 01:20:36.610]  If you're impatient and you don't want to wait for that send me an email
[01:20:36.610 --> 01:20:40.610]  And I will consider sending you the files
[01:20:40.610 --> 01:20:44.610]  For older episodes. I don't know how many I can do at a time
[01:20:44.610 --> 01:20:48.610]  If I get several people that want them together I'll try to send them in chunks
[01:20:48.610 --> 01:20:52.610]  So if there are a few of you that want those old episodes sent in chunks
[01:20:52.610 --> 01:20:56.610]  Send me an email and I'll try to get them out to you guys. Maybe this will get something going
[01:20:56.610 --> 01:21:00.610]  But I do intend on putting them back into the feed
[01:21:00.610 --> 01:21:04.610]  So like starting around episode 200 was kind of my idea. We'll get 200 episodes out
[01:21:04.610 --> 01:21:08.610]  And then maybe once every two weeks or once a week on a Thursday we'll just plop in
[01:21:08.610 --> 01:21:12.610]  We'll do episode. I don't think I'm going to start with one because one was terrible
[01:21:12.610 --> 01:21:16.610]  We'll do like episode. Old episodes in not perfect order but we'll do them in chronological order
[01:21:16.610 --> 01:21:20.610]  But we may skip a few. So there will be a way to hear old episodes
[01:21:20.610 --> 01:21:24.610]  And if you're really dying to hear those first few send me an email we'll figure it out
[01:21:24.610 --> 01:21:28.610]  He goes on to say all I do is garden and listen to podcasts
[01:21:28.610 --> 01:21:32.610]  And it was funny to hear the ones you listen to were all the same ones I listen to
[01:21:32.610 --> 01:21:36.610]  All the comic podcasts for sure except Bill Burr is at the top of my list
[01:21:36.610 --> 01:21:40.610]  And you had him down at the bottom of yours. Yeah Bill Burr is a bit much for me
[01:21:40.610 --> 01:21:44.610]  He gets, I know it's funny that I'm sitting here doing a podcast by myself
[01:21:44.610 --> 01:21:48.610]  But to listen to Bill Burr rant by himself on a podcast sometimes isn't my favorite thing
[01:21:48.610 --> 01:21:52.610]  And he talks about shit that I don't, I'm not, he talks a lot about god damn sports
[01:21:52.610 --> 01:21:56.610]  And I don't care about football at all. So that's why I don't listen to Bill Burr as much as some people
[01:21:56.610 --> 01:22:00.610]  I kind of religiously listen to Rogan, Doug Benson, Joey Coco Diaz
[01:22:00.610 --> 01:22:04.610]  Those are a lot of my favorites. Also I've been listening to a podcast
[01:22:04.610 --> 01:22:08.610]  That I think you guys would enjoy. Let me give a shout out to my friend Bo Nellis
[01:22:08.610 --> 01:22:12.610]  She's been getting a shout out on the past few podcasts but she's been reciprocating on her show
[01:22:12.610 --> 01:22:16.610]  She does a great podcast about cannabis. Her show is called
[01:22:16.610 --> 01:22:20.610]  The Spliff Podcast
[01:22:20.610 --> 01:22:24.610]  And I know that I say the word spliff poorly because my voice, my mouth, my accent
[01:22:24.610 --> 01:22:28.610]  The word spliff fucking sucks for my mouth and now I've got cotton mouth from smoking this whole joint
[01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:32.610]  So I'm probably saying it even worse but the name of her podcast is Spliff
[01:22:32.610 --> 01:22:36.610]  The Spliff podcast
[01:22:36.610 --> 01:22:40.610]  The Spliff podcast
[01:22:40.610 --> 01:22:44.610]  So make sure you check out Bo Nellis at The Spliff Podcast
[01:22:44.610 --> 01:22:48.610]  I think you would appreciate that. So you say hit me back when you get a minute
[01:22:48.610 --> 01:22:52.610]  And then you sign the email with the name Buck. Bro I hope this worked out as hitting you back
[01:22:52.610 --> 01:22:56.610]  I will send you an email to let you know to listen to this episode
[01:22:56.610 --> 01:23:00.610]  But dude, here's your official hit back. You guys, Jess and Buck
[01:23:00.610 --> 01:23:04.610]  I appreciate both of you for the email. I appreciate both of you being interested in breeding
[01:23:04.610 --> 01:23:08.610]  I need to take a quick drink so I'm going to press pause and take a drink
[01:23:08.610 --> 01:23:12.610]  And when I get back I am going to rant a long time about starting a breeding project
[01:23:12.610 --> 01:23:16.610]  And selecting a good male
[01:23:16.610 --> 01:23:42.420]  Alright podcast world, I am back. I am nicely hydrated
[01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:46.420]  I am nicely medicated. I know I smoked that whole joint while we were talking
[01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:50.420]  But something made me want to take some dabs while I was taking a break
[01:23:50.420 --> 01:23:54.420]  So I took a couple of dabs. I know my head is a little spinny and I feel super good
[01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:58.420]  Let's get back to the podcast. You guys that asked for longer episodes
[01:23:58.420 --> 01:24:02.420]  Are truly going to get what you've been asking for in this podcast because I've been going for 30 minutes now
[01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:06.420]  And we're just about to get to the main topic. The main topic of course
[01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:10.420]  Is breeding. Setting up a breeding area and also selecting your males
[01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:14.420]  And we'll talk a little bit about selecting your females for your breeding project
[01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:18.420]  Alright the first thing I should talk about when you're going to start a breeding project
[01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:22.420]  Is books. Where do books come into play? Books are the first thing
[01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:26.420]  Before you do anything with cannabis, before you start growing, before you start breeding
[01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:30.420]  Before you start doing anything with weed, you should read about it
[01:24:30.420 --> 01:24:34.420]  Read about growing. Be prepared. Know what's coming. I know you listen to a podcast
[01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:38.420]  That's all about weed but I can't tell you everything. If you bought a basic grow book
[01:24:38.420 --> 01:24:42.420]  And read it from beginning to end and then started growing weed, you would be prepared
[01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:46.420]  For all the shit that's coming and you wouldn't be in scramble mode. So books. Get some books
[01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:50.420]  Read about breeding. Just read the basics of breeding. Two books that I could really recommend
[01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:54.420]  Are the Cannabis Breeders Bible by Greg Green
[01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:58.420]  That is available online in a PDF for free. So you have no excuse
[01:24:58.420 --> 01:25:02.420]  Go online. Type in Cannabis Breeders Bible
[01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:06.420]  It'll pop up as a PDF in Google. Go read that. Also
[01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:10.420]  I truly recommend a book that I'm pulling up on my phone here. It is called
[01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:14.420]  It's just simply Marijuana Botany by Robert Connell Clark. I highly recommend
[01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:18.420]  Both of those books if you're going to do any breeding. If you want to read
[01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:22.420]  Further about cannabis growing, I also recommend anything from
[01:25:22.420 --> 01:25:26.420]  Jorge Cervantes. I also like Let's Grow a Pound. I also
[01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:30.420]  Like all of the Ed Rosenthal grow books. The Ed Rosenthal Oakster Damn Course
[01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:34.420]  Guide is a great grow book in my opinion. But start
[01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:38.420]  With the Cannabis Breeders Bible. Then move on to Marijuana Botany
[01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:42.420]  And you will have a great basic understanding of cannabis
[01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:46.420]  So once you have an understanding of cannabis and a kind of an idea for breeding
[01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:50.420]  You need to build a grow room or use your existing grow room
[01:25:50.420 --> 01:25:54.420]  For a breeding area. So a breeding room is just like any other
[01:25:54.420 --> 01:25:58.420]  Grow room. You need a grow light. You need it sealed up. You need a sealed room
[01:25:58.420 --> 01:26:02.420]  So that when it is dark, a light seal is what I mean. When it is dark
[01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:06.420]  You cannot have any light coming into that room. So whenever you choose to have
[01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:10.420]  Your dark period for 12 hours at a time, there can be
[01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:14.420]  No light interruptions, no light leaks. So you need a room with a light
[01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:18.420]  On a timer. You need a controllable dark time. You need to
[01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:22.420]  Be able to get water to that room and you need to be able to get old air out and fresh
[01:26:22.420 --> 01:26:26.420]  Air into that room. If you already have a grow room
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:30.420]  It probably can be used just like it is. The only thing you need to consider
[01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:34.420]  Is pollen. That room is going to get filled with pollen. And wherever you were
[01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:38.420]  Ducting your exhaust, pollen is going to go
[01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:42.420]  Out there. So if you have an outdoor garden and you're ducting your
[01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:46.420]  Grow room outside, you may be blowing pollen right into your outdoor garden
[01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:50.420]  If you have another grow room that's in flower, you need to control
[01:26:50.420 --> 01:26:54.420]  Where that pollen goes. A good way to keep tabs on pollen is water
[01:26:54.420 --> 01:26:58.420]  Water deactivates pollen. You need to find a way
[01:26:58.420 --> 01:27:02.420]  To either spray yourself, your plants, both
[01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:06.420]  For pollen control. If you get pollen in one room
[01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:10.420]  You're going to the other flower room. You need to hose yourself down and you need to spray down the female
[01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:14.420]  Plants that you don't want pollinated. And that will keep the pollen away from them.
[01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:18.420]  So basically you need a grow room with at least a 600
[01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:22.420]  Watt light or larger. People think, people will say
[01:27:22.420 --> 01:27:26.420]  That you can grow with a 400 or a 250 or an LED or a T5
[01:27:26.420 --> 01:27:30.420]  But I think a 600 watt light is the smallest I would use for breeding because
[01:27:30.420 --> 01:27:34.420]  I want strong healthy plants with strong healthy seeds. If you're looking for
[01:27:34.420 --> 01:27:38.420]  An affordable way to set up a breeding area and you don't have a lot of space
[01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:42.420]  Or a lot of funding, you can use a 5x5 or a 3x3
[01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:46.420]  Grow hut. I like to use the 5x5 grow hut with a 600 watt
[01:27:46.420 --> 01:27:50.420]  Or a 1000 watt light. The 600 watt light is plenty of light for a 5x5
[01:27:50.420 --> 01:27:54.420]  Hut. Trust me. In the summer I'll put a 600 in there. In the winter
[01:27:54.420 --> 01:27:58.420]  I'll put a 1000 in there because of course you can cool it much more easily in the
[01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:02.420]  Winter. The rooms are cold anyway because it's freezing outside so you just use that 1000 watt light
[01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:06.420]  To keep everything warm. Take advantage of your surroundings guys. That's what I think I'm saying.
[01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:10.420]  Get a 5x5 hut. Put a 600 watt light in there.
[01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:14.420]  I like to put a ducted hood in my huts.
[01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:18.420]  I've got a 5x5 hut with a ducted, I think it's like the ExtraSun 6
[01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:22.420]  Or the Daystar 6. Something like that. Just a basic hood in there. It's got 6 inch
[01:28:22.420 --> 01:28:26.420]  Ducting coming off of both sides and there is a hole for the ducting
[01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:30.420]  On each side of the hut so that ducting goes out of each side of the hut
[01:28:30.420 --> 01:28:34.420]  And on one end I've got a blower with a carbon filter
[01:28:34.420 --> 01:28:38.420]  So the air comes through the carbon filter, through the blower, through the ducting
[01:28:38.420 --> 01:28:42.420]  Into the hut, over the light, out of the light, out of the hut and then it just blows
[01:28:42.420 --> 01:28:46.420]  That air into the room. Basically blows it into another room
[01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:50.420]  For me is where I have it running. But what that does is it keeps the light
[01:28:50.420 --> 01:28:54.420]  The heat from the light never gets to go into my grow hut. So it kind of keeps my hut
[01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:58.420]  A little bit cooler. Also there's a 6 inch hole on the roof
[01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:02.420]  Of those grow huts. I get a 6 inch HydroFarm blower
[01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:06.420]  And just set it on top of the hut extracting air
[01:29:06.420 --> 01:29:10.420]  So it sucks air out and when you zip up the hut it kind of caves in a little bit
[01:29:10.420 --> 01:29:14.420]  Because of all the pressure but that's a good thing because it's sucking air in
[01:29:14.420 --> 01:29:18.420]  Through the bottom. It's sucking in fresh air constantly and shooting out hot stale air
[01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:22.420]  From the top all the time and heat rises so I'm pulling in cool air from the bottom
[01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:26.420]  Of the room that the hut is in and it's just shooting that air to the top
[01:29:26.420 --> 01:29:30.420]  So I'm always having circulation in there. I've got a light running. The light is
[01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:34.420]  Being cooled. So you've got two blowers. You've got a reflector with a light
[01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:38.420]  In it. You've got a little bit of ducting and a 5x5 hut. That's basically all you need
[01:29:38.420 --> 01:29:42.420]  And you can set up a breeding room. It would be helpful
[01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:46.420]  If you could have a separate space for your male plant to start flowering
[01:29:46.420 --> 01:29:50.420]  And so that you can keep your males and females apart until the ideal time for pollination
[01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:54.420]  But it's not absolutely necessary if you're breeding for personal
[01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:58.420]  Seed production. If you keep the plants apart for a little longer you're able
[01:29:58.420 --> 01:30:02.420]  To make a lot more seed is mainly the reason for doing that
[01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:06.420]  So something else I want to mention. I talked about pollen control
[01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:10.420]  Pollen control is hugely important for flowering plants
[01:30:10.420 --> 01:30:14.420]  Plants that are flowering from the time they show the hairs
[01:30:14.420 --> 01:30:18.420]  You guys call them probably. Those are pistils. Those are calyx pistils. From the time those
[01:30:18.420 --> 01:30:22.420]  Appear that plant is able to receive pollen
[01:30:22.420 --> 01:30:26.420]  And produce seeds. So if your plants have pistils you need to keep
[01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:30.420]  Pollen away from them. Veg plants cannot be pollinated
[01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:34.420]  Do not worry about veg plants. So if you have veg plants they'll be just fine
[01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:38.420]  Before you put them near flowering plants rinse them off with water
[01:30:38.420 --> 01:30:42.420]  Any pollen that got on them will be deactivated. You'll be just fine
[01:30:42.420 --> 01:30:46.420]  Also if you've been in your garden and your garden has pollen in it
[01:30:46.420 --> 01:30:50.420]  And you've been messing with pollen or if you've been pollinating your plants don't go to your friends house
[01:30:50.420 --> 01:30:54.420]  That grow because you don't want to fuck up their garden and seed their whole garden
[01:30:54.420 --> 01:30:58.420]  Don't go to the grocery store. Don't go to the dispensary. Change clothes. Take a shower
[01:30:58.420 --> 01:31:02.420]  Be proactive. Don't fuck up someone else's garden with your pollen
[01:31:02.420 --> 01:31:06.420]  And if you do have a male plant outside pay attention to who else is
[01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:10.420]  Growing around you and you may be fucking up someone else's garden. Just be aware
[01:31:10.420 --> 01:31:14.420]  Try to pay attention to what's going on like that. Alright so we talked about getting your
[01:31:14.420 --> 01:31:18.420]  Room built. We talked about pollen control and how important pollen control is
[01:31:18.420 --> 01:31:22.420]  Let's talk about nutrients. When you are breeding basic nutrients can be used for your
[01:31:22.420 --> 01:31:26.420]  Males and females. Just your basic flowering newts. I wouldn't use real heavy
[01:31:26.420 --> 01:31:30.420]  Bloom boosters or anything like that. It's not really necessary. Keep your nitrogen
[01:31:30.420 --> 01:31:34.420]  Your phosphorus, your potassium in there. Keep some carbohydrates coming. Maybe
[01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:38.420]  Add a little bit of amino acids for healthy seeds but basically your basic
[01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:42.420]  Feed is going to be just fine for your seeded plants
[01:31:42.420 --> 01:31:46.420]  Alright so we've got a little breeding room built and we know what to feed our plants
[01:31:46.420 --> 01:31:50.420]  Now I feel like it's time to talk about selecting your plants for a breeding project
[01:31:50.420 --> 01:31:54.420]  A big part about breeding is having a goal in mind
[01:31:54.420 --> 01:31:58.420]  You need to have kind of an idea of what you're trying to create with your breeding project
[01:31:58.420 --> 01:32:02.420]  Are you trying to make seeds for yourself so that you can keep growing in the future
[01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:06.420]  With fresh seeds? Are you trying to breed new strains? Are you trying to take a strain
[01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:10.420]  That is okay and improve it? Are you trying to back cross something? Have a goal
[01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:14.420]  In mind. Think about what you're trying to create or you're trying
[01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:18.420]  To improve. As a breeder it's your job to improve the cannabis plant
[01:32:18.420 --> 01:32:22.420]  And not go backwards. If the seeds that come out of your
[01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:26.420]  Breeding project are not better than the buds that they
[01:32:26.420 --> 01:32:30.420]  Came from you can throw the entire project away and start
[01:32:30.420 --> 01:32:34.420]  Another breeding project. You are trying to make something better
[01:32:34.420 --> 01:32:38.420]  Alright so let's talk a little bit about selecting females. Something you will get from
[01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:42.420]  The books that I did not talk about earlier are charts. You may want to learn
[01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:46.420]  About alial charts and mendal charts. There are a lot of
[01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:50.420]  Different charts to use. They are very helpful. If you're trying to target
[01:32:50.420 --> 01:32:54.420]  Specific traits use charts. If you're trying to create new
[01:32:54.420 --> 01:32:58.420]  Crosses to see what you can do with your favorite strains go ahead and throw some pollen
[01:32:58.420 --> 01:33:02.420]  And see what happens but make sure you test those seeds
[01:33:02.420 --> 01:33:06.420]  Very well before you give them out to anybody. Alright something else I want to
[01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:10.420]  Talk about is using stable females. A lot of people will get a clone and they'll say
[01:33:10.420 --> 01:33:14.420]  Hey I've got this plant. I want to breed to it. They'll get a male and they put some pollen on it
[01:33:14.420 --> 01:33:18.420]  Always grow out a new clone at least 2 or 3 times
[01:33:18.420 --> 01:33:22.420]  Before you breed with it. I like to put my females through a rigorous
[01:33:22.420 --> 01:33:26.420]  Stress test before I breed with them. I will put my female plants into
[01:33:26.420 --> 01:33:30.420]  Flower. I'll let them flower for 7-10 days and then I will completely
[01:33:30.420 --> 01:33:34.420]  Fuck up the timer in the grow room on purpose. My goal is to try
[01:33:34.420 --> 01:33:38.420]  To make these plants hermaphrodite by stressing them with light stress
[01:33:38.420 --> 01:33:42.420]  By disrupting their photo period. I'll turn the light on. I'll go from 12
[01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:46.420]  To 12 and then I will turn it off for 24 hours and then
[01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:50.420]  I will turn it on for 24 hours and then I'll put it back on 12-12 and I'll pay
[01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:54.420]  Attention to the plants. Some plants will herm with that much disruption
[01:33:54.420 --> 01:33:58.420]  Some of them take a little more so I'll fuck with them again. I'll turn
[01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:02.420]  The light on for 24 hours again and then turn it off for 12 hours
[01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:06.420]  Then turn it on for 6 or 8 hours. Then we'll go right back to the normal flowering cycle
[01:34:06.420 --> 01:34:10.420]  And I'll do this throughout the bloom phase and by day 35
[01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:14.420]  If something hasn't hermed I will consider it probably strong enough to go
[01:34:14.420 --> 01:34:18.420]  Into a breeding project. Of course I'll finish it out but I want to kind of fuck with these plants
[01:34:18.420 --> 01:34:22.420]  And see if they're hermaphrodite or not on me from messing with them and causing them stress
[01:34:22.420 --> 01:34:26.420]  Because the people that buy seeds are going to mess up
[01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:30.420]  And I want the progeny that comes from my breeding projects to be a little bit foolproof
[01:34:30.420 --> 01:34:34.420]  Because I want to give people a head start and not make them struggle from the beginning
[01:34:34.420 --> 01:34:38.420]  Alright so use females that are tested, that are trusted, that you've grown several times
[01:34:38.420 --> 01:34:42.420]  I like to use females that have desirable traits that I love
[01:34:42.420 --> 01:34:46.420]  That I think I can make a little bit better. Breeding is kind of like chefing
[01:34:46.420 --> 01:34:50.420]  You're about to put ingredients from the male plant with ingredients from the female plant together
[01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:54.420]  You're going to stir them up and then you're going to grow that and you're going to have a cake
[01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:58.420]  And that cake is your finished buds. So keep that in mind when you're making a cross
[01:34:58.420 --> 01:35:02.420]  You want a female that's got a good node structure. The inner node spacing is not too far apart
[01:35:02.420 --> 01:35:06.420]  On the main stalk. You want a female that flowers in a good amount of time
[01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:10.420]  I like 70 day plants honestly. A lot of people like plants that are done in 60 days
[01:35:10.420 --> 01:35:14.420]  I feel like a 70 day flowering plant has a lot of time to get the good quality sativa
[01:35:14.420 --> 01:35:18.420]  Style THC buzz that I like. The indica plants don't give me that head buzz that I like
[01:35:18.420 --> 01:35:22.420]  So a little longer plant. Something that smells real good
[01:35:22.420 --> 01:35:26.420]  And something that just grows real well and is desirable to smoke
[01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:30.420]  That's a female plant that you want to breed to
[01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:34.420]  Plants with a lot of resin usually produce offspring with a lot of resin
[01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:38.420]  So the more resinous your female plants the more likely you are to produce resiny offspring
[01:35:38.420 --> 01:35:42.420]  So basically your favorite females are great for breeding
[01:35:42.420 --> 01:35:46.420]  Everybody knows by now what a good female plant looks like
[01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:50.420]  That should be easy to find. So have a goal. Find a female plant
[01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:54.420]  You can use more than one female in a breeding project
[01:35:54.420 --> 01:35:58.420]  There's nothing stopping you from putting... I do several females in a room at one time
[01:35:58.420 --> 01:36:02.420]  I grow them kind of big and then I'll put... I do probably six
[01:36:02.420 --> 01:36:06.420]  I like to do six 7 gallon pots per 1000 watt light
[01:36:06.420 --> 01:36:10.420]  And I fudge them up to about... just between knee and waist height
[01:36:10.420 --> 01:36:14.420]  I'm 6 foot 5 so I'm going to say that's probably about 24 to 28 inches tall
[01:36:14.420 --> 01:36:18.420]  Fudge them about that tall and then I like to flower them
[01:36:18.420 --> 01:36:22.420]  And then when it's time I like to give them pollen
[01:36:22.420 --> 01:36:26.420]  And I get plenty of seeds from each plant. Sometimes each of those six plants under one light
[01:36:26.420 --> 01:36:30.420]  Will be a different strain. If I'm creating something new
[01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:34.420]  I will do six different plants in there just to see what I can create
[01:36:34.420 --> 01:36:38.420]  And I'll run all of those six new crosses myself to see what I've created
[01:36:38.420 --> 01:36:42.420]  And if it's something that I love I will fill a light with just one strain
[01:36:42.420 --> 01:36:46.420]  And repeat the process and make a bunch more seeds
[01:36:46.420 --> 01:36:50.420]  So that we can put them to the market or we can just do whatever needs to be done with them
[01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:54.420]  So the first time I cross it I just do a whole bunch of plants in there
[01:36:54.420 --> 01:36:58.420]  And then I find the best of that new cross
[01:36:58.420 --> 01:37:02.420]  And I repeat those. So it's kind of a process of elimination
[01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:06.420]  The things that you see come to market from me
[01:37:06.420 --> 01:37:10.420]  Is a very small portion of what I create. I honestly don't continue a lot of things
[01:37:10.420 --> 01:37:14.420]  So those six that I put under one light
[01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:18.420]  I'll put six different girls under there. I'll use one male and pollinate those
[01:37:18.420 --> 01:37:22.420]  Maybe two or three of those will get repeated and the rest will get abandoned
[01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:26.420]  And I won't make more of that cross. So you can put multiple females
[01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:30.420]  In the room for breeding and you can make multiple different crosses
[01:37:30.420 --> 01:37:34.420]  If you're making seeds for yourself that's a really fun way to do it
[01:37:34.420 --> 01:37:38.420]  And then you can find a whole bunch of great new things
[01:37:38.420 --> 01:37:42.420]  Now I'm going to do a little bit of talking about male selection
[01:37:42.420 --> 01:37:46.420]  I did an entire podcast about selecting males. Episode number 121 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast
[01:37:46.420 --> 01:37:50.420]  Is all about male selection. If you want a really in-depth podcast
[01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:54.420]  About choosing a male for breeding check out episode number 121
[01:37:54.420 --> 01:37:58.420]  It will give you a lot of information but if you don't want to go back
[01:37:58.420 --> 01:38:02.420]  And listen to that one here is the short course for this episode
[01:38:02.420 --> 01:38:06.420]  Choosing a male is very important because I think the male
[01:38:06.420 --> 01:38:10.420]  Will provide a lot of the aroma, a lot of the structure, and a lot of the
[01:38:10.420 --> 01:38:14.420]  General health of the plant. The pest resistance, the mold resistance
[01:38:14.420 --> 01:38:18.420]  A lot of that is going to come from your male. So something I look for in a male plant
[01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:22.420]  Is structure. The way the plant is shaped is going to predict
[01:38:22.420 --> 01:38:26.420]  A lot of what your females or your offspring, I'm sorry, your progeny
[01:38:26.420 --> 01:38:30.420]  Are going to be shaped like. So if you want a sativa dominant plant that gets
[01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:34.420]  Kind of tall, that grows really tall colas, you want a male that gets
[01:38:34.420 --> 01:38:38.420]  Tall and has really tall colas. If you want a short, stout, indica dominant
[01:38:38.420 --> 01:38:42.420]  Plant, you want a male that grows short and stout
[01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:46.420]  And squat and is shaped the way you want it. So think about
[01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:50.420]  What you want out of your breeding. This is where having a goal comes into play
[01:38:50.420 --> 01:38:54.420]  So structure is important to me. I like close, close tight node
[01:38:54.420 --> 01:38:58.420]  Structures. So when that stem starts growing, I want a set of branches
[01:38:58.420 --> 01:39:02.420]  To come out, and then I want about an inch, and then another
[01:39:02.420 --> 01:39:06.420]  Set of branches coming out, and then like an inch, and then more branches. Nice, close
[01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:10.420]  Tight inter-nodal spacing. That's something I really like. Another thing
[01:39:10.420 --> 01:39:14.420]  I really pay attention to is the aroma of my male plants. I like
[01:39:14.420 --> 01:39:18.420]  To rub the stem with my fingers and then smell my fingers and see what it smells like
[01:39:18.420 --> 01:39:22.420]  A plant that has a fruity smell is going to make fruity progeny
[01:39:22.420 --> 01:39:26.420]  When I am breeding, I kind of lean towards the more fuel-y, more funky
[01:39:26.420 --> 01:39:30.420]  Sort of smelling things. I have a male plant that smells like puke or
[01:39:30.420 --> 01:39:34.420]  Vomit. That is a great male for breeding. I think it passes on great traits
[01:39:34.420 --> 01:39:38.420]  One thing that I really like to see in a male plant, and it's kind of odd
[01:39:38.420 --> 01:39:42.420]  It doesn't happen all the time, but trichomes. I really love to see trichomes
[01:39:42.420 --> 01:39:46.420]  On a male plant. You have to let them flower. They have to get about four
[01:39:46.420 --> 01:39:50.420]  Five, maybe even six weeks into flowering before you'll see the trichomes
[01:39:50.420 --> 01:39:54.420]  But I like to see trichomes on a male plant. That tells me that it is going to make
[01:39:54.420 --> 01:39:58.420]  Trichome-laden, resinous offspring
[01:39:58.420 --> 01:40:02.420]  And that's what we're looking for in the presley production. The plants that flower too early
[01:40:02.420 --> 01:40:06.420]  Right away are going to need to dominate in the breeding
[01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:10.420]  Cross. They're going to pass on way too much of their traits
[01:40:10.420 --> 01:40:14.420]  And they're not going to allow enough of the female traits to come across
[01:40:14.420 --> 01:40:18.420]  I've taken male plants to ten weeks just to see what they do
[01:40:18.420 --> 01:40:22.420]  I know what Solomon does. Ten weeks. My male plant is an Arise male
[01:40:22.420 --> 01:40:26.420]  That's a golden goat to Daybreaker. It's an F1
[01:40:26.420 --> 01:40:30.420]  They call it Arise. The male that I have chosen from that is known as King Solomon
[01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:34.420]  Because he is the king. I know what he looks like nine weeks into flower
[01:40:34.420 --> 01:40:38.420]  He keeps dumping pollen nine weeks into flower
[01:40:38.420 --> 01:40:42.420]  That plant can probably go ten or eleven weeks no problem and stay nice and healthy
[01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:46.420]  With the way I feed it. It would look wonderful
[01:40:46.420 --> 01:40:50.420]  I know what my plants do. Pay attention to the color
[01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:54.420]  That is going to pass on to your progeny. If it turns orange, if it turns purple, if it turns yellow
[01:40:54.420 --> 01:40:58.420]  That is going to happen to the offspring
[01:40:58.420 --> 01:41:02.420]  Also, speed of development is something that I pay a lot of attention to
[01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:06.420]  I do not want the male plants that start flowering early
[01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:10.420]  If I get a ten pack of seeds
[01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:14.420]  I do not want the first two to show me that they are males
[01:41:14.420 --> 01:41:18.420]  And start dropping pollen
[01:41:18.420 --> 01:41:22.420]  I would like the third or fourth one is most likely going to be the plant that I choose for breeding
[01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:26.420]  Maybe the fifth one, but probably not
[01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:30.420]  I'll explain why. The plants that flower too early and right away
[01:41:30.420 --> 01:41:34.420]  Are going to be too dominant in the breeding cross
[01:41:34.420 --> 01:41:38.420]  They are going to pass on way too much of their traits
[01:41:38.420 --> 01:41:42.420]  And they are not going to allow enough of the female traits to come across in the offspring
[01:41:42.420 --> 01:41:46.420]  I eliminate the early flowering males
[01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:50.420]  The males that start dumping pollen the soonest, they usually get cold from my garden
[01:41:50.420 --> 01:41:54.420]  I'm paying attention to how long it takes these plants to show me that they are males
[01:41:54.420 --> 01:41:58.420]  How long it takes for the male pollen sacs to start dropping
[01:41:58.420 --> 01:42:02.420]  And also how long it takes for the pollen sacs to open and start dropping pollen
[01:42:02.420 --> 01:42:06.420]  Those are things I'm really paying attention to
[01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:10.420]  I also like to pay attention to how much pollen comes out
[01:42:10.420 --> 01:42:14.420]  And how long my plants will keep dumping pollen
[01:42:14.420 --> 01:42:18.420]  Those are things that really matter to me
[01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:22.420]  I think a lot of pollen is important because I make a lot of seeds
[01:42:22.420 --> 01:42:26.420]  I like a plant that will keep going so I can keep tapping it every couple of days and get some more pollen out of it if I need to
[01:42:26.420 --> 01:42:30.420]  I like a nice robust male
[01:42:30.420 --> 01:42:34.420]  A lot of times I'll try to find a male that looks very similar to a female that I like
[01:42:34.420 --> 01:42:38.420]  If I found a 10 pack of seeds and there was a female in there that I really liked
[01:42:38.420 --> 01:42:42.420]  It was the perfect female out of the 10 pack
[01:42:42.420 --> 01:42:46.420]  I hope for a male that has the same shape and the same characteristics as that female
[01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:50.420]  Because I know that's going to pass on those traits that I'm looking for
[01:42:50.420 --> 01:42:54.420]  Something that I do not like out of a breeding plant is something that gets really tall
[01:42:54.420 --> 01:42:58.420]  Something that starts stretching and has a lot of inner node space
[01:42:58.420 --> 01:43:02.420]  It's going to make too much fiber. It's going to be more hemp than cannabis
[01:43:02.420 --> 01:43:06.420]  That's something I try to stay away from
[01:43:06.420 --> 01:43:10.420]  If you've got a male that is just shooting above the canopy of all the other plants
[01:43:10.420 --> 01:43:14.420]  Just pull that one out because it's going to create problematic progeny
[01:43:14.420 --> 01:43:18.420]  You want a male with a good structure that smells good, that produces trichomes, that grows the way you want it
[01:43:18.420 --> 01:43:22.420]  Usually if you get a 10 pack and you get 5 males
[01:43:22.420 --> 01:43:26.420]  You're going to want that third or fourth male as your breeder
[01:43:26.420 --> 01:43:30.420]  That's my intuition. That's usually what I've noticed
[01:43:30.420 --> 01:43:34.420]  If you're looking for a male that's fat, look for one that looks like a female that you like
[01:43:34.420 --> 01:43:38.420]  And then you should have yourself a nice quality male plant
[01:43:38.420 --> 01:43:42.420]  Make sure that it dumps plenty of pollen. Make sure that it produces nice big fat flower clusters
[01:43:42.420 --> 01:43:46.420]  You want big tight fat male flowers
[01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:50.420]  You don't want big fluffy sparse male flowers
[01:43:50.420 --> 01:43:54.420]  You want it to look like a big cola of male flowers
[01:43:54.420 --> 01:43:58.420]  The more male flowers the better. That means you're going to pass on that trait
[01:43:58.420 --> 01:44:02.420]  Fat male clusters are going to be a super desirable trait
[01:44:02.420 --> 01:44:06.420]  Another thing you should not breed with you guys
[01:44:06.420 --> 01:44:10.420]  Any plant that has ever shown any sign of hermaphrodism, do not breed with any hermaphrodites
[01:44:10.420 --> 01:44:14.420]  If it shows bananas, ever. Do not breed with it
[01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:18.420]  Now we know how to select females, we know how to select males
[01:44:18.420 --> 01:44:22.420]  Here is something else I want to talk about
[01:44:22.420 --> 01:44:26.420]  If you are breeding to narrow down specific traits, if you want your progeny to look like a certain thing
[01:44:26.420 --> 01:44:30.420]  Then it is a good idea to select one male
[01:44:30.420 --> 01:44:34.420]  If you've got a female and you've got a male and you're trying to get this part of this male
[01:44:34.420 --> 01:44:38.420]  And this part of this female into your cross, it is wise to use
[01:44:38.420 --> 01:44:42.420]  One male plant. However, if you want to
[01:44:42.420 --> 01:44:46.420]  Open up the breeding and see what you can create
[01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:50.420]  It's always fun to use multiple males of the same cross
[01:44:50.420 --> 01:44:54.420]  So if you have got, let's just say a rise
[01:44:54.420 --> 01:44:58.420]  If you're trying to breed with a rise, if you want to make a rise to
[01:44:58.420 --> 01:45:02.420]  What did I do a rise to? A rise to lemon skunk. I call it a firefly
[01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:06.420]  So you take a rise, I made a rise to lemon skunk. I used one arise male
[01:45:06.420 --> 01:45:10.420]  To one lemon skunk female because I knew what I wanted
[01:45:10.420 --> 01:45:14.420]  I wanted to put this robust growth from a rise, this cola size
[01:45:14.420 --> 01:45:18.420]  From a rise and this node structure and this thick branching
[01:45:18.420 --> 01:45:22.420]  Into this really flavorful yet kind of wispy lemon skunk
[01:45:22.420 --> 01:45:26.420]  Cross that I have. So that was my goal. So I knew that I wanted King Solomon
[01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:30.420]  By himself to pollinate that lemon skunk because my goal was the cross
[01:45:30.420 --> 01:45:34.420]  Of those two. However, if I wanted to
[01:45:34.420 --> 01:45:38.420]  See what I could create without narrowing it down and
[01:45:38.420 --> 01:45:42.420]  Since I plan on selling these seeds and putting it to market, I wanted it to be
[01:45:42.420 --> 01:45:46.420]  A very close representation. I wanted to be able to predict what I was making is what I'm saying
[01:45:46.420 --> 01:45:50.420]  If I wanted to open up the breeding and kind of create some chaos
[01:45:50.420 --> 01:45:54.420]  I would put multiple arise males in there. I would grow out a bunch of arise
[01:45:54.420 --> 01:45:58.420]  Seeds and I would find four males and then I would put those four
[01:45:58.420 --> 01:46:02.420]  Males in with whatever female plants I chose to
[01:46:02.420 --> 01:46:06.420]  And I would use the pollen from all four of those arise males
[01:46:06.420 --> 01:46:10.420]  And that's called an open pollination. What that's going to do, it is going to show
[01:46:10.420 --> 01:46:14.420]  A lot of different phenotypes because now I've got four different
[01:46:14.420 --> 01:46:18.420]  Fathers in there. So I'm going to get a lot of recessive traits
[01:46:18.420 --> 01:46:22.420]  From that male line that I would not have brought out by using one
[01:46:22.420 --> 01:46:26.420]  Male. So if you want to narrow down traits, if you're trying to narrow down your breeding
[01:46:26.420 --> 01:46:30.420]  And get specific traits out, use one male. If you're trying to open up
[01:46:30.420 --> 01:46:34.420]  The breeding and find new cool shit, use multiple males and that is
[01:46:34.420 --> 01:46:38.420]  Called open pollination. For the multiple male method
[01:46:38.420 --> 01:46:42.420]  Or for the single male method, you can use one female or you can use
[01:46:42.420 --> 01:46:46.420]  Multiple females, however you do it. The thing is when you do harvest, keep all
[01:46:46.420 --> 01:46:50.420]  Those seeds very well labeled and be honest with everybody
[01:46:50.420 --> 01:46:54.420]  About the work that you did. People that are growing the seeds that you create deserve
[01:46:54.420 --> 01:46:58.420]  To know exactly what they're getting. Alright, that's enough talk about
[01:46:58.420 --> 01:47:02.420]  Selection. I feel like I got you through choosing your males and choosing your
[01:47:02.420 --> 01:47:06.420]  Females. Now let's talk a little bit about timing your breeding project.
[01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:10.420]  Let's talk about the male pollen drop and the female ovulation times.
[01:47:10.420 --> 01:47:14.420]  Male plants like to drop their pollen sometime between day 14
[01:47:14.420 --> 01:47:18.420]  And day 21. It could start a little bit earlier. I have never
[01:47:18.420 --> 01:47:22.420]  Seen it start earlier than day 12 or 13, but around day 12 or 13, usually
[01:47:22.420 --> 01:47:26.420]  14 or 15, those male pollen sacks are going to open up and pollen
[01:47:26.420 --> 01:47:30.420]  Is going to start coming out of those male plants. I've never seen it start any
[01:47:30.420 --> 01:47:34.420]  Later than day 21. It rarely takes that long.
[01:47:34.420 --> 01:47:38.420]  Female plants are able to receive pollen as soon as
[01:47:38.420 --> 01:47:42.420]  They have pistils. As soon as you see those little white hairs sticking up out of your female
[01:47:42.420 --> 01:47:46.420]  Plants, they are able to receive pollen. However, the ideal time for them
[01:47:46.420 --> 01:47:50.420]  To receive pollen is not until around day 25 to
[01:47:50.420 --> 01:47:54.420]  32. If they received pollen too early, you're not going
[01:47:54.420 --> 01:47:58.420]  To get a lot of seeds. If you pollinate too early, your plants are really little.
[01:47:58.420 --> 01:48:02.420]  There's not a lot of space for a seed to develop. There are not a lot of bud
[01:48:02.420 --> 01:48:06.420]  Sites, so you just don't have as many seeds. If you wait too long, your
[01:48:06.420 --> 01:48:10.420]  Calyx pistils miss their prime, the plants are no longer ready to breed,
[01:48:10.420 --> 01:48:14.420]  And you will not make as many seeds as you wish you would have. So if you hit the
[01:48:14.420 --> 01:48:18.420]  Pollen onto the females between days 25 and 32,
[01:48:18.420 --> 01:48:22.420]  You will get the most out of your pollination.
[01:48:22.420 --> 01:48:26.420]  Okay, now here is a big part of breeding. The
[01:48:26.420 --> 01:48:30.420]  Timing of breeding is a huge challenge. Your male plants are going to start
[01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:34.420]  Dropping their pollen around day 15. Your female plants are
[01:48:34.420 --> 01:48:38.420]  Not ready for pollen until around day 25 to 32.
[01:48:38.420 --> 01:48:42.420]  So the trick is, you need to keep that male plant away
[01:48:42.420 --> 01:48:46.420]  From your female plants for about 10 days.
[01:48:46.420 --> 01:48:50.420]  If you start them at the same time, you've got to keep them apart for about 10 days,
[01:48:50.420 --> 01:48:54.420]  Or you're not going to get as many seeds as you want. So there are a few ways
[01:48:54.420 --> 01:48:58.420]  To do this. You can either keep your male in another area to where the pollen can't get
[01:48:58.420 --> 01:49:02.420]  To the females. You can start your females a little
[01:49:02.420 --> 01:49:06.420]  Bit early. You can start flowering your females 10 days before your males.
[01:49:06.420 --> 01:49:10.420]  That way they are 10 days ahead. That way when the male starts dropping pollen,
[01:49:10.420 --> 01:49:14.420]  They'll be timed up. You can get the females 10 days ahead.
[01:49:14.420 --> 01:49:18.420]  They'll be 25 days into flower when your male is 15 days
[01:49:18.420 --> 01:49:22.420]  Into flower. That will give you a week window to get the pollen onto the plants.
[01:49:22.420 --> 01:49:26.420]  And hopefully you can time it up perfectly. Hopefully you ran your
[01:49:26.420 --> 01:49:30.420]  Male plant at least one time before you bred with him and you know how long it's going to take
[01:49:30.420 --> 01:49:34.420]  For him to start dropping pollen. And it makes this math equation a little bit easier.
[01:49:34.420 --> 01:49:38.420]  You need him to be dropping pollen when your plants are 25 to 32 days
[01:49:38.420 --> 01:49:42.420]  Into flower. Another thing you can do is you can collect
[01:49:42.420 --> 01:49:46.420]  The pollen in a jar and you can apply it to the plants at the perfect
[01:49:46.420 --> 01:49:50.420]  Time. One good thing about having the pollen in a jar is that if you are running
[01:49:50.420 --> 01:49:54.420]  A normal crop that you don't want to seed everything, you can pull one plant aside,
[01:49:54.420 --> 01:49:58.420]  You can take it to another area and you can just use a Q-tip and dip that
[01:49:58.420 --> 01:50:02.420]  Q-tip into the pollen. You can apply it to a couple of bud sites that you want to
[01:50:02.420 --> 01:50:06.420]  Pollinate. Mark that branch so that you know it got pollinated.
[01:50:06.420 --> 01:50:10.420]  Let that plant sit for a little while. Let that pollen soak in.
[01:50:10.420 --> 01:50:14.420]  Let it do what it needs to do. Then get a sprayer and spray that plant
[01:50:14.420 --> 01:50:18.420]  Off with water. It will deactivate all of the loose pollen. Then go to your grow room
[01:50:18.420 --> 01:50:22.420]  And spray, hopefully you cleaned your clothes too, go to your grow room
[01:50:22.420 --> 01:50:26.420]  And spray all of those plants with water before you return that plant to the grow room
[01:50:26.420 --> 01:50:30.420]  And you should be able to make just a few seeds for yourself if you're very
[01:50:30.420 --> 01:50:34.420]  Careful. You must be very careful and you'll get better at this as time goes on.
[01:50:34.420 --> 01:50:38.420]  But it's an idea. If you've got that jar of pollen sitting there, the options are
[01:50:38.420 --> 01:50:42.420]  Endless. You can pollinate one plant. You can pollinate the entire crop. I've always
[01:50:42.420 --> 01:50:46.420]  Got a jar of pollen on hand. So let's talk about pollination
[01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:50.420]  You guys. There are a couple of really easy ways to pollinate your plants.
[01:50:50.420 --> 01:50:54.420]  You have a male plant that is dropping pollen and you've got female plants that are
[01:50:54.420 --> 01:50:58.420]  Ready for pollen. You can either take the male plant right into the grow where
[01:50:58.420 --> 01:51:02.420]  The females are and give it a nice shake and just watch that cloud of
[01:51:02.420 --> 01:51:06.420]  Dust come out of it. All of that pollen is now airborne. It's going to land on your
[01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:10.420]  Females. Every piece of pollen that touches a pistil will now
[01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:14.420]  Be absorbed. It'll become a seed. You have just pollinated your plants.
[01:51:14.420 --> 01:51:18.420]  You can set that male plant in front of a fan and just turn
[01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:22.420]  The fan on and watch it blow pollen all over your female plants.
[01:51:22.420 --> 01:51:26.420]  You can cut the plant down and carry it into the room
[01:51:26.420 --> 01:51:30.420]  And you can actually smack it up against the female plants if you want.
[01:51:30.420 --> 01:51:34.420]  I have done and seen this done and it works. Last time
[01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:38.420]  I had my male plant way too big the last time I did a breeding project.
[01:51:38.420 --> 01:51:42.420]  There was no moving it because if I would have moved it, pollen would have gone everywhere.
[01:51:42.420 --> 01:51:46.420]  I did not want to waste that much pollen. I had a small area of females.
[01:51:46.420 --> 01:51:50.420]  I walked over to the male plant and I cut a branch off of the male plant
[01:51:50.420 --> 01:51:54.420]  And when I cut it, a little bit of pollen came out because of the scissor click.
[01:51:54.420 --> 01:51:58.420]  I held the branch, I gave it a cut, and I walked that branch over
[01:51:58.420 --> 01:52:02.420]  To the females and I held it just a couple of inches above the female plants
[01:52:02.420 --> 01:52:06.420]  And I gave it a nice shake. You could just see the cloud of pollen come out.
[01:52:06.420 --> 01:52:10.420]  I gave it another shake and then I flicked it. Just a flick.
[01:52:10.420 --> 01:52:14.420]  Just like that. Tons of pollen came out. It probably took one
[01:52:14.420 --> 01:52:18.420]  Medium sized branch to pollinate an entire light worth of plants.
[01:52:18.420 --> 01:52:22.420]  Of course I used two or three branches because I wanted to make sure to get enough pollen
[01:52:22.420 --> 01:52:26.420]  In there. You can either move the male plant to the room
[01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:30.420]  And leave it alive and give it a shake and let it pollinate naturally.
[01:52:30.420 --> 01:52:34.420]  You can put a fan in front of it and blow it around. I've actually seen guys hit the fan
[01:52:34.420 --> 01:52:38.420]  With the male plant so that way it hits it and it just fucking explodes pollen everywhere.
[01:52:38.420 --> 01:52:42.420]  You can cut a branch off and carry the branch to the room.
[01:52:42.420 --> 01:52:46.420]  Also, another thing that you can do, if you've got a jar of stored pollen
[01:52:46.420 --> 01:52:50.420]  And I'm going to teach you how to store pollen next. If you've got a jar of stored pollen, all you've got to do
[01:52:50.420 --> 01:52:54.420]  Is take that stored pollen and I just stick my hand
[01:52:54.420 --> 01:52:58.420]  My gloved hand into the jar of pollen. I've got a rubber glove on. I just put the hand
[01:52:58.420 --> 01:53:02.420]  Right in there and now my glove has pollen stuck to it and I'll just go and kind of sprinkle
[01:53:02.420 --> 01:53:06.420]  Above the plants and just touch the plants and they will get pollinated by that.
[01:53:06.420 --> 01:53:10.420]  You can put some in your hand and blow it if you want. All you need
[01:53:10.420 --> 01:53:14.420]  To do is get that fancy dust, that fairy dust, that pixie dust
[01:53:14.420 --> 01:53:18.420]  All over the pistils of your girl plants and they are now pollinated.
[01:53:18.420 --> 01:53:22.420]  You know the plants are pollinated because when that pollen touches
[01:53:22.420 --> 01:53:26.420]  It will take very few minutes but the white hairs that you guys talk about
[01:53:26.420 --> 01:53:30.420]  The pistils, everyone calls them hairs, the pistils will start to curl
[01:53:30.420 --> 01:53:34.420]  Up and turn brown. That's how you know they've been used. They are now pollinated.
[01:53:34.420 --> 01:53:38.420]  They'll start to shrivel up and get weird. Sometimes the leaves will do funky things
[01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:42.420]  When the plants get pollinated. It's all plant specific but you'll definitely see the
[01:53:42.420 --> 01:53:46.420]  Pistils get brown and curved and withered and they'll look like
[01:53:46.420 --> 01:53:50.420]  They expired. Nothing's wrong. That is exactly what you want.
[01:53:50.420 --> 01:53:54.420]  So let's see. Those seeds are going
[01:53:54.420 --> 01:53:58.420]  To take about 40 to 50 days to get ready from pollination.
[01:53:58.420 --> 01:54:02.420]  So if you pollinate on day 25, around day
[01:54:02.420 --> 01:54:06.420]  65 to 75, your seeds will be ready.
[01:54:06.420 --> 01:54:10.420]  Grow it just like normal. Keep feeding it like you normally do. Don't give it as much
[01:54:10.420 --> 01:54:14.420]  Boosters. I talked about that earlier. Still flush because there's going to be material
[01:54:14.420 --> 01:54:18.420]  That will be turned into hash. We'll talk about harvesting your seeds.
[01:54:18.420 --> 01:54:22.420]  I should talk about collecting and storing pollen
[01:54:22.420 --> 01:54:26.420]  Before we get to harvesting your seeds. Pollen collection
[01:54:26.420 --> 01:54:30.420]  Is very easy. You've got that male plant. It's growing.
[01:54:30.420 --> 01:54:34.420]  You can either set a plate, just a white dinner plate, underneath
[01:54:34.420 --> 01:54:38.420]  Your plant. As long as you don't have any fans blowing or blowers
[01:54:38.420 --> 01:54:42.420]  Blowing it around, the pollen will fall directly out of the plant. Gravity will take it
[01:54:42.420 --> 01:54:46.420]  Right down and it will gather on that plate. You can use a mirror.
[01:54:46.420 --> 01:54:50.420]  I used an old drum head one time. I'm a drummer. I put a 22 inch
[01:54:50.420 --> 01:54:54.420]  Kick drum head underneath my male plant and all the pollen that fell landed inside the
[01:54:54.420 --> 01:54:58.420]  Kick drum head. So once you've got all that pollen gathered, do not let it
[01:54:58.420 --> 01:55:02.420]  Get wet. If water touches that pollen, it's fucked. It's over. It's useless.
[01:55:02.420 --> 01:55:06.420]  Once the pollen falls onto the plate or the drum head or whatever
[01:55:06.420 --> 01:55:10.420]  It lands onto, I used my ID or a credit card
[01:55:10.420 --> 01:55:14.420]  And I scoop it up into a nice little pile and then I let it dry.
[01:55:14.420 --> 01:55:18.420]  You need the pollen to get completely dry. If there are little
[01:55:18.420 --> 01:55:22.420]  Male flowers that fall in there when you're collecting the pollen, pick those out
[01:55:22.420 --> 01:55:26.420]  Because they have moisture and they'll fuck up your pollen. It will make that pollen inactive.
[01:55:26.420 --> 01:55:30.420]  It'll get funky. It'll get chunky. It won't be any good.
[01:55:30.420 --> 01:55:34.420]  If you're patient and you've got the room and the time, just put something underneath
[01:55:34.420 --> 01:55:38.420]  Your male plant and let it drop pollen and then you can collect it that way naturally.
[01:55:38.420 --> 01:55:42.420]  If you don't have the space and you're not that patient or maybe you want to get more pollen
[01:55:42.420 --> 01:55:46.420]  More quickly, an easy thing to do is I like to cut the branch
[01:55:46.420 --> 01:55:50.420]  Off the plant and then I hold it over the plate and I just
[01:55:50.420 --> 01:55:54.420]  Tap it with my finger right directly onto the plate and then you get
[01:55:54.420 --> 01:55:58.420]  A lot of pollen just falls. You can use a mirror. You can use a Tupperware
[01:55:58.420 --> 01:56:02.420]  Dish. Something glass is ideal because it doesn't
[01:56:02.420 --> 01:56:06.420]  Stick as well and it doesn't get static. So if you've got like a mirror or a
[01:56:06.420 --> 01:56:10.420]  Big dinner plate or a sushi plate is ideal
[01:56:10.420 --> 01:56:14.420]  Cut the branch off, hold it over the sushi plate in a room with no wind
[01:56:14.420 --> 01:56:18.420]  And away from all your female plants. Just tap. I use tap tech is what
[01:56:18.420 --> 01:56:22.420]  I call it. Just tap that pollen right out of the branch. Just tap
[01:56:22.420 --> 01:56:26.420]  It right onto the plate, right onto the mirror and just let it dry and then scoop
[01:56:26.420 --> 01:56:30.420]  It up and put it into a glass jar. It is a good
[01:56:30.420 --> 01:56:34.420]  Idea to put a silicate package in there, not a bovida pack.
[01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:38.420]  You do not want to keep it humid. You want a silicate pack that will dry
[01:56:38.420 --> 01:56:42.420]  It out. You want it as dry as it can get. Pull all the male flowers
[01:56:42.420 --> 01:56:46.420]  Out, get it in a jar and let it get completely dry
[01:56:46.420 --> 01:56:50.420]  And then if you want to store that pollen, just put it in a cool
[01:56:50.420 --> 01:56:54.420]  Dry, dark place. A lot of people like to put it in the refrigerator. I do not do
[01:56:54.420 --> 01:56:58.420]  That. I've got a filing cabinet that is in a basement. I just put it
[01:56:58.420 --> 01:57:02.420]  In there. It stays in the back of the filing cabinet. It's cool. It's dry and it's
[01:57:02.420 --> 01:57:06.420]  Dark and that pollen stays good for a long time. I have used that pollen
[01:57:06.420 --> 01:57:10.420]  Six months after I've stored it and it has been completely viable.
[01:57:10.420 --> 01:57:14.420]  Another good way to catch pollen is a pollen collection bag.
[01:57:14.420 --> 01:57:18.420]  My friends at Hort Solutions on Instagram sent me these bags. I do not
[01:57:18.420 --> 01:57:22.420]  Know what this material is made out of. It is a thick paper. It is almost like a
[01:57:22.420 --> 01:57:26.420]  Filter. It feels like a filter for maybe a thick coffee filter but they made
[01:57:26.420 --> 01:57:30.420]  A bag out of it and it has a little clear plastic window in it so you can
[01:57:30.420 --> 01:57:34.420]  See inside. What this bag is for, you slide it over
[01:57:34.420 --> 01:57:38.420]  This would probably fit, if you grew a small male plant
[01:57:38.420 --> 01:57:42.420]  You could almost fit the entire male plant in there if you trimmed off the lower
[01:57:42.420 --> 01:57:46.420]  Branches and just used that one main cola. You could fit an entire plant or
[01:57:46.420 --> 01:57:50.420]  A large branch in there. That would probably be the top cola of one of
[01:57:50.420 --> 01:57:54.420]  My plants would fit right inside there. Then you seal it at the bottom with either
[01:57:54.420 --> 01:57:58.420]  Some tape or a rubber band and when it starts to pollinate, the pollen
[01:57:58.420 --> 01:58:02.420]  Cannot get out of the bag but the air can flow through the bag so that the
[01:58:02.420 --> 01:58:06.420]  Plants will live. They don't die because they're still getting light and air
[01:58:06.420 --> 01:58:10.420]  But when the plant starts to drop its pollen, you can watch the pollen come out
[01:58:10.420 --> 01:58:14.420]  And the pollen doesn't go anywhere. It stays right inside the bag. Once you feel like you've got enough
[01:58:14.420 --> 01:58:18.420]  Pollen or that plant has expired and it's going to quit making pollen,
[01:58:18.420 --> 01:58:22.420]  You can cut the branch and then open the bag up and take the
[01:58:22.420 --> 01:58:26.420]  Bud out or the branch or the plant, take that out, give it a good shake before you take
[01:58:26.420 --> 01:58:30.420]  The branch out and then all of your pollen will be contained inside that bag and you can
[01:58:30.420 --> 01:58:34.420]  Pour that into a jar or whatever type of container you're going to keep
[01:58:34.420 --> 01:58:38.420]  It in and then pull out the male flowers, get your silicate pack in there
[01:58:38.420 --> 01:58:42.420]  And now you have got pollen that you gathered on your own in a bag.
[01:58:42.420 --> 01:58:46.420]  Also, this bag works in reverse. If you want to pollinate
[01:58:46.420 --> 01:58:50.420]  One branch of a plant, so you have that jar of pollen,
[01:58:50.420 --> 01:58:54.420]  You take your plant like I talked about earlier, take it to a safe place with no wind, use a q-tip
[01:58:54.420 --> 01:58:58.420]  Or a paintbrush, dip it into your jar of pollen, paint that onto a bud,
[01:58:58.420 --> 01:59:02.420]  Then you put this bag over it and then that will prevent that pollen
[01:59:02.420 --> 01:59:06.420]  From getting into the rest of your grow room. So it works as a catch
[01:59:06.420 --> 01:59:10.420]  Or as sort of a pollen condom. It's a great device. If you guys are interested
[01:59:10.420 --> 01:59:14.420]  In one, they do not pay me to say this. I just think it's a great product. I am checking
[01:59:14.420 --> 01:59:18.420]  To make sure I give you the right web address. It is www.hort-solutions.com
[01:59:18.420 --> 01:59:22.420]  That's hort-solutions.com
[01:59:22.420 --> 01:59:26.420]  If you want to follow them on Instagram, it's hort-solutions
[01:59:26.420 --> 01:59:30.420]  It's a great product, great way to catch pollen.
[01:59:30.420 --> 01:59:34.420]  Alright, so that is how you collect your pollen. Storing pollen, I told you how to do that.
[01:59:34.420 --> 01:59:38.420]  Just keep it in a cool, dry, dark place. Now let's talk about
[01:59:38.420 --> 01:59:42.420]  Harvesting your seeds. You guys, I have been going for an hour and six minutes and honestly my voice
[01:59:42.420 --> 01:59:46.420]  Is starting to get tired, so I am going to start going a little more quickly.
[01:59:46.420 --> 01:59:50.420]  Harvesting seeds is very easy. Just like any other harvest,
[01:59:50.420 --> 01:59:54.420]  About 14 days before you begin harvesting, start flushing your plants.
[01:59:54.420 --> 01:59:58.420]  All you have to do is feed your plants clean, pH balanced water
[01:59:58.420 --> 02:00:02.420]  For the last 10-14 days of your flowering cycle and your plants
[02:00:02.420 --> 02:00:06.420]  Your buds will taste much better when you smoke it. Yes, I know we are growing
[02:00:06.420 --> 02:00:10.420]  Seeds right now, but there is going to be material left over. You may want to roll a joint
[02:00:10.420 --> 02:00:14.420]  You may want to turn it into extracts. You may want to make edibles out of it. So please
[02:00:14.420 --> 02:00:18.420]  Do flush it. Flushing is free. I don't know why people don't flush.
[02:00:18.420 --> 02:00:22.420]  14 days that you don't have to use nutrients. Water is going into the plants
[02:00:22.420 --> 02:00:26.420]  Anyway. It's fucking flush. I don't get why people don't do that. So, 14 days
[02:00:26.420 --> 02:00:30.420]  Before harvest, start flushing. 2 or 3 days before you chop down the plants
[02:00:30.420 --> 02:00:34.420]  Go in the grow room and pull off all of the large leaves. Any big leave with a pedial
[02:00:34.420 --> 02:00:38.420]  Any leave that's in the way, go ahead and take it off. The plants are going to get harvested
[02:00:38.420 --> 02:00:42.420]  They do not leave. They do not need those leaves. So, at harvest time
[02:00:42.420 --> 02:00:46.420]  Here is how I do it. This is what works for me.
[02:00:46.420 --> 02:00:50.420]  I like to chop down the entire plant. I like to hang that plant upside down
[02:00:50.420 --> 02:00:54.420]  I put a label on it so I know exactly what plant that is
[02:00:54.420 --> 02:00:58.420]  I write the date on it so I know what day I chopped it down
[02:00:58.420 --> 02:01:02.420]  I like to let the plants hang upside down until they are crispy dry
[02:01:02.420 --> 02:01:06.420]  You guys were pulling seeds out of here? We are not going to dry and cure this bud
[02:01:06.420 --> 02:01:10.420]  Let it get crispy dry. Sometimes, if you let it get too dry
[02:01:10.420 --> 02:01:14.420]  Seeds will start falling out of it. So, what I like to do is put something
[02:01:14.420 --> 02:01:18.420]  Underneath each plant. I leave them far enough apart to where if I've got
[02:01:18.420 --> 02:01:22.420]  Strain A and Strain B and seeds fall out, I know that those seeds are not going to mix
[02:01:22.420 --> 02:01:26.420]  I'll put a drum head or a box
[02:01:26.420 --> 02:01:30.420]  Or some sort of catch container underneath the plants to catch any stray seeds
[02:01:30.420 --> 02:01:34.420]  That fall out. Sometimes I don't even care about the stray seeds that fall out because I have so many
[02:01:34.420 --> 02:01:38.420]  That I don't even worry about it. I sweep them up and they go in the trash. Sometimes they get
[02:01:38.420 --> 02:01:42.420]  Given away as mystery seeds to friends. But, hang the plants
[02:01:42.420 --> 02:01:46.420]  Upside down. Let them dry. Let them get crispy. Once the plants get nice and dry and crispy
[02:01:46.420 --> 02:01:50.420]  I cut them into sections that are more manageable and I put them
[02:01:50.420 --> 02:01:54.420]  In a long Tupperware container and I just let them dry even further
[02:01:54.420 --> 02:01:58.420]  If I've got a whole bunch of Strain A, I will put all of Strain A
[02:01:58.420 --> 02:02:02.420]  Into one container if it fits and then I put on some rubber gloves
[02:02:02.420 --> 02:02:06.420]  And honestly, I just start mushing up the buds with my fingers and it just starts crumbling
[02:02:06.420 --> 02:02:10.420]  It just starts falling apart and you can just hear the seeds come raining out
[02:02:10.420 --> 02:02:14.420]  The seeds just come falling out of the buds if you did it correctly
[02:02:14.420 --> 02:02:18.420]  So, cut down the plants. Let them dry until they're crispy
[02:02:18.420 --> 02:02:22.420]  Cut them into manageable sections. Put them in a container. Either a pie plate
[02:02:22.420 --> 02:02:26.420]  A Tupperware container. Some sort of thing that when the seeds fall out it's not going to roll away
[02:02:26.420 --> 02:02:30.420]  Start crushing it up. Wear some gloves. Crush it up. You're going to hear the seeds come out
[02:02:30.420 --> 02:02:34.420]  Now you're going to have little stems. You're going to have dried bud material
[02:02:34.420 --> 02:02:38.420]  And you're going to have seeds. You can throw all the stems away
[02:02:38.420 --> 02:02:42.420]  Put all the seeds in a jar and then you've got a bunch of bud material that you can either
[02:02:42.420 --> 02:02:46.420]  Make edibles out of. You can give it to a friend. You can extract it
[02:02:46.420 --> 02:02:50.420]  You can smoke it. I personally like to make hash with my
[02:02:50.420 --> 02:02:54.420]  Material that comes from my seeded plants because I think something happens
[02:02:54.420 --> 02:02:58.420]  To the plant when it gets seeded and the oil that comes from it. I like to make BHO
[02:02:58.420 --> 02:03:02.420]  The hash oil that comes from it seems to get me a little bit better
[02:03:02.420 --> 02:03:06.420]  Of a high. A different high. It feels like it does something that
[02:03:06.420 --> 02:03:10.420]  Normal hash doesn't do when it's made from plants that were not seeded. That's just my opinion
[02:03:10.420 --> 02:03:14.420]  So that's how you harvest your seeds. Basically cut down the plants. Let them
[02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:18.420]  Dry. Put it over a container and crumble the seeds out. Hopefully you get a bunch
[02:03:18.420 --> 02:03:22.420]  Of seeds. Hopefully you have big round tiger stripe seeds
[02:03:22.420 --> 02:03:26.420]  Something that I like to do that you may want to do. When you think the seeds
[02:03:26.420 --> 02:03:30.420]  Are getting close to ready you'll be able to see them in the buds. There's nothing
[02:03:30.420 --> 02:03:34.420]  Wrong with going to a lower part of the plant and popping out one
[02:03:34.420 --> 02:03:38.420]  Seed every now and then and investigating it until you think it's ready. It's
[02:03:38.420 --> 02:03:42.420]  Better to ruin one or two seeds than cut down the whole plant early and ruin everything
[02:03:42.420 --> 02:03:46.420]  So about 30 days after pollination I'll go
[02:03:46.420 --> 02:03:50.420]  In there and I'll just pull out one of the seeds. It's probably going to be white. It's probably
[02:03:50.420 --> 02:03:54.420]  Going to be small. It's probably not going to be ready but now I've got an indicator of
[02:03:54.420 --> 02:03:58.420]  Where I am. I want to wait until the seeds that I pull out are hard
[02:03:58.420 --> 02:04:02.420]  You want to be able to put it on a table. I'm sitting at a wooden table. That's
[02:04:02.420 --> 02:04:06.420]  A wooden table. I want to set the seed on this table and push with my finger as hard as I can
[02:04:06.420 --> 02:04:10.420]  And I don't want that seed to crack. That's how I know they're ready
[02:04:10.420 --> 02:04:14.420]  Don't push as hard as you can. Don't hurt yourself. You want to be able to push nice and hard
[02:04:14.420 --> 02:04:18.420]  On that seed. You don't want them to crack. If they're white, if they're soft
[02:04:18.420 --> 02:04:22.420]  They're not ready. You want big fat fluffy tiger stripe seeds. Some
[02:04:22.420 --> 02:04:26.420]  Seeds that I make do not ever get a tiger stripe. They turn this gray color
[02:04:26.420 --> 02:04:30.420]  They're ready. Not all seeds are going to get a tiger stripe. What else do I need to talk
[02:04:30.420 --> 02:04:34.420]  About you guys? The people that asked for a long podcast, you're welcome. I'm an hour
[02:04:34.420 --> 02:04:38.420]  And 11 minutes in and I have still got a little bit of material. I want to thank you guys
[02:04:38.420 --> 02:04:42.420]  For listening to this long episode. I know I'm starting to get rambly. I'm starting to get tired. My voice is wearing out
[02:04:42.420 --> 02:04:46.420]  So I'm going to keep going. Storing seeds is very easy. I just keep my
[02:04:46.420 --> 02:04:50.420]  Seeds in a mason jar. I keep them sealed and I keep them in a cool dry
[02:04:50.420 --> 02:04:54.420]  Dark place. They're actually in a very similar place to where I keep
[02:04:54.420 --> 02:04:58.420]  My pollen. So now you've got a bunch of seeds. The next thing to do is
[02:04:58.420 --> 02:05:02.420]  To grow them out. One thing I want to mention is please
[02:05:02.420 --> 02:05:06.420]  Do not sell untested seeds. That's
[02:05:06.420 --> 02:05:10.420]  Fucked up. Don't do that. If you make some seeds, grow them. Germinate
[02:05:10.420 --> 02:05:14.420]  Them. Write down how many you started. Write down the germination rate. If you don't get
[02:05:14.420 --> 02:05:18.420]  At least a 70% germination rate, try two or three times. If you don't get
[02:05:18.420 --> 02:05:22.420]  At least a 70% germination rate, something's wrong with the seeds. They do not need to
[02:05:22.420 --> 02:05:26.420]  Be sold. Don't sell untested seeds. Flower them
[02:05:26.420 --> 02:05:30.420]  All the way to the end. If they are hermaphrodites, don't sell them.
[02:05:30.420 --> 02:05:34.420]  If they are not quality seeds that make quality plants, do not sell them.
[02:05:34.420 --> 02:05:38.420]  If 7 out of 10 of those plants that come out of there are not something you would be
[02:05:38.420 --> 02:05:42.420]  Proud of smoking and be proud of posting a picture of all over Instagram
[02:05:42.420 --> 02:05:46.420]  Do not put that seed line out. There are better seeds out there. You can throw
[02:05:46.420 --> 02:05:50.420]  Seeds away. It is okay. You can grow them yourself if you want to. That is fine.
[02:05:50.420 --> 02:05:54.420]  But please do not put them in the hands of unsuspecting growers.
[02:05:54.420 --> 02:05:58.420]  You can give your seeds away to your friends if you tell them,
[02:05:58.420 --> 02:06:02.420]  Hey dude, I haven't tested this. Hey dude, I'm not sure what this is going to do.
[02:06:02.420 --> 02:06:06.420]  You can give those away, but please do not try to make any money off of untested seeds.
[02:06:06.420 --> 02:06:10.420]  Don't mislead people with what you're giving them. That is wrong.
[02:06:10.420 --> 02:06:14.420]  Also, if you, like I said a minute ago, it's okay to toss
[02:06:14.420 --> 02:06:18.420]  Something. If you make a cross, if you take pollen
[02:06:18.420 --> 02:06:22.420]  And put it on this plant and you make a bunch of seeds and you grow a hundred of those seeds
[02:06:22.420 --> 02:06:26.420]  And they are not way improved on what you started with. If the buds
[02:06:26.420 --> 02:06:30.420]  That come out of that are not better than the buds that came from the original female plant
[02:06:30.420 --> 02:06:34.420]  You did not do any justice to that breeding project. You need to get rid of it.
[02:06:34.420 --> 02:06:38.420]  Don't keep seeds just out of pride.
[02:06:38.420 --> 02:06:42.420]  Don't be prideful. Don't be arrogant. Get rid of some
[02:06:42.420 --> 02:06:46.420]  Shit that is not contributing to making cannabis a better plant. That's not what we're here for.
[02:06:46.420 --> 02:06:50.420]  Don't be afraid to toss bad stuff. If you're wasting time growing
[02:06:50.420 --> 02:06:54.420]  Shitty seeds, you are cock blocking yourself from growing
[02:06:54.420 --> 02:06:58.420]  Good seeds. You can throw away that bad shit. You can plant more. You might find fire.
[02:06:58.420 --> 02:07:02.420]  That's something that I really wanted to talk about.
[02:07:02.420 --> 02:07:06.420]  Alright, so you got a bunch of seeds that you made yourself. The next step is to grow them and find out what you made.
[02:07:06.420 --> 02:07:10.420]  That's always the funnest part right there. So plant a bunch of seeds.
[02:07:10.420 --> 02:07:14.420]  See what comes from it. See if you made a whole bunch of freaks. See if you just made the next
[02:07:14.420 --> 02:07:18.420]  Chem dog. You never know what you could have made until you grow it. So grow it out.
[02:07:18.420 --> 02:07:22.420]  See what you've got. If you're just making seeds for yourself, you can
[02:07:22.420 --> 02:07:26.420]  Stop or you can keep going. The next step would be to make an F2, which would be
[02:07:26.420 --> 02:07:30.420]  To find a male and a female that have the perfect traits and breed them
[02:07:30.420 --> 02:07:34.420]  Together and then you'll make more seeds. Those seeds are called F2.
[02:07:34.420 --> 02:07:38.420]  You'll find the perfect male and the perfect female out of those. Breed those together
[02:07:38.420 --> 02:07:42.420]  Again. Those will be your F3s. The seeds that come out of there will be the F3. The idea
[02:07:42.420 --> 02:07:46.420]  Then is to keep going all the way to F5 and once you get to F5, every
[02:07:46.420 --> 02:07:50.420]  Seed that you crack will come out looking like a clone
[02:07:50.420 --> 02:07:54.420]  Of the other one. You'll have exactly what you want nailed down. Of course, if you're just
[02:07:54.420 --> 02:07:58.420]  Making these seeds for your own personal garden, you can stop right here where you are with this original
[02:07:58.420 --> 02:08:02.420]  Cross and you can have fun growing that and then you can cross those seeds to more and you can
[02:08:02.420 --> 02:08:06.420]  Cross those to other things, but the options are endless
[02:08:06.420 --> 02:08:10.420]  Once you get this far. All right, I think I've got one more part
[02:08:10.420 --> 02:08:14.420]  To talk about. I'm going to press pause and take a dab in a drink and when I get back, I'm going to talk about
[02:08:14.420 --> 02:08:18.420]  Keeping male plants and then we're going to wrap up this podcast.
[02:08:18.420 --> 02:08:22.420]  Okay, I'm back. Let's do a quick talk about keeping
[02:08:22.420 --> 02:08:26.420]  Male plants around. I keep male plants just like I keep a female
[02:08:26.420 --> 02:08:30.420]  Mother plant. I like to keep it in a semi-large pot
[02:08:30.420 --> 02:08:34.420]  A five gallon or bigger. If you can keep it in an air pot or a root
[02:08:34.420 --> 02:08:38.420]  Pot, that is ideal. The reason for that is to keep the plant
[02:08:38.420 --> 02:08:42.420]  From getting root bound and I feel like the root pots kind of do a little bit of root
[02:08:42.420 --> 02:08:46.420]  Pruning for me so the plants won't get root bound because when they do get root bound, you'll start seeing
[02:08:46.420 --> 02:08:50.420]  Stress problems and some plants like to try to auto flower
[02:08:50.420 --> 02:08:54.420]  If they do get root bound. So I like a big pot. I like
[02:08:54.420 --> 02:08:58.420]  A nicely aerated soil or a soilless mix. Maybe mix a little bit
[02:08:58.420 --> 02:09:02.420]  Of cocoa in there. It's ideal to keep your mother or father
[02:09:02.420 --> 02:09:06.420]  Plants. This is a father plant is what I would call this. It's ideal to keep your mother and father
[02:09:06.420 --> 02:09:10.420]  Plants under either 18, 6 or 24 hours of continuous light
[02:09:10.420 --> 02:09:14.420]  One thing that I have shifted to that I learned from DJ Short, I run a
[02:09:14.420 --> 02:09:18.420]  19, 5 cycle for my mother and father plants
[02:09:18.420 --> 02:09:22.420]  I feel like 19 hours on gives them plenty of time for
[02:09:22.420 --> 02:09:26.420]  Growth and the 5 hours off gives everything time to rest. I think
[02:09:26.420 --> 02:09:30.420]  Everybody wants time to sleep. The plants want to sleep and also my equipment needs some rest
[02:09:30.420 --> 02:09:34.420]  So I think the 5 hour break is good for everything
[02:09:34.420 --> 02:09:38.420]  I like the shorter rest period because that way I know that none of my plants
[02:09:38.420 --> 02:09:42.420]  Are going to decide that they're going to try to flower and then I get to keep my
[02:09:42.420 --> 02:09:46.420]  Mother plants and father plants forever. Because if you do keep a plant for a long time, if it's around
[02:09:46.420 --> 02:09:50.420]  For a long time, the hormones move around. Sometimes it will get old and it will try
[02:09:50.420 --> 02:09:54.420]  To flower on you if you give it some darkness. Sometimes plants will try to
[02:09:54.420 --> 02:09:58.420]  Auto flower on you if they get root bound. So I try to keep them under
[02:09:58.420 --> 02:10:02.420]  The 19 hours on, 5 hours off. You can do 18, 6 or
[02:10:02.420 --> 02:10:06.420]  You can do 24 hours on. All three of these options will work just
[02:10:06.420 --> 02:10:10.420]  Depending on the strain that you've got and what your goal is. So I like
[02:10:10.420 --> 02:10:14.420]  To keep it in a large pot, good soil, keep it on a
[02:10:14.420 --> 02:10:18.420]  Vegetative light cycle and then something that I like to do is I take a lot of clones
[02:10:18.420 --> 02:10:22.420]  From it and I like to prune it very often and I also keep a
[02:10:22.420 --> 02:10:26.420]  Backup of my male plants somewhere else in a totally different location
[02:10:26.420 --> 02:10:30.420]  So that if something does go wrong with King Solomon at the A location
[02:10:30.420 --> 02:10:34.420]  There is a clone of King Solomon at the B location just
[02:10:34.420 --> 02:10:38.420]  Because he's my prize male. So as long as you keep your plant in a large
[02:10:38.420 --> 02:10:42.420]  Pot with good soil under a vegetative light, it should continue to veg
[02:10:42.420 --> 02:10:46.420]  Indefinitely. You should be able to take clones off of it forever.
[02:10:46.420 --> 02:10:50.420]  I would feed my mother and father plants just basic vegetative nutrients
[02:10:50.420 --> 02:10:54.420]  Give them grow A and grow B or whatever grow nutrients you're using
[02:10:54.420 --> 02:10:58.420]  Maybe a little cow mag occasionally and I like to feed them kelp products
[02:10:58.420 --> 02:11:02.420]  And before I take clones, between 12 and 24 hours
[02:11:02.420 --> 02:11:06.420]  Before cutting clones, I like to spray my plants with a
[02:11:06.420 --> 02:11:10.420]  Kelp product, maybe liquid karma or something like that but
[02:11:10.420 --> 02:11:14.420]  Mix up some liquid karma, adjust the pH and foliar spray your mother or father
[02:11:14.420 --> 02:11:18.420]  Plants before taking clones is some great advice. The email that I read
[02:11:18.420 --> 02:11:22.420]  At the start of the show actually said that the listener keeps their mother plants in
[02:11:22.420 --> 02:11:26.420]  Two gallon pots and keeps them about two feet tall and does some root pruning
[02:11:26.420 --> 02:11:30.420]  So I'm hoping that we get a reply from them and they are going to teach
[02:11:30.420 --> 02:11:34.420]  Us how to do that and I will teach you guys how to do that in a future
[02:11:34.420 --> 02:11:38.420]  Episode. Ladies and gentlemen, my throat and my voice are burnt out
[02:11:38.420 --> 02:11:42.420]  So it is time for me to wrap up the show. Before I go, I want to tell you about a service
[02:11:42.420 --> 02:11:46.420]  Called Patreon. Patreon is a service that will allow
[02:11:46.420 --> 02:11:50.420]  My listeners to make a financial contribution to the podcast. I'm not trying
[02:11:50.420 --> 02:11:54.420]  To get rich off this podcast. I'm not asking anybody to pay for the podcast. This
[02:11:54.420 --> 02:11:58.420]  Podcast will always be free because it comes from my heart and I want everybody that
[02:11:58.420 --> 02:12:02.420]  Listens to grow better cannabis. But if you feel like this episode
[02:12:02.420 --> 02:12:06.420]  Was worth a dollar or two dollars or however much you feel like it was worth, if you
[02:12:06.420 --> 02:12:10.420]  Would like to make a contribution, all you have to do is go to patreon.com
[02:12:10.420 --> 02:12:14.420]  Slash grow from your heart, make yourself a little Patreon account, type in
[02:12:14.420 --> 02:12:18.420]  The dollar amount that you would like to contribute. You can contribute as little as one dollar
[02:12:18.420 --> 02:12:22.420]  And I honestly don't think there is a limit on how many zeros you type in. I would
[02:12:22.420 --> 02:12:26.420]  Be grateful for a one dollar contribution. What I'm going to do with
[02:12:26.420 --> 02:12:30.420]  That dollar, I am going to continue to keep my website, iRegeneticsColorado.com
[02:12:30.420 --> 02:12:34.420]  Alive. That website is where I host this podcast.
[02:12:34.420 --> 02:12:38.420]  I pay for that website myself out of my pocket every year. It is
[02:12:38.420 --> 02:12:42.420]  $315 annually. I would just like your help to offset
[02:12:42.420 --> 02:12:46.420]  The cost of my website to keep this podcast coming to you for free.
[02:12:46.420 --> 02:12:50.420]  I'll never ask anybody to pay for the show, but if you feel like you can
